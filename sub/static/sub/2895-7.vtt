09:08.874 --> 09:10.861
That's weird.
I already did.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.493
[Knocking on door]

09:19.074 --> 09:20.841
Rachel or Donna?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.509
Who told you to check up on me?

09:22.544 --> 09:23.811
You don't think
I'd do that on my own?

09:23.845 --> 09:24.878
No, I don't.

09:24.913 --> 09:26.113
Well, I wouldn't have

09:26.147 --> 09:27.587
because I didn't think
you'd need it.

09:27.615 --> 09:30.751
Then I found out you got fired.

09:30.785 --> 09:31.919
So what?

09:31.953 --> 09:34.421
People lose their jobs
every single day.

09:34.456 --> 09:36.423
Yeah, not people like you.

09:36.458 --> 09:37.691
Something's going on.

09:37.725 --> 09:38.725
Why'd you get fired?

09:38.760 --> 09:39.881
You mean other than the fact

09:39.894 --> 09:41.428
that I picked a fight
I couldn't win?

09:41.463 --> 09:42.896
I don't care
how it turned out.

09:42.931 --> 09:45.332
You went 15 rounds
on your first shot.

09:45.366 --> 09:48.669
No way Jonathan Sidwell
lets you go after that.

09:52.073 --> 09:53.540
It was Forstman, wasn't it?

09:53.575 --> 09:56.276
I only got his money
if I agreed to cut Sidwell

09:56.311 --> 09:58.312
out of the deal.

09:58.346 --> 09:59.880
And Sidwell found out.

09:59.914 --> 10:01.515
He didn't just find out.

10:01.549 --> 10:02.549
Forstman told him.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.485
[Scoffs]
That son of a bitch.

10:04.519 --> 10:05.686
Yeah, there's more.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.855
That son of a bitch
has offered me a job.

10:07.889 --> 10:10.357
Mike, you can't do it,
and you know it.

10:10.391 --> 10:12.459
What choice do I have?

10:12.494 --> 10:14.261
I was an investment banker
for ten minutes,

10:14.295 --> 10:16.463
and I blew the only deal
I'm ever gonna get near.

10:16.498 --> 10:18.866
Well, that sounds exactly
like the kind of bullshit

10:18.900 --> 10:21.168
Forstman tells people
to wrap them around his finger.

10:21.202 --> 10:22.870
- Doesn't mean it's not true.
- Yes, it does.

10:22.904 --> 10:25.439
I could get you
five interviews before tomorrow.

10:25.473 --> 10:26.640
And how are you going
to do that?

10:26.674 --> 10:28.675
By making
five goddamn phone calls.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.777
And what are you gonna say
when they answer?

10:30.812 --> 10:31.945
You gonna tell them

10:31.980 --> 10:33.514
I was a Harvard-educated lawyer
working for you?

10:33.548 --> 10:34.648
Because you do that,

10:34.682 --> 10:37.251
I might as well go back
to being a fraud.

10:37.285 --> 10:39.419
[Sighs]

10:39.454 --> 10:42.156
What if I can get Jessica
to take you back?

10:42.190 --> 10:44.591
[Chuckles]

10:44.626 --> 10:46.527
What if you could bring
my parents back to life?

10:46.561 --> 10:47.694
Because both those things

10:47.729 --> 10:49.630
have about the same chance
of happening.

10:49.664 --> 10:51.498
- Mike, I'm trying to help you.
- And I appreciate that.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.200
But I only have two references,
Harvey,

10:53.234 --> 10:55.035
you, who has to lie for me,

10:55.069 --> 10:56.570
and Jonathan,
who wants to kill me.

10:56.604 --> 10:59.973
- Mike.
- Harvey, it's enough.

11:00.008 --> 11:01.275
As much as you want to help me,

11:01.309 --> 11:03.477
you have no idea what it is

11:03.511 --> 11:07.381
to have been a fraud
and have to start all over.

11:07.415 --> 11:10.017
I don't.

11:10.051 --> 11:11.485
But someone else does.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.935
Well, well.

11:21.970 --> 11:25.706
If it isn't employee
number 7611053.

11:25.740 --> 11:26.740
You still remember that.

11:26.774 --> 11:27.908
I lied on my resume.

11:27.942 --> 11:30.878
I never lied about having a head
for numbers.

11:30.912 --> 11:34.882
I never said how sorry I was
for what happened to you.

11:34.916 --> 11:36.383
You don't need to be sorry,
Mike.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.652
The truth is,
I should be thanking you.

11:38.686 --> 11:39.820
What?

11:39.854 --> 11:41.688
You know what I do now?

11:41.723 --> 11:45.125
Statistical analysis
for fantasy baseball.

11:45.159 --> 11:46.860
That's awesome.

11:46.895 --> 11:48.161
You don't know the half of it.

11:48.196 --> 11:50.163
My old, better job,

11:50.198 --> 11:53.066
I sat in my office,
crunched my numbers,

11:53.101 --> 11:54.568
made a lot more money,

11:54.602 --> 11:56.870
barely knew the name
of one person on my floor.

11:56.905 --> 11:59.673
Now my best friends
are people I work with.

11:59.707 --> 12:02.075
[Chuckles]

12:03.411 --> 12:06.580
Well, why'd you call me?

12:06.614 --> 12:07.915
The last time I saw you,

12:07.949 --> 12:09.349
you had no idea
what you were gonna do

12:09.384 --> 12:12.419
with the rest of your life.

12:12.453 --> 12:15.889
You had
to completely start over,

12:15.924 --> 12:17.457
and it looks like you did.

12:17.492 --> 12:19.626
I guess I--
want to know how.

12:19.661 --> 12:21.895
[Sighs]

12:21.930 --> 12:23.263
Start by starting.

12:23.298 --> 12:25.065
What does that mean?

12:25.099 --> 12:26.166
It means, for six months,

12:26.200 --> 12:28.702
I threw myself
a giant pity party,

12:28.736 --> 12:29.903
wondered how the hell

12:29.938 --> 12:33.307
I was gonna get out
of the mess I was in.

12:33.341 --> 12:35.375
And then one day
I said, "enough's enough."

12:35.410 --> 12:37.544
And instead of asking questions,

12:37.579 --> 12:40.647
I started looking for answers.

12:40.682 --> 12:42.182
And you found
fantasy baseball.

12:42.216 --> 12:44.351
No, I found out
that how much money you make

12:44.385 --> 12:47.854
is not the most important thing
in the world.

12:47.889 --> 12:51.458
Who you spend it with,
every day, is.

12:55.363 --> 12:56.763
Thanks, Stan.
I appreciate it.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.565
Whoa, Mike.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.068
Why exactly is it
you need to start over?

13:01.102 --> 13:02.102
[Chuckles]

13:02.136 --> 13:04.738
That's a long story.

13:04.772 --> 13:06.974
I have time.

13:07.008 --> 13:09.409
Another day, Stan.

13:11.713 --> 13:13.080
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

13:13.114 --> 13:14.247
Clear your schedule tonight.

13:14.282 --> 13:15.882
Done. Why?

13:15.917 --> 13:17.651
Jessica offered me
anything I want

13:17.685 --> 13:18.919
as a reward for my heroism,

13:18.953 --> 13:20.454
and we're gonna figure out
what that is.

13:20.488 --> 13:22.255
What's to figure out?
Named partner.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.558
No, not that.
Anything but that.

13:24.592 --> 13:25.926
What do you mean,
"anything but that?"

13:25.960 --> 13:27.661
There isn't anything but that.

13:27.695 --> 13:29.016
Oh, you think
I didn't ask for it?

13:29.030 --> 13:30.097
The words were out of my mouth

13:30.131 --> 13:31.565
faster than Esther
when she was 13.

13:31.599 --> 13:33.033
Louis, I don't care
about your slutty sister.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.434
You deserve named partner.

13:34.469 --> 13:35.602
And I don't care
that you don't care

13:35.637 --> 13:37.537
because it's not gonna happen.

13:37.572 --> 13:40.607
Now, we were given a chance
to take the high road,

13:40.642 --> 13:43.644
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

13:43.678 --> 13:45.345
If I were ever going to be
attracted to you,

13:45.380 --> 13:47.347
now would be the time.

13:47.382 --> 13:49.616
Instead I'll prepare a list
of demands befitting a hero.

13:49.651 --> 13:51.018
Good.

13:51.052 --> 13:52.719
And don't ever talk about being
attracted to me again.

13:52.754 --> 13:54.121
It weirds me out.

13:56.190 --> 13:59.192
[Phone ringing]

14:00.762 --> 14:02.062
The answer's no.

14:02.096 --> 14:03.463
You don't even know
what I'm here for.

14:03.498 --> 14:05.065
I know
what you're not here for.

14:05.099 --> 14:06.833
To tell me after a long night
of soul-searching,

14:06.868 --> 14:08.301
you've decided to give me
full control

14:08.336 --> 14:09.369
of Gillis Industries.

14:09.404 --> 14:10.637
You're right. I'm not.

14:10.672 --> 14:13.707
But I am here to give you
full control of this.

14:20.481 --> 14:21.982
This isn't public information.

14:22.016 --> 14:23.917
It will be in 24 hours.

14:23.951 --> 14:25.352
So it's legal to give it to you.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.787
And it gives me a 24-hour edge

14:26.821 --> 14:28.689
if I decide to act
on this information.

14:28.723 --> 14:30.590
Which, as you can see
from that filing,

14:30.625 --> 14:32.826
would be
a very profitable thing to do.

14:32.860 --> 14:35.128
And all I have to do in return
is use your law firm?

14:35.163 --> 14:37.164
I don't care
what law firm you use.

14:37.198 --> 14:38.231
I just want you to have
Mike Ross

14:38.266 --> 14:39.366
run point on the deal.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.567
Then we're back
where we started,

14:40.601 --> 14:41.935
and you can get the hell
out of my office.

14:41.969 --> 14:44.237
Jonathan,
I know what he did,

14:44.272 --> 14:47.340
but he thought he had no choice.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.776
When a person
thinks he has no choice

14:49.811 --> 14:51.478
is when you see
his true character.

14:51.512 --> 14:53.246
You think you have no choice

14:53.281 --> 14:54.948
other than to be vindictive
right now.

14:54.982 --> 14:56.750
This isn't vindictive.
It's common sense.

14:56.784 --> 14:58.118
And where I come from,

14:58.152 --> 15:00.520
you don't give the fox
another run at the henhouse.

15:00.555 --> 15:02.222
You wouldn't have even had
a shot at the henhouse

15:02.256 --> 15:03.490
if it wasn't
for him getting you out

15:03.524 --> 15:05.158
from under Tony Gianopolous.

15:05.193 --> 15:07.227
And I repaid him for that
by giving him his first shot

15:07.261 --> 15:08.361
at investment banking.

15:08.396 --> 15:09.396
And where I come from,

15:09.430 --> 15:11.164
the way you really repay someone

15:11.199 --> 15:13.667
is by giving them
a second goddamn shot.

15:13.701 --> 15:17.037
Then go the hell back
to where you came from.

15:17.071 --> 15:21.041
And, hey,
if you think he's so great,

15:21.075 --> 15:22.476
take him back there with you.

15:31.018 --> 15:32.185
[Knocking]

15:32.220 --> 15:34.888
- Louis, you have a minute?
- Not really.

15:34.922 --> 15:36.690
I'm in the middle of some
very important gift-choosing.

15:36.724 --> 15:37.924
What?

15:37.959 --> 15:39.292
Yeah,
wouldn't you like to know?

15:39.327 --> 15:40.527
But you never will

15:40.561 --> 15:42.062
because a person only gets gifts

15:42.096 --> 15:44.197
when they fix the mistakes
that Jeff Malone's made.

15:44.232 --> 15:46.833
Actually, Louis,
that's why I'm here.

15:46.868 --> 15:49.002
I wanted to thank you
for catching that error

15:49.036 --> 15:51.004
on the Wexler stock.

15:51.038 --> 15:52.139
You want to thank me?

15:52.173 --> 15:54.040
Yes, Louis, I do.

15:54.075 --> 15:55.842
Look,
I know you don't trust me,

15:55.877 --> 15:58.145
but you got us out of a jam,

15:58.179 --> 16:00.447
and I'm here to thank you,
man-to-man.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.848
Bullshit.

16:01.883 --> 16:03.550
You're here to kiss my ass
because you found out

16:03.584 --> 16:05.118
that I'm now above you
in the pecking order.

16:05.153 --> 16:06.586
Louis, I don't care
about the pecking order,

16:06.621 --> 16:09.422
and all I found out is that
you fixed this thing for Harvey,

16:09.457 --> 16:11.658
and I am here to thank you.

16:11.692 --> 16:13.126
I'm not talking about Harvey,
and you know it.

16:13.161 --> 16:15.095
- No, Louis.
- Don't play dumb with me.

16:15.129 --> 16:16.830
I'm talking
about Jessica Pearson,

16:16.864 --> 16:18.732
the woman whose ass
you've really been kissing,

16:18.766 --> 16:20.634
the very same woman
who came to me

16:20.668 --> 16:23.203
and asked me to check your work.

16:23.237 --> 16:26.773
Yeah, uh-huh.

16:26.808 --> 16:27.941
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:27.975 --> 16:30.510
I have some Llipizzaner stallions
to look at.

16:40.655 --> 16:42.656
You had Louis Litt
check my work?

16:42.690 --> 16:44.658
I was wondering
when we might get into this.

16:44.692 --> 16:46.526
Well, the wondering is over
because it's now.

16:46.561 --> 16:48.562
And if you were going to do
something like that,

16:48.596 --> 16:50.096
you should have discussed it
with me first

16:50.131 --> 16:51.565
before going behind my back.

16:51.599 --> 16:52.966
I did discuss it with you,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.335
and you stood right there
and said your work was perfect

16:55.369 --> 16:56.603
and I should trust you.

16:56.637 --> 16:57.904
You see,
that's the problem right there.

16:57.939 --> 16:59.573
You don't trust me.

16:59.607 --> 17:02.576
And now you're just rubbing
my mistake in my face.

17:02.610 --> 17:04.544
If the goal
was to rub it in your face,

17:04.579 --> 17:05.846
I would have done that already,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.646
and we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

17:07.682 --> 17:09.648
In that case, maybe
we should keep our conversations

17:09.684 --> 17:11.351
on a professional level
for a while.

17:11.385 --> 17:13.353
You're the one
who wanted to do both.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.555
And maybe I was wrong.

17:15.589 --> 17:18.825
I never said
I didn't trust you.

17:18.859 --> 17:21.294
I said I didn't trust
your work on Wexler.

17:21.329 --> 17:24.598
That's the difference
between us, Jessica.

17:24.632 --> 17:26.933
You see, when I say, "trust me,"

17:26.968 --> 17:29.469
I mean trust the man
who works for you

17:29.503 --> 17:31.238
and the man that's with you.

17:41.849 --> 17:43.783
You wanted to see me?

17:43.818 --> 17:45.018
You don't seem in a good mood.

17:45.052 --> 17:46.753
I'm not.

17:46.787 --> 17:47.868
We can talk about it later.

17:47.889 --> 17:49.289
I walked
all the way down here.

17:49.323 --> 17:50.891
We can talk about it now.

17:50.925 --> 17:53.693
I was just gonna ask
how Louis' talk went.

17:53.728 --> 17:55.161
Bullshit.

17:55.196 --> 17:57.437
That is not an "I have to come
talk to you" conversation.

18:04.705 --> 18:06.373
I want to bring Mike back.

18:06.407 --> 18:08.074
[Chuckles]

18:08.109 --> 18:10.043
That is not a conversation
I ever want to have.

18:10.077 --> 18:11.077
Jessica--

18:11.112 --> 18:13.046
Harvey, I haven't slept better

18:13.080 --> 18:14.547
since his last night,

18:14.582 --> 18:16.516
except for every night since,

18:16.550 --> 18:17.918
and I'm not going back.

18:17.952 --> 18:19.986
In case
you really were wondering,

18:20.021 --> 18:22.956
Louis took his thank-you
like a dick.

18:22.990 --> 18:25.325
And if that's all,
I'm going home.

18:34.669 --> 18:37.237
[Door clicks and squeaks]

18:37.271 --> 18:38.672
[Door thuds]

18:38.706 --> 18:39.806
Hey.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.975
Hey.

18:42.009 --> 18:44.144
Are you cooking?
Mmm.

18:44.178 --> 18:45.245
I make one thing,

18:45.279 --> 18:47.881
and I make it awesome.

18:47.915 --> 18:51.384
Mike, every single guy
thinks that his spaghetti sau--

18:55.256 --> 18:57.624
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

18:57.658 --> 19:01.394
Not every single guy
was raised by his grandmother.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.431
Now you sit down, shut up,

19:04.465 --> 19:07.400
and tell me about your day.

19:07.435 --> 19:09.769
What got you
in such a good mood?

19:09.804 --> 19:10.804
Oh, you know, nothing.

19:10.838 --> 19:12.105
Just spent the afternoon

19:12.139 --> 19:13.974
figuring out what I'm gonna do
with my life.

19:14.008 --> 19:15.842
Well, that sounds
like quite the afternoon.

19:15.876 --> 19:18.445
What did you figure out?

19:20.781 --> 19:22.449
Well, I figured out
I don't want

19:22.483 --> 19:24.050
to take the job with Forstman,

19:24.085 --> 19:28.388
and I don't want to be
an investment banker.

19:28.422 --> 19:30.991
So what do you want to be?

19:31.025 --> 19:32.092
I don't know.

19:34.595 --> 19:37.197
But I know
I want to be with you.

19:37.231 --> 19:41.034
- What are you saying?
- I want to start over.

19:41.068 --> 19:42.235
I don't understand.

19:42.269 --> 19:43.336
Rachel, when I met you,

19:43.371 --> 19:44.604
I had nothing in my life

19:44.638 --> 19:47.974
except what came
from being a fraud.

19:48.009 --> 19:50.577
And now I have nothing in it
except being with you,

19:50.611 --> 19:52.579
and I wouldn't go back
even if I could because...

19:52.613 --> 19:53.747
Mike--

19:53.781 --> 19:56.983
I don't care
what I do for a living.

19:57.018 --> 19:58.318
I mean, I'll figure it out,

19:58.352 --> 20:01.021
but as long as I have you,

20:01.055 --> 20:04.457
I have everything.

20:04.492 --> 20:07.293
Rachel?
[Sobbing]

20:07.328 --> 20:09.095
What--
I didn't mean to make you cry.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.897
I meant to make you
feel better.

20:10.931 --> 20:12.899
Hey, hey,
everything's going to be okay.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.602
- No, it's not.
- Rachel, what's wrong?

20:15.636 --> 20:16.936
I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

20:16.971 --> 20:18.571
- Rachel.
- I just need a minute.

20:18.606 --> 20:20.407
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm right here. You can tell me.

20:20.441 --> 20:22.242
What's going on?
I can't.

20:22.276 --> 20:23.910
Rachel, stop.
Yes you can.

20:23.944 --> 20:25.478
Hey, hey.
No, you don't-

20:25.513 --> 20:27.680
I don't deserve you.
- What are you talking about?

20:27.715 --> 20:29.482
Rachel, hey--
Logan and I kissed.

20:31.218 --> 20:33.453
What?

20:33.487 --> 20:35.555
We were just talking,

20:35.589 --> 20:37.123
and then he--

20:37.158 --> 20:38.491
He what?

20:38.526 --> 20:40.093
Mike, please.

20:40.127 --> 20:41.694
I am so sorry.

20:41.729 --> 20:43.296
Mike, no, please.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.965
[Sobbing]

20:46.000 --> 20:48.668
Please, it didn't mean anything.

20:48.702 --> 20:49.903
Wait.

20:49.937 --> 20:51.738
[Door rattles and slams]

20:51.772 --> 20:53.640
[Sobbing] I'm...

21:00.917 --> 21:02.312
[Knocks]

21:08.191 --> 21:09.325
[Grunts]

21:09.359 --> 21:10.493
This is how you handle losing?

21:10.527 --> 21:12.261
I'm not here
about Gillis Industries.

21:12.296 --> 21:13.329
Ooh, you gonna fight me?

21:13.363 --> 21:15.965
You stay the hell away
from Rachel.

21:15.999 --> 21:18.367
Well, that's up to her.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.569
But if she does come back here,

21:19.603 --> 21:21.337
it won't be to tell me
to stay away.

21:22.806 --> 21:23.806
[Grunts]

21:23.840 --> 21:26.742
[Both grunting]

21:26.777 --> 21:27.777
[Groans]

21:27.811 --> 21:29.278
[Grunts]

21:29.313 --> 21:31.948
[Grunts]

21:31.982 --> 21:33.716
Ah!

21:33.750 --> 21:35.685
[Grunts]

21:39.289 --> 21:40.289
[Groans]

21:40.290 --> 21:43.225
[Panting]

21:48.332 --> 21:50.333
I don't know what she told you.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.768
[Panting]

21:52.803 --> 21:54.737
But she let it go on
a long time.

21:59.543 --> 22:00.810
And she didn't just like it.

22:00.844 --> 22:03.179
She loved it.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.387
You told him.

22:11.421 --> 22:13.589
I don't even know where he is.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.825
He's at Harvey's.

22:15.859 --> 22:17.593
How do you know?

22:17.628 --> 22:19.195
Where did you go?

22:26.269 --> 22:27.970
Forstman?

22:28.005 --> 22:29.271
Logan.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.807
Gillis.

22:31.842 --> 22:33.576
Rachel.

22:33.610 --> 22:36.245
Get the hell in here.

22:36.279 --> 22:39.682
I never should have told him.

22:39.716 --> 22:42.451
Rachel,
there's no use thinking that.

22:45.122 --> 22:46.656
What if he doesn't forgive me?

22:46.690 --> 22:47.890
You don't know that he won't.

22:47.924 --> 22:49.992
You don't know that he will.

22:50.027 --> 22:51.093
And you're the one that said,

22:51.128 --> 22:53.162
"this will bore a hole
in his head."

22:53.196 --> 22:54.864
And you're the one who said
you had to find a way

22:54.898 --> 22:57.366
to trust him with the truth.

22:57.401 --> 22:58.567
He walked out.
I can't just--

22:58.602 --> 22:59.669
Stay here tonight?

22:59.703 --> 23:01.270
Of course you can.

23:03.823 --> 23:05.123
I'm not going back there.

23:05.157 --> 23:06.424
I'm not saying you have to.

23:06.459 --> 23:08.560
I'm saying
you need to calm down.

23:08.594 --> 23:10.128
Would you calm down
after someone

23:10.162 --> 23:11.529
stuck it in your face like that?

23:11.564 --> 23:14.566
I would if I knew he was just
trying to get in my head.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.534
How the hell do you know
that's all it is?

23:16.569 --> 23:19.037
Because that piece of shit
did it to you before,

23:19.071 --> 23:20.572
and I let him
because I'm his lawyer,

23:20.606 --> 23:22.040
but I'm not gonna let him
do it to you now.

23:22.074 --> 23:23.475
Yeah, well,
he got in my head.

23:23.509 --> 23:25.376
He put the image in there,
and now I can't get it out.

23:25.411 --> 23:26.544
Mike--

23:26.579 --> 23:27.779
Look, I need to know
if it's true.

23:27.813 --> 23:29.748
And what good
is gonna come of that?

23:32.551 --> 23:35.787
I just need to know.

23:35.821 --> 23:37.956
Then there's only one way
to find out.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.824
But you're not gonna find out
tonight.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.093
Here.

23:59.478 --> 24:01.179
Mike.

24:01.213 --> 24:02.981
Oh, my God, I was so worr--

24:06.252 --> 24:08.753
Oh, my God, your face.
What happened?

24:08.788 --> 24:11.756
You know what happened.

24:11.791 --> 24:14.159
You went to see Logan.

24:14.193 --> 24:15.593
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

24:15.628 --> 24:19.197
between you and him.

24:19.231 --> 24:21.099
Okay, why don't we just
go home right now,

24:21.133 --> 24:22.613
and we can talk
about all of it there?

24:22.635 --> 24:24.803
You're gonna tell me
what happened right here.

24:24.837 --> 24:26.538
Mike, I--

24:26.572 --> 24:27.739
I need to know
that I can trust you,

24:27.773 --> 24:29.040
because you said

24:29.074 --> 24:30.441
that it didn't mean anything,
but he said--

24:30.476 --> 24:33.945
- Mike, please.
- Did it mean something or not?

24:33.979 --> 24:36.281
It meant something
when it happened, but now--

24:36.315 --> 24:38.082
Okay, look.
Okay.

24:38.117 --> 24:39.584
I made a huge mistake,

24:39.618 --> 24:40.885
but you just asked
if you could trust me--

24:40.920 --> 24:42.620
Trust you?

24:42.655 --> 24:44.289
You didn't tell me about this
for a week,

24:44.323 --> 24:45.884
and then when you finally did,
you lied.

24:45.891 --> 24:47.292
I didn't lie.

24:47.326 --> 24:48.827
You walked out before I could
tell you the whole story.

24:48.861 --> 24:50.328
The whole story?

24:50.362 --> 24:51.930
There's no way you were going
to tell me that whole story.

24:51.964 --> 24:54.999
- Mike, please.
- He said that you loved it!

25:02.074 --> 25:03.274
And when I said
that it didn't matter

25:03.309 --> 25:06.044
what I'd do next
because I have you?

25:07.947 --> 25:09.848
I was wrong

25:09.882 --> 25:11.182
because we're done.

25:22.916 --> 25:24.699
Ohhhh, it is busy.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.976
Okay, listen, Rachel.
When you are done can you just--

25:28.011 --> 25:29.244
Holy shit, are you?

25:29.279 --> 25:31.280
No, I'm not.

25:31.314 --> 25:33.515
So help me, if Harvey
mistreated you, I will--

25:33.550 --> 25:34.550
It wasn't Harvey, Louis.

25:34.584 --> 25:35.918
It's Mike.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.319
That son of a bitch.
Where is he?

25:37.353 --> 25:39.821
Because I'll--
it wasn't him. It was me.

25:42.492 --> 25:43.659
Rachel.

25:43.693 --> 25:46.895
Look, I know
that he hurt you with Sheila,

25:46.930 --> 25:49.231
but I love him,

25:49.265 --> 25:50.566
and I lost him.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.800
And I don't really know
what to do.

25:51.834 --> 25:54.436
Oh, come on, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

25:54.470 --> 25:57.406
listen to me right now, okay?

25:57.440 --> 25:59.241
Whatever I may think of Mike,

25:59.275 --> 26:02.344
I have no doubt
that he loves you.

26:02.378 --> 26:05.581
And when two people
love each other,

26:05.615 --> 26:09.418
no problem is insurmountable.

26:09.452 --> 26:11.920
That's bullshit.

26:11.955 --> 26:14.656
And you of all people know it.

26:14.691 --> 26:15.924
What?

26:15.959 --> 26:17.559
You and Sheila
loved each other,

26:17.594 --> 26:19.628
and you still broke up,

26:19.662 --> 26:23.732
even though neither of you
had done anything wrong.

26:23.766 --> 26:25.233
That's different.

26:25.268 --> 26:27.769
Did you hear me?

26:27.804 --> 26:30.005
I did something wrong.

26:30.039 --> 26:31.840
And now he doesn't trust me,

26:31.874 --> 26:36.111
and I can't make him
trust me or forgive me.

26:36.145 --> 26:39.548
So it doesn't matter
how much I love him, okay?

26:39.582 --> 26:41.016
Becau--

26:41.050 --> 26:42.584
Okay, all right, listen.

26:42.619 --> 26:45.287
Rachel, you have so much
going for you.

26:45.321 --> 26:48.890
It's gonna be okay.

26:48.925 --> 26:50.525
And what good is any of it

26:50.560 --> 26:53.462
if I don't have the one person
I want to share it with?

27:06.743 --> 27:08.143
Logan,
what are you doing here?

27:08.177 --> 27:12.414
You told Mike after you
explicitly told me not to.

27:12.448 --> 27:15.951
I don't have
to explain myself to you.

27:15.985 --> 27:18.453
- Really?
- I didn't mean for it--

27:18.488 --> 27:20.422
It doesn't matter what you did
or didn't mean to happen.

27:20.456 --> 27:21.556
It happened,

27:21.591 --> 27:22.691
and I know why it did.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.126
What are you talk--

27:24.160 --> 27:28.063
You told him
because deep down inside,

27:28.097 --> 27:29.197
you want to be with me,

27:29.232 --> 27:30.565
and you knew this
would make it happen.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.767
That is bullshit.

27:31.801 --> 27:32.901
Really?

27:32.935 --> 27:35.337
Because that is exactly
what you said to me

27:35.371 --> 27:37.039
when I told Allison about us.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.440
That has nothing
to do with this.

27:38.474 --> 27:39.474
Rachel.

27:39.509 --> 27:40.609
And since
you obviously came here

27:40.643 --> 27:42.244
to find out where it is
we stand,

27:42.278 --> 27:44.279
let me tell you.

27:44.313 --> 27:45.814
There is no us.

27:45.848 --> 27:48.016
There will never be an us.

27:48.051 --> 27:51.420
And no matter what happens
between me and Mike,

27:51.454 --> 27:52.854
this is the last time

27:52.889 --> 27:55.290
that you and I are ever gonna
have a conversation again.

27:55.324 --> 27:58.026
- You're my lawyer.
- Not anymore, Logan.

27:58.061 --> 27:59.761
So whatever real or fake meeting
you have with Harvey,

27:59.796 --> 28:01.063
you can go to it now,

28:01.097 --> 28:03.165
but I won't be in it

28:03.199 --> 28:05.000
or any other meeting
you have here in the future

28:05.034 --> 28:06.902
because we're done.

28:14.977 --> 28:17.012
Louis, glad you're here.

28:17.046 --> 28:18.914
