00:41.160 --> 00:44.483
I have half a mind to report you
for grand theft auto.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.620
I'd like to hear that call.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.980
"Hello, police?
My son stole the Batmobile."

00:54.080 --> 00:55.740
You find this amusing?

00:55.840 --> 00:59.300
A little. I called and told you
to meet me up here, didn't I?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.260
But what does a town that was wiped out
by floods three years ago...

01:02.360 --> 01:05.205
have to do with the children
that have gone missing in Gotham?

01:08.960 --> 01:10.060
Maybe nothing.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.211
But I found it a little odd that every one
of them owned toys made here.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.300
You could have shared
the information a little sooner.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.060
An alternate response might be,
"Good work, Robin."

01:22.160 --> 01:23.980
But I guess I expect too much.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.607
I'm still a mile out.
Don't do anything till I get there.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.570
Word of honor, I won't do anything.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.804
- Remember, Robin. Justice...
- Not vengeance.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.248
The original owner of this place
was a man named Winslow Schott.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.807
A psychopathic killer.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.900
Sent to prison 12 years ago...

02:21.000 --> 02:25.180
by the testimony of his son
and primary victim, Anton.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.530
The son eventually took over the business
did a damn good job of it

02:28.630 --> 02:30.564
until the floods came.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.570
Hardly major news.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.220
How do you...?

02:35.320 --> 02:38.363
Oh, right. Your specialty.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.487
Victimized...

02:44.360 --> 02:45.487
children.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.571
You're worried about the little ones?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.723
Don't be.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.380
You see, I love them...

03:02.480 --> 03:05.086
more than you could ever know.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.100
Schott?

03:07.200 --> 03:10.540
Anton Schott died
when he was a little boy.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.340
When the monster took away
his innocence.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.380
I'm not Anton.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.769
I am the Dollmaker.

03:21.880 --> 03:26.761
And I've done everything in my power
to help the little ones survive...

03:30.600 --> 03:33.860
in this sad, cruel world.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.131
Psychopath. You'll pay for this.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.166
Protect me, children,
as I've protected you.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.700
I can take care of myself.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.860
An alternate response might be,
"Thanks, Batman."

04:20.959 --> 04:23.805
But I guess I expect too much.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.722
Robin, no.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.500
You're safe now.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.842
I swear to you.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.084
You're safe.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.609
There are dying children
in those cages back there.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.931
Some had to sacrifice
so that the others could live.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.530
Shut up.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.940
As children they're helpless,
but as dolls...

05:39.040 --> 05:43.330
As dolls no one can ever
hurt them again. No one can.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.363
You want to know about helplessness?

05:48.360 --> 05:50.169
Let me teach you.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.180
Why won't you listen?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.300
Why won't you understand?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.260
I love them.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.885
I love them. I...

06:12.000 --> 06:14.780
Shut up, damn you,
or I'll tear your heart out.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.260
Do you hear me? I'll tear it out.

06:33.320 --> 06:38.500
Justice, not vengeance.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.051
Don't doubt your instincts.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.004
What have you done?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.522
What have you done?

07:12.720 --> 07:14.500
You think that I...?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.540
After all these months together,
all I've taught you...

07:17.640 --> 07:20.929
you revert to the assassin
your grandfather wanted you to be.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.420
I could have done it easily,
but I didn't.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.045
Out of respect for you.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.180
State police are here.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.044
There are more on the way.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.887
Who did it?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.940
Figure it out for yourself.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.724
Robin.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.100
My God, Alfred, that was exquisite.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.601
Every ingredient fresh and organic.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.020
Shipped in daily
from a farm Master Bruce owns.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.020
You cook, you clean, you run the household.
I'm impressed.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.740
You should have seen me in my days
upon the stage, Miss Vanaver.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.540
My Falstaff was even better
than my coq au vin.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.570
He's quite the character.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.860
When I was little, I was...

08:34.960 --> 08:37.380
Well, let's say
I was a very serious child.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.500
Unlike the zany madcap you are now?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.620
Alfred's the only one
who could ever get me to laugh.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.566
After three months together,
I like to think I can too.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.100
You can, Samantha.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.380
You do.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.006
That and so much more.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.763
- There's something I want to show you.
- Your bedroom, I'll bet.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.682
It's still early.
Come take a look at this.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.460
- A new hobby?
- An old one, actually.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.340
The care and feeding of Gotham City.

09:19.740 --> 09:22.602
That's one of the things
that drew us together, wasn't it?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.620
The Waynes and the Vanavers
have both spent generations...

09:25.720 --> 09:27.802
trying to make this city great.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.980
My father had a saying:

09:30.080 --> 09:32.460
"Tomorrow is one dream away."

09:32.560 --> 09:36.380
Sentimental words, I know,
but they stayed with me...

09:36.480 --> 09:39.723
even after my parents were killed.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.482
Rather than focus on the demons, on the
darkness, on all that's wrong with Gotham...

09:46.600 --> 09:49.020
something I've been guilty of
for too many years...

09:49.120 --> 09:53.820
it's time to focus
on how exceptional this city is.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.900
And how much better it can be...
will be...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.525
tomorrow.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.882
But before we can build it
we have to dream it.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.420
And luckily, I have the imagination
and the capital to do both.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.140
And all they write about
is the billionaire playboy.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.140
Not to worry. He's here too.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.443
Unh, I was reading.
I must've fallen asleep.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.940
What's...? What's going on?

10:32.040 --> 10:34.646
Oh, and who might this be?

10:35.120 --> 10:36.281
I'm Damian.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.940
- Bruce's...
- My ward.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.780
Well, he will be soon.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.260
That's twice
you've surprised me tonight.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.090
Damian's had a difficult life...

10:45.200 --> 10:49.001
and I don't want those vultures in
the press corps descending on him just yet.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.460
So we've been...

10:50.560 --> 10:53.060
Keeping me a secret.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.340
Only until the paperwork is finalized.

10:55.440 --> 10:59.605
Then we'll proudly announce
the newest addition to our family.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.860
I should have told you, Samantha, but...

11:01.960 --> 11:04.220
No, there's nothing to apologize for.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.260
You take in this unfortunate child
and give him a chance at a better life.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.980
You have to do it your way.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.180
I respect that.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.380
Damn. Emergency board meeting.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.900
- Is everything all right?
- I'll tell them to reschedule.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.048
No. No, you should go.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.260
We'll have other nights.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.966
I look forward to them.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.443
And I look forward
to seeing more of you, Damian.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.688
I'll call you tomorrow.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.340
You were awake the whole time,
weren't you?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.340
Not the whole time.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.260
She's very attractive.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.140
A hair pretentious.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.642
- Definitely a little shallow, but...
- What are you reading?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.700
I've been working my way
through Dickens.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.580
- What did I do wrong now?
- Nothing.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.860
Fact is, I tore through Dickens
when I was just about your age.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.260
You ever see the 1948 movie version,
directed by David Lean?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.966
Ra's al Ghul
wasn't much of a movie buff.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.685
Well, I am.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.300
- Alfred.
- Yes, sir?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.580
Popcorn. Drenched in butter.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.220
And open up the screening room.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.500
I'd reconsider the butter, sir.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.523
Terrible for the cholesterol.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.900
You know what, Alfred?
Let's be daring tonight.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.651
- As you wish, sir.
- Coming?

12:32.920 --> 12:36.220
Okay, but I'm not sharing.
I want my own bowl.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.801
I think we can afford it.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.140
That's a little better.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.300
That's a lot better.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.286
You didn't really think
I'd let you sneak out again?

13:49.800 --> 13:51.860
You've got me under surveillance?

13:51.960 --> 13:55.220
- I thought we were making some progress.
- You show me a movie...

13:55.320 --> 13:58.722
and that gives you permission
to keep me a prisoner in my own house?

14:00.640 --> 14:03.291
It's for your own protection.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.860
Bad enough you won't let me out
in public as Damian.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.408
The least you could do
is let Robin have a life.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.722
If you were a little
more trustworthy, I would.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.724
You've never trusted me.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.001
Trust has to be earned, Damian.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.164
That works both ways.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.043
Accessing open file on Anton Schott...

14:56.160 --> 14:58.971
a. k.a. Dollmaker.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.685
Dollmaker deceased.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.605
Case closed.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.121
If that had been me dead
in one of those cages...

15:12.560 --> 15:14.130
would you have killed him then?

15:15.880 --> 15:19.760
We have to be better
than our baser instincts.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.045
I'm sorry about sneaking out
the other night.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.020
And the night before that?

15:25.120 --> 15:29.100
Not so much.
We stopped the Dollmaker, didn't we?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.900
I was raised to be the ultimate soldier,
a master assassin.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.128
Nothing out there can hurt me.

15:36.360 --> 15:40.244
Underneath that hard shell
you're still just a boy.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.260
If that were true, you wouldn't be
taking me out on the streets...

15:43.360 --> 15:45.563
hunting psychopathic murderers.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.980
Those papers will be signed soon.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.130
Everything will be different then,
you'll see.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.641
- Where are you going?
- Out.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.764
What about me?

15:58.080 --> 16:00.322
I got you a sitter.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.180
You're sloppy.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.340
No, I'm uninterested.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.931
Get interested.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.124
I don't need to be trained
by some circus clown.

16:41.160 --> 16:45.245
My grandfather taught me everything
I need to know about personal combat.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.204
Well, I was trained by Bruce Wayne.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.006
And every time they met,
he kicked Ra's al Ghul's ass.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.041
Just like I'm kicking yours.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.846
You really are a mass of ego,
aren't you?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.540
The pure and perfect Dick Grayson.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.900
The first Robin. Unh.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.924
Based on what I'm seeing,
I was the only Robin.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.529
You're just some lost little orphan
he took pity on.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.365
But I'm blood!

17:49.800 --> 17:52.326
I'm his son.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.646
You certainly are.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.881
Beware the Court of Owls
That watches all the time

18:29.000 --> 18:32.084
Gazing from the shadows
Behind cement and lime

18:32.360 --> 18:35.420
They see you at the hearth
They see you in your bed

18:35.520 --> 18:38.540
Take care, beware, or they will send...

18:38.640 --> 18:41.246
A talon for your head

18:41.760 --> 18:43.660
Is...? Is it true, Dad?

18:44.960 --> 18:47.586
Is there really a secret group
of rich and powerful men...

18:47.700 --> 18:49.603
who rule the city from the shadows?

18:50.000 --> 18:54.820
Who send their talon out to destroy anyone
who dares to even mention their existence?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.762
Absolutely not.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.180
But what if it is?

19:06.280 --> 19:08.740
It's just a story, Bruce.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.526
There's no Court of Owls.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.690
It's not real.

19:17.800 --> 19:22.740
And even if it was do you think
we'd ever let anything bad happen to you?

19:22.840 --> 19:25.140
No. Never.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.780
I promise.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.407
Your mother and I will always
be here to protect you.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.660
I believed it. I really did.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.888
I thought it was
the Court that killed them.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.246
And I made up my mind to find them...

21:18.480 --> 21:21.404
and make them pay for what they'd done.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.180
I knew that Harbor House
was the Court's headquarters.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.380
I watched them.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.166
The richest men in Gotham,
the most powerful.

21:38.720 --> 21:42.291
And if I searched long enough
I'd find proof.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.323
And did you?

21:57.160 --> 21:58.526
No, Alfred.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.180
Dad was right.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.081
It was just a story.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.406
It was just a story.

24:59.760 --> 25:03.367
We all look for meaning behind
the tragedies that befall us.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.088
And sometimes the meaning is there.

25:07.320 --> 25:12.660
But sometimes, Master Bruce,
terrible things just happen.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.481
No sinister plots. No secret societies.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.447
They just happen.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.004
I'm sorry, Kory, really,
but I'm stuck babysitting.

25:48.760 --> 25:52.322
No, I'm not kidding.
You're wearing what?

25:52.800 --> 25:55.780
The red one? With the lace?

25:55.880 --> 25:58.327
And the thong?

25:59.080 --> 26:01.128
Please. Don't tell me any more.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.004
Tomorrow night, I promise.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.884
We'll...

26:08.720 --> 26:10.882
Bruce is gonna bust a blood vessel.

26:19.280 --> 26:23.251
Master Dick, it's Batman. He needs you.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.460
Please don't hurt him.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.285
You bastard.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.965
No.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.124
How about a dance, old lady?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.682
Mind if I cut in?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.762
Grab your husband and go.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.569
Get up so I can hurt you some more.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.326
Enough, man. We give up.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.928
Who said surrender was an option?

27:43.440 --> 27:46.000
What are you waiting for, Robin?

27:47.080 --> 27:50.448
Men like this don't deserve to live.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.081
I won't finish it for you this time.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.580
The decision has to be yours.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.251
Wait.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.005
Who are you?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.009
My name is Talon.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.845
Come on.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.004
What is this place?

28:29.320 --> 28:30.925
Home.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.201
You can speak freely here.

28:42.320 --> 28:46.086
My respect for Batman
and all he's achieved is high.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.089
But there are lines he won't cross.

28:48.520 --> 28:54.420
Perhaps out of fear
or some misguided moral code.

28:54.520 --> 28:59.220
There are no lines I won't cross
in order to reach my goal.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.100
So you've come to Gotham to...

29:01.200 --> 29:04.204
To do what Batman refuses to do.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.730
Eradicate crime and criminals
once and for all.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.620
No lines. No limits.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.723
No rules.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.980
You're saying the end
always justifies the means?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.162
If the goal is a worthy one.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.820
Who decides what's worthy?

29:28.920 --> 29:32.540
That takes an exceptional human being.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.767
Like you?

29:34.360 --> 29:36.124
And you.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.207
Keep it.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.650
A gift.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.561
Why me?

29:48.680 --> 29:50.300
We're kindred spirits.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.687
I've been watching you for some time.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.926
I want you to join me.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.044
And if I say no?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.860
When you've made your decision,
use this to contact me.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.700
It's not a tracking device.
Feel free to give it a thorough inspection.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.530
I will.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.060
Oh, and one last thing.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.720
Don't tell him about me.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.644
Not a word.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.528
Where were you?

30:33.720 --> 30:36.121
What happened to you? Are you okay?

30:38.600 --> 30:40.620
You don't get to ask questions.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.780
- Now, where the hell were you?
- Out.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.340
Where?

30:45.440 --> 30:46.965
Just out.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.649
"Out" has suddenly become
a far more dangerous place.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.087
What's this?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.620
- That's mine.
- I don't think so.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.885
So, what are you gonna do now,
build a dungeon and lock me up in it?

31:00.160 --> 31:04.484
Despite what you may think,
I'm your father, Damian, not your jailer.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.540
A biological accident
doesn't make you my father.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.644
And it sure as hell
doesn't make me your son.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.140
There's a school in Switzerland
run by a retired general...

31:17.240 --> 31:21.006
who knows far more than I do
about boys and discipline.

31:23.720 --> 31:28.681
Try this again, that's where
you'll be spending the next year.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.860
You really played me for a fool.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.849
Not hard to do.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.420
You know, I did my share
of sneaking out too back in the day.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.940
Those things are out there, Dick.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.521
If Batman's a target, so is he.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.300
Then talk to him about it.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.700
- He doesn't listen.
- But, Bruce, he's just...

32:02.800 --> 32:04.700
He's not you, Dick.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.247
Before I took you in,
you had loving parents.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.460
You had a heart.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.060
- And he doesn't?
- That's not what I mean.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.620
Or is it? I don't know.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.963
Maybe biological ties aren't enough
to make a man a father.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.727
Or a boy a son.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.963
I thought you upgraded
the security wall.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.340
I did.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.780
I...

32:38.880 --> 32:42.203
I shut the outgoing system down, sir.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.780
Why?

32:43.880 --> 32:48.060
Master Damian said
he felt like a prisoner in his own home.

32:48.160 --> 32:52.420
I thought if he tried to leave again and saw
that there was nothing keeping him here...

32:52.520 --> 32:56.127
that you did trust him, then...

32:56.640 --> 32:59.963
Sometimes, you have to have
a little faith, sir.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.251
Since when have I been a man of faith?

33:04.480 --> 33:06.140
You did the right thing.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.540
He'll be back.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.643
He'd better be.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.300
He'll get over it, won't he?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.960
He never gets over anything.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.100
Running a little late, Samantha,
but I should be there in 15 minutes.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.124
I'm not a woman who likes
being kept waiting, Bruce.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.740
But I'll make an exception for you.

34:05.840 --> 34:10.527
Well, then, I'll do everything in my power
to make sure your patience is...

34:14.920 --> 34:16.684
Hang on a minute, Sam.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.083
Is something wrong?

34:20.199 --> 34:22.362
I'm not sure.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.380
Bruce?

34:27.480 --> 34:29.289
I'll call you back.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.540
What the hell is this?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.180
An opportunity.

36:04.840 --> 36:09.642
And one you should be
extremely grateful for.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.285
Welcome, Mr. Wayne.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.100
Not exactly a warm welcome.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.921
If we'd wanted you dead,
you wouldn't be here now.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.361
Who are you?

36:36.560 --> 36:39.610
The Grandmaster of the Court of Owls.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.900
I would say the Court of Owls
is merely a legend.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.060
A legend we are, but one rooted in fact.

36:47.160 --> 36:52.406
There was a time when the Court of Owls
stood behind every wall, in every shadow.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.140
We whispered and Gotham trembled.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.180
Not a leaf fell without our permission.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.140
A golden age.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.163
But all golden ages end.

37:02.280 --> 37:06.460
A faction rose against us
that even our talons couldn't stop.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.449
We were forced to retreat.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.660
But we never surrendered.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.571
- And now...
- You're back. Why?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.100
Because we care, Mr. Wayne.

37:17.200 --> 37:21.729
Just as our fathers and grandfathers
and great-grandfathers cared.

37:21.840 --> 37:26.460
We are, and always have been, the sons
and daughters of Gotham's wealthiest.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.531
We know far better than the rabble
what's best for our city.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.940
In other words,
you want to control Gotham.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.540
How else to restore a city
that's spiraled into chaos?

37:37.640 --> 37:40.326
That's become a cesspool,
a charnel house?

37:40.440 --> 37:46.580
A magnet for freaks,
lunatics and delusional vigilantes?

37:46.680 --> 37:49.764
We have a vision of Gotham's future,
Mr. Wayne.

37:50.040 --> 37:54.330
And so, we understand, do you.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.340
We invite you to join your vision
to the Court's.

38:11.440 --> 38:16.560
Together, we can raise Gotham City up
and return her to glory.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.100
That deluded vigilante?

38:20.200 --> 38:22.740
He's somewhat territorial
about this city.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.540
And not very fond of people like us.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.940
How do you plan on dealing with him?

38:28.040 --> 38:31.567
He's being dealt with even as we speak.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.769
I can't say I'm not intrigued
by the offer.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.180
But I'd like some time to think it over.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.340
Of course, Mr. Wayne.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.100
But not too much time.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.408
Sleep well.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.324
Hey. Unh. Unh.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.780
I sense a resistance
in Wayne, Grandmaster.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.140
He could present a problem,
as his forebears did.

39:35.240 --> 39:39.620
No. He plays to the crowds with his
bleeding heart and grand gestures.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.406
But it's all spectacle and ego.

39:42.520 --> 39:46.047
At his core, Bruce Wayne is one of us.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.811
I hope you're right.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.722
In my experience,
the Grandmaster is rarely wrong.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.180
Your confidence touches me, Talon.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.647
How is it going with the boy?

39:58.880 --> 40:01.088
He's taken the bait.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.487
And your work here?

40:06.880 --> 40:08.166
Progressing.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.140
Bring that setting up.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.380
Too cold and they'll shatter like glass.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.608
Yes, Grandmaster.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.780
Just imagine.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.362
Some of these warriors
are over a hundred years old.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.162
I envy them their immortality.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.140
Envy? You saw what happened
to the talons at the museum.

40:46.240 --> 40:50.100
They survived outside the caskets
for more than eight hours.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.682
The group before that lasted only three.

40:54.720 --> 40:59.780
And by studying our failures,
we've refined the resurrection process.

40:59.880 --> 41:05.126
These men will be able to live for a full day
before returning for regeneration.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.608
Immortality.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.500
But only 24 hours at a time.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.340
It certainly beats the alternative.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.780
And when these indestructible warriors rise,
you'll be their general...

41:17.880 --> 41:22.540
and lead them in a war on Gotham
that will reclaim this city for the Court.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.020
After I undergo the ritual
that will make me like them?

41:26.120 --> 41:27.700
You'll die, yes...

41:27.800 --> 41:31.601
but you'll be reborn as
something miraculous.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.685
One man's miracle
is another man's damnation.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.220
We've trained you
since you were a child...

41:37.320 --> 41:39.940
lifted you out of the gutter,
and you dare to...

41:40.040 --> 41:42.361
Not a soulless thing, Talon.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.570
A god.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.940
A great destiny awaits you.

41:47.040 --> 41:50.169
And I know you will willingly
embrace it.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.689
If that's what the Grandmaster wants.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.180
So I put four bullets
in Big Frankie's head.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.886
He never saw it coming.

42:28.680 --> 42:32.140
I was 23 years old,
and with those four shots...

42:32.240 --> 42:35.660
I took control of all the crime families
in the east end.

42:36.960 --> 42:40.800
By the time I was 30,
I'd taken half the city.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.924
You got stones, Mr. Draco,
that's for sure.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.300
Stones alone ain't enough, Gene.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.403
You gotta have brains too.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.620
And let me tell you...
Big Frankie? He had brains.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.500
All over the room.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.322
Holy Jesus.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.721
I might've croaked on the spot
if not for...

43:15.800 --> 43:17.291
Who the hell are you?

43:17.400 --> 43:20.563
I'm the evening's entertainment.

43:20.840 --> 43:23.241
Can I get a volunteer from the audience?

43:41.960 --> 43:45.522
I can pay you.
More money than you've ever seen.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.642
I don't give a damn about money.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.740
What I care about is payback.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.049
For the lives your drugs have ruined.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.084
For the widows and orphans
left in your bloody wake.

44:01.520 --> 44:06.367
You wanna help widows and orphans, punk,
go join the Salvation Army.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.489
Finish him.

44:24.440 --> 44:27.569
We found enough evidence
to put him away for the rest of his life.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.046
Finish him.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.486
He's already finished.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.007
Hey.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.802
Ain't you the Batman's brat?

44:39.160 --> 44:41.129
Not anymore.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.688
I know you're there.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.561
If you've got something to say, say it.

45:04.120 --> 45:07.090
I just wanted to tell you
that I gathered up the evidence.

45:08.280 --> 45:12.843
Draco's got an army of lawyers that have
kept him out of prison for years.

45:13.040 --> 45:16.283
But we could have erased him
from the equation.

45:17.680 --> 45:19.740
Three nights
we've been out here together.

45:19.840 --> 45:24.060
Three nights I've allowed
the Batman to come between us.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.163
But no more.

45:26.280 --> 45:30.300
Now is the time to step across that line,
become what you were born to be...

45:30.400 --> 45:33.927
or I promise you,
I will find someone else.

45:34.600 --> 45:38.241
It's just... I have to be sure.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.260
His voice is still in your head.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.681
"Justice, not vengeance."

45:43.080 --> 45:45.242
His voice is wrong.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.881
He's like a father to you, isn't he?

45:51.360 --> 45:52.620
You look up to him.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.940
Far from it.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.930
But, yes, I guess I do look up to him.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.180
I had a Batman in my life.

46:00.280 --> 46:03.380
He was a thief. A damn good one.

46:03.480 --> 46:07.849
And from a very young age,
he made certain I was too.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.803
I was his shadow. His echo.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.003
I worshiped him.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.403
And more than anything,
I wanted to please him.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.620
And did you?

46:37.920 --> 46:39.020
No.

46:39.120 --> 46:43.967
No matter what I did, how hard I tried,
I was never good enough.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.731
But what could I do?

47:22.200 --> 47:27.207
Not long after that, I was recruited
by a secret society, the Court of Owls.

47:27.320 --> 47:30.540
They took me in, raised me, trained me.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.041
Gave me strength and purpose.

47:33.440 --> 47:37.491
What they did for me,
I want to do for you.

47:38.320 --> 47:41.180
- You've done quite enough.
- How did you...?

47:41.280 --> 47:45.046
Not too hard to track, considering
the bloody trail you two have left.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.411
This is where you choose sides
once and for all.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.220
- No.
- We've got to stop him.

47:55.320 --> 47:58.006
You don't understand.
He's part of something bigger.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.900
He's using you, Robin, to get to me.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.323
Right. It's all about the great Batman.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.780
Well, for your information,
he sees something in me that you don't.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.380
I don't have time for this.

48:09.480 --> 48:12.166
Now, get out of my way before...

48:13.000 --> 48:15.003
Before what?

48:15.640 --> 48:17.609
Talon's right about one thing.

48:17.800 --> 48:22.044
The choice you make tonight
will define you for the rest of your life.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.283
If this is what you want, then do it.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.849
Do it.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.602
Now, let's go home.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.140
My home isn't with you.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.527
It never was.

50:56.760 --> 50:59.161
I thought this would relax you.

50:59.600 --> 51:02.524
What can I say? I'm a born worrier.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.360
Then I guess I'll have to relax you...

51:06.800 --> 51:09.611
all over again.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.560
Now, now.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.604
You know better
than to disobey the Grandmaster.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.660
We're not wearing masks now, Samantha.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.860
People like us are always wearing masks.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.620
What if the Court
doesn't go along with our plan?

51:33.720 --> 51:35.820
It's a brilliant idea.

51:35.920 --> 51:39.940
We have the perfect weapon
to destroy the Batman.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.380
And me?

51:41.480 --> 51:43.130
You'll have your wish.

51:43.240 --> 51:45.700
You'll sit beside me on the Court.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.580
My partner.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.700
My love.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.420
But I'm not one of you.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.841
I'm just a nobody from the streets.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.940
My father recruited you, trained you.

51:57.040 --> 52:00.647
I've known you since we were children,
and I know there's greatness in you.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.730
Maybe you do, but the rest of them...

52:03.920 --> 52:07.180
Vanavers have controlled
the Court for generations.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.180
Our word is law.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.660
Since when do you believe in the law?

52:11.760 --> 52:14.100
Only one law, my love.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.328
My law.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.420
The sewers again, sir?

52:21.520 --> 52:24.540
Seems I'm always up to my neck
in sewage one way or another.

52:24.640 --> 52:28.042
But this particular section
has been shut down since the 1800s.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.620
Took some work to get in here,
believe me.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.260
But what about Master Damian?

52:41.360 --> 52:43.300
He's a pawn in the Court's game.

52:43.400 --> 52:46.660
This is only gonna end
when I take them down.

52:46.760 --> 52:47.921
Hang on.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.980
I've got something.

52:50.080 --> 52:53.323
Signal is strongest right behind here.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.204
Sir?

52:59.880 --> 53:03.380
I've located a long corridor
that leads closer to the signal's source.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.540
Your transmission is breaking up.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.660
There's a faint aroma in the air.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.540
Moldy, sweet.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.245
Wait. I found...

53:13.800 --> 53:16.042
Best of luck, sir.

53:31.760 --> 53:34.940
Welcome, Batman, to the Court of Owls.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.740
We've been expecting you.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.922
You were watching me in the tunnels.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.282
In the tunnels, on the streets.

53:41.400 --> 53:45.900
We have eyes across Gotham,
observing and recording your every move.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.460
As I suspected.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.340
And did you also suspect...

53:49.440 --> 53:54.380
that those ancient sewers have been flooded
with an odorless psychotropic gas...

53:54.480 --> 53:57.166
that enters
through the pores of the skin...

53:57.600 --> 54:00.923
gnaws at the roots of the mind...

54:03.080 --> 54:07.260
turning the psyche back in on itself,
twisting and winding...

54:07.360 --> 54:12.810
until it resembles nothing
so much as a labyrinth?

54:40.920 --> 54:46.260
Beware the Court of Owls
That watches all the time

54:46.360 --> 54:51.260
Gazing from the shadows
Behind cement and lime

54:51.360 --> 54:55.940
They see you at your hearth
They see you in your bed

54:56.040 --> 54:57.980
Is this supposed to frighten me?

54:58.080 --> 55:02.170
You think you're the first ones
to drug me... invade my mind?

55:02.800 --> 55:04.420
I'll find my way through this.

55:04.520 --> 55:09.400
And I'll bring this whole damn Court
crashing down around your...

55:12.160 --> 55:13.620
That movie was great.

55:25.440 --> 55:29.811
Take what you want,
but don't hurt my family. Please.

55:41.200 --> 55:43.460
No!

55:43.560 --> 55:45.540
Do you understand now?

55:45.640 --> 55:47.380
When you put on that mask...

55:47.480 --> 55:51.963
you became as much of a demon
as the men you claim to oppose.

55:52.240 --> 55:56.962
You became one with the very forces
that killed your parents.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.260
And worse...

55:59.360 --> 56:04.606
you spawned the greatest monster
Gotham City has ever seen.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.648
Damian?

56:13.800 --> 56:16.326
Who will grow in rage and hatred...

56:16.600 --> 56:18.620
tear the heart out of Gotham...

56:18.720 --> 56:23.886
then leave a trail of terrible destruction
across the world.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.963
Damian, no.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.980
I'm sorry.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.767
I'm so sorry.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.963
Damian, forgive me.

57:07.360 --> 57:09.700
He's coming through, thank heavens.

57:09.800 --> 57:13.740
Good thing I found him not far from where
his last transmission ended.

57:21.400 --> 57:24.020
- How long have I been...?
- Seven hours.

57:24.120 --> 57:28.340
Unh. Damian. If those animals
get their hands on him...

57:28.440 --> 57:29.851
I've been out there, Bruce.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.020
- There's no sign of him.
- I'll help you.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.820
You're of no help to anyone
in your current state, sir.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.340
You need to rest.

57:36.440 --> 57:38.488
No. Don't you understand?

57:38.600 --> 57:39.966
I have to find him.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.928
He's my son.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.328
My son.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.580
Talon, introduce your protégé.

57:50.680 --> 57:53.460
It is an honor to present
this boy to the Court.

57:53.560 --> 57:57.660
I've seen first-hand
that he has greatness within him...

57:57.760 --> 58:00.286
and a grand destiny ahead.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.050
Perhaps that is so.

58:02.160 --> 58:05.005
But we must be certain of his loyalty.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.580
You have my word.

58:08.680 --> 58:13.049
We are the Court of Owls
and we require more than words.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.448
Your mask.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.523
Robin?

58:19.680 --> 58:21.900
So much for your loyalty.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.050
Toss the brat back in the gutter
where you found him.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.124
Wait.

58:27.520 --> 58:30.365
Robin, we discussed this.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.540
The boy.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.245
Bruce Wayne's ward.

58:39.760 --> 58:43.208
- How do you...?
- That means Wayne is...

58:43.400 --> 58:45.448
Batman.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.446
No. No, you're wrong. He...

58:55.520 --> 58:57.523
This changes everything.

58:58.320 --> 59:01.020
Imagine how deeply
we can hurt the Batman.

59:01.120 --> 59:04.260
Break his heart and his will
by killing this boy.

59:04.360 --> 59:07.220
No. He's supposed
to take my place in the ritual.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.220
- He's...
- You lied to me. Batman was right.

59:10.320 --> 59:13.020
- You were just using me to...
- Shut up. Shut up!

59:13.120 --> 59:15.340
I swear to you we'll find a replacement.

59:15.440 --> 59:16.726
Now, kill him!

59:17.680 --> 59:19.967
Yes, Grandmaster.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.484
Do it!

59:53.240 --> 59:54.481
Run.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.009
What have you done?

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.420
I'm not one of you.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.760
Never have been... never will be.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.968
That boy and me...

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.164
we crawled out of the same gutter.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.340
Talon, my darling, forget them.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.900
The two of us can...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.500
The two of us?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.411
Oh, my sweet Samantha.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.580
Be honest.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.366
You would have done the same to me.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.681
I've just sacrificed
a world for you, Robin.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.020
Now what will you sacrifice for me?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.009
You're insane.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.540
I won't ask you
to betray him any further.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.724
- But Bruce Wayne is a complication.
- Unh. Unh.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.645
He has to be dealt with.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.321
You'll be safe here till I'm done.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.330
You think you can stop him alone?

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.967
Who says I'm alone?

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.042
Red security grid up and active?

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.846
Unless someone shut it down
and didn't bother to tell us.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.260
Most unkind, sir.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.380
I don't know if it's Bruce Wayne
or Batman the Court's come for.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.884
But either way, they're about
to get a welcome they'll never forget.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.300
What the hell are these things?

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.380
I'm not sure
if they're actually alive...

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.961
but I've seen first-hand
that they can be destroyed.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.249
Activating panic room protocol.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.408
Bruce, no.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.530
End of the line, Bruce.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.963
Or should I say Batman?

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.780
Where's Damian?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.281
He belongs to me now.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.209
Little bird gave you up.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.460
We know all your dirty secrets.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.980
You used him. Manipulated him.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.260
If I did, you're the one
who made it so damn easy.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.762
But not as easy as this is going to be.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.641
Too many of those things
to fight without help.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.566
Progress report, Alfred.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.140
Soon, I hope.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.482
Soon may not be good enough.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.660
Pennyworth, this is Damian.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.140
Master Damian? Where are you?

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.900
- How...?
- No questions, just listen.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.162
The Talons can't function
in subzero cold.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.140
Alfred.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.620
A few final adjustments, sir.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.804
You see, I've received some pertinent
information from Master...

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.411
Open the damn doors.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.526
You would have made a good Talon.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.081
Now, I'm only gonna say this once,
you sons of bitches.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.731
Get the hell out of my cave.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.640
We've got to get to that utility core,
Master Bruce.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.201
Game over.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.860
You and the Court tried to take control
of my city and destroy my home...

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.900
but worst of all,
you messed with my kid.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.448
So this is gonna hurt
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.204
I've taken your boy.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.324
- And now...
- No.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.140
Damian, listen to me, he's not worth it.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.560
Let him go.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.569
Let him die.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.410
Like you let your father die?

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.249
Stupid boy.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.940
Damian, he'll never let you go.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.044
For us to be free, he has to die.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.820
The Wayne fortune will be ours.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.700
The Owls, they'll never find us.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.564
Tell him goodbye, Damian.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.300
You filthy ingrate!

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.485
Everything I've done was for you,
and this is how you repay me?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.920
Then so be it.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.243
You could never replace Batman.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.820
He's my father.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.442
Don't doubt your instincts.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.304
No.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.122
Are you all right?

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.888
I'm proud of you.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.889
Welcome home.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.247
No.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.005
I could have killed him.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.140
Maybe I should have.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.800
But you were in my head.
You wouldn't let me.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.562
You, Talia, Ra's, you're all in here.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.564
But where am I?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.446
How can I ever be the son
you need me to be...

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.770
when I don't even know who I am?

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.682
I have to go.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.044
Damian.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.020
- There's a school...
- In Switzerland.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.168
Yeah, you told me about it.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.044
No. No.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.403
This is a monastery in the Himalayas.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.260
I stayed there years ago...

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.886
when I was lost, troubled.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.620
And the monks helped me in ways
that proved to be very...

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.848
I don't need any help.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.850
But maybe I will later on.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.051
I've got some packing to do.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.260
Gotham P.D.'s collecting evidence
at the Court of Owls.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.681
I suspected Samantha's involvement
early on.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.931
S.T.A.R. Labs should have an analysis
of the talons' remains within the week.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.843
He needs this time
to find his own place in the world.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.089
He's a 10-year-old boy.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.282
No. He just looks like one.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.442
There's not another child on Earth
like Damian Wayne.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.500
When the time is right,
Damian will be back.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.446
And it won't be because I want him to,
it'll be because he wants to.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.122
And if you're wrong, sir?

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:24.370
Sometimes, Alfred,
you have to have a little faith.
