WEBVTT

00:01.672 --> 00:04.375
(Meredith) ACCORDING TO
ELIZABETH KUBLER-ROSS,

00:04.375 --> 00:06.377
WHEN WE ARE DYING...
(monitor beeping erratically)

00:06.377 --> 00:08.379
OR HAVE SUFFERED
A CATASTROPHIC LOSS,

00:08.379 --> 00:11.782
WE ALL MOVE THROUGH
FIVE DISTINCT STAGES OF GRIEF.

00:11.782 --> 00:15.086
(monitor emits continuous tone,
paddles thunk)
WE GO INTO DENIAL...

00:15.086 --> 00:17.518
PUSH ANOTHER AMP OF CALCIUM.
BECAUSE THE LOSS
IS SO UNTHINKABLE,

00:17.518 --> 00:20.791
WE CAN'T IMAGINE IT'S TRUE.
(Richard) CHARGE TO 360.
CLEAR.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.653
(monitor emits continuous tone,
paddles thunk)

00:22.653 --> 00:24.355
WE BECOME ANGRY WITH EVERYONE--

00:24.355 --> 00:27.058
ANGRY WITH SURVIVORS,
ANGRY WITH OURSELVES.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.529
THEN WE BARGAIN...

00:28.529 --> 00:32.163
(Derek) DAMN IT, O'MALLEY.
COME ON. LIVE. JUST LIVE.

00:32.163 --> 00:34.305
I.C.P.'s 30.
PUSH 70 OF MANNITOL
AND START BAGGING.

00:34.305 --> 00:36.507
(Derek) HE'S HEMORRHAGING
INTO HIS BRAIN STEM.
IS IT TOO LATE
FOR STEROIDS?

00:36.507 --> 00:39.039
WE BEG, WE PLEAD...
(Derek) HE'S HERNIATING!

00:39.039 --> 00:43.043
WE OFFER EVERYTHING WE HAVE.
WE OFFER UP OUR SOULS...
(defibrillator buzzes and beeps)

00:43.043 --> 00:45.076
IN EXCHANGE...
(paddles thunk)

00:45.076 --> 00:47.378
FOR JUST ONE MORE DAY.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.150
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

00:49.150 --> 00:52.183
(Richard) STEVENS,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:52.183 --> 00:55.186
(beeping continues)

00:55.186 --> 00:57.158
LOOK AT ME, STEVENS.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.230
(monitor beeping erratically)

00:59.230 --> 01:02.093
DAMN IT.

01:02.093 --> 01:04.295
WHEN THE BARGAINING HAS FAILED

01:04.295 --> 01:07.298
AND THE ANGER
IS TOO HARD TO MAINTAIN,

01:07.298 --> 01:09.640
WE FALL INTO DEPRESSION,

01:09.640 --> 01:11.142
DESPAIR,

01:11.142 --> 01:14.074
UNTIL FINALLY WE HAVE TO ACCEPT

01:14.074 --> 01:15.846
THAT WE HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

01:15.846 --> 01:18.179
WE LET GO.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.310
(beeping continues)

01:19.310 --> 01:22.113
WE LET GO
AND MOVE INTO ACCEPTANCE.

02:41.232 --> 02:43.664
I CALLED HIS MOTHER.
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

LET'S CLOSE HIM UP
AND GET HIM TO THE I.C.U.

JOHN DOE.

THE WAY OF THE BUS.

03:03.614 --> 03:05.916

"JOHN DOE IS GEORGE."

WHO'S GEORGE?

03:11.922 --> 03:14.225
YOU CAN'T TELL HER.
ALEX--

03:14.225 --> 03:17.428
SHE CODED IN MY ARMS.
OUT OF NOWHERE, SHE DIED.

03:17.428 --> 03:19.870
JUST... I'LL TELL HER.

03:19.870 --> 03:23.234
I'LL TELL HER
WHEN SHE GETS STRONGER.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.406
ALEX.

03:27.978 --> 03:30.241
YOU OKAY?

03:30.241 --> 03:32.813
I HAD...

03:32.813 --> 03:35.686
A DREAM.

03:35.686 --> 03:37.988
HE WAS IN HIS UNIFORM.

03:37.988 --> 03:39.890
WHAT?

03:39.890 --> 03:41.892
GEORGE IS GONNA DIE
IN THE ARMY

03:41.892 --> 03:43.894
IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.

03:43.894 --> 03:46.957
HAND ME MY PHONE.
I NEED MY PHONE.

04:02.313 --> 04:05.316
WHO SAID THAT WAS GEORGE?
WHY DO WE THINK THAT'S GEORGE?

04:05.316 --> 04:08.018
MEREDITH SAID...

04:08.018 --> 04:10.981
I DON'T KNOW.

04:12.783 --> 04:14.955
THAT'S NOT GEORGE.

04:17.488 --> 04:21.992
LOOK... LOOK AT HIS FEET.
LOOK HOW TALL HE IS.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.535
THAT'S NOT GEORGE.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.980
HE WROTE IN MY HAND.
(all talking at once)

04:39.980 --> 04:42.353
(Mark) WITH A PEN?
(Richard) WHAT DID HE DO?

04:42.353 --> 04:45.516
(Cristina) IN YOUR HAND?
WHAT DOES THAT--
NO, HE GRABBED MY HAND
AND HE SQUEEZED IT,

04:45.516 --> 04:47.658
AND HE WROTE WITH HIS FINGER.
HE WROTE WITH HIS FINGER?

04:47.658 --> 04:50.761
YOU KNOW, IN MY HAND.
HE WROTE "007."
WELL, GIVE...

04:50.761 --> 04:53.394
(Derek)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.496
OKAY, WHAT DID I WRITE?

04:55.496 --> 04:56.997
JOE?

04:56.997 --> 04:59.470
N-NO! NO,
I DID NOT WRITE "JOE."

04:59.470 --> 05:01.802
ARE--ARE YOU SERIOUS?
GREY, DO YOU MEAN
THIS MAY NOT BE O'MALLEY?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.034
THIS IS FUNNY.
(Richard) DID ANYONE TRY
AND CALL O'MALLEY?

05:04.034 --> 05:06.877
CAN WE GET HIM ON THE PHONE?
(cell phones beeping)

05:06.877 --> 05:09.880
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE SQUEEZED MY HAND.
JUST SH-SHUT IT.
YOU DON'T GET TO TALK ANYMORE.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.883
YOU DON'T GET TO TALK
EVER AGAIN.
I COULD'VE SWORN
IT WAS GEORGE.

05:12.883 --> 05:14.885
I GOT VOICE MAIL.
HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

05:14.885 --> 05:16.787
HE HAS A FRECKLE
ON HIS RIGHT HAND.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.650
IT'S SHAPED LIKE TEXAS.
I USED TO TEASE HIM ABOUT IT.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.051
I'LL CHECK.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.986
(Richard sighs)

05:55.986 --> 05:59.830
(pager beeps)

05:59.830 --> 06:03.794
(second pager beeps)

06:03.794 --> 06:06.397
YOU PEOPLE,
ANSWER YOUR PAGES.

06:06.397 --> 06:07.938
(pager beeps)

06:07.938 --> 06:09.940
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:09.940 --> 06:13.674
GEORGE O'MALLEY JUMPED
IN FRONT OF A BUS TODAY.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.077
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING,
AND HE DID IT ANYWAY,

06:17.077 --> 06:19.109
AND HE DID IT
TO SAVE A LIFE.

06:19.109 --> 06:22.713
SO I'M NOT GONNA ALLOW
YOU DOCTORS TO STAND HERE.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.715
THERE ARE LIVES ON THE LINE.

06:24.715 --> 06:26.717
THERE ARE LIVES WE CAN SAVE.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.720
SO IF GEORGE O'MALLEY CAN JUMP
IN FRONT OF A BUS,

06:29.720 --> 06:33.924
WE CAN ANSWER OUR DAMN PAGES.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.696
SO LET'S GO.

06:52.182 --> 06:54.545
(Richard) DAMN IT.

06:54.545 --> 06:56.617
DAMN IT, O'MALLEY.

07:01.452 --> 07:03.954
(interns crying)
NOW HOW LONG AGO
DID THE PAIN START?

07:03.954 --> 07:05.956
I DON'T KNOW.
A-A FEW WEEKS?

07:05.956 --> 07:08.899
GROWING PAINS. I TOOK HIM
TO SEE OUR DOCTOR.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.461
HE'S A BAD DOCTOR.

07:10.461 --> 07:12.503
HE'S--HE STANDS THERE TEXTING
WHILE I'M TALKING TO HIM.

07:12.503 --> 07:14.565
HE DIAGNOSED ANDY
WITH GROWING PAINS.

07:14.565 --> 07:16.567
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GREW UP,

07:16.567 --> 07:19.510
AND GROWING PAINS
DID NOT CAUSE ME TO FALL DOWN

07:19.510 --> 07:22.012
ON THE SOCCER FIELD.
MOM, YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE DRAMATIC.

07:22.012 --> 07:24.214
YOUR PAIN IS DRAMATIC
TO ME, ANDY.
YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.

07:24.214 --> 07:26.216
IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT YOU CAME.

07:26.216 --> 07:29.620
OKAY, THANKS,
BECAUSE IT DOES HURT.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.622
EVERYTHING HURTS,
ALL THE TIME.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.124
OKAY. WELL, I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAM,

07:34.124 --> 07:37.057
AND YOU'RE GONNA LET ME KNOW
IF THE PAIN GETS WORSE, OKAY?
(nurses crying)

07:37.057 --> 07:39.960
(woman crying) I KNOW.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.932
THIS DOESN'T FEEL REAL.

07:41.932 --> 07:43.934
DOES THIS FEEL REAL
TO YOU?

07:43.934 --> 07:45.896
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.501
OH, CRAP.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.843
I DON'T WANT... (exhales)
I CAN'T--

07:52.843 --> 07:56.076
MNH-MNH. DON'T WALK AWAY NOW.
COME ON.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.148
DON'T WALK... MM.

07:58.148 --> 08:01.852
MRS. O'MALLEY...
I'M SO SORRY.

08:01.852 --> 08:03.514
(voice breaking)
YOU WERE HIS WIFE.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.156
IN GOD'S EYES,
YOU'RE STILL HIS WIFE.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.058
YOU SHOULD DECIDE
ABOUT HIS ORGANS.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.090
YOU SHOULD DECIDE.
BUT, UM--

08:10.090 --> 08:11.762
I CAN'T DO IT, CALLIE.

08:11.762 --> 08:14.725
I CAN'T DO IT.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

08:14.725 --> 08:16.997
RONNIE AND--AND JERRY,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.670
THEY'RE OFF ON SOME
FISHING EXPEDITION IN ALASKA,

08:19.670 --> 08:21.672
AND THEY'RE GONNA COME HOME

08:21.672 --> 08:23.674
AND I HAVE TO TELL THEM
THAT GEORGIE...

08:23.674 --> 08:26.036
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.
THAT'S ALL I CAN...

08:26.036 --> 08:27.738
I CAN'T.

08:27.738 --> 08:31.211
I-I CAN'T... EVEN SEE HIM
LIKE THIS. I CAN'T.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.744
YOU NEED TO DO THIS
FOR ME.

08:33.744 --> 08:37.087
CAN YOU DO THIS FOR ME?

08:41.592 --> 08:45.055
(indistinct conversations)

08:45.055 --> 08:49.660
(siren wailing)

08:53.864 --> 08:55.866
SPEED BOAT ACCIDENT.
19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.869
LOST VITALS TWICE, BUT B.P.'s
HOLDING IN THE LOW 80s.

08:58.869 --> 09:01.211
BOTH ARMS AMPUTATED
AT THE SCENE,

09:01.211 --> 09:03.774
AND THE RIGHT LEG'S
HANGING ON BY A THREAD.
DID YOU RECOVER
EITHER OF THE ARMS?

09:03.774 --> 09:06.016
NO, THEY'RE PROBABLY
AT THE BOTTOM OF PUGET SOUND.

09:06.016 --> 09:09.149
SHE WAS THROWN FROM THE BOAT,
GOT PULLED INTO THE PROPELLER.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.081
SHE NEEDS MORE ACCESS.
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.

09:11.081 --> 09:13.323
LET'S GET A CENTRAL LINE
IN HER. LET'S GO. GO.

09:13.323 --> 09:15.756
(Cristina) DRAW TRAUMA LABS,
UH, TYPE AND CROSS HER

09:15.756 --> 09:18.088
AND GET AS MUCH O-NEG
AS POSSIBLE.
WAIT! I FOUND THEM.
I FOUND THEM. HER ARMS!

09:18.088 --> 09:20.791
(man) THEY WERE ON THE BOAT
WITH HER.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.734
I FOUND THEM IN THE WATER.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM.

09:23.734 --> 09:26.196
THEY WERE JUST FLOATING
IN THE WATER.

09:26.196 --> 09:29.569
YOU--YOU CAN SEW THEM
BACK ON, RIGHT?
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.942
OH, MY GOD, JOJO.
THAT WAS SO GROSS.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.104
JASMINE, YOU JUST
SAVED HER LIFE.

09:34.104 --> 09:36.246
YOU THINK?

09:38.308 --> 09:40.280
I'M SO SORRY.
I JUST HEARD.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.282
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.855
GO HOME.
YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

09:44.855 --> 09:48.218
YOU NEED TO CRY
AND SCREAM AND--

09:48.218 --> 09:51.161
WHEN MY BROTHER DIED,
I-I ATE DOUGHNUTS.

09:51.161 --> 09:55.065
I ATE A LOT OF DOUGHNUTS,
AND THAT HELPED SOME BUT...

09:55.065 --> 09:59.199
GOD, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
HIS MOM WANTS ME TO DECIDE
ABOUT HIS ORGANS.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.971
HE LOST HIS WALLET
IN THE ACCIDENT.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.873
THEY DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S A DONOR,

10:02.873 --> 10:06.006
AND NOW HIS MOM WANTS ME
TO DECIDE, AND I CAN'T.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.008
I CAN'T TELL HER NO,
BUT I CAN'T DECIDE.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.711
I MEAN, WE WERE ONLY MARRIED
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.213
OKAY, BUT...
DURING THOSE MONTHS,

10:13.213 --> 10:16.647
YOU WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN GEORGE'S LIFE.

10:16.647 --> 10:20.020
NO.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.123
NO, I WASN'T.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.195
I...

10:25.195 --> 10:26.927
I'M SORRY.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.929
OKAY, SO LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT THE X-RAYS.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.032
DO I NEED TO TAKE MY SON
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL?
WHAT?

10:32.032 --> 10:34.034
THAT DOCTOR'S HANDS ARE SHAKING

10:34.034 --> 10:36.837
AS HE TRIES TO STICK MY SON
WITH A NEEDLE,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.308
AND THOSE NURSES ARE CRYING.

10:38.308 --> 10:41.311
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND--
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

10:41.311 --> 10:44.745
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT,
AND ONE OF OUR PEOPLE DIED.
(Steve sniffles)

10:48.148 --> 10:51.221
ANDY IS MY PERSON.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.053
HE'S MY ONLY PERSON.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.126
AND... SOMETHING
IS WRONG WITH HIM.

10:56.126 --> 10:58.128
SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS,

10:58.128 --> 11:00.330
DO I NEED TO TAKE HIM
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

11:00.330 --> 11:02.192
NO.

11:02.192 --> 11:04.935
NO.

11:04.935 --> 11:08.298
I'LL MAKE ANDY MY PERSON,
OKAY?

11:08.298 --> 11:10.741
I'LL MAKE ANDY
MY PERSON, TOO.

11:13.143 --> 11:15.776
(Alex) I DIDN'T TELL HER,
OKAY?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.308
KAREV--
LOOK, WE JUST IGNORED
HER D.N.R.

11:18.308 --> 11:21.211
HER KIDNEYS QUIT
AND SHE CODED.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.783
SHE WAS FREAKING INTUBATED.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.216
SHE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
WHAT'S HER B.U.N.?

11:26.216 --> 11:28.158
15.
AND HER CREATININE?

11:28.158 --> 11:30.360
1.5.
SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.063
SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH,
AND YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.
WHY? IT CAN WAIT.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.195
NO, IT CAN'T. IT CAN'T WAIT
BECAUSE GEORGE'S ORGANS

11:35.195 --> 11:37.197
ARE NOT GONNA BE VIABLE
FOR LONG.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.900
IF THEY WANT TO USE 'EM,
THEY HAVE TO DO IT SOON,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.902
AND I HAVE TO DECIDE
IF THEY GET TO USE 'EM,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.904
AND I NEED IZZIE TO HELP ME,

11:43.904 --> 11:45.906

WHO SHOULD DECIDE.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.377
SHE'S WHO SHOULD DECIDE.

11:47.377 --> 11:50.781
SO THAT'S ONE REASON AND...
AND THE OTHER REASON IS, KAREV,

11:50.781 --> 11:52.783
IF YOU LET THEM
UNPLUG GEORGE

11:52.783 --> 11:55.115
WITHOUT GIVING HER A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE...

11:55.115 --> 11:57.117
I MEAN IT,
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.249
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.

12:03.153 --> 12:05.425
(monitor beeping erratically)
HER PRESSURE KEEPS DROPPING.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.059

12:09.059 --> 12:10.831

12:10.831 --> 12:13.233

YAY! I FOUND 'EM,
YOU KNOW?

12:13.233 --> 12:16.837
(drill whirs)
I'M LOOKING AT OMENTUM.
LET'S GET HER TO AN O.R. NOW.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.069
DOES YOUR FRIEND HAVE ANY
ALLERGIES, MEDICAL CONDITIONS?

12:19.069 --> 12:21.842
IS SHE ON ANY MEDICATION?
SHE'S NOT OUR FRIEND.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.144
JASMINE!
WE BARELY KNOW HER. WE MET HER
ON THE PLANE FROM SYDNEY.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.077
WE'RE BACKPACKING,
SEEING THE STATES.
SO WE HARDLY KNOW HER.
WE'RE JUST TRAVELING MATES.

12:27.077 --> 12:30.120

(Owen) ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.182

22:43.933 --> 22:46.996
YOU WANT ME TO QUIT THERAPY?
HMM?
NO!

22:46.996 --> 22:49.399
MM-HMM.
CRAP.

22:49.399 --> 22:53.372
ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO GO
TO O'MALLEY'S FUNERAL ANYWAY.
NO, I HATE FUNERALS.
LET'S SKIP IT.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.945
UH, WE CAN, UH, PUSH UP
CEVICHE'S DEBRIDEMENT.

22:55.945 --> 22:57.477
THAT'S A GOOD EXCUSE.
CEVICHE?

22:57.477 --> 23:00.450
CHOPPED UP FISH.
PROPELLER ACCIDENT.

23:00.450 --> 23:01.981
CEVICHE. IT'S FUNNY.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.654
RIGHT. IT'S SICK.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY.

23:04.654 --> 23:06.686
WE ARE GOING TO THE FUNERAL.
COME ON.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.688
"AND THEN ALL THESE
UNICYCLE BOYS WITH WINGS

23:08.688 --> 23:11.160
"CARRIED US ON A PLATFORM LIKE
WE WERE CLEOPATRA OR SOMETHING.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.862
HILARIOUS."

23:12.862 --> 23:16.496
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WENT
TO BURNING MAN. HAGS.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.698
THEY'D NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF BURNING MAN.

23:22.171 --> 23:24.634
I HATE THEM.

23:24.634 --> 23:27.006
I HATE THEM.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.978
CLARA...

23:28.978 --> 23:30.640
FORGET THEM.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.141
OKAY? THEY'RE MORONS.

23:32.141 --> 23:35.715
THEY'RE JUST...
THINK ABOUT TODAY.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.687
OKAY, THE FACT THAT TODAY,
YOU'RE GONNA GET

23:37.687 --> 23:39.689
WHAT WE BELIEVE
IS YOUR FINAL DEBRIDEMENT,

23:39.689 --> 23:41.691
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
WE'RE GONNA GET

23:41.691 --> 23:44.023
THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST IN HERE
TO GET YOUR ARM MOVING.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.896
SO I AM GONNA SAVE THIS PIECE
FOR YOU TO DO.

23:46.896 --> 23:48.197
THANKS.

23:48.197 --> 23:51.200
NOW I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.432
NO.
DON'T YOU WANT TO CALL
YOUR MOM...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.465
NO.
BEFORE YOUR NEXT SURGERY?

23:55.465 --> 23:58.468
NO. NOT YET.

23:58.468 --> 24:00.470
BUT WE COULD WRITE HER
ANOTHER E-MAIL.

24:00.470 --> 24:02.912
WILL IT MAKE YOU LATE
FOR YOUR FUNERAL?

24:02.912 --> 24:04.714
NO, NO.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.449
HI, MUM.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.652
I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.655
ASIDE FROM THE HEAT
AND THE SMELL,

24:15.655 --> 24:17.857
BURNING MAN WAS AMAZING.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.033
(man) THERE IS AN APPOINTED TIME
FOR EVERYTHING,

24:24.033 --> 24:27.867
AND A TIME FOR EVERY AFFAIR
UNDER THE HEAVENS...

24:27.867 --> 24:31.170
(sobbing)
A TIME TO BE BORN
AND A TIME TO DIE,

24:31.170 --> 24:34.003
A TIME TO PLANT

24:34.003 --> 24:38.077
AND A TIME TO UPROOT
THE PLANT,

24:38.077 --> 24:41.150
A TIME TO KILL
AND A TIME TO HEAL...
(sobbing continues)

24:41.150 --> 24:44.514
A TIME TO TEAR DOWN
AND A TIME TO BUILD...

24:44.514 --> 24:46.756
ARE YOU OKAY?
A TIME TO WEEP...

24:46.756 --> 24:50.019
YOU WANT THE WHEELCHAIR?
AND A TIME TO LAUGH,

24:50.019 --> 24:53.162
A TIME TO MOURN
AND A TIME TO DANCE,

24:53.162 --> 24:54.924
A TIME TO CAST AWAY STONES

24:54.924 --> 24:58.828
AND A TIME
TO GATHER STONES TOGETHER,

24:58.828 --> 25:01.571
A TIME TO EMBRACE,

25:01.571 --> 25:03.933
AND A TIME TO REFRAIN
FROM EMBRACING.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.182
(laughing) I'M SORRY.

25:13.182 --> 25:15.184
YOU'RE LAUGHING?

25:15.184 --> 25:18.287
SHE'S LAUGHING.
(laughing continues)

25:18.287 --> 25:21.520
GEORGE--GEORGE IS DEAD.
HE'S DEAD.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.522
THEY'RE ABOUT TO PUT HIM
IN THE GROUND,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.825
AND THE PRIEST IS DOING
CLASSIC ROCK LYRICS.

25:25.825 --> 25:29.058
AND THAT GIRL, THAT REDHEAD IS
CRYING HARDER THAN HIS MOTHER,

25:29.058 --> 25:31.060
AND SHE NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

25:31.060 --> 25:33.863
IT'S JUST...
YOU ARE FAR MORE TWISTED
THAN I EVER REALIZED.

25:33.863 --> 25:35.865
(laughing continues)
AND YOU GOT MARRIED

25:35.865 --> 25:37.737
ON A POST-IT.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.710
(all laughing)

25:40.710 --> 25:43.212
I GOT MARRIED ON A POST-IT.
I DID. I DID.

25:43.212 --> 25:46.215
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
GOT MARRIED FOR REAL?
I KNOW!

25:46.215 --> 25:49.148
(all laughing harder)

25:49.148 --> 25:52.321
AND I GOT CANCER.
WHAT?

25:52.321 --> 25:56.255
DUDE, O-O'MALLEY
GOT HIT BY A BUS.

25:56.255 --> 25:59.629
(all laughing harder)

25:59.629 --> 26:01.861
(Izzie) OH, MY GOD.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.193
(laughs and speaks
indistinctly)

26:04.193 --> 26:08.267
(laughing begins to fade)

26:08.267 --> 26:10.770
(mourners speaking indistinctly)

26:10.770 --> 26:12.872
(sobs)

26:12.872 --> 26:16.205
(all laughing)

26:21.681 --> 26:24.183
SHE NEVER STOPS CRYING.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.786
(laughing continues)

26:26.786 --> 26:29.789
(laughing fades)

26:51.641 --> 26:53.643
NOT NOW.
PLEASE NOT NOW.

26:53.643 --> 26:55.945
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME.

26:55.945 --> 26:57.717
NOT NOW.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.990
I AM BUYING YOU TIME, YOU KNOW?
I AM BUYING YOU TIME.

27:00.990 --> 27:02.992
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE GIVEN.

27:02.992 --> 27:05.895
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I HAVE SACRIFICED.

27:05.895 --> 27:09.028
FOR EVERY MISCALCULATION
YOU THINK YOU SEE,

27:09.028 --> 27:12.001
THERE HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED THINGS
THAT I HAVE GOTTEN RIGHT,

27:12.001 --> 27:14.003
AND NO ONE KNOWS.

27:14.003 --> 27:17.036
LOOK, I'M ON YOUR SIDE,
OKAY?

27:17.036 --> 27:19.338
I'M--I'M NOT THE BOARD.
I'M NOT JENNINGS.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.210
WELL, THEN BACK OFF, THEN.

27:21.210 --> 27:25.344
JUST BACK OFF AND...
YOU GIVE ME TIME TO THINK.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.177
LET ME HAVE A MINUTE TO...

27:28.177 --> 27:31.120
O'MALLEY WAS MY INTERN.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.725
AND I AM TRYING TO JUST
TAKE A MINUTE.

27:35.725 --> 27:38.387
SO, DEREK, PLEASE...

27:38.387 --> 27:42.161
BACK OFF.

27:51.140 --> 27:54.143
(indistinct conversations)

28:10.259 --> 28:12.762
YOU WANT A RIDE HOME?

28:12.762 --> 28:15.164
I WAS GONNA
CLEAN OUT HIS LOCKER,

28:15.164 --> 28:19.368
GIVE HIS STUFF
TO HIS MOM, BUT...

28:19.368 --> 28:21.771
I WAS A BAD FRIEND

28:21.771 --> 28:23.402
TO GEORGE.

28:23.402 --> 28:26.275
I WAS ABOUT
AS GOOD A FRIEND TO HIM

28:26.275 --> 28:28.407
AS CLARA'S FRIENDS,
WHO KEEP SENDING POSTCARDS

28:28.407 --> 28:31.280
FROM THE TRIP
THAT SHE'LL NEVER GET TO TAKE.

28:31.280 --> 28:35.314
I JUST... I...
I ABANDONED HIM COMPLETELY.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.446
I-I-I JUST... MOVED OUT

28:37.446 --> 28:41.350
AND--AND STOPPED TALKING
TO HIM AND... WHY?

28:41.350 --> 28:44.323
BECAUSE--BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
THINK I WAS AS HOT

28:44.323 --> 28:45.895
AS I THOUGHT HE WAS

28:45.895 --> 28:48.828
OR BE-BECAUSE HE--HE DIDN'T--
HE DIDN'T LOVE ME BACK?

28:51.300 --> 28:54.263
THIS... MAY BE
BAD TIMING,

28:54.263 --> 28:57.236
BUT I GOTTA ASK.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.769
WHAT DID THAT GUY HAVE?

28:59.769 --> 29:02.271
I MEAN, HE WASN'T MUCH
TO LOOK AT.

29:02.271 --> 29:07.817
BUT YOU AND STEVENS
AND TORRES?

29:07.817 --> 29:09.418
TELL THE TRUTH.

29:09.418 --> 29:12.822
WAS HE... YOU KNOW...

29:12.822 --> 29:14.353
HUNG?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.258
THAT'S--

29:19.258 --> 29:22.531
I KNOW. I SAID BAD TIMING.
I--

29:22.531 --> 29:25.764
BUT SERIOUSLY, HE WAS KIND OF
A DORKY LITTLE DUDE.
STOP. STOP TALKING.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.266
SORRY. SORRY. SORRY.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.199
(laughs) HE... HE DIED.

29:30.199 --> 29:32.341
I...

29:32.341 --> 29:36.045
(voice breaks) GEORGE DIED.

29:36.045 --> 29:38.908
YEAH.

29:42.351 --> 29:45.354
(crying)

29:57.226 --> 29:59.268
OKAY, ANY PAIN HERE?

29:59.268 --> 30:01.370
NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

30:01.370 --> 30:03.372
ANY DIZZINESS
WHEN YOU STOOD UP?

30:03.372 --> 30:05.074
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

30:05.074 --> 30:06.805
(inhales) NO.
(exhales)

30:06.805 --> 30:08.007
OKAY.

30:08.007 --> 30:11.040
YOU ARE GOING HOME.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.282
YOU ARE GONNA COME BACK
IN 12 DAYS

30:13.282 --> 30:16.515
FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF I.L.-2,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.518
AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR PET-SCAN
TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.022
BUT THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU
TO KEEP LIVING IN THIS BED.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.054
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT EASY.

30:25.054 --> 30:27.126
YOU'RE STILL
A CANCER PATIENT,

30:27.126 --> 30:30.359
BUT YOU'RE NO LONGER
A SURGICAL PATIENT.

30:33.002 --> 30:35.564
THANK YOU, DR. BAILEY.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.411
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO...

30:42.411 --> 30:43.913
THANK YOU.

30:43.913 --> 30:45.444
MM-HMM.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.147
UH, DON'T FORGET TO SIGN
THE DISCHARGE PAPERS

30:48.147 --> 30:50.149
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.323
ANDY?

30:54.323 --> 30:56.625
HE'S GOT SERIOUS PAIN
IN HIS INGUINAL AREA

30:56.625 --> 30:58.627
AND DOWN HIS LEGS
AND IN HIS LOWER BACK.

30:58.627 --> 31:00.890
HE'S GOT A TEMP OF 101,

31:00.890 --> 31:03.392
AND HIS MOM SAYS HE'S BEEN
THROWING UP ALL NIGHT.

31:03.392 --> 31:07.166
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THIS
IS GROWING PAINS, DR. ROBBINS.

31:15.204 --> 31:16.575
(exhales deeply)

31:16.575 --> 31:18.477
I CAN'T DO IT.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.479
IT'S OKAY.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.482
I CAN'T MOVE IT AT ALL.
(Owen) IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS
SINCE YOUR LAST SURGERY.

31:23.482 --> 31:27.016
THE SWELLING WILL COME DOWN.
WE'LL JUST KEEP TRYING.

31:27.016 --> 31:29.458
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
RIGHT. GREAT.

31:29.458 --> 31:32.521
SO... WHERE DID WE
LEAVE OFF,

31:32.521 --> 31:34.223
AT THE GRAND CANYON?

31:34.223 --> 31:35.464
YEAH.

31:35.464 --> 31:37.927
BIG, GORGEOUS HOLE
IN THE GROUND.

31:37.927 --> 31:41.200
OKAY, UH, MISS YOU, MUM.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.202
(clicks keyboard keys)
UH, WISH YOU COULD
SEE IT.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.633
CLARA, SORRY. UM...

31:44.633 --> 31:47.606
YOU ARE DOING GREAT,
BUT YOU GOT A LONG ROAD HERE.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.980
AND BELIEVE ME, YOUR MOM,
SHE'S GONNA WANT TO KNOW.

31:50.980 --> 31:53.412
AND SHE'S GONNA WANT TO HELP.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.318
SHE MADE ME FROM SCRATCH.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.691
THAT'S WHAT
SHE ALWAYS SAYS.

32:02.691 --> 32:08.257
LIKE... WHEN I WANTED
TO GO SKYDIVING, YOU KNOW?

32:08.257 --> 32:10.259
"DON'T JUMP OUT OF
A PLANE, CLARA.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.701
I MADE THAT BODY
FROM SCRATCH."

32:12.701 --> 32:16.405
OR WHEN I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE...

32:16.405 --> 32:20.709
"BE MORE CAREFUL, DARLING.
I MADE THAT ANKLE FROM SCRATCH."

32:24.173 --> 32:27.346
MISS YOU, MUM.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.418
I'M DOING GREAT.

32:29.418 --> 32:32.421
(keyboard keys clicking)

32:32.421 --> 32:36.425
LOVE YOU. CLARA.

32:36.425 --> 32:39.428
(clicking keyboard keys)

32:46.335 --> 32:48.367
(exhales deeply)

32:48.367 --> 32:50.069
(Richard) COME IN.

32:52.401 --> 32:55.244
OH, DR. TORRES.

32:55.244 --> 32:59.148
CHIEF, I WAS JUST, UM...

32:59.148 --> 33:00.509
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

33:00.509 --> 33:02.511
I, UM, HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING

33:02.511 --> 33:07.686
ABOUT MY APPLICATION
FOR ATTENDING, SO...

33:07.686 --> 33:10.489
WELL, DR. TORRES, DR. CHANG'S
401(k) TOOK A HIT,

33:10.489 --> 33:13.492
AND HE'S PUTTING OFF RETIREMENT
FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO.

33:13.492 --> 33:17.496
SO... SO WAIT.
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THE JOB?

33:17.496 --> 33:20.369
THERE IS NO JOB,
NOT THIS YEAR.

33:20.369 --> 33:23.332
I'M SORRY.
I ASSUMED YOU'D HEARD.

33:24.733 --> 33:27.506
OKAY, UM, DR. CHANG
IS BASICALLY A FIGUREHEAD.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.438
YOU'RE CLEAR ON THAT,
RIGHT?

33:29.438 --> 33:31.510
WHEN PEOPLE WANT THE BEST,
THEY PAGE ME.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.214
I HAVE BASICALLY BEEN RUNNING
DR. CHANG'S DEPARTMENT ALL YEAR.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.486
DR. CHANG HAS
AN IMPECCABLE RECORD.
HE IS A DINOSAUR!

33:37.486 --> 33:39.418
AND SO AM I!

33:41.390 --> 33:43.722
YOU'RE... (scoffs)

33:43.722 --> 33:45.724
THIS IS C--

33:45.724 --> 33:48.497
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.

33:48.497 --> 33:50.529
DR. TORRES--

33:50.529 --> 33:52.701
NO, NO, NO.
I AM JUST... (chuckles)

33:52.701 --> 33:54.703
NO. I AM EXCELLENT.

33:54.703 --> 33:56.405
I AM EXCELLENT,

33:56.405 --> 33:59.108
AND ANY OTHER HOSPITAL
WOULD BE THRILLED TO HAVE ME.

33:59.108 --> 34:01.340
I'M FLATTERED FOR THE OFFER,
LARRY,

34:01.340 --> 34:03.512
AND I'M SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING IT, BUT IT'S--

34:03.512 --> 34:06.245
IT'S COMPLICATED,
AND I NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.617
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
MORE TIME, DEREK.

34:08.617 --> 34:11.180
I CAN GIVE YOU MORE MONEY,
BETTER BENEFITS

34:11.180 --> 34:14.483
AND A WHOLE LOT OF PRESS--
THAT'S WHAT I CAN GIVE YOU.

34:14.483 --> 34:16.755
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU
MUCH MORE TIME.
YES, I AM.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.388
I'M A SUPERSTAR--
A SUPERSTAR WITH A SCALPEL.
TORRES--

34:19.388 --> 34:21.390
NO! DON'T SAY MY NAME.
DO NOT.

34:21.390 --> 34:24.693
I AM TOO BIG A STAR
FOR YOU TO SAY MY NAME.

34:24.693 --> 34:27.436
I BUILD ARMS OUT OF NOTHING,
AND LEGS, LIKE GOD.

34:27.436 --> 34:30.239
AND WHEN I WIN THE HARPER AVERY
AND EVERY OTHER PRIZE THERE IS,

34:30.239 --> 34:32.401
YOU WILL RUE THIS DAY,
CHIEF WEBBER.

34:32.401 --> 34:34.573
THAT'S RIGHT. I SAID "RUE."

34:36.675 --> 34:39.648
TIGHT SHIP YOU'RE RUNNING
HERE, WEBBER.

34:39.648 --> 34:42.080
REAL TIGHT SHIP.

34:44.283 --> 34:47.156
(elevator bell dings)

34:56.395 --> 35:00.469
(crying)

35:05.474 --> 35:09.508
(crying continues)

35:21.690 --> 35:23.392
AMANDA.

35:23.392 --> 35:24.553
HI.

35:24.553 --> 35:26.555
HI. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

35:26.555 --> 35:29.528
UH, I...

35:29.528 --> 35:31.630
CAN'T SLEEP.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.733
I CAN'T... FALL ASLEEP

35:34.733 --> 35:39.708
'CAUSE I SEE HIS FACE
ALL THE TIME.

35:39.708 --> 35:42.811
I SEE HIM
AT THE BUS STOP...

35:42.811 --> 35:45.574
YOU KNOW, SWEET, SMILING,

35:45.574 --> 35:47.546
AND THEN...

35:47.546 --> 35:50.549
AND THEN I SEE THE WAY
THAT HE ENDED UP,

35:50.549 --> 35:52.851
SO THAT EVEN HIS BEST FRIENDS
CAN'T RECOGNIZE HIM,

35:52.851 --> 35:54.423
AND I CAN'T SLEEP.

35:54.423 --> 35:57.826
CAN YOU... CAN YOU SLEEP?

35:57.826 --> 36:00.659
I, UM...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.332
AM GONNA WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION

36:03.332 --> 36:05.864
FOR AN ANTIANXIETY
MEDICATION.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.866
AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT,

36:07.866 --> 36:09.868
BECAUSE THIS
SLEEP DEPRIVATION THING

36:09.868 --> 36:11.840
CAN BE QUITE HARMFUL.

36:18.447 --> 36:19.748
DR. ROBBINS.

36:19.748 --> 36:21.280
CHIEF.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.782
DID YOU ORDER AN EMERGENT
3-D M.R.I. FOR THIS PATIENT?

36:23.782 --> 36:25.784
OKAY, YOU'RE MAD.
I SEE THAT.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.517
BUT WITH THE PATIENT'S
MOTHER'S INSURANCE,

36:28.517 --> 36:30.819
IT COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO GET AN M.R.I.

36:30.819 --> 36:33.622
AND A SPECIALTY PAIN REFERRAL--
SO YOU EXPECT THE HOSPITAL
TO PAY FOR THIS

36:33.622 --> 36:35.894
WITH WHOSE MONEY?
OH, WELL, SIR,
I ONLY THOUGHT THAT--

36:35.894 --> 36:38.927
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,
DR. ROBBINS.

36:38.927 --> 36:42.200
NOW DISCHARGE YOUR PATIENT,
REFER HIM BACK TO HIS PHYSICIAN,

36:42.200 --> 36:44.202
AND DO IT NOW.

36:46.275 --> 36:47.576
(clicks button)

36:47.576 --> 36:50.439
DR. KAREV,
CHANGE OF PLANS.

36:50.439 --> 36:51.780
(click)

36:54.513 --> 36:56.214
(banging on door)

36:56.214 --> 36:58.347
OPEN UP!

36:59.718 --> 37:03.652
OPEN THE DOOR, TORRES.

37:03.652 --> 37:05.754
OPEN THE DOOR
OR I'LL KEEP KNOCKING

37:05.754 --> 37:09.958
AND POTENTIALLY DAMAGE
MY MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR HANDS.

37:09.958 --> 37:13.532
(crying) MY EX-HUSBAND DIED.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.835
HE DIED. HE ACTUALLY
GOT HIT BY A BUS.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.837
GEORGE GOT HIT BY A BUS.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.239
AND NOW--NOW I HAVE TO GET
A NEW JOB,

37:21.239 --> 37:23.472
AND--AND I'M NEVER GONNA SEE
MY FRIENDS ANYMORE.

37:23.472 --> 37:28.447
AND ARIZONA KEEPS BRINGING ME
DOUGHNUTS.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.450
(sobbing)

37:31.450 --> 37:33.452
(man) WE'LL SET UP
THE SCAFFOLDING HERE.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.923
(men speaking indistinctly)

37:34.923 --> 37:37.626
THIS PLACE FOR SALE?
IT'S NICE.

37:37.626 --> 37:38.927
(sniffles)

37:38.927 --> 37:40.629

37:40.629 --> 37:43.692
OH, NOTHING, NOTHING.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.840

37:51.840 --> 37:53.502

37:53.502 --> 37:55.874

DOESN'T THAT HURT?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.006
(Meredith) LEAVE US ALONE.
WE'RE NEWLYWEDS!

37:58.006 --> 38:00.649
A POST-IT WEDDING
DOES NOT MAKE YOU NEWLYWEDS.

38:00.649 --> 38:03.482
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE NEWLYWEDS, TOO.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.814
YOU NEED YOUR OWN SPACE.
HEY, DUDE, WHAT ARE THESE?

38:05.814 --> 38:09.057
THE KEYS TO MY TRAILER--
YOUR NEW HOME.

38:09.057 --> 38:11.019

38:15.464 --> 38:16.765

38:16.765 --> 38:17.896
YES.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.829
I'M LOUISE O'MALLEY.
GEORGE'S MOTHER.

38:20.829 --> 38:23.372
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY. I-I DIDN'T...

38:23.372 --> 38:25.374
I'M SORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:25.374 --> 38:27.576
I'M... I--WELL, I HOPE
YOU DON'T, UH, MIND

ME COMING HERE TO SEE YOU.

38:29.578 --> 38:32.511
I KNOW YOU SURGEONS
ARE--ARE VERY BUSY PEOPLE.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.784
MY GEORGIE
WAS ALWAYS SAYING--
IT'S NO PROBLEM. IT'S FINE.

38:35.784 --> 38:39.548
I'M... HAVING TROUBLE.

38:39.548 --> 38:43.422
I'M HAVING TROUBLE...

38:44.693 --> 38:46.925

38:46.925 --> 38:48.927

IT'S BECAUSE

38:48.927 --> 38:51.560
I--I'M HAVING TROUBLE

38:51.560 --> 38:53.562
UH, THERE'S A PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE MISSING.

38:53.562 --> 38:57.536
I-I DO BETTER WHEN I UNDERSTAND
THINGS, HOW THINGS HAPPEN.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.908
AND GEORGE...

38:59.908 --> 39:02.070
MY GEORGE...

39:02.070 --> 39:05.073
THE BOY I KNEW,
THE BOY I RAISED, MY BOY

39:05.073 --> 39:07.516
WOULD NEVER HAVE JOINED
THE ARMY.

39:07.516 --> 39:10.579
SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

39:10.579 --> 39:13.552
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
THAT PIECE OF IT.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.586
I--I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY
GEORGIE WASN'T AT WORK THAT DAY,

39:17.586 --> 39:20.589
WHY HE WAS ON HIS WAY
TO MY HOUSE TO TELL ME

39:20.589 --> 39:25.664
HE'D JOINED THE ARMY
IN WARTIME.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.697
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:28.697 --> 39:32.370
AND DR. WEBBER SAID
I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.543
(sighs)

39:34.543 --> 39:37.546
MRS. O'MALLEY, I DIDN'T
KNOW HIM LIKE YOU KNEW HIM.

39:37.546 --> 39:38.977
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM LONG,

39:38.977 --> 39:41.980
BUT HE HAD TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
AS A TRAUMA SURGEON.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.483
HE... HE WAS VERY FAST
ON HIS FEET,

39:44.483 --> 39:46.485
AND HE COULD THINK
AND ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY

39:46.485 --> 39:48.487
UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.519
HE HAD TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.

39:50.519 --> 39:52.961
AND... (sighs)

39:52.961 --> 39:54.963
YOU KNOW, HE WAS IMPATIENT.

39:54.963 --> 39:56.995
HE WANTED
TO BECOME BETTER FASTER.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.698
HE WANTED TO SAVE
MORE LIVES.

39:59.698 --> 40:03.932
HE WAS GOOD.

40:03.932 --> 40:07.736
AND HE WAS THOUGHTFUL
AND GENEROUS.

40:07.736 --> 40:10.739
AND I THINK IN THE END,
I THINK...

40:10.739 --> 40:13.542
I THINK HE WAS
HEROIC AND NOBLE.

40:13.542 --> 40:16.485
AND I LIKED HIM VERY MUCH.

40:16.485 --> 40:18.487
AND I THINK HE GAVE YOU
GOOD REASON

40:18.487 --> 40:22.551
