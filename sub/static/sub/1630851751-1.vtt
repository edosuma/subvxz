<i>Siphonophores clone themselves

15:48.949 --> 15:51.683
Some are digesting,
some are moving

15:51.685 --> 15:54.719

The way that creatures
like this feed

suck that soup out

23:06.219 --> 23:08.452
<i>in this isolated Indian village.</i>

23:09.154 --> 23:11.455
For two species
to successfully mate,

23:11.457 --> 23:15.126
they ideally have to have the
same number of chromosomes.

23:15.827 --> 23:16.861
<i>For example,</i>

23:16.863 --> 23:19.697
<i>dogs and wolves

23:21.367 --> 23:23.434
<i>[Harry] Crossbreeding
humans with other animals</i>

23:23.436 --> 23:25.236

23:36.782 --> 23:39.383
<i>Goats would be
even less of a match.</i>

23:39.385 --> 23:43.087
Goats have 60 chromosomes
and humans have 46.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.089
<i>The difference

<i>how the goat ended up

23:59.037 --> 24:00.805
The reason this goat
looks so strange

24:00.807 --> 24:03.808
is because
its eyes are forward-facing,

24:03.810 --> 24:05.643
kind of like
a predator's eyes would be.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.914
Goats are generally
prey animals,

24:09.916 --> 24:13.384
and so their eyes are on both
sides of their head to allow them

24:13.386 --> 24:15.853
<i>to view a lot of the ground
around them</i>

24:15.855 --> 24:18.522

24:18.524 --> 24:20.658
<i>[Harry] Bondar believes
the goat is suffering</i>

24:20.660 --> 24:22.593
<i>from a rare deformity.</i>

24:22.595 --> 24:26.931
<i>[Carin] Some mammals experience
a condition called holoprosencephaly,</i>

24:26.933 --> 24:31.268
where the two sides of the brain
fail to distinguish from each other,

24:31.270 --> 24:36.340
<i>and it results in the eyes
appearing far too close together.</i>

24:36.342 --> 24:38.442
[Harry]
<i>In extreme circumstances,</i>

24:38.444 --> 24:42.213
<i>this condition can result in a
single eye in the middle of the face,</i>

24:42.881 --> 24:44.415
<i>a Cyclops.</i>

24:44.950 --> 24:46.684
<i>Historians have speculated</i>

24:46.686 --> 24:49.353
<i>the legendary creature
of Greek mythology</i>

24:49.355 --> 24:52.656
<i>may have been inspired
by a similar deformity.</i>

24:53.792 --> 24:55.092
<i>But Ashanti Davis</i>

24:55.094 --> 24:57.261
<i>believes
the goat's freakish face</i>

24:57.263 --> 25:00.097
<i>is not just a random mutation.</i>

25:00.099 --> 25:01.765
So there are a number
of harmful substances

25:01.767 --> 25:03.100
called teratogens,

25:03.102 --> 25:07.805
and they actually impact the
development and growth of a fetus.

25:07.807 --> 25:11.308
[Harry] <i>Montanari studies the

25:11.310 --> 25:14.478

25:14.480 --> 25:19.116
<i>and discovers that India's
intensive farming could be to blame.</i>

25:19.118 --> 25:21.252
India has
a lot of mouths to feed.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.924
<i>It's the second most
populous country after China,</i>

25:26.926 --> 25:29.426
<i>and that puts
a lot of pressure on farming.</i>

25:29.428 --> 25:31.128
[distant rumble of machinery]

25:31.130 --> 25:34.331
<i>[Shaena] As a result, farmers
are overfertilizing their fields</i>

25:34.333 --> 25:37.101
to get maximum crop yields.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.304
<i>[Harry] India spreads 50
million tons of chemical fertilizer</i>

25:40.306 --> 25:42.439
<i>on its crops each year.</i>

25:42.441 --> 25:45.543
The excess nitrogen
washes into waterways

25:45.545 --> 25:48.979
and is consumed
by local communities.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.148
<i>[Harry] Nitrogen
and nitrate chemicals</i>

25:51.150 --> 25:53.150
<i>cause abnormal
fetal development,</i>

25:53.152 --> 25:54.752
<i>and in some areas,</i>

25:54.754 --> 25:59.924
<i>they're seeping into the water supply
in quantities far beyond safe limits.</i>

25:59.926 --> 26:02.359
It's likely
that excess nitrogen levels

26:02.361 --> 26:04.562
<i>caused the birth defect
in the goat.</i>

26:04.564 --> 26:07.197

the goat is exposed to,</i>

26:07.199 --> 26:09.133

26:09.135 --> 26:12.036
In order to try to feed
its population better,

26:12.038 --> 26:15.005
India could actually
be poisoning them as well.

his cockpit radar,</i>

34:12.017 --> 34:15.452
<i>but what he sees
just deepens the mystery.</i>

34:16.421 --> 34:18.055
<i>[George] It doesn't show up.</i>

34:18.057 --> 34:21.992
It's just a thing
that they go flying past.

34:23.494 --> 34:26.897
<i>This is what I would consider
a genuine UFO.</i>

34:26.899 --> 34:30.700
There is a flying object here
and I have no idea what it is.

34:35.006 --> 34:36.873
[computer mouse clicking]

34:36.875 --> 34:39.342
<i>[Harry] Image analyst
Conor McCourt runs the footage</i>

34:39.344 --> 34:42.179
<i>through enhancement software.</i>

34:42.181 --> 34:46.883
What I'm doing here is zooming in
and having a good look at this object.

34:46.885 --> 34:50.720
We have one, two,
three and four corners.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.888
<i>It's cube like,</i>

34:51.989 --> 34:55.292
<i>it has reflective properties
that could be metallic.</i>

34:56.627 --> 34:59.262
<i>They're not seeing
wings or other motors</i>

34:59.264 --> 35:01.898
or any kind of
mechanical devices

35:01.900 --> 35:04.334
that would propel this
through the air.

35:04.336 --> 35:07.871
<i>[Harry] And this
is no inflatable balloon.</i>

35:07.873 --> 35:10.006
<i>[Nick] I don't think
this is a balloon</i>

35:10.008 --> 35:13.176
because they're usually designed
to go to much higher altitudes.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.011
<i>They're more of a teardrop shape</i>

35:15.013 --> 35:18.048
<i>as they're pulling a cargo
up into the atmosphere.</i>

35:19.117 --> 35:23.420
There's nothing that indicates
that this object should fly.

35:23.422 --> 35:26.456
<i>It should plummet
like a stone to the Earth.</i>

35:30.394 --> 35:31.327
<i>[Harry] Coming up...</i>

35:31.395 --> 35:33.730
<i>Is this craft
linked to a scientist</i>

35:33.732 --> 35:35.899
<i>who mysteriously disappeared?</i>

35:35.901 --> 35:40.971
<i>[Tim] So she's claiming she
could make a gravity force field,</i>

35:40.973 --> 35:45.775
something that the American
government wanted to keep as a secret.

35:45.777 --> 35:49.246
- [distorted radio static]

35:56.921 --> 36:00.090
<i>[Harry] A mysterious craft
is spotted by an airline pilot</i>

36:00.092 --> 36:03.660
<i>30,000 feet
above the skies of Colombia.</i>

36:06.464 --> 36:10.267
<i>Historian Craig Gottlieb finds
more reports of flying objects</i>

36:10.269 --> 36:12.002
<i>that like this spinning cube</i>

36:12.004 --> 36:15.305
<i>seem to defy
the physics of flight.</i>

36:15.307 --> 36:18.975
In 2017, journalists
published leaked footage

36:18.977 --> 36:21.344
captured by Navy pilots

36:21.346 --> 36:23.380
of unidentified
aerial phenomena.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.749
<i>[Harry] In 2004,</i>

36:25.751 --> 36:27.717
<i>the USS Nimitz carrier group</i>

36:27.719 --> 36:30.020
<i>patrolling the waters
off San Diego,</i>

36:30.022 --> 36:34.357
<i>spots an unidentified object
on its radar.</i>

36:34.359 --> 36:38.828
<i>FA 18 super hornets
are scrambled to investigate</i>

36:38.830 --> 36:41.965
<i>and what they find
is mind boggling.</i>

36:41.967 --> 36:45.302
The pilot reports seeing
like a Tic Tac shaped craft

36:45.304 --> 36:47.971
<i>close to the surface
of the water.</i>

36:47.973 --> 36:50.807
<i>- [pilot] IHR2, it's following behind, over.
- [beeping]</i>

36:50.809 --> 36:52.209
<i>[Paco] Hold it up,
It's just hanging there</i>

36:52.211 --> 36:55.045
with no visible means
of lift or thrust.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.346
[beeping]

36:56.348 --> 36:59.916
<i>[Paco] If it was a helicopter
or an aero type V style jet,</i>

36:59.918 --> 37:03.653
there would just be
a massive plume of hot gases

37:03.655 --> 37:04.921
that would be flowing from it.

37:04.923 --> 37:09.125
<i>None of that
occurs on this footage.</i>

37:09.127 --> 37:13.964
<i>[Harry] And it pulls maneuvers which
would tear a normal airplane apart.</i>

37:13.966 --> 37:15.632
And suddenly
it takes off vertically.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.200
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:17.202 --> 37:19.836
<i>- [Craig] Accelerates out.
- [indistinct radio chatter]</i>

37:19.838 --> 37:21.204
<i>[Paco] Very quickly.
You know, it goes</i>

37:21.206 --> 37:22.672
from zero to whatever,

37:22.674 --> 37:23.974
800 miles an hour or more,

37:23.976 --> 37:26.376
1000 an hour almost instantly.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.979
<i>That G Force would be,</i>

37:28.981 --> 37:31.281
<i>I think fatal to any human.</i>

37:31.283 --> 37:32.449
[beeping]

37:33.818 --> 37:35.685
<i>[Harry] In 2015,</i>

37:35.687 --> 37:38.188
<i>a similar craft
is spotted again,</i>

37:38.190 --> 37:40.690
<i>this time,
off the east coast of America.</i>

37:41.792 --> 37:43.793
<i>[Tim] What's
really interesting is</i>

37:43.795 --> 37:45.495
<i>you can hear the pilots' voice</i>

37:45.497 --> 37:47.530
and they're really surprised.

37:48.032 --> 37:50.300
[pilot 1 speaking]

37:54.438 --> 37:55.805
- [laughter]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

37:55.807 --> 37:56.940
[pilot 2 speaking]

37:56.942 --> 37:58.708
<i>[man over radio] Yeah,
it's just strafing.</i>

37:59.410 --> 38:01.378
[pilot 1 speaking]

38:06.217 --> 38:09.185
<i>[Harry] The Pentagon confirms
the footage is genuine,</i>

38:09.187 --> 38:13.123
<i>but has no explanation
for what the object could be.</i>

38:13.125 --> 38:16.726
And if governments are
releasing genuine footage of UFOs

38:16.728 --> 38:18.862
and they themselves
don't know what it is,

38:18.864 --> 38:21.298
then that's something probably
we should worry about.

38:21.300 --> 38:25.402
<i>[Harry] The United States
now acknowledges that UFOs</i>

38:25.404 --> 38:28.338
<i>like the one in the footage
shot by the Colombian pilot,</i>

38:28.340 --> 38:29.839
<i>exist,</i>

38:29.841 --> 38:32.809
<i>but the notion that
they could be alien spacecraft</i>

38:32.811 --> 38:37.213
<i>could be a smokescreen
perpetuated by the military.</i>

38:37.215 --> 38:40.650
So some are claiming
that Pentagon is creating

38:40.652 --> 38:43.053
this quote "UFO hype"

38:43.120 --> 38:45.221
for a cover story

38:45.223 --> 38:50.894
<i>because they don't want people
knowing about their special projects.</i>

38:50.896 --> 38:55.665
<i>[Harry] Special projects that could
change life on Earth as we know it.</i>

38:55.667 --> 38:57.934
For years now,
there have been theories about

38:57.936 --> 39:01.237
<i>the development
of anti-gravity technology.</i>

39:01.239 --> 39:03.306
<i>[Harry] Gravity
is an invisible force</i>

39:03.308 --> 39:07.277
<i>that pulls smaller objects
towards larger ones.</i>

39:07.279 --> 39:10.380
<i>It's what holds the planets
in orbit around the Sun,</i>

39:10.382 --> 39:11.414
<i>and on Earth,</i>

39:11.416 --> 39:14.184
<i>it keeps objects on the ground.</i>

39:14.186 --> 39:16.519
<i>Planes and birds
can overcome the force</i>

39:16.521 --> 39:18.388
<i>with lift and thrust.</i>

39:18.889 --> 39:20.323
<i>But ultimately,</i>

39:20.325 --> 39:23.293
<i>what goes up must come down.</i>

39:24.095 --> 39:25.462
<i>But what if it didn't?</i>

39:25.464 --> 39:27.997
<i>Could scientists discover a way</i>

39:27.999 --> 39:31.267
<i>to shield something
from the force of gravity?</i>

39:31.269 --> 39:34.537
<i>In other words,
an anti-gravity device?</i>

39:34.939 --> 39:36.506
It sounds far-fetched,

39:36.841 --> 39:39.876
but the U.S. military has been seeking
to harness anti-gravity technology

39:39.878 --> 39:42.112
for over 70 years.

39:42.114 --> 39:45.949
The implications of anti-gravity
technology are enormous.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.452
<i>[Harry] Whole cities
could potentially be suspended</i>

39:49.454 --> 39:52.789
<i>in the sky
or deep under the sea.</i>

39:52.791 --> 39:54.357
<i>The design
and layout of buildings</i>

39:54.359 --> 39:57.093
<i>would alter
in unimaginable ways.</i>

39:57.095 --> 40:00.296
I mean, we're talking
science fiction stuff here.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.732
<i>[Harry] But
spaceflight historian</i>

40:02.734 --> 40:05.735
<i>Amy Shira Teitel
has uncovered evidence</i>

40:05.737 --> 40:08.538
<i>that the theoretical world
of anti-gravity</i>

40:08.540 --> 40:11.941
<i>is secretly starting
to move into practice.</i>

40:11.943 --> 40:12.942
<i>[Amy] In the 1990s,</i>

40:12.944 --> 40:15.578
physicist Ning Li releases work,

40:15.580 --> 40:20.884
saying that she's figured out
how to shield the effects of gravity.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.953
<i>[Harry] Dr. Ning Li's theory
declared that if a magnetic field</i>

40:23.955 --> 40:26.489
<i>was applied
to superconductive ions</i>

40:26.491 --> 40:28.758
<i>trapped in a lattice structure,</i>

40:28.760 --> 40:31.060
<i>they would begin to rapidly spin</i>

40:31.062 --> 40:33.363
<i>and create
a gravitational field,</i>

40:33.365 --> 40:36.766
<i>counteracting
Earth's gravitational pull.</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:37.767
And so she's claiming

40:37.769 --> 40:41.137
she can make
a gravity force field.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.544
[Harry] <i>Anti-Gravity technology
would allow craft to move</i>

40:47.546 --> 40:50.413
<i>in previously impossible ways.</i>

40:52.183 --> 40:54.217
<i>They might look
like the object filmed</i>

40:54.219 --> 40:56.453
<i>by the pilot
flying over Colombia.</i>

40:58.355 --> 41:00.089
<i>In 2001,</i>

41:00.091 --> 41:03.660
<i>Dr. Li receives a half a million
dollars from the Pentagon</i>

41:03.662 --> 41:05.962
<i>to further her research.</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:07.864
<i>And in 2003,</i>

41:07.866 --> 41:10.099
<i>she announces a breakthrough.</i>

41:10.835 --> 41:13.169
She had sent an email
to her colleague

41:13.171 --> 41:19.809
saying she had demonstrated a
large amount of anti-gravity phenomena

41:19.811 --> 41:21.377
and she was excited about it.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.448
<i>So had Ning Li
discovered something</i>

41:25.450 --> 41:29.686
<i>that the American government
wanted to keep as a secret?</i>

41:32.289 --> 41:33.423
<i>[Antonio] Is that
what we're seeing here</i>

41:33.425 --> 41:36.259
is some type of
experimental aircraft?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.361
<i>[Harry] If the U.S. government
has knowledge</i>

41:38.363 --> 41:40.230
<i>of these gravity defying craft</i>

41:40.232 --> 41:42.699
<i>flying above the skies
of the Americas...</i>

41:42.701 --> 41:44.634
[indistinct radio chatter]

41:46.704 --> 41:48.571
[Harry]
<i>they're not admitting it.</i>

41:51.242 --> 41:53.042
<i>[Tim] This footage is proof</i>

41:53.044 --> 41:55.678
that there's a whole lot more
going on in the skies

41:55.680 --> 41:57.347
that we don't know about.
