00:26.530 --> 00:30.720
I'd come to this project with many of
the same assumptions that you have -

00:30.720 --> 00:36.280
concerning the Jersey double murders and
the guilt of Jim Suerd.

00:36.280 --> 00:40.050
His characterization is a troubled young man,
responsible for a spree of horrific,

00:40.050 --> 00:46.410
ritualistic homicides in the Pine
Barrens. The question in my mind was why?

00:46.410 --> 00:52.660
Why would a man commit such crimes? After reviewing hours of archived footage

00:52.660 --> 00:58.870
generated by Steven Avkast and Locus
Wheeler, the hosts of Fact or Fiction,

00:58.870 --> 01:06.100
I've been forced to change my perspective. the question now for me is what?

01:06.100 --> 01:11.900
What really happened that night and is Jim Suerd truly responsible?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.920
Ironically, in the course of this project,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.860
Jim Suerd has died in prison under mysterious causes.

01:19.460 --> 01:23.760
His death will forever shroud the reconciliation of this case.

01:25.740 --> 01:31.160
As they said on fact or fiction, you decide.

01:52.620 --> 01:55.820
(Operator) Nine-one-one, what is your emergency?

01:55.820 --> 01:57.260
My name is Jim Stewart Suerd.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.180
I just hitchhiked here

01:59.180 --> 02:02.500
from from the middle of pine barrens and I can't seem to get -

02:02.509 --> 02:05.600
I can't seem to find the people that
I was in the Pine Barrens with -

02:05.600 --> 02:07.620
And I was camping with them last night doing a project

02:07.620 --> 02:09.060
(Operator) Are you lost?

02:09.240 --> 02:14.080
I'm not lost. I'm just trying - I can't find the
people who drove me here and -

02:15.820 --> 02:19.480
I looked around for him and I went back to
the site where we had parked and they're

02:19.480 --> 02:22.680
not at the van and they're nowhere to be
found like I don't know where they are.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.801
(Operator) Their vehicle is still there?

02:24.801 --> 02:26.540
The vehicle's still there and I had to

02:26.540 --> 02:28.640
hitchhike to this payphone.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.120
(Operator) How far are you from the vehicle right now?

02:32.420 --> 02:36.580
I'm about five five, somewhere you know five-ten miles from it I don't know.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.160
Okay, Jim. We'll send someone out.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.760
Yeah it would be a good idea I got a really bad feeling about it.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.180
You might want to send somebody
out quickly ever bad feeling...

02:55.030 --> 02:58.990
(radio announcer) WBRK time it is five o'clock. It's time for that afternoon drive that you love so much.

02:58.990 --> 03:03.460
Hey, guess who made missing reports?
It's those hosts from Fact or Fiction.

03:03.740 --> 03:09.400
Missing. Ha. Bob, you know those guys gonna be showing up sometime in the next day saying, "Surprise did you miss us?"

03:09.660 --> 03:12.660
Let's go to the phones and we'll ask you. Do you miss them?

03:18.960 --> 03:21.600
We have found bodies. At this time we don't know who they are,

03:21.820 --> 03:24.380
or how many we have found.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.020
We cannot assume at this time that it is

03:28.020 --> 03:29.620
the Fact or Fiction crew.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.940
At this time, we have arrested Jim Suerd

03:39.940 --> 03:43.420
for the murders of Rein Clackin and Locus Wheeler.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.000
Behind me is a house where Jim Suerd

03:46.000 --> 03:49.100
resided until his arrest nearly seven
months ago.

03:49.560 --> 03:55.800
Inside, amongst his dirty laundry, blood evidence was found, linking him to the grisly Fact or Fiction murders.

03:56.180 --> 04:01.380
Today, Jim's own life hangs in the balance as jurors decide his fate.

04:11.740 --> 04:14.660
I had heard of the Factor or Fiction murders.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.380
They were big news for a period of one year,

04:17.880 --> 04:20.800
and then like so many things in today's
fast-paced world,

04:21.180 --> 04:23.200
were forgotten.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.080
I was intrigued by how this case, this story,
was so well documented.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.100
How, in spite of the remote location of the murders,

04:32.100 --> 04:34.600
and the rural nature of the people prosecuting Jim,

04:34.780 --> 04:37.520
that these were murders
of a high tech age.

04:38.060 --> 04:42.980
I was intrigued by the fact that the four individuals were
indeed children of a digital age.

04:43.940 --> 04:49.460
Mostly though, I wondered why the man named Jim Suerd would commit such horrendous acts of violence.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.960
This is Johnny,

05:20.960 --> 05:22.000
and Locus

05:22.240 --> 05:24.300
and we are live in the Pine Barrens where tonight

05:24.310 --> 05:31.930
we are doing a first-ever, internet
broadcast, cable, ham radio - broadcast

05:31.930 --> 05:34.220
all live, all real

05:34.220 --> 05:37.750
and we are doing it with the help of a psychic and a sound man.

05:37.750 --> 05:42.460
who has the ability to record sounds
from other worlds, otherworldly sounds.

05:42.980 --> 05:47.420
Yeah, that's right, Steven. We're here in
the Pine Barrens southern New Jersey

05:47.660 --> 05:51.600
live and direct, coming right at you in your living room, first-ever web

05:51.600 --> 05:57.280
simulcast cable, cast and everybody is on
the edge of their seat and I know you are,

05:57.280 --> 06:00.820
because I am and I'm sure Steven is
too.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.200
A little later we're gonna be showing you the campsite,

06:03.480 --> 06:06.060
but right now we're gonna do a little recapping,

06:06.340 --> 06:09.620
and you're gonna see some tape of the
history of the legend -

06:09.860 --> 06:12.900
of the Pine Barrens and the Jersey Devil.

06:16.840 --> 06:21.060
They actually lived their show, Fact or Fiction.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.420
Here's this real eerie circumstances
that come the play

06:24.900 --> 06:26.440
And they were actually the victims of it.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.860
He had the opportunity.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.600
It appears as if he had the motive.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.480
He did lure those people up there in a in a veil of secrecy.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.260
I would say yeah he fits the profile.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.020
Who was Jim Suerd?

06:45.020 --> 06:48.420
The answer proved more difficult than I imagined.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.800
His mother had died four months before the murders,

06:50.800 --> 06:54.330
His father, five years before.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.920
The only two people that I was able to speak
with that knew him personally were his

06:58.920 --> 07:06.650
landlady, Joyce Dryer and a childhood
psychologist named Dr. Dale Orstall.

07:09.590 --> 07:15.770
I was sort of a father figure to him, I feel.
Sort of a surrogate father, if you will.

07:15.770 --> 07:20.340
He didn't talk a whole lot about his family life

07:20.340 --> 07:24.300
but one of the things I know

07:24.640 --> 07:30.340
is that his father left them when he was
very young, ran off with another woman.

07:32.180 --> 07:37.920
He had few friends if any. Very reclusive.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.780
I remember him being quite a loner.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.280
He seemed to stay in his room
quite a bit when he wasn't at work.

07:47.220 --> 07:54.740
And the computer seemed to be a highlight in his in his life.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.560
With the advent of the Internet,

07:57.560 --> 08:01.940
of course he got into that years after I I was seeing him.

08:02.740 --> 08:06.500
It wasn't even available I don't think at the time

08:08.180 --> 08:14.640
It opened up a whole new world for a guy like Jim.

08:15.080 --> 08:21.160
Often he would be on the internet with people

08:21.160 --> 08:27.840
and as we know the horrible situation that has come up because of the internet fiasco,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.400
with him being blamed for these
murders.

08:32.120 --> 08:37.679
The internet was the first interests that would attach him to the Fact or Fiction television show.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.100
The second interest was a bit more obscure.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.039
Jim had this fascination for magic.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.200
I mean a true fascination - I mean he like I told you he was very reclusive

08:47.200 --> 08:51.120
so I believe he must have spent
countless hours in his room alone

08:51.130 --> 08:53.200
working on tricks.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.510
And he used to come in and start the sessions and he had to

08:56.510 --> 09:03.650
show me a new trick and often was a
simple card trick but very quickly he

09:03.650 --> 09:07.320
built skills and became very proficient
in magic.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.920
The internet and magic - both interests generally considered harmless.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.480
Both interests that could have a sinister edge to them.

09:16.240 --> 09:22.580
Either way, it was a combination that virtually sealed his fate in meeting Steven Avkast and Locus Wheeler,

09:23.720 --> 09:25.840
The hosts of Fact or Fiction.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
Welcome to Fact or Fiction.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.840
Welcome to Fact or Fiction. Yes we are
rolling. We are on we are ready to go.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.320
Locus you joker, you knew it all along that we were on.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.960
Yeah welcome to our new show, well actually it's not a new show, it's got a new name.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.850
Thanks to everybody out there who helped us come up with this great name,

09:49.850 --> 09:51.400
Fact or Fiction

09:51.400 --> 09:52.240
That's right.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.820
Fact or Fiction was one of those fluke successes that no television producer would ever predict.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.560
Short on production value, talent and execution,

10:01.820 --> 10:07.640
It maintained a following of youth probably more amused by its Kitsch value than anything else.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.760
Steven Avkast, the creator of Fact or
Fiction is remembered.

10:13.520 --> 10:20.150
Steven... I always got bad bad vibes about Steven, you know he always came in here with this you

10:20.160 --> 10:24.960
know attitude that you know he always
doing is making a little cable show.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.600
I mean, nobody ever goes anywhere with this stuff. But he had this idea

10:29.840 --> 10:32.360
he was destined for stardom and
was gonna be rich, you know

10:32.360 --> 10:36.020
millions of dollars and you know he
basically had that that big you know

10:36.020 --> 10:40.490
director stereotype that you think
of you, know, you think of the big

10:40.490 --> 10:44.680
Hollywood directors and I mean he really
just had to put it in perspective.

10:45.520 --> 10:51.080
Steven's longtime friend, Locus Wheeler,
was the co-host of the show.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.640
Their pairing was like oil and water.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.560
Locus, I think,

10:55.560 --> 11:01.100
he and Steven were having problems getting along sometimes but I
think I I think

11:01.400 --> 11:05.320
Locus, he knew what he was doing. I mean with this he knew it was just a little

11:05.320 --> 11:08.280
cable show and I think he was just in it
for the fun.

11:08.720 --> 11:14.460
Somehow, Steven, a misguided egomaniac and Locus, a sardonic slacker,

11:14.680 --> 11:18.500
managed to keep turning out shows for the better part of 1995.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
The ideas were slim.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.360
However, they did latch onto one idea that intrigued many.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.720
We're also doing something new. We are on IRC tonight. and we have joined... IRC is in the house.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.540
You can say that, I'm saying it's swingin'

11:32.780 --> 11:34.300
Well I'll have to say one idea they
came up with,

11:34.300 --> 11:39.640
it was actually - well at first it was pretty cool but it got to be pretty freaky too...

11:39.640 --> 11:43.190
They came up with this idea, you know how most TV shows will have like call ins.

11:43.190 --> 11:46.670
where people call in the phone and talk -
well, they tie this into the internet

11:46.670 --> 11:50.750
through IRC chat,
except, so people could like, you know

11:50.750 --> 11:55.840
ask questions on the show - but they rigged up some sort of text-to-speech converter so

11:55.840 --> 11:59.680
like whatever they typed in was actually
set on the show like it was a voice.

12:00.100 --> 12:05.460
It was this idea that provided the impetus for what would ironically give Steven the fame he so craved.

12:05.840 --> 12:10.880
By the fall of 1995, the one joke television show was losing popularity.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.280
By November, the show was about to self-destruct.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.360
Everybody had this sense.

12:16.840 --> 12:21.560
Once again, Steven in his delinquency and procrastination has made it

12:21.600 --> 12:27.680
so we are too late to find the snow angel.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.080
At this desperate time, Steven turned to viewer suggestions,

12:33.080 --> 12:35.680
one of which would take hold in his mind.

12:36.560 --> 12:42.400
It provided the seedling with which Steven hoped to rebuild the show's popularity.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.320
you know we had a call we have an IRC
come in and it's real eerie voice I mean

12:47.320 --> 12:51.490
it drove me nuts. I almost couldn't stand
this after a while because just

12:51.490 --> 12:56.560
hearing this voice like "hello, why don't
you do a piece on..."

12:56.560 --> 13:02.240
(robotic voice) Why don't you do a show about the Jersey Devil?

13:03.200 --> 13:08.000
Steven's idea was to do a first-ever live broadcast of Fact or Fiction.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.360
It would be broadcast simultaneously to cable television and the Internet.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.640
The promotion's began immediately.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.640
And with ratings dropping in
an ever-increasing speed,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.200
The concept was implemented immediately.

13:20.760 --> 13:28.360
This Jersey Devil cablecast, I knew it wasn't gonna work. I mean these guys couldn't even make a halfway decent TV Show.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.240
Suddenly they want to jump into doing you know big time live from the Pine Barrens

13:33.240 --> 13:37.480
and have radio and Internet and this and that and,

13:37.480 --> 13:41.860
I knew it was gonna be fiasco. I didn't really
think was gonna end up like it did but -

13:41.860 --> 13:43.600
I knew it wasn't gonna look pretty.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.660
Since the show was going to air from a remote location,

13:47.660 --> 13:50.440
Steven hastily looked for people who help.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.280
A former employer of his, Sam woods, was approached.

13:54.920 --> 13:59.880
This is the room of Sam woods. I used to cut his grass.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.000
He's a filmmaker

14:02.880 --> 14:05.320
and he used to do soap operas and

14:06.400 --> 14:11.240
we're gonna ask him if he wants to direct the show...

14:11.980 --> 14:17.260
Because I think he'd be perfect and he's a name and that would that good for us.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.360
So I've had to talk to Locus and try to

14:20.360 --> 14:23.860
convince him about but he's going for
it... and here they come so, I'm going to turn it down.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.760
Steven... that's right.

14:27.480 --> 14:33.080
And I'm Locus. Nice to meet you.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.560
Well they say that up to up to 50,000 people could possibly be watching at any time,

14:38.560 --> 14:40.360
but they don't know exactly how many but

14:40.360 --> 14:42.880
but we're selling lots of t-shirts.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.520
So that's a good sign I think.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.920
Anyway we have this idea we want to taking this like direction

14:49.220 --> 14:52.520
where it's gonna become much
bigger and it'll be really cool if you

14:52.520 --> 14:56.120
could you know help us out; if you could
direct the show. I know that you used to

14:56.120 --> 14:57.720
direct soap operas.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.460
Network soaps.

15:01.440 --> 15:08.280
This union of cable access show and former Network soap director never made sense to anyone.

15:08.740 --> 15:13.100
Though it was later discovered that Steven was paying Sam out of his own pocket

15:13.380 --> 15:16.280
in an act of desperation to save Fact or Fiction.

15:18.160 --> 15:26.920
We're in business yeah... yeah this is cool.

15:30.500 --> 15:36.090
Sam Woods, a once successful television soap director

15:36.090 --> 15:39.160
became one of the people I would question about these
events.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.660
In stark contrast to his work,

15:41.660 --> 15:45.560
meeting him was another road sign on my travel into a surreal world.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.320
Well, this devil hunt thing never appealed to me.

15:48.320 --> 15:52.000
We're getting into a pretty flaky area there, you know?

15:52.600 --> 15:57.590
I think the kids were they were asking for it with that one.

15:57.590 --> 16:02.180
Not the kind of not the kind of
work I do, you know what I mean?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.320
Not what I do.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.440
For the internet end, Jay McDowell
was enlisted.

16:06.880 --> 16:11.640
Well, they came to me with a seedling idea they said you know

16:12.360 --> 16:15.200
we want it we want to use some of this technology you've been using for
teleconferencing

16:15.840 --> 16:20.280
for video conferencing and we want to, you know, we want to turn this into a broadcasting.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.400
They had heard some talk about it they
had seen some sites that were trying to

16:23.400 --> 16:27.880
do some stuff like that, so they wanted
something like that they wanted to do it

16:28.440 --> 16:33.280
a live a live thing rather than like, you
know, streaming canned video.

16:33.900 --> 16:36.840
They wanted to actually broadcast and compress it all live.

16:36.980 --> 16:43.020
So they basically just came to me with that seedling of an idea and I had to figure out, you know,

16:43.020 --> 16:47.260
the technical aspects of how to make it happen, and make it real and

16:47.540 --> 16:51.160
you know, kind of the packaging for it what it was really gonna be in the final product.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.940
Steven and Locus decided that they
needed additional help at the actual location.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.720
They searched vaguely for a
sound man and a guide

16:59.720 --> 17:03.480
and on December 7, 1995, worlds collided.

17:04.040 --> 17:09.200
Okay, we're at Rein's and we've come today to meet him
in hopes that he'll be able to help us

17:09.200 --> 17:13.790
out on our trip to the Pine Barrens.
Basically Rein is an audio whiz and

17:13.790 --> 17:19.400
supposeBly he's been able to document -
supposeDly he's been able to document

17:19.400 --> 17:24.359
you know paranormal occurrences on tape.
So that's what we're gonna see today.

17:24.359 --> 17:28.520
We're also going to be meeting Jim, who
does some psychic things

17:28.780 --> 17:32.540
And we'll see, you know. Hopefully these guys will fit the bill and we'll be able to go down to

17:32.560 --> 17:35.520
the Pine Barrens with them, you know.
Could use the extra help.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.300
Is that good? yeah you got enough?

17:40.400 --> 17:43.740
I hope this damn mic works. You ready?
okay.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.000
Remember, play it cool. Play it cool.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.120
is this gonna blow us this airplane
sound?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.440
Come one.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.960
Steven, this is Rein.

17:59.280 --> 18:02.800
right yeah I'm, I'm Locus. Locus?

18:02.800 --> 18:07.340
(weird echo sounds)

18:08.800 --> 18:10.640
So you just taped us?

18:10.640 --> 18:12.920
Yeah, I guess so accidentally.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.080
So do you have a surveillance setup?

18:15.400 --> 18:24.840
Well, for the time being I did. This used to be a sound studio.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.160
I think maybe Jim has arrived now.

18:32.120 --> 18:36.960
hey man, you seem to have pre-deterrmined that we met.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.640
hold on hey hey yeah Jim what's up?

18:40.640 --> 18:42.160
how are you?

18:42.160 --> 18:42.940
Doing pretty good.

18:43.100 --> 18:43.660
Lotus.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.471
um... Locus.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.720
How are you? I'm Jim.

18:52.120 --> 18:57.600
It was inevitable that this combination of the internet, a television show about paranormal happenings,

18:57.640 --> 19:02.960
and similar ages, would draw Jim Suerd to Fact or Fiction.

19:04.840 --> 19:11.420
so just to give some, a little background, you know basically we're going to be doing this

19:11.420 --> 19:17.420
webcast, cablecast in the in search of
the Jersey Devil, the Leeds devil,

19:17.429 --> 19:21.539
down in the Pine Barrens. And basically why we've gotten you guys together here is

19:21.539 --> 19:27.419
because you have skills regarding audio
and paranormal activity so we're hoping

19:27.420 --> 19:31.440
that you can help us in that way, and you
have these psychic abilities.

19:31.920 --> 19:37.560
Psychic abilities, I feel that I can I can really help out. I understand what you're trying to do and

19:37.560 --> 19:39.580
I really think that I can help out.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.760
You can help us find help us find a location.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.840
you can help us tap into whatever we
need.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.840
I can pinpoint that location.

19:48.340 --> 19:54.560
Jim came to me one day and told me how
excited he was that he had met these

19:54.560 --> 20:00.840
people over the Internet. It was some
show, Fact or Fiction,

20:01.260 --> 20:05.300
and he was to be their guide in the Pine Barrens

20:05.300 --> 20:09.040
and what really amazed me, I just didn't think

20:09.040 --> 20:14.779
he knew or had any knowledge of the Pine
Barrens to be able to even be a guide.

20:14.779 --> 20:18.840
But he seemed so excited about it.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.400
This... is this good?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.400
Do you want to hold them up or do you

20:23.600 --> 20:26.240
Just like this.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.460
Six Spade.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.400
Seven Spade.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.720
Four Spade.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.840
Five Spade

20:46.700 --> 20:47.760
Eight Club.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.880
Eight Diamond.

21:07.360 --> 21:13.740
I saw him probably about two or three
weeks before the incident.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.940
I ran into him at a shopping mall.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.820
And he was very excited about his life.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.240
He said he was studying acting.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.900
His magic was coming together. People were appreciating it.

21:29.919 --> 21:34.899
combined with the acting, I guess he did
a few gigs on a small level but it was

21:34.899 --> 21:37.200
it was going very very well.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.480
Give him more ashes. Give him more ashes.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.960
There's something on his arm.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.680
What does this mean?

22:00.680 --> 22:03.160
I don't know

22:07.240 --> 22:10.120
Back off. Back off. Are you recording this?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.320
Was Jim psychic?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.280
It was not likely.

22:16.740 --> 22:17.940
The card demonstration,

22:18.200 --> 22:21.760
and the supposed psychic fit, in which numbers appeared on his arm,

22:21.760 --> 22:23.780
were nothing more than simple tricks.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.100
- Known to any amateur magician.

22:26.920 --> 22:32.780
To Steven and Locus, Rein Clackin and Jim Suerd were perfect for Fact or Fiction.

22:33.180 --> 22:37.240
Youthful, eager and strange.

22:46.400 --> 22:56.000
On December 15th 1995, Steve Avkast, Lous Wheeler, Rein Clackin and Jim Suerd

22:56.300 --> 23:00.200
headed for the Pine Barrens of New Jersey to do a live broadcast

23:00.200 --> 23:02.420
in search of the Jersey Devil.

23:03.600 --> 23:07.220
Jim Suerd would be the only one to return.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.320
nine-one-one what is your emergency?

23:13.080 --> 23:18.320
My name is Jim Suerd and I just hitchhiked here from the middle of Pine Barrens.

23:18.620 --> 23:23.140
and I can't seem to get - I can't seem to find the people that I was in the Pine Barrens with

23:23.500 --> 23:24.340
with an us camping with him last night
doing a project.

23:24.740 --> 23:25.660
(operator) Are you lost?

23:25.900 --> 23:30.560
I'm not I'm not lost I'm just trying to
I can't find the people who drove me here.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.820
and you know I looked around for
them and I went back to the site where we

23:35.820 --> 23:38.730
had parked and they're not at the van
and they're nowhere to be found like I

23:38.730 --> 23:39.700
don't know where they are.

23:40.260 --> 23:42.160
(operator) Their vehicle is still there?

23:42.160 --> 23:43.140
The vehicle is still there.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.120
and I had to hitchhike to this payphone.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.180
(operator) How far are you from the vehicle right now?

23:48.580 --> 23:54.400
I'm about five five, somewhere, you know -
five ten miles from it. I don't know.

23:54.420 --> 23:56.040
(operator) Okay Jim, we'll send someone out.

23:56.480 --> 24:04.300
After mr. Suerd made the call, we went to the area that he specified and did a preliminary look around,

24:04.560 --> 24:08.500
under a missing-persons investigation.

24:08.820 --> 24:14.520
I mean I just figured that was one of the little stints to do just to try to get that extra sensationalism.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.160
so I I didn't think anything of it at first.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.700
You know I kind of expected them to try something like that.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.420
We have a 187. Repeat, we have a 187.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.840
This isn't a missing person's report anymore.

24:28.740 --> 24:29.500
912?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.640
We're clear. Do you need emergency support?

24:34.460 --> 24:35.100
1012

24:36.480 --> 24:38.500
No. This guy's definitely DOA.

24:39.260 --> 24:44.340
One body we found approximately 2.5 miles from the campsite.

24:44.680 --> 24:49.420
The other body, we found approximately three miles from the campsite.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.500
The body of Steven Avkast was never found.

24:53.600 --> 24:59.880
Large amounts of blood in the snow and a hat were all that remained of this third victim.

25:00.500 --> 25:05.160
In any murder investigation, anybody
associated with the victims is a suspect.

25:05.179 --> 25:11.460
our job is to eliminate suspects based
on the evidence that we sift through and

25:11.460 --> 25:16.559
that we gather, and as we sifted through
and gathered this evidence there was

25:16.560 --> 25:21.620
only one suspect left at the end and
that was mr. Jim Suerd.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.620
Who led everybody to the site?

25:24.080 --> 25:24.580
I did.

25:24.900 --> 25:28.100
Did anybody else know where you were going to set up and camp?

25:28.380 --> 25:32.280
Well, I was asked to uh, to find a place to camp.

25:32.520 --> 25:39.440
And I thought that I was doing a good job at
it and Rein continued to provoke me and uh

25:39.440 --> 25:43.840
and then give me a hard time about my
ability to locate the place

25:44.480 --> 25:50.460
that we would camp and ultimately just good led to an
argument and I ran away from the group.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.240
Did you hit him first?

25:53.220 --> 25:55.740
I don't know, I might have pushed him.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.100
Sometimes I can't remember if I, you know.

26:00.640 --> 26:07.180
I ran away from group and I found the spot I thought would be good to locate the Jersey Devil.

26:07.960 --> 26:12.640
After we got the permission from
the state of Pennsylvania to search

26:12.650 --> 26:17.720
Mr. Suerd's residence, we went to his
residence and we did conduct a search

26:17.720 --> 26:23.210
for anything that we felt would help us
in this case and we did find the

26:23.210 --> 26:25.540
garments that mr. Suerd was wearing
that night,

26:25.760 --> 26:27.480
with the blood of the three victims on it.

26:27.480 --> 26:31.920
Interestingly, the garments that mr. Suerd was wearing were merely

26:32.060 --> 26:36.020
lying right on his bedroom floor, along
with the other dirty laundry that was there.

26:40.400 --> 26:46.200
Even as Jim was arrested, the evidence continued to mount against him.

26:47.580 --> 26:53.480
We could tell that the nature of the
blows with the weapons that were used

26:53.480 --> 26:59.720
were consistent with the size and build
of the accused.

27:00.060 --> 27:08.400
In this case it was very clear that the attacker was using both hands with two weapons and was ambidextrous.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.540
And the suspect in this case is ambidextrous, which is quite rare.

27:12.720 --> 27:18.100
He was the only survivor in the place
where nobody else was.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.760
It doesn't look that good for him.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.780
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

27:24.020 --> 27:29.140
we will show that on December 15th 1995, Jim Suerd maliciously and with premeditation

27:29.140 --> 27:32.100
killed Rein Clackin and Locus Wheeler.

27:32.500 --> 27:36.420
We will show, without doubt, how he planned this well in advance of that day.

27:36.720 --> 27:43.580
We will show, with video shot by the deceased, that Jim Suerd was, and is, a devious and cunning person.

27:43.580 --> 27:47.760
using the guise of psychic to perpetrate these horrible acts.

27:47.760 --> 27:52.600
The proceedings that summer turned out to be one of the greatest spectacles of Baroake County history.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.040
The trial attracted a strange assemblage of cult followers,

27:55.040 --> 28:00.320
ritual homicide fanatics and others seeking to satisfy their morbid curiosity.

28:00.780 --> 28:04.300
Eventually, it became a matter of trying to keep the tabloid at bay.

28:04.740 --> 28:06.520
An effort which was not entirely successful .

28:06.520 --> 28:13.480
When the court case came up, the media frenzy was hysterical.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.960
I felt like they were you -- somebody was watching me like every minute.

28:19.160 --> 28:23.960
They were talking to everybody, everybody who had the slightest thing to do with the show.

28:24.340 --> 28:28.920
Who knows, they probably talked to every single viewer that said they watched the show.

28:30.360 --> 28:35.850
Reporters day in and day out and police
here just taking everything they could;

28:35.850 --> 28:41.880
anything it was every videotape every
prop, and I mean it was ridiculous.

28:41.880 --> 28:45.460
I don't know what they were looking for,
all they were getting was a bunch of bad television.

28:48.660 --> 28:54.100
In an election year, what the prosecution was looking for was an open and shut case.

28:54.340 --> 28:59.220
And in the state of New Jersey versus Jim Suerd, they found it.

28:59.220 --> 29:03.810
Not content to leave any stone unturned they decided to utilize the very video that

29:03.810 --> 29:06.860
Steven Avkast and Locus Wheeler had
shot.

29:07.160 --> 29:13.980
The man, who would later by the press come to be known as the killer cutter, was hired to go through this video.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.060
and put together an incriminating image of Jim Suerd.

29:18.060 --> 29:24.580
The prosecution contacted me in early
January 1996.

29:24.940 --> 29:30.640
They had a pretty good case against him, it seemed to me from what I saw.

29:30.940 --> 29:37.260
They had blood evidence, they'd found the blood and you know this was the only guy there.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.180
And he was the only one that knew where it was.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.520
But they wanted to clinch this case.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.540
They didn't want, they really wanted to get him.

29:47.540 --> 29:52.100
They didn't want any there to be any question that he had done it.

29:53.140 --> 29:58.420
So they can't that came to me with all this
videotape, like 15 hours of videotape.

29:58.420 --> 30:04.160
And this was video that these guys who did
this cable show had shot on location.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.680
I'd never really edited anything like I mean I'd never seen

30:07.680 --> 30:11.820
anything like this before, I mean this
was like video from the crime scene.

30:11.820 --> 30:16.590
And normally, you know, I've got, you
know, hours and hours of people

30:16.590 --> 30:21.600
talking heads like, you know in
some room somewhere badly shot.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.280
This was badly shot but at least it
was out in the woods, you know.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.000
It was different.

30:27.060 --> 30:30.400
The prosecution's video was intended to show facts.

30:30.680 --> 30:35.720
Perhaps, not inadvertently, it also created an intimacy with the murdered three,

30:35.720 --> 30:37.300
that the defense was unhappy with.

30:40.400 --> 30:45.220
They protested it, deeming it an unfair swaying towards a guilty verdict.

30:45.720 --> 30:51.980
This was not enough reason for the video to be struck down and so it was used.

30:52.820 --> 30:59.860
The first point demonstrated that Jim was indeed leading the group into very remote regions of the Pine Barrens.

30:59.860 --> 31:04.520
Areas where there was no hope for help or aid from the civilized world.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.300
the following represents excerpts

31:07.400 --> 31:10.527
from the first section of the prosecution video.

31:10.527 --> 31:15.460
Over 54 minutes of video showing the for wandering deeper into the pines was shot.

31:16.460 --> 31:22.960
It is estimated that the four walked for more than two hours before Jim finally decided upon the location of their operations.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.220
Hey guys he's starting to go to go. Let's get the stuff together.

31:28.460 --> 31:29.980
so what's the deal Jim?

31:31.560 --> 31:34.280
Something's come right through here.

31:36.780 --> 31:41.340
When Jim finally found the perfect
location, it was more than three miles

31:41.340 --> 31:45.920
from their van and the nearest access road.

31:47.460 --> 31:52.700
The second point was to make evident a
defendant who had an agenda an agenda.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.480
- An agenda warped enough to commit these murders.

31:59.920 --> 32:06.660
I've been contacting the supernatural world for the last week.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
last couple days I've been in contact getting my spiritual self together this journey.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.520
we've we've put put ourselves out on and

32:18.580 --> 32:22.960
we are headed in the right direction, I
can assure you.

32:24.660 --> 32:29.960
I can feel it. It's a gut instinct in my body that -

32:29.960 --> 32:32.880
we're going to find the Leeds devil -

32:33.040 --> 32:39.340
and we're going to settle this case, once and for all.

32:40.880 --> 32:48.820
I feel that know what I'm doing here and for you is perfectly authentic.

32:49.060 --> 32:54.740
I have a feeling inside it's it's a definite feeling -

32:54.740 --> 33:01.220
we are at a place where with the Jersey Devil. We will encounter

33:01.220 --> 33:03.880
The Jersey Devil.

33:04.460 --> 33:05.880
I know we're headed in the right direction.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.820
Repeated phrases such as, "we're
going to settle this thing once and for all"

33:12.800 --> 33:16.600
and "I know we're headed in the right
direction",

33:16.600 --> 33:19.040
seemed to clearly show Jim's agenda.

33:19.620 --> 33:23.920
It didn't take much to read into these phrases,

33:24.500 --> 33:28.320
and see an individual with a plan that was to be carried out in the desolate Pine Barrens.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.500
As the prosecution's video progressed,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.860
Jim's personality changed...

33:35.860 --> 33:38.040
from a quiet and shy person,

33:38.320 --> 33:41.900
to one that presented the prosecution with an opportunity

33:41.920 --> 33:45.440
to show the violent nature just below the surface.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.160
Look man,

33:50.360 --> 33:54.280
I'll see you back at camp, man!

33:56.640 --> 33:59.280
I don't know what Jim's doing.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.320
I think he's talking
about burning something.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.120
An agenda proven, and a potential violent streak proven,

34:05.000 --> 34:11.360
the prosecution solidified their first-degree murder case against Suerd with video taken in the barn.

34:11.400 --> 34:15.120
Video in which the original date of the trip
appeared on Suerd's arm.

34:15.639 --> 34:20.520
The defense attempted to have this also struck from the records,

34:20.560 --> 34:23.280
claiming the video of Suerd to be that of a character he was playing.

34:23.639 --> 34:29.040
The prosecution countered by agreeing fully with this assessment of Suerd and the events in the barn.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.600
events that had taken place a full two
weeks before the trip;

34:33.280 --> 34:36.280
the best argument for premeditated murder.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.680
The trip began at sunrise.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.840
Steven ran a videocamera much of the time,

35:08.840 --> 35:13.440
documenting what should have been
amusing but banal preparation.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.640
Locus, do you wanna do a blurb about?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.640
Yeah, I'll do it.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.600
yeah but I'm getting light... the backlight's killing your face.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.000
What do you mean the backlight's killing my face?

35:29.000 --> 35:33.360
Why don't you adjust it? What do you mean you can't?

35:33.840 --> 35:41.280
okay you ready? Okay, we're here at Rein's barn, and we're getting...

35:41.920 --> 35:46.760
Come on, I'm trying to get at this on camera...

35:49.480 --> 35:56.400
The trip, guided by Jim, took them into
the loneliest of areas on a lonely cold

35:56.960 --> 35:59.360
Here's to you, Steven.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.360
A stop at a gas station was the last obvious landmark,

36:01.360 --> 36:06.320
before they moved into the unidentifiable roads of the Pine Barrens.

36:06.680 --> 36:10.640
at a certain point, at Jim's request,

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
they stopped, parked and started

36:12.960 --> 36:14.040
walking into the woods.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.640
following the psychic visions of Suerd.

36:19.040 --> 36:23.840
He's gonna do it this is part of the show we gotta do it in a place he thinks is right.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.040
Because if we're gonna find something

36:26.040 --> 36:27.160
yeah we could fake it, but I don't go for that.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.800
I think we should go for real

36:29.800 --> 36:34.960
and he's off doing his thing that's why we got him here.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.120
We knew this would be it. We knew, we all
talked about. We knew we were going to be way out here.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.480
Here he comes. Let's see what he says.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.760
Where did you get this guy from anyway?

36:51.320 --> 36:54.360
Psychics R US?

36:56.520 --> 36:58.960
I think this is a pretty good idea.

36:59.360 --> 37:03.200
Us waiting around and then him finding the spot you know and then taking the stuff over to it.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.840
Yeah we still gonna go back to the car and get stuff, man.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.560
I don't think he even knows that.
Is he volunteering ? I don't think so.

37:12.560 --> 37:15.600
Well, I know he's not carrying too much.
But you know what he said about that...

37:16.160 --> 37:17.640
it's a vibe thing.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.880
[Host] Tensions increases as they work further

37:21.280 --> 37:28.160
into the forsaken Pines. And then a key
point in the prosecution video arrives.

37:29.520 --> 37:35.160
Jim... are you a psychic or a psycho?

37:35.800 --> 37:42.400
Look man! I'll see you back at camp!

37:43.960 --> 37:49.680
Approximately one hour later,
judging from the Sun, a camp is being built.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.520
Discussions are already being had about Suerd.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.520
Suerd is not helping.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.200
He's keeping to himself.

37:58.240 --> 38:02.869
For the next two hours, the video of the
group is a collection of promotions for

38:02.880 --> 38:06.770
future cable shows; the camera frequently
left on between takes.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.080
This is Locus reporting from the Pine
Barrens and I'm with Rein.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.320
our sound man. Gee, Rein I'm pretty parched.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.260
I sure am, too.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.880
- Wow is that is that mulberry

38:17.880 --> 38:19.800
natural spring water?

38:19.800 --> 38:21.151
Yes from Mueller's.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.640
Wow, how about - I wish I could have a

38:23.640 --> 38:26.140
sparkling glass of that.

38:26.140 --> 38:28.780
Boy I'm telling you and in a gallon jar.

38:28.780 --> 38:29.720
Jug

38:29.720 --> 38:30.720
[host] the mood is good.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.920
Let's do that again.

38:32.160 --> 38:37.300
[host] Jim does not join them, instead staying in the tent on IRC.

38:39.120 --> 38:46.640
I don't really feel like I'm being taken
very seriously, by really any of you.

38:47.100 --> 38:51.660
I'm taking you seriously. We set up here you know.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.620
I'm doing what what I do and

38:56.620 --> 38:59.060
I don't appreciate being laughed at.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.340
Well it's just a stress thing.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.800
Look we're gonna be going on in a bit. You gonna come out for the broadcast?

39:12.120 --> 39:17.340
I think that I'll probably stay in here

39:19.660 --> 39:22.080
Stay on IRC

39:24.380 --> 39:28.020
At 10 p.m. in what will be the last broadcast,

39:28.500 --> 39:30.800
Fact or Fiction goes live.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.200
This is Johnny

39:33.200 --> 39:34.260
and Locus

39:34.560 --> 39:43.160
and we are live in the Pine Barrens where tonight we are doing a first ever, internet broadcast, cable...

39:48.320 --> 39:52.920
Jim has been on IRC for two hours and 30
minutes.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.740
A surveillance camera records the camp to VHS tape.

39:56.740 --> 40:00.240
It runs for 2 hours before shutting off.

40:00.240 --> 40:07.000
At 1:00 a.m. the last tape in the series of 22 tapes shot
by Locus Wheeler and Rein Clackin

40:07.000 --> 40:09.200
reaches its end.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.380
- Man, this thing's still on. What the hell's going on?

40:16.700 --> 40:19.420
Oh, I must have left it on. we should change tapes.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.940
Did you change tapes?
Here, I'm gonna change tapes in this.

40:21.940 --> 40:26.260
[host] There is no indication that this is done.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.220
No other footage exists.

40:48.700 --> 40:53.300
The tape show a group of men going
through a wide range of emotions.

40:53.300 --> 40:56.640
seemingly enjoying their jaunt into the
pine barrens.

40:58.040 --> 41:04.620
The tape shows the brooding nature of one man who does not share in the frivolity.

41:04.980 --> 41:10.760
The tapes do make clear the maladjusted nature of Jim Suerd.

41:12.460 --> 41:16.540
Though Suerd maintained his innocence,
the facts were indisputable.

41:17.820 --> 41:21.200
Four people went into the Pine Barrens, only Jim returned .

41:21.200 --> 41:24.360
Blood of all three was found on on Jim's shirt.

41:24.660 --> 41:27.360
Pushing Rein showed a
potential violent streak.

41:27.720 --> 41:32.910
The angle and depth of the cuts and lacerations matched somebody of his height and weight

41:32.910 --> 41:36.239
and more importantly ambidextrous nature.

41:36.239 --> 41:38.660
the number, which closely matched

41:38.669 --> 41:42.119
the date of the murders appearing
through ashes on his arm, was deemed to

41:42.119 --> 41:44.420
be a good case for premeditated murder.

41:44.420 --> 41:48.220
The tape showing the four walking further and further into the woods,

41:48.560 --> 41:51.660
virtually guaranteed a seclusion from civilization;

41:51.840 --> 41:54.559
civilization that would make the killing easier.

41:54.559 --> 41:56.909
the defense's one victory was

41:56.909 --> 42:01.140
getting a third charge of murder, the
murder of Steven Avkast, dropped.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.460
Though a body is not necessarily needed to prove a murder,

42:05.700 --> 42:09.360
the prosecution had more than enough evidence with the two bodies that were found.

42:10.100 --> 42:13.980
on July 16th 1996

42:13.980 --> 42:18.520
Jim Suerd was found guilty on two counts of first degree murder.

42:18.520 --> 42:23.540
He was sentenced to two life terms to be served consecutively.

42:27.000 --> 42:39.440
[guitar and singing] Went out with little Sadie and I shot it down, come back home, crawled into bed with a .44 pistol under my head.

42:39.720 --> 42:45.800
I think the whole trial was a kangaroo court of sorts, a pig circus.

42:46.460 --> 42:50.680
I mean it's there the police obviously didn't do their homework.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.400
They're not investigating to the best of their ability,

42:55.600 --> 42:58.760
because there has to be -

43:00.480 --> 43:07.200
There has to be some evidence indicating somebody else or something else.

43:07.200 --> 43:11.880
[jim singing]

43:12.560 --> 43:16.360
The case they built up against him, it was
all circumstantial.

43:16.920 --> 43:20.960
They didn't have any actual evidence that he did this but I mean he was the only one there.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.998
They really had no one else to go on.

43:22.998 --> 43:24.980
I don't consider having the blood of

43:24.980 --> 43:27.740
victims all over your clothes as circumstantial.

43:27.740 --> 43:30.590
I mean that's pretty hard evidence as
far as I'm concerned. You don't get blood

43:30.590 --> 43:35.990
on your clothes from a murder victim, you know, just out of the air.

43:35.990 --> 43:40.580
I mean, you have to be there conducting
those murders to get that blood on your clothes.

43:40.580 --> 43:45.000
I don't consider that circumstantial in the least.

43:46.920 --> 43:51.120
[Jim] and I can't explain that I can't explain
why

43:51.160 --> 43:53.520
there would be blood on my shirt.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.980
[detective] would you agree that it looks bad?

43:56.080 --> 43:56.780
[Jim] Excuse me?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.560
[detective] Would you agree that things don't look very
good for you right now?

43:59.920 --> 44:05.640
[Jim] I don't, I don't the way that you're telling me it doesn't look that good for me but I

44:05.640 --> 44:08.771
can't understand where this evidence came from.

44:08.780 --> 44:13.420
The evidence of blood on Jim's shirt was a strong point for the prosecution.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.620
DNA tests showed

44:15.620 --> 44:20.500
indisputably that it was the blood of
the three that had gone into the woods with Suerd.

44:20.960 --> 44:25.160
As I look at the images of DNA patterns and pools of blood, I wonder though

44:25.500 --> 44:30.960
if perhaps the jury anxious not to ignore DNA evidence as it happened in other trials.

44:30.960 --> 44:35.080
perhaps looked too closely.

44:35.080 --> 44:40.402
Through the magnifying glass of the prosecution's microscope, the evidence was solid.

44:40.402 --> 44:43.860
However a macroscopic view begged another question.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.980
Could the master of this orgy of violence have walked

44:46.980 --> 44:51.840
away from his work with merely the
equivalent of 17 I drops of blood on his shirt...

44:52.020 --> 44:53.340
and nothing else?

44:54.060 --> 44:56.660
you know, every piece of evidence they would get

44:56.670 --> 45:00.960
they'd try to tie it somehow, instead of thinking

45:00.960 --> 45:05.010
okay well gee, does this have anything to do with something else

45:05.010 --> 45:07.200
would always take a piece of evidence
and go -

45:07.480 --> 45:10.580
well gee how could Jimmy have used this?

45:10.580 --> 45:12.420
and it's kind of like, after a while, it's

45:12.700 --> 45:15.680
like building up a house of cards

45:15.690 --> 45:20.490
they just kept building up building up
and eventually they had enough built up

45:20.490 --> 45:22.600
to get a case against him.

45:24.120 --> 45:27.460
[Jim] I wasn't really monitoring there conduct outside of camp.

45:28.280 --> 45:29.480
I was doing my thing.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.360
[detective] what were you doing?

45:30.520 --> 45:31.680
[Jim] I was on the IRC.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.680
[detective] In the tent?

45:32.720 --> 45:33.300
[Jim] Yeah.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.260
[detective] All night?

45:34.500 --> 45:35.000
[Jim] all night

45:35.340 --> 45:37.640
[detective] About what time did you start on IRC?

45:40.080 --> 45:43.300
[Jim] Probably around that 8:30

45:43.800 --> 45:47.880
When we we've interviewed some of the individuals

45:48.100 --> 45:53.099
that mr. Suerd claimed to have been talking with on IRC that evening,

45:53.100 --> 45:59.280
and we've looked at their logs as well, too - their

45:59.280 --> 46:02.600
their uh their chat logs from their from their computers,

46:02.920 --> 46:05.400
and we have determined

46:05.400 --> 46:12.960
that there was about a 45 minute gap
between when mr. Suerd made one comment

46:13.480 --> 46:14.960
to when he made the next comment.

46:14.960 --> 46:19.100
and 45 minutes is an awfully long time to not

46:19.109 --> 46:22.220
be responding to other people on the Internet.

46:22.220 --> 46:27.780
They say this the the signal signal
dropped out so you know Jim

46:27.780 --> 46:31.340
could have walked away and I guess that
that is possible...

46:31.640 --> 46:33.254
It is possible, yes.

46:33.254 --> 46:38.339
You don't necessarily have to be a world-class sprint runner -

46:38.340 --> 46:42.680
- to cover that that amount of ground in 45 minutes.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.200
[gun shot]

47:02.440 --> 47:04.440
[modem dialing]

47:14.960 --> 47:20.720
In a way I have to raise doubts of this
one guy doing all that to these bodies.

47:20.760 --> 47:30.320
The the murdered pair, they were
darlings of the media.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.400
It was one of the reasons they jumped on this whole thing so quickly and had to come up with

47:35.400 --> 47:41.080
a conclusion of what happened was
just that: it was their very own.

47:41.480 --> 47:47.040
As professionals in law enforcement, we do not feel the pressure from outside sources,

47:47.040 --> 47:51.560
be at the media or otherwise to conduct our investigations.

47:52.080 --> 47:56.080
We conduct them to to the best of our ability at all times.

47:56.600 --> 48:01.880
There were no other suspects to apprehend or to interview or to consider.

48:02.480 --> 48:06.600
All the evidence pointed that Mr. Suerd was the only suspect

48:06.600 --> 48:09.640
and therefore all we had to do was gather

48:09.640 --> 48:18.360
the evidence to prove mr. Suerd's guilt. We did not have to gather evidence to gather other suspects.

48:23.520 --> 48:30.880
On January 2nd, 1997, an event occurred that forced me to rethink the making of this documentary -

48:31.400 --> 48:34.920
- the very thesis with which I had begun the journey.

48:35.400 --> 48:41.400
Jim Suerd was found dead in his jail of undetermined causes.

48:42.920 --> 48:48.480
On January 3rd, a package arrived at my
door which I think in no way was

48:48.480 --> 48:50.640
coincidental with the death of Jim
Suerd.

49:04.120 --> 49:11.240
The acquiring of mysterious video tape has changed the mood behind the making of this documentary.

49:11.260 --> 49:14.480
Gone is the attempt to pure objectivity with which we started.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.200
Now we question, who gave us this tape?

49:17.520 --> 49:21.440
And more importantly, what, if any information, does it hold

49:21.460 --> 49:23.720
that was never brought up in the trial?

49:23.720 --> 49:28.520
Going to the authorities with this new tape is pondered but rejected.

49:28.520 --> 49:33.440
To them the case is closed and with Jim's death, appeals are a moot point.

49:33.800 --> 49:37.280
Nothing is ruled out. The tape could be a hoax.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.880
I am conscious of one thing though.

49:40.880 --> 49:43.600
My search for the truth behind the Fact or
Fiction murders

49:44.040 --> 49:47.360
has in some way become part of the story.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.000
There was this discussion on the last tape that

49:51.200 --> 49:57.080
they were going to change tapes. But whether that ever happened or not...

49:57.920 --> 50:00.640
I don't know.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.280
I didn't see any other tapes and from what I saw of the camera

50:06.280 --> 50:10.800
it was pretty damaged. So if there was
any tape in there...

50:10.800 --> 50:14.840
I doubt that it ever could be played.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.480
My name is Michele Monarch.

50:22.680 --> 50:25.679
I'm a magnetic media data recovery specialist.

50:25.680 --> 50:31.400
The particular videotape that I was given was mangled almost beyond recognition.

50:32.040 --> 50:35.120
I digitized sections of this particular video,

50:35.120 --> 50:42.200
placed it into the computer and am now reconstructing the actual picture frame by frame.

50:42.680 --> 50:46.400
and I have to guide the
computer to complete these pictures

50:46.400 --> 50:50.760
there was some that were easily captured
by the computer.

50:50.760 --> 50:55.560
Others were unrecognizable, and I'm rebuilding them now at this time.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.720
As the tape is reassembled by Shelly,

51:04.720 --> 51:08.880
it becomes apparent that some sections are rather viewable.

51:23.560 --> 51:28.800
And I'll say, yeah I'm here, you know. I'm here while Locus is out hunting for the Jersey Devil.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.680
And I'll be like, "ah, shut up"

51:32.320 --> 51:34.320
Yeah, you can be like, "I don't see him."

51:34.920 --> 51:36.360
No, no, we better not do that because, we've got to deliver on this show.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.960
This is the big one here.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.320
Okay are we ready there, Rein?

51:44.640 --> 51:48.160
Do you want me to still be rolling on
this stuff, Steven?

51:49.840 --> 51:53.360
Do you want to state that that whole thing. I think I kind of could hear you.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.640
I've been rolling the camera just messing around shooting camp stuff but

51:56.640 --> 51:58.200
could you - what was the deal with

51:58.960 --> 52:01.920
I don't care if he hears this or not.
don't I mean this is never gonna make it

52:02.160 --> 52:07.360
anything but the cutting room floor as
they would say film days. From what Sam was saying.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.280
Sam, boy even he was ---

52:10.240 --> 52:13.240
I don't want to be like a bitch all night.

52:14.600 --> 52:19.240
I'm going to take a walk out into the woods and do a scout out of the location.

52:20.360 --> 52:25.280
I also have to go the bathroom.

52:26.320 --> 52:29.760
Get on the trumpet, do that sound.

52:30.800 --> 52:34.960
Newark's doing its thing.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.720
Yeah, I know the airplanes from Newark. but eah we got

52:36.720 --> 52:44.960
we got a little bit from that one machine going, but I want to see you working for the reason you're out here.

52:44.960 --> 52:48.840
And Locus, come on, 1R 144 double X awaits you.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.840
Do some work, man!

52:51.800 --> 52:55.000
Sure Steven, Anything you say, big guy.

52:56.120 --> 53:02.000
I'll be back in about ten minutes.

53:05.800 --> 53:10.160
Hey, do me a favor and switch that machine on.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.160
There goes a little tyrant.

53:15.280 --> 53:19.320
here, come on I got the camera roll and do a Steven imitation for me.

53:32.880 --> 53:38.840
Oh no I'm talking about Steven being a
pussy I'm not talking about Jim being a pussy.

53:40.200 --> 53:43.320
Jim's one psycho mother fuck-kahh..

53:43.600 --> 53:45.600
He's scary, man.

53:46.120 --> 53:48.600
Let me get that on camera.

53:49.160 --> 53:49.787
that thing isn't running, is it?

53:49.800 --> 53:52.800
Of course it's running. We're supposed to record everything.

53:53.560 --> 53:58.000
give me a Jim - why don't you do that line that you said..

54:00.040 --> 54:03.880
What did you think when he pushed you?

54:04.160 --> 54:11.160
[garbled sound]

54:12.160 --> 54:16.320
Iwas a little bit... I don't know was weird and kind of it freaked me out, man.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.400
I didn't really expect him to be violent. I thought it was like

54:19.520 --> 54:23.360
see that's what I don't get, man. He's like
totally like

54:23.800 --> 54:28.120
I thought he was like one of those guys like you know those peace, fucking meditation dudes or something....

54:31.320 --> 54:35.720
[host] Following these recorded moments, a large portion of the tape is smashed.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.760
It is a section that Shelley will attempt to restore.

54:40.800 --> 54:46.640
The next section that is immediately viewable, happens somewhere in the middle of the tape.

54:51.760 --> 54:57.960
The first thing that is apparent is that
this is tape shot by Locus and Rein.

54:57.960 --> 55:02.040
Steven is nowhere to be seen. They are
searching for him.

55:02.520 --> 55:06.840
on her third day of restoration shelley makes another discovery.

55:07.440 --> 55:10.720
The anonymous tape is not from one, but two cameras.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.880
Both Rein and Locus took cameras into the forest.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.560
Let me get the light up here.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.760
This is fact or fiction.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.080
we can't find Steven.

55:21.080 --> 55:24.360
Here we are in the Pine Barrens on a trip that he drug us out here for.

55:24.360 --> 55:30.560
We did a webcast, simulcast, cast cast cable cast that really was pretty poor if you ask me.

55:30.560 --> 55:35.390
But that doesn't matter at this point
because Steven, our main host, is missing.

55:35.390 --> 55:38.028
Johnny. Johnny. Johnny love is gone.

55:38.028 --> 55:40.680
He's gone and we can't find him.

55:40.680 --> 55:44.740
All I want to do is drink some beer.

55:44.980 --> 55:49.160
see this is for you Steven. Even though
we don't know where you are,

55:49.160 --> 55:54.160
we just want you to know that we're being really loyal to this whole "shoot everything".

56:02.870 --> 56:08.940
In the sixth day of her work, Shelly puts
together a stunning piece of tape.

56:08.940 --> 56:12.830
It is a moment in time that proves so much.

56:16.280 --> 56:19.640
Footprint... I think it goes off this way.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.280
Do you see anything over there?

56:24.280 --> 56:25.946
He's been gone for a while.

56:25.946 --> 56:27.920
Do you know what time it is?

56:27.920 --> 56:31.920
It's I think it's late it's like,

56:32.720 --> 56:35.400
Two... Forty Five.

56:36.440 --> 56:38.480
Rein and Locus were alive

56:38.480 --> 56:43.820
and speaking the time to one another and
they were supposed to be being killed

56:43.820 --> 56:47.560
and they're alive and they're saying the time on the video.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.610
To me that proves that

56:49.610 --> 56:52.480
Jim absolutely was not killing them at that time.

56:52.480 --> 56:58.550
Jim is an innocent man and this was not
investigated in any way shape or form.

56:58.550 --> 57:03.840
It was overlooked. So many details were overlooked.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.140
Also if he's an innocent man,

57:06.140 --> 57:09.840
there's a killer on the loose.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.960
Shelly's work slowly gives voices to the dead.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.840
Ghosts caught on video.

57:17.200 --> 57:26.440
[garbled sound]

57:27.120 --> 57:32.320
[garbled sound] why is he acting so weird?

57:33.240 --> 57:38.200
[garbled sound] I feel weird about it.

57:38.560 --> 57:58.800
[garbled] I feel weird about it. why didn't. you try to stop him going into the woods.

58:01.360 --> 58:05.360
The processing of the tape is quickly becoming more difficult for Shelley.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.400
Now only bits and pieces tell the story of what happened in the woods.

58:11.000 --> 58:17.400
On February 5th, Shelley presents a section of videotape that is nothing short of horrifying.

58:18.040 --> 58:21.200
It intensifies the question of who the killer is.

59:10.400 --> 59:17.480
On February 7th Shelley finds what she
thinks is the same moment in time from Locus's camera.

59:17.960 --> 59:20.880
It cannot however be viewed.

59:20.880 --> 59:25.480
She remains hopeful as she begins the process of trying to reconstruct a lost video.

59:26.280 --> 59:31.640
The computer needs me to direct it.
It doesn't know how to reconstruct a circle.

59:32.040 --> 59:37.640
maybe it would have an opening at the side and I have to teach it to continue the circle.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.840
I'm a guiding factor.

59:41.560 --> 59:45.520
While Shelley begins the process of attempting to restore video,

59:45.560 --> 59:50.160
I will attempt to find a truth within the
film I have already shot.

59:51.640 --> 59:57.560
In sitting there waiting for these video
edits to render, I did wonder about

59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.870
certain aspects of the case...

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.452
Sometimes I wonder, am i doing the right thing?

01:00:05.452 --> 01:00:07.760
Did this guy do it?

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.160
It seemed to me, from all what I
saw, that you know it was pretty likely

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.120
that he did it.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.360
I mean you had the blood evidence and stuff like that,

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.760
But there was that the one guy that they never found his body.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.560
What happened to him? I mean, could he have done it? I don't know.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.800
It is an obvious question.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.760
A question I had presented to all the people interviewed.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.520
The tape restoration is showing Locus
and Rein searching for Steven,

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.120
which only makes the question more relevant.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.400
What happened to Steven Avkast?

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.440
By process of elimination, I proceed.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.840
We did find some blood and of course the infamous Johnny hat that was found.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.150
We were never able to find any more remains.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.880
of that person so we don't know if he's
dead or alive.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.640
They never found Steven's body, Johnny - but they found his hat.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.520
So, I mean, I don't know. it's just weird that the only thing left of him is...

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.200
a hat?

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:26.320
All right I'll be back in about ten minutes. okay man, I'll be on that before we get back

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:36.480
we don't think that Mr. Avkast would be able to set up mr. Suerd because the amount of blood that we found

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.800
Of Mr. Avkast is so great that he would have bled to death trying to set Mr. Suerd up.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.560
There goes the little tyrant.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.800
oh whoa

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.480
check it out. Shine that over there.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.533
Oh Wow, what's that?

01:01:53.533 --> 01:01:54.480
I don't know, man.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.840
Looks like a light.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.560
Yo, it's Steven's light.
Yo Steve!

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.040
Steven!!!

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.950
[host] In finding that Jim's alibi holds up, we have to attempt to answer the question raised:

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.600
who killed these people?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.200
The likely suspect would appear to be Steven.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.480
As I watch these frames though, I see no
recognition in Locus's face.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.080
I see Locus, a man larger than Steven, turn tail and run.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.960
As does Rein.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.000
Steven Avkast, being the culprit of the horrendous massacre that took place in the minutes that follow this tape

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.320
is impossible to believe.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.120
Aong with the amount of blood that belongs to Steve Avkast,

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.520
this makes me believe that he also was murdered in the Pine Barrens.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.680
I am now also of the belief

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.320
that the killer was somehow something more horrendous than possible to imagine.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.200
what could have killed three healthy men?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.080
What would have left no footprints?

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:14.640
What would have torn the men into forty seven pieces,leaving no evidence of a struggle?

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.800
We could tell by what was a left in the infliction of the wound that it was

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.400
a serrated type weapon, that much we know.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.600
there were noknife fragments or

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:32.400
any evidence of the actual weapon used
other than the cuts themselves well

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.800
We're a rural County, we have people who
are not greatly educated.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.360
Rumors and folklore are common.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.080
I put no credence in anything of that nature.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.440
I just go by the facts that the police are able to ascertain.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.520
A monster?

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.680
Yeah, I think this person's a monster. I don't believe

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.320
fact or fiction. I don't believe the fiction.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.480
I think this is a person and I'm gonna find out who it is.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:13.480
I'm gonna reconstruct and do my job to recover what has been lost -- the facts.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.880
it is as though the Jersey Devil is a monster reborn in a digital age.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.880
Reborn on the Internet.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.160
a demon captured on IRC logs, mangled
video, whispers in the dark.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.080
It is to these that I look.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.320
it's totally anonymous I mean you can't trace a call

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.440
You don't know if it's man, woman, old, young.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.320
you don't know anything you don't know where it's from.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.920
I mean in one way I don't know

01:04:41.929 --> 01:04:45.799
why the cops didn't try to do anything
you know and try to figure out

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.560
Well who made that idea?
Who came up with that suggestion?

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.240
[robot voice] Why don't you do a show about the Jersey Devil?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.240
we have this show Fact or Fiction.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.079
It's a paranormal variety show.
you know we have guests come on,

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.200
That kind of thing. Well, things have kind of been a little slow over at station,

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.280
the station so we thought what we would
do is we'd we'd make a little excursion

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:20.640
there was a suggestion, via IRC,.....

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.760
and also to the mail bag.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:24.800
Yeah.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.720
That guy, D something. Whatever his name was.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.040
One thing about IRC really hard is that -

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.760
It really is hard to trace it because, I
mean, it's not like like you know

01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:37.182
the phone number they're calling from.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.840
I mean this could have been like Shanghai

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.640
where they were writing this message from.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.840
You just don't know.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.840
That's part of the beauty and part of the evil of it.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:54.280
[Modem sounds]

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.200
it is amazing to be so near

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.080
yet so far from the possibility of knowing who the killer is.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.760
D something.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.160
we thought what we would do

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.920
is we'd we'd make a little excursion.
there was a suggestion, via IRC, to -

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.440
and also from that mail bag.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.380
yeah

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.480
that guy D something whatever his name was.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.200
it's just not practical to keep logs to
that stuff. I get so much email, so much

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:32.080
it would just clog up my system. I erased
it as we went along. I mean, once a job

01:06:32.099 --> 01:06:35.385
once a point got finished I killed the email, got rid of it.

01:06:35.385 --> 01:06:36.480
it was it was like a to-do list.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.040
I check it off, I get rid of this stuff.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.440
So, once things weren't pertinent anymore, I just get rid of them.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.840
So I don't have anything of it really.

01:06:44.849 --> 01:06:49.680
I mean there there were like a couple of
emails that we had at the very end there

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.200
But there's nothing illuminating there.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:28.480
it gets harder and harder to stick with
your original gut feeling.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.550
Because of the media, you know. The attention that the whole case is getting,

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:46.640
how one-sided, lopsided the whole thing is.
and you start to think,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.080
maybe

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:55.960
Maybe he did do it. Maybe there's a side of Jim that I don't know that

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.440
that was capable of such atrocity.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.640
As this journey nears its end,

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.080
I begin to fully understand the essence of what this is about.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.320
the media upon which these events were recorded.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.070
the media that should have been able to provide a truth

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.600
more pure than ever before, has somehow
become the story.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.479
This has become more than a search for the truth behind the Fact or Fiction murders.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:26.100
it has become an indictment of truth and how it is viewed through the lens of the media.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:31.589
[Steven] Pretty exciting moment here because the fact or fiction logo is on screen

01:08:31.589 --> 01:08:33.520
which means one thing.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.649
that we are now actually getting our

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:42.279
feed live to the cable company

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:45.990
[host] Reality television, the news,

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:50.370
The 60-second clip of truth, have made even the strongest of doubters wonder...

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:53.840
Are you a psychic or a psycho?

01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.720
Look man I'll see you back at camp.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.920
What did you say to him?

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.670
wait what do you mean he's gonna be
where we can't go -- Where the hell is the camp?

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.799
this is the whole fucking thing where
the hell is the camp?

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:12.999
We can't lose him.

01:09:12.999 --> 01:09:14.205
well, we're losing him.

01:09:14.205 --> 01:09:18.479
go find a man I'm not gonna go anywhere near him fucking asshole, man.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.040
just cut the damn camera already.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.760
What is the truth? The editing process -
it's like sifting that stuff out

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:36.720
ultimately, I mean not necessarily with
these legal videos, but with a

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:42.040
documentary film, I mean ultimately it's
what the filmmaker perceives as the truth.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.920
I mean, don't you think - that's what
you're trying to do right?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.484
The mistakes that were discovered on this journey were stunning.

01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:52.640
shoddy police work and a judgmental video

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.600
presented the world with a person guilty before ever being tried.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.080
I know Jim is not guilty.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.240
I know that the truth is still at large,

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.320
potentially closer than anyone can
realize.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.280
it is as though the real killer planned a media event so amazingly cunning

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.000
that it could be thought of as scripted.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.510
A kill ready for primetime, so to speak.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.579
Perhaps the demon we call the Jersey
Devil did kill them in the Pine Barrens.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.720
But if so, the Jersey Devil is the
electronic image,

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.720
the sound

01:10:25.739 --> 01:10:27.680
The communication to the masses,

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.200
Somehow twisted into a surrealist electronic world.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.880
I always asked the question last: Do you Jim did it?

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.680
And with the exception of authorities directly accountable to the answer,

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.560
I have felt that the answer given has been -
it doesn't matter.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.560
The truth is what time has made of this event.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.040
it has been good for business. Often murder is.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.520
so many involved benefited from this
event.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.480
The inevitable book deal is being replaced with a career in the business of image control.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.040
And most of the people interviewed are ready to embrace it.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.960
I guess a grim irony here, as these post-its can attest,

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:17.200
the fact that when we have some real
dead bodies, then the sharks start circling.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:26.760
Strange that an incident like that would be a prelude

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.400
to a new phase in my career.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.240
It's interesting, after the court case was over

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.380
with all the publicity and everything
surrounding it, you know, I started

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:42.080
getting the phone calls for a couple job
leads. I mean, you know, so in one way,

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.560
This might have helped me out of here.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.560
[host] How long will it take to process the entire tape?

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.340
it's not my intention to process the whole tape.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.480
I don't need to do that.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.280
it could take hours, it could take days.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.120
I need to process a particular piece of tape

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.120
that could potentially reveal a killer.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.320
Shelley continues to extrapolate
information from a frame

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.400
While I will reenact the events of December 15 1995

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.440
This is one of the stops that the guys
made on the way to the pine barrens.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.160
I know this because of the extensive
documentary footage that they had taken take of this place.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.320
I don't know what good this will do.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.320
I think it's just to keep myself clear on wha happened.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.720
You know the order of events.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.840
Strangely the weather is almost identical to the way it was that day.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.350
I'm now travelling an access route that
I know Steven and Locus had taken.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.078
for the Jersey Devil Project.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.000
We're in the midst of the Pine Barrens at this point.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.120
and what I'm hoping to do is see if I can't do a recreation of the campsite,

01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:20.001
Perhaps the murder scene.

01:13:20.001 --> 01:13:23.800
Hopefully traversing this won't be too big of a problem.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.903
I'm using this video camera just as a matter of convenience.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:31.680
Using film out here with prove to be logistically too difficult.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:40.040
Hopefully we can get you some good footage and really try demonstrate -

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.640
The intrepid nature of Steven and Locus.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.470
I feel with some more work that I will find the killer.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.640
I will see the face of the killer.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:59.720
[Music]

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.840
This site is a very close approximation
of the one used by Steven and Locus on

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840
the night of the Jersey Devil episode.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.160
They'd chosen a clearing similar to this one as base camp for the telecast.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.360
When they ventured onto the Pine Barrens with their cameras,

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.480
they would never return alive again.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.960
The documentary footage that generated on that evening proves irrevocably,

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.240
that Jim Suerd was not responsible for their murders.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.720
That Locus and Rein Clackin were actually alive at the time they were ostensibly killed.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.080
and that the police case was shoddy at best.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.360
what is the Jersey Devil?

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.760
it's a man wandering into the Pine Barrens never to be seen again.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.400
It's a mangled animal found on one of these access roads.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.440
Or perhaps it's something that rests within our psyche and we'll never truly understand.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.120
I've been on this project for months now and haven't come to a clear definition

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.960
of what actually happened or who was responsible.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.920
All I know is that it's a mystery and it may permanently remain so.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.600
What is the Jersey Devil?

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.520
I'm now outside of Shelley's studio.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.640
All the media.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.320
all the interviews

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.040
the truth comes down to this one frame.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.620
I've determined that this is no time to
be distracted or set aside in the course

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.660
of the events that I've set into motion.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.540
My next step will be going to the Pine Barrens

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.520
for a reenactment of the murders of Steven Avkast and Locus Wheeler and Rein Clackin.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.420
I'm as strong in my resolve as before and improving that Jim Suerd

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.080
was not responsible for these murders.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.700
That he had neither the intellect nor the logical capacity to carry them through.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:31.900
I think that the replayment of our events here will be quite compelling in the demonstration of

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.600
Suerd's innocence.
