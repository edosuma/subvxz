Damn it, Zach. This is the last time
I'm turning around.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.783
The next time you forget something,
you're gonna be on your own.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.286
Then I guess
you won't play.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.997
I don't care.
I suck anyway.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.165
Don't say that.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.333
I'm the worst guy
on the whole team.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.460
- No, you're not.
- Then who's worse?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.505
Don't worry about anyone else,
just do your best.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.964
See? You can't
name anyone.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.841
Zach, stop it.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.259
Then name someone.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.596
You can't, can you?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.728
Donny, Mark, Navid...

01:43.104 --> 01:45.397
You really think
I'm better than those guys?

01:45.523 --> 01:46.524
Yes.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.740
Hurry up and
get your stick.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.385
Zach, get back
in the car.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.846
I need an ambulance
at 860 Oakwood Avenue.

02:16.971 --> 02:17.930
Why is Dad's car on?

04:14.922 --> 04:18.175
I was up all night
looking at finance reports,

04:18.300 --> 04:21.720
and Rachel is doing great,
thanks for asking.

I've got some
time next decade...

04:29.311 --> 04:31.313
Cameron already
turned yours in.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.857
That's nice of her.

04:33.983 --> 04:37.069
Two questions, why did she,
and why are you telling me?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.363
Same answer.
Now you owe her a favor.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.366
I'm gonna need an extension.
I've got some time...

04:42.491 --> 04:45.202
House, I've got a DYFS
home visit on Friday.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.204
And I've got
a W-H-O-R-E visit on...

04:47.329 --> 04:48.247

I was expecting something involving
whipped cream and tongue depressors.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.308
He's seen seven different
specialists over three years,

05:07.433 --> 05:08.976
no diagnosis and no relief.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.479
Oh, I am fascinated already.
It's like I'm treating myself.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.690
He gets cured, and I get to learn
a valuable lesson

05:14.815 --> 05:15.899
about the milk of
human kindness.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.027
If I thought you learned lessons,
I never would have quit.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.570
So you're wasting
a favor because...

05:19.695 --> 05:21.363
I think you can help this guy.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.657
Drug-seeking patients...

05:23.782 --> 05:27.661
Don't attempt suicide with medicine
cabinets full of narcotics.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.121
Sounds like fibromyalgia.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.749
Sounds like you
don't work for House.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.834
A diagnosis that provides
neither an explanation nor a cure

05:33.959 --> 05:35.711
is, by definition,
not a diagnosis.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.047
The American College of Rheumatology
would disagree.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.631
There're specific
diagnostic criteria...

05:39.757 --> 05:40.841
Which this guy
doesn't meet.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.469
Putting pressure on his pain helps,
doesn't make it worse.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.637
He's got abdominal pain,
severe headaches,

05:45.763 --> 05:46.930
muscle cramps that come and go.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.307
And he tried
to off himself.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.809
He's, obviously, mentally ill.
The pain's probably psychological.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.312
It's not a sign of mental illness
to wanna be pain-free.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.647
It is if your solution
is sucking on a tailpipe.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.733
Sane people don't attempt suicide.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.984

06:01.445 --> 06:03.238

I'd shoot the guys
with the torches.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.660
Not one doctor this guy's seen
in the past three years

06:08.786 --> 06:10.621
has been able to find a single thing
wrong with him.

06:10.746 --> 06:11.705
What does that tell you?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.165
It means they're idiots.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.084
It means we got to
start from the beginning.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.170
And do a pain profile to
rule out psychosomatic pain.

06:18.295 --> 06:23.926

Get a refill. And a donut.

I know what I did was stupid.

trouble with sleep.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.751
I have a lot of trouble.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.003
It's up and down.

07:00.129 --> 07:03.715
Between the pain and the meds,
his sleep pattern's pretty erratic.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.593
"He's a calm person. He's more nervous
than most people.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.220
"He's so nervous
he's miserable."

07:08.345 --> 07:10.180
He's definitely calm.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.183
Sometimes calmer
the worse the pain gets.

07:14.476 --> 07:18.564
I think talking, interacting with other
people, actually makes it worse.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.773
Interesting.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.442
Why, does that
mean something?

07:21.567 --> 07:23.527
No, it's just...

07:23.652 --> 07:27.322
We've seen that
in other patients.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.741
TAUB: "He can do chores
around the house.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.412
"With help he can do chores.
He no longer can do chores."

07:33.537 --> 07:34.955
ZACH: He helps all the time.

07:35.747 --> 07:40.669
He's really strong. He used to play
hockey. He was really good, too.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.089
"I believe there's hope.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.925
Hoping for things to get
better is a struggle for me.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.970
"Most of the time
I feel completely hopeless."

07:50.095 --> 07:53.891
He still laughs,
all the time.

07:54.016 --> 07:59.730
LYNNE: He was always optimistic.
Still is. It's just, it's harder now.

08:00.939 --> 08:05.360
I guess I pray for
strength more than hope.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.535
There's nothing in there but a
pharmacy's worth of pain meds.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.330
This guy makes House look
like a Christian Scientist.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.333
He's also more compliant than House.
Kept all the inserts.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.920
Had daily pill dispensers
to make sure he didn't mix them up.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.298
Guess if you're gonna go out in a car,
this ain't a bad one to choose.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.426
If I ever did it, it definitely
wouldn't be like that.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.554
Don't worry,
I'm not making any plans.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.639
I certainly wouldn't know.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.641
Ever since we kissed,
you've been avoiding me.

08:35.766 --> 08:39.102
No, I haven't.
I've just been busy.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.897
Metal polish could cause nerve damage,
if he inhaled enough of it.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.608
And judging by the shine on that car,
he used a fair amount.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.195
And judging by the fact that he owns
a body shop, and one of these,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.072
I'd say he knew
not to inhale.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.617
Busy tonight?
We could get some dinner.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.453
I don't think so.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.748
So, making out, okay,
meals, too intimate?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.125
I don't wanna kiss
you again, either.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.752
Why? Because
we work together?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.713
No. Because I like you.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.550
That makes a lot of sense.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.761
What doesn't make sense is me getting
involved with anyone.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.557
I thought you'd gotten past that. That's
why you agreed to the drug trial.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.724
You can't give up
on life because...

09:17.849 --> 09:21.728
I'm not giving up on life,
I'm just giving up on you.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.983

on things, I can handle this.

else down with me.

quail to you?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.623
TAUB: You think he's had food poisoning
every day for the last three years?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.459
THIRTEEN: Wild quail can be toxic,
cause rhabdomyolysis,

09:44.585 --> 09:47.129
which would explain his pain as well as
the elevated CK levels.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.631
So would the carbon monoxide
he sucked out of his car.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.010
It's not a toxic reaction,
it's a psychosomatic reaction.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.680
The pain profile showed an excessive
concern about his physical health,

09:56.805 --> 09:58.307
difficulty sleeping,
getting out of bed...

09:58.432 --> 10:00.058
He's not in pain
because he's depressed,

10:00.183 --> 10:02.060
he's depressed
because he's in pain.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.272
Not according to the pain profile
you ordered. It's not a diet issue.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.567
We should start him on antidepressants,
for his sake as well as his family's.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.860
We're not diagnosing
his family.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.112
We're not diagnosing
you, either.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.866
It's rhabdo.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.577
Push IV fluids, check his urine,
do a muscle biopsy.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.204
What muscle?
He says it hurts all over.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.165
Then she'll
biopsy all over.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.418
Where are you going?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.587
If Cuddy can come in late,
I can leave early.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.757
If you need anything while I'm gone,
just ask Cameron to do it.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.596
So if he just stops eating quail,
the pain will go away?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.473
If we're right,
it's definitely treatable.

He's not answering
his cell, either.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.771
V-Q scan showed
a pulmonary embolism.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.564
Means the pain's
not psychosomatic.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.566
Also means it's
not rhabdomyolysis.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.820
Up till now his heart and lungs were
the only places he didn't have pain.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.488
Means it's getting worse.

- How'd you know he had a...
- Call after midnight,

11:46.998 --> 11:50.627
it's gotta be a heart problem. Heart
only would be consistent with rhabdo,

11:50.836 --> 11:53.296
which means Thirteen and Foreman
would be singing in the rain,

11:53.422 --> 11:54.715
which means it has
to be lungs as well.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.300

could cause pain and a PE.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.184
Explains blood clots, multi-focal pain,
lack of obvious physical signs...

12:06.309 --> 12:08.979
And why he's gone three years
without anyone seeing it.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.857
Check his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis for tumors.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.194

would be singing in the rain?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.940
Saying I wouldn't do it
under any circumstances

13:35.065 --> 13:36.733
means my whole
family was suicidal?

13:36.858 --> 13:40.195
No. But categorically
insisting there are no circumstances

13:40.320 --> 13:43.198
means you've got baggage,

14:26.366 --> 14:27.742
I wouldn't
want to look elitist.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.328
Can't do anything till
I write up an estimate.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.668
Fine. Pad it all you want.
Here's a check for the deductible.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.628
Don't touch the piano,
and lock up when you leave.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.756
Sorry, deductible
doesn't apply here.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.510
I'm no architect,
but I'm pretty sure the master bedroom

14:45.635 --> 14:47.721
is part of the home,
which means the home warranty...

14:47.929 --> 14:49.389
Doesn't cover negligence.

14:49.806 --> 14:54.477
This pipe goes through the ceiling,
over that wall and into your shower.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.563
It didn't burst,
it was pulled apart.

14:56.730 --> 15:01.276
Yeah, 'cause I'm clearly a guy who likes
to knock out a few naked pull-ups

15:01.401 --> 15:02.444
before I greet the day.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.945
You hang laundry in there?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.614
I'm about to hang
a plumber in there.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.576
Look, there's no rust,
there's no corrosion.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.745
I don't know how it happened,
but I know what happened,

15:11.870 --> 15:13.455
and it's not covered.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.375
So, whenever you're ready
to spend the $2,200,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.294
give somebody else a call.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.308
I promise, I'm only holding your hand
to check for choreiform movement.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.060
I'm getting absolutely
no intimacy from it.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.479
I told you, it has
nothing to do with you.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.648
I know.
That's the problem.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.068
There's 80 reasons we shouldn't date.
But you can't shut everyone out.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.070
You're gonna
need help, support.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.198
Look at our patient.
Thirty-two years old, not dead yet,

15:48.323 --> 15:50.992
and already
he's traumatized his wife, his son...

15:51.117 --> 15:53.912
And I'll bet they're cherishing every
traumatic minute he has left,

15:54.037 --> 15:55.664
wouldn't trade him
for the healthiest guy in the world.

15:55.789 --> 16:00.293
True. And they're stuck suffering
with him, hating every day,

16:00.418 --> 16:03.380
only their pain has
no prospect of relief.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.589
This a bad time?

16:04.714 --> 16:05.715
- No.
- Yes.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.301
No trace of cancer
in the patient.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.136
But we did find edema
in his intestines,

16:10.261 --> 16:12.764
air in the intestinal blood vessels,
and House won't answer his phone.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.475
His intestine must be damaged,
the air's leaking into his body.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.936
If there's a blockage
in the superior mesenteric artery,

16:18.061 --> 16:19.604
it could be
choking off blood flow to his intestine.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.940
Blockages all over his body
would explain his pain,

16:22.065 --> 16:23.525
why the cramps come and go.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.777
Do an angioplasty
on the superior mesenteric,

16:25.902 --> 16:28.613
and find the other blockages,
before he has another cardiac arrest.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.073
I'll help.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.256
Good thing we don't
have a suicidal patient

16:46.381 --> 16:48.425
with a horrific,
undiagnosed pain disorder.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.385
We did,
till we diagnosed it.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.346
We found intestinal edema
and air in the blood vessels.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.347
The pain was vascular.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.725
If it was vascular,
we would've seen uneven pulses.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.602
His blood pressure was uneven.
Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.521
He'd have hemorrhages
in his fingers.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.524
There's air in the intestine,
it has to have come from somewhere.

17:07.485 --> 17:10.947
Yes, it does.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.119
After we thread the catheter
through his groin and into position,

17:16.244 --> 17:17.662
the blood will start
flowing freely again.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.622
Will that take
away the pain?

17:19.748 --> 17:24.419
It will be completely ineffective,
and the pain will completely go away.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.546
- Cancel the angio.
- He has air in his blood vessels.

17:26.671 --> 17:27.964
If we don't open
the artery to his intestine...

17:28.089 --> 17:29.716
Where can air come from?

17:30.717 --> 17:31.718
Hmm.

17:32.135 --> 17:35.513
Air can either come from a breach
of the lumen in the small intestine,

17:35.638 --> 17:40.310
or, in rare instances,
air can come from the air.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.104
Teeth marks.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.857
I'm guessing from
when he blew into his IV tube.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.568
Air bubble caused
the PE and cardiac arrest.

17:48.693 --> 17:52.197
You tried to finish the job
that you started at home.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.742
Jeff, why?
You said that...

17:55.867 --> 17:57.452
I lied.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.123
I want to die.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.546
Please just let me die.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.300
No.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.688
KUTNER: He's in
a hyperbaric chamber.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.857
A dose of high pressure ought
to chase the air out of his blood.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.317
CUDDY: Is anyone
keeping an eye on him?

18:29.442 --> 18:32.153
You know, because
the whole idea of suicide watch

18:32.278 --> 18:35.657
was specifically created
for suicidal patients.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.243
I realize how you might have thought
the name was just a coincidence...

18:38.368 --> 18:39.369
Are there any
visuals in this room

18:39.494 --> 18:43.414
that are key to us learning our lesson?
Because the telephone...

18:43.540 --> 18:46.793
I'm inconveniencing you
because you inconvenienced me.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.002
(BABY GURGLING)

18:48.128 --> 18:49.420
When was the last
time you showered?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.631
Scent of a man.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.758
I realize you haven't
experienced it sober.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.511
If anyone should be able to handle
a depressed pain patient...

18:56.636 --> 18:58.096
He insisted
he was no longer...

18:58.221 --> 18:59.639
Apparently, he lied.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.892
Didn't think I'd have to remind
you of that remote possibility.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.521
I have a DYFS inspection in less than
24 hours, so if you can't control...

19:06.646 --> 19:07.730
Non-motor seizures.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.694
Sorry, I was thinking about the patient.
What were you saying?

19:13.903 --> 19:15.572
- Go on.
- The pain started in his abdomen,

19:15.697 --> 19:18.116
near his intestine.
The first symptom's got to be key.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.701
HOUSE: He's had multiple EEGs,

19:19.826 --> 19:23.413
all of them cleaner and squeakier
than Cuddy's rubber nipples.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.499
What about a glycogen-storage
disease, like McArdle's.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.458
Explains the pain,

19:27.584 --> 19:30.545
plus there's plenty of muscle cells
in the wall of the intestine.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.634
Foreteen is right.
Go run an ischemic forearm test.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.430
Take the garbage
out on your way out.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.727
If you want a man to take your crap,
you have to marry him first.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.270
Or employ him.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.941
Good girl.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.529
I don't think I'm ready
to run a decathlon yet.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.616
If we can get you managing your life
a bit better, that'll be plenty.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.492
Dr. Hadley,
whenever you're ready.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.660
Janice.

20:02.785 --> 20:03.745
(CHUCKLES)

20:04.454 --> 20:05.538
You look better.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.541
Yeah, they said my basal ganglia
volume's improved.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.501
All I know is,
for the first time in two years,

20:10.627 --> 20:13.838
I can drink a cup of water
without spilling it all over myself.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.342
Thank you for getting me
back in the study.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.178
I haven't even
seen you in weeks,

20:20.303 --> 20:23.139
I didn't even know our appointments
were back-to-back again.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.184
Well, they weren't.
Mine got switched this morning.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.313
We're gonna take
your blood repeatedly.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.440
If the increased strain
makes your arm hurt more,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.359
you have a muscle abnormality.

20:34.484 --> 20:38.780
If you're right about this McArdle's
disease, can you take away the pain?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.198
With gene replacement therapy,

20:40.323 --> 20:42.617
with lifestyle changes,
we can reduce it.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.285
Keep squeezing
the ball.

20:45.036 --> 20:45.995
(GRUNTS)

20:46.120 --> 20:46.955
How long does he have to...

20:47.080 --> 20:48.373
Maybe you and Zach
should eat something.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.499
LYNNE: Honey,
don't worry about us.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.000
I'm not.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.629
Please, get out of here.
These tests are all I can handle.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.053
TAUB: They're trying
to help you.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.388
They can't.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.974
Then how about helping them?
You know, by not being...

21:06.099 --> 21:08.768
An ass? You have no idea
what I'm going through.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.688
I know it's better than
what you tried to go through.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.733
Sure, no baggage at all.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.152
- Where's the pain worst right now?
- In my left arm.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.821
- Does it hurt more?
- Couldn't.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.198
And lactate level's steady.
It's not any kind of glycogen...

21:22.323 --> 21:26.869
(SCREAMING) Oh, God! Pain jumped to
my leg. This never happened before.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.580
Your chest, your abdomen,
you feel anything there?

21:29.706 --> 21:33.418
My leg feels like
it's been sawed off.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.425
- Nice.
- What?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.303
Switching Janice's appointment time,
so I can see the skies brighten

21:43.428 --> 21:45.221
- like a Lifetime TV movie.
- I don't know what you're...

21:45.346 --> 21:48.308
Sticking your most improved study
participant in my face.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.351
Is that your way of
getting into my pants?

21:51.519 --> 21:56.024
I don't make the schedule, and if I did,
I wouldn't use it as a social lubricant.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.569
And this is the first
I've heard of Janice improving at all.

21:59.694 --> 22:02.405
So, hey, thanks
for the good news.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.371
Pain started
in his abdomen.

22:10.496 --> 22:14.167
Now it's hopped from his left arm to his
left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.336
- I need the name of a good lawyer.
- We're getting sued?

22:16.461 --> 22:18.129
Probably.
That's Cuddy's problem.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.965
Hopping pain. Means it's something
in his brain, not his body.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.592
Except the pain's in two places

22:22.717 --> 22:25.178
that connect two separate regions
of the brain,

22:25.303 --> 22:27.555
which means you're
not using yours.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.308
Come on, you're from one
of the Twelve Tribes,

22:30.433 --> 22:31.934
you must know
a ton of shysters.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.144
What type of lawyer
do you need?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.730
I'll bring it up at the next world
domination subcommittee meeting.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.484
I didn't say I needed a lawyer, I said I
needed the name of a lawyer.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.653
Pain hopped to another limb on the same
side, it's gotta be central...

22:42.779 --> 22:45.239
Could still be peripheral.
If multiple areas of disc disease...

22:45.365 --> 22:48.993
Were consistent with
a completely spotless MRI.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.121
Who represented the hospital when you
set that patient on fire?

22:52.246 --> 22:53.414
Chris Carrick.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.166
Chris.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.001
That doesn't sound like
a very good lawyer.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.795
If we can't even resolve
body versus brain,

22:58.920 --> 23:00.254
we're never gonna diagnose the guy.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.547
What was the
name of the firm?

23:01.672 --> 23:02.507
Caddell and Carrick.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.676
It's not like we can chop off his head
to see if the pain goes away.

23:09.347 --> 23:10.473
Why not?

23:18.689 --> 23:20.149
(DOOR OPENS)

23:21.567 --> 23:23.528

a guy's head.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.114
Gotta figure out if
his pain's

23:26.239 --> 23:27.949
coming from
his brain or his body.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.701
Stiff shot of Lidocaine
below the brain stem

23:30.827 --> 23:32.620
should numb him all the way down
to his tippy-toes.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.123
And hearing me say "no" over the phone
wasn't good enough?

23:35.248 --> 23:38.918
I'm inconveniencing you because you
inconvenienced me.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.003
You know that foster care official
is coming in the morning...

23:41.129 --> 23:42.797
If they weren't
there'd be no inconvenience.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.842
Do not try and force me
to choose between my child and this...

23:45.967 --> 23:47.510
I'm forcing you
to do your job.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.431
- If you can't also...
- Fine.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.933
You want to separate
a patient's central nervous system

23:54.058 --> 23:55.059
from the rest
of his body.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.937
If the pain stays, it's in his brain.
If it vanishes...

23:58.104 --> 23:59.480
What about options three,
four and five?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.858
His respiratory system freezes,
or he dies of infection,

24:01.983 --> 24:03.776
or he leaks CNS fluid
like a fire hydrant,

24:03.901 --> 24:05.445
which would
make him wish he were dead.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.655
Scratch option five,
he's already there.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.576
You preach objectivity, but as soon
as a patient comes in, in pain,

24:11.701 --> 24:13.244
all you want to do is
look under the hood.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.329
You don't care if there's a one-in-three
chance you'll kill him.

24:15.455 --> 24:19.250
If I don't diagnose him, there's a
one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.285
when I still thought
I had good days left.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.579
Turns out you have
to live to find out.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.331
JEFF: You don't have
a family, do you?

25:40.456 --> 25:42.208
Left them all back
on Krypton.

25:43.793 --> 25:47.630
You're alone.
That's why you can handle your pain.

25:47.755 --> 25:51.592
No need to put up a front,
to be what anyone else wants you to be.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.429
You're having more
bad days lately, aren't you?

25:57.348 --> 25:58.724
Yes.

I really wasn't
expecting you till later.

26:18.035 --> 26:21.038
Had a cancellation, so I thought
I'd knock you off the docket.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.582
Well, I'm sorry this place
is such a mess,

26:22.707 --> 26:24.458
it's been a bit
of a difficult work week.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.711
- Any guns in the house?
- No.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.341
- Pets? Besides the ants?
- No.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.268
Nice bag. Pricey way
to ditch the diapers.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.313
That's not what I usually...
I sort of panicked.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.982
Mr. Carlton, if you'll just give me
a minute to explain...

26:48.107 --> 26:50.067
Everything looks fine.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.485
Really?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.946
Dr. Cuddy, you've got
sufficient income,

26:54.071 --> 26:57.158
a high degree of personal
and professional stability,

26:57.283 --> 27:00.453
and you care enough to be embarrassed
by what a mess this place is.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.330
Believe me, that puts you
head and shoulders

27:02.455 --> 27:04.749
above most of
the foster moms I visit.

27:04.874 --> 27:08.044

adopted her by then.

My legs, they're
different, better.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.057
- No pain at all?
- No, but less.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.975
Four out of 10,
maybe five.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.478
Can't be.

27:26.437 --> 27:30.274
If whatever's causing the pain's
in your brain, it's still a 10.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.069
In your periphery, a zero.

27:33.194 --> 27:36.405
It is. Some of the pain
is gone, but not all of it.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.659
What does this mean?

27:43.954 --> 27:47.583
Maybe Taub was right,
it's psychosomatic after all.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.379
Which one of
you is House?

27:51.504 --> 27:52.630
The big black guy.

27:57.385 --> 28:00.680
Chris Carrick. Next time you use
my name in a threatening e-mail,

28:00.805 --> 28:03.474
it won't be just a bill,
it'll be a lawsuit.

28:09.730 --> 28:13.401
Can you blame me? Last time that
happened, the guy shot me.

28:13.526 --> 28:16.278
What if the spinal block triggered
some sort of placebo effect?

28:16.404 --> 28:19.532
Guy's taken the finest opiates
Blue Cross can buy,

28:19.657 --> 28:22.243
how come they didn't
trigger a placebo effect?

House, the kid's

- Where is it?
- Where's what?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.243
His idiot son
distracted the orderlies

29:04.368 --> 29:07.538

You can't help him.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.554
Zach, why did
you do this?

29:23.679 --> 29:27.057
Because he's

30:25.783 --> 30:28.452
It used to be something.
We can't find anything

Opioid-induced pain.

Pain and the drugs that treat pain work
by changing brain chemistry.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.969
Sometimes to the point
where pain receptors

30:45.094 --> 30:47.930
read painkillers as killer pain.

will recalibrate itself.

was pushed back?

31:29.138 --> 31:30.514

You do realize
that's a good thing?

31:35.185 --> 31:36.937
This place was a disaster.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.816
I had to stash a dirty

31:40.941 --> 31:42.484
So you buy another briefcase.

31:42.610 --> 31:45.529

That's like handing a 12-year-old

31:45.654 --> 31:47.448

cabinet and the car.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.033
You passed the inspection.

The car is still in the driveway.

to saw someone in half?

31:55.998 --> 31:58.626
Did I mention you
passed the inspection?

32:00.586 --> 32:04.006
I passed by their meager standard,

always do that?

- Create ridiculous standards

32:10.930 --> 32:14.058
that no human could meet.
With your careers, with your kids.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.434
You gotta be more
like us men.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.645
Be lazy? Blame others?

32:18.228 --> 32:20.940
Get help.
Most men in your position

32:21.065 --> 32:23.025
have a deputy and
two assistants at work,

and a wife and two nannies at home.

You're not Superwoman,
don't be a martyr.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.453
We'll be injecting
you with naloxone,

32:34.578 --> 32:36.997
which will knock the opioids
out of your pain receptors.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.541
If we're right, your system will
recalibrate within a few hours,

32:39.667 --> 32:41.335
- and most of the pain will be gone.
- Hours?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.461
I need those drugs.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.545
Not if they're
causing your pain.

Then knock me out,

everything out of your system.

the mother of all God complexes.

So busy treating everyone's problems,
he was blind to his own.

33:12.700 --> 33:17.037
Helped himself to a vial of insulin.
It's a miracle he survived.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.709

It's the only
hunch we've got.

I'd manipulate a clinical trial

he'd sleep with you.

I think you got her in
because of your usual messiah complex.

with the appointment schedule

Oh, so close.
The correct answer is epilepsy.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.924
Epilepsy doesn't
cause chronic pain.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.176
It does if it spreads
to the sensory region of the brain,

38:23.302 --> 38:24.886
then rewires the pain neurons.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.305
Would've shown up
on an EEG.

Not if the seizures are in a place
you can't see on an EEG,

38:29.057 --> 38:30.517
a place too deep
in the brain,

38:30.642 --> 38:34.146

It was lower, right?

38:55.208 --> 38:56.501
It's everywhere.

38:56.626 --> 38:57.919
But when it first started.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.380
It started in the
stomach, cramps.

39:00.505 --> 39:05.218
Like bad gas or
a permeating pain?

through your scrotum?

39:12.476 --> 39:13.852
Why?

39:13.977 --> 39:16.021
Because epilepsy
is treatable.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.094
Looks like we shot
the guys with the torches.

40:29.219 --> 40:32.139
Yeah. Pays to hang around.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.310
That selfish ass
with the God complex

40:37.519 --> 40:40.147
who almost made
the stupidest decision of his life,

40:40.730 --> 40:43.692
it wasn't your colleague,
was it? It was you.

40:45.819 --> 40:46.903
No.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.243
See you tomorrow.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.300
You're here early.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.178
I'm feeling better.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.851
- What's wrong?
- IV's leaking a little.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.060
It's no big deal.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.104
I'll be right back.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.355
Foreman.

41:24.858 --> 41:26.109
You busy tonight?

41:28.945 --> 41:30.030
No.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.583
Rita, the spike on Dr. Hadley's IV bag
wasn't pushed in all the way.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.918
I don't want
any dosing errors.

41:43.043 --> 41:45.128
Sorry. It won't happen again.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.131
- Stinks, doesn't it?
- What?

41:48.256 --> 41:51.718
The medication. When we switch out the
bags you can smell it. It's disgusting.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.136
I didn't smell anything.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.889
She must be on
the placebo, then.

42:15.951 --> 42:19.162
You offered to do House's budget because
you wanted him to owe you,

42:19.287 --> 42:22.082
wanted him to take
that case. Why?

42:22.207 --> 42:24.709
I thought it would help House,
seeing someone worse off than him,

42:24.834 --> 42:27.504
possibly curing a guy
with even less to look forward to.

42:31.633 --> 42:32.926
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:33.385 --> 42:34.970
Can I ask you something?

42:38.139 --> 42:40.058
How would you like my job?
