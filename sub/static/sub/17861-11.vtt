00:02.757 --> 00:04.437
Feel free to scurry to him again.

00:04.790 --> 00:06.548
I can fight my own battles.

00:06.550 --> 00:09.748
What you've achieved in one day
is nothing short of miraculous.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.228
It augurs well
for how you'll manage with George.

00:12.230 --> 00:15.228
We wouldn't want him
suspecting collusion.

00:15.230 --> 00:18.428
Just so you know,
I've never told anyone about us.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.990
Step away from the car.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.308
No, I love you.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.188
I love you, Sarah.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.868
But you will help me, won't you?

00:30.870 --> 00:34.588
If you are pregnant, perhaps.
It's very complicated.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.230
What am I going to do?

00:39.649 --> 00:44.943

01:30.709 --> 01:33.307
I'm getting bigger by the day.

01:33.309 --> 01:34.827
Hmm?

01:34.829 --> 01:36.909
I'm expanding.

01:38.429 --> 01:40.587
Perhaps it's twins.

01:40.589 --> 01:42.307
It might be triplets.

01:42.309 --> 01:44.427
Stop it!

01:44.429 --> 01:46.107
Yes?

01:46.109 --> 01:49.427
The hospital called. They're
discharging your grandmother.

01:49.429 --> 01:52.667
Regina and I will collect her.
Best you're here when she arrives.

01:52.669 --> 01:57.187
And remember, calm and relaxation
is her best medicine.

01:57.189 --> 01:58.789
Of course.

02:01.349 --> 02:02.867
You will try?

02:02.869 --> 02:05.107
It's been so wonderful without her.

02:05.109 --> 02:06.947
For me.

02:06.949 --> 02:10.227
You know it has.
Please.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.067
We've come so far.

02:12.069 --> 02:13.549
We won't lose what we've gained.

02:17.989 --> 02:20.067
Oh, before you go...

02:20.069 --> 02:22.869
Queen Elizabeth has summoned you.
She's in the garden.

02:27.309 --> 02:29.107
Ah, Sister.
Mrs Bligh.

02:29.109 --> 02:30.547
Take a seat.

02:30.549 --> 02:32.867
I doubt Dr Duncan would want me
here.

02:32.869 --> 02:35.909
Your refusal is much more likely
to agitate me.

02:40.269 --> 02:43.027
It's Jack that I wish to discuss.

02:43.029 --> 02:46.427
He told me what happened
after the reception for the Japanese.

02:46.429 --> 02:48.229
What did he say?

02:49.189 --> 02:51.387
That he drank, a lot,

02:51.389 --> 02:52.987
and that you looked after him.

02:52.989 --> 02:54.427
Is there more to tell?

02:54.429 --> 02:56.069
No.

02:58.629 --> 03:00.307
Well, he assures me
it was an aberration,

03:00.309 --> 03:02.707
not a return to old patterns.

03:02.709 --> 03:06.667
He hasn't been tempted again in the
last week, but he will bear watching.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.307
Of course.

03:08.309 --> 03:12.867
And given my current incapacity,
I would appreciate your assistance.

03:12.869 --> 03:15.387
You seem to have
some influence over him.

03:15.389 --> 03:17.789
He's lucky to have
such a good friend in you.

03:19.709 --> 03:23.627
I would prefer it if you would resist
any need to sentimentalise.

03:23.629 --> 03:25.229
Perish the thought.

03:27.029 --> 03:28.667
Doctor?
Yes?

03:28.669 --> 03:30.347
Your house call with Sister Adams?

03:30.349 --> 03:33.789
Right.
She's in the garden with Mrs Bligh.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.227
So I can count on you?
Yes.

03:38.229 --> 03:39.547
Good.

03:39.549 --> 03:41.309
That will be all.

03:43.709 --> 03:46.467
Mrs Bligh...
Nothing further needs to be said.

03:46.469 --> 03:48.427
Oh, other than to thank you

03:48.429 --> 03:53.387
for so assiduously avoiding me
during my stay.

03:53.389 --> 03:55.229
It did help.

04:01.749 --> 04:04.867
Before you say anything,
she asked to see me.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.827
Why?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.547
Personal matter.

04:07.549 --> 04:10.547
She thanked me for keeping
out of her way while she was here.

04:10.549 --> 04:12.667
So no olive branch, then?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.909
A very withered one, if there was.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.786
Yeah, right, well, uh... You ready?

04:18.789 --> 04:20.349
Yeah.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.867
You've been home for days.

04:36.869 --> 04:38.427
Gino.

04:38.429 --> 04:42.187
I've waited, I've thrown stones
at your window.

04:42.189 --> 04:43.867
Mamma says
you won't even look at her.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.349
Please.

04:50.349 --> 04:53.589
You want Andrew Swanson.

04:55.189 --> 04:59.067
I heard him at the reception,
talking about seeing you.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.709
It's not how it seems.

05:02.229 --> 05:04.147
I told you to trust me.

05:04.149 --> 05:06.349
How can I?

05:12.349 --> 05:15.309
I didn't want to tell you
unless I had to.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.627
And I tried...
I tried to make it go away.

05:19.629 --> 05:22.269
I did everything
that I could to lose it.

05:23.709 --> 05:25.629
Anna?

05:27.149 --> 05:29.109
I'm pregnant.

05:34.509 --> 05:37.109
A lot better.
You can get dressed.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.629
Here.

05:42.629 --> 05:44.867
When you say better...?

05:44.869 --> 05:47.507
With the lung healing well,
and now she's not contagious,

05:47.509 --> 05:49.587
she can start going outside.

05:49.589 --> 05:52.787
Wunderbar! Oh, Leah, you hear?

05:52.789 --> 05:54.227
To the movies?

05:54.229 --> 05:57.867
Sarah, we can go.
Dr Duncan, you come too.

05:57.869 --> 05:59.707
You don't need me tagging along.

05:59.709 --> 06:02.067
And that's a ways off.
Just a small walk each day.

06:02.069 --> 06:04.707
But when we do go, you must come.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.427
First you must learn
to dress yourself.

06:06.429 --> 06:07.627
Oh. Here.

06:07.629 --> 06:10.347
I've gotta go and discharge
Elizabeth. You right here?

06:10.349 --> 06:11.867
Of course.
I'll let myself out.

06:11.869 --> 06:14.147
This Friday,
you must join us for Shabbos.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.267
Sarah, yes?
Yes.

06:16.269 --> 06:18.707
Doctor? Both of you.
Please.

06:18.709 --> 06:22.947
Friday. Uh, no. Friday's bad.

06:22.949 --> 06:27.709
Um, finishing off the week.
But thank you.

06:30.029 --> 06:31.587
I'm sorry.

06:31.589 --> 06:33.789
For what?
Not trusting you.

06:34.789 --> 06:36.547
We must not hurt our baby.

06:36.549 --> 06:38.307
It'd solve everything.
No.

06:38.309 --> 06:41.027
It would.
It's taking a life. It's a sin.

06:41.029 --> 06:43.109
I couldn't be with you
if you did that. Ever.

06:45.829 --> 06:47.867
Promise me.

06:47.869 --> 06:50.867
I promise.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.547
We tell them. We marry.

06:52.549 --> 06:54.907
Saying we want to marry
is hard enough.

06:54.909 --> 06:56.627
Saying that we have to marry...

06:56.629 --> 06:59.989
What else can we do?
It would kill my grandmother.

07:02.229 --> 07:03.827
Then what?

07:03.829 --> 07:06.589
There's one thing we could do.

07:08.069 --> 07:10.269
If Aunt Carolyn agrees.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.347
And those are to be taken...

07:14.349 --> 07:16.587
With food.
Not chocolate.

07:16.589 --> 07:19.987
Deprived of even
the smallest pleasure.

07:19.989 --> 07:21.907
Complete rest.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.387
We'll make sure of that.
Won't we, George?

07:24.389 --> 07:25.747
The sitting room's set up.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.707
She only has to manage
the stairs morning and night.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.907
I am not a total invalid.
But you're not well.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.387
She'll want for nothing.

07:32.389 --> 07:34.669
Oh, I would prefer the dignity
of walking out of here.

07:43.669 --> 07:46.347
I can see you're going to be
a handful.

07:46.349 --> 07:48.029
George?

07:51.869 --> 07:54.387
Oh, Nurse Grey,
thank you for my care.

07:54.389 --> 07:55.907
My pleasure, Mrs Bligh.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.989
I'll commend you to the board.

08:00.829 --> 08:02.267
Sister.

08:02.269 --> 08:03.869
Mr Bligh.

08:04.909 --> 08:05.989
Homeward.

08:19.269 --> 08:20.987
Doctor?

08:20.989 --> 08:22.509
Yes?

08:24.669 --> 08:26.547
Miriam's invitation.

08:26.549 --> 08:30.787
It isn't every day a goy
gets invited to a family Shabbat.

08:30.789 --> 08:33.029
Yeah, it's a shame I can't go.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.629
You're very rarely here late
on a Friday.

08:40.109 --> 08:42.187
If it's to do with me...

08:42.188 --> 08:44.309
Why would it be?

08:46.989 --> 08:49.109
You've changed since yesterday.

08:50.669 --> 08:52.947
It all came back last night.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.429
There's no need to be embarrassed.

08:56.309 --> 09:01.307
I was thrown at first.
And then flattered.

09:01.309 --> 09:03.307
Under different circumstances...

09:03.309 --> 09:04.907
Don't...

09:04.909 --> 09:08.109
Let's just leave it there, eh?

09:12.269 --> 09:13.869
Can I ask you one thing?

09:16.149 --> 09:19.189
You're back on the wagon...
This won't change that.

09:25.789 --> 09:28.709
Please know you can always ask
for help if you need it.

09:37.789 --> 09:39.629
It's good to have you back.
Mmm.

09:40.629 --> 09:44.389
Olivia, you've been well?
Yes. Welcome home.

09:50.349 --> 09:52.067
Oh, it is good to be home.

09:52.069 --> 09:56.267
And you, miss.
Gallivanting about in the city...

09:56.269 --> 09:58.107
I wouldn't have gone
if you'd minded.

09:58.109 --> 10:00.947
You had better things to do
than hover around my sick bed.

10:00.949 --> 10:02.387
Andrew?

10:02.389 --> 10:04.347
We've had fun.

10:04.349 --> 10:07.227
I hope your aunt is behaving herself
around him.

10:07.229 --> 10:08.747
She makes him laugh.

10:08.749 --> 10:10.787
I'm sure.

10:10.789 --> 10:15.147
I was thinking of going back there
tomorrow. If I'm not needed.

10:15.149 --> 10:17.067
You go and enjoy yourself.

10:17.069 --> 10:20.469
And now rest, I think.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.667
Anything you need, you let me know.

10:25.669 --> 10:28.187
Oh, I will. I'm being spoilt.
Reggie, would you stay, dear?

10:28.189 --> 10:32.867
Of course.
Don't fuss, dear. Just sit. Sit.

10:32.869 --> 10:34.469
Of course.

10:36.109 --> 10:38.867
Your staying -
it's really not necessary.

10:38.869 --> 10:41.467
But you're still convalescing.

10:41.469 --> 10:44.307
You have yourself to think of,

10:44.309 --> 10:47.027
a life to make,
without your late husband.

10:47.029 --> 10:49.309
I'm very happy here.

10:52.549 --> 10:54.347
I thought you'd be grateful.

10:54.349 --> 10:59.709
I am. I asked you to maintain
the status quo and you have.

11:01.349 --> 11:03.627
I'd make him a good wife.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.269
Perhaps.

11:06.309 --> 11:07.789
Perhaps not.

11:08.909 --> 11:13.909
Neither of us is under any illusion
about the other, I think.

11:16.669 --> 11:19.269
Elizabeth, I'm asking for a chance.

11:20.309 --> 11:24.549
I am very grateful for what
you've done, but I think not.

11:26.509 --> 11:27.947
I see.

11:27.949 --> 11:32.189
The right man is out there for you.
Somewhere.

11:59.109 --> 12:02.307
I'm looking for Mr Bligh. Senior.

12:02.309 --> 12:04.989
He went riding, ma'am.
Over towards the west paddock.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.611
Saddle me a horse. Now.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.976
Yes, dear?

13:17.978 --> 13:20.258
You've been premature.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.853
In dismissing me.

13:24.038 --> 13:27.356
There's a limit to what you can
control when you're lying there.

13:27.358 --> 13:31.436
Is there something specific
that you want to say to me?

13:31.438 --> 13:34.436
As you said,
you don't need my help.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.156
I said I don't need
a daughter-in-law.

13:37.158 --> 13:40.198
You may be far closer to getting
one of those than you imagine.

13:42.638 --> 13:44.398
I'd best start packing.

13:45.998 --> 13:48.198
Regina. You know something.
What is it?

13:49.358 --> 13:52.758
It's a quid pro quo world, dear.

13:53.758 --> 13:55.356
I'll help

13:55.358 --> 13:57.436
if you don't stand between me

13:57.438 --> 13:59.836
and whatever affection
I can foster in George.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.356
Tell me.

14:01.358 --> 14:02.878
Say it.

14:04.998 --> 14:07.158
You may stay.

14:08.118 --> 14:12.198
Whether your charms have any effect
is up to George.

14:13.438 --> 14:17.758
I saw them at the guest cottage.
Him and the Jew.

14:20.518 --> 14:23.398
They're rutting at Ash Park.

14:24.758 --> 14:27.438
How long before she's living here?

14:38.158 --> 14:39.916
Uh, case files.
Thanks.

14:39.918 --> 14:41.558
I'll see you tomorrow.
You got a minute?

14:43.358 --> 14:45.996
Uh, it's about the other day.

14:45.998 --> 14:48.038
It's not really necessary...
Please.

14:50.158 --> 14:52.158
I, uh... I remembered all of it.

14:54.358 --> 14:56.078
What you said too.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.866
Ravensbruck.

15:00.106 --> 15:02.006
I know you're loath
to open up about your past,

15:02.087 --> 15:03.605
but you did, to help me.

15:03.607 --> 15:05.167
Thank you.

15:06.407 --> 15:08.727
It's not something
you share easily.

15:10.167 --> 15:13.325
When people say how sorry
they are for you,

15:13.327 --> 15:17.327
they can't imagine what it was like
in one of those places.

15:17.442 --> 15:20.562
They're right. They can't.
No.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.282
I was lucky not to die.

15:26.642 --> 15:29.202
Most of the time I wished I would.

15:32.802 --> 15:35.640
Maybe that's why
I fell in love with you.

15:35.642 --> 15:38.802
Someone who would understand?

15:41.402 --> 15:44.202
You deserve better than being
my emotional crutch.

15:45.682 --> 15:47.682
You're my friend.

15:49.402 --> 15:51.762
And I'm yours.

15:53.602 --> 15:58.080
You were seen, so do not add
to the indignity by trying to deny
it.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.720
This is not good for your health.

15:59.722 --> 16:01.320
Well, you should have
thought of that

16:01.322 --> 16:02.920
before you embarked
on this sordid affair.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.440
You have to stay calm.

16:04.442 --> 16:07.402
That rather depends
on your response, doesn't it?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.200
Well?

16:10.202 --> 16:12.160
Who saw us?

16:12.162 --> 16:14.800
What does it matter?
Well, they put your health at risk.

16:14.802 --> 16:16.360
They betrayed me.

16:16.362 --> 16:19.440
What matters is that you end it.

16:19.442 --> 16:23.640
What if... one of the staff
had seen you, or one of the workers?

16:23.642 --> 16:27.440
So it was one of the family?
What were you thinking?

16:27.442 --> 16:31.840
Honestly, George. Her? And here?

16:31.842 --> 16:33.440
If you wanted
to wallow in the mire...

16:33.442 --> 16:35.042
That's enough!

16:41.522 --> 16:43.000
I care for Sarah.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.840
I'm sure you do.
But there is no future in it.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.962
The sooner it ends, the better.

16:50.202 --> 16:52.520
If you want to send me to my grave,
then continue.

16:52.522 --> 16:54.482
Mother...
No. I've had my say.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.162
The rest's up to you.

16:59.922 --> 17:02.162
Go and make your choice.

17:04.162 --> 17:06.842
Your family or your lust.

17:07.842 --> 17:09.760
My love.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.281
Hm.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.041
James?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.800
Have you been out on the property?

17:24.801 --> 17:26.880
We moved in one of the flocks.

17:26.882 --> 17:29.120
From?
The gully.

17:29.122 --> 17:30.880
So you didn't pass by
the old cottage?

17:30.882 --> 17:33.162
No. Why?

17:34.562 --> 17:37.400
Someone has upset
your grandmother.

17:37.402 --> 17:39.480
I haven't spoken to her
since this morning.

17:39.482 --> 17:41.402
Could you ask Olivia?

17:42.482 --> 17:44.120
If she did say
something inappropriate,

17:44.122 --> 17:45.640
I'm sure it was unintended.

17:45.642 --> 17:47.120
Of course.

17:47.122 --> 17:51.242
But if it was her, I'd appreciate
it not being discussed any further.

17:52.602 --> 17:54.282
Thank you.

18:03.162 --> 18:04.760
- The cottage?
- Mmm.

18:04.762 --> 18:10.160
No. I didn't leave the house,
in case Elizabeth needed me. Why?

18:10.162 --> 18:12.882
It's not important.

18:14.562 --> 18:17.280
I'm not just here
to help your mother.

18:17.282 --> 18:21.200
You've been so generous.
I... I can't thank you enough.

18:21.202 --> 18:24.722
As long as you need me, I'm here.

18:32.882 --> 18:34.720
What's the cottage
have to do with it?

18:34.722 --> 18:36.280
I don't know.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.040
I haven't said anything to her.

18:39.042 --> 18:41.680
Not even inadvertently?

18:41.682 --> 18:45.240
I am doing everything I can
to avoid her.

18:45.242 --> 18:48.840
I am not about to go scurrying
with tittle-tattle!

18:48.842 --> 18:50.800
I didn't mean...
I am trying my best, James.

18:50.802 --> 18:53.522
Father is very upset.

18:54.562 --> 18:59.122
Not even a day back
and she has us fighting again.

19:06.322 --> 19:08.840
Things will settle.

19:08.842 --> 19:11.520
I need to get away.

19:11.522 --> 19:13.520
We can't.

19:13.522 --> 19:18.042
I won't have our baby born
into her pit of poison.

19:19.602 --> 19:22.002
Don't make me go without you.

19:34.042 --> 19:37.480
I expect at least one telephone call
with all your news.

19:37.482 --> 19:38.960
Of course.

19:38.962 --> 19:41.042
And give my best to Andrew.

19:42.042 --> 19:44.202
Now a word with your father,
privately, please.

19:45.802 --> 19:47.322
I'll see you outside.

19:51.002 --> 19:53.520
Have you reached
any conclusions?

19:53.522 --> 19:56.002
I think my attitude
is perfectly clear.

19:57.082 --> 19:58.960
Some time away
will make you see sense.

19:58.962 --> 20:00.920
Does that woman know
what's happened?

20:00.922 --> 20:04.122
Sarah doesn't need to know
until we resolve something.

20:05.882 --> 20:09.120
You know my feelings for Sarah are
no reflection on my love for you.

20:09.122 --> 20:11.562
Oh, spare me the platitudes.
It's true.

20:12.642 --> 20:17.880
If you choose her,
there will be consequences.

20:17.882 --> 20:20.202
Understand that.

20:47.427 --> 20:49.825
Where were you?
Just thinking.

20:49.827 --> 20:51.987
Everything's changing.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.345
What makes you say that?

20:54.347 --> 20:57.985
We're all so different from the
people who came back from England.

20:57.987 --> 20:59.505
Don't you think?

20:59.507 --> 21:01.467
You're very serious
all of a sudden.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.667
Father...
What?

21:07.027 --> 21:09.625
Anna, was it you who said something
to your grandmother?

21:09.627 --> 21:11.825
No, I told you it wasn't.

21:11.827 --> 21:15.067
Then why so grim? Hmm?

21:16.027 --> 21:17.505
Nothing.

21:17.507 --> 21:19.305
You sure?
Mmm.

21:19.307 --> 21:21.305
I was just being silly for a moment.

21:21.307 --> 21:22.827
It doesn't matter.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.987
To the city, Jeeves!

21:38.507 --> 21:40.025
What are you doing here?

21:40.027 --> 21:42.825
Your dad's given me a few days work.
I thought he would've told you.

21:42.827 --> 21:45.587
No.
That's alright, isn't it?

21:47.547 --> 21:49.345
Of course.
You haven't been over.

21:49.347 --> 21:51.665
I've been busy.

21:51.667 --> 21:55.025
That all it is?
Yes.

21:55.027 --> 21:58.185
I was worried you might be angry
I worked at your party.

21:58.187 --> 22:00.345
Why would I be angry?

22:00.347 --> 22:02.745
No reason.

22:02.747 --> 22:05.107
Your wife's pretty.

22:06.227 --> 22:07.905
She's beautiful.

22:07.907 --> 22:09.427
She's a lucky woman.

22:10.387 --> 22:12.827
You're a lucky man.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.065
You were gone early.

22:25.067 --> 22:27.065
I had work to do.

22:27.067 --> 22:31.025
I didn't mean to issue you
with an ultimatum last night.

22:31.027 --> 22:32.905
I understand what you're saying.

22:32.907 --> 22:35.665
I wouldn't leave without you.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.905
I love you.

22:37.907 --> 22:42.825
But please. Please consider it.

22:42.827 --> 22:46.947
This is my home. My family.

22:48.427 --> 22:50.587
We are your family too.

22:51.547 --> 22:54.547
It doesn't have to be forever.

23:20.987 --> 23:22.905
I'll carry it up.

23:22.907 --> 23:24.905
I can manage!

23:24.907 --> 23:27.265
Are you trying to get rid of me?
You're late.

23:27.267 --> 23:28.825
It's fine.

23:28.827 --> 23:31.427
Tell Carolyn I'm sorry I had to dash.

23:32.947 --> 23:34.547
I'll see her next time.

23:40.227 --> 23:43.185
Have you told George yet?

23:43.187 --> 23:46.345
I tried to tell Father earlier.

23:46.347 --> 23:50.065
And I couldn't. I was too ashamed.

23:50.067 --> 23:52.707
So what are you going to do?

23:53.947 --> 23:55.545
Well, that's why I'm here.

23:55.547 --> 23:58.625
I won't arrange an abortion for you,
you know that.

23:58.627 --> 24:00.667
Gino won't let me anyway.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.947
He's a good Catholic boy.
Of course not.

24:06.707 --> 24:10.385
So now you're the only one
who can help me.

24:10.387 --> 24:14.665
And please don't say anything
until I've explained it all.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.107
Alright.

24:18.267 --> 24:22.305
We could go away together,
just you and I,

24:22.307 --> 24:25.225
just before I start showing.

24:25.227 --> 24:26.825
Europe, maybe.

24:26.827 --> 24:30.265
You could say you're studying
or painting or something

24:30.267 --> 24:32.747
and that you need the company.

24:33.707 --> 24:37.545
We'd stay away long enough
until I've... had the baby

24:37.547 --> 24:40.265
and found someone
to take care of it.

24:40.267 --> 24:42.305
And no-one would ever have to know.

24:42.307 --> 24:44.345
And then... and then I'd come back

24:44.347 --> 24:47.065
and Gino and I would
convince them to let us marry

24:47.067 --> 24:49.265
when the timing's right.

24:49.267 --> 24:53.025
And... and maybe
we could even go back afterwards

24:53.027 --> 24:56.745
and... and get the baby.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.265
What?

24:59.267 --> 25:01.145
Nothing.

25:01.147 --> 25:03.507
What?
Excuse me.

25:13.507 --> 25:15.145
Did you get your envelope?
No.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.745
There's an envelope
with your name on it.

25:16.747 --> 25:18.665
I wasn't here. I don't know who left
it.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.145
Thanks.

25:20.147 --> 25:21.627
Gesundheit.

25:32.387 --> 25:34.547
Sit, please.

25:37.227 --> 25:39.467
I wasn't sure you'd come.

25:40.467 --> 25:42.465
Is this about Dr Duncan?

25:42.467 --> 25:44.385
No.

25:44.387 --> 25:47.225
Although, looking back
to our little chat yesterday,

25:47.227 --> 25:49.385
I do find it
rather extraordinary.

25:49.387 --> 25:50.905
In what way?

25:50.907 --> 25:53.587
That you could look me in the eye
while we were having it.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.867
I know. About the affair.

26:01.587 --> 26:04.905
In your state of health this isn't
a conversation we should have.

26:04.907 --> 26:06.707
Which is why we'll keep it brief.

26:09.427 --> 26:11.945
George says he loves you.

26:11.947 --> 26:13.907
Do you love him?

26:15.027 --> 26:16.745
Yes.

26:16.747 --> 26:20.387
Then you will leave him
before you ruin him.

26:21.387 --> 26:23.305
You know you will.

26:23.307 --> 26:27.505
Why else have you worked so hard
to keep it a secret?

26:27.507 --> 26:29.985
We did that for you.
Oh.

26:29.987 --> 26:33.265
And when I die
you'll announce it to everyone

26:33.267 --> 26:35.105
and live happily ever after.

26:35.107 --> 26:39.185
You are completely unsuited.
You must know that.

26:39.187 --> 26:40.865
I didn't want this to happen.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.465
Oh, then you should
have controlled yourself.

26:42.467 --> 26:45.427
I mean this - you, upsetting you.

26:46.627 --> 26:49.625
You have to know
there is no future in it.

26:49.627 --> 26:52.385
I know that I love him.
Selfishly.

26:52.387 --> 26:54.865
Or you would finish it now.

26:54.867 --> 26:57.625
If we do, we'll do it together.

26:57.627 --> 27:00.547
I will not stand idly by
and let it happen.

27:01.827 --> 27:03.547
Please excuse me.

27:05.187 --> 27:07.307
Do what you know is right.

27:20.147 --> 27:21.625
Keep your eye on her.

27:21.627 --> 27:24.065
Call Dr Duncan immediately
if there's any sign of pain.

27:24.067 --> 27:28.225
You care? I'd wish her dead
in your shoes.

27:28.227 --> 27:29.665
Of course you would.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.065
You know,

27:31.067 --> 27:33.947
don't delude yourself.

27:35.907 --> 27:37.785
George might take a Yid
as his whore,

27:37.787 --> 27:40.027
but he's never going to marry one.

28:06.814 --> 28:08.374
Hello?

28:09.599 --> 28:11.199
Who's there?

28:19.719 --> 28:21.877
Harry? What are you doing here?

28:21.879 --> 28:24.119
Wh... what are you doing?

28:25.879 --> 28:27.559
Harry.

28:28.919 --> 28:30.399
Stop. Stop.

28:36.759 --> 28:38.279
Livvy?

29:11.279 --> 29:13.917
James?
We should go.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.999
Pardon?
To the city.

29:17.359 --> 29:21.119
You were right.
We'll leave as soon as possible.

29:23.359 --> 29:25.359
Thank you.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.839
What was it that I said?

29:51.399 --> 29:55.157
How many times
do I have to tell you? Nothing.

29:55.159 --> 29:58.839
I saw you. What was it?

29:59.639 --> 30:01.839
I can't.
Please.

30:10.879 --> 30:12.479
Alright.

30:17.679 --> 30:21.719
You sat there and told me my story.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.279
That's exactly what happened
to me at your age.

30:30.519 --> 30:34.517
I fell pregnant, Mother sent me away
to avoid a scandal,

30:34.519 --> 30:36.639
and I gave birth overseas.

30:39.159 --> 30:42.677
You asked me to do for you
what had been done for me.

30:42.679 --> 30:45.197
I had no idea.

30:45.199 --> 30:47.757
Yeah, well, that one's been
locked away in the family vault

30:47.759 --> 30:49.477
for a very long time.

30:49.479 --> 30:51.877
Whatever else made me
the black sheep of the family,

30:51.879 --> 30:53.397
that was the start of it.

30:53.399 --> 30:54.919
But who knows?

30:55.999 --> 31:01.197
Your grandmother, uh, George
and Elaine did. That's all.

31:01.199 --> 31:02.839
Who's the father?

31:04.679 --> 31:06.997
I'm the only one who knows that.

31:06.999 --> 31:11.077
And it will go with me to the grave.
Even he doesn't know.

31:11.079 --> 31:13.679
About the baby?
Yes.

31:15.759 --> 31:17.639
What happened to it?

31:24.359 --> 31:28.637
She... she went to
a good home. I'd rather not...

31:28.639 --> 31:30.279
Of course.

31:32.639 --> 31:35.399
No wonder you went pale.

31:39.879 --> 31:45.479
So will you do it? The same? For me?

31:47.919 --> 31:51.559
It's more complicated
than you can begin to imagine.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.119
We'll see.

32:04.319 --> 32:06.277
Breakfast?

32:06.279 --> 32:08.557
That's Carla's job.

32:08.559 --> 32:11.437
Which, I hope, makes my doing it
mean all the more.

32:11.439 --> 32:13.317
Here, please.

32:13.319 --> 32:16.677
I'm sorry about our misunderstanding
the other day.

32:16.679 --> 32:19.879
I don't think either of us
misunderstood a thing.

32:23.119 --> 32:28.357
I am going to try to make George
see me as more than a sister-in-law.

32:28.359 --> 32:30.597
I can't stop you.

32:30.599 --> 32:32.597
And if I succeed...

32:32.599 --> 32:34.557
I think that's a conversation
for another day.

32:34.559 --> 32:39.719
I'd like you to place
a telephone call for me.

32:40.879 --> 32:42.479
To my solicitor.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.237
Alma's concerned her cold
might be contagious.

32:47.239 --> 32:49.837
So if you wouldn't mind
filling in on the wards today...

32:49.839 --> 32:52.477
Oh. Yes.

32:52.479 --> 32:53.759
You right?

32:55.679 --> 32:59.157
It might be an idea
if you look in on Elizabeth later.

32:59.159 --> 33:01.279
Why?

33:05.679 --> 33:09.277
George and I have been... meeting.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.399
Meeting?

33:14.639 --> 33:17.117
Oh... yeah, right.
I'm sorry...

33:17.119 --> 33:19.799
No, hey, we've sorted all that out.
Mmm.

33:25.519 --> 33:27.517
He's a... he's a good man.

33:27.519 --> 33:29.717
He is.

33:29.719 --> 33:33.357
It won't be easy.
It won't.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.917
And Elizabeth knows?

33:34.919 --> 33:36.519
She does.

33:38.239 --> 33:41.237
You've just given her
a whole new lease on life.

33:41.239 --> 33:43.279
She's gonna survive
just to spite you.

33:51.359 --> 33:54.157
Are you sure this is what you want?

33:54.159 --> 33:55.797
Would I have said so otherwise?

33:55.799 --> 33:58.277
As your solicitor, Elizabeth,

33:58.279 --> 34:01.277
I have to say
that in your current condition...

34:01.279 --> 34:04.037
I know exactly what I'm doing.

34:04.039 --> 34:06.557
Now, go away, draw up
the appropriate papers,

34:06.559 --> 34:08.197
and bring them back for me to sign.

34:08.199 --> 34:12.879
Mr Bligh...
Mr Bligh does not retain you. I do.

34:17.559 --> 34:20.917
This is a huge change.
Exactly.

34:20.918 --> 34:23.516
Thank you again for coming
at such short notice.

34:23.518 --> 34:25.516
I believe you know the way out.

34:25.518 --> 34:27.556
Good morning.

34:27.559 --> 34:29.559
Good morning.

34:44.799 --> 34:47.119
Come with me.
Where are we going?

34:48.199 --> 34:49.998
Please just come.

35:04.079 --> 35:05.757
This is where I came to decide

35:05.759 --> 35:07.999
whether or not
I would give my child away.

35:09.879 --> 35:12.917
You're about to make one
of the biggest decisions of your life

35:12.919 --> 35:14.397
and there are some things I know

35:14.399 --> 35:16.317
that might change
the way you think about it.

35:16.319 --> 35:18.879
Yes?

35:20.519 --> 35:22.839
Oh, I've thought
so many times about this moment.

35:25.519 --> 35:29.079
If I don't do it here, now,
I suspect I never will.

35:30.719 --> 35:32.999
I don't understand.

35:39.239 --> 35:41.677
The child I had, my darling,

35:41.679 --> 35:45.479
the child that I gave away
to be raised by others...

35:47.399 --> 35:49.079
..it was you.

35:54.175 --> 35:56.575
It was your grandmother's idea.

35:58.415 --> 36:00.535
Your father was happy to embrace it.

36:03.535 --> 36:06.173
Elaine and I went overseas

36:06.175 --> 36:09.815
and came back with a daughter,
ostensibly theirs.

36:12.415 --> 36:14.613
I've never suspected.

36:14.615 --> 36:17.253
Not for a moment.

36:17.255 --> 36:20.775
They loved you as if you were
their own. Why would you?

36:22.695 --> 36:27.335
Please don't...
Please don't hate me.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.053
Why would I hate you?

36:31.055 --> 36:34.693
For not being strong enough.
For giving you away.

36:34.695 --> 36:37.253
Don't.
I took the easy way out.

36:37.255 --> 36:39.095
Anna, listen to me.

36:41.815 --> 36:45.053
If you still want to go ahead
with the subterfuge,

36:45.055 --> 36:47.535
I will support you completely.

36:49.175 --> 36:54.415
But if you really love Gino,
and you both want the baby...

36:55.615 --> 36:59.135
..don't make the same mistake
that I did.

37:00.895 --> 37:03.255
I've regretted it every day since.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.095
Fine.

37:20.735 --> 37:23.253
I'm not even gonna bother
with the usual spiel about stress.

37:23.255 --> 37:25.173
It would seem rather pointless.

37:25.175 --> 37:28.613
I assume you're on her side,
as usual.

37:28.615 --> 37:30.453
I'll defend her to the hilt
as a nurse.

37:30.455 --> 37:32.215
But you have an opinion.

37:33.415 --> 37:36.733
She's one of the finest women
I've ever met, Elizabeth,

37:36.735 --> 37:41.015
and if she'd have me,
I'd marry her tomorrow.

37:42.335 --> 37:44.215
But she loves George.

37:46.335 --> 37:48.893
If you gave her a chance,
I reckon she'd surprise you.

37:48.895 --> 37:50.615
Oh, I doubt it.

37:51.615 --> 37:56.655
Times are changing.
Could be time you changed too.

37:57.695 --> 38:00.333
Family duty is a constant.

38:00.335 --> 38:04.173
George isn't the only Bligh
who's been asked to put it first.

38:04.175 --> 38:05.333
You?

38:05.335 --> 38:08.455
I ask nothing of him
I haven't asked of myself.

38:09.415 --> 38:11.255
What if he can't give it?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.215
I've always loved you.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.775
Thank you.

38:24.255 --> 38:26.015
Now I love you even more.

38:31.255 --> 38:33.735
I'll marry Gino.

38:35.895 --> 38:39.173
Then I will have the baby.

38:39.175 --> 38:40.533
Good girl.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.735
You're my mother!

39:02.975 --> 39:04.453
Are you hungry?

39:04.455 --> 39:05.975
Starving.

39:15.615 --> 39:17.815
I think something's happening.

39:18.895 --> 39:21.093
There's been a lot
of coming and going.

39:21.095 --> 39:25.053
Sarah Adams, Dr Duncan,
and a funny little man

39:25.055 --> 39:27.053
who looked like a character
from Dickens.

39:27.055 --> 39:28.773
Grandmother?

39:28.775 --> 39:31.253
She seems fine.

39:31.255 --> 39:34.613
I hope it's not her health.

39:34.615 --> 39:37.893
The worse she is, the harder
it's gonna be to break the news.

39:37.895 --> 39:39.733
You're not having second thoughts?

39:39.735 --> 39:41.173
No.

39:41.175 --> 39:44.015
A whole new start.

39:46.535 --> 39:48.333
We'll leave it all behind us.

39:48.335 --> 39:50.575
I love you.

40:01.615 --> 40:05.173
Oh, you're back early.
How were the sales?

40:05.175 --> 40:07.973
We did very well.

40:07.975 --> 40:09.453
How's your health?

40:09.455 --> 40:11.455
Surviving.

40:12.415 --> 40:15.413
Don't stand there like
a naughty schoolboy, George. Come in.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.735
Let's discuss things as adults.

40:21.975 --> 40:24.173
I do worry about your heart.

40:24.175 --> 40:25.893
If it kills me, it kills me.

40:25.895 --> 40:28.173
And since that's
your opening gambit,

40:28.175 --> 40:30.735
I can only assume
I won't like what I hear.

40:35.535 --> 40:37.613
I'm hoping you'll understand.

40:37.615 --> 40:40.893
And as that's
your second gambit, I doubt I will.

40:40.895 --> 40:44.493
You intend to choose her
over the family?

40:44.495 --> 40:47.693
Why does choosing Sarah exclude you?

40:47.695 --> 40:51.335
Very well.
Let me tell you of my decision.

40:53.815 --> 40:59.893
If you even think of marrying this
woman, Ash Park will go to James.

40:59.895 --> 41:02.093
I beg your pardon?

41:02.095 --> 41:03.693
I've changed my will.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.973
If you persist with this folly,

41:05.975 --> 41:09.253
everything passes
on my death to James.

41:09.255 --> 41:10.773
You can't be serious.

41:10.775 --> 41:14.053
You can have Ash Park
or you can have her.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.895
You cannot have both.

41:19.615 --> 41:22.455
What sort of man
do you think I am?

41:24.895 --> 41:30.295
The sort of man who puts his mother
in an impossible position.

41:37.695 --> 41:41.255
George. George!

41:44.255 --> 41:45.975
George? George!

42:02.695 --> 42:04.333
Mr Bligh.

42:04.335 --> 42:06.533
I need to talk to you.

42:06.535 --> 42:08.735
You'll be fine there, Mrs Howard.

42:17.775 --> 42:19.375
Are you alright?

42:21.255 --> 42:25.455
I love you with all my heart.
Marry me.

42:26.455 --> 42:27.853
What?

42:27.855 --> 42:29.735
Marry me.

43:09.443 --> 43:31.435
