Christ, it stinks in here, Dad.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.801
Didn't I call someone last week
to clean this place up?

01:45.305 --> 01:47.441
Are you sleeping down here?

01:47.474 --> 01:50.944
The stairs are giving me
a pain in the ass.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.646
Yeah. Well, I told you
you could call me.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.650
We could bring the bed
in here if you want.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.486
-Did you get fired?
-No, I didn't get fired.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.222
-Where's Cathy?
-She's not coming today.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.956
Did she leave you?

02:03.990 --> 02:05.593
Cathy's fine.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.262
Your mother said
she was fine, too.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.764
Didn't stop her
from walking off on us.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.099
You can make yourself
somethin' decent to eat.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.901
Something healthy.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.103
Meatloaf.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.472
And a little bit of gin.

02:18.506 --> 02:22.342
Gin too much to ask
for a man dying alone here?

02:39.158 --> 02:40.461
Hey, Dad.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.396
I need
to ask you something.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.634
Leave me alone.

I can't really talk very loudly

03:08.421 --> 03:10.858

03:10.890 --> 03:14.562
I heard at the office
that Cathy kicked you out
and you're living in a motel.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.530
Who said that?

03:16.563 --> 03:18.431
That's not true.
Who said that?

03:18.466 --> 03:19.432
Wilson.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.868
He's out of his mind.
That is not true.

Hey.

-Guess what?
-What?

Tell me. And?

03:53.033 --> 03:54.567
There's sand.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.704
A beach.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.609
And we've made love
all day long.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.243
Mm.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.247
Say that thing that we do.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.817
This is what we do.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.288
Yeah. Say it again.

Hi.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.930
I'm supposed to ask you
for a cigarette.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.538
What was it,
some kind of dare?

06:46.673 --> 06:47.908
What grade are you in?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.644
-Seven.
-They don't teach you anything?

06:52.812 --> 06:53.913
This your idea?

06:55.382 --> 06:57.651
-Whose was it?
-Syd's.

She in seventh grade, too?

We all are.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.060
She looks older.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.596
I know.

07:10.362 --> 07:12.865
She always put you up
to things like this?

07:13.432 --> 07:14.935
I guess.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.651
All right.
Put it in your mouth.

her own cigarette.

Makeup.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.572
I don't have any money.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.944
I just buried my father.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.846
You ever been to a wake?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.192
You know,
your friends are over there,
laughing at you.

08:13.225 --> 08:14.961
You know that,
don't you?

08:18.298 --> 08:19.832
I'm gonna give you
a little tip.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.134
Something that
you can hold on to forever.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.137
-What?
-I'll even give you
this whole pack of cigarettes.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.608
In exchange, you let me
play a little trick
on your friend, Syd.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.177
Teach her a lesson
for doing this to you.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.812

I'm kidnapping you, okay?

I'm gonna march you over
to my truck.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.520
And you're not gonna scream.
You're just gonna look back
at them

08:41.554 --> 08:43.222
so they know
you're afraid.

-I'm just gonna play a trick
on your friends, okay?

to kill you right now.

should know better.

09:31.403 --> 09:35.341
It was a very dumb thing for you
to do to be coming up to me
like that.

Which way?
Where do you live?

but I could've been.

and tell your parents
what happened.

into one of the stores

for Linny.

don't wreck her career.

in a hell of a spot.

I'm used to,

you take some time.

you're getting divorced, either?

today, so I thought
I'd do it from home.

what we do?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.076
You know,
it hurts me to say this,

12:57.110 --> 13:00.746
but you should let
one of those university guys
take you out to dinner.

I know I'm lucky to have you.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.030
So, come over
and spend the night tonight.

I have to do so we can spend
a few days together,

I'm on a new plan.

you covered yourself up.

You know, I thought about you
a lot since yesterday. Yeah.

I was worried
I hurt you.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.942
None of them
even called me.

To see if you'd
killed me or what.

make grilled cheese sandwiches
with a slice of pear

15:55.955 --> 15:57.923
when we went camping
down by the river.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.426

-Yup.

about taking a sort of
camping trip soon.

Good luck finding a river.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.072
I know plenty of rivers.

my email or something.

see each other again?

and the cottonwoods
grow by the river.

Well... sort of.

17:53.905 --> 17:55.508
Okay, go.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.112
There's only one road to get in,
El Rancho Road.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.580
It's still unpaved.

than your eyes can see.

Inside of it,
there's a little wood stove.

18:18.964 --> 18:24.103
A little AM radio
and a bunch of
my father's old tools.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.239
On the work bench there's
a bunch of old pickle jars

18:26.272 --> 18:29.576
with rusted nails
and half packs of cigarettes.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.510
You're not allowed
to have any of those, okay?

18:33.645 --> 18:36.682
Beyond the shop
there's a set of bunk beds.

18:36.715 --> 18:40.252
Looking out at the river
and the old, brown ragged horses
that we keep.

I love horses.

How many times I told you not
to walk around outside at dark?

It's dangerous.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.490
Okay.

who died watching TV.

that you die the way you live.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.817
Who told you that shit?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.855
Some families do other stuff,
you know.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.525
Tommie!

20:25.557 --> 20:28.260
Look, your mother is tired
from busting her tail
to take care of you, you know?

20:28.295 --> 20:31.564
And we sit up here
worrying about you,
wondering where the hell you are

20:31.597 --> 20:33.065
and the first thing you do
when you walk in the door

20:33.098 --> 20:35.801
is tell us that we don't
give you enough attention?

20:36.736 --> 20:37.804
I'm mean, God damn!

20:37.836 --> 20:40.906
Go on, take your shower.
Get ready for bed.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.911
-It's not even 7:00.
-I said, do it!

to come early?
-How did you?

21:40.732 --> 21:42.434
Seem to talk without talking,
you and I.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.869
Are you bringing me
to school?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.573
I was thinking maybe we could
skip school today.

21:46.605 --> 21:49.842
Maybe we should call in
as a kindness to your teachers.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.346
No, I'll just tell my mom
I was sick and then she'll write
me a note tomorrow.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.450
-You've done this before?
-Yep.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.951
I'm not corrupting you?

22:04.423 --> 22:06.325
So, where are we going?

22:06.358 --> 22:08.560
Got you a little gift.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.436
You wanna try it on?

22:18.605 --> 22:19.905
No.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.008
I like it when it's new.

Don't wanna ruin it.

those mountains?

Yeah.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.431
I mean, you wanna go with me?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.699
Sure.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.601
Where?

22:49.769 --> 22:51.903
A secret trip
in your secret life.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.540
You finally get
your camping trip.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.909
-For how long?
-Just a week.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.878
Not even two Mondays.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.048
I'll bring you back
before anyone starts to worry.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.951
We're not gonna tell anybody
where we went.

23:07.118 --> 23:08.855
You'll have to swear to God.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.789
Swear to God.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.023
You promise?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.527
I promise.

[David] You wanna leave now?

-[Tommie]
I don't have my stuff.
-I'll buy you stuff.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.472
We shouldn't even
tell my mom.

She might let me,
but Jesse would never.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.394
All right.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.897
Do you... like cartoons?

Listen, I'm gonna go out
to the store

24:02.240 --> 24:05.044
and get us some things
for our trip.
We need to be prepared, right?

24:06.846 --> 24:09.015
How long is it gonna take
for us to get there?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.017
Two days.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.685
Then how are we gonna
make it back
in five nights?

24:14.753 --> 24:17.388
That's why we're
doing this in stages.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.592
So we don't do anything stupid.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.361
It's actually more like
seven nights.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.730
-Can I come with you
to the store?
-No.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.365
Why?

24:27.398 --> 24:30.001
I want you
to spend some time
here alone.

24:32.771 --> 24:35.875
You remember how to get home
from here, more or less?

24:41.548 --> 24:43.082
That's for a cab ride home.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.751
I don't wanna go home.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.923
Look, I want you to think
about this, okay?

24:50.957 --> 24:53.792
I want you to take an hour,
so think about this really hard,

24:53.826 --> 24:56.762
whether or not you wanna
stay here and wait for me.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.701
This will look
a lot like a kidnapping
to other people.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.134
Right?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.403
Oh.

25:05.436 --> 25:08.406
Here you are
with a stranger
in a hotel room.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.875
But you're not a stranger.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.244
Yeah, I know,
but maybe this makes you
feel a little funny.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.212
It doesn't.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.084
I'm 47 and you're 11.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.752
Okay?

25:24.056 --> 25:25.124
Say, "Okay, Gary."

25:25.625 --> 25:27.159
Okay, Gary.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.765
Now, if you decide
to stay,

25:32.798 --> 25:35.166
I want you
to rearrange the room
like it's your own.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.636
Okay? You line your shoes up
in the corner,
you wash your face,

25:37.670 --> 25:39.305
you mess the pillows up.

25:39.337 --> 25:41.173
So, that when I come back,

25:41.207 --> 25:43.275
it's like you're inviting me
into your room.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.978
You're weird.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.212
Maybe so.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.548
But if I come back
and you're not here,

25:50.583 --> 25:53.551
I will completely understand.
There's no hard feelings, okay?

25:54.953 --> 25:58.958
What if I wanna go back, like,
at a certain point... later?

25:58.990 --> 26:02.560
Well, we'll put you
on a plane
and get you home.

26:02.595 --> 26:05.230
All you have to do
is say the word.

26:05.263 --> 26:07.098
It's an open door policy.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.102
Okay.

to come with you again?

27:13.732 --> 27:18.136
Not now.
But soon, okay?

a little time to figure out
whether or not I wanna sell it.

Never met the right girl,
I suppose.

how much a stamp costs?

cost a man five cents.

That doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

30:26.893 --> 30:29.161

We have to do a better job
of understanding the world
around us.

Don't do that.
Jesse does that.

-Says "we" when you mean "me."

would you be able
to look them in the eyes

32:52.104 --> 32:54.240

that's what we are?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.380
What's your name, honey?

38:36.047 --> 38:37.315
Emily.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.418
Emily, my name is Melissa.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.619
Can I help you with something?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.422
-Your mom or daddy here?
-Morning. Hey.

38:46.023 --> 38:49.327
-Is she okay?
-Yeah, yeah,
just a little carsick.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.817

39:23.193 --> 39:24.862
What are the facts here?
Do you remember?

39:26.197 --> 39:28.467
I'm running away from home.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.135
Is that what you think?

39:32.503 --> 39:35.072
We spend a week
and then you take me back.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.340
Close.

39:36.373 --> 39:38.342
We spend a few days
and then you take me back.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.045
And we agreed
to this deal, right?

39:42.079 --> 39:43.449
Yes.

39:44.449 --> 39:46.217
So, there's no running away.

39:46.251 --> 39:49.688
You're just like a teenager.
You're going on vacation, right?

Look...

I know your mom's worried,
but how about
we send her a postcard, okay?

40:00.565 --> 40:03.934
It'll be such a relief to her
to know that you're out here
in the world,

40:03.969 --> 40:05.536
having so much fun.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.875
And she'll love you more
than ever and you'll love her
more than ever. Right?

40:14.278 --> 40:15.614
Hey.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.519
There's room in your heart
for more love, okay?

All right.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.913
One good gulp

That way I won't get lonely
until I get tired.

No, I don't want one...

-Tommie, you've got it
all over you.

-I don't want a bath!

That hurt, Tommie.

I wanna go home.

43:40.385 --> 43:41.887
All right.

We'll find a place to pull over
and we'll take you home.

in so much trouble.
-No, you're not.

They're gonna be so happy
to see you.

tell each other everything.

Look, I wanna know
when you're sick
or when you're homesick

We have to
tell each other everything.

We'll turn around
and take you home.

Well, my dear,
that's a very nice thing
for you to say.

really knows what a father
should act like, right?

never hurt anybody, did it?

by the river.
You don't wanna do that.

if I didn't react

thought of a man letting his
niece drink a beer like that?

Then the police would've
figured out who you are
and where you belong.

they would've reacted
to that at home?

[man speaking indistinctly
over radio]

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.300
A Wyoming couple
died overnight
in a deadly fire in their home.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.168
Investigators are still trying
to figure out

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:15.271
exactly what caused
the deadly fire to ignite.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.440
[woman over radio]
I asked the officer
what was going on

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.543
and she told me that a house
at the end of the street
was on fire.

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:22.679
[female newsreader]
The folks who live here
on Hidden Mountain Lane

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:26.349
watched the flames,
knowing there was nothing
they could do.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.820
[suspenseful music playing]

[rustling]

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.793
Okay, open up.

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:20.496
[sighing] Oh, gosh.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.099
[instrumental music playing]

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:29.472

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.947
Who's that?

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:12.949
Let's go.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:14.617
Come on! Run!

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.320
Come on,
we've gotta run!

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.291
Get in, get in.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.291
Okay.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:23.927
Listen to me.
This is the biggest test.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.096
Foster was nothing
compared to this.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:28.197
If they come and go
without you being seen,

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.934
then I won't get in trouble,
all right?

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.867
How did they know
you were here?

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.202
[Linny] David?

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.083
-Hey.
-Hey!

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.918
-Surprise!
-[laughs]

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:51.588
I felt bad
that you're out here
all by yourself.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.822
Linny.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:56.693
-This is a surprise.
-[sighing] Oh.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.862
-Champagne?
-Yeah.

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.230
How's it been going?

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.132
Okay.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.302
Oh, wow.
It's so nice
to be back here.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.375
[David moaning]

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.210
[chuckles softly]

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:17.280
You're acting weird.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.559
[moans]

01:05:35.764 --> 01:05:37.934
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom first.

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:49.413
[whispering]
We were just talking out there,
did you hear us talking?

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:52.481
-Is she your girlfriend?
-I'll explain later, okay?

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:56.219
I want you to run,
as quiet as a mouse
to the shop.

01:05:56.253 --> 01:05:58.887
She's not staying long, right?

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:02.559
Am I making the wrong decision
not being able to trust you
out there?

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.063
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.364
Run.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.648
[frogs croaking]

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.989
Is there somebody else?

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.228
Just a dozen others.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.597
Kidding.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.333
What do you think I'm doing
up here, huh?
Having my kicks?

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:47.036
-I mean, come on.
-Sorry.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:50.706
Really.

01:06:50.739 --> 01:06:53.110
You know me by now,
don't you?

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.114
Sometimes.

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.016
Hey.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.628
I just need a little space.

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.534
I need to test myself.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.039
Clean up my heart.

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:30.414
It's like an old,
crowded garage in there
that needs some tidying.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:36.253
I don't know
if you can tidy a heart.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:38.521
Not like you tidy a garage.

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:48.664
We don't have to do this,
you and I, and I want to.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:52.235
I just feel like
I'd be stealing you away
from the world.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.206
I can wait for you.

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.608
I'm willing to do that.

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.545
I knew you would say that.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:08.617
Why does that make you look
like you wanna die?

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.724
'Cause I'm afraid
I made you say it.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:21.698
I'm afraid I make everybody
say everything.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.435
Of course you didn't.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:31.375
You're not that powerful.

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:33.577
You're not even at all
angry with me?

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.578
Do you want me to be?

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.381
I think I want
somebody to be.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:47.724
Well, you can't go around
and just make people angry
so you know where you stand.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.703
I think I might be
an awful person.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:10.680
I think the whole world's
out there eying on
something really wonderful.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.484
And I don't know
what it is.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.488
I can't be part of it.

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:55.891
Why did she call you David?

01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.663
That's like
when I call you Emily.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:06.336
Everything I do
from here on out
is to protect you.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.506
To protect us.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.442
Does she love you?

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:15.744
Yeah, she does.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.515
Do you love her?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.949
Not in the least bit.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.920
I'm doing this for us.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:29.359
How long do I
have to stay in here?

01:10:31.159 --> 01:10:32.828
Just one more day.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.399
Okay?

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.546
My stomach hurts.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.082
I have to go
to the bathroom.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.518
-I can't see.
-[shushing]

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.020
[whispering]
We have to be careful, okay?

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:59.323
Come on.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:04.927
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told
anyone before.

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.197
What?

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.266
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.438
What is it?

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:19.509
It's about my little brother.

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:22.612
You have brothers?

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.582
I'm telling you this
to show you
how special you are to me.

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.851
I promise.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.557
My little brother disappeared.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.826
Where?

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.796
We don't know.

01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:43.832
When he was about your age.

01:11:43.867 --> 01:11:45.702
Was he kidnapped?

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.706
I don't know.

01:11:51.039 --> 01:11:52.942
We never knew.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:59.783
He used to sleep
in a sleeping bag
behind the gas station.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.083
Why?

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:07.323
Our house
was kind of a sad place.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:12.395
I think you know
how that can be.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:17.100
Then one morning
he just never came back.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.070
Never showed up.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.474
Not ever?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.576
Not ever.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.887
You have to promise
you'll always call me
Gary, okay?

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:43.926
-Say, "I promise."
-I promise.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.101
[sighs heavily]

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:02.045
[birds chirping]

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.461
Hi.

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:20.863
Here.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:25.201
All right. You stay here
and you just hibernate
and snuggle up,

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.270
my little mountain critter.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:30.439
When she leaves,
we'll have all kinds
of new energy, new fun.

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:33.141
-Right?
-Okay.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:34.243
Okay.

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:35.511
[rustling]

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:37.814
-Hide?
-Hide.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.484
Hey, what's this room?

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.251
It's just the bunk room.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.853
Well, why don't we sleep in here
instead of the mess
that's on the floor.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.354
Yeah, they're infested
with mice shit.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:48.056
-But that's actually beds--
-No, they're old and shitty.

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.324
[door closes]

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.595
[both laughing]

01:13:58.568 --> 01:14:01.104
[instrumental music playing]

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.845
I'm gonna go get the mattresses
from the bunk room.

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.380
It has to be better
than this hard floor.

01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:46.048
I told you it's infested
with mice shit.

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:49.085
Yeah, but we can clean them.
We can cover them with towels.

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:50.485
No.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.188
What?

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.724
It's haunted.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.594
That room is haunted.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:04.734
I don't wanna scare you.
I want you
to really love it here.

01:15:04.768 --> 01:15:06.202
Me, too.

01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:09.972
Tell me.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:13.577
All right. So, the owner
of this house
was a man named Calhoon.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.979
The old neighbor, Foster,
he had a little girl

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.146
with his sister.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:20.884
And what was her name?

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.386
Emily.

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.953
So, Calhoon, he wanted
to have a wood shop

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:28.323
built off
the side of the house
to store all his tools.

01:15:28.356 --> 01:15:31.527
And he and Foster
decided to build it.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.429
He'd dug the foundation,

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.332
set the footers,
tied the rebar.

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:38.134
And Emily,
who was all of ten years old,

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:42.337
she would come down everyday
and join them for lunch.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:46.743
She used to love playing
in the yard with all the scrap
metal and all the wood.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:49.746
And dipping her hand
into the wet cement.

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:54.182
One day, they were pouring
the concrete slabs...

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:58.453
and Emily disappeared.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:02.158
Sheriffs came with cadaver dogs
and they searched the prairies
for weeks,

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.092
but they never found her.

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:06.996
They never found her
alive again.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:12.100
And the kid
is still haunting
the place?

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.337
Even worse.

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:21.610
Foster comes down here
every night with a flashlight,
looking for her.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.948
Have you seen her?

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.219
I've talked to her.

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.358
What did she say?

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.064
She says she's in love
with me

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:45.068
and she wants to live
with me here forever.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.631
*

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:37.020
[running footsteps]

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:37.846
Gary?

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:45.188
David.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.390
David!

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:51.159
Who is this?

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:53.595
It's my niece, Emily.
She's been sick.

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.430
I didn't want you to...

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:02.604
[Tommie] No! No! I hate you!

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:03.671
[clanging]

01:19:03.706 --> 01:19:05.673
I hate you! I hate you!

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:08.243
-Tommie!
-I'm just a kid to you!

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.881
Linn, wait.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.582
I'm sorry. This is just such
a bad time, okay?

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:17.485
We'll take a rain check.
We'll come back
in a few weeks.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.488
Linn...

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.289
She's my brother's girl.

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.827
My younger brother,
the one who died.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.496
You never told me that.

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:35.438
Now, that we can be closer,
you'll learn a lot
about my family.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:41.676
-I don't understand.
-Look at me.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.613
I need you to be patient
with me, please.

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:45.981
Please?

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:41.203
If you don't like her,
then how come
you see her?

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:42.470
I told you.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:44.840
For us.

01:20:46.742 --> 01:20:49.177
To keep each other safe.

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.886
[sighs]

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:07.630
[instrumental music playing]

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:12.568
This is the beginning part
where we take you back home.

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.340
But they'll ask me
where I was.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.243
And you won't tell them, right?

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.149
I ran away,
but here I am now.

[tapping]

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:54.810
Memorize that.

01:21:54.842 --> 01:21:57.445
It's the 14th post
on the 14th day.

01:21:58.081 --> 01:21:59.582
Can you remember that?

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:03.219
-Why?
-The 14th fence post
will always stand for you.

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:07.355
Turn around.

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:11.194
Turn around
and see our little house.

01:22:12.828 --> 01:22:14.630
It's ours, right?

01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:17.932
Equal partners, right?

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:24.106
I will it to you, Tommie.

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.510
It's yours.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:32.247
And maybe even more yours
than it was ever mine.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.420
You'll move her
long after I'm gone.

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:43.259
I will write you
half a dozen letters
like this one here.

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:46.595
Every single day
for the rest of my life.

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.666
And they will tell the story
of my love for you.

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:56.204
Messages from the dead.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.344
I don't wanna go home.

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:05.680
You feel that?

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.617
That pressure right there?

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.654
It's the world calling you.

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.726
I feel hot again.

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:29.765
If you want,
I can go to the store
and get you more medicine.

01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.368
Yeah.

01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:38.073
We've stayed here before,
haven't we?

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:57.460
If you discover one day
that you hate me,

01:24:57.493 --> 01:25:00.729
that you're angry with me,
that I ruined your life,

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:04.533
at any time...

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:07.735
if I'm 90,
you'll tell me,
won't you?

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:10.872
Gary.

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:14.577
You'll buy a pair
of steel-toed boots
and you will find me...

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.613
all alone and dried up...

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:22.784
and sick in a nursing home
and you'll kick
my fucking teeth in.

01:25:25.154 --> 01:25:27.355
Please don't say that.

01:25:31.194 --> 01:25:33.162
You will outgrow me.

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:39.768
You will forget everything.

[sobs loudly]

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:08.863
N... No, I won't.

This is how we said
it'd go, didn't we?

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.550
I'll make you a promise.

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.685
Valentine's Day.

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:39.354
I'll come and find you.

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.591
You'll come
and pick me up?

01:27:44.327 --> 01:27:46.028
I'll send you a sign.

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.398
What kinda sign?

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.835
I don't know.
Like a ribbon or something.

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:56.971
Tied to an unusual place.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:01.543
Or I'll break a window
like the one at the cabin.

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:06.314
I'll leave it broken.

01:28:06.349 --> 01:28:08.716
And that way you'll know
I was there.

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.055

Hey. It's okay.

-It's okay.
-[sniffles]

01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:48.090
It's okay, sweetheart. Aw.

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.625
Sweetheart.

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.828
Listen. Remember...

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.563
you have to be brave.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.565
Okay?

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:00.002
Maybe...

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.637
What, sweetheart?

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.908
Maybe we can tell everyone.

01:29:09.412 --> 01:29:12.780
I think...
I think they would understand.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:16.051
Because...

01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:19.787
Because it's love, right?

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:22.024
Oh, sweetheart.

01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:26.261
Remember what we said
about keeping each other safe?

01:29:26.293 --> 01:29:27.695
Yes.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.497
Okay.

01:29:30.632 --> 01:29:32.568
Will you stop crying?

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.069
-I... I'm trying.
-Okay.

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:40.809
A love like ours
is expensive, right?

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.813
Think of it that way.

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:47.615
We pay for it
by not seeing each other.

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:54.689
Can't we just...
Can't we just go
get a coffee or something?

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:57.826
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
This is the last chapter.

01:29:58.761 --> 01:30:00.962
You remember
what we said?

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:04.932
You know what to do
if they're not there, right?

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:09.171
-Yes.
-What?

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:14.476
I... I tell
the security guard that...

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.679
"I ran away
and here I am now,"

01:30:16.712 --> 01:30:20.215

find my mother?"

01:30:20.247 --> 01:30:21.949
All right.

01:30:21.984 --> 01:30:25.353
-And you'll be strong
and beautiful?
-Yes.

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.988
Then say it.

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:31.158
-I'll be strong
and beautiful.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:38.701
Don't ever forget this hurt.

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:41.103
Don't ever forget the things
that we've seen together.

through you...

[softly] That'll be me
whispering to you.

01:31:17.739 --> 01:31:20.175
