WEBVTT

00:01.152 --> 00:04.526
<i>Previously on Mars.</i>

00:04.561 --> 00:06.069
We had arrived,

00:06.104 --> 00:08.860
yet our journey was just beginning.

00:08.895 --> 00:11.860
With Ben gone, I took command.

00:11.895 --> 00:15.443
Mars fought us
every step of the way.

00:16.193 --> 00:18.319
They say science and faith don't mix.

00:18.354 --> 00:19.767
Open the door!

00:21.020 --> 00:24.152
If they fail, I don't care how
much you invested, we're out.

00:24.187 --> 00:26.943
But when everything
is telling you you already lost.

00:26.978 --> 00:30.069
If they fail, everyone's out.

00:30.516 --> 00:32.628
There's nothing
you can do but believe.

00:33.544 --> 00:35.655
We ignored this
horizontal entrance because

00:35.680 --> 00:37.777
it was clogged with breakdown debris.

00:37.812 --> 00:40.682
So we made one
more leap into the darkness.

00:41.401 --> 00:44.069
Easy, easy, easy.

00:44.330 --> 00:49.110
Hoping there was some light
at the bottom of the abyss.

00:49.145 --> 00:51.194
The idea that
one of the lava tubes could be

00:51.235 --> 00:55.568
connected to a
tectonic cave is brilliant.

00:56.176 --> 00:57.610
We're deploying the dome.

00:57.944 --> 01:00.610
The flag is planted.
It's official.

01:00.645 --> 01:03.150
Humankind has a home on Mars.

personal entry, Phase 2.

02:37.606 --> 02:39.239
Hi Joon.

02:39.274 --> 02:41.113
_

02:42.322 --> 02:45.556
Phase 1 was complete
and Phase 2 had begun.

02:46.489 --> 02:49.030
Medical
lab is now operational.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.489
First patient was Javier Delgado.

02:51.524 --> 02:55.197
He reported cold symptoms
which is funny because I,

02:55.232 --> 02:57.510
I didn't see anything wrong with him.

03:03.571 --> 03:06.322
Getting
things ready for the arrival

03:06.357 --> 03:09.405
of Vega crew has been
a mission in itself.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.531
A second ship,
the Vega had arrived carrying

03:12.566 --> 03:15.364
the supplies and personnel
we needed to begin expanding

03:15.399 --> 03:17.571
our little domed habitat into humanity's

03:17.606 --> 03:19.878
first martian outpost.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.966
I almost
slashed through my suit with

03:25.001 --> 03:29.489
a laser welder, but the
greenhouse is complete now.

03:29.531 --> 03:31.081
Taking
responsibility for the

03:31.116 --> 03:34.113
construction of the settlement
and the safety of my crew,

03:34.148 --> 03:36.193
was the greatest honor I'd ever had,

03:37.197 --> 03:39.161
and it was the greatest challenge.

03:39.738 --> 03:40.994
We did it guys.

03:41.029 --> 03:44.072
It took 93 days to lay our
cables in the dunes because of

03:44.107 --> 03:45.306
continuous sand drift.

03:45.341 --> 03:50.364
but as of 08:00 today
both solar arrays and

03:50.399 --> 03:53.868
nuclear fission are fully online.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.239
My sister Joon's
work at MMC was recognized by

04:02.274 --> 04:06.197
the IMSF, and they offered
her a position there.

04:06.232 --> 04:09.030
We both agreed it was the
best way to serve the mission

04:09.065 --> 04:11.072
and she accepted.

04:11.107 --> 04:12.738
Working to bridge
the gap between nations

04:12.773 --> 04:14.439
and private industry.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.406
Within two years she
was Secretary General.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.655
We're
experiencing some losses

04:22.690 --> 04:23.988
on the lines.

04:24.023 --> 04:26.571
I think it's the copper wire.

04:26.606 --> 04:28.322
no matter how hard we worked

04:28.357 --> 04:30.280
to meet MMC's schedule,

04:30.315 --> 04:33.489
Grann kept on pushing
for even faster expansion.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.322
This
greenhouse is just killing me.

04:36.364 --> 04:40.215
I'm only at half the yield
that I'm supposed to be by now,

04:40.250 --> 04:42.830
and Cygnus is two weeks from arrival.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.655
As a third larger
ship approached carrying

04:45.690 --> 04:47.738
experts to aid in Phase 2
upgrades to power and

04:47.773 --> 04:51.197
infrastructure, we sought
answers to burning questions.

04:51.232 --> 04:53.489
Search for
evidence of martian life.

04:56.197 --> 04:59.447
My priority is obviously to find life

04:59.482 --> 05:01.863
and that's the amazing adventure.

05:01.898 --> 05:04.780
But Mars was as
weary of giving up her secrets

05:04.815 --> 05:07.613
as I was of turning the
settlements expansion over to

05:07.648 --> 05:09.655
a group of experts
who had never set foot

05:09.690 --> 05:11.398
on martian dust.

05:12.696 --> 05:14.364
<i>No live matter.</i>

05:14.399 --> 05:16.129
Maybe you couldn't blame us.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.655
We had been driven by our
visions of what Mars could be,

05:19.690 --> 05:22.821
following a dream some of
us had our entire lives,

05:22.856 --> 05:26.239
but with each new arrival,
a new vision of Mars would come,

05:26.274 --> 05:28.155
and it was only a matter of time before

05:28.190 --> 05:30.368
those visions collided.

05:31.322 --> 05:33.239
Members of the committee,

05:33.274 --> 05:35.753
madames and monsieurs, madame secretary.

05:36.322 --> 05:39.239
With incredible success of
the Olympus Town Settlement

05:39.274 --> 05:42.738
over the last four years,
we at MMC feel that we're

05:42.773 --> 05:44.378
ready to go faster.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.655
With our new freighters
almost ready for flight,

05:47.690 --> 05:50.405
we'll be prepared to start
sending fifty people at a time

05:50.440 --> 05:53.197
beginning first quarter of 2041,

05:53.232 --> 05:55.197
almost a full two years ahead of our

05:55.232 --> 05:57.200
earlier projected schedule.

05:57.821 --> 06:00.447
We are really
behind the schedule guys.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.988
Olympus Town power will
be temporarily suspended in

06:03.023 --> 06:05.939
the greenhouse as construction
crews are upgrading the lines.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.613
If you want
something done on Mars,

06:07.648 --> 06:09.765
you gotta do it your damn self.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.405
_

06:12.440 --> 06:14.377
The best scientists in the world...
in the universe...

06:14.797 --> 06:17.699
But as you know,
we need the infrastructure to

06:17.706 --> 06:19.540
support those settlers when they arrive,

06:20.385 --> 06:22.626
and that begins with power.

06:24.272 --> 06:26.960
With MMC's composite
nanowire technology,

06:26.995 --> 06:30.834
our power efficiency from
nuclear fission will double.

06:32.456 --> 06:35.456
No, no, no,
you'll cross the cooling lines.

06:35.509 --> 06:36.966
The north wall sir?

06:37.001 --> 06:39.217
Power goes
on the east wall, east wall,

06:39.672 --> 06:40.883
just stand by.

06:40.918 --> 06:42.592
Electrical engineering
team please report to the

06:42.627 --> 06:45.113
outer west wing to await
further instructions by

06:45.148 --> 06:46.675
Dr. Foucault.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.217
Concentration!

06:48.252 --> 06:49.509
Initiative!

06:49.544 --> 06:50.925
Twenty years of study...

06:50.960 --> 06:56.635
twenty years to come here
and do everything myself.

06:56.759 --> 06:58.883
This upgrade in
power will be overseen by the

06:58.918 --> 07:02.908
very best; allowing Olympus
Town to generate all the

07:02.943 --> 07:06.714
water, oxygen, and physical
infrastructure they'll need to

07:06.749 --> 07:08.619
support our settlers.

07:10.348 --> 07:14.509
With world-renowned nuclear
physicist Leslie Richardson

07:14.544 --> 07:18.132
entering Mars atmosphere as we speak,

07:19.839 --> 07:24.714
to take a role as director
of MMC's Phase 2 expansion.

07:29.175 --> 07:31.675
I have the report
for you Commander Seung.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.050
Thank you Jane.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.925
Commander Seung, Commander Seung.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.175
Please proceed to the airlock
for the onboarding of Cygnus crew.

07:38.217 --> 07:40.357
Chances are we
find life before you even meet

07:40.392 --> 07:41.759
wife number 4, Robert.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.050
Are you guys up
for a welcoming committee?

07:44.085 --> 07:47.022
That's Robert's
department; if you ask me,

07:47.057 --> 07:48.425
we're already at capacity.

07:48.828 --> 07:50.217
The Vega
construction team are already

07:50.252 --> 07:53.217
exhausted just trying to
keep up with the day to day;

07:53.252 --> 07:56.054
I'm looking forward to a
little extra muscle for

07:56.089 --> 07:57.300
expansion from Cygnus.

07:57.869 --> 08:00.402
It took a month
to clear Vega crew for EVAs,

08:00.437 --> 08:02.368
we've got a lot of
experience to share now,

08:02.403 --> 08:04.115
so let's do everything
we can to help the third

08:04.156 --> 08:05.872
team make the adjustment.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.461
Listen, good luck
with the welcoming committee,

08:09.496 --> 08:10.670
I'm not gonna make it.

08:10.705 --> 08:12.277
Ta ta.

08:15.586 --> 08:18.336
So I told him, astronauts
are probably the sanest people

08:18.371 --> 08:20.419
you'll ever meet. I mean
how many people keep a

08:20.454 --> 08:25.003
cool head sitting on 88 tons
of high explosives.

08:25.419 --> 08:27.873
EDL sequence is engaged.

08:29.003 --> 08:33.219
Five more minutes Ava,
and you and Oliver are home.

08:40.336 --> 08:42.169
Big step Paul.

08:42.203 --> 08:45.003
Luckily for us,
Dr. Richardson's decided to

08:45.045 --> 08:46.837
bring her husband along.

08:46.872 --> 08:50.503
Okay, I'm okay.

08:50.538 --> 08:53.711
Nobel prize-winning
exobotanist, Paul Richardson,

08:53.746 --> 08:57.378
will be personally overseeing
a parallel agriculture

08:57.413 --> 09:01.045
expansion, focused on his own
hybrid plant technology that

09:01.080 --> 09:07.151
plans to eliminate Mars' reliance
on Earth for food by 2048.

09:09.336 --> 09:16.688
Ladies, gentlemen, our
dream is now a reality.

09:27.753 --> 09:30.017
<i>No live matter.</i>

09:50.920 --> 09:54.539
<i>Successful transfer of Cygnus crew.</i>

09:57.378 --> 10:00.336
Just want to check your eyes.
Look me in the eye.

10:00.371 --> 10:02.580
- There they are!
- I'd ask how you're feeling,

10:02.615 --> 10:04.004
but I think I can take a guess.

10:04.818 --> 10:06.664
Base Commander Hana Seung.

10:06.699 --> 10:08.630
It's great
to finally meet you in person.

10:08.665 --> 10:09.550
Likewise.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.942
- I'll be right back.
- Welcome.

10:11.977 --> 10:13.860
Don't worry,
three or four weeks and your

10:13.895 --> 10:15.693
inner ear will remember
which way is down.

10:16.247 --> 10:19.466
You know I'm just
excited to not to have go to

10:19.501 --> 10:21.735
the damn suction toilet
every time I go to the head.

10:22.509 --> 10:25.526
Nice, Oliver.
Classy reunion.

10:25.561 --> 10:27.980
- Dr. Richardson.
- Hang in there buddy.

10:28.015 --> 10:29.954
I'm so looking
forward to working with you in

10:29.979 --> 10:31.300
the expansion of Olympus Town.

10:31.325 --> 10:34.531
And, Paul, very nice
to meet you, welcome.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.797
I've read your work.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.722
Both of you, we all have.

10:40.277 --> 10:41.986
Your
progress on low temperature

10:42.021 --> 10:45.777
super-conductant casing is astonishing.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.194
Thank you.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.989
And Paul, Javier
Delgado is dying to talk to

10:50.031 --> 10:53.104
you about phosphorus levels
in our hydroponic mixtures.

10:54.402 --> 10:57.652
You have no idea how excited
we are to have you here.

10:57.687 --> 10:59.819
Well, I'd
like to see the greenhouse.

10:59.854 --> 11:01.903
Great, as
soon as you're settled and

11:01.938 --> 11:03.569
have time to adjust.

11:03.604 --> 11:05.527
The sooner the better.

11:05.562 --> 11:08.236
Of course, but
we have to run some medical

11:08.271 --> 11:14.301
tests, it's base protocol,
so let's go do that.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.903
- Some help?
- Yep, thanks.

11:21.230 --> 11:22.986
People call us dreamers,

11:23.021 --> 11:24.271
but without the dream,

11:24.306 --> 11:27.335
the reality of Mars
would've never had a chance.

11:33.611 --> 11:36.050
There's a
romanticism about going to

11:36.085 --> 11:37.508
Mars and colonizing it.

11:38.235 --> 11:42.212
And it's a future in which
we are building cities.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.736
We humans love a target.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.611
We love to have something to shoot for,

11:46.646 --> 11:50.736
to aim for, and to build
a plan to make happen.

11:50.771 --> 11:52.736
It's been the case over and over again,

11:52.771 --> 11:56.944
whether it's the colonization
of a New World, the railroads,

11:57.360 --> 12:01.069
the opening up of the West.
All these things are all

12:01.104 --> 12:04.527
impossible until we make them real.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.777
What will life be like in an

12:13.819 --> 12:16.037
early Mars colony?

12:16.652 --> 12:19.360
Let's take
some stages in terms of how we

12:19.395 --> 12:21.749
might do things on Mars.

12:22.444 --> 12:27.194
There is exploration, somebody
going out and coming back.

12:28.319 --> 12:31.750
The next stage would be some
sort of research station.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.514
You would mostly resupply it from Earth.

12:39.402 --> 12:42.069
You cycle people in and
out on a regular basis.

12:42.104 --> 12:44.111
I would contend that that would look

12:44.146 --> 12:45.872
a lot like Antarctica.

12:49.319 --> 12:51.485
You don't have to fly into
space obviously to go to

12:51.520 --> 12:53.485
Antarctica, but it's not easy to get to,

12:53.520 --> 12:56.089
and it's not easy to sustain life there.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.527
At the very bottom of
the world there's a cheerless

12:59.562 --> 13:03.819
land where the long night
is 125 degrees below zero,

13:03.854 --> 13:07.485
and murderous winds howl at
200 miles an hour across a

13:07.520 --> 13:10.527
desert as desolate as the moon.

13:11.195 --> 13:13.611
Before we used
to send people to Antarctica,

13:13.646 --> 13:17.153
they crossed the Antarctic
Continent and came back and

13:17.188 --> 13:21.652
waited 3 or 4 years before
you sent the next expedition.

13:21.687 --> 13:26.153
Then in 1954, a dozen
nations decided to man 50

13:26.188 --> 13:29.319
stations built around the continent.

13:29.354 --> 13:32.569
Now, the emphasis shifted to science.

13:33.819 --> 13:35.892
Today you
literally have hundreds of

13:35.933 --> 13:38.319
people who actually live in the station,

13:38.354 --> 13:40.472
throughout the year.

13:42.694 --> 13:44.861
There are
more scientists working in

13:44.896 --> 13:47.235
Antarctica today from more
different countries than there

13:47.270 --> 13:49.360
probably have ever been in the past.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.485
And what that means is
globally we need to think

13:51.520 --> 13:55.485
about how we'll collaborate
and manage and work together.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.903
I think it's a good model for
how policy and engineering and

13:58.938 --> 14:02.679
politics can come together
to produce great science.

14:10.569 --> 14:14.569
The McMurdo
Station is a kind of analog to

14:14.604 --> 14:16.736
the kind of activity
we hopefully want to do

14:16.771 --> 14:18.402
on Mars someday.

14:18.444 --> 14:21.655
Because McMurdo is in fact a city.

14:22.777 --> 14:24.736
This is
where you have infrastructure,

14:24.771 --> 14:27.235
where you have power,
where you have supplies.

14:27.270 --> 14:31.586
We have everything
from people who cook the food

14:31.621 --> 14:34.694
to people who prepare science cargo.

14:34.729 --> 14:37.444
We all live and work together

14:37.479 --> 14:39.569
and we have essentially
one goal and that is

14:39.604 --> 14:42.433
to support the science.

14:45.069 --> 14:47.903
What happens in the Antarctic is

14:47.938 --> 14:50.577
what will likely happen on Mars.

14:51.527 --> 14:55.310
We'll create a kind of
early version of community,

14:56.736 --> 14:58.694
and what we really want
to do is make sure that we

14:58.729 --> 15:02.402
understand how humans
can cope with the next level

15:02.437 --> 15:05.638
of risk, living on Mars.

15:06.245 --> 15:08.944
Trying to feed everybody,
and coping with different

15:08.979 --> 15:11.557
visions of what should happen next.

15:12.485 --> 15:15.235
And that's going to require
a much different level of

15:15.270 --> 15:16.944
understanding how to do this.

15:16.979 --> 15:20.903
We'll get there, we just
gotta move to it in steps.

15:26.944 --> 15:28.944
Seung, Hana, personal entry.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.319
Hi Joon!

15:30.354 --> 15:32.277
_

15:32.312 --> 15:33.814
Cygnus crew arrived safely.

15:34.485 --> 15:36.319
Medical examinations
reveal only expected

15:36.354 --> 15:37.944
challenges from transfer.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.414
Everyone's okay.

15:39.893 --> 15:43.069
It's so great to see Ava and Oliver.

15:43.349 --> 15:45.869
I think they became an
item on their way here.

15:46.319 --> 15:48.944
Hell of a place for romance.

15:48.979 --> 15:50.613
God love them.

15:51.195 --> 15:54.736
Paul Richardson seems intense.

15:57.319 --> 15:59.111
Right this way.

15:59.146 --> 16:01.611
We had hoped to have the
second facility up by now,

16:01.646 --> 16:04.271
but we've been running into
trouble every step of the way.

16:05.694 --> 16:07.652
How long
until they're completed?

16:07.687 --> 16:10.455
It's hard to say,
we're currently using all the

16:10.490 --> 16:11.896
power we produce, which is driving

16:11.931 --> 16:13.480
our construction schedule.

16:14.194 --> 16:16.277
Well
we're prepared to upgrade all

16:16.312 --> 16:18.819
of the outdated copper lines
to maximize output from the

16:18.854 --> 16:21.367
nuclear fission reactor
within six weeks.

16:22.028 --> 16:23.485
And how long would
you need to take the reactor

16:23.520 --> 16:25.611
offline to complete this?

16:25.646 --> 16:28.036
My team's
been drilling in the SIM for months.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.676
Once the lines are
laid we just need one short

16:30.711 --> 16:32.694
power cut for each junction box.

16:32.729 --> 16:34.277
With all due respect,

16:34.312 --> 16:36.861
SIM is no substitute for Mars surface.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.262
It took us three months
to install the lines,

16:40.013 --> 16:42.485
the dunes are constantly
shifting due to sand drifts.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.301
We're prepared for that.

16:45.736 --> 16:47.819
I'm sure your
people are excellent,

16:47.854 --> 16:51.195
I know they are, but no one
is a hundred percent while

16:51.230 --> 16:53.221
adjusting from micro-G's.

16:53.739 --> 16:55.819
I would feel much more
comfortable holding off until

16:55.854 --> 16:57.861
after dust storm season has passed.

16:57.903 --> 17:01.028
No, no
that's two months away,

17:01.063 --> 17:03.903
I've barely enough amps
in here to power my LEDs.

17:03.938 --> 17:05.736
We'll never
drain more than two percent

17:05.771 --> 17:07.589
of backup power during changeovers.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.569
Dr. Richardson,
if we can just...

17:11.604 --> 17:13.819
No, I
value your opinion, I do,

17:13.854 --> 17:15.775
and I know you've been
through a lot up here.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.986
But I have an assignment
and I would really

17:19.021 --> 17:21.813
appreciate your support in executing it.

17:37.255 --> 17:40.444
There are two primary drivers

17:41.107 --> 17:43.274
for going to Mars at present.

17:43.315 --> 17:45.232
One is for the settlement.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.274
Can we open up the human future.

17:47.309 --> 17:51.357
The other is science to find
out if life ever developed on

17:51.392 --> 17:54.597
Mars and how far it got
and what it was like.

17:55.733 --> 17:57.649
The history
of science in the last few

17:57.684 --> 17:59.816
hundred years has been
the understanding that the

17:59.851 --> 18:02.274
sciences that we know on Earth
are the same sciences that

18:02.309 --> 18:04.607
happen out in the universe.

18:04.642 --> 18:06.733
Physics on Earth, it's the
same physics that governs the

18:06.768 --> 18:09.433
motions of planets and
stars in the cosmos.

18:10.264 --> 18:13.899
Chemistry on Earth is the same
chemistry out in the galaxies

18:13.934 --> 18:15.566
and the gas clouds and all these things

18:15.601 --> 18:17.774
that formed in stars.

18:17.809 --> 18:21.315
But there's a fundamental
science that we do not know if

18:21.350 --> 18:24.816
it's the same out there as it
is here and that's biology.

18:24.858 --> 18:29.867
Is biology that we have on
Earth the one way to do biology?

18:32.025 --> 18:36.204
We have been talking about life
on Mars forever.

18:37.244 --> 18:39.441
It's been part of movies, and in shows;

18:39.476 --> 18:42.524
and I think it just has that mystery.

18:43.941 --> 18:46.607
Back 100 years
ago there's kind of this

18:46.642 --> 18:49.107
widespread acceptance that
there's probably life on Mars.

18:49.149 --> 18:51.691
Will we find a yellow farm
of vegetable life,

18:51.726 --> 18:53.983
or will there be mechanical
robots controlled by

18:54.018 --> 18:56.391
super-intelligent beings.

18:57.524 --> 18:59.524
That happened
up through the 1950s.

18:59.559 --> 19:02.357
And then we flew by in Mariner 4.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.190
Liftoff.

19:08.274 --> 19:10.623
When Mariner 4 flew by,

19:10.658 --> 19:12.649
it had very low resolution cameras,

19:12.684 --> 19:15.177
and it only took a few dozen pictures.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.065
It was barren, like the moon.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.732
Cratered and dead.

19:22.315 --> 19:27.149
It may just
be that life is more unique

19:28.524 --> 19:30.819
than many have thought.

19:32.691 --> 19:34.733
That was kind
of a crushing disappointment

19:34.768 --> 19:36.566
to a lot of people who just
assumed there would be

19:36.601 --> 19:38.403
something there, anything there.

19:39.001 --> 19:41.065
But, we
haven't abandoned the idea

19:41.100 --> 19:42.858
that there's life there.

19:42.893 --> 19:47.399
There's almost a religious
belief that we will find it

19:47.434 --> 19:49.441
eventually if we just keep looking,

19:49.476 --> 19:51.858
and it's based upon
faith and not knowledge,

19:51.893 --> 19:54.065
in the same way religion
is based upon faith

19:54.100 --> 19:55.988
and not knowledge.

20:01.107 --> 20:04.649
Marta,
mission entry, Phase 2.

20:04.691 --> 20:07.890
Search for evidence of martian life.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.062
<i>No live matter.</i>

20:41.343 --> 20:43.274
I have found
many more places where

20:43.309 --> 20:45.701
it does not exist.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.211
No microbes in the samples.

21:09.107 --> 21:12.569
The conditions for life
must have existed here,

21:13.482 --> 21:16.233
but there's a lot of red sand to sift.

21:18.357 --> 21:20.167
End report.

21:24.596 --> 21:26.733
I'm working please.

21:26.768 --> 21:29.526
Dr. Kamen,
do you have a moment?

21:30.482 --> 21:32.149
I don't mean to interrupt your work,

21:32.184 --> 21:34.274
but it seems to be never
ending so I thought I would

21:34.309 --> 21:35.630
just drop by.

21:36.774 --> 21:40.029
Ah, sorry I forget myself.

21:41.274 --> 21:45.606
I'd offer tea but um,
I've broken my second cup.

21:46.858 --> 21:48.524
Let me.

21:48.559 --> 21:50.024
It's okay, uh,

21:50.059 --> 21:53.022
I need to rebuild muscle
after the transfer.

21:54.315 --> 21:56.862
So you can
enjoy our tennis courts.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.069
They
might not be so far away.

22:00.858 --> 22:03.309
Every seed knows its time.

22:04.399 --> 22:06.232
I'll start with a bigger lab.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.301
We can make that happen.

22:08.899 --> 22:11.065
Within two months we'll
have enough power to double

22:11.100 --> 22:13.925
the size and capacity
of your facilities.

22:14.482 --> 22:16.453
Hana approved this?

22:18.469 --> 22:22.482
Uh, I informed her, yes.

22:23.190 --> 22:25.858
Your work is very important
to all of us and I want

22:25.893 --> 22:30.453
- to help however I can.
- Thank you.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.462
May I?

22:43.566 --> 22:47.315
Soil, single particles.

22:48.774 --> 22:50.850
Terrestrial?

22:53.190 --> 22:56.324
The spores were hitching a ride

22:56.858 --> 23:01.019
after an earthquake stirred it up
in the American Southwest.

23:03.774 --> 23:08.516
This one carried a fungus
from Africa to the Caribbean.

23:09.190 --> 23:11.411
That's quite impressive.

23:13.107 --> 23:15.814
I don't see any life in that one.

23:16.649 --> 23:18.594
Neither do I.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.307
Mars regolith.

23:22.983 --> 23:25.819
We have seen radiation-resistant
spores on Earth

23:26.992 --> 23:29.649
that can resume life after a

23:29.684 --> 23:32.352
25 million year dormancy.

23:33.482 --> 23:40.345
What if, what if interstellar
clouds of dust could possibly

23:40.370 --> 23:44.455
play the same role in
transporting organic molecules.

23:45.107 --> 23:46.774
If the
right conditions were waiting

23:46.809 --> 23:48.649
on a planet's surface.

23:48.684 --> 23:51.176
Evolution could begin again.

23:57.232 --> 23:59.455
Am I chasing ghosts?

24:01.025 --> 24:03.065
But if you did succeed,

24:03.609 --> 24:09.399
if you find evidence of a
second genesis, imagine,

24:10.107 --> 24:14.464
we would have the funding to
do whatever we wanted up here.

24:19.774 --> 24:22.024
I'm sure
you and your husband could

24:22.059 --> 24:23.808
write an excellent book about it.

24:28.649 --> 24:31.282
Thank you for coming by, Dr. Richardson.

24:42.604 --> 24:45.858
She's brilliant,
no one questions that,

24:45.893 --> 24:47.566
they both are.

24:47.601 --> 24:50.783
But intelligence and wisdom
are not the same thing.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.274
I don't care how many SIMs they've done,

24:54.309 --> 24:55.847
they don't know Mars.

24:56.691 --> 24:58.476
I'm worried, Joon.

25:06.899 --> 25:09.482
Mr. Ed Grann is here to see you.

25:09.517 --> 25:12.858
- Hey.
- Hi, how are you?

25:12.893 --> 25:14.232
I'm fine thanks, and you?

25:14.267 --> 25:17.858
Good, please,
any coffee or anything?

25:17.893 --> 25:19.501
No thanks.

25:24.486 --> 25:26.149
Well?

25:26.184 --> 25:29.274
It was a hell of
a show, committee was impressed.

25:29.725 --> 25:31.941
Can you sell them on it?

25:31.976 --> 25:34.482
I think you've
already sold them on it.

25:34.629 --> 25:37.302
The question is if they
should have buyer's remorse.

25:38.896 --> 25:40.734
How real is this thing, Ed?

25:42.524 --> 25:44.107
I've sent the
best people and the best

25:44.142 --> 25:45.389
equipment in the world.

25:46.353 --> 25:47.862
Of course you have.

25:50.118 --> 25:51.877
Then what's the problem?

25:52.941 --> 25:55.269
It's a little
too ambitious right now.

25:56.942 --> 26:01.107
Well, you don't
go to Mars without ambition.

26:07.998 --> 26:10.843
A permanent
presence on Mars depends on

26:10.878 --> 26:12.303
what kind of permanent
presence we're talking about.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.487
Are we talking about a
presence like something in

26:14.522 --> 26:18.482
Antarctica where ultimately
the long term goal is science?

26:18.517 --> 26:20.983
Or are there people
actually living there,

26:21.018 --> 26:23.155
trying to make lives there?

26:24.065 --> 26:25.578
I think there are many reasons

26:25.613 --> 26:27.621
to go to Mars.

26:27.656 --> 26:30.566
But I group them into
reasons for exploring.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.649
But if you want to stay
there and not go back,

26:32.684 --> 26:36.210
you need to grow your own
food or make sure there's a

26:36.245 --> 26:39.062
continual supply train.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.733
When we first go to Mars,

26:41.768 --> 26:45.080
we probably will be more
Earth-reliant than we will be

26:45.115 --> 26:46.311
down the track.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.524
It's very similar to the
McMurdo case, you know,

26:49.559 --> 26:51.858
it is reliant on
resupply coming from other

26:51.893 --> 26:53.246
parts of Earth.

26:54.315 --> 26:56.858
The problem
is, suppose a resupply ship

26:56.893 --> 26:58.065
doesn't arrive like it's supposed to.

26:58.107 --> 26:59.619
What happens then?

27:00.357 --> 27:02.509
On the International
Space Station today,

27:02.544 --> 27:04.858
we're literally hours away from having a

27:04.893 --> 27:07.811
supply vehicle come
up and bring more food,

27:07.836 --> 27:10.024
bring more parts if you break something.

27:10.059 --> 27:13.525
When you're on Mars, the
closest someone is to you

27:13.560 --> 27:14.930
is a year or two.

27:16.209 --> 27:19.750
It will become
necessary for a Mars colony

27:19.785 --> 27:23.041
to become increasingly self-sustaining.

27:23.959 --> 27:27.398
You know, this is what we do,
the entire history of life on Earth

27:27.433 --> 27:30.876
is one of transforming
barren environments into those

27:30.911 --> 27:32.876
that are friendly to the development and

27:32.911 --> 27:34.552
propagation of life.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.542
Until we get to the time
when Mars is terraformed,

27:38.577 --> 27:40.101
agriculture is going to have to occur

27:40.126 --> 27:41.791
inside of greenhouses.

27:42.455 --> 27:45.667
And therefore there will
be a tremendous driver for

27:45.702 --> 27:48.805
plants that are absolutely as
productive as possible.

27:56.923 --> 27:59.709
Uh, here I am on Mars.

27:59.955 --> 28:04.371
As you can see, um, the
greenhouse is up and running,

28:04.584 --> 28:06.809
greenhouse, singular.

28:06.844 --> 28:14.619
Um, the plants are adapting
better than we hoped.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.625
They weren't ready, but
the feed systems are up and

28:25.660 --> 28:29.442
running and, I'm very
happy with the work.

28:35.355 --> 28:42.292
Um, what wasn't ideal
was the, uh, was the trip.

28:48.943 --> 28:54.653
I was warned, uh, what 7 months,
how that would affect me.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.885
The landing, absolutely terrible.

29:03.610 --> 29:05.870
We knew I wasn't going to be a natural.

29:10.259 --> 29:16.485
Um, anyway, I've successfully
reared the Emmer and Einkorn,

29:16.520 --> 29:19.857
and they're growing twice
as fast as anticipated.

29:21.319 --> 29:23.110
I have received the pictures.

29:23.145 --> 29:25.651
I have some instructions,

29:25.686 --> 29:29.735
so please take notes of some concerns.

29:30.526 --> 29:34.027
Begin with the Majesty
Plant on the 3rd floor,

29:34.062 --> 29:37.693
the one labeled 15C.
It's in the guest room,

29:37.728 --> 29:40.073
I can see you forgot the epsom salts.

29:43.777 --> 29:47.347
Um, the next is the Photonia,
the one the cat likes to chew on,

29:47.388 --> 29:51.693
you have to pinch off
more of those flower spikes.

29:51.986 --> 29:53.721
It weakens the shot of the leaves.

29:53.746 --> 29:57.717
And finally, the English Ivy.

29:58.090 --> 29:59.763
Now this one troubles me the most.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.376
It's the aphids, they're still there.

30:04.027 --> 30:07.027
Can you make sure
the water's dry before you

30:07.062 --> 30:08.651
apply the alcohol?

30:08.686 --> 30:10.657
And then spray under the leaves.

30:11.319 --> 30:13.209
That's where the aphids hide.

30:14.110 --> 30:17.540
I don't know why it's so
difficult, it's only ivy.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.121
Okay, mum, give my best to dad.

30:39.395 --> 30:42.002
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

30:46.027 --> 30:48.235
I forgot how
loud everything was after

30:48.270 --> 30:50.574
seven months in space.

30:51.902 --> 30:54.526
A couple more weeks and it'll pass.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.894
Thanks.

30:59.735 --> 31:01.985
Your Emmer
and Einkorn are growing faster

31:02.020 --> 31:03.734
than I've ever seen.

31:05.027 --> 31:06.502
It's incredible.

31:07.735 --> 31:13.713
First crops raised in ancient
Mesopotamia and now look...

31:15.860 --> 31:18.568
a return to the cradle
of civilization for the dawn

31:18.603 --> 31:20.392
of a new one.

31:23.361 --> 31:25.545
I love the symmetry.

31:29.277 --> 31:31.604
Without agriculture,
there'd be no civilization.

31:32.783 --> 31:33.998
Without plants.

31:36.557 --> 31:39.110
You know, I used to stand in
the doorway of the farmhouse

31:39.145 --> 31:41.735
where I grew up looking out at
all the crops thinking about

31:41.770 --> 31:43.613
all the people they'd feed.

31:45.651 --> 31:49.651
One day, there's gonna be
rows and rows of greenhouses

31:49.686 --> 31:52.818
right here, filled with these hybrids,

31:52.853 --> 31:55.333
thriving as far as the eye can see.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.951
Without plants, we're nothing.

32:06.069 --> 32:07.675
I love your work.

32:11.131 --> 32:12.325
Thank you.

32:17.712 --> 32:19.138
I'll leave you alone.

32:25.152 --> 32:28.622
<i>Finally I don't do everything myself...</i>

32:29.615 --> 32:32.105
Richardson, Leslie.

32:32.860 --> 32:36.485
Phase 2, we have begun
replacing the old copper lines

32:36.520 --> 32:40.110
with our nanowire upgrades, as
detailed in my written report.

32:40.145 --> 32:42.818
I have divided my own team
to maximize efficiency and

32:42.853 --> 32:45.027
turnover with crews of two dispatched to

32:45.062 --> 32:46.496
each junction box.

32:47.405 --> 32:49.526
Base Commander Seung put
Javier Delgado and his

32:49.561 --> 32:52.152
construction crew at
our disposal to assist.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.456
End of report.

32:58.651 --> 32:59.966
How old?

33:00.401 --> 33:02.254
Almost four.

33:03.069 --> 33:05.777
My parents are taking
care of her but uh,

33:05.812 --> 33:08.103
I almost gave up my spot on the Cygnus,

33:08.610 --> 33:10.693
didn't know if I could let her go.

33:10.728 --> 33:13.319
Jesus,
that must have been hard.

33:13.354 --> 33:15.846
Yeah, I remember
the first time I saw her.

33:18.319 --> 33:22.235
She came right up to the
door of the cage at the pound

33:22.270 --> 33:23.940
and she just looked at me.

33:25.508 --> 33:29.729
Ears like pigtails, little
nub tail wagging on the floor.

33:31.691 --> 33:34.001
People think I'm crazy
when I talk about it,

33:34.902 --> 33:37.361
but you gotta have them to
know, you know what I mean?

33:37.396 --> 33:38.902
Yeah, I know.

33:38.937 --> 33:41.027
You gotta be a pet person.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.777
Yeah,
yeah, that's a thing.

33:43.812 --> 33:46.564
That's a real thing, definitely.

33:48.588 --> 33:52.277
Man, sometimes
I wake up at night and think

33:52.312 --> 33:55.069
I can hear her little name tag
bumping up against the edge of

33:55.104 --> 33:57.394
her bowl like it did when
she'd get up for a drink,

33:59.194 --> 34:02.731
then I realize it's just
the goddamn scrubbers again.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.902
Buddy,
you're sure you don't have

34:06.937 --> 34:08.860
the spanner up there?

34:08.895 --> 34:10.360
The what?

34:10.396 --> 34:11.568
The spanner.

34:11.603 --> 34:14.110
Ah!

34:17.610 --> 34:21.319
Oliver,
talk to me, Oliver!

34:21.860 --> 34:24.485
<i>Warning, rupture
detected in EVA suit.</i>

34:24.520 --> 34:26.369
<i> Javier!</i>

34:26.393 --> 34:29.610
<i>Temporary pressure
compensation is engaged.</i>

34:29.645 --> 34:30.694
I tore my suit.

34:30.728 --> 34:33.443
<i>Warning, temporary
pressure compensation failure.</i>

34:33.478 --> 34:35.525
I'm decompress...

34:35.561 --> 34:38.235
Warning, please assist Oliver Lee,

34:38.270 --> 34:41.650
rapid application of field
patch is required to prevent

34:41.686 --> 34:44.235
catastrophic injury or death.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.949
Medical, prep for decomp!

34:46.991 --> 34:50.560
<i>Return to a pressurized
environment immediately.</i>

35:03.832 --> 35:06.367
The shift in control at Olympus Town

35:06.402 --> 35:09.194
left us vulnerable to inexperience.

35:09.229 --> 35:12.690
On the frontier, mistakes
don't go unpunished.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.860
In trying to establish a survivable

35:22.895 --> 35:25.610
community, lots of people
throughout the history of

35:25.645 --> 35:27.984
exploration have either
died out completely or had,

35:28.009 --> 35:29.960
you know, high casualty rates.

35:30.651 --> 35:33.777
Well Mars is gonna be a lot
tougher than anywhere on Earth.

35:33.812 --> 35:35.932
Uh, with the exception
perhaps of Antarctica...

35:37.961 --> 35:43.194
It's the coldest place
on Earth, so cold that 95% of

35:43.229 --> 35:46.152
all the ice in the world is here.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.735
At one point the ice
was 14,000 feet deep,

35:49.770 --> 35:52.027
not a tree nor a blade
of grass grows upon

35:52.062 --> 35:53.532
the Antarctic Continent.

35:53.567 --> 35:55.770
The humidity is as low
as the temperature

35:56.342 --> 36:00.544
and the raging blizzards are much
like desert sand storms.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.902
Mars is probably
about as indifferent to human

36:04.937 --> 36:08.280
exploration as Antarctica
is to human science

36:09.027 --> 36:12.194
and the moment you stop paying
attention to Antarctica,

36:12.229 --> 36:14.235
and the moment you stop paying
attention to the weather and

36:14.270 --> 36:17.693
the landscape, that's
when it becomes dangerous.

36:17.728 --> 36:19.343
Accidents happen.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.351
And so when the wind is howling,

36:29.902 --> 36:32.663
when it's minus 20 or 30 degrees,

36:34.246 --> 36:37.569
it's enough to make me
start thinking about having

36:37.604 --> 36:40.023
frostbite, or hypothermia.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.194
Despite being dangerous
and extremely cold,

36:44.229 --> 36:46.504
and windy and having
hazards all around you,

36:47.027 --> 36:48.777
there are questions we can
answer here that we just can't

36:48.812 --> 36:50.559
answer anywhere else.

36:52.735 --> 36:56.027
It's that combination of cold, dry,

36:56.062 --> 36:58.693
salty and irradiated which
makes this the harshest place

36:58.728 --> 37:00.156
on Earth for life.

37:01.069 --> 37:03.183
And my work here is to find it.

37:07.443 --> 37:09.985
So we're heading to a water
track in the first circ

37:10.020 --> 37:11.737
in Beacon Valley.

37:13.319 --> 37:15.610
We're going to the one oasis
in the middle of that big

37:15.645 --> 37:20.484
valley that might support
microbial activity

37:20.519 --> 37:24.194
and finding ways that life can survive
in Antarctica is gonna

37:24.229 --> 37:26.758
help us look for life on Mars.

37:30.759 --> 37:32.419
Why
are we going to Mars?

37:32.454 --> 37:35.235
Number one reason is because
we are looking for signs of

37:35.277 --> 37:39.319
life elsewhere in the solar
system. That is incredible,

37:39.354 --> 37:41.401
dramatic, just think about
what it would mean if you

37:41.436 --> 37:43.777
found a single cell microorganism on the

37:43.812 --> 37:45.641
surface of Mars?

37:48.152 --> 37:49.343
Assuming we find life on the

37:49.378 --> 37:52.985
surface of Mars, we have two roads.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.361
One road is that it turns
out to be DNA-based life,

37:56.396 --> 37:57.903
just like ours.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.671
The second option is it's different.

38:03.835 --> 38:07.818
It isn't DNA based, or
it's a radically different

38:07.853 --> 38:09.319
DNA-based life form.

38:09.354 --> 38:10.999
And then did we have genesis?

38:11.024 --> 38:13.526
You know, the creation
of life occuring independently

38:13.561 --> 38:14.693
on two planets?

38:14.728 --> 38:17.485
And what does that say
for the potential of life on

38:17.520 --> 38:21.069
hundreds of billions of
planets throughout our universe?

38:27.585 --> 38:30.460
As I think
about the understanding of our

38:30.495 --> 38:33.252
universe and what's the next
level of connection that we

38:33.287 --> 38:37.163
need to make, that's
people on Mars, right?

38:37.198 --> 38:40.337
I mean that's where
you get the true awe,

38:41.377 --> 38:46.377
the true awe of understanding
what else is there,

38:46.412 --> 38:50.123
how it got there, why are we here?

38:51.585 --> 38:54.377
Those are all questions that
I think everybody has at some

38:54.412 --> 38:59.028
level and I think that's
a great reason to explore.

39:01.033 --> 39:03.824
Our societies value exploration,

39:03.859 --> 39:06.788
they value overcoming adversity.

39:07.627 --> 39:11.675
They value answering hard
questions in hard ways.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.804
and that's the story of exploration.

39:15.793 --> 39:17.876
The first explorers come to Antarctica,

39:17.911 --> 39:20.923
suffered terrible hardships,
and great loss of life.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.293
And those are the
hard steps that got us to

39:24.328 --> 39:25.764
where we are today.

39:31.751 --> 39:34.140
I like to think that geology is destiny,

39:35.460 --> 39:37.918
where there's the right
combination of rocks and water

39:37.953 --> 39:40.127
and nutrients and atmosphere,
you're going to create a

39:40.162 --> 39:43.315
habitable environment and
something is going live there.

39:46.544 --> 39:49.637
What we're here trying to
find in the dry valleys of Antarctica

39:49.679 --> 39:52.127
is that very brief
period at the very end of

39:52.162 --> 39:54.751
summer where we've stored up
just enough heat from the sun

39:54.786 --> 39:57.751
to cause a little bit of
melting and a little bit of a

39:57.786 --> 40:01.167
habitable environment before
it freezes off in the winter.

40:04.751 --> 40:06.669
Martian climate goes
through the exact same

40:06.704 --> 40:08.865
kind of extreme swings.

40:10.793 --> 40:13.127
Really, the McMurdo dry
valleys are about as close as

40:13.162 --> 40:15.473
you can get to Mars without
needing a space ship.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.793
So see how there's sort
of a change in texture?

40:18.828 --> 40:21.001
I think this actually may be
the spillway for the pond.

40:21.036 --> 40:22.835
So the challenge is a
little further down,

40:22.870 --> 40:24.745
that's where the water track starts.

40:29.669 --> 40:31.168
Some recent research
said is that if you look at

40:31.210 --> 40:34.793
Deacon Valley as a whole
there's no sign of microbial

40:34.828 --> 40:37.859
respiration or cellular processes.

40:39.149 --> 40:42.293
And so the reason we're here
is because I think that might

40:42.328 --> 40:44.085
not be the case.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.460
Alright, I'm ready.

40:45.495 --> 40:49.793
77.79763.

40:53.127 --> 40:55.669
We're here
collecting soil samples to

40:55.704 --> 41:00.627
take back to Texas to answer
is that soil habitable,

41:01.210 --> 41:04.682
is there evidence of microbial
activity in that soil.

41:07.043 --> 41:09.857
I mean, this is as basic
as basic research gets.

41:10.544 --> 41:14.097
What is the limit of the
most important thing to us?

41:16.502 --> 41:19.835
I think respect for life
and an interest in life is

41:19.870 --> 41:22.377
a kind of fundamental
human value really.

41:22.412 --> 41:23.751
Look at this sample.

41:23.786 --> 41:25.793
Get those guys right here.

41:25.828 --> 41:30.168
And so exploring the very ends
of our planet is worthwhile,

41:30.203 --> 41:34.751
it's noble and it also
serves society's needs,

41:34.786 --> 41:37.377
not just for scientific
answers but also for a

41:37.412 --> 41:39.271
frontier to work in.

41:39.751 --> 41:42.210
Sometimes people look up into
space for that and sometimes

41:42.245 --> 41:46.130
they look south to Antarctica
and it's the same frontier.

41:48.585 --> 41:50.751
Antarctica is a place
to look to to say well,

41:50.786 --> 41:53.048
if we can do that, we can do anything.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.627
I think of the Earth as

42:03.662 --> 42:05.276
a living organism.

42:05.960 --> 42:11.099
And we humans are the
reproductive organ of Earth.

42:11.876 --> 42:17.043
And the Earth is about to bud,
we'll do it driven by the

42:17.078 --> 42:19.793
desire to explore, the
desire to look for resources,

42:19.828 --> 42:22.293
the desire for the unknown,

42:22.328 --> 42:25.338
because it's part of our human soul.

42:26.419 --> 42:29.460
And you'll have no shortage
of people willing to risk their

42:29.495 --> 42:33.460
lives to become part
of the Mars citizenry,

42:33.495 --> 42:35.673
the first people to colonize.

42:40.502 --> 42:42.793
The first expeditions to Mars will

42:42.828 --> 42:46.043
certainly have a very
heavy scientific agenda.

42:46.078 --> 42:51.085
But once we get past the stage
of McMurdo Station then this

42:51.120 --> 42:57.193
Mars base can grow into a
bonafide human settlement.

42:57.419 --> 43:01.277
Into an embryonic, new civilization.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.460
and if we do this, let me tell you,

43:05.495 --> 43:06.835
we'll not just bring life to Mars,

43:06.870 --> 43:09.009
we're gonna bring Mars to life.

43:17.918 --> 43:20.635
Seung, Hana
mission entry, Phase 2.

43:21.127 --> 43:23.711
Javier Delgado and
Oliver Lee were carrying out

43:23.746 --> 43:26.085
expedited expansion
orders as directed when

43:26.120 --> 43:27.324
an accident occurred.

43:27.876 --> 43:30.556
Both men are being treated
by Amelie presently.

43:31.884 --> 43:34.604
Transformer 013 is down.

43:42.502 --> 43:44.835
Another ten
seconds and Oliver would have

43:44.870 --> 43:47.470
lost that arm; if you hadn't
been there he would have never...

43:47.495 --> 43:50.316
Commander Seung,
Dr. Foucault is asking for you.

43:51.335 --> 43:52.694
I'll be back.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.544
You need to rest.

43:59.792 --> 44:02.044
- No.
- Yes.

44:03.468 --> 44:05.918
We've got to get back
out there and power

44:05.953 --> 44:09.669
up those lines, Robert
and I can go right now.

44:09.694 --> 44:14.876
You're exhausted and dehydrated,
you need bed rest and fluids.

44:14.901 --> 44:16.595
Come on,
please, give me a break.

44:16.611 --> 44:19.236
- You need to take it easy Javier.
- No!

44:21.168 --> 44:24.041
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

44:26.876 --> 44:32.639
- Don't be angry please.
- I'm not, I just...

44:35.835 --> 44:38.466
I don't know, I just...

45:07.748 --> 45:09.341
Robert,
I know we have no power

45:09.376 --> 45:12.258
without the lines, but I
have injured crew in the...

45:14.876 --> 45:16.498
That can't be right.

45:17.377 --> 45:18.612
I don't
think we're going to get a

45:18.647 --> 45:21.221
chance to get that reactor back online.

45:31.252 --> 45:33.951
We had trained
for a worst case scenario.

45:34.669 --> 45:37.085
Thousands of hours in simulations.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.835
The best minds on Earth
working together to prepare us

45:40.870 --> 45:44.819
for any eventuality,
but this wasn't Earth.
