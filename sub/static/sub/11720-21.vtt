It's for

Well, I get that

it's for charity, but it's

- Shrimp-what?
- Kammie, Kammie, no.

01:55.313 --> 01:58.214
I'm sorry, babe. Shrimp-Bucks--
that is not legal tender.

01:58.216 --> 01:59.382
What?!

01:59.384 --> 02:00.249
She means cash, brah.

02:00.251 --> 02:01.517
Yeah, I know what she means,

02:01.519 --> 02:04.053
but these babies
are better than cash.

02:04.055 --> 02:08.023
Shrimp-Bucks are good every day

02:08.025 --> 02:09.258
Although some

02:09.259 --> 02:10.326
restrictions do apply.

02:10.328 --> 02:11.861
2:00 to 4:00--
that's very generous.

02:54.639 --> 02:57.206
I... I don't know yet.
I don't know.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.878
Damn it. It won't go through.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.080
Steve, we got to go.

03:07.617 --> 03:10.186
Amir?

03:10.188 --> 03:11.187

this parking pass

03:26.537 --> 03:28.337
that HPD pulled out
of his glove box,

03:28.339 --> 03:29.839
he worked at Kuakini
Medical Center.

03:29.841 --> 03:32.241
Now, the driver of their
truck says it looked to him

03:32.243 --> 03:34.643
like he may have been
chasing a guy on a motorcycle

03:34.645 --> 03:36.712
<i>when he ran out</i>
<i>into the intersection.</i>

03:36.714 --> 03:38.080
<i>If he was chasing somebody,</i>

03:38.082 --> 03:40.182
why wasn't
he pursuing them in the car?

03:40.184 --> 03:42.518
Well, he could have if the keys
were still in the ignition.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.953
Instead, they were
found way over there.

03:43.955 --> 03:45.554
Okay, so maybe
it's just a mugging.

03:45.556 --> 03:48.924
<i>Guy on the bike pulls up,</i>
<i>sticks up our victim...</i>

03:50.361 --> 03:51.660

03:51.662 --> 03:54.230
<i>so he can't follow him</i>
<i>in the car.</i>

03:54.232 --> 03:56.265
Nope. Not a mugging.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.900
I got cash, I got cards.

03:57.902 --> 04:00.102
What about the driver
of the truck?

04:00.104 --> 04:01.604
Did he get a description
of the guy on the bike?

04:01.606 --> 04:02.938
No, the only thing he said was

04:02.940 --> 04:04.440
that he was
on a black sport bike

04:04.442 --> 04:05.608
with a top
case on back.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.077
There's an
alert out now.

04:08.079 --> 04:10.713
Ran plates on your vic's car.
Turns out, it's not his.

04:10.715 --> 04:12.781
It's actually registered
to Makana of Life Hawai'i.

04:12.783 --> 04:15.217
They're one of three groups
in the state

04:15.219 --> 04:17.418
that recovers organ and tissues
for transplant.

04:17.421 --> 04:18.721
We got keys?

04:25.161 --> 04:27.496
This car was being used
to transport an organ.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.765
That guy on the bike
must have jacked it.

04:33.837 --> 04:35.504
That's why
Bruce Paloma went after him.

04:35.506 --> 04:36.872
There was a life at stake.

04:36.874 --> 04:39.275
Yeah, and Bruce gave his own

it was from a man in
Afghanistan named Amir Khan.

Here's the part
I didn't tell you.

06:18.075 --> 06:21.510
After I got separated, I, um...
I found myself in a field,

06:21.512 --> 06:23.245
and I was badly wounded.

06:23.247 --> 06:25.014
I had a GSW

10:01.298 --> 10:04.633
I never mentioned Amir
or his family to anybody,

'cause if word would have gotten
out what they had done for me,

10:07.071 --> 10:09.304
the Taliban would have

10:09.306 --> 10:12.074
They risked everything

10:13.911 --> 10:16.211

10:18.281 --> 10:20.282
I understand wanting to help.

10:20.284 --> 10:21.350
I really do.

10:21.352 --> 10:23.619
But this--
it's not the way to do it.

10:23.621 --> 10:25.420
Catherine, you got
to call the military.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.055
You got to let them handle this.

10:27.057 --> 10:28.824
No, no. Steve, come on.
I'm telling you.

10:28.826 --> 10:29.958
Steve, before
they do anything,

10:29.960 --> 10:31.326
they're gonna have to verify

10:31.328 --> 10:33.428
everything Amir said to me,
which could take days or weeks.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.796
Meanwhile, I can be
on the ground by dawn.

10:34.798 --> 10:36.131
How can you do that?

10:36.133 --> 10:37.900
I mean, last I checked,
you're not active duty anymore.

10:37.902 --> 10:39.401
You can't just hop
a flight to Kabul.

10:39.403 --> 10:40.535
This is where you come in.

10:40.537 --> 10:42.437
Actually, this is
where Joe White comes in.

10:42.439 --> 10:44.106
I need you to
talk to him.

10:44.108 --> 10:46.608
I need him to get me into
Afghanistan under the radar.

10:46.610 --> 10:48.143
This is crazy, Catherine!

10:48.145 --> 10:50.212
Steve, listen to me. This is not
up for discussion, okay?

10:50.214 --> 10:51.380
This is happening.

10:51.382 --> 10:53.315
Whether you like it or not,
this is happening.

10:53.317 --> 10:54.616
Now, either you can go talk

10:54.618 --> 10:56.752
to Joe White and help me,
or I can make

10:56.754 --> 10:59.655
my own arrangements.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.862
I'll call Joe.

11:08.131 --> 11:09.798
Thank you.

11:19.042 --> 11:21.843
Final boarding
call for Flight 421.

11:21.845 --> 11:24.746
All passengers,
please proceed to Gate 34-A.

11:25.882 --> 11:27.916
Hey. Stubborn!

11:27.918 --> 11:30.085
That's right, you.

11:30.853 --> 11:32.387
Hold that flight.

11:35.191 --> 11:39.027
Well, you didn't think I was
gonna let you go alone, did you?

11:42.366 --> 11:43.832
I got the window.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.069
Hey, what the...
Leon Chase, right?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.349
Five-O.

12:18.351 --> 12:20.385
Let's talk.

12:20.387 --> 12:22.253
You boys are way off.
I may have done

12:22.255 --> 12:24.289
some dumb-ass things
in my life, but ripping off

12:24.291 --> 12:26.391
a human liver
isn't on the list.

12:26.393 --> 12:29.060
Really? Well, that's funny,
'cause we just spoke

12:29.062 --> 12:32.664
to a old business associate of
yours up in Halawa, and he said

12:32.666 --> 12:35.366
that you are the only
organ trafficker left on Oahu.

12:35.368 --> 12:37.202
So we're
gonna ask you again--

12:37.204 --> 12:38.636
where's the liver?

12:38.638 --> 12:41.506
And I'm gonna tell you again--
I don't know.

12:41.508 --> 12:43.441
I was home alone last night.

12:43.443 --> 12:45.476
Okay, well, let's put aside
what you don't have,

12:45.478 --> 12:46.945
which is an alibi--
now let's talk about

12:46.947 --> 12:49.914
what you do have--
a Kawasaki Z-1000,

12:49.916 --> 12:51.816
which is a high-performance
sports bike, right?

12:51.818 --> 12:54.452
- What does that matter?
- Well, that matters

12:54.454 --> 12:55.954
because the person
who stole

12:55.956 --> 12:59.023
the liver fled the
scene on a sport bike.

12:59.025 --> 13:01.192
But I suppose that's
just coincidence, too, yeah?

13:04.130 --> 13:07.031
It's Kono.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.199
Kono, what do you got?

13:08.201 --> 13:09.667
I just got off the phone
with HPD.

13:09.669 --> 13:12.337
They swung by Leon's house
to check the tires on his bike.

13:12.339 --> 13:13.972
Unfortunately,
the wear patterns don't match

13:13.974 --> 13:16.040
the ones that we found
at our crime scene.

13:16.042 --> 13:17.775
Maybe he borrowed somebody's
bike. What about that?

13:17.777 --> 13:19.010
Maybe,

13:19.012 --> 13:21.846
but I also dumped his phone,
and it turns out he was

13:21.848 --> 13:22.914
putting in an order for takeout

13:22.916 --> 13:24.249
the same time
the liver was being stolen.

13:24.251 --> 13:26.918
So it's possible that
he used a different bike.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.853
It's also possible
he is great at multitasking.

13:28.855 --> 13:30.188
But if you ask me...

13:30.190 --> 13:33.224
Yeah, Leon Chase isn't our guy.

14:41.894 --> 14:43.695
Whoa.

14:43.697 --> 14:46.397
Whoa.

14:47.599 --> 14:50.335
That's a lot of blood.

15:07.186 --> 15:08.720
Amir.

15:08.722 --> 15:10.655
Cath.

15:11.924 --> 15:13.191
Amir.

15:13.193 --> 15:14.492
Amir, hey.

15:14.494 --> 15:15.727
Hey, come on.

15:15.729 --> 15:17.161
Amir, hey. Hey, hey.

15:17.163 --> 15:18.096
Come on, Amir.

15:18.098 --> 15:20.365
You came.
Yes.

15:25.137 --> 15:26.504
It's okay.

15:26.506 --> 15:29.173
You'll be all right.

15:29.175 --> 15:31.876
Amir, listen to me.

15:31.878 --> 15:35.179
Did the men who took your boy,
did they do this to you?

15:36.548 --> 15:38.983
I try to rescue Najib.

15:40.285 --> 15:43.154
Too... too many.

15:43.156 --> 15:44.355
Okay.

15:44.357 --> 15:46.023
Shh.

15:46.025 --> 15:48.159
Too many.
Listen, listen.

15:48.161 --> 15:49.394
We're here now.

15:49.396 --> 15:52.697
We're gonna get him back.

15:52.699 --> 15:55.099
We're gonna get him
back, I promise.

16:00.072 --> 16:01.806
Hey. So, check this out.

16:01.808 --> 16:04.041
CSU processed the car
that Bruce Paloma was in,

16:04.043 --> 16:05.510
and they found
a GPS tracker

16:05.512 --> 16:06.577
hidden underneath.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.179
All right, well,
that's pretty smart.

16:08.181 --> 16:09.847
I mean, with a tracking device
like this, Paloma can be

16:09.849 --> 16:11.249
tailed at a safe distance.
Yeah.

16:11.251 --> 16:13.217
CSU also managed to pull a print
off the battery inside.

16:13.219 --> 16:14.519
They're running it
through databases now.

16:14.521 --> 16:16.421
Hopefully, we'll get a hit.
We better,

16:16.423 --> 16:17.922
because that organ has
an 18-hour shelf life,

16:17.924 --> 16:21.526
and our recipient, Jason Helani,
is running out of time.

16:45.394 --> 16:46.861
Thank you.

16:46.863 --> 16:49.564
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.075
What?

17:09.980 --> 17:12.181
This ball.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.053
What about it?

17:17.055 --> 17:20.156
This is what brought Amir,
Najib and I together.

17:20.157 --> 17:23.224
I thought battlefield trauma
brought you three together.

17:23.227 --> 17:24.926
Yeah.

17:26.663 --> 17:29.799
<i>The first time I met</i>

17:29.801 --> 17:32.535
<i>Amir and Najib, I was part</i>
<i>of a special Navy unit</i>

17:32.537 --> 17:34.103
<i>that went</i>
<i>from village to village</i>

17:34.105 --> 17:36.472
<i>speaking to Afghan women--</i>
<i>it was part outreach program,</i>

17:36.474 --> 17:39.008
<i>part intelligence gathering.</i>

17:56.593 --> 17:58.327
If you step on one,

17:58.329 --> 17:59.462
boom.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.197
Najib.

18:01.199 --> 18:02.498
Big boom.

18:21.885 --> 18:23.018
Billy.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.620
Hey, it's Catherine.

18:24.622 --> 18:27.389
Listen, I need a favor.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.563
<i>They found me</i>

19:07.565 --> 19:10.833
near that same field
almost a year later.

19:10.835 --> 19:13.235
I was so out of it, I didn't
even remember who they were.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.938
I had no idea until they brought
me back here and I saw this.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.009
So, let me get this straight.

19:20.011 --> 19:23.946
Uh... you spent thousands
of the taxpayers' dollars...

19:23.948 --> 19:27.183
To get a ball back. Yeah.

19:27.185 --> 19:29.418
Yeah.

19:32.689 --> 19:34.690
Hey.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.192
All right, don't move.

19:36.194 --> 19:37.793
Don't move.
No, don't move.

19:37.795 --> 19:39.595
Najib...

19:40.397 --> 19:43.265
We're gonna find
him, I promise.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.734
Amir.

19:46.570 --> 19:48.437
Do you know
which faction

19:48.439 --> 19:50.105
took your boy?

19:52.375 --> 19:55.077
It was a splinter group,

19:55.079 --> 19:58.714
under the command
of... Omar Hassan.

19:58.716 --> 20:00.449
Hassan?

20:00.451 --> 20:01.750
Mm-hmm.

20:03.353 --> 20:06.455
Amir, that's
not possible.

20:06.457 --> 20:08.424
Omar Hassan was killed

20:08.426 --> 20:10.226
in a drone strike
two years ago.

20:10.228 --> 20:11.527
He was a high-value target.

20:11.529 --> 20:14.763
It was... it was
a major operation.

20:16.266 --> 20:17.967
He's alive.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.038
And his men...

20:23.040 --> 20:25.307
take my son.

20:27.410 --> 20:30.713
<i>We got a hit on the print</i>
<i>we pulled off the tracker.</i>

20:30.715 --> 20:33.916
Meet Jamie Kamaka. He has priors
for assault and armed robbery,

20:33.918 --> 20:36.952
and according to DMV records, he
also has a motorcycle license.

20:36.954 --> 20:39.088
All right, let's go get him.

20:52.135 --> 20:53.655
What's up, little man?
Where you going?

20:57.742 --> 20:59.608
Look what I found
in the kitchen.

20:59.610 --> 21:01.777
Is that what
I think it is?

21:01.779 --> 21:04.446
Yeah. Looks okay, too--
seal hasn't been broken.

21:05.315 --> 21:07.549
I'll get that to Kuakini
right away.

21:07.551 --> 21:09.184
Okay, Jamie,

21:09.186 --> 21:10.653
explain something to me,
please, okay?

21:10.655 --> 21:13.355
You know that that thing's
got a shelf life of 18 hours.

21:13.357 --> 21:14.323
Right? So that means, what,

21:14.325 --> 21:15.658
we got 45 minutes
till it's no good?

21:15.660 --> 21:16.959
Why is it still sitting there?

21:16.961 --> 21:18.827
Couldn't find
a buyer? What?

21:18.829 --> 21:21.363
Right now, all I care about
is a lawyer.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.398
Okay.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.632
Get him out of here.

21:23.634 --> 21:26.368
Chin, go see if
there's anything else

21:26.370 --> 21:28.137
to connect this guy
to the theft.

21:28.139 --> 21:29.672
I'm gonna call
Makana of Life,

21:29.674 --> 21:31.607
let them know they can
get Jason Helani ready

21:31.609 --> 21:33.642
for surgery, all right?

22:13.450 --> 22:14.983
What's up?

22:14.985 --> 22:16.618
We got the whole crime on tape.

22:22.392 --> 22:24.560
If that's not a smoking gun,
I don't know what is.

22:27.230 --> 22:29.565
So, this is who Kamaka
uploaded the footage to,

22:29.567 --> 22:31.166
a company
called Attis Chemical.

22:31.168 --> 22:32.368
A chemical company?

22:32.370 --> 22:33.836
Yeah, apparently
the file went

22:33.838 --> 22:35.437
to their top two execs.

22:36.206 --> 22:37.539
That doesn't make
any sense.

22:37.541 --> 22:39.208
How would these guys be
connected to organ trafficking?

22:39.210 --> 22:40.309
I have no idea.

22:40.311 --> 22:42.578
All right, let's see
what else we got.

22:44.914 --> 22:46.348
Okay, well,

22:46.350 --> 22:48.517
it looks like they've been
getting some bad press lately--

22:48.519 --> 22:49.618
allegations that
their weed-killer

22:49.620 --> 22:51.120
contaminated the
drinking water

22:51.122 --> 22:53.889
in Waialua, causing a number
of residents to develop cancer.

22:53.891 --> 22:57.226
It's a big class action
lawsuit over that.

22:57.228 --> 22:58.927
That's about
it though.

22:58.929 --> 23:00.396
Wait, hold on.

23:01.765 --> 23:03.866
Check out who the
plaintiffs' attorney is.

23:05.402 --> 23:06.802
Jason Helani?

23:06.804 --> 23:08.203
Uh-huh, our
organ recipient.

23:08.205 --> 23:09.805
Says right here
that he was

23:09.807 --> 23:13.242
the only lawyer willing
to take the case.

23:15.078 --> 23:17.446
Maybe we've been looking
at this thing all wrong.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.817
What if this was never
about organ trafficking?

23:21.819 --> 23:24.353
What if Attis Chemical
actually arranged

23:24.355 --> 23:25.687
for that liver to be stolen

23:25.689 --> 23:27.289
so that their
opposing counsel

23:27.291 --> 23:28.891
would die of natural causes?

23:28.893 --> 23:30.292
Because without him,
there'd be no lawsuit.

23:30.294 --> 23:32.261
Right.
It's a very clever way

23:32.263 --> 23:33.395
of killing someone.

23:33.397 --> 23:36.131
And it's safer
than pulling a trigger.

23:39.102 --> 23:41.670
Okay. Those two.

23:41.672 --> 23:44.540
Excuse me,
this is a private board meeting.

23:44.542 --> 23:45.742
What do you think
you're doing?

23:45.743 --> 23:46.875
Who's taking the
minutes here?

23:46.877 --> 23:48.911
Good. Make sure
you get this.

23:48.913 --> 23:52.915
At 5:33 p.m.,
your CEO and CFO

23:52.917 --> 23:53.816
were both arrested.

23:53.818 --> 23:55.417
On what charge?

23:55.419 --> 23:56.919
Conspiracy to commit murder.

23:56.921 --> 23:58.987
We found the
wire transfer

23:58.989 --> 24:00.889
you made to Jamie Kamaka.

24:08.665 --> 24:10.566
Steve.
Huh?

24:10.568 --> 24:12.768
Take a look at this.

24:16.139 --> 24:18.207
This village,
it's about 12 klicks away.

24:18.209 --> 24:19.475
Tell me what you see.

24:19.477 --> 24:22.744
Two pickups, one
canvas-topped truck.

24:22.746 --> 24:24.813
Wait a minute.

24:24.815 --> 24:26.248
Amir said Hassan's men were

24:26.250 --> 24:27.316
in two pickups, right?

24:27.318 --> 24:29.051
This has got
to be them.

24:29.053 --> 24:31.520
Yeah, they must've gone into
this village to get supplies.

24:31.522 --> 24:32.888
What about Najib?

24:32.890 --> 24:34.756
Well, my guess is,
if they have him,

24:34.758 --> 24:36.291
they probably
got him stowed away

24:36.293 --> 24:38.093
somewhere in that truck.
This village

24:38.095 --> 24:40.529
looks fortified, Cat; I don't
think we can take them there.

24:40.531 --> 24:42.831
No. No, I think our best
option would be to engage them

24:42.833 --> 24:44.299
somewhere along
this road here.

24:44.301 --> 24:45.601
What makes you think

24:45.603 --> 24:46.802
they're gonna take that road
when they move out?

24:46.804 --> 24:48.103
Because Amir
also said

24:48.105 --> 24:51.340
that there were rumors
of a Taliban camp at this valley

24:51.342 --> 24:52.574
to the south.

24:52.576 --> 24:53.909
Now, that's got to be
where they're headed.

24:53.911 --> 24:56.345
And this road is the
only way to get there.

25:11.996 --> 25:13.762
Hey.

25:47.530 --> 25:49.698
No?

26:13.690 --> 26:14.556
Go! Go!

26:27.670 --> 26:29.504
Steve!

26:29.506 --> 26:30.839
Get the kids!

28:12.111 --> 28:13.712
Hey.

28:13.714 --> 28:15.080
What are you
smiling about?

28:15.082 --> 28:17.616
Well, taking down
a couple corporate scumbags--

28:17.618 --> 28:18.850
perfect way
to end the day, right?

28:18.852 --> 28:19.718
Yes, sir.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.354
How's, uh,
Mr. Helani doing?

28:22.356 --> 28:24.157
He's still in surgery,
but they're optimistic.

28:24.158 --> 28:25.190
We got there just in time.
Good, good.

28:25.192 --> 28:27.125
He's got a family
that needs him.

28:28.729 --> 28:30.162
Excuse me.

28:30.164 --> 28:32.097
- Hello.
- Danny.

28:32.099 --> 28:34.633
Catherine, is that you?
I can barely hear you.

28:34.635 --> 28:36.001
Danny, are you there?

28:36.003 --> 28:37.936
Yeah, what's going on?
Where's Steve?

28:37.938 --> 28:39.404
They've got him.

28:39.406 --> 28:41.840
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

28:41.842 --> 28:44.142
The Taliban--
they've captured him.

28:45.111 --> 28:46.044
What's going on?

28:46.046 --> 28:47.579
Okay, Danny, listen to me,

28:47.581 --> 28:49.414
I need you to get ahold
of Joe White.

28:49.416 --> 28:51.550
Tell him Umar Hassan is alive.

28:51.552 --> 28:54.085
Tell him there's a Taliban
compound in the Panjshir Valley.

28:54.087 --> 28:55.353
I'm pretty sure that's where

28:55.355 --> 28:56.988
they're gonna take Steve.
You got a pen?

28:56.990 --> 28:58.156
Yeah, yeah. I got one right now.

28:58.158 --> 28:59.758
Go ahead.
All right,

28:59.760 --> 29:00.792
the coordinates of the compound

29:00.794 --> 29:02.794
are three-four, two-eight,

29:02.796 --> 29:04.029
niner North,

29:04.031 --> 29:06.865
seven-zero, two-two,
Uh-huh.

29:06.867 --> 29:08.600
three-one East.

29:08.602 --> 29:10.835
I got it. 34-28-9 North,

29:10.837 --> 29:13.572
70-22-31 East.

29:13.574 --> 29:14.472
What about you? Are you safe?

29:14.474 --> 29:16.608
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

29:20.379 --> 29:23.615
Danny, I got to go.
You just get ahold of Joe, okay?

29:23.617 --> 29:25.083
All right. I'm on it.

29:31.357 --> 29:32.157
We got to go.

29:32.159 --> 29:33.491
Thank you.

29:52.945 --> 29:54.646
What is your name?

30:01.321 --> 30:03.655
The woman.

30:03.657 --> 30:05.490
Where is she?

30:13.133 --> 30:17.002
Where did she take
the children?

31:16.729 --> 31:18.897
American Navy Seal.

31:50.296 --> 31:52.397
You're him, aren't you?

31:52.399 --> 31:55.133
The policeman that took down
Brother Nazaria's soldiers

31:55.135 --> 31:56.634
in Hawaii.

31:57.903 --> 32:00.972
I'm gonna do the same thing
to you.

32:00.974 --> 32:04.008
Welcome.

32:14.887 --> 32:17.956
You sure? There's no beverage
service on this flight.

32:17.958 --> 32:20.158
Thanks.

32:27.967 --> 32:29.801
We'll find
her, you know.

32:29.803 --> 32:32.103
And when we do,
we'll kill her.

32:32.105 --> 32:34.973
But tell me where she is, and
I promise you she'll be spared.

32:34.975 --> 32:36.975
All I want are the children.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.348
Very well.

32:46.185 --> 32:49.421
Know this: tonight,
you'll die in this room.

32:49.423 --> 32:51.055
But how you die
is up to you.

32:51.057 --> 32:53.224
If you confess your
sins to the world,

32:53.226 --> 32:55.560
your death will be swift,
merciful.

32:55.562 --> 32:57.529
My sins?

32:57.531 --> 33:00.498
What have I done?

33:00.500 --> 33:01.933
You've invaded our holy lands.

33:01.935 --> 33:03.301
You're guilty
of countless atrocities

33:03.303 --> 33:05.036
against the righteous.

33:07.306 --> 33:09.974
You strap bombs
onto innocent children

33:09.976 --> 33:12.277
so they can go and kill
more innocent civilians.

33:12.279 --> 33:14.679
And you call yourselves
righteous.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.087
So be it.

33:41.273 --> 33:44.142
We acted on the
intel you provided.

33:44.144 --> 33:47.245
Recon confirms multiple
hostiles at the location.

33:47.247 --> 33:49.647
But we have no idea if Commander
McGarrett was taken there.

33:49.649 --> 33:51.583
If he was, he may
already be dead.

33:51.585 --> 33:52.784
No, no, he's alive.

33:52.786 --> 33:53.985
How can you know that?

33:53.987 --> 33:56.754
Because I know him.
Trust me, he's alive, okay?

33:58.524 --> 33:59.924
Go time.

33:59.926 --> 34:01.226
Gentlemen,
mount up.

34:01.228 --> 34:02.760
All right, guys,
let's do this.

34:02.762 --> 34:05.163
All right, let's go.
You heard him, man. Let's move out.

34:20.713 --> 34:22.580
Peace be upon
those who believe.

34:22.581 --> 34:24.983
And to those who
do not, know this:

34:24.985 --> 34:28.386
until you bow to his will
you will never be safe.

34:28.388 --> 34:30.722
We shall bring the fight
to your shores.

34:30.724 --> 34:31.789
Blood will be spilt

34:31.791 --> 34:33.925
in your streets.
And men like this--

34:33.927 --> 34:35.426
they cannot protect you.

34:36.829 --> 34:40.598
ETA to helo touchdown,
six minutes.

34:44.036 --> 34:47.237
America is full of nothing
but lies and debauchery.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.907
You are a nation without values.

34:48.909 --> 34:50.275
A nation of infidels.

34:50.277 --> 34:52.844
And now let this man's death
be a lesson to you all.

34:52.846 --> 34:55.213
This is what...

35:51.695 --> 35:53.407
Four tangos down.
I say again,

35:53.408 --> 35:55.575
four tangos down.

35:56.577 --> 35:58.678
Steve McGarrett?
Huh?

35:58.680 --> 36:01.247
Are you Steve McGarrett?
Yes.

36:01.249 --> 36:03.416
You're gonna be okay, Commander.

36:03.418 --> 36:05.718
Package is secure.

36:07.189 --> 36:10.256
Way to go, boys! Yeah!

36:58.906 --> 37:01.074
Hey.

37:02.876 --> 37:04.177
Hey.

37:04.179 --> 37:05.411
Danny?

37:05.413 --> 37:08.014
Yeah, I'm right here.
You all right?

37:08.016 --> 37:09.282
Where's Catherine?

37:09.284 --> 37:10.617
Is she all right?

37:10.619 --> 37:13.686
Relax. Hey. I spoke to her
when she called me about you,

37:13.688 --> 37:16.122
and we got disconnected.
I tried her back a couple times,

37:16.124 --> 37:17.724
it didn't go through.

37:20.027 --> 37:22.428
CIA. Hear me?

37:26.400 --> 37:28.234
You're gonna need
to step outside.

37:29.837 --> 37:32.071
No, no, no. I'm gonna
stay right here with him.

37:32.073 --> 37:33.506
Excuse me?

37:33.508 --> 37:36.209
I'm not a soldier; you don't
have any authority over me.

37:36.211 --> 37:38.544
So I'm gonna stay put.
Okay, I'm gonna make this

37:38.546 --> 37:40.079
real simple
for you, Commander.

37:40.081 --> 37:42.315
We know you weren't
over here alone, so unless

37:42.317 --> 37:44.384
you want to spend the
next ten years in prison,

37:44.386 --> 37:47.153
you need to tell me
who else was involved

37:47.155 --> 37:48.788
and how you got your intel.

37:54.329 --> 37:57.363
You know, Hassan's boys,
they, uh...

37:57.365 --> 38:01.200
they knocked me around
pretty good.

38:01.202 --> 38:04.470
My short-term memory's
a little foggy, I'm sorry.

38:05.472 --> 38:07.640
Let me ask you something.

38:07.642 --> 38:10.209
Who the hell
you think you are?

38:10.211 --> 38:12.679
Huh? You know,
'cause once you leave

38:12.681 --> 38:15.248
those little islands of
yours, you're a civilian.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.984
Now, I want a name
and the source

38:17.986 --> 38:20.386
of your intel now.

38:21.889 --> 38:23.089
Like I said,

38:23.091 --> 38:26.359
I'd love to help you,
but I...

38:26.361 --> 38:28.227
I just can't remember.

38:30.964 --> 38:32.332
All right, listen up.

38:32.334 --> 38:34.667
Today, you get a pass.

38:34.669 --> 38:37.070
But these rogue ops
of yours are over.

38:37.072 --> 38:39.172
Speaking on behalf of
the entire U.S. military,

38:39.174 --> 38:41.507
you ever set foot in this
part of the world again,

38:41.509 --> 38:43.676
you are gonna be in
it up to your neck.

38:45.079 --> 38:47.146
I don't care what you
did in the service.

38:47.148 --> 38:49.582
I will personally
throw you in the brig.

38:50.517 --> 38:51.551
We clear?

38:51.553 --> 38:54.087
Yes, sir.
Good.

38:54.089 --> 38:56.556
Now you are gonna get
your ass on a plane

38:56.558 --> 38:57.757
back to the States.

38:57.759 --> 39:00.293
Make sure
that happens,

39:00.295 --> 39:03.763
these two masters-at-arms
are gonna escort you.

39:08.035 --> 39:10.136
Nice to meet you both.

39:11.138 --> 39:13.239
Take this out of my arm.
Whoa, what are you doing?

39:13.241 --> 39:14.741
Will you relax?

39:14.743 --> 39:16.142
I can't leave Catherine
out there by herself.

39:16.144 --> 39:18.077
O-Okay. Well, stop,
please, okay?

39:18.079 --> 39:19.579
Listen, you heard
what the guy says.

39:19.581 --> 39:21.848
He'll put you in jail.
We don't need that. All right?

39:21.850 --> 39:23.483
Catherine's a big girl,
she can take care of herself.

39:23.485 --> 39:26.719
Put your head down,
relax. Okay?

39:26.721 --> 39:30.323
Okay? Please? Good.

39:33.894 --> 39:37.163
What are you looking
at me like that for?

39:37.165 --> 39:39.465
I can't believe you
flew all this way.

39:40.934 --> 39:43.035
I had to make sure
you were okay.

39:43.037 --> 39:45.071
Plus, you owe me $500
from that poker game.

39:48.909 --> 39:50.309
All right.

39:51.245 --> 39:53.579
Glad you find that funny.

40:00.921 --> 40:02.288
Thanks, Danny.

40:02.290 --> 40:04.023
You're welcome.

40:05.826 --> 40:08.027
Just cool out,
we'll go home. All right?

40:45.399 --> 40:47.033
Hello? Catherine?

40:47.035 --> 40:48.100
Hey.

40:49.037 --> 40:51.170
Catherine.

40:51.172 --> 40:52.638
Where are you? You okay?

40:52.640 --> 40:54.373
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

40:54.375 --> 40:55.675
Hassan's men were
searching the area,

40:55.677 --> 40:57.643
and I had to lay low
until they were gone.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.111
What about the kids?

40:59.113 --> 41:00.980
They're safe. They're safe.

41:00.982 --> 41:02.448
Was Najib with them?

41:04.017 --> 41:07.286
No. No, but I got a lead
on where he might be.

41:07.288 --> 41:10.223
I think they might have
taken him across the border.

41:14.528 --> 41:17.163
You're gonna go
after him, aren't you?

41:18.932 --> 41:20.566
Yeah.

41:20.568 --> 41:22.702
Yeah, I am. I have to.

41:22.704 --> 41:25.071
And-and I can't come back
until I find him.

41:25.073 --> 41:26.472
Okay, well, that's fine.

41:26.474 --> 41:28.107
That's fine.
I'm gonna come back, all right?

41:28.109 --> 41:29.709
I'm gonna come back.
We can do this together.

41:29.711 --> 41:31.711
I'll help you find him.
Steve, no.

41:31.713 --> 41:32.945
Catherine...

41:32.947 --> 41:34.580
No, listen to me.
You've helped me

41:34.582 --> 41:35.615
enough, okay?

41:35.617 --> 41:37.383
It's better
for me to do this alone.

41:37.385 --> 41:39.085
I can keep
a low profile that way.

41:39.087 --> 41:41.287
It's just easier.

41:42.856 --> 41:45.358
You know I'm right.

41:49.062 --> 41:53.466
You understand why I need
to do this, don't you?

41:55.770 --> 41:58.571
Yeah, of course I do.

41:58.573 --> 42:00.239
You just promise me...

42:01.775 --> 42:03.976
I promise you I'll be careful.

42:03.978 --> 42:05.845
I'll be careful, okay?

42:13.020 --> 42:15.588
I love you, you know.

42:26.967 --> 42:29.535
I love you, too.

42:29.537 --> 42:31.704
Okay.

42:31.706 --> 42:34.640
All right. Good luck, Cath.

42:35.576 --> 42:37.743
Thanks.

42:39.746 --> 42:41.948
Aloha.

42:45.852 --> 42:48.054
Aloha.
