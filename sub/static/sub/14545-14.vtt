00:00.417 --> 00:02.917
<i>In the time of the romance
man battle in arenas</i>

00:02.921 --> 00:04.821
<i>to prove their strengh and valor.</i>

00:04.823 --> 00:06.923
<i>Winning, met life, defeat,</i>

00:07.451 --> 00:08.818
<i>death.</i>

00:08.853 --> 00:10.353
<i>Now they battle in gymnasiums</i>

00:10.388 --> 00:12.589
<i>for letters on their jackets</i>
<i>and cheerleaders on their laps.</i>

00:13.153 --> 00:16.738
Body! Body! Body! Body!

00:21.728 --> 00:24.396
The body cannot be beaten!

00:25.782 --> 00:27.266
The body cannot be beat!

00:31.621 --> 00:33.922
We could cure cancer
or win the Nobel Prize,

00:33.940 --> 00:36.558
and no one would
celebrate us like that.

00:36.576 --> 00:41.163
Body! Body! Body! Body! Body!

00:41.197 --> 00:42.764
I love you, body!

00:42.799 --> 00:46.051
Body! Body! Body!

00:46.052 --> 00:48.954
Body! Body! Body! Body!

00:48.988 --> 00:50.873
They never carried Salinger
down the hallway!

00:51.875 --> 00:54.843
Body! Body! Body!

01:00.855 --> 01:02.389
No.

01:02.423 --> 01:05.358
I can't have a roll?
A roll?

01:05.393 --> 01:06.660
You'll spoil
Ryan's victory dinner.

01:06.694 --> 01:08.962
Ryan has a victory dinner,
like, every other night.

01:08.997 --> 01:10.164
That's because
he's a winner.

01:10.198 --> 01:11.465
Winners are different.

01:11.499 --> 01:13.667
They're not like you...
<i>and</i> me.

01:13.701 --> 01:16.436
So what are we having?

01:16.471 --> 01:19.006
Ryan's favorite...
Venison marinara.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.109
I swear, that boy
will eat <i>anything</i> marinara.

01:22.143 --> 01:23.810
He really will.

01:23.845 --> 01:25.078
Body!

01:25.113 --> 01:28.599
Body! Body! Body! Body!

01:28.650 --> 01:29.733
Did you guys wait
for me to eat?

01:29.784 --> 01:31.451
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:31.486 --> 01:32.519
The guys carried me out
for burgers,

01:32.554 --> 01:34.888
- so I had burgers.
- Yeah.

01:34.923 --> 01:35.989
Body!

01:36.023 --> 01:37.758
Body! Body! Body!

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
That's the nice
thing about deer meat.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.137
- <i>Body! Body</i>!
- It reheats beautifully.

01:43.573 --> 01:44.506
I wouldn't call
this helping.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.507
You said
you were gonna help.

01:45.541 --> 01:46.892
I wanted to help,
but that looks heavy

01:46.926 --> 01:48.944
and smells gross,
and I'm a girl.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.579
Really? You're gonna play
the girl card?

01:50.613 --> 01:52.013
Shame on you, Tessa.

01:52.048 --> 01:53.749
I feel no shame.
Carry your own dirt.

01:53.783 --> 01:55.417
Hey, careful!
Careful...

01:55.451 --> 01:56.418
Of my flower.

01:56.452 --> 01:59.438
You almost trampled
my flower.

01:59.472 --> 02:01.073
- Your flower?
- Yeah.

02:01.107 --> 02:03.125
It's the first thing
to blossom in my garden,

02:03.159 --> 02:04.176
and I'm nurturing it.

02:04.227 --> 02:06.661
You tender, tender soul.

02:06.696 --> 02:09.330
Body! Body! Body!

02:09.365 --> 02:10.999
Body! Body!

02:11.032 --> 02:12.401
B-body.
 Body. Body.

02:12.435 --> 02:13.435
Body.

02:13.469 --> 02:14.403
Body.
Body.

02:14.437 --> 02:15.654
Body.
Body.

02:15.705 --> 02:16.655
Body!
Body.

02:17.774 --> 02:19.591
Dominate at school, champ.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.176
I will, mom.

02:22.762 --> 02:25.914
You have an amazing body.

02:25.948 --> 02:27.432
Thanks, dad.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.421
Bye-bye.

02:32.455 --> 02:34.856
You know, you could be a little
livelier with my send-offs.

02:36.175 --> 02:38.960
Lazy! Lazy! Lazy!

02:38.978 --> 02:41.930
Lazy! Lazy! Lazy!

02:41.964 --> 02:44.282
- Lazy! Lazy! Lazy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.601
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:54.311 --> 02:57.779
I don't know.
They're already pretty white.

02:57.814 --> 03:00.882
Not white enough. I need
to freshen up my curb appeal.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.385
I'm back on the market.

03:03.419 --> 03:04.386
Okay.

03:04.420 --> 03:05.587
So...

03:05.605 --> 03:09.391
What, you're thinking, um...

03:09.425 --> 03:10.892
Picket fence white?

03:10.927 --> 03:13.094
Crazy for cotton balls?

03:13.129 --> 03:15.564
How about that one?

03:15.598 --> 03:17.232
Supremacy white.

03:17.266 --> 03:18.733
Yeah,
I wouldn't recommend that.

03:18.767 --> 03:22.003
Very few people who can
pull off supremacy white.

03:22.038 --> 03:24.556
Let's just say I want to be
the whitest white

03:24.590 --> 03:27.342
you can legally make me.

03:27.376 --> 03:30.412
I can't help but feel like
you're rushing into this.

03:30.446 --> 03:32.080
You're making
a lot of crazy decisions...

03:32.114 --> 03:34.449
And you're not
thinking about the consequences.

03:34.484 --> 03:35.800
Really?

03:35.835 --> 03:38.420
And what kind of crazy decisions
might you be referring to?

03:38.454 --> 03:40.288
My decision
to divorce Steven?

03:40.323 --> 03:41.289
Absolutely not.

03:41.307 --> 03:42.757
Okay.

03:42.791 --> 03:44.509
That's none of my business.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.595
I'm just saying that

03:46.629 --> 03:49.164
your gums have been
through a lot,

03:49.198 --> 03:52.100
and they're sensitive.
They're exposed.

03:52.438 --> 03:53.906
They're single
for the first time in years,

03:53.940 --> 03:55.908
and they're acting
a little desperate.

03:55.942 --> 03:58.277
Thank you for fitting me
in today, Dr. Werner,

03:58.311 --> 03:59.862
but I am gonna take

03:59.896 --> 04:02.981
my single, <i>desperate</i> gums
elsewhere.

04:08.855 --> 04:10.755
Kill it.

04:10.773 --> 04:12.191
Whoa. Hello, Sheila.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.892
Didn't hear you coming.

04:13.927 --> 04:16.060
It's my new gardening clogs.
They're super stealthy,

04:16.970 --> 04:18.370
but they do smell bad
after the rain.

04:18.404 --> 04:19.605
Good to know.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.641
Dig it out by its roots.
It's weak.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.042
It sets a bad precedent
for the others.

04:24.144 --> 04:27.063
Hey, why don't we each
tend to our own gardens, okay?

04:27.097 --> 04:29.966
Have you seen my roses
across the street, George?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.369
They're winners,
each one perfect, and why?

04:33.404 --> 04:35.555
Because I deadhead
the losers.

04:35.589 --> 04:37.757
I don't do it because it's fun,
although it is.

04:37.791 --> 04:40.927
I do it so I can make
the whole garden shine.

04:40.961 --> 04:42.528
Well, I have
a different approach.

04:42.563 --> 04:44.530
I tend to think
anything can flower

04:44.598 --> 04:45.898
with a little encouragement.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.801
Sometimes I wonder
about you, George.

04:48.835 --> 04:50.737
I really do wonder.

04:52.406 --> 04:54.173
Likewise.

04:55.807 --> 04:57.358
<i>Having grown up in the city...</i>

04:57.392 --> 04:58.876
<i>I was at a distinct
disadvantage.</i>

04:58.911 --> 05:00.644
<i>We didn't play outside.</i>

05:00.662 --> 05:02.446
<i>The park was somewhere you went</i>
<i>to buy weed,</i>

05:02.481 --> 05:05.449
<i>and the tall buildings blocked</i>
<i>out all the sunlight.</i>

05:05.467 --> 05:06.750
<i>In sixth grade,</i>

05:06.802 --> 05:08.252
<i>two of the girls in my class</i>
<i>had rickets.</i>

05:08.270 --> 05:09.737
<i>Tessa Altman, please report</i>

05:09.788 --> 05:11.355
<i>to Mr. Wolfe's office.</i>

05:11.390 --> 05:13.007
Me?

05:13.041 --> 05:14.458
Okay.

05:14.493 --> 05:15.826
Tessa, you're failing.

05:15.861 --> 05:18.296
What? That's not possible.
I'm smart.

05:18.330 --> 05:19.497
What class?

05:19.531 --> 05:20.498
Gym class.

05:20.532 --> 05:22.500
That's not a class.

05:22.534 --> 05:24.335
Of course it is a class.

05:24.369 --> 05:26.671
If it weren't a class,
you wouldn't be failing,

05:26.705 --> 05:28.973
which I assure you,
you are.

05:29.007 --> 05:31.776
So what I'm hearing is,
this isn't about A.P. English.

05:31.810 --> 05:35.479
Tessa, this "F" will bring
down your G.P.A.,

05:35.514 --> 05:37.949
so you might want to get real
about your future.

05:37.983 --> 05:41.185
Shall we chat trade schools?

05:43.000 --> 05:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.801 --> 05:52.401
The fact that
Phys Ed can drop a deuce

05:52.460 --> 05:55.729
on my academic record
is preposterous.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.657
All this school cares about
is sports. They are obsessed.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.576
And why? Sports don't matter
at all in the real world.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.229
Actually, it's a multibillion-dollar industry.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.782
Students, students.

06:06.816 --> 06:10.252
By now many of you have no doubt
heard about the scandal.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.987
He's sleeping
with chef Alan.

06:12.021 --> 06:15.057
That is not the scandal
to which I was referring,

06:15.091 --> 06:18.193
but, yes, I am,

06:18.228 --> 06:19.495
and I love him...

06:21.164 --> 06:22.364
<i>A lot.</i>

06:23.666 --> 06:25.901
Ariel,
our student body president,

06:25.935 --> 06:29.554
has stepped down this morning
due to unexpected fatness.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.475
We'll be holding
a special election

06:33.509 --> 06:36.411
for a new class president.

06:36.445 --> 06:37.512
Is Dalia running?

06:37.546 --> 06:38.746
Makes sense.

06:38.781 --> 06:40.315
The only criteria for being
on the student body

06:40.349 --> 06:42.684
seems to be
having a good body.

06:42.718 --> 06:43.868
Hey, you guys.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.222
As you all know,
Kenzie and Kaitlyn are mad fit.

06:47.256 --> 06:51.392
Their bodies are tight,
and so is their platform.

06:51.426 --> 06:55.563
Hey, you guys.
I'm Kenzie. She's Kaitlyn.

06:55.598 --> 06:58.933
Hey. You guys,
there's a lot of fat kids,

06:58.968 --> 07:02.470
and sports is
what makes them <i>unfat.</i>

07:02.928 --> 07:04.194
There are a lot of smart kids

07:04.229 --> 07:06.931
that would argue
that "unfat" isn't a word.

07:06.965 --> 07:10.317
That's why we propose doubling
the current gym requirement...

07:10.352 --> 07:12.603
To double what it is now.

07:12.637 --> 07:13.871
What?

07:13.905 --> 07:15.072
They're talking
about cutting academics

07:15.106 --> 07:17.007
so we can chase a ball
around?

07:17.041 --> 07:19.376
Thin twins for the win!

07:19.394 --> 07:22.062
Vote for them, you guys.
I mean it.

07:22.097 --> 07:25.449
Okay. Thank you, ladies.

07:26.495 --> 07:29.897
Now if anyone wants to oppose
the thin twin ticket,

07:29.915 --> 07:30.865
- see me and...
- I oppose.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.767
I oppose everything
they stand for.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.336
What are you saying, Tessa,

07:34.370 --> 07:36.471
that you want to run
for student body president?

07:36.505 --> 07:38.606
- That's... exactly what I'm saying.
-  My God.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.859
She cannot run
for student body president.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.495
She wears layers. I mean,
you can't even see her body.

07:44.686 --> 07:47.538
<i>My body may not have been</i>
the <i>body,</i>

07:47.572 --> 07:49.857
<i>but it was up for a fight,</i>

07:49.891 --> 07:53.193
<i>and sometimes,</i>
<i>as Ryan Shay was learning,</i>

07:53.261 --> 07:55.929
<i>the scrappy ones</i>
<i>will surprise you.</i>

08:10.495 --> 08:11.595
Sheila.

08:11.646 --> 08:12.846
I can't tell you
how shocked

08:12.881 --> 08:14.681
Jill and I were
to hear the news.

08:14.716 --> 08:18.318
Jill likes to feel in private,
so she's home.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.838
Me... I'll feel anywhere.

08:20.872 --> 08:22.189
Can I see the body?

08:22.223 --> 08:23.991
We're not doing that.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.660
We want people to remember Ryan
like he was.

08:26.694 --> 08:28.061
Perfect.

08:28.096 --> 08:29.329
Hi.

08:34.785 --> 08:36.953
Excuse me.

08:38.722 --> 08:41.558
So... you went ahead
and did it,

08:41.576 --> 08:43.493
Back-alley bleaching.
Is that what I'm looking at?!

08:43.528 --> 08:44.795
You bit the trays.
You hit the strips.

08:44.829 --> 08:47.363
You betcha,
and I'm glad I did.

08:47.381 --> 08:48.632
You may not agree
with my decision,

08:48.666 --> 08:51.067
but it's my decision,
not yours.

08:51.102 --> 08:53.302
Why don't you come out
and say it, Noah?

08:53.390 --> 08:54.823
You're on his side.

08:54.858 --> 08:56.525
We were all at brunch
a month ago.

08:56.559 --> 08:58.160
The four of us shared
two desserts.

08:58.194 --> 08:59.628
I like doing that.

08:59.663 --> 09:01.613
You get to taste
a little bit of each one.

09:01.648 --> 09:04.600
Well, Steven was tasting
a lot more than dessert.

09:04.634 --> 09:06.986
I love you dearly, Noah,
but this isn't about you.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.704
Steven and I are over,

09:08.738 --> 09:12.608
so update my file
and move on.

09:15.762 --> 09:17.146
What did she bring?

09:17.180 --> 09:18.347
Trouble.

09:18.381 --> 09:19.948
And ambrosia!

09:23.994 --> 09:26.629
Hey. What's going on?

09:26.663 --> 09:28.964
I-I actually just stopped by
to borrow your rake.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.132
What happened?

09:30.166 --> 09:33.135
It's Ryan, our favorite rake.

09:33.169 --> 09:34.937
Of course, I'm using the British
regency-era definition...

09:34.971 --> 09:36.338
It's not
the time to showboat, Fred.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.223
I thought Ryan just tore
his A.C.L.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.209
You know what, Sheila?
This is your big chance.

09:40.243 --> 09:41.860
I know how
you love perfection,

09:41.895 --> 09:43.145
but, look,
not everything in life

09:43.179 --> 09:44.246
is perfect, right?

09:45.582 --> 09:47.716
You can't deadhead
your own son.

09:59.212 --> 10:01.914
Candidates, if you are ready,

10:01.948 --> 10:05.050
we will begin the first
of one of our 12 debates.

10:05.084 --> 10:06.218
12?

10:06.252 --> 10:07.419
First question
for the candidates...

10:07.453 --> 10:10.105
"Why you so fly, though?"

10:10.156 --> 10:13.057
Kenzie, Kaitlyn, you guys
will be answering first.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.040
Thanks, Mr. Wolfe.

10:16.091 --> 10:18.642
We wrote
a song for Ryan Shay...

10:18.693 --> 10:21.045
And we hope it will get
you up out of your chair

10:21.079 --> 10:22.997
and dancing to it in no time.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.304
<i> Your body</i>

10:30.338 --> 10:32.640
<i> was the body</i>

10:32.674 --> 10:35.826
<i> till your body</i>

10:35.877 --> 10:38.479
<i> hit the floor</i>

10:38.513 --> 10:40.180
<i> now your body</i>

10:40.215 --> 10:43.133
<i> is no body</i>

10:43.184 --> 10:45.152
<i> but we know</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:47.421
<i> you'll wrestle more</i>

10:47.455 --> 10:49.006
<i> and more</i>

10:49.057 --> 10:50.024
<i> and more</i>

10:50.058 --> 10:52.109
<i> and more and more</i>

10:52.143 --> 10:55.695
<i> and more and more and more
and more and more! </i>

10:59.989 --> 11:02.924
Thanks, everyone.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.126
Tessa, rebuttal?

11:09.698 --> 11:12.700
What makes a hero?

11:13.736 --> 11:15.637
Thank you
for the support.

11:18.057 --> 11:20.775
I know you all think
Ryan's a hero,

11:20.809 --> 11:22.276
but what about...

11:24.944 --> 11:26.027
Evan?

11:26.078 --> 11:28.413
Does anybody care

11:28.431 --> 11:34.002
that <i>Evan</i> got a <i>perfect</i> score
on his P.S.A.T.s?

11:34.036 --> 11:36.654
No one wrote a song
about <i>that...</i>

11:37.940 --> 11:39.490
Except me.

11:39.508 --> 11:41.292
She's going off book.

11:41.327 --> 11:46.998
<i> Evan</i>

11:47.032 --> 11:49.066
<i> math and vocab</i>

11:49.085 --> 11:51.936
<i> are like heaven</i>

11:51.971 --> 11:54.539
<i> to Evan</i>

11:58.974 --> 11:59.991
Is there a bridge?

12:00.042 --> 12:03.010
There is too much emphasis
on stupid sports

12:03.044 --> 12:04.378
and stupid people.

12:04.413 --> 12:08.482
Ryan's not a hero.
He got hurt while <i>wrestling.</i>

12:08.517 --> 12:11.419
Wrestling is dumb.

12:11.453 --> 12:14.488
Academics are the opposite
of dumb.

12:14.523 --> 12:17.425
If you elect me, I promise,
I will not let

12:17.459 --> 12:21.128
physical education eclipse
actual education.

12:21.163 --> 12:23.698
I propose we make gym
an elective,

12:23.732 --> 12:25.967
and I'm just asking

12:26.001 --> 12:28.202
that you think about it.

12:31.937 --> 12:34.455
More sugar snap peas, honey?

12:36.425 --> 12:38.393
Sorry. Are you...
Are you talking to me?

12:38.427 --> 12:40.461
Of course I am, silly.

12:40.495 --> 12:41.896
Do you want
some more sugar snap peas?

12:41.930 --> 12:42.864
I noticed you finished yours.

12:42.898 --> 12:44.532
I did finish mine.

12:45.968 --> 12:50.705
Anything exciting happen
at school today?

12:50.739 --> 12:55.843
Well, I'm running
Tessa's campaign

12:55.878 --> 12:57.145
for student body president.

12:57.179 --> 12:59.914
Our Lisa,
a political mastermind.

12:59.948 --> 13:01.883
I smell a victory dinner
in the future,

13:01.917 --> 13:03.885
and it smells like...

13:04.766 --> 13:07.167
It smells like...

13:08.203 --> 13:09.787
Tuna and shells?

13:09.821 --> 13:11.272
You got it, genius.

13:11.306 --> 13:13.007
Tuna and shells it is.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.610
Lisa, would you like to eat
Ryan's dessert tonight?

13:16.628 --> 13:17.811
I doubt he'll want to eat

13:17.846 --> 13:20.380
this crumbly mess
up in his room.

13:34.329 --> 13:35.295
Mr. Altman?

13:35.313 --> 13:37.464
Hey.

13:37.482 --> 13:40.601
Ryan, did you wheel
over here all by yourself?

13:40.635 --> 13:43.137
Down the stairs
and everything?

13:43.171 --> 13:44.305
I heard what you said
to my mother,

13:44.339 --> 13:46.273
so I know there's room
in your heart,

13:46.308 --> 13:48.476
but is there room
in your house

13:48.510 --> 13:50.978
for a dude in a chair
that rolls?

13:51.012 --> 13:54.315
And if so, is there
a downstairs bathroom I can use?

14:04.612 --> 14:05.745
Wrestling is a sport.

14:06.672 --> 14:08.205
It's not an identity.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.390
What about Lacrosse?

14:09.424 --> 14:11.258
Also a sport.

14:11.293 --> 14:12.810
What about Spider-Man?

14:12.844 --> 14:14.679
Right.
That's a secret identity

14:14.713 --> 14:17.114
but unrelated
to what I'm talking about.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.783
See, you need to start
thinking about...

14:19.818 --> 14:21.802
What makes you who you are.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.934
My hair. My eyes. My Roman nose.

14:25.935 --> 14:27.324
On the inside.

14:27.342 --> 14:30.194
- My lungs. My awesome liver.
- What you believe in.

14:30.228 --> 14:31.562
Santa Claus.
Tupac Shakur.

14:31.596 --> 14:32.863
You don't have to answer
the questions

14:32.898 --> 14:34.265
the second I ask them,
okay?

14:38.737 --> 14:41.472
Okay.

14:44.326 --> 14:46.277
So serene.

14:46.311 --> 14:49.563
Yeah. And calm, too.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.085
Hey, look at this guy.

14:54.119 --> 14:56.120
He's a tall, stocky guy,

14:56.154 --> 14:58.756
and he's painting, you know?
Painting.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.024
He's a painter.

15:00.092 --> 15:02.226
Former firefighter, actually.

15:02.260 --> 15:06.030
Used to think it was the only
reason I was on planet Earth,

15:06.064 --> 15:08.165
but then the floor collapsed
right underneath me,

15:08.200 --> 15:09.967
and I fell two stories.

15:10.001 --> 15:12.335
I cracked my back up
pretty good.

15:12.509 --> 15:14.209
You mean pretty <i>bad.</i>

15:14.244 --> 15:18.080
I cracked it... pretty bad.
It hurt pretty good.

15:18.114 --> 15:19.481
You mean
it hurt pretty <i>bad.</i>

15:19.516 --> 15:21.517
Is that from the injury?

15:21.551 --> 15:23.552
Ryan, I'm just glad
this man discovered

15:23.586 --> 15:27.106
after his life-changing
accident,

15:27.157 --> 15:29.491
that he had
another amazing gift.

15:29.509 --> 15:31.393
He could start fires
with his mind?

15:31.925 --> 15:32.432
What? No.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.459
The painting.
I'm talking about the painting.

15:35.762 --> 15:36.829
It's just,
you said "amazing gift,"

15:36.863 --> 15:40.365
so I was thinking
more along those lines.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.301
Tessa, I beg you.
Please let me do my job.

15:42.335 --> 15:44.135
I'm doing
damage control here.

15:44.153 --> 15:46.738
Polls show that people
think you're a racist.

15:46.772 --> 15:48.540
- Racist? That's crazy.
- Against jocks.

15:48.575 --> 15:49.708
That's not a race!

15:49.742 --> 15:50.959
Tessa, frankly,
that's the kind of talk

15:50.994 --> 15:53.245
that got us here
in the first place.

15:53.279 --> 15:54.396
If you lower your voice,

15:54.430 --> 15:55.981
I'm trying to spin this
into an asset.

15:56.015 --> 15:59.050
You know what, Lisa?

15:59.068 --> 16:00.485
I-I'm not sure
this is worth it.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.204
This is a fight that
I don't think we're gonna win.

16:02.255 --> 16:03.222
No, you listen to me.

16:04.691 --> 16:06.158
I am this close to
my very own victory dinner,

16:06.192 --> 16:08.827
and I'll be hot-damned if you're
gonna take that away from me.

16:08.862 --> 16:10.429
This is my moment.

16:10.463 --> 16:13.332
This is
my tuna and my shells.

16:13.366 --> 16:15.567
<i>Dad's flower wasn't</i>
<i>the only thing blossoming.</i>

16:15.602 --> 16:19.638
<i>His friendship with Ryan Shay</i>
<i>had also taken root.</i>

16:19.672 --> 16:22.174
<i> In the desert</i>

16:22.208 --> 16:23.909
<i> you can't remember
your name </i>

16:23.943 --> 16:27.846
<i> 'cause they're ain't no one
for to cause you no pain </i>

16:36.031 --> 16:38.783
That's great stuff,
Mr. Altman.

16:38.817 --> 16:40.251
Thanks. I actually...

16:40.286 --> 16:42.654
I had a band in college...
Alt-Man.

16:42.688 --> 16:44.872
Like Altman, get it?

16:44.907 --> 16:46.357
No, but I trust you.

16:47.626 --> 16:48.810
Were you famous?

16:48.844 --> 16:50.028
It wasn't about
the fame.

16:50.062 --> 16:52.596
- So you weren't?
- No.

16:52.615 --> 16:53.781
We played covers, mostly.

16:53.816 --> 16:55.116
I always wanted
to do our own stuff.

16:55.167 --> 16:59.220
I tried to write a few songs,
but... you know,

16:59.254 --> 17:01.372
- life got in the way.
- Yeah.

17:01.407 --> 17:05.310
Thanks for spending all
this time with me, Mr. Alt-Man.

17:05.344 --> 17:07.645
I just got it.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.214
Good one.

17:10.249 --> 17:12.083
I think I know what
you've been trying to do,

17:12.117 --> 17:13.818
and it worked.

17:13.852 --> 17:14.986
- It did?
- Yeah.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.762
If I don't toughen up,

17:17.797 --> 17:20.398
I'm gonna turn into some
soft loser sitting around

17:20.433 --> 17:22.768
singing depressing songs
about a horse with no mane.

17:22.801 --> 17:23.902
Yeah, that's not what
that song was...

17:23.936 --> 17:26.171
So I'm gonna play
through the pain.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.573
Even if it kills me,
at least I'll die a man.

17:28.608 --> 17:30.575
Can't lick my wounds.

17:30.609 --> 17:32.210
I have to kick 'em, right?

17:32.245 --> 17:33.945
- What are you doing?
- Kick 'em!

17:33.963 --> 17:35.964
- Kick 'em!
- Ryan...

17:35.999 --> 17:37.966
I can do it.

17:43.006 --> 17:45.623
No!

17:46.859 --> 17:49.194
Whoa.

17:51.597 --> 17:53.482
You're walking.

17:53.516 --> 17:56.801
I did it.

18:01.207 --> 18:02.808
Yes, you did.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.221
<i> Never got you,
so you'd say </i>

18:11.235 --> 18:15.905
<i> but I tried all that
really warm month of may </i>

18:17.859 --> 18:21.011
<i> girl</i>

18:22.841 --> 18:24.192
Whatcha doin'?

18:24.226 --> 18:27.195
Hey. Nothing. Just noodling
with the song I started writing

18:27.229 --> 18:28.930
a hundred years ago
and never finished.

18:28.964 --> 18:31.399
Wait a minute.
Did the Alt-Man return?

18:31.433 --> 18:34.101
You know,
I just...

18:34.119 --> 18:36.771
I thought that maybe
he should, you know...

18:36.805 --> 18:39.407
<i> Play through the pain</i>

18:39.441 --> 18:41.175
Sounds good.

18:41.210 --> 18:43.544
Thanks.
Hey, what are you doing?

18:43.579 --> 18:44.846
I'm not fit to serve.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.114
What? You're giving up?

18:46.148 --> 18:48.149
They came out
with this whole slander thing,

18:48.183 --> 18:51.919
saying I'm racist
against jocks.

18:51.954 --> 18:53.254
So stupid.
I can't be bothered.

18:53.289 --> 18:54.806
I'm never gonna
change these people.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.958
You know,
when you were little,

18:56.992 --> 18:58.660
I may not have impressed this
upon you enough, but I think

18:58.694 --> 19:01.362
it's really important
to fight for what you want.

19:01.397 --> 19:04.198
Don't take the easy road.

19:04.233 --> 19:05.967
- Are you gonna sing again?
- No.

19:06.001 --> 19:06.968
It feels like you are.

19:07.002 --> 19:10.638
<i> Don't take the easy road</i>

19:10.656 --> 19:14.442
<i> even if you've got
a heavy load </i>

19:14.476 --> 19:16.644
I'm just riffing, but I think
I got something here.

19:16.679 --> 19:17.745
I'm almost considering doing

19:17.780 --> 19:19.480
three or four
"yeah, yeah, yeahs."

19:19.498 --> 19:21.249
Those are optional. I'm not
married to the "yeahs."

19:21.283 --> 19:22.850
I was thinking something
like...

19:22.885 --> 19:26.187
<i>As George figured out</i>
<i>his "yeah, yeah, yeahs,"</i>

19:26.221 --> 19:29.090
<i>i realized that maybe I had</i>
<i>been taking the easy road,</i>

19:29.124 --> 19:33.177
<i>not by quitting the election,</i>
<i>but by running at all.</i>

19:33.212 --> 19:36.130
Sorry, Lisa.
It's over.

19:36.164 --> 19:37.432
Is it about
the poll numbers?

19:37.466 --> 19:38.599
Because I'm said
I'm not worried.

19:38.634 --> 19:42.103
The only reason I even ran
for student council

19:42.137 --> 19:45.540
was to avoid
spiking a volleyball.

19:50.579 --> 19:51.863
What about
my victory dinner?

19:51.897 --> 19:54.198
Actually...

19:54.233 --> 19:55.783
I made a deal with the twins.

19:55.818 --> 19:57.952
I agreed to withdraw
my name from the ballot

19:57.986 --> 19:59.354
and support their ticket...

19:59.388 --> 20:03.124
In exchange for us letting <i>you</i>
be our new campaign manager.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.709
Dalia got bored.

20:06.995 --> 20:10.882
Can you taste
that tuna and shells?

20:12.551 --> 20:14.335
Hey.

20:14.370 --> 20:15.370
Hey.

20:15.404 --> 20:16.587
If you show me
how to spike a volleyball,

20:16.638 --> 20:18.473
I'll do
your science homework.

20:18.507 --> 20:20.725
I don't need you to do
my science homework, weakling.

20:20.759 --> 20:23.010
My grades are perfect.

20:23.929 --> 20:25.880
- They are?
-  Heads up!

20:25.948 --> 20:27.565
I said heads up!

20:29.184 --> 20:32.019
<i>Maybe you</i> can
<i>change yourself...</i>

20:32.053 --> 20:35.056
<i>But not on the first try.</i>

20:37.960 --> 20:39.260
Not till he's home.

20:39.294 --> 20:44.232
Body! Body! Body! Body! Body!

20:44.266 --> 20:45.233
Body!

20:45.267 --> 20:47.835
I'm back.
The king is back!

20:47.870 --> 20:49.270
Way to go, son.

20:49.304 --> 20:51.472
- Attaboy!
- Thanks, guys.

20:51.507 --> 20:54.408
Feels a lot better being carried
when you know you can walk.

20:57.412 --> 21:01.315
Great. What are we having
for dinner, possum marinara?

21:03.051 --> 21:07.321
Tuna and shells. I requested it
'cause I know it's your fave.

21:07.356 --> 21:08.890
But...

21:08.924 --> 21:11.225
Being useless and unpopular
