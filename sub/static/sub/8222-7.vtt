WEBVTT

00:03.450 --> 00:06.578
NARRATOR: On this high-flying
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:08.255 --> 00:09.745
[Laughter]

00:10.324 --> 00:12.690
One word for this... splat!

00:12.759 --> 00:15.990
NARRATOR: The whole team
tackles one massive myth.

00:16.062 --> 00:18.623
Everything in your mind
is saying, "Don't do it."

00:18.699 --> 00:22.066
NARRATOR: Testing the tale of
a spectacular midair mishap...

00:22.869 --> 00:24.063
[Laughing]

00:24.971 --> 00:26.836
...pushes everyone to the limit.

00:26.907 --> 00:27.737
[Grunting]

00:27.808 --> 00:29.901
This whole story
is just totally absurd.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.244
NARRATOR:
They'll need luck...

00:32.311 --> 00:33.142
For science.

00:33.213 --> 00:35.545
- Aaaah!
- NARRATOR: Courage...

00:35.615 --> 00:38.140
Ah!
This is the best data ever!

00:38.218 --> 00:40.243
NARRATOR:
...and some serious science...

00:41.054 --> 00:42.043
That's perfect.

00:42.122 --> 00:45.319
NARRATOR: To tackle the myth
of the man who fell to earth...

00:45.392 --> 00:46.416
Grant, take it away.

00:47.227 --> 00:51.357
NARRATOR: Struck a seesaw,
and launched a legend.

00:57.971 --> 01:00.838
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:00.907 --> 01:02.374
Adam Savage...

01:02.442 --> 01:04.307
True and fancy-free

01:04.378 --> 01:05.436
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:05.512 --> 01:06.410
[Grunts]

01:06.480 --> 01:08.607
You just need
a little extra lubrication.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.673
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:10.751 --> 01:12.343
of special-effects experience.

01:12.419 --> 01:14.387
I'm taking me Jamie
out for a walk.

01:14.454 --> 01:17.582
NARRATOR:
Joining them... Tory Belleci...

01:17.657 --> 01:18.715
Freedom!

01:18.792 --> 01:20.020
NARRATOR:
...Grant lmahara...

01:20.093 --> 01:21.754
Let's go! Come on!
I'm gonna be rich!

01:21.828 --> 01:24.023
NARRATOR:
...and Kari Byron.

01:24.097 --> 01:25.564
- [Gunshot]
- That was a rush!

01:25.632 --> 01:27.600
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.864
They put them to the test.

01:46.119 --> 01:47.882
A little old for dolls,
aren't we?

01:47.954 --> 01:50.115
[Chuckles]
This is not a doll.

01:50.190 --> 01:51.589
This is a demonstration model

01:51.658 --> 01:52.886
for the next story
we've got to do,

01:52.959 --> 01:54.756
which comes
right from the fan site.

01:54.828 --> 01:57.126
Okay, tell me more.

01:57.197 --> 01:58.789
[British accent]
I'm a skydiver, right,

01:58.865 --> 02:01.629
and I'm falling
through the air [Whooshes]

02:01.701 --> 02:04.101
And my parachute
has utterly failed.

02:04.171 --> 02:06.071
Looking desperately
down at the ground

02:06.139 --> 02:09.666
for something to break my fall,
I spy a children's playground

02:09.743 --> 02:13.406
and a seesaw with a little girl
at the other end.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.608
Not worrying about her, I aim
for this end of the seesaw,

02:16.683 --> 02:18.583
go straight upright
at the last second.

02:18.652 --> 02:21.951
I hit the seesaw and
catapult that poor little girl

02:22.022 --> 02:25.014
up to the top
of a seven-story building,

02:25.091 --> 02:28.185
where, amazingly,
she lands safely.

02:28.261 --> 02:29.455
Wow.

02:29.529 --> 02:31.463
Sounds almost too good
to be true.

02:31.531 --> 02:33.556
I thought the same thing.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.100
NARRATOR:
Lmprobable, yes.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.601
But impossible?

02:36.670 --> 02:39.138
Parachutes
do sometimes fail to open.

02:39.206 --> 02:40.138
[Gasps]

02:40.207 --> 02:42.266
If he's jumping
over a town or city,

02:42.342 --> 02:45.175
it's feasible he could drop
over a playground.

02:45.245 --> 02:47.543
Common sense and basic physics

02:47.614 --> 02:49.809
tells us
that if he hits the seesaw,

02:49.883 --> 02:53.216
that lonely little girl
is going somewhere.

02:53.286 --> 02:56.722
But seven stories high,
and she lives?

02:56.790 --> 02:59.020
Well, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

02:59.092 --> 03:00.719
[Normal voice]
"Jamie, I don't know about you,

03:00.794 --> 03:02.728
but I feel like
we could just go for this one."

03:02.796 --> 03:04.195
Sure, we can do it
right outside.

03:04.264 --> 03:06.232
All we need
is a regulation seesaw.

03:06.299 --> 03:07.789
And a correctly weighted
little girl.

03:07.868 --> 03:08.732
And a skydiver.

03:08.802 --> 03:11.202
Terrific.
Let's do it.

03:11.271 --> 03:13.967
When I was a kid,
seesaws were long wooden planks,

03:14.040 --> 03:15.564
and that's what we started
looking for.

03:15.642 --> 03:17.576
But it turns out
no one makes those anymore.

03:17.644 --> 03:19.373
Now seesaws
are made out of steel,

03:19.446 --> 03:22.973
and there are as many designs
as there seem to be playgrounds.

03:23.049 --> 03:26.075
So we have chosen
a mid-range, middle-of-the-road,

03:26.152 --> 03:29.553
simple steel seesaw, and
that's what I'm about to build.

03:30.357 --> 03:31.324
NARRATOR:
For Adam,

03:31.391 --> 03:34.155
building a two-kid plaything
is a one-man job.

03:34.227 --> 03:37.355
Inside 30 minutes,
he welds a central pivot

03:37.430 --> 03:40.763
from 2-inch pipes
and a couple of elbow joints.

03:41.968 --> 03:44.835
ADAM: The bench itself is just
a 10-foot slab of hollow steel.

03:44.905 --> 03:47.703
Now I've just got to attach
one to the other.

03:50.143 --> 03:51.405
NARRATOR:
So far, so good.

03:51.478 --> 03:55.915
But then Adam finds a fatal flaw
in the foundations.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.006
ADAM: [Chuckles]

03:57.083 --> 03:59.074
There's no kid
that wants to go that high.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.518
NARRATOR:
After a quick nip/tuck,

04:01.588 --> 04:03.556
we've got a working seesaw,

04:03.623 --> 04:07.457
a simple device that just might
flip an unsuspecting 6-year-old

04:07.527 --> 04:09.017
seven stories high.

04:09.095 --> 04:10.119
ADAM:
Much better.

04:12.732 --> 04:14.097
NARRATOR:
But here's the problem.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.964
To hit terminal velocity,

04:16.036 --> 04:21.632
the unlucky skydiver would have
to fall from at least 600 feet.

04:21.708 --> 04:22.697
ADAM: [Grunts]

04:22.776 --> 04:25.540
So to get around that problem,
at least for this first test,

04:25.612 --> 04:28.445
what I'm doing
is trading altitude for weight.

04:28.515 --> 04:30.039
When I fill these barrels
with water,

04:30.116 --> 04:31.947
they'll be much heavier
than a man,

04:32.018 --> 04:33.883
so we can then drop them
from a much lower height

04:33.954 --> 04:36.616
and get a more or less
guaranteed hit.

04:36.690 --> 04:40.091
And the impact force
should be exactly the same.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.491
NARRATOR:
That's the theory,

04:41.561 --> 04:43.927
and they can't wait
to put it into practice,

04:43.997 --> 04:46.989
so they've picked a drop zone
that's real close to home...

04:47.067 --> 04:49.865
the parking lot behind M5.

04:49.936 --> 04:52.302
And that's just getting
welded down at the plate?

04:52.372 --> 04:53.703
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:54.407 --> 04:57.308
NARRATOR: It's a stunt
that will scare the neighbors.

04:57.377 --> 04:59.607
Given the massive forces
at play,

04:59.679 --> 05:01.943
only a lunatic
would choose this moment

05:02.015 --> 05:04.483
to trial a new technology.

05:04.551 --> 05:07.019
This quick release,
which holds up to 10,000 pounds,

05:07.087 --> 05:08.281
is gonna be the mechanism

05:08.355 --> 05:10.585
by which we drop our weight
on the seesaw.

05:10.657 --> 05:13.990
And normally we'd use it
in a "pull on a wire" mode.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.460
Now it's got
an automatic cylinder release,

05:16.529 --> 05:19.362
which, when we connect a battery
from our viewing site,

05:19.432 --> 05:21.923
and I say,
"Connect the battery"...

05:22.002 --> 05:23.094
[Clang]

05:23.169 --> 05:25.865
...it's gonna drop the weight
right on our seesaw.

05:25.939 --> 05:27.668
NARRATOR:
Now for the checklist.

05:27.741 --> 05:29.675
They've got the crane.

05:29.743 --> 05:31.210
They've got the weight.

05:31.277 --> 05:35.907
And Adam's built a teeter-totter
that both sees and saws.

05:35.982 --> 05:38.507
JAMIE: Okay, so it is,
in fact, a seesaw.

05:39.352 --> 05:41.047
It is, in fact, a seesaw.

05:41.121 --> 05:42.383
I want one of these
in my office.

05:42.455 --> 05:44.355
[Laughs]

05:44.424 --> 05:47.257
NARRATOR: All we need now
is a full-scale victim,

05:47.327 --> 05:50.125
and this one is almost too cute
to catapult.

05:50.196 --> 05:51.629
Almost.

05:51.698 --> 05:54.166
JAMIE:
So, shall we name her "Ariel"?

05:54.234 --> 05:55.667
NARRATOR:
Nice call, Jamie,

05:55.735 --> 05:59.501
but it's best not to get
too attached to your missiles.

05:59.572 --> 06:00.937
JAMIE:
Our little girl over here

06:01.007 --> 06:02.770
is supposed to be
an average 6-year-old,

06:02.842 --> 06:05.436
and so we've made her weight
50 pounds.

06:05.512 --> 06:07.946
Now, if the physics
in this story are correct,

06:08.014 --> 06:10.608
the water barrels, when they hit
this end of the seesaw,

06:10.684 --> 06:16.122
are gonna launch her straight up
about 70 feet, or 7 stories.

06:16.756 --> 06:18.724
ADAM: I've calculated
that filling the barrels

06:18.792 --> 06:20.657
with 1, 150 pounds of water

06:20.727 --> 06:24.185
and then dropping them from
75 feet should exactly match

06:24.264 --> 06:29.463
the skydiver's free-fall impact
force of 85,000 foot-pounds.

06:29.536 --> 06:30.525
NARRATOR:
The foot-pound

06:30.603 --> 06:32.366
is a standard
gravitational measurement.

06:32.439 --> 06:35.465
It's the energy expended
by a force of one pound

06:35.542 --> 06:38.636
acting through a distance
of one foot.

06:38.712 --> 06:40.270
- JAMIE: Looks good to me.
- ADAM: All right.

06:40.346 --> 06:41.540
Let's go up.

06:42.182 --> 06:43.945
NARRATOR:
The numbers look good on paper,

06:44.017 --> 06:47.919
but let's see how it all
pans out on the pavement.

06:47.987 --> 06:50.012
So, I'm gonna pull the safety,
but you know what?

06:50.090 --> 06:51.955
I don't want to be anywhere
on this lot

06:52.025 --> 06:53.322
when we drop this thing.

06:53.393 --> 06:55.293
I was thinking
we should be up over there.

06:55.361 --> 06:57.386
I was thinking the same thing.

06:57.964 --> 06:59.295
NARRATOR:
So with the elements in place,

06:59.365 --> 07:02.061
Adam and Jamie head
for the high ground.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.805
ADAM: Right now
I'd describe the situation

07:05.872 --> 07:07.999
as "mayhem in potentia."

07:08.074 --> 07:11.009
Soon we'll have actual mayhem.

07:11.077 --> 07:15.514
NARRATOR: And that actual mayhem
is now just moments away.

07:15.582 --> 07:17.948
All right, here we go...
skydiver seesaw.

07:18.017 --> 07:21.885
In 3, 2, 1.

07:28.161 --> 07:30.789
[Laughing]

07:34.901 --> 07:37.096
Aw, darn.
The seesaw broke.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.638
It just kind of like
folded in half.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.401
NARRATOR:
The bench is buckled,

07:41.474 --> 07:43.635
but the full extent
of this disaster

07:43.710 --> 07:46.702
is best assessed
from ground level.

07:50.283 --> 07:56.017
I don't think we've ever done
this specific kind of damage.

07:56.089 --> 07:58.057
What do you mean?
A little bending and welding.

07:58.124 --> 08:00.319
- And it will be good as new.
- [Laughs]

08:00.393 --> 08:01.860
Look, you can see where...

08:01.928 --> 08:04.761
That's exactly where it hit
the rebar handle.

08:04.831 --> 08:08.995
Yeah. Which is, like, flattened
as flat as it could be.

08:09.569 --> 08:12.402
It not only crushed it
right at the pivot point,

08:12.472 --> 08:14.804
but it also crushed it
right at the end here.

08:14.874 --> 08:18.503
So, you know,
that's a heck of a lot of force.

08:18.578 --> 08:19.977
A lot more than we considered.

08:20.046 --> 08:21.377
We're gonna have to rethink
this thing.

08:21.447 --> 08:23.813
Yeah. Even if this was
a solid bar of steel,

08:23.883 --> 08:25.043
I don't think
it would have taken it.

08:25.118 --> 08:25.777
ADAM: Yeah.

08:29.055 --> 08:30.989
I swear, this is the best part
of the job...

08:31.057 --> 08:32.888
reviewing
the high-speed footage.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.222
I want to see if she even
comes off the ground.

08:35.294 --> 08:36.386
Oh, I think she does.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.123
I saw her flip
a couple of times.

08:38.198 --> 08:42.328
NARRATOR: Little Ariel launched
at exactly 23 miles per hour

08:42.402 --> 08:44.563
and then flew 20 feet high.

08:44.637 --> 08:46.264
ADAM:
What goes up...

08:46.339 --> 08:47.397
- Come back!
- Must come down.

08:47.473 --> 08:48.701
Here it is.

08:48.775 --> 08:50.572
NARRATOR:
That's barely two stories,

08:50.643 --> 08:53.043
way short of the mythical seven.

08:53.112 --> 08:54.977
[Both laugh]

08:58.585 --> 09:02.282
But with all the substitutions,
this test was always more likely

09:02.355 --> 09:05.415
to be an indication
than an indictment.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.051
I can't help but feel
this nagging feeling in my head

09:10.129 --> 09:11.596
that there's a big difference

09:11.664 --> 09:14.599
between 1,000 pounds of water
in steel cans

09:14.667 --> 09:18.967
and a soft,
100-and-some-odd-pound skydiver

09:19.038 --> 09:21.529
falling at terminal velocity.

09:22.675 --> 09:26.076
We've got a lot of rethinking
to do to really call this one.

09:26.145 --> 09:28.773
This thing right here...
It already buckled.

09:28.848 --> 09:31.544
And so, all of that energy
has been wasted.

09:31.618 --> 09:34.382
Now we need to figure out,
if we're gonna make this work,

09:34.454 --> 09:38.015
how to get all of that energy
over there

09:38.091 --> 09:40.025
to come over here
to the little girl

09:40.093 --> 09:44.086
without wasting itself on
breaking things in the process.

09:44.163 --> 09:47.326
NARRATOR: In short, the fact
that a home-built seesaw

09:47.400 --> 09:50.267
cracked under the weight
of three sharp-edged barrels

09:50.336 --> 09:53.635
doesn't prove or disprove
the myth.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.036
And with the help
of Tory, Grant, and Kari,

09:57.110 --> 09:59.544
things will get better.

10:04.484 --> 10:06.577
The common playground seesaw

10:06.653 --> 10:09.986
is about as safe or as dangerous
as you want to make it.

10:12.825 --> 10:14.656
But could it really toss a girl

10:14.727 --> 10:16.752
on top
of a seven-story building?

10:16.829 --> 10:19.457
Well, it flipped an elephant,
right?

10:19.532 --> 10:22.057
[Trumpets]

10:22.135 --> 10:24.729
Dude, there is a lot to do
in this myth.

10:24.804 --> 10:26.999
Yeah, there is,
but I'm ahead of you.

10:27.073 --> 10:30.565
Reinforcements
should be arriving... now.

10:30.643 --> 10:33.134
- KARI: What do you need?
- [Laughing] Okay.

10:33.212 --> 10:35.112
You know the seesaw myth
that we're working on?

10:35.181 --> 10:37.649
- Yeah.
- We need a way, first,

10:37.717 --> 10:40.686
to calculate the terminal
velocity of our skydivers.

10:40.753 --> 10:42.186
Specifically in the myth,
it stated

10:42.255 --> 10:43.984
that he is wearing
a camera suit.

10:44.057 --> 10:45.547
That's a specific kind
of skydiving suit.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.217
We need to know
how fast he's going.

10:47.293 --> 10:48.885
Okay, cool.
What else?

10:48.962 --> 10:51.328
Well, we need to have a delivery
system for the skydiver

10:51.397 --> 10:53.888
to put him on target
at terminal velocity.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.902
A giant crane?
We'll figure it out.

10:56.970 --> 10:59.029
All right.
We'll see you later.

10:59.939 --> 11:01.201
- "We'll figure it out."
- I don't know.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.468
I just went blank.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.942
Great.
Always have to be the hero.

11:05.011 --> 11:07.138
NARRATOR: So on
the very next misty morning,

11:07.213 --> 11:09.943
the team arrives
at SkyDance SkyDiving

11:10.016 --> 11:14.419
to see just how slowly a man
can fall in a camera suit.

11:14.921 --> 11:18.550
Grant's our designated diver,
and Nick Armstrong's here

11:18.624 --> 11:21.115
to point him
in the right direction... down.

11:21.194 --> 11:23.458
- So, this is the camera suit?
- Yes, it is.

11:23.529 --> 11:24.791
Can you tell us
a little bit about it?

11:24.864 --> 11:25.888
Sure.

11:25.965 --> 11:28.934
It's different
from most of our skydiving suits

11:29.002 --> 11:31.971
in that it's built specifically
for videographers.

11:32.538 --> 11:33.937
NARRATOR:
The key design difference

11:34.007 --> 11:36.771
is a wing-like flap
from the elbows to the hips

11:36.843 --> 11:39.277
that should give
added air resistance.

11:39.345 --> 11:41.905
So you can get a lot slower
with one of these suits on?

11:41.981 --> 11:43.448
Absolutely.

11:43.516 --> 11:46.007
NARRATOR:
Grant's not licensed to go solo,

11:46.085 --> 11:48.383
so he's doing a tandem jump.

11:49.555 --> 11:51.318
Nick's wearing the camera suit

11:51.391 --> 11:54.224
and a fancy
Altitracker wrist computer

11:54.293 --> 11:56.989
to log the details
of his descent.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.356
He and Grant
are both gonna go up.

11:59.432 --> 12:01.229
They're both gonna jump
at the same time.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.824
And when Grant gives Nick
the signal,

12:02.902 --> 12:05.063
he's gonna spread out
as far as possible

12:05.138 --> 12:07.504
to see if he can slow down
his descent.

12:07.573 --> 12:09.973
And when he gets off the plane,
I'm going to take that,

12:10.043 --> 12:11.135
download it into a computer.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.201
We'll have a graph
that'll tell us all the speeds.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.180
TORY: Now, after Nick is done
with the spread-eagle position,

12:16.249 --> 12:18.513
then he's gonna try
flapping his wings.

12:18.584 --> 12:21.382
Is flapping your wings
gonna make you slow down more?

12:21.454 --> 12:22.386
I don't know.

12:22.455 --> 12:24.047
Maybe it'll take your mind
off the fact

12:24.123 --> 12:26.421
that you're falling
without a parachute.

12:31.697 --> 12:33.221
NARRATOR:
For a veteran skydiver,

12:33.299 --> 12:36.564
flapping your wings
sounds a touch undignified,

12:36.636 --> 12:38.001
but it's worth a shot.

12:38.071 --> 12:41.302
Grant's just happy be here.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.433
GRANT: This is one
of those great opportunities

12:43.509 --> 12:47.605
on this show to do something
that's reasonably dangerous,

12:47.680 --> 12:49.204
but in relative safety.

12:49.282 --> 12:52.080
I'm very excited to try this
out again.

12:52.151 --> 12:55.382
This will be my second sky-dive.
Hope things go great.

12:57.557 --> 12:59.047
NARRATOR:
So do we, buddy.

12:59.125 --> 13:03.528
When the plane hits 2 miles
high, the passengers push off.

13:10.603 --> 13:12.969
GRANT:
[Shouting in distance]

13:13.539 --> 13:15.268
NARRATOR:
Once the guys get situated,

13:15.341 --> 13:17.502
Nick initiates
part one of the test...

13:17.577 --> 13:20.512
spreading those tiny wings.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.707
The result
is just as predicted...

13:22.782 --> 13:27.151
Relative to Grant, he does seem
to reduce his speed.

13:27.220 --> 13:31.350
A few seconds later, Nick tries
flapping like a giant pelican

13:31.424 --> 13:33.892
to see if that slows him down.

13:37.563 --> 13:38.086
GRANT: Yep.

13:38.164 --> 13:41.565
NARRATOR: Team lmahara makes
a perfect 4-point landing.

13:42.135 --> 13:44.000
- ARMSTRONG: [Laughs]
- NICK: Nicely done.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.664
- You're safe and sound.
- You made it.

13:46.739 --> 13:48.570
NARRATOR:
And our eye in the sky

13:48.641 --> 13:51.906
has a fair idea of what worked
and what didn't.

13:51.978 --> 13:56.278
So, he opened up his arms,
and he was gone, just like that.

13:56.349 --> 13:59.546
So when he reset and tried to
start flapping, how did that go?

13:59.619 --> 14:01.382
GRANT:
Yeah, I saw him come back down

14:01.454 --> 14:02.921
when he started flapping
his arms,

14:02.989 --> 14:05.116
and he was just falling
at the same speed I was.

14:05.691 --> 14:07.318
NARRATOR:
To confirm Grant's account,

14:07.393 --> 14:09.953
Kari downloads the data
from Nick's wrist computer,

14:10.029 --> 14:13.089
and the graph
couldn't be more clear.

14:13.599 --> 14:16.261
When Nick opened up
his camera suit

14:16.335 --> 14:19.133
and went completely spread out
so he had the most surface area,

14:19.205 --> 14:22.641
he slowed down
to about 114 miles an hour.

14:22.708 --> 14:25.643
But over here, this is where
he started flapping his wings

14:25.711 --> 14:27.576
like a cartoon
to see if he could slow down,

14:27.647 --> 14:29.808
you know, Goofy-style.

14:29.882 --> 14:31.645
That didn't seem to work
too well.

14:31.717 --> 14:35.710
NARRATOR: So 114 miles per hour
looks like the speed to aim for.

14:35.788 --> 14:38.916
But Grant's remembered
a crucial part of the story

14:38.991 --> 14:42.859
they've overlooked,
so Tory needs to suit up.

14:43.462 --> 14:44.929
GRANT:
We need to send Nick up again

14:44.997 --> 14:46.760
because the myth
specifically said

14:46.832 --> 14:49.392
the skydiver tried to land
on his feet.

14:49.468 --> 14:50.400
In other words,

14:50.469 --> 14:52.562
he fell spread-eagled
like the last test,

14:52.638 --> 14:55.869
but then at the last second,
tried to land the jump,

14:55.942 --> 14:57.569
and I'm guessing
that even if the guy

14:57.643 --> 15:00.009
only went perpendicular
for a second or two,

15:00.079 --> 15:02.047
it could significantly change
the speed

15:02.114 --> 15:03.911
at which he hit the seesaw.

15:05.418 --> 15:07.079
TORY:
All right, here we are again,

15:07.153 --> 15:08.677
putting our lives on the line
for science.

15:08.754 --> 15:10.153
But don't get me wrong.
I love skydiving.

15:10.223 --> 15:13.818
But I've only been two times,
so maybe that's natural.

15:13.893 --> 15:16.054
Ready, set...

15:18.531 --> 15:20.965
NARRATOR: They all assume
the standard frog position.

15:21.033 --> 15:25.697
It takes 10 full seconds and
at least 600 feet of free fall

15:25.771 --> 15:28.035
to reach terminal velocity.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.678
Then Nick tries going vertical.

15:36.382 --> 15:37.679
It's harder than it looks.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.651
A few seconds later,
he tries again.

15:41.854 --> 15:44.516
Hopefully Nick stayed upright
long enough

15:44.590 --> 15:48.617
for the computer to register
any change in velocity.

15:49.195 --> 15:52.926
And if Grant was right, that
brief moment of verticality

15:52.999 --> 15:55.934
will affect the speed at impact.

15:57.303 --> 15:59.999
Then at the last second,
he tries to land on his feet.

16:00.072 --> 16:02.336
He kind of closes up
into a smaller position,

16:02.408 --> 16:04.205
and his speed shoots up
a little bit.

16:04.277 --> 16:07.713
But since it's only 1 second, he
gets to about 122 miles an hour.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.680
Now, that is the important
number right there

16:09.749 --> 16:11.182
because that's gonna be
the final speed

16:11.250 --> 16:13.775
at which he hits the seesaw.

16:19.558 --> 16:22.721
NARRATOR: For just the second
time in Mythbusters history,

16:22.795 --> 16:24.695
the whole team
has pulled together

16:24.764 --> 16:29.531
to test one fantastic fable...
the skydiver who hit a seesaw

16:29.602 --> 16:32.628
and sent a little girl
seven stories high.

16:32.705 --> 16:35.230
If that's not too hard
to swallow,

16:35.308 --> 16:37.640
the myth says she survived
the adventure.

16:37.710 --> 16:41.441
But that car-park catastrophe
still haunts Adam.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.975
It's not looking good
for this myth, man.

16:46.052 --> 16:49.510
I mean, if our regulation seesaw
made of steel

16:49.588 --> 16:51.249
can't come close
to handling the forces,

16:51.324 --> 16:54.020
can't transfer the energy from
the skydiver to the little girl,

16:54.093 --> 16:57.620
then this thing's busted
before we've seen anything fly.

16:57.697 --> 17:00.564
Yeah, the forces involved
are really enormous,

17:00.633 --> 17:04.433
but there's nothing stopping us
from improving on that design,

17:04.502 --> 17:06.561
making one
that's indestructible...

17:06.638 --> 17:07.935
a super seesaw.

17:08.007 --> 17:10.373
We can build
the mother of all seesaws.

17:10.443 --> 17:11.375
I love it.

17:11.444 --> 17:14.310
And then if it holds together,
the girl might just fly.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.972
She might.

17:16.048 --> 17:19.244
NARRATOR:
And Jamie has some grand plans.

17:19.318 --> 17:21.912
It may not be
the best seesaw ever...

17:21.987 --> 17:24.387
who knows
what NASA has locked away?..

17:24.457 --> 17:26.185
But he's aiming high.

17:26.258 --> 17:29.955
We want to exactly be done
with delivering the load

17:30.029 --> 17:34.193
from the incoming projectile
right before it hits the ground.

17:34.266 --> 17:36.928
NARRATOR: But why scribble
when you've got the software

17:37.002 --> 17:40.438
to design and test the concept?

17:41.073 --> 17:42.836
JAMIE: We're using
SolidWorks software here,

17:42.908 --> 17:44.205
which I've had for a while,

17:44.276 --> 17:46.938
but I've never really been able
to use it to its full potential.

17:47.513 --> 17:48.741
The beauty
of something like this

17:48.814 --> 17:50.406
is that it really allows me

17:50.483 --> 17:53.680
to push the limits
of the material and the design

17:53.753 --> 17:55.584
because it doesn't matter
if the design

17:55.654 --> 17:56.586
breaks on the computer.

17:56.655 --> 17:57.952
I'll just pull up another one

17:58.023 --> 17:59.888
and change it a little bit
and try again.

17:59.959 --> 18:02.052
And that way,
by the time I get around

18:02.128 --> 18:05.529
to building the real thing,
I already know it's gonna work.

18:05.598 --> 18:09.090
NARRATOR: Jamie's decided to
build his bench in two parts,

18:09.168 --> 18:10.931
both hinged on a pivot.

18:11.003 --> 18:14.097
Where does that put us
as far as our yield strength?

18:14.173 --> 18:15.504
NARRATOR:
The big picture here

18:15.574 --> 18:17.701
is to maximize
the energy transfer

18:17.777 --> 18:22.441
from the falling man to the girl
and to keep the seesaw intact.

18:22.515 --> 18:25.177
So I started thinking about,
"What do I know

18:25.251 --> 18:28.550
that is really massively strong
and lightweight?"

18:28.621 --> 18:31.488
And so what I came up with
was a construction crane,

18:31.557 --> 18:32.717
like this toy here.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.727
Instead of relying on something
to not bend,

18:35.795 --> 18:38.457
they put a cable
across the top of it

18:38.531 --> 18:42.023
so the load that's being
experienced is on that cable,

18:42.101 --> 18:46.367
and instead of a bending force
on this spar structure here,

18:46.439 --> 18:48.202
you've got a compressive load.

18:48.274 --> 18:51.266
It's hard to see here,
but the load is this way.

18:51.343 --> 18:53.208
And so you end up with something

18:53.279 --> 18:55.213
that's able to build
whole buildings,

18:55.281 --> 18:57.943
and yet there's really
not a whole lot there.

18:58.517 --> 18:59.984
NARRATOR:
The next few hours

19:00.052 --> 19:04.489
sees Jamie and a small team
of experts refine the design.

19:05.124 --> 19:08.924
Any kind of offset would cause
a twisting sort of a thing

19:08.994 --> 19:10.552
that it would be a problem.

19:12.164 --> 19:15.429
NARRATOR: While Jamie thinks
big, Adam goes small scale

19:15.501 --> 19:17.731
to get some idea
of what to look for

19:17.803 --> 19:19.964
when they try this again
at full force.

19:22.608 --> 19:24.838
ADAM: Building a toy
teeter-totter is easy-peasy,

19:24.910 --> 19:27.606
and, I don't know,
kind of wholesome, you know?

19:30.382 --> 19:32.907
NARRATOR: Filling
a muscleman body with lead shot

19:32.985 --> 19:35.476
is kind of strange.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.819
But capping it off
with a baby-doll head

19:38.891 --> 19:40.722
is just plain weird.

19:40.793 --> 19:43.159
Still, it should do the job.

19:43.229 --> 19:46.596
What I've got here is
a scale model of our seesaw rig.

19:46.665 --> 19:49.293
This is our little girl,
as creepy as she looks,

19:49.368 --> 19:50.892
and this is our skydiver,

19:50.970 --> 19:52.801
as much as it looks
like a round ball.

19:52.872 --> 19:55.898
They are the equivalent
weight relationship

19:55.975 --> 19:59.968
of our real skydiver and our
real girl... about 31/2 to 1.

20:00.045 --> 20:02.912
What I want to investigate
with this is,

20:02.982 --> 20:05.974
what happens to her when
the skydiver hits the seesaw?

20:06.051 --> 20:08.110
If the seesaw doesn't break,
where does she go?

20:08.187 --> 20:09.449
What is her trajectory,

20:09.522 --> 20:12.150
and what can I predict
about her trajectory?

20:13.425 --> 20:15.518
NARRATOR:
So Adam starts test number one

20:15.594 --> 20:18.119
from 10 feet up
on the scissor lift.

20:18.197 --> 20:20.927
A plumb line indicates
the perfect drop point,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.661
and it's bombs away.

20:22.735 --> 20:24.794
ADAM:
3, 2, 1.

20:24.870 --> 20:27.338
[Thud, clang]

20:27.406 --> 20:29.806
[Laughs]

20:34.647 --> 20:38.083
Oh, God, that's one of the best
high-speed shots ever.

20:38.651 --> 20:41.381
I dropped the weight
from about 10 feet up.

20:41.453 --> 20:44.286
She smacked into that lamp
at a pretty high speed,

20:44.356 --> 20:47.325
which means she's going higher
in the air

20:47.393 --> 20:49.725
than the lead weight
is starting from.

20:49.795 --> 20:52.923
That tells me there might really
be something to this.

20:53.499 --> 20:55.433
NARRATOR:
So Adam installs a scale

20:55.501 --> 20:58.629
that measures the drop height
at 6-inch intervals.

20:59.505 --> 21:00.335
30 inches.

21:00.406 --> 21:02.636
NARRATOR: He starts out
from just 30 inches.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.575
3, 2, 1.

21:07.079 --> 21:08.478
[Laughs]

21:08.547 --> 21:09.878
Dropping from 36 inches.

21:09.949 --> 21:10.881
For such a simple test,

21:10.950 --> 21:15.284
this one is giving me
tons of data... and good data.

21:15.354 --> 21:16.184
42 inches.

21:16.255 --> 21:18.621
Number one, I think
she might actually make it

21:18.691 --> 21:21.216
to the roof of that seven-story
building or higher.

21:21.293 --> 21:23.318
Here we go with 48.

21:23.395 --> 21:25.522
Secondly, I'm noticing
her flight characteristics.

21:25.598 --> 21:27.930
She is pretty much staying
in line with the seesaw...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.024
Wow!

21:29.101 --> 21:31.535
...either landing
where she took off from

21:31.604 --> 21:33.196
or landing around the center
of the seesaw.

21:33.272 --> 21:36.435
That gives me a really good bead
on where we can all safely be

21:36.508 --> 21:39.170
when we're watching this thing
happen in full scale.

21:40.346 --> 21:42.337
Dropped from a height
of 36 inches...

21:42.414 --> 21:43.346
NARRATOR:
When he's done,

21:43.415 --> 21:46.179
Adam checks the replays
to log the stats.

21:46.251 --> 21:47.081
42.

21:47.653 --> 21:51.111
NARRATOR: And the big graph
confirms his optimism.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.988
Hey, dude.
Check this out, man.

21:54.059 --> 21:54.821
Higher.

21:54.893 --> 21:56.451
NARRATOR: When the dots
are joined, the line

21:56.528 --> 22:00.089
shows a compound increase
that's hard to ignore.

22:00.165 --> 22:02.759
When I dropped the weight
from 54 inches,

22:02.835 --> 22:05.827
she flew 8 feet into the air.

22:06.839 --> 22:07.965
Wow.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.133
I'm looking at this, I think
she might actually make it

22:10.209 --> 22:11.904
to the top
of this seven-story building.

22:12.478 --> 22:15.447
NARRATOR: But a full-scale girl
won't hit those dizzy heights

22:15.514 --> 22:18.244
without Jamie's super seesaw.

22:20.853 --> 22:24.289
They've got the parts, and now
they have to put it together.

22:24.923 --> 22:29.292
ADAM: Obviously, we like the
complex engineering challenges.

22:29.862 --> 22:31.693
"Lead Balloon."

22:31.764 --> 22:33.664
[Laughing]

22:35.134 --> 22:36.601
"Shredded Plane."

22:36.669 --> 22:37.567
Yeah!

22:37.636 --> 22:40.161
"Ping-Pong Rescue."

22:40.239 --> 22:41.672
Yeah, it worked!

22:41.740 --> 22:42.707
Whoo!

22:42.775 --> 22:44.299
This is the first time
we've ever resorted

22:44.376 --> 22:46.139
to computer simulations

22:46.211 --> 22:48.702
for calculating the huge amounts
of energy we're dealing with.

22:48.781 --> 22:50.942
When that skydiver
hits our seesaw,

22:51.016 --> 22:53.678
it has to transfer
all of its energy...

22:53.752 --> 22:56.482
all of his energy...
to the girl.

22:56.555 --> 22:59.080
And everything
that we've done thus far

22:59.158 --> 23:01.888
says that this will do that.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.086
[Laughs]

23:03.162 --> 23:04.925
I'll believe it when I see it.

23:04.997 --> 23:07.761
This is one of two trusses
that will make the seesaw,

23:07.833 --> 23:11.428
and even without welds on it,
it's really strong.

23:12.071 --> 23:14.767
We're not only using
a different material.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.434
In this case,
we're using chromoly steel.

23:17.509 --> 23:21.001
We're using a different
configuration of it as well.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.743
The way these joints kind of
grab all of the other members...

23:24.817 --> 23:26.648
It's gonna be
really, really sturdy

23:26.719 --> 23:28.880
once we get it all welded.

23:29.455 --> 23:30.922
NARRATOR:
This thing that looks like

23:30.989 --> 23:35.756
a maximum-security birdhouse
is, in fact, the vital fulcrum.

23:35.828 --> 23:39.059
The trusses like this
are gonna be welded onto here,

23:39.131 --> 23:41.031
and this is
where the pivoting happens.

23:41.100 --> 23:44.228
It's got to be really strong
because there's gonna be

23:44.303 --> 23:46.430
one heck of a lot of weight
hitting it.

23:47.072 --> 23:49.802
NARRATOR: And if this
engineering marvel breaks,

23:49.875 --> 23:53.709
the girl, just like the myth,
ain't going nowhere.

23:59.017 --> 24:00.348
In just two days,

24:00.419 --> 24:03.411
belief in the myth of a skydiver
hitting a seesaw

24:03.489 --> 24:07.357
and shooting a small girl
70 feet high has waned...

24:08.894 --> 24:10.361
We're gonna have to rethink
this thing.

24:11.396 --> 24:12.363
NARRATOR:
...and waxed.

24:12.431 --> 24:13.625
Wow!

24:13.699 --> 24:16.964
NARRATOR: Jamie's super seesaw
looks promising,

24:17.035 --> 24:18.662
but now they need to find a way

24:18.737 --> 24:20.932
to accelerate
a full-weight dummy

24:21.006 --> 24:24.442
to terminal velocity
and hit the target.

24:24.510 --> 24:26.774
Okay, so now we know the speed
that Buster has to fall

24:26.845 --> 24:29.746
to hit the seesaw...
just over 120 miles an hour.

24:29.815 --> 24:30.804
Yeah, but there's a problem.

24:30.883 --> 24:33.317
We need at least 600 feet
to get to that speed.

24:33.385 --> 24:34.249
TORY:
600 feet?

24:34.319 --> 24:36.048
Do you know how hard
it's gonna be to hit a target

24:36.121 --> 24:37.986
dropping Buster from 600 feet?

24:38.056 --> 24:39.580
Yeah, so we need to figure out
a way

24:39.658 --> 24:41.319
that Buster could fall
faster than gravity

24:41.393 --> 24:44.226
at a reasonable distance like
100 feet and still hit the "X."

24:44.296 --> 24:46.161
- What about bungee?
- Bungee?

24:46.231 --> 24:47.664
Yeah, we do
like a reverse bungee

24:47.733 --> 24:49.724
where we attach Buster
to one end of the bungee,

24:49.802 --> 24:50.860
we anchor the other end,

24:50.936 --> 24:52.597
then we stretch him up
and release him.

24:52.671 --> 24:54.639
It hits the target every time.

24:54.706 --> 24:56.674
NARRATOR:
Fresh from skydiving school,

24:56.742 --> 24:58.710
Grant and Tory
head for the hills

24:58.777 --> 25:00.836
to try another extreme sport.

25:00.913 --> 25:05.111
Again, it's all in the name
of scary science.

25:05.184 --> 25:07.618
You know, we got close
on border slingshot,

25:07.686 --> 25:09.984
but we've never actually used
bungee in an experiment.

25:10.055 --> 25:11.079
Yeah, it's a good idea,

25:11.156 --> 25:14.557
but is it gonna get our skydiver
up to 122 miles an hour?

25:14.626 --> 25:17.459
Well, you know there's
only one way to find out.

25:17.529 --> 25:19.997
- We're gonna have to jump, huh?
- Yep.

25:20.065 --> 25:22.397
NARRATOR:
The method behind this madness

25:22.467 --> 25:25.959
is to see if a giant bungee cord
could work in reverse

25:26.038 --> 25:28.563
to slingshot a skydiver simulate

25:28.640 --> 25:32.406
to that magic mark
of 122 miles per hour.

25:32.477 --> 25:35.173
Now, I have never bungee-jumped
myself before.

25:35.247 --> 25:37.715
I've used it to strap things
together,

25:37.783 --> 25:41.184
but I've never actually depended
on it to keep me from dying.

25:41.253 --> 25:42.242
Uh...

25:42.821 --> 25:44.789
NARRATOR: And they're both
trusting their lives

25:44.857 --> 25:46.381
to this woman.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.449
So, what are
these wristbands for?

25:48.527 --> 25:51.496
Because, you know, sometimes the
bodies are horribly disfigured

25:51.563 --> 25:54.191
and it's to identify them.

25:54.967 --> 25:56.798
- Are you joking?
- I am joking.

25:56.869 --> 25:59.463
They're actually so that we get
you in the right weight class

25:59.538 --> 26:03.372
so that you don't get whiplash
or touch the river.

26:03.442 --> 26:06.343
NARRATOR: After the pep talk,
McKenzie spills the figures

26:06.411 --> 26:09.209
that have special relevance
to this myth.

26:09.281 --> 26:13.149
On your way down, you will be
going at 68.3 miles an hour.

26:13.218 --> 26:14.412
And then when you come back up,

26:14.486 --> 26:16.954
you'll be going
70. 1 miles an hour.

26:17.022 --> 26:19.286
You're coming up faster
than you went down.

26:19.858 --> 26:23.487
NARRATOR: It's that reverse
thrust they're looking for.

26:23.562 --> 26:25.393
One, two, you!

26:25.464 --> 26:27.932
NARRATOR: Tory's the first
to take the plunge.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.968
GRANT: Don't worry, buddy. It'll
all be over in a few minutes.

26:30.035 --> 26:32.094
I know.
That's what I'm worried about.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.398
[Groans]

26:33.472 --> 26:35.167
Remember, go big.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.470
You cannot dive too hard
or too far.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.476
- Oh, man.
- Go big.

26:39.544 --> 26:41.102
Oh, man!

26:41.179 --> 26:43.943
NARRATOR: Or here's a thought...
Just gol

26:44.983 --> 26:48.441
Aaaah!

26:48.520 --> 26:52.149
Whoa-oa-oa!

26:52.224 --> 26:55.216
NARRATOR: It sure looks like
Tory rebounded faster

26:55.294 --> 26:57.091
than he fell.

26:57.162 --> 26:59.062
At least he had fun.

27:00.299 --> 27:03.632
TORY: Everything in your mind
is saying, "Don't do it."

27:04.803 --> 27:07.738
Aaaah!

27:07.806 --> 27:10.366
And then once you get over
that fear to do it,

27:10.442 --> 27:12.069
then there's like this sensation

27:12.144 --> 27:14.237
of all your guts
going into your mouth.

27:14.313 --> 27:16.372
Aaaah!

27:16.448 --> 27:18.507
And then you hit the bottom,
and you bounce up,

27:18.583 --> 27:19.948
and you do it
a couple more times.

27:20.018 --> 27:22.145
So it's like... It continues.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.152
Aaaaaah!

27:23.221 --> 27:24.745
NARRATOR:
And while Tory's concerned

27:24.823 --> 27:26.188
with the state of his guts,

27:26.258 --> 27:30.786
Kari's about to be up to
her elbows in someone else's.

27:30.862 --> 27:33.854
This is going to be
my falling parachutist.

27:33.932 --> 27:35.092
Now, to make him,

27:35.167 --> 27:38.068
we need something that's
going to emulate the human body,

27:38.136 --> 27:43.574
which is approximately 75% water
to 25% solid materials.

27:43.642 --> 27:45.473
Now, to do that,
we're going to use an alginate.

27:45.544 --> 27:47.569
This is used for life casting,

27:47.646 --> 27:49.671
taking impressions when you go
to the dentist's office.

27:49.748 --> 27:52.546
We're going to fill this
wet suit with the wet alginate

27:52.617 --> 27:55.381
and hopefully we are going to
have the perfect analogue

27:55.454 --> 27:57.979
for the human body
to fall on our seesaw.

27:58.056 --> 28:01.924
NARRATOR: In short, he'll go
splat just like a real man.

28:01.994 --> 28:07.557
And Kari's figured the average
athletic weight at 171 pounds.

28:07.632 --> 28:09.395
KARI:
Kind of feels like guts.

28:09.468 --> 28:10.935
And, yes, I do know
what guts feel like.

28:11.003 --> 28:12.630
I've been on the show for years.

28:12.704 --> 28:14.228
I believe I'm in the butter zone

28:14.306 --> 28:15.500
for the weight
of my parachutist,

28:15.574 --> 28:17.872
but at this point,
I can't lift any more,

28:17.943 --> 28:19.001
and it's time to weigh in.

28:19.077 --> 28:21.739
I need to find out
how much weight he needs

28:21.813 --> 28:23.075
to make him perfect.

28:23.148 --> 28:24.911
So I'm going to go look around
the shop

28:24.983 --> 28:26.780
and see if anybody's stronger
than I am.

28:26.852 --> 28:29.878
NARRATOR: It's Jamie's fate
to carry the load,

28:29.955 --> 28:31.718
assuming he can lift it.

28:31.790 --> 28:34.281
KARI: Oh, geez.
[Laughs]

28:34.359 --> 28:36.827
- [Grunting]
- Aah!

28:40.832 --> 28:43.494
NARRATOR:
They finally do make the scales.

28:43.568 --> 28:46.503
Jamie's already weighed in
at 180 pounds,

28:46.571 --> 28:49.404
so they'll subtract his bulk
from the total.

28:49.474 --> 28:50.668
- So, how much?
- It's good.

28:50.742 --> 28:52.642
It looks like we only need
about another 20 pounds,

28:52.711 --> 28:55.009
and I haven't done
the feet or the hands yet,

28:55.080 --> 28:57.105
so I think we're right
in the zone for the body.

28:57.182 --> 28:59.047
Okay, so that was
only about what?

28:59.117 --> 29:00.084
150.

29:00.152 --> 29:01.517
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:01.586 --> 29:02.553
I'm getting old.

29:02.621 --> 29:04.452
[Laughs]

29:06.258 --> 29:09.989
NARRATOR: Back on the bungee
bridge, it's Grant's turn.

29:10.062 --> 29:11.461
Yeah, I selected cremation.

29:11.530 --> 29:13.259
- Good choice.
- Okay. Thanks.

29:13.899 --> 29:17.232
NARRATOR: He jumps the rail,
finds the platform,

29:17.302 --> 29:19.600
then takes a last deep breath.

29:19.671 --> 29:21.696
[Exhales deeply]

29:21.773 --> 29:23.001
For science.

29:23.075 --> 29:25.475
Aaaah!

29:25.544 --> 29:28.035
Whoa!
Oh, yeah!

29:28.113 --> 29:29.444
[Laughs]

29:29.514 --> 29:30.913
Whoo!

29:30.982 --> 29:33.678
Ah!
This is the best data ever!

29:33.752 --> 29:34.719
Whoo.

29:34.786 --> 29:36.344
NARRATOR:
Let's hope so.

29:36.421 --> 29:37.615
Both Grant and Tory

29:37.689 --> 29:40.522
are trying to feel
the pulling power of the bungee.

29:40.592 --> 29:42.719
GRANT: [Laughs]

29:42.794 --> 29:44.625
Well, I think
this is really gonna work.

29:44.696 --> 29:46.061
I could really feel the stretch

29:46.131 --> 29:47.860
and the acceleration
on the way back up.

29:47.933 --> 29:49.560
Yeah, but we're definitely gonna
have to tweak this

29:49.634 --> 29:52.694
in order to get our skydiver
to go 122 miles an hour.

29:52.771 --> 29:54.204
Casey.
How are you?

29:54.272 --> 29:56.399
NARRATOR: The man who might be
able to help them out

29:56.475 --> 29:59.501
is Casey Dale, from bungee.com.

29:59.578 --> 30:00.510
It can be done.

30:00.579 --> 30:03.412
It's... There's some math
involved as far as getting...

30:03.482 --> 30:05.279
How fast do you want him to go?

30:05.350 --> 30:08.285
We're trying to get him
up to 122 miles an hour.

30:08.353 --> 30:09.684
So you're going
to terminal velocity?

30:09.754 --> 30:11.745
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

30:11.823 --> 30:13.723
I mean,
Rubber bands are rubber bands.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.589
We can stretch
rubber band for you.

30:15.660 --> 30:18.458
NARRATOR: We'll need his best
and biggest rubber band,

30:18.530 --> 30:21.328
which Casey calls a mongo.

30:21.399 --> 30:27.827
"Mongo" means a really big cord,
New Zealand-style cord,

30:27.906 --> 30:32.206
so that it has more stretch
and rapid acceleration.

30:32.277 --> 30:35.974
TORY: Think you'll be able to
get it up to 122 miles an hour?

30:36.047 --> 30:39.676
Put enough rubber in, stretch it
hard enough, absolutely.

30:41.386 --> 30:44.480
NARRATOR: Meantime,
Kari struggles to dress her man.

30:45.991 --> 30:47.015
Ohh!

30:47.592 --> 30:50.083
NARRATOR:
Then adds some personality.

30:50.162 --> 30:52.756
Hey, there you go.
Now you have a head.

30:52.831 --> 30:54.856
The better to see me with.

30:59.404 --> 31:00.837
Put a parachute on you

31:00.906 --> 31:03.033
and drop you out of the sky
to your death.

31:03.542 --> 31:05.237
NARRATOR:
And he should hit a spot

31:05.310 --> 31:08.302
that's tailor-made
for a smooth landing.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.474
If the guy hits it
and ricochets off like this,

31:11.550 --> 31:12.778
that's not good for us.

31:12.851 --> 31:14.648
So we're helping it along

31:14.719 --> 31:16.619
by squaring off that end
a little bit...

31:16.688 --> 31:18.087
that's what this is here...

31:18.156 --> 31:20.590
as well as really heavily
reinforcing it

31:20.659 --> 31:23.127
so it can withstand that impact.

31:24.763 --> 31:26.094
NARRATOR:
With the frame finished

31:26.164 --> 31:27.791
and the parts
fitting perfectly...

31:27.866 --> 31:29.128
ADAM: [Laughs]

31:29.201 --> 31:30.998
- That's perfect.
- Awesome.

31:31.069 --> 31:35.028
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie rig
the high-strength Spectra rope.

31:35.106 --> 31:37.404
Working just like the cables
on a crane,

31:37.475 --> 31:39.443
this should give us
a compression,

31:39.511 --> 31:41.411
rather than a bending load.

31:41.479 --> 31:42.571
ADAM: [Laughing]

31:42.647 --> 31:44.979
Well, that's just
another seesaw.

31:45.050 --> 31:46.711
JAMIE:
That's what it is.

31:46.785 --> 31:50.221
NARRATOR: In theory, the rope
is even stronger than the spars,

31:50.288 --> 31:51.687
but no one knows for sure

31:51.756 --> 31:56.022
if this amazing structure
can withstand the sudden impact.

31:56.995 --> 31:58.929
And then there's Ariel.

31:58.997 --> 32:00.328
Will she survive?

32:00.398 --> 32:01.990
Will she even fly?

32:03.101 --> 32:06.696
The big questions
and a dozen little ones

32:06.771 --> 32:09.205
will all be answered tomorrow.

32:12.744 --> 32:15.645
All five Mythbusters
have joined forces

32:15.714 --> 32:19.047
to make or break
a bizarre urban legend...

32:19.117 --> 32:23.383
the young girl who supposedly
survived a seven-story flight

32:23.455 --> 32:25.218
from the end of a seesaw.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.554
No surprise then
that the test venue

32:27.626 --> 32:31.528
is a spectacle in itself...
Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

32:31.596 --> 32:34.030
Now, the myth states that once
the skydiver hit the seesaw,

32:34.099 --> 32:36.863
the little girl flew 70 feet up,
7 stories,

32:36.935 --> 32:38.664
and landed safely
on top of a building.

32:38.737 --> 32:41.205
Now, this works out perfectly
for us, this location,

32:41.273 --> 32:43.241
because the dry dock
is 30 feet deep

32:43.308 --> 32:45.674
and that scaffolding
right there is 40 feet tall.

32:45.744 --> 32:48.076
So when we place it
on the side of the dry dock,

32:48.146 --> 32:50.137
that is
our seven-story building.

32:50.215 --> 32:52.115
It's our point of reference.

32:52.684 --> 32:55.380
NARRATOR: Adam, Tory, and Grant
have arrived a day early

32:55.453 --> 32:58.479
to make things right
for the big test.

33:05.163 --> 33:08.064
So, you might be wondering
what these giant plates are.

33:08.133 --> 33:10.658
Well, we can't weld
to the dry dock.

33:10.735 --> 33:12.202
We can't drill into it.

33:12.270 --> 33:15.535
We basically can't modify
the dry dock in any way.

33:15.607 --> 33:18.474
But we still need
something solid

33:18.543 --> 33:22.274
to attach our bungee cord to
and to attach the seesaw to.

33:22.347 --> 33:24.611
So, our solution...
trench plates.

33:24.683 --> 33:27.550
Each one of these
weighs 7,500 pounds,

33:27.619 --> 33:31.487
and we have 2 of them
for a total of 15,000 pounds.

33:31.556 --> 33:34.389
I think that ought to be
solid enough.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.323
NARRATOR: While Tory
welds the plates together...

33:39.331 --> 33:41.822
...Adam nervously considers
his next step.

33:43.134 --> 33:44.931
ADAM: I want to make sure
that my skydiver

33:45.003 --> 33:47.301
hits this seesaw square on.

33:47.372 --> 33:49.272
So I'm gonna run two guide wires

33:49.341 --> 33:51.104
that will guide him
all the way down

33:51.176 --> 33:52.905
to hit the seesaw precisely.

33:52.977 --> 33:56.310
I've got to weld in
their bottom points.

33:56.381 --> 33:59.145
Then I got to walk out
to the end of the crane

33:59.217 --> 34:00.206
and rig the spreader bar.

34:00.285 --> 34:01.513
That should be fun.

34:02.354 --> 34:05.915
NARRATOR: It's understood that
Adam has a strange idea of fun.

34:07.158 --> 34:08.887
The job itself
is simple enough...

34:08.960 --> 34:11.793
to secure a sling
over the very end of the boom.

34:13.665 --> 34:15.860
Well, that's it.
We're fully rigged up here.

34:15.934 --> 34:17.663
I'm gonna go down below.

34:18.670 --> 34:20.603
- [Beeping]
- NARRATOR: Grant goes up

34:20.672 --> 34:23.038
to attach the spreader bar
to the sling.

34:23.108 --> 34:24.040
Getting this right

34:24.109 --> 34:27.340
is probably the most crucial
part of the setup.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.938
Okeydoke,
I'm gonna let it go.

34:32.516 --> 34:34.074
It looks good.

34:36.888 --> 34:40.516
NARRATOR: Down in the dock,
Tory welds two sturdy steel tabs

34:40.592 --> 34:42.456
to the trench plates.

34:43.228 --> 34:45.286
Adam fastens the wires,

34:45.362 --> 34:48.730
then fantasizes
about being the fall guy.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.893
So, right now I want you
to picture me

34:50.969 --> 34:52.527
as an experimental skydiver.

34:52.603 --> 34:55.197
I'm a wet suit
filled with dental alginate,

34:55.273 --> 34:57.639
and I am being
reverse-slingshotted

34:57.709 --> 35:00.576
into the ground, using
these guide wires to guide me,

35:00.645 --> 35:03.136
falling all the way into...
bang... our seesaw

35:03.214 --> 35:06.274
and hopefully sending
our little girl flying.

35:06.351 --> 35:08.182
- CASEY: [Laughs]
- TORY: Casey, you made it.

35:08.253 --> 35:09.720
NARRATOR:
With impeccable timing,

35:09.788 --> 35:13.053
Casey arrives
with a bagful of bungee.

35:13.124 --> 35:14.921
- TORY: Whoa!
- GRANT: Whoa!

35:14.993 --> 35:16.290
TORY:
Look at the size of it!

35:16.361 --> 35:18.693
GRANT: Oh, my God.
That's crazy.

35:18.763 --> 35:20.424
TORY: So, this is
our mongo bungee cord.

35:20.498 --> 35:22.022
It's 23 feet long

35:22.100 --> 35:24.398
and five times thicker
than a normal bungee cord.

35:24.469 --> 35:26.767
Now, it should be able to
stretch up to eight times

35:26.838 --> 35:27.964
its own length before it breaks.

35:28.039 --> 35:29.199
But we probably only need it

35:29.274 --> 35:30.707
to stretch at three times
its own length

35:30.775 --> 35:35.235
to get our skydiver
falling at 122 miles an hour.

35:35.313 --> 35:36.746
NARRATOR:
They've done their sums

35:36.815 --> 35:40.080
and found that 1,240 pounds
of stretch

35:40.151 --> 35:42.016
should deliver the speed
they need.

35:42.086 --> 35:44.748
But they still have to test it.

35:44.823 --> 35:47.951
So, the first thing that goes
on the big hook is this.

35:48.026 --> 35:49.994
It's a dynamometer,
and this tells us

35:50.061 --> 35:52.723
exactly how much force there is
in the system.

35:53.832 --> 35:56.801
NARRATOR: The dynamometer gets
hooked up to the quick release.

35:56.868 --> 35:59.166
Now all we need is a body.

35:59.237 --> 36:02.638
But they're not prepared to risk
Kari's alginate man

36:02.707 --> 36:03.674
on a dry run.

36:03.741 --> 36:06.574
So, for our calibration test,
we're gonna use this,

36:06.644 --> 36:09.477
which is an inner tube
filled with sand.

36:09.547 --> 36:13.415
And the idea is
that it weighs 171 pounds,

36:13.485 --> 36:16.921
which is exactly the same
as our human analogue will be.

36:16.988 --> 36:21.152
We have 171 pounds
of tire and sand

36:21.226 --> 36:24.354
hurling towards the earth
at 122 miles an hour.

36:24.429 --> 36:27.227
I am not really sure
what is gonna happen,

36:27.298 --> 36:29.323
but I know
it's gonna be violent.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.799
NARRATOR:
It will.

36:30.869 --> 36:33.633
They'll be dealing
with huge forces from the bungee

36:33.705 --> 36:37.038
as they try to propel the weight
smoothly down the guide wire

36:37.108 --> 36:40.009
for a direct hit
at terminal velocity.

36:40.078 --> 36:41.204
TORY:
You know you have a good myth

36:41.279 --> 36:43.509
when you're excited
about the calibration tests.

36:43.581 --> 36:45.276
NARRATOR:
Even in testing,

36:45.350 --> 36:48.148
this is the myth
that keeps on giving.

36:48.219 --> 36:50.187
All right,
we're at 2,240 pounds of force.

36:50.255 --> 36:52.723
- We're ready to test this.
- Okay.

36:52.790 --> 36:55.588
This is calibration test
number one.

36:55.660 --> 36:57.025
Here we go.

36:57.095 --> 37:01.259
3, 2, 1.

37:02.667 --> 37:04.294
[Laughs]

37:05.503 --> 37:06.993
Oh, my God!

37:07.071 --> 37:08.902
- Did you see what happened?
- Yeah!

37:08.973 --> 37:11.032
We just ripped the inner tube!

37:11.109 --> 37:13.077
- Yeah!
- Oh, crazy.

37:13.144 --> 37:14.702
It kind of worked.

37:14.779 --> 37:16.542
I mean, if this
had stayed together,

37:16.614 --> 37:17.603
it would have been perfect.

37:17.682 --> 37:19.206
Yeah.
The bungee cord worked.

37:20.818 --> 37:22.683
Our guide wires worked.

37:23.254 --> 37:26.052
GRANT: The inner tube is gonna
need a little bit of revision.

37:26.124 --> 37:27.819
TORY: Yeah, 'cause
this is not an accurate test.

37:27.892 --> 37:30.417
This isn't 171 pounds.

37:30.495 --> 37:33.623
What happened was, the inner
tube that we had the sand in

37:33.698 --> 37:37.532
ruptured immediately, which
shows you the kind of forces

37:37.602 --> 37:40.594
that we're using to accelerate
the skydiver.

37:44.475 --> 37:48.809
NARRATOR: The best possible
solution is simple and cheap.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.177
TORY:
I think what we're gonna do

37:50.248 --> 37:53.149
is take a duffel bag,
wrap it with ties,

37:53.217 --> 37:55.981
and hopefully that will keep
the weight together

37:56.054 --> 37:57.578
so we can get an accurate test.

37:57.655 --> 37:59.088
[Grunting]

37:59.157 --> 38:00.590
So, slight change of plan.

38:00.658 --> 38:03.388
Instead of an inner tube,
we're sending our luggage.

38:03.461 --> 38:05.361
Pull on the safety.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.261
NARRATOR:
If the bag holds together,

38:07.332 --> 38:11.063
they'll get a precise fix on the
speed of the falling skydiver,

38:11.135 --> 38:15.902
and they're hoping that's very
close to 122 miles per hour.

38:16.774 --> 38:18.799
Calibration test number two.

38:18.876 --> 38:22.004
In 3, 2, 1!

38:23.815 --> 38:26.306
Wh-aah!

38:26.384 --> 38:28.011
I had a feeling
that was gonna happen.

38:28.086 --> 38:29.610
Gah!

38:29.687 --> 38:31.484
It just ripped
through the straps.

38:31.556 --> 38:33.114
All right.
We're gonna have to redo it.

38:33.758 --> 38:35.225
TORY:
So, we just did our second test.

38:35.293 --> 38:37.193
This time
the straps on the bag broke.

38:40.064 --> 38:41.622
So the bag
didn't even get pulled down.

38:41.699 --> 38:43.291
It just fell down.

38:45.703 --> 38:47.534
NARRATOR:
Worse still, the bungee cord

38:47.605 --> 38:51.439
took a serious hit on the
carpet-covered trench plates.

38:51.509 --> 38:54.000
- TORY: This doesn't look good.
- GRANT: Unh-unh.

38:54.078 --> 38:55.739
Hey, Casey!

38:55.813 --> 38:58.611
NARRATOR: Casey has the spare
parts to build one more cord,

38:58.683 --> 39:00.947
which they'd all like to save
for tomorrow.

39:01.019 --> 39:04.546
Still, they can't proceed
without dialing in the speed,

39:04.622 --> 39:07.591
so it's well worth
a parting shot.

39:07.659 --> 39:09.786
So, right now the bungee
is so damaged

39:09.861 --> 39:11.021
that we're just gonna take it up

39:11.095 --> 39:13.290
and the very second
that it hits the right force,

39:13.364 --> 39:14.422
I'm gonna trigger it.

39:14.499 --> 39:17.366
So there's no waiting around,
none of this... just go.

39:17.435 --> 39:18.834
21.50, you push the button.

39:18.903 --> 39:19.835
I got it.

39:19.904 --> 39:22.134
NARRATOR:
Casey helps out on the launch.

39:22.206 --> 39:25.266
And at 21.5,
Grant pushes the button.

39:25.343 --> 39:26.332
It goes.

39:26.411 --> 39:31.007
NARRATOR: This last calibration
test just has to work.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.778
- Go! Hit it.
- Okay. Here we go!

39:36.020 --> 39:38.545
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39:39.757 --> 39:40.746
TORY:
It worked!

39:40.825 --> 39:43.794
It hit the target,
and the bungee didn't break.

39:43.861 --> 39:44.953
GRANT:
That's perfect.

39:45.029 --> 39:47.259
TORY: Now we just got to see
what our speed was.

39:49.133 --> 39:51.033
NARRATOR:
To calculate the speed,

39:51.102 --> 39:53.536
they carefully check
the high-speed replay

39:53.604 --> 39:57.597
frame by frame, and
there's reason to be hopeful.

39:57.675 --> 40:00.735
The bungee held,
and the bag fell unimpeded.

40:00.812 --> 40:04.805
Grant does the math, and Tory
makes the big announcement.

40:04.882 --> 40:06.907
This bungee cord is done.
We can't use it again.

40:06.984 --> 40:09.452
We're gonna have to build a new
one when we do the final test.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.680
But the good news is,

40:10.755 --> 40:13.690
is we got a calibration for the
speed of our falling skydiver,

40:13.758 --> 40:17.125
and it's exactly
122 miles an hour.

40:17.195 --> 40:18.958
We are gold.

40:22.066 --> 40:24.125
Grant and Tory, come on down!

40:24.202 --> 40:27.399
NARRATOR: It's the last day
of testing the "Seesaw Saga,"

40:27.472 --> 40:30.270
and Jamie's ready
to show off his baby.

40:30.341 --> 40:32.104
ADAM:
3, 2, 1.

40:32.176 --> 40:33.643
Ta-da!

40:33.711 --> 40:35.941
TORY: Wow!

40:36.013 --> 40:38.743
Oh, my God.
This is better than Christmas.

40:38.816 --> 40:41.307
GRANT: I've never seen a seesaw
like this before.

40:41.385 --> 40:42.613
[Laughter]

40:42.687 --> 40:45.747
I was expecting
a giant piece of steel.

40:45.823 --> 40:48.121
This is beautiful.
It's elegant.

40:48.192 --> 40:50.353
It's gorgeous.

40:50.428 --> 40:52.362
All the boys are over there
going [Giggles]

40:52.430 --> 40:55.160
"Oh, 85,000 pounds
of foot force. Oh."

40:55.233 --> 40:56.461
[Giggles]
"It's so cool."

40:56.534 --> 40:57.967
It's adorable.

40:58.035 --> 40:59.002
When you think about it,

40:59.070 --> 41:01.061
this whole story
is just totally absurd.

41:01.139 --> 41:05.303
I mean, a skydiver that
just happens to land dead-on

41:05.376 --> 41:07.207
on the end of a seesaw.

41:07.278 --> 41:09.246
A girl is on the other side.

41:09.313 --> 41:11.247
She takes off and goes,
you know,

41:11.315 --> 41:13.442
who knows how many stories
in the air.

41:13.518 --> 41:15.782
It's all just, like, nuts.

41:15.853 --> 41:16.842
It's a fantasy.

41:16.921 --> 41:20.220
But it's what we live for,
actually on this show.

41:20.792 --> 41:22.316
NARRATOR:
Kari's Diver Dan

41:22.393 --> 41:25.191
makes a rock-star entrance
to the dry dock.

41:25.263 --> 41:28.562
That's assuming the rock star
is Keith Richards.

41:28.633 --> 41:31.864
And Jamie's found a way
to improve the energy transfer

41:31.936 --> 41:34.905
by padding the impact zone
with foam.

41:34.972 --> 41:38.533
We've got an awful lot of energy
coming along with that skydiver.

41:38.609 --> 41:41.703
And if we deliver it all at once
like a hammer blow,

41:41.779 --> 41:45.112
it's gonna put a lot more stress
on the system, on the seesaw.

41:45.183 --> 41:49.483
So what we're doing is slowing
that delivery of energy down

41:49.554 --> 41:52.682
because it's got to crush this
before it gets to the seesaw.

41:52.757 --> 41:53.917
This is kind of like
the difference

41:53.991 --> 41:57.222
between a sledgehammer
and a rubber hammer.

41:57.295 --> 41:58.922
NARRATOR:
Tory delivers the victim.

41:58.996 --> 42:00.930
TORY:
You're gonna be fine.

42:00.998 --> 42:03.728
Your dad, Buster's, done it
millions of times.

42:03.801 --> 42:06.565
NARRATOR: And Grant pulls out
the shock watches.

42:06.637 --> 42:10.596
These stick-on patches
measure the force of impact.

42:10.675 --> 42:13.405
If the red one triggers,
she's dead.

42:13.477 --> 42:16.742
If the green one triggers,
she's injured and alive,

42:16.814 --> 42:18.679
but she's not walking away.

42:18.749 --> 42:20.307
NARRATOR:
So they're finally all set

42:20.384 --> 42:21.681
to see if a plummeting man,

42:21.752 --> 42:24.277
landing perfectly
on the end of a seesaw,

42:24.355 --> 42:28.519
could really launch a 6-year-old
70 feet high.

42:28.593 --> 42:30.185
JAMIE:
There's no question in my mind

42:30.261 --> 42:33.856
that there's enough energy in
the parachutist as he comes down

42:33.931 --> 42:37.332
to throw that little girl
way, way up in the air.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.869
And there's a host of problems
that we could have.

42:39.937 --> 42:41.529
The dummy could just split apart

42:41.606 --> 42:43.836
and only deliver
part of his energy.

42:43.908 --> 42:46.172
Things could not line up
properly.

42:46.244 --> 42:47.575
The rig could break.

42:47.645 --> 42:50.113
And not to mention
she has to go up

42:50.181 --> 42:53.241
pretty much straight up
in the air for this to work.

42:53.317 --> 42:56.480
NARRATOR: Let's spare a thought
for the stunt man.

42:56.554 --> 42:59.250
I have a feeling he's gonna do
what the average man would do

42:59.323 --> 43:00.915
on impact from that height.

43:00.992 --> 43:05.122
He is going to squish into
a million little, tiny pieces.

43:05.196 --> 43:08.131
ADAM: But the myth is all about
the welfare of the girl.

43:08.199 --> 43:12.226
Could she really survive
a seven-story springboard?

43:12.303 --> 43:15.568
The best way to find out
is to push the button.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.507
"Seesaw Saga," full-size test.

43:18.576 --> 43:20.407
Grant, take it away.

43:20.478 --> 43:21.410
Here we go.

43:21.479 --> 43:25.142
In 3, 2, 1.

43:26.050 --> 43:28.177
- KARI: Whoo!
- GRANT: Whoa!

43:29.287 --> 43:31.084
- Yeah!
- [Laughter]

43:33.057 --> 43:35.890
TORY: Did you expect that?
It didn't go up.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.622
- It shot across the dry dock!
- Wow.

43:40.665 --> 43:42.030
TORY:
That was cool.

43:42.099 --> 43:44.727
The skydiver hit the seesaw.
The seesaw stayed together.

43:44.802 --> 43:47.635
And the little girl got launched
over 55 feet in the air.

43:47.705 --> 43:50.230
That's above the dry dock.

43:52.343 --> 43:54.868
[Laughter]

43:54.946 --> 43:57.176
TORY:
See, the skydiver exploded.

43:57.248 --> 43:59.045
KARI:
One word for this... splat!

43:59.116 --> 44:01.346
ADAM:
Looks like he landed butt-first.

44:01.419 --> 44:05.515
His legs missed the seesaw,
but his upper torso hit it.

44:05.589 --> 44:10.151
That's probably about 60%,
70% of his mass contacted it,

44:10.227 --> 44:13.219
and even that amount was enough
to catapult her

44:13.297 --> 44:18.360
5 stories up in the air
and 70 feet laterally.

44:19.036 --> 44:21.061
NARRATOR:
Grant checks the shock watches,

44:21.138 --> 44:23.197
and the news is grim.

44:23.274 --> 44:25.242
GRANT: Oh!

44:25.309 --> 44:27.709
Red shock watch is tripped.

44:27.778 --> 44:30.440
NARRATOR: Hardly surprising
when the doll was flung

44:30.514 --> 44:33.415
high and wide
into solid concrete.

44:33.484 --> 44:35.975
But this testing
needs more finessing.

44:36.053 --> 44:36.985
JAMIE:
At this point,

44:37.054 --> 44:40.182
it looks like our understanding
of the physics is correct.

44:40.257 --> 44:41.918
The only problem that we have

44:41.993 --> 44:45.485
is our aim of the skydiver
at the target.

44:45.563 --> 44:48.623
NARRATOR: Little more than half
the weight hit the seesaw,

44:48.699 --> 44:52.226
and with Dan's demise,
the inner tube gets a recall.

44:52.303 --> 44:54.271
Hopefully it will hold together.

44:54.338 --> 44:57.273
KARI: Now, it is the same exact
weight as the average man,

44:57.341 --> 44:59.036
but this time we're hoping
that we'll impart

44:59.110 --> 45:00.634
all of its energy
onto the seesaw

45:00.711 --> 45:02.372
and fling the girl
the seven stories

45:02.446 --> 45:03.913
that we talked about
in the myth.

45:03.981 --> 45:05.346
GRANT:
Here we go!

45:05.416 --> 45:08.874
In 3, 2, 1!

45:10.955 --> 45:13.480
Yaah!

45:13.557 --> 45:14.581
KARI: Ow!

45:14.658 --> 45:17.149
- Didn't see that one coming.
- Yeah.

45:17.228 --> 45:18.820
- Dang it!
- That looked very painful.

45:18.896 --> 45:19.828
ADAM: [Laughing]

45:19.897 --> 45:21.023
TORY: [Laughs]

45:21.098 --> 45:23.259
She got clotheslined.

45:24.869 --> 45:27.429
GRANT: We got a good deployment
of the sandbag,

45:27.505 --> 45:29.496
hit the seesaw,
the girl went up,

45:29.573 --> 45:31.871
but she got tangled
in the wires.

45:33.310 --> 45:34.709
She's traveling
on a much greater arc

45:34.779 --> 45:36.576
than I saw
in any of my scale tests,

45:36.647 --> 45:38.808
and I think that's because
our seesaw's play

45:38.883 --> 45:41.351
is much greater
than the playground seesaw.

45:45.022 --> 45:47.047
Well, you can see the red grease
going up her shoe.

45:47.124 --> 45:48.921
That's right where she actually
hit the guide wire.

45:48.993 --> 45:51.689
So we're gonna have to reset
and do this one again.

45:52.263 --> 45:54.663
ADAM: In the best
Mythbusters tradition,

45:54.732 --> 45:56.427
the fast-setting winter sun

45:56.500 --> 45:59.663
means this next attempt
is absolutely our last one.

45:59.737 --> 46:00.897
It's now or never.

46:00.971 --> 46:02.029
Let's go up.

46:02.673 --> 46:04.607
NARRATOR: They can
only cross their fingers

46:04.675 --> 46:08.634
and hope that this time,
the girl misses the guide wire.

46:08.712 --> 46:09.736
GRANT:
Here we go!

46:09.814 --> 46:12.612
3, 2, 1!

46:14.718 --> 46:17.243
[All cheering]

46:20.558 --> 46:22.321
- Oh, my God!
- Touchdown!

46:22.993 --> 46:25.461
NARRATOR:
Well, Jamie said it would work.

46:25.529 --> 46:27.156
MAN: Oh!

46:28.265 --> 46:32.361
NARRATOR: The skydiver simulate
did hit 122 miles per hour.

46:35.473 --> 46:38.169
And despite
the colossal sideways arc,

46:38.242 --> 46:43.236
little Ariel flew way higher
than anyone dared to hope.

46:44.615 --> 46:47.175
ADAM: She flies about level
with our spreader bar,

46:47.251 --> 46:49.776
and that's 130 feet.

46:49.854 --> 46:51.378
JAMIE:
That's 13 stories.

46:51.455 --> 46:54.288
And that was
with an angle like this.

46:54.358 --> 46:56.087
If we'd got her to go
straight up,

46:56.160 --> 46:57.923
she would have cleared 200,
easy.

46:58.662 --> 47:01.222
NARRATOR: This myth
sounded totally improbable

47:01.298 --> 47:02.322
from the get-go.

47:02.399 --> 47:05.334
But Jamie and Adam
kept the faith.

47:05.402 --> 47:07.427
The fact is, normally
when we're testing myths

47:07.505 --> 47:09.632
that have to do with
broad guesses about physics,

47:09.707 --> 47:12.904
they're usually grossly
overestimating what's possible,

47:12.977 --> 47:15.445
and in this case,
we've come across a myth

47:15.513 --> 47:18.505
where the physics
are grossly underestimated.

47:20.050 --> 47:22.746
JAMIE: If you had
an impossibly strong seesaw

47:22.820 --> 47:24.481
and if you had a parachutist

47:24.555 --> 47:26.955
that didn't just go splat
when he hit it,

47:27.024 --> 47:29.788
you'd be capable of launching
a little girl

47:29.860 --> 47:32.556
up at least 13 stories
in the air.

47:32.630 --> 47:34.655
NARRATOR:
So, how do we call it?

47:34.732 --> 47:37.428
Well, sad to say, it's busted.

47:37.501 --> 47:40.197
Jamie built
the best possible seesaw

47:40.271 --> 47:43.399
and almost doubled
the seven-story flight.

47:43.474 --> 47:48.070
But that little girl would be
just as dead as the skydiver.

47:48.712 --> 47:50.111
I've reviewed
the high-speed footage,

47:50.181 --> 47:51.671
and I've calculated
that the little girl

47:51.749 --> 47:53.944
was subjected to 42 G's,

47:54.018 --> 47:56.851
which means, well,
she was likely injured

47:56.921 --> 47:58.980
just from her launch
from the seesaw.

47:59.056 --> 48:02.025
And her landing...
That's a whole other thing.

48:02.092 --> 48:04.583
[All cheering]

48:07.831 --> 48:09.822
Oh, my God.
That's how far she went?

48:09.900 --> 48:11.333
Nice work.

48:11.402 --> 48:13.302
We wanted seven stories.
I think she delivered.

48:13.370 --> 48:14.530
High fives.

48:14.605 --> 48:17.165
I think our work here is done.
