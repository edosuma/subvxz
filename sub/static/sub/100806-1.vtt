[Zatanna] <i>Rebmemer...</i>

00:59.076 --> 01:00.677
<i>Remember, John.</i>

01:03.881 --> 01:05.081
Remember.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.783
[Constantine groans]

01:10.587 --> 01:11.856
Remember what?

01:13.391 --> 01:14.724
That I love you.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.896
Didn't think
that was in doubt, Zee.

01:32.809 --> 01:34.678
I just wanted to say it,

01:34.744 --> 01:37.348
- before...
- Before nothing.

01:37.415 --> 01:38.615
The League will sort this out

01:38.682 --> 01:40.885
and we'll be havin' pints
by sundown.

01:43.054 --> 01:44.922
Or whatever that is
'round here.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.103
I'm glad you joined the League.

01:59.170 --> 02:00.837
I'm here for you, luv.

02:00.905 --> 02:03.174
Just don't ask me
to wear a cape.

02:04.674 --> 02:06.810
[alarm blaring]

02:06.877 --> 02:09.612
[Batman over radio] <i>All Justice League
members, report to the hangar, now.</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:12.549
Way to cock-block, Batsy.

02:14.986 --> 02:15.853
Well...

02:16.454 --> 02:17.620
time to go.

02:30.101 --> 02:32.036
[Superman] Thank you
for responding so quickly.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.772
Some of you already know
what this is about,

02:35.839 --> 02:38.275
but I wanted to get
the new members up to speed.

02:39.477 --> 02:41.312
This is Apokolips,

02:41.379 --> 02:43.314
home world of Darkseid,

02:43.381 --> 02:44.915
a power-mad despot

02:44.982 --> 02:47.985
who has orchestrated two
attempted invasions of Earth,

02:48.052 --> 02:51.288
the first of which resulted in the
formation of the Justice League.

02:51.355 --> 02:54.158
The second one, an attack
from within our ranks

02:54.225 --> 02:57.594
by Cyborg Superman
and his cyber force.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.165
- [distorted whispering]
- [groans]

03:01.232 --> 03:02.732
Raven, what's wrong?

03:04.768 --> 03:05.970
It's nothing.

03:07.872 --> 03:09.572
This image was taken
by surveillance

03:09.639 --> 03:12.176
ten hours ago on the edge
of the solar system.

03:12.243 --> 03:14.245
Apokolips phased into
our dimension

03:14.311 --> 03:15.779
and released stealth drones,

03:15.845 --> 03:17.248
then phased out again.

03:17.314 --> 03:19.984
This can only be looked at
as a prelude to war.

03:20.051 --> 03:21.785
Darkseid aims
to conquer the Earth

03:21.852 --> 03:24.288
and crush it under his heel.

03:24.355 --> 03:25.655
Regular Churchill, he is.

03:25.722 --> 03:27.058
[shushing]

03:27.124 --> 03:29.060
Look, I know the guy's
a genocidal maniac,

03:29.126 --> 03:31.062
but are we sure those are
his immediate plans?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.797
Or something he'll try in
like a thousand years?

03:35.299 --> 03:38.802
These are images from worlds
that Darkseid has conquered.

03:39.437 --> 03:40.770
<i>Our intel shows</i>

03:40.837 --> 03:42.540
<i>that he's now sent
his elite guard</i>

03:42.605 --> 03:43.807
<i>and the Furies to act</i>

03:43.874 --> 03:45.675
as an occupying force

03:45.742 --> 03:48.179
to thwart any resistance.

03:49.246 --> 03:51.614
I want to make this
perfectly clear.

03:51.681 --> 03:53.750
We are facing
an existential threat

03:53.817 --> 03:55.286
to the planet.

03:55.352 --> 03:59.056
We can't wait for Darkseid
to make the first move.

03:59.123 --> 04:01.192
That could mean the end of us.

04:03.227 --> 04:05.062
We have to attack.

04:06.297 --> 04:07.597
It's a tough job.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.999
Aside from the big bad,

04:09.066 --> 04:11.368
this place is jam-packed
with those Parademons.

04:11.435 --> 04:13.404
The League's faced them before.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.239
We know these are
their weak spots.

04:15.306 --> 04:17.908
With our combined force,
we can cut through them.

04:17.975 --> 04:19.910
Then, I'll do what needs
to be done.

04:19.976 --> 04:21.644
[Luthor] This is madness.

04:21.711 --> 04:24.148
There's always a deal
to be made.

04:24.215 --> 04:27.218
Let's at least send
an envoy to Apokolips.

04:27.284 --> 04:28.285
[Superman] No!

04:32.456 --> 04:35.126
Darkseid created a monster
that nearly killed me.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.827
What chance
would humanity have?

04:37.895 --> 04:41.432
Our only option
is to destroy him.

04:41.499 --> 04:44.535
That means Earth could be
ground zero in a world war.

04:44.602 --> 04:46.237
Look, I know some of you

04:46.303 --> 04:49.607
don't believe the visions I had
about the Flashpoint, but...

04:49.672 --> 04:51.308
a truly global war

04:51.375 --> 04:55.012
means death and destruction
on a scale you cannot imagine.

04:55.079 --> 04:57.747
Everyone on the planet
is at risk,

04:57.814 --> 04:59.250
everyone we care about.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.153
- Flash is right.
- John.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.720
Sure, this guy
deserves killing,

05:03.786 --> 05:05.222
but you can't kick
this hornet's nest

05:05.289 --> 05:08.058
like everyone on Earth
is bulletproof.

05:08.125 --> 05:12.263
Look, I won't ask you to give
anything more than I do.

05:12.329 --> 05:14.797
But this isn't up
for discussion.

05:14.865 --> 05:16.433
We're going to stop Darkseid

05:16.500 --> 05:18.002
once and for all.

05:18.869 --> 05:20.171
Here's how we do it.

05:22.373 --> 05:23.607
The main team will attack

05:23.673 --> 05:25.910
through this entryway
on Apokolips.

05:25.976 --> 05:27.677
Members of the Titans shall
remain on Earth

05:27.744 --> 05:29.013
as a home guard.

05:31.382 --> 05:33.417
<i>With the Furies
and his elite guard off-world,</i>

05:33.484 --> 05:35.818
<i>and only Parademons
to guard him,</i>

05:35.886 --> 05:38.088
<i>Darkseid will be
vulnerable to attack.</i>

05:43.760 --> 05:46.030
Honey, please
get somewhere safe.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.566
<i>Clark, I have a job,
just like you.</i>

05:48.632 --> 05:51.902
<i>I may not be able to fight this
war, but I can report the story.</i>

05:52.536 --> 05:53.836
<i>Stop worrying.</i>

05:55.272 --> 05:56.373
[sighs]

05:56.440 --> 05:58.342
Just promise to be
as careful as you can.

05:59.210 --> 06:00.444
<i>I will.</i>

06:00.511 --> 06:02.012
<i>Now go save the world.</i>

06:03.414 --> 06:04.315
I love you.

06:05.715 --> 06:06.783
<i>I know.</i>

06:14.258 --> 06:15.893
[whooshing]

06:26.437 --> 06:27.371
Nervous?

06:28.405 --> 06:30.007
Nah.

06:30.074 --> 06:31.875
Could use a ciggie, though.

06:33.510 --> 06:36.213
Preparing Javelin
for inter-dimensional portal.

06:38.415 --> 06:39.717
I got this, Bats.

06:39.782 --> 06:40.851
Sit back and relax.

06:45.889 --> 06:46.991
Booyah.

07:00.271 --> 07:01.205
Lovely.

07:11.482 --> 07:14.817
- [rapid beeping]
- Picking up lifeform readings coming at us.

07:14.885 --> 07:17.187
But they're too big
to be Parademons.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.091
Then what the hell
are those things?

07:23.994 --> 07:25.362
[creatures growling]

07:31.168 --> 07:32.036
Bollocks.

08:40.537 --> 08:41.638
[Constantine] Bollocks.

08:43.841 --> 08:46.410
And that's the last
of the Glen Luffa.

08:47.344 --> 08:49.046
The Glens are full of whiskey,

08:49.113 --> 08:51.682
I mean, lots of whiskey.

08:51.749 --> 08:53.617
Ooh. Ah.

08:55.386 --> 08:57.254
[groans]

08:57.321 --> 09:00.157
The "H"s are gonna be a breeze
after the "G"s.

09:00.224 --> 09:03.293
Too many bloody "Glens."

09:03.994 --> 09:05.696
You hear that?

09:05.763 --> 09:08.399
Still cryin' in your beer, eh?

09:08.465 --> 09:11.001
Eat yer heart out!

09:11.068 --> 09:13.437
Hello, my old friend,
Glen Magoogan.

09:24.848 --> 09:26.116
We need him.

09:27.951 --> 09:29.353
[belches]

09:30.921 --> 09:32.022
We're doomed.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.658
[Clark] John Constantine.

09:37.594 --> 09:38.962
I'm glad we found you.

09:39.898 --> 09:42.099
Find yer own pub.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.301
We're drinking our way
through this one.

09:44.368 --> 09:48.005
In fact, the whole street's
ours, pub-wise, so sod off.

09:48.605 --> 09:50.174
John, it's me.

09:52.142 --> 09:53.243
Clark Kent.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.546
You knew me as Superman.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.984
[grunting groggily]

10:04.521 --> 10:06.858
Oh, it is you.

10:06.925 --> 10:08.692
I thought you'd snuffed it.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.261
[grunts]

10:11.662 --> 10:12.830
[groans]

10:12.897 --> 10:14.965
Oh, bloody hell!

10:15.032 --> 10:16.333
Now you've done it.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.670
[Clark] John, wait.

10:19.736 --> 10:20.971
We're not here to fight.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.439
[low growl]

10:24.341 --> 10:25.944
[roaring]

10:26.009 --> 10:28.078
You come
to the wrong place, then.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.815
<i>Azarath Metrion...</i>

10:31.883 --> 10:34.585
[groans] Stop!

10:34.651 --> 10:36.687
- [distorted whispering]
- [Raven groans]

10:36.753 --> 10:37.621
Stop it!

10:43.427 --> 10:45.762
Quit playin' around, boy scout!
Smash 'em!

10:45.829 --> 10:47.364
I can't! [grunts]

10:49.600 --> 10:51.802
[roaring]

10:51.870 --> 10:53.604
Bloody useless, both of you.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.105
[chanting spell]

11:00.711 --> 11:02.479
[groans]

11:04.181 --> 11:05.950
A little help would be nice.

11:06.016 --> 11:07.150
[low growl]

11:15.592 --> 11:17.060
[low growl]

11:21.866 --> 11:22.833
Ugh!

11:22.901 --> 11:24.401
Bloody nuisance.

11:30.073 --> 11:32.809
- [roars]
- Last call, asshole.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.183
And I'm sober again.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.653
Magic can be such a bitch.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.128
Gift from Darkseid?

11:51.996 --> 11:53.530
Liquid Kryptonite...

11:53.597 --> 11:55.632
to keep me
from ever being a threat.

11:57.234 --> 11:58.502
So he let you live

11:58.569 --> 12:01.438
to wander about
demoralizing everyone.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.976
Impressive.

12:05.043 --> 12:08.612
- [distorted whispering]
- [groaning] Stop it, please.

12:08.679 --> 12:10.480
[Clark] She gets like this,
sometimes.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.956
[Trigon] <i>I will exact vengeance
on you, daughter!</i>

12:18.022 --> 12:19.023
<i>Release me,</i>

12:19.089 --> 12:21.625
<i>ungrateful spawn of mine!</i>

12:23.560 --> 12:25.495
That's what she hears
all the time.

12:25.562 --> 12:27.999
No wonder she's always in pain,

12:28.066 --> 12:30.133
and her healing powers
don't work.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.301
John,

12:31.368 --> 12:33.170
where are you going? We have...

12:33.236 --> 12:35.472
A plan
to save the world, right?

12:35.539 --> 12:38.675
And this time
it will definitely work.

12:38.742 --> 12:40.310
Bugger off, Clarkie.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.281
I told you he was
a waste of time.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.749
All cowards are.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.855
I didn't lead us all
into a massacre!

12:50.922 --> 12:52.356
You did!

12:52.422 --> 12:55.059
Zatanna was a hero
who fought bravely.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.327
But where were you
when she needed you most?

13:03.467 --> 13:06.169
Ah, piss off, both of you.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.376
Zatanna would want you
to hear us out.

13:14.578 --> 13:16.613
Below the belt, boy scout.

13:18.181 --> 13:20.918
More Parademons will be by.

13:20.985 --> 13:22.452
Come with if you want.

13:23.687 --> 13:24.554
Or not.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.823
What about you, Etrigan?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.362
Ugh! Whatever.

13:42.839 --> 13:44.374
[Raven] Love what you've
done with the place.

13:45.143 --> 13:46.576
[Constantine chuckles]

13:46.643 --> 13:49.346
What better metaphor
for merry old England today?

13:51.082 --> 13:51.949
Drink?

13:52.984 --> 13:54.651
You can use the good glasses.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.787
[Etrigan mumbles indistinctly]

13:58.923 --> 14:00.424
[groans softly]

14:00.490 --> 14:03.961
Been all mopey ever since
a friend of his died.

14:04.028 --> 14:05.796
Doesn't even rhyme anymore.

14:06.797 --> 14:08.665
What's the point?

14:11.735 --> 14:14.271
Look, are you going to help us
or not?

14:14.337 --> 14:17.175
Saving your asses in the bar
didn't count, eh?

14:17.240 --> 14:19.911
Offering whiskey
in an unbroken glass?

14:19.977 --> 14:21.913
Bloody ingrates, you are.

14:22.880 --> 14:23.881
So,

14:23.948 --> 14:25.849
it was crap from the start,

14:25.917 --> 14:27.551
but what went wrong, eh?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.486
Tell me what happened.

14:35.225 --> 14:37.895
[Clark] <i>Darkseid knew
every part of our plan.</i>

14:37.962 --> 14:39.830
[creatures growling]

14:39.897 --> 14:41.264
<i>Those things
that attacked us were</i>

14:41.331 --> 14:43.633
<i>half Parademon, half Doomsday.</i>

14:46.803 --> 14:49.073
<i>Barry and Hal fought hard,</i>

14:49.140 --> 14:50.507
<i>but were taken down.</i>

14:52.242 --> 14:54.644
[screaming]

14:55.980 --> 14:58.381
<i>The rest of us
didn't last much longer.</i>

15:01.185 --> 15:02.920
[screaming]

15:04.088 --> 15:05.789
[screaming]

15:06.924 --> 15:08.226
<i>Shazam was wounded,</i>

15:08.291 --> 15:10.027
<i>but Cyborg helped him escape.</i>

[groans]

15:14.464 --> 15:17.567
[screaming]

15:17.634 --> 15:19.703

15:21.438 --> 15:22.506
[Wonder Woman grunts]

15:23.074 --> 15:24.808
[groans]

15:24.876 --> 15:26.244
[screaming] No!

15:26.309 --> 15:28.179
[Batman grunting]

15:28.246 --> 15:29.312
[groans]

15:35.086 --> 15:37.287
[Clark] <i>Darkseid didn't
kill everyone.</i>

15:37.354 --> 15:39.891
<i>Some, he had plans for.</i>

15:40.892 --> 15:42.894
[screaming]

15:52.569 --> 15:54.738
[screaming]

15:57.942 --> 16:00.477
A few days later,
Darkseid sent those...

16:00.544 --> 16:02.512
"Paradooms" to Earth.

16:03.247 --> 16:04.681
We didn't have a chance.

16:06.583 --> 16:07.784
Does it hurt?

16:12.756 --> 16:14.091
Good.

16:14.158 --> 16:15.259
Even without powers,

16:15.325 --> 16:16.626
Clark is still fighting.

16:16.693 --> 16:18.695
You couldn't be
bothered to do it once.

16:25.335 --> 16:26.871
[Zatanna groaning]

16:29.207 --> 16:30.707
John!

16:31.242 --> 16:33.410
[straining]

16:33.476 --> 16:35.378
[screaming]

16:44.621 --> 16:46.123
[Constantine]
<i>Don't know why I ran.</i>

16:47.824 --> 16:49.559
Been up against
all sorts of bastards

16:49.626 --> 16:51.996
and I always stood tall.

16:52.063 --> 16:53.697
But this time I just ran.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.566
Why did I do that?

16:57.134 --> 16:58.035
Why?

17:05.309 --> 17:07.011
What do you need me for anyway?

17:07.078 --> 17:09.846
The magic you have left
works just as good as mine.

17:09.914 --> 17:11.915
We just need a locator spell.

17:12.884 --> 17:14.285
[laughs]

17:14.352 --> 17:16.020
A locator spell?

17:16.087 --> 17:18.622
And then you'll toddle off,
will ya?

17:19.857 --> 17:20.790
Fine.

17:25.262 --> 17:27.265
I need some gear, so sit tight.

17:27.330 --> 17:28.598
Etrigan,

17:28.665 --> 17:30.134
continue loafing.

17:31.135 --> 17:32.003
[Etrigan] Done.

18:00.364 --> 18:02.133
[rumbling]

18:21.319 --> 18:24.587
[Batman] The third planet reaper
is on the Earth's surface.

18:24.654 --> 18:26.857
Boring to the magma core
has begun.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.126
With that ordnance,

18:29.193 --> 18:30.527
the guardians of Oa

18:30.593 --> 18:32.964
will be forced
to bow before me,

18:33.030 --> 18:36.367
and the entire space sector
will be mine.

18:36.434 --> 18:39.669
Why was this not
completed earlier?

18:39.736 --> 18:41.439
[Batman] The damage done
to the Apokolips reactor

18:41.504 --> 18:44.875
- during the attack two years ago...
- Your attack.

18:46.143 --> 18:47.844
[Batman] My solution
is working,

18:47.912 --> 18:49.013
but the power generated is

18:49.080 --> 18:51.115
less than
your previous reactor.

18:53.384 --> 18:54.852
Perhaps my mind-molding

18:54.919 --> 18:58.889
didn't fully transform you
into a capable servant.

18:58.956 --> 19:02.759
Perhaps you'd serve me
better as a mindless drone.

19:04.929 --> 19:07.064
I am still your most
competent acolyte,

19:07.131 --> 19:08.265
Lord Darkseid.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.336
Your former teammate, Luthor,

19:12.403 --> 19:14.038
believes otherwise.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.374
Not surprising.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.343
Luthor's only interest
is saving his own skin.

19:19.410 --> 19:22.679
I only perform my duties
at your pleasure, my liege.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.350
I won't stand
for further delays.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.085
After all,

19:28.152 --> 19:30.988
a conqueror must conquer.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.027
[gulping]

19:38.429 --> 19:39.930
[belches]

19:40.597 --> 19:41.765
[Raven] Hmm.

19:41.831 --> 19:43.666
I thought there'd be fire.

19:43.733 --> 19:46.037
Only when I fart.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.272
[Lois] <i>We need
to reassess the situation.</i>

19:48.339 --> 19:50.607
<i>Gather our forces
to a new location.</i>

19:50.673 --> 19:52.842
<i>Another one just
landed in China.</i>

19:52.910 --> 19:54.412
Any idea what they're for?

19:54.478 --> 19:55.712
<i>No.</i>

19:55.779 --> 19:57.148
<i>But whatever it is
can't be good.</i>

19:57.214 --> 19:58.581
<i>We need to come up
with a new strat...</i>

20:00.284 --> 20:02.819
[groaning] Oh, no, come on.

20:02.887 --> 20:04.889
[Constantine] Let's get you
on your way, then.

20:11.495 --> 20:12.796
Who am I finding?

20:13.531 --> 20:14.899
Damian Wayne.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.302
Are you bloody daft, mate?

20:18.369 --> 20:21.505
And how exactly does
the baby bat help?

20:21.571 --> 20:22.772
What do you care?

20:24.674 --> 20:25.842
Cheers, then.

20:30.281 --> 20:33.817
[chanting spell]

20:41.358 --> 20:42.860
Okay,

20:42.927 --> 20:45.795
since I don't have a stocked
magical pantry anymore,

20:45.863 --> 20:47.664
I have to conjure a portal
from scratch

20:47.730 --> 20:49.467
big enough for all of us.

20:49.533 --> 20:51.402
Hmm, ten hours, give or take.

20:51.469 --> 20:53.670
Oh, and everyone has
to stay still while I do it.

20:53.736 --> 20:55.339
Oh, for fuck's sake.

20:55.406 --> 20:57.607
- <i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>
- Raven, no, you're too weak...

21:07.251 --> 21:10.254
[Luthor] I... I didn't mean
to imply anything of the sort.

21:10.321 --> 21:13.090
When Lord Darkseid asked
if I could do your job,

21:13.157 --> 21:15.658
I answered,
"Maybe one day" but...

21:15.725 --> 21:17.361
[Batman]
<i>Luthor, stop sniveling.</i>

21:19.696 --> 21:21.132
<i>Continue your report.</i>

21:22.199 --> 21:23.733
Yes, Batman.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.503
The last
of Earth's resources are

21:25.569 --> 21:27.338
being transferred to Apokolips.

21:27.404 --> 21:30.608
Everything will go according
to Darkseid's schedule.

21:30.673 --> 21:31.708
[clears throat]

21:31.774 --> 21:33.544
Um, do you know if

21:33.611 --> 21:36.280
I'm included
in His Lordship's plans?

21:36.347 --> 21:40.683
In a future where I'm alive
to serve you both?

21:40.750 --> 21:44.321
<i>My business is ensuring that
Darkseid's vision is executed</i>

21:44.388 --> 21:45.523
<i>so his reign spreads</i>

21:45.589 --> 21:47.757
<i>to every corner of the galaxy.</i>

21:49.059 --> 21:51.395
<i>Don't worry about your place
in those plans.</i>

21:51.462 --> 21:53.830
<i>Worry about doing
what I tell you.</i>

21:54.565 --> 21:56.534
Of course, Batman.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.800
[Batman] <i>Mmm.</i>

22:10.680 --> 22:11.982
[Raven groans]

22:20.790 --> 22:23.360
The infidels have breached
our sanctuary!

22:23.427 --> 22:24.361
Slay them!

22:26.463 --> 22:28.265
[assassins groaning]

22:28.332 --> 22:29.799
Are you happy now?

22:29.867 --> 22:31.135
Assassins!

22:34.804 --> 22:36.839
Some challenge.

22:37.341 --> 22:38.775
Yawn.

22:38.841 --> 22:40.743
[assassin grunts and groans]

22:42.546 --> 22:43.480
Ow!

22:51.622 --> 22:53.823
[both grunting]

22:54.892 --> 22:56.260
[Constantine chanting spell]

23:01.831 --> 23:03.901
[in monotone]
Etrigan the Slayer is here.

23:03.968 --> 23:06.470
Woe to you. And you.

23:08.205 --> 23:09.273
You also.

23:10.241 --> 23:11.841
[yawns]

23:11.909 --> 23:13.177
[Lady Shiva] Die, demon!

23:15.079 --> 23:16.746
[grunts]

23:16.813 --> 23:19.216
[straining and grunting]

23:20.551 --> 23:21.619
Whatever.

23:21.685 --> 23:23.820
[Lady Shiva continues grunting]

23:23.887 --> 23:25.122
[Raven groans softly]

23:28.926 --> 23:30.127
[Damian] Enough!

23:34.498 --> 23:35.366
[Lady Shiva groans]

23:48.312 --> 23:49.179
Hi.

23:51.282 --> 23:52.483
You.

23:52.549 --> 23:55.486
Damian, please listen to him.
[groans softly]

23:57.154 --> 23:58.656
What's wrong with her?

23:58.722 --> 24:00.591
How long have you got, mate?

24:00.658 --> 24:02.159
I know you hate me,

24:02.226 --> 24:04.395
but I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't necessary.

24:06.030 --> 24:07.331
[Raven groans softly]

24:09.533 --> 24:10.800
I'll let you live.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.102
For now.

24:18.475 --> 24:19.977
I like him.

24:26.483 --> 24:28.485
[snoring]

24:31.221 --> 24:32.356
Come on.

24:34.491 --> 24:36.994
[Raven groaning softly]

24:37.061 --> 24:39.029
[Trigon] <i>Ungrateful witch!</i>

24:39.096 --> 24:41.865
- <i>I will exact vengeance on you, daughter!</i>
- [Raven] No.

24:41.932 --> 24:44.435
- I won't let you.
- [Trigon] Release me!

24:44.501 --> 24:45.436
Never.

24:47.905 --> 24:52.309
It's only a matter
of time now, little bird.

24:53.944 --> 24:56.413
Only a matter of time.

24:58.182 --> 25:00.184
You're not getting out, Father.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.553
I have the will to do
what must be done.

25:08.092 --> 25:09.993
Impudent daughter!

25:10.060 --> 25:11.195
If you die,

25:11.261 --> 25:13.330
I am trapped in this hell.

25:13.764 --> 25:15.032
Free me!

25:15.099 --> 25:17.568
Remember what I told you.

25:18.302 --> 25:19.570
Release me

25:19.636 --> 25:22.172
or I will kill the boy.

25:23.107 --> 25:25.209
[Raven groans softly]

25:31.014 --> 25:32.649
[Damian] Is there a way
to cure her?

25:35.386 --> 25:38.322
You get Trigon out, and yeah,
she'd recover

25:38.389 --> 25:40.257
- but...
- But he destroys the world.

25:44.628 --> 25:45.829
[continues groaning softly]

25:45.896 --> 25:46.964
[gasps]

25:49.266 --> 25:50.768
Did you get any rest?

25:50.834 --> 25:51.902
Enough.

25:52.569 --> 25:53.570
Then come with me.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.877
You too, Kent.

25:58.942 --> 26:02.212
I want you to see what this war
has cost my family.

26:04.748 --> 26:07.684
Steal anything
and I'll cut your hands off.

26:11.655 --> 26:14.691
Oh, I really like him.

26:15.626 --> 26:17.995
[chomping]

26:20.464 --> 26:23.233
[Damian] I feared your plan
would fail from the beginning.

26:23.300 --> 26:26.069
An army without killers
is no army at all.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.038
But Batman believed in you.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.275
You cost me my father.

26:31.975 --> 26:33.410
<i>And my teammates.</i>

26:37.648 --> 26:39.049
<i>I won't forgive that.</i>

26:44.955 --> 26:47.224
[Robin grunts, groans]

26:52.796 --> 26:55.867
[Nightwing grunts, groans]

26:55.934 --> 26:57.401
[screams]

27:05.709 --> 27:06.878
Nightwing convinced me

27:06.945 --> 27:09.379
not to voice
my many objections.

27:09.446 --> 27:11.982
"There are always
risks in war," he said.

27:15.085 --> 27:16.720
He's not saying that anymore.

27:18.857 --> 27:22.059
[muttering indistinctly]

27:25.629 --> 27:26.497
[gasps]

27:28.900 --> 27:30.902
You used the Lazarus Pit.

27:30.969 --> 27:32.236
You said you wouldn't.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.371
You promised.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.141
He was my brother.

27:38.208 --> 27:40.110
I had to take a chance.

27:42.914 --> 27:44.314
It just didn't work.

27:45.917 --> 27:47.084
We can't let what happened

27:47.150 --> 27:49.453
to Dick and everyone else be
in vain.

27:50.354 --> 27:51.722
Help us fix things.

27:52.389 --> 27:53.190
How?

27:53.257 --> 27:54.658
You're powerless now.

27:54.725 --> 27:57.194
We need you
to get through to Batman.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.830
You can break
Darkseid's programming.

27:59.898 --> 28:01.131
You grossly overestimate

28:01.198 --> 28:03.367
the influence I have
on my father.

28:04.234 --> 28:06.036
Batman cares about you.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.073
Even awful parents
care about their kids.

28:10.975 --> 28:12.643
I should know.

28:12.709 --> 28:15.579
[Clark] I was there when Bruce
learned about Dick's death.

28:15.646 --> 28:16.813
It affected him.

28:16.881 --> 28:18.181
It almost got through.

28:20.985 --> 28:24.521
[Damian] He overcame
my mother's brainwashing once.

28:24.588 --> 28:27.190
If anyone could
survive Darkseid's programming,

28:27.257 --> 28:28.458
it'd be father.

28:29.159 --> 28:30.427
So you'll try?

28:31.795 --> 28:34.197
It's my responsibility
to save him,

28:34.264 --> 28:36.733
or barring that,
kill him if he can't be saved.

28:39.303 --> 28:40.604
He would want that.

28:43.540 --> 28:45.742
But the only way to Apokolips
is to use the boom tube

28:45.809 --> 28:47.311
in LexCorp Tower.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.246
How do you expect to do that?

29:01.025 --> 29:02.259
[groans]

29:05.063 --> 29:06.296
You're getting worse.

29:06.363 --> 29:08.532
Ugh. Great pep talk.

29:09.934 --> 29:11.268
Here, let me help.

29:16.273 --> 29:19.242
Lois said she was negotiating
with their leader.

29:19.309 --> 29:20.577
She's a people person,

29:20.644 --> 29:23.014
so I'm sure
the situation's well in...

29:23.081 --> 29:24.615
- [crowd cheering]
- ...hand.

29:27.718 --> 29:28.585
[groans]

29:31.956 --> 29:33.590
[spits]

29:33.657 --> 29:34.725
Nice hook.

29:34.791 --> 29:35.860
Where'd you pick that up?

29:36.928 --> 29:38.428
I'm an army brat.

29:38.495 --> 29:41.665
Well, no one out-brats me.

29:42.332 --> 29:43.834
[Harley grunting]

29:43.901 --> 29:46.570
[cheering] Yeah. Ha-ha.

29:46.637 --> 29:47.939
Lois?

29:48.006 --> 29:50.340
- Lois!
- She looks like she can handle herself.

29:50.407 --> 29:52.110
Come on, Harley, have at her!

29:52.175 --> 29:53.945
Nothing like having a cold one

29:54.012 --> 29:55.947
while a couple of fine sheilas
beat each other bloody, eh, mate?

29:56.014 --> 29:57.547
[laughing] Beer?

29:58.749 --> 30:00.350
Break her face...

30:01.085 --> 30:02.686
Clark's wife!

30:02.753 --> 30:04.022
Ugh. Brits.

30:04.088 --> 30:05.155
Aussies.

30:05.222 --> 30:06.891
- Poms.
- Convicts.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.059
- Wankers.
- Wankers.

30:08.126 --> 30:09.660
Do your best, honey!

30:10.694 --> 30:12.496
[both grunting]

30:16.233 --> 30:17.300
Ha-ha!

30:20.370 --> 30:21.738
You've got to be kidding.

30:21.805 --> 30:23.240
Always!

30:23.306 --> 30:25.342
- Harley, come on!
- [cheering]

30:38.923 --> 30:40.557
[groaning]

30:41.458 --> 30:44.361
[exclaiming hysterically]

30:44.428 --> 30:47.798
I tawt I taw a puddy tat.

30:47.865 --> 30:49.167
[groans]

30:49.232 --> 30:51.234
- [Boomerang] Ooh!
- [all cheering]

30:55.873 --> 30:57.507
Way to go, ya beauty!

30:57.574 --> 30:59.810
And the winner
and new champion,

30:59.877 --> 31:01.578
luscious Lois Lane!

31:01.645 --> 31:03.413
[cheering]

31:06.750 --> 31:08.953
Captain Boomerang
at your service.

31:09.020 --> 31:10.587
Have I mentioned that I'm, uh,

31:10.654 --> 31:12.823
quite experienced "down under,"
if ya know what I mean?

31:14.491 --> 31:16.793
No means no, Boomerang!

31:17.895 --> 31:18.896
All right, lady.

31:18.963 --> 31:20.831
Looks like we've got a deal.

31:20.898 --> 31:22.632
Listen up, everybody!

31:22.699 --> 31:25.069
Now we ride for Lex Luthor

31:25.136 --> 31:28.005
in his fortress of bald-itude.

31:28.072 --> 31:29.272
So drink up,

31:29.339 --> 31:31.175
esteemed ladies and gents

31:31.241 --> 31:33.211
of the Suicide Squad,

31:33.276 --> 31:35.245
because tomorrow

31:35.312 --> 31:38.149
we take back this planet!

31:38.216 --> 31:39.382
[all cheering]

31:45.957 --> 31:47.724
Why do you always
lead with your chin?

31:47.791 --> 31:49.994
[scoffing] I learned
from the best.

31:51.695 --> 31:52.629
Ow!

31:56.666 --> 31:58.970
Oh, bollocks, it's my ex.

31:59.036 --> 32:00.303
You and Harley?

32:01.072 --> 32:02.272
Gross.

32:02.339 --> 32:03.774
Do I look mad?

32:07.211 --> 32:09.446
[laughs menacingly]

32:12.415 --> 32:14.584
How did Amanda Waller
let a lunatic like you

32:14.651 --> 32:16.486
become leader of the Squad?

32:17.121 --> 32:19.289
Easy. She died.

32:19.356 --> 32:20.590
Cancer!

32:20.657 --> 32:22.325
[laughs hysterically]

32:28.765 --> 32:31.301
Sorry.
It's a defense mechanism.

32:32.769 --> 32:34.138
King Shark

32:34.205 --> 32:35.639
is a shark.

32:37.707 --> 32:40.310
A week after that,
my puddin' died.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.345
Thanks to new Batman,

32:42.412 --> 32:44.916
who is no fun, by the way.

32:45.649 --> 32:46.817
So, me and my merry band

32:46.884 --> 32:49.586
of suicidals
decided to go freelance.

32:49.653 --> 32:51.655
We've been taking our cut
from Luthor's supply trains

32:51.721 --> 32:53.590
since this shitshow started.

32:54.791 --> 32:57.028
We're real Robin Hood-types.

32:57.094 --> 33:00.463
Rob from the rich
and sell to the poor.

33:00.530 --> 33:01.966
"Give to the poor."

33:02.699 --> 33:03.466
Huh?

33:03.533 --> 33:04.801
That can't be right.

33:05.802 --> 33:07.305
Do you have somewhere private?

33:07.370 --> 33:08.772
You need to see this.

33:08.839 --> 33:10.274
My office.

33:10.340 --> 33:14.245
We'll discuss everything over
my top-notch bottle of hooch.

33:14.312 --> 33:15.947
Now we're talking.

33:16.881 --> 33:17.747
[groans softly]

33:18.582 --> 33:20.417
No! I won't let you!

33:20.483 --> 33:21.953
Never!

33:22.019 --> 33:22.887
[straining]

33:24.021 --> 33:25.822
I think I need a minute.

33:25.890 --> 33:27.691
Is there a place we could rest?

33:27.757 --> 33:31.095
Oh, is that what you kids are
callin' it these days?

33:33.530 --> 33:35.599
Cheetah'll show you the way.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.367
I don't like kids.

33:37.434 --> 33:39.070
Sticky hands.

33:47.044 --> 33:47.912
[Raven groaning softly]

33:49.881 --> 33:52.549
- [distorted whispers]
- Shut up.

33:56.220 --> 33:57.687
Sorry.

33:57.754 --> 34:00.091
Sometimes he gets so loud
I have to answer.

34:01.859 --> 34:03.526
You probably think I'm weak.

34:04.362 --> 34:05.695
Raven,

34:05.762 --> 34:07.831
you're one of
the strongest people I know.

34:12.502 --> 34:14.536
So, how'd you end up with Kent?

34:15.804 --> 34:17.641
You left and I was alone.

34:20.344 --> 34:22.079
<i>I just wanted to end the pain.</i>

34:46.436 --> 34:48.471
I'm sorry for not
coming with you.

34:50.806 --> 34:51.943
When I asked you to join me

34:52.009 --> 34:54.145
in leading
the League of Assassins,

34:54.210 --> 34:56.746
I wasn't doing it
because you're a good fighter,

34:57.348 --> 34:58.215
I...

34:59.649 --> 35:01.085
I had feelings for you.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.521
If you didn't,
you made the right decision.

35:05.622 --> 35:07.524
It wasn't that at all.

35:07.590 --> 35:10.094
I left because my father
wants to kill you.

35:11.195 --> 35:12.595
After everything,

35:12.662 --> 35:14.131
I couldn't risk that.

35:33.583 --> 35:36.087
[Lois] Darkseid's machines
have gone online in the Congo,

35:36.153 --> 35:39.023
China, and off the coast
of England.

35:39.756 --> 35:42.159
What the heck are they?

35:42.226 --> 35:45.029
[Lois] They phase the Earth's
magma into Darkseid's base.

35:46.163 --> 35:48.899
So these things
must be destroyed.

35:48.966 --> 35:50.901
That's a temporary solution.

35:50.968 --> 35:53.037
We need to blow up Apokolips.

35:53.670 --> 35:55.638
Oh, is that all?

35:55.705 --> 35:56.874
Piece of cake.

35:56.941 --> 35:59.143
We can't brute-force this.

35:59.210 --> 36:02.446
On Apokolips,
Darkseid has Paradooms.

36:02.512 --> 36:05.149
Parademons upgraded with
Superman's DNA,

36:06.183 --> 36:07.650
like Doomsday was.

36:07.717 --> 36:09.420
Don't rub it in, honey.

36:09.487 --> 36:12.589
We have to get them off of
Apokolips to have any chance.

36:13.623 --> 36:14.992
To do that, we plan on mounting

36:15.059 --> 36:18.496
simultaneous attacks
on two of the machines.

36:18.561 --> 36:19.796
That should cause the Paradooms

36:19.864 --> 36:22.532
to be sent to Earth
as reinforcements.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.135
Why not attack all three?

36:25.403 --> 36:29.073
We don't have enough people.

36:29.140 --> 36:32.609
If the two teams do enough
damage, we'll be fine.

36:32.675 --> 36:35.712
The boom tube gate is
located in LexCorp Tower.

36:38.648 --> 36:40.583
That's where we come in.

36:40.650 --> 36:41.986
We take the tower.

36:42.053 --> 36:44.687
Our strike team
transports to Apokolips,

36:44.754 --> 36:46.790
sets its power generator
to go critical,

36:46.857 --> 36:48.225
reverses the boom tubes,

36:48.292 --> 36:50.494
bringing all the Paradooms
back to Apokolips,

36:50.560 --> 36:52.229
then we get out
before it blows up.

36:53.264 --> 36:56.599
Easy peasy, rich n' cheesy.
Ha-ha!

36:56.666 --> 36:59.702
King Shark is a shark.

36:59.769 --> 37:02.572
Aren't you forgetting
one small detail,

37:02.639 --> 37:04.808
name of Darkseid?

37:04.875 --> 37:07.378
"Warm beer, soggy chips" here
is right.

37:07.445 --> 37:09.113
We can't take him.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.514
No one can.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.349
Darkseid is going to Oa.

37:12.416 --> 37:14.518
We only begin after he's gone.

37:14.584 --> 37:18.155
Once we're there, we shut down
the portal so he can't come back.

37:18.222 --> 37:21.025
Without Apokolips,
he can't destroy Earth.

37:21.892 --> 37:23.693
How do you know he'll be gone?

37:23.760 --> 37:26.130
Did you steal his diary?

37:26.197 --> 37:29.300
I have a source in Darkseid's
camp called "Sleeper."

37:29.366 --> 37:32.903
He or she has been slipping me
information for months.

37:32.970 --> 37:34.972
[Robin] No wonder you and Kent
are together.

37:35.973 --> 37:38.342
You're both gullible fools.

37:38.409 --> 37:40.277
Darkseid is playing you.

37:40.344 --> 37:42.012
Or Batman is.

37:42.079 --> 37:43.613
The information
from Lois' source

37:43.680 --> 37:47.118
has led to every victory
we've had since the conquest.

37:47.184 --> 37:50.287
You have a strange concept
of "victory," mate.

37:50.354 --> 37:53.924
The planet's molten core
will be gone in a week.

37:53.991 --> 37:56.560
Then it's game over.

37:56.626 --> 38:00.663
I know this plan has astronomical
risks and impossible odds,

38:00.730 --> 38:02.099
but we're out of time.

38:04.935 --> 38:08.606
Blah, blah, blah.
Let's do this thing!

38:11.542 --> 38:13.377
[tires screeching]

38:18.282 --> 38:20.750
Hi, we need your van.

38:20.817 --> 38:22.853
- [low growl]
- [both gasp]

38:23.487 --> 38:25.956
[men screaming]

38:29.026 --> 38:31.095
Ah, crikey. That's not right.

38:42.339 --> 38:43.706
Yeah, g'day.

38:43.773 --> 38:45.543
[coughing and clearing throat]

38:45.609 --> 38:48.145
[mumbling indistinctly]

38:48.212 --> 38:50.114
My friend here was
attacked by thugs.

38:50.181 --> 38:52.116
We killed 'em right back. Yup.

38:52.183 --> 38:54.251
Yes, siree Bob. You betcha.

38:54.318 --> 38:56.587
- Gotta get my friend to a doc. How are you? [chuckles]
- [Harley coughs]

38:56.654 --> 38:57.720
Can we go?

39:00.723 --> 39:02.393
[gate buzzer sounds]

39:07.198 --> 39:09.633
[Batman] Lord Darkseid,
reports indicate that

39:09.699 --> 39:11.734
the lanterns
have mostly fallen.

39:11.801 --> 39:12.870
[Darkseid] Good.

39:14.038 --> 39:17.474
I go to claim Oa for my empire.

39:17.541 --> 39:19.610
Any remaining resistance

39:19.677 --> 39:21.844
shall not be a problem.

39:23.981 --> 39:25.983
Do not interrupt me.

39:27.551 --> 39:28.818
Yes, master.

39:47.938 --> 39:50.441
- [computer beeps]
- It's Sleeper. Darkseid's gone.

39:50.507 --> 39:53.143
I'm sending the signal
to attack the machines.

39:54.511 --> 39:56.213
<i>China team has engaged.</i>

40:03.687 --> 40:05.189
[creatures screeching]

40:06.056 --> 40:08.325
North Sea team engaged.

40:08.392 --> 40:10.561
Orchid's with them, John.

40:10.628 --> 40:13.864
Wonder where she went after she
kicked me out of the house.

40:25.609 --> 40:26.543
[creatures screeching]

40:35.586 --> 40:37.054
[Batman] <i>Why have
the rebels been able</i>

40:37.121 --> 40:39.590
<i>to stage these attacks
on our reapers?</i>

40:39.657 --> 40:40.991
How the hell should I know?

40:41.058 --> 40:44.061
I don't do security
for the entire Earth.

40:44.128 --> 40:45.795
Isn't that your job?

40:46.664 --> 40:48.299
[Batman] <i>Hmm.</i>

40:48.365 --> 40:50.301
I say that
with all due respect.

40:53.170 --> 40:55.506
<i>Stand ready to
transport the Paradooms.</i>

40:57.074 --> 40:58.509
On your mark.

40:58.575 --> 41:00.010
[computer beeps]

41:00.077 --> 41:01.478
What's wrong?

41:01.545 --> 41:03.113
I'm not getting a signal
that any of the Paradooms

41:03.180 --> 41:04.748
have left Apokolips.

41:04.814 --> 41:06.650
- Another debacle.
- Damian.

41:06.717 --> 41:07.985
We should have waited,

41:08.052 --> 41:09.386
we should have gathered
a third force.

41:09.453 --> 41:10.621
This is my fault.

41:10.688 --> 41:11.821
I'll sort this.

41:21.432 --> 41:22.800
You here?

41:22.866 --> 41:26.337
I thought I'd pop by to discuss
fertilizer and the such.

41:33.143 --> 41:35.446
There you are, Swampy.

41:35.512 --> 41:38.949
You are wiser than I
give you credit for.

41:39.016 --> 41:41.752
Well, not a high bar, I gather.

41:41.819 --> 41:44.288
One day, Constantine.

41:44.355 --> 41:45.589
One day.

41:45.656 --> 41:47.257
You're leaving already?

41:47.324 --> 41:48.926
But just know that
this thing here

41:48.992 --> 41:51.528
will be the death
of your precious green.

41:58.102 --> 41:59.236
[Swamp Thing] It...

41:59.303 --> 42:02.272
steals the heart of the planet?

42:02.339 --> 42:06.276
And you, you walking salad,
you didn't notice, did you?

42:06.343 --> 42:09.780
Just happy that half the people
on the planet are dead, eh?

42:09.847 --> 42:13.283
The humans earned their fate.

42:13.350 --> 42:16.420
By that logic
the green has it coming, too.

42:16.487 --> 42:19.156
Like humanity,
it was minding its own business

42:19.223 --> 42:22.659
and, oh, too bad,
death sentence.

42:24.495 --> 42:26.397
The green

42:26.463 --> 42:29.666
will not die!

42:34.037 --> 42:35.105
[creatures screeching]

42:41.211 --> 42:43.347
Swampy's pretty pissed.

42:43.414 --> 42:46.083
That should bring down
the flyin' uglies.

42:46.150 --> 42:47.217
[computer beeps]

42:48.485 --> 42:49.653
It worked.

42:49.720 --> 42:50.889
Harley, you're up.

42:50.954 --> 42:52.456
[Harley] <i>Yahtzee!</i>

Hey, you want
a boomerang? [grunts]

What about you? And you!

None can resist Darkseid.

Hail Darkseid.

I am the source wall.

01:04:28.518 --> 01:04:31.354
Lord Darkseid
has ordered you taken alive

Just stop saying "Darkseid."

01:05:04.088 --> 01:05:05.756
I must alert Lord Darkseid.

- I am the source wall...
- What are you doing, Constantine?

01:05:07.691 --> 01:05:08.993
[Constantine] Techno magic.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.029
Feels like taking a test
you haven't studied for.

01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:14.464
Luckily, I cheat.

Excellent technique, Mera.

01:05:52.103 --> 01:05:53.737
Now, let's find our friends.

No! Stop!

I'm fully integrated, Clark.

01:06:04.081 --> 01:06:07.818
There's not enough left of me
to ever leave this place.

01:06:07.885 --> 01:06:10.520
Now, listen, Batman stepped out
to talk to the big...

01:06:10.587 --> 01:06:12.656
[Batman] Batman's returned.

01:06:12.722 --> 01:06:14.926
And with his lord and master.

01:06:17.228 --> 01:06:18.930
You! [growls]

01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:29.006
I knew
Clark would come one day.

01:06:29.073 --> 01:06:30.774
It was inevitable.

01:06:30.841 --> 01:06:32.409
But I never thought
you'd be part

01:06:32.475 --> 01:06:34.544
of a lost cause, Constantine.

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:37.048
I'm here
to level the playing field.

01:06:37.114 --> 01:06:39.616
No running this time.

01:06:39.683 --> 01:06:43.520
Maybe Zatanna's loss
finally broke you. [chuckles]

01:06:43.587 --> 01:06:46.523
Was drinking yourself to death
not fast enough?

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:49.492
You won't pick us apart
so easily, Father.

01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:51.628
You dare call me that?

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:58.035
Your mother drugged me
to conceive you,

01:06:58.102 --> 01:06:59.971
goaded me into raising you,

01:07:00.037 --> 01:07:01.939
and broke me mentally.

01:07:02.006 --> 01:07:05.475
But once my eyes were
opened by Lord Darkseid,

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.744
I see you were never my son.

01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:11.048
Only a burden.

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:13.918
Don't listen to him, Damian.

01:07:13.985 --> 01:07:15.052
That's Darkseid talking.

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:18.788
Come, then.

01:07:18.856 --> 01:07:21.959
End your burden
once and for all.

01:07:22.026 --> 01:07:25.963
[Darkseid] Why is the whelp
still alive?

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.165
Correct this, Batman.

01:07:31.903 --> 01:07:35.006

I let you win.

This time...

01:07:50.388 --> 01:07:51.989
I won't hold back.

01:08:49.113 --> 01:08:50.714
Finish him, Batman.

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:52.416
Finish him and take your place

01:08:52.482 --> 01:08:55.086

You heard me, slave.

01:09:13.437 --> 01:09:14.604
Finish him.

is spoken!

I'm offering you
a willing magical host.

Let's kill the bastard.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:43.227
I have a better idea.

01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:17.161
What have you done, Kryptonian?

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:19.530
Not the Kryptonian.

01:11:19.597 --> 01:11:21.664
Not anymore.

I know I wasn't the ideal son,

but you took me in
and welcomed me.

01:12:11.814 --> 01:12:13.951
You taught me a better way.

01:12:14.018 --> 01:12:16.020
And I thank you for that.

01:12:16.086 --> 01:12:17.388

You.

You took everything

01:16:57.534 --> 01:16:59.102
He thought we should have
a backup plan

01:16:59.169 --> 01:17:01.004
in case everything went wrong.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.408
Can you forgive me?

01:17:05.843 --> 01:17:07.110
'Course I do!

01:17:07.177 --> 01:17:09.413
I get to spend eternity
with you.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.281
First question,

01:17:11.348 --> 01:17:13.317
are there any pubs?

01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:15.252
If not, we build one.

01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:17.254
[chuckling] Next time.

01:17:17.321 --> 01:17:19.423
Today, our friends
still need your help.

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.627
Oh, come on, Zee.

01:17:24.194 --> 01:17:25.562
I did my bit.

01:17:26.497 --> 01:17:27.397
I'm dead.

01:17:28.599 --> 01:17:29.833
John Constantine,

01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:32.636
you of all people should know
that means nothing

01:17:32.703 --> 01:17:34.471
when destiny's involved.

01:17:41.612 --> 01:17:42.613
Damian...

01:17:44.448 --> 01:17:45.315
I...

01:17:45.849 --> 01:17:47.384
[sobbing]

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.787
I love you.

01:18:02.366 --> 01:18:04.234
[Zatanna]
Goodbye for now, John.

01:18:09.874 --> 01:18:11.441
[screeching]

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.346
[gasps]

01:18:16.413 --> 01:18:18.282
[coughs]

01:18:18.348 --> 01:18:20.684
Holy shit, he's alive.

01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:22.419
How are you alive?

01:18:22.486 --> 01:18:24.621
I can't even be
a corpse in peace!

01:18:24.688 --> 01:18:27.524
Wanking destiny
can go bugger itself.

01:18:37.734 --> 01:18:38.769
[gasps softly]

01:18:42.439 --> 01:18:44.207
You brought me back.

01:18:45.977 --> 01:18:47.678
I had to take the chance.

01:18:49.914 --> 01:18:51.081
[Trigon straining]

01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:53.550
[Trigon] Release me!

01:18:53.617 --> 01:18:56.520
Bet you wish you had taken
my offer now, eh, wanker?

01:18:58.355 --> 01:19:00.257
We're going to talk
when this is done.

01:19:01.124 --> 01:19:03.126
Now, what's the bloody plan?

01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:08.832
Vic, do we have a way out?

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.400
- Working on it.
- [thudding]

01:19:28.987 --> 01:19:30.420
Damian...

01:19:30.487 --> 01:19:32.222
those things I said...

01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:34.358
Don't make this
overly emotional, Father,

01:19:34.424 --> 01:19:36.126
it wasn't your fault.

01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:38.261
I've relinked
with the Mother Box.

01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:39.931
I can transport you
off the station

01:19:39.998 --> 01:19:41.866
and bring back the Paradooms.

01:19:41.933 --> 01:19:45.702
Then I send Apokolips
to no destination at all.

01:19:45.769 --> 01:19:48.505
Darkseid is trapped with
his monsters forever.

01:19:52.442 --> 01:19:54.578
We're not leaving Clark behind.

01:19:54.645 --> 01:19:55.980
That won't work.

01:19:56.047 --> 01:19:58.749
Darkseid needs to be distracted
for me to do my thing.

01:20:02.519 --> 01:20:04.956
Yeah, yeah, let me think.

01:20:05.023 --> 01:20:06.623
Still pissed at you.

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:08.860
[Trigon straining and groaning]

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:13.830
You can't be serious.

01:20:13.898 --> 01:20:14.765
Uh-huh.

01:20:16.868 --> 01:20:18.102
On second thought...

01:20:18.168 --> 01:20:19.736
that's perfect.

01:20:19.803 --> 01:20:21.304
All together now.

01:20:21.371 --> 01:20:24.307
[both] <i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:34.451
You have spirit, Kryptonian.

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:37.421
But the strength
of a lost love is only...

01:20:44.227 --> 01:20:46.064
Go!

01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:50.233
Unless you would fight me
for the right to destroy him.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:00.811
And now,

01:21:00.878 --> 01:21:02.412
new god,

01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:05.682
let's see who shall rule,

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:09.286
and who shall serve!

01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:16.259
[creatures screeching]

01:21:23.134 --> 01:21:25.635
Okay, bus is leaving.
There'll be no better time.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.808
Victor?

01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:33.211
Can't come.

01:21:33.276 --> 01:21:34.611
Download your consciousness

01:21:34.678 --> 01:21:36.881
into a mother cube, or whatnot.

01:21:36.948 --> 01:21:38.448
It doesn't work
like that, genius.

01:21:38.515 --> 01:21:39.951
Now leave,
before these assholes realize

01:21:40.017 --> 01:21:41.685
they're gonna be
trapped here forever.

01:21:42.954 --> 01:21:43.820
Cheers.

01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:52.262
Go on, I'm right behind you.

01:22:04.775 --> 01:22:07.711
What a wonderful gift,
daughter.

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:09.881
Be well!

01:22:14.152 --> 01:22:15.552
Goodbye, Father.

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.893
Looks like I get the last word.

01:22:24.028 --> 01:22:25.595
Suck it, bitches!

01:22:28.933 --> 01:22:30.902
- [Trigon laughs]
- [Darkseid] No!

01:22:31.768 --> 01:22:35.405
You're mad! No!

01:23:42.472 --> 01:23:43.941
What news?

01:23:44.008 --> 01:23:45.709
Even though
the planet reapers were stopped

01:23:45.775 --> 01:23:47.477
before they finished,

01:23:47.544 --> 01:23:48.913
the damage was done.

01:23:49.713 --> 01:23:50.948
How bad?

01:23:51.015 --> 01:23:54.051
[Batman] We lost 31%
of the Earth's molten core.

01:23:54.118 --> 01:23:56.820
The planet's rotation
is compromised.

01:23:56.888 --> 01:24:00.724
The smallest change either way
will mean freezing or burning.

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:03.027
My best estimate is
another billion deaths

01:24:03.094 --> 01:24:05.695
before we can get anything
under control.

01:24:06.297 --> 01:24:07.764
Provided we can.

01:24:09.499 --> 01:24:11.269
[Superman] Okay.

01:24:11.335 --> 01:24:13.170
I know everyone's
been through hell,

01:24:13.237 --> 01:24:14.504
but we can't quit.

01:24:14.571 --> 01:24:16.173
The Justice League

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.540
doesn't quit.

01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:22.445
If we work together,
we can do this.

01:24:23.546 --> 01:24:25.649
We can save the planet.

01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:30.154
You know what you
have to do, mate.

01:24:31.222 --> 01:24:32.189
Clear the board...

01:24:32.924 --> 01:24:33.925
start again.

01:24:35.026 --> 01:24:36.459
Another Flashpoint?

01:24:38.396 --> 01:24:40.730
I promised Iris before she...

01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:43.633
[sighs]

01:24:45.102 --> 01:24:46.037
I can't.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.608
Yeah, figured you'd say that.

01:24:55.413 --> 01:24:56.746
Everything would change.

01:24:57.882 --> 01:24:58.748
Again.

01:25:01.818 --> 01:25:04.855
And some of those changes
may be shite.

01:25:04.922 --> 01:25:07.490
And we may make
the same mistakes again.

01:25:08.825 --> 01:25:10.493
It won't be perfect...

01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:15.900
but it'll be a long sight
better than what we got now.

01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:21.738
[sighs]

01:25:30.915 --> 01:25:33.117
[heroic instrumental music
playing]

01:25:55.672 --> 01:25:56.907
[distant explosion]
