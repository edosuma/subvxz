02:08.585 --> 02:10.484
Alright.
Come on then.

02:53.629 --> 02:57.131
No excuse tonight.
It was your accomplices.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.267
I have no accomplices.

02:59.269 --> 03:00.638
Oh.

03:01.938 --> 03:04.275
I found the guns.

03:05.842 --> 03:09.146
If you don't cooperate,
they'll charge you with treason.

03:12.383 --> 03:13.749
And I have no interest
in seeing you

03:13.751 --> 03:15.687
punished unnecessarily.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.721
I sympathize
with the Young Irelanders.

03:20.723 --> 03:23.090
No, you don't.

03:23.092 --> 03:24.828
You're a puppet of the crown.

03:25.895 --> 03:26.997
Yeah.

03:28.831 --> 03:30.631
Mm-hm.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.135
A subject.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.506
Loyal subject.

03:36.673 --> 03:39.143
So feck off
back home to England then.

03:41.044 --> 03:44.749
I prefer here, Mr. McCormack,
I find it challenging.

03:47.683 --> 03:49.351
There's no place now
that you get someone

03:49.353 --> 03:50.722
to tell the truth.

03:51.955 --> 03:54.826
<i>Or does England
not want you anymore?</i>

04:04.467 --> 04:06.137
Accomplices?

04:36.533 --> 04:38.365
<i>Well, inspector</i>

04:38.367 --> 04:40.872
has the prisoner been
cooperative?

04:42.505 --> 04:44.305
Not really. No.

04:51.848 --> 04:53.216
He's dead.

05:13.737 --> 05:15.670
<i>In the year of 1845</i>

05:15.672 --> 05:19.274
<i>a terrible famine
descended upon Ireland.</i>

05:19.276 --> 05:21.142
<i>Within a few short years</i>

05:21.144 --> 05:24.314
<i>one in four of our people
would be gone forever.</i>

05:25.581 --> 05:28.884
<i>Fled to England
and North America.</i>

05:28.886 --> 05:31.789
<i>Or dead from starvation
and fever.</i>

05:33.357 --> 05:35.656
<i>Irishmen who had enlisted
to fight</i>

05:35.658 --> 05:39.493
<i>for the occupying British crown
in its foreign wars</i>

05:39.495 --> 05:43.832
<i>returned home to find
only death and destruction</i>

05:43.834 --> 05:45.933
<i>in every corner of the land.</i>

05:58.048 --> 06:01.582
<i>Seen by many as traitors
to their own people</i>

06:01.584 --> 06:04.185
<i>they looked on helplessly</i>

06:04.187 --> 06:06.421
<i>as their country
continued to choke</i>

06:06.423 --> 06:09.156
<i>under the rule
of the British Empire.</i>

07:25.201 --> 07:27.170
Beartla O'Naughton.

07:29.706 --> 07:31.776
Martin O'Feeney.

07:36.413 --> 07:37.814
Where's my family?

07:42.752 --> 07:44.918
I'm sorry, Martin

07:44.920 --> 07:47.187
your mother died a year ago.

07:47.189 --> 07:49.026
Sick with the fever.

08:13.516 --> 08:15.086
Where's my brother?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.389
Hanged.

08:20.156 --> 08:21.623
Stabbed the bailiff
when they came

08:21.625 --> 08:23.026
to tumble the house.

08:33.635 --> 08:35.371
I couldn't help them.

08:36.072 --> 08:37.674
I had nothing.

16:32.581 --> 16:36.217
This is the final order
to vacate!

16:36.219 --> 16:40.588
This dwelling
will be rendered uninhabitable.

16:43.458 --> 16:47.261
We are taking the roof off!

16:49.865 --> 16:53.233
For your own safety,
come out now!

17:07.281 --> 17:08.684
Are you comin' out?

17:13.990 --> 17:15.125
Sergeant.

17:19.996 --> 17:22.162
What's your business here?

17:22.164 --> 17:23.363
Tell your men
to get off the roof.

17:23.365 --> 17:24.832
I'll pay whatever is owed.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.601
<i>Not a question of money.</i>

17:26.603 --> 17:28.501
The tenancy is illegal.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.506
<i>They moved in
from the side of the road.</i>

17:31.708 --> 17:33.177
Move back, please.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.482
At least let them leave
peacefully.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.452
How does this concern you?

17:44.453 --> 17:46.319
Let me talk to them.

17:46.321 --> 17:48.221
I won't ask you again.

17:48.223 --> 17:51.124
Stand down
and let this men do their job.

18:52.188 --> 18:53.888
Take that young man
into custody.

18:53.890 --> 18:55.259
You little thief.

18:56.893 --> 18:58.060
No!

18:58.661 --> 18:59.660
<i>Michael!</i>

19:22.417 --> 19:23.886
Michael!

19:26.722 --> 19:27.787
Get him out of here.

19:55.317 --> 19:56.752
That's his rifle.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.389
Here's his boots
and his other stuff.

20:10.232 --> 20:11.632
Breach of the peace.

20:11.634 --> 20:13.901
Interfering constabulary
business.

20:13.903 --> 20:15.436
Sergeant says
find out who he is

20:15.438 --> 20:17.174
and where he got the weapons.

20:23.179 --> 20:24.214
Name?

20:29.117 --> 20:30.287
Name?

20:32.087 --> 20:33.586
Go on, say it.

20:33.588 --> 20:35.658
Well, he can speak English,
alright.

20:49.838 --> 20:52.375
<i>Army musket.
Could be a deserter.</i>

21:13.663 --> 21:14.663
Huh?

21:27.910 --> 21:29.309
Where'd you get this then?

21:37.185 --> 21:40.120
The prisoner's lose!

21:40.122 --> 21:42.590
<i>Get back down here!</i>

21:42.592 --> 21:43.690
The prisoner..

21:47.163 --> 21:48.632
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

21:58.273 --> 21:59.907
Drop him!

22:00.977 --> 22:02.977
Drop him!

22:02.979 --> 22:04.879
Put him down!

22:25.000 --> 22:26.467
No, please.

25:36.357 --> 25:38.126
<i>Inspector Hannah.</i>

25:44.666 --> 25:46.935
<i>What would you say
to a stay of execution?</i>

26:06.454 --> 26:08.322
We've received reports
of a deadly attack

26:08.324 --> 26:11.491
on a Constabulary station
in Connemara.

26:11.493 --> 26:14.527
On the estate
of Lord Kilmichael.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.765
We believe this man,
originally from the area

26:17.767 --> 26:19.369
may have been involved.

26:20.469 --> 26:22.672
One of our Connaught rangers.

26:25.673 --> 26:28.475
Declared absent without leave
in Calcutta three months ago

26:28.477 --> 26:31.879
after breaking
his commanding officer's jaw.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.046
I understand that you know him.

26:34.048 --> 26:36.586
That you served together
in Afghanistan.

26:38.319 --> 26:40.155
That he is an effective soldier.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.093
He is.

26:48.963 --> 26:51.030
You'll be released
to accompany Captain Pope

26:51.032 --> 26:53.333
to Ballybrack and to assist him
in locating

26:53.335 --> 26:54.770
this Corporal Feeney.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.744
I'm retired
from military service.

27:02.144 --> 27:05.144
Yeah, but you must agree
that your particular expertise

27:05.146 --> 27:07.748
is better suited
to this line of work.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.752
I do not agree.

27:13.154 --> 27:15.421
Might I remind you, inspector

27:15.423 --> 27:17.457
that you're no longer
the decorated veteran

27:17.459 --> 27:20.360
the hero of the rank and file.

27:20.362 --> 27:22.796
You're an ineffective policeman.

27:22.798 --> 27:25.532
An embarrassment
to the Irish constabulary.

27:25.534 --> 27:27.467
A hero who is about to be tried

27:27.469 --> 27:30.003
for the murder
of the suspect McCormack

27:30.005 --> 27:32.275
for which you may be hanged.

27:33.675 --> 27:35.110
So think carefully.

27:39.647 --> 27:41.150
Are you agreeable?

27:49.124 --> 27:50.894
Remove the inspector's
restraints.

27:59.434 --> 28:01.301
Find this man.

28:01.303 --> 28:02.906
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

28:52.354 --> 28:53.756
Ah, it is yourself.

28:56.892 --> 28:58.894
I'm glad to see they let you go.

29:05.500 --> 29:06.935
Will you have a drop?

29:10.972 --> 29:12.008
You will.

29:34.930 --> 29:36.763
To your poor mother.

29:36.765 --> 29:38.134
God have mercy on her.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.441
She was a stubborn woman

29:48.443 --> 29:51.244
who'd rather starve
than take the soup.

29:51.246 --> 29:53.814
What could I do about that?

29:53.816 --> 29:55.815
"Just take it," I said to her.

29:55.817 --> 29:58.317
"Say what they want you to say."

29:58.319 --> 29:59.923
But she wouldn't.

30:10.332 --> 30:12.699
They'd torn
the roof off the house.

30:12.701 --> 30:14.801
I thought it better
to put an animal in it

30:14.803 --> 30:16.635
than to leave it idle.

30:16.637 --> 30:18.138
You know, your mother
was a cousin of mine

30:18.140 --> 30:21.411
better to keep it in the family
then let strangers get it.

30:22.778 --> 30:24.079
Much better.

30:27.449 --> 30:29.719
The judge,
who hanged my brother..

30:31.153 --> 30:33.487
...what was his name?

30:33.489 --> 30:34.824
Bolton.

30:40.628 --> 30:42.597
I'd give anything
to have them all back.

30:44.165 --> 30:48.104
Your mother, my brother.

30:49.471 --> 30:50.740
Michael.

30:51.507 --> 30:53.109
But I can't.

31:05.220 --> 31:06.588
Damp day.

31:07.955 --> 31:09.891
You should have kept
your powder dry.

31:47.996 --> 31:49.932
How far do you plan
to travel, captain?

31:51.633 --> 31:53.502
As far as we need to.

31:57.172 --> 31:59.905
I'm compiling a report
on the economics of famine

31:59.907 --> 32:02.042
in the west.

32:02.044 --> 32:04.276
Wexford Independent.

32:04.278 --> 32:05.679
Here.

32:05.681 --> 32:06.915
Free copy.

32:09.484 --> 32:12.254
"Galatians" chapter six,
verse seven.

32:14.856 --> 32:16.021
I beg your pardon.

32:16.023 --> 32:17.657
"For whatsoever a man soweth

32:17.659 --> 32:19.426
that shall he also reap."

32:19.428 --> 32:21.561
Drunkenness and fecklessness

32:21.563 --> 32:24.096
is the economics of famine
in the west.

32:24.098 --> 32:26.665
And the continued crop failure.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.602
Failures, sir, lies

32:28.604 --> 32:30.273
in the character of people.

32:35.576 --> 32:37.576
Explain your total
dependence upon the easiest

32:37.578 --> 32:40.113
grown staple learned to mankind.

32:41.884 --> 32:46.253
Potato was the only way to feed
so many over limited acreage.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.621
Food for the contented slave

32:47.623 --> 32:49.258
not the hardy and the brave.

33:26.761 --> 33:29.261
Ho-ho-ho,
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

33:29.263 --> 33:31.833
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh-shh-shh.

33:43.845 --> 33:46.412
These will do fine.
Thank you, lieutenant.

33:46.414 --> 33:49.815
Private, take Inspector Hannah
to the stables.

33:49.817 --> 33:53.753
Give him
whichever mount he chooses.

33:53.755 --> 33:54.824
Yes, sir.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.593
This way, inspector.

34:00.528 --> 34:03.298
So, that's the Hunter Hannah.

34:04.432 --> 34:05.798
In the flesh.

34:05.800 --> 34:10.469
Well, you need that kind of
steel where you're going.

34:10.472 --> 34:12.572
They say you're after a ranger

34:12.574 --> 34:14.672
who's taken up
with the Ribbonmen.

34:14.675 --> 34:19.079
I do not engage
in idle gossip, lieutenant.

34:19.081 --> 34:21.313
Nor should you.

34:21.315 --> 34:22.949
Have the horses ready at dawn

34:22.951 --> 34:24.382
<i>and your man
in plain clothes.</i>

34:24.385 --> 34:26.052
<i>We don't want to attract
any unnecessary attention</i>

34:26.054 --> 34:27.518
<i>do we?</i>

34:31.693 --> 34:33.429
Horik O'Se..

34:34.630 --> 34:36.929
...you stand accused
of stealing a sheep

34:36.931 --> 34:39.164
from the estate
of Lord Kilmichael.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.233
What say you?

34:44.438 --> 34:47.706
English is the language
of this court, Mr. O'Se.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.141
How do you plead?

34:51.045 --> 34:52.911
Silence.

34:52.914 --> 34:55.514
Your Honor, the man was only
trying to feed his children.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.316
He doesn't even speak English

34:57.318 --> 34:59.586
and it is the
legal obligation of the court

34:59.588 --> 35:02.755
to pay for a translator.
Where is the translator?

35:02.757 --> 35:06.592
Inability is one thing,
this man's obstinate refusal

35:06.594 --> 35:08.762
to speak a language
he clearly understand

35:08.764 --> 35:09.963
is another entirely.

35:09.965 --> 35:11.930
You leave me
no option, Mr. O'Se.

35:11.932 --> 35:13.967
<i>I find you guilty as charged</i>

35:13.969 --> 35:17.237
and I hereby sentence you
to six month hard labor

35:17.239 --> 35:18.737
followed by transportation..

35:21.476 --> 35:26.211
...to Port, to Port Arthur,
Van Diemen's Land

35:26.213 --> 35:27.713
seven years.
Remove the prisoner.

35:53.474 --> 35:55.210
State your business.

36:02.751 --> 36:04.784
You hanged my brother?

36:04.786 --> 36:06.318
I did nothing of the sort.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.421
If I did pass sentence
on this brother of yours

36:09.423 --> 36:12.758
I simply assessed the evidence
and interpreted the law

36:12.760 --> 36:14.693
the constabulary hanged him.

36:14.695 --> 36:16.862
Indeed some might say
that he hanged himself

36:16.864 --> 36:18.798
the day he choose
to commit his crime.

36:23.338 --> 36:24.606
Some might.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.374
I understand
that may further bolster

36:28.376 --> 36:30.844
your sense of injustice
to blame me

36:30.846 --> 36:32.878
for your brother's demise.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.548
But I do not cause
the crops to fail

36:35.550 --> 36:38.485
and I am not responsible
for people breaking the law.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.923
I'm merely a servant
of the court.

36:42.891 --> 36:44.427
I bid you good day.

37:21.429 --> 37:22.929
Good mornin', sir.

37:22.931 --> 37:24.032
Uh-huh.

37:34.775 --> 37:37.709
What do you think you're doing?

37:37.711 --> 37:39.979
Private Hobbs
is coming with us

37:39.981 --> 37:41.317
to serve as my orderly.

37:44.485 --> 37:46.621
And to tend to the horses.

37:48.556 --> 37:50.725
Time to earn that reprieve,
inspector.

38:14.615 --> 38:16.552
Who do you think
responsible, sergeant?

38:18.954 --> 38:21.787
Same Ribbonmen who burned down
the constabulary station

38:21.789 --> 38:23.492
and killed six of my men.

38:27.161 --> 38:28.961
A magistrate will be
a typical target

38:28.963 --> 38:30.231
for these Ribbonmen.

38:33.869 --> 38:35.805
What brings you here,
gentlemen?

38:36.938 --> 38:38.673
We're compiling a report.

38:40.242 --> 38:42.745
May I enquire as the nature
of this report?

38:44.346 --> 38:46.345
You may not.

42:26.501 --> 42:28.437
Was this Feeney?

42:32.740 --> 42:34.242
There was no robbery.

42:39.114 --> 42:40.849
Private, get outside
and keep watch.

42:56.498 --> 42:58.067
What does this mean?

43:15.849 --> 43:18.016
What was this man's name?

43:28.429 --> 43:30.199
What's this man's name?

43:31.532 --> 43:33.301
They don't have the English.

43:45.146 --> 43:46.749
Do you know
what happened here?

43:52.085 --> 43:53.254
Be quiet.

43:55.690 --> 43:56.791
Well?

43:57.692 --> 43:59.128
Well?

44:18.780 --> 44:23.148
The body belongs
to Beartla O'Naughton.

44:23.150 --> 44:25.753
Rent collector
for Lord Kilmichael.

44:27.088 --> 44:29.525
Somebody came into his house
and killed him.

44:30.757 --> 44:33.758
An unexpected end
for the pig

44:33.760 --> 44:36.030
but he'll be ate all the same.

44:42.003 --> 44:44.472
We're looking
for the Feeney house.

45:00.521 --> 45:02.457
There's the rest of him?

45:03.824 --> 45:05.191
He took over this holding

45:05.193 --> 45:07.461
when Mrs. Feeney was evicted.

45:10.697 --> 45:13.367
He learned that
from the Ghilzai.

45:15.202 --> 45:16.771
Afghanistan.

45:18.373 --> 45:21.340
I've not yet had the privilege
of foreign service

45:21.342 --> 45:23.175
Well that's their punishment..

45:23.177 --> 45:24.780
...for treachery.

45:28.983 --> 45:31.717
What happened to Mrs. Feeney?

45:31.719 --> 45:33.322
Without food or shelter..

45:34.389 --> 45:35.657
...she died.

45:54.208 --> 45:56.278
He's headed west.

45:59.514 --> 46:01.514
I suppose we continue west.

46:01.516 --> 46:03.452
You'll need a translator.

46:06.253 --> 46:07.521
How much?

46:08.222 --> 46:10.088
How much have you?

46:10.090 --> 46:12.027
You should inform
the constabulary.

46:13.427 --> 46:14.559
Our orders are clear, inspector

46:14.561 --> 46:16.862
we will not involve
local authorities.

46:16.864 --> 46:19.130
Well, that was before
we confirmed his identity

46:19.132 --> 46:21.700
we tell the police
we prevent him killing again.

46:21.702 --> 46:24.806
Confirming Feeney as the killer
does not complete our work.

46:26.708 --> 46:28.744
As you well know.

47:55.596 --> 47:57.865
every Sunday at service in town.

48:00.068 --> 48:01.670
What is your name, my child?

48:04.905 --> 48:06.273
Seamus O'Suilleabhan.

48:07.809 --> 48:09.244
James Sullivan.

48:11.144 --> 48:14.146
James Sullivan, do you renounce
the Roman Catholic Church?

48:18.385 --> 48:20.519
Do you wish
to have your soul cleansed?

48:26.427 --> 48:29.728
Have you made Jesus Christ
Lord of your life?

48:56.891 --> 48:59.728
We do not eat until
service is concluded.

49:08.034 --> 49:11.836
We nourish the soul
before we satisfy the flesh.

49:30.056 --> 49:32.526
It is not yet time to eat.

49:36.697 --> 49:39.034
You leave it any longer,
they'll all be dead.

49:40.400 --> 49:43.401
God's work comes first.

49:58.985 --> 50:00.554
No, Papists.

50:31.686 --> 50:32.621
Here.

50:51.806 --> 50:53.742
Is it true what they said?

50:54.675 --> 50:56.344
About your prisoner?

51:00.114 --> 51:01.882
I killed him, yeah.

51:10.490 --> 51:12.594
You were just doin' your job.

51:15.762 --> 51:17.396
Catch this man

51:17.398 --> 51:19.166
keep your pension..

51:20.300 --> 51:22.237
Fuckin' deserters.

51:25.539 --> 51:26.975
Cowards.

51:31.112 --> 51:34.749
No, it's not always cowardice
that makes men run.

51:37.083 --> 51:39.019
You know, they get tired..

51:40.755 --> 51:42.588
...angry.

51:42.590 --> 51:44.192
All they need is a home.

51:51.831 --> 51:53.768
Sometimes
you can talk to 'em..

51:54.802 --> 51:56.403
...bring 'em back.

52:02.208 --> 52:04.445
One of them even saved my life.

52:07.248 --> 52:09.380
He pulled me out
of an ambush.

52:09.382 --> 52:10.883
Just outside of Kabul.

52:10.885 --> 52:12.821
I thought I was finished.

52:15.523 --> 52:18.460
He was the
best soldier I ever met.

52:32.005 --> 52:33.371
He never fought
for the queen though

52:33.373 --> 52:35.276
just for his mates.

52:36.043 --> 52:37.646
Fucking Irish.

53:57.090 --> 53:59.027
Probably best to hold
our course.

54:04.197 --> 54:06.831
Two hours ride up that road

54:06.833 --> 54:09.269
is the house of a Mr. Cronin.

54:11.639 --> 54:13.572
Cronin evicted Feeney's mother.

54:13.574 --> 54:15.441
And a few days ago,
did the same thing

54:15.443 --> 54:18.209
to the brother's wife
and children.

54:18.211 --> 54:20.648
<i>He's Lord Kilmichael's
land agent.</i>

54:23.117 --> 54:24.419
Cronin?

54:29.123 --> 54:30.258

I'll fetch them.

55:04.692 --> 55:07.094
No, I'll get them.

55:23.010 --> 55:24.778
What's the hold-up?

55:31.452 --> 55:33.054
Who are you?

55:36.789 --> 55:38.259
What do you want?

55:44.697 --> 55:46.467
What? The harvest?

55:47.400 --> 55:49.002
I'm only an agent.

55:53.340 --> 55:54.943
For Lord Kilmichael.

55:56.710 --> 55:58.309
It's his land.

56:01.581 --> 56:02.951
It's his grain.

56:06.519 --> 56:08.255
I have money.

56:18.264 --> 56:20.467
Can I help ye, gentlemen?

56:21.969 --> 56:24.235
We're looking for Mr. Cronin.

56:24.237 --> 56:25.737
The master's not here, sir.

56:25.739 --> 56:29.441
He left for town
only a few moments ago.

56:29.443 --> 56:31.880
We didn't pass him
on the road.

56:49.195 --> 56:50.764
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

56:51.898 --> 56:53.433
Just take the horse.

58:59.092 --> 58:59.760
Fire!

59:01.094 --> 59:02.929
For God's sake, man, shoot him!

59:15.576 --> 59:17.374
You bloody idiot!

59:17.376 --> 59:19.012
You had him!

59:23.851 --> 59:25.086
<i>Dammit!</i>

01:00:03.257 --> 01:00:04.358
No.

01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:11.729
We will continue
to the police station in Carrick

01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.932
and send a dispatch rider
to warn Lord Kilmichael

01:00:13.934 --> 01:00:16.700
that his life's
in imminent danger.

01:00:16.702 --> 01:00:18.769
Orders or not,
I cannot allow the murder

01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:21.005
of a nobleman
for lack of a warning.

01:00:21.007 --> 01:00:22.907
Send one of Cronin's servants
to Carrick

01:00:22.909 --> 01:00:25.110
we'll stay on Feeney's trial.

01:00:25.112 --> 01:00:28.679
- Where does Kilmichael live?
- London.

01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:30.882
But when he is here,
the estate house.

01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:32.883
About days ride from here.

01:00:32.885 --> 01:00:34.418
<i>Let's go straight
to Kilmichael's.</i>

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.389
You're in no fit state,
Mr. Hannah.

01:00:37.324 --> 01:00:39.193
I'll be the judge of that.

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:49.133
Ah, Mr. Quinlivin.

01:00:49.135 --> 01:00:51.769
I wonder if it might be terrible
inconvenience to you

01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:53.671
if we borrowed
one of Mr. Cronin's horses.

01:00:53.673 --> 01:00:55.773
I'm afraid that would be
quite impossible, captain.

01:00:55.775 --> 01:00:56.807
Well, you see, you see...

01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:59.010
I doubt
that Mr. Cronin's family

01:00:59.012 --> 01:01:01.012
would condone
of my supporting the men

01:01:01.014 --> 01:01:02.680
who failed to warn them

01:01:02.682 --> 01:01:04.816
that their husband and father

01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:06.885
was the target of a madman.

01:01:06.887 --> 01:01:08.456
Good day to you.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:47.255
They sent you to get rid of me?

01:02:50.257 --> 01:02:51.559
Yeah.

01:02:56.195 --> 01:02:58.262
They can't afford to have
one of their own

01:02:58.264 --> 01:03:02.166
someone they called a hero
turn against them.

01:03:02.168 --> 01:03:04.337
They never called me a hero.

01:03:06.373 --> 01:03:07.742
Only you.

01:03:08.976 --> 01:03:11.045
I was just your faithful Mick.

01:03:16.949 --> 01:03:20.387
I was sorry they chose
to see it that way.

01:03:23.856 --> 01:03:26.825
We did things for them

01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.930
that cannot be forgiven.

01:03:30.396 --> 01:03:34.335
And for what,
when I come home to this?

01:03:38.672 --> 01:03:41.842
If I kill a man,
they call it murder.

01:03:42.976 --> 01:03:45.246
If they do it,
they call it war.

01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:48.215
Providence..

01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:51.085
...justice.

01:03:57.423 --> 01:03:59.726
Where will my family
get their justice..

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:04.699
...if not from me?

01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:15.940
Go home, English.

01:04:15.942 --> 01:04:18.045
You've got no business here.

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:25.251
I won't be leaving here
without you.

01:04:27.219 --> 01:04:29.122
Then you won't leave at all.

01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:27.311
What is all this?

01:05:27.313 --> 01:05:30.748
Kilmichael's put 50 guineas
on Feeney's head.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.583
Is every half-wit
in Ireland here?

01:05:32.585 --> 01:05:35.320
No, sir.
Your mother went home yesterday.

01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:38.759
Home to London.

01:06:16.496 --> 01:06:20.601
Your Lordship, Captain Pope
of the 68th regiment.

01:06:24.003 --> 01:06:28.338
Your Lordship, I'm Captain Pope.
I was sent here...

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.409
His Lordship knows full well
who you are, captain.

01:06:31.411 --> 01:06:33.344
What he does not know
is whether this report

01:06:33.346 --> 01:06:35.847
you've been compiling
will detail how you endangered

01:06:35.849 --> 01:06:39.950
his life withholding
vital information as you did.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:44.789
Sir, you are in grave danger.

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:46.990
We've managed this estate
for 200 years.

01:06:46.992 --> 01:06:47.992
Do you think
this is the first time

01:06:47.994 --> 01:06:49.459
our lives have been threatened?

01:06:49.461 --> 01:06:51.398
This is different.

01:06:53.099 --> 01:06:56.266
I have no intention of allowing
some turncoat renegade ranger

01:06:56.268 --> 01:06:57.802
to dictate my itinerary.

01:06:57.804 --> 01:07:00.070
I have a dozen men
to protect Lord Kilmichael.

01:07:00.072 --> 01:07:03.641
Poorly trained police
are no match for this soldier.

01:07:03.643 --> 01:07:06.010
Another two dozen local militia.

01:07:06.012 --> 01:07:07.748
And who do they fight for?

01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:13.918
They fight for the bounty
I've put on this ranger's head.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.820
We'll proceed as planned.

01:07:16.822 --> 01:07:18.188
I'll accompany the grain
to town

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.023
and from there,
take the train to Dublin.

01:07:20.025 --> 01:07:21.394
You may join me if you wish.

01:07:29.969 --> 01:07:31.137
Excuse me.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.474
Sorry, pardon me.
Excuse me.

01:07:37.476 --> 01:07:40.446
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:07:41.847 --> 01:07:44.014
What's goin' on, mate?

01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:47.150
Just scavengers,
they go after the wagons.

01:07:47.152 --> 01:07:48.952
Hopin' for a bit of grain.

01:07:48.954 --> 01:07:50.354
Oh, where are they
taking the grain?

01:07:50.356 --> 01:07:51.923
People are starving here.

01:07:51.925 --> 01:07:53.294
Boat to England.

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:14.545
I think we are headed back
to town, Mr. Conneely.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:15.713
Thanks for your help.

01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:17.514
The captain will pay you
what you're owed.

01:08:17.515 --> 01:08:20.817
If it is all the same to
yourself, Your Honor.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.687
I'd rather see it out.

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:24.688
Why settle for a sovereign
when there's a share

01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:26.089
of 50 guineas to be had.

01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:28.725
I beg your pardon, captain,
but after all this trouble

01:08:28.728 --> 01:08:33.163
I'd like to witness this
tale's conclusion first-hand

01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:36.233
that it might be accurately
retold in the future.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.112
You better come quick!

01:08:48.782 --> 01:08:52.215
- <i>Drop your weapon!</i>
- Open the gates.

01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:53.651
I'm not gonna tell you again.

01:08:53.653 --> 01:08:56.286
Drop your weapon,
or you will be shot.

01:08:56.287 --> 01:08:58.689
Hobson, what the hell
are you doing?

01:08:58.692 --> 01:09:00.657
I can't have it, sir.

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:02.559
Look at all those people, look.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.627
They're fuckin' starvin'.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:05.196
<i>Put down your gun!</i>

01:09:05.198 --> 01:09:07.031
This is your last warning.

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:08.665
Everyone's dyin' of hunger

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.701
and they're porting food
on a boat.

01:09:10.703 --> 01:09:12.169
Open the gates now.

01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.439
Private, lower your weapon.

01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:17.474
<i>Not till we feed these people.</i>

01:09:17.475 --> 01:09:18.910
Court martial me, sir.

01:09:18.912 --> 01:09:20.377
Do whatever you want with me

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.647
but not till those people
are fed.

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:24.182
Please, son, put down the gun.

01:09:24.184 --> 01:09:26.718
And I don't give a damn what you
think about either, Mr. Hannah.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.819
This is pointless,
it won't change anything.

01:09:28.822 --> 01:09:31.923
It will.
I can help these people.

01:09:53.046 --> 01:09:55.382
Sorry about your man, sergeant.

01:09:57.917 --> 01:10:00.550
I was talking to him!

01:10:00.552 --> 01:10:02.754
The boy lost his mind.

01:10:02.756 --> 01:10:04.254
You couldn't keep him
in check

01:10:04.256 --> 01:10:06.025
so Sergeant Fitzgibbon did.

01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:11.195
He was a danger to us all.

01:10:11.197 --> 01:10:13.434
He shot an unarmed constable.

01:10:16.336 --> 01:10:18.972
I only followed
His Lordship's orders.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.876
That seems accurate.

01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:01.141
Well, then, captain,
any sign of our assassin?

01:12:03.676 --> 01:12:05.375
If not,
does this mean I wonder

01:12:05.377 --> 01:12:08.215
that you've lost your man and
that your mission is a failure?

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.388
When I inherited
this estate from my father

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:20.223
it was practically bankrupt.

01:12:20.225 --> 01:12:22.261
To clear the land
was the only solution.

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:27.565
<i>Consolidate the holdings,
graze not grow</i>

01:12:27.567 --> 01:12:30.268
reduce this ridiculous tax

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:32.803
that I must pay per occupant.

01:12:32.805 --> 01:12:35.576
I don't need them, I don't want
them, why should I pay for them?

01:12:38.677 --> 01:12:42.648
This potato business is
simplified matters considerably.

01:12:48.387 --> 01:12:51.054
There are those who look forward
to the day

01:12:51.056 --> 01:12:52.857
when a Celtic Irishman

01:12:52.859 --> 01:12:54.759
is as rare in Ireland

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:57.762
as a Red Indian in Manhattan.

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:02.603
I take no pleasure on it.

01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:09.906
Would you stop worrying, man?

01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:12.209
There's hardly a soldier alive
who could get close enough

01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:14.347
to get a shot through this gap.

01:13:15.582 --> 01:13:17.651
<i>Security is assured.</i>

01:14:00.259 --> 01:14:04.195
The farmer goes into the bath
and he sees the old squire

01:14:04.197 --> 01:14:06.429
straddling his eldest daughter.

01:14:06.431 --> 01:14:09.834
Well, he's furious
and he lets out a shout..

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:12.003
"For God sake, Mary!

01:14:12.005 --> 01:14:13.903
"Arch your back like a good gal

01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:16.507
and keep the gentleman's balls
out of the muck."

01:14:30.256 --> 01:14:31.656
<i>Everything's in, My Lord.</i>

01:14:31.658 --> 01:14:33.891
We'll lock up the exits,
and I'll see you in the morning.

01:14:33.893 --> 01:14:35.862
Thank you, sergeant.

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:40.367
You know, Conneely..

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:43.936
...I love this country.

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.707
What's left of it?

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.208
The scenery.

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:54.114
You peasants are all the same,
no appreciation of beauty.

01:14:56.349 --> 01:14:59.250
Beauty would be held
in much higher regard, sir

01:14:59.252 --> 01:15:01.488
if it could be eaten.

01:15:02.988 --> 01:15:04.223
Well said.

01:15:05.957 --> 01:15:07.558
I say one more, shall we?

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.296
That we shall, sir.

01:15:12.398 --> 01:15:14.598
Speaking of beauty

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.468
this one could
almost be English.

01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:19.102
- Uh..
- Hair!

01:15:19.104 --> 01:15:21.638
Her skin, fine bosom

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.374
certainly head
and shoulders above

01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:27.146
any of the miserable hags
on the estate.

01:15:32.752 --> 01:15:35.555
Take the prettiest
English maiden..

01:15:37.289 --> 01:15:40.523
...put her for one season
in an Irish cabin..

01:15:40.525 --> 01:15:42.460
Yes?

01:15:42.462 --> 01:15:46.129
Feed her water and potato,
dress her in rags

01:15:46.131 --> 01:15:48.965
and make her wade through bogs

01:15:48.967 --> 01:15:51.134
and sleep with the family pig.

01:15:51.136 --> 01:15:54.205
Take from her any hope

01:15:54.207 --> 01:15:56.741
that the future
will be different

01:15:56.743 --> 01:16:00.410
and when she crawls
out of her hovel

01:16:00.412 --> 01:16:03.015
stretching out her scrawny hand
for a penny..

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:07.351
...how much will she look like

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:09.588
that pretty English maiden?

01:16:30.342 --> 01:16:33.210
One might be inclined
to speculate

01:16:33.212 --> 01:16:36.583
that you've lost your passion
for this mission, inspector.

01:16:39.018 --> 01:16:40.619
Hmm.

01:16:43.756 --> 01:16:46.860
I still have a few ideas about
how to apprehend Feeney..

01:16:49.028 --> 01:16:51.030
...but I need to know
you're with me.

01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:56.403
Yeah.

01:17:03.275 --> 01:17:04.708
Time to turn in.

01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:35.098
I got you, you bastard.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.433
Aah!

01:18:36.435 --> 01:18:37.771
<i>Hey!</i>

01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:50.283
Well done, Hannah.

01:18:55.087 --> 01:18:56.586
Let him have it.

01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:02.662
Shoot him, inspector.

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:21.611
Aah! Get your hands off of me!

01:19:35.661 --> 01:19:37.894
Shoot the bastard!

01:19:37.896 --> 01:19:39.466
Aah!

01:19:43.002 --> 01:19:44.237
Shite.

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:58.018
Do you intend to try to teach me
some sort of lesson?

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:03.189
Or to torture me?

01:20:08.527 --> 01:20:12.064
I assure you I'll give you
no satisfaction.

01:20:18.738 --> 01:20:20.606
I won't beg.

01:20:27.979 --> 01:20:29.615
What do you say?

01:20:32.385 --> 01:20:34.718
I don't understand
that aboriginal nonsense.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.489
Speak English, man!

01:20:42.328 --> 01:20:44.564
Speak English!

01:21:09.688 --> 01:21:11.554
I'll rip your goddamn
throat off.

01:21:13.626 --> 01:21:15.125
Who is he working with?

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.607
Don't bother threatening him,
sergeant.

01:21:34.947 --> 01:21:39.049
Mr. Hannah doesn't have
anything left to lose.

01:21:39.051 --> 01:21:41.888
<i>Now that he's committed
a treasonous act.</i>

01:21:46.324 --> 01:21:48.560
How long have you been
working together?

01:21:51.262 --> 01:21:52.361
<i>Since the beginning?</i>

01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:07.981
Where is he now?

01:22:13.185 --> 01:22:14.654
Shall I get the whip?

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:22.761
He won't talk.

01:22:38.344 --> 01:22:41.044
He's out there somewhere,
and we have to find him quickly.

01:22:41.046 --> 01:22:43.080
Each of you, take four men
from outside the gates.

01:22:43.082 --> 01:22:45.048
Search the area.

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:46.186
Run!

01:23:57.155 --> 01:23:59.826
Make ready!

01:24:02.127 --> 01:24:04.561
Present!

01:24:16.207 --> 01:24:17.574
Take cover!

01:24:17.576 --> 01:24:19.011
Ahh!

01:24:29.054 --> 01:24:31.021
Sergeant!

01:24:31.023 --> 01:24:32.822
Who's firing on you?

01:24:32.824 --> 01:24:34.825
The man on the roof
in the west, sir!

01:24:34.827 --> 01:24:36.262
You men, with me.

01:24:36.895 --> 01:24:38.097
<i>Hey!</i>

01:24:38.863 --> 01:24:40.998
<i>It's Feeney.</i>

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.566
It's Feeney!

01:24:45.871 --> 01:24:47.437
Open fire!

01:25:03.322 --> 01:25:05.921
Who gets the 50 guineas?

01:25:05.923 --> 01:25:07.691
Hold those men back!

01:25:33.418 --> 01:25:35.085
- Close those gates.
- Close the gate!

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:36.253
Reload your weapons.

01:25:36.255 --> 01:25:39.289
Where is Mr. Hannah?
Secure the prisoner.

01:27:00.005 --> 01:27:00.972
He's here!

01:30:29.847 --> 01:30:30.983
Hey, ho-ho.

01:30:54.472 --> 01:30:56.074
They'll come for you now.

01:31:01.479 --> 01:31:02.414
Yeah.

01:31:08.353 --> 01:31:10.186
Don't fight them.

01:31:16.828 --> 01:31:18.497
Go to America.
