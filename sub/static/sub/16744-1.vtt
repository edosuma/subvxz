WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:19.553
(Hands clapping)

00:23.757 --> 00:25.293
* Oh, you
* You

00:25.326 --> 00:27.461
* With those tongue
and lips

00:27.495 --> 00:29.197
* Let me taste

00:29.230 --> 00:30.931
* Your bitter kiss

00:30.964 --> 00:32.966
* Oh, you
* You

00:33.000 --> 00:35.069
* With those seasoned eyes

00:35.103 --> 00:36.904
* Let me walk

00:36.937 --> 00:38.606
* Inside your smile

00:38.639 --> 00:42.443
* All my nerves
are tearing me down

00:42.476 --> 00:46.480
* Won't you just come over here
and take away this frown

00:46.514 --> 00:48.382
* 'Cause I can't sleep
* Tight

00:48.416 --> 00:50.351
* I don't see
* Right

00:50.384 --> 00:52.253
* I won't feel
* Right

00:52.286 --> 00:54.222
* Until you're mine
* Mine

00:54.255 --> 00:56.090
* I can't sleep
* Tight

00:56.124 --> 00:58.058
* I don't see
* Right

00:58.092 --> 00:59.827
* I won't feel
* Right

00:59.860 --> 01:01.895
* Until you're mine
* Mine

01:01.929 --> 01:03.497
* Oh, you
* You

01:03.531 --> 01:05.733
* Just walk away
* Walk away

01:05.766 --> 01:09.803
* Before I break down
and cave

01:09.837 --> 01:11.205
* Oh, you
* You

01:11.239 --> 01:13.241
* It's just not fair

01:13.274 --> 01:17.211
* How you kill me
with just one stare

01:17.245 --> 01:20.781
* All my nerves
are tearing me down

01:20.814 --> 01:24.718
* Won't you just come over here
and lick away this frown

01:24.752 --> 01:26.887
* 'Cause I can't sleep
* Tight

01:26.920 --> 01:28.856
* I don't see
* Right

01:28.889 --> 01:30.391
* I won't feel
* Right

01:30.424 --> 01:32.460
* Until you're mine
* Mine

01:32.493 --> 01:34.495
* I can't sleep
* Tight

01:34.528 --> 01:36.397
* I don't see
* Right

01:36.430 --> 01:38.166
* I won't feel
* Right

01:38.199 --> 01:40.334
* Until you're mine
* Mine

01:40.368 --> 01:42.270
* Can't sleep tight

01:42.303 --> 01:44.071
* Don't see right

01:44.104 --> 01:46.006
* Won't feel fine

01:46.039 --> 01:47.741
* Until you're mine

01:47.775 --> 01:49.810
* Can't sleep tight
* Can't sleep tight

01:49.843 --> 01:52.079
* Don't see right
* Don't see right

01:52.112 --> 01:53.881
* Won't feel fine
* Won't feel fine

01:53.914 --> 01:55.816
* Until you're mine
* Until you're mine

01:55.849 --> 01:57.685
* Can't sleep tight
* Can't sleep tight

01:57.718 --> 01:59.553
* Don't see right
* Don't see right

01:59.587 --> 02:01.555
* Won't feel fine
* Won't feel fine

02:01.589 --> 02:03.424
* Until you're mine
* Until you're mine

02:03.457 --> 02:05.259
* Can't sleep tight

02:05.293 --> 02:07.295
* Don't see right
* Be mine, baby

02:07.328 --> 02:09.062
* Won't feel fine
* Be mine, baby

02:09.096 --> 02:10.798
* Until you're mine

02:10.830 --> 02:12.866
* Until you're mine
* Can't sleep tight

02:12.900 --> 02:14.735
* Don't see right

02:14.768 --> 02:16.304
* Until you're mine

02:17.871 --> 02:20.107
KATIE, NARRATING:
When I decided
at the last minute

02:20.140 --> 02:21.642
to take a year off
before college,

02:21.675 --> 02:24.412
I told my mom it was
because I had no idea

02:24.445 --> 02:26.314
what I wanted to do
with my life.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.617
She pretended she didn't want
to strangle me.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.621
But sweetie, that's the whole
point of college:

02:33.654 --> 02:35.789
is to figure out
what you want to do,

02:35.823 --> 02:38.826
to find out what you're good at,
to discover your bliss.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.128
But what if I don't discover it
until junior year,

02:41.161 --> 02:44.131
and it has nothing to do with
the classes I've already taken?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.833
I'd have to start over.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.469
Or what if my bliss is something
I don't even need college for?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.238
(Typing)

02:55.108 --> 02:57.745
WOMAN:
I'm not going to lie to you,
Katie. I'm concerned.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.214
Why? Tons of kids defer.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.350
You're not tons of kids.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.319
You're one complicated girl
who's been through a lot.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.854
You need structure.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.223
Are you saying that college
is the only place

03:09.257 --> 03:10.824
that I can get structure?

03:10.858 --> 03:13.261
Because if so,
Miss Matsuo...

03:13.294 --> 03:15.128
Katie.
I'm serious.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.930
Here's something.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.532
Why don't you start a diary.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.102
Or a blog?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.371
Why?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.706
It's a daily
time commitment.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.609
It'll keep your
verbal skills sharp.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.978
And it'll force you
to be introspective.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.349
What a wonderful idea.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.290
I was just lying
to escape her vegan breath.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.432
At least that's what I thought
at the time.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.134
But I guess not.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.236
What the fuck?

03:56.270 --> 03:58.739
Here I am blogging.

03:58.772 --> 04:03.411
Anyway, I'm going to start
by telling you a secret,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.546
something I've never
told anyone.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.149
The real reason I'm taking
a year off is because of a guy,

04:09.182 --> 04:11.151
an older one.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.453
A man.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.888
And he's the most amazing...

04:14.922 --> 04:17.156
Shit, got to go.

04:17.190 --> 04:27.335
*

04:30.304 --> 04:33.006
* You don't know
what I'm gonna do

04:33.040 --> 04:35.275
* Or what I see in you

04:35.309 --> 04:37.144
* You're obsessed

04:37.177 --> 04:38.812
* With my little red dress

04:39.880 --> 04:41.582
Boo!
(Children screaming)

04:41.615 --> 04:44.184
* But you don't care
if I'm a mess, now do you?

04:44.217 --> 04:45.586
Boo!

04:45.619 --> 04:47.321
* Do you?

04:48.188 --> 04:50.391
* Do you?

04:51.759 --> 04:54.027
* Do you?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.101
Boo!

05:01.134 --> 05:02.636
You're late.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.137
You noticed.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.475
Dan and I have one
strict rule:

05:07.508 --> 05:10.077
we don't talk
about his girlfriend...

05:10.110 --> 05:12.413
or my boyfriend.

05:12.446 --> 05:17.117
Dan teaches film at a really
good community college,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.687
so we only watch
serious cinema.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.322
(Man shouting in German on TV)

05:22.356 --> 05:24.658
I feel smarter
just being around him.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.332
One of the best things
about my year off

05:32.366 --> 05:35.335
is that I get to continue
my education.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.756
(Both breathing heavily)

05:59.493 --> 06:02.062
He never asks
for anything in return.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.134
He just wants me to relax
and enjoy it.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.139
(Birds tweeting)

06:15.709 --> 06:18.378
(Children speaking indistinctly)

06:18.412 --> 06:20.748
(Children laughing)

06:20.781 --> 06:22.516
(Crow cawing)

06:27.488 --> 06:29.022
GIRL:
Dad?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.092
(Shuddering)

06:35.328 --> 06:37.130
(Both panting)

06:40.367 --> 06:42.169
You always hold back
in the end.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.171
(Laughing):
I'm sorry.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.305
(Chuckling)

06:45.338 --> 06:46.774
It's your loss.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.915
(Exhaling)

07:01.421 --> 07:05.192
Have, uh-- I got some news.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.428
I'm, uh, moving closer
to campus.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.832
Why?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.702
Look at this dump.
It's ridiculous.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.204
Looks like I'm still
in grad school.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.607
Well, did you already
find a place?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.575
Yeah. It's great.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.343
And they'll let me move in
on the 15th

07:23.376 --> 07:25.212
(Exhaling)
Well, where is it?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.648
It's like a half-hour away.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.554
We're not going
to see each other again.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.255
Of course we will.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.157
Come on, don't be so
melodramatic.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.359
No, you're not going to want
to come pick me up

07:39.392 --> 07:40.728
and then drive me
to your place,

07:40.761 --> 07:42.362
and then back to mine
a few hours later.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.833
That's like two hours
in the car.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.400
(Sighing):
And someone might see us.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.469
Come on, you know
I'm right.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.004
(Sighing)

07:51.038 --> 07:53.574
If my dad would just
buy me that car he promised me,

07:53.607 --> 07:55.142
then I could--
I could come see you--

07:55.175 --> 07:57.611
Listen, listen,
listen, listen.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.379
We're going
to work it out, okay?

07:59.412 --> 08:02.583
We'll work it out.
I promise you.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.087
Come on.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.476
(Breathing heavily)

08:29.509 --> 08:31.779
(Zipper rasping)

08:31.812 --> 08:33.246
Shit.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.150
(Gasping)

08:42.089 --> 08:44.692
I'd never
touched him before.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.727
I was always too scared.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.097
He came so hard.

08:51.665 --> 08:55.535
He'll definitely call me
after he moves.

08:55.569 --> 08:59.306
CAROLINE:
So don't you think it's time
to stop loafing and get a job?

08:59.339 --> 09:02.342
I'm not loafing,
I'm blogging.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.277
CAROLINE:
Since when?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.646
Last week.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.414
CAROLINE:
What's your blog called?

09:07.447 --> 09:08.916
KATIE:
Not telling.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.718
And you won't find out,
because I use a fake name

09:10.751 --> 09:13.553
and I'm changing lots
of little details of my life.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.189
Why?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.858
Because if there was even
a one in googol chance

09:17.891 --> 09:19.326
of anyone figuring out
it was me,

09:19.359 --> 09:20.794
then I wouldn't
tell the truth.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.262
And what's the point
of having a blog

09:22.295 --> 09:24.297
if you're just going to lie?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.532
(Door opening)

09:25.565 --> 09:26.900
Hey, babe.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.137
Why do you
call her that?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.339
She's 46.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.907
(Sighing)

09:35.508 --> 09:39.379
What is on the agenda
for today, hmm?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.115
TV? Internet?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.684
Maybe a good, long nap?

09:43.717 --> 09:46.353
I'm getting a job.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.021
The grill or the fryer?

09:48.055 --> 09:49.890
Ha-ha.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.091
Neither.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.027
Something stimulating
that pays extremely well.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.798
MAN:
This may come
as a shock to you, kiddo,

09:57.831 --> 10:00.167
but the economy
is in the toilet.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.805
There's 20 applicants
for every job.

10:04.838 --> 10:08.375
You underestimate
my powers, Earthling.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.080
Today, a reader sent me one
of those annoying self quizzes,

10:13.113 --> 10:16.950
which are just a sad excuse
to talk about yourself.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.821
What's your
favourite number?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.389
69.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.324
Sometimes 96.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.394
Have you ever kissed someone
and regretted it?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.462
Yes. Tom Lovelace,

10:29.496 --> 10:32.465
who was 16 when I was 11.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.668
My fist tongue kiss.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.270
It felt like a worm.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.540
* I want it all to end

10:40.573 --> 10:43.343
* Being loved by you

10:45.512 --> 10:48.281
* Hold me now

10:48.315 --> 10:49.950
* Make it stop

10:49.983 --> 10:54.554
* The butterflies
won't go away

10:54.587 --> 10:56.957
Do you believe
in the horoscope?

10:56.990 --> 11:00.761
No. Sagittarians never do.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.830
* I am lost

11:02.863 --> 11:05.365
* Make me found

11:05.398 --> 11:06.834
Stop right there!

11:06.867 --> 11:09.369
Don't even put it up.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.404
Have I got
the girl for you?

11:13.406 --> 11:15.075
Is that so?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.016
Come in.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.822
What happened
to Jonas?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.858
I bought him out,
lock stock and barrel.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.693
You have so many
more books.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.062
I used to buy my dad

11:35.095 --> 11:36.730
his birthday and
Christmas presents here.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.031
He's a sports writer.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.568
Well, he used to be.
Now he just drinks.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.136
(Chuckling)

11:46.740 --> 11:50.010
Sam Johnson's Book Shop.
Nice to meet you, Sam.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.380
No, I'm not Sam.
He died a long time ago.

11:53.413 --> 11:58.185
Dr. Samuel Johnson wrote the
first great English dictionary.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.552
Is he your hero?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.121
Among many.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.491
Are you a lover of books?

12:04.524 --> 12:05.759
I could be.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.329
Glenn Warburg.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.098
Katie Kampenfelt.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.201
Three days a week,
$12 an hour.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
Wow!

12:15.435 --> 12:16.636
And it's butt-easy.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.005
All I have to do
is help customers

12:18.038 --> 12:19.706
while Glenn runs
the online business.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.610
Sweetie, I got to hand it
to you, that was fast.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.145
You did it.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.514
KATIE:
Yup, I am indeed impressive.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.649
Does Glenn have
a last name?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.251
Warburg.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.853
Is he married?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.022
Why? You think
he only hired me

12:35.055 --> 12:37.457
so he could have
sexual intercourse with me?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.392
It crossed my mind.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.463
Your moustache
is heinous.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.608
I've only been blogging
for 16 days,

12:55.642 --> 13:00.814
but I already get between 450
and 500 discreet visitors a
day.

13:00.848 --> 13:04.584
The most popular search terms
that people use to find me

13:04.617 --> 13:06.586
are "high school,"
"college,"

13:06.619 --> 13:10.490
"blond," "sex,"
and "oral sex,"

13:10.523 --> 13:15.062
which means many of you
are lonely, disgusting pigs.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.032
I also know a lot of you
are just normal people

13:19.066 --> 13:21.568
who want to read the true-life
confessions of a tee--

13:21.601 --> 13:23.703
(Knocking at door)
What?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.038
It's me.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.039
Come in.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.540
Boyfriend invasion.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.576
Stand by.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.344
I thought you had
band practice.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.745
Casey had a midterm.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.447
(Gasping)

13:36.683 --> 13:38.986
MAN 1, OVER TV:
You know, Wong, I don't know
which is worse.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.488
Watching you eat
or watching you at work.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.824
MAN 2:
I'm perfectly able to do
anything I want...

13:44.858 --> 13:47.995
KATIE, NARRATING:
None of you care
that I cheat on Rory,

13:48.028 --> 13:50.998
but for some reason you hate
that it's with an older guy

13:51.031 --> 13:52.900
who has a girlfriend.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.003
Well, I had no clue
about Martina

13:56.036 --> 13:58.371
until after the third time
Dan and I fooled around,

13:58.405 --> 14:01.474
and I found her birth control
in a bathroom drawer.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.278
By then it was too late.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.546
(Laughing)

14:06.579 --> 14:08.281
I was in it.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.262
(Breathing heavily)

14:31.671 --> 14:32.906
(Grunting)

14:32.940 --> 14:34.341
Hold on...

14:35.542 --> 14:36.809
Oh, God.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.345
(Panting)

14:41.648 --> 14:43.216
Oh, wow,
you're so hot.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.420
Oh, God, I love you.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.356
Oh, God. Oh!

14:49.389 --> 14:51.391
Oh, God-- Ah!

14:51.424 --> 14:52.725
Oh!

14:52.759 --> 14:55.195
(Both panting)

14:58.932 --> 15:00.400
I think I just came.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.035
(Both laughing)

15:04.637 --> 15:06.139
Was I supposed
to pull out?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
Six o'clock.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.211
Hey, so it is.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.983
$288 cash with a two-dollar bill
for good luck.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.651
Good first week?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.420
Amazing.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.889
And I almost finished Who Has
Changed and Who Is Dead.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.591
Thank you
for the recommendation.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.359
You're very welcome.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.161
You know, it's the first book
I've read since second grade

15:28.195 --> 15:31.031
that was-- You know, like,
wasn't for school.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.566
Yeah, that's the way it is
these days, I guess.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.734
So sad.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.169
I know.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.938
I can't imagine life
without great books.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.709
It's as close to the angels
as I get.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.444
What do you mean?

15:44.477 --> 15:48.982
Well, for me, reading
is a transcendent experience.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.519
Hmm.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.756
What does that mean,
exactly?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.758
What, "transcendence"?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.095
It means beyond
the physical realm.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.464
It's a spiritual
experience.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.167
I get it from great literature,
great paintings,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.769
classical music,
all the arts.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.039
What about
classical art films,

16:12.072 --> 16:14.607
like Fellini or BuÃ±uel?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.509
Sure.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.179
Cool.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.182
* I knew it from the start

16:22.215 --> 16:25.752
* You would break my heart

16:25.785 --> 16:30.290
* But I fell for you

16:30.323 --> 16:33.660
* No matter how hard
I try

16:33.693 --> 16:38.031
* Change what's inside

16:38.065 --> 16:39.866
* You are all I need

16:39.899 --> 16:42.435
Dan didn't even call
to say goodbye.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.705
* You're the fire
in my heart

16:45.738 --> 16:50.043
If I don't get a car now,
I'll never see him again.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.711
(Indistinct chattering over TV)

17:00.420 --> 17:03.390
Look at the size
of that blue-gummed dummy.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.066
(Turns TV off)

17:13.099 --> 17:15.468
So, what's up?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.171
Well, it's been really,
really hard

17:18.204 --> 17:21.040
ever since all my friends left
to go to college.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.442
And I just--

17:22.474 --> 17:24.042
I've been sitting at home
all the time.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.545
I have no ride.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.814
I can't get anywhere.
And I'm just--

17:27.847 --> 17:29.249
Tell the witch
to buy you a car.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.550
No, she won't do it.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.352
She thinks I'm so much
like you,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.020
she thinks I'm just going
to drink a bunch of beers

17:34.053 --> 17:35.188
and hit a tree.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.524
Sanctimonious cunt.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.493
If she had her way
we'd all be drinking holy water.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.895
Out of the pope's
jockstrap.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.564
Did you come up with that?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.699
No, you did.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.568
No wonder.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.137
(Chuckling)

17:50.170 --> 17:53.173
What about peckerhead?
Why can't he squire you around?

17:53.206 --> 17:56.976
Well, because we broke up
last night.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.478
How come?

18:00.313 --> 18:03.616
He's been pressuring me to,
you know,

18:03.650 --> 18:04.984
like, go all the way,

18:05.017 --> 18:07.787
and I'm just
not ready yet.

18:09.922 --> 18:14.227
Shit. Must have done
something right.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.971
Daddy...

18:25.004 --> 18:28.141
my whole life,
you said you would buy me a car

18:28.175 --> 18:30.277
when I graduated.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.147
Please keep
your promise.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.883
Please, Daddy,
just this once.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.451
Please.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.389
And you promised me you'd stay
my little angel forever.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.457
You'd never grow up.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.430
Now look at you.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.466
Tits and everything.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.508
(Cell phone vibrating)

19:05.178 --> 19:07.747
MAN, OVER PHONE:
Hey, uh, Joel Seidler here.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.417
I'm not sure
if you remember me.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.786
I'm tall and muscular,
and I played football.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.489
No, wait,
that's my diametric opposite.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.726
I'm the short, depressed Jew
who tutored you in math.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.895
Anyway, I'm a senior
at Princeton now,

19:22.929 --> 19:24.697
and I'm taking
a semester off.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.835
I heard that you were around.
Call me or text me, whatever.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.906
GIRL, OVER PHONE:
I'm back, bitch!

19:33.940 --> 19:35.275
(Laughing)

19:37.777 --> 19:39.412
KATIE, NARRATING:
Thank God Jade's home

19:39.446 --> 19:41.281
from visiting her grandmother
in Greece.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.584
Jade's pretty much
my only female friend now.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.788
There was a rumour last year
that Jade and I were dykes.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.390
I have no idea why.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.825
I want your tits!
I want your ass!

19:52.859 --> 19:54.527
I want your skin!

19:54.561 --> 19:55.762
I want your ass!

19:55.795 --> 19:57.196
I want your ass!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.732
* I'm finding it true

19:59.766 --> 20:02.269
* When I'm hanging
around you

20:02.302 --> 20:05.738
* I think it's easy
to say

20:07.139 --> 20:09.242
* My boyfriend
is in junior high

20:09.276 --> 20:11.711
* His real age is just
one big lie

20:11.744 --> 20:13.646
* I wish I would have
known that...

20:13.680 --> 20:15.548
JADE:
If he lived here, let's face it.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.485
We'd end up hating
each other's guts.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.888
This way it stays
perfect forever.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.759
KATIE:
You fall in love every time
you go on vacation.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.960
(Jade laughing)

20:27.994 --> 20:29.262
(Inhaling deeply)

20:29.296 --> 20:31.998
I know. I'm a rock star.
(Laughing)

20:32.031 --> 20:34.934
I met him like
my second day in Corfu.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.003
I told you
Dan moved away, right?

20:37.036 --> 20:38.538
Yeah.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.508
He hasn't called me since.
It's humiliating.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.313
You didn't fool around
with him, did you?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.147
(Laughing):
No! Hello!

20:48.180 --> 20:51.017
He's 32 and he has
a girlfriend.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.654
And you have
fucking Rory.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.323
* Lick my lips

20:56.356 --> 20:58.224
* I'm mouthwatering

20:58.257 --> 20:59.959
* Take a sip

21:01.928 --> 21:03.696
* Pretty please

21:03.730 --> 21:05.365
* I'm begging
for some honey

21:05.398 --> 21:07.500
* Indulge me

21:09.001 --> 21:10.770
* Baby, got me going
'Cause you looking so--

21:13.340 --> 21:15.975
KATIE, NARRATING:
I can't believe you're all
really out there.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.912
I'm used to only being famous
in my own mind.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.448
(Pop music playing)

21:24.817 --> 21:26.052
What are you doing?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.388
Oh, nothing.
Just wasting time.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.423
(Knocking at door)

21:31.691 --> 21:32.992
Come with me.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.260
What's wrong?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.662
Just come. Not you.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.730
And put some clothes on.
We have neighbours.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.298
(Gasping)

21:43.470 --> 21:45.938
Dad's dead, isn't he?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.485
MAN:
Bad news, hon.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.587
Your starting salary just didn't
past the smell test with me,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.723
so I had a friend of mine in
law enforcement do some digging.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.394
Is this your boss?

22:13.866 --> 22:15.368
Glenn's a rapist?

22:15.402 --> 22:18.004
Sexual assault's
a much broader category.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.906
The particulars can vary,

22:19.939 --> 22:24.511
but, yeah, it's basically
sexual contact without consent.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.548
You have to quit your job
right away.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.717
What am I
supposed to say?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.822
Hmm. Start with this.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.359
My mom's boyfriend has a partner
at a really big law firm.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.328
She thinks it'll look impressive
on my rÃ©sumÃ©

22:42.361 --> 22:45.965
if I ever want to be
an attorney, which I might.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.968
So I really have to quit.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.270
GLENN, OVER PHONE:
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

22:51.303 --> 22:55.141
So am I, really.

22:55.174 --> 22:58.645
You're a very special girl,
Katie, and a joy to be around.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.179
And I'll miss you.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.549
Thanks. You too.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.585
Bye, Glenn.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.626
Do you have
some clean underwear?

23:32.378 --> 23:33.980
(Cell phone vibrating)

23:34.013 --> 23:38.217
Please be Dan.
Please, please, please be Dan.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.919
Please be Dan.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.690
Hello?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.257
MAN, OVER PHONE:
Catherine?

23:45.291 --> 23:47.326
Katie, actually.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.395
I don't know
if you remember me.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.897
My name's Paul Spooner.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.633
I interviewed you
for admittance to Tufts.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.937
Oh, no, of course
I remember you.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.539
Hello, Paul.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.675
Oh, you know, I got in.
I just decided to defer a year.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.512
I know. That's actually
why I'm calling.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.447
You don't by any chance
need a job, do you?

24:08.481 --> 24:12.652
That is so, so weird.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.420
I had one until, like,
10 days ago,

24:14.453 --> 24:15.888
but then I had to quit.

24:15.922 --> 24:19.358
My boss turned out to be
a convicted sex offender.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.060
That's terrible.

24:21.093 --> 24:25.665
Well, even more terrible for
the gal he sexually offended.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.801
(Laughing):
Yeah.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.169
(Chuckling)

24:31.337 --> 24:33.706
I got a new job!

24:33.740 --> 24:36.208
Hey, can I
call you back?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.376
That's wonderful.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.911
What is it?
I'm a nanny.

24:38.945 --> 24:45.051
I get paid $12 an hour,
and I get the use of a car.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.452
A car! I get a Volvo!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.187
I'm getting a Volvo!

24:48.220 --> 24:49.355
What?

24:49.388 --> 24:51.357
What's with the face?

24:51.390 --> 24:53.526
Well, did you tell him
you have no experience?

24:53.560 --> 24:55.094
Of course not.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.462
Honey.
What?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.830
What? What?!

24:57.864 --> 25:01.133
Why are you
so fucking negative?!

25:01.167 --> 25:11.110
*

25:21.588 --> 25:23.556
Catherine.
Katie.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.525
Oh, my God,
you are so cute and tiny.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.695
Come in.
I'm Margaret Spooner.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.530
It is a pleasure
to meet you.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.232
You are a godsend.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.667
Oh, cool.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.203
You have no idea.
I'll show you around.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.605
This house is amazing.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.007
Oh, thank you.
I'm an interior designer,

25:41.040 --> 25:42.875
so love it.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.244
You just missed Paul.
He works for a big hedge fund,

25:45.277 --> 25:48.981
so he travels all the time,
but he'll be back on Friday.

25:49.015 --> 25:53.219
So Paul said that you have
some experience with newborns.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.555
Oh, not much, but yeah.

25:56.589 --> 26:00.192
Well, I had zero
when Kyle was born.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.527
Okay, you smell that?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.229
That is newborn poop.

26:03.262 --> 26:08.801
Kind of like butter popcorn when
they're nursing, which Kyle is.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.336
Go ahead.
Your first lesson.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.138
Pick him up.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.339
Really?
Yeah.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.041
Just make sure
you cradle his head.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.913
That's it.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.884
You got it.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.118
(Sighing)

26:28.487 --> 26:30.056
Hi.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.159
He likes you.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.094
KATIE, NARRATING:
Stop being mad at me
for not posting.

26:35.127 --> 26:39.165
I had a very busy week learning
how to take care of a baby.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.234
(Typing)

26:56.983 --> 26:58.550
KATIE:
Hey!

26:58.584 --> 27:01.620
Hey, super nanny
Katherine Kampenfelt.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.889
(Laughing):
How was your flight?

27:02.922 --> 27:05.157
It was interminable.
Where's Maggie?

27:05.191 --> 27:06.625
Feeding Kyle.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.728
Come on,
let's get reacquainted.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.667
So tell me everything.
How was your first week?

27:14.701 --> 27:16.002
It was awesome.
Hmm.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.337
Margaret is such
a great teacher.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.072
Kyle is such a good baby.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.074
Way more mature
than my boyfriend.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.342
(Laughing)

27:23.375 --> 27:25.812
I can't tell you how relieved
I am this worked out.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.681
Remember how much fun we had
at our interview?

27:29.716 --> 27:32.218
Honestly,
not really.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.821
I thought Tufts
was just my safety school.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.289
Well, that explains
why you were so cocky.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.091
Hey.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.526
Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.628
Ow.
Oh, sorry.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.697
Your pay.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.199
Yeah, but it's only 3:15.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.736
Oh, um, okay.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.071
Well, I'll see you guys
Monday.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.141
MARGARET:
Remember when my ass
looked like that?

27:56.542 --> 27:58.110
Bye.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.448
KATIE, NARRATING:
Last night was the fifth
Friday in a row

28:02.481 --> 28:04.784
that Dan didn't call me.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.753
And since
I'm not allowed to call,

28:06.786 --> 28:08.955
text or even e-mail him,

28:08.988 --> 28:11.190
there's nothing I can do.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.297
My grandmother once told me,

28:18.330 --> 28:20.366
"Never make a big decision
while you're bleeding,

28:20.399 --> 28:22.969
because there's a pretty good
chance you're nuts."

28:23.002 --> 28:25.838
But I don't care.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.611
I'm tired of waiting.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.914
(Funky upbeat music playing)

29:01.373 --> 29:02.975
(Turning music off)

29:03.009 --> 29:04.376
Hi.
Hey.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.745
I have an evil scheme.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.247
My favourite kind.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.516
(Phone line ringing)

29:10.549 --> 29:13.185
Oh, God,
please answer the phone.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.788
I did not know
you were religious.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.556
Only when I'm jonesing
for a bonesing.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.225
WOMAN, OVER PHONE:
Hello?

29:19.258 --> 29:20.960
(Speaking Spanish)

29:25.231 --> 29:26.799
Wrong number.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.135
(Laughing):
Okay, what did you just say?

29:29.168 --> 29:30.903
"Where's the clog
that we ate yesterday

29:30.937 --> 29:34.273
at the beauty parlour
train station bathroom?"

29:34.306 --> 29:35.641
Genius.
Yeah.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.276
Okay, wrong numbers always
come in twos, right?

29:37.309 --> 29:38.677
Right.

29:38.710 --> 29:39.979
I have one more chance.
Maybe he'll answer.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.647
Why does he let her
answer the phone?

29:41.680 --> 29:43.916
She grabs it. She's this crazy,
jealous French bitch from hell.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.285
That's why I can't
contact him.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.686
(Phone line ringing)

29:47.719 --> 29:49.488
DAN, OVER PHONE:
Hello?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.557
Hey, it's me. Call me when you
get this. It's really important.

29:51.590 --> 29:52.724
Okay, bye. Aah!

29:52.758 --> 29:54.093
Got it!
(Laughing)

29:56.262 --> 29:57.563
(Sighing)
Okay.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.067
Want to watch some porn?

30:03.669 --> 30:05.571
Bye, Jadey.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.875
(Cell phone vibrating)

30:13.612 --> 30:15.047
(Sighing)

30:21.453 --> 30:23.155
(Cell phone vibrating)

30:26.192 --> 30:27.927
Please don't be mad at me.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.628
DAN:
I'm not.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.098
Martine just ran out
to buy cigarettes. What's up?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.471
I got a car.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.307
A Volvo.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.213
Hello?

30:48.780 --> 30:50.249
Yeah.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.120
I can come see you
whenever you want me to.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.066
Remember what I did
last time?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.237
How I touched you?

31:11.270 --> 31:12.939
(Sighing)

31:18.644 --> 31:21.047
I want to do it again.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.084
But this time with my mouth.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.221
Let me.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.924
Please.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.628
Wednesday, I'll text you
the address.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.769
KATIE, NARRATING:
Paul made a ton of money today

31:43.802 --> 31:46.205
because he predicted
a stock would tank.

31:46.238 --> 31:50.409
He brought home Belgium
chocolates and champagne.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.883
All day I was so excited
about my date with Dan

31:57.916 --> 32:00.619
my heart felt like
it was going to explode.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.989
I loved the whole world.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.125
* You're calling me
on my phone

32:06.158 --> 32:09.261
* It's 2:00 in the morning

32:12.764 --> 32:14.466
* Boy, you just
ain't the type

32:14.500 --> 32:16.435
* That a girl gonna hit
once or twice

32:16.468 --> 32:19.305
* (Unclear)

32:23.409 --> 32:25.711
DAN: We need protection.
KATIE: No. No, we don't.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.080
Are you sure?

32:42.261 --> 32:43.629
(Panting)

32:45.964 --> 32:48.400
(Children laughing)

32:50.902 --> 32:52.438
(Bird hooting)

33:00.412 --> 33:01.747
GIRL:
Daddy!

33:01.780 --> 33:03.182
(Sighing)

33:12.524 --> 33:14.993
Cigarettes?
Since when?

33:16.395 --> 33:17.729
Yeah.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.599
It was a mistake.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.568
Oh, come on.
One's not going to kill you.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.404
No, I meant that.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.307
Well, my period
just ended.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.077
That's not
what I meant.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.412
Is it my age?

33:33.445 --> 33:36.148
You know my birthday's
at midnight.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.656
Here's the thing.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.727
I care about you a lot,

33:48.760 --> 33:50.262
but--
Okay before you dump me,

33:50.296 --> 33:52.264
let me say something.

33:52.298 --> 33:55.401
Martine treats you
like shit

33:55.434 --> 33:57.035
and I think you should
dump her

33:57.069 --> 33:58.804
and go out
with me instead.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.472
Now I know my age
freaks you out,

34:00.506 --> 34:02.941
but we can do it
in a really cool, healthy way.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.576
I promise.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.545
I wouldn't have to meet
any of your friends,

34:06.578 --> 34:09.014
and I wouldn't make you
meet my mom.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.350
We could keep
the whole thing a secret.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.351
It would just be us
right here,

34:13.385 --> 34:16.088
making love
and watching art films.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.889
And then when I go away
to college,

34:18.924 --> 34:21.393
we break up
really maturely.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.397
Stay friends forever.
It's perfect.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.697
(Sighing)

34:26.732 --> 34:28.734
It would be.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.469
Is that a yes?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.841
I can't.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.779
Why?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.382
Martine and I
are engaged.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.485
Since the middle
of October.

34:51.690 --> 34:55.261
What do you have with her
that you don't have with me?

34:55.293 --> 34:56.828
(Sighing):
Katie...

34:56.862 --> 34:58.096
Answer the fucking question.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.298
There are just--

34:59.331 --> 35:01.032
There are things that--
That people

35:01.066 --> 35:02.868
close to each other in age
share.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.236
Like what?
Martine and I

35:04.270 --> 35:06.104
are intellectually
compatible.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.914
KATIE:
Why did you have to fuck me
before you told me the truth?

35:15.947 --> 35:18.217
You're such a liar!

35:27.926 --> 35:29.728
So is that why you moved?

35:31.029 --> 35:33.131
So you could
live together?

35:34.933 --> 35:36.335
She lives here?

35:57.055 --> 35:58.257
RORY:
Where were you?

35:58.290 --> 36:00.058
What happened
to your study group?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.927
It ended an hour ago.
Where were you?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.094
A movie!

36:03.128 --> 36:04.796
Is everything
all right?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.832
Have you been
crying?

36:09.335 --> 36:11.603
CAROLINE:
Rory, come down.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.971
What did you see?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.139
What?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.074
The name of the movie,
what was it?

36:16.107 --> 36:18.877
Sex With a Paranoid Guy.
It was a comedy.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.746
Now go home,
you freak.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.414
Where were you?

36:22.448 --> 36:23.815
Fuck you!

36:23.849 --> 36:25.484
(Grunting)

36:25.517 --> 36:26.952
CAROLINE:
Are you okay?

36:26.985 --> 36:28.153
He was older.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.621
He's a 32-year-old guy,

36:29.655 --> 36:31.923
and I'm madly in love
with him, okay?!

36:31.957 --> 36:33.892
Did you have sex
with him?

36:38.497 --> 36:40.399
You did.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.169
(Grunting)

36:44.202 --> 36:46.338
Hey, hey, hey!

36:46.372 --> 36:47.739
Never hit a girl!

36:47.773 --> 36:50.075
Never hit a girl!
Get the hell out of here!

36:50.108 --> 36:52.711
Get out of here!
You want to go to jail?!

36:54.780 --> 36:55.981
(Door closing)

36:56.014 --> 36:57.516
(Breathing heavily)

36:57.549 --> 36:59.485
You want to tell me
what that was about?

37:01.587 --> 37:04.890
Just go, please.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.926
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.963
Mark...

37:16.535 --> 37:17.703
thanks.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.479
KATIE:
Turns out they were engaged
the whole time.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.881
They moved in together.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.719
I'm such a retard.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.821
Oh, sweetheart,

37:35.854 --> 37:37.923
I wish you would have told me
about it sooner.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.124
I could have warned you.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.459
Never get mixed up
with someone

37:40.492 --> 37:42.961
if there's a third party
involved.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.863
You almost always lose.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.999
You didn't sleep with him,
did you?

37:48.033 --> 37:49.134
Of course not.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.269
I'm sorry. Had to ask.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.444
Aren't you going to wish me
a happy birthday?

37:58.477 --> 38:01.447
Oh, sweetie,
I'm so sorry.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.683
Happy birthday.

38:07.519 --> 38:10.722
So, what do you want to do
to celebrate?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.992
I don't know.

38:14.025 --> 38:17.363
KATIE, NARRATING:
Thank God my name's
not really Katie

38:17.396 --> 38:20.832
and I'm 100% invisible
to the world,

38:20.866 --> 38:24.336
or I'd be so humiliated
by my life right now

38:24.370 --> 38:26.805
I'd probably kill myself.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.346
Do you stay friends
with your exes?

38:34.380 --> 38:37.349
Only if they can handle us
being platonic.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.485
Hasn't happened yet.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.887
Do you pee
in swimming pools?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.490
That's the only place.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.292
What's your favourite thing
in your bedroom?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.160
My heart.

38:49.194 --> 38:52.964
What's your least favourite
thing in your bedroom?

38:52.998 --> 38:54.600
My heart.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.637
What are you listening to
these days?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.773
A voice in my head telling me
that something wonderful

39:01.807 --> 39:03.875
is going to happen
any minute.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.511
It just has to.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.779
MARGARET:
I know the prices
are outrageous,

39:07.813 --> 39:09.581
but you just can't beat
the organic produce.

39:09.615 --> 39:12.117
Absolutely. The meats
are to die for.
Oh, I know.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.619
The other day
I got a leg of lamb.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.320
I'm telling you
it was this big.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.922
Hang on one second.
Is he down?

39:16.955 --> 39:18.123
Yup, boom.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.324
Oh, good.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.593
Did I mention
you look adorable?

39:21.627 --> 39:23.361
Oh, well,
I don't feel it.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.497
Barely got two hours of sleep
last night.

39:25.531 --> 39:28.166
Excitement about
Santa's arrival, or boy trouble?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.668
KATIE:
Boy trouble.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.269
Well, good riddance,
whoever he is.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.404
You can do better.

39:32.438 --> 39:33.839
Couldn't do worse.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.073
I have a nephew.
Oh.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.210
Onwards and upwards.
KATIE: Cheers.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.413
I thought we were the bad guys.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.381
MAN:
Well, no, no, no.

39:43.415 --> 39:44.616
People are people.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.118
You know, red, white, purple.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.954
We're all shit.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.123
You know what else
the Apache enjoyed?

39:52.157 --> 39:53.959
Sodomy.

39:55.326 --> 39:58.029
Most of Custer's
seventh brigade,

39:58.063 --> 40:02.133
second cavalry,
they were found buck naked,

40:02.167 --> 40:04.503
all torn up inside.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.305
Well, Ollie, listen,
it's been a riot.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.908
Cornflower blue.

40:09.941 --> 40:13.011
You're a real blond,
aren't you?

40:13.044 --> 40:14.580
Oh, yeah.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.915
You're real naughty too.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.684
Not tonight. Not-- Not--

40:18.717 --> 40:21.152
Not feeling it tonight,
turtleneck, okay?

40:21.186 --> 40:23.054
Now let me go
before I scream.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.356
(Laughing):
Whoa!

40:25.390 --> 40:26.892
(Imitating Indian war whoop)

40:30.796 --> 40:32.998
PAUL:
You better slow down there.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.466
That stuff will kill you.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.101
I still have
to drive home.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.402
You having fun?

40:37.435 --> 40:39.638
At my own party?
Not a chance.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.078
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.814
Maggie will get
suspicious.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.482
Really?

40:56.387 --> 41:03.361
*

41:03.394 --> 41:06.498
* Snow is falling

41:06.532 --> 41:10.235
* Do you hear those winter bells
ringing

41:10.268 --> 41:12.971
* In this winter storm?

41:13.004 --> 41:15.406
JOEL, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hey, uh, Merry Christmas Eve.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.208
It's Joel again.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.710
You never call me back,

41:18.744 --> 41:20.378
so I assume you're either
really busy

41:20.411 --> 41:22.447
or you hate Jews.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.149
(Laughing)

41:24.182 --> 41:26.552
So here's why
I keep calling.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.053
The third week of school

41:28.086 --> 41:30.088
I tried to jump
out of a dorm window.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.424
And I remember you spent some
time at a mental hospital,

41:33.458 --> 41:35.260
and I thought you might
be able to relate

41:35.293 --> 41:37.362
to what I'm going through,
and then we could be friends.

41:37.395 --> 41:38.964
My bad.

41:40.298 --> 41:43.535
* Take it in, take it in

41:43.569 --> 41:47.873
* And sing your Christmas song

41:51.476 --> 41:54.079
* The world is changing

41:54.112 --> 41:58.049
* Everything is painted
white and red

41:58.083 --> 42:00.185
* And gold

42:01.653 --> 42:03.889
* The stars are dangling...

42:09.494 --> 42:11.563
Oh.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.336
(Sniffing)

42:18.369 --> 42:20.405
Thank you so much.

42:20.438 --> 42:21.940
You're welcome.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.276
Oh, Dad.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.180
What did I do
to deserve this?

42:29.214 --> 42:30.982
You knocked up Mom.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.455
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

42:37.488 --> 42:40.926
Oh, these will keep
my nuts warm.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.696
Thank you, kid.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.577
How was dinner
with your family?

43:00.679 --> 43:02.313
Oh, thank you for asking.

43:02.347 --> 43:03.749
My--

43:03.782 --> 43:05.951
Don't ever spend Christmas Eve
with old Hindus.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.155
It was like Gunga Din meets
the Brothers Grimm.

43:10.188 --> 43:12.257
I couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.192
(Doug chuckling)

43:14.225 --> 43:16.194
Oh, here.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.931
I know what
my baby girl likes.

43:30.075 --> 43:32.110
Thanks.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.279
It's beautiful.

43:41.687 --> 43:43.989
DOUG:
I used to be your hero.

43:48.593 --> 43:50.628
Bet you don't even
remember that, do you?

43:50.662 --> 43:52.798
Not really.

43:52.831 --> 43:57.335
I used to come home from work,
you'd just go crazy.

43:59.070 --> 44:03.108
You'd grab my hand, show me your
latest Barbie or whatever.

44:06.011 --> 44:08.413
Then the witch
kicked me out.

44:08.446 --> 44:11.616
Right before Christmas, too.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.987
You latched on
like a goddamn pit bull.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.390
Wouldn't let go.

44:19.424 --> 44:20.859
Seriously?

44:22.427 --> 44:24.429
Screaming your lungs out.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.337
I can't believe
I don't remember that.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.576
(Turning TV on)

44:38.609 --> 44:40.311
CROWD, OVER TV:
Happy New Year!

44:40.345 --> 44:42.513
KATIE, NARRATING:
Right after Rory and I
broke up,

44:42.547 --> 44:44.682
Jade found
a new boyfriend.

44:44.716 --> 44:46.718
I had no one to celebrate with
last night.

44:46.752 --> 44:47.886
(Knocking on door)

44:47.919 --> 44:49.921
CAROLINE:
Honey? It's me.

44:49.955 --> 44:51.189
Come in.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.167
Oh, God.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.434
Dad's dead?

45:08.774 --> 45:10.208
Oh, my God!

45:10.241 --> 45:12.177
Congratulations!

45:13.779 --> 45:18.016
I don't even know
what to say.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.385
She's marrying the moustache.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.387
RORY, OVER PHONE:
Oh, no!

45:22.420 --> 45:24.756
I knew you'd understand.

45:24.790 --> 45:27.458
Come over, please.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.229
Uh...

45:31.262 --> 45:32.697
first I, uh,

45:32.730 --> 45:34.632
I got to tell you something.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.234
(Whispering):
Shit.

45:37.435 --> 45:38.970
(In normal voice):
Hold on.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.648
Okay, what?

45:50.681 --> 45:53.451
Okay, um...

45:53.484 --> 45:58.123
so the night we broke up
I took two sleeping pills.

45:58.156 --> 46:02.994
And Jade was over trolling on
4chan with my roommates.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.965
So, any resolutions?

46:06.998 --> 46:10.335
Well, I found out my boyfriend's
boning my best friend.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.871
I thought you and your boyfriend
broke up.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.807
We did.
Now it's permanent.

46:15.841 --> 46:18.243
I'm never going to speak
to either of them again.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.644
Smart choice.

46:19.677 --> 46:20.979
What about you?

46:21.012 --> 46:24.315
I am going back to work
part-time.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.451
Wow, really? So soon?

46:26.484 --> 46:27.919
Yeah, well,
I feel great.

46:27.953 --> 46:30.488
You know, I got my body back.
Why not?

46:30.521 --> 46:32.858
Paul's pissed.

46:32.891 --> 46:34.659
If he had his way
I'd stay home forever

46:34.692 --> 46:36.394
and be a broodmare.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.864
Do you know
what that is?

46:38.897 --> 46:40.798
Like a sad horse.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.100
Close, yeah.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.269
One that does nothing
but give birth.

46:45.904 --> 46:48.073
Do you want to have
more kids?

46:48.106 --> 46:49.207
No.

46:54.712 --> 46:56.447
(Cell phone vibrating)

47:01.352 --> 47:04.022
(Laughing)

47:04.055 --> 47:06.057
(Indistinct chattering)

47:17.869 --> 47:19.304
How's it going?

47:19.337 --> 47:21.706
Wow, you're even prettier
than I remember.

47:21.739 --> 47:23.308
And you're just
as sweet.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.675
Um...

47:24.709 --> 47:27.845
I can't believe you finally
decided to hang out with me.

47:27.879 --> 47:30.615
I hope I don't destroy
your social standing.

47:30.648 --> 47:32.617
Stop it.

47:33.952 --> 47:35.887
What made you finally
call me back?

47:35.921 --> 47:38.223
Your text made me laugh.

47:39.925 --> 47:41.659
Hey, you're legal, right?

47:41.692 --> 47:43.294
Yeah.
You should order wine.

47:43.328 --> 47:45.396
They won't card me here
if you do it.

47:54.072 --> 47:57.208
So anyway,
long story short,

47:57.242 --> 47:59.744
they've been fucking
ever since.

47:59.777 --> 48:01.947
What a roll you're on.

48:01.980 --> 48:06.084
I know. I have the worst luck
with guys.

48:06.117 --> 48:08.286
Yeah, I would say
the worst taste.

48:08.319 --> 48:11.156
I mean, you're the one
who picks them, right?

48:11.189 --> 48:12.457
Yeah.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.026
Anyway, it seems like your
problems go way beyond guys.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.861
I mean, you're confused
about a lot.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.896
Well, who isn't at our age?

48:18.930 --> 48:21.032
And that's why
the most important thing

48:21.066 --> 48:23.368
is to develop
self-awareness.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.536
I'm pretty much the most
fucked-up person I know,

48:25.570 --> 48:29.474
and I'm working really hard
to understand myself.

48:31.176 --> 48:32.877
Are you?

48:32.910 --> 48:36.314
Working really hard
to understand you?

48:36.347 --> 48:37.815
Not really.

48:37.848 --> 48:40.185
(Both laughing)
(Footsteps approaching)

48:40.218 --> 48:42.087
WAITER:
When you're ready.

48:52.797 --> 48:54.399
Right.

48:56.534 --> 48:58.436
(Vibrating)

49:07.678 --> 49:10.448
Hello?
(Woman sobbing over phone)

49:11.682 --> 49:14.319
Who is this? Affie?

49:15.653 --> 49:18.056
What is it?
Is it my dad?

49:18.089 --> 49:20.058
Affie, what's wrong?!

49:20.091 --> 49:22.060
DOCTOR:
You can see him now.

49:24.095 --> 49:25.730
KATIE, NARRATING:
When he fell,

49:25.763 --> 49:28.566
an artery in the sac
around his brain ripped open.

49:28.599 --> 49:30.968
They fixed it
and stopped the bleeding,

49:31.002 --> 49:34.239
but now all they can do
is wait and see.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.484
(Machinery hissing
and beeping)

49:59.830 --> 50:01.366
(Sniffling)

50:18.616 --> 50:20.451
(Typing)

50:43.174 --> 50:46.177
I used to pour my dad
his beers for him.

50:46.211 --> 50:50.648
Even though I get how sad
and inappropriate that is,

50:50.681 --> 50:53.284
at the time it made me feel
really special.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.122
And I'm still an expert
at pouring beer

50:57.155 --> 51:00.091
so that the foam
doesn't spill over.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.431
Oh, uh, one more--

51:06.464 --> 51:07.998
One more thing.

51:08.032 --> 51:10.868
My dad and I, we used to play
this game together

51:10.901 --> 51:12.703
when we were watching TV,

51:12.737 --> 51:17.041
and I would ask him if I could
have some of his beer.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.277
So he would reach over
to grab his mug,

51:19.310 --> 51:22.680
and when he did
I would flop my mouth down

51:22.713 --> 51:24.815
on his beer belly and...

51:24.849 --> 51:27.685
(Lips sputtering)

51:31.222 --> 51:34.759
And he would get all mad,
like I had tricked him.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.527
And...

51:36.561 --> 51:39.597
I would just
laugh my head off.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.887
(Knocking)

52:08.959 --> 52:10.428
Yes.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.332
Hi, my name's Amy Graham.

52:14.365 --> 52:16.967
I'm a student
of Professor Gallo's.

52:17.001 --> 52:19.036
I hate bothering him at home,

52:19.069 --> 52:21.071
but it's really,
really important,

52:21.105 --> 52:22.607
and I lost
his phone number.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.842
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not home.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.914
Darn it. Okay, okay.

52:29.947 --> 52:31.349
Uh...

52:31.382 --> 52:34.319
But I'll be happy
to give him a message.

52:34.352 --> 52:36.621
Will you please tell him there's
been a death in my family,

52:36.654 --> 52:38.956
so I can't finish
my paper on time.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.726
Which paper?

52:42.860 --> 52:44.795
The one he assigned.

52:46.431 --> 52:49.367
All right. I'm sorry.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.869
I mean, for your loss.

52:51.902 --> 52:53.504
That's okay.

52:53.538 --> 52:54.739
Merci.

52:54.772 --> 52:56.341
Bye.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.116
(Sighing)

53:06.150 --> 53:07.752
(Heart beating)

53:16.026 --> 53:18.296
KATIE, NARRATING:
During the week of work
I missed,

53:18.329 --> 53:19.997
Margaret kept her resolution

53:20.030 --> 53:23.033
and got a job redoing
a zillionaire's media room.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.635
For the next month

53:24.669 --> 53:27.372
she'll be working weekdays
from 9:00 to 3:00.

53:30.941 --> 53:33.611
So Kyle doesn't get
too traumatized by the change,

53:33.644 --> 53:36.447
Paul's going to eat lunch
at home every day.

53:43.654 --> 53:46.557
Well, I can't believe
how okay you seem.

53:46.591 --> 53:49.560
He had cirrhosis
for a long time.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.195
I knew he was going to die.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.830
I was pretty much
prepared for it.

53:52.863 --> 53:53.998
(Chuckling)

53:54.031 --> 53:55.500
The arrogance
of youth.

53:56.867 --> 53:58.068
Don't say that.

53:58.102 --> 54:01.038
No, no, I mean it
as a compliment.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.275
An ironic one, but if young
people weren't so arrogant,

54:04.309 --> 54:06.110
they'd really
be in trouble.

54:06.143 --> 54:08.145
What do you mean?

54:08.178 --> 54:09.747
Look, life kicks your ass.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.582
If young people knew it,
they'd crawl into the basement

54:11.616 --> 54:13.284
with a crack pipe
and never come out.

54:13.318 --> 54:17.788
Wouldn't take risks
or fight for lost causes,

54:17.822 --> 54:19.957
or even start a career.
I mean, why bother, right?

54:22.527 --> 54:24.729
You think you're okay
with your dad's death?

54:24.762 --> 54:27.432
Not a chance. It won't even
hit you that he's really gone

54:27.465 --> 54:28.999
until you're in your 30's,

54:29.033 --> 54:32.136
which happens to be the most
difficult decade of life.

54:32.169 --> 54:36.273
That is when the shit
really hits the fan.

54:37.942 --> 54:39.477
(Sighing)

54:41.111 --> 54:42.980
What are you grinning at?

54:43.013 --> 54:45.383
You.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.452
Tell me more.

54:48.653 --> 54:50.855
I want to know
everything.

54:52.757 --> 54:54.559
MARGARET:
Hey, you haven't quit yet.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.361
KATIE: Not yet.
MARGARET: See you later. Thanks.

54:56.394 --> 54:58.062
KATIE: Yeah!
PAUL: Hey, hey. Hi, sweetie.

54:58.095 --> 55:00.631
I'll be right back.

55:00.665 --> 55:03.067
Here's your salary,
and a little something extra.

55:04.769 --> 55:06.203
Thanks. Bye.

55:06.236 --> 55:07.738
PAUL:
Bye.

55:18.716 --> 55:20.250
PAUL:
"Dear Miss Kampenfelt,

55:20.284 --> 55:21.852
"since you expressed
a desire today

55:21.886 --> 55:23.754
"to learn more
about adult life,

55:23.788 --> 55:25.723
"here are 10 bitter truths
for your reading pleasure.

55:25.756 --> 55:29.660
"Number one: Complete honesty
is a complete lie.

55:29.694 --> 55:32.397
"Two, marriage is sacred
only to those

55:32.430 --> 55:34.298
"who have never
been married.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.402
"Three, money is more integral
to happiness

55:37.435 --> 55:39.470
than romantic love."

55:39.504 --> 55:43.140
KATIE:
"Four, every human being
is a contradiction.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.410
"Some hide it
better than others.

55:45.443 --> 55:48.879
"Five, never underestimate
the tendency of human beings

55:48.913 --> 55:52.349
"to act contrary
to their own best interests.

55:52.383 --> 55:54.952
"Six, were it not for the fear
of getting caught,

55:54.985 --> 55:58.222
"most of us would behave
like savages.

55:58.255 --> 56:01.125
"Seven, all sex
has consequences,

56:01.158 --> 56:03.528
most of them dire."

56:05.430 --> 56:08.065
JOEL:
"The older you get,
the faster time flies

56:08.098 --> 56:10.768
"until months pass
like days.

56:10.801 --> 56:14.405
"There's no such thing
as living happily ever after.

56:14.439 --> 56:17.141
Everything gets worse."

56:20.210 --> 56:21.579
He wants to fuck you.

56:21.612 --> 56:23.448
(Laughing):
He has, like,

56:23.481 --> 56:26.717
the most perfect,
beautiful wife on the planet.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.352
And that's why
it's not going to happen?

56:28.385 --> 56:30.087
Because he doesn't want to?

56:30.120 --> 56:31.456
What about you?

56:31.489 --> 56:33.190
I would never do that.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.092
You don't know me.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.661
JOEL:
You're self-centered.

56:36.694 --> 56:39.129
KATIE:
Ooh, news flash.

56:39.163 --> 56:41.499
JOEL:
You're promiscuous.

56:41.532 --> 56:43.300
KATIE:
I can't help it.

56:43.333 --> 56:44.702
It feels good.

56:44.735 --> 56:47.505
And plus,
I owe it to my fans.

56:47.538 --> 56:50.140
JOEL:
You're an incipient alcoholic.

56:50.174 --> 56:51.676
KATIE:
No, I'm not.

56:53.811 --> 56:56.013
Hey, what does that mean again?

56:56.046 --> 56:58.082
JOEL:
It means you're not an addict
yet, but you're well on the way.

56:58.115 --> 57:00.184
KATIE:
Oh, okay.

57:03.253 --> 57:04.755
JOEL:
I want to ask you something,

57:04.789 --> 57:06.356
KATIE:
Mm-hmm.

57:06.390 --> 57:08.526
JOEL:
You don't have to answer,

57:08.559 --> 57:13.498
but were you molested
when you were little?

57:13.531 --> 57:17.067
Because you remind me
of a friend of mine from school.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.435
She was abused.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.679
A little.

57:31.148 --> 57:34.451
I mean,
it just depends on...

57:38.956 --> 57:42.927
The summer before my parents
got divorced, I was like 6.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.762
My dad had disconnected
the cable.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.531
He was going to write
this book

57:46.564 --> 57:49.634
on worst sports injures
in history,

57:49.667 --> 57:51.536
and he didn't want
to be distracted.

57:51.569 --> 57:53.137
That's a good idea
for a book.

57:53.170 --> 57:55.139
Well, he never wrote it.

57:55.172 --> 57:57.608
Anyway,
since we had no TV,

57:57.642 --> 57:59.944
my mom sent me next door
to watch at the Solagee's.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.379
And Mrs. Solagee
would always make me

58:02.412 --> 58:06.416
these yummy prune
Hungarian cookies,

58:06.450 --> 58:09.053
and I'd get to watch
cartoons.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.824
But then when we were alone,

58:13.858 --> 58:17.461
Mr. Solagee would put me
on his lap,

58:17.494 --> 58:20.998
and he'd touch me.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.703
He would squirm around
the whole time.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.677
God.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.782
You know, it actually felt
kind of good.

58:50.394 --> 58:52.697
My friend Joel
thinks I need therapy.

58:54.098 --> 58:56.033
What do you think?

58:56.066 --> 58:58.202
He's probably right.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.004
I agree.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.574
Surprise, surprise.

59:05.710 --> 59:08.078
I'll find you
someone good.

59:08.112 --> 59:10.314
A lady, okay?

59:16.320 --> 59:18.889
KATIE, NARRATING:
JulietIsDead wants to know
what Joel meant

59:18.923 --> 59:21.759
when he said I was in
a mental hospital.

59:24.194 --> 59:26.764
When I was 13 I stole
a bunch of my mom's Ambiens

59:26.797 --> 59:29.533
and climbed in the window
of a 26-year-old lifeguard

59:29.566 --> 59:31.301
I had a massive
crush on.

59:31.335 --> 59:34.872
When he told me to go home,
I started crying hysterically

59:34.905 --> 59:37.241
and locked myself
in his bathroom.

59:39.977 --> 59:42.512
They kept me in the psych ward
for three days.

59:42.546 --> 59:45.616
Been pretty much anti-therapy
ever since.

59:47.084 --> 59:48.653
(Doorbell ringing)

59:48.686 --> 59:52.222
And now I'm thinking that maybe
what Mr. Solagee did

59:52.256 --> 59:54.959
really affected me.

59:54.992 --> 59:57.795
Maybe that's why I like
older guys so much.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:03.033
I just always that it was
because my dad was such a dick.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.002
(Laughing)

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:08.973
I'd like you to write a letter
to Mr. Solagee.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.878
He's really old.
He's probably dead.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.881
It's not for him.

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:20.885
(Paul sighing)

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:22.687
PAUL:
Kyle had night terrors again
last night.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.021
Even after I picked him up,

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.656
he cried for another
half-hour.

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.191
Scared the shit
out of us.

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:28.993
Well, what do you think's
causing it?

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.929
Well, I think it's that Maggie
went back to work,

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.899
but she doesn't want
to hear about that, of course.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.302
So, what are you
going to do?

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:39.569
(Sighing)

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.438
Just give him
some extra love,

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.174
and hope that she comes
to her senses.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.710
Hmm.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:47.444
She's so lucky
to be married to you.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.447
I don't know why she wants
to go back to work so quickly.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.216
It's ridiculous.

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.020
(Sighing)

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.221
You know what?

01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:00.024
It's not till tomorrow,
but what the hell?

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.433
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.873
It's a locket.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.742
Until you have a kid
of your own,

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:20.911
I figured a picture of Kyle
will have to do.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.782
Thank you. I love it.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:43.000
God, you're beautiful.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.602
(Door opening and closing)

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:49.907
KATIE:
So yeah, I mostly just hang out
with this kid, Joel Seidler.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.375
He's kind of funny.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.777
Look who it is.
Hey, honey.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.245
What time did she say
the samples were coming?

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.914
Ha! No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:59.649
I need something way more
specific than that.

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:01.551
Yes, please call back.

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:03.120
All right, fine.
I'll call you back.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.226
(Cell phone vibrating)

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.799
Well, hello.

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.333
DAN, OVER PHONE:
Hey, um...

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:20.070
Martine's out of town
for the weekend.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:31.048
Hey, why didn't you tell me
your dad died?

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.718
Because I hate
your guts.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.986
Oh, God!

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.355
(Panting and moaning)

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.390
Okay, slow down,
slow down.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.459
I want it
to last longer.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:45.395
You can do it.
You can.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:46.964
You can.

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:52.336
(Both breathing heavily)

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.474
(Birds squawking)

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:11.956
(Both shuddering)

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.727
That was a big mistake.

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.463
Yeah.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:23.200
I'm in love...

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:26.536
with somebody else.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.238
Oh, and suddenly
age matters?

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.307
Yeah, it matters, because
I'm 14 years older then you.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.144
I'm not 23. And I'm not married.
And I'm not your boss.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.746
Why are you freaking out?
All we did was kiss.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.516
Oh, stop. Stop pretending like
you don't know what's going on.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.385
That's why he hired you.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.953
He's a fucking scumbag.

01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:44.388
And what are you?

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:51.261
You need help.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.963
I know.

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:54.464
I'm in therapy.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:59.569
Good, well, hope you tell him
all about Spooner.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.738
It's a she.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.540
And I didn't.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.376
But I told her
all about you.

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:08.778
That's great.

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:11.215
Thanks.

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:13.850
Well, you can tell her this
next time you go:

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:15.585
you can tell her
that I ended it.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:18.322
No more. We're not doing this
ever again, you understand?

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.257
One of us has to be
strong enough to end it.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.759
Since I'm the adult
I guess it'll be me.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.861
Don't call me again either.

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.446
Good morning!

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:45.115
Gotcha. Okay, so you--
So you don't like that.

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:47.884
I thought I didn't
want it to happen,

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:50.254
but maybe I did.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:05:03.600
*

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:43.573
When I'm with him
I feel so special.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:52.482
I forget everything.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.936
CAROLINE:
Dear Dr. Sherman,

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.039
first off, I want to thank you
for making time

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:17.907
in your busy schedule
to see my darling Katie.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:19.876
She really is something,
isn't she?

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.278
One of a kind, all right.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.380
As much as she enjoyed
your session together,

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:26.850
I have decided to send her
to a different therapist,

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:29.186
one who specializes
in young women

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:33.023
and their many food-body
issues, a national epidemic.

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:34.558
Thank you so much
for your time.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:38.462
(Typing)
Yours truly...

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:42.232
Caroline Kampenfelt.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.573
(Cell phone vibrating)

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.646
JOEL, OVER PHONE:
Katie, Joel.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.382
Hi.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.586
I just wanted to tell you
that you're a monster.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.688
I've been a really
good friend to you,

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:08.692
and this is how you repay me?
By never calling me back.

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:11.961
Besides me, how many
straight guys are there

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.563
in the whole world
who like you enough

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:16.600
to be your friend without there
being anything sexual?

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.504
I'll give you a hint:

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.139
zero.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:25.142
I'm only three years
older than you,

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.677
but I'm so much smarter
it's ridiculous.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.248
You have no inner life.

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:39.123
(Sobbing)

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.234
KATIE, NARRATING:
Why was I crying so hard?

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:53.103
Who cares what Joel
thought of me?

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:58.142
And then I thought,

01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:03.079
Oh, wait,
maybe it's just hormones.

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:16.792
(Beeping)

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:24.334
(Inhaling and exhaling)

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.636
No, thanks.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.607
Okay.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.942
What's going on?

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.944
What do you mean?

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:36.880
You never say no.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.889
Why not?

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.895
I'm pregnant.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.801
Holy shit.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.035
Stop.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.569
I'm not keeping it.

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:02.906
And there's a decent chance
it's not yours.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:06.009
Then why'd you even
tell me?

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:07.743
Because you wanted me
to get high.

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:11.180
Yeah, well, if you're just going
to kill it, why not get high?

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.651
I might change my mind.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.625
Maybe.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.694
Oh, man.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.533
How many others
are there?

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.301
Two.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:37.506
You're a fucking whore.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.077
You're not even worth it!

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.412
(Door slamming)

01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:43.779
WOMAN, OVER PHONE:
Hello?

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.314
I'm sorry, I might have
the wrong number.

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:47.716
I'm looking for Joel Seidler.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.986
Who is this?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.955
Katie Kempenfelt.

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.857
Oh, Katie.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.494
You know he's clinically
depressed, right?

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.028
Of course.

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:02.031
We talk about it
all the time.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:04.601
Well, he made
another attempt.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:08.272
Pills this time.
Very female.

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:10.374
I was the one
who found him.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:12.276
Worst moment of my life.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.911
Is he okay?

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:17.414
Physically, yes.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:20.016
Mentally, who the hell knows?

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.085
He's at St. Jude's.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.620
Can I visit him?

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.355
No, honey we got to get
his chemistry

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:27.524
straightened out first.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:32.362
Will you let me know
when he can have visitors?

01:10:32.396 --> 01:10:34.764
Of course. Absolutely.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.300
Thank you.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.781
I'm so happy
you finally called.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.597
(Sighing)

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:55.479
(Sobbing)

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:09.393
I can't believe
I miss him so much.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:19.603
If only he had left
that silly card where it was.

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:23.006
What? What silly card?

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.477
I wasn't sure
whether to tell you.

01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:30.380
What? What are you
talking about?

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.295
One day I was
cleaning the house,

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:49.098
and in his closet
I found the underwear

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:50.734
you gave him for Christmas.

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:55.639
I put them away and threw
the box in the trash.

01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:59.308
Later, when your father
found out what I had done,

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:00.677
he was furious at me.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.180
In the middle of the night,

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.782
he rose.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:08.217
I asked him
where he was going.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.554
He said, "To pick through
the garbage,

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.623
like your cousins
back in Calcutta."

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:16.192
I woke up minutes later.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.828
The room was very cold.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.098
I found the back door
wide open.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.933
Your father
slipped in the dark

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:27.571
and fell on the way
to retrieve your card.

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:33.276
But he never even
opened my cards.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.311
He didn't care
about those things.

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.647
That's precisely
what I thought.

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:39.015
But no.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:52.829
I found them in his desk.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:55.198
All from you.

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:08.244
*

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:12.115
* Fog tints the windows

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:15.218
* And clouds up the view

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.987
* Sits in the trees

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:21.124
* And hugs the sky too

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:24.460
* Mr. Blue Sky

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:27.163
* Greets his old friend

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.633
* Blankets the earth

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:33.336
* To brings the year's end

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:38.508
* There's a longing
in the air

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.611
* And something tells you

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.548
* That wintertime
is here

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:50.119
* The nostalgia
warms your heart

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:55.058
* And everything feels

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:59.963
* Right

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.042
(Knocking at door)

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:16.713
You have an appointment with
Dr. Sherman Saturday at 10:00.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:18.915
I know you only
went once.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:20.316
What?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.218
That's non-negotiable.

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.491
(Blowing)
KATIE: Yay!

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.627
Happy birthday.
(Laughing)

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:31.995
Thank you. I love it.
Oh, good.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.963
It's gorgeous.
Thank you so much.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.965
Oh, come on.
You didn't have to do that.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.400
I know.

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:39.803
Let's see.

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:41.337
Very cute.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.706
(Laughing)

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:44.007
Aww, that's sweet.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.742
Very sweet. Thank you.
(Kyle crying)

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:48.745
Whoa, looks like somebody
wants to join the party.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:50.179
Oh, no, no,
I'll get him.

01:15:55.719 --> 01:15:58.755
So, what's it like
being 43?

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:01.357
MARGARET, OVER INTERCOM:
Hi, honey. Shh.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.226
Same as being 18.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.094
Just, uh, when you get up,

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.964
your back is a little stiff,
that's all.

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:16.673
There we go.
Good boy.

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.474
(Laughing):
Oh.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.076
God.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.813
Just your back?
(Moaning)

01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:35.892
This is your real present.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.227
(Laughing):
Oh, yeah.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:47.536
KATIE:
"To Paul on his 43rd birthday.

"Napping on the sofa,

"Two separate lives,
lying so close for a while

"until you both wake up and
become father and son again.

"May you always

"Sleeping close

I wish I could
share them too."

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:11.127
It's beautiful.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.528
Really?
Yeah.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.163
(Kyle crying)
MARGARET: Shh.

01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:21.404
I'm sorry.

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:28.411
(Paper tearing)

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.721
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.522
You understand, right?

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.190
I'm sorry.

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.759
It's going to be okay.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.194
Okay.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:49.298
Oh, God.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:52.601
KATIE, NARRATING:
Being pregnant is like
being seasick,

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:54.771
and you can't
get off the boat.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.775
The smell of bubble gum,
deodorant,

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:04.948
scented candles makes me want
to vomit from my toes.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:06.349
(Groaning)

DAN, OVER PHONE:
Hello?

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.265
I'm pregnant.

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:23.900
And the baby's yours.

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:25.769
So I thought maybe
before I got an abortion,

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:27.603
you'd like to discuss it.

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.205
Dwayne, you know better.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:31.274
You got to call me
during my office hours, okay?

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:32.876
Good night.
Wait...

01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:35.211

SHERMAN:
You don't need antidepressants,

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.554
because you're not
clinically depressed.

01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:47.490
You're grieving.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.926
There's a world
of difference.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.762
Not just for your father.

01:19:01.304 --> 01:19:03.840
KATIE, NARRATING:
When I was in the second grade
I liked to gross boys out

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:05.942
by eating flies and ants.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:08.444
Even a daddy longlegs once.

01:19:10.146 --> 01:19:12.982
In junior high
I stopped taking showers.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:16.452
My mom would say,

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:19.255
"Why do you want to treat your
body with such disrespect?"

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:21.424
I had no idea why.

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:23.226
But now I do.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:27.663
You probably thought
I forgot,

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.867
but I remember everything
you did to me.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.970
Sometimes I thought
maybe you forgot.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:37.874
But you were a grown man
at the time you molested me.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.710
If you are a Christian,

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:43.479
and I think you are,

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.481
then you know
what awaits you.

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:51.154
Yours truly,
little Katie next door.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:08.604
Katie.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.772
Miss Matsuo.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.807
How's the grand
experiment?

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:13.776
Excuse me?

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.611
Life without semesters?

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.047
Oh, it's great.

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.182
Good.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:22.718
Actually,
I just lied to you.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:25.021
It's really,
really hard.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.591
I'm sorry.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:31.460
That's okay.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.596
You know, I--
I think it's getting better.

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:36.265
I think I'm going
to be okay.

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.134
Well, you take care.

01:20:41.404 --> 01:20:43.272
* Did you hear

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:46.675
* Where I was going,
my dear?

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:48.844
* Did you see me

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:52.882
* Walking down that road?

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:57.153
* And do you understand

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:00.523
* That my life
(Unclear)

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:02.892
* And no, baby

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:05.028
* You know I'm not
very old

01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:08.731
Well, if it isn't one of my
favourite people in the world.

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:10.967
That's me.

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:13.937
What's wrong?

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:16.805
Just wanted
to come say hi.

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:18.841
I don't believe that.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.610
Come on in. Tell me
what's going on with you.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.985
I need some advice.

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:32.288
Okay.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:38.261
But I want to talk to you
about something first.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:44.800
I didn't quit
for the reason I said.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:48.504
My mom's fiancÃ© found out that
you're a convicted sex offender.

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:54.944
That occurred to me.

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.351
I wanted to tell you
the truth,

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:05.554
but my mom would have grounded
me until the end of time.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.690
She was afraid for you.

01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:10.493
Well, hello, I'm a girl.

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:12.495
But you're here now.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.399
What changed?

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:19.335
I need your wisdom.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.006
But I want to know
what your crime was.

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:26.976
Why?

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:29.378
I need to know.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.721
(Glenn sighing)

01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:40.456
It was a long time ago.

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:45.528
Please?

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:47.096
(Exhaling)

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:49.598
May I have one of those?

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.037
You smoke?

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:56.972
I'm what is known
in Nicotine Anonymous

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:58.907
as a periodic.

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:00.476
I start and stop.

01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:04.447
Right now I'm undecided.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.215
Have a seat.

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:13.056
Ah, there it is.

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:16.825
(Sniffing)

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.361
(Sighing)

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.065
Where do I begin?

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:27.636
When I was
your age, Katie,

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.439
I was a very angry,

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:33.008
nasty piece of work.

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:35.144
I was rarely
clean or sober.

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:36.912
I had hair down to here
and a full beard,

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:38.581
believe it or not.

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:42.351
And when I was 19 years old
I got busted for selling drugs.

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:47.090
So in order to avoid jail time
I enlisted in the Army.

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:49.458
And I just stayed high
all the time.

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:51.894
Well, surprise, surprise,
I get busted

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:54.397
and dishonourably discharged
and sent home.

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:57.966
And I stayed out of trouble
for a very long time,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.968
until one night
I got shit-face drunk

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:03.272
and showed up at the house
of a woman I knew

01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:04.840
who was a prostitute.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.209
Not one that I could afford,

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:09.312
but she had a soft spot
for vets.

01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:11.114
And the last thing
I remember was,

01:24:11.147 --> 01:24:14.917
she pulled out a bottle of rum
and a tab of acid.

01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:17.253
So when I woke up
in jail the next morning,

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:19.855
I had no choice but to take her
word for what happened.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:24.493
And the word of the emergency
room doctor, of course.

01:24:24.527 --> 01:24:25.994
(Sighing)

01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:30.499
I did not rape her
in the way

01:24:30.533 --> 01:24:32.668
that most people
would define that term,

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:35.604
but it was a very, uh,

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:38.607
cruel sexual assault,

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:40.476
and I paid the price.

01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:50.219
Now, tell me
what's wrong with you.

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:52.521
I'm pregnant.

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.229
Hmm.

01:25:00.263 --> 01:25:03.166
KATIE:
I'm just-- I'm too young
to have a baby.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:06.802
And I know-- I know I should
get an abortion.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.572
But days keep passing by,

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.374
and I don't make
the appointment.

01:25:11.407 --> 01:25:12.875
(Sighing)

01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:18.747
I just-- I think I'm scared
to go alone.

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:20.649
I think it's more
than that.

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:26.121
I think you're afraid
to go at all.

01:25:26.155 --> 01:25:28.123
And for good reason.

01:25:28.157 --> 01:25:31.327
Because if you do this,

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.331
there's no telling how
you'll feel about it later.

01:25:35.364 --> 01:25:38.000
You're afraid
you'll regret it.

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:40.369
Maybe.

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:46.509
But, you know,
very few people

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:49.378
ever regret
having had a child.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.648
Is that true?
Absolutely.

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:56.952
You want some more wisdom?
No extra charge.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.954
Please.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.690
Stop drinking
and smoking immediately.

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:05.861
And you must never see
any of these men ever again.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.730
Dump Paul?

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:09.498
No, no, he'll freak out.

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:11.300
Please, please, Katie,
listen to me.

01:26:11.334 --> 01:26:14.237
When a married man

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:17.306
is having an affair
with a beautiful, young girl,

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.707
no matter how much
he feels for that girl,

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:20.543
he's always relieved
when it's over

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.512
because he knows he's been
playing a dangerous game,

01:26:23.546 --> 01:26:26.382
and he's lucky
to escape alive.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:30.653
He doesn't love me?

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.055
Not the way you think.

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:35.090
But if I dump Paul,

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:37.560
then I lose my job.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:44.400
Well, you could always
come back and work here.

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:47.169
Yeah, my mom
would kill me.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.605
You don't need
her permission anymore.

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:50.706
You're an adult.

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:52.174
She'd kick me out
of the house--

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.243
You know what?
There just happens to be

01:26:54.277 --> 01:26:56.445
an empty room
above my garage,

01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:58.414
and you're welcome to it,
rent-free.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:04.219
You have to start making
your own decisions, young lady.

01:27:04.253 --> 01:27:05.954
Now, come on.
I got to close up.

01:27:05.988 --> 01:27:07.390
And I'll give you a lift.

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:12.060
Read any good books lately?

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:15.197
KATIE:
No. not even a bad one.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.433
But I've sort of been writing.

01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:21.270
I thought you'd be proud
that I have a blog.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:25.874
I like that it's creative
and that it's verbal.

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:29.144
What I don't like
is that it's public.

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:32.180
Your generation
is addicted to attention.

01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:33.649
(Keys rattling)

01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:35.318
I know.

01:27:35.351 --> 01:27:36.652
It's like we all want
to be famous,

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:38.186
even though we're not good
at anything.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.555
Precisely.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.624
You sure I can't
give you a lift?

01:27:41.657 --> 01:27:43.792
I like to walk.

01:27:43.826 --> 01:27:45.794
All right, then.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.433
Thanks for all
the advice.

01:27:50.466 --> 01:27:52.267
You're welcome.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:14.957
Something else
you might consider.

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:19.728
I can understand
how you feel,

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.197
how you think you're not ready
to be a mother.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:25.200
But have the baby anyway.

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:27.035
What's the harm?

01:28:29.204 --> 01:28:32.575
I'll raise it as my own, and you
can come and go as you please.

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:35.744
You can be as much of a mother
as you care to be.

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:45.087
(Car alarm chirping)

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.859
If I don't do
what you want me to,

01:28:50.893 --> 01:28:54.096
then could I still work here
and live with you?

01:28:56.899 --> 01:28:59.568
Of course.

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:17.520
*

01:30:10.439 --> 01:30:12.374
KATIE, NARRATING:
I want to thank everyone
who wrote to tell me

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:15.310
I'm a baby killer even though
I haven't even decided

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.613
what I'm going to do yet.

01:30:36.665 --> 01:30:38.734
(Bathwater running)

01:30:51.514 --> 01:30:53.081
(Turns water off)

01:31:01.657 --> 01:31:03.859
If I move in with Glenn,

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:06.361
it's the beginning
of my adult life.

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:09.097
On my own for the first time.

01:31:10.766 --> 01:31:13.769
It's a perfect time
to stop blogging.

01:31:20.543 --> 01:31:22.678
Can I do it?

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:26.181
Just live without
describing everything I do?

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:31.053
Can I cancel my reality show
and become a better person?

01:31:31.086 --> 01:31:33.689
Do human beings ever dream
a whole new life

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:35.524
and make it come true?

01:31:35.558 --> 01:31:38.093
Or do they always go back
to the way they were?

01:31:42.565 --> 01:31:44.967
I guess there's only one way
to find out.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.037
Say goodbye to all of you
and just live.

01:31:49.071 --> 01:31:50.973
Really live.

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:57.913
CAROLINE:
My name is Carol Granthum.

01:31:57.946 --> 01:31:59.982
I'm the mother
of Amy Granthum,

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.952
whom you know
as Katie Kampenfelt.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:08.557
A few minutes after posting
her final blog,

01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:11.960
someone called Amy
from a blocked number.

01:32:11.994 --> 01:32:15.831
The call lasted
a minute and 38 seconds.

01:32:21.136 --> 01:32:22.571
A few minutes later

01:32:22.605 --> 01:32:27.009
Amy got in her car,
drove away

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.411
and never came back.

01:32:29.444 --> 01:32:32.715
No one's seen
or heard from her since.

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:41.256
She hasn't withdrawn
any money from the bank

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:44.192
or even used
her cell phone.

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:48.196
The police believe the person
who called Amy that night

01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:51.700
could very well hold the key
to her whereabouts.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:55.203
(Typing)

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:58.073
I'm writing because
I need your help.

01:32:58.106 --> 01:33:01.076
Please keep reading.

01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:05.013
I have hired
a private investigator.

01:33:05.047 --> 01:33:08.550
He's questioned everyone
in Amy's life.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.318
He showed them her blog.

01:33:13.656 --> 01:33:17.325
To hide her identity,
she changed names and details.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.196
(No audio)

01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:24.066
Her boyfriend Aiden

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.369
says everything
Amy wrote about him is true.

01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:29.805
He has a terrible temper,

01:33:29.838 --> 01:33:33.175
but he insists that he would
never harm her.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:39.247
Dan is not actually
a college professor.

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.149
He manages a video store.

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:44.286
He says Amy's description
of their relationship

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:46.188
was mostly accurate,

01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:49.224
but that she never told him
she was pregnant.

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:54.797
The couple she works for

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:58.033
dispute only the most important
fact of the blog.

01:33:58.066 --> 01:34:01.804
The husband denies
any sexual involvement.

01:34:07.442 --> 01:34:09.945
Jake Seidler
is devastated.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:13.949
He regrets the cruelty
of his last voice message.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:23.558
Amy's best friend Noelle
is a drug addict.

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:25.627
She has a blocked
phone number,

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.096
but she says
that she did not call Amy

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:30.398
on the night
she disappeared.

01:34:33.736 --> 01:34:36.138
Roy Olson, her boss,

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:39.674
says word Amy wrote
about him is true

01:34:39.708 --> 01:34:43.311
except that he never offered
to raise her child.

01:34:48.884 --> 01:34:52.988
If any of you exchanged e-mails
or phone calls with Amy

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:54.990
in which she shared
any information

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.925
that might help us
to locate her

01:34:56.959 --> 01:35:00.228
please, please write
to me here.

01:35:04.499 --> 01:35:08.737
Amy is a wonderful girl
with a remarkable spirit.

01:35:08.771 --> 01:35:12.407
She's my life,
my whole heart.

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:17.412
Since her disappearance,

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:19.314
on nights when
I can't sleep

01:35:19.347 --> 01:35:23.018
I read and reread
Amy's postings.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.588
I read all of your e-mails
and comments too,

01:35:26.621 --> 01:35:28.791
even the most
vicious of them.

01:35:28.824 --> 01:35:33.361
I ask myself: Who would want
to hurt my daughter?

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:36.231
I hear the answer:

01:35:36.264 --> 01:35:37.900
everyone.

01:35:44.006 --> 01:35:47.475
* I did my time,
I stood in line

01:35:47.509 --> 01:35:51.346
* I waited for so long

01:35:51.379 --> 01:35:53.381
* Stand in circles

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:54.716
* Sitting duck

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:58.120
* I finally
jumped this pond

01:35:58.153 --> 01:36:01.957
* Now I get
this year to live

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:05.193
* I'm going
to live it well

01:36:05.227 --> 01:36:09.064
* 'Cause I want something
new to give

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:12.367
* In my life's
show-and-tell

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.504
* I'm gonna try things,
I'm gonna go there

01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:20.008
* Gonna take this
all the way

01:36:20.042 --> 01:36:23.378
* Test my limits,
I'm gonna wing it

01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:27.582
* And there's nothing
you can say

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:31.186
* So here I go
with an open heart

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:33.621
* 'Cause...

01:36:33.655 --> 01:36:37.059
* Right now my life starts
bum-ba-dum

01:36:37.092 --> 01:36:38.660
* Bum-bum-bum-ba-dum

01:36:38.693 --> 01:36:42.197
* Da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.999
* Bum-ba-dum

01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:45.934
* Bum-bum-bum-ba-dum

01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:49.137
* Da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da

01:36:49.171 --> 01:36:52.841
* Time to go off on my own

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:55.543
* It's finally my turn

01:36:55.577 --> 01:36:56.912
* It's my turn

01:36:56.945 --> 01:36:58.480
* No right or wrong

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:00.048
* 'Cause from now on

01:37:00.082 --> 01:37:03.185
* The stakes
are how I learn

01:37:03.218 --> 01:37:04.319
* Hm-hmm

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:07.555
* And now I get this year
to live

01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:10.926
* I'm going to live it well

01:37:10.959 --> 01:37:14.863
* 'Cause I want something
new to give

01:37:14.897 --> 01:37:18.000
* In my life's
show-and-tell

01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:21.503
* I'm gonna try things,
I'm gonna go there

01:37:21.536 --> 01:37:25.373
* Gonna take this
all the way

01:37:25.407 --> 01:37:28.877
* Test my limits,
I'm gonna wing it

01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:31.914
* And there's nothing
you can say

01:37:31.947 --> 01:37:33.315
* Oh, whoa

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:36.518
* So here I go
with an open heart

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:38.753
* 'Cause...

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:41.256
* Right now my life starts

01:37:41.289 --> 01:37:44.359
* Oh, whoa

01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:47.029
* But I know
you're scared

01:37:47.062 --> 01:37:49.164
* And it's tough to bear

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:53.001
* That your little girl
just walked out the door

01:37:53.035 --> 01:37:55.037
* She's gone, she's gone

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:57.805
* But it's time to see

01:37:57.839 --> 01:37:59.807
* The bad girl is me

01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:04.446
* And I just (Unclear)
little anymore

01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:08.316
* Oh, whoa

01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:12.654
* I'm gonna try things,
I'm gonna go there

01:38:12.687 --> 01:38:17.092
* Gonna take this
all the way

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.795
* Test my limits,
I'm gonna wing it

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:23.631
* And there's nothing
you can say

01:38:23.665 --> 01:38:25.167
* There's nothing
