WEBVTT

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Big smile.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.041
Look at her, Grace.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.208
She's bigger
than all of South Philly.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.166
It's not too late to
change our minds,
Darcy.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.625
You kidding? Two weeks
sipping wine in France.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.583
A trip back on her last
Atlantic crossing ever.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.458
This is going to be
the adventure of a lifetime.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.125
(Henry)
'Darcy!'

00:44.208 --> 00:46.834
- Henry?
- Darcy, wait.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.875
What are you waiting
for?
Go.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.125
Henry, what are you doing here?

00:54.208 --> 00:55.458
Couldn't just let you go.

00:55.542 --> 00:56.583
Come on,
let's talk about
this.

00:56.667 --> 00:57.834
We already talked.

00:57.917 --> 01:00.041
I just thought
maybe if you saw
this..

01:02.834 --> 01:04.333
Even had it engraved, see?

01:04.417 --> 01:05.792
'D.C. from H.S.'

01:07.875 --> 01:10.041
Henry, I-I can't. I..

01:10.125 --> 01:11.625
Keep it,
you'll come to your
senses

01:11.709 --> 01:13.083
once you get this
dumb trip out of your
system.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.375
I've got to go.

01:14.458 --> 01:15.875
You've never been
outside of Philly.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.458
All of a sudden you're
shipping off to Europe?

01:17.542 --> 01:18.959
You think you're
the Queen of England?

01:19.041 --> 01:20.959
- Goodbye, Henry.
- Darcy, wait.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.792
I'm done waiting for you.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.667
Did you actually ever see
my client at the wheel

01:53.750 --> 01:58.041
of the vehicle that you claim
ran your car off the bridge

01:58.125 --> 02:01.083
on "May 6, 2009?"

02:01.166 --> 02:02.166
No.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.625
'So your accusations
are based'

02:03.709 --> 02:05.375
solely on circumstantial
evidence.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.458
(Rush)
'Well, the evidence being
three speeding tickets'

02:07.542 --> 02:09.542
'for Moe Kitchener on
the school-owned vehicle.'

02:09.625 --> 02:11.417
Neighbors testifying
he parked the Suburban

02:11.500 --> 02:14.125
at his house every night,
except the night he was dumping

02:14.208 --> 02:16.125
Kate Butler's body
in Germantown.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.875
Paint scrapings and dents
are an exact match

02:18.959 --> 02:20.375
to the damage on my car.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.458
Not to mention the 12 stitches
on the back of my skull.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.000
(male #1)
'Your Honor.'

02:24.083 --> 02:26.542
The school may have owned
the vehicle on paper..

02:26.625 --> 02:29.583
...but it was your client's
car,
and everyone knew it.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.333
'Your Honor, move
that Detective Rush's'

02:31.417 --> 02:33.208
last two statements
be struck from the record.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.291
You opened the door,
counselor.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.458
- I do alright?
- Tore that jack-wipe a new
one.

02:42.542 --> 02:43.875
Nice job, Lil.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.667
You should've seen
the look on Major Moe's face

02:45.750 --> 02:46.834
when you went off like that.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.875
Knocked that smirk
off his ugly mug.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.125
You did good.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.291
Well, it'd be better
if we had you up there.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.667
Yeah, I begged
the DA to let me have
it

02:56.750 --> 02:59.834
but attempted homicide on a
police officer in Bucks
County

02:59.917 --> 03:02.750
'carries more weight
than the Philly charges.'

03:02.834 --> 03:05.083
What the hell
is he staring at?

03:05.166 --> 03:07.750
(Curtis)
'20 to life with any luck.'

03:07.834 --> 03:09.166
'Come on.'

03:10.834 --> 03:13.250
(Stillman)
'SS Americana.
They called her "The Big A".'

03:13.333 --> 03:15.250
Fastest ocean liner ever built.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.959
(Rush)
'Thing's been rusting away
on the pier'

03:17.041 --> 03:18.583
'as long as I can remember.'

03:18.667 --> 03:20.667
(Stillman)
Decommissioned in
'66.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.417
Before jets took
over,
this was the way

03:22.500 --> 03:24.083
to travel to Europe in style.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.667
(Valens)
Styling or not

03:25.750 --> 03:28.542
couldn't drag me out
on a boat for that
long.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.166
Never got your sea legs,
huh, Scotty?

03:30.250 --> 03:32.208
I'm seasick
just
thinking about
it.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.458
New owners are
working her over

03:33.542 --> 03:34.792
trying to refit her
for service again.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.041
Came across this last night.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.750
(Rush)
'Bag of bones
in a red dress.'

03:37.834 --> 03:39.792
Salvage operations stripped

03:39.875 --> 03:41.333
everything else
down to the metal

03:41.417 --> 03:44.375
but this engine room was
sealed off 40 years ago.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.792
Navy-built state secret.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.792
So nobody gets in or out.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.458
Till now.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.250
Take a look at
her neck, Lil.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.291
"D.C. from H.S."

03:57.375 --> 04:00.417
D.C. matches a passenger
named Darcy Curtis.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.375
It was reported
she jumped overboard

04:02.458 --> 04:03.959
during the ship's
final crossing.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.041
Missed the water
by a few hundred yards.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.834
'Big A was known as
the suicide ship.'

04:07.917 --> 04:09.792
The jumpers would leave
their shoes on the deck.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.834
Nobody really knows why.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.208
No shoes here.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.667
Master-at-Arms found them
against the "suicide rail"

04:14.750 --> 04:16.875
the morning she went missing
couple hours before they
docked.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.750
Shoes on the deck, body
stuffed in the engine room.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.792
Suicide ship's starting
to look more like a murder
ship.

05:04.583 --> 05:05.834
ME report's back.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.750
Dental records confirm
remains are Darcy Curtis.

05:08.834 --> 05:09.875
Broken neck from the fall.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.709
It's a remote area of the ship.

05:11.792 --> 05:12.959
Somebody would have to know
their way around

05:13.041 --> 05:14.041
pretty good to find it.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.542
This the whole file?

05:15.625 --> 05:17.542
Captain's incident report
from the suicide
investigation?

05:17.625 --> 05:20.291
Passenger lists, crew reports,
all in private hands now.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.875
It's weird
leaving
shoes like
that.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.041
Nice kicks.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.333
Shame to get them wet.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.709
Telegram sent from the ship

05:26.792 --> 05:29.458
to Darcy's boyfriend
in Fishtown, Henry Speck.

05:29.542 --> 05:30.667
"I can't."

05:30.750 --> 05:32.500
Can't what? Swim?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.458
Speck gave a statement,
said he thought it was Darcy

05:34.542 --> 05:36.667
saying no to his
marriage proposal.

05:36.750 --> 05:37.875
Till he heard she disappeared.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.041
'Died in '98.'

05:39.125 --> 05:40.834
The telegram had a time-stamp.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.500
Sent at 4:04 a.m.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.875
And 42 minutes later
she's reported lost at sea

05:45.959 --> 05:47.166
by the Master-at-Arms.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.583
Her traveling companion,
Grace Stearns, confirms

05:49.667 --> 05:51.500
she was missing
later that
morning.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.000
ID'd her off the shoes.

05:53.083 --> 05:55.125
Lil and Scotty are
talking to her now.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.000
We knew each other
from when we were kids.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.709
Morning Darcy disappeared, you
remember when you last saw her?

06:05.792 --> 06:07.417
Night before.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.792
I had gone to bed early.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.917
Darcy was more
the life of the
party.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.500
But she-she never came
back to our room.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.458
Darcy's boyfriend, Henry Speck

06:18.542 --> 06:20.542
got a telegram
morning she was killed.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.709
Says, "I can't."

06:24.417 --> 06:27.458
It's the only thing he had
to go on all these years.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.959
Trying to figure
out
why she did it.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.041
I guess it's not
a suicide note
anymore.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.583
Henry had proposed to her?

06:34.667 --> 06:35.750
In a telegram

06:35.834 --> 06:37.583
while we were on the ship.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.667
I was so excited for her.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.792
My late husband, Chester

06:41.875 --> 06:43.959
'he was Henry's cousin.'

06:44.041 --> 06:46.583
But she said no. Why's that?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.291
She meet another guy
on the ship?

06:48.375 --> 06:52.208
There was a man
she was after on that
ship.

06:52.291 --> 06:55.458
Just not in the way you think.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.208
(Grace)
'Since you got that telegram'

07:01.291 --> 07:04.041
you've been nothing
but doom and gloom.

07:04.125 --> 07:06.000
Darcy, what is it?

07:06.083 --> 07:09.333
I've just been thinking.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.208
How beautiful Paris was.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.166
The art, the
people
who live there.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.375
Everyone with their hand out
waiting for a tip.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.125
I mean, Chester was right.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.000
The French
are completely ungrateful.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.000
Here, read it yourself.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.166
"Marry me."

07:22.250 --> 07:23.208
Darcy!

07:23.291 --> 07:24.333
Henry finally proposed.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.166
Yeah, in a telegram.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.542
Well, who cares?

07:27.625 --> 07:30.417
All you have to do now
is say yes.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
Aren't you happy?

07:32.583 --> 07:34.583
It's what you always wanted.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.542
I know. That's what
I keep telling
myself.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.959
And then..

07:40.041 --> 07:41.417
You don't see any of those

07:41.500 --> 07:43.375
Parisian women
waiting around for a
man.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.667
They're off at museums

07:44.750 --> 07:46.709
reading,
talking to friends in
cafes.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.542
Not more of that
feminism jargon.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.709
We are from Philly, Darcy.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.458
France is...France.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.333
I don't know, Grace.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.834
Do you ever just feel
like you could do
better?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.625
Darcy, listen to me.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.834
Henry is one of the
last good men.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.083
They don't come along
every day

08:23.166 --> 08:25.583
and when they do,
you gotta snap them up

08:25.667 --> 08:28.083
and be grateful.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.875
Like you and Chester?

08:29.959 --> 08:32.917
He let me come along here
with you, didn't he?

08:35.542 --> 08:36.667
Hey!

08:40.667 --> 08:41.875
Hey!

08:44.875 --> 08:46.041
Darcy!

08:50.291 --> 08:52.875
Darcy, come back!

08:54.166 --> 08:56.583
I don't know what
she did to that
man

08:56.667 --> 08:58.750
but she came back
a few minutes
later

08:58.834 --> 09:00.083
with the necklace.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.875
She say anything about
how she got it?

09:01.959 --> 09:04.625
Said she just
flat out demanded it.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.041
It sounds like he knew
his way around.

09:06.125 --> 09:07.834
Is it possible
he worked on the ship?

09:07.917 --> 09:11.834
Well, he wore
those,
uh, uniform pants

09:11.917 --> 09:14.083
and those shoes
they all wore.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.291
Rough-looking guy.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.333
When did this happen?

09:16.417 --> 09:18.333
Day after we left Southampton.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.709
Didn't faze Darcy

09:19.792 --> 09:23.959
but me, I-I never
left the room after
that.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.750
Ship enthusiast
wants a court order

09:29.834 --> 09:31.375
for me look at any of her stuff.

09:31.458 --> 09:33.458
Took all the charm I got just
to talk her out of this box.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.458
Looks like you hit
the Big A mother
lode.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.291
Every passenger manifest,
crew list, captain's logs

09:38.375 --> 09:39.917
from the SS Americana.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.291
Check it out.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.125
"Kitchen worker, Cotter Doyle

09:43.208 --> 09:44.583
"picked up by
the Sergeant-at-Arms

09:44.667 --> 09:45.959
on the final voyage."

09:47.500 --> 09:50.500
"Petty theft, stealing cash
and jewelry in tourist class.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.834
Detention in quarters
the last day of the trip."

09:52.917 --> 09:56.083
Doyle's quarters are on the
same deck as the engine
room.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.375
So Darcy reports the guy,
suddenly he's cooling his
heels

09:59.458 --> 10:01.583
fifty feet from
where
the body's found.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.500
Guys. Judge is back.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.291
(male #2)
'All rise.'

10:09.458 --> 10:10.709
Sit.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.667
Bailiff, bring in the defendant.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.417
What's he doing
in street
clothes?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.875
What the hell?

10:18.959 --> 10:20.250
Not good.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.834
(Judge Wyatt)
'Given the defendant's lack
of
previous legal entanglements'

10:25.917 --> 10:27.291
his stature in the community

10:27.375 --> 10:30.375
and his lengthy
and laudable military
service.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.917
'The Commonwealth's request
for bail at one million
dollars'

10:33.000 --> 10:34.542
'seems excessive.'

10:34.625 --> 10:37.000
'In light of these facts
and Major Kitchener's'

10:37.083 --> 10:39.417
'perceived lack of flight
risk,
I'm going to grant'

10:39.500 --> 10:41.208
'defense's motion
for bail reduction.'

10:41.291 --> 10:43.000
'Trial date to be determined.'

10:43.083 --> 10:46.000
Defendant is hereby
released, sign own bond.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.583
'Bailiff, uncuff the major.'

10:51.166 --> 10:52.333
(Moe)
'Thank you, Your Honor.'

11:00.500 --> 11:02.000
He's walking.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.500
(Curtis)
'Had the son of a bitch
on the ropes.'

11:11.583 --> 11:13.208
Pritchard and the judge
are both ex-military.

11:13.291 --> 11:16.625
May be a case for judicial
bias,
but it's Bucks County's call.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.959
Should have done it in Philly,
kept it close to home.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.667
All misdemeanors in
Philly.
He'd be walking anyway.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.917
You said they had the case to
keep him in jail till the
trial.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.250
We have any recourse?
File a motion,
something?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.583
We got nothing. He's
out
till they get a
conviction.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.250
What kind of chance
we got of that now?

11:30.333 --> 11:32.667
Come on, guys. You can't
control
the judges, you know that.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.709
All I know is the guy who
tried
to kill me is on the street.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.417
Bad day?

11:42.250 --> 11:44.333
Matter of fact, yeah.

11:44.417 --> 11:48.583
Well, let's try and keep my bad
day from becoming your bad day.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.625
Either way, beats working.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.583
Working?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.208
A 60 something year old bellboy.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.125
That's a stellar
career track, Doyle.

11:55.208 --> 11:58.125
Rehabilitative opportunity.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.291
Mind my Ps and Qs,
maybe I get to stay

12:00.375 --> 12:01.750
on this side
of the bars for a while.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.917
Booted off the Big A
for sticky fingers in
'66.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.083
You got 20 theft
counts
on your record since.

12:07.166 --> 12:08.417
And what the hell's
the matter with you?

12:08.500 --> 12:10.834
It's medical.
I got a condition.

12:10.917 --> 12:13.834
Pathological Kleptomania.
I can't help myself.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.458
That what happened
with Darcy Curtis

12:15.542 --> 12:17.291
back on the SS Americana?

12:17.375 --> 12:18.500
Who?

12:18.583 --> 12:20.291
I don't know any Darcy Curtis.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.792
No, 'cause we got a witness
putting you in her stateroom

12:22.875 --> 12:24.500
with your condition.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.709
Now, she came after you.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.417
A day later, she winds up dead.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.583
50 feet from where you
were
detained in quarters.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.250
Murdered?

12:33.333 --> 12:34.875
They-they said she jumped.

12:34.959 --> 12:37.542
Yeah, off a landing
in the engine room.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.166
Walk me through this, Doyle.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.583
Alright, she files a
report
against your thieving
ass

12:44.667 --> 12:46.000
and it stirs up a
mess of trouble--

12:46.083 --> 12:48.291
No report.
She didn't want trouble.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.333
But there was
something she wanted.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.291
Hey!

13:06.875 --> 13:08.542
Give it.

13:08.625 --> 13:09.750
What, are you crazy?

13:09.834 --> 13:11.583
It's just a hunk
of silver to you.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.000
Alright.
No hard feelings
then?

13:15.083 --> 13:16.709
I ought to turn you in.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.542
I'm hooked in
on this ship.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.333
Anything you
want,
I can get it.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.792
- Really?
- Tickets to a show?

13:21.875 --> 13:24.709
Private tour, extra
towels?
You name it.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.000
Captain's Ballroom.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.667
Oh, you want to go shake
it
with the mucket-mucks.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.667
I can get you
in the busboy
entrance.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.083
- When?
- Tonight.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.917
So I just...show up?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.041
Lady, all you need are the
right
shoes and the right attitude.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.875
Miss Thing.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.333
She had the attitude covered.
That's for sure.

13:50.417 --> 13:51.750
You saying
she didn't turn you
in?

13:51.834 --> 13:54.333
You can ask
the first class head steward.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.250
Commodore Tightass.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.625
Gave me hell
for sneaking her in there.

13:59.709 --> 14:02.250
Know where she got
the snazzy shoes?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.417
Nope, but if she had
been wearing those

14:04.500 --> 14:07.208
in the Captain's Ballroom
that night.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.917
She would've never got caught.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.834
(Curtis)
'Psst.'

14:17.917 --> 14:19.709
Come here.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.834
- You defended me.
- What?

14:28.917 --> 14:30.959
Bucks County Courthouse,
2:14 p.m.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.125
You defended me.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.250
- No I didn't.
- You totally did.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.291
- What's your point, Curtis?
- Nothing.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.458
Just, you won't go out
on a second date with
me

14:38.542 --> 14:40.959
but you will go to bat
for me
in front of your crew.

14:41.041 --> 14:42.875
I didn't say I wouldn't
go out with you again.

14:42.959 --> 14:44.250
You're just not
returning my
calls.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.291
I thought you didn't
use voice mail.

14:46.375 --> 14:49.041
Come on, Kat.
I-I thought..

14:51.083 --> 14:53.417
I thought we had
a good dinner.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.166
Good conversation.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.959
- Great wine.
- Right? '90 Bordeaux.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.417
Perfect with the filet.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.542
Yeah.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.000
So, what the hell happened?

15:05.291 --> 15:08.000
You took me home
and you didn't
even..

15:09.875 --> 15:13.125
I mean, I thought we had
a thing and then I wasn't
sure.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.125
And I just. Look, I don't
have
a lot of time.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.834
I got a kid, and so do
you.
You know, I don't know..

15:26.500 --> 15:27.583
So?

15:28.458 --> 15:29.625
What do you say?

15:31.417 --> 15:32.959
Uh, yeah.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.500
Alright, then.

15:34.583 --> 15:35.750
Good.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.500
Um, gotta go.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.166
What's up with Miller?

15:55.250 --> 15:56.667
Good question.
What do you got?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.333
Those shoes left on the deck?

15:58.417 --> 16:00.500
Turns out
they're Gloria
Marks.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.291
- What, designer?
- 'One of a kind.'

16:02.375 --> 16:05.125
Very expensive,
exclusively sold two places

16:05.208 --> 16:08.291
a boutique in Milan
and on board the SS Americana.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.417
Too rich for Darcy's
steerage budget.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.041
Question is, who bought
Cinderella her slippers?

16:13.125 --> 16:15.125
Found our first
class
head steward.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.542
Crew log has him
as Geoffrey
Manning.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.375
(Scotty)
'He's standing
right next to Darcy.'

16:19.458 --> 16:20.750
Opportunity to spare.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.458
Knew the ship,
the engine room.

16:22.542 --> 16:23.834
Works as a maitre d'

16:23.917 --> 16:25.709
at Gibbs Steakhouse on
Rittenhouse Square now.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.041
Gibbs, same family
that owned the liner company

16:28.125 --> 16:29.083
that ran the Big A?

16:29.166 --> 16:30.500
The one and only.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.709
I've been trying to get a
reservation there for
years.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.709
They're always booked.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.375
I got this one.

16:37.417 --> 16:38.875
Go get 'em, tiger.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.667
(male #3)
'Allow me to check
our reservation book.'

16:46.709 --> 16:50.625
I'm sorry, sir, but that night
is completely booked, as well.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.125
'I'm so sorry.'

16:52.208 --> 16:53.291
'Right.'

16:54.875 --> 16:56.834
What can I do for you,
detective?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.250
- That obvious, huh?
- It's the shoes.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.750
You remember this lady?
Name's Darcy Curtis.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.667
You want to look at it?

17:09.750 --> 17:10.917
Or is that
like
your little
trick

17:11.000 --> 17:12.417
with the
nonexistent
reservation book?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.542
I'm sure you can see
that I'm very busy.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.000
Falling all over yourself

17:16.083 --> 17:17.750
keeping the Gibbs family happy.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.291
First on their ship, now here.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.709
It's called loyalty,
detective.

17:20.792 --> 17:23.291
And it's a two-way street.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.834
Well, I ain't in a hurry.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.583
I'm just going to
call up
a few of my, uh..

17:26.667 --> 17:29.375
...cheap shoe-wearing
buddies,
knock back a few at the bar.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.500
Your carpet's
treated
for fluids, right?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.125
I remember her.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.834
Mixed-up girl.

17:37.917 --> 17:42.125
She jumped overboard
on our last voyage. Very sad.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.875
Found her yesterday
in the engine room

17:43.959 --> 17:45.750
her body stuffed
under a
stairwell.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.041
Heard you booted her
out
of the Captain's
Ballroom.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.417
Night before she died.
Same night as that
picture.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.834
Well, I did see her that night

17:51.917 --> 17:54.000
but I wasn't the one
who gave her a problem.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.417
Where did you get this outfit?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.542
It's perfectly obscene.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.458
Those shoes.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.333
I know who you are.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.875
You-you do?

18:09.959 --> 18:12.166
They told me
the Countess of Montpensier

18:12.250 --> 18:15.000
was traveling incognito.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.709
Oh, don't worry. No one will
recognize you in that.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.041
- Your secret is safe with
me.
- There you are, darling.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.291
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.917
You're with the countess?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.083
Duke of Wilkes-Barre.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.875
Now, if you'll excuse us.

18:31.917 --> 18:33.458
That woman is an
insufferable gossip.

18:33.542 --> 18:37.417
I figured I'd spare you,
seeing
that you're new to the scene.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.959
I beg your pardon.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.917
Didn't you hear?
I'm a countess.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Well, that's not going to save
you from that officious steward

18:45.083 --> 18:47.667
headed over to boot you
out on your royal ass.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.792
Piano, quick.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.083
- You can keep up?
- Please.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.333
Don't you read
your society pages?

19:46.959 --> 19:48.583
Grace?

19:59.333 --> 20:02.166
After that, I didn't have
the heart to kick her out.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.792
Things had been
going so well

20:03.875 --> 20:07.583
before her friend became
...chemically inconvenienced.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.750
What about this Duke?

20:08.834 --> 20:10.750
- Piano Man got a name?
- Not sure.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.792
Ship had no shortage of
eligible bachelors that night.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.959
Miss Curtis's singing
made quite an impression.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.542
You ever see her
again
after that night?

20:18.625 --> 20:20.291
She left a few minutes later.

20:20.375 --> 20:24.291
I never saw her, or her
charming friend again.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.625
Heard about what happened
in court today, Lil.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.125
He smiled at me.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.709
The bastard smiled at me, boss.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.750
You let it get personal,
Lil, it could get messy.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.250
It's already messy.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.041
Guy ran me off the road.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.917
And now he's walking.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.458
Just do your job.
Let the rest work itself
out.

20:48.542 --> 20:51.542
- I'm not sure I can do
that.
- Well, find a way.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.750
You've got to
get
past this, Lil.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.667
Moe will get his day.

21:10.041 --> 21:13.875
Were you a happily married
woman back in '66, Grace?

21:13.959 --> 21:16.959
Uh, well, of course.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.166
Chester was one
of the last good men.

21:20.250 --> 21:23.333
- You ever cheat on him?
- What kind of question is
that?

21:23.417 --> 21:25.500
We heard about you hooking up
with some tosspot

21:25.583 --> 21:28.583
Casanova from first class
slinking down to his room.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.834
Oh, my God.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.333
I can see why you didn't bring

21:31.417 --> 21:33.125
that up last time we talked.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.917
That wasn't me.
That was the liquor.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.750
It's the first time
I ever drank like that.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.208
You worried about Darcy
keeping a lid on it?

21:41.291 --> 21:44.041
Afraid she'd tell Chester
about your night of romance?

21:44.125 --> 21:46.125
Darcy didn't judge me for it.

21:46.208 --> 21:49.166
She said I was
hard enough on
myself.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.792
I was so ashamed.

21:55.291 --> 21:58.875
The guy Darcy was
hanging with at the party

21:58.959 --> 21:59.959
you ever catch his name?

22:00.041 --> 22:01.208
No, she never told me.

22:01.291 --> 22:04.875
But whoever he was,
he was trouble.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.000
'Oh.'

22:18.166 --> 22:21.333
"Dear Countess of Montpensier..

22:22.834 --> 22:23.959
Thank you.

22:24.041 --> 22:26.875
"The Duke of Wilkes-Barre
requests the honor

22:26.959 --> 22:30.083
"of your presence
at dinner for two

22:30.166 --> 22:32.709
on the ship's private deck."

22:32.792 --> 22:34.291
Oh! Isn't it romantic?

22:34.375 --> 22:36.291
I can only wonder
what he wants in return.

22:36.375 --> 22:38.417
Oh, please, Grace.
Let me enjoy this.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.291
Oh! Only If it
were that easy.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.667
Where are the seasick pills?

22:49.250 --> 22:50.667
What are these?

22:50.750 --> 22:52.917
- Nothing.
- 'Birth control pills?'

22:53.000 --> 22:54.542
Darcy, is this what you were
bought at the pharmacy

22:54.625 --> 22:55.583
near the Champs Elysees?

22:55.667 --> 22:57.917
So what if it is?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.792
Times are changing, Grace.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.709
Uh, I can tell.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.750
I'm Just not sure
if it's for the better.

23:04.834 --> 23:06.166
'Of course it is.'

23:06.250 --> 23:07.625
It's the first time
in my life that I feel like

23:07.709 --> 23:09.583
I have a choice,
and I like it.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.291
I just hope that
you're thinking this through.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.458
I'm not.

23:16.542 --> 23:19.041
And that's what feels
so damn good about it.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.792
Isn't it beautiful?

23:28.542 --> 23:30.542
Maybe she was right.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.083
I don't know.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.500
And this is the
night
Darcy disappeared?

23:34.583 --> 23:37.917
She put on those clothes
and she went to meet him.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.041
'Oh, it's the last time
I saw her'

23:41.125 --> 23:44.834
and I was so petty
about her stupid pills.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.750
Sure you weren't jealous?

23:47.834 --> 23:49.458
And all that attention
Darcy was getting.

23:49.542 --> 23:50.959
'Well, sure.'

23:51.041 --> 23:54.667
Who wouldn't want
to be Cinderella for a night?

23:54.750 --> 23:57.417
There's a ledger
from the onboard boutique.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.625
A big order on the account
of Tucker Benton.

24:00.709 --> 24:04.458
Oh, five dresses, six
pairs
of shoes, expensive.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.750
Tucker Benton.

24:06.834 --> 24:08.333
Name wasn't on
the passenger
list.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.792
Oh, that's because
he wasn't a passenger.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.750
He was an employee
of Gibbs Shipping Line.

24:12.834 --> 24:14.000
Took care
of the first-class service.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.375
'Just got this
from the library.'

24:15.458 --> 24:16.792
Hmm.

24:16.875 --> 24:19.250
Tucker Benton was engaged
to the boss's daughter.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.542
Heiress apparent
to the Gibbs family fortune.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.875
Explains how he got
the cush job, living the life

24:23.959 --> 24:26.333
of Reilly on that ship.
Where's he today?

24:26.417 --> 24:27.959
Lives on a boat down
at Penn's Landing.

24:28.041 --> 24:31.625
Long John Stillman is on his
way
with Scotty, see what's what.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.250
Excuse me.

24:37.417 --> 24:41.041
So, those wingtips
you clunk around
in.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.834
How much they set you back?

24:42.917 --> 24:46.250
Well, you gotta ask,
you don't wanna know.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.500
Alright, look..

24:52.834 --> 24:54.166
Talk to my man.

24:54.250 --> 24:55.959
He'll set you up.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.709
Hey.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.542
Uh..

25:02.625 --> 25:04.250
Beat it.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.917
You got it,
didn't you?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
The trial date.

25:10.083 --> 25:13.875
Oh, uh, looking at May 15.

25:15.834 --> 25:17.834
Eight months?

25:17.917 --> 25:20.208
Guy's gonna be
out there?

25:20.291 --> 25:21.583
Yeah.

25:24.875 --> 25:28.458
Listen.
I'm sorry about all this.

25:30.917 --> 25:33.458
I'm not the one
you should be sorry
for.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.125
Chris Craft, '66.

25:46.083 --> 25:50.667
Yeah. 37-foot
Sparkman Stevens design.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.375
Winter in Grenada.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.166
Gotta move quick
before the weather gets
fresh.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.625
Nice ride
but it doesn't hold a candle

25:57.709 --> 26:00.166
to the Big A though,
does it?

26:00.250 --> 26:01.291
What's this about?

26:01.375 --> 26:02.750
The great
thing
about sailing

26:02.834 --> 26:04.625
there's no laws out there
on the high seas.

26:04.709 --> 26:05.875
You can get away with anything.

26:05.959 --> 26:08.083
Like with Darcy Curtis.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.041
What are you talking about?

26:10.125 --> 26:13.166
Darcy...jumped overboard.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.834
They found her body on the ship
wearing a fancy dress.

26:15.917 --> 26:18.500
'Any idea where
she might have gotten it
from?'

26:20.792 --> 26:23.125
I bought it for her.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.625
Oh, my God.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.083
What happened to her?

26:27.166 --> 26:28.709
You give a statement
when she disappeared?

26:28.792 --> 26:30.500
No, no, I didn't.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.166
It's strange, seeing as you
were
with her that night, right?

26:33.250 --> 26:35.875
Are you saying I had
something
to do with hurting Darcy?

26:35.959 --> 26:38.709
You had a lot to lose, anyone
found out about the affair.

26:38.792 --> 26:42.083
And thinking about
your fiancee in particular.

26:42.166 --> 26:45.166
Millie and I,
our engagement was a mistake.

26:45.250 --> 26:48.250
I called it off the day
we docked. Ask her yourself.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.583
I will.

26:50.458 --> 26:51.875
Until Darcy came along

26:51.959 --> 26:54.667
there was only one lady for me.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.917
The SS Americana.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.083
This is the romantic spot?

27:02.166 --> 27:03.667
Gotta say, Duke.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.875
Your castle kinda smells
like engine oil.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.333
This is the most
beautiful
spot on the ship.

27:11.417 --> 27:14.333
All those gorgeous lines
topside, all that finery

27:14.417 --> 27:16.083
it's nothing
without this
room.

27:16.166 --> 27:19.125
This fire in her
belly
pushing her on.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.667
- I sound like a lunatic.
- Stark raving.

27:24.417 --> 27:27.625
You know, it's, um,
it's the same thing

27:27.709 --> 27:29.875
I see in you, Darcy.

27:31.625 --> 27:35.208
Beautiful, but
that
same fire
inside.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.250
Let me guess.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.083
Some handsome Joe back home
gave this to you, right?

27:56.166 --> 27:58.125
- It's not what you think.
- What is it, then?

27:58.208 --> 28:02.709
It just...reminds me
of who I was.

28:02.792 --> 28:06.083
Well...at least,
who I think I was.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.500
And what kind of
person
is that?

28:07.583 --> 28:08.917
The kind
who falls in line

28:09.000 --> 28:10.917
accepts things
the way they are.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.417
Doing what
everyone expects

28:12.500 --> 28:14.917
just because
they expect it, just feels..

28:15.667 --> 28:16.750
I don't know.

28:18.375 --> 28:19.625
Like giving up.

28:23.041 --> 28:25.458
I know what you mean.

28:25.542 --> 28:26.625
You do?

28:29.750 --> 28:31.583
I'm engaged, Darcy.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.125
I should have
told
you earlier.

28:36.208 --> 28:41.750
Um...it just
doesn't
really seem real.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.375
Do you..
Do you love her?

28:48.792 --> 28:51.041
I thought I did.

28:51.125 --> 28:53.792
But now..

28:53.875 --> 28:57.917
Well, all I know is that
her family wanted it to
happen

28:58.000 --> 29:00.500
and...and then
that was that.

29:02.291 --> 29:06.792
It's crazy.
She, um, she hates
boats.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.875
She gets seasick
the second she steps on
one.

29:08.959 --> 29:10.750
And I-I would
be
just as happy

29:10.834 --> 29:13.125
never to set foot
on dry land again.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.000
Hell, I'd-I'd even
get
married out here.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.667
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.583
Well..

29:26.667 --> 29:29.125
Tucker, wait.

29:29.208 --> 29:31.625
I mean..
We can't.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.583
Can we?

29:34.667 --> 29:37.041
We have two hours
until we dock.

29:43.542 --> 29:47.333
Wow, decided to get
married
right then and there.

29:48.583 --> 29:50.291
I told her
I didn't come from
money.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.041
So without the Gibbs

29:52.125 --> 29:55.542
there'd be no more
fancy dresses, or
parties.

29:55.625 --> 29:59.458
Didn't care. Said all she
wanted
was me and the open sea.

30:00.417 --> 30:02.166
Crazy as it was

30:02.250 --> 30:05.417
at that moment we were
clear
about what we wanted.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.375
Right then.

30:07.458 --> 30:08.750
We wanted each other.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.125
You together the rest
of that night?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.208
No, no,
she went down to change

30:14.291 --> 30:16.750
into one of the
dresses
I'd bought her.

30:16.834 --> 30:19.083
I told her to meet
me
on the bridge.

30:19.166 --> 30:22.041
[chuckles]
But the captain was so
excited.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.709
He said that he would
open
the ballroom for us.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.375
I sent the head
steward
down to tell her

30:26.458 --> 30:27.750
'to meet me there instead.'

30:27.834 --> 30:30.500
Head steward? You talking about
Geoffrey Manning?

30:30.583 --> 30:33.542
I drove him crazy with
questions when he came back.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.625
What'd she say?

30:34.709 --> 30:35.875
What was she wearing?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.875
What'd he tell you?

30:37.959 --> 30:40.250
Uh, he told me
she was wearing a red
dress.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.792
'He called it
a bold choice.'

30:43.583 --> 30:46.083
Just like her.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.458
I waited in the ballroom
until the sun came up

30:48.542 --> 30:49.917
but she never showed.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.917
I-I never saw her in it

30:52.000 --> 30:55.792
but to this day I
picture
her in that red
dress.

30:56.709 --> 30:58.959
Beautiful as a sunrise at sea.

31:00.375 --> 31:03.166
[sighs]
Where was she
when you found her?

31:03.250 --> 31:05.834
The same place
as your last date, Romeo.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.333
The engine room?

31:08.417 --> 31:11.834
I can't let you sail off into
the sunset just yet, captain.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.542
Manning lied to us. He
Knew
exactly who the Duke was.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.709
Uptight SOB
saw Darcy in the dress

31:21.792 --> 31:24.458
she was wearing
when she died.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.583
Tucker was getting ready
to break off his
engagement

31:26.667 --> 31:28.625
with Millie
embarrass
the Gibbs family.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.667
Wonder how far
his loyalty went.

31:34.667 --> 31:38.208
Night Darcy Curtis died.
Told us you didn't see her.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.583
'Want to change that story?'

31:39.667 --> 31:42.166
Quite a long time ago,
hard to recall.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.417
You don't remember stopping
by her room to check on her?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.458
See what she was
wearing to the
wedding?

31:46.542 --> 31:47.959
Discretion, detective.

31:48.041 --> 31:50.458
Afraid it's part
of the job description.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.500
The Gibbs clan has been
very forthcoming

31:52.583 --> 31:54.208
with their
family history, Manning.

31:54.291 --> 31:58.083
Your father was the family
butler since like, always.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.166
Gentleman's gentleman.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.000
And his father before him.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.208
I grew up on the Gibbs Estate.

32:04.291 --> 32:05.667
Lived in the same house
with them.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.917
Job description include
making sure Tucker Benton

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
didn't step out of line,
embarrass the family?

32:10.083 --> 32:11.750
Break Millie Gibbs' heart?

32:14.083 --> 32:16.083
The Gibbs family
never instructed me

32:16.166 --> 32:17.709
to keep an eye on Mr. Benton.

32:17.792 --> 32:19.000
Well, maybe not
in so many words

32:19.083 --> 32:20.500
but you were
expected to anyway.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.417
Anticipate your master's needs

32:22.500 --> 32:23.709
without having to be told.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.417
It was a different time,
detective.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.375
Tucker was about
to run off with some

32:27.458 --> 32:28.834
guttersnipe in steerage?

32:28.917 --> 32:32.166
- You had to step in.
- Damn right I stepped in.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.458
I did what I had to do.

32:42.625 --> 32:44.792
Geoffrey Manning, miss.

32:44.875 --> 32:48.208
Might I have a word
regarding Mr.
Benton?

32:48.291 --> 32:51.375
Has..
Has Tucker changed his mind?

32:53.458 --> 32:55.041
Please, Miss Curtis.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.000
You know, out here
on this ship

33:01.083 --> 33:02.500
'it's quite common
to feel as though'

33:02.583 --> 33:03.709
'you're in your own world'

33:03.792 --> 33:06.041
that anything is possible.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.333
Is that so wrong?

33:09.417 --> 33:12.625
Oh, I've felt what
you now feel, all too deeply.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.709
I reached beyond my grasp.

33:16.792 --> 33:19.667
For a woman I had
no hope of attaining.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.709
In the end, I conceded.

33:24.792 --> 33:28.125
As you must,
that it was not meant to be.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.250
Meaning you gave up.

33:31.834 --> 33:33.542
Meaning I recognized
that there are things

33:33.625 --> 33:37.417
more important
than my selfish desires.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.041
And I put my hurt
feelings aside

33:39.125 --> 33:41.125
and I did what was right.

33:41.208 --> 33:44.000
Well, this is right.
I know it is.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.083
'Life's no fairy tale,
Miss Curtis.'

33:46.166 --> 33:48.417
At some point you have
to give back the slippers.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.625
Well, it's different
for us, Mr. Manning.

33:50.709 --> 33:52.750
- It's a different time.
- Listen to me.

33:52.834 --> 33:55.250
It only ends in pain for you.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.375
'For Mr. Benton.'

33:56.458 --> 33:57.917
For everyone involved.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.709
Is that what you want?

34:01.834 --> 34:04.959
Mr. Benton is prepared to
shoot
himself in the foot over you.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.667
'Please think
about what I've said..'

34:06.750 --> 34:08.750
'...before you help him
pull the trigger.'

34:15.166 --> 34:16.792
I had long ago realized

34:16.875 --> 34:20.291
that my love for her
was an impossibility.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.041
(Will)
'Millie Gibbs.'

34:22.125 --> 34:23.542
You grew up together.

34:23.625 --> 34:26.083
Couldn't bear
for her heart to be broken.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.917
Even if she wasn't mine.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.291
'I told Darcy the facts.'

34:32.375 --> 34:34.959
- 'Left the decision up to
her.'
- Load of crap.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.667
You didn't trust her
to make the right decision

34:36.750 --> 34:40.000
so you dragged her to the
engine room and made it for
her.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.208
Far worse, detective.

34:42.291 --> 34:45.458
I found her shoes
on the deck that morning

34:45.542 --> 34:47.125
and I didn't report it.

34:47.208 --> 34:51.291
Hold on. Captain's Report
said "the Master-at-Arms

34:51.375 --> 34:53.500
found the shoes at 4:46 a.m."

34:53.583 --> 34:56.083
He wasn't the first
person to find them.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
These the shoes you saw?

34:59.583 --> 35:04.583
That's right. About 3:30,
give or take a few minutes.

35:04.667 --> 35:09.834
So, at 4:04 a.m.
Darcy was already dead.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.917
Remember waking up
the ship's telegram operator

35:14.000 --> 35:16.333
at 4:00 in the morning, Grace?

35:16.417 --> 35:18.000
I would have been
asleep at that hour.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.959
Well, he remembers
you clear as day.

35:20.041 --> 35:21.333
Woke him up in the
middle of the night

35:21.417 --> 35:24.166
and then forgot to tip him.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.166
One lousy buck
could've saved you

35:26.250 --> 35:28.041
a whole lot of trouble, Grace.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.375
Well, you want to ask
him about it?

35:31.458 --> 35:32.792
- 'He's right here.'
- Don't, stop!

35:32.875 --> 35:35.792
Look, I know what you're doing.

35:35.875 --> 35:38.291
I would never hurt Darcy.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.041
She was like family.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.959
Would have been, if
she'd married Chester's
cousin.

35:47.041 --> 35:49.083
Darcy and Henry
were a good
couple.

35:49.166 --> 35:51.125
They would have been very happy.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.583
Hmm, like you and Chester?

35:53.667 --> 35:56.208
85, Cumberland Street.

35:56.291 --> 35:57.750
You know that address?

35:58.625 --> 35:59.875
No.

35:59.959 --> 36:02.875
A rental agreement here
with Chester's name on it.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.250
January '66.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.375
Now, why would Chester
have had an apartment

36:06.458 --> 36:07.792
all the way out in Fair Hill?

36:07.875 --> 36:09.000
You don't understand.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.667
He didn't live there.

36:10.750 --> 36:13.417
There's mail forwarded.
Ditto on his DMV records.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.208
Did Chester leave you, Grace?

36:16.291 --> 36:17.583
Had he already left you

36:17.667 --> 36:18.917
when you took
that trip with
Darcy?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.208
No! No, no, no.

36:20.291 --> 36:22.792
Lo-look, we were
working things out.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.333
- Come on, Grace.
- It wasn't over!

36:24.417 --> 36:26.375
We spoke to his family.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.083
He was stepping out on you

36:28.166 --> 36:30.250
practically
from your wedding night.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.083
(Lilly)
'But you couldn't admit it.'

36:33.500 --> 36:36.458
Reason why you're still
hanging
on to that wedding photo.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.125
I didn't have her courage.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.625
And misery loves company, right?

36:43.709 --> 36:46.750
If Darcy had just married
Henry
like she was supposed to--

36:46.834 --> 36:48.458
There would have been
another wedding.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.959
Chester would have remembered
what it was like to be in love.

36:52.041 --> 36:55.000
But Darcy wasn't going
to marry Henry, Grace.

36:55.083 --> 36:57.000
'Darcy grew wings.'

36:57.083 --> 36:59.542
And I was all alone.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.291
She didn't care what
other
people thought anymore.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.333
She was gonna take
the situation into her own
hands

37:06.417 --> 37:07.834
'and you didn't like that.'

37:09.542 --> 37:13.125
Steward found
Darcy's shoes at 3:30 a.m.

37:13.208 --> 37:14.458
Never said anything till today.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.750
This was sent
half an hour later.

37:17.834 --> 37:20.375
After Darcy was dead, Grace.

37:20.458 --> 37:23.834
Darcy's suicide
note,
you wrote it.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.750
You sent it.

37:26.834 --> 37:29.208
There was only
one reason to do
that.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.291
I never meant to hurt her.

37:40.375 --> 37:44.083
Uh, we know you didn't, Grace.

37:44.166 --> 37:47.375
It's time to tell
us what happened.

37:53.083 --> 37:55.750
I followed her
to the engine
room.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.917
I just wanted to comfort her

38:00.000 --> 38:05.458
to-to tell her that we could
work things out together.

38:06.834 --> 38:08.500
But she didn't care.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.875
Darcy, I'm sorry.

38:16.959 --> 38:20.041
Once we dock, you'll
forget all about that dandy.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.166
You'll marry Henry
settle in

38:22.250 --> 38:26.417
and...the four of us
will have so much fun
together.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.208
Like we dreamed
when we were kids.

38:28.291 --> 38:31.041
No, Grace.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.542
He was right.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.458
The reason I came back here..

38:37.250 --> 38:41.792
This really is the most
beautiful spot on the
ship.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.208
The fire in her belly.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.458
What are you talking about?

38:50.875 --> 38:53.500
I'm going to do it.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.000
I'm going to marry him.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.125
Right now.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.083
But w-wait..

39:03.709 --> 39:05.375
What about me?

39:05.458 --> 39:08.583
Be my matron of
honor.
Stand by my side.

39:08.667 --> 39:12.125
- Darcy, I can't.
- Yes, you can!

39:12.208 --> 39:14.625
I saw the way that you
were
looking at those dresses.

39:14.709 --> 39:16.875
Put one on and stand by me.

39:16.959 --> 39:19.500
But this is a fantasy.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.834
That man is using you.

39:24.083 --> 39:26.917
You belong at home.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.041
With me, with Henry,
and with Chester.

39:31.125 --> 39:33.667
Chester?
Grace, do you hear
yourself?

39:33.750 --> 39:35.750
We'll start planning
the wedding today.

39:35.834 --> 39:40.208
And we'll go to Joan's Garden,
and we'll get you a dress.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.000
And Father Concannon
will talk to Henry.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.875
But Grace, Chester left you!

39:47.583 --> 39:49.709
Wh-what?

39:50.542 --> 39:52.250
He's gone.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.375
You don't have to
keep
waiting for him.

39:59.208 --> 40:00.834
You have a choice.

40:04.333 --> 40:05.792
Shut up.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.667
He's not coming back.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.834
Everyone knows it but you.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.458
How dare you?
