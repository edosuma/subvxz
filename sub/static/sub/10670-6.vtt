WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:04.772
>> CAITLYN: You're actually

00:04.772 --> 00:05.673
trying something on?

00:05.673 --> 00:06.474
>> CANDIS: Why not?

00:06.474 --> 00:07.375
I've never tried on wedding

00:07.375 --> 00:08.376
dresses.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.378
>> CAITLYN: Either have I!

00:10.378 --> 00:11.412
>> CANDIS: For almost all of

00:11.412 --> 00:13.114
existence, that wasn't even a

00:13.114 --> 00:14.948
option for trans women.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.250
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.851
>> CAITLYN: My ex-lover is

00:17.851 --> 00:19.387
coming into town.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.821
>> JENNY: Do you feel a little

00:20.821 --> 00:21.822
on the defensive, or

00:21.822 --> 00:23.057
self-conscious with her at all?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.058
>> CAITLYN: I always felt on the

00:24.058 --> 00:25.059
defensive with her.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.060
>> JENNY: Did she tell

00:26.060 --> 00:26.727
you early on?

00:26.727 --> 00:27.728
>> KRIS: No.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.729
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too!

00:28.729 --> 00:29.730
>> KRIS: There was no "I am

00:29.730 --> 00:30.731
transgender."

00:30.731 --> 00:31.799
>> CAITLYN: I certainly told her

00:31.799 --> 00:33.534
what was going on.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.936
We are doing it in New Orleans.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.004
Yes we are.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.472
(indistinct chatter)

00:38.472 --> 00:40.341
>> KRIS: Kim was telling me that

00:40.341 --> 00:42.810
you, she had asked you a

00:42.810 --> 00:44.078
question about like do you want

00:44.078 --> 00:46.347
to date a guy or a girl.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.783
She told me that you said a guy.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.121
*

01:00.328 --> 01:02.296
(birds chirping)

01:04.532 --> 01:06.734
>> CANDIS: Hi, good morning!

01:06.734 --> 01:08.436
>> CHANDI: Good morning!

01:08.436 --> 01:09.870
>> JENNY: Made it back.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.904
>> CHANDI: Yes, we did.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.905
>> ELLA: Are you guys ready?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.141
>> CANDIS: We are ready!

01:13.141 --> 01:14.375
>> ELLA: 'Cause we are off.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.909
>> KATE: We're ready. (laughs)

01:15.909 --> 01:18.512
(all clamoring)

01:18.512 --> 01:19.580
>> CAITLYN: This is our last bus

01:19.580 --> 01:21.282
trip.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.050
(all cheering)

01:23.050 --> 01:24.051
>> CANDIS: I think we have to

01:24.051 --> 01:25.286
have some fun in New Orleans.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.287
>> CHANDI: Right.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.288
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I totally agree.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.289
My sister will be there, just

01:28.289 --> 01:29.290
about the time we get there.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.291
>> CANDIS: She'll want to party

01:30.291 --> 01:31.292
all night.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.293
>> CAITLYN: I am so glad that my

01:32.293 --> 01:33.294
sister Pam, yes, is coming to

01:33.294 --> 01:34.962
New Orleans!

01:34.962 --> 01:36.764
I love my sister Pam.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.765
She's been great, she's known

01:37.765 --> 01:39.400
about me, Caitlyn, for ever and

01:39.400 --> 01:40.468
ever.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.902
And, all those issues are in the

01:41.902 --> 01:43.237
past, and to be honest with

01:43.237 --> 01:44.672
you, it's just to have a good

01:44.672 --> 01:46.507
time with your sister.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.508
She's-she's looking

01:47.508 --> 01:48.509
for a good time.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.510
>> CHANDI: She's got the right

01:49.510 --> 01:50.511
batch of girls.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.812
(laughs)

01:51.812 --> 01:53.781
*

01:55.949 --> 01:56.950
>> KATE: Something about

01:56.950 --> 01:57.951
trans men, I love.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.952
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.953
>> KATE: They're so handsome.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.590
And in the same way we embody

02:02.590 --> 02:05.859
"lady," they embody "gentleman."

02:05.859 --> 02:07.195
Most people think that it's

02:07.195 --> 02:08.296
genitals that make you a man or

02:08.296 --> 02:09.363
a woman.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.364
>> CANDIS: Right.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.365
>> KATE: Right?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.667
And that's why one of the very

02:13.667 --> 02:15.503
first things when people think

02:15.503 --> 02:17.838
of well, trans women, what does

02:17.838 --> 02:19.273
she have down there?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.209
Trans man, what does he have

02:21.209 --> 02:22.543
down there?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.044
That comes up for people.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.213
>> CHANDI: It's a natural thing.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.214
>> KATE: Yeah.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.215
>> CHANDI: Although, everybody

02:27.215 --> 02:28.516
shouldn't ask that question.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.750
>> KATE: I don't know why not.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.884
You know?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.253
>> CHANDI: It's not a problem to

02:32.253 --> 02:33.787
discuss genitals if it's

02:33.787 --> 02:36.357
appropriate, you know?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.691
I just don't feel like someone

02:37.691 --> 02:40.294
who I meet on the street and-and

02:40.294 --> 02:43.964
we discuss the fact of me

02:43.964 --> 02:45.799
being trans, that should be

02:45.799 --> 02:47.401
their first question.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.237
>> KATE: So, it's a matter of

02:49.237 --> 02:50.238
manners, and...

02:50.238 --> 02:51.239
>> CHANDI: Right!

02:51.239 --> 02:51.905
For me, it's better...

02:51.905 --> 02:52.773
>> KATE: For good, good manners.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.707
>> CHANDI: Right.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.708
>> CANDIS: I don't think there's

02:54.708 --> 02:55.709
any time at all.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.710
I think your privates are your

02:56.710 --> 02:57.611
privates, personally.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.312
>> ELLA: Yeah, you know what,

02:58.312 --> 02:59.112
that's true, at the same time.

02:59.112 --> 02:59.880
>> CHANDI: That's, that's

02:59.880 --> 03:00.848
true, too.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.749
>> CANDIS: And I don't want to

03:01.749 --> 03:02.416
discuss my genitals with

03:02.416 --> 03:03.351
anybody and I don't want

03:03.351 --> 03:04.352
anybody asking me about mine.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.353
There's so much more to talk

03:05.353 --> 03:06.354
about.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.355
>> ELLA: But I think also part

03:07.355 --> 03:08.356
of that education is important

03:08.356 --> 03:09.357
to let them know that that's

03:09.357 --> 03:10.358
not the important part at all.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.359
>> CHANDI: Right.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.059
>> CANDIS: Right, yeah,

03:12.059 --> 03:12.726
yeah, yeah.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.727
>> ELLA: That's not validating

03:13.727 --> 03:14.728
my gender at all.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.729
>> CHANDI: Right.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.730
>> KATE: In the '80s, when I

03:16.730 --> 03:17.831
got my surgery, it was just

03:17.831 --> 03:19.333
assumed that that's what you

03:19.333 --> 03:20.368
would do.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.436
There was no-nobody saying,

03:22.436 --> 03:23.804
"Well, you know, you want to

03:23.804 --> 03:25.005
think about it for a while?"

03:25.005 --> 03:26.607
>> CAITLYN: Gender confirmation

03:26.607 --> 03:27.875
surgery is something I think

03:27.875 --> 03:30.278
anybody in my position, or the

03:30.278 --> 03:31.845
girls' position, of course, you

03:31.845 --> 03:33.681
look into.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.816
For me, I have no idea what the

03:35.816 --> 03:37.885
future holds.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.520
But it is really interesting to

03:39.520 --> 03:40.888
listen to all the girls, because

03:40.888 --> 03:42.523
when it comes to this, every

03:42.523 --> 03:45.759
person has a different way to be

03:45.759 --> 03:48.562
authentic to themselves.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.963
>> ELLA: I think, for different

03:49.963 --> 03:51.098
people, it might be different.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.301
But personally me, I always

03:53.301 --> 03:54.668
say, "Well, really, if I'm gonna

03:54.668 --> 03:55.936
get it, it's for the reason I

03:55.936 --> 03:56.937
want to wear a bathing suit, and

03:56.937 --> 03:57.938
not have to worry about certain

03:57.938 --> 03:58.939
things."

03:58.939 --> 03:59.940
>> CAITLYN: Right.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.874
>> ELLA: For simple,

04:00.874 --> 04:01.875
simple things.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.876
>> CHANDI: But you can put on a

04:02.876 --> 04:03.877
bathing suit now, mama.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.878
>> ELLA: Yeah, I know.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.879
>> CHANDI: And rock it, right.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.047
>> JENNY: You know, for me, it

04:07.047 --> 04:09.082
was, like, that was the thing I

04:09.082 --> 04:10.117
wanted.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.152
I didn't want anything else.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.054
What I wanted was-was in fact a

04:14.054 --> 04:16.424
body that was the home that

04:16.424 --> 04:18.792
I-I'd never been to, that I was

04:18.792 --> 04:20.027
always homesick for.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.028
>> CHANDI: Right.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.095
>> JENNY: You know, for me,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.230
it's-it's-it makes me really

04:23.230 --> 04:25.065
happy, um, and, uh, in all

04:25.065 --> 04:26.800
kinds of ways, um, but it took

04:26.800 --> 04:27.935
me a while to figure out how to

04:27.935 --> 04:28.936
work it, actually.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.904
(laughter, clamoring)

04:34.808 --> 04:36.777
(birds chirping)

04:45.419 --> 04:47.388
*

05:00.734 --> 05:04.372
(bell rings)

05:04.372 --> 05:06.507
>> KATE: Give it here, girls.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.477
Oh, you are so cute!

05:09.477 --> 05:10.578
>> ELLA: Gorg.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.779
>> CAITLYN: Interesting

05:11.779 --> 05:12.780
development in the last few

05:12.780 --> 05:13.781
hours.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.782
>> CHANDI: Oh.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.549
>> KATE: Yeah?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.550
>> CAITLYN: That, it looks like

05:16.550 --> 05:17.551
we'll have another guest.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.686
>> CANDIS: Who?

05:18.686 --> 05:19.687
>> CAITLYN: Actually, someone I

05:19.687 --> 05:20.688
know intimately.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.689
>> CANDIS: Oh.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.690
>> CHANDI: Ooh, ooh.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.057
>> CAITLYN: Really intimately.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.626
>> CANDIS: Kris.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.727
Really?

05:26.727 --> 05:27.761
>> KATE: Really?

05:27.761 --> 05:28.829
>> CANDIS: Really?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.097
>> CHANDI: Really?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.098
>> CANDIS: Kris is coming?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.400
>> CAITLYN: Now, wait, wait,

05:32.400 --> 05:33.401
wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.668
The way you said that.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.070
Okay, you went, like, "Huh?"

05:37.070 --> 05:38.606
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
>> CAITLYN: Why?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.409
Why would you, why was your

05:41.409 --> 05:43.944
reaction like that?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.179
>> CHANDI: Well, I'm just

05:46.179 --> 05:49.450
surprised that Kris would be

05:49.450 --> 05:50.951
willing to come hang out with

05:50.951 --> 05:52.720
all of us.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.422
She's still learning about you,

05:54.422 --> 05:56.256
and that's...

05:56.256 --> 05:57.458
>> CAITLYN: And I think--

05:57.458 --> 05:58.459
I-I get that.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.460
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.094
>> CAITLYN: Um, I think it would

06:01.094 --> 06:02.162
be very good for her.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.497
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.765
>> KATE: But okay, at this

06:04.765 --> 06:08.736
point, in your relationship,

06:08.736 --> 06:12.072
is she being good to you?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.544
>> CAITLYN: She's been fine.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.713
But she has not over the last

06:19.713 --> 06:22.249
year really called or, you know,

06:22.249 --> 06:23.316
I've reached out to her on a few

06:23.316 --> 06:24.452
occasions.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.786
We spent some time together.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.488
But Kris is...

06:27.488 --> 06:29.189
Kris is Kris, you know?

06:29.189 --> 06:30.223
>> CANDIS: But when you came

06:30.223 --> 06:31.492
out, she had, that's a lot for

06:31.492 --> 06:32.493
someone to go through.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.661
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I totally agree.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.662
>> CANDIS: And the fact that

06:34.662 --> 06:35.663
she's coming to meet all your

06:35.663 --> 06:36.764
girls, and to hang out

06:36.764 --> 06:37.765
is pretty cool.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.899
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it's good.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.333
No, I-I think it's very cool.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.502
>> ELLA: I mean, I don't think

06:41.502 --> 06:42.770
she's had a chance to really be

06:42.770 --> 06:44.137
around trans women, like, has

06:44.137 --> 06:45.839
she had that experience, yet?

06:45.839 --> 06:46.907
>> CAITLYN: No, no.

06:46.907 --> 06:47.908
>> ELLA: No?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.877
>> CAITLYN: Uh, she hasn't been

06:49.877 --> 06:50.944
around me that much.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.045
>> ELLA: No, then this'll be

06:52.045 --> 06:53.581
a, this'll be great.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.782
>> CAITLYN: Kris Jenner is

06:54.782 --> 06:56.784
coming to town!

06:56.784 --> 06:57.851
I am excited about her coming to

06:57.851 --> 06:59.119
town.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.287
Uh, I think it'll be fun.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.689
Because I think it's really good

07:01.689 --> 07:02.956
that she has an opportunity to

07:02.956 --> 07:04.224
hang around and actually spend

07:04.224 --> 07:05.726
some time with all the girls.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.260
'Cause, honestly, I think she's

07:07.260 --> 07:08.328
gonna love them.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.329
The last...

07:09.329 --> 07:10.330
>> CANDIS: Your situation.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.699
>> CAITLYN: ...time I actually

07:11.699 --> 07:13.233
had a conversation with her, she

07:13.233 --> 07:15.903
looked at me and goes, "Are you

07:15.903 --> 07:17.304
dating that girl?"

07:17.304 --> 07:19.239
>> CHANDI: Right.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.608
>> CAITLYN: That was you.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.408
>> CANDIS: But now, we get to

07:21.408 --> 07:21.909
meet face to face.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.544
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.545
Should we go in our own hotel

07:24.545 --> 07:25.546
room together, like, make sure

07:25.546 --> 07:26.547
she sees us go in the room

07:26.547 --> 07:27.581
together?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.582
>> CANDIS: Right, yeah.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.583
Just take...

07:29.583 --> 07:30.584
>> CAITLYN: Really, really

07:30.584 --> 07:31.952
screw with her, yeah.

07:31.952 --> 07:32.953
(laughter)

07:32.953 --> 07:33.954
>> CHANDI: Cait?

07:33.954 --> 07:34.955
>> CAITLYN: That would be neat,

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
yeah.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.890
>> CHANDI: You are picking up

07:36.890 --> 07:37.891
shade so well.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.892
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.893
>> CHANDI: You are picking up

07:39.893 --> 07:40.894
shade so well!

07:40.894 --> 07:42.863
(laughs)

07:52.139 --> 07:54.241
>> ELLA: Oh!

07:54.241 --> 07:56.544
Candis, are you thinking what

07:56.544 --> 07:58.546
I'm thinking?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.580
>> CANDIS: What are you

07:59.580 --> 08:00.648
thinking?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.750
>> ELLA: Bridal Boutique.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.953
Hi.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.154
>> CANDIS: Hi, how are you?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.155
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, look at

08:08.155 --> 08:09.156
it.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.157
>> CANDIS: I know, it's amazing.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.158
>> ELLA: I need to find the

08:11.158 --> 08:12.359
right one for you, Candis.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.360
>> CAITLYN: You're actually

08:13.360 --> 08:14.361
trying something on?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.362
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna do it, why

08:15.362 --> 08:16.363
not?

08:16.363 --> 08:17.364
>> CAITLYN: God...

08:17.364 --> 08:18.365
>> CANDIS: I've never tried on

08:18.365 --> 08:19.366
wedding dresses.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.367
>> CAITLYN: Either have I!

08:20.367 --> 08:21.368
>> CANDIS: (laughs)

08:21.368 --> 08:22.369
>> ELLA: What do you see

08:22.369 --> 08:23.370
yourself, like, rocking?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.371
>> CAITLYN: A wedding dress?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.372
>> CHANDI: What type of bride

08:25.372 --> 08:26.206
do you think you'd be?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.107
>> CAITLYN: I-I have, I haven't

08:27.107 --> 08:28.075
gone that far.

08:28.075 --> 08:28.776
>> ELLA: Well, we're

08:28.776 --> 08:29.476
gonna go there.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.143
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

08:30.143 --> 08:30.811
>> ELLA: We're going

08:30.811 --> 08:31.478
there today.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.212
>> CAITLYN: I've never gone

08:32.212 --> 08:32.946
that far.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.947
>> ELLA: I think epic would be

08:33.947 --> 08:36.183
an understatement of a bunch of

08:36.183 --> 08:38.451
trans women in wedding gowns.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.452
Which one would look great in

08:39.452 --> 08:41.154
Hawaii? (chuckles)

08:41.154 --> 08:42.189
'Cause I think that's

08:42.189 --> 08:43.323
where the wedding is.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.992
Let go of the fact that we're

08:44.992 --> 08:46.594
trans and just kind of realize

08:46.594 --> 08:48.962
that we're all just having fun.

08:48.962 --> 08:49.997
>> CANDIS: All right, here we

08:49.997 --> 08:50.998
go.

08:50.998 --> 08:51.999
>> CAITLYN: Challenge is on.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.834
Who wore it best?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.402
>> KATE: I would wear a

08:55.402 --> 08:57.370
rhinestone tuxedo.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.405
>> CHANDI: Ooh!

08:58.405 --> 08:59.607
>> KATE: With a top hat.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.941
>> CHANDI: I would probably

09:00.941 --> 09:02.075
never go inside a wedding dress

09:02.075 --> 09:03.443
store and ever try on a wedding

09:03.443 --> 09:05.613
dress, so this is like, a great

09:05.613 --> 09:07.514
moment.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.982
>> ELLA: Should I come and help?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.450
Oh, my gosh!

09:10.450 --> 09:11.719
>> CANDIS: I'm ready.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.120
>> CHANDI: Oh...

09:13.120 --> 09:13.887
>> KATE: Oh...

09:13.887 --> 09:15.656
>> CHANDI: I love it.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.924
Yes!

09:16.924 --> 09:17.858
>> KATE: Oh!

09:17.858 --> 09:20.861
What a glimpse of an angel!

09:20.861 --> 09:22.863
>> CANDIS: This is crazy!

09:22.863 --> 09:24.932
For me, trying on this wedding

09:24.932 --> 09:28.736
dress, I kind of am seeing it as

09:28.736 --> 09:30.738
a little bit of an affirmation

09:30.738 --> 09:32.505
of what I could possibly want

09:32.505 --> 09:34.241
have happen to me.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.943
For almost all of existence,

09:35.943 --> 09:37.645
that wasn't even uh, uh, an

09:37.645 --> 09:39.880
option for trans women.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.315
>> ELLA: Honey, come out!

09:42.315 --> 09:45.552
>> ALL: Oh!

09:45.552 --> 09:46.553
>> CAITLYN: How do they do the

09:46.553 --> 09:47.487
walk?

09:47.487 --> 09:49.089
>> CANDIS: (chuckles) No.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.323
Just natural.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.091
>> CAITLYN: Want to know

09:51.091 --> 09:51.759
something...

09:51.759 --> 09:52.726
Oh! Jesus Christ!

09:52.726 --> 09:53.961
(Candis laughs)

09:53.961 --> 09:55.729
Oh, my God!

09:55.729 --> 09:56.964
What do you think?

09:56.964 --> 09:57.765
>> ELLA: That is flippin'

09:57.765 --> 09:59.032
stunning, yeah.

09:59.032 --> 09:59.733
>> KATE: Girl, I need to push

09:59.733 --> 10:00.433
things.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.134
>> CAITLYN: I think we need to

10:01.134 --> 10:01.802
pose.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.469
>> CHANDI: Yes.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.170
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, here we go.

10:03.170 --> 10:03.937
Oh, thank you, Chandi.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.604
You can be my bridesmaid any

10:04.604 --> 10:05.538
day.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.406
>> CHANDI: Okay, babe.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.074
>> CAITLYN: Did I ever think

10:07.074 --> 10:07.875
this day would come?

10:07.875 --> 10:08.742
No.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.843
I've been at three weddings,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.411
okay, with the most boring

10:11.411 --> 10:14.848
clothes on in life, okay?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.516
Uh, finally I get to wear

10:16.516 --> 10:18.719
something... comfortable.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.721
>> KATE: Candis... Caitlyn...

10:20.721 --> 10:24.624
I now pronounce you trans-bride

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
and trans-bride.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.129
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

10:29.129 --> 10:30.297
>> ELLA: Kiss her!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.265
(Caitlyn laughs)

10:36.003 --> 10:37.270
>> ELLA: Oh, here we go.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.605
>> CAITLYN: T-shirts.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.773
>> CANDIS: Oh, T-shirts?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.208
>> CHANDI: T-shirts.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.409
>> WOMAN: Oh, my God!

10:42.409 --> 10:43.176
It's Caitlyn!

10:43.176 --> 10:43.911
>> CAITLYN: How about an

10:43.911 --> 10:44.745
alligator head?

10:44.745 --> 10:45.612
Like, we could put this on the

10:45.612 --> 10:46.346
hood...

10:46.346 --> 10:47.180
(Ella laughs)

10:47.180 --> 10:48.181
...of a car or something.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.149
>> ELLA: Yeah.

10:49.149 --> 10:49.817
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.251
>> ELLA: Cait, do we need Mardi

10:51.251 --> 10:51.985
Gras masks?

10:51.985 --> 10:52.820
>> CAITLYN: Actually, that's not

10:52.820 --> 10:53.787
a bad idea.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.521
>> CANDIS: Ooh, I like the teal

10:54.521 --> 10:56.023
one.

10:56.023 --> 10:56.724
>> WOMAN: Caitlyn, can you say

10:56.724 --> 10:59.326
"hey" to my snap, please?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.728
>> CANDIS: Wow, there's a whole

11:00.728 --> 11:02.029
crowd of people.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.096
(laughs)

11:03.096 --> 11:04.732
We're completely circled.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.598
>> ELLA: Yeah, I know, this

11:05.598 --> 11:06.366
isn't...

11:06.366 --> 11:08.235
>> WOMAN: You are gorgeous.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.070
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!

11:10.070 --> 11:10.838
>> CAITLYN: Let's go.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.604
>> WOMAN: Congratulations,

11:11.604 --> 11:12.339
Caitlyn.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.140
>> CAITLYN: Hello, how are you?

11:13.140 --> 11:13.907
Thank you.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.607
>> MAN: Caitlyn, you look

11:14.607 --> 11:15.308
beautiful.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.509
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
>> ELLA: That was insane.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.347
Being on the bus with Caitlyn, I

11:20.347 --> 11:21.915
forgot what it's like to see her

11:21.915 --> 11:23.116
from the outside.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.919
And every single time we were in

11:25.919 --> 11:28.088
public, just the reaction that

11:28.088 --> 11:31.058
she got from anyone who came in

11:31.058 --> 11:32.392
her path... that reaction

11:32.392 --> 11:34.227
shocked me, every time.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.229
Because it kind of brought me

11:36.229 --> 11:38.198
back to what she really has

11:38.198 --> 11:40.300
done, you know, for us.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.601
>> CHANDI: Good.

11:41.601 --> 11:42.369
What's your name?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.103
>> KAITLYN: Kaitlyn.

11:43.103 --> 11:43.904
I know!

11:43.904 --> 11:44.604
>> CHANDI: Kaitlyn?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.006
(laughs)

11:46.006 --> 11:47.107
How are you, Kaitlyn?

11:47.107 --> 11:47.841
>> KAITLYN: I'm good, I just

11:47.841 --> 11:48.508
want to meet...

11:48.508 --> 11:49.209
>> CHANDI: Great to meet you.

11:49.209 --> 11:49.877
>> KAITLYN: I see Candis.

11:49.877 --> 11:50.577
I've been trying to wave.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.411
>> CHANDI: You've been trying to

11:51.411 --> 11:52.079
wave at...

11:52.079 --> 11:52.780
Candis?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.447
Kaitlyn wants to say hi.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.448
>> CANDIS: Hi, girl.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.149
>> KAITLYN: This is my sister.

11:56.149 --> 11:56.984
>> CANDIS: Nice to meet you.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.952
>> CHANDI: Hi, sweetie. Mwah!

11:58.952 --> 11:59.686
>> PAM: Party time!

11:59.686 --> 12:00.520
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God!

12:00.520 --> 12:02.522
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.792
Sister Pam is here!

12:04.792 --> 12:06.293
Oh, God...

12:06.293 --> 12:07.427
>> PAM: Look at all these.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.228
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you got the

12:08.228 --> 12:08.929
beads going...

12:08.929 --> 12:09.797
What is this?

12:09.797 --> 12:11.231
Is this the Welcome Wagon?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.332
You don't even say hi?

12:12.332 --> 12:13.133
>> PAM: Hi.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.067
>> CAITLYN: My sister Pam is

12:14.067 --> 12:15.568
here and I'm excited about her

12:15.568 --> 12:17.004
spending some quality time with

12:17.004 --> 12:19.339
all the girls, so, uh, it'll be

12:19.339 --> 12:20.607
fun.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.308
Ready?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.009
>> CHANDI: Yes, let's go.

12:22.009 --> 12:22.709
>> PAM: Cait, what car do you

12:22.709 --> 12:23.376
want?

12:23.376 --> 12:24.177
>> CAITLYN: We're going back in

12:24.177 --> 12:24.677
the van.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.378
>> CANDIS: Note to self, leave

12:25.378 --> 12:26.046
Caitlyn at home.

12:26.046 --> 12:26.914
(laughter)

12:26.914 --> 12:28.581
And we can go shopping.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.550
(bells jingling)

12:36.223 --> 12:37.825
>> PAM: Cafe Du Monde.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.326
This is a classic.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.260
(Candis gasps)

12:40.260 --> 12:41.228
>> CANDIS: Look at the size of

12:41.228 --> 12:42.963
those!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.731
I might need a doggy bag.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.599
>> PAM: I know.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.835
>> CAITLYN: Don't inhale when

12:47.835 --> 12:48.836
you take a bite of that.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.070
>> PAM: Oh, yeah, I know.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.571
The powdered sugar.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.505
>> CANDIS: You have a, like, a

12:52.505 --> 12:53.841
full sugar high.

12:53.841 --> 12:54.607
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.909
>> CANDIS: Literally.

12:55.909 --> 12:56.944
My parents have been married for

12:56.944 --> 12:59.279
54 years.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.181
And I always thought of that as

13:01.181 --> 13:03.150
the goal, but then I realized,

13:03.150 --> 13:05.118
later, now... that can't be the

13:05.118 --> 13:06.419
goal.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.487
It has to be meeting the right

13:07.487 --> 13:08.621
person in order to ever have

13:08.621 --> 13:10.390
that goal fulfilled.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.859
Are there any negatives about

13:11.859 --> 13:15.028
being married?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.329
>> PAM: I think, many times,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.198
when you have had a failed

13:18.198 --> 13:20.901
marriage, you learn so much and

13:20.901 --> 13:22.369
you're a lot more tolerant the

13:22.369 --> 13:23.937
next time.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.738
You learn from those mistakes.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.174
You give each other a little

13:27.174 --> 13:28.108
wider berth...

13:28.108 --> 13:28.909
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.877
>> PAM: ...to be your own

13:29.877 --> 13:30.643
person.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.478
>> CAITLYN: A very important

13:31.478 --> 13:32.980
aspect of a long-term

13:32.980 --> 13:35.415
relationship is you have to let

13:35.415 --> 13:36.549
the other person live their

13:36.549 --> 13:37.584
life.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.585
Now, you can enjoy everything

13:38.585 --> 13:40.287
together, a lot of things...

13:40.287 --> 13:41.421
>> CANDIS: Right.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.722
>> CAITLYN: ...but like Pam just

13:42.722 --> 13:45.558
said, we both have things we

13:45.558 --> 13:47.127
like to do and we go do them.

13:47.127 --> 13:47.995
>> CANDIS: I thought it was

13:47.995 --> 13:49.129
really interesting, hearing Cait

13:49.129 --> 13:50.998
talk about the relationships.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.033
But I haven't stayed friends

13:53.033 --> 13:54.234
with any of my exes, so I don't

13:54.234 --> 13:56.236
know how it's going to be with

13:56.236 --> 13:57.537
Kris.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.339
It's just an awkward situation.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.440
>> CANDIS: These were really

14:00.440 --> 14:01.174
good.

14:01.174 --> 14:01.909
>> CAITLYN: You need a sugar

14:01.909 --> 14:02.509
daddy.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.176
(Candis laughs)

14:03.176 --> 14:04.144
Are you gonna eat this or not?

14:04.144 --> 14:04.811
>> PAM: You can be that.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.478
>> CANDIS: I'm not.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.146
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

14:06.146 --> 14:06.813
>> PAM: Sugar momma.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.514
>> CANDIS: They were really

14:07.514 --> 14:08.248
good.

14:08.248 --> 14:08.916
>> CAITLYN: I know.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.118
My ex-lover is coming into town.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.752
>> JENNY: What has to happen to

14:12.752 --> 14:14.454
improve your relationship?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.788
>> CAITLYN: I-I don't know.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.624
(knock at door)

14:17.624 --> 14:18.926
(cheering)

14:18.926 --> 14:20.293
>> KRIS: Kim was telling me that

14:20.293 --> 14:22.362
she had asked you a question

14:22.362 --> 14:23.997
about, like, do you want to date

14:23.997 --> 14:25.933
a guy or a girl?

14:25.933 --> 14:27.567
She told me that you said, "A

14:27.567 --> 14:29.536
guy."

14:30.938 --> 14:33.440
(bell rings)

14:33.440 --> 14:34.541
>> JENNY: God, you've trashed

14:34.541 --> 14:35.943
the place.

14:35.943 --> 14:36.743
>> CAITLYN: I'm trying to figure

14:36.743 --> 14:38.111
out what the hell do I wear?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.412
Put it this way, Jenny: my

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
ex-lover is coming into town.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.415
>> JENNY: Wait, is this, is this

14:42.415 --> 14:43.450
the, uh, this is your

14:43.450 --> 14:44.151
confessional cam?

14:44.151 --> 14:44.952
How-how do you turn this on?

14:44.952 --> 14:45.552
You know how to, turn it on?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.286
>> CAITLYN: Want me to show you

14:46.286 --> 14:46.786
how to do this?

14:46.786 --> 14:47.554
>> JENNY: Yeah, okay, 'cause

14:47.554 --> 14:48.421
we're gonna do, we're gonna do

14:48.421 --> 14:48.956
a thing.

14:48.956 --> 14:49.756
>> CAITLYN: Oh, we're gonna do a

14:49.756 --> 14:50.423
thing, together? Oh, my God.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.158
>> JENNY: We're gonna do a

14:51.158 --> 14:51.858
confessional, a confessional.

14:51.858 --> 14:52.525
>> CAITLYN: All right.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.193
There's a lot of work.

14:53.193 --> 14:53.860
Sit down, right here.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.594
>> JENNY: All right, all right.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.328
>> CAITLYN: You got to get it...

14:55.328 --> 14:56.029
'cause you got to get the

14:56.029 --> 14:56.964
lighting good, 'cause there's no

14:56.964 --> 14:57.397
lighting.

14:57.397 --> 14:57.965
>> JENNY: Yeah. Yeah.

14:57.965 --> 14:58.465
Yes, I know.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.166
I know how important it is for

14:59.166 --> 14:59.832
you.

14:59.832 --> 15:00.600
>> CAITLYN: As Kim says, it's

15:00.600 --> 15:02.569
all about the lighting.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.603
Ah, the red dot's on.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.371
>> JENNY: Okay.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.072
>> CAITLYN: It's working.

15:05.072 --> 15:05.738
>> JENNY: All right, so...

15:05.738 --> 15:06.439
>> CAITLYN: This is the first

15:06.439 --> 15:07.174
time I've ever done it with

15:07.174 --> 15:07.674
anybody.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.175
>> JENNY: Yeah.

15:08.175 --> 15:08.875
>> CAITLYN: Hold on. Hold on.

15:08.875 --> 15:09.642
>> JENNY: We're here with

15:09.642 --> 15:10.143
Caitlyn Jenner.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.544
So, Caitlyn: how are you feeling

15:11.544 --> 15:14.247
about your ex-wife meeting your

15:14.247 --> 15:15.983
new lover, Candis Cayne?

15:15.983 --> 15:16.984
>> CAITLYN: Oh, what...?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.018
Candis is not... she's my

15:18.018 --> 15:19.086
friend. Yeah.

15:19.086 --> 15:19.819
>> JENNY (reporter voice): So I

15:19.819 --> 15:20.587
just want to know how it feels

15:20.587 --> 15:22.122
to have your ex-wife meet you

15:22.122 --> 15:23.623
new lover?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.225
(Caitlyn laughing)

15:25.225 --> 15:26.393
>> CAITLYN: This is going

15:26.393 --> 15:27.294
downhill right from the

15:27.294 --> 15:27.995
beginning.

15:27.995 --> 15:28.728
>> JENNY: I'm trying my best.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.197
>> CAITLYN: Uh... I don't know.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.498
I'll find out.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.034
Um... no, uh... actually, I'm

15:34.034 --> 15:35.002
looking forward to, uh, Kris

15:35.002 --> 15:35.835
coming.

15:35.835 --> 15:36.569
>> JENNY: And when was the last

15:36.569 --> 15:37.237
time you-you, like, really

15:37.237 --> 15:38.038
talked?

15:38.038 --> 15:38.705
>> CAITLYN: Oh, we really

15:38.705 --> 15:39.372
talked?

15:39.372 --> 15:41.108
>> JENNY: Yeah.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.242
>> CAITLYN: I don't...

15:42.242 --> 15:43.310
How did that go?

15:43.310 --> 15:44.477
>> KRIS: I was struggling and

15:44.477 --> 15:45.912
having a really hard time...

15:45.912 --> 15:47.714
>> CAITLYN: With what?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.282
>> KRIS: Your transition.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.750
And this, like, leaving us in

15:50.750 --> 15:52.052
the dust.

15:52.052 --> 15:52.885
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving you

15:52.885 --> 15:53.653
guys in the dust.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.454
>> KRIS: You left us... you left

15:54.454 --> 15:55.355
us in the dust.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.489
>> CAITLYN: What... who...?

15:56.489 --> 15:57.357
>> KRIS: Basically, I'm just

15:57.357 --> 15:58.258
saying I went through a hard

15:58.258 --> 15:59.026
time.

15:59.026 --> 15:59.792
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving

15:59.792 --> 16:00.460
anybody-- I'm not going

16:00.460 --> 16:01.261
anywhere.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.095
>> KRIS: You know, it was like,

16:02.095 --> 16:03.796
what happened to... just... the

16:03.796 --> 16:05.032
life we had together?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.033
It's like you don't, you just

16:06.033 --> 16:07.200
threw that away.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.101
>> CAITLYN: I thought it went

16:08.101 --> 16:09.236
pretty good.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.170
But then, after it was over

16:10.170 --> 16:13.040
with, I kind of... uh, I-I kind

16:13.040 --> 16:14.874
of struggled with it a lot.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.276
'Cause, you know, there's a lot

16:16.276 --> 16:17.310
of emotions there.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.311
>> JENNY: Well, yeah.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.179
>> CAITLYN: There's 23 years of

16:19.179 --> 16:21.048
life together.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.216
Mmm... that's tough stuff. Yeah.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.051
>> JENNY: Do you... do you feel

16:24.051 --> 16:25.052
a little on the, on the

16:25.052 --> 16:26.119
defensive or self-conscious with

16:26.119 --> 16:27.854
her at all?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.122
>> CAITLYN: I always felt on the

16:29.122 --> 16:30.057
defensive with her.

16:30.057 --> 16:30.957
>> JENNY: Okay, then, different

16:30.957 --> 16:31.624
question.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.625
>> CAITLYN: Um...

16:32.625 --> 16:34.061
There's just another element

16:34.061 --> 16:35.062
here that I don't quite

16:35.062 --> 16:36.696
understand what she...

16:36.696 --> 16:37.664
Hopefully, have some time to

16:37.664 --> 16:38.831
talk to her about it.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.069
I-I feel sometimes, now, she

16:42.069 --> 16:43.370
gets more upset than she was

16:43.370 --> 16:44.471
when we were together.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.772
You know?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.375
Um... uh...

16:48.375 --> 16:51.311
And I don't understand why.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.245
Because she was... I was very

16:52.245 --> 16:53.413
honest with her and open with

16:53.413 --> 16:54.247
her.

16:54.247 --> 16:54.914
Now, sure...

16:54.914 --> 16:55.582
>> JENNY: Upset about trans

16:55.582 --> 16:56.383
stuff?

16:56.383 --> 16:57.117
>> CAITLYN: About... yeah, about

16:57.117 --> 16:57.784
gender issues.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.518
>> JENNY: If I was your ex-wife

16:58.518 --> 16:59.552
and I loved you, it would hurt

16:59.552 --> 17:02.789
my feelings.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.126
What has to happen in order to

17:06.126 --> 17:09.829
improve your relationship?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.264
>> CAITLYN: I-I don't know.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.832
>> JENNY: You know, most couples

17:12.832 --> 17:14.567
who get divorced, they're...

17:14.567 --> 17:15.735
they're kind of done with each

17:15.735 --> 17:16.736
other.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.106
So I'm more than a little

17:19.106 --> 17:20.240
worried about what's going to

17:20.240 --> 17:21.241
happen.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.710
(Caitlyn sighs)

17:23.710 --> 17:25.678
*

17:28.915 --> 17:30.483
>> KRIS: Okay.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.718
(exhales)

17:31.718 --> 17:34.687
I'm here in New Orleans because

17:34.687 --> 17:36.489
Cait has been a little MIA and

17:36.489 --> 17:39.959
I've heard all about these

17:39.959 --> 17:41.994
shenanigans going on, so I

17:41.994 --> 17:43.296
decided to come out.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.664
I'm looking forward to seeing

17:44.664 --> 17:45.665
what the excitement is all

17:45.665 --> 17:46.666
about.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.934
>> COURTNEY: Are you excited for

17:47.934 --> 17:50.237
Kris to arrive?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.371
>> CAITLYN: Um, yeah.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.505
As a matter of fact, she just

17:52.505 --> 17:54.841
texted me.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.245
She is...

17:58.245 --> 17:59.712
one floor below.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.481
(giggles)

18:01.481 --> 18:02.482
I think I should probably go

18:02.482 --> 18:03.483
down and just say hi.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.484
>> COURTNEY: Of course you

18:04.484 --> 18:05.485
should.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.154
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, break the ice.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.221
>> KRIS: I forgot how pretty New

18:08.221 --> 18:09.656
Orleans was.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.758
>> PRODUCER: Have you and

18:11.758 --> 18:14.161
Caitlyn been on good terms

18:14.161 --> 18:15.895
recently or...?

18:15.895 --> 18:18.831
(both laughing)

18:18.831 --> 18:21.701
>> KRIS: Oh, boy.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.436
>> CAITLYN: A little nervous,

18:23.436 --> 18:25.405
a little nervous.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.978
>> JENNY: Hang on, so, hi.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.180
Welcome once again to another

18:33.180 --> 18:35.715
episode of... I Am Jenny,

18:35.715 --> 18:37.317
the new spin-off show.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.219
>> KRIS: When you talk to

18:39.219 --> 18:41.188
somebody about your view, you

18:41.188 --> 18:42.889
could get a little cranky.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.291
No one wants to sit around and

18:44.291 --> 18:45.392
listen to this (bleep).

18:45.392 --> 18:46.793
So shut the (bleep) up and

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
relax.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.735
>> CAITLYN: A little nervous,

18:55.735 --> 18:57.704
a little nervous.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.343
>> KRIS: Uh...

19:03.343 --> 19:06.112
Coming.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.847
Hello!

19:07.847 --> 19:09.949
Welcome to the view of the

19:09.949 --> 19:11.017
whatever this is.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.018
>> CAITLYN: You got candles?

19:12.018 --> 19:13.019
Wait a second.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.020
>> KRIS: Yeah, it's--

19:14.020 --> 19:15.021
>> CAITLYN: Well, hi there.

19:15.021 --> 19:15.822
Say hi.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.489
>> KRIS: Hi, how are you?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.224
>> CAITLYN: You went basic

19:17.224 --> 19:18.225
brown-- I like that.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.226
>> KRIS: Are you getting taller?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.227
Oh, it must be the heels.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.228
>> CAITLYN: Well, they're not

19:21.228 --> 19:22.229
big heels, yeah.

19:22.229 --> 19:22.929
>> KRIS: Where are all your

19:22.929 --> 19:23.763
girlfriends?

19:23.763 --> 19:24.597
>> CAITLYN: We're gonna meet

19:24.597 --> 19:25.465
everybody tonight.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.333
>> KRIS: Oh, okay, for dinner or

19:26.333 --> 19:27.234
something?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.067
>> CAITLYN: Uh, yeah, we're

19:28.067 --> 19:29.001
gonna go to dinner and then,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.002
uh...

19:30.002 --> 19:31.271
>> KRIS: What does that mean?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.339
What are you--?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
What is this?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.341
>> CAITLYN: Party time!

19:34.341 --> 19:35.342
>> KRIS: Oh, my God, do I need a

19:35.342 --> 19:36.376
nap?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.410
>> CAITLYN: Um...

19:37.410 --> 19:38.411
>> KRIS: For a person who never

19:38.411 --> 19:39.412
stayed up past 9:00?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.413
>> CAITLYN: I know, no.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.414
I, I've been doing--

19:41.414 --> 19:42.415
I know, I know, I know.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.416
>> KRIS: And now you're, now

19:43.416 --> 19:44.417
it's party time?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.151
>> CAITLYN: We have been on the

19:45.151 --> 19:46.018
road for like about a month

19:46.018 --> 19:47.019
right now, I--

19:47.019 --> 19:48.020
>> KRIS: Wow.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.021
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it's been a

19:49.021 --> 19:50.022
long trip.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.090
But I'm very glad you're here.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.325
>> KRIS: We were all wondering

19:52.325 --> 19:53.726
why you were MIA, and we hadn't

19:53.726 --> 19:54.761
heard from you in a bit, so...

19:54.761 --> 19:55.762
>> CAITLYN: Well, I've been on

19:55.762 --> 19:56.763
the road.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.697
>> KRIS: Somebody's got to come

19:57.697 --> 19:58.665
figure this out.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.666
>> CAITLYN: Please do.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.667
>> KRIS: I'm gonna, um, put

20:00.667 --> 20:01.668
some things away.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.602
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.436
>> KRIS: And maybe take a

20:03.436 --> 20:04.437
catnap.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.272
>> CAITLYN: Okay, we'll just

20:05.272 --> 20:06.072
have a quick little glass of

20:06.072 --> 20:06.873
wine, and then, uh, we'll go to

20:06.873 --> 20:07.874
dinner and you'll meet all the

20:07.874 --> 20:08.541
girls-- it'll be fun.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.842
>> KRIS: Okay, oh, I can't wait!

20:09.842 --> 20:11.077
What are you gonna wear, Jenner?

20:11.077 --> 20:12.078
I've got something for you.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.079
>> KRIS: Oh, boy.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.080
I can't wait.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.081
>> CAITLYN: All right.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.082
I'll see you in a bit.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.083
>> KRIS: All right.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.084
>> CAITLYN: Bye.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.085
>> KRIS: Bye.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.086
(chuckles, groans)

20:20.086 --> 20:21.087
(knocking)

20:21.087 --> 20:22.088
>> JENNY: Hello?

20:22.088 --> 20:23.089
>> ELLA: Jenny?

20:23.089 --> 20:24.090
>> JENNY: It's time for Jenny

20:24.090 --> 20:25.191
Boylan cam-- in you go.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.594
>> ELLA: Oh, oh.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.928
>> JENNY: Come a little closer,

20:28.928 --> 20:29.929
you ready?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.564
Hang on, so, hi.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.965
Welcome to once again to another

20:32.965 --> 20:35.034
episode of... I Am Jenny,

20:35.034 --> 20:36.936
the new spin-off show.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.638
We're here with our, with

20:38.638 --> 20:39.939
today's next guest.

20:39.939 --> 20:40.940
>> ELLA: Hello.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.941
>> JENNY: Uh, Ms. Ella Giselle.

20:41.941 --> 20:42.942
>> ELLA: Hi.

20:42.942 --> 20:43.943
>> JENNY: So, Ella, uh, what

20:43.943 --> 20:44.944
would you like to say to your,

20:44.944 --> 20:45.945
to your new, to your people?

20:45.945 --> 20:46.779
>> ELLA: Thank you for

20:46.779 --> 20:47.614
supporting me.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.615
(Jenny snores)

20:48.615 --> 20:49.282
>> JENNY: Oh, I'm sorry.

20:49.282 --> 20:49.949
I just dozed off there

20:49.949 --> 20:50.950
for a second.

20:50.950 --> 20:51.951
What do we not know about you?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.420
>> ELLA: I survive off of one

20:53.420 --> 20:54.587
drink.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.888
Chocolate milk.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.089
>> JENNY: Chocolate milk.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.325
What do you, how do you feel if

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
you can't get chocolate milk?

20:59.526 --> 21:00.560
What happens?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.661
>> ELLA: Um, angry.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.662
>> JENNY: What's the most amount

21:02.662 --> 21:03.663
of chocolate milk you've had in

21:03.663 --> 21:04.664
a single day?

21:04.664 --> 21:05.665
>> ELLA: Six... probably more.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.666
>> JENNY: Six glasses and...

21:06.666 --> 21:07.667
what were you like then?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.336
>> ELLA: Uh...

21:09.336 --> 21:10.903
Not feeling very well.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.038
>> JENNY: Well, you know what?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.039
The first step in solving the

21:13.039 --> 21:14.040
problem is admitting that it is

21:14.040 --> 21:15.342
a problem.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.776
>> ELLA: Is it a problem though?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.144
>> JENNY: Well...

21:18.144 --> 21:19.612
That's about all the time we

21:19.612 --> 21:21.414
have for today on I Am Ella.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.515
>> ELLA: I am Ella.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.750
I like this.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.751
Do I get, like, a deal?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.918
(Jenny laughs)

21:25.918 --> 21:27.554
(knocking)

21:27.554 --> 21:28.688
>> KRIS: You look nice.

21:28.688 --> 21:29.689
>> CAITLYN: Oh, thank you.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.690
I went brown.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.691
>> KRIS: Yeah, well, you

21:31.691 --> 21:32.692
certainly did.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.693
It looks good with your hair.

21:33.693 --> 21:34.694
>> CAITLYN: I know.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.695
>> KRIS: Yeah.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.696
>> CAITLYN: What is that?

21:36.696 --> 21:37.697
>> KRIS: It's a cape.

21:37.697 --> 21:38.998
>> CAITLYN: Cool.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.367
>> PRODUCER: Are there any plans

21:40.367 --> 21:41.368
to throw beads and pull our tops

21:41.368 --> 21:42.669
up tonight?

21:42.669 --> 21:43.703
Isn't that what everyone does in

21:43.703 --> 21:44.704
New Orleans?

21:44.704 --> 21:45.705
>> KRIS: Pull our tops up?

21:45.705 --> 21:46.706
Well, you can pull your top up.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.540
Mine's staying right

21:47.540 --> 21:48.207
where it is.

21:48.207 --> 21:48.975
>> CAITLYN: No, that's okay.

21:48.975 --> 21:49.642
Well, no, yours is staying

21:49.642 --> 21:50.377
where your--?

21:50.377 --> 21:51.043
>> KRIS: Your boobs are a little

21:51.043 --> 21:51.711
fresher than mine.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.445
>> CAITLYN: Mine are staying in

21:52.445 --> 21:53.112
the exactly same place, too.

21:53.112 --> 21:53.780
>> KRIS: You just got

21:53.780 --> 21:54.447
a boob job.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.147
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, maybe throw

21:55.147 --> 21:56.115
some, maybe throw some beads,

21:56.115 --> 21:57.049
beads out or something, but

21:57.049 --> 21:57.784
that's as far as we go.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.618
>> KRIS: No, your boobs are

21:58.618 --> 21:59.386
perky and mine aren't, yeah.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.019
>> CAITLYN: Well, they are,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.020
yeah, okay.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.088
>> KRIS: So let's start there.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.089
>> CAITLYN: I got his number.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.090
>> KRIS: All right, yeah, well,

22:04.090 --> 22:05.091
anyway.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.059
(indistinct chatter)

22:08.428 --> 22:09.462
>> CAITLYN: Oh, girls?

22:09.462 --> 22:10.830
>> KRIS: Hi, I'm Kris.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.964
How are you?

22:11.964 --> 22:12.965
>> CAITLYN: Candis.

22:12.965 --> 22:13.966
>> BOTH: Nice to see you.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.134
>> KRIS: Boy, all this glam--

22:15.134 --> 22:16.769
I love it!

22:16.769 --> 22:18.405
I never thought an evening in

22:18.405 --> 22:20.239
New Orleans would turn out to be

22:20.239 --> 22:22.442
me and a group of transgender

22:22.442 --> 22:24.411
women, but you know what, why

22:24.411 --> 22:25.645
not?

22:25.645 --> 22:26.846
This is so exciting.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.880
>> CAITLYN: These are everybody

22:27.880 --> 22:28.948
that's been on the bus.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.049
Jenny?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.050
>> JENNY: Jenny, I live with my

22:31.050 --> 22:32.652
wife Deirdre.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.720
We have been married for 27

22:33.720 --> 22:35.955
years-- 12 as husband and wife,

22:35.955 --> 22:37.289
and 15 as wife and wife.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.725
>> KRIS: Oh, wow, she's a really

22:38.725 --> 22:40.059
good sport.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.594
I like that. (laughs)

22:41.594 --> 22:42.662
That's amazing.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.830
>> CAITLYN: She's a saint...

22:43.830 --> 22:44.997
>> KRIS: She's a lot better than

22:44.997 --> 22:46.433
I am.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.734
No, I'm kidding.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.268
>> KATE: I thought I saw it all

22:49.268 --> 22:50.770
until I met Caitlyn.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.138
(laughter)

22:52.138 --> 22:53.873
My eyes have been opened.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.041
>> CAITLYN: When you have an,

22:55.041 --> 22:56.443
like an eight-hour bus ride, the

22:56.443 --> 22:57.744
conversation gets very

22:57.744 --> 22:59.111
interesting, doesn't it?

22:59.111 --> 23:01.213
>> KRIS: So, if you spend that

23:01.213 --> 23:03.082
much time with Caitlyn, and you

23:03.082 --> 23:05.351
guys are in a closed quarters--

23:05.351 --> 23:09.321
what is the most annoying thing

23:09.321 --> 23:10.857
about Caitlyn that you could

23:10.857 --> 23:11.858
possibly--?

23:11.858 --> 23:12.859
>> CAITLYN: That I'm a

23:12.859 --> 23:13.860
Republican-- okay, let's get

23:13.860 --> 23:14.861
over it.

23:14.861 --> 23:15.862
>> KRIS: Yeah, politics, right?

23:15.862 --> 23:17.029
Oh, I could relate to that.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.064
>> KATE: For me, it's not that

23:18.064 --> 23:19.932
you are a Republican.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.503
It's how I experience you

23:23.503 --> 23:24.904
expressing your Republican

23:24.904 --> 23:26.338
views.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.607
>> JENNY: Exactly.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.008
>> KRIS: Oh, hallelujah.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.009
>> JENNY: We went to the

23:30.009 --> 23:31.010
Democratic debates in Iowa.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.011
>> KRIS: Oh, boy.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.179
>> CAITLYN: I went and I got a

23:33.179 --> 23:34.180
picture with Hillary Clinton.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.482
>> KRIS: That's awesome.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.483
>> CAITLYN: I know.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.784
>> KRIS: How did that feel?

23:37.784 --> 23:39.486
>> CAITLYN: Um, how did it feel?

23:39.486 --> 23:40.720
Uh, it was good.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.721
She was very nice.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.855
She's a politician.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.290
>> KRIS: Yeah, I know, but

23:44.290 --> 23:45.858
you're not a politician, but you

23:45.858 --> 23:47.126
think you're a politician

23:47.126 --> 23:48.227
sometimes, I think.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.228
>> CAITLYN: That, I-I-I-I enjoy

23:49.228 --> 23:50.229
politics.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.230
>> JENNY: I am just gonna sit

23:51.230 --> 23:52.231
back.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.033
>> CAITLYN: I-I enjoy politics.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.201
>> KRIS: Yeah, you do, but

23:55.201 --> 23:56.736
sometimes, sometimes when you

23:56.736 --> 23:58.638
talk to somebody about your

23:58.638 --> 24:00.507
view, not everybody's gonna

24:00.507 --> 24:02.742
always agree.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.678
And sometimes, you could get a

24:05.678 --> 24:06.946
little cranky.

24:06.946 --> 24:07.947
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I agree, I

24:07.947 --> 24:08.948
agree.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.949
>> KRIS: But because you're so,

24:09.949 --> 24:10.950
um...

24:10.950 --> 24:11.951
>> CAITLYN: I, I get it.

24:11.951 --> 24:12.952
>> KRIS: ...crazy about this one

24:12.952 --> 24:14.521
thing-- you are really crazy

24:14.521 --> 24:15.655
about this one thing, and no one

24:15.655 --> 24:16.856
wants to sit around and listen

24:16.856 --> 24:18.057
to this (bleep) so shut the

24:18.057 --> 24:20.359
(bleep) up and relax!

24:20.359 --> 24:23.195
(laughter)

24:23.195 --> 24:24.664
I can't wait to see you guys

24:24.664 --> 24:25.832
again.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.999
Not you, Jenner, just your

24:26.999 --> 24:28.668
friends.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.136
Don't get excited!

24:30.136 --> 24:31.571
(all cheering)

24:31.571 --> 24:33.072
>> JENNY: Did she tell you early

24:33.072 --> 24:34.173
on?

24:34.173 --> 24:35.174
>> KRIS: No.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.175
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.176
>> KRIS: There was no "I am

24:37.176 --> 24:38.177
transgender."

24:38.177 --> 24:39.211
>> CAITLYN: I certainly told her

24:39.211 --> 24:41.180
what was going on.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.650
>> KRIS: I just have to share

24:43.650 --> 24:45.151
one story that when it got

24:45.151 --> 24:46.953
really crazy-- when I met Bruce,

24:46.953 --> 24:50.189
there was no politics ever.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.290
And then it just got a little

24:51.290 --> 24:52.291
bit more...

24:52.291 --> 24:53.292
>> CAITLYN: They're learning way

24:53.292 --> 24:54.293
too much about me.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.294
>> KRIS: ...and a little bit

24:55.294 --> 24:56.295
more and a little bit more, and

24:56.295 --> 24:57.997
over the years, someone got very

24:57.997 --> 25:00.166
upset some certain person was

25:00.166 --> 25:02.468
president of the United States.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.803
>> CHANDI: Uh-huh?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.805
>> KRIS: And would wake me up

25:05.805 --> 25:07.239
at like 5:00 in the morning so

25:07.239 --> 25:09.275
upset and realizing that I was

25:09.275 --> 25:12.645
maybe on somebody else's side.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.847
And, but I really, I'm kind of

25:14.847 --> 25:15.848
neutral.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.849
I just go with what I-I--

25:16.849 --> 25:17.850
>> CAITLYN: You're giving away

25:17.850 --> 25:18.851
all of my secrets.

25:18.851 --> 25:19.852
>> KRIS: I'm sorry.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.853
>> CANDIS: I love it!

25:20.853 --> 25:21.854
>> CHANDI: A lot of people are

25:21.854 --> 25:23.690
having a hard time trying to

25:23.690 --> 25:25.324
figure out how Caitlyn can be a

25:25.324 --> 25:27.694
Republican when, in most cases,

25:27.694 --> 25:29.095
Republicans really don't support

25:29.095 --> 25:30.129
our community.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.163
>> KRIS: Yeah.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.364
>> CHANDI: But we've had to

25:32.364 --> 25:33.966
listen to the things that Cait

25:33.966 --> 25:35.668
has had to say.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.669
There's work in both areas that

25:36.669 --> 25:37.670
need to be, that need to be

25:37.670 --> 25:38.671
done.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.672
>> CAITLYN: It's an

25:39.672 --> 25:40.673
educational experience.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.674
>> KRIS: But you're unwilling,

25:41.674 --> 25:42.374
I think at times...

25:42.374 --> 25:43.375
>> CHANDI: Yes! (laughs)

25:43.375 --> 25:44.376
>> KRIS: ...to listen to

25:44.376 --> 25:45.377
somebody else's view and meet in

25:45.377 --> 25:46.378
the middle.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.413
>> CAITLYN: No, I-- don't, don't

25:47.413 --> 25:49.081
don't everybody start agreeing

25:49.081 --> 25:50.449
with her!

25:50.449 --> 25:51.684
>> KATE: Well, part of the issue

25:51.684 --> 25:53.485
has been that we outnumber

25:53.485 --> 25:55.521
Caitlyn on the bus, and we just

25:55.521 --> 25:59.491
don't want to end up bullying

25:59.491 --> 26:01.127
her or putting her on the

26:01.127 --> 26:02.895
defensive.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.296
>> KRIS: Take it from me, who

26:04.296 --> 26:06.498
was one person with one person.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.167
>> CAITLYN: 23 years.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.535
>> KRIS: You need that many

26:09.535 --> 26:11.470
people against that with this

26:11.470 --> 26:13.940
subject matter.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.775
Trust me, you guys are gonna be

26:15.775 --> 26:17.209
just fine, but you need--

26:17.209 --> 26:18.210
>> CAITLYN: I think we need,

26:18.210 --> 26:19.445
need to go to dinner.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.247
Is it time to go to dinner?

26:21.247 --> 26:22.348
>> KATE: God bless America,

26:22.348 --> 26:23.850
let's go to dinner!

26:23.850 --> 26:25.317
>> CAITLYN: I have to admit it

26:25.317 --> 26:26.819
is kind of hard to listen to all

26:26.819 --> 26:28.120
these people in the room come up

26:28.120 --> 26:29.656
with their notes on me-- their

26:29.656 --> 26:32.058
likes and dislikes, okay?

26:32.058 --> 26:33.693
I got my ex-wife and my friends

26:33.693 --> 26:35.261
all comparing notes.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.663
Not easy.

26:36.663 --> 26:37.764
I don't think I'm gonna come out

26:37.764 --> 26:39.732
of this, you know, very good.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.670
>> CANDIS: That's really nice of

26:43.670 --> 26:44.470
you to come and, like, meet all

26:44.470 --> 26:45.237
of us.

26:45.237 --> 26:45.938
>> KRIS: I wanted to see what

26:45.938 --> 26:46.906
was going on out here.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.040
He was a little... she was a

26:48.040 --> 26:49.676
little MIA.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.409
>> CAITLYN: Who?

26:50.409 --> 26:51.110
>> KRIS: You.

26:51.110 --> 26:51.844
>> CAITLYN: Where did you get

26:51.844 --> 26:52.845
those earrings?

26:52.845 --> 26:54.146
I don't remember them in the old

26:54.146 --> 26:55.447
days, when I used to steal your

26:55.447 --> 26:56.382
earrings.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.684
(Candis laughs)

26:57.684 --> 26:59.719
>> KRIS: These are Cartier, and

26:59.719 --> 27:00.687
you would have been in big

27:00.687 --> 27:01.520
trouble.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.388
>> CAITLYN: Oh, okay.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.189
(laughter)

27:03.189 --> 27:04.023
What else is new?

27:04.023 --> 27:04.824
I was in big trouble all the

27:04.824 --> 27:05.892
time anyway.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.126
>> KRIS: You know what we found?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.895
You stole the key to my closet

27:08.895 --> 27:10.062
and you hid it.

27:10.062 --> 27:10.830
>> CAITLYN: I thought I hid it

27:10.830 --> 27:11.563
so well.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.199
>> KRIS: Yeah, we... I found it.

27:13.199 --> 27:13.866
>> CAITLYN: Really?

27:13.866 --> 27:14.867
>> KRIS: Yeah, that was very

27:14.867 --> 27:15.702
tricky, Jenner.

27:15.702 --> 27:16.836
>> CAITLYN: I know, it was good.

27:16.836 --> 27:17.569
>> KRIS: Yeah.

27:17.569 --> 27:18.404
(Candis laughs)

27:18.404 --> 27:19.706
>> CAITLYN: It was good.

27:19.706 --> 27:20.707
I had to steal yours, go get it

27:20.707 --> 27:22.241
made and then...

27:22.241 --> 27:23.409
>> KRIS (laughing): You had one

27:23.409 --> 27:24.711
made?

27:24.711 --> 27:25.912
>> CAITLYN: Had one made, yeah.

27:25.912 --> 27:26.779
>> CANDIS: Oh!

27:26.779 --> 27:28.047
It's nice that you guys are

27:28.047 --> 27:29.749
laughing and are together as

27:29.749 --> 27:31.851
friends.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.085
It's a really good thing.

27:33.085 --> 27:33.886
>> KRIS: I'm going to kill him

27:33.886 --> 27:34.553
after dinner.

27:34.553 --> 27:35.321
(Candis laughs)

27:35.321 --> 27:35.988
>> CAITLYN: Right.

27:35.988 --> 27:36.723
You'll kill her.

27:36.723 --> 27:37.389
>> KRIS: Kill her after dinner,

27:37.389 --> 27:38.057
sorry.

27:38.057 --> 27:38.725
>> CAITLYN: Right.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.425
>> KRIS: Got to keep correcting

27:39.425 --> 27:41.928
me.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.229
>> CAITLYN: I certainly said I

27:43.229 --> 27:44.263
had gender issues.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.431
>> KRIS: I didn't know.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.298
Until all of this, I couldn't

27:46.298 --> 27:47.333
have given you the definition of

27:47.333 --> 27:48.000
"transgender."

27:48.000 --> 27:48.735
>> CAITLYN: Let me finish.

27:48.735 --> 27:49.401
>> KRIS: Okay, you're being

27:49.401 --> 27:51.370
stubborn; that's fine.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.942
(indistinct conversations)

27:55.942 --> 27:57.209
>> KRIS: I'm gonna have that.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.077
>> CANDIS: You have a black

27:58.077 --> 27:58.878
napkin?

27:58.878 --> 27:59.879
(laughs)

27:59.879 --> 28:00.913
>> JENNY: What napkin goes best

28:00.913 --> 28:01.848
with your clothes?

28:01.848 --> 28:03.082
>> CANDIS: Yes, of course.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.050
>> JENNY: Candis Cayne...

28:04.050 --> 28:05.117
(Kris laughs)

28:05.117 --> 28:06.385
Although I've got this unsightly

28:06.385 --> 28:07.486
white napkin.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.654
(Candis laughs)

28:08.654 --> 28:09.756
May I have a black napkin also,

28:09.756 --> 28:10.389
please?

28:10.389 --> 28:11.223
>> WAITER: How many more black

28:11.223 --> 28:11.958
napkins?

28:11.958 --> 28:12.759
>> JENNY: I think it's just the

28:12.759 --> 28:13.425
two of us.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.226
(laughter)

28:14.226 --> 28:15.061
>> CAITLYN: That's amazing, that

28:15.061 --> 28:16.495
you've gotten to the point where

28:16.495 --> 28:18.530
you want a matching napkin to

28:18.530 --> 28:19.465
your outfit.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.166
>> JENNY: Oh, yeah.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.000
>> CAITLYN: We have so gotten

28:21.000 --> 28:22.268
you out of the woods of Maine.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.602
>> JENNY: So Caitlyn's been out

28:23.602 --> 28:24.403
for six months now... six

28:24.403 --> 28:25.071
months?

28:25.071 --> 28:25.872
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.

28:25.872 --> 28:26.773
>> JENNY: Where are you now as

28:26.773 --> 28:27.639
opposed to where you were six

28:27.639 --> 28:28.574
months ago?

28:28.574 --> 28:30.342
>> KRIS: Probably more tolerant

28:30.342 --> 28:31.844
and I have more acceptance and

28:31.844 --> 28:33.179
probably understand it a little

28:33.179 --> 28:34.013
bit more.

28:34.013 --> 28:34.914
>> JENNY: But did it... did you

28:34.914 --> 28:35.614
take it per...

28:35.614 --> 28:36.783
I mean, I know, speaking from

28:36.783 --> 28:38.350
personal experience, my wife...

28:38.350 --> 28:39.618
my wife, I think, in some ways

28:39.618 --> 28:41.053
took it personally when I first

28:41.053 --> 28:41.854
came out.

28:41.854 --> 28:42.654
>> KRIS: I definitely took it

28:42.654 --> 28:44.924
personally.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.292
>> JENNY: I think she felt like,

28:46.292 --> 28:47.659
"Wait, I wasn't enough?"

28:47.659 --> 28:50.229
>> KRIS: No, I feel like she was

28:50.229 --> 28:51.430
very unhappy.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.799
Very, very unhappy for a very

28:52.799 --> 28:54.100
long time.

28:54.100 --> 28:54.867
>> CAITLYN: I was surviving, but

28:54.867 --> 28:55.802
I was...

28:55.802 --> 28:56.668
>> KRIS: Yeah.

28:56.668 --> 28:57.436
>> CAITLYN: ...dealing with a

28:57.436 --> 28:58.237
lot of things.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.071
>> KRIS: Forever.

28:59.071 --> 28:59.872
>> JENNY: So when you look at

28:59.872 --> 29:01.640
her, do you see Caitlyn?

29:01.640 --> 29:02.708
Or do you see the person that

29:02.708 --> 29:06.345
she was?

29:06.345 --> 29:07.947
>> KRIS: I see great eyebrows...

29:07.947 --> 29:09.148
(laughter)

29:09.148 --> 29:10.582
...and high cheekbones.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.084
No, I see the present.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.820
I can't see Bruce in this, right

29:13.820 --> 29:16.688
now.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.425
But I have memories of that.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.326
>> CAITLYN: It's a million miles

29:20.326 --> 29:21.127
away.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.194
>> KRIS: Yeah.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.529
So I don't see that anymore.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.864
You just get used to it, it's

29:24.864 --> 29:25.932
weird, you just see...

29:25.932 --> 29:26.833
>> JENNY: The new normal.

29:26.833 --> 29:27.633
>> KRIS: Yeah.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.400
How old were you when you

29:28.400 --> 29:30.102
realized that you were

29:30.102 --> 29:31.370
transgender?

29:31.370 --> 29:32.204
>> JENNY: I knew I was trans

29:32.204 --> 29:33.105
from a very early age.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.874
Four, five, six.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.842
It's one of my earliest

29:35.842 --> 29:36.843
memories.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.845
And I tried everything I could

29:38.845 --> 29:40.246
to make the boy thing work.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.113
You come out when you're ready

29:41.113 --> 29:42.181
to come out.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.115
>> KRIS: So, wait, so I have a

29:43.115 --> 29:45.084
question, but with no

29:45.084 --> 29:46.352
disrespect.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.386
So I just really want to know

29:47.386 --> 29:48.554
this.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.355
>> CHANDI: How else will you

29:49.355 --> 29:50.456
know if you don't ask?

29:50.456 --> 29:51.958
>> KRIS: No, but... so if you're

29:51.958 --> 29:54.293
trans... a transgender woman...

29:54.293 --> 29:56.128
what do you do with the bits and

29:56.128 --> 29:58.697
pieces that are below the belt?

29:58.697 --> 30:01.400
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God!

30:01.400 --> 30:02.869
>> KRIS: People wonder, when

30:02.869 --> 30:04.736
they look at somebody.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.673
I seriously want to know.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.508
I mean, you know, Caitlyn...

30:09.508 --> 30:10.176
>> CAITLYN: I know.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.077
>> KRIS: ...but they are asking

30:11.077 --> 30:15.014
the question like that.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.983
Am I getting way too crazy?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.321
>> JENNY: If you knew ten years

30:22.321 --> 30:23.622
ago what you know now... do you

30:23.622 --> 30:24.991
think you would still be

30:24.991 --> 30:28.260
married?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.695
>> CAITLYN: There's one more

30:29.695 --> 30:31.430
thing I really need to do before

30:31.430 --> 30:33.399
she leaves: have a one-on-one

30:33.399 --> 30:34.800
conversation with her.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.268
Because I-I feel like I have a

30:36.268 --> 30:37.269
lot to say to her.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.670
(knocking gently)

30:38.670 --> 30:40.639
>> KRIS: Coming.

30:41.941 --> 30:42.741
>> KRIS: People wonder, when

30:42.741 --> 30:44.310
they look at somebody and they

30:44.310 --> 30:45.644
say, okay, well, what happens

30:45.644 --> 30:46.913
to, like...

30:46.913 --> 30:49.381
I seriously want to know.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.117
I mean, you know, Caitlyn...

30:51.117 --> 30:51.850
>> CAITLYN: I know.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.718
>> KRIS: ...but they are asking

30:52.718 --> 30:54.120
the question like that.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.554
Am I getting way too crazy?

30:55.554 --> 30:56.956
(talking over each other)

30:56.956 --> 30:57.723
>> KRIS: I mean, I'm sorry.

30:57.723 --> 30:58.757
I just wondered, like, what...

30:58.757 --> 30:59.425
Does everybody do the same

30:59.425 --> 30:59.926
thing?

30:59.926 --> 31:00.692
>> CHANDI: I'll help you out.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.193
>> KATE: Okay.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.061
>> CAITLYN: You're sitting next

31:02.061 --> 31:02.728
to Kate. There you go.

31:02.728 --> 31:03.395
Listen to Kate.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.396
>> KRIS: Okay. All right.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.264
>> KATE: It used to be

31:05.264 --> 31:07.799
understood that if you have a

31:07.799 --> 31:10.236
penis, you're a man.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.704
If you have a vulva and vagina,

31:12.704 --> 31:14.173
you're a woman.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.842
Genitals really have very little

31:16.842 --> 31:17.944
to do with who you think you

31:17.944 --> 31:19.011
are.

31:19.011 --> 31:19.678
>> KRIS: Inside.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.346
>> KATE: Yeah.

31:20.346 --> 31:21.047
>> KRIS: Okay.

31:21.047 --> 31:21.713
>> KATE: So...

31:21.713 --> 31:22.581
>> KRIS: That makes sense.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.515
>> KATE: ...it really doesn't

31:23.515 --> 31:25.317
matter what a person has down

31:25.317 --> 31:26.518
there.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.686
You're still interested.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.988
>> KRIS: It does to me.

31:28.988 --> 31:29.788
No, I'm kidding.

31:29.788 --> 31:30.556
>> KATE: It does to you, and

31:30.556 --> 31:31.290
because you're so close...

31:31.290 --> 31:32.358
>> KRIS: No, no, I mean, no, but

31:32.358 --> 31:33.459
it's the, it's the... I think

31:33.459 --> 31:35.461
the knee-jerk curiosity of...

31:35.461 --> 31:36.528
>> CHANDI: Well, can I tell you

31:36.528 --> 31:37.563
something first?

31:37.563 --> 31:38.497
>> KRIS: Yes.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.398
>> CHANDI: All trans people

31:39.398 --> 31:40.699
don't choose to do that.

31:40.699 --> 31:41.467
>> KATE: Exactly.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.201
>> CHANDI: And that's the

31:42.201 --> 31:43.735
important thing for... for us to

31:43.735 --> 31:44.836
be able to share with someone

31:44.836 --> 31:46.205
who is an ally.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.240
>> KRIS: So every person decides

31:48.240 --> 31:49.976
what's best for them.

31:49.976 --> 31:50.977
>> KATE: That's right.

31:50.977 --> 31:51.777
>> KRIS: ...for... like a

31:51.777 --> 31:52.578
case-by-case.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.379
Okay, got it.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.313
>> JENNY: Having been married

31:54.313 --> 31:55.147
those 23 years...

31:55.147 --> 31:56.048
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.

31:56.048 --> 31:56.882
>> JENNY: ...now that she has

31:56.882 --> 31:58.985
done the presto-change-o, does

31:58.985 --> 32:00.352
it in any way make you question

32:00.352 --> 32:02.388
yourself and who you were during

32:02.388 --> 32:04.490
that time?

32:04.490 --> 32:05.992
>> KRIS: No.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.393
I don't know why, but it

32:07.393 --> 32:08.327
doesn't.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.328
>> JENNY: She tell you early on?

32:09.328 --> 32:10.429
>> KRIS: No.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.430
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.264
>> KRIS: She keeps saying she

32:12.264 --> 32:13.099
told me, but she didn't.

32:13.099 --> 32:13.899
(Chandi laughs)

32:13.899 --> 32:14.733
I think what happened was...

32:14.733 --> 32:15.534
>> JENNY: This is what I want to

32:15.534 --> 32:16.335
know about.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.469
>> KRIS: ...a conversation in a

32:17.469 --> 32:18.537
driveway.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.439
He says to me, "Do you ever want

32:20.439 --> 32:21.540
to have more kids?"

32:21.540 --> 32:23.142
And I said, "Oh, God, no."

32:23.142 --> 32:24.810
So he says, "Oh, neither do I.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.545
That's, like, that's great.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.479
And I couldn't have any more

32:27.479 --> 32:28.814
kids if I wanted to."

32:28.814 --> 32:31.417
And I went, "Wait. What?"

32:31.417 --> 32:34.153
And he goes, "Oh, geez, you

32:34.153 --> 32:35.887
know, back in the '80s, I messed

32:35.887 --> 32:37.589
around with this or that and it

32:37.589 --> 32:38.624
kind of screwed up my sperm

32:38.624 --> 32:39.825
count and, you know, but

32:39.825 --> 32:40.859
whatever..."

32:40.859 --> 32:42.228
It could've been, like, steroids

32:42.228 --> 32:43.195
for all I knew, 'cause he was an

32:43.195 --> 32:44.096
athlete.

32:44.096 --> 32:44.896
Never said estrogen, never

32:44.896 --> 32:45.664
said...

32:45.664 --> 32:46.665
He just said, "I took some

32:46.665 --> 32:47.599
(bleep) in the '80s..."

32:47.599 --> 32:48.500
>> JENNY: "Some (bleep)"?

32:48.500 --> 32:49.935
>> KRIS: I mean, whatever word.

32:49.935 --> 32:52.104
There was no "I am transgender."

32:52.104 --> 32:53.905
It was "I took some stuff in the

32:53.905 --> 32:56.908
'80s and my sperm isn't good."

32:56.908 --> 32:57.909
>> CAITLYN: I said I had a

32:57.909 --> 33:00.379
condition that I had been

33:00.379 --> 33:02.248
dealing with forever.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.850
I said that I was on hormones

33:04.850 --> 33:06.652
and that's the reason it might

33:06.652 --> 33:08.654
be tough to get pregnant.

33:08.654 --> 33:09.655
>> KRIS: And my friends said,

33:09.655 --> 33:10.656
"Have a bottle of wine and go

33:10.656 --> 33:12.424
have great sex."

33:12.424 --> 33:13.459
And we did, and we had Kendall.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.560
And then a minute later, we had

33:14.560 --> 33:15.561
Kylie.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.063
But none of that was "I want to

33:17.063 --> 33:18.364
be a woman."

33:18.364 --> 33:19.431
>> CAITLYN: I certainly told her

33:19.431 --> 33:21.067
what was going on.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.635
My version of what happened at

33:23.635 --> 33:25.237
the beginning is obviously very

33:25.237 --> 33:27.706
different than her version.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.075
I certainly said I had gender

33:29.075 --> 33:30.476
issues and that I was on

33:30.476 --> 33:32.111
hormones and, you know, I had

33:32.111 --> 33:34.280
boobs and, you know, the whole

33:34.280 --> 33:35.747
thing.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.383
>> KRIS: You didn't have boobs.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.085
I didn't know until all of this.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.086
I couldn't have given you the

33:40.086 --> 33:41.087
definition of "transgender"...

33:41.087 --> 33:42.088
>> CAITLYN: Let me finish.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.089
>> KRIS: ...until six months

33:43.089 --> 33:44.090
ago.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.091
>> CAITLYN: Let me finish.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.092
>> KRIS: Okay, you're being

33:46.092 --> 33:47.093
stubborn. That's fine.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.094
>> JENNY: I don't know that Kris

33:48.094 --> 33:49.528
and Caitlyn have ever really had

33:49.528 --> 33:50.962
this conversation.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.232
It may be that Caitlyn really

33:53.232 --> 33:56.102
did tell Kris and Kris just

33:56.102 --> 33:58.404
didn't want to hear it.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.306
It might also be that Caitlyn

34:00.306 --> 34:02.974
didn't say anything.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.376
I-I've seen Caitlyn do this.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.112
She says, like, one little

34:06.112 --> 34:07.579
thing, and then it's like, "Oh,

34:07.579 --> 34:08.580
we're all done!

34:08.580 --> 34:09.581
There. Thank goodness that's all

34:09.581 --> 34:10.582
over and now we can go do

34:10.582 --> 34:11.583
something else."

34:11.583 --> 34:13.185
I think I spilled the beans with

34:13.185 --> 34:15.754
my wife a half a dozen times.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.022
We had the big talk.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.023
And the very next time we talked

34:18.023 --> 34:19.225
about it, she was like, "What?"

34:19.225 --> 34:20.692
And then, you know, a little

34:20.692 --> 34:21.693
while would go by and I would...

34:21.693 --> 34:22.694
the next time would come around

34:22.694 --> 34:23.695
and I'd say, "Remember when I

34:23.695 --> 34:24.830
was talking about the whole

34:24.830 --> 34:25.831
transgender thing?"

34:25.831 --> 34:26.965
And she was like, "The what?"

34:26.965 --> 34:28.200
Maybe we're not being clear.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.201
Maybe we're just kind of

34:29.201 --> 34:30.202
mumbling in a kind of a...

34:30.202 --> 34:31.203
(mumbles)

34:31.203 --> 34:32.204
>> KRIS: Maybe you're doing it

34:32.204 --> 34:33.272
in your sleep or something.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.440
>> JENNY: But our loved ones

34:34.440 --> 34:36.041
also, to be fair, don't want to

34:36.041 --> 34:39.278
hear it.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.546
>> KRIS: Well, I think with

34:40.546 --> 34:42.013
Caitlyn, I kept saying, "Why are

34:42.013 --> 34:44.416
you so... unhappy?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.484
Like, what's going on?"

34:45.484 --> 34:46.685
I would sit you down on the

34:46.685 --> 34:48.019
couch in the bedroom and go,

34:48.019 --> 34:49.821
"Tell me what's wrong.

34:49.821 --> 34:50.922
There's something really wrong.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.923
I can handle it.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.492
Just tell me. Just please tell

34:53.492 --> 34:54.526
me."

34:54.526 --> 34:55.561
And she would say, "You wouldn't

34:55.561 --> 34:56.695
understand.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.063
You just won't... you just

34:58.063 --> 34:59.064
wouldn't under..."

34:59.064 --> 35:00.065
"Well, try me."

35:00.065 --> 35:01.233
"No, you're just not that kind

35:01.233 --> 35:02.734
of a person."

35:02.734 --> 35:04.336
You know. So it was this back

35:04.336 --> 35:06.205
and forth for a long time.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.206
>> JENNY: You have two people

35:07.206 --> 35:08.707
who are not communicating on,

35:08.707 --> 35:11.076
oddly... (stammers) and

35:11.076 --> 35:12.077
tragically, what's actually the

35:12.077 --> 35:13.078
most important thing in their

35:13.078 --> 35:14.180
lives.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.182
The reason I didn't tell my wife

35:16.182 --> 35:18.250
before we got married was

35:18.250 --> 35:19.951
because I wanted to protect the

35:19.951 --> 35:21.387
people that I loved.

35:21.387 --> 35:24.456
I didn't want to cause harm to

35:24.456 --> 35:25.524
the people that I loved.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.592
I didn't want to be a source of

35:26.592 --> 35:27.626
trouble.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.794
I wanted to protect them.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.929
I wanted to stand between them

35:30.929 --> 35:31.930
and the trouble of the world.

35:31.930 --> 35:32.931
>> CAITLYN: And that's exactly

35:32.931 --> 35:33.932
where I was.

35:33.932 --> 35:34.933
>> KRIS: Protecting everybody,

35:34.933 --> 35:35.934
yeah.

35:35.934 --> 35:36.902
>> CAITLYN: I never wanted to

35:36.902 --> 35:37.903
hurt anybody.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.004
>> JENNY: If you knew ten years

35:39.004 --> 35:40.806
ago what you know now, do you

35:40.806 --> 35:41.873
think you would still be

35:41.873 --> 35:42.874
married?

35:42.874 --> 35:43.875
>> KRIS: I don't know.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.876
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, good question.

35:44.876 --> 35:45.911
>> KRIS: That's a really good

35:45.911 --> 35:46.912
question.

35:46.912 --> 35:47.913
>> MAN: Ma'am, your entre.

35:47.913 --> 35:48.947
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.316
>> KRIS: I probably would have

35:50.316 --> 35:51.683
turned into the world's greatest

35:51.683 --> 35:52.684
best friend.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.819
>> JENNY: Is it too late for you

35:53.819 --> 35:54.820
to be the world's best friend?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.988
>> KRIS: No. Never.

35:56.988 --> 35:57.989
>> JENNY: Good.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.358
The bottom line for Kris and

35:59.358 --> 36:01.327
Caitlyn to be able to move

36:01.327 --> 36:05.231
forward is forgiveness, and

36:05.231 --> 36:06.932
forgiveness is no small thing.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.867
It's clear to me, even now, they

36:08.867 --> 36:11.237
have a relationship that goes

36:11.237 --> 36:13.038
very deep.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.240
It sure feels to me like they

36:14.240 --> 36:15.574
are going to be part of each

36:15.574 --> 36:17.008
other's lives for the long term,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.077
but they each have work to do if

36:19.077 --> 36:20.479
that's gonna be true.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.613
>> CANDIS: You've decided to

36:21.613 --> 36:23.749
change your life to-to truly

36:23.749 --> 36:25.150
honor who you are as a human

36:25.150 --> 36:27.486
being, and have your kids stand

36:27.486 --> 36:29.054
by your side, and have your

36:29.054 --> 36:32.057
ex-wife-- which is super rare--

36:32.057 --> 36:33.058
to be here...

36:33.058 --> 36:34.059
>> JENNY: It's amazing.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.060
>> CANDIS: ...but with all us,

36:35.060 --> 36:36.061
your girlfriends, so I think we

36:36.061 --> 36:37.062
all have to do a toast.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.063
>> CHANDI: We should.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.064
>> KRIS: Oh!

36:39.064 --> 36:40.065
>> CAITLYN: Okay, great.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.066
>> JENNY: Let's do it to Kris

36:41.066 --> 36:42.067
Jenner.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.068
>> CANDIS: To Caitlyn.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.069
>> KRIS: Caitlyn.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.070
>> CANDIS: And to Kris.

36:45.070 --> 36:45.937
>> KRIS: Oh, no, no, no.

36:45.937 --> 36:46.938
>> KATE: And to Kris.

36:46.938 --> 36:47.939
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

36:47.939 --> 36:48.840
>> KRIS: Thanks, guys.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.675
>> CHANDI: To the new normal.

36:49.675 --> 36:50.676
>> CANDIS: To the modern family.

36:50.676 --> 36:51.677
>> PAM: Cheers.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.779
>> CAITLYN: Yes. I love that.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.881
(crowd chatter)

36:55.881 --> 36:56.848
>> MAN: Good evening, ladies.

36:56.848 --> 36:57.849
>> CANDIS: Good evening.

36:57.849 --> 36:58.850
>> CAITLYN: We are doing it in

36:58.850 --> 36:59.851
New Orleans.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.821
This is Bourbon Street, baby.

37:02.821 --> 37:06.392
*

37:06.392 --> 37:07.393
>> COURTNEY: This is Bourbon?

37:07.393 --> 37:08.394
>> KIP: Yeah.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.295
>> COURTNEY: I've never been

37:09.295 --> 37:10.296
here. I love it!

37:10.296 --> 37:11.297
>> CAITLYN: Doesn't help, if you

37:11.297 --> 37:12.298
try to stay inconspicuous, with

37:12.298 --> 37:13.299
a camera.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.300
They're everywhere.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.301
>> CANDIS: Oh, but they can't

37:15.301 --> 37:16.302
see your face so that's good.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.304
>> CAITLYN: I know.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.305
*

37:19.305 --> 37:20.839
(crowd chatter)

37:20.839 --> 37:24.009
*

37:31.417 --> 37:32.418
>> KIP: They would make a really

37:32.418 --> 37:33.419
hot lesbian couple.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.387
>> CANDIS: They would.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.056
(song ends)

37:38.056 --> 37:39.057
(applause and cheering)

37:39.057 --> 37:41.693
>> CANDIS: Chandi!

37:41.693 --> 37:42.694
>> COURTNEY: Jenny is up there,

37:42.694 --> 37:44.663
too.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.632
*

37:50.168 --> 37:51.236
>> CHANDI: Never in a million

37:51.236 --> 37:52.904
years would I think going out on

37:52.904 --> 37:54.005
the dance floor to dance with

37:54.005 --> 37:55.006
Jenny Boylan.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.908
That's being checked off my

37:56.908 --> 37:57.909
bucket list.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.044
Jenny Boylan was feeling

37:59.044 --> 38:00.245
herself.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.648
Oh, she was feeling herself.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.650
(crowd chatter)

38:04.650 --> 38:06.785
*

38:13.191 --> 38:14.493
>> KRIS: I'm so happy that you

38:14.493 --> 38:16.161
guys are a great group of

38:16.161 --> 38:17.162
girls.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.163
Really cool.

38:18.163 --> 38:20.732
I'm glad I came and I got to see

38:20.732 --> 38:22.000
and meet you guys.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.369
It's so awesome.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.836
>> CANDIS: I'm glad you came.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.372
It means a lot to us and to

38:26.372 --> 38:27.373
Caitlyn.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.374
>> KRIS: Oh.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.408
>> CANDIS: I know she doesn't

38:29.408 --> 38:31.242
say it sometimes, but, um, I

38:31.242 --> 38:34.646
know you mean the world to her.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.047
>> KRIS: I'm glad she has all

38:36.047 --> 38:37.383
you guys as her friends.

38:37.383 --> 38:40.285
Honest to God, it means so much.

38:40.285 --> 38:42.454
*

38:42.454 --> 38:43.455
>> KRIS: What I've witnessed

38:43.455 --> 38:46.091
here tonight firsthand, I never

38:46.091 --> 38:47.125
would have imagined that she

38:47.125 --> 38:48.527
could experience this kind of

38:48.527 --> 38:51.430
friendship and happiness.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.532
And I think that that's what

38:53.532 --> 38:54.800
it... life is all about.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.402
Life is really short, and I

38:56.402 --> 38:57.603
think that you have to go out

38:57.603 --> 39:00.238
and grab your true purpose, and

39:00.238 --> 39:01.740
I think that she's well on her

39:01.740 --> 39:02.808
way.

39:02.808 --> 39:03.809
Cheers!

39:03.809 --> 39:04.810
>> CANDIS: Cheers!

39:04.810 --> 39:05.811
Great to meet you!

39:05.811 --> 39:07.779
>> KRIS: Great night. You, too.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.450
>> CANDIS: We have beads to

39:11.450 --> 39:12.451
throw.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.452
>> COURTNEY: Just keep your

39:13.452 --> 39:14.553
shirt on.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.622
>> CAITLYN: My people! Oh!

39:16.622 --> 39:19.591
(whooping)

39:19.591 --> 39:22.060
>> KRIS: Oh, you got it, baby.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.795
(whooping)

39:23.795 --> 39:24.796
>> KIP: Yes!

39:24.796 --> 39:26.765
(whooping and hooting)

39:26.765 --> 39:28.667
>> KRIS: Yeah!

39:28.667 --> 39:31.336
Kim was telling me that she had

39:31.336 --> 39:32.804
asked you a question about,

39:32.804 --> 39:34.940
like, do you want to date a guy

39:34.940 --> 39:35.941
or a girl.

39:35.941 --> 39:36.942
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

39:36.942 --> 39:37.943
That's...

39:37.943 --> 39:38.777
Right now, I'm just trying to

39:38.777 --> 39:39.778
figure myself out.

39:39.778 --> 39:40.779
>> KRIS: She told me that you

39:40.779 --> 39:41.780
said, "a guy."

39:41.780 --> 39:42.781
>> MAN: Kris Jenner!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.149
>> CAITLYN: If I... if I went

39:44.149 --> 39:45.951
through with my final surgery

39:45.951 --> 39:47.118
and all of that.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.119
>> KRIS: What?

39:48.119 --> 39:49.154
>> MAN: Yo, Kris!

39:49.154 --> 39:50.155
>> KRIS: Aah!

39:50.155 --> 39:51.156
>> CAITLYN: Hit 'em.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.157
I wouldn't date a guy with...

39:52.157 --> 39:53.158
>> MAN: Yo, Kris!

39:53.158 --> 39:54.159
>> KRIS: Really?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.894
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

39:55.894 --> 39:56.895
>> KRIS: You can go out for a

39:56.895 --> 39:57.896
drink.

39:57.896 --> 39:58.897
You don't have to have sex.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.898
>> CAITLYN: I know.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.266
All the way to there.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.267
Here we go.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.435
(whooping)

40:03.435 --> 40:04.503
I'm not even worrying about

40:04.503 --> 40:05.504
that.

40:05.504 --> 40:06.538
(whooping)

40:06.538 --> 40:08.073
Hey!

40:08.073 --> 40:09.841
>> KRIS: Let me just say, life

40:09.841 --> 40:10.976
is very short, and you better

40:10.976 --> 40:12.444
figure it out really fast.

40:12.444 --> 40:13.545
>> CAITLYN: Oh, well, you know,

40:13.545 --> 40:14.546
I agree with that.

40:14.546 --> 40:15.547
Here we go way back there.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.083
>> MAN: Oh.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.487
(crowd chatter)

40:24.456 --> 40:25.924
(whooping)

40:25.924 --> 40:28.894
(indistinct chatter)

40:31.663 --> 40:33.532
>> MAN: Bruce, go straight.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.533
Bruce, go straight.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.534
(Caitlyn laughs)

40:35.534 --> 40:36.535
>> CAITLYN: What did he say?

40:36.535 --> 40:37.536
>> JENNY: He said, "Bruce, go

40:37.536 --> 40:38.537
straight."

40:38.537 --> 40:39.538
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.539
>> JENNY: I think that ship

40:40.539 --> 40:41.540
sailed.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.409
>> CAITLYN: I know.

40:44.409 --> 40:45.410
>> CANDIS: That was so much fun.

40:45.410 --> 40:46.411
>> KRIS: You look really

40:46.411 --> 40:47.546
beautiful.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.814
>> CAITLYN: It is absolutely

40:48.814 --> 40:49.815
amazing what a blow-dry will do.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.816
>> JENNY: A blow what?

40:50.816 --> 40:51.817
>> CAITLYN: A blow dry, yeah.

40:51.817 --> 40:52.818
>> JENNY: Dry. Blow dry.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.819
>> CAITLYN: A blow out.

40:53.819 --> 40:54.820
>> KIP: Uh-oh.

40:54.820 --> 40:55.654
>> CAITLYN: A blow out will do.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.655
>> COURTNEY: Blow job.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.656
>> CAITLYN: No.

40:57.656 --> 40:58.490
>> CANDIS: This is a very Doctor

40:58.490 --> 40:59.491
Zhivago jacket.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.325
>> JENNY: That's the coolest

41:00.325 --> 41:01.326
jacket.

41:01.326 --> 41:02.160
>> CHANDI: Tens, tens, tens.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.061
You've gotten tens across the

41:03.061 --> 41:03.829
board, Kris Jenner. Ten.

41:03.829 --> 41:04.663
>> KRIS: Tens, tens, tens.

41:04.663 --> 41:05.664
Good tens.

41:05.664 --> 41:06.532
You guys have all gotten a

41:06.532 --> 41:07.533
major ten from me.

41:07.533 --> 41:08.299
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.300
>> KRIS: You're all so

41:09.300 --> 41:10.301
delicious.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.302
>> CANDIS: Oh, thank you.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.137
>> CHANDI: Oh. We love it from

41:12.137 --> 41:13.138
you.

41:13.138 --> 41:13.972
>> KRIS: Pretty fab.

41:13.972 --> 41:14.640
>> JENNY: Delicious.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.574
>> KRIS: Really pretty fab,

41:15.574 --> 41:16.808
honest to God.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.643
I can't wait to see you guys

41:17.643 --> 41:18.644
again.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.645
>> CHANDI: Yes.

41:19.645 --> 41:20.546
>> KRIS: I mean that.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.446
Not you, Jenner.

41:21.446 --> 41:22.548
Just your friends.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.549
(laughter)

41:23.549 --> 41:24.983
>> JENNY: We're going right now.

41:24.983 --> 41:25.984
>> CAITLYN: Mmm.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.555
(cheering)

41:36.427 --> 41:37.462
>> CAITLYN: Little red light's

41:37.462 --> 41:38.964
on.

41:38.964 --> 41:41.600
(sighs)

41:41.600 --> 41:46.471
That... was a crazy night.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.839
Honestly, I feel good about it.

41:47.839 --> 41:48.907
I'm glad Kris had such a good

41:48.907 --> 41:50.108
time with all the girls.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.944
Um, there certainly was a little

41:52.944 --> 41:54.145
tension.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.446
But I really feel like there's

41:55.446 --> 41:56.782
one more thing I really need to

41:56.782 --> 41:59.117
do, and that is... before she

41:59.117 --> 42:00.819
leaves, have a one-on-one

42:00.819 --> 42:03.321
conversation with her, uh,

42:03.321 --> 42:05.456
because I feel like I have a lot

42:05.456 --> 42:07.058
to say to her.

42:07.058 --> 42:10.028
(insects trilling)

42:23.474 --> 42:24.676
>> CAITLYN: There's really a lot

42:24.676 --> 42:25.677
I want to get off my chest with

42:25.677 --> 42:26.678
Kris.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.614
The girls have taught me a lot

42:28.614 --> 42:30.448
on this trip about being more

42:30.448 --> 42:32.483
kinder, gentler, softer

42:32.483 --> 42:34.485
approach.

42:34.485 --> 42:37.522
I just hope I don't... kind of

42:37.522 --> 42:40.892
resort to the old habits, uh, of

42:40.892 --> 42:42.861
being defensive and loud.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.797
I've got a lot to say, and I'm

42:45.797 --> 42:48.066
afraid if I don't have it now,

42:48.066 --> 42:51.102
um, I'll probably never have the

42:51.102 --> 42:54.472
conversation.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.708
>> KRIS: Coming.

43:03.649 --> 43:04.650
>> KRIS: You changed your birth

43:04.650 --> 43:06.685
certificate?

43:06.685 --> 43:07.786
Does this mean that you didn't

43:07.786 --> 43:09.454
exist?

43:09.454 --> 43:10.789
>> JENNY: I've never regretted

43:10.789 --> 43:12.490
having surgery for one day, not

43:12.490 --> 43:14.660
one hour, never.

43:14.660 --> 43:15.961
>> CAITLYN: Right now, I'm-I'm

43:15.961 --> 43:16.962
not interested in doing

43:16.962 --> 43:17.963
something like that.

43:17.963 --> 43:19.130
>> JENNY: I don't believe it.

43:19.130 --> 43:21.299
I know she's thinking about it.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.300
>> WOMAN: In an independent

43:22.300 --> 43:23.301
adoption, you're gonna have to

43:23.301 --> 43:24.302
disclose that you're

43:24.302 --> 43:25.303
transgender.

43:25.303 --> 43:26.204
You've got to be matched with a

43:26.204 --> 43:27.205
birth mother that says I want my

43:27.205 --> 43:28.206
child raised by you.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.574
>> CANDIS: Wow.
