00:02.377 --> 00:04.333
NIKITA: Six years ago,
I was taken from prison...

00:04.505 --> 00:07.963
...and forced to become an assassin
for a secret unit of the government:

00:08.133 --> 00:11.796
A black-ops program called Division
that has now gone rogue.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.337
They destroyed my identity
and they destroyed the man / loved.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.677
I escaped
and now the man that trained me...

00:17.851 --> 00:20.183
...someone I trusted, is hunting me.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.304
Division’s power
and influence continues to grow.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.643
No one is outside their reach...

00:25.817 --> 00:27.808
...and they will annihilate any person...

00:27.986 --> 00:30.523
...any government
that stands in their way.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.235
But along with my partner, Alex,
who is undercover inside Division...

00:34.409 --> 00:36.149
...I will stop them.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.035
I will protect the innocents
they target...

00:39.206 --> 00:40.867
...and I will make them pay.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.714
ALEX:
This is how it’s gonna go down.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.481
Two security guards
by the main entrance.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.779
Single-zone walkthrough
metal detector...

01:14.950 --> 01:17.862
...hardwired to dedicated
police alarm...

01:18.036 --> 01:20.903
...which takes us
to two closed-circuit security cams.

01:25.711 --> 01:29.499
Once we 're past the lobby,
we move into the main hall.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.039
That's where the guests will be.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.092
The attack will be timed
so we reach the takedown point...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.427
...just as the target hits the stage.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.932
-Time?
-Eight minutes, 37.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.733
We add two minutes for evac,
we still have a 30-second cushion.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.530
ALEX:
Eleven minutes.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.530
That's how long it'll take
to kill Prince Erik of Georgia.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.790
You'll be posing as members
of the Georgian armed forces?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.667
You know they're loyal
to the existing administration.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.381
So Georgia's president
hired Division?

02:18.764 --> 02:22.928
To dress up as his own guys? No.
It's definitely a false flag mission.

02:23.101 --> 02:27.219
Someone wants the president
to take the fall for killing the prince.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.513
Good way to start a coup.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.229
And I warned her that
I don’t own a castle...

02:33.403 --> 02:34.939
...but she still said yes.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.855
I did buy him some shining armor
for a wedding present.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.991
-Yes. Very difﬁcult to get dry-cleaned.
-I can imagine.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.574
But Princess Kristina,
you're also from royalty, correct?

02:44.748 --> 02:48.536
Yes. Erik and I both come from families
with claims to the throne...

02:48.710 --> 02:52.874
...and uniting our bloodline has given
our supporters a huge boost.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.882
But beyond that, I 've always taken
my heritage serious/y.

02:57.052 --> 03:00.010
That's why I'm so excited about
the crown jewel exhibit...

03:00.222 --> 03:01.962
...we've brought to America.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.766
It's a pretty high-profile op
for your first mission.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.938
-Michael must really believe in you.
-No, Michael's not in on it.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.435
He's not?

03:12.609 --> 03:16.022
You know how he feels about
Percy's mission-for—hire jobs.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.739
Besides, he's busy reconfiguring
Division's defenses.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.652
You exposed some pretty big holes
when you busted out of there.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.746
Has he asked about me?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.033
In an operational context, that is.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.705
Not lately.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.211
So, what was the deal with you
and Michael?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.754
Let's just focus on the mission.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.594
What kind of intel does Division have?

03:47.436 --> 03:48.972
Everything.

03:49.146 --> 03:54.186
Security detail, personnel lists,
itinerary for the royal coup/e.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.439
All official.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.147
NIKITA: We 're going to need
to get a copy of those.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.912
-Can I help you, agent?
-Where's Birkhoff?

04:13.128 --> 04:15.084
On leave.
Can I help you with something?

04:15.297 --> 04:19.415
Uh, l was just going to review
the tactical plans for Operation Castle.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.801
Electronic tablet
or sent to your smartphone?

04:23.847 --> 04:24.882
Phone is fine.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.549
Done. Anything else?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.643
No. Thank you.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.349
Alex. Prepping for your op?

04:37.319 --> 04:40.277
It's the key to success, right,
preparation?

04:40.447 --> 04:43.063
Steven's a good man,
a good team leader for your first.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.856
How about you?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.117
Are you done making this place
Nikita-proof?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.788
Almost.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.162
Still need to set some redundancies.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.996
She has a way of corrupting systems
from the inside.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.295
Like a cancer.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.588
Alex.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.762
There's no such thing
as an easy mission.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.096
Won't be easy.
Someone on the inside's a source.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.138
Someone with top-level clearance.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.894
General Anton Zahidov,
head of Intelligence Services.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.278
He'd have the most to gain
from an assassination.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.864
Zahidov's been openly critical
of the president.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.953
He'll have plenty of it
after the prince is assassinated.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.914
So we need to get to the prince.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.251
Zahidov's head of his security.
He'll be watching him like a hawk.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.499
What about Kristina?

05:46.221 --> 05:49.554
You wanna get past Jafar, you go
straight to Princess Jasmine, right?

05:49.724 --> 05:53.763
Good. I'll work on a cover
to get into the museum event.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.895
We'll be in and out before
Division even gets there.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.774
Sounds easy enough.

06:00.944 --> 06:05.813
So this is us on the outside.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.279
-Working together.
-A whole new world.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.751
-Excuse me, Miss....
-Kantaria. Leela Kantaria.

07:08.929 --> 07:13.093
Ms. Kantaria, I'm sorry to disturb you, but
it's urgent that I speak with the princess.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.643
That may be difficult.
Maybe later in the evening.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.723
The Bagrationi necklace made by the
Finnish jeweler Hiskias Pendin in 1860.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.355
-Yes. Right over there.
-lt's fake.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.776
I want to show you something.

07:27.989 --> 07:32.107
Look at the chasing of the metalwork.
It has none of Pendin's signature detail.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.947
-You are certain?
-Look at the clarity of the stones

07:35.121 --> 07:37.373
It's clearly all wrong.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.532
Believe me.
I've studied his work for many years.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.793
-But the princess herself--
-Curated the collection, I know.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.295
I need to speak with her...

07:45.465 --> 07:48.548
...save her the embarrassment
from finding out from the media.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.676
Come with me.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.423
-Who is this?
-She needs to speak to the princess.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.557
-On what business?
-Cultural.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.362
Don't mind him. Someone forgot
to take him for a walk today.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.493
One moment.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.032
Excuse me, princess. I have someone
who needs to speak with you.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.499
I thought
I knew all the Pendin experts.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.416
Well, my expertise lies
in a very specific area.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.045
Someone is going
to kill your husband tonight.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.633
They know your every move.
They will strike within the hour.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.392
-This is my private itinerary.
-We need to warn the prince now.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.308
-Who are you?
-A friend.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.477
-Zahidov.
-No. He's compromised. Lose him.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.665
I gave him an excuse.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.452
All right, we need to get out of here.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.218
Gentlemen, could I trouble you
for the room for a minute?

09:19.517 --> 09:21.633
All the security tonight are our people.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.017
Where's your husband now?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.519
Getting ready for his speech.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.555
I have to find him, get you two out.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.065
Is there any way that you--?

09:31.654 --> 09:32.905
We have to get rid of her.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.243
When I was told of your services...

09:44.417 --> 09:48.080
...I was assured I'd receive the work
of a fully professional organization.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.665
And I can assure you
that is indeed the case, Your Highness.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.218
Don't condescend to me.

09:54.385 --> 09:58.003
-Who the hell is this bitch?
-She is a distraction.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.048
One that you've done
a very good job in dealing with.

10:01.559 --> 10:05.097
-What does this mean for the plan?
-Nothing. We 're on the count.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.352
Just keep her someplace safe
until my people get there.

10:09.526 --> 10:13.940
Although if you do kill her,
I'd be happy to cut my commission.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.196
Get me Steven.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.530
Dispose of her somewhere
out of view, quietly.

10:33.550 --> 10:38.886
Remember, everybody move quickly,
cover your AOR, stick to your routes.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.047
One more thing.
I just got word Nikita was on the scene.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.726
How did she get ahead of us?
Her mole was terminated.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.730
She breached the data network last week.
Must have intercepted the mission plan.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.232
Nikita's not an issue.
She's been put down.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.484
Everybody stay off all tactical channels
unless absolutely necessary.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.991
-Hit the cell phone jammer.
AGENT: Jammer active.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.411
GUARD [OVER RADIO]:
The prince is ready to go.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.870
Good. Send two guards with him.
I'll be right there.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.172
[GRUNTING]

11:34.402 --> 11:37.018
GUARD:
We are now standing by with the prince.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.028
Ladies and gentlemen,
we here at the Thorburg Cultural Center...

11:43.203 --> 11:47.788
...are honored tonight
to be in the presence of royalty.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.684
Their fairy-tale romance captured
the imagination of the world.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.845
Excuse me. You're not allowed--

12:12.023 --> 12:13.934
[GRUNTING]

12:14.108 --> 12:15.484
What is this?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.144
Your life is in danger.
You need to come with me.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.397
[SCREAMING]

12:24.577 --> 12:26.317
Who are they? Who are you?

12:26.496 --> 12:28.987
Intros later. Now run.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.503
Don't move.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.207
Right there. Move it right there.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.040
[IN GEORGIAN]

12:42.512 --> 12:44.719
Where's the target? Who has eyes on?

12:44.889 --> 12:48.928
Search the building. He can't be far.
Guard the entrance. No one gets in or out.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.262
Keep these people quiet.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.345
I'm going to the security office
to check the cameras.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.523
Everyone stay calm
and no one gets hurt.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.904
Can we stop? What is going on?

13:07.078 --> 13:09.911
-People are trying to kill you.
ERIK: I gathered that.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.540
-Why?
-Why? Power.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.706
Who? Well, Zahidov's in on it.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.875
So is Kristina.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.757
Kristina?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.431
I never thought she would go this far.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.938
What do you mean, go this far? Go.

13:40.737 --> 13:45.652
The wedding, our marriage, it was
something for our people to rally around.

13:46.409 --> 13:50.072
Our families thought we'd help restore
constitutional monarchy to Georgia.

13:50.246 --> 13:55.240
-The way it had been before the Russians.
-Sounds good. What happened?

13:56.044 --> 13:58.581
I told Kristina
that I was done after this trip.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.337
I'm giving up the throne.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.334
Why?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.461
You don't love her.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.017
People in love
don't try to kill each other.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.099
Are you serious?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.318
I'm in love with someone else.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.694
-Leela.
-Leela, the assistant?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.779
It's not what you think.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.114
Kristina knows. I told her.
She doesn't care.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.654
Apparently she does.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.948
You step down,
she loses her path to power.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.037
On the other hand, you die a martyr...

14:39.212 --> 14:41.669
...she rides that wave of sympathy
to the throne.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.883
-Do you trust Leela?
-With my life.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.712
Good. That's what I'm gonna do.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.051
-What's this?
-Leela has a headset on.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.310
It wasn't hard to find the frequency.
I need you to get a message to her.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.851
ERIK [OVER RADIO]:
Lee/a, can you hear me?

15:06.656 --> 15:07.816
-Erik?
-Shh, Shh.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.574
Don't talk. They'll hear you, okay?
Thank God you're okay.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.156
Look, I’ll come to save you, all right?

15:14.539 --> 15:18.623
You need to know something.
Kristina is behind this.

15:27.844 --> 15:31.007
Leela. Do you see the terrorist,
the brunette?

15:32.014 --> 15:35.142
Give her your headset.
Don’t worry. She won’t hurt you.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.726
-Whoa, whoa, stop.
-It's--

15:38.896 --> 15:40.181
It's for you.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.280
-Alex, it’s me.
-Where are you?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.031
I'm safe. I have the prince.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.409
-I'm guessing agents are looking for us.
-Two.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.411
Here's what I need you to do.

15:57.582 --> 16:02.076
There's a trigger for a silent alarm in
the security office. I saw it earlier. Trip it.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.369
-Who is it?
-It's Nikita.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.879
Listen, I caught you once
and I can do it again.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.882
-Can you get to the security office?
-I think you know that.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.215
The prince will be safe with the police,
but I can't get to them.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.596
You need to bring the end zone to us.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.224
You and the other agents, you can just
surrender. Percy will save you.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.056
You're never getting out.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.390
-Nikita.
-Another thing.

16:22.565 --> 16:27.559
The woman who gave you the headset,
she's with us. Protect her.

REPORTER [ON TV]:
How’s this for a shocker?

37:32.375 --> 37:37.165
Princess Kristina was taken into custody
this morning by Georgian ofﬁcials...

37:37.338 --> 37:41.672
...after she was implicated in a plot
to assassinate her husband, Prince Erik.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.085
The Georgian government says
an anonymous source...

37:45.263 --> 37:48.755
...has sent them security documents
used in the planning of the attack...

37:48.933 --> 37:52.642
...and that these documents originated
from the princess' ﬁles.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.554
These are difﬁcult circumstances.
