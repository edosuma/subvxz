01:45.300 --> 01:47.260
Get up, get up!

01:51.806 --> 01:53.892
Mixed up in that beating on 12th Street?

01:53.975 --> 01:55.268
No, plain drunkenness.

01:55.477 --> 01:57.020
It says he was picked up there.

01:57.103 --> 01:59.564
They had him on the carpet
down at headquarters.

01:59.772 --> 02:01.774
He's clear. Plain drunkenness.

02:01.983 --> 02:02.984
All right.

02:03.484 --> 02:04.444
Fill it up.

02:04.527 --> 02:05.778
Can I keep it?

02:06.487 --> 02:09.532
Okay. You want to lean him
against something?

02:09.991 --> 02:12.326
- Stand him over there.
- Come on.

02:30.427 --> 02:31.428
Judy?

02:32.054 --> 02:33.555
We're ready for you now.

02:51.364 --> 02:52.866
He must hate me.

02:53.074 --> 02:54.075
What?

02:56.244 --> 02:57.996
He hates me.

02:59.289 --> 03:00.874
What makes you think so?

03:02.125 --> 03:04.377
I don't think. I know.

03:06.212 --> 03:07.714
He looks at me like...

03:08.298 --> 03:10.883
I was the ugliest thing in the world.

03:11.968 --> 03:13.720
He doesn't like my friends.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.222
He doesn't like one thing about me.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.808
And he called me...

03:21.227 --> 03:23.646
He called me a dirty tramp!

03:24.730 --> 03:26.732
My own father!

03:28.526 --> 03:30.361
Do you think he really means that?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.029
Yes!

03:32.279 --> 03:33.572
No!

03:34.198 --> 03:35.991
I don't know.

03:39.661 --> 03:43.123
I mean, maybe he doesn't mean it...

03:43.332 --> 03:45.584
but he acts like he does.

03:46.919 --> 03:48.587
We were all together.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.757
And we were going to celebrate Easter.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.427
And we were going to catch a double bill.

03:57.262 --> 03:58.597
Big deal!

03:59.764 --> 04:01.933
So I put on my new dress...

04:03.268 --> 04:04.936
and I came out...

04:05.937 --> 04:07.939
and he grabbed my face...

04:08.815 --> 04:11.985
and he started rubbing off all the lipstick.

04:15.446 --> 04:17.781
I thought he'd rub off my lips.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.119
And I ran out of that house.

04:21.285 --> 04:23.955
Is that why you were
wandering around at 1:00 a. m.?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.085
Not looking for company?

04:30.836 --> 04:33.631
I don't even know why I do it.

04:34.131 --> 04:36.300
Maybe you get back at your dad that way.

04:36.383 --> 04:39.303
If you're not as close to him
as you'd like to be...

04:39.720 --> 04:42.931
maybe this is one way
of making him pay attention.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.433
Did you think of that?

04:45.893 --> 04:48.687
I'll never get close to anybody.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.732
Would you go home if we can arrange it?

04:57.529 --> 04:59.364
What's your number, Judy?

04:59.740 --> 05:02.242
We'll ask your dad
to come and pick you up.

05:02.492 --> 05:04.953
Unless you really don't want to go home.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.164
Would you rather stay here?

05:16.881 --> 05:19.342
Lexington 0-5-5-4-9.

05:35.191 --> 05:37.401
That's enough static out of you!

05:45.743 --> 05:47.953
Cut it out now. I'm warning you!

05:51.832 --> 05:54.877
You're shivering, John. Are you cold?

06:00.340 --> 06:01.758
Want my jacket?

06:09.391 --> 06:10.809
Want my jacket?

06:11.142 --> 06:12.561
It's warm.

06:28.076 --> 06:29.786
Your mother will pick you up.

06:30.078 --> 06:30.912
What?

06:31.245 --> 06:33.498
Your mother will be down to pick you up.

06:33.748 --> 06:35.041
My mother!

06:35.333 --> 06:37.001
She's being called for.

06:38.252 --> 06:40.588
You said you'd call my father!

06:41.422 --> 06:43.549
Goodbye, Judy. And take it easy.

06:44.091 --> 06:45.384
Oh, sure!

06:58.522 --> 06:59.481
John Crawford?

06:59.565 --> 07:00.566
Yes, sir?

07:00.941 --> 07:02.442
Come with me, John.

07:12.244 --> 07:13.328
Jim!

07:21.586 --> 07:23.004
Happy Easter.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.298
Happy Easter.

07:25.715 --> 07:27.425
Where were you tonight?

07:27.634 --> 07:30.094
They called us,
and I got the fright of my life!

07:30.178 --> 07:32.222
Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

07:42.148 --> 07:44.066
Well, then, there now.

07:45.192 --> 07:47.320
Were you having a ball, Dad?

07:49.655 --> 07:52.158
Well, everybody's been having a ball.

07:56.328 --> 07:58.539
You're the king of the ball, Dad.

08:06.547 --> 08:08.382
You think I'm funny?

08:23.146 --> 08:25.273
Why didn't you take my jacket?

08:25.982 --> 08:27.233
Jim Stark?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.285
John.

08:40.455 --> 08:41.456
John!

08:44.709 --> 08:47.503
Do you have any idea
why you shot those puppies?

08:49.046 --> 08:51.883
Is that what they call you,
or do you have a nickname?

08:52.883 --> 08:53.718
Plato.

08:53.926 --> 08:55.886
He was a Greek philosopher.

08:56.971 --> 09:00.808
You talk nice to the man now, hear?
He's going to help you.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.019
Nobody can help me.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.730
Can you tell me why
you killed those puppies?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.525
No, sir.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.695
Where'd you get the gun?

09:15.239 --> 09:16.490
My mother's drawer.

09:17.282 --> 09:19.368
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.078
She's away.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.538
She's always going away somewhere.

09:23.747 --> 09:27.083
She's got a sister in Chicago,
and she's there for the holiday.

09:27.542 --> 09:28.752
Where's your father?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.587
They're not together, sir.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.590
We haven't seen him now in a long time.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.259
Do you ever hear from him?

09:36.468 --> 09:39.971
I don't think it's right for a mother
to go and leave her child.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.140
It's his birthday today, sir.

09:44.309 --> 09:46.603
Did the boy ever talk to a psychiatrist?

09:48.438 --> 09:49.981
You mean a head shrinker?

09:50.857 --> 09:53.443
Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them, sir.

09:54.318 --> 09:56.195
Maybe she'd better start.

09:56.445 --> 09:58.573
Sit over there for just a minute, please.

10:04.703 --> 10:08.123
I don't see what's so bad
about taking a little drink.

10:08.290 --> 10:09.792
You don't?

10:10.042 --> 10:11.126
He's a minor...

10:11.293 --> 10:14.088
and it looks like he had more
than a "little drink. "

10:14.963 --> 10:16.382
Don't hum, dear.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.676
I cut loose pretty good in my day too.

10:19.885 --> 10:20.969
Really, Frank?

10:21.428 --> 10:22.429
When was that?

10:22.513 --> 10:24.556
Can't you wait till we get home?

10:24.765 --> 10:25.807
How about you?

10:26.058 --> 10:27.934
Got anything to say for yourself?

10:29.269 --> 10:30.604
Not interested?

10:31.146 --> 10:32.814
Can't you answer?

10:33.023 --> 10:34.441
What's the matter with you?

10:34.524 --> 10:36.193
He's just loaded, honey.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.528
I was talking to Jim!

10:38.820 --> 10:42.741
Well, I'd like to just explain.
You see, we just moved here...

10:42.949 --> 10:45.618
and the kid hasn't got any friends.

10:45.827 --> 10:47.328
Tell him why we moved here.

10:47.495 --> 10:48.788
Will you hold it?

10:48.997 --> 10:50.498
Tell the man why we moved.

10:50.665 --> 10:52.834
- Will you hold it!
- You can't protect me.

10:53.167 --> 10:57.588
Do you mind if I try? Do you
have to slam the door in my face?

10:58.214 --> 11:01.259
I try to get to him. What happens?

11:01.467 --> 11:04.595
I buy you everything you want.
A bicycle? You get it!

11:04.804 --> 11:06.931
- A car...
- You buy me many things.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.266
Not just buying!

11:09.475 --> 11:11.560
We give you love and affection, don't we?

11:11.644 --> 11:12.978
Then what is it?

11:13.187 --> 11:15.147
Was it because we went to that party?

11:15.356 --> 11:19.360
You know what kind of drunken brawls
those kind of parties turn into.

11:19.777 --> 11:20.986
It's no place for kids!

11:21.070 --> 11:23.781
A minute ago,
you said you didn't care if he drinks.

11:23.989 --> 11:25.866
He said a "little" drink.

11:26.283 --> 11:29.203
You're tearing me apart!

11:30.704 --> 11:34.708
You say one thing, he says another,
and everybody changes back again!

11:35.500 --> 11:36.960
That's a fine way to behave!

11:37.044 --> 11:39.546
Well, you know who he takes after.

11:45.927 --> 11:47.345
Inside, Jim.

11:49.055 --> 11:49.931
Come on.

11:50.390 --> 11:51.391
Inside.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.978
- Excuse us a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

12:01.109 --> 12:04.070
Somebody ought to put poison
in her Epsom salts.

12:04.654 --> 12:05.738
Grandma?

12:06.739 --> 12:08.074
Get lost.

12:08.574 --> 12:11.077
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.

12:13.829 --> 12:15.998
Why don't you wash up and go home?

12:16.582 --> 12:18.084
This is cute.

12:19.001 --> 12:21.086
Big, tough character!

12:21.629 --> 12:23.589
You don't kid me, pal.

12:24.173 --> 12:26.383
How come you're not wearing your boots?

12:28.260 --> 12:29.720
Well, that's cute.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.432
That's cute.

12:47.946 --> 12:49.948
It's too bad you didn't connect.

12:51.574 --> 12:53.785
You could have gone to juvenile hall.

12:55.286 --> 12:56.955
That's what you want, isn't it?

12:59.499 --> 13:00.834
Sure, it is.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.630
You want to bug us
till we have to lock you up.

13:06.297 --> 13:07.173
Why?

13:07.382 --> 13:09.008
- Leave me alone.
- No.

13:11.135 --> 13:12.261
I don't know why.

13:12.345 --> 13:14.055
Go on, don't give me that!

13:14.472 --> 13:18.476
Please, lock me up. I'll hit somebody.
I'll do something, and I don't...

13:21.062 --> 13:22.188
Try the desk.

13:26.317 --> 13:27.318
Go ahead.

14:04.979 --> 14:07.857
Is that why you moved?
You were in trouble?

14:09.359 --> 14:10.777
No, they think...

14:12.737 --> 14:16.032
that they can protect me
by moving around all the time.

14:16.657 --> 14:20.328
You had a good start in the wrong
direction. Why'd you do it?

14:21.996 --> 14:23.205
What do you mean?

14:24.206 --> 14:25.750
Mess a kid up?

14:31.046 --> 14:32.381
He called me chicken.

14:33.924 --> 14:35.634
Your folks didn't understand?

14:37.845 --> 14:39.263
They never do.

14:44.309 --> 14:46.728
They think that I can make friends...

14:47.896 --> 14:48.897
if we move.

14:53.402 --> 14:56.780
Just move. Everything
will be roses and sunshine.

14:57.239 --> 14:59.574
But you don't think
that's the right solution?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.872
She eats him alive and he takes it.

15:06.247 --> 15:08.249
Things pretty rough for you at home?

15:09.918 --> 15:11.085
That's a zoo!

15:11.586 --> 15:12.587
What?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.590
That's a zoo!

15:18.092 --> 15:20.803
I mean, he always wants to be my pal,
you know?

15:22.638 --> 15:25.475
But how can I give him anything if he's...

15:28.227 --> 15:32.064
I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.

15:34.025 --> 15:35.818
I don't want to hurt him.

15:36.444 --> 15:39.905
But then I don't know what to do anymore.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.408
Except maybe die.

15:42.616 --> 15:46.453
If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...

15:46.704 --> 15:49.957
then maybe she'd be happy
and she'd stop picking on him.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.168
Because they make mush out of him!

15:53.961 --> 15:56.838
You know, just mush!

16:00.133 --> 16:03.637
I'll tell you one thing,
I don't ever want to be like him.

16:04.554 --> 16:05.388
Chicken?

16:06.431 --> 16:08.850
I'll bet you see right through me,
don't you?

16:13.355 --> 16:16.316
How can a guy grow up
in a circus like that?

16:16.649 --> 16:18.151
Beats me, Jim.

16:19.485 --> 16:20.737
But they do.

16:21.112 --> 16:22.405
Want some water?

16:28.828 --> 16:31.164
If I had one day...

16:36.335 --> 16:38.921
when I didn't have to be all confused...

16:40.756 --> 16:44.385
and I didn't have to feel
that I was ashamed of everything...

16:45.344 --> 16:47.596
If I felt that I belonged someplace...

16:47.805 --> 16:49.640
You know? Then...

16:55.604 --> 16:57.523
Will you do something for me?

17:00.234 --> 17:04.655
If the pot starts boiling again,
will you see me before you get in a jam?

17:05.696 --> 17:08.825
If you want to talk,
come in and shoot the breeze.

17:09.617 --> 17:12.204
It's easier sometimes
than talking to your folks.

17:17.041 --> 17:18.960
Anytime, night or day.

17:26.384 --> 17:30.305
You calmed down enough
to go back in there now?

17:32.849 --> 17:34.559
Are you serious?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.734
Mother, I'm sorry.

17:43.901 --> 17:45.778
It's all right, darling.

17:46.153 --> 17:47.405
Mister Officer...

17:47.696 --> 17:49.740
this was all very unfortunate.

17:49.907 --> 17:53.744
He made a mistake, and he's sorry,
so we won't have any more trouble.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.455
He was always a lovely boy.

17:56.664 --> 18:00.250
Grandmother, you tell one more lie
and you'll turn to stone.

18:03.837 --> 18:04.838
Look, Jim...

18:05.047 --> 18:06.256
don't forget.

18:07.049 --> 18:09.217
Have some cigars?

18:10.010 --> 18:11.511
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.138
Give them to your friends.

18:13.221 --> 18:14.598
No, thanks, Mr. Stark.

18:14.681 --> 18:16.766
Frank, he doesn't want any.

18:23.773 --> 18:26.609
Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.

18:31.072 --> 18:32.866
Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.

18:33.783 --> 18:34.784
Beau!

18:40.248 --> 18:41.749
Come here, Beau!

18:43.501 --> 18:44.961
Beau, come on!

18:45.836 --> 18:48.089
I don't think I want anything.

18:49.548 --> 18:50.549
I'm nervous.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.552
My first day of school,
Mother made me eat so much...

18:53.761 --> 18:55.554
I couldn't swallow until recess.

18:56.013 --> 18:57.598
Did you fix any sandwiches?

18:58.140 --> 19:00.142
There's meatloaf and peanut butter...

19:03.646 --> 19:05.981
What did I tell you? Peanut butter.

19:08.484 --> 19:10.360
There's a thermos of orange juice...

19:10.569 --> 19:12.738
and some applesauce cake to go with it.

19:12.946 --> 19:14.281
And I baked it.

19:20.454 --> 19:21.496
Goodbye, Mom.

19:21.705 --> 19:25.542
Young fellow, you knock them dead
like your old man used to.

19:26.918 --> 19:28.503
You know what I think?

19:28.712 --> 19:31.256
I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.676
Listen, watch out
about choosing your pals.

19:34.884 --> 19:36.344
Don't let them choose you.

19:51.859 --> 19:52.860
Wait a minute.

20:03.454 --> 20:04.788
I've seen you before.

20:05.039 --> 20:07.875
- Stop the world!
- You don't have to be unfriendly.

20:08.042 --> 20:09.710
Well, now that's true.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.296
But life is crushing in on me.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.757
Life can be beautiful.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.096
- I know where it was.
- Where what was?

20:22.681 --> 20:24.307
Where I first saw you.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.019
Everything going okay now?

20:29.980 --> 20:31.481
You live here, don't you?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.650
Who lives?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.194
Hey, where's Dawson High?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.279
At University and Tenth.

20:39.030 --> 20:39.864
Thanks.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.408
You want to carry my books?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.038
I got my car. You want to go with me?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.040
I go with the kids.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.086
I'll bet.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.427
All right.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.390
You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.937
I love you too.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.405
What's that?

21:24.533 --> 21:27.369
- That's a new disease.
- Friend of yours?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.788
- Glad they let you out.
- Nobody chickened.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.208
- You're lucky he lived.
- They always live.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.252
Man, I'm living!

21:38.964 --> 21:41.007
Hey, which way to University and Tenth?

21:41.216 --> 21:43.968
Which way is it to University and Tenth?

21:44.344 --> 21:46.638
- It's that way!
- No, it's that way!

22:47.572 --> 22:48.698
Hey, watch it!

22:49.449 --> 22:51.409
Where do you think you're going?

22:52.869 --> 22:56.289
You stepped on the school insignia.
Nobody does that, ever!

22:56.498 --> 22:58.416
I'm sorry. It's my first day here...

22:58.499 --> 23:00.543
and nobody told me about it.

23:00.752 --> 23:02.545
- I'm very sorry.
- It's okay.

23:02.754 --> 23:04.005
Know where to report?

23:04.547 --> 23:05.715
Mr. Bassett.

23:07.216 --> 23:09.927
Room 208. He'll show you where to go.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.512
I'm sorry about that.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.556
Just watch it next time.

24:32.967 --> 24:35.135
and immensity of our universe.

24:35.302 --> 24:37.888
For many days
before the end of our Earth...

24:38.347 --> 24:41.517
people will look
into the night sky and notice a star...

24:41.725 --> 24:44.686
increasingly bright and increasingly near.

24:44.895 --> 24:46.730
As this star approaches us...

24:48.649 --> 24:49.858
Jim Stark.

24:50.984 --> 24:52.778
I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

24:52.861 --> 24:55.947
As this star approaches us,
the weather will change.

24:56.364 --> 25:00.535
The great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide.

25:00.744 --> 25:03.163
And the seas will turn warmer.

25:03.705 --> 25:06.749
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed.

25:06.958 --> 25:09.419
For the stars will still be there...

25:09.627 --> 25:12.088
moving through their ancient rhythms.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.425
The familiar constellations
that illuminate our night...

25:15.508 --> 25:17.677
will seem as they have always seemed:

25:17.760 --> 25:20.763
Eternal, unchanged and little moved...

25:20.972 --> 25:24.350
by the shortness of time
between our planet's birth and demise.

25:26.018 --> 25:27.770
Orion, the hunter.

25:27.979 --> 25:29.605
One of Ptolemy's constellations...

25:29.689 --> 25:32.024
and the most brilliant in the heavens.

25:32.191 --> 25:33.025
Boy!

25:35.361 --> 25:36.529
What?

25:38.155 --> 25:39.740
I was just thinking that...

25:39.949 --> 25:42.826
once you've been up there
you know you been some place.

25:46.663 --> 25:48.165
Gesundheit!

25:49.208 --> 25:51.168
They're almost equal in brilliancy.

25:52.878 --> 25:54.629
Cancer, the crab...

25:54.838 --> 25:59.301
containing a large, loose cluster of stars,
called Praesepe or the Beehive.

26:00.719 --> 26:02.179
I'm a crab!

26:04.514 --> 26:07.183
The sun can be vertically overhead.

26:11.312 --> 26:13.231
Taurus, the bull.

26:21.698 --> 26:23.282
That's real funny.

26:25.493 --> 26:26.828
A comedian, Buzz.

26:27.370 --> 26:29.747
He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.

26:30.373 --> 26:32.083
I bet he fights cows.

26:39.757 --> 26:41.717
You shouldn't monkey with him.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.762
- He's a wheel.
- Who?

26:44.970 --> 26:46.096
Buzz.

26:46.555 --> 26:48.098
So is she.

26:49.099 --> 26:51.602
It's hard to make friends with these guys.

26:53.896 --> 26:55.689
I don't want to make friends.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.192
And while the flash of our beginning...

26:59.276 --> 27:02.487
has not yet traveled
the light years into distance...

27:02.696 --> 27:06.616
has not yet been seen by planets
deep within the other galaxies...

27:06.783 --> 27:10.662
we will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we came...

27:10.870 --> 27:15.375
destroyed as we began,
in a burst of gas and fire.

27:34.602 --> 27:37.980
The heavens are still and cold once more.

27:38.856 --> 27:42.943
In all the immensity of our universe
and the galaxies beyond...

27:43.152 --> 27:45.237
the Earth will not be missed.

27:45.488 --> 27:47.615
Through the infinite reaches of space...

27:47.698 --> 27:51.327
the problems of man seem
trivial and naive indeed.

27:51.994 --> 27:54.955
And man, existing alone...

27:55.164 --> 27:58.083
seems himself an episode
of little consequence.

27:58.667 --> 27:59.960
That's all.

28:00.335 --> 28:02.546
Thank you for your attention.

28:02.838 --> 28:04.506
Thank you very much.

28:08.301 --> 28:11.471
May I have your attention?
May I please have your attention?

28:11.680 --> 28:15.684
Classes will meet at the busses outside.
May I have your attention?

28:15.892 --> 28:18.019
May I have your attention?

28:18.353 --> 28:19.854
Oh, what the heck!

28:36.037 --> 28:37.789
It's all over. The world ended.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.250
What does he know about man alone?

28:58.851 --> 29:00.853
Certainly is a lot of switches.

29:01.103 --> 29:02.855
Yeah, quite intricate.

29:03.522 --> 29:06.650
- Hey, what's for kicks?
- What do you say, Buzz?

29:06.859 --> 29:08.485
Well, what do you want to do?

29:09.069 --> 29:11.530
- How about Moo?
- You mean the guy in there?

29:11.738 --> 29:13.573
- The comedian.
- What do you say?

29:14.199 --> 29:16.368
All right! What do you want to do?

29:16.576 --> 29:18.286
Let's bring him down.

29:18.912 --> 29:20.330
He'd make a good pigeon.

29:20.747 --> 29:24.584
- What's the funny guy doing?
- The guy in back of us, Buzz.

29:24.793 --> 29:27.170
He ought to have his wardrobe
cleaned and burned.

29:27.253 --> 29:29.464
- All right, Moo.
- All right.

29:30.757 --> 29:32.926
- What will we do with him?
- Don't worry.

29:33.134 --> 29:35.762
I'll figure out what we'll do with him.

29:36.512 --> 29:38.598
Relax. He'll figure it out.

30:19.471 --> 30:20.931
What are you looking at?

30:21.807 --> 30:22.933
Nothing.

30:35.070 --> 30:38.531
I told you not to fool with those guys.
Now they're laying for you.

30:38.615 --> 30:41.367
If you don't want trouble,
I know where we can go.

30:41.576 --> 30:42.785
It's a big mansion.

30:49.459 --> 30:50.751
There it is.

30:51.377 --> 30:53.629
We could sneak around
and they wouldn't know.

30:53.713 --> 30:56.507
- Who lives there?
- Nobody lives there.

30:56.966 --> 30:58.467
Come on, let's go!

31:00.344 --> 31:01.262
There he is.

31:12.815 --> 31:13.774
That's his car.

32:01.112 --> 32:02.405
Relax, man.

33:05.633 --> 33:07.218
- You know something?
- No, what?

33:07.301 --> 33:09.303
You read too many comic books.

33:10.179 --> 33:13.974
Well, he's real abstract! He's different.

33:14.141 --> 33:15.518
That's right.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.022
I'm cute too.

33:23.609 --> 33:25.027
Is that meaning me?

33:25.486 --> 33:26.987
- Is that meaning me?
- What?

33:27.196 --> 33:28.447
Chicken!

33:29.114 --> 33:30.032
Yes.

33:30.782 --> 33:32.326
You shouldn't call me that.

33:42.085 --> 33:43.503
How about you?

33:46.548 --> 33:48.592
Are you always at ringside?

33:49.676 --> 33:52.178
What are you hanging around
such rank company for?

33:56.015 --> 33:56.975
What?

34:00.186 --> 34:01.688
I don't want any trouble.

34:01.854 --> 34:03.606
The blade game, Buzz?

34:09.277 --> 34:11.614
I thought only punks fought with knives.

34:12.031 --> 34:13.532
Who's fighting?

34:13.741 --> 34:16.284
No fighting. It's examination time, man.

34:16.494 --> 34:18.661
It's a crazy game.

34:20.206 --> 34:21.456
Get him a knife.

34:24.210 --> 34:25.460
Give it to him.

34:27.670 --> 34:29.255
Come on, give him a knife.

34:29.422 --> 34:31.507
- Pick it up!
- I don't want any trouble.

34:32.217 --> 34:33.135
Pick it up!

34:39.516 --> 34:40.559
Pick it up!

34:48.108 --> 34:49.860
Now, you understand the action?

34:50.235 --> 34:52.112
There's no sticking.

34:53.237 --> 34:54.531
Crunch?

34:58.618 --> 34:59.536
Just...

35:00.120 --> 35:02.539
a little jabbing. That's all.

35:03.915 --> 35:05.833
What's the matter?

35:07.543 --> 35:09.087
What's the matter?

35:09.295 --> 35:12.965
What're you waiting on, toreador?
I thought you wanted a little action.

35:15.968 --> 35:18.888
- Are you crumb chicken or...
- Don't call me that!

35:22.224 --> 35:23.225
Toro!

36:03.640 --> 36:06.142
Cut off a button and
you get to join the club.

36:06.351 --> 36:07.602
Oh, that's close!

36:15.109 --> 36:16.944
Look out, Buzz! He's got a chain!

36:26.454 --> 36:27.622
Dr. Minton!

36:35.254 --> 36:38.007
All right, you asked for it, you've got it.

36:39.091 --> 36:40.843
- What is it?
- Trouble.

36:42.011 --> 36:44.221
Are you satisfied or
do you want some more?

36:50.561 --> 36:51.979
There's your audience.

36:52.187 --> 36:53.522
I don't think so.

36:54.147 --> 36:55.107
Let's split, Buzz.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.818
Split for what?
A couple of old poopheads?

37:02.989 --> 37:05.200
Now, you say the word and you're dead.

37:05.867 --> 37:06.993
You're cold.

37:07.202 --> 37:09.913
I'll meet you someplace,
but not with those things.

37:10.622 --> 37:12.248
That's trouble.

37:15.043 --> 37:17.962
How then? You know the Millertown bluff?

37:18.213 --> 37:20.798
The bluff?
Hey, Buzz, that's dangerous up there.

37:21.883 --> 37:26.262
Cookie, get some cars, and we'll have
some kicks tonight about 8:00.

37:26.471 --> 37:28.264
- All right.
- We'll have a chickie-run.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.557
Sounds good. Fine.

37:29.765 --> 37:31.601
You ever been in a chickie-run?

37:32.727 --> 37:34.228
That's all I ever do.

37:35.062 --> 37:37.440
Come on, all of you. Start moving!

37:37.648 --> 37:38.816
Come on, get going.

37:38.899 --> 37:41.068
Oh, you don't mean little old us?

37:41.235 --> 37:43.654
What's the matter with the nice man?

37:45.072 --> 37:47.032
We were just cutting out!

37:47.992 --> 37:49.034
Eight o'clock?

37:49.451 --> 37:50.911
Yeah.

37:52.454 --> 37:53.497
Okay.

38:04.174 --> 38:06.593
Plato, what is a chickie-run?

38:38.916 --> 38:39.959
Mom?

38:42.837 --> 38:45.589
Hi, Jimbo. You thought I was Mom?

38:48.592 --> 38:49.426
Yeah.

38:49.718 --> 38:53.264
Well, the girl's out.
I was getting Mom some supper.

38:53.555 --> 38:55.683
She doesn't feel too well.

38:57.810 --> 38:59.311
What'd you do, drop it?

38:59.812 --> 39:00.979
You dropped it?

39:08.445 --> 39:09.905
- That's funny.
- I know it.

39:09.988 --> 39:13.742
- I'll clean up before she sees it.
- Let her see it.

39:16.411 --> 39:17.495
Let her see it!

39:18.663 --> 39:20.498
What can happen? She's...

39:25.503 --> 39:26.504
Dad?

39:40.685 --> 39:42.520
Stand. Don't...

39:43.187 --> 39:45.106
I mean, you shouldn't...

39:56.325 --> 39:57.368
Beau?

40:02.581 --> 40:03.707
Daddy?

40:05.084 --> 40:06.835
Haven't you forgotten something?

40:10.255 --> 40:11.715
What's the matter with you?

40:11.965 --> 40:15.886
You're too old for that stuff.
I thought you'd stopped that long ago.

40:18.305 --> 40:19.848
I didn't want to stop.

40:20.724 --> 40:23.268
- Didn't want to stop what?
- Nothing, nothing.

40:23.977 --> 40:25.103
I was talking to Dad.

40:25.186 --> 40:27.897
I didn't kiss her, so it's a big thing.

40:28.732 --> 40:30.734
Bertha, you may serve the souffle.

40:30.942 --> 40:32.318
It's fish souffle.

40:33.236 --> 40:36.906
You don't have to stand, darling.
Sit down and have your tomato juice.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.744
I guess I just don't understand anything.

40:42.245 --> 40:45.081
I'm tired. I'd like to change the subject.

40:45.665 --> 40:46.874
Why?

40:47.083 --> 40:48.918
I'd just like to, that's all!

40:49.126 --> 40:52.672
Girls your age don't do things like that!
You need an explanation?

40:53.422 --> 40:54.799
Hi, rascal!

40:56.092 --> 40:57.802
Girls don't love their father?

40:58.344 --> 40:59.595
Since when?

41:00.095 --> 41:01.847
Since I got to be 16?

41:03.057 --> 41:04.934
Stop that! Sit down!

41:08.979 --> 41:11.065
May I please be excused?

41:15.903 --> 41:17.446
Hey, glamour puss!

41:17.738 --> 41:20.699
I'm sorry. We'll break the date.
We'll stay home.

41:21.325 --> 41:22.868
This isn't my home!

41:31.793 --> 41:33.295
I don't know what to do.

41:33.461 --> 41:35.922
All of a sudden she's a problem.

41:36.423 --> 41:39.676
She'll outgrow it, dear. It's just the age.

41:39.884 --> 41:41.469
The atomic age!

41:47.767 --> 41:50.561
It's just the age when nothing fits.

42:04.366 --> 42:05.493
Hey, Jimbo?

42:08.662 --> 42:09.914
- You awake?
- Dad?

42:10.956 --> 42:12.374
Can I ask you something?

42:12.583 --> 42:14.126
Sure.

42:17.212 --> 42:18.088
Shoot.

42:18.672 --> 42:21.842
Suppose you had to do something.

42:24.177 --> 42:25.679
You had to go someplace...

42:26.722 --> 42:28.849
and do this thing that was...

42:29.516 --> 42:31.643
you know, it was very dangerous.

42:32.811 --> 42:34.980
But it was a matter of honor.

42:37.357 --> 42:39.109
And you had to prove it.

42:39.818 --> 42:41.027
What would you do?

42:42.112 --> 42:45.365
Well, is there some kind of trick answer?

42:45.907 --> 42:47.992
No, what would you do?

42:48.743 --> 42:51.704
Well, I wouldn't make a hasty decision.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.373
Tell you what, Jimbo.

42:53.581 --> 42:56.542
Let's get a little light on the subject.

43:05.217 --> 43:06.260
Blood.

43:09.055 --> 43:10.556
Jim, what happened?

43:10.723 --> 43:13.309
What kind of trouble are you in?

43:16.395 --> 43:19.315
The kind I was telling you about.
Now can you answer me?

43:21.233 --> 43:23.402
Nobody can make a snap decision.

43:23.569 --> 43:26.029
It's one of those things that you...
You can't.

43:26.238 --> 43:27.865
That's all there is to it.

43:28.824 --> 43:31.243
It's something that you... You just don't.

43:35.580 --> 43:38.917
We've got to consider
all the pros and cons.

43:39.334 --> 43:40.752
I don't have time.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.212
We'll make time.

43:42.420 --> 43:44.422
I'll get paper and we'll make a list.

43:44.589 --> 43:46.466
And then if we're still stuck...

43:46.966 --> 43:49.177
we'll get some advice.

43:54.390 --> 43:56.684
What can you do
when you have to be a man?

43:57.060 --> 43:58.227
Well...

43:59.103 --> 44:01.022
No, you give me a direct answer!

44:01.314 --> 44:03.441
Are you going to keep me from going?

44:04.025 --> 44:06.068
Did I ever stop you from anything?

44:06.777 --> 44:08.279
You're at a wonderful age.

44:08.362 --> 44:11.407
In ten years, you'll look back
on this and wish...

44:11.616 --> 44:13.075
Ten years?

44:14.618 --> 44:17.204
I want an answer now. I need one.

44:18.122 --> 44:22.626
Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying
to show you how foolish you are.

44:22.835 --> 44:25.879
When you're older,
you'll look back at this...

44:26.088 --> 44:28.132
and you'll laugh at yourself...

44:28.298 --> 44:31.468
for thinking that this is so important.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.137
It's not as if you were alone.

44:34.346 --> 44:37.057
This has happened to every boy.

44:37.766 --> 44:41.853
It happened to me when I was your age,
maybe a year older.

44:46.358 --> 44:47.651
What's all the excitement?

44:47.734 --> 44:50.445
I've been working hard
getting this house in order...

44:50.528 --> 44:51.988
Jim had blood on him.

44:52.197 --> 44:55.116
- He just ran out.
- And you didn't stop him?

45:46.208 --> 45:47.834
Hey, Chicken Little!

45:48.043 --> 45:50.212
Where's toreador? He beg off?

45:50.378 --> 45:52.506
He's not scared of you.

45:56.301 --> 45:58.595
- There he is.
- Over there, man.

46:03.683 --> 46:06.269
- How did you get here?
- I hitched.

46:07.478 --> 46:10.356
I bet you'd go to a hanging, wouldn't you?

46:10.565 --> 46:13.151
I guess it's just my morbid personality.

46:15.069 --> 46:16.112
Should I leave?

46:16.195 --> 46:17.530
No, it's okay.

46:33.712 --> 46:36.048
Come on. Let's go see what we're driving.

46:46.475 --> 46:48.101
No, just him.

46:48.310 --> 46:50.187
It's okay. Stay here.

46:53.023 --> 46:54.983
What did you say your name was?

46:56.109 --> 46:57.486
Jim Stark.

46:57.694 --> 47:00.155
Yeah, I'm Buzz Gunderson.

47:03.116 --> 47:04.951
I got some goodies for you.

47:05.118 --> 47:06.786
You got a flashlight?

47:11.457 --> 47:13.209
Is he a friend of yours?

47:17.839 --> 47:19.757
Yeah, he's my best friend.

47:21.259 --> 47:22.635
What's he like?

47:25.805 --> 47:27.390
I don't know.

47:28.015 --> 47:29.642
You have to get to know him.

47:30.643 --> 47:32.061
He doesn't say much.

47:32.269 --> 47:34.480
But when he does, you know he means it.

47:34.772 --> 47:36.232
He's sincere.

47:37.316 --> 47:39.068
Well, that's the main thing.

47:39.318 --> 47:41.654
- You want to flip?
- Yeah, go ahead.

47:44.782 --> 47:45.949
Heads.

47:48.660 --> 47:52.581
Maybe next summer, he'll take me
hunting with him. And fishing.

47:53.415 --> 47:57.252
I want him to teach me because
I know he won't get mad if I goof.

47:58.337 --> 47:59.671
His name's Jim.

47:59.880 --> 48:03.091
It's really James, but he likes Jim more.

48:04.509 --> 48:07.887
And people he really likes,
he lets them call him Jamie.

48:08.597 --> 48:09.806
Jamie?

48:11.182 --> 48:12.600
Try the doors.

48:16.020 --> 48:17.856
Hey, try it with the jump.

48:45.049 --> 48:46.675
That's the edge.

48:48.177 --> 48:49.219
That's the end.

48:53.390 --> 48:54.892
Certainly is.

48:58.687 --> 49:00.188
You know something?

49:02.774 --> 49:04.317
I like you.

49:05.736 --> 49:07.112
You know that?

49:08.947 --> 49:10.407
Why do we do this?

49:10.615 --> 49:12.742
You got to do something...

49:13.076 --> 49:14.494
now, don't you?

49:50.529 --> 49:52.406
Take them up all the way to the end.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.033
Get all the girls!

49:54.908 --> 49:56.660
Bring it up to the left side.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.167
Crunch, line them up!

50:03.709 --> 50:06.628
Go to the end and
bring your cars up on the right.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.047
Put your car on the left-hand side.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.550
Turn your lights in toward the center.

50:11.758 --> 50:13.135
Let's line them up!

50:13.301 --> 50:14.803
Moose, come here.

50:14.970 --> 50:18.306
Straighten them out.
Tell them when to turn on their lights.

50:18.473 --> 50:19.933
Johnny!

50:20.141 --> 50:22.686
Follow that dark roadster over there.

50:34.072 --> 50:34.989
You're okay?

50:35.156 --> 50:36.491
Give me some dirt.

50:45.333 --> 50:46.751
Hey, toreador!

50:49.128 --> 50:50.338
She signals...

50:50.504 --> 50:52.423
we head for the edge.

50:52.965 --> 50:55.176
And the first man who jumps is a chicken.

50:55.676 --> 50:57.011
All right?

51:19.199 --> 51:20.492
Me too.

51:23.036 --> 51:25.497
May I have some dirt, please?

52:05.786 --> 52:07.746
Hit your lights!

53:42.464 --> 53:43.423
Where's Buzz?

53:43.506 --> 53:45.008
Down there.

53:51.222 --> 53:52.682
Let's get out of here!

54:00.106 --> 54:01.149
Down there.

54:01.357 --> 54:03.234
Down there is Buzz!

55:08.422 --> 55:09.924
This is fine.

55:21.268 --> 55:22.728
You'll be all right?

55:36.783 --> 55:38.410
You want to see a monkey?

56:12.819 --> 56:15.863
Want to come home with me?
There's nobody at my house.

56:16.072 --> 56:18.240
Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

56:18.449 --> 56:20.826
I don't have too many people I can talk to.

56:21.035 --> 56:22.453
Who has?

56:22.995 --> 56:24.955
If you want to come, we could talk...

56:25.164 --> 56:27.917
then we could have breakfast,
like my dad used to.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.835
If only you could've been my dad...

56:29.919 --> 56:31.337
You flipped or something?

56:31.545 --> 56:32.671
Look.

56:34.673 --> 56:37.092
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

56:37.426 --> 56:40.137
I've got to pick up my scooter anyway,
you know.

56:40.345 --> 56:41.597
I know.

56:46.935 --> 56:48.353
See you tomorrow.

57:16.506 --> 57:18.758
Hello, little cute sister.

57:20.051 --> 57:24.055
Hello, darling, baby-pie,
glamour puss, sweetie.

57:29.226 --> 57:30.895
You belong in bed.

59:15.663 --> 59:17.165
He's home!

59:17.457 --> 59:19.000
You're home!

59:25.798 --> 59:26.841
You're home.

59:27.008 --> 59:28.718
Are you all right?

59:28.926 --> 59:30.887
Where were you? We were so worried.

59:32.555 --> 59:35.016
I wouldn't take a sleeping pill
till you were home.

59:35.099 --> 59:38.019
Can I talk to you guys?
I have to talk to somebody.

59:43.524 --> 59:46.026
You better give me an answer this time.

59:46.193 --> 59:47.695
Go ahead.

59:47.987 --> 59:49.947
A direct answer.

59:51.031 --> 59:52.700
I'm in trouble.

59:52.950 --> 59:55.661
You know that big,
high bluff near Millertown?

59:55.869 --> 59:57.746
Yes, there was a bad accident there.

59:57.955 --> 01:00:01.124
They showed the pictures on television.

01:00:02.042 --> 01:00:03.043
I was in it.

01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:04.127
How can you...

01:00:04.336 --> 01:00:06.922
It doesn't matter how.
I was driving a stolen car.

01:00:07.005 --> 01:00:10.967
That's a fine thing! Do you enjoy
doing this to me, or what?

01:00:11.176 --> 01:00:14.095
- You wanted him to make a list!
- Let him tell it!

01:00:14.304 --> 01:00:15.847
She doesn't care!

01:00:16.056 --> 01:00:19.392
You remember how I almost died
giving birth to him?

01:00:19.601 --> 01:00:22.812
- And then you say I don't care!
- Please relax, relax!

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:29.152
Dad...

01:00:30.153 --> 01:00:33.072
I said it was a matter of honor.

01:00:33.573 --> 01:00:34.657
Remember?

01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:39.579
They called me chicken.

01:00:41.247 --> 01:00:43.749
You know? Chicken?

01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:49.797
I had to go.

01:00:59.473 --> 01:01:02.768
If I didn't, I'd never be able
to face those kids again.

01:01:07.773 --> 01:01:09.983
I got in one of those cars...

01:01:10.484 --> 01:01:13.737
and Buzz, one of those kids,
he got in the other car...

01:01:13.945 --> 01:01:16.281
and we had to drive fast...

01:01:16.615 --> 01:01:19.367
and then jump before the car
came to the edge.

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:22.120
And I got out okay and Buzz didn't.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.791
And it killed him.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:28.960
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

01:01:29.127 --> 01:01:31.004
You just get it off your chest.

01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:33.840
That is not what I mean!

01:01:35.633 --> 01:01:38.219
I have never done anything right.

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:41.806
I've been going around with
my head in a sling for years.

01:01:42.473 --> 01:01:45.852
I don't want to drag you into this,
but I can't help it.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.562
You see, I think...

01:01:48.813 --> 01:01:53.651
you can't just go around proving
things and pretending like you're tough.

01:01:53.859 --> 01:01:54.860
That's right.

01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:58.155
And even though you got to
look a certain way...

01:01:58.364 --> 01:02:00.991
- You're absolutely right!
- You look, you feel...

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.494
You're not listening to me!

01:02:03.994 --> 01:02:06.747
You're involved in this, just like I am!

01:02:07.956 --> 01:02:11.168
I'm going to the police
and telling them I'm involved.

01:02:11.335 --> 01:02:12.544
Did anyone see you?

01:02:12.753 --> 01:02:15.631
- Did anyone see your license plate?
- I don't know!

01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:17.966
Will the others go to the police?

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:20.177
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

01:02:20.385 --> 01:02:23.430
- Why be the only one involved?
- Far be it from me...

01:02:23.638 --> 01:02:26.308
Do we have to listen to a sermon now?

01:02:26.516 --> 01:02:28.393
I'm telling him what you mean.

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:32.105
You can't be idealistic all your life.
Nobody thanks you for...

01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:35.358
- Except to yourself!
- Wait a minute!

01:02:35.525 --> 01:02:37.193
Except yourself.

01:02:38.862 --> 01:02:40.196
You don't want me to go?

01:02:41.406 --> 01:02:43.700
No, I don't want you to go to the police.

01:02:43.866 --> 01:02:46.369
Why should you be the only one involved?

01:02:46.577 --> 01:02:50.414
But I am involved! We are all involved!

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:55.378
A boy, a kid was killed tonight!

01:02:56.087 --> 01:02:58.923
I can't get out of it and
pretend it didn't happen!

01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:02.218
Well, you know
that you did the wrong thing.

01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:04.845
- That's the main thing.
- That's nothing.

01:03:05.054 --> 01:03:07.806
That is absolutely nothing. Dad, you said...

01:03:08.015 --> 01:03:11.310
you want me to tell the truth.
Didn't you say that?

01:03:15.647 --> 01:03:17.191
You can't turn it off.

01:03:17.399 --> 01:03:21.194
He's not saying that.
He's saying just don't volunteer!

01:03:21.987 --> 01:03:23.739
Just tell a little white lie.

01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:26.867
You'll learn! When you're older, Jim.

01:03:27.617 --> 01:03:30.871
Well, I don't think
that I want to learn that way.

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:33.832
It doesn't matter anyway,
because we're moving!

01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:35.917
Don't tear me loose again.

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:38.753
- Just why are we moving?
- Must I spell it out?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.673
- You won't use me as an excuse again!
- I don't!

01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:44.092
When you can't face yourself
you blame me!

01:03:44.259 --> 01:03:45.718
That is not true!

01:03:46.553 --> 01:03:49.097
You say it's because of me
or the neighborhood!

01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:51.974
You use every other phony excuse!

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.895
Mom, I just...
Once, I want to do something right!

01:03:56.103 --> 01:03:59.065
And I don't want you
to run away from me again!

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.030
- This is all going too fast.
- You better give me something.

01:04:06.238 --> 01:04:08.407
You better give me something fast.

01:04:08.616 --> 01:04:10.242
Jimmy, you're very young.

01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:13.120
A foolish decision now
could wreck your whole life!

01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:16.623
- In ten years you won't know it happened.
- Dad, answer her.

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:19.668
Tell her.

01:04:21.378 --> 01:04:22.963
Ten years.

01:04:25.257 --> 01:04:27.509
Dad, let me hear you answer her.

01:04:41.606 --> 01:04:43.525
Dad, stand up for me.

01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:55.995
Stand up!

01:04:57.997 --> 01:04:59.165
You'll kill him!

01:05:02.001 --> 01:05:03.252
You're killing him!

01:05:03.711 --> 01:05:05.504
You want to kill your own father?

01:05:43.667 --> 01:05:46.878
- See how they brought us in like that?
- Let go of me!

01:05:47.087 --> 01:05:49.255
You want a good crack in the mouth?

01:05:49.464 --> 01:05:51.758
Take it easy, Ed. The boy's on edge.

01:05:52.008 --> 01:05:54.511
- Come on.
- He shouldn't talk to me that way.

01:05:54.719 --> 01:05:56.763
After all, I am his father.

01:05:57.347 --> 01:05:59.807
This place appeal to you or something?

01:06:07.982 --> 01:06:10.318
- What's he going to pull?
- Nothing, Crunch.

01:06:10.526 --> 01:06:13.863
- Did you see any cops with him?
- He was pulled in like us.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.575
Hey, excuse me.
Can you tell me where I can find...

01:06:18.617 --> 01:06:21.120
I forgot his name.
He works in the juvenile...

01:06:21.328 --> 01:06:22.580
Can't you see I'm writing?

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.959
He's going to tell, man. I know.

01:06:28.002 --> 01:06:29.670
Nobody arrested him.

01:06:30.295 --> 01:06:31.672
I think I better go home.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.507
Hey, wait, man.

01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:36.134
We'll have some kicks, huh?

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:40.847
- Crunch, my father...
- We'll bring him down.

01:06:41.056 --> 01:06:42.432
What do you say?

01:06:48.688 --> 01:06:50.357
You're going to clobber him?

01:06:52.317 --> 01:06:54.694
What, are you out of your mind? Come on.

01:06:55.904 --> 01:06:59.032
- What I could write about you...
- I remember his name.

01:06:59.199 --> 01:07:01.034
- What's the charge?
- Assault.

01:07:01.201 --> 01:07:04.704
- His name is Ray. I'd like to see him.
- He's not here.

01:07:04.913 --> 01:07:06.414
He's not in Juvenile Hall.

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:09.709
I don't know where he is.
He'll be out all night.

01:07:09.876 --> 01:07:10.960
How old are you?

01:07:11.419 --> 01:07:14.297
My parents know I'm here.
They know I'm out here.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.383
Come back in the morning, will you?

01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:19.176
Well, can I wait?

01:07:20.052 --> 01:07:22.013
Have you ever been booked before?

01:07:22.513 --> 01:07:24.056
Solid.

01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:53.835
Hello?

01:07:54.377 --> 01:07:55.670
Who wants her?

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:57.464
Who?

01:07:58.131 --> 01:07:59.591
Jim who?

01:08:00.258 --> 01:08:01.760
I never heard of you!

01:08:04.637 --> 01:08:07.015
He didn't have to hang up on him.

01:08:40.005 --> 01:08:41.423
Hello, Jamie.

01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:43.884
Jamie?

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.935
Where'd you get that?

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:02.484
How long have you known Plato?

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.325
About...

01:09:10.076 --> 01:09:12.453
- Coming up, another request.
... this morning.

01:09:12.662 --> 01:09:15.832
This time, from the boys
at Anna's Pizza Paradise.

01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:19.002
A new arrangement
of an oldie in rhythm and blues.

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:21.504
Jim, this is dedicated to you...

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:23.296
from Buzz.

01:09:41.357 --> 01:09:43.108
They'll be looking for you.

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:48.529
I didn't chicken. You saw where I jumped.

01:09:48.697 --> 01:09:50.783
What do I have to do, kill myself?

01:09:51.867 --> 01:09:54.161
It doesn't matter to them.

01:09:55.662 --> 01:09:58.540
Well, I guess you're still pretty upset, huh?

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:02.252
I'm just numb.

01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:11.636
You know something?

01:10:14.055 --> 01:10:16.391
I woke up this morning, you know?

01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:20.562
And the sun was shining...

01:10:21.104 --> 01:10:22.939
and it was nice...

01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:25.400
and all that type of stuff.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.861
And the first thing, I saw you.

01:10:32.115 --> 01:10:33.241
And I said:

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:37.370
"This will be one terrific day,
so you better live it up...

01:10:37.578 --> 01:10:41.040
because tomorrow you'll be nothing. "

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:43.667
See? And I almost was.

01:10:45.586 --> 01:10:47.046
I'm sorry.

01:10:48.589 --> 01:10:51.258
I'm sorry that I treated you mean today.

01:10:52.593 --> 01:10:56.096
Don't believe what I say
when I'm with the rest of the kids.

01:10:57.056 --> 01:10:59.892
Nobody acts sincere.

01:11:12.988 --> 01:11:14.447
Why did you do that?

01:11:14.614 --> 01:11:16.283
I felt like it.

01:11:19.911 --> 01:11:21.705
Your lips are soft.

01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:32.632
Where are you going?

01:11:32.715 --> 01:11:34.133
I don't know.

01:11:38.679 --> 01:11:40.306
We can't stay here.

01:11:51.025 --> 01:11:52.735
I know one thing.

01:11:54.653 --> 01:11:58.157
- I'm not going back in that zoo.
- I'm never going back!

01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:06.832
Listen...

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.921
I know a place. Plato told me before.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.090
It's an old, deserted mansion...

01:12:15.507 --> 01:12:17.342
up by the planetarium.

01:12:18.844 --> 01:12:20.512
Want to go up there with me?

01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:31.022
You can trust me, Judy.

01:12:37.904 --> 01:12:39.989
Okay.

01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:58.007
- What do you want?
- Your friend!

01:12:58.215 --> 01:13:00.467
Yeah, we got eyes for him. You know it?

01:13:01.468 --> 01:13:04.596
- Where does he live?
- You guys better beat it!

01:13:04.805 --> 01:13:06.390
Where does he live?

01:13:06.598 --> 01:13:08.016
Tell us! Tell us!

01:13:08.225 --> 01:13:10.477
- Leave me alone!
- Where does he live?

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.146
Get him! Come on!

01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:18.860
We want your friend!

01:13:20.737 --> 01:13:22.906
I got it! I got his address book!

01:13:23.115 --> 01:13:24.658
Your friend talked!

01:13:24.866 --> 01:13:25.951
Now you talk!

01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:27.827
Talk! Talk!

01:13:28.745 --> 01:13:30.580
What are you doing to him?

01:13:32.457 --> 01:13:34.709
Let's get out of here!

01:13:35.752 --> 01:13:37.754
- Did you get the book?
- Got it!

01:14:01.277 --> 01:14:04.572
Why you want to mix up with
bad boys like that?

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.616
Why you want to get into trouble
all the time?

01:14:09.201 --> 01:14:12.121
What you doing with that?
You put that down!

01:14:12.287 --> 01:14:14.748
Put it down before you hurt yourself!

01:14:14.957 --> 01:14:16.333
I have to warn him!

01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:21.380
You stay home, John!

01:14:24.299 --> 01:14:25.967
Bill Sibley.

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:30.305
Sam Stuart.

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:32.891
Stark. Jim Stark. Here it is.

01:14:33.099 --> 01:14:36.311
1753 Angelo. Well, well!

01:14:43.651 --> 01:14:45.069
Frank, I'm frightened!

01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:47.655
- What's that pounding?
- I don't know.

01:14:47.822 --> 01:14:50.783
At first I thought it was Jim...
He's not home yet.

01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:53.619
He's home, dear. I heard his car.

01:14:54.037 --> 01:14:58.040
- Well, are you going down there?
- Look, will you please relax?

01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:00.501
Now, you see?

01:15:01.043 --> 01:15:02.336
It stopped.

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:06.674
I still think you ought to go down there.

01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:23.816
Who's there?

01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:27.027
Anybody there?

01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.197
Open it.

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:43.918
Who's out there?

01:15:45.295 --> 01:15:48.214
- Where's your son?
- Where's your baby boy gone to?

01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:51.050
- We want to talk to him.
- He's not here.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.223
Look in his room!

01:16:04.897 --> 01:16:05.898
Son?

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:16.909
Is he there?

01:16:17.118 --> 01:16:19.119
No, honey, he's not here.

01:16:28.712 --> 01:16:31.298
- What are you doing?
- Do you know where Jim is?

01:16:31.423 --> 01:16:33.258
No, I don't know.

01:16:33.467 --> 01:16:35.260
Do you know where he is?

01:16:38.013 --> 01:16:39.264
I think...

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:45.645
I'm sorry I bothered you.

01:16:45.854 --> 01:16:47.439
Hey, come back here!

01:16:47.606 --> 01:16:48.898
Who are you?

01:17:26.227 --> 01:17:27.728
Careful, Jim.

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:48.665
Those noisy neighbors.

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:52.210
Come on!

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.507
Jim, it's me.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.185
They're looking for you.

01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:12.271
Everybody.
Crunch and Goon and everybody!

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.523
We know.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.734
They think you told the police on them.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.361
They're going to...

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.033
Who's in there?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.744
Nobody. Just us chickens.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:30.623
Who's in there?

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.875
Judy. Judy's up there.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.046
- Let me in?
- Yeah. All right.

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.214
But your house is a mess.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:44.720
Watch out.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.392
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:04.322
Well, we're safe here.

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.074
I hope.

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:13.164
What do you think of my castle?

01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:20.171
Well, now, there, then...

01:19:20.379 --> 01:19:22.715
I think we'll take it for the summer.

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:24.592
Right this way.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.639
Would you like to rent it?

01:19:29.847 --> 01:19:33.100
Or are you more in the mood to buy, dear?

01:19:33.976 --> 01:19:35.895
You decide, darling.

01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:39.231
- Remember our budget.
- Don't give it a thought.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.276
It's only $3,000,000 a month.

01:19:44.528 --> 01:19:45.779
We can manage that.

01:19:45.863 --> 01:19:49.283
I'll scrimp and save
and work my fingers to the bone.

01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:51.577
You see, we're newlyweds.

01:19:52.578 --> 01:19:54.246
Oh, there's just one thing.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:55.789
What about...?

01:19:57.124 --> 01:19:58.458
Children?

01:20:00.085 --> 01:20:01.962
Right this way.

01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:03.797
Yes.

01:20:04.297 --> 01:20:06.633
We really don't encourage them.

01:20:06.967 --> 01:20:09.010
They're so noisy and troublesome.

01:20:09.219 --> 01:20:10.720
Don't you agree?

01:20:11.262 --> 01:20:13.098
And so annoying when they cry.

01:20:13.306 --> 01:20:16.434
I don't know what to do when they cry.
Do you, dear?

01:20:16.643 --> 01:20:18.311
Drown them like puppies!

01:20:19.145 --> 01:20:22.148
The nursery's far away
from the rest of the house.

01:20:22.315 --> 01:20:23.733
Forgot to wind your sundial.

01:20:23.816 --> 01:20:27.945
If you have children,
you'll find this is a wonderful arrangement.

01:20:29.322 --> 01:20:31.449
They can carry on and you won't notice.

01:20:31.657 --> 01:20:33.409
A sunken nursery!

01:20:33.826 --> 01:20:37.955
In fact, if you lock them in,
you'll never have to see them again.

01:20:38.164 --> 01:20:40.249
- Much less, talk to them.
- Talk to them?

01:20:40.458 --> 01:20:43.794
- Nobody talks to children.
- No, they just tell them.

01:20:46.839 --> 01:20:48.215
What time is it?

01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:51.051
Hang loose. We've got all night.

01:20:51.468 --> 01:20:55.180
I wonder if the maid could tell
who we were if she saw us again.

01:20:55.347 --> 01:20:56.598
Sure she could.

01:20:57.266 --> 01:20:58.392
I know she could.

01:20:58.684 --> 01:21:00.560
You still want to go home, Moose?

01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:03.980
Then shut your mouth...

01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:06.191
before your guts run out.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.529
Quick, fill the pool!

01:21:16.034 --> 01:21:18.078
Let's see how long we can stay under.

01:21:20.038 --> 01:21:22.081
You can't talk underwater.

01:21:44.895 --> 01:21:46.772
I never saw you having so much fun.

01:21:46.981 --> 01:21:50.109
I came here a lot of times before,
but I never had fun.

01:21:50.317 --> 01:21:51.652
Why not?

01:21:52.278 --> 01:21:53.862
Because I was alone.

01:21:58.659 --> 01:22:00.327
All right!

01:22:02.329 --> 01:22:04.039
What'd you come back here for?

01:22:04.248 --> 01:22:07.209
Because I'd run away.
I used to run away a lot...

01:22:07.417 --> 01:22:09.086
but they always took me back.

01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:10.170
Who?

01:22:10.587 --> 01:22:12.005
Mom and Dad.

01:22:13.423 --> 01:22:15.717
Now that I don't have them I wish...

01:22:16.426 --> 01:22:18.261
I never had run away.

01:22:19.638 --> 01:22:21.765
I used to lie in my crib at night...

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:24.225
and I'd listen to them fight.

01:22:24.851 --> 01:22:26.936
Can you remember back that far?

01:22:28.563 --> 01:22:31.941
I can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

01:22:33.568 --> 01:22:34.944
I can't.

01:22:35.945 --> 01:22:36.863
How do you do it?

01:22:36.946 --> 01:22:39.782
I went to a head shrinker.
He made me remember.

01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:40.825
Did he?

01:22:41.033 --> 01:22:45.246
Then my mother said it cost too much,
so she went to Hawaii instead.

01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:49.375
Well, what's your problem?

01:22:49.792 --> 01:22:51.293
I don't know...

01:22:52.628 --> 01:22:54.046
but I'm happy now.

01:22:54.713 --> 01:22:55.881
Here.

01:22:56.632 --> 01:22:58.884
I wish we could stay here.

01:23:02.096 --> 01:23:03.764
Where's your father now?

01:23:06.225 --> 01:23:07.476
He's dead.

01:23:08.685 --> 01:23:10.979
He was a hero in the China Sea.

01:23:14.358 --> 01:23:16.818
You told me he was
a big wheel in New York.

01:23:19.654 --> 01:23:20.947
I did?

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.159
What's the difference?

01:23:24.951 --> 01:23:26.870
He might as well be dead anyway.

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:29.998
It's all right.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:34.919
Sure. Sure.

01:23:45.763 --> 01:23:47.890
I wonder how many rooms in this place?

01:23:48.808 --> 01:23:51.477
I don't know. A lot, probably.

01:23:51.978 --> 01:23:53.354
Probably.

01:23:58.192 --> 01:24:00.027
Do you want to explore?

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:44.279
Must have been a nervous day.

01:24:44.737 --> 01:24:46.906
He must have started out nervous.

01:24:48.408 --> 01:24:50.535
I've done that, though. Haven't you?

01:25:27.529 --> 01:25:29.740
That looks like our boy's car, huh?

01:25:30.115 --> 01:25:31.992
Well, what do you know?

01:25:48.466 --> 01:25:51.010
Is this what it's like to love somebody?

01:25:51.386 --> 01:25:52.762
I don't know.

01:25:54.806 --> 01:25:57.725
What kind of a person
do you think a girl wants?

01:26:00.353 --> 01:26:01.312
A man.

01:26:04.482 --> 01:26:07.985
But a man who can be gentle and sweet.

01:26:08.903 --> 01:26:10.362
Like you are.

01:26:14.033 --> 01:26:17.161
And someone who doesn't
run away when you want them.

01:26:18.245 --> 01:26:21.623
Like being Plato's friend
when nobody else liked him.

01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:24.835
That's being strong.

01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:38.515
We're not going to be lonely anymore.

01:26:39.474 --> 01:26:41.309
Ever, ever.

01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:44.062
Not you or me.

01:26:45.522 --> 01:26:47.857
I love somebody.

01:26:48.733 --> 01:26:50.568
All the time I've been...

01:26:50.944 --> 01:26:53.196
looking for someone to love me.

01:26:54.364 --> 01:26:56.366
And now I love somebody.

01:26:57.992 --> 01:26:59.911
And it's so easy.

01:27:01.829 --> 01:27:03.623
Why is it easy now?

01:27:06.584 --> 01:27:07.960
I don't know.

01:27:08.878 --> 01:27:10.713
It is for me too.

01:27:12.548 --> 01:27:14.300
I love you, Jim.

01:27:15.092 --> 01:27:17.094
I really mean it.

01:27:20.389 --> 01:27:22.391
Well, I'm glad.

01:27:58.718 --> 01:27:59.928
Good morning.

01:28:15.276 --> 01:28:16.611
Let's take him!

01:30:29.073 --> 01:30:30.032
That's it.

01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:32.368
This is unit 17.

01:30:33.119 --> 01:30:36.914
We just zeroed gray Ford coupe, 1946.

01:30:37.123 --> 01:30:41.627
Observatory Drive and Crest Place.
Looks like housebreaking.

01:30:42.586 --> 01:30:45.089
Alert Juvenile and stand by to send help.

01:31:10.655 --> 01:31:12.282
Save me!

01:31:19.289 --> 01:31:20.623
Save me!

01:31:35.137 --> 01:31:36.806
Plato, what's with...?

01:31:40.059 --> 01:31:43.729
Why did you run out on me?
Why did you leave me alone?

01:31:47.024 --> 01:31:48.609
What's the matter with you?

01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:51.487
I thought you were someone else!

01:31:51.653 --> 01:31:53.322
Who? Plato, it's me! Look at me.

01:31:53.655 --> 01:31:54.698
What's the matter?

01:31:54.782 --> 01:31:57.242
Let me go! You're not my father!

01:31:57.659 --> 01:31:59.328
You're not my father!

01:32:08.003 --> 01:32:09.254
Halt!

01:32:09.713 --> 01:32:11.006
Halt!

01:32:13.174 --> 01:32:14.759
Come here, son.

01:32:16.469 --> 01:32:17.637
Come here.

01:32:18.054 --> 01:32:20.473
Walk over quietly. There won't be trouble.

01:32:32.735 --> 01:32:34.529
Cover the house. I'll get him.

01:32:52.046 --> 01:32:53.047
Halt!

01:33:25.245 --> 01:33:26.704
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

01:33:26.788 --> 01:33:28.665
- Let's go back!
- I'm going after him.

01:33:28.873 --> 01:33:32.085
- After he tried to shoot you?
- Stay down.

01:33:32.293 --> 01:33:35.338
He didn't mean it.
We shouldn't have left him.

01:33:35.838 --> 01:33:36.798
He needs us.

01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:40.093
He needed you maybe, but so do I.

01:33:40.343 --> 01:33:41.969
He needs you too.

01:33:50.102 --> 01:33:51.312
You okay?

01:33:54.857 --> 01:33:56.108
Come on.

01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:05.242
You should have heard him tonight.

01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:08.287
He was talking about you...

01:34:09.204 --> 01:34:11.790
like you were the hero in the China Sea.

01:34:16.044 --> 01:34:17.546
You know what he wanted?

01:34:18.922 --> 01:34:21.133
He tried to make us his family.

01:34:22.134 --> 01:34:24.177
I guess he just wanted us to be like...

01:34:25.387 --> 01:34:29.933
his...

01:34:38.816 --> 01:34:39.943
Halt!

01:34:43.321 --> 01:34:45.239
Jim, they're killing him!

01:35:19.481 --> 01:35:20.899
Come out of there!

01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:23.860
You're making it tough on yourself, kid.

01:35:24.069 --> 01:35:27.030
Come quietly now.
You didn't kill anybody yet.

01:35:59.228 --> 01:36:00.521
Need a little help here.

01:36:00.605 --> 01:36:02.440
We heard firing. He hit anybody?

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.899
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:07.236
We got a kook inside with a gun.
He wounded some kid.

01:36:07.611 --> 01:36:08.612
How'd he get in?

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:10.364
Smashed the front door.

01:36:10.614 --> 01:36:13.242
- Is there another entrance?
- Down in back.

01:36:14.326 --> 01:36:15.744
Seal him off.

01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:24.753
I don't understand. I don't understand.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.922
You pray for your children.

01:36:27.089 --> 01:36:31.093
You read about things like this
happening to other families...

01:36:33.595 --> 01:36:36.097
but never dream it
could happen to yours.

01:36:36.264 --> 01:36:37.390
The Observatory?

01:36:38.099 --> 01:36:39.935
Five housebreaking in area.

01:36:40.226 --> 01:36:42.395
Right. We'll proceed. Over.

01:36:43.438 --> 01:36:45.648
There are some other kids in trouble.

01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:47.650
You'll have to go with me.

01:36:47.734 --> 01:36:50.278
Sure, sure. That's all right.

01:36:55.742 --> 01:36:57.577
Lieutenant says seal them off.

01:37:16.428 --> 01:37:17.805
Hello, Ray.

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:19.723
You know anything about this?

01:37:19.807 --> 01:37:21.058
No more than you do.

01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:22.976
A kid's in there with a gun.

01:37:23.143 --> 01:37:26.396
He wounded another kid
and shot at an officer.

01:37:27.147 --> 01:37:29.983
- You got a speaker?
- Yeah, help yourself.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.406
- What's going on?
- Some kid's in trouble. Stay back.

01:37:36.615 --> 01:37:39.826
I got to know! My boy ran off
and he got a gun too.

01:37:40.035 --> 01:37:41.828
All right. Lieutenant!

01:37:42.579 --> 01:37:44.956
I'm addressing the boy in the planetarium.

01:37:45.165 --> 01:37:47.000
I'm speaking to the boy inside.

01:37:47.792 --> 01:37:50.628
This is Ray Frameck
from the Juvenile Division.

01:37:51.421 --> 01:37:53.465
Armed police are outside.

01:37:53.923 --> 01:37:57.760
Whoever you are,
drop your weapon and come out.

01:37:59.429 --> 01:38:01.014
Come outside!

01:38:01.556 --> 01:38:06.018
Clasp your hands over your head
and come outside quietly.

01:38:08.646 --> 01:38:09.647
Mr. Stark!

01:38:10.022 --> 01:38:11.440
Frank!

01:38:14.777 --> 01:38:16.278
That's my son.

01:38:19.448 --> 01:38:20.574
Hold your fire!

01:38:24.662 --> 01:38:25.913
Are you sure?

01:38:26.288 --> 01:38:27.956
I think I know my son.

01:38:32.169 --> 01:38:36.256
Officers, another boy and girl
just ran into the planetarium.

01:38:36.465 --> 01:38:38.258
We don't know if they're armed.

01:38:38.467 --> 01:38:41.595
Hold your positions
until further instructions.

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.599
Another boy and girljust ran
into the planetarium.

01:38:45.807 --> 01:38:47.809
We don't know if they're armed.

01:38:48.059 --> 01:38:51.438
Hold your positions
until further instructions.

01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:54.482
You in there?

01:38:55.442 --> 01:38:57.736
You're my friend, Plato.

01:38:58.862 --> 01:39:00.697
That means a lot to me.

01:39:01.322 --> 01:39:04.158
Hey! I'm going to open the door now.

01:39:15.336 --> 01:39:17.296
You can shoot me if you want to.

01:39:25.262 --> 01:39:27.973
Boy, I'm blind as a bat.

01:39:28.224 --> 01:39:29.767
You got a match?

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.730
I'll break my neck in here.

01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:36.273
Where are you?

01:39:37.608 --> 01:39:39.193
I've got a gun.

01:39:42.279 --> 01:39:43.655
Yeah, I know.

01:39:47.367 --> 01:39:49.953
- Light a match, will you?
- No.

01:39:53.248 --> 01:39:54.541
How are you?

01:39:55.792 --> 01:39:57.377
I'm fine.

01:39:57.586 --> 01:39:59.129
That's fine.

01:40:08.304 --> 01:40:12.141
Do you think the end of the world
will come at nighttime?

01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:17.647
At dawn.

01:40:21.067 --> 01:40:22.818
Come on, now.

01:40:25.446 --> 01:40:26.822
Where are you?

01:40:34.163 --> 01:40:35.581
What are you hiding for?

01:40:35.789 --> 01:40:37.291
Just stand up.

01:40:38.167 --> 01:40:40.836
How can I talk to you if I can't see you?

01:40:42.171 --> 01:40:44.506
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

01:40:45.674 --> 01:40:47.301
Come on, stand up.

01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:51.221
You've seen this show before. Come on.

01:40:53.181 --> 01:40:55.058
Do you see that star up there?

01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.437
Stand up. Look at it.

01:41:00.605 --> 01:41:02.899
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

01:41:03.108 --> 01:41:04.609
That's all there is to it.

01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:18.706
I'm not going to hurt you
or anything like that.

01:41:26.255 --> 01:41:28.382
Why did you run out on me?

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.303
We didn't run out on you.

01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:35.264
We were coming right back, I told you.

01:41:35.473 --> 01:41:36.932
You sure?

01:41:38.017 --> 01:41:39.852
Sure, I'm sure.

01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:43.188
Judy's here.

01:41:44.023 --> 01:41:46.150
She's waiting. Come on.

01:41:47.443 --> 01:41:48.402
Come on.

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.824
No? Not ready to come out yet?

01:42:02.582 --> 01:42:04.751
Promise you, nothing will happen.

01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:09.589
Are you cold?

01:42:10.465 --> 01:42:11.466
Here.

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:16.679
It's warm. Here.

01:42:17.597 --> 01:42:19.557
My jacket. It's warm.

01:42:21.559 --> 01:42:23.061
Can I keep it?

01:42:23.269 --> 01:42:24.937
Well, what do you think?

01:42:30.151 --> 01:42:32.778
Hey, now can I have the gun, Plato?

01:42:32.945 --> 01:42:34.614
You want to give it to me?

01:42:36.616 --> 01:42:38.868
- My gun?
- Yeah. In your pocket.

01:42:39.076 --> 01:42:40.411
Give it to me.

01:42:50.462 --> 01:42:52.131
No, I need it.

01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:58.303
Don't you trust me, Plato?

01:43:00.597 --> 01:43:02.307
Just give it to me for a second.

01:43:11.983 --> 01:43:14.277
Been carrying this around all day?

01:43:22.494 --> 01:43:23.953
Now there's a...

01:43:25.955 --> 01:43:27.832
lot of people out front.

01:43:30.335 --> 01:43:32.295
You promised to give it back.

01:43:34.255 --> 01:43:36.507
Friends always keep their promises.

01:43:41.262 --> 01:43:42.763
These people...

01:43:44.515 --> 01:43:48.644
You know, every one
of them want to see that you're safe.

01:43:48.936 --> 01:43:50.646
You understand that?

01:43:51.188 --> 01:43:52.982
They want you to be safe.

01:43:55.192 --> 01:43:56.986
And... Oh, here.

01:43:57.444 --> 01:43:59.488
They said I could come in here...

01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:01.657
and I could bring you out, and...

01:44:01.865 --> 01:44:02.950
Why?

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:05.828
Why?

01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:08.455
Because they like you.

01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:13.877
Come on.

01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:33.563
It's too bright.

01:44:38.985 --> 01:44:40.361
I'll fix it.

01:44:54.083 --> 01:44:56.585
Is Ray Frameck still out there?

01:44:57.962 --> 01:44:59.171
Yes, I'm here.

01:45:00.798 --> 01:45:02.925
Hey, turn out those lights!

01:45:03.425 --> 01:45:05.260
If you do, we'll come out!

01:45:06.428 --> 01:45:07.930
Turn your lights out.

01:45:16.271 --> 01:45:18.106
See? Come on.

01:45:29.701 --> 01:45:30.577
Who's that?

01:45:31.953 --> 01:45:34.080
- Just a guy.
- I shot at one of them.

01:45:34.289 --> 01:45:36.416
It's all right. You didn't hurt him.

01:45:36.624 --> 01:45:38.543
Those are not my friends!

01:45:39.377 --> 01:45:41.129
Make them go away.

01:45:43.631 --> 01:45:47.927
You want me to make them go away?
You want me to fix it? Okay.

01:45:53.474 --> 01:45:56.060
Ray, can you make those guys get back?

01:45:56.268 --> 01:45:59.063
You don't have to worry
about anything. Here.

01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:00.898
Keep the guys back.

01:46:02.066 --> 01:46:04.151
That other kid still has a gun.

01:46:08.155 --> 01:46:10.491
Don't turn on the lights! It's too bright.

01:46:10.658 --> 01:46:13.285
Plato doesn't... Turn out the lights!

01:46:26.339 --> 01:46:28.300
I got the bullets!

01:46:28.967 --> 01:46:30.510
Look!

01:46:35.056 --> 01:46:36.099
Let him alone!

01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:38.601
Who are you? What do you want?

01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:41.271
All right, fellas. All right, Lieutenant.

01:46:44.065 --> 01:46:45.650
Get the stretcher in here.

01:46:46.067 --> 01:46:47.527
For a minute there, I...

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:50.363
When I saw that red jacket, I...

01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:51.823
I thought...

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:03.918
Hey, jerkpot...

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:07.296
what'd you do that for?

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:17.222
You can't help it, son.

01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:20.100
You did everything a man could.

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:46.418
Help me.

01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:51.839
You can depend on me.

01:47:52.048 --> 01:47:53.633
Trust me.

01:47:54.926 --> 01:47:58.179
Whatever comes, we'll face it together.

01:47:58.513 --> 01:48:00.014
I swear it.

01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:03.559
Now, Jim...

01:48:03.935 --> 01:48:05.269
stand up.

01:48:06.938 --> 01:48:08.773
I'll stand up with you.

01:48:09.315 --> 01:48:13.110
I'll try and be as strong
as you want me to be. Come on.

01:48:44.933 --> 01:48:49.020
This poor baby got nobody. Just nobody!

01:49:18.466 --> 01:49:20.468
He was always cold.

01:49:38.944 --> 01:49:40.445
This is Judy.

01:49:41.029 --> 01:49:42.197
She's my friend.

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:03.635
He's...
