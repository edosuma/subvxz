WEBVTT

00:06.720 --> 00:08.154
Thanks.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.671
Put that on my tab.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.160
Be right back.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.760
No strings attached. You just look
like you're having a tough night.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.991
Thank... Thank you.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.237
Lippinger-Carter, right?

00:21.400 --> 00:24.040
You looked familiar.
I've seen you in the elevator.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.395
Yeah.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.713
- Marketing.
- Portfolio management.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.310
- Which is what exactly?
- Boring.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.873
- Do you mind if I...?
- No.

00:36.640 --> 00:41.192
I have to warn you.
I am not very good company.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.350
No problem.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.873
And if you're looking for a good bridge
to jump off, I know all the best.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.674
Roosevelt's closest.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.992
Yeah, but Key Bridge is
so much more picturesque.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.392
- I'm Joe.
- I'm Philomena.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.832
Wait. Did anyone see us?

01:07.040 --> 01:09.157
No, we're good.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.753
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. This is stuck.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.074
What happened?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.479
Kaplan.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.514
- I thought...
- I was dead. I know.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.514
The reports were greatly exaggerated.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.391
A Katai Fellowship.
You do realize how prestigious that is.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.392
- When's the meeting?
- This afternoon.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.029
Panabaker's here,
and she does not look happy.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.669
Samar was nominated
for a Katai Fellowship.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.991
No kidding. That is so fantastic.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.514
We should see what she wants.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.197
- She can't hate me forever, right?
- That depends. Define "forever."

02:49.360 --> 02:52.671
Eighty-six bodies
at an ice rink in Reston.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.230
An anonymous tipster claims
every one of them...

02:55.440 --> 02:57.830
...is a former associate or competitor
of Reddington.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.799
- Yeah? And?
- Eighty-six bodies, Agent Ressler.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.156
- Eighty-six.
- Wasn't our idea to...

03:03.320 --> 03:05.880
...deal with the most dangerous
criminal in the western hemisphere.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.072
That decision was made
by Diane Fowler.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.120
Please, Harold. Is that the "just following
orders" card I hear slapping the felt?

03:12.280 --> 03:14.192
It wasn't my idea to be put in charge.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.717
Ressler was chasing after Reddington
for years to put him behind bars.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.357
- Keen has had her life turned inside out.
- I sympathize. Really, I do.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.592
But we've got a political hurricane
on our hands.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.911
And everybody is heading
to the storm cellar.

03:27.080 --> 03:32.030
And if they connect those bodies to you,
Main Justice will cut ties and disavow.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.671
<i>The A. G. has fast-tracked
an investigation into the bodies.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:40.392
<i>Way I hear it, man in charge on the case
is as wild as a peach-orchard hog.</i>

03:40.560 --> 03:42.517
Oh, what a stink.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.160
That stink...

03:45.880 --> 03:48.600
That stink is the smell of injustice.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.637
These people aren't victims.
They worked with Reddington.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.680
What's that supposed to mean, exactly?
That their wives didn't love them?

03:56.880 --> 03:59.236
That their kids don't miss them?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.755
That their murders
should go unsolved?

04:02.920 --> 04:07.153
Is that what you're saying,
"Officer Winchell"?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.636
You're messing with me, right?

04:12.640 --> 04:14.040
No.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.396
I ain't messing with you.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.156
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Officer Winchell.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.670
Special Agent Julian Gale.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.310
Now I'm gonna need some space.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.355
Everybody, I want this site clear.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.673
Yes, you. Let's go.
All of you, come on. Let's go.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.160
Everyone out.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.151
Thank you. And goodbye.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.797
I'm sorry.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.112
This is all my fault.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.514
Excuse me. Carl?

05:20.680 --> 05:24.754
Sorry to bother you at work. Ethan Begby.
Sheriff gave me your name and address.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.196
- Sheriff?
- No, no. Nothing like that.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.079
I'm looking for my Aunt Kate.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.950
I understand you picked her up
along the highway a few months ago.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.952
Apparently, someone happened to...

05:35.120 --> 05:38.955
...spot her in your truck
and mention it to the sheriff.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.920
She said her name was Sheila.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.279
I was afraid of that.
We think she was in an accident.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.478
We found her car in a ravine
along with her medication.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.199
Sweet as pie, Kate.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.477
And still fairly sharp
when she's on her meds.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.279
But without those pills...

05:54.440 --> 05:56.272
My ma had dementia
before cancer got her.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.751
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's a terrible, terrible thing.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.351
The whole family's been frantic
since she disappeared.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.080
- She was okay last I saw her.
- Yes?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.880
Where was that exactly?

06:12.960 --> 06:17.512
Good afternoon. I'd like to inquire
about one of your previous guests.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.071
- And you are?
- Officer Simmons, state police.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.515
I can always tell.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.832
Must be something in the voice.
So, what can I do you for, sir?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.550
I'm looking for a woman traveling alone.
She's gone missing.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.359
And all evidence indicates she...

06:31.520 --> 06:34.479
...may have stayed here
on the night of November 10th.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.996
- I'm hoping you have some record.
- Yeah.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.756
All right, let's see here.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.080
Yes, Sheila Barker.
Five nights. She paid cash.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.439
- Room 4.
- I need to look at that room.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.392
Your life as you know it is over, Joe.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.751
But I'm gonna give you
the chance I was denied.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.197
All you have to do is walk away.
Leave Raymond Reddington.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.477
I won't betray him.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.877
The answer is no.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.119
The person who unearthed the bodies
goes by the name of Mr. Kaplan.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.154
She's Reddington's cleaner
and one of his closest confidants.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.913
Why is she at war with him?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.631
- Ressler.
- I got two questions for you.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.793
One, what are you working on.
And two, can you get reassigned?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.037
<i>- Gale?
- Donny.</i>

07:24.200 --> 07:27.238
"Reassigned"? I didn't even
know you were still with the Bureau.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.110
Yeah. I mean,
I had to step away for a bit...

07:31.280 --> 07:32.999
...but I'm back.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.198
I'm standing in the middle of
a freezing cold ice-skating rink...

07:36.360 --> 07:38.079
...surrounded by 86 corpses.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.311
<i>The Bureau wanted me
to connect them to Reddington.</i>

07:40.520 --> 07:42.557
I called to see if
you want to work together.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.951
<i>- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?</i>

07:45.120 --> 07:47.396
Did you not hear?
We're talking about Reddington.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.836
Look, I heard what you said.
I'm just...

07:50.000 --> 07:51.673
<i>I'm just in the middle of something.</i>

07:51.840 --> 07:54.878
Okay. Well, does it involve
bringing down Reddington?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.191
<i>- Not exactly.
- Well, then it's not important.</i>

07:58.360 --> 08:00.272
Do me a favor. Think about it.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.636
Actually, no. Don't think about it...

08:02.800 --> 08:06.510
...and get your ass down here
so we can finally finish what we started.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.114
Everything okay?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.360
No, it's not.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.355
That was the peach-orchard hog.
The name's Julian Gale.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.434
We worked together on that Reddington
task force. He asked me to join him.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.838
Maybe you should. Keep up
with the investigation. Stay a step ahead.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.117
You don't need me to
stay one step ahead...

08:26.280 --> 08:30.593
...because I'll tell you right now
what he's gonna find. The truth.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.952
What must be known eventually...

08:33.120 --> 08:35.077
...should be known immediately.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.835
<i>- Yeah.
- Raymond?</i>

08:49.440 --> 08:51.636
We have a problem.
Peracchio has been arrested.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.479
What? How?

08:53.640 --> 08:57.156
<i>Trussed like a tom turkey and dumped
in front of the 9th precinct.</i>

08:57.320 --> 09:01.917
A detailed financial statement
tying him to you pinned to his chest.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.197
It would seem Kate
has started her endgame.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.239
<i>Pull the fire alarm, Marvin.
Let the others know. Go to ground.</i>

09:07.440 --> 09:09.238
- Got it.
- That includes you.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.955
Wherever you are, leave.
Assume you've been made.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.352
I didn't just get born, Raymond.
I've been at large for two years now.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.989
You're not safe. Nobody is.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.998
I'll be in touch.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.391
There something else
I can help you with?

09:41.600 --> 09:43.034
You're entirely too helpful.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.034
I wanna hear those tapes.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.917
I'm not some type of sicko, you know?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.594
People fascinate me.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.639
I'm not here to judge.
I just need to hear Sheila's tape.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.952
She was a peculiar one, a real loner.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.756
Hardly a word from her all day, and
then she'd cry like a baby in her sleep.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.516
I'd get it all because
the recorders are voice-activated.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.919
If you'll give me a minute, sir...

10:14.320 --> 10:18.314
<i>Hello, I'm staying at the Pine Needle
Motor Court. Do you deliver this way?</i>

10:18.680 --> 10:21.798
<i>No, no service today.
I only need a few clean towels, please.</i>

10:22.640 --> 10:25.917
<i>- Thank you for coming, Miss...?
- Please, call me Philomena.</i>

10:27.560 --> 10:29.711
<i>Please, call me Philomena.</i>

10:34.480 --> 10:37.040
She uses a mononym, "Philomena."

10:37.240 --> 10:40.836
This woman has elevated the rickety
practice of bounty-hunting...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.196
...to a sort of performance art.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.876
One of the most effective ways
to retrieve an unwilling target...

10:47.080 --> 10:52.235
...is to slip under their radar,
get close and make a friend.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.232
That's where Philomena shines.

10:54.400 --> 11:00.749
Sorry to interrupt, but Agent Keen told
us about Mr. Kaplan, and I need to ask.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.640
Is it true you shot her
because she tried to help Keen...

11:03.800 --> 11:05.792
...and her family escape
to a normal life?

11:05.960 --> 11:07.189
Yes.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.674
Unfortunately, Mr. Kaplan's efforts ran
counter to her intended consequence.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.550
Mr. Kaplan has told the authorities
about the ice rink.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.600
- The bodies.
- They've ordered an investigation.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.400
- I'm sure they have.
- This is a real problem.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.597
We're talking about 86 bodies.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.719
Not an innocent bystander
in the bunch, Harold.

11:27.880 --> 11:33.717
Still, 86. I suppose it's lucky they
haven't started popping up overseas.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.709
Still, in all, the problem we're talking
about, Harold, is a political one.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.752
Rest assured, your government will...

11:39.920 --> 11:42.594
...sweep this whole tawdry mess
under a rug...

11:42.800 --> 11:46.840
...providing we continue
to deliver the goods on my list.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.117
So, Philomena...

11:49.280 --> 11:53.752
<i>After studying her subject
for weeks or even months...</i>

11:53.920 --> 11:57.914
...and acquiring whatever skills
she might need along the way...

11:58.080 --> 12:00.640
<i>...Philomena enters her target's life...</i>

12:00.800 --> 12:05.397
<i>...as if by mere coincidence
or accident.</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:10.034
Oh, my God.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.032
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I think so.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.590
- No, don't move.
- No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm fine.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.240
- Oh, my God.
- I'm okay.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.676
At least let me pay
for the damage to your bike.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.633
Let's just exchange information. Okay?

12:20.840 --> 12:25.676
Philomena's patience and subtlety
are what make her so credible.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.992
And you think Mr. Kaplan
hired her to kidnap your finance guy?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.676
Joe Peracchio, yes.
And if my instincts are correct...

12:32.840 --> 12:35.560
...she's going after
more of my people right now.

12:35.720 --> 12:41.273
I'm off to see an individual who
I believe also employed her services.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.912
I suggest that you start at the bar
where Peracchio was last seen.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.515
Navabi, see what you can find
at the abduction site.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.878
- Keen, go with Reddington.
- So I get a babysitter now.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.470
I haven't had a babysitter
since Brenda Gilroy.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.599
My God, potpies, Lawrence Welk.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.640
Bath time with Brenda's
still my perfect Saturday night.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.112
- Excellent. Excellent.
- Can I help you?

13:11.280 --> 13:14.114
Yes, congratulations,
Congressman Edelstein.

13:14.280 --> 13:19.071
Aron's going to make you
and your wife very, very proud.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.312
- Do we know you?
- Howard Klein, the Swidlow bris?

13:23.920 --> 13:26.515
It's okay.
Just consider me a fellow traveler.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.320
One who understands
and appreciates...

13:29.480 --> 13:32.552
...the importance of
strong family bonds...

13:32.720 --> 13:36.031
...and the critical role
these milestones play in forging them.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.591
Yes, of course. It's the small things.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.319
Like bricks in a fortress.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.440
And well worth defending, by the way,
or hiring someone to defend.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.798
Like Philomena, for instance.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.030
Can you give us a moment?

14:00.520 --> 14:01.715
Who the hell are you?

14:01.880 --> 14:06.830
You engaged Philomena to compromise
a certain tennis instructor...

14:07.000 --> 14:08.957
...at the Town & Country
Racquet Club...

14:09.160 --> 14:12.551
...who was carrying on a long-term
fervid affair with your wife.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.031
Thereby preserving your marriage
for this happy occasion.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.590
His name was Chip.
What kind of name is that, "Chip"?

14:18.760 --> 14:20.752
Short for something?
"Chipper"? "Chipwick"?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.440
What do you want? Money?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.877
All I want is to know the means
by which you contacted Philomena.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.759
Consider it a mitzvah.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.631
There's a place on 29th,
Randy's Boot Emporium.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.157
<i>You go to the repair counter in the back
and ask for Ticket 652.</i>

14:40.320 --> 14:43.757
<i>After you've been vetted,
if you're cleared, you'll get a call.</i>

14:46.880 --> 14:48.792
Sir, Mr. Reddington was right.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.600
Twenty seconds after he left,
the owner made a call.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.913
I'm tracing it now, but the root package
is hidden within layers of encryption.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.591
D.C. Metro found Peracchio's car
abandoned in Adams Morgan.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.549
There's not much to go on, but they did
find traces of cement powder on the mat.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.832
- Cement powder?
- It was mixed with copper.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.276
Which indicates the powder
was transferred...

15:08.440 --> 15:10.272
...from an active construction site.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.080
Dispatch ERT to gather samples
from construction sites...

15:13.240 --> 15:15.197
...starting where they recovered the car.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.671
I'll do it. Navabi has her interview
for the Katai Fellowship today.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.871
How could I forget? Good luck.
They'd be lucky to have you.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.240
- Special Agent Donald Ressler.
- Good to see you too, Julian.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.030
Get the hand out of here.
Good to see you.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.199
- By the way, you're welcome.
- For what?

15:45.360 --> 15:47.397
- Inviting me to the morgue?
- For what?

15:47.560 --> 15:50.871
For yanking you away from what
the Bureau's got you on to do real work.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.236
Remember the leads
we used to have on Reddington...

15:53.400 --> 15:57.679
...that would just evaporate every time
some person of interest would vanish?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.309
Guess what. They're all here.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.830
They're no longer missing persons.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.151
Eighty-six bodies.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.154
What do you think that means?

16:07.360 --> 16:09.591
Eighty-six active
homicide investigations.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.591
You remember Tiger Branson, right?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.913
Lou Capote?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.398
- Junior...
- Wallace.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.029
Jesus, these are guys
that we all tried to turn.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.793
Guys that we got killed.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.480
Look, Don.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.114
This is our chance to wash
the blood off our hands.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.670
We won't get Reddington
with the Capotes of the world.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.395
These are just scumbags
nobody cares about.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.278
Ladies, can I have a second?
Thank you.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.636
Agent Ressler,
I'd like for you to meet...

16:39.800 --> 16:42.998
...the former head of the Criminal Division
of the Justice Department.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.719
- Miss Diane...
- Fowler.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.635
Miss Diane Fowler.
This, these bodies...

16:48.800 --> 16:50.678
...they're a big, wet kiss
on the mouth.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.355
I don't know who the kiss is from,
but whoever it is...

16:53.520 --> 16:56.558
...they obviously want Reddington's head
as badly as we do.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.317
I didn't think that was possible.
I wanna show you something else.

17:04.359 --> 17:08.400
- Tell me, how's Tom?
- He's having a hard time actually.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.755
Is he?

17:10.440 --> 17:14.832
Finding out truths about
who you really are is never easy.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.792
- How's Agnes?
- She's amazing.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.679
May I come up and see her?

17:22.839 --> 17:25.958
- If you'll do something for me.
- Name it.

17:26.119 --> 17:30.751
When I thought you killed
Mr. Kaplan, I felt responsible.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.832
Not just responsible, I felt complicit.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.437
It wasn't about you.
She made her choice. Her, not you.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.593
Yes, but she did it for me.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.672
Can't you see that if you hurt her,
you are hurting me?

17:44.840 --> 17:48.720
I will help you stop her,
but I will not let you hurt her.

17:48.960 --> 17:53.239
Now, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me you won't harm her.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.955
I can't do that, Elizabeth.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.680
Then you can't come up.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.712
I haven't laid eyes on Agnes
since the night I helped you escape.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.879
So big.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.516
Whatever are you feeding her?

18:39.840 --> 18:42.878
You risked your life for our family,
and he shot you for it.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.760
He shot you.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.914
I can never make that right, but I can
protect you. I can keep you safe.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.515
That would mean
I'd have to take you into custody.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.672
You are safe.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.752
You are loved.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.636
You are wise.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.830
Where did you hear those words? I...

19:02.000 --> 19:03.354
I know those words.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.239
Yes, dear, you know them because...

19:05.400 --> 19:08.711
...I said them to you many times a day
when you were a baby.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.750
That can't be true.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.351
Regular affirmations
build a child's self-confidence.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.871
You're proof of that.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.717
It's no surprise you don't remember,
with all you've been through.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.960
You and I were very close once.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.635
You knew me as "Katya."

19:30.280 --> 19:32.511
I was your nanny.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.520
I don't believe you.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.876
Your mother hired me to care for you.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.239
I promised her that
I would defend you with my life.

19:43.240 --> 19:48.440
The reason I'm telling you this now is so
that you'll listen to me when I beg you.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.875
Walk away.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.437
I gave the authorities enough
to put him away forever.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.913
But you and your team must disavow
any knowledge of the task force.

19:58.080 --> 20:02.040
So you served Reddington
up on a silver platter to the FBI.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.080
- You did that for me?
- Not you, Elizabeth.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.956
I've already failed you.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.355
I did it for Agnes.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.236
I can protect my own daughter just fine,
thank you.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.352
Like you did today?

20:17.840 --> 20:21.675
What if I was one of Raymond's enemies
that would do anything to get at him?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.320
Please...

20:23.480 --> 20:28.111
...do what your mother never had
the courage to do until it was too late.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.480
Walk away from Raymond.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.119
- Hello?
- Bronwyn, hi. It's Alexa.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.600
I'm the one who hit you with my car.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.319
Oh, yeah, right.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.631
<i>My insurance agent
would kill me for calling...</i>

21:06.800 --> 21:08.678
...but I need to know that you're okay.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.479
<i>I'm okay, thanks.</i>

21:10.640 --> 21:12.597
<i>- Did you see a doctor yet?
- Didn't need to.</i>

21:12.760 --> 21:15.673
<i>No, you... You can't be too careful
with head injuries.</i>

21:15.920 --> 21:17.718
<i>No, I... Really. I wasn't hurt.</i>

21:17.920 --> 21:19.320
Okay.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.550
Well...

21:20.720 --> 21:23.918
...if it's a matter of money,
maybe I could help out?

21:24.920 --> 21:26.593
Hello?

21:27.240 --> 21:28.640
Bronwyn?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.075
<i>- It's just...
- What's wrong?</i>

21:30.240 --> 21:32.038
My husband...

21:32.200 --> 21:34.920
My ex-husband, I...

21:35.080 --> 21:39.916
I left him, and we're in a custody battle.
He's trying to steal my little girl...

21:40.080 --> 21:42.390
...and if he found out
that I caused an accident...

21:42.560 --> 21:45.473
Honey, you were on a bicycle.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.359
I should've been more careful.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.513
No, I just need to keep my job
and my head above water.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.160
What can I do? Just tell me.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.357
<i>I mean, you could just...</i>

21:54.520 --> 21:57.672
Just forget about me.
Just forget about the accident.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.480
<i>I'm so sorry. I have to go.</i>

22:12.600 --> 22:13.590
Is it true?

22:13.760 --> 22:15.797
- She was at my apartment.
- What did she want?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.280
Clear shot at Reddington.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.949
- That won't happen.
- She knows. It's more of a wish.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.750
- A hope to protect Agnes.
- I got a hit on the trace.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.957
Payphone by a construction site
in Anacostia.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.396
There are vacant warehouses
all around that area.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.835
Could be our Blacklister.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.435
- I'm rolling out there now.
- Let's do it.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.234
Hey.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.476
So, what's all this?

22:43.640 --> 22:44.915
Diane Fowler's living room.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.356
It was catalogued,
crated and stored in evidence.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.399
Seems the Bureau spares no expense
for their leadership.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.157
We're gonna reconstruct
the whole scene.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.880
We're gonna dissect it
until we find what we need.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.833
This is extreme, even for you.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.275
I'm just getting warmed up.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.512
Are you working on
anything related to Reddington?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.473
Is anybody?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.679
You ever get a satisfactory answer...

23:07.840 --> 23:11.356
...as to why the task force
was disbanded by the Bureau?

23:11.760 --> 23:15.640
Why, all of a sudden, everyone
just gave up from minute to the next?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.359
You didn't, did you?

23:17.720 --> 23:19.359
Well, he flipped.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.272
Nobody's looking for Reddington
because he already turned himself in.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.519
That right there, what you just said,
is why I love you.

23:32.720 --> 23:37.158
- Because you're a crazy son of a bitch.
- Yeah. What can I say? I'm here to amuse.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.356
"He turned himself in."

23:38.560 --> 23:40.916
That... That's good.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.030
With you down for the count
the last few days...

23:46.200 --> 23:51.275
...I've felt the consequences
of your absence on my soul.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.474
So you bought me shoes?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.752
No, no, no. Not now.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.553
And not shoes.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.754
It's a parting gift.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.633
I don't understand, Raymond.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.396
Most of my associates
are under the impression that...

24:08.560 --> 24:13.760
...once I've granted them a favor,
they're indebted to me for life.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.310
But it's a false assumption.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.632
They're indebted to me
because I make them a lot of money.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.190
They're loyal to me
because I've earned it.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.991
It's good business.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.920
But at the end of the day, it's...

24:34.440 --> 24:36.636
...just business.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.510
In service of what?

24:42.720 --> 24:45.280
Safety? Security?

24:45.440 --> 24:48.990
Health and well-being
of the ones we love?

24:50.200 --> 24:53.193
Well, I really only have one friend.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.272
You're my friend.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.552
And I...

25:02.120 --> 25:06.478
I misjudged you in a way that no...

25:07.480 --> 25:09.915
...apology can suffice.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.351
I'm ashamed of that.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.959
I want you to...

25:19.160 --> 25:21.755
...keep that box,
and on the day you decide to leave...

25:21.920 --> 25:23.877
I'm not going to leave.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.560
But you can.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.836
At any point of your own choosing,
I'll insist that you do.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.390
No questions asked,
no debts accrued...

25:34.560 --> 25:38.474
...with our friendship intact
and flourishing.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.151
For we'll have new lands to discover.

25:42.680 --> 25:47.038
Not as coworkers, but as cohorts.

25:55.400 --> 25:59.599
Whether it's today, or tomorrow
or 10 years from now...

25:59.760 --> 26:02.195
...that's when you open the box.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.952
FBI!

26:15.120 --> 26:16.713
Move!

26:19.040 --> 26:20.713
Go right.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.919
I wonder how long
she's been staying here.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.397
"Alexa Feist."

26:33.560 --> 26:35.711
And who might you be?

26:35.880 --> 26:39.271
Missing a brown, leather chair.
Like that one. They were sold as a pair.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.114
It's clearly where Fowler was sitting
when she was shot.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.511
It's easier to throw out than to clean.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.439
They didn't find any trace evidence?

26:46.600 --> 26:48.751
No, and therein lies a tale.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.553
There was no unaccounted-for DNA.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.997
It all belonged to Fowler and to Teacup,
her... Her dog.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.914
Watch out,
Pomeranians have tiny bladders.

26:57.080 --> 27:01.438
Now, this chair.
No hairs, no fiber, no DNA.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.677
No nothing.
I mean, we're talking antiseptic.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.435
Obviously, cleaned by a professional.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.559
So the killer sits here.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.958
Directly across from the victim.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.920
<i>You're the dirty rat, Diane.</i>

27:27.760 --> 27:28.796
Hey.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.793
Relax, Donnie.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.559
Come on.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.672
All right, now, the turntable
was scrubbed of DNA...

27:37.880 --> 27:40.475
...so was the record that was on it.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.077
Gordon Lightfoot, "Sundown."

27:43.240 --> 27:45.755
So, what are you suggesting?
Reddington put on music...

27:45.960 --> 27:48.714
- ...after killing a woman in cold blood?
- No.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.798
The evidence suggests it.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.794
In addition,
a path was cleared of DNA...

27:53.960 --> 27:58.159
...from the killer's chair,
across the floor to that window.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.594
Now, that window pane
was cleaned at a center height of 5'10".

28:04.800 --> 28:07.599
- Reddington's height.
- Let's take that to a judge.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.992
I'm not saying we have enough
to hang the guy.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.072
I'm saying that we're...

28:13.240 --> 28:14.674
We're closing in.

28:19.440 --> 28:24.356
<i>I know the truth, Red.</i>

28:37.800 --> 28:40.269
<i>Do you think she's setting him up?</i>

28:40.440 --> 28:41.590
<i>Who?</i>

28:41.760 --> 28:43.319
<i>His cleaner.</i>

28:44.000 --> 28:47.118
Why'd you just say "she"?

28:47.720 --> 28:49.359
It fits Reddington's profile.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.115
He's extremely comfortable
in the company of women.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.751
- Guy's a gentleman, he's old-fashioned.
- Since when do you profile, Donnie?

28:56.480 --> 28:57.880
I mean...

28:58.040 --> 28:59.872
...you might be right, but...

29:00.680 --> 29:04.117
So he shoots Fowler,
he comes over here...

29:04.280 --> 29:06.237
...and he stares out the window.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.677
<i>He's listening to "Sundown."</i>

29:08.840 --> 29:12.629
<i>Strum of the guitar, the voice of a man
who's seen too much sorrow.</i>

29:13.120 --> 29:17.239
<i>You know, there is a chance this music
was on before Reddington got here.</i>

29:17.480 --> 29:20.757
<i>And I think you're right,
I think the cleaner is a woman.</i>

29:20.960 --> 29:24.032
She comes here,
she cleans the turntable.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.670
She cleans the album.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.796
But did she clean this?

29:38.160 --> 29:39.992
The record-cleaning brush.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.197
It's full of prints.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.232
Well, partner...

29:47.000 --> 29:49.834
...we're finally gonna nail Reddington.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.712
A skinny mocha latte.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.156
I'm not stalking you, I swear.
Well, I kind of am.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.313
- I need to talk to you for a minute.
- How'd you know where I work?

29:59.800 --> 30:02.190
You were wearing the shirt
when I hit you.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.951
Listen.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.471
I know it's hard
to be a young, working mother.

30:09.640 --> 30:13.554
No, no, this is just temporary. You know,
to show the courts I have a stable job.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.757
- I'm going back to school.
- My point exactly.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.630
To be doing all that alone
and fighting a spiteful husband in court...

30:19.800 --> 30:21.996
...you need help.
My brother's a trial attorney.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.231
Like, born with a silver tongue.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.631
Said he'd consider helping you
as a favor to me.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.031
Will you just meet with him?

30:29.920 --> 30:32.196
Yeah. That would be amazing.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.192
What's with the long face?

30:37.360 --> 30:39.431
We pulled a print off
the Fowler crime scene.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.273
- Reddington's?
- Possibly.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.676
If it is, it ties him to her murder.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.400
- Haven't run it yet.
- And you don't know if you should.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.950
No, I know I should, but if I do...

30:49.120 --> 30:51.316
...this could end,
and we might end up in jail.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.073
Remember that number?
Alexa Feist?

30:53.240 --> 30:56.631
- Did she finally answer?
- No, but I looked into who she is...

30:56.840 --> 30:58.638
...PTA, rotary club.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.360
Pure vanilla. Why would Philomena
be involved with her?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.718
Well, she isn't interested in her.
She's interested in her brother.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.475
Alex Feist's maiden name's "Gerard."

31:07.680 --> 31:10.559
- As in Marvin Gerard.
- Reddington's lawyer.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.912
Kaplan's using Philomena
to go after his closest allies.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.509
Marvin...

31:20.680 --> 31:23.673
...this is Bronwyn,
the woman I was telling you about.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.830
Open the door.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.593
Yeah, okay.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.680
<i>- Reddington.
- What's going on?</i>

31:34.840 --> 31:37.674
Marvin Gerard
is Philomena's next target.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.958
<i>She's pulling him out of hiding using
his sister. We're headed to her place.</i>

31:41.120 --> 31:42.634
No, first secure Marvin.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.635
I'll call to alert him you're coming.
Once he's safe, you see to the sister.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.240
Write down this address.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.511
Look, I can't represent you in court...

31:50.720 --> 31:54.760
...but I can draft up some briefs
that you can bring to any attorney.

31:54.920 --> 31:59.199
And your ex-husband,
he won't know what hit him.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.198
Wow, I don't... I can't thank you enough.
Both of you. I mean...

32:04.400 --> 32:06.790
It's the least I can do
after what I put you through.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.431
If you're gonna get hit by a car,
you can't do much better than my sister.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.240
She's been taking in
wounded animals her whole life.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.869
Yeah. That's what I hear.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.711
I thought you two just met?

32:18.920 --> 32:21.116
<i>- Hello?
- You've been targeted, Marvin.</i>

32:21.280 --> 32:22.839
<i>Our people are on their way.</i>

32:23.040 --> 32:25.271
<i>- Until they arrive, don't let anyone in.
- Marvin.</i>

32:25.440 --> 32:28.080
- Too late.
- Hang up.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.837
- I'm so sorry.
- Alexa, this is not your fault.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.834
She's a professional.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.830
This is what she does.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.910
Look, I will do whatever you want.
Just let my sister go.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.595
Well, that's good
because I'm only here for you.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.153
Hold it to your neck.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.640
- FBI! Hands up!
- Clear.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.074
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.430
Here.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.674
My brother, she took him.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.354
- How long ago?
- Ten minutes.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.029
- Did you see what she was driving?
- She drove me here.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.954
- A green SUV, gray interior.
- Did you see the license plate?

33:28.120 --> 33:29.713
- Any identifying marks?
- No.

33:29.960 --> 33:30.950
Aram.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.272
There was a barcode sticker
on my side window.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.913
It's a rental. The barcode's for scanning
the vehicle in and out.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.430
We found a local company
that rented a green SUV...

33:40.600 --> 33:42.239
...to a woman with her description.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.392
Does the vehicle have a GPS
we can track?

33:44.560 --> 33:48.474
The rental company already enabled
the stolen-vehicle recovery feature for us.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.593
We've tracked the target
heading south on 210.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.479
Agents Keen and Navabi are en route.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.432
That's her.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.754
Don't move!

34:27.520 --> 34:29.512
- Hands in the air.
- There's no one there.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.359
On your knees.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.550
Gerard.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.034
Where's Marvin Gerard?

34:48.480 --> 34:50.870
Hello, Marvin.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.391
I wish I could say
it was good to see you.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.679
Tell me how I can find Kaplan.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.114
- You're not leaving until I know.
- Why you worried about her?

35:02.320 --> 35:05.791
I mean, she's doing your job for you.
Going after Reddington.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.476
I'm trying to protect her.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.960
Sure you are.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.156
<i>Nothing?</i>

35:12.360 --> 35:15.831
No stream of invectives?
No mediation offers?

35:16.040 --> 35:19.078
- Perhaps a lecture on criminal ethics?
- What's the point?

35:19.480 --> 35:21.472
I'm looking at a dead woman.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.398
I've been underestimated before.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.399
Why the hell didn't you run?

35:28.040 --> 35:30.555
You survived a gunshot to the head.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.313
Lord knows how.

35:32.520 --> 35:35.115
That's the mother-loving lottery
right there.

35:35.640 --> 35:38.360
Take your ticket
and board a jet plane, sister.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.431
Why come back to this cesspool?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.358
To clean it up.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.155
You think maybe you're taking this
whole cleaner concept a bit too far?

35:51.360 --> 35:55.320
Look, it's pretty simple. Either we find
Kaplan first or Reddington does.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.989
Who do you think
she stands a better chance with?

35:58.160 --> 36:00.117
Put yourself in my shoes.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.830
How could I possibly believe
that you wanna protect Kaplan?

36:06.560 --> 36:10.474
Because I just found out
Kate Kaplan held me as a baby.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.957
I'm not cleaning Raymond's mess.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.351
I'm taking responsibility for my own.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.110
I enabled him, Marvin. You did too.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.595
He used us.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.400
That's an alternative truth.

36:24.880 --> 36:29.591
I provide Reddington with a service,
for which I am very well-compensated.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.989
He takes care of me.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.719
Does he?

36:33.800 --> 36:39.319
He forced the FBI to release you
from prison a week before your parole.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.315
So you could become his accomplice and
help him escape during a police standoff.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.355
You had a new fiancÃ©e at the time.
A whole life waiting.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.876
What do you have now, Marvin?

36:50.680 --> 36:51.830
Alone.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.590
On the run till you die?

36:56.240 --> 36:58.675
Unless you help yourself.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.231
I'm not turning
state's evidence against him.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.510
No way.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.918
I'm sorry to hear that, Marvin.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.557
I'm so honored that
you could meet me here.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.434
- Just to be considered...
- Katai Fellowships are designed...

37:26.640 --> 37:28.438
...to groom members
of law enforcement...

37:28.640 --> 37:31.838
...to become policy leaders
on a broader scale.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.552
Now, you've written extensively about
Islamophobia in law enforcement.

37:36.720 --> 37:41.749
As a female and a Muslim,
you've got a unique perspective on this...

37:41.920 --> 37:43.991
- ...perceived issue.
- I do.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.198
Enough to know that
it's not a perception, it's a reality.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.797
I'm sorry. You know what I mean.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.679
No, I don't.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.152
People are afraid.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.960
Because their leaders
tell them they should be.

37:57.120 --> 38:01.239
But since 9/11, 180,000 people have
died from gun violence in this country.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.552
Only 94 have been killed
by Muslim terrorists.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.037
That is what I would call
a perceived issue.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.032
I won't apologize for being passionate.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.677
Nor would I ask you to.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.320
Tell me about growing up in Iran.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.910
And?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.400
Didn't match.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.831
- What?
- The print. It's not Reddington's.

38:27.000 --> 38:27.990
That's impossible.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.594
Did they run it through AFIS?

38:29.800 --> 38:32.395
Yeah. The unsub wasn't in the system.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.676
Well, there you have it.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.399
The system's rigged.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.837
- What are you talking about?
- The system's rigged by Reddington...

38:39.040 --> 38:40.394
...for Reddington.

38:40.560 --> 38:44.873
It's the only explanation.
I mean, he's got somebody on the inside.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.512
- You said so yourself.
- I was kidding.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.995
Well, I'm not.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.350
What about that fed
he went on the run with?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.276
The one you hunted.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.156
That's our next move.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.679
We start with Elizabeth Keen.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.950
She finally turned.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.395
Kaplan's headed to Vienna.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.111
Springtime in Vienna.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.831
The markets are a bit crowded,
but the flowers. Oh, my gosh.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.158
A simple walk
to the U-bahn is full of glory.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.915
- I'll let you two talk.
- Like hell. Stay put.

39:27.080 --> 39:31.359
I'm contacting Homeland Security.
Then we'll come up with an action plan.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.079
Together.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.833
Excellent work, Agent Keen.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.673
How'd you do it?

39:40.840 --> 39:42.433
How'd you change the fingerprint?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.877
- The fingerprint?
- Don't play dumb.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.431
The one Gale and Ressler found that
connects you to Diane Fowler's death.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.637
I assure you, I know nothing of it.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.559
I heard about the fingerprints.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.712
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah, I know.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.192
I sent the prints in.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.080
Your guess is as good as mine
why they came back negative.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.630
You think Reddington
has someone else in his pocket?

40:06.840 --> 40:07.830
I don't know, maybe.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.953
But what I do know
is that working with Gale...

40:11.120 --> 40:14.909
I mean, the guy's an inspiration
and never lets anything slide, ever.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.151
Kind of reminds me
of the way I used to be.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.232
The Reven Wright case.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.720
Laurel Hitchin murdered her.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.396
I know that in my bones, and I'm not
gonna let this go until I can prove it.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.799
- Navabi.
- Congratulations, Agent Navabi.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.317
<i>I'm pleased to inform you the board
has selected you for the fellowship.</i>

40:34.480 --> 40:35.470
That's...

40:35.880 --> 40:38.873
Thank you so much.
I don't know what to say.

40:39.120 --> 40:42.431
No thanks necessary,
expect perhaps to Agent Mojtabai.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.559
He was the one
who recommended you.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.836
Agent Mojtabai?

40:47.000 --> 40:50.118
<i>Yes, he sang your praises
quite convincingly.</i>

40:52.560 --> 40:55.155
Is this your way of appeasing me?
With this fellowship?

40:55.320 --> 40:56.720
I know you nominated me.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.997
- Because you'd be perfect...
- Well, I got it.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.152
- That's amazing.
- I turned it down.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.233
I have wanted this for years.
You never nominated me before.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.512
I catch you in a lie, and all of a sudden,
you think I deserve it?

41:07.680 --> 41:09.637
- You do.
- Well, I deserved it a year ago.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.712
And the year before that.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.236
Help me please.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.315
Please.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.159
Thank you.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.397
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

41:30.600 --> 41:34.753
As we've explained to your counsel, the
Bureau will protect you and your family...

41:34.920 --> 41:36.798
...as long as you cooperate fully.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.191
Now, let's start from the beginning.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.432
Why don't you tell us how
you first met Raymond Reddington?

41:46.480 --> 41:47.675
Welcome to Milan.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.036
How long to Vienna?

41:50.200 --> 41:52.510
We'll be there in eight hours.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.712
Wake me in seven and a half.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.479
No problem.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.115
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.396
You should be resting.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.199
I'm tired of resting.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.275
We should find Kate.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.279
Okay.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.119
Let's get some supper first.
