on my horse?

00:09.317 --> 00:10.650
That's Georgie.

00:10.718 --> 00:11.919
I said she could go riding

You're-you're giving me

00:24.999 --> 00:27.200
You know what, Amy?
I really appreciate your input,

00:27.268 --> 00:28.834
but I've worked
with dozens of racehorses;

Janice.

00:32.238 --> 00:33.506

to marry me

06:21.834 --> 06:23.534
Miranda, Shane,
school tuition,

06:23.602 --> 06:26.904
the money that I lost
on that bison,

06:26.972 --> 06:29.673
and owning a racehorse
comes at a steep price.

06:29.742 --> 06:30.975
I try to keep up
my share,

Dad, I don't think
this is about money, okay?

06:34.345 --> 06:36.213
She asked me to work
with Cisco.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.547
And I hate to say it,

06:37.615 --> 06:38.815
but I think
she was kinda happy

06:38.883 --> 06:40.550
that you stayed
in the barn.

06:40.618 --> 06:41.885
What?

She drove all the way
from California, okay?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.792
I couldn't just
turn her away.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.193
Well, you could've.
You still can.

How am I involved?

figure out what it is.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.187
Why me?

09:06.255 --> 09:08.189
I mean, why did you come
all the way up here?

09:12.060 --> 09:13.194
Who knows,

09:13.262 --> 09:15.396
maybe you're exactly
what Cisco needs.

09:15.463 --> 09:16.630
Just promise me that

09:16.698 --> 09:18.165
this isn't about you

09:21.469 --> 09:23.136
Honestly,
we've barely spoken

09:23.204 --> 09:25.605

09:25.672 --> 09:27.473
Yeah.
Sorry about that.

09:27.541 --> 09:28.608
I guess it was a pretty big
a commitment

09:32.013 --> 09:34.381
Amy, I don't know
what your dad told you,

but we didn't break up over
any "commitment issues."

09:45.825 --> 09:47.492

So, Ty, vet school.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.228
Pretty great,

Amy:
What's she talking about?

09:51.264 --> 09:53.032
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Um, just...
</i> <i>I made the wait list</i>

09:53.099 --> 09:55.300
for the school
in Saskatchewan, so...

09:55.367 --> 09:56.935
Wow.

09:57.002 --> 09:58.836
<i>Georgie:</i> <i>We saw him at
Maggie's</i> <i>with Cassandra.</i>

09:58.904 --> 10:00.071
<i>He even paid</i>
<i>for our lunch.</i>

10:00.139 --> 10:02.273
One of the best vet schools
in the country!

10:02.341 --> 10:04.742
Well, congratulations.
That's... that's awesome.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.876
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Yeah, well done!</i>

10:05.945 --> 10:06.978
Come on, guys.

10:07.046 --> 10:08.346
It's a little early
to celebrate.

10:08.414 --> 10:10.548
Being on the wait list
doesn't mean I got in.

10:10.615 --> 10:12.582
It actually means
that I didn't get in.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.051
Mallory:
Well, according to Cassandra,

10:14.118 --> 10:15.319
it means he has to wait
for someone

10:15.386 --> 10:16.320
that has better grades
then him

10:16.387 --> 10:18.221
to decide not to be a vet,

10:18.289 --> 10:19.756
or wait till they die.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.058
<i>Whichever comes first.</i>

10:21.125 --> 10:22.792
(Screen door bangs shut)
Tim: Hey!

10:22.860 --> 10:24.261
Sorry I'm late.

10:24.329 --> 10:26.296
How can someone be late
when they're not invited?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.297
<i>Tim: (Laughs)</i>
<i>Good one, Jack.</i>

10:29.933 --> 10:30.866
What is that?

10:30.934 --> 10:32.068
Pot roast.

10:32.135 --> 10:33.535
Jack made it.

10:33.603 --> 10:34.770
Tim:
Mmm.

10:34.838 --> 10:36.538
<i>I'll have some anyway.</i>

10:36.606 --> 10:38.574
So... Jack, where's Lisa?

10:40.643 --> 10:42.078
Well, she's got
a busy schedule.

10:42.145 --> 10:43.678
Yeah? Who doesn't?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.615
Amy, how'd it go
with Janice today?

10:47.683 --> 10:48.616
Mmm...

10:48.684 --> 10:50.718
Janice?
Your Janice?

10:50.786 --> 10:51.786
Not any more, Jack.

10:51.854 --> 10:54.022
Dodged that bullet,
remember?

10:54.991 --> 10:56.624
(Mouth full)
Gravy?

Here, poochie!

11:09.471 --> 11:11.238
Got something for ya!

11:14.242 --> 11:15.274
Pot roast.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.979
Hey...

11:20.914 --> 11:22.315
Hey, girl.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.985
Good dog.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.187
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Georgie!</i>

11:28.255 --> 11:29.989
Go! Scoot! Get!

11:37.096 --> 11:38.430
What're you doing
out here?

11:38.498 --> 11:39.831
Um... well...

11:40.633 --> 11:43.301
I can't eat pot roast
'cause I'm a vegan...

11:43.369 --> 11:45.904
And I didn't wanna hurt
Jack's feelings,

11:45.971 --> 11:47.338
so I'm gonna throw it
in the bin.

11:47.406 --> 11:48.572
If you're such a vegan,

11:48.640 --> 11:50.541
why take meat
in the first place?

11:50.608 --> 11:52.476
Um... momentary relapse?

11:58.883 --> 12:01.885
Tim: I'm telling you, she's
gonna show up here eventually.

12:01.953 --> 12:04.054
Amy: You know what?
He seriously believes it, too.

12:04.121 --> 12:05.655
<i>He even bet me</i>
<i>five bucks.</i>

12:05.722 --> 12:07.157
I don't know why

12:07.224 --> 12:08.791
you can't wrap your head around
the simple fact

12:08.859 --> 12:10.993
that maybe Janice
actually wants Amy

12:11.062 --> 12:12.162
to work with Cisco?

12:12.229 --> 12:14.230
I'll tell you why,
Jack.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.731
Money.

12:15.799 --> 12:18.501
I owe her money
for the upkeep of the horse.

12:18.569 --> 12:20.202
A word to the unwise,

12:21.137 --> 12:22.438
your money issues
with Janice

12:22.505 --> 12:23.805
are not your daughter's
problem,

12:23.873 --> 12:24.839
they're your problem.

12:24.907 --> 12:26.108
I know that.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.376
That's why
I don't want Amy involved.

12:27.444 --> 12:29.311
She's already involved, Tim,

12:29.379 --> 12:31.780
so you better make
damn sure...

12:34.217 --> 12:36.551
That she doesn't get caught
in the crossfire.

12:36.618 --> 12:37.552
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>I hear you.</i>

12:37.619 --> 12:38.953
I'm all over it.

12:41.557 --> 12:43.624
(Birds chirp and twitter)

12:46.195 --> 12:47.228
Ty:
Okay...

12:48.897 --> 12:49.997
Amy:
Okay what?

12:50.899 --> 12:52.265
Ty:
I know what's bugging you.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.334
It's the vet school thing.

12:54.402 --> 12:55.402
You're jealous
'cause I told Cassandra

12:55.470 --> 12:57.370
before I told you.

12:57.438 --> 12:58.805
Amy:
(Sighs)

12:59.407 --> 13:01.575
It's just that I helped you
fill out your application,

13:01.642 --> 13:04.811
you know, and...
And write your letter.

13:04.878 --> 13:06.779
I just felt like
it's something between us,

13:06.847 --> 13:08.514
that we shared.

13:08.582 --> 13:10.082
Amy,

13:10.150 --> 13:11.484
Cassandra just happened to be

13:11.551 --> 13:13.119
the first person I saw
when I opened it.

13:14.087 --> 13:16.021
(Chuckles)

13:16.089 --> 13:17.356
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.328
By the way,
has anyone ever told you

13:23.395 --> 13:25.196
you're kinda cute
when you're jealous.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.531
(Chuckles)

13:26.599 --> 13:28.233
'Cause I like it;
Makes me feel special.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.269
Oh! Don't let it go to your head...
(Laughs)

13:35.541 --> 13:36.574
(Knocking)

13:38.210 --> 13:41.278
(Rain patters,
people chatter nearby)

13:45.049 --> 13:46.183
(Sighs)

13:47.385 --> 13:48.552
Well, I should've known
you'd show up

13:48.620 --> 13:50.086
sooner or later.

13:50.155 --> 13:51.955
Yeah, well,
I heard you were here.

13:52.023 --> 13:54.891
Sorry I missed you
earlier.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.659
Let me cut
to the chase, Tim.

13:56.726 --> 13:58.528
I didn't come here
to see you, so...

13:58.595 --> 13:59.529
You didn't miss
a thing.

13:59.596 --> 14:00.530
Oh, hey!

14:00.597 --> 14:02.231
Aw, come on,
Janice.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.135
Don't be like that.
I know what this is about.

14:09.806 --> 14:11.073
I just gotta juggle
a couple things around,

14:11.141 --> 14:13.542
so don't cash it
for a week or so.

14:13.609 --> 14:15.810
I don't want your money, Tim.

14:15.878 --> 14:17.045
Come on,
I owe you the money.

14:17.112 --> 14:18.446
That's... that's what
this is about.

14:18.514 --> 14:20.682
It's the deal.
I owe it to you.

14:20.749 --> 14:22.551
You just don't get it,
do you?

14:22.618 --> 14:24.619
What? Wait!
We're still talking.

14:24.687 --> 14:25.820
<i>Janice:</i>
<i>You wanna talk?</i>

14:25.888 --> 14:27.021
Then don't come
prowling around here

14:27.089 --> 14:28.689
like some randy old tomcat.

14:28.756 --> 14:32.893
Janice, you know I have nothing
but respect for you.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.061
Really?

14:34.128 --> 14:35.462
Then why don't you
show it?

14:35.530 --> 14:36.730
Why don't you ask me
to go for coffee or for lunch

14:36.798 --> 14:37.998
or something,

14:38.066 --> 14:39.766
and maybe
I'll think about it.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.068
Now if you'll excuse me,

14:41.135 --> 14:43.936
I had a really long day,
so... good night.

14:46.106 --> 14:48.441
Do you wanna go out for lunch
or coffee or something?

14:50.010 --> 14:51.311
(Sighs heavily)

14:56.313 --> 14:57.446
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>First up, the barn.</i>

14:57.514 --> 14:58.681
I'm gonna be taking care
of Katie,

14:58.748 --> 15:00.183
so I need you to turn out
the horses,

15:00.250 --> 15:01.450
muck out the stalls,
and fill the water buckets.

15:01.518 --> 15:03.018
Why do I have to do
everything?

15:03.086 --> 15:04.186
Who made you boss?

15:04.253 --> 15:06.054
Jack did,
didn't you, Jack?

15:06.121 --> 15:07.589
Maybe I should
take care of Katie

15:07.657 --> 15:09.491
and you should go do
the work in the barn.

15:09.559 --> 15:11.459
You think taking care
of Katie isn't work?

15:11.527 --> 15:13.995
Because a million mothers
would disagree with you.

15:14.063 --> 15:16.097
Yeah, and you're not
one of them.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.965
(Jack sighs disapprovingly)

15:18.033 --> 15:20.501
I'm sorry
I'm being testy...

15:20.569 --> 15:22.469
What does that mean?

15:22.537 --> 15:23.637
It means for the next
little while,

15:23.705 --> 15:24.871
while I'm busy with Katie,

15:24.939 --> 15:26.240
you're gonna have
to pick up the slack.

15:26.308 --> 15:27.741
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Yeah, busy.</i>

15:27.809 --> 15:30.977
Well, you know what?
I'm feeling a little testy too.

15:33.548 --> 15:36.416
Well, that went well,
didn't it?

15:38.485 --> 15:40.853
Mallory, what're you doing
with that thing?

15:40.921 --> 15:43.189
Someone turned off
your gay paree pictures.

15:43.257 --> 15:44.290
Mallory...

15:45.459 --> 15:46.492
Right.

15:48.061 --> 15:49.995
(Katie gurgles and coos)

15:54.367 --> 15:56.134
<i>Georgie:</i> <i>Hey, poochie!
</i> <i>Got something for ya!</i>

15:58.204 --> 15:59.338
Toast! Bacon!

16:02.108 --> 16:04.142
All right,
what are you doing?

16:05.745 --> 16:07.912
Okay, so there's this dog,
and she comes around here,

16:07.980 --> 16:09.680
so I've been feeding her.

16:09.748 --> 16:11.349
Here, girl!

16:11.416 --> 16:13.117
You're feeding
someone else's dog?

16:13.184 --> 16:14.852
No! She doesn't belong
to anybody.

16:14.919 --> 16:16.587
She's lost.

16:16.655 --> 16:17.855
And she's not here
this morning,

16:17.922 --> 16:20.224
so maybe she's hurt,
or caught in a trap.

16:20.292 --> 16:21.692
Or she went home.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.926
You can't just leave food
lying around out here,

16:22.994 --> 16:24.461
you're gonna attract
scavengers -

16:24.528 --> 16:27.230
mice, raccoons,
even bears.

16:27.298 --> 16:29.031
Are you gonna
rat me out to Jack?

16:29.099 --> 16:30.667
No, but you owe me.

16:30.735 --> 16:31.868
So you better
get with the program

16:31.935 --> 16:33.169
and start sucking up.

16:33.237 --> 16:35.138
I mean now!

16:35.205 --> 16:36.239
Okay!

16:37.642 --> 16:39.709
(Calls out)
Here, girl!

16:39.777 --> 16:42.378
(Hooves thud evenly,
Cisco grunts)

16:42.445 --> 16:43.746
<i>Amy:</i> <i>He's got a
nice</i> <i>forward gait.</i>

16:43.813 --> 16:45.814
I don't think
he's lame at all.

16:45.882 --> 16:48.183
Janice: Yeah, I don't think
soundness is the problem.

16:48.251 --> 16:50.152
Amy:
He seems really responsive.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.454
Well, he knows how
to focus on the job.

16:52.522 --> 16:53.722
You know, Janice,

16:53.790 --> 16:55.991
I really don't see
a problem at all.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.325
Maybe you should breeze him
around the track again,

16:57.393 --> 16:59.394
I can see
if I've missed something?

16:59.461 --> 17:01.896
(Cell phone chirps)
Janice: Yeah, okay.

17:01.963 --> 17:03.264
It's gonna have to be
a bit later though.

17:03.332 --> 17:04.898
I gotta take off
for awhile.

17:04.965 --> 17:06.166
We just got started.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.502
Yeah, I know,
I'm so sorry.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.270
This won't take long though,
I promise.

17:09.338 --> 17:10.471
I'll see you
in a bit.

17:10.539 --> 17:11.539
Amy:
Okay.

17:12.674 --> 17:14.473
(Cisco grunts)

17:14.541 --> 17:15.575
Whoa... whoa...

17:18.378 --> 17:21.047
There's nothing wrong with you,
is there, boy? Hmm?

17:21.115 --> 17:22.281
Nothing at all.

17:23.217 --> 17:25.952
So why aren't you
winning races?

17:31.224 --> 17:32.458
Mallory:
What are you doing

17:32.526 --> 17:33.826
and where do you think
you're going?

17:33.893 --> 17:35.494
I gotta go look
for that dog.

17:35.562 --> 17:36.796
Mallory: You haven't even
mucked out the stalls yet!

17:36.863 --> 17:38.364
I'll do it later.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.532
What is the big deal
with this dog

17:39.599 --> 17:41.033
and why is it
so important to you?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.335
She came here
looking for help,

17:42.402 --> 17:43.636
so I fed her.

17:43.704 --> 17:45.403
I can't just give up
on her now.

17:45.471 --> 17:46.871
Mallory:
Georgie, no!

17:46.939 --> 17:48.873
You're not allowed to go
riding off by yourself.

17:48.941 --> 17:50.475
(Yelling) I promised Jack
I'd look out for you

17:50.543 --> 17:51.710
and I can't blow it.

17:51.777 --> 17:53.177
I'm on a trial run!

17:53.245 --> 17:54.412
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>So what?!</i>

17:54.480 --> 17:56.280
I've been on a trial run
my whole life!

17:56.349 --> 17:58.717
I'll tell Jack,
and he'll call Clint Riley,

17:58.784 --> 18:00.318
and you'll be packed up
out of here so fast

18:00.385 --> 18:02.453
your head will spin!

18:02.520 --> 18:04.355
(Exhales sharply)

18:04.422 --> 18:06.790
If I get fired,
I'm blaming you!

18:12.697 --> 18:14.565
Amy:
Good boy.

18:14.632 --> 18:16.566
Let's get you some brushes.

18:39.188 --> 18:39.888
Ty, hey.

18:41.190 --> 18:42.190
Are you busy?

18:43.893 --> 18:45.226
Perfect. Can you meet me
down at the track?

18:45.294 --> 18:47.562
I need your help
with something.

18:47.630 --> 18:50.030
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Hey, Georgie, wait up!</i>

18:50.098 --> 18:52.032
You better not
keep going!

18:52.100 --> 18:55.068
She's around here somewhere,
I can feel it!

18:55.136 --> 18:56.904
You haven't found her
and you probably won't.

18:56.971 --> 18:58.038
She could be miles
from here,

18:58.106 --> 18:59.339
and we need to go back

18:59.408 --> 19:01.375
before Jack realizes
we're gone.

19:01.443 --> 19:02.643
<i>(Dog barks in the distance)</i>

19:02.711 --> 19:03.844
Did you hear that?

19:04.812 --> 19:05.945

19:06.013 --> 19:07.046

19:08.382 --> 19:10.917
Mallory:
(Sighs) Oh... damn!

19:10.984 --> 19:11.984
(Dog barks)

19:16.390 --> 19:17.490
Janice.

19:19.894 --> 19:21.160
I'm glad
you could make it.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.796
Yeah, well,
it's a small town, Tim.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.198
Can't keep avoiding you
forever.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.467
You're looking good.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.303
You hungry?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.770
Try the vegetarian chili.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.039
I hear it's the best
in Alberta.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.773
I don't want
vegetarian chili, Tim.

19:34.841 --> 19:35.975
Coffee's fine.

19:36.043 --> 19:37.208
I have to get back
to the track.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.010
Yeah. Work always
came first with you;

19:39.078 --> 19:40.812
I respected that.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.914
You know, we were...

19:42.982 --> 19:48.153
We were two different people
on two different paths.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.321
I probably could've handled
the break up

19:49.388 --> 19:50.355
a little better-

19:50.423 --> 19:51.589
You know what, Tim?

19:51.657 --> 19:52.457
I'm actually
not really interested

19:52.524 --> 19:53.857
in talking
about the past.

19:53.925 --> 19:55.292
I'm not talking
about the past,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.328
I'm talking
about the present,

19:57.395 --> 19:59.529
and how, sometimes,

20:00.995 --> 20:02.529
it's hard to move on.

20:02.567 --> 20:05.902
You do not wanna talk to me
about moving on.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.172
You made it all too easy
for me to move on.

20:09.706 --> 20:11.275
Really.

20:13.006 --> 20:15.075
So what do you want?

20:16.146 --> 20:18.481
You still think
this is about you?

20:18.548 --> 20:20.383
You're unbelievable!

20:20.451 --> 20:21.684
For all I knew,

20:21.751 --> 20:23.886
you were still up
in medicine hat

20:23.954 --> 20:25.387
or wherever it was
you used to sneak off to.

20:25.455 --> 20:26.821
Moose Jaw!

20:28.924 --> 20:32.527
I didn't sneak off.
I visited my son.

20:33.762 --> 20:35.263
And his mother.

20:35.331 --> 20:38.566
Yeah, his mother.
You mean, Miranda?

20:41.003 --> 20:43.104
What, where are you
going with this?

20:43.171 --> 20:45.139
Oh my God.

20:45.207 --> 20:46.573
You're back together
with her, aren't you?

20:46.641 --> 20:47.674
No!

20:48.776 --> 20:51.678
I mean...
Yes, I see her...

20:51.746 --> 20:52.980
Occasionally.

20:53.048 --> 20:55.182
She's the mother.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.917
I can't see him
and not the mother.

20:57.985 --> 21:00.820
You know what, Tim?
I have...

21:00.888 --> 21:03.356
Don't even bother
trying to explain.

21:03.424 --> 21:05.791
I saw this one coming
a mile away.

21:07.895 --> 21:10.296
(Low hum of chatter,
music plays quietly)

21:13.166 --> 21:15.167
(Birds chirp, dog barks)

21:22.808 --> 21:23.808
(Dog barks)

21:26.279 --> 21:28.447
I can hear her,
but I can't see her anywhere!

21:29.814 --> 21:32.550
It sounds like
it's coming from over here.

21:32.617 --> 21:34.152
(Wood crumbles)
Whoa!

21:34.219 --> 21:35.353
Are you okay?

21:36.621 --> 21:37.655
(Dog barks)

21:38.857 --> 21:41.325
That's her!
She's down here!

21:41.393 --> 21:45.562
Look, this is a well.
It's dangerous, trust me.

21:45.629 --> 21:46.930
(Dialing beeps)

21:46.997 --> 21:48.565
- What're you doing?
- Calling Jack.

21:48.632 --> 21:50.600
Jack? No way!
Are you crazy?

21:50.668 --> 21:51.968
Why not?

21:52.036 --> 21:53.736
Because it'll be like
every other place I've been!

21:53.804 --> 21:55.172
You find a lost dog
or a cat,

21:55.239 --> 21:56.606
and guess what they do?

21:56.674 --> 21:58.641
They take it
to the farm -

21:58.709 --> 22:00.477
the goodbye poochie farm!

22:00.545 --> 22:01.910
Jack's not like that.

22:01.978 --> 22:03.579
Who says?

22:03.646 --> 22:05.414
You're gonna wreck it
for both of us;

22:05.482 --> 22:08.451
He'll fire you,
and he'll call Clint Riley.

22:08.518 --> 22:09.785
We need help,

22:09.852 --> 22:11.420
so that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

22:11.488 --> 22:12.754
Mallory: We need help!
Georgie: But I'm not!

22:12.822 --> 22:14.423
Hey! Give it!
Georgie!

22:14.491 --> 22:15.491
Georgie:
No!

22:16.493 --> 22:17.959
(Phone clatters)

22:18.026 --> 22:19.160

Oops.

22:23.899 --> 22:25.600
Mallory:
Look what you did!

22:25.667 --> 22:26.601
Georgie: Looks like someone's
gonna have to go down there

22:26.668 --> 22:28.536
and get your phone.

22:28.604 --> 22:31.772
Might as well get the dog
at the same time.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.873
(Dog barks)

22:39.686 --> 22:42.387
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Are you sure you don't want me</i>
<i>to go down there?</i>

22:42.455 --> 22:43.821
Georgie:
She's my dog.

22:43.889 --> 22:45.923
This was my idea.

22:45.991 --> 22:48.559
I'll be okay...
Just don't drop me.

22:48.627 --> 22:49.860
Mallory:
I wouldn't.

22:49.928 --> 22:51.195
I need my phone back,

22:51.262 --> 22:53.064
and if I killed you,
Jack would kill me.

22:53.131 --> 22:54.164
Very funny.

23:05.943 --> 23:07.244
Okay.
Let's go.

23:20.890 --> 23:22.891
Hey, is everything okay?

23:24.428 --> 23:25.595

23:37.940 --> 23:39.207
Hey! Keep it steady!

23:40.176 --> 23:41.843

Georgie,
are you okay?

24:06.767 --> 24:08.868
Georgie: Yeah, but the dog
doesn't look so good.

24:08.935 --> 24:10.603
So we gotta hurry.

24:10.671 --> 24:12.272
I need something to wrap
around her.

<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Why?</i>

24:14.375 --> 24:17.377

</i> <i>How else can we get her up?</i>

24:21.914 --> 24:24.816
Hey... we're gonna get you
outta here,

24:25.751 --> 24:27.486
I promise.

24:27.554 --> 24:28.587
It's okay.

24:35.127 --> 24:36.661
All right,
what am I doing here?

24:36.728 --> 24:38.396
Okay,
take a look at this.

24:38.463 --> 24:39.430
What am I looking at?

24:39.498 --> 24:40.964
Amy:
All right,

24:41.032 --> 24:41.965
so jockeys keep records
of all their times, right -

24:42.033 --> 24:43.834
their wins, their losses -

24:43.902 --> 24:45.736
and this is Janice's book
on Cisco.

24:45.804 --> 24:47.405
<i>So look at this:</i>

24:47.472 --> 24:49.240
<i>These are his races this year,</i>
<i>these are the tracks,</i>

24:49.308 --> 24:50.441
and those are times.

24:50.509 --> 24:51.909
Ty:
Okay.

24:52.843 --> 24:54.744
One minute sixteen seconds
at Delmar;

24:54.812 --> 24:56.313
One twelve at Los Alamitos;

24:56.380 --> 24:57.581
One seventeen, Fairplex -

24:57.648 --> 24:58.682
that seems pretty consistent.

24:58.749 --> 25:00.149
Yeah, consistent -

25:00.218 --> 25:03.052
consistently worse
than last year.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.054
Isn't that why she's here, Amy?

25:05.122 --> 25:06.756
Amy:
(Sighs) Well, yeah...

25:06.824 --> 25:08.124
But even when
I timed her yesterday,

25:08.192 --> 25:09.625
she was way slower
than she's been before.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.027
Okay...

25:12.095 --> 25:13.696
But without the adrenaline
from a real race, Amy,

25:13.763 --> 25:15.698
you gotta expect him
to be a bit slower.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.367
Well... yeah,
but I don't think that's it.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.569
You know, Janice brought Cisco
here for me to look at

25:20.637 --> 25:23.305
and I don't think
she's giving it all she's got.

25:23.373 --> 25:24.240
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa.</i>

25:24.307 --> 25:25.406

Hello, Jack.

30:11.675 --> 30:13.943
Jack:
Don't you "hello Jack" me.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.545
Where are you?

30:15.613 --> 30:18.482
Don't worry,
everything is fine.

30:18.549 --> 30:20.949
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>What're you saying?
</i> <i>Everything is not fine!</i>

30:21.018 --> 30:24.387
Well, that's interesting,
'cause guess what I'm doing?

30:24.454 --> 30:26.588
I'm staring at two
saddled horses in my yard

30:26.656 --> 30:28.357
and you're not on
either one of them,

30:28.425 --> 30:31.427
so start talking
and don't you dare lie to me.

30:31.495 --> 30:32.961
Georgie:
Okay.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.531
Promise you won't get mad?

30:35.598 --> 30:37.532
Ty:
Sixty-nine point two.

30:37.599 --> 30:39.767
That was from a standing start.

30:39.835 --> 30:41.503
Janice:
Not bad.

30:41.570 --> 30:42.537
I'm gonna go
get the truck.

30:42.604 --> 30:44.172
Amy:
Okay.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.907
You know and I both know
there's a million variables.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.675
I mean, different day,
different track,

30:47.743 --> 30:48.976
different jockeys.

30:49.045 --> 30:52.013
Yeah, but I'm not even close
to a real jockey

30:52.080 --> 30:54.648
and still got a better time
than you did.

30:54.715 --> 30:57.584
Yeah. So maybe whatever
was slowing him down

30:57.652 --> 30:59.453
is just starting to heal
on its own.

30:59.521 --> 31:01.588
I'm not sure about that.

31:01.656 --> 31:04.758
I think one of those variables
is how much you both wanna win.

31:04.825 --> 31:08.561
I mean, I know Cisco does;
I'm not so sure about you.

31:08.628 --> 31:10.663
(Laughs) What're you
talking about, Amy?

31:10.730 --> 31:13.266
I wanna win so bad,
I drove all the way up here.

31:13.333 --> 31:17.170
I just mean that maybe
there's some issues

31:17.237 --> 31:19.439
from when you and my dad
broke up.

31:19.506 --> 31:21.541
You know what, Amy?
I do have issues.

31:21.608 --> 31:23.109
I have issues
with the kind of man

31:23.177 --> 31:25.377
who would ask me to marry him
just to get custody of his kid.

31:28.047 --> 31:30.882
I'm sorry.
I... I had no idea.

31:32.485 --> 31:35.120
It's okay, you don't have
anything to apologize for.

31:35.188 --> 31:37.722
But you're right;
You have no idea.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.692
Look, coming up here was
obviously a big mistake,

31:41.759 --> 31:43.660
so I'll pay you for the work
you've done.

31:43.728 --> 31:46.630
But I don't want counselling
or helpful suggestions

31:46.698 --> 31:49.333
from you
or anyone else.

31:49.401 --> 31:51.502
You know, I think you do
want something,

31:51.570 --> 31:54.638
but not from me.
(Cell phone rings)

31:55.574 --> 31:58.174
That fact that Cisco still
belongs to my dad

31:58.242 --> 32:00.076
is one of the reasons you're
sitting back in your saddle

32:00.144 --> 32:01.277
when you ride.

32:01.345 --> 32:02.278
Just answer your phone, Amy.

32:02.346 --> 32:04.080
We're done here.

32:05.015 --> 32:06.514
 (Phone beeps)

32:06.715 --> 32:08.150
Amy: Hello?

32:10.721 --> 32:13.489
A well? Again?
Are you kidding me?

32:15.425 --> 32:17.593
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
We'll be right there.

32:17.660 --> 32:18.660
Bye.

32:19.662 --> 32:22.231
So what if you're right?

32:23.166 --> 32:26.735
What if it isn't the horse
and it is me?

32:28.070 --> 32:30.804
How are you gonna
fix that?

32:36.971 --> 32:39.740
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Okay, we're gonna get you</i>
<i>in a couple minutes now.</i>

32:39.807 --> 32:41.407
Ty:
What do we got here, Jack?

32:41.475 --> 32:43.643
Jack: We're just
bringing the dog up now.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.544
Is Georgie okay?

32:45.612 --> 32:48.280
Mallory: She says she's
okay, but the dog is hurt.

32:48.348 --> 32:50.415
Jack:
Yeah, there she is.

32:50.483 --> 32:51.516
(Dog whimpers)

32:52.485 --> 32:53.485
Amy:
It's okay...

32:53.553 --> 32:54.987
Jack:
Hold her there.

32:55.922 --> 32:58.224
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Yoo-hoo! Can you hear me?!</i>

32:58.291 --> 32:59.358
Hey, guys?!

33:00.627 --> 33:01.659
Don't you guys dare
let her run away!

33:01.727 --> 33:03.594
Do you hear me?

33:03.662 --> 33:06.831
(Quietly) Maybe we should
just leave her down there.

33:06.899 --> 33:08.299
Don't worry,

33:08.367 --> 33:10.534
I don't think that dog's
gonna be running anywhere.

33:10.602 --> 33:12.503
Okay, send her back down,
Mallory.

33:12.571 --> 33:13.704
(Winch whirs)

33:16.441 --> 33:17.540
(Jack grunts)

33:19.343 --> 33:21.745
<i>You all set down there?</i>

33:21.813 --> 33:23.013
Yeah. I guess.

33:28.253 --> 33:29.519
Jack: Keep her going,
keep her going.

33:29.587 --> 33:31.121
(Winch whirs)

33:31.189 --> 33:33.222
Georgie:
Where is she?!

33:33.290 --> 33:35.224
Jack:
Amy and Ty have her.

33:35.292 --> 33:36.425
Well, what're they doing
with her?

33:36.493 --> 33:37.660
Where are they going?

33:37.727 --> 33:39.796
They're taking her
to Scott's clinic.

33:39.863 --> 33:41.497
Well, I wanna go
with them!

33:41.564 --> 33:43.299
Guys! Wait for me!

33:43.366 --> 33:45.268
<i>(Truck rumbles away)</i>
<i>I wanna come with you!</i>

33:45.335 --> 33:46.535
Guys!

33:47.504 --> 33:49.370
It's not fair!
She's my dog!

33:49.438 --> 33:50.705
I found her.

33:50.773 --> 33:52.307
Told you we should've
left her in there.

33:52.374 --> 33:53.909
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Yeah, maybe we should have.</i>

33:56.612 --> 33:59.948
<i>Now what the heck</i>
<i>am I gonna do with you?</i>

34:00.016 --> 34:01.817
Did you call Clint Riley?

34:01.884 --> 34:04.252
Do you want me too?

34:04.320 --> 34:05.553
No.

34:05.621 --> 34:07.855
Then why are you asking?

34:07.923 --> 34:11.492
Well, I thought 'cause,
you know... me here,

34:11.560 --> 34:13.393
and this is a trial run.

34:13.462 --> 34:14.795
Well, I suppose it is
a trial run,

34:14.862 --> 34:17.231
but not just for you -
for all of us.

34:17.299 --> 34:18.599
Georgie:
Yeah, but I'm the only one

34:18.667 --> 34:20.601
that's gonna get sent off
to a crappy foster home.

34:20.668 --> 34:22.969
Nobody's gonna get
sent anywhere.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.138
But it would help

34:25.206 --> 34:26.105
if you didn't go looking
for trouble

34:26.172 --> 34:27.139
all the time.

34:27.208 --> 34:28.141
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Sorry!</i>

34:28.208 --> 34:29.775
I promise.
Next time.

34:29.844 --> 34:32.212
Jack: Next time? No next time.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.991
Hey!
Hey, I'm glad you called.

34:46.059 --> 34:47.460
We kinda got off
on the wrong foot.

34:47.527 --> 34:49.094
What is Cisco doing here?

34:49.161 --> 34:51.129
I thought he was supposed to be
at the track with Amy.

34:51.197 --> 34:52.931
Yeah, she's already taken
a look at him,

34:52.998 --> 34:54.998
and she thinks
he's in great shape.

34:55.067 --> 34:57.168
There's just
one little problem:

34:57.236 --> 34:59.070
He needs to start
winning races,

34:59.137 --> 35:01.639
and that's not gonna happen
while I'm riding him.

35:01.707 --> 35:02.974
Well, don't say that.

35:03.041 --> 35:04.208
Come on,
you're a good jockey.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.343
You had a solid season.

35:05.411 --> 35:07.545
A solid season -
last year.

35:07.613 --> 35:10.313
But now, every time
I get on this horse,

35:10.382 --> 35:11.749
from the start gate,

35:11.816 --> 35:13.417
waiting for that bell
to go off,

35:13.485 --> 35:15.318
and rounding the turn,
then heading for home,

35:15.387 --> 35:16.887
I keep thinking...

35:17.822 --> 35:21.057
Man, this is a great horse...
But he's Tim's horse.

35:21.125 --> 35:23.326
Come on,
hey, I'm outta this.

35:23.395 --> 35:26.462
I've taken a step back.
I won't interfere.

35:27.898 --> 35:29.499
If you're serious
about forgiving that debt,

35:29.566 --> 35:32.568
I won't even pay you back
the money I owe you.

35:32.636 --> 35:35.438
Wow, that's really generous, Tim,

35:35.506 --> 35:38.841
but you're right,
I don't want your money.

35:38.909 --> 35:42.411
I just wanna give
this horse to you.

35:42.478 --> 35:43.412
You can't do that.

35:43.479 --> 35:44.479
This isn't easy for me, Tim,

35:44.547 --> 35:47.215
but I don't have a choice.

35:47.283 --> 35:50.918
Look, I just...
I want a normal life.

35:50.985 --> 35:53.521
You know, I wanna meet a guy,
fall in love,

35:54.456 --> 35:57.558
you know, maybe get married,
have a family...

35:59.127 --> 36:00.294
I don't think
any of that's possible

36:00.361 --> 36:02.496
while you're still
in the picture.

36:02.564 --> 36:03.630
So...

36:10.638 --> 36:12.505
This is goodbye.

36:15.743 --> 36:17.944
Yeah.
I guess it is.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.383
(Cisco snorts)

36:35.361 --> 36:36.260
Cassandra:
Hey, Amy, nice to see you.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.762
Amy:
Yeah, you too.

36:37.830 --> 36:38.496
Cassandra: I called Scott.
He's on his way.

36:38.564 --> 36:39.630
Ty:
Okay.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.165
Amy:
Um, where do you want her?

36:41.232 --> 36:42.533
Cassandra: Uh, let's just
get her up on the table.

36:42.601 --> 36:43.835
Ty: Careful.
She's sore on the right side.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.336
Probably got some
bruised ribs.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.071
Yeah, I think her hip
might be dislocated as well.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.072
Cassandra: Scott said to
give her some pre-meds

36:48.139 --> 36:49.239
if she's in pain.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.708
Ty:
Okay.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.308
Amy, you need to uh...
Move right outta there.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.477
Amy: Okay, I'm sorry.
Ty: Thank you.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.878
Uh, hydro?
Three mils?

36:54.946 --> 36:55.712
Cassandra: Uh yeah,
sounds about right.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.813
Ty:
Okay.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.383
I need in here.
Sorry.

37:00.451 --> 37:01.518
Amy: Oh, you know what?
I'm just in the way.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.218
You guys seem to have it
under control.

37:02.286 --> 37:03.353
I'm gonna go.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.454
Okay, I'll call you later, okay?

37:04.522 --> 37:06.089
Amy:
Okay.

37:06.156 --> 37:07.156
<i>Ty:</i> <i>I think we're gonna need</i>
<i>some X-rays.</i>

37:07.224 --> 37:07.957
Yeah,
and some blood work too.

37:08.024 --> 37:09.892
Okay, I'm on it.

37:11.995 --> 37:14.296
Okay...
How are her vitals doing?

37:14.364 --> 37:15.330
<i>Cassandra: Okay.</i>
<i>Ty: Yeah?</i>

37:15.398 --> 37:16.665
<i>Cassandra:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:16.733 --> 37:18.000
<i>Ty: Here it goes.</i>
<i>Cassandra: You're good.</i>

37:18.067 --> 37:20.503
<i>Just take a little blood,</i>
<i>that's good.</i>

37:27.815 --> 37:29.315
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

37:30.015 --> 37:31.315
<i>You win;</i>

37:31.418 --> 37:32.952
It wasn't really
about the horse.

37:33.020 --> 37:34.820
Tim: No, no. You...
You keep that.

37:34.888 --> 37:37.490
I don't feel like
much of a winner...

37:38.425 --> 37:40.693
And now I got a horse
that can't run.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.996
I wouldn't say
he can't run.

37:43.063 --> 37:45.663
<i>He did six furlongs</i>
<i>in just over a minute;</i>

37:45.731 --> 37:47.832
That's enough to put him in
the winner's circle every time.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.235
Yeah? That'd make a lot
of owners happy.

37:52.105 --> 37:54.406
So why aren't I happy, Amy?

37:55.541 --> 37:59.277
I don't know,
maybe because you used Janice?

38:00.178 --> 38:01.745
<i>I can't believe you asked her</i>
<i>to marry you</i>

38:01.813 --> 38:03.414
<i>just so you could win</i>
<i>the custody case!</i>

38:03.482 --> 38:05.582
Nah, it wasn't like that!

38:08.387 --> 38:10.321
Okay. Okay,
maybe it was like that.

38:13.225 --> 38:14.591
But I just wanted my son...

38:14.659 --> 38:16.393
Yeah, I know.
I've heard it all before.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.428
To have a father!

38:20.597 --> 38:23.466
And now, every time
I see that damn horse...

38:27.138 --> 38:28.538
<i>You're right;</i>

38:29.473 --> 38:32.974
I-I-I can't... believe how badly
I treated Janice.

38:33.443 --> 38:35.077
I can't believe it.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.615
So what're you gonna do
about it?

38:40.683 --> 38:41.983
At this point, I don't know
if there's anything

38:42.052 --> 38:43.919
I can do about it.

38:45.021 --> 38:46.422
I think there is.

38:54.229 --> 38:55.996
Mallory:
Okay. I know I blew it.

38:56.065 --> 38:58.399
I tried to stop Georgie,
but she just went ahead anyway.

38:58.467 --> 38:59.500
And I didn't call you

38:59.568 --> 39:00.668
because I didn't want you
to think

39:00.735 --> 39:02.670
that I couldn't handle her
by myself.

39:02.737 --> 39:06.005
The way I figure it,
Georgie's the type that...

39:06.074 --> 39:07.507
She's gonna do
what she's gonna do,

39:07.575 --> 39:08.908
no matter
what you tell her.

39:08.976 --> 39:10.777
My thoughts exactly!

39:10.844 --> 39:14.581
And we all make mistakes,
don't we?

39:14.648 --> 39:16.249
Maybe you made more
than your fair share.

39:16.317 --> 39:17.517
What do you think?

39:17.585 --> 39:19.453
Come on, Jack.
It all turned out okay in the end.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.587
Yeah, it did.

39:21.654 --> 39:25.424
And I know you'll do
better next time.

39:25.492 --> 39:27.025
What're you saying?

39:27.094 --> 39:30.662
Are you telling me
that I got the job?

39:30.730 --> 39:33.566
There was never any doubt
in my mind about that.

39:33.633 --> 39:35.734
Me too!
I mean, honestly,

39:35.802 --> 39:37.635
I just have this natural gift
with kids.

39:37.703 --> 39:39.937
It's like they're just
immediately drawn towards me.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.872
Don't push it.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.541
Okay.

39:43.609 --> 39:45.810
Well, anyway,
thanks, Jack.

39:45.877 --> 39:49.080
You're not such a bad guy
after all.

39:49.148 --> 39:52.549
Or maybe you're just getting
soft with old age.

39:54.319 --> 39:55.885
(Sternly)
I am not!

39:56.854 --> 39:57.954
(Door closes)

40:08.365 --> 40:09.698
(Dialing beeps)

40:14.338 --> 40:16.572
Jack:
Hello, Lisa Stillman.

40:27.116 --> 40:29.217
(Rain patters,
low hum of chatter nearby)

40:29.285 --> 40:32.053
Tim,
what're you doing here?

40:32.121 --> 40:34.389
I'm giving you
the horse.

40:34.457 --> 40:35.890
You know I can't be a jockey
and an owner

40:35.958 --> 40:36.858
at the same time.

40:36.925 --> 40:38.960
I've talked to my lawyer.

40:39.028 --> 40:41.562
I got the original
bill of sale,

40:41.630 --> 40:44.131
the pedigree papers,
the jockey club registration...

40:44.199 --> 40:45.432
You can start fresh;

40:45.500 --> 40:46.733
You can find yourself
a new partner,

40:46.801 --> 40:48.202
keep racing Cisco.
Or you can sell him,

40:48.270 --> 40:51.071
whatever you want,
no strings attached.

40:51.139 --> 40:53.807
You know
it's not that easy.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.277
I screwed everything up,
I know that.

40:58.646 --> 41:01.715
I wish I could... change it,
but I can't.

41:06.154 --> 41:09.022
I loved you,
I really did, you know?

41:12.726 --> 41:15.494
Come on,
it wasn't all bad.

41:17.130 --> 41:19.699
Yeah, I guess that's what
makes this so difficult.

41:19.766 --> 41:21.033
Well, it is for me too;

41:21.101 --> 41:23.635
That's why we gotta do this -
we gotta...

41:23.704 --> 41:26.072
We gotta make a clean break.

41:27.207 --> 41:29.808
And you own the horse
a hundred percent,

41:29.875 --> 41:31.475
nothing to do with me.

41:32.444 --> 41:33.477
(Sniffles)

41:34.780 --> 41:37.082
And never let our past
hold you back.

41:40.485 --> 41:41.485
I didn't really feel
that good

41:41.553 --> 41:44.322
about giving him to you,
anyway.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.665
Thank you, Tim.
Really.

41:59.236 --> 42:00.636
Thank you.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.812
(Sighs)

42:14.851 --> 42:15.717
<i>Amy:</i> <i>(Laughing)</i>
<i>What're you doing?</i>

42:15.785 --> 42:17.385
Ty:
Just come with me.

42:17.453 --> 42:19.788
Amy:
But why are we up here?

42:20.656 --> 42:23.491
Because everything good
that's ever happened in my life

42:23.559 --> 42:26.093
started when I was in
this room.

42:27.695 --> 42:30.898
University of Calgary,
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.332
It came this morning,

42:32.400 --> 42:34.334
and I got a good feeling
about this one.

42:34.402 --> 42:37.304
So I want to share it
with the woman I love.

42:37.372 --> 42:38.405
O-kay.

42:39.707 --> 42:40.774
(Paper tears)

42:46.147 --> 42:48.047
- You ready?
- Yeah.

42:48.115 --> 42:50.517
♪ Let every sunrise
show you how ♪

42:54.555 --> 42:55.922
Congratulations, Ty,
you did it!

42:55.990 --> 42:57.590
Ty:
Yes! (Laughing)

42:59.559 --> 43:01.059
Amy:
I knew! I knew you'd get it!

43:01.127 --> 43:02.662
Ty:
Oh my God!

43:02.729 --> 43:04.664
<i>Amy: Ty, you even got</i> <i>a scholarship!
</i> <i>Ty: Yes!</i>

43:04.731 --> 43:06.332
- What's going on?
- Let's go see.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.434
Mallory:
Mm, no, forget it.

43:08.502 --> 43:10.670
Why?
What's the big problem now?

43:10.737 --> 43:12.904
There's no big problem.
It just sounds like...

43:13.005 --> 43:15.139
Ty and Amy got some
good news.

43:15.207 --> 43:16.974
Yeah, so?

43:17.042 --> 43:18.310
So maybe we should go back
to the house

43:18.377 --> 43:20.679
and let them celebrate
in peace.

43:20.746 --> 43:22.013
Maybe they were celebrating,

43:22.080 --> 43:23.782
but it sure doesn't
sound like it now.

43:23.849 --> 43:25.817
Mallory: Believe me,
they're celebrating.
