WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:03.389
- Beckbie, what's going on?
- Madison and True,

00:03.390 --> 00:05.879
their foster family came to pick
them up from after school care

00:05.880 --> 00:07.539
- and they were gone.
- When Kodie needs to think,

00:07.540 --> 00:09.839
she goes to the land.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.969
What do I do, turn myself in?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.179
- Keep running.
- As your boss,

00:13.180 --> 00:14.919
I am furious that you discredited me

00:14.920 --> 00:17.517
to our client and gave her
illegal and unethical advice.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.144
My friends and I want to start
a search for those kids.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.604
This is an official police matter.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.273
You could go to jail for years.

00:23.274 --> 00:24.607
You'd rather protect a junkie

00:24.608 --> 00:26.943
who kidnaps her own
kids than do your job?

00:26.944 --> 00:29.612
Someone's trying to make
sure I lose my kids forever.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.657
Hey, you can pretend to be
a police chief all you want,

00:31.658 --> 00:33.701
but we know what kind
of chief you really are.

00:35.980 --> 00:37.529
She's still facing parental abduction.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.706
She could get a 10-year sentence.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.831
She takes a plea.

00:39.832 --> 00:43.001
Or she turns herself in,
hands over the kids

00:43.002 --> 00:45.169
and you charge her with
violating a custody order.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.399
We will be seeking a 10-year sentence.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.589
When kids are apprehended,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.279
they're not allowed to
bring any of their stuff.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.551
It's tantamount to theft.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.639
You have to let me see them, please!

00:53.640 --> 00:55.499
Get your hands off of me!

00:55.500 --> 00:58.460
If they're wrong about Kodie,
they're wrong about all of them.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.339
True? True, baby,

01:32.340 --> 01:33.479
- are you OK?
- Mom, what's happening?

01:33.480 --> 01:35.261
Let me talk to my kids!

01:41.602 --> 01:43.686
I'll be put in a family, she told me!

01:43.687 --> 01:46.398
No!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.700
Oh, hey,

01:57.701 --> 02:00.703
- coffee's ready.
- Be down in a second.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.690
- You OK?
- Yeah, of course.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.459
The court hereby releases
Mushkode Chartrand

02:08.460 --> 02:10.598
under the strict conditions
of house arrest.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.759
If you attempt to leave your abode,
the alarm on your ankle monitor

02:13.760 --> 02:15.079
will alert law enforcement.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.759
If you consume alcohol
or any illegal substances,

02:17.760 --> 02:19.931
the alarm will sound. If you make

02:19.932 --> 02:21.719
any attempt to contact your children,

02:21.720 --> 02:23.360
your bail will be revoked.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.680
Thank you.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.164
Are you not feeling eggs?

02:44.170 --> 02:47.099
- No, I am.
- I can make you something else.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.254
- Do we have any oranges?
- I don't think so.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.810
You're worried about Kodie.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.959
I promised to get her kids back, but...

03:02.960 --> 03:04.359
how are we supposed to argue

03:04.360 --> 03:06.379
that someone who stole her children

03:06.380 --> 03:07.979
should have full custody?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.620
Yeah.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.609
All those kids...

03:13.610 --> 03:15.559
Kodie's case may be unique,

03:15.560 --> 03:17.689
but she's not the only one.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.779
How many other families
have lost their kids

03:19.780 --> 03:22.829
because of the lack of due process?

03:22.830 --> 03:25.747
Well, if these are anything to go by...

03:25.748 --> 03:29.789
Whoever they are, we need to find them.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.359
You know,

03:31.360 --> 03:33.859
we all want the same thing...

03:33.860 --> 03:36.047
to ensure the Chartrand children
are safe and supported.

03:36.048 --> 03:37.699
Then I'm sure you won't
mind providing us

03:37.700 --> 03:38.719
with apprehension orders.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.637
From the past six months, please.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.320
Lawyers...

03:42.330 --> 03:44.739
Straight to the rebuttal before coffee.

03:44.740 --> 03:46.392
- Can I get you a cup?
- No, thank you.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.719
It's terrible anyway.
Look, we don't release

03:48.720 --> 03:51.231
apprehension orders.
It's a breach of privacy.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.349
Well, we have a right
to access any files

03:53.350 --> 03:54.902
that are connected to our client's case.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.399
You have your client's file.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.439
We believe that our client's
a victim of a larger pattern

03:58.440 --> 04:00.319
of wrongful apprehensions.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.339
Oh. It's a nice story.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.379
But your client wasn't even on our radar

04:05.380 --> 04:07.372
'til a neighbour reported
her for neglect.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.320
Which he was teed up to do

04:09.330 --> 04:11.209
by someone posing as Family Services.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.833
Well, we had nothing to do with that.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.879
Well then, you should be
as determined as we are

04:14.880 --> 04:16.339
to reunite Kodie with her family.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.257
Except that your client is an addict.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.699
Or have you forgotten she failed
a court-ordered drug test

04:21.700 --> 04:23.179
and then kidnapped her own children?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.959
Let's not make this
harder than we have to.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.059
I'm sure you're familiar with
an Access to Information Order.

04:42.270 --> 04:44.139
Morning, Mayor Shepard.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.489
Sam Mercer says he has
dash cam footage of you

04:46.490 --> 04:47.912
assaulting him.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.994
He's calling it "excessive force."

04:49.995 --> 04:51.250
Have you seen the video?

04:52.820 --> 04:54.080
You have to apologize.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.539
What?! No way. It was justified.

04:57.540 --> 05:00.460
Maybe... but I can't
have my chief of police

05:00.470 --> 05:01.801
decking civilians.

05:01.802 --> 05:06.055
If Mercer releases that video,
it'll prove he's lying.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.640
So he threw the first punch?

05:07.641 --> 05:08.949
There were no punches.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.329
You didn't put your hands on him?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.219
I was protecting a Millwood family

05:15.220 --> 05:16.899
from racist vigilantes.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.160
The public won't see it that way.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.799
Just apologize to him, Owen.
You don't have to mean it.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.283
I do it all the time.
It's called marriage.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.910
I won't grovel to a bigot.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.019
You make me fix this myself,

05:32.020 --> 05:33.541
you won't like the outcome.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.209
Welcome to Millwood Family
Services. Nothing to see here.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.959
They did say there might
be some redactions.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.640
Yeah, this is state secrets level.

05:45.650 --> 05:48.079
If this is correct,
Millwood Family Services

05:48.080 --> 05:50.764
is apprehending children at
twice the national average.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.269
It can't be right, can it?

05:57.700 --> 05:58.809
Luna.

05:58.810 --> 06:02.039
Hi. Uh, I'm on my way in to the office.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.280
Just wanted to check that
you still wanted me?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.654
You called at the perfect time.
I have a job for you.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.699
- Great.
- We have files

06:08.700 --> 06:10.020
from each of the children abducted

06:10.030 --> 06:11.784
by Millwood Family Services.

06:11.785 --> 06:13.620
Our working theory is
that there's a pattern

06:13.630 --> 06:14.791
of wrongful apprehensions.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.123
We need to go through every case

06:16.124 --> 06:18.479
- and find similarities.
- Sounds easy enough.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.214
Well, all the personal information
in the files has been redacted.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.479
O... K, sounding less easy.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.676
So, we need you and Cat
to come up with a way

06:25.677 --> 06:27.971
to decode the files and figure
out who these families are.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.509
How bad is it?

06:29.510 --> 06:31.975
They were pretty thorough
at scrubbing the names.

06:31.976 --> 06:33.119
Hmm...

06:33.120 --> 06:34.839
Any dates on the apprehension orders?

06:34.840 --> 06:36.479
Yes to dates. What are you thinking?

06:36.480 --> 06:39.190
We could cross-reference
apprehension dates

06:39.191 --> 06:40.929
with police duty reports.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.640
When police attend an apprehension,

06:42.650 --> 06:44.028
they'd have to record the address.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.739
That's great. Grab Cat

06:46.740 --> 06:48.579
and head over to Millwood.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.909
Stop by the police department

06:49.910 --> 06:51.239
on your way to grab reports.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.247
Wait. You want me to go to
the Millwood Police Station?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.279
It was your idea.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.877
Talk to Beckbie. He'll take care of you.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.380
Thanks.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.059
This town is the size
of a postage stamp;

07:06.060 --> 07:08.427
redacted files can't stop us
from finding these families.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.388
I heard the pastor started fostering.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.513
The guy that compared me to the Devil?

07:12.514 --> 07:14.239
Yeah. Not our biggest fan,

07:14.240 --> 07:17.719
but it's hard to argue against
the well-being of children.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.730
I don't know, he might be persuaded
to make an introduction.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.901
Only if you're objectively as
charming as I think you are.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.119
Hey, are you sure it was
a good idea asking Luna

07:27.120 --> 07:29.279
- to come here?
- We need her.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.040
And she's gonna have to make her peace

07:31.050 --> 07:32.560
with this town sooner or later.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.519
I have to admit,

07:35.520 --> 07:36.779
I didn't expect to see you again

07:36.780 --> 07:38.207
without a subpoena in your hand.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.379
Haha! No, it's nothing like that.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.619
I promise. We just...

07:42.620 --> 07:44.699
- needed some guidance.
- Hmm.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.419
How long have you been fostering for?

07:46.420 --> 07:48.080
Since Amanda left for college.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.739
My wife couldn't stand the silence.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.053
But we had no idea...

07:52.054 --> 07:53.557
What you were signing up for?

07:53.558 --> 07:55.320
What we were promising.

07:55.330 --> 07:58.959
You know, I thought a safe,
loving home, I can do that.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.260
I had no idea how small an offer that is

08:01.270 --> 08:03.107
in the face of what these
kids are going through.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.942
You mean being separated
from their families?

08:04.943 --> 08:07.739
They come to us with trauma.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.156
They act out in self-destructive ways.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.073
How much contact is there
with birth parents?

08:12.074 --> 08:14.899
Very little. Family Services
shuttles them back and forth

08:14.900 --> 08:16.599
for visitation, if they have it.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.664
It's emotional for everyone.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.719
We're working on an investigation

08:20.720 --> 08:23.480
into the number of child
apprehensions in Millwood.

08:23.490 --> 08:25.459
Are there any similarities
between the families

08:25.460 --> 08:27.423
that alerts the attention
of Family Services?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.499
Aside from the obvious demographics,

08:29.500 --> 08:30.924
a lot of the parents are addicts,

08:30.925 --> 08:32.970
but that's never the full story.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.759
It's often reported through the schools.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.578
Is there anyone you'd be
able to connect us to

08:36.580 --> 08:37.601
who lost their kids?

08:37.602 --> 08:38.679
I'm afraid not.

08:40.059 --> 08:41.809
I don't think they'd
want to hear from me.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.769
A lot of the people see me
as enabling a broken system.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.359
Why do you keep fostering?

08:50.360 --> 08:52.657
Because a lot of these
foster homes aren't safe,

08:52.658 --> 08:55.259
and these kids need somewhere to go.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.339
But once they're in the system...

08:57.340 --> 08:58.789
it's never a happy ending.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.150
Well, thank you, Pastor.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.049
Maybe Luna and Cat
will have better luck.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.839
I'll call around, see if
there's any birth parents

09:13.840 --> 09:15.739
- willing to talk to us.
- And I'll check with Diane.

09:15.740 --> 09:17.089
If there'd been an
increase in apprehensions,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.350
she'll know about it.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.759
You're awfully quiet for
a road-trip partner.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.739
Have you ever been happy?
Like, truly happy?

09:32.740 --> 09:35.139
Wow, OK. Uh, usually people start off

09:35.140 --> 09:38.739
with "Nice weather we're having," but...

09:38.740 --> 09:41.919
a long time ago, yeah.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.040
You?

09:43.041 --> 09:46.109
I don't know. I thought
I was for a minute,

09:46.110 --> 09:48.509
- and then...
- It just turns on a dime?

09:48.510 --> 09:50.160
Millwood was my home

09:50.170 --> 09:52.424
and then suddenly,
it was my worst nightmare.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.427
Wait, have you not been back since...

09:55.428 --> 09:57.264
I was locked up for
something I didn't do?

09:57.265 --> 09:58.879
I didn't know the rules

09:58.880 --> 10:00.349
about bringing that up. I'm sorry.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.019
Fair. The whole thing
messes with your head.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.439
So this is Millwood.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.468
- I can't.
- You can't what?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.929
I can't do this.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.339
OK.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.932
Do you wanna tell me why?

10:41.933 --> 10:44.039
Because the last time I was here,

10:44.040 --> 10:45.437
I thought my life was over.

10:46.660 --> 10:49.599
Well... turns out it wasn't.

10:52.060 --> 10:54.460
Everybody's gonna look
at me differently now.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.009
Hey... who cares?

10:57.010 --> 11:00.579
Seriously, Luna, let people
think whatever they want.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.912
The only thing that matters
is how you see yourself.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.849
I'm one of the lucky ones.

11:05.850 --> 11:08.619
Because of Joanna, I got my life back.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.399
Right.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.139
So it's time to pay that forward.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.599
Kodie has been screwed

11:14.600 --> 11:16.675
by the system, Luna, just like you were.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.511
Let's show her that she's not alone.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.669
Come on!

11:21.670 --> 11:23.869
It's time for a reclamation tour.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.219
"A reclamation tour"?

11:25.220 --> 11:27.843
You walk straight into the
places that hurt you the most

11:27.844 --> 11:29.799
and reclaim them as new memories,

11:29.800 --> 11:31.106
starting with the cop shop.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.800
I like that.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.739
But I think I need to face the
police station on my own.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.146
Luna?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.829
That's not information we release.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.359
I already have the apprehension orders

12:30.360 --> 12:31.543
from Family Services.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.449
My officers go out on call,

12:36.450 --> 12:38.559
they need to know that
I won't sell them out.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.717
I have to back them up.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.589
Hey.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.300
I won't let anything
happen to you in here.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.059
I'm never gonna feel safe in Millwood.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.019
No one in Millwood comes
through that door

12:53.020 --> 12:55.108
without my say so.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.859
Ahem.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.659
I'm not on a witch hunt.
I just need the addresses

13:08.660 --> 13:11.041
they visited so I can contact
the affected families.

13:11.042 --> 13:13.039
When I give you our DPRs,

13:13.040 --> 13:15.059
it'll look like I'm taking a side.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.629
I'm under a lot of scrutiny,
I have to keep my hands clean.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.219
You always say sunlight
is the best antiseptic.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.593
Unless... your guys
are hiding something.

13:22.594 --> 13:26.138
Using my own values against me...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.899
Or you can continue to
cover for an organization

13:28.900 --> 13:31.603
that facilitates and legitimizes
breaking up families.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.640
Now you're just like your mother.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.739
She never gives up.

13:38.740 --> 13:41.779
But... the answer's still no.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.359
I can file an Access
to Information Order.

13:46.850 --> 13:49.745
Now you're just like your sister.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.449
I will have your special

13:52.450 --> 13:54.259
and coffee and whatever my friend wants.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.519
- Oh, just a coffee, thanks.
- Yeah, certainly.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.239
You're gonna make me eat alone?

14:00.120 --> 14:02.884
Do you have any oranges?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.179
No, those are for the signature sangria.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.940
- You don't want to eat those.
- Never mind.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.840
- You look tired.
- No, I'm fine.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.269
OK, just feeling a little
under the weather.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.059
Exhaustion like I've never felt.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.499
- Nauseous?
- Yeah.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.490
Vomiting? And weird cravings

14:26.491 --> 14:29.618
for things like oranges?
I don't wanna freak you out,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.453
but the last time I felt
that way, I was pregnant.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.332
I took a pregnancy test
and it was negative.

14:36.450 --> 14:40.004
I think this case is taking more
emotional stamina than I thought.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.841
Yeah. Cases with kids are the worst.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.469
Uh, tell me about the process
of child apprehensions.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.949
Does Family Services take
the kids from school?

14:50.950 --> 14:51.959
Thank you.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.519
Um, yeah. So sometimes,

14:54.520 --> 14:56.099
parents drop their kids off at school

14:56.100 --> 14:58.314
and have no idea that they
won't be coming home again.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.849
Based on what, tips?

14:59.850 --> 15:03.119
From teachers? You?

15:03.120 --> 15:06.389
Teachers have a duty to report
or they lose their licenses.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.419
It doesn't happen so much at my school

15:08.420 --> 15:09.799
because of the catchment.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.919
If the mayor's kid
shows up with bruises,

15:11.920 --> 15:13.119
she gets the benefit of the doubt.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.179
We call, we ask if
everything's OK at home.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.245
But at other schools?

15:16.246 --> 15:18.779
Schools on the East Side,

15:18.780 --> 15:23.173
they... tend to tip first
and ask questions later.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.593
Who would be the worst offender?

15:28.050 --> 15:29.629
Legacy Pines.

15:29.630 --> 15:32.220
They've got a lot of kids
in foster care right now.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.440
So this is where children
turn into foster kids.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.281
The principal will know who's
tipping off Family Services,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.409
whether it's one teacher
or a policy thing.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.390
Let's find out.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.669
May I help you?

16:06.670 --> 16:09.399
Oh, uh, hi. Diane Evans,
principal over at...

16:09.400 --> 16:13.079
- Millwood High.
- Your reputation precedes you.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.182
We're wondering if we can have
a minute with your principal.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.264
He's very busy. Can you
tell me what it's about?

16:17.265 --> 16:19.939
Yeah, we wanna speak to him
about your school's relationship

16:19.940 --> 16:20.979
with Family Services.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.857
Our headmaster is available
by appointment only.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.979
Look, um...

16:25.980 --> 16:28.339
I know how tricky it is.

16:28.340 --> 16:30.399
When one of our students
is having trouble at home,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.408
it always feels like a
lose-lose situation.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.699
Anything you say

16:34.700 --> 16:36.829
can be kept confidential
from Family Services.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.379
Millwood Family Services
is one of our allies.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.879
They provide partial funding
for our B and A programs.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.759
Before and after school programs.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.499
And who takes care of the rest?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.279
The school is on the
hook for the balance,

16:48.280 --> 16:50.089
but the headmaster makes it work.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.639
He sounds like a stand-up guy.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.014
You sure he can't make time
to discuss student safety?

16:55.015 --> 16:57.779
Safety is our primary concern,

16:57.780 --> 16:59.919
which is why we don't
entertain strangers

16:59.920 --> 17:01.437
who just walk in off the street.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.840
I'm not a stranger.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.638
I'm a lawyer investigating your school

17:04.640 --> 17:06.398
because of its high child
apprehension rate.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.429
So unless you want to
be named in my claim,

17:09.430 --> 17:11.195
I suggest he find the time.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.241
I'll see what I can do.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.679
Family services is an ally?

17:20.680 --> 17:22.079
So it's a policy,

17:22.079 --> 17:24.019
not just a bad egg.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.079
We need to talk to that headmaster.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.129
OK, so this is what you've been calling

17:37.130 --> 17:39.183
- the Millwood Branch?
- Hahaha! Yup.

17:45.140 --> 17:48.039
- It's a lot of wood.
- Oh, yeah.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.879
There's a lot more on the inside.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.339
What?

17:52.340 --> 17:55.199
So we match the dates to
reports, get the address

17:55.200 --> 17:56.992
and then search for the
identity of the tenants.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.159
It's a smart idea.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.419
I have a few tricks up my
sleeve when I really need them.

18:02.420 --> 18:05.160
All these kids taken away.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.044
I can't imagine growing
up without my mom.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.380
She was my hero.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.459
Cat... I'm sorry.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.719
It's OK. I'm young,

18:14.720 --> 18:17.263
you assume my mom's still
alive, it's what people do.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.350
You never really talk about her.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.229
Death freaks people out.
I end up comforting them.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.355
It's just easier not to.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.231
What about your dad?

18:28.232 --> 18:31.349
You mean do we talk about her?

18:31.350 --> 18:34.799
Not really. I think we're
both kind of afraid

18:34.800 --> 18:36.739
to remind each other that she's gone.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.284
You must miss her.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
So much it hurts.

18:43.410 --> 18:44.791
Nice weather we're having.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.659
Look at this!

18:51.660 --> 18:53.899
This apprehension order from last month.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.929
Same date, a police visit
to 512, River Road.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.849
There's a warrant on this woman

18:58.850 --> 19:01.089
for parental neglect,
but no apprehension.

19:01.090 --> 19:03.980
They didn't apprehend the kid?

19:06.060 --> 19:08.060
This is where Morgan lives.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.273
I come here every afternoon
to see him get off the bus.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.219
He comes around that corner
and goes right to that house.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.480
A week ago, he stopped.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.071
Does anyone else know you do this?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.489
I had to know he was OK.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.575
Dylan. Dylan! Listen to me.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.909
Listen! You can't be coming here, OK?

19:22.910 --> 19:23.995
That's stalking.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.994
Family Services keeps
changing the rules on me!

19:25.995 --> 19:27.123
Changing the rules how?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.619
I drive two hours to parenting classes,

19:29.620 --> 19:31.289
I never miss one, and then they say

19:31.290 --> 19:32.760
I was supposed to be going with Morgan.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.579
But I lost visitation
because he doesn't know

19:34.580 --> 19:35.591
who I am anymore!

19:35.592 --> 19:36.801
What are they saying now?

19:36.802 --> 19:38.799
His caseworker stopped
returning my calls,

19:38.800 --> 19:39.970
and then Morgan disappeared.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.097
Maybe the family just moved.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.267
That's his foster dad's
truck in the driveway.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.469
Please, you have to find him.

19:48.860 --> 19:51.314
I can't. I have my hands
full with this case.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.275
Well, something terrible has happened.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.695
- I just know it.
- I'm sure there's an explanation.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.919
Family Services won't talk to me,

19:57.920 --> 19:59.190
but they might tell you.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.199
Alright, I'll look into it.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.538
Just promise me you'll
stay away from that house.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.208
Hey. Promise.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.189
Mr. Reyes?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.500
Mr. Reyes.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.859
- Excuse me, Mr. Reyes?
- Go away.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.920
- I just want to talk.
- Get off my deck.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.099
I'm here about your
foster son, Morgan Hayes.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.339
Is there some reason he stopped
taking the school bus?

20:57.340 --> 21:01.399
You from Family Services?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.669
'Cause Morgan's not here, OK?
And if you don't leave,

21:03.670 --> 21:05.799
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- Just tell me where he is.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.279
Do you know how long
I spent teaching that kid

21:08.280 --> 21:09.819
that he was safe here?

21:09.820 --> 21:11.220
And then you guys had to go

21:11.229 --> 21:13.103
and blow everything up again.

21:13.104 --> 21:14.919
What are you talking about?
What happened?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.318
Someone should have warned
me that he had been adopted.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.979
Instead, you just came in

21:19.980 --> 21:23.073
- and took him.
- He's been adopted?

21:23.074 --> 21:26.659
I have a right to know.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.770
He's my son.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.129
- What do you want?
- I'm Catherine Carmichael.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.079
This is my associate, Luna Spence.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.094
Luna Spence?! Holy crap!

21:44.095 --> 21:46.379
Oh, my gosh! Callie!

21:46.380 --> 21:48.979
We went to high school together.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.268
Wow, so small town.

21:51.269 --> 21:54.896
Our law firm is investigating
misconduct by Family Services.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.982
We have a friend whose
children were apprehended.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.901
We think you could help make
a difference in our case.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.699
I don't want any trouble.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.760
Family Services has got lawyers too.

22:02.770 --> 22:04.949
Your conversation with us
would be confidential.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.659
We know Family Services opened a case

22:06.660 --> 22:08.719
against your baby, Carter.
We just need to know

22:08.720 --> 22:10.579
how you convinced them not
to take him into custody.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.164
I think you've got it all wrong.

22:14.060 --> 22:17.120
This is baby Carter.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.990
What is taking so long?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.459
I mean, why stonewall us if
you have nothing to hide?

22:23.460 --> 22:26.359
What she said about
Family Service funding,

22:26.360 --> 22:29.279
is it possible that they're
tipping off Family Services

22:29.280 --> 22:31.600
in order to gain access
to government funds?

22:31.601 --> 22:34.978
Uh... there's a lot of ways to
double dip with foster kids.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.938
Pre-K engagements,

22:36.939 --> 22:38.982
special needs, extracurricular camps.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.109
- True?
- What?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.979
I thought I saw True Chartrand.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.196
True!

22:45.430 --> 22:47.157
What are you doing?!

22:47.158 --> 22:51.069
I, uh... I thought I
recognized a student.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.899
Our headmaster is unavailable.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.791
You'll have to make an
appointment for another time.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.499
This school has the highest
child apprehension rate

22:58.500 --> 23:01.004
in Millwood, and he
can't even talk to us?

23:01.005 --> 23:02.839
I don't appreciate what
you're insinuating.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.540
I'm not insinuating
anything, I'm asking.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.634
Your school survives off children
in the system, yes or no?

23:08.635 --> 23:10.199
Hey, we have to have pupils.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.682
Family Services survives
off apprehending children.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.619
You would starve without clients.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.940
Wait, are you saying that
Millwood Family Services...

23:17.950 --> 23:21.239
is financially incentivized
to break up families?

23:21.240 --> 23:23.679
Their funding is dependent
on apprehension.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.919
That is a blatant conflict of interest.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.919
Take it up with a judge.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.326
Everything we do here is by the book.

23:42.570 --> 23:44.499
- Mayor Shepard!
- Ms. Chang.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.659
- What can I do for you?
- Is Family Services funded

23:46.660 --> 23:49.177
- per child apprehended?
- Technically,

23:49.178 --> 23:51.385
apprehension is how
funding is triggered.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.359
But that means the
entire budget, payroll,

23:53.360 --> 23:56.179
everything is dependent on
children being taken away.

23:56.180 --> 23:58.049
But it also means there's
enough money in the pot

23:58.050 --> 23:59.062
to care for every kid.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.564
How much of that goes to
prevention or reunification?

24:01.565 --> 24:04.859
- That's their priority.
- How much of a priority?

24:04.860 --> 24:07.195
I can pull their budgets if I have to.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.189
10%.

24:09.190 --> 24:12.200
Seems to me like prevention
is an afterthought

24:12.201 --> 24:14.499
compared to how much is
going into foster care.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.460
- Am I on trial here, Ms. Chang?
- Not yet.

24:16.470 --> 24:18.639
I had no say in how their
funds were earmarked.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.659
Then who does?

24:19.660 --> 24:21.420
Provincial government,
way above my paygrade.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.279
Family Services got paid

24:24.280 --> 24:26.379
when my client's children were taken;

24:26.380 --> 24:27.883
you don't think those
things are related?

24:27.884 --> 24:30.239
Would you risk leaving a
child in an unsafe home

24:30.240 --> 24:32.399
- and hoping for the best?
- No, of course not.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.723
But they're breaking families
apart and no one's accountable.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.840
Family Services hasn't broken the law.

24:37.850 --> 24:39.989
Your client, on the other hand, has.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.981
You need someone to blame?
Try Kodie Chartrand.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.359
Family Services showed
up here about a week ago

24:48.360 --> 24:50.989
insisting that they had to do
a house check for the baby.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.449
What were they looking for?

24:52.450 --> 24:55.493
They kept asking, but they wouldn't say.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.609
No idea what brought them here?

24:57.610 --> 25:00.206
Honestly, that week is a blur.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.625
I was supposed to start a
job at the school board,

25:02.626 --> 25:04.959
then the offer fell through.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.279
Next thing I know,

25:06.280 --> 25:09.090
Family Services is turning
my house upside-down.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.843
Were you in the system as a kid?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.919
Nothing like that.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.219
Do you have any other history with them?

25:16.220 --> 25:17.516
Any other children apprehended?

25:17.517 --> 25:20.439
Carter is my first.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.729
Honestly...

25:22.730 --> 25:25.419
I've been going over it for weeks.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.099
It doesn't make any sense.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.439
How can there be an
open case for neglect

25:29.440 --> 25:32.579
on a baby that's not even born yet?

25:32.580 --> 25:34.630
We're missing something here.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.788
Back so soon, Mr. Crawford?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.831
I'm giving you everything I can.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.489
I'm here to file an appeal to
stop Morgan Hayes's adoption

25:44.490 --> 25:47.919
on behalf of his mother, Dylan Hayes.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.619
Adoptions are final.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.539
Ms. Hayes had plenty of
chances to get her son back.

25:51.540 --> 25:54.470
Millwood Family Services has
been negotiating in bad faith.

25:56.460 --> 25:57.640
You sure?

25:58.770 --> 26:01.393
I mean, we're not asking
for much, Mr. Crawford

26:01.394 --> 26:03.160
a safe, sober home,

26:03.170 --> 26:06.159
access to public
education, medical care.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.909
The bar is on the floor,

26:07.910 --> 26:09.734
yet Miss Hayes keeps tripping on it.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.849
Alright.

26:11.850 --> 26:14.900
What does she have to do to
prove to you she's ready?

26:34.940 --> 26:37.099
That was Morgan...

26:37.100 --> 26:39.630
after he spilled paint on the carpet.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.119
Nothing Dylan Hayes
says will convince me

26:43.120 --> 26:45.260
to let her near that child again.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.359
I'm sorry for crashing
in on you like this.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.059
Oh, trust me, your visit
could not be better timed.

26:54.060 --> 26:56.698
- Why?
- It's nothing.

26:56.699 --> 27:00.110
It's dinnertime and Owen's MIA.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.419
We're finally at this
beautiful place together

27:04.420 --> 27:08.379
and I'm afraid he's gonna burn
it all down for Sam Mercer.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.460
I did the same thing to Billy.

27:10.470 --> 27:12.239
We had it all in Winnipeg and then I go

27:12.240 --> 27:14.260
- and drag us onto this case.
- That's different.

27:14.270 --> 27:17.039
- You were protecting your friend.
- Some friend I am.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.949
You are the only one in this town

27:18.950 --> 27:21.347
who has even a chance of
stopping Family Services.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.219
No, they are unstoppable!

27:23.220 --> 27:24.760
I can't fix a broken system.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.319
Someone has to do it.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.419
Can I get anything for you?

27:30.420 --> 27:32.519
Are you making coffee?

27:32.520 --> 27:33.899
Inside.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.439
- You can smell that?!
- You can't?

27:36.440 --> 27:38.569
You're sure you're not pregnant?

27:38.570 --> 27:40.639
I told you, I took a test.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.161
I think you should take another one.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.549
Chief Beckbie.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.539
Sam.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.089
May I have a word?

28:02.090 --> 28:05.643
He's calling me by my civilian
name, I must be in big trouble.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.569
I understand you feel
disrespected by my office.

28:14.570 --> 28:16.119
Yup. Ahem.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.279
By your office. By you personally.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.430
Right. Ahem.

28:22.860 --> 28:27.160
Well, maybe we were both
a little overzealous.

28:28.590 --> 28:30.319
Is that the best you can do?

28:33.040 --> 28:36.039
It's OK, Owen.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.439
I'm not in the mood to fight.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.010
I'm here to celebrate. I got a new job.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.199
Our mayor has appointed me

28:44.200 --> 28:46.558
head of the Community
Safety Advisory Committee.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.639
The mayor gave you that job?

28:48.640 --> 28:50.529
Yeah. Well, Alison knows somebody needs

28:50.530 --> 28:52.439
to keep an eye on the police.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.941
You?

28:53.950 --> 28:57.059
You don't think I can handle it?

28:57.060 --> 28:58.699
Make sure none of your officers

28:58.700 --> 29:00.154
get knocked out with a lead pipe?

29:03.790 --> 29:05.519
You were the first on the scene.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.998
Yeah, I guess that blow wasn't
quite hard enough, huh?

29:13.420 --> 29:15.290
Excuse me.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.779
You always keep pregnancy
tests lying around?

29:24.780 --> 29:27.891
I was a guidance counsellor
in Millwood for 10 years.

29:27.892 --> 29:31.040
These and condoms were
the bulk of my business.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.349
- Anything?
- Still no.

29:34.350 --> 29:37.739
It's gonna be negative. I don't
know why we're doing this.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.340
Humour me.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.609
You should tell Owen how you feel.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.199
That's not important right now.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.859
If you don't say anything and
he does something stupid,

29:47.860 --> 29:49.455
it's contributory negligence.

29:51.780 --> 29:54.819
I have tried to talk to him.

29:54.820 --> 29:57.039
Believe me.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.300
It's like I'm not even here.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.139
You ever feel like being with someone

30:02.140 --> 30:03.761
is a game of Russian roulette?

30:05.380 --> 30:08.219
Whatever you're feeling right now is OK.

30:08.220 --> 30:09.891
What?

30:09.892 --> 30:13.309
It's positive. You're pregnant.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.140
I'm freezing.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.179
How did I fail the other pregnancy test?

30:31.180 --> 30:33.239
I have never failed a test in my life.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.559
Don't tell my students this,

30:34.560 --> 30:36.539
but sometimes it's not the
answers that are wrong,

30:36.540 --> 30:37.960
it's the test itself.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.049
Oh, my God!

30:41.050 --> 30:43.039
What is it?

30:43.040 --> 30:46.619
What if... Kodie didn't fail that test?

30:46.620 --> 30:49.400
What if the test itself is broken?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.854
Kodie has insisted on her
sobriety since day one.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.648
Clients lie to us all the time.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.192
And I watched them test Kodie;
I didn't see anything sketchy.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.112
OK, but what if we can prove
that the test itself was wrong?

31:04.113 --> 31:05.447
Can we challenge the evidence?

31:05.448 --> 31:06.739
Yes, exactly.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.119
A false positive, faulty
equipment, cutting corners.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.319
And if the science is wrong,

31:10.320 --> 31:11.379
and Millwood Family Services

31:11.380 --> 31:13.329
used it to apprehend Kodie's kids...

31:13.330 --> 31:16.165
Then we can use that to
overturn the custody ruling.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.627
The pastor said a lot of his
foster kids' parents were addicts.

31:18.628 --> 31:19.920
It all lines up.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.170
Callie.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.511
But how do we prove it?

31:29.560 --> 31:32.939
Kodie's test was administered
by Clear Dawn Labs.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.419
If we can establish a
pattern of false positives,

31:35.420 --> 31:37.103
we can challenge the lab.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.879
OK, thanks. That was Callie Sparrow.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.939
The mom who Millwood
Family Services tagged

31:41.940 --> 31:44.027
for neglect on a baby that
hasn't even been born yet.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.571
She failed the drug test when applying

31:45.572 --> 31:46.959
for a job at the school board.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.448
She says she was clean at the time.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.659
Does she know the name of
the lab that did the test?

31:50.660 --> 31:52.359
It was Clear Dawn Labs.

32:09.050 --> 32:11.939
Kodie?

32:11.940 --> 32:14.090
It's Joanna.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.390
If you want to sink our
case, go ahead, take a sip.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.899
House arrest is hell.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.559
Where did you even get that?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.489
The worst day of my life happened here.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.619
Everyone keeps asking
"What can I do to help,"

32:33.620 --> 32:35.871
as long as they don't have
to actually do anything.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.950
I'm sorry I left you alone today.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.878
It's OK. I'm a grown-up.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.250
Please give me the bottle.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.550
Kodie, this is not gonna
bring your kids back.

32:53.555 --> 32:54.890
I know that.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.629
But I can.

33:01.630 --> 33:05.479
I need you to fail a drug
test for me, one more time.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.985
You think you can do that?

33:11.440 --> 33:13.899
Is it... is it a good home?

33:13.900 --> 33:16.739
Will he have a brother or anything?

33:16.740 --> 33:19.779
I saw the photos from the
night he was taken away,

33:19.780 --> 33:22.319
what you did to him.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.000
They're saying that was me?!

33:24.002 --> 33:25.795
What the hell,

33:25.796 --> 33:28.249
might as well have been.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.132
I'm the one who called Family Services.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.635
You reported on yourself?

33:31.636 --> 33:32.859
No!

33:36.780 --> 33:38.433
On his dad.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.769
I knew I had to get
him out of the house,

33:41.770 --> 33:43.919
but I couldn't do it alone.
And then I tested dirty

33:43.920 --> 33:45.691
and they didn't believe a
thing I said after that.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.149
Why did you hide that from me?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.769
Because...

33:48.770 --> 33:51.613
I trust all the wrong people.
It's what I do.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.589
The lab that processed your test,

33:55.590 --> 33:56.610
do you remember the name?

33:56.618 --> 33:59.529
- Some lab on Laurent Ave.
- Clear Dawn?

33:59.530 --> 34:01.206
Yeah, that's the one.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.759
Excuse me, I am here to see
the chief medical officer

34:08.760 --> 34:09.839
of Clear Dawn Labs.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.929
You found me.

34:10.929 --> 34:13.050
- Dr. Solomon Stone.
- Joanna Chang.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.885
I'm a lawyer for Kodie Chartrand.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.638
These... are...

34:17.639 --> 34:20.739
results from the same sample
from Kodie Chartrand.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.819
And... we did this again

34:22.820 --> 34:24.978
with two other subjects

34:24.980 --> 34:28.690
Callie Sparrow and Dylan Hayes.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.349
All false positives. All from your lab.

34:31.350 --> 34:32.821
How do you explain that?

34:32.822 --> 34:34.978
I don't have to explain
anything, Ms. Chang.

34:34.980 --> 34:35.991
We're not in court.

34:35.992 --> 34:39.978
Kodie Chartrand, she's on a
24-hour ankle monitoring

34:39.980 --> 34:42.460
for drug consumption,
so if she had even,

34:42.469 --> 34:45.081
even a milligram of cocaine,
her alarm would have gone off.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.659
You're comparing the
work of my esteemed lab

34:47.659 --> 34:49.045
with an electronic gadget?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.949
What safeguards do you have in place

34:52.949 --> 34:54.675
to prevent a false positive?

34:54.676 --> 34:58.009
She's clearly tampered with
the monitoring device.

34:58.010 --> 35:01.779
Dr. Stone, you must be aware
we're onto something here.

35:01.780 --> 35:03.999
So how about you sign
an affidavit stating

35:04.000 --> 35:06.659
that one of your lab technicians
mishandled evidence

35:06.660 --> 35:08.357
that resulted in a false positive?

35:08.358 --> 35:10.899
- Based on?
- Facts.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.839
And then, you will do a review

35:12.840 --> 35:15.905
of every single drug test that
has come out of this lab.

35:15.906 --> 35:19.699
Ms. Chang, I have decades of experience

35:19.700 --> 35:22.579
analyzing lab results.
I don't make mistakes,

35:22.580 --> 35:25.599
but I appreciate your concern.

35:25.600 --> 35:29.269
Any more questions can go
through our legal team.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.170
Billy, he lawyered up. We got him.

35:47.210 --> 35:49.481
This is the situation.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.479
We believe that you're being
framed by faulty drug tests

35:55.480 --> 35:57.656
at Clear Dawn Labs, and
you're not the only one.

35:57.657 --> 36:00.099
I knew Family Services was after me.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.269
I told you.

36:01.270 --> 36:02.940
We can sue Clear Dawn Labs

36:02.950 --> 36:05.079
for knowingly providing faulty tests.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.859
Kodie, if we get a guilty verdict,

36:07.860 --> 36:10.415
we can use it to overturn
your custody ruling.

36:10.416 --> 36:12.139
Family Services took my kids

36:12.140 --> 36:13.879
and everyone just went along with it.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.092
I know. I didn't know how to
prove it before, but now I do.

36:17.093 --> 36:19.799
No. No more proof.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.160
I'm blowing the lid off this
thing on the 6 o'clock news.

36:22.170 --> 36:23.199
Kodie, if you do that,

36:23.200 --> 36:25.391
you make it impossible
for me to win this case.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.719
I can't sit here waiting
for you to rescue me.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.102
My kids need to be home.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.529
Kodie, if you go to the press,

36:30.530 --> 36:33.199
it is going to be open season
on your personal life.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.861
Ms. Chartrand, how long
were you hooked on coke?

36:35.862 --> 36:38.999
How long did Ackie abuse
Madison before you noticed?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.698
Where were you the night Ryan overdosed?

36:40.699 --> 36:43.949
The defence will destroy you.

36:43.950 --> 36:47.169
But if we file a civil suit first,

36:47.170 --> 36:49.669
they can't use anything that's
not in our statement of claim.

36:49.670 --> 36:53.709
We control the narrative
and I can protect you.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.669
I know it's been a dark time,

36:58.670 --> 37:02.439
and... nothing moves fast enough

37:02.440 --> 37:04.472
to fix what's happening to your family.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.289
True's turning 8.

37:09.290 --> 37:12.022
And suing the lab, that
won't bring my kids back.

37:12.023 --> 37:14.160
The problem is...

37:14.170 --> 37:17.705
everything that Family
Services has done up until now

37:17.706 --> 37:18.859
has been legal.

37:18.860 --> 37:21.640
Right, so how do I fight
someone who's above the law?

37:21.650 --> 37:24.033
I think you've been trying to tell me.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.479
They system isn't broken,

37:26.480 --> 37:29.059
it's working exactly as it was intended.

37:29.060 --> 37:30.919
So we don't need to fix the system,

37:30.920 --> 37:32.041
we need to break it.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.210
We sue Clear Dawn Labs,

37:34.211 --> 37:36.549
we break a chain in that system.

37:36.550 --> 37:40.341
Then we take the decision back
to family court and we prove

37:40.342 --> 37:43.677
that Family Services stole your kids.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.859
This is my arena, Kodie.

37:45.860 --> 37:48.899
I can see a way through this now.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.519
This is how we win.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.900
Owen?

37:57.901 --> 37:59.939
No. No.

37:59.940 --> 38:01.819
Whatever this is, no!

38:01.820 --> 38:03.600
There's a target on my back.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.479
As long as I'm here,
you're all in danger.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.439
So you're just gonna leave us here?!

38:07.440 --> 38:10.919
Alone, exposed? What is wrong with you?

38:10.920 --> 38:12.760
I just need a few days

38:12.770 --> 38:15.001
to settle this thing with
Mercer once and for all.

38:15.002 --> 38:17.379
He is baiting you,
and you are letting him.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.921
Please let this go.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.569
He's threatening me, my staff.

38:21.570 --> 38:23.939
Yeah, and he threatened the
kids, but nothing happened!

38:23.940 --> 38:26.299
What? When?

38:26.300 --> 38:28.519
A long time ago,

38:28.520 --> 38:30.641
- but it was just talking.
- No.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.059
He attacked me with a pipe.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.919
It's not just talk.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.519
OK, but we got through that.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.619
We got through that together, babe.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.519
How long were you gonna
keep that from me?

38:40.520 --> 38:42.279
Honestly, I was afraid you
were gonna do exactly

38:42.280 --> 38:43.989
what you're planning to do now!

38:45.720 --> 38:47.949
We'll never be safe as
long as he's out there.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.506
He has nothing left to lose, you do!

38:50.507 --> 38:52.705
Please let this go!

39:04.880 --> 39:06.590
No, no.

39:11.250 --> 39:14.139
Fine! Just go!

39:22.569 --> 39:25.659
I guess you're heading
back to Winnipeg then.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.940
Yeah, uh, in the morning.

39:27.950 --> 39:30.529
You have everything you need,
everything you asked for,

39:30.530 --> 39:32.996
- all the police files.
- And then some.

39:34.140 --> 39:37.399
If you hadn't have come,
we wouldn't have met Callie,

39:37.400 --> 39:39.639
it wouldn't have led us to Clear Dawn.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.919
Now we have a case.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.819
If I didn't know any better,

39:42.820 --> 39:45.080
that almost sounded like a compliment.

39:46.700 --> 39:49.240
You did good today, Luna.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.559
Is that my boss or my sister talking?

39:54.560 --> 39:58.240
Stop cross-examining me and
take a compliment already.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.599
You sent me to the
Millwood Police Station

40:02.600 --> 40:06.488
where I was falsely arrested.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.199
You think I was being insensitive?

40:10.200 --> 40:14.287
You think I was only
thinking about the case?

40:16.380 --> 40:18.239
I knew how hard it would be for you

40:18.240 --> 40:20.299
to ever come back here,

40:20.300 --> 40:22.087
that you wouldn't do it without a push.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.340
You are one of the strongest
people I know, Luna.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.710
I knew you could do it.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.840
If I didn't believe in you,
I wouldn't waste my time.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.869
Thanks.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.560
I think.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.148
And now you know you can come home.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.739
So you're saying

40:45.740 --> 40:49.030
you... you did this for
me and not for the case?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.450
A bit of both.

40:56.913 --> 41:01.083
You can head back if you want, but, um,

41:01.084 --> 41:03.319
do you remember what you said to me

41:03.320 --> 41:05.250
when you found out we were sisters?

41:09.520 --> 41:11.520
It was, "Stay."

41:14.220 --> 41:16.390
You asked me to stay.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.560
This part of Millwood
I could get used to.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.059
How was that with Joanna?

41:34.060 --> 41:36.839
Ah... Preferred running from my past.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.129
Yeah. People say
"Time heals all wounds,"

41:39.130 --> 41:40.519
but I think it's just
giving more practice

41:40.520 --> 41:42.199
at stuffing down the pain, you know.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.269
Yeah.

41:43.270 --> 41:45.211
I hate how good I am at it, you know.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.339
Yeah, you had to be.
Your father, this town,

41:48.340 --> 41:50.519
they betrayed you.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.299
But somehow, you still
managed to come out

41:52.300 --> 41:53.928
with all your best parts.

42:10.640 --> 42:11.819
I like you, Luna.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.899
- I like you too.
- Oh, I mean...

42:14.900 --> 42:18.939
I like you and I can't.

42:18.940 --> 42:22.956
- I... I work for your sister.
- She won't care.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.409
Yeah, well, she won't care
until I let you down,

42:25.410 --> 42:28.963
and then she will never forgive me.

42:30.660 --> 42:35.427
So, we're just gonna pretend
this never happened?

42:35.428 --> 42:38.289
No, it happened, it happened.

42:38.290 --> 42:41.684
It... it just can't again.

42:43.490 --> 42:46.481
Stuff... stuff it all away.

42:54.447 --> 42:57.367
Our statement of claim
against Clear Dawn Labs.

42:57.368 --> 42:59.560
Looks good.

42:59.570 --> 43:02.099
You haven't even read it yet.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.990
We both know it's perfect.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.789
I was counting on you to
make it more perfect.

43:07.790 --> 43:09.462
We're partners.

43:28.070 --> 43:30.320
I am never having kids.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.600
I'm pregnant.
