01:44.215 --> 01:46.884
Dylan, we've gotta stop.

01:54.434 --> 01:57.061
Yeah, we gotta stop. I'm dying here.

01:58.354 --> 01:59.856
- Dylan.
- Brenda, we've been going out

01:59.939 --> 02:02.733
for two months now.
I have been absolutely faithful to you,

02:02.817 --> 02:06.404
and all I get is a bunch of promises,
and a lot of "I'm sorry."

02:06.487 --> 02:09.115
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

02:09.615 --> 02:10.907
Be friendly.

02:12.326 --> 02:13.995
I can't tonight.

02:14.704 --> 02:16.747
How about next weekend?

02:17.331 --> 02:20.126
I'm going to Palm Springs
with Kelly and Donna next weekend.

02:20.209 --> 02:21.294
Presidents' Day weekend?

02:21.377 --> 02:23.796
You're gonna spend three days
in Palm Springs with Kelly and Donna?

02:23.879 --> 02:25.881
What's wrong with that?

02:26.465 --> 02:28.592
How about I get us a room?

02:28.676 --> 02:31.137
- Where?
- In Palm Springs.

02:31.429 --> 02:33.723
Kelly and Donna
can drop you off at the hotel,

02:33.806 --> 02:36.308
and you can tell your parents
you're staying with them,

02:36.392 --> 02:39.562
and then we'll have three whole days
to spend together.

02:40.396 --> 02:44.191
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

02:55.869 --> 02:59.373
Honey, I'm a little concerned about
there not being any parents out there.

02:59.456 --> 03:00.958
Mother, that's the point.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.335
All the schools are out
for Presidents' Day.

03:03.419 --> 03:06.296
Kelly says, "Anybody who's anybody
goes to Palm Springs."

03:06.380 --> 03:09.550
It's a ritual.
It's like the geese flying south

03:10.134 --> 03:12.136
or north, or wherever they go.

03:12.636 --> 03:16.098
Well, just make sure we have a number
where we can reach you.

03:16.306 --> 03:19.309
Maybe you should get me
one of those radar collars like for dogs.

03:19.393 --> 03:21.520
No, Bren, what you need
is one of those collars

03:21.603 --> 03:24.690
that electrocutes you
every time you get out of line.

03:27.651 --> 03:30.779
Oh, what I need is a new car.

03:31.071 --> 03:33.865
- Brandon.
- Dad, I know what you're gonna say,

03:33.949 --> 03:38.120
and I don't want you to say anything
until you take a look at this brochure.

03:38.203 --> 03:40.247
See, any good mechanic
can restore an old engine,

03:40.330 --> 03:44.334
but this guy completely restores the
original interiors, the original grillwork.

03:44.418 --> 03:46.586
It costs $25,000!

03:46.962 --> 03:49.339
Well, yeah, but it's a classic.

03:49.673 --> 03:52.175
And it's definitely gonna be worth
more than that in five years.

03:52.259 --> 03:54.344
That's why Dylan's father
bought him a Porsche.

03:54.428 --> 03:57.722
Dylan's father is facing
a grand jury indictment.

03:58.181 --> 04:00.267
I better finish packing.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.604
Come on, Dad.
You know how hard I work.

04:04.688 --> 04:08.191
And last night Nat tells me that I can't
go to Palm Springs this weekend

04:08.275 --> 04:10.443
with all of my friends
because his sister's sick,

04:10.527 --> 04:12.320
and now I have to work all weekend,

04:12.404 --> 04:14.906
but you don't hear me complaining,
do you?

04:14.990 --> 04:16.116
Yes.

04:33.758 --> 04:37.303
Magic Mountain's gonna be so cool
this weekend. It's gonna be jammed!

04:37.387 --> 04:39.013
My mom says we could stay all day.

04:39.097 --> 04:42.642
I heard girls just roam in packs
searching for guys.

04:42.725 --> 04:44.519
They've got this one roller coaster.

04:44.602 --> 04:47.730
It's so intense, they give you
a barf bag when you get on.

04:47.814 --> 04:49.357
I can't wait.

04:49.983 --> 04:51.442
Hey, what's up, big guy?

04:51.526 --> 04:54.112
David, I'm not in the mood for you today.

04:54.195 --> 04:56.572
In fact, I'm never in the mood for you.

04:56.656 --> 04:58.449
What did I do?
I'm just trying to be friendly.

04:58.533 --> 04:59.701
Yeah, I know the feeling.

04:59.784 --> 05:02.870
I invited my friends to Palm Springs
for the biggest weekend of the year.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.705
This morning my mom
conveniently tells me

05:04.789 --> 05:07.291
that I can't go because
she's having the house fumigated.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.919
- Oh, what a drag.
- Everybody's gonna kill me.

05:10.002 --> 05:11.671
I've been talking up this place
for weeks.

05:11.754 --> 05:13.464
We're supposed to leave
after school today.

05:13.548 --> 05:16.342
You know, my grandparents have
this incredible house in Palm Springs.

05:16.425 --> 05:18.386
- Great.
- When my dad and mom separated,

05:18.469 --> 05:19.804
my grandparents said that, you know,

05:19.887 --> 05:21.514
I could use the house
whenever I wanted to,

05:21.597 --> 05:23.599
like some sort of consolation prize
or something.

05:23.683 --> 05:25.142
Lucky you, David.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.812
They're away right now, in fact.

05:28.896 --> 05:32.066
They're away? Far away?

05:32.358 --> 05:35.277
On a world cruise
for the next two months.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.576
David, I'm sorry I snapped at you.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.954
I know you were
just trying to be friendly.

05:45.037 --> 05:48.999
Have I ever told you how glad I am
you and I have become good friends?

05:49.708 --> 05:53.087
- You and me?
- Yeah, you and me.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.175
You know, we're gonna do Palm Springs
like it has never been done before.

05:58.259 --> 05:59.718
No bikini left unturned.

05:59.802 --> 06:02.846
Steve, didn't you get my message?
I can't go.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.015
You're kidding me, right?

06:05.099 --> 06:07.893
I can't. I gotta work.
I left a message with your mom.

06:07.977 --> 06:10.354
No, no, no, Brandon,
Brandon, call in sick!

06:10.437 --> 06:14.483
Steve, some people don't get everything
handed to them on a silver platter.

06:14.566 --> 06:17.069
Brandon, I went to a lot of trouble here.

06:17.152 --> 06:19.071
Brandon... Come on,
you can't leave me alone

06:19.154 --> 06:21.073
with David Silver the whole weekend.

06:21.156 --> 06:23.283
- Since when was he going?
- Since today, okay?

06:23.367 --> 06:25.410
But don't worry, I'm gonna lock him
in the closet. Come on.

06:25.494 --> 06:27.746
Steve, you don't have to go.
We can go next weekend.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.665
That's like saying
let's do Christmas in July.

06:29.748 --> 06:32.209
Come on, Brandon,
nobody misses Palm Springs weekend.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.336
Well, I'm gonna have to.

06:40.217 --> 06:42.719
Well, maybe I can manage by myself.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.889
Donna, we're not going to Europe.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.474
You don't need three bags.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.810
Kelly, I have to dress
according to the guys we meet.

06:49.893 --> 06:55.482
I mean, high school guys, college guys,
grad-school guys, drop-out guys.

06:55.774 --> 06:58.735
You cannot dress the same
for all guys. No.

06:59.277 --> 07:02.030
I guess you have a point.
Bring everything.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.785
We'll go to Magic Mountain
next weekend.

07:06.868 --> 07:08.328
The pass is only good this weekend.

07:08.411 --> 07:10.372
Well, maybe you can
get your little brother to go.

07:10.455 --> 07:13.583
Look, I'm not gonna walk away from
the chance to be with Kelly and Steve

07:13.667 --> 07:15.168
for the three-day weekend of the year.

07:15.252 --> 07:17.379
Every babe from West Beverly,
Beverly Hills High,

07:17.462 --> 07:19.798
Brentwood and Santa Monica's
gonna be there.

07:19.881 --> 07:22.968
- You know how it is.
- No, I don't know how it is.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.011
I've never been there before.

07:25.261 --> 07:28.181
Look, I gotta go, all right?
I'll see you Tuesday.

07:28.556 --> 07:31.267
Will you guys come on? There's gonna
be a lot of traffic on the road.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.519
Hey, gang.

07:32.602 --> 07:34.979
Are we gonna have a blast or what?

07:37.607 --> 07:39.984
There's been a slight change of plans.

07:57.335 --> 07:59.504
Everything all right today, Willie? Good.

08:09.347 --> 08:13.142
- So, are you ready to order yet?
- Got any macaroni cheese?

08:13.601 --> 08:16.604
- Is it on the menu?
- It's not that hard to make.

08:16.687 --> 08:20.066
Curtis, I'm busy, okay?

08:23.611 --> 08:25.071
You here by yourself again?

08:25.154 --> 08:27.365
You're not a very good waiter, are you?

08:27.448 --> 08:29.992
Hey, I happen to be an excellent waiter.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.452
Move your hands.

08:34.705 --> 08:36.832
Only girls wear bracelets.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.086
This is a Guatemalan
friendship bracelet,

08:40.169 --> 08:43.005
and it happens to be very cool, okay?

08:43.339 --> 08:46.342
How come every time you come in here,
it takes you an hour to order, huh?

08:46.425 --> 08:48.594
Okay, don't have a cow.

08:49.678 --> 08:54.225
I'll take a gorilla-cheese sandwich
with pickles and French fries.

08:54.558 --> 08:56.977
Crispy, not all greasy.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.734
I could be in Palm Springs by now.

09:59.748 --> 10:02.125
I never thought it would be like this.

10:02.334 --> 10:05.003
- Did you see that one?
- Who?

10:05.295 --> 10:07.005
That one. That one right there.

10:07.088 --> 10:08.673
David, David, sit down!

10:09.591 --> 10:13.345
If we're gonna hang out,
you've got to at least attempt to be cool.

10:13.929 --> 10:15.597
Oh, okay,
so you think I should like hold off

10:15.680 --> 10:18.808
and give them, like,
a Johnny Depp-type attitude thing?

10:20.644 --> 10:21.811
Okay.

10:23.104 --> 10:24.606
I'll be right back.

10:26.566 --> 10:28.610
Okay, we'll be right back.

10:39.245 --> 10:42.123
I should have known
never to go anywhere with you.

10:42.207 --> 10:44.000
Don't worry. We'll have fun.

10:44.083 --> 10:48.087
With David Silver? I don't think so.

11:06.147 --> 11:09.525
Don't get the peanut butter-cheese
crackers. They're stale.

11:10.693 --> 11:12.403
Oh, thanks.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.490
You live around here?

11:16.157 --> 11:19.744
- No, I'm from L.A.
- L.A. Sucks.

11:21.037 --> 11:24.582
- Well, actually I live in Beverly Hills.
- Oh, really?

11:24.707 --> 11:27.752
- You're in for the big weekend?
- Yeah.

11:29.295 --> 11:32.757
- My name is Tuesday.
- Tuesday?

11:33.299 --> 11:37.720
- My favorite day of the week.
- You're cute.

11:38.721 --> 11:43.100
- You really from Beverly Hills?
- Yeah.

11:47.146 --> 11:49.565
I acted like I couldn't care less,
just like Johnny Depp,

11:49.648 --> 11:51.817
and she practically came on to me.

11:51.901 --> 11:53.486
So I invited her to the house tomorrow.

11:53.569 --> 11:55.571
She promised to bring
some friends just for you.

11:55.654 --> 11:57.782
Yeah, what are their names,
Monday and Wednesday?

11:57.865 --> 11:59.241
Actually, I didn't ask.

11:59.325 --> 12:00.743
- I probably should have, but...
- David.

12:00.826 --> 12:02.411
- What?
- Shut up.

12:10.961 --> 12:13.339
<i>Mademoiselle, your sweetheart awaits.</i>

12:13.839 --> 12:16.634
- What's wrong?
- It's weird. I mean,

12:17.092 --> 12:18.594
I want to be with Dylan and everything,

12:18.677 --> 12:20.471
but part of me
just wants to get it over with,

12:20.554 --> 12:23.182
like I'm the last person
who hasn't done it yet.

12:23.265 --> 12:26.685
- Brenda, you are.
- You are not.

12:26.894 --> 12:29.480
Look, Brenda, you're really gonna like it.

12:29.813 --> 12:31.815
Probably. Maybe.

12:31.899 --> 12:33.650
All right, listen,
who would you rather be with,

12:33.734 --> 12:36.028
Dylan McKay or David Silver?

12:39.781 --> 12:41.033
Come on, it's getting late.

12:41.116 --> 12:43.118
Dylan's a wonderful guy.
You're gonna have a great time.

12:43.202 --> 12:44.453
And you brought protection, right?

12:44.536 --> 12:46.205
So, there is nothing
to be worried about, right?

12:46.288 --> 12:48.790
Right, I mean, I care about him.
He cares about me.

12:48.874 --> 12:51.919
- It's gonna be great, right?
- Absolutely.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.775
Thank you very much. Enjoy your stay.

13:16.485 --> 13:19.029
- Hi.
- Good evening.

13:19.112 --> 13:20.739
I'm here to meet my...

13:22.115 --> 13:24.868
Dylan McKay. He checked in earlier.

13:29.122 --> 13:31.833
Are you sure it was
the Desert Palm Mirage?

13:31.916 --> 13:33.460
Yes, I'm sure.

13:34.627 --> 13:36.921
- I think.
- You think?

13:38.173 --> 13:40.675
Or was it the Palm Desert Mirage?

13:41.259 --> 13:43.595
Or the Palm Springs Desert Mirage?

13:43.678 --> 13:47.182
- Did you write the name down?
- Oh, I forgot about that.

13:47.265 --> 13:50.351
It's just that I've been
so excited since I got here.

13:53.188 --> 13:56.482
I've lost my wallet. Oh, my God.

14:00.028 --> 14:02.739
<i>My grandparents collect anything
they can get their hands on.</i>

14:03.072 --> 14:05.908
When I was younger
I used to travel with them,

14:05.992 --> 14:07.660
but my dad's mad at them
about something,

14:07.744 --> 14:09.412
so I don't see them much anymore.

14:09.495 --> 14:10.913
What's he mad about?

14:10.997 --> 14:13.166
Well, my grandparents like my mom,

14:13.249 --> 14:16.377
and think it's, you know,
bad he wants to divorce her.

14:16.669 --> 14:19.672
Well, come on,
I've saved the coolest part for last.

14:20.173 --> 14:21.591
Can't wait.

14:30.725 --> 14:32.560
This is cool!

14:36.147 --> 14:37.732
Nice pool! Look.

14:39.275 --> 14:43.321
Dude, we are definitely styling
out here in this little desert oasis.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.823
David, I always knew you had potential.

14:45.906 --> 14:47.158
Thanks, Steve.

14:47.283 --> 14:49.910
But you guys ain't seen nothing yet.

14:50.369 --> 14:52.997
Look, if anyone gets in the mood,

14:53.831 --> 14:57.376
you climb up this little terrace here
to this hidden nook,

14:57.460 --> 14:59.670
and nobody will bother you.

15:00.463 --> 15:03.507
Ready? Ready for this?

15:07.386 --> 15:09.972
- David!
- Grandma!

15:13.267 --> 15:15.436
What the hell are you doing here?

15:28.866 --> 15:33.787
- It was an amazing trip.
- It was indescribable.

15:34.121 --> 15:37.249
We would dance every night
under the stars.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.960
Oh, would somebody pull
the ice cream?

15:40.043 --> 15:42.921
- I got it.
- Triple chocolate chip.

15:43.005 --> 15:46.383
I mean, if we're gonna do it,
we should do it right, right?

15:46.466 --> 15:48.051
Well, it's still early.

15:48.135 --> 15:52.097
Well, I've never seen so many old fogies
on one boat in my whole life.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.725
I mean, it's like a floating rest home
is what it was.

15:54.808 --> 15:56.560
Henry, that's not so.

15:56.643 --> 15:58.645
But one day, we...

15:58.729 --> 16:00.647
We woke up and we both said,

16:00.731 --> 16:02.566
- "Let's go home!"
- "Let's go home!"

16:02.649 --> 16:05.110
I mean, we missed our little house
in the desert.

16:05.193 --> 16:06.403
We sure did.

16:08.155 --> 16:09.281
And lucky for us.

16:09.364 --> 16:12.701
We would have missed you
if we didn't cut our trip short.

16:13.493 --> 16:16.037
Well, you guys
must be really tired, huh?

16:16.121 --> 16:18.707
We're exhausted. But, hey, who cares?

16:18.790 --> 16:21.084
I am so excited to see you.

16:21.626 --> 16:24.087
And to finally meet some of your friends.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.214
Hey, why don't we all stay up really late,

16:26.298 --> 16:29.259
chow down on the snacks
and get to know each other?

16:39.269 --> 16:41.146
I don't believe this!

16:42.856 --> 16:45.608
- Miss, are you okay?
- No!

16:46.192 --> 16:48.695
I was supposed
to meet my boyfriend here,

16:48.862 --> 16:51.030
or it was somewhere
that sounded like here,

16:51.114 --> 16:52.365
but I lost the right address.

16:52.449 --> 16:54.742
Well, I lost my wallet. I lost my friends.

16:54.826 --> 16:57.954
And every single name
of every stupid hotel in this stupid town

16:58.037 --> 17:01.249
sounds exactly alike! They either start
with Palms, Desert or Mirage!

17:01.332 --> 17:04.042
I mean, how's anybody
supposed to find anybody?

17:04.127 --> 17:06.253
- Maybe you should call home?
- No!

17:06.337 --> 17:07.672
I'm supposed to be with my friends.

17:07.755 --> 17:09.965
How would I ever explain that
to my parents?

17:10.049 --> 17:12.635
I don't even have a place to stay tonight.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.762
I live right around the corner.

17:15.887 --> 17:18.598
You could stay with me.
I get off at midnight.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.643
My name's Tom.

17:34.949 --> 17:38.119
They're a little greasy,
to be honest with you.

17:41.998 --> 17:44.417
- Hey, there!
- Hey.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.377
What a nice surprise.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.546
I thought I'd cheer you up
since you didn't get to follow

17:48.629 --> 17:50.923
the mindless masses to Palm Springs.

17:51.173 --> 17:52.258
Big tip.

17:52.341 --> 17:53.592
Thanks.

17:54.093 --> 17:57.179
Ever get the feeling
the entire world is flying in first class,

17:57.263 --> 18:00.766
and you're stuck with a folding chair
in the baggage compartment?

18:00.850 --> 18:01.892
No.

18:03.978 --> 18:06.814
Liar. You liar.

18:07.940 --> 18:12.403
Hey, this is Curtis,
the hang-out king of Beverly Hills.

18:12.486 --> 18:15.281
It's a free country.
I can hang out if I want to.

18:15.364 --> 18:18.951
Hey, hey, hey, relax, sport.
No one said you couldn't.

18:20.119 --> 18:22.079
Does your mom know
how much time you spend here?

18:22.162 --> 18:24.373
She's the one who brung me.

18:24.498 --> 18:27.167
I told her the food's not that good.

18:28.127 --> 18:30.838
See what I have to put up with
to make a buck?

18:34.675 --> 18:36.593
Is he your boyfriend?

18:37.761 --> 18:41.515
No, we're just friends.

18:41.598 --> 18:44.601
You give him that friendship bracelet
he's wearing?

18:45.394 --> 18:46.645
No.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.439
Why aren't you wearing one?

18:54.236 --> 18:58.407
- No friends, huh?
- I have friends.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.784
I've got lots of friends.

19:04.204 --> 19:05.414
Here you go.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.459
Peach Pit.

19:09.543 --> 19:11.837
<i>- Brandon, is that you?
- Dylan.</i>

19:12.796 --> 19:16.800
- I didn't know you were in town.
- I'm not. I'm in Palm Springs.

19:16.883 --> 19:19.845
Yeah, you and everybody else
including Brenda.

19:19.928 --> 19:21.680
Do you know where she is?

19:21.972 --> 19:23.890
She's with Kelly and Donna.

19:23.974 --> 19:27.811
<i>Yeah, but they were supposed
to drop her off at my hotel...</i>

19:28.520 --> 19:30.689
- To stay with you?
- No.

19:31.606 --> 19:33.608
Well, yeah.

19:35.318 --> 19:36.778
Maybe she changed her mind.

19:36.861 --> 19:38.863
She didn't call or anything?

19:38.947 --> 19:40.991
<i>You know how she is
with Kelly and Donna.</i>

19:41.074 --> 19:44.077
All they were talking about was all
the guys they were gonna be scamming.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.495
Oh, great.

19:45.578 --> 19:47.914
Look, I'm at the Desert Mirage.

19:47.998 --> 19:50.250
So, tell her I called, if you talk to her.

19:50.333 --> 19:55.088
- Sure, have fun.
- Yeah. You, too.

20:04.556 --> 20:08.184
- Remember me?
- Janie?

20:12.397 --> 20:13.606
Yeah.

20:26.411 --> 20:28.371
Brenda, are you sure
you'll be okay in here?

20:28.454 --> 20:31.290
- I feel awful leaving you like this.
- No, this is great.

20:31.374 --> 20:34.001
It's so sweet of you
to have gone to all this trouble.

20:34.085 --> 20:35.795
Why don't you just come stay with me?

20:35.878 --> 20:38.673
- I'll sleep on the floor.
- I'll be fine.

20:40.633 --> 20:43.719
Here's my number and address

20:44.929 --> 20:49.100
just in case you need me
or you change your mind.

20:49.392 --> 20:50.643
Thanks.

20:56.941 --> 20:58.275
This way, ladies.

20:58.359 --> 21:01.112
Now, you're gonna go up those stairs,

21:01.195 --> 21:05.449
down the hall, first door on your right,
and you are gonna love it.

21:06.075 --> 21:08.285
- Good night.
- Good night. Thank you.

21:08.828 --> 21:10.496
Donna, did you hear her?

21:10.579 --> 21:12.498
She said she was gonna invite
all the cute guys

21:12.581 --> 21:14.625
from the neighborhood
over to the pool tomorrow.

21:14.708 --> 21:18.045
- Steve is not gonna like that.
- Who cares?

21:18.129 --> 21:20.047
I wonder how Brenda's doing?

21:20.381 --> 21:24.009
- "Dylan, what beautiful eyes you have."
- Too much.

21:44.947 --> 21:47.282
Well, here's a couple of pieces
you missed.

21:47.366 --> 21:50.244
You know,
David was awfully quiet tonight?

21:51.161 --> 21:53.497
He's just moody, just like his father.

21:53.580 --> 21:57.417
No, no, no. He's upset about
the divorce. He needs some attention.

21:58.126 --> 22:01.296
Look, why don't we just spend
all day tomorrow with him?

22:01.380 --> 22:02.714
I mean, he'll like that.

22:02.798 --> 22:04.258
That's a good idea.

22:04.550 --> 22:05.717
I'm so tired.

22:05.801 --> 22:07.928
Look, Steve, tomorrow will be
different, I promise.

22:08.011 --> 22:10.722
I'll get rid of my grandparents, and
we'll have the whole house to ourselves.

22:10.806 --> 22:12.599
Would you get out of my face?

22:12.683 --> 22:14.893
Sorry. I forgot my toothbrush.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.062
I shouldn't have come.
I shouldn't have...

22:17.145 --> 22:20.440
- What do you mean? What about Kelly?
- What about Kelly?

22:20.691 --> 22:22.692
Well, you still like her, don't you?

22:22.776 --> 22:26.446
I mean, you know, you can tell me.
We're friends, remember?

22:26.530 --> 22:29.658
Okay, okay, fine, you're over her,
and that's perfect,

22:29.741 --> 22:33.995
because tomorrow Tuesday's
bringing some girls just for you.

22:56.643 --> 23:00.688
Hi. I mean, good morning.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.067
<i>Good morning, honey.</i>

23:04.150 --> 23:06.778
<i>- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah, everything's wonderful.</i>

23:06.861 --> 23:08.279
Just great.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.492
Look, I was just checking in
'cause I know how much you worry.

23:12.575 --> 23:14.953
Oh, and I thought
you might be homesick.

23:15.036 --> 23:17.330
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, she's having a great time.

23:17.413 --> 23:20.291
<i>- Mom, is Brandon home?
- Yeah, you wanna talk to him?</i>

23:20.375 --> 23:21.501
Yeah.

23:21.751 --> 23:22.835
It's Brenda.

23:22.919 --> 23:25.088
Oh, hey, Bren, how's paradise?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.589
<i>Brandon, do you know where Dylan is?</i>

23:26.673 --> 23:29.425
Look, I was supposed to meet him here,
and I went to the wrong hotel.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.512
I lost my wallet. I have no idea
how to get a hold of Kelly and Donna.

23:32.595 --> 23:36.766
I had to sleep in a broom closet, and
if you tell Mom and Dad, I will kill you!

23:36.849 --> 23:38.267
Oh, my God!

23:39.519 --> 23:41.646
She's having a great time.

23:41.979 --> 23:44.774
<i>Did Dylan tell you
where he was staying?</i>

23:45.942 --> 23:47.860
The Desert Mirage.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.737
He called last night looking for you.

23:49.821 --> 23:52.114
Was he gonna stay there
and wait for me?

23:52.198 --> 23:53.699
I don't know.

23:54.617 --> 23:57.536
Kelly and Donna are
at David Silver's grandparents' house.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.914
Henry Silver. Steve said
it's the only one in the book.

23:59.997 --> 24:02.375
<i>- Thanks, I gotta go!
- Hey, Brenda, wait.</i>

24:03.167 --> 24:04.627
Where are you gonna be?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.337
Where do you think?

24:14.303 --> 24:16.013
Those crazy kids.

24:21.268 --> 24:22.645
Hope I'm not too early.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.648
I brought my friends to meet your friend.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.025
They love Corvettes.

24:29.818 --> 24:31.529
Nice wheels, man.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.905
Aces.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.453
Excuse me.

24:45.334 --> 24:46.752
Come on in.

25:10.525 --> 25:13.237
- Brenda, hi.
- Hi.

25:24.831 --> 25:27.793
- I don't believe this!
- Wait a minute, I can explain.

25:27.876 --> 25:30.629
- Did she spend the night?
- You were supposed to be here at 6:00.

25:30.712 --> 25:32.672
Oh, so you just picked up
on somebody else!

25:32.756 --> 25:36.259
- It's not how it looks.
- I knew I couldn't trust you!

25:37.052 --> 25:41.681
- Dylan, should I come back later?
- No, you stay. I'll leave.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.309
I never want to see you again.

25:45.143 --> 25:49.940
- Brenda, nothing happened!
- Yeah, right.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.944
Oh, damn it.

25:59.908 --> 26:03.328
"Come on, Brenda,
I've been totally faithful for months!"

26:03.411 --> 26:04.829
What bogus!

26:04.913 --> 26:07.207
You know, there are plenty of guys
who are interested in me!

26:07.290 --> 26:09.334
Plenty! I have been so blind.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.128
Okay.

26:20.595 --> 26:23.723
- Where's Dylan?
- He's in the bathroom.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.019
Listen, I'm Janie.

26:29.604 --> 26:31.189
Brenda, I'm really glad you came back

26:31.272 --> 26:34.275
so we can all discuss this
like mature individuals.

26:35.234 --> 26:37.945
Janie? Is this your purse?

26:39.072 --> 26:40.239
Yeah.

26:41.115 --> 26:42.575
What are you doing?

26:48.122 --> 26:50.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.127
Janie had to leave.

26:53.419 --> 26:55.963
- Did you sleep with her?
- No, I didn't.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.673
Then what was she doing here?

26:57.757 --> 27:00.134
She grew up across the street from me.

27:00.218 --> 27:01.928
And you wanted to sleep with her, right?

27:02.011 --> 27:03.930
- Brenda...
- Yes or no?

27:04.513 --> 27:08.726
Well, yes,
in a theoretical kind of a thing.

27:08.934 --> 27:10.186
I don't believe this.

27:10.269 --> 27:12.605
What do you want me to do, lie about it?

27:12.688 --> 27:15.274
Wanting and doing
are two different things.

27:15.358 --> 27:17.693
All right, then, you're right.

27:19.737 --> 27:21.030
Well, let's just do it.

27:21.113 --> 27:22.448
Let's do it and get it over with.

27:22.531 --> 27:25.117
I mean, I'm a normal female.
You're a normal male.

27:25.201 --> 27:26.494
You have needs. I have needs.

27:26.577 --> 27:28.621
Let's do it and get it over with.

27:28.704 --> 27:30.414
- Brenda...
- Dylan,

27:30.998 --> 27:33.792
stop talking and take off your clothes.

27:47.181 --> 27:49.224
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

27:50.559 --> 27:53.437
- Good pie, huh?
- The Apple Pan is better.

27:53.937 --> 27:55.647
So, why do you come here?

28:06.658 --> 28:08.702
- Thanks for the tip.
- You're welcome.

28:08.785 --> 28:11.121
You're not a great waiter,
but you're getting better.

28:11.205 --> 28:14.082
- I appreciate that.
- You work tomorrow?

28:16.084 --> 28:19.421
I got dinner tonight
and another double tomorrow, yeah.

28:20.047 --> 28:21.757
Another bad mood.

28:22.174 --> 28:24.092
I probably won't be around.

28:24.176 --> 28:27.179
- Why not?
- Stuff to do. You know how it is.

28:28.889 --> 28:30.640
You're a mysterious guy, you know that?

28:30.724 --> 28:32.726
- I gotta go.
- Well, hey,

28:32.976 --> 28:34.936
stop by tomorrow and say hi.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.605
You gotta eat, right?

29:42.003 --> 29:43.755
- Tequila!
- Tequila!

29:52.346 --> 29:54.932
You guys don't have to take care of us.
We're fine. Really.

29:55.016 --> 29:56.809
That's all right, sweetheart. We want to.

29:56.893 --> 29:59.353
All the kids like to come over here
to hang out. We don't mind.

29:59.437 --> 30:01.772
Yeah, but don't you guys have
something else you wanna do today?

30:01.856 --> 30:03.983
Like the movies or golf
or shopping or something?

30:04.066 --> 30:06.152
- No.
- No, we just wanna be with you.

30:06.235 --> 30:07.778
Yeah. Tequila!

30:20.207 --> 30:22.793
You know,
there's room on this raft for two.

30:23.210 --> 30:26.714
Why don't you ask your new girlfriends?
They look interested.

30:30.009 --> 30:32.678
Yeah, it wasn't too long ago
that you were interested, Kelly.

30:32.761 --> 30:34.597
The good old days, yeah.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.516
Can you imagine what it would be like
if we were still going out?

30:37.600 --> 30:41.312
You know, Kelly, we were
the best relationship I've ever had.

30:41.395 --> 30:43.522
Steve, I was the only relationship
you ever had.

30:43.606 --> 30:45.441
See how loyal I was.

30:46.442 --> 30:48.777
Kelly, I think we should go out again.

30:49.236 --> 30:52.323
- Steve...
- Now listen, think before you answer.

30:52.406 --> 30:54.158
We were good.

31:02.458 --> 31:06.128
I love your top.
Would you consider a trade?

31:09.423 --> 31:12.092
It's important to protect yourself.

31:12.801 --> 31:14.469
That feels good.

31:15.888 --> 31:18.182
Great. We better put on more.

31:19.099 --> 31:22.060
David? David, your friends are here.

31:22.227 --> 31:23.520
Oh, God!

31:23.604 --> 31:25.063
Why can't I have normal grandparents

31:25.147 --> 31:28.609
who do crossword puzzles
and take lots of naps?

31:28.734 --> 31:30.319
Come on, honey.

31:38.285 --> 31:39.786
Hey, when did you kids get in town?

31:39.870 --> 31:41.872
- Yesterday.
- Last night.

31:42.873 --> 31:44.207
Dylan, man, what's up?

31:44.291 --> 31:47.002
I would have invited you if I had known
you were gonna be in town.

31:47.085 --> 31:49.087
Yeah. Brenda, is there someplace

31:49.171 --> 31:53.341
- we can talk privately?
- I don't wanna talk to you.

31:53.425 --> 31:54.593
Look, just go.

31:54.676 --> 31:56.261
You dropped me off. You did your duty.

31:56.344 --> 31:58.638
- Now, thank you.
- Bren, you're not being fair.

31:58.722 --> 31:59.806
Fair?

31:59.890 --> 32:02.309
I made a fool out of myself,
and you turned me down.

32:02.392 --> 32:03.893
Now, that wasn't fair.

32:03.977 --> 32:08.898
I didn't turn you down, I just...
I don't wanna be pressured into it.

32:09.274 --> 32:11.568
Well, now you know how it feels,
don't you?

32:11.651 --> 32:14.779
Brenda! How are you?

32:16.823 --> 32:19.492
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

32:24.998 --> 32:27.709
It was very nice to meet you, really.

32:31.171 --> 32:33.590
My friends really dig you.

32:36.926 --> 32:38.094
Buddy!

32:38.386 --> 32:40.263
- How's it going?
- Don't ask.

32:40.346 --> 32:42.015
Yeah, tell me about it. I'll tell you what,

32:42.098 --> 32:44.392
I'll call the SWAT team.
You call the dog catcher, all right?

32:44.475 --> 32:46.686
What's with these girls?
They want sex. They don't want sex.

32:46.769 --> 32:48.021
They like you. They hate you.

32:48.104 --> 32:50.857
They see you with another girl,
they think you're sleeping with her,

32:50.940 --> 32:52.108
even if you're not.

32:52.191 --> 32:54.777
- Can I get you guys anything?
- Yeah, someplace to hide.

32:54.861 --> 32:57.113
A little understanding would be nice.

32:57.196 --> 33:00.533
Look, I'm gonna make you a nice lunch.
Things will settle down.

33:00.616 --> 33:02.702
We're gonna have fun, you'll see.

33:02.785 --> 33:04.704
Hope we make it to lunch.

33:04.787 --> 33:06.873
Davey-boy, time to light up the grill.

33:06.956 --> 33:10.293
Hamburgers and hot dogs
are good for whatever ails you.

33:11.252 --> 33:13.713
I think we may go out for lunch.

33:13.796 --> 33:15.798
Oh, what a good idea.

33:15.881 --> 33:18.843
- We'll take them to Burger Barn, honey.
- Yeah.

33:18.926 --> 33:21.262
There's a Putt-Putt right next door and...

33:21.345 --> 33:23.806
What do you call those?
A water slide down the street.

33:23.889 --> 33:26.058
- Does that sound like fun?
- Yeah.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.688
But I'd really appreciate it
if you guys didn't come along.

33:30.771 --> 33:33.441
Well, I...
I want to be with my friends today.

33:33.858 --> 33:36.193
David, all of your friends like us.

33:36.277 --> 33:38.070
They're just being polite.

33:41.448 --> 33:43.200
As opposed to being rude?

33:45.786 --> 33:48.372
You're the one who doesn't like us.

33:48.664 --> 33:50.332
You're not right to...

33:52.585 --> 33:54.545
How could you say something like that?

33:54.628 --> 33:55.921
Grandpa!

34:12.187 --> 34:15.983
Hey, one time I thought Henry
was fooling around

34:16.065 --> 34:18.402
with this bimbo in his office.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.947
All the signs were there, I thought.

34:22.030 --> 34:23.782
Did I say one word?

34:25.242 --> 34:29.329
Isn't it funny how communication
goes right out the window

34:29.413 --> 34:31.665
when you're scared and hurt?

34:33.417 --> 34:36.503
I'm glad you got out of there while
you could. She can go on for hours.

34:36.585 --> 34:38.213
Before we got married,

34:38.755 --> 34:42.551
Adele broke up with me
seven different times.

34:43.677 --> 34:47.931
I mean, that was our solution
to every problem, run for the hills.

34:50.851 --> 34:54.478
Being able to trust somebody
with your feelings,

34:55.188 --> 34:57.274
that's the hardest thing.

34:57.566 --> 35:03.238
I mean that and
letting the other person be who they are

35:03.822 --> 35:06.366
versus who you want them to be.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.335
So no one will bother us.

35:30.098 --> 35:33.726
You know, earlier today, I really wanted

35:34.644 --> 35:37.230
to lick your shoulders at the pool.

35:55.832 --> 35:57.500
I can't do this.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.293
What? What's wrong?

35:59.377 --> 36:01.838
I can't do this.

36:01.921 --> 36:04.048
- I'll unlock the door.
- No.

36:04.215 --> 36:08.219
- I thought you were sweet.
- I am sweet.

36:08.845 --> 36:10.680
You don't understand.

36:10.763 --> 36:13.975
I miss my boyfriend. He blew me off,

36:14.058 --> 36:16.519
and you kind of look like him.

36:16.602 --> 36:20.398
Except he's better-looking and taller.

36:23.776 --> 36:26.570
All my friends said
I should go for it with you,

36:26.654 --> 36:28.364
forget about him.

36:28.531 --> 36:30.491
But it is not working!

36:38.332 --> 36:43.420
Look, when you find that person
that you can really be yourself with...

36:44.505 --> 36:46.757
Who you can have fun with...

36:47.675 --> 36:49.134
And trust...

36:50.553 --> 36:55.933
It is the greatest blessing in the world.

37:50.946 --> 37:52.322
Oh, great.

38:02.499 --> 38:03.834
Curtis, what...

38:06.461 --> 38:07.629
Come here.

38:08.838 --> 38:10.632
What are you doing?
Are you trying to rip me off?

38:10.715 --> 38:14.135
- Are you gonna turn me in?
- No, I'm gonna call your parents.

38:14.219 --> 38:17.138
- We don't have a phone.
- Don't lie to me!

38:18.056 --> 38:19.349
What's the matter with you?

38:19.432 --> 38:21.643
Are you one of those little brats
who gets a kick out of stealing

38:21.726 --> 38:23.561
from people who try to be nice to you?

38:23.645 --> 38:27.232
- What's your phone number, Curtis?
- We don't have one.

38:27.607 --> 38:28.900
Anymore.

38:30.402 --> 38:32.779
My mom and brother and me

38:34.364 --> 38:37.075
don't have a place to live right now.

38:40.203 --> 38:44.165
People give us spare change
so they don't have to feel weird.

38:45.291 --> 38:48.378
Then I saw all the money you had
in the cash register,

38:50.213 --> 38:52.423
so I unlocked the window
in the bathroom

38:52.507 --> 38:54.884
when I was here this afternoon.

39:04.602 --> 39:05.770
Okay.

39:06.312 --> 39:08.856
Don't worry. I won't tell anybody.

39:09.524 --> 39:11.818
Why didn't you say something?

39:11.901 --> 39:15.780
I don't want nobody to know
I don't have a house.

39:25.665 --> 39:28.334
Hey, listen,
why don't we make some food?

39:28.417 --> 39:31.504
You can take it
to your mom and your brother.

39:32.797 --> 39:35.091
She likes hamburgers.

39:36.258 --> 39:40.012
- French fries?
- Crispy, not greasy.

39:51.023 --> 39:54.610
- This is good.
- Oh, so now you're full of compliments.

39:55.361 --> 39:57.947
Hey, listen, here's the food.
Take it to your mom.

39:58.030 --> 40:00.115
Tell her to come in.
Maybe we can help or something.

40:00.199 --> 40:01.283
Okay.

40:01.367 --> 40:04.703
And you promise me
you're not gonna steal anymore?

40:04.787 --> 40:07.164
I wasn't any good at it anyway.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.293
Hey, Curtis. Stick out your wrist.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.349
You're giving
your friendship bracelet to me?

40:26.100 --> 40:27.267
Yeah.

40:32.731 --> 40:35.859
You want me to go with you?
It is awfully late.

40:36.235 --> 40:38.362
No. I wanna go by myself.

40:45.452 --> 40:48.997
Hey, Curtis,
you know where I am if you need me.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.708
I'll be okay, don't worry.

41:00.884 --> 41:01.968
Okay, come on.

41:02.052 --> 41:03.261
Movie!

41:04.513 --> 41:06.973
- Two fingers.
- Two words.

41:08.225 --> 41:09.976
- The whole thing.
- Okay.

41:13.188 --> 41:14.689
Brenda Walsh!

41:14.856 --> 41:16.608
Good one, Donna.

41:19.319 --> 41:20.695
That girl.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.823
<i>- That Girl.
- No, that was a TV show.</i>

41:23.907 --> 41:25.659
I think I know. I think I know it.

41:25.742 --> 41:27.535
Heart... Heartbeat.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.120
<i>Heartbeeps.</i>

41:33.750 --> 41:36.294
<i>I know! Pretty Woman!</i>

41:43.718 --> 41:46.346
- Terrific.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

41:46.429 --> 41:48.014
Okay, guys win.

41:48.890 --> 41:50.225
All right.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.227
Hey, anybody for some more ice cream?

41:52.310 --> 41:53.811
- Oh, me, me, me.
- You, you, you.

41:53.895 --> 41:55.563
- Yeah. Chocolate chip.
- Come on.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.649
Oh, God!

42:02.528 --> 42:05.073
Have you given any thought
to what we were talking about before?

42:05.156 --> 42:07.867
- Actually, I have.
- You have?

42:09.202 --> 42:10.286
You know, I thought

42:10.370 --> 42:13.206
what David's grandparents said before
was really true.

42:13.289 --> 42:16.959
If you communicate your feelings
and be honest,

42:17.043 --> 42:20.379
and you just try and be yourself,
then things can work out.

42:20.588 --> 42:24.133
- I agree, totally.
- You do?

42:27.345 --> 42:30.890
- Do you wanna go out again, Kelly?
- No.

42:40.066 --> 42:41.150
Voila.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.028
Thank you, king of the charade players.

42:44.612 --> 42:47.281
- Can I help?
- Sure.

42:50.201 --> 42:53.704
I guess you've noticed my friends
think you guys are the greatest.

42:53.788 --> 42:56.791
Guess I was the last one
to realize how lucky I am.

42:56.874 --> 43:00.169
Well, sometimes things
work out that way.

43:01.212 --> 43:03.380
I've been a jerk, haven't I?

43:05.049 --> 43:06.258
I'm sorry.

43:06.342 --> 43:10.429
You know, it just felt like
the whole family was falling apart.

43:11.180 --> 43:13.724
But the three of us don't have to.

43:14.433 --> 43:16.310
Absolutely not.

43:17.978 --> 43:19.355
Oh, David.

43:21.231 --> 43:23.442
You know,
we really like your friends a lot?

43:23.525 --> 43:24.651
Yeah.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.653
Well, actually my best friend is Scott.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.238
He probably just got back
from Magic Mountain.

43:28.322 --> 43:31.074
You know, I gotta call him,
see how he's doing.

43:31.158 --> 43:33.535
You know,
he's never been to Palm Springs.

43:33.619 --> 43:36.663
Maybe I should see if he wants
to come down here next weekend.

43:36.747 --> 43:39.833
Wouldn't that be great?
We can do this all over again.

43:48.342 --> 43:50.719
I'd love to have a house like this.

43:50.802 --> 43:53.805
Then you'd have David Silver
for a grandson.

43:56.266 --> 43:59.186
Could you imagine us
having grandchildren?

44:00.479 --> 44:03.648
You mean, like, married?
With children?

44:04.608 --> 44:07.778
- And grandchildren?
- Yes, Pa.

44:07.986 --> 44:12.699
Well, hey, little lady,
we'll take it one step at a time.

44:15.952 --> 44:18.079
You didn't kiss her, did you?

44:18.205 --> 44:20.373
Brenda, I don't believe you.

44:20.457 --> 44:23.627
Well, I mean,
it's not like I haven't had opportunities.

44:24.377 --> 44:27.547
- When did you have an opportunity?
- Well, what does it matter?

44:27.631 --> 44:30.008
Watching and doing
are two different things, remember?

44:30.091 --> 44:32.344
That's what you told me when
I caught you with whatshername.

44:32.427 --> 44:35.138
Her name was Janie,
and that was totally different.

44:35.221 --> 44:38.349
Well, his name was Tom,
and that was totally different.

44:39.559 --> 44:40.685
Tom.

44:41.478 --> 44:43.188
Tom. Thomas.

44:43.271 --> 44:45.732
- Tom. Thomas. Tom.
- Stop. Dylan.

44:45.815 --> 44:46.858
- What?
- Stop!

44:46.941 --> 44:48.568
Okay, no, Janie...

44:48.651 --> 44:49.986
Oh, God!

44:50.069 --> 44:51.905
Brenda, I'm sorry...

44:52.572 --> 44:55.408
Oh, hi, honey.
You wanna watch a movie with us?

44:56.117 --> 44:58.953
No, thanks. I'm pretty zoned.

45:03.291 --> 45:05.627
It looks like a zoo down there.

45:08.129 --> 45:10.298
Listen, Brandon,
we know this hasn't been exactly

45:10.381 --> 45:12.383
a fun-filled weekend for you.

45:12.467 --> 45:13.634
It's been okay.

45:13.718 --> 45:16.262
Yeah, but we know
how hard you're working,

45:16.596 --> 45:19.057
and if your heart is truly set
on getting a new car,

45:19.140 --> 45:21.726
we probably can help you out a little bit.

45:23.186 --> 45:24.812
It's all right.

45:25.062 --> 45:29.150
I can definitely get by with another
old bomber like Mondale for a while.

45:29.358 --> 45:32.320
I thought you said Mondale
was a piece of junk?

45:32.403 --> 45:34.113
I love Mondale.

45:35.698 --> 45:37.825
I'm a lucky guy, you know.

45:40.911 --> 45:43.039
Love you guys. Good night.

45:43.873 --> 45:45.916
- Night.
- Night.
