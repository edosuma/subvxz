WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.303
We need Emma
at the trial.

00:04.605 --> 00:05.839
I can't allow that.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.708
Brad--
She's 10-years old.

00:07.741 --> 00:08.742
I understand that.

00:08.775 --> 00:09.843
BRAD: I said no!

00:09.876 --> 00:11.377
She's a child.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.280
Listen to me.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.350
You have serious
monster issues here,

00:17.383 --> 00:20.186
to the world
and to the potential jury pool,

00:20.220 --> 00:21.755
you are the man

00:21.788 --> 00:23.256
who murdered his pregnant wife

00:23.289 --> 00:24.691
and unborn son.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.927
The best way to humanize you

00:26.960 --> 00:29.062
is to let the jury see you
as a father

00:29.095 --> 00:30.597
and not a killer,

00:30.631 --> 00:32.766
and the best way
to accomplish that

00:32.799 --> 00:33.867
is to have your daughter

00:33.900 --> 00:35.502
by your side,

00:35.536 --> 00:36.737
at your side.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.505
And what will that do to her?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.273
To have to sit there
and listen while her father

00:40.306 --> 00:43.143
is demonized before--
FRUTT: She's already hearing

00:43.176 --> 00:44.778
that everywhere she turns.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.780
I think the real question is,

00:46.813 --> 00:47.681
"What will it do to her

00:47.714 --> 00:49.449
to see you go to prison?"

00:49.482 --> 00:52.185
Which is exactly
what we're looking at.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.233
You need to get me out
on bail, Ellenor.

01:00.266 --> 01:02.368
Brad, you are up
on double homicide.

01:02.402 --> 01:03.537
I hardly think--
BRAD: You need to think

01:03.570 --> 01:05.138
of a way.

01:05.171 --> 01:07.273
I need to address
the potential jury pool.

01:07.307 --> 01:10.010
For that, I need
to have a news conference.

01:10.043 --> 01:12.078
To do that,
I got to get out of here.

01:12.112 --> 01:14.080
The judge is never going--
BRAD: Ellenor,

01:15.381 --> 01:17.450
I need you to start
demonstrating the zeal

01:17.483 --> 01:18.952
that comes with defending

01:18.985 --> 01:20.787
an innocent man.

01:21.755 --> 01:25.158
Homicide suspects
are sometimes afforded bail.

01:25.191 --> 01:27.628
I need you to accomplish
that courtesy

01:27.661 --> 01:30.163
for me now.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.337
(music playing)

02:18.518 --> 02:19.352
(door closes)

02:23.924 --> 02:26.392
Gentlemen,
thank you for coming in.

02:32.398 --> 02:34.901
I'm informed you still plan
to argue self-defense?

02:34.935 --> 02:37.604
Actually, defense of others,
but same principle.

02:37.638 --> 02:39.439
You will not be arguing
self-defense

02:39.472 --> 02:41.407
or defense of others,
Mr. Young.

02:41.441 --> 02:43.009
There's no factual
basis for it,

02:43.043 --> 02:44.711
and it won't be asserted.

02:46.179 --> 02:48.248
Well, we have to be allowed
to put on a defense.

02:48.281 --> 02:50.050
Well, you won't be allowed
to put on that one.

02:51.317 --> 02:53.219
Let's watch it together,
shall we?

02:53.253 --> 02:54.721
We've all seen the tape.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.190
You'll see it again with me.

03:01.134 --> 03:02.368
Here comes your client.

03:02.402 --> 03:05.338
(music playing)

03:11.077 --> 03:12.579
HARROD:
If you so much as attempt

03:12.613 --> 03:14.848
to argue self-defense
or defense of others,

03:14.881 --> 03:16.783
I will hold you
in contempt of court.

03:17.884 --> 03:19.219
Are we clear, gentlemen?

03:24.124 --> 03:26.126
Then we'd like to change
our plea, Your Honor.

03:26.159 --> 03:27.093
To?

03:27.127 --> 03:28.494
Insanity.

03:28.529 --> 03:29.996
And what's your basis for that?

03:30.030 --> 03:31.464
You saw the tape.

03:32.666 --> 03:33.634
She's crazy.

03:41.374 --> 03:42.609
Young, Frutt, and Berluti?

03:42.643 --> 03:44.244
Insanity?
That's all we got left.

03:44.277 --> 03:45.712
Tara?
Jamie,

03:45.746 --> 03:46.747
I need that motion
in limiting.

03:46.780 --> 03:47.848
Uh, please hold.

03:47.881 --> 03:49.616
I went through the list
of doctors.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.417
Two are willing to testify,

03:51.451 --> 03:53.520
but they want
their full retainer.

03:53.554 --> 03:54.788
And you have another problem.

03:55.856 --> 03:57.190
Markham got called.

03:57.223 --> 03:58.158
For when?

03:58.191 --> 03:59.860
For now.
Judge Dickem.

03:59.893 --> 04:01.635
Did you tell--
I did. He won't budge.

04:02.769 --> 04:04.304
Jamie, can you do the pretrial?

04:04.337 --> 04:05.371
Me? Oh, yeah.

04:05.405 --> 04:06.873
If we don't find a shrink,

04:06.907 --> 04:08.842
we might as well--
We will.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.043
Keep looking.

04:10.076 --> 04:11.645
Come on, let's go
see the client.

04:11.678 --> 04:12.445
Call Dickem's clerk.

04:12.478 --> 04:13.514
I need to speak
to him personally.

04:13.547 --> 04:15.048
Ellenor.

04:15.081 --> 04:17.382
Alan, hey, what's up?

04:17.416 --> 04:18.685
Do you have a second?

04:18.719 --> 04:19.952
Actually, I don't.

04:19.986 --> 04:21.688
Something came up
at Caruthers.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.156
I left.

04:23.189 --> 04:25.225
Now I'm looking
for new employment.

04:25.258 --> 04:26.893
And since my heart
has always yearned

04:26.927 --> 04:28.494
to do whatever this is.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.364
What exactly came up
at Caruthers, Alan?

04:31.397 --> 04:32.666
I embezzled,

04:33.533 --> 04:34.634
allegedly.

04:34.668 --> 04:36.803
Could I have
some coffee, please,

04:36.836 --> 04:38.004
with cream?

04:38.037 --> 04:39.973
Thank you.

04:40.006 --> 04:41.808
I'd be such a natural here.

04:41.842 --> 04:42.643
FRUTT: Wait a second.

04:42.676 --> 04:44.110
You expect me to recommend you

04:44.144 --> 04:46.179
for employment
after you stole?

04:46.212 --> 04:48.181
The important thing is...

04:49.182 --> 04:51.918
I feel icky.

04:51.952 --> 04:54.454
Alan--
I'm the leading antitrust lawyer

04:54.487 --> 04:55.255
in the state.

04:55.288 --> 04:56.189
I'm going through

04:56.222 --> 04:57.924
an enormous character growth--

04:57.958 --> 04:59.726
Just the same--
And I need a break.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.871
I'll tell you what.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.540
You do a case for us today,

05:06.573 --> 05:07.541
see how you like it.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.109
Today? I could--
Misdemeanor battery,

05:09.142 --> 05:10.677
homeless person
kissed somebody.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.579
You certainly
don't expect me to walk in

05:12.613 --> 05:13.747
and try a case on the fly.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.348
If there's any problem,

05:15.381 --> 05:16.449
I will be on vibrate.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.484
Elly, Elly.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.887
(sighs)

05:20.921 --> 05:23.189
I have issues
with homeless people.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.725
What issues?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.259
They don't like me.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.928
I think it must be cultural.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.063
Look, I am late for a motion.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.566
You try the case,
then we'll talk.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.271
Bugger.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.473
(door buzzes)

05:40.507 --> 05:42.408
AISHA:
Isn't it up to a jury?

05:42.442 --> 05:43.510
I don't get a jury?

05:43.544 --> 05:45.111
YOUNG: You do.
But, unfortunately,

05:45.145 --> 05:46.513
the judge can cut off a defense

05:46.547 --> 05:47.981
if he feels
it's not supported.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.283
What do I do?
I'm dead.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.222
Our only choice now
is insanity.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.725
I wasn't insane.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.660
YOUNG: Understood.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.668
But it's the only
mechanism we have left

06:01.702 --> 06:03.003
to secure an acquittal.

06:04.370 --> 06:06.472
Shooting that man

06:06.507 --> 06:08.041
was maybe the most
clearheaded thing

06:08.074 --> 06:09.810
I ever did in my life.

06:10.476 --> 06:11.712
Not anymore.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.650
MAN: Case number 2246--

06:16.683 --> 06:19.352
Wait, you're his lawyer?

06:19.385 --> 06:20.854
Is there a problem?

06:20.887 --> 06:22.589
You're Alan Shore.

06:22.623 --> 06:24.324
What are you doing
at a criminal bench trial?

06:24.357 --> 06:26.527
Looking to meet women.

06:27.460 --> 06:28.529
I perused the file,

06:28.562 --> 06:30.864
and I think we can both
agree it's beneath us.

06:30.897 --> 06:32.799
So why don't we
dispose of it,

06:32.833 --> 06:34.000
go get a drink?

06:34.034 --> 06:35.769
The victim filed,

06:35.802 --> 06:38.104
and my boss won't kick
civilian complaints.

06:38.138 --> 06:40.273
It's not like anybody
got hurt, Cindy.

06:40.306 --> 06:41.441
May I call you Cindy?

06:41.474 --> 06:42.876
My name is Kate.

06:42.909 --> 06:44.177
Kate.
Hmm.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.546
Sixty days.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.481
Is this the way
it's gonna be?

06:48.515 --> 06:49.816
Hey, if you can get
the victim

06:49.850 --> 06:52.185
to withdraw,
the drink's on me.

06:52.218 --> 06:54.054
Otherwise,
take the offer

06:54.087 --> 06:56.156
to your client,
who's, uh,

06:56.189 --> 06:57.190
right over there

06:57.223 --> 06:58.959
in case
you haven't met him.

07:05.706 --> 07:06.940
(sighs)

07:09.409 --> 07:11.645
Mr. Markham,
I'm Alan Shore, your attorney.

07:12.579 --> 07:13.914
What happened
to Ms. Frutt?

07:13.947 --> 07:15.348
She's tied up,

07:15.381 --> 07:16.850
nothing sexual,
I assure you.

07:16.883 --> 07:18.619
I'll be taking
over the case.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.822
So, how are we today, sir?

07:21.855 --> 07:24.157
I just Halle Berry'd her.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.592
That's all I did.

07:25.626 --> 07:27.027
I beg your pardon?

07:27.060 --> 07:28.829
Like at the Oscars?

07:29.963 --> 07:31.832
The guy just planted one on her

07:31.865 --> 07:33.567
'cause when else
would he get a chance?

07:34.367 --> 07:35.569
That's all I did.

07:37.571 --> 07:38.572
I see.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.676
KANE: We all knew
it was a crack house,

07:42.709 --> 07:44.144
and a lot of us were upset,

07:44.177 --> 07:45.445
especially Aisha.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.648
She lost a child
to a drive-by

07:47.681 --> 07:48.515
three years ago.

07:48.549 --> 07:51.417
ASHER: Now, sir,
calling attention

07:51.451 --> 07:53.954
to the afternoon
of July 3rd,

07:53.987 --> 07:55.922
could you tell us
what you saw?

07:55.956 --> 07:57.390
KANE: Yeah.

07:57.423 --> 07:58.859
Well, there were a bunch of us

07:58.892 --> 08:00.233
kind of sprucing up the street

08:00.266 --> 08:03.870
'cause we were planning
a July 4th block party,

08:03.904 --> 08:07.440
and then there we saw him.

08:07.473 --> 08:08.474
Saw who?

08:08.509 --> 08:09.710
Marcus Thayer,

08:09.743 --> 08:11.645
crack dealer,

08:11.678 --> 08:13.079
selling his stuff on the steps

08:13.113 --> 08:15.816
like he did every damn day.

08:15.849 --> 08:17.450
He had some clients there.

08:17.483 --> 08:19.152
ASHER: And what happened?

08:19.185 --> 08:22.756
KANE: Well, Aisha,
she went right up to him,

08:22.789 --> 08:24.357
and she started telling him
this and that.

08:24.390 --> 08:25.726
"Get your ass off the street."

08:25.759 --> 08:27.994
He got in her face
like he always does,

08:28.028 --> 08:29.395
and they're yelling
back and forth

08:29.429 --> 08:30.296
at each other.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.899
And then she just walked off.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.400
After she left,
what happened?

08:35.434 --> 08:37.136
Well, then I got
into it with him,

08:37.169 --> 08:39.438
and he came at me
just like he did her.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.475
And I told him,
"He better not be out there

08:42.509 --> 08:45.579
pushing his crack
during our block party."

08:45.612 --> 08:47.981
And we talked
a little bit more trash.

08:48.014 --> 08:49.883
And as I started off,

08:49.916 --> 08:53.019
I looked up,
and here she comes again,

08:53.053 --> 08:55.188
and now she's got a gun.

08:55.221 --> 08:56.422
And she's saying something,

08:56.456 --> 08:58.759
but the truth be told,
I couldn't hear it.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.834
My eyes were on that gun.

09:00.867 --> 09:02.368
She walked right up to him,

09:02.402 --> 09:06.472
she aims,
and she shoots him three times.

09:07.273 --> 09:09.676
Shot him dead right there
in the street.

09:13.213 --> 09:14.447
ASHER: Mr. Kane,

09:14.480 --> 09:16.216
could you describe for us

09:16.249 --> 09:17.718
Ms. Crenshaw's demeanor

09:17.751 --> 09:19.119
as she fired the gun?

09:21.655 --> 09:23.089
She looked fed-up.

09:24.525 --> 09:25.659
ASHER: Thank you.

09:32.298 --> 09:34.200
You said this Mr.Thayer

09:34.234 --> 09:37.237
sold crack every day.

09:37.270 --> 09:40.306
Why didn't you people
just call the police?

09:40.340 --> 09:41.441
KANE: We called them
all the time.

09:41.474 --> 09:43.343
They never did anything.
Nothing?

09:43.376 --> 09:45.579
KANE: Oh, they'd drive by
now and then.

09:45.612 --> 09:47.080
They'd put up their
observation post

09:47.113 --> 09:48.148
with the little cameras.

09:48.181 --> 09:49.482
That's how they got that tape,

09:49.516 --> 09:51.618
but they never did do nothing.

09:51.652 --> 09:53.319
To get them to come
into our neighborhood,

09:53.353 --> 09:54.688
a gun has to go off.

09:54.721 --> 09:57.558
That sounds like
an exaggeration.

09:57.591 --> 09:59.560
KANE: An exaggeration?

09:59.593 --> 10:01.568
There's an ice-cream truck

10:01.602 --> 10:03.169
drives down our street,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.438
makes all the kids come running.

10:05.471 --> 10:06.773
They sell popsicles,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.842
fudgesicles,
and cocaine.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.277
The ice-cream truck!

10:11.311 --> 10:13.379
There are children
on our street,

10:13.413 --> 10:14.314
10 years old,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.783
not only using,
but dealing!

10:16.817 --> 10:18.552
Mr. Berluti,

10:18.585 --> 10:19.653
please step up.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.562
What is the relevance
of this testimony, Mr. Berluti?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.631
Goes to defendant's intent.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.733
Just trying to get
a clear picture, Judge.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.902
Do you enjoy practicing law,
counsel?

10:35.936 --> 10:39.105
You know, Judge,
you rebuking me

10:39.139 --> 10:40.340
in front of the jury

10:40.373 --> 10:42.442
doesn't make me look good.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.145
So I'm just gonna smile

10:45.178 --> 10:46.947
and make it look like
the two of us

10:46.980 --> 10:49.049
are having a good
laugh together.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.317
Would that be okay, Judge?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.820
I'm just smiling for effect.

10:53.854 --> 10:57.390
Please don't think
I consider you a funny guy.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.392
(chuckles)

10:59.425 --> 11:01.134
Can I continue now, Judge?

11:09.676 --> 11:10.877
(door opens)

11:10.911 --> 11:11.812
SHORE: Mr. Markham.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.148
It is selective prosecution,

11:15.181 --> 11:16.349
that's what this is.
You're right.

11:16.382 --> 11:19.085
But while the man who kissed
Halle continues to go free,

11:19.119 --> 11:20.687
why don't we sit in here
and go over your testimony?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.055
Excuse me.

11:22.088 --> 11:23.189
Hi.

11:23.223 --> 11:24.758
We have a problem.

11:26.092 --> 11:28.629
We can't expense
new clothes for clients.

11:28.662 --> 11:30.731
Uh, not in the budget.

11:30.764 --> 11:32.699
This is the top criminal firm
in Boston.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.701
Surely we can afford $200.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.770
WILSON: Uh, the top firm
that you speak of

11:36.803 --> 11:39.372
is Donnell, Young,
Dole, and Frutt.

11:39.405 --> 11:40.574
Donnell is gone.

11:40.607 --> 11:41.675
Dole is gone.

11:41.708 --> 11:43.309
Washington is gone.

11:44.410 --> 11:46.713
And we don't take
clients shopping.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.649
Do we take each
other shopping?

11:54.988 --> 11:56.957
I wasn't insane
when I fired that gun.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.458
I won't say I was.

11:58.491 --> 12:01.234
I shot that man because
he was killing our children,

12:01.267 --> 12:03.269
because he wouldn't stop
killing our children.

12:04.304 --> 12:05.706
Okay, look...

12:07.307 --> 12:08.975
at me, Aisha,

12:09.009 --> 12:10.243
right in the eyes.

12:12.579 --> 12:15.982
The judge has taken away
defense of others.

12:16.016 --> 12:17.150
You explained that.
YOUNG: Well, evidently,

12:17.183 --> 12:19.319
not well enough.

12:19.352 --> 12:20.554
If we don't claim insanity,

12:20.587 --> 12:22.823
we have no theory
by which to prevail.

12:22.856 --> 12:23.924
AISHA: Then I go to prison.

12:23.957 --> 12:26.860
I'd rather do that than
to pretend I'm crazy.

12:26.893 --> 12:28.328
You look me in the eye.

12:31.331 --> 12:32.766
I am not nuts.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.602
Drugs are killing our babies.

12:35.636 --> 12:37.771
Somebody has to protect
our babies.

12:37.804 --> 12:39.573
If the police refuse--
You cannot say that.

12:39.606 --> 12:40.741
AISHA: Yes, I can,

12:40.774 --> 12:42.809
and you can't stop me.
YOUNG: The judge will stop you!

12:42.843 --> 12:44.144
AISHA: I'm the client.

12:44.177 --> 12:48.515
I get to decide what
our legal strategy is, counsel.

12:48.549 --> 12:50.116
It won't be insanity.

12:55.556 --> 12:59.325
I do not want bail.
Why not?

12:59.359 --> 13:00.867
FRUTT:
Because if you get let out,

13:00.901 --> 13:03.103
there will be
a public outcry, Brad,

13:03.136 --> 13:06.072
and that outcry
could prejudice us at trial.

13:06.106 --> 13:07.641
I don't think you follow.

13:07.674 --> 13:09.943
If I'm allowed
to address the public,

13:09.976 --> 13:11.277
the outcry will be squashed.

13:11.311 --> 13:12.345
That's the point.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.881
I think you're overestimating
your charm a little.

13:15.949 --> 13:17.183
(door opens)

13:19.820 --> 13:20.654
Daddy!

13:20.687 --> 13:21.755
BRAD: Hey, baby!

13:21.788 --> 13:23.356
Oh, God,

13:23.389 --> 13:25.859
you're getting bigger
every day, young lady!

13:26.927 --> 13:27.728
Hey, Christine.

13:27.761 --> 13:28.795
Hello.

13:30.130 --> 13:31.164
Look at you.

13:31.197 --> 13:33.567
FRUTT: Ms. Shepherd,

13:33.600 --> 13:34.635
I was wondering
if I could talk to you

13:34.668 --> 13:35.702
for a few minutes?

13:36.703 --> 13:40.306
Your client murdered
my sister, Ms. Frutt.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.608
I won't be cooperating much

13:41.642 --> 13:42.776
with his defense.

13:46.613 --> 13:48.982
It was so gross.

13:49.015 --> 13:51.451
I, like, came around
the turn in the corridor,

13:51.484 --> 13:52.218
and he was there.

13:52.252 --> 13:53.386
The defendant?

13:53.419 --> 13:55.722
DEBBIE:
Yes. And next thing,

13:55.756 --> 13:58.925
he was like forcing
his scuzzy tongue

13:58.959 --> 14:00.266
into my mouth.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.535
BARRON:
And this occurred when?

14:01.568 --> 14:03.570
DEBBIE: At my place of work,
for God's sake!

14:03.604 --> 14:04.971
Everybody saw it.

14:05.005 --> 14:07.508
And the way he smelled--

14:07.541 --> 14:09.409
his smell was on me.

14:09.442 --> 14:11.111
It took three showers
to get it off.

14:11.144 --> 14:12.178
BARRON: Thank you, Debbie.

14:16.783 --> 14:19.285
Forgive me, I just want
to say for the record

14:19.319 --> 14:22.488
you are a very fetching
young lady.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.826
Do gentlemen hit
on you a lot?

14:25.859 --> 14:27.093
Some.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.462
SHORE: I can imagine.
At the office Christmas party,

14:29.495 --> 14:30.831
you ever been suddenly kissed

14:30.864 --> 14:32.498
while standing
underneath the mistletoe?

14:32.533 --> 14:33.667
By co-workers,

14:33.700 --> 14:35.268
not total strangers.

14:35.301 --> 14:37.003
You never filed
criminal charges

14:37.037 --> 14:37.971
in those instances?

14:38.004 --> 14:39.105
No.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.707
That was an honest
answer, Debbie.

14:40.741 --> 14:41.875
I appreciate that.

14:41.908 --> 14:43.009
Let me ask you this,

14:43.043 --> 14:46.446
if Brad Pitt suddenly
approached you,

14:46.479 --> 14:48.649
kissed you at the office,

14:48.682 --> 14:50.450
would you call
the police? Honestly.

14:50.483 --> 14:52.318
He's not Brad Pitt.

14:52.352 --> 14:54.354
SHORE: Yes, I see.

14:54.387 --> 14:56.189
So it's not so much
being kissed,

14:56.222 --> 14:57.991
but rather by whom.

14:58.024 --> 14:59.593
By what.

14:59.626 --> 15:03.069
SHORE: Thank you, Debbie.
That was refreshingly honest.

15:04.538 --> 15:05.539
By the way,

15:05.572 --> 15:07.007
if I were to--

15:09.576 --> 15:12.112
never mind, that's probably
not appropriate.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.080
You can step down,
young lady.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.052
SHORE: Okay.
Accept responsibility,

15:19.085 --> 15:20.253
show remorse,

15:20.286 --> 15:21.922
convey that you never
meant to harm

15:21.955 --> 15:23.456
or scare her, okay?

15:23.489 --> 15:24.390
Yeah.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.629
The defense calls
Randy Markham.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.697
Why?

15:30.731 --> 15:31.798
Why?

15:31.832 --> 15:33.033
If he did it,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.569
I don't have to hear why.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.003
It takes my time.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.805
I value my time, Mr. Shore.

15:38.839 --> 15:40.440
When it's wasted,
my hemorrhoids tend

15:40.473 --> 15:41.374
to bubble up.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.643
He's the defendant.

15:42.676 --> 15:43.677
In Massachusetts,

15:43.710 --> 15:46.146
I believe
the constitution trumps

15:46.179 --> 15:47.113
the bubbled hemorrhoid.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.081
I could be wrong.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.182
DICKEM: You know what?

15:49.215 --> 15:51.985
You're absolutely right.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.887
If your client chooses
to testify,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.389
that is his
constitutional right.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.125
It would certainly be
very inappropriate for me

15:59.159 --> 16:00.934
to deter the exercising

16:00.967 --> 16:04.137
of that precious entitlement.

16:05.171 --> 16:08.742
Would your client like
to testify, Mr. Shore?

16:11.912 --> 16:13.614
Why don't you have a seat.

16:17.551 --> 16:20.220
We wanted to talk to you
about your dad's trial,

16:20.253 --> 16:21.522
which starts next week.

16:21.555 --> 16:22.355
He told me.

16:22.388 --> 16:24.257
You want me to come.
FRUTT: Yes.

16:24.290 --> 16:26.426
We also were thinking
of calling you

16:26.459 --> 16:27.828
as a witness.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.762
Did your dad tell you that?

16:28.795 --> 16:30.496
Yes.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.499
You want me to say my mom
seemed really sad,

16:33.534 --> 16:36.570
so people will believe
she committed suicide.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.872
We just want you
to tell the truth.

16:38.905 --> 16:41.542
She seemed really sad.

16:41.575 --> 16:45.045
Do you think your mom
killed herself?

16:45.078 --> 16:46.980
I know my dad didn't kill her.

16:48.381 --> 16:49.550
He loved her.

16:51.117 --> 16:52.586
She seemed so sad,

16:52.619 --> 16:55.188
so I think she must
have committed suicide.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.391
Emma, did your dad

16:58.424 --> 17:00.233
ask you to say that?

17:00.266 --> 17:01.868
No.

17:04.436 --> 17:07.373
(engine revving)

17:13.847 --> 17:16.817
(dog barking)

17:16.849 --> 17:18.785
(Ashley laughs)

17:18.819 --> 17:21.755
(water splashing)

17:25.759 --> 17:26.560
RANDY:
Ah! Did you like that?

17:26.593 --> 17:27.594
ASHLEY: Yeah!

17:27.627 --> 17:29.029
Mr. Markham?

17:30.496 --> 17:34.367
Uh, so sorry to come here.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.637
Uh, my daughter, Ashley.
Say hello, baby.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.271
Hi.

17:38.304 --> 17:41.041
RANDY: She's never swam
in a pool before.

17:41.074 --> 17:42.709
I thought
while we were waiting--

17:44.845 --> 17:46.046
you have a daughter?

17:46.079 --> 17:47.480
Yeah.

17:48.815 --> 17:50.551
Does she live with you
on the street?

17:50.584 --> 17:52.819
Actually,
I'm not homeless.

17:52.853 --> 17:55.021
I'm living in a tenement
in a project.

17:55.055 --> 17:57.791
I try to give her
as normal a life as I can.

17:58.859 --> 18:00.634
(laughs)
What are you doing here?

18:00.667 --> 18:02.302
I got rolled.

18:02.335 --> 18:03.904
I'm sorry?

18:03.937 --> 18:05.071
RANDY: For my shoes.

18:05.105 --> 18:06.306
I got rolled for my shoes.

18:06.339 --> 18:08.308
I got nothing
for testimony tomorrow.

18:08.341 --> 18:10.844
Had your address,
and I just figured,

18:10.877 --> 18:11.712
you got me the suit.

18:11.745 --> 18:13.313
Without the shoes,
you know,

18:13.346 --> 18:14.247
the whole point.

18:15.982 --> 18:17.818
I'll bring you another pair
of shoes tomorrow.

18:23.724 --> 18:25.491
Can I ask you a question?

18:25.526 --> 18:26.693
You don't got to answer
if you don't want to.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.762
No, go ahead.

18:29.863 --> 18:32.365
The girl at court today
said I smell.

18:33.399 --> 18:34.568
Do I smell?

18:35.536 --> 18:37.571
At the moment,
only like chlorine.

18:37.604 --> 18:38.438
RANDY: Please.

18:39.706 --> 18:40.874
Be honest with me.

18:44.845 --> 18:47.313
You do have a distinctive
body odor.

18:50.617 --> 18:51.685
I do bathe.

18:53.687 --> 18:54.755
Maybe not as much,

18:56.657 --> 18:57.824
I do bathe.

18:57.858 --> 18:59.359
ASHLEY: Look at this, daddy!

19:03.003 --> 19:04.137
Hey, I'm really sorry.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.572
She's always dreamed
of swimming in a pool.

19:05.606 --> 19:07.307
I shouldn't have done this.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.474
No, it's okay.

19:10.777 --> 19:12.579
Swim as long as you like.

19:13.714 --> 19:16.850
And I'll see you tomorrow
in court.

19:16.883 --> 19:19.419
Thank you very much.

19:19.452 --> 19:22.388
(music playing)

19:34.500 --> 19:37.804
The observation posts
are a joke.

19:37.838 --> 19:39.773
Those drug deals
are captured on tape

19:39.806 --> 19:41.508
just as clearly
as what I did,

19:41.542 --> 19:44.310
but the police don't respond.

19:44.344 --> 19:47.113
I doubt they even look
at those tapes.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.082
Is crack a big problem

19:49.115 --> 19:50.584
in your neighborhood, Aisha?

19:50.617 --> 19:52.586
Is it a big problem?

19:52.619 --> 19:54.688
My two year-old daughter
was killed

19:54.721 --> 19:57.123
in a drive-by three years ago.

19:57.157 --> 19:59.325
I've seen my friends' children

19:59.359 --> 20:00.934
become dealers, addicts.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.971
My street has become
crack lane, Mr. Berluti.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.139
It's almost impossible

20:06.172 --> 20:08.141
for a child to grow up
in our neighborhood

20:08.174 --> 20:10.110
without it being shoved
in his face!

20:10.143 --> 20:12.245
There are drive-by shootings,

20:12.278 --> 20:13.479
random killings,

20:13.514 --> 20:14.915
intentional killings,

20:14.948 --> 20:17.050
and at the root of it all
are drugs.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.384
Cocaine, crack,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.353
all being dealt openly

20:20.386 --> 20:22.222
and notoriously
by Marcus Thayer

20:22.255 --> 20:24.625
and others,
and the police do nothing.

20:24.658 --> 20:25.959
Counsel.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.664
So, what happened that day?

20:30.697 --> 20:33.266
AISHA: What happened is...

20:33.299 --> 20:36.737
I decided to do something

20:36.770 --> 20:39.339
to save the kids
on our street.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.542
I decided to protect the lives

20:41.575 --> 20:44.077
that Marcus Thayer
was so intent on destroying.

20:44.110 --> 20:44.978
HARROD: Ms. Crenshaw,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.713
as I have advised your counsel,

20:46.747 --> 20:47.781
I will advise you.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.017
Defense of others
is not a justifiable theory--

20:51.051 --> 20:52.018
AISHA: It's justifiable
to the parents

20:52.052 --> 20:53.119
who live in our neighborhood.

20:53.153 --> 20:54.821
HARROD: Ms. Crenshaw,
I will instruct this jury

20:54.855 --> 20:56.389
not to accept self-defense

20:56.422 --> 20:57.423
or defense of others as--

20:57.457 --> 20:58.692
AISHA: Why don't you
instruct the mayor

20:58.725 --> 20:59.826
to instruct the police

20:59.860 --> 21:01.167
to clean up our streets?

21:01.201 --> 21:03.269
HARROD: You have the right
to present your testimony,

21:03.303 --> 21:04.638
but as you move forward--
AISHA: These dealers

21:04.671 --> 21:07.040
are arrested over and over,

21:07.073 --> 21:08.775
and never do time.
It has to stop.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.811
HARROD: I will tell this jury
in no uncertain terms

21:10.844 --> 21:12.879
that, as a matter of law,

21:12.913 --> 21:14.948
they cannot even consider
defense of others

21:14.981 --> 21:16.617
as an exculpatory theory.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.985
Do you understand that?

21:19.019 --> 21:20.521
CRENSHAW: I think so.

21:20.554 --> 21:21.955
As a matter of law,
the truth

21:21.988 --> 21:23.056
of what happened that day

21:23.089 --> 21:25.025
can't be considered
in this room.

21:26.993 --> 21:29.062
I will see counsel in chambers.

21:29.095 --> 21:32.032
(indistinct chatter)

21:36.369 --> 21:38.304
(door opens)

21:39.840 --> 21:41.842
I gave you a specific order.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.544
We passed that on
to our client.

21:43.577 --> 21:44.911
But as, Your Honor,
well knows,

21:44.945 --> 21:46.547
every criminal defendant

21:46.580 --> 21:47.914
has the right to take
the stand

21:47.948 --> 21:49.349
and tell his or her story.

21:49.382 --> 21:51.552
Our client chose to exercise
that right.

21:51.585 --> 21:53.887
HARROD: If you argue defense
of others in your closing,

21:53.920 --> 21:56.222
I will have both
of your bar cards.

21:56.256 --> 21:57.457
Do you understand me?

21:59.526 --> 22:01.367
Do you understand me, counsel?

22:03.403 --> 22:04.370
We understand.

22:08.474 --> 22:09.610
I just think we need

22:09.643 --> 22:11.978
an alternative version
to suicide.

22:13.079 --> 22:14.515
The idea that she killed herself

22:14.548 --> 22:15.516
with cyanide--

22:18.184 --> 22:20.721
look,
I assembled a mock jury.

22:20.754 --> 22:23.123
I presented
the defense side only,

22:23.156 --> 22:25.592
none of the prosecution's
evidence,

22:25.626 --> 22:27.260
and still...

22:27.293 --> 22:29.462
none of them
would swallow suicide.

22:29.495 --> 22:31.231
What do you mean
a mock jury?

22:31.264 --> 22:33.099
I wanted to test our defense

22:33.133 --> 22:37.170
because I am very
nervous about it.

22:37.203 --> 22:39.139
And as I said,
I only gave them

22:39.172 --> 22:40.841
our version and still--
No, you didn't give them

22:40.874 --> 22:43.243
our version, Ellenor.

22:43.276 --> 22:45.646
I am the defense version.

22:45.679 --> 22:47.748
Your little mock jury
didn't hear from me.

22:47.781 --> 22:49.449
Brad--
My wife

22:49.482 --> 22:50.951
was a very bad woman.

22:51.852 --> 22:53.654
She had an affair.

22:53.687 --> 22:54.721
She wanted to leave me, Ellenor,

22:54.755 --> 22:56.723
destroy our family.

22:56.757 --> 22:58.191
I'm sure she was racked
with guilt over that,

22:58.224 --> 22:59.159
don't you?

23:01.367 --> 23:02.836
Ask Emma.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.839
Molly seemed very sad.

23:07.708 --> 23:09.810
She committed suicide.

23:15.281 --> 23:16.717
You kissed her

23:16.750 --> 23:17.951
as she described?

23:17.984 --> 23:19.986
Well, I didn't totally
surprise her.

23:21.822 --> 23:23.690
I gave her a chance
to see me coming.

23:23.724 --> 23:25.258
I wanted her to see me first.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.593
SHORE: Why is that?

23:26.627 --> 23:27.528
Because I wanted her to know

23:27.561 --> 23:29.129
who was kissing her.

23:29.162 --> 23:30.697
SHORE: Can you tell us why?

23:30.731 --> 23:31.798
RANDY: Well, the day before,

23:31.832 --> 23:33.567
I'm sitting on Columbus.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.102
I had my little girl with me,

23:36.136 --> 23:37.804
six years old.
What were you doing

23:37.838 --> 23:39.305
on Columbus street?

23:39.339 --> 23:40.273
RANDY: Begging,

23:40.306 --> 23:42.108
soliciting for money.

23:42.142 --> 23:44.611
I work here and there
where I can,

23:44.645 --> 23:47.280
but when I don't have
enough money for food,

23:47.313 --> 23:49.315
I'm not above asking people
for help.

23:49.349 --> 23:51.051
That's what I was doing
this day...

23:52.118 --> 23:54.254
and she walks by.
SHORE: "She" being?

23:54.287 --> 23:56.422
RANDY:
The girl I went on to kiss.

23:56.456 --> 23:57.658
She walks by,

23:57.691 --> 23:59.159
I asked for help,

23:59.192 --> 24:01.267
and she made a remark about...

24:01.301 --> 24:02.669
me being disgusting,

24:02.703 --> 24:04.270
about me smelling.

24:04.304 --> 24:05.706
You said that...

24:05.739 --> 24:06.840
right in front of my daughter,

24:06.873 --> 24:08.575
and then you...

24:08.609 --> 24:10.343
mumbled some other things

24:10.376 --> 24:11.578
as you walked away,

24:13.680 --> 24:15.048
things that I won't repeat,

24:16.750 --> 24:18.018
but my daughter heard it.

24:21.154 --> 24:22.388
Then what happened?

24:22.422 --> 24:24.290
I watched her walk
into the building.

24:27.293 --> 24:28.394
And I turned to my baby,

24:28.428 --> 24:29.495
and she was crying.

24:30.363 --> 24:32.566
Why was she crying?

24:32.599 --> 24:33.934
Because of what she heard.

24:36.603 --> 24:38.404
I haven't been able to give
my daughter much,

24:41.274 --> 24:43.544
but I did give her the right
to respect her dad,

24:45.646 --> 24:47.814
and maybe even
on the odd day, admire.

24:51.217 --> 24:52.653
You took that from her.

24:54.855 --> 24:55.822
SHORE: Mr. Markham,

24:57.891 --> 24:59.459
why kiss this woman?

24:59.492 --> 25:01.802
Because I wanted
to embarrass her the way

25:01.835 --> 25:02.936
that she embarrassed me.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.472
I walked my...

25:07.641 --> 25:09.910
smelly ass into her office.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.245
I walked my disgusting self
right up to her,

25:12.278 --> 25:14.247
and I kissed her
to humiliate her

25:15.616 --> 25:17.984
to make you feel
the way I felt.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.823
The way I still feel.

25:25.091 --> 25:28.161
Sitting in a courtroom,
listening to you...

25:28.194 --> 25:29.830
tell this judge and everybody

25:29.863 --> 25:31.064
that it...

25:31.097 --> 25:32.699
took you three showers

25:34.134 --> 25:36.369
to get the smell off of you!

25:36.402 --> 25:39.339
(banging)

25:45.445 --> 25:46.880
Murder two?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.849
YOUNG: It allows
for the possibility of parole.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.451
We think you should take it.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.019
What would my sentence be?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.123
Life. But, again,

25:57.157 --> 25:58.224
with murder one--
Forget it.

25:58.258 --> 25:59.425
YOUNG: Aisha--
I said, forget it.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.735
I heard what you said,

26:01.768 --> 26:03.103
but listen to me, please.

26:04.971 --> 26:07.040
We have nothing.

26:07.073 --> 26:09.442
Our only hope,
if you can even call it a hope,

26:09.475 --> 26:12.012
is for a hung verdict.
Our only chance to get that

26:12.045 --> 26:14.447
is to convince a juror to say
"The hell with the law."

26:14.480 --> 26:16.282
CRENSHAW: Good,
get one to say that.

26:16.316 --> 26:18.852
If they come back guilty,
which...

26:18.885 --> 26:20.721
truthfully,
how could they not,

26:20.754 --> 26:23.690
you get life, no parole.

26:23.724 --> 26:25.158
YOUNG: There's no point
in being a martyr.

26:28.829 --> 26:30.296
I know you care.

26:31.732 --> 26:34.367
You care because we're all
on the same side.

26:35.268 --> 26:37.003
The problem is
with too many voices,

26:37.037 --> 26:39.005
you get noise.

26:39.039 --> 26:41.542
So let's speak with one voice.

26:41.575 --> 26:43.409
And since I'm the client,

26:43.443 --> 26:47.047
since I'm the one who's gonna be
sitting in that prison cell,

26:47.080 --> 26:48.749
let's let the voice be mine.

26:54.420 --> 26:55.656
Jimmy...

26:55.689 --> 26:58.759
I want you to look those jurors
in the eye

26:58.792 --> 27:00.634
and tell them...

27:00.667 --> 27:03.604
that the law is wrong.

27:03.637 --> 27:05.672
Marcus Thayer had it coming.

27:06.607 --> 27:08.942
The law is wrong.

27:13.113 --> 27:15.048
(elevator bell dings)

27:16.650 --> 27:17.784
Debbie, hello.

27:17.818 --> 27:19.385
You're dishonest, you know,

27:19.419 --> 27:21.655
dressing him up like that
in a suit.

27:21.688 --> 27:23.824
That is not what accosted me,
and you know it.

27:23.857 --> 27:26.827
SHORE: Debbie, this case
was assigned to me.

27:26.860 --> 27:27.994
Certainly, you know that.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.665
Do you think I like defending

27:31.698 --> 27:32.799
these kinds of people?

27:32.833 --> 27:36.369
You know, this isn't technically
relevant to the case,

27:37.170 --> 27:39.940
but I touched myself
with you in mind last night.

27:42.308 --> 27:43.577
Your hair was...

27:44.545 --> 27:45.746
very different,

27:45.779 --> 27:46.980
but anyway.

27:47.681 --> 27:49.082
Just between you and me,

27:49.115 --> 27:51.752
it turns out Mr. Markham

27:51.785 --> 27:54.354
has a homeowners
insurance policy.

27:54.387 --> 27:56.422
Cheap, but not totally
worthless.

27:56.456 --> 27:58.291
If you were to say,

27:58.324 --> 27:59.893
sue him civilly,

27:59.926 --> 28:02.402
you might get, say $10,000.

28:03.003 --> 28:04.004
I would?

28:04.037 --> 28:06.907
The policy covers defamation
of character.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.976
For you to allege
his kissing you defamed you.

28:10.010 --> 28:12.646
Perhaps people thought
you were a couple--

28:13.747 --> 28:15.181
the claim would be colorable

28:15.215 --> 28:16.783
with the assistance
of a good attorney,

28:16.817 --> 28:19.119
which I am.

28:19.152 --> 28:21.655
Of course, I would need you
to drop the criminal complaint.

28:21.688 --> 28:22.723
We'd wanna...

28:22.756 --> 28:24.858
throw Randy a bone,
wouldn't we?

28:25.992 --> 28:28.194
I bet you could use $10,000.

28:29.462 --> 28:31.364
Think of the shopping, Debbie.

28:33.534 --> 28:34.968
Isn't that,
like, an illegal bribe?

28:35.001 --> 28:36.803
SHORE: Which means...

28:36.837 --> 28:38.939
this would have to be
our little secret.

28:46.847 --> 28:48.181
YOUNG: It's all
in the wording, Jimmy.

28:48.214 --> 28:50.283
If you word it right,
he can't shut you down.

28:50.316 --> 28:51.317
But if you're not disciplined

28:51.351 --> 28:53.453
with every word--
Okay.

28:53.486 --> 28:55.455
All we need is one juror, Jimmy.

28:55.488 --> 28:56.923
One juror buys us a hung jury.

28:56.957 --> 28:58.491
With that, we get a new trial,

28:58.525 --> 29:00.026
and that's all we can hope for
at this point.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.402
And what if he does
shut me down?

29:02.435 --> 29:04.237
Well, if you word it right,

29:04.270 --> 29:06.106
he can't without handing us
a new trial.

29:06.139 --> 29:08.474
And if he does that...

29:08.509 --> 29:09.275
great.

29:14.681 --> 29:15.516
Hello.

29:15.549 --> 29:17.518
What's this embezzling thing?

29:17.551 --> 29:19.019
Thank you for asking.

29:19.052 --> 29:20.086
It was sort of a...

29:20.120 --> 29:21.855
half-Robin Hood kind of thing.

29:21.888 --> 29:23.423
I took from the rich.

29:24.625 --> 29:25.892
And who'd you give to?

29:25.926 --> 29:27.393
I kept it.

29:27.427 --> 29:28.895
Thus, the "Half-Robin Hood."

29:29.996 --> 29:31.832
I've disappointed you.

29:31.865 --> 29:33.734
What's this about bringing
a hooker

29:33.767 --> 29:35.268
to a client's wedding?

29:35.301 --> 29:37.370
The invitation said
"Significant other."

29:37.403 --> 29:40.874
I assure you,
she was extremely significant.

29:51.017 --> 29:53.186
It doesn't even matter

29:53.219 --> 29:55.188
whether the judge allows cameras

29:55.221 --> 29:56.823
in the courtroom or not.

29:56.857 --> 29:59.626
You're already in that room.

29:59.660 --> 30:02.268
More importantly,
and alarmingly,

30:02.302 --> 30:04.237
you're in the jury room.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.740
Every article being written

30:06.773 --> 30:08.174
about Brad Stanfield

30:08.208 --> 30:10.844
presupposes his guilt.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.579
He's the horrible husband

30:12.613 --> 30:14.781
who murdered his pregnant wife.

30:14.815 --> 30:16.016
Amazing...

30:16.049 --> 30:18.118
that you can all know that

30:18.151 --> 30:20.754
without being privy
to the facts.

30:20.787 --> 30:24.525
The prosecution has guarded
this case tightly.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.159
We don't even know
the evidence.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.828
And yet, with the media,

30:27.861 --> 30:31.331
the world, and possibly
the potential jury pool,

30:31.364 --> 30:34.167
he already stands guilty.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.369
Get this,

30:36.402 --> 30:39.606
Molly Stanfield
took her own life.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.475
And when the facts finally

30:42.509 --> 30:46.012
and appropriately come out
in trial,

30:46.046 --> 30:48.181
you will all know

30:48.214 --> 30:50.183
what I know now.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.753
My client is innocent.

30:52.786 --> 30:53.920
Ms. Frutt!

30:53.954 --> 30:56.890
(indistinct chatter)

31:02.102 --> 31:03.469
Okay.

31:03.504 --> 31:05.338
Hmm, Chanel.

31:05.371 --> 31:07.173
We can make this very simple.

31:07.207 --> 31:09.442
Randy will agree
not to contest the claim,

31:09.475 --> 31:11.477
which he has to do
as the policy holder.

31:11.512 --> 31:12.879
He'll also waive the conflict,

31:12.913 --> 31:14.581
so I can help you, Deborah.

31:14.615 --> 31:16.917
You agree to drop
the criminal complaint,

31:16.950 --> 31:19.553
and we all agree
to keep this agreement

31:19.586 --> 31:21.822
completely private.

31:21.855 --> 31:24.124
And what if the insurance
won't pay?

31:24.157 --> 31:25.859
They will.
It's a lot less

31:25.892 --> 31:27.127
than the cost of litigation.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.629
I also know the claims adjuster.

31:28.662 --> 31:29.596
He's a friend,

31:29.630 --> 31:30.831
a giver,

31:30.864 --> 31:32.365
corrupt.

31:33.667 --> 31:36.737
The only thing left then
would be the apology.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.005
We would like it to be both oral

31:39.039 --> 31:40.073
and written.

31:43.977 --> 31:45.646
Wait, you want me to apologize?

31:45.679 --> 31:48.448
In person now and in writing

31:48.481 --> 31:50.851
so his daughter can read it
when she's older.

31:54.487 --> 31:56.923
Why would I ever apologize
to him?

32:01.367 --> 32:04.104
Because you offended
his dignity, Debbie.

32:04.137 --> 32:05.739
You were disrespectful

32:05.772 --> 32:08.108
to an honorable man
and his daughter.

32:09.075 --> 32:10.544
You demeaned his character.

32:12.178 --> 32:13.680
What you did was wrong.

32:20.253 --> 32:21.855
Those are the conditions,

32:21.888 --> 32:22.923
non-negotiable.

32:28.494 --> 32:30.330
I believe...

32:30.363 --> 32:31.598
quite strongly...

32:31.632 --> 32:33.233
in law and order.

32:33.266 --> 32:36.069
We are a nation of laws.

32:36.102 --> 32:38.071
And it would be wrong for me

32:38.104 --> 32:39.673
or any lawyer to say,

32:39.706 --> 32:42.108
"It's okay for one person

32:42.142 --> 32:44.177
to take the law
into her own hands."

32:44.210 --> 32:46.112
So I won't argue that.

32:46.146 --> 32:47.714
Even if children

32:47.748 --> 32:49.482
were dying in front of her,

32:49.516 --> 32:51.652
as was the case with my client.

32:51.685 --> 32:55.355
Even if she had to witness
teenage drug addiction,

32:55.388 --> 32:56.723
gunfire,

32:56.757 --> 33:00.166
sometimes the killing
of innocent people

33:00.200 --> 33:02.468
such as her own
two year-old daughter.

33:02.969 --> 33:04.905
As I said,
it would be wrong for me

33:04.938 --> 33:06.740
as an officer of the court

33:06.773 --> 33:09.342
to argue that she be allowed

33:09.375 --> 33:11.945
to take the law
into her own hands.

33:11.978 --> 33:13.647
So I won't argue that.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.616
I won't argue self-defense

33:15.649 --> 33:18.084
or defense of others,

33:18.118 --> 33:19.886
but you all heard

33:19.920 --> 33:21.287
what was in her mind.

33:21.321 --> 33:23.423
It is within...

33:23.456 --> 33:25.125
the power of this jury

33:25.158 --> 33:27.093
to vote your conscience,

33:27.127 --> 33:29.195
and I would implore you

33:29.229 --> 33:32.132
to dig into
your conscience today.

33:32.165 --> 33:33.233
Mr. Berluti.

33:33.266 --> 33:35.736
BERLUTI:
Martin Luther King Jr. said,

33:35.769 --> 33:38.204
"When confronted
with an unjust law,

33:38.238 --> 33:40.907
the moral and ethical
thing to do

33:40.941 --> 33:42.408
is to break that law."

33:42.442 --> 33:44.144
He said that.

33:44.177 --> 33:46.079
It would be wrong for me
to say it.

33:46.112 --> 33:47.280
Counsel.

33:47.313 --> 33:48.982
My client had no right

33:49.015 --> 33:51.417
to take the law
into her own hands,

33:51.451 --> 33:53.286
of course not.

33:53.319 --> 33:55.321
It is totally irrelevant

33:55.355 --> 33:58.091
that the police weren't
protecting her neighborhood,

33:58.124 --> 34:00.060
also irrelevant...

34:00.093 --> 34:02.969
that the conviction rate
for drug arrests in Boston

34:03.003 --> 34:04.905
is below 10%.

34:04.938 --> 34:07.574
Below 10%.

34:07.608 --> 34:10.010
Put that out of your minds.

34:10.043 --> 34:11.777
Drug use is going up,

34:11.812 --> 34:14.681
while drug arrests
are going down.

34:14.715 --> 34:17.518
It's out of control,

34:17.551 --> 34:20.286
but it has no relevance here.

34:20.320 --> 34:24.558
What are we as parents
supposed to do?

34:25.926 --> 34:27.661
That's a rhetorical question,
of course.

34:27.694 --> 34:30.130
It's not an issue for today.

34:30.163 --> 34:31.164
Mr. Berluti.

34:31.197 --> 34:33.734
BERLUTI: As a matter of law,

34:33.766 --> 34:35.802
Aisha Crenshaw should've waited

34:35.835 --> 34:37.103
for the police to respond,

34:37.137 --> 34:39.773
even though they weren't
responding.

34:39.806 --> 34:41.306
She should've let the children

34:41.341 --> 34:44.244
become drug addicts
or drug dealers.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.780
She should have let them
continue to die.

34:47.380 --> 34:51.083
She should have done nothing
and let all this happen,

34:51.117 --> 34:53.053
because, after all,

34:53.085 --> 34:56.222
we are a nation of laws.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.513
The law Mr. Berluti
suggests you defy

35:13.714 --> 35:14.948
is the one against murder,

35:16.717 --> 35:19.653
and what he's asking you
to embrace

35:19.686 --> 35:21.021
is terrorism.

35:21.522 --> 35:22.656
The defendant decided

35:22.689 --> 35:24.257
someone was not worthy of life,

35:24.290 --> 35:26.993
and so she acted to execute him,

35:27.027 --> 35:29.530
and her lawyer now stands
before you

35:29.563 --> 35:32.699
mocking our allegiance
to law and order.

35:32.733 --> 35:34.601
There are many countries
in the world

35:34.635 --> 35:36.436
who tolerate street justice.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.539
You don't like somebody,
you just shoot him.

35:39.439 --> 35:41.708
There are places
where this happens,

35:43.009 --> 35:44.545
but this is America.

35:44.578 --> 35:47.413
We don't permit vigilantism.

35:47.447 --> 35:48.982
We don't tolerate murder

35:49.015 --> 35:50.350
when the killer sees fit,

35:50.383 --> 35:53.887
no matter what his
or her conscience,

35:53.920 --> 35:57.791
and we certainly
don't embrace terrorism.

35:59.192 --> 36:01.267
My heart goes out
to Ms. Crenshaw

36:01.301 --> 36:03.570
for the loss of her child.

36:03.604 --> 36:06.006
Could the police do
a better job?

36:06.039 --> 36:07.674
Perhaps.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.109
If they had the resources,

36:09.142 --> 36:10.276
I'm sure they would.

36:12.012 --> 36:13.680
But what's the answer

36:13.714 --> 36:16.783
for citizens to pull out guns
and shoot the bad guys?

36:16.817 --> 36:19.753
Is that the country
we want to live in?

36:19.786 --> 36:21.321
Is it?

36:22.422 --> 36:24.090
I, too, believe...

36:24.124 --> 36:27.561
a jury should reflect
the conscience of America.

36:36.770 --> 36:39.840
That is not in my conscience.

36:39.873 --> 36:41.508
And I pray to God...

36:43.209 --> 36:44.611
for all our children,

36:46.379 --> 36:48.114
it's not in yours.

37:04.971 --> 37:05.772
Hi.

37:06.573 --> 37:07.674
Hi.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.676
It's just too phallic.

37:09.709 --> 37:11.711
Do you mind?

37:12.612 --> 37:14.648
You know, I've heard of this
faux flirtatiousness

37:14.681 --> 37:16.215
being used to cover
the real thing.

37:16.249 --> 37:17.383
Are you attracted to me?

37:17.416 --> 37:19.953
Are you looking for a slap?

37:19.986 --> 37:20.787
SHORE: Tara,

37:20.821 --> 37:23.957
rather rough trade
for a secretary.

37:23.990 --> 37:26.226
I'm a third-year law student
and a paralegal,

37:26.259 --> 37:27.227
not a secretary.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.329
This agreement
that you had me type up,

37:29.362 --> 37:30.697
tantamount to insurance fraud.

37:32.566 --> 37:33.867
Is that wrong?

37:35.902 --> 37:37.303
A little advice.

37:37.337 --> 37:40.073
You might mock the law
and get away with it,

37:40.106 --> 37:42.375
but don't make sport of me.

37:42.408 --> 37:44.344
Are we clear,

37:44.377 --> 37:45.311
Al?

37:47.480 --> 37:49.583
So, you are attracted to me.

37:53.854 --> 37:54.855
Mr. Markham.

37:54.888 --> 37:56.790
RANDY: I don't want to take up
much of your time.

38:00.534 --> 38:03.169
I'm not a good talker, but...

38:03.203 --> 38:04.705
in my life...

38:06.172 --> 38:08.575
I never had anybody...

38:08.609 --> 38:10.677
recognize me
as a person of dignity.

38:12.145 --> 38:14.014
Nobody ever...

38:14.047 --> 38:15.816
called me honorable before.

38:18.084 --> 38:21.021
And in keeping with the...

38:21.054 --> 38:23.890
character you accused me
of having,

38:28.094 --> 38:30.731
(sighs) thank you...

38:32.332 --> 38:33.499
Mr. Shore.

38:36.102 --> 38:39.072
(music playing)

38:48.048 --> 38:49.650
You think you're clever,
counsel.

38:49.683 --> 38:51.484
You think that closing
was clever.

38:51.518 --> 38:52.553
Hey, Judge,

38:52.586 --> 38:54.320
if you think
I crossed a line,

38:54.354 --> 38:55.789
call a mistrial.

38:55.822 --> 38:56.857
In fact, you might have

38:56.890 --> 38:57.758
a duty to--
You'd like that,

38:57.791 --> 38:58.925
wouldn't you,

38:58.959 --> 39:00.366
get a new trial?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.002
Is that what's going on,
you want a mistrial?

39:02.035 --> 39:04.404
I'm just interested in us
all doing the right thing.

39:04.437 --> 39:06.172
Now, you listen to me, you--
Hey,

39:06.206 --> 39:08.441
you told me
what I couldn't argue.

39:08.474 --> 39:12.012
I stood up there
and expressly didn't argue it.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.446
You got any problem
with me now,

39:13.479 --> 39:14.648
then it must be personal.

39:14.681 --> 39:17.050
I take my courtroom
very personal,

39:17.083 --> 39:18.552
and if--
If I crossed the line,

39:18.585 --> 39:19.853
call a mistrial.

39:19.886 --> 39:20.987
All right.

39:21.021 --> 39:21.855
(knock on door)

39:23.557 --> 39:24.591
Jury is back.

39:26.860 --> 39:29.796
(music playing)

39:38.972 --> 39:39.973
Mr. Foreman,

39:41.241 --> 39:42.643
am I to understand
you have reached

39:42.676 --> 39:44.477
a unanimous verdict
in 20 minutes?

39:44.511 --> 39:45.746
Yes, Your Honor.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.815
(indistinct chatter)

39:50.250 --> 39:51.652
Okay.

39:51.685 --> 39:52.786
What say you?

39:52.819 --> 39:54.921
On the matter
of the Commonwealth

39:54.955 --> 39:56.389
versus Aisha Crenshaw

39:56.422 --> 40:00.133
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

40:00.166 --> 40:03.103
we find the defendant,
Aisha Crenshaw

40:04.470 --> 40:05.606
not guilty.

40:09.743 --> 40:11.377
Not guilty,

40:11.411 --> 40:12.846
as in straight not guilty?

40:21.354 --> 40:23.389
Obviously,
there is no accounting for it.

40:23.423 --> 40:25.225
This jury simply made
a decision

40:25.258 --> 40:27.327
to let a guilty person go free.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.295
Clearly,
Mr. Berluti's endorsement

40:29.329 --> 40:31.197
of civil disobedience
registered.

40:31.231 --> 40:33.900
Not my version
of justice, Paul.

40:33.934 --> 40:35.268
I'm being informed Ms. Crenshaw

40:35.301 --> 40:36.737
is about to make a statement.

40:37.938 --> 40:39.906
AISHA: Am I surprised?

40:39.940 --> 40:41.341
Yes.

40:41.374 --> 40:43.910
But I'm also heartened.

40:43.944 --> 40:45.311
The jury sent a message

40:45.345 --> 40:48.081
not just to me or the police,

40:48.114 --> 40:49.415
but to all of us.

40:50.050 --> 40:52.853
We need to take back
our streets.

40:52.886 --> 40:55.388
The Second Amendment gives us
the right to bear arms

40:55.421 --> 40:57.658
to defend our homes,
our streets.

40:57.691 --> 41:01.234
It's time that the good people
start exercising that right

41:01.267 --> 41:03.003
to defend our children.

41:03.737 --> 41:05.506
We the people...

41:05.539 --> 41:07.207
need to rise up.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.076
We need to put
these dealers down

41:10.110 --> 41:13.013
before they take any more
of our children,

41:13.046 --> 41:14.314
and it's not just in Boston.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.583
All over,
you hear about tax cuts.

41:16.617 --> 41:19.385
Well, it's service cuts.

41:19.419 --> 41:22.355
And it's the poor neighborhoods
suffering these service cuts

41:22.388 --> 41:23.990
across this country.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.761
We need to rise up
and do a job.

41:27.794 --> 41:28.494
MAN: Mr. Young!

41:28.529 --> 41:31.064
(indistinct chatter)

41:31.097 --> 41:32.398
WOMAN: Mr. Berluti,
do you have a comment

41:32.432 --> 41:34.334
about she just said?

41:34.367 --> 41:36.336
(indistinct chatter)

41:36.369 --> 41:38.705
(music playing)

42:27.694 --> 42:30.664
(music playing)

42:54.120 --> 42:55.155
WOMAN: You Stinker!

42:55.188 --> 42:58.158
(music playing)
