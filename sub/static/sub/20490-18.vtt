WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:06.006
Well, this is a hell of a
way to spend a friday afternoon,

00:06.406 --> 00:09.609
searching
for a mutant firestarter
from ten thousand feet.

00:09.644 --> 00:11.211
Well, we got our best
shot from up here, brennan.

00:11.611 --> 00:13.213
Soon as our system picks up
the specific heat signature of

00:13.613 --> 00:15.215
his burn we can
be on him in a flash.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.816
Well, whoever he is, he's sick.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.783
He needs some serious therapy.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.621
The only therapy i'd give
him is my hands around his neck.

00:21.656 --> 00:23.623
Let's just get him
a job at a barbecue joint.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.426
Well, three people
have already died because
of the fires he's set.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.993
You know, shalimar's right.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
If this is what this
guy's going to do with his gift

00:30.065 --> 00:31.631
then he has to be stopped.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

01:10.470 --> 01:12.072
Command dispatch. Copy.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.039
Yeah, it's ray larkin.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.441
I think i got a fix
on the west side fires bug.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.878
Hold your position. Police and
fire backup are being notified.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.045
Code 2.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.281
No, i can't do it. I'm going in.

01:21.316 --> 01:22.482
Ray, i don't think...

01:22.882 --> 01:24.484
don't worry. I got
an angel on my shoulder.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.252
Oh, we got a hot spot.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.888
Third fire in two days.
This guy doesn't sleep.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.707
What's the heading?

01:30.742 --> 01:32.492
1475. it's midtown.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.100
Hey!

01:56.116 --> 01:57.917
Someone's still in there.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.719
You don't have to go, shal.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.323
Yeah, but i can't
help from out here.

02:03.358 --> 02:04.889
Tell you what.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.926
We flush him
out, he's all yours.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.741
Get out of here,
it's gonna blow!

02:27.747 --> 02:29.148
Aghh!

02:29.183 --> 02:30.515
Aghhh!

02:30.550 --> 02:34.954
Brennan! Jesse!

02:42.162 --> 02:44.929
Emma!

02:44.964 --> 02:46.566
We have to get him out of here!

02:46.966 --> 02:50.570
Jess, make us a way out!

03:01.381 --> 03:06.186
All right, yeah.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.405
Oh, man, he's been hit bad.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.006
I have to stop him.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.608
I have to stop... i have to...

03:29.008 --> 03:31.811
shhh. It's okay.
We're going to find him.

03:31.846 --> 03:37.382
It's okay. Let me help the pain.

03:37.417 --> 03:43.423
<panting> my wife. When
i left this morning i didn't...

03:43.823 --> 03:49.028
i didn't kiss her good bye.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.262
Emma.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.465
Emma.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.836
Emma. Emma.

04:31.871 --> 04:35.039
Hey, what happened?

04:35.074 --> 04:38.278
I think i died with him.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.694
I am adam kane.

04:55.094 --> 04:58.097
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

04:58.132 --> 05:01.065
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

05:01.100 --> 05:06.706
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.108
They developed
super-human abilities.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.303
Together with four
of the most powerful

05:38.338 --> 05:40.740
i fight to protect a world that
doesn't even know we exist.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.346
We are... mutant x.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.752
Home, sweet home.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.389
Let's check in with adam,
see if he's got any info from

05:56.424 --> 05:58.791
the fire department,
what happened back there.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.969
Hey, you okay?

06:12.004 --> 06:13.806
No. I should've been
more help back there.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.608
Shal, you did everything
that you could.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.575
Well, it wasn't good enough.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.413
I mean, i can walk into
a fight with twelve killers

06:20.448 --> 06:22.014
and not bat an eye.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.216
But fire?

06:23.616 --> 06:25.183
It's just that i got there,

06:25.218 --> 06:28.020
and the flames blazing
out the windows, and the smoke.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.823
And i could feel the heat from
the other side of the street.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.226
And i just lost control.

06:33.261 --> 06:35.228
I was just like...

06:35.628 --> 06:38.396
my head shut down and
i was just running on fear.

06:38.431 --> 06:41.634
An out of control fire is
a killer, and the one that that

06:41.669 --> 06:44.437
bastard set could've
taken us all out.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.404
Now you were the only smart one.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.642
Civilians had no
right walking into a fire.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.244
You okay, emma?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.011
That was a class b fire,
well into the open flame stage.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.449
There
was nothing anybody could've
done and nobody should've

06:56.484 --> 06:58.851
been in there, except
for fire professionals.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.219
Do you understand that?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.256
Okay, do you want
to listen to yourself?

07:03.291 --> 07:05.258
Because you're
starting to scare me.

07:05.293 --> 07:06.824
What?

07:06.859 --> 07:12.865
Look, i'm fine.
I just... i'm sorry.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.869
The fire marshall's report
has just come in and this fire

07:17.270 --> 07:18.836
was just like the others.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.274
There's no traces of accelerant,
no tampering with wires and

07:21.309 --> 07:23.641
extreme temperatures
at the fire's origin.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.278
Yeah, well, i'm starting
to think you were right.

07:25.313 --> 07:26.879
We're looking
at a mutant firestarter.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.846
Who has now killed four people.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.284
Yeah. Well, the
guy we tried to save was
a lead arson investigator.

07:31.319 --> 07:32.850
His name's ray larkin.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.653
Poor guy's a third
generation firefighter.

07:35.688 --> 07:39.257
He's married. No kids,
but must've been well-liked.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.294
They've
already posted a memorial
obituary on the website.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.296
Now wait, if this guy
was the lead fire investigator

07:43.696 --> 07:45.263
and he was in that building,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.300
then he just must've been
a few steps behind the arsonist.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.503
Yeah. Unfortunately that
doesn't help us very much.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.106
Sure didn't help
him either, did it?

07:59.712 --> 08:02.079
You okay?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.517
After what happened back there.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.083
What do you mean?

08:06.118 --> 08:07.685
Well, that guy,
dying in your arms.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.923
I thought maybe you'd
be kind of out of it.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.527
I'm fine.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.535
I saw his whole
life right along with him.

08:22.570 --> 08:29.307
His friends,
his family, his wife.

08:29.342 --> 08:36.148
And then the strangest
sensations, like the taste of

08:36.183 --> 08:41.354
chocolate and the
smell of his wife's hair.

08:41.389 --> 08:43.721
That's intense.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.924
It's wild how
fast it can all be gone.

08:46.959 --> 08:52.164
We have to catch the guy
starting these fires, brennan.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.131
Yeah, and we're going to.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.168
There's gotta be a pattern
to how he chooses his burns.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.936
It means something to him.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.973
Well, maybe you should
get a little rest, huh?

09:01.008 --> 09:03.393
What happened
today was hard on you.

09:03.428 --> 09:05.778
No, i'll rest
when we catch this guy.

09:24.997 --> 09:28.601
I'll say this for you,
you don't give up easy.

09:28.636 --> 09:32.169
I don't give up, period.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.206
Shalimar, you're
making yourself crazy.

09:34.607 --> 09:38.811
Fear of fire
is primal for ferals.

09:38.846 --> 09:43.015
Thanks for your
vote of confidence.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.435
That's not what i'm saying.

09:45.470 --> 09:47.646
You've got nothing to prove.

09:47.681 --> 09:49.822
I can't let my fear conquer me.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.990
I can get over this.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.428
You're the bravest
person i know.

09:55.828 --> 10:00.633
But maybe you should just accept
your weakness and move on.

10:00.668 --> 10:05.838
Sorry. I'm not ready
to do that just yet.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.449
I think we should
go talk to ray's wife.

10:16.484 --> 10:19.452
I think the last
thing she'd want right now

10:19.487 --> 10:21.018
is people asking her questions.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.655
You don't think
i know how she's feeling?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.221
Now hold on, emma.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.223
What would we get
from going to see his widow?

10:26.258 --> 10:27.860
We've already accessed
all the files in his office.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.462
Yeah, but he has files at home.

10:29.497 --> 10:31.464
How do you know that?

10:31.864 --> 10:33.866
Because it's... it's
what people like that do.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.685
It's what i'd do.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.435
I'm not convinced.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.673
What if he talked to his
wife about the investigation?

10:40.708 --> 10:44.494
Okay, how would you go in?

10:44.529 --> 10:49.207
Me and brennan as journalists.

10:49.242 --> 10:53.886
Good. So we're all agreed.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.255
Am i wrong, or is
she acting really weird?

10:58.290 --> 11:00.292
All right, look, she was plugged
directly into ray larkin's

11:00.327 --> 11:01.911
emotions all the
way through his death.

11:01.946 --> 11:03.496
It must've been
incredibly intense.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.898
Yeah, but i've seen grief
before and i've seen trauma.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.900
Whatever emma is feeling
is something totally different.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.904
Which is why you're
going to keep your eye on her.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.912
Well, kept the place nice.

11:19.947 --> 11:23.115
It's like coming home.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.721
Don't bother. It doesn't work.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.723
How'd you know that?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.125
I just did.

11:34.727 --> 11:35.528
Yes?

11:35.928 --> 11:37.094
Hello, mrs. Larkin.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.131
I'm brennan mulwray
and this is emma delauro,

11:39.166 --> 11:41.098
and we're with
the metro-tribune.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.935
I know this isn't a good time,
but we're doing a memorial

11:42.970 --> 11:44.737
piece on your husband
and we were wondering if you had

11:45.137 --> 11:46.704
a moment to speak with us?

11:46.739 --> 11:49.141
We're deeply
sorry for your loss.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.708
I don't think so.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.344
You people are only deeply
sorry when you don't see your

11:52.379 --> 11:53.911
byline on the front page.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.513
I'm sorry. This
is frank sanders.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.550
He worked with my husband
at the fire department.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.153
Please come in.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.763
I went through his files
but i couldn't find anything.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.329
Okay, thanks.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.331
I'm not going to give up.

12:14.366 --> 12:18.771
Thanks, frank.
Thanks for everything.

12:23.576 --> 12:27.545
Ray didn't talk
much about work with me.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.984
When he was at home he would
try to put it out of his mind.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.351
Then i'd wake up at
2:00 a. m. And...

12:34.386 --> 12:36.789
and he'd be at his desk
trying to work stuff out.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.391
Was he any different
with this case?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.594
If anything he...
he was more obsessed.

12:41.994 --> 12:46.363
He said whoever it was
could just make fire appear.

12:46.398 --> 12:51.604
Did he ever
mention pattern as to what
the arsonist was burning?

12:51.639 --> 12:54.006
Huh, you sound like ray.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.408
He said there were...
there was always a pattern;

12:56.809 --> 12:59.577
it was just a
question of finding it.

12:59.612 --> 13:04.016
I think he was onto
something the morning he left.

13:04.051 --> 13:09.622
<crying> oh,
it was only yesterday.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.790
I'm so sorry.

13:12.825 --> 13:22.034
You seem so familiar.
I know you from somewhere.

13:22.434 --> 13:26.038
I don't think so.

13:26.438 --> 13:30.242
Would it be all right if
i took some photos of the house?

13:30.277 --> 13:34.046
It'll help our readers
get a feeling for how he lived.

13:34.081 --> 13:37.249
Okay.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.891
<breaking glass>

14:34.807 --> 14:36.774
what happened?

14:36.809 --> 14:38.811
She was standing
here looking in the mirror.

14:38.846 --> 14:40.377
And it broke.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.780
I didn't even touch it.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.217
Ray used to come in here
all the time when i would sew.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.620
He said we could look in it
every year and watch ourselves

14:47.655 --> 14:50.422
grow old together.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.591
Hello?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.393
Sorry, i didn't
know anyone else was here.

14:56.428 --> 15:00.833
It's okay. They're reporters.
They're doing a story on ray.

15:00.868 --> 15:03.200
This is ray's brother...
billy.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.438
Um... i... i did some
research before we came over.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.642
Well, ray was more than
just a great fireman, you know?

15:09.677 --> 15:12.009
He did everything for me.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.446
He found me a job, he lent
me money when i needed it...

15:14.847 --> 15:16.013
billy...

15:16.048 --> 15:18.050
i just want them
to get the whole picture
of who he was, lisa.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.052
I mean, he was my
brother, for god's sakes.

15:20.452 --> 15:24.056
I know. I know.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.660
You know what?

15:28.060 --> 15:30.027
This obviously
isn't a very good time.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.464
Mrs. Larkin, we'll
come back tomorrow, okay?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.066
Come on.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.037
Did you come up with anything?

15:40.072 --> 15:42.074
I've been trying to come
up with any connection between

15:42.109 --> 15:44.076
these fires, adam, and
i have come up with nothing.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.043
All right.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.480
Well, maybe we need to do
a little hands on investigating.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.883
Want us to check
the scene of the last fire?

15:50.918 --> 15:53.250
Yeah.
I'll go.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.887
The place has
already burned down, right?

15:54.922 --> 15:57.254
What's there
left to be afraid of?

15:57.289 --> 16:01.293
Besides, it'll give me something
useful to do on this case.

16:04.096 --> 16:07.299
That's a good sign.
Keep working.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.504
What the hell
is going on back there?

16:12.905 --> 16:15.272
Nothing. I don't know.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.110
Well, i think you do.
You're just not saying.

16:18.145 --> 16:22.114
I saw something.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.573
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:56.608 --> 17:59.011
I'm an investigator for
manor bay insurance company.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.814
Kendra james.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.181
I don't care who you are.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.019
Visits are supposed to
be cleared through my office.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.021
I called. You weren't there.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.189
So, any idea what happened here?

18:12.224 --> 18:16.428
Not yet. Whoever it is hasn't
left a clue in four fires.

18:16.463 --> 18:20.632
And this time the son-of-a-bitch
killed a friend of mine.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.000
That would be ray larkin.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.838
I worked under ray in the fire
marshall's office for six years.

18:25.873 --> 18:28.605
What the hell was he thinking?

18:28.640 --> 18:31.408
Should've waited for
backup before he came in here.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.246
Well,
at least it looks like you're
in line for a big promotion.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.414
What's that supposed to mean?
- Maybe nothing.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.453
Or maybe you know something
about what happened here.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.856
Maybe more than
you're willing to share.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.422
All right, that's enough.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.860
Investigator or not,
you're out of here - now.

19:02.674 --> 19:10.682
Back at the house,
in the mirror, i saw ray.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.450
What do you mean?

19:13.485 --> 19:19.056
I was loooking
at myself but i saw him.

19:19.091 --> 19:23.095
Okay, emma, we're
talking ghost stories here.

19:23.130 --> 19:26.263
You're starting to scare me.

19:26.298 --> 19:31.503
When i was a kid, my mom
was involved in the occult and

19:31.538 --> 19:36.708
spiritualism, but i don't
think she ever encountered

19:36.743 --> 19:40.129
anything other
than her own imagination.

19:40.164 --> 19:43.841
Yeah, but we're
talking about you here.

19:43.876 --> 19:47.484
She didn't know
about my abilities yet.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.123
One day she was doing a seance,
calling on a spirit of some

19:51.158 --> 19:56.145
young girl and i was in
the next room playing a game.

19:56.180 --> 20:01.133
Suddenly there's this
little girl in the room with me.

20:01.168 --> 20:06.703
She sits down
and we started playing.

20:06.738 --> 20:15.948
She had on this
old-fashioned dress and shoes
with buttons down the side.

20:15.983 --> 20:19.917
Let me guess - she was dead.

20:19.952 --> 20:24.356
But she came to me, instead
of my mom and her friends.

20:24.391 --> 20:29.126
So what are you saying?

20:29.161 --> 20:33.966
That ray has come
back to play with you?

20:34.001 --> 20:37.970
I think he has.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.376
You need to be careful
of where this is going.

20:44.411 --> 20:48.380
It's okay. I'm okay with it.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.983
Emma, you have no idea
what this guy's spirit or his

20:52.018 --> 20:55.187
emotions, or whatever
the hell it is, wants from you.

20:55.222 --> 20:57.006
He wants the exact
same thing we do -

20:57.041 --> 20:58.790
to catch who's ever
starting these fires.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.193
And how far is he willing
to go to get it, huh?

21:01.228 --> 21:02.794
Is he willing to kill you, too?

21:04.396 --> 21:06.798
Okay, adam, i think i figured
out how to solve this thing.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.400
In order to catch the
guy setting these blazes,

21:08.800 --> 21:10.402
we gotta get into his head.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.603
So what?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.605
You're
checking out the psychological
profiles of arsonists?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.172
Exactly.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.209
Now, according to the statistics
this guy's - he's male -

21:17.609 --> 21:19.611
he's white, he's in his
early twenties, he comes from a

21:19.646 --> 21:21.613
lower to working class family
with an absentee father, and

21:22.014 --> 21:26.418
over 70% become arsonists for
either revenge or excitement.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.820
And maybe this guy we're
looking for is motivated

21:28.855 --> 21:31.223
by a combination of both.

21:31.258 --> 21:32.824
How so?

21:33.225 --> 21:34.826
Well, i think this guy
gets a perverse pleasure out of

21:35.227 --> 21:36.428
creating these things.

21:36.828 --> 21:37.995
You know, the bigger the better.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.432
It excites him, it
gives him a sense of power,

21:40.467 --> 21:42.034
gives him a sense of control.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.036
Wow, he is a sick puppy, eh?

21:44.436 --> 21:46.003
Yeah, but the sick part?

21:46.038 --> 21:48.840
The more he
does it, the more he's going
to want to do it again.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.041
Adam, we got another fire.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.478
Contact the others.
Get 'em over there asap.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.880
Brennan, emma, our
firestarter's at it again.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.047
Where?

22:30.082 --> 22:31.683
Corner of fourth and wellesley.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.287
We're two minutes away.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.102
He's still here. I can feel him.

22:50.137 --> 22:52.121
Which way?

22:52.156 --> 22:54.106
I don't know.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.307
If you find him, call me.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.274
Keep your distance. Okay?

22:57.309 --> 22:59.311
I don't want you to
try and bring him down alone.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.278
I'm not going
to do anything stupid.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.516
You may not, but i don't
know what ray larkin would do.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.138
Hey!

23:45.757 --> 23:49.761
Don't think so.
- Brennan, wait.

23:58.570 --> 24:02.574
<fire alarm>
let's get out of here.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.114
I mean, he's the fire inspector.

24:09.149 --> 24:10.680
We're on the same team.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.317
Hey. All i know
is what i saw. Okay?

24:12.717 --> 24:14.319
He picked up a watch out of
the debris and slipped it in his

24:14.719 --> 24:16.286
pocket fast, like
he was trying to hide it.

24:16.321 --> 24:17.923
Well, maybe he was
going to tag it for evidence.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.124
No.

24:19.524 --> 24:21.091
He shoved it in his
pocket, not an evidence bag.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.128
And when he turned to talk to
me he looked as guilty as hell.

24:23.163 --> 24:24.747
That is a huge leap.

24:24.782 --> 24:26.296
Got an inscription.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.298
Firefighter's academy, 1991.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.335
Shame you couldn't
find something more
specific for us to work on.

24:30.370 --> 24:33.138
Just run it.

24:35.941 --> 24:38.743
Oh. Frank sanders.
Class of 1991.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.310
See? It is his watch.

24:40.345 --> 24:41.912
Well, hey, hold on, sipowicz.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.548
I mean, before
you get too excited here,

24:43.949 --> 24:45.515
let's just see how
all the pieces add up.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.552
Okay. He works for the fire
department - he knows fires.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.554
Hmm.
How they go up,
how they burn...

24:49.955 --> 24:51.121
uh huh.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.757
Best way to cause
the most devastation.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.324
Mmm.

24:54.359 --> 24:57.963
Eh? The guy we're looking
for, he knows what he's doing.

25:04.369 --> 25:07.172
Adam. There's something
going on with emma, okay,

25:07.207 --> 25:09.975
because ever since ray's
death she's been different.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.576
Oh, well, i can't
say i'm surprised.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.344
Why?

25:14.379 --> 25:17.547
Well, considering your
telempathic abilities, and the

25:17.582 --> 25:21.186
amazing connection that you
had with this guy when he died,

25:21.221 --> 25:24.406
well, i was afraid
there might be repercussions.

25:24.441 --> 25:27.592
Maybe what happened is
that ray's energy merged with

25:27.993 --> 25:30.360
yours when he died.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.397
So what are you saying?
We need to call in a priest?

25:32.797 --> 25:35.200
Listen, everything that
we experience, our thoughts,

25:35.235 --> 25:36.801
our emotions, our feelings,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.204
they're all just kinds of energy
passing through us, right?

25:39.604 --> 25:41.206
And just because the body dies,

25:41.606 --> 25:44.009
it doesn't mean that
the energy ceases to exist.

25:44.044 --> 25:45.976
It's gotta go somewhere.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.778
Yeah, that's exactly
what i think happened.

25:48.813 --> 25:52.817
You know, somehow ray's
spirit took over a part of me.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.620
Maybe it's because
at the moment of his death

25:55.655 --> 25:58.388
you were the path
of least resistance.

25:58.423 --> 26:01.426
And like or not, maybe
we can use his influence

26:01.461 --> 26:04.429
to find the guy who's
starting these fires.

26:04.829 --> 26:08.433
Adam, can i talk
to you for a second?

26:14.439 --> 26:17.242
Adam, she's vulnerable, and
you encouraging her to believe

26:17.277 --> 26:19.061
in this stuff
isn't going to help her.

26:19.096 --> 26:20.845
What if it helps
us find the arsonist?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.412
Well, i don't like it.

26:22.447 --> 26:24.449
And i don't believe that we
should let her think it's okay

26:24.484 --> 26:26.016
to let this guy control
her from the inside.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.453
I'm going to find the
bastard starting these fires.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.055
No, we are going
to catch him, emma.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.256
We. Not just you.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.822
I have to.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.859
All right, emma, look at me.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.262
Emma. Look at me.

26:37.662 --> 26:39.229
Look, i don't have a choice.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.266
It's like i have
to resolve this to be free.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.832
Well, until then,

26:42.867 --> 26:44.869
let's just be safe and keep
those priests on speed dial.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.838
I think frank sanders
could be our guy.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.875
I saw him pick a watch up out
of the ashes at the fire scene.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.278
Jesse and i
think it could be his.

26:53.313 --> 26:54.479
Hey, where you going?

26:54.879 --> 26:56.481
Mulligan's tavern.

26:56.516 --> 26:57.647
What is that?

26:57.682 --> 26:59.284
It's a fireman's hangout.

26:59.319 --> 27:01.286
She won't go alone.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.903
What are you doing here, billy?

27:18.938 --> 27:20.470
Your brother just died.

27:20.505 --> 27:22.507
Couldn't rivelli give
you a couple of days off?

27:22.542 --> 27:25.310
My choice. I can't sit at home.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.478
Makes me feel better,
me being around you guys.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.716
I swear,
every time i turn around
i expect him to be walking in.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.683
Ray was a good man.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.319
Hey, billy,
get your ass over here.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.921
Your wings'll be
up in a minute, chase.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.488
Forget the wings.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.125
We're lifting
one to your brother.

27:53.738 --> 27:56.106
Inspector sanders.

27:56.141 --> 27:58.543
I got nothing
to say to the press.

27:58.578 --> 28:00.945
You're gonna want to talk to us.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.912
I said, no comment.

28:02.947 --> 28:06.350
Well, then, i guess we'll just
have to print what we've got.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.754
Your
watch was found at the scene
of the chemical factory fire.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.721
What are you talking about?

28:11.756 --> 28:14.959
It was inscribed by the
academy the year you graduated.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.727
Gotta admit, it
doesn't look so good.

28:17.762 --> 28:21.366
So how come you didn't
turn it over to evidence, frank?

28:21.401 --> 28:24.169
Inspector sanders.

28:24.569 --> 28:27.737
So that blonde is working
for you, too, is that it?

28:27.772 --> 28:30.175
I should've hauled her ass in
for impeding an investigation.

28:30.210 --> 28:33.778
So then you deny it?
Watch isn't yours?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.345
Oh, come on.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.382
You've never had a problem
wagging your jaw before.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.985
Time to open up, frank.
Is it yours?

28:50.195 --> 28:51.796
Now take a hike.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.564
Fine, then. Whose is it?

28:54.599 --> 28:59.404
Oh, come on, you
trust me, don't you?

28:59.439 --> 29:01.771
It was ray's.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.773
No. That's impossible.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.211
Well, maybe it fell off him
when he was caught in the blaze.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.777
No.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.814
It was at the point of
origin, where the fire started.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.816
So what are you saying,
that ray's the arsonist?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.783
No, it doesn't make any sense.

29:13.818 --> 29:15.820
I worked side by side
with that guy for six years.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.822
If he's guilty,
then i'm jack the ripper.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.391
The fact of the
matter is, you never know.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.828
I sure wish someone would
explain to me how it got there.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.231
Something's wrong
here. This doesn't add up.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.832
Well, it couldn't
have been ray's.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.834
There was another
arson this afternoon.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.237
There's no telling whether
or not that was a copycat.

29:32.272 --> 29:34.256
Ray is not the arsonist.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.241
I hope you're right.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.649
Why didn't you nail sanders?

29:45.049 --> 29:46.651
He's not the guy, shal.
The watch was ray's.

29:46.686 --> 29:48.618
Well, are you
sure he wasn't lying?

29:48.653 --> 29:50.655
Have you ever
known anybody that could lie
once emma blew their mind?

29:51.055 --> 29:52.657
Where is emma?

29:57.862 --> 30:00.264
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.667
But i know you're a night owl.

30:02.702 --> 30:05.034
How do you know?

30:05.069 --> 30:07.036
Well, life as
the wife of a fireman,

30:07.071 --> 30:09.874
i guess you have to
adjust to the crazy hours.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.077
Why don't you come on in.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.482
How are you holding up?
- Okay.

30:17.882 --> 30:21.085
It's a lot, you know, with
the arrangements and everything.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.254
Oh. I must be losing my mind.

30:24.289 --> 30:29.894
I'm just used to bringing
ray a cup whenever he came home.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.097
That's okay.
Look, i wanted to...

30:33.132 --> 30:37.066
to ask you about ray's watch.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.904
You know, the one he got when
he graduated from the academy.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.107
He kept it in the
top drawer of his closet.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.109
Oh, but he never wore it.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.313
He hated watches.

30:48.713 --> 30:52.317
He used to say
it just reminded him of the
time he spent away from me.

30:52.352 --> 30:54.684
What happened to it?

30:54.719 --> 30:56.921
I gave it to his brother billy.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.088
I didn't think ray would mind.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.125
I mean, billy always dreamed
of making it into the academy.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.895
Night, bill.
- Yeah.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.333
And i guess i just thought
this was the next best thing.

31:11.135 --> 31:13.538
Brennan, no!

31:23.815 --> 31:25.381
Where could i find billy?

31:25.416 --> 31:29.020
He's at mulligan's.
Why? What's going on?

31:29.055 --> 31:32.624
I just have to
ask him a few questions.

31:33.024 --> 31:34.591
Okay. I'll go with you.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.428
No. No, i... i
need to do this alone.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.796
But this is about
ray's death, isn't it?

31:39.831 --> 31:41.833
Look, when this is all over,
i'll let you know what's going

31:41.868 --> 31:46.638
on, but right now i
need you to stay here, okay?

31:47.038 --> 31:49.841
I know you're going
to think this sounds crazy,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.644
but whenever you're here
i have the strangest sense that

31:52.679 --> 31:56.648
ray is in the room with us.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.054
Who are you?
A friend.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.056
Look, i gotta go.
Wait, no.

32:05.456 --> 32:08.259
There's so many things
i wish i could've told him.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.662
So many things i wanted to say.

32:10.697 --> 32:13.064
He already knows.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.267
You have to let him go.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.435
I'm not ready.

32:19.470 --> 32:25.877
You know when
he used to say that he had
an angel on his shoulder?

32:25.912 --> 32:31.082
That was always
his parting line.

32:31.117 --> 32:35.887
That angel was you.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.490
Good bye, lisa.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.100
Good bye, ray.

32:53.504 --> 32:56.272
Emma, where are you?

32:56.307 --> 32:59.475
Emma. Tell us what's going on.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.112
She's there. Her
comlink is activated.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.114
Just not answering us.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.081
Okay. Adam,
keep looking for her.

33:05.116 --> 33:05.917
If you find her, give us
a call. We'll be in the helix.

33:05.952 --> 33:07.483
We will?
Yes.

33:07.518 --> 33:11.522
In case our arson bug
is looking to make an encore.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.126
Emma. Do you read me?

33:15.526 --> 33:17.093
Copy...

33:17.128 --> 33:22.734
emma. I know you can hear me.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.538
Emma's not here right now.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.912
Still no hot spots.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.548
What makes you think this
guy's going to strike again?

33:37.949 --> 33:39.515
Because emma's on the trail.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.152
She's figured it out and
now she's planning on taking him

33:41.187 --> 33:42.353
down on her own.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.920
Why would emma do that?

33:43.955 --> 33:46.157
Emma wouldn't. Ray's taken over.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.877
Okay. I don't
know about you guys,

33:48.912 --> 33:51.562
but i am sufficiently
creeped out.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.332
We're closed.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.770
We need to talk, billy.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.572
You're that reporter that
was in my sister-in-law's house.

34:01.607 --> 34:06.743
Why are you looking
at me like that?

34:06.778 --> 34:10.782
I just can't believe
you had me fooled for so long.

34:10.817 --> 34:13.402
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:13.437 --> 34:15.987
You know you
never could lie to me.

34:16.022 --> 34:19.956
I think you better leave.

34:19.991 --> 34:23.194
Just tell me...
- why you did it.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.763
Who are you?

34:26.797 --> 34:30.400
Don't you think you owe
your brother an explanation?

34:30.436 --> 34:31.601
Ray?

34:32.003 --> 34:35.606
Tell me why
you set those fires.

34:36.007 --> 34:40.210
Because i can. Because
it's something i can do.

34:40.246 --> 34:44.415
You... you were the
hero, and i was a wannabe.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.382
Do you know what it's like,

34:46.417 --> 34:49.018
living under that
shadow day in and day out?

34:49.054 --> 34:51.621
Constantly being reminded
what a failure i am?

34:52.023 --> 34:53.589
Until one day,

34:53.623 --> 34:56.828
i discover there's something
i can do that no one else can.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.795
You know? And it feels good.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.832
And for once,
something feels good.

35:01.232 --> 35:04.400
For a while there,
we were quite a team.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.838
I'd start the fires
and you'd try to put them out.

35:06.873 --> 35:09.240
People died
in those fires, billy.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.844
I died.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.846
I didn't mean that, ray.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.848
Look, you weren't
supposed to be there.

35:16.883 --> 35:18.815
Billy, you need help.

35:18.850 --> 35:22.453
You have to turn yourself in.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.654
No.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.225
Billy, don't do this.

35:29.260 --> 35:35.266
Sorry, ray. I...
i don't have a choice.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.668
Billy, please don't do this.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.853
Billy, please...!

35:56.888 --> 36:00.491
This time you die for good!

36:01.292 --> 36:02.894
Ugh!

36:12.103 --> 36:14.505
Billy, wait!

36:19.310 --> 36:20.476
Whoa, we got trouble.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.113
Where?
- Millburn and delaware.

36:22.513 --> 36:25.716
That's mulligan's tavern.
- We just came from there.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.322
Well, "there"
ain't gonna be for much longer
from the readings i'm pulling.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.324
He's really torching the place.

36:37.728 --> 36:40.131
Billy, stop this, please!

36:40.531 --> 36:42.533
We have to get out of here!

37:01.485 --> 37:03.087
You don't have to go in, shal.

37:03.122 --> 37:04.288
I'm going in.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.097
Emma!

37:13.132 --> 37:14.699
Emma!

37:15.099 --> 37:18.302
<coughing> emma!

37:18.337 --> 37:21.105
Emma!

37:22.707 --> 37:26.310
<coughing>
somebody help me!

37:35.920 --> 37:37.922
Shal, help me!

37:59.543 --> 38:01.545
Shal, help me!

38:17.962 --> 38:19.964
Come on.

38:22.366 --> 38:23.767
Brennan, i got her.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.134
Gotta get out of there.

38:25.169 --> 38:27.571
You heard her, jess. Let's move.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.803
Oh... no! Billy's in there.
I have to save him.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.205
No. It's too dangerous.

39:06.811 --> 39:09.213
I'm not
going to let him just die.

39:09.248 --> 39:12.782
I have to help him.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.418
Billy's dead. There's
nothing you can do!

39:14.453 --> 39:16.020
Ray, listen to me!
Okay? It's over.

39:16.055 --> 39:19.441
You have to let emma go.

39:19.476 --> 39:22.827
Move on. Time to move on.

39:47.651 --> 39:50.019
Emma?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.857
Shal, how did...
how did you...?

39:52.892 --> 39:54.458
I don't know.

39:54.859 --> 39:57.661
I guess my fear
of losing you was stronger
than my fear of the fire.

39:57.696 --> 40:03.667
All i know is i don't
want to try that again.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.669
Let's go.

40:21.285 --> 40:24.088
Hey, how are you feeling?

40:24.488 --> 40:28.092
More like myself,
if that's what you mean.

40:28.492 --> 40:31.660
Good.

40:31.695 --> 40:34.498
I can only imagine what all of
this must've been like for you.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.465
It's like we were one.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.668
You know, each of our life
experiences, merged together to

40:39.703 --> 40:46.110
the point where
i don't even know where
i began and ray left off.

40:46.145 --> 40:48.112
And now?

40:48.512 --> 40:51.715
I know that ray still
wishes he could've saved billy,

40:51.750 --> 40:55.284
even after everything
that he did.

40:55.319 --> 40:57.321
Well, it doesn't
matter what billy did,

40:57.356 --> 40:59.741
he was still his kid brother.

40:59.776 --> 41:02.091
Went to see frank sanders.

41:02.126 --> 41:06.530
I talked him
into giving this to me.

41:06.565 --> 41:13.702
I thought you should have it.

41:13.737 --> 41:20.144
Thanks. But i'm afraid
this isn't mine to keep.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.951
Well, you want
me to come with you?

41:26.986 --> 41:29.318
No, thanks.

41:29.353 --> 41:33.757
I think this is something
i need to do alone.
