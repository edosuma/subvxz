Black Lightning...

00:01.459 --> 00:04.253
                   As soon as
the Markovians are gone,

00:04.294 --> 00:07.881
      everything will go back
to the way it was before.

00:07.924 --> 00:08.590
    What do you want me to do?

00:08.590 --> 00:12.846
     In that bag, you'll find
a perfect copy of your suit.

00:12.887 --> 00:13.929
    Now, let's get you changed.

00:13.971 --> 00:18.893
                     There's
a Markovian data farm.
We need to take it out.

00:19.518 --> 00:20.812
             [grunts]

00:42.417 --> 00:46.713
       All right, so this is
the third night in a row

00:46.755 --> 00:49.423
  I've woken up at exactly 3:33.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.427
          I looked it up
and 3:33 is

00:55.179 --> 00:58.475
        equilibrium between
your mind, body and spirit.

00:58.515 --> 01:00.935
        And it's no surprise
that my equilibrium is off.

01:02.603 --> 01:06.356
         Considering what
this occupation is doing
to my family,

01:06.399 --> 01:07.692
   what it's doing to Freeland.

01:10.694 --> 01:13.239
      [soft chuckle] You know
what I wish,

01:15.658 --> 01:18.495
    I really wish that I could
go back in time.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.245
          Like, way back.

01:20.287 --> 01:22.831
        Before I knew what
a metagene was-back.
[chuckles]

01:25.793 --> 01:28.754
    -Because I think the thing
that's really tripping me out,
-[laptop thuds]

01:30.965 --> 01:33.009
          is I don't know
who to believe anymore.

01:34.384 --> 01:36.763
     I really don't. And also,

01:39.765 --> 01:42.018
    I think I've killed people.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.480
    Anissa, not regular people,
Markovians, but still,

01:46.522 --> 01:47.314
           still people.

01:47.356 --> 01:50.109
    And I know you're not gonna
be happy about this either,
but,

01:51.277 --> 01:54.072
  [sighs] I've also been working
with Odell.

01:56.573 --> 01:57.866
        I know... [laughs]

01:59.576 --> 02:03.706
        But I'm just trying
to do what's right,
and I'm confused.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.792
           I'm confused,
cause I got Odell...

02:05.834 --> 02:07.668
       Look, it's like this,

02:07.709 --> 02:09.545
     I got Odell in this hand,

02:09.586 --> 02:11.673
        saying that the ASA
and their perimeter

02:11.713 --> 02:15.217
     is the only thing stopping
Freeland from being annihilated
by the Markovians.

02:15.259 --> 02:16.718
   That's what I have over here.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.597
         And in this hand,
I've got Dad

02:19.639 --> 02:23.143
        Mr. Black Lightning,
"the protector of all
that is Freeland,"

02:25.436 --> 02:28.105
       joining a resistance
against the ASA.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.942
      And it's the resistance
co-founded by you, Harriet.

02:34.987 --> 02:36.990
       And my heart tells me
that y'all are right.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.574
            That's what
my heart is telling me.

02:38.615 --> 02:42.162
     But my head is telling me
something totally different.

02:42.203 --> 02:45.414
    It's telling me that Odell
and what he's doing
is necessary.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.126
    Because why else would Mom
be working with those two?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.545
     Right after they beat Dad
down outside of Garfield.

02:50.586 --> 02:53.006
      Why would she still be
working with him?

02:53.046 --> 02:55.633
        She has to believe
in what they're doing.
[scoffs]

02:58.510 --> 03:01.598
       I know I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.479
    When both sides are right,
and both sides are wrong,

03:10.731 --> 03:14.985
           what do I do?
Like... Who do I follow?

03:21.783 --> 03:26.163

send you this, but,

-Yeah.

We can't lose hope.

04:42.572 --> 04:46.034

05:03.302 --> 05:05.846
    Agent Odell, what the hell
are you doing?

05:05.887 --> 05:08.223
       I had to speak to you
and this felt like the most

considering you're not

05:10.893 --> 05:11.728

05:11.769 --> 05:15.230
        -What if my family
had been home?
-But they're not, correct?

05:17.274 --> 05:19.235
      I heard the Markovians
almost killed you.

05:19.276 --> 05:21.321
   I have a mission to fulfill,
Ms. Pierce,

05:21.362 --> 05:24.824

until it's completed.

05:24.865 --> 05:27.117
     A mission that is getting
more complicated,

05:27.160 --> 05:31.413
  due to the rather public stance
your father and sister took

05:31.456 --> 05:32.497
         against the ASA.

05:32.540 --> 05:37.461
   Look, my dad doesn't normally
overreact, so there had to be
a reason why he went all

05:37.502 --> 05:38.338
       "You shall not pass"
on your commandos.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.716
    This resistance is quickly
moving from an annoyance
to a nuisance.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.012
     It is making it difficult
for us to defend the city

05:46.053 --> 05:47.596
   in the best manner possible.

  Yeah, Odell, the ASA is at war
with my family,

         The Markovians are
at the gates, Ms. Pierce,
and we have to push back.

06:05.113 --> 06:05.906
     Why should I believe you?

06:05.906 --> 06:10.119
 Your father's outdated strategy
for Freeland doesn't work.

        It hasn't for years

to your friend, Khalil.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.963
     Do you know how many lives
were saved when you destroyed
that data farm?

06:21.004 --> 06:25.218
   More than Black Lightning has
in his entire existence.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.221
           Yeah, but how
many lives were lost, though?

06:28.262 --> 06:30.305
       Huh? How many people
did I kill?

06:30.348 --> 06:33.100
    The Markovians were trying
to breech our systems

06:33.141 --> 06:35.937
      and find a way through
the perimeter.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.730
      If they had succeeded,

06:37.771 --> 06:41.983
         Freeland would be
the definition of biblical hell
right now.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.153

 I'm asking you to do it again.

threat from Markovian

on our perimeter.

at staggered intervals.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.882

07:05.925 --> 07:09.095
          neutralize with
extreme prejudice.

07:11.471 --> 07:15.475
   Oh, and Ms. Pierce, the time
for you to pick a side,

07:16.726 --> 07:18.521
      is rapidly approaching.

07:21.064 --> 07:22.274

and they're gonna
hit back hard.

07:41.877 --> 07:43.713
   Maybe we hit first this time.

       I don't know, but I'm
really tired of reacting.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.677
    This is kill or be killed.

07:49.718 --> 07:51.345
          We don't kill.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.805

07:58.478 --> 07:59.896

you want to say?

08:04.649 --> 08:07.110

were attacked,

08:07.944 --> 08:08.987
          it was Khalil.

08:10.113 --> 08:11.656
             -Khalil?
-Yes.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.283
     No, no, we buried Khalil.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.452
       Dad, I'm telling you,
he's still alive.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.622
   He killed Tavon and if it was
not for Uncle Gambi,

08:17.663 --> 08:18.456
       he would have killed
my ass too.

is that I tried reasoning
with him.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.917
        [thunder and rain]

11:07.957 --> 11:11.629
     Anissa, have you seen it
outside tonight?

11:11.671 --> 11:15.633
        The sky is all red
and all the lightning,
did you see that?

11:15.674 --> 11:19.386
     Girl, forget the weather,
I can't believe you almost
outed me.

11:19.427 --> 11:20.971
        I can't believe you
still need to be outed.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.057
     I haven't found the right
time to tell them, okay?

11:23.807 --> 11:24.725
       Look, I get it, okay?

11:24.725 --> 11:31.190
    Mr. Conservative Secretary
of Education already has
a daughter locked up.

11:31.231 --> 11:34.150
      We don't need the other
one making the news
for being a lesbian, I get it.

11:34.192 --> 11:36.111
       You do know that Dad,
he only took that job

11:36.153 --> 11:38.947
  to make it look like he didn't
agree with what you did.

11:38.989 --> 11:42.118
    Otherwise, we all would be
locked up right now,
and you know it.

11:42.158 --> 11:45.120
    Yeah, I know that, Anissa,
but it still hurts.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.039
       'Cause the truth is,
he knew about the whole thing.

11:48.081 --> 11:50.292
         He supported me.
He said, "It's your decision."

11:50.334 --> 11:51.876
  And then, he didn't defend me.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.505
      -Not publicly, anyway.
-Yeah.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
       Well, I'll tell them
soon, okay?

12:00.009 --> 12:03.346
         Low-key have to,
because... If that makes
any sense...

12:03.389 --> 12:06.100
    Oh, it doesn't. [chuckles]
What you talking about?

12:06.142 --> 12:08.476
          [both laughing]

12:08.519 --> 12:11.397
          All right, well,
I may, or may not
have met a girl.

12:11.438 --> 12:14.024
        [gasps] Wait, wait!
Give me the tea,
give me the tea.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.360
        All right, be quiet.
Her name is Shaquandalyn.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.572
        -Uh, Shaquandalyn?
-Yeah.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.448
    So she's black. [chuckles]

12:21.490 --> 12:23.033
         I'm just saying,
you usually go for--

12:23.075 --> 12:25.786
         Okay, calm down.
I'm just saying.

12:25.827 --> 12:27.580
     Never mind, I don't want
to be offensive. Go on.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.957
    -She is a medical student,
just like me.
-Okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.918
            Oh, my God,
and she's so beautiful.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.171
     -She makes me feel like--
-Like a natural woman?

12:36.087 --> 12:38.423
           You laughing,
but yes, she does.

12:39.924 --> 12:41.594
        I mean, we only been
on a couple of dates,

12:41.634 --> 12:43.511
    but we're already planning
a trip to Jamaica,

12:43.553 --> 12:46.890
  and I just never, I never felt
anything like this.

12:49.058 --> 12:53.022
   My fault. I'm just filling up
the whole room with
all this air.

12:53.062 --> 12:55.649
                -No.
-What's good with you
and Khalil? Ya'll straight?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.902
      Yeah. Um, everything's
great, actually.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.571
    I told him that the ASA let
me out for Christmas, so...

13:01.822 --> 13:03.448
    -He's supposed to stop by.
-Hmm.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.909
       But he actually just
got a full ride to UCLA.

13:07.076 --> 13:09.455
         [laughs] I know,
I was so proud of him.

13:11.831 --> 13:14.210
     It's a little bittersweet
though, because he leaves
next August.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.461
  And I'm gonna miss his visits.

13:17.962 --> 13:19.715
     You think you'll gonna do
the long distance thing?

13:21.008 --> 13:21.591
   I don't really see the point.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.094
  I still have a couple of years
left in the Pit.

13:25.929 --> 13:27.972
     But it's fine. Whatever.

13:28.014 --> 13:31.018
  I never really understood love
anyways, so it's probably best

13:31.059 --> 13:34.562
          he just leaves.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.606
      I mean, look at our own
parents, they can't stand
to be together--

13:36.649 --> 13:38.067
  Girl, can't stand to be apart.

13:38.107 --> 13:40.027
   Exactly, it's like an endless
romcom.

13:40.068 --> 13:41.861
          -[both chuckle]
-Like a nightmare.

13:41.903 --> 13:43.154
         -[glass shatters]
-What was that?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.114
              [thuds]

13:49.161 --> 13:50.703
     -[officer] On your knees!
-[Jefferson groans]

13:51.580 --> 13:54.415
             [grunts]

13:54.457 --> 13:55.084
          [officer] Yeah,
we got him in custody.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.628
           -[both grunt]
-[Good Jen] What are you doing?

13:57.669 --> 13:58.379
          Get off of me.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.548
     -[officer] Stop resisting!
-[Good Jen] What do you want?

14:01.381 --> 14:02.674
            Get off me!

14:02.716 --> 14:04.051
  Why are you doing this to Dad?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.510
             [wheezes]

14:10.307 --> 14:13.434
  [stammering] Agent Odell. Why?
Are you...

14:13.476 --> 14:18.524
            Mr. Pierce,
Mr. Pierce, Mr. Pierce.

14:18.566 --> 14:23.403
        You made me travel
all the way here on Christmas,

14:23.445 --> 14:25.614
         because you can't
follow instructions?

14:25.655 --> 14:29.409
        No. No, Agent Odell,
I've done everything
the High Council asked of me.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.620
      I've taught ASA history
their way.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.499
    I told everyone to turn in

14:35.540 --> 14:37.625
        meta so they could
be cured, or cultivated.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.793
           -Is that so?
-Yes.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.423
        [Agent Odell] Hmm.

14:42.463 --> 14:45.049
          I have to say,
that your friend,
the good Reverend...

14:47.302 --> 14:48.428
            Well, um...

14:51.514 --> 14:55.602
   Okay, okay, Jefferson Pierce
and I have been running
an underground railroad

14:55.644 --> 14:57.812
           for the metas
for the last month.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.106
    We were just trying to give
the last kids the chance

15:00.149 --> 15:02.442
      -to have the same kind
of freedom we got.
-[shot fired]

15:03.277 --> 15:04.820
             -[gasps]
-[Jefferson] No!

15:04.861 --> 15:06.322
      [Anissa] Can you please
just let my dad go?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.990
          [Good Jen] Yeah.
He didn't even do anything.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.991
    That's where you're wrong,
young lady,

15:10.033 --> 15:11.659
    I'm afraid your father did

15:11.701 --> 15:13.828
           -No, no, no.
-too much.

15:13.870 --> 15:17.750
      -Disobedience must run
in the family, Ms. Pierce.
-Dad!

15:20.543 --> 15:21.961
        No, no, no! Please!

15:22.004 --> 15:23.630
           -[shot fired]
-[all gasp]

15:23.672 --> 15:25.673
             [crying]

15:25.716 --> 15:27.676
          [all screaming]

15:27.717 --> 15:29.677
         [Good Jen crying]

15:29.720 --> 15:32.181
         No! Let go of me!

15:32.221 --> 15:34.892
        [screaming] Anissa!

15:36.393 --> 15:38.227
    [Good Jen] Anissa, help me!

15:38.269 --> 15:39.145
             [crying]

15:50.698 --> 15:52.368
              [Gambi]
Anissa, what's going on?
What happened?

15:52.408 --> 15:54.119
   Jen called about an hour ago,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.413
      and she said she needed
to talk.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.414
   I didn't know what she needed
to talk about,

15:58.456 --> 16:01.210
     so I told her to meet me
at my place.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.544
    And I came, and I found her
like this.

16:03.586 --> 16:04.837
   Where did she get this suit?

16:04.879 --> 16:06.423
      'cause it's not the one
I made her.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.841
          -I don't know.
-Dad, no!

16:07.883 --> 16:09.717
           -[Jen gasping]
-Jen, Jen! Jen.

16:10.677 --> 16:12.888
       Anissa, Dad is dead.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.139
               -What?
-Dad is dead.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.474
    What is she talking about?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.186
         [thunder crashes]

16:32.700 --> 16:33.826
         [Good Jen sighs]

16:34.951 --> 16:36.412
              [beeps]

16:36.452 --> 16:37.495
                       Enter.

16:42.625 --> 16:43.668
               Hey.

16:44.961 --> 16:45.546
   Mom wanted me to let you know

16:45.586 --> 16:47.923
      that she's headed back
from the funeral home.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.591
         Crazy traffic due
to that weird thunderstorm.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.385
  I really wish they'd let me go.

16:52.427 --> 16:54.263
    I can't believe Odell even
let me visit you.

16:54.303 --> 16:57.474
   Oh, I can. It's his sick way
of saying he's sorry.

16:57.932 --> 16:58.558
           Yeah, maybe.

16:58.558 --> 17:01.437
    No, not maybe. He said it.
That's what he said.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.442
      Look, Mom really wanted
time alone with Dad
for a while.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.943
     Well, it's a little late
for that, don't you think?

17:08.986 --> 17:09.737
      Come on, don't be hard
on her, Jen.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.740
       Anissa, I'm surprised
she even had time
to help at all.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.407
          She loves Dad.
They loved each other.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.992
      They just couldn't find
a way to make it work.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.077
         Because it's hard
to figure it out

17:18.119 --> 17:20.372
  when you're obsessed with work
like she is.

17:20.413 --> 17:21.039
       -[Lightning mumbling]
-She's busy all the time.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.000
     She never even visits me
in here. Her own daughter.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.294
       -[Lightning] Jennifer!
-[Good Jen] Look at this!

17:25.335 --> 17:27.003
   She can't even come visit me!

17:27.046 --> 17:29.131
         -Damn, I'm sorry.
-You're sorry.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.717
    But, Jen, it's really hard
for her to see you like
this in here.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.470
    [voice breaking] It's hard
being in here like this!

17:34.510 --> 17:38.057
  If it weren't for you and Dad,
I wouldn't get a visitor.

17:39.599 --> 17:41.059
    [crying] And he's dead now.

17:42.435 --> 17:43.729
            He's gone.

17:44.270 --> 17:45.814
         This is my fault.

17:46.731 --> 17:47.566
        It's all my fault.

17:47.566 --> 17:52.237
         All I had to do,
was sit my ass down
somewhere and listen to him.

17:52.278 --> 17:55.449
          All I had to do,
was listen to his instructions.

17:55.490 --> 17:57.659
         Do what he said.
He would still be alive.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.412
   Jen, stop it, okay! Stop it!

18:00.453 --> 18:03.207
       We all made choices,

18:03.248 --> 18:06.667
     during and after the war.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.047
     He died the way he lived,
with and without powers,

18:10.713 --> 18:12.298
      fighting for Freeland.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.513
            [sniffles]

18:18.555 --> 18:20.598
        [sad music playing]

18:21.391 --> 18:24.936
             [beeping]

18:28.106 --> 18:29.691
   Her vitals are disappearing.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.903
        [breath trembling]

18:35.072 --> 18:37.865
  Disappearing like she's dying?

18:37.907 --> 18:40.285
      Uh, disappearing like,
I can't explain it.

18:41.994 --> 18:44.373
            All I know,
is that this all started

18:44.413 --> 18:45.833
     once the sky turned red.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.500
         [thunder roaring]

18:47.542 --> 18:49.336
          Have you called
your mom and dad?

18:49.377 --> 18:52.798
         Dad's on his way,
but I still haven't been
able to reach Mom.

18:52.839 --> 18:55.049
          Can you try her?
Maybe she's at the Pit.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.385
         No, your Mom's not
in the Pit anymore.

18:57.426 --> 18:59.846
        During the battle of
Franklin Terrace,
the ASA tried to lock

18:59.887 --> 19:03.099
    your mom down and I managed
to get her out of there
just in time.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.893
          Oaky, but where
is she right now?

19:04.934 --> 19:06.561
         [thunder crashes]

19:11.900 --> 19:13.986
    [suspenseful music playing]

19:30.460 --> 19:31.627
              [sighs]

19:38.343 --> 19:39.552
          [message alert]

19:44.473 --> 19:46.184
             Mom, it's Anissa,

19:46.226 --> 19:48.436
     I really need you to meet
me in my place now.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.229
             -[static]
-Mom, get over here.

19:49.270 --> 19:52.481
     It's something with Jen.
I don't know what to do.

19:52.523 --> 19:53.650
             [static]

19:57.820 --> 20:00.406
             [beeping]

20:09.625 --> 20:11.042
             Jennifer,
can you let me in, please?

20:17.048 --> 20:18.424
      Jen, please let me in.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.930
          [sighs] Enter.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.154
        I was gonna ask how
you're doing,
but I think I know.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.159
         Oh, so you think
you know me now.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.452
       -That's a bit harsh,
don't you think?
-No.

20:48.038 --> 20:51.250
   What's harsh, is watching Dad
getting shot down like a dog.

20:51.290 --> 20:52.792
        Mom, that's harsh.

20:55.753 --> 20:57.338
            I understand
you're angry with me.

20:59.548 --> 21:01.676
    I should have visited more.
I'm sorry.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.144
              [sighs]

21:18.067 --> 21:21.113
    I wish there was something
I could say to make
it all better.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.784
     But this isn't something
words can heal.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.788
           Just... Time.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.545
        I can tell you this.
Your father was so very
proud of you.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.134
        How would you know?

21:46.512 --> 21:49.516
    Jennifer, your father and I
loved each other very much.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.147
    We spoke almost every day.

21:57.523 --> 21:59.108
      He was my best friend.

21:59.734 --> 22:02.069
              [sighs]

22:02.112 --> 22:05.490
      He always talked about
how proud he was of you.

22:05.531 --> 22:07.326
          About how many
lives you'd saved.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.660
            Except his.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.663
    No, Jennifer, he was proud
because you did something
he couldn't.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.586
  You brought peace to Freeland.

22:17.626 --> 22:21.256
             Yeah, but,
but what kind of peace is it,

22:22.632 --> 22:25.093
     when Odell can just walk
into our house and

22:26.845 --> 22:28.137
        kill Dad like that.

22:29.597 --> 22:30.932
     What kind of peace is it?

22:33.477 --> 22:34.978
          It's a different
kind of peace, honey.

22:35.811 --> 22:36.480
              [sighs]

22:36.520 --> 22:40.107
       And if you hadn't made
the choice to use your powers

22:40.150 --> 22:42.986
  to turn Freeland's water supply
into something that would stop

22:43.028 --> 22:45.614
            meta powers,
thousands of children

22:45.654 --> 22:47.365
         would be fighting
the ASA's wars.

22:47.406 --> 22:50.117
      They were going to turn
everyone in Freeland
into a meta.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.496
      You, you stopped that.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.247
  Yeah, but was it worth it, Mom?

22:55.332 --> 22:55.874
         Was it worth it?

22:55.874 --> 22:59.377
       Was it worth me being
locked in here?

22:59.419 --> 23:00.836
     Was it worth Dad's life?

23:05.717 --> 23:06.801
               Yes.

23:13.724 --> 23:15.309
            -I'm sorry.
-[sniffles]

23:16.060 --> 23:17.186
            [sniffles]

23:18.814 --> 23:20.981
         [thunder roaring]

23:24.528 --> 23:26.445
          -What the hell?
-Jeff.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.989
         It's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

23:30.616 --> 23:31.992
        But you can figure
it out, right?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.787
         You can help her.

23:33.828 --> 23:35.579
      [sighs] We're gonna do
everything we can.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.838
  [Gambi] It's complicated, Jeff.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.508
  [Jefferson] Simplify it for me.

23:46.549 --> 23:50.636
   [Gambi] Those weird red skies
are kicking off massive amounts
of anti-matter,

23:50.679 --> 23:53.347
  and since Jen's powers convert
her cells into pure energy...

23:53.390 --> 23:55.142
   [Lynn] She's more susceptible
to the effects.

23:55.182 --> 23:57.853
         So you're saying,
she's literally at two places
at once.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.396
    At least, that's the theory
I'm working with.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.776
         I can't prove it,
but Jen woke up convinced
you were dead.

24:04.817 --> 24:06.361
           And it didn't
come from a dream.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.029
       It was a real memory.

24:09.071 --> 24:11.407
    I think that we're dealing
with parallel universes.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.492
        Oh, come on, Gambi,
parallel universe?

24:13.535 --> 24:15.871
     That's the best you got.
That is a big leap.

24:15.912 --> 24:19.415
   Parallel universe, it's been
a staple theory
of modern physics.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.711
  Like I said, I can't prove it.

24:22.751 --> 24:25.297
              -[beep]
There is an incoming
call from Chief Henderson,

24:25.337 --> 24:26.798
     -shall I put in through?
-[Anissa] Yes.

24:26.839 --> 24:27.798
         You're connected.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.426
                  Blackbird,
I've been calling you
and calling you.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.510
            Henderson,
I'm dealing with an emergency.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.636
         -[shooting heard]
-So am I. I'm getting killed
out here. Literally killed.

24:32.679 --> 24:37.392
     I don't know what you're
dealing with, but either you
or Black Lightning

24:37.433 --> 24:38.894
       need to come out here
by the end of the night

24:38.934 --> 24:40.228
       there ain't gonna be
no resistance.

24:40.269 --> 24:41.605
   [Jefferson] Sorry, Henderson,
I gotta be here.

24:41.645 --> 24:44.023
       No, Jeff, you don't.

24:44.065 --> 24:44.941
         What? Excuse me?

24:44.941 --> 24:47.903
       -[shooting continues]
-This escalation with the ASA,
it's your fault.

24:47.943 --> 24:51.198
    You decided to take a stand
at Franklin Terrace, you.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.200
    So now, you made your bed,
you go lie in it.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.410
       My fault? Lie in it?

24:55.451 --> 24:57.287
     Come on, Lynn, you think
this is all on me now?

24:57.328 --> 24:59.580
        -Whose fault is it?
-Guys, please.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.582
  We can argue about fault later.

25:00.582 --> 25:04.376
    Right now, we all have a lot
of work to do, if Jen's gonna
survive the night.

25:04.419 --> 25:07.672
      Yes. And I'll stay here
in case trouble reaches
these doors.

25:08.714 --> 25:09.758
        [shooting continues
over speaker]

25:13.428 --> 25:14.721
               -Okay.
-[rapid fire continues]

25:14.762 --> 25:15.596
            [Henderson]
Are we doing this or what?

25:15.638 --> 25:20.184
        Yeah, I'm on my way.
Look, we can't just hit
some random target.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.895
   We gotta take something else,
that's gonna swing things
in our direction.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.772
     I think I may have found
just the thing.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.316
         [thunder roaring]

25:33.823 --> 25:36.201
      [upbeat music playing]

25:44.917 --> 25:46.294
        Where's the future?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.711
      -[students] Right here.
-[chuckles]

25:47.753 --> 25:49.338
       -Whose life is this?
-[students] Mine.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.965
  What are you gonna do with it?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.800
         [all] Live it by
any means necessary.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.885
             Ah, okay.

25:54.927 --> 25:56.930
    -Okay, that's it for today.
Thank you.
-[school bell rings]

25:58.515 --> 26:00.892
       [indistinct talking]

26:13.028 --> 26:14.530
      So that's still working
for you, huh?

26:16.740 --> 26:17.826
       Thank you for coming.

26:17.866 --> 26:20.244
       Hmm, it's no problem.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.330
     But if you called me here
to talk about Odell
and my work with the ASA,

26:23.373 --> 26:25.709
        I'm telling you now,
it's gonna be
a short conversation.

26:29.712 --> 26:32.339
        Well, in that case,
I'll get right to the point.

26:34.925 --> 26:36.595
     Odell is using you, Jen.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.682
    I mean, you're like a gun,

26:40.723 --> 26:41.849
   and he's pulling the trigger.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.727
          And you're like
that little thing,

26:43.768 --> 26:45.228
   that symbol on the computer,

26:45.269 --> 26:47.188
      the one that just goes
round and round,

26:47.230 --> 26:49.273
      -while you wait for it
to load something new.
-Jen.

26:50.733 --> 26:53.694
   Jen, how do I get you to see
that your powers are a drug?

26:53.737 --> 26:57.740
       And you are addicted.
The more you use them,
the more I lose you.

26:58.907 --> 27:00.367
    The more you lose yourself.

27:02.953 --> 27:04.748
  The people of Freeland need me.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.834
         And you could have
stopped this years ago,

27:07.875 --> 27:10.045
        but your philosophy
and your code,

27:10.086 --> 27:12.422
          it stopped you
and now look where we are.

27:12.463 --> 27:16.343
        So I tell you what,
I'm gonna clean up
this mess you made,

27:16.384 --> 27:18.385
    so that I can finally lead
a normal life.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.471
     Something that you could
never provide for me

27:20.512 --> 27:22.097
          or anyone else,
for that matter.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.309
         A life of peace.

27:30.356 --> 27:32.317
               -Jen.
-It was good seeing you.

27:32.942 --> 27:33.902
               Dad.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.656
       [students chattering]

28:13.316 --> 28:15.442
      Still nothing on what's
turning the skies red, sir.

28:15.484 --> 28:17.319
      We have worse problems
than air quality.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.656
  Black Lightning just destroyed
the ASA headquarters,

28:20.699 --> 28:22.951
   and everything that's in it.

28:22.991 --> 28:27.663
       Which leaves the Pit
as the only operational base
in Freeland.

28:27.705 --> 28:30.165
          -The perimeter?
-It's still intact.

28:30.208 --> 28:34.295
        But I'm gonna make
the assumption that he knows
where the Pit is located.

28:34.336 --> 28:36.923
         He won't attack us
because he's weak-minded,

28:36.964 --> 28:41.885
   and won't want to fight metas
that we've trained for fear
of killing them.

28:41.927 --> 28:45.306
         So his next move
is to find the camp,

28:45.347 --> 28:46.266
            and release
the detainees.

28:46.307 --> 28:50.561
      I'll triple the amount
of ASA commandos and make sure
the camp is secure.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.565
        That won't suffice.

28:53.605 --> 28:58.361
   Send a shipment of Green Light
and brain implants to the camp.

28:58.403 --> 29:03.115
  We'll get there before he does,
and weaponize the detainees.

29:03.157 --> 29:04.867
       Fight fire with fire.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.786
          -The detainees?
-Yeah.

29:06.827 --> 29:08.829
     They haven't been trained
for active duty, sir.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.623
         They're just kids,
fresh off the street.

29:10.664 --> 29:13.625
     Not for long. Dismissed.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.759
      [hip hop music playing]

29:46.910 --> 29:48.494
      So much for restraint.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.079
  Hmm. They served their purpose.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.833
      Killing all of the metas
was not part of your mission.

29:53.875 --> 29:57.086
    These metas helped you win
the war against Markovia.

29:57.127 --> 29:59.506
  No Markovians, no need for war.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.049
    No war, no need for metas.

30:02.090 --> 30:03.300
    Except for you, of course.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.428
             [scoffs]

30:05.470 --> 30:07.471
   "Thank you" would be a better
response, Odell.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.349
            Thank you.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.480
  Your loyalty will be rewarded.

30:16.897 --> 30:18.023
        I read somewhere...

30:19.400 --> 30:22.194
        Some people are not
loyal to you.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.154
           They are loyal
to their need of you.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.865
   And once their needs change,

30:27.659 --> 30:28.785
      so does their loyalty.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.202
           That's true.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.836
      You know, your family's
gonna come for you.

30:38.877 --> 30:39.796
             [scoffs]

30:41.548 --> 30:42.840
     That's what family's for.

30:43.298 --> 30:45.218
            [chuckles]

30:45.259 --> 30:47.010
        [thunder crashing]

30:50.138 --> 30:51.223
        It's getting worse.

30:51.974 --> 30:53.268
       [Anissa] Uncle Gambi!

30:53.308 --> 30:54.685
              I think
I may have found something.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.313
  I've piggy backed on the ASA's
satellite network.

30:57.355 --> 31:00.567
  Whenever there's a marked rise
in anti-matter particles
in the atmosphere,

31:00.607 --> 31:03.443
          Jen phases away
to God knows where.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.319
      Okay. But can you stop
her from phasing?

31:04.362 --> 31:07.740
      I'm gonna keep looking.
Hopefully, I can get her
to just stay here.

31:07.781 --> 31:09.576
         And if you can't?

31:09.616 --> 31:11.076
   [Anissa] Look, you know what,
it's the ASA.

31:11.118 --> 31:13.663
       I'll go and make them
stop turning the sky red.

31:13.704 --> 31:15.957
     Anissa, the ASA has lots
of capabilities,

31:15.999 --> 31:18.459
    but generating anti-matter
isn't one of them.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.377
      Yeh, well, I wouldn't be
so quick to put it past them,

31:20.420 --> 31:22.297
      considering everything
they're capable of.

31:22.337 --> 31:26.134
        -What do you mean?
-Like bringing people back
from the dead.

31:26.174 --> 31:29.386
   Guys, I saw Khalil last week,
or should I say, Painkiller.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.973
          And he was alive
and they had to be the ones
who brought him back.

31:37.019 --> 31:38.855
            Hello? Mom!

31:38.896 --> 31:41.316
         Did you hear me?
Khalil is still alive.

31:41.356 --> 31:43.317
              I know.

31:43.358 --> 31:45.403
       I saw him when I was
at the Pit, a couple
of weeks ago.

31:45.444 --> 31:47.154
  So you know what we have to do.

31:47.195 --> 31:48.740
    Khalil has to be put down.

31:49.531 --> 31:50.741
     Khalil is not an animal.

31:51.867 --> 31:54.287
            He's a boy
and he needs our help.

31:54.328 --> 31:56.163
      As much as you disagree
with Dad,

31:56.204 --> 31:58.833
      you sound just like him
right now.

31:58.875 --> 32:02.461
     Trust me when I tell you,
he is not Khalil anymore.

32:02.502 --> 32:03.837
       He is something else.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.382
          Something cruel
and just plain dangerous.

32:06.423 --> 32:10.219
    Hey, guys, look, Khalil...
Painkiller is the least
of our worries right now.

32:10.260 --> 32:12.180
       I've just intercepted
an encrypted message

32:12.221 --> 32:15.182
       from the ASA servers
in the Pit.

32:15.223 --> 32:17.852
     Odell has just dispatched
a truckload of Green Light

32:17.894 --> 32:19.269
   to the detainees of the camp.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.688
             [exhales]

32:20.730 --> 32:22.356
             He's gonna
weaponize those kids.

32:22.397 --> 32:23.231
       The ASA is desperate.

32:23.273 --> 32:27.694
     Desperate enough to make
and unleash unstable
now metas on Freeland.

32:27.737 --> 32:28.738
            That's it.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.200
             -Shonda?
-[Shonda] Yes, Anissa.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.952
       Call Black Lightning.

32:34.993 --> 32:37.579
              You're connected.
-[Black Lightning]
What's going on?

32:37.622 --> 32:38.873
          Jennifer okay?

32:38.914 --> 32:39.832
     Look, it's getting worse.

32:39.832 --> 32:43.877
    Whatever you and Henderson
are doing to piss off the ASA,
it's working.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.090
       Listen to me, the ASA
is sending a shipment
of Green Light

32:48.132 --> 32:49.634
    to the detainment facility

32:49.675 --> 32:52.095
       to weaponize the kids
to use against the resistance.

32:52.135 --> 32:54.972
         I have the route
that they're traveling
to the facility.

32:55.013 --> 32:57.849
               Good.
And I have a plan to stop it.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.688
        [thunder rumbling]

33:06.150 --> 33:08.653
     [dramatic music playing]

33:20.832 --> 33:21.915
     Tell me you didn't do it.

33:24.042 --> 33:25.211
    All those innocent people.

33:25.252 --> 33:29.048
     Ugh, don't be naive, Dad.
No one's innocent.

33:29.548 --> 33:31.592
              What...

33:31.634 --> 33:33.552
    It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

33:33.594 --> 33:34.761
   Well, why don't I remind you.

33:35.887 --> 33:38.141
      I'm the girl that just
ended a war,

33:38.182 --> 33:41.102
           by doing what
you wouldn't because
of your personal morality.

33:41.144 --> 33:44.689
     I'm the girl that didn't
just stand by
and watch Freeland die,

33:44.730 --> 33:46.441
       because of some rules
no one lives by,

33:46.481 --> 33:47.567
             -but you.
-No.

33:49.317 --> 33:53.573
        No. You're the girl
who's standing
in her father's house,

33:53.614 --> 33:56.992
    with nothing but disrespect
and contempt in her mouth.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.287
    You are the girl who chose
not to listen to her father,

33:59.327 --> 34:00.496
     instead, listen to Odell.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.374
            And became
a cold-blooded murderer.

34:03.415 --> 34:05.460
    That's where you're wrong.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.295
          I listen to me,
because no one controls me.

34:08.336 --> 34:11.590
       No one can. Not you,
not Odell, nobody.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.889
     [Jefferson] This has gone
too far, Jen.

34:19.014 --> 34:22.434
        We can't just look
the other way anymore.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.978
        Jen, this is wrong.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.356
     [chuckles] What is this?

34:27.398 --> 34:29.983
       Huh? An intervention,
or something?

34:30.025 --> 34:31.568
    You have to stop this, Jen.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.489
   You have to turn yourself in.

34:34.530 --> 34:38.076
             -To who?
-To the authorities.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.659
  You still don't get it, do you?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.579
        I am the authority.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.583
       [Jefferson] Jennifer.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.585
         Turn yourself in.

34:50.713 --> 34:51.797
             Make me.

35:04.518 --> 35:06.394
           Jen, come on,

35:06.436 --> 35:08.188
         it does not have
to be this way.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.856
      We are still a family.

35:09.898 --> 35:13.235
      Let's all just sit down
and talk about this.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.570
      Nah, you all are weak.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.199
      He has to wear a suit.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.576
   You have to hold your breath
and Mom...

35:20.617 --> 35:23.621
  [scoffs] Honestly, I don't need
to talk about a damn thing.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.206
   Come on, Jen, listen to me...

35:26.248 --> 35:28.626
         -[Anissa grunts]
-It's hard to hold your breath
when you're distracted, huh?

35:32.838 --> 35:34.548
      [upbeat music playing]

35:40.096 --> 35:41.389
          [Jefferson] No!

35:41.429 --> 35:43.306
      [electricity crackling]

35:44.266 --> 35:45.184
               Lynn!

35:47.769 --> 35:48.980
    It's just you and me, Dad.

35:50.313 --> 35:51.398
       It's just you and me.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.568
           [both grunt]

35:54.610 --> 35:55.777
        Where's the future?

35:56.903 --> 35:57.864
             [grunts]

35:58.530 --> 36:00.699
       Oh, it's right here.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.784
             [groans]

36:02.827 --> 36:04.744
     -And whose life is this?
-[groans]

36:05.538 --> 36:06.914
            It's mine!

36:06.956 --> 36:10.041
     Look at me, Dad! This is
the best part, look at me!

36:10.083 --> 36:11.460
           Jennifer, no!

36:11.501 --> 36:12.586
             [gasping]

36:12.628 --> 36:14.172
    And how you gonna live it?

36:15.547 --> 36:16.590
             [exhales]

36:16.632 --> 36:19.177
          Oh, you won't.

36:20.594 --> 36:21.596
            But I will.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.432
      By any means necessary.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.518
      [upbeat music playing]

36:39.155 --> 36:40.239
              [sighs]

36:51.751 --> 36:53.543
        [thunder rumbling]

36:54.545 --> 36:55.713
                No!

36:57.340 --> 36:59.592
     Gambi, what's happening?

36:59.634 --> 37:01.427
          -I don't know.
-Do something.

37:11.938 --> 37:12.896
              [gasps]

37:15.315 --> 37:16.233
       How could you do it?

37:18.860 --> 37:21.697
      -[Evil Jennifer grunts]
-How could you do that
to your own family?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.199
  Bitch, you have lost your mind.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.742
       [Electric crackling]

37:25.867 --> 37:27.369
        -[Jennifer grunts]
-Whoa, stop.

37:27.786 --> 37:29.496
             [grunts]

37:30.664 --> 37:32.875
          [both grunting]

37:32.916 --> 37:35.168
       Hey, hey, stop, stop.

37:35.210 --> 37:36.670
          [both grunting]

37:37.505 --> 37:39.090

37:39.130 --> 37:40.632
         [effort grunting]

37:42.550 --> 37:43.260
           Please, stop.

37:43.302 --> 37:47.014
  I need to know what's going on,
and this is not helping.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.016
        [breathing heavily]

37:51.936 --> 37:53.521
  [Lightning] Something happened
in my Freeland.

37:53.561 --> 37:56.065
     It was like a red storm,
like you said,

37:56.106 --> 37:58.900
        and it changed me.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.737
  And I'm sorry, I tried to help
our father, but I couldn't do
or say anything.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.824
     -I was just gotten there.
-Okay, yada, yada, yada.

38:04.864 --> 38:08.369
      This don't mean anything
to me because I don't believe
any of it.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.038
         This is obviously
a Markovian trick, ladies.

38:11.079 --> 38:12.873
     But here you are, though.

38:12.914 --> 38:14.333
       And I'm sure you saw
the storm too.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.793
        Can the Markovians
control the weather?

38:15.835 --> 38:19.130
         Okay, so [sighs]
what you're saying is,

38:19.170 --> 38:21.798
   -we're from different worlds?
-[Lightning] Yeah.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.635
     And this storm is pulling
them together somehow.

38:24.677 --> 38:27.512
  It's pulling all of us together
and collapsing them all
into one.

38:27.554 --> 38:29.222
        Or destroying 'em.

38:29.264 --> 38:30.891
  Until only one of us survives.

38:34.519 --> 38:36.313
      You know, I'm just now
realizing something.

38:38.148 --> 38:41.068
   You have way too much power.

38:41.110 --> 38:44.655
         Thank you so much.
And how much is too much?

38:44.697 --> 38:48.617
      Too much when you think
it's okay to kill
your entire family.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.244
  Look at yourself, you let Odell
take your powers

38:51.286 --> 38:55.458
  and turn them into his weapon,
and he almost did the same
thing to me in my world.

38:55.498 --> 38:57.335
         Well, my father,

38:57.376 --> 38:59.295
         look, I know that
his code may be flawed,

38:59.336 --> 39:00.920
           but at least,
it's kept him alive,

39:00.963 --> 39:04.800
  at least it kept his conscience
and his spirit clean.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.594
       Because he warned me
about vengeance.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.262
      He warned me about what
violence can do to
a person's soul.

39:09.304 --> 39:11.931
        And I don't know if
I can come back from that,

39:11.974 --> 39:15.769
        but I can dam sure
avoid being you.

39:15.811 --> 39:19.398
     You know, I used to wish
that my powers would
just go away.

39:20.815 --> 39:22.777
    'Cause I thought everything
would do back to normal

39:22.818 --> 39:25.028
       if I didn't have 'em,
if nobody had 'em.

39:25.070 --> 39:26.405
       But then I realized,

39:27.739 --> 39:30.242
      there is no such thing
as normal.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.869
          And none of us
can be part of it.

39:31.911 --> 39:35.289
    You know, that's real cute,
it is, but what works for you,

39:35.331 --> 39:39.251
     doesn't work in my world,
because I don't know about
y'all,

39:39.293 --> 39:41.503
        but I brought peace
to my Freeland.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.088
        -That's what I did.
-Listen to me.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.132
  I don't know if you can change
what you've done,

39:46.175 --> 39:50.179
  but you don't have anyone left
in your world that loves you
anymore.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.056
       Do you not get that?
That sounds like hell to me.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.726
     And a far cry from peace.

39:56.768 --> 40:00.523
      And you, don't you ever
give up your powers,

40:00.563 --> 40:04.068
  because they're a gift from God
and if he didn't want you
to have 'em,

40:04.110 --> 40:06.152
    I'm telling you he wouldn't
have given them to you.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.614
  And he wouldn't have given them
to your father and your sister.

40:08.655 --> 40:10.574
           My dad told me
that it was okay.

40:10.615 --> 40:14.536
       He said it was okay,
because he knew that
you were gonna do it anyway.

40:14.577 --> 40:18.331
          Okay, I get it.
So, you the woke one
out of all of us here.

40:18.373 --> 40:20.835
   Right? We sleep and you woke.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.295
           What are you,
Glinda the Good Witch
The Wiz?

40:23.336 --> 40:24.170
       Let me clap for you.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.507
        You gonna break out
in song next? You got a dance
to go with it?

40:27.550 --> 40:30.052
        Come on, let's see.
You got this suit,
you're looking cute,

40:30.094 --> 40:31.679
           you just know
what you talking about, huh?

40:31.719 --> 40:33.639
            -[singing]
-What is that?

40:33.681 --> 40:36.641
       What is what, bitch?
You know you always
interrupting somebody?

40:37.309 --> 40:38.601
       Y'all don't see that?

40:38.643 --> 40:40.228
        [singing continues]

40:40.271 --> 40:42.606
         -That white wave.
-White wave of what?

40:51.574 --> 40:53.576
    There's nothing we can do?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.702
       [Gambi] I have tried
everything I know.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.121
             Jennifer,
if you can hear me, fight.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.291
   Fight your way back, please.

41:02.793 --> 41:03.793
            Oh, my God.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.677
            Jefferson!

41:12.719 --> 41:13.637
          Where'd he go?

41:14.429 --> 41:16.681
         [song continues]
