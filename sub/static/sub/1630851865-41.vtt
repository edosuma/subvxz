00:36.680 --> 00:38.040
Hmm.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.320
I've got the soda!

00:39.440 --> 00:41.320
And I've got the candies.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.280
Goggles ready!

00:43.640 --> 00:46.480
OK.
Stand back and get ready for...

00:46.680 --> 00:47.879
the geyser!

00:48.239 --> 00:50.160
Geyser! Geyser!

00:50.360 --> 00:53.720
I'll drop the candies
into the soda and...

00:53.919 --> 00:55.040
Wahooo!

00:55.239 --> 00:56.199
Wow!

00:56.400 --> 00:57.519
I love it!

00:57.640 --> 00:59.959
So <i>that's</i>
what a geyser is like.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.440
Yeah, well, except a real geyser
is a hot spring in the ground.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.399
And it shoots hot water,
not soda.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.000
[giggles]

01:07.200 --> 01:08.240
Fwoosh!

01:08.440 --> 01:11.200
No wonder you want to see
a <i>real </i>geyser, Ollie!

01:11.399 --> 01:13.119
Not just any geyser, Moon.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.119
I want to see one of the most
famous geysers of all:

01:16.320 --> 01:17.160
Old Faithful.

01:17.479 --> 01:19.200
In Yellowstone National Park!

01:19.479 --> 01:20.320
[MOON] Woah.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.000
Now that's a fwoosh geyser.

01:22.119 --> 01:26.119
Plus, it goes <i>fwoosh</i>
at the same time every day!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
Amazing, right?

01:27.520 --> 01:29.240
Yeah! So, what's this?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.200
Oh, this?

01:30.399 --> 01:33.640
It's just, you know, the dream
schedule I've been working on

01:33.839 --> 01:34.759
for when I visit one day.

01:35.119 --> 01:36.880
It's like a rainbow.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.080
You've planned
every single minute of the day.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.000
Uh huh! For maximum fun!

01:42.199 --> 01:43.600
Oh, there's nothing better

01:43.800 --> 01:45.560
than following
a well-planned schedule, Moon!

01:45.759 --> 01:46.720
Eee!

01:48.360 --> 01:49.640
[clears throat]

01:49.759 --> 01:52.640
And look! At the end of the day
is the best part.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.960
A picture in front
of Old Faithful as it erupts!

01:56.280 --> 01:57.399
Fwoosh!

01:57.600 --> 01:59.280
So what are we doing here?

01:59.399 --> 02:00.199
What do you mean?

02:00.600 --> 02:04.559
I mean, why make a geyser
out of soda and candy,

02:04.679 --> 02:07.479
when we can see one in person!
Today!

02:07.600 --> 02:11.079
Moon, we can't possibly go
to Yellowstone <i>today.</i>

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
I haven't packed!

02:12.359 --> 02:15.200
That's what
your emergency backpack is for!

02:15.480 --> 02:16.320
Come on!

02:16.440 --> 02:17.840
Let's go to Yellowstone!

02:17.960 --> 02:20.239

02:47.519 --> 02:49.920
Look at that, Moon!
We're right on schedule!

02:54.120 --> 02:56.840
And now we're behind schedule
thanks to that slow bus.

02:56.959 --> 02:57.760
Hmm.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.400
I'll have to change a few things
on the schedule

03:00.600 --> 03:02.040
if we want to see <i>everything.</i>

03:02.160 --> 03:04.480
<i>And </i>get to Old Faithful
in time for the fwoosh!

03:07.359 --> 03:08.799

03:08.920 --> 03:12.000

03:14.320 --> 03:15.440
Are you looking, Ollie?

03:15.560 --> 03:18.040
I'll just change this and...
What?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.079
Hey! Moon...

03:20.200 --> 03:22.359
Now we're going to be
even more behind!

03:22.480 --> 03:23.720
Hmm.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.480
It'll take forever
to repack our bag.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.799
Sorry, Ollie.

03:28.079 --> 03:30.280
The granola bars
were all the way at the bottom.

03:30.399 --> 03:31.239
Want one?

03:31.440 --> 03:32.239
No!

03:32.359 --> 03:35.280
Snack time isn't scheduled
until 2:15!

03:35.399 --> 03:36.440
Oh...

03:36.560 --> 03:38.560
My tummy did not know that.

03:38.679 --> 03:41.239
Don't worry,
I'll pack you back up!

03:41.760 --> 03:44.040
-Hrm...
-Ugh...

03:45.519 --> 03:47.560

03:47.679 --> 03:49.200
You weren't kidding!

03:49.799 --> 03:52.040
This, uh... is, uh...

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
tough to pack.

03:53.359 --> 03:54.679
Here, Moon! Let me help.

03:54.799 --> 03:55.679
[gasps] Scoot!

03:55.799 --> 03:57.720
Scoot? What are you doing here?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.480
Oh yeah! I forgot to tell you.
I invited Scoot.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.399
It's OK if he comes with us,
right?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.560
Well, sure. Of course.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.560
I just have to...

04:07.760 --> 04:10.000
add one more friend
into the schedule!

04:10.200 --> 04:11.000
Somehow...

04:11.119 --> 04:12.560
One last jump ought to do it!

04:12.679 --> 04:13.519
Hmm.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.560
-Hi-yah!
-Hi-yah!

04:18.519 --> 04:19.360

04:19.560 --> 04:21.279
Oops, sorry.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.039
[gasps]

04:25.240 --> 04:27.520
You packed a back-up backpack?

04:27.719 --> 04:29.440
I always plan for emergencies.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.360
How about I do the packing
this time?

04:34.920 --> 04:37.200
OK. We're finally ready to--

04:37.400 --> 04:39.240
Oh no! That took way too long!

04:39.440 --> 04:42.919
We're supposed to be all the way
to Yellowstone Lake by now!

04:43.120 --> 04:44.280
Don't worry, Ollie.

04:44.479 --> 04:47.120
I can get us there fast!

04:47.320 --> 04:48.280
Wahoo!

04:49.280 --> 04:50.680
Just point the way!

04:50.800 --> 04:52.360
Wahoo!

04:52.479 --> 04:54.440
[MOON] Wahooo!

04:54.800 --> 04:57.800
We should be getting to the road
that goes to the lake soon.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.640
We're looking for it, Ollie.

05:00.599 --> 05:01.599
Hmm.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.520
Woah!

05:03.719 --> 05:06.280
Check out that amazing bird!

05:06.479 --> 05:08.360
I wonder where it's going.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.440
Wheee!

05:09.560 --> 05:12.520
Now just keep to the right and
we should be there any minute.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.800
Uh oh. Where is it?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.200
It should be
right in front of you--

05:20.840 --> 05:22.560
[OLLIE] Huh? Where's the lake?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.360
Ahh.

05:25.479 --> 05:27.520
I guess we missed the turn
when we were following

05:27.719 --> 05:29.280
that amazing bird!

05:29.479 --> 05:32.240
Bird? Bird-following isn't
on the schedule!

05:32.440 --> 05:35.960
[SCOOT] Uh, say, Ollie...
Is this canyon on your schedule?

05:36.159 --> 05:37.479

Oh, wow. That sounds nice.

05:54.039 --> 05:56.039
Sorry we went off schedule,
Ollie.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.440
But, you have to admit
this is pretty cool.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.400
Pretty cool.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.520
But we need to keep moving
if we're going to see everything

06:03.719 --> 06:05.320
and get to Old Faithful on time.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.560
[watch beeps]

06:06.760 --> 06:08.159
And now we're <i>really </i>late!

Scoot's motor--

Wahoo!

06:12.760 --> 06:14.599
I'll be right back...

Where are you?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.359
Don't worry, Ollie.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.680
I bet we can catch up
to Scoot fast.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.280
But how? We don't even know
which road he took.

06:30.479 --> 06:32.840
This is exactly
the kind of thing that happens

06:33.039 --> 06:35.080
when you don't stick
to the schedule!

06:35.280 --> 06:37.479
Come on! We'll try this way.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.719

06:41.919 --> 06:44.560
[gasps] I think I see Scoot!

06:47.719 --> 06:50.080
Hm. Nope, just a roadblock.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.240
So we have to turn around
and go back?

06:52.440 --> 06:55.159
I don't think I've ever been
<i>more </i>behind schedule!

06:55.359 --> 06:56.200
Hmm.

06:56.479 --> 06:59.200
Wait! That's why
the road's blocked, Ollie!

06:59.400 --> 07:01.760

have spotted something.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.039
Huh!

I can't believe
how lucky we are!

-Yeah.

07:22.799 --> 07:24.400
[OLLIE] That was pretty special.

07:24.599 --> 07:26.320
But so were
all these places, Moon!

07:26.520 --> 07:28.000
Especially Old Faithful!

07:28.200 --> 07:30.479
We need to figure out
how to catch up to Scoot!

07:30.599 --> 07:31.520
[OLLIE] Fast!

07:31.719 --> 07:32.760
Don't worry, Ollie.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.960
You can count on me
and my brainstorms.

07:35.080 --> 07:35.919
See that sign?

07:37.039 --> 07:37.880
Yes!

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Scoot has to be
headed that way too!

07:40.200 --> 07:42.000
We'll just ride
and catch up to him.

07:42.120 --> 07:42.960

Isn't this fun?

07:53.960 --> 07:55.560
Shockingly, I'm enjoying it.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.320
The fresh air, the bouncy
but not too bouncy horse...

07:59.520 --> 08:00.400
Still, it's not fast.

08:00.799 --> 08:02.039
And there's so much to do

08:02.239 --> 08:04.080
before we get
to my favorite geyser!

08:04.280 --> 08:05.640
Come on, horsey!

08:11.239 --> 08:13.359
[OLLIE] Faster...

08:13.840 --> 08:16.479
Hey, my schedule!
Give that back!

08:18.280 --> 08:20.239
What? No!

08:20.440 --> 08:21.560
He just ate it.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.080
He <i>ate </i>the best schedule

08:24.280 --> 08:25.320
I ever made!

08:25.440 --> 08:27.120
He must've been <i>really </i>hungry.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.840
But, how am I supposed
to stick to my plan?

08:30.039 --> 08:31.719
How can I have any fun at all?

08:31.919 --> 08:33.439
I need my schedule!

08:33.760 --> 08:35.039
I don't know, Ollie.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.360
Do we need it?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.760
I mean,
we saw an amazing canyon,

08:38.880 --> 08:42.319
a moose with a rainbow,
and we're riding horses!

08:42.520 --> 08:44.680
None of that
was on the schedule.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.800
But...

08:45.920 --> 08:46.840
well...

08:47.600 --> 08:49.000
You're right Moon.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.400
And now that I'm not looking
at the schedule,

08:51.600 --> 08:53.520
there sure is a lot more to see.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.160
Looks like we have a few hours
before Old Faithful goes fwoosh.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.959
What do you say
we catch up to Scoot

09:40.880 --> 09:43.079
We've had so much fun! Have you?

09:43.319 --> 09:44.439
Uh, well...

09:44.800 --> 09:46.280
I found the bird!

09:46.480 --> 09:50.400
But I got lost, hit a pothole
and got a flat tire...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.319
I'm so sorry!

09:53.520 --> 09:55.959
I should never have
gone off schedule...

09:56.160 --> 09:59.199
Believe it or not, Scoot,
I'm glad you did!

09:59.400 --> 10:01.319
So, what do we do now?

10:01.520 --> 10:03.079
I don't know about you guys,

10:03.280 --> 10:06.000
but I want to see
Old Faithful go <i>fwoosh!</i>

10:06.319 --> 10:08.520
But how can we
get there in time?

10:08.720 --> 10:10.880
[rustling around]

10:11.079 --> 10:13.319
What can I say?
Schedule or no schedule,

10:13.520 --> 10:15.959
I always plan for emergencies.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.040
-You saved the day!
-Hehe!

10:18.240 --> 10:19.079
[gasps]

10:19.199 --> 10:20.120
[sighs]

10:26.280 --> 10:27.520
[deep rumbling]

10:27.920 --> 10:30.319
-[SCOOT] Wahoo! Amazing!
-[MOON] Woah! Yay!

10:30.520 --> 10:34.680
I can't believe it erupts
at the same time every day!

10:34.880 --> 10:36.839
Yup. Right on schedule.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.520
[giggles] No wonder it's
your favorite geyser, Ollie!

10:40.720 --> 10:42.280
Say "fwoosh"!

10:42.480 --> 10:43.680
-Fwoosh!
-Fwoosh!

10:46.880 --> 10:49.000
Hey, Ollie.
Want to go to the park?

10:49.199 --> 10:51.480
Hm. Let me check...

10:51.680 --> 10:52.640
Hm, hm, hm.

10:52.839 --> 10:55.000
I think I can squeeze that in.

10:55.199 --> 10:56.439
Going off schedule!

10:56.719 --> 10:58.079
-Wahoo!
-Yay!

10:58.280 --> 10:59.959
[MOON] Let's go! [giggles]
