01:47.310 --> 01:49.510
It's 6:42 a.m.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.350
Beth's Dad's place.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.020
He's out of town.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.020
And it's already a good day.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.890
Beth.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.600
- Rob, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.310
- Well, then stop.
- Nothing.

02:48.390 --> 02:50.350
- That's...
- Stop it.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.850
She's shy.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.190
I could just see this
ending up on the Internet.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.850
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

02:57.930 --> 03:01.020
- I'm interested in other things.
- Like what?

03:05.100 --> 03:06.430
Like you.

03:10.930 --> 03:13.310
- Oh, man.
- That was close.

03:14.270 --> 03:16.810
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.850
- It's only 30 minutes out.
- Shut up. I've never been.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.640
You've never been to Coney Island?

03:20.720 --> 03:22.230
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney Island?

03:22.310 --> 03:24.020
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.020
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.350
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

03:27.430 --> 03:28.510
- Yeah, I can't wait to...
- Give me this.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.850
What are you doing? What?

03:29.930 --> 03:31.680
Oh, all right. Well,
then from the neck up, okay?

03:31.770 --> 03:33.350
That's the only way I consent to this.

03:33.430 --> 03:34.980
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.930
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs. Com, have you?

03:37.020 --> 03:40.100
- Okay. What else?
- What else, what?

03:40.190 --> 03:42.310
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

03:42.390 --> 03:46.310
- What do you want to do today?
- If I answer that...

03:47.640 --> 03:48.890
- All right, is this thing on?
- Look out!

03:48.980 --> 03:50.020
Babe, it's not my camera.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.720
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

03:51.810 --> 03:53.470
All right. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.190
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.810
Is that funny?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.510
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

04:00.600 --> 04:01.640
- It's getting late here.
- A couple hours.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.560
- That's why we have to hurry.
- Where are we going?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.850
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

04:08.560 --> 04:10.140
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

04:10.230 --> 04:12.100
and get testimonials from everyone.

04:12.190 --> 04:14.560
Why? I mean,
it's not like this is a wedding.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.810
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.560
I can't get this.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.100
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

04:22.190 --> 04:24.470
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

04:24.930 --> 04:27.140
- That's what I think is gonna happen.
- No, I'm not!

04:27.230 --> 04:28.510
- You totally are. You...
- You have no clue!

04:28.850 --> 04:30.640
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.100
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.850
Yeah. Got you.

04:34.930 --> 04:37.560
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

04:37.640 --> 04:38.930
You're doing a great job.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.350
Here, practice doing two things at once.

04:41.430 --> 04:43.310
- That's good! That was good.
- Thank you.

04:43.390 --> 04:44.430
I'm not lugging this thing around

04:44.510 --> 04:45.560
- all night long.
- He is your brother.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.720
This is important. Stop freaking out.

04:46.810 --> 04:47.810
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

04:47.890 --> 04:49.600
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

04:49.680 --> 04:51.930
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

04:52.020 --> 04:53.510
- All I want you to do is help me.
- Okay, babe, babe.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.510
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.190
I really pissed her off.

05:00.390 --> 05:03.430
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

05:03.430 --> 05:03.560
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

05:03.980 --> 05:07.470
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

05:08.020 --> 05:09.140
I already have got a job.

05:09.230 --> 05:10.430
- I'm doing the sign, so...
- Yeah, no. I see that,

05:10.510 --> 05:13.510
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

05:13.600 --> 05:15.980
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

05:16.060 --> 05:17.230
No.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.390
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

05:21.470 --> 05:23.310
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.430
I don't know, man.

05:24.510 --> 05:25.810
- That's a lot of responsibility.
- This is important.

05:25.890 --> 05:26.930
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

05:27.020 --> 05:29.020
And Marlena's gonna be here.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.140
- She is?
- Oh, yeah. She is.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.470
- So you're gonna take that.
- Oh, hold on.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.850
- And you're gonna talk to her...
- I didn't...

05:32.930 --> 05:34.640
- For Rob.
- I didn't say I would do it.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.850
- Just try it out.
- All right, I'll do a few.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.060
You can, just do mine...

05:38.140 --> 05:39.310
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go.

05:39.390 --> 05:40.770
All right.

05:41.890 --> 05:44.060
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.310
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

05:46.390 --> 05:48.640
and I'm proud of you.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.350
- That's it.
- That's it?

05:52.430 --> 05:56.600
- Yeah. Easy enough.
- Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.020
- You enjoy it, Hud.
- Thanks, man.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.190
Yeah, I'm doing...

06:02.560 --> 06:03.680
Hey, what's up, man?

06:03.770 --> 06:05.600
Hey, guys? Hey.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
- What do we say?
- Anything.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.100
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

06:12.430 --> 06:15.430
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

06:15.510 --> 06:17.810
- Hud, what are you doing?
- I'm documenting the night.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.640
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.190
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

06:23.270 --> 06:24.390
I've been doing it really well.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.770
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

06:25.850 --> 06:27.230
Because it's really important.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.600
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.720
- Very seriously.
- You promise?

06:30.810 --> 06:33.560
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

06:33.980 --> 06:35.270
- Okay.
- Yeah, do it right now.

06:35.350 --> 06:36.390
Okay.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.060
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

06:38.140 --> 06:40.270
- the last thing he sees you...
- Okay, Hud, I got it.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.100
Robert Hawkins,

06:42.190 --> 06:45.390
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

06:45.470 --> 06:49.470
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

06:49.560 --> 06:52.390
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

06:52.470 --> 06:54.190
- Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
- Dude.

06:54.270 --> 06:56.430
- Okay.
- I'll cut him out later.

06:56.510 --> 07:01.560
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.020
So, you better call us.

07:04.980 --> 07:08.680
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

07:08.770 --> 07:10.680
- Hud?
- Yeah.

07:10.770 --> 07:12.510
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
- That was good!
- That's it?

07:13.680 --> 07:14.720
I thought that was really, really good.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.850
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

07:26.600 --> 07:30.060
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

07:31.470 --> 07:35.270
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.980
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up, dude?

07:43.060 --> 07:44.190
What's up?

07:48.430 --> 07:51.100
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

07:51.190 --> 07:53.140
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hi.

07:53.230 --> 07:54.890
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

07:55.020 --> 07:57.600
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

07:57.680 --> 07:59.980
- Like it's his going-away party.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:00.060 --> 08:05.350
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

08:05.430 --> 08:08.190
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.640
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

08:10.720 --> 08:12.190
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

08:12.270 --> 08:15.140
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

08:15.230 --> 08:18.140
So have you ever been to a wedding?

08:18.230 --> 08:21.390
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

08:21.470 --> 08:24.810
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.059
Okay.

08:33.390 --> 08:35.890
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.720
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

08:39.809 --> 08:42.929
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

08:43.020 --> 08:46.020
so I don't really even know what to say.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.980
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

08:48.060 --> 08:50.310
- Like you're president of something!
- Vice president!

08:50.390 --> 08:51.850
Also really cool.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.020
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

08:55.100 --> 08:58.430
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

08:58.510 --> 09:00.390
- Cool, that was a really good one.
- Yeah?

09:00.470 --> 09:02.140
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.980
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

09:05.060 --> 09:08.230
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

09:08.310 --> 09:09.560
and they like all this video,

09:09.640 --> 09:11.100
- like, bonding crap.
- Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

09:11.190 --> 09:12.850
- I'm not a professional.
- What?

09:12.930 --> 09:15.510
- I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
- Hug?

09:15.600 --> 09:19.140
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

09:19.230 --> 09:22.560
- We met, like, several times before.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.680
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

09:24.770 --> 09:26.510
- it's probably why I didn't...
- Okay, here. If I move it?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.770
- Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
- Yeah.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.640
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.810
- Really good to see you. Really good.
- So what have you been up to?

09:34.890 --> 09:37.060
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

09:37.140 --> 09:38.390
but good luck with the...

09:38.470 --> 09:41.100
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

09:41.190 --> 09:41.350
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.980
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.850
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

09:50.930 --> 09:53.190
Surprise! Surprise!

09:56.720 --> 09:58.470
No, no, no, no, no, no!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.270
How did you guys plan all this?

10:02.350 --> 10:04.810
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

10:04.890 --> 10:06.430
- Hey. How are you?
- Take this. Take this.

10:06.510 --> 10:08.680
- I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
- What's up?

10:08.770 --> 10:10.930
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.310
- What's up, man?
- Speech!

10:12.390 --> 10:15.470
- Yeah, speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

10:18.850 --> 10:21.310
- Oh, this is very surprising...
- I hope so.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.060
- Obviously.
- It's a surprise party.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.390
Yeah.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.600
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

10:28.680 --> 10:29.770
It was everyone. It was everyone.

10:29.850 --> 10:33.270
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

10:33.350 --> 10:37.190
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.060
- Have a good time!
- Yeah, party!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.350
Yeah!

10:41.640 --> 10:46.850
- Hey, man. Were you surprised?
- Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

10:46.930 --> 10:48.770
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

10:48.850 --> 10:52.430
I don't know. I would say blasÃ©.
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

10:52.510 --> 10:55.980
- No, you're not. Well, congrats.
- No, man, that was awesome, dude.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.470
What are you doing
with the video camera

10:57.560 --> 10:58.640
- by the way?
- I'm documenting the night

10:58.720 --> 11:00.230
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

11:00.310 --> 11:01.390
Oh, can I watch it every night

11:01.470 --> 11:02.470
- when I get there?
- Jason asked if I...

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
- Yeah, you could.
- Oh, good.

11:04.140 --> 11:06.470
All right, thank you. Cool.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.980
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

11:10.060 --> 11:13.560
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.350
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

11:29.430 --> 11:31.140
- He's like your main dude.
- Yeah, I know.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.810
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

11:32.890 --> 11:35.510
- I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
- Straight up.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.140
- As I make my... I'm not here.
- Hi, Hud.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.350
I'm just documenting. Not here.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.020
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

11:45.100 --> 11:47.850
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady...

11:47.930 --> 11:50.850
- I love My Fair Lady.
- I was like, "Really?"

11:50.930 --> 11:54.020
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

11:54.100 --> 11:57.510
Beth, hey! You made it.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.230
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.390
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.100
- Enjoy it. Have fun.
- Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

12:05.140 --> 12:06.560
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know. He's random.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.230
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.310
Oh, thanks.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.560
- I missed your surprise.
- Oh, that's okay.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.810
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

12:14.890 --> 12:16.470
- That's fine.
- Decorating's mine.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.680
- No, that's fantastic.
- Rob, this is Travis.

12:19.770 --> 12:20.890
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, pleasure.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.350
I've heard a lot about you.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.980
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.510
- Vice President. That's fantastic.
- I love your dress.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.930
- Thank you. I love yours.
- Yeah, thank you.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.680
That's really amazing.

12:28.770 --> 12:29.890
- Should we...
- Yeah, there's a buffet.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.930
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.270
- Okay.
- So, there's tons of sake.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.140
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.560
- Enjoy, everybody.
- It's good to meet you.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.560
- Have a good one, yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.060
- I think he just said I was cute.
- Are they dating?

12:42.140 --> 12:43.310
Yeah.

13:04.470 --> 13:07.190
- Hey, is everything cool, man?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.560
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

13:10.640 --> 13:12.720
Is that my camera?

13:12.810 --> 13:14.270
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

13:14.350 --> 13:16.600
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.720
I don't know. Was...

13:18.020 --> 13:20.430
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

13:20.510 --> 13:23.560
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

13:25.770 --> 13:27.140
- Rob, why?
- No, it doesn't matter.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.230
It doesn't... It's stupid.

13:29.310 --> 13:31.640
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.890
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

13:35.390 --> 13:39.140
- Here. Here, man. Come on.
- All right, cool. That's more like it.

13:39.230 --> 13:41.720
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.980
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

13:45.060 --> 13:48.810
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

13:48.890 --> 13:53.770
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

13:53.850 --> 13:54.980
Come on, he's leaving.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.350
- I mean, can we...
- I know.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.770
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.230
Isn't there something you wanna say?

14:03.020 --> 14:04.890
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

14:04.980 --> 14:06.850
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is that... Okay.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.470
Cool, thanks.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.850
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

14:11.930 --> 14:13.510
- No, we can do it in the kitchen.
- Okay, perfect.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.720
Okay.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.810
Okay.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.270
Rob,

14:23.510 --> 14:26.100
I didn't want to do this on camera.

14:26.680 --> 14:32.600
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

14:33.350 --> 14:36.390
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

14:36.470 --> 14:39.190
and I know how much it means
to you and...

14:41.430 --> 14:43.680
And I'm really gonna miss you.

14:44.060 --> 14:46.980
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

14:53.190 --> 14:57.190
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.390
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious. They're right outside.

14:59.470 --> 15:02.350
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

15:02.350 --> 15:02.430
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.930
You never even called me, Rob!

15:04.020 --> 15:05.560
You go and bring some guy to my party?

15:05.640 --> 15:07.890
Hold on! You haven't
talked to me in weeks!

15:08.680 --> 15:09.680
- Hud, man! Come on!
- Sorry!

15:09.770 --> 15:12.140
- What? What?
- I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

15:12.230 --> 15:15.060
- But I'm documenting!
- Not this.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.890
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

15:17.980 --> 15:19.810
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily!

15:19.890 --> 15:21.020
I'm not telling you.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.720
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

15:23.810 --> 15:24.810
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.980
- Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
- I'm positive. I promise.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.930
- We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
- She's in the kitchen.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.980
- What?
- Lil!

15:31.850 --> 15:33.350
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

15:33.470 --> 15:34.560
- No.
- You do, don't you?

15:34.640 --> 15:35.600
- What? No.
- Hud, you're a genius.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.930
- You're dodging the question right now.
- There is nothing to tell you.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.060
- Nothing.
- Liar.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.810
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

15:40.890 --> 15:41.930
- No.
- Look at me.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.140
- Lily.
- I know you. Babe.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.470
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.850
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

15:48.930 --> 15:50.430
Why would we say anything?

15:50.510 --> 15:52.060
- We won't say anything.
- Rob and Beth slept together.

15:52.140 --> 15:53.810
- Are you serious?
- It happened a few weeks ago.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.390
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.470
Are you kidding me, Lily?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.230
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

15:58.310 --> 16:01.600
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

16:01.890 --> 16:03.720
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

16:03.810 --> 16:06.510
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.390
- I knew it.
- Are you kidding me?

16:08.470 --> 16:10.510
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

16:11.190 --> 16:12.230
Hey, Marlena.

16:12.310 --> 16:13.680
- It's me, Hud, from before.
- Hi. Right.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.430
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

16:16.510 --> 16:18.100
- No.
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?

16:18.190 --> 16:19.270
- They've been friends forever.
- Crazy.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.430
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.980
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

16:25.060 --> 16:28.020
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

16:28.560 --> 16:29.810
- They did. They had sexual intercourse.
- What?

16:29.890 --> 16:30.980
- Lily told me.
- No way.

16:31.060 --> 16:32.140
- No, you are so...
- No, I promise.

16:32.230 --> 16:33.270
Why do you make up stuff like that?

16:33.350 --> 16:34.680
- No, I do not. I have a nice car.
- You make shit up.

16:34.770 --> 16:36.640
I didn't say what kind...

16:36.720 --> 16:37.930
Hey.

16:46.390 --> 16:50.190
- Good luck in Japan, Rob.
- Good luck tonight, Travis.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.230
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

16:56.310 --> 16:58.140
- Hey. Come on.
- This is not the time, Hud.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.470
- What is it, man?
- Let him go.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.350
- We should talk to him.
- We're not talking to him.

17:01.430 --> 17:02.680
I could talk to him now.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.390
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

17:04.470 --> 17:06.849
...have to do something.
- No. Everyone needs to just calm down

17:06.930 --> 17:08.020
- and give him space.
- He's just gonna stay

17:08.099 --> 17:09.849
- locked in his room all night?
- Lily, look at you.

17:09.930 --> 17:11.640
- It's fine, trust me.
- It is not fine.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.349
- It is fine.
- You are his brother.

17:13.430 --> 17:16.770
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

17:16.849 --> 17:19.430
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

17:19.510 --> 17:20.980
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

17:21.060 --> 17:23.020
- You're not doing any talking.
- Okay, cool.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.190
We got to talk.

17:24.270 --> 17:25.270
You don't know
what you're talking about,

17:25.349 --> 17:27.510
- all right?
- Okay, well, then tell me.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.850
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.190
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

17:32.270 --> 17:33.680
- you totally blew her off.
- I didn't blow her off!

17:33.770 --> 17:34.810
She said you never called her.

17:34.890 --> 17:37.390
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

17:37.470 --> 17:39.100
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.600
Look, there's no "together." It's just
her and me, two separate things.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.810
It's better if we just stay friends.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.560
...not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

17:45.640 --> 17:47.600
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.310
You're not good enough for her.

17:49.390 --> 17:52.230
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

17:52.310 --> 17:55.980
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

17:56.060 --> 18:00.060
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

18:00.140 --> 18:02.390
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.

18:02.470 --> 18:07.190
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

18:07.270 --> 18:10.470
- Like, right now, as you are.
- And you're in love with her.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.230
- But you got to go after her.
- It's not that simple.

18:12.310 --> 18:14.560
- No, it is that simple, Rob.
- Come on, man. Don't be scared.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.850
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

18:16.930 --> 18:19.230
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

18:19.310 --> 18:21.890
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.930
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What the hell was that?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.720
That scared the shit out of me.

18:32.810 --> 18:35.390
Lil! Lil!

18:35.470 --> 18:37.270
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.430
- You guys...
- Lil, where are you?

18:38.510 --> 18:40.270
- What was that?
- What was that?

18:40.350 --> 18:41.850
- Hey. Are you all right?
- Oh, my God.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.270
- Yeah, that was really scary.
- Did you see anything?

18:43.350 --> 18:46.060
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

18:46.140 --> 18:47.310
Guys, look out!

18:48.270 --> 18:49.430
- Okay.
- It was like a bomb.

18:49.510 --> 18:51.600
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.770
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

18:53.850 --> 18:55.020
-But now, just approximately...
- Shut up, shut up.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.600
...15 minutes after word...
- Guys! Come on.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.100
... of a possible earthquake
in lower Manhattan.

19:00.190 --> 19:05.470
Nearby, in New York Harbor, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

19:05.560 --> 19:09.060
in the middle of the harbor
near the Statue of Liberty.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.600
-Once again...
- Dude, that's really close.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.850
...there's no way to know if any...
- That's really, really close.

19:12.930 --> 19:14.850
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

19:14.930 --> 19:17.430
- I don't know. Maybe.
- J, wanna go to the roof?

19:17.510 --> 19:18.680
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

19:18.770 --> 19:19.980
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

19:20.060 --> 19:23.190
- Yeah, let's go up there.
- I don't think we should.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.810
- No!
- That was really...

19:25.810 --> 19:25.930
- No!
- That was really...

19:27.310 --> 19:29.310
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

19:29.390 --> 19:32.310
- It's insane, man.
- Watch your step.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.310
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.060
- Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
- Is this the only lights that went out?

19:46.140 --> 19:47.720
- I think they blew up the trains.
- No, a couple did.

19:47.810 --> 19:52.140
- Some stayed on.
- Oh, man. What is going on?

19:52.230 --> 19:54.310
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

19:54.390 --> 19:55.680
Shut up.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.560
Oh, my God!

20:00.720 --> 20:01.890
No, no, no.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.890
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:08.390 --> 20:10.470
Hud. Move. Hud!

20:25.980 --> 20:27.850
Oh, God.

20:28.770 --> 20:32.310
- Rob, you got a set of keys?
- Get out of here!

20:33.430 --> 20:34.930
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

20:35.020 --> 20:37.720
- Did anybody see Jason or not?
- I don't know.

20:37.810 --> 20:40.850
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

20:40.930 --> 20:43.770
- Did anybody see Jason?
- Is he inside?

20:48.020 --> 20:51.140
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

20:51.230 --> 20:53.190
Oh, Jesus Christ!

20:53.270 --> 20:57.560
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:59.850 --> 21:01.310
Oh, my God!

21:12.640 --> 21:14.720
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

21:14.810 --> 21:16.020
I'm telling you!

21:16.100 --> 21:17.930
- I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

21:25.850 --> 21:29.470
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

21:42.470 --> 21:44.560
Go! Let's go!

21:48.720 --> 21:52.470
- Hey, get down! Get down!
- You all right? You all right?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.060
Yeah, did you guys see that?

21:54.140 --> 21:57.560
- Did you guys see that?
- You all right?

22:01.230 --> 22:03.390
There are people still out there.

22:12.890 --> 22:16.350
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

22:17.560 --> 22:19.100
- Rob.
- What?

22:19.190 --> 22:20.140
- Rob, I saw it!
- What?

22:20.230 --> 22:22.350
- What's he saying?
- It's alive.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.600
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

22:42.930 --> 22:44.560
He's going away now.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.020
- Jason, what are you doing?
- Jason, where are you going?

22:47.100 --> 22:48.770
Lily, just wait.

22:50.270 --> 22:52.100
- Jason, don't go out...
- Jason, don't!

22:52.190 --> 22:53.510
Lily, just wait here!

22:53.600 --> 22:55.680
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

22:55.770 --> 22:58.680
- Jason!
- Rob. Rob!

23:19.640 --> 23:22.510
- Oh, my God. Marlena?
- Oh, God.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.020
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

23:46.980 --> 23:49.230
It walked right through
that street over there.

23:49.310 --> 23:51.850
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.060
- What?
- That's the sound it's making.

23:55.140 --> 23:57.350
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

23:57.430 --> 23:59.720
- You said it was alive? What was it?
- Who cares what it...

23:59.810 --> 24:03.510
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.640
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

24:05.720 --> 24:08.890
- Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
- Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

24:09.060 --> 24:10.310
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

24:10.390 --> 24:11.930
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.430
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

24:13.510 --> 24:16.390
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

24:18.100 --> 24:21.350
- It'll be fine.
- Do you really think I should go?

24:22.190 --> 24:23.230
- Oh, my God.
- That makes no sense.

24:23.310 --> 24:26.100
- That makes no sense.
- Did you see it?

24:26.190 --> 24:28.310
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

24:28.390 --> 24:30.810
It was like... Did you see that thing?

24:30.890 --> 24:32.930
- I'm not yelling at you, all right?
- Yes, you are!

24:33.020 --> 24:34.930
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

24:35.020 --> 24:37.470
- Quiet, guys.
- All right. Come on, just shut up!

24:37.560 --> 24:40.310
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

24:40.390 --> 24:42.680
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

24:42.770 --> 24:44.430
- Now.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:44.510 --> 24:46.230
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.270
- It's a straight shot to Delancey.
- Just take the Williamsburg.

24:48.350 --> 24:50.310
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

24:50.390 --> 24:52.930
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.980
- Center Street's like a block away.
- What's going on?

24:55.060 --> 24:57.680
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

24:57.770 --> 25:00.470
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

25:00.560 --> 25:03.470
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.310
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

25:07.720 --> 25:08.720
Okay, come here.

25:08.810 --> 25:11.510
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- I don't think... Don't even look.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.390
- Is anyone's phone working?
- What?

25:18.470 --> 25:19.930
- Hud, is your phone working?
- What?

25:20.020 --> 25:22.600
- No...
- Shit! I left it in the apartment.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.190
- There's no signal.
- You're not getting a signal either?

25:24.270 --> 25:25.640
No, no, come on.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.470
- Hud, come on!
- What? Okay.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.270
It's all right.

25:39.390 --> 25:40.430
Let's go.

25:40.770 --> 25:41.770
We need an IV.

25:41.850 --> 25:43.020
- Calm down, please.
- Let's go, people.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.390
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Excuse me, Officer.

25:44.470 --> 25:46.060
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

25:46.140 --> 25:47.720
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.680
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

25:50.770 --> 25:53.140
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

25:53.230 --> 25:56.140
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

25:56.230 --> 25:57.980
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

25:58.060 --> 26:01.350
- Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
- Not now, Hud.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.600
Sorry.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.270
Please go in an orderly manner.

26:11.350 --> 26:14.140
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

26:14.230 --> 26:16.890
- Just keep going.
- Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.020
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.770
She has a condo. She's out of town.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.140
I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

26:32.140 --> 26:34.470
There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side...

26:35.310 --> 26:40.640
Get across the bridge.
Move in a quick and orderly fashion.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.430
- You still filming?
- Yeah.

26:52.510 --> 26:55.680
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

26:56.510 --> 26:58.430
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

26:58.510 --> 27:00.060
No, that wouldn't work.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.640
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.310
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.390
- Beth? Beth?
- Rob!

27:08.810 --> 27:12.350
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

27:12.680 --> 27:16.470
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

27:17.770 --> 27:19.720
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

27:19.810 --> 27:21.020
Lily!

27:22.350 --> 27:24.560
- What?
- Rob got a hold of Beth.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.560
Wait! Jason, wait!

27:26.720 --> 27:28.720
- Rob's got Beth on the phone!
- What'd you say?

27:28.810 --> 27:30.890
- What?
- Hey, y'all, come on.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.600
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

27:32.680 --> 27:35.510
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

27:35.600 --> 27:38.850
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

27:39.310 --> 27:41.770
- What?
-I repeat, no panicking.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.230
Did you see it?

28:05.470 --> 28:08.100
- Jason!
- Can you see anything?

28:08.190 --> 28:09.640
No, I can't get over there!

28:09.720 --> 28:11.930
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

28:12.020 --> 28:13.680
Jason!

28:13.770 --> 28:15.850
- Why did you stop?
- Jason!

28:15.930 --> 28:17.980
- What?
- Jason, watch out!

28:23.890 --> 28:27.930
Jason! No, Jason! No!

28:31.100 --> 28:32.350
Jason!

28:33.640 --> 28:38.310
- No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
- Lily, come on!

28:38.390 --> 28:39.930
Jason! No!

28:57.640 --> 28:59.680
Go, go, go, go!

29:26.100 --> 29:31.350
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.430
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

29:33.510 --> 29:36.350
- I don't know.
- I mean, it came out of nowhere!

29:36.470 --> 29:38.060
And he was there
and then he was gone!

29:38.140 --> 29:41.770
- My God! Jason! Jason!
- Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

29:41.850 --> 29:45.190
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

29:45.270 --> 29:49.720
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

29:52.390 --> 29:55.230
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

29:57.560 --> 30:00.470
- Rob. Rob, dude.
- We can't stay here.

30:00.980 --> 30:03.890
- We can't.
- Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

30:03.980 --> 30:07.190
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

30:07.270 --> 30:08.810
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

30:08.890 --> 30:10.640
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.140
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

30:13.230 --> 30:16.390
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

30:16.470 --> 30:19.980
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

30:21.100 --> 30:24.230
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

30:26.230 --> 30:27.810
Do you know? Hey!

30:29.060 --> 30:32.060
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

30:32.680 --> 30:34.060
- No.
- Rob!

30:34.140 --> 30:36.140
- My battery's dead.
- Yeah, dude, I...

30:36.230 --> 30:39.020
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

30:39.100 --> 30:40.310
- Rob! Rob!
- Well, where's he going?

30:40.390 --> 30:41.890
Where are you going?

30:41.980 --> 30:44.640
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

30:46.190 --> 30:50.850
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

30:52.560 --> 30:53.890
Hey, Rob.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.350
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

30:57.430 --> 30:59.720
- Rob, Rob!
...burning right now.

31:00.060 --> 31:03.770
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians traveling across.

31:03.850 --> 31:05.100
-It has collapsed.
- Holy shit.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.100
No word on injuries yet, but...

31:09.100 --> 31:10.560
Oh, God.

31:13.930 --> 31:16.560
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.470
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.770
For those of you just joining us,

31:21.850 --> 31:24.470
lower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

31:24.560 --> 31:26.190
in what has been...

31:31.680 --> 31:34.720
This is a mandatory evacuation.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.230
Proceed south immediately.

31:37.310 --> 31:40.600
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

31:40.680 --> 31:45.560
This is a mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

31:45.640 --> 31:46.980
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

31:47.060 --> 31:49.190
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

31:49.270 --> 31:50.430
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

31:50.510 --> 31:53.930
serious shit going on outside!
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

31:54.020 --> 31:56.980
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

31:58.350 --> 31:59.560
Donna Martel is near the scene
at City Hall.

31:59.640 --> 32:00.890
What's going on?

32:00.980 --> 32:02.890
Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?

32:02.980 --> 32:06.230
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

32:06.310 --> 32:09.770
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilization

32:09.850 --> 32:11.140
of troops and equipment,

32:11.230 --> 32:13.100
and they're trying to get everyone
to leave the area...

32:13.190 --> 32:15.350
To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.720
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.980
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris...

32:20.060 --> 32:21.720
It looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

32:21.810 --> 32:23.560
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.930
There are pieces falling
all over the street.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.770
- Oh, my God.
-Whatever they are, they are moving.

32:27.850 --> 32:28.890
-Oh, my God! They're...
-Donna!

32:28.980 --> 32:30.060
-They're right there!
- Oh, shit.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.100
-Donna, can you hear us?
- Hey!

32:32.190 --> 32:34.270
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

32:34.350 --> 32:35.390
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

32:35.470 --> 32:36.680
- Rob! Rob!
- I've been trying to do that!

32:36.770 --> 32:38.510
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

32:38.600 --> 32:41.350
- The military's evacuating everyone.
- Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

32:41.430 --> 32:42.560
We gotta get out of here.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.060
- It's time to leave the electronics store.
- Rob, come on. We got to go.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.430
- Just come on. Let's go...
- Just stop it!

32:46.510 --> 32:48.060
Okay? Stop, wait!

32:48.770 --> 32:51.190
To listen to your messages...

32:53.680 --> 32:59.350
Rob! Rob! I can't...
Oh, God! I can't move.

33:01.060 --> 33:04.680
It fell. My apartment...
The whole wall fell on me!

33:06.100 --> 33:10.060
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.

33:10.470 --> 33:12.140
Oh, my God.

33:15.430 --> 33:17.640
Help me, Rob.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.100
To delete this message...

33:33.770 --> 33:35.350
Rob, wait up! Rob!

33:35.430 --> 33:37.850
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

33:37.890 --> 33:40.390
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

33:40.470 --> 33:43.850
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

33:43.930 --> 33:45.190
- Guess what else is that way?
- Will you wait up?

33:45.270 --> 33:47.680
- Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
- This is insane, okay?

33:47.770 --> 33:49.640
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

33:49.720 --> 33:51.510
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

33:51.600 --> 33:53.230
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

33:53.310 --> 33:55.140
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

33:55.230 --> 33:56.560
Let them escort you out of here.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.770
Okay?

33:58.350 --> 34:00.100
- Rob!
- I'm sorry. I got to go.

34:00.190 --> 34:01.680
Rob!

34:01.770 --> 34:03.930
- Rob! Listen!
- Rob, wait a minute!

34:04.020 --> 34:05.640
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

34:05.720 --> 34:08.270
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

34:08.350 --> 34:09.679
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

34:09.770 --> 34:13.350
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

34:13.429 --> 34:14.469
And you can't talk me out of it.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.100
- So turn around, go...
- I'm coming.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.639
I'm coming with you.

34:20.469 --> 34:21.719
Lily, you don't have to do that.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.929
- No, I want to. I'm coming.
- Guys, did you not hear her message?

34:25.020 --> 34:26.810
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

34:26.889 --> 34:28.770
- that she's already...
- Shut up.

34:33.719 --> 34:34.929
Guys, this is insane.

34:35.020 --> 34:37.600
- Rob!
- You know what I'm talking about, right?

34:37.679 --> 34:38.980
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.190
Rob! Rob!

34:40.270 --> 34:42.270
- Rob!
- Hey... Hold...

34:44.810 --> 34:46.889
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.850
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

34:50.389 --> 34:51.980
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.560
- Hud!
- I'm so sorry.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.230
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

34:55.310 --> 34:57.270
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

34:57.350 --> 34:59.100
- see if somebody else can get there?
- Yeah, I tried!

34:59.190 --> 35:01.600
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

35:01.680 --> 35:04.810
- I couldn't get through! I tried, I...
- Okay, it just seems a little...

35:06.680 --> 35:09.230
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God!

35:38.720 --> 35:40.640
Oh! Oh, my God.

35:45.470 --> 35:47.470
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

35:49.140 --> 35:53.190
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

36:00.980 --> 36:03.980
- Hud! We're gonna go this way!
- I can't hear you!

36:04.060 --> 36:06.890
- Subway!
- What? What?

36:08.060 --> 36:09.810
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Come on! Come on!

36:09.890 --> 36:12.190
This shit is crazy, dude!

36:21.020 --> 36:22.600
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

36:22.600 --> 36:23.470
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

36:27.270 --> 36:29.470
Hud! Hud!

36:29.560 --> 36:31.510
Are you okay, man? You all right?

36:31.600 --> 36:33.980
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
- Come on.

36:34.060 --> 36:37.560
- Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
- Oh, shit.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.430
What the hell was that?

36:48.060 --> 36:52.140
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Did you see that?

36:52.230 --> 36:54.980
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Did you see that?

37:13.510 --> 37:14.720
Okay.

37:17.510 --> 37:20.720
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

37:20.810 --> 37:22.850
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

37:22.930 --> 37:25.100
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

37:25.190 --> 37:27.190
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

37:27.270 --> 37:29.190
Rob, the air caught on fire!
Okay? There's not gonna be a lull!

37:29.270 --> 37:30.560
But if we wait on the other...

37:30.640 --> 37:33.390
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

37:33.470 --> 37:36.980
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

37:38.310 --> 37:39.980
- We can't...
- Rob, he's right, okay?

37:40.060 --> 37:42.470
We have to wait. We have to wait.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.980
This is insane.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.190
Shit!

38:10.850 --> 38:15.100
- Oh, God.
- What? Rob, what?

38:18.430 --> 38:19.720
Hey, Mom.

38:20.980 --> 38:24.890
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.720
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

38:27.810 --> 38:31.980
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

38:33.390 --> 38:39.020
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

38:39.720 --> 38:42.310
and we were right there when it hit.

38:44.060 --> 38:48.060
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

39:45.230 --> 39:47.560
I don't know what to say to him.

39:49.930 --> 39:51.350
You know?

39:53.810 --> 39:56.430
Like, I feel like I should say something,

39:57.560 --> 39:59.770
but I don't know what to say.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.470
I'm not even supposed to be here.

40:22.470 --> 40:25.680
You didn't have to be. I mean,

40:27.190 --> 40:29.770
you had your chance in the alley.

40:30.350 --> 40:32.140
You could've left us.

40:34.890 --> 40:39.350
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

40:40.680 --> 40:41.810
Yeah.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.100
I'm sorry.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.100
- This isn't a bad idea.
- Just walk.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.470
- Wait, so then...
- What's going on?

40:52.560 --> 40:54.060
I don't know.

41:00.770 --> 41:02.510
...just go across here.
- That's good.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.510
Yeah. This is the six.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.270
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

41:06.350 --> 41:08.430
- No, we can just walk the track, see?
- Yeah.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.020
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.810
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

41:12.890 --> 41:15.890
- Central Park South.
- You want us to walk in the tunnels?

41:15.980 --> 41:18.230
It's either that or stay here.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.190
I'll walk the tunnels.

41:32.350 --> 41:33.510
I can't see.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.930
- It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
- I think there's a light on the camera.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.510
- Let me see.
- There is?

41:38.600 --> 41:41.020
Yeah, right here. See?

41:46.310 --> 41:47.430
Okay.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.100
Ocean is big, dude.

42:02.430 --> 42:04.020
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

42:04.100 --> 42:06.100
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

42:06.190 --> 42:08.190
- had been extinct for centuries.
- So what?

42:08.270 --> 42:10.190
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

42:10.270 --> 42:13.350
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

42:13.430 --> 42:16.890
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

42:16.980 --> 42:20.020
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.680
- Like Superman?
- Yeah, exactly like...

42:22.770 --> 42:24.930
Wait. You know who Superman is?

42:25.020 --> 42:28.680
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

42:28.770 --> 42:31.350
- Okay, I'm not...
- I'm, like, feeling something.

42:31.430 --> 42:33.430
- Are you aware of Garfield?
- A lot of people think

42:33.510 --> 42:35.140
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

42:35.230 --> 42:37.560
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

42:37.640 --> 42:39.770
"Good luck tonight, Travis."

42:41.430 --> 42:43.680
She knows you didn't mean that.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.600
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

42:48.680 --> 42:50.890
- No, that's different.
- Why?

42:52.980 --> 42:54.980
Jason knew you loved him.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.890
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

43:09.980 --> 43:12.100
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.720
- Jesus, Hud.
- What?

43:13.810 --> 43:16.560
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

43:16.640 --> 43:17.850
Right.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.680
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

43:24.770 --> 43:25.980
- came out of the dark right now.
- Hud, seriously.

43:26.060 --> 43:28.190
- Seriously.
- I'm just saying. Sorry.

43:31.980 --> 43:35.190
- What was that?
- Let's just keep moving.

43:36.020 --> 43:39.470
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

43:43.850 --> 43:45.510
This is disgusting.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.430
They're all running
in the same direction.

43:47.510 --> 43:50.390
- Yeah, like they're running away.
- From what?

43:58.140 --> 43:59.980
Hey, how much farther?

44:00.060 --> 44:01.930
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

44:02.020 --> 44:03.390
- Okay?
- Yeah.

44:04.310 --> 44:06.560
Did you guys hear that?

44:07.470 --> 44:09.560
- What is that?
- Just listen.

44:11.390 --> 44:14.310
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

44:17.810 --> 44:20.430
- Oh, man, this is the worst.
- Will you be quiet for five seconds?

44:20.510 --> 44:22.890
- Oh, turn on the night vision.
- What?

44:22.980 --> 44:24.310
- What do you mean?
- It's right here.

44:24.390 --> 44:27.060
I got it. It's right here. There.

44:30.270 --> 44:31.470
Is it on?

44:31.560 --> 44:33.930
- Oh, shit.
- What? What?

44:34.020 --> 44:36.140
- Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
- What?

44:36.230 --> 44:38.810
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

44:38.890 --> 44:43.350
Start running now! Run, run, run!
Run! Just run!

44:43.430 --> 44:45.350
- Lily!
- You guys!

44:48.930 --> 44:50.310
Wait.

44:53.930 --> 44:57.430
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

45:08.890 --> 45:11.600
Marlena! Here!

45:12.850 --> 45:15.600
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

45:19.270 --> 45:20.390
Hud!

45:29.270 --> 45:31.720
...there you go.
- Totally not what I was thinking...

45:46.640 --> 45:48.680
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

45:48.770 --> 45:50.310
You okay?

45:51.930 --> 45:53.350
You tell me.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.850
How does it look?

45:57.850 --> 45:59.640
Looks like it hurts.

46:00.140 --> 46:03.060
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

46:03.140 --> 46:04.140
A little bit.

46:12.390 --> 46:16.140
- Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
- Thanks.

46:16.230 --> 46:19.390
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

46:19.470 --> 46:21.190
No, it didn't get me.

46:22.230 --> 46:23.600
Okay. Okay.

46:27.190 --> 46:29.430
Hey. Hey.

46:30.510 --> 46:32.100
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

46:32.190 --> 46:34.140
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

46:35.930 --> 46:38.640
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.230
What's up with that?

46:42.720 --> 46:45.510
- Maybe it liked you, Hud.
- Yeah.

46:46.060 --> 46:48.810
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

46:52.980 --> 46:58.810
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

47:00.310 --> 47:03.720
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

47:03.810 --> 47:07.390
No. No. I know you aren't.

47:08.560 --> 47:12.680
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.810
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

47:20.770 --> 47:21.930
Right?

47:22.510 --> 47:24.680
It's okay. You just got bit.

47:25.980 --> 47:27.020
Hey.

47:27.430 --> 47:31.470
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

47:31.890 --> 47:33.930
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

47:34.020 --> 47:36.100
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

47:36.190 --> 47:38.100
- Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
- Well.

47:38.190 --> 47:40.930
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

47:41.020 --> 47:44.100
- Maybe find another tunnel.
- No, no more tunnels.

47:44.980 --> 47:48.140
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

47:48.720 --> 47:52.810
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

47:52.890 --> 47:57.470
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

47:57.560 --> 47:59.770
- Yeah, pretty much.
...pretty much the summing up of it?

47:59.850 --> 48:01.310
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

48:01.390 --> 48:05.600
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognize anything.

48:07.350 --> 48:09.100
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

48:09.190 --> 48:10.640
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here, I'll help you.

48:33.510 --> 48:34.680
- We're at 59th.
- We're at 59th.

48:34.770 --> 48:36.510
- Yeah.
- We're at 59th.

48:49.510 --> 48:50.980
That's weird.

48:52.980 --> 48:54.060
What?

48:59.190 --> 49:00.310
Yeah.

49:15.350 --> 49:15.890
Hello!

49:15.890 --> 49:16.600
Hello!

49:33.190 --> 49:34.560
Marlena?

49:34.890 --> 49:37.020
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

49:38.810 --> 49:40.270
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

49:40.350 --> 49:43.100
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

49:46.470 --> 49:48.310
- No, I'm fine.
- She needs a doctor.

49:48.390 --> 49:49.470
- You sure?
- I'm totally fine.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.980
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.060
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

49:52.140 --> 49:54.680
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

49:54.770 --> 49:56.100
- No, just us four.
- It's just us.

49:56.190 --> 49:57.720
We got four civilians here.

49:58.270 --> 50:00.140
-Okay, bring them in.
- Roger.

50:00.230 --> 50:02.470
- Let's go, move. Move it.
- Okay, okay.

50:04.390 --> 50:06.810
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

50:09.470 --> 50:12.600
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.230
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

50:15.310 --> 50:16.850
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.310
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

50:18.390 --> 50:20.850
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

50:20.930 --> 50:24.350
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.270
- What's up?
- We got another bite here.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.140
Don't look at that. Gross.

50:41.230 --> 50:42.890
- Please, we can't stay here. We have...
- Hey, not now.

50:42.980 --> 50:44.430
- Copy that.
- Sir, we have two F-18s

50:44.510 --> 50:46.140
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

50:46.230 --> 50:48.720
- maybe 30 minutes out.
- Roger that.

50:48.810 --> 50:51.770
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

50:51.850 --> 50:54.020
- We're phantoms in 15.
- Sir.

50:54.100 --> 50:56.020
- Where the hell did you find them?
- They were in the tunnels.

50:56.100 --> 50:58.140
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

50:58.230 --> 51:00.600
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.720
- Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
- No, wait. Wait.

51:02.810 --> 51:04.060
- Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
- Move it.

51:04.140 --> 51:05.190
- Move. Move.
- We have to get to her.

51:05.270 --> 51:06.560
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.140
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

51:09.640 --> 51:10.810
Turn that goddamned camera...

51:12.850 --> 51:15.310
- We've been trying to get to her all...
- Make our own way.

51:15.390 --> 51:17.980
- No, do you have a...
- I am not jeopardizing this operation,

51:18.060 --> 51:19.390
- or my men.
- I don't want your help.

51:19.470 --> 51:20.930
You are getting on that chopper now.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.390
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

51:22.470 --> 51:24.600
- You have no idea what's out there.
- I don't care what's out there.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.680
Listen to me. She's dying.

51:25.770 --> 51:26.930
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

51:27.020 --> 51:29.430
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

51:29.510 --> 51:32.230
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

51:32.310 --> 51:34.270
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

51:34.350 --> 51:37.230
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

51:37.310 --> 51:39.680
- then you're gonna have to shoot me.
- Hud.

51:40.470 --> 51:43.310
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, shit.

51:43.390 --> 51:46.350
- Bite! We've got a bite!
- Marlena.

51:46.430 --> 51:47.600
- Hold on a second.
- Get her moving.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.770
Keep moving!

51:48.850 --> 51:50.980
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

51:51.060 --> 51:52.980
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

51:53.060 --> 51:54.810
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

51:54.890 --> 51:56.930
- Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
- Let me go.

51:57.020 --> 51:58.310
- Just wait a second. Please.
- Let me go.

51:58.390 --> 51:59.930
- Wait! Marlena!
- Get out of the way.

52:00.020 --> 52:01.770
Marlena! Hold on a second!

52:01.850 --> 52:04.190
- Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
- No.

52:08.350 --> 52:11.390
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

52:11.470 --> 52:12.720
Wait a second.

52:20.190 --> 52:22.230
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

52:22.310 --> 52:26.470
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

52:27.930 --> 52:30.060
- Rogers, clear out of here.
- You sure?

52:30.140 --> 52:32.190
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

52:32.270 --> 52:34.850
- Let's move out.
- Oh, my God.

52:36.270 --> 52:37.720
What just happened?

52:39.720 --> 52:42.140
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

52:42.230 --> 52:45.310
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

52:45.390 --> 52:47.470
- Let's go. Move.
- Okay, okay.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.980
Let's go, move. Come on.

52:53.230 --> 52:55.060
You gotta listen to me.

52:55.640 --> 52:58.310
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

52:58.390 --> 53:01.230
- Yeah?
- If you wanna go out in this,

53:01.310 --> 53:03.600
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.060
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

53:06.140 --> 53:08.020
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

53:08.100 --> 53:10.720
- You mean Midtown?
- No, I mean Manhattan.

53:10.810 --> 53:13.810
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

53:13.890 --> 53:14.850
- Oh, God.
- If that doesn't work,

53:14.930 --> 53:17.680
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.020
- Your watch is still working?
- Yeah?

53:20.100 --> 53:22.720
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

53:22.810 --> 53:25.510
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

53:25.930 --> 53:28.390
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

53:28.470 --> 53:31.190
- Okay. Okay, thank you.
- 58th Street's right there.

53:31.270 --> 53:33.060
- Now, go. Move, move, move.
- Let's go.

53:33.140 --> 53:34.470
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

53:37.430 --> 53:39.720
- This is like a nightmare, you know.
- It all happened so fast,

53:39.810 --> 53:41.770
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

53:42.350 --> 53:44.810
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

53:44.890 --> 53:47.770
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.190
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

53:53.430 --> 53:54.810
Hud.

53:57.100 --> 54:01.350
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

54:05.140 --> 54:07.890
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

54:07.980 --> 54:11.020
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

54:11.100 --> 54:12.430
All right?

54:13.560 --> 54:17.100
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

54:17.190 --> 54:18.350
Are you sure?

54:18.430 --> 54:21.020
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

54:21.100 --> 54:23.600
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

54:37.350 --> 54:39.430
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

54:39.510 --> 54:41.980
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What?

54:43.020 --> 54:45.810
- Shit.
- That's not Beth's place, is it?

54:45.890 --> 54:47.850
- Oh, my God.
- Is that Beth's apartment?

54:47.930 --> 54:51.350
- Oh, my God.
- Rob. Is that her place?

54:51.930 --> 54:54.680
- Tell me that's not her place.
- That's her place, yeah.

54:56.020 --> 54:59.720
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

54:59.810 --> 55:00.980
No, 39th.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.770
- Oh, great.
- How do we even get up there?

55:02.850 --> 55:06.850
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.770
I don't know if I can do that.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.890
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

55:13.980 --> 55:16.720
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

55:16.810 --> 55:20.020
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.510
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.140
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

55:25.230 --> 55:30.810
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

55:30.890 --> 55:31.890
Great.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.470
Shit. Shit.

55:37.270 --> 55:38.680
Probably not working.

55:38.770 --> 55:40.140
- What's going on?
- Not working.

55:40.230 --> 55:42.560
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

55:44.060 --> 55:45.640
- No? No?
- Shit.

55:45.720 --> 55:48.310
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

55:50.600 --> 55:53.680
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

55:53.770 --> 55:55.930
I mean, they have no idea.

55:57.770 --> 56:01.850
- Unless they're, like, in on it.
- Jesus, Hud.

56:01.930 --> 56:03.310
I don't read the papers.

56:03.390 --> 56:05.060
- Maybe our government made this thing.
- Oh, yeah.

56:05.140 --> 56:06.850
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

56:06.930 --> 56:08.270
- or maybe it was on purpose...
- Sure, maybe they did.

56:08.350 --> 56:10.230
- Does it really matter right now?
- Yeah.

56:11.310 --> 56:14.140
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

56:15.020 --> 56:17.930
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

56:22.770 --> 56:23.770
I'm sorry.

56:26.270 --> 56:29.020
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

56:30.770 --> 56:31.810
- Yes.
- Yeah.

56:31.890 --> 56:34.350
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.770
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

56:37.850 --> 56:38.850
Okay.

56:46.060 --> 56:49.060
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.140
Okay.

56:51.350 --> 56:52.640
Guys, guys, guys.

56:53.390 --> 56:55.850
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

57:11.930 --> 57:12.980
Oh, God.

57:18.930 --> 57:22.510
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.390
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

57:30.230 --> 57:32.850
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

57:33.230 --> 57:34.890
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.470
- I don't know, Rob.
- Look, it's a straight shot.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.890
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.140
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

57:41.230 --> 57:44.350
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

57:44.680 --> 57:46.930
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

57:47.020 --> 57:48.020
- Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
- All right? Okay.

57:48.100 --> 57:52.100
- Okay, I'll document it.
- Be careful, okay?

57:52.680 --> 57:56.270
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

57:59.560 --> 58:03.230
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

58:03.310 --> 58:04.810
Oh, Jesus.

58:04.890 --> 58:07.230
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- I'll go first.

58:07.310 --> 58:11.930
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

58:12.020 --> 58:13.560
- Hud, come on!
- Okay.

58:26.350 --> 58:28.140
Look out! Oh, shit...

58:29.510 --> 58:30.510
Okay.

58:32.980 --> 58:35.230
- Okay. Okay.
- Shit.

58:40.140 --> 58:42.230
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.

58:54.850 --> 58:57.140
- Yes. Okay. You all right?
- Yeah.

58:57.230 --> 58:59.310
We're almost there, come on.

59:01.770 --> 59:03.230
Come on, Hud.

59:07.600 --> 59:08.140
Shit.

59:08.140 --> 59:08.600
Shit.

59:08.680 --> 59:13.310
Beth! Beth! Beth!

59:23.060 --> 59:26.810
- Can you get it?
- Do you need help?

59:27.770 --> 59:29.810
Do you need help? Or...

59:36.430 --> 59:38.100
Beth? Beth?

59:41.640 --> 59:42.680
Beth?

59:45.140 --> 59:48.270
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

59:48.350 --> 59:49.810
- What?
- Shit.

59:50.350 --> 59:54.100
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

59:58.140 --> 59:59.470
- Beth.
- What?

59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.640
Beth!

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.850
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.680
Can you hear me? Beth.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.430
Hey.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.020
- Are you really here?
- Yeah, I'm really here.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:42.890
Rob?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.850
You came back for me.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.020
Of course I came back for you.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:56.100
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
- No, it's okay.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:02.640
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.310
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:07.230
- and help me, okay?
- Okay, okay.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.680
- It'll be okay.
- Okay, here we go.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.140
- If we all just lift at the same time.
- Hold on, okay. We got you.

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.980
- All right? We have to.
- Don't do that, Rob.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.720
- Please don't do that.
- It's gonna be over in a second.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.890
- All right?
- Okay. Ready, guys?

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.190
- No, please. No.
- Slowly. It's okay.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.640
We're gonna do it real slow.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.430
- Easy, easy, just wait.
- No, don't.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.890
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.930
Oh, God.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:35.720
- Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.
- I know. I know. Here.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.770
I know. I know. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.190
- You're gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.770
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.640
What is that?

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:52.720
- God.
- It's a terrible thing.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.600
- Okay. We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Okay. Let's go.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.020
- I got you.
- Oh, God.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.310
- Oh, God.
- All right. All right. Go, go, go.

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.560
- Go.
- Okay. I got you.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.930
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.270
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.060
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.190
- Okay. Hang on to me.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:19.680
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:22.640
Okay.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.430
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:31.230
- Are you okay?
- Just don't look down, okay?

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:33.510
- I can't help it.
- You're all right. You're all right.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.850
Oh, my God.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:39.980
Oh, God!

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.470
- Okay, let's go.
- Keep moving, just go.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.680
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.810
Come on, just keep moving.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.190
Oh, my God.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.770
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.390
- Oh, my God. Did you see that?
- Okay, come on.

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:59.600
- Get inside.
- Okay. Come on, come on.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.680
- Oh, God.
- Go! Go!

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.190
Run! Run! Hurry!

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.390
- Rob, come on!
- Oh, my God.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.310
Oh, my God.

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.310
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.680
Something else also terrible.

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:39.890
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.810
- 0600.
- What time is that?

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:44.510
- 6:00, Hud.
- Yeah, okay. I knew that.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.060
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.930
Wait up!

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.890
- Did we make it?
- We want to get out of here, come on.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:40.470
Let's go! Let's go!

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:43.720
Keep your heads down.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.470
Come on! Come on!

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:49.980
You guys are on the next chopper.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.850
- No!
- Clear this area. Clear this area.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.770
- No, no, wait. Wait.
- Lily!

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.390
We'll be right behind you, okay?

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:02.390
Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.140
We're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna be all right, you hear me?

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.230
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.350
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140
Thank you.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:38.890
- They're starting the bomb run.
- Get them out of here. Get going.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.100
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.140
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.350
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:04.020
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:12.680
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.600
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.230
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.850
- Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
- Oh, he's going down.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.020
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.930
I think they got him.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.430
That's what I'm talking about...
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:40.770
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:43.930
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.640
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.310
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:50.270
Help me, Rob!

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:53.720
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.930
This is Hawkeye 6. Target still active.

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.930
Initiating Hammer Down.
TOT, 15 minutes.

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.230
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.140
lf you can hear those sirens,
you're in the blasting zone.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.470
Come on. Come on. Hud.
Hud, are you okay?

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:41.190
- Yeah, all right. I guess. I think so.
- I can't move my arm.

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.600
-This is Duncan-Charlie, return to base.
- Help me, you got to help me.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.560
-God help us.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.310
Come on, help me.

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.680
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:53.980
Hud, come over to the other side.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.850
You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:57.980
- Okay, okay.
- I don't think I can move.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.560
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.930
Copy your last, we're on the move.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.720
- Here, take his hand. Take his hand.
-Good luck.

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.430
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:11.230
I got his legs, go!

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.560
- My leg!
- I know. I know, I know. I know.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.979
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.510
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.930
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.510
You are going to be able to walk.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.020
Don't do it.

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.640
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.890
Well, which way do we go?

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.100
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:42.060
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- All right? Come on. Let's go.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.600
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.930
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020
- Hud!
- Hud!

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.189
What? Oh! Oh, no!

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.310
- Hud! Hud!
- Hud, what are you doing?

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.680
Hud!

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.979
Hud!

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:30.470
Hud!

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680
Hud!

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.979
Hud! Hud!

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:39.979
Hud! Hud!

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:42.640
Hud! Hud!

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:44.890
Hud!

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:24.890
He's gone.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.140
He's gone.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.390
- They're all gone.
- I know.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.890
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.060
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.390
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:52.560
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.350
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.100
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.310
No, we can't stay.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.720
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:13.020
- I'm so scared.
- I know. I know. I know.

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.930
My name is Robert Hawkins.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.850
It's 6:42 a.m. On Saturday, May 23.

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:52.510
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:54.930
I don't know what it is.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.270
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:01.230
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.100
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.270
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.140
and many, many others.

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.680
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:18.140
The military has begun
bombing the creature

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.310
and we're caught in the middle.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.310
Okay. Ready?

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:29.310
It's okay.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.350
- Beth, look at me.
- I don't know what to say.

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.980
Well, just tell them who you are.

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:44.810
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.510
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:55.980
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.430
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:09.890
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:17.270
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:19.060
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.600
Yeah, we'll see.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.470
Okay, yeah, all right.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.930
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.190
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.430
Last thing to the camera.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.470
I had a good day.
