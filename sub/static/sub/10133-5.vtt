07:54.975 --> 07:56.601
I'm gonna clean the house

07:54.975 --> 07:56.601
this morning

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
and then I'll spend

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
the afternoon

07:58.103 --> 07:59.604
with my granddaughters.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.897
Oh, you are the best, mom.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.190
Oh-ho, thanks, hon.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.443
Oh, mom, uh,

08:02.232 --> 08:04.443
one more thing.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.611
I gotta pick out

08:04.484 --> 08:06.611
a new bed for Michelle.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.946
You got any ideas?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.282
Yes, let me pick it out.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.617
You're the boss.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.621
- You are the best boy.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.621
- You are the best mom.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.332
- No, you are.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.332
- You are.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.125
- No, I love you.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.125
- I love you.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.960
- Not as much as I love you.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.960
- I love you more.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.212
- I bet you don't.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.212
- I do too.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.340
[instrumental music]

08:27.632 --> 08:29.134
We're back from the zoo.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.135
Thanks, Grandma.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.719
I thought I had fun before

08:31.761 --> 08:32.971
but<i> now</i> I know how much

08:33.013 --> 08:34.931
fun-fun it can, really be.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.933
Oh, you silly thing.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.226
My pleasure, honey.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.396
Oh, God.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.981
They delivered the bed.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.358
It looks terrific.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.360
Oh, when it's

08:44.399 --> 08:46.360
a great choice, mom.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.444
Thanks, hon.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.945
No one picks out a pencil bed

08:48.987 --> 08:50.322
quite like you, Claire.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.866
It's got that grandma touch.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.037
Well, let's hope

08:54.951 --> 08:57.037
Michelle likes it.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.289
D.J., bring her in.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.501
My big-girl bed.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.635
You little jumping bean.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.845
Give your grandma

09:12.677 --> 09:13.845
a kiss for buying

09:13.887 --> 09:15.138
you a new trampoline.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.099
Thank you, Granny Tanny.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.686
I am in grandma heaven.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.646
Come on, you guys.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.399
I am gonna cook

09:23.688 --> 09:25.399
you such a dinner

09:25.440 --> 09:27.650
you're gonna think

09:25.440 --> 09:27.650
it is Thanksgiving.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.610
(together)

09:28.402 --> 09:29.610
Oh.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.613
(together)

09:31.071 --> 09:32.613
Oh, oh, oh.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.702
Alright, little munchkin.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.995
You enjoy your new bed

09:39.037 --> 09:40.997
but no more jumping

09:39.037 --> 09:40.997
up and down, okay?

09:41.039 --> 09:43.166
- Okay, Uncle Jesse.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.166
- Alright.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.653
Hello.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.657
Were you jumping up

10:14.822 --> 10:16.657
and down

10:16.699 --> 10:19.077
on the bed, young lady?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.370
Who, me?

10:21.162 --> 10:22.330
The truth.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.707
Or I'm gonna

10:22.372 --> 10:24.707
tickle it out of you.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.667
Come here, you.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.004
Here you go.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.172
Mm, good.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.799
I can't remember

10:31.214 --> 10:32.799
when I had a meal

10:32.840 --> 10:35.385
with so much delicious food.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.097
I can, it was lunch.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.892
Danny, how do you like

10:40.807 --> 10:42.892
your Brussels sprouts?

10:42.934 --> 10:45.895
Oh, mom, steamed to perfection.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.895
As usual.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.066
Here, you eat it, Michelle.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.901
Yuck.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.114
Oh, did you boys write

10:53.278 --> 10:56.114
any commercials today?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.865
- Yes.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.865
- No.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.284
- No.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.284
- Yes.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.953
Uh, well,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.953
the point is, Claire

11:01.995 --> 11:03.538
we couldn't have done

11:01.995 --> 11:03.538
anything without you.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.624
Aw, thanks, honey.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.167
Hey, I'm glad to help out.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.793
In fact, If you want me

11:07.208 --> 11:08.793
to stay a little longer

11:08.835 --> 11:10.003
I'm available.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.421
Hey, that's a great idea,

11:10.044 --> 11:11.421
I mean

11:11.463 --> 11:13.214
...why rush back home?

11:13.256 --> 11:15.425
Yeah, hang. You're making

11:13.256 --> 11:15.425
our life a breeze, Claire.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.843
(together)

11:15.467 --> 11:16.843
Claire.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.471
Guys are right, mom.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.264
I don't know how

11:19.513 --> 11:21.264
we've survived without you.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.557
You really mean it?

11:22.599 --> 11:23.933
(together)

11:22.599 --> 11:23.933
Yeah.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.059
We love having you here.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.102
Well, if you guys

11:26.144 --> 11:27.812
really need me that much.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.440
I guess the only logical thing

11:27.854 --> 11:30.440
would be for me to move in.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.568
Move in?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.777
Here?

11:34.819 --> 11:35.903
Sure.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.114
Honey, that would be..

11:35.945 --> 11:38.114
Listen..

11:38.156 --> 11:39.866
...Joey and Jesse

11:39.907 --> 11:41.951
you guys are young

11:39.907 --> 11:41.951
and you're single

11:41.993 --> 11:43.203
and you've devoted two years

11:43.244 --> 11:46.039
of your lives

11:43.244 --> 11:46.039
raising this family.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.790
Now, here's

11:46.080 --> 11:47.790
your big opportunity.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.418
You can move out and get on

11:47.832 --> 11:50.418
with your own lives.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.505
Because Grandma

11:50.460 --> 11:53.505
is movin' in for good.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.091
[instrumental music]

12:01.720 --> 12:03.473
Grandma, are you really

12:01.720 --> 12:03.473
moving in?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.058
Yes.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.685
Guys, are you really moving out?

12:06.725 --> 12:07.977
(together)

12:06.725 --> 12:07.977
No.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.105
Claire, this is,

12:09.270 --> 12:11.105
this is my family now.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.149
I don't want these girls

12:11.147 --> 12:13.149
growin' up without me.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.651
Or me, I can't leave.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.277
I was just chosen

12:14.693 --> 12:16.277
to be Stephanie's

12:16.319 --> 12:17.945
Honey bee hive mother.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.200
Well, listen,

12:19.322 --> 12:22.200
that's even better.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.951
Oh, Jesse, you know what

12:23.993 --> 12:25.828
you move downstairs with Joey

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
and we'll get you guys

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
bunk beds.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.832
Yes, bunk beds!

12:32.586 --> 12:34.254
What do you think, Danny, huh?

12:34.295 --> 12:36.005
Oh, well, I think

12:36.047 --> 12:38.258
bunk beds make a lot of sense.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.347
Come on, my little angel,

12:40.968 --> 12:44.347
come on.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.849
I gotta get you ready

12:44.389 --> 12:46.849
for your new bed.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.143
My new bed.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.356
(Michelle)

12:51.479 --> 12:53.356
'Come on, Granny Tanny.'

12:53.398 --> 12:55.275
Here I come,

12:53.398 --> 12:55.275
I'm gonna catch you.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.526
Hey, I got dibs

12:55.316 --> 12:56.526
on the top bunk.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.236
We're not getting

12:56.568 --> 12:58.236
any bunk beds.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.698
Danny, what are we

12:59.946 --> 13:01.698
gonna do here?

13:01.740 --> 13:04.576
Hey, nobody panic, it's just

13:01.740 --> 13:04.576
a little misunderstanding.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.744
We may have done too good a job

13:05.784 --> 13:07.537
of making my mom feel needed.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.706
That's what we get

13:07.579 --> 13:09.706
for lying to her.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.458
So I was right.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.334
We were lying.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.920
Shame on us.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.339
No, we're innocent.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.841
It's your father who put

13:18.381 --> 13:20.841
this whole scam together.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.260
Danny, you gotta tell

13:20.883 --> 13:22.260
your mother

13:22.302 --> 13:23.678
that we really

13:22.302 --> 13:23.678
don't need her.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.388
Oh, man.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.056
That would break her heart.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.392
What the matter, are you afraid

13:27.098 --> 13:29.392
to tell your mom the truth?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.936
Hey, don't worry.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.936
I can be honest with my mom.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.025
I was wondering where those

13:35.607 --> 13:38.025
Brussels sprouts went to.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.362
[instrumental music]

13:43.822 --> 13:46.618
Michelle, there we go.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.744
There.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.960
Why don't you just

13:53.249 --> 13:55.960
bubble pack her?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.171
Danny, I'm sorry, but she's

13:56.002 --> 13:58.171
little and she's round.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.756
And she rolls easy.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.717
I say we build kind of

13:59.798 --> 14:02.717
a fence thing around here.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.427
You mean, like a crib?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.554
I know we have one of those

14:04.469 --> 14:06.554
already, didn't we?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.473
Alright, here, we'll put them

14:06.596 --> 14:08.473
on the floor, just in case.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.433
- Jess, You are always thinkin'.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.433
- There we go.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.936
- Goodnight. I love you.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.936
- Goodnight, Michelle.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.772
Alright, Danny.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.772
Go talk to your mother now.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.566
- Okay.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.566
- Alright.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.533
Whoa.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.161
Michelle, did you say something?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.788
I want my crib.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.333
Michelle, cribs are for babies.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
You're a big girl now.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.546
See, the trick to a new bed

14:39.587 --> 14:41.381
is you gotta-you gotta

14:39.587 --> 14:41.381
break it in, you know?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.174
You gotta get

14:41.422 --> 14:43.174
the feel of it.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.635
Alright, first, let's check

14:43.216 --> 14:45.635
the shocks, okay?

14:45.677 --> 14:47.928
Here we go. Ready?

14:47.970 --> 14:51.432
Bada bing, bada bing, bada bing.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.309
Now, that baby's got

14:51.474 --> 14:53.309
a good ride, doesn't it?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.936
Okay, and next,

14:53.351 --> 14:55.936
and most importantly..

14:55.978 --> 14:58.356
...you gotta find

14:55.978 --> 14:58.356
the sweet spot.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.316
Now, the sweet spot is the place

14:58.398 --> 15:00.316
that makes you feel

15:00.358 --> 15:03.862
all nice and cozy and cuddly.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.363
Get out. Let me find it.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.159
Okay, alright, let me see.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.703
Let me see, huh.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.998
That's it, I found it.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.998
Okay, you ready?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.458
Come on, let's see

15:16.040 --> 15:17.458
if you can get it.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.959
Here we go. Ready?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.211
There we go.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.381
There, you're right

15:20.253 --> 15:23.381
in the sweet spot.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.258
Ah, you're gonna sleep

15:23.423 --> 15:25.258
like a baby.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.718
I mean, like a big girl.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.512
Goodnight, little ankle biter.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.308
Uncle Jesse.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.351
Yeah?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.019
Are you leaving me?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.147
Oh, no,

15:50.575 --> 15:51.951
And read it in the dark.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.413
Thank you.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.331

16:36.245 --> 16:39.749
and tell her that I lied to her.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.293
She'd be so disappointed in me.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.128

16:47.548 --> 16:50.551

16:50.593 --> 16:52.219
I could never tell her that.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.555

Yes, mom.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.037

18:37.658 --> 18:39.577
That's crazy.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.829
I don't like

18:39.619 --> 18:41.829
Brussels sprouts either.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.122

18:43.163 --> 18:45.499
you keep telling me

18:43.163 --> 18:45.499

How could anybody

love a vegetable

18:47.460 --> 18:48.878
that smells like feet?

18:50.379 --> 18:53.215
Danny, you didn't come up here

18:50.379 --> 18:53.215
to talk about vegetables.

What's the problem?

This is so hard, um..

Mom, I don't wanna

18:58.471 --> 19:00.222
disappoint you.

Oh, honey, you've never

19:00.264 --> 19:03.183
disappointed me

19:03.225 --> 19:04.936
in your entire life.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.270
Stay tuned.

19:07.063 --> 19:11.191
Uh, when-when I saw

19:11.233 --> 19:14.695
how upset you were

19:11.233 --> 19:14.695
about your retirement

19:14.737 --> 19:16.572
I asked everybody to..

19:17.907 --> 19:19.283
...kind of pretend

19:19.325 --> 19:21.243
that we really needed

19:19.325 --> 19:21.243
you here.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.831
You lied to me?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.834
I'm dirt and I'm scum

19:27.875 --> 19:29.752
and I should be sent

19:27.875 --> 19:29.752
to a reform school.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.132
I feel so stupid.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.592
I thought everybody

19:34.173 --> 19:36.592
really needed me here.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.971
Why did you do that to me?

19:42.348 --> 19:43.891
Because I was trying

19:42.348 --> 19:43.891
to please you.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.604
I spent my whole life

19:45.685 --> 19:48.604
trying to be the perfect son.

19:48.646 --> 19:52.316
Honey, you're not perfect.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.070
But I will always love you

19:52.358 --> 19:56.070
no matter what you do.

19:56.112 --> 20:00.074
And I am very proud of the man

19:56.112 --> 20:00.074
you turned out to be.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.535
Which I can take just

20:00.116 --> 20:02.535
a little bit of credit for.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.787
Thanks, mom.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.123
So you forgive me?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.500
Of course, I forgive you, honey.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.127
I mean, I understand.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.127
It's just that..

20:12.503 --> 20:14.588

20:17.341 --> 20:20.970
Well, not as a live-in maid.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.181

20:21.012 --> 20:23.181

20:29.645 --> 20:31.355

Well, I hope you learned

21:34.168 --> 21:36.254
your lesson.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.547
Oh, I did.

You know, If you ever

21:40.091 --> 21:42.635
and make me feel better,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.805
Okay.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.140
Okay, thanks.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.975
- Goodnight, dad.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.684
Oh, wait, dad, just a minute.

as much as

21:55.898 --> 21:57.775
you think I do.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.194
- Neither do I.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.194
- You don't?

No. Especially scrubbing

22:00.236 --> 22:03.156
the grout in the shower.

It's incredibly,

22:06.993 --> 22:09.662
Well, it is an acquired taste.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.915
And I only asked Santa

22:09.703 --> 22:12.915
for a Dustbuster

22:12.957 --> 22:15.584
because I knew

22:12.957 --> 22:15.584
you'd be proud of me.
