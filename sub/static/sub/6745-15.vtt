00:08.009 --> 00:11.243
That is<i> much</i> better
than yesterday.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.511
Well, it has to be,

00:12.513 --> 00:14.513
otherwise, they'll never
let me go home.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.948
I've told everyone here

00:15.950 --> 00:18.684
that I am bringing you back
to my place.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.285
No, enough is enough.

at your condo.

00:23.958 --> 00:26.425
[ Knock on door ]
Lieutenant, good morning!

00:26.427 --> 00:28.193
You ready for a walk
around the block?

00:29.130 --> 00:33.265
That's it.
You've got it, lieutenant.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.800
[ Sighs ]

00:34.802 --> 00:36.702
You don't have to keep calling
me lieutenant, okay?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.037
Ohh, are you
gonna arrest me

00:38.039 --> 00:39.705
for calling you lieutenant,
lieutenant?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.607
[ Sighs ]
A month ago

00:41.609 --> 00:45.844
I was going to the gym
about four times a week.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.448
Ohh, how are we doing?

00:49.450 --> 00:52.618
Who's this "we"
you're talking about?

00:53.988 --> 00:56.021
[ Gasps ] Okay.
All right.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.956
Andy, if you fall
and break something,

00:57.958 --> 00:59.825
you'll be here
even longer.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.961
Come on.
Okay.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.363
Good point.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.697
I don't want to fall.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.469
Nothing on the fifth level.

for the guy's car.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.211
Huh. Why us
for a suicide?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.480
We're covering for central's
Christmas party.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.148
Ah. 'Tis the season.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.818
All right, how long ago
did the guy jump?

01:25.820 --> 01:27.319
Kendall:
Body's in full rigor,

01:27.321 --> 01:28.587
so I'd say he hit the ground

01:28.589 --> 01:30.155
sometime between 9:00
and midnight.

01:30.157 --> 01:33.725
Driver's license says
he's Kyle gillan.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.727
20 years old.
Address in valencia.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.429
Buzz:
Kind of far from home.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.798
Provenza: Well, I don't suppose
he left a note.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.367
No, but I'm not so sure
the guy jumped, lieutenant.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.969
And why do you say that?

01:43.971 --> 01:46.638
His fingernails are cracked,
and underneath them,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.073
in addition to the dirt,

01:48.075 --> 01:50.542
it looks like a little bird poop
from the railing.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.578
So he was either attacked
by pigeons

01:52.580 --> 01:53.946
or he changed his mind

01:53.948 --> 01:56.148
and tried to grab the railing
on the way down.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.718
And I have a very, very
important dinner this evening.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.487
<i> Very</i> important.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.556
Sanchez: Sykes, we found his car
on the fourth floor.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.593
See? Drove up.
Dropped down.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.496
Wait, hold on.
He's missing a contact.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.464
Oh. Damn it!

02:12.466 --> 02:13.832
[ Stammers ] Don't move.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.934
Sykes, inform the troops,
please.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.771
Hey, guys, you need to look
for a contact lens up there.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.645
I have it.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.113
Sykes: If the contact lens
is here,

02:28.115 --> 02:30.382
it popped out before Kyle
went over the edge.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.618
No cellphone anywhere,
but the kid had a towel,

02:32.620 --> 02:35.454
a yoga mat, and a bottle of
coconut water in his car, so...

02:35.456 --> 02:38.490
Maybe he'd just gone to the gym
for a pre-suicide workout.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.226
Uh, lieutenant.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.361
What is it now, buzz?

02:42.363 --> 02:44.363
I was filming the dirty hood
of the victim's car,

02:44.365 --> 02:48.066
and there are scratch marks
in the dust, right here.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.603
You know what, that looks like
fingers dragging

02:51.605 --> 02:54.072
as the kid's being pulled
to the edge.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.508
That's the dirt
under his nails.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.743
And here's the bird shit.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.178
And here's some blood.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.580
So the murderer was pushing
the victim like this.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.848
Maybe Kyle fought back.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.550
And maybe one of the two
cut themselves.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.051
Okay. Okay!

03:06.053 --> 03:09.021
Let's assume
that it was a murder.

03:09.023 --> 03:09.721
Imagine.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.024
Um, buzz,

03:12.026 --> 03:13.525
see if you can find
the security video.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.662
I want footage of every car
that entered and exited

03:16.664 --> 03:18.730
this parking structure
last night.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.732
Oh, and congratulations,
Sykes.

03:20.734 --> 03:25.103
You've ruined a perfectly
good suicide.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.473
Buzz: Kyle gillan drove into the
parking structure at 10:18 P.M.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.977
And another 23 vehicles
entered half an hour before

03:31.979 --> 03:33.745
and after the approximate
time of death.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.480
Sykes: And the garage
has monthly tenants,

03:35.482 --> 03:38.684
but there's also a dance club
across the street called twist.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.118
Saturday is
their busiest night.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.020
Have we identified
any of the drivers yet?

03:42.022 --> 03:44.089
All but someone in a Porsche
with no plates.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.325
There's lettering
on the empty license frame,

03:46.327 --> 03:47.392
but it's pretty blurry.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.262
The car enters at 10:28 P.M.

03:50.264 --> 03:54.600
And then at 10:41 P.M.,
the Porsche exits.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.134
Sykes: 13 minutes.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.769
Not enough time for
a quick drink at twist.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.371
Dr. morales:
There's no mystery here.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.940
He died of massive blunt force
trauma caused by the fall.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.775
He's so young.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.143
Mm.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.046
How is it that his head and face
are still intact?

04:08.048 --> 04:10.983
Because he landed
feet-first.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.317
The force of the impact

04:12.319 --> 04:14.519
transmitted from
his crushed heels,

04:14.521 --> 04:17.322
through his legs,
shattering his pelvic ring.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.925
These bones, then, were driven
into his abdomen,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.261
where they punctured a lot
of important stuff.

04:22.263 --> 04:27.532
And I removed
the victim's fingernails

04:27.534 --> 04:31.737
because they normally
just don't crack this way.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.439
Unless you're fighting
for your life.
Agreed.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.075
What about the blood we found
on the parking sign?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.244
Was it Kyle's?
Mm. Nope.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.213
It's type "o,"
and Kyle's type "b."

04:41.215 --> 04:44.016
Your victim wasn't bleeding
before he hit the ground.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.418
If we find the killer,
at least we'll have DNA.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.588
What else do we know
about Kyle gillan?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.889
No criminal record.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.191
The only address we have
is from the dmv --

in valencia.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.895
No cellphone,
no credit cards.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.230
He never filed taxes,

04:58.232 --> 05:00.198
but then he was only 20
and living at home.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.001
Well, maybe his parents
can tell us

05:03.003 --> 05:06.104

last night.

from our son in over a year.

to Kyle, either.

is there any particular reason

05:18.819 --> 05:21.386
why you've lost touch
with your son?

05:21.388 --> 05:22.621
Yeah, because he stole
from me.

Carrie, do you expect me
to pretend

05:25.526 --> 05:27.726
that Kyle's not a delinquent
to the police?

05:27.728 --> 05:30.329
Kyle only wants
his independence.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.963
No, what Kyle wants
is to smoke pot

05:31.965 --> 05:33.598
with his burnout friends
and never grow up.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.734
Last year, I get a charge
on my credit card

05:35.736 --> 05:38.337
I don't recognize, and it's
for a $3,000 television.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.472
When I confronted him,
Kyle screams at me,

05:40.474 --> 05:41.907
saying I never loved him,

05:41.909 --> 05:43.442
all kinds of
ridiculous bullshit --

manage him anymore.

Never filed taxes.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.268
Southland classics also own
the garage from which he fell,

down the street.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.665
This building's old, so it

19:05.845 --> 19:07.745
Yo, nice to meet y'all.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.681
Always glad to be running
into police officers

19:10.683 --> 19:12.884
on their own turf,
especially you.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.886
Wish I could hang
for a bit,

19:14.888 --> 19:17.688
but I have work to finish
this afternoon,

19:17.690 --> 19:19.357
and the studio's
already paid for.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.391
So, how can we help you?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.959
Oh, well, we were hoping

19:21.961 --> 19:23.995
to speak with your client alone
for a moment.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.330
You, the media,
and every woman under 40.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.233
Where he goes, I go.
Now, what is this about?

19:29.235 --> 19:32.537
It's about a young man
named Kyle gillan.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.504
Sound familiar?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.039
What?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.607
Yo, this won't take long.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.209
Go grab lunch,
or whatever.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.378
As your lawyer,
I need to tell you

19:40.380 --> 19:43.114
that leaving you here
on your own --
hey! I said
this won't take long.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.316
I pay you, okay?
Not the other way around.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.617
Get out.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.488
Leave, please.
All y'all.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.490
[ Clears throat ]
Get out.

19:53.393 --> 19:57.028
Thank you.
Okay, where do you want me?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.696
Um, right -- right through here.
After you.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.033
Oh, peaches,
don't go too far.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.110
According to this website,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.746
some of my symptoms are what
happens before a stroke.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.782
[ Sighs ]
Andy, your dizziness

20:17.784 --> 20:19.951
is probably
positional vertigo,

20:19.953 --> 20:22.420
caused by the way you've been
sleeping on these flat pillows.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.556
But --
and you need to stop
diagnosing yourself online.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.925
[ Sighs ] Here.
Drink this.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.961
Oh, uh, what's in it?

20:29.963 --> 20:32.163
It's some stuff to help
your soft tissue.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.398
There's no pain killers,
no opiates.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.833
Here, it's citrus-y.

20:35.835 --> 20:36.968
Oh, okay.

20:36.970 --> 20:41.072
I'm gonna look
at your chart.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.807
Mmm.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.810
Ah, well, your clot
is completely gone.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.878
And, wait a minute --

20:47.880 --> 20:50.081
who filled out these
dnr forms for you?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.382
Is somebody
trying to kill you?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.784
Yeah, your boyfriend.
[ Chuckles ] Louie.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.520
Yeah, not the professional
caregiver.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.922
How do you put up with him?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.724
Well, he makes me laugh.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.093
And, well, you know,
my late husband --

21:02.095 --> 21:03.794
he was a homicide cop, too.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.763
So, better at looking
after strangers

21:05.765 --> 21:07.898
than those people
closest to him.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.534
But I have to admit,
Louie is improving.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.670
And so are you,
my friend.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.405
65. Not bad.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.607
I have a feeling you're gonna be
able to go home tomorrow.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.144
Oh, you know, I don't know
if I'm ready to be on my own.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.546
But you're not gonna be
on your own.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.948
There's Sharon and rusty.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.683
I-I-I can't keep staying
at Sharon's.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.953
I -- see, I don't want her to
look at me like an invalid or --

21:28.955 --> 21:31.522
or think of me as someone
she has to take care of.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.026
Well, Andy, the hospital isn't
gonna release you on your own.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.327
What?
[ Chuckles ]

21:36.329 --> 21:39.030
No, they will send you
to a convalescent center

21:39.032 --> 21:40.765
for at least
another week.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.999
A convalescent center?

21:42.001 --> 21:44.402
I never thought
about that.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.203
Boy, patrice,
you really know how

21:46.205 --> 21:47.972
to lay it out there
for someone.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.474
No wonder provenza
wants to marry you.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.978
What?

21:53.980 --> 21:56.914
Wait, is that what this big
special dinner

21:56.916 --> 21:58.115
tonight is all about?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.351
You know,
I-I have no idea.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.753
I mean, he's never talked
to me about marriage.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.055
I've just inferred.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.423
Hey, what's in this drink,
by the way?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.391
I mean, it really
tastes terrific.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.794
Is it the citrus?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.062
Provenza:
Why did you say that?!

22:11.064 --> 22:13.931
Well, of course I'm mad!

22:13.933 --> 22:16.067
Because, Flynn, when I decide

22:16.069 --> 22:19.070
that I want to get engaged
to someone,

22:19.072 --> 22:21.872
normally I propose
to them myself.

[ Cellphone beeps ]

All right,
I need this guy to confess

22:26.546 --> 22:29.046
'cause I have got
to get out of here.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.549
Uh, has anyone
called hobbs?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.818
Huh? I mean, we know
it's always the rapper.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.887
It's always the rapper.
Sir, it's -- it's --
it's not rap.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.155
It's hip-hop.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.990
No, he sings.
There's a difference.

Kyle at his apartment.

But he never showed.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.977
Is that why you read me
my rights?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.579
How did you
first meet Kyle?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.214
Through a mutual friend.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.750
Mutual friend
called the Internet?

23:05.752 --> 23:07.385
Fine.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.720
We met on a webcam site
four months ago,

23:09.722 --> 23:10.921
but that's not illegal.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.456
I never gave him a cent.

talking online.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.856
grasping at anything
he could get ahold of

37:06.858 --> 37:09.392
before you threw him
off the garage.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.762
If the young leland branch
is alive and unhurt,

37:12.764 --> 37:14.831
I'll call you a lawyer myself.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.867
Leland? He's fine.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.538
I just moved him to a building
in San clemente.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.640
That's all.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.609
Please.
I've heard enough.

37:25.611 --> 37:29.012
Mr. meyer, you're either under
arrest for second-degree murder,

37:29.014 --> 37:31.414
or we will attach
sexual assault,

37:31.416 --> 37:34.985
and you will disappear
for the rest of your life.

37:34.987 --> 37:36.453
What's it gonna be?

37:38.257 --> 37:39.823
[ Grunts ]

37:50.569 --> 37:52.669
So the guy wound up having
a wife and a kid in San Diego

37:52.671 --> 37:54.304
and a boyfriend
in L.A.?

37:54.306 --> 37:57.674
Whom he kept in an apartment
under a watchful eye.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.908
So he's a little like you.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.544
Well, I am pushing

38:01.546 --> 38:02.912
for you to come back
to my place,

38:02.914 --> 38:04.414
and I'm promising
to take care of you.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.417
Although only until you can
manage on your own.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.552
Which is not
the tit-for-tat arrangement

38:09.554 --> 38:12.489
wildkyle95 had with his killer,
that's for sure.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.260
What's wrong?

38:17.262 --> 38:21.998
I am so bothered that we are not
prosecuting Eric meyer

38:22.000 --> 38:23.767
for samir's rape, too.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.335
Yeah, I know.

38:25.337 --> 38:28.972
Unfortunately, it sounds like
a he-said-he-said kind of thing,

38:28.974 --> 38:31.708
which is hard to win without
more physical evidence.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.576
But the good news is
the state

38:33.578 --> 38:36.780
is entering into a relationship
with Mr. meyer,

38:36.782 --> 38:39.316
much like the one he had
with his victim.

38:39.318 --> 38:42.952
Oh, California will be keeping
him in a building

38:42.954 --> 38:44.988
they own
for a very long time.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.123
Till death do them part.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.366
Oh.
[ Clears throat ]

39:06.345 --> 39:10.380
Unless you have a compelling
reason to do otherwise,

39:10.382 --> 39:13.683
I re-made our dinner
reservations for tonight.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.552
And I thought
it would be easier

39:15.554 --> 39:18.822
for us to get to the restaurant
if I just showed up.

39:18.824 --> 39:22.492
Well, I-I have a lot
of work yet to do.

39:22.494 --> 39:27.097
And I-I-I wanted
to talk to you about...

39:27.099 --> 39:28.998
Did Andy tell you
what he said?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.034
[ Sighs ]

39:31.036 --> 39:32.769
Louie, is that why you didn't
come home last night?

39:32.771 --> 39:36.906
And every phone call since,
been reduced to, "talk later"?

39:36.908 --> 39:40.143
Well, we did have
a murder to solve.

39:40.145 --> 39:43.713
A-and I have not
reduced every...

39:43.715 --> 39:46.816
Look, Flynn blurted out

39:46.818 --> 39:48.151
something
that he shouldn't have.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.521
And when you never
mentioned it, I...

39:51.523 --> 39:53.223
Well...

39:53.225 --> 39:54.257
Oh...

39:54.259 --> 39:58.461
Look, honey, I don't know him
like you do.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.296
And for the record,

40:00.298 --> 40:03.566
I do not get my news
about the world from Andy Flynn.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.834
[ Chuckles ]

40:04.836 --> 40:09.038
Look, I...Brought
your meds with me...

40:09.040 --> 40:10.073
[ Pills rattle ]

40:10.075 --> 40:11.908
...and that little light

40:11.910 --> 40:13.943
that you like to use
on menus.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.545
All right?

40:15.547 --> 40:17.213
And, Louie, I am very much

40:17.215 --> 40:20.116
looking forward
to last night's dinner.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.720
Oh, and, just for fun,

40:23.722 --> 40:28.391
I made sure that we will have
a table outside

40:28.393 --> 40:32.028
on the terrace
with a view of the city,

40:32.030 --> 40:35.031
you know, just in case our meal
turns out to be,

40:35.033 --> 40:37.834
um, memorable...

40:37.836 --> 40:40.303
In some way.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.108
Patrice...

40:45.110 --> 40:48.678
You think you're ready
for this...

Dinner?

40:50.449 --> 40:52.582
[ Sighs ]

40:52.584 --> 40:54.350
I definitely am.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.688
I-if<i> you</i> still
want to go.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.024
So...

41:01.026 --> 41:03.793
What do you say,
Louie?

41:07.032 --> 41:08.765
I say...

41:08.767 --> 41:11.601
I do.

41:19.411 --> 41:21.878
I...

41:21.880 --> 41:23.613
Do.

41:27.319 --> 41:29.385
Ohh.
