00:12.012 --> 00:15.614
¶ Earth stood hard as iron

00:15.616 --> 00:19.952
¶ Water like a stone ¶

00:24.124 --> 00:25.290
- [Girl] There.

00:26.726 --> 00:27.960
I don't know.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.963
- Let me see it darling.

00:30.965 --> 00:34.900
¶ Snow on snow ¶

00:37.737 --> 00:38.404
- [Girl] Do you like it?

00:38.406 --> 00:39.605
- I love it.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.673
What am I looking at here?

00:42.208 --> 00:44.576
- [Girl] That's
Mommy, that's Daddy,

00:44.578 --> 00:45.978
that's me, and that's--

00:45.980 --> 00:48.747
- Santa Claus, I know
him when I see him.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.649
But where's your sister?

00:52.318 --> 00:54.053
Are you angry with her?

00:55.488 --> 00:56.755
Sweetheart?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.924
- [Girl] There was no
more room on the paper.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.831
- Angel, tell Grandma the truth.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.600
- [Girl] She makes Daddy angry,

01:09.369 --> 01:11.270
she makes Mommy sad.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.239
So sad that she cries.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.675
- And you, does
she make you sad?

01:17.243 --> 01:18.677
- [Girl] Sometimes.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.450
What are you reading?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.819
- Oh this is an old story.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.153
- [Girl] Older than you?

01:28.155 --> 01:30.055
- Yes, even older than me.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.560
- [Girl] What kind
of story is it?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.261
- It's a Christmas story.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.431
- [Girl] Can you read it to me?

01:40.467 --> 01:42.401
- [Grandmother] Oh I
don't know, it's late.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.803
And this one used to
give me nightmares.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.706
- [Girl] That looks like Santa.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.477
- It is, or Saint Nicholas
as he used to be called.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.947
- [Girl] So how's
this a scary story?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.256
Who's that?

02:04.258 --> 02:05.624
- Who's that?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.226
That's Krampus.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.394
You've never heard of Krampus?

02:10.562 --> 02:13.065
Well Krampus is old, very old.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.367
Old as time itself.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.939
And just as Santa rewards
good little girls and boys,

02:20.941 --> 02:23.342
Krampus punishes the bad ones.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.078
- [Girl] That's
not a true story.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.846
- Don't be so sure child.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.382
As with many ancient stories,

02:30.384 --> 02:33.485
the Krampus has passed from
legend into superstition.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.688
But old and forgotten
things have a way of

02:36.690 --> 02:40.425
ever so slowly creeping
back into our world.

Zoe's it, I got her!

03:47.060 --> 03:48.694
Gross!

03:49.295 --> 03:50.629
Don't touch it!

03:50.631 --> 03:51.930
- Why?

03:53.499 --> 03:56.468
- You're weird, stay
away from me, Zoe.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.138
It was me all along.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.741
Strong for you,
my one true love.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.809
- Remember, with Christmas
around the corner.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.911
- It's extra important to
listen to your parents.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.014
- [Middle girl] So you don't
end up on the naughty list.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.116
- Hey!

04:44.118 --> 04:45.117
Turn it back!

04:50.690 --> 04:53.458
What, you didn't hear me?

04:54.594 --> 04:56.728
- My love for you is
strong like a tiger.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.364
- [Tristan] Then
kiss me, Tigress.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.101
My love for you
flows like a river.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.005

06:09.702 --> 06:10.802
Wow, what are you doing?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.070
- I'm gonna have
my way with you.

06:12.072 --> 06:12.971
- That's rather fast.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.905
- [Man] Right.

06:13.907 --> 06:18.143
(swanky music)

06:27.353 --> 06:28.754
- What the hell?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.089
Bed, now.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.027
- Ow, you're hurting me.

Who's there?

have multiple DBs,

requesting back-up,
detectives and crime scene.

10:12.078 --> 10:16.948

10:56.622 --> 10:58.089

10:58.724 --> 11:00.258
- [Male officer] Fremont,
we got a locked door.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.179
- Here you go, sweetheart.

11:21.181 --> 11:25.583
(calming music)

11:32.992 --> 11:37.662
(moves into foreboding music)

11:46.872 --> 11:48.440
- [Voiceover] We've
got a foster child,

11:48.442 --> 11:50.909
I'm not sure if she saw
or heard anything, though.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.912
So far she's not talking.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.114
Let a couple of
unis take her over

11:56.116 --> 11:57.248
to the children's warden.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.983
Mercy Immanuel Hospital.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.020
Stewart's on her way there now.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.056
Hope she can get
something out of her.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.226
- Okay.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.261
And...

12:12.465 --> 12:14.332
I need to call you back, bye.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.034
How can I help you?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.103
- Dr. Rachel Stewart,
I called from the road,

12:18.105 --> 12:20.138
I'm here for the Zoe
Weaver interview.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.874
- Right...

12:23.609 --> 12:24.676
Sign here.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.420
- Dr. Stewart.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.688
- [Rachel] Hey Miles.

12:36.690 --> 12:37.889
- James, this is Dr. Stewart.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.190
She helps us out,
from time to time.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.492
- I try to anyway.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.093
- My partner Detective Cegan.

12:42.095 --> 12:42.994
- Doctor.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.028
- [Rachel] Call me Rachel.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.331
- Dr. Stewart, Det. O'Connor?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.499
- [Miles] Yes, that's us.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.167
- Tom Jennings,
Head of Pediatrics.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.202
If you'd like to
follow me, please.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.276
- [Miles] So is she talking yet?

12:58.811 --> 13:00.145
- It took us the
better part of an hour

13:00.147 --> 13:02.180
to get her to tell us her name.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.715
- Shock?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.850
- Responsive, just

13:06.485 --> 13:07.919
disinterested.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.699
That's her.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.768
Sitting by herself over there.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.238
- [James] Let's go say hello.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.575
- It's your case detective, but,

13:31.510 --> 13:32.977
I think we might have more luck

13:32.979 --> 13:35.413
if I go talk to her
by myself first.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.752
- Go ahead, it's your show, doc.

13:44.456 --> 13:47.158
- Zoe, this is Dr. Stewart.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.626
- Rachel.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.696
- Dr. Stewart would like
to ask you a few questions.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.964
Okay?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.138
- What kind of doctor are you?

14:00.840 --> 14:03.007
- I'm a child psychologist, so,

14:03.009 --> 14:04.943
I'm the kind of doctor
that helps kids out

14:04.945 --> 14:07.312
when they've been
through some scary stuff.

14:09.582 --> 14:10.481
- What's that?

14:10.483 --> 14:11.683
- [Rachel] What?

14:12.051 --> 14:13.318
- [Zoe] That.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.422
- Oh, I've had that
for a really long time.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.724
Since I was probably
about your age.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.494
So is it all right if I
ask you a few questions?

14:23.496 --> 14:25.563
- You want to know
about Katie and Teddy.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.999
- Yes.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.701
I'd like to know what
happened to them.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.402
- Why?

14:31.404 --> 14:33.238
They were bad, and
now they're gone.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.973
- How are they gone, Zoe?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.774
- He took them.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.910
He took them because
they were bad.

14:39.778 --> 14:42.247
He always comes
for the bad ones.

14:42.748 --> 14:43.982
- Who's he?

14:45.918 --> 14:48.219
Zoe, who hurt your
foster parents?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.188
- I don't wanna talk anymore.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.190
- Now Zoe, you need
to answer the doctor.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.791
- No, it's okay.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.294
It's okay we can
talk more later.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.464
Do you need anything?

14:59.466 --> 15:00.798
- What?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.902
- Anything I can get you, uhm,

15:04.503 --> 15:06.437
I don't know, toys or a book?

15:06.439 --> 15:08.106
- My dolls and my sewing kit.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.507
I asked if I could bring them.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.942
But they said no.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.809
- Sure.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.077
Are they at the house?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.213
- In my room, under the bed.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.482
- I'll find them for you.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.817
It was so nice meeting you, Zoe.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.120
I'll see you later.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.428
- Well that was a
short interview.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.666
You sure you don't wanna
push a little harder?

15:34.668 --> 15:35.934
- Not yet.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.370
Whatever she saw, she's
clearly traumatized.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.806
We'll take it slow.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.042
She'll open up when she's ready.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.244
- Let's hope so.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.546
- I'm going to need
access to the scene.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.748
- Why?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.017
- Zoe asked me to
pick up a few things.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.121
- You wanna take evidence
from my crime scene?

15:57.556 --> 15:59.223
- A little girl's
dolls are probably not

15:59.225 --> 16:00.858
the smoking gun
you're looking for.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.161
- Ah, yeah.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.079
- Cozy I guess.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.515
- Well we found narcotics
in the master bedroom.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.517
- You think this
could be drug related?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.754
- I don't know.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.823
At this point anything and
everything is possible.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.459
First responders found the
girl in a room down the hall.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.763
(foreboding music)

16:46.705 --> 16:48.673
- Well it's cheerful enough.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.010
- Yeah, seems to all be
window dressing though.

16:52.411 --> 16:55.413
Turns out the Holezers were
always taking in (mumbling).

16:55.914 --> 16:57.281
One after the other.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.818
Neighbors said the kids
always looked shabby.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.554
Dressed in Goodwill clothes.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.357
Always two sizes too
big or too small.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.291
Miss Holezer though.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.661
She always dressed to
the nines with a new car

17:10.663 --> 17:12.030
in the driveway.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.830
- Could be a murder.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.701
- Yeah, could be.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.439
Anyhow, angry broke parent
or juvenile delinquent,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.473
giving the revolving
door situation,

17:23.476 --> 17:25.042
I'm sure we're not
gonna have a short list

17:25.045 --> 17:26.944
of suspects to sift through.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.182
(growling)

17:31.184 --> 17:32.683
Did you find what
you're looking for?

17:32.685 --> 17:34.218
- What is this?

17:34.520 --> 17:35.887
- [Miles] Yeah that's ugly.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.221
- It's scary.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.891
- Yeah, scary as well.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.727
All right uhm,

17:43.629 --> 17:44.962
ready to go?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.065
- Impatient detective?

17:47.633 --> 17:49.600
- Actually, bored stiff, doctor.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.868
- All right.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.676
- And that is why Santa
has nine reindeer.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.478
- Do you think
Santa will remember

18:00.480 --> 18:01.946
to come here for us?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.715
- How can he, there's no
chimney in the hospital.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.983
- Oh that's just not true.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.518
- What?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.587
- Remember yesterday when
I took you out for a walk?

18:10.856 --> 18:13.658
Remember that huge smokestack
by the tall building

18:13.660 --> 18:14.859
behind the garden?

18:14.861 --> 18:15.827
- [Kid in wheelchair] Yeah.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.129
- Well, that's our chimney.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.231
And that is how
Santa is gonna come,

18:20.233 --> 18:21.732
and bring you all
a bunch of presents

18:21.734 --> 18:23.101
on Christmas Eve.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.569
- That's not true.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.509
- Zoe.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.486
What do you mean, Zoe?

18:41.887 --> 18:43.321
- That's not a chimney.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.423
It's a smokestack.

18:45.924 --> 18:46.858
The smoke that comes out

18:46.860 --> 18:48.092
is from the bodies of the people

18:48.094 --> 18:50.261
that they burn
after they die here.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.767
- Zoe uh...

19:02.674 --> 19:04.075
You're a smart kid.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.444
I can tell.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.213
And I know you've
been through a lot.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.050
But they've been
through a lot too.

19:14.219 --> 19:16.787
You know, and they (mumbling).

19:17.789 --> 19:19.790
You don't wanna scare 'em

19:19.792 --> 19:21.626
or give 'em nightmares, do you?

19:27.799 --> 19:32.637
(foreboding music)

19:39.678 --> 19:44.749
(eerie music)

19:56.461 --> 19:57.528
- Zoe?

19:58.163 --> 19:59.397
Are you okay?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.606
Why are you staring
at that nice man?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.107
- You brought my things?

20:10.109 --> 20:11.442
- I did.

20:15.247 --> 20:20.017
(foreboding music)
(growling)

20:22.154 --> 20:23.754
Tell me about this little guy.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.357
- He's the Krampus.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.392
- That's his name, Krampus?

20:29.194 --> 20:31.229
He's kinda scary looking.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.169
Zoe are you ready to
talk about what happened?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.504
- What happened?

20:40.506 --> 20:41.772
- When your parents d--

20:41.774 --> 20:43.541
- They weren't my parents.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.209
They were bad.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.844
- How were they bad?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.848
Zoe is there anything
else you can tell me?

20:50.850 --> 20:53.618
Anything that you
might've seen or heard?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.519
- Tell me more about your scar.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.059
You don't like to
talk about it, why?

21:02.061 --> 21:03.561
- We're not here
to talk about me.

21:03.563 --> 21:07.932
(phone vibrating)

21:08.500 --> 21:09.734
Hey sweetie.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.602
Yeah I'm almost done,

21:11.604 --> 21:13.604
I, yes I'll be home soon.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.806
I can totally pick up a pizza.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.209
I know, no mushrooms.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.343
Okay.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.878
Love you too, bye.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.380
- Who was that?

21:22.848 --> 21:24.315
- That was my son.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.250
- Your son?

21:26.252 --> 21:27.818
- His name is Lamar.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.087
- Does his daddy live with you?

21:30.089 --> 21:33.624
- His daddy actually
passed away.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.326
His mommy did too, I'm his--

21:35.328 --> 21:36.994
- You're his foster mother?

21:37.362 --> 21:39.230
Foster mothers are mean!

21:39.731 --> 21:41.565
- Are you talking
about Ms. Holezer?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.368
Were she and Mr.
Holezer mean to you?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.537
- And selfish.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.507
So Krampus said they
needed to be punished.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.009
- Krampus talks to you?

21:52.878 --> 21:54.145
- Sometimes.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.546
- What does he say?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.182
- He knows who's been bad.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.751
- And?

22:01.286 --> 22:02.687
- He punishes them.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.622
- How does he do that?

22:04.624 --> 22:05.923
- He burns them.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.059
- Burns them?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.128
Like Mr. and Ms.
Holezer were burned?

22:11.797 --> 22:12.997
- I'm tired.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.699
- Zoe, it's really
important that we--

22:14.701 --> 22:15.599
- [Zoe] No!

22:15.601 --> 22:16.367
- [Rachel] Zoe, I really--

22:16.369 --> 22:18.135
- I said, no more.

22:20.405 --> 22:21.605
- Okay.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.808
Okay you get some rest.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.010
I'll be back tomorrow.

22:30.615 --> 22:35.319
(foreboding music)

22:42.494 --> 22:44.328
Lamar, dinner's here.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.264
Sweetheart?

22:48.600 --> 22:53.471
(foreboding music)

23:00.412 --> 23:01.345
- Hey!

23:01.347 --> 23:02.713
- (gasps) Christ you scared me!

23:02.715 --> 23:05.182
(alarm beeping)
Oh God, I'll get the alarm.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.355
What happened in here?

23:11.357 --> 23:13.958
- I got hungry so I tried
to cook something up.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.893
- And burn the house
down in the process?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.495
- Sorry.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.930
- Sweetheart I told you I
was bringing pizza home.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.532
Look at this.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.467
It's a disaster.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.903
- I guess we'll have to eat
our pizza with the fork.

23:26.805 --> 23:27.972
- I guess so.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.507
(phone vibrating)
Can you go open a window

23:29.509 --> 23:31.308
and grab us some plates?

23:31.877 --> 23:33.010
Hey Miles.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.513
- Hey we got a positive
ID on the vics.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.747
No surprise.

23:37.282 --> 23:39.450
Holezers are our BBRs.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.185
- That was fast.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.955
- Yeah, well, local media
caught wind of this, so.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.290
I just wanted to make
sure you had answers

23:46.292 --> 23:47.858
for the cameras in the morning.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.226
- And?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.628
- [Miles] Did you get
anything from the girl yet?

23:51.229 --> 23:53.431
- You want me earning
my paycheck (mumbling)?

23:54.199 --> 23:55.466
- That bad?

23:55.468 --> 23:57.668
- Yeah, even for a kid
who's been through a lot

23:57.670 --> 24:00.070
there's something
really weird about her.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.575
- Is that your professional
opinion Dr. Stewart?

24:04.577 --> 24:05.976
- Ha-ha.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.179
- Ah, she freaks you out, so,

24:08.181 --> 24:10.381
maybe we (mumbling).

24:10.982 --> 24:12.616
Maybe I should slap
the cuffs on her.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.052
See, (mumbling)
press conference.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.387
- Funny.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.823
- Are you gonna stop by
McCaffrey's for a pint?

24:18.825 --> 24:19.790
- A pint?

24:19.792 --> 24:20.958
As in singular?

24:21.860 --> 24:24.328
- Yeah, and a shot.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.797
Maybe two.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.799
Any chance you'd join me?

24:29.935 --> 24:31.869
- Go home to your wife, Miles.

24:32.704 --> 24:33.971
- There's a thought.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.972
- I gotta go.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.475
- [Miles] Hey, (mumbling).

24:37.477 --> 24:39.443
- Well I'll be sure
to stop by the church

24:39.445 --> 24:40.911
in the morning and (mumbling).

24:40.913 --> 24:44.648
- Ha, all right,
good night Rachel.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.783
- Bye.

24:47.519 --> 24:51.889
(calming music)

25:41.439 --> 25:43.007
(door knocking)

25:44.242 --> 25:48.646
(ominous music)

26:06.364 --> 26:07.331
- [Man] Can I help you?

26:07.333 --> 26:08.832
- Hi I'm Tammy Miller from 308

26:08.834 --> 26:10.601
and this is Jenny from 424.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.036
- Hi.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.237
- We're just letting folks
know we're putting together

26:13.239 --> 26:14.138
a canned food drive this
year to help some of

26:14.140 --> 26:15.039
the lower income families.

26:15.041 --> 26:15.940
- Sorry, I can't help you.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.008
- [Tammy] What if you just--
- Fuck off!

26:37.963 --> 26:42.700
(foreboding music)

26:45.904 --> 26:47.838
- [Voiceover] And that is
how Santa is gonna come

26:47.840 --> 26:50.608
and bring you all a bunch of
presents for Christmas Eve.

26:57.382 --> 27:01.151
(growling)

27:13.798 --> 27:15.733
- Birth name Zoe Weaver.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.272
Picture's over two years old

27:22.274 --> 27:24.341
and she hasn't aged a day.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.945
(foreboding music)

27:27.947 --> 27:29.947
Krampus.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.121
Krampus, the Christmas devil.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.323
Originally found
in Alpine folklore

27:39.325 --> 27:41.425
he's a horned
anthropomorphic figure

27:41.427 --> 27:44.795
who punishes wicked children
during the holiday season.

27:46.064 --> 27:49.033
Contrary to the different
variations of Saint Nicholas,

27:49.035 --> 27:52.670
or Santa Claus who is said
to reward good children,

27:53.505 --> 27:57.941
Krampus is sent to
punish the evil ones.

27:57.943 --> 28:02.813
(ominous music)

28:20.732 --> 28:22.533
- What the fuck?

28:23.368 --> 28:27.538
(coughing)

28:32.343 --> 28:34.111
Ah, fuck!

28:34.446 --> 28:38.482
(screaming)

28:38.484 --> 28:43.187
(growling)

28:45.290 --> 28:46.557
(sceaming)

28:46.559 --> 28:51.628
(anticipating music)

29:03.908 --> 29:05.008
(door knocking)

29:05.010 --> 29:06.076
- [Lamar] Mom!

29:06.078 --> 29:07.711
- What sweetheart?

29:08.113 --> 29:10.080
- [Lamar] There's a
drunk cop at the door.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.720
- What?

29:18.823 --> 29:19.957
Really?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.026
- What?

29:23.461 --> 29:24.995
- What are you doing here?

29:26.431 --> 29:29.466
- I was just, I was in the
neighborhood and then I...

29:30.535 --> 29:32.369
I thought I'd stop by
and see what my favorite

29:32.371 --> 29:34.204
psychiatrist was up to.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.707
- Sleeping, at least I was.

29:36.709 --> 29:39.176
- (laughs) What are
you talking about?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.511
It's like 10...

29:41.012 --> 29:43.580
Oh, 11:30.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.249
- [Rachel] Go home Miles.

29:50.021 --> 29:51.388
- That's a good idea.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.293
- Oh, Christ Miles, look at you.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.828
(grumbling)

29:57.830 --> 29:59.963
Come in, I'll call you a cab,

29:59.965 --> 30:01.665
you're not driving like this.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.769
Watch your step.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.090
- You have a nice place here.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.793
- [Rachel] Where's my phone?

30:33.698 --> 30:35.332
- Elizabeth kicked me out.

30:36.634 --> 30:37.701
- What?

30:46.144 --> 30:47.211
When?

30:50.748 --> 30:52.249
- Last week.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.052
Ah, I don't know,

30:55.054 --> 30:56.787
maybe the week before.

31:01.226 --> 31:02.926
She's divorcing me.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.930
For real this time.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.235
Had her lawyer
serve me the papers

31:11.237 --> 31:12.402
and everything.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.740
- I'm so sorry, Miles.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.712
(sighs)

31:25.850 --> 31:27.184
Where are you staying?

31:28.152 --> 31:30.520
(laughs)

31:32.223 --> 31:34.191
- Some shitbag motel.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.493
Over on Forest.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.933
I swear, it feels
like I've arrested

31:42.935 --> 31:45.602
half the people that
hang around that place.

31:47.372 --> 31:49.673
- You can crash on
the couch tonight.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.043
- Thanks.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.047
You are the best.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.021
- Lamar?

32:04.188 --> 32:05.756
- Just a second, we're
attacking the warlocks

32:05.758 --> 32:07.557
in full force.

32:07.992 --> 32:08.959
- This is what you
do right before

32:08.961 --> 32:10.294
you have to go to bed?

32:10.296 --> 32:11.461
- Ah shit!

32:11.463 --> 32:12.896
- Hey, language.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.632
- Sorry, it's just that we
were so close that time.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.635
- You can slaughter warlocks
later, it's bedtime.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.071
Hey, I mean it.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.973
- I know, I'll just
be a few more minutes.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.775
- [Rachel] All
right, good night.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.597
Just three months ago.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.147
What happened to you, Delores?

33:04.149 --> 33:08.852
(foreboding music)

33:17.195 --> 33:22.132
(moaning)

33:23.301 --> 33:28.005
(eerie music)

33:28.007 --> 33:29.172
- And the good
witch turned Greta

33:29.174 --> 33:31.041
back into a princess.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.276
- [Girl with red bow]
I'm tired of this story.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.745
- I know.

33:37.315 --> 33:38.782
- [Girl with red bow] Wait,
Grandma doesn't like us

33:38.784 --> 33:40.183
touching her things.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.085
- She'll never know
unless you tell.

33:43.721 --> 33:46.823
(heaving)

33:56.234 --> 34:00.971
(foreboding music)

34:34.405 --> 34:37.373
(alarm ringing)

35:05.436 --> 35:06.369
(door knocking)

35:06.371 --> 35:07.671
- Lamar?

35:08.005 --> 35:10.674
He better not use all
the hot water again.

35:12.243 --> 35:16.313
(grumbling)

35:21.185 --> 35:22.219
- Rachel?

35:22.221 --> 35:23.453
- Morning.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.757
Wondering where you are?

35:29.060 --> 35:30.594
This would be my living room.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.829
- Oh shit...

35:36.200 --> 35:37.400
- Coffee?

35:38.169 --> 35:40.203
- Ugh, yeah.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.473
Oh shit.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.844
(grumbling)

35:48.713 --> 35:50.180
- You like it black, right?

35:50.815 --> 35:51.982
- Yeah.

35:54.285 --> 35:55.585
Hmm.

35:57.755 --> 35:59.422
You have the good stuff.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.759
- No need to ask
how you're feeling.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.563
- Would it be too much
trouble to ask you

36:06.565 --> 36:08.165
for some aspirin?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.701
- Not at all, I
got some upstairs.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.145
Did you finish your
homework for Ms. Maura?

36:23.514 --> 36:24.881
All of it?

36:25.316 --> 36:26.416
- Uhuh.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.652
- All right, see you downstairs.

36:37.562 --> 36:38.662
- [Miles] Oh fuck.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.663
- Hey.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.066
- Oh, hey.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.234
Sorry.

36:44.236 --> 36:47.470
(phone ringing)

36:47.472 --> 36:48.905
Hang on.

36:54.111 --> 36:56.046
(coughs) O'Connor.

36:57.181 --> 37:00.283
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, soon.

37:01.152 --> 37:04.487
(sighs) Yeah, yeah, yeah,

37:04.489 --> 37:06.223
kiss my ass, James.

37:06.924 --> 37:08.191
- Late for work?

37:10.094 --> 37:13.163
- Nah, seems I got another case.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.433
It's crazy, it's like,

37:17.535 --> 37:19.402
back in Chicago again.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.271
- Could this be a murder?

37:24.175 --> 37:25.575
- Yeah.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.777
Possibly.

37:29.013 --> 37:30.814
Here's nice to a uh,

37:31.716 --> 37:33.883
nice and simple suicide.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.653
- So, you and my Mom?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.588
- [Rachel] We work
together, sweetheart.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.156
- Oh thanks.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.892
- [Rachel] Is that all you're
having for breakfast honey?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.294
I could make you toast and eggs.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.195
- No time.

37:45.197 --> 37:46.396
- [Rachel] A kiss at least?

37:50.134 --> 37:51.067
- [Lamar] Bye Mom.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.102
- Have a good day at school.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.370
- [Lamar] I will.

37:58.042 --> 37:59.476
- He's a nice kid.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.178
- He's way too
cool for Mom, but,

38:02.780 --> 38:05.115
yeah, he's a pretty special guy.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.751
- Yeah, I remember
the Coldman case.

38:08.352 --> 38:09.519
It was brutal.

38:10.554 --> 38:11.855
He was your first, right?

38:11.857 --> 38:13.123
- Third.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.359
- His parents had been
dead almost a week

38:16.361 --> 38:17.861
when we found him.

38:18.663 --> 38:20.664
Seemed to have bounced
back pretty good though.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.166
- Seems that way.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.969
A lot of times though
with childhood trauma,

38:25.971 --> 38:29.406
they bury it so deep inside
it's like it never happened.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.175
And then one day,
all of the sudden,

38:32.177 --> 38:34.544
it just all comes
rushing back at once.

38:35.646 --> 38:36.846
- Yeah.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.816
- I just saw this perfect child

38:39.818 --> 38:42.319
in the middle of all the
horror and destruction.

38:43.421 --> 38:46.389
It really tugged at my
heartstrings though, so,

38:46.391 --> 38:50.393
I called in a few favors,
fast tracked the adoption.

38:51.362 --> 38:52.729
- That's uh...

38:54.131 --> 38:55.899
Really good of you to do that.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.468
- Everybody said
I was crazy, but,

38:59.236 --> 39:02.706
I just couldn't see letting
him go into foster care.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.542
I mean look at poor Zoe.

39:06.143 --> 39:07.444
- Yeah.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.647
- There's probably no
hot water left, but,

39:10.649 --> 39:12.515
if you'd like to take a shower?

39:12.517 --> 39:14.217
- Oh yeah, no.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.885
There's not enough time.

39:16.253 --> 39:17.787
James has been
calling all morning,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.622
it seems we caught
the fresh one, so.

39:19.624 --> 39:20.790
- Okay.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.425
- Hey uh,

39:23.294 --> 39:24.928
last night, we didn't?

39:26.397 --> 39:29.866
I mean, I didn't
like do anything to?

39:30.101 --> 39:31.901
- Make a total ass of yourself?

39:32.603 --> 39:34.637
- Hell I know I did that, but...

39:35.406 --> 39:36.740
- You're fine Miles.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.041
Nothing to be ashamed of,

39:38.043 --> 39:39.642
nothing to brag about.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.645
- All right, good.

39:43.581 --> 39:47.350
So uh, I guess it's
see you later then.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.218
- Later.

39:48.220 --> 39:52.756
(foreboding music)

39:56.494 --> 39:57.761
- [Voiceover] We're sorry,
the number you have dialed

39:57.763 --> 39:59.996
is not in service at this time.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.844
(phone dialing)

40:14.846 --> 40:16.112
- [Voiceover] Child
Protective Services,

40:16.114 --> 40:17.046
this is Sandra.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.715
- Hi Sandra, this is Dr. Stewart

40:18.717 --> 40:20.283
calling for Angie Durant.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.518
- [Voiceover] Hold please.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.586
- [Voiceover] This is Angie.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.355
- Hey Angie, this
is Dr. Stewart,

40:25.357 --> 40:27.857
I'm working with Maricopa
County Homicide right now

40:27.859 --> 40:29.692
on a case involving a minor.

40:29.694 --> 40:34.063
One Zoe Weaver, date
of birth, 9-6-04.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.498
- [Voiceover] Case number?

40:35.500 --> 40:39.369
- Uhm, AZ640213.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.738
- [Voiceover] Okay,
just one second here.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.375
Hmm, nothing's coming up.

40:45.377 --> 40:46.676
What was that number again?

40:46.678 --> 40:51.381
- AZ640213.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.284
- [Voiceover] Let me try again.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.487
Nope, no case files
matching that number.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.822
- Really?

40:58.824 --> 41:00.457
I have it pulled up
right in front of me.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.891
It's Zoe Weaver,

41:01.893 --> 41:04.861
current legal guardians
Catherine and Theodor Holezer.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.997
Former guardians,
Delores and Henry Kelly.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.300
Uh the number I have
for them is no good.

41:10.302 --> 41:14.971
But the address is
860 North Range Road,

41:14.973 --> 41:17.540
looks like it's in
a town called Riley.

41:19.510 --> 41:21.277
- [Voiceover] I've just
ran a name search as well,

41:21.279 --> 41:23.246
and the only Zoe
Weaver that comes back

41:23.248 --> 41:25.381
is from a case in 1992.

41:26.684 --> 41:29.786
- This is crazy, I'm gonna
send you the link right now.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.288
Hang on.

41:33.357 --> 41:35.558
Ugh, now the page isn't loading.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.726
- [Voiceover] It could
be a server issue,

41:36.728 --> 41:38.595
but everything seems
to be working fine

41:38.597 --> 41:39.729
on my end.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.264
- Okay, well thanks
for your time.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.666
- [Voiceover] Sorry I
couldn't be of anymore help.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.101
- Not a problem.

41:45.636 --> 41:47.203
- [Voiceover] Have
a great day, doctor.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.905
- You too, bye.

42:08.826 --> 42:13.530
(foreboding music)

42:24.041 --> 42:26.809
- Well, so much for the
simple suicide, huh?

42:26.811 --> 42:28.077
What do we got?

42:28.079 --> 42:29.646
- Same MO as the last one.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.849
Small contained burn.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.684
No obvious point of origin,

42:34.686 --> 42:36.953
no explainable accelerance.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.122
Consistent in the fact
that I can't give you

42:39.124 --> 42:40.924
a single useful answer.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.859
- James, do you have any idea?

42:43.294 --> 42:44.294
- Yeah.

42:45.429 --> 42:46.729
Get a load of this.

42:47.097 --> 42:48.965
- Joseph Mooney, RN.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.668
Mercy Immanuel.

42:52.102 --> 42:53.603
- Pediatrics unit.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.106
- That's Zoe Weaver's unit.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.274
- Hmm-mm.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.449
- [Miles] Hey
Rachel, it's Miles,

43:06.451 --> 43:08.151
come as soon as you
get this, all right?

43:09.720 --> 43:11.454
We've gotta get something
from the Weaver kid.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.089
Any way we can.

43:13.091 --> 43:17.493
(foreboding music)

43:31.742 --> 43:32.842
- Hello?

44:08.979 --> 44:10.246
(door knocking)

44:11.315 --> 44:12.081
(gun cocks)

44:12.083 --> 44:13.483
Oh my God, please!

44:13.485 --> 44:15.084
- Who are you?

44:15.719 --> 44:17.153
- I'm Dr. Rachel Stewart,

44:17.155 --> 44:19.188
I'm with Maricopa
County Homicide.

44:19.623 --> 44:20.823
- You a cop?

44:20.825 --> 44:23.192
- I'm a doctor, I
work with the police.

44:23.961 --> 44:25.194
- What do you want?

44:26.764 --> 44:29.065
- I'm looking for
Delores or Henry Kelly?

44:29.067 --> 44:30.600
- What for?

44:31.935 --> 44:33.936
- I need to ask them about
their former foster child,

44:33.938 --> 44:35.338
Zoe Weaver.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.285
- Mama?

44:50.854 --> 44:53.156
This lady here is
from the police.

44:53.158 --> 44:55.258
She wants to talk
to you about Zoe.

44:59.263 --> 45:00.496
- Ms. Kelly.

45:02.666 --> 45:03.833
My name is Rachel Stewart,

45:03.835 --> 45:05.935
I'm with Maricopa
County Homicide.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.578
Ms. Kelly I'd like to
discuss your former ward,

45:15.580 --> 45:16.879
Zoe Weaver.

45:16.881 --> 45:20.283
(weeping)

45:20.285 --> 45:22.452
- He was a good man.

45:23.387 --> 45:24.954
Not perfect.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.058
But Lord knows he
didn't deserve to die...

45:29.060 --> 45:32.862
(crying)

45:35.933 --> 45:37.133
- [Son] Don't worry.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.294
What?

46:06.230 --> 46:07.730
- I didn't say anything.

46:09.299 --> 46:11.100
- There's nothing
wrong with my coffee.

46:12.002 --> 46:13.569
- No, of course not.

46:15.973 --> 46:17.540
It's very good, thank you.

46:18.375 --> 46:20.810
So it's just the
two of you here?

46:21.378 --> 46:23.246
- Why do you wanna
know about Zoe?

46:23.814 --> 46:25.581
- She might have been
a witness to something,

46:25.583 --> 46:28.584
but, I'm having a hard time
getting through to her.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.520
I thought maybe--

46:30.522 --> 46:31.954
- I'm not surprised she grew
up to be hell on wheels,

46:31.956 --> 46:34.657
shit, she sure was
that way 20 years ago,

46:34.659 --> 46:36.425
when she came to stay with us.

46:36.427 --> 46:37.660
- There must be some mix up,

46:37.662 --> 46:39.695
I'm talking about Zoe Weaver.

46:39.697 --> 46:41.464
- The blond-haired devil child.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.636
- But we must be talking
about different people.

46:46.638 --> 46:48.037
The girl that I'm
talking about--

46:48.039 --> 46:49.272
- [Son] Here it is.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.752
- This is impossible.

47:03.587 --> 47:05.321
- I don't even
know why I kept it.

47:05.756 --> 47:08.524
I only have so few
pictures of my Momma happy.

47:09.359 --> 47:10.660
- When was this taken?

47:11.161 --> 47:12.662
- Before Daddy died, so uh,

47:12.664 --> 47:15.298
what, it had to be '91 or '92.

47:15.966 --> 47:18.467
- That was more
than 20 years ago.

47:20.270 --> 47:22.338
- Last time this
was a happy home.

47:26.610 --> 47:28.177
- The girl in the picture?

47:28.679 --> 47:30.046
- Yeah, Zoe.

47:30.647 --> 47:31.647
- No...

47:31.982 --> 47:33.049
No, it can't be.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.984
- Must've been taken a month,

47:34.986 --> 47:37.620
maybe two, before
they found my daddy.

47:39.256 --> 47:40.656
Rough way to go.

47:41.491 --> 47:42.291
I only hope he was dead

47:42.293 --> 47:43.826
before the fire got him.

47:45.462 --> 47:47.129
- He was burned?

47:47.131 --> 47:48.798
- To a cinder.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.434
Mama swears it was Zoe.

47:51.436 --> 47:53.169
Crazy as that sounds,

47:53.171 --> 47:55.338
that child had the devil in her.

47:58.976 --> 48:00.776
- Can I get a picture of this?

48:01.345 --> 48:02.011
- Sure.

48:02.013 --> 48:06.282
(ominous music)

48:19.496 --> 48:21.464
- Did Zoe have any toys,

48:21.466 --> 48:24.000
like strange little dolls?

48:25.636 --> 48:27.203
- You mean the Krampus?

48:27.205 --> 48:29.705
She never parted with
that ugly little thing.

48:29.707 --> 48:31.007
And threw a fit,
something awful,

48:31.009 --> 48:33.109
if Momma ever tried
to take it from her.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.379
So no, it don't surprise
me she'd still have it.

48:41.551 --> 48:43.052
Merry Christmas now.

48:45.055 --> 48:47.056
And watch your back with Zoe.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.219
- Why are you staring at me?

49:17.654 --> 49:20.022
I don't stare at you even
though your face is ugly.

49:20.557 --> 49:21.691
- I'm sorry.

49:24.928 --> 49:26.329
- [Zoe] What happened?

49:26.763 --> 49:27.997
- What?

49:28.765 --> 49:31.067
- How did your face
get so messed up?

49:31.535 --> 49:32.868
- It was a fire.

49:33.270 --> 49:34.270
- You started it?

49:34.272 --> 49:35.304
- [Burned girl] No.

49:35.306 --> 49:36.539
- How then?

49:38.208 --> 49:38.908
Tell me!

49:38.910 --> 49:40.376
- Why?

49:40.378 --> 49:43.112
- Because if you tell me I
might be able to help you.

49:44.147 --> 49:45.715
- What do you mean?

49:46.583 --> 49:47.783
- Fire.

49:49.086 --> 49:52.021
It's not your friend,
but it's mine.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.061
It was your parents?

49:59.063 --> 50:00.162
- My dad.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.364
- He burned you?

50:01.898 --> 50:03.165
He made you ugly forever!

50:03.167 --> 50:04.867
- He didn't mean to.

50:05.802 --> 50:07.236
I just fell asleep.

50:07.238 --> 50:08.871
- And now you're ugly.

50:09.239 --> 50:10.740
How does that make you feel?

50:11.274 --> 50:12.375
- [Burned girl] I...

50:12.943 --> 50:13.709
I...

50:13.711 --> 50:16.045
- Go on, tell me.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.279
- I don't want to.

50:17.281 --> 50:18.647
- Go away then!

50:27.657 --> 50:28.891
- Zoe?

50:30.093 --> 50:31.961
Ashley said that
you made her cry.

50:32.829 --> 50:34.430
That you called her ugly.

50:34.432 --> 50:35.498
Is that true?

50:35.500 --> 50:36.999
- She is ugly.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.768
- Zoe!

50:39.202 --> 50:40.836
We don't talk to
people like that.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.838
We don't say things that
hurt people's feelings

50:42.840 --> 50:44.206
and make them cry.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.908
- You've been crying too.

50:45.910 --> 50:47.410
Crying for Joe.

50:47.978 --> 50:49.311
You shouldn't cry for him.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.347
He was a bad man.

50:57.087 --> 50:58.521
- I'll give this back to you,

50:58.523 --> 51:00.823
when you learn to
speak to people nicely.

51:04.394 --> 51:09.065
(foreboding music)

51:14.304 --> 51:15.204
- Hey, where have you been,

51:15.206 --> 51:16.138
I've been calling all day!

51:16.140 --> 51:17.973
- Miles, we need to talk.

51:18.642 --> 51:21.377
What I have to tell you
seems impossible, but...

51:21.379 --> 51:22.645
- [Miles] We found another body.

51:22.647 --> 51:23.913
- What?

51:24.414 --> 51:25.915
- Just like the Holezers case.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.017
Nothing but ashes left.

51:28.652 --> 51:30.352
- [Rachel] Oh my God, who?

51:30.354 --> 51:31.921
- Joseph Mooney.

51:32.522 --> 51:34.690
A nurse, at Mercy Immanuel.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.425
Children's ward.

51:39.896 --> 51:40.996
Rachel?

51:42.299 --> 51:43.499
- I'm here.

51:44.034 --> 51:45.501
- [Miles] What
are the odds, huh?

51:45.503 --> 51:46.635
- There's more.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.003
- [Miles] What do you mean?

51:48.005 --> 51:50.005
- I just paid a visit
to Delores Kelly,

51:50.007 --> 51:51.941
Zoe Weaver's former
foster mother.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.311
- (sighs) Yeah, and?

51:55.313 --> 51:57.880
- [Rachel] This is
gonna sound crazy.

51:58.548 --> 52:00.950
- Hey, it's been two
solid days of crazy.

52:01.351 --> 52:04.253
Okay, our top priority is
getting something from Zoe.

52:05.388 --> 52:07.756
Rachel, are you hearing me?

52:08.425 --> 52:10.659
(mumbling), with this kid?

52:11.962 --> 52:13.863
You need to get
something from her today.

52:14.231 --> 52:15.431
And I don't care
what you gotta do,

52:15.433 --> 52:17.800
if you gotta use a
crowbar, (mumbling).

52:18.268 --> 52:19.034
- Okay.

52:19.036 --> 52:20.469
Mercy Immanuel then.

52:20.904 --> 52:22.338
- [Miles] I'll meet you there.

52:34.117 --> 52:35.551
- Sir, you can't
smoke that here.

52:35.553 --> 52:36.719
- What?

52:36.721 --> 52:37.987
- This is a hospital
sir, there's no smoking

52:37.989 --> 52:39.989
on the property or
the parking lot.

52:41.391 --> 52:42.958
- All right, sorry.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.935
- [James] I thought you quit.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.205
- Hey James.

52:57.307 --> 52:59.542
- I uhm, just spoke
to the datatechs

52:59.544 --> 53:01.277
that State Police sent over.

53:02.612 --> 53:04.046
- Yeah, those fuckers.

53:04.048 --> 53:05.514
- Ah, they're all right.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.716
I mean we're all supposed
to be on the same team

53:07.718 --> 53:09.118
or something, right?

53:10.520 --> 53:12.288
- Yeah, something.

53:13.223 --> 53:14.557
- Anyway, get this.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.225
I had 'em search his
computer for any recent

53:16.227 --> 53:17.593
web activity.

53:18.628 --> 53:20.863
Turns on Mooney, had the largest

53:20.865 --> 53:22.097
collection of kiddie
porn these guys

53:22.099 --> 53:23.666
had ever come across.

53:24.301 --> 53:26.602
- (groans) Sick bastard.

53:27.404 --> 53:28.671
- Yeah.

53:29.239 --> 53:30.706
They say there's a whole
underground network

53:30.708 --> 53:33.475
of these freaks that trade
the stuff like baseball cards.

53:34.945 --> 53:36.979
- All right, so how
does this connect to Zoe

53:36.981 --> 53:38.647
and the Holezers case?

53:38.649 --> 53:40.115
- I don't know if it does.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.018
Either way, the captain
is gonna be pissed,

53:43.020 --> 53:44.920
and now with this whole
child porn in the mix,

53:44.922 --> 53:47.323
there's no way he's
keeping the Feds away.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.296
- Here she is.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.468
- Gentlemen.

54:01.371 --> 54:02.471
Child porn?

54:02.473 --> 54:03.872
- Terabytes of the stuff.

54:03.874 --> 54:04.773
- God...

54:04.775 --> 54:06.175
- I just can't believe it.

54:06.177 --> 54:07.977
- How well did you
know Mr. Mooney?

54:07.979 --> 54:10.980
- I mean not well,
not socially anyway.

54:11.681 --> 54:13.215
But I liked him.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.017
I mean we all did.

54:15.452 --> 54:17.453
I just can't believe he could
be involved in something

54:17.455 --> 54:18.621
like that.

54:30.033 --> 54:31.133
- You're up.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.575
- Zoe, we need to talk.

54:47.350 --> 54:48.417
What are you drawing?

54:48.419 --> 54:50.252
- This is not gonna work.

54:51.721 --> 54:53.656
Do you have any yarn?

54:53.658 --> 54:55.591
- No, I'm sorry, I don't.

54:56.059 --> 54:58.627
- It has to be a dolly
or it's not gonna work.

54:59.763 --> 55:01.130
- Who's the man in the drawing?

55:01.132 --> 55:02.698
- He's stupid!

55:11.808 --> 55:14.576
Bring me some yarn and I'll
tell you what you wanna know.

55:15.211 --> 55:16.712
- You know what I wanna ask you?

55:16.714 --> 55:17.913
- [Zoe] Yes.

55:19.416 --> 55:20.883
- Okay, how about this?

55:20.885 --> 55:22.985
If you agree to answer
a few of my questions,

55:22.987 --> 55:24.753
I promise I'll
bring you some yarn.

55:27.090 --> 55:28.223
(sighs)

55:29.959 --> 55:31.226
- Okay.

55:32.495 --> 55:35.631
- I saw Ms. Kelly today,
do you remember her?

55:36.099 --> 55:37.333
- Delores?

55:37.600 --> 55:39.301
Yes, I remember her.

55:39.936 --> 55:41.937
She was nice, but Henry wasn't.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.138
- Mr. Kelly?

55:43.140 --> 55:44.573
Your foster father?

55:45.075 --> 55:47.876
- Was, now he's gone.

55:47.878 --> 55:49.812
- Like Mr. and Ms. Holezer.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.046
- And Joe.

55:51.048 --> 55:53.682
He was bad, now he's gone too.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.352
- Zoe, you know it's impossible
that you could've known

55:56.354 --> 55:59.555
Mr. Kelly, he disappeared
years before you were born.

56:00.957 --> 56:02.658
- I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.760
- Well, I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

56:04.762 --> 56:05.894
The police are
looking for the person

56:05.896 --> 56:07.129
who's been hurting people,

56:07.131 --> 56:08.931
and they think you might
be able to help them.

56:10.100 --> 56:11.467
- It's Christmas time.

56:12.035 --> 56:14.236
Do you know what happens
at Christmas time?

56:14.604 --> 56:15.938
- Santa Claus comes.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.806
- Santa Claus isn't real.

56:18.274 --> 56:20.142
- Okay, what happens?

56:20.810 --> 56:22.745
- Nothing, if you're good.

56:23.513 --> 56:24.947
- And what if you're bad?

56:27.650 --> 56:30.285
Zoe, what happens
to the bad people?

56:30.287 --> 56:33.088
Is it Krampus, is he
the one that hurts them?

56:33.090 --> 56:34.923
Isn't that what you
told me yesterday?

56:34.925 --> 56:36.558
- Yarn first, no more questions!

56:36.560 --> 56:38.026
- No, Zoe, you have to help--

56:38.028 --> 56:39.361
(screaming)

56:39.363 --> 56:41.997
- [Zoe] Put me down, let me go!

56:41.999 --> 56:44.233
- [Tom] Nurse, please
take her to her room.

56:44.235 --> 56:46.034
- Put me down!

56:46.036 --> 56:47.536
Put me down!

56:47.538 --> 56:50.172
Stop it, let me go!

56:50.174 --> 56:53.041
Put me down!

56:54.043 --> 56:55.511
Let me go!

56:55.513 --> 56:57.479
- Zoe that's quite enough.

57:02.585 --> 57:03.685
Now.

57:05.789 --> 57:07.122
Are you going to be okay

57:07.124 --> 57:10.159
if I let Mr. Travis let you go?

57:16.533 --> 57:18.333
I don't know what's
got into you.

57:19.335 --> 57:22.104
We cannot have anymore
outbursts like that, Zoe.

57:22.106 --> 57:24.072
You hurt Dr. Stewart.

57:24.507 --> 57:25.841
- She yelled at me.

57:25.843 --> 57:28.277
- That's because she
has questions for you.

57:28.745 --> 57:30.679
Questions concerning
what may have happened

57:30.681 --> 57:32.247
to your foster parents.

57:32.249 --> 57:33.882
- But I've already told her.

57:33.884 --> 57:35.517
It was Krampus.

57:36.586 --> 57:37.886
- Krampus.

57:39.856 --> 57:41.190
And Krampus always
hurts the people

57:41.192 --> 57:42.758
you don't like?

57:43.359 --> 57:46.295
- No, he only hurts bad people.

57:46.297 --> 57:48.730
People like Joe, and Katie,

57:48.732 --> 57:50.199
and Teddy.

57:54.270 --> 57:55.604
- Mr. Travis, thank you.

57:55.606 --> 57:57.539
If you can wait outside for us.

58:00.977 --> 58:02.478
Zoe have a seat.

58:12.489 --> 58:15.257
You know lots of children
have imaginary friends.

58:16.726 --> 58:18.227
And that's okay.

58:21.331 --> 58:24.099
But Krampus is more
than imaginary to you,

58:25.201 --> 58:26.502
isn't he?

58:29.105 --> 58:30.339
- But it's okay.

58:30.807 --> 58:32.241
You don't need to be afraid.

58:33.042 --> 58:35.410
Krampus knows you're not
one of the bad people.

58:39.148 --> 58:41.450
- Look, why don't
you get some rest?

58:42.151 --> 58:44.086
You're probably just overtired.

58:44.088 --> 58:48.257
(eerie music)

59:09.379 --> 59:10.045
- That's just--

59:10.047 --> 59:11.513
- Crazy, I know.

59:12.482 --> 59:14.783
But according to Andrew
Kelly, this picture

59:14.785 --> 59:17.219
was taken over 20 years ago.

59:17.587 --> 59:18.720
You see that?

59:19.622 --> 59:20.956
- Looks like Zoe.

59:24.527 --> 59:25.661
Thanks, Brian.

59:29.198 --> 59:30.966
Hey uh, it could be a fake.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.136
Maybe this guy is crazy

59:34.138 --> 59:36.638
or maybe he's having
some fun with you.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.240
- I don't think so.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.076
- All right, so what?

59:42.245 --> 59:44.246
You're saying our little Zoe

59:44.248 --> 59:47.182
is actually a woman in her 30s.

59:47.617 --> 59:51.053
With an imaginary
friend who kills people

59:51.055 --> 59:52.788
by burning them alive?

59:54.424 --> 59:56.925
That's a little
far-fetched even for me.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.193
- I know.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:00.829
- Another beer?

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.298
- Uh, Patron Silver please.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.836
It's not just that.

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.005
- Then what?

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.974
- I can't shake this feeling

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.976
that I've met her before.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.418
- Wow.

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:24.853
- What?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.755
That's more like it.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.324
- Yeah, you're breaking
out the big guns here, Doc.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.792
- Oh, you're one to talk.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.528
- Oh hey, I'm not
criticizing, so.

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:35.530
But if you wanna drink with me

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:37.499
it's gonna have to be Jameson.

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:39.901
Brian, two Jameson.

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.541
- You scared me.

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.678
What do you want?

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.081
- I'm sorry I made you cry.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.787
I made this for you.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.456
- What is it?

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:03.225
- You'll see.

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:07.696
(foreboding music)

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:15.504
(calming guitar music)

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.739
- Let's get one more, Brian.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.210
- I think that you
ought to slow down.

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:23.812
- Really?

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:27.049
Detective O'Connor,
did I just hear you

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.484
tell me to slow down?

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.555
If I recall correctly,

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:37.693
it was you passed out
on my couch last night.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.027
(laughs)

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.530
- Fair enough.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.102
Ho, where are you going?

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.072
- Ladies room.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.841
- All right.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.953
- Man, you got a tight
little package there.

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.156
- Excuse me?

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.425
- I don't like those
professional types,

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:13.061
they know how to play it

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.964
to keep us guessing, am I right?

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.734
- Yeah, sure.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:20.969
- Now, don't,

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.405
don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.776
No doubt she's got
a tight little body

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.611
under all of that.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.614
And she's just not showing you.

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.586
It keeps the mystery alive.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.721
- We're coworkers.

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:43.658
- Yeah, you just let me know,

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.429
if you need a hand,
coworking her over.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.804
- What's your name, friend?

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:57.973
- Clay.

01:02:57.975 --> 01:02:59.374
- Last name.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.744
- What, are you writing a book?

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:04.679
- [Miles] Simple
question, is all.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.420
- Fuck off, that's my name.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.092
- Elsworth.

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.961
Yeah...

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.231
Clayton Elsworth.

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.066
The drunk bum who fell asleep

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:28.136
with a lit cigarette, and
burned his house down.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:30.939
Your daughter was
lucky to barely escape

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.174
with her life.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.242
- You got a mouth
on you, mister.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:35.877
- Fellas, please.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.847
- You're that cop asshole.

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:44.119
- Yeah, that would be me.

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.988
- Miles, what's going on?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.391
- Nothing to worry your
head about, little missy.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.027
It's just your boyfriend
is the kind of fella

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.529
who's mouth will get
him into trouble.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.298
- Ah time to go.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.936
(foreboding music)

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.075
- You have yourself a nice
evening, Mr. Elsworth.

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.146
Just don't go burning
anymore little girls now.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:17.752
(eerie music)

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.829
- Another double.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.139
(giggling)

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.777
- We need music.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.748
(romantic music)

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.483
- Hey Rachel I really
think I should probably go.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:50.652
- Ssshht!

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:54.055
Oh, I love this one.

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.458
Dance with me, Miles.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.361
Come on, Miles,

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:01.329
dance with me.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.933
- Dancing is not
really my thing.

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:06.134
- Whoo!

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.806
It's just dancing.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.912
- So this is dancing?

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.688
(laughs)

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:37.599
- You are a very good dancer.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.669
- All right...

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.337
- Hmm-mm.

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:46.808
(romantic music)

01:05:57.153 --> 01:06:00.155
(choking)

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.462
- Oh, I need a goddamn lighter.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:43.498
Ah.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.105
Ah, merry fucking Christmas.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.321
What the fuck?

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:07.956
Oh God.

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:10.525
(anticipating music)

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:13.194
Ah, ah shit, ah!

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:21.703
(screaming)

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:32.814
(growling)

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.023
- You feel better?

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:43.858
- Yeah.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.493
Just tired.

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:47.996
- Yeah that's the thing
about Mr. Jameson.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.532
If you're not careful,
he'll sneak up on you.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.371
You never told me
how you got this.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.307
- It's nothing I can remember.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.776
Not clearly anyway.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.446
I've had it since
I was really young.

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:05.747
- Hmm...

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.716
- It's always
bothered me though.

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:11.786
- What, that you don't
remember how you got the scar?

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.855
- I don't remember
anything about my childhood

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:15.924
before the Stewarts took me in.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.295
- What like repressed
memories or something?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.764
- Maybe, I mean,
we're not supposed to

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.899
self-diagnose, but...

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.138
It's all a blur.

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.675
I get flashes.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:36.176
Dreams sometimes.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.481
Bob and Dina were no help.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.050
- Was that your foster parents?

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.551
- Hmm-mm.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.455
Yeah, I asked Mom about it
a few times before she died.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:50.925
She always changed the
subject very quickly.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.761
Dad was even worse.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.163
- Worse, how?

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:57.932
- Well he'd never say
anything about it,

01:08:57.934 --> 01:09:01.603
but, the look he would
get if I brought it up,

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:04.738
he was terrified.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.376
Anyway.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.247
I know my birth
parents died in a fire.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.250
I have this scar.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.752
Nothing else.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:23.091
No reports, no records.

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.560
Nothing I've been
able to find anyway.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:26.961
- Well that's...

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.800
Weird though, I would
think with your access,

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.335
you would've found something.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.703
- Nothing.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.471
Which is next to
impossible unless someone

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:39.640
destroyed the records.

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.810
- Yeah but, who's gonna do that?

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.081
- It's like everything
from before.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.819
Who I was, who my parents were.

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.355
They're just gone.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.292
(rumbling)

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:00.828
- Hi Mom.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.064
- I thought you were
staying at Jason's?

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.632
- His WiFi is down.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.067
- Ah...

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.237
Well...

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.638
- Yeah.

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.106
Guess I should go.

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:13.908
- You can stay
here if you'd like,

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.144
there's the couch or...

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.614
- I should probably
get back to the motel.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.150
If I'm not back soon,
the junkies around there

01:10:22.152 --> 01:10:24.953
will probably (mumbling),

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:27.288
or something (mumbling).

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.591
- Understood.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.561
- You okay?

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:40.868
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:42.704
Another time.

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.341
- Okay.

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:07.795
(foreboding music)

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:09.297
- It's time, Rachel.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:14.502
(heaving)

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.974
- And for those who
have been wicked

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.744
with the year's end approaching,
saw to it that the Krampus

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.946
prepared to cast
them into the fire.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.414
- [Girl with red bow]
What does that mean?

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:27.415
- What do you think?

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:28.650
Krampus killed them.

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:29.984
- [Girl with red bow]
That can't be true.

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.986
- [Girl with black hair]
Wait, there's more here.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:32.954
- [Girl with red bow] What?

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.289
- Listen to this.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.125
But Saint Nicholas grew
angry with the Krampus,

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:40.361
and to punish him had the
chains of civility forged.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.797
The chains made the Krampus
the servant of the Saint

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.732
and he could no
longer punish at will,

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:47.869
but would now only punish those
of Nicholas' his choosing.

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:52.240
- [Girl with red bow]
Then what happened?

01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:54.942
- There's a picture here, but
the letters make no sense.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:59.447
(ominous music)

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:04.285
(speaking foreign language)

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:11.392
(speaking foreign language)

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:12.627
(growling)

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:15.530
Chains that bind you,
now bind you to me.

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:20.268
(growling)

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:25.139
(eerie music)

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:41.456
(moaning)

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:46.394
(anticipating music)

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:18.126
(growling)

01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:22.630
(screaming)

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.934
- [Krampus] Rachel.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.936
- No!

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:32.740
(screaming)

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:37.779
(weeping)

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:59.567
(sad music)

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:19.454
(puking)

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:32.934
(weeping)

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:37.505
(anticipating music)

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.836
(screaming)

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.140
Lamar?

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.244
- There's someone in here!

01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:17.678
(screaming)

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.083
(anticipating music)

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.810
- It's okay sweetie,
it's just...

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.078
- Who was that?

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:51.946
- Zoe!

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:53.447
- Who is Zoe?

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:57.919
Mom look out!

01:15:57.921 --> 01:15:59.487
- We've gotta get to the police.

01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:00.488
- Police?

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.323
- Police, Miles, just,

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:03.758
Lamar I really need
to concentrate,

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.126
I need you to be quiet.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.631
- You can't go this way!

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:12.800
(screaming)

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:13.935
(car crashing)

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:18.372
(humming)
(sad music)

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:40.027
- And he punishes all the
wicked little boys and girls

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:42.830
with the fire, and the
fire is what cleanses

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.465
the world of evil.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.435
- What are you doing?

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:48.936
- Go back to bed.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:55.309
(sad music)

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:04.986
(screaming)

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:08.789
- Rachel make it
stop, please, stop!

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.726
(laughing)

01:17:11.728 --> 01:17:13.661
(foreboding music)

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:14.795
(gasps)

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:30.578
(gasps)

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:08.716
(foreboding music)

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:12.580
- [Left nurse] How is she doing?

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.982
- Stable, it's the kid
we're worried about.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:19.653
(foreboding music)

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.422
(weeping)

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:56.724
- Lamar?

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.628
Lamar?

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:02.797
Lamar?

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:07.301
(crying)

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.405
No...

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.742
No...

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:20.381
- [Zoe] Hello Rachel.

01:20:20.383 --> 01:20:22.149
- [Rachel] (gasps) Zoe!

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.552
- He's gonna die, Rachel.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.921
And it's all your fault.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:27.988
- What?

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.492
(ominous music)

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.060
- [Tom] Damn, he's crashing.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.995
Nurse, defibrillator.

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:46.874
Three, two, one...

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:47.842
Clear!

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.710
Damn, damn, again.

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:51.245
- [Male nurse] Charging.

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:52.913
- The Krampus came for you.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:55.716
He came for you
because you were bad.

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:57.651
- What are you talking about?

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:00.120
- You killed us.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.424
Mommy, Daddy and me.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.226
- I didn't.

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:07.361
- You don't remember?

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.963
Just a bad dream you thought?

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.432
Just a nightmare
like all the others?

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.836
- [Tom] All right,
three, two, one.

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:16.804
Clear!

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.507
Damn it!

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:22.943
We've got to stabilize him.

01:21:22.945 --> 01:21:26.213
(flat-lining)

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.749
One, two, three, four, five,

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:29.984
six...

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.819
Stay with me, Lamar.

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:33.954
- Don't you remember the fire?

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.191
What are you doing?

01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.526
(growling)
(screaming)

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.996
Don't you remember what you did?

01:21:41.998 --> 01:21:44.698
- And the fire is what
cleanses the world of evil.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.500
- No please, stop!

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.535
Remember?

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.137
- It was just--

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:51.338
- You can't remember the Krampus

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.107
or the story from
Grandmother's book?

01:21:53.109 --> 01:21:56.143
- Chains that bind you,
now bind you to me.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.344
(growling)

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:59.146
- Or how you would
make Mommy cry?

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.883
Can you not even remember
you had a sister?

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:07.121
- [Tom] One, two,
three, four, five,

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:09.056
six, seven, eight.

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:12.293
One, two, three, four, five,

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:14.128
six, seven...

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:16.363
- [Male nurse] He's gone, doc.

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:19.967
(flat-lining)

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:30.444
(weeping)

01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:32.379
- So it was you?

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:35.215
- It's not me that
wants you, Rachel.

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:40.854
(growling)

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:42.957
- Krampus?

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:46.627
(growling)

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.562
Please...

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:52.866
(growling)

01:22:52.868 --> 01:22:54.468
- [Male nurse] Doc, he's back!

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.104
- He's coming back?

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.109
I don't believe it.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.445
Lamar stay with us.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.781
- [Voiceover] Dr.
Jennings, (mumbling).

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.584
- Rachel...

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:15.189
(foreboding music)

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.325
(screaming)

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.340
(calm Christmas music)

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.342
- Ho, ho, ho!

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:39.113
And this one's for, Jamie!

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.415
- [Female assistant]
What do you say, Jamie?

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:42.916
- Thank you Santa.

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:45.352
- And this one,

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.454
Lamar!

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.160
- He looks good.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:55.295
- Yes, full recovery.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:24:00.034
But I'll tell you, it's the
closest thing I've ever seen.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:03.937
I mean he was gone
for sure, but...

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:09.676
I'm sorry about Rachel.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.819
- No answer for me on that one?

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.789
- No good ones I'm afraid.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.124
And the Weaver kid?

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.462
- No.

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.398
No sign of her.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.635
Yeah, she's not here,

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:36.937
there's no record
of her anymore,

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.007
it's like she just--

01:24:40.009 --> 01:24:41.141
- Vanished?

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.444
- Yeah.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.014
- But people don't just vanish.

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:49.716
Do they detective?

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.687
- No, Doctor.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.291
They don't.

01:24:57.293 --> 01:25:02.362
(foreboding music)

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.944
I don't know if I have
the words for this.

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:28.622
Goodbye Rachel.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:33.026
(foreboding music)

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:23.010
¶ Rest good children on your bed

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:28.448
¶ Ye have not to thread

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:33.387
¶ But if you happen

01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:36.256
¶ Not to sleep

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:41.295
¶ Then ye have much to fear

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:47.801
¶ He knows about
the naughty ones

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:54.174
¶ Who make their mommies cry

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:59.112
¶ And if you cannot (mumbling)

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:01.882
¶ You can't hide

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:06.653
¶ He sees your evil side

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:13.160
¶ And it isn't above you

01:27:13.162 --> 01:27:17.831
¶ To take and thus prepare

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:23.203
¶ To take the naughty children

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:27.007
¶ Down into his lair

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:32.346
¶ If he (mumbling)

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:36.917
¶ And cast them into the fire

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:42.956
¶ And perhaps he (mumbling)

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:46.960
¶ Of ye all, of ye all

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:50.497
¶ To perhaps be

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:54.968
¶ Above thee all ¶
