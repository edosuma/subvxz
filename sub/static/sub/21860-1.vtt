00:00.801 --> 00:02.536
Hey.

00:02.570 --> 00:05.239
If I buy you a drink,
does that mean you have to
go down on me?

00:05.273 --> 00:08.008
'Cause, you know...
feminism.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:18.686 --> 00:23.824
* Mother, you had me

00:23.857 --> 00:28.696
* But I never had you

00:28.729 --> 00:30.564
*

00:32.766 --> 00:36.670
* I wanted you

00:38.406 --> 00:43.344
* You didn't want me.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.513
*

00:46.180 --> 00:48.382
(sighs)

00:51.385 --> 00:54.054
(sighs)

00:55.389 --> 00:57.558
(chuckles softly)

00:58.726 --> 01:01.262
(sighs)

01:12.406 --> 01:14.475
(sighs)

01:28.889 --> 01:31.559
(squelching)

01:35.263 --> 01:37.598
("September"
by Earth, Wind & Fire Playing)

01:41.902 --> 01:43.404
* Do you remember

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
Hi!

01:44.838 --> 01:47.341
Mmm. Sam, the chicken things
are amazing.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.677
Oh, good!
Is that chicken?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.146
I thought it was tofu.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.747
(chuckles)

01:53.781 --> 01:57.285
* Away

01:57.318 --> 01:59.887
* Our hearts were ringing

01:59.920 --> 02:03.191
* In the key
that our souls were singing *

02:03.224 --> 02:07.195
* As we danced in the night,
remember *

02:07.228 --> 02:09.463
* How the stars stole
the night away *

02:09.497 --> 02:10.731
(sighs)

02:10.764 --> 02:12.466
Frankie, where's
your sister?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.667
Which one?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.369
The shitty one.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.305
Uh, she's not here yet.
I don't know where she is.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.373
Okay, can you text her and
ask her when she's coming?

02:19.407 --> 02:21.242
No.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.744
* Ba de ya

02:23.777 --> 02:24.945
* Never was a cloudy day

02:24.978 --> 02:26.680
(groans)

02:26.714 --> 02:28.682
Sammy.
Hey, Jeff.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.818
I brought beers.
Oh.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.621
Well, you're probably gonna
drink all of that yourself.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.623
Yeah. Probably.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.824
Yeah.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.493
You doing all right there?

02:39.527 --> 02:40.894
Not really.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.231
Yeah, well...

02:43.264 --> 02:44.632
Oh, my sliders.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.267
Oh, sliders, nice.
Yeah.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.835
Bring it.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.903
I'll give you one.
I mean, do you
not even have,

02:49.937 --> 02:52.606
like, some carrot sticks
or something simple?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.408
Oh, God.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.577
Why don't you just eat the food
I made? I made lots of food.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.913
Or if I just wanted
a carrot stick.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.515
Or you could eat
whatever you want,

03:01.549 --> 03:03.784
even though I made guac
and chips

03:03.817 --> 03:05.653
and chicken thingies
and lamb sliders

03:05.686 --> 03:08.356
and two different kinds
of paella.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.358
Okay. I'm sorry.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.293
I will eat what you made.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.462
No, no.
I'm just messing with you.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.597
Just go in the fridge,
get whatever you want.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.732
You're not messing with me,
are you? But that's fine.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.302
Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.637
* Ba de ya

03:23.671 --> 03:24.972
* Never was a cloudy day

03:25.005 --> 03:26.907
You guys want
a lamb slider?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.976
Mmm.
I don't know, it depends.
Did you make it?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.246
You know I made it.
All right.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.748
Which side did your genes come
from? Was your mother beautiful?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.984
No, no, no. My mother was plain.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.619
I got it
from my father.

03:38.652 --> 03:42.022
His mother, my grandmother,
was devastating.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.791
Such a beauty.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.025
And does Sam look like her?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.427
Oh, no.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.496
Sam looks like my mother.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.030
Not like her dad?

03:50.063 --> 03:53.000
Well, Sam's father was
the ugliest man I ever saw

03:53.033 --> 03:54.302
in my life.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.503
Oh, yes, he was spectacular.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.837
That's why I noticed him.
(chuckles)

03:56.870 --> 03:58.439
Is that why
you married him?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.974
No. I married him
because he was funny.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.043
That's all. He made me laugh.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.414
But I took notice because
he was breathtakingly ugly.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.450
That's why Sam
just looks... strange.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.586
(Max speaking indistinctly)
(laughter)

04:12.620 --> 04:14.622
(laughing)

04:14.655 --> 04:16.524
Hi, Max.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.026
Hi, Mom.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.029
Hi, Arturo.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.431
Sam.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.566
Oh, this is my
brother, Pedro.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.634
Hi.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.670
Okay.

04:29.703 --> 04:35.343
Why don't you guys come in
and grab some whatever.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.678
Sorry.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.382
DUKE: So, my sister Max
has a boyfriend,

04:41.415 --> 04:43.384
and he's 35 years old.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.019
And I saw them kissing
in the backyard.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.688
Like, really gross kissing.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.790
And she was sitting on him.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.393
I never kissed
a boy like that.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.595
But I did kiss Owen
last year

04:54.628 --> 04:58.499
at that harvest party thing
at school.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.368
Okay, so your turn, Sorrow.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.802
Truth or dare.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.504
Um...

05:04.538 --> 05:05.673
Dare.

05:05.706 --> 05:09.710
You have to...

05:09.743 --> 05:12.680
put four Monopoly houses
up your vagina.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.448
That's the same

05:14.482 --> 05:15.716
as a hotel.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.385
Okay, or a hotel.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.820
You have to put four
Monopoly houses or a hotel

05:19.853 --> 05:22.756
up your vagina.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.697
What? You said "dare."

05:30.998 --> 05:33.567
TRESSA:
So how are you dealing with it?

05:33.601 --> 05:34.802
What?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.804
Your daughter
is full-on going out

05:36.837 --> 05:39.540
with a man in his 30s.
(laughs)

05:39.573 --> 05:41.409
(clears throat)

05:41.442 --> 05:43.544
Yeah, well,
what can you do?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.779
I can't do anything,
but she's your kid.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.482
If I want to have my daughter
in my house,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.618
I have to have him here.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.020
Is that okay with you?

05:53.053 --> 05:56.824
No, it's really not,
but it's what's going on.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.092
TRESSA: How did he go
from being with Macy

05:59.126 --> 06:00.828
to being with Max?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.430
(sighs)

06:02.463 --> 06:04.765
Thank you. Oh!
I love you so much.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.133
I am so proud
of you.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.135
This was such
a good show!

06:08.168 --> 06:09.870
MACY:
It was such a good show.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.872
I don't know how you did
everything. She directed it.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.574
MAX: Yeah, well,
it's almost easier

06:13.607 --> 06:15.175
to, like, direct
than to be in it.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.911
You were the director?

06:17.945 --> 06:18.912
Yeah.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
SAM:
Think he was into it.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.597
*

06:39.767 --> 06:42.603
(speaking indistinctly)

06:46.874 --> 06:50.644
I like a good musical.
Well, I mean, but
what does that mean?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.913
SUNNY: But wouldn't you love,
like, a trip to New York?

06:52.946 --> 06:54.815
That would be
so much fun.
Sunny.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.819
Hey, Jeff.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.188
Hey, Mark. How's it going?

07:01.221 --> 07:03.223
PHYLLIS:
So...

07:03.256 --> 07:05.158
I thought you two
were married.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.594
Aren't you married?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.696
Uh, uh,

07:08.729 --> 07:11.031
not anymore, Phil.
We, uh...

07:11.064 --> 07:13.166
we got divorced
this year.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.703
Oh. So now
you're with...

07:15.736 --> 07:17.638
Yeah.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.972
PHYLLIS:
And you?

07:19.006 --> 07:20.641
What are you doing?

07:20.674 --> 07:21.809
Me? Nothing.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.143
Oh, well,

07:23.176 --> 07:24.878
at least you didn't
have children.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.079
(laughs)

07:26.113 --> 07:30.751
Um, we have
three kids, actually.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.220
Oh, well, they
must be devastated.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.590
I know Sam's girls were
reeling since she left Xander.

07:36.624 --> 07:40.193
They've never
quite bounced back.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.261
(scoffs)

07:41.294 --> 07:43.030
Ah! I'm gonna get
another one.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.064
Do you want one?

07:47.100 --> 07:51.972
(indistinct chatter)

07:52.005 --> 07:53.741
Mom, do you have

07:53.774 --> 07:54.942
any port?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.143
Port?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.211
Yeah. Arturo wants
some port.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.114
ARTURO: Your food
is delicious, but I won't

08:01.148 --> 08:03.717
quite taste it until I have a
little bit of port on my lips

08:03.751 --> 08:05.586
and a little bit of
hash smoke in my lungs.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.087
Okay. Well,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.557
the booze is in there.
Help yourself.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.159
Don't give any to my daughter.
She's underage.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.228
And please smoke outside.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.964
(chuckling):
Of course.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.666
Wha...?

08:26.039 --> 08:29.042
(indistinct chatter)

08:38.619 --> 08:40.320
I'm not doing it, Duke.
You have to.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.655
I don't want to!

08:41.689 --> 08:42.956
I did mine.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.191
No!
Pepper!

08:44.224 --> 08:46.026
Do it!

08:46.059 --> 08:48.762
Oh, my God. Okay.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.803
(sighs)

09:07.347 --> 09:09.549
(indistinct chatter
and laughter nearby)

09:16.223 --> 09:18.191
(sighs)

09:18.225 --> 09:20.661
Penis!

09:24.798 --> 09:26.266
(laughing):
All right.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.636
(footsteps approaching)

09:28.669 --> 09:31.138
Duke, tone it down
with them.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.706
Hi, Pepper.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.341
(crying)

09:34.374 --> 09:36.309
I didn't do anything.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.346
Okay, well,
now that's your problem.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.348
(Pepper sobs)

09:41.381 --> 09:43.350
(piano music plays)

09:45.385 --> 09:48.856
* I don't know much

09:48.889 --> 09:52.092
* From night till dawn

09:52.125 --> 09:54.895
* But I am sure
(chuckles)

09:56.329 --> 09:58.231
* That you are gone

09:58.265 --> 10:01.068
* And like a monkey on a bough

10:01.101 --> 10:03.671
* I'm hanging on

10:03.704 --> 10:06.740
(clears throat)
* I'm hanging on

10:06.774 --> 10:09.076
*

10:09.109 --> 10:11.411
* I'm hanging on

10:11.444 --> 10:15.983
* Until I know where you are

10:16.016 --> 10:19.820
* I can't move on

10:19.853 --> 10:22.189
* And you might not get
too far *

10:22.222 --> 10:25.158
* With me hanging on.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.194
*

10:29.129 --> 10:30.931
(speaks indistinctly)

10:30.964 --> 10:34.301
(cheering and clapping)

10:34.334 --> 10:37.404
Jason, you're quite good
at that piano.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.840
I suppose it comes natural.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.943
Yeah, I guess so; my dad plays.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.978
You should learn classical
music, you might like it.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.181
Hmm.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.217
(playing classical piano)

11:05.799 --> 11:08.969
It's so nice when
underprivileged children

11:09.002 --> 11:11.171
learn the classics.
Phil,

11:11.204 --> 11:12.372
he lives in Bel Air.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.274
His grandfather
is Harry Belafonte.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.442
Go.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.177
Oh.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.980
Hey!

11:20.013 --> 11:22.682
(singing opera)

11:33.226 --> 11:35.929
(singing continues)

12:00.420 --> 12:03.290
(laughing and applause)

12:03.323 --> 12:06.259
(cheering and whistling)

12:06.293 --> 12:09.496
Grazie, grazie, grazie.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.064
Grazie bella.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.066
WOMAN:
Bravo, bravo.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.808
You've heard of the running
of the bulls in Pamplona?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.509
Oh, sure.
That's where

12:22.542 --> 12:25.112
the bulls run through the town
and people, like, get gored.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.047
Mm-hmm.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.381
Have you done that?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.951
Oh, yeah.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.519
Mm-hmm.

12:32.552 --> 12:36.056
But the real thing,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.291
the truly rare experience

12:38.325 --> 12:41.128
happens the night before.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.362
What's that?

12:42.395 --> 12:44.164
(inhales)

12:44.197 --> 12:46.934
You go into the stables
where the bulls sleep,

12:46.967 --> 12:50.537
and you climb in and you sleep
with the bulls.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.472
Oh, my God.
Mm-hmm.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.274
No, no, no.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.044
It's fine. Falling asleep
with a dangerous animal

12:57.077 --> 12:59.212
by your side, it's...

12:59.246 --> 13:01.581
(sighs)
I want to say it's...

13:01.614 --> 13:04.551
it's exhilarating.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.555
I don't think
I could do that.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.557
Oh, yeah, you could.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.927
You're a lion.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.397
I'm not a lion.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.299
You are.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.838
You are a lion.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.080
PEDRO:
Sam.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.548
(sighs)

13:35.582 --> 13:37.217
Can I ask you a question?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.920
You already did.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.456
Um, I was just wondering...

13:43.490 --> 13:47.494
Are you open?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.829
Am I what?

13:52.199 --> 13:55.368
Well, are you open?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.937
Am I open?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.541
What, according to you,
does that mean?

14:01.574 --> 14:04.945
Well, some people
are closed,

14:04.978 --> 14:07.047
some are open.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.183
Um, the Shah of Iran
might be closed.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.552
Jerry Falwell, closed.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.588
Lady Gaga, Iggy Pop...

14:15.622 --> 14:17.624
open.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.326
Okay.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.994
So?

14:21.028 --> 14:24.664
(inhales)
Are you... open?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.500
I still don't have
enough information

14:27.534 --> 14:29.302
to answer the question.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.503
Also,

14:30.537 --> 14:32.272
this is boring.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.673
(laughing):
Well, what I...

14:33.706 --> 14:36.076
Hold on. What I mean
is that, um...

14:36.109 --> 14:39.279
Well, uh, you see Max

14:39.312 --> 14:43.050
and Arturo,
they... you know?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.052
Right, so...

14:45.085 --> 14:47.955
I thought, maybe...
me and you.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.689
Are you asking me

14:49.722 --> 14:53.360
if I want to have sex
with my teenage daughter's

14:53.393 --> 14:57.097
35-year-old boyfriend's
little brother?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.699
(laughs)
Oh.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.635
We go to the point.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.573
Yes. Let's do that, shall we?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.977
(laughs)
You're asking me

15:10.010 --> 15:13.146
(with Spanish accent):
if I will fool around with you.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.583
Well, I mean...
(sighs)

15:16.616 --> 15:21.088
Fool around is such a (groans)
general vulgarity.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.524
Um, it depends on the specifics.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.459
Okay.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.296
Well... (sighs)

15:29.329 --> 15:32.732
Why don't you give me
some specifics, Pedro?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.202
What are you proposing?

15:35.235 --> 15:37.971
You want me to say specifics.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.308
Yes.
Okay.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.711
I could, um, rub your shoulders
with warm oil.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.613
No. Boring.

15:46.646 --> 15:50.617
Mm. I could, uh, massage
your feet in a bath filled...

15:50.650 --> 15:53.153
(groans)
Nep. Nope.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.322
Okay. How about
if I eat your pussy

15:55.355 --> 15:58.358
while you talk to your mother
on the phone?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.528
There you go.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.063
I like that one.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.735
And then... I would

16:08.768 --> 16:11.238
put my manhood into...

16:11.271 --> 16:12.472
No, you lost me.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.540
No penises,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.408
especially not yours, hmm.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.510
MAX:
Mom.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.179
Can I talk to you?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.617
You want to talk to me?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.286
Oh.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
That's so interesting.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.190
Yeah, Mom, I would
like to talk to you.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.559
Hmm.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.263
Hmm. Excuse me.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.366
Mmm.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.634
All right, then.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.138
Shall we step
into my office?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.349
So, what can
I do for you?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.251
What's going on
with you and Pedro?

16:58.285 --> 16:59.719
Me and Pedro?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.254
Yeah, Mom.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.422
He's all over you.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.790
What's going on?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.592
Well, I don't know, Max.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.194
He's super cute.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.795
I'm seeing what happens.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.797
My God, Mom.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.600
How could you do that?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.702
Well, why not? Everything's
such a big old mess,

17:15.735 --> 17:18.538
so who cares?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.174
He's Arturo's brother, Mom.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.311
Yeah, well, you want to be
all grown-ups, Max.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.379
Right? All of 16,

17:26.413 --> 17:28.715
and you want to be adults
with all the adults.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.383
So, whatever--
you could have

17:30.417 --> 17:32.319
a 36-year-old boyfriend,
and I could have,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.454
like, a 31-year-old boyfriend,

17:34.487 --> 17:37.357
and you're 16, and I'm...

17:37.390 --> 17:39.859
And it's all just fine.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.828
No, that's not what I want.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.330
I...
It's not?

17:43.363 --> 17:45.098
Because you're doing it, Max.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.334
You chose to skip
about a thousand steps...

17:47.367 --> 17:49.569
No, Mom, I don't want that.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.771
It's too much.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.740
Oh, but you can handle it, Max.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.675
Right? You're
a grown-up

17:55.708 --> 17:57.577
who's ready to have a Spanish,

17:57.610 --> 17:59.879
world-traveling,
many-diseased man

17:59.912 --> 18:01.781
in her life...
No, Mom, I don't want that.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.284
It's too much.
I can't handle it.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.590
Mom...

18:10.623 --> 18:13.760
(whispers):
I'm in trouble.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.863
I'm-I'm in over my head.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.432
I feel so stupid.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.635
And I...
I hate saying this to you.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.139
Shit.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.447
I really like...

18:34.481 --> 18:36.149
Arturo.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.686
It was, like...

18:39.719 --> 18:43.590
such a thrill
to be with an older guy.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.359
But I don't want it now.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.262
He's... he's too much for me.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
Mom...

18:51.898 --> 18:55.302
we go to parties
with people in their 40s,

18:55.335 --> 18:57.604
and I'm not
in control of it.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
And, like, I tried

18:59.339 --> 19:02.675
to tell him once...

19:02.709 --> 19:04.911
but, like, he's so...

19:06.679 --> 19:09.148
I can't really tell him.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.688
I don't know what to do, Mom.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.761
(groans)

19:24.564 --> 19:26.366
(exhales):
Ooh...

19:27.867 --> 19:30.237
Go up to your room, okay?

19:31.804 --> 19:33.373
Okay.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.380
(sighs)

19:50.290 --> 19:53.793
(indistinct chatter)

19:53.826 --> 19:55.962
* There's always someone
to pick up your toys *

19:55.995 --> 19:58.898
* Always someone
to put up with your noise *

19:58.931 --> 20:00.833
* At the end of the day...

20:00.867 --> 20:02.235
Hi.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.003
Ooh.
Mm.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.405
So...
Hmm?

20:05.438 --> 20:06.873
I'm good.
Okay.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.977
Can I, uh, have a word
with you two gentlemen

20:11.010 --> 20:13.546
of Verona?
Sure, Sam.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.284
How about we go with "Ms. Fox"?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.952
All right, Ms. Fox.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
Let's go have a chat.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.356
Both of us?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.858
Yeah. Yeah.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.594
(inhales sharply)
Okay.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.397
Come on down.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.265
That red one...

20:32.299 --> 20:33.533
I know.
is so cool.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.734
I know.
It's over there.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.968
I love it.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.906
Mm.
(Sam exhales)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.574
Wait, wait, where's Max?

20:41.608 --> 20:44.744
Oh, uh, she's upstairs
in her bedroom,

20:44.777 --> 20:48.815
probably getting
into her jammies.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.451
(inhales)
I should say good night to her.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.886
I don't think that's necessary.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.988
You don't?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.757
No.
Oh.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.058
I don't.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.394
I think you need to go home.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.363
And you're not gonna
see Max again.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.500
And you're not gonna
call her again.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.936
And you're not gonna text her,
or e-mail,

21:09.969 --> 21:13.406
or Facebook, or Instagram,
or Snapchat,

21:13.440 --> 21:14.741
or WazzApp.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.445
You're gonna stay away
from my daughter.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.079
Sam, this is silly.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.648
Yes.
Yeah.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.850
Yes, it's very silly.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.352
You know, Sammy,

21:25.385 --> 21:27.320
you try to control her,
you're gonna lose.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.789
Yes, I realize that, Arturo.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.491
And I'm sure you do because

21:31.524 --> 21:34.394
I bet you haven't dated
anyone over 17

21:34.427 --> 21:36.996
since you were about 14.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.666
(laughing)

21:39.699 --> 21:40.867
Please shut up.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.834
Sorry.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.570
And I'm not out here

21:43.603 --> 21:46.939
making some pathetic attempt
to control my child,

21:46.973 --> 21:48.908
I'm protecting her.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.110
From me?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.513
Yes, from you.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.416
She doesn't want
to see you anymore.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.487
Um...

22:02.121 --> 22:04.591
Maybe I should hear that
from her.

22:04.624 --> 22:08.628
Uh, maybe you should hear it
from the police.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.533
Kind of the police now.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.972
(speaking Spanish)

22:21.874 --> 22:23.876
Okay.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.479
No.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.515
(softly):
No?

22:29.882 --> 22:32.084
No.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.121
(sighs)
Aw.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.924
(groans)

22:39.626 --> 22:41.528
(speaking indistinctly)

22:41.561 --> 22:44.030
Okay, everyone out.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.932
(muffled):
I love all of you so, so much,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.133
and get out of my house.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.968
You don't have to go home,

22:49.001 --> 22:51.504
but you can't stay here.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.772
Hi.
Hi.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.774
Jason's dad won't be here
for another hour,

22:54.807 --> 22:57.410
so can we clean up
the party mess?

22:57.444 --> 22:58.778
Are you serious right now?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.813
Yeah, we want to.
I got you, Mom.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.749
Jason.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.383
Come here.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.855
My black son, I love you.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.457
I love you, Mom.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.126
That's so nice!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.728
FRANKIE:
Good night, Mom.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.630
My clean-up crew.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.958
Duke,

23:45.992 --> 23:47.927
everybody get ready
for bed, okay?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.962
You guys, party's over.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.197
Okay.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.200
* Daughter

23:54.233 --> 23:55.902
* Daughter, daughter, daughter

23:55.935 --> 23:58.037
* Daughter, daughter,
daughter *

23:58.070 --> 24:00.039
* Daughter, daughter, daughter

24:00.072 --> 24:01.240
* Daughter, daughter

24:01.273 --> 24:03.610
* Daughter

24:03.643 --> 24:05.578
* You better leave
those boys alone *

24:05.612 --> 24:07.113
* Leave those boys alone

24:07.146 --> 24:09.048
* Daughter,
leave those boys alone *

24:09.081 --> 24:11.250
* Daughter

24:11.283 --> 24:13.052
* After school,
come straight home *

24:13.085 --> 24:14.787
* Leave those boys alone

24:14.821 --> 24:16.723
* Daughter,
leave those boys alone *

24:16.756 --> 24:18.257
* Go to the store
