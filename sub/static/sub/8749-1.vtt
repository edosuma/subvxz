WEBVTT

00:05.441 --> 00:08.025
These people were dying.

00:08.026 --> 00:10.721
The house has a personality of its own.

00:10.722 --> 00:12.869
She did some bad things.

00:12.870 --> 00:15.768
There was a being in my bed with me.

00:15.769 --> 00:18.057
She's pissed.

00:18.058 --> 00:22.127
They had a funeral for her
in that front parlor.

00:22.128 --> 00:26.266
Why'd they have to go and ruin everything?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.969
1898 we think is when she...

00:27.970 --> 00:30.036
She went insane.

00:30.037 --> 00:33.457
She's a sociopath, period.

00:34.157 --> 00:37.277
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.875
There's something down there.

00:38.876 --> 00:40.376
I see dead people.

00:40.377 --> 00:42.378
He doesn't want me back there.

00:42.379 --> 00:44.414
I speak to dead people.

00:44.415 --> 00:45.848
She's pissed.

00:45.849 --> 00:47.116
And they speak to me.

00:47.117 --> 00:49.438
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:49.439 --> 00:52.522
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:52.523 --> 00:54.285
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:54.286 --> 00:56.125
- Where?
- There.

00:56.126 --> 00:58.161
I rely on my partner.

00:58.162 --> 00:59.562
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

00:59.563 --> 01:01.467
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:01.468 --> 01:02.870
Did you want to kill him?

01:02.871 --> 01:06.569
And I know every person, every house...
has secrets.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.137
She did die in this house.

01:08.138 --> 01:09.601
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.008
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in his basement?

01:12.009 --> 01:12.856
No.

01:12.857 --> 01:14.277
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.278 --> 01:16.403
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:16.404 --> 01:18.715
Until the very end... not good.

01:18.716 --> 01:21.217
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.218 --> 01:22.318
Will it get worse?

01:22.319 --> 01:23.519
Or time to get out?

01:23.520 --> 01:26.400
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.975 --> 01:49.995
Steve will do all of the research.

01:51.614 --> 01:55.183
He'll look into the history.

01:55.184 --> 01:58.544
He'll interview witnesses.

01:59.111 --> 02:02.391
He'll find out all the facts that he can.

02:02.392 --> 02:05.595
Then later, we come together
to compare our findings

02:05.596 --> 02:10.156
to see if there's any significant results.

02:10.978 --> 02:13.172
I'm about an hour out of
Syracuse, heading to a

02:13.173 --> 02:16.572
small farming town in upstate
New York called Erieville.

02:16.573 --> 02:19.153
Of all places.

02:20.343 --> 02:22.833
And I'm meeting with a man
named Elvis Restaino.

02:22.834 --> 02:26.561
Now Elvis wound up buying
an old barn and farmhouse.

02:26.562 --> 02:29.015
He's trying to maybe turn it
into a bed and breakfast.

02:29.016 --> 02:33.852
The problem is, he's having some strange
and unexplained things going on.

02:33.853 --> 02:39.058
He had an apparition meet him
middle of the night in his home.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.427
So he's having issues and he's wor...
concerned about

02:41.428 --> 02:43.761
if he should spend the money
or the time to renovate

02:43.762 --> 02:47.232
this place if he's gonna
have a problem with it.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.668
So I'm going to meet with him now.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.170
Once I get the details from
him, I can do some research

02:51.171 --> 02:54.891
and find out what's going on.

03:02.052 --> 03:04.271
Matt will go in before me,

03:04.272 --> 03:08.709
and he'll remove any information
that may distract me

03:08.710 --> 03:12.550
from communicating with the dead.

03:13.416 --> 03:16.656
So he cleans the slate.

03:22.923 --> 03:28.823
And then I come in not knowing anything
and do my walk through the location.

03:53.699 --> 03:57.239
She would hurt her children.

04:21.207 --> 04:23.487
All right.

04:34.027 --> 04:35.875
Okay.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.336
This woman...

04:40.079 --> 04:42.599
She's pissed.

04:44.274 --> 04:48.054
She hates me... with a passion.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.912
She's right there.

05:15.645 --> 05:17.075
- Elvis.
- Hey, Steve. How are you?

05:17.076 --> 05:18.432
- How are you?
- Come on in.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.999
Thank you, uh, for coming.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.122
Man, you are in the middle of nowhere.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.092
Elvis is a designer based
out of the West Coast.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.780
He wanted to renovate a farmhouse,

05:27.781 --> 05:32.732
so he bought this one sight
unseen on the Internet.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.368
Okay. So why don't you
tell me what's going on?

05:35.369 --> 05:38.871
I bought this house, 3,000
miles away from where I live.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.040
Now I'm a bit concerned.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.210
The house has a, uh...

05:44.211 --> 05:46.712
A personality of its own.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.273
Okay.

05:48.274 --> 05:50.716
It's a bit of a concern for me.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.715
Because who's gonna want to come
to a bed and breakfast that

05:53.716 --> 05:56.081
has this negative energy to it?

05:56.082 --> 05:59.796
So has anything specifically happened to
you in the house in any part of the house?

05:59.797 --> 06:01.114
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:01.115 --> 06:05.118
The back room, which is the oldest part
of the house, and then my bedroom.

06:05.119 --> 06:11.019
- You want to show me one of those spots?
- Yeah. Let's go right up the stairs.

06:20.479 --> 06:22.809
There's, like, this
dominating woman who knows

06:22.810 --> 06:26.185
how to manipulate how she is perceived.

06:26.186 --> 06:30.626
That's how she gets her messages across.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.394
Entities can control how you perceive them,

06:34.395 --> 06:40.136
so they can present themselves
in any way, shape, or form.

06:40.137 --> 06:44.474
She always wanted, like, red hair, so
she, like, shows herself with red hair,

06:44.475 --> 06:49.095
but really, it's like a dark, mucky brown.

06:49.653 --> 06:52.833
She's young and she...

06:52.913 --> 06:58.733
She's in her nightdress, so she
did die in her nightdress.

07:09.795 --> 07:11.696
Here we go.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.299
Wow. This is beautiful. Okay.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.231
- This is your bedroom?
- This is where I sleep.

07:16.232 --> 07:18.400
Elvis, why don't you
describe to me what you felt

07:18.401 --> 07:21.179
or what you saw here in the bedroom?

07:21.180 --> 07:23.465
I was coming in from night, had some wine.

07:23.466 --> 07:24.953
I was a bit foggy. I was tired.

07:24.954 --> 07:28.653
I was kind of drifting in and out of sleep.

07:28.654 --> 07:31.965
I woke up, and there was this, uh...

07:31.966 --> 07:36.061
Young woman, really heavy hair...
like, I felt the weight of her hair

07:36.062 --> 07:38.680
kind of draped over my chest...

07:38.681 --> 07:41.892
Kind of looming... over me.

07:41.893 --> 07:43.960
Okay. I'm gonna ask the obvious questions.

07:43.961 --> 07:46.382
Did you drink enough that you
think you wouldn't recall it.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.674
- Or was it dreaming?
- No, no. Not at all.

07:48.675 --> 07:50.577
Now I see you got lights
on the headboard here.

07:50.578 --> 07:53.585
Were the lights on so you could see
clearly, or was it pretty dark in here?

07:53.586 --> 07:55.113
No, this was pitch-black in here.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.411
There was, you know,
there's a nice kind of,

07:57.412 --> 07:59.808
uh, country glow from the
stars and the moon here.

07:59.809 --> 08:02.076
Okay, so you had a little bit
of light, a little natural

08:02.077 --> 08:04.270
light, but you didn't have
any artificial light on?

08:04.271 --> 08:06.234
- No.
- Now you're positive this wasn't some

08:06.235 --> 08:08.115
girl that may have came
by that knows you and...

08:08.116 --> 08:09.103
No. Not at all.

08:09.104 --> 08:10.833
Okay. So you thought about all this stuff?

08:10.834 --> 08:15.094
There was a being in my bed with me.

08:24.187 --> 08:28.975
This is the oldest section
of the house, built in 1790.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.150
I was renovating this room,
this section of the house.

08:32.152 --> 08:35.708
Huge project. There was a loft up here.

08:35.710 --> 08:39.635
And there was wood spanning
the distance of the loft...

08:39.635 --> 08:43.196
Beautiful wood that this
table was made from.

08:43.197 --> 08:45.196
This is the size that the planks were?

08:45.197 --> 08:46.885
And you decided to make a table out of it.

08:46.886 --> 08:49.502
Yeah, 14 feet. I was obsessed...

08:49.503 --> 08:51.971
To make a 14-foot dining room table.

08:51.972 --> 08:54.243
What... I don't need a 14-foot table.

08:54.244 --> 08:57.965
So as I'm taking down the walls...

08:57.966 --> 08:59.909
I find...

08:59.910 --> 09:01.993
This picture.

09:01.994 --> 09:03.872
In the wall or on the wall?

09:03.873 --> 09:05.438
In the wall.

09:05.439 --> 09:10.779
And this was between a
wallpaper and the outer wall.

09:12.651 --> 09:18.551
I made this 14-foot table before I
found this picture in the wall.

09:19.236 --> 09:24.190
It happens that everyone in this
photograph could fit around this table.

09:24.191 --> 09:27.507
Well, there's a lot of people in
this photograph, that's for sure.

09:27.508 --> 09:29.976
You're right. This size table
would fit them perfect.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.817
And they're all dressed for Sunday dinner.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.579
Or Thanksgiving or something like that.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.464
So everything that's happening
to you is only in the older part

09:37.465 --> 09:39.668
or whatever's attached to the
older part of the house?

09:39.669 --> 09:42.030
I could hear things...

09:42.031 --> 09:45.482
- Okay.
- Throughout the whole house.

09:45.483 --> 09:49.117
I could sense things
throughout the whole house.

09:49.118 --> 09:52.470
But... just something peripherally...

09:52.471 --> 09:54.846
Moving or walking by me.

09:54.847 --> 09:56.186
So...

09:56.187 --> 09:58.104
I'm concerned.

09:58.105 --> 09:59.421
- Well...
- And that's...

09:59.422 --> 10:03.993
That's why I have you here.
It's just, uh...

10:03.994 --> 10:06.546
It's... it's... it's odd, you know?
It's really odd.

10:06.547 --> 10:08.241
Now did you hear about anybody dying here,

10:08.242 --> 10:10.848
getting killed here, committing
suicide here, anything like that?

10:10.849 --> 10:11.656
No.

10:11.657 --> 10:14.291
Okay, as far as, like, finding
out the background, the facts...

10:14.292 --> 10:17.344
If there was anything
crime-wise or history-wise...

10:17.345 --> 10:19.095
I'm gonna look into all of that.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.979
You know I work with a partner.

10:20.980 --> 10:22.972
This is her... end of it.

10:22.973 --> 10:24.899
- I don't deal with any of this stuff.
- Okay.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.203
Not that I don't believe it
or I disbelieve it, I just...

10:27.204 --> 10:28.725
- That's not my forte.
- Okay.

10:28.726 --> 10:30.945
I'm an investigator. It's what I do.

10:30.946 --> 10:33.406
I don't really know much about that.

10:33.407 --> 10:35.972
I only deal with the facts.

10:35.973 --> 10:40.241
Uh, what's with the dandelion
in the jar over there?

10:40.242 --> 10:44.545
So I made these blocks and
I put letters on them.

10:44.546 --> 10:48.498
And this was my interpretation of a...

10:48.499 --> 10:54.370
A board to communicate with whoever
wanted to communicate with me.

10:54.371 --> 10:56.125
You mean like a Ouija Board?

10:56.126 --> 10:59.242
I don't even want to say what it was like.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.741
I'm just saying, this is an
open line of communication.

11:02.742 --> 11:05.949
So I had these letters and
numbers on these blocks...

11:05.950 --> 11:09.790
And then I had this mason jar...

11:09.791 --> 11:11.831
With...

11:12.089 --> 11:13.922
A dandelion in it.

11:13.923 --> 11:18.013
And I said, if anyone was
gonna communicate with me...

11:18.014 --> 11:20.497
That the petals...

11:20.498 --> 11:23.159
These dried petals of this dandelion...

11:23.160 --> 11:25.735
Would blow off inside that jar.

11:25.736 --> 11:31.636
All right, so this was your attempt
at trying to contact whatever's here?

11:32.610 --> 11:34.677
Yes, yes. I... yes. It's...

11:34.678 --> 11:36.357
So do you have a background in this

11:36.358 --> 11:42.258
or was this something you just... you...
you know, something you just did?

11:43.154 --> 11:44.615
It... it...

11:44.616 --> 11:46.956
Something...

11:47.158 --> 11:49.047
That I was compelled to do.

11:49.048 --> 11:51.161
Okay, but you haven't done this before?

11:51.162 --> 11:51.862
No.

11:51.863 --> 11:55.950
Well, let me ask you this question then...
was this, all this stuff before or after...

11:55.951 --> 11:58.168
The incident in the bedroom?

11:58.169 --> 11:58.965
Before.

11:58.966 --> 12:04.866
So it's possible that whatever you did
here might have brought this out?

12:06.276 --> 12:08.136
Yes.

12:09.050 --> 12:12.350
Man, it's cold in here.

12:19.689 --> 12:22.868
She's standing at the top of the stairs.

12:22.869 --> 12:27.129
And she's very upset we're intruding.

12:27.644 --> 12:30.141
She's very vain.

12:30.142 --> 12:31.788
Very vain.

12:31.789 --> 12:35.269
And she doesn't like this.

12:36.986 --> 12:40.166
How dare you say that.

12:41.744 --> 12:43.546
She's pissed.

12:43.547 --> 12:45.582
She's... mm.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.124
She's a very dignified pissed off, though.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.125
I mean, I must say.

12:53.056 --> 12:56.226
As a physical medium, one
of the things that I can do

12:56.227 --> 12:59.298
is allow the dead person to enter my body.

12:59.299 --> 13:03.679
In that way, they can speak through me.

13:04.980 --> 13:09.960
Oh, why'd they have to
go and ruin everything?

13:10.439 --> 13:13.799
Who... who's saying that?

13:15.437 --> 13:17.688
I don't want to talk to you.

13:17.689 --> 13:19.757
I don't want to talk to you. Why are you...

13:19.758 --> 13:21.359
Why are you making us do this?

13:21.360 --> 13:23.261
I don't want to talk to you.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.722
I'm very unhappy. It's
just not even worth it.

13:25.723 --> 13:30.643
Wasn't worth it then.
It's not worth it now.

13:32.236 --> 13:36.073
A lot of stomach issues.
There was an illness, too.

13:36.074 --> 13:39.477
Every day... every day, pain.

13:39.478 --> 13:42.112
It's not even worth it.
It's not even worth it.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.445
All this. You struggle...
this, this, this...

13:44.446 --> 13:48.046
And it's not even worth it.

13:49.285 --> 13:52.165
She hates it here.

14:19.432 --> 14:21.619
She hates it here.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.354
Keeps running away from me.

14:23.355 --> 14:26.724
- What time period do you get?
- Uh, I'm getting early, early, early...

14:26.725 --> 14:32.185
Whew. I'd go back to, like,
even maybe 1890 to 1910.

14:39.705 --> 14:42.825
The lady is up there.

14:44.901 --> 14:46.864
What is she doing?

14:46.865 --> 14:50.285
She's just glaring at me.

14:51.797 --> 14:55.577
She hates me... with a passion.

14:55.733 --> 14:58.122
- Where is she now?
- She is on the landing.

14:58.123 --> 15:02.683
At the top of the stairs, on the landing.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.080
She's right there.

15:10.915 --> 15:14.763
Clearly this Elvis is an unusual
guy with an unusual story.

15:14.764 --> 15:16.630
So I'm gonna meet with a
neighbor or two to see

15:16.631 --> 15:21.371
if I could find out what they think of him.

15:21.641 --> 15:24.554
Lillian, thanks for sitting down and
meeting with me. I appreciate it.

15:24.555 --> 15:27.018
I told you, I met with Elvis,
your neighbor across the street.

15:27.019 --> 15:28.026
Yes.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.573
Now what do you think of Elvis?

15:29.574 --> 15:32.029
Do you think that he's of
sound mind and everything?

15:32.030 --> 15:34.208
- Do you think...
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

15:34.209 --> 15:37.710
I have no question in my mind.

15:37.711 --> 15:40.441
If he says something's going
on, you would believe him?

15:40.442 --> 15:41.406
Yeah.

15:41.407 --> 15:47.307
Some people can be more attuned to
something like this than other people.

15:47.353 --> 15:50.889
Now Elvis suggested I come over and maybe
speak with you, and, uh, I'll tell you why.

15:50.890 --> 15:54.626
He's having some... unexplained
things happen in his house.

15:54.627 --> 15:56.762
Uh, he thought maybe you
might have some idea

15:56.763 --> 16:00.238
of maybe who lived there or
some history about the house.

16:00.239 --> 16:06.139
Well, I can't very well go back much
before 1934-35, something like that.

16:06.155 --> 16:09.980
The first people I can remember
living in that house...

16:09.981 --> 16:13.233
Was Ernest and Maude Brown.

16:13.234 --> 16:15.072
I can vaguely remember them.

16:15.073 --> 16:18.853
I can remember when Maude died.

16:19.231 --> 16:23.366
And they had a funeral for her
in that front parlor down there.

16:23.367 --> 16:26.180
Did Maude die in the house?

16:26.181 --> 16:28.821
Maude did, yes.

16:33.788 --> 16:38.650
She's right there, and the kids
are right on the banisters,

16:38.651 --> 16:43.532
to the left of her and
hanging on the banisters.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.350
Smaller...

16:45.351 --> 16:47.334
Children.

16:47.335 --> 16:48.969
I'm getting two children.

16:48.970 --> 16:53.506
And they showed me that there were graves.

16:53.507 --> 16:56.349
They're in a circle, which,
for me, for some reason,

16:56.350 --> 16:58.010
I'm thinking relationship here.

16:58.011 --> 17:01.200
That maybe they're brothers and sister?

17:01.201 --> 17:03.713
Because there's, like, a
really tight bond like that...

17:03.714 --> 17:06.598
Like family, like tight.

17:06.598 --> 17:09.034
The kids were trying to tell me something.

17:09.035 --> 17:11.675
They wanted me to bear witness to some

17:11.676 --> 17:15.162
unspeakable horrors that
were inflicted upon them.

17:15.163 --> 17:19.183
The woman who's here, she's so...

17:19.459 --> 17:23.239
On top of them all the time...

17:23.409 --> 17:25.246
Like they're still under her thumb.

17:25.247 --> 17:27.770
They're just still under her thumb.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.751
And...

17:30.519 --> 17:33.879
That's how it should be.

17:37.880 --> 17:42.481
These young children, they actually
were trying to protect me from her.

17:42.482 --> 17:45.602
And, like, giving me advice, like,
"you better be careful about her".

17:45.603 --> 17:48.603
We don't like her".

17:52.291 --> 17:57.211
And I feel like this is
actually their mother.

17:58.075 --> 18:01.015
She did not want...

18:01.608 --> 18:05.537
A family and is very sick mentally...

18:05.538 --> 18:08.358
Very mentally ill.

18:12.003 --> 18:15.567
Like, she doesn't have emotions really.

18:15.568 --> 18:17.871
There's no empathy there. There's no love.

18:17.872 --> 18:20.789
There's no... there's nothing.

18:20.790 --> 18:25.683
Sometimes entities have remorse
for the things that they've done.

18:25.684 --> 18:27.663
But not this lady.

18:27.664 --> 18:33.202
She did some really nasty things
to them, very nasty things.

18:33.203 --> 18:34.606
What happened to them?

18:34.607 --> 18:36.906
What happened to them? Oh, that's...

18:36.907 --> 18:40.267
Kind of a touchy subject.

18:40.656 --> 18:43.416
She's pure evil.

18:44.486 --> 18:47.906
She's a sociopath, period.

19:14.478 --> 19:16.805
She's a sociopath, period.

19:16.806 --> 19:19.324
There's no empathy there. There's no love.

19:19.325 --> 19:23.045
There's no... there's nothing.

19:24.937 --> 19:26.821
She is completely insane.

19:26.822 --> 19:28.155
And she loves...

19:28.156 --> 19:30.624
She loves her...

19:30.625 --> 19:32.425
Mm.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.294
I think that this lady...

19:36.295 --> 19:40.495
Might have killed someone, like her...

19:47.909 --> 19:50.849
I think that she...

19:50.959 --> 19:54.859
Did some bad things to her kids.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.997
Since Amy and I don't speak during
the course of an investigation,

19:58.998 --> 20:00.966
I have no idea what she may have found out.

20:00.967 --> 20:05.208
So I'm gonna head over to the office of
County records and see what I can find.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.706
I need to find out if anybody
else died in Elvis' home.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.699
And whether or not there was ever a
murder or other violent crime there.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.630
As it turns out, it's a
pretty quiet old farm town.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.725
Matter of fact, all the previous
homeowners died of natural causes.

20:18.726 --> 20:21.321
But the problem is, the records
only go back a hundred years.

20:21.322 --> 20:23.225
So I'm gonna find somebody
at the County clerk's

20:23.226 --> 20:25.931
office that could help me
look a little bit deeper.

20:25.932 --> 20:29.235
I'm doing research on a
location in Erieville.

20:29.236 --> 20:31.039
It's an old farmhouse,
and I'm trying to get

20:31.040 --> 20:33.753
as much background
information on it as I can.

20:33.754 --> 20:37.360
Now I have an address and I
have names of people that...

20:37.361 --> 20:40.572
I think may have resided in the location.

20:40.573 --> 20:45.771
I need any kind of unusual, uh,
occurrence there... deaths...

20:45.772 --> 20:48.932
I don't know, newspaper articles, anything
that could come up to that address.

20:48.933 --> 20:49.736
Okay.

20:49.737 --> 20:51.439
If you could help me out, I appreciate it.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.200
- Okay.
- Thanks.

20:55.370 --> 20:57.875
Can you describe the... the relationship,

20:57.876 --> 21:02.976
with this family and this
woman abusing the kids?

21:06.064 --> 21:10.535
She kept it mostly focused on her
immediate people around her,

21:10.536 --> 21:14.556
doing little horrid things to them.

21:15.952 --> 21:18.319
How can you say I don't
care about my children?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.811
How... how dare you.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.992
How dare you say that.

21:25.684 --> 21:30.693
I think she would've been, like, some
kind of poisoning serial killer.

21:30.694 --> 21:36.394
Like those women who, like,
poison everyone and kill them.

21:37.228 --> 21:39.547
Prior to 1900...

21:39.548 --> 21:41.595
Around the turn of the
century, there was a wife

21:41.596 --> 21:45.992
who poisoned her whole
family in that household.

21:45.993 --> 21:48.178
And they were the Purdys.

21:48.179 --> 21:49.773
And how far back's that go?

21:49.774 --> 21:51.881
This is about 1898.

21:51.882 --> 21:54.514
Okay. Now this is a newspaper
article on the poisoning?

21:54.515 --> 21:56.995
"Forced Paris Green"...

21:56.996 --> 22:00.416
"Down her babies' throats".

22:01.010 --> 22:03.242
"She acted queerly.

22:03.243 --> 22:05.335
A sorrowful home".

22:05.336 --> 22:07.280
What's Paris Green? You know what that is?

22:07.281 --> 22:09.015
It's a poison.

22:09.016 --> 22:11.638
- And how far back's this go? To...
- This is 1875.

22:11.639 --> 22:15.030
All right, so we know that at least
the Purdys lived there from 1875 on.

22:15.031 --> 22:15.891
Correct.

22:15.892 --> 22:19.050
And 1898, we think, is when she decided
she was gonna kill the whole family.

22:19.051 --> 22:21.711
- She went insane, yep.
- Okay.

22:21.712 --> 22:24.298
Well, this is a home run.
At least I got something.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.600
- Can I keep these copies?
- Not a problem.

22:26.601 --> 22:30.921
Excellent. I appreciate that. Thank you.

22:36.836 --> 22:39.296
This woman...

22:39.840 --> 22:43.400
Did something bad to her kid.

22:43.401 --> 22:47.543
Sometimes I'll take on the symptoms,
of whatever physical violence,

22:47.544 --> 22:49.919
the spirit fell victim to.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.337
Lower head pain.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.986
Upper neck pain.

22:53.987 --> 22:56.818
Right here. Very, very, very intense.

22:56.819 --> 22:59.770
Very, very, very bad.

22:59.771 --> 23:03.611
I can literally feel their pain.

23:06.594 --> 23:10.157
I'm having, like, the neck
thing, but at the same time,

23:10.158 --> 23:14.538
it does feel like my head is exploding.

23:18.470 --> 23:24.370
It's weird, because I'm getting ill...
like, double illnesses.

23:24.897 --> 23:28.247
And then something with the
chin down to the chest.

23:28.248 --> 23:31.608
Something with the throat.

23:36.664 --> 23:40.340
Always, always, always, sick.
Sick, sick, sick.

23:40.341 --> 23:43.761
Nobody's happy about this.

23:44.706 --> 23:49.626
They were dying. Like,
these people were dying.

24:14.682 --> 24:16.024
They were dying.

24:16.025 --> 24:19.265
These people were dying.

24:22.122 --> 24:25.185
And this, like, intense head-neck pain...

24:25.186 --> 24:27.119
It's, like, oh, my God.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.787
It's like, I just want to get out.

24:28.788 --> 24:33.768
It's like, it hurts really,
really, really bad.

24:38.272 --> 24:40.075
I don't know much about poisonings.

24:40.076 --> 24:42.758
So I reach out to an expert
that can help me understand

24:42.759 --> 24:45.856
how this lady tried to
kill her entire family...

24:45.857 --> 24:49.665
Using a poison called Paris Green.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.801
Dr. Sawyer, thanks for meeting me.

24:51.802 --> 24:54.335
I'm in the middle of doing
a background investigation

24:54.336 --> 24:58.625
on a case where a woman poisoned her
three children and her husband.

24:58.626 --> 25:00.996
Using something called Paris Green.

25:00.997 --> 25:05.715
Paris Green historically was
used as an arsenical pesticide.

25:05.716 --> 25:10.333
That is an arsenic-containing
pesticide of high potency.

25:10.334 --> 25:15.299
Very dangerous compound, it's been
removed from the market for decades now.

25:15.300 --> 25:20.643
Now the kids, according to the article,
she looks like she force-ingested them.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.790
So I guess, maybe in her state of mind,

25:22.791 --> 25:25.715
she didn't get as much in the
children as she possibly wanted to.

25:25.716 --> 25:27.725
But what would be the long-term effects on

25:27.726 --> 25:30.251
these kids from being
exposed to this stuff?

25:30.252 --> 25:32.412
Multiple.

25:38.623 --> 25:40.776
Sometimes spirits won't talk to me

25:40.777 --> 25:43.961
because they feel threatened,
but not this little boy.

25:43.962 --> 25:45.463
He's just shy.

25:45.464 --> 25:50.984
It's like he's embarrassed
about what happened to him.

25:53.003 --> 25:55.449
The boy's not really talking that much

25:55.450 --> 25:57.966
because there's something with
him with, like, how he...

25:57.967 --> 26:00.640
Like a speech impediment.

26:00.641 --> 26:04.181
I don't know if he can really
communicate very well, this guy,

26:04.182 --> 26:07.084
if that's why he's holding back.

26:07.085 --> 26:11.288
He's so quiet. He's a very, very
quiet, very, very quiet guy.

26:11.289 --> 26:13.149
Shh.

26:19.697 --> 26:24.437
From here, what direction
do you get pulled?

26:26.315 --> 26:28.835
By the trees.

26:29.052 --> 26:32.592
Because it's peaceful there.

26:33.439 --> 26:35.413
Will they talk to you?

26:35.414 --> 26:37.274
Yep.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.986
How much they freaking hate this house.

26:41.987 --> 26:45.527
It makes me s... like, ugh.

26:47.958 --> 26:51.095
Well, you gotta figure, this lady's
murder plot was totally premeditated.

26:51.096 --> 26:56.996
I mean, you don't go out and try to
poison your whole family on a whim.

26:58.202 --> 27:02.306
So, doctor, can you explain to me
the effects of arsenic on the body?

27:02.307 --> 27:06.043
It causes, initially, four primary G.I.
effects...

27:06.044 --> 27:10.214
Vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal cramps, nausea.

27:10.215 --> 27:13.115
At the same time, it
causes pooling of fluids,

27:13.116 --> 27:16.320
causing swelling in the
neck, cerebral swelling.

27:16.321 --> 27:18.122
We call that cerebral edema.

27:18.123 --> 27:21.123
That triggers behavioral
changes and dementia.

27:21.124 --> 27:25.596
Certainly, uh, speech or
other motor functions, uh...

27:25.597 --> 27:30.295
Certainly have the potential
of being impaired.

27:30.296 --> 27:32.536
There's something with him,
with, like, how he s...

27:32.537 --> 27:35.792
Like a speech impediment.

27:35.793 --> 27:38.976
The article's mentioning that
she had a personality change.

27:38.977 --> 27:41.912
Would that be a symptom, like,
uh, her being delusional?

27:41.913 --> 27:45.464
Yes. A person, about seven or ten
days into arsenic poisoning,

27:45.465 --> 27:49.186
can explode into a very
deep, severe level of pain.

27:49.187 --> 27:52.999
And if you combine that
with personality change,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.918
dementia, and even hallucinations.

27:55.919 --> 28:01.819
Certainly a person could appear
at that point to, uh, be insane.

28:07.905 --> 28:10.274
Her children are still scared of her.

28:10.275 --> 28:16.175
Their particular hell is that their
mother still has them under her thumb.

28:26.817 --> 28:30.957
I feel like more over to the right.

28:42.394 --> 28:46.414
So it's more, like, in this area.

28:48.627 --> 28:52.783
They love to just lean up against
the trees and just sit there.

28:52.784 --> 28:58.364
And that's where they're
happiest is out of the house.

29:01.926 --> 29:07.826
These kids, they hate the house,
because the house has... the witch.

29:13.304 --> 29:16.540
The girl and the boy showed me a portal.

29:16.541 --> 29:20.645
It's basically a doorway for the dead.

29:20.646 --> 29:25.134
And this is where I saw the
graves all in a circle.

29:25.135 --> 29:29.019
And that's where the passageway is?

29:29.020 --> 29:33.940
This is the graves and
this is the passageway.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.263
Passageways...

29:39.264 --> 29:44.346
Are basically doorways to
and from other doorways.

29:44.347 --> 29:47.204
The dead can come and
go freely through them.

29:47.205 --> 29:49.540
Someone opened that passageway.

29:49.541 --> 29:53.544
Did they do that, like, while in the
house, or did they go to this location?

29:53.545 --> 29:56.125
I don't know.

29:56.535 --> 29:59.099
I know somebody who lived in that house...

29:59.100 --> 30:02.186
Recently has abilities.

30:02.187 --> 30:05.791
Someone opened that passageway, which is...

30:05.792 --> 30:09.932
Gonna make things a whole lot worse.

30:38.214 --> 30:41.452
All I know is what I
experienced in this house.

30:41.453 --> 30:44.287
Now I get to find out the facts.

30:44.288 --> 30:50.188
This will be the first time I hear Steve's
findings since we started this case.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.605
- Elvis, it's good to see you again.
- Nice seeing you, too.

31:00.606 --> 31:03.375
I wanted to introduce you to Amy,
my partner, Amy, this is Elvis.

31:03.376 --> 31:05.027
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

31:05.028 --> 31:07.494
He had an experience
upstairs in your bedroom,

31:07.495 --> 31:09.496
and I want you to explain that to Amy.

31:09.497 --> 31:12.432
So that she can maybe better
understand what's going on here.

31:12.433 --> 31:16.306
And then I'll explain later
other things that I found out.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.267
- Yeah.
- Okay, so...

31:18.268 --> 31:22.376
I came home. I was out,
just eating, drinking.

31:22.377 --> 31:23.489
Mm-hmm.

31:23.490 --> 31:26.542
I went to sleep, and this, um...

31:26.543 --> 31:28.703
Person...

31:28.830 --> 31:30.312
A young woman...

31:30.313 --> 31:31.313
Mm-hmm.

31:31.314 --> 31:32.832
Appeared.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.483
She's young.

31:34.484 --> 31:38.720
You know, maybe in her mid
20s, mid to late 20s.

31:38.721 --> 31:42.714
Her hair kind of... draped over my body.

31:42.715 --> 31:43.531
Mm-hmm.

31:43.532 --> 31:46.396
And her hair was extremely heavy.

31:46.397 --> 31:48.919
Like, it wasn't...

31:48.920 --> 31:50.438
- Blonde.
- Mm-hmm.

31:50.439 --> 31:53.490
It wasn't black. It was
this, you know, kind of...

31:53.491 --> 31:57.396
A neutral, almost like watching
a black-and-white movie.

31:57.397 --> 31:59.726
She always wanted, like, red hair.

31:59.727 --> 32:01.839
So she, like, shows herself with red hair,

32:01.840 --> 32:05.568
but really, it's like a dark, mucky brown.

32:05.569 --> 32:10.253
Well, uh, I have to say that
I did encounter a woman.

32:10.254 --> 32:15.720
If I had to classify her, I would
classify her as a sociopath.

32:15.721 --> 32:18.027
There's no empathy there. There's no love.

32:18.028 --> 32:20.029
There's no... there's nothing.

32:20.030 --> 32:24.468
Oh, why'd they have to
go and ruin everything?

32:24.469 --> 32:29.629
She may have poisoned her
husband or her children.

32:30.831 --> 32:33.534
What Amy just said gave me chills.

32:33.535 --> 32:39.199
I don't really get frazzled too often,
and this, this frazzled me a lot.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.566
Because you hit the nail on the
head so much with this one.

32:41.567 --> 32:45.555
There was a woman that lived here with
her husband and 3 children back in 1898.

32:45.556 --> 32:49.342
- What time period do you get?
- Uh, I'm getting early, early, early...

32:49.343 --> 32:54.803
Whew. I'd go back to, like,
even maybe 1890 to 1910.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.534
I did some of the records.

32:57.535 --> 33:00.649
The name of the family was Purdy.

33:00.650 --> 33:04.550
And what happened was, a woman...

33:05.009 --> 33:07.889
An insane mother...

33:08.045 --> 33:11.063
Poisoned her husband...

33:11.064 --> 33:14.050
- Oh, my.
- Her three children...

33:14.051 --> 33:17.051
And poisoned herself.

33:19.956 --> 33:24.876
And I feel like this is
actually their mother.

33:24.954 --> 33:30.400
I think she would've been, like, some
kind of poisoning serial killer.

33:30.401 --> 33:35.111
Like those women who, like,
poison everyone and kill them.

33:35.112 --> 33:39.912
She is very sick mentally,
very mentally ill.

33:41.322 --> 33:45.060
She acted like she was insane...

33:45.061 --> 33:48.948
Prior to her attempting to kill the kids.

33:48.949 --> 33:52.475
There was an arsenic poison that
they used called Paris Green.

33:52.476 --> 33:55.048
I didn't know anything about
this Paris Green, so I talk...

33:55.049 --> 33:57.760
Spoke with a toxicologist... a Dr. Sawyer.

33:57.761 --> 34:00.582
Apparently she must have
been ingesting some of this,

34:00.583 --> 34:03.365
a couple of weeks prior to doing
this to her entire family.

34:03.366 --> 34:07.360
Because some of the symptoms from doing
this is, they get a little mental.

34:07.361 --> 34:09.527
Exactly what it says right here.

34:09.527 --> 34:11.422
"Insane mother". She acted insane.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.228
And that's a side effect of this arsenic...

34:13.230 --> 34:16.853
Well, and she was mentally ill before
she started ingesting the poison.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.580
I think that she was probably,

34:19.581 --> 34:23.851
taking it to build up to
what she was going to do.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.914
It was probably a premeditated event.

34:26.915 --> 34:32.554
Including her taking it before
the big day, so to speak.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.565
Nobody's gonna know exactly
what, 100%, happened.

34:36.567 --> 34:38.446
- Right.
- Uh, but we do know that...

34:38.447 --> 34:41.513
The way the doctor
described what happens to

34:41.514 --> 34:44.373
people that are ingesting this over time.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.436
Within a couple of weeks, people
perceive them as being crazy.

34:47.437 --> 34:49.377
They hallucinate, all kinds of...

34:49.378 --> 34:51.431
Your head swelling, the
brain swelling, you know.

34:51.431 --> 34:54.252
Their head swells?

34:54.985 --> 34:58.419
I do get a lot of lower head pain...

34:58.420 --> 34:59.983
Upper neck pain.

34:59.984 --> 35:02.785
Right here. Very, very, very intense.

35:02.786 --> 35:05.117
Very, very, very bad.

35:05.118 --> 35:08.120
And this, like, intense head-neck pain...

35:08.121 --> 35:10.055
It's like, oh, my God.

35:10.056 --> 35:12.303
I'm having, like, the neck thing,

35:12.304 --> 35:17.235
but at the same time, it does
feel like my head is exploding.

35:17.236 --> 35:20.032
What might have started out as
her trying to kill herself...

35:20.033 --> 35:23.035
Eventually turned into a
homicide-suicide attempt.

35:23.036 --> 35:25.786
She wound up dying in this house.

35:25.787 --> 35:28.456
She didn't measure out... the way
the doctor explained it to me...

35:28.457 --> 35:31.092
Nobody could measure out how
much is gonna be lethal.

35:31.093 --> 35:32.534
And how much won't be lethal.

35:32.535 --> 35:35.659
She put this arsenic in
the husband's coffee.

35:35.660 --> 35:39.801
She forcibly fed it to a 4 year old, a
2 year old, and she had a 4 month old.

35:39.802 --> 35:44.539
I think she did some bad
things to her kids.

35:44.540 --> 35:47.042
3, 4, 5... about that age.

35:47.043 --> 35:51.679
There's also something with,
like, smaller... children.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.451
The 4 month old eventually
died nine months after.

35:56.452 --> 35:59.067
It was ironic what happened she
tried to kill her whole family

35:59.068 --> 36:01.455
and then winded up being the
only one that died well...

36:01.456 --> 36:03.158
The younger child died later on.

36:03.159 --> 36:05.583
But what she tried to do didn't succeed.

36:05.584 --> 36:09.184
She wound up killing herself.

36:09.457 --> 36:12.295
I think that this lady...

36:12.296 --> 36:14.876
Killed someone.

36:16.066 --> 36:19.606
It makes me s... like, ugh.

36:19.789 --> 36:22.112
It's almost like a food poisoning
would be, the symptoms,

36:22.113 --> 36:24.186
the way the doctor described
it to me, the vomiting,

36:24.187 --> 36:26.247
the throwing up, the bloody diarrhea.

36:26.248 --> 36:28.216
Very, very painful death.

36:28.217 --> 36:30.834
The kids suffered for
years, apparently from,

36:30.835 --> 36:34.306
effects of all this arsenic
being in their system.

36:34.307 --> 36:38.350
Always, always, always sick.
Sick, sick, sick.

36:38.351 --> 36:43.451
It's weird, because I'm
getting double illnesses.

36:43.957 --> 36:47.142
And then something with the
chin down to the chest.

36:47.143 --> 36:50.503
Something with the throat.

36:50.854 --> 36:54.066
She hit it verbatim as far
as what actually happened.

36:54.067 --> 36:59.518
Do you think the person that may
have visited him is this woman?

36:59.519 --> 37:03.515
I think it's a possibility because
she does have long dark thick hair.

37:03.516 --> 37:07.893
I feel that she has been
here for a long time.

37:07.894 --> 37:12.097
Um, but there is a location that was...

37:12.098 --> 37:15.628
Inadvertently opened,
and what I call them is

37:15.629 --> 37:18.907
a passageway, or a doorway, or a vortex.

37:18.908 --> 37:24.188
And it seems to have come about
because someone maybe was doing,

37:24.189 --> 37:28.675
you know, a little bit of,
uh, ghost hunting, or...

37:28.676 --> 37:34.556
Seance, or something of that nature.
That kind of opened it.

37:36.091 --> 37:38.431
It's okay.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.880
Uh... whew.

38:07.217 --> 38:10.763
There is a location that was...

38:10.764 --> 38:14.133
Inadvertently opened,
and what I call them is

38:14.134 --> 38:16.928
a passageway, or a doorway, or a vortex.

38:16.929 --> 38:19.146
What could have caused that to happen?

38:19.147 --> 38:22.599
Typically, when something
like that takes place.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.800
Um, someone like a ghost hunter or...

38:26.803 --> 38:29.865
Someone who was playing around
with ouijas, or tarots...

38:29.866 --> 38:33.766
- Or seances...
- Like out there?

38:34.772 --> 38:39.226
And this is where I saw the
graves all in a circle.

38:39.227 --> 38:42.978
And that's where the passageway is?

38:42.979 --> 38:47.899
This is the graves and
this is the passageway.

38:48.957 --> 38:50.710
Now I'm just gonna put it on the table.

38:50.711 --> 38:53.041
He explained to me during,

38:53.042 --> 38:56.068
my interview with him that he was in
this very room at this very table

38:56.069 --> 38:59.675
with a couple of friends of his and he
performed, what, we'll just say a ritual...

38:59.676 --> 39:03.173
- Oh.
- To try to contact whoever might be here.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.968
- Oh.
- I mean, this dandelion thing...

39:04.969 --> 39:07.610
That was a way that he was gonna use...

39:07.611 --> 39:09.782
To find out if somebody was here.

39:09.783 --> 39:11.490
Plus, some of the blocks in this box here.

39:11.491 --> 39:14.011
Oh. Okay. Oh.

39:14.075 --> 39:15.550
Now the other thing he did tell me,

39:15.551 --> 39:20.139
was that none of this stuff really
happened till you did this ceremony.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.798
So I just want to find out
if that's what you think

39:22.799 --> 39:24.634
might have opened this portal.

39:24.635 --> 39:30.535
Right. Yeah. That's exactly the type
of thing that I'm talking about.

39:31.285 --> 39:34.086
I know somebody who lived in that house...

39:34.087 --> 39:36.837
Recently has abilities.

39:36.838 --> 39:40.720
Someone opened that passageway, which is...

39:40.721 --> 39:44.861
Gonna make things a whole lot worse.

39:45.986 --> 39:49.784
It's really best not to
create these types of things.

39:49.785 --> 39:52.453
What can happen is that the dead...

39:52.454 --> 39:55.714
Or beings can pass in and out of it.

39:55.715 --> 39:57.934
Um, it's a doorway.

39:57.935 --> 40:02.915
For things that we don't
necessarily comprehend.

40:05.113 --> 40:10.818
So I do want you to understand what
you may have gotten yourself into.

40:10.819 --> 40:13.060
I wanted to...

40:13.061 --> 40:17.011
Make it clear that this energy in the
house, I was available for them.

40:17.012 --> 40:22.912
Well, when you did that, you opened
up a passageway, or a doorway.

40:23.355 --> 40:27.057
Which will bring, potentially, other...

40:27.058 --> 40:30.459
Entities and things to deal with.

40:30.460 --> 40:33.778
And I did want to talk about the woman.

40:33.779 --> 40:37.681
I don't know if she came through
the passageway or... or what,

40:37.682 --> 40:40.934
but I feel like she's been
here for a very long time.

40:40.935 --> 40:44.773
But having the passageway here now.

40:44.774 --> 40:48.240
Will make it so that she has
more of an interaction.

40:48.241 --> 40:52.561
With you and, potentially, other people.

40:53.477 --> 40:56.099
And that's why I'm saying, you
need to kind of get rid of it.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.961
I have to give that some thought.

40:57.962 --> 41:01.195
By keeping it open, things
are gonna come through,

41:01.196 --> 41:07.096
and it may be people or entities
that are not very pleasant.

41:07.245 --> 41:10.545
They know where you are.

41:11.611 --> 41:14.960
Anything and everything
knows where you are.

41:14.961 --> 41:18.955
You're kind of like a beacon now.

41:18.956 --> 41:22.074
So when you make yourself
available to the dead,

41:22.075 --> 41:26.564
there is a responsibility
to yourself and to them.

41:26.565 --> 41:29.733
And there are boundaries to be set.

41:29.734 --> 41:34.544
Well, I... I... I've taken
responsibility for this.

41:34.545 --> 41:35.795
Right, yes.

41:35.796 --> 41:37.517
And I'm just aware of, um...

41:37.518 --> 41:39.789
Things will definitely get worse, though.

41:39.790 --> 41:42.080
- I mean, you know that.
- Right. No. Okay.

41:42.081 --> 41:44.202
I... I realize that. I just...

41:44.203 --> 41:45.950
Right.

41:45.951 --> 41:48.411
I understand.

41:48.919 --> 41:52.622
Elvis has no idea what
he's gotten himself into.

41:52.623 --> 41:54.472
He thinks he can handle it.

41:54.473 --> 41:56.869
And there's nothing I can do to help him,

41:56.870 --> 42:00.805
until something scares him so
badly that he asks for my help.

42:00.806 --> 42:04.416
That's when I'll hear back from Elvis.

42:04.417 --> 42:08.955
That's when I always hear
back from people like Elvis.
