01:37.722 --> 01:38.723
Hey, Jang-SUP!

01:38.723 --> 01:41.934
Chief MA's here! I told you to
hurry just in case he came!

01:42.101 --> 01:43.311
And this time,
it's the real deal...

01:43.311 --> 01:44.812
- What's this?
- Hey!

01:44.937 --> 01:46.230
This one is sure.
So pay up first

01:46.230 --> 01:47.356
Shit, money first!

01:47.356 --> 01:48.357
Now!

01:50.568 --> 01:52.737
That social worker
discovered the body,

01:52.987 --> 01:55.948
And JEONG Myung-sook
has no family or friends

01:56.198 --> 01:57.575
Hey, hurry and wrap things up!

01:57.575 --> 01:59.118
Hey, Chief, how's it going?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.621
Hey, This is my jurisdiction

02:02.580 --> 02:05.875
What a die-hard. He's scouring
every JEONG Myung-sook

02:06.626 --> 02:07.960
Jeez

02:22.558 --> 02:23.559
Here

02:23.893 --> 02:26.771
It seems she's been dead
for almost a month

02:27.021 --> 02:29.690
BASIC LIVING SECURITY RECIPIENT
: JEONG MYUNG-SOOK

02:29.690 --> 02:33.944
No sign of trespassing,
suicide pills or food

02:34.695 --> 02:38.699
The only one that keep in touch
with her was the social worker,

02:39.325 --> 02:43.079
She stated JEONG never
interacted with neighbors...

02:44.455 --> 02:47.208
Seems like the old lady
lived and died lonely

02:51.462 --> 02:53.214
I guess it's her this time

02:53.547 --> 02:55.174
That JEONG Myung-sook

03:00.846 --> 03:02.223
Hey, Miss BAEK!

03:03.557 --> 03:04.558
Miss BAEK!

03:05.351 --> 03:07.978
Finish this up, will you?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.888
You wanna mess your hands up?

03:42.888 --> 03:44.348
Just for a few more bucks?

03:47.768 --> 03:49.895
- Give it to me.
- You should have gloves on

03:51.021 --> 03:52.898
Hey, I got it!

04:02.241 --> 04:04.243
Shit, I can almost see
your panties

04:09.665 --> 04:12.418
Here, put it on

04:14.295 --> 04:15.296
What for?

04:15.921 --> 04:18.339
With those rags, you'll freeze
to death

04:19.007 --> 04:22.219
I always wanted to shred that
shit-colored jacket

04:22.511 --> 04:24.847
I've been waiting for
the right moment, but I won't

04:25.765 --> 04:27.349
It doesn't look cool

04:27.516 --> 04:29.643
Fuck cool for crying out loud...

04:32.396 --> 04:34.774
It's badly paid, and
it's frigid winter

04:34.774 --> 04:36.525
Stop that car wash job

04:37.026 --> 04:38.778
before you freeze to death

04:43.532 --> 04:45.743
Considering all those jobs
you have,

04:45.743 --> 04:47.912
I can't believe you won't
get yourself anything decent

04:48.913 --> 04:52.041
Whatcha gonna do with all that
cash? Use it as fucking wallpaper?

04:57.630 --> 04:58.923
Hey, Mr. smartass

05:01.300 --> 05:02.551
What the fuck?

05:02.676 --> 05:03.677
What?

05:05.262 --> 05:06.931
Your eyes tell me something's
cooking

05:14.146 --> 05:17.191
Your mother was found
dead this morning

05:18.025 --> 05:21.070
The exact cause of death
was not known yet

05:21.695 --> 05:23.572
We need to do an autopsy,

05:24.073 --> 05:26.283
but for now it looks like
she died of lung cancer

05:34.416 --> 05:36.293
She's been dead for a while

05:41.298 --> 05:42.842
Should we cremate her?

05:45.177 --> 05:47.179
Well you're her guardian, right?

05:51.475 --> 05:52.726
Guardian...

05:54.103 --> 05:55.229
I...

05:56.480 --> 05:59.483
just wanted to see
how she died

06:00.317 --> 06:01.610
That's why I'm here

06:03.070 --> 06:04.321
Do as you please

06:46.655 --> 06:48.908
YOOSUNG EEL STEW

06:55.539 --> 06:56.916
Jeez...

07:00.169 --> 07:01.795
You need to get a new car

07:01.795 --> 07:03.297
to catch the bad guys...

07:05.799 --> 07:10.763
Mum, you refused me a college
education I desperately wanted

07:10.763 --> 07:14.683
Then made me stay home
and wash his stupid diapers

07:15.684 --> 07:17.937
I hope you're satisfied
from up there!

07:17.937 --> 07:21.941
That I'm a single old maid
dealing with this kinda shit

07:24.276 --> 07:26.070
She was married once

07:27.321 --> 07:29.073
Hey, it didn't last long

07:30.324 --> 07:31.575
Shut up, twerP---

07:31.575 --> 07:32.576
Goddamn it!

07:33.077 --> 07:35.037
What's up with your hand?

07:35.579 --> 07:37.456
Did you arrest a criminal again?

07:39.083 --> 07:41.335
My brother is detective

07:41.460 --> 07:42.461
Shut up...

07:42.461 --> 07:44.296
Great detective of violent crimes section

07:46.465 --> 07:47.800
Hey, Jang-SUP

07:48.926 --> 07:52.596
Are you still looking after
that girl?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.559
You just never listen to me

07:58.477 --> 08:02.481
I may be sick of washing your
filthy undies, but how dare she!

08:02.481 --> 08:04.692
You're the only family I've got,
you know?!

08:04.692 --> 08:06.485
A girl with no class or

08:06.485 --> 08:09.571
- foundation...
- Who says I'm marrying her?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.699
She has no intention of
marrying me

08:11.865 --> 08:12.992
How come?

08:13.492 --> 08:14.827
She doesn't want you?

08:15.494 --> 08:16.704
Forget it

08:17.579 --> 08:19.498
She must be kidding,
for god's sake...

08:19.498 --> 08:21.750
Doesn't she know you're
a detective?

08:21.750 --> 08:24.003
Not everyone can be one,

08:24.503 --> 08:29.508
with a sexy face like yours,
and 6 feet tall

08:29.508 --> 08:31.135
- She doesn't deserve you
- Shit

08:31.218 --> 08:34.804
She doesn't have a clue
How dare she...

08:35.054 --> 08:36.557
It tastes like shit

08:37.265 --> 08:39.018
I can't believe this sells

08:39.268 --> 08:41.645
- Are you coming?
- Spit it out if you think it's shit!

08:41.812 --> 08:44.523
This round,
I bring something big!

08:46.692 --> 08:49.570
JEONG Myung-sook had a criminal record?

08:50.070 --> 08:54.324
The old lady was suspicious, anyway...

08:54.700 --> 08:57.202
So, I looked into her information

08:57.411 --> 09:00.789
She spent 6 years in a prison,
and released in 2007

09:01.081 --> 09:03.167
Is it him?
Seochang Construction's boy

09:03.167 --> 09:04.835
Yeah, the asshole...

09:05.044 --> 09:07.588
He was your first suspect, right?

09:08.422 --> 09:11.717
JEONG Myung-sook
hit that asshole by car,

09:11.717 --> 09:15.345
to avenge BAEK Sang-ah's case

09:18.223 --> 09:20.476
You fucking bitch!

09:21.101 --> 09:23.437
Awe, goddamn you

09:23.437 --> 09:25.981
Chief, she's still in high school!

09:26.106 --> 09:29.068
She's clearly a rape victim,
why can't be self-defense?

09:29.068 --> 09:32.362
She's just a punk who lived
at an orphanage,

09:33.322 --> 09:36.492
while his dad is a Seochang
Construction major stockholder,

09:37.493 --> 09:40.704
and his brother-in-law's
a District court judge

09:41.246 --> 09:43.457
You think it'll be possible
to indict him?

09:55.219 --> 09:56.512
Let's go

10:00.140 --> 10:01.391
There she is!

10:02.226 --> 10:03.477
Protect her

10:17.157 --> 10:18.492
Let's get married

10:24.414 --> 10:25.916
I said, let's get married

10:31.296 --> 10:33.298
Goddamn you

10:34.550 --> 10:37.261
I told you it's not in my fate
to be anyone's wife or mom?

10:37.761 --> 10:40.389
Say it twice more and
it'll be the 470th time

10:48.647 --> 10:49.940
Hey, what's that?

10:50.941 --> 10:51.942
Uh?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.069
Are you really leaving for
Jeju Island?

10:54.278 --> 10:55.696
Without discussing it
with me?

10:56.572 --> 10:57.781
I'm asking you!

10:59.158 --> 11:00.409
What am I to you?

11:00.409 --> 11:02.452
Don't I mean anything to you?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.831
Jang-SLIP

11:06.957 --> 11:09.585
The more you get involved,
the worse your life will get

11:10.836 --> 11:12.713
I don't deserve married life

11:13.422 --> 11:15.966
So just go find a girl
good for you

11:18.969 --> 11:20.721
What am I supposed to do?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.431
What should I do more?

11:22.431 --> 11:23.724
Why don't you stop?!

11:24.474 --> 11:26.727
I feel suffocated by the look
you give me

11:26.727 --> 11:30.063
That pathetic, apologetic
face you send at me

11:31.356 --> 11:33.066
For the rest of my life?

11:35.485 --> 11:37.988
And didn't I tell you not to
look for that woman?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.699
What were you expecting?

11:41.241 --> 11:44.745
Shit, I'm sorry that I did,
goddamn it!

11:45.746 --> 11:47.331
I'm fucking sorry!

11:51.376 --> 11:55.380
You might be a fucking bitch,
but I thought you would forgive her

11:55.380 --> 11:57.841
seeing your mom
died that miserably

11:57.841 --> 12:00.344
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know?!

12:02.721 --> 12:04.348
That woman

12:04.348 --> 12:07.267
would drink herself sick
and beat me like crazy

12:07.267 --> 12:09.519
And even that wasn't enough
so she abandoned me

12:09.519 --> 12:11.104
That goddamn memory!

12:11.104 --> 12:15.859
That held me back and messed up
my life. You were there to see it!

12:15.901 --> 12:17.486
What, forgive her?

12:23.033 --> 12:24.368
This is it

12:25.535 --> 12:27.537
Stop butting into my life

12:29.373 --> 12:30.624
I beg you

12:40.008 --> 12:41.677
Damn it...

13:40.736 --> 13:45.866
MISS BAEK

13:56.251 --> 14:00.464
She should have been starving...

14:01.381 --> 14:03.216
Don't look at them

14:30.285 --> 14:31.995
I'm sorry...

14:33.121 --> 14:34.373
Ma'am...

14:35.999 --> 14:37.501
Don't call me that

14:39.669 --> 14:40.921
Missus...

14:42.005 --> 14:43.006
Hey!

14:44.925 --> 14:47.427
Stop being an ass-kisser
and finish your meal

14:55.811 --> 14:57.187
Miss BAEK

14:59.815 --> 15:01.817
That's what you call me

15:06.405 --> 15:09.074
For fuck's sake, what am I doing?

15:09.950 --> 15:10.909
I'm...

15:10.909 --> 15:12.911
KIM Ji-eun

15:16.706 --> 15:18.291
Nine...years old

15:24.214 --> 15:25.590
By the way,

15:26.091 --> 15:28.677
how come you're barely
covered every time I see you?

15:29.719 --> 15:31.430
What about your mom
and dad...?

15:31.721 --> 15:35.058
My dad... he's the only one at home

15:39.479 --> 15:41.231
Did your dad do that to you?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.611
Whatever

15:46.611 --> 15:48.321
What do I care? Shit...

15:52.200 --> 15:53.201
Jbeun

15:54.369 --> 15:56.329
Why are you here at this hour?

15:57.956 --> 15:58.707
Sis...

15:58.707 --> 15:59.875
Hi there

16:00.625 --> 16:02.711
I was passing by

16:03.128 --> 16:05.255
and I was sure it was her

16:06.131 --> 16:07.257
She's yours?

16:07.757 --> 16:10.260
Well, not quite

16:13.221 --> 16:17.017
She's got weak and
should watch what she eats

16:18.143 --> 16:22.272
But now she comes out and
acts like she's starving

16:23.148 --> 16:24.774
Sorry for this, sis

16:24.774 --> 16:26.526
I'll pay for it

16:28.028 --> 16:30.655
KIM Ji-eun? Give her back
her clothes

16:32.240 --> 16:33.617
KIM Ji-eun?

17:41.184 --> 17:47.315
Let us pray. In hopes of being
filled with the Holy Spirit

17:49.526 --> 17:54.072
Oh Lord..Let us pray
Oh Lord..

17:55.782 --> 17:57.701
WELFARE DISCONTINUATION NOTICE
Look here!

17:58.285 --> 18:01.329
Her dad's an alcoholic
going through rehab

18:01.454 --> 18:03.582
If you just cut off
child support,

18:04.457 --> 18:06.835
then how are we to raise
the kid?

18:13.091 --> 18:15.343
No, you don't need to know
who I am

18:23.226 --> 18:25.437
Hey, get it there

18:25.437 --> 18:28.481
Men are scared off if
women jump at them first

18:28.607 --> 18:29.608
Then what should we do?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.235
A good push and pull will
do the job

18:32.235 --> 18:35.196
Hey, J00! What brings you
here at this hour?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.371
Sis...

18:44.956 --> 18:46.625
She's not my kid

18:47.959 --> 18:49.502
It's none of my business

18:51.630 --> 18:53.632
It's nothing like that

18:54.007 --> 18:57.010
I just don't want you to
get the wrong idea

18:57.886 --> 18:59.346
Actually,

19:00.096 --> 19:03.350
My boyfriend had her with
his ex when he was 2O

19:04.351 --> 19:07.395
I just took her under my wing

19:09.481 --> 19:12.776
I didn't even know he had a kid

19:13.026 --> 19:15.987
I thought he would wake up
and get a job, right?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.740
But when this kept on for years

19:19.115 --> 19:22.410
I couldn't take it anymore and
thought of leaving, but...

19:23.536 --> 19:27.666
we just physically grew on
each other

19:28.917 --> 19:33.296
Sometimes you feel like
leaving your own kid

19:33.922 --> 19:36.424
So how do you think
it feels

19:37.550 --> 19:39.803
raising someone else's kid,

19:41.930 --> 19:43.306
right?

20:08.456 --> 20:09.833
Hey!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.085
Joy!

20:14.295 --> 20:16.089
Did you eat, huh?

20:16.089 --> 20:17.716
How've you been?

20:20.343 --> 20:23.304
This is why a dog's better
than a human being

20:26.975 --> 20:27.976
KIM II-gon

20:28.476 --> 20:30.937
The state cut off your kid's
child support

20:34.065 --> 20:36.109
I can't believe
I'm still in this shithole

21:01.634 --> 21:02.886
Whatcha lookin at?

21:05.096 --> 21:06.890
I said, whatcha lookin at?!

21:07.265 --> 21:08.391
What...

21:08.641 --> 21:09.768
You think I'm easy?

21:10.393 --> 21:11.394
HEY

21:11.394 --> 21:13.980
Tell me, you think I'm easy!

21:35.919 --> 21:37.921
Your face disgusts me

22:35.937 --> 22:37.981
How do you do?

22:38.189 --> 22:40.191
Come in, please...

22:40.608 --> 22:43.736
You must be shaken up after being
questioned at the Nambu Precinct.

22:43.736 --> 22:45.989
Sorry to bother you again
on the phone...

22:46.197 --> 22:47.365
It's okay

22:47.699 --> 22:50.201
But to be the first
to find her

22:50.994 --> 22:52.453
It's tough

22:52.996 --> 22:57.250
It was hard that her last image
lingered on for days

22:57.458 --> 23:01.713
And I keep remembering
the things she used to tell me

23:02.463 --> 23:08.887
When Mrs Jeong lose her husband
and suffered from severe depression,

23:10.471 --> 23:14.642
she would beat her daughter
whenever she got drunk

23:14.642 --> 23:19.105
So... she blamed herself
for ruined her daughter's life

23:19.105 --> 23:21.107
She suffered a lot

23:32.660 --> 23:35.538
DEATH CERTIFICATE

23:36.164 --> 23:38.041
<i>You're her guardian...</i>

24:56.202 --> 24:57.495
She beats you?

24:59.956 --> 25:03.626
Tell me. J00 Mi-gyeong
did this things to you?!

25:06.254 --> 25:07.505
No-I-

25:36.534 --> 25:38.786
That chicken, there!
This, that and that

25:52.300 --> 25:53.926
Awe...

25:55.011 --> 25:56.554
What the hell am I doing?

26:06.814 --> 26:08.441
Just finish it

26:15.573 --> 26:17.450
Where were you planning to go?

26:20.411 --> 26:22.205
I was just hungry

26:24.582 --> 26:28.169
They don't seem to feed you,
but give you money?

26:30.296 --> 26:31.839
After they beat me,

26:32.423 --> 26:34.425
they give me money

26:40.848 --> 26:42.934
Does anyone know about this?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.486
Get up

26:53.820 --> 26:56.114
PRECINCT STATION

27:03.496 --> 27:04.247
Why?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.334
They, the police...

27:10.711 --> 27:12.880
They send me back home...

27:24.142 --> 27:27.145
Ma'am, you need to slow down
on the disciplining

27:27.645 --> 27:30.106
Make sure this doesn't
happen again

27:30.148 --> 27:31.357
I'm sorry

27:53.546 --> 27:55.006
Hey, KIM II-gon

27:55.298 --> 27:57.175
Don't you know I am going through

27:57.175 --> 27:59.927
all kinds of troubles
to feed the fucking girl?

28:00.303 --> 28:01.554
Hey!

28:10.271 --> 28:11.397
Damn it...

28:15.776 --> 28:17.195
Miss BAEK, is it done?

28:17.653 --> 28:19.697
Look, it's still dirty

28:20.198 --> 28:23.576
Here and there...
Stains are not erased

28:25.661 --> 28:26.829
Jeez...

28:28.039 --> 28:29.457
Oh, Okay

28:29.582 --> 28:33.961
Sorry, my dear.
It's my fault

28:45.056 --> 28:46.182
By the way,

28:47.099 --> 28:48.976
is there anywhere else
you can go?

28:54.190 --> 28:55.858
What was I thinking, goddamn it...

28:56.359 --> 28:58.236
- Goddamn it
- Hey!

29:05.743 --> 29:07.495
I wasn't cursing at you

29:09.705 --> 29:10.957
I was cursing myself

29:12.500 --> 29:13.960
Miss BAEK

29:15.628 --> 29:17.964
Do you hate yourself?

29:30.518 --> 29:32.103
If you don't have a place to go...

29:32.103 --> 29:34.105
Is there anywhere you want to go?

she said is heaven

32:12.179 --> 32:14.306
Miss BAEK, where's your mom?

32:23.816 --> 32:25.317
She's in hell, my mom

32:26.277 --> 32:27.319
Hell...

32:38.581 --> 32:40.040
<i>Run from me</i>

32:41.834 --> 32:43.085
<i>as far as you can</i>

32:54.972 --> 32:56.599
Get up. Let's go home

33:33.886 --> 33:36.013
Didn't I tell you not to
wander around?

33:37.264 --> 33:38.641
Come on in!

33:39.767 --> 33:41.519
What the fuck are you doing?

33:43.896 --> 33:45.356
What are you doing?

33:51.278 --> 33:54.782
That's a good boy!

34:06.043 --> 34:07.044
Sis...

34:08.379 --> 34:10.089
What the fuck are you doing?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.341
You...

34:13.425 --> 34:16.679
- If you lay a finger on her...
- What do you mean?

34:16.971 --> 34:18.097
Who me?

34:19.223 --> 34:20.975
Is that what you told her?

34:24.478 --> 34:25.603
Don't

34:27.106 --> 34:28.232
Get off me

34:28.857 --> 34:33.112
Who are you to interfere
with my life?

34:33.112 --> 34:37.449
You're nothing but
a measly masseuse!

34:37.866 --> 34:39.827
If you're not up to
the responsibility,

34:39.827 --> 34:42.121
stop meddling in my business

34:47.960 --> 34:50.504
I'm sure you've never
even raised a dog

34:51.005 --> 34:53.591
If you really want to have her,
how about $100 grand?

34:54.132 --> 34:56.010
Then take her at the price of
$100 grand

34:56.510 --> 34:57.761
You fucking bitch!

35:06.520 --> 35:07.521
KIM Ji-eun

35:08.355 --> 35:10.649
Didn't I tell you to stop
biting your nails?

35:12.359 --> 35:15.654
She has a habit of
biting her nails

35:18.907 --> 35:21.118
And how did this wound happen?

35:27.499 --> 35:29.043
I fell down

35:29.293 --> 35:30.419
By myself...

35:36.550 --> 35:37.676
Stay here

35:40.012 --> 35:44.808
The next door lady said she
never heard a child crying...

35:45.059 --> 35:48.395
Since it's winter vacation,
we can't ask her school

35:48.395 --> 35:50.189
But I told you I'm a witness!

35:50.189 --> 35:53.150
It'll be a headache
if anything goes wrong

35:53.942 --> 35:56.028
We have no concrete
proof for now

35:57.446 --> 36:02.201
I know the law, but it's hard to
pass any judgements right now

36:02.451 --> 36:04.953
Come on, even the kid is
denying everything

36:05.579 --> 36:07.831
Don't make this a big deal

36:07.956 --> 36:12.711
What about her taking
our kid without our consent?

36:12.711 --> 36:14.838
Also causing disturbance
at our home?

36:15.047 --> 36:17.299
Shouldn't you include
housebreaking

36:19.093 --> 36:22.346
and assault as well as
personal attack?

36:22.930 --> 36:23.931
By the way,

36:23.931 --> 36:25.724
what's your relationship
to the child?

36:26.100 --> 36:28.686
Can you show me any
identification?

36:29.228 --> 36:32.439
If you don't have any on you,
write your ID number here

36:44.243 --> 36:46.495
BAEK SANG-AH

36:54.461 --> 36:55.629
Chief

36:55.879 --> 36:57.131
Look...

37:01.009 --> 37:02.261
Uh,

37:02.970 --> 37:04.263
BAEK Sang-ah

37:05.514 --> 37:06.598
Miss

37:13.605 --> 37:15.607
You have a criminal record in '99

37:15.858 --> 37:16.900
What is it?

37:18.902 --> 37:19.987
Are you okay?

37:21.905 --> 37:24.116
I'm with the Joongbu Precinct
What is it?

37:26.368 --> 37:29.538
How could they beat
such a small child?

37:34.042 --> 37:36.920
The Children's Crisis Center
told me they'll visit her soon,

37:37.254 --> 37:38.630
so let's see how things go

38:03.405 --> 38:05.407
I found the kid!

38:07.576 --> 38:09.453
- Where is the kid?
- Over there, sir

38:09.912 --> 38:12.164
It's been 4 days, since he is buried

38:12.331 --> 38:15.292
The Kid's father and father's girlfriend
confessed to the murder

38:26.094 --> 38:31.600
Hundreds of thousands of children
are abused in this small country,

38:31.600 --> 38:37.481
while a number of centers are
this small, it fuckin' makes sense?

38:37.940 --> 38:40.108
<i>Excuse me?</i>

38:43.070 --> 38:46.240
<i>They don't have a slot for her
at the center</i>

38:46.240 --> 38:49.117
<i>and they promised
to visit her regularly...</i>

38:49.117 --> 38:50.118
Right

38:50.619 --> 38:52.871
For someone's who's never
owned a dog...

38:55.624 --> 38:57.584
I must've been possessed

38:59.336 --> 39:01.129
I shouldn't have interfered

39:08.846 --> 39:10.347
The kid's fine

39:13.141 --> 39:14.518
Day after tomorrow?

39:18.146 --> 39:20.274
Okay, please come

39:27.614 --> 39:28.782
KIM II-gon

39:29.283 --> 39:32.035
The center people are visiting,
so keep an eye on her

39:35.664 --> 39:37.666
Until they leave, don't touch her,
okay?

39:38.041 --> 39:40.252
It'll be a headache if they find
a new bruise

39:41.879 --> 39:45.799
Are you feeling sick?
Let's get you into warm clothes

39:48.302 --> 39:49.428
Ooh, it's cold

40:03.692 --> 40:04.651
Shit!

40:13.160 --> 40:14.286
Miss BAEK...

40:14.328 --> 40:15.579
Miss BAEK

40:15.954 --> 40:16.914
Hey,

40:17.080 --> 40:18.165
BAEKY!

40:22.169 --> 40:25.297
I can't believe you're spacing
out in front of cash?

40:25.589 --> 40:26.548
Here!

40:26.798 --> 40:28.800
I threw in your severance pay
as well

40:29.843 --> 40:33.096
It'll be hard to find another
employee like you, Baeky

40:33.430 --> 40:34.973
But you've got Jang-mi

40:35.724 --> 40:36.433
Who, me?

40:36.433 --> 40:39.227
What about me? What?

40:40.187 --> 40:42.105
I knew something smelled fishy

40:42.564 --> 40:45.484
Are you moving in together
with Jang-sup? Huh?

40:45.484 --> 40:48.487
If not, then are you pregnant?

40:49.738 --> 40:50.948
I'm late

40:51.073 --> 40:54.743
Joy's here. You had to
get away from daddy

40:54.743 --> 40:57.746
I thought he became calm,
but I guess not

40:57.871 --> 41:01.208
<i>KIM U-gon goes batshit crazy
when he's drunk</i>

41:02.125 --> 41:03.835
and it drives me crazy

41:04.753 --> 41:07.881
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Thanks for looking after him

41:09.132 --> 41:10.592
- See ya
- Okay

41:12.511 --> 41:13.845
What happened?

41:14.137 --> 41:16.139
Something happen
between you two?

41:42.040 --> 41:43.375
Don't drink it

41:51.133 --> 41:52.926
It'll only keep you alive

42:12.654 --> 42:13.822
Stop it.

42:13.905 --> 42:15.198
Dad...dy...

42:15.824 --> 42:17.451
Forgive me...

42:17.576 --> 42:19.828
It irritates me...
That sniveling...

42:23.331 --> 42:26.084
I said, stop, Goddamn it!

42:26.835 --> 42:27.711
HEY

42:27.961 --> 42:30.088
What's the use of living
like this?

42:30.547 --> 42:31.590
Just...

42:31.840 --> 42:33.425
Just fucking die...

42:35.469 --> 42:36.928
That'll be better, right?

42:37.846 --> 42:39.097
For us both, right?

42:39.222 --> 42:40.557
Awe, shit...

42:40.807 --> 42:43.435
I told her no!
Why the fuck were you born?!

42:44.603 --> 42:47.230
I wish you were dead...

42:49.483 --> 42:51.860
I'm sorry for being born...

Stop the car

45:55.418 --> 45:56.253
Why!

Something's wrong, isn't there?

52:21.429 --> 52:23.431
How should I know?
Huh?

52:24.057 --> 52:28.061
A woman was calling the girl,
pressing the doorbell like crazy!

52:28.186 --> 52:29.520
When was that?

52:29.520 --> 52:30.688

53:07.600 --> 53:08.726
KIM II-gon

53:09.811 --> 53:11.813
Didn't you understand
what I said?

53:14.857 --> 53:19.696
If we're caught again,
we're both fucked

53:19.696 --> 53:24.325
So I told you to keep an eye on her,
you fucking moron!

53:48.391 --> 53:49.642
Excuse me, boss

53:55.356 --> 53:58.401
You know who lives
in JOHYUN villa?

53:58.401 --> 54:03.406
Did you see someone visited at #204?

54:04.657 --> 54:06.367
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

54:08.870 --> 54:09.746
God...

54:09.746 --> 54:11.998
Awe, for crying out loud...

54:14.417 --> 54:15.793
Rewind it again

55:38.626 --> 55:39.627
Look

55:41.254 --> 55:42.630
We are same

56:25.047 --> 56:26.132
I'm...

56:26.424 --> 56:27.800
not educated enough

56:29.051 --> 56:30.928
to teach you anything

56:33.890 --> 56:35.641
And I've got nothing...

56:37.018 --> 56:38.394
to give you

56:40.271 --> 56:41.272
But

56:42.815 --> 56:44.442
I'll stay by your side

56:51.198 --> 56:52.450
I'll protect you

57:06.964 --> 57:09.675
I'll protect you too

57:32.490 --> 57:33.824
Excuse me,

57:34.867 --> 57:36.744
but in the ER tonight,

57:36.744 --> 57:39.246
was there a kid this big and...

57:48.089 --> 57:50.591
JUNG-ANG HOSPITAL

58:02.019 --> 58:04.146
BAEK SANG-AH

58:10.152 --> 58:12.029
BAEK SANG-AH

58:22.289 --> 58:24.000
What is it that you want?

58:25.167 --> 58:26.794
Do you want to raise her?

58:29.380 --> 58:30.756
<i>8 years ago,</i>

58:32.758 --> 58:34.301
<i>in my mailbox</i>

58:35.302 --> 58:38.180
I found an envelope with
a savings account book

58:40.683 --> 58:42.184
I felt so embarrassed

58:44.061 --> 58:48.149
My house entrance she passed
through was narrow and filthy

58:49.775 --> 58:51.444
The mailbox she stuck

58:54.655 --> 58:56.949
the envelope in
was covered in rust

59:02.788 --> 59:04.540
Its miserable state
was so embarrassing

59:06.959 --> 59:08.085
<i>So</i>

59:11.464 --> 59:12.840
Your mother

59:14.175 --> 59:16.719
let you go to save you

59:43.746 --> 59:45.998
<i>She said that day,</i>

59:47.124 --> 59:50.461
<i>was a day she never forgot</i>

59:51.879 --> 59:56.008
<i>I guess it haunted her
until the day she died</i>

01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:22.910
Doctor! Doctor!

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.787
Help...

01:00:25.162 --> 01:00:28.165
Help, please help

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:32.169
Please help

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.691
Arrest me

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.193
Ma'am, what's the matter?

01:00:56.193 --> 01:00:58.154
- Arrest me
- Excuse me? Madam...

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.572
Arrest me

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:03.701
Don't let me near my kid, please

01:01:04.201 --> 01:01:06.662
- Arrest me, please
- What happened?

01:01:06.787 --> 01:01:08.789
Let go, let me go!

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:11.584
- Let go! Arrest me!
- Ma'am, snap out of it!

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:15.337
Don't let me near my kid!

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.729
LOST CHILDREN SHELTER

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.023
Run from me

01:02:17.983 --> 01:02:19.360
As far as you can

01:02:20.402 --> 01:02:22.029
I'll take your picture!

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:17.835
<i>Mom...</i>

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.591
<i>Can a person like me...</i>

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:27.553
<i>Is it okay for me</i>

01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:30.180
<i>to be a mom?</i>

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:05.966
HOW MANY YEARS SENTENCED
FOR CHILD ABUSE

01:04:13.098 --> 01:04:14.141
Damn you...

01:04:18.645 --> 01:04:20.105
Hey, KIM II-gon...

01:04:20.981 --> 01:04:22.274
Did you know?

01:04:22.524 --> 01:04:24.902
I thought she'd be
better off dead...

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:27.905
The cover up would be
a drag, but

01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:30.532
I thought it would make you
come around

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:35.245
A kid, I could always give birth
to one...

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.126
Anyway, listen carefully

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:44.171
If you don't want us to rot
away in prison,

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:48.634
we have to move first before
center people come

01:04:58.018 --> 01:04:59.812
Why's he acting weird?

01:05:03.941 --> 01:05:04.900
Er!!!

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:08.570
Didn't you say that woman

01:05:09.446 --> 01:05:11.448
had a criminal record?

01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:12.574
Huh?

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:13.826
I mean

01:05:14.535 --> 01:05:17.788
my girlfriend went on
a business trip to countryside,

01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:22.084
I never told her cause
she will worry about it

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:26.672
My child goes missing

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:31.593
Why you have been
bothering me since last night?!

01:05:31.593 --> 01:05:33.178
I can't work for crying out loud!

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:37.349
You said a cop dropped by to
check the CCTV footage, right?

01:05:37.724 --> 01:05:40.853
The cop took it with him!

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.855
What was on it?

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.857
For heaven's sake,

01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:47.609
The masseuse girl

01:05:48.485 --> 01:05:52.239
slipped into the alley holding
the kid and disappeared that way

01:05:52.489 --> 01:05:54.867
The kid seemed hurt bad
since she wasn't moving

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.703
<i>You know, she had a criminal record</i>

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:02.749
<i>Once it's found that she took the kid,
file a report</i>

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:06.753
<i>That she's been kidnapped</i>

01:06:25.772 --> 01:06:28.108
This happened here before

01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:30.527
with a lady going crazy over
finding the kid

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:32.279
- Yeah?
- Yes...

01:06:33.238 --> 01:06:36.783
But it doesn't look like a place
where a kid's been living

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:39.620
How does your daughter
spend her time playing?

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:44.416
Well, she's always home, so...

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.501
Ah...

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.252
How tall is she?

01:06:47.544 --> 01:06:48.879
Her height...

01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:53.425
About this tall?

01:06:54.134 --> 01:06:56.386
What was she wearing
when she disappeared?

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.308
I'm...

01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:02.809
I'm not sure

01:07:11.276 --> 01:07:14.905
Did you do a background check on her?

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:16.949
What?

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:18.283
Attempted murder?

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:22.204
The woman who came to ER...

01:07:24.414 --> 01:07:25.791
Is this her?

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:28.293
I found her!
The time's around 22:36.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.048
<i>Hey, BAEK Sang-ah!
Pick up the phone</i>

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:36.593
<i>You'll be arrested,
if you run away with her</i>

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.220
<i>I going there right now,
so sit and wait</i>

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.597
<i>BOARDING TICKET
I going there right now,
so sit and wait</i>

01:08:35.484 --> 01:08:36.569
What's going on?

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.991
Sorry, but breakfast's not ready yet

01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:43.577
Oh my, there's a child
I'm so sorry

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:44.995
Yes, see you again

01:08:57.506 --> 01:08:58.966
Now it's all fine

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:04.973
I'll go to your place to look
for evidence,

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:08.268
so promise to explain well
to the cops, okay?

01:09:09.227 --> 01:09:10.228
Fine

01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:13.273
- What should I do...
- Get her some food

01:09:13.273 --> 01:09:14.649
And stop making a fuss

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.109
I guess she needs to eat

01:09:16.526 --> 01:09:19.029
Have you ever tried
eel stew before?

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.282
Should I fry eel? Jang-sup!

01:09:24.408 --> 01:09:27.371
Yeah, you need to find
a way to be happy together

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.504
Her father's filed charges
for kidnapping

01:09:36.129 --> 01:09:39.131
So we need a proof that
she's been beaten

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.551
I'll take care of it

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.055
So don't go anywhere,
just stay right here, okay?

01:09:46.139 --> 01:09:48.058
Where's your cell phone?

01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:52.938
Turn yours off

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.775
and have mine

01:09:59.277 --> 01:10:01.446
So let's see what we can do

01:10:11.915 --> 01:10:15.544
<i>Since she's recognized as
an abused child</i>

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:18.338
<i>once she enters the
Children's Crisis Center,</i>

01:10:18.338 --> 01:10:21.466
<i>they won't easily hand her over
to an ex-convict</i>

01:10:21.466 --> 01:10:22.718
Yes, that's the situation...

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.219
<i>What's this about?</i>

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.220
Nothing

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.221
I see

01:10:26.596 --> 01:10:27.973
Okay, thank you

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:28.849
Okay

01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:32.602
Hey, heY!

01:10:32.936 --> 01:10:34.312
You son of a bitch

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:36.606
What, kidnapped?

01:10:36.606 --> 01:10:39.735
- Jang-sup! What's going on?
- Where the hell is she?

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.361
You son of a bitch

01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:43.989
Drop the charges, now!

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:47.117
Or else you and that bitch
will regret you're alive

01:10:47.617 --> 01:10:48.577
Huh?!

01:10:49.953 --> 01:10:52.831
What's all the commotion?
Is there a fight?

01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:55.709
The child on the 2nd floor
has disappeared

01:10:55.876 --> 01:10:57.085
The 2nd floor?

01:10:57.627 --> 01:11:00.338
You mean the kid hanging
from the window yesterday?

01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:08.138
I drank too much and called
a chauffeur service yesterday

01:11:08.346 --> 01:11:09.389
And...

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:12.267
I saw a kid dangling
from the 2nd floor

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:14.603
I thought I was hallucinating...

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.146
What do you mean
a kid was hanging...

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:17.481
Here, here, rewind!

01:11:17.647 --> 01:11:18.774
- Rewind!
- Keep quiet

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.776
- Rewind, hurry!
- I'm watching it!

01:11:26.406 --> 01:11:27.407
What's this?

01:11:27.407 --> 01:11:29.284
She wasn't kidnapped,
goddamn it!

01:11:29.659 --> 01:11:31.036
- That fucking asshole!
<i>- Police?</i>

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:32.162
We are doomed. Cut it!

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:33.163
Hey, get him!

01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:53.058
KIM IL-GON

01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:07.197
Sis...

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:10.951
Anything wrong?

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:11.701
Shut up!

01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:13.203
Just shut the fuck up!

01:12:16.581 --> 01:12:19.459
I just knew she'd drag me down
one day

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:22.462
From the day I laid eyes
on her, she was bad luck

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:26.675
Without her, KIM Il-gon wouldn't
have become so fucked up

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:31.304
Without her, my life wouldn't
have been so desperate

01:12:41.606 --> 01:12:45.986
If we get rid of her, no need
to worry about evidence, right?

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:51.700
<i>...35-year-old Park was sentenced 7 years for
child abuse resulting in death</i>

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.494
<i>The court found PARK
guilty of all charges,</i>

01:12:54.494 --> 01:12:59.249
<i>he was a first time offender
and expressing deep remorse for his crimes</i>

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.751
Goddamn it, he should've
received the death penalty

01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:04.838
<i>That it was outrageous to apply
death by abuse</i>

01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:06.631
Fuck the court

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:18.143
Fucking unbelievable...

01:13:28.486 --> 01:13:30.614
As horrible as it is,

01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:34.659
nothing can cut family ties
except death

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.920
I guess you really like her

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:50.050
It's not your fault

01:13:50.675 --> 01:13:54.804
If there is one, it's just that
you two aren't related

01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:58.058
Hello

01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:04.439
- Hello
- Welcome

01:14:27.545 --> 01:14:28.838
- Hey, what brings you here?
- Ah, okay!

01:14:28.838 --> 01:14:32.217
- Hey, no! I need to be in there!
- I know!

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:33.593
Uh, hey!

01:14:36.596 --> 01:14:39.057
What a stubborn fuck

01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:42.102
What's with that fucker?
It's not his case

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:43.853
Forget about it

01:14:46.606 --> 01:14:48.984
Hey, where is J00 Mi-gyeong?

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:51.945
Huh?

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:57.242
Do you even know
what your crime is?

01:14:58.994 --> 01:14:59.869
Do you?

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:03.999
You and that bitch

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:07.585
made it a habit of beating her
with coat hangers, broom sticks

01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:12.132
In winter, get her wet and
freeze in the laundry room!

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.259
Uh? Hey, look at me!

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.596
This is what you did to your
own kid! Look hard!

01:15:18.596 --> 01:15:19.389
Hey, Jang-SUP!

01:15:19.389 --> 01:15:20.849
Let him talk

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.018
Go! Just fuckin go!

01:15:25.895 --> 01:15:27.647
Hey, let me ask you this

01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:30.358
Isn't she your own kid?

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.403
Even if it just happened,
isn't she your own kid?!

01:15:33.778 --> 01:15:35.739
Did you really mean to kill her?

01:15:36.781 --> 01:15:38.408
Did you?

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:40.910
She didn't die, did she?

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:44.789
Awe, come on...!

01:15:45.915 --> 01:15:48.043
Let go, get out!

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:51.046
I was beaten as a kid,
but did I end up dead?

01:15:51.504 --> 01:15:54.049
Where were you all
when I needed help?

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.384
So lay off you sons-of-bitches!

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.432
Get out

01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:03.683
Get out, out!

01:16:04.392 --> 01:16:05.435

01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:09.564
You know...

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:14.444
After growing up around
this shit,

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:19.032
her life's gonna
turn out great?

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:25.830
YOO JANG-MI

Jang-sup? But he
already stopped by

01:18:32.957 --> 01:18:34.667
There's something else

I vow I'll never see you again

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.356
<i>Calm down and speak slowly</i>

01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:09.442
You think I can calm down?

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:12.320
<i>- You're running away...

What were you gonna
do with the kid?

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:50.274
Were you really thinking of
killing her?

01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:53.986
You want to take her
under your wing, right?

01:23:56.239 --> 01:24:00.618
Yeah, at first I wished her
dead. But not anymore

01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:04.372
She physically grew on me
as I beat her

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:09.794
If you're thinking of
taking her in, I'm sorry

01:24:10.169 --> 01:24:11.921
I'm not letting her go

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:14.048
I'll keep her for good

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:17.552
You'll see

01:24:20.304 --> 01:24:21.764

01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:03.300
Let go!

01:27:05.302 --> 01:27:06.429
Let me go!

01:27:07.346 --> 01:27:08.848
- BAEK Sang-ah!
- Let go!

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:10.683
Just stop, will you?!

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:17.982
Are you hurt?

01:27:23.696 --> 01:27:24.989
The car's over there

01:27:24.989 --> 01:27:26.073

Here...

01:27:37.126 --> 01:27:38.836
You want her to see you
handcuffed?

01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:48.512
I'm sorry...

01:27:54.393 --> 01:27:55.644
Just go

01:27:55.644 --> 01:27:56.896
and be her mom

01:27:57.021 --> 01:27:58.522
Even if it's just for a few days

01:27:59.899 --> 01:28:01.025
Go, now!

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:09.283
Hurry and go!

01:29:15.224 --> 01:29:16.976

01:29:28.237 --> 01:29:29.822
