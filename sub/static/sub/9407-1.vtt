00:26.459 --> 00:30.088
Death to he
who sets a leprechaun free.

00:30.163 --> 00:34.463
Steal his gold,
it will corrupt your soul, you see.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.630
For many a moon,
the legend has grown.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.472
Death toll increases,
solution unknown.

00:44.911 --> 00:48.642
Beware the evil wanderer,
in search of his loot.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.674
Lest ye suffer the wrath
of his golden flute.

00:54.154 --> 00:57.487
Flee while you can,
the future's not good...

00:57.557 --> 01:02.392
For no one is safe
from a lep in the hood.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.798
This map you bought
was bullshit.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.430
Man, it got to be
down here somewhere.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.167
Do you see any gold, fool?

03:30.643 --> 03:33.441
The burger's probably still good.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.347
The burger's probably good, huh?

03:36.416 --> 03:38.111
What you talking about, man?

03:45.091 --> 03:47.321
What the fuck?

03:47.393 --> 03:50.055
Holy shit!

03:50.129 --> 03:53.257
You midget Midas motherfucker.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.733
Yo, Slug, look at this shit.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.898
Oh, shit.

04:08.681 --> 04:11.206
That's it.
It's all here, baby.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.387
That's all I want, right here.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.560
You collect the rest
of this stuff, man.

04:30.703 --> 04:34.366
Now we're moving on up
to the East Side.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.756
Yeah, that's it.
That's all I needed.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.776
Ah... free at last.
Free at last.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.584
Thank God almighty.
Free at last.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.495
Goddangit.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.919
Come on, come on.
I'll knock you...

06:51.244 --> 06:54.179
Stealing me gold
is a sure way to grow old.

06:57.550 --> 07:02.783
Now me little room
will become your tomb.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.747
Got your ass.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.456
Motown, here I come.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.265
Ain't nothin' in this world
gonna be for free...

07:52.338 --> 07:55.603
Everybody's comin' up,
but not like me.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.576
Somebody's gotta win,
but somebody's gotta lose...

07:58.644 --> 08:01.306
Live your life right,
good choices choose.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.349
Let no one
try and hold me back...

08:04.417 --> 08:07.614
I'm rippin' up the stage,
Butch rippin' up the track.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.121
Postmaster P, that's me,
you see...

08:10.189 --> 08:13.317
The P's for <Positive>,
and that's my guarantee.

08:13.392 --> 08:16.361
I got no time
for negativity...

08:16.429 --> 08:19.330
Smooth is my groove,
and fresh my recipe.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.128
Postmaster P, y'all,
positivity...

08:22.201 --> 08:25.329
A positive flow to your speakers
is what I'm bringin', see.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.464
The crew and me,
we all got unity...

08:28.541 --> 08:31.305
We keep the crowd hyped,
positively.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.311
Oh, shit!

08:42.020 --> 08:44.011
Damn, what the hell happened?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.921
What the fuck y'all did
to the stage?

08:45.992 --> 08:48.517
Too much ammonia?
Not enough nitrogen?

08:48.594 --> 08:51.392
So, whuddup wit' the gig?
We on the bill?

08:51.464 --> 08:54.024
Don't worry about the bill.
You'll get that.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.658
This is our shot out, man.

08:55.735 --> 08:59.136
If we win this contest, we're going
to the Vegas Hip-Hop Cafe.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.763
We're talking video promo,
publishing rights...

09:00.840 --> 09:02.102
record deals. All that shit.

09:02.174 --> 09:05.371
Only record deal you're getting
is with the the L.A.P.D.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.902
If you get your shit right,
I might give you another audition.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.812
Now get the fuck out of here.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.318
Shit, I almost get my ass
blown to bits by a virgin.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.883
Shut up, fool. I should have never
told you I was a virgin.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.053
I know you don't know nothing
about no pussy...

09:23.129 --> 09:25.962
but I thought you knew
about that nitrogen trimesteride.

09:26.032 --> 09:29.866
That's nitrogen tri-iodide, fool!
Tri-iodide.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.564
It's an iodine/ammonia compound.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.731
Fool, you're going to
wind up in a compound.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.570
The hell with it,
we fucked up.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.236
See, Stray, you're thinking
with a spirit of failure.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.371
You really do need to hook up
some Tony Robbins.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.472
That big, white
goofy-lookin' mo'fo'?

09:43.549 --> 09:45.915
Always talking about
<if a tree fall in the bathroom...

09:45.985 --> 09:48.146
take time to stop
and smell the forest>...

09:48.220 --> 09:49.585
That ain't right.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.850
See, our unconscious beliefs
control our behavior.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.621
Only through daily positive,
positive affirmation can we overcome.

09:55.695 --> 09:59.859
Yeah, well,
affirmate this, motherfuckers.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.423
If we don't get
this equipment fixed...

10:02.501 --> 10:04.435
we ain't winning no contest...

10:04.503 --> 10:07.495
we ain't going to no Vegas
and we ain't ever leaving Compton.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.939
The guy said we could
audition again, right?

10:10.009 --> 10:12.068
What'd it take
to get our shit fixed?

10:12.144 --> 10:14.476
This shit?
A whole lot of money.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.572
We're fucked.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.083
We just got to think positive.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.920
Jimi Hendrix.

10:24.991 --> 10:28.893
The real Jimi Hendrix.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.088
Boy, where you get this guitar?

10:31.163 --> 10:32.790
It was my Uncle Junior's.

10:32.865 --> 10:35.197
Yeah, yeah,
he got it from Jimi Hendrix.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.498
Yeah, that's right,
when they used to play together.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.029
Your Uncle Junior
used to play with Jimi?

10:42.108 --> 10:45.339
At Psychedela-Palooza in 1971.

10:45.411 --> 10:49.177
Yeah, that's right.
That's, that's Jimi's guitar.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.910
Psychedela-Palooza?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.745
I never heard of that one before.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.119
So?

10:58.190 --> 11:01.717
Wait a minute. '71?
Didn't Jimi die in 1970?

11:01.794 --> 11:04.991
No, no,
that was Paul McCartney.

11:05.064 --> 11:08.397
So, what'cha give us
for this piece of music history?

11:08.467 --> 11:11.402
I'll give you about five seconds
to get out of my shop.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.200
Come in here bullshitting
with this piece of crap.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.332
Hey, man, ain't nobody
bullshitting you.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.673
<Stray Bullet>...

11:18.744 --> 11:21.372
Boy, you ain't no gangster.

11:21.447 --> 11:26.248
And <Postmaster P>.
What is that shit?

11:26.318 --> 11:28.786
You ain't ever been
in the military.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.847
It's Postmaster P, 'cause I deliver
a positive message, that's all.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.790
Positive message?
- Yeah.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.589
<Punk Ass> is more like it.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.186
And Butch...

11:38.264 --> 11:41.392
Boy, you need to get yourself
some pussy...

11:41.467 --> 11:44.698
before you blow off your dick
fucking with those chemicals.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.136
Now, get up out of my shop.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.140
This ain't no charity.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.941
How much you give us
for it, Chow?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.846
Is this Jimi signature for real?

11:56.916 --> 11:59.544
Yeah, who else you know
signs his name like that?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.951
I look stupid?
Everybody know Jimi die in 1970.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.721
You try bullshit Chow?
Get the fuck out.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.058
Damn, Chow.
Come on, man.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.099
Hey, don't touch.
Don't touch.

12:15.835 --> 12:18.201
You leave Chow's store.
Go on!

12:18.270 --> 12:20.238
Hip and Hop
your black ass home.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.001
Hula, hula, go, go, go.

12:27.613 --> 12:30.411
What are we supposed to do now?
Rob somebody?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.577
No, man,
we ain't robbin' nobody.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.078
There goes Mack Daddy O'Nasses
right there.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.885
Why do they call him
<Onassis>?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.789
He don't look Greek to me.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.760
He was a pimp, man.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.888
Back in the day,
Mack Daddy <owned asses>.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.399
So now he's got his own
little hip-hop thing goin'.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.594
Yeah--gangster hip-hop.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.536
Man, <bitches and ho's>
ain't all my man knows.

13:03.215 --> 13:06.116
If it ain't the <Milli Vanilli>
of Compton rap.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.813
I heard you guys were sampling
chipmunk tracks now.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.625
The machine broke, man,
that ain't no chipmunk track.

13:15.694 --> 13:19.926
Yo, we got some new shit.
It's hot, man. You should hear it.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.092
What's in it for me?

13:23.169 --> 13:26.161
What's in it for you?
- Moolah.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.229
You could be reppin' us, man.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.936
After we win that contest in Vegas,
we gonna be the hottest act around.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.772
Get in.
Better not be wastin' my time.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.582
Oh, shit--!

13:43.656 --> 13:46.352
Uh... we tight...

13:46.425 --> 13:49.292
Uh... that's right.

13:49.361 --> 13:52.387
Uh... we tight...

13:52.464 --> 13:55.228
Postmaster P, y'all,
positivity...

13:55.301 --> 13:58.429
a positive flow to your speakers
is what I'm bringin', see.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.268
The crew and me,
we all got unity.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.366
We keep the crowd hyped,
positively.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.741
Do what you gotta do,
comin' from the hood...>

14:12.952 --> 14:15.477
It's not much,
but it's not the worst.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.421
You guys seem hungry.
I'm sure I can do something with you.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.626
We got to change some things.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.323
Like what?

14:25.397 --> 14:27.865
This bullshit, all right?

14:27.933 --> 14:30.731
I ain't with that
<save the fuckin' hood> bullshit...

14:30.803 --> 14:34.261
<treat your girl right>.
That shit is wack, all right?

14:34.340 --> 14:37.468
This label, we rap about Uzis,
blowing motherfuckers' heads off.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.909
You know what I'm saying?
Smack your bitch up.

14:39.979 --> 14:44.575
Shoot your motherfuckin' homeboy
in the face type of shit.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.642
Yeah, but Mack Daddy,
that's not what we do, man.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.086
We try to send out
a positive message.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.646
Yeah, I mean, really,
the shit is sellin'--

14:55.227 --> 14:56.956
What?

14:59.865 --> 15:01.594
Man, they wanna change everything.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.965
Hey, you wanna be large?
- Yeah.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.004
All right then, you gotta
do what he says.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.539
So you wanna change
everything we did?

15:08.607 --> 15:11.132
Who gives a shit?
If we're large?

15:13.879 --> 15:16.776
Hey you... get the fuck away
from that. Is that yours?

15:16.849 --> 15:18.680
Stop touchin' shit.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.049
Go over there
with your fuckin' friends.

15:22.554 --> 15:25.421
You fuckin' up.
Watch this fuckin' kid.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.323
Hey, you, you listen to me.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.794
You don't wanna fuck with me, okay?

15:30.863 --> 15:34.162
I hope you had sex last night
'cause I'm gonna cut off your dick.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.098
Then, I'm gonna feed it
to my pit...

15:36.168 --> 15:39.262
then I'm gonna burn the shit
when it comes out of my dog's ass.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.499
You hear me?
Don't fuck with me, bitch!

15:43.575 --> 15:45.543
What are you guys gonna do?

15:47.179 --> 15:49.773
Yo, Mack Daddy,
I don't know--

15:49.848 --> 15:52.078
You don't know?
Get the fuck outta here.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.847
Hold up, Mack, look...
- Get the fuck outta here!

15:54.920 --> 15:57.411
Let me talk to my boy,
he's trippin'--

15:57.489 --> 15:59.013
You motherfuckers
are wastin' my time.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.616
I got chumps lined up
tryin' to be down with this label.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.322
You get no second chance.
Get the fuck out.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.728
Please, let me talk to him.
We wanna do this...

16:06.799 --> 16:08.994
What's the matter with you, kid?
You deaf?

16:09.068 --> 16:11.002
Or are you just dumb,
like your mom...?

16:11.070 --> 16:13.095
I gotta bitch-smack you
like I used to do to her?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.697
Let me tell you something...
- Check yourself, kid.

16:15.774 --> 16:18.038
Don't even fuck around.
Just get out.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.477
You and your homeboys,
fucked up. This is real.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.674
Get these fuckin' losers out.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.817
Man, fuck him.
I ain't no loser.

16:31.623 --> 16:34.091
Man, this shit broker
than we is.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.992
Unless one of y'all big head niggas
win the lotto tomorrow...

16:37.062 --> 16:39.860
we can forget about the contest,
and goin' to Las Vegas.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.924
Now you talkin', motherfucker.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.731
The lotto.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.135
The lotto's hangin' around
that yard jockey's neck at Mack's.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.071
I've been thinkin'...

16:49.141 --> 16:51.769
everybody knows Mack be out
partyin' every night, right?

16:51.844 --> 16:56.304
We bust in there, grab the gold piece
off that yard jockey, huh?

16:59.051 --> 17:01.246
Oh, we just gonna
break into Mack's, huh?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.379
We gonna bust in there
and steal his shit, right?

17:03.455 --> 17:06.288
Stick 'em up, motherfucker!
Mack, gimme your shit.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.723
Yo, I'm serious, goddamnit!

17:08.794 --> 17:11.092
That shit got to be hot.

17:11.163 --> 17:15.031
We take that shit, we pawn that shit,
and get some new gear.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.159
Stray, we can't do that, man.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.965
He ain't gonna report that stolen.
That shit got to be hot.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.405
Stray, if we do that,
we ain't no better than Mack is.

17:23.509 --> 17:28.811
It's okay to play a bullshit scam
on Jackie Dee and Chow--

17:28.881 --> 17:32.248
but you too high and mighty
when it comes down to the real deal.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.808
Look, man, that was different,
and you know it.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.048
How you think that motherfucker
got where he is?

17:37.122 --> 17:40.387
He's done worse shit than us,
keepin' us brothers down...

17:40.459 --> 17:42.518
controlling who gets out
and who don't...

17:42.594 --> 17:45.791
It's time somebody took
something back, took some action.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.832
Kinda like Robin Hood...

17:47.900 --> 17:50.391
Instead, we gonna be
<robbin' in the hood.>

17:50.469 --> 17:53.097
Only with Uzis and AK's, baby.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.942
We talking about guns, now, too?

17:59.011 --> 18:00.979
You tell me, Post--
how else we gonna do it?

18:02.448 --> 18:05.542
Fuck that, man.
I'll see y'all on <Judge Judy>.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.247
We meet at MacKenzie Park,
6:30.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.485
We just playin'
the cards we're dealt, man.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.723
Like Mack said,
<ain't nothin' but a hip-hop thing.>

18:21.800 --> 18:24.030
Business in the hood.

18:26.772 --> 18:31.402
You ain't scared?
- Hell, no, I ain't scared.

18:31.477 --> 18:34.071
Ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready to do this.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.376
Let's do this.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.042
My nigga, man.
- I love you, man.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.916
Shit. Let's go to Vegas.
- Word. Let's do this, homie.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.323
Who the fuck is that?

18:50.395 --> 18:52.989
It's Post, man.
- Post?

18:53.065 --> 18:56.125
So what's the deal?
We gonna do this shit, or what?

18:59.037 --> 19:00.664
My nigga!

19:02.574 --> 19:04.235
Let's do this.
I love you, my friend.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.436
Look at this, y'all!

19:06.512 --> 19:08.104
Let's get money, baby.

19:08.180 --> 19:11.047
Yeah, baby.
- Yeah!

19:33.906 --> 19:36.067
Hey Post,

19:55.494 --> 19:57.325
Yo, Post!

19:58.330 --> 20:00.025

20:03.202 --> 20:05.534
What the fuck...?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.266
Oh, shit!

20:17.282 --> 20:19.580
Oh, shit, you done killed
that motherfucker!

20:22.988 --> 20:25.047
Get the gold
off that motherfucker, man.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.953
Unhand me gold,
you thieving hoods.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.615
You got more loot
than Tiger Woods.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.555
What the fuck is that?
- I don't know...

21:00.626 --> 21:02.617
Chuckie on crack!
Shoot that motherfucker!

21:18.076 --> 21:19.668
Come on, y'all!

21:45.103 --> 21:46.866
Come hither, me hand.
Come here.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.396
Together we will shake them
with fear.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.084
A lot of time
has come and passed.

22:06.191 --> 22:09.786
But still I see,
you're a big, fat ass.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.569
Goddamn phone.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.770
This is Mack.
I'm at the Parrot.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.833
Bring your ass down here
and bring some fuckin' guns.

22:25.911 --> 22:28.573
Big shit. Ugly shit.
Machine guns. It's goin' down.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.308
This shit is real.
Come, now!

22:31.950 --> 22:34.248
Get the hell outta here.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.023
Cool out.

22:50.635 --> 22:53.103
Shit...
calm down.

23:06.885 --> 23:11.549
Nigga...
get you some, okay?

23:11.623 --> 23:13.488
That's what you need;
you need chronic.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.753
Take it easy, bro'.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.791
You need to relax...
cool out.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.967
Smoke a joint.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.267
Yeah.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.804
Curious aroma.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.658
Interesting blend.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.596
<Interesting>, bullshit.
That's the bomb, right there.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.729
<The bomb>?

24:01.706 --> 24:04.903
Ahh... the bomb.

24:06.878 --> 24:10.075
A friend with weed,
is a friend, indeed.

24:11.416 --> 24:15.819
But, a friend with gold,
is the best, I'm told.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.087
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

24:27.165 --> 24:28.325
Gold.
- Gold, who?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.595
Gold finger.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.842
Now, find me gold
in record time...

24:39.911 --> 24:43.278
or you'll suffer
a bloody, hideous crime.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.946
I'm gonna kill that
little green motherfucker.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.487
Look at my fuckin' finger!
I'll kill his fuckin' ass!

24:57.028 --> 25:01.795
God-damn!
You little ugly motherfucker.

25:01.867 --> 25:05.268
On the ghost of Jack Sprat,
you must be trippin'!

25:10.775 --> 25:12.936
Mother-fuck it!

25:15.113 --> 25:18.207
What's that?

25:18.283 --> 25:19.910
It's rap.

25:19.985 --> 25:21.009
<Rap>?

25:21.086 --> 25:24.886
Rap, as in:
I'm gonna take this...

25:24.956 --> 25:27.254
and wrap it around
your scrawny, little, ugly ass!

25:47.412 --> 25:51.371
This is my prime gear.

25:51.449 --> 25:55.146
This better be the best you got
in this sorry motherfucker.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.745
Look at it.
You see what it is.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.153
Come on, look.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.022
How much for all of this?

26:02.093 --> 26:03.492
Tell you what I'll do.

26:03.562 --> 26:07.123
I'll give you all this gear
for everything you got in that bag.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.862
Nah, we need gear,
operating funds...

26:14.940 --> 26:18.535
You're drivin' a hard bargain.
I'll tell you what...

26:18.610 --> 26:24.276
I'll give you all this gear,
and $500.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.180
Six.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.775
575.
- 550.

26:27.852 --> 26:28.580
Deal.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.186
What about my warranty?

26:33.258 --> 26:37.592
You don't get no warranty.
You're lucky you don't get a warrant.

27:06.725 --> 27:09.250
What...?

27:12.430 --> 27:14.523
Are we done, or what?

27:14.599 --> 27:17.159
Uh... yeah.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.934
Yeah, pack that shit up, man.
We'll take it.

27:33.084 --> 27:34.745
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Smell that.

27:34.819 --> 27:38.277
Back up, motherfucker...
before I smack the shit outta you.

27:38.356 --> 27:43.350
Chow, we need some party supplies.
We wanna celebrate.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.521
Like the big dogs we is.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.929
You strike it rich.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.559
Hell, yeah, we struck it rich.
What do you think?

27:50.635 --> 27:54.765
I told you we would.
Time to get some poontang.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.500
You get down and jiggy
with bitches and ho's?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.565
That's right, Chow.

27:58.643 --> 28:01.806
What? You big time funky
hip-hop rappers now?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.678
You know, just about.
- What does it look like?

28:04.749 --> 28:07.980
We're goin' to Vegas.
We're about to win a contest.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.953
You do rap video yet?

28:10.021 --> 28:13.821
You do video, Chow dance.
Chow dance.

28:13.892 --> 28:18.352
No, I don't think we'll be
having you in our video, but...

28:21.332 --> 28:23.061
Chow know many dances.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.625
Chow do the "Funky Peasant".

28:25.704 --> 28:28.867
Chow get down hard
with his bad self.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.840
Shake his nasty groove thing.

28:33.278 --> 28:34.870
Chow no fake the funk, uh-uh.

28:34.946 --> 28:36.971
Chow keep it real.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.976
Chow have the music in me.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.272

29:09.314 --> 29:10.838
We done here, or what?

29:16.721 --> 29:18.586
Yeah...

29:18.656 --> 29:20.886
Hey, Chow...

29:20.959 --> 29:24.156
Bring that shit out, man.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.958
No dead shit, man.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.692
Chow one nasty mother.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.564
That's right, you nasty.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.342
In a matter of time,
the flute will be mine.

29:44.749 --> 29:46.740
The party's over
for those stealin' motherfuckers.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.786
I'm gonna kill them all.

29:48.853 --> 29:51.321
Then, I got something for that
little green piece of shit.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.119
Fuck, they got the flute.

29:58.196 --> 30:02.189
We gotta get that back
or our party's over... fuck.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.360
What are you doin'
just standin' there?

30:04.435 --> 30:06.960
Go get with them motherfuckers.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.516
What do you know?

30:19.584 --> 30:22.451
They dropped something.

30:23.855 --> 30:27.256
Little bastards are in for more shit
than they ever dreamed.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.757
Kinda scared me there, boy.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.562
I ain't buyin' Hallowe'en costumes...

30:40.638 --> 30:43.106
so you better trick-or-treat
your little ass on outta here.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.802
I'm here to claim
me gold and shillings.

30:45.877 --> 30:50.075
Now, give 'em back,
or there might be killings.

30:50.148 --> 30:54.744
Don't make me laugh.
You tryin' to rob Jackie Dee?

30:54.819 --> 30:57.811
What gang you belong to?
<The Shrimps>?

31:18.509 --> 31:20.568
Jackie Cee?

31:24.482 --> 31:26.450
Jackie Dee...

31:26.517 --> 31:29.611
Come here,
my big, strong man.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.712
Baby, you look beautiful.

31:31.789 --> 31:35.020
It's been too long, Jackie...
too long.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.960
But, I don't understand.
- You don't have to. Don't.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.221
I just want you to love me, baby.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.836
Oh, baby,
I've missed you so bad.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.901
Ooh, Jackie, I want you
to just love me.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.911
Jackie, I've missed you so much.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.849
Oh, baby.
Yes, Jackie.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.992
Baby, I missed you so bad.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.306
Love me, Jackie.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.997
Post...

32:56.741 --> 32:58.868
What the hell?
You shook the spot, man.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.445
This shit ain't right, y'all.

33:04.682 --> 33:08.209
We partyin' with money we robbed
from a motherfucker we killed.

33:10.588 --> 33:13.421
I killed.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.618
Post, it ain't like
we planned that shit at Mack's.

33:15.693 --> 33:19.322
That shit just got--hectic,
know what I'm sayin'?

33:21.199 --> 33:23.064
I don't know, man...

33:23.134 --> 33:25.159
but the bottom line is...

33:25.236 --> 33:27.170
it's over.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.039
Things will be different now,
I swear.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.050
All right, man.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.817
What's up, little bitches?

33:50.128 --> 33:52.824
Y'all niggas' asses is mine.

33:55.967 --> 33:59.130
Shoot me with my own gun?
Steal my shit?

33:59.203 --> 34:01.728
Bust up my motherfuckin' spot?

34:01.806 --> 34:03.603
Man, I'm sorry...

34:08.713 --> 34:11.341
You can die right here,
or you can jump...

34:11.416 --> 34:13.976
I don't give a fuck,
but you are gonna tell me one thing.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.315
Where's my fuckin' flute?
- What flute?

34:16.387 --> 34:17.853
Man, we ain't got no flute.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.014
Don't fuckin' play with me!
Where's the goddamn flute!

34:20.091 --> 34:22.059
We don't have no flute, Mack.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.356
You motherfuckers
think I'm bullshittin'.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.027
I'll blow their
motherfuckin' heads off.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.659
Aw, shit--!
My finger!

34:33.404 --> 34:35.599
Kill those motherfuckers!

34:41.579 --> 34:43.376
Come on, y'all!

34:43.447 --> 34:44.972
Let's get outta here.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.989
Fuck, fuck.
Y'all believe that shit?!

35:02.066 --> 35:04.091
That motherfuckin' ground
was sparkin' and shit.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.659
Fucked my knee up, man.

35:06.737 --> 35:09.638
Mack Daddy, his ghost came back
to get our ass, man.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.174
Shut up.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.075
How is somebody smart as you
gonna believe in ghosts?

35:14.145 --> 35:15.772
I told you before, straight...

35:15.847 --> 35:18.577
there be the physical,
then there be the metaphysical.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.675
That was some
meta-fuckin'-physical shit back there!

35:21.752 --> 35:24.243
I bet them bullets he was shootin'
was some physical shit.

35:24.322 --> 35:27.086
Who gives a fuck? Physical?
Metaphysical? Who cares?

35:27.158 --> 35:29.649
Mack Daddy's after our asses, y'all.

35:30.928 --> 35:32.896
And he wants this.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.432
Why didn't you give him
that shit back, Post?

35:35.500 --> 35:40.199
Nigga, I was scared...
shit.

35:40.271 --> 35:41.795
Fuck, man,
what are we gonna do?

35:41.873 --> 35:45.206
What can we do?
Lay low.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.541
We just get get to the audition,
win that motherfucker...

35:48.613 --> 35:50.342
and be in Vegas
for the big payoff.

35:50.414 --> 35:53.349
We can keep our gear with us.
Go from place to place...

35:53.417 --> 35:55.578
stay with someone different
every night.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.850
Who the fuck we gonna stay with?
Mack knows everybody in this town.

36:01.692 --> 36:06.686
So, what is it I can do for you,
<Stray Bullet>?

36:08.599 --> 36:11.796
<Postmaster P>,
and... Butch?

36:14.071 --> 36:15.868
We're gonna be goin'
on the road soon...

36:15.940 --> 36:19.307
gettin' practice,
goin' from place to place...

36:21.312 --> 36:23.872
We thought we'd stay
at your place tonight, then move on.

36:23.948 --> 36:29.250
We need to set up our equipment,
so we could have rehearsal.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.220
Get our groove on.

36:31.289 --> 36:34.725
You know I like to get my groove on.
I love me some company.

36:36.260 --> 36:39.889
I also love me some cash.
You know the drill. Hand it over.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.693
Ain't no scrubs up in here.

36:43.467 --> 36:49.235
Every little bit helps
Miss Fontaine get her operation.

36:49.307 --> 36:53.266
Go get your stuff. Go put it out back.
Let me hear you jam.

37:01.919 --> 37:03.682
Who's there?

37:07.858 --> 37:12.318
Counting ill-gotten gains
will cause you suffering and pain.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.696
Who's there?

37:52.703 --> 37:56.366
They call me Stray. You know that
I can pull it with no delay.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.308
I'm a waistband...don't you know
I'm from the wasteland...

38:00.378 --> 38:02.903
From the dome, I roam
through the chromozome...

38:02.980 --> 38:06.040
Come around, I pound you
in the head with red--

38:09.453 --> 38:11.318
Turn that shit off!

38:11.389 --> 38:13.448
Cut that shit off, man.

38:13.524 --> 38:16.220
What's the matter with you?
People tryin' to sleep here.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.353
Fuckin' assholes.

38:18.429 --> 38:21.023
That's what's wrong
with your bighead ass.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.861
Y'all don't understand
good-ass music.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.493
Yeah, the hell with you!

38:28.372 --> 38:29.498
Motherfucker.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.704
Fuck this, man.

38:34.779 --> 38:38.510
Where are you going?
You ain't gonna defend my honor?

38:38.582 --> 38:42.609
Come back here,
you sissy motherfuckers.

38:48.292 --> 38:51.193
We really fuckin' suck.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.325
Shit.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.925
Play some more.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.298
Yo, yo, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.902
Whack the Daddy Mack,
now we ain't got jack.

39:41.979 --> 39:44.277
Butch in full effect,
no, we ain't goin' back.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.873
No more wannabes,
no more <nigga, please>.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.385
Now, we're the big cheese,
who'd wanna say please.

39:49.453 --> 39:51.717
Dope is the track.
Gold got it back...

39:51.789 --> 39:54.257
Better get lost,
next step, that's a fact.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.816
This be the story,
ain't got no glory...

39:56.894 --> 39:59.454
No place to go but up,
that's where it's at!

39:59.530 --> 40:00.895
Yeah.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.592
Here we go.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.362
Here we--
here we go, y'all.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.869
Here we go...

40:06.937 --> 40:09.235
Here we--
here we go.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.630
Time for the show.

40:11.709 --> 40:15.611
Do what you gotta do.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.321
Do what you gotta do.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.250
Oh, handy...

41:05.796 --> 41:07.457
Yeah!

41:07.531 --> 41:10.625
Did we rock that shit?
- Rocked that shit.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.726
Homie, they couldn't get
enough of us.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.771
I could have got me some pussy.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.774
Straight to Vegas, baby.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.771
With Mack Daddy on our ass.
- Aw, fuck him.

41:22.847 --> 41:24.940
By the time he finds us...

41:25.015 --> 41:26.846
we're already gonna be large.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.548
He ain't gonna stop
until he gets this.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.680
Shit, give it to him.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.781
We can't.

41:36.527 --> 41:40.224
Shit, you boys
was too, too fine tonight.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.561
Good night, boys.

41:47.238 --> 41:50.901
Who was he talkin' to?
- He was talkin' to your ass.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.535
He was talking to you.
- He was talkin' to Post.

41:53.611 --> 41:56.079
Fuck that.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.738
You wanna hit that, Post?

42:12.863 --> 42:15.457
Couldn't find your way out, baby?

42:15.533 --> 42:18.434
Or, you just didn't wanna leave?

42:18.502 --> 42:23.371
I didn't come to play with fruit.
I only seek me magic flute.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.137
That's such a musical way
of putting it.

42:28.879 --> 42:31.074
You just the right size, too...

42:31.148 --> 42:33.446
for Miss Fontaine.

42:38.656 --> 42:42.752
I hope you ain't a screamer
'cause I got me some company.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.727
So get your ass up in there.
Come on now.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.535
Why you think Mack Daddy
wants it back so bad?

42:54.605 --> 42:57.039
That ain't no magic flute.
My ass.

43:01.712 --> 43:03.179
What the fuck was that?

43:07.985 --> 43:11.284
That's probably Fontaine
havin' a nightmare.

43:35.079 --> 43:37.809
Mr. Funny-Boy got company.

43:42.419 --> 43:44.819
Man, I'm gonna be sick, man.

44:02.773 --> 44:05.765
Shit--that little green motherfucker's
out there, man.

44:12.583 --> 44:17.111
Ohh, shit!
He ain't dead.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.485
Meta-fuckin'-physical, man.

44:19.556 --> 44:22.719
What are we gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

44:25.362 --> 44:27.990
What the fuck is we gonna do, y'all?

44:29.767 --> 44:32.429
Flute...
where's me flute?

44:35.305 --> 44:39.071
See, the mix of a douche...

44:43.280 --> 44:45.714
and a jelly...

44:45.783 --> 44:50.015
is very, very,
very combustible.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.148
Combustability...

44:55.225 --> 44:57.193
plus electricity...

44:59.563 --> 45:01.554
equals flammability.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.964
Damn, you smart, man.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.778
Post...

45:24.855 --> 45:27.255
go over there and cut the light on
when he comes in here.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.225
Stray...

45:33.297 --> 45:36.528
go and get the little
motherfucker in here, man.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.367
Come on, man.
- All right.

45:49.046 --> 45:52.607
Yo, shorty, you ain't even
as big as my dick.

46:11.168 --> 46:12.863
Now, Post, now!

46:39.263 --> 46:42.232
I don't get it.
This piece of shit?

46:42.299 --> 46:44.324
Y'all still don't get it?

46:44.401 --> 46:46.835
We fuckin' with
the spiritual world, man.

46:46.904 --> 46:50.499
We unleashed a whole supernatural
universal wack-pack.

46:50.574 --> 46:53.702
Sanctuary's against that shit.

46:53.777 --> 46:56.712
That's what we need right now,
some sanctuary.

46:56.780 --> 46:59.749
We need to go
to Rev. Hanson's church.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.150
We could slide him some Benjamins,
and stay there for the night.

47:03.220 --> 47:06.053
I gotta see my grandmother,
make sure she's all right.

47:06.123 --> 47:08.353
Post, is that you?

47:08.425 --> 47:10.985
Yeah, it's me, Grandma.
I lost my keys.

47:11.061 --> 47:13.154
Oh, all right.

47:17.968 --> 47:20.061
Hey, Grandma.

47:20.137 --> 47:22.264
Boy, where you been?

47:22.339 --> 47:25.103
I needed somebody
to massage my bunions.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.405
I had stuff to do
with Stray and Butch, that's all.

47:27.477 --> 47:31.675
Them lazy-ass hood boys.
You know they ain't good for nothin'.

47:34.551 --> 47:40.588
Oh, hello, Stray. How's your mama?
- She's good, Mrs. Smith.

47:40.657 --> 47:44.354
She still sneakin' around
with Jackie Dee?

47:51.435 --> 47:54.435
That you, Butch?
- Yes, ma'am.

47:54.504 --> 47:58.338
Boy, is you still a virgin?
- Yes, ma'am.

47:58.408 --> 48:00.205
What's wrong with you, son?

48:00.277 --> 48:03.735
Big ol' strappin' boy like you?
You got bad teeth or something?

48:03.814 --> 48:06.146
No, ma'am.

48:06.216 --> 48:08.684
There's hot soup over there
on the stove...

48:08.752 --> 48:11.118
with plenty of hot sauce
just like y'all like it.

48:12.656 --> 48:14.920
Why motherfuckers want this so bad?

48:14.992 --> 48:17.324
I'm tellin' you, man.
It's magical.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.487
Bullshit.

48:19.563 --> 48:22.498
Watch this.
Cover your ears.

48:31.341 --> 48:33.332
Butch?

48:35.445 --> 48:39.279
Sanctuary, man.
We need sanctuary... quick.

49:03.540 --> 49:05.872
The Lord, I say...!

49:05.943 --> 49:08.377
... is good.

49:08.745 --> 49:11.612
For he has delivered unto me...

49:11.682 --> 49:14.173
the worst of Satan's sinners.

49:14.251 --> 49:15.843
Praise God.

49:15.919 --> 49:18.979
Reverend Hanson, we need sanctuary
in your sanctuary.

49:19.056 --> 49:22.958
We tryin' to hide from Mack Daddy.
He's about to go on a killin' spree.

49:23.026 --> 49:24.618
We're the spree
he's tryin' to kill.

49:24.695 --> 49:28.461
You're saying you need a place
to slither away and hide out?

49:28.532 --> 49:31.194
Yeah, just for one day,
then we're outta here.

49:31.268 --> 49:36.467
Let's see... hotel rates run about...

49:36.540 --> 49:39.100
We give you $50 dollars,
and we square.

49:42.946 --> 49:47.042
That's nice, real nice.
But there's one more thing.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.278
What?

49:49.353 --> 49:53.289
Our musical entertainment
for this morning got cancelled.

49:53.357 --> 49:56.588
Seems, the lead singer
got his ass arrested again.

49:57.627 --> 50:00.221
I know you boys
are musically inclined...

50:00.297 --> 50:03.494
and I suspect you might be
available for...

50:03.567 --> 50:04.727
one song.

50:07.804 --> 50:09.101
It's so good...

50:09.239 --> 50:11.707
to see a full house,
in the Lord's house.

50:13.910 --> 50:16.640
Amen.

50:16.713 --> 50:20.809
As we pass the collection plate...

50:21.451 --> 50:23.009
I want you to remember one thing.

50:23.086 --> 50:25.646
The Lord, I say...

50:25.722 --> 50:28.213
the Lord, sees everything.

50:29.626 --> 50:32.254
The Lord don't like cheap.

50:33.630 --> 50:37.361
So I want you to dig deep
into your pockets, now...

50:37.434 --> 50:39.163
and show your love.

50:40.170 --> 50:43.731
But first, about our musical
entertainment for today...

50:45.375 --> 50:48.674
We have three young lads
coming to you...

50:48.745 --> 50:51.680
straight from the Southside
of Jerusalem.

50:51.748 --> 50:54.444
I said, the Southside of Jerusalem.

50:54.518 --> 50:57.487
I want you to make these boys
feel welcome today.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.284
Bring 'em on down,
and show some love.

51:04.594 --> 51:06.323
Lord works in mysterious ways...

51:06.396 --> 51:08.421
Amen, man.

51:10.267 --> 51:12.201
The Lord is good.

51:16.506 --> 51:22.206
Jesus loves me,
this I know...

51:23.447 --> 51:28.180
If he don't,
I'll find a... ho'.

51:35.892 --> 51:38.588
His mama's name was--

51:38.662 --> 51:42.257
Mary... Jo.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.499
And his disciples was--

51:49.573 --> 51:53.805
... some bad mo' fo's...

51:58.014 --> 52:00.812
That's fine, fellas, that's fine.

52:00.884 --> 52:04.820
The Lord has heard many
a strange tongue in this house.

52:04.888 --> 52:08.187
And we have learned
not to judge what we see...

52:08.258 --> 52:11.887
but to the content,
and the fiber of a young--

52:38.255 --> 52:40.416
Yo, that's... Coolio.

52:44.327 --> 52:47.319
Jesus loves me, this I know...

52:47.397 --> 52:49.490
If he don't, I find a ho'.

52:49.566 --> 52:52.433
His mama's name, was Mary Jo...

52:52.502 --> 52:54.766
His disciples was some bad mo' fo's.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.136
Little ones, goin' out
to the crack house...

52:57.207 --> 52:59.869
They're all weak,
Jesus gave a shout out...

52:59.943 --> 53:02.377
<Try to stay strong,
'cause we belong...

53:02.445 --> 53:04.879
To the fold,
we gone before long.>

53:04.948 --> 53:07.473
Jesus loves me...
- I don't know...

53:07.551 --> 53:10.076
Jesus loves me...
- The hell if I know.

53:10.153 --> 53:12.383
If Jesus loves me,
then it's my day.

53:12.455 --> 53:15.253
We better pray...
- Or he'll make us pay.

53:15.325 --> 53:17.919
The Lord's name,
I take it in vain.

53:17.994 --> 53:20.428
Why don't you, Jesus,
come stop the pain?

53:20.497 --> 53:22.624
Jesus works in a mysterious way.

53:22.699 --> 53:25.634
That ain't no answer,
I'm gonna do it my way.

53:25.702 --> 53:28.136
Jesus loves us,
we don't know...

53:28.205 --> 53:30.639
Jesus loves us?
The hell if we know.

53:30.707 --> 53:33.005
Jesus works in a mysterious way...

53:33.076 --> 53:35.840
That ain't no answer.
We gonna do it our way.

53:35.912 --> 53:37.379
Yeah.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.078
Three bad boys.

53:42.152 --> 53:44.177
Give it up,
come on, now.

53:55.432 --> 53:57.263
Damn.

53:57.334 --> 53:58.767
You believe me now?

54:00.837 --> 54:03.362
No wonder Mack Daddy
was so pissed off.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.237
This is fortune,
right here.

54:05.308 --> 54:07.003
That's right.

54:09.879 --> 54:11.676
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

54:13.350 --> 54:15.318
That's the key, man.

54:15.385 --> 54:18.047
The key to everything
we ever wanted.

54:18.121 --> 54:20.954
Man, that's the key
to our goddamn coffin.

54:21.024 --> 54:24.084
Y'all must be forgettin'
Mack Daddy gonna kill our ass...

54:24.160 --> 54:25.752
if he don't get that shit back.

54:25.829 --> 54:27.990
We went in his house,
fucked his shit up...

54:28.064 --> 54:32.401
You think he'll let us live,
'cause we gave him his flute back?

54:34.704 --> 54:36.831
Aw, shit, man.
We're about to find out.

54:39.542 --> 54:41.305
Oh, shit.

54:41.645 --> 54:43.772
I'm sure the motherfuckers is up there.

55:00.196 --> 55:02.096
We don't go down
without a fight.

55:03.233 --> 55:05.724
Right?
- Right.

55:05.802 --> 55:07.667
Right?

55:07.737 --> 55:10.001
Right.

55:10.073 --> 55:12.337
Right?
- Right.

55:32.929 --> 55:34.794
Freeze, you little
stealin' motherfuckers!

55:38.368 --> 55:41.531
I finally got your ass.
Where's my goddamn flute?

55:41.604 --> 55:44.232
I got your flute. I don't have it on me,
but I know where it is.

55:44.307 --> 55:46.502
Stop fuckin' with me!
Gimme the goddamn flute, now!

55:46.576 --> 55:49.602
I can get the flute, but if you kill me
then you can't have it.

55:51.614 --> 55:54.777
What about Mr. Leprechaun?
The flute belongs to him, anyway.

55:54.851 --> 55:57.149
Fuck that little motherfucker.
I should've killed him a long time ago.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.619
Fuck him.

55:58.688 --> 56:00.622
You need to figure out
what you're going to do about him...

56:00.690 --> 56:03.454
because he's right behind your ass.

56:03.526 --> 56:05.153
I'm supposed to fall for that shit?

56:05.228 --> 56:07.890
That's the oldest trick in the book.
You gotta come better than that, nigga.

56:07.964 --> 56:10.125
Blow this motherfucker's head off.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.861
With pleasure.

56:11.935 --> 56:14.165
Did somebody say, <blow>?

56:14.237 --> 56:16.000
Hallelujah.

56:35.525 --> 56:37.516
You were sayin'?

56:47.103 --> 56:48.832
I'll get back
with you niggas later.

56:51.441 --> 56:53.033
All right, dammit,
what the hell is goin' on...?!

56:59.048 --> 57:01.016
What the hell you boys
think you're doin'?

57:01.084 --> 57:03.143
Man, we got the whole world
after our ass.

57:03.219 --> 57:05.653
<The whole world>?
- Only the bad motherfuckers.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.434
Why don't you give
the little bastard his flute...

57:22.505 --> 57:24.666
and let's get up outta here, man?

57:46.329 --> 57:48.661
We dealin' with some evil
supernatural shit here, man.

58:08.284 --> 58:09.945
I got an idea.

58:24.567 --> 58:28.401
All kidding aside...
it's time to die.

58:44.554 --> 58:46.249
Damn...

58:46.322 --> 58:49.189
What kinda voodoo shit
you boys into?

59:08.144 --> 59:12.478
You can stop that goddamned yelling.
This is the Lord's house!

59:12.549 --> 59:14.983
Ain't nobody in here
afraid of your ass.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.352
I don't hear nothin'.

59:20.423 --> 59:21.981
Let's try it again.

59:33.937 --> 59:37.964
It's hooked up right, man.
We can't sample it.

59:38.041 --> 59:39.633
It won't record.

59:39.709 --> 59:42.177
Fuck it.
We gotta use the real deal.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.577
Either way, we're going to Vegas
for the big money.

59:44.647 --> 59:47.207
Straight up.
Let's get this show on the road.

59:47.283 --> 59:48.648
Let's do this shit.

59:48.718 --> 59:50.481
Vegas? What the fuck
y'all talkin' about, "Vegas"?

59:50.553 --> 59:52.521
Nobody goin' nowhere with that thing
locked up in my office.

59:52.589 --> 59:56.286
You know what?
Just keep that safe locked.

59:56.359 --> 01:00:00.125
You expect me to babysit
the goddamn Devil, huh?

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.596
He's up there sittin'
on my operating funds.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.099
Reverend, we're about
to hit the jackpot.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:07.033
When we come back,
we'll split the pot with you.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.037
Then, we'll figure out
what to do with that fuckin' devil.

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:11.869
Just make sure
his ass don't get out.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.966
Let's get out of here, man.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.671
What about Mack Daddy, man?

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:29.085
What about Mack Daddy?

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.752
Youngblood, how'd you know
about my gun?

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:34.126
Aw, man, who don't know
about your gun?

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:40.362
From the depths of the nether world,
I summon you...

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.870
me zombie fly girls.

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.820
Hit the ground,
hit the ground... run...

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:06.521
Hit the ground, run...
hit the ground...

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.564
Here come the man,
he got no school...

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.664
Brought an AK,
he ain't gonna lose...

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.760
Smoke the motherfucker,
from the moment we cruise.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.702
Karma, drama,
now we're on the run...

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.638
Motherfucker don't stay down,
you're done.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.903
Pop-pop, bang-bang,
here we come again...

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.968
We hit the ground,
runnin' while we can.

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:31.454
Hit the ground,
Hit the ground--running...

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.347
Toke to the joint,
we can take no more...

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.450
Posse, partyin',
drinks and whores...

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.495
Chillin', thrillin',
pump up the stereo...

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.427
Boom, goes the door,
fucked-up scenario.

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.488
We go runnin',
bullets keep comin'...

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.591
We hit the ground,
the joint keep burnin'...

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.465
Me and my partner,
we gonna get free...

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.664
Just gotta pass
this motherfuckin' D.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:54.073
Hit, hit,
hit the ground running.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.281
... hit the ground, runnin'!

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.330
Sweet Jesus.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.389
Another sinner.

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.099
Come, my child.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.706
Come and let me
lay hands upon your...

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.936
sinful creature.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:33.004
And pass on to you...

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.949
the blessings of the Lord.

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:38.748
Do you have the gift
of healing, Reverend?

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.517
Oh, yes, my child.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.116
Indeed, I do.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.684
But, my specialty...

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:51.393
is the gift of tongues.

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:08.308
I know the evil serpent beast
when I see him.

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:12.913
Now, get thee hence
from the house of the Lord.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.581
Now, begone from the--

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:33.337
Praise thee, good Reverend.
Now, give up me golden flute.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.780
Stray bullet to the heart...

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.476
Then you start bullshittin'
with time and space.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.213
Rap moves at the drop of a dime,
any motherfuckin' place...

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:46.187
Leave you in a puddle
of your warm blood...

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.485
I go home...

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.033
I'm the hardest
you ever saw--you're my target.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.229
Stray Bullet to the heart.

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:23.015
Stray Bullet to the heart.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:36.894
Stray Bullet to the heart--
what's the matter, bitch?

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:41.105
Hell, yeah!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:46.939
They loved us, loved us,
we rocked the show.

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:57.448
Berry Grady, vice president of A&R
for Dope Discs Productions.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:05:00.222
The biggest hip-hop label
in history?

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.821
Guilty as charged, homeboy.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.924
Hope you're ready for the finals.
- The finals?

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:07.162
You made it.
You are going to Vegas.

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.565
Ain't in it but to win it,
know what I'm sayin'?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.768
Your music's got a real
special quality.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.834
And the kids are down with it.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.312
We're just keepin' it real.
The shit is sellin'.

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.906
You perform in Vegas
like you did tonight...

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.884
you're a stone bet to win.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:28.720
Tuesday night, 8pm, be at LAX.
Congratulations, fellas.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:31.259
Thank you, Mr. Grady.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.124
We goin' to Vegas...!

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:42.334
Yeah, baby, we goin' to Vegas,
cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching!

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.805
Hey, party in here?

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.045
Oh, shit...
hell, yeah!

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:53.138
If y'all partyin'...
this is it!

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:12.764
The crowds were impressed,
they loved every note.

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:16.669
But how will you sound
from the bottom of me moat?

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:19.299
Give me the flute.
- Hell, no!

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:33.781
Uncomfortable, lad?
I'm sorry.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.189
Is this better?

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:46.757
I'll give you a choice.
Me patience is drained.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:50.897
Give me the flute...
or I paint the wall with his brains.

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.066
Okay, okay...

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.571
Post, give it up, man.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.806
Give him
the goddamned flute, Post.

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.307
Post, give him
the motherfuckin' flute!

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.709
Now, let them go.

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:38.953
As they say, lad,
<so near, and yet so far.>

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:43.321
Now live with the thought.
You were almost a star.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:49.064
Ladies...

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.530
Fuck you.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.082
No, Post...
no.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.529
No!

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:05.974
Man, we gotta go.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.676
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.511
We was gonna make the climb
with the positive shit.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:19.013
That was a long time ago.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.586
So, it's over?

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:28.152
Stray died for nothing?

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:32.359
A stinkin' corpse in a shitty car
to be found by some wino?

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:37.599
Man, it's over.
What are we gonna do?

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.442
I don't know.

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:48.174
It's over, Post.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.015
Go home, man.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:56.820
Go home.

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:27.678
Does she meet with your approval?

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:46.939
She's the bomb.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.765
Who's that?

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:36.254
You must be one of Post's
little friends.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:39.556
You must want
some of that food I made.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.892
Ooh, child.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:47.732
You got the arthritis real bad.

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:51.068
Your little hands
is all knotted up...

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.667
You need some good food
in your stomach.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.677
That's what you need.

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:59.612
Now, go on,
and go wash up.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:04.016
Go on, go wash
them filthy little hands.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.714
Let some hot water
run down over them.

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:30.574
I'm gonna feed you, on account of
your hands is knotted up...

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:33.308
and you can't hold
these here utensils.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.063
Good.
- Thank you.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:14.180
Stray...

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:34.238
We goin' to Vegas, baby!
We gonna be large!

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.858
Stray...

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:07.306
Yo, Post, it's all right.
It's me.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:10.209
Butch...
what's up, man?

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.270
I don't want you goin'
by yourself, man.

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:13.780
Goin' where?

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.875
To get the Leprechaun.
To get that flute back.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:19.648
How do you know I'm goin'?
- Ain't you?

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.324
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.421
What the hell is that
around your damn head?

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.431
I got a plan, man.

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.323
Yo, Post

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.631
I was reading earlier...

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:37.194
Leprechauns is rumored to be
the dark elves of Satan.

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:40.002
Each with his own pot of gold.

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:42.635
They so small, peeps are always
tryin' to capture 'em.

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:46.078
The gold is the ransom
for their freedom.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.275
Anybody fuckin' with their shit...

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.342
is hunted down and killed
in a most brutal manner.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.116
Yeah, no shit.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.713
So, what's your plan?

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.198
This.

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:04.357
Weed?

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:07.493
Man, this ain't just weed, Post.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:10.504
This weed's got clovers in it.
Four-leaf clovers.

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:11.903
What?

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.875
According to this book...

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.241
a leprechaun can lose
his powers temporarily...

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:20.975
if he's hit with the essence
of a four-leaf clover.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.744
How are we supposed
to find the Leprechaun?

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:25.013
I was sneaking around
the Golden Parrot.

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:27.647
The Leprechaun got
a goddamn room upstairs.

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:30.191
He got them zombie ho's
hypnotizing people.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:33.251
Taking them up to him,
every night.

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:36.058
Word? What for?
- I don't know...

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:38.793
but they don't be comin' back
downstairs after they go up.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.528
I think he's fuckin' 'em to death.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:44.333
We gotta get in there,
get him stoned off these clovers...

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.239
grab the flute, and run like hell
while he's still trippin'.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.308
That's a good plan, Post.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.046
How are we supposed
to get close to his ass?

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.984
Only one way, bro'.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.324
Remember,
Mack Daddy's still out there.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.833
he gonna be comin'
after our ass, too.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.533
Fuck Mack Daddy.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.101
Ain't nothin' but a hip-hop thang.

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.672
Business in the hood.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.680
Let's do this.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.979
Lep in the hood...
come to do no good.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.882
What happened?

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.391
Tell me where the Leprechaun is.

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:47.553
It's okay, just tell me where he is,
and I'll let you go.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:02.677
Damn, Post.
You look good, for real.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.406
Fuck you, nigga.
You ready for this shit?

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.608
I'm ready for this shit, man.
Let's do it.

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:26.433
Mr. Leprechaun?

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:29.237
Mr. Leprechaun?

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:33.232
Yo... Mr. Leprechaun!

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.804
Gotcha some new,
fresh, ho' meat...

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:42.011
and some special weed.

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:48.288
Come closer, come closer
my fresh young lass.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:56.259
Let me take a look at you,
before I tap your ass.

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:14.379
Sit down, sit down,
my healthy filly.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.078
You're about to meet
a club named, <Billy>.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:38.028
They say in the hood,
you're never down...

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:44.202
unless you've the courage
to go downtown.

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:21.473
Come on, man.

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:31.089
On to Vegas, baby.
- All the way for Stray, man.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:39.498
Butch...?

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.267
Not in a dress, Post...

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.270
You're gonna be okay, man.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.675
Is there pussy in heaven, Post?

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:06.018
Okay, little girls,
come on out!

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:09.029
You can't hide.
It's goin' down.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.163
Come on out, bitches.
Mack Daddy wants his flute.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.084
What's up, <sexy>?

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.646
Man, I must say,
you are fine.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:41.586
Are you finished playing?
Gimme the goddamn flute.

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.631
Fuck you, motherfucker.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.031
Oh, yeah, fuck me...

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.228
You look real tough,
you got a gun and everything...

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.895
but you ain't about to kill shit.

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:53.168
Plus, you're forgetting about
the little motherfucker upstairs.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.777
There's only one way to deal with him,
and that's me.

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:02.983
I got the one thing that can
put that leprechaun on ice forever.

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:05.485
So, what you gonna do, tough guy?
You gonna try to kill me...

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.612
or are we gonna work together
and kill this motherfucker?

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.919
'Cause you ain't
no motherfucking gangster.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.585
I'm supposed to trust you now?

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:17.860
I wouldn't advise you to trust me;
that'd be the worst thing you could do.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.493
But right now,
we got no options.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:23.298
And you really ain't got no options.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:26.306
You ain't no motherfucking gangster.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.437
Get that gun out of my face.
You ain't about to kill nothin'...

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.940
Cross-dressing impostor!

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:24.730
For a foe of mine,
you've done quite well.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:29.702
Now, I'll take me flute,
and send you to hell.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:33.366
If this is to be Post's last stand...

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:37.434
you'll have to take this flute
from me cold, dead hand.

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:41.910
I'll take it from you, homie,
you'll see...

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:46.352
'cause you know the Lep
is the real O.G.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:55.421
What are you gonna do
about Mack Daddy?

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.522
Behind me?

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:03.698
A valiant try,
and right on cue...

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:08.402
but if I fall for that,
I'm as stupid as you.

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.034
Mack Daddy ain't dyin' today.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.050
Motherfucker.

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:47.681
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Postmaster P!

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.309
The king of the world,
yeah, yeah, that's me...

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.945
I'm finally the man
that I've been strivin' to be.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.785
I passed the test,
they fucked my nest...

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:58.724
but I made it to the top,
put your fears to rest.

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:01.421
The king of the world,
yeah, yeah, that's me...

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:04.192
I'm finally the man
that I've been strivin' to be.

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.893
I passed the test,
they fucked my nest...

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:09.994
but I made it to the top,
put your fears to rest.

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:12.539
The king of the world,
yeah, yeah, that's me...

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.235
I'm finally the man
that I've been strivin' to be.

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:18.006
I passed the test,
they fucked my nest...

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:21.071
but I made it to the top,
put your fears to rest.

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:23.777
The king of the world,
yeah, yeah, that's me...

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.377
I'm finally the man
that I've been strivin' to be.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:29.218
I passed the test,
they fucked my nest...

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.487
but I made it to the top,
put your fears to rest.

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:59.349
I taught him
everything he knows.

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.794
I come from the land
of the Irish spring.

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.895
Dublin's the place
where I learned my thing.

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:20.065
From the Emerald lsle
to your place in the hood...

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:22.473
I'm the man of green,
come to do no good.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:26.810
Lep in the hood,
come to do no good.

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.872
Blunt is dope,
this place is hype.

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:31.384
There's a lassie,
she's just my type.

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.283
I hate to resort
so soon to magic...

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:35.822
Haven't been laid so long,
it's tragic.

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:40.921
I'm so bad, I'm good.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.157
I'll show you what to do,
so lend an ear...

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:46.291
don't worry, little lassie,
you've got nothin' to fear.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.562
Sit with a lad who's
lean and green...

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.036
and let me show you why
I'm a love machine.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.408
... come to do no good.

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.504
I'm a wee green guy,
who's new to town...

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:01.549
Show me what you do
when you get down.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.811
I'll go up,
you go down...

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.285
We'll all see your love green.

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:08.480
Lep in the hood,
come to do no good.

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:11.354
Lep in the hood,
when we're bad, we're good.

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:14.625
From the cliffs of more
to your front door...

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.755
Better turn out the lights
and pray some more.

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.958
Gonna party through the night
until the dawn...

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:21.228
and you and I
are gonna get it on.

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:26.672
Lep in the hood,
come to do no good.

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.549
Lep in the hood
come to do no good.

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:17.754
Lep in the hood
come to do no good.
