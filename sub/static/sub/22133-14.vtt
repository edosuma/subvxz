special investigator from the governor's
office governor's office yes we're

07:28.769 --> 07:33.359
looking into an incident last weekend in
waikiki seems that while you're heating

07:33.360 --> 07:35.100
praise on this boy

07:35.100 --> 07:39.570
others from the business community and
city council want to see him arrested if

07:39.569 --> 07:42.569
not for attempted murder at least for
criminal mischief

07:43.079 --> 07:48.180
you gotta be kidding me this could save
someone's life Nicki Tanaka's yes that's

07:48.180 --> 07:52.949
not what he says and what Tanaka says
carries a lot of weight with

07:52.949 --> 07:56.250
Councilwoman Jenna avid fanning the
flames

07:56.250 --> 07:59.250
you've got a problem captain

08:09.249 --> 08:13.389
that was great guys by the end of this
Junior Lifeguard program you'll be able

08:13.389 --> 08:16.838
to swim out to that buoy and back and
half the time

08:16.838 --> 08:19.928
now I'm gonna introduce you to the
instructor is going to help get you

08:19.928 --> 08:23.978
there and teach you some techniques and
attitudes that a foundation for

08:23.978 --> 08:27.248
life-saving Zach McEwen

08:27.249 --> 08:30.489
thanks Sean a house it guys

08:31.269 --> 08:35.589
I'm not exactly sure why Sean picked me
for this gig

08:36.158 --> 08:42.099
maybe because i'm the most recent grad
of his training but probably because I'm

08:42.099 --> 08:45.519
just as goofy and half wax as you guys
are

08:45.519 --> 08:51.370
anyway so we're going to do some
physical training here but the main

08:51.370 --> 08:55.929
thing we're going to be pounding into
your head is technique awareness and

08:55.929 --> 08:57.759
communication

08:57.759 --> 09:00.879
and ok for instance what am i doing now

09:02.379 --> 09:05.379
anybody

09:05.899 --> 09:09.949
hit I'm not checking for BL going for
help

09:10.460 --> 09:16.850
hey you got it that's the International
distress signal recognized by rescue

09:16.850 --> 09:19.850
professionals and waters all over the
world

09:24.019 --> 09:27.919
you know for the life of me I can't
figure out why the governor's office

09:27.919 --> 09:30.919
wants to poke around a little operation
like mine

09:30.919 --> 09:34.039
this can't really be about collecting
read

09:34.039 --> 09:39.738
it's not about you okay

09:41.259 --> 09:46.659
you want to expand the matter you want
me to get back to work and try to ignore

09:46.659 --> 09:47.049
it

09:47.049 --> 09:50.049
walk with me

09:51.159 --> 09:55.568
a relatively small operation captain
Monroe your training centers getting a

09:55.568 --> 10:00.549
lot of attention here on the mainland
and even to a small degree

10:00.549 --> 10:02.049
internationally

10:02.049 --> 10:06.849
that was the idea but we can't get
straight is why you have to make so many

10:06.850 --> 10:08.500
enemies in the process

10:08.500 --> 10:12.399
cancer woman Jenna advocate and a
predecessor McKenna

10:12.399 --> 10:18.009
he was corrupt she had personal issues
detective came on a little police

10:18.009 --> 10:22.688
Jim Reed long who harbor patrol okay
yeah I stepped on Kane's toes but he was

10:22.688 --> 10:25.208
wrong about a homicide as far as Reed is
concerned

10:25.208 --> 10:29.528
the guy was ignoring someone responsible
for shark attacks and now Hideki Tanaka

10:29.528 --> 10:35.588
one of the most influential businessmen
in the states combined now he's the

10:35.589 --> 10:38.800
father of one of my best guards he's got
an agenda with her

10:38.799 --> 10:43.059
look the point is simple and one you
should appreciate the government likes

10:43.059 --> 10:48.338
your program you know it brings a bit of
shine to the islands you though

10:48.909 --> 10:55.149
coming a problem that so well this is my
program and without me

10:55.899 --> 11:01.208
doesn't exist fine then for everybody's
sake you better hope things start

11:01.208 --> 11:04.208
quieting down

11:05.639 --> 11:08.470

15:52.769 --> 15:57.509
I've read your history Sean and I've
watched you work with your people they

15:57.509 --> 16:01.678
respect you a lot between us

16:01.678 --> 16:06.600
I don't think the centre will survive
without you good then the state will do

16:06.600 --> 16:10.110
the right thing and indemnify me against
was frivolous lawsuits which by the way

16:10.110 --> 16:13.048
are completely tied to my official
duties

16:13.048 --> 16:17.308
you can throw some government attorneys
against them and I can continue training

16:17.308 --> 16:19.798
lifeguards and they can continue saving
lives

16:19.798 --> 16:23.039
the government won't fight this for you
Sean

16:23.039 --> 16:26.578
and I'm not asking to Jackie and I've
been fighting my own battles my whole

16:26.578 --> 16:29.068
life but this isn't a battle it's a
setup

16:29.068 --> 16:32.068
maybe so but the fact is you're on your
own

16:32.639 --> 16:38.100
fine but I'm gonna beat this you know
hope so

16:38.100 --> 16:43.739
one more thing the state safety board is
having hearing regarding your status in

16:43.739 --> 16:48.569
three days until then you're not to be
on state beaches in any official

16:48.568 --> 16:53.849
capacity for step in your training
center at all until the board is made a

16:53.850 --> 16:55.528
decision on your future

16:55.528 --> 16:59.909
that was quick so much for innocent till
proven guilty

17:03.820 --> 17:08.318
yeah

17:08.318 --> 17:11.378
the ocean lifeguard training manual

17:11.380 --> 17:17.589
it is our bible and your friend ok but
life-saving is a growing and fluid thing

17:17.588 --> 17:23.708
to Brian keilana has added a ton to our
understanding of risk management how to

17:23.709 --> 17:28.209
judge when and how much risk to take in
any situation

17:28.209 --> 17:32.649
ok anybody know what are the two worst
enemies we face in life saving

17:37.690 --> 17:45.190

helping hand

34:01.980 --> 34:08.668
also a good point no it's not going to
be a pleasant meeting for you Sean

34:08.668 --> 34:13.079

you desperately want your scalp

34:14.760 --> 34:17.360
any hidden allies

34:17.360 --> 34:19.159
yeah

34:19.159 --> 34:21.868
not saying

34:21.869 --> 34:25.010
yeah

34:25.010 --> 34:32.929
so that I weighing all my options and I
realize that you play chess game

34:33.710 --> 34:41.719
you only left out one element love not
love or not

34:41.719 --> 34:45.049
family's always been at the center of
everything I've ever done

34:45.050 --> 34:50.690
you once told me a complete player at
any game chess checkers or hanafuda

34:50.690 --> 34:53.059
never discounts

34:53.059 --> 34:58.340
what's important to the other player I
know you feel JD is very important to

34:58.340 --> 35:03.019
you and so is life guarding i simply
found a way to put these two in

35:03.019 --> 35:04.759
opposition of each other

35:04.760 --> 35:08.000
now it's your choice your choice

35:08.000 --> 35:15.769
maybe you'll learn something from this
or maybe you do if you know how

35:15.769 --> 35:18.769
important something is to your opponent

35:19.429 --> 35:27.679
it has no wait right for instance I will
never give up JD or hide my love for him

35:27.679 --> 35:32.239
from you or anybody else in the world
and you can burn down the training

35:32.239 --> 35:38.689
center destroyed my friends and bring my
world down around my feet but all of

35:38.690 --> 35:43.700
that would be you're doing and yours to
live with but your choices have

35:43.699 --> 35:45.049
consequences

35:45.050 --> 35:50.210
you must be able to accept them why
because you made them up

35:50.210 --> 35:57.829
no father you made a fatal mistake in
this game and you made it early in you

35:57.829 --> 36:02.449
