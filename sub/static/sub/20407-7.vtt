00:02.140 --> 00:03.941
(Male announcer)
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.995 --> 00:05.996
It may have only been morning...
(All)
Morning, chef.

00:06.063 --> 00:08.198
(Announcer)
But chef Ramsay began the day
with a shocking move...

00:08.266 --> 00:10.200
Melissa, give me your jacket,

00:10.268 --> 00:11.835
because you're
in the blue team.

00:11.902 --> 00:12.969
(Announcer)
To wake up Melissa.

00:13.037 --> 00:14.571
Now I want to see you shine.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.373
(Announcer)
But he didn't stop there...

00:16.440 --> 00:17.874
Red team,
you're lacking a leader.

00:17.942 --> 00:19.676
(Announcer)
Asking Trev to step up.

00:19.744 --> 00:22.112
Trev, your jacket
and the red team.

00:22.179 --> 00:24.514
(Announcer)
Then, in the creative-salad
challenge...

00:24.582 --> 00:26.316
(Gordon)
I want to see how
imaginative you are.

00:26.384 --> 00:27.517
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay invited
the senior food editor

00:27.585 --> 00:29.152
of <i>bon appetit</i> to judge.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.754
This lady knows her stuff.

00:32.456 --> 00:33.690
It's a lovely salad.
Thank you.

00:33.758 --> 00:35.058
(Announcer)
The bad...

00:35.126 --> 00:36.426
This dish minds me
of a hot dog.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.360
(Announcer)
And the ugly.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.461
It's visually
a train wreck.

00:38.529 --> 00:39.763
(Announcer)
But there was one dish

00:39.830 --> 00:40.997
that stood out
above the rest...

00:41.065 --> 00:42.699
The scallop
was perfectly cooked.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.534
(Announcer)Elonged to.
Congratulations.

00:44.602 --> 00:45.935
(Announcer)
Who clinched it
for the blue team.

00:46.003 --> 00:47.370
Good job, buddy.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.705
(Announcer)
During dinner service...

00:48.773 --> 00:50.407
Trevor,
welcome to the red team.

00:50.474 --> 00:52.275
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen...
Come on, girls!

00:52.343 --> 00:53.510
(Announcer)
Gail pushed out
the appetizers...

00:53.577 --> 00:54.644
Gail, delicious,
delicious, delicious.

00:54.712 --> 00:56.112
Thank you, chef.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.480
(Announcer)
But Sabrina on garnish...

00:57.548 --> 00:58.648
Where's the rest?
Come on!

00:58.716 --> 00:59.783
Can't do it all!
I can't do it all!

00:59.850 --> 01:00.750
(Announcer)
And Nona on fish...

01:00.818 --> 01:02.185
They're not coloring, man.

01:02.253 --> 01:03.320
(Announcer)
Failed to deliver.

01:03.387 --> 01:04.421
Scallops are raw!

01:04.488 --> 01:05.488
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...

01:05.556 --> 01:06.623
How long on scallops?

01:06.691 --> 01:07.590
(Announcer)
Russell took charge.

01:07.658 --> 01:08.224
Focus.
I am focused.

01:08.292 --> 01:10.093
No, you're not!

01:10.161 --> 01:12.395
(Announcer)
But Boris was a disaster
on garnish.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.030
I like [Bleep] Mashed potatoes!
You're a [Bleep] Embarrassment!

01:14.098 --> 01:15.732
Get out!

01:15.800 --> 01:17.567
(Announcer)
And Melissa followed
up a performance

01:17.635 --> 01:19.602
where she overcooked
a mountain of meat

01:19.670 --> 01:21.971
by ruining a sea
of scallops.

01:22.039 --> 01:23.506
I [Bleep] The team, chef.

01:23.574 --> 01:24.774
I've had enough!

01:24.842 --> 01:26.076
(Announcer)
Both teams...

01:26.143 --> 01:27.644
That was horrific.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.145
(Announcer)
Had to nominate one person...

01:29.213 --> 01:30.847
The red team
has nominated Sabrina.

01:30.915 --> 01:33.083
The blue team
nominated Boris.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.218
(Announcer)
But chef Ramsay wasn't satisfied
with the nominees.

01:35.286 --> 01:37.387
(Gordon)
Nona, Melissa, step forward.

01:37.455 --> 01:39.689
(Announcer)
And in the end it was...
Melissa.

01:39.757 --> 01:41.691

The 31-year-ol
sous chef from Albany

01:41.759 --> 01:43.460

02:49.340 --> 02:51.018
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:52.385 --> 02:53.111
Goodnight

02:53.121 --> 02:54.685
All:
Goodnight Chef.

03:00.052 --> 03:01.637
Trevor can you come here please.

03:01.837 --> 03:03.511
You know I've dodged the bullet
five times.

03:03.746 --> 03:06.331
Like all I'm asking of everyone
is like a clean slate.

03:06.341 --> 03:07.755
I'm beginning to run out of luck.

03:07.765 --> 03:09.365
We don't  have anything against you, Sabrina

03:09.459 --> 03:11.126
we don't.
Just check the attitude.

03:11.194 --> 03:12.561
I don't think
I have an attitude, man.

03:12.628 --> 03:13.995
You do.
You do.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.297
You do.

03:15.364 --> 03:16.465
The truth hurts, you know?

03:16.532 --> 03:18.333
I have a bad attitude.

03:18.401 --> 03:19.501
You guys are right.
You guys are right.

03:19.569 --> 03:20.669
I'm serious.

03:20.736 --> 03:22.704
I just have to come
in tomorrow

03:22.772 --> 03:25.073
with a new attitude, because
I'm not ready to leave yet.

03:25.141 --> 03:26.708
I'm not gonna have
an attitude anymore.

03:26.776 --> 03:28.176
I promise.

03:28.244 --> 03:30.245
I don't believe
a damn thing Sabrina says!

03:30.313 --> 03:32.247
"Oh, I'm gonna show you
that I'm humble.

03:32.315 --> 03:34.549
"I'm gonna show you
that I won't have an attitude.

03:34.617 --> 03:36.384
I'm hungry."
No, you're a ghetto bitch.

03:36.452 --> 03:39.287
It's time for Sabrina
to go home, bad.

03:42.658 --> 03:46.428
Chef hates me.
He [Bleep] Hates me.

03:46.496 --> 03:48.330
There's no way any of us
can help you with that.

03:48.397 --> 03:49.965
(Boris)
I'm disappointed in myself.

03:50.032 --> 03:51.800
I expected to come here,
kick ass, be a [Bleep] Cowboy.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.168
You know?

03:53.236 --> 03:54.469
I need to make a comeback.

03:54.537 --> 03:56.204
That's my third time tonight.

03:56.272 --> 03:57.973
You skated by by the skin
of your teeth tonight, big boy.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.341
Just got to do this, guys.

03:59.408 --> 04:01.443
Got a couple people
that got [Bleep] To prove

04:01.511 --> 04:03.211
<i>and, you know, just got</i>
<i>to keep moving forward.</i>

04:03.279 --> 04:05.413
Boris is on his last string,

04:05.481 --> 04:07.449
so we've been carrying him
for about the last week.

04:07.517 --> 04:08.884
You know, I'm not gonna do
it anymore.

04:08.951 --> 04:11.720
It's just unbelievable.

04:11.787 --> 04:14.156
(Announcer)
It's been a rough night
for Sabrina and Boris,

04:14.223 --> 04:17.826
but as a new day begins,
they know it's a new opportunity

04:17.894 --> 04:19.661
to fight back
and show chef Ramsay

04:19.728 --> 04:21.829
what they're made of.

04:21.898 --> 04:23.498
Let's go!

04:23.566 --> 04:24.900
Holy [Bleep].
Oh, [Bleep].

04:24.967 --> 04:27.636
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

04:27.703 --> 04:31.606
I see this covered table
with this black sheet over it,

04:31.674 --> 04:35.844
and I'm like, "I wonder
if that is a corpse."

04:35.912 --> 04:37.312
Right, good morning.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.914
(All)
Morning, chef.

04:38.981 --> 04:40.415
Okay, as you know,
great chefs

04:40.483 --> 04:42.350
are imaginative, yeah?

04:42.418 --> 04:43.952
<i>Have to think fast</i>
<i>on their feet.</i>

04:44.020 --> 04:46.121
They understand
the combination,

04:46.189 --> 04:47.822
the executions,
and the marriage

04:47.890 --> 04:50.759
of ingredients instantly.

04:50.826 --> 04:52.561
And they're willing
to gamble, yes?

04:52.628 --> 04:53.895
(All)
Yes, chef.

04:53.963 --> 04:57.766
Which brings us
to our next challenge.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.668
Yes.

04:59.735 --> 05:01.469
[Laughter]

05:01.537 --> 05:03.538
Especially made
for <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

05:03.606 --> 05:05.807
It's roulette. It's roulette.
[laughs] So excited.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.643
I love roulette.
Oh, I love roulette.

05:08.711 --> 05:09.711
So much fun.

05:09.779 --> 05:11.179
<i>Listen to me.</i>

05:11.247 --> 05:13.114
There are 18 different letters
on the wheel.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.716
<i>Each of you</i>
<i>will spin the wheel.</i>

05:14.784 --> 05:17.319
Every time you land
on the letter,

05:17.386 --> 05:19.387
you have ten seconds
to come up with an ingredient

05:19.455 --> 05:20.789
<i>beginning with that letter.</i>

05:20.856 --> 05:22.757
<i>And then each team comes up</i>

05:22.825 --> 05:26.928
with one stunning dish
using your chosen

05:26.996 --> 05:28.096
five ingredients.

05:28.164 --> 05:29.664
<i>Obviously, gentlemen,</i>

05:29.732 --> 05:30.999
there's four of you
in the blue team.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.334
Vinny, you'll spin twice.

05:32.401 --> 05:33.868
Yes, chef.

05:33.936 --> 05:35.537
Everyone ready to begin?
(All)
Yes, chef.

05:35.605 --> 05:36.871
Let's go.
Blue team first. Let's go.

05:36.939 --> 05:38.473
(Announcer)
In this challenge,

05:38.541 --> 05:39.541
each chef will choose
one ingredient

05:39.609 --> 05:40.842
based on a spin
of the wheel.

05:40.910 --> 05:41.910
<i>Right.</i>

05:41.978 --> 05:43.411
Are you ready?
I'm ready.

05:43.479 --> 05:44.546
(Announcer)
Vinny is leading off

05:44.614 --> 05:45.981
and it's important
that he selects

05:46.048 --> 05:48.817
an ingredient that his team
can build on.

05:48.884 --> 05:51.720
And you go "k."

05:51.787 --> 05:52.721
Ten seconds.

05:52.788 --> 05:54.956
Okay.

05:55.024 --> 05:56.758
Uh...

05:56.826 --> 05:57.926
Five.

05:57.994 --> 05:59.194
<i>Four.</i>
Kale.

05:59.262 --> 06:00.795
Kale.

06:00.863 --> 06:02.497
Vinny's [Bleep] Fast
on his feet.

06:02.565 --> 06:05.934
Boom, boom, boom--
kale, yes, excellent.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.403
Back around.

06:08.471 --> 06:10.672
<i>Come on, vin.</i>

06:10.740 --> 06:12.274
"Y."

06:12.341 --> 06:13.408
Ten seconds from now.

06:13.476 --> 06:15.143
Uh...

06:15.211 --> 06:16.144
Ah!

06:16.212 --> 06:17.479
Yams.

06:17.546 --> 06:18.346
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Yams?</i>

06:18.414 --> 06:20.482
<i>Boris.</i>

06:20.549 --> 06:21.583
Let's go, Boris.

06:21.651 --> 06:23.285
"M."

06:23.352 --> 06:24.319
<i>Ten seconds from now.</i>

06:24.387 --> 06:26.121
Miso.

06:26.188 --> 06:27.989
Miso?
[laughter]

06:28.057 --> 06:29.991
When Boris said, "miso,"
I just looked

06:30.059 --> 06:32.160
at the rest of the team,
and they were just like,

06:32.228 --> 06:34.195
"oh, my God."

06:34.263 --> 06:35.463
Miso?
Miso.

06:35.531 --> 06:36.598
Yeah, we really
didn't need miso.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.133
It's hard to work with.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.601
It's hard to get it right.

06:39.669 --> 06:41.369
Okay, miso.
Miso.

06:41.437 --> 06:43.672
Brr.
Okay.

06:43.739 --> 06:45.440
Rob.
(Announcer)
After three spins,

06:45.508 --> 06:47.142
the men have two unusual
vegetables...

06:47.209 --> 06:49.144
We're working
with kale, yam...

06:49.211 --> 06:50.312
(Announcer)
And one asian seasoning.

06:50.379 --> 06:51.680
And miso.

06:51.747 --> 06:53.148
Yes, we are.

06:53.215 --> 06:55.050
(Announcer)
And with only two spins left,

06:55.117 --> 06:56.451
they desperately need
a main ingredient.

06:56.519 --> 06:57.719
We don't have anything.

06:57.787 --> 06:59.354
We'vaccomplished zero here.

06:59.422 --> 07:01.089
Spin the ball, big boy.
Let's go.

07:01.157 --> 07:02.657
It's all on my bacing good.

07:02.725 --> 07:04.926
Here we go.

Striped bass?

07:11.801 --> 07:14.002
Boom--striped bass,

07:14.070 --> 07:15.070
Good. Nice one.

07:15.137 --> 07:16.571
Good choice.

07:16.639 --> 07:19.741
Off you go.

07:19.809 --> 07:22.077
And you're "a."

07:22.144 --> 07:23.345
Asparagus.

07:23.412 --> 07:24.713
<i>Asparagus?</i>

07:24.780 --> 07:25.680
<i>Okay, good.</i>

07:29.318 --> 07:30.618
And...

07:30.686 --> 07:31.886
<i>That's what</i>
<i>you're working with.</i>

07:31.954 --> 07:33.355
Back in line.

07:33.422 --> 07:35.023
(Announcer)
The blue team has completed

07:35.091 --> 07:36.458
the selection phase
of the challenge.

07:36.525 --> 07:38.093
Okay.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.894
(Announcer)
And now it's time
for the red team

07:39.962 --> 07:40.428
to have their spin
at the wheel.

07:40.496 --> 07:43.598
Off you go.

07:43.666 --> 07:44.566
Whoa.
"R."

07:44.633 --> 07:47.569
<i>Ten seconds from now.</i>

07:47.636 --> 07:49.504
Come on, Trev.
Come on, Trevor.

07:49.572 --> 07:50.772
"R."
So easy.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.340
And immediately
I think radicchio,

07:52.408 --> 07:55.744
raspberry, roast beef,
radishes,

07:55.811 --> 07:57.545
red peppers, ravioli,
rib eye,

07:57.613 --> 07:59.047
ricotta, refried beans,
risotto,

07:59.115 --> 08:00.882
e, rhubarb, ribs, rice.

08:00.950 --> 08:01.816
Ingredient, please.

08:01.884 --> 08:02.851
Rutabaga.

08:02.918 --> 08:03.852
<i>Rutabaga?</i>

08:03.919 --> 08:04.986
Rutabaga?

08:05.054 --> 08:07.088
Really, Trevor?
Adventurous.

08:07.156 --> 08:09.157
(Announcer)
After wrestling with his "r"s,

08:09.225 --> 08:11.826
Trev's radical roulette result
is the random root...

08:11.894 --> 08:13.461
Rutabaga.

08:13.529 --> 08:14.963
<i>Where the [Bleep] That</i>
<i>one came from, I don't know.</i>

08:15.030 --> 08:16.264
Off you go, Jillian.

08:16.332 --> 08:17.832
(Announcer)
Next up is Jillian...

08:17.900 --> 08:19.134
<i>Make it count.</i>

08:19.201 --> 08:20.468
(Announcer)
And she chooses...

08:20.536 --> 08:21.469
"C."
Ten seconds from now.

08:21.537 --> 08:22.871
Cauliflower.

08:22.938 --> 08:24.339
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Cauliflower.</i>

08:24.407 --> 08:27.041
(Announcer)
While Sabrina picks...

08:27.109 --> 08:28.910
Um, bok choy.

08:28.978 --> 08:30.145
Bok choy.

08:30.212 --> 08:32.447
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Rutabaga, cauliflower,</i>

08:32.515 --> 08:34.749
bok choy.
[bleep] Me.

08:34.817 --> 08:36.116
We might be.

08:36.184 --> 08:39.421
<i>Gail, good luck</i>
<i>on that one.</i>

08:39.488 --> 08:42.424
Ten seconds with "f."

08:42.491 --> 08:43.591
[Sighs]

08:43.659 --> 08:45.226
We really need a core

08:45.294 --> 08:46.961
for this dish right now.

08:47.029 --> 08:49.197
Fennel, chef.

08:49.265 --> 08:50.765
Fennel?

08:50.833 --> 08:52.367
"Fennel" comes flying
out of her mouth

08:52.435 --> 08:53.601
and I'm scared right now.

08:53.669 --> 08:55.837
Abt what you have...

08:55.905 --> 08:57.372
And...

08:57.440 --> 08:59.841
What the hell are we gonna
do with these ingredients?

08:59.909 --> 09:03.111
Like, we can make some crazy
weird soup or something.

09:03.179 --> 09:04.679
This is getting scary.

09:04.747 --> 09:06.114
Start thinking
about that main ingredient.

09:06.182 --> 09:07.682
Off you go.
Come on, Nona.

09:07.750 --> 09:13.388
You got to get us
a protein, girl.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.490
<i>"S."</i>
<i>Ten seconds from now.</i>

09:18.928 --> 09:20.161
Salmon.

09:20.229 --> 09:21.095
Salmon.
Boom.

09:21.163 --> 09:22.397
My girl Nona nails it.

09:22.465 --> 09:23.498
Now we got a protein.

09:23.566 --> 09:26.167
We can make this work.

09:26.235 --> 09:27.836
Well done.
Thank God for that.

09:27.903 --> 09:29.971
<i>Okay, everybody ready</i>
<i>to begin cooking?</i>

09:30.039 --> 09:32.307
(All)
Yes, chef.
Yes?

09:32.374 --> 09:34.642
30 minutes starting from now.
Off you go.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.511
(Announcer)
The teams have only 30 minutes
to figure out

09:36.579 --> 09:38.179
the best way to combine
their ingredients

09:38.247 --> 09:40.482
and make a spectacular entree.

09:40.549 --> 09:41.850
I think we should do
a cauliflower puree.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.117
<i>Rutabaga chips.</i>

09:43.185 --> 09:44.786
I came up
with the goofy thing rutabaga,

09:44.854 --> 09:46.254
so it was up to me
to come up with options.

09:46.322 --> 09:47.889
<i>Ps.</i>

09:47.957 --> 09:49.390
I just got to get
the seasoning right on those.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.558
Yeah.
<i>Good. That's good.</i>

09:50.626 --> 09:51.659
I don't know how to work
with miso.

09:51.727 --> 09:52.961
I know how to work
with miso.

09:53.028 --> 09:54.496
I picked miso.
I will stand by miso.

09:54.563 --> 09:56.798
I take the responsibility
of doing the miso myself.

09:56.866 --> 09:58.733
I think we're there, okay?
I think we're there.

09:58.801 --> 10:00.635
At this point in time,
it's do or die.

10:00.703 --> 10:02.270
Aprons--
aprons coming your way.

10:02.338 --> 10:04.205
Okay, guys, I got the miso.

10:04.273 --> 10:05.306
Get it working, though, if
you're gonna get a broth going.

10:05.374 --> 10:06.975
Get it working.

10:07.042 --> 10:09.077
Miso is kind of one of those
things that's on the fence.

10:09.144 --> 10:11.012
We're gonna have
to have Boris work with it

10:11.080 --> 10:11.946
and have him kill it,
because if he doesn't,

10:12.014 --> 10:12.914
we're gonna go down.

10:12.982 --> 10:13.848
Are you confident in that?

10:13.916 --> 10:14.916
Yes.

10:14.984 --> 10:16.584
<i>I would not have chosen it</i>

10:16.652 --> 10:18.553
if I didn't know
what to do with it.

10:18.621 --> 10:20.989
Or that you didn't know
what else to do with an "m."

10:21.056 --> 10:23.291
Guys have no [Bleep]
Confidence in me.

10:23.359 --> 10:24.726
That really [Bleep] Hurts.

10:24.793 --> 10:26.194
If they don't have faith
in me,

10:26.262 --> 10:27.529
that's one thing,
but I have faith in myself.

10:27.596 --> 10:28.930
I don't give a [Bleep]
What you think.

10:28.998 --> 10:30.265
I will make this [Bleep] Work.

10:30.332 --> 10:31.733
Taste it.
How does that taste?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.201
Tastes pretty good.

10:33.269 --> 10:34.269
Okay.
Well, thank you.

10:34.336 --> 10:35.303
I nailed it.

10:35.371 --> 10:36.404
This is what I do.

10:36.472 --> 10:37.939
Trust me when I tell you

10:38.007 --> 10:39.073
this is a man
who knows his miso.

10:39.141 --> 10:40.575
It works.

10:40.643 --> 10:42.644
This miso broth,
it's growing on me real fast.

10:42.711 --> 10:45.046
I'm thinking it's gonna be
pretty hot this dish now.

10:45.114 --> 10:47.949
(Announcer)
Boris' miso has won
the blue team over.

10:48.017 --> 10:49.517
Yeah, it tastes nice.

10:49.585 --> 10:50.718
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen,

10:50.786 --> 10:52.453
the verdict is still out...

10:52.521 --> 10:54.222
So how are those chips?
(Announcer)
On Trev's rutabaga.

10:54.290 --> 10:55.790
Taste 'em.

10:55.858 --> 10:58.026
I've never really cooked
rutabaga chips before.

10:58.093 --> 11:00.261
I really wasn't sure what
was gonna work and what wasn't.

11:00.329 --> 11:02.063
<i>Tastes burnt.</i>

11:02.131 --> 11:04.032
The chips were burnt
and bitter, and I'm like,

11:04.099 --> 11:05.800
"mm, mm-mm.
Chef's not gonna accept that."

11:05.868 --> 11:08.202
I think this
is gonna be fine.

11:08.270 --> 11:10.538
(Announcer)
Trev has managed to impress
one person with his rutabaga...

11:10.606 --> 11:11.906
Tastes good.

11:11.974 --> 11:12.907
(Announcer)
Himself.

11:12.975 --> 11:14.442
No, no, no, no, no.

11:14.510 --> 11:16.044
(Announcer)
But he's not the only one

11:16.111 --> 11:17.645
who's impressed
with his own cooking.

11:17.713 --> 11:20.815
Working with yam and asparagus
is simple--

11:20.883 --> 11:22.317
simple, simple, simple.

11:22.384 --> 11:24.152
What else do you have
in there?

11:24.219 --> 11:25.787
All I'm goa do is just blanch
these off--that's it.

11:25.854 --> 11:27.655
I just don't know
if we're going

11:27.723 --> 11:29.424
in the right direction
with the yams and the asparagus.

11:29.491 --> 11:30.592
Wow, dude, seriously?

11:30.659 --> 11:31.893
It seemed simple and plain

11:33.762 --> 11:35.396
put some cilantro
in there too.

11:35.464 --> 11:37.198
But I can't do everything
by myself.

11:37.266 --> 11:38.666
You know what
you could do?

11:38.734 --> 11:39.801
Is you could get
some coriander

11:39.868 --> 11:40.969
to tie in the [Bleep]
Cilantro.

11:41.036 --> 11:43.871
I don't think we should.
Fine, don't do it.

11:43.939 --> 11:46.407
Five minutes to go!

11:46.475 --> 11:49.043
You guys want to taste
the puree?

11:49.111 --> 11:51.412
More butter, more salt.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.915
The cauliflower puree
was giving me a hard time.

11:53.983 --> 11:55.383
We can get it creamier,
though, can't we?

11:55.451 --> 11:56.684
It's not looking good.

11:56.752 --> 11:58.353
Can't get it
any more creamier.

11:58.420 --> 11:59.554
It's all right.
Just use lots of butter.

11:59.622 --> 12:01.322
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.324
I'm gonna do everything I can
and make it work,

12:03.392 --> 12:05.960
'cause if not,
then we're [Bleep].

12:06.028 --> 12:07.061
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:07.129 --> 12:08.229
Mmm!

12:08.297 --> 12:10.031
Okay, it's [Bleep] Creamy.

12:10.099 --> 12:11.099
Good.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.233
Last minute to go!

12:12.301 --> 12:13.134
(All)
Yes, chef.

12:13.202 --> 12:14.302
Here we go.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.770
Let's go!
Start plating!

12:15.838 --> 12:17.739
Let's bring it
together, guys.

12:17.806 --> 12:19.741
Fennel sauce is done.
Fennel is done.
Okay, hold on.

12:19.808 --> 12:20.942
Where we going?
Right here on top
of the bok.

12:21.010 --> 12:22.243
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:22.311 --> 12:23.645
Yo, grab the Fleur de sel
real quick.

12:23.712 --> 12:24.479
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

12:24.546 --> 12:25.847
Come on, cgo, go, go, go.

12:25.914 --> 12:27.015
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Eight, seven...</i>

12:27.082 --> 12:28.149
There's no Fleur de sel.
Yes, there is.

12:28.217 --> 12:28.850
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Six, five...</i>

12:28.917 --> 12:30.118
Do not go back there!

12:30.185 --> 12:31.085
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Four, three...</i>

12:31.153 --> 12:32.520
Put the plate up.

12:32.588 --> 12:35.423
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Two, one, and stop.</i>

12:39.286 --> 12:42.255
Let's go, guys.

12:42.323 --> 12:43.790
Each team had to turn

12:43.858 --> 12:46.126
their five individually
selected ingredients

12:46.193 --> 12:48.027
into one stunning dish.

12:48.095 --> 12:49.829
Okay, let's start off with
the red team first, shall we?

12:49.897 --> 12:51.664
Sabrina, bring
the dish forward, please.

12:51.732 --> 12:54.501
Thank you.
Wow.

12:54.568 --> 12:56.636
(Announcer)
The red am has made
a grilled-salmon dish

12:56.704 --> 12:59.773
in a cauliflower puree
with baby bok choy,

12:59.840 --> 13:03.009
pan-roasted fennel,
and rutabaga chips.

13:03.077 --> 13:04.477
<i>Salmon is cooked perfectly.</i>

13:04.545 --> 13:05.311
Pink.
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

13:05.379 --> 13:06.546
Yes, chef.

13:06.614 --> 13:09.115
The fennel's delicious.
It's nice.

13:09.183 --> 13:11.284
Unfortunately,
the cauliflower puree split.

13:11.352 --> 13:13.253
It's almost like you've had
too much butter in there.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.687
I dropped in whole butter.

13:14.755 --> 13:16.055
What a shame.
It tastes nice,

13:16.123 --> 13:18.158
but it looks like [Bleep].
Okay.

13:18.225 --> 13:19.626
Come on, Nona.

13:19.693 --> 13:21.060
To [Bleep] Something up
like that is, like,

13:21.128 --> 13:22.529
such a rookie mistake.

13:22.596 --> 13:24.697
The chips, who did that?

13:24.765 --> 13:26.499
I did, chef.

13:26.567 --> 13:28.768
Bitter!

13:28.836 --> 13:32.439
I'm disappointed with those.

13:32.506 --> 13:34.774
For those [Bleep] Stupid
rutabaga chips.

13:34.842 --> 13:36.476
Right, blue team,
let's go.

13:36.544 --> 13:38.578
(Annncer)
It's now time for the blue team

13:38.646 --> 13:40.280
to present
their pan-seared striped bass

13:40.347 --> 13:41.748
with braised kale,
asparagus,

13:41.816 --> 13:44.784
and fried yams
in a light miso broth.

13:44.852 --> 13:46.920
Presentation--
all that wow factor.

13:46.987 --> 13:48.221
That looks nice.

13:48.289 --> 13:51.324
Like, ours didn't look
that nice.

13:51.392 --> 13:56.696
Fish cooked perfectly.

13:56.764 --> 13:59.065
Miso tasted delicious.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.333
Boris, that was you, yes?
Yes, chef.

14:00.401 --> 14:02.635
Sweet, delicious.

14:02.703 --> 14:04.437
I knew it! I knew it!

14:04.505 --> 14:07.874
That right then and there just
makes everything worth it.

14:07.942 --> 14:09.876
My problem with that dish
is the asparagus and the yams.

14:09.944 --> 14:12.178
<i>It's like it's sort of--</i>

14:12.246 --> 14:14.647
it's lazy 'cause there's
nothing exciting.

14:14.715 --> 14:17.350
Who cooked the asparagus
and the yams?
I did, chef.

14:17.418 --> 14:19.152
This is the chance for you guys
to do something different,

14:19.220 --> 14:20.653
something just with flavor.

14:20.721 --> 14:22.422
So...

14:22.490 --> 14:23.623
Hard, very hard,

14:23.691 --> 14:25.191
'cause there's areas of flair,

14:25.259 --> 14:26.893
but then there's areas
of blandness--

14:26.961 --> 14:29.095
the asparagus and the yam.

14:29.163 --> 14:30.363
<i>I could match that</i>

14:30.431 --> 14:33.032
th thecauliflower.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.101
I don't expect that
at this level, that's all.

14:35.169 --> 14:36.369
[Bleep]

14:36.437 --> 14:37.904
<i>Okay, tough decision--</i>

14:37.972 --> 14:38.972
real tough decision,
because the fish

14:39.039 --> 14:41.474
was cooked perfectly.

14:41.542 --> 14:45.111
The winning team
on a very tough challenge--

14:45.179 --> 14:47.213
cauliflower
that looked a mess,

14:47.281 --> 14:49.749
but it tasted delicious.

14:49.817 --> 14:51.551
The red team, congratulations.

14:51.619 --> 14:53.219
[Cheers and applause]

14:53.287 --> 14:54.888

<i>Well done.</i>

14:57.024 --> 14:59.058
Holy [Bleep]. I can't believe
we just pulled this off.

14:59.126 --> 15:00.793
Thank you, chef.
<i>Red team, well done.</i>

15:00.861 --> 15:02.061
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

15:02.129 --> 15:02.929
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

15:02.997 --> 15:05.598
I'm sending you to a resort

15:05.666 --> 15:08.535
that both Jennifer Lopez
and Elton John

15:11.272 --> 15:14.841
this special place is in Vegas.

15:14.909 --> 15:18.645
[Cheers and applause]

15:18.712 --> 15:22.849
You'll be staying
at the Rio all suites and hotel.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.552
Your suite
is 14,000 square feet.

15:25.619 --> 15:26.953

15:27.021 --> 15:28.254
Head up to the dorms
and start packing.

15:28.322 --> 15:29.455
Let's go.

15:29.523 --> 15:30.523
[Screaming]
Rock on.

15:30.591 --> 15:32.992
We're going to Vegas!

15:33.060 --> 15:34.994
Vegas!

15:35.062 --> 15:37.297
Hey, red team.

15:37.364 --> 15:38.665
Blue team...

15:38.732 --> 15:40.433
<i>On our next dinner service,</i>

15:40.501 --> 15:44.137
<i>we are hosting</i>
<i>an exclusive family night.</i>

15:44.204 --> 15:49.008
Each table will be welcomed
with an assortment of fries.

15:49.076 --> 15:50.476
<i>So, blue team,</i>
<i>for your punishment,</i>

15:50.544 --> 15:52.745
<i>you'll be spending the day</i>

15:52.813 --> 15:55.748
washing, peeling,
cutting, preparing

15:55.816 --> 15:58.284
well over 1,000 potatoes.

15:58.352 --> 16:00.720
Your delivery of potatoes
is actually here,

16:00.788 --> 16:02.855
so head outside.
Let's go.

16:02.923 --> 16:04.457
I'm just pissed about this.

16:04.525 --> 16:05.491
I didn't come
to <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

16:05.559 --> 16:06.926
to cook [Bleep] Potatoes.

16:06.994 --> 16:10.530
Open the door.

16:10.598 --> 16:12.632
[Laughter]

16:12.700 --> 16:15.101
Holy [Bleep].

16:15.169 --> 16:17.070
There's potatoes
everywhere, man.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.938
It's a mess, and guess what--
we got to pick it up.

16:22.943 --> 16:24.744
That is one big truck.

16:24.812 --> 16:26.379
Bye, guys.

16:26.447 --> 16:27.513
Bye, guys.

16:27.581 --> 16:28.748
<i>Bye.</i>

16:28.816 --> 16:30.049
Have fun.

16:30.117 --> 16:32.518
Have fun
peeling potatoes, boys!

16:32.586 --> 16:35.622
We'll be in Vegas!
Whoo!

16:38.926 --> 16:40.860
Hi.
Welcome to southwest.

16:40.928 --> 16:42.228
I'm so excited.

16:42.296 --> 16:44.063
I've never been to Vegas.

16:44.131 --> 16:46.366
I got my hooker boots on,

16:46.433 --> 16:48.768
and I'm gonna have a good time.

16:48.836 --> 16:50.737
Yeah, this
is awesome, man.

16:50.804 --> 16:52.939
(Announcer)
While it seems
like the sky's the limit

16:53.007 --> 16:54.407
for the red team...

16:54.475 --> 16:55.975
There's a lot
of [Bleep] Potatoes.

16:56.043 --> 16:57.377
(Announcer)
It seems like there's no limit

16:57.444 --> 16:58.845
to the blue team's punishment.

16:58.912 --> 17:00.747
Tell me about it.
This is my fifth bust-up.

17:00.814 --> 17:02.749
By the time we're done
with this,

17:02.816 --> 17:04.651
don't we have to cut them all,
you know, for fries and [Bleep]?

17:04.718 --> 17:07.487
We'll probably be here
until dinner service tomorrow,

17:07.554 --> 17:10.056
just because Rob didn't grill
the asparagus.

17:10.124 --> 17:12.525
Thanks, buddy.

17:12.593 --> 17:17.030
I'm tired of this.

17:17.097 --> 17:19.766
(All)
Go, red team!

17:19.833 --> 17:21.768
(Trev)
Vegas--I've never been
here before.

17:21.835 --> 17:23.169
This is the v.I.P. Treatment
I've been waiting for.

17:27.508 --> 17:29.442
Welcome to your suite.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.645
[Gasps]
[bleep].

(Nona)
We open the doors
to palazzo suites,

17:34.648 --> 17:37.684
and it's just
marble tile everywhere...

17:37.751 --> 17:39.085
[Gasps]

17:39.153 --> 17:43.856
Monstrous ice sculptures
with Sushi and lobster

17:43.924 --> 17:45.324
and caviar.

17:45.392 --> 17:46.359
[Plays piano]

17:46.427 --> 17:48.194
[Laughter]

17:48.262 --> 17:49.829
Welcome to the big time!

17:49.897 --> 17:52.565
I have never
in my entire life

17:52.633 --> 17:55.535
seen anything like the suite
that we're in right now.

17:55.602 --> 17:56.903
Oh, there's
a jacuzzi here too!

17:56.970 --> 18:00.606
It is absolutely beautiful--

18:00.674 --> 18:02.475
the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

18:02.543 --> 18:04.210
Lap of luxury.

18:09.016 --> 18:11.718
I'm actually really enjoying
this potato business here.

18:11.785 --> 18:13.352
I'm Russian.
I love the potato.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.388
You could fry.
You could bake it.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.457
You could make potato soup.
You could live on that [Bleep].

18:17.524 --> 18:19.192
I couldn't think
of a better reward

18:19.259 --> 18:21.327
than to peel [Bleep]
30,000 potatoes.

18:21.395 --> 18:22.295
<i>It's great.</i>

18:22.362 --> 18:24.197
Boris does a lot of this

18:24.264 --> 18:25.631
and he does
very little this.

18:25.699 --> 18:27.133
I love it.

18:27.201 --> 18:29.268
If Boris doesn't step up,
he's gonna go home.

18:29.336 --> 18:31.537
I'd rather be doing this
than going to Vegas.

18:31.605 --> 18:33.239
(Announcer)
While the blue team
knows exactly

18:33.307 --> 18:34.674
what they'll be doing
for the next several hours...

Is in for a big surprise.

18:38.712 --> 18:41.314

18:41.381 --> 18:43.182
They're not saying anything.
Hello?

The red team is thoroughly

19:06.206 --> 19:08.739
enjoying their reward
high atop the Vegas strip

19:08.809 --> 19:11.311
in their
14,000-square-foot suite.

19:11.378 --> 19:12.946

Hi.

19:16.150 --> 19:17.450

Even more magical.

19:17.518 --> 19:19.152
We're penn and teller.

19:19.219 --> 19:21.287
Show us around this place.
Is it nice in here?

19:21.355 --> 19:25.425
I'll be damned if it's not
penn and teller in front of me.

19:25.492 --> 19:28.628
Congratulations.
You guys had all won here?

19:28.696 --> 19:29.996
I got penn and teller
in my room.

19:30.064 --> 19:32.131
I'm just in awe.

19:32.199 --> 19:34.434
These two guys
are great magicians.

19:34.501 --> 19:35.668
You want an envelope?
Yes!

19:35.736 --> 19:37.070
And we got gifts.

19:37.137 --> 19:38.805
It was just
the top of all tops.

19:38.872 --> 19:40.607
"You're a winner
at one of Las Vegas' resorts."

19:40.674 --> 19:42.141
Two nights--here.

19:42.209 --> 19:43.309
No way.
What?

19:43.377 --> 19:44.444
Yeah!

19:44.511 --> 19:45.812

Yeah!

Hell, yeah! I'm about to come
back up in here and party.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.787
This is
the "awesomest" reward ever.

19:54.855 --> 19:56.389
It is so cool.

While the red team
parties the night away in Vegas,

20:07.401 --> 20:11.170
back in Hell's Kitchen,
it's all business.

20:11.238 --> 20:12.839
We have to kill
it tomorrow, bro.

20:12.906 --> 20:14.974
We have to carry Boris
tomorrow.

20:15.042 --> 20:16.576
Boris--he's just
out of his league.

20:16.644 --> 20:17.877
If he goes down,
it's gonna drag

20:17.945 --> 20:19.512
the rest of us down with him.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.314
I don't want to lose,
and if we lose,

20:21.382 --> 20:24.283
I know what the reason why
is gonna be.

20:24.351 --> 20:25.852
I ain't going up.
You ain't going up.

20:25.919 --> 20:28.221
So it's gonna be them two.

20:28.288 --> 20:29.656
And they know it.

20:29.723 --> 20:31.524
Not only do ,
Ramsay knows it.

20:31.592 --> 20:34.227
He knows we're the two studs
in this [Bleep] Group.

I won't let him down.

20:36.130 --> 20:39.532
Talk to you in the morning.

(Announcer)
It may be a brand-new day
in Hell's Kitchen,

20:42.069 --> 20:46.205
but the blue team shares
the same old opinion of Boris.

20:46.273 --> 20:47.640
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Boris, what are you doing?</i>

20:47.708 --> 20:49.008
The puree.
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

20:49.076 --> 20:50.376
You're wasting your time.
Work on something else.

20:50.444 --> 20:51.644
[Bleep].

20:51.712 --> 20:53.946
I know where I stand
with my team.

20:54.014 --> 20:57.483
I know that they consider me
a weak link.

20:57.551 --> 21:01.154
Tonight is the night that
I need to make a comeback.

21:01.221 --> 21:03.990
Boris definitely
has a lot to prove.
He needs a miracle.

While the blue team preps
for tonight's dinner service,

from Vegas...

We're gonna go, and we're gonna
[Bleep] Kill it tonight

No, we need to pull it out.

<i>It needs to come out.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

21:29.483 --> 21:30.683
Sabrina said she was gonna

21:30.751 --> 21:32.719
change her attitude,
but her attitude sucks.

21:32.786 --> 21:34.454
I swear to God
if she doesn't set

21:34.521 --> 21:35.888
this [Bleep] Station,
I'm gonna kick her ass.

21:35.956 --> 21:38.124
It's like a joke, man.

21:38.192 --> 21:39.592
I'm so over Sabrina.

Every night in Hell's Kitchen

Tonight is family night.

21:52.573 --> 21:53.706

But tonight,

21:53.774 --> 21:55.208
there's little room for error.

In amongst those diners tonight

21:57.177 --> 22:00.913
will be my family.

to forgive us.

I don't plan
on being embarrassed.

over that leadership position,

to where we need to go.

each table

23:15.455 --> 23:17.557
will receive a welcoming platter
of french fries.

23:17.624 --> 23:19.826
Let's go, Trev. I want
those fries out, guys, yes?

23:19.893 --> 23:20.960
It's right here.
Ready, chef.

23:21.028 --> 23:22.762
It's a kids' menu.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.430
We're cooking
for four-, five-, six-,

23:24.498 --> 23:25.131
seven-, eight-, nine-,
ten-year-olds.

23:25.199 --> 23:27.099
Guys, fries going!

23:27.167 --> 23:28.968
They just want something
that's gonna taste good.

23:29.036 --> 23:30.002
It shouldn't be
that big of a problem.

23:30.070 --> 23:31.804
Coming with the fries!

23:31.872 --> 23:33.606
Fries go straight out,
guys, yes?

23:33.674 --> 23:34.507
(All)
Yes, chef.
Let's go, Rob.

23:34.575 --> 23:36.108
And go.

23:36.176 --> 23:39.245
It was my fault that we lost
the challenge...Evidently.

23:39.313 --> 23:41.447
There's a lot of pressure
on me right now

23:41.515 --> 23:43.115
and I'm gonna fight for my life
tonight. I'm not going down.

23:43.183 --> 23:44.884
Behind.

23:44.952 --> 23:47.253
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Good. Look at that.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>

23:47.321 --> 23:49.121
(Announcer)
Both kitchens had no problem
pushing out the fries.

23:49.189 --> 23:50.423
Whoa.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.757
<i>Very nice.</i>

23:51.825 --> 23:52.792
They're really good.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.126
Gentlemen, standby.

23:54.194 --> 23:55.728
Here we go.
First ticket.

23:55.796 --> 23:57.263
Two risotto.
(All)
Yes, chef.

23:57.331 --> 23:58.531
(Announcer)
Now it's up to Vinny

23:58.599 --> 23:59.932
to deliver
on the appetizer station.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.067
Work it, Vinny, yes?

24:01.134 --> 24:02.735
No problem.

24:02.803 --> 24:05.137
Not one person is of a cook as m

24:05.205 --> 24:06.839
and I'm cool with running apps.
To me, that's a piece of cake.

24:06.907 --> 24:08.341
Hot behind you.

24:08.408 --> 24:10.142
Oh, dear.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.644
How many risotto is that?

24:11.712 --> 24:13.646
Two.
Come here, you.

24:13.714 --> 24:14.947
You're doubling up
on the portions.

24:15.015 --> 24:15.781
I've got enough for four.

24:15.849 --> 24:17.316
You're cooking too much!

24:17.384 --> 24:19.352
Yes, chef.
And it's a pure waste!

24:19.419 --> 24:20.987
All of this just wasted!
Yes, chef.

24:21.054 --> 24:22.955
People that eat fine dining

24:23.023 --> 24:25.625
are not used to getting portions
made for, like, andre the giant.

24:25.692 --> 24:27.460
If I was the owner
of the L.A. market

24:27.527 --> 24:29.362
and you were my best chef,
you're toast!

24:29.429 --> 24:32.598
(Announcer)
While Vinny works to deliver
a little less risotto,

24:32.666 --> 24:33.833
over in the red kitchen...

24:33.901 --> 24:35.701
I got problems with this.

24:35.769 --> 24:38.004
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay is expecting
a little more.

24:38.071 --> 24:39.805
Touch more puree in there.
It's a pea risotto.

24:39.873 --> 24:41.607
Come on,
let's go.

24:41.675 --> 24:44.076
The freaking risotto, man--
that [Bleep] Just hates me.

24:44.144 --> 24:46.445
I just want to kick
the risotto's ass.

24:46.513 --> 24:48.247
Jillian, let's go.
Yes, chef!

24:48.315 --> 24:49.682
See, that's better. I don't want
to see any white rice.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.150
Yes, chef.

24:51.218 --> 24:52.852
Keep it going, Jillian, yes?
Yes, chef.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.387
Good.

24:54.454 --> 24:55.922
(Announcer)
45 minutes
into dinner service...

24:55.989 --> 24:57.423
Thank you.
Thank you.

24:57.491 --> 24:59.025
(Announcer)
And more than half
of the families

24:59.092 --> 25:00.226
have been served
their appetizers.

25:00.294 --> 25:02.128
That one's mine.
It's good.

25:02.195 --> 25:03.496
Excellent.

25:03.563 --> 25:05.531
(Announcer)
And one v.I.P. Table is hoping

25:05.599 --> 25:06.766
their father will make sure
that they get Fed next.

25:06.833 --> 25:08.367
It's your family.

25:08.435 --> 25:09.669
Here we go.

25:09.736 --> 25:10.937
On order, six covers,
table one.

25:11.004 --> 25:12.004
Yes, chef?
Three wings,

25:12.072 --> 25:12.939
one mozzarella,
one risotto,

25:13.006 --> 25:14.073
one truffle salad.

25:14.141 --> 25:15.641
(All)
Yes, chef.

25:15.709 --> 25:17.677
My family.

25:17.744 --> 25:19.879
We better get
this [Bleep] Order right.

25:19.947 --> 25:21.380
Let's go, guys, yes?

25:21.448 --> 25:23.082
Three wings,
one moz is coming, chef.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.084
Vinny, are you ready
on the risotto?

25:25.152 --> 25:27.019
No, no.
Vinny, I need
the [Bleep] Risotto.

25:27.087 --> 25:28.387
What are you doing?

25:28.455 --> 25:30.323
I can't sit there
and, you know,

25:30.390 --> 25:31.924
go like this and have
my risottos magically finish.

25:31.992 --> 25:34.827
Hurry up, Vinny!
We've got to go up now!

25:34.895 --> 25:36.228
Yes, chef.

25:36.296 --> 25:37.897
I grabbed the risotto
I had just sent up

25:37.965 --> 25:39.098
for the previous table.

25:39.166 --> 25:40.599
There's nothing wrong with it.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.335
Yo, I'm going up
for risotto, guys.

25:42.402 --> 25:44.370
That's not fair.
That's old.

25:44.438 --> 25:46.505
Trying to get away.

25:46.573 --> 25:48.941
Hey, bozo,
come here, you.
Yes, chef? What happened?

25:49.009 --> 25:50.943
Yeah, shut your fat
East-coast mouth.
Yes, chef.

25:51.011 --> 25:52.578
This table that
you just sent me

25:52.646 --> 25:56.749
that [Bleep] For
happens to be my family.

25:56.817 --> 25:58.684
Oh, no.
What are you doing?

25:58.752 --> 26:00.086
And even if it's
not my family,

26:00.153 --> 26:01.187
they deserve
a fresh risotto.

26:01.254 --> 26:02.388
Look at me.
Yes, chef.

26:02.456 --> 26:03.889
You dirty little [Bleep].

26:03.957 --> 26:05.191
And if you can't be bothered
to do it,

26:05.258 --> 26:06.058
[bleep] Off up
out of here.

26:06.126 --> 26:08.728
Do you want to go home?

26:14.438 --> 26:16.439
(announcer)
It's family night
at Hell's Kitchen,

26:16.507 --> 26:18.149
and Vinny
has taken a shortcut...

26:18.376 --> 26:19.097
That's old.

26:19.107 --> 26:20.750
with the wrong table.

26:21.078 --> 26:22.913
Dirty little [Bleep].

26:22.980 --> 26:26.983
And this table that you just
sent me that [Bleep] For

26:27.051 --> 26:28.852
whether it's
my family or not,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.453
if your family were here
or your family were here

26:30.521 --> 26:31.922
or your family,
I'd make your family

26:31.989 --> 26:33.823
or your wife, your children

26:33.891 --> 26:36.693
a fresh [Bleeprisotto!

26:36.761 --> 26:39.396
Yeah, that's the [Bleep]
I served five minutes ago.

26:39.463 --> 26:41.264
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Okay, re-fire.</i>
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

26:41.332 --> 26:43.400
Everybody's really happy
apart from your family.

26:43.467 --> 26:44.467
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Apart from my family?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:44.535 --> 26:45.802
Come on, Vinny!
Yes, chef.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.604
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.

26:47.672 --> 26:48.238
I'll fix it.
That's all he wants to hear.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.005
And that's it.

26:49.073 --> 26:50.373
Hot behind, chef.

26:50.441 --> 26:51.374
(Announcer)
Vinny has quickly

26:51.442 --> 26:52.409
made a fresh risotto.

26:52.476 --> 26:54.311
Service, please.
Table one. Pickup.

26:54.378 --> 26:56.146
<i>Tell them it wasn't done</i>
<i>on purpose. Let's go.</i>

26:56.213 --> 26:57.547
(Announcer)
And chef Ramsay's wife, tana...

26:57.615 --> 26:58.682
Lovely, thank you.

26:58.749 --> 27:00.350
(Announcer)
And their four kids,

27:00.418 --> 27:03.453
Megan, matilda, Holly, and Jack,
are enjoying their appetizers.

27:03.521 --> 27:05.288
Yummy.

27:05.356 --> 27:07.023
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

27:07.091 --> 27:07.958
Standby.
Our first entree.

27:08.025 --> 27:09.693
Two beef.
Yes, chef.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.594
(Announcer)
Sabrina is being assisted...

27:11.662 --> 27:12.929
Hey, Trev, you want
to give my beef a feel--

27:12.997 --> 27:14.364
(announcer)
By a less-than-thrilled Trev

27:14.432 --> 27:16.166
on the meat station.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.101
Let me know how much longer
I need to put it in there for.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.203
Sabrina is just a Thorn
in my side.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.905
I have no idea
what's going on

27:21.973 --> 27:23.640
in [Bleep] That blonde
little head of hers.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.175
Yeah,
a little bit longer.

27:25.242 --> 27:26.409
See what they say.
Let it rest?

27:26.477 --> 27:28.044
How long, Trev?

27:28.112 --> 27:30.113
She wasn't confident enough
in her own station,

27:30.181 --> 27:32.615
in her own cooking ability
to just send the food.

27:32.683 --> 27:34.584
Get it in the window.
<i>Got it, Trev!</i>

27:34.652 --> 27:36.353
Hot, hot, hot, hot.
Behind, behind, behind, behind.

27:36.420 --> 27:37.821
Good.
Look at that.

27:37.888 --> 27:38.989
Perfectly cooked.
Yes, chef.

27:39.056 --> 27:40.924
Oh, thank God!

27:40.992 --> 27:43.626
I knew that I can cook meat,
and I can cook it well.

27:43.694 --> 27:45.061
(Announcer)
Trev's hard work
on the meat station

27:45.129 --> 27:46.029
has paid off...

27:47.698 --> 27:49.065
Yes, chef!

27:49.133 --> 27:51.001
(Announcer)
For Sabrina.
Great.

27:51.068 --> 27:52.402
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,
back in the blue kitchen,

27:52.470 --> 27:54.237
chef Ramsay asks
that eternal question.

27:54.305 --> 27:57.974
Where's the beef, Boris?

27:58.042 --> 28:01.277
And you're sweating
like a pig.

28:01.345 --> 28:04.447
Slicing the meat right now.

28:04.515 --> 28:07.117
Wipe down your board,
you dirty [Bleep].

28:07.184 --> 28:08.585
You've cooked that
perfectly,

28:08.652 --> 28:09.619
and you're about to slice
on that.

28:09.687 --> 28:10.954
Disgusting!

28:11.022 --> 28:13.423
Y, chef.
Oh, [Bleep].

28:13.491 --> 28:15.158
There you go, Boris.
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

28:15.226 --> 28:16.192
There you go.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.594
Boris is a pig.

28:17.661 --> 28:19.295
He's a Russian [Bleep] Pig.

28:19.363 --> 28:20.597
There you go.
I'm sorry, chef.

28:20.664 --> 28:22.198
It will not happen again.

28:22.266 --> 28:23.099
I was just trying
to get the food out

28:23.167 --> 28:24.567
in a timely manner.

28:24.635 --> 28:25.769
[Sighs deeply]

28:25.836 --> 28:27.203
Beef!
Here's the beef, chef.

28:27.271 --> 28:28.671
Service, please.

28:28.739 --> 28:30.540
(Announcer)
While Boris takes a moment

28:30.608 --> 28:32.342
to clean up his act,
in the red kitchen...

28:32.410 --> 28:33.877
Sabrina, where's the beef?

28:33.944 --> 28:34.744
Right here, chef.
I'm cutting the beef.

28:34.812 --> 28:36.046
That's it, chef.

28:36.113 --> 28:37.847
(Announcer)
Sabra has her act together.

28:37.915 --> 28:39.416
Don't cut that meat.
I'm a minute out.

28:39.483 --> 28:40.950
(Announcer)
Unfortunately,

28:41.018 --> 28:42.986
Nona, on the garnish station,
doesn't.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.354
Oh, come on.

28:44.422 --> 28:45.755
<i>Nona, I need you.</i>

28:45.823 --> 28:47.223
I need you like
there's no tomorrow.

28:47.291 --> 28:48.625
Okay.
Speed up!

28:48.692 --> 28:50.493
Garnish is hard.

28:50.561 --> 28:52.062
I am [Bleep] Dying.

28:52.129 --> 28:53.063
Here you go.
Here's the beef.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.230
Polenta fries.

28:54.298 --> 28:56.933
Garnish! Garnish! Garnish!
Hang on.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.202
If I have to drag these bitches
kicking and screaming

28:59.270 --> 29:01.237
through service and get us done
and work as a team,

29:01.305 --> 29:02.539
I'm gonna [Bleep] Do it.

29:02.606 --> 29:03.907
Nona, I need it now!

29:03.974 --> 29:05.308
Just give me a time!

29:05.376 --> 29:06.709
15 seconds.
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:06.777 --> 29:08.044
It's like you've gone
to the toilet.

29:08.112 --> 29:11.414
Ten, nine, eight,
seven,

29:11.482 --> 29:12.582
six...

29:12.650 --> 29:14.784
You're [Bleep]
Crowding me, dude.

29:14.852 --> 29:15.785
Back up.

29:15.853 --> 29:17.687
Three, two, one.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.889
Give 'em to me.
Here we go.

29:19.957 --> 29:21.224
Polenta fries.
Yeah, yeah.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.525
<i>Go.</i>
There it is.

29:22.593 --> 29:24.494
(Announcer)
Unable to solely count on Nona,

29:24.562 --> 29:26.062
Trev helps push out
the garnish.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.197
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

29:27.264 --> 29:28.998
It's my family's order--

29:29.066 --> 29:30.834
one salmon, one beef,
one macaroni and cheese,

29:30.901 --> 29:32.635
one bolognese, two burgers.

29:32.703 --> 29:34.337
Let's go, guys.
Let's make it happen.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.072
(Announcer)
The men are scrambling

29:36.140 --> 29:38.174
to get entrees out
to chef Ramsay's family.

29:38.242 --> 29:39.843
Chef, I'm coming up
with the salmon.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.311
Two beef coming up
to the pass.

29:41.378 --> 29:42.412
Two burgers.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.713
One bolognese up.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.782
Where's
the macaroni, please?

29:45.850 --> 29:48.118
All right, I'm a little
behind right now on garnish.
Oh, come on.

29:48.185 --> 29:50.820
I am in the weeds so high,
I don't know which way is up.

29:50.888 --> 29:52.422
[Sighs]

29:52.490 --> 29:54.491
When are we gonna get a little
help on this garnish, man?

29:54.558 --> 29:56.459
<i>As soon as I can breathe.</i>

29:56.527 --> 29:58.628
Russell claims he was in the
weeds and couldn't get to me.

29:58.696 --> 30:00.130
What did Russ do--

30:00.197 --> 30:01.898
a few chicken fingers
and two burgers?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.399
[Bleep] That. How dare
he not slide to help me?

30:03.467 --> 30:04.667
I'm pissed.

30:04.735 --> 30:06.769
I'm behind,
and we're gonna be [Bleep]

30:06.837 --> 30:08.738
Omeone doesn't jump
<i>with me here.</i>

30:08.806 --> 30:10.306
I don't know where
he got off thinking

30:10.374 --> 30:11.741
that we were gonna be
his bitch tonight,

30:11.809 --> 30:13.209
but that was definitely
not my role.

30:13.277 --> 30:14.544
I'm here to do my job.

30:14.612 --> 30:15.812
I'm not here to babysit you.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.514
Ah!
[bleep]

30:17.581 --> 30:19.516
(Announcer)
While Rob flies solo
on garnish,

30:19.583 --> 30:22.018
over in the red kitchen...
Where's the chicken?

30:22.086 --> 30:24.287
Six minutes.
(Announcer)
Sabrina on meat...

30:24.355 --> 30:26.422
What's this for?
(Announcer)
Has Trev...

30:26.490 --> 30:28.224
<i>(Sabrina)</i>
<i>It's for the next order.</i>

30:28.292 --> 30:29.526
I had to keep on and on
and on her about times.

30:29.593 --> 30:31.861
The chicken
takes six minutes,

30:31.929 --> 30:33.830
and a grilled cheese
takes two minutes, tops.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.765
Why would you start it
just to let it sit there?

30:35.833 --> 30:37.567
Grilled cheese
only takes two minutes.

30:37.635 --> 30:39.769
I know.
I'm just getting it hot, Trevor.

30:39.837 --> 30:41.037
<i>Slowly--you got to--</i>

30:41.105 --> 30:42.238
it's <i>a la minute.</i>

30:42.306 --> 30:44.007
I know
what I'm doing, Trevor.

30:44.074 --> 30:45.708
<i>Can you stop giving me</i>
<i>an attitude, dude?</i>

30:45.776 --> 30:47.076
I know what I'm doing.
Thank you.

30:47.144 --> 30:49.078
"I know what I'm doing,
and you don't need to

30:49.146 --> 30:50.914
da-da-da-da-da-da-da,"
and I'm like, "whoa."

30:50.981 --> 30:53.416
I'm not giving the attitude.

30:53.484 --> 30:55.919
<i>I'm trying to speed</i>
<i>this up and get it up...</i>
That's fine, Trevor.

30:55.986 --> 30:56.619
<i>But if it's [Bleep] Cold,</i>
<i>it's gonna be horrible.</i>

30:56.687 --> 30:58.121
Sabrina, knock it off!

30:59.823 --> 31:00.957
<i>Shut up!</i>

31:01.025 --> 31:02.592
I'm running the show tonight.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.460
Shut your [Bleep] Mouth.

31:04.528 --> 31:06.329
Give me when I ask it and do
what you're [Bleep] Told.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.597
Quit it right now.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.432
He's a maniac, honestly,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.267
and, like,
not in a good way.

31:11.335 --> 31:12.669
Two chicken, where are they?

31:12.736 --> 31:14.237
Come on!
Push this out!

31:14.305 --> 31:15.205
Check that chicken!
Check this chicken, Trev!

31:15.272 --> 31:18.074
Yeah, go with it.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.776
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Here's that chicken, chef.

31:19.843 --> 31:21.344
Look.
That's raw.

31:21.412 --> 31:24.280
<i>Sabrina!</i>

31:24.348 --> 31:30.653
Trevor, if you don't know
what you're talking about,

31:30.721 --> 31:31.487
<i>(gordon)</i>
<i>Hurry up!</i>

31:31.555 --> 31:32.655
I can't drag these tables

31:32.723 --> 31:33.756
with children
in the dining room.

31:33.824 --> 31:35.291
<i>Let's go!</i>

31:35.359 --> 31:37.460
(Announcerina must ruh
to re-fire her chicken,

31:37.528 --> 31:39.929
because out
in the dining room...

31:39.997 --> 31:42.198
These customers are not
very good at waiting.

31:42.266 --> 31:45.568
I'm hungry.

31:45.636 --> 31:47.036
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

31:47.104 --> 31:49.038
Come on, Rob.

31:49.106 --> 31:51.407
(Announcer)
All the men need to complete
the Ramsay family table

31:51.475 --> 31:52.942
is Rob's macaroni and cheese.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.944
Vinny, get your ass
over here.

31:55.012 --> 31:56.846
<i>He's weeded.</i>
<i>He's weeded bad.</i>

31:56.914 --> 31:58.114
What do you need?
<i>Two macaronis!</i>

31:58.182 --> 31:59.549
<i>Get him two macaronis.</i>

31:59.617 --> 32:03.486
Let's go!

32:03.554 --> 32:05.488
It doesn't matter. Now you do,
so don't put up dog [Bleep].

32:05.556 --> 32:08.424
So if he's not ready,
then [Bleep] Him!

32:08.492 --> 32:10.226
I'll send it separate, okay?

32:10.294 --> 32:12.729
Service, please.

32:12.796 --> 32:15.331
Come on, guys.Together.

32:15.399 --> 32:17.166
In England, we eat
at the same [Bleep] Time.

32:22.373 --> 32:23.573
Come on, Rob.

32:23.641 --> 32:25.441
<i>It's my family.</i>

32:25.509 --> 32:28.177
My son's still waiting
for the macaroni and cheese.

32:28.245 --> 32:29.846
Now I'm worried now.
Here we go again.

32:29.913 --> 32:32.448
Dinner service
is going horrible.

32:32.516 --> 32:33.583
[Bleep] You.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.451
Rob, come on!
Come on!

32:35.519 --> 32:37.453
Rob, move your ass!
Hurry up!

32:45.227 --> 32:47.094
(Announcer)
Two hours into dinner service,

32:47.162 --> 32:48.996
and almost everyone
in the Ramsay family

32:49.064 --> 32:51.799
has their entree.

32:51.867 --> 32:54.835
My son's still waiting
for the macaroni and cheese.

32:54.903 --> 32:57.471
In England,
we eat at the same time.

32:57.539 --> 32:59.140
(Russell)
It's Mac and cheese, bro.

32:59.207 --> 33:01.542
It's not steak.
It's not chicken.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.377
It's easy.
Come on, Rob.

33:03.445 --> 33:04.612
Yes, chef.

33:04.679 --> 33:05.813
Service.

33:05.881 --> 33:07.148
(Announcer)
Rob has finally

33:07.215 --> 33:09.917
completed the Ramsay's table.

33:09.985 --> 33:11.552
And in the red kitchen...

33:11.620 --> 33:13.187
Here's your chicken.
This is hot, okay?

33:13.255 --> 33:14.922
(Announcer)
Sabrina and Trev have put

33:14.990 --> 33:17.425
their differences aside long
enough to entrees.

33:17.492 --> 33:19.527
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

33:19.594 --> 33:22.296
(Announcer)
Now both teams work to complete
their final tickets.

33:22.364 --> 33:24.131
Push this out, guys.
We're gonna fight back.

33:24.199 --> 33:27.401
Service, please.
Go, please.

33:27.469 --> 33:29.503
We got our groove on.
We got our sync on.

33:29.571 --> 33:30.371
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Delicious, delicious,</i>
<i>delicious.</i>

33:30.439 --> 33:31.806
Working, working, working.

33:31.873 --> 33:32.907
We start hustling,
and we're going.

33:32.974 --> 33:34.575
We're banging away.

33:34.643 --> 33:36.977
Hot behind.
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>

33:37.045 --> 33:38.813
Keep it going.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.381
We started rough...

33:40.449 --> 33:42.016
Gail, this speed
and accuracy is amazing.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.484
<i>Keep it up.</i>
Yes, chef.

33:43.552 --> 33:45.386
But we finished strong.
Last table.

33:45.454 --> 33:47.521
<i>(Gail)</i>
<i>One milkshake,</i>
<i>one chocolate cake.</i>

33:47.589 --> 33:50.524
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

33:50.592 --> 33:52.226
It's the best thing
in the whole wide world?

33:52.294 --> 33:53.427
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Good.</i>

33:53.495 --> 33:57.164
Switch off.
Clear down.

33:57.232 --> 33:59.934
Let's get through this
very quickly, yes?

34:00.001 --> 34:03.838
I cannot believe
what we did.

34:03.905 --> 34:06.006
I said I wanted customers
to be happy

34:06.074 --> 34:07.875
and you know what?

34:07.943 --> 34:11.712
90% from our customer
comment cards...

34:11.780 --> 34:15.349
Said they left...

34:15.417 --> 34:16.984
Happy.

34:17.052 --> 34:18.252
<i>Well done.</i>
[applause]

34:18.320 --> 34:19.587
Thank you, chef.

34:19.654 --> 34:21.621
Finally, finally, finally.

34:21.690 --> 34:22.822
<i>How did it feel?</i>
Great, chef.

34:22.891 --> 34:24.391
Awesome.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.261
Now, unfortunately,
elimination has to take place.

34:27.329 --> 34:28.529
[Bleep].

34:28.597 --> 34:31.031
Each team--
blue team, red team--

34:31.099 --> 34:32.766
<i>come up</i>
<i>with two suggestions</i>

34:32.833 --> 34:35.902
based on what you saw
from tonight's service.

34:35.971 --> 34:37.237
<i>Think hard.</i>

34:37.304 --> 34:38.639
Clear?
(All)
Yes, chef.

34:38.706 --> 34:41.976
Upstairs.

34:42.043 --> 34:43.444
We did good, and, like,

34:43.512 --> 34:45.012
we have to nominate
two people

34:45.080 --> 34:47.181
to go up for elimination.

34:47.248 --> 34:48.616
It sucks.

34:48.683 --> 34:51.886
So who's the two
that we're gonna nominate?

34:51.953 --> 34:53.053
Did anything get sent back?

34:53.121 --> 34:54.621
A chicken.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.422
You were helping me
on chicken, Trevor,

34:56.491 --> 34:57.925
<i>so if I go up,</i>
<i>you should too.</i>

34:57.993 --> 34:59.059
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

34:59.127 --> 35:00.728
Sabrina, he was helping
you out.

35:00.795 --> 35:02.463
Every time, "check this.
Check this. Check this."

35:02.531 --> 35:03.998
<i>I was trying</i>
<i>to help you out.</i>

35:04.065 --> 35:05.399
<i>You just threw me</i>
<i>under the bus.</i>

35:05.467 --> 35:06.400
Thanks.
You just made one vote easy--

35:06.468 --> 35:07.601
Sabrina.

35:07.669 --> 35:10.004
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>I agree.</i>

35:10.071 --> 35:12.339
That's it.
Sabrina's on her way home.

35:12.407 --> 35:14.141
If you are gonna [Bleep] Me,
guess what.

35:14.209 --> 35:15.209
I'm gonna [Bleep] You
right back.

35:15.277 --> 35:16.677
We already know one.

35:16.745 --> 35:20.047
It sucks,
but, Nona, without help,

35:20.115 --> 35:22.082
you would have died tonight.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.217
What Trev said
is about right.

35:23.285 --> 35:24.518
I struggled, but I--

35:24.586 --> 35:25.753
I didn't get anything
sent back.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.154
<i>I busted my ass tonight.</i>

35:27.222 --> 35:28.355
I don't want to go home.

35:28.423 --> 35:29.924
(Gail)
Nona struggled.

35:29.991 --> 35:31.859
She pulled us down during
service tonight.

35:31.927 --> 35:32.893
We were behind 'cause
of the garnish station.

35:32.961 --> 35:34.328
Just go up there
and fight.

35:34.396 --> 35:35.029
He ain't gonna
send you home, girl.

35:35.096 --> 35:37.698
<i>You got it.</i>

35:37.766 --> 35:41.001
Guys, I've been up on
the chopping block three times,

35:41.069 --> 35:42.870
and to be quite honest
with you,

35:42.938 --> 35:44.972
I really don't feel like going
up there again.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.540
<i>[Scoffs]</i>
<i>So what you're saying is</i>

35:46.608 --> 35:47.708
I should just vote
myself up

35:47.776 --> 35:48.776
<i>because you've gone up</i>
<i>three times</i>

35:48.843 --> 35:49.643
and put myself in danger.

35:49.711 --> 35:51.712
Seems like suicide.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.280
We're not stupid, Boris.

35:53.348 --> 35:55.115
The weakest team member
is Boris.

35:55.183 --> 35:56.584
He can kiss
his Russian ass good-bye.

35:56.651 --> 36:00.087
Boris has to go home.

36:00.155 --> 36:01.589
I'm not going home.
I don't deserve to go.

36:01.656 --> 36:03.223
I'm not ready to go home.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.458
I'm gonna fight till
the last drop of sweat.

36:04.526 --> 36:05.559
I'm voting for Vinny.

36:05.627 --> 36:07.861
Okay, so do what you got
to do,

36:07.929 --> 36:09.730
but I got no business going
up there tonight.

36:09.798 --> 36:11.498
I made one mistake,
and I corrected

36:11.566 --> 36:13.500
the mistake quick,
and it turned out

36:13.568 --> 36:15.302
to really not be
that big of a deal.

36:15.370 --> 36:17.204
The two people
that were getting yelled at

36:17.272 --> 36:19.106
the most tonight
were Boris and Rob.

36:19.174 --> 36:21.609
I have no choice but to vote
for the two of you.

36:21.676 --> 36:22.943
Mm-Hmm.

36:23.011 --> 36:24.578
I don't feel like
I should go up there either.

36:24.646 --> 36:25.746
I [Bleep] Worked
my ass off.

36:25.814 --> 36:27.014
<i>I thought Russell</i>
<i>could have slid.</i>

36:27.082 --> 36:27.715
<i>He saw me fighting</i>
<i>the whole night</i>

36:27.782 --> 36:28.782
by myself on garnish.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.651
[Bleep] Damn!
<i>I understand.</i>

36:30.719 --> 36:32.820
Listen, Russell,
based on what I'm feeling,

36:32.887 --> 36:34.888
I felt a little slide could have
been warranted here and there.

36:34.956 --> 36:36.590
[Bleep] Damn, bro.

36:36.658 --> 36:38.192
Russell, I feel like,
should be the one up there.

36:38.259 --> 36:39.460
He could have slid over
and helped me,

36:39.527 --> 36:40.894
but he decided not to do that.

36:40.962 --> 36:42.630
I got [Bleep]
Peppered there.

36:42.697 --> 36:44.231
So that's your votes.
Fine. That's fine.

36:44.299 --> 36:46.133
Whatever.

36:50.739 --> 36:53.974
[Sighs]

36:54.042 --> 36:55.376
Tough one, this one.

36:55.443 --> 36:57.144
Very tough.

36:57.212 --> 36:59.179
Nona, red team's first nominee,
and why?

36:59.247 --> 37:03.450
Uh, first nomination
tonight is...

37:03.518 --> 37:05.853
Sabrina...

37:05.920 --> 37:07.388
<i>For lack of communication</i>

37:07.455 --> 37:10.557
and teamwork
throughout the service.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.292
Second nominee,
and why, please?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.961
The second nomination
is myself, chef.

37:14.029 --> 37:14.928
And why?

37:14.996 --> 37:16.730
Based on tonight's performance,

37:16.798 --> 37:18.866
I was in the weeds pretty much
the whole night.

37:18.933 --> 37:20.100
Okay.

37:20.168 --> 37:21.535
<i>Blue team.</i>

37:21.603 --> 37:23.704
Russell, first nominee,
and why, please?

37:23.772 --> 37:25.506
Our first nominee is,
uh, Boris.

37:25.573 --> 37:27.274
<i>He didn't pull</i>
<i>his weight tonight,</i>

37:27.342 --> 37:28.809
and it still is not getting
into his head,

37:28.877 --> 37:31.478
<i>so he needs to go home.</i>

37:31.546 --> 37:33.447
Wow.
Second nominee, and why?

37:33.515 --> 37:36.050
Second nominee is...

37:36.117 --> 37:37.484
Rob.

37:37.552 --> 37:39.119
<i>Rob was buried</i>
<i>all night,</i>

37:39.187 --> 37:40.587
and, you know, everyone
was trying to help him,

37:40.655 --> 37:43.323
<i>and he clearly buried us.</i>

37:43.391 --> 37:45.926
Okay, I asked you
for two suggestions,

37:45.994 --> 37:49.296
and I'm gonna take one
from each team.

37:49.364 --> 37:51.965
From the red...

37:52.033 --> 37:55.469
Nona, step forward.

37:55.537 --> 37:57.571
From the blue...

38:00.675 --> 38:02.543
Rob.

38:08.179 --> 38:10.314
(Announcer)
Both teams completed
dinner service,

38:10.382 --> 38:12.816
but had to nominate two
of their own for elimination.

38:12.884 --> 38:15.185
The red team put up
Sabrina and Nona.

38:15.253 --> 38:17.721
The blue team, Boris and Rob.

38:17.789 --> 38:19.123
Then chef Ramsay...

38:19.190 --> 38:21.292
I'm gonna take one
from each team.

38:21.359 --> 38:22.660
(Announcer)
Narrowed the field.

38:22.727 --> 38:27.665
Nona and Rob, step forward.

38:27.732 --> 38:30.501
Right, Nona,
are you the next chef

38:30.569 --> 38:32.303
<i>for the L.A. market?</i>
Yes, chef.

38:32.370 --> 38:34.438
I'm not convinced.

38:34.506 --> 38:36.440
Tell me why you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:36.508 --> 38:37.908
I'm a hell of a team player.

38:37.976 --> 38:39.710
<i>I give everything I've got.</i>

38:39.778 --> 38:41.111
I fight,
I push back,

38:41.179 --> 38:42.680
<i>and I never give up.</i>

38:42.747 --> 38:45.182
I put my head down,
and I fight through it.

38:45.250 --> 38:48.185
Something quite humble
and honest about you.

38:48.253 --> 38:51.956
I just need to see
this fight.

38:52.023 --> 38:54.525
Rob, tell me why you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.260
Chef, I know tonight
was a rough night,

38:56.328 --> 38:57.695
but I fought through it
way to the end,

38:57.762 --> 38:59.330
and I never
stopped fighting.

38:59.397 --> 39:00.464
I got zero support
on that station.

39:00.532 --> 39:01.665
I fought all the way
through it.

39:01.733 --> 39:04.768
You had no support?

39:04.836 --> 39:06.503
<i>So, yes, I was alone</i>
<i>on the station.</i>

39:06.571 --> 39:07.705
Russell, is that true
that he had no support?

39:07.772 --> 39:10.474
Absolutely not, chef.

39:10.542 --> 39:12.209
I can't do everything
on the station for him, chef,

39:12.277 --> 39:14.311
at the end of the day.

39:14.379 --> 39:16.246
That's not how it went, chef,
really, honestly,

39:16.314 --> 39:17.815
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>knows that.</i>

39:17.882 --> 39:20.117
I mean, I just felt
like Russell definitely had,

39:20.185 --> 39:21.418
<i>you know, an opportunity</i>
<i>to step over and slide,</i>

39:21.486 --> 39:22.853
and I just think he just
stayed the speed limit

39:22.921 --> 39:24.254
and didn't floor it
for us tonight.

39:24.322 --> 39:26.156
<i>I worked hard.</i>

39:26.224 --> 39:30.894
I dug deep, and I did the best
I could with what I had.

39:30.962 --> 39:32.296
Okay.

39:32.364 --> 39:34.431
<i>I thought long and hard</i>
<i>about this.</i>

39:34.499 --> 39:37.401
My decision is...

39:39.971 --> 39:43.741
Rob.

39:46.444 --> 39:49.947
<i>Because it's filthy dirty.</i>

39:50.015 --> 39:51.882
This one is a clean one.

39:51.950 --> 39:54.518
Get it on.
Get back in line.

39:54.586 --> 39:57.454
Nona, back in line.

39:57.522 --> 40:00.691
Both of you, hey, relax.
It was a good service.

40:00.759 --> 40:03.394
<i>Why should anyone go home?</i>
[laughter]

40:03.461 --> 40:05.262
Really?

40:05.330 --> 40:07.698
What?
You can't do that
to a fat guy, chef.

40:07.766 --> 40:08.866
<i>It was a great service.</i>

40:08.933 --> 40:10.000
Oh, my God.

40:10.068 --> 40:13.070
<i>After six horrible services,</i>

40:13.138 --> 40:16.373
we finally cracked it
on service seven.

40:16.441 --> 40:18.542
Yes, chef!
Thank you very much.

40:18.610 --> 40:20.511
Yes?
My God, yes?

40:20.578 --> 40:22.680
Well done. Well done.
Well done. Well done.

40:22.747 --> 40:24.148
Jeez.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.083
Thank you, chef.
Glad to have you back.

40:26.151 --> 40:28.952
I pushed you guys
to the very limit,

40:29.020 --> 40:31.221
<i>and you cracked it,</i>

40:31.289 --> 40:32.956
so tonight
you all get a pass.

40:33.024 --> 40:35.059
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

40:35.126 --> 40:38.028
We will not be getting
another one.

40:38.096 --> 40:39.697
Get a really
good night's sleep,

40:39.764 --> 40:43.200
because tomorrow
it's gonna be a bitch.

40:43.268 --> 40:44.702
Good night.
Get some sleep.

40:44.769 --> 40:46.770
Thank you, chef.
Good night.

40:46.838 --> 40:50.340
Rob, I can feel
that heart beating from here.

40:50.408 --> 40:52.276
[Bleep] Me, man.
That was insane.

40:52.343 --> 40:54.945
I plan on never being
in that [Bleep] Position again.

40:55.013 --> 40:56.380
<i>Nona,</i>

40:56.448 --> 40:57.781
when we go down,
we bounce back.

40:57.849 --> 40:58.882
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

40:58.950 --> 41:02.119
I've got to step it up.

41:02.187 --> 41:03.620
I want the L.A. market.

41:03.688 --> 41:05.656
I want this.
I want this for myself.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.225
I want this for my family.

41:08.293 --> 41:09.493
I want to win it.

41:09.561 --> 41:11.929
(Boris)
I'm not going anywhere.

41:11.996 --> 41:13.931
I refuse to die.
I refuse to go home.

41:13.998 --> 41:16.200
There's only three ways
I can leave--

41:16.267 --> 41:19.136
dead, a winner,
or arrested.

41:19.204 --> 41:21.505
I'm definitely not planning
on getting arrested.

41:21.573 --> 41:24.408
(Gordon)
Tonight I finally got
a respectable service,

41:24.476 --> 41:26.176
so I gave them
a little respect

41:26.244 --> 41:28.145
and didn't send
anyone home.

41:28.213 --> 41:30.447
But tomorrow they're in for
the most intense dinner service

41:30.515 --> 41:33.250
in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

41:37.122 --> 41:38.922
(Announcer)
The winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:38.990 --> 41:40.624
will become head chef
of the brand-new

41:40.692 --> 41:42.760
multimillion-dollar restaurant,
L.A. Market,

41:42.827 --> 41:45.629
at the J.W. Marriott hotel
in downtown Los Angeles.

41:45.697 --> 41:47.965
The salary--a quarter
of a million dollars.

41:48.032 --> 41:49.867
[Cheers and applause]

41:49.934 --> 41:51.935
(Announcer)
And they will also
tour the country

41:52.003 --> 41:54.371
as the official spokesperson
of rosemount estate winery.

41:54.439 --> 41:57.274
Next time, it's a dinner service
unlike any other.

41:57.342 --> 41:59.877
It is our 100th service.

41:59.944 --> 42:01.845
(Announcer)
It's a <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> milestone

42:01.913 --> 42:03.847
and you won't believe
who's coming to dinner.

42:03.915 --> 42:05.282
Who's coming out that limo?

42:05.350 --> 42:06.517
I'm getting real excited.

42:06.584 --> 42:09.153
[Cheers and applause]

42:09.220 --> 42:11.288
Good to see you guys.

42:11.356 --> 42:13.557
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay wants nothing
less than perfection.

42:13.625 --> 42:15.325
Raise the bar now.
You stay above it.

42:15.393 --> 42:16.960
(Announcer)
And he's more intense...

42:17.028 --> 42:19.296
Stop panicking!
Just [Bleep] Focus!

42:19.364 --> 42:20.631
(Announcer)
Than ever.

42:20.698 --> 42:22.699
Wake up!
I would love some help!

42:22.767 --> 42:25.135
[Bleep] Off.
Don't do this to me tonight.

42:25.203 --> 42:27.304
(Announcer)
Sabrina and Trev battle
all night in the kitchen...

42:27.372 --> 42:28.605
Help me!
I am!

42:28.673 --> 42:30.374
Don't [Bleep]
Get on my ass!

42:30.441 --> 42:32.910
(Announceren in the d.
You're a bitch.

42:32.977 --> 42:35.112
(Announcer)
They have the showdown
you've been waiting for.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.281
Don't start on me.
I own my [Bleep] Station!

42:37.348 --> 42:39.049
Whatever!

42:39.117 --> 42:40.651
(Announcer)
And when it comes time
to send someone home...

42:40.718 --> 42:42.486
Take your jacket off!

42:42.554 --> 42:44.555
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay feels he needs
to do something drastic.

42:44.622 --> 42:47.024
I'm not finished yet.
Get your ass up here.

42:47.091 --> 42:49.226
(Announcer)
You don't want to miss
the 100th dinner service...

42:49.294 --> 42:51.261
[Bleep] Pissed.

42:51.329 --> 42:53.730
(Announcer)
Next time on a special edition
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

42:53.798 --> 42:56.166
(Gordon)
My customers deserve the best.
What a letdown.
