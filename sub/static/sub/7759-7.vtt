05:39.006 --> 05:41.108
JUST WHEN WE ALMOST HAD ENOUGH
SAVED FOR THE WEDDING.

HAVE TO CUT A FEW CORNERS,

05:43.477 --> 05:45.713
LIKE PRINTING UP OUR OWN
INVITATIONS ON THE COMPUTER.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.781

05:47.815 --> 05:49.983
- FINE. WE CAN WALK
TO THE CEREMONY.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.719
- THERE MUST
BE SOME OTHER WAY.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.786
- FORGET MY MOM.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.824
THE EARLY-BIRD SPECIAL
WAS HATCHED IN HER HONOR.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.426

05:58.459 --> 06:00.561
- HUH!

A REASON TO.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.939
- I DON'T WANT YOU
BEGGING THEM FOR MONEY.

06:11.972 --> 06:12.940
- I'M NOT BEGGING.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.808
THEY PAID FOR ALL THREE
OF MY SISTER'S WEDDINGS,

06:14.842 --> 06:16.510
SO THEY CAN FUCKING WELL
CHIP IN FOR OURS.

06:16.544 --> 06:20.013

06:21.949 --> 06:24.952
- I CAN'T.
I GOTTA DO INVENTORY.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.588
- I THOUGHT INVENTORY
WAS THE LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.423
- IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS THAT'S ON ITS FEET.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.858
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
YOU'RE JUST STARTING OUT--

06:30.891 --> 06:32.793
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHO IS HE?

06:32.826 --> 06:33.894

06:35.095 --> 06:37.931
- I BET IT'S THAT TEACHER.
- [scoffs]

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
HE'S A PROFESSOR,
NOT A TEACHER.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.669
- OH-HO. THE PROFESSOR.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.638
- SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU,
MARY ANN OR GINGER?

06:44.672 --> 06:46.173
- SO WHEN DO WE
GET TO MEET HIM?

06:46.206 --> 06:47.441
- NEVER!

06:47.475 --> 06:48.609
- WHY? IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM?

06:48.642 --> 06:49.743
- SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.179
I WOULD LIKE THIS ONE TO LIVE,
BEFORE MY BEST FRIENDS

06:52.212 --> 06:54.147
DEVOUR HIM.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.184
- HEY, YOU'RE FETCH DIXON,

I'M A HUGE FAN.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.956
NOT AS HUGE AS YOU--

07:14.267 --> 07:16.136
- NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

TO SAMPLE THE MERCHANDISE,

07:17.838 --> 07:20.240
YOU HAVE TO SIGN ON

SORRY.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.614

07:26.647 --> 07:28.616
- WELL, YOU BETTER
GET USED TO IT.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.750
- EMMETT'S A STAR.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.819
- HIS DICK'S A STAR.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.754
HE'S JUST
THE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.088
CAREFUL, HE'LL GET
A SWELLED HEAD.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.691
- HEY, SAVE IT
FOR THE WEBSITE.

07:37.725 --> 07:42.062
- WILL YOU ALL JUST STOP?
I'M NOT A STAR.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.832
I'M STILL LITTLE OLD ME,
YOU KNOW, PLAIN OLD COUNTRY-BOY

07:44.865 --> 07:45.933
FROM MISSISSIPPI.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.869
GIVING MY FRIEND TEDDY
A HELPING HAND.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.640
- [snickering]

07:52.673 --> 07:54.107
- AND THE WAY LYNNETTE'S
BEEN HINTING,

07:54.141 --> 07:56.844
I THINK I MIGHT
BE A GRANDMOTHER SOON.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.246
YOU ALREADY ARE...

07:59.279 --> 08:00.848
IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.684
- I KNOW, DEAR.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.119
- [sighs]

08:06.153 --> 08:08.822
- THERE YOU ARE.
- MM, THANK YOU.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.059
- UH, MRS. PETERSEN,
THAT NECKLACE IS SO LOVELY.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.861
IS THAT RED CORAL
FROM BALI?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.996
- WHY, YES.
HAVE YOU BEEN?

08:16.029 --> 08:19.900
- NO. NO, ACTUALLY, MY AUNT
DOTTY OWNS A JEWELRY STORE.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.735
- OH.
- LYNNETTE BOUGHT IT FOR ME

08:21.769 --> 08:24.037
ON ONE OF HER HONEYMOONS.
- DON'T ASK WHICH.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.740
- WE DECIDED TO SKIP
OUR HONEYMOON FOR NOW.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.309
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING
ALL THE EXPENSES?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.944
- WE'RE OUT OF ROLLS.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.312
CAN WE GET SOME ROLLS HERE,
PLEASE?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.446
- OF COURSE.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.116
- WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED
CHEZ DENIS OVER ON THE RIVER.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.318
DUNCAN TOOK LYNNETTE THERE
ON SATURDAY.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.053
HAD A LOVELY MEAL.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.556
- WE'RE THINKING OF HAVING THEM
CATER OUR RECEPTION.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.957
- AREN'T THEY EXPENSIVE?

08:43.991 --> 08:46.093
- WELL, NO MORE THAN
THE ONE LYNNETTE USED...

08:46.126 --> 08:47.561
ALL THREE TIMES.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.330
- YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
SHE'S CONSISTENT.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.899
- AND BESIDES,
GETTING MARRIED THESE DAYS

08:51.932 --> 08:54.768
IS AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.175
THAT'S WHY WE WERE HOPING
THAT...

09:02.209 --> 09:04.077
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP US OUT A LITTLE.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.178
- IF YOU SEE THE WAITER,
COULD YOU ASK HIM

09:05.212 --> 09:06.747
FOR SOME BUTTER?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.048
- I MEAN, WE'RE HANDLING
IT ALL BY OURSELVES,

09:08.081 --> 09:09.983
BUT WE COULD USE
SOME ASSISTANCE,

09:10.017 --> 09:13.186
NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.955
ANYTHING WOULD BE HELPFUL.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.156
- HONEY...

09:16.189 --> 09:17.791
- YOU HELPED LYNNETTE
WITH HER WEDDING.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.027
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.329
- WHY IS IT DIFFERENT?

09:22.362 --> 09:27.167
- BECAUSE HER WEDDING
WAS REAL.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.639
YOURS IS...

09:31.672 --> 09:34.708
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOURS IS.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.814
HOW'S YOUR STEAK, DEAR?
- JUST GREAT.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.920
- [chuckling]
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

09:46.954 --> 09:49.122
SINCE I MADE OUT
IN THE PARK.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.725
- WELL, STICK WITH ME,
AND MAYBE YOU'LL GET LUCKY.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.928
- AH, REALLY?
- I FINISHED YOUR BOOK.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.997
- OH, YEAH? SO HOW--
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.232
THE INSECURE WRITER ASKED,
TRYING DESPERATELY

09:59.266 --> 10:01.168
TO SOUND NONCHALANT.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.905
- I DIDN'T. I LOVED IT.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.708
- YOU DIDN'T.
[chuckling]

10:07.741 --> 10:09.242
- ESPECIALLY THAT PART
WHERE THE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS

10:09.276 --> 10:11.979
IN THAILAND CONFISCATED
YOUR HIV MEDS.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.747
- OH, YEAH.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.249
THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST
DAYS OF MY LIFE.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.386
BUT, AS THEY SAY,
OUT OF ADVERSITY,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.789
YOU KNOW, COMES KNOWLEDGE,
AND...

10:21.822 --> 10:23.223
I'VE LEARNED
TO PUT MY FEARS ASIDE

10:23.256 --> 10:27.127
AND JUST FIND SERENITY
IN THE CHAOS.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.130
- I WISH I COULD DO THAT.
I DO JUST THE OPPOSITE.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.100
I COULD FIND CHAOS IN SERENITY
WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.301
- [chuckles]

10:34.334 --> 10:37.404
- I THINK THAT THE SECRET
IS TO STOP REGRETTING THE PAST

10:37.437 --> 10:43.410
AND FEARING THE FUTURE,
AND JUST LIVE IN THE NOW.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.879
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
MY MOM WOULD SAY.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.181
SHE ALWAYS SAYS, "IF YOU'VE
GOT ONE FOOT IN TOMORROW

10:48.215 --> 10:50.784
AND ONE FOOT IN YESTERDAY,
YOU'LL PISS ON TODAY."

10:50.818 --> 10:52.219
- [laugh]

10:52.252 --> 10:54.154
- ACTUALLY SHE SAYS "SHIT"
BUT I WANTED TO CLEAN IT UP

10:54.187 --> 10:55.789
A LITTLE.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.057
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,
YOUR MOM AND BUDDHA

10:57.090 --> 10:58.792
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.894
- WHAT, JENNY CRAIG DROPOUTS?

11:00.928 --> 11:03.263
- NO. NO, UM...

11:03.296 --> 11:04.998
HE TEACHES YOU TO...

11:05.032 --> 11:07.768
FOCUS ON THE SMALLEST DETAILS.

11:07.801 --> 11:11.872
YOU KNOW, THE BREEZE
AGAINST YOUR CHEEK.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.475
THE WAY YOUR SHIRT
FALLS AGAINST YOUR BODY.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.312
THE FEEL OF SOMEONE'S
HAND ON YOUR BACK.

11:19.346 --> 11:24.284
HELPS YOU REALIZE
THAT RIGHT NOW, THIS MOMENT IS--

11:24.317 --> 11:28.388
IT'S ALL THERE IS.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.324
- WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN...

11:31.358 --> 11:34.361
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.230
- [whispers]
YEAH.

11:42.135 --> 11:46.006
[overlapping chatter]

11:50.277 --> 11:52.445
[softly]
COME ON.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.982
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.483
- TO EXPERIENCE THE NOW.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.486
[electronic dance music]

11:59.519 --> 12:07.494
*

12:13.834 --> 12:15.836
- YEAH, I'VE JUST--I'VE GOT
AN EYE FOR THIS KIND OF THING

12:15.869 --> 12:18.005
AND I CAN TELL
YOU'VE GOT TALENT.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.441
BIG, BIG TALENT,
SO IF YOU EVER WANT

12:21.474 --> 12:24.111
TO EARN SOME EXTRA CASH

12:24.144 --> 12:27.981
IN YOUR SPARE TIME,
JUST, UH, GIMME A CALL.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.416
WE'LL SET UP AN AUDITION.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.984
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.519
- THANKS, MAN.
- THANKS.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.791
- HEY, PORN KING,
WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE ME

12:37.825 --> 12:40.460
TO SOME OF YOUR
NEW FRIENDS?

12:40.493 --> 12:43.263
- ANY TIME, BRI.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.465
- IS THAT A ROLEX?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.868
- YOU BET IT IS.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.970
ALL THOSE YEARS,
SEEING THOSE WEALTHY CLIENTS

12:50.003 --> 12:52.840
COME IN WITH THEIR BIG CARS
AND THEIR FANCY JEWELRY,

12:52.873 --> 12:53.974
AND THERE I WAS,
THIS DUMB JERK

12:54.007 --> 12:55.242
IN A CUBICLE,
HUNCHED OVER A COMPUTER

12:55.275 --> 12:57.177
MAKING THEM RICH.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.545
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.013
- HEY, THERE'S FETCH!

13:00.047 --> 13:02.415
- HEY, HON.
YOU'RE SO HOT, FETCH!

13:02.449 --> 13:06.253
- OOH! OKAY.
ALL RIGHT. EASY, BOYS.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.222
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH OF ME
TO GO AROUND FOR EVERYONE.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.557
[chuckles]

13:10.590 --> 13:14.127
WHOO!
[chuckles]

13:14.161 --> 13:16.163
ULTIMATELY
IT'S ALL SO EMPTY.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.497
YOU KNOW, AT THE END
OF THE NIGHT,

13:17.530 --> 13:20.901
YOU STILL GO HOME ALONE,
YOU KNOW?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.240
BUT NOT TONIGHT!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.109
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD IT.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.277
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.180
YOU HAVE A MATINEE TOMORROW.
- SO?

13:33.213 --> 13:36.316
- SO YOU NEED
TO CONSERVE YOUR STRENGTH.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.319
AND NO MORE DRINKING
AND EATING PEANUTS,

13:39.352 --> 13:40.587
YOU'LL GAIN WEIGHT.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.523
NOW GO HOME,
GET SOME SLEEP.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.894
THAT'S AN ORDER.

13:48.929 --> 13:53.200
HI. HOW'S IT GOING?
I'M TED SCHMIDT.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.469
I OWN JERKATWORK.NET.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.905
I'VE GOT AN EYE
FOR THIS KIND OF THING

13:57.938 --> 13:59.572
AND I CAN TELL
YOU'VE GOT BIG TALENT.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.909
- SO MR. PRODUCER GETS
TO GO HOME WITH THE HOTTIE,

14:01.942 --> 14:05.378
AND THE POOR LITTLE STAR
HAS TO GO HOME ALONE?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.047
- WELL, HE--HE'S RIGHT.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.417
I NEED TO CONSERVE
MY STRENGTH.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.853
- WELL, LET ME
SEE YOUR WRIST.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.491
THAT'S A STUNNING WATCH
YOU'RE WEARING.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.961
- I'M NOT WEARING A WATCH.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.497
WOW, EMMETT,
YOU'RE REALLY OBSERVANT.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.201
HE'S GOT A ROLEX.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.173
AND YOU BETTER HURRY HOME.

14:33.206 --> 14:37.110
A STAR NEEDS
HIS BEAUTY REST.

14:37.144 --> 14:40.914
- * TO BELIEVE

14:40.948 --> 14:44.384
* BELIEVE

14:44.417 --> 14:47.988
* TO BELIEVE

14:48.021 --> 14:49.522
* BELIEVE
- I THOUGHT WHEN YOU SAID

14:49.556 --> 14:51.258
YOU WANTED
TO EXPERIENCE THE NOW,

14:51.291 --> 14:53.560
YOU MEANT SOMETHING SPIRITUAL.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.128
- I DID.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.997
THIS TRIBE I VISITED
IN NEW GUINEA

14:57.030 --> 14:58.966
WOULD DANCE
UNTIL THEY COLLAPSED.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.168
IT'S HOW THEY FREED
THEMSELVES FROM THEIR BODIES,

15:01.201 --> 15:02.435
FROM TIME.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.937
LOOKED JUST LIKE THIS,

15:03.971 --> 15:05.372
UH, EXCEPT FOR
THE LIGHT SHOW,

15:05.405 --> 15:10.343
BUT, UH, THEN
THEY HAD SHOOTING STARS.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.380
- * TO LIVE WITHOUT FEAR

15:13.413 --> 15:19.119
* BELIEVE

15:20.988 --> 15:24.091
* BELIEVE

15:28.161 --> 15:31.431
* BELIEVE

15:31.464 --> 15:35.368
- THERE'S MICHAEL
WITH SOME HOTTIE.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.537
- * SOMEWHERE

15:37.570 --> 15:40.640
- HEY, MICHAEL!

15:40.673 --> 15:42.342
OVER HERE!

15:42.375 --> 15:45.312
- UH-OH. WE'VE BEEN SPOTTED.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.247
I SHOULD WARN YOU,
MY FRIENDS CAN BE A LITTLE--

15:47.280 --> 15:50.717
- WHAT? JUDGMENTAL?
UH, VICIOUS? CONDESCENDING?

15:50.750 --> 15:54.421
- SO YOU'VE MET THEM?
- [laughs]

15:57.124 --> 15:58.625
- * BELIEVE

15:58.658 --> 16:03.530
- BEN, THIS IS TED,
JUSTIN, AND BRIAN.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.032
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.499
- THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING INVENTORY.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.201
- I WAS.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.038
- YOU LOOK AWFULLY FAMILIAR.
UH, DID YOU GO TO PENN?

16:11.071 --> 16:12.339
- UH, YALE UNDERGRAD,

16:12.372 --> 16:15.175
THEN IOWA FOR THE
CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAM.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.278
- BEN WROTE A BOOK CALLED
R-U-1-2.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.047
- [snaps fingers] YEAH, THAT'S
WHERE I RECOGNIZED YOU FROM.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.215
I SAW YOUR INTERVIEW
IN THE ADVOCATE.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.750
I RAN RIGHT OUT
AND BOUGHT IT.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.218
- OH, REALLY?
SO YOU WERE THE ONE.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.386
- [laughs]

16:26.419 --> 16:28.488
COME ON, IT WAS--
YOU GOT GREAT REVIEWS.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.124
I MEAN, IT WAS SO HONEST,
SO FORTHRIGHT.

16:31.158 --> 16:35.362
IT WAS SO, UH,
SO REVEALING.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.264
- YEAH, WELL THAT'S--THAT'S
WHAT WRITERS DO, YOU KNOW.

16:37.297 --> 16:41.501
WE JUST CUT OURSELVES OPEN
AND BLEED ALL OVER THE PAGE.

16:41.534 --> 16:45.272
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE.
- SEE YOU GUYS.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.413
- HE'S REALLY HOT.
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.

16:53.446 --> 16:57.484
- LOOKS, BRAINS.
HE'S A NICE GUY TOO.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.520
I'D SAY HE'S PERFECT
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.023
HE'S POSITIVE.

17:12.432 --> 17:16.103
- I GOT YOU A CROISSANT.
- I DON'T WANT A CROISSANT.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.470
- YOU LOVE CROISSANTS.

17:17.504 --> 17:21.141
- I SAID I DON'T WANT ONE, OKAY?
SO DROP IT.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.242
[thud]

17:22.275 --> 17:24.144
- I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.214
- I WISH YOU'D DROP IT TOO.
THIS CHARMING MOOD.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.815
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.451
OH, I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE ASKED THEM.

17:31.484 --> 17:35.455
- SO YOU DID.
THEY SAID NO. NOW IT'S OVER.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.125
COME ON. LET'S GO LOOK
AT WEDDING CAKES.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.293
- WHAT FOR?
WE CAN'T AFFORD ONE.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.661
MAYBE IF WE'RE CAREFUL,
WE CAN SAVE UP ENOUGH

17:41.694 --> 17:43.196
FOR A DING DONG.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.732
- LOOK, WE'LL FIND THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR IT.

17:45.765 --> 17:50.170
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.
[heavy sigh]

17:50.203 --> 17:53.506
IT'S ABOUT--
- LOVE?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.442
YOU WANT THEM TO SHOW YOU
THE SAME ATTENTION

17:55.475 --> 17:58.411
THEY SHOW LYNNETTE.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.347
- YEAH.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.783
- MAYBE WE HAVE TO PUT FORTH
MORE OF AN EFFORT.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.518
WE'VE NEVER REALLY
ASKED THEM OVER

18:05.552 --> 18:10.757
TO SEE HOW WE LIVE,
MEET OUR FRIENDS.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.162
WHICH MAKES US
JUST AS GUILTY AS THEY ARE.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.464
- SO WHAT DO WE DO?

18:17.497 --> 18:20.367
- INVITE THEM OVER.
THROW A LITTLE PARTY.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.902
- YOU'RE SERIOUS.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.539
- IF THEY COULD SEE
THAT WE'RE A REAL FAMILY

18:26.573 --> 18:29.376
WITH A REAL LIFE
JUST LIKE YOUR SISTER,

18:29.409 --> 18:33.180
THEY MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

18:33.213 --> 18:37.717
HEY, IT'S AT LEAST
WORTH A SHOT.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.653
COME ON.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.395
- MAY I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.163
- YEAH. WE'D LIKE
TO LOOK AT WEDDING CAKES.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.864
- OH, LOVELY.
THEY'RE OUR SPECIALTY.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.366
- "I'M POSITIVE."

18:53.400 --> 18:54.534
IT WAS THE FIRST THING
OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.702
- AFTER YOUR DICK.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.337
- IT'S COMMENDABLE
THAT HE TOLD YOU,

18:57.370 --> 18:58.438
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT

18:58.471 --> 19:00.607
THAT YOU'RE
PLAYING WITH FIRE.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.775
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENS
IF A CONDOM BREAKS

19:02.809 --> 19:04.711
OR HE'S FLOSSING HIS TEETH
AND HIS GUMS BLEED?

19:04.744 --> 19:05.845
- OR IF HE SHOOTS HIS LOAD

19:05.878 --> 19:07.447
AND YOU'RE BENDING OVER
TO TIE YOUR SHOE

19:07.480 --> 19:09.249
AND IT ACCIDENTALLY
FLIES UP YOUR ASS?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.783
- [chuckles]
- JESUS CHRIST, BRIAN,

19:10.817 --> 19:11.851
DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A FUCKING JOKE

19:11.884 --> 19:14.187
OUT OF EVERYTHING,
EVEN YOUR BEST FRIEND'S SAFETY?

19:14.221 --> 19:17.324
- I KNOW HOW TO BE SAFE.
- NO, YOU THINK YOU DO.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.226
WE ALL DO.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.527
IT'S MORE THAN
JUST BEING CAREFUL.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.662
IT'S KNOWING THAT
YOU'RE LIVING WITH DEATH,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.498
KNOWING THAT BEN HAS SOMETHING
INSIDE HIM THAT COULD KILL HIM.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.934
AND IF YOU HAVE
JUST ONE LITTLE FUCK-UP,

19:27.967 --> 19:30.670
ONE MOMENT OF FORGETFULNESS,
JUST ONE MISTAKE,

19:30.703 --> 19:34.507
IT COULD KILL YOU TOO.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.676
- I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE DRAMATIC, TEDDY.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.977
- [scoffs]

19:38.010 --> 19:39.212
- THERE ARE PLENTY
OF GUYS WHO HAVE BOYFRIENDS

19:39.246 --> 19:40.280
WHO ARE POSITIVE.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.482
- WELL, THOSE PEOPLE
AREN'T MICHAEL.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.716
AND YOU WEREN'T
SO FUCKING NONCHALANT

19:43.750 --> 19:45.418
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFECTED.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.287
- LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

19:47.320 --> 19:49.489
BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEN
LIKE HE'S A DISEASE

19:49.522 --> 19:52.459
AND NOT A PERSON.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.327
AND IF YOU WERE SEEING
SOMEONE THAT YOU CARED ABOUT

19:54.361 --> 19:56.763
WHO WAS POSITIVE,
I THINK YOU'D FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.798
- NO, I'M SORRY, I KNOW
IT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT

19:58.831 --> 20:00.633
OR EVEN NICE, BUT NO,
I WOULDN'T DO IT.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.435
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I LIKED THE GUY.

20:02.469 --> 20:06.906
- WOULDN'T DO WHAT, HONEY?
- DATE SOMEONE WHO'S POSITIVE.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.243
- WELL, THAT'S A HELL
OF AN ATTITUDE.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.744
AND I'VE GOTTA SAY
I'M KINDA SURPRISED HEARING IT

20:11.778 --> 20:12.845
FROM ONE OF YOU,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.481
CONSIDERING ALL THE GUYS
YOU FUCK.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.816
- YEAH, NUMBERS MAY VARY
FROM PERSON TO PERSON.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.452
- I MEAN, ONE OF YOU
COULD BE POSITIVE.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.853
THE REASON YOU'RE NOT
CERTAINLY ISN'T BECAUSE

20:20.887 --> 20:23.490
YOU'RE ALWAYS CAREFUL.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.959
I KNOW GODDAMN WELL
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

20:26.993 --> 20:31.798
YOU'RE LUCKY.
YOU'RE FUCKING LUCKY.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.600
SO DON'T TELL ME
YOU COULDN'T LOVE SOMEBODY

20:33.633 --> 20:37.570
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
AS FORTUNATE AS YOU ARE.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.806
IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON TO,
IF YOU ASK ME.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.476
- THANK YOU, MOTHER.
- WHAT FOR, HONEY?

20:43.510 --> 20:46.546
- BEN'S POSITIVE.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.556
- SO CAN I GET YOU GUYS
ANYTHING ELSE?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.791
- MM-MM.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.832
- YOU'RE ON IN FIVE MINUTES.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

21:05.865 --> 21:10.837
- OH, UM, PREPARING A LIST.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.840
- WELL, YOU CAN DO YOUR
GROCERY SHOPPING LATER, OKAY?

21:13.873 --> 21:16.843
- IT'S--UH, IT'S NOT
THAT KIND OF LIST.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.446
- [sighs]

21:23.416 --> 21:26.986
"PRIVATE DRESSING ROOM
WITH TOILET, ROTATING BED,

21:27.019 --> 21:28.521
10% OF GROSS PROFIT."

21:28.555 --> 21:29.856
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.525
- UH, THEY'RE--THEY'RE
CALLED ARTIST'S DEMANDS.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.461
- LUBE? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE LUBE?

21:34.494 --> 21:37.664
- THAT GREASE IS SO CHEAP,
YOU COULD FRY CHICKEN IN IT.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.399
- THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

21:39.432 --> 21:42.435
- IF IT IS,
I FAIL TO SEE THE HUMOR.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.771
OH, UM, DON'T,
UH, DON'T FORGET THAT ONE.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.707
KIND OF MY FAVORITE.

21:47.740 --> 21:52.579
- YOUR NAME OVER THE BED.
- WELL, I AM THE STAR.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.347
THE STAR GETS TOP BILLING.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.983
I WAS THINKING
OF USING JUST, "FETCH."

21:57.016 --> 21:58.685
YOU KNOW, LIKE CHER.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.621
ALL DONE UP, TWINKLY LIGHTS,
SO MY FANS CAN SEE

22:01.654 --> 22:03.490
WHEN YOU PULL BACK
FOR A LONG SHOT.

22:03.523 --> 22:07.427
- WELL, EXCUSE ME, CHER,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE LONG SHOT

22:07.460 --> 22:09.429
YOUR FANS ARE INTERESTED IN,
SO COME ON.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.664
[snaps fingers]
LESS YAK AND MORE JACK.

22:11.698 --> 22:16.636
- WHAT ABOUT MY DEMANDS?
- [scoffs] WHAT, YOU MEAN THESE?

22:18.605 --> 22:23.843
LOOK, EMMETT,

22:23.876 --> 22:25.712
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,

22:25.745 --> 22:28.047
YOU'D STILL BE MOONLIGHTING
AS A NAKED MAID,

22:28.080 --> 22:29.416
"BUFFING IN THE BUFF,"

22:29.449 --> 22:30.950
TRYING TO PICK UP
A FEW EXTRA BUCKS, OKAY?

22:30.983 --> 22:33.586
- YEAH, AND, UH,
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,

22:33.620 --> 22:36.923
YOU'D STILL BE A PENCIL-PUSHER
PULLING YOUR PUD.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.758
- OH, SO I OWE
ALL THIS TO YOU?

22:38.791 --> 22:41.861
- HMM. DIFFICULT QUESTION.
LET ME THINK.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.063
YES!

22:44.096 --> 22:46.866
- I CAN REPLACE YOU
WHENEVER I WANT.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.469
THEN WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY
YOUR FANS FORGET.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.837
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.506
DICKS LIKE YOU...

22:53.540 --> 22:56.643
DIME A DOZEN.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.812
- WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT.

22:59.846 --> 23:03.015
YOU FIND SOME TWINKY
WITH A DINKY,

23:03.049 --> 23:05.117
AND SEE HOW
FAR YOU GET.

23:05.151 --> 23:09.021
OH, AND WHEN YOU DO,
GIVE HIM THIS.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.991
HE'S GOING TO NEED IT.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.466
- LAST TIME I SAW YOU
CLEANING THE TCHOTCKES

23:19.499 --> 23:22.835
WAS WHEN MICHAEL
MOVED AWAY WITH DAVID.

23:22.869 --> 23:26.038
- I'M JUST SICK OF SEEING THIS
PLACE LIKE A GODDAMNED PIGSTY.

23:26.072 --> 23:30.477
THAT'S ALL.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.579
- WOULD YOU STOP WINDEXING
FOR HALF A SECOND

23:32.612 --> 23:35.648
AND TALK TO ME?

23:35.682 --> 23:41.187
- I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

23:41.220 --> 23:45.725
- IT'S PERSONAL.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.761
- WHAT COULD BE PERSONAL
AFTER YOU'VE WIPED MY ASS?

23:48.795 --> 23:52.565
- YOU HAVEN'T WIPED MINE.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.968
- YOU'VE ALREADY
CLEANED THAT CLOWN--

23:56.002 --> 23:57.537
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

23:57.570 --> 24:01.708
SHIT! NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

24:05.111 --> 24:09.081
- [heavy sigh]
I'M SORRY.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.217
SIS.
- GET AWAY!

24:30.737 --> 24:33.740
THIS NEW GUY...

24:33.773 --> 24:37.544
THAT MICHAEL'S DATING,
THIS, UM, THIS BEN.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.050
HE'S POSITIVE.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.719
- OH.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.088
SO?

24:49.121 --> 24:53.125
- SO...

24:53.159 --> 24:55.995
I DON'T WANT HIM
DATING ANYONE WHO'S SICK.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.831
- WHO SAID HE'S SICK?

25:01.233 --> 25:04.537
- I KNEW I COULDN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.972
- SO NEGATIVE PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

25:06.005 --> 25:07.707
TO DATE POSITIVE PEOPLE,
IS THAT IT?

25:07.740 --> 25:10.777
- DON'T TWIST MY WORDS!

25:13.245 --> 25:15.748
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

25:15.782 --> 25:17.884
- HE'S MY SON.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.987
I DON'T WANT HIM
GETTIN' ANYTHING.

25:27.694 --> 25:31.197
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS...

25:31.230 --> 25:33.032
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

25:33.065 --> 25:34.834
I WISH MY SON WASN'T GAY.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.704
- YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.773
- NOT IF IT MEANS
I HAVE TO WATCH HIM PUKING,

25:40.807 --> 25:44.611
AND SHITTING
AND WASTING AWAY TO NOTHING.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.846
- I CAN'T LISTEN
TO ANY MORE OF THIS.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.016
- DO YOU THINK I WANT MICHAEL
TO END UP LIKE YOU?

25:53.753 --> 25:56.956
JEEZ.

25:56.989 --> 26:00.593
OH, SHIT. MICHAEL!

26:03.730 --> 26:05.698
I'M JUST GETTING SOME STUFF
AND THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.166
- HONEY...

26:07.199 --> 26:08.668
LOOK, MICHAEL, SWEETHEART--

26:08.701 --> 26:10.002
- HOW COULD YOU TALK THAT WAY
TO UNCLE VIC?

26:10.036 --> 26:11.070
YOU REALLY HURT HIM!

26:11.103 --> 26:14.206
- PEOPLE SAY A LOT OF THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.344
AND I'M UPSET.
I'M VERY FUCKING UPSET.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.212
AND HOW LONG
WERE YOU GONNA WAIT

26:20.246 --> 26:23.115
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT BEN?

26:23.149 --> 26:24.984
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D CARE!

26:25.017 --> 26:26.853
ESPECIALLY AFTER
ALL THE NOBLE SENTIMENTS

26:26.886 --> 26:31.257
AND HASH BROWNS YOU WERE
DISHING OUT AT THE DINER.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.192
- ALL RIGHT.

26:33.225 --> 26:37.329
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU VERY,
VERY HAPPY.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.667
YOU ALWAYS WANTED
A NORMAL MOTHER?

26:40.700 --> 26:43.703
OKAY, YOU GOT ONE.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.271
I DON'T WANT YOU
DATING THAT GUY.

26:45.304 --> 26:49.175
- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT!
AND DON'T TELL ME WHO TO DATE!

26:49.208 --> 26:50.777
I'M 30 YEARS OLD.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.979
WHO I DATE
AND WHAT I DO

26:53.012 --> 26:56.215
IS NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN
FUCKING BUSINESS!

27:03.389 --> 27:05.958
- WE'RE REALLY LUCKY.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.027
- WHAT? LIVING IN
THIS LAND OF PLENTY?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.663
HMM. ROLL OVER.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.836
- EVERY TIME MICHAEL
AND BEN HAVE SEX,

27:16.869 --> 27:19.271
THINK OF ALL THAT
THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

27:19.305 --> 27:23.075
- IT'S MICHAEL'S DECISION.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.444
IS THAT A PIMPLE
ON YOUR ASS?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.146
- WHERE?
- RIGHT THERE.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.380
- WHERE?
- RIGHT THERE.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.417
- SHUT UP.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.023
NO MATTER HOW LONG
THEY'RE TOGETHER,

27:37.056 --> 27:41.327
EVEN IF IT'S FOREVER,
THEY CAN NEVER DO IT RAW.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.697
- UM, NEITHER HAVE WE.

27:44.731 --> 27:49.401
- YEAH, BUT WE COULD.
IF WE WANTED.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.841
I MEAN...

27:54.874 --> 27:57.877
WE'RE BOTH NEGATIVE.

28:00.847 --> 28:04.316
- YOU WANT ME
TO FUCK YOU BAREBACK?

28:04.350 --> 28:06.719
- YES.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.921
- COME INSIDE
YOUR TIGHT LITTLE ASS?

28:08.955 --> 28:13.392
- DO IT.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.296
FUCK ME.

28:17.329 --> 28:23.169
- FUCK YOURSELF.
- WHAT?

28:23.202 --> 28:26.338
- YOU STUPID LITTLE TWAT.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.809
NEVER LET ANYONE
FUCK YOU WITHOUT A CONDOM.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.210
- YOU'RE NOT JUST ANYONE.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.145
- YEAH, I'M SURE THAT'S
WHAT BEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE GUY

28:33.179 --> 28:37.316
WHO INFECTED HIM.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.957
PUT IT ON ME.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.166
HMM.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.976
MM!

29:07.413 --> 29:11.750
- [gasping]

29:15.054 --> 29:18.991
- I WANT YOU SAFE.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.127
AND I WANT YOU AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.763
- [sighs]

29:27.900 --> 29:29.235
- WOULD YOU ASK LINDSAY

29:29.268 --> 29:31.303
WHERE SHE WANTS ME
TO PUT THESE PLATES?

29:31.337 --> 29:32.905
- THE BLUE OR THE RED?

29:32.939 --> 29:35.574
- OKAY. THE TEA SERVICE
IS POLISHED.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.276
THE FLOWERS ARE ALL ARRANGED.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.546
THOSE VEGETARIAN ROLL-UPS
LOOK SCRUMPTIOUS. HUH.

29:40.579 --> 29:43.549
HOW DO I LOOK?

29:43.582 --> 29:46.285
- LIKE A FUCKING NUN.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TITS?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.889
- [sighs]

29:49.922 --> 29:51.390
- WHO KNEW MY YEAR WORKING
IN A PIERCING SALON

29:51.423 --> 29:53.259
WOULD COME IN SO HANDY.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.427
[doorbell rings]
- THAT'S TASHA AND HER HARP.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.029
- SOMEBODY BETTER GET THE DOOR.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.165
- I JUST PUT IT DOWN.
DID YOU GRAB IT?

29:59.198 --> 30:00.900
- OH, SORRY.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.434
- I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE THE HARP.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.371
- [scoffs] I'M INTO
FUCKING NOT PLUCKING.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.907
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR TITS?

30:07.940 --> 30:11.177
HEY, SONNY-BOY, YOUR OLD MAN'S
HERE TO RESCUE YOU.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.914
- HI, I'M LEDA.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.984
- AH, MELANIE'S EVIL EX.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.419
- AND YOU MUST
BE THE ANTICHRIST.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.922
BIG FAN.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.456
OH, DON'T BOTHER,
IT'S A VIRGIN.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.059
- THE SITTER'S COMING
FOR GUS THIS AFTERNOON.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.594
TAKE HIM TO THE PARK.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.529
BE CAREFUL ON THE SWINGS.
DON'T GET HIM DIRTY.

30:30.562 --> 30:34.300
BE BACK BY 2:00.
AND WEAR SOMETHING NICE.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.235
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- SHAVE.

30:36.268 --> 30:40.339
- MY BALLS ARE AS CLEAN
AS A WHISTLE.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.340
[phone rings]

30:41.373 --> 30:43.209
- HI.
- TASHA, FINALLY.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.877
LEDA, CAN YOU
SHOW HER WHERE TO PUT IT?

30:44.911 --> 30:48.314
- [chuckles]
- IT'S TOO EASY.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.482
- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE
LINDSAY'S PARENTS FEEL AT HOME.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.251
- WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE RENTED CASKETS.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.921
- I SAY WE GREET 'EM
WEARING STRAP-ONS.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.256
EVER BEEN FUCKED
BY A DYKE WITH A DILDO?

30:57.289 --> 30:58.925
- [chuckles]
IS THAT AN OFFER?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.492
- THIS IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO LINDSAY,

31:00.526 --> 31:04.396
SO COULD BOTH OF YOU KEEP
YOUR FUCKING FOUL MOUTHS SHUT?

31:10.236 --> 31:13.405
- THEY'RE NOT COMING.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.343
- ARE WE SURPRISED?

31:17.376 --> 31:18.978
- MOM SAID DADDY
SLIPPED A DISC

31:19.011 --> 31:21.180
AND HE'LL BE ON HIS BACK
FOR DAYS.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.115
- WELL,
THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE.

31:23.149 --> 31:26.485
- SHUT UP, BRIAN.
- [giggles]

31:26.518 --> 31:29.621
[door closes]

31:33.192 --> 31:35.928
- IT WAS LIKE AN EPISODE
OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.163
- MY FAVORITE WAS THE ONE
WHERE YOU COULD

31:37.196 --> 31:40.332
TRADE IN YOUR OLD BODY
FOR A HOT, NEW ONE.

31:40.366 --> 31:45.071
- SHE ACTUALLY SAID
SHE WISHED I WASN'T GAY.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.907
- WELL, I'LL ALWAYS BE GLAD
YOU'RE A BIG, FAT QUEER.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.414
- YOU TWO MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE.

31:55.447 --> 31:59.185
HEY, THERE, AREN'T YOU SWEET?

31:59.218 --> 32:02.121
HI, SWEETIE.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.290
AND YOUR BABY LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.726
[chuckles]

32:07.759 --> 32:09.661
- [mock chuckle]
- [laughs]

32:09.695 --> 32:13.099
- SO SWEET.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.167
YOU KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.302
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:16.335 --> 32:17.436
THE BABY'S THE SPITTING IMAGE
OF YOU.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.706
- I MEAN DEBBIE.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.274
YOU SHOULD FORGET BEN.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.411
- [sighs] WHAT
THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW?

32:25.444 --> 32:28.514
- WELL, LET'S SEE,
I KNOW ADVERTISING.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.449
AND I KNOW YOU.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.184
THOSE ADS YOU SEE
FOR THE COCKTAILS

32:32.218 --> 32:35.587
WITH THE GREAT-LOOKING GUYS
SKIING AND MOUNTAIN-CLIMBING,

32:35.621 --> 32:36.722
LIKE ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO

32:36.755 --> 32:38.290
IS POP A LITTLE
PROTEASE INHIBITOR,

32:38.324 --> 32:42.461
AND YOU TOO CAN HAVE
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.064
WELL, IT'S JUST KIND
OF TOUGH DOWNHILL RACING

32:45.097 --> 32:48.067
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
NON-STOP DIARRHEA.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.738
- I CAN HANDLE IT.
- WELL, THEN HANDLE IT.

32:52.771 --> 32:58.177
KISS IT. JERK IT OFF.
JUST DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH IT.

33:02.214 --> 33:06.485
- MRS. PETERSEN?
- MELANIE. WHAT A SURPRISE.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.659
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M JUST ON MY WAY OUT.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.762
- GEORGE, BARBARA,
IS THAT YOU?

33:16.795 --> 33:20.499
- MR. PETERSEN.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.702
- I WAS EXPECTING--
- SOMEONE ELSE?

33:23.735 --> 33:26.505
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR SPEEDY RECOVERY.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.640
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
IT IS WITH THESE BACK THINGS.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.642
ONE MINUTE YOU CAN'T STAND UP,
THE NEXT MINUTE--

33:30.676 --> 33:33.612
- PLAYING MIXED DOUBLES.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.283
- THIS IS VERY AWKWARD.
[clears throat]

33:37.316 --> 33:39.785
- AWKWARD? THAT YOU COULDN'T
COME OVER TO OUR HOUSE

33:39.818 --> 33:42.121
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?

33:42.154 --> 33:44.356
LINDSAY'S BEEN WORKING
HER ASS OFF FOR YOU.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.192
WOULD IT BE SO FUCKING HARD
TO SHOW UP?

33:46.225 --> 33:49.495
- LANGUAGE.
- LANGUAGE.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.364
- YOUR EXCUSES ARE BULLSHIT.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.133
ALL SHE WANTS FROM YOU

33:54.166 --> 33:55.801
IS TO SHOW HER
A LITTLE SUPPORT.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.070
- THE ONLY REASON YOU WANT US
TO COME TO YOUR PARTY

33:58.104 --> 34:00.172
IS SO THAT WE'LL
WRITE YOU A CHECK.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.541
- NANCY, PLEASE.
- WHY NOT ADMIT IT?

34:02.574 --> 34:06.278
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.380
I'M THE SLICK JEW LAWYER
COME TO SHAKE YOU DOWN

34:08.414 --> 34:11.150
FOR A FEW SHEKELS.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.452
THE DYKE WHO CORRUPTED
YOUR DAUGHTER.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.154
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

34:15.187 --> 34:20.359
I'M LINDSAY'S LOVING PARTNER
AND GUS'S ADORING MOTHER.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.362
AND I KNOW THAT I WILL
NEVER CAUSE HIM THE PAIN

34:23.395 --> 34:25.397
THAT YOU'VE CAUSED HER.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.734
HE'LL NEVER HAVE TO WONDER
WHETHER OR NOT I LOVE HIM.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.403
- ARE WE GONNA TALK?

35:04.436 --> 35:08.874
OR ARE WE JUST GONNA RAKE
THE WHOLE GODDAMN NEIGHBORHOOD?

35:08.907 --> 35:12.744
- IF YOU WANT
TO TALK, TALK.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.148
- YOU KNOW I DIDN'T
MEAN WHAT I SAID.

35:16.182 --> 35:19.718
WELL, FOR IT TO COME OUT
THE WAY IT DID.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.624
I'VE JUST HAD IT
WITH THIS FUCKING DISEASE.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.794
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.563
- I KNOW, BABY.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.670
I JUST CAN'T
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.509
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'LL HAVE TO?

35:43.542 --> 35:46.645
MICHAEL DOESN'T HAVE HIV.
- BEN DOES.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.247
AND THERE'S NOTHING
IN HIS LIFE

35:48.280 --> 35:49.648
THAT'S NOT GONNA
BE AFFECTED BY IT,

35:49.681 --> 35:52.251
INCLUDING MICHAEL.

35:52.284 --> 35:56.622
AND WHAT AFFECTS MICHAEL,
AFFECTS ME.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.924
- IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.827
YOU DON'T JUST GET THEM,
YOU GET THE WHOLE DAMN FAMILY.

36:01.860 --> 36:05.564
- YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT SO CRAZY
ABOUT THE IN-LAWS.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.468
- [chuckles]

36:15.974 --> 36:19.845
- I MEAN, EVEN
IF THEY HAVE SAFE SEX,

36:19.878 --> 36:22.981
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

36:23.014 --> 36:26.685
WHAT IF MICHAEL COMES TO US
AND HE SAYS, "I'VE GOT IT?"

36:30.289 --> 36:32.491
WHAT DO WE DO?

36:35.794 --> 36:38.864
- FIRST WE'D DIE.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.904
AND THEN WE'D DEAL WITH IT.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.720
[chuckles]

37:03.722 --> 37:05.724
- [clears throat]

37:05.757 --> 37:07.926
- THIS PARTY SUCKS.

37:07.959 --> 37:12.331
- I PREFER TO THINK
OF IT AS MELLOW.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.734
- I'M GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND SWALLOW A BOTTLE OF XANAX.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.271
- GOOD IDEA.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.873
- FUCKING FLOWERS ARE MAKING
MY ALLERGIES GO BERSERK.

37:21.907 --> 37:25.344
- OH! WHOOPEE, THAT'S
A GOOD REASON TO LEAVE.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.746
- AND LEAVE ME ALONE
WITH THE LADIES WHO MUNCH?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.681
NO WAY.

37:29.715 --> 37:32.818
- UH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

37:32.851 --> 37:36.021
WE CAN DO.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.790
- YAY!
- [chuckles]

37:41.427 --> 37:43.695
- YOU KNOW, I CAN HONESTLY
SAY THERE IS, UH,

37:43.729 --> 37:46.398
THERE'S NOT ONE THING HERE
I'D PUT IN MY MOUTH.

37:46.432 --> 37:49.501
- THAT'S A FIRST.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.403
- EXCUSE ME?

37:51.437 --> 37:54.039
- THIS FOOD'S THE WORST.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.512
- OH, DID I--DID I TELL YOU,
MICHAEL, THAT I RECEIVED

38:00.546 --> 38:06.685
A VERY VERY LUCRATIVE
OFFER FROM COCKS'R'US.NET?

38:06.718 --> 38:10.522
- WHY, NO, EMMETT, YOU DIDN'T.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.891
- DID I TELL YOU,
MICHAEL, ABOUT MY NEW STAR?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.926
DICK LONG.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.896
NOT ONLY LIVES UP TO,
BUT SURPASSES HIS NAME.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.365
- YOU DON'T SAY.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.099
- YOU CAN TELL,
UH, MR. SCHMIDT,

38:21.132 --> 38:23.802
IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
HIS WIZENED COUNTENANCE,

38:23.835 --> 38:26.805
THAT HE STILL OWES ME
MY LAST PALTRY PAYCHECK.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.807
- AND, UH, YOU CAN
TELL MR. HONEYCUTT,

38:28.840 --> 38:33.345
WHOSE ASS HAS MORE TREADMARKS
THAN A STEEL-BELTED RADIAL,

38:33.379 --> 38:36.081
IF HE DOESN'T COME BY AND
PICK UP HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS,

38:36.114 --> 38:38.417
HIS DILDOES
WILL BE DONATED TO CHARITY.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.918
- WHY DON'T YOU
TELL EACH OTHER YOURSELVES?

38:39.951 --> 38:41.587
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T YOU BOTH APOLOGIZE

38:41.620 --> 38:43.054
FOR ACTING LIKE
A COUPLE OF IDIOTS?

38:43.088 --> 38:44.556
- I'M THE ONE
WHO CREATED HIM.

38:44.590 --> 38:45.824
- YEAH, HE WOULD
BE OUT OF BUSINESS

38:45.857 --> 38:47.359
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.527
- YOU COULD SHOW
A LITTLE GRATITUDE.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.528
- AND YOU COULD SHOW
A LITTLE GENEROSITY.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.463
- AND YOU BOTH COULD SHOW
A LITTLE MATURITY.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.698
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR
GODDAMNED BUSINESS--

38:52.731 --> 38:53.832
- WHO THE FUCK ASKED
YOUR OPINION ANYWAY?

38:53.865 --> 38:55.834
- JUST BUTT OUT!

39:09.147 --> 39:12.851
- [loud slurping]

39:12.884 --> 39:14.853
MMMM.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.956
[knock on door]

39:31.002 --> 39:33.004
ENJOYING THE VIEW?

39:33.038 --> 39:37.476
- GO AWAY.
- MAKE ME.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.545
YOUR PARTY REALLY SUCKS.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.012
- THAT'S ALREADY
BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED,

39:41.046 --> 39:44.149
IF YOU'VE BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION.

39:48.687 --> 39:52.624
- YOU REALLY GIVE
A SHIT WHAT THEY THINK?

39:52.658 --> 39:55.427
- THEY'RE MY PARENTS, BRIAN.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.071
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T CARE.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.775
I SHOULDN'T
LET IT HURT ME.

40:09.808 --> 40:14.212
IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO PLEASE THEM.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.616
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.853
- YOU REMEMBER...

40:21.887 --> 40:24.490
WHAT'S HIS NAME, UM...

40:24.523 --> 40:27.859
BILLY THE ASSHOLE'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY IN JUNIOR YEAR?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.731
- WHEN REBECCA TUCCI
DUMPED ME?

40:32.764 --> 40:35.567
- THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.669
- JEEZ, IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO CHEER ME UP?

40:37.703 --> 40:40.539
[chuckles]
I WAS A WRECK.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.008
- NOT FOR LONG.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.644
- THANKS TO YOU
PUTTING "E" IN THE PUNCH,

40:45.677 --> 40:49.815
SOME LOOSE WOMEN
AND THE B-52'S.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.551
- WELL, THOSE WHO DON'T
LEARN THEIR LESSONS

40:52.584 --> 40:55.654
ARE CONDEMNED
TO REPEAT THEIR COURSES.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.657
[muffled rock music playing]

40:58.690 --> 41:04.596
*

41:04.630 --> 41:08.099
- * ALL WE DID WAS PARTY
EVERY NIGHT AWAY *

41:08.133 --> 41:11.703
* I'M SPINNING IN THE WHEEL
LIKE A GROUNDHOG DAY *

41:11.737 --> 41:15.507
* AT THE FLASHBACK, HONEY

41:15.541 --> 41:17.943
* THE FLASHBACK, YEAH

41:17.976 --> 41:20.746
- COME AND DANCE WITH ME,
BABY.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.280
- * JUST ACROSS THE TRACK

41:22.313 --> 41:25.851
* WHERE EVERYBODY GOES
WHEN THEY'RE FEELING CRACKED *

41:25.884 --> 41:28.119
* CALLED THE FLASHBACK, HONEY

41:28.153 --> 41:30.055
- WHOO!

41:30.088 --> 41:33.559
- * FLASHBACK, YEAH

41:33.592 --> 41:34.660
* DO A LITTLE JUMP

41:34.693 --> 41:37.062
* GOTTA SHAKE IT, SHAKE
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

41:37.095 --> 41:38.930
[laughs]

41:38.964 --> 41:41.032
- DOES THAT OFFER STILL STAND?

41:41.066 --> 41:44.035
- * AT THE FLASHBACK, HONEY

41:44.069 --> 41:48.006
* AT THE FLASHBACK, YEAH

41:48.039 --> 41:50.876
* DANCE WITH EACH OTHER

41:50.909 --> 41:53.178
[laughter]

41:53.211 --> 41:55.781
- WHOO!
- [laughs]

41:57.182 --> 41:59.084
MOM.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.587
DADDY.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.057
- YOU CALL THIS BRUNCH?

42:06.091 --> 42:08.827
- HEY. HOW ABOUT SOME PUNCH?
- MEL, NO.

42:10.328 --> 42:13.632
UH, I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.867
- WE CHANGED OUR MINDS.

42:15.901 --> 42:18.804
AND FROM THE LOOK OF THINGS,
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.739
- HI. HEY.

42:20.772 --> 42:23.074
- WE'RE JUST
HAVING SOME FUN.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.043
- YOU CALL THIS FUN?

42:25.076 --> 42:26.945
- WELL, IT MAY NOT
BE YOUR IDEA OF FUN,

42:26.978 --> 42:30.649
BUT, YES.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.317
- [sighs]

42:32.350 --> 42:34.820
- EVERYONE, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY PARENTS.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.187
[overlapping greetings]

42:36.221 --> 42:38.056
THE GUESTS OF HONOUR.

42:38.089 --> 42:42.761
- YOU NEEDN'T INTRODUCE US.
WE'RE NOT STAYING.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.896
COME ON, RON.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.232
- YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS PARTY WAS TO PROVE

42:47.265 --> 42:50.936
THAT WE'RE JUST LIKE YOU
SO THAT YOU'D ACCEPT US...

42:50.969 --> 42:52.771
THE WAY THAT I'VE TRIED
TO ACCEPT YOU.

42:52.804 --> 42:56.074
- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
I NEEDED TO BE ACCEPTED.

42:56.107 --> 42:59.778
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM,
YOU DON'T.

42:59.811 --> 43:04.115
NEITHER DO WE.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.595
[door closes]

43:20.098 --> 43:23.769
[all chuckling]

43:39.751 --> 43:42.888
- COME FOR MY PERSONAL EFFECTS.

43:47.693 --> 43:51.029
- I HAVE YOUR CHECK.

43:55.333 --> 43:58.203
- I'LL BE AS QUICK AS I CAN.
- EMMETT, I--

43:58.236 --> 44:00.906
- PLEASE, LET'S JUST--
UH, LET'S NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE.

44:00.939 --> 44:05.343
WE'VE BOTH MADE OUR POSITIONS
PAINFULLY CLEAR.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.663
- I, UH...

44:28.900 --> 44:32.137
YOUR FANS ARE GOING
TO MISS YOU.

44:32.170 --> 44:35.741
- WELL, I'M SURE DICK LONG
WILL HELP THEM FORGET.

44:37.408 --> 44:41.012
- AH, WELL, ACTUALLY, HE'S...

44:41.046 --> 44:42.781
ONLY A DICK MEDIUM.

44:46.251 --> 44:49.354
YOU'RE BY FAR
MY BIGGEST ATTRACTION.

44:51.122 --> 44:54.926
- AND I--I SUPPOSE
I DO OWE MY FAME,

44:54.960 --> 44:56.795
SUCH AS IT IS,

44:56.828 --> 45:01.800
AND MY FORTUNE,
SUCH AS IT ISN'T...

45:01.833 --> 45:04.870
TO YOU.

45:08.139 --> 45:10.375
- 5%.

45:10.408 --> 45:13.745
- THAT'S A VERY,
UH, GENEROUS OFFER, TEDDY.

45:13.779 --> 45:16.815
BUT, UM, IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.

45:16.848 --> 45:20.251
I MEAN, FOR ME, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN ABOUT THE ART.

45:30.428 --> 45:33.464
- THE FINEST LUBRICANT.

45:33.498 --> 45:35.767
WATER SOLUBLE.

45:35.801 --> 45:40.205
HEATED TO 98.6 DEGREES.

45:40.238 --> 45:44.509
I--I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,
BUT--

45:52.250 --> 45:55.453
- * I SWEAR,
I'VE NEVER HAD IT BETTER *

45:55.486 --> 45:59.224
* AND WHEN YOU
TREAT ME LIKE THAT *

45:59.257 --> 46:03.328
* YES, I KNOW
THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT *

46:03.361 --> 46:04.963
* YOU'RE THE BEST

46:04.996 --> 46:09.801
- I'M SO SORRY
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

46:09.835 --> 46:13.038
YOU'RE MORE THAN
JUST AN ENORMOUS DICK.

46:15.140 --> 46:18.977
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

46:19.010 --> 46:22.347
- AND YOU'RE MINE.

46:22.380 --> 46:25.283
[squeals]

46:25.316 --> 46:27.418
- * OH, NEVER TAKE ME

46:27.452 --> 46:29.454
* OH, DON'T TAKE ME

46:29.487 --> 46:32.423
* NEVER, EVER
TAKE ME FOR GRANTED *

46:32.457 --> 46:35.293
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

46:35.326 --> 46:39.130
- I'M READY FOR MY CLOSE-UP,
MR. SCHMIDT.

46:39.164 --> 46:41.967
[instrumental climax]

46:42.000 --> 46:45.303
- * THE BEST BAD BOY
I EVER, EVER HAD *

46:49.274 --> 46:52.911
- [panting]

46:58.116 --> 47:01.086
CONDOMS?

47:02.187 --> 47:05.323
- BATHROOM.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.859
- I'LL GET THEM.
- OKAY.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.267
FIND THEM?

47:49.300 --> 47:52.003
- FOUND THEM.

48:10.521 --> 48:12.257
I CAN'T DO THIS.

48:12.290 --> 48:16.627
- HERE. LET ME TRY.

48:16.661 --> 48:20.165
- NO, I MEAN I CAN'T--

48:23.468 --> 48:26.237
I THOUGHT I COULD--

48:26.271 --> 48:27.705
THAT I COULD HANDLE IT,

48:27.738 --> 48:32.443
BUT I GUESS
I WAS JUST FOOLING MYSELF.

48:32.477 --> 48:35.981
I'M SORRY.

48:38.049 --> 48:42.420
- DON'T APOLOGIZE.

48:42.453 --> 48:46.257
IT'S, UH, BETTER
WE FIND OUT NOW.

48:46.291 --> 48:50.595
BEFORE--BEFORE
SOMEONE GETS HURT.

49:10.548 --> 49:13.018
[cabinet door opens]

49:13.051 --> 49:15.120
[box thuds softly]

49:15.153 --> 49:17.989
[departing footsteps]

49:22.327 --> 49:28.033
[clothes rustling]

49:36.707 --> 49:41.079
[door closes and opens]
