WEBVTT

00:50.550 --> 00:54.721
So the top floor has this kind of view.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.557
Is it really okay?

01:00.518 --> 01:02.645
It's your wife's birthday, isn't it?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
Hello.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.107
Hello. Hello.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.240
Your hair's a little longer.

01:20.747 --> 01:25.001
I don't ever let anyone but you touch it.

01:55.073 --> 01:55.907
Sakura.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
Sorry I'm late. Thanks.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.744
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.913
Could you give these to the guests?

02:01.996 --> 02:03.123
SAKURA HIRAGA

02:03.206 --> 02:04.624
- Sure.
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.792
Hello.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.754
Even though it's her birthday.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.590
Does she know
Mr. Hiraga is fooling around?

02:12.674 --> 02:13.842
I'm not sure.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.764
Did you know, only the people
who live on the 15th floor or higher

02:19.848 --> 02:21.474
have been invited to this party?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
We're both lucky to be on the 16th floor.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.397
But really, is she of an age
to have such a flashy birthday party?

02:27.647 --> 02:30.817
- Her husband must love her, I guess.
- Do you think so?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.194
They have no kids.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.446
They could be
in a sexless marriage like us.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.282
There you go again.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.326
Hey. Why don't you sit over here with me?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.579
Thank you very much.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.290
Happy birthday.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.541
Thank you.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.428
Shouldn't you be going to your wife?

02:59.888 --> 03:05.101
A man's wife
is the creature he lusts for the least.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.230
What does he lust for the most then?

03:10.982 --> 03:12.317
Another man's wife.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.636
Why are you home?

03:41.012 --> 03:44.390
I went through the trouble
of asking Mr. Hiraga for an invitation.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.977
It was a chance
for you to make some friends.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.732
If I went, what would I talk about?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.159
We live in different worlds.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.161
SAYA SANADA

04:05.245 --> 04:06.412
Right this way, please.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.876
I'll introduce you. This is Mei.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.296
Mei is a fortune teller,
specializing in feng shui.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.675
We often ask her for advice
when opening new salons.

04:18.758 --> 04:19.801
Please have a seat.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.220
Here you are.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.682
I'd be more than happy
to give you private advice too.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.977
Please come see me anytime.
I'm on the 33rd floor.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.730
I want to have children. What should I do?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.692
- Hey now.
- Why don't you get a pet?

04:35.775 --> 04:40.571
By having something to lovingly care for,
marital relations can improve.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.532
A pet? Like a dog?

04:42.615 --> 04:45.576
From a feng shui perspective,
I recommend a goldfish.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.745
Really? A goldfish?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.873
Goldfish has "gold" in its name,

04:50.957 --> 04:55.128
which, in feng shui,
represents prosperity.

04:56.045 --> 05:01.676
I can also give advice on
male-female concerns outside of marriage.

05:03.011 --> 05:03.886
What?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.514
You mean infidelity?

05:06.597 --> 05:07.974
HISAKO TAGUCHI

05:08.057 --> 05:09.434
It's common.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.270
Not just by husbands, but wives too.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.479
Wives?

05:16.607 --> 05:17.775
Is it strange?

05:19.277 --> 05:22.113
A wife needs a reason to sleep
with a man other than her husband?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.406
YURIHA HAKOZAKI

05:23.489 --> 05:25.366
Women have desires too.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.076
That's true.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.163
With men,
cheating is considered an instinct.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.500
It's nonsense that we must have
some tragic story to justify it, right?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.963
- We should be more free--
- No, absolutely not.

05:40.256 --> 05:45.011
No matter if there's a reason or not,
infidelity is… wrong.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.345
We'd go to Hell.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.931
Hisako, it's just talk.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.684
It's sad that two people

05:51.768 --> 05:55.271
who loved each other
and got married drift apart.

05:55.897 --> 06:01.360
But each person meets their twin ray
in their own time.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.112
Twin ray?

06:03.196 --> 06:07.492
When people are born,
their soul splits in two.

06:07.575 --> 06:11.579
The other half of that soul
is one's twin ray,

06:12.246 --> 06:14.332
truly their destined partner.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.501
How romantic.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.712
If you can meet one of them, obviously.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.381
So has any one of you you met one?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.346
I've already met mine.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.515
Your husband really is wonderful.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.769
That's why I can't even imagine
having an affair.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.219
Mr. Hiraga isn't here yet?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.429
You're kidding me.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.598
I rushed over here.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.601
It's faster to talk to Sakura
if you want to talk business.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.771
Yeah, but that makes me feel…

07:22.066 --> 07:24.277
Mr. Hiraga, congratulations. I--

07:24.360 --> 07:26.320
Hold on. Is this really the time?

07:28.322 --> 07:30.032
That smells wonderful.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.743
It's Molinier's "Gold Rose."

07:37.999 --> 07:39.167
- Sakura.
- What?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.668
- It's about time.
- Okay.

07:49.093 --> 07:53.181
I'd like to thank you all for coming
to celebrate my wife's birthday.

07:54.182 --> 07:59.312
Now, I'd like to present
the gift I've got for her.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.735
We're newly opening a specialized store

08:05.818 --> 08:09.655
to sell the select cosmetic products
used by our salons.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.619
It only sells products,
without offering styling services.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.995
BEAUTY PRODUCT SPECIALTY STORE

08:16.078 --> 08:19.332
It'll be a new challenge for us, but…

08:19.415 --> 08:21.751
Is this why he gathered
all these people together?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.462
Right. It's just for promotion.

08:24.545 --> 08:28.549
They've expanded their salon with
"ideal couple" as their selling point.

08:28.633 --> 08:34.388
Everyone, thank you so much
for joining us on this occasion.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.518
Hand in hand, my husband and I will
endeavor to meet this new challenge.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.396
We humbly ask you all for your support.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
- She's a pro.
- It's their business.

08:46.567 --> 08:50.530
So they'll never split up
no matter what happens.

09:20.935 --> 09:21.936
NEW POST
BIRTHDAY PARTY

09:24.021 --> 09:26.274
MY HUSBAND THREW ME A BIRTHDAY PARTY.
THANKS.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.012
Hey--

09:56.095 --> 09:58.598
Post the photo I sent you on Instagram.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.735
I just did.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.384
It's okay. Don't worry.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.721
Even if you don't work as a stylist,

10:39.930 --> 10:42.433
I want you to keep supporting the salon.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.066
We'll work on it together.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.027
Yeah.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.960
- Let's give it a name.
- Yeah.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.431
TOYODA GOLDFISH

11:33.567 --> 11:35.528
Why don't you get a pet?

11:36.070 --> 11:38.864
By having something to lovingly care for,

11:38.948 --> 11:41.033
marital relations can improve.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.661
I recommend a goldfish.

11:46.497 --> 11:50.167
I guess that would be
asking too much of you guys.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.091
No way. Rain?

11:59.301 --> 12:00.136
What?

12:10.312 --> 12:12.648
Could you… Please!

12:13.607 --> 12:14.442
Sorry!

12:14.525 --> 12:16.527
Could you… What the hell!

12:16.610 --> 12:17.736
Sorry!

12:20.698 --> 12:23.200
I'm so sorry. Here, use this.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.202
I'll pay the cleaning bill.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.037
- You don't have to.
- But--

12:27.121 --> 12:29.748
No, really, it's fine.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.958
It's no problem.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.294
I'm sorry.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.796
It's okay.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.691
- You only have goldfish?
- Yes.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.821
I never knew
there was a shop like this nearby.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.076
What's this one called?

13:47.159 --> 13:50.496
Yeah, it's a type called "sakura ryukin."

13:50.579 --> 13:52.331
Sakura ryukin?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.709
When I first saw it,
it was so weak and blackened.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.127
I thought it was done for.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.673
It's usually such a beautiful goldfish,

14:00.756 --> 14:04.093
but if you keep it in dirty water,
the goldfish becomes dirty too.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.096
Can it get back its beautiful color?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.392
Yes, if you give it
lots of tender loving care.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.149
I'll take this one.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.859
What?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.864
Even if it's a goldfish,
it has the same name as mine.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.365
I somehow can't leave it alone.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.951
The same name?

14:31.328 --> 14:32.413
Sakura?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.418
No? Am I wrong?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.298
It's certainly not ryukin.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.049
Right.

14:45.759 --> 14:46.635
Sakura.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.806
Excuse me.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.480
TAKUYA
GET SOME CIGARETTES

15:00.900 --> 15:03.736
But I'll have to talk it over
with my husband.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.654
I'm sorry.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.699
I'll be back if my husband says yes.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.744
We live in
the high-rise apartment building there.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.288
All right then, I'll be back.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.041
Don't sell it to anybody, okay?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.419
- Sure.
- Bye.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.797
Here. Thanks.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.736
Welcome home.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.701
I'm back.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.790
Do you want something to eat?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.211
I want to ask you something.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.213
I'm tired.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.297
I…

16:06.340 --> 16:07.967
I want a goldfish.

16:09.093 --> 16:09.969
Can I get one?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.721
Do what you want.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.693
She said, "I'll be back."

16:46.547 --> 16:47.631
Okay.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.676
I'll get things ready inside.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.760
Okay.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.395
Okay.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.689
Right, let's have a good day today.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.690
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.360
Yes, you can go ahead
and remove my profile.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.445
HIRAGA OPENS NEW SALON

17:09.528 --> 17:11.238
Make the salon's info bigger.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.532
And your husband's profile?

17:13.615 --> 17:15.284
Leave it as is.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.662
- Understood. I'll change the size.
- Thank you very much. Goodbye.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.183
Sakura.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.935
- The new salon's layout is ready.
- Thank you.

17:42.019 --> 17:42.978
It's looking good.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.397
Yeah, there's a nice feeling
of the open space.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.067
Customers can try the samples,
and strollers can enter too.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.402
- You were particular about that.
- Thanks.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.112
- Yeah.
- It's really looking good.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.655
Yeah, it's cute.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.616
- And here--
- What's this?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.702
The new salon's…

18:00.704 --> 18:02.372
Show it to me first.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.424
I'm sorry.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.218
Don't worry about it.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.722
Welcome.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.234
You wife has noticed, hasn't she?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.152
So what?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.406
Whether she has or not,

18:39.910 --> 18:41.870
she's not going anywhere.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.374
About the goldfish, my husband said yes.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.215
What goldfish need most is clean water.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.594
If you keep it in a small bowl,
change half the water every day.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.929
But tap water is no good.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.600
Let it sit in the sun
to remove the chlorine completely.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.936
Also, drastic temperature changes
cause them a lot of stress.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.523
- The room temperature should--
- Just a sec. It's really difficult.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.943
- What? Is it?
- Yeah.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.822
They look so cute when they're eating,
you get tempted to feed them a lot.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.450
But the leftovers will dirty the water,
so keep an eye--

20:01.533 --> 20:02.576
A goldfish otaku.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.787
I've never seen one before.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.831
Otaku?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.505
Yes, Toyoda Goldfish.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.883
Thank you for your business.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.303
Yes. No, no. Yes.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.557
Thank you, yes.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.863
Need a hand?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.657
What? Can you speak English?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.451
What?

20:45.035 --> 20:46.078
Welcome.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.747
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.879
Kingyo!

21:12.062 --> 21:13.230
Right.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.192
How beautiful.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.528
Thank you so much for today.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.531
Don't mention it.
I should be thanking you.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.448
What?

21:24.825 --> 21:25.826
You see, I…

21:26.326 --> 21:29.204
I help my husband operate a beauty salon,

21:29.288 --> 21:32.291
but I don't get
to interact with customers much.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.001
So…

21:35.752 --> 21:36.837
I was glad.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.843
I felt like I did some real work
after a long time.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.436
All right, I should probably get going.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.230
Any time…

21:56.231 --> 21:57.691
Come back any time.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.036
If the fish gets listless,
come back any time.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.080
Yes.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.882
- There you go.
- Thanks.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.844
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:33.894 --> 22:34.728
Sakura!

22:37.606 --> 22:40.358
Thank you very much for today.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.363
You too!

23:23.902 --> 23:27.447
AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE

24:02.232 --> 24:03.316
Sakura.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.944
Welcome home.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.701
I just came back to change.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.536
I'll make some coffee.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.175
What's this?

24:28.758 --> 24:30.844
It's called a sakura ryukin.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.724
Take it back.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.268
But you told me I could have it.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.020
What are you implying?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.938
Nothing at all, I just--

24:42.022 --> 24:43.398
Are you thinking about

24:45.400 --> 24:47.068
working in our salon again?

24:49.487 --> 24:51.364
It's impossible with that hand.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.496
I know.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.540
It's no use trying to lure away my staff.

25:04.544 --> 25:05.545
I'd never…

25:06.796 --> 25:08.882
I'd never do something like that.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.151
It's your fault. Just do as I tell you.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.706
It hurts.

25:46.836 --> 25:47.754
Are you there?

25:49.547 --> 25:50.632
Sakura?

25:53.593 --> 25:54.844
The goldfish…

25:59.724 --> 26:02.310
Some of its scales came off.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.479
What shall I do if it dies?

26:05.021 --> 26:06.731
- It won't die from that.
- Really?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.400
Give me that salt over there.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.277
- Salt?
- On the shelf there.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.446
Salt. There it is.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.744
- Here, the salt.
- Thank you very much.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.371
A salt water bath.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.791
One liter of water and a teaspoon of salt.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.753
Zero point five percent salt
is best for goldfish.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.380
It's like enhancement.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.014
Don't worry. The scales will grow back.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.559
I'm so glad.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.525
You might be happier here.

26:56.239 --> 27:00.535
FIRST AID KIT

27:00.618 --> 27:01.619
For my hand?

27:02.454 --> 27:05.373
It's a cut from the fishbowl.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.916
But it's totally fine now.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.675
Humans need care too.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.180
Thanks.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.389
No problem.

27:34.861 --> 27:35.695
Sakura.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.324
Do you want to take a ride?

27:41.034 --> 27:41.910
On what?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.961
- It's my first ride.
- Mine too.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.546
- Really?
- Yes.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.590
I've always thought
I could ride any time, so…

28:02.222 --> 28:03.390
I…

28:05.517 --> 28:07.644
I've always thought I wanted to ride.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.358
I'd think, if I rode it,
where would it take me?

28:14.692 --> 28:16.111
But I would always

28:17.821 --> 28:19.948
just stop walking and watch it go.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.173
Come on, stop it. It's embarrassing.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.013
You're not alone.

28:48.184 --> 28:50.311
I'll protect you if anyone comes.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.068
How?

28:57.610 --> 28:59.320
I'll say it was me who shouted.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.905
I see. That's what you meant.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.496
You can't breathe
without letting out all the air first.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.757
I'll always be by your side.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.272
Nicely done!

29:34.355 --> 29:36.274
Do you have anything you want to shout?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.817
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

29:38.401 --> 29:41.029
- A thing I can't say even if I want to.
- What?

29:43.907 --> 29:45.575
I'm hungry!

29:45.658 --> 29:46.910
Stop it!

29:47.494 --> 29:48.578
My turn.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.247
I want to drink a highball!

29:54.209 --> 29:56.586
- At lunchtime?
- It's embarrassing, isn't it?

29:59.088 --> 30:00.924
It feels so good.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.978
- It suddenly started raining.
- It's too sudden, isn't it?

30:14.062 --> 30:15.939
Use this, if you like.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.774
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go!

30:18.525 --> 30:19.567
Thanks.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.610
We'll get wet.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.916
Why were you late for the birthday party?

30:36.084 --> 30:37.377
I forgot why.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.256
Did you do this with Sakura that day too?

30:44.717 --> 30:46.678
- Are you jealous?
- 'Cause…

30:46.761 --> 30:49.848
What's the point in sleeping with a wife
who can't have children?

30:51.015 --> 30:52.016
No point, right?

30:53.101 --> 30:53.935
This is nice.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.062
Matching glasses.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.355
Isn't this nostalgic?

30:59.148 --> 31:01.359
Poor Sakura.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.117
- We'll take these.
- Thank you.

31:10.493 --> 31:11.619
This tastes great.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.787
It's so soft!

31:15.081 --> 31:17.375
- This is great.
- I want to go there.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.252
- That looks delicious.
- Right?

31:20.378 --> 31:23.673
What? Amazing. It's huge.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.008
Amazing. It's huge.

31:26.634 --> 31:30.013
I made you spend the whole day with me.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.806
No, I'm the one who asked you out.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.141
No, it was me.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.518
You want to argue about this?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.312
I don't think so.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.446
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.791
What is it?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.805
Goldfish are tough.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.935
Even if they jump out of the fishbowl,

32:17.018 --> 32:19.187
they have the strength
to be able to swim calmly.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.983
That's what I love about goldfish.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.535
TAKUYA HIRAGA

32:43.086 --> 32:44.629
- I should go home.
- I'll walk you.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.172
No, thank you.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.926
I too have to get tough.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.596
Like a goldfish.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.351
- See you.
- See you.

33:32.802 --> 33:33.886
Good evening.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.179
Good evening.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.058
- Thanks.
- No problem.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.026
So did you find your twin ray?

33:49.402 --> 33:50.486
Twin ray?

33:50.570 --> 33:54.991
The other half of your soul.
Your destined partner.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.032
Welcome home.

34:36.866 --> 34:37.992
I'm back.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.952
You like this kind of food, right?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.914
It was a real chore to order it.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.415
Yeah.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.296
You took back the goldfish.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.758
Good for you.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.595
Come on, let's eat.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.849
I'll go wash my hands.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.101
Just sit down.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.519
Yeah, but…

35:04.602 --> 35:08.689
Why did it take you this much time
just to return a goldfish?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.321
I didn't mention anything like that,
did I?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.743
About the new beauty salon…

35:25.164 --> 35:28.292
I'm making Nene the store manager.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.462
Wait a minute. I'm supposed to…

35:33.631 --> 35:35.299
I'm the one putting up the money.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.262
I can do whatever I want
with what's mine, right?

35:42.306 --> 35:43.558
Hurry up and sit down.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.063
I want to work in a salon then.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.356
Impossible.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.525
Why do you just decide it like that?

35:53.568 --> 35:54.402
What?

35:56.445 --> 35:58.573
Just doing odd jobs or whatever will do.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.783
I want to interact with customers.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.299
Sakura.

36:18.009 --> 36:18.968
Yes.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.850
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- No!

36:28.644 --> 36:30.771
Even though I think so much of you,

36:32.023 --> 36:33.733
why don't you understand?

36:38.070 --> 36:38.988
I love you.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.244
No!

36:45.328 --> 36:46.871
Don't fuck around with me!

36:47.538 --> 36:51.000
Who do you think saved you?

36:51.584 --> 36:54.503
You can't hold a pair of scissors.
You can't have kids.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.506
You're defective,
but I've looked after you this long!

37:01.302 --> 37:04.722
Without me, you're just useless junk!

37:12.605 --> 37:13.898
You're wrong!

37:18.569 --> 37:19.612
I am not…

37:22.281 --> 37:24.075
I am not junk!

37:38.214 --> 37:39.215
Sakura!

38:49.744 --> 38:50.578
Why?

38:53.205 --> 38:54.832
I got worried about you.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.092
I couldn't do it.

39:09.805 --> 39:13.434
I couldn't swim bravely.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.209
I knew it.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.590
I never should have let you go.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.031
You've got nowhere to go anyway.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.002
I envied…

40:27.216 --> 40:28.342
the goldfish.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.097
I also…

40:37.893 --> 40:39.019
wanted…

40:43.315 --> 40:48.529
to be cared for like that by someone.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.897
You can stay here…

41:25.107 --> 41:26.358
until you feel better.
