Cameras rolling. Sound speed.

00:03.804 --> 00:04.641
Action!

00:04.666 --> 00:06.293
Welcome to "Everlasting!"

00:06.318 --> 00:09.625
Now, without further ado,
your suitor, Adam Cromwell!

00:09.650 --> 00:12.500
He's the British heir to
the Cromwell Hotel fortune.

00:12.525 --> 00:14.031
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

00:14.056 --> 00:16.094
Okay, come on. Let's go, people.

00:16.119 --> 00:20.430
You get cash bonuses for
nudity, 911 calls, cat fights.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.549
Aww, why is she crying?

00:22.574 --> 00:25.198
Get me some good TV.

00:25.223 --> 00:27.384
Oh, man! Wow!

00:27.409 --> 00:29.673
- People are going to hate her.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.698 --> 00:32.057
Hello, handsome.

00:32.082 --> 00:33.901
Hi. I'm Faith.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.706
- Cut!
- That's a cut! That's a cut!

00:35.731 --> 00:38.221
That's garbage. I can't
do anything with that.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.666
Go, fix it, now.

00:39.691 --> 00:43.064
- Rachel's the Mystery Freelancer?
- Surprise.

00:43.089 --> 00:46.090
Crazy's back. Don't everybody
rush to hug me at one time.

00:46.115 --> 00:48.095
You're very lucky that your little stunt

00:48.120 --> 00:49.986
got me boo-yah ratings last season.

00:50.011 --> 00:52.041
You could just get the
show to drop the charges.

00:52.058 --> 00:54.225
I need to see that you
have learned from this.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.583
That's funny 'cause right now

00:55.608 --> 00:57.267
it feels a little like blackmail.

00:58.277 --> 00:59.830
Jeremy, I'm sorry that I, um...

00:59.855 --> 01:02.155
That you disappeared without saying a word?

01:02.180 --> 01:03.980
Saw that you and Lizzie got back together.

01:04.004 --> 01:05.477
She's my fiancée.

01:05.864 --> 01:08.097
- I called, Rach.
- Yeah.

01:12.078 --> 01:14.517
If your name is not called,
your fairy tale ends tonight.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.142
I need loser cam on Rodeo Queen,

01:17.167 --> 01:19.424
and I need camera nine
to repo to Evil Britney.

01:19.449 --> 01:20.980
She's gonna win this, people.

01:21.005 --> 01:22.575
Faith.

01:23.592 --> 01:24.724
- What?
- What?

01:24.749 --> 01:26.957
What?!

01:26.982 --> 01:28.649
Screw this!

01:28.674 --> 01:29.973
Cut! Cut!

01:29.998 --> 01:32.793
I can't make a television
show without a villain.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.650
Rachel, there's somebody here to see you.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.098
Flying in.

02:56.123 --> 02:58.020
Did you just call me a slut?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.879
Burn in hell, you witch!

03:00.904 --> 03:03.372
All of you, just burn in hell!

03:03.599 --> 03:06.166
Britney, Britney, Britney.

03:06.191 --> 03:09.137
Perfect bitch and we somehow lost her.

03:09.162 --> 03:11.095
Unbelievable.

03:11.297 --> 03:12.247
Ugh!

03:12.272 --> 03:14.995
Britney hogs Adam at the ballroom dance,

03:15.020 --> 03:18.156
Britney ruins Pepper's
first kiss with Adam.

03:18.181 --> 03:20.910
We built a whole damn season around her,

03:20.935 --> 03:22.713
and I-I need a new villain now.

03:22.738 --> 03:24.249
I have a couple potentials.

03:24.274 --> 03:26.341
That's great. Where is Rachel?

03:26.366 --> 03:27.538
Hmm.

03:28.811 --> 03:30.578
Bethany.

03:30.956 --> 03:33.523
Hey. What's up? Why aren't you in L.A.?

03:33.548 --> 03:36.153
Band's on tour. I guess you
don't check Twitter anymore.

03:36.178 --> 03:39.079
Uh, no. No, I don't. I've
just been a little bit...

03:39.104 --> 03:41.104
Hiding? Well, I tracked you down.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.715
I'm not putting up with
your crap anymore, Goldberg.

03:44.243 --> 03:45.537
You owe me three months' back rent.

03:45.562 --> 03:46.812
Yeah, totally. I understand.

03:46.837 --> 03:48.645
And I, uh... I can get it to you, so...

03:48.670 --> 03:50.569
Too late. I rented out your room.

03:50.734 --> 03:52.206
Are you serious?

03:52.690 --> 03:55.465
Yeah. What'd you expect? You've been M.I.A.

03:55.490 --> 03:56.623
Here's your stuff.

03:56.648 --> 03:58.981
Except for your laptop, that is.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.770
You have 24 hours to pay me or
the MacBook goes on Craigslist.

04:01.795 --> 04:03.176
No. Bethany, no. No, okay?

04:03.201 --> 04:04.708
Listen to me. You
can't... you can't do that.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.325
There's, like, personal things on there.

04:06.350 --> 04:07.372
Look, there's things on there

04:07.397 --> 04:09.097
that could hurt people around here.

04:09.411 --> 04:10.708
So, okay, well, great reason

04:10.733 --> 04:12.585
to get your shit together and pay me.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.842
Hey, Rachel. Adam wants his producer.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.744
He's in his room.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.779
Hey.

04:29.804 --> 04:31.470
Oh, good. You're here.

04:31.495 --> 04:33.817
Uh, I'm out of shaving cream and PG Tips.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.517
- English tea. It's in my contract.
- Okay. All right.

04:37.542 --> 04:40.009
Uh, Adam, let me just explain
something to you, okay?

04:40.034 --> 04:41.884
- Mm-hmm.
- P.A.S fetch things.

04:41.909 --> 04:44.243
Producers produce things.

04:44.268 --> 04:45.298
What does that even mean?

04:45.323 --> 04:46.687
It means that I create conditions

04:46.712 --> 04:49.158
for things to happen and then
I actually make them happen.

04:49.182 --> 04:51.812
So, you're a wizard dressed
as a homeless person,

04:51.837 --> 04:52.548
'cause let's be honest.

04:52.573 --> 04:54.720
Okay.

04:55.349 --> 04:57.633
Just get the P.A.S to
fetch your stuff, all right?

04:57.658 --> 04:59.415
Um, I need you downstairs, like, A.S.A.P.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.827
All right. One second.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.669
I'm so... What are you doing?

05:05.631 --> 05:06.931
Hey.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.892
Yeah, you know what? That
doesn't even intimidate me.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.149
You know why? Because
there's cameras everywhere.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.282
I've seen enough suitor dong

05:12.307 --> 05:15.712
to last me, I would say,
my entire life, so...

05:20.081 --> 05:23.632
That shower looks so good.

05:29.881 --> 05:31.931
No. Do not turn around. Do not look.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.212
- I'm not kidding.
- What?

05:33.237 --> 05:35.916
Keep your eyes shut.

05:38.183 --> 05:39.259
All right.

05:39.284 --> 05:41.525
Keep your eyes shut, or
I am... I will find a way

05:41.550 --> 05:43.478
to double-humiliate you
on national television.

05:43.503 --> 05:45.126
And you know I can, all right?

05:45.151 --> 05:46.584
Okay.

05:48.283 --> 05:50.095
Oh, my God.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.040
Are you... is it... Is this a sex thing?

05:53.065 --> 05:54.743
Oh, God, you wish.

05:54.768 --> 05:56.798
I have never met anyone like you.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.501
What, a homeless wizard?

06:01.439 --> 06:03.339
Oh. All right.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.817
Okay.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.279
Wow, that's amazing.

06:08.304 --> 06:09.497
- Wow, okay.
- Done?

06:09.522 --> 06:11.199
Yep.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.817
And hurry it up.

06:13.842 --> 06:15.801
We need Adam down here right now.

06:15.826 --> 06:17.512
- Yeah, uh...
- We're not gonna make our day.

06:17.537 --> 06:20.192
Copy that. Can somebody
fly in Adam's shaving cream

06:20.217 --> 06:21.950
and make sure that he's got his, uh,

06:21.975 --> 06:24.028
charming, little tips teas on set?

06:24.053 --> 06:25.352
Do not get used to it.

06:25.377 --> 06:26.809
Copy.

06:28.292 --> 06:29.875
Hello, ladies.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.992
Hello.

06:34.168 --> 06:37.489
Now, tonight, at the
"Everlasting" Cinderella ball,

06:37.514 --> 06:39.268
you will all have a chance to show Adam

06:39.293 --> 06:42.661
that you possess poise
and grace and refinement

06:42.686 --> 06:45.717
to accompany him to any royal affair.

06:45.855 --> 06:47.817
Now, to polish up on your footwork, ladies,

06:47.851 --> 06:49.150
we're blessed to have with us

06:49.175 --> 06:51.615
world-famous ballroom-dance instructor

06:51.640 --> 06:53.368
Hernando Montigo.

06:54.269 --> 06:55.702
Uh, hello.

06:55.727 --> 06:56.852
Ohh!

06:56.877 --> 06:58.651
Look who we have here. Prince Charming.

06:58.676 --> 07:00.026
Hello.

07:00.312 --> 07:01.495
Hello, ladies.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.596
Hello!

07:02.621 --> 07:03.690
Hello, ladies.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.227
Uh, I'm looking forward to these lessons.

07:05.252 --> 07:06.956
I think I need them.
Can we, uh... we start?

07:06.981 --> 07:08.520
- Yeah. Let's start.
- All right, let's start.

07:11.426 --> 07:12.625
Hi.

07:12.650 --> 07:13.769
So, which one?

07:13.794 --> 07:15.495
Look who decided to make an appearance.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.145
Why is your hair wet?

07:17.402 --> 07:19.683
Shia, uh, you've got Joy,

07:19.717 --> 07:21.438
the Ruthless Real-Estate Agent, right?

07:21.463 --> 07:23.060
Yeah. I'm gonna starve her out,

07:23.085 --> 07:24.474
get her really, really hangry.

07:24.499 --> 07:26.606
I don't think she's eaten the
whole time she's been here.

07:26.631 --> 07:27.485
Well, if you're talking villains,

07:27.510 --> 07:29.465
why don't you just go Pepper
the Kindergarten Teacher?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.529
I mean, I was with her last
week and she's super sweet,

07:31.553 --> 07:32.988
but I swear to God,

07:33.014 --> 07:35.148
she's got a ball gag
and whip under her bed.

07:35.172 --> 07:37.654
I'd buy it. Shia, go with Pepper.

07:37.894 --> 07:40.686
And, Rachel, I think that, uh,

07:40.711 --> 07:43.743
Anna is your best bet
for the next bad girl.

07:43.768 --> 07:46.083
Anna? No, no way. The girl is super sweet.

07:46.108 --> 07:47.716
She's smart. She's charming.

07:47.741 --> 07:49.700
I need a villain with staying power.

07:49.725 --> 07:50.568
I like the Lawyer.

07:50.593 --> 07:52.326
She's got those Ice-Queen cheekbones.

07:52.351 --> 07:53.847
So see if you can turn her out.

07:53.873 --> 07:56.357
All right, yeah. All right. So,
uh, what are we talking here?

07:56.381 --> 07:58.997
What's it worth? Um, same
bounty as for winner? 10k?

07:59.022 --> 08:01.536
No way. 2 grand.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.893
- $7,000.
- $5,000.

08:05.772 --> 08:07.172
Done.

08:07.197 --> 08:08.372
Game on.

08:08.397 --> 08:10.348
All right, everyone.

08:10.373 --> 08:12.028
Get me some bitch interviews now.

08:12.053 --> 08:13.119
Copy that.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.574
I, uh... I like your necklace.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.622
Oh, this?

08:17.647 --> 08:19.747
My students made it to take with me.

08:19.772 --> 08:21.488
Isn't that sweet?

08:23.100 --> 08:24.757
So, uh, what do you think
of the other girls so far?

08:25.595 --> 08:27.763
They're sweetie pies.

08:27.788 --> 08:30.396
It's so fun to have a big group.

08:30.421 --> 08:31.942
- Uh-huh.
- This is nothing.

08:31.967 --> 08:34.255
Um, hey, is there a reason

08:34.280 --> 08:36.765
that you're doing that
thing with your voice?

08:36.791 --> 08:38.582
The "they're such sweetie pies" thing?

08:38.607 --> 08:40.407
Like, um... Like baby talk.

08:40.943 --> 08:43.640
I wasn't aware I do that.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.015
Oh, I-I wasn't, either,

08:45.040 --> 08:46.706
but then I heard Rita talking about it.

08:46.828 --> 08:48.757
- What?
- Oh, sorry.

08:48.782 --> 08:51.046
Um, her and some of the other girls were...

08:51.178 --> 08:52.890
Were saying that... That it's kind of hard

08:52.915 --> 08:56.216
to imagine you in bed with a man

08:56.351 --> 08:59.178
because... because you
come off like a little girl.

08:59.203 --> 09:01.136
I mean, do you ever get that?

09:01.701 --> 09:03.134
No.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.553
Actually, I don't get that at all.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.561
No one has ever brought
up the baby-voice thing?

09:06.585 --> 09:07.654
Um, no.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.899
So, you met a guy last
night. How did it go?

09:09.923 --> 09:11.544
Why don't you just tell me all about it?

09:11.570 --> 09:15.358
- Okay, well, last night, Adam and I...
- Mm-hmm.

09:15.382 --> 09:19.052
Shared a nice and honest moment.

09:19.077 --> 09:21.233
Ohh. Come on.

09:21.259 --> 09:23.265
Yeah, it was... It was
definitely unexpected.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.757
That's good. That's great.

09:24.782 --> 09:27.148
That's great because, you know,
there were, um... there were

09:27.173 --> 09:30.015
two girls that he said he
felt a spark with, so...

09:30.040 --> 09:31.398
Really?

09:31.423 --> 09:32.388
Yeah.

09:32.413 --> 09:34.234
Uh, so were you surprised,

09:34.259 --> 09:36.367
you know, when things...
When things heated up?

09:36.783 --> 09:41.056
Oh, no, no, no. We didn't
get physical or anything.

09:43.239 --> 09:44.738
Okay. Um...

09:45.591 --> 09:47.069
It must have been the other girl.

09:47.095 --> 09:48.449
Oh, nice one, Goldy.

09:48.474 --> 09:50.489
Uh, what, um...

09:51.409 --> 09:53.023
Who... who was it?

09:53.048 --> 09:55.161
I can't say. She...

09:55.186 --> 09:57.711
But, you know, she's got like a tropical...

09:57.910 --> 10:00.844
A tropical breeze blowing through her hair.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.902
Grace, the... the Model?

10:03.896 --> 10:05.458
Um, I'm sorry.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.784
How... how did she get alone time with him?

10:07.809 --> 10:09.475
That I don't know.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.499
Ah.

10:10.524 --> 10:12.751
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow. Grace.

10:12.776 --> 10:15.641
She's, uh... She's fast.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.208
I just can't stop thinking,

10:17.233 --> 10:19.500
like, really, I passed the bar for this?

10:19.525 --> 10:21.794
That's not bad. That's not bad.

10:21.819 --> 10:24.646
That's good, Rachel. We can cut
something together out of that.

10:24.671 --> 10:25.597
Yeah.

10:25.621 --> 10:28.403
I hate to say this, but you
should probably get back.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.324
- They've been asking for you.
- Oh, damn it.

10:36.347 --> 10:37.814
Wife.

10:37.839 --> 10:39.505
Husband.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.163
What are you doing here?

10:41.188 --> 10:42.149
Did you miss me?

10:42.174 --> 10:44.853
Always. I called.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.159
Oh, my phone, uh, is dead.

10:47.184 --> 10:48.393
Relax.

10:48.418 --> 10:50.050
I just need you to sign these.

10:50.075 --> 10:51.742
Oh, well, you're the boss.

11:00.488 --> 11:01.961
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:01.986 --> 11:04.171
Ugh, God.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.251
I can't believe...

11:05.275 --> 11:07.813
Well, um... Bethany came by.

11:08.194 --> 11:09.664
What, your emo roommate?

11:09.689 --> 11:12.203
- Why?
- Mm, my former emo roommate.

11:12.228 --> 11:14.024
Mm-hmm. Yeah, she rented out my room.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.274
She dropped off all my stuff.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.745
Well, except for my computer,

11:17.770 --> 11:20.336
which she's holding hostage
until I pay her back rent.

11:20.361 --> 11:21.594
You don't need it.

11:22.776 --> 11:24.758
You have no idea what's on there.

11:27.606 --> 11:28.705
Cynthia!

11:28.730 --> 11:29.313
Oh.

11:29.338 --> 11:30.321
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:30.345 --> 11:32.756
Did you, uh, come up
for the Cinderella Ball?

11:32.781 --> 11:33.852
No.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.911
I just came to get Chet
to sign some paperwork,

11:35.936 --> 11:37.673
some new family trust or something.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.596
You know how it is.

11:38.621 --> 11:40.186
Sure. Yeah.

11:40.211 --> 11:42.812
Well, you look incredible as always.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.803
Yeah, you're actually glowing.

11:44.828 --> 11:49.430
Do you... are you doing
fraxel or yoga, or what is it?

11:49.571 --> 11:51.037
I'm pregnant.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.883
Holy shit.

11:53.908 --> 11:55.539
Yeah.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.312
That's what I said.

11:57.337 --> 11:58.680
Congratulations.

11:58.705 --> 11:59.804
Yeah.

12:00.133 --> 12:03.367
Wow. That's, um... I mean, surprise!

12:03.392 --> 12:05.367
Yeah, surprise, indeed. Really.

12:06.695 --> 12:08.922
Wow. That's great.

12:08.947 --> 12:10.305
Quiet. Rehearsal's up.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.430
Um, oh, that's actually... That's for me.

12:13.455 --> 12:14.756
- Okay.
- Okay, I got to go.

12:14.781 --> 12:16.031
Yeah. It was so great seeing you.

12:16.056 --> 12:17.211
You too. Okay.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.569
Oh, my God.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.264
Ladies.

12:22.312 --> 12:25.031
Okay, listen. I'm just
gonna level with you.

12:25.405 --> 12:26.704
Have either of you ever seen

12:26.729 --> 12:28.462
a black girl win one of these shows?

12:28.487 --> 12:30.774
Has one even made it into the final four?

12:30.806 --> 12:32.281
Twice in 13 seasons,

12:32.306 --> 12:34.363
but there's only one way
they make it that far.

12:34.388 --> 12:36.117
Don't say what I think you're about to say.

12:36.142 --> 12:39.867
Honey, believe me, it pains my black soul,

12:39.892 --> 12:41.759
but you deserve the truth.

12:42.403 --> 12:45.375
Omarosa. Nene Leakes.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.584
You've got to go big, okay?

12:47.610 --> 12:49.911
Loud and highly opinionated.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.735
I didn't go to Spelman and
Clerk for a Supreme Court Justice

12:52.760 --> 12:55.875
to end up some Ratchet Hoochie on TV.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.180
I deserve to be here.

12:57.205 --> 12:59.250
I-I want to be in the final
four because of who I am.

12:59.275 --> 13:02.578
Hell, I just want people to know my name.

13:02.603 --> 13:04.470
So when I open my hair shop,

13:04.495 --> 13:07.060
there will be a line around the block.

13:07.085 --> 13:10.319
Athena it is. Stay classy.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.922
You, come with me, please.

13:12.947 --> 13:14.474
We have got some work to do, girl.

13:14.499 --> 13:17.262
All right. How did the
bitch hunt go, everyone?

13:17.288 --> 13:18.727
Athena's game.

13:18.752 --> 13:20.282
Good. Goldy?

13:20.306 --> 13:22.289
Looked like you were
getting someplace with Anna.

13:22.314 --> 13:23.859
Yeah, I think it's gonna be tough.

13:23.885 --> 13:25.501
You know, she's smart and guarded,

13:25.525 --> 13:27.118
so, uh, in short... Maybe.

13:27.143 --> 13:28.891
Well, I got in Pepper's head.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.406
I think she'll give us something.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.163
Hi, uh, sorry.

13:32.188 --> 13:35.125
The production office just got
a call from Anna Martin's aunt.

13:35.150 --> 13:37.966
Her father's in the I.C.U.
He had a heart attack.

13:37.992 --> 13:38.991
Ugh.

13:39.016 --> 13:40.599
Well, there goes your maybe.

13:40.624 --> 13:44.235
Oh, come on. You guys,
you've read her file.

13:44.267 --> 13:45.602
Her dad has a crap heart.

13:45.627 --> 13:47.627
He'll be fine. And look at her.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.348
Just let her have some fun.

13:54.227 --> 13:56.000
I mean, but it's the I.C.U.

13:56.025 --> 13:57.557
We're gonna say something, right?

13:57.582 --> 14:00.266
No. She'll get all
emotional and want to leave.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.258
They always do.

14:01.283 --> 14:04.459
So, I say leave your conscience
at the door on this one.

14:04.484 --> 14:05.783
Okay?

14:05.808 --> 14:07.899
Yes. Yeah, you're right. I will.

14:07.924 --> 14:09.157
Thanks.

14:25.543 --> 14:28.110
Look, I will tell Anna about her
dad first thing in the morning.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.016
None of my business. Yeah,
but you have that look.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.313
- This look?
- Yeah.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.175
No, no, no, no. No, see, this look is,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.133
"please, God, don't let
Rachel freak out again

14:35.158 --> 14:37.419
and bring the show down with
her 'cause I need my job."

14:37.444 --> 14:40.178
Okay, come on. You hate
this job as much as I do.

14:41.226 --> 14:42.456
Not anymore.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.781
There you are, babe.

14:43.806 --> 14:45.105
- Hey.
- I was looking for you.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.312
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

14:46.493 --> 14:47.692
It's lunch time.

14:47.717 --> 14:49.584
Okay. Just got to pack up some stuff.

14:49.609 --> 14:50.741
Okay.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.366
Get along, little doggy.

14:52.745 --> 14:54.077
Starving.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.938
I don't know how you guys do it.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.604
Yeah, I, um, I ju...

14:59.629 --> 15:01.329
Lizzie, I just wanted to apologize,

15:01.353 --> 15:02.789
you know, about that footage and all.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.833
No, no. There's no need to explain.

15:04.859 --> 15:06.459
I knew about you guys already.

15:06.714 --> 15:09.641
And Jeremy told me what
a huge mistake it was

15:09.666 --> 15:11.610
for both of you.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.346
Right. Okay.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.577
How are you doing now?

15:14.602 --> 15:15.961
Uh...

15:15.986 --> 15:18.820
He said that you'd been
through a lot and...

15:19.079 --> 15:21.713
Look, I just want you to know
that if you need anything,

15:21.963 --> 15:25.209
like anything at all,
we're both here for you.

15:25.556 --> 15:27.753
Um...

15:38.817 --> 15:41.489
Congratulations.

15:41.513 --> 15:44.247
Oh, it's a baby.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.721
Were you not going to tell me?

15:47.746 --> 15:50.001
I was. It's not what it looks like.

15:50.026 --> 15:52.305
No? Because it seems like

15:52.330 --> 15:55.907
I just got 18 years added to my sentence.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.231
Cynthia is old, and she's dried up,

15:58.256 --> 16:00.356
and we weren't thinking.
It was an accident.

16:00.381 --> 16:02.477
She is two years older than me,

16:02.502 --> 16:05.610
and you said that you
never had sex anymore.

16:05.634 --> 16:08.268
Hardly ever. I don't
even know that it's mine.

16:08.293 --> 16:10.805
Maybe it won't even stick. It's very early.

16:10.830 --> 16:13.008
So, I'm supposed to hang around

16:13.033 --> 16:17.639
and hope that your wife is a
slut or that she miscarries?

16:17.663 --> 16:18.763
No.

16:18.788 --> 16:22.556
No, I-I-I am done being the side-wife,

16:22.581 --> 16:24.884
and I am not waiting for you anymore.

16:24.910 --> 16:25.442
Quinn.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.382
Screw this and screw you.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.164
You know, I danced with him once,

16:40.189 --> 16:42.328
- but we haven't even gotten to talk.
- Oh.

16:42.353 --> 16:45.154
So, what, you're just gonna let
the girl who went down on him win?

16:45.179 --> 16:47.201
She did that?

16:47.510 --> 16:49.326
Oh, my God.

16:49.351 --> 16:50.438
I know.

16:50.463 --> 16:54.398
I mean, for once, I would like
to see somebody deserving win.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.231
Why don't you do it?

16:56.256 --> 16:58.526
You know, push her out of the way?

16:58.551 --> 17:02.106
Play the game. Play the game.

17:02.571 --> 17:03.837
Uh... okay.

17:03.862 --> 17:05.028
Yeah.

17:05.053 --> 17:07.153
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.869
- Cameras on Anna.
- Copy.

17:14.672 --> 17:16.037
Excuse me, Grace.

17:16.061 --> 17:18.256
Uh, could I speak with you for a second?

17:18.281 --> 17:19.182
Sure.

17:19.207 --> 17:20.573
Oh. One second, Adam.

17:20.598 --> 17:22.271
- Yeah.
- What's up?

17:22.297 --> 17:25.176
Uh, there's just this...
This rumor that you, um...

17:25.202 --> 17:26.935
That what?

17:34.650 --> 17:38.886
That you are such a good dancer.

17:39.888 --> 17:42.746
And you're so pretty.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.845
Thank you. Thanks.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.209
Yeah. Um, sorry.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.119
Okay.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.092
- So that was kind of a fail. What happened?
- Yeah.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.951
Well, I realized I was about

17:56.976 --> 17:59.318
to slut-shame a woman
on national television,

17:59.344 --> 18:03.736
and I'm just... I'm not about that.

18:06.220 --> 18:08.554
Okay, you're probably
not gonna believe this,

18:08.579 --> 18:10.379
but I'm not, either.

18:10.404 --> 18:14.373
Here. I need to talk to
you for one second, okay?

18:14.398 --> 18:16.694
Okay, look. Um...

18:17.161 --> 18:19.683
Your dad had a heart thing this morning.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.138
He's in the I.C.U. He's okay.

18:22.164 --> 18:23.772
Your brother's with him.

18:23.797 --> 18:27.592
Wait. Whoa. Wh-what do
you mean, a heart thing?

18:27.617 --> 18:30.225
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.342
I have to go home. My
brother is 16 years old.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.561
Yeah. I-I just need you to stay
for the elimination ceremony.

18:34.586 --> 18:37.569
The elimination ceremony?
My dad could be dying.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.999
I'm just asking about a
few more hours here, okay?

18:41.247 --> 18:43.014
You know, I-I can have him pick you first.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.069
We can have, um...

18:44.094 --> 18:46.210
We can get a car waiting
for you right outside.

18:46.234 --> 18:48.878
I mean, please. I wasn't even
supposed to tell you today.

18:50.014 --> 18:53.079
And there is this clause in your contract.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.535
Okay.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.311
But will you please text my brother

19:00.336 --> 19:01.689
and let him know that I'm coming?

19:01.714 --> 19:04.108
Yes. Great. Yes.

19:06.216 --> 19:09.517
Somebody get me Quinn now.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.442
Quinn's door is locked.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.623
Okay. I really don't
care th-that she's busy.

19:13.648 --> 19:14.947
Just knock on the door.

19:14.972 --> 19:16.839
Copy.

19:19.615 --> 19:21.253
Damn.

19:24.604 --> 19:26.371
Anna?

19:33.401 --> 19:37.370
Anna's gone over the
wall. We've got a runner.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.150
What?

19:53.175 --> 19:55.325
Oh, you think Quinn's letting
you rescue Anna without a camera?

19:55.351 --> 19:57.085
Let's go.

19:58.649 --> 20:01.183
Jay, I need these girls
all moony-eyed and glowing.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.607
I need princess-fantasy
footage out the ass.

20:03.632 --> 20:04.864
Done.

20:15.602 --> 20:17.309
Great.

20:17.334 --> 20:18.567
Adam's with Mary dancing

20:18.592 --> 20:20.540
to the beat of 5 million remotes clicking

20:20.565 --> 20:22.902
to someone hotter, hipper, and wetter.

20:22.928 --> 20:24.961
Just do something. Blow it up.

20:24.986 --> 20:27.440
No word about Anna. Not yet.

20:31.326 --> 20:34.160
- Did you see where she went?
- Mnh-mnh, no.

20:34.186 --> 20:36.576
But runners always head to the main road.

20:36.663 --> 20:38.596
Adam.

20:38.621 --> 20:40.470
Oh, hello...

20:40.495 --> 20:41.384
Pepper.

20:41.409 --> 20:43.676
Pepper. Hi. How you doing?

20:43.992 --> 20:47.267
Uh, some people have
been saying some things

20:47.292 --> 20:48.758
that you may have heard,

20:48.981 --> 20:52.370
that... that I... I
don't act like a grown-up

20:52.395 --> 20:55.628
and that I'm not, you know, experienced.

20:55.653 --> 20:56.687
No, not at all.

20:56.712 --> 21:00.987
I mean, y-you seem like a
lovely adult woman to me.

21:02.471 --> 21:06.373
I am, and I want to prove that to you.

21:06.398 --> 21:09.032
Okay. Great.

21:16.214 --> 21:18.314
I want you to cut Rita tonight.

21:18.339 --> 21:19.906
Heard she's been slamming me.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.397
I'll make it worth your while.

21:21.422 --> 21:22.268
Who's Rita?

21:22.293 --> 21:23.420
I promise.

21:23.445 --> 21:27.740
Um... okay.

21:27.765 --> 21:30.245
Great.

21:32.503 --> 21:35.638
She's around here somewhere.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.284
- 9:00.
- All right.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.385
I'm not good at that at all.

21:47.410 --> 21:48.845
Sorry. Can I steal this one from you?

21:48.877 --> 21:51.174
- Oh, sorry.
- Sure. No, no, no. He wants you.

21:51.199 --> 21:52.479
- Oh.
- Hi.

21:52.504 --> 21:53.637
- Hi!
- How's it going?

21:53.662 --> 21:54.794
It's...

21:54.819 --> 21:55.952
- Going good?
- Yeah.

21:55.977 --> 21:57.109
Yeah.

21:57.134 --> 21:58.597
Oh, my gosh.

21:58.622 --> 21:59.925
There you go. Look at that.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.184
Come on.

22:02.209 --> 22:04.573
- "B" and "C" cam, do your thing.
- Copy.

22:04.598 --> 22:07.764
Here we go. Watch my bitch dominate.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.464
- Ow! Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

22:09.489 --> 22:10.933
Ooh, are you okay?

22:10.958 --> 22:12.199
She stepped on my foot.

22:12.223 --> 22:14.096
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:14.122 --> 22:15.831
You need to watch where you're going.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.503
Oh, I thought I was.

22:17.528 --> 22:20.651
But, you know, I got two left feet, so...

22:20.676 --> 22:22.221
What do you mean by that?

22:22.247 --> 22:25.238
Uh, well, it's... I don't know.

22:25.263 --> 22:27.581
- You're obviously a better dancer than me, so...
- Why?

22:27.606 --> 22:29.606
Because only black people have rhythm?

22:29.631 --> 22:30.797
What?

22:30.822 --> 22:33.003
No. Not at all.

22:33.028 --> 22:34.222
That's not what I said.

22:34.247 --> 22:37.245
Where I come from it's all
about hoedowns and hootenannies.

22:37.270 --> 22:39.698
Right, and on the other side of town,

22:39.723 --> 22:42.854
we be twerkin' and crunkin'
and eating watermelon.

22:42.879 --> 22:44.679
No, I did not say that.

22:44.704 --> 22:46.838
Half the kids in my high school were black.

22:46.864 --> 22:48.576
I had a lot of black friends.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.335
Do not say, "some of my
best friends were black."

22:51.360 --> 22:53.393
You know that's what racists say.

22:53.418 --> 22:54.667
I am not a racist.

22:54.692 --> 22:57.253
And that's the other thing they say.

22:57.278 --> 22:59.214
I did not come here to be disrespected!

22:59.239 --> 23:00.902
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:00.927 --> 23:02.073
Let's, uh, let's... Okay.

23:02.098 --> 23:05.134
Let's, um... let's get
you a drink over here.

23:05.579 --> 23:07.479
I didn't do anything.

23:11.788 --> 23:13.983
Nice work, Uncle Tom.

23:19.901 --> 23:22.635
She's got to be inside.

23:22.660 --> 23:29.965
♪ Tippin' back the old
bottle till it's gone ♪

23:33.202 --> 23:36.389
- Thanks.
- You need to call anyone else?

23:36.414 --> 23:40.282
♪ Drown your pain in homemade sauce ♪

23:40.307 --> 23:44.876
♪ sing your sad, sad
songs until the dawn ♪

23:45.718 --> 23:48.052
Anna, hey.

23:50.195 --> 23:53.977
Okay, look. Um... I know you're upset.

23:55.016 --> 23:58.884
But I promise you... I'm gonna help you.

23:58.909 --> 24:01.844
Okay? I'm gonna get you
home to see your dad.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.820
I didn't say goodbye.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.054
Goodbye?

24:14.570 --> 24:17.343
He's dead.

24:29.136 --> 24:31.751
Just go away. Leave me alone.

24:31.791 --> 24:33.958
Just go away. Leave me alone.

24:33.977 --> 24:36.124
You just... You just can't stay here, okay?

24:36.149 --> 24:38.491
- Let me take you back so we can...
- Screw you!

24:38.516 --> 24:40.488
I am so...

24:40.513 --> 24:43.923
Look. I am so, so sorry.

24:44.115 --> 24:47.349
I can't even imagine what
you're going through right now.

24:48.711 --> 24:52.659
And I'm just... I'm worried about you.

24:55.968 --> 24:58.435
You know, what happened to your shoes?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.921
Go to hell.

25:14.592 --> 25:16.228
I need to go home.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.508
I know. I know.

25:19.216 --> 25:21.700
And I'm gonna make that happen.

25:21.725 --> 25:24.227
On my life.

25:35.849 --> 25:38.861
So, Pepper, what happened tonight?

25:38.886 --> 25:40.119
Oh!

25:40.144 --> 25:43.212
My heart skipped a beat
when Adam kissed me.

25:43.237 --> 25:46.172
We, um, have a real connection now.

25:46.891 --> 25:48.799
So, why don't you tell me

25:48.823 --> 25:52.058
what you think happened earlier tonight?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.669
Uh, well...

25:54.765 --> 25:57.204
I think, um...

25:58.268 --> 26:00.477
I really do have a lot of black friends.

26:00.502 --> 26:03.298
- African... black friends.
- Yeah.

26:03.323 --> 26:05.142
African-American friends.

26:05.067 --> 26:09.302
And I'm a Christian, so I
don't... I don't hate anybody.

26:19.056 --> 26:20.977
- Go.
- Yeah, we got her.

26:21.002 --> 26:22.830
- How is she?
- Uh, not good.

26:22.855 --> 26:24.260
She's hurt pretty bad, all torn up.

26:24.284 --> 26:26.417
Nice. Give me eight minutes. I'll be ready.

26:26.442 --> 26:28.173
Quinn?

26:30.316 --> 26:32.744
Coming up on "Everlasting,"

26:32.769 --> 26:36.638
Adam makes a special connection
with his perfect woman

26:36.663 --> 26:38.252
- only to discover...
- Call the fire department.

26:38.277 --> 26:39.603
Tell them one of the girls collapsed.

26:39.628 --> 26:40.931
We need an ambulance now.

26:40.956 --> 26:43.533
Um, okay, but last time, they
said no more false alarms.

26:43.558 --> 26:44.703
Not my problem.

26:45.884 --> 26:48.197
Hey, I don't want to... I
don't want to see anyone, okay?

26:48.222 --> 26:50.255
You don't have to. You don't have to, okay?

26:50.280 --> 26:51.884
It's over. It's over.

26:51.909 --> 26:55.150
I want Adam and all the
girls in the driveway now.

26:55.175 --> 26:56.150
Copy.

26:56.175 --> 26:58.311
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go!

26:58.609 --> 27:01.986
Come on. Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Pick up the pace!

27:02.011 --> 27:05.814
Everybody, finishing touches!
Dresses down, boobs out!

27:05.839 --> 27:07.736
Semicircle. Let's go, let's go!

27:07.761 --> 27:09.533
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

27:09.558 --> 27:11.127
I need sad faces, okay?

27:11.151 --> 27:13.518
Your puppy died, your
implants got infected.

27:13.543 --> 27:16.360
I don't care. Just use
it. Sad faces. Let's go!

27:16.386 --> 27:18.375
Everybody, on channel seven now.

27:20.085 --> 27:22.580
I need a phone. Could I use your phone?

27:22.704 --> 27:24.447
I need to call my brother.

27:24.472 --> 27:26.170
He's not gonna know what to do.

27:26.202 --> 27:27.400
Crap. You know what?

27:27.425 --> 27:30.095
I, uh... I left my phone back at the house.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
Let... let's get your cuts taken care of

27:32.145 --> 27:34.078
and we will get you a phone, okay?

27:40.424 --> 27:42.095
What is all this?

27:42.450 --> 27:44.337
Oh, my God.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.445
You don't care about me getting home.

27:46.470 --> 27:48.101
You bitch.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.994
Get that out of my face.
Just leave me the hell alone.

27:51.019 --> 27:52.575
Anna. Anna, Anna, we just need... Anna...

27:52.600 --> 27:53.932
Oh, you need?

27:53.957 --> 27:55.634
Look, I don't care what you need, okay?

27:55.659 --> 27:57.771
You lied to me about everything.

27:57.797 --> 28:01.723
All you care about is this
hideous, soul-sucking show.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.449
No! God!

28:05.474 --> 28:09.615
You all deserve to burn in hell.

28:16.298 --> 28:17.440
Anna.

28:17.465 --> 28:19.080
Get away from me.

28:20.618 --> 28:22.830
Jeremy, stop. Seriously. Camera down.

28:22.855 --> 28:24.018
Jeremy, stop.

28:30.545 --> 28:32.455
Do you want me to come with you?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.680
Thanks, I got it.

28:37.935 --> 28:40.111
Get those footprints.

28:54.928 --> 28:57.085
Hey, uh...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.583
So, I got my boss to
agree to the private jet.

28:59.608 --> 29:00.958
We can get you home tonight.

29:00.983 --> 29:03.669
- Great. Thanks. I quit, by the way.
- Anna, Anna, look.

29:03.694 --> 29:05.227
Just

29:05.252 --> 29:06.986
Look, if you don't let
me tell your whole story,

29:07.011 --> 29:09.311
I just... I can't guarantee
what story the show will tell.

29:09.336 --> 29:11.270
Like I give a damn. God.

29:11.771 --> 29:13.732
They're gonna sue you for breach of...

29:13.757 --> 29:15.162
So sue me then, okay?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.764
Sue the girl whose dad just died.

29:19.287 --> 29:23.114
You know, I thought that
you were an actual person.

29:26.584 --> 29:29.326
All right. Four cameras. I need footage.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.599
Tears, emotions, and we
can milk the tragedy angle.

29:31.624 --> 29:33.377
No, no, no. She said no
cameras at the funeral.

29:33.402 --> 29:35.615
Look, I get that she's upset, but...

29:35.640 --> 29:38.131
She's a Lawyer. If we
overplay this, she's gone.

29:38.155 --> 29:39.777
And I need Adam.

29:39.803 --> 29:42.631
No. Anna, she wants to quit.
She doesn't trust me anymore.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.637
I think that he's the only
one who can get her back.

29:44.662 --> 29:47.436
Great. So, no suitor in
the house and no cameras.

29:47.461 --> 29:51.732
Stellar work, Goldberg.
You've really outdone yourself.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.673
When my dad got sick,

30:01.698 --> 30:05.033
he came to stay with me and my brother.

30:05.058 --> 30:07.416
- And, honestly, it was...
- You can't help yourself, can you?

30:07.441 --> 30:09.935
- Just hard.
- You're physically itching to film this?

30:10.921 --> 30:14.490
But before I left, just...
just for a few days,

30:14.515 --> 30:17.671
he got back all of these memories,

30:17.696 --> 30:20.863
mostly of Terry and me when we were kids.

30:20.888 --> 30:23.122
I mean, he was my hero.

30:25.288 --> 30:28.323
Hey, uh, Chet wants to see you out front?

30:28.831 --> 30:31.456
Tell him I'm busy.

30:36.123 --> 30:37.723
What?

30:37.748 --> 30:39.689
I just... I really don't
think I should tell him that

30:39.714 --> 30:42.314
because I really like working here.

30:43.578 --> 30:46.913
Just go. Get out of here.

30:54.552 --> 30:56.146
- Hey.
- Save it, Chet.

30:56.171 --> 30:57.693
Okay, I said everything I'm gonna say.

30:57.718 --> 30:59.373
Okay. But I have something
for you. Come here.

30:59.398 --> 31:00.271
No. Hell no.

31:00.296 --> 31:03.388
You are not going to gift your
way out of this, all right?

31:03.413 --> 31:06.161
This is the apocalypse,
man. This is end of days.

31:06.187 --> 31:08.662
Okay. You know, the baby's
a trap for me, too, okay?

31:08.687 --> 31:11.221
You are never going to leave her,

31:11.246 --> 31:13.246
and yesterday made that very clear.

31:13.271 --> 31:14.932
Then why did I do this?

31:16.591 --> 31:18.764
I'm building it for us.

31:18.826 --> 31:21.292
Top of mullholland with a view.

31:22.959 --> 31:26.083
His-and-her offices,
his-and-her shower,

31:26.108 --> 31:27.852
his-and-her bedroom
like we talked about...

31:27.878 --> 31:29.002
Keep the mystery alive.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.551
Chet.

31:30.576 --> 31:32.276
It'll be ready in September.

31:32.301 --> 31:33.600
And guess what.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.626
It's yours. Free and clear.

31:36.651 --> 31:38.517
What, to live in alone?

31:38.542 --> 31:40.747
I'm gonna put in a deluge shower.

31:42.015 --> 31:46.171
I don't want a deluge shower, Chet.

31:48.190 --> 31:50.086
Hi.

31:50.255 --> 31:51.642
Hey.

31:51.667 --> 31:54.708
Your eulogy was so lovely.
It... it really struck a chord.

31:54.733 --> 31:56.513
Thank you.

31:56.791 --> 31:59.737
Listen... uh, I know what a difficult time

31:59.762 --> 32:01.229
you're going through right now.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.333
Um, but sometimes it can
help to take your mind of it,

32:03.358 --> 32:06.692
and I would love to help with that.

32:07.663 --> 32:09.724
How very British of you.

32:09.749 --> 32:12.240
Just don't think about it.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.295
Okay, yeah, cool.

32:13.319 --> 32:14.647
Yeah.

32:14.673 --> 32:16.416
But I would like to help with you.

32:16.441 --> 32:17.984
Truly.

32:21.211 --> 32:23.639
I can't. I'm sorry.

32:23.874 --> 32:25.630
I-I have to take care of my brother.

32:25.655 --> 32:27.266
I'm all he has now.

32:27.291 --> 32:28.890
I know. Of course.

32:28.915 --> 32:31.074
I understand.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.818
Yeah, not gonna happen.

32:39.843 --> 32:41.410
Wait. Excuse me. What?

32:41.435 --> 32:43.153
She's not gonna leave her brother

32:43.449 --> 32:45.782
'cause she's actually a decent person.

32:45.807 --> 32:47.741
You know what? Screw it.

32:47.766 --> 32:51.367
It's fine. I'll take the
heat. It's horrifying.

32:51.392 --> 32:54.527
Wait. Hang on. There might be another way.

32:59.986 --> 33:01.568
Uh, uh, Terry.

33:01.593 --> 33:02.993
Terry, right? You're Anna's brother?

33:03.018 --> 33:04.684
Yeah, hi. I-I'm Rachel. And this is...

33:04.709 --> 33:06.366
You're the guy from the show.

33:06.391 --> 33:08.404
- Yes. Adam Cromwell.
- There you go.

33:08.429 --> 33:09.443
I'm sorry about your dad.

33:09.468 --> 33:11.635
- Yeah, well, some timing, huh?
- Yeah.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.761
Look, um... I really like your sister.

33:14.788 --> 33:16.201
I think she's a fascinating person.

33:16.226 --> 33:17.435
And I'm genuinely intrigued...

33:17.460 --> 33:19.726
No offense, but I don't
buy any of this crap.

33:19.751 --> 33:23.297
Okay, so, uh, Terry, here's the deal, okay?

33:23.322 --> 33:26.706
Um, Adam's super rich, and
he's super into your sister.

33:26.731 --> 33:28.898
Okay, and I'm not even
supposed to be telling you this,

33:28.923 --> 33:31.302
but your sister has a real
shot at winning this thing.

33:31.327 --> 33:35.561
I'm talking $200,000, maybe
more if he ends up marrying her.

33:36.775 --> 33:38.665
Just give it a think.

33:38.690 --> 33:40.841
- What the hell, Rachel?
- Oh, hi.

33:40.866 --> 33:43.099
Is she trying to get me back on the show?

33:43.462 --> 33:45.930
No. I am.

33:46.207 --> 33:47.406
What?

33:47.431 --> 33:49.331
Adam really likes you.

33:49.356 --> 33:51.456
You won't find a guy like that here.

33:51.481 --> 33:53.499
That's why you came on the show, remember?

33:53.524 --> 33:55.380
Why bail now?

33:55.405 --> 33:57.138
Where would you go?

33:57.163 --> 34:00.169
I'll stay with Aunt Ruth.
It's six weeks. I'll be fine.

34:00.194 --> 34:02.261
It's over. Dad's gone.

34:02.286 --> 34:05.387
Just go. Really.

34:05.412 --> 34:07.964
Kind of hard to argue with that.

34:15.194 --> 34:17.460
Come back with me, Anna.

34:25.007 --> 34:26.449
Okay.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.241
Yeah?

34:28.266 --> 34:28.982
Yeah.

34:29.007 --> 34:30.739
Okay.

34:34.018 --> 34:36.271
That's got to be worth an Xbox.

34:38.254 --> 34:41.083
One sec, Terry. Hold on one second.

34:41.108 --> 34:43.317
Uh, hello?

34:43.342 --> 34:46.724
24 hours is up. Where's my money?

34:46.748 --> 34:49.949
Yeah, no. I'm getting it. I'm... I'm
in the midst of getting it to you.

34:49.975 --> 34:51.773
I'm just kind of in this
complicated work with...

34:51.799 --> 34:52.763
Stop.

34:52.788 --> 34:55.029
How many times do you think
I'll fall for your crap, Rachel?

34:55.054 --> 34:57.318
I don't know. I'm hoping once more.

34:57.343 --> 34:58.675
No.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.815
No? No. Okay.

35:01.387 --> 35:04.199
You weren't kidding about
all that personal stuff.

35:05.508 --> 35:09.412
I read your unsent sappy
love e-mail to Jeremy.

35:09.437 --> 35:11.645
Is it a marriage proposal or soft-core

35:11.670 --> 35:14.704
'cause I can't even tell?

35:17.154 --> 35:19.317
Not very nice about his girlfriend Lizzie.

35:19.342 --> 35:21.275
Bethany, stop. Stop.

35:21.300 --> 35:25.869
Oh, I also found the
crew list to your show.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.573
$3,900, Rach,

35:28.598 --> 35:31.293
or your heart barf goes
live to all of them.

35:31.318 --> 35:33.725
No, Bethany, stop. Listen to me, okay?

35:33.750 --> 35:35.950
Jeremy is engaged to
Lizzie now. He's very happy.

35:35.975 --> 35:37.373
I've already messed up his life once.

35:37.398 --> 35:38.857
I would prefer not to do it again.

35:38.882 --> 35:42.279
Easy solution... Pay me by 10:00 P.M.

35:42.304 --> 35:44.610
I sent you a PayPal link.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.686
Hello, everybody. It's great to be back.

35:56.711 --> 35:59.093
The other night before Anna's tragedy,

35:59.118 --> 36:01.285
I really enjoyed getting
to know more of you.

36:01.310 --> 36:03.276
You're all so lovely.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.602
But now I have some hard decisions to make

36:05.627 --> 36:09.067
as to whom I should
get to know even better.

36:12.780 --> 36:14.546
Faith.

36:15.496 --> 36:17.670
Will you continue this journey with me?

36:17.695 --> 36:19.261
Yeah.

36:19.888 --> 36:22.960
Oh, wow. He's really
keeping the Lumberjack.

36:22.985 --> 36:26.020
I guess he wants a buddy.

36:26.747 --> 36:28.197
Oh.

36:29.095 --> 36:30.778
Rose.

36:30.803 --> 36:32.709
Will you continue this journey with me?

36:32.734 --> 36:34.724
Boring.

36:35.188 --> 36:38.444
Ugh. There is only room
for three more, Adam.

36:38.674 --> 36:40.940
The five girls that are not chosen,

36:40.965 --> 36:42.743
the cars will be waiting.

36:46.109 --> 36:47.773
Athena.

36:47.912 --> 36:49.671
Will you continue this journey with me?

36:49.696 --> 36:50.553
Hells yes.

36:50.578 --> 36:52.000
Ooh.

36:52.980 --> 36:55.883
Interesting. Bravo.

36:55.908 --> 36:56.946
Thank you.

36:56.971 --> 36:58.792
Pepper, will you continue
this journey with me?

36:58.817 --> 37:00.269
Yes!

37:00.294 --> 37:02.740
Okay. Good work. Good work.

37:04.160 --> 37:09.096
And I would like to
extend this last invitation

37:09.121 --> 37:13.756
to a very special girl who
truly stole my heart this week.

37:14.124 --> 37:16.437
Anna.

37:20.911 --> 37:23.068
Don't torture me like that again.

37:23.093 --> 37:25.461
I'm really sorry. They made me do it.

37:25.486 --> 37:27.886
Okay.

37:31.399 --> 37:33.357
I'm really glad you're here.

37:33.382 --> 37:35.749
Me too.

37:35.774 --> 37:39.653
Rachel, we need you in
the control room right now.

37:39.677 --> 37:40.688
Hey, Rach.

37:40.713 --> 37:41.774
Hey. Nice work.

37:41.799 --> 37:43.758
- What?
- Um, getting Anna back.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.078
You know, Lizzie's talking to her.

37:45.104 --> 37:46.848
It sounds like this might
actually be really good for her.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.328
Yeah.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.696
Okay. Well, have a good night.

37:50.721 --> 37:52.112
Okay.

37:59.731 --> 38:01.765
Jeremy, um...

38:01.790 --> 38:04.157
What? What's up?

38:04.182 --> 38:06.170
Are you all right?

38:10.812 --> 38:13.479
I'm fine.

38:13.817 --> 38:17.514
I've... I got to go.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.858
I have a lot of black friends.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.225
That's what racists say.

38:24.250 --> 38:28.235
Rock-solid black bitch, Jay.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.190
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

38:30.215 --> 38:32.481
Shia, what do you got?

38:32.625 --> 38:35.026
Meet Pepper.

38:35.193 --> 38:37.907
They're all such sweetie pies.

38:37.932 --> 38:39.979
So fun to have a big group.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.235
It's like Pepper has split
personalities or something.

38:43.260 --> 38:47.266
She shows us a very different
side than she shows Adam.

38:47.291 --> 38:50.344
I want you to cut Rita tonight.

38:50.369 --> 38:53.313
I'll make it worth your while. I promise.

38:53.594 --> 38:57.423
Well, she's, um, definitely weird.

38:57.448 --> 38:58.881
But it could work.

38:58.906 --> 39:03.625
And we can't really keep Athena
around that long, so Pepper.

39:03.651 --> 39:04.344
- Yeah!
- What?

39:04.369 --> 39:05.612
Looks like we have a new villain.

39:05.637 --> 39:06.657
No, no, no, no, no.

39:06.682 --> 39:10.442
Oh, finally. What do you got, Rach?

39:10.467 --> 39:13.985
I heard you were in the edit
bay half the night. Hand it over.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.079
Uh, this is ridiculous. I'm your boss.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.004
What is right behind your back?

39:19.029 --> 39:21.803
Thank you very much. I
will take that from you.

39:21.827 --> 39:25.850
Okay. Here we go, party people.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.077
Everybody get ready.

39:30.532 --> 39:31.898
Let's do this.

39:31.923 --> 39:34.586
Coming up on "Everlasting,"

39:34.612 --> 39:37.681
Adam makes a special connection
with his perfect woman

39:37.705 --> 39:41.196
only to discover she has a dark side.

39:41.454 --> 39:42.820
You bitch.

39:43.228 --> 39:47.230
Get that out of my face.
Just leave me the hell alone.

39:47.255 --> 39:47.993
Ooh.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.360
She had a really sweet moment with Adam

39:50.385 --> 39:51.551
and then ran.

39:51.576 --> 39:53.809
Maybe she has intimacy issues.

39:53.834 --> 39:56.817
Oh, you need? I don't care what you need.

39:56.842 --> 39:58.976
You lied to me about everything.

39:59.001 --> 40:02.193
Who will she attack when her
emotions become dangerous?

40:02.218 --> 40:04.981
You all deserve to burn in hell.

40:05.006 --> 40:07.407
Find out next week on "Everlasting."

40:07.432 --> 40:10.124
What's your problem? It's brilliant.

40:10.149 --> 40:15.803
Take out the death and...
VoilÃ ... psychopath villain.

40:16.438 --> 40:18.012
Sorry.

40:18.037 --> 40:19.772
Here you go.

40:19.797 --> 40:23.932
Don't spend it all on hookers and blow.
