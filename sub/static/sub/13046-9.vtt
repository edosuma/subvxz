01:41.761 --> 01:44.351

01:52.515 --> 01:54.342

01:54.931 --> 01:56.681
_

01:57.421 --> 01:59.833
_

02:06.510 --> 02:09.610
Like the red flu, it arrives silently,

02:09.613 --> 02:12.314
infecting everyone it touches.

02:13.917 --> 02:17.919
The victims have no idea
they've been poisoned.

02:17.921 --> 02:21.056
They hear the news...
The cure has arrived...

02:21.058 --> 02:23.425
So they rush out of hiding,

02:23.427 --> 02:25.961
leaving safe zones and quarantines

02:25.963 --> 02:29.731
for the promise of
protection, of salvation.

02:30.947 --> 02:34.415
They don't know they're already dead.

02:34.417 --> 02:39.287
And the deception at its core
makes it all the more sinister.

02:39.289 --> 02:43.892
Whole nations are at risk
of complete extinction,

02:43.894 --> 02:45.660
and they don't know it.

02:47.764 --> 02:51.599
This is genocide.

02:51.601 --> 02:52.867
Sir, the missile we found

02:52.869 --> 02:54.802
contained enough of the anti-cure

02:54.804 --> 02:57.005
to affect a 20-mile radius or more,

02:57.007 --> 02:58.406
depending on the winds.

02:58.408 --> 03:00.375
Strategically deployed at ports

03:00.377 --> 03:02.143
where the actual cure
would be delivered,

03:02.145 --> 03:04.946
President Peng could kill off
a country the size of Japan

03:04.948 --> 03:06.748
with only six of these weapons.

03:06.750 --> 03:10.084
And how many more of these
missiles are out there, Captain?

03:10.086 --> 03:11.953
It's hard to say, sir.

03:11.955 --> 03:14.255
But we're pretty sure we know
where they're coming from.

03:14.257 --> 03:16.624
And where is that?

03:16.626 --> 03:18.059
Uh, Mr. President,

03:18.061 --> 03:20.295
the intel from the man
whose ship we intercepted

03:20.297 --> 03:21.930
suggests that the missiles
were either picked up

03:21.932 --> 03:24.799
or manufactured from a
small island called Paraiso.

03:24.801 --> 03:26.935
It was an old U.S. Army
forward operating base

03:26.937 --> 03:28.303
from World War II.

03:28.305 --> 03:29.837
Mothballed in the '50s,

03:29.839 --> 03:31.706
it was believed to be
uninhabited until now.

03:31.708 --> 03:34.742
And how certain are you
of this intelligence?

03:34.744 --> 03:36.077
Fairly certain.

03:36.079 --> 03:38.379
Peng is too smart to
do this out in the open.

03:38.381 --> 03:40.882
He'd build and transport
these weapons out of sight

03:40.884 --> 03:42.383
to conceal his involvement.

03:42.385 --> 03:44.252
And what do you need from me?

03:44.254 --> 03:45.820
Sir, Shackleton and Hayward

03:45.822 --> 03:48.823
have been running in circles
since this whole thing began.

03:48.825 --> 03:50.325
I'd like them to join us.

03:50.327 --> 03:51.993
We're gonna need them to take on Peng

03:51.995 --> 03:53.428
and what's left of his navy.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.730
My understanding is
that President Michener

03:55.732 --> 03:58.666
once offered you those ships
and you turned him down,

03:58.668 --> 04:01.603
choosing to run this operation solo.

04:01.605 --> 04:02.904
Yes, sir.

04:02.906 --> 04:05.974
And since then, you've left
a lot of bodies in your wake,

04:05.976 --> 04:08.343
many of them American sailors.

04:08.345 --> 04:11.546
Captain, we don't know each other well,

04:11.548 --> 04:12.847
but you need to know

04:12.849 --> 04:16.584
that if my first act in office
is to declare war on China,

04:16.586 --> 04:18.418
I'd like to base it on something more

04:18.421 --> 04:22.156
than the testimony of
smugglers and pirates.

04:22.158 --> 04:23.791
Of course, sir.

04:23.793 --> 04:25.360
Go to this Paraiso island,

04:25.362 --> 04:28.229
find the source of these
missiles, tie it to Peng,

04:28.231 --> 04:30.164
and I'll do everything in my power

04:30.166 --> 04:31.833
to help you finish him off.

04:31.835 --> 04:35.103
Consider those two
ships under your command.

04:35.105 --> 04:37.105
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

05:07.504 --> 05:10.471
Dennis, POTUS wants the
proof-of-life videos ASAP.

05:10.473 --> 05:11.739
Please tell me you figured out

05:11.741 --> 05:13.474
what's wrong with our video signal.

05:13.476 --> 05:16.377
That distortion... the warble
on incoming communications...

05:16.379 --> 05:19.213
Look.

05:19.215 --> 05:20.882
It looks like noise, but it's not.

05:20.884 --> 05:22.917
It's a signal meant to
block a part of the channel,

05:22.919 --> 05:24.318
like a reserved carpool lane.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.553
Where's it coming from?

05:25.555 --> 05:27.655
I don't know, but
with this lane blocked,

05:27.657 --> 05:30.258
it's taking up extra bandwidth
and we can't get a video signal.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.859
Can you fix it?

05:31.861 --> 05:34.195
Not unless I can figure out how
it got there in the first place.

05:34.197 --> 05:36.330
I clipped off a few
chunks of data to analyze.

05:36.332 --> 05:38.099
Each is a small burst of information,

05:38.101 --> 05:40.435
but it's encrypted.

05:40.437 --> 05:43.371
Been a while since ASW school,

05:43.373 --> 05:46.307
but I know how to read a signal...

05:49.245 --> 05:52.380
... and I know that pattern.

05:52.382 --> 05:54.082
It's a human voice.

05:54.084 --> 05:56.250
Wait, a voice? Are you sure?

05:56.252 --> 05:58.586
Where's the president?

05:59.322 --> 06:01.055
In the Oval Office, sir.

06:01.057 --> 06:03.157
Those the troop-readiness reports?

06:03.159 --> 06:04.759
All available military assets

06:04.761 --> 06:08.029
- and what's left of our leadership on the...
- Save it.

06:08.031 --> 06:09.630
I got it.

06:12.602 --> 06:14.435
- I'm sorry, Kara.
- It's fine.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.671
I know you're feeling a little
bit boxed out these days,

06:16.673 --> 06:18.172
and I have not done
enough to bring you in,

06:18.174 --> 06:20.174
but believe me, I'm working on it.

06:22.312 --> 06:23.544
Things are changing around here,

06:23.546 --> 06:25.813
but we all still want the same thing.

06:25.815 --> 06:27.815
And Secretary Rivera?

06:30.253 --> 06:32.320
Well, I'm gonna have to
operate under the assumption

06:32.322 --> 06:35.590
that he's as much of a
patriot as the rest of us.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.043
Hey, Doc, give me the room.

06:56.045 --> 06:57.612
I'll check on your wife and son.

06:57.614 --> 06:59.247
Thank you.

07:02.752 --> 07:04.218
How they doing?

07:04.220 --> 07:07.188
My son is strong.

07:07.190 --> 07:10.658
My wife and I...

07:10.660 --> 07:15.296
The transfusions are
becoming less effective.

07:15.298 --> 07:17.265
Heard you were looking for me.

07:18.401 --> 07:21.169
What Peng did to Japan,

07:21.171 --> 07:24.705
we cannot allow that to happen again...

07:24.707 --> 07:26.407
Anywhere.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.875
On that, we agree.

07:27.877 --> 07:29.443
Let me help you.

07:29.445 --> 07:34.182
I have men. I have ships.
I know these waters.

07:35.185 --> 07:38.386
We can fight him together.

07:38.388 --> 07:41.455
I owe you that much.

07:42.759 --> 07:44.559
Captain.

07:44.561 --> 07:47.395
Get some rest, Captain.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.167
Nathan James, this is Nomad.

07:53.169 --> 07:55.770
Vulture team is on Paraiso
Island, heading out.

07:55.772 --> 07:58.339
Roger that, Nomad.

08:01.778 --> 08:04.278
Nathan James, Vulture team on deck.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.379
All conditions normal.

08:05.381 --> 08:07.348
On the move.

08:07.350 --> 08:09.517
Roger, Vulture team. Good luck.

08:09.819 --> 08:12.486
Wolf, Burk, sitrep?

08:12.488 --> 08:13.721
The port is empty, sir.

08:13.723 --> 08:15.723
No ships, no cargo, no people.

08:15.725 --> 08:17.892
That boat came to this
island for something,

08:17.894 --> 08:20.962
so unless this is a hot
spot for drugs and champagne,

08:20.964 --> 08:22.396
the missiles are here.

08:22.398 --> 08:25.700
"Paradise"... That's
what "paraiso" means.

08:25.702 --> 08:27.501
That's either Peng's
idea of a joke, or...

08:27.503 --> 08:29.737
I met the man. He's not that funny.

08:29.739 --> 08:33.039
Raining poison green
death on his neighbors...

08:33.042 --> 08:37.211
That's Peng's idea of a joke.

08:39.849 --> 08:43.951
Used to be a 16-inch gun
there, size of a building.

08:43.953 --> 08:46.287
They took defending the
island pretty seriously.

08:46.289 --> 08:49.290
16 could hit anything on the horizon.

08:49.292 --> 08:52.326
Thank God it's not there anymore.

09:18.021 --> 09:20.621
A little help?

09:36.522 --> 09:38.522
We heard rumors about
a safe place to live,

09:38.524 --> 09:40.190
far from the red death.

09:40.192 --> 09:41.559
And people from all over...

09:41.561 --> 09:44.795
Laos, Vietnam, China, the Philippines...

09:44.797 --> 09:46.864
Came here to be safe.

09:46.866 --> 09:50.334
So we started schools,
farms... Everything.

09:50.336 --> 09:52.570
Everything is perfect here.

09:52.572 --> 09:53.737
Paradise.

09:53.739 --> 09:57.608
Yes, exactly. Paraiso.

10:09.255 --> 10:11.822
We walk from here.

10:23.803 --> 10:26.770
When was the last time
this base was operational?

10:26.772 --> 10:28.472
X.O. said early '50s.

10:28.474 --> 10:29.773
No, it must've been later.

10:29.775 --> 10:32.076
"Rebel Without a
Cause" came out in 1955.

10:32.078 --> 10:34.912
I went through a James
Dean phase in high school.

10:34.914 --> 10:36.146
It's okay.

10:36.148 --> 10:37.615
It's okay. It's okay.

10:37.617 --> 10:39.984
These are friends...

10:39.986 --> 10:42.186
American friends.

10:55.768 --> 10:57.735
Why are you here in Paraiso?

10:57.737 --> 10:59.570
How did you hear of us?

10:59.572 --> 11:03.440
We were sent to the base to
check on old weapons ordnance.

11:03.442 --> 11:05.009
Know of any?

11:05.011 --> 11:07.978
No. No, my friend. No weapons here.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.615
China has claimed most of
the islands in this chain.

11:11.617 --> 11:13.083
President Peng know you're here?

11:13.085 --> 11:14.518
Yes, oh, yes.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.186
Peng knows.

11:16.188 --> 11:17.788
He leaves us alone to live in peace.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.623
How do you live? What goes on here?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.058
We work.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.426
We have a factory.

11:22.428 --> 11:23.894
Everyone buys from us.

11:23.896 --> 11:26.296
We'd like to see this factory.

11:26.298 --> 11:27.865
Of course.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.967
Of course. I will show you.

12:17.349 --> 12:18.716
See?

12:18.718 --> 12:20.417
Very productive.

12:20.419 --> 12:23.220
And...

12:23.222 --> 12:25.022
the best quality.

12:25.024 --> 12:29.026
Single stitch, overlock stitch.

12:53.285 --> 12:58.355
They go all over...
Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia.

13:01.393 --> 13:02.626
Please.

13:02.628 --> 13:04.328
My apologies.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.630
They get paid for how
many items they make.

13:06.632 --> 13:08.565
We should not interrupt.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.634
I can answer your questions.

13:28.821 --> 13:30.821
What, are we storming a Hanes factory?

13:30.823 --> 13:32.289
I can show you the school now.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.892
We have many children, thanks to God.

13:34.894 --> 13:37.995
You know, this isn't the
factory I wanted to see.

13:37.997 --> 13:40.164
I don't understand, Captain.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.965
This is the only factory on the island.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.400
I swear to my God.

13:46.238 --> 13:48.906
Malaya! It's just a dog!

13:52.144 --> 13:52.943
Who is she?

13:52.945 --> 13:54.711
Don't worry about her.

13:54.713 --> 13:55.913
Silly girl.

13:55.915 --> 13:57.614
She's been giving us trouble lately.

13:57.616 --> 13:58.816
Maybe it's her age.

13:58.818 --> 14:00.684
Captain?

14:00.686 --> 14:02.019
No.

14:02.021 --> 14:04.121
This is not necessary. What is he doing?

14:14.333 --> 14:16.366
Help us. Please.

14:16.368 --> 14:17.968
I-I am scared.

14:17.970 --> 14:20.070
My parents are dead. I live here alone.

14:20.072 --> 14:21.271
- I am scared every day.
- It's okay.

14:21.273 --> 14:22.606
Hey, calm down. It's all right.

14:22.608 --> 14:23.907
Y-you're safe.

14:23.909 --> 14:25.843
Tell me, what's going on?

14:25.845 --> 14:27.277
You're Americans?

14:27.279 --> 14:28.278
Yes.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.948
I'm Danny. Tell me your name.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.482
I-I am Malaya.

14:32.484 --> 14:33.951
I-I am a slave here.

14:33.953 --> 14:36.787
You're a slave in... in that factory?

14:36.789 --> 14:38.021
Making clothes?

14:38.023 --> 14:38.956
No.

14:38.958 --> 14:41.058
There is a-another factory,

14:41.060 --> 14:44.795
a-a real factory near
the big, old guns.

14:44.797 --> 14:45.963
What do you make at that factory?

14:45.965 --> 14:48.198
Malaya, Malaya. Please, no.

14:49.368 --> 14:51.602
Just go. Just go now.

14:52.771 --> 14:54.504
Shut her mouth about what?

14:54.506 --> 14:55.772
Nothing.

14:55.774 --> 14:58.275
Tell them about the
ship that came yesterday.

14:58.277 --> 14:59.743
What kind of ship?

14:59.745 --> 15:02.346
Malaya.

15:02.348 --> 15:04.214
A... a Chinese warship.

15:04.216 --> 15:07.184
Captain, she says there's
another factory on the island.

15:10.723 --> 15:13.223
It's match point.

15:13.225 --> 15:15.092
You decide how you want to play it.

15:15.094 --> 15:17.728
Either way, you're taking
us where we want to go.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.804
Kara, glad I caught you.

15:36.806 --> 15:38.772
Secretary Rivera.

15:38.774 --> 15:41.208
What brings you to my office?

15:44.347 --> 15:46.180
I'm worried, Kara.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.349
About what, sir?

15:48.351 --> 15:50.017
About you,

15:50.019 --> 15:52.720
about whose team you're on.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.455
Sir, I am just as
committed to the recovery

15:54.457 --> 15:56.891
of the United States as
I was when I first landed

15:56.893 --> 15:58.159
in St. Louis with Captain Chandler.

15:58.161 --> 16:00.895
Ah, yes. The great Captain Chandler.

16:00.897 --> 16:03.631
The legend, the man that we devoted

16:03.633 --> 16:07.868
enormous amounts of time and
resources to get out of trouble.

16:07.870 --> 16:10.638
I understand your concern, sir,

16:10.640 --> 16:11.872
but now that Captain Chandler

16:11.874 --> 16:13.641
has uncovered a genocide in Asia...

16:13.643 --> 16:15.876
A... alleged genocide.

16:15.878 --> 16:18.312
Kara, you have to remember,

16:18.314 --> 16:21.482
we're living in a post-apocalypse.

16:21.484 --> 16:26.353
Facts and truths are just as
much the victim of this plague

16:26.355 --> 16:27.888
as everything else.

16:27.890 --> 16:29.757
Right now, the best thing we can do

16:29.759 --> 16:32.693
is focus on the American people.

16:32.695 --> 16:36.063
I'm not sure exactly
what you're suggesting.

16:36.065 --> 16:37.765
Can you be more specific?

16:37.767 --> 16:39.066
What I'm suggesting, Kara,

16:39.068 --> 16:42.303
is that while everyone
is looking eastward,

16:42.305 --> 16:48.008
our country is collapsing
beneath our feet.

16:48.010 --> 16:50.044
And when the chips fall,

16:50.046 --> 16:53.714
it's important you know
who your friends are.

16:55.384 --> 16:56.817
Is that clear enough?

16:56.819 --> 16:59.653
Yes, sir.

16:59.655 --> 17:01.922
I'm glad.

17:16.372 --> 17:17.871
Stop the cart.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.710
What's down there?

17:22.712 --> 17:25.546
Uh... just an old bunker...

17:25.548 --> 17:26.680
I want to see it.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.382
I don't have any keys.

17:28.384 --> 17:29.483
We do.

17:29.485 --> 17:30.952
Burk.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.933
Access granted.

17:43.334 --> 17:45.350
Please, there's no one down here.

17:45.534 --> 17:46.533
This is Vulture team.

17:46.535 --> 17:49.003
We may have found the entrance
to the munitions factory.

17:49.005 --> 17:50.070
Stand by for coordinates.

17:50.072 --> 17:51.238
Roger that, Vulture team.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.173
T.A.O., spin up two TLAMs.

17:53.175 --> 17:55.109
I want enough to burn up
everything in that factory.

17:55.111 --> 17:58.679
Aye, sir. MSS, T.A.O.,
spin up two TLAMs.

18:10.559 --> 18:12.092
See?

18:12.094 --> 18:13.927
Nothin...

18:15.498 --> 18:17.431
Take cover!

18:21.203 --> 18:22.403
Nathan James, Nathan James,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.004
Vulture team is engaging the enemy.

18:24.006 --> 18:26.173
- Taking heavy fire.
- Vulture team, fall back.

18:26.175 --> 18:27.741
We'll provide fire
support with the five-inch.

18:27.743 --> 18:31.345
Negative. I need to see
what's inside that facility.

18:40.556 --> 18:42.356
Paradise, my ass.

19:31.841 --> 19:35.709
Nathan James, Vulture team
advancing on munitions site.

19:35.711 --> 19:37.211
Combatants neutralized.

19:37.213 --> 19:38.946
All right, Vulture team.

19:43.119 --> 19:44.485
This is the place, all right.

19:44.487 --> 19:47.020
Looks like Peng had them
clear everything out.

19:47.022 --> 19:48.622
Like he knew we were coming.

19:48.624 --> 19:51.558
And here's one of their
missiles... or part of one.

19:53.396 --> 19:55.696
Okay.

19:55.698 --> 19:57.631
But where'd they go?

20:11.747 --> 20:12.980
What's it say?

20:12.982 --> 20:14.915
Inchon.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.550
The missiles are headed to Korea.

20:16.552 --> 20:18.452
Malaya was right. He's
not shipping his missiles

20:18.454 --> 20:20.320
on a small pleasure boat anymore.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.855
No.

20:21.857 --> 20:23.490
He took a warship.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.896
Sneaker. Tropics. Flaming.

20:32.898 --> 20:37.133
Sneaker. Tropics. Flaming.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.268
What the hell is that?

20:38.270 --> 20:39.769
Here's the second batch.

20:40.806 --> 20:45.275
Unswept. Operations. Curdling.

20:45.277 --> 20:49.212
Unswept. Operations. Curdling.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.348
This is what's been
blocking our video signal.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.116
And we don't know what it means.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.884
This code... It's either super simple

20:54.886 --> 20:57.087
or enigma-level complicated.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.456
But, Kara, based on this data,

20:59.458 --> 21:00.991
it looks like the signal is coming from

21:00.993 --> 21:02.959
inside this building.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.929
There are several
different shipping lanes

21:05.931 --> 21:07.831
with varying currents
that the Chinese destroyer

21:07.833 --> 21:09.366
could've chosen.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.234
This here... This is used for

21:11.236 --> 21:13.436
oil tankers and commercial ships.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.606
It runs north from here to
the leeward side of Taiwan

21:16.608 --> 21:18.808
then splits off after Yonaguni Island.

21:18.810 --> 21:22.445
The eastern route goes
to Vladivostok and Japan.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.615
The western route... that
runs straight north to Korea.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.884
And you recommend
that as our new course?

21:27.886 --> 21:32.455
Well, given the limited
information we have, sir, yes.

21:34.826 --> 21:38.128
Captain, do you concur?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.530
Peng knows you are looking for him.

21:40.532 --> 21:45.669
He will use the Formosa Strait
between Taiwan and the mainland.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.870
It is more narrow,

21:46.872 --> 21:51.041
with more obstacles
to hide from the radar.

21:51.842 --> 21:54.360
That's where we'll find the
ship carrying the poison.

21:55.513 --> 21:58.148
Then that's our new course.

22:01.853 --> 22:05.388
Captain's on the bridge.
Sir, you have Nathan James.

22:09.564 --> 22:11.364
This is Hayward Actual, over.

22:11.366 --> 22:13.767
Captain Meylan, how are things?

22:13.769 --> 22:15.735
Sir, the Hayward is
at her fighting weight

22:15.737 --> 22:18.171
and happy to be of service
to you and the Nathan James.

22:18.173 --> 22:19.906
Couldn't ask for a better wingman.

22:19.908 --> 22:21.841
I read your service
record since Annapolis

22:21.843 --> 22:24.210
and I know how admirably
you distinguished yourself

22:24.212 --> 22:25.278
during the plague.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.846
I'm not in your league, sir,

22:26.848 --> 22:29.015
but I certainly
appreciate the sentiment.

22:29.017 --> 22:31.084
I've spoken with Commander
Hicks on the Shackleton.

22:31.086 --> 22:33.486
From his position, he can
run point into the Strait.

22:33.488 --> 22:35.555
- We'll be right behind.
- Outstanding.

22:35.557 --> 22:37.524
Intel suggests the
intercept point will be

22:37.526 --> 22:41.795
23.41 North by 118.83 East.

22:41.797 --> 22:43.062
You'll beat us there,

22:43.064 --> 22:45.799
but we'll intercept the
Chinese destroyer in two hours.

22:45.801 --> 22:48.101
We have designated that
destroyer with the code name

22:48.103 --> 22:50.036
- Sea Dragon.
- Sounds about right.

22:50.038 --> 22:54.641
C.N.O., is this a stop,
board, and seize operation?

22:54.643 --> 22:55.909
No, Captain.

22:55.911 --> 22:58.711
It's a cut the head off
the dragon operation.

22:58.713 --> 22:59.813
Understood.

22:59.815 --> 23:00.947
You're not alone.

23:00.949 --> 23:02.916
DESRON is ready for tasking, sir.

23:04.853 --> 23:06.219
That was Tom Chandler?

23:06.221 --> 23:07.720
Damn right it was.

23:13.862 --> 23:16.463
So, this is where Chandler's
gonna meet our other ships.

23:16.465 --> 23:18.731
Yes, sir. In the Formosa Strait.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.500
Captain Chandler just radioed in.

23:20.502 --> 23:25.972
He's at 23.41 North by 118.83 East.

23:25.974 --> 23:28.308
Shackleton's approaching from the north,

23:28.310 --> 23:30.577
Hayward from the south-southeast.

23:30.579 --> 23:31.778
That's how they'll triangulate

23:31.780 --> 23:34.047
and attack the Chinese destroyer.

23:34.049 --> 23:37.450
Anyway, I hope this puts
an end to this chapter.

23:42.251 --> 23:43.851
C.N.O. on the bridge.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.160
Hayward's hull-down on the horizon.

23:47.162 --> 23:48.628
Let's close the distance.

23:48.630 --> 23:50.396
Sea Dragon's out there.

23:50.398 --> 23:52.131
We'll have surprise, but not for long.

23:52.133 --> 23:54.867
- O.O.D., all ahead full.
- Aye, all ahead full.

23:55.670 --> 23:58.104
Nathan James, this is Shackleton.

23:58.106 --> 24:01.975
We have a SKUNK 14 miles out,
heading north at 32 knots.

24:01.977 --> 24:03.510
Roger, Shackleton.

24:04.379 --> 24:06.312
Sea Dragon's hauling ass.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.715
Hayward, this is Nathan
James. Do you have SKUNK?

24:08.717 --> 24:10.850
Nathan James, I'm looking
at the same picture you are.

24:10.852 --> 24:13.419
We have the target.
Designate ship as hostile.

24:13.421 --> 24:14.420
Aye, sir.

24:14.422 --> 24:15.655
Set General Quarters.

24:16.525 --> 24:17.724
General Quarters, General Quarters.

24:17.726 --> 24:19.259
All hands, man your battle stations.

24:19.261 --> 24:21.261
You know what this means...
Sinking that destroyer.

24:21.263 --> 24:23.563
- War.
- Declared by us.

24:23.565 --> 24:25.632
If it comes down to
it, I'll take the heat.

24:25.634 --> 24:28.234
No, sir. We'll take it together.

24:28.236 --> 24:32.105
Shackleton, this is
Hayward. We hold ES...

24:32.107 --> 24:33.606
I cracked it.

24:33.608 --> 24:35.708
The three words...
They're map coordinates.

24:35.710 --> 24:36.543
GPS?

24:36.545 --> 24:38.845
Simpler, sort of. Th...

24:39.447 --> 24:41.915
They're closing in on
the Chinese destroyer.

24:42.016 --> 24:44.560
All units in Zulu, this is Zulu Actual.

24:44.652 --> 24:46.419
Continue to track by***

24:46.421 --> 24:47.754
I did some research.

24:47.756 --> 24:49.956
The three words, it's a system that maps

24:49.958 --> 24:52.592
every nine-square meter spot on Earth.

24:52.594 --> 24:55.595
Look. This message just
came in across the line.

24:55.597 --> 24:59.732
Another three words...
Barn, table, yard...

24:59.734 --> 25:02.936
- And here's the GPS coordinates it lines up with.
- Dennis?

25:03.638 --> 25:05.038
Give me everything.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.973
Here it is, in order.

25:08.476 --> 25:10.777
How far away is the Chinese destroyer?

25:10.779 --> 25:12.378
Um, sir, last time we heard,

25:12.380 --> 25:14.514
it was 15 kilometers from the James,

25:14.516 --> 25:17.784
closer to the other ships.

25:17.786 --> 25:19.285
This is Hayward.

25:19.287 --> 25:22.322
Contact has slight left
bearing drift... over.

25:22.324 --> 25:23.756
This is Shackleton.

25:23.758 --> 25:27.393
Hold ES for Sea Dragon, bearing 2-4-5.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.863
Recommend Hayward close
Sea Dragon. Remain at EMCON.

25:34.169 --> 25:35.735
Aah!

25:53.755 --> 25:56.723
We have relative
bearing 3-0-5 degrees.

25:56.725 --> 25:59.025
SKUNK Alpha, present
target position 1-8-0...

25:59.027 --> 26:01.094
Got a solid spot track on the target.

26:03.598 --> 26:05.765
CIC, coordinate fire control solutions

26:05.767 --> 26:07.266
with Shackleton and Hayward.

26:07.268 --> 26:09.302
This is Shackleton. Roger, break.

26:09.304 --> 26:10.870
- Bird's affirm.
- CIC, bridge.

26:10.872 --> 26:12.605
We are five minutes from
the rendezvous point.

26:12.607 --> 26:13.973
I see Hayward.

26:17.012 --> 26:18.511
Who are these guys?!

26:18.513 --> 26:20.413
Chinese Secret Service!

26:23.885 --> 26:27.186
The Formosa Strait between
Taiwan and the mainland.

26:27.188 --> 26:29.789
Sonar range from slant
range and target depth.

26:29.791 --> 26:31.691
Ready to fire on any surface contact.

26:31.693 --> 26:33.259
All ships, stop! Stop! Stop!

26:33.261 --> 26:36.162
Vampire! Vampire! Vampire! Fox
three inbound bearing 2-5-6!

26:36.164 --> 26:37.530
Launch chaff!

26:38.900 --> 26:41.100
All personnel, brace for impact!

26:48.076 --> 26:50.576
This is the Shackleton.
We have incoming.

26:50.578 --> 26:53.012
Brace for impact! Brace for impact!

26:54.549 --> 26:57.417
Shackleton hit. Repeat, we've been hit.

26:57.419 --> 26:59.786
Report damages to CCS.

27:13.871 --> 27:16.272
Incoming. Destroy.

27:21.679 --> 27:24.213
Corpsman! We need a
corpsman on the bridge!

27:26.317 --> 27:28.918
Sound and Security... report
damage and flooding status.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.787
Sound and Security. We
have water integrity.

27:31.789 --> 27:33.789
CIC, bridge.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.125
Did those missiles come
from the Chinese ship?

27:36.127 --> 27:38.360
Negative. They launched from mainland.

27:38.362 --> 27:41.230
- They knew we were coming.
- How the hell?

27:41.232 --> 27:42.932
Nathan James, this is Hayward Actual.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.934
We have incoming. Request air cover.

27:44.936 --> 27:46.669
Brace for impact!

27:53.644 --> 27:55.644
There are more vampires.

27:55.646 --> 27:58.614
- Air, kill track 4-8-7-2-6 with birds.
- Air, aye.

27:58.616 --> 28:01.750
Killing track 4-8-7-2-6 with birds.

28:02.987 --> 28:04.720
Attention Shackleton, all hands!

28:04.722 --> 28:05.955
Prepare to abandon ship!

28:05.957 --> 28:08.157
All hands, prepare to aban...

28:11.762 --> 28:13.262
Vampire! Vampire! Vampire!

28:13.264 --> 28:14.663
Second fox 3 inbound.

28:14.665 --> 28:16.131
Third fox 3 inbound.

28:16.133 --> 28:18.367
Birds away, track 4-8-7-2-6.

28:18.369 --> 28:20.102
Air, kill vampires 2 and 3 with birds.

28:20.104 --> 28:22.171
T.A.O., RSC. Vampire 1 trashed.

28:22.173 --> 28:24.340
- Multiples still inbound.
- Birds away.

28:24.342 --> 28:26.075
Vampires 4 and 5.

28:29.747 --> 28:32.147
Incoming destroyed. Fire in...

28:33.084 --> 28:36.051
We've lost incoming signals
from all three ships.

28:36.053 --> 28:38.620
CIC, trace incoming missiles.
Target land batteries.

28:38.622 --> 28:40.289
Solving, sir.

28:41.993 --> 28:44.193
Tom, we can't let that
Chinese ship get away.

28:44.195 --> 28:47.496
T.A.O., you got target
coordinates on that SKUNK?

28:47.498 --> 28:49.398
Solving now, sir. Stand by.

28:55.306 --> 28:58.507
T.A.O., track 3-5-8-2-9
designated hostile,

28:58.509 --> 29:01.076
- standing by to kill with birds.
- Captain, T.A.O.

29:01.078 --> 29:04.213
Standing by for fire orders
on SKUNK and land battery.

29:04.215 --> 29:06.415
- Fire! Fire!
- Missiles away.

29:08.619 --> 29:10.352
Vampire 5 is going supersonic.

29:10.354 --> 29:12.855
Bridge, brace for impact! Port side!

29:12.857 --> 29:15.290
T.A.O., CIWS engaged.

29:25.002 --> 29:28.237
Confirm, SKUNK is trashed.
Sea Dragon is sunk.

29:28.239 --> 29:30.339
Confirm, land battery trashed.

29:31.776 --> 29:35.544
Captain, C.N.O., Shackleton is gone.

29:35.546 --> 29:37.413
No longer responding to hails.

29:37.415 --> 29:38.914
Not visible on radar.

29:38.916 --> 29:41.383
Get Nomad in the air.

29:41.385 --> 29:42.751
Search for survivors.

29:42.753 --> 29:45.788
Put rescue and VBSS teams in the water.

29:45.790 --> 29:47.890
Save what's left of Hayward.

30:58.162 --> 31:00.829
Up.

31:10.107 --> 31:12.941
Here we go, buddy. On two.

31:12.943 --> 31:16.044
One, two, three, four.

31:22.745 --> 31:24.035
You're gonna be all right.

31:30.327 --> 31:31.994
O'Connor?

31:31.996 --> 31:34.596
Miller.

31:34.598 --> 31:36.231
You son of a bitch.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.933
I heard you were on Shackleton.
I thought you were dead.

31:37.935 --> 31:39.868
I got transferred to Hayward a week ago.

31:39.870 --> 31:41.737
I thought you were dead.

31:41.739 --> 31:43.705
Master Chief.

31:43.707 --> 31:45.941
Master Chief. Never
thought I was gonna see you.

31:45.943 --> 31:47.843
Later. Let's help the wounded.

31:47.845 --> 31:49.344
Aye, aye.

32:05.963 --> 32:08.230
Nathan James, Nomad.

32:08.232 --> 32:12.034
Captain, I see an oil
slick about a mile long.

32:12.036 --> 32:14.679
Heavy debris field,
no bodies in the water.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.673
No signs of life. No
apparent survivors, sir.

32:17.675 --> 32:19.541
Sorry, Captain.

32:30.154 --> 32:32.487
Roger, Nomad. Return to ship.

32:54.312 --> 32:58.381
85 confirmed dead,
another 23 missing. My God.

32:58.383 --> 33:01.217
Search and rescue will continue
as long as they have to.

33:03.588 --> 33:05.054
Whoever did this,

33:05.056 --> 33:07.023
if they know we're still
afloat, they will be back.

33:07.025 --> 33:09.459
We'll leave no one behind,
Captain. You have my word.

33:09.461 --> 33:11.361
What the hell happened?

33:11.363 --> 33:12.629
We were set up.

33:12.631 --> 33:14.697
We don't know how or by whom,

33:14.699 --> 33:17.534
but Peng knew exactly where
we'd be and when we'd be there.

33:17.536 --> 33:21.304
Sir, may I ask, how did we
end up at these coordinates?

33:21.306 --> 33:22.472
Who sent us here?

33:22.474 --> 33:24.274
Takehaya.

33:24.276 --> 33:26.376
The Japanese pirate?

33:26.378 --> 33:29.212
The same man who kidnapped
and tortured your crew?

33:29.214 --> 33:32.148
He's not responsible for this.
He's with us now, against Peng.

33:32.150 --> 33:33.483
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

33:33.485 --> 33:35.685
Captain Slattery will
show you to your quarters,

33:35.687 --> 33:38.121
brief you on the particulars.

33:40.492 --> 33:41.791
I know we lost a lot today,

33:41.793 --> 33:43.893
but we prevented a genocide in Korea.

33:43.895 --> 33:46.062
We'll take care of our wounded,

33:46.064 --> 33:48.798
then we'll finish Peng off for good.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.867
Yes, sir.

34:35.647 --> 34:37.547
Kara.

34:37.549 --> 34:40.583
I want to know why you
tried to stop our ships.

34:40.585 --> 34:41.985
Sir?

34:41.987 --> 34:44.853
You knew they were gonna be attacked.

34:44.856 --> 34:46.922
I want to know how.

34:46.925 --> 34:49.492
It was just an instinct, sir...

34:49.494 --> 34:52.495
The way they were being
drawn into that pass.

34:52.496 --> 34:54.197
An instinct.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.532
They've been ambushed before, sir.

34:56.534 --> 34:58.501
I have the Nathan James.

35:01.573 --> 35:03.473
This is Secretary Rivera.

35:03.475 --> 35:06.976
This is C.N.O. Listen up,
'cause I don't have much time.

35:06.978 --> 35:09.646
We were taken by
surprise... All three ships.

35:09.648 --> 35:13.080
James is seaworthy, Shackleton
was sunk, Hayward damaged,

35:13.085 --> 35:14.250
and survivors, including Captain Meylan,

35:14.252 --> 35:16.486
- are now aboard the James.
- How did this happen?!

35:16.488 --> 35:18.588
It is my belief that our
lines of communication

35:18.590 --> 35:20.990
have been compromised by the enemy.

35:20.992 --> 35:23.293
Until further notice,
we will be at EMCON.

35:24.129 --> 35:26.062
- X.O., set EMCON Alpha.
- Aye, sir.

35:26.064 --> 35:27.730
Is that Captain Chandler?

35:27.732 --> 35:29.565
He just hung up.

35:29.567 --> 35:31.200
Well?

35:31.202 --> 35:34.470
The James survived the attack,
but we lost the Shackleton,

35:34.472 --> 35:36.506
and the Hayward is seriously damaged.

35:36.508 --> 35:38.808
Captain Meylan is with the C.N.O.

35:38.810 --> 35:40.576
- I want to talk to them.
- I'm sorry, sir.

35:40.578 --> 35:42.111
But they went radio silent.

35:42.113 --> 35:43.913
Damn it, why? What happened?

35:43.915 --> 35:45.481
Sir, we were ambushed.

35:45.483 --> 35:46.933
Somehow, the Chinese knew where

35:46.935 --> 35:48.284
all of our ships would rendezvous.

35:48.286 --> 35:51.421
This is a Goddamn disaster.

35:54.575 --> 35:56.175
- Mr. President...
- Give me a minute.

36:11.526 --> 36:14.660
We have a Marine Recon
Division. They're scattered,

36:14.662 --> 36:17.230
but they could be organized
and deployed to Asia.

36:17.232 --> 36:18.564
If they flew to Pearl,

36:18.566 --> 36:20.166
they could then sail from there

36:20.168 --> 36:22.769
to effect a search and
rescue of our ships.

36:22.771 --> 36:24.804
That's not gonna happen.

36:24.806 --> 36:26.139
What the hell does that mean?

36:26.141 --> 36:27.407
Just what I said.

36:27.409 --> 36:29.475
Chandler's China adventure ends now.

36:31.112 --> 36:32.545
Sit down, Howard. We need to talk.

36:32.547 --> 36:34.113
Don't tell me to sit down, Allison.

36:34.115 --> 36:35.615
Do you know who the
hell you're talking to?

36:35.617 --> 36:36.783
I do.

36:36.785 --> 36:39.185
You were the mayor here.
You ran a great city.

36:39.187 --> 36:40.486
This was your town.

36:40.488 --> 36:42.555
Damn right. And now I'm the president.

36:42.557 --> 36:45.491
I'm gonna ask you one more
time, Howard. Sit down.

36:47.729 --> 36:49.896
Sit down, my ass.

36:49.898 --> 36:51.097
What are you doing?

36:51.099 --> 36:52.865
I'm tossing you the hell out.

36:52.867 --> 36:55.768
- You're fired, Allison.
- There's nobody to call, Howard.

36:55.770 --> 36:57.670
The lines have been cut.

36:57.672 --> 36:59.038
Since the disaster at sea,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.840
the White House has
been put on lock-down

37:00.842 --> 37:02.041
on your orders.

37:02.043 --> 37:03.776
On my orders?

37:46.054 --> 37:47.453
Are you joking?

37:47.455 --> 37:49.021
Not at all.

37:49.023 --> 37:51.424
Oh, we'll see about that.

37:56.297 --> 37:57.697
Who the hell are you?

37:57.699 --> 38:00.333
Your security detail has
been repurposed, Howard.

38:00.335 --> 38:03.002
From now on, my men,
Agents Murphy and Costas,

38:03.004 --> 38:04.303
will protect you.

38:04.305 --> 38:07.440
My God, Allison. What have you done?

38:18.353 --> 38:20.453
Mr. President, through
no fault of your own,

38:20.455 --> 38:21.654
you've stepped through the looking glass

38:21.656 --> 38:23.723
into the birth of a new America.

38:23.725 --> 38:25.658
The pandemic, the millions of deaths,

38:25.660 --> 38:27.460
the complete collapse of law and order

38:27.462 --> 38:30.163
demands a revolution of governance.

38:30.165 --> 38:32.698
Revolution? You mean coup d'état.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.367
Who are you working with? Castillo?

38:34.369 --> 38:38.204
Castillo, Price, Wilson, Croft.

38:38.206 --> 38:41.774
America can no longer be
governed by a central power,

38:41.776 --> 38:43.643
not now.

38:43.645 --> 38:46.445
Each region must look after itself.

38:46.447 --> 38:49.582
Sons of bitches. I knew it.

38:49.584 --> 38:51.584
Relax, Howard. This is a good thing.

38:51.586 --> 38:53.686
You knew that Michener
was moving too fast,

38:53.688 --> 38:55.221
that America wasn't healthy enough

38:55.223 --> 38:57.256
to go back to the way things were.

38:57.258 --> 38:59.458
There are no states.
There are no cities.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.561
There are only tribes
scrambling out of the mud

39:01.563 --> 39:04.797
over the bodies of 300
million dead Americans.

39:04.799 --> 39:07.266
Face it, Howard... Democracy is a luxury

39:07.268 --> 39:09.635
that we can no longer afford.

39:10.972 --> 39:12.515
Be patient, Alex.

39:12.533 --> 39:15.007
This is crazy. I mean, what
the hell are you talking about?

39:15.009 --> 39:16.709
What are we supposed to do...

39:35.597 --> 39:36.963
Oh, my God.

39:38.166 --> 39:39.865
Who is this?

39:39.867 --> 39:41.601
Senator Beatty.

39:41.603 --> 39:44.237
Oh, my God. I'm gonna get you help.

39:44.239 --> 39:47.273
No, no, no, no, no. Kara, Kara!

39:47.275 --> 39:51.077
T-T-They're
all in on it.

39:51.079 --> 39:52.912
Who? What... What do you mean?

39:52.914 --> 39:56.082
You're not safe.

40:08.896 --> 40:11.998
By now, Senator Beatty and
Secretary Rivera are dead.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.735
If you try to contact any
of your allies in the city,

40:15.737 --> 40:17.937
the consequences will be swift...

40:17.939 --> 40:20.406
As swift as they were
for Jeffrey Michener.

40:21.075 --> 40:22.808
You're insane.

40:22.810 --> 40:24.677
That's it.

40:24.679 --> 40:26.746
Y-You've gone completely insane.

40:26.748 --> 40:29.382
Do you understand me, Howard?

40:29.384 --> 40:31.717
Your family, your friends...

40:31.719 --> 40:35.554
None of them will be safe
if you do not play ball.

40:35.556 --> 40:36.989
Take a minute and think about it

40:36.991 --> 40:40.359
before you make any
decisions you'll later regret.

40:43.531 --> 40:45.131
Everybody likes you, Howard.

40:45.133 --> 40:47.433
It's a big table, and
there's a place for you at it

40:47.435 --> 40:49.769
as long as you go with the program.

40:49.771 --> 40:52.171
Have I made myself completely clear?

40:53.641 --> 40:55.941
This office is your home now.

40:57.779 --> 41:00.746
I'll see you in the morning.
We've got a lot of work to do.
