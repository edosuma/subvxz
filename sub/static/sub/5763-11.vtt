00:00.168 --> 00:02.835
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

00:04.802 --> 00:07.857
No! Please! Not you.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.408
I'm so empty without you.

00:09.476 --> 00:10.476
And I'm not going anywhere.

00:10.476 --> 00:11.477
You have to cross over.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.545
I don't want to.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.421
Jim, no.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.058
- You're back. - Do I know you?

00:26.126 --> 00:28.461
Look, I see the same guy that you see,

00:28.461 --> 00:30.796
different hair, nose, eyes.It's not Jim.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.516
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes.

00:33.516 --> 00:36.168
And Jim, he's in there somewhere.He just has to be.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.671
It's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.106
And you could live there while you do the work.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.174
Just until you figure out your next move.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.130
Will you tell me what's going on between us.

00:45.165 --> 00:46.756
Do you know how lucky you are?

00:46.774 --> 00:49.582
You're going to get a second shot at your one true love.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.236
I bought that less than a month ago.

00:53.236 --> 00:55.688
Question is who did I buy it for?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:22.093 --> 01:23.810
Phones are finally turned on.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.527
And I checked the faucets,and the water's running.

01:25.562 --> 01:28.345
Almost got lost on my back way here, this place is huge.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.334
So is the commission if I land a sale.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.920
These people must be loaded,

01:33.920 --> 01:35.661
I can't believe they just left all this.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.692
I know it happened sometimes.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.452
So what if the new owners don't like their stuff?

01:40.487 --> 01:43.118
I guess we auction it off for charity.

01:43.153 --> 01:45.612
Can I bit a dollar on the Xbox in the den?

01:45.781 --> 01:49.441
No.But you can help me take all the pictures off the wall.

01:52.795 --> 01:55.651
- Is this them? The Bancrofts.  - Yeah.

01:55.686 --> 01:57.258
They left their pictures, too?

01:57.293 --> 01:59.000
That's why we're packing all these up.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.608
Because I'm sure they're gonna want some of these.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.877
The walls are going to look pretty blank.

02:02.912 --> 02:04.535
Well, you know, buyers like

02:04.535 --> 02:06.158
to picture themselves in a house.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.377
That's why Melinda is going to get

02:08.377 --> 02:10.529
some prints to fill everything up.

02:10.597 --> 02:15.747
That reminds me.I have got to go.Pick her up.

02:15.782 --> 02:18.037
I need you to do me a favor.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
Cut the grass.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.380
The lawn-mower is outside back in the shed, ok?

02:23.415 --> 02:25.103
People normally charge for that, you know?

02:25.202 --> 02:28.964
Well...how does free room and board sound?

02:28.999 --> 02:30.391
Fine.

02:30.391 --> 02:32.080
I'm gonna take off for now.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.770
But I'm just gonna be gone for about an hour.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.688
Come on, come on, Come on, hurry.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.079
911, what is your emergency?

03:50.079 --> 03:51.430
Can you verify the location for me?

03:51.498 --> 03:52.665
Sir, I need you to apply pressure to the wound.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.799
Everything will be ok. Help is on the way.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.935
911, what is your emergency?

03:56.002 --> 03:58.649
We need help! Please send an ambulance.

03:58.684 --> 04:02.822
I've got your location, sir. 4225 Avalon Circle, is that correct?

04:02.857 --> 04:05.068
He's bleeding, it's really bad... God!

04:05.068 --> 04:07.279
Ok, I'm dispatching an ambulance right now.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.215
Can you tell me, is the victim conscious?

04:09.282 --> 04:11.550
Yes, It rolled over him, the lawn mower, he's...

04:11.550 --> 04:13.819
Sir, can you tell me if he is breathing?

04:13.887 --> 04:19.825
He's all cut up! 4225 Avalon Circle ... Please!

04:21.361 --> 04:23.996
You'll see the staging is basically done for us.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.399
None of the things seems the least big strange to you?

04:26.466 --> 04:29.502
They left all their family photos behind. I mean, who does that?

04:29.569 --> 04:32.805
As long as the commission check clears, I don't really care.

04:39.993 --> 04:42.778
Is this the house you're selling?

04:43.734 --> 04:45.784
Where is Ned?

04:48.047 --> 04:49.185
What happened?

04:49.220 --> 04:50.923
We got a call about an accident-kid hurt by a lawn- mower.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.758
My God!

04:53.460 --> 04:58.197
Ned! Ned, Ned!

04:58.265 --> 04:59.615
And you do not have the keys to the house?

04:59.615 --> 05:00.966
No, just the shed.

05:00.966 --> 05:01.300
No, just the shed.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.900
I swear I didn't make that call.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.000
Ned! Are you ok?!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.700
I'm fine. I don't know what they're talking about.

05:06.700 --> 05:07.700
Hey, Bobby, What's going on?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.100
- Melinda, How are you?  - I'm ok.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.100
We got a 9-1-1 call from this address.

05:11.100 --> 05:11.800
It wasn't me.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.100
Could anyone else have used the phone?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.400
This is my listing, nobody else has the key.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.300
What about the sellers?

05:16.300 --> 05:17.800
No, We changed the lock.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.600
Your son said he didn't see anyone go in.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.700
I was out here mowing the lawn,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.200
So maybe I just didn't notice.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.300
What was the emergency?

05:23.300 --> 05:25.300
Caller said someone got badly cut

05:25.300 --> 05:27.000
by the blades of a lawnmower.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.200
I looked around.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.600
There's no one else in there.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.300
Must have been a prank.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.400
Yeah, it wasn't a prank.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.000
Somebody did need help,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.800
They just didn't get to him in time.

06:17.100 --> 06:17.700
That's him.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.600
That's the boy that I saw in the yard.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.500
That's the Bancroft's youngest son Josh.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
Well, It's a good bet he died at the house, then.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.700
No, I just went over all the sales paperwork,

06:26.700 --> 06:30.200
and the Bancrofts never disclosed a death on their property.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.100
Well, It's not exactly a well-kept secret.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.200
Listen to this article from 2 years ago-

06:34.200 --> 06:35.700
"14 year old Josh Bancroft

06:35.700 --> 06:37.400
"died in an accident at his family's home

06:37.400 --> 06:39.400
"riding a lawnmower. Severe lacerations,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.300
Paramedics were unable to revive him."

06:41.300 --> 06:43.800
That is horrible. I can't even imagine it.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.900
But why would the boy still be there?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.600
Well, Bobby was sure that the call

06:48.600 --> 06:50.100
was made from the house phone,

06:50.100 --> 06:52.000
And the kid seemed fixated on the paramedics.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I think the ghost called 9-1-1.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.100
A ghost that uses the telephone?

06:56.400 --> 06:59.000
Those calls are recorded in some sort of databank,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.100
and ghosts manipulate electronics all the time.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.200
I just had that line turned on yesterday.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.000
So maybe when Ned fired up that mower,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.300
It provoked the ghost.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.700
And what, he's calling for help?

07:08.700 --> 07:10.300
well, he might not realize it's too late.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.100
Someone needs to tell him that he's dead and it's time to move on.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.800
Well, Could you?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.400
I have an open house in just a few days,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.500
and the market is tough enough as it is.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.900
Yes, I'll get right on it, just as soon-

07:25.400 --> 07:26.700
Who's he talking to?

07:26.700 --> 07:28.000
This is going to drive me nuts.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.400
What?

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
He's trying to figure out

07:30.400 --> 07:31.900
Who he bought that engagement ring for.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.000
I mean,He could be talking to her right now!

07:34.100 --> 07:35.400
Who,  he fiancee?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.400
She is not his fiancee until he puts a ring on her finger.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.300
It's ok, honey, Just breathe.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.100
I know that he just wants to find her

07:43.100 --> 07:45.500
and tell her that he didn't fall off the face of the earth.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.800
That's right. There's really nothing to worry about.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.500
He's just trying to make peace with his past.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.400
Yeah, but his past isn't Sam's.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.300
He's Jim. I'm his past.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.100
Bye, Delia.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.800
I know. It's been too long.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.700
Yeah, me, too.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.700
I promise you're going to hear

08:05.700 --> 08:07.300
a lot more from me from now on.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.600
and Jordan, you know, please tell mom and dad I said bye, ok?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.100
Thanks. hi.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.100
Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.800
How's your sister?

08:19.300 --> 08:20.400
Jordan's great, you know?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.900
Things between her and my parents are really good now.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.600
Great. So did she ever get you any answers?

08:26.900 --> 08:28.000
You know, about the ring?

08:28.200 --> 08:31.200
Are you still trying to figure out who you bought it for?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.100
no.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.400
Jordan put a lot of things together for me.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.400
Well, Great. So...

08:40.600 --> 08:42.100
Can I ask you a question?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.300
When you met your husband Jim,

08:44.500 --> 08:45.900
Did you know right away?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.000
I mean, Could you tell he was the one?

08:50.800 --> 08:51.900
Yes.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.700
Jordan says it wasn't like that at all with me and Nicole.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.200
- She's my   - Girlfriend.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.600
Right. She said it was 8 years of on again, off again,

09:01.600 --> 09:04.000
on again until I finally got the ultimatum,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.300
Let's get married or get out of here.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.700
So by the looks of my new zip code,

09:07.700 --> 09:09.200
I chose door number 2.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
But even though you moved here, you bought a ring.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.900
Yeah, Which I then stowed in a safety deposit box.

09:14.900 --> 09:18.000
So... It looks like I flaked on her again.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.700
Yeah, or maybe, maybe-

09:25.200 --> 09:26.900
Maybe you just hadn't decided yet.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.000
Too many maybes, huh?

09:31.300 --> 09:32.600
See you later.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.300
Hey, Can you hand me the runner for the centerpiece?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.100
So you haven't met the family yet?

09:40.100 --> 09:43.200
No, just their lawyers, who threatened to fire me

09:43.200 --> 09:44.500
When I asked why their son's death

09:44.500 --> 09:45.800
wasn't on the disclosure form.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.700
Well, I'm sure they'd rather get sued

09:47.700 --> 09:49.000
then have someone ask them about it.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.700
But you know, even the best lawyers

09:50.700 --> 09:52.500
can't stop neighborhood gossip.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.900
Is he here?

09:57.100 --> 09:57.800
No.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.200
No, Speak freely.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.200
Ok. Well, Another realtor in my office

10:02.200 --> 10:04.100
Said that she heard that Mr. Bancroft

10:04.100 --> 10:06.200
was driving the mower when his son died.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.700
No wonder they left everything.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, everything but their memories.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.500
You know, It's just so sad.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.000
The whole family falls apart, the parents get a divorce,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.300
and then their son moves hundreds

10:19.300 --> 10:22.400
of miles away to go to Strathmore university.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.000
Do you hear that?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.100
What?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
We had a good idea it was a prank

10:28.100 --> 10:30.000
When we got the same call from the same house.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.300
Well, Do you know who placed the call?

10:31.300 --> 10:32.700
Was it a woman or a man?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.300
Dispatch said it was an adult male.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.800
What's weird is, his side of the call was exactly the same.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.000
No matter what he was asked, he used the same words

10:39.000 --> 10:40.800
as the call yesterday, verbatim.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.000
What the hell is going on here?

10:48.100 --> 10:48.900
I - I don't know.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.200
I put a call into the phone company,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.100
and I'm hoping they might have some answers.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.300
We can send more patrol over to help you watch the house.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.300
- Whatever you can do to help. - Ok.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.500
Josh, I'm sorry.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.200
It's-It's too late.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.400
They can't save you, you're already dead.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.400
Why are you here?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
To help you,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.300
Cause I know that you're confused.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.900
You're the one who's confused.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.700
Josh... Your family moved on.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.800
You should, too.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.200
No. That's wrong.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.600
They're running away, but they can't escape.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.600
They're running away, but they can't escape...

11:56.600 --> 11:58.000
What does that mean?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.600
I don't know, I think maybe he wants them to come home?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.500
I mean, they split up after he died,

12:02.500 --> 12:05.200
So maybe he thinks showing his presence in that way

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
will get them back together again.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.400
Yeah, but that's a tall order.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.900
The lawyer says he can't even get the parents

12:09.900 --> 12:11.400
in the same room together.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.300
And what about those phone calls, anyway?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.000
Bobby said that it was a man.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.100
I think he's resending his original 9-1-1 calls from the accident,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.600
And the caller, it had to have been his father.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.400
Can you imagine the guilt?

12:24.100 --> 12:26.800
- So what happens now? - I don't know.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.000
But I won't know what we're up against

12:28.000 --> 12:29.700
until I get to know the family better.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.800
Hi, Mrs. Bancroft,

12:39.800 --> 12:40.800
I have a delivery for you.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.300
Well, please, come on in.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.200
Thank you.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.100
My name is Melinda Gordon. I'm friends with Delia,

12:46.100 --> 12:47.600
who's selling your grandview house,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.200
And I've been helping her stage it.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.200
Anyway, when I saw this, um,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.200
I thought that you would want it.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.000
Thank you for coming all the way out here,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.100
But, uh, no, I don't, actually...

13:02.700 --> 13:04.200
want this.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.700
Would you tell your friend

13:05.700 --> 13:07.100
that I don't want anything

13:07.100 --> 13:08.300
from that house?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.600
Ok, Well, I'm sorry for the confusion.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.100
I guess your style here is different.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.500
It's lovely.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.400
Thank you.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.800
I just needed a change.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.900
A fresh start.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.400
I've been feeling the same way recently.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.300
I just lost my husband, so...

13:29.700 --> 13:31.300
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.500
So am I. About your son.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.800
How did you get through it?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.700
I just... knew he'd be with me.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.100
Wherever I went.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.700
And...

13:47.400 --> 13:48.500
He is.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.900
What about you?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.600
Do you feel like...

13:55.200 --> 13:57.100
Here that your son is with you?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.400
Well, he's in my heart always.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.600
But I didn't move

14:04.600 --> 14:06.700
to escape the memory of my son.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.000
My older son, he's in college,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.600
And my husband and I are...

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
divorced, and...

14:14.100 --> 14:15.900
I did try not to blame him.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.200
But I just, I couldn't help it.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.300
Do you know we had the same argument

14:21.300 --> 14:23.300
about parenting for 20 years?

14:23.300 --> 14:25.600
Doug thought that I was too strict,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
and I thought that he was too lenient,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.300
And...

14:29.400 --> 14:31.100
And I was gone for an hour.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.500
For one hour.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.100
Well, you can't blame yourself.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.100
Oh, I don't. I blame Doug.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.500
He is the reason that my son is dead.

14:45.900 --> 14:46.800
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. See ya.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.400
Ok, I'll see you later.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.872
- Hi, Sam.  - Ned, how is it going?

15:03.872 --> 15:05.940
Good, just here to do some statistics homework.

15:06.008 --> 15:08.176
- You?   - Statistics? Brutal.

15:10.104 --> 15:12.747
Wait a minute. Can you help me?

15:12.815 --> 15:17.318
I'm trying to get into my E-mail but I forgot my password

15:17.386 --> 15:19.153
When I guess when I forgot everything else in my life.

15:19.221 --> 15:21.111
What have you tried?

15:21.146 --> 15:25.059
My birthday, my Alma Mater, my family dog's name,

15:25.127 --> 15:26.995
Every scrap of information anyone's ever given me.

15:27.062 --> 15:29.297
You might have allowed your browser to save your passwords,

15:29.365 --> 15:31.266
Especially if you are working behind a firewall.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.067
That sounds dangerous.

15:34.937 --> 15:36.805
All right.Here is your password file.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.673
Let's just hope it's not encrypted.

15:43.212 --> 15:46.381
- You are in luck.  - No kidding.

15:46.448 --> 15:48.783
- Thanks Ned. - FYI ...

15:48.851 --> 15:52.620
- Your password is "password".  - Yeah.

15:52.688 --> 15:57.091
Work, more work. Spam, a lot spam.

15:58.328 --> 16:01.906
And apparently I am really bad at fantasy football.

16:01.941 --> 16:04.508
- Looking for something specific?  - I do not know.

16:04.601 --> 16:09.037
I guess I'm looking for somebody to tell me what I was looking for.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.774
Hey, black coffee, please.

16:13.042 --> 16:16.477
Maybe I could tell me what I was looking for.

16:16.545 --> 16:19.279
Yeah, that's great, thank you.

16:22.287 --> 16:24.819
"Nicole, I know you're mad, but this time is different "

16:24.887 --> 16:27.822
"I bought the ring, I am ready"

16:28.650 --> 16:31.242
"I love you, Sam."

16:31.627 --> 16:37.466
- Who is Nicole72?  - I do not remember.

16:37.933 --> 16:40.802
But it looks like that it was ready to marry her.

16:41.838 --> 16:43.517
If the ghost wants his family to be together again,

16:43.517 --> 16:45.197
It's getting be waiting a long time.

16:45.242 --> 16:47.958
- Yep, but it was an accident.  - Not in her mind.

16:47.959 --> 16:50.134
I mean, She blames the father completely.

16:50.135 --> 16:53.681
It was like the last in a series of very irresponsible moves.

16:54.717 --> 16:58.086
Maybe just a inch that way.

16:58.888 --> 17:02.791
You know, well, if Josh felt the same way,

17:02.792 --> 17:06.227
Maybe that's what he meant when he said they were running away.

17:06.295 --> 17:10.031
Maybe he thinks his father's running away is from his guilt.

17:10.098 --> 17:13.343
Yes, or maybe not.

17:13.670 --> 17:15.736
He came.

17:19.942 --> 17:23.612
I guess I did not realize that we'd left so much behind.

17:23.878 --> 17:25.880
Melinda has been helping me style the house.

17:25.883 --> 17:28.077
She spoke with your wife to see

17:28.077 --> 17:30.272
if she wanted to keep any of the collectables.

17:30.307 --> 17:35.124
- Is there anything you'd like to keep?  - You saw Elena ...

17:35.791 --> 17:36.891
How is she?

17:37.334 --> 17:40.361
She seemed eager to sell the house.

17:41.324 --> 17:43.098
Well, I'm gonna be sorry to see it go.

17:43.165 --> 17:49.004
Even with everything that happened, we were a family.

17:49.371 --> 17:52.039
We were happy here.

17:54.543 --> 17:56.211
I'm so sorry.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.681
I know that you lost your son here.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.360
I still feel him aound me.

18:06.395 --> 18:11.245
- Is that crazy?  - No.

18:16.572 --> 18:19.934
If you could ... talk to him.

18:22.324 --> 18:24.944
What would you say?

18:28.010 --> 18:30.412
Do you have any idea how he died?

18:31.147 --> 18:34.183
There was so much blood ...

18:35.051 --> 18:39.654
You just can't believe that there's that much blood inside anyone.

18:45.127 --> 18:48.462
Josh had watched me teach Devin to drive.

18:49.399 --> 18:52.867
Like any kid brother,he was jealous as hell.

18:54.737 --> 18:56.838
Come on Dad, I wanna try it.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.206
I figured what would it hurt him

18:58.206 --> 18:59.507
to give him a chance to steer.

18:59.575 --> 19:01.745
So I let him sit with me.

19:01.780 --> 19:05.446
I thought it was safe. It was a bad call.

19:06.382 --> 19:08.783
We lost control.

19:08.870 --> 19:11.286
Josh! Josh!

19:11.354 --> 19:12.754
And I lost Josh.

19:12.822 --> 19:16.758
Josh! Josh! God!

19:16.826 --> 19:19.461
God!

19:19.863 --> 19:23.664
My boy, my boy, my boy!

19:25.487 --> 19:30.005
I would give anything to take him back, anything.

19:30.072 --> 19:32.206
Liar.

19:34.176 --> 19:36.244
Excuse me.

19:37.179 --> 19:38.480
Hello?

19:38.547 --> 19:39.631
911, what is your emergency?

19:39.631 --> 19:40.715
We need help!

19:40.783 --> 19:43.350
Please send an ambulance!

19:47.701 --> 19:49.582
We need help! Please!

19:49.617 --> 19:51.158
What's going on?

19:51.794 --> 19:53.728
We need help! Please!

19:53.767 --> 19:55.234
It is the same 911 call.

19:56.402 --> 20:00.303
Why is this happening?  Why won't it stop?

20:01.571 --> 20:03.705
Please stop this.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.773
In Avalon Circle, please!

20:09.374 --> 20:14.149
These phone calls you've received them before, since when?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.886
For a couple of days, Why won't they stop?

20:17.954 --> 20:21.123
You are hurting him ... Why are you doing this?

20:21.190 --> 20:23.058
He knows why.

20:23.126 --> 20:26.728
Wait a minute, who were you talking to? What's going on here?

20:31.901 --> 20:34.869
This has gonna stop.

20:42.572 --> 20:45.376
- Hello?  - Hey, Bobby, It's Melinda.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.249
Listen, are you on your way to the Bancroft's house?

20:47.316 --> 20:48.884
- Yeah, I am.  - Yeah, I know it.

20:48.951 --> 20:50.615
I just want to tell you it's a false alarm.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.500
Thanks for the head's up,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.021
But we're headed in that direction,anyway.

20:53.089 --> 20:54.289
One of the neighbors went out to get her mail

20:54.289 --> 20:55.490
comes back in with palpitations.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.559
- Why? What happened?  - You're at the house, right?

20:57.627 --> 21:00.495
- Yeah.  - 4227 Avalon Circle?

21:00.563 --> 21:02.630
Take a look at the lawn.

21:07.466 --> 21:12.746
Help me

21:20.147 --> 21:22.317
- Help me.  - Yes, help me.

21:22.319 --> 21:23.953
As if the 911 calls weren't enough.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.789
He seared his plea into the neighbor's lawn.

21:26.857 --> 21:30.025
No, I understood that part, I mean help me,it's my only tie.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.464
Sorry.

21:34.831 --> 21:36.465
Well, it's interesting to see that the ghosts

21:36.466 --> 21:38.100
is branching out in the new media.

21:38.168 --> 21:40.169
Yeah, but why?

21:40.169 --> 21:42.171
I mean is he worried that this phone call is going unheard?

21:42.239 --> 21:44.574
They sure got his father's attention.

21:44.609 --> 21:46.108
Has the ghost tried to call anyone else?

21:46.176 --> 21:48.844
Mr. Bancroft said he has not heard from his son on the subject.

21:48.912 --> 21:51.547
- How about the mum?  - I do not think so.

21:51.615 --> 21:53.166
I gave her plenty of chances to talk about£¬

21:53.166 --> 21:54.717
Bumps in the night,she didn't take the bait.

21:54.785 --> 21:57.319
So it seems like the ghost has a beef with the old man.

21:57.387 --> 21:58.487
But why?

21:58.555 --> 22:01.991
I mean to make Mr. Bancroft feel...

22:02.058 --> 22:04.994
even more guilty for causing his death?

22:05.061 --> 22:06.645
I mean, the guy is so guilt-ridden already,

22:06.645 --> 22:08.230
What's the point?

22:08.298 --> 22:10.221
"Help me"

22:12.167 --> 22:14.020
Blot, don't rub.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.239
No, this time makes me mulling the concept.

22:17.307 --> 22:19.008
Maybe it is not about blame,

22:19.008 --> 22:20.709
Maybe the ghost is asking for something.

22:20.777 --> 22:22.962
And we're just not getting it?

22:22.962 --> 22:25.147
I mean, he does keep sending the phone call,

22:25.215 --> 22:27.504
Maybe there's something we're not hearing.

22:27.539 --> 22:30.764
You were right, calls we've been getting was a recording

22:30.765 --> 22:32.377
of an original call back in 2006.

22:32.377 --> 22:33.989
I got this copy from a buddy at dispatch.

22:34.357 --> 22:37.400
- How did you know about the accident?  - I know the family.

22:37.495 --> 22:39.045
It's a shame.

22:39.045 --> 22:40.596
Do you have any idea where these calls are coming from?

22:40.664 --> 22:42.398
- No.  - Do you?

22:42.466 --> 22:44.600
I'm just trying to help the family.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.475
911, what is your emergency?

22:52.542 --> 22:54.176
We need help! Send an ambulance!

22:54.244 --> 22:55.911
Can you can tell me what happened, sir?

22:55.979 --> 22:59.115
Yeah, It's rolled over him, the lawn mower. He's all cut off.

22:59.182 --> 23:02.135
Can you verify the location for me?

23:02.135 --> 23:05.088
Yes, 4225 Avalon Circle. Please!

23:05.956 --> 23:07.223
The ambulance is on its way.

23:07.290 --> 23:10.540
I need you to check that the victim is breathing. Can you do that?

23:10.575 --> 23:13.963
I don't know! He's bleeding! It's really bad! God!

23:14.030 --> 23:16.298
Please! Could you please hurry up?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.000
Well hang on .The other one's cued up as well.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.403
The other one?

23:20.470 --> 23:22.089
Came in a couple of minutes before this one,

23:22.089 --> 23:23.709
From a different number.

23:23.744 --> 23:27.576
- 911, what is your emergency?  - No, no, no, no!

23:29.797 --> 23:31.920
Was that Josh's father again?

23:31.955 --> 23:33.100
It is not uncommon for people

23:33.100 --> 23:35.084
to reach for a backup during an emergency.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.768
So then why did he hang up?

23:36.803 --> 23:41.251
Lost reception, had to help his son, I do not know.

23:42.092 --> 23:43.856
Can I keep that?

23:43.891 --> 23:48.597
If it gives you any leads on who's been sending them, let me know.

23:48.665 --> 23:50.298
Thank you.

23:51.334 --> 23:53.018
I hate to bring this up,

23:53.018 --> 23:54.703
But I have a buyer who wants to come to see the house,

23:54.771 --> 23:57.723
So I was just wondering what the next move was

23:57.723 --> 24:00.676
with the occupant.

24:02.356 --> 24:06.749
- I really don't have one.  - Really?

24:07.732 --> 24:10.712
Delia, you're at the house right now,aren't you?

24:10.747 --> 24:12.234
Fine, OK.I'll meet you there.

24:12.234 --> 24:13.722
No, no, no, I'm fine.

24:13.790 --> 24:16.448
I just forgot some papers here.

24:16.483 --> 24:18.816
Besides, you're the one who always say that

24:18.816 --> 24:21.149
ghosts can't really hurt people.

24:21.184 --> 24:23.733
- Right?  - Right.

24:25.869 --> 24:27.970
Do they break windows?

24:27.970 --> 24:30.072
I'm already looking for my car keys.

24:30.140 --> 24:32.752
No, no, no, I'll just have Sam come and fix it.

24:32.787 --> 24:37.466
Besides, it is probably just the ghost, or whatever.

24:37.501 --> 24:39.442
Just got a little annoyed

24:39.442 --> 24:41.383
and probably tousled things around a bit,right?

24:41.451 --> 24:43.169
All he's done so far has been a cry for help,

24:43.169 --> 24:44.887
Just wait on me, okay?

24:44.955 --> 24:46.706
Seriously, I will be there in 10 minutes.

24:46.706 --> 24:48.457
No, It's ok,don't worry.

24:48.458 --> 24:51.460
It's a big deal, make me feel better.

24:53.531 --> 24:57.021
Hey! Did you go inside? I said to wait.

24:57.034 --> 24:59.959
It's fine up here, Okay.

24:59.994 --> 25:02.371
- God!  - Delia?

25:02.439 --> 25:06.408
- Great, the electricity is out.  - What?

25:06.483 --> 25:08.482
That was probably just knocked out by the storm.

25:08.482 --> 25:10.481
I mean,that can happen,right?

25:11.114 --> 25:13.015
Ok, well,I'm just gonna get my paperwork

25:13.015 --> 25:14.917
and get the hell out of here.

25:14.985 --> 25:18.591
OK, but I'm staying on the phone until you do, Hurry up!

25:18.686 --> 25:22.258
- My God!  - What, what? What is it?

25:22.601 --> 25:25.294
- I see something.  - What? Delia?

25:25.362 --> 25:27.547
Hey, if you see something,get out of there!

25:27.547 --> 25:29.732
You can not see ghosts!

25:29.885 --> 25:31.900
Josh?

25:33.684 --> 25:35.678
Delia!

25:35.778 --> 25:38.842
Delia? Where are you?

25:38.877 --> 25:42.032
What happened? Where did you? Delia?

25:42.379 --> 25:45.228
Delia, please!

25:45.263 --> 25:48.184
- Delia?  - I'm sorry, I'm fine.

25:48.252 --> 25:49.547
The phone just got knocked out of me.

25:49.547 --> 25:50.842
What happened?

25:50.855 --> 25:55.334
The table got knocked over, only it wasn't a ghost, it was a guy.

25:55.369 --> 25:59.162
A guy? inside the house? Look, Delia, get out of there.

25:59.230 --> 26:00.847
Ok? I'm gonna call the cops.

26:00.847 --> 26:02.465
No,no. I think it's ok.

26:02.533 --> 26:06.863
I think I know who it is. I'm gonna call you back, ok?

26:14.044 --> 26:17.498
Devin! Is that you?

26:17.533 --> 26:20.616
It's ok, honey. I just want to help you.

26:27.658 --> 26:29.759
- The one is there!  - Get down!

26:29.827 --> 26:31.428
On the ground! get on the ground now!

26:31.428 --> 26:33.029
Hands behind your back!

26:33.097 --> 26:35.165
- Wait, wait, stop!  - Down!

26:35.232 --> 26:38.501
Oh, please don't hurt him! I think he's the Bancroft's son!

26:38.569 --> 26:41.171
Take a step back, ma'am. Take a step back. ok.

26:41.238 --> 26:43.590
You have the right to remain silent.

26:43.591 --> 26:44.766
You give up that right, anything you say can and will be

26:44.766 --> 26:45.942
Used against you in a court of law.

26:45.943 --> 26:47.677
You have a right to have an attorney present

26:47.677 --> 26:49.412
Both before and during any questioning.

26:53.555 --> 26:56.372
Apparently they didn't care that it was his house.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.543
They brought him in on trespassing, breaking and entering,

26:58.578 --> 27:00.444
And now they're questioning him about the vandalism.

27:00.479 --> 27:01.858
- It's the burned lawn.  - Yes.

27:02.105 --> 27:04.994
He's taking the blame for somebody else's handiwork.

27:05.062 --> 27:06.579
Well, maybe we were right.

27:06.579 --> 27:08.097
Maybe Josh is getting exactly what he wanted-

27:08.165 --> 27:10.934
His family back at the house one by one.

27:19.143 --> 27:21.010
Well, that was fast.

27:25.612 --> 27:30.318
Delia. Look, I'm so sorry if my son gave you a scare.

27:30.353 --> 27:32.522
Yeah, everything ok?

27:32.590 --> 27:34.858
It's just crazy they're even charging him.

27:34.859 --> 27:37.126
Our lawyers will get that straightened out.

27:37.194 --> 27:40.430
He was just back on a visit, decided to crash at the old house.

27:40.498 --> 27:43.065
Isn't that right, Devin?

27:46.182 --> 27:47.844
Anyway, we didn't know, and apparently,

27:47.844 --> 27:49.506
The lines got crossed somehow.

27:49.573 --> 27:51.925
Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot lately.

27:51.926 --> 27:54.277
Why did you go home now? Did you get a call, too?

27:54.345 --> 27:56.412
No, he was homesick.It happens.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.242
Yeah, you got a 911 call.

27:58.242 --> 28:00.005
Your brother sent them to both of you.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.946
How could she ...? Who are you?

28:01.946 --> 28:03.853
All right, Devin. Not now okay?

28:03.921 --> 28:06.122
Look, I need to get my son home.

28:06.190 --> 28:08.124
Now, I imagine that you're here to give your statement,

28:08.192 --> 28:10.010
And I'm sure that you're going to explain to the police

28:10.010 --> 28:11.828
About the whole misunderstanding.

28:15.190 --> 28:19.169
This is what always happens. Dad makes things go away.

28:23.407 --> 28:25.859
I've been through every email in my inbox..

28:25.859 --> 28:28.311
Nothing from Nicole.

28:28.379 --> 28:29.642
Can't say I blame her.

28:29.642 --> 28:33.431
What kind of schmoe asks someone to marry them in an email?

28:33.466 --> 28:35.118
Wait, so you think that's why she didn't respond?

28:35.186 --> 28:37.454
No, she responded.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.722
Women don't not respond to marriage proposals.

28:39.790 --> 28:42.135
Of course, the answer can vary

28:42.135 --> 28:44.481
From a giddy yes to a resounding no

28:44.516 --> 28:47.430
Or maybe .If you're willing to work on your narcissism

28:47.498 --> 28:49.032
And latent mommy issues.

28:49.099 --> 28:52.421
She was a colleague. It really didn't work out.

28:52.456 --> 28:55.338
Look, if she did reply, Then why can't I find the email?

28:55.406 --> 28:57.220
Just because you lacked any sense of romance

28:57.221 --> 28:59.035
doesn't mean she did. Maybe she wrote you a letter.

28:59.070 --> 29:02.912
No, no. I've been through all my stuff. There's nothing.

29:02.980 --> 29:06.249
How about a voicemail? Have you checked your phone?

29:06.317 --> 29:10.153
No. I don't know the password, So I can't access the account.

29:10.221 --> 29:13.142
Can't? or don't want to?

29:13.177 --> 29:15.231
Why would I not want to?

29:15.266 --> 29:17.453
Because if she said yes,

29:17.454 --> 29:19.641
You're engaged to somebody you don't even know.

29:19.676 --> 29:22.324
And if the answer's no, you were rejected by the one person

29:22.325 --> 29:24.973
Who could tell you who you were.

29:29.006 --> 29:31.374
- You are a talented shrink.  - Thanks.

29:32.034 --> 29:35.802
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but just so you know,

29:35.837 --> 29:38.305
It only takes a social security number for the phone company

29:38.306 --> 29:40.774
to let you access your messages.

29:54.064 --> 29:56.399
So did she send him a voicemail?

29:56.467 --> 29:58.568
I left it up to him, so I don't know.

29:58.568 --> 30:00.670
And even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

30:00.670 --> 30:02.821
You have to have gotten some idea what he was gonna do.

30:04.123 --> 30:05.306
Fine.

30:11.906 --> 30:13.306
911, what's your emergency?

30:13.324 --> 30:14.390
Is that the 911 call?

30:14.598 --> 30:16.319
Yeah, I just don't know why he's using tape calls

30:16.319 --> 30:17.640
instead of talking to me.

30:19.014 --> 30:20.436
Well, he's been communicating with

30:20.436 --> 30:21.859
the brother and dad same way, too.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.084
Yeah, the two people who were there when he died.

30:24.112 --> 30:25.821
What message is he sending?

30:27.017 --> 30:28.818
You're not gonna believe this. I just came from the house.

30:28.818 --> 30:30.220
The cop's searched it,

30:30.340 --> 30:33.790
and they found Devin's bag pack with a big box of weedkiller in it.

30:34.471 --> 30:36.780
Wait, he trashed the lawn? Not the ghost?

30:36.995 --> 30:39.220
Apparently. The detective told me that

30:39.220 --> 30:40.422
he's having trouble in school,

30:40.450 --> 30:43.470
that he was on the verge of being kicked out. And then 3 days ago,

30:43.957 --> 30:45.000
He just bailed.

30:45.028 --> 30:47.122
That's the same day that the house phone was hooked up.

30:47.150 --> 30:49.657
So he must started getting phone calls and came straight here.

30:49.944 --> 30:50.940
Crying out for help.

30:51.770 --> 30:53.950
Just like his dead brother's doing it on his behalf.

30:55.946 --> 30:56.930
That's it.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.550
It's gotta be the first 911 call.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.750
911, what's your emergency?

31:01.750 --> 31:05.252
No, no, no, no, no, no!

31:05.252 --> 31:06.240
Did you hear that?

31:06.360 --> 31:07.950
His voice got louder.

31:08.210 --> 31:09.790
Yeah, like he was going towards the phone.

31:09.809 --> 31:12.390
So Mr. Bancroft isn't the one who made that call.

31:12.510 --> 31:14.312
Devin was the one calling for help.

31:15.912 --> 31:18.010
It sounds like the old man was trying to stop him.

31:18.907 --> 31:20.034
Why would he do that?

31:20.071 --> 31:21.200
Something Devin did.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.340
Something that a father wouldn't want his son to get blamed for.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.812
Mr. Bancroft, hi, it's Melinda Gordon.

32:45.812 --> 32:48.142
It's really important that we talk. It's about your son, Devin.

32:49.660 --> 32:50.920
Please call back. Okay?

32:51.859 --> 32:53.531
- Hello?  - Hey, Mel, I'm Bobby.

32:53.568 --> 32:55.519
Please tell me not another 911 call.

32:55.944 --> 32:57.624
This time a call from a neighbor.

32:57.624 --> 32:59.305
Said they saw a kid jumped off the roof.

33:01.013 --> 33:01.783
Devin!

33:07.677 --> 33:09.380
Please, please .Please, please.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.399
Help! Somebody help us!

33:30.039 --> 33:31.560
Call 911!

33:32.053 --> 33:33.650
They're on their way, a neighbor called.

33:33.853 --> 33:35.170
Melinda, I need you to listen carefully.

33:35.489 --> 33:36.949
I've reduced the shoulder dislocation,

33:36.949 --> 33:38.410
but he needs to be immobilized.

33:38.621 --> 33:40.884
Can you go in the house and bring me a blanket and two towels?

33:42.014 --> 33:43.490
And a lot of magazines.

33:44.111 --> 33:44.840
Magazines?

33:44.881 --> 33:46.486
The thicker, the better. I have to build a splint.

33:46.486 --> 33:47.491
The arm might be broken.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.522
- Melinda, quickly, please.  - All right!

33:54.814 --> 33:57.170
You gotta be still, you could still damage the nerves in your arms.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.240
You're gonna be okay. Don't move.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.230
You'll be all right. My name is Sam. You'll be all right.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.400
He was lucky you were here.

34:15.753 --> 34:17.120
Yeah, I guess so.

34:17.406 --> 34:19.058
Where'd you learn to make field splints?

34:23.934 --> 34:25.449
Guess I just see stuffs on TV.

34:30.078 --> 34:31.810
So how is that feel?

34:32.250 --> 34:33.580
He needed help, I helped him.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.239
How did it feel to remember? I mean,

34:36.719 --> 34:38.277
that stuff had to come from some place.

34:38.315 --> 34:39.764
I know I was an architect.

34:39.764 --> 34:41.216
Why would I know about emergency medicine?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.620
I know that you feel strange, but it's progress.

34:44.944 --> 34:46.643
I mean, you have to believe that

34:46.643 --> 34:48.342
it's all gonna come back now, right?

34:58.148 --> 34:59.575
It was an accident. He fell.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.740
What was he doing up there?

35:03.490 --> 35:05.280
What was he even doing at the house?

35:05.899 --> 35:08.350
And vandalizing other people's lawns?

35:10.445 --> 35:13.170
Doug, he needs help. Can you see that?

35:13.941 --> 35:15.443
Someone has seen it.

35:17.948 --> 35:19.835
Someone who loves you very much.

35:21.980 --> 35:23.290
Your brother.

35:25.262 --> 35:27.703
I'm sorry, Ms. Gordon. Isn't it?

35:28.267 --> 35:30.269
This really is not a good time for visitors.

35:30.288 --> 35:32.044
Yeah, I couldn't disagree more.

35:32.410 --> 35:34.504
Josh's been waiting to see you all together.

35:34.504 --> 35:36.598
It's something he's been wanting for quite some time.

35:38.572 --> 35:41.750
If there's anything you want to say, Josh, this is your chance.

35:42.817 --> 35:44.380
Tell them to stop fighting.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.188
Please, not now. Okay?

35:46.216 --> 35:47.239
Josh ...

35:47.446 --> 35:48.862
Tell them to count to 3 fingers.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.530
He wants you to count to 3 fingers.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.478
Well, that's what Uncle Chip said

35:53.478 --> 35:54.807
whenever he got on fight with Aunt Pansy.

35:55.474 --> 35:58.470
You know,3 fingers? How much liquor to put in your drink.

36:00.470 --> 36:02.650
It's what Uncle Chip would say to Aunt Pansy.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.540
Oh. My God.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.074
And, and he's really still here?

36:15.560 --> 36:17.470
Josh! What is he saying?

36:18.239 --> 36:19.519
Why can they just talk?

36:19.519 --> 36:21.400
Why can't they just say what they're feeling?

36:22.090 --> 36:23.987
He wished you guys could just talk.

36:24.107 --> 36:27.113
It's been really hard for him watching his whole family fall apart.

36:29.340 --> 36:30.626
Over a lie.

36:32.654 --> 36:34.280
What? What lie?

36:35.150 --> 36:37.553
Josh, if you're really here,

36:37.673 --> 36:40.342
then I know you'll want what is best for us, for all of us.

36:40.370 --> 36:42.450
Dad, stop it! You're not helping!

36:43.110 --> 36:45.850
It was too late to help me then, and I know you were trying,

36:46.110 --> 36:47.320
but you're not helping!

36:47.635 --> 36:48.903
You're not!

36:54.227 --> 36:55.490
It was me.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.020
What?

37:01.980 --> 37:06.030
That accident. It wasn't dad's fault, mom. It was mine.

37:11.163 --> 37:12.640
Dad wasn't even there.

37:13.229 --> 37:15.870
Dad was inside, working. The driving lesson was over.

37:18.565 --> 37:21.030
Josh was begging for a dirt riding,

37:21.382 --> 37:23.020
so I let him sit with me.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.120
Come on! Go faster!

37:26.160 --> 37:30.995
- No! - Come on, Dev. Let me steer.

37:30.995 --> 37:33.420
Then he wanted to steer, and I kept telling him no, but ...

37:36.337 --> 37:37.679
I won't listen.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.911
So I grabbed the wheel.

37:41.067 --> 37:43.435
- Stop!  - Devin, let me steer!

37:43.435 --> 37:45.535
- Josh  - Come on!

37:46.535 --> 37:47.235
No!

37:47.235 --> 37:49.435
Josh!

37:58.624 --> 38:01.609
Josh! Josh!

38:02.412 --> 38:04.590
Dad heard the screams,and he came out and found us.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.490
- 911, what's your emergency?  - No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

38:16.758 --> 38:18.650
He grabbed my phone when I called 911.

38:21.550 --> 38:22.975
Josh...

38:22.985 --> 38:24.117
Then called himself.

38:24.117 --> 38:26.650
Made me promise to say I was inside studying.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.190
Why?

38:31.230 --> 38:32.890
Why did you lie to me?

38:33.402 --> 38:35.410
Because I thought...

38:36.290 --> 38:38.300
You'd already lost one child.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.410
You don't want me to... lose the other?

38:45.336 --> 38:47.610
Because you thought that I couldn't forgive him.

38:48.163 --> 38:49.891
You didn't give her a chance.

38:52.557 --> 38:53.965
And ever since that,

38:54.200 --> 38:56.313
The lie, it's been killing me, Dad.

39:01.608 --> 39:03.495
- I know what I did was... - Devin

39:04.540 --> 39:05.890
It was a mistake.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.130
A stupid mistake.

39:09.873 --> 39:11.873
But lying to mom about it made me feel...

39:15.239 --> 39:16.675
Unforgivable.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.571
But I'm the one who should be mad at.

39:25.815 --> 39:27.693
Not Devin, not Dad.

39:29.029 --> 39:30.680
It was my mistake.

39:32.187 --> 39:34.100
Josh feels like it was his fault.

39:34.220 --> 39:35.174
Josh, no!

39:35.418 --> 39:36.620
It was!

39:37.159 --> 39:38.746
And it racked everything.

39:40.792 --> 39:43.046
You guys are all apart now because of me.

39:44.428 --> 39:46.503
He feels like he destroyed your family.

39:47.540 --> 39:50.630
Josh. It was nobody's fault.

39:50.963 --> 39:53.940
And I love you. Both of you.

40:01.427 --> 40:02.601
Even if I ...

40:04.084 --> 40:06.113
Even if I have to go away?

40:07.478 --> 40:09.500
He wants to know if you will still love him

40:13.040 --> 40:14.870
even if he has to go away

40:15.739 --> 40:17.300
Yes.

40:18.008 --> 40:19.519
Even if you'd leave us.

40:23.332 --> 40:24.694
I saw that once before.

40:27.557 --> 40:28.684
Is that for me?

40:31.162 --> 40:32.815
But I don't want them to be alone.

40:35.754 --> 40:38.082
He doesn't want you all to be alone.

40:42.776 --> 40:44.213
We're not alone.

40:49.849 --> 40:51.493
Because we have each other.

40:52.976 --> 40:55.361
And we will always be a family.

40:55.605 --> 40:56.601
No matter what.

41:06.763 --> 41:08.068
He's gone.

41:23.031 --> 41:26.102
All right.It's less than the asking price, but it's an offer,

41:26.222 --> 41:27.701
and they obviously love the place,

41:27.701 --> 41:29.580
because it's their third time coming back.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.939
Third time? You own there. They are hooked.

41:33.059 --> 41:34.140
Listen, if I make the sale,

41:34.630 --> 41:37.310
I want you to celebrate with me at the SPA. It is my treat.

41:37.430 --> 41:38.751
I totally owe you one.

41:38.770 --> 41:39.597
It's a deal.

41:39.850 --> 41:41.991
And speaking of coming back,

41:42.188 --> 41:44.252
Has there been any memory breakthrough for Sam?

41:44.288 --> 41:47.520
I'm not sure, but you know what?

41:47.557 --> 41:49.610
I just feel like Jim is in there somewhere, waiting to come out.

41:50.499 --> 41:52.537
And now is the perfect time to find out.

41:52.565 --> 41:54.330
I want details. Call me later, bye.

41:56.182 --> 41:57.084
Sam!

41:59.118 --> 41:59.832
Sam?

42:00.292 --> 42:01.980
Oh, hey. Hi, Melinda.

42:02.178 --> 42:03.267
- Hey...here. - Thanks.

42:05.340 --> 42:07.180
Seems like you have a lot of new mind lately.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.082
Yeah.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.980
I mean it's just a lot of stuff that doesn't fit.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.326
Shoulder pain, weird violent memories and

42:13.345 --> 42:15.035
the inexplicable medical knowledge.

42:15.063 --> 42:16.453
But you know what I'm going to do what you told me.

42:16.453 --> 42:17.843
I'm gonna find somebody who understands me.

42:18.042 --> 42:19.121
Well, that's great.

42:19.241 --> 42:21.062
I mean, Eli said that he wanted you to try

42:21.062 --> 42:23.084
the past life regression therapy. So...

42:23.121 --> 42:25.050
I think I'm gonna talk to somebody who ...

42:25.506 --> 42:26.940
actually knows where the stuff is coming from.

42:27.509 --> 42:28.180
Like?

42:29.134 --> 42:29.960
Nicole.

42:30.787 --> 42:32.777
I mean I was with her for almost a decade. So...

42:33.343 --> 42:34.720
You know,who would know me better?

42:35.957 --> 42:37.385
That's a good question.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.150
Yeah, so I'm gonna go to Raleigh. Thanks.

42:41.029 --> 42:42.447
So that's what all this is for?

42:42.644 --> 42:43.405
Yeah.

42:43.805 --> 42:46.894
I'm leaving tomorrow. I don't know how long I'm gonna be gone.

42:56.271 --> 42:57.463
Wish me luck.

42:59.837 --> 43:00.790
See you.
