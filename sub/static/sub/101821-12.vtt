WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.794
We're not doing this,

00:02.836 --> 00:04.838
telling you what happened
on  Shameless  last week anymore.

00:04.879 --> 00:06.548
-We're sick of it.
-Yeah, we quit.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.258
-It's over.
-Just not doin' it.

00:08.299 --> 00:11.553
-It insults your intelligence.
-They don't pay us enough.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.931
What, they pay you guys
for this?

00:14.973 --> 00:16.474
-Yeah. You don't get paid?
-[Debbie] Are you kidding?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.727
-[Ian] Of course.
-Well, fuck me!

00:18.768 --> 00:21.354
[all snickering]

00:28.445 --> 00:31.448
rock music

00:35.118 --> 00:38.204
Think of all
the luck you got

00:38.246 --> 00:41.666
Know that
it's not for naught

00:41.708 --> 00:44.711
You were beaming
once before

00:44.753 --> 00:49.007
But it's not like that
anymore

00:49.049 --> 00:52.635
What is this downside

00:52.677 --> 00:55.930
That you speak of?

00:55.972 --> 00:57.974
What is this feeling

00:58.016 --> 01:02.979
You're so sure of?

01:09.235 --> 01:13.031
Round up
the friends you got

01:13.073 --> 01:15.950
Know that
they're not for naught

01:15.992 --> 01:19.037
You were willing
once before

01:19.079 --> 01:23.750
But it's not like that
anymore

01:23.792 --> 01:26.878
What is this downside

01:26.920 --> 01:30.465
That you speak of?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.550
What is this feeling

01:32.592 --> 01:36.596
You're so sure of?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.851
[Lip] Is he dead?

01:41.893 --> 01:43.645
Faint pulse.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.563
-Hypoxic.
-High what?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.982
-Barely breathing.
-What's that smell?

01:48.024 --> 01:50.026
Grampy went tinkle
in his pants.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.612
Ugh, damn it.
Not on the new couch.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.489
Hey, what's goin' on?

01:54.531 --> 01:55.990
Frank OD'd again.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.744
[Ian] How much heroin
did he do?

02:03.164 --> 02:04.415
-Wow.
-[Ian] Oh.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.500
And he's not dead?

02:05.542 --> 02:06.918
[Lip] Yet another disadvantage

02:06.960 --> 02:09.170
to decades of copious
narcotics use.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.839
Should we, like, call
the paramedics or something?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.049
No, he's done this before
a bunch of times.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.467
He may be trying
to kill himself.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.885
He's been depressed.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.179
The dementia's getting bad.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.474
[Veronica]
Hand me that syringe.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.019
-Ugh!
-Sheesh.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.771
[Veronica]
Unresponsive to pain.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.524
-[Ian] Stroke?
-Or he's already brain-dead.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.234
That happens with overdoses.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.902
I guess it's up to us
to finish him off.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.821
Quick shot to the head,
dump his body in the lake.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.448
I don't think anybody's
gonna miss him.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.994
What? We'd just be helpin'
Mr. Fuckup finish the job.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.370
[Heidi]
You could pillow him.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.497
That's what my dad did
to my grandpa

02:44.539 --> 02:46.124
so we could sell
his double-wide.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.668
Couldn't afford
his oxygen refills anymore.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.963
-Who is that?
-Debbie's got a new friend.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.298
[Heidi]
Hey, you check his pockets,

02:53.339 --> 02:54.841
see if he got
any money on him?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.634
Trust me, he doesn't.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.973
I gotta get to work.
Is there any coffee?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.601
Yeah, I made a pot.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.019
[Carl] All right.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.898
So now what?

03:09.939 --> 03:11.524
We wait, I guess.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.818
For what?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.321
See if he dies or not.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.575
Said there's coffee?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.577
Yeah, kitchen.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.870
Let's go.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.373
Kev, we gotta get to The Alibi.
The realtor's comin' at ten.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.669
mellow rock music

04:01.532 --> 04:03.409
Hey, when are you guys
heading to Kentucky?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.370
Soon as we can sell The Alibi.
You in your new place yet?

04:05.411 --> 04:08.122
Yeah, but we still need to get
furniture and everything.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.540
We're havin' a yard sale
over the weekend.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.501
You should come by first
and get whatever you want.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.378
Yeah, thanks, that'd be great.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.506
[Mickey clears throat]

04:16.547 --> 04:18.925
Oh, yeah, everybody
should come to The Alibi later.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.093
Drinks are gonna be
half off.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.844
It's a special thank-you
to our customers

04:21.886 --> 04:23.304
for their years
of loyal alcoholism.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.848
Mm.
That sounds really great, Kev.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.725
What time do you wanna do that?

04:28.351 --> 04:29.519
Seven?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.230
-Good. We'll be there.
-[Veronica] Come on, Kevin.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.024
Let us know about Frank, okay?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.901
Franny, breakfast.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.906
So your big plans of sellin'
the house fell through, huh?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.825
Yeah, try not to look
so happy about it.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.493
It's hard not to.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.203
I don't think
I've ever been so happy

04:47.245 --> 04:49.914
to see somebody fail before.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.791
All right, I'm out.
Peace.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.585
You gonna repair
all the damages you did?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.840
[scoffs]

05:04.512 --> 05:05.638
[scoffs]

05:07.557 --> 05:08.683
[Debbie sighs]

05:08.725 --> 05:10.810
What?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.020
Pretty harsh, Debs.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.646
What? He was gonna put
Franny and me on the street.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.815
And pretty dramatic--
he was trying to give us all

05:15.857 --> 05:17.817
-a fresh start.
-I don't want a fresh start.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.861
-I love this house.
-You love this house?

05:19.902 --> 05:20.987
Yes!

05:21.029 --> 05:22.947
Easy to please, I guess.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.533
What are you doin'?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.452
I'm just gettin' shit
for the new apartment.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.453
What?

05:28.494 --> 05:31.873
Yeah. Two, uh, plates,
two bowls, two spoons.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.416
Whatever the fuck
this thing is.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.625
-What is this thing?
-That's my potato masher.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.377
-Put that back.
-[Ian] All right, Mickey--

05:36.419 --> 05:38.296
What? You must own
at least some of this shit.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.422
Yeah, we can get
our own spoons.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.299
With what money?
Spent it all on first, last,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.467
and that bullshit
security deposit.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.968
-Jesus Christ.
-[Mickey] Get a load of this.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.178
They're makin' us pay more
up front

05:45.219 --> 05:46.471
'cause we're from
the South Side.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.972
I'd get it if we were, like,
brown or Mexican or whatever,

05:48.014 --> 05:49.307
but we're as made in the USA
as any of those

05:49.349 --> 05:50.516
West Side motherfuckers,
you know what I mean?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.810
All right, come on,
put it back, let's go.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.645
I thought we were coming here
to get shit for the apartment.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.649
Yeah, clothes, my bed, sheets.
Come on, let's get the bed.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.612
I'm comin' back for that
fuckin' potato thing.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.821
[Ian] Mickey.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.824
You done?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.703
Which one are you again?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.747
Liam.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.748
[Heidi] Hmm.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.041
She your mom?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.501
Sister.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.878
No shit.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.221
[Tami]
You gonna smoke that?

06:29.889 --> 06:33.017
Want to, but, uh...nope.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.563
You okay?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.566
Yeah, fuckin' Debbie, right?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.571
That's not what I meant.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.201
No.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.203
No, I stopped caring
about Frank years ago.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.539
It's not like he ever cared
about any of us.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.836
I, um...

06:59.877 --> 07:03.840
signed up to deliver
for Zippy Zebra.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.342
Brad said he'd lend me
his Honda 400.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.345
That's good. Yeah.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.889
You gonna move in
with Fred and I?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.891
Join us at my dad's?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.436
[Lip laughs lightly]

07:19.439 --> 07:21.691
We can move back in here.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.568
Are you sure you're ready
to share a bathroom

07:23.609 --> 07:26.112
with Debbie, Franny, Liam,
and...[inhales]

07:26.154 --> 07:28.239
...whatever feral sex buddy
Debbie picks up

07:28.281 --> 07:29.907
on a freeway off-ramp?

07:30.908 --> 07:34.078
I'd survive.
[chuckles]

07:40.543 --> 07:42.462
I think I might be pregnant
again.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.923
What? How?

07:46.841 --> 07:47.842
How?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.427
I...

07:51.012 --> 07:52.763
I mean...

07:54.140 --> 07:55.600
...you're sure?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.185
Uh...no. No.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.812
I'll pick up one of those tests
on my way home from work,

07:59.854 --> 08:03.816
but...I'm late, um...

08:03.858 --> 08:07.111
and my tits are fuckin' sore
like they were with Fred.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.114
Jesus.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.951
So no, then.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.912
No what?

08:15.953 --> 08:17.914
No, you...

08:17.955 --> 08:19.999
you don't think
we should keep it.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.294
You think we should?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.005
I-I don't know.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.798
[sighs]

08:27.840 --> 08:28.758
God.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.927
It's hard enough keeping
a roof over the head

08:30.968 --> 08:32.803
of the one we got.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.933
Whoa, hey, no,
that's not on you.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.309
That's on us.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.853
This year, the virus.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.021
I know, I know.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.190
But we're still here.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.691
You know?
We're surviving.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.735
-Right?
-Yeah.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.904
Damn straight, we are.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.740
All right, listen,
I gotta get to work.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.285
But will you call me
if anything happens with Frank?

08:56.327 --> 08:58.746
-I will.
-Okay.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.915
[Tami sighs]

09:00.957 --> 09:02.500
And listen.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.877
You decide
where you want us to live.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.045
You know?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.630
I'm cool with wherever,

09:07.672 --> 09:10.424
as long as the three of us
are together.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.677
All right.

09:24.438 --> 09:28.317
rock music

09:48.879 --> 09:50.590
[door clicks open]

09:53.634 --> 09:55.928
[huffs] Your mattress
smells like ass.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.597
We can also buy a new mattress.

09:57.638 --> 10:01.017
Nah, too many good memories
stained into this one.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.185
Hey, you know
what the day is?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.895
Twentieth or 21st?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.939
Fuck should I know?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.276
[Ian] Thinkin' it's the 21st.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.278
Maybe a little less thinkin'
and open those doors.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.613
This fucker's heavy.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.493
[both grunting]

10:19.535 --> 10:20.786
After we drop this shit off,

10:20.828 --> 10:23.289
we gotta hit that furniture
rental on Ashland.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.834
They got a good deal
on taupe living room sets.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.127
All right. That it?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
No, still gotta grab
the dresser.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.506
What do we need a dresser for?
We got floors, right?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.177
[Ian] Come on.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.678
Fuck's sake.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.933
Help me run an errand later?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.101
[Debbie] Sure.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.187
Franny, you like muscle cars?

10:46.228 --> 10:48.439
Oh, yeah, American only.
Right, Fran?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.440
USA!

10:49.482 --> 10:52.151
You know, I had
a '70 Barracuda 440 once.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.195
-[Franny] Ooh!
-Mm-hmm. For a whole two hours.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.281
Smoked the cops who were on me
after I boosted it.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.786
Hey, you're your own boss,
right?

11:01.827 --> 11:03.579
Yeah.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.373
That means you don't
have to go to work

11:05.414 --> 11:07.416
if you have something
better to do.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.544
Mm...like what?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.343
Hey, Franny,
why don't you go downstairs

11:17.385 --> 11:19.970
to check if your Grandpa Frank
is dead, okay?

11:22.223 --> 11:23.891
Bye, Fran.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.145
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

11:28.187 --> 11:30.564
mellow rock music

11:30.606 --> 11:33.984
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

12:15.568 --> 12:17.695
Oh, fuck.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.658
mellow whistling

like drinking cotton candy.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.418
-Too sweet?
-Well, that depends

13:14.460 --> 13:16.337
if you're a 13-year-old girl
or not.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.713
Is there even any alcohol
in it?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.381
Not everybody wants a drink

13:19.423 --> 13:21.175
that tears the skin
off their tonsils, Tommy.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.676
I think you may need
to serve these up

-with a side of insulin.
-I gotta learn this drink menu

13:25.262 --> 13:26.347

[Veronica] The Alibi
is a South Side landmark.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.815
It's been here
since its original owner,

13:35.856 --> 13:37.566
Stan Kopchek, opened it

13:37.608 --> 13:41.362
after returning from serving
his country in World War II.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.905
His Purple Heart

13:42.947 --> 13:44.490

from the navy

are still framed
behind the bar.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.079
[Mansoor] Is there anything
you wanna specify

13:50.120 --> 13:51.455
in the listing?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.873
Exclusions, disclosures,

13:52.915 --> 13:54.500
things a buyer
would need to know?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.751
Not that I can think of.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.504
You can't change the taps.
I promised Stan we never would.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.464
And no Cubs games--ever.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.924
White Sox and Bears only.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.760
-Are you writin' this down?
-Kevin, we are selling.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.721
The new owners get to decide
which taps to use

14:07.763 --> 14:09.932
and which games
to put on the TV.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.642
Actually, I doubt very much
that a new owner

14:11.684 --> 14:14.603
is going to want to use
this space as a bar.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.897
I suspect we're looking
at a coffee shop

14:16.939 --> 14:18.983
maybe an organic food market.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.818
The apartment upstairs
could be an extra bonus

-for an escape room operator.
-[cell phone ringing]

14:22.486 --> 14:24.989

looking in the area.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.477

21:54.896 --> 21:57.399
You're in an HPD, but you're
free to knock it down.

It is not
architecturally significant.

Who's knockin' what down?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.118
That realtor,
he just said whoever buys us

22:08.160 --> 22:09.870
can tear The Alibi down.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.080
We promised Stan.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.290
Stan's dead.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.293
The worms finished that nasty
old bastard off years ago.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.627
Maybe we should
stay in Chicago.

22:17.669 --> 22:21.256
We already put the deposit down
on the condo next to Mama.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.216
Okay, then we only sell
to somebody

22:23.258 --> 22:25.010
who promises
to keep The Alibi open.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.219
I'll drink to that.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.763
We barely made enough
to keep the lights on this year

22:27.804 --> 22:31.516
with the city saying to close,
then open, then close again.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.810
You said The Alibi
was part of South Side history.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.979
I would've said
Al Capone's lost loot

22:36.021 --> 22:37.522
was buried behind a wall
in the basement

22:37.564 --> 22:40.359
if I thought that was gonna
get us an extra $20.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.028
Oh, my God!

22:43.070 --> 22:45.238
-What?
-What have you done?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.282
-Mama sent them.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.701
Take 'em off.
Take 'em off right now.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.119
-No!
-Why?

22:51.161 --> 22:53.163
-Daddy.
-What did you do?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.664
They love the jerseys.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.792
-[Kev] It's wrong, V!
-Can't do it, Veronica.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.127
I feel kind of sick.
I might throw up.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.754
The Bengals, the Reds?
What are--

23:00.796 --> 23:02.422
You-you can't just
change teams.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
That's like--
that's like-like--

23:03.924 --> 23:05.425
Switching from boxers
to briefs.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.719
Changing from Fritos
to fresh fruit.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.762
Becoming a Protestant.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.223
We're moving to Kentucky.
The Bengals play in Ohio!

23:11.264 --> 23:13.433
Well, Louisville is closer to
Cincinnati than it is Chicago.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.102
This has nothin' to do
with geography.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.020
We're a Sox and Bears
family forever.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.355
-End of discussion.
-But if--

23:18.397 --> 23:21.233
No, not one word,
or we're talkin' divorce.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.777
[Conklin] Might strip it
down to the brick

23:23.819 --> 23:25.028
instead of doing a full demo.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.947
A lot of our customers
live in lofts.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.409
They love that old
factory feel.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.994
I think we can get at least
ten tanning beds in here

23:33.036 --> 23:34.496
and a couple of spray booths,

23:34.538 --> 23:37.541
maybe even
a cryotherapy chamber.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.798
[groans]

23:44.840 --> 23:47.217
Ooh, ooh, ooh

23:54.266 --> 23:56.852
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

23:56.893 --> 23:58.186
It's funny...

23:58.228 --> 24:00.605

24:00.647 --> 24:02.232
Francis!

24:02.274 --> 24:03.900
Frank!

24:03.942 --> 24:06.194
I knock you down

24:06.236 --> 24:09.197
Brother, please...

24:09.239 --> 24:11.283
[Liam] Frank!

24:13.285 --> 24:15.787
Under the rock...

24:15.829 --> 24:18.915
Frank, I've been looking
for you.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.292
Frank!

24:20.834 --> 24:21.918
Frank!

24:24.713 --> 24:26.381
Oh, sorry.

[echoing]

24:57.871 --> 24:59.498
Wow.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.709
Lookin' purdy good up there.

[bright music playing on organ]

25:12.010 --> 25:13.929
[laughs]

25:16.848 --> 25:19.643
Oh, shit!
Uh, uh, I gotta go.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.311
I'm late.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.397
Father's gonna be mad.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.654
Oh, uh...I'm sorry.
Who are you?

25:30.695 --> 25:31.780
I'm late.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.824
I have to get the candles lit
before the procession.

25:34.866 --> 25:38.370
Uh...I'll go get Father.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.790
[organ music continues]

25:53.843 --> 25:55.136
Can I...help you?

25:55.178 --> 25:57.180
I'm sorry I'm late, Father.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.682
I can't find the matches!

25:58.723 --> 26:01.017
They were--they were--
they were always here.

26:01.059 --> 26:04.938
Oh, uh, w-we keep them
here now.

26:11.486 --> 26:14.364
Light the altar candles first.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.865
Hmm?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.869
Thank you, Father.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.835
Should I call the police?

26:26.876 --> 26:28.378
No, no.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.047
Call an ambulance.

26:31.089 --> 26:35.176
energetic music

26:35.218 --> 26:37.470
Ba, ba-da,

Hey, got your delivery.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.609
[man] Boba's here!

26:50.650 --> 26:51.985
Hang on.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.196

26:58.533 --> 27:00.869
Let me get you a tip.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.050
[buzzer blares]

27:17.761 --> 27:20.764

-[siren chirps]
-[Carl] Jeez.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.947
Hey. Got you a Jim's
with extra onions.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.365
Thanks.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.991
How's it going
soaking the rich?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.119
Great. I've given out
six grand in tickets,

28:24.160 --> 28:25.370
and it's only two o'clock.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.415
Minding the handicap spot
gold mine, I see--smart.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.709

28:34.838 --> 28:38.091
Yeah, American meritocracy's
bullshit.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.342
World distributes talent
equally

28:39.384 --> 28:40.593
but not opportunity.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.470
Look at you,
up on the ramparts.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.889
-Where'd you hear that?
-Some lady left Obama's book

28:44.931 --> 28:47.392
at the bus stop.
Guy's actually kind of smart.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.728
Carl is a cautionary tale.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.731
Never allow injustice to get
in the way of your paycheck.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.232
Bosses
won't leave you here long.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.693
Too many officers
taking pandemic disability.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
Hey, can you run somebody
for me?

28:58.987 --> 29:01.865
-Yeah, you got a name?
-Uh, Heidi somethin'.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.324
Uh...

29:03.366 --> 29:04.993
Heidi Cronch.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.537
C-R-O-N-C-H.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.496
New girlfriend?

29:08.538 --> 29:10.874
My sister's new girlfriend.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.712
-Holy shit. That her?
-Yeah.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.130
Might wanna lock up
the silver

29:17.172 --> 29:18.298
and hide the women
in the woods.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.632
[dispatcher]
All available units...

29:19.674 --> 29:20.925
Oh, gotta go.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.552
Hey, buy you a beer
after work?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.637
I'm doing a family thing
at a friend of mine's bar.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.347
-Half-price drinks.
-I don't know.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.557
I been steering clear
of the cocktails

29:27.599 --> 29:30.059
-with the old ticker.
-Order something virgin.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.269
Maybe.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.903
[man]
yelling in foreign language

29:39.944 --> 29:41.154
Huh?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.205
[Heidi] Let's go.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.165
-Who is that guy?
-A friend.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.333
Uh, come on.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.960
He seems a little pissed.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.630
Well, he wanted a Mercedes,
but he'll live.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.342
Okay, it's definitely
time to go now.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.593
Let's go.
Go, go, go!

30:03.635 --> 30:05.261
You're a loser, Anton!

[gun cocks, fires]

punchy music

30:09.599 --> 30:11.935
The last idea I had

30:11.976 --> 30:16.231
Got swallowed
by a black hole

30:18.733 --> 30:20.777
I could cure cancer

30:20.819 --> 30:24.322
But they'd give the prize
to some asshole

30:27.575 --> 30:31.663
Wastin' time,
everybody's ending mine

30:31.704 --> 30:33.832
Yeah, you could've
done it fast

30:33.873 --> 30:37.377
But the fit
just wasn't right

30:37.418 --> 30:38.753
[doorbell rings]

30:38.795 --> 30:40.338
[Stephen]  Keep saying that like
it's supposed to do something.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.548
I don't know
what you want me to do.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.341
I've tried all that.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.635
Yes, I did all of that.
What?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.221
Voodoo Thai?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.848
Yes, I did!

30:51.099 --> 30:53.268
Yes, of course
I fucking back-tested.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.727
I'm not stupid.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.021
I don't know, it's just--
it's--

30:57.063 --> 30:58.898
it's just--it's fucking frozen.
I don't know.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.735
I got four minutes
to execute this trade, dude.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.446
I--you installed the algorithm.
You tell me!

31:05.488 --> 31:06.823
Check the router?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.158
That's your fucking solution,
check the router?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.327
Gotta be kidding me.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.664
This is ridiculous.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.666
This has happened to me I--

31:16.708 --> 31:19.669
fucking ten times before
in the past with you guys.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.045
I'm sick of it.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.589
Yeah, I'm standing
at the router right now.

31:22.630 --> 31:26.342
Just-just calm down
for five seconds.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.720
I don't know--
[scoffs]

31:28.761 --> 31:30.763
Dude, I don't know
what you want me to do!

31:30.805 --> 31:32.473
The router looks fine.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.684
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

31:34.726 --> 31:36.436
The hell away from there.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.356
Wait, what did you just do?

31:40.398 --> 31:42.317
Your Forex rate speed
algorithm

31:42.358 --> 31:44.569
was set to LSF instead of LSE.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.072
You're trying to trade
in pounds sterling, right?

31:48.114 --> 31:49.908
Yeah, i-it didn't know
what exchange rate

31:49.949 --> 31:51.200
you were trying to use.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.916
Oh, my God, it went through.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.794
It wen--I just made
four fucking grand.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.339
[laughs]

32:04.380 --> 32:06.299
I just made four fucking grand!

32:06.341 --> 32:08.384
[laughing] Holy shit!

32:08.426 --> 32:09.761
Here's your pad thai.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.679
That's--yeah, great.
Right there.

[camera shutter clicks]

32:13.348 --> 32:15.683
Oh, tip, um...

32:15.725 --> 32:18.102
what have we got, 20 bucks?

32:18.144 --> 32:21.272
[laughing] Shit, man.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.234
It's ten percent, right?

32:27.362 --> 32:29.072

mellow rock music

32:44.379 --> 32:46.297
Yeah

32:54.097 --> 32:58.184
Maybe we can go
to a quiet place

32:58.226 --> 33:02.230
Where the only sound
I hear is just your voice

33:02.271 --> 33:06.567
Screaming my face,
but I can understand

33:14.450 --> 33:16.327
[siren whoops]

33:28.673 --> 33:32.135
[Father] Francis,
we're gonna be at the hospital

33:32.176 --> 33:34.178
very soon, okay?

33:35.972 --> 33:38.307
Offer's comin' in.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.226
How much?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.311
Earnest money, 5,000.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.398
That's good.
Sixty-day escrow.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.816
What the hell is escrow?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.693
They hold the money to make
sure the deal goes through.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.737
We don't need that.
We can hold the money.

33:50.778 --> 33:51.904
I love holdin' money.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.323
-Is this the tanning bed guy?
-I think so, yeah.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.242
Aw, damn.
I don't tan well.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.077
-How much?
-Hang on.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.620
How much?

33:59.662 --> 34:01.664
Two hundred and eighty-five.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.332
That's good, right?

34:03.374 --> 34:04.959
We owe the bank 250.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.252
That's bad, right?

34:06.294 --> 34:08.963
We'd clear 35,000,
owe some money in taxes,

34:09.005 --> 34:11.507
-so maybe 30?
-Is that good enough?

34:11.549 --> 34:12.800
I was hopin' for more.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.094
All right, fuck it.
Let's not sell, then.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.221
It's 30 more than we have now.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.681
We could wait
for another offer.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.641
-All right, let's do that.
-[Veronica] But a better offer

34:20.683 --> 34:23.686
may not ever come
or even another offer.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.688
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Oh, I hate that game.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.024
-I always lose.
-You always pick scissors.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.734
-You always pick rock.
-Exactly.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.611
-That's why you always lose.
-What?

34:31.652 --> 34:32.862
So I should pick paper
next time?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.989
Would you two shut the fuck up?
I'm trying to think.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.157
[door clicks open]

34:36.199 --> 34:38.159
[sighs] Has Frank
been here today?

34:38.201 --> 34:40.036
-Dead Frank?
-Not-so-dead Frank.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.829
-He disappeared.
-[Kev] No kidding?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.456
That's great news!
I been racking my brain

34:43.498 --> 34:45.374
trying to come up with
somethin' nice to say about him

34:45.416 --> 34:46.626
at the wake.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.044
Uh, he could always
be counted on

34:48.086 --> 34:50.505
to drain your beer when
you weren't payin' attention?

34:50.546 --> 34:52.090
[sighs] So no one's seen him.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.925
Sorry, Liam.
But he's still breathin'.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.427
-That's good, huh?
-Good for who?

34:59.806 --> 35:00.932
If he does show up,

35:00.973 --> 35:03.226
can you make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

35:03.267 --> 35:04.769
Sure. Of course.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.397
[rock music playing
over speakers]

35:13.152 --> 35:15.571
All right,
are we sellin' or not?

35:17.490 --> 35:21.160
[indistinct chatter]

35:23.579 --> 35:24.997
BP 135 over 85,

35:25.039 --> 35:28.042
pulse ox is 94 on RA,
so we kept him off O2.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.169
Altered and confused.
He could be high.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.339
There's no ID on him, but we
think his name is Francis.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.716
Hi, Francis.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.510
You know where you are?

35:37.552 --> 35:38.886
You're in the emergency room.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.722
We're gonna take care of you,
okay?

35:41.764 --> 35:42.932
[Frank] I don't feel very good.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.601
Right. We're gonna check
you out soon as we can.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.280
They keep a key under a rock
in the yard?

35:57.321 --> 35:59.323
I'd have known that, I would've
cleaned them out years ago.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.784
All right, V said everything
in the living room

36:01.826 --> 36:03.786
and on the dining room table's
up for grabs.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.246
A lot of good kitchen stuff
we could use.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.916
We got a mixing bowl, some
pots and pans, cutting board.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.334
What, you gonna start
cookin' now?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.920
One of us has to.
Takeout's too expensive.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.464
Hey, man, ramen, some water,
and a minute in the microwave,

36:15.506 --> 36:16.799
I'm all set.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.925
Hoo!

36:17.967 --> 36:19.719
Look at this, leather chaps.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.470
What do you think, huh?
Dress up in leather,

36:21.512 --> 36:24.182
go cruising for some flabby
dentist dudes we can roll?

36:24.223 --> 36:27.018
-[snickers]
-Hey.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.228
Take a look at this crib.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.232
It's in pretty good shape.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.984
What do you mean, "Come
take a look at this crib"?

36:35.026 --> 36:37.320
Crib means baby.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.405
[Ian] Yeah.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.449
"Yeah," what?

36:41.490 --> 36:43.201
What, you wanna have a baby?

36:44.410 --> 36:45.578
You don't want a baby?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.330
W--h-hold on.
You do?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.665
Hell yes.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.876
All right, man, well,
I don't know if you've noticed,

36:51.918 --> 36:53.878
we don't exactly have
the right equipment.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
Although the way you been
talkin' about pans

36:55.338 --> 36:58.090
and fuckin' taupe furniture,
you might be growin' a vagina.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.551
Help me move this thing.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.012
No.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.388
Why not?

37:04.430 --> 37:05.598
'Cause if we have a crib,

37:05.640 --> 37:07.516
we gotta fuckin'
put somethin' in it.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.143
Just grab the other end.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.354
Where are we even gonna
get a baby, huh?

37:11.395 --> 37:14.023
No one's gonna let two ex-cons
adopt a kid.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.858
So we'll steal one.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.360
What?

37:17.401 --> 37:18.277
I'm joking.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.446
Look, there's gotta be
a neglected Milkovich baby

37:20.488 --> 37:22.198
crawling around
your family tree somewhere.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.116
You guys are like
horny little rabbits.

37:24.158 --> 37:27.119
You pop out a Milkovich fucker
at least once a month.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.539
What?

37:31.999 --> 37:34.377
I'd be a shitty dad, man.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.212
No, you wouldn't.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.131
Yeah, what if I, like...

37:39.173 --> 37:40.466
beat it or...

37:40.508 --> 37:41.926
You won't.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.136
[huffs]
Spare the fireplace poker,

37:44.178 --> 37:45.221
spoil the child.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.556
That's the kind of shit
my dad always said.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.143
Come here.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.020
-Fuck you.
-Come on.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.897
Fuck off. No, I don't--

37:54.939 --> 37:56.565
Fu--

37:58.859 --> 38:00.528
[Mickey] I hate this.

38:00.569 --> 38:03.447
You're gonna be a great dad.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.048
Hey.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.259
Couldn't find him.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.053
I'm not surprised.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.515
-I never could either.
-You used to look for Frank?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.600
Yeah.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.185
All the time.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.939
Did he always come back?

38:37.857 --> 38:39.525
Not right away.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.319
But yeah.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.324
Hey, why don't you
go get dressed?

38:46.365 --> 38:48.451
Get ready for that thing
at The Alibi, all right?

38:48.492 --> 38:49.785
Okay.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.297
Yo!

39:01.339 --> 39:04.175
Shelby.
What's goin' on, man?

39:04.216 --> 39:05.301
Shit, man.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.054
Checkin' out this vacant lot.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.805
Oh, yeah? How come?

39:09.847 --> 39:11.640
Thinkin' of buyin' it.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.726
Oh, shit.
What for?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.061
Neighborhood's comin' up, man.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.937
With that condo project
goin' in next to you,

39:16.979 --> 39:18.773
I figured it'd be
a good place

39:18.814 --> 39:21.150
to put my settlement money.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.318
You got a settlement?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.029
That gas leak
that took my mom.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.489
That was, like,
ten years ago.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.033
Yeah.
Legal shit takes forever.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.786
I heard your house
was a part of that condo deal.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.454
Surprised you didn't sell.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.748
Yeah, me too.
Got screwed.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.875
You were gonna sell?

39:37.917 --> 39:39.335
Yeah.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.671
How much were you thinkin'
of selling your house for?

39:44.673 --> 39:46.926
I don't know.
I was thinkin', like, 200.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.928
[laughs] Oh, well, yeah.

39:48.969 --> 39:51.013
That's a bit outta
my price range.

39:51.055 --> 39:55.684
I mean...we're prepared
to go as low as 150.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.937
Good to see you, Lip.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.855
Take care.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.401
Hey, Shelby.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.531
How much you got, man?

40:09.824 --> 40:10.908
[Debbie moaning]

40:10.950 --> 40:12.910
- Don't touch me like that
-[Debbie]  Oh, my God.

40:12.952 --> 40:17.957
Get mad when I fall in love
too fast, too bad...

40:17.998 --> 40:20.668
Oh, my God.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.631
Do you want me to for you?

40:25.673 --> 40:27.007
No, no, I'm good.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.552
Maybe we'll go
a couple more rounds later.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.889
Hey, I'm thinking
of splitting tomorrow.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.100
Why?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.352
El Paso--got a couple friends
in a club down there

40:38.394 --> 40:41.355
running some shit
that sounds promising.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.399
You're more than welcome
to come.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.735
-To Texas?
-Yeah, get outta Chicago

40:46.777 --> 40:47.987
before it gets cold.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.655
You got your tools,
your truck,

40:49.697 --> 40:51.991
and you can fix pipes
and whatever,

40:52.032 --> 40:54.201
and I'll do my thing.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.120
What about Franny?

40:56.162 --> 40:57.913
Oh, well, bring her.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.498
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.959
Why the hell not?
We can have some laughs.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.294
Thelma and Louise it.

41:03.335 --> 41:06.338
You only live once, right?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.304
Hey, Franny,
what you doin'?

41:13.345 --> 41:16.348
-Drawing.
-Oh, yeah?

41:17.683 --> 41:19.477
Uh, it's lookin' good.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.276
mellow music

41:56.180 --> 41:59.517
[indistinct chatter]

42:01.894 --> 42:03.062
Fiona?

42:04.021 --> 42:05.147
Hi.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.024
Where have you been?

42:07.066 --> 42:08.442
I've been right here.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.028
-Yeah?
-Course.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.906
How are you feeling,
Francis?

42:13.948 --> 42:15.449
-Frank.
-Sorry.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.368
How are you feeling, Frank?

42:17.409 --> 42:20.079
You're so beautiful.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.914
Thank you.

42:25.084 --> 42:27.920
[thermometer beeping]

42:27.962 --> 42:29.880
-Nancy?
-[Nancy] Yep.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.257
[Sophia]
Did rapid come back yet?

42:31.298 --> 42:34.260
[Nancy] Uh, yes...
and it is negative.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.262
[Sophia] Temp's spiking, 103.4

42:36.303 --> 42:37.596
And his pulse ox is 88.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.306
Lung sounds diminished
bilaterally.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.766
I think we should run a PCR.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.851
[Nancy] Okay.
Uh, draw a CBC with diff.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.271
Start him on ten of O2
with a non-rebreather

42:45.312 --> 42:47.565
and get him into a gown,
please.

42:51.318 --> 42:55.698
Fiona, you cried a lot
as a baby.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.368
Mad all the time.

42:59.410 --> 43:03.038
Okay. Just take deep breaths.
Try not to talk.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.750
But so beautiful.

43:06.792 --> 43:08.043
[chuckles]

43:43.662 --> 43:45.748
[Kev] Oh, shit!
It's Officer Carl.

43:45.789 --> 43:48.375
Hide your drugs
and illegal firearms.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.501
I'm off duty, Kev.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.253
And this is my comrade in blue,
Arthur Tipping.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.380
He's helping me chase
the gentrifiers

43:53.422 --> 43:55.174
and scumbag developers
off the streets

43:55.215 --> 43:56.592
of our beloved South Side.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.427
Pleasure. Making sure no one
shoots this idiot?

43:58.469 --> 44:00.596
Doing what I can.
But he's an animal out there.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.181
-I know.
-[Veronica] The dancers

44:02.222 --> 44:03.807
are gonna put their costumes on
upstairs.

44:03.849 --> 44:06.268
What can I get you two
underpaid public servants?

44:06.310 --> 44:07.311
I will be having a beer,

44:07.353 --> 44:09.355
and Arthur here will order
something virgin.

44:09.396 --> 44:10.731
Well, you came
to the right place.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.733
-You like your drinks pink?
-Or bright blue?

44:12.775 --> 44:14.318
How 'bout a Coke?

44:14.360 --> 44:16.278
Well, this place is great.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.571
Enjoy it while it lasts.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.239
It's gonna be a tanning salon
in a couple weeks.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.532
Wait, you guys already sell?

44:20.574 --> 44:23.077
We got an offer.
Came in kind of low.

44:23.118 --> 44:24.536
We have a couple of days
to decide

44:24.578 --> 44:26.372
-if we're gonna accept it.
-Shame.

44:26.413 --> 44:28.374
There aren't a lot of places
like this around anymore.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.584
You mean money-losing
businesses?

44:30.626 --> 44:33.545
Great dive bars where
your shoes stick to the floor

44:33.587 --> 44:35.172
and you're not elbowed
away from the bar

44:35.214 --> 44:36.799
by dudes with man buns.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.050
Amen.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.344
Hey. They here yet?

44:40.386 --> 44:41.720
No, not yet.
You got the sign?

44:41.762 --> 44:42.971
Yeah. Should I put it
in the back?

44:43.013 --> 44:44.556
-Yeah.
-Cool.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.351
Jesus, there she is.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.311
-The other one your sister?
-[Carl] Yeah.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.271
-You gonna tell her?
-Eh. I don't know.

44:51.313 --> 44:53.148
[Arthur] I'd wait till
that Heidi's not around.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.317
She's likely to cut you.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.361
[Lip] Hey, I've got
the sausages and the buns.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.904
-Where you want 'em?
-Uh, put 'em in the back.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.030
[Lip] All right.

45:05.786 --> 45:07.579
No Frank?

45:08.831 --> 45:12.126
[rock music playing
over speakers]

45:20.467 --> 45:24.221
[Nancy]
PCR came back positive.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.098
Pulse ox is down to 84.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.475
Respiration's 30.
Get his bed up.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.520
Uh, we need respiratory
back down here.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.522
Nancy?

45:33.564 --> 45:34.898
[Nancy]
Yep.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.235
[Nancy] Wow.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.320
[Sophia]
Is that legally binding?

45:40.362 --> 45:41.947
Claire?

45:44.616 --> 45:46.368
[Claire]
Huh. That's new.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.619
-COVID?
-Yeah.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.204
Start him on comfort care,

45:49.246 --> 45:51.331
0.6 milligrams
hydromorphone IV.

45:51.373 --> 45:52.624
I'll call legal.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.543
Is that Frank?

45:54.585 --> 45:55.627
[Sophia] Yeah, he said
that was his name,

45:55.669 --> 45:57.212
but he came in without any ID.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.256
Gallagher. Frank Gallagher.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.507
[Sophia] You know him?

46:00.549 --> 46:02.050
[Nancy] He's a frequent-flier
legend.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.802
[Claire] I think he may
still be number one

46:03.844 --> 46:06.054
on our drug-seeking
no-fly list.

46:06.096 --> 46:06.930
Call for his chart.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.766
There'll be some contact
information on there.

46:08.807 --> 46:10.726
[Nancy]
Mm-hmm.

46:14.396 --> 46:17.191
soft ethereal music

46:20.444 --> 46:24.364
[no audible dialogue]

46:38.629 --> 46:40.255
Hey, I don't wanna
stay too long, all right?

46:40.297 --> 46:41.381
I wanna get back
to the apartment

46:41.423 --> 46:42.591
so I can unpack my clothes.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.301
Yeah, four or five beers,
and we'll go.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.011
One beer, and we'll go.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.554
[laughing] Fine.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.890
Do you seriously
not know what today is?

46:49.932 --> 46:53.393
Jesus Chr--
I don't know. Thursday?

46:53.435 --> 46:55.771
Twenty-first.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.898
Doesn't ring any bells
with you?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.274
No. Should it?

46:59.316 --> 47:01.819
It's our wedding anniversary.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.987
Oh!

47:04.988 --> 47:06.198
Oh, shit.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.951
One year ago today.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.078
Hey, man.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.205
That's great.

47:16.708 --> 47:18.836
Come on.
I'm thirsty.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.718
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

47:26.760 --> 47:29.346
[people]
Happy anniversary!

47:29.388 --> 47:31.139
[shouting]

47:31.181 --> 47:35.435
[cheers and applause]

47:35.477 --> 47:36.603
[Lip] Speech!

47:36.645 --> 47:39.147
[all] Speech!

47:40.691 --> 47:42.359
Um...

47:46.154 --> 47:47.489
I love this man.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.491
[cheers and applause]

47:49.533 --> 47:52.578
[romantic accordion music
playing]

48:04.464 --> 48:07.426
[indistinct chatter]

48:07.467 --> 48:08.635
[man 1] Who wants to dance?

48:08.677 --> 48:10.888
[man 2] We'll see.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.520
How you doing in there, Frank?

48:18.562 --> 48:20.022
[Frank moans, mutters]

48:20.063 --> 48:22.357
What's that?

48:22.399 --> 48:25.193
[sighs]
Frank Gallagher's files.

48:25.235 --> 48:26.236
Come on.

48:26.278 --> 48:30.198
Help me find an emergency
contact number in this mess.

48:40.208 --> 48:43.712
[soft whooshing]

48:43.754 --> 48:47.424
[Frank breathing deeply]

49:12.449 --> 49:15.452
[no audible dialogue]

49:19.790 --> 49:23.627
[dance music playing]

49:23.669 --> 49:26.505
You can't let them
sell this place.

49:26.546 --> 49:27.965
I know. I'm gonna miss it.

49:28.006 --> 49:31.510
-It'd make a great cop bar.
-You know what? It would.

49:31.551 --> 49:33.220
I got my 20 in,
some money stashed away.

49:33.261 --> 49:35.889
We could partner up.
You'd look good behind the bar.

49:35.931 --> 49:37.975
-No money.
-How much they selling for?

49:38.016 --> 49:42.437
I don't know.
Hey, Kev. Come here.

49:44.564 --> 49:46.233
-You made it.
-Yeah.

49:46.274 --> 49:47.401
[Lip] One year.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.069
You had doubts?

49:49.111 --> 49:52.114
Yeah, you didn't?

49:55.575 --> 49:58.161
[Lip]
Tami may be pregnant again.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.373
Congratulations.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.501
It's not good news.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.212
It's been a tough year.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.631
Ah, so what?

50:09.673 --> 50:11.550
Do it anyway.

50:11.591 --> 50:12.634
Hey, you don't want it,

50:12.676 --> 50:14.636
Mickey and I can take it
off your hands.

50:14.678 --> 50:16.138
Yeah, you want kids?

50:16.179 --> 50:20.058
I do.
Mickey, um...not so much.

50:21.852 --> 50:24.730
Hey, I think I found somebody
who might wanna buy the house.

50:24.771 --> 50:27.441
-No shit?
-Mm-hmm. Shelby.

50:27.482 --> 50:29.526
The barbecue guy?

50:29.568 --> 50:32.404
-Mm-hmm.
-How much?

50:32.446 --> 50:34.531
He's only got 75 grand.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.158
Ouch.

50:36.199 --> 50:38.076
Kev and V got 175?

50:38.118 --> 50:40.370
Yeah.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.706
So that means we get, uh,

50:42.748 --> 50:45.000
15 each?

50:45.042 --> 50:46.668
Oh, it's not much, but...

50:46.710 --> 50:48.503
it's something.

50:50.714 --> 50:52.174
You take my 15.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.676
We don't need it.
We're doin' fine.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.014
Thank you.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.349
But no, thanks.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.105
So...should we sell?

51:08.356 --> 51:10.150
You decide.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.277
I'm good with whatever
you wanna do.

51:12.319 --> 51:16.448
Everybody's leaving me
with the decisions today.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.159
That's 'cause you're
the closest thing to a dad

51:19.201 --> 51:20.452
we ever had.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.540
Yeah?

51:33.381 --> 51:34.424
[Lip] Better go get Mickey

51:34.466 --> 51:36.843
before he runs off
with one of those dancers.

51:41.807 --> 51:44.059
Love you, big brother.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.604
Yeah, I love you too, asshole.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.304
[muffled chatter
and music playing]

53:21.114 --> 53:24.242
[Josh] Hey, there's a car
on fire out here!

53:24.284 --> 53:25.994
-Come on, check it out!
-Hey, grab your drink.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.079
-Oh, this, I gotta see.
-Come on. Hey, let's go.

53:28.121 --> 53:29.623
[Veronica] All right,
make sure you pay our tabs

53:29.664 --> 53:31.541
before you walk out the door.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.001
I will find y'all.

53:33.043 --> 53:36.838
[indistinct chatter]

53:54.940 --> 53:57.734
[man] I've been
on the phone for 20 minutes!

53:57.776 --> 53:59.861
My car is burn--
it's a white Tesla.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.530
It's in the middle
of the street--it's on fire!

54:02.572 --> 54:03.990
Hey, how you like

54:04.032 --> 54:07.786
that $80,000 Roman candle
now, bitch?

54:07.827 --> 54:10.580
[laughter]

54:11.039 --> 54:13.541
We get high
in backseats of cars

54:13.583 --> 54:17.045
We break
into mobile homes

54:17.087 --> 54:20.715
We go to sleep
to Shake Appeal

54:20.757 --> 54:23.718
Never wake up on our own

54:23.760 --> 54:25.845
That's the way we get by

54:25.887 --> 54:27.973
To the way we get by

54:28.014 --> 54:30.642
Oh, that's the way
we get by

54:30.684 --> 54:32.477
To the way we get by

54:32.519 --> 54:35.021
[muffled]
Oh, that's the way

54:35.063 --> 54:38.233
We get by,
to the way we get by

54:38.275 --> 54:40.485
That's the way we get by

54:40.527 --> 54:43.863
The way we get by,
the way we get by

54:43.905 --> 54:46.741
[singing fades]

55:26.781 --> 55:29.034
To the way we get by

55:29.075 --> 55:31.369
Oh, that's the way
we get by

55:31.411 --> 55:34.247
To the way we get by

55:34.289 --> 55:36.708
That's the way
we get by

55:36.750 --> 55:38.543
To the way we get by

55:38.585 --> 55:42.339
[singing fades]
That's the way we get by

55:43.256 --> 55:45.008
[Frank]  I'm not gonna ask
your forgiveness,

55:45.050 --> 55:47.135
because you bunch
didn't do shit for me.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.346
So let's just call it a draw.

55:49.387 --> 55:53.016
I know some of you think
you hate my guts,

55:53.058 --> 55:54.434
and truth be told,

55:54.476 --> 55:56.895
I never liked any of you
much either.

55:56.936 --> 55:59.814
But we're all Gallaghers.

55:59.856 --> 56:01.441
My only advice

56:01.483 --> 56:05.111
is to stop worrying
so damn much.

56:05.153 --> 56:08.114
You're supposed to ask people
on their deathbed

56:08.156 --> 56:10.241
if they wish
they'd worked more

56:10.283 --> 56:12.994
or spent more time
with their family.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.788
[chuckles]  Me?

56:14.829 --> 56:17.207
Hell, I wish I'd partied more.

56:17.248 --> 56:19.084
Nobody ever said
our neighborhood

56:19.125 --> 56:20.377
was the Garden of Eden,

56:20.418 --> 56:22.712
but it's been a good home
to us,

56:22.754 --> 56:24.381
to me and you kids.

56:24.422 --> 56:26.508
I'm proud of all of you,

56:26.549 --> 56:28.051
because every single
one of you

56:28.093 --> 56:30.804
reminds me a little bit of me.

56:30.845 --> 56:32.347
Lip, you're smart as a whip.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.975
You just can't seem
to get outta your own way.

56:36.017 --> 56:38.978
Eh, you'll figure it out.

56:39.020 --> 56:43.316
Ian--industrious,
incredible work ethic.

56:43.358 --> 56:47.237
Not a clue
where you got that from.

56:47.278 --> 56:49.364
Touch of mental illness
from your mother.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.865
Only way I can understand

56:50.907 --> 56:53.785
how you ended up
marrying a Milkovich.

56:53.827 --> 56:55.203
Carl...ha.

56:55.245 --> 56:58.415
I never could figure you out.

56:58.456 --> 57:02.377
Can't believe you betrayed
the family and became a cop.

57:02.419 --> 57:06.381
I'm hoping
you're already on the take.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.592
Debbie,
you remind me of your mother,

57:09.634 --> 57:11.094
not in a good way.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.347
Good luck in life.
You're gonna need it.

57:14.389 --> 57:17.183
Liam, you're the apple
of my eye.

57:17.225 --> 57:19.102
You handsome devil.

57:19.144 --> 57:23.064
Everybody says
you look just like me.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.733
Oh, Kev, Veronica,

57:25.775 --> 57:27.193
you're overrated as friends.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.863
Always sticking your noses
in my family's business

57:29.904 --> 57:31.239
where they don't belong.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.741
You're moving.
I say good riddance.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.122
And me, Frank Gallagher--

57:39.164 --> 57:42.208
father, teacher, mentor.

57:42.250 --> 57:44.836
Captain of our little ship.

57:44.878 --> 57:48.256
People say you can't drink
your troubles away.

57:48.298 --> 57:52.969
I say you're just not
drinkin' enough.

57:53.011 --> 57:56.264
Ah...I guess that's it.

57:56.306 --> 58:00.059
Not much left to say, really.

58:00.101 --> 58:03.480
Except...time's precious.

58:03.521 --> 58:05.648
Don't fuckin' waste it.

58:05.690 --> 58:09.527
Have a good time.
I sure as hell did.

58:09.569 --> 58:11.404
That's the way we get by

58:11.446 --> 58:14.157
To way we get by,
to way

58:14.199 --> 58:17.285
That's the way we get by

58:17.327 --> 58:20.038
That's the way
we get by

58:21.831 --> 58:25.043
[Georgio] Damn! What is
this guy, like, 80 proof?

58:25.084 --> 58:26.628
[Marco] At least.
This guy definitely liked

58:26.669 --> 58:29.255
-to knock back a couple.
-[Georgio] Couple of cases

58:29.297 --> 58:31.216
and two bottles of JB's
more like it.

58:31.257 --> 58:33.801
[both chuckle]

58:43.061 --> 58:45.396
[metal creaking, moaning]

58:48.525 --> 58:51.986
[both moaning, coughing]

58:53.947 --> 58:57.367
[item clattering]

59:06.084 --> 59:07.293
Oh

59:07.335 --> 59:10.338
rock music

59:14.926 --> 59:17.136
Ah, trouble come runnin'

59:17.178 --> 59:19.347
Here it come runnin' again

59:21.307 --> 59:24.102
Well, all right

59:24.143 --> 59:27.522
I got taken away

59:27.564 --> 59:31.109
By a heavenly host

59:31.150 --> 59:33.861
To a heavenly place

59:33.903 --> 59:44.666
Ah, running again
