WEBVTT

01:21.981 --> 01:23.191
What are you doing here?

01:27.070 --> 01:30.281
A mother-and-daughter
girl scout team selling cookies...

01:30.281 --> 01:32.784
found the door open,
saw the blood and called 911.

01:32.784 --> 01:34.660
Got to be a badge for that, right?

01:36.204 --> 01:37.997
There's no I.D.

01:37.997 --> 01:41.667
We're running the car outside,
and the homeowner's information.

01:43.836 --> 01:47.548
No sign of struggle or
disturbance, is there?

01:48.591 --> 01:51.052
It's the same way in
the bedroom ...

01:51.052 --> 01:54.180
only it's more disturbing.

02:08.443 --> 02:09.737
Check this.

02:09.737 --> 02:11.697
Got to be a hundred
grand in watches.

02:11.697 --> 02:14.951
$100,000 in watches,
untouched.

02:14.951 --> 02:17.537
I guess we can rule out robbery.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.747
Vic had to know the killer.

02:19.747 --> 02:23.918
Had my guys check the perimeter.
No signs of forced entry.

02:24.335 --> 02:25.378
Oh ...

02:26.337 --> 02:28.423
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

03:05.126 --> 03:08.045
1x14 Forced Entry

03:14.467 --> 03:17.636
Set of expensive clothes,
meticulously laid out,

03:17.636 --> 03:18.888
possibly for a date.

03:20.347 --> 03:23.517
Maybe the doorbell rang and his
date had a little surprise for him.

03:23.517 --> 03:26.729
Which left our vic
with severe anal trauma...

03:26.729 --> 03:29.440
and lacerations in the distal
portion of the rectum.

03:29.523 --> 03:30.983
Do we have a time of death?

03:30.983 --> 03:33.110
Liver temp was 88.2,

03:33.110 --> 03:35.654
so he took his last breath
about twelve hours ago.

03:35.654 --> 03:39.241
That would be 11:00 last night.
Okay, Speed ...

03:39.450 --> 03:41.243
I got about four or five hairs here.

03:41.869 --> 03:43.662
Let's test the sheets for semen.

03:43.746 --> 03:45.831
I've got something
on this head wound.

03:45.831 --> 03:47.917
Doesn't look like blood.
It's metallic.

03:53.214 --> 03:57.468
Porsche in the driveway registered
to a Richard Lee Hauschild.

03:57.468 --> 03:59.845
The house is listed
under Devereaux Jones.

03:59.845 --> 04:03.140
And this watch is engraved
to a Mr. Zack Kelsey.

04:03.140 --> 04:05.267
So who the hell
is this poor guy?

04:05.267 --> 04:08.395
That is a very good
question, isn't it?

04:14.944 --> 04:16.570
Welcome to the crematorium.

04:16.570 --> 04:17.947
Thanks, Detective.

04:18.781 --> 04:19.824
Watch your step.

04:28.874 --> 04:30.334
One beaten body.

04:33.003 --> 04:35.798
One or more burned bodies
in the crematorium chamber.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.053
What in the world went on here?

04:42.221 --> 04:43.973
Benito Ramon owned
the crematorium.

04:44.181 --> 04:47.393
A funeral director dropping off
one of his customers called it in.

04:48.352 --> 04:51.564
Looks like Benito had a side gig
going on with the gold fillings.

04:55.276 --> 04:56.110
You check the purse?

04:56.110 --> 04:58.446
Yeah. I.D. inside
said "Michelle Carter."

04:58.446 --> 05:02.199
No cash, just some makeup,
breath mints, and a dried-out rose.

05:03.743 --> 05:05.411
You better come
take a look outside.

05:27.975 --> 05:30.644
Benito must've been
dumping the bodies out here...

05:30.644 --> 05:31.896
instead of cremating them.

05:32.104 --> 05:33.189
It's like Atlanta;

05:33.189 --> 05:35.399
there were over three
hundred bodies in that one.

05:36.525 --> 05:38.444
We can I.D.
them with toe tags,

05:38.444 --> 05:40.946
or ankle bracelets
from the funeral home.

05:41.072 --> 05:43.240
The Medical Examiner will
probably take the lead,

05:43.240 --> 05:45.951
so we'll roll out backup.
We stay on homicide.

05:46.535 --> 05:49.538
Bedroom boy has broken
blood vessels in both eyes.

05:49.538 --> 05:51.290
Signs of petechiael
hemorrhages.

05:51.290 --> 05:52.500
Cause of death?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.001
Suffocation.

05:54.001 --> 05:56.921
Found a little surprise when
I cut the tape off his mouth.

06:01.133 --> 06:02.968
Fabric is our murder weapon.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.346
Either used to
shut him up or kill him.

06:05.763 --> 06:08.766
Either way, when he
started to struggle for air,

06:08.766 --> 06:10.768
it was sucked deeper
and deeper into his esophagus...

06:10.768 --> 06:12.311
until it had nowhere to go.

06:15.898 --> 06:17.066
This is the
tape from his mouth?

06:17.358 --> 06:18.401
Yeah.

06:25.658 --> 06:28.786
The tape was cut and not torn.

06:29.829 --> 06:31.914
That means we can look
for a tool mark somewhere.

06:32.456 --> 06:36.502
He was also sodomized violently--
most likely with a foreign object.

06:36.502 --> 06:39.213
His spleen and colon
are both damaged.

06:42.174 --> 06:43.259
What's this?

06:44.301 --> 06:47.012
Some kind of scar.

06:47.012 --> 06:49.014
Burn, maybe.

06:49.014 --> 06:51.100
Or a tattoo that's been lasered off.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.226
That's what I think.

06:52.226 --> 06:55.479
Seeing as we have no I.D. on this man
and there are no prints in the system...

06:55.479 --> 06:57.648
how hard would
it be to raise that?

06:59.483 --> 07:03.446
Never tried this procedure myself,
but, if the books are right ...

07:27.178 --> 07:29.138
Well, there you have it.
That is a thing of beauty.

07:29.346 --> 07:30.389
Unique.

07:40.608 --> 07:43.110
Alexx, we're working you
double time today, huh?

07:43.444 --> 07:44.612
I can handle it.

07:47.114 --> 07:51.202
Guy had the hell beat out of him.
His skull is fractured.

07:51.202 --> 07:53.913
Death was likely caused by internal
hemorrhaging in the brain.

07:54.413 --> 07:57.083
It was likely caused when his
head smashed into this wall.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.794
This'll crush a skull,
don't you think?

08:00.836 --> 08:02.755
Don't know where you are or
what's ahead of you but...

08:02.755 --> 08:04.840
I bet you figured out it wasn't
worth it, was it?

08:05.925 --> 08:07.718
Payback's a bitch, baby.

08:10.096 --> 08:10.846
How many?

08:10.846 --> 08:12.389
Twenty-seven and counting.

08:12.389 --> 08:14.934
The ones at the bottom are being
pieced back together.

08:15.559 --> 08:18.020
I just got back the check
I ran on Michelle Carter.

08:18.020 --> 08:20.689
She was reported missing
two weeks ago,

08:20.689 --> 08:23.275
last seen in a red dress,
red purse.

08:24.652 --> 08:26.612
Any of the bodies out back
dressed for a night out?

08:26.612 --> 08:27.696
Nope.

08:28.197 --> 08:30.241
Well, this jerk left
a body in the oven.

08:30.241 --> 08:31.909
It looks like it broke
down in mid-burn.

08:33.284 --> 08:34.745
Maybe it's Michelle Carter.

08:37.789 --> 08:40.751
Can you guys get a
positive I.D. from bones?

08:40.960 --> 08:44.630
Mitochondrial DNA only
gives us maternal lineage.

08:51.178 --> 08:53.597
There's not enough left
for facial reconstruction....

08:53.597 --> 08:56.225
but you can run the
teeth to check I.D.

08:57.351 --> 08:59.895
Takes three hours for
a body to burn through.

09:00.312 --> 09:04.150
The fire has to be between
1,600 and 2,000 degrees fahrenheit...

09:04.150 --> 09:05.943
to reduce the body to ash, ...

09:05.943 --> 09:08.279
... usually leaving about four...

09:08.279 --> 09:10.698
to eight pounds of bone
particles and dust.

09:10.990 --> 09:13.117
I used to think I wanted
to be cremated.

09:13.951 --> 09:14.994
Now I don't know.

09:15.202 --> 09:17.121
Looking like the bodies
outside are better?

09:17.121 --> 09:19.290
I don't know.
A casket-- embalmed--

09:19.290 --> 09:20.750
it's not going
to look like that.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.794
Hey, either way,
ashes to ashes.

09:26.213 --> 09:28.674
How about bloody ashes?
I've got some fresh blood here.

09:29.216 --> 09:31.427
Blood would've evaporated
before the bone broke down.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.764
But even if those are Michelle's
bones, it can't be her blood.

09:39.518 --> 09:40.561
I don't know ...

09:41.103 --> 09:42.730
Benito?

09:42.730 --> 09:44.065
He's got ash all over his face.

09:45.274 --> 09:47.151
Like Alexx said,
payback's a bitch.

10:13.594 --> 10:16.180
All Benito Ramon.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.141
The partial skull from
the crematorium chamber.

10:19.141 --> 10:23.437
Palatine sutures have fused
endocranially and exocranially.

10:23.437 --> 10:27.233
Now, I'm no forensic anthropologist
but I can estimate...

10:27.233 --> 10:28.984
this person was
over sixty years old.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.611
So Michelle is still missing.

10:30.903 --> 10:33.364
I ran all the blood
from inside the chamber.

10:33.364 --> 10:35.032
Belonged to Benito.

10:35.157 --> 10:37.493
He had a fractured skull,
broken jaw,

10:37.493 --> 10:40.204
clavicle three broken
ribs and this ...

10:41.080 --> 10:41.914
What is it?

10:41.914 --> 10:43.082
Don't know.

10:43.082 --> 10:44.834
He was holding something.

10:47.336 --> 10:48.754
Cadaveric spasm.

10:49.171 --> 10:51.632
Yeah.
The death grip.

10:51.966 --> 10:54.093
Happens sometimes
at the moment of death.

10:54.301 --> 10:56.929
I'm going to need my saw
and a microwave.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.774
I had to micro a
hand just last week.

11:08.774 --> 11:10.443
Only way we could get
the evidence out.

11:15.197 --> 11:15.906
Well, let her rip.

11:16.115 --> 11:17.074
Wait.

11:17.575 --> 11:20.619
Y'all are acting like this is no
big deal. That's someone's hand.

11:20.828 --> 11:22.663
Calleigh, you've picked up
body parts before.

11:22.788 --> 11:26.584
Yeah, but I've never
microwaved one, and it sort of ...

11:27.334 --> 11:29.003
freaks me out that y'all have.

11:31.547 --> 11:33.007
Okay, then.
All in a day's work.

11:44.059 --> 11:45.978
Whoa.
Fireworks.

11:45.978 --> 11:47.146
Must be something metal.

11:59.825 --> 12:01.327
What the hell is this?

12:03.204 --> 12:04.789
This is a pass to paradise.

12:05.623 --> 12:08.584
Ever heard of a club in
South Beach called Canvas?

12:09.001 --> 12:10.711
Yeah. I've been there
a couple of times.

12:10.711 --> 12:13.172
Yeah. Me, too. I spend
my whole damn paycheck.

12:13.464 --> 12:15.633
It's worth every dime, though.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.718
Never had one of these.

12:18.177 --> 12:20.262
If you've got a badge,
you don't need one.

12:24.767 --> 12:27.144
Speed, how are we doing?

12:28.896 --> 12:31.649
I'm just staring at a
lot of bad tattoos.

12:32.733 --> 12:33.526
You?

12:33.526 --> 12:37.696
The neighbors say he kept
odd hours and had no job.

12:38.781 --> 12:40.616
Well, that's weird.
That phat house?

12:41.033 --> 12:42.493
All those expensive toys?

12:45.287 --> 12:47.790
That doesn't look
like a prison tat.

12:48.082 --> 12:51.043
No, it doesn't.
There's too much detail.

12:51.043 --> 12:52.169
Have you run it through
the database?

12:52.169 --> 12:54.380
Yeah. Nothing.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.215
I also checked with Ernie,
the guy that did Calleigh's.

12:56.215 --> 12:57.258
Did Calleigh's?

12:57.383 --> 12:58.759
Yeah.

12:58.759 --> 13:01.929
Not that she's ever going
to let anybody see it, but uh,

13:01.929 --> 13:03.597
Ernie thinks this is one-of-a-kind.
Hang on ...

13:03.597 --> 13:05.683
Designed by ...
Hang on a minute.

13:11.272 --> 13:13.607
Designed by the tattoo
artist that did this one.

13:15.693 --> 13:16.944
That's not our victim.

13:16.944 --> 13:18.320
No, it's not.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.156
But he's got the
same tattoo, doesn't he?

13:20.156 --> 13:21.824
Bring up his
criminal history, will you?

13:23.909 --> 13:25.494
Name is Danny Blue.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.748
Released from prison,
get this five days ago...

13:29.039 --> 13:30.249
on a robbery conviction.

13:30.249 --> 13:32.835
Shocking. You know what?
Let's bring in Danny Blue.

14:22.465 --> 14:23.925
He's going to get the owners.

14:24.843 --> 14:27.637
Did you read the article in
Dade Distinctions about this place?

14:29.014 --> 14:31.266
Two guys from Puerto Rico,
they're cousins.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.184
I guess they had a
couple of clubs down there,

14:33.184 --> 14:37.564
but the article said they were Miami
versions of knock-around guys.

14:38.315 --> 14:39.608
Well, you know what they say.

14:39.608 --> 14:42.861
If you own the hottest club
in the city, you own the city.

14:45.864 --> 14:46.781
Here come our guys.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.243
Hey, guys.

14:50.243 --> 14:52.662
Michael Guerro, Jarod Parker.
How can we help you?

14:53.455 --> 14:55.165
Seen either one
of these two people?

14:58.501 --> 14:59.628
Benito Ramon.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.047
Michelle Carter.

15:02.964 --> 15:05.634
No. Sorry.
What's going on?

15:05.634 --> 15:06.968
The male had this on him.

15:11.264 --> 15:12.724
That's our VIP palette.

15:17.354 --> 15:19.439
He had it on his body.
He was murdered.

15:20.565 --> 15:22.025
Can we look at your VIP list?

15:22.484 --> 15:23.235
Sorry,

15:23.235 --> 15:26.029
but membership in our club comes
with an expectation of privacy,

15:26.029 --> 15:27.864
so, yeah, we mind.
It's okay.

15:27.864 --> 15:29.199
We'll come back with a warrant.

15:29.824 --> 15:30.784
Whatever you got to do.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.163
I think we found Michelle.

15:35.664 --> 15:36.706
Thank you.

15:43.838 --> 15:46.549
Okay, Danny Blue,
that wasn't too bad, was it?

15:47.926 --> 15:48.969
Tell me ...

15:50.262 --> 15:52.973
do you recognize
this gentleman?

15:55.600 --> 15:56.601
No. Doesn't ring a bell.

15:57.143 --> 15:58.186
How about this tattoo?

16:05.443 --> 16:06.861
Pull up your right sleeve, Danny.

16:08.321 --> 16:10.407
Do what your parole
officer says, Danny.

16:14.869 --> 16:16.454
So it does ring a bell.

16:18.331 --> 16:19.833
It's ... it's Thomas.

16:21.001 --> 16:22.043
Thomas Carpenter.

16:22.544 --> 16:23.378
What happened to him?

16:23.378 --> 16:25.297
He and Danny did
some robberies together.

16:25.297 --> 16:26.673
Danny got busted.

16:27.215 --> 16:29.175
Spent the last five years in prison.

16:30.427 --> 16:31.970
Without giving up your buddy?

16:31.970 --> 16:33.763
You guys both have
the same tattoo.

16:33.763 --> 16:35.223
You must be pretty close.

16:35.390 --> 16:36.891
Yeah, well, not that close.

16:36.891 --> 16:39.936
No? I'm going to need
a hair sample, Danny.

16:40.770 --> 16:44.608
Wha ... ? Don't you got to get
a warrant to do crap like that?

16:44.608 --> 16:47.903
Not when you're on parole
and we have hair samples and...

16:47.903 --> 16:49.696
fingerprints from
the murder scene.

16:49.738 --> 16:50.697
That's correct.

16:50.697 --> 16:53.199
So either you pull it out,
my friend, or I will.

17:02.584 --> 17:03.668
Thank you.

17:04.586 --> 17:07.923
So, Danny, are we going to find
your fingerprints at the crime scene?

17:08.131 --> 17:12.260
I was at his house a couple
days ago, but I didn't kill him.

17:12.260 --> 17:13.219
Convince me.

17:14.679 --> 17:15.472
Thomas, come on!

17:15.472 --> 17:16.806
I don't owe you a
damn thing, Danny!

17:16.806 --> 17:17.807
That's not what I'm saying!

17:17.807 --> 17:19.184
If you had
mentioned my name,

17:19.184 --> 17:20.560
you'd be dead now
instead of on parole.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.478
Come on.

17:21.478 --> 17:23.688
So you went to Carpenter's
to see what he was into.

17:23.688 --> 17:26.398
He turned you down,
but you figured he still owed you.

17:26.398 --> 17:28.108
Yeah, he did owe me.

17:28.108 --> 17:29.444
So you killed him.

17:30.487 --> 17:32.280
Not two days ago -- last night.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.241
No, I was at work last night.

17:34.574 --> 17:35.617
All night.
You can check it out.

17:35.617 --> 17:36.618
I intend to.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.871
What was Mr. Carpenter into?

17:40.789 --> 17:41.957
I don't know.

17:41.957 --> 17:43.416
Some scam --
said it was foolproof.

17:43.416 --> 17:44.584
Been working it
about a year.

17:45.418 --> 17:47.254
Look, he didn't
get into the details...

17:47.254 --> 17:49.172
'cause he got pissed off at me
and he kicked me out.

17:49.172 --> 17:50.090
That was two days ago.

17:50.090 --> 17:50.882
Two days ago ...

17:50.882 --> 17:53.301
but your scam wasn't
foolproof, was it, Danny?

17:53.301 --> 17:54.094
You're on parole.

17:54.094 --> 17:56.429
Just by meeting
with Mr. Carpenter,

17:56.429 --> 17:58.098
you violated a
condition, didn't you?

18:00.016 --> 18:02.102
Detective Bernstein,
he's all yours.

18:48.315 --> 18:50.191
How much of this stuff
did this guy rip off?

18:50.609 --> 18:52.611
Judging by the
size of this house,

18:52.611 --> 18:54.404
I would have to say
most of it, wouldn't you?

18:55.822 --> 18:56.865
Let's bag that.

18:57.282 --> 18:58.617
"Erin love Leonard."

18:59.659 --> 19:01.119
Hey, can you add
this to the list?

19:01.119 --> 19:02.537
Sure.
Thank you.

19:02.537 --> 19:03.413
What'd you get?

19:03.413 --> 19:05.957
I compared Danny Blue's
hair sample ...

19:05.957 --> 19:09.419
to the hairs I found on the
victim's bed. No match.

19:09.419 --> 19:11.296
So, maybe he was
telling the truth.

19:11.296 --> 19:14.257
Oh, and I also
compared the swabs...

19:14.257 --> 19:17.052
Alexx took from the victim's
head wound and rectum.

19:17.552 --> 19:19.512
They both had traces of rust.

19:20.138 --> 19:22.223
Likely from a corroded
iron pipe.

19:22.515 --> 19:24.392
Okay, excellent.
You know what?

19:24.976 --> 19:26.061
Let's bag this, too.

19:26.603 --> 19:27.687
You got it.

19:28.605 --> 19:29.397
Hey.

19:30.649 --> 19:31.691
This diamond bracelet?

19:32.943 --> 19:34.861
Worth about thirty grand.

19:34.861 --> 19:37.572
Reported stolen by a Judy
Johnson three weeks ago.

19:38.698 --> 19:40.784
She also reported a 268.

19:42.118 --> 19:43.703
A 268?

19:43.703 --> 19:45.121
So he's not just a b-and-e guy.

19:45.121 --> 19:46.164
He's a rapist, too.

19:46.164 --> 19:47.249
Gets better.

19:47.332 --> 19:49.834
It gets better than a
rapist being raped? How?

19:50.168 --> 19:52.504
He wrapped electrical
tape around her hands,

19:52.504 --> 19:54.881
ankles and mouth before
he sodomized her.

19:54.881 --> 19:56.007
He also gagged her.

19:56.132 --> 19:59.678
So someone used his
own M.O. on him, didn't they?

19:59.678 --> 20:01.346
Yeah. Makes for poetic justice.

20:01.346 --> 20:04.724
It also makes miss
Judy Johnson a suspect.

20:05.016 --> 20:08.061
Except she committed suicide
one week after he raped her.

20:09.521 --> 20:10.855
Did she have a
distraught boyfriend...

20:10.855 --> 20:12.107
or husband hanging around?

20:12.107 --> 20:13.191
She was married.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.151
She was married?

20:15.151 --> 20:16.528
Well, let's find the husband then.

20:17.362 --> 20:18.905
Way to go, Riboul.

20:18.905 --> 20:21.533
Michelle Carter in
a shallow grave.

20:21.575 --> 20:23.910
Can you believe she was
buried under all those bodies?

20:23.910 --> 20:25.161
I believe it now.

20:31.626 --> 20:33.128
Are those scratches
all over her face?

20:33.128 --> 20:35.755
No.
Postmortem rodent bites.

20:37.924 --> 20:39.593
She might have also
been beaten.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.140
I've got something
in her hair.

21:00.363 --> 21:02.824
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:03.033 --> 21:04.326
What's all over her skin?

21:04.951 --> 21:06.202
Tell you in a sec.

21:09.831 --> 21:10.874
Looks like paint.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.001
It looks like fluorescent paint.

21:13.001 --> 21:16.129
Like the kind of paint they
were using at Club Canvas.

21:16.129 --> 21:17.964
If Michelle worked
in the paint,

21:17.964 --> 21:19.549
she was a dancer at the club.

21:21.384 --> 21:22.427
The owners were lying.

21:26.598 --> 21:29.643
We know your wife killed
herself one week after...

21:29.643 --> 21:33.104
she was raped, Mr. Johnson.
We're sorry for your loss.

21:35.482 --> 21:36.733
Did you find the guy that did it?

21:37.234 --> 21:38.360
We think so.

21:39.194 --> 21:41.488
Good.
Charge him with murder.

21:43.657 --> 21:45.408
Better yet, just give me five
minutes alone with him.

21:45.492 --> 21:48.703
Well, it would appear that someone's
beaten you to the punch, Mr. Johnson.

21:48.703 --> 21:51.081
Saturday night--
where were you?

21:51.081 --> 21:52.123
Out with some friends. Why?

21:52.123 --> 21:55.627
Because someone got
revenge on your wife's rapist.

21:56.044 --> 21:59.089
Someone who knew that he
tied up his victims with tape,

21:59.089 --> 22:01.591
gagged them and sodomized
them in their own home.

22:03.593 --> 22:04.552
You think it was me.

22:04.552 --> 22:05.971
Well, whoever it was...

22:05.971 --> 22:08.056
knew an awful lot about what
happened to your wife.

22:09.349 --> 22:11.977
If it was me,
would you blame me?

22:12.602 --> 22:13.979
Are you saying it was you?

22:15.855 --> 22:16.773
No.

22:18.733 --> 22:20.360
I thought you
brought me in here...

22:20.360 --> 22:21.820
to tell me something
about Judy's case.

22:23.947 --> 22:25.448
But you're actually...

22:25.448 --> 22:28.034
helping the bastard
that raped my wife...

22:28.034 --> 22:29.703
because someone
hurt him, right?

22:30.912 --> 22:32.831
Are you serious?
Are you really serious?

22:33.039 --> 22:34.541
The M.O.'S match exactly.

22:34.749 --> 22:37.043
Of course I know how
my wife was raped.

22:38.086 --> 22:39.796
Every detail.

22:41.548 --> 22:42.924
I also know how she died...

22:42.924 --> 22:44.384
because I'm the one that
found her with the scissors...

22:44.384 --> 22:45.760
still stuck in her arm.

22:46.386 --> 22:47.554
Did you say scissors?

22:48.305 --> 22:49.306
Yes.

22:49.306 --> 22:51.308
Okay, I'm going to need
to take a look at those.

22:54.144 --> 22:55.770
You people are unbelievable.

22:57.522 --> 22:59.816
How can you care more about
the rapist than his victim?

23:11.325 --> 23:13.494
The semen samples...

23:13.494 --> 23:17.039
taken from Judy Johnson are a
dead DNA match...

23:17.039 --> 23:19.875
to Thomas Carpenter, which
confirms that he raped her, right?

23:19.959 --> 23:21.544
Yeah. Check this out.

23:22.044 --> 23:23.087
She wasn't the only one.

23:25.214 --> 23:26.590
There were three other victims.

23:27.133 --> 23:29.427
Three others?
Were they all robbed?

23:30.261 --> 23:31.053
Yep.

23:31.053 --> 23:32.513
Okay, well, Danny Blue...

23:33.597 --> 23:36.434
said that Carpenter was working
on a foolproof scam ...

23:36.434 --> 23:38.060
for the better part
of a year, right?

23:38.060 --> 23:39.395
Yeah. So what's the scam?

23:39.520 --> 23:42.773
It's my guess that he was
making his living as a thief,

23:43.190 --> 23:45.067
but getting his
power from the rapes.

23:46.110 --> 23:49.613
Medical Examiner confirmed
that none of the women...

23:49.613 --> 23:52.533
had been raped
vaginally -- all sodomized.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.493
And he tells them,
if they go to the police,

23:54.493 --> 23:55.494
that he'll come back
to get them.

23:55.494 --> 23:59.457
So his scam could be that he
threatened his victims into silence.

23:59.665 --> 24:03.169
Maybe one of the victims
turned the tables on him.

24:03.169 --> 24:04.503
That's possible, isn't it?

24:05.463 --> 24:06.505
Question becomes who?

24:06.589 --> 24:09.216
Well, the three other
victims left Miami after...

24:09.216 --> 24:10.551
they filed police
reports.

24:10.551 --> 24:13.095
But Judy Johnson stayed
behind and did what?

24:13.095 --> 24:14.972
She stayed behind
and killed herself.

24:15.222 --> 24:16.515
Her husband's
alibi check out?

24:16.515 --> 24:17.892
Not conclusively.

24:18.184 --> 24:22.021
We can nail a grieving husband
for killing his wife's rapist.

24:23.064 --> 24:24.106
That's good.

24:24.648 --> 24:27.651
I mean, I think the guy
deserves a medal, don't you?

24:28.569 --> 24:29.737
Let's go find out.

24:36.035 --> 24:36.952
Please be careful.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.789
Would you rather we take
the whole thing back...

24:39.789 --> 24:42.083
to the lab for processing?
That won't be necessary.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.543
Crime Scene Investigators
Duquesne and Delko...

24:44.543 --> 24:48.172
meet Vincent Graziano,
legal counsel for the club.

24:48.297 --> 24:51.425
Take note. We are cooperating
with your investigation.

24:51.425 --> 24:54.053
It's funny how warrants
bring out the best in people.

24:56.472 --> 24:57.681
List of members,

24:59.183 --> 25:00.226
list of employees.

25:00.810 --> 25:03.437
So Benito Ramon
was a member, after all.

25:03.979 --> 25:06.273
Says here that Michelle Carter
is an employee.

25:06.565 --> 25:07.817
She worked as a
painter?

25:16.450 --> 25:20.037
And if Michelle was an employee,
then that would make Jarod a liar.

25:21.580 --> 25:22.665
You've got nothing to hide.

25:23.082 --> 25:25.042
When Michelle
was first missing,

25:25.042 --> 25:26.585
the police came here
asking questions.

25:26.752 --> 25:29.130
When you showed up,
I figured that can't be good.

25:29.130 --> 25:31.465
So you decided to make
things worse by...

25:31.465 --> 25:33.050
hindering our investigation?

25:33.300 --> 25:35.469
I admit I lied about Michelle,

25:35.469 --> 25:38.055
but I was telling the truth
about Benito Ramon.

25:39.265 --> 25:41.600
I give my word.
I've never seen him before.

25:42.685 --> 25:44.854
We know how much that means.
We'll be in touch.

25:51.026 --> 25:51.819
How's it going?

25:53.696 --> 25:55.990
Striations on
Judy Johnson's scissors...

25:55.990 --> 25:58.492
don't match the striations
on Carpenter's tape.

25:58.826 --> 26:01.787
Try these. Took me
longer to process this pair.

26:02.413 --> 26:05.583
So the only DNA I found on
the blades was Judy Johnson's.

26:07.543 --> 26:08.544
Nice job, Laura.

26:10.504 --> 26:12.298
She used these
to slit her wrists?

26:13.632 --> 26:16.552
Let's see if the husband
used them to avenge her.

26:30.107 --> 26:30.858
Close?

26:30.858 --> 26:32.818
Not close enough.

26:33.861 --> 26:36.072
Okay, means the
husband didn't do it.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.573
Not with those
scissors, anyway.

26:37.573 --> 26:39.492
We'll have to go back
to the murder weapon.

26:39.575 --> 26:40.618
Which was?

26:41.952 --> 26:43.037
Fabric.

26:46.665 --> 26:48.751
Cause of death was strangulation.

26:49.919 --> 26:51.087
No surprise here.

26:51.420 --> 26:52.546
The paint in Michelle's hair...

26:52.546 --> 26:54.632
matches the paint chips
we took from Club Canvas.

26:55.466 --> 26:56.467
Is that a UV photo?

26:56.467 --> 26:58.594
No. I took this post-autopsy.

26:58.886 --> 27:00.179
To get the UV photo,

27:00.179 --> 27:03.724
all I did was add an ultraviolet
filter and flood her face with light.

27:04.308 --> 27:06.018
UV light penetrates the skin...

27:06.018 --> 27:09.146
and picks up bruises and marks too
deep to be seen under normal light.

27:09.313 --> 27:12.233
Any bruising that's already visible
won't show up on a UV photo.

27:12.650 --> 27:15.069
Like that mark on her cheek?
What is that?

27:19.323 --> 27:20.616
Looks like a horseshoe.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.326
Or the letter "C."

27:23.077 --> 27:24.286
As in Club Canvas.

27:24.286 --> 27:27.498
As in the rings Jarod Parker and
Michael Guerra both wear.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.126
I'll have Riboul bring them in.

27:41.053 --> 27:42.054
Nice tie.

27:42.888 --> 27:44.140
You're desperate, aren't you?

27:45.516 --> 27:47.143
Well, you are the king of fibers.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.811
And you are lucky.

27:49.729 --> 27:51.188
These fibers are man-made.

27:53.566 --> 27:55.568
Animal, vegetable or
mineral fibers...

27:55.568 --> 27:57.027
would be impossible to trace.

27:57.194 --> 27:58.612
Man-made fibers...

27:58.612 --> 28:01.741
are produced on machines
that leave distinct markings.

28:02.241 --> 28:04.994
And these cross-sectional shapes
are unique to that machine.

28:04.994 --> 28:06.996
Both fabrics are made
by the same company and,

28:06.996 --> 28:09.373
since manufacturers don't
duplicate each other's dyes ...

28:09.373 --> 28:11.000
We identify the dyes,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.711
trace it back to a design house
might lead us to a suspect.

28:13.794 --> 28:15.463
I've already done all the above.

28:15.796 --> 28:19.341
The dye is made by a
company called RGJ textiles.

28:19.341 --> 28:22.219
Now, according to their web site,
that fabric is available through...

28:22.219 --> 28:24.513
ten different design
houses here in Miami.

28:25.473 --> 28:26.640
Did it say which ones?

28:26.849 --> 28:28.392
No, but I found out for you.

28:29.769 --> 28:32.063
See, a lesser tech
would have left it at that.

28:32.354 --> 28:34.774
I, however, am nothing
if not thorough.

28:36.442 --> 28:39.111
And yet, your
handwriting is terrible.

28:40.154 --> 28:41.072
What does it say?

28:41.072 --> 28:42.406
Murphy home decor.

28:42.406 --> 28:44.116
Owners are Leonard
and Erin Murphy.

28:45.701 --> 28:47.536
Leonard and Erin.

28:50.581 --> 28:52.917
Thomas Carpenter
had expensive taste.

28:53.667 --> 28:57.588
But what he can't do is fence an item
with someone's name engraved on it.

28:57.588 --> 29:00.800
"Happy Anniversary
Erin love Leonard."

29:01.342 --> 29:03.886
Got to have some sentimental
value to these people.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.972
She never reported it stolen.

29:07.890 --> 29:09.683
Maybe she had a
good reason not to.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.651
My clients have a club to run.

29:18.651 --> 29:20.152
This is bordering on
harassment.

29:20.152 --> 29:22.071
I can assure you
it's perfectly legal.

29:22.071 --> 29:25.366
Just the same, I advise them not
to answer any of your questions.

29:25.366 --> 29:27.701
That's fine.
I can get the answers myself.

29:27.701 --> 29:29.703
All I need are their rings.

29:29.703 --> 29:30.579
Why?

29:30.579 --> 29:31.914
You know how much
these things cost?

29:31.914 --> 29:33.207
This is because of
Michelle?

29:33.207 --> 29:34.208
Michael.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.543
What about Michelle?

29:35.543 --> 29:38.045
You opened the door.
If you don't close it, we will.

29:41.757 --> 29:43.008
I discovered Michelle.

29:43.926 --> 29:46.345
The deal was, she would work
exclusively for us.

29:46.679 --> 29:48.264
But she decided to branch out?

29:48.389 --> 29:49.598
She wanted to be a promoter.

29:51.225 --> 29:52.184
You know, she had the looks.

29:52.184 --> 29:53.769
Talked the talk, walked the walk.

29:54.395 --> 29:56.230
Stepped on a lot
of toes in the process.

29:56.647 --> 29:59.692
She started hosting events
at a place called the Thorny Rose.

30:04.613 --> 30:05.614
Why don't you talk to them?

30:05.614 --> 30:06.574
I will ...

30:06.991 --> 30:09.201
right after your clients
give me their rings.

30:23.340 --> 30:24.633
These rings are clean.

30:25.259 --> 30:27.511
No way. There's no blood,
no epithelials?

30:27.511 --> 30:29.722
No cremation ash, no nothing.

30:29.722 --> 30:30.765
Maybe they cleaned them.

30:30.765 --> 30:33.309
Maybe they used some
cleaning fluid-- bleach, maybe.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.603
Could prove that they
tried to destroy evidence.

30:35.936 --> 30:38.272
Well, Jarod and Michael are clean.

30:40.441 --> 30:41.484
I doubt that.

31:04.423 --> 31:05.674
Horatio, take a look at this.

31:12.890 --> 31:13.849
Hi.

31:15.059 --> 31:16.435
You guys want to be
on our mailing list?

31:16.560 --> 31:17.770
Leonard Murphy?

31:18.396 --> 31:19.188
Um, yeah.

31:19.188 --> 31:22.316
We'd like to talk to your wife Erin.
Can we speak to her?

31:22.400 --> 31:23.692
Sure.
Follow me.

31:24.735 --> 31:28.406
You know what? Let's get the
mailing list back to the lab, all right?

31:48.092 --> 31:49.135
Erin?
Yeah?

31:49.552 --> 31:50.636
Erin Murphy?

31:50.636 --> 31:51.887
Yes. Can I help you?

31:52.096 --> 31:53.806
I'd like to talk to
you for a minute.

31:54.223 --> 31:55.725
Okay. What about?

31:56.475 --> 31:59.019
Well, as it turns out,
it's about one of your customers.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.563
Okay.

32:01.188 --> 32:03.149
Why don't you and
I go talk downstairs?

32:03.649 --> 32:04.650
You going to be all right, hon?

32:04.650 --> 32:05.693
Uh, yeah.

32:06.736 --> 32:08.946
This'll only take a minute, okay?

32:12.658 --> 32:15.995
His name is
Thomas Carpenter.

32:17.079 --> 32:18.664
Does he seem familiar to you?

32:19.498 --> 32:22.168
No. My husband
works out front more.

32:22.168 --> 32:24.837
I do the buying, designing.
What happened to him?

32:24.837 --> 32:26.630
Well, he was murdered.

32:27.673 --> 32:31.552
And we believe he was
murdered to avenge a rape.

32:33.095 --> 32:34.638
I'm sorry I can't help.

32:36.515 --> 32:37.767
Well, actually, you can.

32:37.767 --> 32:41.437
I'm going to need all of the
scissors that I see present...

32:41.437 --> 32:42.646
and a sample of your hair.

32:42.646 --> 32:44.190
A sample of my hair?

32:48.976 --> 32:50.811
We're going back
to Club Canvas?

32:50.811 --> 32:53.313
Riboul tracked down the jeweler
that made Jarod and Michael's rings.

32:53.313 --> 32:54.648
Okay, but you said
they were clean.

32:54.648 --> 32:56.483
Well, they are, but they
weren't the only ones made.

32:56.483 --> 32:58.402
There were three rings
made for Club Canvas.

32:58.402 --> 32:59.820
So, there's a silent partner?

32:59.820 --> 33:01.446
Not so silent anymore.

33:04.132 --> 33:07.427
You think I was raped?
Is this a joke?

33:07.427 --> 33:09.554
I can assure you
this is no joke.

33:09.679 --> 33:11.681
I think you've got some
wrong information.

33:11.681 --> 33:14.518
If I was raped, trust me,
the police would know about it.

33:14.518 --> 33:16.937
Why didn't you report your
home being burglarized?

33:16.937 --> 33:18.939
Because it wasn't.

33:18.939 --> 33:21.608
Obviously, you've got me
mixed up with someone else.

33:23.485 --> 33:25.862
Do you, um, own one of these?

33:28.573 --> 33:29.658
I did.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.953
There must be thousands
of those vases.

33:33.412 --> 33:36.623
The problem is,
is that this one is inscribed to....

33:36.623 --> 33:39.000
"Erin love Leonard."

33:40.961 --> 33:44.047
But ours shattered
into a million pieces.

33:44.047 --> 33:47.926
It ... it fell off a shelf when my
husband was moving furniture.

33:47.926 --> 33:51.513
He called me while I was overseas
buying fabric to tell me.

33:51.638 --> 33:52.806
When did this happen?

33:53.557 --> 33:55.851
A month ago, a couple
of months, I don't know.

33:56.393 --> 33:58.687
Would you please
tell me what's going on?

33:59.021 --> 34:01.565
I will, but first you tell me
what happened to your arm.

34:02.816 --> 34:03.942
My cat jumped on me.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.319
She gets excited when I come
home from my trips.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.530
Your trips?
Your fabric-buying trips?

34:08.530 --> 34:10.282
Yes. I've been in
India for two weeks.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.367
I just got back last night.

34:36.183 --> 34:37.684
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.228
I don't have a
canvas club "C" ring.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.605
That strip of white,

34:41.605 --> 34:45.317
fish-belly skin on an otherwise
tan hand proves, until recently,

34:45.317 --> 34:46.985
you were wearing
a ring on that finger.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.154
Yeah, you must have never
heard about that guy in L.A.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.947
with the Bruno Magli's?

34:54.826 --> 34:57.287
The police are at your house
right now looking for your ring.

34:58.038 --> 35:00.499
Fantastic. Let me know
when they're finished.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.502
Until then,
I think I'll have a drink.

35:03.919 --> 35:04.920
I don't think so.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.380
You're coming with us.

35:16.681 --> 35:20.185
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
and a suspect's worst enemy.

35:20.268 --> 35:23.355
The setting was a perfect
reservoir for Michelle's blood.

35:23.772 --> 35:24.815
Try it on.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.535
What do you know?

35:36.535 --> 35:39.162
It fits.
Quite a coincidence.

35:39.162 --> 35:40.539
I've got another one for you.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.834
It turns out you're more than just
legal counsel for the club.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.585
You're the majority owner.

35:45.919 --> 35:46.920
As a matter of fact,

35:46.920 --> 35:50.048
Michael and Jarod combined
own less than one percent.

35:50.590 --> 35:53.468
I needed someone with
personality to attract customers.

35:53.468 --> 35:55.011
I wanted my business
to be successful.

35:55.011 --> 35:57.514
Unlike the other two clubs
you had that failed miserably.

35:57.514 --> 36:00.892
You filed for bankruptcy after both
"Moist" and "Belly Button" were closed.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.437
Proves I'm a bad businessman,
not a murderer.

36:03.437 --> 36:06.148
It proves you have a vested
interest in making Club Canvas...

36:06.148 --> 36:07.315
the hottest club
on the beach,

36:07.315 --> 36:09.234
which you did,
by eliminating the competition.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.819
Competition like Michelle.

36:11.028 --> 36:13.822
Michelle used Club Canvas
to create a name...

36:13.822 --> 36:17.325
and she used her name to lure your
VIPs to events at other clubs...

36:17.325 --> 36:18.035
her events.

36:31.465 --> 36:34.176
Michelle was a threat,
so you decided to get rid of her.

36:35.510 --> 36:36.386
Hey, Michelle!

36:37.012 --> 36:39.139
You think I'm gonna let you
steal my customers?

36:39.139 --> 36:40.724
I own you, bitch!

36:46.897 --> 36:48.190
And, after you killed her,

36:48.190 --> 36:50.400
you knew exactly how
to get rid of her body...

36:50.400 --> 36:52.736
and you gave Benito Ramon
a VIP membership ...

36:52.736 --> 36:54.404
in exchange for his services.

36:56.406 --> 36:59.409
Burn her, Benito.
Burn her stuff, too.

37:00.660 --> 37:03.872
You thought everything connecting
you to her murder had been disposed...

37:03.872 --> 37:05.540
of until you
went back to pay Ramon.

37:08.502 --> 37:09.503
What are you doing here?

37:09.503 --> 37:10.879
I owe you, remember?

37:12.881 --> 37:14.341
But when you got there,

37:14.341 --> 37:16.176
you saw a few things
you didn't expect.

37:16.176 --> 37:17.761
Why didn't you burn her purse?

37:18.178 --> 37:19.221
The chamber was broken.

37:24.267 --> 37:26.478
Michelle's body
hadn't been cremated...

37:28.563 --> 37:30.107
... so you killed Benito Ramon.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.069
The chamber's broken.
Don't worry! I'll cremate her!

37:47.207 --> 37:48.875
Because you knew
that a buried body...

37:48.875 --> 37:53.046
still contained DNA, but one
cremated to ash doesn't.

37:53.296 --> 37:56.007
No DNA ...
no proof Michelle's dead.

38:02.055 --> 38:04.766
That's a good story.
I enjoyed that.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.602
But you forgot one thing ...

38:07.602 --> 38:09.771
I'm a lawyer,
a damn good one.

38:10.063 --> 38:11.064
Oh, you know what?
You're right.

38:11.064 --> 38:12.691
I did forget one thing:

38:12.691 --> 38:15.527
Michelle's blood wasn't the
only one we found on the ring.

38:15.777 --> 38:17.571
Benito Ramon's
was there, as well.

38:18.071 --> 38:19.990
And cremated ash,

38:19.990 --> 38:23.118
and the chances of that happening
to anyone but the murderer are...

38:23.118 --> 38:24.953
about a million to one.

38:24.953 --> 38:26.913
You may be a lawyer,

38:26.913 --> 38:28.457
but I'm a CSI.

38:28.457 --> 38:30.125
A damn good one.

38:48.810 --> 38:49.561
You rang?

38:49.561 --> 38:51.229
Erin Murphy still here?

38:51.646 --> 38:53.482
Voluntarily, for the time being.
How we doing?

38:54.524 --> 38:56.109
I'm finished.
Take a look at that.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.490
Okay ...

39:04.618 --> 39:08.789
These are the scissors that cut
the tape we found on Thomas.

39:12.209 --> 39:14.378
All right.
You don't look too happy.

39:15.128 --> 39:18.340
Well, it turns out
that Erin Murphy...

39:18.340 --> 39:20.926
was on a plane at the
time of the murder.

39:21.051 --> 39:22.302
So that leaves the husband.

39:22.302 --> 39:24.596
She claims that she's
never been raped.

39:24.805 --> 39:26.348
Well, maybe she's still afraid.

39:30.018 --> 39:33.230
And maybe we're talking
to the wrong victim.

39:34.356 --> 39:35.691
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:35.691 --> 39:39.277
Leonard, I can get a court order in
here for a doctor's examination,

39:39.277 --> 39:40.278
if that's what you want.

39:40.278 --> 39:41.488
You're wrong.

39:43.865 --> 39:46.159
I can place you in
Thomas Carpenter's bed.

39:47.536 --> 39:48.370
It never happened.

39:48.370 --> 39:49.287
Leonard ...

39:49.287 --> 39:51.873
I said it never happened.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.459
Leonard ...

39:55.502 --> 39:57.879
you were raped and
you couldn't live with it.

40:02.718 --> 40:03.510
I thought, uh ...

40:05.303 --> 40:07.347
I was just trying to get by.

40:07.347 --> 40:08.390
Not deal with it.

40:11.184 --> 40:12.519
I was so messed up.

40:14.187 --> 40:16.481
And then he just walked
into my store one day.

40:20.902 --> 40:21.903
Excuse me a second.

40:22.946 --> 40:24.448
Shopping for fabric.

40:24.531 --> 40:27.159
So you recognized him,
but he didn't recognize you.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.746
I wanted to kill him.

40:33.248 --> 40:34.833
So you got his address ...

40:35.250 --> 40:38.378
Why don't you write down your name
and address for our mailing list.

40:41.381 --> 40:42.924
And you decided
to even the score.

40:49.306 --> 40:54.561
You went to his place to do to
him what he'd done to you. Right?

40:57.064 --> 40:57.898
What are you doing here?

40:57.898 --> 41:00.817
I just thought I'd bring some fabric
samples by for you to look at.

41:19.169 --> 41:21.546
So that's how it happened.

41:23.507 --> 41:24.549
An eye for an eye.

41:25.509 --> 41:26.510
I didn't start this.

41:26.510 --> 41:29.429
No ... no,
you didn't start it,

41:29.429 --> 41:30.680
but you finished it.

41:31.807 --> 41:33.183
I wanted justice.

41:34.559 --> 41:38.397
Leonard, justice is not
for you to dispense.

41:40.023 --> 41:41.692
And now you're
going to pay for it.
