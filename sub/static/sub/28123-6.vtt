01:00.040 --> 01:02.450
[RuPaul] Previously on
RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:02.450 --> 01:05.350
We are throwing a monster ball.

01:05.350 --> 01:07.550
[howling]

01:07.550 --> 01:08.720
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.250
This looks messy.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.560
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.860
There is nothing monstrous
about this.

01:14.860 --> 01:15.860
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.660
[Cara] That was incredible.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.000
[RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.070
[Vanjie] Yes.
[applause]

01:22.070 --> 01:24.700
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain,
shantay you stay.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.870
Ariel Versace, sashay away.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.440
Nyes.

01:36.910 --> 01:38.850
Jesus, y'all.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.120
This is like the worst.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.750
But the best, but the worst.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.990
[Shuga Cain] Miss Ariel
just went home,

01:44.990 --> 01:47.920
and I am feeling
some type of way right now.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.330
Ariel, we love you, Jersey.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.590
Love you so much, Ariel.

01:50.590 --> 01:51.660
We love you, girl.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.900
I love you, Ariel.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.330
[Shuga Cain] I thought
coming into this competition

01:56.330 --> 01:58.840
that I was going to do so much
better than I'm doing now.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.040
Bitch, they read me to filth.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.170
And it's like, it's frustrating.

02:03.170 --> 02:05.010
I thought this look was cute.

02:06.580 --> 02:09.610
How does everybody else feel
about, like, critiques, like?

02:09.610 --> 02:11.410
I was in the bottom
for being beautiful.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.520
So you know what?
It works for me.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.950
And if I got to lip sync
for my life,

02:14.950 --> 02:17.090
I'm gonna lip sync for my
motherfucking life beautifully.

02:17.090 --> 02:18.590
[Yvie] But like Ru's been

02:18.590 --> 02:21.720
particularly poignant
about don't be safe.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.390
[Vanjie] I thought
what I brought was fierce.

02:24.390 --> 02:26.660
I thought I looked sickening.
I felt sickening.

02:26.660 --> 02:28.060
But I was safe.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.930
[Yvie] Well, she was safe
because it was still the same

02:29.930 --> 02:32.670
silhouette that the judges
critiqued you on changing.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.870
Let me tell you this.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.870
She wore a corset and a panty
both times.

02:35.870 --> 02:37.810
[Yvie] I'm just saying the Tee
is that the judges already

02:37.810 --> 02:39.980
critiqued you on having
the same silhouette,

02:39.980 --> 02:42.210
so now, bitch,
time to change it up.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.610
Ain't nobody asking for
your opinion, peanut gallery.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.920
Sometimes the old school phrase

02:46.920 --> 02:48.180
if you don't got
nothing nice to say,

02:48.180 --> 02:50.990
just let those bitches go home,
sometimes that applies.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.460
That can be hard for a lot
of people only because

02:53.460 --> 02:55.120
the only thing you have
is what you brought.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.360
You telling Vanjie
to step her clothes up,

02:57.360 --> 03:00.300
but if a person don't sew,
how does she step it up?

03:00.300 --> 03:01.900
Start wearing pillow cases?

03:01.900 --> 03:03.470
Cutting up the couch?

03:03.470 --> 03:05.270
They said Vanjie
bring the same silhouette,

03:05.270 --> 03:09.040
but how can she improve
what she already has?

03:09.040 --> 03:11.270
Hold on. I wore a--the first one
was a panty and a corset.

03:11.270 --> 03:13.110
The second one was a gown.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.080
So I didn't bring the same
silhouette three times.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.750
I'm not fucking coming for you,

03:16.750 --> 03:18.350
and your goddamn
same silhouette.

03:18.350 --> 03:21.150
I'm just saying if you don't
want to be fucking safe again,

03:21.150 --> 03:23.020
then change up some shit.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.820
Is that shit wrong?

03:24.820 --> 03:28.160
You know everything what to say.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.930
Once again, I hear like
these girls making excuses.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.560
Get the fuck over it.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.430
We have a fabric wall.

03:34.430 --> 03:36.130
There's plenty of stones.

03:36.130 --> 03:38.170
There's so many scissors.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.200
If the judges are getting bored
by what you're doing,

03:40.200 --> 03:43.110
then go back into your drag
and change it.

03:43.110 --> 03:46.140
Aight, you gonna give glamour?

03:46.140 --> 03:47.880
My critique this week
was stay true to me, bitch.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.650
You got quite opposite critique.

03:49.650 --> 03:50.650
[Vanjie]
Mama, I heard--I heard the--

03:50.650 --> 03:52.420
Quite opposite.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.750
Don't get defensive, mama.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.090
Miss Yvie bumps her gum all day.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.350
Wigs.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.890
But the bitch
only gives you spooky Tee.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.160
There's not much more
than spook.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.100
And I'll tell you, wait until
they make that spooky dooky...

04:08.230 --> 04:09.130
Go home.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.840

[singing]

04:38.460 --> 04:39.460
[laughs]

04:39.460 --> 04:40.800
[Brooke Lynn] It is a new day,

04:40.800 --> 04:42.370
and there's still
way too many of us left here.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.530
-Oh.
-Suck it, suck it.

04:44.530 --> 04:45.740
It's like a house party

04:45.740 --> 04:46.970
and people just don't know
when to leave.

04:46.970 --> 04:50.470
Silky, how does it feel
to be in the bottom three?

04:50.470 --> 04:53.240
[laughs]

04:53.240 --> 04:58.210
The shade at the beginning
of the day is real, honey.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.350
[Silky] You know what?

04:59.350 --> 05:01.380
I don't believe
that I belong there.

05:01.380 --> 05:03.150
I did motherfucking Evillene,

05:03.150 --> 05:05.350
and some ho's don't know
what Evillene is.

05:05.350 --> 05:07.560
You keep playing
on that Evillene, girl,

05:07.560 --> 05:09.190
but we had three looks
on the runway.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.630
It's always been drama,
'cause bitch hate on my beauty.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.530
I would never be spooky,

05:15.530 --> 05:17.830
but, bitch,
would you ever be glam?

05:17.830 --> 05:20.040
You will never be glam!
Don't come for me.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.300
Oh, girl, I hope
you're not talking to me,

05:21.300 --> 05:24.340
'cause I'm about
to send your ass packing.

05:24.340 --> 05:27.080
Ooh. I can't wait till we're
in the bottom two together.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.580
There's a lot you don't know
about me, bitch.

05:28.580 --> 05:29.880
[Vanjie] Thank God.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.250
[RuPaul] She done already
done had herses.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.520
Attention,
worldwide skorts fans.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.960
This competition isn't just
a race, it's a marathon.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.460
So pop the corn
and feed the children.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.730
Back to you, Bob.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.900
Hello, hello, hello.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.400
[cheers]

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
Whew.
I've been working out.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.440
Whew.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.770
I am gagged.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.310
So out of breath.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.480
[all laugh]

06:01.480 --> 06:04.550
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar

06:04.550 --> 06:07.650
needs to keep her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

06:07.650 --> 06:10.590
as tight as possible
at all times.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.820
[all laugh]

06:11.820 --> 06:15.790
Which is why I exercise
11 times a day

06:15.790 --> 06:19.530
and eat three sensible meals.

06:19.530 --> 06:20.530
Per month.

06:20.530 --> 06:22.800
[all laugh]

06:22.800 --> 06:24.370
So for today's Mini Challenge,

06:24.370 --> 06:28.700
I'm treating you to the latest
Hollywood workout craze.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.440

06:42.650 --> 06:45.920
[cheers and laughter]

06:45.920 --> 06:47.390
Go!

06:47.390 --> 06:49.030
Oh, my God.

06:50.430 --> 06:52.090
[RuPaul] Time's up, ladies.

06:52.090 --> 06:56.270
You know, as a celebrity,
I have access

06:56.270 --> 07:01.170
to some of the most exclusive
fitness regimes in the world.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.610
And today I want you
to meet a person

07:04.610 --> 07:06.680
who has truly changed my life.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.650
Please give a warm
Drag Race welcome to...

07:11.650 --> 07:13.350
Love Connie.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.750
[cheers and applause]

07:18.450 --> 07:20.760
[Nina] I'm really familiar
with Love Connie.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.890
Love Connie is known
for these Jane Fonda-esque

07:23.890 --> 07:26.630
1980s-inspired
workout video looks.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.100
It's partially scag,
it's partially improv.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.870
[shouting]

07:30.870 --> 07:33.570
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

07:33.570 --> 07:35.540
I want whatever she's on.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.180
Welcome, Connie.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.210
You girls ready to get
some hair on your tits?

07:44.210 --> 07:46.280
[cheers and applause]

07:46.280 --> 07:48.750
Now, girls, are you ready
to get physical?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.420
[cheers]

07:50.420 --> 07:54.660
Good, because the two queens
with the best moves win.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.160
Let's go.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.760
I don't know about you,

08:00.760 --> 08:03.530
but I'm ready
for some thigh workouts.

08:03.530 --> 08:05.840
[cheers]

08:05.840 --> 08:07.240
Let's do it.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.370
Now, feel it working
through your cleavage.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.040
That way
you don't have to contour

08:13.040 --> 08:14.810
and you can save on makeup.

08:14.810 --> 08:16.380
All right, step it out.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.080
And lunge, lunge, lunge.

08:19.080 --> 08:23.120
Keep it going. [coughs]

08:23.120 --> 08:25.250
-[laughs]
-Keep going.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.160
I didn't say stop.
Oh, my God.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.430
Who wants a solo?

08:29.430 --> 08:31.190
-Jean jacket, I love you.
-Yes, I love you.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.800
Oh, my God, you make me feel
feminine with that beard.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.470
[all laugh]

08:39.270 --> 08:42.000
Let's Nomi Malone it.
Hup, hup, hup.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.310
It's all you.

08:43.310 --> 08:46.710
[Yvie]
I just love watching Scarlet

08:46.710 --> 08:48.210
get an opportunity to dance.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.210
It's so ridiculous.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.580
[laughs]
-Oh!

08:52.580 --> 08:55.380
Bluebird, are you
gonna be all right?

08:55.380 --> 08:56.690
I don't want you
to get any black eyes.

08:56.690 --> 08:58.790
I wanna see long legs.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.920
Whoa! Oh, my God! Whoa!

09:01.920 --> 09:03.530
Yeah!

09:03.530 --> 09:05.260
It's Pinky Tuscadero.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.260
[all laugh]

09:07.260 --> 09:10.730
And hit it.
It's kick, kick.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.370
Up to the glory of God.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.370
Hey, Jesus. Again.

09:14.370 --> 09:17.670
Hup, hup. This bitch
is trying outkick me.

09:17.670 --> 09:20.010
I quit, I quit.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.180
Last place.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.950
I smell something burning.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.210
It must be Plastique.

09:24.210 --> 09:25.980
Come on down, girl.

09:25.980 --> 09:27.920
Whoo. Get it.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.720
Oh, my God! Wow!

09:30.720 --> 09:33.490
I didn't need those
anyway, honey.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.490
Oh, my God.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.230
Oh, my Lord.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.490
Whoo! Let's curl.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.500
That's not gonna make me
look masculine, right?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.660
No, but your face will.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.270
[Vanjie] Ow!

09:44.270 --> 09:47.170
Whoa! Oh, my God!

09:49.910 --> 09:52.480
Let's do checkerboard, yes.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.080
I am not being racist.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.280
Hey, girl.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.250
Whoo! Wow!

09:57.250 --> 10:00.050
We're gonna jump out
and thrust, thrust.

10:00.050 --> 10:02.890
Out, and thrust, thrust. Out.

10:02.890 --> 10:05.620
Give me a limp wrist.
I need it gayer.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.990
All original.
Come on, let's do it.

10:07.990 --> 10:12.130
Hup and hup and hup
and hup and hup.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.500
Whoa!

10:19.740 --> 10:24.470
Hup and push. Now give it.
You're the last girl.

10:24.470 --> 10:27.310
Take it, girl.
You can still win this.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.880
You can still win it.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.510
I want a winner.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.350
Get it! Get it!

10:33.350 --> 10:35.320
Yes!
[slap]

10:35.320 --> 10:36.650
[laughs]

10:36.650 --> 10:38.750
That'll get ya.
I needed that.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.960
I needed it.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.130
All right, everybody,
let's rock it out.

10:57.710 --> 10:59.640
[RuPaul] Y'all worked that body.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.840
[cheers]

11:00.840 --> 11:04.910
But two of you really
made me feel the burn,

11:04.910 --> 11:07.650
and I've got an ointment
that will knock that right out.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.090
Connie, would you do the honors?

11:10.090 --> 11:11.490
I would love to.

11:11.490 --> 11:15.160
The two winners of
this workout challenge are...

11:16.290 --> 11:18.160
A'Keria.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.060
And oh, my God, Plastique.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.960
[cheers and applause]

11:21.960 --> 11:25.200
[A'Keria] ♪ Do-do-do-do ♪
I finally won something.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.870
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

11:26.870 --> 11:30.440
You've each won
a $1.500 gift card

11:30.440 --> 11:33.740
from MuLondon
organic skin care.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.380
[cheers and applause]

11:36.380 --> 11:37.880
Thank you, Connie, darling.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.620
You can leave
the way you came in.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.820
As they say in Hollywood,
I think I will.

11:43.820 --> 11:47.320
[laughter and applause]

11:52.930 --> 11:54.630
Ladies, I hope
you're all warmed up,

11:54.630 --> 11:57.000
because for this week's
Maxi Challenge,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.940
you'll be competing
in the first ever

11:59.940 --> 12:02.470
International Draglympics.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.270
[cheers and applause]

12:04.270 --> 12:07.580
[RuPaul] And you'll be doing it
in front of a live audience.

12:07.580 --> 12:08.880
[gasps]

12:08.880 --> 12:12.580
You'll be performing
a freestyle floor program

12:12.580 --> 12:16.350
that includes
compulsory fanography.

12:16.350 --> 12:17.990
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

12:17.990 --> 12:21.120
Voguing.
[cheers]

12:21.120 --> 12:23.860
And shablam.

12:23.860 --> 12:26.700
No, baby,
the AARP don't cover that.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.960
[all laugh]

12:27.960 --> 12:31.930
Now, you'll be competing
in two teams of five.

12:31.930 --> 12:34.840
A'Keria and Plastique,
you won the Mini Challenge,

12:34.840 --> 12:37.970
so you are the team leaders.

12:37.970 --> 12:39.980
A'Keria, you go first.

12:39.980 --> 12:42.780
I'm gonna go
with Brooke Lynn Hytes.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.880
Thank you.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.420
[applause]

12:46.420 --> 12:48.250
-Plastique.
-Ra'Jah O'Hara.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.220
Ayy.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.450
Silky Ganache.

12:51.450 --> 12:53.390
[all laugh]

12:53.390 --> 12:57.230
Miss Vanjie. Miss Van--
Ahhh!

12:57.230 --> 12:58.660
[all laugh]

12:58.660 --> 13:00.300
Yvie.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.900
Thank God.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.570
-Nina West.
-Yay.

13:05.570 --> 13:08.870
That leaves Scarlet Envy
and Shuga Cain.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.540
Give me some of that Shuga.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.010
Yay.

13:12.010 --> 13:16.650
And that means Scarlet Envy,
you are Team Plastique.

13:16.650 --> 13:18.480
Yes.
[applause]

13:18.480 --> 13:21.150
Errr! Put the brakes on,

13:21.150 --> 13:23.850
because Scarlet is on our team,
and we are in trouble.

13:23.850 --> 13:26.490
S.O.S. She's not a dancer.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.890
Help.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.590
Now, ladies, the Draglympics
are an international event.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.600
Very prestigious.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.230
Did I say puss-tigious?

13:35.230 --> 13:36.400
[all laugh]

13:36.400 --> 13:38.530
Very puss-tigious.

13:38.530 --> 13:40.640
[all laugh]

13:40.640 --> 13:43.470
So Team A'Keria,
you'll be representing

13:43.470 --> 13:46.840
the sovereign nation
of Tuckpantistan.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.840
Ooh.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.680
And Team Plastique,
you'll be representing

13:51.680 --> 13:54.480
the People's Republic
of Glamazonia.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.890
Nice.

13:56.890 --> 13:58.150
And you'll be coached

13:58.150 --> 14:02.560
by Emmy Award-winning
choreographer Travis Wall.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.090
-Yes!
-[gasps]

14:04.090 --> 14:08.230
And U.S. Olympic
figure skating champion

14:08.230 --> 14:09.700
Adam Rippon.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.100
[cheers and applause]

14:12.100 --> 14:15.770
Gentlemen of the world,
start your engines,

14:15.770 --> 14:18.470
and may the best woman win.

14:18.470 --> 14:19.810
[cheers and applause]

14:19.810 --> 14:21.280
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.440
I'm worried.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.510
There's too many iffies
in this group.

14:24.510 --> 14:25.580
We got Scarlet.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.020
We got Nina.
She ain't a dancer.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.750
She ain't solid gold,
and this ain't comedy.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.490
Ra'Jah, temperamental.

14:32.490 --> 14:34.620
This ain't America's
best dance crew right here.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.260
We can't even make
the auditions.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.990
We are fucked.

14:38.990 --> 14:42.060
[Vanjie] Lead us to victory.
Win this Olympic medal, bitch.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.070
-We're taking the gold home.
-Yes.

14:44.070 --> 14:45.630
For this week's Maxi Challenge,

14:45.630 --> 14:48.100
we have to perform
in the Draglympics.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.170
[Plastique] This challenge
is super physical,

14:50.170 --> 14:51.970
but I'm so excited for it

14:51.970 --> 14:52.980
because I can
buck the house down.

14:52.980 --> 14:55.710
Gakita, gakita, ga-ga-ga.

14:55.710 --> 14:58.410
When Ru said choreographer,
I was like, wait, oh, no, bitch.

14:58.410 --> 15:00.980
Not again.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.690
-Up, one, two--
-Oh, I'm sorry.

15:03.690 --> 15:04.750
Ra'Jah,
you shouldn't have told me

15:04.750 --> 15:08.190
you had this dance
experience, mama.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.060
I'm going back into
my Kameron Michaels shell.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.060
I have never seen
a dance floor at all.

15:12.060 --> 15:13.630
-I've never done nothing.
-Right.

15:13.630 --> 15:15.600
I am the Tee
when it comes to dancing,

15:15.600 --> 15:18.000
but after working with
the other choreographer,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I really don't know
what to expect.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.040
Oh!

15:20.040 --> 15:21.440
I'm shook.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.270
[Scarlet] I'm just a little
nervous for myself.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.370
We all know I can't dance.

15:25.370 --> 15:26.740
I mean, I haven't done
a lot of death drops,

15:26.740 --> 15:28.940
but if I don't do it well
but I do it,

15:28.940 --> 15:31.880
and they know how out
of that comfort zone it is,

15:31.880 --> 15:34.380
I think that might
speak for itself?

15:34.380 --> 15:36.690
No, because if you
still do a death drop

15:36.690 --> 15:38.190
and you don't do it well,

15:38.190 --> 15:39.720
I think they're going to be
like, what the hell was that?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.460
-I was the last picked.
-One, two, three, four.

15:43.460 --> 15:46.300
And I can tell that none of them
wanted me on the team.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.260
Out. Out?

15:48.500 --> 15:50.230
So that's a hard place
to start from.

15:50.230 --> 15:53.970
Help, literally, help.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.410
I did choose my team
for a reason.

15:56.410 --> 15:57.810
I wanted to pick people

15:57.810 --> 16:00.310
who I know actually
can pick up choreography.

16:00.310 --> 16:03.450
And even if you can't, you know
how to make it look good.

16:03.450 --> 16:04.810
[Brooke Lynn]
My team is feeling really good

16:04.810 --> 16:06.950
going into
the Draglympics challenge,

16:06.950 --> 16:08.780
but I'm a little worried

16:08.780 --> 16:11.620
about the drama
between Yvie and Silky.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.560
Now, are you two going to
be okay working together,

16:13.560 --> 16:14.890
because we got a little heated
this morning.

16:16.290 --> 16:19.360
We have to address this issue.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.430
Because at this point in time,
we are a team,

16:21.430 --> 16:24.430
and we're all on a mission.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.000
I can put all
my personal things aside.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.110
Like this is work for me,
so like, I'm coming into work.

16:31.110 --> 16:32.570
Okay. I just wanted to check.
We're not gonna have any--

16:32.570 --> 16:33.980
[A'Keria]
Yeah, because it's five of us,

16:33.980 --> 16:36.140
and I think everybody's aim

16:36.140 --> 16:38.450
is they're trying to be their
number one or their top three,

16:38.450 --> 16:41.280
because that's what's
gonna get us through this.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.890
Look, I don't want
any drama going forth.

16:43.890 --> 16:45.220
Like, I don't have time
for the B.S.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.790
We trying to win.

16:46.790 --> 16:49.120
Now, if y'all wanna slice
each other's throat afterward,

16:49.120 --> 16:51.090
by all means.

16:51.090 --> 16:54.100
But as of right now, we're
not finna have none of that.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.200
So do anybody have
any special skills?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.100
-I mean--
-Ballet.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.370
Yeah, I know
you have your baton.

17:00.370 --> 17:03.210
That could be incorporated
into some type of hand motion.

17:03.210 --> 17:06.010
-I got a trick or two.
-Yeah, you do?

17:06.010 --> 17:07.210
She a bendy girl.

17:07.210 --> 17:09.040
[Yvie] Any given
performance of mine,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.880
you can expect me
to be flying from the ceiling,

17:11.880 --> 17:15.980
hanging off of something,
contorting into boxes.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.550
I was born super flexible

17:17.550 --> 17:19.790
because I don't produce
a whole lot of collagen,

17:19.790 --> 17:22.490
so my joints go every which way.

17:22.490 --> 17:24.660
[A'Keria] Do you think that
you could teach somebody

17:24.660 --> 17:26.830
who, you know,
ain't as nimble as you--

17:26.830 --> 17:27.830
[Yvie] Yeah, the shablam?

17:27.830 --> 17:29.260
-[A'Keria] Yeah, that.
-Yeah.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.670
The shablam is what
you're supposed to do,

17:30.670 --> 17:32.470
which is supposed to be
kind of like a surprise.

17:32.470 --> 17:35.140
So it should come out
of like a twirl,

17:35.140 --> 17:36.670
and then you just
bend your knee down,

17:36.670 --> 17:40.280
and you find your way
to the floor and point.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.440
[Brooke Lynn]
Show me how to do that.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.150
I'm very ballerina,

17:43.150 --> 17:46.480
so I don't really like just
throw myself into things.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.880
Like death drops terrify me.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.080
Which way do you go
when you turn?

17:49.080 --> 17:51.590
When I turn,
I turn to the outside.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.590
So you go bam, bam, bam.

17:53.590 --> 17:56.290
And then whatever leg
you are going to be falling on

17:56.290 --> 17:58.090
is the leg
you should be spinning on.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.360
I could do that.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.560
[Yvie] Yeah, girl.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.700
Oh, no, I'm not doing it
on that concrete, baby.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.670
Y'all keep the concrete
right now.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.870
I am not a dancer,

18:06.870 --> 18:09.740
but I have a team
full of dancers,

18:09.740 --> 18:11.410
and now I have to lead them
to victory.

18:11.410 --> 18:14.980
My goal is to show those judges
that I can be a leader.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.150
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:18.150 --> 18:20.620
[Yvie] It's time to rehearse
our choreography

18:20.620 --> 18:22.450
for the Draglympics.

18:22.450 --> 18:23.890
Not only do we have an Olympian,

18:23.890 --> 18:27.490
but we have an Emmy
Award-winning choreographer.

18:27.490 --> 18:28.990
I'm feeling so solid.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.560
[Travis] Yes.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.890
We're stealing that move today.

18:32.890 --> 18:35.330
I'm here to give you a show,
so you want a good show?

18:35.330 --> 18:36.870
I'm gonna come find you, yes.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.130
No, you found me.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.470
[all laugh]

18:39.470 --> 18:40.570
I'm ready.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.000
[Travis]
This is the Draglympics.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.940
There's three
compulsory elements in this,

18:43.940 --> 18:45.610
so we have to all
dance with fans,

18:45.610 --> 18:47.210
and then we all have to vogue,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.580
and then we all have to have
some version of a shablam.

18:49.580 --> 18:53.050
Whatever the dance is,
you guys need to sell it.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.980
It's a performance.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.180
[Travis] So we're going
to start teaching you

18:56.180 --> 18:57.690
a little bit
of the fanography first.

18:57.690 --> 18:59.590
Please come grab a Daftboy fan.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.560
You're going to take the fan,
one, point, two.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.200
Three. You're going
to open your fan on four.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.070
Five, six, you're going
to turn and close the fan.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.840
And then you're going to open it

19:14.840 --> 19:16.240
and do arched back on eight.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.510
One fan down.
Here we go.

19:18.510 --> 19:20.640
Boom, two, three, four.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.010
Five, six, seven, back.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.510
-How'd you do?
-Great.

19:24.510 --> 19:25.650
Slapped myself.

19:25.650 --> 19:26.680
A'Keria, would you do it
by yourself?

19:26.680 --> 19:27.680
Yeah, I sure can try it.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.720
Five, six, seven, and...

19:29.720 --> 19:31.650
-Step, cross, three.
-One, two.

19:31.650 --> 19:34.960
Then keep going.
One, two, three, four.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.430
-Now fan on four.
-Okay, fan on four.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.830
[Travis] That was almost it,
yeah.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.490
Now, I can pop a fan
all day long.

19:39.490 --> 19:42.560
But to pop a fan
and remember to move this way

19:42.560 --> 19:45.530
and step with this foot
and then do this hand...

19:47.640 --> 19:48.870
Don't get in your head.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.940
Just like, relax,
and even if you do mess up,

19:51.940 --> 19:53.910
don't make
any sort of like facial.

19:53.910 --> 19:55.780
-Right.
-If you give like a facial,

19:55.780 --> 19:58.080
everybody's gonna know
when you're like uh-uh-uh.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.920
[Travis] All right,
so let's learn

19:59.920 --> 20:01.420
some of the voguing section.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.420
Touch and a release.
Touch and release.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.490
So, bitch,
get out of my way, ha.

20:06.490 --> 20:08.820
Think about touch this skin,
darling.

20:08.820 --> 20:09.860
Brooke Lynn, can you do it once?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.060
-Sure.
-Five, six, sell it, great.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.030
One and a two,
three and a four,

20:14.030 --> 20:15.730
and a right and a left
and a right and a left.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.000
And a circle to the back,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.600
circle to the hip,
step and pull, step and pull.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.400
Brooke Lynn, that looks so good.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.070
-It's sick.
-Thank you.

20:23.070 --> 20:25.240
Everyone has to come up to
your level, but it looks good.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.010
My eye's gonna be on Brooke Lynn
to see what she can deliver,

20:29.010 --> 20:31.110
because we're expecting a lot.

20:31.110 --> 20:33.720
From there, you're going
to go one, snap, two.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.180
Three, snap, four.
Five, snap, six.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.950
Now, seven and an eight, and ha.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.490
You're going take it
all the way to the floor.

20:39.490 --> 20:40.590
[A'Keria] I need help.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.620
So, listen,
this is not a death drop.

20:42.620 --> 20:46.500
The idea is it's a smooth
transition to the floor.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.900
Travis is telling me
to go down graceful.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.270
It's like a whoo.

20:50.270 --> 20:51.370
Bitch, there's no graceful.

20:51.370 --> 20:52.700
There's a pam!

20:52.700 --> 20:54.370
Or you won't get nothing,
honey.

20:54.370 --> 20:57.870
Silky, here we go.
Five, six, seven, and.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.940
Go step, ha, ah, mm, ah.

21:00.940 --> 21:02.580
Circle to the back.

21:02.580 --> 21:06.480
Yeah, girl.
[cheers and applause]

21:06.480 --> 21:07.580
So everyone get to the floor.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.280
We're gonna do a little
five and six

21:09.280 --> 21:10.450
to cross your legs,

21:10.450 --> 21:11.690
Then you're going
to whip around.

21:11.690 --> 21:13.590
Seven, eight,
to the right knee down,

21:13.590 --> 21:15.660
and then you're going
to pull up on one.

21:15.660 --> 21:16.890
Let me see it from the floor.

21:16.890 --> 21:20.100
Boom, ha, ha, seven,
and back one.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.630
Come up, flick, flick,
down, through, and go.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.170
Not bad. Maybe
this becomes your solo,

21:26.170 --> 21:28.140
and they get up on one,
and then we all come around you.

21:28.140 --> 21:29.400
-Uh-huh, I'm gonna get up.
-Okay.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.410
-Imma get it.
-Yes, you are.

21:31.410 --> 21:33.810
I'm a big bitch, but
I ain't not scared big bitch.

21:33.810 --> 21:37.250
Here we go, back on one.
Six, seven, eight.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.020
Back one, two, come up,
three, four.

21:40.020 --> 21:43.450
Go flick, flick, down,
through, drop, come up.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.120
That was a disaster.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.590
Let's do that one more time.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.260
Silky's flopping around
on the floor

21:48.260 --> 21:51.360
looking like
The Greatest Catch. [laughs]

21:51.360 --> 21:53.500
The thing about Silky
is she fucking works it.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.530
She's like, yeah, I look crazy,
but I'm doing it.

21:56.530 --> 21:58.400
And the bitch is committed.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.300
I feel like
a skinny bitch today.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.700
[Brooke Lynn]
Maybe you will be by tomorrow.

22:05.340 --> 22:06.840
[all laugh]

22:06.840 --> 22:09.380
Silky, she's gonna
have to work really hard

22:09.380 --> 22:10.910
to keep up with everybody else
in her group,

22:10.910 --> 22:14.120
but that personality alone,
she's explosive.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.020
And I think that
she's going to do

22:16.020 --> 22:17.220
really well
in this challenge.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.450
One more time to the floor.

22:18.450 --> 22:22.020
Come up, flick, flick,
down, through, and go.

22:22.020 --> 22:24.160
Not bad.
Yvie, you okay?

22:24.160 --> 22:29.130
I'm going to have to cheat
specifically the turn today.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.670
Tomorrow I can do death drops,
splits, kicks, everything.

22:31.670 --> 22:35.870
[Yvie] During rehearsals,
I'm a little bit rattled

22:35.870 --> 22:38.770
by the fact that
all of my joints are hurting.

22:38.770 --> 22:42.710
But I'm just gonna have
to grind through it.

22:42.710 --> 22:43.710
Thank you, guys,
for your hard work.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.850
I really appreciate it.

22:44.850 --> 22:46.750
I want to push you guys
as far as possible,

22:46.750 --> 22:48.020
so there's a lot to do.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.350
I'm just so thankful

22:49.350 --> 22:51.590
that all of you guys
have some rhythm in you.

22:51.590 --> 22:54.790
Some seasons, it's like,
oh, it's like Bambi and...

22:54.790 --> 22:56.160
Bitch, you gonna hate
the next team.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.290
Oh, you gonna be angry.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.830
[all laugh]

23:00.830 --> 23:02.430
Yvie, can I talk to you
for a second?

23:02.430 --> 23:03.570
-Yeah.
-Cool.

23:03.570 --> 23:06.000
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.400
It's just I want to give myself
one more day to rest, though.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.570
What happened to it?

23:09.570 --> 23:10.670
Like was it just from
the last challenge or...

23:10.670 --> 23:13.410
Yeah, it was just
from the last challenge,

23:13.410 --> 23:15.940
I was standing in heels
for all day.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.110
Okay. I don't want to, like,
take it to the next level

23:18.110 --> 23:19.610
where you're not going
to be part of the competition.

23:19.610 --> 23:22.780
[Yvie] Because of my condition,

23:22.780 --> 23:27.160
I know that I shouldn't be doing
all of my contortions right now.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.960
I just would
rather not bring it up,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.590
because I don't want
to be babied.

23:32.590 --> 23:35.260
Just make sure, like,
stay as honest as possible,

23:35.260 --> 23:36.400
and then we're going
to get through this.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
-All right.
-Awesome.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.770
-Thank you so much.
-Take care.

23:38.770 --> 23:41.800
[Yvie] I'm frustrated
having to hold myself back

23:41.800 --> 23:44.140
because I didn't come here
to play safe.

23:44.140 --> 23:46.010
Safe gets you sent home.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.680
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.710
-Hey.
-There go the boys.

23:52.710 --> 23:54.820
This challenge in particular
I'm excited for

23:54.820 --> 23:56.180
because I started out
my drag career

23:56.180 --> 23:58.620
in backup dancing
for all those chickenheads.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.560
Like I'm excited, and I feel
like I can do good with this.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.920
At this point,
I know I have to stand out,

24:02.920 --> 24:04.190
'cause I want to win something.

24:04.190 --> 24:05.290
What we're going to do first

24:05.290 --> 24:06.930
is we're going
to work on the voguing.

24:06.930 --> 24:09.830
So let's learn these hands.
This is going to be fun.

24:09.830 --> 24:11.470
Up and out, up and out,

24:11.470 --> 24:13.440
and a voom, badda-ba,
badda-boom, badda-ba.

24:13.440 --> 24:17.870
Five, six, seven,
and up and out, up and out.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.110
And an up and a down,
and an up and a down.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.140
Nice. I just want more body.

24:23.140 --> 24:25.350
Ra'Jah, one more time.
Five, six, seven.

24:25.350 --> 24:28.280
And up and an out,
up and an out,

24:28.280 --> 24:30.190
and a boom, tadda-ba,
badda-boom, badda-ba.

24:30.190 --> 24:32.490
And a hip and a hip,
and a step and a back.

24:32.490 --> 24:35.220
Five, six, seven, and boom.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.830
[cheers]
[Scarlet] Good work.

24:37.830 --> 24:41.000
That's really great
comparatively to everybody else.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.260
But I still want you
to push yourself further.

24:42.260 --> 24:44.370
-Okay.
-Vanjie, can you show me?

24:44.370 --> 24:47.500
Five, six, boom-tadda-da,
boom-tadda-da.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.540
And an up and a down
and an up and a down.

24:49.540 --> 24:51.840
And a boom, boom,
step, ha.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.310
Five, six, seven, and ha.
Amazing.

24:55.310 --> 24:56.480
I have no notes.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.480
I'm coming for you, Ra'Jah.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.020
[all laugh]

25:00.020 --> 25:01.820
Next up we're going
to work on the fanography,

25:01.820 --> 25:03.950
so please come grab a fan.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.520
Guess who's back in the house.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.020
[pop, pop]

25:07.020 --> 25:10.130
Five, six, seven, ha.

25:10.130 --> 25:11.590
You're going to step across.

25:11.590 --> 25:14.900
One, you're going to pull
the fan across on two,

25:14.900 --> 25:18.930
then you're going to step three,
you're going to swipe on four.

25:18.930 --> 25:22.170
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, jump, eight.

25:22.170 --> 25:25.170
Step past eight,
step to the out.

25:25.170 --> 25:29.510
Step across.
Feet, feet, a knock-knock, go.

25:29.510 --> 25:31.780
Know exactly
what the fan is doing.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.050
Your execution score
is going to up or down

25:34.050 --> 25:36.580
dependent on what these fans
are doing.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.920
-Scarlet.
-Oh, God.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.860
Ready? Here we go.
Seven, jump, eight.

25:40.860 --> 25:43.530
One and two, three and four.

25:43.530 --> 25:48.160
Five and six, seven, eight,
one and two.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.300
Let's try it again.
It's like, snap.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.570
Give me that.
Just do that part.

25:51.570 --> 25:53.670
On two. One, hop.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.940
I just want to see this.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.410
One, hop.

25:57.410 --> 25:58.840
Act like you're in drag, girls.
It's a snap.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.770
Give me something there.

26:01.510 --> 26:03.380
-It was not very good.
-No.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.750
-But we're gonna get there.
-Okay.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.180
Scarlet
is definitely the weakest.

26:07.180 --> 26:09.780
However, why do I feel
like she's gonna, like,

26:09.780 --> 26:12.520
come forward tomorrow
and like win the challenge?

26:12.520 --> 26:15.220
One and two, three and four.
You lost it.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.230
Let's try again.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.830
Of course we still have
the struggle bus with Scarlet.

26:19.830 --> 26:20.830
[Travis] And up.

26:20.830 --> 26:21.830
In the way.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.900
[Ra'Jah] Bitch, could you find
your spot so I can get in mine?

26:25.900 --> 26:28.470
Thank you. Move, bitch.

26:28.470 --> 26:30.240
Here we go.
This is our last time.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.810
Then we gotta wrap it up.
Here we go.

26:31.810 --> 26:33.780
Five, six, seven, go.

26:33.780 --> 26:37.180
In, up, out, down, hit,
through, oh, my God.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.010
I thought someone
was going to get it.

26:39.010 --> 26:40.820
No one did, though.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.450
All I know is
I'm looking at Travis's face,

26:43.450 --> 26:45.990
and he looks like he just saw
Michael Jackson's ghost.

26:45.990 --> 26:47.260
Out of the two groups,

26:47.260 --> 26:49.920
you guys did have a harder time
picking up choreography,

26:49.920 --> 26:51.830
but you have to get those steps.

26:51.830 --> 26:54.260
Those steps are part of
your compulsory elements.

26:54.260 --> 26:56.400
This is becoming a disaster.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.270
I'm praying that
these girls get hit

26:59.270 --> 27:00.840
by the Rhythm Nation stick.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.270
This was my chance
to do something good.

27:03.270 --> 27:05.010
Like what did I do
to deserve this?

27:09.440 --> 27:12.450
-Silky, why you fart?
-Did you fart?

27:12.450 --> 27:14.780
You farted.
Yes, you did, bitch.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.020
You nasty bitch.

27:16.020 --> 27:19.150
Today is the Draglympics.

27:19.150 --> 27:24.130
We got to do fanography,
vogueography, and shablam.

27:24.130 --> 27:27.430
Oh, get my wig, girl,
get my wig!

27:27.430 --> 27:28.700
[Ra'Jah]
Come on twerk.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.670
-Come on, pancake.
-[Silky]I'm coming in.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.000
Come on, pancake.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.900
[Vanjie] This why
I love y'all nasty ho's.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.600
They got an ass
but I got a stomach.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.210
[all laugh]

27:38.210 --> 27:39.370
[Vanjie]
Oh, Lord, Jesus.

27:39.370 --> 27:41.110
How do you feel
about your team, bitch?

27:41.110 --> 27:46.010
Girl, you know some of us
are not as strong dancers,

27:46.010 --> 27:48.820
but I have to make sure
I'm doing my part.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.490
You know my theory.
You got it,

27:50.490 --> 27:52.690
or lip sync for your
motherfucking life.

27:52.690 --> 27:54.290
Yeah.

27:54.290 --> 27:56.220
[Vanjie] It's important for
me to do well in this challenge

27:56.220 --> 27:57.560
because I've been close,

27:57.560 --> 28:00.530
but I haven't been able
to like hit the home runs.

28:00.530 --> 28:01.930
[Silky]
I can't wait to see

28:01.930 --> 28:03.360
what you're going to wear
on this runway, bitch.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.370
[Vanjie]
Sometimes I don't think

28:04.370 --> 28:05.570
my runways go over that well,

28:05.570 --> 28:07.640
So I need to make sure
I at least sell it

28:07.640 --> 28:09.600
and am confident on the runway.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.410
I want to do it,
one, for Mama Ru,

28:11.410 --> 28:12.740
because, you know,
she brought me back,

28:12.740 --> 28:15.010
and I feel like I been
letting her down a little bit.

28:16.810 --> 28:17.710
Uh-uh.

28:25.490 --> 28:27.390
Just like, lately,

28:27.390 --> 28:29.290
I've been feeling like
I haven't been improving,

28:29.290 --> 28:32.260
like, girl, we're like halfway
through the competition,

28:32.260 --> 28:33.560
I haven't even won
a Mini Challenge.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.100
I feel like
it's a lot of expectations

28:36.100 --> 28:38.770
from like a lot of people.

28:38.770 --> 28:42.200
I don't...like, I feel like
I should be doing better.

28:44.440 --> 28:48.080
So it frustrates me
because I know what I can do.

28:48.080 --> 28:52.650
And I feel like I just have
been like kind of scared.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.950
Like I'm like, bitch,
I need to do something,

28:55.950 --> 28:58.920
because I want people to know
that I'm not like here

28:58.920 --> 29:00.690
just to kiki and hang out
you know.

29:00.690 --> 29:02.220
We all came to do--

29:02.220 --> 29:04.660
-A job.
-To perform our best, yeah.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.230
Trust me, you're doing just
what you're supposed to do,

29:07.230 --> 29:09.360
which is each day
handle each challenge

29:09.360 --> 29:12.070
the way you're supposed to,
and continue to fight in this.

29:12.070 --> 29:13.130
Yeah.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.440
[Vanjie] I'm frustrated
with myself

29:14.440 --> 29:17.640
because I know
what Yvie said was true.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.140
Like I need to step it up,
because I've been safe.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.580
Brooke Lynn, babe,
how did you get started in drag?

29:27.580 --> 29:31.290
I started doing drag
professionally when I was 25.

29:31.290 --> 29:32.750
And I moved to New York,

29:32.750 --> 29:34.520
and I danced
with Ballet Trockadero.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.260
Oh, yes. I have some friends
in Trockadero.

29:37.260 --> 29:39.560
[Brooke Lynn] Ballet Trockadero
de Monte Carlo,

29:39.560 --> 29:42.360
it's an all-male ballet company,
and they do drag.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.670
So I got to be a ballerina for
four years and travel the world.

29:45.670 --> 29:48.700
I performed for royalty,
performed for Karl Lagerfeld,

29:48.700 --> 29:50.670
Princess Caroline of Monaco.

29:50.670 --> 29:54.180
So that was a life-changing
experience for me.

29:54.180 --> 29:55.680
I danced there for four years.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.750
So fierce.
I love that.

30:00.780 --> 30:02.050
[Shuga]
So how you feeling, girl?

30:02.050 --> 30:05.520
I know your body was kind of
messing with you today.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.790
Honestly,
I have this joint disorder

30:08.790 --> 30:12.360
that gives me all of these
crazy flexible abilities.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.830
But it's a double-edged sword

30:13.830 --> 30:15.860
because some days I wake up

30:15.860 --> 30:20.000
and I can just feel my bones,
like, sliding apart.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.940
Oh, shit.

30:21.940 --> 30:25.270
And that's how I felt
the day we got this challenge.

30:25.270 --> 30:28.280
I felt my body being like, girl,
today is not the day.

30:29.610 --> 30:32.880
[Yvie] Growing up,
my bones were always hurting

30:32.880 --> 30:34.980
to an unnecessary amount.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.850
We thought it was
growing pains.

30:37.850 --> 30:41.320
I remember being like 13 or 14

30:41.320 --> 30:44.160
when I finally got,
like, the full diagnosis

30:44.160 --> 30:46.690
of what exactly
is going on with my body.

30:46.690 --> 30:47.730
[Nina]
What is it called?

30:47.730 --> 30:49.900
It's called Ehlers-Danlos.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.470
Oh, wow.

30:51.470 --> 30:53.700
And it's just, my body
doesn't produce enough collagen,

30:53.700 --> 30:56.070
which is why
I've got all of these

30:56.070 --> 30:58.570
and all of this at 24.

30:58.570 --> 30:59.770
[Nina] Really?

30:59.770 --> 31:02.180
My condition is something
that is eventually

31:02.180 --> 31:06.450
going to take me out
of drag commission,

31:06.450 --> 31:09.480
at least in the way
that I'm doing it now.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.520
Is it not curable?
Is that what it--

31:11.520 --> 31:13.490
It just gets worse and worse
over time.

31:13.490 --> 31:16.320
I met somebody who has
the same disease as me

31:16.320 --> 31:17.390
and is 10 years older.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.630
They're in a wheelchair.

31:18.630 --> 31:20.860
-They have heart complications.
-Are you serious?

31:20.860 --> 31:24.330
So I get to like--I get like
a little vision of my future.

31:24.330 --> 31:27.840
Mama, I'm so sorry.
That's so wild.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.500
[Yvie] That's why every year
I've auditioned for Drag Race.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.540
I was like, I have
to get on this year.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.840
I have to do it,
because I'm like,

31:32.840 --> 31:36.010
I'm losing my skills as I go on.

31:36.010 --> 31:37.750
Does it bother you,
like, a lot of the time?

31:37.750 --> 31:39.580
It's always kind of there.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.520
Like, I'm literally
always in pain.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.420
It's just
it's not always at a 10.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.520
It's usually at
like a four or five.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.020
Even though drag is something

31:48.020 --> 31:49.520
that's been really hard
on my body,

31:49.520 --> 31:50.630
and it's definitely something

31:50.630 --> 31:53.630
I'm not going to be able
to do forever,

31:53.630 --> 31:55.900
it's so liberating

31:55.900 --> 31:58.700
that if I have to go
out on stage in a wheelchair,

31:58.700 --> 31:59.770
girl, like, I'll do it.

32:02.340 --> 32:05.740
She has all this pain,
but have you seen the bitch?

32:05.740 --> 32:08.980
She acts like nothing is wrong.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.980
You never know
what someone's going through.

32:10.980 --> 32:13.980
So for those of us who don't
have weird joint disorders,

32:13.980 --> 32:15.420
how are your bodies feeling?

48:42.670 --> 48:43.900
and I just think
you need to like

48:43.900 --> 48:45.710
turn up that knob
as much as possible.

48:45.710 --> 48:47.410
[Michelle]
Keep going where you're going

48:47.410 --> 48:49.140
and push yourself
to get there quicker,

48:49.140 --> 48:51.750
because tick tock,
you don't stop.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.310
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

48:53.310 --> 48:54.680
[Michelle]
Tonight on the runway,

48:54.680 --> 48:57.150
I think you look really fun.

48:57.150 --> 48:59.850
I'm not always a fan
of something covering the face,

48:59.850 --> 49:02.060
but it's see-through enough
that we can see your expression.

49:02.060 --> 49:05.130
[Adam] Performance-wise,
you still need to take it up.

49:05.130 --> 49:06.960
[Travis]
Yesterday, I felt like

49:06.960 --> 49:09.760
you had some of the most tools
in your box

49:09.760 --> 49:11.400
compared to
the rest of your team.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.170
Today, I felt that you were
just slightly unmemorable.

49:15.170 --> 49:16.570
You're an amazing dancer.

49:16.570 --> 49:18.000
I think you just need
to embody all of that

49:18.000 --> 49:18.940
and deliver it forward.

49:20.870 --> 49:23.640
Hearing that from you
kind of means the world to me,

49:23.640 --> 49:27.080
because a couple weeks back...
[laughs]

49:27.080 --> 49:30.280
I had a situation
with another choreographer

49:30.280 --> 49:31.990
that really just tore me down.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.490
Whew.

49:34.490 --> 49:35.520
[Mirai] You know,
you're competing

49:35.520 --> 49:37.320
against big personalities,

49:37.320 --> 49:40.330
and so, in future challenges,
instead of looking to the past

49:40.330 --> 49:43.860
and thinking on the negative,
just be you.

49:43.860 --> 49:47.670
[RuPaul] Up next, Vanjie.

49:47.670 --> 49:49.600
Your energy in rehearsal
was infectious.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.440
It definitely portrayed
onto the stage

49:51.440 --> 49:52.810
in the main challenge.

49:52.810 --> 49:55.310
You slayed
the performance 100%.

49:55.310 --> 49:57.010
Tonight on the runway,

49:57.010 --> 49:59.080
it's sort of like
Drag Race 101,

49:59.080 --> 50:02.150
where you shouldn't just
wear a leotard and tights.

50:02.150 --> 50:03.520
Do you know
what I'm going to say?

50:03.520 --> 50:04.990
I know. Sorry.

50:04.990 --> 50:06.550
[Michelle]
It's either a leotard

50:06.550 --> 50:08.590
or a corset and a panty
and some kind of pasty.

50:08.590 --> 50:10.020
-Right.
-And then glitter on the chest.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.120
I know what
you're going to be wearing

50:11.120 --> 50:12.460
when you come around the corner.

50:12.460 --> 50:13.860
I shouldn't be doing that,

50:13.860 --> 50:15.600
and I'm getting bored.

50:15.600 --> 50:18.300
[Mirai] So I get it.

50:18.300 --> 50:19.830
Like maybe put a dress on.

50:19.830 --> 50:22.340
But tonight, like,
I like the way you look.

50:22.340 --> 50:23.770
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

50:23.770 --> 50:26.770
[RuPaul] All right,
up next, Nina West.

50:26.770 --> 50:28.710
Even if you aren't
the best dancer up there,

50:28.710 --> 50:30.410
I didn't really give a shit.

50:30.410 --> 50:33.080
You were selling
every single moment.

50:33.080 --> 50:35.180
[Michelle] I could not take
my eyes off of you.

50:35.180 --> 50:36.820
You were enigmatic.

50:36.820 --> 50:38.490
[RuPaul] What did you call her?

50:38.490 --> 50:41.420
Sorry. I'm going to help you
with something now.

50:41.420 --> 50:43.260
-You're a big girl.
-I am.

50:43.260 --> 50:45.660
-And you have big shoulders.
-I do.

50:45.660 --> 50:47.630
-And a big kind of chest.
-Yeah.

50:47.630 --> 50:50.730
I think you need to focus more
padding on the bottom half

50:50.730 --> 50:53.100
to balance out the top half.

50:53.100 --> 50:57.070
It's just going to make
a more pleasing figure.

50:57.070 --> 50:58.970
Okay, absolutely.
I totally see that.

50:58.970 --> 51:01.140
Michelle is right. Maybe you
could put your tits on your ass.

51:01.140 --> 51:02.740
[all laugh]

51:04.180 --> 51:06.410
[RuPaul]
All right. Scarlet Envy.

51:06.410 --> 51:09.350
You were actually the one
that I really lost.

51:09.350 --> 51:12.590
You were like gone for me,
and I don't know why.

51:12.590 --> 51:13.990
I know what you can do
in a performance.

51:13.990 --> 51:15.790
I've directed you.

51:15.790 --> 51:17.420
Were you insecure
about the dancing?

51:17.420 --> 51:18.930
-Very.
-There we go.

51:18.930 --> 51:20.490
[Travis] Yesterday I felt like,
you know,

51:20.490 --> 51:22.400
it was hard for both of us.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.860
However, today,
you were the most improved.

51:24.860 --> 51:27.930
Were you the weakest at
retaining the choreography

51:27.930 --> 51:29.140
and the steps? Yes.

51:29.140 --> 51:31.300
Were you the weakest
at performance? No.

51:31.300 --> 51:33.540
[Michelle] And tonight
on the runway you look pretty,

51:33.540 --> 51:36.610
but it kind of
is not right for me.

51:36.610 --> 51:37.740
Think grand, baby.

51:37.740 --> 51:40.180
[Adam] The outfit
is a little bit basic.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.820
The earrings
going into the necklace,

51:42.820 --> 51:44.820
that one is gold and one is--

51:44.820 --> 51:45.820
-There you go.
-Take it off.

51:45.820 --> 51:47.090
-Gorgeous.
-Already better.

51:47.090 --> 51:48.820
It's already much better.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.990
It was just like
very hard for me this week.

51:50.990 --> 51:54.960
I feel like I've been
so incredibly confident

51:54.960 --> 51:56.760
through this process thus far,

51:56.760 --> 52:00.430
I think maybe it almost gets on
my sisters' nerves occasionally.

52:00.430 --> 52:02.940
And it just vanished.

52:06.340 --> 52:08.380
[RuPaul] Thank you, Scarlet.

52:08.380 --> 52:11.110
Ladies, I have a final question.

52:11.110 --> 52:12.780
Who should go home tonight...

52:15.080 --> 52:17.380
And why?

52:17.380 --> 52:19.920
Starting with Plastique Tiara.

52:23.620 --> 52:28.130
Just based on the critiques,
my sister Scarlet Envy.

52:28.130 --> 52:29.530
All right. Ra'Jah.

52:29.530 --> 52:31.200
If it were my choice,
I would send Scarlet.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.030
A lot of the times,
when I was losing my way--

52:34.030 --> 52:36.270
well, well, I won't blame her

52:36.270 --> 52:39.610
for some of the mistakes
that I made, but Scarlet.

52:39.610 --> 52:41.780
[Vanjie] I would have
to also say Scarlet,

52:41.780 --> 52:44.010
just based on
what has happened.

52:44.010 --> 52:45.210
Nina West.

52:45.210 --> 52:49.450
I would also say Scarlet.

52:49.450 --> 52:51.480
I will say this, though.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.550
Nobody has worked harder,

52:53.550 --> 52:56.520
so I think
that should be noted.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.430
Scarlet, who should go home
tonight?

53:03.300 --> 53:04.330
I can't say any of them.

53:06.230 --> 53:08.940
But I'm not going to say me.

53:08.940 --> 53:11.570
[RuPaul] So who should go home?

53:11.570 --> 53:15.080
I guess Ra'Jah's
been in the bottom

53:15.080 --> 53:18.080
a lot.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.680
Well, thank you, ladies,
for your honesty,

53:19.680 --> 53:20.950
and for your hard work.

53:20.950 --> 53:23.650
While you untuck backstage,

53:23.650 --> 53:25.750
the judges and I
will deliberate.

53:27.150 --> 53:29.560
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

53:29.560 --> 53:30.790
what do you think?

53:30.790 --> 53:34.330
Let's start
with Plastique Tiara.

53:34.330 --> 53:37.500
Tonight on the runway, she
looks like an anime character.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.030
She's gorgeous.

53:39.030 --> 53:40.700
[Michelle] I think
she has spent all this time

53:40.700 --> 53:42.470
perfecting what's on the outside

53:42.470 --> 53:44.800
that she's forgetting
about what's on the inside.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.310
I still need more,

53:46.310 --> 53:48.910
or else she's just going to be
that pretty girl over there.

53:48.910 --> 53:50.910
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

53:50.910 --> 53:53.710
In the performance,
I kept losing her.

53:53.710 --> 53:55.420
[Michelle] When you're with
four other girls,

53:55.420 --> 53:58.150
you can't get lost in the mix.
You just can't.

53:58.150 --> 54:00.390
It's do or die here
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

54:00.390 --> 54:02.760
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

54:02.760 --> 54:05.330
Listen, on the opposite end of
the spectrum, very memorable.

54:05.330 --> 54:08.930
[Adam] But tonight on
the runway was a total miss.

54:08.930 --> 54:11.400
[RuPaul] Nina West,
our Viking queen.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.870
You can't win a challenge

54:12.870 --> 54:16.240
if you bring a look like that
to RuPaul's Drag Race.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.940
It wasn't just something
you can buy off the rack.

54:17.940 --> 54:19.470
Are you sure?

54:19.470 --> 54:20.810
Those breasts
were the size of mine,

54:20.810 --> 54:22.480
which are not buyable
off the rack.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.710
You have to go to a doctor.

54:23.710 --> 54:25.580
[all laugh]

54:25.580 --> 54:28.550
But the performance tonight,
I'm a huge Nina fan.

54:28.550 --> 54:30.220
[RuPaul] Scarlet Envy.

54:30.220 --> 54:32.750
Tonight on the runway,
her paint was pretty,

54:32.750 --> 54:35.020
her hair was pretty,
it just wasn't enough.

54:35.020 --> 54:36.290
It needed to be bigger.

54:36.290 --> 54:37.620
She gave us butterfly clips.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.190
Butterflies
are a very tender subject

54:39.190 --> 54:40.190
here at RuPaul's Drag Race.

54:40.190 --> 54:42.730
[all laugh]

54:42.730 --> 54:43.900
She was definitely
the hardest person

54:43.900 --> 54:45.370
I've ever worked with
in my career.

54:45.370 --> 54:46.370
-What?
-You're kidding. Really?

54:46.370 --> 54:48.270
To like to get
to do steps. Yes.

54:48.270 --> 54:49.440
[RuPaul] Because
there's the counting?

54:49.440 --> 54:50.840
[Travis]
It's just the counting.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.710
It was just a really hard
disconnect from brain to foot.

54:52.710 --> 54:55.210
In her defense, your left foot
and your right foot,

54:55.210 --> 54:56.510
they look very similar.

54:56.510 --> 54:58.480
-They're very similar.
-Yeah.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.850
And they're
right next to each other.

54:59.850 --> 55:01.210
-[Michelle] Yes.
-[Adam] I know. I know.

55:01.210 --> 55:02.580
[Travis] It must be really hard
to stand on stage

55:02.580 --> 55:04.580
and have all of your sisters
say your name to go home.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.390
I don't know
what that feels like.

55:06.390 --> 55:07.750
Ru, who do you think
should go home?

55:07.750 --> 55:09.790
-Travis Wall!
-[laughs]

55:09.790 --> 55:13.290
All right, silence.
I've made my decision.

55:13.290 --> 55:16.830
Bring back my golden girls.

55:16.830 --> 55:18.400
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.230
I've made some decisions.

55:23.670 --> 55:27.140
Plastique Tiara,
you found your wings.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.340
Now take me higher.

55:29.340 --> 55:31.610
You're safe.

55:31.610 --> 55:33.950
You may join the other girls.

55:35.080 --> 55:38.120
Scarlet Envy, you are beautiful,

55:38.120 --> 55:43.090
but tonight your performance
didn't score with the judges.

55:43.090 --> 55:46.060
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

55:49.200 --> 55:54.100
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo,
you're a funny bunny,

55:54.100 --> 55:57.070
but stop relying
on that bodysuit.

55:58.710 --> 56:00.210
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

56:03.740 --> 56:08.650
Ra'Jah O'Hara, tonight
you got lost in the crowd.

56:08.650 --> 56:12.850
Nina West,
we have one word for you.

56:12.850 --> 56:14.890
Proportionizing.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.690
Nina West...

56:21.130 --> 56:22.500
You are safe.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.660
Thank you very much.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.910
Ra'Jah, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:33.910 --> 56:36.440
[Ra'Jah] Here we go again.

56:36.440 --> 56:37.840
I'm so sick
of being in the bottom.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.180
[RuPaul] Two queens
stand before me.

56:42.180 --> 56:45.950
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

56:45.950 --> 56:49.960
and save yourself
from elimination.

56:52.460 --> 56:54.730
The time has come...
[thunder]

56:54.730 --> 56:56.860
for you to lip sync...

56:56.860 --> 56:59.830
[echoing] for your life!

57:02.240 --> 57:05.170
[Scarlet] I'm gonna give this
everything I have.

57:05.170 --> 57:06.710
I'm not ready to go home.

57:06.710 --> 57:09.240
Good luck...

57:09.240 --> 57:12.610
and don't fuck it up.
