00:28.895 --> 00:31.497
Adam!

00:37.470 --> 00:39.505
Adam!

00:44.611 --> 00:46.645
Adam!

00:51.484 --> 00:53.452
Adam!

00:57.424 --> 00:58.624
Adam!

01:00.360 --> 01:02.094
Adam!

01:08.868 --> 01:10.636
Adam!

01:28.389 --> 01:30.622
Daddy?

01:33.660 --> 01:34.860
Dad!

01:36.963 --> 01:39.264
Dad!

01:44.671 --> 01:46.238
Adam!

01:51.544 --> 01:53.245
Adam!

01:55.682 --> 01:57.382
Oh, God! Adam!

01:57.384 --> 01:58.817
Oh, God!
Adam!

01:58.819 --> 02:00.052
Oh, my God.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.520
Clint!

02:01.522 --> 02:02.754
Over here!

02:02.756 --> 02:04.156
I found him!

02:05.125 --> 02:09.394
I found him. I found him.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.578
All right, you're good to go.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.221
Hey, Bill.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.489
I heard from head office.
And?

03:44.491 --> 03:45.891
It's not good.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.065
I'm sorry, uh, who'd you--
who did you talk to?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.433
Uh, Janice.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.035
One second.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.737
Hello?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.672
Oh, hey.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.442
No, that-that doesn't matter.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.110
'Cause he doesn't care.

04:05.112 --> 04:08.547
Yes, I will remind him. 6:30.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.082
No.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.984
'Cause that's just who he is.

04:11.986 --> 04:15.120
Okay, I love you, too.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.189
Bye.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.523
Sorry.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.091
Head office wants
this done right away.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.027
They wanna try and save
their third quarter.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.129
Clint, they want you to lay
these people off

04:24.131 --> 04:25.564
by the end of the month.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.165
How many by the end
of the month?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.367
Four.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.335
Four, Bill? Jesus Christ, four?

04:30.337 --> 04:31.637
We gotta do this.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.473
Four people without jobs
is better than 50.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.611
No, you know what?
Call head office one more time.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.446
See if there's anything
we can do. Please?

04:41.448 --> 04:42.848
They're not gonna budge,
Clint.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.250
Well, then those corporate
clowns can come down here

04:45.252 --> 04:46.885
and tell them themselves.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.421
Tell their families they don't
have jobs or money or any--

04:53.059 --> 04:54.793
I'm sorry, Bill. That's not you.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.729
Okay? I get it.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.399
Hey, Gary. What's going on?

05:00.401 --> 05:03.068
There's some guy here,
says he's your brother.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.369
Adam?

05:04.371 --> 05:07.539
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.
I'll be right out.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.790
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.325
I didn't expect you
to come here,

05:26.327 --> 05:28.026
I thought we'd just meet
at the house.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.229
I thought I'd just come by
and, you know,

05:31.231 --> 05:32.864
see the place.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.333
I hope you didn't wait
too long.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.135
No, no. They gave
me some coffee.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.770
You didn't drink it,
did you?

05:38.772 --> 05:41.406
Heh. No.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.741
This thing.

05:42.743 --> 05:46.945
It's been there since
we were kids.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.714
Yeah.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.851
So you're doing dad's
old job, huh?

05:55.455 --> 05:57.456
Well, sort of, I guess.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.758
I'm Head of Operations.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.026
Dad, uh...

06:01.028 --> 06:03.362
Hated sitting
behind a desk, right?

06:03.364 --> 06:06.331
Right.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.100
I could take you on
a tour if you like.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.736
Not that much has changed.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.437
Sure.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.041
All right.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.143
But you'll have to wear
one of these, bud.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.517
You know, on second thought
maybe I'll, uh...

06:25.519 --> 06:26.952
Maybe I'll just see
you at the house.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.488
I'm gonna take a drive
through town.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.423
Yeah, okay. No problem.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.126
See you in a bit.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.560
Oh, hey.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.530
Dinner is at 6:30, all right?

06:38.532 --> 06:41.933
6:30. Got it.

06:59.218 --> 07:02.020
Have I met uncle Adam before?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.221
No.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.257
No, you haven't, buddy.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.426
I'm hungry.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.561
I'm hungry, too.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.134
Okay, fine. Let's eat.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.806
Is that him?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.608
Could be.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.477
Stay right there.

07:34.086 --> 07:37.722
Hey. You're late.

07:37.724 --> 07:42.194
Yeah, sorry. I just...
Lost track of time.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.729
I see.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.566
Well, let's go
meet the family.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.681
Hey, guys. This is
your uncle Adam.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.749
- Hi.
- It's good to see you, Adam.

08:04.751 --> 08:08.253
- You too, Sophie.
- Come on in.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.488
Hey, buddy.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.256
- Hi.
- How old are you?

08:11.258 --> 08:15.694
Six. And she's my little sister,
and she's three.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.029
Three, huh? Hi.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.165
We almost got started
without you.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.733
Well, thanks for waiting.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.793
I went for a drive
around town today.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.495
- Just for old time's sake.
- Oh, yeah?

08:50.497 --> 08:51.696
Yeah.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.632
It hasn't changed one bit.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.267
What did you expect?

08:55.269 --> 08:58.670
An urban sprawl of office
buildings and coffee shops?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.272
A Starbucks maybe?

09:03.243 --> 09:05.477
It's a simpler life, Adam.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.212
Yeah.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.215
What? I didn't say anything!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.416
I know that look.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.954
Man, I can't believe Bradley
is as big as he is.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.055
Yeah.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.357
You know he's gonna
be seven next summer?

09:19.359 --> 09:21.660
Man.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.862
Does he like hunting
as much as his dad?

09:23.864 --> 09:25.130
Of course.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.898
Mostly birds though.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.334
Like, if he had to shoot a deer
he'd probably cry.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.603
I think I'd bawl my eyes out
if I had to shoot a deer.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.573
I'm serious.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.009
You know, I can finish
up here.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.411
Really?

09:39.413 --> 09:40.946
You are excused.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.180
Thank you.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.816
I haven't done dishes
in about 10 years,

09:44.818 --> 09:47.018
so I'm a little out
of practice.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.990
Adam?

09:54.327 --> 09:57.028
He's glad you're here.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.338
"Ladies and gentlemen,
skinny and stout.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.908
"I'll tell you a tale
I know nothing about.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.944
"Admission is free,
so pay at the door.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.614
Pull up a chair
and sit on the floor."

10:37.838 --> 10:40.672
Does uncle Adam want
to stay for a while?

10:40.674 --> 10:46.044
No, he's only gonna stay
for a quick visit.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.080
Could I go hunting
with you?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.916
No, sorry. Not this time,
buddy.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.452
The deer are way, way up
in the mountain,

10:54.454 --> 10:58.757
and it's gonna be a tough climb,
even for your old man.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.841
But I really want to go
with you.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.943
No, I know you do.

11:18.945 --> 11:24.449
And I promise we'll go together
as soon as I get back.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.352
But this is gonna be a really,
really long hike.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.587
And hey, you know how
you like to play

11:29.589 --> 11:31.690
with your little
sister sometimes?

11:31.692 --> 11:34.592
Nope. Not at all.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.830
Yeah, you do.

11:38.832 --> 11:42.434
Anyway, that's kinda what
your uncle and I need.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.537
We just need some time to
play by ourselves, all right?

11:45.539 --> 11:50.341
- Hmm.
- I know.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.444
Okay. Bedtime, buddy.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.029
Where are you going?

12:45.031 --> 12:48.333
I'm just gonna see some of
the guys in town at Lucy's.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.802
Oh. Okay.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.271
What?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.740
Nothing.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.075
Will you relax?

12:57.077 --> 12:59.177
We're gonna be together
for six days.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.578
I-I get it.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.248
Just remember we gotta get up
early tomorrow, all right?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.482
I'll be ready.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.551
6:30 A.M.
I got it.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.787
I know, it's-- you know,
it's just-- you can uh--

13:08.789 --> 13:11.055
I can what?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.824
Lose track of time.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.125
Will you take it easy?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.928
It's a camping trip,
not a shuttle launch.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.329
All right.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.732
I wouldn't go to Lucy's
if I were you.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.835
You'll end up getting drunk and
marrying one of the local gals.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.038
I would have to be extremely
drunk to end up

13:27.040 --> 13:29.641
with one of those town heifers.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.610
Are you calling me
a heifer?

13:32.612 --> 13:37.282
What? No, not you,
I mean--

13:37.284 --> 13:39.818
Come on, you know
what I mean.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.286
You come home drunk,

13:41.288 --> 13:43.621
I'm sending the kids
into your room at 6:00 A.M.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.223
Sure.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.726
Hey, you guys should do
a little um...

13:48.728 --> 13:50.628
Redecorating in here.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.597
It's been the same since 1986.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.867
Start with that couch.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.237
- I like this couch.
- Yeah, me too.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.440
We should change
the wallpaper, though.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.947
Do you want me to run
out to the truck

14:08.949 --> 14:10.548
and get you a proper shirt?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.151
I mean, what is that, anyway?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.886
It's called a t-shirt.
It's a new thing.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.421
I know him.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.022
He invented communism.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.225
Yeah, something like that.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.627
What are you, some sort of
commie now, or what?

14:24.798 --> 14:26.898
Why are you here?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.499
I'm visiting my brother.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.102
Actually, I'm going hunting
with him if you can believe it.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.971
Nobody's got anything bigger
than a grouse

14:32.973 --> 14:34.606
over the last five years.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.642
Your brother'd be off his rocker
if he thinks he can bag a deer.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.012
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
we don't even see one.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.580
Didn't you hate hunting?

14:42.582 --> 14:45.016
Yeah. Still do.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.755
Maybe Clint knows something
we don't know.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.957
Where ya headed,
anyways?

14:52.959 --> 14:55.326
All the way up to the plateau.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.866
What?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.469
You remember Doug Grant?
Hardware store?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.504
- No.
- He went up there 10 years ago.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.941
It was 15 years ago and Doug
was an actual retard.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.743
- Shut up. He wasn't a retard.
- Yes, he was.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.212
Okay. Regardless,
what happened to him?

15:14.214 --> 15:18.583
He went up to the plateau...
Never came back.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.320
And that's it?

15:22.322 --> 15:25.123
And nobody ever found out
what happened to this guy?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.658
Don't worry, buddy.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.227
We'll come looking for you.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.631
I'm gonna get a drink.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.970
Did you charge
your cell phone?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.372
Yeah, the thing is, uh...

15:41.374 --> 15:44.742
Cell phones don't work about
four hours into the hike, so...

15:44.744 --> 15:48.046
Ah, how convenient
for you.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.982
Right?

15:50.984 --> 15:53.251
No, trust me. I would...

15:53.253 --> 15:55.320
I would definitely
call you if I could.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.456
Six days with just
my brother?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.125
Pretty sure I'm gonna end up
just talking to the trees.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.566
Night, hon.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
Goodnight.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.342
- Clint?
- Yeah?

16:17.344 --> 16:20.712
Don't shoot your brother.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.648
I just-- I don't wanna hear
a story that I can't un-hear.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.283
You're wrong, man. You do.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.819
'Cause w-- we--
she just-- I don't know,

16:27.821 --> 16:30.455
she just like turned over
quickly and all of a sudden

16:30.457 --> 16:32.590
her tits were flapping up
in my face!

16:33.994 --> 16:35.626
What do you mean,
she turned around?

16:35.628 --> 16:37.095
How does that happen?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.596
It just-- yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.034
- Boys, it's late.
- Unh. Yeah. Woah.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.369
I think I gotta go home.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.471
Hey, cheers.
It was good to see you guys.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.972
Cheers. Yeah.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.474
Yeah, you too, man.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.045
Don't wait another 15 years
to come back.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.780
Yeah, well if I do,

16:55.782 --> 16:58.883
I bet you guys will be sittin'
right here.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.451
I really hope so.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.622
All right.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.857
Ah.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.090
All right.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.492
Peace.

17:09.595 --> 17:10.795
Ah, shit.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.096
Ow.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.565
Watch your step.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.900
See ya.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.615
<i> Adam!</i>

18:40.886 --> 18:42.286
<i> Adam!</i>

18:55.901 --> 18:58.803
Hey! Oh, my God, Adam!

18:58.805 --> 19:01.305
Oh, Adam, what happened
to you? Huh? Huh?

19:01.307 --> 19:04.142
Clint! Over here!

19:21.860 --> 19:25.263
That mattress is terrible.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.464
No one's ever complained.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.500
You're the first
to whine about it.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.335
Coffee?

19:36.108 --> 19:38.109
Good times with
your old friends?

19:43.048 --> 19:45.850
I'll see you outside.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.676
Wow.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.346
What?

20:16.882 --> 20:20.551
What do you expect to carry
in that backpack?

20:20.553 --> 20:24.388
I got some food,
I got my sleeping bag.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.591
Okay, what kind
of sleeping bag?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.025
What difference
does it make?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.895
It's gonna be
freezing up there.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.831
I don't know what kind
of sleeping bag it is.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.438
What is this?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.872
I packed you a bag.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.907
Why?

20:42.909 --> 20:46.277
Well, let's just say
I had a hunch.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.945
Look. Just because
you think you know

20:47.947 --> 20:52.950
what you're doing does not mean
I need you to pack me a bag.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.318
Right.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.287
Well, then
let's take your car.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.327
Why do you gotta
be such a dick?

21:06.365 --> 21:08.399
I see you traded in
dad's old truck.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.572
Yeah, dad's died
a few years back.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.708
He left you the house,
he left you the truck.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.311
What else did he leave you?

21:20.313 --> 21:23.281
Guilt?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.495
You scared the piss outta me.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.698
Will you come on?
I wanna get there before dark.

22:20.806 --> 22:24.375
- That's dad's gun, right?
- Yep.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.210
Can I use yours?

22:26.212 --> 22:27.812
No.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.915
You can't hit the bright side
of a barn with dad's gun.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.149
Can I drive?

22:32.151 --> 22:33.918
Also no.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.459
- You ready?
- No.

23:34.813 --> 23:39.049
- Man, I love this place.
- Yeah, it's great.

23:40.385 --> 23:43.788
So how far are we going?

23:43.790 --> 23:45.723
Well, we're gonna hike
around to that point,

23:45.725 --> 23:47.992
then we are right
on the plateau.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.527
Wow.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.961
Yeah, I-I still
don't understand why

23:50.963 --> 23:54.064
we don't just take the quad
all the way up there.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.201
I mean, it's a machine
that's built to do that.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.870
Because, precious,
we're doing this old school.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.540
I want the sound of engines and
the smell of gas miles behind.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.510
Poetic.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.887
So we're gonna hike up
to the plateau.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.622
Yeah. Why?

24:20.358 --> 24:22.092
Uh. Nothin'.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.563
Just the, uh, the guys
last night, they were sayin'--

24:25.565 --> 24:28.165
Okay, what did your ladies
tell you last night?

24:28.167 --> 24:31.068
Nothing. They just said nobody
goes up there anymore.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.305
Let me guess. They told you
the story of Doug Grant?

24:34.307 --> 24:35.539
Yeah.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.775
Doug had no business being
up here.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.444
The guy was half retarded.

24:40.446 --> 24:43.481
You know, in the civilized world
we don't use that word anymore.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.416
Just so you know.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.184
Whatever.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.653
People don't come up here
'cause it's a bitch to hike to,

24:49.655 --> 24:51.956
not because of some
old wives tale.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.860
And I bet there are huge deer
just begging to be harvested.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.929
And this was your idea.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.165
Killed.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.500
Huh?

25:02.502 --> 25:04.602
Huge deer up there
just begging to be killed

25:04.604 --> 25:06.003
is what you meant.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.771
Whatever.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.773
I bet even if we miss
we could just walk up and...

25:09.775 --> 25:11.008
Club them with your gun.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.077
- Yeah, exactly.
- Hey, screw it, man.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.945
Listen, I'm in.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.147
Let's go kill some deer
in the face.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.016
Harvest.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.751
Uh, murder.

25:27.159 --> 25:34.498
<i>Okay, Clint, get him on target.</i>

25:34.500 --> 25:36.100
Don't bring your head
to the scope,

25:36.102 --> 25:38.168
but bring the scope
to your head.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.004
Right.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.673
Aim a bit to the right,
the wind'll push it a bit.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.775
You wanna hit him
in the chest.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.478
Okay. I got it, dad.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.013
When you're ready.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.651
He's down.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.019
Great shot, son!

25:55.021 --> 25:56.954
Now the hard work
begins, huh?

25:56.956 --> 25:59.924
The fun stops
when the animal drops.

26:08.199 --> 26:09.500
Hey.

26:09.502 --> 26:12.670
You always wanna keep the shell
from your first kill.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.905
Okay, dad.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.748
You know, there's shooting light
for about another hour or so.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.117
You wanna see
what we can see?

26:27.119 --> 26:30.754
Uh... nah.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.925
You can,
knock yourself out.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.329
I think I'm just gonna chill out
here for a moment.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.565
Oh, yeah.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.634
All right.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.680
Did you hear that noise?

28:02.682 --> 28:04.415
It was hard to miss.

28:04.417 --> 28:07.818
Well, have you ever heard
anything like that before?

28:07.820 --> 28:10.387
No, never.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.122
The hell was that?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.857
Relax, child.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.392
There's a bunch of mines
out here.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.627
They're probably fracking.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.429
The sound carries out here.

28:18.431 --> 28:21.498
You're just used to your
city noises, that's all.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.667
Yeah, well I've never heard
a noise like that,

28:23.669 --> 28:25.069
in the city or anywhere.

28:25.071 --> 28:28.739
And it wasn't fracking,
I'll tell you that much.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.174
Really?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.375
What?

28:31.377 --> 28:34.111
- The fire.
- Oh, come on.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.313
We got a whole other day
of hiking ahead of us.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.448
I'm cold.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.483
The smoke will embed
in our clothes and--

28:39.485 --> 28:41.752
the smoke's gonna-- okay, sure.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.821
Oh, 'cause you hunt. Yeah.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.490
Well-- didn't you bring
any deer piss?

28:46.492 --> 28:48.625
That's what we use to mask
our smells, right?

28:48.627 --> 28:50.594
Deer piss? Am I right?

28:50.596 --> 28:51.929
Yes, as a matter
of fact I did.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.664
Okay, so then what's
the problem?

28:53.666 --> 28:56.066
Okay. Tonight only.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.472
Did you see anything while
you were out there?

29:01.474 --> 29:05.175
Yeah. A small doe.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.579
Really?
That's great!

29:08.581 --> 29:12.983
Maybe we don't have to go
as far to find some deer then.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.119
She's probably just lost.
The big bucks,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.755
they're higher up
the mountain this time of year.

29:25.730 --> 29:27.865
Great. Ah.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.220
What is that?

29:52.891 --> 29:55.959
It's nothing.
Go back to sleep.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.696
I can't go back to sleep.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.198
It sounds like
it's getting closer.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.833
It's just your imagination.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.702
Everything sounds louder
out here.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.005
Woah, woah, woah.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.506
What was that?

30:09.508 --> 30:10.741
Don't-- don't do that.

30:10.743 --> 30:12.376
No, no, no.
I'm-- I'm serious.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.112
I heard something else.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.047
Okay, we're leaving,
all right?

30:17.049 --> 30:18.816
There's no way I'm going up
any further.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.217
Shh.

30:27.059 --> 30:30.427
I told you, everything sounds
louder out here.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.085
Wake up, bro.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.789
We walk from here.
Let's get going.

30:58.791 --> 31:01.859
Can't we just keep taking
the quad?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.161
Nope.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.978
Mom, mom, mom, I got one!

31:20.980 --> 31:22.846
I finally got one.
Where's Adam?

31:22.848 --> 31:24.147
- He's upstairs.
- Okay.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.549
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.153
You guys are late.

31:30.155 --> 31:33.590
Yeah, we had to go up
further than last year.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.325
How'd it go?

31:35.327 --> 31:36.927
Yeah, good.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.428
He got his first one.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.365
Unh. Did he cry?

31:43.368 --> 31:45.202
Of course not.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.075
You should have taken Adam.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.977
He wouldn't have come anyway.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.179
Yeah, but you still
should ask.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.781
He thinks you favor Clint.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.616
He's not like that at all.

31:59.618 --> 32:03.453
Clint and I just like
the same things.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.689
Well, maybe, as the adult
in the relationship,

32:05.691 --> 32:09.226
you can find something that you
and Adam can enjoy together.

32:16.467 --> 32:17.601
Hey, hey, hey.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.270
Get washed up before
you come near me.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.340
Ow!

32:23.342 --> 32:24.975
Out!

32:27.145 --> 32:28.946
Hey, Adam.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.851
Guess what, dink?

32:34.853 --> 32:37.821
Adam, guess what?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.289
I shot a deer.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.325
Got him right in the chest.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.427
Good for you.
You killed something.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.829
Dad said it was the biggest one
he's seen in years.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.864
Almost a fourteen pointer!

32:47.866 --> 32:49.433
I have no idea
what that means.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.568
Oh, well, you have to count
the tines in the rack--

32:51.570 --> 32:54.504
Clint, what I meant to say is,
I don't care.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.673
Well, maybe you would care
if you came with us for once

32:56.675 --> 32:59.810
instead of reading
some stupid comic book.

32:59.812 --> 33:03.380
Walking through the woods
looking for something to kill?

33:03.382 --> 33:05.015
No, thanks.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.450
You're such
a little jerk.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.018
Whatever.

33:08.786 --> 33:09.987
Dick!

33:09.989 --> 33:11.688
Bring it!

34:23.393 --> 34:26.763
Bit different from your spin
and yoga classes, huh?

34:26.764 --> 34:28.165
Shut up.

34:30.301 --> 34:35.172
So the good news is we only
have to get to the top of that.

34:35.174 --> 34:40.043
The bad news is we gotta go
the long way around.

34:40.045 --> 34:41.445
We're going up there?

34:41.447 --> 34:42.978
Yeah.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.380
Well, why don't we just cut
it short

34:44.382 --> 34:46.683
and just climb up
right here?

34:46.685 --> 34:48.885
Because it's too steep,
we don't have ropes,

34:48.887 --> 34:52.688
and you're carrying a 40 pound
backpack, that's why.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.025
It doesn't look
that dangerous to me.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.462
Looks can be deceiving. It's
smarter to just go around.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.898
No, no. Screw the hour
and a half hike.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.600
I'm going up here.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.637
Hey. I'm too old to lug
you out on my back.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.910
Okay.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.779
Don't die.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.604
Shit.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.981
<i> ...first and ten.</i>

35:50.983 --> 35:54.584
<i> The closing minutes</i>
<i> of the fourth quarter.</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:04.961
Are you ignoring this?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.331
Christ Almighty!

36:12.938 --> 36:14.571
Oh, boy.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.485
All right, boys.
All right. Enough.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.187
Clint! Let go
of your brother!

36:30.189 --> 36:31.821
Enough. Hey. Come on.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.623
Fine.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.393
Adam,
go and set the table.

36:36.395 --> 36:40.197
Clint, get those stinky,
bloody clothes off right now.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.243
You know, your uncle and I
used to fight like you guys.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.978
Was your brother
a dickhead, too?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.313
He's not a dickhead.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.181
You guys
are just different.

36:58.183 --> 36:59.716
Oh, you think you're
the first brother

36:59.718 --> 37:02.219
to be annoyed by
his younger sibling?

37:02.221 --> 37:03.653
I don't know.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.089
Why can't
he just be normal?

37:06.091 --> 37:08.758
I know your brother doesn't like
the same things as us.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.661
Adam probably thinks
it's you that's not normal.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.862
I hate him.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.934
You know, time changes
everything, bud.

37:17.936 --> 37:22.172
You're gonna have to suck it up
and be the older brother.

37:22.174 --> 37:23.573
I'll try.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.544
Good. Now go wash up
for dinner, huh?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.546
You smell like
a slaughter house.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.915
- I love you, dad.
- I love you, too, son.

38:50.194 --> 38:52.429
Just tell me, Rambo.

38:52.431 --> 38:55.165
- Go that way 300 yards.
- 300 yards?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.834
That's like three
football fields.

38:57.836 --> 38:58.968
Yes.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.105
And then I want you
to push up and go left.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.507
Okay, but if I see the deer,
why don't I just shoot it?

39:04.509 --> 39:05.709
I have a gun.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.877
Because your job is
to push it up to me.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.380
Oh, I see.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.215
Because you want
first shotsies.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.416
Okay, that's cool.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.085
I get it.

39:15.087 --> 39:17.153
Shotsies?

39:17.155 --> 39:19.622
Just go.

41:07.364 --> 41:08.598
Hey.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.501
So?
Did you miss?

41:11.503 --> 41:13.169
No, I got him for sure.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.005
He just didn't drop.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.540
I can't believe you took
the shot.

41:17.542 --> 41:18.908
Me either.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.877
- So where'd you hit him?
- In the chest, I think,

41:20.879 --> 41:24.647
but he moved a little bit
when I shot.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.049
What'd he look like?

41:26.051 --> 41:28.117
He was big.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.021
You, okay?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.256
Yeah, yeah.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.124
Come on, let's get him.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.873
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.546
What is that?

41:56.548 --> 41:57.947
- I-I--
- What is that?

41:57.949 --> 41:59.883
I don't know!

42:01.285 --> 42:03.553
Come on,
let's just go.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.760
Adam, come on.

42:37.588 --> 42:39.556
What is that shit?

42:39.558 --> 42:41.157
It's dinner, all right?

42:41.159 --> 42:43.560
And it'll be delicious.

42:45.796 --> 42:51.034
You know, I can't believe
you took that shot.

42:51.036 --> 42:54.170
Never in a million years
did I think you would do that.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.809
I feel like shit about it.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.312
You eat meat, right?

43:06.483 --> 43:07.917
I think we should go home
tomorrow.

43:07.919 --> 43:13.456
No. We can't leave
that deer out there.

43:13.458 --> 43:16.225
And all of a sudden why are
you so anxious about going home?

43:16.227 --> 43:20.129
This was your idea.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.299
Why did you wanna come
up here?

43:23.301 --> 43:24.767
Not that I mind,

43:24.769 --> 43:29.105
I've been meaning to call you,
it's just-- why?

43:32.242 --> 43:36.312
I just wanted to see
the town again.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.848
After 15 years?

43:40.951 --> 43:44.887
It just seemed like
the right time.

43:44.889 --> 43:47.123
You're the one who turned
this into a hunting trip.

43:47.125 --> 43:50.159
I thought we could just go
camping or something.

44:03.907 --> 44:08.845
I've been having
these...Dreams.

44:08.847 --> 44:12.582
So you wanted to come up here
because of dreams?

44:12.584 --> 44:16.152
I gotta say that's
a little weird.

44:20.024 --> 44:24.260
You know, dad would have
been happy about this.

44:24.262 --> 44:25.795
Why?

44:25.797 --> 44:27.563
Because I'm hunting?

44:27.565 --> 44:29.132
No, you idiot.

44:29.134 --> 44:30.333
Because...

44:35.372 --> 44:38.841
You know, no matter what,
he was our dad.

44:40.944 --> 44:42.478
He was way more
of a dad to you.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.614
Well you certainly didn't
take the high road

44:44.616 --> 44:45.915
when he needed you,
did you?

44:45.917 --> 44:48.651
He didn't need me.
He had you.

44:48.653 --> 44:50.286
I had to look after him
all by myself.

44:50.288 --> 44:51.554
You think that was fun?

44:51.556 --> 44:54.023
Do you really think that he
would have wanted me around?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.558
I wanted you around, Adam.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.695
I wanted you there for me.
For me.

44:58.697 --> 45:02.365
Can you jus-- you know what?
Never mind.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.907
You know he asked about you
all the time?

45:10.909 --> 45:13.309
He wanted to know
what you were up to.

45:13.311 --> 45:17.613
And he hoped you would visit
one last time.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.849
I came for the funeral.

45:21.485 --> 45:23.986
The fu-- the funeral?

45:23.988 --> 45:26.723
That was closure for you.

45:29.226 --> 45:32.061
I didn't come up here
to defend him.

45:34.631 --> 45:37.834
That part of
our lives is over.

45:37.836 --> 45:40.403
I just promised him I would
make it right.

45:40.405 --> 45:44.073
And when you suggested
coming up here I thought--

45:44.075 --> 45:47.243
I thought you could close
the book.

45:47.245 --> 45:51.614
You and I will never agree
about our father.

45:51.616 --> 45:52.849
If you're okay with that,

45:52.851 --> 45:56.786
then I'm okay with closing
the book.

45:56.788 --> 45:59.388
That looks like shit.

46:09.032 --> 46:11.834
What came between
you and dad, anyway?

46:14.471 --> 46:16.906
You.

47:17.734 --> 47:19.502
Who are you?

47:29.681 --> 47:31.347
You okay?

47:33.183 --> 47:35.585
Yeah. I-I just, uh...

47:37.421 --> 47:38.921
I had a bad dream.

47:40.891 --> 47:43.226
Want your binkie?

48:11.955 --> 48:14.457
Adam, I got it.

48:14.459 --> 48:16.993
You're kidding?

48:16.995 --> 48:18.895
That's great.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.396
Let's go.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.764
Yeah.

48:58.468 --> 49:01.137
Maybe we can see something
from up there.

49:02.005 --> 49:04.707
Where?

49:09.012 --> 49:11.547
Oh, shit.

49:12.549 --> 49:13.950
Come on.

50:01.698 --> 50:04.033
What the hell?

50:14.711 --> 50:16.545
Adam.

50:33.196 --> 50:36.999
This is seriously
fucked up, man.

50:37.001 --> 50:38.667
- One second.
- No, no.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.404
No, Adam, this is
a very bad idea.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.348
I recognize this place.
It's, uh...

50:57.220 --> 50:58.754
Listen, I don't care.

50:58.756 --> 51:00.523
We gotta get outta here.

51:03.927 --> 51:05.127
Yeah, you're right.

51:05.129 --> 51:07.329
Let's get the hell
outta here.

51:26.716 --> 51:27.983
Adam. Slow down.

51:27.985 --> 51:30.853
<i> Adam, slow down!</i>

51:33.791 --> 51:35.491
Adam!

51:35.493 --> 51:36.792
Oh, shit! Shit!

51:36.794 --> 51:38.794
Hang on, buddy!

51:47.304 --> 51:50.072
- Here we go. Here we go.
- No, no, no! Aah!

52:09.025 --> 52:10.860
What did you do?

52:10.862 --> 52:12.962
I'm sorry, bro. I had to.

52:12.964 --> 52:16.799
You wouldn't have been able
to move if I didn't.

52:16.801 --> 52:20.936
You have any morphine
in that pack?

52:20.938 --> 52:23.405
No, sorry.

52:34.417 --> 52:36.118
What do you want? Let me get it.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.254
I got it.

52:42.759 --> 52:44.059
You can give it a try,

52:44.061 --> 52:45.761
but I wouldn't get
your hopes up.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.200
Nothing.

52:52.636 --> 52:55.304
We're moving more in the open
tomorrow morning.

52:55.306 --> 52:57.540
Give it another try then,
all right?

53:01.011 --> 53:02.811
Sure.

53:10.153 --> 53:14.356
What the hell was that shit
up there?

53:14.358 --> 53:16.325
I'm not sure, man.

53:22.566 --> 53:24.600
What?

53:24.602 --> 53:26.635
Nothing.

53:26.637 --> 53:29.705
It's just my imagination
getting the better of me.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.840
What?

53:31.842 --> 53:33.509
It was just an old deer
or something.

53:33.511 --> 53:36.545
Antlers were all broken
and ugly.

53:39.616 --> 53:42.751
What happened to you
up there?

53:42.753 --> 53:45.421
I don't know.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.456
You said you recognized
the place, but you've--

53:47.458 --> 53:49.558
you've never been
there since--

53:51.795 --> 53:53.862
since when?

53:53.864 --> 53:57.466
You don't remember?

53:57.468 --> 53:58.968
Dad and I lost you
when you were four.

53:58.970 --> 54:02.972
We were hiking and you just...
disappeared.

54:02.974 --> 54:04.974
What? What happened?

54:04.976 --> 54:06.609
Nothing. Nothing happened.

54:06.611 --> 54:11.780
We-- we found you after a few
hours, dad was panicking and...

54:11.782 --> 54:15.050
Seriously, you don't
remember at all?

54:15.052 --> 54:17.720
<i> No. Nothing.</i>

54:22.393 --> 54:26.795
You never did
like the outdoors.

54:26.797 --> 54:27.997
I still don't.

54:31.067 --> 54:33.269
Dad just thought you were gay.

54:43.546 --> 54:48.984
What was that stupid thing
dad used to say?

54:48.986 --> 54:52.187
Something about being at
the office and hunting...

54:52.189 --> 54:53.689
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:53.691 --> 54:57.526
A bad day huntin' beats a good
day workin' every time.

54:57.528 --> 55:00.562
I've never disagreed
with him more.

55:00.564 --> 55:02.031
That's saying something.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.675
What's with all these crows?

55:14.879 --> 55:16.145
Adam!

55:19.083 --> 55:21.750
Adam! Adam!

55:21.752 --> 55:23.886
What the fuck?
What the fuck!

55:23.888 --> 55:26.422
- What the hell was that?
- We are leaving right now!

55:26.424 --> 55:28.223
- What the hell grabbed me?
- Come on!

55:28.225 --> 55:29.458
- Was it a bear?
- No, no!

55:29.460 --> 55:30.859
Goddamn bear!

55:38.968 --> 55:42.204
Why won't you tell me
what it was? Clint!

55:42.206 --> 55:44.606
Because I don't know,
Adam!

55:44.608 --> 55:46.442
It's nothing
I've ever seen before.

55:46.444 --> 55:47.910
Jesus Christ!

55:47.912 --> 55:50.546
It doesn't change the fact
that we gotta get off

55:50.548 --> 55:52.181
the goddamn mountain!
All right?

55:52.183 --> 55:54.717
It doesn't matter! We'd be in
the same boat if it was a bear!

55:54.719 --> 55:57.119
No, we wouldn't! At least,
a bear is an animal!

55:57.121 --> 55:58.721
Whatever, we gotta leave.

55:58.723 --> 56:01.156
Being scared and pissing
ourselves doesn't get us off

56:01.158 --> 56:02.658
this goddamn mountain!

56:02.660 --> 56:04.326
Do you even know where
you're going?

56:04.328 --> 56:08.330
I am just trying to get away.
Farther away.

56:08.332 --> 56:09.732
What the fuck does that mean?

56:09.734 --> 56:11.633
Well what the hell do you
wanna do? Huh?

56:11.635 --> 56:14.536
You wanna-- you wanna wait
for that thing to come?

56:19.476 --> 56:21.643
Come on.

56:21.645 --> 56:23.445
- Almost there.
- Okay.

56:44.801 --> 56:47.035
Come on. Sit down.

56:56.079 --> 56:57.279
Are you okay?

56:57.281 --> 56:59.047
Are you gonna
be all right here?

56:59.049 --> 57:01.016
Yeah.

57:12.228 --> 57:15.297
If you see anything
that isn't me, you shoot it.

57:15.299 --> 57:16.565
You hear me?

57:16.567 --> 57:18.367
I'll come back down.

57:18.369 --> 57:20.068
That's a good plan.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.307
Where's your phone?

57:25.309 --> 57:27.476
In the pocket of my bag.

57:33.016 --> 57:35.651
Oh, God.

57:43.593 --> 57:44.993
You good?

57:44.995 --> 57:46.295
Yeah.

57:46.297 --> 57:47.596
Okay.

57:47.598 --> 57:50.065
If you could hurry
that'd be fantastic.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.767
I'm on it.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.369
You okay?

58:27.371 --> 58:29.505
Yeah, I'm good!

59:59.162 --> 01:00:03.198
Goddamn cell phone.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:12.274
Adam! You still okay?

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.276
<i> Yeah, I sure am!</i>

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.112
Yeah, I'm coming down now!

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.797
Come on.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:42.938
Adam! I see something!

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.273
What?

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:46.475
Adam!

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.410
Adam, it's coming!

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.380
Where is it?

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.885
I don't see anything!

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:58.453
Adam, it's right
in front of you!

01:00:58.455 --> 01:00:59.721
Shoot!

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:01.123
Shoot it!

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.486
Holy shit! Holy shit!

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:33.255
Oh, my God!

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.727
Oh, my God.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.415
Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.861
Okay, okay, okay,
it's okay.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.604
Oh, Jesus!

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.005
Oh, God!

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.049
Oh, God!

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.521
Okay.

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:29.998
Adam?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.467
Adam, are you--
are you there?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.520
I'll get you out!

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.222
I'll get you out!

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.638
I can't.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.207
I can't. I can't.

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:54.669
Oh, God. Oh, please.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:13.655
Hello?

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.356
S-Sophie?

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:19.027
Hello? Who is this?

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:21.662
Sophie, it's me--
it's me, Clint.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:22.863
Clint?

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.099
Yes! Sophie!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.500
Sophie!

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:26.935
Sophie--

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.171
you're cutting in and out.
Where are you?

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:32.674
I'm sorry.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.975
Sorry for what?

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:36.911
I can't--
I can't leave him.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.582
Clint!

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:41.883
Sophie?

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:44.786
No! No.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.666
Where is he?

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.757
Adam, is that you?

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.793
You're awake.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.332
What happened?

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.608
Where are we?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.478
You really think
we're done with you?

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.752
Hey, easy. Easy Adam.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:33.054
Calm down.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.691
Calm down, bud.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.826
It's me, okay?

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.596
Adam.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:51.205
Where are we?

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:55.043
We're almost back
to the truck.

01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:57.979
How long was I out?

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.814
A while.

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:02.984
Are you okay?

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.763
What the hell
happened to me?

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:23.204
I don't know for sure.

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:25.740
But you're back, all right?

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:35.083
I felt like-like something
was trying to take me.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:40.922
It took me, didn't it?

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.224
Oh, God.

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.626
I can still feel it!
Ah, ha.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.161
Come on, Clint!
We have to go!

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:51.699
Adam, listen.
Listen. Listen.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:57.038
The quad's out of gas, but we
are only a half day walk away.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.143
You just-- you just
need to rest.

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:10.151
We will leave
at first light.

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.234
What the hell?

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:27.835
It's that...

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.851
Where are you?
Where are you?

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.126
Damn it!

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.868
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.612
Clint! Clint!

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:19.520
Clint, what's wrong?

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.991
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:54.615
No! No!

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.824
Clint!

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.695
What happened?

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.132
Where's your brother?

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:54.669
He-- he--

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.070
Oh, there he is.
