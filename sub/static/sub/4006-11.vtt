UNTIL YOUR MURDERING ASS
IS BEHIND BARS FOR GOOD.

26:51.583 --> 26:54.834
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA
WORK OUT OUR ISSUES.

26:54.834 --> 26:57.959
BUT, HEY...

26:57.959 --> 27:02.041
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.625
- OKAY.

27:15.792 --> 27:18.625
- SON OF A BITCH.
- YOU GOT A DEAD ONE.

27:20.542 --> 27:22.709
- YEAH.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.166
WELL, IT'S GONNA HAVE
TO STAY DEAD.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.333
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
A MAN CAN DO.

27:26.333 --> 27:29.125
WHAT BRINGS YOU AROUND?

27:29.125 --> 27:31.000
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.834
I NOTICED YOU WERE ON EMPTY.
- [chuckles]

27:33.834 --> 27:37.000
THANKS.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.500
- I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT
THE LAST CONVERSATION WE HAD.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.291
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

27:41.291 --> 27:44.875
I SHOULD HAVE COME FORWARD
WITH MY SUSPICION ABOUT DOAKES.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.166
MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE ALIVE.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.709
- NO, IF ANYONE
SHOULD APOLOGIZE, IT'S ME.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.000
I WAS STUPID.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.750
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE EVEN
ENTERTAINED MARIA'S CRAZY THEORY

27:52.750 --> 27:54.875
ABOUT YOU BEING
THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.333
- YOU THINK SHE'LL EVER
ACCEPT THE TRUTH?

27:57.333 --> 28:00.291
- SHE ALREADY HAS.
WE FOUND DOAKES'S BOATHOUSE.

28:00.291 --> 28:01.917
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.500
WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING

28:03.500 --> 28:05.667
IS WHAT WE FOUND
HIDDEN INSIDE IT.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.166
I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS
EXCEPT TO SAY

28:08.166 --> 28:10.709
THAT IT LEAVES NO DOUBT
AS TO DOAKES'S GUILT.

28:10.709 --> 28:12.125
BELIEVE ME,

28:12.125 --> 28:14.792
YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT LAGUERTA ANYMORE.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.208
- [laughs]

28:16.208 --> 28:18.125
WELL...

28:18.125 --> 28:20.709
[laughs] I GOTTA SAY THAT'S
ABOUT THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT

28:20.709 --> 28:23.291
I COULD HAVE IMAGINED.
- YOU AND ME BOTH.

28:23.291 --> 28:24.875
HAVE A GOOD CHRISTMAS
WITH YOUR BOY.

28:24.875 --> 28:27.458
- WE WILL.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.542
CHRISTMAS JUST GOT A LOT LESS
MERRY FOR HECTOR ESTRADA.

28:32.542 --> 28:35.709
MY LATE-LAMENTED DARK PASSENGER
WOULD BE VERY PLEASED.

28:35.709 --> 28:38.834
IF I CAN BREAK THIS LAST STRAND
FROM MY PAST,

28:38.834 --> 28:41.000
DO I GET THE FUTURE I WANT?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.542
[cell phone rings]
- YEP.

28:42.542 --> 28:44.500
- I JUST WENT
TO SEE MATTHEWS AGAIN.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.125
THEY'RE CALLING OFF
THE INVESTIGATION.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.875
- YOU SURE?

28:48.875 --> 28:51.709
- YEAH. THEY BOUGHT IT.
EVERYTHING.

28:51.709 --> 28:54.583
- WELL, LET'S HOPE
THEY STAY BOUGHT.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.667
- THANKS, DEB.

28:59.875 --> 29:02.166
[background chatter]

29:05.667 --> 29:07.417
YOU HECTOR ESTRADA?

29:07.417 --> 29:09.542
- I KNOW YOU?
- YOU DO NOW.

29:09.542 --> 29:12.625
I'M STEVE GASKILL.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.667
COME ON, MAN.
YOU'RE A LEGEND.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.083
- YOU'RE GONNA BE A STAIN
ON MY SHOE

29:16.083 --> 29:18.375
IF YOU DON'T CRAWL BACK
TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

29:18.375 --> 29:20.208
- LOOK, I KNOW I'M PROBABLY
WAY OUTTA LINE HERE,

29:20.208 --> 29:22.375
BUT I REALLY GOTTA TELL YOU
ABOUT MY SITUATION.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.875
I HAVE THIS CONTACT IN HONDURAS,
AN OLD ARMY BUDDY.

29:24.875 --> 29:27.917
HE SENDS ME A CRATE OF SATIVA
EVERY OTHER MONTH.

29:27.917 --> 29:30.250
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO LAY IT OFF WHERE I CAN,

29:30.250 --> 29:32.041
YOU KNOW, COLLEGE CAMPUSES
AND WHATNOT,

29:32.041 --> 29:33.667
BUT KEEPS PILING UP.

29:33.667 --> 29:35.166
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO MOVE.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.625
- HOW MUCH
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

29:36.625 --> 29:38.500
- ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU
SHIT YOUR PANTS.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.542
ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND A WAY

29:40.542 --> 29:42.250
INTO THE HISPANIC MARKET.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.250
HERE YOU ARE.
IT'S KISMET.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.250
- KISS WHO?

29:46.250 --> 29:49.166
- IT'S, UH, GOOD LUCK...
FOR BOTH OF US.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.291
I CAN SHOW YOU THE STUFF.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.709
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.625
MAYBE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.834
- FIRST, LET ME HEAR YOU SAY
YOU'RE NOT A COP.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.875
- I'M NOT A COP, MAN.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.709
JEEZ, WE KNOW A LOT
OF THE SAME PEOPLE--

30:00.709 --> 30:02.542
TUERTO, PEPE CHAO.

30:02.542 --> 30:04.041
I'VE SOLD PLENTY
OF SHIT TO THEM.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.875
- [laughs]
FUCK!

30:05.875 --> 30:08.583
LONG TIME SINCE I'VE DEALT
WITH THOSE GUYS.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.917
WHERE AND WHEN?

30:13.917 --> 30:17.041
- 35 QUAYSIDE ROAD.
TONIGHT. 10:00.

30:17.041 --> 30:20.750
UNLESS YOU GOT SOMETHING ELSE
TO DO ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.625
- I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

30:24.417 --> 30:25.917
[cell phone buzzes]

30:27.917 --> 30:29.625
- YEP.
- DEX, IT'S ANGEL.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.542
DEBRA'S AT ST. JOSEPH'S
IN HIALEAH.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.750
SHE'S BEEN
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

30:32.750 --> 30:35.417
I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE HOSPITAL.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.500
- DEX.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.875
- HOW IS SHE?

30:47.875 --> 30:49.458
- SHE'S FINE.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.792
HER WRIST IS BROKEN,
AND THERE'S LOTS OF BRUISING,

30:51.792 --> 30:53.500
BUT SHE'LL BE OUT
BY TOMORROW.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.125
- WHAT HAPPENED?

30:55.125 --> 30:57.667
- APPARENTLY, SHE BLACKED OUT
OR SOMETHING BEHIND THE WHEEL.

30:57.667 --> 31:02.333
DOES DEBRA HAVE A PRESCRIPTION
FOR ANTIANXIETY MEDICATION?

31:02.333 --> 31:04.000
I MEAN, NOT THAT THERE'S
A PROBLEM.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.834
MOST PEOPLE DO.
- YEAH, SHE DOES. WHY?

31:06.834 --> 31:09.667
- THE DOCTOR SAID THERE WAS
A LOT OF THAT IN HER SYSTEM,

31:09.667 --> 31:12.333
ALMOST THREE TIMES
THE NORMAL DOSE.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.458
NOW, MAYBE SHE LOST TRACK
ON HOW MUCH SHE TOOK.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.333
YOU KNOW.
IT HAPPENS.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.375
- WELL, WHY IS SHE HERE
IN HIALEAH?

31:20.375 --> 31:21.750
WHERE WAS SHE GOING?

31:21.750 --> 31:23.792
- UM...

31:23.792 --> 31:26.208
DEBRA DROVE OUT HERE
FOR AN INTERVIEW,

31:26.208 --> 31:28.458
A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH A WOMAN
NAMED ARLENE SHRAM.

31:28.458 --> 31:32.125
NOW, LOOK, DEX, MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE NOW,

31:32.125 --> 31:34.000
BUT...

31:34.000 --> 31:35.709
DEB GOT A TIP

31:35.709 --> 31:38.125
THAT THIS WOMAN,
ARLENE SHRAM,

31:38.125 --> 31:41.375
WAS A POSSIBLE WITNESS
TO A MURDER...

31:41.375 --> 31:43.875
A MURDER COMMITTED
BY HANNAH MCKAY.

31:45.458 --> 31:46.875
- YES, YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.208
- DEBRA HAS A BUG UP HER ASS
WITH THIS GIRL.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.750
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE TOOK
ALL THOSE ANTIANXIETY PILLS.

31:52.750 --> 31:56.834
BECAUSE SHE'S CONVINCED THAT HER
BROTHER IS DATING A KILLER.

32:00.083 --> 32:03.250
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

32:03.250 --> 32:06.000
I WAS TIRED.
I WAS DRIVING.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.458
I KEPT GETTING SLEEPIER
AND SLEEPIER,

32:08.458 --> 32:11.667
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I MUST HAVE...

32:11.667 --> 32:13.250
CLOSED MY EYES FOR A SECOND?

32:13.250 --> 32:14.917
BUT THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS...

32:14.917 --> 32:17.583
- HANGING UPSIDE DOWN
IN A DITCH.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.000
- HANGING BY MY SEATBELT.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.917
- [exhales]

32:21.917 --> 32:25.250
- THIS IS THE MOST FUCKED-EST
CHRISTMAS EVER.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.542
- AND WERE GONNA SPEND IT
WITH ARLENE SHRAM.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.458
- HANNAH TOLD YOU.

32:31.458 --> 32:34.542
- HANNAH KNEW?

32:34.542 --> 32:37.083
- SHE WAS AT MY HOUSE
YESTERDAY

32:37.083 --> 32:40.250
ASKING ME TO BACK OFF.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.792
ARLENE MUST HAVE CALLED HER
AFTER I LEFT HER HOUSE--

32:42.792 --> 32:46.083
- HANNAH WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
YESTERDAY?

32:46.083 --> 32:48.166
- YES.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.625
AND NOW I'M HERE.

32:54.625 --> 32:57.125
FUCKING HELL, DEXTER.

32:57.125 --> 32:59.083
- SHE DIDN'T POISON YOU.

32:59.083 --> 33:02.291
- WELL, I SURE AS SHIT DIDN'T
SWALLOW A HANDFUL OF PILLS.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.458
- THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE

33:04.458 --> 33:06.750
THE DRUGS BUILT UP
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

33:06.750 --> 33:10.792
- [laughs]
I TOOK ONE.

33:10.792 --> 33:14.625
ONE. LAST NIGHT.

33:14.625 --> 33:18.000
THAT DRUG HAS A SHORT
HALF-LIFE.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.125
GOTTA HAND IT TO HER.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PLAN.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.125
MAKING IT LOOK LIKE
I ACCIDENTALLY TOOK

33:25.125 --> 33:27.333
TOO MUCH OF A PRESCRIPTION
THAT I HAVE?

33:27.333 --> 33:29.709
IT'S NOT A HARD DRUG TO GET.

33:29.709 --> 33:31.709
- HOW WOULD SHE EVEN KNOW
THAT YOU WERE ON IT?

33:31.709 --> 33:35.083
- YOU MUST HAVE MENTIONED IT.
- I NEVER DID. NO.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.834
- [scoffs]
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT PEOPLE

33:36.834 --> 33:40.458
THAT POISON PEOPLE, DEXTER--
THEY'RE REALLY FUCKING SNEAKY.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.667
- SO...

33:42.667 --> 33:44.250
SHE, WHAT, POISONED YOU

33:44.250 --> 33:46.000
WHILE SHE WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
LAST NIGHT?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.166
- I DIDN'T LET HER INSIDE
MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.875
- DEB--
- I WENT FOR A RUN.

33:49.875 --> 33:52.834
MAYBE SHE BROKE IN
AFTER I LEFT OR SOMETHING.

33:52.834 --> 33:56.792
- SHE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE
AND DID WHAT?

33:59.959 --> 34:01.834
- I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DID IT.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.625
- BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T.
- FUCK.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.542
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO SAL PRICE.

34:05.542 --> 34:08.041
AS SOON AS HE GOT CLOSE TO
KNOWING THE TRUTH ABOUT HANNAH,

34:08.041 --> 34:09.792
SHE KILLED HIM.
- THERE'S NO PROOF

34:09.792 --> 34:11.625
THAT SHE KILLED SAL PRICE,

34:11.625 --> 34:14.000
AND THERE'S CERTAINLY NO PROOF
THAT SHE POISONED YOU.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.542
- WELL, MAYBE WE NEED
TO FIND THE PROOF.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.333
- [sighs]

34:23.041 --> 34:25.458
I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.583
YOU TOOK MORE OF THOSE PILLS

34:27.583 --> 34:28.959
THAN YOU THINK YOU DID.

34:28.959 --> 34:30.875
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS, DEB.

34:30.875 --> 34:34.000
- NO SHIT, SHERLOCK.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.500
- SO YOU TOOK ONE
AND YOU LOST TRACK.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.875
YOU TOOK ANOTHER.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.709
AND ANOTHER--
IT'S POSSIBLE.

34:40.709 --> 34:42.875
IT HAPPENS.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.375
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT.
RIGHT?

34:47.542 --> 34:49.333
- [sighs]

34:49.333 --> 34:51.125
- DEB'S MORE RIGHT
THAN SHE KNOWS

34:51.125 --> 34:53.166
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO SAL PRICE.

34:53.166 --> 34:56.583
BUT HANNAH WOULDN'T
DO THAT TO DEBRA.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.417
WOULD SHE?

35:04.750 --> 35:08.583
I MAKE MY LIVING AT CRIME
SCENES, PROVING WHAT HAPPENED.

35:10.625 --> 35:14.709
BUT NOW CAN I PROVE
WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

35:14.709 --> 35:17.458
PROVE THAT HANNAH
DIDN'T POISON DEBRA?

35:44.750 --> 35:48.125
IS THIS PROOF
THAT HANNAH WAS HERE?

35:51.083 --> 35:54.000
DID SHE BREAK IN?

36:00.875 --> 36:05.417
OR DID SHE SIMPLY WALK THROUGH
AN OPEN DOOR?

36:05.417 --> 36:09.375
OR DID THIS FALL OFF ME?
DID I TRACK THIS IN JUST NOW?

36:09.375 --> 36:10.834
THE DRUG WORKS QUICKLY.

36:10.834 --> 36:14.667
DEB WOULD HAVE PASSED OUT
MINUTES AFTER INGESTING IT.

36:16.709 --> 36:18.208
- SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

36:18.208 --> 36:20.917
- NO. MY SISTER'S
DOING FINE.

36:20.917 --> 36:25.333
- YEAH. CAN'T SAY THE SAME
THING FOR THIS POOR BABY.

36:25.333 --> 36:28.375
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO IN
THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.041
- [sighs]

36:58.166 --> 36:59.625
I'LL SEE WHAT THE LAB
HAS TO SAY

36:59.625 --> 37:02.166
ABOUT WHAT'S IN THIS BOTTLE.

37:04.041 --> 37:05.583
HANNAH DIDN'T POISON DEBRA.

37:05.583 --> 37:09.208
ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS
IS FOR THAT TO BE TRUE.

37:11.875 --> 37:14.250
[knock at door]

37:14.250 --> 37:15.750
- MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE.

37:15.750 --> 37:19.041
WE'RE HAVING A NOCHE BUENA
AT THE RESTAURANT LATER.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.875
AURI WILL BE THERE.
YOU SHOULD COME BY.

37:21.875 --> 37:25.291
- UH, THANK YOU BUT, UH...

37:25.291 --> 37:27.083
I'M NOT UP FOR IT.

37:27.083 --> 37:30.250
HOLIDAYS, FAMILY, CHEER...

37:30.250 --> 37:32.875
- THEY'RE KEEPING DEBRA
OVERNIGHT AT THE HOSPITAL.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.375
I THOUGHT YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

37:34.375 --> 37:35.375
- I KNOW.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.250
YOU WANNA TELL ME
THE REAL REASON YOU'RE HERE?

37:45.083 --> 37:47.166
- I BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME

37:47.166 --> 37:49.417
AFTER ALL THIS.
- YEAH?

37:49.417 --> 37:51.792
- I'M ENJOYING THE RESTAURANT,
EVEN WITH ALL THE HEADACHES.

37:54.417 --> 37:55.834
IT'S REAL.

37:55.834 --> 37:58.125
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

37:58.125 --> 38:01.250
YOU OPEN UP,
YOU FEED PEOPLE,

38:01.250 --> 38:03.125
YOU CLEAN UP,

38:03.125 --> 38:05.458
YOU CLOSE UP,
AND YOU GO HOME.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.500
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S YOUR DAY.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.458
YOU DON'T CARRY IT WITH YOU.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.375
- NOT LIKE THIS JOB?
- NO.

38:13.375 --> 38:17.333
AND UP UNTIL,
I DON'T KNOW...

38:17.333 --> 38:18.625
MIKE'S DEATH MAYBE,

38:18.625 --> 38:22.458
IT NEVER GOT TO ME.

38:22.458 --> 38:26.041
- IT'S TIME, ISN'T IT?

38:26.041 --> 38:29.667
- YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S NEXT?

38:29.667 --> 38:33.125
- SOMETIMES.

38:33.125 --> 38:36.250
I'VE BEEN LOOKING BACK
A LITTLE TOO, YOU KNOW,

38:36.250 --> 38:40.834
WONDERING ABOUT SOME
CHOICES I'VE MADE...

38:40.834 --> 38:42.792
WISHING I'D MADE
DIFFERENT ONES.

38:42.792 --> 38:45.875
- WH--A-ARE YOU, UH...
TALKING ABOUT ME?

38:45.875 --> 38:47.667
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU,
ABOUT US?

38:47.667 --> 38:50.291
YOU--YOU--ARE YOU WISHING
THAT IT WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT?

38:50.291 --> 38:51.709
- NO.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.583
NO.

38:53.583 --> 38:56.125
- OKAY. JUST CHECKING.

38:56.125 --> 39:00.208
- SO...WHEN ARE YOU RETIRING?

39:00.208 --> 39:02.667
- THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING
MY PAPERS IN ON THE FIRST.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.667
- HAPPY NEW YEAR.

39:09.667 --> 39:12.291
- LET'S HOPE.
- MM-HMM.

39:14.458 --> 39:17.917
- DEXTER.
HEY.

39:17.917 --> 39:20.333
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.250
- OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE!

39:26.250 --> 39:29.000
- DADDY'S HOME.
- COME HERE, BUD.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.417
[sighs]
YEAH.

39:32.417 --> 39:33.834
THANKS FOR STAYING OVER
TONIGHT.

39:33.834 --> 39:35.417
- MY PLEASURE.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.625
EVER SINCE
I'VE GONE VEGETARIAN,

39:37.625 --> 39:39.834
THE IDEA OF WATCHING MY BROTHER
ROAST A WHOLE PIG

39:39.834 --> 39:42.208
GROSSES ME OUT.

39:42.208 --> 39:44.875
BESIDES,
YOU GUYS ARE FAMILY TOO.

39:44.875 --> 39:47.125
- YEAH. SO ARE YOU.

39:47.125 --> 39:50.208
- HOW'S DEBRA?
- YEAH, HOW'S SHE DOING?

39:50.208 --> 39:52.208
- SHE'S FINE.
SHE SHOULD BE OUT TOMORROW.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.375
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

39:54.375 --> 39:57.333
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
DEXTER.

40:06.041 --> 40:09.041
[Harrison giggling]

40:09.041 --> 40:11.667
- LOOK AT HER.
SO BEAUTIFUL.

40:21.959 --> 40:26.125
BUT CAN YOU EVER FULLY TRUST
A POISONER?

40:26.125 --> 40:28.041
[Harrison giggling]

40:30.208 --> 40:33.083
- [voice echoing]
MMM...

40:33.083 --> 40:36.291
OKAY, DEXTER?

40:36.291 --> 40:38.250
[echoing fades]
DEXTER.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.667
- EARTH TO DEXTER.

40:40.667 --> 40:43.250
I THINK YOUR FOOD COMA'S
HITTING WAY EARLY.

40:43.250 --> 40:45.333
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40:45.333 --> 40:48.458
- UH, A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.250
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME
OF EXPECTATION.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.959
IF YOU'RE GOOD,
A RED-SUITED FAT MAN

40:53.959 --> 40:56.875
WILL BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE
AND LEAVE YOU PRESENTS.

40:56.875 --> 41:00.667
BUT SANTA CLAUS DOESN'T EXIST.

41:00.667 --> 41:04.500
THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME
OF THE YEAR CELEBRATES A LIE.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.667
IS THE FUTURE I IMAGINE
WITH HANNAH

41:11.667 --> 41:15.250
NOTHING MORE THAN A VISION
DANCING IN MY HEAD?

41:29.875 --> 41:33.625
- IT'S FUNNY HOW WE STARTED OFF
IN SANTA'S HOLIDAY ADVENTURE

41:33.625 --> 41:35.208
AND HERE WE ARE,

41:35.208 --> 41:38.083
CHRISTMAS EVE TOGETHER.

41:38.083 --> 41:41.000
A PLACE I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE WITH ANYONE...AGAIN.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.291
MUCH LESS YOU.

41:46.041 --> 41:48.625
- THANKS.

41:48.625 --> 41:50.875
- I'M NOT SAYING THIS
QUITE RIGHT.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.542
UM...

41:53.542 --> 41:55.917
ALL THE MEN
THAT I'VE BEEN WITH--

41:55.917 --> 41:58.750
THERE WAS A LOT OF...

41:58.750 --> 42:01.208
RUNNING AWAY.

42:01.208 --> 42:04.125
BUT WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

42:04.125 --> 42:06.542
I DON'T WANNA GO ANYWHERE.

42:13.375 --> 42:16.333
STAY WITH ME TONIGHT.

42:16.333 --> 42:20.125
- NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE.

42:20.125 --> 42:22.625
- DEBRA?

42:27.667 --> 42:30.333
ESTRADA?

42:33.041 --> 42:34.458
GOOD FOR YOU.

42:34.458 --> 42:37.333
I KNOW HE'S SOMEBODY THAT YOU'VE
WANTED FOR A LONG TIME.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.542
- SOMEONE I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER GET.

42:40.542 --> 42:44.667
- I IMAGINE THAT WILL BE
DEEPLY SATISFYING.

42:52.709 --> 42:55.125
- WHEN DEB HAD HER ACCIDENT...

42:55.125 --> 42:58.542
SHE WAS HEADING
TO ARLENE SHRAM'S HOUSE.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.709
SHE WAS HOPING ARLENE
WOULD GIVE HER A STATEMENT

43:06.709 --> 43:10.750
THAT WOULD LET HER
ARREST YOU.

43:10.750 --> 43:14.542
BUT DEB NEVER MADE IT THERE.

43:14.542 --> 43:17.583
SHE BLACKED OUT
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.250
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

43:25.250 --> 43:27.458
- FAMILIAR?
- SAL PRICE.

43:27.458 --> 43:29.291
IT'S WHAT YOU HOPED
WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM

43:29.291 --> 43:31.709
BEFORE YOU POISONED HIM.

43:34.583 --> 43:39.083
- ARE YOU--

43:39.083 --> 43:40.917
DO YOU THINK THAT I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO

43:40.917 --> 43:45.041
WITH DEBRA'S ACCIDENT?

43:45.041 --> 43:46.333
- DID YOU?

43:46.333 --> 43:48.041
- [exhales]

43:48.041 --> 43:51.417
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
EVEN THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

43:54.041 --> 43:56.000
SAY SOMETHING.
- I KNOW YOU WILL ALWAYS DO

43:56.000 --> 43:58.125
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

43:58.125 --> 43:59.875
- THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE TRYING
TO POISON YOUR SISTER.

43:59.875 --> 44:01.583
- YOU YOURSELF TOLD ME
ARLENE SAW YOU

44:01.583 --> 44:03.625
POISON THAT COUNSELOR'S
COFFEE.

44:03.625 --> 44:05.291
- AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES

44:05.291 --> 44:07.291
I SAW ARLENE SHOOT UP.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.125
I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT
WHAT SHE COULD DO TO ME,

44:09.125 --> 44:13.125
BUT THEN I WENT TO SEE HER
AND...SHE'S A MESS

44:13.125 --> 44:15.250
THAT ANY SECOND-YEAR LAW STUDENT
COULD DISCREDIT.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.583
SHE'S NOT A THREAT TO ME.

44:26.959 --> 44:30.125
- BUT DEB IS.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.834
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD BE THAT STUPID

44:31.834 --> 44:36.583
TO TRY AND POISON
THE LIEUTENANT OF HOMICIDE?

44:36.583 --> 44:40.000
AND TO THINK THAT
YOU WOULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT?

44:40.000 --> 44:43.667
WOULDN'T EXACTLY BRING US
CLOSER TOGETHER, WOULD IT?

44:47.458 --> 44:50.625
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

44:50.625 --> 44:53.125
- YES.

44:53.125 --> 44:56.291
- DO YOU LOVE ME?

44:56.291 --> 44:59.792
- YES.

45:00.917 --> 45:03.959
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I BELIEVE YOU.

45:03.959 --> 45:07.500
- YOU WERE AT HER HOUSE
LAST NIGHT.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.959
- I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE KNEW
HOW MUCH I CARED ABOUT YOU,

45:09.959 --> 45:11.834
THEN SHE WOULD
BACK DOWN A LITTLE.

45:11.834 --> 45:15.834
- BUT SHE NEVER WILL.

45:15.834 --> 45:17.709
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK
WHEN DEB HAS A HEART ATTACK?

45:17.709 --> 45:19.166
- DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

45:19.166 --> 45:21.500
- IF ANYTHING
EVER HAPPENS TO DEB,

45:21.500 --> 45:22.834
I'M GONNA WONDER IF YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

45:22.834 --> 45:25.291
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM--
YOUR LACK OF TRUST.

45:25.291 --> 45:28.125
YOUR INABILITY TO TRUST.

45:28.125 --> 45:31.000
GOD, IT'S LIKE...
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING

45:31.000 --> 45:35.125
DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF YOU THAT YOU
THINK IS UNDESERVING OF LOVE.

45:35.125 --> 45:38.041
- DON'T TURN THIS BACK ON ME.
- YOU'RE THE ONE ACCUSING ME.

45:38.041 --> 45:41.208
- I JU--I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF!

45:47.000 --> 45:50.917
- OKAY, I'M NOT SURE
QUITE HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT...

45:54.375 --> 45:58.625
I'VE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.917
IF I HAD POISONED DEBRA,
THEN SHE WOULD BE DEAD,

46:01.917 --> 46:04.709
AND IF YOU KNOW ME THE WAY
THAT YOU SAY THAT YOU DO,

46:04.709 --> 46:07.041
THEN YOU KNOW
THAT THAT'S TRUE.

46:11.917 --> 46:14.583
- MAYBE IT ALL WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT.

46:17.417 --> 46:18.834
- I KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY SCARY

46:18.834 --> 46:21.125
TO SEE HER IN THE HOSPITAL
LIKE THAT.

46:21.125 --> 46:23.875
- IT WAS.

46:23.875 --> 46:26.417
- AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
THAT YOU WOULD TRY

46:26.417 --> 46:30.542
TO MAKE SENSE OF A SITUATION
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,

46:30.542 --> 46:34.417
BUT YOU'RE DOING THAT AT THE
EXPENSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

46:34.417 --> 46:37.208
- I'M NOT TRYING TO.
I--

46:37.208 --> 46:39.458
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

46:39.458 --> 46:42.291
- I'M SURE ABOUT YOU.

46:42.291 --> 46:44.959
I'M 100% SURE,

46:44.959 --> 46:48.625
BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE
TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT ME.

46:48.625 --> 46:51.583
- I KNOW.

46:53.166 --> 46:56.250
- WE COULD HAVE IT ALL.

47:00.125 --> 47:04.417
I THINK YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.

47:04.417 --> 47:07.625
AND WHAT TYPE OF FUTURE
YOU WANT TO HAVE.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.667
- IT'S RIGHT IN HERE.

48:09.542 --> 48:11.542
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
HUH?

48:11.542 --> 48:13.750
WHERE'S THE STUFF?

48:13.750 --> 48:15.375
[gunshot]

48:15.375 --> 48:19.041
[groaning]

48:24.250 --> 48:28.667
ESTRADA!
ESTRADA.

48:31.208 --> 48:33.542
ESTRADA, IT'S TIME.

48:35.750 --> 48:38.500
I GUESS THE DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS KEPT THAT FOR YOU.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.333
THAT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.

48:41.333 --> 48:45.959
YOU'VE CHANGED A LOT
IN THE PAST 40 YEARS.

48:45.959 --> 48:49.709
SO HAVE I.

48:49.709 --> 48:52.083
THREE MEN MURDERED MY MOTHER.

48:52.083 --> 48:55.917
JUAN PABLO ALISO
WAS SHOT IN ANOTHER DEAL.

48:55.917 --> 48:57.625
SANTOS JIMENEZ.
YOU REMEMBER HIM.

48:57.625 --> 49:01.417
HE TESTIFIED AGAINST YOU.

49:01.417 --> 49:05.667
I CUT HIM INTO SIX ROUGHLY EQUAL
PIECES WITH A CHAIN SAW...

49:05.667 --> 49:07.709
JUST LIKE HE DID MY MOTHER.

49:07.709 --> 49:09.917
JUST LIKE I'M GONNA
DO TO YOU.

49:09.917 --> 49:12.917
- HOLY FUCK!
YOU'RE DICKIE MOSER!

49:12.917 --> 49:15.625
- DEXTER...MOSER.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.333
I AM DEXTER MOSER...

49:25.333 --> 49:27.625
AND I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

49:27.625 --> 49:29.375
- IS THAT WHAT ALL THIS
IS ABOUT?

49:29.375 --> 49:33.583
- I WAS THREE YEARS OLD WHEN YOU
LEFT ME IN THAT CONTAINER.

49:35.333 --> 49:38.417
WHO AM I GONNA BE
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD?

49:38.417 --> 49:42.959
- STILL SOME FUCKING FREAK,
PROBABLY.

49:42.959 --> 49:45.083
- WE'LL SEE.

49:52.208 --> 49:56.875
- HA. YOU'RE WORKING
WITH HER, AREN'T YOU?

49:56.875 --> 49:59.333
- WHAT?

49:59.333 --> 50:01.625
- THAT FUCKING COP BITCH,

50:01.625 --> 50:03.333
THE ONE WHO GOT ME OUT.

50:03.333 --> 50:06.166
OH, YEAH, THEY SAID
THAT THERE WAS A BIG PUSH

50:06.166 --> 50:10.333
FOR MY RELEASE
FROM THE CAPTAIN OF MIAMI METRO.

50:10.333 --> 50:12.875
- LAGUERTA?

50:12.875 --> 50:15.458
- SHE FUCKING SET ME UP.

50:15.458 --> 50:18.667
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO WAS SET UP.

50:18.667 --> 50:20.834
- OFFICER.

50:20.834 --> 50:22.458
- WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HERE,
BUT WE LOST HIM.

50:22.458 --> 50:23.834
UNTIL WE HEARD THE GUNSHOT.

50:23.834 --> 50:26.000
THAT'S WHEN WE CALLED YOU.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.625
- ALL RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE SINCE?

50:27.625 --> 50:29.542
- NO, MA'AM.
- SHOW ME WHERE.

50:37.625 --> 50:42.458
[motor humming]

50:53.291 --> 50:56.083
[humming]

50:56.083 --> 50:58.875
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON IN THIS PLACE?

50:58.875 --> 51:01.041
- KEEP LOOKING FOR ESTRADA
AND ANYONE ELSE WITH HIM.

51:01.041 --> 51:03.083
ESTRADA'S NOT ALONE.

51:03.083 --> 51:06.166
[motor humming]

51:13.583 --> 51:16.166
- [whispering]
DON'T MAKE A FUCKING SOUND.

51:25.625 --> 51:27.875
- AROUND THIS SIDE.

51:27.875 --> 51:29.709
AROUND THE BACK.
- WHICH SIDE?

51:35.709 --> 51:38.625
[distant chatter]

51:42.166 --> 51:44.709
- IT WASN'T THE UNIVERSE
GIVING ME A GIFT.

51:44.709 --> 51:46.875
IT WAS LAGUERTA.

52:06.917 --> 52:09.542
I CAN MAKE SURE AT LEAST
ONE MEMBER OF THE MORGAN FAMILY

52:09.542 --> 52:11.750
HAS A GOOD CHRISTMAS.

52:13.583 --> 52:16.792
[cell phone rings]

52:19.834 --> 52:22.458
YES.
- DEXTER, IT'S SERGIO.

52:22.458 --> 52:24.667
YOU TOLD ME TO CALL YOU WHEN
I RAN THAT WATER YOU BROUGHT IN.

52:24.667 --> 52:27.291
I KNOW IT'S EARLY.
- IT'S OKAY. WHAT'D YOU FIND?

52:27.291 --> 52:29.250
- THAT WATER'S LIKE
40% ALPRAZOLAM.

52:29.250 --> 52:31.291
THAT'S AN ANTIANXIETY DRUG.

52:31.291 --> 52:33.959
SOMEONE MUST HAVE REALLY WANTED
TO KNOCK THEMSELVES OUT.

52:33.959 --> 52:37.959
BUT THIS TIME OF YEAR,
WHO CAN BLAME 'EM?

52:37.959 --> 52:39.959
- THANKS.
- YOU GOT IT.

52:42.458 --> 52:44.291
- IT WAS NO ACCIDENT.

52:44.291 --> 52:46.709
HANNAH DISSOLVED THE PILLS
INTO DEB'S WATER

52:46.709 --> 52:50.166
SO THAT SHE'D PASS OUT
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

52:50.166 --> 52:54.500
A PROBLEM
IN HANNAH'S LIFE SOLVED.

52:54.500 --> 52:57.959
HANNAH POISONED DEBRA.

52:57.959 --> 53:01.583
IT'S NOT THE FUTURE
I HAD WANTED WITH HANNAH...

53:01.583 --> 53:04.375
BUT MAYBE IT'S WHAT I DESERVE.

53:16.792 --> 53:20.625
- YOU BARELY SAID TWO WORDS
ON THE RIDE HOME.

53:25.917 --> 53:29.083
- I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

53:29.083 --> 53:31.291
- A PRESENT?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.834
A NEW CAR, I HOPE.

53:35.917 --> 53:38.208
- I GUESS IT'S A PRESENT.

53:39.959 --> 53:44.166
IT'S SAL PRICE'S PEN.

53:44.166 --> 53:45.542
IF YOU TEST IT,

53:45.542 --> 53:48.709
YOU'LL FIND TRACES
OF ACONITE ON THE END...

53:48.709 --> 53:51.542
AND HANNAH'S PRINTS.

53:54.041 --> 53:56.083
- SO THAT'S HOW SHE DID IT.

53:56.083 --> 53:58.250
- [exhales]

54:03.542 --> 54:07.250
I FOUND IT THE NEXT MORNING.
I KEPT IT OUT OF EVIDENCE.

54:09.375 --> 54:12.333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA TURN HER IN.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.875
