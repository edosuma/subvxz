THE NEW POPE
Episode 3

02:03.000 --> 02:05.360
- Do you know what it is?
- It's a millipede.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.560
No. It's God.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.280
- Mum and Dad are looking for us.
- We can't go back now.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.200
- Why not?
- Because we're watching God, John.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.880
- Sir John, they are in a hurry.
- I'm not.

02:27.920 --> 02:34.000
"In a higher world it is otherwise,
but here below, to live is to change

02:34.880 --> 02:38.000
and to be perfect
is to have changed often."

02:38.520 --> 02:40.920
You're a devious one, Danny.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.680
Ensnaring me with the words
of my beloved Newman.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.800
We should only take Valencia.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.240
And the box.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.880
You were right as always, Danny,
she is splendid.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.240
It's Megan, Sir.
She does not know what to wear.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.360
What a nyusance!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.680
Tell her I'll phone her later.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.400
That's not enough!

04:10.400 --> 04:12.320
We'll have to go to the higher ups.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.640
You're throwing me out.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.399
Where are Pius and I suppose
to go now? On the street?

04:20.959 --> 04:24.360
I'm not throwing you out, Ester.
The owner is.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.400
Thanks to me, you have been living
here, ever since Peter left you.

04:29.280 --> 04:33.680
But the owner wants his house back.
He has rights, too, doesn't he?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.120
I can start paying rent again.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.480
The Italian Swiss TV is doing a show
on Pius XIII's miracles, and I...

04:40.800 --> 04:45.920
Ester, you can't live off the odd
TV appearance. You need a steady job.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.760
I clean your church.
That's a steady job.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.760
But it's only two hours a day Ester.
Not enough to get by on.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.320
- I can look for another cleaning job.
- And what will you do with Pius?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.320
Who's going to watch him
while you're in Rome?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.640
So, what am I supposed to do now?

05:06.920 --> 05:08.840
You need another miracle, Ester.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.800
You've all abandoned me.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.120
Even you, Lenny.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.560
- Marvelous but dated.
- Like me.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.960
My favourite famous people
are Dennis Hopper,

06:49.360 --> 06:53.280
Jack Nicholson, Sean Penn,
Sharon Stone and...

06:54.800 --> 06:58.160
- Marilyn Manson.
- What do you like about them?

06:58.560 --> 07:01.840
- They seem free.
- And you like liberty?

07:02.080 --> 07:04.840
You know the answer.
Don't ask such obvious questions.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.840
If you become pope, liberty is the one
outfit you won't be able to wear.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.920
- Will I be able to see you every day?
- Don't ask such obvious questions.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.040
You remind me of my favourite actor:
John Malkovich.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.720
He doesn't do much for me.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.560
The others, if I were to become Pope,
might I be able to meet them?

07:31.960 --> 07:37.360
All, except Dennis Hopper. There
shouldn't be any problem for the others.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.360
It's considered an honor
to meet the pontiff.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.920
Finally! A sensible reason
for inspiring to the papacy.

07:48.240 --> 07:53.080
I found a photograph in my room,
tucked in a draw of you with the Queen.

07:58.280 --> 08:03.480
And you are implying what?
That I put it there to impress you?

08:04.360 --> 08:05.800
I'm getting old.

08:06.320 --> 08:11.880
And old age perhaps pushes us
to employ these pathetic little tricks.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.040
- What's she like? The queen?
- Enchanting.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.840
Because she is pale.
Like you.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.760
Hello.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.800
Yes, wear the yellow Dior.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.840
Because it plays up the contrast
with your complexion.

08:36.960 --> 08:43.039
No. No, Megan. I'm adamant.
Wear the yellow Dior, I said.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.280
- Was that Megan?
- Regrettably yes.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.680
They want to be "influencers", yet they
have no idea of color combinations.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.120
She calls me 25 times a day
for beauty tips. She thinks I'm gay.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.452
Well...

09:06.840 --> 09:08.040
Are you?

09:53.080 --> 09:56.080
Did you hear
about the attack in Somalia?

09:56.880 --> 09:58.560
I'm devastated.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.880
- Do you find me bombastic?
- Not at all.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.400
And yet that is precisely what I am.
Bombast has been a defect

10:10.480 --> 10:14.920
which I simply cannot seem to control
like all Anglo-Saxons.

10:16.120 --> 10:21.000
On the news, they said they may have
used a boy to carry out the attack.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.680
I know.
And I am not, in fact, devastated.

10:25.760 --> 10:30.120
Nor I am experiencing the least bit
of guilt over my lack of feelings.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.800
Africa is far away.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.720
Perhaps you are committed to suffering
only for those who are close to you.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.120
I am aware of the opinion
you've formed of me, Gutierrez.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.360
You think I am a socialite.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.480
Socializing is important.
Think how many remarkable things

10:59.600 --> 11:02.000
happened for Jesus
during the Last Supper.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.200
That was a social event.

11:17.240 --> 11:21.400
Were I'd come to Rome,
I should like to be your friend as well.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.560
It would be an honor
and a pleasure for me.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.600
I should tell you something,
straight away, as a friend.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.360
My parents charted
a great ecclesiastical career

11:42.520 --> 11:44.560
for my brother Adam
but not for me.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.840
They told to me every day of my life
that I'd never amount to anything.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.120
Why were they so mean?

11:57.200 --> 12:01.440
We are not yet good enough friends
for me to tell you that, Bernardo.

12:32.400 --> 12:37.400
I have only come here to tell you
that I, John Brannox,

12:38.240 --> 12:40.280
may be the next pope of Rome.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.360
I know you've always thought
that it was Adam's destiny.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.480
But it seems that maybe mine.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.440
Even though this was the last thing
you would ever wish for,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.400
you shall be condemned
to be proud of me,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.560
you poor old bastards.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.520
God doesn't like you.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.440
All my life,
I have negated myself,

13:22.560 --> 13:26.760
in the pathetic attempt
to alleviate your suffering.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.560
To no avail!

13:29.200 --> 13:33.840
I became my brother in the hopes
of bringing a smile to your faces.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.960
Even just once.
To no avail.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.840
But now, it all makes sense.

13:42.760 --> 13:47.320
For it has served to make me pope.
Me, not Adam!

13:48.120 --> 13:49.360
I will be pope

13:50.880 --> 13:57.080
and I will continue to forsake myself
as I've done for you for these years.

13:58.680 --> 14:03.320
Only now I will be doing
for all the Catholics in the world.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.920
For that is what love means to me:
forsaking myself.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.920
You're the ones who taught me that,
hating me every day.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.200
And so, after living my life

14:24.760 --> 14:29.440
in the service of my mother,
my father, my brother,

14:30.040 --> 14:34.840
and receiving nothing but contempt,
I should now live my life

14:35.440 --> 14:39.000
in the service of the Church
and its people,

14:39.840 --> 14:44.520
hoping to receive, for the first time,
an ounce of affection.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.800
I can be pope.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.920
Because I know
how to endure suffering.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.320
Others don't.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.800
You're going too slow.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.720
Nearly there.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.040
John, I'm done!

15:45.440 --> 15:49.600
Adam, I am nothing
but falsehood and vanity;

15:49.760 --> 15:51.800
the armor I wear,
to hide the truth.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.600
I only suffer
for what is close to me.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.600
How true!
I only suffer for you, Adam.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.080
I let our family die.
Nothing else matters.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.400
Nothing touches me.
Everything disgusts me.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.000
Which is why God
does not like me.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.320
God didn't like me either.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.720
Because God's love
is not simply given.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.520
You have to earn it, step by step.
You have to grow.

16:32.440 --> 16:37.240
Are you ready to take the first step?
Are you ready to grow up?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.839
Please, come in.
Make yourselves comfortable.

17:13.720 --> 17:18.680
I wanted to see you, in order
to tell you something in person.

17:21.118 --> 17:24.319
I have decided
to decline your proposal.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.520
I have no intention whatsoever of being
your candidate at the conclave.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.600
May I ask why?

17:33.680 --> 17:39.520
Because, despite appearances,
I am not equal to the task.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.240
Your sincerity and humility

17:44.040 --> 17:47.440
will be greatly appreciated
by the College of Cardinals.

17:48.680 --> 17:53.880
And by the faithful the world over.
God will help you, Sir John.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.640
- Only He is equal to the task.
- Yes.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.520
I have decided not to choose.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.120
Not choosing being the only thing
at which I truly excel.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.600
We are out of time...
We have to get to Rome immediately.

18:16.080 --> 18:21.040
Tomorrow is pope Francis II's funeral,
the world is waiting.

18:21.600 --> 18:26.800
Voiello, why don't you take a step back
and let Hernandez be elected?

18:28.120 --> 18:31.000
That seems like
the most reasonable plan, Eminence.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.320
You could certainly reach an agreement
that satisfies both of you.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.680
Hernandez would gladly
reconfirm you as Secretary of State

18:38.760 --> 18:40.320
in order to be elected pope.

18:41.160 --> 18:45.720
Hernandez covered up
all the sexual abuse in his dioceses.

18:46.840 --> 18:51.000
Did you know that?
No, no you didn't. But I did.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.640
I spend my life
gathering information.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.240
Hernandez will never be pope
as long as I live.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.400
Moreover, we have only one candidate,
that is Sir John Brannox.

19:03.920 --> 19:09.400
A piece of fragile porcelain,
but consequently without sin.

19:09.680 --> 19:15.920
I am not a piece of fragile porcelain,
I am a man of steel laden with sins,

19:16.760 --> 19:22.160
but I also possess
unimaginable powers of persuasion.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.520
Now, look at those two roses.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.160
Do you notice anything?

19:32.440 --> 19:34.760
Flowers are vain.

19:38.683 --> 19:41.643
Sir John, I wanted to say goodbye

19:42.243 --> 19:46.323
and to thank you for the marvelous
hospitality you have shown us.

19:46.923 --> 19:49.123
Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

19:49.803 --> 19:51.083
When do you leave?

19:51.243 --> 19:55.163
Tomorrow morning, bright and early.
The conclave awaits!

19:55.563 --> 20:00.363
You will forgive me for not attending,
won't you? I am quite done in.

20:00.963 --> 20:06.083
But of course. It is not a problem.
Your vote would be superfluous.

20:06.963 --> 20:11.723
Fortunately, we have unanimously
converged on a new candidate.

20:12.843 --> 20:15.643
Needless to say,
we are all greatly relieved.

20:16.283 --> 20:19.043
I am delighted
that the matter has been resolved,

20:19.123 --> 20:23.843
and that my reticence would not present
a problem for the future of our Church.

20:24.403 --> 20:28.723
Not at all. The Holy Spirit
has illumined us once again.

20:29.523 --> 20:31.883
And the Church
will continue on its way.

20:33.443 --> 20:36.483
Goodbye Voiello.
It's a great pleasure meeting you.

20:38.123 --> 20:40.283
The pleasure was mine, Sir John.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.523
Eminence!

20:53.683 --> 20:59.203
I was... I was wondering,
pure curiosity on my part,

20:59.883 --> 21:05.483
what is the name of the cardinal upon
whom you all unanimously converge?

21:07.043 --> 21:09.483
Count Francois De Bougainville.

21:12.483 --> 21:14.603
- Norman nobility.
- Exactly.

21:16.403 --> 21:17.723
Goodbye, Sir John.

21:26.923 --> 21:29.563
Just a minute!

21:35.403 --> 21:40.523
Valencia suffers from car sickness.
You won't mind if he rides in the front?

22:08.163 --> 22:11.203
Whenever you are unsure
which choice to make,

22:11.443 --> 22:13.803
if you wish,
I am here to help you.

22:14.363 --> 22:17.603
Agreed. By the way, Eminence,
last night I was looking

22:17.763 --> 22:22.603
for the name Francois de Bougainville
in the account pontifical yearbook.

22:23.003 --> 22:28.603
- But it wasn't there. Why not?
- Because he died six years ago.

22:29.843 --> 22:31.403
What a rascal you are!

22:37.683 --> 22:39.843
What will Megan do without me?

24:58.795 --> 25:02.355
- Is your son the birthday boy?
- Yes, Pius.

25:06.635 --> 25:10.395
Will you forgive me
for having come without a present?

25:11.395 --> 25:12.635
Of course.

25:12.755 --> 25:15.755
When my wife, wife was alive,
this never would have happened.

25:18.155 --> 25:20.995
I've heard, I'm sorry.

25:23.435 --> 25:24.635
It was God's will.

25:31.795 --> 25:32.955
What do you do?

25:35.995 --> 25:40.235
Mine is an ancient,
useless profession:

25:41.875 --> 25:42.995
I repair watches.

25:44.355 --> 25:45.515
Why useless?

25:47.115 --> 25:49.675
Because no one repairs
anything any more.

25:50.755 --> 25:52.555
They just replace everything.

25:54.475 --> 25:56.715
Not everything
is replaceable, though.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.675
- Might I ask you a favor?
- Of course.

26:08.755 --> 26:12.315
Would you be so kind as to keep
an eye on my son Marcellino?

26:14.075 --> 26:15.675
I need to leave for a moment.

26:18.195 --> 26:19.435
Where are you going?

26:23.035 --> 26:25.515
I need to see the sunset.

28:00.755 --> 28:02.635
Do you remember me,
Holy Father?

28:06.275 --> 28:10.595
I do, yes.
You were enthusiastic and ambitious.

28:12.835 --> 28:14.035
I haven't changed.

28:27.195 --> 28:28.395
I knew you'd come.

28:30.315 --> 28:34.955
- How did you know?
- Because we're so alone, Ester.

29:12.915 --> 29:15.395
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

29:18.475 --> 29:22.675
I look upon you
and I see a hidden grace,

29:24.195 --> 29:25.435
which is a truth.

29:26.715 --> 29:28.315
That is what you are.

29:30.915 --> 29:36.515
You look upon me and you see
a fragile old man with a beard.

29:37.315 --> 29:39.235
That is what I am.

29:41.835 --> 29:43.155
Now you are thinking:

29:43.475 --> 29:46.715
so this is the pope,
the new bishop of Rome!

29:47.555 --> 29:49.195
He must know so much!

29:50.635 --> 29:55.395
No! That is not true.
I do not know.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.995
That is why I want to learn.

30:00.755 --> 30:04.875
Let us learn together,
brothers and sisters.

30:05.035 --> 30:10.755
Me, here, in my new home,
and you, together with your families.

30:12.435 --> 30:16.955
We must never forget the beauty
and the strength of family.

30:17.715 --> 30:20.435
Whenever we cannot manage
to see the beauty,

30:20.915 --> 30:23.915
it is because
the truth has been hidden.

30:25.275 --> 30:30.555
Let us uncover that truth,
place it on the kitchen table

30:31.155 --> 30:33.795
and your family
will grow stronger.

30:34.755 --> 30:36.235
That is who you are.

30:38.635 --> 30:42.475
And let us try
to eliminate prejudices.

30:43.675 --> 30:48.155
Those who have prejudices
do not know the facts.

30:48.595 --> 30:50.315
That is not who you are.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.715
Let us grow in the tenderness
of our intimacy

30:57.115 --> 30:59.835
and in the intimacy
of our tenderness.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.435
That is who you are.

31:04.275 --> 31:08.395
And do not think,
brothers and sisters,

31:08.915 --> 31:10.475
we must not think.

31:11.635 --> 31:13.755
The Church must not think.

31:15.275 --> 31:18.275
It needs only to protect the fragile.

31:19.915 --> 31:25.755
Our mission is to recognize,
preserve and value fragility.

31:26.515 --> 31:31.515
That fragility which hides
in the opaque cold of night

31:31.875 --> 31:34.715
or in the crystalline cold of midday.

31:35.875 --> 31:40.755
Wherever there is fragility,
there is the Church.

31:42.035 --> 31:43.515
That is who we are.

31:46.155 --> 31:47.595
We are a truth.

31:59.515 --> 32:03.155
I ran back to my shop
and I found the perfect gift for Pius,

32:03.875 --> 32:07.835
in the bottom of a drawer;
a client forgot it a year ago.

32:10.155 --> 32:11.315
You shouldn't have.

32:12.395 --> 32:17.075
And yet, deep down,
I sensed that I should.

33:38.635 --> 33:40.835
Look what a fabulous gift
I have for you!

33:41.115 --> 33:46.075
Two fifth-row tickets for the musical
on the last judgment at the Sistina.

33:46.835 --> 33:51.835
- A musical in the Sistine Chapel?
- No, at the Theater Sistina.

33:52.995 --> 33:55.755
Father, we are cloistered nuns.

33:57.515 --> 33:58.795
How silly of me!

34:00.315 --> 34:03.355
I keep forgetting that you
can't leave the premises.

34:04.795 --> 34:07.155
So, you didn't come
to ask about the musical?

34:07.595 --> 34:11.755
We came because Sister Lisette's
mother has cancer, stage IV.

34:12.554 --> 34:15.436
Her dying wish is to go to Lourdes
with her daughter.

34:15.676 --> 34:20.594
The sisters took up a collection,
but we only have 90 euro.

34:20.875 --> 34:24.074
- We need 200 more.
- Absolutely.

34:24.755 --> 34:27.395
This is a question
of the highest priority.

34:28.755 --> 34:30.235
But...

34:30.395 --> 34:34.355
but I want to be honest
with you, though:

34:35.514 --> 34:37.916
the Vatican, as you certainly know,

34:38.835 --> 34:42.196
is in the midst
of a profound financial crisis

34:43.074 --> 34:46.835
and all the offices
have been ordered to rein in their,

34:47.635 --> 34:51.275
what shall we say,
extravagant expenses.

34:52.275 --> 34:57.114
Does this seem
like an extravagant expense to you?

34:58.595 --> 35:03.515
An extravagant expense is the Bentley
that Cardinal Spalletta is driving.

35:21.156 --> 35:26.035
I shall personally see to your request
as soon as possible, Sisters.

35:31.956 --> 35:33.756
I don't believe him one word!

37:11.201 --> 37:15.081
- That's it Holy Father. We're done.
- What? No nudes?

37:25.507 --> 37:26.907
Have you lost your minds?

37:27.547 --> 37:30.467
The cardinals are on their way
to the Sistine Chapel.

37:30.547 --> 37:34.067
- The pope is going to address them.
- We want to talk with Voiello.

37:34.267 --> 37:37.387
- I have already spoken with him.
- Why didn't you tell us?

37:37.467 --> 37:41.187
- What were you waiting for?
- I was waiting for the right time.

37:41.947 --> 37:45.627
- And when might that be?
- When it is the right time.

37:47.307 --> 37:48.427
Voiello!

37:52.827 --> 37:54.227
Voiello!

38:02.347 --> 38:05.587
It frightens me
to think what I am for you,

38:06.947 --> 38:09.747
but what I am with you
consoles me.

38:10.027 --> 38:16.187
For you, I am the Bishop of Rome,
with you, I am a Christian.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.427
Welcome, brother cardinals.

38:22.667 --> 38:26.267
We only have one problem.
I don't know of any other.

38:28.227 --> 38:29.467
The problem is love.

38:31.067 --> 38:35.547
You will come to me and you will say:
Holy Father, idolatry is taking root

38:35.667 --> 38:38.587
in the form of a cult
devoted to Pius XIII,

38:38.907 --> 38:42.787
there are worrisome currents
of terrorism at work within Islam,

38:43.107 --> 38:46.667
depressing business
concerns weighing on the Curia,

38:47.507 --> 38:53.507
aberrations of sexual behavior,
crises of work and ethics,

38:54.187 --> 38:58.147
men who murder women,
women who murder their children.

38:59.747 --> 39:04.827
You will come to me and you will
tell me all this suffering in the world.

39:05.067 --> 39:10.147
And I will say to you:
they are all hysterias of love.

39:11.987 --> 39:15.147
Distortions of our ability to love.

39:17.467 --> 39:19.507
The problem, brothers, is love.

39:19.907 --> 39:25.467
The question, then, is:
how are we to love?

39:27.027 --> 39:33.187
This is my way:
with tenderness, without passion.

39:35.787 --> 39:39.907
Passion is the eternal enemy
of humility.

39:41.827 --> 39:45.307
Christian humility, which is frugal,

39:46.347 --> 39:48.907
is just and is necessary.

39:52.347 --> 39:57.227
Love is an abstraction,
like intelligence, like happiness.

39:58.467 --> 40:05.227
Every time our judgment is beclouded
by the ardent passions that consume us,

40:06.347 --> 40:11.827
we give love a dangerous concreteness,
a scandalous concreteness,

40:12.187 --> 40:14.467
an illegal concreteness.

40:15.107 --> 40:19.267
In short, we are causing pain.

40:20.387 --> 40:23.787
To ourselves, and to others.

40:26.587 --> 40:30.587
Replace that concrete love
with tenderness.

40:34.227 --> 40:39.027
Or else, my beloved brothers,
to my deep regret,

40:41.627 --> 40:43.987
I shall be force to replace you.

40:46.427 --> 40:49.267
God does not want that.

40:50.787 --> 40:54.427
Only God knows hows
right and necessary

40:55.027 --> 40:57.787
it is for our Church
to remain united.

40:58.307 --> 41:01.267
Jesus explained to us what love is,

41:02.307 --> 41:06.507
but we do not have his equilibrium,
nor his wisdom,

41:06.747 --> 41:10.627
but, we must try,
my brothers, together.

41:12.107 --> 41:16.427
I can be a father to you,
but you must know

41:17.667 --> 41:23.027
that fathers are to be obeyed
even when they make mistakes.

41:27.467 --> 41:33.387
My beloved cardinals, perhaps
we cannot fully express our faith

41:33.787 --> 41:37.507
but we can express
our tenderness.

41:38.667 --> 41:42.467
It is our hope
and our ambition.

41:52.227 --> 41:53.387
Where will you go?

41:56.747 --> 42:00.227
Don Mario is going to let us sleep
in the sacristy for a few days.

42:02.347 --> 42:04.387
After that, I have no idea.

42:06.227 --> 42:07.987
Why can't we come stay with you?

42:08.827 --> 42:14.427
Because it would be an unbearable
trauma for little Marcellino.

42:14.947 --> 42:18.627
He still has not gotten
over the loss of his mother...

42:18.707 --> 42:19.907
Okay, I get it!

42:24.227 --> 42:27.947
I might have
a way of resolving things.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.067
What are you saying?

42:39.507 --> 42:44.507
A while back,
in my old parish in Santa Marinella,

42:45.427 --> 42:46.627
I met a lady,

42:47.947 --> 42:50.067
very distinguished,
she is a lawyer.

42:52.307 --> 42:54.867
Anyway, we became friends.

42:57.467 --> 43:01.587
She is very wealthy,
but she has a problem.

43:03.947 --> 43:05.267
What sort of problem?

43:08.427 --> 43:09.547
Her son.

43:10.947 --> 43:15.067
- He has serious physical deformities.
- What sort of deformities?

43:16.307 --> 43:20.667
I really don't know exactly.
He never takes him out in public.

43:21.707 --> 43:24.707
She keeps him holed up in her villa,
confined to a room.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.827
Maybe she is ashamed of him.

43:32.147 --> 43:33.787
Why are you telling me this?

43:36.667 --> 43:38.027
Because she has money.

43:40.427 --> 43:42.547
And money is what you need.

43:44.227 --> 43:48.107
And she is looking for a caregiver?
Okay, here I am.

43:51.747 --> 43:55.547
No. No, Ester sorry,
she is not looking for a caregiver.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.347
No...

43:59.187 --> 44:00.787
What she is looking for then?

44:06.747 --> 44:11.627
She would like to lavishly reward
an act of generosity,

44:12.947 --> 44:15.747
which a pretty girl
could do for her poor son.

44:17.147 --> 44:22.627
Her son is 20 and for obvious reasons
he has never been with a woman.

44:29.307 --> 44:30.387
I'm sorry Ester.

44:31.107 --> 44:34.227
Let's forget about it
and never mention it again, right?

44:35.667 --> 44:36.787
Sorry!

44:42.947 --> 44:45.427
Go to sleep, my baby.
Go to sleep!

45:06.987 --> 45:08.827
What would I have to do, exactly?

45:11.067 --> 45:13.787
Would it be enough
if I let him see me naked?

45:16.987 --> 45:21.667
No. He sees naked women
all day long on the Internet.

45:23.347 --> 45:24.947
No that wouldn't be enough.

45:28.747 --> 45:31.107
How much
would his mother willing to pay?

45:34.467 --> 45:35.627
I don't know.

45:36.707 --> 45:40.347
15, maybe 20000.
She is very rich!

45:46.347 --> 45:48.747
No, that would be prostitution.
It's a sin.

45:48.827 --> 45:53.547
No, it is not a sin.
Because it is not prostitution.

45:55.987 --> 45:59.547
- It is an act of Christian charity.
- No, it's a sin!

46:03.587 --> 46:05.987
Then his future
is worth more than your sin.

46:07.827 --> 46:09.867
Father, what do you think?

46:12.467 --> 46:14.467
I think you are a lucky woman, Ester.

46:15.267 --> 46:17.827
This is the second miracle
God has granted you.

47:00.987 --> 47:03.027
- What's your name?
- Faisal.

47:03.667 --> 47:05.027
You?

47:06.387 --> 47:07.627
Caterina.
