- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- <i>Okay, one, two, three, jump.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:07.997
<i>Twenty-seven people</i>
<i>sailed away from this dock,</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.624
<i>they were looking forward</i>
<i>to a great day together</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:13.297
<i>when suddenly things took</i>
<i>a turn for the worse.</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:14.464
<i>High drama at sea.</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:17.885
<i>A shark cage dive exhibition</i>
<i>was capsized earlier today.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.554
<i>Dumping everyone into the chilly waters.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:22.883
<i>An urgent search</i>
<i>and rescue mission is underway</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:26.686
<i>after a shark dive boat</i>
<i>was capsized by a freak wave</i>

02:26.772 --> 02:28.604
<i>off the South Australian coast.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:30.977
Leaving passengers and crew stranded

02:31.068 --> 02:33.060
in shark infested waters.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.894
<i>An unsuspecting group of tourists</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:37.651
<i>and an experienced shark cage diving crew</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:42.452
<i>headed out today for what was supposed</i>
<i>to be a routine and fun day trip.</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:48.492
<i>The dive site had been baited to attract</i>
<i>great white sharks,</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:51.168
<i>some up to 19 feet in length.</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:55.756
<i>No one could possibly predict</i>
<i>what was to happen next.</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:58.084
Eyewitness accounts indicate that the boat

02:58.178 --> 03:00.921
was hit by some kind of a freak wave.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.676
<i>In the middle of their cage dive,</i>

03:02.766 --> 03:05.474
<i>rough seas struck, washing everyone on board</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:07.222
<i>into shark infested waters,</i>

03:07.312 --> 03:10.601
<i>this time without the protection of a cage.</i>

03:11.775 --> 03:15.894
In a second, we saw this big wave coming.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.355
<i>Among the people missing are</i>
<i>three friends from California.</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:23.819
<i>Police and rescuers are holding out hope</i>
<i>they can still be found alive.</i>

03:23.912 --> 03:28.657
<i>We will find those missing persons</i>
<i>and bring them safely to shore.</i>

03:45.892 --> 03:48.259
Let's go and find some treasure, shall we?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.817
<i>I've been diving here in Australia now</i>
<i>for the last 10 years.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:58.144
<i>Went with a few friends.</i>
<i>We all went to Adelaide.</i>

04:01.283 --> 04:04.151
And I'm just having a nice dive.
My buddies are elsewhere...

04:05.287 --> 04:09.452
<i>I was following a couple of</i>
<i>tropical fish and I saw something.</i>

04:10.459 --> 04:11.825
<i>I was amazed.</i>

04:11.918 --> 04:12.954
It was a camera and I think,

04:13.044 --> 04:16.128
"What's a camera doing down on the ocean
10, 20Ks out from the shore?"

04:17.507 --> 04:19.123
What have we got?

04:19.216 --> 04:20.798
Told ya we'd find something.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.548
I opened it up, had a look,

04:22.637 --> 04:26.677
<i>and the SD card had been preserved.</i>

04:26.767 --> 04:30.764
I put it into my computer, started
looking through some of the footage

04:30.854 --> 04:34.018
and, uh, there was three American people.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.932
- There we go.
- Hey.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.313
- Dude, this looks sweet.
- Good quality?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.769
Yeah, it'll be perfect, bro.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.071
- Does it make me look good?
- Yeah, you look wonderful.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.864
This has got a photo function here.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.067
- Fabio, why don't you give me a pose?
- Oh, yeah?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.619
Hold on. Everybody, hold on.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.162
This isn't a movie, man.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.285
This is the one that got Megan.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.367
Don't worry, folks,
he's only my half-brother.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.792
That's why you're only half.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.623
Here take this, joker.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.424
What are you going to do for us?

05:02.511 --> 05:06.050
I don't have to do anything, Jeffery.
I ooze excellence.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.471
Hey, cool shirt, dude.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.049
This is my go to Australia shirt.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.011
- That'd be good for the surface cages.
- Is that deep enough?

05:13.104 --> 05:16.814
Well, the cage dive is,
like, it's a surface cage dive.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.812
Not very deep.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.484
Oh, dude, I left the tub running.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.482
This battery's pretty low.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.983
Yeah, I know. I haven't charged it yet.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.487
Whoa, it's going to over flow!

05:26.576 --> 05:28.659
When did you start the bath? Yesterday?

05:28.745 --> 05:32.989
- All right, we ready? Here we go.
- Okay.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.579
- Yo!
- Hey!

05:39.673 --> 05:41.084
All right.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.381
We're in here.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.959
- Hey, you look nice.
- Hi.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.423
Oh, you got a new camera! It's really good.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.554
- It works perfect.
- Awesome, cool.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.101
Hey, did you hear from Greg yet?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.678
Is he cool with picking us up
from the airport?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.889
He is, that he is. He emailed this morning.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.191
All right, well, I got back from work
and I need to shower.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.234
You guys need to vamoose.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.186
Oh, do you need a hand or...

06:04.281 --> 06:05.271
No, I'm okay.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.690
- I'm rolling.
- Okay.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.892
GUTS & GLORY NEW REALITY
GAME SHOW APPLY NOW

06:42.986 --> 06:44.067
- So here's our show, guys.
- Oh, no.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.404
What I've been talking about is
an extreme and intense reality game show

06:47.490 --> 06:49.903
- looking for crazy people.
- Crazy people.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.074
I thought you guys would fit right in.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.744
- Oh, look, 100,000 dude.
- I told you so, right?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.071
Are you serious?

06:55.165 --> 06:57.452
Yeah, we're gonna have fun
and it's going to make us rich.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.410
Step one, we make a seven
minute audition tape.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.620
Why we work together good as a team

07:02.714 --> 07:04.421
and why they should choose us.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.624
And so then I'll edit it
together and we'll upload it,

07:06.718 --> 07:08.960
but it's pretty much as simple as that.
I'll take care of it.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.091
There you go, baby brother, get your pump on.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.717
Rocky it.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.642
Okay, let's set up.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.766
Hey, how you doing? My name's Josh.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.440
- And I'm Jeff.
- And I'm Megan, and we're from...

07:23.526 --> 07:26.269
Laguna Beach, California.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.695
USA.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.898
- Yeah!
- USA.

07:29.991 --> 07:30.947
There we go.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.115
- All right, did we get that?
- There it is.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.945
Framing out, getting on camera here.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.372
Our next stop.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.790
The star of our little adventure, Jeffery.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.040
- What are you doing?
- I'm capturing B-roll,

07:43.129 --> 07:44.336
that's what they call it in the business.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.129
Just capturing moments, buddy.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.258
Well, it said in the application that
you can't have a medical condition,

07:49.344 --> 07:51.301
so you might wanna delete that.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.220
That's something I did not know.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.548
- I can do that.
- Shh! Shut up.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.141
We're going to take you on
our journey from California

08:01.231 --> 08:04.645
all the way to Sydney, Australia.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.975
Where we're going to meet our cousin, Greg.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.856
There he is. Handsome looking guy.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.989
And then, we're going to travel to Adelaide

08:12.075 --> 08:15.989
to film our most extreme activity yet.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.617
Shark cage diving! Check it out.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.448
Here it is.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.579
Look at the size of that frickin' shark.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.671
Look how close they get.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.433
Oh, my God!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.933
- Oh...
- You are such a jerk.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.356
Why would you do that?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.274
How are you going to handle the sharks?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.397
I can't even handle my coffee.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.447
I found out that they were
trying to make an audition tape.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.492
I thought, "I'll post some
of these on social media."

08:56.578 --> 08:59.696
<i>See if I can find the owner of this SD card,</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:01.451
<i>send it back to them.</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:25.346
You get that, Josh?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.186
Oh, for me?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.697
- I love this spot.
- Yeah.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.159
Remember when we had our
first date here three years ago?

09:46.252 --> 09:49.211
That's why I brought you
back here on this beautiful night.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.334
That's why I'm getting it on film.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.541
Sometimes you're romantic.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.924
You're terrible with that.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.634
Oh, I like this.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.438
So you going to turn the camera off?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.194
Hmm?

10:18.868 --> 10:21.076
Just after I take off your panties.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.035
Turn it off. Turn it off.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.121
Okay.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.170
<i>KLSE FM in HD Los Angeles.</i>

10:31.256 --> 10:32.792
Have you got everything?

10:32.882 --> 10:36.341
Please, both of you,
now be really careful when you dive.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.259
- Promise me.
- We will.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.929
- Please.
- Always.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.347
Don't miss your flight.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.140
You got my bags, baby?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.469
- Yup.
- And watch your medication.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.600
- Okay, yes, yes.
- I know, I know.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.931
I already showed you I have them.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.724
I love you.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.310
- Bye mom.
- Be really careful.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.645
Love you.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.821
Josh, please watch him.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.566
Okay, we got to go. We got to go.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.242
We're gonna miss the plane, come on.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.614
Farewell, California.
You have treated us well.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.795
<i>I got an email from my cousin, Josh,</i>
<i>and he said that Jeff</i>

11:16.885 --> 11:20.799
and his girlfriend, Megan, were
going to come over to Australia.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.552
<i>We haven't seen each</i>
<i>other since we were kids.</i>

11:23.641 --> 11:26.054
Hello!

11:26.144 --> 11:28.181
Where are you going, Jeff?

11:28.271 --> 11:31.105
Greg, Greg come over here. Come here.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.309
Look, these are your cousins from America.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.815
<i>So I was like this is great.</i>

11:36.905 --> 11:39.898
This is my chance to reconnect.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.155
We just arrived in Sydney, Australia.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.327
We're about to meet Greg.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.536
Like they've never been apart.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.039
- Welcome to Australia.
- Thank you, thank you.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.996
Oh, he comes on strong. I love it.

11:56.174 --> 11:59.133
Let's go, let's rock and roll.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.177
We are....

12:03.681 --> 12:05.217
Wow.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.062
<i>I just wanted to get</i>
<i>into having some fun times.</i>

12:12.148 --> 12:15.437
I just wanted them,
while they are here in Australia to,

12:15.526 --> 12:17.483
you know, fall in love.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.362
Are you ready? Are you ready?

12:20.448 --> 12:23.816
- Are you serious?
- Here we are.

12:23.910 --> 12:24.900
What?

12:26.663 --> 12:28.199
Are you kidding me?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.655
Hi.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.160
Uncle Pablo.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.119
And this is Josh.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.795
- Do you remember him?
- Josh, Josh.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.213
- Pablo...
- Little Josh.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.178
I'm going to put you on that island

12:52.272 --> 12:53.808
for a couple of days
and see if you can survive.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.105
Dude, I would love that.

13:28.975 --> 13:33.060
What is a pirate's favorite letter?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.136
"R"!

13:34.230 --> 13:36.187
You think it'd be, but it'll be the "C".

13:59.213 --> 14:01.205
Don't eat me!

14:07.513 --> 14:09.550
Me, Josh, and Jeff are up on there

14:09.640 --> 14:12.804
and Megan's in the water, completely alone.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.307
All right, guys, I'm ready. Go for it.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.347
Okay, go.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.524
Three, two, one!

14:23.946 --> 14:24.936
Let's go again!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.818
All right, I'm coming in now.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.945
Wait, there, we're going to go again.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.242
What?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.615
And, you know, something wasn't quite right.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.878
What? I can't hear you. What?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.303
- Megan!
- What?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.282
- Whoa!
- Dude...

15:15.373 --> 15:16.534
That's saying "good day" to us.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.671
You should see your faces.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.044
It's huge, bro.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.501
You should see your face.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.296
- You looked so excited.
- I can't believe how close they got.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.382
That is incredible.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.430
That's awesome!

15:37.520 --> 15:40.103
Oh, man, do they always come this close?

15:40.189 --> 15:42.397
Oh, look at those two getting too close.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.942
Another one coming out.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.365
Oh, my God, look at that!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.329
You're kidding me.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.701
Greg, you're a legend.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.958
I love your hat.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.751
That's me happy.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.627
<i>So after we come back from the boat,</i>

16:08.718 --> 16:10.880
<i>I sort of organized a little party.</i>

16:10.970 --> 16:13.633
You know, a chance that we
could all have a few drinks

16:13.723 --> 16:15.760
and let loose and have a bit of fun.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.276
Do you know what we do
with empty cups around here?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.773
We're on the same page, brother.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.665
Let's hit the pool.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.022
Do you guys love each other,
is that what's happening?

17:07.108 --> 17:08.771
- I love you, man.
- No, but honestly,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.694
I just wanna say thank you
for not only tonight,

17:11.781 --> 17:13.646
everything else you've done
for us the past couple days.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.528
Yeah, man. You're amazing.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.530
Josh wants to thank you, too.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.156
Well, she saw Josh's picture online.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.833
She was very interested.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.161
Megan, you getting this on camera?

17:27.255 --> 17:30.464
Batteries are running out on this.
I'm just going to put it on charge.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.711
I thought it was charged.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.180
Here's a little secret
for the producers of the show.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.430
Another reason why I think
you should choose us

17:41.519 --> 17:47.607
is because I plan to propose to my
future wife, Megan, on the show.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.604
She doesn't know anything about it.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.897
And just to show you how serious I am...

17:56.200 --> 17:58.692
I already got her a ring.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.154
- I plan to...
- Jeff.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.244
Just a minute.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.496
Jeff?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.339
Hey, what you doing?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.542
Your mom's on the phone.
she wants to talk to you.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.796
- Cool.
- So...

18:15.886 --> 18:18.629
I'm just gonna... I need a minute.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.930
Oh.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.870
Hey.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.704
- What are you doing in here?
- What are you doing in here?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.706
Come on out and let's go party.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.960
No, I just, um, I need a minute. Okay?

18:54.050 --> 18:57.214
What are you mad about... Are you jealous?

18:57.303 --> 19:00.262
Yeah, no, just don't flatter yourself. Okay?

19:00.348 --> 19:03.182
You are jealous, aren't you?

19:03.267 --> 19:08.433
Look, hey, hey... she's out there
and I'm in here with you. Right?

19:19.241 --> 19:22.655
This is... This is crazy. He's right outside.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.907
It is crazy, okay?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.330
Seeing you and Jeff together all the time.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.248
I can't touch you, I can't talk with you.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.951
Don't you feel the same way?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.661
We can't... we can't talk
about this right now.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.963
- Okay? He could come in.
- Just wait.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.771
Yep.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.193
Yeah, no, she's just here.
Hey, Mom says, "hi".

19:57.905 --> 20:01.319
No, she's pretty good.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.526
- <i>Jeff...</i>
- Yeah.

20:03.619 --> 20:07.454
<i>I'm really not comfortable with you</i>
<i>doing this shark cage dive thing.</i>

20:08.457 --> 20:10.665
Mom. I told you, it's going to be fine.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.333
I'll call you afterwards, okay?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.456
<i>Have you been taking your medicine?</i>

20:13.546 --> 20:15.503
Yes, I have been taking them.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.377
<i>Okay. Can you just call me straight after?</i>

20:19.885 --> 20:23.504
I was contacted and I heard about
the video recorder being found.

20:24.682 --> 20:28.551
And in my head, I'm thinking...
they've survived.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.850
<i>There's going to be a clue</i>
<i>to it on the video tape.</i>

20:34.108 --> 20:35.565
Thanks for everything brother,

20:35.651 --> 20:38.143
Thanks for stopping by.
I really appreciate it.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.978
- Love you, man.
- Have fun shark diving.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.938
- Oh, we will.
- Don't you get eaten, all right?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.068
I'll try not to get eaten.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.572
Thanks, Greg. Man, you're a legend.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.698
- It was really my pleasure.
- Bye.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.493
Get home safe.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.046
We've arrived. Welcome to Adelaide.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.100
Oh, dude, I can do the Hitchcock with this.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.889
Did you see that?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.645
<i>This is summer!</i>

21:18.986 --> 21:20.727
Wait, wait, wait. Port Lincoln hotel?

21:20.821 --> 21:21.811
- This is us.
- This is it.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.944
Hey, they've got Sharky's Bar. This is it?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.536
Calypso shark bay dive.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.581
That's it. Tomorrow, that's
going to be us right in there.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.388
God, you're such an asshole.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.724
You look sexy when you're wet.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.972
Yeah, right.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.078
Look out!

22:15.042 --> 22:18.035
- Man, what'd you do that for?
- Dude, are you serious?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.118
What?

22:25.928 --> 22:28.170
Hey, Josh. Josh.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.007
Hey, I wanna quickly show you
something while Megan's out.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.432
Yeah, sure, buddy.

22:37.773 --> 22:41.016
<i>Here's a little secret</i>
<i>for the producers of the show.</i>

22:42.319 --> 22:43.605
What is this, man?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.858
<i>You should choose us is because</i>

22:45.948 --> 22:51.194
<i>I plan to propose to my future wife,</i>
<i>Megan, on the show.</i>

22:51.287 --> 22:53.244
<i>She doesn't know anything about it.</i>

22:55.249 --> 22:57.457
This is... this is for real?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.830
Yeah, dude, look at the ring.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.253
<i>I already got her a ring.</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:04.797
<i>I plan to...</i>

23:04.884 --> 23:07.752
Whatever happens,
Megan can't find out about this, okay?

23:07.845 --> 23:10.679
She almost came in here at
the end and ruined the surprise.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.054
Wow, man, I can't believe it.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.137
Oh, that's right, it kept recording.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.481
Hey, Jeff, Jeff.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.186
Thank you, man.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.237
Wow, so you've been thinking
about this a while?

23:28.324 --> 23:31.408
I've been thinking about it probably
the last four months or something,

23:31.493 --> 23:34.907
and after the three year anniversary
I just thought,

23:34.997 --> 23:38.035
you know, that was so perfect and why wait.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.833
And I wanted to tell you
about it first, so...

23:40.920 --> 23:44.084
Well, dude, I'm glad you did.
I'm happy for you, man.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.709
It's great.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.916
But with the video, if you don't mind,

23:48.010 --> 23:50.627
editing it and putting it
into the audition tape.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.088
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.593
Don't worry about that now, dude.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.299
We'll figure it out, but let's...

23:56.393 --> 23:58.476
let's go get a drink or something.
Let's celebrate.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.019
You're getting married, man.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.849
Don't fuckin' high five me. Love you, dude.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.026
All right, let's do it. Your shout?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.318
Yeah, obviously.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.066
Oh, wait, I just forgot the camera.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.113
Oh, yeah, buddy, I got it.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.282
The dawn of a new day.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.203
That's where we're headed.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.037
Yeah, I watched all the footage.

24:30.928 --> 24:35.343
No, I don't know if we... it's the right
thing to show it, or whatever.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.425
Josh... kept filming.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.099
Hey, hey. Shark Cage Dive?

24:42.189 --> 24:43.225
Yup.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.194
Look at that. There it is.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.777
My name's on the list, yo.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.325
- My name's on the list.
- VIP list.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.495
Yeah, spelt my name wrong, but that's okay.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.448
Hey, it's such a good day. And there it is.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.626
I have, like, excited
butterflies in my tummy.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.954
My name's Andrew.
I'll be your skipper for the day.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.220
Go down together, like in the <i>Titanic.</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:26.351
And blow on this whistle hard enough,

25:26.442 --> 25:28.559
apparently the sharks will run away as well.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.985
No turning back now, boys.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.282
The skipper.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.296
<i>The ocean is beautiful.</i>

25:54.386 --> 25:55.627
Come here, check this out.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.882
<i>And meant to be enjoyed by everyone.</i>

25:56.972 --> 26:01.592
<i>The chances of dying from a shark attack</i>
<i>are just one in 900 million</i>

26:01.685 --> 26:02.846
- <i>anywhere in the world.</i>
- Wow, I didn't know that.

26:02.936 --> 26:06.805
<i>However, on rare occasions,</i>
<i>shark attacks have happened.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:10.893
<i>There are a few things you can do</i>
<i>to avoid an unlikely encounter.</i>

26:11.904 --> 26:13.691
<i>Splashing and thrashing.</i>

26:13.781 --> 26:17.525
<i>Sharks are attracted to</i>
<i>erratic movement in the water</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:20.986
<i>as it replicates</i>
<i>the signal of distressed fish.</i>

26:22.706 --> 26:26.074
<i>Don't swim at dawn, dusk or night.</i>

26:26.168 --> 26:29.627
<i>These are the typical hunting times</i>
<i>for most species of shark.</i>

26:29.713 --> 26:31.079
Well, let's not do that then.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.923
<i>Avoid swimming alone.</i>

26:34.009 --> 26:38.253
<i>If you're swimming with other people,</i>
<i>don't separate far from the group.</i>

26:38.347 --> 26:42.261
<i>Sharks are more likely to</i>
<i>attack solitary individuals.</i>

26:42.351 --> 26:46.095
<i>Sharks can sense blood from.25 miles away.</i>

26:46.188 --> 26:51.400
Okay, so this is Josh,
and he is signing away his life.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.523
Okay, so... "entering and exiting the water,

26:54.613 --> 26:56.946
and shark cage with
a possible presence of sharks..."

26:57.032 --> 26:59.115
Hopefully, that's why we're here.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.284
"...which are unpredictable and dangerous

27:01.370 --> 27:04.738
exposing me to attack,
which may result in injury or death."

27:04.832 --> 27:09.167
Right, but there's, like, a huge great cage.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.664
I can see it from here.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.121
I think, you know what, I think
we're going to be all right.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.047
- I think we're going to be okay.
- Yeah.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.503
What the hell is that?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.303
Would a great white fit through that?

27:22.391 --> 27:24.303
Well, if it can fit through that,

27:24.393 --> 27:26.555
I don't think we got nothing to worry about.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.602
- This is the fun part, right?
- Yup.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.733
Did you know that...

27:37.823 --> 27:39.109
Yeah...

27:41.577 --> 27:43.785
I don't see anything yet.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.158
Huge one on the other side, man.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.410
- There is a huge one.
- Right now?

27:50.043 --> 27:52.160
Oh, my gosh.

27:52.254 --> 27:55.918
Oh, my gosh. Oh, wow.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.385
We're going to need a bigger boat.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.138
All right, guys, in the event
you do something really silly

28:07.227 --> 28:08.388
and fall out the cage,

28:08.478 --> 28:11.346
there's a couple of things
you gotta remember.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.982
So, basically, if you happen to do that,
you keep your two feet together,

28:15.068 --> 28:17.936
you pull the stomach wide open, okay?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.022
Feet together and these two tabs.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.903
When you pull that,
the weight belt will release, okay?

28:22.993 --> 28:24.859
And it will come straight off you like that.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.286
Who's going in first?

28:27.372 --> 28:30.160
So long, buddy.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.788
- Good luck.
- Here he comes.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.291
He was just angry...

28:41.303 --> 28:42.885
Here he comes. Look.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.758
Oh, you can see him coming.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.010
Oh, that's so scary.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.644
Hey! That was lucky.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.642
- It bumped the cage, man.
- Yup.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.191
It was just, "knock, knock, anyone in there?"

29:04.701 --> 29:05.942
She did well.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.528
Shark diving ain't for everyone.

29:08.622 --> 29:09.703
I guess not.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.996
I'm actually a bit nervous now.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.578
Take a big deep breath. Hold your nose....

29:16.672 --> 29:18.755
Breathe through that. Take a big deep breath.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.502
- I'm pumped!
- Whoo!

29:22.261 --> 29:24.503
My heart is racing.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.172
Yeah, Megan!

29:32.813 --> 29:34.645
How you going, all right?

29:34.731 --> 29:35.721
You're all right.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.227
She hasn't even seen the shark yet.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.730
Get in the water with her.

29:44.825 --> 29:45.941
- That'll do.
- Thanks.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.323
Yeah, no worries. So, do you
want me to record you going in?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.700
- It should be recording right now, brah.
- Yeah, it is.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.615
Hey, buddy.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.235
Dude, the boat's going down, you guys!

33:14.034 --> 33:16.071
Oh, my God!

33:20.290 --> 33:23.624
Are you okay? Are you okay?

33:25.962 --> 33:27.498
Are you guys okay?

33:27.589 --> 33:29.330
We're coming.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.427
There's a lot of blood.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.259
Keep his head above the water, okay?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.387
Oh, shit.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.232
Just hold it together. Apply some pressure.

33:51.488 --> 33:52.774
I'm gonna check his pulse.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.821
There's no pulse.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.330
You're going to have to
get out of his blood, okay?

34:05.669 --> 34:08.127
Get away from me! Get away!

34:09.380 --> 34:11.464
You have to get out of the blood.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.045
It's not fine. I'm bleeding everywhere.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.128
It's okay, Megan. It's only blood.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.757
Josh, can you see anything?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.605
- Oh, shit.
- Did you see that?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.110
Megan, it's all right.

34:42.205 --> 34:45.494
It's not okay! We were in a cage before!

34:45.583 --> 34:46.620
Help!

34:46.710 --> 34:48.621
It's all right, Megan. Just relax.

34:48.712 --> 34:51.079
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up for a second.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.583
- Help!
- Seriously, shut up for a second.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.710
- Quiet, quiet.
- Somebody help us!

34:54.801 --> 34:57.088
Quiet! I hear something.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.891
Hey! Hey, buddy.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.640
- What happened?
- Over here!

35:06.730 --> 35:10.895
- What happened?
- There was a freak wave.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.647
- Can you swim to us?
- We're over here!

35:25.457 --> 35:26.664
There's something in the water.

35:26.750 --> 35:27.786
What happened?

35:40.597 --> 35:42.384
Oh, shit! Megan!

35:52.984 --> 35:57.319
My name's Josh, and I'm here
with my brother, Jeff, and Megan.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.064
We're in South Australia.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.150
Our boat... Our boat sunk.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.859
I don't know how many people survived.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.160
Stop it.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.496
I don't want to hear this, okay?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.663
Just turn the camera off.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.790
In South Australia... we're waiting for help.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.749
Megan you, okay?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.129
No my leg's hurting.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.961
Can you please check?

36:22.055 --> 36:23.921
Okay, I'll have a look.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.348
Josh, keep an eye out.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.105
It's not too bad.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.820
It looks fine.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.148
I'm bleeding? Is it bleeding?

36:42.242 --> 36:43.358
It's a small cut.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.068
Oh, shit. I'm just going
to look underwater...

36:47.330 --> 36:48.537
Jeff.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.206
- Jeff, look, there's a boat, man.
- What?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.955
- Yeah, way out there.
- Where's the boat?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.537
Oh, shit. Help!

37:01.261 --> 37:02.672
I don't think they can hear us.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.128
Let's swim for it. Come on, let's go.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.473
I can't swim that far. I can't swim that far.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.017
Help!

37:10.103 --> 37:11.560
Hey, Jeff. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.354
Come here, take... I'll do it.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.893
- I'm gonna go first, dude.
- What?

37:18.987 --> 37:22.321
- Jeff's gonna stay here with you.
- Wait, no, no. Josh. Josh, don't go.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.239
- Stay here with us.
- I can make it.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.533
Please, didn't you see
that guy just get eaten before?

37:26.619 --> 37:28.576
Yeah, which is why we need
to get out of the water.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.700
No, if you go by yourself they will get you.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.577
We have to stick together, okay? Come on.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.000
- Josh, go for it.
- What?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.702
You're okay with him just swimming off?

37:36.796 --> 37:38.082
We got to... we got to take this chance.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.334
We have to stick together.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.628
No, come on. Stay with us.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.594
Another one's going to come, okay?

37:49.392 --> 37:51.179
You could've had that, Josh.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.726
The Coast Guard will come.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.099
We can't separate, okay?

38:02.071 --> 38:05.189
<i>A freak wave has capsized a shark dive boat,</i>

38:05.283 --> 38:09.197
<i>throwing everyone overboard</i>
<i>into shark infested waters.</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:11.779
There were a number of
injuries ranging in severity.

38:11.873 --> 38:16.334
And also we can confirm several fatalities.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.961
<i>The rescue effort is continuing</i>

38:23.051 --> 38:25.794
<i>and we have a handful of people</i>
<i>who are not accounted for.</i>

38:29.224 --> 38:31.056
Can you hear that?

38:40.527 --> 38:42.189
This is insane.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.812
What are we doing out here?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.568
You all right?

38:50.954 --> 38:53.412
I can't... I can't swim anymore.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.583
I'm so tired.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.504
You just got to relax. Okay, Megan? Please.

39:01.589 --> 39:05.048
All right? It's the only way
we're going to get through this.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.126
Look, just lie on your back.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.054
It will help you float. Lean back.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.261
Here you go.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.138
I'm going to keep looking
for the helicopters.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.224
What is it?

39:23.236 --> 39:25.068
- What was it, Megan?
- I felt something.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.611
It touched me.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.366
Oh, my God!

39:38.459 --> 39:40.166
Oh, it's a piece of bait.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.474
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

40:00.648 --> 40:02.059
Stay together, guys.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.109
Did you see it? Did you see where it went?

40:05.194 --> 40:06.651
I'm going to go check it out.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.778
It's gone, it's gone.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.990
It's okay, it's okay.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.083
I saw it swim off.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.794
What the hell is that?

40:28.885 --> 40:30.251
What is that?

40:30.345 --> 40:32.086
- Can you see?
- I don't know.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.719
We need to get it. We could float on
that thing, whatever it is.

40:37.477 --> 40:40.345
It's definitely coming this way.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.681
Come on, come on. Swim to it.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.409
Yeah!

41:00.500 --> 41:02.207
High five.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.668
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.838
Oh, my hands.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.210
Frickin' salt.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.306
In an hour or two,
Coast Guard's going to be here,

41:21.396 --> 41:23.809
and this will be just a crazy story.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.605
Just a crazy story.

41:28.695 --> 41:33.151
You're going to be pulling all the chicks,
Josh, telling them about this story.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.448
You know it.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.242
There's no way I'm not using this story.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.536
I'm going to get free beer for life.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.863
- Guys.
- And I'm going to tell

41:40.957 --> 41:42.869
all the girls that you saved us.

41:42.959 --> 41:46.669
Guys, will you...
will you just shut up for a minute?

41:46.754 --> 41:49.212
Just stop joking around, okay?

41:50.299 --> 41:52.382
Megan, we got to stay positive.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.004
Stay positive about what?

41:55.096 --> 41:58.680
Megan, you've got to conserve your energy.

41:58.766 --> 42:02.510
We're going to get through this...
aren't we, Josh?

42:02.603 --> 42:05.016
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get through it.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.768
Fucking hands though are getting eaten up.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.690
Right? Come on, Megan.

42:08.776 --> 42:12.520
You don't have to be all scared all the time.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.570
What are you kidding me?

42:14.657 --> 42:16.649
We're probably being circled by sharks.

42:16.743 --> 42:21.283
Let's talk about what you
wanna do when you get back.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.581
Oh, just, you know, go to McDonald's.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.576
Just eat a burger.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.286
You wanna eat a burger when you get back.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.461
What do you wanna do, Megan?

42:32.175 --> 42:36.294
Megan! What do you wanna
do when you get back?

42:38.473 --> 42:39.634
Let's look at the clouds.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.634
Oh, that's so cold.

42:49.442 --> 42:50.978
- Where is it coming from?
- See it?

42:51.069 --> 42:52.355
It's getting louder.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.277
- I can see it.
- Where?

42:54.363 --> 42:55.695
- Up there.
- Right up there.

42:55.782 --> 42:58.525
- I see it.
- It's like a little white one.

42:58.618 --> 43:01.235
Oh, it's way too high.

43:01.329 --> 43:04.288
It's all right. It's probably just
scouting out the area.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.786
- He'll be back.
- Hey!

43:06.876 --> 43:10.870
- Megan, he's not... he can't see us.
- Megan, Megan.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.205
- Megan, relax.
- Then help me!

43:13.299 --> 43:15.256
- Hello!
- Megan!

43:16.594 --> 43:18.130
Stop laughing at me!

43:18.221 --> 43:21.214
This is not fucking funny, okay?
We need to get rescued, right?

43:21.307 --> 43:22.263
You got to help me.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.433
- We can barely see the... Megan!
- Help!

43:24.519 --> 43:26.761
We can barely see the plane.
They can't see us.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.971
Gosh, just saying relax.

43:29.065 --> 43:31.682
It's okay, Megan. It's all right.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.230
We at least have to try, you know.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.277
Like, do you even want to get rescued?

43:36.364 --> 43:39.778
Yeah, I do. I wanted to
get to the boat, but you said "no".

43:39.867 --> 43:41.324
We can't split up.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.826
Jeff?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.044
What's wrong? Can you say something?

43:54.215 --> 43:55.831
Are you okay?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.637
You okay?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.595
Is it... is it your heart?

44:06.686 --> 44:10.145
- Do you need... Do you need something?
- I'm fine.

44:10.231 --> 44:12.188
- I'm good, I'm good.
- You sure?

44:12.275 --> 44:13.891
Megan, leave him be.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.652
I'm just going to lie on my back.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.856
Okay, we got you. I got you, Jeff. It's okay.

44:36.382 --> 44:37.873
I hope they get here.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.891
Oh, shit.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.597
- What?
- Josh...

44:53.691 --> 44:55.933
See that... heading out there?

44:56.027 --> 44:58.770
Josh, can you zoom in on that?

45:03.242 --> 45:04.699
I'm gonna go for it.

45:04.785 --> 45:05.992
No, Jeff. Jeff, stay here. Come on.

45:06.078 --> 45:08.161
- Megan, it's okay. No.
- Stay with us.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.613
You can't swim.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.414
Josh and I... we're not
going to leave you here.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.958
So you stay here. I'll be right back.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.206
No, that's too far, bro.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.162
I think it's coming here.
I think it's coming towards us.

45:17.256 --> 45:18.497
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.332
It looks like the current's working for us.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.633
- Jeff!
- Jeff, come back.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.711
It looks like the current's working for us.

45:23.804 --> 45:27.138
Let's just wait and see if
it gets a little bit closer.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.387
- Guys.
- It's not going anywhere fast.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.139
It's gonna be coming right to us.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.845
A few more minutes, all right?

45:37.735 --> 45:38.851
All right, guys.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.062
It's close enough for me
to make it, all right?

45:41.155 --> 45:43.898
It drifted in close,
but now it's floating off.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.107
I'm going to get it.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.659
No, you can leave it, like,
a couple more minutes.

45:47.745 --> 45:51.034
No, we can't miss this. We missed the boat.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.285
I got the life vest and that's been great.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.831
I know, but I can't swim any more and we
have to stick together. Come back, come on.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.753
- Megan, look.
- Jeff, come back right now.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.956
Megan, there could be
food and water in there.

46:01.050 --> 46:03.588
We don't know how long we're
going to be out here for, okay?

46:03.678 --> 46:05.044
I'm not staying out here.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.720
I'm just going to get it. I'll be back.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.551
No, Jeff! Jeffery!

46:12.645 --> 46:14.477
Do you see him? I can't see him.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.725
Where'd he go? Jeffery!

46:16.816 --> 46:18.978
Jeffery, come back!

46:19.986 --> 46:22.069
Jeff. Do you see him?

46:23.906 --> 46:26.273
- Jeff!
- Are you okay?

46:26.367 --> 46:27.778
You okay, man?

46:27.868 --> 46:30.155
I thought I was going
to make it the whole way.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.078
Jeff, come back right now.

46:32.164 --> 46:33.496
Maybe just leave it, man.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.165
I'm almost there, guys. Just let me.

46:36.252 --> 46:38.164
- Jeff, come back!
- Jeff!

46:38.254 --> 46:41.588
Oh, shit. I can't see him anymore.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.293
What?

46:46.387 --> 46:48.174
- Jeff!
- Shit!

46:48.264 --> 46:49.721
- Jeff!
- Jeff, get out of there!

46:49.807 --> 46:52.345
- Jeff!
- Come back, man!

46:52.435 --> 46:54.222
Where is it, Josh? Where did it go?

46:54.312 --> 46:55.723
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.139
Oh, sh it!

47:02.820 --> 47:06.734
- Jeff!
- Jeffrey! Jeffrey... Jeffrey!

47:16.375 --> 47:18.788
- It's okay, Megan.
- Oh, my God! Jeffrey!

47:28.804 --> 47:30.636
You son of a bitch!

47:30.723 --> 47:33.181
- Dude, I'm...
- What the hell's wrong with you?

47:33.267 --> 47:34.553
I'm sorry, guys.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.513
Oh, geez.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.487
Is that lightning over there?

47:51.035 --> 47:56.076
We gotta come up with a strategy
to make it through the night.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.000
Oh, shit.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.716
It looks pretty dark.

48:07.802 --> 48:11.341
I think there's a bad storm over there.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.763
At least we've got this life vest.

48:13.849 --> 48:17.138
It's not going to do much if nobody comes.

48:17.228 --> 48:20.767
I know, I know. It's all right.
We can do it, Megan.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.392
I love you.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.411
Just turn the camera off, okay?

48:37.498 --> 48:40.662
Please just turn it... turn it off.

48:40.751 --> 48:44.370
Just wait. We said we were
going to document everything.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.830
- It's for the audition tape.
- What do you mean?

48:46.924 --> 48:51.089
You want to film us dying out here
so someone can find it?

48:51.178 --> 48:53.044
- No.
- Please just turn it off.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.471
- Yeah, I guess, Josh.
- Please.

48:54.557 --> 48:56.014
Does that thing...

48:56.100 --> 48:59.264
It's got night vision.
We can use it, so maybe just save it.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.434
Yeah.

49:05.651 --> 49:07.517
You see anything, Josh?

49:07.611 --> 49:09.443
I see, like, a flashing light.

49:09.530 --> 49:11.692
A helicopter or something.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.525
Some kind of rescue.

49:14.618 --> 49:16.530
To me it looks like they're flying away.

49:18.080 --> 49:20.697
They don't... I think
they stop the rescues at night.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.033
What? Why would they do that?

49:24.962 --> 49:25.952
It's...

49:26.046 --> 49:29.084
Guys, we just got to stay here where we are.

49:29.175 --> 49:33.044
Take care of each other. Get through it.

49:34.346 --> 49:35.553
Oh, it's so cold.

49:41.395 --> 49:44.012
What are you doing
with the... with the camera, Josh?

49:44.106 --> 49:47.315
I thought I heard something.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.602
Hey, what is that?

49:50.696 --> 49:51.857
What?

49:53.032 --> 49:55.069
Stupid night vision isn't working.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.900
Oh, my God. It is...
is that a shark? Oh, my God.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.360
- Shh...
- No, no, no. Oh, my God!

49:58.454 --> 49:59.820
- Jeffrey.
- It's okay, it's nothing.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.076
- Josh, what can you see, man?
- Straight ahead, man.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.282
There's something floating right...

50:03.375 --> 50:04.741
It just floated right past us.

50:04.835 --> 50:05.996
Wait, wait, wait. Jeff, Jeff, come back.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.748
- Grab it!
- Jeff, Jeff don't go too far. Jeff!

50:08.756 --> 50:09.872
Get it, man.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.755
- What is that?
- Bring it over here.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.086
Jeff, please be careful.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.929
Hey, man, I can't see you.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.595
- Did you get it?
- Jeff?

50:22.603 --> 50:23.559
Oh, sh it!

50:23.646 --> 50:25.763
- Jeff?
- Got it.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.060
I'm coming back.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.101
He's coming.

50:33.113 --> 50:36.026
- You shitting me?
- Oh, my God!

50:36.116 --> 50:37.357
- Really?
- Look at this thing.

50:37.451 --> 50:39.989
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

50:40.079 --> 50:41.365
Oh, my God.

50:41.455 --> 50:43.913
- What does it say?
- Oh, my God.

50:43.999 --> 50:46.207
I think it's a life raft.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.577
Four persons.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.795
Oh, shit, you're right, man.

50:53.342 --> 50:59.589
"To operate, throw overboard and pull line.

50:59.682 --> 51:01.548
Yes!

51:01.642 --> 51:03.053
We're saved.

51:03.143 --> 51:06.011
Pull the line. Just pull the fucking line.

51:07.606 --> 51:08.562
Ready?

51:08.649 --> 51:10.060
- One...
- You need me to help?

51:10.150 --> 51:12.187
It keeps pulling through.
I'm gonna pull it again.

51:12.278 --> 51:13.268
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:13.362 --> 51:15.729
One, two, three!

51:26.375 --> 51:27.911
Are you getting this, Josh?

51:29.128 --> 51:31.495
It's like a fucking bouncy castle.

51:33.799 --> 51:36.963
- Look!
- Whoa!

51:37.052 --> 51:39.886
- Oh, my God. We can climb in there.
- We have a castle.

51:41.307 --> 51:44.095
All right. What do you think?

51:44.184 --> 51:46.892
- Get up in there, man.
- Think it's got a barbecue in there?

51:46.979 --> 51:51.189
- Get in! Oh, my God.
- Maybe... a case of beer?

51:53.944 --> 51:55.776
That thing's fuckin...

51:58.198 --> 52:00.815
Is that normal? It's like hissing now.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.697
It's okay, I think
it's a gas cylinder filling up.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.699
Oh, my God. It's fucking huge.

52:07.374 --> 52:08.740
I'm going to get in it.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.248
Don't let me kick you.

52:20.888 --> 52:22.754
All right, Megan.

52:22.848 --> 52:24.259
Get her up in there, dude.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.973
This thing...

52:29.063 --> 52:30.395
Come on.

52:30.481 --> 52:33.098
I shotgun the king size bed.

52:33.192 --> 52:35.980
- Josh, you get the bunk bed.
- Here, Jeff.

52:36.070 --> 52:39.154
- Jerk.
- Take this life... Take the life vest.

52:39.239 --> 52:40.275
Take the life...

52:43.494 --> 52:46.407
- Megan, you wanna start the fire?
- Take the camera.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.363
- Come on, look at this!
- Jeff.

52:48.457 --> 52:50.915
Jeff, get me the fuck out of here.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.082
Jeff.

52:53.379 --> 52:54.961
Jeff! Take the camera.

52:55.047 --> 52:57.130
- Take the camera.
- Sorry, bro.

52:57.216 --> 53:00.175
Oh, my God.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.751
There it is.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.763
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

53:07.893 --> 53:12.809
So, basically, we got enough
food to last us quite some time.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.356
So we've been on the open water
for a few hours now,

53:15.442 --> 53:18.025
I'm not sure for how long right now.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.980
But we came across a life raft.

53:21.073 --> 53:23.030
We're doing okay now.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.824
We got some supplies here.

53:24.910 --> 53:28.028
And even some flares. How good is that?

53:28.122 --> 53:30.079
Yeah, that's awesome.
Just be careful with those.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.083
But we got... Jeff, what we got, man?

53:34.169 --> 53:37.207
- Give me the lowdown, here.
- We got smoke signal.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.913
We got some smoke signals.

53:39.007 --> 53:42.967
- Water. We got...
- Emergency drinking water.

53:43.053 --> 53:46.546
We got protein, Josh. You can keep in shape.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.097
If you'd like to.

53:49.268 --> 53:51.009
First aid kit.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.348
- First aid.
- All right.

53:55.607 --> 53:58.350
Oh, don't film that. That's just gross.

54:13.667 --> 54:14.657
Please turn the cam...

54:16.295 --> 54:17.536
Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it.

54:17.629 --> 54:19.165
I wanna make sure I get this.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.293
Okay, Megan's going to
set off our first flare.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.749
Make sure it's pointing up.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.084
It's pointing up.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.464
Okay, on three. You ready?

54:25.554 --> 54:26.795
Yeah.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.848
One, two...

54:37.191 --> 54:40.935
Hey, there she is.
Bright light pointing us home.

54:41.028 --> 54:42.018
That's cool.

54:44.031 --> 54:47.691
If this isn't survival skills to get us
on the show, I don't know what is.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.620
Look at it. Someone's going to see that.

54:52.706 --> 54:53.867
For sure!

54:53.957 --> 54:55.869
Yeah, at this time tomorrow morning

54:55.959 --> 54:58.827
we're all going to be
enjoying Vegemite sandwiches.

54:59.838 --> 55:00.828
I'll take it.

55:07.888 --> 55:09.345
Jeff, did you fart?

55:10.349 --> 55:12.557
Oh... who did that?

55:13.977 --> 55:16.594
Who's farting? Jeff, was that you?

55:16.688 --> 55:18.554
- It was me.
- Oh, that stinks!

55:18.649 --> 55:20.231
What, do you stink!

55:22.277 --> 55:23.267
Can you hear that?

55:24.279 --> 55:26.020
Josh, take a look, man.

55:27.241 --> 55:29.278
Oh, my God, do you see something?

55:29.368 --> 55:30.984
Oh, my God.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.950
I can't even see him anymore.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.532
Oh, God, we missed it.

55:39.127 --> 55:43.292
So we've been waiting
a few hours now for help

55:43.382 --> 55:46.341
and we haven't seen anything, but...

55:46.426 --> 55:49.169
No one's going to come.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.629
Yes, they are, Megan.

55:52.349 --> 55:56.843
We're hoping that tomorrow morning,
if we can just hunker down here...

55:56.937 --> 55:59.850
We'll just ration our water
and food for a couple days.

55:59.940 --> 56:03.149
We saw a helicopter earlier today.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.601
I'm sure they'll be back.

56:04.695 --> 56:08.154
Hopefully, we'll be seeing somebody tomorrow.

56:19.293 --> 56:23.003
I just wanna leave something behind.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.295
Something...

56:26.133 --> 56:30.343
because we might not get out of this, and...

56:42.816 --> 56:44.148
Mom...

56:45.485 --> 56:47.898
and Dad, and...

56:49.489 --> 56:52.323
Julian, I love you guys so much.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.490
My God.

56:58.874 --> 57:02.083
And I know I made a lot of mistakes, and...

57:04.796 --> 57:07.334
I'm hurting both of them...

57:11.345 --> 57:13.837
but I know what I need to do now.

57:18.685 --> 57:22.304
If we get out of this,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix it.

57:39.790 --> 57:40.780
Wake up, wake up.

57:40.874 --> 57:42.740
- What was that, seriously?
- Was that you?

57:42.834 --> 57:44.496
There's something pushing against the side.

57:44.586 --> 57:45.952
Did you bump against it?

57:46.046 --> 57:47.912
No, it wasn't me, there's...
It's still happening.

57:48.006 --> 57:50.874
- There's something still there.
- Hold up.

57:50.968 --> 57:52.379
What's that?

57:58.475 --> 58:00.182
Are you sure you felt something?

58:01.311 --> 58:04.645
Oh, my God. It's a shark.

58:04.731 --> 58:08.520
Oh, my God. Do you see it?
Did you see where it went?

58:08.610 --> 58:10.317
- Over here.
- Where?

58:10.404 --> 58:12.987
Guys, don't all come to one side. Be careful.

58:13.073 --> 58:14.063
- No, Josh!
- Whoa!

58:15.575 --> 58:17.862
Josh! Josh! Josh, dude!

58:17.953 --> 58:20.286
- Are you okay?
- Give me your hand, man.

58:20.372 --> 58:23.331
- Give me your hand!
- Get me up!

58:23.417 --> 58:24.908
- Josh!
- Josh!

58:25.002 --> 58:26.288
Climb up, man.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.665
- Climb up!
- Come on, quickly.

58:28.755 --> 58:30.712
Oh, my God, there's something...

58:30.799 --> 58:34.042
Oh, shit. Give me the flashlight.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.714
Oh. It's a person.

58:39.808 --> 58:43.927
Hey! Hey! Here, here, here. Hold the light.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.684
I'm going back in.

58:46.773 --> 58:49.641
Hey, Josh, Josh. Be careful, man.

58:54.489 --> 58:55.821
Josh, you okay?

59:02.080 --> 59:04.697
That's it, Josh, you got it.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.407
- Is she okay?
- Megan, take this.

59:06.501 --> 59:09.289
Okay, get... get her out.
Get us out of the water.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.791
- That's it, buddy.
- Grab her, grab her, grab her.

59:17.679 --> 59:20.672
- She's so cold, man.
- Hey.

59:20.766 --> 59:22.382
Hey, sweetie, can you hear me?

59:22.476 --> 59:24.092
What's your name? Do you know where you are?

59:24.186 --> 59:25.927
Hey.

59:26.938 --> 59:29.100
Hey! Does she have a pulse, bro?

59:29.191 --> 59:31.399
Tell me she has a pulse, please.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.568
She's so cold.

59:33.653 --> 59:35.736
- Jeff, we got to do something.
- Yeah, yeah, guys, she's got a pulse.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.279
She's got a pulse, but it's very weak.

59:37.365 --> 59:40.949
Just got to warm her up first, okay?
It's just gonna....

59:41.036 --> 59:43.779
It's not working, she's not waking up.
We got to do something else.

59:43.872 --> 59:45.488
Just keep rubbing her legs for me.

59:47.667 --> 59:48.657
Just keep...

59:50.754 --> 59:52.336
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing with that?

59:52.422 --> 59:54.129
We got to do something, Josh.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.799
She's not waking up,
and I don't know what else to do.

59:56.885 --> 59:59.298
We're going to do what we can,
but we're not going to use that flare.

59:59.387 --> 01:00:00.923
Someone's going to see it.
Someone's going to save us.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.301
No one's going to see it.
Think about the first flare.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.053
- Someone will see it this time.
- Dude, dude, Jeff...

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.930
Josh, stop her.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.932
- Megan, listen to us.
- I don't care about her.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.809
I care about you and I care about Jeff,
and you're going to

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:13.733
- frickin' screw us all by doing this.
- It's going to save all four of us.

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.276
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is!

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.898
- You're not even thinking straight!
- I am thinking straight!

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.775
- We're doing this!
- Megan!

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.777
Watch where you're pointing...

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.017
- Get away!
- She's still in there!

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:50.515
- It's too late for her.
- Oh, my God!

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.110
Oh, my God! Josh, she's still in there!

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.982
Get back!

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.325
No, no, no, no!

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.823
What did we do?

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.405
No! Dammit!

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:16.166
Jeff, come back. Baby, please.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.249
- He's gone!
- I told you!

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.881
Megan. I told you to leave the flare alone.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.837
- Look what you've done.
- Leave it, Josh.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.923
I just wanted to help her.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.354
Megan. Megan.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.141
Megan!

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.735
Stop, you're freaking out.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.905
Turn the camera off.
I don't want this recorded.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:49.446
- Dude, chill.
- Dude, she's freaking out, man.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:52.953
What are you doing? Are you kidding me? Josh!

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.535
Relax, okay? It's the best tool we have.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.541
I'm not going to turn it off.

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.543
You're freaking out. You're not thinking.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:03.673
Why are we even out here? This is so stupid.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:08.928
We are stuck in the middle of
the ocean because of you, Josh.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.929
Are you frickin' kidding me?

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:13.557
You're the one who set off
the flare in the life raft.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.685
Because you're the one who wanted
to do this stupid audition tape.

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:18.391
Now we're in the middle of the ocean.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.896
And we're gonna die out here.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:23.070
And we all decided that we were
going to do this together, okay?

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.442
- Josh, Josh, Josh, relax.
- Oh, stop lying.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.489
- Dude, she's freaking out, man.
- It was always your idea.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.193
This was always your idea.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:31.199
- Stop splashing.
- Don't touch me right now.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.872
- Okay, just get off.
- You're going to fucking attract sharks.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.747
- You're the frickin' liar, okay?
- What?

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:37.917
What do you mean with that?

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.586
Lying to me, lying to yourself.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.414
- You're lying to Jeff.
- What?

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.171
Just... just... just calm down,

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.674
just shut up for two seconds, God.

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:52.091
Wait. Wait what do you mean...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.472
- Nothing, man.
- She's fucking...

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:57.976
- You said she's lying to me.
- Nothing. Megan, just shut up.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.479
- About what?
- Nothing, man, just come back.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.936
- He's just talking...
- No, Josh said...

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.271
- No, no...
- Shut...

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.778
Josh said, what? You're fucking lying to me.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:10.109
Everybody just settle down, okay?
Come back over here.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.787
Look, we just need to concentrate
on surviving through the night, okay?

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.990
Josh, you got something to tell me or what?

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.581
- No, man, we got nothing to tell you.
- No, well you just said

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:22.630
that Megan's lying to me.
What is she lying to me about?

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.298
- Nothing, okay?
- Nothing...

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:27.047
What, are you guys fucking fooling around

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.719
behind my back or something?

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.218
Jeff, just please calm down, okay?
Now is not the time...

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.640
- Oh...
- Jeff.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.934
Oh, now it all fucking makes sense.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.512
- You fucking serious?
- Don't be like that, man.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.222
- Jeff, can you just come back here?
- Jeff, come over here, okay?

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.603
- We'll talk about this.
- Please, just calm down.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.355
You're supposed to be my fucking brother.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.653
Jeff, don't be like that, man. Just come on.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.231
Yeah, and you don't fucking touch me.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.655
Fuck you guys. You're on your own.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.953
- What?
- Jeff, what are you doing, man?

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.701
You're on your own. You can fuck off.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.281
- What are you talking about?
- Don't be an idiot, man.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.037
- Come on.
- I never want to see your face again.

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.243
- No, please.
- Jeff.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.953
You deserve each other.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:03.754
Jeff, come on. Get back here, man.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.456
You can both go to fucking hell!

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.257
Get back, Jeff, come on.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.461
Oh, my God!

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:11.716
- Megan!
- Do you see anything?

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:13.672
Megan, I don't see nothing. Megan.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.510
There's something...

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.246
- Something touched my leg.
- Megan!

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.244
- Are you okay?
- Help me, please.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.627
Help me, Jeff, please.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.377
It's okay, Megan, just relax.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.503
Megan, it's okay.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.175
- Help me!
- No, it's going to be okay.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.423
- Just swim to me all right?
- I can't.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:55.257
Just focus on me, okay?

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.511
I don't want to die.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.305
Jeff...

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:01.804
Megan!

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.238
Megan!

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:22.120
- Megan!
- I can't see her, Jeff. I can't see her.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.792
Keep searching. Keep looking, Josh.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.502
Josh, can you see her?

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.556
I can't find her, Jeff. I can't find her.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.060
You fucking...

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.150
Why'd you have to swim off, man?

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.694
Why'd you have to swim off?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.737
Megan!

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:05.539
Josh, you're a scumbag. You know that, right?

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.371
How's your conscience after
what happened tonight?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.040
Josh.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.126
What, you're not going to say anything?

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:23.352
Josh. Hey, Josh.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.896
Hey, look at the camera, man.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.939
I'm making the video now. Look.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.392
Hey.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.770
Get off the life vest.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.902
I found it. Go find your
own fucking life vest.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.733
Get off.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.320
Josh. Huh, what are doing still
hanging around here, buddy?

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.871
Nobody wants you.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.495
Yeah? You know what?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:50.000
If we ever get back,
I'm going to put this video online.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.457
Everybody's going to see you
for the scumbag that you are.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.508
How do you feel about that, Josh?

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.552
Huh, buddy?

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.006
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.216
You're not my brother anymore.
I hope you know that.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.514
I'm disgraced with you.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:10.061
And everyone who's gonna see this
is going to feel the same way.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.561
Knock it off. Knock it off.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.645
Quit it.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:16.738
Stop it.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:19.362
- You know that.
- Turn off the camera.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.533
You're pathetic.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:24.113
- How can you say that, man?
- I told you...

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.876
- How do you think I fucking feel?
- And I was going to marry Megan.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.579
- What do you think we were doing?
- And what'd you go ahead and do, huh?

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:34.211
What do you think...

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.425
I loved her, too.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.757
- What?
- I loved her, too.

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:42.385
- Don't say that.
- I wanted to tell you.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.341
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You wanted to tell me?

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.677
- I wanted to tell you right.
- You didn't have to tell me shit.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.888
- You just...
- I wanted to.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.270
Knock it off!

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.488
Jeff, stop it.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.613
Jeff! Jeff, are you okay?

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.744
Is it your heart?

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:16.006
I told you to settle down, man.
I told you to settle down.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.966
It's going to be okay. I'm so sorry...

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.511
Jeff.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.011
Hey, hey, stay with me, man.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.643
Just hang in there, buddy.
Help's going to come.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.850
They're going to bring your medicine
and we're going to get out of here.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.354
Both of us, man.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.357
Just hang in there, just hang in there.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.694
Hang in there, man. Hang in there.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:48.613
Somebody help me!

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.331
Help me!

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:11.804
I don't want to...

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.389
I've gotta let go.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.189
Jeff.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.241
I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.076
I'm sorry.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.093
I don't have much battery left.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.890
And I don't think I'm going to make it alive.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.469
So, just... if anyone finds this

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:57.228
please tell my mom and dad that I love them.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:01.695
I love you and I miss you so much.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.238
I miss you so much.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.784
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:15.784
Jeff, if I could, I'd take it all back, man.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:20.081
I never would have over stepped
the line with you and Megan.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.958
You mean the world to me.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.293
You mean...

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:29.553
But I know that can't happen.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.430
I watched you die.

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.313
Now, it's my turn.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.535
Hey! Hey!

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.872
Hey!

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.474
Hey! Hey!

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:57.387
You know, they put everything on that.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:03.063
It's quite brutal how it all went down.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.939
And we saw them...

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.569
try to hold on to hope.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.578
Will you take a photo of us?

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.952
- Hi, guys.
- How are we doing?

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:20.125
- Good, yeah.
- I know I look good.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.828
One, two, three.
