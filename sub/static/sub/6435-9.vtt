WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:03.602
Hey, man, what's up, man?

00:03.604 --> 00:04.937
How you want $30, man,
apiece for the fight, man?

00:04.939 --> 00:05.971
That ain't fair.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.107
We might as well order
the fight ourselves.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.275
This fool out here tripping,
man, talking about...
Let me see.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.778
Nigga, as much as we protected
your ass when we was kids,

00:12.780 --> 00:14.680
and you pulling
this ho shit?

00:14.682 --> 00:15.781
Hello?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.950
That nigga's selfish, man.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.852
Why we can't watch
the fight at your house?

00:19.854 --> 00:21.320
You know I can't stand it
when you ask me the same thing

00:21.322 --> 00:23.022
over and over again.
Stop asking me.

00:23.024 --> 00:26.125
Here, I'm giving a
Filipino-themed party.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.159
Shit, Ms. Tudi is...

00:27.161 --> 00:28.460
broadening her horizon.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.695
See what I'm saying?

00:29.697 --> 00:31.663
Any of you
niggas Filipino?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.665
Huh?
JASON: Come on,
Ms. Tudi, please.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.968
Everybody charging at
least $25, $30 to get in.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.970
Jesus tell him, this
is called tough love.

00:37.972 --> 00:39.972
Y'all gonna really
appreciate this

00:39.974 --> 00:42.508
when you can afford to pay
for your own fight party.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.543
Go to Fish's house.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.311
Ms. Tudi, you know
we ain't got no money.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.646
That ain't my problem.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.814
Devon, do me a favor, baby,

00:48.816 --> 00:50.215
and put these trays
in the truck, okay?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.650
My name is Tray.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.218
Right, nigga, put the trays
in the truck.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.319
My<i> name</i> is Tray.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.988
(speaks foreign language)

00:55.990 --> 00:59.558
That means Filipino
for "kiss my ass."

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
Hey, man, we got to find
a way to watch this fight, man.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.195
Man, I ain't missing
the damn fight, man.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.696
Everybody else
gonna see it.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.832
What you say we do what
we always do around this time?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.167
Let's pray, y'all.
Yeah.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.235
Come on, come on, bring it
on in, bring it on in.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.841
Dear Lord,
that Jackson-Santos fight

01:15.843 --> 01:17.843
is the fight
of the century, Lord.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.845
Please lead us to a way
where we can see this fight

01:19.847 --> 01:22.514
and have a great event
for the evening, Father God.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.517
Thank you, Lord,
and in my name we pray, amen.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.819
ALL:
Amen.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.051
Now that's tight.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.753
Got that old Sammy Davis Jr.
feel to it.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.088
Here, this one's for you.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.957
Oh, no, no, no,
I know what I'm-a wear.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.226
And it's gonna be sharp...
(whoops)

02:07.228 --> 02:09.228
Lloyd, I'm not letting you
dress yourself, man.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.963
This party has a Vegas theme.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.265
And that's how we gonna
be rolling-- Vegas theme.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.400
I got to go check
the guest list.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.735
That reminds me.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.936
How many friends
do I get to invite?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.771
Uh, absolutely none.
None?!

02:19.773 --> 02:21.907
Well, that's not fair.
Why can't my friends come?

02:21.909 --> 02:23.775
'Cause your friends are
vagrants, Lloyd. They stink.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.078
You lucky I'm letting
your funky ass up in here, man.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.747
And besides, I pay
the cable bill, nigga.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.249
Well, it's still not fair.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.416
How many people you invite?

02:31.418 --> 02:33.252
Exactly 12.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.087
Plus you and me, that's 14.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.589
And from the space,
the booze, the food,

02:37.591 --> 02:39.758
and us all sharing
the same bathroom,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.093
14's the perfect number.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.961
I can't believe
this is happening, man.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.164
The big fight right
in my living room.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.634
Jackson-Santos!

02:48.636 --> 02:50.435
(laughs)
(groans)

02:50.437 --> 02:51.770
Ew!

02:51.772 --> 02:53.272
TRAYVON: All right,
good news and bad news,

02:53.274 --> 02:55.474
I found a place in Century City,

02:55.476 --> 02:57.943
but it's a hundred bucks
a person, so...
Ugh, that's unbelievable, man.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.344
Hey, Tray, don't
your pops still do

02:59.346 --> 03:00.779
the flimflam
with the janky cable?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.781
Oh, yeah, why we didn't
think about that earlier?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.650
Come on, Tray,
you know your pops is

03:04.652 --> 03:07.286
the Compton cable hookup
king, man.
TRAYVON: Look, I'd love to,

03:07.288 --> 03:08.954
but you guys remember the whole
situation between him and Vic

03:08.956 --> 03:10.289
that went down a couple
years ago, right?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.456
Yeah, I-I remember.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.824
It was, uh, the
rebate thing.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.626
FISH: Oh, hell yeah.
What's the rebate thing?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.461
Man, Vic punk ass had
this system worked out

03:16.463 --> 03:17.796
to where he ain't
pay shit for cable,

03:17.798 --> 03:19.131
'cause when they move into the
complex,

03:19.133 --> 03:20.632
he made 'em sign
up through his account.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.701
That way, he got all
the rebate kickbacks.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.136
So?
TRAYVON: So my father
hooks someone up

03:24.138 --> 03:26.205
in the complex
with some cable, right?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.873
They cancel their account,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.175
causing Vic to have to pay
ten percent more each month.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.177
He went ballistic, and
he's still mad about it.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.313
Man, (bleep) Vic and his
big-ass piano teeth, man.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.981
It's the biggest fight
of our lifetime,

03:35.983 --> 03:37.149
and I ain't missing
this shit for nobody.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.984
Besides, man,
that was two years ago.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.686
Yeah, really, Tray,
that's some bullshit, man.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.188
I don't see no reason why
you shouldn't at least try.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.724
Try, man.
Yeah, but I don't
want any trouble.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.526
Hey, man, you need
to call your dad.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.529
I'd try to call my dad,
but he keep changing his number.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.998
I'm just glad you down to steal
some cable with your boys.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I thought you went straight
Goody Two-Shoes on us.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.035
Nah, ain't nobody stealing,
this is not stealing, dawg.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.904
Cable should be free
for everybody, man.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.073
Your boy ain't got no love
for these big cable monopolies.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.541
Hey, Tray, I'm-a need you
to complete this mission.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.209
We got to see
this fight, dawg.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.044
You holla at your pops,
and I'm-a holla at mine.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.846
FISH:
Hey, for real,
Tray, come on,

04:07.848 --> 04:10.015
Trayvon, man, we need to come
through in the clutch, baby.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.683
(all encouraging Trayvon)

04:11.685 --> 04:12.851
BOONIE:
That's right, man.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.520
MAN:
Lloyd Hamilton?

04:15.522 --> 04:17.422
What?!
I'm eating dinner.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.260
Who is it?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.594
What you have here, brah?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.663
Sign right here.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.274
Oh, wow.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.210
Ah.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.345
(chuckles)

04:42.615 --> 04:44.816
(whoops gently)

04:46.219 --> 04:47.786
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.904
Man, Big Tray, we really
appreciate this, dawg.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.072
That's a good look, man.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.907
We ain't got no
bread right now,

05:08.909 --> 05:10.909
but you're welcome
to whatever we got.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.577
Jee, you know your money
ain't no good here.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.747
I just appreciate you letting
Tray hang with you, man.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.416
Say, man, you
know what it is.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.917
We love Tray, man.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.452
Okay, guys, we get it,
love is love, I understand.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.653
But we really need to clear out

05:21.655 --> 05:22.954
before Vic and Lloyd
get back, okay?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.756
You're right, so check it.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.959
Y'all have the fight right
now, plus the deluxe package,

05:27.961 --> 05:30.495
HBO, man, all the
channels, man.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.931
I even hooked you up with
the porno channel, man.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.434
Aah, boom, I'm good! What!

05:35.436 --> 05:38.337
Ooh! That's what I'm
talking about, Big Tray.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.771
Good looking out, man.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.307
I'm-a round up everybody
else in the building,

05:42.309 --> 05:43.842
and we're gonna bring you
some more business.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.444
Oh, I'm down with
that business.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.778
One love.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.113
What? No, not a good idea, guys.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.681
What about Vic?
Man, (bleep) Vic.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.450
No, he right, I
should... right.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.019
Hand me my bag, Tray.
Okay, cool, look,
I'll leave first.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.121
Just keep a lookout.
Okay.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.789
Hey, Jee, you
got any smoke?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.658
Oh, I got you, loved one.
Now that's what I'm saying.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.326
Some of that good fire.
Yeah, man.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.729
Hey, how Rita doing?
You talk to her?
Yeah, she doing...

06:07.633 --> 06:08.967
(laughing victoriously)

06:08.969 --> 06:11.503
There we go,
there we go.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.638
Hell yeah.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.640
FISH:
A'ight, so look,

06:15.642 --> 06:17.309
now that we got
the cable hookup,

06:17.311 --> 06:19.044
how about we all
put together some money

06:19.046 --> 06:21.713
so we can send Trayvon
to the store to get some snacks.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.649
Okay, first of all, I thought I
worked for the big guy, not you.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.984
Settle down.
Hey, yo, Jesus.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.652
Will you politely inform
your servant

06:27.654 --> 06:30.322
that if I say he's going
to the store, that he's going?

06:30.324 --> 06:32.491
Tray, man, go and hook
it up for your boy, man.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.326
You can do it,
you got the bike.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.994
Hey, yo, check it out,
I got an idea.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.996
Now that we got cable,
how come we can't be

06:37.998 --> 06:40.665
one of them people overcharging
niggas for the fight?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.667
(chuckles)
A fight party?

06:42.669 --> 06:44.836
BOONIE:
Our own fight party.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.739
A fair-price fight party
sound good.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.341
Yeah, but the only
thing is, man,

06:49.343 --> 06:51.343
y'all know Vic gonna be trying
to shut it down ASAP.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.178
Maybe if we do it
in here, he will.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.680
But not if we
do it out here.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.849
Vic can't say nothing
if we have it out there.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.186
Oh, he sure
can't say shit.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.188
That's outside
complex property.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.590
Look, guys, uh, I'm not
sure about this, there's--

07:05.592 --> 07:08.193
obviously there's, like, a
million ways it could go wrong,

07:08.195 --> 07:09.694
so we should think
about it, you know?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.363
Tray, Tray, Tray.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.232
Come on, man, you got to put
your trust in the Lord

07:14.234 --> 07:16.067
and put your faith
in me, man. Cool?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.603
It-It's not cool how you
bring up the Jesus card,

07:18.605 --> 07:19.938
like, all the time.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.374
Well, I'm Jesus,
"like, all the time."

07:22.376 --> 07:24.609
Now, come on, man,
we got to figure out

07:24.611 --> 07:26.711
how much we're gonna charge,
and we got to get the word out.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.380
Then we got to get
the food situated,

07:28.382 --> 07:30.248
and I'm-a check up
on the AV hookup.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.384
A'ight, come on, Boonie,
we'll do everything else.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.952
What else is there?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.554
Son of a bitch.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.488
(pounding on door)

07:43.729 --> 07:45.597
What you want, Mr. Teeth?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.132
I heard Big Tray
was up in there.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.401
That nigga's banned
off the visitor's list.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.069
And he also didn't
sign in with Lloyd.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.738
FISH: Nah, man, I don't know
nothing about that, Vic.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.407
Oh, you don't know
nothing about it, huh?
Nope.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.242
I'm-a tell you right
now, if he's in there

07:57.244 --> 07:59.911
hooking up some janky cable,
that's against complex rules.

07:59.913 --> 08:03.081
You still got cable?
No, man, I cut my cable off
'cause I'm flat broke, man.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.249
Look.
(TV blares)

08:04.251 --> 08:06.918
Oh, yeah, so, so
wh-what's that, huh?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.420
That sound like cable to me.
Nah, man,

08:08.422 --> 08:10.789
it's just the homies clowning
around, acting crazy.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.990
The homies in there
clowning, huh?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.660
VIC:
Say, nigga, hey! Hey!

08:15.662 --> 08:16.828
Hey, I'm talking to you!

08:16.830 --> 08:18.096
Y'all come check it out.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.799
Nigga, you ain't the police.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.133
Hey, look, I told you
more than once.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.469
When you steal cable
from this complex,

08:24.471 --> 08:26.471
you're messing with my monthly
referral rebate,

08:26.473 --> 08:28.507
which means you're stealing
directly from me.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.142
You know how much I pay
for my monthly cable bill?!
You tell him, Vic.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.278
Ten percent!
Ten percent, tell him, Vic!

08:33.280 --> 08:36.114
Vic, Vic, look, man, I ain't
got no beef with you, homie.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.450
All right? You know, and
you're a little bit too old

08:38.452 --> 08:40.819
to be playing that
(bleep) bully role.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.355
(chuckles)

08:43.357 --> 08:45.023
Too old, huh?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.958
Boy, you been watching
<i>Friday Night Fights,</i> huh?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.460
Something got you
feeling strong?

08:48.462 --> 08:51.630
Hey, Tray, I think Vic about
to whup your daddy ass.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.964
I got my money on Big Tray.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.367
Whup his ass, Big Tray!
Walk away, Dad!

08:55.369 --> 08:57.636
Right in this courtyard, right
now, nigga.
Let's go, nigga,
flex, nigga, flex, nigga.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.204
BIG TRAY: Nigga, I...
VIC: Expand, nigga, what's up?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.805
I don't want to
(bleep) with you, Vic,

09:00.807 --> 09:02.340
but I will.
I will, nigga.
Come into my zone, nigga.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.109
What's up, huh?
Step, then, step on me.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.346
Out the way, man. You're
too old for this, Vic!

09:08.348 --> 09:09.714
I ain't gonna be out
here looking stupid

09:09.716 --> 09:11.316
'cause you're mad
about a rebate.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.318
Nigga, come on, grow up!

09:13.320 --> 09:14.819
You should have thought
about all that shit

09:14.821 --> 09:16.321
before you disrespected
my property.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.889
Come on, nigga, fight me
like a man, nigga.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.991
Jesus, I told you
we got to be more careful.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.159
I got bad knees.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.193
Hey, Vic, come on, man, chill,

09:22.195 --> 09:24.162
brother, look, we sorry, man.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.897
I'll tell you what, man,
I'll tell you what.
Swing, nigga.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.832
Defend yourself, nigga.
You know what? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

09:27.834 --> 09:30.402
I'm-a record this for
my own legal protection.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.903
You step on me, step on
me, man, I'm-a tell you,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.371
I'm-a sue your ass.
Sit your ass, nigga.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.773
Nigga, that's not
even a real gun.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.677
(laughs)

09:38.679 --> 09:40.178
That's good
for your ass!

09:40.180 --> 09:41.680
Vic, Vic, you all right?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.415
Stay the (bleep) away from me;
if we're having a fight,

09:43.417 --> 09:45.183
you ain't supposed to be
helping me. Lloyd, help!

09:45.185 --> 09:46.418
Stay down, Vic!

09:46.420 --> 09:47.852
Just stay down!

09:47.854 --> 09:48.920
Nigga, I'm-a get up,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.522
and I'm-a kick
your (bleep) ass.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.557
BOONIE: Hey, Vic, I'm-a
post this online, boy.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.026
I'm-a make sure you don't
never get (bleep) again.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.361
FISH:
Nah, he don't get
no (bleep) already.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.029
Just give me a minute.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.533
Uh, uh, Vic, no offense, I-I got
another appointment to go to.

10:01.535 --> 10:02.867
Nigga, you ain't going nowhere.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.069
O-Okay. Hey, Vi-Vic.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.037
I-I'm not--
I'm gonna respect your space

10:06.039 --> 10:07.706
and never come here again, okay?

10:07.708 --> 10:08.940
We're gonna finish this fight.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.542
And you're gonna stop cheating.
(groans)

10:10.544 --> 10:11.576
Let's just call
it a draw.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.211
Matter of fact,
you won.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.446
You won, Vic!

10:14.448 --> 10:16.715
Congratulations!

10:16.717 --> 10:18.717
Hey, Jee, Tray, I'll
see you at the crib.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.951
BOONIE: All right,
Big Tray, be cool.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.886
TRAYVON: All right,
uh, bye, Dad.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.055
VIC:
Say, nigga, where you going?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.457
This ain't over yet.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.459
Hey, Vic, you
want some water?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.395
Get your (bleep)
hands off me!

10:30.397 --> 10:33.632
From now on, Big Tray

10:33.634 --> 10:36.434
is banned from the complex
for eternity.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.802
For eternity!

10:40.072 --> 10:42.307
Yeah, yeah, that's it
right there, y'all, right there!

10:42.309 --> 10:43.608
That'll work perfect!

10:43.610 --> 10:44.809
Yeah, Tray,
look at that, man.

10:44.811 --> 10:48.246
See, Moms thinks
she the only one

10:48.248 --> 10:49.581
who could throw
a culturally sensitive,

10:49.583 --> 10:51.783
ethnically themed party.
(chuckles)

10:51.785 --> 10:53.752
Hey, what kind of beer
them Chinese (bleep) like?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.086
TRAYVON:
Uh, I don't know.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.088
Hey, guys,
we got about 50 people coming.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.923
I mean, at 12 bucks a head,
that's...

10:58.925 --> 11:00.091
That's $1,500!

11:00.093 --> 11:01.426
No, it's $600.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.761
It's all good, though, man.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.262
I ain't gonna lie, Boonie, man,

11:04.264 --> 11:05.463
this was a good idea.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.799
JESUS: Hey, what
happened to the picture?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.267
It's off, man.
Fix it!

11:09.269 --> 11:10.635
VIC:
That's right!

11:10.637 --> 11:12.937
Your janky-ass cable
just been shut off!

11:12.939 --> 11:16.441
Ain't gonna be no fight night
tonight, (bleep) fellas!

11:16.443 --> 11:18.677
And, oh, yeah, Fish,
if you decide

11:18.679 --> 11:20.278
to get real cable installed,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.513
make sure you call me up,

11:21.515 --> 11:23.515
so I can get ten percent.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.786
Man, come on in, y'all.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.454
Just want
to have some fun, man.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.622
Ol' hatin' ass, man.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.824
He always hatin'
on something, man.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.660
All right, man, right now
we got to weigh out our options.

11:35.662 --> 11:39.464
We got about two hours
before folks start showing up.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.966
Look, no, there are
no options, okay?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.501
No cable, no fight.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.703
It's simple.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.204
Quit being
so damn negative, man!

11:46.206 --> 11:48.306
I know you could hook
that shit up if you want to.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.542
You're always playing with all
them electronics and shit.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.043
What?! No way!

11:52.045 --> 11:53.511
I am not going up there!

11:53.513 --> 11:54.813
It's totally dangerous.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.147
There are high voltage
wires up there.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.148
But you could.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.149
I know your pops done taught you

11:58.151 --> 11:59.184
some of that stuff.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.719
Well, I mean, maybe.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.721
But it-it's a terrible idea.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.023
Okay, I mean, yeah, I helped him
do it a couple of times,

12:05.025 --> 12:06.691
but that doesn't
make me an expert.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.893
Hey, look, Tray,
I hear your concerns and all,

12:08.895 --> 12:11.062
but right now
we're facing about 50 people

12:11.064 --> 12:12.497
on the way to see a fight party,

12:12.499 --> 12:13.998
and we got to give them one.
Come on, Tray.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.834
We got to reconnect the cable,
and you're the only one

12:15.836 --> 12:17.736
that can do it, man.
I believe in you, brah.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.671
What about Vic?
Man, (bleep) Vic!

12:19.673 --> 12:22.507
Vic can't be in two
places at once, man.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.676
And plus, he having
his own fight party,

12:24.678 --> 12:26.344
so he ain't
worried about us.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.579
Tray, look.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.180
We'll put Jason
on the lookout.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.915
So when Vic and the cable
dude leave the roof,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.917
we can throw you up there,
you hook that shit up,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.919
and bam-- no problem.
Jesus, listen.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.721
You know something
could happen to me.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.022
Like, you know this, right?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.525
I hope the fight
is that important to you.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.260
Are you listening to me?

12:43.195 --> 12:44.562
Oh, yeah, yeah, Tray.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.597
Hey, hey, is there
some Loops in there, Fish?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.031
Go help yourself.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.533
Hook it up, Tray.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.735
(sighs)
Trayvon, look, man.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.538
This is your chance to
be a team player, baby.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.706
We down by one point.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.207
You're on the free throw line

12:56.209 --> 12:57.542
with no time on the clock.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.678
If there's no time,
we already lost.

13:05.885 --> 13:09.220
BOONIE:
<i>All right, welcome, welcome</i>

13:09.222 --> 13:10.789
to the fight of the century!

13:10.791 --> 13:12.724
$12, please.
(chuckles)

13:12.726 --> 13:14.058
Hey, have your money ready.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.260
I do not have change,
so don't ask.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.795
Consider it a donation.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.230
No outside beverages. My man
Jason selling drinks right here.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.566
We'll take care of you.
We got you.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.901
All right, so check it out--
what we do,

13:22.903 --> 13:25.570
we got two separate
but equal viewing areas.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.738
Over here, this is

13:26.740 --> 13:28.072
the Jackson side
of the fight.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.908
And for all you Asiatic,

13:29.910 --> 13:33.077
Filipino (bleep), this is
the Santos side right here.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.779
Now, if you're
black and Filipino mixed,

13:34.781 --> 13:36.915
your rope-side selection
will be chosen

13:36.917 --> 13:39.651
based off the straightness
of your hair.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.952
Hey, girl, get your ass
over here, goddamn it.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.253
You ain't fooling anybody

13:42.255 --> 13:43.488
with that Brazilian weave.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.756
Don't worry.
We got the fight coming on

13:44.758 --> 13:46.958
in a few seconds;
just bear with us.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.626
All right.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.828
I think it's the purple one.
Come on, Tray.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.262
Let's get this cracking.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.597
How we do?

13:52.599 --> 13:53.932
We got a couple more coming.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.166
But we're doing a'ight so far.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.101
All right, boy, this
shit cool, goddamn it.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.269
Be careful, Tray.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.604
No, I think I got it.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.172
(Tray screams)
Tray!

14:01.174 --> 14:03.908
(crowd gasping, clamoring)

14:12.117 --> 14:13.284
No, Tray!

14:13.286 --> 14:15.553
Come on, Tray!
Is he dead?

14:17.623 --> 14:19.524
Yeah, he dead.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.159
WOMAN:
He's dead.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.994
Come on, Tray, man,
come on, man!

14:22.996 --> 14:25.129
My bad, it wasn't supposed
to go down like that, brah!

14:25.131 --> 14:27.298
You get a do-over, homie.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.200
(gasping)

14:29.202 --> 14:32.036
He alive!
He alive!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.304
Hey, the fight on!

14:33.306 --> 14:36.140
(cheering, clamoring)

14:36.142 --> 14:38.643
Did I just, should
I have just died?

14:38.645 --> 14:39.978
Yeah, just for a hot minute.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.713
But-but look at you, man!
You're back, man!

14:41.715 --> 14:42.814
And guess what.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.315
The fight's on, homie!

14:44.317 --> 14:46.217
You did that!

14:49.722 --> 14:52.657
(cheering, clamoring)

14:52.659 --> 14:54.659
Bow! Bow! Bow! Poom!

14:54.661 --> 14:56.828
Muhammad Ali was
the baddest boxer of them all.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.162
He'd put the rope-a-dope on you!

14:58.164 --> 15:00.064
He'd be like this--
blip, blip, blip...

15:00.066 --> 15:01.499
I'm gonna step out
for a second.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.500
Keep having a good time.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.003
Son of a bitch!
Pow! Poom!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.204
Look at this!
Come on, y'all, listen!

15:06.206 --> 15:07.405
Look at that!
Can you see that?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.340
(all shouting)

15:09.342 --> 15:11.109
(all cheering, clamoring)

15:21.020 --> 15:22.854
Hey!

15:22.856 --> 15:25.089
What's all this shit?!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.027
Nigga, this is our fight party!

15:29.029 --> 15:30.862
And there ain't shit
you could do about it, either,

15:30.864 --> 15:32.597
'cause this ain't
the complex grounds.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.866
Ain't complex grounds, huh?

15:34.868 --> 15:36.601
Guess it's out of
my jurisdiction.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.370
Well, that cable
box on the roof?

15:39.372 --> 15:41.306
That's my jurisdiction.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.877
(cheering, clamoring)

15:45.879 --> 15:47.745
JESUS:
Vic.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.948
Vic, man, come on, man!

15:49.950 --> 15:52.383
Vic, man, Vic, man!
Come on, man, look at you!

15:52.385 --> 15:54.285
Man, why you got to act
like that all the time, man?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.920
Look, man, you're
fresh to def, man,

15:55.922 --> 15:58.089
dipped in butter with your
handmade African outfit.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.224
You got your Vegas-themed
party popping, man.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.893
But you're hating
on us so hard,

16:01.895 --> 16:03.461
you can't even enjoy
your own shit, Vic.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.562
Why, man?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.597
Somebody got
to enforce the rules.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.466
Stealing cable is wrong.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.902
Okay, Vic, I know the whole
"Thou shalt not steal" thing,

16:10.904 --> 16:12.236
but you know we
don't get down

16:12.238 --> 16:13.738
with the big cable
companies, man.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.573
They use unfair
business practices

16:15.575 --> 16:17.241
and got shitty
customer service, Vic!

16:17.243 --> 16:19.644
It ain't just
about the cable company.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.080
It's about the fighters, too.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.315
They're risking their life
to put on a show.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.918
They worked all their life
for that match.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.088
And they get a percentage
of the pay-per-view.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.324
So when you steal cable,
you're stealing from them.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.426
And when you steal from them,
you might as well

16:35.428 --> 16:38.162
be taking food right out
their children's mouth.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.998
I-I didn't think about
it like that, Vic, man.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.632
Yeah, I bet you didn't.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.468
And I'm gonna change the minds
of them other fools

16:43.470 --> 16:44.936
you've been hanging out with
when I go up here

16:44.938 --> 16:47.271
and shut
this janky-ass cable off.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.307
Hey, Vic, man, be careful, man!
Don't hurt yourself, man!

16:49.309 --> 16:51.976
You're gonna (bleep) up your
Nairobi nightclub outfit!

16:51.978 --> 16:53.778
Get your hands off me,
con man.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.347
Nigga, I'll stomp your fingers.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.182
Vic, man, be careful, man.
Don't-don't do that.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.852
Get down, Vic!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.455
Oh, hey, what's up, Tray?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.790
You cool?
You want a beer?

17:05.792 --> 17:07.458
No, I'm not cool, okay?

17:07.460 --> 17:08.793
I just F-in' died!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.862
Man, you just
kind of died.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.130
How do you "kind of" die, Fish?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.965
I was dead!
I was dead!

17:13.967 --> 17:16.034
All because you guys wanted
to see the stupid fight.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.803
What's up, Tray?
You all right?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.471
No! I was dead!
I'm not all right!

17:20.473 --> 17:22.340
Aw, come on, man, it was only,
like, a minute, man.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.509
I died for three days.
You think you're an angel.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.145
That's why God killed
you-- for trying so hard.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.680
Exactly, I do everything you
guys want me to do, okay?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.315
But dying for the fight
is too much!

17:31.317 --> 17:33.718
(crowd clamoring)
(Vic yells)

17:33.720 --> 17:35.353
(crowd gasps)

17:35.355 --> 17:37.822
JESUS:
Vic got shocked!

17:37.824 --> 17:39.857
Hey, Vic got the fight, too!

17:39.859 --> 17:42.226
Hey, y'all, come on!
(crowd clamoring)

17:53.505 --> 17:54.839
(pounding)
Who is it?

17:54.841 --> 17:57.341
Give me a push, young lady.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.077
Hold on a minute.
Who is it?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.012
Damn fool...
(crowd clamoring)

18:01.014 --> 18:02.713
If you ain't on the guest list,

18:02.715 --> 18:03.881
you Negroes should
get on out of here!

18:03.883 --> 18:05.216
Hey!
What is this?

18:05.218 --> 18:07.351
A parade?
What is this?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.087
You're going the wrong way!
Go back the other way!

18:09.089 --> 18:10.254
Hey!

18:10.256 --> 18:13.357
My...
Thank you, Jesus.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
Thank you.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.728
You're welcome, Vic.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.364
(grunting)

18:20.366 --> 18:22.834
(groans)

18:25.237 --> 18:26.404
(grunts)

18:26.406 --> 18:29.440
Ah, I like hamburgers.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.387
680, 690, 710...

18:43.389 --> 18:45.389
$720!

18:45.391 --> 18:47.892
Hey, I can't believe it, man.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.560
Something actually worked out.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.295
Hey, well, homies, you know, uh,

18:51.297 --> 18:53.231
I hate to be the one
to piss on the parade,

18:53.233 --> 18:55.900
but you know we got to return
some of that bread

18:55.902 --> 18:58.236
back to Jackson and Santos.
For what?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.770
I mean, Vic gamed me
up from an entirely

18:59.772 --> 19:01.405
different perspective, man.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.307
You know, we kind of stole
from them dudes last night.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.942
Do you have any idea
how much money

19:04.944 --> 19:07.078
them niggas already have?
Don't matter, Fish.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.746
Right is right
and wrong is wrong.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.914
You don't want nobody

19:09.916 --> 19:11.649
to steal from you, do you?
A'ight.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.251
I guess they can share a piece.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.585
Tray?

19:14.587 --> 19:17.155
Your boy about to finay to
the stinore real quick, man.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.591
You want me to grab you
a couple of thinangs?

19:20.593 --> 19:21.659
Say what?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.127
I said I'm about

19:23.129 --> 19:25.263
to go to the store for you.
You want something?

19:25.265 --> 19:28.099
You're going to get something
from the store for me?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.935
I mean, no one's ever
really asked me that before.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.137
Well, I'm asking
you now, young man.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.438
Uh...

19:34.440 --> 19:37.475
uh... okay, um,

19:37.477 --> 19:40.344
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
let me get a, let me get

19:40.346 --> 19:43.181
a bag of Doritos, uh,
a pack of Mentos if they got it.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.449
Wait, do I have to pay?
'Cause I don't have any...

19:45.451 --> 19:46.450
Oh, nah.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.119
It's on me.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.620
I got you.
(chuckles)

19:49.622 --> 19:51.455
TRAYVON:
Oh, okay.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.791
Well, yeah, in that case,
um, I-I'll take some Loops

19:53.793 --> 19:55.660
with-with some milk,
paper towels,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.461
Tabasco sauce,
some Spam.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.797
Get some avocados, I'll make you
guys sandwiches and everything.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.632
I got you.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.301
Thanks, Jesus.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.303
Ah!
You see that?

20:05.305 --> 20:08.306
I feel like a superhero,
you know?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.408
(laughter)
Oh, yeah!
