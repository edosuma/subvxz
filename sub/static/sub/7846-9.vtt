of the seven summits,

00:09.619 --> 00:12.096
Neverrest has claimed
the world's finest explorers.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.661
But this area's uncharted. How
did you know this would be here?

11:29.778 --> 11:34.532
Uh, guys, I don't think we're the
first climbers to have this idea.

11:36.106 --> 11:37.147
Whoa.

11:37.954 --> 11:39.922
Where are their heads?

11:40.168 --> 11:41.540
Found 'em!

11:42.352 --> 11:45.825
Uh, maybe we find
a slightly less deadly cave.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.372
Wait, the entrance
was right here.

11:49.438 --> 11:50.572
We must've gotten
turned around.

11:50.629 --> 11:51.654
It's gotta
be here somewhere!

12:00.120 --> 12:01.214
Is that...

12:01.291 --> 12:02.893
George Mallardy.

12:03.029 --> 12:06.096
Greatest mountaineer
of the 20th century.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.752
Wait, he's written something
out on the wall here.

12:09.986 --> 12:12.171
"Curse you, McDuck."

12:14.643 --> 12:17.062
Ach, jinx. If I had a nickel
for every person

12:17.120 --> 12:18.636
who cursed me
with their dying breath,

12:18.694 --> 12:20.500
I'd be as rich
as I already am.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.311
Junior Woodchuck
Rule 1118...

12:22.388 --> 12:26.101
A Woodchuck chief must always
be honest with his crew.

12:26.235 --> 12:28.084
Fine. Ugh.

12:28.429 --> 12:31.000
I was the Neverrest Ninny.

12:31.281 --> 12:32.515
- What?  - What?
- What?

12:32.757 --> 12:35.085
Seventy-five years
ago today,

12:35.343 --> 12:38.656
<i>I hired Mallardy
to lead me up the mountain.</i>

12:39.166 --> 12:40.843
<i>I'd just made
my first million,</i>

12:40.941 --> 12:42.336
<i>and I wanted to mark
the occasion</i>

12:42.394 --> 12:44.904
<i>by doing something
no one had ever done.</i>

12:45.124 --> 12:47.676
<i>I may have been
a little inexperienced,</i>

12:47.734 --> 12:50.523
<i>but I didn't want
to leave anything to chance.</i>

12:53.659 --> 12:56.570
<i>Mallardy mocked me
mercilessly.</i>

12:58.789 --> 13:00.625
<i>He ordered me
to lighten my load,</i>

13:00.695 --> 13:03.522
<i>but I was afraid to risk
my emergency supplies</i>

13:03.828 --> 13:05.883
<i>and my sizeable money belt,</i>

13:06.327 --> 13:07.867
<i>so he cut me loose.</i>

13:08.015 --> 13:09.535
<i>I was weighed down
by doubt</i>

13:09.605 --> 13:12.191
<i>and branded
the Neverrest Ninny.</i>

13:13.283 --> 13:15.875
Mallardy was never
heard from again.

13:16.236 --> 13:20.200
But he became the man to make it
the farthest up the mountain!

13:23.540 --> 13:25.059
Now he's the second farthest!

13:25.117 --> 13:26.340
Uncle Scrooge!

13:26.398 --> 13:28.261
What? He was
a backstabbing braggart

13:28.338 --> 13:29.432
who almost
got me killed!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.170
I think the mountain
got even for you.

13:31.247 --> 13:34.253
And now we'll get even
with the mountain!

13:34.330 --> 13:38.047
We will brave the new frontier,
chart the unknown!

13:38.105 --> 13:41.277
How can I chart the unknown if I
don't know what I'm charting!

13:41.467 --> 13:44.187
I'm telling you, this mountain
doesn't make any sense.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.475
I think I hear the wind
coming from this way.

13:46.552 --> 13:47.520
Webby, wait!

13:47.578 --> 13:49.152
Good initiative,
Webbigail!

13:49.229 --> 13:50.359
Thanks, Mr. McDuck!

13:51.578 --> 13:53.156
Didn't you just...
Weren't you...?

13:53.233 --> 13:54.539
I found an opening.

13:54.641 --> 13:56.236
Lead the way!

14:00.826 --> 14:02.255
- Whoo-hoo!
- We made it!

14:02.332 --> 14:04.076
We should be closer
than ever now.

14:04.148 --> 14:05.576
Is that Bunny Rock?

14:06.456 --> 14:09.512
Aw, come on!

14:10.131 --> 14:13.076
The ice fever
in final stages.

14:13.369 --> 14:16.592
Must stay warm.

14:18.177 --> 14:19.568
Uh, Launchpad?

14:19.654 --> 14:22.146
So warm!

14:22.537 --> 14:24.271
Launchpad!

14:25.498 --> 14:27.724
Louie, is that you?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.724
Stay calm,
little buddy.

14:29.787 --> 14:31.520
We need to find a way
off this mountain

14:31.597 --> 14:33.545
before ice fever
takes us both.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.927
You know ice fever
is not a thing, right?

14:36.029 --> 14:38.795
You're talking crazy.
You must have it, too.

14:38.927 --> 14:41.482
Crazy talk is the third stage
of ice fever!

14:41.615 --> 14:42.643
Who told you that?

14:42.701 --> 14:44.787
The guy who sold me
this blanket.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.332
Standard double snake oil.
I see how it is.

14:47.457 --> 14:49.623
Well, no one cons
my family but me!

14:49.748 --> 14:52.251
Our combined body heat
will save us both.

14:52.328 --> 14:54.498
Soak in the wetness
of my sweat!

14:54.631 --> 14:57.131
Ew! So much wetness! Ew!

15:03.644 --> 15:04.999
At last!

15:05.057 --> 15:08.394
After all these years,
the summit of Mount Neverrest!

15:08.514 --> 15:10.074
We're in the clear
now, kids!

15:10.132 --> 15:11.678
Ha-ha!

15:19.941 --> 15:22.439
That's it!
I'm putting my foot down.

15:22.517 --> 15:23.892
We can't go forward!

15:23.962 --> 15:26.204
Of course we can.
The summit's right there!

15:26.269 --> 15:29.339
We are violating every rule
of my Junior Woodchuck training!

15:29.418 --> 15:31.002
We're out of supplies,
it's starting to get cold,

15:31.059 --> 15:32.113
so even if we make it
to the top,

15:32.171 --> 15:33.838
we'd freeze to death
before we get down.

15:33.947 --> 15:35.826
Oh, and if we keep trying
to go up this way,

15:35.884 --> 15:38.150
the whole thing
is gonna come crashing down!

15:38.208 --> 15:39.487
This is all too risky!

15:39.545 --> 15:41.434
Don't you go ninny
on me, lad!

15:41.511 --> 15:43.819
You'll never get your cartography
badge with that attitude!

15:43.876 --> 15:46.892
I don't care!
We have to turn around now!

15:47.032 --> 15:48.441
- Now!
- Now!

15:48.587 --> 15:50.519
You already beat Mallardy.
Isn't that enough?

15:50.596 --> 15:54.217
No! We'd be daft to give up
with the peak in our grasp.

15:54.275 --> 15:57.220
It's not giving up.
It's just having common sense.

15:57.433 --> 16:01.530
For the last time,
nothing bad is going to happen!

16:01.607 --> 16:03.533
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

16:04.223 --> 16:06.953
Dewey! Webby!

16:07.011 --> 16:08.581
Kids!

16:12.542 --> 16:14.047
How'd you guys
get up there?

16:14.219 --> 16:16.141
I don't know.

16:17.693 --> 16:20.646
Maybe Launchpad
was right about ice fever.

16:25.974 --> 16:28.021
What are you...
Ow! What?

16:28.323 --> 16:31.591
What the blistering bagpipes
is going on here?

16:31.662 --> 16:32.846
Wormholes!

16:32.904 --> 16:34.455
This mountain
is covered in some kind

16:34.513 --> 16:35.755
of mystical
dimensional doorways

16:35.873 --> 16:38.183
that have been randomly zapping
us around the trail all day!

16:38.240 --> 16:39.377
Between the fog
and the snow,

16:39.435 --> 16:40.482
we didn't
even realize it!

16:40.540 --> 16:42.295
That's why my map
didn't make sense!

16:42.439 --> 16:46.540
Hoots, man! A mountain protecting
its peak with portals!

16:46.656 --> 16:50.659
Neverrest, you beauteous beaut,
you never cease to amaze.

16:50.736 --> 16:52.752
And you wanted
to turn around!

16:55.859 --> 16:57.086
What are you doing?

16:57.144 --> 16:59.445
We're at the top
of a magical mystery mountain!

16:59.546 --> 17:01.511
I gotta find my sled,
like, now!

17:01.569 --> 17:03.574
- Yes!
- Whoa!

17:04.719 --> 17:06.101
What?

17:08.518 --> 17:09.692
Hmm...

17:10.165 --> 17:11.492
Oh, that...

17:11.550 --> 17:12.605
Whoa!

17:16.309 --> 17:18.560
- Whoa-ho-ho!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:18.851 --> 17:22.772
I'm getting nudges!
Are you getting nudges?

17:23.178 --> 17:24.539
My brain hurts!

17:24.606 --> 17:25.922
You know what I mean?

17:27.617 --> 17:30.333
Careful! The more
you zap around,

17:30.410 --> 17:32.510
the less stable
this ice fall becomes!

17:35.665 --> 17:37.586
Hey, my sled!

17:37.920 --> 17:39.506
Hmm...

17:40.420 --> 17:42.438
I don't have
to climb the icefall.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.668
I just to find the wormhole
that sled fell through.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.598
Uncle Scrooge, no!

17:51.681 --> 17:53.624
Ha-ha! I'm gonna do it!

17:53.733 --> 17:58.113
Mount Neverrest,
consider yourself conquered!

17:59.668 --> 18:01.098
Conquered!

18:01.704 --> 18:03.630
Conquered!

18:05.655 --> 18:06.934
Conquered!

18:12.211 --> 18:15.065
Just stop!
There's no way to reach the top.

18:15.123 --> 18:16.342
The mountain won't let you!

18:16.431 --> 18:17.784
Let this one go!

18:17.842 --> 18:19.552
Look how far we've come!

18:19.629 --> 18:22.178
Farther than anyone has ever made it.
Isn't that enough?

18:22.342 --> 18:26.193
I will not be the Neverrest
Ninny for another 75 years!

18:26.333 --> 18:29.490
Nobody has used the word
"ninny" in 75 years!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.826
Junior Woodchuck Rule 727:

18:33.928 --> 18:38.350
"Sometimes the bravest thing an
explorer can do is walk away."

18:59.419 --> 19:01.082
- Now?
- Now!

19:01.202 --> 19:02.539
No!

19:06.881 --> 19:08.426
Hang on, kiddos!

19:11.591 --> 19:13.082
Oh! Whoa!

19:37.149 --> 19:38.406
Whoo!

19:41.711 --> 19:42.781
Whoo!

19:50.537 --> 19:52.368
Aah! Whoo.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.471
Ooh. Of course, if you
really want to survive in style,

19:58.533 --> 20:01.084
you'll need something from our
Mallardy Selects Collection.

20:01.142 --> 20:05.416
You! Are you the man who sold my
friend all this useless equipment?

20:05.474 --> 20:07.283
Eh...

20:07.443 --> 20:10.806
Look at him!
He's dying of ice fever!

20:10.978 --> 20:14.696
All the overpriced junk
you sold him did nothing!

20:17.476 --> 20:19.525
No, no,
that's impossible.

20:19.659 --> 20:21.510
Tell that
to this poor man!

20:21.568 --> 20:23.572
I see a bright light.
This is it!

20:23.739 --> 20:26.158
Louie, marry me
among the clouds.

20:26.985 --> 20:28.641
He's delirious!

20:28.718 --> 20:30.252
No, he's an idiot.

20:30.310 --> 20:31.877
He's not dying
of ice fever.

20:31.971 --> 20:33.646
Ice fever
isn't real!

20:35.135 --> 20:38.887
Um, maybe just
sort of not real?

20:49.462 --> 20:50.700
You saved me!

20:50.758 --> 20:52.873
You carried me down the
mountain singlehandedly,

20:52.938 --> 20:54.617
then cured me
of ice fever!

20:54.694 --> 20:56.068
Sure. Yeah. Why not?

20:56.583 --> 20:57.750
We survived!

20:57.827 --> 20:59.341
Take that,
Mount Neverrest!

20:59.399 --> 21:01.705
You won't claim
our bodies today!

21:20.013 --> 21:22.529
So, that's sledding, huh?

21:23.081 --> 21:24.179
Meh.

21:24.341 --> 21:26.404
Sorry we didn't make it
to the top, Uncle Scrooge.

21:26.521 --> 21:30.341
Ah, tell you, buddy, there's more
to Neverrest than just a mountain,

21:30.528 --> 21:33.878
and there's more to us than just a
couple of ninnies who couldn't climb it.

21:38.795 --> 21:41.957
Plenty more adventures
where that came from, eh, lad?

21:42.607 --> 21:45.248
Now, where the blazes
is that hot cocoa stand?

21:45.306 --> 21:46.852
I am freezing!
