00:40.520 --> 00:44.880
I have this memory of me and my mother.
We are walking along the beach.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.200
It was stormy,
the wind was thrashing over the water,

00:50.400 --> 00:54.080
making the waves threatening and scary.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.400
But I was not scared, I felt safe.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.920
But then suddenly a wind
gust threw me to the ground,

01:03.640 --> 01:07.360
my mother came running over quickly,
but instead of crying I had to laugh.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.440
I laughed so loud
that my mother started laughing, too.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.040
Then I got up,
stretched my arms far from me

01:16.160 --> 01:18.080
and waited for the next gust.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.000
I will miss you.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.560
Everything's blurry!

02:13.080 --> 02:14.160
Thank you!

02:15.360 --> 02:17.440
That one's for me!

02:21.080 --> 02:22.520
Do that...

02:23.360 --> 02:24.880
with South Korea!

02:27.800 --> 02:29.040
Sure!

02:31.080 --> 02:32.240
Really!

02:39.480 --> 02:41.280
I mean it!

02:41.920 --> 02:44.000
It will be good for you!

02:45.080 --> 02:46.600
I will.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.680
Bye!

03:10.400 --> 03:13.800
Break free more often!

03:40.080 --> 03:43.080
That one I have already.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.280
What do you think?

03:46.640 --> 03:48.040
Exactly!

03:49.800 --> 03:52.160
Five more minutes!

03:52.360 --> 03:53.880
Whaaat?!

03:54.080 --> 03:55.880
You will manage!

03:55.960 --> 03:57.760
No!

04:13.080 --> 04:14.400
Thanks!

04:19.480 --> 04:20.720
What?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.560
Ok, I'll show you!

04:26.320 --> 04:28.800
I am currently bidding on eBay!

04:29.080 --> 04:31.200
A caravan?

04:32.080 --> 04:35.080
We are now at 2000€.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
2500 is my limit!

04:37.080 --> 04:38.400
Nice!

04:38.720 --> 04:44.840
- Kitchen included?!
- Yes, but I have to fix it up a little.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.320
Fingers crossed!

04:50.440 --> 04:53.440
- Where are you traveling?
- The Balkans!

04:54.360 --> 04:57.040
A culinary journey!

04:57.160 --> 05:00.560
Wherever it smells nice,
I will stop and eat with the people there.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.560
I'm jealous!

05:03.800 --> 05:07.040
I will collect all the recipes
and maybe write a cookbook.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.480
What are your plans?

05:10.840 --> 05:15.160
I actually wanted to go to South Korea,
for our 5th anniversary.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.040
My boyfriend thinks it's too expensive.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.560
Five years, already!?

05:21.880 --> 05:25.400
I still have to convince him!

05:26.080 --> 05:29.880
Well, you better don't waste time then!

05:31.560 --> 05:35.360
Well, there will be three of you soon,
right?

05:44.360 --> 05:47.360
Lilli says it's time.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.040
Who is Lilli?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.720
My ovulation assistant.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
- Aha!?
- You are ovulating!

05:54.160 --> 05:55.160
Now!

05:56.080 --> 05:57.320
Again?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.480
Should we?

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
We are eating!

06:03.200 --> 06:06.240
Come one, let's do it.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.800
- Oh no.
- Come on!

06:16.440 --> 06:17.680
No.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.680
No family planning?

06:22.080 --> 06:24.120
I'm planning nothing!

07:49.560 --> 07:53.920
Mum was so much tougher on me than you.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.320
Maybe I wasn't that easy.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.920
Jumping on the table,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.480
screaming for attention.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.640
That I can imagine.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.880
- You spilled.
- Shit!

08:08.800 --> 08:12.000
We now have this babysitter!

08:12.160 --> 08:15.000
The hourly rate is 11€

08:15.160 --> 08:17.160
11 Euros!?

08:17.400 --> 08:21.200
We could look after him?

08:21.480 --> 08:24.320
No problem at all!

08:24.720 --> 08:28.960
Actually, I have a lot to
do for school at the moment.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.760
I think it would be better...

08:32.720 --> 08:38.320
Just bring him along!
I can handle him.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.360
I really don't want to bother you now,

08:41.400 --> 08:44.159
but it really would help.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.880
- I don't know?
- But it has nothing to do with you!

08:48.000 --> 08:50.160
- I will take care of the baby.
- Yes, but...

08:50.360 --> 08:53.080
You will probably need my help.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.160
I can manage, thank you!

08:57.080 --> 08:59.400
And with you guys?

09:00.080 --> 09:03.080
When is something happening there?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.400
What?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.320
Well, a baby!

09:06.440 --> 09:08.160
That would be great!

09:08.320 --> 09:10.240
Well look, Leo is one now

09:10.360 --> 09:13.080
and if they were two years apart,
that would be fantastic.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.400
Should we tell her?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.600
Sure.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.720
We have been trying for a while now.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.960
- Really?
- Yes.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.720
Wait a minute, we are not pregnant yet!

09:38.680 --> 09:40.400
I am so happy!

09:40.720 --> 09:43.040
You're in the perfect age!

09:43.280 --> 09:44.840
Since when?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.080
For three months now?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.200
For three months you’ve been trying?

09:49.760 --> 09:54.360
I’ve stopped taking the pill now,
but I’ve taken it for so long,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.080
it takes some time...

09:56.240 --> 09:58.120
The body has to readjust!

09:58.320 --> 10:01.320
How often do you have sex?

10:02.160 --> 10:04.040
You don't have to answer!

10:05.120 --> 10:08.800
Often!
Like...normal...

10:12.240 --> 10:14.240
Good morning!

10:16.200 --> 10:19.600
- I hope you all had a nice weekend?
- Yes!

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
What did you have for breakfast?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.560
What did you have Mara?

10:23.800 --> 10:24.920
Cereal.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.720
And you?

10:28.280 --> 10:33.640
A chocolate roll with applesauce
and strawberries.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.320
Our new topic is nutrition!

10:37.560 --> 10:41.320
I already noticed you all
eat sweet things for breakfast

10:41.520 --> 10:44.240
let's talk about sugar.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.560
What things have sugar in them?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.400
Chocolate!

10:51.560 --> 10:53.080
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream!

10:53.200 --> 10:54.520
Ketchup?

10:55.560 --> 10:57.920
That's right!

10:58.080 --> 11:02.320
I want to show you a food pyramid.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.040
Maria can you
draw the food pyramid for us?

11:07.160 --> 11:11.280
I have this chewing gum and it
says 'without sugar'.

11:12.520 --> 11:17.080
Have a nice afternoon,
see you tomorrow!

11:27.800 --> 11:30.040
And she tripped?

11:31.760 --> 11:35.000
She always has something!

11:38.080 --> 11:39.080
Hello!

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
Hey.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.920
What a surprise!

11:45.120 --> 11:47.320
How wonderful to see you.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.080
How are you?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.520
My Darling.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.800
Hello, I’m Charlie.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.520
Oh, the granddaughter.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.840
- Luca!
- And this is my granddaughter!

12:01.160 --> 12:03.720
She's studying to be a vet.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.720
She is quite ambitious.

12:07.640 --> 12:12.240
My granddaughter is already a very good teacher,

12:12.640 --> 12:16.240
Take her as a role model, then!

12:18.600 --> 12:19.800
Yeah!

12:20.000 --> 12:24.520
I will go get a coffee,
would you like some?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.000
No, thanks!

12:26.080 --> 12:27.440
I will join you.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.200
- Do you want a coffee?
- No!

12:30.880 --> 12:33.040
I brought you something!

12:36.480 --> 12:37.560
Grandmothers!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.760
Yeah, grandmothers.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.400
They just keep getting crazier.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.480
She still lives alone?

12:47.680 --> 12:52.920
Yeah, but after the accident...

12:53.400 --> 12:58.000
Crazy and fragile
don’t really fit together.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.560
I want to talk with my mom,
if granny could maybe live with her!

13:04.800 --> 13:07.480
Otherwise I'm worrying all the time.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.040
How's your grandmother doing?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.960
Will she be living with your parents, as well?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.280
Everything is fine at the moment.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.520
I don’t have any parents,
so she would probably live with me,

13:21.760 --> 13:25.560
or maybe live in a nursing home
or something like that.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.200
Hello?

13:38.240 --> 13:40.640
Charlie?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.080
You have to take him!

13:45.120 --> 13:49.320
There has been an emergency at work,
I have to go!

13:49.600 --> 13:53.240
The entire network broke down!

13:53.320 --> 13:55.680
I'm really sorry, Lio.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.040
Here, look!

14:06.280 --> 14:11.000
Ok, let's see how the kids managed today.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.440
No, stay here.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.880
Here, look!

14:19.920 --> 14:22.920
Wait!

14:24.880 --> 14:26.720
Don't...

14:30.600 --> 14:32.400
Hey, wait up!

14:42.400 --> 14:44.720
So many bubbles.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.040
Do you also want to see?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.120
Shit!

15:07.880 --> 15:10.480
No scissors!

15:12.320 --> 15:16.320
Oh, no, don’t cry!

15:17.080 --> 15:19.000
Here look at this.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.200
Charlie I'm so sorry.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.560
Really!

15:34.880 --> 15:37.720
I didn't know he would scream so much.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.520
Just for a second?

16:43.880 --> 16:45.400
Please?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.920
Can you please chew quietly!

17:45.880 --> 17:49.160
Have you decided about South Korea?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.880
What about South Korea?

17:57.880 --> 18:01.120
Didn’t we want to start
saving for our new flat?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.000
I can still live here.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.040
Whatever!

18:49.000 --> 18:52.120
Next stop, Alexanderplatz.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.640
Is something wrong?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.520
No, why?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.680
You keep staring.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.400
You looked first!

19:00.560 --> 19:02.800
- No, I didn’t...
- Yes, you did.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.480
No!

19:05.320 --> 19:08.360
Maybe I did look.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.520
I'm Marco.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.080
I'm not a criminal
or something like that.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.680
Sure?!

19:16.760 --> 19:19.640
- Want to see my ID?
- Yeah, show me!

19:19.880 --> 19:22.240
- Really?
- Yeah, go on.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.040
That's not you!
You stole it, didn’t you?

19:29.200 --> 19:32.800
No, that really is me!
Weird phase in my life.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.680
- Blonde hair?
- With strands.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.840
You don’t even look so bad with strands.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.680
- You think I don’t look that bad?
- I mean on the picture.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.160
You stare so long
and start changing things.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.720
Guilty as charged.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.520
What's your name?

19:50.880 --> 19:53.400
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.560
That's my stop.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.800
Wanna change numbers?

19:58.880 --> 20:02.640
017736574332, bye!

20:02.960 --> 20:05.760
Wait, you still have my ID!

20:50.880 --> 20:52.320
Please, listen!

20:52.400 --> 20:56.040
Don't forget your homework,
we will write a test about this.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.160
These ticks really piss me off,
must be a million of them here.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.480
Don't be such a crybaby.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.080
- Why are we here?!
- She said it's a surprise.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.800
Holy shit!

22:01.880 --> 22:04.480
How awesome is this?

22:04.720 --> 22:06.280
What took you so long?

22:06.440 --> 22:11.840
This is so cool, paintball.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.560
Are you serious?

22:15.880 --> 22:17.560
I won.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.360
For free.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.160
For three people!

22:23.640 --> 22:26.560
You don’t have to do everything
just because it's free.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.520
Of course you have to!

22:28.680 --> 22:31.760
Give me that!
For the whole family.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.800
It will be fun.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.680
Come on!

22:40.960 --> 22:42.720
I like it.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.960
Ok, let’s go.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.160
Grandma, this will hurt.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.160
Oh my...

22:54.880 --> 22:58.560
Go ladies, go go go!
Take cover!

22:59.880 --> 23:01.080
Careful!

23:05.400 --> 23:07.200
Grandma be careful!

23:09.080 --> 23:10.920
"Learning korean."

23:15.880 --> 23:17.440
Not so fast!

23:19.960 --> 23:23.680
- Stay calm!
- Shoot already!

23:24.760 --> 23:25.760
Shit.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.240
Coming over B.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.800
Flash grenade!

23:32.240 --> 23:34.520
- Charlie, not now!
- You are murdered.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.160
It's a tournament!

23:37.960 --> 23:39.360
Where are they?

23:44.880 --> 23:47.880
That looks shaky,
let me help you.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.680
It's not shaky at all.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.160
No it's fine!

24:07.880 --> 24:10.320
FUCK!

24:16.280 --> 24:23.280
Sorry, my bad,
I don’t know what's up with her.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.400
Yeah, I'll tell her.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.400
Are you okay?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.920
Exhausting, isn’t it?

24:56.920 --> 24:58.760
But fun!

25:20.880 --> 25:22.720
Yes, that's me.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.880
Mrs. Pfeiffer was admitted yesterday
after she had collapsed!

25:31.960 --> 25:35.720
She has been hospitalized and examined,
and now she is sleeping.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.160
- Is she in pain?
- No, we gave her some medication.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.560
She is just very weak at the moment.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.280
What happened?

25:43.720 --> 25:47.880
We had a suspicion for an ulcer.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.840
We did a gastroscopy and took samples.

25:52.160 --> 25:57.760
The samples are now in the laboratory.
It will take up to 3 or 4 days.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.960
Don’t forget the cat.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.280
Yes.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.920
Good.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.080
- Where are you right now?
- Gumok, Thailand.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.840
- So far already.
- It's so beautiful!

26:36.880 --> 26:40.920
White beaches, parties, the ocean.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.760
Sounds great!

26:42.880 --> 26:46.040
- When will you be coming?
- So much going on here.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.600
My grandmother is in hospital.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.760
I definitely want to come,

26:51.880 --> 26:55.040
I just need to wait
until she's better.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.640
Did you already book the trip?
In five weeks I will be in South Korea.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.760
Really?

27:00.080 --> 27:02.680
That would be so nice.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.480
Can I get a hug?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.520
Of course!

28:21.880 --> 28:23.800
Is something up?

28:33.320 --> 28:36.720
Are you happy?

28:43.240 --> 28:46.440
Maybe not at the moment,

28:48.880 --> 28:51.880
but yes I'm happy!

29:02.880 --> 29:04.960
Let's go dancing.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.480
- You don’t want to go dancing.
- Yes I do.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.200
You hate dancing.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.800
No, I want to dance with you.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.800
No really, I'm totally keen.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.960
Then we will go dancing
on the weekend.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.800
It was your idea!

29:25.080 --> 29:27.680
Yeah, let's do it.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.040
Charlie, I'm hungry.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.280
Let's eat something.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.600
I think back there was
a burger shop.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.120
I know a really good one.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.880
But we will have to take the train a bit.

30:10.920 --> 30:11.760
What?

30:11.840 --> 30:13.760
- With the subway.
- We just got here!

30:17.880 --> 30:19.960
It is nice here, isn’t it?

30:24.880 --> 30:26.720
Awesome!

30:26.880 --> 30:28.680
Really good!

30:31.880 --> 30:33.880
Do you like it?

30:42.880 --> 30:45.480
- Let's go dancing now!
- Hmm?

30:45.880 --> 30:48.000
Let's dance?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.800
Wait a minute.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.400
What is it?

31:18.680 --> 31:20.680
Heartburn.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.120
Do you want to go home?

31:42.240 --> 31:44.880
You have to decide.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.240
I'm still gonna go dancing!

32:14.880 --> 32:18.160
See you later.
Bye!

32:44.080 --> 32:45.080
Hello!

32:45.240 --> 32:47.600
Wow, did you scare me!

32:47.880 --> 32:51.200
Hey what are you doing here?

32:53.880 --> 32:58.680
- You are reading here, at the carnival?
- Yeah, I can't concentrate at home.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.160
And you? Having fun?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.920
Do you want a sip?

33:14.960 --> 33:16.680
Thanks.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.880
How is your grandmother?

33:21.960 --> 33:24.040
Don’t ask!

33:30.880 --> 33:33.240
Want to go drink something?

33:33.480 --> 33:34.200
Cocktails?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.880
Almost there!

34:20.120 --> 34:21.480
Third floor, traitor.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.480
You have hard buttocks.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.080
Thanks!

34:30.239 --> 34:33.239
It's so nice here.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.600
The rest you’ll have to do.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.000
I'm floating!

34:41.880 --> 34:43.520
The key?

34:46.880 --> 34:47.880
Hello!

34:48.239 --> 34:49.239
Hey.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.239
I’m Gerry.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.560
Sorry, I’m Marco.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.960
- Did you have a pleasant evening?
- Yeah.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.240
- It's alright!
- I’m sorry.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.400
I threw up on his shoulder.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.320
I am so sorry.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.880
Thanks for bringing her home.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.240
Thank you!

35:27.880 --> 35:29.880
Well, then...

35:29.880 --> 35:31.320
See you Monday.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.160
- See you Monday.
- Bye Marco!

35:34.280 --> 35:36.720
In School.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.880
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.400
Wait.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.920
Here.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.400
I need to lie down!

36:40.160 --> 36:41.760
Shit.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.960
Where are you?

37:10.880 --> 37:14.080
Everything is spinning.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.680
- Kiss.
- Sleep.

37:19.880 --> 37:20.880
Kiss.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.000
Morning!

37:57.240 --> 37:59.800
Are you hungover?

38:07.920 --> 38:10.360
Just take the pill then!

38:20.880 --> 38:23.960
You are doing it anyway, aren't you.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.040
Marco, please.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.800
I don’t feel so good.

38:30.880 --> 38:36.280
I’m so sorry that you don't feel so good.
Maybe you shouldn't drink all night.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.600
Will you say something please?

38:41.640 --> 38:44.280
- What?
- Say something!

38:46.920 --> 38:49.200
How do you think it
would be with a child?

38:49.280 --> 38:50.800
- Beautiful!
- Really.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.920
Yes, because you don't have
to do anything.

38:54.400 --> 38:58.680
Giving me the child of your sister
as soon as it starts crying a little bit.

38:58.960 --> 39:03.760
I would need to leave my job for 2 years, you know.
I've just started.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.880
That’s nature.
I can't change that?

39:06.880 --> 39:10.880
You want it,
but I need to sacrifice everything!

39:11.080 --> 39:17.400
I already have my grandmother
to take care of...

39:17.880 --> 39:21.120
and all my children in school.
You have no idea!

39:21.320 --> 39:23.000
Yeah, run away!

39:23.360 --> 39:26.080
How grown up of you.

39:39.880 --> 39:40.880
Hey.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.200
- I did it!
- What?

39:45.440 --> 39:47.880
I registered to be a teacher.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.880
Are you serious!

39:49.880 --> 39:51.680
Yeah, finally.

39:51.880 --> 39:56.000
And does it feel good?

39:56.280 --> 39:58.720
Not sure.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.040
It will be great.
You should do it.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.240
- Exactly what we talked about.
- Let's celebrate.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.560
Can you imagine me as a teacher?

40:06.680 --> 40:09.680
With these glasses maybe?

40:09.840 --> 40:12.960
You are good with children, right?

40:13.320 --> 40:16.880
I could always practice with you at home.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.880
Pretending to be a teacher?

40:19.200 --> 40:21.640
Lovely idea.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.480
Charlie is calling.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.760
- I'm going to answer it.
- No.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.440
Hello.

40:55.880 --> 41:01.880
Listen, Marco is with me,
but I think he needs a little distance.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.440
He will call you back.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.760
I don't want to get involved in this,
but maybe you should give him some space.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.920
But yeah, he will get back to you.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.120
Ok.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.120
Bye.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.320
Hello.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.680
My darling.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.840
- Hey.
- You're so sweet.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.240
How are you?

41:35.880 --> 41:38.040
- So so.
- So so?

41:38.960 --> 41:40.600
I brought you something.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.280
A little bit of sunshine.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.640
Beautiful!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.080
Thank you.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.400
I will go and get a vase.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.560
- You look better.
- Yeah?

41:59.320 --> 42:01.560
- I am so hungry.
- Hungry?

42:01.880 --> 42:03.640
That's a good sign.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.000
How is the hospital food?

42:06.880 --> 42:08.600
Tastes like shit.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.680
It's cold and has no taste.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.560
I could make you something.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.400
That would be nice.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.560
Chops or meatballs.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.880
Or goulash.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.320
- Hmmm, goulash.
- Goulash!?

42:26.880 --> 42:29.080
Red cabbage and dumplings.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.520
Dumplings.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.640
Ok, goulash, red cabbage and dumplings.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.480
Enjoy.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.840
Well.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.160
I will start with the dumplings.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.200
And?

43:28.880 --> 43:31.320
- Come on, tell me!
- Wait I still have to...

43:45.160 --> 43:46.160
Okay

43:49.080 --> 43:51.560
I'm completely honest now.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.000
It's awful.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.880
Don't...

44:01.320 --> 44:03.880
But it's not a big deal!

44:05.080 --> 44:08.240
Not everybody needs to be a good cook.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.000
That is my grandmother’s favourite dish.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.920
She made it for me already
when I was little.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.640
I know where they have the best dumplings.

44:36.080 --> 44:41.080
Ok, now we will eat.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.800
Hello!

44:55.880 --> 44:57.960
- Good day.
- Hello.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.480
And where is the restaurant?

45:04.880 --> 45:07.280
It is still a little bit.

45:09.880 --> 45:14.160
How far approximately,
we're hungry, aren’t we?

45:15.760 --> 45:18.160
About 500 miles.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.200
No, tell me.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.280
- I told you, 500 miles.
- No, really!

45:23.880 --> 45:25.440
Where are we going?

45:25.560 --> 45:28.720
Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia.

45:28.920 --> 45:31.000
- No.
- Yes.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.760
No, tell me.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.760
I am telling you.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.720
And why?

45:36.880 --> 45:39.000
Eat dumplings of course.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.920
Have you been there before, Lisbeth?

45:42.200 --> 45:45.880
We just picked her up from the hospital.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.880
We can't drive eight hours just for dumplings.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.920
Well, yes we can,
we are doing it.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.200
So.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.160
If you want to be really sad

46:05.200 --> 46:09.200
then do not invite your friends.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.080
It is best if you stay all alone

46:12.240 --> 46:15.240
and do not let anyone in.

46:15.880 --> 46:19.880
Ooh, never leave your room

46:19.880 --> 46:22.960
and you will see, it can get worse.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.840
Just cry to yourself quietly

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
and the whole world will agree.

46:31.880 --> 46:37.040
Self pity - the best time of the year,

46:37.320 --> 46:40.320
even nicer then winter depressions,

46:40.320 --> 46:43.320
because you only have that in the winter.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.880
Self pity - give yourself the time

46:51.160 --> 46:54.160
to -for once- really be sad

46:55.080 --> 46:57.080
and all alone.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.960
And?

47:22.960 --> 47:24.320
Well?

47:25.880 --> 47:27.280
Sorry!

47:31.320 --> 47:33.120
What does it say?

47:36.880 --> 47:39.680
Obviously not in our language.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.760
What now...

47:49.880 --> 47:52.520
- And?
- Holiday...

47:53.880 --> 47:57.640
But I have an idea.
You will go up there.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.040
There is a beautiful view.

48:00.240 --> 48:03.240
A few steps,
I will be right behind you.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.840
- Okay.
- I will go get us something!

48:05.880 --> 48:08.880
- Okay?
- Right, but...

48:11.880 --> 48:13.320
See you.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.480
Oh man.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.440
Oh God.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.160
Quite a view!

48:39.360 --> 48:40.560
Yes.

48:41.360 --> 48:42.640
Beautiful.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.400
Oh, what is that?

49:04.880 --> 49:06.160
Kebap.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.120
Kebap!

49:11.880 --> 49:13.520
Kebap?!

49:22.880 --> 49:25.200
Yummy.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.240
In Kreuzberg it tastes better, though.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.040
Gerry!

49:38.280 --> 49:40.040
It tastes so good.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.680
Maybe that was too much.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.000
It really wasn't that bad!

50:10.080 --> 50:11.280
Kebap!

50:11.360 --> 50:12.800
Well.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.520
But it's really nice here.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.840
I think it's great
that you just go for it...

50:21.400 --> 50:24.440
...and just drive somewhere.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.840
When I was at our students age...

50:39.120 --> 50:44.200
I always thought that life would be so
wild and exciting and crazy

50:46.320 --> 50:49.040
Everyone had their dreams...

50:51.880 --> 50:53.440
And then...

50:54.880 --> 50:59.160
After school,
everything quickly became so foreseeable.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.880
Finish school, then go study...

51:03.360 --> 51:06.200
Then the job where you go every day.

51:06.440 --> 51:10.000
Just to come home to your
long-term relationship

51:10.880 --> 51:14.800
to plan to have children,
and then move together.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.600
I don't know,
it all seems so perfectly laid out for you.

51:20.880 --> 51:24.680
I have somehow totally forgotten
what I want.

51:28.880 --> 51:32.600
Don't you feel the same sometimes?

51:33.160 --> 51:36.160
No.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.800
But I hate it,
when a plan doesn't work out.

51:45.880 --> 51:48.680
Like these fucking dumplings!

51:49.880 --> 51:51.960
We will make a new plan.

51:52.080 --> 51:54.760
- Which is?
- No idea, we'll see.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.080
Thank you!

52:53.400 --> 52:55.760
See you later!

53:34.160 --> 53:36.040
Good morning!

53:39.080 --> 53:42.080
You are five minutes late.

53:43.880 --> 53:47.880
I am very sorry that I am late,
it happens to everyone.

53:48.280 --> 53:51.280
You are getting your
german test back today.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.160
The results were good, really good.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.320
Mrs. Pfeiffer.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.480
Yes!

54:08.560 --> 54:10.160
- How are you?
- Good.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.680
Yes?

54:11.880 --> 54:17.640
Mrs. Pfeiffer we have the results
of your gastroscopy.

54:18.080 --> 54:21.080
We took tissue samples.

54:22.880 --> 54:27.280
And have found out
that you have a stomach carcinoma.

54:29.880 --> 54:31.960
Do you know what that is?

54:34.880 --> 54:39.600
- I almost fell asleep.
- I did fall asleep!

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
Hello.

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
Hey Terry.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.880
Gerry!

54:54.120 --> 54:56.720
Well, see you tomorrow!

54:56.880 --> 54:58.880
- Bye!
- Bye.

55:09.880 --> 55:14.880
Normally, we should operate
as soon as possible.

55:15.200 --> 55:19.200
But with your age, the cardiac defect,
and the diabetes,

55:19.200 --> 55:23.800
it is absolutely out of the question.
The risks are simply too high.

55:24.160 --> 55:28.000
We will treat you
with chemotherapeutics

55:28.360 --> 55:36.200
to reduce the pain and to insure
your continued life expectancy.

55:58.960 --> 56:02.200
I'm really sorry
for what I did.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.280
That wasn't fair.

56:12.880 --> 56:16.920
I always saw how excited you were,
how you absolutely wanted it.

56:18.200 --> 56:22.280
So I thought, I wanted it too.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.680
But that wasn't true.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.280
I was fooling myself.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.560
I was fooling you.

56:43.920 --> 56:50.280
You are very important to me,
but I do not love you anymore.

57:06.360 --> 57:09.240
I don't want this anymore.

57:12.200 --> 57:19.320
I want to be by myself again
and find out what I really want.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.520
Marco.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.400
I am sorry.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.920
It's alright.

57:54.200 --> 57:56.960
Take care of yourself, ok?

58:13.120 --> 58:15.800
What would you do?

58:23.160 --> 58:26.400
Nobody has asked me that before.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.200
Well...

58:35.880 --> 58:37.400
Can I go home?

58:40.240 --> 58:43.560
Marco and I broke up.

58:52.080 --> 58:53.360
Bummer.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.240
And you?

58:59.160 --> 59:01.880
Do you have the test results?

59:05.600 --> 59:07.120
And?

59:10.880 --> 59:13.160
- I can go home.
- Really?

59:14.000 --> 59:15.720
That's great!

59:17.320 --> 59:19.160
Wonderful.

59:21.880 --> 59:23.880
Let's celebrate.

59:25.880 --> 59:28.640
We could cook something.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.040
This thin, right?

59:56.360 --> 59:59.360
You must have showed me this
when I was five years old.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.640
No, I never gave you such a knife.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.920
Now look!

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.120
Put them all in here.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.080
Come on.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.880
With love and care
and your hands wet.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.800
Don't look at me like that.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.520
Almost there.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.160
Thank you for the invitation.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.960
- Take some red cabbage.
- Oh, right.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.720
- Nice cooking.
- I made this!

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
To good health.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.160
And a long life.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.640
I already know our next trip destination.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.800
Easter holidays.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.520
We are going to Zarautz, Spain.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.880
They have the best tapas
in the world.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.720
- Who?
- Us three!

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.360
We are a party now.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080
A culinary travel party.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.600
We will try every kebap there is.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.680
That will be our
backup plan.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.320
- Cheers.
- Cheers, again!?

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.600
- Come here!
- Yes?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.120
At first I couldn't stand you!

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.880
That filthy car of yours.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.480
Grandma!

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.040
Well, it was very spontaneous.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.600
Aren’t you a cute little fatty.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.360
- Grandma!
- I meant it in a good way.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.760
Is your grandmother also like this?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.880
My grandmother is dead.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.400
- Too bad, huh?
- Sure.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.320
Do you miss your grandmother?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.240
Yes, sometimes I do.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.640
Our relationship wasn't
as good as yours.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.280
Us two, huh?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.560
Call me Lissi.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.600
- Gerry!
- What's that?

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.040
Well, it's short for Gerald.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.080
Sherry, that I can remember.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.360
Sherry, that's better.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.800
If I am allowed
to talk about my life.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.520
I liked Loriot.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.520
He didn't fool the people,

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.240
he just payed attention
to how things really were.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.280
And when Clay was boxing.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:06.160
And Elvis Presley,
when he would shake his hips.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.880
Those three...

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.880
That's all you need.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.360
You can teach that
to your children in school.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.480
That was music!

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.360
I wanted to...

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.240
I wanted to give you this necklace.
For this lovely day.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.760
No, this is your wedding gift
from grandpa.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.480
My darling, come here.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
Grandma!?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.640
There is no need to cry.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.040
I am not crying.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.640
It was really nice.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.000
It is the alcohol.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.760
Oh dear.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.760
Grandma, what’s the matter?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.520
Do you want another sip?

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.040
No, I don't!

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.000
I'm just a little tired.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.440
It was really nice.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.560
That's mine.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.720
Ok, then...

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.760
Bye.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.240
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.280
What do you have there?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920
I...

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.200
I have cancer.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.240
And have about four months.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.600
Your grandfather...

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.400
died of cancer,

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.960
your mother wasted away
from stomach cancer.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.520
You are grown up.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.200
You are a woman now.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.480
You have friends.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.600
Give it to me.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.120
Please, give it to me.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.920
Grandma, we will find a way.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.320
I can't do it and I won't!

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.000
Give it to me.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.960
Are you gonna take care of the cat?

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.200
Promise!?

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.439
I love you so much.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.439
I love you too.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.760
I will be right back! It stays this quiet.
Complete your assignments!

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.360
You are leaving?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.560
I didn't want to make such
a big thing out of it.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.920
Bye.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.520
But it is.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.080
- Where do you want to go?
- We'll see!

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.080
I got the caravan.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.120
Want to come with me?

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.200
Now?

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.120
Come on!

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880
Listen...

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.720
I like all of this.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.080
I know.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.720
You rebel.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.240
I get back up.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.400
Stretch my arms away from me
and wait for the next gust.
