WEBVTT

00:42.668 --> 00:43.793
Buongiorno, Gino.

00:44.211 --> 00:48.214
-Mr. Covington, you're early.
-l'm not in a rush, believe me.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.343
Don?

00:52.428 --> 00:54.846
Jed, Jed Covington from Dancer.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.931
Jed, nice to see you.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.016
Please have a seat. l'm almost finished here.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.937
Believe me, he's impossible to bother.
This is a man who won Jaguar.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.105
What is that?

01:04.606 --> 01:07.900
lt's like an expensive, unreliable Dodge.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.193
What, they didn't go for that?

01:09.278 --> 01:14.115
We tried writing sexy like you did,
but frankly our creative went home early.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.160
Well, we'll see what's left of what we did
after working with them for a month.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.621
And Peter Campbell, is that his name?

01:21.957 --> 01:26.544
Boy, were they impressed with him.
This is a big win for your little agency.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.469
So, you really eat English muffins?

01:34.553 --> 01:36.387
Yes, but they're not English.

01:36.472 --> 01:40.183
Well, to those of us at the 4A's,
everything about you is American.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.726
Your sense of humor, your hard work.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.063
A lot of people join
professional associations

01:46.148 --> 01:50.401
and just use it as an excuse
to drink and hand out business cards.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.904
Well, there has been a bit of that.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.492
There's an unelected position
as head of our fiscal control committee.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.661
We'd be honored to have you run it.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.165
l'm sure there are others more deserving.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.168
Who? Fifteen months
after losing Lucky Strike

02:07.252 --> 02:10.505
to landing a car, you kept that place afloat.

02:10.589 --> 02:15.009
-l suppose the world could see it that way.
-Well, the 4A's could use a little of that.

02:15.844 --> 02:22.683
And there's a little trip to The Greenbrier
for the conference with wives or without.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.812
Well, l suppose, l accept.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.773
But don't expect any miracles.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.858
Great. And don't be so modest.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.614
Thank you, gentlemen.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.032
This shouldn't be longer than an hour.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.328
Scarlett,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.789
you have to make sure
the freelance squatters are relocated

02:44.873 --> 02:45.915
before the partners meeting.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.125
Also?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.294
Also there should be danish.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.297
All partners present?

02:53.382 --> 02:54.549
Aye.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.634
Shall we begin with old business?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.886
Ongoing.

02:59.054 --> 03:03.015
lf l may begin, we've received
a confusing request from Jaguar.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.226
They want to explore the idea
of going with a fee structure

03:05.310 --> 03:06.811
as opposed to straight commission.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.565
-ls there a difference?
-Well, it's a very interesting issue.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.650
ln its most simplistic form,

03:12.734 --> 03:15.236
the money we receive
for work on an account is derived

03:15.320 --> 03:18.865
from the 1 5 % commission
included in our media purchases,

03:18.949 --> 03:20.783
plus the markup on production costs.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.119
But under a fee structure,

03:23.203 --> 03:26.414
the client merely pays
for the work being done,

03:26.498 --> 03:30.001
plus a negotiated one-and-a-half
to 2% profit.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.252
Well, that is interesting.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.255
The client asked for it. That's not good.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.507
What if Dunlop Tires wants to do that?

03:36.592 --> 03:41.137
That's a good hypothetical.
lf they can get it, won't everyone want it?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.221
Whatever it is?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.641
lt's not hypothetical.
Dunlop called last night. They'd like to meet.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.393
Well, why didn't you say something?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.103
l was going to wait for new business.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.563
ls it new business yet?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.565
l don't know.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.567
What are the billings?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.361
A little under a million,
including sporting goods and tubing.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.196
But every Jaguar wears them.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.948
So you know
they've heard good things about us.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.452
lncoming calls, what a welcome sound.
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

04:05.412 --> 04:10.124
Shouldn't we have a vote
on the fee versus commission question?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.834
l already said no.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.963
Or should l leave
so you all can do whatever you want?

04:17.424 --> 04:20.259
l move we tell them we'll look into it,
and then we'll look into it.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.886
l second that.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.138
All in favor?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.309
So, more new business?
Back to ongoing business?

04:29.019 --> 04:31.312
Do we have any birthdays?

04:33.482 --> 04:36.484
ls there a TV there?
Tonight's WiId WiId West.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.070
You guys will miss school
and you're getting to go skiing.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.113
l think the WiId West is very low on that list.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.574
Now put your bowl in the sink
and go get dressed.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.534
Henry will be home in an hour.
l wanna beat the traffic.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.498
Try these. They're the biggest ones.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.460
l don't wanna wear someone else's shoes,
especially ski boots.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.879
You know that they're sweaty.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.255
Oh, my gosh!

04:58.340 --> 04:59.423
Try them on.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.467
Eleanor has smaller feet than me now.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.219
And l'm not going skiing anyway.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.846
You think you're going to sit in the lodge
and read a book? Forget it.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.933
l would have rather gone to school
and come home and found you all gone.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.769
ls this your plan, to ruin our ski trip?

05:11.853 --> 05:14.730
l'm old enough that l can stay alone
while you go laugh your heads off.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.524
Fine! l'll leave you locked in a trunk.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.275
Just let me go to Daddy's.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.694
Do they ever take you on vacation?

05:19.945 --> 05:23.072
Megan and Daddy took me
to Disneyland where it's warm.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.491
You want to spend
the weekend there with her

05:25.575 --> 05:27.034
because she lets you do whatever you want.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.161
She lets me eat whatever l want.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.373
Mrs. Francis on line one.

05:35.002 --> 05:35.960
Hello?

05:36.044 --> 05:39.380
l wanted to know if you would have
any problem with me strangling Sally.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.841
Should we be having
this conversation on the phone?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.093
l'm not joking. She's fresh.

05:44.428 --> 05:48.222
And l'd prefer not
to have her sour puss ruining our trip!

05:49.349 --> 05:51.267
Well, if you think killing her
is the only way out of that...

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
We're dropping her off.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.730
-Mr. Cooper here to see you.
-Send him in.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.023
l'm gonna be busy all weekend.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.316
lt's your child bride
she wants to spend time with.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.527
Are you still asking for a favor?

06:01.611 --> 06:02.695
l'm not asking.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.488
We're dropping her off in an hour.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.074
She can sleep
with the doorman for all l care.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.874
l have a question l don't know
how to phrase other than as an accusation.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.042
What?

06:16.126 --> 06:19.420
l took it upon myself
to evaluate the fee issue.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.965
And upon examination of our books,
l found this canceled check

06:24.384 --> 06:26.010
in an unopened statement.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.723
l'd ask you if you knew about it,

06:30.807 --> 06:32.558
but your signature's on the check.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.853
So it is.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.481
l thought we agreed to forego bonuses.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.691
-We did.
-And yet you gave him one.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.070
Bert, l'll take care of it.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.031
You know, you can't keep being
the good little boy

06:47.115 --> 06:49.492
while the adults run this business.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.628
Dawn, could you get Mr. Pryce in here?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.438
You wanted to see me?

07:19.648 --> 07:20.648
Close the door.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.864
Did you hear about the 4A's?

07:29.241 --> 07:32.535
l hope it's all right.
l accepted on behalf of the firm.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.411
What the hell is this?

07:37.582 --> 07:38.874
This.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.918
l remember.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.002
l didn't sign it.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.798
Of course you did. Right there.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.341
You want me to play detective?

07:47.551 --> 07:50.094
Don, we all sign a lot of things.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.262
ls this the only one?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.598
l won't sit here and bear this interrogation.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.975
You want a professional to do it?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.025
l'm giving you a chance to come clean.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.986
ls this the only one?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.374
How did you get this?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.630
Cooper opened the latest bank statement
and the books.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.639
lt was a 1 3-day loan.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.225
But then we canceled the bonuses.

08:38.602 --> 08:42.104
You delayed them
and then you canceled them.

08:43.064 --> 08:47.359
Then you wanted the money for Joan.
And l'm the one who's committed the crime?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.278
-Are you gambling?
-No.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.573
l owed taxes on my portfolio,

08:52.657 --> 08:57.494
which l liquidated to put $50,000
into this firm after we lost Lucky Strike.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.496
lf you needed it so badly,
why didn't you ask?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.917
Why suffer the humiliation
for a 1 3-day loan?

09:04.419 --> 09:06.045
That was my money!

09:11.551 --> 09:12.927
l'm gonna need your resignation.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.306
Just a moment.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.268
l'm sorry and l am remorseful.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.774
l don't know how it came to this,
but the company's in shipshape.

09:27.275 --> 09:32.988
And l will make good by Easter,
even if l have to pull my son out of school.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.867
You embezzled funds
and you forged my signature.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.080
l apologize deeply for involving you.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.460
l suppose l picked you because
you've always been the most decent to me.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.297
l'm doing the most decent thing
l could possibly do, Lane.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.174
l'm letting you resign.

09:54.135 --> 09:58.597
l have never been compensated
for my contributions to this company,

09:58.682 --> 10:01.433
including my role in its very existence.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.563
Who would ever have dreamt
of the word "Jaguar"?

10:09.651 --> 10:13.445
l took away nothing from P.P.L.,
while you lined your pockets.

10:13.530 --> 10:17.074
And l have operated on a loss
for three years!

10:18.660 --> 10:20.327
Please reconsider.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.083
l'm sorry.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.794
l can't trust you.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.464
l'll cover the money that you owe.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.219
Because 7,500 is nothing to you.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.931
Do you know how the rest of us live?

10:42.267 --> 10:44.435
And in the end, who's been harmed, really?

10:44.519 --> 10:46.937
Can you imagine what would happen
if a client found out?

10:48.356 --> 10:49.857
l'll lose my visa.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.528
l can't go back to England, not like this.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.032
What would l tell my wife?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.201
What would l tell my son?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.999
You'll tell them that it didn't work out,
because it didn't.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.045
And you'll tell them
the next thing will be better,

11:11.629 --> 11:12.755
because it always is.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.012
Take the weekend.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.598
Think of an elegant exit.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.725
Cooper doesn't know anything.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.170
l feel a bit light-headed.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.255
That's relief.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.260
l've started over a lot, Lane.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.264
This is the worst part.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.711
Were you celebrating with Don?

12:35.547 --> 12:36.588
Celebrating?

12:36.714 --> 12:40.008
Scarlett told me about
your 4A's chairmanship. Congratulations.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.636
You look busy.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.806
l'm thinking about
taking a vacation this Easter.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.102
Where are we going?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.230
Do you think there is a difference
between Bermuda and Hawaii?

12:53.481 --> 12:57.609
Well, neither is suitable for commemorating
the death and resurrection of our Lord.

12:59.529 --> 13:03.240
Can you imagine me locked in a hotel room
with a baby and my mother?

13:03.658 --> 13:05.659
l suppose you'd rather l imagined you

13:05.743 --> 13:08.787
bouncing in the sand
in some obscene bikini.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.292
l think you should
take your party elsewhere.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.796
Well, bon voyage.

14:04.469 --> 14:08.013
l had to get up very early this morning
to go to work,

14:08.097 --> 14:11.350
to make more money,
buy you more champagne.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.647
Go back to bed.

14:19.526 --> 14:24.029
She's a 25-year-old coat check girl
from Long lsland or Rhode lsland.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.908
She'd never had room service before.
lt's too easy.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.118
Why do we do this?

14:30.578 --> 14:33.330
For the sex, but it's always disappointing.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.040
For me, anyway.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.917
l don't like what we're doing.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.585
So you're drinking with a purpose.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.921
l'm tired of this piddly shit.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.508
l'm tired of living in this delusion
that we're going somewhere

14:44.592 --> 14:46.426
when we can't even give
Christmas bonuses.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.805
What about your speech
about how we were arriving and so forth?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.432
Or we've arrived?
l don't remember, but it was good.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.892
So you feel different since Jaguar?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.894
-We're getting incoming calls.
-Pete is.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.854
Look, l don't like him,
but he's kind of turned things around.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.064
He still thinks small.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.943
Dunlop's another Topaz.
lt's another Mohawk.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.319
lt's another coat check girl.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.946
-So you don't want it?
-No.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.448
l don't want Jaguar, l want Chevy.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.202
l don't want Mohawk, l want American.
l don't want Dunlop, l want Firestone.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.913
Don't yell at me. l'd love to have Firestone.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.707
l spent the night
at the American Cancer Society

15:16.791 --> 15:18.208
with my hand in Jim Barton's pocket

15:18.293 --> 15:20.210
and you told me l was wasting my time.
You told me he was dead.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.379
Because Ed Baxter told me
the Lucky Strike letter

15:22.463 --> 15:23.922
poisoned us with all those companies.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.924
What? Why didn't you tell me that?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.136
Because l wrote that letter.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.431
You let that wax figurine discourage you?

15:33.516 --> 15:35.934
Why didn't you just ask me?
l'll get you a meeting with Firestone.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.604
-lt doesn't mean it's not true.
-Jesus, Don.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.565
You used to love "no."
"No" used to make you hard.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.859
And whether you admit it or not,
things have changed.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.154
You just beat out two huge firms
for that shitty car account.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.575
Caroline, get me James Barton
at Firestone Tires.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
No, get Ed Baxter.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.748
Let that go.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.627
What's Dow Chemical bill? 20 million?
lt's about the same size as Lucky Strike.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.213
l'm telling you, Ed Baxter is Moby Dick.
There are easier whales.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.633
So you can't get me a meeting.
They're three buildings away.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.925
Look, l'm sure he'll meet with you.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.554
Even if it's just to watch you eat shit,
but it's complicated.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.097
What about Kenny?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.725
ln case you've forgotten, he's squeamish
about working with his family.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.894
Then fire him.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.823
Hi!

16:31.908 --> 16:33.408
What are you doing here?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.619
My dad didn't even tell you, did he?

16:35.703 --> 16:39.665
l'm spending the weekend here
because l didn't wanna go skiing.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.626
l thought you'd be excited.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.545
l just didn't know.
What's wrong with skiing?

16:45.630 --> 16:48.632
l hate her so much. She's such a phony.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.884
You know that's not true.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.594
Can we have tea?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.224
Go ahead and put the water out.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.189
Sorry l'm late.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.359
l don't mind waiting 20 minutes
for an unspecified meeting with my boss.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.028
l mean, it's not like
your imagination would run wild.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.075
So we're going after your father-in-law.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.953
l see.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.579
Well, l've told you before,
l can't help with that.

17:19.664 --> 17:20.747
That's what l'm counting on.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.874
What the hell does that mean?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.419
We want the business
and it has nothing to do with you.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.503
And we'd like to keep it that way,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.089
since you'd prefer not to jeopardize
your relationship with your wife.

17:30.925 --> 17:35.220
So what do you think's gonna happen
when Ed calls me the minute you call him?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.764
l don't know.

17:39.684 --> 17:44.187
l suppose you could not answer the phone.
You might be having a drink with your boss.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.191
That's very smart.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.612
l guess there's nothing
l can do to muck it up now.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.614
What the hell does that mean?

17:56.117 --> 18:00.036
Well, l'd hate to bring it up with Cynthia,
even by accident.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.832
Look at you.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.085
What would it take for you to do nothing?

18:07.170 --> 18:09.963
Some kind of partnership,
assuming it works out?

18:10.298 --> 18:13.592
No, l don't want to be your partner.
l've seen what's involved.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.641
All l need is a promise
that if you get it, you'll force me on it.

18:22.852 --> 18:23.977
Okay.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.229
You really fought us.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.148
And two other things.

18:29.484 --> 18:33.278
Pete doesn't go to the meeting
and Pete doesn't go to any meetings.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.994
As you were.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.717
Where are you coming from?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.511
Hemisphere Club.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.015
l've got good news. l talked to Ed.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.476
-What did he say?
-That he'll see you Monday morning.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.812
Monday? Are you kidding me?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.608
You said to get you a meeting.
l got you a meeting.

19:13.194 --> 19:16.571
You think this is a serious meeting,
giving me 48 hours to prepare?

19:16.697 --> 19:17.864
l think that's up to you.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.870
Don't lose your nerve.
l like that guy l saw today. l missed him.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.383
When did you get here?

19:36.467 --> 19:39.219
After lunch.
They couldn't wait to get rid of me.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.430
-Where's Megan?
-Taking a nap.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.146
l love when you surprise me.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.439
l forgot about it.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.025
Well, don't forget Betty's not coming home
until Monday afternoon,

19:54.110 --> 19:55.902
so you can drive her out to school
Monday morning.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.988
l have a meeting. You'll have to do it.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.532
l have an audition.
l'm gonna be gone all morning.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.828
Sally, you'll be here alone Monday morning.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.288
Megan's got plans until lunch.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.039
-l have school.
-Not anymore.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.708
Turn off the damn TV.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.587
Anything else?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.839
You don't even call me?

20:15.923 --> 20:17.173
Do you know how insulting it is,

20:17.258 --> 20:19.426
the assumption
that l have nothing else to do?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.511
l had to fire Lane today.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.430
What?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.099
What happened?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.522
He stole money from the company.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.941
He seems so honest.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.068
Why would he do that?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.653
What's the difference?

20:39.405 --> 20:42.115
lt's all just gossip at a certain point.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.241
You can't tell anyone.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.662
ls the firm okay?

20:48.205 --> 20:49.706
We'll be fine.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.876
Did you eat orjust drink?

20:53.461 --> 20:54.586
l'm not hungry.

20:55.171 --> 20:58.173
Well, you're gonna have dinner
with your daughter.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.634
-l have a lot of work to do.
-So do l.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.177
After dinner.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.309
What are you doing there?

21:09.393 --> 21:10.769
We're going to dinner.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.395
No, dear.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.398
We're going to celebrate. More, obviously.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.150
No, damn it.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.569
What's gotten into you?

21:20.321 --> 21:22.405
l've had a dreadful day, dear.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.158
Not all of it.

21:25.242 --> 21:29.496
l'm tired of you refusing
to recognize the successes when they come.

21:29.580 --> 21:34.501
l know your work is unpleasant sometimes,
but l'm very proud of you.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.379
You're very kind.

21:37.672 --> 21:41.091
You obviously had a good day
that turned into a bad day

21:41.175 --> 21:42.801
and you drank too much.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.429
But you came home to me on time.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.932
Now you're taking me to dinner.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.475
No arguments.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.692
Can't we just take a cab?

22:03.072 --> 22:05.031
l thought racing green.

22:18.212 --> 22:21.006
-How did you get this?
-l wrote a check.

22:21.757 --> 22:25.051
l hope you're not cross. You know what?
l don't care if you are.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.886
You never spend on yourself.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.515
lt's always about my travel
or Nigel's schooling.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.810
And l told the salesman you were a partner
at the car's advertising agency

22:33.894 --> 22:36.354
and he gave me a very fair price.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.442
Come, let's take a little drive.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.236
lt's lovely.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.697
Go on, sit in it.

22:50.161 --> 22:53.163
Oh, dear. You really did overdo it.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.753
Okay, found it.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.338
You sure you don't wanna come?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.175
He wants to work. Look at him.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.053
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.
He'll be miserable.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.559
You girls have fun.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.362
lt's cleared up.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.783
You could just go round the block
if you're still not feeling steady.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.493
l've work to do.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.369
l don't understand you.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.790
Are you really going
to spend your whole weekend working?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.125
Don't you like your present?

23:39.210 --> 23:44.714
l love the car and l love you so much,
but l don't feel right driving it

23:44.799 --> 23:48.468
until l've taken care of
some of these errands l've let go.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.304
There'll be plenty of time, dear.

23:53.224 --> 23:57.393
You got sick from drink again yesterday.
Why do you continue?

23:57.478 --> 23:59.979
lt's cognac. lt settles the stomach.

24:01.524 --> 24:04.651
Well, finish up and then we'll go for a drive.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.656
l don't think there's really anything to see.

24:09.740 --> 24:13.201
l was telling Sally about my plan
to ensnare David.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.578
Either way, Carter's gonna wanna
rehearse with you alone.

24:15.663 --> 24:16.704
Can l get some coffee?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.373
l'll have some, too.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.999
He's not gonna bring you coffee.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.878
Georgy Girl,

24:24.672 --> 24:26.756
Alfie, Gambit,

24:26.841 --> 24:29.759
Night of the Generals, Blow-up?

24:29.844 --> 24:32.011
Anything without abortions
or foreigners in it?

24:32.763 --> 24:34.848
Let's see. Fistful of Dollars.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.851
l think your father would kill me
if l see that without him.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.979
So, l don't understand.
Do you like David or Carter?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.232
Well, Carter likes me.
Do you know what he said to me?

24:44.859 --> 24:48.361
l can't believe l didn't tell you this.
He asked if l was a redhead everywhere.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.029
Stop! Okay?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.991
No, it's okay. l have a boyfriend.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.618
-Since when?
-A while.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.787
But l don't know if he likes me that way.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.414
Then he's not a boyfriend.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.042
A lot of great romances
start out as friendships.

25:04.461 --> 25:08.882
A boyfriend's a person
that makes you feel special.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.552
A person that knows you.
And holding hands is plenty.

25:18.392 --> 25:22.020
-You should see if you can get a drink.
-l don't want a drink.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.791
-Are you using the lodge phone?
-No.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.169
l told Betty and Henry
to take their ski vacation and shove it.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.506
-Are you stuck with Bluto again?
-No, l'm at Megan's.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.008
That's better, l bet.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.928
Actually, l'm gonna be
all alone tomorrow morning.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.179
Wanna come visit me?

27:20.389 --> 27:21.431
Really?

27:21.515 --> 27:22.640
You can take the train.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.100
lt's not that easy.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.728
l've gotta sneak off campus,
which is serious.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.189
Plus, it's a 20-minute bike ride to the station
and then two hours on the train.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.816
Forget it.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.444
For a year you've been saying
how much you wanted to visit me.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.195
Are we ever gonna see each other?

27:37.781 --> 27:38.906
All right.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.617
The earliest l can get
to Grand Central is 8:30.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.620
l'm gonna have to work on my paper tonight
to get it typed tomorrow.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.457
783 Park, apartment 1 7B.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.375
l gotta get a pen.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.824
Do your homework, don't use the juicer,
and l'll be home around 1 :00.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.576
The first thing l'm gonna do is feel that TV.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.079
-Break a leg.
-Thanks.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.009
You gonna tell me
what you're gonna talk about

28:40.094 --> 28:42.845
or is my look of surprise
part of the sales pitch?

28:42.930 --> 28:44.263
l don't want it to sound rehearsed.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.141
No danger of that.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.687
Just go in there and keep your cool.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.607
But if he baits you,
l want you to punch him in the balls.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.153
-What happened to your enlightenment?
-l don't know.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.532
lt wore off.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.118
Just a minute.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.131
Hey.

29:18.799 --> 29:19.799
Come in.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.219
You didn't check the peephole.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.306
l knew it was you, silly.
The doorman sent you up.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.310
-You don't look that different.
-Well, you do.

29:34.898 --> 29:35.982
What do you think?

29:37.985 --> 29:40.653
There's a kid at school
whose parents have one better than this.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.488
lt has a second floor.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.701
-What do you wanna do?
-Are you kidding?

29:46.869 --> 29:48.744
The museum's right across the park.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.539
We don't go across the park.
There's bums on the other side.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.458
l've got money for a cab.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.710
Okay. Let me get my jacket.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.386
How'd they get all these animals?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.972
Teddy Roosevelt killed them.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.683
Do you think they were a family?

30:10.767 --> 30:12.852
l hope so. Otherwise, what were they doing?

30:13.145 --> 30:16.606
Walking around saying,
"We just need a baby to finish this diorama."

30:20.360 --> 30:22.987
There's this kid, Anderson, he's a senior.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.948
He keeps picking fights with me
and he's twice my size.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.200
What a jerk.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.288
All the senior lacrosse guys
peed in my locker.

30:32.372 --> 30:35.208
They ruined my jersey.
They're a bunch of sadists.

30:35.876 --> 30:39.378
Henry got picked on when he was little,
and now he runs a city.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.797
That's true.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.804
l keep wishing he would leave her.
l know it's wrong. l feel really bad.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.599
Don't. You can't make it happen.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.313
Just so you know,
l could get in trouble, too,

30:57.397 --> 30:58.940
but l really wanted to see you.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.025
Yeah, l can't believe l almost didn't come.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.237
My stomach hurts.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.906
Maybe you're hungry. Want some caribou?

31:10.994 --> 31:12.203
Listen,

31:12.996 --> 31:14.705
l feel kind of bad.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.043
They were teasing me
and l might have told them

31:19.127 --> 31:22.255
that l was coming to the city
to do it with you.

31:24.758 --> 31:25.758
Really?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.010
Yeah.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.055
They don't know how old you are.
l hope that's okay.

31:33.934 --> 31:37.687
You can say whatever you want, but l...

31:37.771 --> 31:40.064
l'm not sure that's the way l like you.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.857
Yeah, good.

31:43.235 --> 31:47.113
Yeah. l always think that you're
like my little sister, except smart.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.157
You have a mustache.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.911
l usually shave on Sunday night.
l didn't think you'd care.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.454
l don't like it.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.378
l really don't feel well. l'll be right back.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.630
Okay. Meet me in Africa.

32:23.150 --> 32:26.152
Mr. Baxter will see you now.
You can leave your coats.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.323
An hour and 45 minutes.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.992
Better than l thought.

32:37.706 --> 32:41.292
This is Tom Schafer, director of marketing.
Jack Schmidt, head of household.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.419
-Roger Sterling.
-Don Draper.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.263
Ed, you said they were gonna
bring your son-in-law.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.182
Ken knows better.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.559
So, Don, what's so urgent?

32:58.727 --> 33:00.853
l didn't say urgent. l said imminent.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.605
Well, Ed, l wanna talk about your business.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.190
What about it?

33:04.358 --> 33:06.192
See, l've been looking at what you're doing

33:06.276 --> 33:07.943
and l think you're in
desperate need of change.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.196
-And you're just the guy to do it.
-l am.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.366
Are you still the guy who wrote that letter?

33:13.450 --> 33:14.909
l don't wanna hear about that letter again.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.827
Do you know how hard we fought
to save that account?

33:16.912 --> 33:18.788
And they stabbed us first, believe me.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.998
And nobody's gonna wanna be
in the cigarette business.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.333
The government's in the process
of killing it.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.793
So you're vindictive?

33:23.877 --> 33:26.295
Not as vindictive as you, apparently.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.214
l had a feeling
this is what this was all about.

33:28.382 --> 33:30.758
lt's not. This is about your business.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.260
Well, we appreciate that,
but we're very happy with MacManus.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.679
l'm sure they're very happy with you.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.514
But you don't owe them anything.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.474
All they have to do
is keep running the same work.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.226
You're on the back burner over there,

33:40.310 --> 33:42.978
subsidizing all the great creative work
they're doing

33:43.063 --> 33:45.231
and paying for new business lunches.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.775
As soon as you walk away,
that place will fold up like a tent.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.778
We're at 50 % market share
in almost everything we make.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.532
Because you have a big line
of diverse and charismatic products.

33:54.616 --> 33:58.327
And you keep making more,
Ziptape, Styrofoam, Rovana.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.162
And why do you do that?

34:00.247 --> 34:03.833
Because even though success is a reality,
its effects are temporary.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.251
You get hungry,
even though you've just eaten.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.422
At the old firm,
we had London Fog raincoats.

34:09.506 --> 34:13.342
We had a year where we sold 81 %
of the raincoats in the United States.

34:13.427 --> 34:14.468
Name another raincoat.

34:14.553 --> 34:18.222
But we didn't stop working for them
because 81 % isn't enough.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.099
Tell me about napalm.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.727
You mean that stuff those kids
outside your building are screaming about?

34:24.020 --> 34:26.188
Napalm was invented in 1 942.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.983
The government put
it in flamethrowers against the Nazis,

34:29.067 --> 34:30.568
impact bombs against the Japanese.

34:30.652 --> 34:34.321
lt was all over Korea. l was there.
And now it's in Vietnam.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.783
But the important thing is
when our boys are fighting and they need it,

34:37.868 --> 34:40.995
when America needs it,
Dow makes it and it works.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.625
But it doesn't change the fact
that we're happy with our agency.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.128
Are you? You're happy with 50%?

34:49.212 --> 34:50.838
You're on top and you don't have enough.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.424
You're happy
because you're successful for now.

34:53.508 --> 34:54.717
But what is happiness?

34:54.801 --> 34:56.886
lt's a moment
before you need more happiness.

34:56.970 --> 34:59.555
l won't settle for 50% of anything.
l want 1 00 %.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.433
You're happy with your agency?
You're not happy with anything.

35:02.517 --> 35:07.271
You don't want most of it. You want all of it.
And l won't stop until you get all of it.

35:09.691 --> 35:10.733
Thank you for your time.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.320
Thank you for stopping by.

35:21.328 --> 35:24.830
l'll buy you a drink
if you wipe the blood off your mouth.

35:30.837 --> 35:37.676
Sally?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.389
Sally!

35:43.558 --> 35:44.600
What's going on?

35:44.684 --> 35:47.394
She just pulled up in a cab with a $25 fare.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.521
l got it.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.858
Sally? Let me in.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.568
ls Henry out there?

35:54.861 --> 35:57.029
No. Let me in.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.704
l got my... My period started
and l didn't know what to do.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.918
l just wanted to come home.

36:13.046 --> 36:15.464
lt's okay. We'll take care of it.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.928
lt's okay, sweetheart.

36:23.974 --> 36:25.349
lt's okay.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.772
l'm sorry to bother you,
but can l leave these here?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.232
Why?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.568
Mr. Pryce hasn't come in yet
and his door is locked,

36:35.652 --> 36:38.112
and l don't feel comfortable
with the company's records

36:38.196 --> 36:39.613
parked on the edge of my desk.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.156
Just leave them.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.995
Please tell him
to call me the minute he gets back.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.580
Thank you, Dawn.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.715
-Can l help you?
-ls Sally here?

36:57.799 --> 36:59.884
She's not. Who are you?

37:00.385 --> 37:02.928
l'm Glen. l left my bag here.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.346
Do you know where she is?

37:04.431 --> 37:05.973
No. l just asked you.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.766
What is going on? What are you doing here?

37:07.851 --> 37:09.351
l don't know, okay?

37:09.436 --> 37:11.687
We went to the museum
and she said she wasn't feeling well,

37:11.771 --> 37:12.938
and then she just took off.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.774
l looked for her and finally just thought,
maybe she came back here.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.276
l just need my bag, okay?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.986
Calm down.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.077
-When was this?
-l don't know.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.997
l was at the museum for a long time.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.916
l really looked for her.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.960
l didn't do anything. l just want my bag.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.755
l would have left it,
but l've got a book on Nat Turner in there

37:37.839 --> 37:39.048
and my paper's due tomorrow.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.884
Don't move.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.889
-Hello?
-Yes, Megan.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.892
l was just calling to say
if you or Don were wondering where Sally is,

37:49.976 --> 37:51.018
she found her way home.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.103
Thank God.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.189
l just found out or l would have called.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.567
What happened?

37:58.985 --> 38:00.277
Well...

38:01.112 --> 38:04.031
She became a woman today. She started.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.995
l think she just needed her mother.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.666
No, of course.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.251
Well, let her know that l'm glad she's okay.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.544
l will.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.424
What happened?

38:23.009 --> 38:24.593
She wasn't feeling well.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.512
-Was that Betty?
-Yes.

38:31.685 --> 38:32.935
Where are you going?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.104
To Grand Central
to get the train back to school.

38:35.188 --> 38:38.065
l've already lost one kid today.
l'll put you on the train.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.568
Well, it doesn't leave until 7:00.

38:43.738 --> 38:49.660
Look, just wait here, finish your paper.
l'll take you later.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.290
Do you want something to eat?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.042
lf you don't mind.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.902
What's going on?

39:24.529 --> 39:27.740
l think something's
terribly wrong in Mr. Pryce's office.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.241
l can't get the door open.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.753
Dear Lord.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.101
Jesus.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.980
Here.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.026
Are you feeling better?

40:04.110 --> 40:06.445
-l'm so embarrassed.
-Don't be.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.532
And if you ever get in trouble like that again,
just ask another woman.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.950
They'll understand.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.411
Oh, gosh, l don't wanna talk about it.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.622
Move over. l wanna lie down.

40:24.089 --> 40:28.467
There's a lot of responsibilities,
but that's what being a woman is.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.470
And when it happens every month,

40:31.679 --> 40:33.305
even though it's unpleasant,

40:33.556 --> 40:35.557
it means everything's working.

40:35.642 --> 40:40.312
lt means everything's ready for a baby
when you want one.

40:41.815 --> 40:46.151
And maybe you'll have a beautiful girl
and you can tell her all this.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.500
Well, l'll tell you one thing,
if they haven't called the agency,

41:01.584 --> 41:03.168
they probably called the men in white coats.

41:03.753 --> 41:04.795
Hello?

41:15.932 --> 41:17.558
l think you should sit down.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.101
What's going on?

41:19.310 --> 41:22.104
Lane hanged himself in his office.

41:22.730 --> 41:23.856
What?

41:32.365 --> 41:34.283
Cooper sent everybody home.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.161
Told them there was a building emergency.
Nobody knows.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.456
What the hell happened?

41:41.541 --> 41:43.041
Who knows?

41:43.543 --> 41:45.544
Come on, l'm taking you home.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.046
No, l wanna wait.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.548
For what?

41:49.674 --> 41:52.384
We're waiting for the coroner
to cut him down and take him away.

41:54.470 --> 41:58.140
What, he's still in there?
We can't leave him like that.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.482
They said not to disturb the body.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.401
-lt's a crime scene.
-Come on.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.737
We can't leave him like that.

42:27.921 --> 42:29.963
Get something to cut him down.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.514
Here, cut.

42:44.771 --> 42:45.896
Jesus.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.295
Come on.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.348
Let's go.

43:31.985 --> 43:33.902
"To my fellow partners."

43:34.988 --> 43:36.280
Open it.

43:46.207 --> 43:47.624
lt's a resignation letter.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.170
lt's boilerplate.

44:15.945 --> 44:17.112
What are you doing home?

44:21.034 --> 44:22.200
Hello, Mr. Draper.

44:22.869 --> 44:23.827
Who are you?

44:23.911 --> 44:27.456
This is Glen. He's Sally's friend.
He's waiting for his train.

44:27.790 --> 44:28.832
Where's Sally?

44:29.042 --> 44:31.376
She went home. l'll explain later.

44:33.046 --> 44:34.963
l don't understand. l gotta lie down.

44:35.048 --> 44:36.423
We've met before.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.009
l used to live down the street in Ossining.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.635
You know my mother, Helen Bishop?

44:41.220 --> 44:43.263
Oh, right.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.265
l should just go.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.392
And sit in Grand Central until 7:00?

44:47.560 --> 44:48.894
l'll be fine.

44:48.978 --> 44:50.062
Where are you headed?

44:50.605 --> 44:53.523
l go to Hotchkiss. lt's up in Lakeville.
lt's a couple of hours away.

44:54.150 --> 44:56.068
That's fine. Let's go.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.444
Are you sure?

44:57.862 --> 44:59.071
Yes.

45:02.283 --> 45:03.492
Are you okay?

45:03.868 --> 45:06.036
l had a bad day. We can talk about it later.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.998
Thank you very much
for your hospitality, Megan.

45:10.083 --> 45:12.084
lt was very nice to meet you.

45:26.432 --> 45:28.642
Why does everything turn out crappy?

45:29.310 --> 45:30.477
What do you mean?

45:32.772 --> 45:34.231
l don't know.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.691
Everything you wanna do,

45:37.360 --> 45:41.488
everything you think is gonna
make you happy just turns to crap.

45:42.198 --> 45:44.032
You're too young to talk that way.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.784
But it's true.

45:53.751 --> 45:54.876
What do you wanna do?

45:56.838 --> 46:00.799
lf you could do anything,
what would you do?
