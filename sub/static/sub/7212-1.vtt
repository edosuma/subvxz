00:57.916 --> 00:59.375
Come on.

01:35.666 --> 01:37.500
Vincent.

01:38.541 --> 01:40.750
No, no. Bad idea.
Bad idea.

02:11.041 --> 02:12.666
"Do not feed bears"

03:00.041 --> 03:02.125
Just take what you need.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.666
Just take what you need.

03:55.916 --> 04:00.541
RJ?
No.

04:00.541 --> 04:04.791
The moon's not full.
You woke me up a week early?

04:09.416 --> 04:15.625
Don't tell me you're actually 
dumb enough to 
steal my stuff.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.750
RJ I'm gonna have to kill you.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.791
Please, I'm just a desperate guy 
trying to feed his family.

04:21.791 --> 04:25.291
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

04:25.666 --> 04:30.291
Ok, wait, wait ,wait.
Look, it's still in 
the cave so technically not stolen.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.666
Oh, no.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.541
Slope!

04:43.041 --> 04:44.000
Stop.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.541
Phew! That was close.

04:56.541 --> 04:58.166
Vincent wait,
I can get it all back!

04:59.875 --> 05:02.541
That's right, if you eat me
you'd have to do it.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.791
But I can get it.
All of it!

05:04.791 --> 05:06.791
- A red wagon?
- Redder!

05:07.791 --> 05:11.041
- The blue cooler?
- Cooler, on my list.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.416
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes, and I want my Spuddies.

05:14.500 --> 05:19.916
I love those things.
Cos when you eat Spuddies 
enough just isn't enough.

05:19.916 --> 05:25.125
So true, painfully true. 
And I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna get the 
giant picnic pack family fun-size.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.291
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

05:29.291 --> 05:35.125
Alright RJ, I'm going back to sleep.
When that moon is full I'm waking up.

05:35.416 --> 05:40.291
And all my stuff had better 
be right back where it was.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.666
But that's just one week.
That's impossible for one guy...

05:43.791 --> 05:45.791
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

05:45.916 --> 05:48.291
Full moon.
All my stuff.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.541
and don't even think about running away

05:50.541 --> 05:55.125
because if you do, 
I will hunt you down.
And kill you.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.166
Ok, buddy.
You just rest easy 
all right cos I'm on it.

06:02.416 --> 06:06.291
A week from now
you're gonna be laughing about this thing.

06:36.416 --> 06:39.791
"Over The Hedge"™

07:42.875 --> 07:46.291
Ahhh cold!
The one place i 
didn't have a shell.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.000
Spring.

08:08.291 --> 08:11.041
That means there's only 
274 days left till winter!

08:11.291 --> 08:14.000
Everybody wake up!
Hibernation's over!

08:14.250 --> 08:16.166
Morning!
- Morning Hammy.

08:16.416 --> 08:17.416
I gotta go wee-wee.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.916
Oh! Not in the lake we drink from!

08:20.291 --> 08:22.916
Let's go alright the rest of you, 
it's spring!

08:23.250 --> 08:25.041
That means we got to get to work.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.416
Ahh, finish.
Ohh! No, wait!

08:28.541 --> 08:31.166
Come on everybody wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

08:31.666 --> 08:34.875
Y'all better listen.
I've been holding 
something in all winter.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.625
and I'm about to let it out.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.166
Thank you, Stella.
- Oh I can clear a room, Verne.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.916
That much I can do.

08:46.041 --> 08:50.375
Goodmorning everyone.
Just a superduper morning eh.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.250
Woah, not looking so good
around the eyes there, hon.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.541
Bucky and Grill were 
up every 3 or 4 weeks.

08:57.541 --> 08:59.416
and Spikey kept poking me.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.291
Well, he's kinda poky.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.166
Yup, he's the sharpest of the bunch.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.625
You know what?
How about i take the day shift.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.666
Oh Lou, that'd be just super.

09:07.666 --> 09:10.541
Alright kids, you heard your mother
and now you listen to me.

09:10.875 --> 09:11.791
Shape up there!

09:14.875 --> 09:16.666
This is what I was afraid of.

09:17.375 --> 09:20.291
Where's the food? Is there any food left?
I'm really hungry! 
So is there any food left in here?!

09:20.541 --> 09:22.791
We ate all the food 
Hammy,
during the winter.

09:22.791 --> 09:24.666
So, we gotta go and get somemore now.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.791
I hid some nuts in the woods and I 
know where they are now so I'll be right back. 
Bye!

09:35.875 --> 09:36.916
Dad, it was just snow.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.250
What? It could have been a predator.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.666
Isn't playing dead a little...weak?

09:41.541 --> 09:43.916
Heather, how many times must i say it?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.791
Playing possum is what we do.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.041
We die,
so that we live!

09:49.125 --> 09:52.000
Kids, ok
so just calm down!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.041
This is a week to find you a you 
know,
a good fella.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.625
A good fella?

09:58.791 --> 10:00.916
Why does everyone think
I need a man, huh?

10:00.916 --> 10:03.250
I look like a mess
and smell like a swamp.

10:03.375 --> 10:09.000
So when you find a fella who is decent,
good with kids and has no sense of smell, call me.

10:21.625 --> 10:22.916
Oh look, food!

10:23.166 --> 10:26.541
Well i think you know,
what this means.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.500
Verne?
- Just a minute, Hammy.

10:29.416 --> 10:33.041
This means we are nine berries
away from starvation.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.291
Sorry, that was a little intense.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.875
I meant really serious hunger pains.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.166
Verne!
- Not finished, Hammy.

10:41.166 --> 10:44.541
Mornin' Lou, Penny. 
-Thanks.
Hey kids.

10:45.416 --> 10:46.750
So, what i want to tell you all is...

10:46.791 --> 10:49.250
I'm not done, Hammy!
If you have to go again, just go!

10:50.541 --> 10:52.625
Ok, so all I'm saying is that
we got a little close.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.375
So this year we got to make sure 
we fill the log...
- all the way to the top.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.416
Exactly!
All the way to the top!

10:59.416 --> 11:01.666
Because, what are we?
- Foragers!

11:02.041 --> 11:04.291
And what do we forage?
- Food!

11:06.166 --> 11:08.166
Super Verne, really super.
- Ok, Hammy.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.416
What is it?
- What is what?

11:10.625 --> 11:12.125
What is it you wanted to tell me?

11:13.666 --> 11:15.666
Ohh..What was it, what was it, what was it?!

11:16.916 --> 11:18.291
Right at the tip of my tongue!

11:18.291 --> 11:20.875
Oh yeah, there's a weird thing over there!
I've never seen before!

11:20.916 --> 11:22.291
It's really scary!
Follow me!

11:25.541 --> 11:28.541
Ok, meeting called on account of weird, 
scary thing.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.416
Hmm, Foragers.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.625
Hammy, what weird thing?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.666
Oh, that weird thing.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.666
It never ends!

12:17.166 --> 12:19.500
It never ends that way too.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.000
What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

12:33.916 --> 12:36.291
I'm scared.
- Me too, mommy.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.375
It's ok, It's just a...
What is this thing Lou?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.416
Well, it's a... Verne?

12:42.916 --> 12:46.916
Well, it's obviously
some kind of bush.

12:47.041 --> 12:50.000
I would be a lot less afraid of it
if I just know what's it called.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Let's call it Steve.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.916
Steve?
- It's a pretty name.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.916
Steve sounds nice.
- Ya, and a lot less scary, Steve.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.125
Oh, great and powerful 
Steve,
what do you want?

13:00.291 --> 13:02.250
I don't think he can speak.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.625
I heard that, young man.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.791
You get over here right now!

13:07.500 --> 13:09.791
Hammy, get back here.
- But Steve is angry.

13:10.041 --> 13:13.166
I think it came from the other side of Steve,
I mean the bush, I mean...jeez...

13:16.791 --> 13:19.875
Look there's only one way we can find out
what this thing is.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.125
and what this is all about,
I'm gonna go check it out.

13:32.666 --> 13:34.125
Steve ate Verne!

13:34.791 --> 13:37.541
Alright Steve, you brought this on yourself.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.291
Stella, don't.
I'm not eaten.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.041
I just tripped.

13:43.291 --> 13:46.000
I'm gonna go over there,
don't anybody move.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.791
What is this place?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.666
Hey there, little...

14:29.416 --> 14:29.875
fella.

15:09.916 --> 15:12.166
Good day, can I help you?

15:14.541 --> 15:16.291
Oh, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

15:34.041 --> 15:37.041
What was that?
- Mama, get him.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.541
What was over there?
Freaky, pink primates.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.916
They must have come while we were hibernating
and they...it was awful.

15:43.916 --> 15:46.791
They had wheels on their feet,
and they had these sticks.

15:46.791 --> 15:50.541
And they were whacking me with these sticks
like it was some kind of sick game.

15:50.666 --> 15:54.291
You should have died!
You should have laid down, and died.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.625
That's not the worst part,
half the forest is gone!

15:59.291 --> 16:04.541
All the trees, the berry bushes,
they're just, gone.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.375
What will we do for food?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.791
I don't know.
But, here's what I do know.

16:14.041 --> 16:18.041
We will be fine as long as no one 
goes over Steve again.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.041
It's called a hedge.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.041
And it is not to be feared
my amphibious friend.

16:22.541 --> 16:25.375
It is the gateway to the good life.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.916
I'm a reptile actually, 
but you know it's a common mistake.

16:30.041 --> 16:34.000
And you are?
- Oh, where are my manners?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.791
I'm RJ.
Now please don't think I'm prying.

16:36.875 --> 16:42.416
But I couldn't help overhearing, and I 
think I can shed a little light on what this 
whole hedge situation is about.

16:42.541 --> 16:45.291
You see, what was once mere wilderness 
is now...

16:45.291 --> 16:49.625
54 acres of man-made manicured 
air-condtioned paradise.

16:49.666 --> 16:52.875
Except for that little bitty speck,
you are here.

16:53.291 --> 16:56.541
Noo, that's a good thing.
You're hibernaters right?

16:56.875 --> 16:59.000
Gather up a bunch of food, 
store it away for the winter?

16:59.291 --> 17:00.416
Uh-huh, we fill the log.

17:01.125 --> 17:04.165
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

17:04.165 --> 17:06.415
All the way to the top.
- Ozzie!

17:07.125 --> 17:10.790
Let me ask kid?
How long does it take, to fill the log?

17:10.915 --> 17:12.540
274 days.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.290
Ever done it in a week?

17:15.415 --> 17:17.415
That's impossible.
- Not if we work together.

17:18.290 --> 17:22.125
You see, you've got the food gathering skills, 
I've got
the know-how, and they've got the food!

17:22.125 --> 17:24.040
How much food?
- Loads of food!

17:24.040 --> 17:26.750
Heaps of food!
Food out the wa-zoo!

17:27.125 --> 17:31.625
Well, you know whatever food comes 
out of the wa-zoo,
I don't think we're really 
interested in eating.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.916
I don't know, the guy's making a lot of 
sense to me.
I think we should listen.

17:34.916 --> 17:38.291
Yea...I'm ok with wa-zoo food.
- No, you're not.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.916
The tail is tingling.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.750
The what,
is what?

17:43.750 --> 17:45.916
When something doesn't feel right
my tail tingles.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.916
And let me tell you something.
Everything you said so far is 
driving my tail crazy.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.791
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something 
you need to be afraid of.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.166
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

17:57.791 --> 18:01.750
This is not a birthmark.
- Cos' you went over there without a guide Verne.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.291
Whatever, thanks for stopping by,
we're not interested.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.791
Not interested in the most delicious 
food you've ever tasted?

18:08.375 --> 18:11.625
Come on.
- Not, interested.

18:11.625 --> 18:19.625
Ok, I get it. I understand.
This is 
something you're just not open to.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.500
What is that?!

18:33.666 --> 18:35.666
That my friend is
a magical combination of...

18:35.666 --> 18:41.291
corn, dehydrated cheese solids,
VHA, VHT and good'ol MSG.

18:41.416 --> 18:45.000
Aka, the chip.
Nacho cheese flavour.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.875
Damn, Verne, those were good.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.916
It's all good,
and we're going over there, tonight.

18:56.791 --> 18:59.625
Welcome, to suburbia.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.791
Hey mom, look at us.

19:11.666 --> 19:12.541
How's that tail, Verne?

19:12.875 --> 19:17.416
Listen, if anybody in this family 
gets hurt, I'm holding you personally responsible.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.666
They're having a good time,
I'll take responsibility for that.

19:24.666 --> 19:28.416
Hey Verno, I took a few clippings 
out of my quills
to do a little comparison,

19:28.541 --> 19:31.875
Look at this,
the grass seems to 
be greener over here.

19:32.041 --> 19:36.041
Verne, are you certain you 
came to the same place?
- Yeah, cos you know the racoon says...

19:36.041 --> 19:38.541
Ok, enough about him.
I get it.

19:38.541 --> 19:42.416
So, he can do a couple of tricks,
I mean it's not like he can walk on water.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.750
Hey, everybody.
This way to the food.

19:48.041 --> 19:51.291
What is that?
- That is an SUV.

19:51.416 --> 19:55.416
Humans ride around in it,
because they are slowly losing their ability to walk.

19:55.541 --> 19:59.000
Jeepers, that's so big.
- How many humans fit in there?

19:59.041 --> 20:00.666
Usually?
One.

20:02.125 --> 20:05.000
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp,
your president.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.875
Of the Home-owners Association.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.500
What is that?
- Easy, easy. Don't worry.

20:10.541 --> 20:15.041
That's just a human being.
And 
they're just as scared of us, as we are of them.

20:15.041 --> 20:18.541
Now, if a human does happen to see you,
just lay down...

20:18.625 --> 20:21.791
roll over, and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.250
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed to be 2 inches.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.291
But, according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.791
Can we just get the food
and go?

20:31.791 --> 20:35.916
Do they have it or not?
- Din't you see, it was in the box.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.166
They always got food with them.
We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.041
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.541
The human mouth,
is called the piehole.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.166
The human being, is called the couch potato.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.791
That is the device
to summon food.

20:52.791 --> 20:55.166
That is one of the many
voices of food.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.916
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.416
That is where the many food 
transportation occurs.

21:01.416 --> 21:04.791
Humans bring the food, 
take the food,
ship the food.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.666
They drive the food.
They wear the food.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.291
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.250
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.750
Whadda' ya know,
food!

21:17.416 --> 21:20.791
That is the altar
where they worship food.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.125
That's what they need 
when they've eaten too much food.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.791
That get rids of the guilt
so they can eat more food!

21:26.375 --> 21:27.916
Food!
Food!
Food!

21:30.791 --> 21:32.875
So, you think they have enough?

21:34.125 --> 21:37.791
Well they don't. 
For humans,
enough is never enough.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.541
And what do they do with 
the stuff they don't eat?

21:41.666 --> 21:47.375
They put it in gleaming,  
silver cans.
Just for us.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.416
Dig in!

21:55.791 --> 21:57.125
Good, isn't it?

22:03.416 --> 22:07.625
That's a diaper,
and that does 
come out of a wa-zoo.

22:09.541 --> 22:12.750
What do you think, was i right,
or was i right?

22:12.750 --> 22:14.916
And these things are just the scraps!

22:15.291 --> 22:18.041
Wait till you see what comes in the boxes,
and the packages, and the cans.

22:18.750 --> 22:22.041
You stick with me, and in one week 
we'll gather enough food to...

22:23.041 --> 22:24.541
to feed a bear!

22:26.250 --> 22:27.250
Just, figure of speech.

22:30.541 --> 22:33.000
Halt!
Intruders! Intruders!

22:33.000 --> 22:35.291
Get out, all of you!
- What is it, Skapy?

22:37.750 --> 22:40.125
What are you doing?
- You said we should lick our...

22:40.125 --> 22:42.166
No! Next step!
Run!

22:43.500 --> 22:45.250
Run!
- Get out of here!

22:49.166 --> 22:51.500
I just bought this patio.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.416
You kids ok?
Hon, you alright there?

23:01.416 --> 23:05.416
See what i mean?
That's what I was talking about.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.500
This humans don't want us around.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.791
So, we scared her and she overreacted.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.666
No biggie.
- No biggie?

23:11.666 --> 23:14.000
Ohh...That is what we call a biggie.

23:14.125 --> 23:17.041
Come on, think about all the food,
it was worth it for that food.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.791
That stuff is to die for.

23:21.166 --> 23:25.416
Let me rephrase that.
- No, to die for, you nailed that part.

23:25.541 --> 23:29.500
Seems our little forest life looks too
primitive to a guy with a bag.

23:30.416 --> 23:33.500
But I think I speak for the whole family
when I say we want nothing...

23:33.541 --> 23:35.875
to do with anything 
that's over that hedge.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.041
Oh, come on.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.041
Y'all haven't even tried donuts yet.

23:42.250 --> 23:45.375
You want to store fat?
That is the way to store some fat.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.291
You'll be sweating through the winter.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.916
Ok, alright, you guys sleep on it.

23:52.041 --> 23:55.000
Good idea, I'm gonna check back with ya.

23:57.041 --> 24:00.500
Shoot!
Almost had it.

24:32.041 --> 24:34.666
...food...

24:37.041 --> 24:40.541
Time's up, RJ.
- But I have six more days!

24:46.416 --> 24:50.625
Ohh...four paws, fur,
still alive...still alive.

25:08.541 --> 25:12.375
Ok kids, dive in, there it is.
Bark for breakfast.

25:12.666 --> 25:15.916
I want a donut.
- I want pizza.

25:33.916 --> 25:36.375
Ok, this is great.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.250
Granted, it takes some time to chew.

25:48.416 --> 25:53.750
That was very satisfying.
And by the way, lots of fibre in there too.

25:56.791 --> 26:00.041
I gotta admit
that does look tasty.

26:00.166 --> 26:04.916
What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you with your... foraging thing.

26:05.166 --> 26:11.166
Look, Verne. You said a word yesterday,
about your little gang here, starts with an F.

26:11.166 --> 26:12.166
Do you remember what it was?

26:13.250 --> 26:17.416
Family?
- Right. 
You know, that got me right here.

26:17.750 --> 26:23.416
You see, Verne. I used to have all that.
My own place, surrounded by loved ones.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.250
Universal remote.

26:25.291 --> 26:29.916
But then all that went away with the...
weed-hack incident.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.250
Ohh...come here.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.666
Jeepers, Verne.
- We could always use 
the extra hand there, you know.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.666
The weed-hacker, Verne.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.166
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

26:51.541 --> 26:55.250
This is me, going.

26:59.416 --> 27:03.166
Sure I'll see you around the forest.

27:04.500 --> 27:09.041
Hey, RJ.
You can stay.

27:10.500 --> 27:14.416
Come here you big!
I knew beneath 
that hard, is crispy outside...

27:14.416 --> 27:18.041
there's a soft, noughety center in there.
You mind if i call you Uncle Verne?

27:18.291 --> 27:21.916
With every bone in my body.
- Great. Hey, can i walk with Hammy?

27:23.416 --> 27:27.666
You want to help me find my nuts?
Very tempting, Hammy.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.791
But first, I want to show you this.

27:31.416 --> 27:32.791
You like this cookie?

27:33.666 --> 27:35.166
Well this cookie is...
Junk!

27:35.166 --> 27:36.875
I like the cookie.

27:37.625 --> 27:43.916
Don't worry, I know where we can get 
some cookie
 so valuable that they are 
hand-delivered by uniformed officers.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.125
And there they are, 
America's most coveted cookies.

27:51.125 --> 27:55.125
Love-handles, Skinny-Mints,
Neener-Neeners 
and Smackeroons!

27:55.166 --> 27:57.125
And guess what,
they're all yours!

27:58.916 --> 28:01.541
Woah Hamilton,
hold on there fella.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.541
I love your energy,
but you can't just take 'em.

28:03.625 --> 28:04.666
But you just said they're mine.

28:04.666 --> 28:09.916
They will be if we successfully 
marry your manic 
energy to my brilliant plan.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.791
You with me kid?
- I, i, i..

28:11.791 --> 28:13.541
The eyes have it, let's ride.

28:24.375 --> 28:26.541
You step away from those cookies
They're mine.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.750
Hey, this guy's not coming is he?
Cos i don't want him to.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.916
Ohh...I've got so much work to do.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.875
Come here, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.916
What we're going for here is a
vicious, 
man-eating, rabid squirrel.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.791
Can you handle that?
- Excuse me.

28:42.916 --> 28:44.666
Yes, Hammy.

28:46.541 --> 28:48.416
Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly.

28:49.041 --> 28:51.416
Rabid, not rabbit.

28:54.625 --> 28:56.416
Ok, first watch the hair...

29:01.416 --> 29:02.791
...on the tail...

29:04.416 --> 29:05.625
...liking that alot.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.541
Show me that look in your eye, boy! C'mon!

29:09.666 --> 29:13.416
Oh, I can burp my ABCs!
A, B, C...

29:14.625 --> 29:17.666
I just really need you to focus right now, ok?

29:35.791 --> 29:38.416
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.250
Go on, get out there.
Shoo. Shoo!

29:41.416 --> 29:46.416
I'm a crazy rabid-squirrel.
I want my cookies!

29:55.250 --> 29:57.166
Rabies!

29:57.166 --> 29:58.875
Hey, it's working.
- Behind you!

29:58.875 --> 30:00.250
I know you're,
right behind m...

30:06.250 --> 30:08.791
Walk it off,
just walk that one off.

30:08.791 --> 30:11.541
What is going on? Is that Hammy?
- Everything's under control, 
just go back to the hedge.

30:11.541 --> 30:14.541
You call that under control?
He's under attack!

30:14.541 --> 30:15.541
He's working.
- I'm coming, Hammy.

30:35.416 --> 30:40.166
Verne, that was great.
You, my friend, are a natural.

30:40.416 --> 30:43.750
Or should I say, "all-naturale".

30:48.916 --> 30:53.166
Hammy, you are awesome my man.
You had me scared.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.666
I was about to come out
 and beat you 
with a book myself.

31:02.541 --> 31:06.291
There! He was right over there.
- That's where the squirrel attacked us.

31:06.291 --> 31:10.541
He has like rabies or something.
- And there was this gross, naked amphibian thing.

31:10.541 --> 31:12.250
Reptile.

31:13.625 --> 31:16.791
It's ok girls, go inside have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

31:17.416 --> 31:21.666
I'm sorry Janice,
did I just hear them say 
rabid-squirrel.

31:21.791 --> 31:25.166
Oh, I think they might just be overreacting.
- But what if they're not?

31:25.166 --> 31:30.541
What if we have a potential pandemic on our 
hands.
Vermin running loose, spreading diseases

31:30.791 --> 31:32.750
and lowering our property value.

31:34.416 --> 31:39.000
Yea...I have casserole in the oven. 
Gotta run.
- Fine, you worry about your casserole.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.541
And I'll worry about the end of Suburbia 
for peace and tranquility.

31:45.916 --> 31:51.041
That's right, don't push, plenty for everybody.
Got a box right over here for you, Penny.

31:51.041 --> 31:55.666
Oh jeepers, that is good, kids eat up. 
Anything that taste this good, has to be good for you.

31:55.666 --> 32:00.625
You feel that buzzing at the back of you skull?
That's called sugar-rush. It's what keeps the humans going.

32:00.666 --> 32:03.875
That's why they don't hibernate.
To top that off, a little of this...

32:03.916 --> 32:07.500
and what usually takes you all summer,
is only gonna take us a week.

32:09.291 --> 32:12.875
Oh, hold on, HamSquad!
The last thing 
you need is caffeine.

32:15.666 --> 32:20.541
That's right, come on, dig in
 because this 
my friends is just the beginning.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.041
Hello, I need every business list 
that you have under 'exterminator'.

34:27.125 --> 34:29.291
Can I poke him?
- No!

34:34.291 --> 34:38.041
Debbie, I don't remember seeing a 
permit out for
 a gathering.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.125
Groups of more than one who wish to get...AHH!

34:40.791 --> 34:43.291
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

34:47.791 --> 34:51.041
Lights fading.
Limbs growing cold.

34:58.041 --> 35:01.416
Mother, is that you?
Beckoning me into the light?

35:01.416 --> 35:03.541
Must...move...
toward...the...light.

35:03.666 --> 35:07.916
What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knock he's brain or something.

35:08.125 --> 35:12.166
I'm telling you. You went to far this time.
Let's just get out of here and leave this...

35:13.166 --> 35:14.250
Nice catch, Verne.

35:16.291 --> 35:18.541
You're dangerous, you're insane.

35:22.666 --> 35:25.750
Goodbye, cruel world.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.541
Rose-bud.

35:36.416 --> 35:39.041
Now can i poke him?
- Nooo!

35:39.166 --> 35:44.500
U see, this is exactly why I called the 
exterminator,
to kill them, before they get hurt like this.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.791
Everybody get out of here, right now.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.291
Right. Ok, grab those handles.

36:01.875 --> 36:02.416
Verminator.

36:21.416 --> 36:28.666
I believed someone phoned about an 
animal problem.
The solution is standing before you.

36:28.666 --> 36:33.625
Dwayne is here.
- Where have you been?

36:33.666 --> 36:39.041
I'm throwing a 'welcome to the 
neighbourhood' party tomorrow and so far 
Debbie's car have killed more animals than you have.

36:39.041 --> 36:46.041
Stand down sister, I personally 
guarantee 
that there will not be a living thing at this party.

36:46.041 --> 36:49.416
Verminator is on the job.

36:49.500 --> 36:53.041
Leave it.
- Ahh, what do we have here?

36:54.250 --> 37:02.625
Didelphis marsupialis virginiananis,
approximately 10 pounds, male.

37:03.041 --> 37:08.750
I think he's dead.
- O really, do you in fact have an associate's 
degree from Vermtech?

37:08.791 --> 37:11.541
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

37:11.625 --> 37:14.166
Move, move. That's it, hurry, run.

37:17.666 --> 37:20.791
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

37:22.291 --> 37:24.916
Kill it!
- Thank you all for coming.

37:25.166 --> 37:26.916
You were a great audience.

37:30.166 --> 37:33.541
Alright, what am I up against here.

37:33.666 --> 37:40.000
Possum, porcupine, skunk,
squirrel, 
racoon, amphibian.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.791
Reptile.
- No, reptile...

37:49.041 --> 37:55.666
That's what I call a superduper performance 
there fella.
- Oz! You were riveted man, you were awesome!

37:58.375 --> 38:02.500
Dad, I guess I gotta say uhh...
That was pretty good.

38:03.291 --> 38:07.166
Props for the Ozman!

38:08.041 --> 38:12.666
Let's not forget our brilliant leadership, RJ.

38:17.041 --> 38:20.291
Come this way, we want to show you something.
- Yeah, sure.

38:20.375 --> 38:22.041
Sweet.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.416
What a team.

38:30.666 --> 38:35.250
Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on, we want to show you something. 
Hurry!

38:35.375 --> 38:37.166
Check it out.

38:40.541 --> 38:42.541
Your new home.

38:47.041 --> 38:51.666
Look, we got a place for you right here.
- That's for me?

38:51.750 --> 38:55.416
Yea, is this anything like what you had, RJ?

38:56.291 --> 38:58.791
This is everything like 
what I had, Lou.

38:59.875 --> 39:02.750
Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.125
Is that my bag?
- Yea, we brought it here so you wouldn't...

39:07.125 --> 39:09.375
have to sleep up in that old tree.

39:11.375 --> 39:14.916
Hey RJ, check this out,
we totally hooked up the TV.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.916
I hotwired the HD-converter.
- We get like a thousand channels.

39:19.541 --> 39:24.416
Here, can you take the remote before my dad does.
- Wow, universal remote.

39:26.416 --> 39:29.250
This is nice guys.
Really nice.

39:30.666 --> 39:34.041
We now return to
'A Scoundrel Among Us'.

39:34.166 --> 39:38.541
You should be ashamed of yourself!
We let you into our family and you deceived us.

39:38.666 --> 39:42.375
I give you my heart
and you ripped it 
into a million pieces.

39:42.666 --> 39:46.000
Get real , Kevin.
Cos when you feel like a dirtbag.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.625
It's because you're a dirtbag, right?
So just say it our loud, 'I am a dirtbag'.

39:52.916 --> 39:58.041
Dirtbag? I don't think that guy is a real doctor.
What do yo think there, RJ?

40:04.041 --> 40:08.250
Woah RJ, what are you doing man.
You're getting in way too deep.

40:09.041 --> 40:11.791
Just get the food, feed the bear.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.041
Where's the food?!!

40:26.416 --> 40:30.041
Verne, what are you doing?
- I'm putting things back to the way they were.

40:30.125 --> 40:35.291
No don't. How about if I just leave?
- Good, you leave and i return this stuff to the 
rightful owners.

40:35.416 --> 40:39.875
What? why?!
- Because... we've angered the humans.

40:39.875 --> 40:42.166
And we don't want to end up like that rabbit.

40:42.166 --> 40:47.291
Hence, I'm giving this back,
so they won't kill us.

40:47.416 --> 40:51.041
Verne, you don't understand.
We need this stuff.

40:51.166 --> 40:54.041
No, we don't.
- You can't take it.

40:54.166 --> 40:57.166
Yes I can.
- Let go.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.666
You let go.
- I have to have it.

41:13.666 --> 41:16.875
Verne, move slowly,
keep your voice 
low and follow me.

41:22.916 --> 41:27.166
No, I'm not falling for anymore of 
your smooth talk.

41:28.291 --> 41:31.916
Idon't knw what you're up to but, 
my whole shell is tingling...

41:32.041 --> 41:36.791
and you know what, I'm listening to it this time.
And I'm putting my foot down.

41:37.875 --> 41:38.791
Play?

41:42.666 --> 41:43.916
Play!

42:01.166 --> 42:03.416
Let's play.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.291
Get down boy! Sit! Rollover!

42:20.791 --> 42:23.541
Atta'boy Verne, save the food,
I'll lose the dog.

42:35.791 --> 42:39.125
You're dropping all the food, man! 
Here, catch.

42:40.916 --> 42:42.916
You hungry?
Look, food!

42:47.375 --> 42:50.291
Look, people, play with them.

42:55.291 --> 42:58.166
I'm alright, I'm fine.

43:02.375 --> 43:04.375
Verne, unhook the chain.

43:28.625 --> 43:30.916
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.416
You're the devil.

44:26.791 --> 44:29.791
Verne, you alright there?
Give me a hand, Oz.

44:30.791 --> 44:36.041
What the heck happened?
- It's gone...the food! Gone!

44:36.041 --> 44:40.166
What? How is it gone?
- Ask...him.

44:42.416 --> 44:46.291
I returned it to it's rightful owners.

44:46.291 --> 44:53.250
We like, worked our tails off you know,
like alot, and the food we got was totally...you know.

44:53.375 --> 44:55.041
You're like a...whatever.

44:55.041 --> 44:59.666
What were you thinking? 
The log was full.
- Full of junk.

44:59.791 --> 45:03.291
Ohh, so what are you saying?
That the food we gathered our way...

45:03.416 --> 45:06.125
isn't as good as the food
we gathered your way?

45:06.125 --> 45:10.791
Your way? You mean his way.
Can't you see RJ is just using you?

45:12.041 --> 45:14.541
Shame on you, RJ wouldn't do that.

45:14.666 --> 45:18.791
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand there's something wrong with this guy?

45:18.875 --> 45:22.166
My tail tingles everytime
I get near him.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.375
So, we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

45:25.500 --> 45:28.916
I'm starting to think that the little tingle of your 
s
is just you being jealous.

45:29.041 --> 45:34.916
Jealous? Of him?
- Yea, he's embracing the future and 
you're just holding us back.

45:35.041 --> 45:37.791
I'm holding you back alright,
from extinction!

45:37.916 --> 45:41.541
See what you've done here?
If 
you listen to half of the stuff you're telling them...

45:41.625 --> 45:42.916
You'll be dead within a week!

45:42.916 --> 45:48.166
You are only interested in taking 
advantage of them 
because they are too 
stupid and naive.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.000
I'm not stupid.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.875
I didn't mean...
I meant ignorant.

46:04.166 --> 46:10.625
The way's over there, come on you guys, 
you know I didn't mean it like that.

46:10.625 --> 46:14.416
Don't do this, Stella, Ozzie.

46:16.125 --> 46:18.666
Hammy, you know I...

46:21.291 --> 46:24.000
Hammy?
- I'm not stupid.

47:12.416 --> 47:15.416
Goodnight, Uncle RJ.
- Goodnight kiddo.

47:22.625 --> 47:26.291
Moon's full, RJ.
See you in the morning.

48:02.375 --> 48:04.041
I got ya.

48:10.541 --> 48:13.166
Is it done?
- Affirmative.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.666
And did you put this one in?
This D-Ultra-Turbo?

48:15.666 --> 48:20.791
That's a contraband item,  Mdm.
As it is illegal in every state, except Texas.

48:20.916 --> 48:24.791
I don't care if this thing is against 
the Geneva conventions, I want it!

48:25.416 --> 48:29.541
I thought you might.
So, I took the liberty of  
installing it for you.

48:32.541 --> 48:36.416
Adios, animal infestation.

48:57.041 --> 48:58.666
What have I done?

49:00.916 --> 49:03.916
I shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

49:03.916 --> 49:09.375
I shouldn't have taken all that food.
I was just trying to return things to the way 
they were, that's all.

49:09.416 --> 49:11.916
I was just being cautious,
cos that's what I am.

49:12.041 --> 49:14.166
I'm naturally tentative.

49:14.291 --> 49:17.000
There's even places in my shell 
I've haven't been.

49:17.041 --> 49:21.875
You, on the other hand,
you're like cool, 
and crazy and fearless.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.416
I think they're right,
I think I'm just jealous.

49:26.291 --> 49:30.500
Verne, believe me,
you should 
not be jealous of me.

49:31.375 --> 49:35.041
You've got a good thing here.
You're just trying to do what's best for your family.

49:35.166 --> 49:36.791
I think you're what's best for them now.

49:38.041 --> 49:39.416
What about your tail?

49:40.916 --> 49:48.250
My head says listen to my tail, 
my tail says listen to my head.
I just end up with an upset stomach.

49:48.291 --> 49:52.291
That's why you need to be in charge now.
- You don't really know what's going on here...

49:52.375 --> 49:57.250
And, you do. So, what's the problem?
- This is the problem.

49:57.291 --> 50:00.166
See this?
- I'm listening.

50:01.250 --> 50:03.291
Just, hang on a second.

50:05.166 --> 50:09.250
Hi, uh... you're the lady throwing the party?
- Yes, just to the right.

50:09.291 --> 50:13.166
There are protective
put on over your shoes.

50:17.166 --> 50:20.916
What is this?
- What?

50:21.000 --> 50:27.041
That...is a list of...
all the 
stuff that you lost, Verne.

50:27.166 --> 50:32.791
It's a big long list.
- You're an organised little guy aren't you.

50:32.916 --> 50:37.291
But, you know what. 
I know a place that is choked full of food.
We can get it all back in one night.

50:37.416 --> 50:41.291
Great, Let's go. Where is it?
- Inside that house.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.875
What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

50:48.916 --> 50:54.416
What Verne is trying to say is,
well it's hard to really sum it all up in just one word...

50:55.166 --> 50:57.041
I'm sorry.

50:59.041 --> 51:02.916
Come here.
- Give me a hug.

51:03.041 --> 51:06.125
Ok listen, here is the plan.

51:06.166 --> 51:18.916
Traps are set here, here, here, 
here, here...and here.

51:25.750 --> 51:26.916
Big one here.

51:28.916 --> 51:32.166
Maybe a few over here.
- Sheesh, is that all?

51:32.291 --> 51:37.041
No, there's a bunch of red lights all over here.
- you ok Verne, looking a little faint.

51:37.166 --> 51:43.166
I blacked out for a second there, 
but I get the idea.
There's lights, traps, I think i need to change my shell.

51:43.291 --> 51:46.416
Ok, this is us. 
- Can I be the car?

51:46.666 --> 51:49.416
I wanna be the car.
- No, I'm the car! You be the shoes.

51:49.541 --> 51:53.541
Shoe is lame.
Why don't you be that 
snazzy lokking iron there.

51:53.625 --> 51:57.916
Hey, it's not important.
Besides I'm the car, I'm always the car.

51:58.041 --> 52:01.791
Now the plan works in 3 simple steps:
Step one: Clear the lights.

52:01.875 --> 52:05.875
Step Two: Get inside.
Step Three: Get out with a mountain of food.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.666
This place is like a fortress, walls so high,
doors impenetrable.

52:10.791 --> 52:13.791
How do we get in?
- The collar is the key.

52:14.666 --> 52:19.416
Literally, the collar is like
a key that opens the door...

52:19.541 --> 52:25.000
and what, you think he's just gonna 
hand over his collar to you?
- Not to me my femme fatale...to you.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.291
Her?
- Me?

52:26.375 --> 52:31.125
You Stella, we'll get that cat to give 
you that collar by using...
- My stink.

52:31.166 --> 52:33.041
Your feminine charm.

52:34.041 --> 52:35.916
Was that out loud?

52:36.000 --> 52:44.041
Look racoon, maybe that ass 
you're wearing is obstructing your view, 
but if you haven't notice, I'm a skunk.

52:44.041 --> 52:50.666
Outside maybe, but I'm looking inside Stella, a
nd i see 
a fox. All we gotta do is get her out.

52:55.750 --> 52:58.291
Scissors.
- Scissors?!

52:59.041 --> 53:00.541
Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

53:02.416 --> 53:04.166
Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

53:04.166 --> 53:06.500
Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.291
Alright we scored! Yeah!

53:15.666 --> 53:19.250
One more thing.
Woah stop. That's it.

53:19.375 --> 53:23.791
Ladies and gentlemen, 
our work here is done.

53:25.416 --> 53:30.666
Big jeepers.
- She's all like...wow!

53:53.541 --> 53:58.000
Alright gang, this is it. We're going in.

54:04.541 --> 54:12.750
Oh, not again. 
Damn it, those things are so life-like.
Curse you, plastic mouldsmen.

54:50.416 --> 54:53.625
Go, go, go.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.541
No, no, no...No!

54:58.041 --> 55:01.875
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk
.
- I love the cookie.

55:02.791 --> 55:06.666
What's going on?
Is everything ok?

55:11.791 --> 55:17.416
Here we go.
Come on Hammy, follow the red light.

55:19.416 --> 55:24.000
That's it, that's it.
There it is. 
Go and get it.

55:33.166 --> 55:35.666
Go get it, you little nut.

55:37.791 --> 55:39.625
Bingo!
Ok, step two.

55:39.666 --> 55:42.916
I thought we'd be dead by step two
so this is going great!

55:45.041 --> 55:48.041
Ok, gorgeous. You're on.

55:50.541 --> 55:55.166
Man...This better be one stupid cat.
- Audio, go!

55:58.416 --> 56:03.041
She must be a cat. Turn it on cat. 
Let's hope the cat likes a cow.

56:03.166 --> 56:05.125
Who goes there?

56:05.291 --> 56:08.291
You're a cat.
- You're a cat.

56:09.416 --> 56:11.541
Uhh, I mean I'm a cat.

56:13.416 --> 56:19.791
Ya, I know, shoo, go, get away from 
here.
My owner those not give scraps
to common strays.

56:19.791 --> 56:22.625
Common strays?
- Alright, you asked for it...

56:22.625 --> 56:27.250
Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.
- Mind if I have a look?

56:27.250 --> 56:31.666
No, come no closer. I must not be so near
a creature of the outdoor woods.

56:33.166 --> 56:38.166
Away with your filth.
- My filth? My filth?!

56:38.166 --> 56:39.166
Here we go.

56:39.291 --> 56:45.791
I'm sick and tired of everybody 
taking one look at me
and running 
away cos they think I'm filthy.

56:45.916 --> 56:53.416
Well, I got news for you, I din't get all 
prim and preen
to have some 
overfed papa's puff ball tell me he's too good for me.

56:53.541 --> 56:57.916
I got make-up on my butt, dude.
And you don't even wanna know about the cork.

56:58.041 --> 57:02.291
Stop, no one has ever spoken to me like that.

57:04.041 --> 57:07.791
It's bold. I like it.

57:10.041 --> 57:14.916
Well believe me, there's more 
where that came from,
puffball.

57:15.125 --> 57:20.125
Alright team, let's boogie.
- Your essence is over-powering.

57:20.250 --> 57:24.416
What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

57:24.500 --> 57:29.791
They are luminous.
- Luminous? Damn.

57:30.000 --> 57:36.375
You know, this is the part where 
I blacked out.
Do the little shoes and cars actually get into the house?

57:37.625 --> 57:43.291
So, you got a name?
- Yes, it's a persian name of cos, I am persian.

57:43.416 --> 57:50.875
I was born, Prince Tigerias Mammoeth Shabbas.
- Ooh, that's a mouthful. Can I just call you Tiger?

57:56.625 --> 58:00.416
Animals we're in the house.

58:16.416 --> 58:19.041
Ok, stations everybody. Let's boogie.

58:19.416 --> 58:21.041
No grip, no grip, no grip.

58:22.791 --> 58:25.375
Hammy, that's called a warpath.

58:27.416 --> 58:28.416
That hurt.

58:38.791 --> 58:42.875
What is that?
- That's just the sound of my heart. 
Can't you hear it?

58:49.166 --> 58:51.166
This way, this way.

58:56.916 --> 58:59.750
Ok, we're good.
Go back to work.

59:13.666 --> 59:18.666
Yes, we're gonna make it.
- My father, he had an exceptionaly flat face.

59:18.750 --> 59:23.375
It was so beautiful, he could barely breathe.
- Fascinating.

59:23.416 --> 59:28.750
Inside we have a multi-level, climbing,
tri-carpet, 
come, I'll show you.

59:28.791 --> 59:31.000
No! I haven't told you about
 my life.

59:31.125 --> 59:33.541
Good, good. Going great.

59:35.291 --> 59:39.041
What is that?
- That is what get the 
humans out of bed in the morning.

59:42.125 --> 59:45.041
Where'd she go?
- Get down, stay down.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:15.500
Come on, we gotta go
 before she comes back.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:19.791
No, not without those Spuddies.
- What?

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:23.375
Lou, Penny, check the TV.
Heather, 
keep an eye on that human.

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.416
I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather, wait.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:30.375
The tingle.
Hey RJ, the wagon's full. 
Let's get out of here.

01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:33.166
Hang on Vincent. 
This'll only take a second.
- Vincent?

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.166
Where?
- Whose Vincent?

01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:38.666
Ohh..Verne, Vincent. 
Simple slip of the bear.
The tongue!

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:42.750
Uhh, just bare with me, is what I meant to say.

01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:45.791
There's no bear.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.291
Lights fading, limbs growing...

01:01:06.541 --> 01:01:10.125
There's a dead white rat on my staircase.

01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:18.041
I thought you were dead.
- I learnt from the best dad.

01:01:18.166 --> 01:01:20.250
That's my girl.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.625
Come to papa.
- We gotta hurry. 
We don't have much time.

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:26.666
What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing.

01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:30.000
Well then, let's get out of 
here cos we have what we need.
- No we don't.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:32.500
What are you talking about,
we 
have more then enough!

01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:36.666
Listen, I have about this small to hand over 
that wagon load of food to a homicidal bear.

01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:41.000
And this Spuddies are on the menu,
or I will be. 
Now, let go off my tail.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:44.791
What?
- Let go.

01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:56.000
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Stella, Stella...where are you going?

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:10.750
Look, it's not you, it won't work ok. 
Because I'm a...
- Skunk!!!

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:14.291
Yea, that.
Sorry you have to see this...

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:15.541
Fire-in-the-hole!

01:02:22.916 --> 01:02:27.500
This smell doesn't bother you?
- No, this face was meant for beauty.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:32.041
I cannot smell a thing.
- You can't smell.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:41.416
To the door. Go, go, go.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.666
Run!
-This way.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.500
Let's party.
Party!

01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:55.041
Flee, my love!

01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:59.250
Run!
That way. Outside.

01:03:04.666 --> 01:03:07.791
Buenos días, reptile.

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:15.875
You've just been, verminated.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:22.000
Woah, you stink.
- That's because you let them into my, house...

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:28.750
Stop your honking.
This little guys will be disposed off 
quickly and humanely.

01:03:28.791 --> 01:03:32.750
Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.166
It was a pleasure, 
doing business with you, mdm.

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:59.166
What's he gonna do to us, mama?
- I don't know.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:06.750
I don't wanna die, dad. Not for real.
- There, there, we'll be ok.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:16.416
You were right about him, Verne.
We should have listened, sorry there.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:21.666
I knew we couldn't trust him.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:26.625
I got us into this,
I should have known better.

01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:43.500
So, I was on my way down to kill you.
But, I stopped to watch the show and I have to say..

01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:50.375
...that, right there, is a thing of beauty.

01:04:52.041 --> 01:05:02.291
That is the most vicious, deceitful, s
elf-serving
thing, I've ever seen. Classy, RJ.

01:05:02.416 --> 01:05:07.416
You take the food, and they take the fall.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:17.625
You keep this up, you're gonna end up 
just like me.
Having everything you ever wanted.

01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:22.791
But, I already had that.
- What? Them?

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:28.041
Who're you kidding? 
You said it yourself.
You're a family of one.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:32.916
Always will be.
It's how guys like you and me survive.

01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:38.291
So, a few saps got hurt in the process,
that's life.

01:05:38.416 --> 01:05:41.125
Trust me, you don't need them.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.625
Actually, I do.

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:51.666
And right now, they really need me.

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:54.375
So, I really need this.

01:06:11.541 --> 01:06:13.416
There goes the bag again.
- Are you ok?

01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:24.166
You, sorry...
- Woah, Stella, this is a rescue. 
I'm rescuing you.

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:27.416
I'm gonna gas you so hard,
your grandchildren will stink.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.000
What's that?
Hair?

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.375
Ear?

01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:33.791
Ohh, bear!

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:48.541
We can drive!
- It's just like, Auto Homicide 3.

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:57.791
Let me in.
Verkeerde knopje!

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:00.541
Please, select destination.

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:03.500
Take us home!
Take us to the log.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:06.916
Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.

01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:15.666
Hammy, let me in!
- Not listening to RJ. Lalalalaa....

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.416
Kids! Lose that bear!
- What weapons do we have?

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:22.291
We've got a hammer.
- Cool.

01:07:27.666 --> 01:07:29.166
Thank you. Yes, yes..

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:34.500
Let me in.
- No, ringtailed saboteur.

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.416
He's just trying to help, just let him in.
- After what he did to us?!

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:41.625
But he came back.
- And he brought a bear.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:50.166
Hey, no fighting while we're driving.
- We will turn this van around if you don't stop.

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:53.916
He started it.
- I'm telling you, he's just trying to help us.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But Verne, you're the one who 
always say trust your tail.
- But, it's not tingling.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:02.125
Why din't you say so.

01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.750
You're dead, RJ.

01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:12.291
And your friends are next.

01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:13.291
Look out.

01:08:14.666 --> 01:08:17.166
Make an immediate left turn.

01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:21.666
Bonus points!

01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:43.291
High score!

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.916
You have arrived.

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:18.875
Come on, we gotta go.
- Die oude Jazz-dance blessure.

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:34.875
Lou? Penny? The kids here? 
Hammy?
- Big clown.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:53.416
A weed-hacker!

01:09:56.416 --> 01:10:03.666
Show your little rat faces.
Stay in the woods where you belong!

01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:14.125
You guys wanna party, do you?
Alright then, let's party.

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:22.041
Kids!
Hey, Lou, look out. Down!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Dat is de druppel!
Verne, 
get everybody out of here.

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:29.625
I'll distract him.
- Are you crazy? They'll kill you.

01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:32.375
Look, I'm the one he wants.
Just take care of your family, Verne.

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:36.250
I intend to, whole family.
There's gotta be something we can do.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.375
There's no time!

01:10:47.416 --> 01:10:53.541
Hey Vincent, you were right.
With a Spuddie enough, just isn't enough.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:58.750
Now Hammy, go, go.

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:28.875
- That's the...
- The D-Pelter Turbo, 
prepare for alot of stinging.

01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:11.500
You are a genius, my boy
- Ohh, Thank..youu...

01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:18.666
And Verne, don't you ever fix this shell.
- Yea, glad it's working for you.

01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:20.750
Take it off. Give it back.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:24.375
Here we go,
it's the rockies for you, Smokey.

01:13:24.416 --> 01:13:30.416
U do realise that is a D-Pelter Turbo?
- Officer, please, it was that verminator. He sold it to me.

01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:33.541
This has nothing to do with me.
- Hey, it was in your yard...

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:36.416
your name is written on the contract,
so you can tell it to the judge.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.166
No, it's not my fault. 
Let go of me.
I can't be arrested.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:43.000
I'm president of the Homeowners Association.

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:45.625
She's getting away.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.416
Play?

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:10.916
Over here, Tiger.

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:19.041
So this is the outdoor woods?
I like it.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:29.416
You know RJ, just for the record.
If you told us that all that food you were trying to get is to pay back an angry bear.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.166
We would have given it to you. 
- Really?
Yeah, that's what families do.

01:14:34.291 --> 01:14:38.916
They look out for each other.
- I've never really had anything like that.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:44.875
Believe me, this is the gateway.
This is the gateway to the good life.

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:49.375
Really wish you would have told me that sooner.
- Yeah, well, that's bad communication.

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:53.916
It's, also what families do.
So, 
what do you say? Wanna be part of it?

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.291
Come here.

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:08.291
Welcome to the family.
- Grouphug.

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:13.875
What a first week of spring.
Wait a minute...

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.541
that means there's only 
267 days left till winter.

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:18.291
What we gonna do for food?

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.500
Yes, Hammy.

01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:24.041
I filled the log.

01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:42.041
Look! Look! I found my nuts!!
