02:52.500 --> 02:54.752
Answer the phone!

02:56.462 --> 02:57.546
No answer.

02:57.629 --> 02:59.589
Keep trying -- I'm sure
he's on his way back from...

02:59.673 --> 03:01.258
Definitely on his way.

03:02.426 --> 03:04.428
Why doesn't anybody
answer the phone?!.

03:09.098 --> 03:10.766
Hello?

03:10.850 --> 03:13.227
James, you are so dead.

03:13.269 --> 03:14.103
Shit!

03:17.773 --> 03:18.691
Oh!

03:23.529 --> 03:24.779
Sorry!

03:26.489 --> 03:28.450
Excuse me -- James Clayton.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.368
Sorry I'm late.
I had a water bed emergency.

03:30.452 --> 03:31.536
Bill Rudolph, Dell.

03:31.619 --> 03:33.413
Nice to meet you.
Can I borrow your computer?

03:33.496 --> 03:35.122
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

03:35.205 --> 03:36.123
Hi, guys.

03:36.206 --> 03:38.417
-Hey.

03:40.210 --> 03:41.628
Ah...

03:41.670 --> 03:43.254
It's here somewhere.

03:43.338 --> 03:45.423
Here we go. All right.

03:48.551 --> 03:50.094
At 7:00 this morning,
sound asleep,

03:50.178 --> 03:52.096
I heard this cracking noise --
ripping wood.

03:52.138 --> 03:54.348
I figure it's part of this
logging dream I'm having,

03:54.431 --> 03:56.391
but, no, the bed
is falling through the floor.

03:56.475 --> 03:59.353
Our program uses
existing wireless technology...

03:59.436 --> 04:00.563
Which we modified,

04:00.646 --> 04:02.439
transforming it into
a completely new program.

04:02.522 --> 04:04.107
-And what do you call it?
-"Sp@rtacus."

04:04.191 --> 04:05.734
Why is that?

04:05.776 --> 04:07.110
It was named after
the revolt...

04:07.194 --> 04:09.112
Of the slaves.

04:09.196 --> 04:11.614
-Wireless Webcast.

04:11.656 --> 04:13.074
We have that.

04:13.115 --> 04:15.576
"Sp@rtacus" turns
any specified broadcast terminal

04:15.660 --> 04:17.161
into its slave.

04:17.244 --> 04:18.663
We control the program.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.245
Watch.

04:21.873 --> 04:23.583
Take a look.
Pick a screen.

04:25.627 --> 04:27.087
Hello, Bill Rudolph.

04:30.172 --> 04:33.050
Hey, who is this guy?
Somebody's hacking in.

04:33.133 --> 04:34.718
What is this?

04:43.393 --> 04:44.645
This is wonderful.

04:44.728 --> 04:46.230
Thank you.

04:46.271 --> 04:49.357
Can you, uh, put our logo
on the Sony booths?

04:49.440 --> 04:52.026
Sure...
for the right price.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.488
-We'll talk, yeah?
-Yeah.

04:55.571 --> 04:56.571
Good.

04:57.698 --> 05:01.201
# What if I don't wanna hear
the things you say? #

05:01.284 --> 05:05.080
# Where were you
when I was needy yesterday? #

05:05.122 --> 05:10.710
# You want in with me
now that it's good #

05:10.751 --> 05:13.587
# But it's too little,
too late #

05:13.629 --> 05:17.173
# Time and again,
I've asked you #

05:17.257 --> 05:18.967
# Just for some light #

05:19.009 --> 05:21.302
-Thank you.
- # To show the way #

05:21.386 --> 05:24.638
-Hey.
- # I was in total darkness #

05:24.722 --> 05:26.682
-What would you like?
- # You act like,,, #

05:26.765 --> 05:29.060
I would like
to teach you something.

05:29.227 --> 05:31.104
Okay. I'm pretty busy
right now.

05:31.187 --> 05:34.565
James, the most important
thing you need to know

05:34.648 --> 05:36.108
is that you don't know shit.

05:37.735 --> 05:39.236
What you see...

05:40.988 --> 05:42.905
...what you hear...

05:45.325 --> 05:49.162
Nothing...is...

05:49.245 --> 05:52.039
what it seems.

05:56.752 --> 05:57.669
Drink?

05:57.753 --> 05:58.920
Martini.

05:59.004 --> 06:00.464
Sure.

06:00.505 --> 06:02.590
That's how it begins, you know.

06:02.673 --> 06:05.468
Call will come in a day or two.

06:05.551 --> 06:07.261
His name is John Medica.

06:07.345 --> 06:09.889
He's head of R&D for Dell.

06:09.972 --> 06:13.350
He's gonna invite you out
for martinis.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.519
Before long,
you're gonna be working

06:15.603 --> 06:17.855
out of Advanced Encrypting
in Bethesda.

06:17.938 --> 06:22.067
Five years, you'll get
your first annual trip to Texas.

06:22.150 --> 06:27.572
You got a wife by then,
.5 kids, 200K a year,

06:27.614 --> 06:30.115
and that's it --
that's the whole show.

06:30.199 --> 06:31.617
Then you're dead.

06:31.659 --> 06:35.913
And it all started because
of one nasty little martini.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.709
So you're a recruiter.

06:41.793 --> 06:44.087
That I am.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.220
You're kidding.

06:53.303 --> 06:57.556
Applications for the CIA
are up tenfold.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.767
Wow.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.310
Would I have to kill anyone?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.105
Would you like to?

07:03.188 --> 07:04.982
Beer man -- Heineken?

07:05.065 --> 07:06.732
Yeah, just a sec.

07:06.816 --> 07:09.485
All I know about the CIA is
that they're a bunch of fat,

07:09.568 --> 07:11.904
old white guys who fell asleep
when we needed them most.

07:11.988 --> 07:14.572
Oh, well, like I said,
you don't know shit.

07:14.656 --> 07:15.782
I know what I know.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.701
-Nice meeting you, James.
-You too.

07:17.784 --> 07:20.578
Way I figure, you'll probably
go in the oil business...

07:20.620 --> 07:22.414
Iike your daddy.

07:31.714 --> 07:32.797
Hey!

07:32.880 --> 07:34.215
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:36.342 --> 07:38.594
Did you know my father?

07:41.431 --> 07:45.101
James, I have recruited
and trained and served

07:45.184 --> 07:47.687
with the best
our country has to offer

07:47.729 --> 07:49.480
for over a quarter
of a century.

07:49.522 --> 07:52.149
I am a scary judge of talent.

07:52.232 --> 07:54.234
It's my gift.

07:54.318 --> 07:56.862
I am recruiting you,
Mr. Clayton.

07:56.945 --> 08:00.364
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly CIA material.

08:00.448 --> 08:02.825
You have any idea
what ClA material is?

08:02.908 --> 08:03.951
It's not me.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.661
No? Well, I don't know.

08:05.745 --> 08:09.248
You graduated
top of your class at M.I.T.,

08:09.332 --> 08:11.458
majored in nonlinear
cryptography,

08:11.541 --> 08:14.377
scored off the charts in your
undergrad psych profile test.

08:14.419 --> 08:15.545
Those are confidential.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.505
Yeah, right.

08:17.589 --> 08:21.508
You're agile,
athletic, and...

08:21.592 --> 08:23.510
And what?

08:23.594 --> 08:28.307
You grew up overseas --
Uzbekistan, Brunei...

08:28.390 --> 08:29.683
Venezuela.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.518
Yeah, my father worked
for Shell awhile.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.563
Your father died in 1990...

08:34.605 --> 08:38.357
in a plane crash in Peru.

08:38.399 --> 08:39.942
What's your point?

08:41.027 --> 08:42.153
What's my point?

08:42.236 --> 08:44.405
What the hell you think
my point is?

08:46.448 --> 08:49.326
My name is Walter Burke.

08:49.409 --> 08:52.162
My number's
on the sports page.

08:52.245 --> 08:53.538
Give me a call.

08:53.622 --> 08:56.248
I'll be here
till noon tomorrow.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.919
Very dramatic, James.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.046
I want to talk.
Can we talk?

09:48.130 --> 09:49.381
Yeah.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.923
Where are you?

09:50.965 --> 09:54.218
Well, you know the phone booth
you're calling from?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.678
Yeah.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.431
Turn around.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.606
As you like it.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.483
You're pretty confident.

10:10.525 --> 10:12.235
Well...

10:12.319 --> 10:14.029
Tell me about my father.

10:16.156 --> 10:18.073
You already know, don't you?

10:18.157 --> 10:20.993
I mean, that's why
you're sitting here.

10:21.076 --> 10:23.787
You want answers,
you're in the wrong car, kid.

10:23.871 --> 10:25.956
I only have secrets.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.583
You can't trust
your best friends,

10:28.666 --> 10:30.001
your five senses,

10:30.043 --> 10:32.962
only the little voice
inside you

10:33.046 --> 10:36.257
most civilians
don't even hear --

10:36.299 --> 10:38.008
Iisten to that.

10:39.426 --> 10:41.471
Trust yourself.

10:41.512 --> 10:44.015
I think that's what
your father would have said.

10:46.099 --> 10:48.268
Trust yourself, James.

11:36.312 --> 11:37.230
Can I help you, sir?

11:37.313 --> 11:38.690
James Clayton --
I'm here for an interview.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.483
Just pull in there,
check in with security.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.733
Thank you.

11:50.408 --> 11:51.784
Hey, my name is James Clayton.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.453
I'm here to see Walter Burke.
He's expecting me.

11:54.537 --> 11:57.164
You can wait for him over there.
I'll page him for you.

12:11.303 --> 12:12.679
James.

12:12.762 --> 12:14.097
Hey.

12:15.307 --> 12:19.143
Rule number one --
don't get caught.

12:19.226 --> 12:21.520
Those were good officers.

12:21.604 --> 12:23.105
Good friends.

12:25.524 --> 12:27.191
So, you ready to get started?

12:27.233 --> 12:28.901
Sure.

12:52.465 --> 12:56.302
Have six pull in tight
on F-4.

12:56.344 --> 12:59.055
All right,
now give me some angles,

12:59.138 --> 13:01.807
both tests...both tests.

13:01.891 --> 13:02.975
Tighter.

13:04.225 --> 13:07.187
It's a carbon copy.

13:07.228 --> 13:09.606
F-4 -- yank him.

13:13.442 --> 13:14.985
You've been caught
cheating, pal.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.820
Please leave.

13:17.905 --> 13:19.907
Still got the eyes, Walter.

13:19.990 --> 13:20.991
What's that story,

13:21.075 --> 13:23.660
you saw some old woman
pushing a baby carriage?

13:23.743 --> 13:27.330
And Walter sees the carriage is
riding a little low, so bam!

13:27.413 --> 13:29.374
No questions, blows grandma
right out of her shoes.

13:29.457 --> 13:30.583
Turned out she was Hamas,

13:30.667 --> 13:32.793
and the whole thing was
stuffed with explosives.

13:32.876 --> 13:34.586
She wasn't Hamas,
she was Abu Nidal.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.129
Abu Nidal, that's right.

13:36.171 --> 13:39.258
These war stories --
you just love them, don't you?

13:49.059 --> 13:51.519
Uh, D-4 --

13:51.602 --> 13:54.313
tell him to forget the chick
and finish the test.

13:59.401 --> 14:02.862
Burke says, "Forget the chick
and finish the test."

14:06.533 --> 14:08.325
How do upsetting problems

14:08.409 --> 14:09.493
generally make you feel?

14:09.577 --> 14:10.494
Upset.

14:10.578 --> 14:12.329
And when you get angry,

14:12.371 --> 14:14.540
do you have trouble
staying in control?

14:14.582 --> 14:15.833
Sure.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.792
How do you typically
deal with failure?

14:17.875 --> 14:19.168
Badly.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.920
Have you ever been deliberately
cruel to an animal?

14:21.004 --> 14:22.630
Yes.

14:22.714 --> 14:23.965
Please, elaborate.

14:24.048 --> 14:27.135
For Christmas, I tied wool
reindeer horns to my dog's head.

14:27.218 --> 14:30.346
Would you consider yourself

14:30.430 --> 14:34.183
subjectively firm
or objectively flexible?

14:35.267 --> 14:37.394
Metaphysically wrinkle-free.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.730
Quickly -- would you rather
ride on a train,

14:39.813 --> 14:42.190
dance in the rain,
or feel no pain?

14:52.867 --> 14:54.910
Feel no pain.

14:54.993 --> 14:59.247
I know I said the rain-dancing
thing, but...feel no pain.

15:00.624 --> 15:02.250
Thank you.

15:11.927 --> 15:13.969
God, I hate this.

15:14.053 --> 15:15.721
Hey.

15:15.804 --> 15:16.847
Hi.

15:16.931 --> 15:18.349
I'm James.

15:19.558 --> 15:21.018
Layla.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.894
Like the song.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.855
Yeah.

15:25.897 --> 15:27.649
That's a big coffee.

15:27.732 --> 15:30.235
I'm a big girl.

15:30.318 --> 15:31.526
Sure.

15:31.610 --> 15:33.403
Is your name James Clayton?

15:33.445 --> 15:36.156
James Douglas Clayton.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.575
Just a yes-or-no answer.

15:38.617 --> 15:41.244
Is your name James Clayton?

15:41.285 --> 15:42.536
Yes.

15:42.620 --> 15:47.208
You were born
October 21, 1976?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.875
Yes.

15:48.959 --> 15:51.711
Have you ever worked for
any foreign governments?

15:51.753 --> 15:52.796
No.

15:52.879 --> 15:55.758
Have you taken tranquilizers
today?

15:55.841 --> 15:57.593
No.

16:13.566 --> 16:14.775
Miami.

16:16.693 --> 16:17.735
Mind if I sit here?

16:17.819 --> 16:18.903
Sure.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.575
Hey.
Ronnie Gibson from D.C.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.201
James Clayton from all over.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.910
Nice to meet you.

16:26.952 --> 16:27.911
You too.

16:32.374 --> 16:35.126
You got any idea what those two
are speaking over there?

16:35.209 --> 16:37.044
I think it's Farsi.

16:37.128 --> 16:39.506
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Farsi.

17:27.467 --> 17:28.635
Clear!

18:17.011 --> 18:19.639
Uh, what are you doing?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.391
Nothing.

18:21.474 --> 18:22.433
What?

18:22.475 --> 18:24.769
Some of these chairs
are wired.

18:24.851 --> 18:26.770
They catch you drifting
during this,

18:26.853 --> 18:28.105
10,000 volts up your ass.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.439
Bullshit.

18:29.481 --> 18:31.358
All right.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.110
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

18:33.193 --> 18:35.111
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Dennis Slayne.

18:35.194 --> 18:37.280
I'm assistant director
of operations at Langley,

18:37.363 --> 18:39.115
and I would like
to welcome you here

18:39.156 --> 18:40.950
to the CIA Special
Training Facility,

18:40.992 --> 18:44.244
affectionately known
as "the farm."

18:44.327 --> 18:45.370
Now let me introduce to you

18:45.453 --> 18:47.122
your senior instructor,
Mr. Walter Burke.

18:47.163 --> 18:48.373
Morning.

18:48.456 --> 18:49.833
Morning.

18:52.544 --> 18:54.546
So, why are you here?

18:54.629 --> 18:56.965
Why are you here?

18:59.092 --> 19:01.219
It ain't the money.

19:01.261 --> 19:05.556
A GS-15 pay grade officer,
yours truly --

19:05.598 --> 19:09.894
I rake in about, what,
75 grand a year?

19:09.935 --> 19:14.397
You can't buy
a decent sports car for that.

19:14.439 --> 19:16.065
It ain't sex.

19:16.149 --> 19:19.152
Hey, being here
won't get you laid.

19:19.235 --> 19:20.819
Oh, you're
a dental hygienist?

19:20.903 --> 19:25.282
I'm a member of the CIA,
Moscow Station chief.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.326
-Hello?!

19:27.409 --> 19:29.827
What about fame?

19:29.911 --> 19:33.080
Our failures are known.

19:33.164 --> 19:37.836
Our successes...are not.

19:37.878 --> 19:39.587
That's the company motto.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.256
You save the world,

19:42.340 --> 19:46.135
they send you to some
dusty basement at Langley,

19:46.177 --> 19:48.136
give you a little lemonade
and cookies,

19:48.178 --> 19:49.679
and show you your medal.

19:49.763 --> 19:51.306
You don't even get
to take it home.

19:51.389 --> 19:54.226
So it ain't money,
it ain't sex, it ain't fame.

19:54.309 --> 19:55.560
What is it?

19:55.644 --> 19:59.772
I say we are all here
in this room

19:59.855 --> 20:03.234
because we believe.

20:03.317 --> 20:07.111
We believe in good and evil,

20:07.153 --> 20:08.738
and we choose good.

20:08.821 --> 20:11.533
We believe in right and wrong,

20:11.616 --> 20:13.952
and we choose right.

20:14.035 --> 20:16.662
Our cause is just.

20:16.745 --> 20:21.833
Our enemies...everywhere.

20:21.918 --> 20:24.503
They're all around us.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.547
Some scary stuff out there.

20:26.630 --> 20:30.801
Which brings us here...
to the farm.

20:30.884 --> 20:35.221
You have all just stepped
through the looking glass.

20:35.263 --> 20:37.723
What you see, what you hear --

20:37.807 --> 20:41.185
nothing is what it seems.

20:42.894 --> 20:45.397
Indistinct conversations

20:48.608 --> 20:51.069
Mr. Burke?

20:51.152 --> 20:52.653
Hey.

20:52.736 --> 20:56.740
I was just, uh...I was hoping
maybe I could buy you a beer

20:56.824 --> 20:58.117
and we could talk.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.578
I have so many questions
about my dad.

21:00.661 --> 21:02.328
You're making a mistake, son.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.372
Let me remedy it.

21:04.414 --> 21:06.959
I was on semicongenial terms
with you

21:07.001 --> 21:09.503
during your recruitment
for that reason --

21:09.587 --> 21:10.795
I was recruiting you.

21:10.879 --> 21:12.338
I'm not your friend.

21:12.422 --> 21:14.674
I'm not your ally.

21:16.551 --> 21:20.262
I'm your instructor --
period.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.264
That enough talk?

21:33.858 --> 21:36.319
Good morning. It's 0600.

21:36.402 --> 21:39.946
All CTs report
to Common Area, 15 minutes.

21:41.698 --> 21:42.866
Is everybody ready?

21:46.912 --> 21:47.828
Morning.

21:47.912 --> 21:49.205
-Let's go.

21:49.288 --> 21:51.374
Let's go!

21:53.168 --> 21:55.587
Over the next few months,

21:55.670 --> 21:58.297
we're gonna teach you
how to deceive,

21:58.380 --> 22:02.384
role-play,
psychologically assess,

22:02.468 --> 22:05.221
sell, exploit.

22:05.262 --> 22:07.263
We're gonna hand you
the tools --

22:07.347 --> 22:08.765
the black arts.

22:08.848 --> 22:12.393
Not witchcraft --
trade craft...

22:12.477 --> 22:14.270
Ready! Fire!

22:15.979 --> 22:19.107
...disguise, surveil, detect.

22:19.191 --> 22:22.611
You will be able to kill
with a variety of weapons...

22:22.694 --> 22:24.737
-or none at all.

22:26.322 --> 22:29.659
You will night-parachute,
rappel from choppers,

22:29.700 --> 22:31.994
Iearn dry and wet demolition,

22:32.078 --> 22:35.664
Iearn tactical, high-speed
emergency driving.

22:35.747 --> 22:36.958
You will become...

22:37.041 --> 22:40.294
Bond -- James Bond.

22:40.378 --> 22:41.838
Thank you, Mr. Clayton.

22:41.921 --> 22:44.631
You're already role-playing.
That's good.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.299
You're ahead of all of us.

22:46.383 --> 22:49.636
Let's start with Clayton.
Why don't you take...Zack?

22:53.472 --> 22:54.849
Aah!

22:54.932 --> 22:56.433
Nice move.

22:56.517 --> 22:58.853
Where the hell did
you learn how to do that?

22:58.894 --> 23:01.604
Metro Dade Police Academy.

23:01.688 --> 23:03.690
Are you a senior
instructor at the farm?

23:03.773 --> 23:04.858
-Yes.

23:04.899 --> 23:06.151
True.

23:06.234 --> 23:08.153
Okay, if you look
at the screens,

23:08.236 --> 23:10.445
you'll see his pulse is even,

23:10.529 --> 23:12.739
respiration normal,

23:12.823 --> 23:15.367
pupils undilated --
signs of the truth.

23:15.450 --> 23:17.995
Come on, rough me up.
Let's go! Rough me up!

23:18.078 --> 23:20.371
Have you ever worn
women's clothing?

23:21.540 --> 23:22.791
Who said that?

23:22.833 --> 23:23.834
Yes.

23:23.876 --> 23:25.794
-True.

23:27.087 --> 23:30.673
Were you, uh,
ever stationed in Peru?

23:30.756 --> 23:32.008
Yes.

23:32.091 --> 23:33.801
True.

23:33.885 --> 23:36.470
Is your name Walter Burke?

23:36.554 --> 23:38.680
-No.

23:38.722 --> 23:40.390
True.

24:00.742 --> 24:02.076
Let's do it.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.495
Forth!

24:06.915 --> 24:08.416
Skid and holster!

24:13.630 --> 24:15.214
Remove your targets!

24:18.133 --> 24:19.343
Nintendo.

24:26.516 --> 24:31.229
These are paper ants --
microphone transmitters.

24:31.312 --> 24:33.688
They adhere equally well
to flesh or clothing,

24:33.772 --> 24:35.774
and they're biologically
manufactured,

24:35.857 --> 24:37.734
so as soon
as they become separated

24:37.818 --> 24:40.529
from their storage palate,
they begin to break down.

24:40.570 --> 24:44.907
After 48 hours,
this bug consumes itself.

24:44.990 --> 24:47.117
These are all live
surveillance devices --

24:47.201 --> 24:50.330
digitized,
miniaturized transceivers,

24:50.413 --> 24:52.164
audio and video.

24:52.248 --> 24:54.750
You can conceal them
throughout the bug house.

24:54.834 --> 24:59.004
Your objective is to gain entry,
install three bugs each,

24:59.088 --> 25:02.215
and exit the bug house
without getting caught.

25:02.298 --> 25:04.801
You will have eight minutes.

25:26.404 --> 25:29.489
What do we got here, Walter,
a bunch of D.S. & T. geeks,

25:29.573 --> 25:31.575
or we got some quality
NOC people?

25:31.616 --> 25:34.161
I don't know.

25:34.202 --> 25:36.330
Anybody get out
of the bug house lately?

25:36.414 --> 25:37.873
Not many.

25:41.001 --> 25:43.795
Doesn't look like
it's gonna happen tonight.

25:43.879 --> 25:46.797
Don't underestimate
my people, Dennis, please.

25:48.674 --> 25:51.469
Usually by now,
you've tagged a NOC.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.345
Must be one in this class.

25:53.429 --> 25:56.222
Well, maybe yes, maybe no.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.184
Who knows?

26:00.435 --> 26:02.020
The Shadow knows.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.483
I love this part.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.359
-Buenas noches, amigo,

26:09.401 --> 26:10.777
You've just been blanketed.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.987
That's two down.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.863
Oh, who's counting?

26:14.906 --> 26:17.533
Buenas noches, amigo,
You've just been blanketed.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.081
Attaboy.

26:27.084 --> 26:28.085
Aah!

26:28.169 --> 26:29.295
Ouch.

26:29.378 --> 26:30.546
Go!

26:30.630 --> 26:32.130
Go, go!

26:35.383 --> 26:36.968
Who was that?

26:44.350 --> 26:45.392
You okay?

26:45.476 --> 26:46.435
Yeah.

26:46.477 --> 26:48.771
Okay.

26:48.813 --> 26:51.564
Some of you will not survive
the farm.

26:51.648 --> 26:54.359
Some will be asked to leave.

26:54.442 --> 26:56.194
Some will quit.

26:56.236 --> 26:58.613
But those of you
who do graduate

26:58.696 --> 27:01.240
will be sent to work
out of Langley

27:01.281 --> 27:05.912
or embassies around the world
as official cover operatives.

27:05.954 --> 27:09.289
That is, spies
with diplomatic immunity.

27:09.373 --> 27:11.792
Now, every once in a while,

27:11.834 --> 27:16.630
someone is selected to be
a nonofficial cover operative,

27:16.713 --> 27:19.841
or N-O-C -- NOC.

27:19.924 --> 27:24.887
The NOC is the truest
practitioner of espionage --

27:24.971 --> 27:28.390
always out there,
always alone, unprotected.

27:28.473 --> 27:30.517
If you are caught,

27:30.600 --> 27:35.439
you will most likely be
tortured, shot, and/or hanged.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.190
And here's the best part --

27:38.232 --> 27:40.901
no one will ever hear about it.

27:40.943 --> 27:44.071
You will become a star
on a wall,

27:44.113 --> 27:47.031
a blank space in a book.

27:48.366 --> 27:51.954
Now, I can just feel
all you Alphas out there

27:51.996 --> 27:55.081
gunning for this position
as I speak.

27:55.165 --> 27:59.419
So remember,
everything is a test.

27:59.502 --> 28:01.838
Yeah? All right.

28:18.686 --> 28:21.439
All right,
I can afford 10 cents.

28:21.522 --> 28:23.315
Yo, I'm out.

28:23.398 --> 28:25.275
All right, I'll see you.

28:26.276 --> 28:29.613
Come on, you're gonna fold,
Ronnie. Just get it over with.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.989
-You're a Miami cop, right?
-Yeah.

28:32.031 --> 28:33.617
So why don't you
speak Spanish?

28:33.658 --> 28:34.618
I do.

28:34.659 --> 28:36.661
So where'd you learn Farsi --
Persian beat?

28:36.745 --> 28:38.705
Oh, that's funny.

28:38.747 --> 28:42.541
No, night school --
Florida Atlantic University --

28:42.625 --> 28:43.876
so I could get in here.

28:44.794 --> 28:45.920
Congratulations.

28:46.003 --> 28:47.171
Thanks.

28:47.254 --> 28:49.131
-Ronnie.
-I'm out.

28:49.173 --> 28:52.342
Well, looks like it's just me
and Sonny Crockett.

28:52.383 --> 28:53.968
Sonny Crockett --

28:54.052 --> 28:55.804
is that the black guy
or the white guy?

28:57.388 --> 28:59.181
What are the girls like
on South Beach?

28:59.223 --> 29:02.017
What do you want to do?

29:10.775 --> 29:12.026
All right.

29:12.068 --> 29:13.277
# Sonny, you're a boy #

29:13.361 --> 29:15.446
# Make a big noise
playing on the street #

29:15.488 --> 29:16.864
I'll see your bet
and raise you.

29:16.906 --> 29:19.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa --
$2 raises max, remember?

29:19.408 --> 29:21.828
Come on, we're not playing
by the rules here on the farm.

29:21.911 --> 29:23.830
Are we? Are we?

29:23.913 --> 29:25.331
Are we, Sonny?

29:25.373 --> 29:26.623
That's fine by me.

29:26.706 --> 29:28.500
Okay. So...

29:28.583 --> 29:30.794
Are my pupils dilated?

29:31.962 --> 29:33.964
I could be bluffing.

29:35.298 --> 29:38.259
Or it could just be dark
in here. What do you think?

29:38.300 --> 29:40.219
# Gonna be a big man
someday #

29:40.261 --> 29:42.430
# You got mud on your face #

29:46.558 --> 29:48.143
Okay, I'll give it to you.
I fold.

29:48.226 --> 29:51.396
-What did you have?
-Hey! That's not how we play.

29:51.479 --> 29:52.772
Your deal.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.523
Hey, man, good game.

29:54.606 --> 29:56.900
Well, well, well...

29:56.942 --> 29:59.236
Looks like boys' night in, huh?

29:59.319 --> 30:00.779
Kinda sad.

30:00.821 --> 30:03.198
I'm gonna change all that.

30:03.282 --> 30:06.660
Time for a field trip.
We got the van outside.

30:06.702 --> 30:09.079
We're all going for drinks
at the Blue Ridge.

30:21.257 --> 30:25.302
All right, your objective --
reach the parking lot

30:25.385 --> 30:28.013
with an asset who intends
to have sex with you.

30:28.096 --> 30:30.307
You want us to pick up a girl?

30:30.390 --> 30:33.392
Well, uh, five, actually --

30:33.476 --> 30:34.727
one each.

30:36.061 --> 30:37.646
# Change #

30:37.730 --> 30:40.231
# But be yourself, now #

30:45.987 --> 30:47.072
Hi.

30:47.156 --> 30:48.407
Hi.

30:48.449 --> 30:50.033
Here you go, Kitty.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.785
-Thanks, Barry.
- # Change #

30:51.868 --> 30:54.621
# But be yourself, now #

30:54.662 --> 30:56.331
# Change #

30:56.414 --> 30:58.041
# But be yourself, now #

30:58.123 --> 30:59.458
Not interested.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.043
Neither am l.

31:02.503 --> 31:03.879
How's that?

31:03.962 --> 31:07.715
Well, your personal interests
are of no concern to me.

31:07.757 --> 31:09.550
I just got out of the joint.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.762
And there's only one thing
I'm concerned with right now.

31:12.845 --> 31:15.181
And what would that be?

31:16.681 --> 31:18.058
What do you think?

31:18.141 --> 31:19.601
# Change #

31:19.643 --> 31:22.479
# But be yourself, now #

31:22.562 --> 31:24.106
# Change #

31:24.189 --> 31:26.732
# But be yourself, now #

31:29.693 --> 31:31.112
Sounds like fun.

31:33.782 --> 31:35.533
Excuse me a second.

31:40.746 --> 31:43.666
Hey...what's going on?
What are you doing here?

31:43.749 --> 31:45.667
What's it look like?

31:45.750 --> 31:47.252
Looks like you're drunk.

31:47.335 --> 31:49.337
Perceptive.

31:49.379 --> 31:51.047
Is everything okay?

31:51.131 --> 31:53.549
Yeah, everything's great.

31:53.632 --> 31:54.800
All right.

31:54.883 --> 31:56.844
See you tomorrow.

31:56.885 --> 31:58.220
# Ow, change #

31:58.303 --> 31:59.304
James...

31:59.388 --> 32:01.265
# But be yourself, now #

32:01.348 --> 32:04.016
-They cut me. I'm out.
- # Change #

32:04.100 --> 32:05.852
-You're kidding.
- # But be yourself, now #

32:05.893 --> 32:08.020
-I'm out of the program.
- # Change #

32:08.104 --> 32:09.731
You're serious --
did they say why?

32:09.814 --> 32:10.898
They didn't say anything.

32:10.982 --> 32:13.108
They just sit you down,
debrief you,

32:13.191 --> 32:16.278
and then stick you
in some shit-bag motel.

32:16.362 --> 32:17.530
# Change #

32:17.572 --> 32:18.948
# But be yourself, now #

32:19.031 --> 32:21.992
Sorry, all I can think about
is throwing up.

32:22.075 --> 32:23.160
You all right?

32:23.243 --> 32:25.871
Yeah, I think I had
too much tequila.

32:27.038 --> 32:29.249
You know,
it's just that you and l

32:29.332 --> 32:32.251
finally have
this chemistry moment,

32:32.334 --> 32:35.171
you know, and I even have
a motel room

32:35.254 --> 32:36.422
where we could go back

32:36.505 --> 32:38.674
and have completely
justifiable comfort sex,

32:38.716 --> 32:40.884
but all I can think about
is not throwing up.

32:42.844 --> 32:46.347
The -- the room's spinning,
right?

32:46.431 --> 32:47.849
Yeah, like a top.

32:49.016 --> 32:51.268
You should go home.
I'll call you a cab.

32:51.351 --> 32:53.479
Come on. Come here.

32:55.814 --> 32:58.649
Will you settle for taking
me home and tucking me in?

32:58.733 --> 32:59.984
I wish.

33:04.448 --> 33:06.991
Blue Ridge Bar, yeah.

33:07.075 --> 33:09.452
10 minutes? Thank you.

33:09.535 --> 33:11.120
Cab will be here in 10.

33:11.204 --> 33:12.997
-Okay.
-Okay.

33:13.081 --> 33:14.582
Come on, wait with me
outside, okay?

33:14.665 --> 33:15.583
I...

33:15.666 --> 33:16.666
Come on.

33:19.836 --> 33:21.713
Layla, let's wait inside.
It's cold.

33:21.755 --> 33:23.298
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Just wait.

33:23.381 --> 33:25.966
Come on.
I want to kiss you.

33:26.050 --> 33:27.176
Tell me about it.

33:27.259 --> 33:28.302
Thank you.

33:28.386 --> 33:29.470
For what?

33:30.638 --> 33:33.015
Op completed.

33:38.853 --> 33:41.398
My op was to stop you
from completing yours.

33:43.316 --> 33:45.359
-Who said my op was complete?

33:45.401 --> 33:47.237
-Lighten up, man.
-It's just an op.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.072
Just doing her job,
that's it.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.324
God, I hate this guy.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.704
You did your job. Good.

33:59.331 --> 34:01.625
Are you a citizen
of the United States?

34:01.708 --> 34:02.875
Yes.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.252
True.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.380
Are you in any way
affiliated with the CIA?

34:07.422 --> 34:08.380
No.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.882
-It's false.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.925
All right, let's break up
this dance team.

34:12.007 --> 34:16.679
Clayton, switch places
with, uh, Zack here.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.308
All right, we all know,
I believe,

34:21.391 --> 34:25.646
what a lie is when we see it.

34:25.730 --> 34:31.402
But a good interrogator
can also soften a subject --

34:31.485 --> 34:34.864
you know, uh,
knock them off-balance,

34:34.947 --> 34:36.782
make them vulnerable.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.867
Never know what you might get.

34:38.949 --> 34:42.579
So...fire at will.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.331
Is your name Layla Moore?

34:46.416 --> 34:48.417
-Yes.

34:49.501 --> 34:50.878
True.

34:52.129 --> 34:53.922
Last night at the bar,

34:54.005 --> 34:56.884
you said we had
chemistry together.

34:56.966 --> 34:58.259
Do we?

34:58.342 --> 34:59.469
What?

34:59.552 --> 35:01.512
His interrogation.
Answer the man.

35:01.554 --> 35:03.806
Simple question --
yes or no?

35:03.890 --> 35:06.933
I was undercover legend.
It was part of the op.

35:08.810 --> 35:10.270
-True.

35:11.521 --> 35:13.815
You said you wanted to go home
and have comfort sex.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.611
Did you?

35:17.652 --> 35:20.030
You're abusing this exercise.

35:20.072 --> 35:22.532
Did you want to have sex with me
last night -- yes or no?

35:25.493 --> 35:26.660
No.

35:41.341 --> 35:44.009
Would you do anything
to become a CIA officer?

35:46.220 --> 35:47.221
Anything?

35:51.725 --> 35:53.309
No.

36:03.569 --> 36:04.487
Layla!

36:04.570 --> 36:05.655
Stay away from me.

36:05.738 --> 36:06.823
Can I talk to you?

36:06.906 --> 36:08.074
There are limits, James.

36:08.157 --> 36:10.201
You want to suck up to Burke,
do it on your own.

36:10.284 --> 36:11.410
This isn't about Burke.

36:12.661 --> 36:14.621
You won, okay?
You got even.

36:14.705 --> 36:15.997
How does it feel?

36:16.081 --> 36:17.582
Huh?

36:17.666 --> 36:19.376
God!

36:29.592 --> 36:31.428
I pity the fool.

36:32.679 --> 36:33.763
Anyone I know?

36:33.847 --> 36:35.014
Maybe.

36:36.182 --> 36:38.142
Let it go.

36:38.183 --> 36:40.686
You first.

36:44.774 --> 36:46.860
I don't know how I --

36:48.694 --> 36:50.571
I don't belong here.

36:50.612 --> 36:53.198
Come on --
meant to do this, son.

36:53.282 --> 36:56.076
You know more about me
than I do?

36:56.160 --> 37:00.246
Hey, this bag knows more
about you than you do, James.

37:00.329 --> 37:01.664
It's in you.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.460
It's in your blood.

37:05.501 --> 37:06.460
Aah!

37:06.501 --> 37:09.004
Mama Land's crabs

37:09.087 --> 37:11.506
from the Circle's fourteenth
in Saigon --

37:11.590 --> 37:13.133
best crabs in the world.

37:13.216 --> 37:16.218
This place -- second-best.

37:20.181 --> 37:23.309
Okay, why don't you
just go ahead?

37:24.476 --> 37:26.394
Go ahead and ask me.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.982
Did you know him?

37:31.317 --> 37:32.735
No.

37:34.235 --> 37:36.488
I met him once.

37:36.571 --> 37:39.991
Falklands...around '89.

37:42.826 --> 37:45.204
What was he --
what was he doing there?

37:45.287 --> 37:47.998
Think, son.
I can't tell you specifics.

37:48.082 --> 37:49.458
I just can't.

37:49.500 --> 37:53.461
I can't even confirm
his mission.

37:53.544 --> 37:54.962
I can't.

37:56.255 --> 37:57.882
He used to tell me stories.

37:57.965 --> 38:00.051
He'd say, uh...

38:00.134 --> 38:03.345
when they'd hit one,
the desert would rain oil.

38:03.428 --> 38:06.098
That's what he did, James.
He told stories.

38:06.139 --> 38:07.099
Yeah.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.308
And he lied.

38:10.935 --> 38:13.522
That doesn't mean
he didn't love you.

38:14.773 --> 38:16.358
What was he, really?

38:16.441 --> 38:18.485
What did he do?

38:19.777 --> 38:22.822
You gotta come off it, kid.
You really do.

38:22.905 --> 38:25.658
Because you keep looking back,

38:25.700 --> 38:28.410
you're gonna miss
your whole life.

38:28.493 --> 38:32.288
It's a mystery
you cannot solve.

38:32.372 --> 38:34.916
Who is --
who is Edward Clayton?

38:34.999 --> 38:39.086
Well, among many things,
he was James Clayton's father.

38:39.169 --> 38:41.046
Also, he was someone else.

38:49.595 --> 38:53.975
He was a spook, James...
just like me.

38:54.058 --> 38:55.809
Just like you.

38:55.892 --> 38:57.936
Don't look now.

38:58.020 --> 39:00.898
By the bar --
we're being followed.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.066
You serious?

39:02.150 --> 39:04.027
Yeah.

39:04.110 --> 39:06.820
Sometimes these guys
just like to loiter around,

39:06.903 --> 39:09.614
see if they can gain intel
on the farm.

39:09.698 --> 39:11.616
I'll get someone on it.

39:35.429 --> 39:36.680
Hey.

39:37.723 --> 39:38.807
Looking good.

39:38.891 --> 39:40.934
Yeah, but can I do it
blindfolded

39:40.976 --> 39:42.393
jumping out of a plane?

39:42.435 --> 39:44.521
I bet you can.

39:44.605 --> 39:46.023
Thanks.

39:46.065 --> 39:48.525
It's probably not
the best time to apologize.

39:48.609 --> 39:50.611
You don't have to apologize.

39:52.278 --> 39:54.238
Can l?

39:54.280 --> 39:55.657
Sure.

40:03.747 --> 40:07.584
Here's how
I'm gonna look at it.

40:07.668 --> 40:11.045
We learned a lot
about each other.

40:11.087 --> 40:12.963
Yeah, the hard way.

40:13.005 --> 40:17.009
Yeah, the hard way,
but still...at least we know.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.636
Okay.

40:19.719 --> 40:23.682
So, now...
we're ahead of the game.

40:23.765 --> 40:25.183
Is that it?

40:25.266 --> 40:26.643
Exactly.

40:27.852 --> 40:29.270
So what do we do?

40:29.354 --> 40:31.106
Nothing.

40:31.189 --> 40:33.108
Not here.

40:33.149 --> 40:34.567
Not now.

40:34.651 --> 40:36.444
No, not now.

40:40.239 --> 40:44.410
One year from now,
where are you?

40:44.493 --> 40:47.328
Probably waitressing
at Denny's.

40:47.370 --> 40:50.957
Mm-hmm...yeah.

40:51.040 --> 40:55.752
When I was a kid, my father
would get out the atlas...

40:57.129 --> 41:00.090
Okay, today we practice
the art of surveillance.

41:00.173 --> 41:01.591
Remember your training.

41:01.675 --> 41:04.177
The person being followed
is the...

41:04.261 --> 41:05.469
Rabbit.

41:05.511 --> 41:07.763
Rabbit. The person doing
the following is the...

41:07.847 --> 41:09.098
-Eye.
-Eye.

41:09.181 --> 41:12.978
Behind the eye is the rest
of the surveillance team,

41:13.061 --> 41:16.480
who cannot see the rabbit
but follow the eye.

41:16.522 --> 41:18.691
As the rabbit travels,

41:18.774 --> 41:22.486
the teammates will rotate
themselves into the eye position

41:22.570 --> 41:25.655
so that the rabbit doesn't
realize he's being followed.

41:25.739 --> 41:28.033
Rabbit, don't forget,
your choke points

41:28.116 --> 41:30.410
help you to identify
who's on your tail.

41:30.493 --> 41:32.328
And keep those cellphones off.

41:32.411 --> 41:35.831
In the field,
they act like homing devices.

41:35.873 --> 41:38.208
All right?
What do we do?

41:38.292 --> 41:41.461
lmprovise, modify,
adapt, overcome.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.171
Let's go to work!

41:44.213 --> 41:45.965
Turn your cellphone off?

41:46.049 --> 41:47.467
Didn't bring it.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.302
Good.

41:49.344 --> 41:52.929
Hey...this looks like
a good choke point.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.139
You're right.

42:00.145 --> 42:02.064
Let's hide here
and wait, okay?

42:02.147 --> 42:03.440
Sure.

42:08.278 --> 42:10.029
-James! James!
-Layla!

42:11.489 --> 42:13.157
No!

42:13.199 --> 42:14.533
James!

42:14.617 --> 42:17.662
-Let go of me!

42:51.192 --> 42:54.903
I am a Diplomatic Corps trainee.

42:54.945 --> 42:57.322
We know that you work
for the CIA.

42:58.407 --> 42:59.908
The CIA.

42:59.992 --> 43:02.244
I don't work for the CIA.

43:02.327 --> 43:03.911
I think you do.

44:02.214 --> 44:04.133
Enjoy your cold shower.

44:25.654 --> 44:27.446
Hungry, Jimmy?

44:31.241 --> 44:33.577
You guys make the best stuff.

44:34.578 --> 44:36.537
You realize that no country
with a McDonald's

44:36.579 --> 44:39.374
has ever attacked
the United States?

44:39.457 --> 44:41.334
They teach you that at the farm?

44:41.376 --> 44:44.128
I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:45.379 --> 44:47.464
You think this is
a game, James?

44:49.091 --> 44:51.718
I think...it's a test.

44:52.803 --> 44:53.762
No.

44:53.845 --> 44:55.931
I'm sorry, my friend.

44:56.014 --> 44:57.975
This is no test.

44:58.058 --> 45:00.143
Everything is a test!

45:12.612 --> 45:14.948
Everything is a test.

45:23.414 --> 45:25.332
Good morning, James.

45:45.977 --> 45:48.563
What are the names
of your instructors?

45:50.522 --> 45:51.607
Okay.

45:51.690 --> 45:53.317
Okay.

45:55.027 --> 45:57.154
John is the wise guy.

45:58.654 --> 46:00.364
Paul's the cute one.

46:00.448 --> 46:03.242
-George is pretty quiet.

46:03.284 --> 46:04.744
And this new kid --

46:04.827 --> 46:07.288
I can't remember his name.

46:07.371 --> 46:08.747
Oh.

46:08.872 --> 46:11.499
Now I know why
she was begging for you.

46:11.583 --> 46:13.251
You're funny.

46:14.586 --> 46:17.296
Sorry if these stink.

46:17.338 --> 46:19.256
She pissed herself.

46:31.852 --> 46:34.229
Oh, Layla.

46:34.271 --> 46:35.855
Layla?

46:38.149 --> 46:41.235
Burke! You want a name?!

46:41.277 --> 46:44.279
Burke! Burke!

47:20.313 --> 47:22.648
I wanted you to see this.

47:26.568 --> 47:30.363
I wanted you to see
what happens to someone...

47:30.446 --> 47:35.034
you know...
someone you care about...

47:35.118 --> 47:36.953
so you won't forget.

47:36.995 --> 47:42.207
What you should learn
from this exercise --

47:42.249 --> 47:45.794
and learn it well --

47:45.877 --> 47:50.172
rule number one --

47:50.256 --> 47:55.721
do...not...get...caught.

48:45.098 --> 48:48.185
Hey, buddy, you are
sweating your ass off.

48:48.226 --> 48:49.686
I know. It's hot.

48:49.770 --> 48:54.065
No -- I mean, you're really
sweating from the ass.

48:57.902 --> 48:59.236
I'm so ashamed.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.738
Don't worry, pal.

49:00.821 --> 49:04.074
You just need
a little help back there.

49:04.157 --> 49:05.951
-This is my secret.

49:06.034 --> 49:07.619
Manpons?

49:07.702 --> 49:09.704
It's like a cool spring breeze

49:09.788 --> 49:11.705
blowing through
your ass cheeks.

49:11.789 --> 49:14.792
At this point,
I'll try anything.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.544
Hello, this is Bill Rudolph
at Dell.

49:17.628 --> 49:20.256
I'm not in right now, but please
leave a message at the beep.

49:20.339 --> 49:22.632
I'll return your call as soon
as possible. Thank you.

49:23.717 --> 49:25.886
Hey, Bill Rudolph,
thank you for calling me back.

49:25.970 --> 49:28.097
It's James Douglas Clayton.

49:28.180 --> 49:32.350
We met at M.I.T. in Boston
at -- we -- Sp@rtacus --

49:32.433 --> 49:34.352
Sp@rtacus --

49:34.435 --> 49:38.106
and I was
with my family for a while,

49:38.147 --> 49:42.359
but now I'm back, and I'm ready
to raise the bar with Sp@rtacus,

49:42.442 --> 49:44.570
'cause we can raise the bar
with Sp@rtacus

49:44.653 --> 49:46.113
and change things.

49:46.196 --> 49:47.947
Will you call me...

50:10.427 --> 50:11.595
Nice hit.

50:11.636 --> 50:12.971
What the --

50:13.054 --> 50:14.931
You mind?

50:14.973 --> 50:17.016
My throat.

50:17.099 --> 50:19.894
Let go. Now.

50:19.977 --> 50:21.312
Now.

50:26.107 --> 50:27.650
What --

50:33.489 --> 50:35.866
I see you're living good.

50:38.076 --> 50:41.079
Get some clothes on.
We'll take a drive.

50:41.163 --> 50:42.164
A drive?

50:42.247 --> 50:44.498
Yeah. I'll wait outside.

50:53.758 --> 50:56.218
That booze is coming out
of your bones.

50:56.302 --> 50:58.596
What am I doing here?

50:58.679 --> 51:00.890
I'm done, remember?
I'm out.

51:00.973 --> 51:03.016
I don't have to play
your stupid games.

51:03.099 --> 51:05.352
Oh, but you will, James.

51:05.393 --> 51:09.397
You will play because
your particular engine --

51:09.481 --> 51:14.151
what drives you, moves you,
motivates you --

51:14.235 --> 51:15.736
desire to please...

51:17.071 --> 51:19.114
Me.

51:19.198 --> 51:21.366
-All right, pull over.

51:21.449 --> 51:23.159
Pull over the goddamn car!

51:23.243 --> 51:26.287
-All right! Go ahead, get out.

51:26.371 --> 51:29.539
You lasted longer
on your interrogation exercise

51:29.581 --> 51:32.251
than any CT has
in the last 15 years.

51:32.334 --> 51:33.418
I broke!

51:33.502 --> 51:35.754
Everybody breaks!
That's the point!

51:35.796 --> 51:38.340
Damn thing doesn't stop
till you break.

51:38.423 --> 51:39.508
Then why did I wash out?

51:39.591 --> 51:42.219
You didn't!
That's why I'm here.

51:42.302 --> 51:44.304
You're the NOC, James.

51:45.305 --> 51:46.265
Bullshit.

51:46.306 --> 51:48.891
The washout was faked.

51:48.975 --> 51:50.476
You're the NOC.

51:50.560 --> 51:53.104
I told you I was
a scary judge of talent.

51:55.690 --> 51:57.107
Why me?

51:58.525 --> 52:00.026
Get in here.

52:03.321 --> 52:04.906
I don't believe this.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.368
More farm mind games.

52:09.410 --> 52:11.203
Nothing is what it seems,
na na na.

52:11.287 --> 52:13.247
No, no, no, no.
School's out.

52:13.289 --> 52:16.958
Open that, uh,
glove compartment.

52:17.041 --> 52:18.334
Go ahead.

52:22.798 --> 52:24.674
Find out why you.

52:37.185 --> 52:38.937
That's why you.

52:39.021 --> 52:40.147
Layla? Wh--

52:40.230 --> 52:42.190
Layla Moore --

52:42.232 --> 52:45.109
raised from the age of 3
by Tom and Susan Moore

52:45.192 --> 52:47.111
of Worcester, Mass.

52:47.194 --> 52:50.823
However, her real last name
isn't Moore -- it's Nasari.

52:50.865 --> 52:53.658
Birth mother is Algerian,
father's French.

52:53.742 --> 52:55.202
It's all there --

52:55.285 --> 53:00.749
secret bank accounts,
phony records, fake passports.

53:00.831 --> 53:02.791
Layla's a sleeper.

53:02.875 --> 53:05.586
She's a mole, James.

53:08.548 --> 53:10.341
I don't believe it.
This is crazy.

53:10.424 --> 53:12.593
How the hell
did she get into the farm --

53:12.676 --> 53:14.220
We wanted her in.

53:14.261 --> 53:17.139
We want her to burrow in
as deep as she can,

53:17.181 --> 53:19.641
because then, she'll lead us
to her handlers.

53:19.724 --> 53:21.267
We know exactly
what she wants.

53:21.351 --> 53:24.938
It's who she's giving it to --
that's what we need to know.

53:24.979 --> 53:27.982
Layla's gonna take us
right up the food chain.

53:28.066 --> 53:29.691
I won't do it.

53:29.775 --> 53:31.109
You won't do it?

53:31.193 --> 53:34.321
James...

53:34.404 --> 53:37.949
why do you think I came
to Cambridge to recruit you?

53:38.032 --> 53:40.117
Nobody's chasing CTs anymore.

53:40.201 --> 53:42.453
I mean, our applications
are through the roof.

53:42.537 --> 53:45.957
We needed you...James.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.415
No accidents.

53:47.457 --> 53:49.876
You and Layla were matched.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.712
She's an orphan.

53:51.796 --> 53:54.048
You're a young man
searching for a father.

53:54.131 --> 53:56.925
You're both highly motivated,
you're both highly independent.

53:57.008 --> 53:59.511
You even look good together.

54:01.221 --> 54:03.848
We paired you at the farm, son.

54:03.932 --> 54:06.308
We paired you, remember?

54:06.350 --> 54:08.394
The Blue Ridge barhop?

54:08.477 --> 54:10.938
The lie detector session?

54:11.021 --> 54:13.065
The choke point test?

54:13.148 --> 54:15.692
And it worked, didn't it?

54:15.775 --> 54:17.610
She trusts you.

54:17.694 --> 54:19.112
Loves you, maybe.

54:19.195 --> 54:22.532
And you're gonna take
that trust and that love

54:22.574 --> 54:25.284
and you're gonna use it to
find out who she's working for.

54:29.788 --> 54:31.248
James...

54:33.875 --> 54:37.421
My first posting was
in ltaly -- Trieste.

54:37.504 --> 54:40.632
A physics conference
met there every summer.

54:40.716 --> 54:44.468
So I meet this local girl --
beautiful, sweet.

54:44.552 --> 54:48.180
She's working for the Russian
group as a secretary.

54:48.264 --> 54:51.808
Anyway, I did my job.
I worked her. I turned her.

54:51.892 --> 54:54.394
Pretty soon, she's giving me
everything, you know --

54:54.477 --> 54:57.397
I mean,
really high-grade stuff --

54:57.480 --> 55:00.441
and, uh, I'm a hero.

55:00.524 --> 55:03.694
But I'm still a kid, two years,
fresh out of Ocala, Florida.

55:03.777 --> 55:06.530
I got this perfect ltalian girl,
and she's crazy for me,

55:06.572 --> 55:08.073
and we're falling in love.

55:08.157 --> 55:11.868
I knew the Russians were
getting close to her.

55:11.951 --> 55:14.913
I knew she was
in jeopardy, but...

55:14.996 --> 55:16.789
material was valuable.

55:18.041 --> 55:19.875
I could've warned her.

55:21.961 --> 55:23.922
I could've saved her.

55:25.298 --> 55:28.008
But the information
was more important.

55:29.343 --> 55:31.053
You understand?

55:31.136 --> 55:35.641
The information was more
important than she was...

55:35.724 --> 55:38.809
more important than I was.

55:42.522 --> 55:44.690
It is what we do.

55:49.986 --> 55:51.446
I need to think about it.

55:51.488 --> 55:53.990
Oh, come on.
"Think about it."

55:55.158 --> 55:57.409
You got 24 hours.

56:15.260 --> 56:16.219
Burke here.

56:16.261 --> 56:18.054
Okay.

56:18.054 --> 56:19.264
I'll do it.

56:21.349 --> 56:22.684
Iwo Jima Memorial --

56:22.767 --> 56:26.270
this is where you tell me
about duty and sacrifice?

56:26.353 --> 56:28.313
No, this is where I have
my breakfast burrito.

56:32.191 --> 56:34.569
Volente Brothers.

56:34.652 --> 56:36.863
They're the best.

56:36.946 --> 56:37.864
There you go.

56:37.947 --> 56:39.949
-Gracias,
-Thank you.

56:39.991 --> 56:43.159
Try it. It's heaven.

56:45.245 --> 56:46.371
So, what is she after?

56:46.454 --> 56:49.374
You ever read Kurt Vonnegut?

56:49.457 --> 56:50.418
Yeah.

56:50.459 --> 56:52.961
-You read "Cat's Cradle"?
-Nah.

56:53.044 --> 56:57.382
Well, in that book,
the world ends

56:57.465 --> 57:01.051
because in a chip of ice,
a molecule is discovered

57:01.093 --> 57:05.973
that can turn all the water
it touches into ice.

57:06.056 --> 57:08.434
Since all water
is interconnected --

57:08.517 --> 57:11.477
that is, pond to stream,
stream to river,

57:11.561 --> 57:14.314
river to lake,
lake to ocean --

57:14.397 --> 57:17.025
the entire world freezes
and dies,

57:17.108 --> 57:22.487
and that seed molecule
is called lce 9.

57:22.529 --> 57:24.448
Ice 9.

57:24.489 --> 57:27.950
Langley has invented
a computer virus

57:28.034 --> 57:32.163
that can plug into
any electrical receptacle --

57:32.246 --> 57:36.084
that is, the wall outlet
in your apartment --

57:36.168 --> 57:37.752
using existing wiring

57:37.835 --> 57:40.463
to spread right through
the entire national grid.

57:40.546 --> 57:43.007
No firewalls, no protection.

57:43.090 --> 57:44.217
Jesus.

57:44.300 --> 57:45.301
That's it.

57:46.384 --> 57:47.886
Our national defense,

57:47.969 --> 57:51.181
our national survival
depends on electronics.

57:51.264 --> 57:52.766
You take that away...

57:52.849 --> 57:55.559
we're back in the Stone Age
with our enemies.

57:57.561 --> 57:59.605
This was good.

57:59.688 --> 58:01.232
Can I make it?

58:03.776 --> 58:05.944
Oh! So close.

58:11.407 --> 58:13.492
You're going to Langley.

58:14.868 --> 58:19.707
Your cover story is that
you washed out of the farm,

58:19.791 --> 58:21.125
but we love you --

58:21.167 --> 58:23.126
you're a good boy,
a patriot --

58:23.210 --> 58:26.922
so we got you a low-level,
low-security gig...

58:26.964 --> 58:31.051
but your real assignment
is to get close to Layla

58:31.134 --> 58:33.594
and to stay close to her.

58:33.678 --> 58:36.556
Find out who she's talking to.

59:00.994 --> 59:02.745
Layla requested Cryptography,

59:02.829 --> 59:03.789
so we gave it to her.

59:03.873 --> 59:06.542
She's working at the Directorate
of Science and Technology

59:06.625 --> 59:07.543
in Langley.

59:07.626 --> 59:09.544
Well, if she's
a new employee in Langley,

59:09.627 --> 59:11.379
isn't surveillance on her
24/7?

59:11.462 --> 59:13.381
They've got to find out
what she's up to.

59:13.464 --> 59:16.050
Langley's security is
all about entry and exit --

59:16.134 --> 59:17.218
going in, going out.

59:17.302 --> 59:18.886
-You are scoped, taped...
-Morning.

59:18.927 --> 59:20.888
...tagged like no other
place on Earth,

59:20.929 --> 59:22.556
but once you're on the inside,

59:22.598 --> 59:24.475
the assumption is
you belong there.

59:24.558 --> 59:26.393
-Langley's too big to watch.

59:26.435 --> 59:28.311
We're a city, and as such,

59:28.394 --> 59:30.855
we are vulnerable
to betrayal from within,

59:30.938 --> 59:32.690
always have been --
Ames, Nickelson, Howard.

59:32.773 --> 59:34.233
So what have you got me doing?

59:34.275 --> 59:35.443
We've given you

59:35.526 --> 59:37.527
a low-level data-processing
position

59:37.611 --> 59:39.779
in the information
management center --

59:39.863 --> 59:42.657
not uncommon for CTs
who don't graduate the farm.

59:42.699 --> 59:43.700
You'll love it.

59:43.742 --> 59:45.868
-Mr. Clayton?
-Hey.

59:45.951 --> 59:47.912
-Rob Stevens, your supervisor.
-Nice to meet you.

59:47.953 --> 59:49.623
-Welcome to CIA.
-Thank you.

59:53.210 --> 59:55.878
The building we're going into
is totally secure.

59:55.961 --> 59:58.756
No radio-wave transmissions
in or out.

59:58.839 --> 01:00:02.301
Electronic devices --
computers, telephones --

01:00:02.384 --> 01:00:04.594
even your voice
create vibrations

01:00:04.636 --> 01:00:06.596
that a sophisticated laser
pointer in the building

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:08.890
-can read and translate.

01:00:12.935 --> 01:00:15.646
I'll tell you, this card won't
get you into the good stuff,

01:00:15.729 --> 01:00:18.232
but that little logo
definitely gets you laid.

01:00:18.273 --> 01:00:20.859
Republican girls -- hot.

01:00:22.235 --> 01:00:23.903
Here we go. This is you.

01:00:25.988 --> 01:00:28.491
The manual's
pretty self-explanatory.

01:00:28.574 --> 01:00:31.326
Log in as much data as you can
without getting carpal tunnel.

01:00:31.368 --> 01:00:32.744
Any questions, I'm 1229.

01:00:32.786 --> 01:00:33.746
Thank you.

01:00:43.255 --> 01:00:44.381
Thank you.

01:00:44.464 --> 01:00:46.550
I'll see you over there.

01:00:47.926 --> 01:00:49.010
James.

01:00:49.094 --> 01:00:51.095
Layla. Hey.

01:00:51.178 --> 01:00:54.014
What ar--
oh, you're here?

01:00:54.098 --> 01:00:55.683
Yep. Data entry.

01:00:55.766 --> 01:00:57.601
Not exactly
what I'd imagined, but...

01:00:58.685 --> 01:01:01.813
After you left...
we missed you at the farm.

01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:03.982
Yeah.

01:01:04.065 --> 01:01:06.109
Look, I'm late, so...

01:01:06.192 --> 01:01:08.360
Oh, right. Okay.

01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:10.404
It's good to see you.

01:01:10.445 --> 01:01:12.573
Yeah. You too.

01:01:12.656 --> 01:01:13.824
Take care.

01:01:18.912 --> 01:01:20.706
-Hi, Frank.
-Hey, how's it going?

01:01:20.747 --> 01:01:21.748
Good.

01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:27.962
Take care.

01:01:28.045 --> 01:01:29.755
-Thanks. See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

01:02:08.082 --> 01:02:09.793
Hey, Joey. Cappuccino.

01:02:09.876 --> 01:02:10.877
Sure.

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:16.590
James.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.591
Hi.

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:18.842
Hey. Hey.

01:02:18.926 --> 01:02:21.385
I'm not stalking you, I swear.
I come here all the time.

01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:22.428
How you doing?

01:02:22.512 --> 01:02:24.514
Good. You mind?

01:02:24.597 --> 01:02:26.599
No, of course not.

01:02:26.682 --> 01:02:27.683
Thanks.

01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:29.060
Sure.

01:02:30.228 --> 01:02:32.395
What are you reading?

01:02:33.647 --> 01:02:35.232
-Good?
-Weird.

01:02:35.315 --> 01:02:36.358
Here you go.

01:02:36.441 --> 01:02:37.567
Thanks.

01:02:40.486 --> 01:02:41.612
So...

01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:42.988
Hmm?

01:02:43.072 --> 01:02:44.949
I'm in Science and Tech.

01:02:45.032 --> 01:02:46.909
-Science and Tech?
-Yeah.

01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:48.245
Not in the field?

01:02:48.328 --> 01:02:50.621
The field is what you said
you always wanted.

01:02:50.704 --> 01:02:53.249
Yeah, well...

01:02:53.332 --> 01:02:55.960
found out it wasn't.

01:02:59.003 --> 01:03:01.047
It's good to see you.

01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:03.383
You too.

01:03:10.097 --> 01:03:11.431
So, where you living?

01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:13.767
The company found me
an apartment in Georgetown.

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:15.018
What about you?

01:03:15.102 --> 01:03:17.895
Uh, I'm over in Adams Morgan.

01:03:17.937 --> 01:03:19.897
When did you move down
from Boston?

01:03:19.939 --> 01:03:22.275
A week ago.
I drove down.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:39.791
Thanks.

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.251
You're welcome.

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:53.219
See you soon.

01:03:53.303 --> 01:03:55.388
Yeah. You want a ride?

01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:57.682
-Nah, I got my truck.
-Okay.

01:03:57.766 --> 01:03:59.934
-All right. See you.
-Good night.

01:03:59.976 --> 01:04:00.977
Good night.

01:04:56.528 --> 01:04:59.488
Okay, you re-established contact.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:01.658
Now get into her office,

01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:03.993
see if she's accessed
the program.

01:05:04.077 --> 01:05:07.329
If she's got lce 9,
what's she doing with it?

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:08.831
She can't copy it.

01:05:08.914 --> 01:05:11.208
Langley computers
don't have disk drives

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:12.543
for exactly this reason,

01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:14.253
and she can't print it out.

01:05:14.336 --> 01:05:15.837
There are no printers.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.630
Company policy.

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:21.592
D.S. & T. is a secure area.
You're gonna need clearance.

01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:23.678
I'll handle that.

01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:12.638
Thank you, sir.

01:06:25.358 --> 01:06:27.360
-Morning.
-Good morning.

01:06:32.866 --> 01:06:35.869
James...a bunch of us are going
over to Senor Pepe's.

01:06:35.952 --> 01:06:38.246
-Margarita Monday.
-Republican interns, huh?

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.289
Vaminos, muchachos,

01:06:45.586 --> 01:06:48.463
Hi, this is Layla Moore.
I'm in a meeting until 4:30.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:51.341
You can call me then or leave me
a message after the t--

01:07:27.207 --> 01:07:28.917
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:55.497
Mike? Black, two sugars.
Right?

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.580
Thanks.

01:08:57.997 --> 01:08:58.957
Hey.

01:08:58.999 --> 01:09:00.667
-Oh, Sharon...
-Yeah?

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:03.712
I still haven't gotten
those files I asked about.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:07.548
It's all right.
I'll look for them.

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:09.425
-How was the date?
-lt was great.

01:09:09.466 --> 01:09:12.136
I just don't know where to go,
and -- I don't know...

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.763
You know, there's
this ltalian restaurant

01:09:14.845 --> 01:09:17.640
down in Georgetown,
and it's authentic.

01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:29.736
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:31.571
You dropped these in my car.

01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:34.073
Must've just slipped
out of your hand.

01:09:34.156 --> 01:09:35.116
Nah.

01:09:35.157 --> 01:09:37.368
I dropped them on purpose.

01:09:37.451 --> 01:09:39.787
You trying to manipulate me?

01:09:40.996 --> 01:09:42.788
Maybe.

01:09:44.624 --> 01:09:46.251
It's working.

01:09:55.634 --> 01:09:57.594
-Frank.
-Hey.

01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:07.854
-Good night, Layla.
-Good night.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.522
Layla. Wait up.

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:13.316
Here you go.

01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:25.454
Allow me, madame.

01:10:25.537 --> 01:10:26.496
Thank you.

01:10:26.538 --> 01:10:28.164
You're welcome.

01:10:28.247 --> 01:10:29.498
Where's your car?

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.333
Red pickup, over there.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.626
Oh, nice. New?

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:34.670
Newish.
This your little baby?

01:10:34.712 --> 01:10:36.380
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:10:36.422 --> 01:10:38.173
-Night.
-See you tomorrow.

01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:42.093
Hey, James?

01:10:42.177 --> 01:10:43.219
Yeah?

01:10:45.221 --> 01:10:46.972
I want to show you something.

01:10:51.226 --> 01:10:54.938
That camera takes 30 seconds
to scan the room.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.859
That one takes another
30 seconds on the opposite arc.

01:10:58.942 --> 01:11:01.737
So if you stand right here,

01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:03.489
you're ready to waltz
one step,

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:05.531
you could have 40 seconds
of complete privacy

01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:08.034
where the cameras
won't see you.

01:11:08.117 --> 01:11:11.037
19, 18, 1 7 --

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.038
Okay.

01:11:12.121 --> 01:11:13.206
Closer.

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:16.666
Here?

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:17.876
There.

01:11:17.959 --> 01:11:20.796
Now we're completely private.

01:11:20.879 --> 01:11:22.130
10, 9...

01:11:22.214 --> 01:11:24.840
What were you thinking about
when you figured this out?

01:11:24.924 --> 01:11:26.926
You.

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.974
3, 2, 1, waltz.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:38.645
We have 20 more seconds.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:40.688
That's not enough time.

01:12:04.335 --> 01:12:05.837
Layla?

01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:46.775
Sorry it's so early,
but, uh...

01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:48.986
I don't sleep.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:52.197
Piss like a racehorse --
every two hours.

01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:54.657
Impossible.
What do you got?

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.870
You were right about Layla.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:03.665
Some of the lce program
is on her home computer,

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.752
but it's not all there yet.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:09.880
She's taking it out in pieces
and putting it back together.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:15.968
How's she getting it out of the
building? That's the question.

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:19.138
And more importantly,
who's she giving it to?

01:15:24.017 --> 01:15:26.228
I want you to take this.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:28.564
Open it somewhere later.

01:15:33.276 --> 01:15:38.573
You know, no matter
how sure we are...

01:15:38.657 --> 01:15:40.699
about a person...

01:15:40.741 --> 01:15:43.577
no matter how close or friendly
you think they are --

01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:45.579
I know.

01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:49.624
I believe Layla's a traitor.

01:15:49.707 --> 01:15:50.625
Yeah.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:51.751
It's just...

01:15:51.793 --> 01:15:52.960
It's ugly.

01:15:53.002 --> 01:15:57.131
This is an ugly business...
you know?

01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:02.177
Can't pay us enough
for this kind of stuff,

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.054
and they don't.

01:16:07.516 --> 01:16:09.892
The truth is,
at the end of the day,

01:16:09.934 --> 01:16:12.479
it's what we do.

01:16:12.562 --> 01:16:15.190
It's a job.
It's not who we are.

01:16:18.192 --> 01:16:20.736
We decide who we are.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.478
All right!

01:17:00.106 --> 01:17:02.567
Morning...sleepyhead.

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:04.985
Sure, come right in.

01:17:05.068 --> 01:17:07.404
Usually when a man ditches me
in the middle of the night,

01:17:07.446 --> 01:17:09.573
he doesn't call the next day.

01:17:09.656 --> 01:17:12.658
Imagine my surprise when
you're banging down the door.

01:17:12.742 --> 01:17:16.037
Sorry. I couldn't sleep,
so I went to the gym.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.538
Breakfast?

01:17:17.621 --> 01:17:19.540
Yeah, sure.

01:17:19.623 --> 01:17:21.292
I'm starving.

01:18:33.483 --> 01:18:36.819
Hey, how about that breakfast
you promised me?

01:18:36.902 --> 01:18:38.237
Huh?

01:18:57.296 --> 01:19:00.173
Cheese eggs --
my dad's specialty.

01:19:01.967 --> 01:19:06.887
He called 'em heart stoppers,
the breakfast of champions.

01:19:07.972 --> 01:19:09.516
-Good?
-Mm-hmm.

01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:13.144
So, do you still think
about it?

01:19:14.395 --> 01:19:16.188
The farm, I mean.

01:19:22.068 --> 01:19:24.529
I wanted Burke to stop.
I told him to stop.

01:19:24.612 --> 01:19:26.197
Nope. Not about that.

01:19:26.281 --> 01:19:27.782
I mean the training.

01:19:27.866 --> 01:19:30.993
Do you think it changes you?

01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:34.496
Learning to lie, deceive.

01:19:35.914 --> 01:19:37.458
Yeah, sure.

01:19:37.541 --> 01:19:42.337
I mean, I definitely think
about things differently now.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.548
I mean, every person I meet
is a possible mark.

01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.925
Sure.

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:52.888
I got an idea.

01:19:54.474 --> 01:19:56.893
Why don't we do
stupid tourist things today?

01:19:56.976 --> 01:19:59.394
Come on, we can go and sit
on Lincoln's knee,

01:19:59.478 --> 01:20:01.229
Iook at
John Dillinger's penis.

01:20:01.271 --> 01:20:03.815
I swear to God,
it's in the Smithsonian,

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:07.485
along with other weird Americana
like the Fonz's jacket.

01:20:07.568 --> 01:20:09.403
What do you say?

01:20:09.487 --> 01:20:11.030
I got to work.

01:20:11.113 --> 01:20:13.908
Work? Wrong answer. What are you
gonna do on Saturday?

01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:17.369
It's your taxpayers' dollars
in action, my friend.

01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:24.584
You sure you got to go
to work?

01:20:24.626 --> 01:20:27.544
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight, right?

01:20:27.628 --> 01:20:28.879
Yeah.

01:20:31.423 --> 01:20:32.466
See you later.

01:20:32.549 --> 01:20:33.550
Bye.

01:20:45.853 --> 01:20:47.355
Gorgeous dog.

01:20:47.438 --> 01:20:49.607
Hey, fella.
How you doing?

01:20:49.649 --> 01:20:51.567
-So nice to meet you.
-She's a sweetheart.

01:20:51.651 --> 01:20:53.485
-She's pretty.
-Thank you very much.

01:20:53.527 --> 01:20:55.195
-See you.
-Have a good day.

01:21:49.161 --> 01:21:50.996
You can't park here.

01:22:28.739 --> 01:22:32.493
The "A" train to
St. Petersburg is now boarding.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:05.731
Oh. Hey!

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.784
Hey!

01:23:58.321 --> 01:24:00.031
Stop! Freeze!

01:24:00.072 --> 01:24:02.033
Freeze!

01:25:57.054 --> 01:25:58.889
Zack.

01:25:58.973 --> 01:26:00.308
Zack.

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:31.127
Hey, you! Stop!

01:26:33.378 --> 01:26:34.588
Stop!

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.932
Suspect's Caucasian and 5'10",
wearing green jacket.

01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:51.687
Ooh!

01:26:54.607 --> 01:26:56.734
The delayed "A" train
from St. Petersburg

01:26:56.776 --> 01:26:58.569
will be arriving
in half an hour.

01:27:01.738 --> 01:27:04.199
The "A" train from
St. Petersburg will be arriving

01:27:04.282 --> 01:27:06.284
in half an hour.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.163
-Hey!
-Sorry.

01:27:11.247 --> 01:27:15.042
...will be boarding
in 15 minutes at Gate "D."

01:27:15.084 --> 01:27:16.919
No sign of the suspect yet.

01:27:17.002 --> 01:27:19.254
Green jacket, male, Caucasian.

01:27:19.337 --> 01:27:22.591
-Affirmative, 21.
-5'10", brown hair.

01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:49.407
This is the Shady Grove Red Line.

01:27:49.448 --> 01:27:52.076
Next stop...

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:05.129
Burke here.

01:28:05.212 --> 01:28:07.632
Zack's dead.

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:09.551
I killed him.

01:28:09.634 --> 01:28:11.177
Where are you?

01:28:11.261 --> 01:28:12.470
I killed him.

01:28:12.554 --> 01:28:14.847
He -- he was working
with Layla.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:15.931
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:16.015 --> 01:28:18.934
James, just tell me
what happened, now.

01:28:19.018 --> 01:28:21.604
Uh, she met him.

01:28:21.645 --> 01:28:23.313
I saw them.

01:28:24.856 --> 01:28:26.983
Zack attacked me.

01:28:27.066 --> 01:28:28.276
I killed him.

01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:30.278
Well, I have to
pull you out, then.

01:28:30.361 --> 01:28:32.487
I have to get somebody else
on this thing.

01:28:34.072 --> 01:28:35.365
Look, let me do it.

01:28:35.449 --> 01:28:37.993
This is what I trained for.
You said so yourself.

01:28:38.076 --> 01:28:40.829
She's probably going back
to Langley to finish the job,

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:42.747
and if she's not,
I'll intercept her.

01:28:42.788 --> 01:28:44.999
I'll get the material,
and we'll meet.

01:28:45.082 --> 01:28:47.084
I can do this.

01:28:47.168 --> 01:28:49.003
Look, please -- trust me.

01:28:51.088 --> 01:28:52.465
All right.

01:28:52.548 --> 01:28:54.842
I'll come into town.

01:28:54.884 --> 01:28:59.222
I'll meet you in the Navy Yards
near "M" street,

01:28:59.263 --> 01:29:00.722
8:00.

01:29:00.764 --> 01:29:03.391
Okay. Navy Yards,
"M" street, 8:00.

01:31:02.333 --> 01:31:04.461
Thank you.
Have a good weekend.

01:32:29.913 --> 01:32:32.582
Layla, pull over
the goddamn car!

01:32:33.667 --> 01:32:35.377
Pull over the goddamn car!

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:36.587
James, what do you want?!

01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:43.551
Shit!

01:32:45.219 --> 01:32:47.763
Don't move! Don't move!

01:32:49.681 --> 01:32:51.933
Open the door!
Open it!

01:32:54.144 --> 01:32:55.729
Don't move!

01:33:00.774 --> 01:33:03.110
Unscrew the bottom.
Do it!

01:33:03.194 --> 01:33:04.195
Now!

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.529
Okay.

01:33:13.203 --> 01:33:14.579
Go.

01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:16.955
I'll tell them you surprised me.
Get as far away as possible.

01:33:16.997 --> 01:33:17.957
What?

01:33:17.999 --> 01:33:19.167
I don't know why you turned.
I don't care.

01:33:19.209 --> 01:33:20.710
James, I didn't turn.
You did.

01:33:20.793 --> 01:33:23.421
I know who I'm working with.
I know what I'm doing. Do you?

01:33:23.505 --> 01:33:25.131
Look, stop it!
I know everything!

01:33:25.215 --> 01:33:26.757
Your mission, the intel,
your parents.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.008
James, I'm CIA.

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:30.594
My mission was to assess the
security protocols at Langley

01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:32.930
to see if I could get
the data out of the facility.

01:33:33.013 --> 01:33:34.097
I did.

01:33:34.181 --> 01:33:37.433
But, Jesus, James,
it's probably bullshit anyway.

01:33:37.517 --> 01:33:39.852
It can't be real.
It was a test.

01:33:39.936 --> 01:33:42.271
They couldn't take the risk.
Nothing was real!

01:33:42.313 --> 01:33:45.106
You are a traitor,
a double agent.

01:33:45.148 --> 01:33:46.942
I followed you.
Zack had your note.

01:33:47.025 --> 01:33:48.944
Zack is working with me.
Zack is CIA.

01:33:48.985 --> 01:33:50.529
Zack is dead!

01:33:50.612 --> 01:33:52.113
What?

01:33:52.197 --> 01:33:54.365
James, Zack is CIA.
He's --

01:33:54.406 --> 01:33:56.033
He fired on me.

01:33:56.116 --> 01:33:57.201
I shot him.

01:33:57.284 --> 01:33:58.244
What?

01:33:58.327 --> 01:33:59.328
I killed him.

01:33:59.411 --> 01:34:01.539
Look, I am on
a CIA-sanctioned mission.

01:34:01.622 --> 01:34:02.665
No.

01:34:02.748 --> 01:34:04.458
Layla, I didn't wash out
of the farm.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:05.835
I'm the N-O-C.
I'm the NOC.

01:34:05.876 --> 01:34:07.962
No, Zack was.
Zack was the NOC.

01:34:08.045 --> 01:34:10.297
No, this is a sanctioned
mission. I received...

01:34:10.297 --> 01:34:11.298
James.

01:34:11.298 --> 01:34:13.007
...orders from my control.

01:34:13.091 --> 01:34:14.509
No.

01:34:14.592 --> 01:34:17.053
Layla, go.
Get out of here.

01:34:17.136 --> 01:34:20.682
James, please, just --
just listen to me, okay?

01:34:20.765 --> 01:34:22.140
Just keep the gun on me.

01:34:22.224 --> 01:34:23.934
Just keep it on there, okay?

01:34:23.976 --> 01:34:25.561
And give me your free hand.

01:34:25.644 --> 01:34:27.354
Just give it to me, please.

01:34:27.396 --> 01:34:29.481
Okay?
Just feel my pulse, okay?

01:34:29.565 --> 01:34:31.816
Look at my pupils.
See if I'm lying.

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:34.402
Now, listen,
I am not a double.

01:34:34.485 --> 01:34:37.780
I work for the CIA.
Zack works for the CIA.

01:34:37.864 --> 01:34:41.032
We are on
an agency-sanctioned mission.

01:34:41.074 --> 01:34:43.076
James...

01:34:45.704 --> 01:34:46.830
Go.

01:34:46.913 --> 01:34:48.707
Run far away.
Disappear, Layla.

01:34:48.748 --> 01:34:50.375
Disappear, Layla!

01:34:50.458 --> 01:34:51.960
No!
James!

01:35:48.053 --> 01:35:49.971
-Hello?
-Layla?

01:35:50.055 --> 01:35:52.932
Listen to me -- the program you
stole from Langley, it is real.

01:35:53.015 --> 01:35:54.809
-No, it can't be real.
-Listen to me.

01:35:54.892 --> 01:35:57.311
This is what I do --
programs, code.

01:35:57.394 --> 01:35:58.729
James, where are you?

01:35:58.813 --> 01:36:00.105
It doesn't matter.

01:36:00.147 --> 01:36:01.982
It doesn't matter.

01:36:02.065 --> 01:36:03.983
I think we started lying
to each other

01:36:04.067 --> 01:36:06.444
almost as soon as we met,
so, uh...

01:36:07.946 --> 01:36:10.615
...so there's no real reason
to believe any of it was true.

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:15.160
But I'm gonna anyway, okay?

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:20.166
-Time's up.
-James...

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.458
-James!

01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:58.783
-All right.
-Jeez!

01:36:58.867 --> 01:37:00.785
You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

01:37:00.869 --> 01:37:02.580
Oh, man!
My dick's on fire.

01:37:02.663 --> 01:37:04.498
Layla says
I'm a double agent!

01:37:04.582 --> 01:37:06.208
-Yeah.
-All right, Zack's dead!

01:37:06.292 --> 01:37:08.042
-What the hell is going on?
-Calm down.

01:37:08.084 --> 01:37:09.002
No!

01:37:09.085 --> 01:37:11.754
Open that glove compartment.
I got napkins in there.

01:37:11.838 --> 01:37:13.840
And put away that stupid gun.

01:37:13.882 --> 01:37:15.300
It's only blanks.

01:37:15.383 --> 01:37:17.050
Come on, I'm wet here.

01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:19.178
Come on.

01:37:20.804 --> 01:37:22.973
Start talking.

01:37:24.183 --> 01:37:25.391
Start talking.

01:37:25.475 --> 01:37:27.560
Congratulations.
You passed your final test.

01:37:27.602 --> 01:37:29.562
-Test?
-These pants are ruined.

01:37:29.645 --> 01:37:31.063
What do you mean, test?

01:37:31.105 --> 01:37:34.316
Everything's a test, remember?
Nothing is what it seems.

01:37:34.399 --> 01:37:36.401
Well, what about lce 9?
That a test?

01:37:36.485 --> 01:37:39.029
Toss it. Keep it as a souvenir.
It's gibberish.

01:37:39.112 --> 01:37:41.239
-No way. No, it's not.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:37:41.281 --> 01:37:44.200
The squibs that went off
on Zack when you shot him.

01:37:44.283 --> 01:37:45.367
What?

01:37:45.451 --> 01:37:46.495
Nothing's real.

01:37:46.578 --> 01:37:48.246
Squibs?!
No, I watched him die!

01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:49.539
-You did?
-Yes!

01:37:49.581 --> 01:37:51.082
Well, I want you
to tell him that,

01:37:51.208 --> 01:37:53.417
'cause we're meeting him
in half an hour for drinks.

01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:55.252
You tell him
you watched him die.

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:56.837
I'd like to see his face.

01:37:56.879 --> 01:37:59.715
I'd like to see your face.

01:37:59.799 --> 01:38:01.091
All right?

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.468
Who gave you the gun?

01:38:03.551 --> 01:38:05.929
Who gave you the gun?!
Me.

01:38:06.012 --> 01:38:08.515
No one's using real bullets,
remember?

01:38:08.556 --> 01:38:11.308
Everything is role-play.
Remember?

01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:14.686
Where were you when we were
going through all this?

01:38:14.728 --> 01:38:16.480
Put that gun out of my face.

01:38:16.522 --> 01:38:19.483
If you want to point it at me,
point it at my chest, will you?

01:38:19.566 --> 01:38:22.235
'Cause they're blanks in there.
Just shoot, okay?

01:38:22.276 --> 01:38:24.737
Point it at my chest
and go ahead.

01:38:26.072 --> 01:38:29.157
Get it out of your system so l
can go home and change my pants.

01:38:29.241 --> 01:38:31.244
Go ahead, shoot. Fire.

01:38:31.327 --> 01:38:32.995
Just shoot it!

01:38:33.079 --> 01:38:34.956
Pull the trigger.
Go ahead, try it.

01:38:35.039 --> 01:38:36.457
Come --

01:39:14.032 --> 01:39:15.032
James?

01:39:19.288 --> 01:39:20.747
James?

01:39:21.999 --> 01:39:24.167
Let me explain!

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:25.918
I don't know, uh...

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.755
...what went wrong.

01:39:33.341 --> 01:39:35.886
You seemed like
the perfect recruit.

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:39.222
I mean, you were smart.

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.850
You were motivated.

01:39:41.933 --> 01:39:43.809
Slayne, some of the others...

01:39:45.394 --> 01:39:48.147
...thought you tried too hard
to please me.

01:39:49.732 --> 01:39:53.109
When you couldn't,
you just snapped.

01:39:53.193 --> 01:39:54.903
You know?

01:39:56.863 --> 01:39:59.282
-I tried to help you, James.

01:40:01.826 --> 01:40:03.828
Got you a job at Langley...

01:40:05.205 --> 01:40:07.123
...after you washed out
of the farm.

01:40:08.666 --> 01:40:12.085
But that wasn't good enough
for you, was it?

01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:13.629
You got bitter.

01:40:13.712 --> 01:40:16.131
You got angry.

01:40:16.215 --> 01:40:19.425
"CIA is just a bunch
of fat, old white guys

01:40:19.509 --> 01:40:22.678
who fell asleep
when we needed them most."

01:40:22.762 --> 01:40:25.807
Remember that?
I got it on tape.

01:40:29.601 --> 01:40:33.105
You see where this whole thing
is going, James?

01:40:33.188 --> 01:40:35.023
Go, go, go!

01:40:37.608 --> 01:40:39.735
You called me.

01:40:39.819 --> 01:40:41.779
You wanted to talk.

01:40:43.531 --> 01:40:47.034
You said you had something
to show me.

01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:53.332
Bragged to me about how you were
gonna screw the company,

01:40:53.415 --> 01:40:55.334
screw us all.

01:40:56.918 --> 01:41:00.547
You even shot at me
in the car -- shot at me.

01:41:02.924 --> 01:41:04.717
And we fought...

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:08.387
...and you hit me.

01:41:09.805 --> 01:41:10.931
Ooh!

01:41:14.517 --> 01:41:16.561
-Well...
-Shit!

01:41:16.644 --> 01:41:19.313
I got my cover.

01:41:21.023 --> 01:41:22.942
You got yours?

01:41:27.195 --> 01:41:28.655
You killed a man, son.

01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:33.243
Killed by your hand.

01:41:33.326 --> 01:41:35.620
You've got no way out but me.

01:41:35.704 --> 01:41:39.124
You're gonna have to negotiate.

01:41:40.292 --> 01:41:43.377
The lce 9 program isn't real.

01:41:43.419 --> 01:41:44.962
It's a fake!

01:41:46.756 --> 01:41:49.675
Oh, no. It's real.

01:41:49.759 --> 01:41:52.594
Switched it myself.

01:41:52.677 --> 01:41:53.887
Remember?

01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:56.806
Once you're in Langley,
you can do anything.

01:41:56.848 --> 01:41:59.559
It's getting it out
that's a bitch.

01:41:59.642 --> 01:42:01.560
I could delete it right now.

01:42:01.643 --> 01:42:03.061
Erase it all!

01:42:03.103 --> 01:42:05.314
That's how to play
the game, James.

01:42:05.397 --> 01:42:08.108
Your daddy would be proud
of you -- that kind of talk.

01:42:08.192 --> 01:42:11.068
All right, that's enough.
You stop.

01:42:11.152 --> 01:42:13.906
You don't talk about him.
You do not mention his name!

01:42:13.947 --> 01:42:15.157
Oh, sensitive.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.242
You're a liar, a traitor!

01:42:17.326 --> 01:42:19.535
He was none of those things.

01:42:19.577 --> 01:42:22.538
Well, he wasn't in the CIA.
Maybe that's why.

01:42:24.332 --> 01:42:26.793
I mean, now that
we're letting it all hang out,

01:42:26.834 --> 01:42:28.627
airing our laundry.

01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:29.628
Bullshit.

01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:31.254
No.
He didn't work for us.

01:42:31.296 --> 01:42:33.173
Bullshit. He did.
He worked for the company.

01:42:33.256 --> 01:42:35.842
Yeah. Shell Oil.

01:42:36.885 --> 01:42:38.135
Sorry, kid.

01:42:38.219 --> 01:42:39.970
Dreams die hard.

01:42:40.012 --> 01:42:42.056
So, now what?

01:42:42.139 --> 01:42:45.059
Am I supposed to fall apart?
Is that it?

01:42:45.142 --> 01:42:48.144
Hand you over the computer
with my desire to please, Burke?

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.437
Well, it's an option.

01:42:49.521 --> 01:42:52.357
Well, here's another option --
shoot me.

01:42:52.398 --> 01:42:53.399
Go ahead.

01:42:53.483 --> 01:42:57.403
Oh, now, you sound like
a sore loser to me.

01:42:57.486 --> 01:43:00.198
Don't you appreciate
the complexity of this thing?

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.952
James, come on, man.
I'm working without a net here.

01:43:04.035 --> 01:43:05.994
And I pulled it off, too.

01:43:06.078 --> 01:43:07.871
I'm clean. You're not.

01:43:07.955 --> 01:43:11.500
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want the computer.

01:43:11.583 --> 01:43:14.085
All right,
now, where might that be?

01:43:14.127 --> 01:43:16.671
First, tell me why.
Why me?

01:43:16.712 --> 01:43:19.382
Oh, why? How? When?

01:43:19.465 --> 01:43:22.343
You're like a bunch of baby
birds with your beaks open,

01:43:22.427 --> 01:43:23.760
waiting for me
to vomit out answers.

01:43:23.802 --> 01:43:24.761
Why me?!

01:43:24.803 --> 01:43:26.847
I needed a partner.
You needed a father.

01:43:26.888 --> 01:43:29.224
What is the principal job
of a CIA officer?

01:43:29.307 --> 01:43:32.935
You develop an asset,
you work 'em, then you turn 'em.

01:43:33.018 --> 01:43:34.895
I found you.
I worked you.

01:43:34.979 --> 01:43:38.023
How much? How much did it cost
to buy the great Burke?

01:43:41.277 --> 01:43:42.444
$3 million.

01:43:42.485 --> 01:43:44.029
That's cash.
This is America.

01:43:44.113 --> 01:43:46.198
Now, are you gonna show me
that computer?

01:43:46.282 --> 01:43:48.159
All right?

01:43:48.242 --> 01:43:50.327
Don't make me kill you, son.

01:43:50.369 --> 01:43:51.703
It ain't worth it.

01:43:51.745 --> 01:43:54.539
It's all about the money.

01:43:55.957 --> 01:43:57.917
You think you know me?

01:43:58.001 --> 01:43:59.502
You think you know me,
don't you?

01:43:59.586 --> 01:44:01.211
You don't.

01:44:01.295 --> 01:44:04.006
There was a time...

01:44:06.759 --> 01:44:09.969
There's this parish priest,
goes up to the pope,

01:44:10.011 --> 01:44:11.679
drops down on his knees,

01:44:11.763 --> 01:44:15.683
starts weeping,
asking forgiveness.

01:44:15.725 --> 01:44:19.561
"Holy Father, Holy Father,
what am I to do?

01:44:19.644 --> 01:44:21.063
"What am I to do?

01:44:21.104 --> 01:44:23.899
"l do not believe in God
anymore.

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.400
What am I to do?"

01:44:25.484 --> 01:44:28.403
You know what the pope said?

01:44:28.487 --> 01:44:30.155
"Fake it."

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:38.412
I couldn't...fake it...
anymore.

01:44:38.496 --> 01:44:40.748
So now I'm gone.

01:44:40.831 --> 01:44:42.291
You get it?

01:44:42.374 --> 01:44:46.377
And so are you if you don't
give me the computer.

01:44:46.461 --> 01:44:47.879
Now. Now!

01:44:47.921 --> 01:44:50.965
All right!
You want your computer?

01:44:51.049 --> 01:44:53.551
It's over there
behind my coat,

01:44:53.635 --> 01:44:55.052
under the stairs.

01:44:55.094 --> 01:44:57.930
It's all yours. Take it.

01:45:01.308 --> 01:45:02.893
Showtime. Went to Langley.

01:45:02.976 --> 01:45:05.103
It's all over.
They've heard it all, Burke.

01:45:17.407 --> 01:45:19.367
Freeze!

01:45:26.873 --> 01:45:28.625
Hold it there!

01:45:37.717 --> 01:45:39.427
Well...

01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:41.344
will you look at this?

01:45:43.513 --> 01:45:47.183
27 years, I'm finally
in the spotlight, right?

01:45:48.935 --> 01:45:50.644
What do you know?

01:45:52.062 --> 01:45:53.981
What do we do now?

01:45:54.064 --> 01:45:57.819
Come get my gun...
or you just want to hang me?

01:45:57.902 --> 01:45:59.236
Hang the traitor.

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:01.488
You ready for that, Slayne?

01:46:02.573 --> 01:46:04.032
Oh, I hear you.

01:46:05.409 --> 01:46:08.286
"Why'd you sell us out, Burke?"

01:46:08.327 --> 01:46:10.121
I sold you out.

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.330
No way!

01:46:11.414 --> 01:46:13.041
Jesus Christ.

01:46:13.124 --> 01:46:16.294
27 years neck-deep in shit!

01:46:16.377 --> 01:46:18.128
Sell you out?

01:46:18.211 --> 01:46:20.130
Did I do my job?

01:46:20.213 --> 01:46:23.633
I ask you -- you do your job?

01:46:23.717 --> 01:46:25.802
I hand you the target.

01:46:25.886 --> 01:46:27.595
I tell you who and where.

01:46:27.636 --> 01:46:28.763
What do you do?

01:46:28.846 --> 01:46:30.556
All you got to do is act.

01:46:30.639 --> 01:46:31.724
What do you do?

01:46:31.807 --> 01:46:34.143
Do you do your job? No!

01:46:34.226 --> 01:46:35.686
I'm obsolete!

01:46:36.728 --> 01:46:38.480
I'm irrelevant!

01:46:38.521 --> 01:46:41.232
Me! Shame on you!

01:46:41.274 --> 01:46:42.735
You yanked me home!

01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:44.987
You shoved me out in the woods!

01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:48.031
-Some lvy League prick...
-Jesus Christ.

01:46:48.073 --> 01:46:49.657
who's afraid of having dinner
in D.C...

01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:50.992
The target is Burke.

01:46:51.076 --> 01:46:54.328
...because of street crime
is judging my worth,

01:46:54.411 --> 01:46:57.831
shoving me in the fucking...

01:47:11.511 --> 01:47:13.387
Put it down, Walter.

01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:19.351
They came for you.

01:47:22.603 --> 01:47:23.646
Yeah.

01:47:28.151 --> 01:47:31.070
The line to the CIA
was a fake.

01:47:32.488 --> 01:47:33.948
You never told 'em.

01:47:35.032 --> 01:47:36.117
No.

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.285
You did.

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:40.537
Nothing is what it seems.

01:47:43.998 --> 01:47:46.751
God damn it, Walter.

01:47:48.002 --> 01:47:49.295
You got me.

01:47:49.336 --> 01:47:51.797
Hand in the cookie jar.

01:47:58.470 --> 01:48:00.847
You got to give me one thing.

01:48:04.058 --> 01:48:06.644
I'm a scary judge of talent.

01:48:10.063 --> 01:48:11.024
Here goes nothing.

01:48:11.065 --> 01:48:12.150
-No.

01:48:12.233 --> 01:48:13.735
-Bye-bye.
-No!

01:48:13.818 --> 01:48:14.819
No!

01:48:44.636 --> 01:48:47.931
All right.
Clayton, you ride with me.

01:48:48.015 --> 01:48:50.726
We're gonna need to
debrief you at Langley.

01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:56.148
James?

01:49:07.575 --> 01:49:09.660
Let's go, Clayton.

01:49:35.141 --> 01:49:37.143
You all right, Clayton?

01:49:37.185 --> 01:49:39.187
Yeah.

01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:41.898
Forgot to turn
your cellphone off.

01:49:41.981 --> 01:49:44.901
That's how we tracked you --
your cellphone.

01:49:46.152 --> 01:49:48.488
I didn't forget.

01:49:48.571 --> 01:49:50.447
I knew she'd do her job.

01:49:52.616 --> 01:49:55.869
Well, I'll remember to team
you two up together next time.

01:49:55.953 --> 01:49:58.037
Next time?

01:50:00.206 --> 01:50:02.417
You were born to do this, James.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.252
It's in your blood.
