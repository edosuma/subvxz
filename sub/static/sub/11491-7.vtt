WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:03.700
Who wants more potatoes?

00:03.710 --> 00:05.120
Hit me.

00:05.330 --> 00:10.290
Uh,Chelsea,the way it's supposed to
work here is that Berta serves us dinner.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.480
I don't mind.

00:11.490 --> 00:14.080
Hear that? She doesn't mind. Shut up.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.110
We're back!

00:16.120 --> 00:17.090
Hey,how'd it go?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.620
I don't know what you
were worried about.

00:18.630 --> 00:20.540
Your son is a wonderful driver.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.650
Oh,well,thanks for taking
him,Mom. He needs the practice.

00:22.660 --> 00:24.620
Mmm,pork chops.

00:28.180 --> 00:29.410
What are you wearing?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.440
Grandma bought it for me.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.900
Pretty cool,huh?

00:31.910 --> 00:33.830
You made him dress up as a chauffeur?

00:33.840 --> 00:34.880
He loves it.

00:34.890 --> 00:37.250
Don't get grease on that jacket,dear.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.910
Yes,Miss Evelyn.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.740
Would you like to join us for dinner?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.860
Oh,no,thanks,I had a late lunch.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.090
And she sent a piece of pie out
to the car,so I could eat,too.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.710
Anyway,I better get going.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.610
Well,thanks again,Mom.

00:50.620 --> 00:51.700
Say thanks to Grandma.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.230
Thank you,Miss Evelyn.

00:54.490 --> 00:55.420
Good to see you.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.250
You,too.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.490
Oh,I almost forgot.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.440
Have you two set a wedding date yet?

01:00.450 --> 01:01.680
No.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.850
We haven't.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.610
But we're gonna.

01:09.380 --> 01:14.500
Well,it just so happens that a client of mine
schedules the weddings for the Bel Air Hotel,

01:14.510 --> 01:18.480
and she told me that there was a
cancellation for the weekend of June 26.

01:18.490 --> 01:19.420
The Bel Air Hotel?

01:19.430 --> 01:20.920
In June.

01:20.930 --> 01:22.570
Charlie,the Bel Air Hotel.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.180
In June.

01:24.190 --> 01:25.640
Yeah,I heard.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.770
What do ya think?

01:27.780 --> 01:30.700
Gee,I don't know. We
hadn't talked about a date.

01:30.710 --> 01:34.580
Boy,it's almost impossible to get
a June date at the Bel Air Hotel.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.480
Thank you,Alan.

01:36.540 --> 01:41.230
Judith and I had to get married at the Sportsmen's
Lodge in November on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.120
Yes,I rember the Indian
corn centerpieces.

01:45.510 --> 01:50.890
Oh,Charlie,I've always dreamed of getting married
at the Bel Air in the garden with the swans.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.220
Yeah,but keep in mind
those birds are vicious.

01:54.690 --> 01:57.540
They look pretty,but they'll
peck your eye right out.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.920
Besides,I thought if we had the wedding here,the
money we save could pay for a nice long honeymoon.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.080
Yeah,I guess that's probably smarter.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.350
Shame on you,Charles.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.160
Depriving your fianc?e
of her dream wedding.

02:10.169 --> 02:14.850
Especially considering all the money you
blew on hooch and whores over the years.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.770
Thank you,Berta.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.150
Tell you what-- the wedding at
the Bel Air will be my gift to you.

02:24.190 --> 02:25.560
Are you serious?

02:25.570 --> 02:28.510
Gee,Mom,thanks,but that's
a little too generous.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.600
A little?! All she gave Judith
and me was a dinette set.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.500
Yes,and who's eating
on that dinette set now?

02:34.510 --> 02:35.380
That's not the point.

02:35.390 --> 02:38.470
Charlie's marriage is just
as likely to fail as mine was.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.070
Thanks again,bro.

02:40.530 --> 02:43.260
Anyway,I asked them to
hold the date for 24 hours.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.350
So you can talk it over and decide.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.060
Thank you,Evelyn. That is so sweet.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.490
Well,I do have an ulterior motive.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.540
The sooner you two get married,the
sooner I'll have more grandchildren.

02:52.550 --> 02:55.990
Why? Does Miss Evelyn need
a cook and a butler,too?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.190
Let me know,dear.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.700
I will.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.650
The Bel Air Hotel.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.270
In June.

03:06.250 --> 03:09.140
Let's see ya get out
of this one,Houdini.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.500
So,have you thought
about your mother's offer?

03:22.510 --> 03:24.870
Yeah,I have.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.220
I've got one question.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.290
Why June?

03:29.320 --> 03:31.360
What's wrong with
getting married in July?

03:31.390 --> 03:33.710
Or the following October?

03:34.570 --> 03:37.060
October is a perfectly good month.

03:37.090 --> 03:41.100
Birds all fly south,so you don't
have to worry about swan attacks.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.430
Charlie,if you don't want to get
married in June,we don't have to.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.150
What? No,no.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.540
No,that's not what I'm saying at all.

03:48.550 --> 03:50.920
Where do you get this stuff?

03:53.180 --> 03:53.920
So?

03:53.930 --> 03:55.620
So,what?

03:55.630 --> 03:58.340
Do you want to get married in June?

03:58.350 --> 04:00.290
Oh,we're back on that.

04:03.290 --> 04:07.500
Well,I can't think of
any good reason why not.

04:07.530 --> 04:09.680
And believe me,I'm trying.

04:10.110 --> 04:11.630
So that's it?

04:11.660 --> 04:15.190
We're getting married June
26 at the Bel Air Hotel?

04:15.830 --> 04:17.209
I guess so.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.570
Oh,Charlie,I'm so happy.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.230
That's only because you don't have
a swan beak in your eye socket yet.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.850
I'm going to go call your mom,and
then my mom and then all my friends.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.490
Good,good.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.620
Alan,we're going to do it.

04:30.650 --> 04:32.480
June 26 at the Bel Air Hotel.

04:32.510 --> 04:34.250
Oh,my God! Oh,my God! Oh,my God!

04:34.290 --> 04:36.370
That's so wonderful!

04:36.450 --> 04:38.680
I know! I gotta go call everybody.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.190
Congratulations.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.680
Thanks.

04:44.730 --> 04:47.370
Wow,the end of an era.

04:48.430 --> 04:49.210
Guess so.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.120
Well,you had a good run.

04:52.910 --> 04:53.790
Yep.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.850
But now it's over.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.460
Forever.

05:00.490 --> 05:02.980
Nothing's going to change,Alan.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.280
Sure,I'm going to be married,but I'm still going to be
the same guy living in the same house with the same woman.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.750
Yes,yes,the same woman.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.050
Forever.

05:13.550 --> 05:15.410
Hey,can I be the best man?

05:15.420 --> 05:17.340
You'll need a sex change.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.690
Where you going?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.200
Out for a drink.

05:22.210 --> 05:23.250
You can drink here.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.900
I could,but I don't want to vomit here.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.520
Wait,wait,wait,I'll go with you.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.300
Why?

05:29.350 --> 05:31.370
I'm not done poking at you.

05:31.970 --> 05:34.370
Hey,shouldn't you ask the
ol' ball and chain first?

05:34.420 --> 05:35.630
I don't need her permission.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.500
Really?

05:36.510 --> 05:38.770
Yes,really.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.610
Although,it is considerate to let your
partner know your plans,so she won't worry.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.230
Sweetie,I'm going out for
a drink with Alan,okay?

05:50.240 --> 05:51.440
Sure! Have fun!

05:51.450 --> 05:54.060
Thanks! Love you!

05:56.830 --> 05:58.720
Shut up.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.250
You're driving.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.110
Jake has one big-ass head.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.190
All kidding aside,she's a great girl and
I'm sure you're going to be very happy.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.450
Thanks.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.190
Forever.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.430
Are you done poking?

06:19.440 --> 06:21.140
For the moment.

06:22.110 --> 06:26.330
Boy,who would've figured that of the two of
us I'd end up being the carefree bachelor?

06:26.340 --> 06:31.070
If by carefree,you mean broke and
lonely,everybody would've figured.

06:36.030 --> 06:36.970
Charlie.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.390
Betsy.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.640
I'm getting married on June 26.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.520
Good for you.

06:42.530 --> 06:43.780
At the Bel Air Hotel.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.490
Nice!

06:47.210 --> 06:51.100
That means no matter how easy
you are,I can't sleep with you.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.000
I can. I'm Alan.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.170
Can he buy you a drink?

07:02.120 --> 07:02.910
What you watching?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.670
Golf!

07:06.410 --> 07:08.270
Don't sneak up on a guy,all right?

07:08.280 --> 07:09.680
Sorry.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.150
Your dad watches a lot of golf,too.

07:13.620 --> 07:17.100
So,listen,how'd you like to
be a groomsman in the wedding?

07:17.110 --> 07:18.290
What do I gotta do?

07:18.300 --> 07:23.430
You just walk down the aisle with one of the
bridesmaids and stand with Charlie during the ceremony.

07:24.020 --> 07:26.280
Tell me more about the bridesmaids.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.870
They're friends of mine.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.960
So,they're old.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.690
No,not all of them.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.290
I have a niece who's about your age.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.130
Is she pretty?

07:35.140 --> 07:36.560
I think she's cute.

07:36.570 --> 07:38.750
Okay,I know what that means.

07:40.630 --> 07:42.240
She's not a brainiac,is she?

07:42.250 --> 07:43.830
What does that mean?

07:43.840 --> 07:47.800
Well,I don't like 'em stupid,but I
don't like 'em talkin' down to me either.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.060
Got it.

07:49.070 --> 07:51.620
And I like a little junk in the trunk.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.900
You won't be disappointed.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.160
All right,I'm in.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.770
Great.

07:58.190 --> 08:01.020
You know,of all the women my
uncle's been with,you're my favorite.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.490
Oh,thank you.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.370
And there's been a lot.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.710
I know.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.680
A whole lot.

08:08.290 --> 08:09.120
Right.

08:09.130 --> 08:11.850
Like,I'm betting around a thousand.

08:14.010 --> 08:17.120
And that's just since I've been
old enough to pay attention.

08:17.570 --> 08:18.370
No kidding.

08:18.380 --> 08:22.860
When I first got here,he told me that
they were coming over to water the plants.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.190
And I believed him.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.870
What did I know?

08:27.680 --> 08:28.970
Sure. You were young.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.040
And naive,too.

08:30.050 --> 08:32.179
We didn't have any plants.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.390
And there were some crazy ones,too.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.840
I'll bet.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.929
Your niece doesn't have a license
to carry a concealed weapon,does she?

08:41.590 --> 08:42.760
No.

08:42.770 --> 08:44.360
Good.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.510
You should've seen where
this one girl hid hers.

08:50.490 --> 09:00.090
Come to find out that what I thought was
a boil on my neck was actually a carbuncle.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.960
Lovely.

09:02.180 --> 09:07.460
Little known fact,uh,carbuncles
are technically in the boil family,

09:07.490 --> 09:10.740
but they take way longer to drain.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.720
Charlie,help me here. I'm dying.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.470
No,you're doing fine.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.960
Tell her about your hemorrhoids.

09:21.130 --> 09:23.240
Please,I'm begging you.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.470
All right.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.740
No sense letting my
superpowers go to waste.

09:29.110 --> 09:34.850
So,Dr. Harper,are we still going to Sun
Valley in your Gulf Stream this weekend?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.400
You own your own trailer?

09:37.420 --> 09:39.910
No,no,no,that's an Airstream.

09:39.940 --> 09:42.150
Dr. Harper has a private jet.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.140
Really?

09:43.180 --> 09:46.180
Oh,yeah. He needs one for his work.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.680
What do you do?

09:48.720 --> 09:52.030
Uh,I am a chiropractor.

09:52.230 --> 09:55.460
A chiropractor without borders.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.340
He travels the world adjusting
the backs of starving children.

09:59.370 --> 10:06.020
Yes,you... you have to be,uh,very careful,um,because
their little bones are very brittle.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.030
You're amazing.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.520
Nah,it's just my job.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.180
You're amazing.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.430
It wasn't tough.

10:15.470 --> 10:17.480
We had her at trailer.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.420
Uh,another round. On him.

Charlie...

11:00.920 --> 11:02.020
Charlie?!

11:02.060 --> 11:03.480
Go away,Alan.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.380
I really think you need to wake up now.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.990
Chelsea's sleeping.

11:10.020 --> 11:14.000
Perhaps,but not here.

11:14.150 --> 11:18.860
Okay,what the hell is your prob...

11:20.160 --> 11:22.330
Oh,dear.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.200
What happened?

11:25.210 --> 11:27.190
I don't know.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.390
Who is she?

11:28.400 --> 11:31.190
I don't know.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.990
What the helldoyou know,Alan?

11:33.030 --> 11:39.810
I know we're in a strange
woman's bed,together,naked.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.570
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:49.610 --> 11:51.250
Good idea.

11:53.890 --> 11:54.970
Do you rember anything?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.770
Well,I remember we were in Pavlov's.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.870
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah. You
were hitting on some chick.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.100
Guess it worked.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.600
Do you happen to rember how I did it?

12:04.630 --> 12:05.620
Alan,focus.

12:05.630 --> 12:10.300
Okay,right,right. I-I think there was
something about a-a trailer in Sun Valley.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.650
Are we in Idaho?

12:13.930 --> 12:16.240
No mountains,no snow.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.210
Why are you wearing my underwear?

12:21.300 --> 12:23.240
Why are you wearing mine?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.250
Oh,boy.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.000
Let's just go.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.340
Should we leave her a little note?

12:30.410 --> 12:31.080
What?!

12:31.090 --> 12:33.110
You know,a thank
you,maybe my phone number.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.500
Are you crazy?! Just keep moving!

12:34.510 --> 12:36.660
But she's cute,and I'm gonna
need a plus one for your wedding.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.830
Oh,my God,my wedding.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.010
You're right,it could be awkward.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.700
What have I done,Alan?

12:45.710 --> 12:50.810
Less than 24 hours after I set a date for my
wedding,I wake up in bed with another woman.

12:50.820 --> 12:52.670
And me.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.210
You woke up in bed with me,too.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.060
What the hell did we do last night?

13:07.110 --> 13:08.320
I wish I knew.

13:08.350 --> 13:09.990
What am I gonna tell Chelsea?

13:10.030 --> 13:12.940
Well,let-let's think. I mean,maybe
there's an innocent explanation.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.940
Oh,really? And what might that be?

13:14.950 --> 13:18.250
- Okay,clearly,we all had a bit much to drink.
- Yeah.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.870
And you and I,being
gentlemen,escorted the lady home.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.920
She invited us in for a
cup of coffee to sober up.

13:24.930 --> 13:28.470
Was that before or after
we switched underwear?

13:30.460 --> 13:31.630
Let me finish.

13:31.640 --> 13:36.550
Uh,so,we went into her apartment and...

13:37.370 --> 13:39.730
I don't know what you're
gonna tell Chelsea.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.280
Here is what you tell her.

13:41.310 --> 13:45.850
Tell her you were detained by the secret
police,strip-searched and water-boarded.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.980
Just drive.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.470
Worked for me.

13:53.110 --> 13:54.600
All right.

13:54.610 --> 13:56.400
Here's what we're gonna do.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.640
We're gonna forget this
night ever happened.

13:58.650 --> 14:00.140
Good idea.

14:00.950 --> 14:03.930
Giddy-up
horsey,giddy-up.

14:07.260 --> 14:10.840
Of course,that may be
easier said than done.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.010
Great. No one's up yet.

14:24.020 --> 14:25.160
All right,go to bed.

14:25.170 --> 14:26.900
I'll see you later.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.140
Charlie?

14:32.150 --> 14:32.780
What?

14:32.790 --> 14:34.720
You want your boxers back?

14:36.700 --> 14:37.650
You keep 'em.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.730
Really? Gee,thanks.

14:41.850 --> 14:43.220
Oh,oh,Charlie?! Charlie?

14:43.230 --> 14:43.930
Yeah?

14:43.940 --> 14:47.570
Uh,if I put 'em in the laundry,Berta
will wash them and give them back to you.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.590
Then hand-wash 'em.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.550
Of course.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.000
Charlie?! Charlie?!

14:55.010 --> 14:56.510
What?

14:56.530 --> 14:58.730
Woolite or a mild detergent?

14:58.760 --> 14:59.750
I don't care.

14:59.810 --> 15:02.620
All right,no worries.
I'll check the label.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.500
Oh,Charlie?

15:06.040 --> 15:06.690
What?

15:06.700 --> 15:09.490
Thanks for taking me out with you
tonight. I had a really good time.

15:39.610 --> 15:41.080
Charlie?

15:41.710 --> 15:42.630
Yeah,babe?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.320
Are you just getting home?

15:44.330 --> 15:48.320
No,no... no,I was a little drunk,so
I slept downstairs for a while.

15:48.330 --> 15:49.870
I didn't want to disturb you.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.980
Did you have a good time with Alan?

15:51.990 --> 15:53.390
Oh,come on,it was Alan.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.860
How much fun could I have had?

15:56.350 --> 16:02.930
Happy birthday Mr. President

16:02.970 --> 16:08.810
Happy birthday To you.

16:10.150 --> 16:12.340
Oh,you don't mean that.

16:12.350 --> 16:16.110
No,no. We had an okay time.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.510
Pretty forgettable.

16:19.190 --> 16:21.060
I talked to my parents last night.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.480
They are so excited.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.250
Not as excited as me.

16:29.190 --> 16:32.080
I'm gonna make you a
great wife,Charlie Harper.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.520
I know.

16:33.550 --> 16:39.340
And I'm gonna... cut
down on my drinking.

16:42.470 --> 16:44.280
Boy,I don't know,Chels.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.000
I really like the white
roses for the centerpieces.

16:47.010 --> 16:48.140
You don't think it's too much?

16:48.150 --> 16:57.490
No. No. The rose symbolizes love,and white
symbolizes,you know,the cleanness of that love.

16:58.770 --> 17:00.020
Cleanness?

17:00.030 --> 17:06.030
Yeah,yeah,like purity
or... untainted by filth.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.770
A white rose is a rose you can trust.

17:10.780 --> 17:15.550
And making it the centerpiece is
appropriate because you're mycenterpiece.

17:15.710 --> 17:20.140
You know,the piece that
supercedes all other pieces.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.589
Are you still drunk?

17:22.630 --> 17:24.720
Only with love.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.900
Oh,it's my grandmother.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.350
Hi,Grammy!

17:31.370 --> 17:34.500
Yeah,it's gonna be a June wedding.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.840
Excuse me.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.310
That's a terrible thing to say,Grammy.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.920
Besides,I said "June," not "Jew."

17:52.200 --> 17:55.000
Okay,what've you done?

17:55.030 --> 17:55.840
Beg your pardon?

17:55.880 --> 18:01.640
That sweet,naive hick you're marrying might buy
this loving,cooperative attitude,but not your mommy.

18:01.650 --> 18:04.380
Hey,can't a fella just be
excited about floral centerpieces?

18:04.390 --> 18:06.390
A gay fella.

18:07.510 --> 18:09.850
You're feeling guilty
about something. What is it?

18:09.860 --> 18:13.730
Nothing. I've got nothing
to feel guilty about.

18:15.580 --> 18:20.120
Okay,okay,okay,now you
give him your underwear.

18:21.610 --> 18:22.910
Charlie...

18:22.920 --> 18:24.870
I'm not really sure what I did.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.980
So,a drunken escapade?

18:26.990 --> 18:29.210
Is there another kind of escapade?

18:29.220 --> 18:33.100
Well,whatever you do,don't
tell Chelsea about it.

18:33.110 --> 18:38.860
Confession may be good for the soul,but
it's a hot lead enema to a marriage.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.790
I know,I know,but I've got these freaky
memory flashes,and I feel so guilty.

18:44.830 --> 18:48.910
Trust me... those memories
will fade with time.

18:48.930 --> 18:49.990
How do you know?

18:50.030 --> 18:52.120
Let me tell you a story.

18:52.260 --> 18:55.570
Many years ago,when I was married
to your second stepfather...

18:55.610 --> 18:57.670
The carpet king?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.360
Well,I called him that.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.780
Wasn't his occupation.

19:02.470 --> 19:11.050
Anyway,he was away on business,and you and your
brother were in summer camp or somewhere,and I...

19:11.060 --> 19:17.390
Well,I was lonely,bored
and the circus was in town.

19:18.920 --> 19:26.300
And when I woke up in that Motel 6,clown
makeup smeared all over my bosom,I was alone.

19:26.310 --> 19:30.930
The Chinese acrobats,the strong man and the
little people had moved on to the next town.

19:30.940 --> 19:33.370
Oh,my God!

19:34.360 --> 19:35.620
What did you do then?

19:35.630 --> 19:37.210
Well,what could I do?

19:37.220 --> 19:41.250
I showered,plucked the
sequins from my hoo-hoo...

19:42.060 --> 19:45.100
held my head up,got on with my life.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.350
And you never told the carpet king?

19:47.390 --> 19:49.710
No,of course not.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.700
I loved him too much.

19:51.730 --> 19:55.950
Your second stepfather was the third
best thing that ever happened to me.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.310
Behind me and Alan?

19:58.690 --> 20:00.780
Sure.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.640
I think some teenagers are fooling
around under the deck again.

20:07.650 --> 20:08.800
Really?

20:08.830 --> 20:12.450
Yeah,I found a pair of men's
briefs by the side of the house.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.240
Damn kids.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.450
No respect for anything.

20:22.230 --> 20:26.880
Listen,Chels... we need to talk.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.870
Something wrong?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.920
Yeah.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.540
What is it?

20:32.660 --> 20:36.960
I got these... these
pictures in my head,

20:36.990 --> 20:41.450
and I'm afraid if I don't tell you
about them,they're gonna drive me crazy.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.780
Go ahead.

20:46.130 --> 20:48.990
Well,what happened was...

20:50.440 --> 20:55.030
my second stepfather went on a business
trip while the circus was in town.

20:55.330 --> 21:03.310
Alan and I were at camp-- or
someplace-- and my mother was lonely.

21:24.670 --> 21:25.930
***
