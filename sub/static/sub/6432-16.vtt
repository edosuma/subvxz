09:12.492 --> 09:15.928
What happened between us,
it wasn't his fault, and...

09:15.963 --> 09:18.264
And I'd really rather talk
about this

09:18.298 --> 09:19.665
at another time
that's not now.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.934
Maybe we can talk about it
when I'm dead.

09:21.969 --> 09:24.470
Okay.

09:24.505 --> 09:27.473
Right? Right.
I will shadow Liam.

09:27.507 --> 09:30.509
Okay, we're gonna go
toss Barton and Davis's cells,

09:30.544 --> 09:32.512
far away from Mr. Hunky Ex.

09:32.546 --> 09:35.348
- He's not that hunky.
- Oh, he's hunky, okay?

09:35.382 --> 09:37.149
He's me.

09:37.184 --> 09:38.417
I knew I was your type.

09:38.451 --> 09:40.953
Can this get any worse?

09:40.987 --> 09:43.756

seem like an odd mix.

09:44.991 --> 09:46.192
I know what you're doing.

09:46.226 --> 09:47.793
You're digging for intel
on Steve, so...

09:47.828 --> 09:49.729
Caught me.
I'm sneaky that way.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.230
I just want to know
how he's doing.

09:51.265 --> 09:53.399
It's been a while, and we
don't exactly Skype every night.

09:53.434 --> 09:55.168
Well, you should have thought
of that before you dumped him.

09:55.202 --> 09:57.971
Right.
I dumped him.

09:58.005 --> 09:59.238
My bad.

09:59.273 --> 10:00.640
It's a big mistake.

10:00.674 --> 10:02.742
It's huge... for you.

10:02.777 --> 10:04.244
It's great for Steve.

10:04.278 --> 10:05.645
He goes out a lot,
you know?

10:05.679 --> 10:07.713
A lot, a lot,
a lot of dating.

10:07.748 --> 10:10.550
Oh, yeah, we call him
"Social Steve."

10:10.584 --> 10:12.385
Steve Jinks, right?

10:12.419 --> 10:15.021
Well, I guess you never
really knew Steve.

10:15.055 --> 10:16.523
Guess not.

10:16.557 --> 10:18.058
He did tell me
about one guy, though.

10:18.092 --> 10:19.259
What's the name of the guy

10:19.294 --> 10:20.827
that he just started dating
last week?

10:20.862 --> 10:22.262
Oh, come on,
you know the guy's name.

10:22.297 --> 10:26.634
Steve just told me about him.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.270
It's okay.

10:29.305 --> 10:32.941
Honestly, I'm glad he has
friends that stick up for him.

10:34.077 --> 10:35.477
You sure you got time
for this?

10:35.512 --> 10:37.847
I heard you got two cons
on the run.

10:37.881 --> 10:39.148
Play nice, Griff.

10:39.182 --> 10:42.017
Secret Service here has got
a few questions for you.

10:42.052 --> 10:44.019
So Barton leaves your crew,

10:44.054 --> 10:46.856
and Davis still
breaks him out.

10:46.890 --> 10:48.691
Why?

10:48.725 --> 10:51.160
No idea.
Can I go now?

10:51.194 --> 10:53.429
Seems like everybody kissed
and made up.

10:53.463 --> 10:55.631
Did the Turks finally learn
how to forgive and forget?

10:55.665 --> 10:56.832
Yeah, right.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.568
Barton would be dead
if he didn't have--

10:58.602 --> 11:00.370
If he didn't have something
that you wanted?

11:00.404 --> 11:03.206
Information?
No.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.975
You'd just kill him.

11:05.009 --> 11:06.142
Money.

11:06.177 --> 11:07.644
He's got some
of your stolen cash,

11:07.678 --> 11:09.745
and now you're groveling
at his feet to get it.

11:09.780 --> 11:13.115
Hey...
Nobody takes our money.

11:13.149 --> 11:15.751
So this is about money.

11:15.785 --> 11:19.589
But it's not your money.

11:19.623 --> 11:23.493
So Barton's trying
to--to buy his way back in

11:23.527 --> 11:25.561
with his own stolen loot.

11:25.595 --> 11:28.230
He's gonna show Davis
where it is.

11:28.264 --> 11:31.499
Davis was supposed
to take you, wasn't he?

11:31.534 --> 11:33.501
But you got dropped
at the last minute

11:33.536 --> 11:35.503
for Barton's big bag of money.

11:35.538 --> 11:38.139
I don't got
to tell you nothing.

11:38.173 --> 11:41.309
Maybe we should ask some of
the other Turks in the prison.

11:41.343 --> 11:42.676
Well, that's a great idea.
We could--

11:42.711 --> 11:45.012
we could tell them everything
that Griff here told us,

11:45.046 --> 11:46.414
and they could just fill in
the blanks.

11:46.448 --> 11:47.782
I didn't tell you anything.

11:47.816 --> 11:49.583
They'd probably be
very interested to know

11:49.617 --> 11:50.684
how helpful Griff was.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.219
I didn't help you.
You guessed.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.720
I would probably leave
that part out.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.955
I'm very forgetful that way.

11:54.989 --> 11:56.156
Yeah?

11:56.191 --> 11:58.325
Well, then I'll tell 'em
the truth.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.160
You've been here talking
to us.

12:00.194 --> 12:02.329
Who do you think
they'll believe?

12:02.363 --> 12:07.200
Look, just tell us where
Barton and Davis are going.

12:07.234 --> 12:12.105
We'll forget this little
conversation ever happened.

12:12.139 --> 12:13.806
So...
[Sighs]

12:13.841 --> 12:18.611
This stuff with Liam--
that must suck, huh?

12:18.645 --> 12:21.747
Yeah, I remember when Amanda
and I split up.

12:21.782 --> 12:25.585
Oh, that was--
that was tough stuff, man.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.253
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.423
I mean, I guess what I'm
trying to say is I can relate.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.893
I mean, sure,
Amanda and I had a chance

12:32.927 --> 12:37.331
to put things to rest,
and now we have a newer...

12:37.365 --> 12:40.567
Slightly weirder relationship.

12:40.602 --> 12:43.303
Maybe this is just a chance
for you to make amends.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.806
You really want to talk
about this?

12:45.840 --> 12:46.940
I know.

13:02.924 --> 13:05.793
You know, the one.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.795
Been there, man.
Been there.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.963
- And then he started lying.
- Right.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.500
Well, you're definitely not
the guy to lie to.

The Turks hang out their.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.258
[Sirens wailing]

18:30.292 --> 18:32.426
Barton obviously
has an agenda.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.228
Yeah, taking out Turks.

18:34.262 --> 18:36.096
What the hell can do this
to a guy?

18:36.130 --> 18:37.130
Uh...

18:37.164 --> 18:39.265
Hey, Liam,
can you give us a sec?

18:39.299 --> 18:40.433
Sure.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.202
Secret Service--
emphasis on the "secret."

18:43.236 --> 18:44.770
Fine.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.706
Okay, so the bottle's
from Italy, right?

18:49.740 --> 18:52.041
Maybe, uh, Pompeii.

18:52.076 --> 18:53.543
An entire city destroyed
at once--

18:53.577 --> 18:55.611
- pretty powerful, right?
- Yeah, fear, sadness, loss--

18:55.646 --> 18:57.079
all those emotions
flying around.

18:57.114 --> 18:58.881
Sounds like artifact-y
circumstances.

18:58.915 --> 19:00.082
Right.

19:00.117 --> 19:02.818
So it's like
a lava flamethrower.

19:02.853 --> 19:04.653
You just point it,
and it burns through.

19:04.688 --> 19:07.923
You point it at a person,
it does this.

19:07.957 --> 19:09.524
So you recognize him?

19:09.559 --> 19:11.693
Yeah, that's the guy
asking everybody about Chris.

19:11.727 --> 19:13.061
Okay, Chris--
who's Chris?

19:13.095 --> 19:14.795
No idea.
I've been here over a year.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.129
We don't have any Chrises.

19:16.164 --> 19:17.931
So he heads right in there
into the kitchen

19:17.965 --> 19:19.532
to talk to Paulie.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.200
I heard some yelling, and then
he was heading out again.

19:21.234 --> 19:23.235
And that's when tattoo
over there saw him.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.570
Okay, so they knew
each other?

19:24.604 --> 19:26.305
I guess so. I mean, they got
into an argument,

19:26.339 --> 19:27.473
tattoo pulls out a knife,

19:27.507 --> 19:29.041
and I'm not dummy--
I got out.

19:29.075 --> 19:31.877
Next thing you know, tattoo's
covered in molten lava?

19:31.911 --> 19:33.179
Yeah.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.814
- How the heck does that--
- Global warming.

19:34.848 --> 19:36.916
Thanks for your help.

19:36.950 --> 19:39.986
Don't forget to recycle.

19:40.020 --> 19:42.655
It looks like this guy Chris
is Barton's next target.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.591
Well, then we need
to get that--

19:44.625 --> 19:46.259
Can I talk to you a sec?

19:49.096 --> 19:50.263
Excuse me.

19:50.298 --> 19:52.232
Look, I'm trying
to catch a fugitive,

19:52.266 --> 19:54.034
and I can't do that if I don't
know what I'm dealing with.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.469
I told you--
incendiary device.

19:55.503 --> 19:58.005
Y-yes, an incendiary device
that drowns people in lava.

19:58.039 --> 19:59.440
Nothing in the world
does that.

19:59.474 --> 20:01.676
Well, there's a lot more
in the world than you think.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.010
Cryptic. Helpful.

20:03.045 --> 20:05.246
Are we working together
on this or not?

20:05.281 --> 20:08.283
Liam, things would be
a lot easier for both of us

20:08.317 --> 20:10.953
if you weren't here.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.322
Speak for yourself, Steve.

20:13.357 --> 20:15.691
[Cell phone rings]

20:15.726 --> 20:17.260
Well, good luck
with your top-secret

national security
spy versus spy.

20:19.764 --> 20:21.031
Where are you going?

20:21.065 --> 20:23.300
My people, who share
information with me, by the way,

20:23.334 --> 20:25.168
just located
the crew's safe house.

20:25.203 --> 20:29.306
I think I might go catch
a fugitive.

20:29.340 --> 20:30.774
You have to go after him.

20:30.808 --> 20:32.109
No, no.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.044
My personal stuff cannot get
in the way of this job.

20:34.078 --> 20:35.879
Agreed,
but if he finds Barton,

20:35.913 --> 20:37.714
he'll find the artifact.

20:37.748 --> 20:39.383
You know him best.
Stick with him.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.385
Pete and I are gonna try
and track down this Chris guy.

20:41.419 --> 20:42.619
Yeah, but I don't--

20:42.654 --> 20:44.855
Look, dude,
there's baggage, okay?

20:44.889 --> 20:46.590
I get it, but for now,
we're stuck with your ex,

20:46.625 --> 20:48.358
and you know him
better than any of us.

20:48.393 --> 20:49.760
I mean, clearly,
he's not going anywhere.

20:49.794 --> 20:52.129
And if he finds that artifact
without us...

20:52.164 --> 20:54.198
it's gonna be a lot more
difficult to explain.

20:54.232 --> 20:55.899
And it could kill him.

21:04.509 --> 21:06.176
- All right, the coast is clear.
- Good.

21:06.211 --> 21:07.845
Wouldn't want to be caught
breaking into a charity.

21:07.879 --> 21:10.047
That'd really hurt
my street cred.

21:10.081 --> 21:12.215
What?

21:12.250 --> 21:13.583
Nothing.
Joking.

21:13.618 --> 21:15.619
- How loud's that music?
- It's so loud!

21:15.653 --> 21:17.588
I've got Beethoven's 8th
going on now,

21:17.622 --> 21:18.856
which is highly overrated.

21:18.890 --> 21:20.357
It's making me
a little irritable.

21:20.392 --> 21:21.659
What's your usual excuse?

21:21.693 --> 21:23.360
You just made a joke
about that, didn't you?

21:23.395 --> 21:25.596
- No, I didn't.
- [Laughing] Yeah.

- I think the--
- Let's go!

21:30.869 --> 21:32.003
An alarm system--

21:32.037 --> 21:33.337
Well, why didn't you
do that first?

21:33.372 --> 21:35.172
- Oh, this is my fault.
- This is all your fault.

21:35.207 --> 21:36.440
- Where is it?
- Get--on the--

21:36.475 --> 21:37.942
- Yeah.
- Ah!

21:40.144 --> 21:42.279
[Alarm stops blaring]
Just like in the movies.

21:42.313 --> 21:43.814
Yeah, this is cutting it
a little too close.

21:43.849 --> 21:46.684
The music is drowning out
all other sound, and...

21:46.718 --> 21:49.888
I got to--
I think I should just go.

21:49.922 --> 21:51.356
You should--
wait, wait. What now?

21:51.391 --> 21:54.093
No, I'm a liability.
You're--you can finish up.

21:54.127 --> 21:56.262
I'll wait in the car.

21:56.296 --> 21:58.297
No, you're doing fine.

21:58.332 --> 21:59.966
I'm the one who's almost
getting us caught.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.736
And this isn't slowing us up
at all.

22:05.673 --> 22:07.573
Yeah, that's not even
remotely funny.

22:07.608 --> 22:10.843
It's a little funny.

22:12.813 --> 22:15.848
According to the photo
on the web...

22:15.882 --> 22:18.551
it should be right here.

Things are missing.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.727
It's probably sold.

- I'm looking for...
- Manifest!

Marble Aphrodite, $85?

22:43.848 --> 22:45.750

who it belonged to.

22:45.785 --> 22:46.919
Yeah.
The buyer--

22:46.953 --> 22:49.455
Mrs. Viola Adams
from Beacon Park Music Academy.

Piano Concerto No. 5]

Are you okay?

22:56.731 --> 22:59.199
Beethoven's
Piano Concerto No. 5!

22:59.233 --> 23:01.635
Why has it switched
to the concertos?

23:01.670 --> 23:03.104
Unless...

23:03.138 --> 23:05.773
What?
Unless what?

23:05.808 --> 23:08.710
Uh, no. 5 was Beethoven's
last public appearance,

23:08.744 --> 23:11.346
'cause after that...

23:11.381 --> 23:14.284
he went deaf.

23:14.318 --> 23:17.087
Thank you.

23:17.122 --> 23:19.857
Pete, I think
I figured out why--

23:19.892 --> 23:21.693
Really?

23:21.727 --> 23:23.595
Well, it was
just sitting there.

23:23.629 --> 23:27.632
I think I figured out why
nobody knows a guy named Chris.

23:27.666 --> 23:28.967
What's up?

23:29.001 --> 23:30.535
Well, there was this waitress.
She used to work here.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.270
She quit around a year ago

the same time that Barton
was arrested.

Here name was
Christina Robertson.

Okay.
Let's go.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.950
[Knock at door]
Coming!

23:45.985 --> 23:47.619
Coming.

23:57.993 --> 23:59.561
Hi, Chris.

23:59.698 --> 24:01.088
It's been a while.

24:10.823 --> 24:12.690
Look, I let you join me here.

24:12.724 --> 24:14.125
Are we gonna talk
about this or what?

24:14.159 --> 24:15.626
I'm not here to talk
about my feelings.

24:15.661 --> 24:16.861
That brings back memories.

24:16.895 --> 24:19.464
Okay, so you're just gonna
follow me around

24:19.498 --> 24:21.633
in case I find out what's
actually going on, is that it?

24:21.667 --> 24:23.134
There are things
that I can't tell you.

24:23.169 --> 24:25.036
- I'm trying to protect you.
- Right.

24:25.071 --> 24:27.138
That must be why you told
your pals that I dumped you.

24:27.173 --> 24:28.477
[Chuckles]

24:28.650 --> 24:30.718
We're trailing a fugitive.
We're really gonna do this now?

24:30.752 --> 24:32.119
Why not?
We never actually did it.

24:32.154 --> 24:34.355
You know, why don't we
just check on the game?

24:34.389 --> 24:36.023
The entune has
all the latest scores.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.459
Steve, you never even
said good-bye.

24:38.493 --> 24:40.561
You just left--gone.

24:40.595 --> 24:43.131
Okay, fine.
Then let's break up now.

24:43.165 --> 24:45.234
You lied to me constantly.

24:45.268 --> 24:48.404
You're a human lie detector!
And it was not constantly.

24:48.438 --> 24:50.306
Yes, sometimes I lied.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.241
You really want the truth
all the time?

24:52.275 --> 24:54.644
Okay, the only thing
you can cook is lasagna,

24:54.678 --> 24:56.145
and even that sort of sucks.

24:56.180 --> 24:58.047
That tea you drink
smells like cat pee,

24:58.082 --> 24:59.982
and skinny jeans
do not look good on you.

25:00.017 --> 25:02.218
- Like that?
- Yes, yes, it's a start.

25:02.253 --> 25:04.153
Oh, come on!
Nobody wants that much truth!

25:04.188 --> 25:06.122
I just--

25:06.157 --> 25:07.457
I just wanted you
to like me.

25:07.491 --> 25:08.758
I loved you!

25:08.792 --> 25:12.095
Yeah. We had plenty of "love,"
but not much "like"--

25:12.129 --> 25:14.063
different thing.

25:14.098 --> 25:16.232
And I wanted to like you,
but you made that so hard.

25:16.266 --> 25:19.469
I felt like you were constantly
on the lookout.

25:19.503 --> 25:21.571
It was terrifying.

25:21.605 --> 25:23.839
I was always scared
I'd screw up, and...

25:23.874 --> 25:25.641
that made me screw up
even more.

25:25.675 --> 25:29.945
Look, I am sorry, okay?

25:29.979 --> 25:31.380
I hate that I can tell,

25:31.414 --> 25:32.981
and I hate
that I care so much.

25:33.015 --> 25:35.116
But this is who I am.

25:35.151 --> 25:37.519
The thing is...

25:37.553 --> 25:41.289
If I can't make it work
with you, if I couldn't...

25:44.026 --> 25:48.196
Then I can't make it work
with anyone.

25:49.666 --> 25:51.967
I'll just have to make
my peace with that.

25:52.002 --> 25:54.670
[Knock at door]

25:54.704 --> 25:56.472
Chris Robertson?

25:56.507 --> 25:58.274
Yeah.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.742
Um, but I'm on my way out.

25:59.776 --> 26:02.344
We have reason to believe
you might be in danger.

26:02.378 --> 26:05.147
May we come in?

26:05.181 --> 26:06.581
Um, sure.

26:09.018 --> 26:11.152
Thanks.

26:14.189 --> 26:15.957
So you're not part
of the crew.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.093
No, I don't want anything
to do that life or those people.

26:19.128 --> 26:22.163
Then why is Barton
after you?

26:22.197 --> 26:25.766
I told you--I don't know
anyone named Barton.

26:28.871 --> 26:30.638
Pete...

26:30.673 --> 26:33.842
Volcanic ash.

26:33.876 --> 26:35.811
Why are you lying to us?

26:38.915 --> 26:40.282
This is the safe house?

26:40.316 --> 26:42.918
You were expecting
beachfront?

26:56.935 --> 26:59.003
Looks like we're too late.

26:59.037 --> 27:01.705
Yeah, somebody tossed
this place.

27:04.509 --> 27:06.343
Barton's definitely been here.

27:09.615 --> 27:12.584
Times, dates--
could be a delivery schedule.

27:12.618 --> 27:14.385
But deliveries of what?

27:14.420 --> 27:16.687
There's a missing page.

27:25.296 --> 27:26.796
Lyon armored car.

27:26.831 --> 27:28.231
This is a pickup schedule.

27:28.265 --> 27:30.132
The next pickup's
in a mall parking garage

27:30.167 --> 27:33.402
about five miles from here
in 30 minutes.

27:33.437 --> 27:35.404
So Barton didn't hurt you.

27:35.439 --> 27:37.673
That's a first.

27:37.708 --> 27:41.344
Did he, uh--
did he threaten you?

27:41.379 --> 27:45.282
Is there someone else
you're trying to protect...

27:45.317 --> 27:46.784
Like your son maybe?

27:46.818 --> 27:49.020
I don't have a son.

27:49.054 --> 27:51.622
Look, Chris,
I was a teenager once.

27:51.657 --> 27:54.425
The dirty clothes,
the heavy metal--

27:54.459 --> 27:56.994
it's all part of the package.

27:58.997 --> 28:03.366
How long has your son
been running with the Turks?

28:06.137 --> 28:07.903
You know,
he's targeting the Turks.

28:07.938 --> 28:09.405
Your son could be
in real danger.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.973
Is that it?

28:11.008 --> 28:12.808
Did--did Barton
come here looking

28:12.843 --> 28:15.144
for your son
so--so he could hurt him?

28:15.178 --> 28:17.179
Look, Chris,
you need to talk to us,

28:17.213 --> 28:19.381
'cause we can find Barton
and stop him.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.249
We won't let him hurt your son,
but you have to coop--

28:21.284 --> 28:23.318
Stop.
You don't understand, okay?

28:23.353 --> 28:26.088
He would never hurt Kyle.

28:26.122 --> 28:29.558
Mykes, that's why the money
was left at the lake.

28:29.592 --> 28:32.694
This isn't about money.
It's about Kyle.

28:32.728 --> 28:34.996
Yes.

28:35.031 --> 28:37.098
Barton is Kyle's father,
isn't he?

28:38.801 --> 28:42.538
He's trying to save him.

28:47.209 --> 28:50.312
Inside every box,
some new piece of crap.

28:50.346 --> 28:53.448
My aunt collects
a lot of crap.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.650
I'm trying to get her
on that show--

28:55.685 --> 28:57.786
you know, the one
people collect the crap?

28:57.820 --> 28:59.587
<i>Hoarders?</i>

28:59.622 --> 29:00.688
Yeah.

29:00.723 --> 29:02.757
They pay a lot?
I like money.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.526
No.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.262
Uh, this particular
piece of crap is sentimental.

29:07.296 --> 29:10.331
It's not worth anything at all,
trust me.

29:17.873 --> 29:21.542
So, um, you guys are going
through a lot of trouble

29:21.577 --> 29:23.311
for something
that's just crap.

29:23.345 --> 29:26.581
Well, you're not the only one
with a crazy aunt.

29:26.615 --> 29:28.983
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna dump these,

29:29.018 --> 29:30.318
and I'll be right back.

29:30.352 --> 29:33.021
Oh, we haven't checked
that box yet.

29:34.890 --> 29:36.190
Hey!

29:37.727 --> 29:39.093
Artie!

29:39.128 --> 29:42.697
Hey!

Don't worry.

30:15.066 --> 30:16.633
Stay.

30:22.774 --> 30:24.975
Give it up, chum.
It's over.

30:28.646 --> 30:29.780
Okay.

30:29.814 --> 30:31.949
I'm sorry.
I just--

30:31.983 --> 30:33.784
I thought maybe
this thing could pay

30:33.818 --> 30:35.753
for the surgery my aunt needs.

30:35.787 --> 30:38.155
She's got a bad heart,

30:38.190 --> 30:42.493
and, uh, she's really old.

30:42.527 --> 30:44.328
Ah!

30:46.298 --> 30:48.833
Yeah!
No mercy!

30:48.867 --> 30:50.768
[Winces] Ah.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.671
Pete and Myka
are on their way.

30:53.705 --> 30:55.373
We'll wait for their backup.

30:57.309 --> 31:00.277
This is it, kid--
graduation.

31:02.114 --> 31:05.350
Then you're part
of the family, right?

31:05.384 --> 31:06.985
That must be Barton's son.

31:07.019 --> 31:09.387
Now waste
this rent-a-cop punk.

31:15.862 --> 31:17.496
We can't let this happen.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.932
Let's go.

31:19.967 --> 31:21.267
Hold it.

31:21.301 --> 31:22.669
[Whispering]
Whoa, whoa.

31:22.703 --> 31:25.371
Barton!

31:25.406 --> 31:27.040
Where's Davis?

31:27.074 --> 31:28.876
Dead.

31:28.910 --> 31:32.947
I'd rather not kill you, too,
but I will.

31:32.981 --> 31:35.716
I'm taking my kid.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.051
Are you trying to be a dad
all a sudden?

31:38.086 --> 31:39.987
I came here to protect you.

31:40.021 --> 31:42.822
These guys protect me.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.957
They look out for me.
They're here for me.

31:44.992 --> 31:47.326
Look at me.

31:47.361 --> 31:49.195
I won't let you make
the same mistakes that I did.

31:49.229 --> 31:51.531
You don't want to go to jail...
or worse.

31:51.565 --> 31:53.333
That's touching, Barton.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.868
But you should know by now
that no one leaves the crew.

for you, Kyle.

32:46.823 --> 32:49.358
Trust me, these people
are not your friends.

32:49.393 --> 32:51.561
They're not your family.

getting all those scores.

You still expect me to believe

this is just
an incendiary device?

for a secret organization

supernatural objects

34:58.460 --> 34:59.760

to protect mankind.

want to talk today?

what I think you're thinking,
are you?

I never think
that far ahead.

if you get swallowed up by lava.

you should go talk to him.

Before this, he was just
some--some guy in jail.

but he did--

36:51.605 --> 36:53.472
he did take a bullet
for you, right?

a good-bye.

to put you on the right path--

getting to know him,

on visiting days.

it's a pretty good day.

to a merchant from Pompeii

to risk anything.

it's a really good thing
