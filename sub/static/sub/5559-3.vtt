WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.037
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.104 --> 00:04.338
For a decade, all
I did was watch people

00:04.405 --> 00:05.573
being murdered.
Can't do that anymore.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.141
I'm tired of picking up
the pieces.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.243
Just once, I need
to stop one before it happens.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.944
My new system?
Oh, Hawk-Eye.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.046
VAN EYCK:
Predictive policing

00:12.113 --> 00:13.547
relying on hard data, not the

00:13.614 --> 00:16.350
psychic instincts
of some genetic freaks.
Freaks?

00:16.417 --> 00:17.685
You want Vega to break the law?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.153
What do you think
she's doing using you?

00:19.220 --> 00:21.422
The feds are
asking questions.
Like?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.524
BLAKE:
How you did all that alone.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.193
Agatha thinks
I'm putting all of us at risk,

00:25.259 --> 00:26.760
that you're just
using me.

00:26.827 --> 00:27.795
You're still seeing it--

00:27.861 --> 00:28.796
your vision.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.377
* I made
lots of time for us... *

00:44.278 --> 00:46.013
(Lina whooping, laughing)

00:46.080 --> 00:49.717
Fun! You see,
I'm having fun, Mark.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.885
Self-Driving on the magway.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.456
But can we go back to driverless
and just chill for a little bit?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.958
Wait. Which one
is the brake again?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.027
Baby...

01:00.094 --> 01:03.397
(screaming, laughing)

01:03.464 --> 01:05.733
Oh, my God.
I prefer the old you.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.201
(alarm sounds)
* I can knock it down...

01:07.268 --> 01:08.902
FEMALE VOICE:
Attention passengers.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.038
What the hell?
FEMALE VOICE:
You are now being diverted

01:11.105 --> 01:12.072
safely to your home.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.974
I knew this was gonna happen.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.643
Good morning, Mark Massero.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.445
On behalf of the Metro P.D.
Hawk-Eye

01:17.511 --> 01:19.079
program, I regret to inform you

01:19.147 --> 01:20.614
that your status
has been upgraded.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.616
My what?! What is this?!
OFFICER:
Due to the recent

01:22.683 --> 01:24.852
pattern of behavior
listed on screen,

01:24.918 --> 01:27.588
our system has flagged you
as an orange level threat

01:27.655 --> 01:28.889
to public safety.

01:28.956 --> 01:29.957
Public safety?!

01:30.023 --> 01:31.825
This isn't a traffic ticket?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.294
Pending a 48-hour police review,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.463
all licenses and rights
to habeas corpus are suspended.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.632
Are you serious?
You can't do this!
This is crazy! Hey!

01:38.699 --> 01:40.000
...or if you wish
to file a complaint...

01:40.067 --> 01:41.335
Hey!

01:41.402 --> 01:42.736
...please follow
the instructions on screen.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.505
Are you listening?!
You can't do this to me!

01:47.175 --> 01:49.109
VEGA:
There were three of them,

01:49.177 --> 01:51.312
Dash, Arthur, and Agatha.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.781
They were called
the Precognitives.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.817
They could see murders
before they happened.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.787
For six years, our police
held them against their will

01:59.853 --> 02:01.822
and used them to save lives.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.992
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

02:05.058 --> 02:07.895
they were finally released.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.131
They kept themselves safe
and hidden from the world

02:11.199 --> 02:13.501
until now.

02:15.436 --> 02:19.407
Welcome to the newest tool
in our police belt, people.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.542
The Hawk-Eye pilot program.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.011
Lynn Dravecky is from central.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.547
She's gonna tell
us more. Lynn.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.318
Machines know what people watch,

02:30.384 --> 02:32.453
what people read,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.356
what people buy,
even what people feel.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.759
And now, they can
tell us which people

02:38.826 --> 02:40.428
are a risk to public safety.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.563
Now, to be clear,
this is not

02:42.630 --> 02:43.931
Precrime.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.366
The Hawk-Eye algorithm

02:45.433 --> 02:47.501
can't predict exact behavior.

02:47.568 --> 02:51.839
What it does do
is notice patterns.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.375
Like this man,

02:54.442 --> 02:57.678
pacing on a subway platform,
flagged by our system for signs

02:57.745 --> 03:00.648
of high anxiety
20 minutes before

03:00.714 --> 03:03.016
jumping in front
of a speeding BRUNO train.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.653
Hawk-Eye could have
saved his life

03:05.719 --> 03:08.289
by flagging his
suspicious behavior

03:08.356 --> 03:10.391
and putting him
under Close Watch.

03:10.458 --> 03:14.061
During this 48-hour period,
he would have been monitored

03:14.127 --> 03:16.063
closely for any risk

03:16.129 --> 03:19.066
to public safety,
including his own.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.934
So then it would have been,

03:21.001 --> 03:22.803
"Sorry, sir,
you're under arrest

03:22.870 --> 03:24.171
for looking nervous..."?

03:24.238 --> 03:26.574
Is there a problem?
I just

03:26.640 --> 03:28.876
hope this department
has really good lawyers.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.344
(laughter)

03:30.411 --> 03:33.080
You'll have to
forgive Detective Vega.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.182
She's a skeptic.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.717
LYNN:
That's okay.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.386
We'll face this kind of scrutiny

03:38.452 --> 03:40.721
if we want Hawk-Eye
to go national.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.089
God help us all.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.658
You know, Detective,
we are selecting top personnel

03:44.725 --> 03:47.295
to partner with
civilian analysts

03:47.361 --> 03:48.896
over Hawk-Eye's trial period.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.765
And I think you'll be the
perfect woman for the job.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.102
Thank you. That is all.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.970
Dismissed.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.306
It's not gonna happen.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.707
Consider it an honor, Vega.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.241
You're trying
to punish me.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.010
You stopped two
attempted murders in two weeks.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.513
This is your chance
to prove you're not just lucky.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.080
I told you, I have
a confidential...

04:07.147 --> 04:09.182
Confidential informant, meaning
you don't trust me enough

04:09.249 --> 04:10.851
to tell me
who's giving you those tips.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.753
Well, if you're
waiting for me to say,

04:12.820 --> 04:15.589
"Of course, I trust you," you're
gonna be waiting for a while.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.326
Listen... not to be shared,

04:18.392 --> 04:19.660
but the feds are going

04:19.727 --> 04:21.929
to be watching our program
with interest.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.364
Now, you know what that means.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.265
You're going to
go suit shopping?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.568
No, this is your chance
to get in early.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.170
Lara, this is going to be big.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.805
Maybe as big as Precrime.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.808
Precrime failed...
catastrophically.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.810
And before that,
it saved thousands.

04:38.145 --> 04:41.315
Isn't that why you became a cop?

04:43.551 --> 04:46.454
Thanks. I appreciate the offer.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.394
Coming through!

04:54.562 --> 04:56.730
(laughs)
Aw, come on!

04:57.831 --> 04:59.967
Passing on the right.
No way.

05:01.869 --> 05:02.836
You better not!

05:04.104 --> 05:05.673
(groaning)

05:09.176 --> 05:11.144
Whoa!
What the...?

05:11.211 --> 05:12.813
WOMAN: Oh, man!
Are you okay?

05:12.880 --> 05:13.814
(laughing)

05:14.915 --> 05:16.950
That's not right.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.352
You saw that coming.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.587
You know, sometimes being

05:19.653 --> 05:21.655
a drug baby has its advantages.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.057
You're born with a gift
to see the immediate future.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.559
It's a small price to say.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.094
And I only get names.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.962
Jennifer Helton.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.698
You get her number, too?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.267
(panting)

05:34.334 --> 05:37.337
I will say,
for a guy who's

05:37.405 --> 05:39.306
never had the athletic skills
of his brother,

05:39.373 --> 05:41.809
you always had
a sneaky competitive side.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.780
That's funny. I was about to
say the same thing about you.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.419
No, not right
now, thanks.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.954
I like to take the edge off.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.190
Oh...

05:57.257 --> 05:58.792
(sighs)

05:58.859 --> 06:01.629
You still seeing
your cop friend Vega?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.331
I should've known

06:04.398 --> 06:06.567
you didn't invite me out here
for brother time.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.603
So, is this a new lecture,
or should I just tune out?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.338
I just want you
to be more careful

06:11.405 --> 06:13.206
when you're choosing friends--
not just her, but everyone.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.342
Well, that's not paranoid.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.579
Man, you always go there first--
right to the worst in people.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.081
And so should you, because
there's a worse in everyone,

06:21.148 --> 06:22.550
dying to get out.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.518
Gangsters, accountants,

06:24.585 --> 06:27.354
cheating husbands,
even old ladies with cats.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.090
Everyone is capable
of anything.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.525
And we've seen it all.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.666
Like your new friend
Mr. Massero.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.435
I don't know anybody
named Massero.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.472
You're about to.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.908
(gasps, groans)

06:47.975 --> 06:50.243
(distorted, distant):
...crazy...

06:50.310 --> 06:51.078
Yeah!

06:57.284 --> 07:00.688
(distorted, angry shouting)

07:01.889 --> 07:03.290
(gasps)

07:03.356 --> 07:05.392
See? People never fail

07:05.459 --> 07:07.160
to disappoint you.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.968
VEGA: He's in pain.
Almost done?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.637
WALLY: Almost got it.
Almost got it.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.839
Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay...

07:18.906 --> 07:19.640
Okay!

07:19.707 --> 07:22.142
We got it.
(sighs)

07:22.209 --> 07:23.711
Bad?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.013
Peachy.
WALLY:
I'm not gonna lie to you.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.148
Removing visions
from the dopaminergic system

07:28.215 --> 07:30.951
of your brain-- not
unlike being scalped.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.753
Good news is,
you get to keep your hair.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.488
All right, here we go.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.790
Okay, so we know
it's daytime.

07:36.857 --> 07:40.193
Two males, and Arthur gave you
the name Massero.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.829
Looks like a fistfight.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.664
Maybe roadside or
something, and...

07:45.098 --> 07:46.967
The loser gets his
head stomped in.
If it's a fight,

07:47.034 --> 07:49.102
that means
the murder's not premeditated.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.237
It's gonna happen soon.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.939
There might be enough
to run both faces.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.641
I'm gonna get Akeela on it.
You don't have to.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.042
That's Mark Massero.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.847
Chief creative officer
and brains behind Narcissus?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.215
The tech company?
Tech giant.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.817
He tried to poach me once.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.786
He'd eat his
young to launch

08:05.853 --> 08:07.588
the next big thing.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.657
So, if that's the guy
who won, then,

08:09.723 --> 08:11.224
who's the guy who lost?

08:15.529 --> 08:18.799
Closest face-match I have
is a man named Trevor Maloney,

08:18.866 --> 08:21.168
a fitness instructor
out of Philadelphia.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.704
Is he in Philly now?
AKEELA:
Uh, no.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.338
But his gym says
he's on his way here

08:25.405 --> 08:26.774
training for the Liberty Tour.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.275
I don't know what that means.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.577
It's a bicycle race

08:29.643 --> 08:30.844
that finishes in D.C.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.746
It runs along
Cherry Hill Road.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.748
Where did you pull this photo,
anyway?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.149
Looks not even digital.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.251
Have you heard of a guy
named Mark Massero?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.788
Yeah, of course. Why?
VEGA:
I'm following a lead.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.056
I'm trying to find a link
between him and Maloney.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.794
There's nothing on file yet,
but I'll keep look... Wait.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.663
Mark Massero was
flagged by Hawk-Eye

08:49.730 --> 08:51.098
for a recent pattern

08:51.164 --> 08:53.166
of high-risk behavior.
VEGA:
Hawk-Eye?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.368
So, does that means
he's been placed on Close Watch?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.104
Yup. Meaning, as of tomorrow,

08:57.170 --> 09:01.241
we can assign a Hawk-Eye unit
to track his every move.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.376
Seriously,
who gave you the picture?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.112
Uh, sorry, Akeela, got to go.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.247
(beep)

09:07.314 --> 09:09.316
What's going on?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.118
(sighs)
Is something wrong?

09:11.184 --> 09:13.687
Yes. Us.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.090
Blake is still asking questions
about my new informant.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.692
If we keep this up,
we're gonna get caught.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.393
I told you, I am
willing to risk that.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.296
I'm not just gonna
sit and watch.
I'm not asking you to.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.233
I want you
to come work with me.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.236
With you?
We're hiring
civilian analysts

09:29.302 --> 09:30.537
for Hawk-Eye.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.972
It's a new pilot program.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.207
But they'll be partnered
with cops at Metro.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.508
We'd have real cover.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.877
WALLY:
To track a person's every move

09:36.944 --> 09:38.846
without due process.
It's a power grab

09:38.912 --> 09:41.181
of our civil liberties.
You done?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.750
For now.
You...

09:42.816 --> 09:44.551
You want me
to go back...

09:44.618 --> 09:47.420
inside Metro?

09:47.487 --> 09:50.123
I haven't been
there since...
Since you were hooked up

09:50.190 --> 09:52.626
in a milk bath, I know.
WALLY:
No.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.630
Actually, you don't. No one
knows what they went through.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.798
Yeah, and nobody ever
saw their faces

09:57.865 --> 10:00.000
up close, remember?
Except you, Wally.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.635
Dash is anonymous.
DASH:
You know I don't even have

10:01.702 --> 10:04.137
a legal name, so...
Yeah, but your brother

10:04.204 --> 10:06.473
is an identity thief.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.776
The years we lost...

10:08.842 --> 10:10.944
in that building.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.282
That's not gonna happen again.

10:15.348 --> 10:20.253
No one is going to find out
who you are, Dash.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.955
I'll make sure of it.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.863
(muffled, distorted
voice speaking)

10:36.970 --> 10:38.839
(sighs)

10:38.906 --> 10:42.009
AGATHA: But it's gotta...
Slow down. Slow down.
Just tell me what you saw.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.277
A containment chamber,
harnesses, equipment.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.713
Wires for our brains.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.080
A milk bath.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.749
Like the one
that held us during Precrime.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.184
You've been seeing the same
future for months now, Agatha.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.285
Yes, but

10:52.352 --> 10:54.822
this is the first time
that I saw her,

10:54.888 --> 10:58.091
the detective...
your brother's friend.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.392
Vega?

10:59.459 --> 11:00.360
Are you sure?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.429
She's there
when they put us in it.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.297
Do you think she sells us out?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.398
Why would she do that?

11:05.465 --> 11:06.633
Well, before Precrime ended,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.001
the government
had bigger plans for us.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.270
But they scrapped that program;
they set us free.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.371
Officially.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.740
You think they want us back?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.842
Away from scrutiny,
out of the public eye.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.109
A secret program.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.778
All right,
even if that was true--

11:17.845 --> 11:19.146
and that is a big if--

11:19.212 --> 11:21.849
good luck finding out
who's looking for us.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.817
We need someone on the inside.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.986
Inside? The NSA?
Department of Defense?

11:26.053 --> 11:28.088
Yeah, sure, I'll call a guy.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.723
I know someone.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.491
You do?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.426
Yes. You forget where I live.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.262
Actually, I don't--
you live on the Island

11:35.328 --> 11:36.730
of Misfit Toys,
filled with people

11:36.797 --> 11:38.131
running away
from the government,

11:38.198 --> 11:39.232
not those in it.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.201
And if you found someone,
how do you know

11:41.268 --> 11:43.036
we could trust this person
with our secret?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.571
Arthur,
you just keep a close eye

11:44.637 --> 11:46.874
on your brother and his friend.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.642
I've got this.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.847
I'm not helping this time,
so go away.
DASH: We already know

11:53.914 --> 11:56.316
the names:
Mark Massero and Trevor Maloney.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.885
Well done.
You don't need me. Now,

11:57.951 --> 11:59.753
could I eat my dinner in peace?
VEGA: The murder

11:59.820 --> 12:02.990
isn't why we're here.
We need to buy a new identity.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.059
Saying that too loud undermines
my very reputable career

12:06.126 --> 12:07.995
as an estate planner.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.464
(whispering):
My bios don't come cheap.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.266
There's
ancestral platforms,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.002
gears to grease
for background checks.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.437
Yeah, we were counting
on a family discount.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.439
You?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.643
I suppose
it's about time.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.112
Finally get a job?

12:25.178 --> 12:28.215
Yes, I'll be working
for the police.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.549
(gags)

12:29.616 --> 12:31.251
(gags)

12:31.318 --> 12:33.620
(with mouth full):
I'm sorry?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.288
Again?
You heard me right.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.425
Are you trying to get us caught?
VEGA: This is
the best way

12:38.491 --> 12:39.860
to keep that from happening.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.829
No. The best way
would be for you to disappear

12:41.895 --> 12:43.330
from both
of our lives.
I am doing this,

12:43.396 --> 12:46.099
Arthur,
with or without your help.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.701
Good luck, then.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.437
You're on your own.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.742
You know, there's a little
off-track betting operation

12:55.809 --> 12:56.977
in the Sprawl.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.079
You have
runners place bets

12:59.146 --> 13:01.114
because you know the outcome.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.018
I only told her so her friends
don't shut it down.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.423
You may survive out here
after all.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.195
And maybe it's better
if we don't tell Agatha.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.729
No problem.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.331
We never talk.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.539
A precog is helping you?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.075
Shh! Akeela, no one can know.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.442
People could take
advantage of him.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.878
The government,
foreign governments.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.013
You got to take this
to your grave.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.915
I will, I swear.
This is huge!

13:34.982 --> 13:36.049
(laughs softly)

13:36.116 --> 13:38.852
What is... what is he like?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.453
I mean,
what would you be like,

13:40.520 --> 13:43.123
if you had seen a thousand
violent murders? He...

13:43.190 --> 13:45.592
He's going through some stuff.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.295
(whispers):
Wow.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.462
That's...

13:49.529 --> 13:50.797
Wow, a precog!

13:50.864 --> 13:53.633
Can I meet him?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.035
Which one is it?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.937
It's one of the
twins. Dash.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.771
(laughs)
And yes, you can meet him.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.540
Because we need your help.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.242
You're interviewing

14:02.309 --> 14:04.444
Hawk-Eye civilian
analysts.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.346
Yeah...

14:08.281 --> 14:10.217
Oh.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.685
No. No. Lara...
Okay, just hear me out.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.487
I need this job.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.389
This is a good thing
we're doing here,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.725
and you could help us.
(groans)

14:18.791 --> 14:20.327
Akeela, please.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.474
(horse nickers)

14:34.541 --> 14:36.576
AGATHA: If the infection
hasn't cooled off by morning,

14:36.643 --> 14:38.345
you call me back.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.047
Okay. Will do.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.449
Okay, so,
what do I owe you?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.452
Cup of coffee would be fine.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.322
I never get tired
of this place.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.625
When did you come to
the island, Charlie?

14:52.692 --> 14:53.860
Well, uh...

14:53.927 --> 14:55.595
going on six years.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.265
From San Antonio--
is that what Ned told me?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.100
Yep.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.769
Why did you leave?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.205
Mm, get out of the city.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.707
You?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.676
Same.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.679
It's a lot quieter
out here.
Mm.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.848
I knew a man who worked
at Lackland Air Force Base

15:15.915 --> 15:17.284
in San Antonio.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.653
Lucas Tollin?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.223
(sighs)

15:23.290 --> 15:25.525
Mm, can't say
I ever met the man.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.360
Sure you did.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.197
Before that, he worked
at Thurn-Tippett in Chicago.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.599
The security
contractors.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.035
Why would I know a man
from Illinois?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.636
Because you worked there
for ten years

15:36.703 --> 15:39.006
before you embezzled
$1.7 million from them

15:39.072 --> 15:41.341
and came here.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.476
Searching
for some peace and quiet.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.449
But you never found
the peace, did you?

15:49.516 --> 15:52.652
Maybe it's true what people
around here say about you.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.121
And what's that?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.855
That you are a witch.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.425
Oh, never to my face, Charlie.

16:01.828 --> 16:05.398
Before you open the safe
and grab that bag tonight...

16:05.465 --> 16:09.036
keep an eye on that mare's leg.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.745
(indistinct chatter,
distorted and echoing)

16:22.915 --> 16:25.052
*

16:30.590 --> 16:32.692
(soft exhale)

16:41.968 --> 16:43.370
(sighs anxiously)

17:02.989 --> 17:05.625
(electronic whirr, blipping)

17:05.692 --> 17:07.827
Dashiell Parker.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.396
Uh, senior engineer

17:09.462 --> 17:11.731
at Timeraft?
Mm, that's correct.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.267
You supported
both the data access layer

17:14.334 --> 17:15.668
and the front end.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.970
Glad to see you came around
on joining Hawk-Eye.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.739
DASH:
That's correct.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.541
This your new analyst?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.343
Figured if I'm
gonna have a partner,

17:23.410 --> 17:24.944
I should see
what I'm getting into.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.680
AKEELA: What kind of features
were included in the vector?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.882
Good question, Akeela.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.285
Thank you.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.754
Continuous.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.723
Mostly user ratings, uh...

17:36.789 --> 17:40.160
micropayments.
Pretty nervous,
even for a job interview.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.861
What's going to happen
when he sees blood?

17:41.928 --> 17:43.930
AKEELA: Well, uh, we're placing
candidates with our detectives

17:43.996 --> 17:45.998
in the field immediately.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.902
It's a trial period so that
we can test compatibility.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.239
It does not mean
you have the job.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.141
I'm not sure I want it.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.676
Of course, I do.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.645
Uh... w-want it.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.248
Make sure
you send me his file.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.656
Do you... also understand that

18:09.722 --> 18:12.759
your job performance reflects
on the men and women

18:12.825 --> 18:14.327
of this department?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.229
Yes.
And that if

18:16.296 --> 18:19.166
you mess up, we all mess up.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.067
Of course.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.203
And some of us...

18:23.270 --> 18:26.839
really... really like it here?

18:29.942 --> 18:33.079
Your confidence in me
will be rewarded.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.647
I will make you proud.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.317
I'll settle
for not getting fired.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.220
VEGA:
I read up on Mark Massero.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.222
Boy genius,
revolutionary innovator.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.124
He had a meteoric rise
until a year ago.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.793
What happened then?
The magic left.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.162
All it took was
one failed product launch

18:49.229 --> 18:50.763
and the stock price dipped.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.800
Now, word is, is that the board
is thinking about replacing him.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.603
You think the victim could be
connected to this somehow?

18:56.669 --> 18:59.138
Trevor Maloney?
Could be a motive.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.174
Listen to you.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.109
Nothing that
I've found yet,

19:03.176 --> 19:04.811
but that's what
we need to find out.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.814
Just remember,
you're a civilian analyst.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.682
So don't get too excited.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.084
(sighs)
Guess we're doing this.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.386
Yeah.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.655
I really don't want
to regret it.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.497
Good morning.
Welcome to Narcissus.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.565
Lara Vega,

19:25.632 --> 19:27.133
Dashiell Parker--
Metro Police.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.835
We're looking
for Mark Massero.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.437
Please follow the blue line,

19:30.503 --> 19:31.704
and someone will
assist you.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.188
Hi.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.891
Eli Winford,
product development.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.926
How can I help you, Officers?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.695
Detective. Vega.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.763
Nice to meet you.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.998
My name is Parker.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.634
Mark Massero isn't in today.
Is that unusual?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.035
Not really.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.237
No one punches
a clock here.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.638
Even with the board
about to vote

20:05.705 --> 20:07.039
on his future
at the company?

20:07.106 --> 20:09.676
You think that
he'd at least show his face.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.711
I don't know where
you heard that.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.247
Same place that I heard that his
behavior's been erratic lately.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.283
Self-driving
on the mag-way.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.084
Applying for a handgun license?

20:18.150 --> 20:20.520
Mark likes to live life
to the fullest.
Is that what

20:20.587 --> 20:21.921
you call threatening a coworker?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.423
I understand that he went off

20:23.490 --> 20:25.592
on one of the coders the night
of the failed launch party.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.594
That's what makes Mark
who he is.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.429
Hmm...
He loves his job.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.097
And he really hates to fail.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.899
Enough to hurt someone?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.502
Do you know a lot about
the tech business,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.370
Detective?
No.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.805
Just failure.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.006
Failure is why

20:40.072 --> 20:41.474
I got into my business.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.476
But I'm not a detective.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.812
I'm a Hawk-Eye analyst.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.214
First day.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.082
Hawk-Eye? Really?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.584
It's come to this?

20:51.651 --> 20:54.487
Mark Massero
would not harm a soul.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.456
I hope not, for your sake.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.224
Because news that
Hawk-Eye flagged him

20:58.291 --> 20:59.526
as a public risk...

20:59.592 --> 21:01.127
won't help your stock price.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.530
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Winford.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.398
We'll catch Mr. Massero at home.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.700
You walk when I walk.
Coming.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.043
Nice bike!

21:17.109 --> 21:19.045
Someone likes to go fast.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.747
Bluejay C-680.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.649
They stopped
making them in '46.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.584
That's not street-legal.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.721
Wasn't much to do
on the island.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.590
Except ride.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.970
Show me thermal.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.772
(whirring)

21:50.943 --> 21:52.545
Stay here.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.149
(clattering in distance)

21:57.216 --> 21:58.718
(woman grunting)

22:01.821 --> 22:03.022
Metro PD!
(woman screams)

22:03.089 --> 22:04.657
Whoa! What the...

22:04.724 --> 22:06.459
The owner of this house
was flagged high-risk.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.660
I-I saw signs

22:07.727 --> 22:08.861
of struggle.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.498
Do we look like
we're struggling to you?

22:11.564 --> 22:14.033
Yeah. Um, do you have
a minute?

22:15.768 --> 22:18.270
He snuck up behind me
and pulled me in here.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.739
We were being spontaneous.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.608
You left the
front door open.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.109
Anybody could
have walked in.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.477
So then you see the appeal.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.879
Absolutely.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.314
(clears throat)
Is what we did

22:28.381 --> 22:30.517
a crime?
No,

22:30.583 --> 22:31.884
it's not.
Okay. So...

22:31.951 --> 22:34.621
remotely disabling
my car's firmware

22:34.687 --> 22:37.089
so I can't drive
isn't enough.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.858
Now I can't have sex

22:38.925 --> 22:40.159
in my own house

22:40.226 --> 22:42.028
with my wife.
Does that also

22:42.094 --> 22:43.496
explain your love of fast cars?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.297
I'm sorry?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
Low inhibitions.
High tolerance for risk.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.336
If you were in your 60's,
I'd call that a midlife crisis.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.738
I call it living.
Is that why

22:51.804 --> 22:53.406
you're going
to your therapist later?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.544
I'm guessing.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.412
I mean, I saw it

22:59.479 --> 23:01.914
when I...

23:01.981 --> 23:05.151
Hawk-Eye informed us
you have an appointment.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.219
That is none
of Hawk-Eye's business.
You know,

23:07.286 --> 23:08.387
actually, it is.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.657
How do you know Trevor Maloney?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.124
Who?

23:15.361 --> 23:16.929
Who is he?

23:16.996 --> 23:18.230
I have never

23:18.297 --> 23:19.766
seen that man before.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.537
Are we done here?

23:27.507 --> 23:29.308
I'm not sure I believe him.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.977
That he and Maloney never met?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.244
Yeah.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.380
Maybe his shrink
will tell us.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.848
Your lead.
The therapist.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.517
Massero is
hiding something.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.918
We're gonna find out what.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.386
(watch rings)

23:40.453 --> 23:42.221
Akeela, what's up?

23:42.288 --> 23:43.623
Hey. Hi.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.626
Uh, so,
I'm just leaving Blake's office,

23:46.693 --> 23:49.896
and he's asking to meet
with your new Hawk-Eye analyst,

23:49.962 --> 23:53.199
Dashiell.
He wants him to come in.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.068
Alone.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.604
(quietly):
Vega,

23:57.670 --> 24:00.006
I think he knows.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.950
*

24:34.073 --> 24:36.108
(phone line ringing)

24:36.175 --> 24:37.143
Oh, hey.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.946
Yeah, it's me.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.486
Hey.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.455
Still getting settled

24:49.522 --> 24:51.290
in the new digs.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.260
It's a nice office,
don't you think?
Yes.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.728
Yes, it is.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.730
Sorry I pulled you
in like this.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.532
Uh, we hadn't met.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.101
Protocol.
Sure. I understand.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.371
I, uh... I pulled up
your application.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.240
You did? Great.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.241
Impressive.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.578
So impressive that--

25:11.644 --> 25:14.213
I'll be honest-- uh...

25:14.280 --> 25:16.215
I have questions.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.718
Okay.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.721
Why would you leave a...

25:21.788 --> 25:24.390
a high-paying job in
the private sector to work here?

25:24.456 --> 25:27.326
The money was good, sure, but...

25:27.393 --> 25:29.696
I felt like I wasn't doing
enough to make this world

25:29.762 --> 25:32.632
a better place.
Wow.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.902
You don't just look
like a Boy Scout.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.070
But there's something else.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.939
There is?

25:47.413 --> 25:49.081
Detective Vega,

25:49.148 --> 25:51.117
well, she doesn't
appreciate

25:51.183 --> 25:53.686
what we have going here.
She's cynical.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.688
I have noticed that.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.290
But she's very good
at what she does.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.227
I mean,
it seems that way.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.195
On first impression.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.096
Of course.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.133
But she has a
tendency to, uh,

26:07.199 --> 26:09.736
color outside the lines.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.972
You will let me know
if there's any problems,

26:13.039 --> 26:15.307
won't you?
Sure.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.243
Great.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.678
Six handicap, huh?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.579
I'm sorry?
Your résumé.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.282
Says you golf.
Uh...

26:23.349 --> 26:26.118
Yeah, I don't like
to talk about it.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.555
Okay. Well, we'll have to play
sometime. But I want strokes.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.191
Sure. Just... bring 'em along.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.696
(exhales)

26:43.870 --> 26:46.806
Dr. Emory.
Sixth floor, suite 611.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.775
VEGA:
Thanks. I got it already.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.778
Did you see a
shrink, after...?

26:51.844 --> 26:54.781
It was more of a panel.
Some poking and prodding.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.783
I don't know
if it really helped.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.718
What do you think?

26:58.785 --> 27:01.053
Might need a follow-up.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.789
What about you?
After your father was killed?

27:02.855 --> 27:06.025
Or is that too hard
to talk about?
Okay, please don't turn this

27:06.092 --> 27:08.127
into every relationship I've
been in for the last ten years.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.862
Yes, it was a traumatic event
and, yes, there's some stuff

27:09.929 --> 27:11.664
I need to deal with.
And I will when I have time.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.666
But right now I don't.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.335
Yeah, really, what's the hurry?

27:16.402 --> 27:17.603
I do the one-on-one sessions.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.439
The staff handles the TMS.
TMS?

27:20.506 --> 27:22.074
Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.878
Neurological fine-tuning,
as I like to call it.

27:25.945 --> 27:28.214
You do this
out in the open?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.216
This isn't 2035.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.984
Back in the dark ages
of the early century,

27:32.051 --> 27:34.520
mental illness
was a source of shame:

27:34.586 --> 27:36.923
fears, traumas,
personality flaws.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.425
These days, maintaining
a fit mind is as easy as keeping

27:39.491 --> 27:40.727
a fit body.
So you can

27:40.793 --> 27:42.628
fix damaged brains?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.496
"Fix" is the wrong word.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.532
Healing is always
a long process.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.200
But, yes, I can offer hope

27:48.267 --> 27:51.470
to those who suffer.
I need to talk to you alone.

27:51.537 --> 27:53.840
About a patient. Mark Massero.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.307
You know I can't do that.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.509
Actually, you can.

27:57.576 --> 28:00.479
Your patient was flagged
a potential risk by the city's

28:00.546 --> 28:02.481
new...
Hawk-Eye program.

28:02.548 --> 28:03.950
I heard.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.052
Mark was a little agitated
this afternoon.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.386
Then you know
that the provisions bypass

28:07.453 --> 28:09.989
doctor-patient confidentiality.
Denying access

28:10.056 --> 28:11.657
is a felony
punishable by jail.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.860
How do you sleep at night,
Detective,

28:13.926 --> 28:16.796
knowing that you work
for a police state?

28:16.863 --> 28:18.798
Well, some nights I don't.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.801
But I sleep much better
when I catch the bad guys.

28:21.868 --> 28:25.071
Are you going
to cooperate, Doctor?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.341
Mark was having issues
with his work.

28:29.408 --> 28:33.012
He was always known for his
creativity, his conviction.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.547
But after his big promotion,
he was paralyzed with fear.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.349
He came to me
to change that.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.985
You fine-tuned his brain.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.987
I saved his career.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.822
And his marriage.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.691
What do you mean by that?
His wife, Lina,

28:45.758 --> 28:47.259
was having an affair.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.962
With who?

28:50.029 --> 28:52.765
You'd have to ask her.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.867
You're saying Lina was having
an affair with Trevor Maloney?

28:54.934 --> 28:56.535
I hope so.
'Cause if she was,

28:56.602 --> 28:58.037
we found Massero's motive.

29:04.710 --> 29:05.945
I don't even know this Trevor.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.613
We know you cheated
on your husband, Lina.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.949
Like I said,

29:10.016 --> 29:12.218
I never met that guy.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.488
My affair was a fling

29:16.555 --> 29:18.357
after a college reunion.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.460
I told Mark about it
right after it happened.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.995
We hit a
rough patch,

29:23.062 --> 29:25.064
but we worked
it out.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.933
He started TMS with Dr. Emory.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.735
It made him a different man,

29:29.802 --> 29:33.039
more willing
to take risks.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.007
We have never been better.

29:35.074 --> 29:38.010
We need to talk to your husband.
He isn't here.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.545
Well, if you don't tell us
where he is, you'll be arrested

29:39.611 --> 29:42.548
for interfering
with a police investigation.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.651
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.386
Although I would
have preferred to.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.155
There's a race

29:49.221 --> 29:51.323
at the Jordan Speedway
every first Sunday of the month.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.859
He goes there
with his car club.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.126
I thought
his car was deactivated.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.962
The new ones, not his classics.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.064
He left here in one a few
minutes before you got here.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.366
What highway?
He takes Cherry Hill

30:00.432 --> 30:02.268
so he can really open it up.
What is going on?

30:02.334 --> 30:05.271
Maloney is biking
back on Cherry Hill.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.006
That's why there's no
history or motive with him

30:07.073 --> 30:08.040
and Massero.
It's not premeditated.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.475
They're only gonna meet once.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.776
On that road.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.711
We'll never catch up.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.414
Unless we don't take
the road.

30:16.949 --> 30:20.819
(engine whirring)

30:31.563 --> 30:32.865
Hey!

30:32.932 --> 30:34.333
You're that idiot
who passed me

30:34.400 --> 30:36.869
on the curve.
You almost hit me.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.737
Yeah, I was actually aiming
for you.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.807
Oh, that's funny. Hey, why don't
you just take up a hobby

30:41.874 --> 30:43.675
that doesn't guzzle fossil fuel?

30:43.742 --> 30:46.145
Wow.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.547
You just put me
in my place.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.382
You don't want to do this.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.717
Oh, but I do.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.019
(whirring)

30:53.085 --> 30:54.020
You all right?

30:54.086 --> 30:56.355
Slower would be better!

30:57.623 --> 31:00.359
Do you think I'm afraid of you?
No.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.161
I just think
you're a little crazy.

31:02.228 --> 31:05.031
So why don't you back off, man.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.871
I said, "Back off."

31:12.939 --> 31:15.307
(grunting)

31:21.013 --> 31:23.215
MASSERO:
Do you think I'm afraid?!

31:23.282 --> 31:24.483
(grunts)

31:24.550 --> 31:25.551
Stop!
Do you think

31:25.617 --> 31:26.585
I'm afraid?!

31:26.652 --> 31:28.520
(grunts)
No!

31:28.587 --> 31:29.521
(groans)

31:29.588 --> 31:31.457
Stay down!
Both of you. Metro PD.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.026
What the hell
are you doing here?!

31:34.093 --> 31:35.027
Were you following me?!

31:35.094 --> 31:37.096
Stay down.

31:37.163 --> 31:40.466
Mark Massero, you're
under arrest for assault.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.568
TREVOR:
I'm gonna sue your ass.

31:42.634 --> 31:43.669
I'm gonna sue his ass.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.538
Oh, man. This is bad.

31:46.605 --> 31:47.940
Believe me...

31:48.907 --> 31:50.442
...could've been worse.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.944
(panting)

31:52.011 --> 31:57.016
DASH:
"Stock prices plunged after
Narcissus chief, Mark Massero,

31:57.083 --> 31:58.417
"was put on indefinite leave,

31:58.484 --> 32:01.220
following his arrest
for aggravated assault."

32:01.287 --> 32:03.822
He's out on bail.

32:03.889 --> 32:07.193
To our first official win.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.231
(grunts)
I've got

32:12.298 --> 32:15.634
something to, uh,
celebrate the occasion.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.103
It's for you, Dash.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.337
A new phone?

32:18.404 --> 32:19.471
Better.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.440
Since your visions take
on the characteristics

32:21.507 --> 32:23.475
of a febrile seizure,
they're always preceded

32:23.542 --> 32:25.177
by a spike in
body temperature.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.180
I programmed this
to detect the fluctuations

32:28.247 --> 32:30.216
and give a 30-second warning.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.018
(bracelet buzzes quietly)
Like so.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.853
That way, if you're,
you know, at a cocktail party

32:34.920 --> 32:37.089
or something, you can slip away.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.158
Because I go to a lot of those.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.559
(all chuckle)

32:40.626 --> 32:42.528
(buzzing quietly)

32:42.594 --> 32:46.232
Ugh. Damn it. Sorry,
it's a prototype.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.234
Still buggy. Here, let me...

32:48.300 --> 32:50.702
(groaning)
No, I think
it's working just fine.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.472
Mark!

32:53.539 --> 32:55.141
Oh, my God!
What have you done?

32:55.207 --> 32:56.775
Lina, I'm so sorry.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.777
...sorry.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.112
I ruined everything.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.748
Mark! What have you done?

33:04.216 --> 33:05.351
I love you.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.560
Mark!

33:16.728 --> 33:18.864
VEGA: Massero's gonna
hang himself.
DASH: A suicide?

33:18.930 --> 33:20.732
That's not possible. Is it?

33:20.799 --> 33:22.068
Dr. Hineman always said

33:22.134 --> 33:24.203
it wasn't death
you three picked up on,

33:24.270 --> 33:26.072
but the quantum
fallout of two

33:26.138 --> 33:28.140
forces clashing--
a murderer, a victim.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.276
And in English,
that means?
Precogs

33:30.342 --> 33:31.810
don't see suicide.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.312
Someone has to be responsible.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.813
Maybe Arthur has a name.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.315
You give that a shot.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.017
I'm gonna stop a suicide.

33:47.059 --> 33:51.029
(mellow piano music playing,
indistinct conversations)

33:52.198 --> 33:53.799
Excuse me for a moment.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.470
Mr. Parker.

33:58.537 --> 34:03.709
Before I forget, stay away
from Corbin, Kentucky,

34:03.775 --> 34:06.078
with that name. Long story.

34:06.145 --> 34:09.748
We stopped Trevor Maloney from
getting killed by Mark Massero.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.650
Now Massero's gonna
kill himself.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.186
I told you, I'm done helping.
A week ago, we had a deal.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.721
You wanted Vega's help.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.489
What-what changed?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.891
The situation.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.428
A man's life is on the line.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.831
If this is one
of your games...
Enough!

34:29.968 --> 34:31.970
If Agatha won't
tell you, I will.

34:32.037 --> 34:34.005
Tell me what?

34:34.072 --> 34:37.109
She had another vision,
one of the big ones.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.478
And it involved your new friend.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.148
Vega.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.317
She was standing by a milk bath.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.019
Just like Precrime.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.755
They're coming for us, Dash,

34:49.821 --> 34:52.824
and Agatha thinks your new
friend is going to betray us.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.295
No way.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.830
Vega wouldn't do that.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.468
You want to bet
our lives on that?

35:03.535 --> 35:06.205
You're putting us at risk.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.576
(clears his throat)

35:10.642 --> 35:13.179
We need to talk
about this, Dash.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.416
You got a name
for me or not?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.856
Yeah.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.032
What do you want now?

35:34.099 --> 35:37.603
To save his life.
Where is he?

35:48.214 --> 35:51.717
Mark! Baby!

35:52.951 --> 35:54.085
What are you doing?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.053
Get it unhooked...

35:55.120 --> 35:56.422
No! No!

35:56.488 --> 35:58.290
Leave me alone!
(Lina shouts)

35:58.357 --> 36:01.092
It's over, Lina.
I got him, I got him,
I got him, I got him.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.361
It's over. It's all over.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.695
I ruined everything.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.096
It wasn't you.
(gasping)

36:05.163 --> 36:07.032
Did you hear
what she said?

36:07.098 --> 36:09.067
Look, it's not you trying
to kill yourself.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.802
(wheezing)

36:10.869 --> 36:12.671
Somebody else is.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.473
(wheezing)
(gently): There...

36:22.448 --> 36:24.450
VEGA:
Name, please.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.784
Dr. Donald Emory.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.353
And you're a psychiatrist,
correct?

36:27.419 --> 36:28.954
That is correct.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.557
Watch a master paint, Akeela.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.692
I'll go make some popcorn.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.495
VEGA: Is Mark Massero
a client of yours?

36:36.562 --> 36:37.829
Yes.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.398
(door closes)

36:39.465 --> 36:41.233
You gonna piggyback on this?

36:41.300 --> 36:44.636
Do you do couples' therapy?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.372
I'd like to wait for my lawyer.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.107
And why is that, Doctor?

36:49.174 --> 36:52.878
Because the room I'm seated in
is reading my stress indicators.

36:52.944 --> 36:56.282
Microtremors in my voice,
skin conductance,

36:56.348 --> 36:59.451
blush response.
Hey, a repeat customer.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.621
No. I consulted
on the system's installation.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.256
VEGA:
Well, then you know

37:04.323 --> 37:05.557
the results aren't
admissible in court.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.159
I'm not stupid, Detective.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.762
I know that, Doctor.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.132
But I think you manipulated
Mark Massero's TMS treatments.

37:14.199 --> 37:17.002
To do what?
Impair his frontal lobe.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.972
Why would I do that?
So that he couldn't understand
the consequences of his actions.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.541
BLAKE:
He came to you

37:22.608 --> 37:25.644
for help... and you
made him self-destruct.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.879
You made him
lose his job.

37:27.946 --> 37:31.517
I raised his dosage, yes.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.253
He was a self-absorbed
workaholic who was so afraid

37:35.321 --> 37:37.222
to fail, he became catatonic.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.358
He had no interests
outside of his work,

37:39.425 --> 37:42.060
because he feared
the outside world.

37:42.127 --> 37:45.497
Air travel, diseases, spiders.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.299
I helped him change.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.267
Well, you did a good job.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.570
Yeah, your patient
fears nothing.

37:51.637 --> 37:55.240
Driving recklessly,
assaulting strangers.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.743
Even taking his own life.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.412
Excuse me?

38:01.447 --> 38:02.748
(electronic blipping)

38:04.483 --> 38:06.585
MASSERO:
Lina, I'm so sorry.

38:06.652 --> 38:10.021
(sniffles)
I never meant to do this to you.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.557
(sniffles)
To us.

38:11.623 --> 38:15.461
I don't know
what's happening to me.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.964
I ruined everything.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.799
I love you.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.069
It's a suicide message.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.072
He's dead?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.907
We found it with the body.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.878
Which means you will be
charged with murder.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.284
Like you said, Doctor,

38:39.351 --> 38:41.219
you're not a stupid man.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.054
(sensors beeping)

38:43.121 --> 38:44.790
I think it would be a smart idea

38:44.856 --> 38:47.759
for you to cooperate
with us, sooner...

38:47.826 --> 38:49.227
rather than later.

38:49.294 --> 38:52.664
Why did you increase his dosage?

38:52.731 --> 38:54.933
Someone put you up to it?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.167
Pay you?
(rapid beeping)

38:56.234 --> 38:57.636
I want my lawyer.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.170
VEGA:
Maybe a rival

38:59.237 --> 39:00.506
at Narcissus?

39:00.572 --> 39:02.207
Maybe someone on the board
wanted his job.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.676
I'm not going
to say another word.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.645
You don't
have to, Doctor.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.313
Your body just
betrayed you.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.981
(steady tone)

39:13.619 --> 39:15.721
Okay, so, it's got to be
clean, right? Simple.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.423
Remember where
we came from.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.491
So, this report...
MAN:
Eli Winford?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.827
Uh, that's me.
You're under arrest.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.028
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:23.094 --> 39:23.829
Anything you say
can and will

39:23.895 --> 39:25.263
be used against you
in a court of law.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.833
BLAKE: The aggravated assault
charges will be dropped.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.335
You were not responsible
for your actions.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.871
You'll need therapy to get
your brain back to normal

39:32.938 --> 39:35.073
so you don't hurt somebody
or yourself.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.142
You got any referrals?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.144
Mine's going on sabbatical.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.079
(laughs)

39:41.146 --> 39:42.280
Thank you.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.715
Yes, thank you.

39:43.782 --> 39:47.118
Don't thank me.
Thank, uh...

39:47.185 --> 39:48.720
Hawk-Eye.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.191
After Precrime was disbanded,
the Precogs were sent away

39:53.258 --> 39:54.826
to an undisclosed location,

39:54.893 --> 39:57.395
to a quiet life, where
they now live happily

39:57.463 --> 39:58.864
in anonymity.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.066
(students chatting
indistinctly)

40:03.569 --> 40:05.937
VEGA:
Mr. Parker?

40:11.042 --> 40:13.445
What do we owe Arthur
for the name?

40:13.512 --> 40:15.647
He said he'd be in touch.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.750
How you doing?

40:20.018 --> 40:22.454
I'll be honest.

40:22.521 --> 40:25.491
This place is gonna take
some getting used to.

40:25.557 --> 40:28.460
Still thinking
about therapy?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.996
I might just tough it out.

40:31.062 --> 40:35.366
(laughs quietly)

40:35.433 --> 40:38.904
Resemblance
is uncanny.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.740
You saved two lives today,
Akeela.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.575
Most people go
their whole lives

40:43.642 --> 40:45.210
without ever hearing
that said to them.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.879
You'll get used to it.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.779
How's your horse, Charlie?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.982
Where's my money?

41:24.049 --> 41:25.784
In a safe, dry place.
Go get it.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.452
That's not going to happen.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.088
Because I like you, Charlie,
and I don't want to see you die.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.257
Die?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.992
If you take your money,

41:34.059 --> 41:37.095
you'll go to a woman's house
in Glenville,

41:37.162 --> 41:38.764
73 miles from here.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.733
Lauren-something--
I didn't get a last name.

41:41.800 --> 41:45.036
You're not going to be wearing
what you have on now.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.438
Lauren kept
your Naval Academy sweatshirt

41:47.505 --> 41:49.040
because it still
smelled like you.

41:49.107 --> 41:51.409
Some people on this
island are afraid of you.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.378
I'm not one of 'em.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.881
No reason you should be.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.684
A single shot fired
from a SWAT Specs Op rifle

41:58.750 --> 42:01.186
at 200 yards will puncture
the big "N"

42:01.252 --> 42:02.921
on your sweatshirt.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.256
There will be a lot of blood.
No one will know

42:05.323 --> 42:08.059
I'm going to Lauren's because
I'm gonna kill you first.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.596
I'm afraid they've been
tipped off that you're
on your way there.

42:10.662 --> 42:11.897
Fine, I'll go somewhere else.

42:11.963 --> 42:14.065
Jimmy McClintock's?

42:14.132 --> 42:17.736
He'll kill you in your sleep
tonight and take your money.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.571
Some best friend.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.073
(gasps)

42:22.140 --> 42:25.243
Chicago's out, that's for sure.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.813
And now you can't stay
around here anymore.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.681
You've got nowhere to go,
Charlie.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.617
About the only people

42:31.683 --> 42:34.252
who take cash these days
are... criminals.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.625
I'm the only one
who can help you.

42:43.461 --> 42:45.163
What do you want?
