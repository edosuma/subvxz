WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.147
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:03.171 --> 00:04.471
but no one noticed...

00:04.505 --> 00:05.539
(growling)

00:05.573 --> 00:06.716
until they began attacking,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.476
coordinating,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
evolving.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.379
The animals were mutating,

00:11.412 --> 00:13.223
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.115
(screaming)

00:14.148 --> 00:16.484
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.594
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.618 --> 00:20.354
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:20.388 --> 00:22.690
will be thriving once again.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.726
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet

00:25.759 --> 00:27.161
and then repopulate it.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.696
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.729 --> 00:30.498
could be catastrophic,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.342
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.768
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.370
animal experts.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.107
Dariela Marzan, Army Ranger.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.674
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.708 --> 00:43.444
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.477 --> 00:46.647
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.584
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:50.618 --> 00:51.719
for the animals.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.587
Time is running out.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.765
Previously on Zoo...
(Abraham grunts)

00:55.789 --> 00:56.824
Hold your fire.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.226
Who the hell are you?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.127
She's my stepmom.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.261
My name is Allison Shaw.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.130
I'm the Deputy
Secretary of Defense.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.397
And yes,
I was married to Mitch's father.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.143
JACKSON: When I was
saying good-bye to Chloe,

01:06.167 --> 01:07.235
I started crying

01:07.268 --> 01:08.369
black tears.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.879
You're displaying the same
symptomatology as Kovacs.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.705
JACKSON: So I'm evolving.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.341
We still good on our deal?
(gun cocks)

01:13.374 --> 01:15.743
Put a bullet in your head if
you turn into a rage machine?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.845
Yeah, we're good. Good.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.157
'Cause I noticed that you and
Abe are getting pretty close.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.616
If killing you
means saving lives,

01:22.650 --> 01:23.851
there's no choice.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.686
How could Davies create a gas

01:25.719 --> 01:28.489
that targets a gene that
you can't even find?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.667
MITCH: Yeah, he'd have to have
somebody even smarter than me

01:30.691 --> 01:31.525
to figure it out.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.861
The TX-14 gas was
working perfectly

01:33.894 --> 01:35.329
till you sabotaged it.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.864
I think I made myself clear.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.766
I'm not telling you anything

01:38.799 --> 01:40.234
until I see my son.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.103
(baby crying, woman shushing)

01:44.772 --> 01:46.174
(sighs)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.778
(shuddering exhale)

01:54.448 --> 01:55.559
(baby continues crying) Okay.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.584
(woman sighs)

01:57.818 --> 01:58.852
(shushing)

01:59.787 --> 02:00.788
Come on, sweetie.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.525
(trilling growing louder)

02:04.558 --> 02:05.859
(crying stops) That's my girl.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.861
(gasps)

02:09.697 --> 02:11.665
(shushing)

02:11.699 --> 02:12.766
There you go.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.303
Oh.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.538
Okay.

02:17.571 --> 02:18.571
(shushing)

02:21.942 --> 02:24.178
(loud trilling,
woman gasping then screaming)

02:24.212 --> 02:26.280
(baby resumes crying)

02:35.256 --> 02:37.258
â™ª

03:06.987 --> 03:09.957
Thanks to your escapades in
Lisbon, we now have

03:09.990 --> 03:12.460
an eyewitness to the
1895 Courier events.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.362
It's not as if
jellyfish have eyes.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.429
MITCH: No, they don't.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.298
Nor do they have
brains or heats.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.800
What they do have
is immortal cells.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.977
Cells that tell us that this guy

03:21.001 --> 03:23.471
was exposed to a whole
bunch of radiation

03:23.504 --> 03:24.305
back in 1895.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.774
Enough to cause a
genetic mutation.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.309
A mutation that I am calling...

03:28.342 --> 03:29.943
The ghost gene.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.613
Thanks, man,
for stealing my thunder.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.915
Anyway, the ghost gene is
what's causing the Triple Helix

03:34.948 --> 03:36.384
to develop in all the animals

03:36.417 --> 03:37.518
we've seen.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.019
Where does this
radiation come from?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.954
Excellent question, Abraham.

03:40.988 --> 03:44.325
Meet Leonard Pierce.
Pseudo-scientist,

03:44.358 --> 03:46.026
thief, entertainer.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.296
Right after the
X-ray was invented,

03:48.329 --> 03:51.365
Leonard stole the technology,
travelled around the globe

03:51.399 --> 03:53.867
x-raying animals and any people

03:53.901 --> 03:55.636
who were stupid enough
to give him a dime.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.904
Any guesses

03:56.937 --> 03:59.507
where he picked up this vulture?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.008
Argentina?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.543
Wow, you guys are good.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.612
Does this mean that all
Triple-Helix animals are

04:04.645 --> 04:06.856
descended from the ones that
Pierce x-rayed? Even the ants?

04:06.880 --> 04:10.551
Well, I'm guessing the ants got
zapped on accident, but yeah.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.885
DARIELA: What about Kovacs?

04:11.919 --> 04:15.489
Kovacs' great-great-grandfather
lived in Budapest

04:15.523 --> 04:17.325
around the time that
Pierce rolled through.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.326
He must've been
x-rayed by Pierce

04:18.358 --> 04:20.327
and then passed this
ghost gene down to Kovacs.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.894
What about me?

04:21.928 --> 04:25.333
I mean, did my dad have the, uh...
ghost gene?

04:25.366 --> 04:26.876
MITCH: Truth is either
one of your parents

04:26.900 --> 04:28.702
could've given it to you.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.870
I haven't found a link yet

04:29.903 --> 04:31.972
between your ancestors and
Pierce, but...

04:32.005 --> 04:32.806
it's got to be there.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.508
JAMIE: So,
you're saying that some

04:34.542 --> 04:37.010
travelling carnie
grifter from the 1890s

04:37.044 --> 04:39.780
inadvertently invented
the Triple-Helix.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.782
Yeah, that is exactly
what I'm saying.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.026
And if we are
gonna un-invent it,

04:43.050 --> 04:43.984
we've got to find descendants

04:44.017 --> 04:45.886
from everyone of those
animals that he zapped.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.720
ALLISON: Eventually Pierce

04:46.754 --> 04:49.423
set up shop in
Holbeach, England.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.992
But as his animals started
showing troubling side effects,

04:52.025 --> 04:54.328
he closed his doors
and hid his work.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.896
And now,
we are gonna go find it.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.531
ALLISON: We tracked
down Pierce's

04:57.565 --> 04:58.899
last known address.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.009
If you guys can find
the complete list

05:00.033 --> 05:02.970
of animals he x-rayed,
we can stop chasing storms.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.948
We'll know exactly what
animals we need for the cure.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.740
MITCH: Jay on top,

05:06.774 --> 05:08.976
we should be able to do
it in time to save...

05:09.009 --> 05:10.077
everyone.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.645
(intercom beeps)

05:11.679 --> 05:13.679
TROTTER (over intercom):
Wheels down in 20 minutes.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.719
(footsteps echoing)

05:24.024 --> 05:26.827
What are we drinking?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.062
Uh... I'm drinking vodka.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.531
Excellent choice.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.099
MITCH (echoing): Okay
then, me too.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.803
(glasses clinking)

05:38.038 --> 05:40.007
(drink pouring)

05:42.843 --> 05:44.545
MITCH: Life was a lot simpler

05:44.578 --> 05:46.414
last time we were
drinking vodka on a plane.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.049
Yeah, and then the plane
fell out of the sky.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.922
Well, I was referring to
everything pre-sky falling.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.137
Kind of feels like
a lifetime ago.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.005
I mean,
the whole world has changed.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.077
You want to know the worst part?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.980
I thought that drink

06:20.013 --> 06:22.716
was a celebration.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.153
I thought we'd actually won.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.189
The cure worked,
and Reiden was exposed, and...

06:29.222 --> 06:32.893
for once in the
history of the world,

06:32.926 --> 06:34.595
little guy ended up on top.

06:38.566 --> 06:42.102
I was blisteringly naive.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.004
And I won't make
that mistake again.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.774
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna quit?

06:46.807 --> 06:51.144
You getting off the party plane?

06:51.178 --> 06:54.014
No.

06:54.047 --> 06:58.018
No, we-we started
this thing together.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.455
And we're gonna
finish it together.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.057
But...

07:04.091 --> 07:06.560
spoiler alert,

07:06.594 --> 07:07.828
I don't think it ends well.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.810
(clears throat)

07:22.843 --> 07:24.878
So...

07:24.912 --> 07:26.714
you tell her that
we're benching her?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.582
Why would I tell her that?

07:28.616 --> 07:31.719
She's unstable,
you agree that she's a liability.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.988
No, I agree that she's hurting.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.133
So, what, you're gonna kiss
her boo-boos to make it better?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.125
She's a wild card.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.060
Davies is looking
for any opening

07:40.093 --> 07:41.495
to destroy what
we're doing here.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.196
You cannot let her
open that window.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.866
She won't.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.100
She just needs some time.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.669
How much time?

07:48.702 --> 07:51.238
You know, if she hadn't
come sneaking into my zoo,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.173
squawking about Reiden
and bunch of lions,

07:53.206 --> 07:54.107
I wouldn't even be here.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
So?

07:55.843 --> 07:56.877
What's that mean?

07:56.910 --> 08:01.048
So that means she gets as
much time as she needs.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.150
And I'm done talking about it.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.151
Time for lights out.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.153
Lights out?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.254
Really?

08:07.287 --> 08:09.690
Because if the Mitch I once
knew heard you say that,

08:09.723 --> 08:11.258
he would call you a...

08:12.292 --> 08:13.994
He'd be very disappointed.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.630
One more drink.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.532
I'll show you where I
hide the good stuff.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.206
(door closing)

08:37.751 --> 08:39.251
(alarm blaring)

08:39.285 --> 08:40.854
Jackson?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.623
Where are you going?

08:42.655 --> 08:43.957
(car door opens, shuts)

08:43.991 --> 08:45.993
(engine starts up) Jackson!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.995
(tires squealing)

08:50.297 --> 08:51.732
That's it, I'm going to bed.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.167
Is that an invitation? (gulps)

08:54.201 --> 08:56.269
(footsteps approaching)
DARIELA: We have a problem.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.107
A few problems maybe.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.075
Jackson just took off
in one of the trucks.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.294
MITCH: Jackson?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.296
Stay back. Let me handle this.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.932
(shoveling dirt)

09:26.399 --> 09:28.235
Jackson, what are you doing?
Huh?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.303
We have to bury Chloe!

09:30.337 --> 09:31.304
(grunts softly)

09:31.338 --> 09:33.674
(shoveling continues)

09:33.707 --> 09:34.908
Jackson. (grunts)

09:34.942 --> 09:36.944
(both breathing heavily)

09:36.977 --> 09:37.778
Jackson...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.188
We have to bury
her, you understand?

09:39.212 --> 09:40.614
We have to bury Chloe. Jackson,

09:40.648 --> 09:43.116
we sent her body back to France.
No, no, no.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.084
Her family's going to bury her.
(muttering indistinctly)

09:44.117 --> 09:48.188
Remember! Rafiki!
We have to bury her.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.056
Come back to me.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.225
All Good Children
Are Growing Teeth.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.762
(repeating): All Good
Children Are Growing Teeth.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.634
What? All Good Children...

10:00.668 --> 10:02.812
Are Growing Teeth.
All Good Children Are Growing Teeth.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.938
He's not making any sense.
MITCH: Yes, he is.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.940
I know exactly what he's saying.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.943
All Good Children
Are Growing Teeth.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.212
That's the key to everything.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.648
JACKSON: All Good Children
Are Growing Teeth.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
(clattering)

10:28.762 --> 10:30.363
You are losing
control of your crew.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.235
He's becoming a danger to
himself and to this mission.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.870
That's my call.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.006
You put me in charge,
let me be in charge.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.084
So you, in good conscience,
are saying that he's fine?

10:41.108 --> 10:43.010
I'm saying I can handle it.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.244
(clattering continues)

10:44.277 --> 10:45.412
I have to go to London

10:45.445 --> 10:46.413
for a few days.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.882
I'm trying to sway a few
of the British IADG reps

10:48.916 --> 10:50.117
away from the Noah Objective.

10:50.150 --> 10:54.021
When I get back,
we'll revisit Jackson.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.655
And Jamie.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.033
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.951
All right. What...
what the hell are you...

11:15.108 --> 11:16.243
What are you doing?

11:16.276 --> 11:19.947
Now you don't have to worry
about me wandering off again.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.015
Oh, so you think
a tracking chip...

11:22.049 --> 11:23.984
A poorly placed
one, I might add...

11:24.017 --> 11:25.228
Is gonna keep me from worrying.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.788
Mitch, it's been a long
night, okay?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.089
Need you to look at this.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.028
(laughs) What,

11:35.062 --> 11:37.106
so you can just rub it in my
face that I'm losing my mind?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.507
You don't have to,
Mitch, I'm aware.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.467
Oh, I don't think
you're losing your mind.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.003
In fact, I think we might have
found something in your mind.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.080
I think what happened tonight

11:44.104 --> 11:47.140
is some kind of
dissociative fugue,

11:47.174 --> 11:50.510
and it-it may have erased
some recent memories,

11:50.543 --> 11:53.013
but I-I think it may
have surfaced some other,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.414
more remote ones.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.117
"All Good Children
Are Growing Teeth."

11:57.150 --> 11:58.118
We both know that's a mnemonic.

11:58.151 --> 11:58.952
It's a genetic sequence.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.421
That's not just any
genetic sequence.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.024
That's the first six
nucleotides of the ghost gene.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.160
And you're gonna
tell me the rest.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.495
Uh...

12:08.528 --> 12:10.097
I-I-I don't know it.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.098
Oh, come on.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.232
Y-You've seen this before.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.301
Okay? Your dad was neck
deep in this stuff.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.503
Maybe-maybe he knew it,
maybe he showed it to you.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.972
But when we were talking
earlier, about the gene,

12:19.006 --> 12:20.974
that triggered something,
some kind of memory.

12:21.008 --> 12:21.975
(sighs)

12:22.009 --> 12:24.144
Whatever it triggered is gone.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.288
If the animals
have the ghost gene

12:25.312 --> 12:27.915
and so do I, why don't you
just get it from our DNA?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.116
Yeah, well, I'm trying.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.452
But the human genome contains
about three billion base pairs

12:32.485 --> 12:34.988
and upwards of 30,000 genes.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.190
And with your bonus helix,
that makes it a lot more.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.392
Okay?
I'm running sequencing software

12:39.426 --> 12:41.461
around the clock,
but we are running out of time.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.039
Well, what happens
if you can't find it?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.132
The cure's like a bomb.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.001
One that's gonna nuke
the Triple-Helix. Okay?

12:48.035 --> 12:49.536
And the sequence
is like an address.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.904
If I don't have that address,

12:50.938 --> 12:52.381
I have no idea where
to deliver the bomb.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.474
So without the sequence,
the cure's useless.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.444
Are you ready to go?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.012
No. Yeah.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.450
You're the only one who
can help me with this.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.254
You know what, Abe?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.564
We're gonna...
we're gonna hang back.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.223
Is everything okay?

13:10.257 --> 13:11.491
Peachy.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.160
Yeah. It'll be even peachier

13:13.193 --> 13:15.353
once you get to Pierce's and
find that list of animals.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.167
Okay.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.811
Pierce's place is
just down the street.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.454
(hatch door closes)

13:41.488 --> 13:42.289
What's with the windows?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.357
ABRAHAM: Barricaded
from the inside.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.960
That's not one
we've seen before.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.229
I've got one to up it.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.531
Up there, 12 o'clock.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.967
(growling)

13:54.001 --> 13:57.037
(roars)

13:57.070 --> 13:59.239
I don't think pillows
are gonna do much good

13:59.272 --> 14:01.875
against those guys.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.577
(sobbing)

14:07.247 --> 14:09.382
(grunts, groans)

14:09.416 --> 14:11.919
DARIELA: Yo! You forgot something!
ABRAHAM: Are you all right?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.120
You okay?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.387
(child gasping)

14:14.421 --> 14:16.123
W-We really should
get inside now.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.558
(high-pitched buzzing) Geez.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.559
Ah!

14:19.592 --> 14:21.394
LOGAN: What is that?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.462
Let's get out of here!

14:22.495 --> 14:23.563
Run! Move!

14:31.138 --> 14:32.105
(cicadas thudding against doors)

14:32.139 --> 14:33.540
Follow me!

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
Bobby. (Muttering)

14:43.483 --> 14:44.651
(projector whirring)

14:44.684 --> 14:46.086
MAN: Where is El?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.220
MAN 2: She's safe.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.388
MAN: Where?

14:50.657 --> 14:52.592
What did they do to her?

14:52.625 --> 14:55.162
MAN 2: Nothing.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.372
MAN: Men don't look the
way you look for nothing.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.098
Where are we?

14:58.131 --> 15:00.633
MAN 2: I saw the men.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.336
I saw them as they really are.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.405
Horrible.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.242
We call this cognitive
repression reversal.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.945
See, your brain is like
a rusty old file cabinet.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.181
It just needs a little
grease on the hinges,

15:14.214 --> 15:15.591
and memories come
popping right out.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.583
By "grease,"

15:16.616 --> 15:19.152
you mean... Cholinesterase.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.587
It's a sedative.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.189
Hypnotic.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.724
Who says we never do
anything fun together, huh?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.960
Okay, you ready?

15:26.994 --> 15:27.961
(sighs) No.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.162
All right.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.733
Really?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.502
I thought you'd just
ignore what I want.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.304
Well, of course I did.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.897
Hit the button, like,
three seconds ago.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.707
(sighs)

15:42.075 --> 15:43.075
So how fast...

15:45.312 --> 15:47.214
(sighs)

15:47.247 --> 15:49.216
Just breathe.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.351
Think about your father.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.986
Think about any time that he

15:53.020 --> 15:54.321
mentioned genetics.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.655
(panting)

15:55.688 --> 15:58.325
He didn't talk about genetics.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.659
M-M-Mostly biology.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.295
Maybe he had the sequence
written down somewhere.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.199
He didn't leave papers
laying around his lab.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.400
Just the office, and...

16:07.434 --> 16:10.137
(sighs heavily)

16:10.170 --> 16:12.639
I wasn't allowed in there.

16:15.542 --> 16:19.212
(groaning)

16:19.246 --> 16:20.313
All right.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.548
Just relax.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.041
Where's Felix?

16:48.075 --> 16:50.177
I told you not to
name the animals.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.544
They're tools, they're not pets.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.314
I know that but, just...
what did you do with him?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.467
Come here, I need your help.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.786
Felix?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.321
What are the cranial nerves?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.329
Come on.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.498
On old Olympus' towering tops,

17:11.531 --> 17:14.201
a Finn and German use some hops.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.268
What does that mean?

17:15.301 --> 17:18.105
Olfactory, optic,

17:18.137 --> 17:20.039
oculomotor. Good.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.343
(exhales)

17:23.376 --> 17:24.477
What is it?

17:24.511 --> 17:25.612
What did you see?

17:27.480 --> 17:28.815
A ghost.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.320
She's safe as long as
you don't interfere!

17:33.353 --> 17:36.323
I've seen some bizarre things
on my journey, but this...

17:36.356 --> 17:38.658
takes the cakes and
all the candles.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.793
LOGAN: Why are they here?
Why not sleep at home?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.495
DARIELA: They can't.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.331
According to the
kid and his mom,

17:44.364 --> 17:46.342
those bugs have been making
that noise for two weeks.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.268
That must be torture.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.346
If it has been going on that
long, why haven't they left?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.472
Some did. And some tried.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.674
They're just so tired they're
not thinking straight.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.885
Plus, they never know when the
bugs are gonna make their noise.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.446
No one knows when
it's safe to go out.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.513
What do you mean, safe?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.349
Those panthers we saw?

18:02.382 --> 18:03.859
Those aren't the
only animals in town.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.885
When the bugs sound,
the animals attack.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.854
The cicadas are behaving like

18:07.887 --> 18:10.390
a dinner bell for the animals.
(scratching sound)

18:10.423 --> 18:11.258
It's the dog.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.593
He's scratching at
the damn door again.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.695
Anyone else think the quicker
we find Pierce's place

18:15.728 --> 18:16.872
and get out of here, the better?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.331
OLD WOMAN: Oh, fine!

18:18.365 --> 18:19.332
I'll let him in, then.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.868
I'm the only one that
does anything around here.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.570
Rosie! Wait!

18:23.603 --> 18:24.804
(Rosie screams)

18:24.837 --> 18:25.905

18:25.938 --> 18:28.508

18:35.715 --> 18:37.450

18:37.484 --> 18:39.786

18:39.819 --> 18:43.523
Come on! Go over there!
Everyone in the sanctuary!

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
Let's go, let's go!

18:45.492 --> 18:47.194
(gunshots, growling)

18:48.295 --> 18:49.629
(gunshots)

18:53.500 --> 18:55.635
Let's go.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.770
(growls)

18:57.804 --> 18:59.672
ABRAHAM: I'm out of tranqs.
I'm out!

19:09.416 --> 19:12.185
(indistinct chattering)

19:12.219 --> 19:15.422
Everyone's out.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.856
I'm sorry about Rosie...

19:16.889 --> 19:19.192
You're from Reiden
Global, aren't you?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.193
Not exactly.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.194
Is everyone okay?

19:21.228 --> 19:23.196
Yes, thanks to you.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.331
JAMIE: Wait, hold up.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.932
You thought we were with Reiden.
Why?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.567
Well, they were here. Last week.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.369
At first, we thought it was

19:29.402 --> 19:31.471
the military,
finally coming to get us.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.349
It soon became clear they
were after something else.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.309
They cleared out one
of the houses in town.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.211
You've heard that old saying,

19:38.245 --> 19:39.846
"everything but
the kitchen sink"?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.214
Yeah, sure.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.550
Well, these guys took
the kitchen sink.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.186
God isn't the only
one always watching.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.525
That's outside
Pierce's old place.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.869
LOGAN: Are they
carrying a lead box?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.728
It could be the X-rays.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.273
DARIELA: Does that mean they
know about Pierce's animals?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.865
How can they be ahead of us?

19:58.898 --> 20:01.401
What difference does it make?
They win again.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.670
The articles that
Mitch told us about.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.338
Some of them said that Pierce

20:05.372 --> 20:06.839
came back to Holbeach

20:06.873 --> 20:08.275
with some of the animals.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.609
They could still be here.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.944
You think they're all
immortal, like the jellyfish?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.247
No, but look at these boxes.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.791
They're big enough
for pictures of bones,

20:15.815 --> 20:17.750
but what about the
bones themselves?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.952
They could still be
hidden somewhere in town.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.421
Then I might be
able to help you.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.422
Father Pete.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.023
Clarence fainted.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.992
Uh...

20:28.761 --> 20:30.930
DARIELA: You show them
what you have on Pierce.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.565
I'll make sure
everyone's patched up.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.966
I'll help.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.474
MITCH: Just remember,
these are your memories.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.810
You're in control.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.677
Control? Yeah, right.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.954
Because I've had so
much of that lately.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.948
Come on. Let's just do this.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.952
(sedative whooshes)

20:52.985 --> 20:55.522
I need you to forget about
the lab for a second.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.690
Focus on your dad's office.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.893
Maybe you overheard what
he was working on in there.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.962
Hard not to overhear him.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.300
ROBERT: What if,
all across the globe,

21:07.334 --> 21:10.670
the animals decided, "No more"?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.839
What if they finally decided

21:12.872 --> 21:14.407
to fight back?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.843
JACKSON: The more tapes he made,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.978
the less we saw of him.

21:19.011 --> 21:23.015
He just started getting
consumed by his work.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.054
He started to go down
a very dark path.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.690
Are we talking
about human testing?

21:30.723 --> 21:33.893
"Testing" makes it
sound more legitimate.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.563
I saw the tests they
did on the animals,

21:36.596 --> 21:39.332
and this was...
this was gonna be different.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.737
Other people must've realized
it, too,

21:44.771 --> 21:46.773
'cause there was a... accident.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.042
At least,
that's what the police called it.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.780
No!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.350
He was never the
same after that.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.388
The fire not only took his lab,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.923
it took his sanity.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.958
It took his credibility.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.431
It took him away from us.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.902
(birds squawking)

22:18.471 --> 22:20.673
We all followed your search
for the cure in the news.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.151
Your team has been at the top of
our prayer list for some time.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.777
Yeah,
how's that working out for you?

22:24.811 --> 22:26.446
Pretty well, I'd say.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.948
You're here, aren't you?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.450
(door opens)

22:33.152 --> 22:35.154
Oh...

22:35.187 --> 22:37.824
If Reiden didn't find any
bones at Pierce's house,

22:37.857 --> 22:40.393
perhaps he owned another
property to hide them in.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.629
These books contain
all the local records

22:42.662 --> 22:44.831
dating back to the 1700s.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.400
Births, deaths,
everything in between.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.536
Fire up the DeLorean.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.444
â™ª

23:00.880 --> 23:03.450
As you were, Sergeant Mansdale.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.485
Sir, the professor's
asking about his son.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.719
He's refusing to continue.

23:06.753 --> 23:07.796
Tell him I'm working on it.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.997
Do we have an update
on the Ranger?

23:09.021 --> 23:12.058
It appears Lieutenant Dariela
Marzan is still with the team.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.426
We need to rectify that.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.628
Can't have a repeat of Lisbon.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.163
What would you like me to do?

23:17.196 --> 23:20.667
Reach out to our asset.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.702
Thanks.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.910
Shaw gave me the name of a
contact near a safe zone.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.087
They can take
everyone from town.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.113
That's great.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.882
It's 80 miles away.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.450
They can't send rescue vehicles.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.619
(sighs)

23:39.652 --> 23:42.154
No chance these people
can make that trek.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.123
They'll be a
walking smorgasbord.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.926
I did a few jobs with a
guy in the British SAS.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.195
Maybe he could
pull a few strings.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.430
Get us an evac.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.537
Knock, knock. No.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.905
(sighs)

24:02.609 --> 24:03.776
No dice.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.945
Number's been disconnected.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.618
Does that mean nobody's
coming to help us?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.217
I'm sorry, buddy.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.919
But you're here now.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.186
Why can't you just help us?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.925
Look, kid.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.026
I can't stay.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.628
I've got a job to do.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.062
What's your job?

24:25.197 --> 24:26.766
I have a sick friend,

24:26.799 --> 24:29.502
who needs me to be there
to take care of him

24:29.536 --> 24:30.803
if he gets worse.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.239
So, your job is to
help sick people?

24:33.272 --> 24:35.174
My job is to keep people safe.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.281
BOBBY: Okay.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.483
He must need your
help more than we do.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.663
There's nothing
useful in this one.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.697
This is pointless.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.907
We're not gonna find anything.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.032
You're probably right.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.934
Isn't it your job

25:01.968 --> 25:03.803
to make people feel
better about the world?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.638
God's plan; everything
happens for a reason?

25:05.672 --> 25:07.540
No.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.084
I'm supposed to help
people navigate the truth,

25:09.108 --> 25:11.177
however harsh.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.279
We've probably lost this battle.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.314
But that's no reason
to stop fighting.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.950
Thin line between
brave and stupid.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.853
Yes, and that thin
line is called "hope."

25:20.887 --> 25:23.055
You were created for
something bigger.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.667
And you owe it to the
world to get on with that.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.726
Okay, there is nothing bigger.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.561
We live, we die... that's it.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.863
The key to life these days

25:30.897 --> 25:33.666
is just to not have it be ended
by some kind of frenzied animal.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.736
Jamie,
you can't really believe that.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.070
Hey, as far as I can tell,

25:38.104 --> 25:39.772
we're on our own down here.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.674
And we're screwing it all up.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.875
(groans)

25:42.909 --> 25:44.276
Sorry.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.845
ABRAHAM: It's okay.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.315
(grunts)

25:54.220 --> 25:57.356
When looking for a
needle in a haystack,

25:57.389 --> 26:01.160
what does Mitch say?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.796
"Best place to hide a needle

26:03.830 --> 26:05.965
is in a stack of needles."

26:05.998 --> 26:10.369
See, Pierce bought a
plot at Holbeach Cemetery

26:10.402 --> 26:13.039
back in 1901

26:13.072 --> 26:15.341
to bury his brother, George.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.314
FATHER PETE: Pierce
was an only child.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.887
And to think,
if you hadn't knocked over those books,

26:27.920 --> 26:29.388
we wouldn't have had this idea.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.024
God always works...

26:32.058 --> 26:35.962
If you say "mysterious ways,"
I will punch you in the face.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.997
Let's go rob a grave.

26:48.775 --> 26:52.111
I know you don't want to hear
this, but...

26:52.144 --> 26:54.714
I'm starting to realize why
your dad went off the deep end.

26:54.747 --> 26:58.284
We lost one cure already.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.719
If somebody trashed
all our work,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.654
that be enough to
loosen my screws.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.056
It wasn't a happy time
in the Oz household.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.160
So, what?

27:08.194 --> 27:10.296
Did he start bringing
his work home with him?

27:10.329 --> 27:13.399
After that,
rage is all he brought home with him.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.267
Rage.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.269
I had to get the
hell out of there.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.239
Call them, Mom.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.141
You have to take the job.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.919
What about school?
What about all your friends?

27:23.943 --> 27:25.978
They have schools in Botswana.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.847
I'll make friends
with the elephants.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.916
We have to get away from him.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.018
Okay, I'll make the call.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.386
Now, you're gonna have to help
me pack up all our things.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.388
I got to look for our
passports, 'cause I think

27:36.422 --> 27:37.857
your father hid them.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.326
Dad had the passports
in his office.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.428
They burned in the fire.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.197
Okay, I'll organize new ones.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.299
We can't tell your father.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.300
ROBERT: Jackson!

27:48.334 --> 27:50.236
(gasps)

27:52.338 --> 27:54.116
You said you were never
allowed in your dad's office.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.474
I wasn't.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.110
So, how did you know
where the passports were?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.213
I don't know.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.283
(bell tolling)

28:07.286 --> 28:09.255
We have a lead.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.389
You ready to go?

28:10.422 --> 28:13.325
Actually, I need to talk to you.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.903
Before today,

28:23.936 --> 28:26.806
the last time I was in a church
was for my father's funeral.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.941
I'm sorry.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.977
How long?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.913
Three years ago last week.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.447
Last week.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.216
You never mentioned it.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.120
Not really the mentioning type.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.156
I've noticed.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.058
The church was packed.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.161
Everyone who ever served
with him was there.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.898
Even people who only
heard stories about him.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.303
He was a hell of a soldier.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.338
That's all he was.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.809
I want to be more.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.178
You are.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.549
I've spent so much of my
life with blood on my hands.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.752
I'm tired of hiding
behind my gun.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.289
I have to go.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.159
I'm going to help these
people get to safety.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.863
And then, rejoin us?

29:25.231 --> 29:27.834
If I get back on that
plane with your team,

29:27.867 --> 29:30.269
I'll be making the same
mistake all over again.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.371
It's your team, too.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.374
You're not just
another soldier to us.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.380
Jackson asked me to kill him.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.354
If his mutation goes too far.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.422
If there's a chance he
might hurt any of you.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.593
Jackson wouldn't hurt any of us.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.028
(quiet laugh)

29:56.062 --> 29:57.363
You don't know him.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.032
You didn't know Kovacs.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.339
Jackson knows none of
you can pull the trigger.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.176
But I'm a soldier.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.846
If I get back on that
plane, I'm choosing death.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.483
And I need to choose life.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.439
(hisses)

30:40.472 --> 30:41.908
You told me you
were never allowed

30:41.941 --> 30:43.051
in your dad's office. I wasn't.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.020
I don't know why I said the
thing about the passports.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.445
I was never in his office.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.514
I know you want to believe that.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.125
Hey, if you think I'm lying,
then just say it, huh?

30:50.149 --> 30:51.226
Come out and say it.
Don't patronize me.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.485
I don't think you're lying.
I think you're repressing.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.287
Freud called it
"screening," okay?

30:55.321 --> 30:57.199
You're protecting yourself from
a potentially painful memory.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.925
I need a break.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.402
No, no, not right now.
We can't take a break.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.994
Mitch. We're too close.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.172
We cannot take a break right now.
I need a break, Mitch!

31:04.196 --> 31:05.397
I need a break.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.236
Right.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.944
Chloe died trying
to save the world.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.346
You're telling me you can't
face your daddy issues?

31:20.379 --> 31:21.948
(groans)

31:33.559 --> 31:37.429
JACKSON: I'm in my father's lab.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.165
The cages...

31:39.198 --> 31:42.468
the cages are empty.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.271
I... I'm freeing the animals.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.445
I'm in his office.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.347
How did I get in?

32:03.222 --> 32:06.125
I see the passports.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.529
They're on fire.

32:13.699 --> 32:14.967
The gene sequence.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.535
It's on the wall.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.705
The wall is burning.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.208
Everything's on fire.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.244
Who started the fire?

32:39.358 --> 32:41.627
I'm the one that burned
down my dad's lab.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.496
All of his research.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.665
His whole life's work.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.503
Because of me.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.505
And I...

32:53.539 --> 32:57.243
I thought that I was saving him.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.045
Keeping him from
crossing the line.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.586
But all I did was ruin his
chance at saving the world.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.655
No!

33:39.418 --> 33:42.054
Congratulations.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.089
You were right.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.760
Sorry.

33:50.696 --> 33:54.066
What are you sorry for?

33:54.100 --> 33:56.268
I'm the one that
destroyed everything.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.186
There's over 400
people still here.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.587
Four need medical care,

34:15.621 --> 34:17.656
14 kids.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.427
They have a few hunting rifles,
a couple of cricket bats...

34:21.460 --> 34:23.629
They're kind of like
baseball bats...

34:23.661 --> 34:25.697
And one kid said
he had a crossbow.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.367
Are you sure you
want to do this?

34:32.404 --> 34:33.648
Wouldn't trusts
these sleepwalkers

34:33.672 --> 34:34.639
with weapons, anyway.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.242
And Father Pete
will be here soon.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.349
Stay with Jamie.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.417
I see how you look at her.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.661
You were in the
trenches together,

34:46.685 --> 34:47.585
you can't break that bond.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.620
Hold on to it.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.322
Is it really that obvious?

34:51.357 --> 34:52.623
Hot tip?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.193
You should avoid poker.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.495
(chuckles)

34:56.527 --> 34:57.529
Will do.

34:57.563 --> 35:01.400
Well, you be careful out there.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.670
Remember, it's not just the
animals that are after us.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.712
Listen up!

35:13.745 --> 35:15.547
We're getting out of here.

35:15.581 --> 35:19.218
You have to go home and gather
everything you can carry.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.720
Water, food, medication.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.822
Anything you'll need
for the next week.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.692
Meet back here at 4:00 p.m.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.694
Tell your neighbors,
tell your friends.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.467
JAMIE: We need to hurry.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.470
The cicadas have been quiet,
we don't want to be out in the open

35:38.504 --> 35:39.605
when they start up again.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.740
(thud)

35:41.773 --> 35:42.908
(two thuds)

35:42.941 --> 35:44.710
(grunts)

35:44.743 --> 35:46.178
(wood creaking)

35:46.212 --> 35:47.713
(both grunting)

35:51.750 --> 35:52.750
(bones clacking)

35:55.654 --> 35:57.323
Jackpot.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.396
This is just what we need.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.610
If the professor knew Reiden
left these bones here,

36:08.634 --> 36:09.601
he'd be furious.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.636
What professor?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.638
Professor Oz, I believe.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.540
He was in charge
of the Reiden men

36:14.573 --> 36:15.607
who came for the X-rays.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.675
Oz? Robert Oz?

36:16.708 --> 36:18.810
Robert Oz is dead.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.612
Did Reiden tell you to say this?

36:20.646 --> 36:21.947
What? Wh...

36:21.980 --> 36:23.449
(cicadas trilling loudly)

36:23.482 --> 36:25.317
Let's go. Let's go.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.433
That was close.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.837
Abraham,

36:45.871 --> 36:48.440
I'm sorry if what I said
about Professor Oz upset you,

36:48.474 --> 36:49.884
I had no idea it
would mean anything.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.978
Do you have any proof?

36:53.011 --> 36:54.613
The pictures on your phone

36:54.646 --> 36:56.715
of the team Reiden sent.

36:56.748 --> 36:58.717
That's Professor Oz
in the driver's seat.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.851
JAMIE: That could be him.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.787
What does this mean?
Did he fake his death?

37:01.820 --> 37:02.988
I have no idea.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.393
Dariela's gearing up to
go, Father.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.394
You ready?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.562
I'm fine.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.797
Just fine. (trunk closes)

37:11.830 --> 37:12.798
Hey.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.300
Thank you for all of your help.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.643
I wasn't always like
this, you know.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.802
I used to have...

37:16.835 --> 37:19.571
hope, but lately,

37:19.605 --> 37:21.440
hope has kind of felt
like a cruel joke.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.976
Well,
if you really feel that way,

37:25.010 --> 37:27.513
should I cross you
off our prayer list?

37:29.415 --> 37:30.749
Nah, knock yourself out.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.954
(car door opens)

37:52.771 --> 37:54.540
(sighs)

37:59.044 --> 38:01.513
No! Let me say
good-bye to my son.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.088
Africa, huh?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.990
Well, you're gonna miss
a lot of Sox games.

38:13.859 --> 38:14.860
Jackson...

38:21.600 --> 38:22.810
(whispering): I know it was
you, Jackson.

38:22.834 --> 38:26.304
I know you burned down my lab.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.359
(alarm blaring)

38:55.166 --> 38:58.770
Hey, Logan,
can you give Jamie and I a moment?

38:58.804 --> 38:59.805
See you inside.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.978
It's about what
Father Pete said.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.714
We cannot tell Jackson.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.750
Abe, if there is even a chance
that Jackson's dad is alive,

39:11.783 --> 39:12.884
we have to tell him.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.753
No, if we tell him
his dad is alive,

39:14.786 --> 39:16.422
and it turns out to be a lie,

39:16.455 --> 39:18.457
it will only
unravel him further.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.891
Trust me, I know Jackson.

39:19.925 --> 39:23.562
Until we know the truth,
we cannot tell him anything.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.564
We cannot tell anyone.

39:25.597 --> 39:26.765
Okay, fine.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.779
My father knew.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.449
Gonna need a little
more context.

39:43.482 --> 39:46.184
He knew I burned down his lab.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.920
I remembered,
he approached me about it.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.689
Confronted me before
I left for Africa.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.428
Um...

39:56.462 --> 39:57.863
Look, you were,
you were just a kid.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.707
No, Mitch, look.
I'm sure your dad had a good...

39:59.731 --> 40:01.767
He, he gave some
sort of injection.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.868
Some sort of shot.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.471
I always thought
it was a birthmark.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.072
But now...

40:11.677 --> 40:13.078
Well, that would explain it.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.447
Explain what?
Remember when I said

40:15.481 --> 40:17.024
that I couldn't determine
which one of your parents

40:17.048 --> 40:19.885
you inherited the
ghost gene from?

40:19.918 --> 40:22.888
That was because there was
anomalous material in your DNA,

40:22.921 --> 40:24.890
which I thought was
just an inconsistency

40:24.923 --> 40:26.825
in the, in the test
method, but...

40:26.858 --> 40:29.528
if the methodology was sound...

40:29.561 --> 40:30.896
What are you saying?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.197
(sighs)

40:33.765 --> 40:36.001
Maybe you didn't
inherit the gene.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.969
Maybe...

40:38.003 --> 40:40.105
somehow your dad

40:40.138 --> 40:43.041
created a synthetic version of
it, and he...

40:44.610 --> 40:45.811
injected you with it.

40:45.844 --> 40:49.080
You're saying that
my father did this?

40:49.114 --> 40:51.182
That everything that I

40:51.216 --> 40:54.986
am going through
is because of him?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.054
Why would he do that?

40:56.087 --> 40:57.222
(sighs)

41:06.632 --> 41:08.634
(indistinct conversations)

41:12.604 --> 41:14.039
Where the hell is everyone?

41:26.084 --> 41:27.185
FATHER PETE: They're ready.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.854
Lead the way.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.059
Walk in pairs or small groups.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.961
Stay hydrated.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.830
If you see an animal,
pass that info up the line

41:38.864 --> 41:40.666
to those of us with weapons.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.801
Let's move out!

41:46.772 --> 41:47.773
You again.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.276
Knock knock.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.144
Who's there?

42:06.157 --> 42:07.325
(phone beeps)

42:07.358 --> 42:09.895
(line ringing)

42:14.065 --> 42:15.734
It's me.

42:15.767 --> 42:16.735
MAN: Where do we stand?

42:16.768 --> 42:17.836
Ranger's gone.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.571
Didn't even have to
get my hands dirty.

42:19.605 --> 42:21.807
Is Jackson Oz still onboard?
Yeah.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.017
You want me to take care of him?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.876
No, sit tight, I'll be in touch.

42:28.279 --> 42:29.748
Will do, sis.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.182
All right.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.851
Bye.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.620
(phone beeps)

42:34.653 --> 42:36.087
Is everything okay with Abe?

42:36.121 --> 42:39.124
Yeah, everything's fine.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.191
How's your sister?

42:42.093 --> 42:43.094
She's great.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.798
(bottle opens)

42:46.832 --> 42:48.333
(sniffs)
