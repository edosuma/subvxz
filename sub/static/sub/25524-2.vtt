00:01.359 --> 00:03.480
Harriet Lennox,
I want you gone!

00:03.560 --> 00:04.840
If you doubt
your man's affections,

00:04.960 --> 00:05.840
it's not because of me.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.400
‐You've gone your own way,

00:07.480 --> 00:08.800
Margaret, always.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.080
Now I'll go mine.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.160
Lydia Quigley, this is
a warrant for your arrest.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.840
‐Pursue Mrs. Quigley
at your peril.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.760
‐You must have
benefactors somewhere.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.160
‐Lady Fitz.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
<i>Isabella Fitzwilliam,</i>
<i>heiress of Blayne.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.640
<i>The finest jewel of all.</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:27.480
‐You're speaking
against Mrs. Quigley?

00:27.520 --> 00:28.480
I can help you.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.160
<i>‐One day she'll let down</i>
<i>her guard.</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:32.560
When I'm done, Mrs. Quigley
will be dust and ash.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.640
I'll speak but no one
can know it came from me.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.320
‐We've got her.
‐Fuck me.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.400
<i>‐No, don't, Mrs. Wells, please.</i>

01:50.480 --> 01:52.680
<i>Don't hurt her,</i>
<i>leave her alone.</i>

01:55.480 --> 01:58.840
‐Ma?
‐I'm fixing her up for the wake.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.840
Take Fanny upstairs.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.120
Stitch that child with silk
and a gold needle.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.120
She'll still be dead.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.120
Struck down by Quigley.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.840
We can't be certain.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.880
We were coursing her
like a hare.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.680
She threw us
that rotten swine's heart

02:25.800 --> 02:27.400
in a bid to stop the hunt.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.400
I wish I'd heeded it.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.400
What will we tell
the magistrate?

02:37.520 --> 02:40.080
We've no proof
to link her to Kitty,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.840
and the molly boy
has scurried in fear.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.800
‐We've still got Emily Lacey.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.440
Her balls are bigger
than the molly's.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.280
‐If Kitty was here, she'd
tell you not to cry for her.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.880
‐No!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.680
She'd say, "Look at what
they've done to me.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.560
Why in God's name are
you sat on your arse?"

03:05.600 --> 03:06.560
‐Fanny!

03:10.680 --> 03:12.520
Fanny's gone off in a state.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.280
‐She's lost a friend.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.360
They're scarcer
than hens' teeth.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.120
She'll be back
before Mercy needs to suckle.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.960
‐Come on.
‐Where are you going?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.840
‐To clean our hands.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.120
‐Has my fine been met?
‐It has not.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.520
Violet Cross.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.280
‐My girl could be
at your office

03:52.400 --> 03:53.680
trying to make payment now!

03:53.720 --> 03:54.840
‐Jailer.
<i>‐Madam,</i>

03:54.880 --> 03:56.120
<i>harass the Justice again</i>

03:56.240 --> 03:58.400
<i>and I'll stuff</i>
<i>your mouth with rags.</i>

04:01.120 --> 04:02.680
It'll not be rags.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.360
‐Miss Scanwell thinks
there is something virtuous

04:05.400 --> 04:07.840
at the heart of you.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.400
Is her faith misplaced?

04:10.440 --> 04:14.000
‐I never stole that purse.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.600
My time here is wasted.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.360
‐I care very much for Amelia.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.360
I'd like to one day be
as good as she thinks I am.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.600
‐Come on.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.560
‐I'm interrupting?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.000
‐Nonsense.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.720
You must join us.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.920
‐I've already eaten, thank you.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.480
‐She came for silver,
not spice bread.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.560
I propose...

05:39.600 --> 05:41.000
a little game.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.920
You tell me where
my sister's money is destined,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.920
and we shall discover

05:46.040 --> 05:48.920
if Isabella
has been telling fibs.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.920
‐Humor him please, Miss Wells,

05:51.040 --> 05:52.800
or he'll be impossible.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.240
‐Very well.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.720
The money is to pay a debt.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.040
‐Oh, very good, very good.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.600
What kind?

06:06.720 --> 06:09.920
He makes the game
seem dangerous.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.160
I would rather be rolling dice.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.040
Surely not Hazard,
Lady Isabella.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.600
Not when you already have
this debt to pay.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.280
‐Is that your answer, Hazard?

06:21.360 --> 06:23.120
‐It is.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.480
‐What a pair
of colluding pixies you are!

06:30.600 --> 06:32.280
‐He finds it hard to believe

06:32.360 --> 06:34.800
that I lose so often.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.800
‐He has not seen me play.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.600
‐No matter, ladies.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.600
My sister's luckless at dice,

06:40.680 --> 06:44.120
lucky in love.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.600
I do hope you can forgive
this imposition.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.360
Of course.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.240
‐Never in my life
did I think I'd be glad

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
to see that muckspout.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.040
‐You never said I'd be
hand in glove with her.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.240
‐You share a foe.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.240
‐She threw me to that foe
when it suited her.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.920
‐I'm here for Kitty.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.360
‐What's carrot curls
got to do with anything?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.360
‐She's dead, Emily.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.600
Quigley had her snatched
from the doorstep.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.400
‐She's lying in my kitchen
with her throat torn.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.160
‐The hounds...
‐Emily.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.800
‐You didn't protect her
from the hounds.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.720
‐She was slain before
we knew she'd been taken.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.560
We have a chance
to see Quigley swing.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.720
‐Emily Lacey!
‐Emily!

07:44.400 --> 07:46.840
‐I was coming to see you.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.800
‐Mr. Armitage!

07:55.720 --> 07:57.360
‐You accuse Mrs. Quigley

07:57.480 --> 08:02.360
of commanding murder
from her jail cell?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.840
‐I was warned
not to persecute her.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.400
The pig's heart
was a threat.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.800
‐What p‐proof have you

08:08.840 --> 08:11.480
that this masked man
acted on her behalf?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.240
‐Quigley's history is lined

08:13.280 --> 08:16.040
with abductions and killings.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.600
She caters for beasts
with buckled shoes

08:19.720 --> 08:21.400
and bloody tastes.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.240
What proof?

08:23.360 --> 08:24.840
‐We know a girl

08:24.920 --> 08:26.720
who escaped her,

08:26.800 --> 08:29.000
but she's too scared
to speak out.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.440
Then you have nothing
against Mrs. Quigley.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.600
Have you not heard
our testimony?

08:36.720 --> 08:39.520
I have heard the hearsay
of her enemies.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.640
<i>‐I've never been</i>
<i>to a hanging,</i>

09:00.720 --> 09:04.720
but when you catch the killer,
I will go to his.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.480
‐I wouldn't hold
your breath, Fanny.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.600
There's not enough lawmen
to protect the rich,

09:09.720 --> 09:13.000
let alone avenge
dead street girls.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.240
‐Will you not even try?

09:15.360 --> 09:16.720
For Kitty?

09:19.480 --> 09:23.840
‐Women will always be
at the mercy of men's power.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.240
Best just to look
after yourself.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.840
‐It's not your power
we're at the mercy of.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
It's your weakness.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.440
‐Charlotte?
‐This lady has come

09:46.480 --> 09:48.080
to pay Mrs. Quigley's fine.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.760
‐What are you doing?
‐What I must.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.640
‐Don't you dare fend for her.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.440
‐Kitty Carter was
butchered in the night.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.120
Kitty's dead?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.480
‐As a stone.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.480
A victim of your
fine benefactress.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.360
‐That accusation is unproven.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.360
The only charge that remains
against Mrs. Quigley

10:07.480 --> 10:08.360
is running a brothel.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.720
Now, will you‐‐will you...

10:09.840 --> 10:11.720
pay her penalty or not?

10:11.760 --> 10:15.320
‐On my life, if you do this,

10:15.360 --> 10:17.760
you cease to be mine.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.480
‐You gotta trust me, Ma.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.120
‐Miss Wells?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.120
‐I will.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.360
Please understand.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.240
‐Shame on you, Charlotte Wells.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.600
‐You‐‐you will not
disrespect this court.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.480
‐Shame on you too.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.200
‐You foul bitch!

11:00.240 --> 11:02.120
‐Kitty's death
will not silence us.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.880
‐What is this gibberish?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.760
‐Don't deny my girl
was slain on your orders.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.840
You were always her creature.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.080
Even as a baby,
only she could mollify you.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.640
‐Go home, Ma!

11:15.000 --> 11:17.960
‐You're still sucking honey
from her fingers!

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I've no idea what
they're alluding to.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.720
I never harmed
a single girl in my life.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.120
Please tell me you believe that.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.480
‐I'm...sorry to have kept you.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.120
‐You are busy holding back
a tide of vice, sir.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.840
No mean feat.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.880
‐Oh, let me clear
a space, Mother.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.120
‐I, uh, I am...

12:07.200 --> 12:09.320
yet without housekeeper.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.720
‐You have considered
Violet's case?

12:15.840 --> 12:18.000
‐I spoke to her this morning.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.440
In truth, I can find
little to recommend her.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.120
‐Then you've not looked
hard enough.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
‐Amelia!

12:23.240 --> 12:25.080
‐This girl has flimflammed you

12:25.120 --> 12:27.360
with feigned v‐virtue.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.240
‐This has long been
my suspicion.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.600
‐Then you will not help her.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.240
‐God has just granted me

12:33.320 --> 12:36.480
the most wonderful notion.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.000
Could your need
of a housekeeper

12:39.080 --> 12:40.600
not be met by...

12:40.640 --> 12:42.000
‐Violet!

12:42.080 --> 12:43.600
‐I was about to suggest you,
Amelia.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.640
‐Is Violet's need not greater?

12:46.720 --> 12:50.080
Her servitude could be to you.

12:50.120 --> 12:54.000
‐It's an interesting
proposition.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.640
‐What a gift
your patronage would be.

12:57.720 --> 13:02.080
Violet's path to enlightenment.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.840
‐We have no home,

13:08.880 --> 13:11.600
nor money nor food.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.520
What a spell this girl
has cast on you.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.360
Up!

13:19.480 --> 13:20.440
Slattern!

13:20.480 --> 13:21.600
We need to leave,

13:21.720 --> 13:23.720
and your mumma mustn't know
we were here.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.240
Emily, we've claimed
Golden Square as our own.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.000
We will defend it
like a fortress.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.000
Kitty Carter is dead,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.240
at your mumma's hands!

13:52.360 --> 13:55.320
‐Says who?
‐Margaret Wells!

13:55.360 --> 13:59.120
She told everyone
you were dead once too.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.240
I came that close
I can still feel the chills.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.960
I want to live, Charlie.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.360
Long enough to see
my muff turn silver.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.360
<i>‐Leave me be.</i>

14:34.480 --> 14:36.360
<i>I'll pay for another night.</i>

14:36.480 --> 14:38.520
Mr. North.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.720
It's me, Fanny.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.200
<i>‐Fanny, I know you mean well.</i>

14:43.240 --> 14:44.600
<i>I just want to be left alone.</i>

14:44.640 --> 14:46.600
Something terrible has happened.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.840
‐I should've been there.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.840
‐Mr. Armitage says
young girls are...

14:54.880 --> 14:57.240
murdered all the time.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.240
‐Not in my house.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.360
You may borrow my books
if you please.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.200
Do you think I'd be
a thieving whore

15:25.240 --> 15:26.760
if I could read?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
‐Will this be your,
uh, first experience

15:30.480 --> 15:31.760
of working as a maid?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.240
‐Depends if you count
polishing knobs.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.840
‐I have saved you
from the prison,

15:35.880 --> 15:37.600
and yet you show
no gratitude at all.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.600
‐If I'm not free to leave,
then I'm still in prison.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.240
‐Say the word
and I will return you

15:41.320 --> 15:44.520
to your jail cell
to await transportation.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.240
There's poxy rats
on those prison ships.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.640
I can't be doing with rats.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.120
‐There's port
on your mumma's rug!

16:03.240 --> 16:05.600
‐It's my rug.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.840
Look.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.520
You saddle‐goose!

16:10.600 --> 16:13.720
Don't think I won't leave
without you.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.200
‐I heard of your troubles,
Mumma.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.600
‐Charlie!

16:35.640 --> 16:38.080
I didn't expect you to come.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.000
‐Of course I came.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.120
‐I've journeyed
to hell and back.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.520
But I'd do it again
to have you home.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.000
‐We're going to take care of
everything while you recover.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.720
Sorry, Mrs. Quigley.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.400
We were just tidying up.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.680
You have had a party,

17:12.720 --> 17:15.640
while I festered in a cesspit.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.200
<i>‐Just to keep the girls jolly.</i>

17:20.480 --> 17:22.560
You have laughed
at my misfortune

17:22.680 --> 17:25.000
and prayed I would not return.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.200
‐We did no such thing, Mumma.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.280
‐You have done this.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.200
‐No, no, Mrs. Quigley, no.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.200
‐He was the apple of my eye

17:41.240 --> 17:43.720
until you consumed him,
you maggot!

17:43.800 --> 17:44.720
<i>‐Mumma!</i>

17:44.800 --> 17:46.400
‐Don't you dare address me so!

17:46.480 --> 17:48.680
You've squandered that right!

17:51.280 --> 17:54.560
Here is the child
who came to my side.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.160
Here is my rightful heir.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.720
You have had a house
and a son off of me.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.440
You try to take even more

18:01.480 --> 18:03.880
and I'll cut
your fucking throat!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.680
<i>‐That could've been me.</i>

19:24.960 --> 19:27.160
Only without the crowds
and candles.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.400
No person should ever be
disowned by their mother.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.160
It's unnatural.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.400
‐Is that what you think
most unnatural?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.720
Not raped girls
or slit throats,

19:47.800 --> 19:49.280
just your stubby little fingers

19:49.400 --> 19:50.800
slapped away from Mumma's purse.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.720
‐Emily!
‐Her fortune was earned

19:52.800 --> 19:54.560
stealing souls.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.080
‐Where are you going?
‐To pay my respects.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.040
I'll come.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.160
‐They might lynch you.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.000
I might help 'em.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.480
‐Ale and rage.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.440
It's a potent mix.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.000
It's the cost of you
leaving us vulnerable

20:54.080 --> 20:56.400
while you took your distemper
for a walk.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.240
‐There's no blame
at your doorstep though,

20:58.320 --> 20:59.760
is there, Margaret?

20:59.880 --> 21:02.080
Only bodies.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.760
‐You're choking on guilt.

21:05.880 --> 21:10.320
‐Mary Cooper, George Howard,
Kitty Carter.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.280
There's that many corpses
clinging to your skirts

21:13.400 --> 21:15.280
you're starting to reek.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.400
We're here to raise
our glasses to Kitty Carter!

21:27.800 --> 21:30.760
One of the best girls
I've had in my house!

21:30.880 --> 21:33.680
‐Kitty was innocent!
‐No, she wasn't.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.920
She was guilty...

21:36.000 --> 21:37.480
of being poor.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.320
The worst crime you can commit.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.200
‐And that's why she'll turn
to dust in her grave

21:43.240 --> 21:46.440
while Lydia Quigley
grows old and saggy.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.720
‐If Quigley is the killer,

21:47.800 --> 21:50.000
why did the law let her loose?

21:50.080 --> 21:51.480
‐The law is rigged!

21:51.520 --> 21:53.880
No evidence strong enough
to condemn a white wig,

21:53.960 --> 21:55.880
and none too weak
to hang a whore!

21:57.400 --> 22:00.520
‐Violet Cross is in jail
awaiting transportation.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.000
Great Britain's good riddance.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.640
<i>‐My uncle went that way.</i>

22:03.720 --> 22:05.480
<i>He shouldn't have died</i>
<i>of a fever on the cross</i>

22:05.520 --> 22:06.720
<i>and ended up fish food.</i>

22:06.760 --> 22:09.720
<i>‐Violet Cross is</i>
<i>as light‐fingered as they come!</i>

22:09.760 --> 22:12.240
<i>‐You sell your cunny for coin!</i>

22:12.320 --> 22:14.200
<i>We've all got to do something!</i>

22:14.240 --> 22:15.520
It's because we're poor!

22:15.640 --> 22:18.320
‐How many more of us
are gonna clinch the pillory

22:18.440 --> 22:20.040
or dance with the hangman?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.720
‐Yes, that's true.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.200
‐We are a sewer full of rats

22:25.240 --> 22:28.720
being ruled by
a handful of foxes!

22:28.800 --> 22:31.560
It's time we showed our teeth!

22:31.680 --> 22:32.920
Come on!

22:34.720 --> 22:36.520
‐Everyone out the back, come on!

22:44.400 --> 22:46.280
‐Not our own streets, fool!

22:47.880 --> 22:49.440
To the magistrate's!

22:58.040 --> 23:00.520
‐Breaking windows
won't see you remembered

23:00.640 --> 23:04.160
or keep your daughter fed.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.720
But I will.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.720
It's his, Lucy.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.760
The bastard that killed her.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.440
<i>‐Justice for Kitty Carter!</i>

24:14.240 --> 24:15.920
<i>‐Justice for Kitty!</i>

24:32.440 --> 24:34.000
‐Here lives the law!

24:34.080 --> 24:36.800
Show him what you think
of how he fucking governs us!

24:36.920 --> 24:38.240
‐One rule for the rich,

24:38.280 --> 24:39.440
and one for us!

24:39.480 --> 24:40.800
‐Hey, come and face us!

24:44.160 --> 24:46.000
You lily‐livered fucker!

24:55.000 --> 24:57.520
Show us your face,
you quivering cunt!

25:14.800 --> 25:16.240
<i>‐Come out!</i>

25:23.400 --> 25:25.200
‐You soft‐bellied cowards!

25:25.240 --> 25:27.480
‐You will disperse or face

25:27.560 --> 25:29.160
the full weight of the law!

25:29.240 --> 25:31.280
‐Someone has to pay
for Kitty Carter's murder.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.320
Are you gonna arrest
Lydia Quigley?

25:33.440 --> 25:34.880
N‐not without evidence!

25:34.960 --> 25:37.000
‐We gave you evidence
and you scorned it!

25:37.080 --> 25:39.240
‐Then we'll string her up
ourselves!

25:39.280 --> 25:40.440
‐Yeah!

25:42.440 --> 25:44.160
You leave her, you leave her!

25:44.240 --> 25:46.320
‐You will disperse‐‐Constable!

25:48.760 --> 25:49.880
‐Violet!

25:49.960 --> 25:51.720
Great Justice nothing!

25:51.760 --> 25:53.040
‐Arrest this woman!

25:57.160 --> 25:58.640
<i>Get her to a cell!</i>

25:58.720 --> 26:00.640
<i>Go to your homes!</i>

26:00.720 --> 26:02.440
<i>Take them away!</i>

26:04.400 --> 26:05.720
‐Nancy!

27:09.240 --> 27:11.440
‐Hunt's closed the gallery.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.320
‐We've scared him witless.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.080
‐That's a good thing.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.000
‐No, a frightened man

27:17.080 --> 27:19.520
is a very dangerous thing, Lucy.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.240
‐I need to speak to Charlotte.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.000
‐She isn't here.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.560
This isn't a gated tower.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.240
She comes and goes
as she pleases.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.000
‐Give her a message from her pa.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.880
Does something amuse you?

27:43.960 --> 27:47.640
‐Only a raven claiming
a swan as its issue.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.200
‐I do not claim her.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.000
She calls me Pa willingly.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.720
I hear the names
your boy calls you

27:52.760 --> 27:55.000
would make a mariner blush.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.240
Tell Charlotte

27:59.320 --> 28:01.040
Nancy Birch has been arrested.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.800
She'll want to know.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.000
<i>‐You're saved!</i>

28:21.080 --> 28:22.320
‐Lucky me.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.240
Saved from having to filch
or fuck for my supper.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.880
‐Aren't you pleased?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.720
He said I can teach you to read.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.880
‐I'm a lawman's lackey

28:29.960 --> 28:31.720
and a traitor to my own kind.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.240
‐You've avoided enslavement
in America.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.720
‐What is this
if not enslavement?

28:37.760 --> 28:40.040
No freedom, no pay.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.920
I had to make a great sacrifice

28:42.000 --> 28:43.720
to get you this position.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.720
I chose your wellbeing
above my mother's.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.960
I'm not accustomed
to people being kind to me.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.000
Thank you.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.400
See, you're teaching me
new words already.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.000
‐Good God.

29:24.040 --> 29:27.000
The priestess
has slipped her shackles.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.240
‐Come.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.000
Are you demented?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.200
‐I could ask you the same.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.000
I exalted you
to silence Margaret Wells.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.000
The girl you dispatched
was a common whore

29:41.080 --> 29:43.480
with no bearing
on our business whatsoever.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.680
‐We took what opportunity
afforded us;

29:45.720 --> 29:46.880
low‐hanging fruit.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.480
‐You've put a noose
around our necks

29:48.560 --> 29:50.280
and handed the rope
to Margaret Wells.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.320
‐Bawds are easily dispatched.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.640
‐So you would add
to your heap of murders?

29:57.720 --> 30:01.240
This new judge is
adamant I do nothing,

30:01.280 --> 30:02.640
do you understand?

30:02.720 --> 30:03.800
No more games.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.680
‐How dare you give me orders?

30:06.720 --> 30:08.680
‐Be advised

30:08.720 --> 30:12.400
by your devoted priestess,

30:12.480 --> 30:14.520
and give the banshee
Margaret Wells

30:14.640 --> 30:17.080
no further cause to wail.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.720
‐You'd better pray the Archon
doesn't learn of your failure.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.320
‐Failure?

30:37.440 --> 30:40.720
‐It was you who failed
to frighten the Wells woman.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.200
What a pathetic figure
you must have cut.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.680
It's in hand.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.680
A daughter she treasures
like a pearl.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.880
She'll do nothing
to endanger her.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.320
‐Threats are
clearly ineffective.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.880
‐I don't intend
to threaten the girl.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.080
‐Take Jacob home, Lucy.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.240
Now!

31:08.880 --> 31:10.800
‐Go and get Charlotte.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.440
‐Nancy!

31:17.480 --> 31:18.560
‐Move.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.560
‐Nance!

31:19.680 --> 31:21.080
This is a good woman!

31:21.200 --> 31:22.800
‐She has been tried
and sentenced

31:22.920 --> 31:24.480
according to her offense.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.080
‐These are the actions
of a tyrant!

31:26.200 --> 31:28.200
‐Obstruct the law
at your peril!

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
‐Ma, don't!

31:29.280 --> 31:32.720
‐This w‐w‐woman

31:32.800 --> 31:35.000
is guilty of sedition.

31:35.080 --> 31:38.800
She has plotted against
the rightful rule of law.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.960
I am charged
with upholding that law,

31:42.000 --> 31:46.160
a task I neither savor
nor shrink from.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.720
‐Tyrant!

31:50.440 --> 31:51.760
Nancy!

31:53.480 --> 31:54.920
Nance!

31:55.000 --> 31:56.160
<i>‐Don't do it!</i>

31:56.240 --> 31:58.480
<i>‐Shame on you!</i>

31:58.520 --> 32:00.320
<i>‐Nance!</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:23.480
Violet!

33:30.240 --> 33:33.320
I r‐r‐require tea.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.200
Thirsty work, was it?

33:49.520 --> 33:51.800
‐I used to think people
who lived in houses like this

33:51.920 --> 33:54.680
were carefree.

33:54.720 --> 33:58.240
‐You no longer think so?

33:58.280 --> 34:02.240
‐Lady Isabella has
a 500‐pound secret.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.680
She mustn't sleep a wink.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.800
‐She intrigues you.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.880
‐No.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.480
It is you that intrigues me.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.320
I could learn
a great deal from you

34:16.400 --> 34:18.920
if you'd let me.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.000
What are you doing here,
Mrs. Quigley?

34:31.040 --> 34:33.520
‐I wanted to thank you.

34:33.600 --> 34:37.800
‐Not seeing you again will be
all the thanks that I need.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.360
‐If it were only that simple.

34:42.199 --> 34:46.440
The information I guard for you

34:46.480 --> 34:50.400
grows larger by the day.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.199
If I am to contain it,

34:52.320 --> 34:56.080
I will need further resources.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.200
‐I could've had
your tongue cut out

34:58.320 --> 35:00.080
for less than I have paid you.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.000
‐It is not money I require,

35:02.080 --> 35:04.200
but introductions.

35:04.320 --> 35:07.440
New friends of high standing.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.480
‐Emptying the coffers
is one thing,

35:10.560 --> 35:13.360
but if I start parading you
amongst our circle,

35:13.440 --> 35:15.840
I would be ostracized
and ridiculed.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.480
‐You need not reveal my trade.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.880
‐I'm sorry, Lydia,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.840
but the <i>beau monde</i>
will simply not accept you.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.880
Persuade them.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.000
‐Jacob?

36:25.040 --> 36:27.800
‐Lucy, fetch a basin
of salt water.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.200
Oh, God.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.560
The wounds must be washed,
Nance.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.840
‐I've been touched by others
too much today.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.200
‐Why won't she let us help her?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.880
‐Nancy's not like
the rest of us,

37:03.960 --> 37:08.040
every inch ogled by half
the cuffins in London.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.800
She's a secret.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.960
Were you born tired, my man?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.600
I've been knocking for an age.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.400
‐I don't work here, my man.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.040
Lucy, the door.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.760
Lucy Wells.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.280
I'm sorry about your friend.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.440
‐Did you ever meet her?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.160
‐Several times.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.960
‐She was very memorable, Kitty,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
with her jet hair...

38:08.080 --> 38:10.160
and olive skin.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.320
‐She was.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.800
‐She was auburn

38:18.880 --> 38:20.480
and alabaster.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.960
Well, that's embarrassing.

38:26.760 --> 38:30.200
I'm afraid redheads
stir nothing in me.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.640
Do I?

38:34.760 --> 38:36.560
‐Only a crushing vortex.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.800
Can I see you again?

38:44.880 --> 38:47.520
‐This is a brothel.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.760
You can have whatever you want

38:49.840 --> 38:51.040
for enough coinage.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.160
<i>‐I don't know why everyone's</i>
<i>calling for Margaret Wells</i>

39:22.280 --> 39:23.920
to be sainted.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Turning her back on people
is what she's good at.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.480
‐You don't think well of her?

39:33.520 --> 39:36.200
‐I'd see her locked in limbo,

39:36.320 --> 39:39.680
handless, with an itch
in her arse.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.120
‐Amen.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.440
‐What's she done to vex you?

39:45.480 --> 39:48.000
‐She accused me
of coveting Mr. North.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.800
‐Well, it's a brave cat
licks at that cream.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.000
‐I'm left hopeless.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.000
‐Harlot's always got hope
of a coin.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.000
‐I have no skill
for servicing drunkards

40:01.080 --> 40:04.880
against tavern walls,
even they agree.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.160
‐Trick is to go hard and fast.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.800
Conclude them before they...puke

40:09.880 --> 40:11.200
or you get moved on.

40:11.320 --> 40:15.080
‐Give me a room
and some upright culls.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.360
I'll earn you a king's ransom.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.960
‐You think a great deal
of yourself.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.360
‐You'll think a great deal
of me too.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.360
That I promise.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.920
‐Where is she?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.880
Oh, Nancy.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.760
‐You've got some front
to come here!

40:41.840 --> 40:43.160
‐I'm here for Nancy.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.880
She needs tending to.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.040
Not this.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.320
‐You must hate me

40:47.400 --> 40:49.360
to do what you did in court.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.160
I don't hate you, Ma.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.880
I pity you.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.600
‐Don't you dare pity me!

40:56.120 --> 40:58.080
Do you hear?

40:58.160 --> 41:00.480
You are unable to love,

41:00.560 --> 41:02.000
unable to be a mother.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.160
I am a mother!

41:03.280 --> 41:04.400
‐You are a pimp.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.280
That is the exact opposite.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.480
Look at the silks
that you are standing in.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.280
"Gentlemen,

41:12.360 --> 41:14.120
here is my daughter Lucy,

41:14.200 --> 41:15.480
a weeping virgin.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.480
You have a job parting
her frigid little legs,

41:17.560 --> 41:18.640
but when you do..."

41:18.760 --> 41:19.960
You shut your filthy mouth!

41:20.000 --> 41:23.160
"Or perhaps my older girl,
Charlotte,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.000
the beautiful fool.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.520
You'll have no trouble
opening her legs,

41:27.600 --> 41:29.200
but keeping her mouth shut."

41:29.320 --> 41:32.080
‐Your trouble is you've
not known enough hunger,

41:32.160 --> 41:33.840
nor enough of my hand.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.840
Oh, go fetch a rope, Ma.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.120
You've ruined me with kindness.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.600
You are a fool.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.840
You've freed the devil.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.280
Everything we are
we owe to Lydia Quigley.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.840
Six months in jail
would not have avenged that.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.400
‐Please don't put yourself
in peril, Charlotte!

41:51.480 --> 41:54.160
I cannot watch Ma
stitch your throat!

41:56.680 --> 41:59.000
Are you not stopping her?

41:59.040 --> 42:00.880
Haven't you heard?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.560
I'm not her mother.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.680
‐Put a drop of that gin
in the water

42:05.800 --> 42:07.360
when you wash Nancy's wounds.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.400
‐Not one word!

42:11.480 --> 42:14.040
I'm still your mother.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.920
You're a long way
from Cheapside.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.760
‐I'm here on the orders
of Justice Hunt.

42:40.840 --> 42:44.520
Me and my men are to see
that this...establishment

42:44.600 --> 42:47.440
does not continue trading
as a bawdy house.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.040
He is stationing us
at your door.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.760
‐We've got guests.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.880
This is our brothel's
first girl, Henrietta.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.480
‐It's Harriet.
‐That's it.

43:20.520 --> 43:23.120
‐And here we have
the cook and bottle washer.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.600
‐These are my children.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.200
‐Who will mind them
while you're creaking beds?

43:27.320 --> 43:29.640
‐You will.
‐I will not!

43:29.760 --> 43:30.960
It's why she's so cheap.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.800
‐I don't believe
we've discussed the terms.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.000
‐We'll not be discussing them.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.200
You'll get what you're given.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.440
‐Emily Lacey,
you're as drunk as a lord.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.680
I know,

43:38.800 --> 43:41.560
but this will still be
a good idea when I'm not.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.360
The culls will love her.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.520
They won't have come across
a stuck‐up black before.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.800
‐I can see why they might find
refinement a novelty.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.680
See?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.160
‐Shall I take Mercy,

43:58.280 --> 43:59.760
let you sleep?

43:59.840 --> 44:03.080
‐Decided to change
her name to Kitty.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.680
She's young enough that
she'll not miss the old one.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.160
‐I think Kitty
would've liked that.

44:12.880 --> 44:14.480
This is to send to her daughter.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.560
‐It's a fortune here.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.960
Where did you get it?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.360
‐Went collecting.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.880
People dug deep.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.560
‐If only every kind deed
rubbed out a cruel one.

44:56.640 --> 45:00.040
So this is how you fare
without Dame Death's coin?

45:00.120 --> 45:01.280
‐Mock if you will,

45:01.360 --> 45:03.480
there is honor
in righteous poverty.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.560
‐And how does that taste
between two bits of bread?

45:07.640 --> 45:11.440
‐Better than a roast pheasant
from the devil's table.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.000
What about a bit of stew
from mine?

45:14.080 --> 45:15.160
‐Thank you, but‐‐

45:15.280 --> 45:18.360
‐I'm sure it could be
purified through prayer.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.680
‐Miss Wells.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.080
‐There you go, Mrs. Scanwell.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.880
Let's get you by the fire.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.080
Know this, Mrs. Wells.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.920
I would rather return
to the cold

45:52.000 --> 45:55.800
than have any obstacles placed
between myself and God.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.200
‐I assume God

45:58.320 --> 46:00.440
won't mind you having tea.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.040
Tea?

46:05.120 --> 46:09.320
No one looks like they need
tea more than you, Amelia.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.920
‐Thank you, Mrs. Wells.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.160
‐A toast, to Kitty,

46:15.280 --> 46:17.400
who we'll remember for her life

46:17.480 --> 46:19.440
rather than her death.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.840
She was a friend.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.600
‐And a mother.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.120
‐I'm afraid I will find it
hard to think of her

46:26.200 --> 46:28.360
without imagining
that ungodly gash.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.400
What amuses you?

46:53.360 --> 46:55.560
What troubles you, child?

46:58.000 --> 47:01.800
‐Nancy Birch was flogged today.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.960
You didn't tell me.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.480
You must have heard
she and your mother

47:13.520 --> 47:17.920
once had me sent
to the whipping post.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.800
I've heard so many things
about you,

47:19.880 --> 47:22.080
I could write your life story.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.400
Well, a version of it.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.600
Will you undo my necklace?

47:44.680 --> 47:48.560
Look at them.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.160
Your mother found it easier

47:50.280 --> 47:52.120
to cast me as the villainess

47:52.200 --> 47:54.440
than to accept the truth.

47:59.280 --> 48:02.080
She would've died
a diseased child in the gutter

48:02.160 --> 48:04.280
if I had not taken her in.

48:14.360 --> 48:18.560
These scars have served
as a lifelong reminder

48:18.640 --> 48:21.480
never to hand out
kindness freely.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.600
I want so much to put my faith
in you, Charlotte.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.440
‐Then do so.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.680
‐My girl.
