<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.600 --> 00:05.273
- What the hell is this?
- It's an article I wrote.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.238
I've got a headline for your article.
It's called "Go to hell."

00:08.320 --> 00:12.199
...the candidate that I'm endorsing,
Miss Karen Roe.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.954
- You want me to ask her out?
- She's the one.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.393
If you insist.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.670
You're using me, and I'm okay with that.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.478
You're the one
who wanted to be non-exclusive.

00:21.560 --> 00:25.348
- I'm just doing what you wanted.
- I wanted you to fight for me.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.398
You're just like Dan.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.952
I'm making you co-captains.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.510
And you two are either gonna
make this work or tear it down!

00:36.880 --> 00:38.518
<i>I needed to buy some medicine.</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:41.512
<i>- For what?</i>
<i>- I have HCM.</i>

00:41.600 --> 00:43.272
I made a deal with the devil

00:43.360 --> 00:45.920
that I'd stand by his side
through this election.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.039
I can still make things difficult for him.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.869
You wanna play with me? Game on.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.998
- He can help Haley with her music.
- And you care why?

00:57.080 --> 00:59.469
Because she loves it, and I love her.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.437
Working with Chris
nearly killed our marriage.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.351
<i>I told you</i>
<i>I needed to be able to trust you again.</i>

<i>the local high school basketball team,</i>

<i>had no comment.</i>

02:06.280 --> 02:08.077
I got a comment for you.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.788
Gym! Suicide! Move!

02:12.240 --> 02:17.155
The way I see it,
you boys owe this school a major debt,

02:18.360 --> 02:22.478
and you'll find that payback is a bitch

02:24.080 --> 02:26.753
and the currency is pain!

02:43.160 --> 02:44.559
Sleep well, honey?

02:45.200 --> 02:48.272
Funny thing. I woke up in the middle
of the night to use the bathroom,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.316
and all the toilets were clogged.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.356
How are the toilets
on your side of the house?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.237
Fine. Maybe you should call a plumber.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.675
Oh, don't worry. I'll make do.
You going for a swim?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.512
Nothing gets by you, Dan.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.434
The water's warm. You're in for a treat.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.560
- Oh, hey! I'm sorry. I'm just running late.
- That's cool.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.710
Hey, by the way,
I don't know what was going on

03:12.800 --> 03:14.074
with you and Lucas at Midnight Madness,

03:14.160 --> 03:17.277
but I really wish you guys could get back
to the way things used to be.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.271
No, this is the way
things used to be, Haley.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.477
I meant before I left.
What were you fighting about, anyway?

03:22.560 --> 03:23.629
You.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.116
So you're a cheerleader now?
What's that all about?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.713
Brooke needed my help.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.356
Kind of glad
I get to see more of you, though.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.759
Is it okay with you?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.070
Not that I need your permission
or anything, I just...

03:35.160 --> 03:38.277
You don't. But next time you wanna talk,
don't pretend to run into me.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.238
Just talk to me, Hales.
I don't wanna play games.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.989
You mean, like, other than challenging me
to work with Chris again?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.196
Yeah, I guess that's fair.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.314
- So how's it going, anyway?
- I don't know. Coming along, I guess.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.355
Don't sleep on your music, Hales.
It's a big part of who you are.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.789
Yeah.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.514
So are you.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.553
So, are you gonna give me
the damage report on you and Lucas?

04:03.640 --> 04:06.950
Let's see. One boy, one car,
one naked skeez in the back seat,

04:07.040 --> 04:08.917
and one Brooke Davis totally flipping out.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.390
- Oh! Rachel stole your move, huh?
- Not the point.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.675
It just really set me off,
seeing them together.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.035
Even though you are the one
that put them together?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.235
Way to twist the knife.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.833
The point is that she can't come in here

04:19.920 --> 04:21.591
and try to steal my squad
and my boyfriend.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.798
Boyfriend? Isn't that, like, a dirty word
in the whole "keeping it casual" scenario?

04:25.880 --> 04:29.077
Yes. Okay, I know.
I totally screwed this up.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.718
But what am I supposed to say
to him now?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.552
Well, see, there's this new thing out.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.870
It's called an apology.
All the cool kids are doing it.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.837
You might wanna try it.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.956
You know what?
If you really get into trouble,

04:39.040 --> 04:40.917
try using the word "exclusive."

04:42.760 --> 04:43.909
Hey, there.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.959
Okay, look, I'm really sorry, Luke.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.429
I know that I came down on you
really hard the other night,

04:53.520 --> 04:56.671
and I know that the whole date
with Rachel was my idea,

04:57.120 --> 04:58.678
but I do have feelings for you.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.030
Listen, I thought a lot
about what you said the other night,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.076
you know, about what kind of guy
you want me to be,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.310
and I wanna be that guy for you.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.197
But you have to let me be that guy.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.078
If I say okay,
do you promise to lower the weapon?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.197
Oh. Sorry.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.631
- So what you got there, anyway?
- Flyers for my fantasy league.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.238
- Sounds kinky.
- Fantasy basketball league.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.194
Sounds lame. How does it work?

05:25.320 --> 05:29.472
Well, there's a draft
where you pick from a list of NBA players

05:29.560 --> 05:32.154
and build your own ideal fantasy team.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.109
So you get to pick and choose
from a big group of hot, athletic guys?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.590
Definitely take that back. Not lame.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.240
Although you know
there are better things to fantasize about.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.153
Yeah, well, I don't really have a girlfriend.
What else is there?

05:49.760 --> 05:52.274
You liar! You knew I was gonna
ask Fede out and you sniped him!

05:52.360 --> 05:54.510
Just 'cause he's in your cart
doesn't mean I can't grab him

05:54.600 --> 05:56.875
- before you get to the checkout line.
- Yeah? Check this out.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.951
Oh, no. No, you don't.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.991
- I could fantasize about them.
- Bevin! Ashley!

06:03.440 --> 06:05.158
- Stop!
- You can't really blame them.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.755
I mean, they watched their captain go all
<i>Kung Fu Hustle</i> at Midnight Madness,

06:08.840 --> 06:10.990
and now they all wanna look like Brooke.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.796
Of course,
that would mean a trip to Goodwill.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.513
Hey, Luke.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.037
All right, Paris and Nicole,
that's quite enough.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.351
If I wanted to watch cheerleaders wrestle,
I'd turn on pay-per-view.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.273
- It's okay, Coach. I can handle them.
- Is that a fact?

06:28.360 --> 06:30.999
After your little melee
at the Midnight Madness,

06:31.080 --> 06:33.753
Principal Turner and I
came to a meeting of the minds.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.068
Another fight like this

06:35.160 --> 06:37.116
and there won't be any cheerleaders
this season.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.668
Get your squad under control, Miss Davis.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.991
Otherwise you'll find yourself
cheering for the chess team.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.990
Squad meeting, now!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.996
This is my senior year,

06:51.080 --> 06:55.471
and as long as I am captain,
I am not about to lose this squad

06:55.560 --> 06:57.710
because we are all fighting
over the same guys.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.189
- Bevin knows I like Fede.
- Too bad Fede's not into whores.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.474
Okay, enough!

07:04.080 --> 07:05.638
Do you have a problem?

07:06.720 --> 07:09.439
Just waiting
to hear what your plan is, Captain.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.153
"My plan!"

07:12.080 --> 07:14.230
I'll tell you what my plan is.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.991
We're waiting, aren't we, girls?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.471
The plan is

07:26.520 --> 07:28.238
Fantasy Boy Draft.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.079
Okay, here's the rules
of the Fantasy Boy Draft.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.515
Once you pick a guy,
he's yours for the season,

07:47.600 --> 07:51.354
which means he's off the market
and no one else can touch him.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.795
- Got it, Bevin? Ashley?
- What are these for?

07:53.880 --> 07:56.314
I'm glad you asked, trial-separation girl.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.472
Open them up.
The number on your compact

07:59.560 --> 08:01.516
will determine where you are
in the draft order.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.955
So, wait, what's to keep us
from just dating whoever we want,

08:04.040 --> 08:05.314
even with this little draft thingy?

08:05.400 --> 08:08.551
Good question, Bevin.
Of course, you'd be kicked off the squad

08:08.640 --> 08:09.709
or worse.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.108
- Like how, "worse"?
- Like...

08:13.800 --> 08:15.756
What's to keep me
from telling the whole school

08:15.840 --> 08:19.469
that one of you was left handcuffed
to lan Thomas' bed for seven hours

08:19.560 --> 08:21.118
waiting for a locksmith?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.236
Or that at the Sparkle Classic last year,

08:23.320 --> 08:27.598
one of you had a little too much to drink
and made out with another one of you?

08:28.640 --> 08:31.712
Or that that scar
on a certain someone's back

08:31.800 --> 08:33.631
isn't really from falling off her bike,

08:33.720 --> 08:35.312
but was one of those little baby spine tails

08:35.400 --> 08:37.549
that the doctors had to lop off
after she was born?

08:37.640 --> 08:41.076
In other words, honor. Code of silence.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.355
You all keep the rules of the code,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.829
I keep silent about all the dirt
I have on all of you.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.036
Break the rules and it's social suicide.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.511
Final rule, if at any time during the season
you are not happy with your draft picks,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.716
you can trade someone else.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.872
Okay? Let's count out our numbers,
starting from one.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.712
- One.
- Way to go, P. Sawyer,

08:59.800 --> 09:03.475
with pick <i>número uno.</i>
Right behind you with number two.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.595
Who's got three?

09:04.680 --> 09:06.352
- Three.
- Four.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.670
- Five.
- So wait.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.354
Once we pick our guy, then what happens?

09:11.440 --> 09:12.668
It's up to you.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.552
- Hello, there.
- Hey.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.315
- All quiet on the western front?
- Not even close.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.152
Last night, I clogged the toilet
on Dan's side of the house.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.310
Now he's even more full of crap
than usual.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.472
Well, I wanna show you something.
These are hot off the presses.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.549
Here you go.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.677
The first official
"Roe for Mayor" campaign poster.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.877
"Roe, Roe, Roe your vote!" That's cute.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.159
There you go.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.631
You're gonna need a bigger sign.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.988
Throughout the 19th century,
China's emperors watched in dismay

10:13.080 --> 10:16.470
as foreigners encroached
further and further into their lands.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.028
In the hopes of repelling
this foreign invasion,

10:19.120 --> 10:21.714
the Empress took the radical step
of allying herself

10:21.800 --> 10:24.678
with former enemy insurgents
known as the Boxers.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.315
Now, the Boxers were a secret society

10:27.400 --> 10:31.188
who had previously waged war
against China's imperial government.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.798
The Empress believed that by providing
aid and support to the Boxers,

10:35.880 --> 10:40.874
she could use this former enemy
to expel the foreign intruders.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.555
Miss Davis,
perhaps there's something in that note

10:43.640 --> 10:45.915
that could enlighten us
about the Boxer Rebellion.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.151
Well, they totally won out over briefs.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.595
The purse. Let's have it.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.549
Excuse me, Miss... Miss...
Sorry, I forgot your name.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.273
- Jelline.
- Right. My bad.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.271
In <i>New Jersey vs. T.L.O.,</i>

11:06.360 --> 11:08.749
the Supreme Court ruled
that unless a law has been broken

11:08.840 --> 11:11.400
or there's probable cause
to suspect a law has been broken,

11:11.480 --> 11:15.473
searches and/ or seizures
of students' property is unlawful.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.034
And the last time I checked,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.680
not paying attention in class
wasn't a crime.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.749
Good save.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.798
- Pretty sweet legal moves, counselor.
- You should see my not-so-legal moves.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.557
Hey, do you actually think
I need your help?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.870
Well, I guess that's a "thank you"
in Brooke world.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.190
Oh, look, you got something right.
It is my world.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.918
And you may have my whole squad fooled,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.958
but if you are trying to suck up to me,
don't bother.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.196
Hey, she did kind of bail you out
back there.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.555
You are not allowed to defend her.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.675
In fact, I would appreciate

12:02.760 --> 12:04.990
if you didn't associate with her,
clothed or otherwise.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.594
Well, does this mean you're gonna pick me
in your fantasy draft?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.432
- How did you know about that?
- Oh, come on.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.273
From three rows back,
I still know what a fantasy draft looks like.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.509
Well, I admit nothing.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.158
It's just a plan
to keep the rest of my squad

12:15.240 --> 12:17.071
- from tearing each other's heads off.
- Really?

12:17.160 --> 12:21.870
You sure it's not about Brooke Davis
having her cake and dating it, too?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.439
Could be. Could not be.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.229
But I'll let you know if we need to
schedule a private workout for research.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.556
Saw the NOFX sticker on your locker.
Figured you'd be into this.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.029
Super-rare bootleg,
recorded straight off the mixing board.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.759
Right. Look, Rachel,
Brooke's my best friend,

12:39.840 --> 12:41.910
so you can try to buy her off
with your legal jargon,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.070
but you can't buy me off with a bootleg.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.391
Peyton, I'm offering
to let you borrow a CD,

12:47.480 --> 12:48.959
and anything else is your baggage.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.873
Honestly, I'm just surprised
a cheerleader's into punk.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.269
I didn't think anybody
was that screwed-up.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.793
I mean, besides me.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.798
- Come on, Peyton. I'm trying here.
- Right.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.553
You do realize I'm the one that tackled you
at Midnight Madness, right?

13:03.640 --> 13:06.996
Yeah, but I heard the rumors.
I just figured you were into me.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.239
Look, I get it.
Some people just don't get along.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.914
But being friends with me
does not mean you're betraying Brooke.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.831
You don't know Brooke very well, do you?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.235
Come on. You know you wanna hear it.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.988
No, thanks.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.434
Oh, man, Lucas looks really tired.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.875
Well, I certainly haven't been
keeping him up at night.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.997
Of course, that could all change
after the Boy Draft.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.435
All right, I gotta go.
Keep an eye on him, huh?

13:54.520 --> 13:55.839
I will.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.515
Maybe two.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.115
Making some notes
on potential draft picks?

14:08.200 --> 14:11.590
- Not really.
- Wow, she's pretty. Who is she?

14:11.680 --> 14:14.240
Wish I knew. So what's up, Mouth?

14:14.320 --> 14:17.949
The draft. Everybody's talking about it.
I was just wondering,

14:18.040 --> 14:20.315
any chance a guy like me
has a shot at getting picked?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.594
Come on, Mouth.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.796
What are you talking about?
You're a total catch.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.235
I guarantee someone's gonna pick you.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.232
Besides, you'll probably be
the only guy left alive.

14:30.840 --> 14:31.909
Lucas Scott!

14:32.000 --> 14:34.878
Why don't you hop on your brother's back
and let him carry you?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.713
All right, gentlemen, line up.
Let's do it again.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.633
There's a reason they call these 16-60s.

14:40.720 --> 14:45.589
Each one of you has to touch that sideline
16 times in 60 seconds.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.669
If one of you fails to do it,
then you all do it again.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.829
Better get your ass in shape.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.514
You'll be the only captain in the league
riding the bench.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.875
Come on, baby. We're in this together.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.352
- Bevin!
- Hi!

15:02.440 --> 15:06.149
So, why wasn't Rachel scouting
for the Fantasy Draft today?

15:06.240 --> 15:09.152
She said she didn't have to.
She already knows who she's gonna pick.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.276
And who might that be?

15:11.760 --> 15:13.751
She kind of made me promise
I wouldn't tell anybody.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.955
Okay.

15:15.280 --> 15:19.273
Bev, I know you guys
have become fast friends, and that's cool.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.113
You probably wanna be loyal,

15:22.920 --> 15:24.512
not betray her.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.953
Chris Keller.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.190
Wait. Chris Keller?

15:29.280 --> 15:33.432
Yeah. Rachel met him at the record store.
She's got a thing for musicians.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.272
Plus, she said he's really, really sweet.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.674
It sucks, Haley.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.718
I worked really hard on that song.
What do you mean, it sucks?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.518
I mean it sucks so bad,

15:41.600 --> 15:43.955
I'm wondering if it's possible
to un-hear a song.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.270
Well, maybe it's the song that's good
and it's you that sucks.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.557
Yeah, maybe. Let me think.
No, it's the song.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.393
But the one good thing about it,
besides the fact that it's over,

15:52.480 --> 15:54.675
is now that you've gotten all the crap
out of your system,

15:54.760 --> 15:56.637
you can write something real.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.870
You gotta write the truth, Hales.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.912
How are things with Nathan?

16:02.080 --> 16:04.753
The... I'm not discussing that with you.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.633
- That bad, huh?
- No. Things are fine.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.548
I don't think they are.
I think things are a mess, Haley.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.112
And until you deal with that,
your music's gonna suffer.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.993
Look who it is.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.674
I didn't even know if you still went
to this school no more, dog.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.671
You've been spending too much time
in the art center.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.035
Might do you some good
to hang out with us non-gifted kids.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.918
Whatever.
Don't be acting like you ain't been busy.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.513
I thought
I was gonna have to hide butt-naked

16:37.600 --> 16:39.158
in your back seat
just to get your attention.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.229
You heard about that?

16:40.320 --> 16:42.117
Man, the whole school
heard about that, dog.

16:42.560 --> 16:46.712
But, I mean, you could share the wealth.
First Brooke Davis, now the new redhead.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.155
I mean, you do know
why the back seat was invented, right?

16:49.240 --> 16:52.789
- Yeah, I think I was conceived in one.
- Good point.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.119
But on the real, man, how you holding up?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.270
- You good?
- What do you mean?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.396
First half of the summer,
you play like straight trash,

16:59.480 --> 17:01.994
then, bam, you back to the old Luke.
I mean, what's going on?

17:02.080 --> 17:04.513
Oh, nothing. Just finally getting in shape.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.229
Right. And that wouldn't have nothing
to do with your little heart condition thing

17:08.319 --> 17:09.877
your mom's got all worked up about,
would it?

17:09.960 --> 17:12.598
HCM. No, I tested negative.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.638
Luke, I know you love the game, dog,
just like I love the game.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.960
But the people in your life,
they love you more.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.271
- You do understand that, right?
- Yeah. Skills, I get it, all right? I'll be fine.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.156
- All right, man.
- All right.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.636
- What?
- Hey, yo, check this out.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.398
Shorty been checking me out
all week, son.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.711
Yeah, there's this boy draft thing,
you know.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.789
Yeah, I heard.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.074
But on the real,

17:41.160 --> 17:43.799
last time somebody was
following me around like that,

17:43.880 --> 17:45.711
I was in the department store.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.153
Straight up.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.996
Brooke, that's amazing!
Now, what exactly did your manager say?

17:53.080 --> 17:55.196
Well, she said
she showed my clothing designs

17:55.280 --> 17:57.669
to all the corporate monkeys
at Suburban Filth,

17:57.760 --> 17:59.432
and they totally responded.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.830
So now all I need is Rachel to die of TSS
and life will be perfect.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.070
Yeah. Hey, have you noticed
how all the guys

18:05.160 --> 18:06.878
have been acting
really Stepford-ish lately?

18:06.960 --> 18:07.949
It's the Fantasy Boy Draft.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.234
- We have the first two picks.
- Right.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.788
We should have done this years ago.
Now we have all the power.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.518
Oh, so that's why
you rigged the draft order,

18:13.600 --> 18:15.511
so you could lock up Lucas exclusively.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.672
Maybe. Okay, probably. What about you?

18:18.760 --> 18:21.354
Any chance Jake's gonna turn up
by Friday?

18:22.080 --> 18:24.355
Sorry, buddy. But fear not.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.715
Every boy here
wants to be the first pick in the draft.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.074
Oh, you think?

18:28.520 --> 18:29.714
Watch this.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.908
Thank you.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.869
Hey.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.430
Never expected the cheerleading squad
to have more drama than the drama club.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.919
What did you expect from cheerleading?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.797
I don't know.
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.075
I'm kind of glad
I get to see more of Nathan and you guys.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.878
I just...
I don't know how I'm gonna balance this

18:54.960 --> 18:56.393
with doing the music thing with Chris.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.550
- You're working with Chris again?
- Yeah. Actually...

18:58.640 --> 19:00.915
You know, for someone
that wants to stay close to Nathan,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.718
spending time with the guy
that drove you apart

19:02.800 --> 19:04.313
is a hell of a way to show it.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.994
I already know who I'm drafting,

19:20.080 --> 19:22.833
but I thought you guys could use
these scouting reports I put together.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.309
Every guy's stats,
cross-referenced with dating histories

19:25.400 --> 19:27.356
and stuff written on bathroom stalls.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.634
Nice!

19:28.760 --> 19:31.320
- Oh, my God!
- Thanks.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.992
- Let's see.
- Wow.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.070
Oh, I'm drafting the hell out of that.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.435
- Absolutely.
- Rachel, you rock.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.189
That's awesome.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.437
Hi. Okay. Ready?
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.911
Next. Hi. Okay.
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.878
Hi. Oh, that's great. Hold it right there.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.916
Mouth, can you do me a favor?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.514
- Sure, snap away.
- No.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.431
Can you move out of the way?

21:10.680 --> 21:12.557
All right, ready? Okay, here we go again.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.110
Looking a little tired there, Lucas.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.829
Maybe you don't have the heart for this.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.075
What do you want?

21:33.160 --> 21:35.628
I want you
to talk some sense into your mother.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.518
- Tell her to drop out of the mayor's race.
- Why?

21:39.560 --> 21:40.879
Are you afraid of competition?

21:40.960 --> 21:43.679
I would be
if there actually was a competition.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.670
Then again, blowouts are kind of fun.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.709
Just talk to her.
That is, if you can catch your breath.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.273
- You wanna touch it?
- No, I was just...

22:08.360 --> 22:11.636
Come on. Come on, check out my assets.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.476
Touch the Skills hills.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.354
You know Skills got two "L's" in it, right?

22:43.440 --> 22:46.750
- You're late. Kind of pushing it, aren't you?
- That makes two of us.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.159
I was at the library doing research,

22:48.240 --> 22:51.471
and I think I figured out why you've been
having so much trouble at practice.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.118
- Hi, Haley.
- Hi.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.314
I found this website that said
that sluggish physical performance

22:57.400 --> 22:59.356
is one of the side effects
of the HCM medication.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.953
Now, it's bad enough
you haven't told your mom,

23:01.040 --> 23:02.632
but I really think
you should talk to Whitey.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.119
- I can handle it.
- Luke!

23:04.200 --> 23:06.953
Players have collapsed and died
because of this, okay?

23:07.040 --> 23:11.033
- You need to tell Whitey about your heart.
- I don't know if I can do that.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.757
Well, I know one thing.
If you don't talk to him, I will.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.794
Janis Joplin.
Now, she's a great songwriter.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.590
I wonder if it's possible
to un-meet a person.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.592
Hey, I was just being honest,
like all the great songwriters are.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.159
Like you need to be.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.918
Look, take Eric Clapton.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.389
All of his best songs came from pain
and longing.

23:43.480 --> 23:46.153
<i>Layla,</i> about his best friend's woman.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.159
<i>Tears in Heaven,</i> for his son.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.355
Thank you for the pep talk,

23:49.440 --> 23:50.759
but I really do need to get back to this,

23:50.840 --> 23:52.159
- so if you don't mind...
- I know.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.753
You didn't put my name up there.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.395
Chris, that wall is for great musicians.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.119
- I know.
- I do not belong up here.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.956
If you stop running from your emotion
and start writing about it,

24:05.040 --> 24:06.439
one day you might.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.708
- No morning swim today?
- Nope.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.029
I guess you'll be on the campaign trail
all day today?

24:26.520 --> 24:27.714
That's right.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.393
Gotta run.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.509
I'll bet.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.629
"Mayoral election to be a Dan-slide."

24:36.440 --> 24:38.795
Did you get a look
at the first election polls?

24:38.880 --> 24:42.156
- It's almost like I'm running unopposed.
- Go away, Dan.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.117
No, no. You keep it. My treat.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.476
I've never taken anything from you before.
Why start now?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.711
Great. I can use the change for the meter.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.076
You worried, Dan? I mean, why else
would you even bother coming in here?

24:53.160 --> 24:55.469
Afraid what will happen
once the voters get to know me?

24:55.560 --> 24:57.949
But they won't, Karen. Think about it.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.508
Do you even have the resources
to wage an effective campaign?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.477
Do you have the respect
of the community?

25:02.560 --> 25:03.709
Do you...

25:07.160 --> 25:08.798
Do you have a bathroom?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.068
So, I guess you survived Whitey's practice.

25:17.160 --> 25:18.752
Seems like he's been pretty tough
on you guys.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.432
- How you holding up?
- I can roll with it.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.556
I've been meaning to ask you
the same question, though.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.629
Caught your latest podcast,

25:23.720 --> 25:26.439
and I guess I didn't realize
the situation with your mom was so...

25:26.520 --> 25:29.080
Yeah. But, you know, I can roll with it.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.152
Just as long as you know
you don't have to roll solo.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.516
- So, you ready for this draft thing?
- Yeah. Any chance I won't get picked?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.795
Well, let's see. I have the first pick,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.472
and then you're safe
with Brooke and Bevin,

25:39.560 --> 25:41.630
but then there's the fourth pick, your wife.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.835
Yeah.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.388
Look, if you're not ready
to go on a date with Haley,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.436
I can pick you, okay? But it's your call.

25:47.520 --> 25:50.910
So you tell me.
Do you want Haley to pick you?

25:56.400 --> 25:59.710
Well, well,
the tortoise finally crosses the finish line.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.315
Don't you mean the hare?
The tortoise finished first.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.757
You couldn't beat either one of them.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.159
Look, there's a reason
I've been lagging behind, Coach.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.073
I'm out of shape.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.594
I'll do whatever it takes to get it back.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.672
It's not fair to take it out on the team.
They don't deserve it.

26:25.760 --> 26:29.594
If you have to take it out on someone,
take it out on me.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.713
Don't worry, son.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.238
I'll take care of you.

26:39.680 --> 26:43.116
Seems I've been unfairly riding you guys
a little too hard lately,

26:43.200 --> 26:46.192
at least according to your co-captain,
Lucas Scott.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.236
So he's taking today's practice off

26:48.320 --> 26:51.357
so he can catch up
on his sleepy-sleepy time.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.634
Go have a seat.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.280
The rest of you
are gonna work twice as hard!

27:05.360 --> 27:07.590
All right, to the sidelines!
Now! Get moving!

27:07.680 --> 27:08.874
Go! Go! Go!

27:13.040 --> 27:15.474
What the hell's the matter with you, man?

27:16.640 --> 27:18.710
All right, let's move! Move! Move!

27:18.800 --> 27:21.314
My grandmother
could run faster than you.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.833
- Hi, Haley.
- Hey.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.989
Hey.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.072
I was just wondering,
how are things with you and Nathan?

27:46.560 --> 27:47.834
Complicated.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.833
- But I'm not gonna give up on him.
- You go, Hales. Good for you.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.910
- He's a no-go, girls.
- Oh.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.115
Bevin, Nathan's my husband.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.236
You can't seriously be thinking
of drafting him.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.470
Yeah, Bevin, you can't draft Nathan.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.394
Thanks, Peyton.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.434
'Cause I have first pick and I'm taking him.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.076
Look, ho-bot, this is a poser-free zone.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.913
What's wrong, Brookie?
Jealous 'cause the Keller isn't into you?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.197
I wouldn't let the Keller into me
if he were the...

28:28.160 --> 28:31.869
- Oh, my God, I love your necklace.
- And your shoes are so fetch.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.077
Well, I'm glad to see
you girls have patched things up.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.878
Oh, yeah, we're totally <i>Beaches.</i>

28:36.960 --> 28:40.111
Oh, you know,
if you girls refer to each other that way,

28:40.200 --> 28:42.270
the boys are gonna think
it's all right to do the same.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.920
No, Coach. <i>Beaches,</i> like the movie.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.989
Oh.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.192
Well, carry on.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.228
- "Fetch"?
- Yeah.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.639
You know, something a dog does.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.915
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
How do you feel about the Mathletes?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.592
'Cause that's who
you're gonna be cheering for

28:56.680 --> 28:58.557
if you don't quit cage-matching
it out with Rachel.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.835
Why don't you just put the "leader"
back in "cheerleader"

29:00.920 --> 29:01.909
and make peace with her?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.752
You know, Peyton, I will.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.751
Just as soon
as you make peace with Haley.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.909
That's what I thought.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.389
And PS, you cannot draft Nathan.
He's Haley's.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.313
No, he was. Then she skipped town.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.960
They're married.
This is bad stuff, P. Sawyer.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.031
Isn't there anybody else
that you could pick?

29:17.120 --> 29:19.475
Well, yeah. There's Lucas.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.120
Oh, no. On second thought,
Nathan's a great idea.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.830
So I guess it's safe to say
that you didn't talk to Whitey.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.632
It's fine. I'll tell him.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.429
Haley.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.117
Look, you don't get it.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.113
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition,
I'm off the team.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.760
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey
about your heart condition,

29:42.840 --> 29:44.319
you're off the planet.

29:44.400 --> 29:48.757
Haley, for the longest time,
I have been an outsider.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.675
When I joined this team
and the guys accepted me,

29:51.760 --> 29:54.797
I became a part of something,
and it's something I care about.

29:54.880 --> 29:59.237
- I know, Luke.
- I'm not gonna die if I take the pills.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.356
I just have to work hard
to compensate for the medication.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.953
Luke, will you listen to yourself?

30:05.040 --> 30:06.189
The medication that you're taking

30:06.280 --> 30:07.633
is supposed to inhibit your performance.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.119
That is how it saves your life.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.397
"I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul"

30:12.680 --> 30:13.715
What?

30:14.440 --> 30:16.635
William Henley, <i>Invictus.</i>

30:17.240 --> 30:19.470
- It's Latin...
- Invincible. Yeah, I know. I know the poem.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.994
I also know that William Henley
didn't have a heart condition.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.469
Luke, you're not invincible!

30:28.520 --> 30:30.511
I just hope you live long enough
to realize it.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.312
For your consideration,
I would make an excellent sleeper pick.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.549
Gross!

30:43.640 --> 30:46.108
No, it doesn't mean that. It just means...

30:47.840 --> 30:48.875
Cookie?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.751
- They're fresh-baked.
- Sure.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.559
- Hey.
- Hi, Haley.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.594
Thank you.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.952
I just want you to know that
you're wasting your time drafting Nathan.

31:04.040 --> 31:08.272
You can pick him. I can't stop you.
But I'm not going anywhere, Peyton.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.272
Nathan and I are meant to be together.
I know that, you know that,

31:11.360 --> 31:14.113
and one of these days
he's gonna know that, too.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.552
Who wants cupcakes?

31:32.080 --> 31:36.312
Has everybody seen my new wall?
It's of the French Riviera.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.955
Italian Riviera, actually.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.511
Excuse me, it's my wall.

31:42.600 --> 31:47.151
Well, your wall is of the Portofino harbor.
We vacay there every year.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.870
See? Here? That's the Splendido Mare.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.788
I met the hottest guy while staying there.

31:55.880 --> 31:56.995
Gorgeous.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.711
So, you two bury the hatchet yet?

32:02.800 --> 32:05.519
Funny thing,
I'm about to bury it in her throat.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.033
Brooke gave it to me.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.188
So, considering I'm an honors student,

32:14.280 --> 32:17.272
how many years do you think I would get
if I stabbed someone, say Peyton,

32:17.360 --> 32:19.794
with, like, a giant fork or...

32:19.880 --> 32:21.950
Okay, let's not keep sharp objects
around the house.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.110
I know that this whole thing with Nathan
sucks for you,

32:24.200 --> 32:26.395
but right now, I need your help
bringing Rachel to her knees.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.756
Yes, I know, it's ironic. So, here's my plan.
I'm gonna snipe her draft pick.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.513
She needs to know what it feels like
when the shoe's up the other ass.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.273
Okay, what do you need from me?
And do not say my shoes.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.555
No. Rachel picks fifth. You pick fourth.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.278
I need you to pick Lucas
so no one else gets him

32:39.360 --> 32:40.475
while I'm screwing her over.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.233
- What about Bevin? She's third.
- Yeah, but she's picking Skills.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.639
We got a deal?

32:44.720 --> 32:47.598
Yeah, well, if I can't have Nathan,
I might as well take Lucas.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.069
Deal.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.278
Well, well. What do you say, partner?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.035
Here's half the money
for Haley's studio time.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.111
I'll get you the rest next week.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.829
You ever heard of Robert Johnson, Nate?

33:11.920 --> 33:14.388
Sure. He's a forward for the Oregon Ducks.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.875
No.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.119
Robert Johnson was a bluesman
back in the '30s.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.711
The story goes, he made a deal
with the devil for the gift of music.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.956
Kind of like you're doing for Haley.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.317
- So what, you're supposed to be the devil?
- No, man, I'm Robert Johnson.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.753
You're the devil.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.110
- So how's Haley doing?
- Not well. How are you and Haley doing?

33:37.360 --> 33:39.237
Let's get something straight.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.950
I'm here to talk about Haley
and her music, not Haley and me.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.996
You still don't get it, do you?
They're the same thing.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.155
Could we just pull the blinds
or something?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.434
Nope.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.398
Keeps me focused
on how badly I need to beat him.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.436
Yeah. I saw him today.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.715
He's not gonna make it easy on you,
you know.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.678
- Is that what he told you?
- More or less.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.393
You know, Lucas, I...

34:07.480 --> 34:10.710
I may not have the money
or the connections that Dan has,

34:11.440 --> 34:14.989
but what I do have is my reputation
as a good, upstanding person

34:15.080 --> 34:17.594
who raised a decent enough son
on her own.

34:17.679 --> 34:21.389
And apparently skipped
the part of table manners.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.030
And that's what the voters will see.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.036
Yeah, but is it worth it?

34:30.159 --> 34:31.592
You know,
if you wanna change something,

34:31.679 --> 34:33.636
you have to be willing to work hard at it.

34:33.719 --> 34:37.156
But you do work hard, Mom.
I mean, come on. You run two businesses.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.071
Well, sometimes
when you're done working hard,

34:39.159 --> 34:41.913
you have to work a little harder.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.993
Where are you off to?

34:56.719 --> 34:58.358
To work a little harder.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.836
And now,
the moment everyone's been waiting for,

35:03.920 --> 35:06.559
the first annual
Tree Hill Fantasy Boy Draft.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.677
P. Sawyer, you've got the first pick,
and you are on the clock.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.990
Who's this year's first draft pick gonna be?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.949
I'll pick

35:17.000 --> 35:18.228
Mouth McFadden.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.596
- Mouth goes to Peyton!
- Number one draft pick, baby!

35:22.440 --> 35:23.429
Hey, Mouth.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.759
Okay, Brooke, you're next.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.392
Oh, Brooke, we need to talk.
Since Peyton...

35:28.480 --> 35:30.550
No, not now, Haley. I pick Chris Keller.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.191
Chris Keller goes to Brooke.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.074
Bevin, you're next.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.639
- Actually...
- There's been a trade.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.676
- What?
- Well, you said we could trade.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.638
So Bevin traded me her number three pick.
And I pick Lucas.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.438
- Lucas Scott to Rachel!
- But she can't...

35:43.520 --> 35:44.555
I pick Nathan.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.675
- Nathan Scott to Haley.
- Wait!

35:45.760 --> 35:47.193
- I get Skills.
- Skills to Bevin.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.474
- Wait!
- I'll take Fede.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.709
- Narayan.
- Zack.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.949
- Dustin.
- Daniel.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.075
Debar.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.791
This is awesome.
Everybody got who they wanted.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.313
Great idea, Brooke.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.594
Super.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.069
Bevin.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.397
What the hell
was going through your size-two brain?

36:10.480 --> 36:12.391
You said we could trade.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.838
Why is she wearing my necklace?

36:14.920 --> 36:17.195
- Because that was part of the trade.
- Okay.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.910
Why would you trade your third pick
and my necklace

36:22.000 --> 36:23.797
for Rachel's fifth pick?

36:23.880 --> 36:28.192
Duh. Brooke, five is more than three.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.155
Oh.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.356
It made total sense
when Rachel explained it.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.634
Right.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.551
- Hey, that's my necklace.
- No, it's mine.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.517
And I guess
it comes with the matching boyfriend.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.160
- Oh, you're not getting Lucas.
- Oh, really?

36:43.160 --> 36:46.596
"Anyone who's caught breaking the rules
will be kicked off the squad."

36:46.680 --> 36:49.035
So, I guess
I can have your captain spot, too.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.588
I think Brooke deserves
a great big round of applause

36:51.680 --> 36:53.796
for orchestrating this whole event.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.353
Anything else of yours I want,
I'll let you know.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.990
- It was great.
- Thank you so much.

37:03.560 --> 37:04.993
- Night, dear.
- Okay.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.394
Peyton,

37:07.560 --> 37:09.676
I just want to say thank you
for not picking Nathan.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.432
It wasn't me. It was you.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.512
It's about time
you started to fight for your husband.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.231
<i>Karen Roe claims to be a sweet,</i>

37:23.320 --> 37:26.357
<i>levelheaded local businesswoman</i>
<i>and mother.</i>
