00:17.434 --> 00:18.768
<i> Dostoevsky wrote,</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:24.024
<i>"If a man has a conscience,</i>
<i>he will suffer for his mistake.</i>

00:24.941 --> 00:28.236
<i>That will be his punishment</i>
<i>as well as his prison."</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:31.781
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.661
What did you do?

00:37.746 --> 00:39.330
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.291
I'm so sorry.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.002
Why? I mean, she was crazy.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.754
She was gonna hurt you.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.088
And us.

00:47.672 --> 00:48.673
And I fixed it.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.384
We can be together now.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.346
I don't think we can.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.476
I think I broke you.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.478
-I'm fine.
-Listen to me.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.314
This is not your fault.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.316
This is not you.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.069
Everything I told you is true.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.821
Beck, Henderson,

01:12.781 --> 01:14.032
Delilah...

01:15.533 --> 01:16.576
I killed them.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.287
Their blood is on my hands.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.373
-Joe.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.127
You didn't kill Delilah.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.714
I did.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.719
-<i> You know that old cliché...</i>
-You're a sneaky, manipulative bitch.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.056
<i> "You can choose your friends,</i>
<i>but you can’t choose your family."</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:41.101
<i>My brother</i>
<i>and I learned that lesson early.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:42.811
We can still enjoy what we have, right?

01:42.894 --> 01:47.607
<i>Absentee parents, too self-absorbed</i>
<i>to notice a fox in the henhouse.</i>

01:48.191 --> 01:49.526
-Hold on, what are you--
-Shh.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.655
<i> Nobody to show us</i>
<i>what healthy caretaking should look like.</i>

01:54.072 --> 01:55.448
<i>Forty was a child.</i>

01:56.616 --> 01:57.909
<i>She was a rapist.</i>

01:58.785 --> 01:59.786
<i>I stopped her.</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:08.253
I protected Forty because I had to.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.880
<i> Because nobody else was.</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:20.598
<i>Better they thought it was him.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:23.393
<i>Forty was blacked out, a victim.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:27.188
<i>They’d cover it up,</i>
<i>coddle him like always.</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:31.025
<i>I could stay close, protect him.</i>

02:31.109 --> 02:32.527
We need utter privacy...

02:32.610 --> 02:35.405
<i> But families don’t heal</i>
<i>from something like that.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:38.241
<i>So I began to fantasize about a new one.</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:41.161
<i>If we were ever lucky enough to have it.</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:45.832
<i>When James died,</i>

02:45.915 --> 02:49.169
<i>I wondered if the family I had</i>
<i>was the only one I deserved.</i>

02:50.712 --> 02:52.130
And then I saw you.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.134
<i> I knew right away, in my gut,</i>

02:56.217 --> 02:58.469
<i>I recognized something in you. And, hey,</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:01.973
<i>smart, sexy, funny,</i>

03:02.056 --> 03:06.436
<i>a little darkness that made you</i>
<i>less storybook, more real.</i>

03:07.187 --> 03:09.397
<i>I started to fantasize again.</i>

03:10.481 --> 03:13.193
<i>When you pulled away,</i>
<i>I told myself, "I can fix him."</i>

03:15.278 --> 03:16.988
<i>For a while, it was working.</i>

03:17.071 --> 03:18.615
<i>I showed you how to heal.</i>

03:19.782 --> 03:22.535
<i>Oh, you were stronger than I knew.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:28.499
<i>I showed you what I wanted</i>
<i>by showing you what I didn’t want.</i>

03:29.125 --> 03:32.128
<i>When you stood by me, united,</i>

03:33.087 --> 03:36.049
<i>I knew together we could be better</i>
<i>than the family I was born into.</i>

03:39.093 --> 03:40.303
I wolf you.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.013
I wolf you too.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.477
Maybe I got a little obsessed.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.190
<i> Maybe I used my parents' means</i>
<i>to do a little digging after Candace left.</i>

03:54.776 --> 03:56.152
<i>They owed me that much.</i>

03:57.654 --> 04:00.531
<i>I devoured your dead ex’s book,</i>
<i>front to back.</i>

04:00.615 --> 04:02.909
<i>All the articles, all the think pieces,</i>

04:02.992 --> 04:04.535
<i>reading between the lines.</i>

04:04.619 --> 04:09.499
<i>And I realized,</i>
<i>Guinevere Beck was unspecial and mediocre.</i>

04:10.124 --> 04:11.751
She didn’t deserve you.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.684
<i> And then,</i>

04:28.476 --> 04:30.436
<i>I found the real you, Joe.</i>

04:31.771 --> 04:33.273
<i>You were even smarter,</i>

04:34.190 --> 04:37.068
<i>more passionate,</i>
<i>more devoted than I’d known.</i>

04:39.112 --> 04:41.030
<i>You’re crafty...</i>

04:42.657 --> 04:43.825
<i>and earthy.</i>

04:47.453 --> 04:49.914
<i>And it must be said, you bring out genius.</i>

04:49.998 --> 04:53.334
<i>Don’t think Beck could’ve written that</i>
<i>in a million years without your push.</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:56.421
<i>Yeah, you did some terrible things,</i>

04:57.171 --> 04:59.299
<i>but that’s what sensitive people do</i>
<i>when they’re trapped</i>

04:59.382 --> 05:00.842
<i>in a bad relationship.</i>

05:01.884 --> 05:03.720
<i>I tried to coax the real you out.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.098
<i>If you could trust me,</i>

05:07.181 --> 05:11.019
<i>show me your heart,</i>
<i>even the darkest parts,</i>

05:11.728 --> 05:14.522
<i>then we’d be starting our future together</i>
<i>on the right foot.</i>

05:14.605 --> 05:16.858
<i>But then, Delilah.</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:19.527
<i>She found out who you were and recoiled.</i>

05:19.902 --> 05:22.030
<i>You lost faith.</i>

05:22.405 --> 05:23.781
<i>You were gonna give up on us.</i>

05:24.365 --> 05:26.034
<i>Our little family in the making.</i>

05:26.576 --> 05:27.702
So I followed you.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.704
Take this.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.956
Give it to Delilah.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.375
And when you fuck her,

05:35.293 --> 05:37.420
you think of me. Okay?

06:17.126 --> 06:20.213
Oh, thank God!
Oh, please, you have to help me.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.341
Listen, Will is insane!

06:23.424 --> 06:26.344
-Oh, my God.
-These handcuffs, I think there's a key.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.512
I don't know if Will has it,

06:27.595 --> 06:29.305
or if there's a spare.
I really don't know.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.433
I promised him I wouldn't say anything
about what he did,

06:32.517 --> 06:34.310
but I really don't think he believes me,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.896
and so I really need your help.
I need to get out of here, please.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.607
He said he'd be back later.
He's high on something.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.193
Please, just hurry.
He'll hurt me, he'll hurt both of us.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.154
Just hurry. Please just help me
before he gets back.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.413
<i> I dealt with Delilah the same</i>
<i>way I dealt with the au pair.</i>

06:55.790 --> 06:58.334
<i>I’m protecting you because I want to, Joe.</i>

07:00.044 --> 07:01.421
You didn't break me.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.466
You opened your heart to me.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.180
We're soulmates, Joe.

07:13.766 --> 07:17.186
<i> What the fuck?</i>

07:25.903 --> 07:26.779
Joe?

07:28.906 --> 07:30.700
Please, say something.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.124
What about Ellie?

07:42.503 --> 07:45.047
Ellie? We have to talk about your sister.

07:50.928 --> 07:51.762
Hey.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.933
-It's okay, all right? I come in peace.
-At, like, three in the morning.

07:56.017 --> 07:56.934
I mean, come on.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.855
Do you know
Delilah's been getting death threats?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.024
Yeah, I do.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.569
And I was actually thinking<i> </i>that you might
be able to help me out with that.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.154
How?

08:09.405 --> 08:10.364
Uh...

08:11.949 --> 08:16.287
I don't know, just walk me through
some of the stuff around Henderson.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.081
Anything you might remember
that stands out.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
No detail too small.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.253
That sound chill?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.715
I know this routine
from every movie I've ever seen.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.384
You're trying to entrap me.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.844
<i> Ellie's gonna be fine.</i>

08:32.345 --> 08:34.430
And you don't think I would-- You know--

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
If I didn't have a plan for her.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.061
Oh, you have a plan?

08:40.561 --> 08:42.104
It's simple.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.901
First, we make Ellie a suspect
in Henderson's murder.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.028
-What?
-Don't judge yet, okay?

08:49.111 --> 08:50.196
Let me finish.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.989
Step one,

08:52.073 --> 08:56.953
we frame Ellie for Henderson's murder
with an anonymous tip.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.622
Love, tell me you didn't already do that.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.543
Where were you
the night Henderson was murdered, Ellie?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.588
Yeah, Delilah's been protecting you.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.050
Your texts with Henderson show
that he already had plans that night.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.680
And a new tip places you
in his house the night he died.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.598
I didn't do anything.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.517
I just wanna take you down to the station,

09:19.600 --> 09:20.977
ask you a few questions.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.437
<i> Step two</i>

09:23.521 --> 09:25.982
is lawyer her up
with the Quinn family's finest.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.025
Between the total lack of evidence

09:28.109 --> 09:30.987
and the fact
that she's a 15-year-old girl,

09:31.445 --> 09:33.281
it instantly becomes a joke.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.995
I'm letting you finish.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.747
Well...

09:42.957 --> 09:46.252
that's when Delilah's body
will be found with a suicide note.

09:47.003 --> 09:53.134
She becomes a posthumous feminist icon
for taking down her abuser.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
The shock waves will destroy the case.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.389
Ellie will walk free
with settlement money for life.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.309
She could even use this scandal
to jump-start her career.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.060
And most importantly,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.439
the investigation becomes poisoned.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.109
And you are never mentioned in connection
with Henderson again.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.487
That will never work.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.156
I mean, it wouldn't...

10:15.740 --> 10:17.908
if my family didn't basically own
the LAPD.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.162
It's the way the <i>au pair</i> got cleaned up.

10:21.245 --> 10:27.001
Ellie is going to emerge stronger,
smarter,

10:27.585 --> 10:29.420
-and better off.
-Like Forty?

10:29.503 --> 10:32.048
-Watch it.
-Okay, Ellie, then.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.676
What kind of sick mind
thinks forcing a teenager

10:35.760 --> 10:38.429
into the system is doing her a favor?

10:38.512 --> 10:41.140
If you have a better idea,
I'm open to that.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.559
I'm sorry, it's very hard to think clearly

10:43.643 --> 10:45.770
in the river of crazy you're spewing!

10:45.853 --> 10:47.688
Okay, get a grip.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.651
I thought you were the last person
who'd be hysterical.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.320
Hysterical? You killed Delilah!

10:54.403 --> 10:57.073
Because you killed a fucking celebrity.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.700
You know why this is happening?

11:00.117 --> 11:02.244
Because while I was seeing you,

11:02.620 --> 11:05.289
really seeing you,

11:05.873 --> 11:08.459
you were busy gazing at a goddamn fantasy.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.592
A perfectly imperfect girl.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
You saw what you wanted to see.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.809
But I was always right here,

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
the whole time.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.523
It wasn't that hard.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.484
You just had to look.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.414
Um...

11:47.415 --> 11:49.917
I have to finish making a wedding cake,
so...

11:51.210 --> 11:53.462
Love. Love! Wait, wait, wait! Please.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.965
Please, let me out.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.302
Love? Love!

12:08.018 --> 12:11.981
<i> A crazy person has locked me in</i>
<i>a cage, but now is not the time to panic.</i>

12:12.064 --> 12:12.940
<i>Ellie's in danger.</i>

12:13.023 --> 12:14.817
<i>Is she, though?</i>
<i>What if Love's plan is good?</i>

12:14.900 --> 12:18.612
<i>She sounded sincere. Slow down.</i>
<i>Think. Okay.</i>

12:18.696 --> 12:24.827
<i>Now... do I believe Love</i>
<i>has Ellie's best interests at heart?</i>

12:25.494 --> 12:29.665
<i>Nope. Okay. I have to get free.</i>
<i>That's clear. Simple. Impossible.</i>

12:29.749 --> 12:34.003
<i>I think I finally understand</i>
<i>what Beck went through.</i>

12:34.837 --> 12:36.964
<i>It </i>is <i>a lot to process.</i>

12:38.883 --> 12:41.385
<i>What did Beck do in this situation?</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:43.262
-<i> I love you.</i>
-<i> Right.</i>

12:43.345 --> 12:45.639
<i>She pretended to love me.</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:49.518
<i>All I ever wanted</i>
<i>from Beck was to be seen.</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:52.438
<i>Really seen and accepted.</i>

12:52.897 --> 12:55.900
<i>You saw me.</i>
<i>Even the parts I'm ashamed of.</i>

12:56.692 --> 13:01.113
<i>You're asking me to see you,</i>
<i>to love you.</i>

13:01.822 --> 13:03.908
<i>I don't know what to feel, Love.</i>

13:05.117 --> 13:06.243
<i>But I know what to do.</i>

13:06.660 --> 13:08.370
<i>Are you in trouble for the gun?</i>

13:08.954 --> 13:10.080
Not at all.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.666
So, we can be together forever?

13:17.880 --> 13:22.092
I love you so much, Joey. So, so much.

13:25.554 --> 13:29.225
<i>It isn't hard to convince somebody</i>
<i>you love them</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:31.477
<i>if you know what they want to hear.</i>

13:40.277 --> 13:41.487
Have a good one, mate.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.535
-D-FOL mobile production office.
-<i> Forty, thank God.</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:49.870
Listen, I’m at the police station
right now,

13:49.954 --> 13:51.705
and they're not letting me leave.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.332
I need you to bail me out

13:53.415 --> 13:55.292
or whatever you did
for Will and my sister.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.460
Wait, Ellie?

13:57.211 --> 13:58.754
-What did you do?
<i>-Nothing.</i>

13:58.838 --> 14:01.549
It has something to do with Henderson,
but I didn’t do anything.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.676
<i>This cop Delilah knows brought me here,</i>

14:03.759 --> 14:05.928
<i>and the guy who keeps trying</i>
<i>to ask me stuff,</i>

14:06.011 --> 14:07.513
<i>I think he’s a homicide detective.</i>

14:10.182 --> 14:12.434
Please. Delilah's missing.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.770
Can you just come down
to the Wilcox station?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.730
<i>No can do, I’m on the East Coast.</i>

14:17.356 --> 14:18.399
Are you serious?

14:18.482 --> 14:21.151
Sit tight, okay?
I'm gonna send Morris your way.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.195
<i>-Who’s Morris?</i>
-He's a family lawyer

14:23.279 --> 14:26.365
on call for DUIs, D and Ds,
and bailouts under $600K.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.700
He'll have you out in no time.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.327
Forty, things are getting weird.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.706
Hey, I promise. I’ve got your back, okay?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.416
Just say nothing,

14:35.499 --> 14:37.751
<i>act dumb, and don't drink anything,</i>

14:37.835 --> 14:39.628
'cause they'll steal your DNA.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.522
Dr. Nicky. Hi, I’m Forty Quinn,

14:58.606 --> 15:01.692
I'm the writer/producer
of the upcoming feature-length adaptation

15:01.775 --> 15:04.194
of Guinevere Beck’s <i>The Dark Face of Love,</i>
directed by Kathryn Bigelow--

15:04.278 --> 15:06.655
Yeah, that's great.
Could we just get to it, please?

15:07.239 --> 15:09.533
The only reason why I'm here
is because the warden made me.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.452
I'm assuming you bribed him.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.496
Okay, brass tacks. I like that.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.791
I'll just say it then.
I don't think you killed Guinevere Beck.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.251
No shit.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.089
Are you one of those fans,
the "Free Dr. Nicky" subreddit?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.760
Former patients, conspiracy nuts.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.554
Listen to me carefully.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.474
Nothing they say matters.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.684
They say that you're innocent.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.771
Don't you want to go free?

15:38.854 --> 15:39.855
No.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.943
I'm guilty of destroying my marriage,

15:44.026 --> 15:47.780
my wife, my kids.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.784
I didn't kill Beck, but I am guilty.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.703
I'm guilty of using her.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.580
And she's not the first. She's...

15:57.247 --> 15:59.875
She's the--
She's just the first to end up dead.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.420
No, I'm a bad person.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.715
I'm exactly where I deserve to be.

16:08.050 --> 16:13.097
Wow, this is... not what I pictured
when I was writing you.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.810
I expected more
of a wrongfully-convicted vibe.

16:17.893 --> 16:18.852
I've had all that.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.312
But by the grace of God,

16:20.396 --> 16:23.357
I've been given eyes to see things
a whole other way.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.986
You see, I've turned my body and my spirit

16:27.069 --> 16:30.030
-over to a higher power.
-Yeah, me too, bro. All the steps.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.573
I'm good, Mr. Quinn.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.536
You know why?
'Cause I'm walking with Christ.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.454
And if I repent,

16:37.955 --> 16:40.666
-I will be forgiven in the end.
-Meanwhile, there's a killer out there.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.752
Oh, there's evil everywhere in the world,
you see.

16:43.836 --> 16:48.090
But I prefer to deal with the evil
that I see in the mirror each day.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.842
Dope. Um...

16:50.050 --> 16:53.262
You're not curious
about the mystery patient of yours

16:53.345 --> 16:55.681
with the fake name
that could never be located?

16:55.764 --> 16:59.184
Yes, I read the subreddit, okay?
It's fucking research.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.146
I don't want to bring a whole media circus

17:02.229 --> 17:04.273
down on a guy
who's just trying to work his shit out.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.445
That...

17:10.029 --> 17:11.071
That's Paul Brown.

17:11.822 --> 17:15.659
Yeah. He told us his name was Will,
but his real name--

17:15.743 --> 17:16.577
Stop.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.873
If you're right,
you stay away from that man.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.333
No, no. We can stop him.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.085
No, no, no, no.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.378
If he killed Beck...

17:27.588 --> 17:30.215
there's no telling
what this man is capable of.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.802
What's done is done.
He'll be punished, but not by us.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.596
Trust in divine justice.

17:36.388 --> 17:40.559
Put your faith in the universe, man.
It's the only thing that'll set you free.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.936
Cool. Will do.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.229
One problem.

17:45.022 --> 17:49.568
He's dating my fucking sister, Reverend.

17:49.651 --> 17:54.239
So, why don't you just tell me everything
that you know?

17:54.823 --> 17:56.950
Or her death will be on you.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.291
God bless you, and God bless your sister.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.548
Fuck.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.551
<i> Amy turned me onto this memoir.</i>

18:14.635 --> 18:16.595
This, uh, main character, Beck.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.347
It's Joe.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.128
Shall we?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.550
See you soon, Ms. Alves.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.176
Yeah, have fun.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.471
Oh, and one more thing.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.016
Wherever your sister is,
she’s got 12 hours to show her face,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.853
or I’m calling CPS
on an unattended minor.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.104
You know,

19:07.437 --> 19:10.774
in addition to the missing persons report
I just filed.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.235
Can he do that?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.530
Let’s talk outside.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.719
Just give it a minute.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.888
It’s the Quinn family.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.849
Yeah, well,
they always have a lot going on.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.561
She might not stay
front of mind for too long.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.813
You know what?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.773
My schedule's clear.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.318
There's no harm in putting a tail on her.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.866
If I see anything fun, I'll call you.

20:45.827 --> 20:46.745
Muffins?

20:51.792 --> 20:55.254
Yeah, I, uh...
seem to remember owing you one.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.717
I didn't have time to make a religieuse.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.520
The first time I ever tasted a muffin...

21:13.021 --> 21:14.356
was in a group home.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.610
My mom never let me have one, ever.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.696
Wow, that's basically child abuse.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.449
And she said, "They're cupcakes, Joey.
Read the ingredients."

21:25.033 --> 21:26.952
Well, she wasn't wrong.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.039
-You never talk about her. Is she still--
-Alive?

21:31.915 --> 21:32.916
Around.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.257
She was a saint.

21:42.676 --> 21:43.885
I was a handful.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.139
It seems like you just wanted sugar
for breakfast.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.225
Like a normal kid.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.854
-At least you had her around back then.
-She did her best.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.781
What are--

22:06.283 --> 22:07.993
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:16.126 --> 22:17.544
Is this what you're afraid of?

22:18.712 --> 22:19.796
No poison, Joe!

22:19.880 --> 22:21.298
No, no no no. Love. Love?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.675
-You think I'm crazy.
-It's not that.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.303
No. I didn't want to say anything.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.512
About what?

22:27.971 --> 22:29.389
I can't eat food

22:29.473 --> 22:33.894
when there's a body rotting
three feet away from me.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.479
I do need to eat.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.400
Just open the cage.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.155
Only long enough for me to move her out.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.202
Love, I do trust you.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.039
I need you to trust me.

23:11.890 --> 23:12.724
I do.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.959
Joe. No!

23:40.460 --> 23:41.670
No, I'm pregnant!

23:51.263 --> 23:52.305
I'm pregnant.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.350
<i> Joey...</i>

23:55.934 --> 23:57.269
Joey, I know you're in there.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.645
Joseph.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.441
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.818
Why are you hiding, bub?

24:04.901 --> 24:06.820
He's here to take me away.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.114
Just... for a little while.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.452
I'm not... the best for you right now.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.079
What happened. This is better.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.126
Why did you let him come back
over and over again?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.130
So you could have a dad.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.674
You need a father.

24:27.757 --> 24:29.301
I only need you.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.678
I don't expect you to understand this,

24:32.262 --> 24:34.097
but a boy needs a strong man

24:34.473 --> 24:36.099
to teach him right from wrong.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.478
I tried to give you that, but I failed.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.689
What's wrong with you, it's my fault.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.274
I'm sorry.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.694
You needed a real father.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.076
<i> A father.</i>

24:56.411 --> 24:58.830
<i>I'm going to be a real father.</i>

24:58.914 --> 25:01.416
Are you sure it's...?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.251
I made Milo use protection.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.550
Joe.... Joe.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.684
Say something.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.104
Right.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.024
Right, you think I'm a psycho now.

25:27.817 --> 25:33.031
Did you actually believe
I wanted to hurt anyone?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.743
I hated doing that to Delilah.

25:36.826 --> 25:41.289
I'd just taken the test.
I had just found out.

25:41.581 --> 25:46.753
I mean, was I gonna let this destroy
our baby's life?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.214
My whole life...

25:51.508 --> 25:54.386
I've been doing what it takes...

25:56.721 --> 25:58.723
when I love someone.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.729
And I love you.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.942
I love you.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.405
I don't know what to say.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.865
Say, "Love, I get it."

26:16.366 --> 26:17.909
Say, "Love,

26:19.202 --> 26:24.082
we both had to learn how to survive
really young."

26:25.000 --> 26:27.168
I mean, how old were you the first time?

26:28.086 --> 26:28.920
Nine.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.714
I'm so sorry.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.303
You were just a child.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.804
So were you.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.306
So is she.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.682
She?

26:41.558 --> 26:42.809
It's just a feeling.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.061
<i> A daughter. A girl.</i>

26:45.645 --> 26:47.981
I was stupid to think
you would forgive me.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.818
I had to tell myself you would
so that I could go through with it.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.904
But you hate me now.

26:54.988 --> 26:55.989
Love...

26:59.159 --> 27:00.493
If you want to hate me...

27:03.788 --> 27:04.706
run...

27:06.958 --> 27:08.043
turn me in...

27:08.501 --> 27:09.461
hurt me...

27:11.921 --> 27:12.964
just fucking do it.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.016
I'm not gonna keep you here.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.562
<i> Candace said I'd face myself.</i>

27:28.021 --> 27:29.147
<i>Maybe this is it.</i>

27:30.982 --> 27:31.983
<i>Facing you.</i>

27:42.702 --> 27:43.578
This...

27:45.246 --> 27:48.500
It's not covered
in any sort of dating manual.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.210
That's very true.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.883
I understand if you can't love me anymore.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.220
Or don't want to.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.272
I do want to.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.566
Real love doesn't evaporate

28:14.150 --> 28:16.361
when things get hard.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.571
I will earn back your trust.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.409
I will do whatever it takes.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.329
Nothing is more important than this.

28:29.749 --> 28:33.503
Is it weird if I ask if you still want
to go to Lucy and Sunrise's wedding?

28:41.636 --> 28:45.432
<i>♪ Got my eyes on the face</i>

-Gabe! I need to speak to my sister.

Okay, then you are gonna
have to call her later.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.484
-who already has a girlfriend...

30:19.567 --> 30:22.904
<i>No one could accuse you</i>
<i>of being cold, Love.</i>

30:23.488 --> 30:24.739
<i>Of having no heart.</i>

30:24.823 --> 30:27.033
I remember the first time I saw you
at work.

30:27.742 --> 30:32.956
You were screaming at a studio exec,
like some goddess of destruction,

30:33.039 --> 30:34.833
and I was like...

30:35.917 --> 30:37.335
"She scares me.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.840
She will burn it all down
for what she cares about."

30:42.298 --> 30:46.344
That's the moment I saw what
and who you are.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.222
It's also the moment
I fell in love with you.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.558
My queen,

30:52.559 --> 30:56.354
together we will raise children
who fear nothing.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.024
Whose hearts are the size of the moon.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.569
And who are real and true.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.029
Like you.

31:06.781 --> 31:11.202
All I've ever wanted is to love
and be loved by someone real and true.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.537
<i> Me too.</i>

31:14.163 --> 31:15.123
You're my soulmate.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.166
- Yes, I am.
- Beautiful.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.793
<i> Is that what we are?</i>

31:19.502 --> 31:21.671
<i>-Soulmates?</i>
- I love you, baby.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.506
<i> Is this what real love is?</i>

31:24.090 --> 31:25.925
<i>Knowing and accepting anything.</i>

31:26.259 --> 31:27.969
I love you so much.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.849
-Your vows are better than mine.
-No, they weren't!

31:33.266 --> 31:35.852
-I mean it.
-<i>I </i>mean it.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.563
Well, by the power vested in me

31:38.646 --> 31:41.232
by the Divine Mother
and the state of California,

31:42.025 --> 31:43.943
I now pronounce you...

31:44.861 --> 31:46.112
married.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.322
-Ah!

31:51.451 --> 31:52.952
Go on, kiss her. Come on!

31:53.036 --> 31:54.579
- Do it!
- Kiss her!

32:00.501 --> 32:03.046
<i> We're having a little girl together.</i>

32:03.129 --> 32:07.425
<i>I am terrified,</i>
<i>but maybe that's how every parent feels. </i>

32:07.508 --> 32:11.387
<i>All I know is,</i>
<i>I can't protect her if I'm not there,</i>

32:11.471 --> 32:15.099
<i>and I won't be there if I can't love you.</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:16.017
What?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.102
I love you.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.105
You do?

32:21.689 --> 32:22.649
Yes.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.360
Still?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.196
More.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.341
Close the store and leave.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.427
-It's the middle of the day.
-Calvin, just...

32:51.970 --> 32:54.973
put up a "closed for inventory" sign
and get the fuck out.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.558
Whatever you say.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.812
Yeah, thanks for the tone. You're fired!

33:02.689 --> 33:03.564
Good.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.525
As a courtesy, I'll evacuate everyone

33:05.608 --> 33:08.444
before their pathetic junkie boss
fires them, too.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.166
Oh, my!

33:24.877 --> 33:29.048
Okay, okay, okay, you jerks.
You can totally turn on your phones now,

33:29.132 --> 33:31.509
and if we could gather
for the most gorgeous cake

33:31.592 --> 33:33.302
you've ever seen in your life,

33:33.386 --> 33:36.472
courtesy of Ms. Love Quinn.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.099
-Yeah!

33:59.370 --> 34:01.247
Okay, I'll go in, calm him down a little.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.041
Give me five minutes
then follow me, okay?

34:03.708 --> 34:04.917
Five minutes. Trust me.

34:18.973 --> 34:19.932
Ellie.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.310
Ellie, I've been worried.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.519
Don't come near me!

34:24.103 --> 34:26.689
What's going on?
Did Forty say something crazy about me?

34:26.773 --> 34:29.275
Because he's been doing that all day.
He's not in his right mind.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.527
You know me.

34:32.111 --> 34:34.697
Please, I can help.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.659
I don't know where to go.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.246
Cops are sending CPS to my house.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.082
Forty told me to meet him here,

34:44.165 --> 34:46.959
but he's in there ranting
on Love's voicemail,

34:47.043 --> 34:48.169
-and he's scary.
-It's okay.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.922
-Love and I are gonna take care of that.
-He's ranting about you,

34:51.005 --> 34:52.632
saying you killed Beck,

34:52.715 --> 34:55.426
and that you tried burying
someone named Candace alive.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.594
Does that sound like me?

34:56.677 --> 34:58.596
-Why would he think that?
-He's high.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.972
Where is my sister, Will?

35:01.933 --> 35:04.060
I don't care about the rest of it,
I don't.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.312
Where is Delilah?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.692
-Did you hurt her, Will?
-No.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.319
Then where is she?

35:17.031 --> 35:18.574
Ellie, this is my fault.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.744
The Quinns are very powerful,

35:22.662 --> 35:24.413
and they get away with evil things.

35:25.414 --> 35:26.874
I got wrapped up with them...

35:28.376 --> 35:29.335
and so did your sister.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.337
So, what?
They're, like, out of <i>The Godfather </i>now?

35:31.420 --> 35:35.716
Ellie,
I don't think Delilah is coming back.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.513
-What?
-I wish it was any other way,

35:40.596 --> 35:43.933
but we need to protect you
and get you away from them.

35:47.603 --> 35:49.230
-My sister...
-Is gone.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.402
You cannot go home.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.571
CPS is not great either.

35:59.907 --> 36:00.825
Come with me.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.084
-Look, you need to go.
-Okay, breathe.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.752
-No, listen.
-You're a little worked up.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.671
-Sit down!
-No, for the last time, I'm not high!

36:13.754 --> 36:14.630
I'm-- I'm not.

36:14.714 --> 36:15.882
Is Joe--

36:16.465 --> 36:17.967
Did you read my texts?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.636
You can't even finish a thought.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.097
No, okay, Love. I will say this nicely,

36:23.181 --> 36:25.808
I will do breathwork with you later.

36:25.892 --> 36:32.190
I have to save you from
a literal fucking serial killer first.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.691
I'm handling it.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.193
Please, go.

36:36.694 --> 36:37.528
Okay.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.781
I trust you. Whatever you want, I'll go.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.575
But before I do,

36:43.618 --> 36:45.203
just for my peace of mind...

36:47.580 --> 36:48.831
walk me through the plan?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.421
Okay, take this.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.257
Go out the side doors
in case someone follows you.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.551
Go to Union Station, get on a train east.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.928
Keep going east, okay?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.721
-When you get where you're going, call me.
-Where am I going?

37:03.804 --> 37:06.015
-To start your life.
-I have a life.

37:07.016 --> 37:10.478
Ellie, you are one of the smartest people
I've ever met.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.104
-You can do this.
-Do what?

37:12.188 --> 37:13.898
Start over.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.691
Find a city.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.860
-Florida might be a good place to start.
-I'm 15.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.779
Basically 16, right?

37:19.862 --> 37:22.365
When you get there,
I will help you get legal ID.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.909
I will send you money
as long as you need it.

37:24.992 --> 37:25.952
I will not abandon you.

37:26.035 --> 37:29.330
-Then what the fuck is this?
-This is what we need to do!

37:32.750 --> 37:33.584
I hate you.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.629
You brought the Quinns into our lives,

37:37.004 --> 37:38.881
and you're the reason Delilah's gone.

37:42.468 --> 37:43.886
Dead, right?

37:45.221 --> 37:46.097
She's dead?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.057
I'm sorry, Ellie.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.851
And now you come in here
acting like some kind of hero?

37:51.727 --> 37:53.813
Well, fuck you. Fuck you!

37:53.896 --> 37:56.607
I am not a hero. Believe me.
You want the truth?

37:57.608 --> 37:59.151
I killed Henderson,

37:59.277 --> 38:00.945
and I don't feel guilty about it.

38:01.028 --> 38:04.490
What I am is all that stands between you
and people who are worse.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.158
Now let me help you.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.372
You ruined my life.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.959
I am truly sorry. Side door.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.137
Burn in hell.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.100
<i> She should hate me.</i>

38:31.642 --> 38:33.728
<i>But as long as she's safe.</i>

38:34.228 --> 38:36.355
<i>Is this what fatherhood feels like?</i>

38:37.315 --> 38:38.941
<i> Why are you protecting him?</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:41.777
Why aren't you listening to me?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.238
Because you let people
get in your head, Forty.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.032
No... no.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.035
I have cracked this, okay?
I can see the Matrix,

38:49.118 --> 38:51.704
and it is exactly what Candace tried
to tell us.

38:51.787 --> 38:52.955
Look around him.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.999
People disappear.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.917
People die in weird fucking ways.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.628
First, it was Beck and her friends,

38:59.712 --> 39:02.006
and now Ellie's sister is missing.

39:02.089 --> 39:06.260
Henderson was murdered,
and we had just been at his house.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.055
-All right? Look, Candace told--
-Candace was crazy!

39:09.555 --> 39:11.891
Listen to yourself,
you sound like a conspiracy nutjob.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.184
You have blind spots.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.728
Joe, he's in your blind spot.

39:15.811 --> 39:20.566
He is a blood-thirsty wolf
in your blind spot.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.946
Joe, you're late.

39:26.447 --> 39:29.408
-Come in.
-Joe, you can just wait outside--

39:29.492 --> 39:30.576
No, no.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.912
I insist.

39:34.205 --> 39:38.793
Here's the deal. Our family,
we can make your life a living hell.

39:39.085 --> 39:43.214
We can get you sent to prison.
And we can do a lot fucking worse.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.883
Okay, well, I don't know what it is
you think I did,

39:45.966 --> 39:48.552
so tell me, and we can talk about it.

39:48.636 --> 39:53.140
Which part? The part
where you have a pattern of lying

39:53.891 --> 39:57.436
and stalking and killing in general?

39:58.020 --> 40:01.649
Or the part where you fixated
on my sister?

40:01.732 --> 40:03.484
I will never hurt Love.

40:03.567 --> 40:06.779
-You are never going to get to.
-Okay, this is enough.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.990
Okay? Joe, we can let him simmer down.

40:10.074 --> 40:10.950
-No, Forty!
-Hey!

40:11.033 --> 40:12.993
-Stand back.
-Oh, my God. Put that away!

40:13.077 --> 40:16.497
-Don't be insane!
-This is the sanest I have ever been.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.792
You protect me, I protect you.

40:19.875 --> 40:23.295
Forty... let's talk.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.756
Joe, if you take another step,
I will shoot you.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.260
Love, for the last time, go.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.388
You don't want to hurt him.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.889
Yes, I do.

40:33.973 --> 40:37.893
And if you would listen to me,
you would understand why I have to.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.814
Forty, if you do this,
I will never forgive you.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.066
You will never see me again

40:44.358 --> 40:45.401
or the baby.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.573
Our baby.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.243
A little girl.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.080
-You're...?
-Yeah.

40:58.706 --> 41:02.084
Do you actually think
I would let Joe near me

41:02.168 --> 41:03.919
if I didn't think, in my heart,

41:04.003 --> 41:06.547
that he was worthy of being a part
of our family?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.341
What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:09.425 --> 41:13.679
You would bring a child
into this world like... like us?

41:13.762 --> 41:16.474
-That is your shitty self-esteem talking.
-No.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.606
You are just as broken as I am.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.650
You're just a much better liar.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.027
Jesus, Love...

41:28.486 --> 41:29.695
you think I don't know?

41:29.778 --> 41:34.617
After all of these years,
you really think that I am that dumb?

41:35.201 --> 41:37.870
That I don't know what you're capable of?

41:37.953 --> 41:43.626
I have tip-toed around it my entire life,

41:44.376 --> 41:47.004
and it has eaten me alive.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.089
I love you,

41:50.090 --> 41:52.259
but you are crazy

41:52.676 --> 41:55.054
if you think that you would be
a good mother.

41:56.805 --> 42:01.101
Forty, don't punish your sister
because you're angry with me.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.561
You're right,

42:02.645 --> 42:05.523
I have done terrible things...

42:07.024 --> 42:08.025
in the past.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.904
What I care about now is her

42:11.987 --> 42:13.155
and our child

42:14.615 --> 42:15.449
and you.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.160
You think...

42:19.620 --> 42:24.083
that knocking up my sister
makes you a new person?

42:29.213 --> 42:30.089
No.

42:32.883 --> 42:33.759
I don't.

42:33.842 --> 42:38.138
- No.
-Get on your knees, psycho.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.516
Forty...

42:46.981 --> 42:51.443
<i>Dostoevsky contended</i>
<i>the bad want to be punished.</i>

42:51.527 --> 42:53.279
-Forty, please.
-Stay back, Love.

42:53.362 --> 42:56.031
I said, stay back.

43:01.870 --> 43:03.706
<i>If the bad are not caught,</i>

43:03.789 --> 43:05.749
<i>they'll seek out their own punishment,</i>

43:06.125 --> 43:07.418
<i>one way or another.</i>

43:11.380 --> 43:12.673
Close your eyes, Joe.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.726
<i>At least some punishment is quick.</i>

43:35.779 --> 43:36.989
<i> Oh, no.</i>

43:41.452 --> 43:42.328
Oh, no.

43:45.748 --> 43:49.376
<i>And some punishment will never end.</i>

43:49.460 --> 43:50.502
Are you two okay?

43:51.754 --> 43:54.757
Oh, my God.
If I was one second later...

43:56.342 --> 43:58.510
Officer involved in a shooting. Man down.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.847
Send an ambulance to Anavrin.
I need a sergeant to respond.

44:01.930 --> 44:05.017
- Forty...
-<i> I saw the moment you knew...</i>

44:05.684 --> 44:07.227
<i>your brother was gone,</i>

44:07.895 --> 44:09.146
<i>and I saw you look at me.</i>

44:12.107 --> 44:15.069
<i>I knew, in that moment,</i>
<i>that you needed me</i>

44:15.569 --> 44:18.238
<i>like I've never been needed,</i>
<i>and you always will. </i>

44:18.322 --> 44:22.076
<i>Sometimes, a man gets exactly</i>
<i>what he wishes for,</i>

44:24.119 --> 44:27.122
<i>and that can be</i>
<i>the most perfect punishment of all.</i>

44:34.505 --> 44:36.131
No!

44:37.675 --> 44:39.343
No!

44:48.644 --> 44:52.564
<i> So, karma and I, we're in a fight.</i>

44:53.315 --> 44:55.901
<i>Some people, they get what they deserve.</i>

44:57.319 --> 44:58.487
<i>Some people don't.</i>

45:03.200 --> 45:05.369
<i>And each day that passes,</i>

45:06.704 --> 45:11.041
<i>justice seems more and more</i>
<i>like a literary conceit.</i>

45:23.554 --> 45:29.268
<i>In </i>Crime and Punishment,
<i>the hero willingly walks into exile.</i>

45:29.810 --> 45:32.396
<i>He is killed, but he's also found love.</i>

45:33.272 --> 45:35.524
<i>And if he repents, he can be redeemed.</i>

45:35.607 --> 45:38.193
<i>He and the woman he loves can be saved.</i>

46:31.538 --> 46:37.252
<i> You can't save someone from</i>
<i>themselves. We wanted to... with Forty.</i>

46:37.336 --> 46:39.129
<i>The grief was rough at first,</i>

46:39.213 --> 46:42.257
<i>but his last gift to me</i>
<i>was when heroic Officer Fincher</i>

46:42.341 --> 46:44.343
<i>started to look at him</i>
<i>for Henderson's murder.</i>

46:45.719 --> 46:50.974
<i>The Quinn machine shut it down,</i>
<i>made any future investigation radioactive.</i>

46:51.058 --> 46:53.060
<i>Side effect wiped my slate clean.</i>

46:55.103 --> 46:57.940
<i>Not that the real slate can ever be clean.</i>

47:01.985 --> 47:04.696
<i>But it's hard to stay sad...</i>

47:05.823 --> 47:07.407
<i>when there's new life growing.</i>

47:13.539 --> 47:15.874
<i>And here I am.</i>

47:15.958 --> 47:18.168
<i>No one can absolve me.</i>

47:19.336 --> 47:20.921
<i>I gotta do the time.</i>

47:31.849 --> 47:34.518
<i>Not every Siberia is cold.</i>

47:34.601 --> 47:38.063
<i>Some are 73 and sunny</i>
<i>with eco-conscious landscaping.</i>

47:43.110 --> 47:45.529
<i>I'm ready to meet my daughter.</i>

47:46.113 --> 47:48.699
<i>I'm ready to be the good father</i>
<i>I never had.</i>

47:48.949 --> 47:50.909
<i>To make the family I always dreamed of.</i>

47:50.993 --> 47:52.619
<i>The one she deserves.</i>

47:53.287 --> 47:55.330
<i>It's funny how fate works.</i>

47:55.414 --> 48:00.752
<i>I had no idea that the cage I was building</i>
<i>all this time was a trap for me.</i>

48:00.836 --> 48:05.257
<i>And when I found myself here, locked in,</i>
<i>I thought this was the end.</i>

48:13.181 --> 48:15.517
<i> But that's not how destiny</i>
<i>works, is it?</i>

48:16.351 --> 48:19.104
<i>This is just the beginning...</i>

48:20.522 --> 48:24.276
<i>because this is where I had to be,</i>
<i>exactly...</i>

48:25.235 --> 48:26.987
<i>where I had to be to meet...</i>

48:27.779 --> 48:28.614
<i>you.</i>

48:29.031 --> 48:30.198
<i>There you were,</i>

48:30.282 --> 48:33.493
<i>with your books and your sunshine.</i>

48:33.577 --> 48:37.164
<i>So close, but worlds away.</i>

48:37.789 --> 48:41.251
<i>I will figure out a way,</i>
<i>a way to get to you.</i>

48:42.586 --> 48:44.880
<i>See you soon... neighbor.</i>

49:46.608 --> 49:48.360
