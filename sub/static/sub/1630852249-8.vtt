WEBVTT

00:04.120 --> 00:05.920
"End of Act One."

00:13.560 --> 00:16.120
KNOCK AT DOOR

00:13.560 --> 00:16.120
Come in.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.040
Why aren't you at breakfast?

00:23.040 --> 00:25.200
Well, look! It won't stop itching.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.360
It must have been that stage
make-up I used for the play.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.760
I can't possibly go to breakfast
looking like this.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.120
Do you have a fever at all?

00:32.120 --> 00:34.000
I have felt a little flushed,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.080
but that's just because I've been
racing around nonstop.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.760
Isn't there some kind of lotion
you can give me?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.280
Oh, it's far too late for that,
I'm afraid.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.200
What do you mean? Well, according to
your health certificate,

00:45.200 --> 00:47.760
you have never had the measles.
Oh, do you mean to say that...?

00:47.760 --> 00:50.080
Yes, I'm afraid it's straight
to bed for you, young lady.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.680
The last thing I need is another
outbreak on my hands.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.160
Sorry to bother you, Matron.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.840
Oh, Mr Parker! It's just,
I'm running a slight fever.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.800
Hello, Georgina.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.200
I'm sorry, I...

01:26.080 --> 01:28.120
I just wanted to say...

01:28.120 --> 01:30.160
..about the play...

01:30.160 --> 01:32.520
..that thought it was very good.
DOOR OPENS

01:33.800 --> 01:35.320
Shouldn't you be in the sanatorium?

01:35.320 --> 01:38.120
Georgina's not well.
Matron sent me back to class.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.800
Goodness!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.360
What on earth could be wrong?

01:41.360 --> 01:44.600
Um, Matron said something
about spots. Might be measles.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.680
Oh, it'll be acne.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.400
I've heard it can leave terrible
scars. I must go and see her.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.160
You can't.
Matron said no girls are to enter

01:52.160 --> 01:55.000
under any circumstances. Oh, bother!

01:55.000 --> 01:57.440
I've only gone and forgotten
my Latin prep.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.840
You go ahead.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.000
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

02:03.440 --> 02:05.240
DOOR CLOSES

02:07.120 --> 02:09.320
SNORING

02:16.040 --> 02:18.000
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

02:21.720 --> 02:23.880
Ah, Mr Parker, I was wondering if...

02:23.880 --> 02:25.240
Um...

02:25.240 --> 02:27.400
Um...

02:27.400 --> 02:28.960
What is this exactly?

02:30.320 --> 02:34.000
Well, I was so inspired by your
Summit of Love for Open Day.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.240
I was quite swept up by the drama
you wrote.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.560
I felt compelled to try my hand

02:40.560 --> 02:42.280
at one.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.760
And, uh, what is the play about?

02:44.760 --> 02:48.960
The school matron. Torn between
her love for a dashing count

02:48.960 --> 02:52.000
and her lifelong devotion
to the girls in her charge.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.040
I look forward to hearing
what you think.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.400
SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

03:10.680 --> 03:12.400
Welcome back.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.040
Mr Parker has been taking sick,
which means

03:17.040 --> 03:20.800
it has been left to me to cover
his class, but now I find out

03:20.800 --> 03:24.080
Mr Grayling has an appointment
with her solicitor, which means

03:24.080 --> 03:27.040
I will also have to cover
all the fifth-form girls.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.600
As I can't be at two places at once,

03:29.600 --> 03:33.360
Sally will have to cover this class
in my absence.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.760
I expect you to treat her
as you would any teacher.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.680
You can count on us,
Mam'zelle Rougier.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.320
I have a list of work for you

03:41.320 --> 03:43.360
to complete by the end
of the day.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.080
Once all these tasks are completed,

03:45.080 --> 03:47.640
I'd like you all to tidy
the classroom. C'est compris?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.680
ALL: Yes, Mam'zelle.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.240
It looks like we've got a busy day
ahead of us,

03:55.240 --> 03:56.680
so shall we get started?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.640
You heard Miss Hope.
Let's get to work.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.160
Georgina! I came as soon
as I heard the terrible news.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.520
Is it really that bad?
Haven't you seen?

04:20.520 --> 04:22.840
It's just as well
I came prepared.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.600
Your beautiful mirror. Oh!

04:24.600 --> 04:27.520
I knew you'd be positively lost
without it.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.640
I'm so sorry for leaving you
in the lurch with the play.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.400
Can you ever forgive me?

04:37.160 --> 04:40.960
Gwendolyn Mary Lacey, the sanatorium
is strictly out of bounds.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.280
I'm sorry, Matron. I just couldn't
bear the idea

04:43.280 --> 04:45.200
of poor Georgina being here
on her own.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.000
You stay exactly where you are.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.720
Tut!

04:52.720 --> 04:55.880
Oh, the writing on your health
certificate is all smudged.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.920
I can't make sense of it,
which means

04:57.920 --> 05:00.360
I'm going to have to telephone
your parents to find out

05:00.360 --> 05:04.000
if you've ever had the measles.
The measles? Because if you haven't,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.480
there's every chance you've caught
it now from Georgina here.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.120
Don't even think about leaving
this room. Do you understand me?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.640
I do not want you spreading it
to the rest of the girls.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.360
Never mind.
A little bit of rest and relaxation

05:16.360 --> 05:18.080
will do me the world of good.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.320
I think you underestimate
just how serious the measles can be.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.320
Perhaps a bun and some cocoa
would be a useful distraction.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.280
I've a much better idea.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.640
I want this floor so clean
I can see my face in it.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.000
SHE CHUCKLES

05:45.000 --> 05:47.200
And do not disturb Mr Parker.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.320
Shall I hand out the worksheets,
Miss Hope? Yes, thank you, Alicia.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.080
Why are you being so helpful?

05:58.080 --> 06:00.720
Because the sooner we finish
this work, the sooner we can all go

06:00.720 --> 06:04.200
to the beach. The beach?
There's no way I'm staying in today.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.360
Thank you.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.760
AH, Miss Hope, I've finished.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.120
Well, then, can you get started
on your Latin comprehension, please?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.040
I finished that too.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.040
How is everyone else getting on?

06:40.040 --> 06:42.960
I only started Latin
when I came here.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.880
I have a lot to catch up on.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.680
I just need you to do some quiet
reading so the rest of us

06:50.680 --> 06:53.280
can catch up. But that's not fair.
Mam'zelle Rougier left me

06:53.280 --> 06:55.880
with a strict set of instructions...
Poppycock!

06:55.880 --> 06:58.640
You can't let us stay inside on such
a beautiful day.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.400
Alicia!

07:00.400 --> 07:01.960
Come on, Sally.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.000
We can just SAY we did the work.
Mam'zelle doesn't need to know

07:06.000 --> 07:08.920
we snuck out early. Mam'zelle
put her trust in me, Alicia.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.440
Don't be a stick in the mud. You're
not the one who'll get into trouble.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.480
So you're not going to let us leave?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.160
No, not unless you're sick.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.200
Now, can the rest of you get on
with your work, please?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.360
CLATTER
Oh, that is just splendid, isn't it?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.520
Special delivery.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.680
For me?! How lovely!

07:40.840 --> 07:42.760
They're for Georgina.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.080
Oh, Daddy's here to look over
the grounds.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.520
Thankfully, he's already
had the measles, so I've said

07:49.520 --> 07:52.000
that he can visit you
in the sanatorium garden

07:52.000 --> 07:54.640
just as soon as he's finished
his survey.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.880
I expect Daddy will want to
finalise plans for my birthday!

07:57.880 --> 08:00.160
I'm having a summer ball, you know.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.040
A summer ball?!

08:02.040 --> 08:04.000
How positively delightful!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It'll only be a small affair.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.840
Just a few hundred
of my closest friends.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.560
Will it be at your house in France?

08:10.560 --> 08:12.280
Yes. We'll open up the ballroom

08:12.280 --> 08:14.800
so we can take full advantage
of the sea view.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.720
What I wouldn't give
to attend a society party.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.720
MATRON CLEARS HER THROAT

08:20.720 --> 08:23.640
This floor isn't going to mop
itself, you know.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
It might even help my recovery,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.960
knowing I had something to live for.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.560
Subtlety isn't your strong suit,
Gwen.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.880
I'm sorry?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.160
I will have to look over the guest
list,

08:36.160 --> 08:37.920
but I'll certainly consider it.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.240
Well, if it means THAT much to you,
it would be churlish of me

08:41.240 --> 08:42.600
not to accept.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.360
I'm going to try your mother again.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.840
BELL RINGS
Alicia, where were you at lunch?

09:02.840 --> 09:06.280
Class is about to start.
I'm sorry, I just felt very weak.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.560
I've had enough of your silly games.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.040
Oh, my goodness. Your face.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.640
Wh-what is it? You've come out in
the most terrible rash.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.480
Oh, that'll explain my temperature.
I'm burning up.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.680
I should fetch Matron. No, no!

09:19.680 --> 09:21.800
I'll just rest here
for the afternoon.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.000
At least let me fetch me you
a cold flannel.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.360
No, I'm sure I'll be fine after...
SHE COUGHS

09:26.360 --> 09:29.080
..a few hours' sleep.
You've got a temperature.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.560
This should take it down.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.200
Thank you. I feel much better now.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.080
I KNEW you were faking it!
I had to do SOMETHING to get

09:41.080 --> 09:43.600
out of your boring lessons!
And now we're late for class!

09:43.600 --> 09:45.360
You really are a rotter, Alicia!

09:45.360 --> 09:47.880
Come on! Sally!
Oh, Sally!

09:48.920 --> 09:52.000
Wait. Alicia... I'm just getting
my shoes! Let's go! Now!

09:52.000 --> 09:53.440
Oh!

09:54.760 --> 09:56.400
I'm writing a list to your father

09:56.400 --> 09:58.640
about how he can improve
Malory Towers.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.080
Number one - expel Darrell Rivers,
of course.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.280
And I really do think he should do
something about the consistency

10:05.280 --> 10:07.680
of the porridge.
My father is a businessman.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.120
He doesn't know the first thing
about running a school.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.880
Then, why on earth would he
invest all that money?

10:14.160 --> 10:18.280
It seems you haven't been forgotten,
after all. A gift from Mary-Lou.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.280
Bless Mary-Lou.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.320
She really is such a dear friend.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.920
She's kindly lent you
her French textbook.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.800
We can't have you falling behind,
now, can we?

10:27.800 --> 10:30.760
Your father should be on his way
to the sanatorium garden,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.280
if you are ready to go and meet him.
Very much!

10:33.280 --> 10:37.000
You are to remain in the garden
at all times. Is that understood?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.320
Perhaps I should accompany Georgina.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.360
You are not going anywhere.
Sit down.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.960
Excuse me, Mr Parker.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.520
I need to try Mrs Lacey again.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.480
Of course, Matron. OK.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.960
Hello, it's Matron here.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.280
MATRON TALKS INDISTINCTLY

11:15.600 --> 11:17.040
Daddy!

11:19.760 --> 11:22.280
We were so worried
when Matron telephoned.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.720
How are you feeling? I'm all right,
apart from these dreadful spots.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.280
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure
they'll clear up in time

11:28.280 --> 11:30.680
for your birthday.
And with any luck, by then,

11:30.680 --> 11:32.800
we'll both have something
to celebrate.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.280
Why? What's happened?
Take a look at this.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.560
What is it?

11:38.560 --> 11:42.040
This is kaolin,
otherwise known as china clay.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.480
Do you have any idea
what this means?

11:44.480 --> 11:47.680
We are standing on a small fortune.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.520
Oh, that's good, isn't it?

11:49.520 --> 11:52.280
It means Miss Grayling doesn't
have to worry about money any more.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.320
It's not quite as simple as that.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.840
The seam runs
directly under the school.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.400
The only way to get to it is
to demolish Malory Towers.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.720
What?!

12:01.720 --> 12:03.360
Oh, Daddy!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.800
I take no pleasure from it.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.440
You don't understand. The girls
will be absolutely furious with me.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.480
Look, you can't afford
to be sentimental when it comes

12:15.480 --> 12:17.080
to business, Georgina.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.560
Get well soon.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.040
Bye-bye, Daddy.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.760
Could everyone make a start on
their Latin comprehension, please?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.280
We've wasted enough time
as it is.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.560
Now, please, sit down, Alicia.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.720
I've had enough of you bossing me
about, Sally Hope.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.000
Fine.
Then, go stand in the corridor.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.280
You want me to leave?
Yes, if you can't behave.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.440
You heard her, everyone. Miss Hope
said we can all leave if we want to.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.760
No, I didn't say that.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.280
No, wait. Please don't go!
Mam'zelle set us work.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.320
Last one to the beach is a rotten
tomato!

12:51.320 --> 12:53.040
No! Thank you, Sally. Come back!

12:53.040 --> 12:56.120
LAUGHTER

12:53.040 --> 12:56.120
Wait for me!

13:14.840 --> 13:16.400
DOOR OPENS

13:20.440 --> 13:23.040
Did you have a lovely time
with your father?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.400
Not really.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.640
Daddy had the most dreadful news.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.960
Is it anything I can help it?

13:29.960 --> 13:32.840
You wouldn't understand.
It's to do with his business.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.400
Actually, I know all about clay.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.240
We studied it in our first term.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.640
You were listening
to our conversation?!

13:40.720 --> 13:43.880
No, I went to the garden
to say thank you to your father

13:43.880 --> 13:47.280
for saving the school.
You really are the most dreadful

13:47.280 --> 13:49.080
busybody, Gwendolyn Lacey!

13:49.080 --> 13:52.360
Well, at least I'm not a deceitful
beast like your father.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.960
I beg your pardon?

13:55.040 --> 13:58.080
You're right, of course, the other
girls would NEVER forgive you

13:58.080 --> 14:00.680
if they knew
what your father had planned.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.120
You're not...you're not going to
say anything, are you?

14:03.120 --> 14:05.640
I couldn't possibly keep
such a terrible secret

14:05.640 --> 14:06.760
like that to myself.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.240
It's just, my father was going
to suggest that your mother came

14:11.240 --> 14:15.240
to my summer ball, too. He did
so enjoy meeting her at open day.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.600
You'd be such lovely guests.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.400
So, let's say no more about this,
then, shall we?

14:57.800 --> 15:01.840
Matron, it's imperative
that I'm discharged immediately.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.280
I have a very important matter
to deal with.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.480
Absolutely not. I've still
to confirm your medical records.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.520
You don't understand. The future
of Malory Towers is at stake.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.800
Not another word.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.520
Matron, could you at least give
Mary-Lou the textbook

15:28.520 --> 15:30.160
that she's so kindly lent me?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.640
I'd hate for her to fall behind
on her prep. Right.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.600
Hurry up, then.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.880
Honestly. You girls
and your histrionics.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.720
Anyone would think Malory Towers
was about to fall apart around us!

15:49.440 --> 15:52.880
Right... Thank you both
for staying and helping to clean up.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.080
No problem!

15:56.440 --> 15:59.000
THEY GIGGLE, DOOR OPENS

15:59.000 --> 16:00.960
Where are the rest of the girls?

16:03.040 --> 16:06.120
I let them go swimming as a reward
for their hard work.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.600
If I didn't know better,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.720
I would think you were covering
for your friends.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.800
I am willing to overlook it...

16:18.080 --> 16:22.040
..but I will not stand for any
more nonsense from you girls.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.680
C'est compris? Yes.
Yes, Mam'zelle.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.720
Ah, Mary-Lou!
Excuse me, Miss Rougier,

16:29.720 --> 16:32.920
but Gwendolyn said that Mary-Lou
would need this for her prep.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.880
I believe there is a note of thanks
inside. Thank you, Matron.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.120
Matrone, how is Monsieur Parker?

16:40.120 --> 16:43.280
Oh, do not worry, Miss Rougier,
I'm taking very good care of him.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.040
I can't believe we got away with it.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.960
That's because Sally's a jolly
good sport. She could have easily

16:47.960 --> 16:50.800
got Alicia and Irene into trouble.
Thank you.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.640
Come on.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.240
Time for tea.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.000
This isn't a thank-you note.
What does it say?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.960
"Urgent.
I've found out something terrible."

17:02.960 --> 17:04.880
What on earth can Gwen mean?

17:16.360 --> 17:18.880
Has Mr Parker been asking for me?

17:20.880 --> 17:24.520
Mm, well, I shan't disturb him,
then.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.920
You did give Mary-Lou her book back
for me, didn't you?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.000
Oh, I said I would.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.680
Now, get some rest.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.720
You girls have worn me
out today. Oh...

17:54.360 --> 17:56.560
MATRON SNORES

18:19.360 --> 18:21.880
MATRON CHUCKLES

18:31.360 --> 18:34.080
"Mr Thomas plans to mine
the land..."

18:34.080 --> 18:36.680
"..and demolish Malory Towers"?!

18:36.680 --> 18:39.400
Oh, my goodness!
We have to tell Miss Grayling!

18:40.760 --> 18:43.160
Thank you, Gwen. Let's go.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.920
BELL RINGS

18:52.920 --> 18:55.120
LOUD YAWNING

19:02.440 --> 19:05.320
Oh! Mary-Lou! Sorry!

19:09.040 --> 19:12.080
Why are you girls running
in the corridor?

19:12.080 --> 19:13.920
We need to speak to Miss Grayling.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.760
I have already warned you, girls...
You don't understand.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.160
Mr Thomas doesn't want to save
Malory Towers -

19:19.160 --> 19:20.880
he wants to destroy it. Pardon?!

19:22.080 --> 19:24.560
That is a very serious allegation
you're making.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.360
Where did you hear this? From Gwen.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.920
Oh. And where did Gwen hear this
exactly?

19:31.280 --> 19:34.040
Um, we're...we're not quite certain.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.000
I'm sure Gwen wouldn't want to lie
about something so important.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.920
I will be the judge of that.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.160
You'll talk to Miss Grayling?
I most certainly will.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.040
Oh, thank you, Mam'zelle.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.960
How's everything, Mam'zelle?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.720
Tres bien, Miss Grayling.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.400
But I tell you, the second-form
girls, they make trouble as usual.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.600
Oh, dear. Is there something
I should be concerned about?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.840
Just a tall tale from
Gwendolyn Lacey,

20:01.840 --> 20:04.160
still in the grips of a fever,
no doubt.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.160
Nothing for you to worry about.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.400
Mr Parker, have you had time to...?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.760
Um...

20:24.320 --> 20:25.680
Um...

20:25.680 --> 20:29.400
Oh, please, don't keep me in
suspense. What did you think of it?

20:31.280 --> 20:35.040
You really are a credit to the
school, Matron. And the care

20:35.040 --> 20:36.840
you show the girls is exemplary.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
The hours you spend tending
to their every demand,

20:40.880 --> 20:45.320
however trivial, however important,
is an example

20:45.320 --> 20:47.520
to all the teaching staff.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.080
And...

20:54.840 --> 20:56.760
Mr Parker, open up, please.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.120
Am I to understand

21:04.120 --> 21:07.400
you feel my talents are best served
helping the girls?

21:15.280 --> 21:17.560
97 degrees Fahrenheit, precisely.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.120
I think we can safely rule out
the measles.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.720
I think I'd better
just collect my things.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.440
PHONE RINGS

21:30.040 --> 21:34.720
Matron speaking. Ah, Mrs Lacey,
thank you for returning my call.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.120
Oh, she has, has she?

21:38.120 --> 21:39.680
Many thanks.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.000
These girls are endless trouble,
aren't they, Mr Parker?

21:54.400 --> 21:57.600
But we do always teach them
to be honest, do we not?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.120
Indeed, we do.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.520
Thank you.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.280
Gwendolyn Mary Lacey, pack up
your bag and return

22:08.280 --> 22:09.880
to the dormitory immediately.

22:12.760 --> 22:16.160
As your friend will be here
for a few more days yet,

22:16.160 --> 22:19.080
but I have no doubt
she'll make a full recovery.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.160
Is it true they want
to demolish the school?

22:43.160 --> 22:46.920
Yes, Gwen told us.
Gwen saved the school?

22:46.920 --> 22:48.840
LAUGHTER

22:48.840 --> 22:51.200
Gwen! What are you doing back here?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.480
Turns out I've already had
the measles.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.600
Oh, we told Mam'zelle Rougier
about Mr Thomas.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.960
We can't thank you enough, Gwen.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.480
I'm only pleased I was able
to play a small part

22:59.480 --> 23:01.040
in saving the school.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.040
What do you suppose will happen now?

23:03.040 --> 23:06.160
Miss Grayling will have to find
another investor, I suppose.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.960
DOOR OPENS

23:06.160 --> 23:07.960
What a rotten day!

23:07.960 --> 23:11.120
Irene got stung by a wasp
and my towel blew into the sea.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.120
Did anyone find out we sneaked out?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.280
Mam'zelle asked,
but Sally covered for you.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.160
Sally, I'm sorry I was a beast.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.520
The beach would have been a lot
more fun if you'd all been there.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.880
Uh, have you all seemed to have
forgotten that we'd all be standing

23:25.880 --> 23:27.640
in rubble now if it weren't for me?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.720
BELL CHIMES

23:29.720 --> 23:31.880
I'll explain on the way to supper.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.240
So what happened?
Right, where shall we start?

23:36.240 --> 23:39.520
He wanted to demolish the school,
until Gwen saved the day.
