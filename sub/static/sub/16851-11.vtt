00:01.435 --> 00:03.604
(male narrator)
 Previously on Childrens
 Hospital..

00:03.637 --> 00:05.206
- Blake.
- Blake?

00:05.239 --> 00:07.241
No, no,
I'm not Blake.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.777
I'm his brother,
Sir Tinkle Button.

00:09.810 --> 00:13.614
You're a sellout. You're a
Ronald McDonald...paint job.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.349
Hey.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.784
I don't like the P word.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.286
[theme music]

00:21.755 --> 00:25.526
- Is this your card?
- No.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.362
I know.
I know it's not.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.399
Can I have your attention,
please? I've got great news.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.468
All of you're gonna make twice
the money you did last week.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.137
(all)
Yeah.

00:36.170 --> 00:40.441
Because, you all get
to work the night shift.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.276
What?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.411
[everyone grumbling]

00:43.444 --> 00:45.246
You have to work the night shift

00:45.279 --> 00:47.481
because we had to fire
the night shift staff.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.251
We caught them betting
on a patient death pool.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.287
(Maestro)
'Wish you'd die in a pool.'

00:53.321 --> 00:55.523
[Eastern European accent]
This is a thing you needs

00:55.556 --> 00:57.791
prepare for
if you're going to work..

00:57.825 --> 00:59.327
...night shift.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.162
Oh, this is perfect timing.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.431
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Veelam Geza.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.366
He is the night shift
supervisor.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.101
He's gonna show you the ropes.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.437
It is my pleasures
to look at your faces

01:09.470 --> 01:12.273
and make your hands shake.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.508
Wof, my oof.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.111
What before my wondering eyes
do appear?

01:17.145 --> 01:18.746
Are you a little brown like me?

01:18.779 --> 01:21.415
Um, my mother's father
is a quarter Armenian

01:21.449 --> 01:23.184
so he's a little brown.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.454
Well, then I would gamble a farm
at your swarthy grandpapa

01:26.487 --> 01:29.323
had beautiful eyes
and full breasts, too.

01:29.357 --> 01:32.226
- Yes.
- Well, then come with me.

01:32.260 --> 01:37.798
And let me introduce you all
to the night..

01:37.831 --> 01:39.367
...shift.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.872
- 'Nurse, more I-V stat.'
- More I-V coming up.

01:44.905 --> 01:48.176
But where do you want me
to stick the IV, doctor?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.178
We don't schedule operations
at night.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.445
What is this?

01:51.479 --> 01:53.147
What's wrong with me,
Dr. Filth?

01:53.181 --> 01:54.315
Dr. Filth?

01:54.348 --> 01:58.419
You have HBS, Hot Boobs
Syndrome.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.589
I'm gonna need to take your
temperature with my man-ometer.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.792
Look how many C-Cs
that man-ometer is.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.695
(female #1)
'Where are you gonna stick
that thing? Here?'

02:07.728 --> 02:11.399
'Here?
Or in between these?'

02:11.432 --> 02:14.635
You see, this is a rectal
man-ometer, so.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.571
[moaning]

02:20.941 --> 02:24.178
- Are you nuts? Hold it!
- Whoa. Cut, Cut.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.779
What is your problem, man?

02:25.813 --> 02:29.250
I said you could use the supply
closet and the morgue.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.884
I didn't say anything
about the O-R.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.721
Yeah, and I told you,
we shoot where we want.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.223
Or you don't get paid.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.457
Make sure my stupid brother

02:36.490 --> 02:37.891
doesn't find out about this.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.694
Your brother is Blake, right?

02:40.728 --> 02:41.929
Yeah.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.267
I just sense something.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.637
A presence I haven't smelled
in a long, long time.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.641
What you are seeing with your
eyes balls is humanities dregs.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.477
Sir, you can't shoot
your son with a crossbow.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.312
Tell him
to stop eating my candy.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.914
It reminds me of the war
in my home country.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.650
You ever see
anyone get killed?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.686
Only the whole entirety
of my family's people.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.522
I was in the hospital,
saving lives for babies

03:08.556 --> 03:10.324
when I heard the shots.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.460
The rebels had come
down from the hills.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.529
By the time I had run
with my foots and toes home

03:15.563 --> 03:18.299
the rebels had killed
with guns and swords

03:18.332 --> 03:22.236
my children and parents,
and even my wife.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.240
So what did you do?

03:26.274 --> 03:29.310
Using my bare hands
covered only in skin

03:29.343 --> 03:32.813
I dug holes and put my family's
body insides of them.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.282
Oh, my God.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.585
I pour premium unleaded
gasoline on top

03:37.618 --> 03:40.321
and let the flames lick my face
like puppies dog.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.356
This just got super dark.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.593
For ten days, I went
into state of blackout rage

03:45.626 --> 03:49.663
and became killing machine
like Rambo or Rambo 2.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.666
I...am...wet.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.768
Now I will show you
the night nursery.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.338
Because I love-a the babies.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.350
Hold on a second.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.285
Hey, there,
crying lady.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.754
You're super sexy
and full of self-loathing.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.055
A killer combo.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.690
How about I make you
a thousandaire?

04:21.394 --> 04:24.398
Ooh...
Ha ha ha.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.936
I knew it.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.806
I thought I smelled chardonnay,
sweat, and menthol cigarettes.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.609
What's that smell? I think it's
arrogance mixed with sarcasm.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.311
If only I could bottle it.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.046
Then, by your logic
it smells sweet.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.782
Why would I make it
if no one wants it?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.517
- Yeah.
- Fine.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.486
You've bested me
at word play.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.721
But there's one thing
you can't beat me at

04:47.755 --> 04:51.459
making money off of things
that you don't approve of.

04:51.492 --> 04:55.396
I'm shooting a porno
in your hospital.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.331
What are you up to,
Tinkle Button?

04:57.365 --> 04:59.933
I just told you. I'm shooting
a porno in the hospital.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.835
[sniggers]

05:03.637 --> 05:04.905
I'll figure it out.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.710
It's only 11:30?
I'm so ti-ti.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.513
I am not. I'm always
on Eastern European time.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.716
Whoo!
I am full moon horny tonight.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.017
Hey.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.119
- Is this your card?
- No.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.521
No, it's not.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.122
- Hey.
- What?

05:22.155 --> 05:25.593
I know just what we need to make
it through the night shift.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.060
[dramatic music]

05:31.465 --> 05:34.067
Alright, you screw-heads.
That's a wrap.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.137
[gasps]
Et tu, Brute?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.139
That means "And you?"

05:39.172 --> 05:41.709
Blake, I'm just raising money
for the hospital.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.611
Out.
I'm ashamed of you.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.446
Get out of here.
All of you.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.548
- Just take five.
- Doctors wear shirts.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.750
And you.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.719
Joanna.
Hey, it's Blake.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.087
Yeah, my nana volunteers
with your grandma

05:54.121 --> 05:55.889
at the library on Saturdays.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.625
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.893
So what are you doing
at a porn shoot?

05:59.927 --> 06:03.464
Oh, um...I forget.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.434
- A D-P.
- A D-P, huh?

06:06.467 --> 06:07.835
That sounds crazy.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.071
Do you need a swimsuit
for a D-P?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.973
- 'It's double' [beep]
- What?

06:19.212 --> 06:22.750
Hi. I'm sorry our movie
made you cry.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.488
It's okay.
Come here.

06:27.521 --> 06:32.125
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh, Let the poison out.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.194
The kid in room four
is crashing.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.930
Dr. Spratt, nurse,
grab the kid and meet me there.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.866
I'm on it.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.067
Nurse, hurry up!

06:41.535 --> 06:43.971
Diet pills?
I knew you were fat.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.506
These are speed,
you dumbass.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.441
Give me some of these.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.210
Hey, maybe I'll finally start
writing that novel tonight.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.046
I'm gonna punch a kid's appendix
right out of his body.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.116
- Let's roll. Aaah.
- Aaah.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.651
The sun is dead!

06:57.685 --> 06:59.920
Long live the night team!

06:59.953 --> 07:02.089
It's bad enough that you've
defiled this hospital

07:02.122 --> 07:03.891
but somehow, you've roped

07:03.924 --> 07:06.093
in my Nanas best friend's
granddaughter.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.529
I also happen to be
a famous porn star.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.197
You are such a clown.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.033
You better mean clown
in the sense that we're both

07:13.066 --> 07:14.935
clowns with the makeup
and so forth.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.070
No. I meant it
in the idiomatic sense.

07:17.104 --> 07:21.174
That you're a foolish,
a hapless, silly individual.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.611
You clown of a bitch.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.913
We're losing him,
Dr. Spratt.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.715
- Nurse, give this child CPR.
- What?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.116
- Hurry up.
- But I'm not--

07:29.149 --> 07:31.785
Do it.
Hurry, nurse.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.021
Clear.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.023
You're alright.
Flawless technique, nurse.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.891
You could take a lesson,
Dr. Spratt.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.727
[moaning]

07:39.760 --> 07:43.063
Your face is like that
of my deads wife's face.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.534
That's weird.
And sexy.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.236
I want you
to get me mouth-pregnant.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.004
[unzips]

07:51.038 --> 07:53.541
Oh, yeah, cup the balls.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.709
- Whoo. Vroom.
- Ha ha ha.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.278
This is the most fun
I've ever had. Super fun.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.212
- Two more.
- Two more?

08:02.616 --> 08:05.786
- Hit me in the face.
- Do you feel your hair?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.221
- * Everybody want, mm hm
- Super fun. Super confident.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.990
Super fu..

08:10.023 --> 08:11.692
[eerie music]

08:16.997 --> 08:18.932
Owen, wake up.
Owen.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.273
Aah, Aah.
Move.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.811
Oh, yeah.
Ah.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.784
- You're hitting yourself.
- No, I'm not hitting myself.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.053
You know I hate
little smacks.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.756
Oh, yeah.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.058
Owen's having a heart attack.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.862
- Come on. Let's move.
- Come on.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.999
There's your nipple.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.202
We're coming, Owen.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.104
Oh, God.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.207
No, no, not today.
Not today.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.876
Hold these.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.011
- Clear.
- Don't touch him.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.781
Oh, Oh.
The shock killed her.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.022
- He's dead.
- What?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.824
- Oh, my God.
- No.

09:19.326 --> 09:23.997
Oh, my God.
Owen's de-a-a-ad.

* Come alive with you

09:42.082 --> 09:44.151
* It's a spot light

09:44.184 --> 09:48.088
* It's the magic
in the first bite *

09:48.121 --> 09:52.259
* If you only knew

09:52.292 --> 09:58.632
* The way you swoop

09:58.666 --> 10:05.005
* Into every little move

10:05.038 --> 10:10.110
* Come alive with you

10:11.078 --> 10:12.780
* Come a..

That's me.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.056
Ha ha!
Smoke!

10:23.924 --> 10:25.726
But, Owen, how?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.160
We're, We're carrying
your dead body.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.229
Are you?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.398
[gasping]

10:31.431 --> 10:34.301
- Is that your card?
- Yeah.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.169
[cheering and laughing]

10:38.471 --> 10:41.675
Oh, my God.
You're back.

* Come alive with you
come alive with you *

10:52.452 --> 10:55.388
- So, you got a baby in there?
- Supposedly.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.825
If you ever want
to make some extra cash

10:57.858 --> 10:59.359
there's a lot in preggo porn.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.062
Give me ten grand
and I'll jerk off a horse.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.363
Alright.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.232
Alright.

'Attention, hospital staff.'

they were coming'
