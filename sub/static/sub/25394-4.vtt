Supreme Court.

00:07.355 --> 00:10.053
My removal from office

00:10.097 --> 00:11.489
I have a plan to evict

00:11.533 --> 00:13.013
If we lose the

09:56.073 --> 09:58.685
What did the clerk's family say?

09:58.728 --> 10:01.905
Ready for some show
I brought you a present.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.474
I'll assume you don't have time
for practical jokes. What is it?

10:06.910 --> 10:08.520
Nanny cam.

10:08.564 --> 10:13.221
Justice Cheng's clerk, Jessie,
didn't trust anyone, it seems,

10:13.264 --> 10:14.831
especially the nanny.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.355
JESSIE: I'll do what you want.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.619
Please don't hurt them.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.272
According to the
husband, this man--

10:21.316 --> 10:23.710
let's call him Redbeard--
broke in,

10:23.753 --> 10:25.276
held them at gunpoint,

10:25.320 --> 10:27.017
sent Jessie off to work
with a suicide vest

10:27.061 --> 10:28.671
and a promise that if she didn't
do what he said...

10:28.715 --> 10:30.717
Her family was as good as dead.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.675
Take it to the NSA.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
See if we can get
facial rec on it.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.899
[protesters shouting
indistinctly]

10:42.598 --> 10:44.382
OFFICER :
Clear the road.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.167
This area's restricted.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.256
MAN: There she goes.
You ruined our lives!

10:48.299 --> 10:50.693
You ruined America!
You ruined...

10:50.737 --> 10:52.739
Let's go! Move it!

10:52.782 --> 10:54.392
MAN 2: Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll clear them out right away.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.090
Easy.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.657
They're more scared than we are.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.180
Are you sure about that?

11:00.747 --> 11:03.401
We have an abandoned
supercollider

11:03.445 --> 11:04.707
we're turning into a rail gun.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.578
Let's just say
we're not using the product

11:06.622 --> 11:08.406
for the manufacturer's
intended purpose.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.365
We don't want any surprises.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.714
Well, you'll get a bad surprise

11:11.758 --> 11:12.933
when you try to fire
one of those slugs

11:12.976 --> 11:15.587
at 30 kilometers per second

11:15.631 --> 11:17.633
with water pooled
in concrete.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.591
I walked the tunnel
this morning.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.419
There's rainwater in there,
ankle-deep.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.335
That needs to be pumped
to shore up its integrity.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.777
Well, your credentials
are impeccable, Ms. Lane.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.605
Secretary Edwards lobbied
for you passionately,

11:33.649 --> 11:35.433
which is rare for him.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.870
You must have made
quite the impression on him

11:36.913 --> 11:38.523
in the Ark.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.657
The worst of times
bring out the best in us.

11:43.659 --> 11:47.445
That bunker was difficult,
but we made due.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.795
Some of you better than others.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.274
A man died in there.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.841
His name was Joe.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.756
Yes.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.105
It was.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.672
What happened in there--

11:56.716 --> 11:58.456
a system failure,
compromised oxygen--

11:58.500 --> 11:59.806
it shouldn't have happened.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.069
Even foolproof systems
break down.

12:02.112 --> 12:06.160
This one was designed to safely
carry civilization across space,

12:06.203 --> 12:07.770
but it couldn't stand up
to a man

12:07.814 --> 12:09.772
with a wrench
and bad intentions.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.600
I'm sorry, are you suggesting

12:11.643 --> 12:13.123
that Joe tampered
with the bunker

12:13.167 --> 12:14.864
and almost killed us all?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.910
Someone did.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.740
I'm starting
with the obvious suspects,

12:20.783 --> 12:23.090
making my way down the list.

12:23.133 --> 12:26.310
I thought
this was a job interview.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.095
It was. You're hired.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.967
Yes. What?

12:31.011 --> 12:32.360
Yes, of course.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.970
Send him up
to my office immediately.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.755
Ms. Lane--

12:35.798 --> 12:36.799
Fiona--

12:36.843 --> 12:38.758
Dr. Stendahl will be in touch.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.586
JILLIAN:
Office of the Vice President,

12:41.630 --> 12:43.197
please hold.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.155
Office of the
Vice President.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.810
He's in a meeting at the moment.
Can I take a message?

12:47.854 --> 12:50.160
Geez, what's a guy

12:50.204 --> 12:52.423
got to do to get a beer
around here?

12:52.467 --> 12:53.685
Liam?

12:53.729 --> 12:54.861
H-He'll call you right back.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.353
I'm sorry.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.833
I thought this was
the vice president's office,

13:10.877 --> 13:13.053
not the bleachers at
a high school football stadium.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.533
Darius, you sarcastic prick.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.101
That's Vice President Prick
to you.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.458
Welcome back.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.038
NURSE :
All available transport teams
to Triage, stat.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.519
Justice Cheng sustained
massive blunt force trauma,

13:44.562 --> 13:45.912
extensive internal bleeding,

13:45.955 --> 13:47.348
and swelling on the brain.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.698
I understand he's been
in and out of consciousness.

13:49.741 --> 13:50.960
What's the prognosis?

13:51.004 --> 13:52.875
It's a waiting game.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.572
We put him
in a medically induced coma

13:54.616 --> 13:55.747
this morning
to stop the swelling.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.793
His wife is sitting vigil.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.795
Roland Cavanaugh,
White House counsel.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.057
If you put him

14:01.101 --> 14:02.929
in the coma, I'm assuming

14:02.972 --> 14:05.670
you could also
take him out of the coma

14:05.714 --> 14:07.934
by order of the president
of the United States?

14:07.977 --> 14:11.589
Right now we're just trying
to keep Justice Cheng alive.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.896
Whether he stays in a coma
or not is up to his wife,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.419
not the president.Understood.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.379
But we would like to speak
to Mrs. Cheng personally,

14:18.422 --> 14:19.859
if you don't mind.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
I'll let her know.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.039
Thank you.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.736
It's a good thing
you're not a doctor,

14:27.779 --> 14:29.390
'cause your
bedside manner stinks.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.783
Please, let me handle this.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.482
Ms. Barrows, I've been a
litigator for 20 years.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.919
I have won 79% of my cases.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.921
Why? Because I'm a fighter.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.880
Hmm. Your job is to fight.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.055
My job is to make nice.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.491
Who do you think
is better equipped

14:43.534 --> 14:45.406
to talk to a woman
with a dying husband?

14:45.449 --> 14:48.452
You remind me
of my second ex-wife.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.240
Oh, my God.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.458
Hello.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.764
ALONZO:
Ms. Barrows.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.332
Detective Alonzo Carter here.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.769
Um, just a moment of your time.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.510
My sister's body turned up.

15:02.553 --> 15:03.946
Yes, I saw that on the news.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.339
Yeah, the White House

15:05.382 --> 15:07.428
is blocking me
from her autopsy report.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.995
I could use a little help.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.953
Detective, I'm sorry. I am.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.955
But I-I can't help you
right now.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.130
NURSE: Dr. Walter Yu
to fourth floor NICU.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.436
Wh

15:15.479 --> 15:19.788
Dr. Walter Yu
to fourth floor NICU, please.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.181
Ms. Barrows?

15:31.017 --> 15:34.890
Dr. Walter Yu, where are you?

15:42.028 --> 15:46.032
A rail gun. So that's the
direction you're going in.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.685
It'll work, as soon as we get

15:47.729 --> 15:49.209
the Army Corps of Engineers
back on the job.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.429
We just need
Justice Cheng

15:52.473 --> 15:54.257
to render a decision.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.912
Stop all the
madness out there.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.917
So, you want to tell
me what happened?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.485
"What happened"?

16:04.528 --> 16:07.923
Uh, RE/SYST broke us into groups

16:07.967 --> 16:10.099
and we settled
on my solar sail project.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.014
And we were making
a go of it,

16:12.058 --> 16:13.015
pretty successfully, actually.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.364
Why didn't you kill Tess?

16:16.323 --> 16:18.107
Disarm those nukes?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.719
I didn't get the chance.

16:21.763 --> 16:24.070
There were guards everywhere.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.333
Huh.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.339
I thought you'd gone
Stockholm syndrome on me.

16:32.382 --> 16:35.298
Started to identify
with your captors.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.911
You said Croft was there.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.001
Not surprising,
the Russians served him up.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.698
Who else

16:43.741 --> 16:48.050
Uh, yeah. Dr. Chandra.
Dr. Kandhari.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.357
Raul Aguirre was a no-show.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.272
Well, nothing surprising there.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.056
There was one
surprising name.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.928
Uh, well, it-it
might be for you.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
Alycia Vrettou.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.024
Alycia Vrettou.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.896
What rock did that insect
crawl out from under?

17:07.939 --> 17:10.203
RE/SYST.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.596
She's one of them, Darius.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.990
Of course she is.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.647
I knew this had the air
of something very personal.

17:19.690 --> 17:23.085
First Tess, then Tanz.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.698
That woman is dangerous,
more than you know.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.658
Her methods are
questionable, but...

17:30.701 --> 17:34.923
she seems to want to solve
the asteroid problem

17:34.966 --> 17:37.099
just like us.

17:37.143 --> 17:42.061
Whoever, however she seems,

17:42.104 --> 17:44.498
Alycia Vrettou
is nothing like us.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.934
She's a shadow.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.892
Y-You'll never
fully grasp her,

17:47.936 --> 17:52.071
never fully see her
until it's too late.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.595
Come on. Let's get
you up to speed.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.688
GRACE:
Mrs. Cheng.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.169
Grace Barrows, Senior Advisor
to President Mackenzie.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.605
We spoke earlier.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.128
I'm here on behalf
of the president

18:06.172 --> 18:07.999
to express her support
for your husband.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.567
We appreciate that,
Ms. Barrows.

18:10.611 --> 18:14.136
Mrs. Cheng,
your husband had perhaps

18:14.180 --> 18:15.964
the most important decision

18:16.007 --> 18:17.792
in the history of our country
ahead of him.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.577
I know Martin's
vote is critical,

18:20.621 --> 18:22.231
and the Court's four-four.

18:22.275 --> 18:27.758
I would love to see Bennett
get what he deserves.

18:27.802 --> 18:31.153
We have known Pauline Mackenzie
for ten years.

18:31.197 --> 18:35.114
She appointed my
husband to the Court.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.768
There is no way that
she is behind any of this.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.640
Mrs. Cheng...

18:39.683 --> 18:41.163
Rhonda, please.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.165
Rhonda, there's a way for us
to resolve all of this

18:43.209 --> 18:45.776
and get the country back
on track.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.214
How?

18:48.257 --> 18:52.174
If Dr. Vale brought
your husband out of that coma

18:52.218 --> 18:54.263
just long enough for him
to make his decision public,

18:54.307 --> 18:56.091
we could put all of this
behind us.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.582
You're asking me to risk
my husband's life?

19:08.625 --> 19:11.367
He's the only one who can
restore law and order,

19:11.411 --> 19:12.977
which is crucial...

19:13.021 --> 19:14.501
You know, I thought
Bennett was the monster.

19:16.242 --> 19:20.333
If you come anywhere near my
husband, I'll have you arrested.

19:24.511 --> 19:28.079
Sounds like you really
nailed it, Ms. Barrows.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.870
A magnetic field is
generated around the rails

19:35.913 --> 19:38.612
as current flows
through the circuit.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.527
It interacts
with the armature current,

19:40.570 --> 19:42.529
generating a
Lorentz force.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.661
Which accelerates the armature
and projectile down barrel.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.621
How many hits will it take
to nudge Samson off course?

19:47.664 --> 19:49.536
Figure somewhere around
a thousand separate slugs.

19:49.579 --> 19:53.496
So it is basically fire
big-ass gun at rock.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.413
Exactly. We'll be testing it on
a smaller asteroid, 2013 AU 17,

19:57.457 --> 19:58.719
passing in four weeks.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.373
Four weeks?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.549
You'll be lucky to get this done
in four months.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.508
Darius, my idea to
attach a solar sail

20:05.552 --> 20:07.728
to the gravity tractor,
it works now.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.557
This is the plan.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.994
How do you plan
to finish the plan?

20:13.037 --> 20:14.648
I mean, without a workforce.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.911
What if Cheng's decision
doesn't materialize?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.739
We're filling in the ranks
slowly but surely.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.654
Slowly being the
operative word.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.874
Why don't you crowdsource
the idea?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.442
"Public work project
needs all hands on deck."

20:26.486 --> 20:28.836
Recruit the general public?Yes.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.620
Engineers, manual laborers.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.536
Everyone's just sitting
at home, helpless.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.755
They want to do their part,

20:34.798 --> 20:36.235
why don't you bring it
directly to them?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.498
Hashtag for work.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.544
Work to save the world.
Who wouldn't want that?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.633
You're counting on people
getting off their asses,

20:43.677 --> 20:46.070
throwing themselves
into harm's way?

20:46.114 --> 20:47.985
Offer them money.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.771
I'm not sure how much that
motivates people at the moment.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.991
Since when did you become
the Island of Dr. No?

20:59.780 --> 21:02.435
You're right. I'll post
something on my account,

21:02.478 --> 21:03.697
see what comes back.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
Liam.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.527
Guess that's my cue.

21:09.616 --> 21:12.619
FIONA: He kept asking me
about the Ark.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.098
The guy that died, Joe.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.622
Like he was accusing me
of something.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.363
It was uncomfortable.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.887
I'm sorry, Darius makes
everyone uncomfortable.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.105
Yeah, apparently.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.107
And then he was fishing
around about us.

21:23.151 --> 21:26.328
So, what exactly
did you tell him?

21:26.372 --> 21:28.678
Other than your
qualifications... nothing.

21:28.722 --> 21:32.682
Well, he knows, somehow.
Or insinuated as much.

21:32.726 --> 21:36.991
I don't like secrets, Harris.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.689
Hey, hey, hey.

21:39.733 --> 21:40.951
Neither do I.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.563
Good. 'Cause I'm all
about full disclosure.

21:43.606 --> 21:46.130
So you need to tell him
that we're involved,

21:46.174 --> 21:47.697
unless we're not,

21:47.741 --> 21:50.178
in which case,
you need to tell me.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.618
Yeah, come in.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.926
Mr. Secretary,
something you should see.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.145
I was just leaving.

22:05.280 --> 22:09.545
Redbeard. I know who he is,
just not where he is.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.116
SECURITY GUARD:
Sorry, hospital's full.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.596
Medical personnel only.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.815
DC Metro,
working a case.

22:18.859 --> 22:22.689
Hey, watch yourself, man.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.299
Go ahead, sir.
All right.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.042
Guy didn't exist.
Wasn't in the NSA database.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.870
So I had them
check social media,

22:29.913 --> 22:33.047
where everybody exists
in some form, and we found this.

22:33.090 --> 22:37.791
From Fallujah.
Name is Vick, Robert J., USMC.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.447
Deceased. Looks pretty good for
a dead man, don't you think?

22:41.490 --> 22:42.883
What's his story?

22:42.926 --> 22:45.494
He served under one general
most of his career.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.931
HARRIS:
Wallace?

22:52.893 --> 22:55.156
I need to know General Wallace's
location immediately.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.378
He's in the Oval Office,
with the president.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.076
Get me Secret Service, now!

23:02.119 --> 23:03.991
Well, what now,
Ms. Barrows?

23:04.034 --> 23:07.168
You have so elegantly
paved the road with turds.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.865
You've left me
no room to maneuver.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.998
She's in shock.
Just give her a little time.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.261
Time, one thing
we don't have.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.921
Excuse me a second.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.575
Are you stalking me?

23:22.618 --> 23:24.794
This floor is secure,
you shouldn't even be here.

23:24.838 --> 23:25.839
But I am.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.841
So you might as well talk to me.

23:27.884 --> 23:30.060
I need your help getting
a copy of that autopsy.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.541
The White House is holding on
to that information tight.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.151
A little too tight,
if you ask me.

23:34.195 --> 23:36.676
Detective, Alonzo,
we are on the brink here.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.765
I'm on the brink, Ms. Barrows.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.854
My sister's body is in a morgue.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.812
Someone killed her.
That matters still.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.988
Justice still matters to me.
Why doesn't it matter to you?

23:45.032 --> 23:47.643
It does, more than you know.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.647
Detective, I can't help you
right now. I'm sorry.

23:51.691 --> 23:52.779
You need to leave,

23:52.822 --> 23:55.608
or I'll ask the marshals
to see you out.

23:58.524 --> 24:02.179
I didn't mean to challenge you
in there with Dr. Stendahl.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.921
Of course you did.
That's what you do.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.359
Maybe I'm imagining things,

24:08.403 --> 24:09.926
but ever since
I brought up Alycia's name,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.493
you've been acting like
I'm the enemy.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.147
Well, are you?

24:13.190 --> 24:16.280
No, w Just because
I didn't slam her and say

24:16.324 --> 24:18.108
she was the most evil person
I've ever met,

24:18.152 --> 24:20.328
I'm not trustworthy now?

24:22.939 --> 24:24.767
She got to you.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.772
Even though she's
part of RE/SYST

24:29.816 --> 24:34.429
and manipulated you,
you defend her like...

24:34.473 --> 24:35.691
some sort of lover.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.214
What the hell does that mean?

24:37.258 --> 24:38.346
You tell me.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.741
For the record, she didn't have
many good things

24:41.784 --> 24:42.916
to say about you.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.352
I'm shocked.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.876
Look, Darius, m-maybe
in another world,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.618
collaborating with Alycia
Vrettou would be...

24:49.662 --> 24:51.968
Collaborate?!
With the enemy?

24:52.012 --> 24:54.231
No, the real enemy here
is time, Darius.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.450
You have a plan
that is stalling,

24:55.494 --> 24:58.845
whereas we have
a plan that is...
We?

24:58.888 --> 25:01.717
Bring up Alycia Vrettou
one more time. I dare you.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.024
Bring her up one more time!

25:04.067 --> 25:07.810
You do, you won't be
welcome here anymore.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.552
MAN: Mr. Vice President, there's
a situation in the Oval Office.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.814
They need you right away, sir.

25:14.469 --> 25:15.949
Not to be continued.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.562
Hey. What was all that?

25:20.606 --> 25:21.694
Oh, it's just Darius Tanz.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.523
God amongst men.
So full of himself

25:24.566 --> 25:26.829
it's a wonder there's air
left for the rest of us!

25:26.873 --> 25:28.265
RHONDA:
What don't you understand?

25:28.309 --> 25:29.832
I said no!But it's your duty, ma'am.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.442
Your husband would
want it that way.

25:31.486 --> 25:35.011
Mrs. Cheng, I'm so sorry
for the intrusion.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.884
Intrusion?

25:37.927 --> 25:41.235
You're talking about
my husband's life.

25:41.278 --> 25:44.934
Do you have any idea what
you people are asking me to do?

25:48.024 --> 25:50.679
The unthinkable.

25:50.723 --> 25:54.248
To possibly kill...

25:54.291 --> 25:55.597
the man I love,

25:55.641 --> 25:58.382
the man that I
spent my life with.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.040
You're right.

26:05.999 --> 26:09.655
You're right,
it's unthinkable.

26:09.698 --> 26:14.573
Everything that's happened,
happening, is unthinkable.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.577
In the past few months,
I've found myself

26:18.620 --> 26:22.450
doing the unthinkable
again and again.

26:22.493 --> 26:28.238
And I ask myself at what cost?
And was it worth it?

26:28.282 --> 26:32.852
And the truth is, I don't know.

26:32.895 --> 26:36.856
I've tried to do what I thought
was right, but these days,

26:36.899 --> 26:42.035
the difference between right
and wrong is awfully blurry.

26:45.081 --> 26:48.998
All we have is our moral
compass to guide us.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.697
It's-it's all we have.

27:02.055 --> 27:05.058
I want to do the right thing.

27:07.103 --> 27:11.020
Please... help me.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.383
Clearly there's been
some new developments.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.689
Yes.

27:27.733 --> 27:28.951
Seems that
General Wallace here

27:28.995 --> 27:30.605
has been leaking info
to Monroe Bennett.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.695
He's the reason Bennett's
been one step ahead,

27:33.739 --> 27:35.131
knows everything we know.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.698
You give me too much credit.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.004
AIDE: Madam President,

27:38.047 --> 27:40.659
Bennett knows where
Justice Cheng is.

27:40.702 --> 27:43.052
He just put the call out
on Twitter.What call?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.620
He's crowdsourcing.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.056
"All like-minded patriots

27:47.100 --> 27:49.842
"report to D.C.
General Hospital ASAP.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.453
"Mack admin trying to steal
court ruling.

27:52.496 --> 27:58.154
Don't let them subvert justice.
#HospitalBlockade #TakeHerDown."

28:00.374 --> 28:01.854
Grace.

28:25.094 --> 28:29.011
Mrs. Cheng,
any moment now.

28:40.588 --> 28:44.113
How long... was I asleep?

28:44.157 --> 28:46.725
Since yesterday.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.553
Do you remember what
happened to you, Marty?

28:54.645 --> 28:56.212
Ms. Barrows.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.477
Chief Justice Cheng.

29:00.521 --> 29:03.350
Mr. Cavanaugh and I have come
from the White House

29:03.393 --> 29:05.787
to get your decision
memorialized

29:05.831 --> 29:08.224
in the case of
Bennett v. Mackenzie.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.883
Your pen...

29:14.927 --> 29:17.668
Sir, I'm sorry,
there's no time for that.

29:17.712 --> 29:21.237
We need to record this right
now, if that's okay with you.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.512
Please state your name
for the record, sir.

29:35.556 --> 29:38.254
Martin Cheng.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.694
Chief Justice
of the United States

29:43.738 --> 29:46.001
Supreme Court.

29:49.570 --> 29:52.051
I'm so sorry.
Please excuse me.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.445
GRACE:
Hello?

29:55.489 --> 29:56.838
DARIUS:
Grace.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.187
Bennett's put out
a call to arms.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.320
His civilian militia's
gonna ambush the hospital.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.191
You need to get out of there.GRACE: What

30:02.235 --> 30:03.453
Now!

30:11.026 --> 30:15.161
Clear this area now!

30:15.204 --> 30:17.598
Move back!

30:17.641 --> 30:18.904
Darius, Justice Cheng
has just woken up.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.993
I'm not leaving here
without his decision.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.342
Cheng's just woken up.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.343
This can't all be for nothing.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.518
I'm sorry.No, Grace, Grace.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.041
Grace!

30:28.087 --> 30:29.871
I'm sorry for the interruption.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.742
She's refusing to leave
till she gets the decision.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.135
Great.

30:34.745 --> 30:37.009
Grace, damn it.

30:37.052 --> 30:40.621
Justice Cheng, are you
of sound mind and body?

30:42.928 --> 30:44.320
CHENG:
Yes.

30:44.364 --> 30:48.107
And are you under any duress
to render this opinion?

30:48.150 --> 30:51.153
No.

30:51.197 --> 30:52.938
And what is your decision, sir,

30:52.981 --> 30:55.288
in the matter of
Bennett v. Mackenzie?

30:58.944 --> 31:00.119
What the hell was that?

31:00.162 --> 31:03.122
This hospital's
about to be under siege.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.906
Dr. Vale, we need
to move Justice Cheng

31:04.950 --> 31:06.212
to a secure location.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.430
That's not possible.
His condition isn't stable.

31:07.474 --> 31:10.433
Okay. Then we need
to secure this area.

31:10.477 --> 31:13.001
Barricade ourselves inside.W

31:13.045 --> 31:16.004
Jam that door shut.ROLAND: Barricade ourselves?
That's insane.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.659
We need to leave now.
Staying is suicide.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.966
Strength in numbers, Roland.
Make a decision, but do it fast.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.142
Good luck.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.058
Okay.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.063
Are you able
to continue, sir?

31:32.194 --> 31:33.979
What is your decision
in the matter

31:34.022 --> 31:36.503
of Bennett v. Mackenzie?

31:36.546 --> 31:38.984
He practically accused me
of being a traitor.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.594
Look, Liam,

31:40.637 --> 31:42.944
Darius has been under
an enormous amount of stress,

31:42.988 --> 31:44.598
and so have you.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.862
It's not like
I was tortured or anything.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.820
I was given
every resource imaginable

31:49.864 --> 31:51.039
to solve the problem.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.823
And we made progress,

31:52.867 --> 31:54.086
fast, on my idea.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.957
Now I'm being dropped
into a plan

31:56.001 --> 31:57.306
that's contingent
on finding labor,

31:57.350 --> 31:59.091
which is in such
short supply, I...

32:03.225 --> 32:05.619
Office of the Vice President.

32:05.662 --> 32:09.144
Uh, Dr. Stendahl, hi.
He's behind closed doors.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.842
What?

32:11.886 --> 32:15.020
Yes, I will let him
know right away.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.413
Several hundred people
just showed up to help

32:17.457 --> 32:18.980
with the rail gun project,

32:19.024 --> 32:20.982
and not just people
with hammers

32:21.026 --> 32:23.985
and shovels--
actual engineers, too.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.380
Darius's tweet worked.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.121
Darius's tweet. My idea.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.340
Who cares? It's good news.

32:31.384 --> 32:34.169
Go, tell Darius.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.344
Progress.

32:37.042 --> 32:41.307
♪ The end is coming soon

32:41.350 --> 32:43.004
♪ So grab yourself the reins

32:43.048 --> 32:44.875

32:44.919 --> 32:46.399
Mr. Cole.

32:46.442 --> 32:50.751
Madam President. Darius.
What's going on?

32:50.794 --> 32:53.449
Justice Cheng's whereabouts have
been outed on social media.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.190
Bennett's launching
a siege.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.975
Just hold them
as long as you can.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.368
Just got off with DC Metro,
the crowds are swarming.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.196
They can't hold
the hospital.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.850

33:02.893 --> 33:04.895
So Ms. Barrows and Mr. Cavanaugh
are out there alone?

33:04.939 --> 33:07.637
Harris, now's the time
to send out the National Guard.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.248
HARRIS: We have, but
Bennett's sending civilians

33:09.291 --> 33:12.033
with guns in every direction
to block us from getting there.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.339
He's using Twitter to mobilize.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.428
Bennett's most powerful weapon
is the Internet.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.212
It's how he sends his orders.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.563
We need to stop the flow
of information.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.217
How?The Internet.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.089
Kill it.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.091
Kill it?

Mr. Secretary,
where is this kill switch?

33:43.151 --> 33:44.500
The Pentagon.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.589
It was installed post-9/11
as a security measure.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.069
It'll turn off
the nodes that route

33:48.113 --> 33:50.376
to the DNS servers, bring
Internet traffic to a stop,

33:50.419 --> 33:52.291
but it requires
specific protocol.

33:52.334 --> 33:53.379
It would neuter
Bennett's ability

33:53.422 --> 33:55.163
to communicate

33:55.207 --> 33:57.687

She can't send it

Okay. Detective.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.561
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.997
Gun!

35:43.402 --> 35:44.925
Clear!

35:50.017 --> 35:51.192
Damn, Ms. Barrows.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.368
My name's Grace.I know.

35:53.412 --> 35:56.502
Well, Grace, we got to
get out of here. Fast.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.642
You got in one fight
with Darius

36:06.686 --> 36:08.340
and you're going
back to RE/SYST.

36:08.383 --> 36:11.081
I'm not going back to RE/SYST,
I'm going back to 30 scientists

36:11.125 --> 36:13.823
who want to save the world.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.564
Come with me.
No.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.784
It's still RE/SYST, Liam.
They're monsters.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.829
No, they're brilliant thinkers
and they're innovators.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.136
The only monsters
are the fascists

36:22.180 --> 36:25.357
who've made a mess
of everything out here.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.054

36:27.097 --> 36:28.882
You have no idea
what Darius has done

36:28.925 --> 36:30.797
to keep this world
from falling apart.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.974
So that's your job now?
You're Darius Tanz's apologist.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.545
Liam.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.461
I don't know
who you are right now.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.854
Well, I finally do.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.814
And it's not Darius's lapdog.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.903
Look, I have a plan
to stop this asteroid,

36:49.946 --> 36:51.165
a plan that's gonna work.

36:52.949 --> 36:55.169
Are you coming
with me or not?

37:01.131 --> 37:04.004
You told me to hold onto this

37:04.047 --> 37:07.703
until we got married.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.621
I think you should take it back.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.894
Good-bye, Liam.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.288
And good luck.

HARRIS:
It's done.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.177
The Net is down.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.222
I can't get a signal.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.746
I have the most important
video file

38:33.789 --> 38:35.791
in U.S. history here
and no way to send it.

38:35.835 --> 38:39.404
Let's hope this works.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.971
For Grace's sake,
it better.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.756
Well, she's a fighter.
You know her.

38:43.799 --> 38:46.759
I do. Not as well
as you, but...

38:46.802 --> 38:48.978
I'm involved with someone else.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.415
For the record.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.026
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.593
I don't like secrets, Harris.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.856
I expect full transparency
from my Secretary of Defense.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.118
Are we clear?

39:00.425 --> 39:03.776
It's Grace. Grace?

39:03.819 --> 39:05.255
Darius?

39:05.299 --> 39:06.996
DARIUS: I'm putting you
on speaker. What's happening?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.302
Ms. Barrows, we're in bad need

39:08.346 --> 39:09.869
of some good news
right about now.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.958
I've got it,
I just can't send it.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.090
The decision?GRACE: It was five to four.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.005
For you, Madam President.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.707
HARRIS:
The timing, unbelievable.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.186
Grace, we had to shut down
the Internet

39:23.230 --> 39:24.492
to choke off Bennett's
communications.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.059
He's got the city under siege.

39:26.102 --> 39:29.105
They shut down the
Internet. What now?

39:29.149 --> 39:30.542
The hospital's
still surrounded, Darius.

39:30.585 --> 39:31.804
There's no way out.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.022
DARIUS:
Hang on.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.154
Bring up the civil
defense mainframe,

39:34.197 --> 39:36.069
show me the
hospital schematics.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.594
Grace,

39:39.638 --> 39:42.423
there's an employee only
elevator in the ICU.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.207
It has direct access
to the rooftop.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.732
We'll have a helicopter prepped
and ready to go in two minutes.

39:46.775 --> 39:49.343
There's a heliport. We're gonna
get you out of there.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.214
Okay. Got it.
They shut down the Internet.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.303
We have to hand deliver this
to the White House.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.435
And I'm guessing
public transportation

39:54.479 --> 39:56.045
is out at this point.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.047
We have to get to the roof.
They're sending a helicopter.

39:58.091 --> 40:01.224
We can't move Justice Cheng,
he's in no condition.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.705
I'm not leaving without
my husband, but you have to.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.925
You need to deliver
that video safely.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.189
I'll secure the door.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.191
You ever fired
a gun, Dr. Vale?

40:11.234 --> 40:12.540
Ex-Army.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.150
They're sending troops
to the hospital.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.588
I called for backup.
They're en route.

40:16.631 --> 40:19.112
Rhonda, thank you.
Your country thanks you.

40:19.155 --> 40:22.158
Stay safe, Grace.

40:32.473 --> 40:33.909
Liam.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.480
What happened?

40:39.524 --> 40:43.658
You were right.
I didn't like what I saw.

40:43.702 --> 40:45.660
Get some sleep.

40:45.704 --> 40:48.794
You've got some work
to catch up on.

40:48.837 --> 40:51.927
No time for sleep.
We've got a planet to save.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.906
There.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.995
I see it, Darius.

41:19.389 --> 41:22.305
Okay. It's landing.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.264
