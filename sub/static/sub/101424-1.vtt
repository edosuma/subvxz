Please. Please, just listen.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.460
Let me speak so--
so you'll understand.

02:11.543 --> 02:14.377
Because this morning, I wake up,
and I'm reading the Times

02:14.460 --> 02:16.877
because I love the Times
like it was my child

02:16.960 --> 02:18.460
or it was my-- my parent.

02:18.543 --> 02:21.043
I mean officer, do you know
what the New York Times  means

02:21.126 --> 02:23.126
to a liberal Jewish woman
like me?

02:23.210 --> 02:25.919
On the census,
when it asks for religion,

02:26.001 --> 02:28.835
I don't put Jewish,
I put the New York Times.

02:28.919 --> 02:32.293
So I pick up the Times,
which I have delivered,

02:32.377 --> 02:34.877
the real Times,
the newsprint Times.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.043
Yeah, yes,
I know I'm old-fashioned,

02:37.126 --> 02:39.585
but really, officer, please.

02:39.669 --> 02:42.877
Reading the Times  online
is like having sex with a robot.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.585
Yeah, I mean, it's cleaner
and it's faster,

02:44.669 --> 02:47.627
but you can tell the difference.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.710
Okay, I'll just say it.
The New York Times  online

02:50.794 --> 02:53.502
is the New York Times
for the gentiles.

02:53.585 --> 02:56.502
I mean, have you ever had dinner
with a Lutheran family?

02:56.585 --> 02:57.919
That's not food.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.919
By the way, officer,
are-- are you Jewish?

03:02.001 --> 03:05.794
Uh. Oh, you're Catholic.
(CHUCKLES) That's fine.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.001
And I'm the one being arrested.

03:08.085 --> 03:09.710
(LAUGHS) I'm kidding.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.502
(CHUCKLES)
So, I pick up the paper.

03:12.585 --> 03:15.043
See, there's a reason
it's called "the paper."

03:15.710 --> 03:16.919
Only there he is.

03:17.752 --> 03:19.251
His face above the fold.

03:20.794 --> 03:22.335
Him.

03:22.418 --> 03:23.919
You know who I'm talking about.

03:25.085 --> 03:26.877
I can't even stand
to say his name,

03:26.960 --> 03:30.251
because I'm a New Yorker,
and we always hated him.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.960
And it wasn't just the lying
and the hair

03:32.043 --> 03:34.043
and the ugly buildings.
Oh my God, no.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.418
He has no style.
He has no sense of humor!

03:36.502 --> 03:38.919
He tore down Bonwit Teller
in the middle of the night!

03:39.001 --> 03:40.293

03:49.293 --> 03:50.335
I didn't say that.

03:52.126 --> 03:54.794
(SIGHS) But yes, I did.

03:54.877 --> 03:58.168
And that's part of the problem.
I hate being like this.

03:58.251 --> 04:00.126
I mean, even years ago,
when I had no money

04:00.210 --> 04:02.377
and I was waitressing
and I was going to City College

04:02.460 --> 04:04.627
and-- and my parents
kept nagging me to get married

04:04.710 --> 04:06.168
and we had Nixon and Roy Cohn

04:06.251 --> 04:08.502
and whoever the fuck
invented patios!

04:08.585 --> 04:10.335
I mean, I never felt like this.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.794
I never went to bed in a rage
and woke up

04:12.877 --> 04:14.085
having a panic attack.

04:14.168 --> 04:16.752
I didn't spend every day
in anger and dread and--

04:16.835 --> 04:18.460
and I didn't hate
those other people.

04:18.543 --> 04:21.877
Those people from Nebraska
and Ohio and Alabama.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.585
I mean,
I fly over them, but I'd wave.

04:24.669 --> 04:26.627
And when they came
to New York City to visit,

04:26.710 --> 04:29.460
I-- I'd give 'em directions
to Lion King.

04:29.543 --> 04:32.168
I mean, I'd start to recommend
the new Sondheim.

04:32.251 --> 04:33.418
They'd say, "Who's Sondheim?"

04:33.502 --> 04:35.460
I'd say,
"Have fun with the puppets."

04:35.543 --> 04:38.919
I mean, maybe we weren't--
we weren't buddies, but--

04:39.001 --> 04:40.835
but we didn't despise
each other.

04:41.752 --> 04:42.960
That's what he did.

04:43.043 --> 04:44.710
(PANTS) Oh, God.

04:45.752 --> 04:46.835
I'm doing it.

04:48.168 --> 04:50.043
The fury, the agita,

04:50.126 --> 04:52.919
the constant need to shake
my copy of the New York Times

04:53.001 --> 04:55.835
and scream at it,
"How could you let this happen?"

04:55.919 --> 04:57.877
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

05:00.251 --> 05:01.418
Not the Arts section.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.752
You know, sometimes I worry
that maybe

05:04.835 --> 05:06.960
I'm a little too attached
to the Times,  like--

05:07.043 --> 05:10.251
like maybe it was my best friend
or something, or like--

05:10.335 --> 05:13.251
like when my late husband, Nick,
was still alive,

05:13.335 --> 05:16.919
and we used to spend all day
Sunday in bed with the Times.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.710
His cinnamon and raisin bagels
and lox,

05:18.794 --> 05:20.919
and you know
what we call that? (LAUGHS)

05:21.001 --> 05:23.001
We call it "a Jewish orgy."

05:23.085 --> 05:26.585
(LAUGHS)

05:26.669 --> 05:28.543
But there's his face,

05:28.627 --> 05:31.502
and it's such an insult
to the Times,

05:31.585 --> 05:34.251
and to Nick,
who hated him more than anybody.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.085
I can't talk about Nick, though.
I-- I...

05:38.752 --> 05:41.752
No. Not now. Maybe not ever.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.502
So, I take a shower and then
I turn on The Today Show

05:45.585 --> 05:48.752
because I love those co-hosts,
Savannah and Hoda.

05:48.835 --> 05:50.043
I just love them.
They're so smart.

05:50.126 --> 05:52.085
They're so upbeat.
It's like they're always saying,

05:52.168 --> 05:54.168
"Hey, there's been a plane crash
and a tsunami,

05:54.251 --> 05:55.669
but we're both wearing
sleeveless dresses,

05:55.752 --> 05:57.418
so mazel tov!" (LAUGHS)

05:58.085 --> 06:00.085
Only today... (CHUCKLES)

06:00.168 --> 06:02.335
...and I can tell
they're not enjoying it,

06:02.418 --> 06:04.168
they're doing a report

06:04.251 --> 06:07.126
on the daughter's
Goodwill World Tour.

06:09.085 --> 06:10.710
"The daughter."

06:10.794 --> 06:12.669
She's always laughing
and smiling.

06:12.752 --> 06:16.085
She wears more makeup
than the Rockettes combined.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.126
And I don't know what the fuck
she's doing in the White House.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.877
I mean, will you tell me?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.377
She wasn't elected.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.293
And before that,
she had Chinese sweatshops

06:25.377 --> 06:27.543
churning out that crappy jewelry
of her-- hers,

06:27.627 --> 06:31.001
while her dad jabbered on
about American jobs.

06:31.085 --> 06:33.293
And when 12 women
were brave enough

06:33.377 --> 06:36.377
to come forward and say
that he had assaulted them,

06:36.460 --> 06:38.293
she says, "I believe my father."

06:38.377 --> 06:41.585
And then when the tape comes out
where he talks

06:41.669 --> 06:43.502
about grabbing women...
(WHISPERING) ...by the pussy,

06:43.585 --> 06:45.919
she says,
"That's not the man I know."

06:46.001 --> 06:48.752
Well, let me introduce you,
sweetheart.

06:50.126 --> 06:52.001
(SIGHS)

06:52.085 --> 06:55.085
And I'm not gonna say a word
about her marriage

06:55.168 --> 06:56.835
because
that's her personal life,

06:56.919 --> 06:58.710
even if she chose
to marry a rich boy

06:58.794 --> 07:01.794
who looks like
Celine Dion's sad niece.

07:01.877 --> 07:04.752
You know, she went after him,
but he said no.

07:04.835 --> 07:07.585
No, not unless she converted.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.418
So she meets with a rabbi,
and overnight,

07:10.502 --> 07:13.377
alakazam, sis-boom-bah,
she's suddenly Jewish...

07:14.418 --> 07:16.377
like it's a-- a L'Oréal product!

07:17.377 --> 07:19.502
Ugh. Oh, God.

07:21.168 --> 07:23.126
Enough. I'm sorry.

07:24.168 --> 07:27.126
I-- I-- I'm really tired of it.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.669
We're all so tired of it.

07:29.794 --> 07:30.835
So, today...

07:32.251 --> 07:34.210
as a diversion, as an antidote,

07:34.293 --> 07:36.627
I decide I'm gonna enjoy
New York City.

07:37.210 --> 07:39.293
(SIGHS) What?

07:39.377 --> 07:42.543
Oh! (LAUGHS) I'm retired.

07:42.627 --> 07:44.085
After 45 years as a teacher

07:44.168 --> 07:45.418
in the Queens Public School
System,

07:45.502 --> 07:48.168
did I mention I'm Jewish?
(LAUGHS)

07:48.251 --> 07:50.460
And I loved it.
All those children.

07:50.543 --> 07:52.835
They gave me so much hope,
such happiness,

07:52.919 --> 07:55.251
because teaching a child
to read, you think...

07:56.126 --> 07:57.794
"Oh, that child has a chance."

07:57.877 --> 08:00.293
And not just a chance to--
to-- to go to college

08:00.377 --> 08:03.543
and get a good job, but a chance
to learn to love reading,

08:03.627 --> 08:06.418
to be curious,
to discover the whole world.

08:07.752 --> 08:09.543
Maybe even the theater.

08:09.627 --> 08:12.710
You like the theater?
Oh, you love Phantom?

08:13.210 --> 08:14.669
So that's a no.

08:14.752 --> 08:17.210
I'm kidding! (LAUGHS)

08:17.293 --> 08:19.919
Well, anyway, today,
I have a ticket

08:20.001 --> 08:21.460
for a matinee at The Public,

08:21.543 --> 08:24.585
and I have some time, so I go
to the Starbucks down the block.

08:24.669 --> 08:26.919
And I'm sitting by myself,
sipping my latte,

08:27.001 --> 08:28.627
reading the business section,

08:28.710 --> 08:30.835
which I brought
in my NPR tote bag.

08:30.919 --> 08:35.168
Mm, don't you do it, officer,
don't you mock my tote bag...

08:35.251 --> 08:37.752
(LAUGHS) Because, officer,
you want to know a secret?

08:37.835 --> 08:39.835
That's how
we recognize each other.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.251
Women like me.

08:41.877 --> 08:43.043
It's a secret code.

08:43.794 --> 08:46.585
NPR. The New Yorker.

08:48.085 --> 08:50.335
The Estée Lauder tote bag
as a gift with purchase

08:50.418 --> 08:54.126
with the Barnes & Noble
Virginia Woolf Centennial
tote bag

08:54.210 --> 08:56.794
folded up inside. Shh.
(CHUCKLES)

08:58.502 --> 08:59.585
Then I see him.

09:01.085 --> 09:02.585
Two tables away, he's...

09:04.293 --> 09:07.877
(SIGHS) He's about 40.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.168
He's wearing jeans
and a windbreaker and--

09:11.335 --> 09:12.585
and the hat.

09:14.502 --> 09:15.794
The red hat.

09:17.460 --> 09:20.460
You know the one. The MAGA hat.

09:20.543 --> 09:23.251
The "Make America
Great Again" hat

09:23.335 --> 09:27.377
in New York City,
in the East Village,

09:27.460 --> 09:29.001
two blocks
from The Public Theater,

09:29.085 --> 09:30.877
at Cooper Union,
where Lincoln spoke,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.043
and Larry Kramer!

09:32.126 --> 09:33.710
It's like me going to Nebraska

09:33.794 --> 09:35.877
wearing a yarmulke,
waving a rainbow flag

09:35.960 --> 09:38.293
while reading a book. (SIGHS)

09:38.377 --> 09:39.627
And I apologize to Nebraska.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.585
I'm sure they're very
lovely people there, but...

09:42.669 --> 09:44.960
you know their state bird
is a meadowlark?

09:46.877 --> 09:47.960
They shot it.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.502
And at first, I think,
"Miriam, don't do it. Oh, God.

09:53.585 --> 09:55.502
Miriam, don't do it.
Don't take the bait."

09:56.669 --> 09:59.585
(SIGHS) But then I think,
"Maybe he's a psychology student

09:59.669 --> 10:01.460
and it's an experiment."

10:01.543 --> 10:05.043
And then I think, "Nah.
It's a performance piece."

10:05.126 --> 10:07.585
Because in the East Village,
you never know.

10:07.669 --> 10:10.043
I once saw a naked man
standing on a street corner

10:10.126 --> 10:12.627
screaming obscenities
at a Cabbage Patch doll.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.168
Two Obies and a Drama Desk.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.001
But then it happens.

10:18.543 --> 10:20.085
He's reading the paper.

10:20.168 --> 10:23.001
Not the Times.
Something conservative.

10:24.335 --> 10:25.960
(SIGHS) And he says...

10:26.752 --> 10:28.752
And not under his breath.

10:28.835 --> 10:30.543
Right out loud, he says,

10:31.377 --> 10:32.919
"Lock her up!"

10:33.001 --> 10:36.460
And he looks all around
at the students and the tourists

10:36.543 --> 10:37.960
and me. He looks right at me.

10:38.043 --> 10:39.877
He says it again, "Lock her up!

10:39.960 --> 10:42.001
That stupid bitch Hillary,
right?

10:42.085 --> 10:43.418
She should be in jail."

10:43.919 --> 10:44.919
(HUFFS)

10:47.502 --> 10:48.543
Okay.

10:50.877 --> 10:51.877
Hillary.

10:55.043 --> 10:56.543
I know she's not perfect.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.418
She can be a little chilly,

10:59.502 --> 11:01.669
a little pleased with herself
sometimes, but to me,

11:01.752 --> 11:03.835
she's the New York Times
in a pantsuit.

11:03.919 --> 11:05.210
I love her.

11:06.043 --> 11:07.168
She's my generation.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.085
She wanted to make a difference,
so she tried everything.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.210
She pushed, she fought,
she kept her eyes on the prize.

11:14.043 --> 11:15.418
(SIGHS) And she lost.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.585
She won
by three million votes...

11:20.585 --> 11:22.752
but she lost...

11:22.835 --> 11:25.335
because the Electoral College
is a white Republican man

11:25.418 --> 11:28.919
who says,
"Not so fast, little lady."

11:34.585 --> 11:37.126
Okay. I... I feel...

11:39.126 --> 11:41.085
I really need to ask you
a question.

11:43.543 --> 11:44.710
Are you a Republican?

11:46.418 --> 11:47.460
Be honest.

11:48.418 --> 11:50.210
(GASPS) Oh, thank God!

11:50.293 --> 11:52.794
(PANTS) Because then
I'd have to gouge out your heart

11:52.877 --> 11:54.251
with my house keys.

11:55.794 --> 11:57.126
I'm kidding. (CHUCKLES)

11:58.835 --> 11:59.919
No, I'm not.

12:03.794 --> 12:05.960
If you want to know
what it means to be a woman...

12:06.960 --> 12:10.043
in America,
you just take a look at Hillary.

12:10.126 --> 12:13.043
While her husband got to be
charming and handsome,

12:13.126 --> 12:14.835
slept with everything
that moved,

12:14.919 --> 12:18.085
she had to grit her teeth
in public,

12:18.168 --> 12:20.543
and no matter what she did
or said or wore,

12:20.627 --> 12:22.585
she was attacked. (CHUCKLES)

12:22.669 --> 12:25.752
Too smart! Too opinionated.
Too blonde. Not blonde enough.

12:26.585 --> 12:28.627
(SCOFFS) And maybe...

12:30.794 --> 12:32.752
maybe people were right
about her. Maybe--

12:32.835 --> 12:36.543
maybe she was too compromised.
I... I never saw it.

12:38.835 --> 12:41.585
Maybe she wanted it too--
too nakedly...

12:41.669 --> 12:43.460
and they wanted to punish her
for that.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.210
As for me,
I'm only gonna say this...

12:48.669 --> 12:51.043
She mattered to me.

12:51.126 --> 12:53.794
(SIGHS) She was a woman
who tried her best,

12:53.877 --> 12:56.168
and the whole world said,
"Fuck you!"

12:58.627 --> 13:02.543
(SOBS) I don't know
what's happening to me.

13:03.335 --> 13:04.877
I never used to talk like this.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.627
This language,
it's so offensive.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.835
And yet,
since the election, I...

13:12.126 --> 13:14.418
I haven't been able
to stop cursing.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.877
The other day,
I bought another tote bag.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.543
It said, "Bed, Bath
and Fuck You!" (LAUGHS)

13:19.627 --> 13:22.627
So, I'm at Starbucks,
and I stand up and I walk over

13:22.710 --> 13:23.919
and I say to the guy...

13:26.210 --> 13:28.502
"So... the hat.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.669
Why are you wearing it?"

13:31.752 --> 13:35.251
And he looks me up and down,
and he smirks.

13:36.543 --> 13:37.919
And I know
I shouldn't be judging,

13:38.001 --> 13:40.126
but show me one person

13:40.210 --> 13:43.168
who voted for that man
who doesn't smirk.

13:44.418 --> 13:45.502
And he says...

13:47.377 --> 13:51.502
"I'm wearing it because
it drives you fuckin' nuts."

13:52.502 --> 13:54.168
(INHALES)

13:54.251 --> 13:57.085
(SIGHS) And I think to myself,
"Well..."

13:57.168 --> 13:59.210
(KISSES TEETH) "He's not wrong."

13:59.293 --> 14:03.919
And then I say, "But why do you
want to drive me fuckin' nuts?"

14:05.210 --> 14:08.043
And I say it clearly.
I asked the question

14:08.126 --> 14:13.460
so the "you repulsive piece
of racist shit" is silent.

14:13.543 --> 14:17.960
And he says, "Because you got
Obama. What did we get?"

14:21.835 --> 14:23.543
And I just have to
stop and think

14:23.627 --> 14:26.794
because I have no idea
what he's talking about.

14:26.877 --> 14:30.585
So I say to him,
"But what did you want

14:30.669 --> 14:32.877
that Obama didn't give you
or try to give you?

14:32.960 --> 14:36.126
Healthcare?
A-- a-- a good job?

14:36.210 --> 14:38.418
A decent place to live?
Did you want to-- did you want--

14:38.502 --> 14:40.293
did you want to feel like people
were listening to you?"

14:40.377 --> 14:43.543
He says, "Nah. What--
Yeah, whatever. Sure.

14:43.627 --> 14:46.669
But mostly, mostly," he says...

14:48.377 --> 14:51.085
"I look at people like you...

14:51.168 --> 14:56.001
in your nice clothes and your--
your bachelor's degree,

14:56.085 --> 14:59.251
your fancy coffee with
your New York  fuckin'  Times,

14:59.335 --> 15:02.460
and I think, 'Fuck you.'
You're not better than me."

15:02.919 --> 15:04.585
(SIGHS)

15:04.669 --> 15:08.293
And do you know what it took
for me not to say...

15:09.835 --> 15:11.001
"Master's degree?"

15:12.251 --> 15:13.293
But I don't.

15:14.126 --> 15:15.794
I suck it up...

15:16.960 --> 15:19.085
and I say,
"But I'm not better than you

15:19.168 --> 15:21.669
because we're all--
we're all created equal.

15:22.418 --> 15:24.001
And I would fight to the death

15:24.085 --> 15:26.085
for your right
to wear that hat."

15:26.168 --> 15:29.919
And he smirks and he's laughing
and he says,

15:30.001 --> 15:33.043
"Ha! And that's
why you're fucked!" (LAUGHS)

15:33.126 --> 15:35.877
"You did it to yourself!"
(LAUGHS)

15:35.960 --> 15:39.877
"And that's why we won,
because we don't care."

15:39.960 --> 15:41.919
And now my breathing
is getting choppy,

15:42.001 --> 15:43.418
and he sees that,
and he's really happy

15:43.502 --> 15:46.293
'cause he knows he's getting
to me. I'm taking the bait.

15:46.377 --> 15:48.794
And then he says,
"And you know what else?

15:48.877 --> 15:50.210
Hillary was never gonna win,

15:50.293 --> 15:52.460
'cause no matter what
your husband told you

15:52.543 --> 15:54.752
to shut you up,
he hated that bitch

15:54.835 --> 15:56.418
just like every other guy
in the world,

15:56.502 --> 15:58.418
and most of the women too!

15:58.502 --> 16:00.210
I dare you. Ask him."

16:00.543 --> 16:01.627
(PANTS)

16:03.377 --> 16:04.585
And then I just stop.

16:07.835 --> 16:08.835
And I don't want to.

16:08.919 --> 16:10.877
I'm fighting it
with everything that's in me...

16:12.043 --> 16:13.210
but I remember...

16:15.418 --> 16:18.168
my Nick, my husband, Nick...

16:19.877 --> 16:23.210
who marched...
who signed every petition...

16:24.168 --> 16:25.502
who taught Phys Ed.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.669
My husband, Nick,
who got cancer,

16:30.919 --> 16:32.460
but who stayed glued
to the television,

16:32.543 --> 16:35.543
who'd get so angry that I knew
it must be affecting his health,

16:35.627 --> 16:37.126
so I made him turn it off.

16:37.210 --> 16:41.377
My Nick, who was in so much pain
and on so much morphine

16:41.460 --> 16:43.502
that he-- he lapsed into a coma.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.877
And when he finally
came out of it,

16:44.960 --> 16:46.001
it was after the election.

16:46.085 --> 16:47.919
He looks up at me,
and he says...

16:49.335 --> 16:51.210
"She won. She won, right?"

16:53.418 --> 16:55.293
And I wasn't gonna tell him,
but the nurse...

16:55.377 --> 16:57.210
She didn't know any better.
She was just a kid.

16:57.293 --> 16:58.710
She said, "No." (INHALES)

16:58.794 --> 17:01.335
And she said that name,
she said the name,

17:01.418 --> 17:03.335
that man's name, and Nick...

17:03.418 --> 17:06.085
Oh my God.
Nick's eyes got so wide.

17:06.168 --> 17:08.293
(SOBS) He started choking,

17:08.377 --> 17:09.960
clenching his fist,
trying to s--

17:10.043 --> 17:11.585
trying to sit up, and then...

17:17.585 --> 17:18.877
And then he was gone.

17:22.502 --> 17:24.085
And that's what
I'll never forgive.

17:27.168 --> 17:29.585
(EXHALES) That man...

17:31.126 --> 17:34.794
that smug criminal...

17:34.877 --> 17:38.752
hateful man who uses
Metamucil for makeup.

17:40.085 --> 17:41.460
That man killed my husband.

17:43.585 --> 17:46.835
That man made a liberal
Jewish gym teacher...

17:48.126 --> 17:50.126
explode.

17:52.126 --> 17:56.043
So when that guy at Starbucks,
when that guy says,

17:56.126 --> 18:00.293
"Nick hated Hillary," I--
I snapped. I lost it.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.919
I went full-on
Worldwide Wrestling Federation,

18:03.001 --> 18:05.710
Navy Seal, Jason Bourne Goa,
and I grabbed that hat.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.043
I'm gonna throw it
on the ground,

18:07.126 --> 18:08.627
but he grabs my arm,
and he's twisting it.

18:08.710 --> 18:12.168
He says, "That's my hat, bitch!"
I said, "Not today, asshole!"

18:12.251 --> 18:14.085
And I yank my arm away,
but I keep the hat,

18:14.168 --> 18:17.710
and I run right out of Starbucks
down the street.

18:17.794 --> 18:19.085
He's chasing me
for two city blocks.

18:19.168 --> 18:21.043
Thank you, Doctor Scholl's
air cushioned insoles!

18:21.126 --> 18:24.085
And I tear up the stairs
like a fuckin' mountain climber.

18:24.168 --> 18:25.085
My heart is pounding.

18:25.168 --> 18:26.919
I'm operating
on pure adrenaline.

18:27.001 --> 18:29.168
And he's yelling,
"Give it back! Give it back!"

18:29.251 --> 18:34.752
And I say, "This is The New York
Public Theater,

18:34.835 --> 18:37.585
the home of Hamilton,
Shakespeare in the Park

18:37.669 --> 18:40.251
and A Chorus Line.
You have no power here!"

18:40.335 --> 18:42.752
And he says, "The fuck I don't!"
And he grabs the hat

18:42.835 --> 18:45.877
and he shoves me with both hands
like he wants to kill me.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.210
(PANTS) And I lose my balance,
and I'm on the floor...

18:50.543 --> 18:51.585
on my back.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.210
And he leaves...

18:56.794 --> 18:57.877
and he's laughing.

19:01.543 --> 19:02.960
And now everyone
is all gathered around.

19:03.043 --> 19:04.585
"Oh my God. Oh my God.
Are you all right?

19:04.669 --> 19:06.293
Are you all right?
Do you have a concussion?

19:06.377 --> 19:08.418
What'll we do?
Should we call 911?" And...

19:10.919 --> 19:14.043
(SIGHS) I just don't know
what to say.

19:17.377 --> 19:18.877
I got a bump on my head.

19:20.043 --> 19:21.543
I've twisted my ankle, but...

19:22.710 --> 19:23.919
I don't even care...

19:25.043 --> 19:28.335
because I-- I'm looking around,
see...

19:30.377 --> 19:33.669
and I say to myself...
(CHUCKLES)

19:33.752 --> 19:35.085
"What am I doing here?

19:37.001 --> 19:41.502
Why am I trying to see a play
and learn about the world

19:41.585 --> 19:43.543
and-- and keep up with things?

19:45.418 --> 19:46.919
What good does it do?

19:48.001 --> 19:49.377
Who does it help?"

19:54.669 --> 19:56.251
And that was the moment when...

19:58.418 --> 19:59.460
I can't say it.

20:03.251 --> 20:06.043
I can't say it. It's blasphemy.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.377
It's unthinkable.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.543
No, you know what?
I'm gonna tell you,

20:12.627 --> 20:15.001
because you really
will understand.

20:17.752 --> 20:18.919
That was the moment...

20:19.794 --> 20:22.043
when I almost cancelled
my subscription

20:22.126 --> 20:23.460
to The Public Theater.

20:25.877 --> 20:26.960
Do I shock you?

20:29.293 --> 20:30.293
But it's true.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.627
I had looked into the abyss.

20:37.043 --> 20:38.126
I said, "No more."

20:38.960 --> 20:40.210
No more five-hour plays

20:40.293 --> 20:43.460
where people in nice apartments
debate socialism.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.168
No more musicals
about Joan of Arc

20:46.251 --> 20:47.877
as she was fighting the Taliban.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.210
Because everything,

20:49.293 --> 20:52.543
my whole life,
my whole image of myself

20:52.627 --> 20:54.669
as a decent, cultured...

20:56.293 --> 20:58.627
curious human being...

20:59.293 --> 21:00.335
Why...

21:02.335 --> 21:03.710
it was just a bad joke.

21:05.585 --> 21:08.835
A cliché. (STAMMERS) Fake news.

21:12.168 --> 21:15.210
And then this young woman
comes over.

21:15.293 --> 21:17.669
She's wearing overalls,
and a pink pussy hat and--

21:17.752 --> 21:20.335
and a ring in her nose,
and not on the side, either.

21:20.418 --> 21:22.418
We're talking
the full Ferdinand.

21:22.502 --> 21:24.168
I mean, it's a look
my mother would say,

21:24.251 --> 21:26.627
"Did you have to wear that
to our Seder?"

21:28.669 --> 21:30.669
And she says her name
is Heliotrope...

21:32.126 --> 21:33.877
and she's the house manager,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.627
and she'd seen
what just happened.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.502
She brings me some water
and a ten-dollar brownie.

21:38.585 --> 21:42.460
She says, "Go see the play.
You'll feel better."

21:42.543 --> 21:44.001
And I said, "But--
but won't the play

21:44.085 --> 21:46.794
just blame all the world's
problems on gentrification

21:46.877 --> 21:49.168
and inequality
and the patriarchy

21:49.251 --> 21:50.418
with full frontal nudity?"

21:50.502 --> 21:53.669
She says, "What do you got
against nudity?" I said...

21:53.752 --> 21:58.293
(SIGHS) "Nothing, but it's
always the wrong people."

21:58.377 --> 21:59.418
(CHUCKLES)

22:02.335 --> 22:03.543
But I thought about it...

22:05.210 --> 22:06.877
because I knew I had a choice...

22:09.293 --> 22:12.043
to see the play, or surrender.

22:13.752 --> 22:16.877
To have some guts...
or give up.

22:18.001 --> 22:20.043
And I looked at Heliotrope...

22:21.585 --> 22:22.585
and I said...

22:24.877 --> 22:26.585
"I'll bet your real name
is Helen."

22:27.418 --> 22:31.126
But she was young. She had hope.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.043
And then I thought about Nick,

22:33.126 --> 22:36.335
and everything
he was so passionate about.

22:36.418 --> 22:41.210
(LAUGHS) And I looked around
at all the other theatergoers,

22:41.794 --> 22:42.877
and I thought...

22:45.377 --> 22:47.752
"Every ticket is a weapon.

22:49.251 --> 22:52.627
Fighting that guy,
fighting that bastard

22:52.710 --> 22:54.919
and fighting all the bastards."

22:56.126 --> 22:58.126
And then I thought,
"Miriam of Arc,

22:58.835 --> 23:00.293
that's who I am."

23:00.960 --> 23:02.585
Joan of Arc. Hmm.

23:03.710 --> 23:05.126
I'm Miriam of Arc...

23:05.960 --> 23:07.627
because I stand for something,

23:07.710 --> 23:09.710
and everyone in this lobby,

23:09.794 --> 23:11.752
we all stand for something...

23:13.043 --> 23:16.126
and everything
that man is afraid of,

23:16.210 --> 23:18.377
everything
he doesn't understand,

23:18.460 --> 23:19.794
everything he hates.

23:21.460 --> 23:24.627
So I got to my feet,
brushed myself off,

23:25.585 --> 23:27.085
put on some lipstick,
and I said,

23:27.168 --> 23:29.210
"Fuck you,
Mister MAGA hat dickwad.

23:29.293 --> 23:33.126
I am going to see a play."

23:33.210 --> 23:36.502
And when I get out,
there you are, officer,

23:36.585 --> 23:38.543
because that guy filed
a complaint

23:38.627 --> 23:41.168
because I'd threatened him,
which I did,

23:41.251 --> 23:44.377
and which I would do again
in a heartbeat.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.502
We want our country back,
and we are going to march

23:47.585 --> 23:50.418
and sign petitions
and register people to vote,

23:50.502 --> 23:53.418
and we are gonna watch
Norwegian detective shows on HBO

23:53.502 --> 23:56.335
because that's what we do.
We fight.

23:57.251 --> 23:58.335
We tweet.

23:58.418 --> 24:01.627
Some of us even TikTok,
whatever the fuck that is.

24:01.710 --> 24:05.168
(SIGHS) So take a good look
at me, officer.

24:05.877 --> 24:06.794
Remember my face

24:06.877 --> 24:08.835
and my drugstore
reading glasses...

24:10.669 --> 24:11.669
and my spirit...

24:13.335 --> 24:15.627
because I'm the wall.

24:18.877 --> 24:20.043
Lock me up.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.877
(CROWD CHEERING)

24:24.669 --> 24:26.168
MIKE PENCE: That institution

24:26.251 --> 24:28.335
that forms the backbone
of our society,

24:28.418 --> 24:29.794
traditional marriage.

24:29.877 --> 24:32.627
It wasn't our idea.
It was God's idea.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.293
(APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING)

24:35.377 --> 24:37.669
(CHEERING FADES)

24:37.752 --> 24:39.001
Hi, Doctor Morton.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.794
It's Mark Hesterman.
Thank you so much for seeing me.

24:43.877 --> 24:46.377
Yeah, my regular therapist,
Doctor Beret,

24:46.460 --> 24:47.877
he's recovering, thank God,

24:47.960 --> 24:49.377
but he still has a fever
and chills,

24:49.460 --> 24:50.835
and the coughing
was getting to me.

24:50.919 --> 24:51.960
(CHUCKLES) So...

24:52.043 --> 24:53.960
I'm so sorry, by the way,
to have taken you away

24:54.043 --> 24:55.960
from your friend's
drive-by baby shower.

24:56.043 --> 24:57.210
That sounds so sweet.

24:57.293 --> 25:01.001
And I would love to have a baby
at some point... ish.

25:01.085 --> 25:02.919
It's just, um... (CHUCKLES)

25:03.001 --> 25:06.502
I have been feeling
kind of stuck lately,

25:06.585 --> 25:08.835
and I think I might need
to just talk this out,

25:08.919 --> 25:11.502
otherwise my brain
might short-circuit.

25:11.585 --> 25:15.126
So... here's what's going on.

25:17.085 --> 25:18.126
I'm an actor.

25:20.335 --> 25:22.168
Have you seen me in anything?

25:22.251 --> 25:24.460
Um... (CHUCKLES) Well...

25:24.543 --> 25:28.293
I played a crusading gay
congressional intern

25:28.377 --> 25:30.543
in that ABC series
Halls of Power,

25:30.627 --> 25:33.543
which lasted a season
but won a Peabody.

25:33.627 --> 25:36.126
And I played
a rookie gay firefighter

25:36.210 --> 25:39.251
in Showtime's edgier
Five Alarm Hangover,

25:39.335 --> 25:41.001
although I died
in the third episode

25:41.085 --> 25:45.168
after sacrificing my own life
to save a Klan member

25:45.251 --> 25:47.043
from a burning church,

25:47.126 --> 25:49.710
for which I was nominated
for a Queer Spirit Award,

25:49.794 --> 25:54.210
which I know sounds sort of
like a ghost story on Bravo.

25:54.293 --> 25:56.877
And I played a quirky gay
tech guru

25:56.960 --> 25:59.960
on HBO's Early Adopters
with a six-episode arc,

26:00.043 --> 26:02.251
although they might be
bringing me back.

26:02.335 --> 26:03.543
I mean,
people on Game of Thrones

26:03.627 --> 26:05.794
get eaten by dragons,
and they come back, so...

26:06.710 --> 26:07.877
And I just booked a commercial

26:07.960 --> 26:09.710
where my boyfriend and I
go on a picnic

26:09.794 --> 26:11.585
because
we both have health insurance.

26:12.543 --> 26:16.085
So, and I--
Yes, I mostly play gay roles,

26:16.168 --> 26:17.919
and I'm totally grateful
for that

26:18.001 --> 26:21.126
because the huge majority
of actors are unemployed,

26:21.210 --> 26:26.502
and, you know, I'm-- I'm all for
queer representation. (CHUCKLES)

26:26.585 --> 26:30.085
Uh, yes. Sometimes I say "gay,"
and sometimes I say "queer,"

26:30.168 --> 26:32.293
and sometimes I just show people
a picture of myself

26:32.377 --> 26:33.502
on Halloween in high school

26:33.585 --> 26:35.919
dressed as Julianne Moore
in The Hours.  (CHUCKLES)

26:36.001 --> 26:37.919
And I love being gay,

26:38.001 --> 26:39.502
you know, which is sort of
why I'm here,

26:39.585 --> 26:41.960
because for the past three weeks
leading up to this...

26:42.877 --> 26:46.043
shutdown,
I had been auditioning

26:46.126 --> 26:48.835
over and over again for...

26:50.168 --> 26:53.085
for what could be
a breakthrough role.

26:53.168 --> 26:56.168
Not just for me, but kind of
for the entire world...

26:57.335 --> 26:59.168
because the character's name
is Fusion,

26:59.251 --> 27:02.543
and he would be the first
big-screen summer blockbuster

27:02.627 --> 27:07.168
studio tentpole
openly gay superhero.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.877
Exactly.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.835
So I have just been
sitting here.

27:11.919 --> 27:15.001
I'm-- I'm supposed to hear
from my agents and manager.

27:15.085 --> 27:17.126
They're supposed to call me
or text me or something,

27:17.210 --> 27:19.752
because even though everyone's
working from home,

27:19.835 --> 27:24.251
apparently the studio is making
their final decision today.

27:24.335 --> 27:25.835
(LAUGHS)

27:25.919 --> 27:27.627
And I know
this is probably sounding, like,

27:27.710 --> 27:29.377
very self-absorbed...

27:31.210 --> 27:34.669
but it's a lot deeper than that
because, when I was younger,

27:34.752 --> 27:37.001
I used to search every movie
and TV show

27:37.085 --> 27:40.293
for even the tiniest
hints of gayness...

27:40.377 --> 27:45.627
and yes, I had My So-Called Life
for a season.

27:45.710 --> 27:47.960
Which is why I think
I love comic books so much,

27:48.043 --> 27:52.669
because there are just
so many queer characters.

27:52.752 --> 27:55.418
You know, there's Iceman,
who used to be straight

27:55.502 --> 27:57.251
until he accepted himself
as gay,

27:57.335 --> 27:59.710
and Green Lantern is gay
in a parallel universe,

27:59.794 --> 28:03.085
and Coagula is
this incredible trans woman

28:03.168 --> 28:05.543
who can coagulate liquids
and dissolve solids,

28:05.627 --> 28:07.669
and I love Josiah Power,

28:07.752 --> 28:10.377
who is not only gay
and Black with super strength,

28:10.460 --> 28:13.126
but is also the foremost lawyer
in Metropolis.

28:13.210 --> 28:15.251
And one of my favorites
is Northstar,

28:15.335 --> 28:18.126
who's this Canadian
Olympic skier with super speed

28:18.210 --> 28:22.001
and the ability to create
these photonic energy blasts.

28:22.085 --> 28:23.460
And they have
killed him off, like,

28:23.543 --> 28:24.710
at least three separate times,

28:24.794 --> 28:26.418
and he keeps
getting resurrected,

28:26.502 --> 28:28.001
until recently,
where he was recruited

28:28.085 --> 28:31.669
by the X-Men at Xavier Academy,
where he now teaches

28:31.752 --> 28:35.669
business, economics, and French.

28:35.752 --> 28:37.877
And there are so many more,

28:37.960 --> 28:43.502
and they're all so smart
and interesting and complicated,

28:43.585 --> 28:46.502
which is probably why
I don't see them in the movies.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.585
And then there's Fusion...

28:50.335 --> 28:52.919
who is this young gay orphan

28:53.001 --> 28:55.960
who was raised in a string
of abusive foster homes,

28:56.043 --> 29:00.168
and everybody bullied him
and-- and worse.

29:01.835 --> 29:05.418
And one day, he goes to lie down
on the railroad tracks

29:05.502 --> 29:09.877
to kill himself,
when he is simultaneously

29:09.960 --> 29:12.627
run over by a train,
struck by lightning,

29:12.710 --> 29:15.752
hit by a piece
of radioactive asteroid,

29:15.835 --> 29:17.210
and his phone explodes.

29:18.335 --> 29:21.669
And all of those different forms
of energy fuse...

29:22.669 --> 29:24.168
to form his superpowers,

29:24.251 --> 29:27.794
and he travels the world
using those powers

29:27.877 --> 29:31.377
to fight racists,
sexists, and homophobes.

29:33.126 --> 29:35.335
Find me a better superhero.
(CHUCKLES)

29:36.835 --> 29:38.001
Find me a better part.

29:39.585 --> 29:43.168
And I-- I know this is sounding
so L.A....

29:45.126 --> 29:47.794
but I really want this part.
(CHUCKLES)

29:47.877 --> 29:50.710
I could act the shit
out of this part

29:50.794 --> 29:53.960
because if you, you know,
include community theater,

29:54.043 --> 29:56.126
three emotionally
unavailable ex-boyfriends,

29:56.210 --> 29:59.919
and an uncanny ability to
predict Golden Globe nominees,

30:00.001 --> 30:02.669
he and I are not that different.

30:05.710 --> 30:09.460
Yes. Well, the audition,
which is, uh, why we're here,

30:09.543 --> 30:11.543
okay, so not even
that long ago,

30:11.627 --> 30:15.126
my being gay would be a secret,
and I'd be miserable.

30:15.210 --> 30:18.168
But there has been progress,
thank God,

30:18.251 --> 30:21.460
and I am now out and proud.

30:21.543 --> 30:24.627
And I get to meet
out and proud casting directors

30:24.710 --> 30:26.502
at out and proud fundraisers,

30:26.585 --> 30:28.335
and I then get to audition

30:28.418 --> 30:30.960
for those same
out and proud casting directors,

30:31.043 --> 30:33.210
who then tell my agents
I'm too niche...

30:34.543 --> 30:39.543
or emotional or "sophisticated"

30:39.627 --> 30:41.210
or whatever
the current codes are

30:41.293 --> 30:45.251
for being just a little too
out and proud.

30:47.168 --> 30:48.710
Which is why Fusion
is so important,

30:48.794 --> 30:50.251
because originally
they were gonna cast

30:50.335 --> 30:53.001
a-- a straight actor
until, thanks to the internet

30:53.085 --> 30:55.627
and millions of Fusion fans
from the comic books,

30:55.710 --> 30:57.752
everyone said, "No way."

30:57.835 --> 30:59.960
And then they were gonna hire
a-- a closeted actor

31:00.043 --> 31:01.794
like that was
some sort of compromise,

31:01.877 --> 31:03.335
but people said, "No."

31:03.418 --> 31:06.043
Fusion can't bring his mom
to the Oscars

31:06.126 --> 31:09.251
because he's--
he's not the gay best friend...

31:10.585 --> 31:12.752
or the--
the quirky gay sidekick.

31:14.752 --> 31:18.960
He is the lead of the movie.
(CHUCKLES)

31:19.043 --> 31:22.251
He is part of the Victory League

31:22.335 --> 31:24.627
along with Power Blaster,
Death Stalker,

31:24.710 --> 31:27.919
Tornado, Blue Ultra,
and Bobcat...

31:28.001 --> 31:30.585
all of which admittedly sound
like minivans,

31:30.669 --> 31:35.126
but they are being played
by A-list straight actors.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.960
And one of them's
African American.

31:39.043 --> 31:40.168
Thank you, Black Panther.

31:40.251 --> 31:41.543
And one of them's
Korean American.

31:41.627 --> 31:43.251
Thank you, Crazy Rich Asians.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.960
And one of them's
Scarlett Johansson.

31:45.043 --> 31:47.335
Thank you, Scarlett's agent.
And--

31:47.418 --> 31:51.085
and I would be the gay one.
(CHUCKLES)

31:53.085 --> 31:54.210
And maybe it's Hollywood

31:54.293 --> 31:56.001
genuinely trying
to be inclusive,

31:56.085 --> 31:59.251
or maybe they're just doing it
to be trendy, but okay.

31:59.335 --> 32:03.043
Because in most movies...

32:03.126 --> 32:05.293
the gay character falls in love
and dies...

32:06.168 --> 32:08.251
or falls in love
and his partner dies,

32:08.335 --> 32:09.460
or falls in love

32:09.543 --> 32:12.210
and experiences approximately
30 seconds of happiness

32:13.001 --> 32:14.460
before the end credits.

32:16.418 --> 32:17.543
But this time...

32:18.835 --> 32:20.001
just maybe...

32:21.502 --> 32:26.001
the gay character could
fall in love and fucking fly.

32:30.001 --> 32:34.752
So, they send me the script,
and I decide to play it safe,

32:34.835 --> 32:38.210
you know, just straightforward,
wholesome, pure,

32:38.293 --> 32:39.794
all-American superhero

32:39.877 --> 32:43.835
who has just faced off
against the evil Valdor.

32:46.210 --> 32:48.210
So-- so, I pop a beta blocker...

32:49.126 --> 32:50.543
and I walk into the room...

32:51.710 --> 32:53.085
and I give them what they want.

33:01.001 --> 33:02.043
Don't worry, Susie.

33:03.293 --> 33:06.585
Valdor can't hurt you.
Not now. Not anymore.

33:08.085 --> 33:09.210
Not without his head.

33:11.877 --> 33:15.377
And, Susie, I want you to meet
my husband. This is Cortex.

33:16.877 --> 33:19.001
Oh, no. He's right here.
He's just invisible.

33:19.877 --> 33:22.043
He is also a superhero.

33:25.418 --> 33:27.752
Yes, he is entirely faithful.
(CHUCKLES)

33:27.835 --> 33:31.919
But more importantly,
the world has been saved

33:32.001 --> 33:34.377
by all different types
of superheroes.

33:38.293 --> 33:40.877
And I say thank you,
and I leave...

33:40.960 --> 33:42.752
wondering if any of the other
superheroes

33:42.835 --> 33:44.627
were asked about
their partner's fidelity

33:44.710 --> 33:45.627
by a five-year-old girl,

33:45.710 --> 33:48.377
and I know
I wasn't totally dropped in,

33:48.460 --> 33:50.418
but I thought maybe
that's what they wanted.

33:51.543 --> 33:53.001
And so, a week goes by,

33:53.085 --> 33:54.502
and I finally hear
from my agent,

33:54.585 --> 33:56.919
and they want to see me again.

33:58.585 --> 34:00.877
So I go back in,
and immediately,

34:00.960 --> 34:03.001
the director tells me
to forget about the script.

34:03.085 --> 34:04.752
Just go for it.

34:04.835 --> 34:08.043
Improvise. Be out there,
be beyond out there

34:08.126 --> 34:10.627
because we don't want
to play it safe with Fusion,

34:10.710 --> 34:13.794
so just-- just be super gay.

34:21.251 --> 34:23.627
Hmm. "Super gay."

34:27.919 --> 34:30.919
(CLEARS THROAT) So, I ask
if I could have a moment

34:31.001 --> 34:32.960
just out in the hall...

34:33.043 --> 34:36.418
and my first impulse is,
"Do not do this."

34:36.502 --> 34:39.126
Because whatever
you're gonna do in there...

34:40.627 --> 34:41.960
you won't own...

34:43.126 --> 34:45.710
because you're not celebrating
your queerness,

34:45.794 --> 34:47.168
that's not what this is,

34:47.251 --> 34:49.377
because it's being
demanded of you

34:49.460 --> 34:52.669
by a straight executive
who wants a cartoon.

34:55.418 --> 34:56.669
And I-- I wouldn't do that.

35:01.543 --> 35:02.627
But I'm there...

35:04.085 --> 35:05.335
at the callback...

35:06.502 --> 35:09.877
and it's Fusion,
and it's opportunity,

35:09.960 --> 35:11.877
and I panic, and I go back in.

35:14.418 --> 35:15.543
I go back in.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.543
Partly because I--
I didn't know what else to do,

35:20.627 --> 35:24.502
and partly because I was scared
of letting them down.

35:27.210 --> 35:28.210
(SCOFFS)

35:30.085 --> 35:32.377
And I did what they asked.

35:41.043 --> 35:42.085
Don't worry, Susie.

35:43.794 --> 35:46.752
Valdor can't hurt you.
Not anymore.

35:46.835 --> 35:48.627
Not without his head. (CHUCKLES)

35:48.710 --> 35:51.293
Looks like someone needed
a haircut. (CHUCKLES)

35:51.377 --> 35:55.126
Oh, and Susie, I want you
to meet my husband, Cortex.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.460
He's invisible,

35:56.543 --> 36:01.335
which means that he can do
whatever or whomever he wants.

36:03.043 --> 36:04.835
And as for Valdor,
he might've thought

36:04.919 --> 36:07.627
that the entire planet
was terrified of him,

36:07.710 --> 36:10.043
but his only real superpower

36:10.126 --> 36:13.543
was the ability
to end a pool party

36:13.627 --> 36:17.210
just by showing up, sweetie.

36:29.418 --> 36:32.251
And I say thank you,
and I leave...

36:33.251 --> 36:36.377
and I get to my car...

36:37.710 --> 36:39.377
and I start to sob.

36:41.752 --> 36:44.001
And at first,
I don't even know why.

36:44.085 --> 36:46.752
You know,
the tears are-- are flowing,

36:46.835 --> 36:48.835
and I'm trying
to detangle my feelings.

36:48.919 --> 36:50.710
Like, am I crying
because the whole thing

36:50.794 --> 36:52.835
is just so fucking cliché?

36:52.960 --> 36:57.543
Or am I crying
because I was just asked

36:57.627 --> 37:02.502
to parade all of the magic
that I love about myself

37:02.585 --> 37:04.627
in front of a room
full of strangers

37:04.710 --> 37:07.126
like I was some sort
of carnival sideshow act?

37:09.377 --> 37:12.168
And then my phone rings.
It's my agent.

37:14.293 --> 37:16.293
"They loved it.

37:16.377 --> 37:19.752
Don't change a thing.
They want to see you tomorrow.

37:19.835 --> 37:22.043
You're still in the mix."

37:22.126 --> 37:25.251
So I go home to clear my head,
and I turn on the TV

37:25.335 --> 37:28.794
to just distract myself
for a second, but I can't...

37:30.710 --> 37:32.126
because he is there.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.669
The vice president of
the United States, Mike Pence.

37:36.752 --> 37:40.168
And he's on the news
giving a speech at an army base

37:40.251 --> 37:42.627
in Missouri about a mile
from where I was born.

37:44.085 --> 37:46.085
And this is the same
Mike Pence that thought

37:46.168 --> 37:50.168
that gay marriage would cause
societal collapse.

37:50.251 --> 37:53.418
Mike Pence, who campaigned
for a constitutional amendment

37:53.502 --> 37:55.877
to ban marriage equality
because it's not--

37:55.960 --> 37:59.001
and I'm quoting him on this--
"God's idea."

38:00.168 --> 38:02.210
And he wanted to ban
gay adoption,

38:02.293 --> 38:03.460
and gays in the military,

38:03.543 --> 38:05.502
and thought the Matthew Shepard
Hate Crimes Bill

38:05.585 --> 38:08.293
was a "radical social agenda."

38:08.377 --> 38:12.877
Mike Pence, whose wife,
whom he calls "mother,"

38:14.293 --> 38:15.627
teaches at a school...

38:16.460 --> 38:19.377
that doesn't just
expel gay kids,

38:20.335 --> 38:24.418
it expels any kid
with a gay relative.

38:26.377 --> 38:27.752
And she teaches art!

38:29.877 --> 38:32.752
And here I am... (CHUCKLES)
...sitting on my couch,

38:33.377 --> 38:36.293
having just exploited

38:36.377 --> 38:40.085
all of the most charming parts
of myself...

38:41.543 --> 38:44.877
for a job I might not even get.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.502
But I agree to go back in.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.418
And I go in the next day,
and I--

38:58.502 --> 39:00.377
I haven't looked at the script,
because at this point,

39:00.460 --> 39:02.960
the whole world just--
everything feels so absurd.

39:04.251 --> 39:06.001
And I say hello to the people

39:06.085 --> 39:08.251
in their cashmere
and Converse.

39:09.585 --> 39:11.043
And I start the scene, except--

39:11.126 --> 39:14.293
except I don't do the scene
that they asked me to prepare.

39:14.377 --> 39:16.126
I picked one
from earlier in the movie,

39:16.210 --> 39:18.335
before I had caught the bad guy,
but at this point,

39:18.418 --> 39:20.502
just the sight
of them all sitting there

39:20.585 --> 39:23.126
was so disorienting that I--
I forgot the lines... (LAUGHS)

39:23.210 --> 39:26.251
...but just decided
to go ahead with it anyway.

39:35.627 --> 39:37.293
The reason the world's
in danger, Susie,

39:37.377 --> 39:39.210
is because Valdor
is still out there.

39:41.085 --> 39:44.919
And Valdor doesn't believe
in queer superheroes.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.460
He doesn't think we exist.

39:51.251 --> 39:52.460
Isn't that right, Valdor?

39:53.502 --> 39:56.877
Just think we're, what,
sight gags or punchlines?

39:56.960 --> 40:00.001
Just people you could
have prance around

40:00.085 --> 40:01.293
for your entertainment?

40:02.752 --> 40:06.126
And we could agree to disagree
that you think it's okay

40:06.210 --> 40:10.710
for doctors and nurses
to legally deny

40:10.794 --> 40:14.460
life-saving healthcare
to gay people,

40:15.210 --> 40:17.168
even in an emergency room,

40:18.794 --> 40:22.126
even during a global pandemic,

40:22.210 --> 40:25.502
because of what you call
"personal beliefs."

40:32.835 --> 40:34.168
But I'm here with my friends.

40:35.168 --> 40:36.210
Victory League.

40:38.335 --> 40:39.377
And you have...

40:40.835 --> 40:43.377
no idea what you're up against.

40:56.126 --> 40:59.669
And I say thank you,
and I leave...

41:00.794 --> 41:02.001
and then I think...

41:04.335 --> 41:07.835
"What the hell did I just do?
What did I do?"

41:12.335 --> 41:13.710
But whatever it was...

41:15.043 --> 41:16.877
that was Fusion.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.043
That was someone
that I could be proud of.

41:22.001 --> 41:24.877
And it turns out
that they admired my bravery,

41:24.960 --> 41:26.794
and I'm still in the mix.

41:26.877 --> 41:30.210
(LAUGHS, SIGHS)

41:31.085 --> 41:33.168
(CROWD CHEERING)

41:33.251 --> 41:35.627
IVANKA TRUMP: My father
not only has the strength

41:35.710 --> 41:38.543
and ability necessary
to be our next president,

41:38.627 --> 41:41.418
but also the kindness
and compassion...

41:42.710 --> 41:45.168
(CHEERING FADES)

41:45.251 --> 41:47.585
Nina, were you marching?

41:47.669 --> 41:49.418
Yeah, I was in Union Square,
but I came home

41:49.502 --> 41:52.001
so I could expedite bail money
across the country and--

41:52.085 --> 41:55.001
and-- and start a legal team,
but that's not why I'm calling.

41:55.085 --> 41:57.543
I have to talk to you. Uh...

41:58.585 --> 42:01.210
I'm shaking. I'm terrified.

42:01.293 --> 42:03.335
Nope, it's not COVID.
It's something else,

42:03.418 --> 42:06.085
and you're the only person
who's gonna get this because...

42:07.251 --> 42:09.126
okay, bear with me...

42:10.043 --> 42:11.502
because I knew her.

42:11.585 --> 42:14.126
Not well,
but she was a year ahead of us

42:14.210 --> 42:16.251
in boarding school.
Do you remember?

42:16.335 --> 42:17.669
But we would nod at each other,

42:17.752 --> 42:21.335
and she always made a point
of remembering my name

42:21.418 --> 42:24.335
and smiling and saying,
"Hi, Callie."

42:24.418 --> 42:26.543
And I'd say, "Hi, Ivanka."

42:26.627 --> 42:28.251
And she had this voice,
you know?

42:28.335 --> 42:29.960
Sort of light and feathery

42:30.043 --> 42:31.710
like a lot of the girls
at the time,

42:31.794 --> 42:34.335
which was fine,
but I remember thinking,

42:34.418 --> 42:36.126
"Is that your real voice?

42:36.210 --> 42:38.877
Is that anyone's real voice?"

42:38.960 --> 42:41.627
I know, I'm terrible.
(LAUGHS) But, you know,

42:41.710 --> 42:44.085
she really was very nice
and very sweet.

42:44.168 --> 42:46.460
She would get there
in September in a limo,

42:46.543 --> 42:48.418
in the backseat all by herself,

42:48.502 --> 42:51.585
and at first, I thought
she was a floral arrangement.

42:51.669 --> 42:54.377
And she had friends,
but she was more...

42:54.460 --> 42:56.502
sort of this floating presence.

42:56.585 --> 42:58.710
You know,
like a visiting princess.

42:58.794 --> 43:01.210
I remember discussing her
with you and Melisande,

43:01.293 --> 43:02.669
and we all agreed

43:02.752 --> 43:05.335
not to blame her
for anything her family did.

43:05.418 --> 43:06.710
'Cause it was like you said,

43:06.794 --> 43:08.835
"We have to treat her
as if she was Susan Noriega

43:08.919 --> 43:10.919
or Courtney Stalin.
It's not her fault."

43:11.001 --> 43:13.377
(LAUGHS) You-- you said that.

43:13.460 --> 43:14.585
And I would watch her,

43:14.669 --> 43:17.460
and this one time,
we were both in the library,

43:17.543 --> 43:20.877
and she was watching
something about 9/11,

43:20.960 --> 43:22.502
and she turned to me

43:22.585 --> 43:26.001
and she said,
"It's all so awful."

43:27.335 --> 43:29.251
And I knew she meant it,

43:29.335 --> 43:34.001
but it was so strange
because she smiled,

43:34.085 --> 43:37.043
and it was like she had
this natural instinct

43:37.126 --> 43:39.669
to make things better
or nicer or prettier,

43:39.752 --> 43:41.877
and I know that
that's a rich white girl thing

43:41.960 --> 43:44.877
and it's how she was raised,
which was probably scary,

43:44.960 --> 43:47.752
but then I figured out
what was really going on.

43:47.835 --> 43:48.960
Because it was something

43:49.043 --> 43:52.585
the rest of us
didn't have to deal with.

43:52.669 --> 43:55.877
She was practicing being
photographed for the tabloids.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.960
(CHUCKLES) And-- and this was
pre-Instagram, right?

43:59.043 --> 44:02.627
But it was, like, she knew.
She, uh, she saw it coming.

44:02.710 --> 44:06.210
She was like the Steve Jobs
of smiling. (CHUCKLES)

44:06.293 --> 44:09.627
That was not mean! I mean,
because she really was...

44:09.710 --> 44:12.043
she was so sweet, and...

44:12.126 --> 44:14.001
you know,
she tried all sorts of things,

44:14.085 --> 44:17.085
modeling and business school
and sweatshops

44:17.168 --> 44:19.585
and, of course,
working for her dad.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.627
But come on.
It was an opportunity.

44:22.710 --> 44:26.293
I mean, I work for my dad.
I run the foundation, which...

44:26.377 --> 44:28.877
yes, it's different from
making guest appearances

44:28.960 --> 44:30.752
on The Apprentice.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.251
Did you ever watch that show?

44:33.460 --> 44:36.126
Because her dad
would fire people,

44:36.210 --> 44:38.627
and then she would try
to make things better.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.168
The smile.
It was like she was saying,

44:41.251 --> 44:44.085
"I'm here, but I'm not.

44:44.168 --> 44:46.335
I'm part of this,
but I'm somewhere else.

44:46.418 --> 44:48.210
I'm smiling." (CHUCKLES)

44:49.418 --> 44:52.293
And then it happened.
The White House,

44:52.377 --> 44:54.919
the move to Georgetown,
the shitstorm, and...

44:56.085 --> 44:58.585
Okay. Okay, okay.
Get ready, 'cause you got--

44:58.669 --> 45:00.543
You're sitting down?
You got a glass of wine?

45:00.627 --> 45:03.752
A whole bottle, a whole case,
because this is where I come in.

45:03.835 --> 45:07.001
Because a few months ago,
before quarantine,

45:07.085 --> 45:10.669
before everything,
I get a call from my dad

45:10.752 --> 45:14.794
because Trump has invited my dad
to the White House...

45:15.960 --> 45:18.710
because I guess Trump
knows my dad

45:18.794 --> 45:20.543
because he started
the most successful

45:20.627 --> 45:22.960
Black-owned brokerage firm
in history.

45:23.585 --> 45:25.710
And so I say, "Dad...

45:25.794 --> 45:28.377
but you're not going, are you?"

45:28.460 --> 45:29.627
And he says, "Yes."

45:29.710 --> 45:33.293
He says, "I'm curious,
and you're coming with me."

45:33.377 --> 45:36.543
And I say, "No, I'm not.
Uh, there's no way in hell."

45:36.627 --> 45:38.627
And he says, "Callie.

45:39.168 --> 45:40.710
Listen to me.

45:40.794 --> 45:43.502
He's the president.
We have access.

45:43.585 --> 45:46.335
No one will know.
And you could learn something."

45:48.335 --> 45:50.960
So we fly to Washington.

45:51.043 --> 45:54.335
Yes, private. And...

45:54.418 --> 45:58.418
the car pulls up to the gates,
and I-- I wonder,

45:58.502 --> 46:00.460
"Are they gonna stop us?"
I mean, Black people

46:00.543 --> 46:03.669
at the Trump White House
who aren't Kanye?

46:03.752 --> 46:05.960
And for a second, I had this--
this image of us

46:06.043 --> 46:09.251
being dragged out of the car
and arrested,

46:09.335 --> 46:10.502
which would already be bad,

46:10.585 --> 46:13.251
but then people would also know
we were there.

46:13.335 --> 46:17.168
But the Secret Service guy
just nods and we drive through.

46:18.377 --> 46:23.293
And... when I walk
into the actual building,

46:23.377 --> 46:25.001
I get a shiver

46:25.085 --> 46:26.627
because I can't do this,
you know?

46:26.710 --> 46:29.293
This is our house. It's supposed
to be everybody's house.

46:29.377 --> 46:33.460
It was built by slaves. And yes,
Nina, I know, Barack, but...

46:33.543 --> 46:36.543
I was there,
and I am freaking out.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.835
And my dad whispers,

46:38.919 --> 46:42.085
he says, "It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

46:42.168 --> 46:43.543
Enemy territory."

46:44.669 --> 46:47.418
And an aide comes and guides us
to the Red Room,

46:47.502 --> 46:48.794
where the dinner's being held,

46:48.877 --> 46:52.377
and when we get to the room,
I feel something else.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.377
An echo.

46:54.460 --> 46:57.418
Because there aren't many tables
or other guests

46:57.502 --> 46:59.919
and the lighting is bad,

47:00.001 --> 47:02.919
so the whole place
feels a little abandoned,

47:03.001 --> 47:04.794
like a bankrupt casino,

47:04.877 --> 47:08.168
like the eyes on the portraits
are gonna move.

47:08.251 --> 47:09.251
And of course,

47:09.335 --> 47:13.377
we're the only people
of any color whatsoever.

47:13.460 --> 47:18.168
And the only way I can be there
is to feel like a spy, you know?

47:18.251 --> 47:22.001
Like I'm working undercover
like a resistance fighter

47:22.085 --> 47:24.502
dressed as a Nazi
in a Tarantino movie,

47:24.585 --> 47:27.085
which is exactly what it's like

47:27.168 --> 47:32.627
because then there she is,
Melania.

47:32.710 --> 47:36.168
And... (LAUGHS) Yes.
Oh my God. Nothing moves.

47:36.251 --> 47:37.752
Even her hair has Botox.

47:37.835 --> 47:41.710
It's like she's Dracula
with a blowout and a spray tan,

47:41.794 --> 47:44.210
and she's a birther,
so fuck her.

47:45.543 --> 47:48.919
Then he comes in. Trump.

47:50.001 --> 47:52.335
And I have to tell myself,

47:52.418 --> 47:54.335
"Remember what my dad said.

47:54.418 --> 47:56.502
You can learn something."

47:56.585 --> 47:59.085
So I pretend I don't know
anything about him.

48:01.335 --> 48:02.877
What do I think?

48:02.960 --> 48:06.669
Nice guy, friendly, works hard?

48:06.752 --> 48:10.168
No. So creepy, so disgusting.

48:10.251 --> 48:12.210
I want to run.
I want to take a shower.

48:12.293 --> 48:15.460
I mean, someone needs
to follow him with a Dustbuster.

48:15.543 --> 48:20.293
And he finally glances up
from his phone and he sees me,

48:21.043 --> 48:24.543
and I think I get the look,

48:24.627 --> 48:27.502
the rich white guy look,
which-- which is all about,

48:27.585 --> 48:30.377
"Am I pretty enough?
Am I showing enough skin?

48:30.460 --> 48:33.502
Am I good enough
to fuck maybe once?"

48:33.585 --> 48:37.377
But before he can decide,
he sees that I'm with my dad,

48:37.460 --> 48:39.919
and he comes right over.

48:40.001 --> 48:43.710
And he's grabbing my dad's hand
and he's calling him "Jack-o,"

48:43.794 --> 48:45.835
and then it hits me.

48:47.460 --> 48:49.835
Because my dad is rich...

48:49.919 --> 48:52.877
seriously rich,
richer than Trump will ever be,

48:54.001 --> 48:55.960
that's the real turn-on.

48:57.126 --> 49:00.335
And even if I was
a naked porn star...

49:01.669 --> 49:03.168
he'd rather fuck my dad.

49:04.585 --> 49:07.960
Hold on, wait.
Okay, get ready. Because...

49:08.919 --> 49:11.960
just as my dad
is introducing me, I hear,

49:12.794 --> 49:13.835
"Callie!"

49:15.001 --> 49:16.293
And it's her.

49:16.377 --> 49:18.585
And the whole scene
is so bizarre

49:18.669 --> 49:21.919
because the place
feels empty, but...

49:22.001 --> 49:23.960
the guests are all looking up,

49:24.043 --> 49:27.168
and it's like this happy,
blonde four-year-old has--

49:27.251 --> 49:30.502
has scampered
into the haunted mansion,

49:30.585 --> 49:32.460
and she's wearing all white,

49:32.543 --> 49:34.960
and she glides right over to me

49:35.043 --> 49:37.335
and she gives me
the perfect air hug,

49:37.418 --> 49:39.627
and the perfume is a lot.

49:39.710 --> 49:41.168
And she says, "Daddy,

49:41.251 --> 49:43.710
can I steal Callie away
for a few minutes?"

49:44.377 --> 49:45.960
And he gives her a nod,

49:46.043 --> 49:48.335
or he gives her tight
white dress a nod,

49:48.418 --> 49:50.085
and he says, "Sure, honey."

49:50.710 --> 49:52.043
And she says, "Come on!

49:52.126 --> 49:54.794
It's so great to see you.
This is such fun."

49:54.877 --> 49:56.377
Like we're on a play date.

49:56.460 --> 49:58.043
Or no, like she's Nancy Drew

49:58.126 --> 50:00.710
and we're exploring
the Old Mill,

50:00.794 --> 50:03.543
which we are,
because she leads me upstairs

50:04.043 --> 50:06.710
and she says,

50:06.794 --> 50:10.710
"When I first saw this room,
I knew how much you'd love it.

50:11.627 --> 50:12.960
It's the Lincoln Bedroom."

50:15.335 --> 50:18.043
Whoa. (LAUGHS) Whoa. And it's--

50:18.126 --> 50:20.669
(LAUGHS)
No. It keeps getting worse,

50:20.752 --> 50:23.085
or better, depending
on your sense of humor.

50:23.168 --> 50:28.168
So, she pats an armchair,
and then she sits on the bed

50:28.251 --> 50:30.418
and I think, "Something
is definitely up.

50:30.502 --> 50:33.043
She wants something."
And so I sit down

50:33.126 --> 50:35.919
and she cuts right to the chase
and she says,

50:37.377 --> 50:39.251
"Callie, I need you...

50:40.126 --> 50:42.669
because I know that people
hate me,

50:42.752 --> 50:44.794
and-- now, be honest--

50:44.877 --> 50:46.752
but why do you think that is?

50:46.835 --> 50:50.168
I mean, jealously,
of course, but why else?"

50:51.126 --> 50:53.460
And she's looking
right at me and...

50:54.627 --> 50:56.835
she's this glowing blonde cloud,

50:56.919 --> 50:59.210
and I decide I can't do it.

50:59.293 --> 51:03.794
I can't-- I can't just be polite
because then I'm part of it,

51:03.877 --> 51:09.543
so I say, "People hate you
because you're not qualified,

51:09.627 --> 51:12.543
but your dad hires you
to work in the White House."

51:12.627 --> 51:14.335
And she's nodding like...

51:14.418 --> 51:16.585
"Of course, of course.
And what else?"

51:17.627 --> 51:21.585
And so I say,
"The racism, Charlottesville,

51:21.669 --> 51:23.043
putting kids in cages,

51:23.126 --> 51:26.377
the way your dad treats women
and you defend him,

51:26.460 --> 51:29.877
the insults, the sneering,
the lies.

51:29.960 --> 51:32.293
All my gay friends hate you
because of Pence

51:32.377 --> 51:36.377
and the trans ban and trying
to repeal gay marriage,

51:36.460 --> 51:39.418
and you post pictures
of yourself hugging

51:39.502 --> 51:43.377
the evangelicals who said that
gay people are going to hell."

51:46.126 --> 51:47.377
And she says, "Oh...

51:48.794 --> 51:50.585
But gay people know
that I love them.

51:50.669 --> 51:51.919
I'm from New York.

51:52.001 --> 51:55.752
So I signal them quietly, like,
I tweeted 'congratulations'

51:55.835 --> 51:58.585
to that new Black lesbian mayor
of Chicago.

51:58.669 --> 52:04.168
And I'm creating so many jobs.
My dad says it's 15 million.

52:04.251 --> 52:07.335
And unemployment,
especially for minorities,

52:07.418 --> 52:10.001
has been at its
lowest levels ever.

52:10.418 --> 52:11.585
It's done."

52:12.502 --> 52:15.251
It's done. She thinks it's done.

52:16.502 --> 52:18.835
And so she keeps going,

52:18.919 --> 52:22.210
and she gives me a huge...

52:23.210 --> 52:25.960
"just between me and you"
secret smile,

52:26.043 --> 52:27.543
and it's twinkling.

52:27.627 --> 52:28.877
And she says...

52:29.710 --> 52:31.335
"But I need to
turn things around

52:31.418 --> 52:32.960
on a perception level.

52:33.043 --> 52:35.710
I need people to see Ivanka."

52:36.710 --> 52:39.377
Her brand. The third person.

52:39.460 --> 52:41.043
Then she says...

52:42.502 --> 52:46.126
"So, what if we became friends?
I mean, real pals.

52:46.210 --> 52:50.168
What if I could come to New York
and you could take me places?

52:50.251 --> 52:54.210
Because if I go to a show
or an event by myself,

52:54.293 --> 52:58.585
or, God forbid, with Kellyanne,
everyone snubs me.

52:58.669 --> 53:02.669
One person even spit because
they think I'm a traitor,

53:02.752 --> 53:04.835
but if I was with someone
like you,

53:04.919 --> 53:07.418
someone with total
social street cred...

53:08.418 --> 53:11.251
we could go to a restaurant
or a gala

53:11.335 --> 53:14.168
and you could be my angel,
my protector,

53:14.251 --> 53:17.460
my backstage pass,
my human shield."

53:18.418 --> 53:19.877
And I think, "Why?"

53:21.085 --> 53:23.293
Why does she think
she can ask me this?

53:23.377 --> 53:26.001
Because we went
to school together?

53:26.085 --> 53:27.669
Because we're both rich?

53:27.752 --> 53:29.752
I mean, who the hell
does she think I am?

53:31.001 --> 53:32.460
And then I get it.

53:34.001 --> 53:35.377
Yep, Nina, you guessed it.

53:35.460 --> 53:38.001
Because her entire fucking life,

53:38.085 --> 53:40.085
she's never heard the word "no."

53:41.627 --> 53:43.210
And then it happens.

53:43.293 --> 53:45.919
She unleashes it. The smile.

53:46.001 --> 53:48.919
The one she's been working on
for decades.

53:49.001 --> 53:50.835
The miles of lip gloss,

53:50.919 --> 53:53.460
the hint of Vaseline
on her teeth,

53:53.543 --> 53:56.126
the chin implant
slightly lowered,

53:56.210 --> 53:58.210
the pageant-ready
smoky eyeshadow,

53:58.293 --> 54:00.752
the full-on megawatt billboard

54:00.835 --> 54:04.210
advertising nothing
but greedy perfection.

54:04.293 --> 54:05.543
The product.

54:05.627 --> 54:08.919
Only this time, it's not some
failing golf resort in Scotland

54:09.001 --> 54:12.919
or a diamond tennis bracelet
on the Nordstrom website

54:13.001 --> 54:16.418
or a ghostwritten guide
to empowering women.

54:16.502 --> 54:18.585
It's all her.

54:18.669 --> 54:23.460
Total Ivanka. Dream Ivanka.
President Ivanka.

54:23.543 --> 54:27.669
And it's this blonde avalanche
just pounding towards me and...

54:28.627 --> 54:31.251
I'm paralyzed. I'm reeling.

54:31.335 --> 54:34.251
And I flash on Abe Lincoln
in the corner going,

54:34.335 --> 54:38.001
"What the fuck is happening
in my bedroom?" And...

54:39.168 --> 54:43.460
Ivanka says,
"I know it's overwhelming,

54:43.543 --> 54:45.502
but this could be so great.

54:45.585 --> 54:49.126
The two of us, a team,
a power couple."

54:49.210 --> 54:52.251
And then she stands up
and she says, "I'll call you!"

54:52.335 --> 54:53.710
And she's out the door.

54:54.960 --> 54:58.710
And Melania's hanging
somewhere upside down

54:58.794 --> 55:01.418
and her dad is touching
my dad's arm,

55:01.502 --> 55:04.960
and he's saying, "Great talk."
And then we leave.

55:05.043 --> 55:10.293
And so when we get in the air,
I ask my dad what Trump wanted.

55:10.377 --> 55:14.085
And he says, "Money,
a photo op, golf.

55:14.168 --> 55:17.251
You think he has everything
he ever wanted, but he doesn't.

55:17.794 --> 55:19.627
He never will."

55:19.710 --> 55:21.877
And I say,
"So what does he still want?"

55:22.877 --> 55:27.543
And he says,
"The thing he claims to hate.

55:27.627 --> 55:30.960
The thing he tells his
Klan rallies he doesn't need.

55:31.043 --> 55:32.877
But all he really wants
is New York.

55:32.960 --> 55:35.585
The New York Times,
to stop wearing the MAGA hat,

55:35.669 --> 55:38.502
to be rich and powerful
without being a joke.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.877
He wants something that he's
just smart enough to recognize

55:41.960 --> 55:44.210
but too clueless to achieve.

55:44.293 --> 55:45.835
He wants style and ease

55:45.919 --> 55:48.335
and to stand up
without crumbs in his lap

55:48.418 --> 55:50.460
like the Coastal Elites.

55:50.543 --> 55:53.043
Why do you think
he's so obsessed with Obama?

55:53.794 --> 55:54.919
He wants us."

55:56.251 --> 56:00.794
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this, but...

56:00.877 --> 56:05.418
for a second, I almost feel
sorry for Trump and Ivanka

56:05.960 --> 56:07.710
for being so needy...

56:09.251 --> 56:11.627
for being all alone
in the White House

56:11.710 --> 56:12.710
with only each other

56:12.794 --> 56:15.418
and the sort of people
who would be there.

56:16.543 --> 56:18.126
(SIGHS) And then today...

56:19.627 --> 56:24.126
I get a call, an hour ago,
and it's her.

56:25.126 --> 56:26.460
And she says...

56:28.251 --> 56:30.502
"Callie, it's happening!

56:30.585 --> 56:32.210
We're opening the country
back up.

56:32.293 --> 56:35.460
It's all about 2020,
so let's get started."

56:36.001 --> 56:37.293
And I'm stunned.

56:38.543 --> 56:40.210
And I say, "Ivanka,

56:40.293 --> 56:43.710
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,
Ahmaud Arbery.

56:43.794 --> 56:46.627
Do you have any idea
what's going on?"

56:47.585 --> 56:49.543
And she says,
"But didn't you see

56:49.627 --> 56:51.627
what I tweeted
the day it all started,

56:51.710 --> 56:53.710
when people needed
to hear from me?

56:53.794 --> 56:58.960
It was from the Bible. It went,
'This is what the Lord said:

56:59.043 --> 57:03.001
I have heard your prayers
and seen your tears.

57:03.627 --> 57:04.835
I will heal you.'

57:06.168 --> 57:07.502
Isn't that perfect?"

57:09.418 --> 57:10.710
And do you know...

57:12.335 --> 57:14.085
when Trump had
the National Guard

57:14.168 --> 57:17.418

this can happen.

1:08:34.335 --> 1:08:35.502
What if I listened?

1:08:36.627 --> 1:08:38.251
What if everyone
in this country,

1:08:38.335 --> 1:08:43.126
what if we all just stopped
being so angry and listened?

1:08:48.877 --> 1:08:52.960
So, I leave the kitchen,
and I look around at my family,

1:08:53.043 --> 1:08:56.543
and they're all smiling,
and I think...

1:08:58.293 --> 1:09:01.043
"Maybe this is possible.
Maybe this can work."

1:09:01.126 --> 1:09:02.710
And then my brother Travis says,

1:09:02.794 --> 1:09:05.210
"Clarissa, you know what's wrong
with you?

1:09:05.794 --> 1:09:07.502
You've got TDS."

1:09:08.168 --> 1:09:10.293
And I ask, "What's that?"

1:09:10.377 --> 1:09:13.210
And he says,
"Trump Derangement Syndrome!"

1:09:13.293 --> 1:09:16.710
(LAUGHS)
And they're all laughing...

1:09:18.085 --> 1:09:19.502
and it's like Rosemary's Baby

1:09:19.585 --> 1:09:21.251
if the Satanists
all had corndogs,

1:09:21.335 --> 1:09:23.001
and before I know it,
I'm crying,

1:09:23.085 --> 1:09:24.752
and I blurt out, "I can't!

1:09:24.835 --> 1:09:27.293
I can't do this.
I love you all so much,

1:09:27.377 --> 1:09:29.710
and I don't want to hate you
or argue with you

1:09:29.794 --> 1:09:32.335
or just grit my teeth and pass
the gravy boat and say,

1:09:32.418 --> 1:09:35.126
'No, actually, Canada doesn't
have nuclear weapons.'

1:09:35.210 --> 1:09:37.001
I can't act as if
there are two sides

1:09:37.085 --> 1:09:38.502
to questions
that don't have two sides.

1:09:38.585 --> 1:09:39.919
And Mom,
I know you're going to say

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:41.669
I'm choosing politics
over family,

1:09:41.752 --> 1:09:43.669
and maybe I am, but I can't!

1:09:43.752 --> 1:09:44.919
I can't be here!"

1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.585
And my dad drives me
to the airport,

1:09:50.669 --> 1:09:52.502
and when we pull up
outside the terminal,

1:09:52.585 --> 1:09:55.168
he says, "Hold on.
I have to tell you something."

1:09:55.251 --> 1:09:59.168
And this is the weirdest thing
of all, because my dad...

1:09:59.251 --> 1:10:02.251
he doesn't talk.
I mean, not ever.

1:10:02.335 --> 1:10:05.418
He-- he's a contractor
and a vet and a really good guy,

1:10:05.502 --> 1:10:07.168
but he's not chatty,
or huggy, or--

1:10:07.251 --> 1:10:09.669
Okay, he's the sort of person
who, if he's not interested,

1:10:09.752 --> 1:10:12.710
he shuts his eyes
and falls asleep sitting up...

1:10:12.794 --> 1:10:17.377
except for right now,
because he's looking right at me

1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:19.502
to make sure
I'm paying attention,

1:10:20.543 --> 1:10:21.627
and he says...

1:10:23.335 --> 1:10:27.377
"I have to tell you something
because I have to tell someone,

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:30.377
and if you tell your mom
or anyone else, I swear to God,

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:34.001
I'll deny it till my dying day,
and I'll kill you...

1:10:36.126 --> 1:10:37.919
but I'm not voting for him.

1:10:39.085 --> 1:10:40.251
Not this time. I can't.

1:10:40.335 --> 1:10:43.251
And it's not about the virus
or collusion or whatever."

1:10:43.335 --> 1:10:44.418
And I say...

1:10:45.585 --> 1:10:46.794
(WHISPERING) "Dad."

1:10:47.752 --> 1:10:48.960
"Dad." And he says...

1:10:50.126 --> 1:10:51.752
"John McCain.

1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:57.377
He flew 23 missions,
and then he got shot down

1:10:57.460 --> 1:11:00.168
and held prisoner
for five and a half years.

1:11:00.251 --> 1:11:02.168
He was starved and beaten

1:11:02.251 --> 1:11:04.126
so badly that
for the rest of his life,

1:11:04.210 --> 1:11:07.043
he couldn't raise his arms
over his head,

1:11:07.126 --> 1:11:11.085
and Trump, he said, 'I like guys
who weren't captured.'"

1:11:11.168 --> 1:11:14.460
And-- and I have never seen
my dad like this.

1:11:14.543 --> 1:11:17.460
It is pouring out of him.
He-- he-- he said,

1:11:17.543 --> 1:11:21.502
"Trump kept insulting the man
even after he died.

1:11:21.585 --> 1:11:23.502
Trump was making some
goddamn appearance,

1:11:23.585 --> 1:11:25.335
grinning like a baboon.
He was in front of

1:11:25.418 --> 1:11:28.210
a naval destroyer
named the John McCain,

1:11:28.293 --> 1:11:30.669
but Trump had them cover up
the name."

1:11:32.418 --> 1:11:33.877
And he stops...

1:11:34.835 --> 1:11:37.585
because
he's so furious or appalled

1:11:37.669 --> 1:11:40.460
but I-- I mean,
I have never heard my dad

1:11:40.543 --> 1:11:43.960
say this many words in a row,
but he holds up his hand,

1:11:44.043 --> 1:11:46.126
because he's not finished yet.
He-- he says,

1:11:46.210 --> 1:11:48.126
"I-- I didn't always agree
with McCain.

1:11:48.210 --> 1:11:49.960
Hell, I don't even know
if I liked him,

1:11:50.043 --> 1:11:52.377
but the man was a hero.

1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:55.627
An American hero,
and Trump's a rich boy,

1:11:55.710 --> 1:11:58.168
a five-time draft dodger
with bone spurs,

1:11:58.251 --> 1:11:59.669
and I don't even care
about that.

1:11:59.752 --> 1:12:01.377
I care about McCain."

1:12:06.543 --> 1:12:08.210
So, I hug him...

1:12:10.835 --> 1:12:14.585
and I get back on the plane,
and I fly here to Vermont,

1:12:14.669 --> 1:12:16.960
and I think,
"I'll just keep making...

1:12:17.043 --> 1:12:20.085
my meditation videos
to help people."

1:12:22.210 --> 1:12:24.710
Except I can't stop thinking
about my dad.

1:12:26.752 --> 1:12:29.085
I can't stop thinking
about everything.

1:12:31.251 --> 1:12:37.877
CROWD: (CHANTING) USA! USA!
USA! USA! USA! USA!

1:12:40.460 --> 1:12:41.710
(CHANTING FADES)

1:12:42.752 --> 1:12:45.585
I live in Wyoming,
where we've been lucky.

1:12:46.752 --> 1:12:49.251
They needed nurses in New York.

1:12:49.335 --> 1:12:52.168
My best friend, Kendra,
was volunteering.

1:12:52.251 --> 1:12:55.001
And I was--
I was really scared...

1:12:55.085 --> 1:12:58.877
but Kendra said Wyoming
is so boring, so... (CHUCKLES)

1:13:00.085 --> 1:13:02.210
Here-- here I am.

1:13:02.293 --> 1:13:04.794
It's-- it's just like
everybody says.

1:13:06.835 --> 1:13:08.669
Even the New York
doctors and nurses,

1:13:08.752 --> 1:13:10.794
they've never seen...

1:13:10.877 --> 1:13:12.835
they've never seen
anything like it.

1:13:15.251 --> 1:13:17.126
(KISSES TEETH) Uh, I just...

1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:20.126
I just got off a 14-hour shift,

1:13:20.210 --> 1:13:23.627
and I know I should probably

1:13:23.710 --> 1:13:26.543
take off my clothes,
put 'em in a plastic bag,

1:13:26.627 --> 1:13:27.960
take a shower.

1:13:28.043 --> 1:13:30.251
It's just all so surreal.

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:35.960
Mostly because
of this one patient...

1:13:38.043 --> 1:13:39.085
Miriam.

1:13:42.085 --> 1:13:43.335
I first met her, like...

1:13:44.919 --> 1:13:46.126
three weeks ago.

1:13:47.168 --> 1:13:50.043
I was working in the tent
outside the hospital

1:13:50.126 --> 1:13:51.418
doing nasal swabs,

1:13:51.502 --> 1:13:55.752
and she's all dressed up...

1:13:55.835 --> 1:14:02.335
and she's got this amazing shawl
and lipstick, and I said...

1:14:03.627 --> 1:14:05.210
"I-- I-- I like your bracelet."

1:14:05.293 --> 1:14:07.710
And she says,
"Oh, thanks. Isn't it pretty?

1:14:07.794 --> 1:14:10.502
My-- my son got it for me
after I told him to."

1:14:11.752 --> 1:14:14.043
And I said, "Are-- are--
are you headed somewhere else?"

1:14:14.126 --> 1:14:16.293
And she said, "No, I just wanted
to look nice

1:14:16.377 --> 1:14:18.585
for the doctors and nurses."

1:14:18.669 --> 1:14:20.502
And I said, "That--
that's awesome."

1:14:21.502 --> 1:14:23.001
And then she says, "I'm Jewish."

1:14:23.710 --> 1:14:25.669
And then I went, "Oh, uh...

1:14:25.752 --> 1:14:27.877
Nazel tok."  (LAUGHS)

1:14:29.251 --> 1:14:32.043
And then she says,
"You'll get there."

1:14:34.043 --> 1:14:37.877
She's smart and funny.

1:14:39.043 --> 1:14:40.960
(CHUCKLES)
After I stuck the swab

1:14:41.043 --> 1:14:43.251
all the way up her nose,
she said,

1:14:43.335 --> 1:14:46.043
she said,
"Thank you and fuck you."

1:14:47.126 --> 1:14:50.627
(CHUCKLES) And we laughed.

1:14:50.710 --> 1:14:55.543
And her temperature was 99.8,
so the doctor sends her home,

1:14:55.627 --> 1:14:57.752
tells her to monitor
her symptoms.

1:14:58.543 --> 1:15:00.293
And she says, "I know. I know.

1:15:00.377 --> 1:15:03.251
My daughter's a neurologist
in Seattle."

1:15:03.335 --> 1:15:05.794
And she turns to go,
and then she turns back

1:15:05.877 --> 1:15:08.210
and says, "Single."

1:15:08.293 --> 1:15:10.627
And then she turns to go,
and then she turns back

1:15:10.710 --> 1:15:12.877
and says, "Again."

1:15:13.752 --> 1:15:15.085
(CHUCKLES)

1:15:17.710 --> 1:15:19.669
Uh...

1:15:19.752 --> 1:15:24.251
The next time I see her,
um, I'm working the ER

1:15:25.043 --> 1:15:26.752
and she's being admitted...

1:15:27.877 --> 1:15:30.085
'cause she's up to 102
and coughing.

1:15:31.669 --> 1:15:32.752
Not-- not terrible,

1:15:32.835 --> 1:15:36.085
but the doctor just wants to do
a chest X-ray,

1:15:36.168 --> 1:15:40.960
and Miriam,
she-- she remembers me.

1:15:41.043 --> 1:15:43.085
And she says,
"You're from Wyoming, right?"

1:15:43.168 --> 1:15:44.085
And I said, "Yeah."

1:15:44.168 --> 1:15:46.418
And she says,
"So you weren't kidding."

1:15:47.293 --> 1:15:49.502
(CHUCKLES)
And then I hand her a gown,

1:15:49.585 --> 1:15:51.627
and then she says,
"Before this goes any further,

1:15:51.710 --> 1:15:53.251
I need to ask you something.

1:15:53.919 --> 1:15:55.418
Are you a Republican?"

1:15:57.210 --> 1:15:59.543
And I said, um...

1:15:59.627 --> 1:16:02.251
"No. Uh, I guess...

1:16:03.251 --> 1:16:05.126
I guess I'm--
I'm an Independent."

1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:11.377
And then she just stares at me
like Darth Vader

1:16:11.460 --> 1:16:13.877
and just says, "Oy."

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:15.627
(CHUCKLES)

1:16:15.710 --> 1:16:17.877
And I-- I ask her
what that means,

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:21.585
and she just says, "It means
that if you say that any louder,

1:16:21.669 --> 1:16:24.168
everyone in the tri-state area
will kill you."

1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:27.585
Her X-ray isn't good...

1:16:28.752 --> 1:16:30.627
but she's not showing
any advanced symptoms,

1:16:30.710 --> 1:16:33.168
but the doctor just wants to
find her a bed for observation

1:16:33.251 --> 1:16:35.627
and start her on
this experimental protocol.

1:16:37.085 --> 1:16:42.710
And she says, "You mean that--
that hydro-whatever-it-is?

1:16:42.794 --> 1:16:44.585
That-- that Trump bullshit?"

1:16:44.669 --> 1:16:47.043
And I said, "Yes, Miriam.

1:16:47.126 --> 1:16:48.919
It says right here
on the IV drip,

1:16:49.001 --> 1:16:53.251
'550 CCs of Trump Bullshit
every hour.'"

1:16:53.335 --> 1:16:55.251
And then she says,
"Oh, it's just like Fox News."

1:16:55.335 --> 1:16:57.418
And then I said, "Yeah, well,
maybe it'll start working."

1:16:57.502 --> 1:16:59.460
And she says,
"And that's what his parents

1:16:59.543 --> 1:17:00.710
said about Jared."

1:17:03.627 --> 1:17:04.794
She's tough.

1:17:06.335 --> 1:17:07.502
She's tough.

1:17:08.669 --> 1:17:10.794
I told her, I said-- I said...

1:17:12.418 --> 1:17:14.710
"I've never met
anyone like you."

1:17:16.126 --> 1:17:17.960
And she says, "What, you mean--

1:17:18.043 --> 1:17:19.794
you mean a strong,
independent woman?"

1:17:19.877 --> 1:17:23.377
And I said, "No, so much Kleenex
in your purse."

1:17:26.085 --> 1:17:28.710
(SIGHS) And then she--
she starts coughing,

1:17:28.794 --> 1:17:31.502
and I-- I guess I-- I guess
I must've looked worried,

1:17:31.585 --> 1:17:34.877
and she says, "Well,
let's hope it's cancer."

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:36.043
(LAUGHS)

1:17:37.710 --> 1:17:41.502
We don't say shit like that
in Wyoming. (LAUGHS)

1:17:44.669 --> 1:17:45.710
(SIGHS)

1:17:47.794 --> 1:17:51.168
And the days are just getting
more and more insane.

1:17:51.251 --> 1:17:53.835
The halls are filled
with patients on gurneys

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:55.251
waiting for beds.

1:17:56.210 --> 1:17:57.794
We're all wearing more
and more PPE

1:17:57.877 --> 1:18:00.085
when we can get it, and...

1:18:01.877 --> 1:18:05.502
the whole hospital just looks
like a-- a cross between

1:18:05.585 --> 1:18:08.877
a space station and--
and a subway.

1:18:12.710 --> 1:18:16.919
Now we're all just trying
to hold it together 'cause...

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.126
that's what they taught us
in nursing school.

1:18:23.085 --> 1:18:26.085
Do the job, provide comfort...

1:18:29.919 --> 1:18:32.418
because if you start crying,
you'll never stop.

1:18:36.502 --> 1:18:38.835
And one day,
we lose eight people.

1:18:41.418 --> 1:18:45.794
The next day, it's 18, 27...

1:18:49.669 --> 1:18:52.585
and the only thing
that's keeping me going is her.

1:18:54.710 --> 1:18:55.752
Miriam.

1:18:58.919 --> 1:19:00.210
Because she's stable,

1:19:00.293 --> 1:19:03.418
and I-- I keep telling myself
she's gonna make it,

1:19:03.502 --> 1:19:04.960
'cause people are making it.

1:19:06.919 --> 1:19:09.043
And I-- I take her vitals
and she's--

1:19:09.126 --> 1:19:11.001
she's got this terrible look
on her face,

1:19:11.085 --> 1:19:13.168
and I ask,
"Miriam, what's wrong?"

1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:15.085
And she points to the--

1:19:15.168 --> 1:19:16.960
to the TV
hanging up on the wall.

1:19:17.043 --> 1:19:21.418
And it's one of those
White House press briefings,

1:19:21.502 --> 1:19:25.251
and the president's talking
about how great everything is,

1:19:25.335 --> 1:19:27.669
and what an amazing job
he's doing.

1:19:27.752 --> 1:19:30.251
And Miriam's wheezing,
and she says,

1:19:30.335 --> 1:19:33.835
"I need Advil, the bedpan,
and a gun."

1:19:33.919 --> 1:19:36.835
I just said, "Miriam,
we're-- we're turning this off,"

1:19:36.919 --> 1:19:38.627
and she won't give me
the remote,

1:19:38.710 --> 1:19:40.502
and then we both hear him
talking about

1:19:40.585 --> 1:19:42.919
how we can maybe
start injecting ourselves

1:19:43.001 --> 1:19:45.251
with-- with disinfectant
or bleach,

1:19:45.335 --> 1:19:47.752
and she says,
"What is he talkin' about?

1:19:47.835 --> 1:19:49.460
Is he talking
about cleaning products?

1:19:49.543 --> 1:19:51.585
Is-- is it a Jewish disease?"
(CHUCKLES)

1:19:51.669 --> 1:19:52.835
And then she tells me,

1:19:52.919 --> 1:19:56.335
"I need 800 milligrams
of Lemon Pledge, stat."

1:19:59.126 --> 1:20:01.794
And she starts coughing,
and I said,

1:20:01.877 --> 1:20:04.794
"Miriam, you just need to--
you just need to calm down.

1:20:04.877 --> 1:20:07.377
You-- you can't--
you can't watch him."

1:20:07.460 --> 1:20:09.877
And she says,
"Don't you get it?

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:13.669
My rage is the only thing
that's keeping me alive."

1:20:17.794 --> 1:20:21.001
The doctor comes in and we have
a conversation out in the hall

1:20:21.085 --> 1:20:22.960
about putting Miriam
on a ventilator,

1:20:23.043 --> 1:20:25.627
if we can even find one,

1:20:25.710 --> 1:20:29.919
and I ask him if--
if, you know, maybe she's right.

1:20:31.126 --> 1:20:33.919
Maybe she just needs
to keep talking.

1:20:37.085 --> 1:20:39.460
And then, the next morning,
I get to the hospital

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:43.752
and there's a refrigerated truck
parked outside

1:20:43.835 --> 1:20:46.251
because there are
so many bodies.

1:20:48.919 --> 1:20:51.919
And I get to Miriam's room,
and she's doing a little better.

1:20:53.293 --> 1:20:56.043
Her cough is intermittent,
she's sipping Pedialyte,

1:20:56.919 --> 1:20:59.752
and she tells me, "Sharynn...

1:21:01.210 --> 1:21:03.502
last night, I had a dream."

1:21:03.585 --> 1:21:07.585
And she says that...
"I dreamed that when I woke up,

1:21:08.293 --> 1:21:09.877
everything was different.

1:21:10.585 --> 1:21:13.001
People were still sick, but...

1:21:13.085 --> 1:21:16.335
everyone wasn't fighting
or calling each other names

1:21:16.418 --> 1:21:19.293
or blaming everything
on the Chinese

1:21:19.377 --> 1:21:22.585
or waving Confederate flags."
And I said...

1:21:24.210 --> 1:21:27.335
"Well, in your-- in your dream,
who-- who was president?"

1:21:27.418 --> 1:21:29.377
And she said, "Me." (CHUCKLES)

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:32.543
And then I just got so busy...

1:21:32.627 --> 1:21:36.502
'cause we admitted 58 more
COVID patients in one day,

1:21:36.585 --> 1:21:41.835
and I-- I didn't have time
to check in on Miriam...

1:21:44.418 --> 1:21:46.585
because... (KISSES TEETH)

1:21:46.669 --> 1:21:50.377
four nurses tested positive
and were quarantined.

1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:52.627
I had one patient
that was giving birth...

1:21:54.627 --> 1:21:57.168
and her husband wasn't allowed
in the delivery room,

1:21:57.251 --> 1:22:00.168
and another patient was dying,

1:22:00.251 --> 1:22:03.001
and I had to hold
the phone to his ear

1:22:03.085 --> 1:22:05.835
so that his family could
tell him that they loved him.

1:22:08.669 --> 1:22:11.460
And the only thing that was
getting me through it was...

1:22:13.543 --> 1:22:14.543
her.

1:22:17.085 --> 1:22:18.627
Like, Miriam's gonna make it...

1:22:20.293 --> 1:22:22.293
'cause God wouldn't dare.

1:22:25.585 --> 1:22:27.210
Then the next morning,
she's even better.

1:22:27.293 --> 1:22:28.752
We don't need a ventilator.

1:22:28.835 --> 1:22:31.960
And I asked the doctor
if she can be discharged,

1:22:32.043 --> 1:22:34.877
and-- and he says,
"Yes, this afternoon."

1:22:35.669 --> 1:22:37.794
And I tell myself, "Okay...

1:22:37.877 --> 1:22:41.335
(INHALES)
This is what hope looks like."

1:22:43.168 --> 1:22:48.001
Later, just-- just after 2:00,
I get to Miriam's room...

1:22:49.043 --> 1:22:52.210
with a wheelchair,
and I'm picturing myself...

1:22:53.585 --> 1:22:55.418
wheeling her
out the front door...

1:22:56.710 --> 1:22:58.085
into the fresh air...

1:23:02.543 --> 1:23:04.502
while everybody cheers.

1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:11.210
But she's gone.

She couldn't breathe.

1:23:28.752 --> 1:23:30.210
We tried everything.

1:23:33.418 --> 1:23:36.168
I didn't even have enough time
to call her daughter in Seattle,

1:23:36.251 --> 1:23:39.293
and she had a living will...

1:23:41.710 --> 1:23:43.085

1:23:50.919 --> 1:23:52.585

the Javits Center...

I met Miriam's daughter,
and she's so sweet. (SNIFFLES)

1:24:44.085 --> 1:24:47.627
She gave me Miriam's bracelet,
a Playbill,

1:24:47.710 --> 1:24:51.335
and a tote bag
for Planned Parenthood.

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:55.794
(SNIFFLES) And she said
if Miriam was a Pharaoh,

1:24:56.877 --> 1:24:58.835
that's what would be
in her pyramid.

1:25:00.251 --> 1:25:05.126
And I ask her what she thinks
is gonna be on her tombstone...

1:25:06.293 --> 1:25:07.669
and she thought about it.

1:25:09.669 --> 1:25:13.335
And then at exactly
the same time...

1:25:14.377 --> 1:25:17.585
we both said, "Fuck you."

(CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES)

1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:31.835
(INHALES) I keep thinking
about ways I can honor her

1:25:32.502 --> 1:25:33.877
and what would suit her.

1:25:37.210 --> 1:25:38.543
And what would she want?
