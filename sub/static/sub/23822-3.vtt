<i>Gary and Avocato got their
butt cheeks in a hot fight.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:09.043
<i>The Lord Commander is hot
on their trail. Oh, crap!</i>

00:09.076 --> 00:11.778
<i>Now our heroes have joined
forces to protect Mooncake</i>

00:11.811 --> 00:14.514
<i>and save Avocato's son, Little Cato.</i>

00:14.547 --> 00:17.050
<i>What are they going to do?
Where are they going to hide?</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:18.451
<i>I have no idea.</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.822
<i>That's why we're watching
this episode, y'all!</i>

00:23.656 --> 00:27.361
<i>You have 7 minutes of oxygen left, Gary.</i>

00:27.394 --> 00:31.099
Phew. Look, it's Carl.
Carl, how's life?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.266
<i>Carl is dead, Gary.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:37.071
Classic Carl.
That bastard owes me 25 bucks.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.373
<i>- Mayday, mayday!
- Can you clean that up, HUE?</i>

00:39.406 --> 00:42.577
<i>I can try.
There is quite a bit of interference.</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:44.545
<i>- We need help!
- Any idea who it is?</i>

00:44.577 --> 00:47.380
<i>No, Gary.
I'm afraid not.</i>

00:47.413 --> 00:49.817
Well, maybe I can help these...

00:50.150 --> 00:52.787
Actually, I'll just chill over here.

What is this? Who's there?

01:41.535 --> 01:46.140
Your father is a coward!

01:46.173 --> 01:50.343
My father will come for me,
and he will kill you

01:50.376 --> 01:56.376
if I don't first.
Yah! Ow.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.722
Quinn, do I look any different?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.255
I should because you're looking

02:03.256 --> 02:06.294
at the most wanted man in the galaxy.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.228
Oh, look who it is!

02:08.262 --> 02:11.132
- Avocato, come say hi to Quinn.
- No.

02:11.164 --> 02:14.168
He's a bit of a grouch,
but his son has been kidnapped.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.602
Yeah. I know.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.039
Anyways, big development!
I have a robot arm.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.875
Look at this!
Oh, my god! How do I...

02:20.907 --> 02:24.044
Ahh! Ahh! Oh!

02:24.078 --> 02:28.883
I think that's all I have for you today.
Uh... give me a call, Quinn.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.551
Oh, I almost forgot.
In four days, I'm a free man.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.785
What do you say when I turn...

02:32.786 --> 02:37.091
<i> Proximity alert.
Proximity alert.</i>

02:37.123 --> 02:38.893
<i>Gary, we are taking fire</i>

02:38.925 --> 02:41.929
<i>from the Lord Commander's
heavy incinerators.</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:50.203
Grab it firm.
What do we do, HUE?

02:50.236 --> 02:54.174
<i>Calculating. I am detecting
an incursion in our proximity.</i>

02:54.208 --> 02:56.043
- A what?
- A temporal worm, Gary.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.609
<i>It's your only option.</i>

02:57.610 --> 02:59.746
A temporal worm could send
us backwards or forwards

02:59.780 --> 03:01.549
thousands of years in time, Gary.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.918
Are you sure that's
the only choice we have?

03:03.950 --> 03:05.720
Feed us to it!

03:17.298 --> 03:20.367
Whoa!

03:20.401 --> 03:22.103
Aah!

03:22.135 --> 03:26.247
Mm, pressed hams.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.612
That was wondrous!

03:32.613 --> 03:34.448
How about covering up
that dick situation

03:34.480 --> 03:37.350
- you've got going there? Jeez.
- In good time.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.121
Speaking of which, when are we?

03:40.153 --> 03:41.487
Happy?

03:41.488 --> 03:44.658
<i>Gary, we have jumped
four days into the future.</i>

03:44.692 --> 03:46.961
Wait. What? That means my last
four days of jail are up.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.830
Right, HUE? Open sesame!
Unlock my bounty!

03:50.864 --> 03:54.367
<i>Clause nine of your
imprisonment stipulates that all</i>

03:54.368 --> 03:57.938
<i>time-related disruptions have
zero effect on your sentence.</i>

03:57.971 --> 04:00.074
What? So no chocolate
treasure coins?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.310
<i>Are you referring to cookies, Gary?</i>

04:02.342 --> 04:04.444
<i>- Yes!
- Oh, then no.</i>

04:04.478 --> 04:07.581
This is a load, HUE, a load!

04:07.614 --> 04:09.950
Listen, Gary.
We're marked targets,

04:09.983 --> 04:13.220
and no matter what hole we hide in,
the Lord Commander will

04:13.221 --> 04:16.755
find us in our hole
and take Mooncake from that hole.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.491
I know that's a whole lot of holes,

04:18.524 --> 04:20.361
but we're in a whole lot of trouble.

04:20.392 --> 04:24.030
<i>- HUE?
- Avocato is correct.</i>

04:24.063 --> 04:26.167
We need to hide him
until we figure things out.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.869
Look. I've heard of a place
that safeguards fugitives.

04:28.902 --> 04:33.507
The closest one is on Yarno.
No one will find him there.

04:33.539 --> 04:38.179
HUE, spool up the engines.
We're going to Yarno.

04:40.555 --> 04:43.436
_

04:44.818 --> 04:48.856
Helper Hula, I've always
respected the Order of the 12

04:48.888 --> 04:51.359

04:51.392 --> 04:56.230
Where is E 35-1?!

04:56.263 --> 04:59.667
Ah! You're dying!

04:59.700 --> 05:02.670
Dying? Really, genius?
I know I'm dying!

05:02.703 --> 05:08.641
Every time you use your light,
you quicken your own death.

05:08.674 --> 05:14.547
That's why I need Mooncake,
or whatever that idiot calls him.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.984
I need him to live.
Tell me where he is.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.720
Patience.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.323
That wasn't very helpful.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.233
Ugh!

05:38.772 --> 05:45.847
You will find him for me,
or next time I finish the job.

05:57.323 --> 06:02.530
Gworplo! I'm Zargon Tukalishi,
and welcome to Yarn...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.936
Looks like they've made
some changes around here.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.739
You don't say, because the Deathcropolis

06:11.772 --> 06:13.541
just sounded like
a lovely church picnic.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.708
Don't worry, Mooncake.

06:15.741 --> 06:17.243
We got this.

06:17.244 --> 06:21.047
Moonobumps,
homemade moonobumps.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.884
Oh, sweet!
They're just handing out free candy!

06:24.917 --> 06:28.721
Wow. Whoa.

06:28.755 --> 06:34.161
Oh, oh,
he has a Popsicle now!

06:34.193 --> 06:36.563
Ahh!

06:38.931 --> 06:40.332
I feel so replenished.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.636
Oh, wow.
Oh! Just what is this?!

06:43.669 --> 06:46.506
There's a dart sticking
out of my chesticles!

06:46.539 --> 06:49.309
Can you not take crap
from weird alien skeevoids?

06:49.342 --> 06:53.580
Noted, "Do not take
crap from skeevoids."

06:53.614 --> 06:57.418
- Ugh. 
- Ahh!

07:01.020 --> 07:02.655
There's a quantum
gravitational disturbance

07:02.688 --> 07:04.592
emanating two parsecs from Jupiter.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.926
If my math is right,
all our lives might depend...

07:06.960 --> 07:10.364
<i>Quinn, it's Triborn.
Don't worry. I'm at your place.</i>

07:10.397 --> 07:13.767
<i>Everything is okay, but super bad news.</i>

07:13.799 --> 07:15.436
<i>You're not going to like it.</i>

07:15.469 --> 07:17.271
<i>In fact, I don't know
what happened to all the like.</i>

07:17.304 --> 07:18.704
<i>Where did all the like go?</i>

07:18.705 --> 07:21.275
- Tell me, already!
- I will tell you, already.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.144
<i>Superior Stone dispatched
an Imperium cruiser</i>

07:24.176 --> 07:25.845
<i>yesterday to apprehend you</i>

07:25.878 --> 07:30.049
<i>because you kind of broke
a lot of laws, like 47 laws.</i>

07:30.083 --> 07:31.416
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!

07:31.417 --> 07:34.486
<i>Why didn't I tell you sooner?
That is the question, isn't it?</i>

07:34.487 --> 07:36.087
<i>The answer, I've been busy.</i>

07:36.088 --> 07:37.490
Are you touching my stuff?

07:37.491 --> 07:39.126
<i>Why would I be touching your stuff.</i>

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
<i>It makes me look
so dreamy and beautiful.</i>

07:40.861 --> 07:42.962
<i>I would never be touching
your beautiful stuff.</i>

07:42.996 --> 07:47.368
<i>Quinn, an Imperium cruiser
is closing in on your position.</i>

07:50.169 --> 07:52.071
- This is the place, Gary.
- This is the place?

07:52.104 --> 07:53.806
This, right here, is the place?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.676
I'm not going down there.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.912
<i>Welcome, friends, to the
Order of 12 Yarno chapter...</i>

07:59.913 --> 08:02.214
<i>a representative will meet you shortly.</i>

08:02.215 --> 08:03.816
- How can I...
- Jeez!

08:03.849 --> 08:06.740
...help?

08:06.775 --> 08:08.340
- You got me.
- Are you a helper?

08:08.375 --> 08:12.159
Oh, no.
I assist the helpers.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.229
So you're a helper-helper?

08:16.263 --> 08:21.869
I will tell him you have...
arrived.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.171
Guy straight up ghosted
through that wall.

08:24.203 --> 08:27.723
- Live with it.
- I can't. The guy just ghosted

08:27.724 --> 08:31.679
- through that wall, yo. Ahh!
- How can I help?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.582
- We love to help.
- Thanks.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.083
Well, we need to find a safe
place for my little buddy.

08:37.116 --> 08:41.121
Sorry.
We're at capacity.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.191
Oh!

08:44.222 --> 08:47.093
But we could always squeeze in one more.

08:47.126 --> 08:52.298
- Such a precious specimen.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.135
C-Can you say that just
a little less creepy-like?

08:56.736 --> 08:58.805
Okay. I guess not.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.540
- Mooncake.
- Chocatey?

09:00.573 --> 09:04.144
No one's saying
goodbye, here. Okay?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.610
I'll be back as soon as I can.

09:05.611 --> 09:09.049
It's only temporary.
I promise.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.515
Chocatey pah.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.990
Gary, he'll be fine.
He can take care of himself.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.095
By the way, I never got
your name, mister...

09:22.129 --> 09:24.231
- Stevil.
- Whoa!

09:24.264 --> 09:25.664
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pump the breaks.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.068
Okay. The freaking guy
has "evil" in his name.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.237
I'm not handing Mooncake over
to a guy freaking named Stevil!

09:31.270 --> 09:34.041
- Stevil is a bit alarming.
- It is a bit alarming!

09:34.042 --> 09:35.476
We only want to help!

09:35.509 --> 09:36.976
Avocato, let's find another place.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.779
- Let's go.
- Stop!

09:38.812 --> 09:43.351
Okay. This is full-blown
banshee screech, alarming!

09:47.120 --> 09:50.124
- Mooncake!
- Sleep.

09:52.559 --> 09:56.530
Alert High Helper Hula
we have been most helpful.

10:04.637 --> 10:08.341
Stevil lived right up
to the evil in his name!

10:08.375 --> 10:11.378
Look! We made it to the super
safe oblivion amusement park

10:11.410 --> 10:13.179
of never-ending unsafe stairs!

10:13.212 --> 10:15.182
What fun!
Thanks, Avocato.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.649
It's a Lazarus trap.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.651
Only master trap-makers
can make these,

10:18.684 --> 10:20.218
and people who really like stairs.

10:20.219 --> 10:23.657
At least we're not sinking into, like,
a lake of lava or something.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.462
Listen to me. Anything we think
of becomes reality. Okay?

10:29.496 --> 10:32.399
Right. Okay. So we've
got to think positive.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.401
Ooh, ooh! Cookies!

10:34.434 --> 10:36.403
- No!
- Hey!

10:36.435 --> 10:38.504
Eat me! I'm delicious!
I'm a cookie!

10:38.538 --> 10:40.307
What?
It's not like I'm imagining

10:40.339 --> 10:41.673
murderous killing confections?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.697
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

10:45.178 --> 10:49.316
Everybody is super excited

10:49.348 --> 10:54.153
about today's sacrifices
at the Deathcropolis.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.091
Ooh!

10:57.124 --> 11:00.094
But you're not being sacrificed.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.262
The Lord Commander needs you.

11:03.295 --> 11:06.333
- What is he doing?
- Chocatey pah!

11:28.454 --> 11:31.090
<i>Quinn Airgon, we have
orders to arrest you </i>

11:31.124 --> 11:32.726
<i>for aerial grand theft.</i>

11:32.759 --> 11:34.561
- Chuck?
- Yes. This is Chuck.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.730
Now, please surrender,
and this all goes away.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.067
Listen, jerk nuts.
No.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.102
Did she just call me jerk nuts?

11:42.135 --> 11:46.405
<i>Oh. Okay, yeah...
Yeah. I think you are under arrest.</i>

11:46.438 --> 11:48.741
Hey! Douche canoe,
not happening.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.745
God. 
You said, "Douche canoe."

11:51.778 --> 11:53.447
<i>All right. Listen, Quinn...</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:54.913
No. You listen.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.314
<i>I'm trying to save the world, here.</i>

11:56.315 --> 11:58.285
<i>So you're going to turn
your vessel around</i>

11:58.318 --> 11:59.751
<i>and forget you ever saw me.</i>

11:59.752 --> 12:03.623
- Dude, are you crying?
- No. No, I'm not crying.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.227
It's space pollen.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.867
<i>Ah, ah, ah!
Didn't say the magic word!</i>

12:16.203 --> 12:20.473
Aaah! Why am I the only one
covered in cookies?

12:20.506 --> 12:23.977
- You have no cookies!
- Gary, de-think the cookies!

12:24.010 --> 12:26.346
Not sure that's possible.
I'm a very creative guy.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.416
Like, wouldn't it be cool
if they had, like, laser eyes?

12:29.448 --> 12:30.515
Aah! Run!

12:30.516 --> 12:33.319
- Oh, my God!
- Think of something else!

12:33.352 --> 12:35.988
- Anything else!
- What, like tridents?

12:36.021 --> 12:37.022
- No! No!
- Yeah! Yes!

12:37.023 --> 12:39.593
No! Not like tridents!

12:39.626 --> 12:41.192
I'm thinking about
little trident-wielding

12:41.193 --> 12:43.664
laser-shooting death cookies!

12:43.697 --> 12:45.332
I'm thinking of nothing,
nothing, nothing.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.267
Oh! Whoa! Oh!
Oh, my gosh.

12:47.299 --> 12:51.170
<i>- I'm going to eat your eyes out.
- And pee in your sockets!</i>

12:51.203 --> 12:54.174
<i>You're never going to leave this place.</i>

12:54.207 --> 12:56.643
Why is that one cookie
lone-wolfing it across the edge?

12:56.675 --> 12:59.512
Oh! He's leaping! Whoa!
He's like an angel!

12:59.545 --> 13:01.948
- Oh, my God...
- I'm going to kill you!

13:01.982 --> 13:03.784
It's stabbing my eyes!

13:06.252 --> 13:08.955
Ohh.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.028
Chocatey pah!

13:18.063 --> 13:21.868
To the ones who live
for the ones who die!

13:25.838 --> 13:29.376
It's not fair.
I've been good.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.311
I help people.

13:31.343 --> 13:35.681
I've been patient, unbelievably patient!

13:35.714 --> 13:39.052
Oh, Lord Commander!
I brought your medicine, sir!

13:39.084 --> 13:41.187
I put a little biscuit on the side,

13:41.221 --> 13:45.058
just for you, my special little prince.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.727
- What is this?
- Ugh! Gah!

13:47.760 --> 13:51.999
I like the much littler
kind of biscuits.

13:52.031 --> 13:55.067
I have told you this, Eric.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.404
I told you this!

13:57.437 --> 14:00.274
<i>We have been most helpful.</i>

14:00.307 --> 14:03.076
<i>We have found Mooncake.</i>

14:03.108 --> 14:05.745
My patience paid off.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.794
The more you kill,

14:20.827 --> 14:25.399
the more the Twelve Titans
beyond rejoice.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.472
Gary, we need to wake up.
Close your eyes.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.408
You want me to wake up
by closing my eyes?

14:34.440 --> 14:37.276
- That doesn't make any sense!
- Nothing makes any sense in here!

14:37.309 --> 14:40.746
All right. Good point.
Okay. I'm closing my eyes.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.216
It's not working.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.119
<i>- Hi, Gary.
- Quinn?</i>

14:46.151 --> 14:48.254
It's been a long time.

14:48.288 --> 14:53.660
- Come here. I missed you.
- Is it really you?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.294
Closer.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.831
- Gary...
- Get off me!

14:57.863 --> 14:59.163
It's part of the trap.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.668
Gary, don't listen to him.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.905
You need to trust me.
She isn't real.

15:04.938 --> 15:08.260
Are we going home, dad?

15:10.443 --> 15:13.646
Trust me, buddy.
We both need to wake up.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.652
I don't want to wake up.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.322
Then you're really not
going to want this.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.830
We're out! I saved us.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.431
- No, I saved you.
- And I, you.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.033
- No, you didn't.
- But I did.

15:34.034 --> 15:38.171
- You almost got us killed, Gary.
- Then we're even.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.404
We've got to find Mooncake!

15:39.405 --> 15:41.974
Gary, I told you Mooncake
is going to be okay.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.475
- He's a super weapon.
- Wrong!

15:43.476 --> 15:45.611
Little green ball friend
is a harmless gumball of love!

15:45.645 --> 15:48.015
- HUE, you there?
- Where have you been, Gary?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.517
It would sound too insane
to even explain.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.184
Can you lock into Mooncake's location?

15:52.217 --> 15:54.712
- Ugh!
- Uh, Gary?

15:54.820 --> 15:57.189
Little buddy.

15:57.222 --> 16:00.626
The final sacrifice awaits.

16:08.934 --> 16:13.039
<i> Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!</i>

16:22.115 --> 16:27.821
Hello, Mooncake.
I have been looking all over for you.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.392
Don't be shy.

16:33.425 --> 16:38.253
Come in and say hello.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.267
Rahh!

16:43.102 --> 16:46.039
How did I become so weak?

16:46.072 --> 16:49.241
- Mooncake!
- Doot, doot, doot, doot!

16:49.275 --> 16:50.609
- Chocatey!
- Oh!

16:50.610 --> 16:54.047
- Gary!
- It's over, The Gary.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.915
"Gary."
It's just "Gary."

16:55.948 --> 16:59.119
What is your deal, dude?
Why won't you just leave us alone?

16:59.151 --> 17:01.754
You have no idea, do you?

17:01.788 --> 17:04.256
Mooncake is the key.

17:04.290 --> 17:11.198
That being can unlock
Final Space.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.133
What the mother-loving crap
is Final Space?

17:14.166 --> 17:18.704
That's my business.
Should we play a game, Gary?

17:18.737 --> 17:21.941
I love games.
I always win.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.119
You know what I want, and I...

17:32.151 --> 17:34.587
Ya!

17:34.621 --> 17:38.158
Oh, my gosh!

17:40.793 --> 17:42.595
Sweet Grandor's glove!

17:42.596 --> 17:45.298
You are a planet-destroying
super weapon!

17:45.331 --> 17:47.400
- Chocatey!
- Whoa! Yes!

17:47.432 --> 17:49.236
That's so freaking tight!

17:49.268 --> 17:53.505
- That's not how we play the game!
- How about this game?

17:53.506 --> 17:57.977
- Ah, you missed.
- Freak. Shoot for the locks!

18:04.449 --> 18:07.286
- Gary, look out!
- Ugh!

18:07.320 --> 18:08.820
Ah! Ugh.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.964
I'm going to save you, Gary!
I'm saving you!

18:18.997 --> 18:22.369
I'm here to save you, Gary!
The day is saved.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.437
Freaking KVN!
I hate you so much!

18:24.469 --> 18:26.172
I truly can't wait for the day you die!

18:26.206 --> 18:27.974
Oh, my gosh.
No one will be sad.

18:28.006 --> 18:31.539
There will only be happiness!

18:34.881 --> 18:38.884
- Hey, Gary!
- Don't even. Just don't even.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.853
KVN has saved everything.

18:50.322 --> 18:52.997
The gravitational disturbance,
it's massive

18:52.998 --> 18:57.002
and growing... a lot...
a lot, a lot.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.437
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.208
<i>Probe failure imminent.
Probe failure imminent.</i>

19:01.240 --> 19:05.511
We need to get out of
here right now.

19:05.544 --> 19:08.414
Oh, God!
Engage rear thrusters!

19:08.448 --> 19:10.583
- Ahh!
- Ah!

19:12.951 --> 19:17.724
I am not a douche canoe!
Ahh!

19:20.360 --> 19:21.693
Ahh!

19:38.311 --> 19:40.714
Mayday, mayday!
This is Quinn Airgon.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.583
Can someone hear me?
Help me!

19:45.752 --> 19:47.954
<i>I've processed your scan of all prisoner</i>

19:47.986 --> 19:50.223
<i>transfers out of Tera Con Prime.</i>

19:50.256 --> 19:53.125
<i>There is no match for Little Cato.</i>

20:03.636 --> 20:05.805
Mooncake?

20:05.838 --> 20:08.907
- What's wrong, bud?
- Mm.

20:08.908 --> 20:14.480
I get it. So you shoot a murder
beam out of your face hole.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.883
So what? I mean, it happens
to the best of us.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.220
I mean, just the other
day I had a burrito,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.656
and you should have saw
the freaking murder beam

20:22.688 --> 20:24.022
that came out of my ba...

20:24.023 --> 20:25.524
And, you know,
it's actually pretty sweet,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.160
if you think about it.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.261
I mean, I just want you to know
that that doesn't change

20:29.294 --> 20:32.997
- anything between you  and this guy.
- Me?

20:32.998 --> 20:34.598
- Not you!
- Chocatey!

20:37.437 --> 20:38.704
Him.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.037
It doesn't make you the bad guy.

20:40.038 --> 20:41.372
It really doesn't.
I mean, it makes the scum

20:41.373 --> 20:44.177
who want to use you
as the weapon the bad guy.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.412
Look, you're a good guy to the max core.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.416
- Ohh!
- I'm never going to let you go again.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.352
I now know the only one
I can trust with you

20:52.384 --> 20:54.653
is my own awesomeness.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.856
Mm!

20:56.889 --> 20:58.591
I'm starting to like these.

20:58.623 --> 21:00.057
Mm.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.861
<i>Gary, I am receiving a mayday call.</i>

21:02.894 --> 21:04.863
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is Quinn Airgon!</i>

21:04.897 --> 21:07.534
<i>Can someone hear me?
Help me!</i>

21:07.566 --> 21:10.636
Oh, my crap. It's Quinn.
