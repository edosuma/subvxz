it's Ron Howard calling.</i>

00:05.078 --> 00:07.947
Um, I'm prepping a movie
right now that I'm gonna direct.

00:08.164 --> 00:09.381
<i>You would be perfect.</i>

00:10.116 --> 00:11.037
I would?

00:11.062 --> 00:12.117
Can you do that?

00:12.273 --> 00:13.796
- JACK: <i>What are you doing?
- RANDALL: If I can find people</i>

00:13.820 --> 00:15.054
who roll their tongue,

00:15.088 --> 00:16.625
they could be my birth parents.

00:16.656 --> 00:18.296
You know we have
to tell the girls, right?

00:18.726 --> 00:21.529
We're gonna foster a kid, bring
another child into the home.

00:21.554 --> 00:22.953
They need to know about it.

00:22.996 --> 00:25.097
What if we get a kid
that has serious issues

00:25.131 --> 00:27.179
that we're not prepared for?
I'm worried.

00:27.204 --> 00:28.375
I have been drunk

00:29.085 --> 00:30.171
<i>for weeks.</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:32.468
<i>And I need to get a handle on it</i>

00:32.926 --> 00:35.027
<i>before I can walk back into that house.</i>

00:35.052 --> 00:38.688
If you have a problem,
we will fix it together.

00:38.933 --> 00:42.375
You know, you never really talk
about your dad's death.

00:43.016 --> 00:44.210
(crying)

00:44.468 --> 00:46.531
KATE: <i>We-we have to find Kev.</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.578
He needs to hear it from me.

00:53.390 --> 00:54.796
JACK: It's been three weeks now.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.679
And, um...

00:57.859 --> 00:59.365
I finally feel like

00:59.773 --> 01:02.429
I'm tackling this thing for real.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.358
So that's good.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.498
I know I'm supposed to talk
more to you guys,

01:10.523 --> 01:14.046
um, really bare my soul.

01:14.750 --> 01:15.968
(laughs softly)

01:16.531 --> 01:19.429
Feels like you get extra
credit around here for...

01:20.014 --> 01:21.335
for crying. (Chuckles)

01:22.416 --> 01:23.554
Um...

01:30.697 --> 01:35.492
I-I promised my wife
that we would talk more,

01:36.036 --> 01:37.039
this time.

01:38.316 --> 01:39.359
But, um...

01:42.542 --> 01:44.312
I'm finding that harder to do.

01:46.079 --> 01:47.093

I'm almost done, just doing my steps.

02:10.370 --> 02:11.503
Okay.

02:11.717 --> 02:13.765
- Well, I'll see you up here.
- Okay.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.711
JACK: <i>I know that men,
we're supposed to talk</i>

02:18.745 --> 02:20.546
<i>about their issues nowadays.</i>

02:20.580 --> 02:23.390
You know, the strong
silent type is out, and...

02:24.601 --> 02:28.854
and guys like that sensitive kid
on <i>My So-Called Life</i> are in.

02:28.888 --> 02:29.906
(chuckles)

02:30.070 --> 02:32.578
At least, that's what
my daughter taught me.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.562
Um...

02:34.961 --> 02:39.539

02:41.109 --> 02:42.935
Sleep, baby. You need to go to bed.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.078
I will.

02:44.445 --> 02:46.572
- Is everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.921 --> 02:47.968
Okay.

(typing)

02:57.450 --> 02:58.617
<i>Still young.</i>

03:00.213 --> 03:04.226

cavemen like me.

It's been three weeks, Beth.

Three weeks since we've
been approved to foster.

03:52.655 --> 03:53.790
Oh, damn. Bolognese.

I love it when you cook your feelings.

I just don't understand
what's taking so long.

03:57.001 --> 03:59.002
Right? We got a bedroom set up.

03:59.027 --> 04:01.198
Got the girls on board.
Look at this place.

04:01.223 --> 04:04.557
There's two staircases,
kitchen island the size of Maui.

04:04.582 --> 04:05.995

- Mm. Do not get excited.
- Hold on.

04:11.488 --> 04:14.245
Okay, the last time you got
excited, it was <i>Vanity Fair</i>

04:14.270 --> 04:16.113
calling to see if we wanted
to renew our subscription.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.675
- I know. I didn't...
- And the time before that,

04:17.699 --> 04:19.129
it was the wrong number
looking for "Johnny."

04:19.153 --> 04:20.683
I know. We should get
rid of the landline.

04:20.707 --> 04:22.432
So I'm gonna answer this phone, okay?

04:22.457 --> 04:24.471
But I am sure it is not an agent

04:24.504 --> 04:26.024
- calling with a kid for us.
- (whispers): Oh, my God.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.065
- Answer the phone, woman.
- (chuckles)

04:28.914 --> 04:29.914
Hello?

04:30.517 --> 04:31.651

04:46.906 --> 04:48.495
- (pen clatters)
- Well?

04:49.612 --> 04:50.987
Her name is Deja.

04:51.598 --> 04:55.267
- As in "déjà..."
- Vu, yeah. She's 12 years old,

04:55.301 --> 04:57.878
and she's been in and out of
foster care a bunch of times,

04:57.903 --> 04:59.331
and her mom just got arrested,

04:59.356 --> 05:00.716
so they moved her out of her home.

05:00.812 --> 05:01.893
What about the dad?

05:01.918 --> 05:03.979
They said we'll get
the case file in a couple days.

05:04.831 --> 05:07.346
- And?
- And she's on her way over.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.432
Wow.

05:11.104 --> 05:13.582
This is it. It's happening, Beth.

05:13.607 --> 05:14.557
I know, baby.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.174
I really think that being a
foster parent was my calling.

05:17.263 --> 05:20.132
Like that call was my calling calling.

05:20.205 --> 05:22.237
- Randall...
- To honor my parents' legacy,

05:22.262 --> 05:24.049

I know, it's very moving.

05:26.232 --> 05:28.362
- But I want you to breathe...
- Mm-mm. Tess! Annie!

05:28.387 --> 05:30.587

05:35.328 --> 05:37.620
Everybody on <i>The Manny</i>

05:41.081 --> 05:43.683
Anyway, thank you so much for coming
and hanging out with me today.

05:43.707 --> 05:44.832
You know it means a lot to me, right?

05:44.856 --> 05:45.876
Are you kidding?

05:45.901 --> 05:48.430
I can't believe Sylvester
Stallone is in your movie.

05:48.454 --> 05:50.316
I can't believe it, either. I know.
It's unbelievable.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.643
So, so first up today,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.069
we have this, like,
super emotional scene, right?

05:54.093 --> 05:55.629
Right before we go
into battle, where I deliver

05:55.653 --> 05:58.237
this epic monologue about how
every single thing in my life

05:58.467 --> 05:59.901
has led up to this very moment.

06:00.146 --> 06:01.959
Which is crazy, because
everything in your life

06:01.983 --> 06:03.253
<i>has</i> led you to this moment.

06:03.604 --> 06:06.071
I know. Right? And then,
tonight, we have this,

06:06.105 --> 06:07.527
just, unbelievable
action sequence, right,

06:07.551 --> 06:10.118
where I get to go in there and
save Sylvester Stallone's life?

06:10.338 --> 06:11.362
Can you imagine?

06:11.387 --> 06:13.792
I'm on a movie set, saving
Sylvester Stallone's life?

06:14.870 --> 06:16.425
(Sylvester Stallone impression):
Every champion was once

06:16.449 --> 06:18.011
a contender who refused
to give up. You...

06:18.035 --> 06:19.276
SYLVESTER STALLONE: Not so bad.

06:19.533 --> 06:20.963
- (laughs)
- Oh.

06:21.343 --> 06:23.678
Oh, Lord. Ah, Mr. Stallone,
how are you?

06:24.032 --> 06:25.544
- How are you?
- Kevin Pearson here. Yeah.

06:25.568 --> 06:27.495
- Mm-hmm.
- KEVIN: Uh, AKA Lieutenant Booker.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.808
- Mm.
- Please don't kick me off your set

06:28.832 --> 06:30.332
for doing a horrendous
Rocky impression.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.293
I think I'll let it slide.
Anyway, it's good to meet you,

06:32.317 --> 06:33.996
- Kevin.
- Hey, good to meet you, too. I... oh!

06:34.020 --> 06:35.245
- Uh, my sister Kate.
- Oh.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.120
- Yeah.
- Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you.

06:37.145 --> 06:38.590
- She's happy to meet you, too. Say hi.
- (chuckles)

06:38.614 --> 06:40.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:40.273 --> 06:42.674
- Sylvester Stallone.
- No. "Sly." Sly is good.

06:42.699 --> 06:44.549
- Okay. Sly.
- Mm-hmm.

06:44.826 --> 06:46.753
- (Kate giggles)
- Is... I'm starving.

06:46.778 --> 06:49.221
I'm gonna go check out
the, uh, frittata situation

06:49.246 --> 06:50.675
so I'll catch up with you guys later.

06:50.699 --> 06:52.259
- KEVIN: All right.
- Nice to meet you, Kate.

06:52.283 --> 06:53.315
Okay. You, too.

06:53.786 --> 06:55.424
- Enjoy your frittata.
- Bye.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.487
(Kevin chuckles)

07:00.554 --> 07:01.619
(laughs)

07:01.662 --> 07:02.873
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

07:02.897 --> 07:04.632
Um, Sylvester Stallone knows my name.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.299
You name has never sounded cooler.

07:06.753 --> 07:08.370
Oh, my God, I wish Dad was here.

07:08.756 --> 07:09.917
Ugh!

07:10.472 --> 07:12.112
- Stallone was his hero.
- I know.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.123
God, he would've been

07:13.148 --> 07:14.214
- so proud of you, Kev.
- Right.

07:14.238 --> 07:15.440
I mean, to see this set,

07:15.465 --> 07:17.347
and all you've accomplished.
What you've gone through.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.332
Yeah, but I mean, he-he can't
see it, though. Right?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.674
So, uh...

07:22.012 --> 07:24.049
Check that out. All right?
You know what we should do?

07:24.073 --> 07:25.699
- Mm-mm.
- We should take a selfie in the tank.

07:25.723 --> 07:27.058
Send it to Randall?
He'll get a kick out of that.

07:27.082 --> 07:28.682
- Come on.
- All right.

07:28.734 --> 07:31.487
KATE: He was like,
"Oh, call me Sly." What?

07:34.448 --> 07:36.471
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning. -Morning.

07:36.691 --> 07:38.002
REBECCA: Can I make you some breakfast?

07:38.026 --> 07:39.096
No, I'm good.

07:39.121 --> 07:40.885
I'm gonna get something along the way.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.518
Okay.

07:43.698 --> 07:44.776
Bye.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.424
- KATE: Bye, Dad.
- KEVIN: See you.

07:49.226 --> 07:50.236
Hmm.

07:54.026 --> 07:56.775
KEVIN: Hey, Randall. Who do you think's
hotter, Brandy or Mariah Carey?

07:56.799 --> 07:57.831
They're both really hot.

07:58.104 --> 08:00.121
How are you playing
"Who's Hotter" right now?

08:00.148 --> 08:01.651
Our family's falling apart.

08:01.753 --> 08:03.151
Mom and Dad are barely talking.

08:03.176 --> 08:04.655
Oh, my God, Kate. They're fine, okay?

08:04.679 --> 08:06.010
Hey, Randall. Come on.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.456
Would you tell her they're fine?

08:07.512 --> 08:08.518
They're fine.

08:09.724 --> 08:12.182
I got to run a... quick little errand.

08:12.207 --> 08:13.332
I'll-I'll see you guys after school.

08:13.356 --> 08:14.338
An errand?

08:14.363 --> 08:15.635
I'm sorry, are you Mom?

08:15.660 --> 08:16.682
(Kate chuckles)

08:20.065 --> 08:22.346
Uh, I put an ad in the paper
looking for my birth parents.

08:23.050 --> 08:24.088
Yeah.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.190
This woman wrote back.

08:28.101 --> 08:29.479
She says she's my mom.

08:31.893 --> 08:33.268
Meeting her at Schenley Park.

08:34.561 --> 08:35.659
Give me that.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.640
KATE: Hi, Headless Soldier Number Two.

08:41.181 --> 08:42.596
Are you following me?

08:42.734 --> 08:44.128
- Mm-mm.
- (laughs)

08:45.120 --> 08:46.378
Explain something to me.

08:46.403 --> 08:47.956
Why do they always have to put melon

08:47.981 --> 08:49.487
and fruit and things in the water

08:49.512 --> 08:50.952
like, you know, like, there's, like,

08:50.977 --> 08:52.057
swamp animals in there.

08:52.082 --> 08:54.229
I remember when water... ready for this?

08:54.254 --> 08:55.971
- Was just water. What happened?
- (laughs)

08:55.996 --> 08:57.722
- I know, tell me about it.
- (laughs): I know.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.081
- Anyway.
- Yeah.

09:00.421 --> 09:01.549
Sylvester Stallone?

09:02.768 --> 09:04.079
I don't want to take up
much of your time,

09:04.103 --> 09:05.343
I just want to tell you that...

09:05.768 --> 09:08.403
(exhales) ...you were our
dad's favorite actor.

09:08.711 --> 09:10.206
- Oh, thank you.
- I mean, we watched

09:10.231 --> 09:11.801
all your movies, like, a thousand times.

09:11.825 --> 09:13.703
- Really? I appreciate that.
- Yeah. And seriously,

09:13.727 --> 09:15.565
- I know <i>Rocky</i> by heart.
- So does Kevin.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.542
And we would watch it
when we had a cold,

09:17.567 --> 09:19.480
- when my dad had a cold, even...
- Really? You know what?

09:19.504 --> 09:21.714
Why don't you bring your father
down to the set sometime?

09:21.738 --> 09:23.276
Since he's such a fan and everything,

09:23.301 --> 09:25.026
we'll take a picture.
It'd be my pleasure.

09:25.051 --> 09:26.737
Oh, no, um...

09:26.801 --> 09:28.846
Our dad actually died
when we were in high school.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.518
- I'm s...
- So.

09:31.239 --> 09:32.239
(exhales sharply)

09:32.516 --> 09:33.620
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

09:33.645 --> 09:35.279
You know, you just
made my dad feel good.

09:35.304 --> 09:37.799
You could help him forget
a 102 degree fever,

09:38.390 --> 09:39.917
or a bad day at work.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.323
I just, you know,
I just want to thank you

09:44.348 --> 09:45.932
for making my dad feel good.

09:46.056 --> 09:47.785
Thank you for telling me that.
You're welcome.

09:47.809 --> 09:48.838
I really appreciate this.

09:48.863 --> 09:50.018
- Very sweet.
- Yeah.

09:50.142 --> 09:51.362
- Thank you.
- Ah.

09:51.387 --> 09:52.393
(chuckles)

09:52.948 --> 09:54.073
- Hey.
- Hmm.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.963
You don't really know
all of <i>Rocky</i> by heart, do you?

09:56.988 --> 09:58.300
- You questioning me?
- (chuckles)

09:58.324 --> 10:02.049
(singing "Gonna Fly Now" by Bill Conti)

10:02.123 --> 10:04.237
"November 25th, 1975, Philadelphia."

10:04.262 --> 10:06.492
- We pan down from the Jesus mural.
- Oh, come on.

10:06.517 --> 10:07.879
- This is unbelievable. Yeah?
- Right? When you're,

10:07.903 --> 10:09.261
- when you're in the ring.
- Yeah. I'm impressed.

10:09.285 --> 10:10.378
- Okay.
- Okay. You're...

10:10.403 --> 10:12.026
- Don't question me.
- "Yo, Adrian."

10:12.283 --> 10:13.799
You're the new Adrian.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.362
Oh, my God.

10:15.387 --> 10:17.885
So, now I have Amber
Monday through Friday.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.393
Miguel has her on the weekends.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.886
And we bought Amber a car
so she would hate us less.

10:21.911 --> 10:23.807
But, um, it's not working.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.862
(chuckles)
I'm sure she's just

10:26.568 --> 10:28.471
- adjusting, still.
- Mm...

10:32.148 --> 10:33.620
So how have you and Jack been?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.518
I mean, since your fight.

10:36.645 --> 10:37.971
- We're fine.
- Yeah?

10:39.018 --> 10:41.792
Yeah. I mean, we mumble "hello"
to each other in the morning,

10:42.012 --> 10:44.174
and we, uh, kiss each other
good night before bed.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.401
Mm.

10:47.826 --> 10:49.737
When was the last time you had sex?

10:50.470 --> 10:51.612
It's been a while.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.901
- Becca...
- What?

10:53.975 --> 10:55.768
- Have sex with Jack.
- (scoffs)

10:56.214 --> 10:58.370
- It's not that simple.
- You're wrong.

10:58.395 --> 11:01.196
I am telling you, if you let
so much time go by

11:01.463 --> 11:04.229
that the answer to that question
is "It's been a while..."

11:04.771 --> 11:07.456
That was the beginning
of the end for me and Miguel.

11:11.532 --> 11:12.706
(sighs)

11:14.112 --> 11:16.446
I mean, I guess I could plan...

11:16.755 --> 11:18.503
- a night away from the kids.
- Yeah.

11:18.528 --> 11:20.526
But the whole romantic
date night thing,

11:20.551 --> 11:22.276
that's always been Jack's department.

11:22.301 --> 11:23.720
SHELLY: <i>So now it's your department.</i>

11:23.744 --> 11:25.588
<i>Come on, just think of something.</i>

11:25.613 --> 11:27.168
<i>Think of somewhere special to take him.</i>

11:27.192 --> 11:29.660
<i>Do something. Put on a pretty dress.</i>

11:29.840 --> 11:32.487
<i>Slap a big carefree smile on your face</i>

11:32.512 --> 11:34.980
<i>and just sweep your
husband off his feet.</i>

11:35.736 --> 11:36.956
What's all this?

11:37.110 --> 11:38.526
I'm Jack Pearsoning you.

11:41.281 --> 11:42.582
That's a term I made up for when you

11:42.606 --> 11:43.870
sweep someone off their feet.

11:45.534 --> 11:47.370
Come on, get in the car.

11:54.159 --> 11:56.745
That is so pretty, Annie.
She's gonna love it.

11:57.018 --> 11:59.745
Okay, people, let's get
our game faces on.

11:59.846 --> 12:01.104
Remember what we learned?

12:01.129 --> 12:03.170
When she gets here, we'll
give her a tour of the house,

12:03.194 --> 12:05.370
repeat our names a lot
so that she learns them,

12:05.455 --> 12:07.760
keep asking if she has any questions.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.417
It was on all the foster parents blogs.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.128
How do you spell "Deja"?

12:11.271 --> 12:14.284
D-E-J-A. I hope.

12:14.887 --> 12:16.167
- (doorbell rings)
- RANDALL: Ah.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.917
- (exhales) Here we go.
- Alright.

12:23.656 --> 12:25.167
Hey there. Come in, please.

12:28.043 --> 12:29.543
- LINDA: Hi, guys.
- BETH: Hi.

12:29.578 --> 12:30.643
This is Deja.

12:32.072 --> 12:33.151
RANDALL: Hi, Deja.

12:35.159 --> 12:37.776
It's really nice to meet you.
I'm Randall.

12:38.384 --> 12:39.393
I'm Beth.

12:41.058 --> 12:42.338
We're so happy to have you here.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.927
This is Tess and Annie.

12:45.336 --> 12:46.885
- TESS: Hi.
- ANNIE: Hi.

12:48.117 --> 12:49.182
Hi.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.706
ANNIE: I made this for you.

12:52.808 --> 12:54.760
(audio drops very low):
This is our snack drawer.

12:54.785 --> 12:56.379
You can help yourself
to anything you want.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.139
And the white board over there

12:58.173 --> 12:59.453
is where we make our grocery lists.

12:59.477 --> 13:01.299
So if you ever have
any special requests,

13:01.324 --> 13:02.604
just put 'em down right there.

13:02.710 --> 13:03.963
I want to go to bed.

13:05.404 --> 13:06.404
Bed.

13:06.796 --> 13:07.963
No, bed we can do.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.758
I'm gonna leave you guys
to get to know each other.

13:12.987 --> 13:14.010
Bye, Deja.

13:14.136 --> 13:15.213
I'll walk you out.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.401
Sorry, Linda? Is that it?

13:20.686 --> 13:22.159
Are you just leaving?

13:22.812 --> 13:24.182
'Cause I don't think she's okay.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.190
That is correct.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.807
- She is most definitely not okay.
- Okay.

13:28.991 --> 13:30.784
She just got yanked out of her family,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.456
plopped down with a bunch of strangers.

13:32.481 --> 13:33.737
So, what do we do?

13:34.299 --> 13:35.432
In most of the blogs I read,

13:35.457 --> 13:37.151
the kids were a bit more responsive.

13:37.414 --> 13:39.448
Well, I'd tell you, the...
the first night

13:39.473 --> 13:42.299
is the hardest part, but I'd be lying.

13:43.646 --> 13:45.565
You and your family,
you're doing a great thing.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.378
Just be patient,

13:47.615 --> 13:49.583
have zero expectations and...

13:50.288 --> 13:53.112
don't try to predict
how a single day will turn out.

13:55.062 --> 13:57.221
It's not exactly your temperament, huh?

13:57.870 --> 13:59.393
- I'm working on it.
- (laughs)

13:59.583 --> 14:01.918
Okay, you've got my number
if there's an emergency.

14:02.014 --> 14:04.449
I'll reach out tomorrow
when we get her full file

14:04.474 --> 14:06.713
- from Child Services.
- Okay. Thank you.

14:12.021 --> 14:13.213
(exhales)

14:17.573 --> 14:18.878
(indistinct conversation)

14:28.472 --> 14:30.667
Whatever happens out there,
I will fight like hell

14:31.253 --> 14:33.087
I will protect my men,
and I guarantee you,

14:33.121 --> 14:34.922
by nightfall, I'll have you
back in your bunk

14:34.956 --> 14:37.331
writing those dirty letters
that your wife likes so much.

14:38.548 --> 14:39.940
You got my word on that.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.500
Boom!

14:45.534 --> 14:46.659
That's the one.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.534
KATE: You really don't think
I'm too old?

14:48.559 --> 14:49.698
No way.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.239
I don't know if anyone
believes I, you know,

14:52.274 --> 14:54.095
can make a living
at being a singer, so...

14:54.120 --> 14:56.768
No, it really doesn't matter
what other people think.

14:56.901 --> 14:58.104
Seriously. No.

14:58.683 --> 15:00.094
I'll tell you what people didn't think.

15:00.118 --> 15:01.596
They didn't think I could write <i>Rocky</i>

15:01.620 --> 15:04.056
in three days... it happened.

15:04.081 --> 15:06.316
I'll tell you something else, they
didn't think I could act in it.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.581
Guess what, it happened.

15:07.815 --> 15:10.009
Sometimes, people can be real idiots.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.929
- Real idiots. Real.
- I'm telling you,

15:11.963 --> 15:13.493
- it's, like, contagious.
- (laughs)

15:13.518 --> 15:15.599
- Yo, yo. Guys.
- KATE: Hey.

15:15.634 --> 15:17.407
- How are we?
- You got a great sister here.

15:17.432 --> 15:19.170
Yes, I do. Thank you for noticing.

15:19.204 --> 15:20.805
We like here a lot.
We're gonna keep her.

15:20.839 --> 15:23.007
- KATE: Thank God.
- All right, guys, we are lit

15:23.041 --> 15:24.394
- and ready for you on set, gentlemen.
- KEVIN: All right.

15:24.418 --> 15:25.846
- Okay, great.
- Knock 'em dead.

15:26.003 --> 15:27.315
- Will do.
- See you around.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.534
- Okay.
- Here we go.

15:28.766 --> 15:31.100
My sister didn't ask you
to sign anything, did she?

15:31.125 --> 15:33.144
I had to beg her to leave her
Rambo figurines at home.

15:33.168 --> 15:34.229
(chuckles)

15:34.254 --> 15:35.905
We were just talking about her singing.

15:35.930 --> 15:36.760
Yeah.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.628
Yeah, she mentioned
your father a little bit.

15:39.088 --> 15:41.315
He'd be really proud of you.
Look at this.

15:42.034 --> 15:43.534
I keep hearing that, yeah.

15:43.559 --> 15:45.870
Nah, it's got to be tough
not having him here.

15:45.897 --> 15:47.057
- I get it.
- Yeah.

15:47.082 --> 15:49.385
It was a long time ago,
you know, for me, so...

15:52.339 --> 15:53.792
It's a funny thing,

15:54.651 --> 15:56.237
when you think about it... time.

15:56.378 --> 15:58.807
Your sister sings a couple
of bars of <i>Rocky,</i>

15:59.000 --> 16:03.487
and for a split second
I can smell the ring again.

16:04.776 --> 16:07.611
And then she tells me that
when you were little kids,

16:07.636 --> 16:09.128
you watched a lot of my movies,

16:09.153 --> 16:11.121
and I'm thinking for a
moment about my kids,

16:11.146 --> 16:13.190
when they were little... the messy hair,

16:13.995 --> 16:15.995
the matching pajamas
and all that stuff...

16:16.020 --> 16:17.667
and I swear to you, I can see it all

16:18.178 --> 16:20.260
so very clearly I could just
reach out...

16:21.770 --> 16:22.799
...touch it.

16:23.845 --> 16:26.784
In my experience, Kevin,
there's no such a thing

16:26.809 --> 16:28.612
as "a long time ago."

16:29.815 --> 16:31.917
There's only memories
that mean something

16:31.942 --> 16:33.479
and memories that don't.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.620
Right.

16:41.005 --> 16:43.507
Let's do one for your father.

16:43.940 --> 16:45.940
- Okay?
- Okay, you guys want to run the lines,

16:45.965 --> 16:48.979
- or you want to just roll?
- Let's roll. Good?

16:49.004 --> 16:50.378
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:51.324 --> 16:52.924
SLATE GUY: Scene 58, take one.

16:53.081 --> 16:54.924
RON: And action.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.307
Sir, first of all, I want to thank you

16:58.332 --> 16:59.370
for everything.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.104
And I want you to know...

17:06.318 --> 17:08.346
I'm sorry, uh, I need a line, please.

17:08.371 --> 17:10.683
WOMAN: "I want to thank you for
everything you've done for me.

17:10.707 --> 17:12.565
And, sir, whatever happens..."

17:12.589 --> 17:14.151
Got it. Okay. Thank you.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.963
- Could we... Sorry.
- That's all right.

17:16.053 --> 17:17.464
KEVIN: Sorry, Ron.
Could we get back into it?

17:17.489 --> 17:19.393
Yeah, yeah, no problem. Just keep going.

17:19.519 --> 17:21.198
RON: And action.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.260
First of all, thank you, sir,

17:23.363 --> 17:25.130
- Mm.
- ...for everything.

17:25.220 --> 17:26.229
Uh...

17:27.887 --> 17:30.393
Guys, can we... It's not, uh...

17:30.418 --> 17:33.153
I can see all the, uh,
the movement back there.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.213
- Sorry.
- (sighs)

17:34.238 --> 17:35.386
- Nah, I heard it, too.
- Yeah.

17:35.410 --> 17:37.018
Yeah, no problem. Just go from the top.

17:37.043 --> 17:39.643
- Thank you.
- RON: Here we go... still rolling.

17:43.964 --> 17:45.338
What's the word?

17:45.570 --> 17:46.838
- The first word.
- "I."

17:47.424 --> 17:49.362
"I wanted to thank you..."

17:49.387 --> 17:50.566
Just the first word's all I needed.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.207
Thank you, though,
for all the rest of them.

17:52.231 --> 17:53.581
- All right.
- Sorry, guys.

18:08.308 --> 18:09.963
I got you a new toothbrush.

18:10.694 --> 18:12.542
The bathroom's just
down the hall to the left.

18:30.268 --> 18:31.987
- (whispering indistinctly)
- Hi.

18:32.332 --> 18:33.534
How we doing in here?

18:35.336 --> 18:36.635
Can we give her back?

18:38.448 --> 18:40.424
No, baby, we can't give her back.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.251
Why would you want to do that?

18:42.275 --> 18:44.018
She didn't like my painting.

18:44.282 --> 18:46.417
(sighs) I don't think that's true.

18:46.753 --> 18:48.284
I think she's just shy.

18:48.448 --> 18:49.909
She barely talks.

18:51.151 --> 18:54.019
Tess, put yourself in Deja's shoes.

18:54.245 --> 18:55.798
- It's a brand-new house...
- DEJA (in distance): Hey. Hey!

18:55.822 --> 18:57.230
- ...brand-new family.
- DEJA: Why do you have these?

18:57.254 --> 18:58.834
- Those are mine.
- ...putting away your clothes...

18:58.858 --> 18:59.869
You said this was my room.

18:59.893 --> 19:00.760
- It is your room...
- No!

19:00.785 --> 19:02.285
- Give 'em back, you bitch!
- Hey. Wait a minute.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.706
Whoa, whoa, what's the matter?

19:03.731 --> 19:04.815
BETH: Hey...

19:06.731 --> 19:09.003
Hold on. We're okay.

19:10.374 --> 19:12.057
Right? We're okay. Everybody's okay.

19:12.082 --> 19:14.338
No, everything is... yeah.

19:26.688 --> 19:27.924
WOMAN: Is it you?

19:28.906 --> 19:30.096
Who posted the ad?

19:31.953 --> 19:34.393
I couldn't remember which
park I said to meet at.

19:37.454 --> 19:38.760
I see how you're looking at me.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.018
Your dad just had really dark skin.

19:42.768 --> 19:44.424
You said in your ad that, um,

19:44.449 --> 19:47.698
you didn't need money, so I thought,

19:47.723 --> 19:49.807
"Well, my boy's doing well."

19:49.832 --> 19:53.104
Uh, if you don't need money,

19:53.339 --> 19:54.885
then you have money, right?

19:54.910 --> 19:57.331
You have money?
Where you going?

19:59.152 --> 20:00.167
Wait.

20:01.428 --> 20:03.167
- Randall, what...
- It's not her. Let's go.

20:04.332 --> 20:05.466
KATE: Randall, wha...

20:06.531 --> 20:07.564
Randall.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.549
I see what you're doing now.

20:10.628 --> 20:12.697
We came here for one
of our first dates.

20:12.722 --> 20:14.487
REBECCA: <i>One of our best dates.</i>

20:14.599 --> 20:16.735
JACK: So that explains
the Chevelle, the burgers,

20:16.760 --> 20:18.484
but no concert tonight.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.444
No concert that night, either.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.071
Yeah, 'cause it got rained out.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.221
Uh-huh. So we stayed in the car.

20:25.385 --> 20:27.206
And we listened to Billy on the radio.

20:27.231 --> 20:28.940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:41.295 --> 20:43.072
I was thinking that maybe we...

20:43.232 --> 20:45.065
we could eat our burgers later.

20:45.889 --> 20:47.120
Oh.

20:47.857 --> 20:49.158
Okay. Okay.

20:49.192 --> 20:50.192
(closing bag)

20:52.051 --> 20:54.378

21:20.189 --> 21:21.713
Just-just wait for just...

21:21.738 --> 21:23.518
just, ba-baby, just slow-slow down.

21:24.315 --> 21:25.875
- Maybe just... slow down a bit.
- Okay.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.751
- Okay?
- Yeah.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.975
I'm sorry. There's just been
a lot going on lately, you know?

21:34.472 --> 21:36.551
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- No, I...

21:36.583 --> 21:40.085
Yeah, this was a really, um...
this was silly

21:40.720 --> 21:42.661
- to plan our thing like this.
- No, it...

21:42.801 --> 21:43.934
Oh, I...

21:44.966 --> 21:46.176
(Rebecca sighs)

21:55.889 --> 21:57.122
She calmed down.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.216
I told her we'd all talk
about it in the morning

21:59.240 --> 22:00.450
after we got some rest.

22:00.631 --> 22:02.142
Tess and Annie are a little freaked out,

22:02.166 --> 22:03.745
so they're gonna sleep
in the same room tonight,

22:03.769 --> 22:05.103
but I turned on the baby monitor

22:05.128 --> 22:06.669
so we can hear if anything is going on.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.793
Really?

22:08.177 --> 22:09.721
You didn't even get out the baby monitor

22:09.745 --> 22:12.083
- the first night William was here.
- Oh, I didn't?

22:15.583 --> 22:17.396
I can't believe I thought
I was gonna win this girl over

22:17.420 --> 22:19.981
by repeating our names
and giving her a tour.

22:20.754 --> 22:21.918
It's pretty stupid.

22:22.505 --> 22:23.622
Not stupid.

22:24.227 --> 22:25.301
Hopeful.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.551
Every time someone's told me
something was gonna be really hard,

22:30.681 --> 22:32.254
it hasn't been that hard.

22:33.711 --> 22:37.622
SATs, biz school, New
York City Marathon,

22:37.906 --> 22:40.043
I study or I train... (sucks teeth)

22:40.974 --> 22:42.512
...it's not that hard.

22:46.661 --> 22:48.403
I think this might finally be the thing

22:48.428 --> 22:50.200
that's as hard as everyone says it is.

22:51.779 --> 22:53.286
It's only been three hours.

22:55.231 --> 22:57.879
Everybody said there's gonna be
lots of high and lows.

22:58.841 --> 22:59.887
RANDALL: Right.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.356
Did you see the way she flinched, Beth?

23:09.841 --> 23:11.918
- I mean, somebody must've really...
- Yeah.

23:15.734 --> 23:16.848
(quietly): Yeah.

23:23.415 --> 23:24.825
Hey.

23:24.919 --> 23:27.473
Oh, that was so good.

23:27.498 --> 23:29.766
Off to a rocky start, no pun intended,

23:29.791 --> 23:32.292
but gosh, once you got going,
it was awesome.

23:32.317 --> 23:34.981
Kate, why would you tell Sylvester
Stallone about our dad?

23:36.463 --> 23:37.793
I just wanted to thank him.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.630
Yeah, okay, because, you know
what, him bringing up to me

23:39.654 --> 23:41.734
two seconds before the scene
started really threw me.

23:42.544 --> 23:43.809
- Oh.
- Yeah.

23:43.834 --> 23:45.887
Well, I... I'm sorry.

23:47.296 --> 23:48.473
It kind of seems that

23:48.687 --> 23:50.973
it throws you no matter
who brings him up or when.

23:52.090 --> 23:53.612
What are you talking...
that's not true.

23:53.636 --> 23:55.286
- That's not true at all.
- Come on, Kev.

23:55.311 --> 23:57.446
- You-you never talk about it.
- Well, you know what,

23:57.471 --> 23:59.700
so, 'cause I don't want
to wallow in sadness about it,

23:59.725 --> 24:01.341
- I have a problem?
- Okay, there is a difference

24:01.365 --> 24:02.950
between wallowing and actually having

24:02.975 --> 24:04.333
a normal conversation about it.

24:04.358 --> 24:06.254
- Mm-hmm.
- There is.

24:06.936 --> 24:09.210
- Okay.
- And, you know what, when I went to my

24:09.235 --> 24:10.763
- weight-loss camp and
- I, you know what,

24:10.787 --> 24:12.068
- I saw a therapist...
- here's the thing about that, though,

24:12.092 --> 24:13.709
- And she asked me about Dad's death...
- right now, I don't have time

24:13.733 --> 24:15.599
for that. I got an action scene
that's coming up and I don't have time

24:15.623 --> 24:18.023
- to talk about this right...
- And I couldn't talk about it.

24:18.449 --> 24:20.161
I couldn't talk about it.

24:21.589 --> 24:22.911
And you know what she told me?

24:23.897 --> 24:27.122
She told me that if I don't
learn to face my grief,

24:27.312 --> 24:29.973
that it would be like
taking in a deep breath

24:29.998 --> 24:33.333
and holding that breath
for the rest of my life.

24:34.855 --> 24:35.856
That's great.

24:35.881 --> 24:37.708
No, that-that, I mean,
that's-that's great.

24:37.733 --> 24:39.028
I just, I... (laughs)

24:40.106 --> 24:41.142
(exhales)

24:41.317 --> 24:42.810
There's nothing for me
to let out, Kate.

24:42.834 --> 24:44.098
I don't... there's not.

24:44.123 --> 24:46.465
- I think that...
- Our dad died and it's very sad, okay?

24:46.490 --> 24:47.536
- Mm-hmm.
- It's very sad,

24:47.561 --> 24:48.873
but I don't need therapy because of it.

24:48.897 --> 24:50.320
- You might.
- And I don't need to go

24:50.344 --> 24:53.372
to some-some exercise class
and scream my head off about it.

24:53.397 --> 24:54.830
And here's what I really don't want.

24:54.854 --> 24:58.083
I don't need to be talking
to Sylvester Stallone about it

24:58.181 --> 25:00.653
two seconds before the biggest
scene of my entire career.

25:00.678 --> 25:02.637
I'm sorry... I am.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.348
Yeah, well, you know,
I-I-I don't, I'm not like you.

25:06.373 --> 25:07.852
We're different people.
I don't need to walk around

25:07.876 --> 25:09.786
and be sad and damaged
just because you are.

25:17.079 --> 25:18.879
- Okay, wait. Hold on a sec...
- (door slams)

25:19.171 --> 25:20.333
(sighs)

25:26.645 --> 25:27.676
Sorry.

25:28.336 --> 25:29.528
It's fine.

25:40.257 --> 25:43.262
You know, it's a lot
harder than I thought.

25:44.163 --> 25:45.372
AA...

25:47.645 --> 25:48.864
talking to you.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.418
It's just all harder.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.793
Yeah.

25:54.896 --> 25:55.973
I can tell.

25:56.709 --> 25:57.709
Well...

26:04.379 --> 26:07.801
You know, my life
before I met you, Bec...

26:08.920 --> 26:10.028
it wasn't great.

26:11.387 --> 26:14.043
I just kind of tried
to get away, you know?

26:14.855 --> 26:16.590
Get away from my neighborhood.

26:19.062 --> 26:21.739
Get away from my father.

26:22.104 --> 26:24.051
Just get away from everything.

26:25.452 --> 26:29.098
But now they say that
if I want to fix myself,

26:29.422 --> 26:30.833
I've got to sit in that.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.043
I've got, I've got to sit

26:34.334 --> 26:37.293
in all the ugly, horrible years.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.942
And they say that
on the other side of it,

26:40.717 --> 26:41.754
there's relief.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.090
That's what they say.

26:45.864 --> 26:48.918
But I feel like I'm...

26:51.061 --> 26:54.833
holding on... by a thread.

27:03.216 --> 27:05.458
I love the night
that you planned for us.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.708
But it's been awhile since we...

27:10.482 --> 27:13.278
And I didn't want the
first time again to...

27:16.631 --> 27:21.200
I didn't want to feel
like I was feeling.

27:22.758 --> 27:23.918
(Jack sighs)

27:25.369 --> 27:28.418
Baby, you are the
strongest person I know.

27:30.727 --> 27:32.473
- I don't know.
- But I do.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.750
I know.

27:38.350 --> 27:39.426
I know.

27:44.576 --> 27:45.661
I know.

27:47.668 --> 27:48.708
Okay.

27:52.582 --> 27:53.754
(sighs)

27:56.206 --> 27:57.372
Where are you going?

27:57.567 --> 27:59.301
I'm gonna get back in the car

27:59.326 --> 28:00.942
'cause I miss talking to you...

28:02.234 --> 28:04.497
and I'm not ready to stop yet.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.223
(chuckles)

28:41.772 --> 28:42.872
What do you want?

28:43.183 --> 28:45.637
So, um, who's in charge here?

28:45.662 --> 28:48.264
Your mom and dad, like,
who makes all the rules?

28:48.885 --> 28:50.747
They both do, but...

28:51.486 --> 28:53.387
- (both) Mom.
- Okay.

28:54.112 --> 28:56.356
Um, what happens if you break the rules?

28:56.904 --> 28:59.590
She has us talk about it
for, like, a million years

28:59.687 --> 29:02.286
and sometimes you might lose
iPad privileges.

29:02.311 --> 29:04.012
What's losing iPad privileges?

29:04.219 --> 29:06.708
ANNIE: It means you can't use
your iPad for a while.

29:08.031 --> 29:09.832
You guys have your own iPads?

29:09.857 --> 29:10.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:11.965 --> 29:13.942
(scoffs)
This house is crazy.

29:23.047 --> 29:25.786
ANNIE: If you open that door,
the alarm will go off.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.950
Oh.

29:27.477 --> 29:28.844
Where are you going?

29:33.682 --> 29:35.528
Well, I'm having trouble sleeping.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.614
First night in a new place, I guess.

29:38.867 --> 29:41.598
Where I'm from, there's lots
of noise in the streets.

29:42.129 --> 29:43.473
It's so quiet here.

29:44.047 --> 29:46.418
- You're scared?
- No, I'm not scared.

29:46.443 --> 29:47.512
It's just...

29:50.151 --> 29:51.879
Do you know how to turn off the alarm

29:51.904 --> 29:54.059
so I can leave without
waking everyone up?

29:54.217 --> 29:56.122
Yeah, the code is my birthday,

29:56.345 --> 29:57.676
but you should stay.

30:05.531 --> 30:07.379
Oh, I don't think so, sweetheart.

30:09.442 --> 30:11.762
I came by today to meet
your mother and you kiddos

30:11.787 --> 30:12.981
and see your house.

30:15.676 --> 30:17.825
Your dad seems like the best...

30:19.386 --> 30:21.340
work friend a guy could ask for.

30:23.512 --> 30:25.270
But I been sleeping in my apartment,

30:25.295 --> 30:27.918
doing things my way for a long time.

30:30.938 --> 30:32.406
What if I'm bad at...

30:36.852 --> 30:39.239
I just don't want to let
any one of you down.

30:42.954 --> 30:45.965
Once I went to sleep over
at my friend Lucy's house,

30:46.532 --> 30:50.661
and I got scared and my parents
had to pick me up.

30:51.634 --> 30:53.418
Later, I was sad I went home

30:53.443 --> 30:56.676
because I probably would've
had fun if I had stayed.

30:57.012 --> 30:58.200
Is that right?

30:59.386 --> 31:02.364
So, maybe if you stay
here, you'll have fun.

31:02.711 --> 31:05.458
And if you go home, you'll be sad.

31:06.657 --> 31:07.864
You think so?

31:14.057 --> 31:15.208
Okay, then.

31:16.879 --> 31:20.379
Hey, can you show me how to turn
on the lights in the bathroom?

31:20.445 --> 31:22.754
Yeah. You just walk in
and wave your hands.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.153
- (chuckles)
- (giggles)

31:26.997 --> 31:28.918
This house is crazy.

31:31.713 --> 31:34.075
You can sleep in the reading
chair if you're scared.

31:34.692 --> 31:36.715
- I'm not scared.
- ANNIE: Okay.

31:41.419 --> 31:42.614
Okay, fine.

31:43.108 --> 31:45.429
DEJA (over monitor): Just because
the bed in my room sucks.

31:45.651 --> 31:46.856
It's too squishy.

You and your unit are gonna save him.

32:03.090 --> 32:05.059
Remember now,
he's like a father to you.

32:05.302 --> 32:06.606
And he's gonna die on your watch

32:06.633 --> 32:08.234

- Right.

Do you remember the time

33:30.333 --> 33:32.833
when-when she convinced you
to get a crew cut?

33:32.997 --> 33:35.865
It was not a crew cut,
it was a pixie cut,

33:35.890 --> 33:38.254
and I think I looked very chic,
thank you.

33:38.279 --> 33:40.411

(insects chirping)

33:51.993 --> 33:53.059
Becca, I...

33:56.346 --> 33:57.348
(sighs)

33:57.519 --> 34:02.520
I borrowed money from my
dad to buy our house.

34:04.075 --> 34:05.114
(Jack sighs)

34:05.622 --> 34:07.890
I was embarrassed that-that I...

34:08.098 --> 34:10.418
couldn't provide for us without him.

34:12.409 --> 34:13.542
Oh, Jack.

34:13.567 --> 34:14.606
And there's...

34:16.833 --> 34:18.598
there's a lot of other stuff, too.

34:19.262 --> 34:21.208
Uh, that I buried away.

34:22.940 --> 34:24.590
And I'll tell you...

34:26.036 --> 34:27.262
eventually, just...

34:29.061 --> 34:30.184
I'm working on it.

34:33.481 --> 34:35.043
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

34:36.857 --> 34:37.871
Yeah.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.606
Of course.

34:41.725 --> 34:43.262
I'm ready when you are.

35:12.168 --> 35:13.767
- RANDALL: Have a good day, man.
- Thank you.

35:13.791 --> 35:14.934
(door closes)

35:18.735 --> 35:20.575
They just sent over Deja's file.

35:20.730 --> 35:21.856
BETH: And?

35:25.319 --> 35:26.879
Her mom's in big trouble.

35:30.929 --> 35:31.950
(exhales)

35:33.415 --> 35:35.364
- (knocking on door)
- Hey.

35:35.856 --> 35:37.364
- Hey.
- KEVIN: We, uh,

35:37.389 --> 35:38.909
just wanted to see how you were doing.

35:39.973 --> 35:42.356
Yeah, you didn't say much
on the bus ride home.

35:45.050 --> 35:46.122
Oh, I'm fine.

35:50.462 --> 35:51.575
So, Deja.

35:51.897 --> 35:53.817
I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

35:54.801 --> 35:55.840
Thank you.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.481
And those are not my cigarettes.

35:58.506 --> 35:59.692
They're my mom's.

35:59.873 --> 36:02.840
I wanted to have them to give
to her when she picks me up.

36:05.803 --> 36:07.070
- Deja...
- Hey.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.504
(quietly): I got it.

36:12.751 --> 36:15.553
You know what I thought of, the
first time I heard your name?

36:16.543 --> 36:18.747
I thought of the expression "déjà vu."

36:19.055 --> 36:21.598
Because you remind me
a little of myself.

36:21.714 --> 36:22.778
When I was your age.

36:24.442 --> 36:25.702
KATE: <i>Can I ask you something?</i>

36:26.247 --> 36:27.247
Why now?

36:27.356 --> 36:29.793
Why did you suddenly try to find them?

36:31.747 --> 36:32.948
RANDALL: <i>These are my parents.</i>

36:33.411 --> 36:35.153
Jack and Rebecca.

36:37.133 --> 36:39.333
They adopted me the day I was born.

36:41.348 --> 36:42.817
This is my birth father.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.176
William.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.551
I met him for the first time last year.

36:48.203 --> 36:52.184
My whole childhood, I felt split inside.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.801
There are these people
that I lived with,

36:58.465 --> 37:00.973
and then there were my birth parents,
who I had never met.

37:01.675 --> 37:03.942
But I thought about them all the time.

37:05.778 --> 37:06.911
RANDALL: <i>It's like, a...</i>

37:07.389 --> 37:09.770
a-a ringing in my ears, and, uh...

37:11.333 --> 37:13.293
It quiets down sometimes, but...

37:14.036 --> 37:16.700
I-It can quiet down so much,
I almost forget it's there,

37:16.725 --> 37:19.122
but then, there are some times
where it's so loud,

37:20.208 --> 37:21.356
I just feel alone.

37:22.715 --> 37:24.870
But, I mean, that doesn't
have anything to do

37:24.895 --> 37:25.950
- with you guys.
- We know.

37:27.651 --> 37:28.651
It's okay.

37:34.229 --> 37:35.442
But here's the thing.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.012
My life turned out pretty great.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.583
And it's not just my big house,

37:43.608 --> 37:45.770
or my super-fine wife, all right?

37:46.188 --> 37:50.286
I've got this big,
amazing extended family.

37:51.722 --> 37:55.254
I've got this big,
amazing, beautiful life.

37:56.031 --> 37:58.231
And if I'm seeing me in you,

37:58.453 --> 38:02.450
if seeing you is giving me that
sweet, sweet déjà vu feeling,

38:02.935 --> 38:05.700
I think that means it's gonna
happen for you, too.

38:10.608 --> 38:11.653
Okay?

38:12.857 --> 38:13.965
Okay.

38:19.562 --> 38:20.731
RANDALL: Okay.

38:23.990 --> 38:24.990
Deja?

38:27.205 --> 38:29.481
Your mom might not be
coming back for a while.

38:32.697 --> 38:34.239
What do you mean? Yes, she will.

38:35.150 --> 38:36.208
No, this is what happens.

38:36.233 --> 38:38.551
She gets busted, she gets taken away,

38:38.576 --> 38:39.935
- then she comes back for me.
- I...

38:39.959 --> 38:41.911
I know that's how it usually happens,

38:42.416 --> 38:44.851
but since this time
was a lot more serious,

38:45.690 --> 38:47.622
she might be going to jail for a while.

38:54.285 --> 38:55.619
(glass shatters)

39:00.030 --> 39:01.497
It's okay. It's okay.
