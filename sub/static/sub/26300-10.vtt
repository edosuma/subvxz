00:00.960 --> 00:02.499
Previously on Star...

00:02.500 --> 00:04.059
One photo, and ICE could grab you.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.089
I'm here.

00:05.090 --> 00:06.240
Do you remember those, um,

00:06.250 --> 00:08.180
car rides that Daddy used to take me on?

00:08.189 --> 00:10.599
He used to do things to
me when we were alone.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.552
I may have Alzheimer's.

00:12.553 --> 00:13.669
See ya.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.222
Jackson,

00:16.224 --> 00:17.509
I didn't know.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.779
I'm not mad at you.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.811
I just thought he was gonna be my son.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.480
And I think I should move out.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.524
The festival is riding
on the closing act.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.740
Put me on the main stage.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.470
Okay? I'm ready.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.570
You don't want

00:30.580 --> 00:32.529
- to do this, Cassie.
- Oh, I'm doing it.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.040
I'm not your baby no more.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.560

on my son's head...

02:53.464 --> 02:57.092

evidence and keep his dirt low,

02:57.093 --> 02:59.280
he not gonna do nothing to Jayden or me.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.930
This is why I told your mama I
need to handle this by myself.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.219
What? No. I'm coming.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.320
- Cott, I don't know...
- That's my son!

03:07.340 --> 03:10.680
I'm coming. You-you...

03:14.200 --> 03:16.900

Noah?

03:43.260 --> 03:45.120
Noah?!

03:45.140 --> 03:47.440
Oh. Noah.

03:47.450 --> 03:49.369
I thought that was your car.

03:49.370 --> 03:51.329
Okay, okay, just-just relax.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.659
Are-are you all right?

03:52.660 --> 03:54.039
My back.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.210
Okay, okay, don't move. Don't move.

03:56.260 --> 03:58.239
Where's-where's my s... where's my son?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.629
Just... I'm gonna get you some help.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.289
My son. I was-I was trying
to get to the hospital.

04:02.290 --> 04:04.300
911. Yes, yes. I got a
accident. I need some help.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.800
It's a car accident.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.420
_

04:08.440 --> 04:10.360
Uh, we're on the side of the road,

04:10.370 --> 04:12.139
and it's a mile out
from Gravity Records.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.320
I need my family.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.199
Yo, chill, little man.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.728
We ain't gonna hurt you.

04:17.730 --> 04:20.420
This is just business, a'ight?

04:24.820 --> 04:26.300
Mama.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.320
It is so good to see you, babe.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.399
- Baby...
- Ah!

04:34.400 --> 04:36.119
Da-da-da-da.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.869
It's okay, Jay-Jay.

04:37.870 --> 04:40.419
We'll be out of here soon.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.980
You will?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.539
Where's my hard drive?

04:43.540 --> 04:44.800
Right here.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.479
Now, how do I know that you didn't

04:48.480 --> 04:50.549
download the evidence
on that drive, hmm?

04:50.550 --> 04:51.889
It's encrypted.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.100
Hmm.

04:53.110 --> 04:55.099
- On three.
- Yeah.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.770
- One.
- Two.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.940
Three.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.860
Our business is done. Period.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.640
You're right.

05:06.650 --> 05:09.090
I am done with you... and your club.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.279
I'm pulling my money from Karma.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.329
Well, until you come crawling
back, which you will.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.780
Oh!

05:17.800 --> 05:19.459
Bitch.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.099
- Bummer.
- Let me tell you something.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.209
Me and my club is gonna be good.

05:28.210 --> 05:31.759
You didn't make me, and you
damn sure ain't gonna break me.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.840
Got it?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.099
Go, Cott.

06:01.410 --> 06:06.080
I can't wait for you to
meet your... your grandson.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.620
Hey, look, Pop, uh, doc just walked in.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.050
Talk to you later.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.819
- Mr. Brooks.
- What's up, Doc?

06:12.820 --> 06:14.719
Well, that fracture you suffered

06:14.720 --> 06:16.780
in your back is gonna be a problem.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.889
I recommend a few more
days in the hospital,

06:18.890 --> 06:20.679
and then we'll put you
on some pain management.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.440
- Pain management? Like pills?
- Two OxyContin...

06:23.450 --> 06:26.580
No, Doc, I-I can't. Um, I'm an addict.

06:26.650 --> 06:30.420
So, uh, I can manage the pain myself.

06:30.460 --> 06:31.719
Understood.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.980
- Well, I suggest you rest your body.
- Here you go.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.199
All right. I'll check back
on my afternoon rounds.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.260
Thank you.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.359
Dr. Sanders to Hematology.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.659
Paging Dr. Sanders...

06:42.660 --> 06:44.419
He's up.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.999
My oxygen levels are up,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.749
so they're gonna let
us go home tomorrow.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.169
Oh, so little man's all
right. He's good to go.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.080
Yeah, he's got to learn to latch on,

06:54.100 --> 06:56.890
but other than that, he's
strong like his mama.

06:56.940 --> 06:59.240
Like his pop.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.309
What? I'm still trying
to get used to that.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.460
Me too.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.980
Nurse practitioner,

07:05.990 --> 07:08.439
call Admitting, 2773.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.460
Look, I know we didn't plan for him,

07:11.470 --> 07:14.110
but he's here now,

07:14.160 --> 07:17.040
and I love him more than
anything in the world.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.540
But I want him to have
the life he deserves.

07:20.550 --> 07:21.739
So, if you're not
ready, I want you to...

07:21.740 --> 07:23.830
Mm, I love him, too.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.249
I...

07:27.250 --> 07:29.749
I'm just trying to wrap my
head around all of this.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.589
Well, wrap your head around it fast,

07:32.590 --> 07:34.620
'cause we're his parents.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.930
We're all he's got.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.659
Yeah...

07:39.660 --> 07:41.300
I know you don't want
to be like your mom.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.389
I have the same thing with my pops.

07:45.390 --> 07:47.770
Just know that I'm here for Davis.

07:49.860 --> 07:53.229
Even though you named
him without asking me.

07:53.230 --> 07:56.029
I'm sorry. Have we met?

07:56.030 --> 07:59.240
'Cause you should be thanking me
for giving him your last name.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.159
Well, it worked out.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.640
My grandpa's name was Davis.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.859
Well, that was meant to be, huh?

08:06.860 --> 08:08.079
Yeah.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.460
It's a new year, so I think
everybody deserves a new start.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.639
Figure I'd start with a new car, right?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.580
- You got your settlement money.
- A little bit.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.179
Might as well spend some of it.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.960
Do you see anything you
like, Ms. Crane and... ?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.639
Derek. My name is Derek.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.219
Yeah, we're actually
here for him. Thanks.

08:24.220 --> 08:26.560
So... vanilla or chocolate?

08:26.640 --> 08:27.939
Excuse me?

08:27.940 --> 08:30.100
Did Star pick Noah or Jackson?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.550
Noah's hot as hell,

08:31.560 --> 08:34.359
but Jackson can have my
panties and my vows.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.109
Wow. I'm not answering that.

08:37.110 --> 08:38.989
We're gonna go look around ourselves.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.529
All right.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.400
I'll be around.

08:42.490 --> 08:43.828
What is wrong with people?

08:43.830 --> 08:46.060
Forget about Take 3 for a minute, okay?

08:46.070 --> 08:47.909
I want you to find what's next for you.

08:47.910 --> 08:49.789
It's always about me.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.360
What do you want?

08:52.440 --> 08:54.129
Just to get back to my community work.

08:54.130 --> 08:55.640
And you will.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.419
What's up?

08:59.420 --> 09:00.700
Take a seat, bro.

09:01.010 --> 09:03.599
So, the festival was a success.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.889
I just saw the streaming
numbers for Take 3's album.

09:05.890 --> 09:07.640
The album's getting some great reviews.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.320
Plus, Alex's single
just hit the Top 100.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.299
That's amazing. I'm sure
Carlotta has a plan

09:12.300 --> 09:13.580
to capitalize on the buzz.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.380
Yeah, well, I got something better.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.529
I just helped GiGi
release her new album.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.399
A little surprise for the fans.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.360
She's trending on every platform.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.369
♪ Run it up, body cold, frosty... ♪

09:24.370 --> 09:26.390
You dropped an album on Gravity Records

09:26.400 --> 09:27.539
without telling Carlotta?

09:27.540 --> 09:29.340
I needed you to take note.

09:29.350 --> 09:30.980
Plus, I wanted to prove to you

09:30.990 --> 09:33.439
that I deserve a more permanent
position here at Gravity.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.589
And with the right distribution deal,

09:35.590 --> 09:37.089
I can bring my indie label, Karma,

09:37.090 --> 09:38.980
and Noah Brooks to Gravity Records.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.660
Man.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.460
I appreciate the effort.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.379
This is Carlotta's label.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.840
You want the job, talk to her.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.949
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:03.950 --> 10:06.579
How's my grandson holding up?

10:06.580 --> 10:08.240
He didn't go to school again today.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.749
I can't believe I caused all of this.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.959
Jayden'll be all right.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.749
Xander's out of our lives.

10:14.750 --> 10:15.879
Yeah, for now.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.400
You cannot allow someone

10:17.420 --> 10:19.169
to have that much power over you.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.800
Take it back.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.559
Mama.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.340
What you doing here with him?

10:32.060 --> 10:34.189
Your daddy and I were worried.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.190
I'd like to meet my grandson.

10:36.780 --> 10:38.240
He needs family now.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.690
- Not on my watch.
- Or mine, either.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.820
You know, I-I'm tired of you
disrespecting me, okay?

10:43.140 --> 10:45.600
This is my house.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.990
What did I do to you?

10:50.020 --> 10:51.999
- What did you do to me?
- What?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.869
You come in my house asking
me what you did to me?

10:54.870 --> 10:56.160
Yes, I'm asking you.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.630
You raped me.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.000
What you talking about, girl?

11:03.080 --> 11:06.650
Look, I-I promise you, Chrissy,
I-I didn't touch this child.

11:06.660 --> 11:09.349
- Mama, he is lying.
- He's your father.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.769
- Stepfather.
- Stop this right now.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.139
Your daddy's sick,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.769
and what he needs will be his children

11:14.770 --> 11:17.149
and his grandchildren
to all come together.

11:17.150 --> 11:19.690
And we need to fix this damn family.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.449
Fix this damn family?

11:23.450 --> 11:26.740
Mama. He raped me.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.829
Oh, my God.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.030
Who's down there?

11:30.040 --> 11:31.220
I'm scared.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.780
Everything is okay, Jayden.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.439
Cotton, take him upstairs.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.839
It's all right.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.400
Um, come on, let's go
back in bed. Come on.

11:45.940 --> 11:48.810
You know what? You a liar, Lottie.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.360
Come on, Calvin.

12:02.410 --> 12:04.230
She don't believe me.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.660
I do.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.060
- Hey. So, look, so this the plan.
- No, no, no...

12:17.200 --> 12:20.399
Carlotta's gonna stay with
Star for this final checkup,

12:20.400 --> 12:21.589
so we need to get to work now.

12:21.590 --> 12:22.929
What are we getting started on?

12:22.930 --> 12:25.160
GiGi's drop killed all
the buzz on y'all album,

12:25.170 --> 12:27.019
so we got to get people
talking about Take 3 again.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.559
But people are talking about Take 3.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.569
No, they're talking about

12:29.570 --> 12:32.099
all the nasty sex Star
had on the Turn Up tour.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.319
Anyway, look, we got to get to work,

12:33.320 --> 12:34.329
'cause the last thing we need is

12:34.330 --> 12:36.540
for y'all to lose steam before the ASAs.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.609
- Wait, what?
- The ASAs?

12:38.610 --> 12:40.489
We're being considered for the ASAs?

12:40.490 --> 12:42.390
No, I'm just talking
to exercise my jaws,

12:42.400 --> 12:43.980
as if they need more exercising.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.039
Yeah.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.909
Something me and Carlotta
been working on for a while.

12:46.910 --> 12:50.120
Okay, you guys do realize we'd
have to campaign as a group?

12:50.140 --> 12:51.999
- Yeah.
- I just started gaining traction

12:52.000 --> 12:53.620
as a solo artist. Come on.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.670
Okay, we have been talking about
getting an ASA since we met.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.600
So, what's the plan?

12:59.610 --> 13:01.099
Thank you. We got to get

13:01.100 --> 13:02.839
attention off of GiGi and back on y'all.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.009
So, with this feature in
the Billboard ASA issue,

13:05.010 --> 13:07.679
we can really, really
impress Houston Connelly,

13:07.680 --> 13:10.320
the Anna Wintour of music.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.639
So, Gravity has a performance
slot at the Billboard's

13:12.640 --> 13:15.309
magazine party for the
who's who of the ASAs,

13:15.310 --> 13:17.520
and we got to get Take 3 on that stage.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.279
A push for the ASAs.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.199
Star ain't gon' believe this.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.279
Well, ain't nothing more
surprising than that cocoa baby

13:23.280 --> 13:24.409
that came out of her. But, look,

13:24.410 --> 13:25.719
I need y'all to get to work on this.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.909
You just don't have no babies,

13:26.910 --> 13:28.519
and you definitely don't have no babies.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.400
And don't record it if you do.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.459
Can't wait to tell her.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.060
It's Angel.

13:42.670 --> 13:44.560
Hey.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.049
What?

13:48.050 --> 13:50.280
Yeah, I got it.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.059
You had no right to move Angel.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.939
Let me call you back, man.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.840
Thanks.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.109
Simone, ICE was sniffing around.

14:01.110 --> 14:03.279
Somebody thought they saw
him at the festival.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.590
But he's fine. He's safe
as long as he's in a city

14:05.600 --> 14:08.620
where they passed temporary
sanctuary stay for immigrants.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.819
I moved him to Gainesville.

14:09.820 --> 14:11.289
- Florida?
- Yeah.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.709
Sometimes good things
actually happen there.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.260
It's up to U.S. cities
to push back on ICE

14:17.270 --> 14:19.959
to protect low-priority,
nonviolent immigrants

14:19.960 --> 14:21.799
from deportation.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.010
That's why I'm working
on my connections.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.679
I believe, with the right push,
maybe Atlanta's city council

14:27.680 --> 14:29.340
will make Atlanta a sanctuary city.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.889
How long will that take?

14:33.890 --> 14:35.389
Six months, maybe more.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.080
Where exactly is he?

14:37.150 --> 14:40.319
It's best you don't
know all the details.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.840
So I just got him back
and you sent him away.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.120
What if something happens
to him and I'm not there?

14:45.140 --> 14:47.640
- I can't do anything about it.
- You got to trust me.

14:47.660 --> 14:49.960
Why should I trust
your ass? Nina didn't.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.040
Unbelievable.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.419
Yo, yo.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.900
How you holding up, playa?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.020
Getting better every day.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.719
Hey. Look...

15:06.720 --> 15:08.639
I never thanked you for helping me.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.419
Man, I saw that car on the side
of the road, and I thought...

15:11.420 --> 15:13.009
That I was high and crashed, huh?

15:13.010 --> 15:14.499
I thought your demons finally won.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.689
Nah, I'll never let that happen.

15:20.370 --> 15:23.520
So, I hear you making big
moves over at Gravity.

15:23.610 --> 15:25.340
You got GiGi album coming out, right?

15:25.350 --> 15:27.380
I'm aiming for the head of A&R.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.699
Well, make sure you remember
your number-one artist.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.909
All right? I need to put this
album out before the ASAs.

15:32.910 --> 15:34.999
I've been out the game since the rehab,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.199
and I missed the festival, and now...

15:38.200 --> 15:40.789
Man, I-I got Davis to think about.

15:40.790 --> 15:42.460
Baby changes everything, man.

15:42.470 --> 15:43.499
I wish I had more time

15:43.500 --> 15:45.009
to prepare to be someone's father.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.669
Even if you had time,

15:46.670 --> 15:48.799
you can't prepare for a baby coming.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.929
Megan and I, we had to learn on the fly.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.680
Hey, Maurice, man,
I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't...

15:53.700 --> 15:55.469
- I didn't mean to...
- It's all right.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.979
Does Megan know about the baby?

15:56.980 --> 15:59.799
She needs time to process.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.859
She's away on business, and
I'm here handling mine.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.680
So, what you got for me?

16:04.770 --> 16:06.359
Well, Gravity's got a performance

16:06.360 --> 16:09.069
at the Billboard ASA party.

16:09.070 --> 16:12.069
What'd the doctor say
about you performing?

16:12.070 --> 16:14.560
Oh, man. He said I'm good.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.379
You know? Give me
that spot. Let's do it.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.500
- Done deal.
- Done deal.

16:19.870 --> 16:21.879
Might want to get
yourself some rest, man.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.740
Yeah.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.299
Well, speaking of good guys,

16:25.300 --> 16:26.839
you talk to Jackson?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.719
Nah, he won't return my calls.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.539
He just needs time.

16:30.540 --> 16:32.560
I mean, he said he had
you for a lifetime.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.259
That was before a lifetime

16:34.260 --> 16:35.480
included Noah.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.439
One second.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.689
All right, I got to go.

16:40.690 --> 16:43.609
This nurse is gonna teach me
how to get him latched on

16:43.610 --> 16:45.690
- before I get released tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.489
Here I come.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.740
Tell me what I got to do.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.990
Who are you?

16:58.720 --> 17:00.120
Get away from my son.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.289
Shh. He's so cute.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.819
Like a little Hershey's Kiss.

17:04.819 --> 17:06.459
Who knew someone like you

17:06.460 --> 17:09.089
could have such a perfect,
sweet, little baby?

17:09.089 --> 17:10.859
I said step back.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.878
So, you have everything now, don't you?

17:12.880 --> 17:14.638
A whole family.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.618
But, you see, I lost my
family because of you.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.499
Hunter, my nephew, is gone.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.799
Arlene, my sister, is dead.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.260
- I had nothing to do with it.
- No, you didn't.

17:24.270 --> 17:25.939
But your little short daddy did.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.398
He told me he killed my
sister when he died.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.440
So I thought I'd even the score.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.739
I looked him right into the eye...

17:33.740 --> 17:35.140
and I took his life.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.560
The goodbye phone call
at the end to you?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.960
Well, that was just the
damn cherry on top.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.060
Like I said, such a sweet, sweet baby.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.469
Somebody stop her!

17:52.470 --> 17:53.840
Stop!

17:55.240 --> 17:56.259
Stop!

17:56.260 --> 17:59.080
- Bitch!
- Hey! Hey!

17:59.820 --> 18:00.920
- Get off of me!
- Come on.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.060
This crazy bitch attacked me!

18:03.070 --> 18:05.439
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Call the police!

18:05.440 --> 18:07.560
- I want her in jail!
- Get off of me!

18:07.580 --> 18:09.189
Oh, my God.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.529
- What is going on?
- Noah. Calm down.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.199
I'm Courtney.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.749
I'm the CPS worker handling your case.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.140
- My case?
- We had to take custody of the child.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.039
- Wait, why?
- Because of your addiction issues

18:29.040 --> 18:31.129
- and the mother's recent charges.
- Wait, I...

18:31.130 --> 18:33.469
Unfortunately, Mr.
Brooks, your blood work

18:33.470 --> 18:36.040
from the night of your accident
came back inconclusive.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.929
Well, then you got the wrong
test results, all right?

18:37.930 --> 18:39.849
Uh, 'cause I haven't
done nothing in months.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.539
Miss C, I promise. You
got to believe me.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.640
- I...
- Run the tests again.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.889
We are. We'll be in touch.

18:45.890 --> 18:49.400
Until then, our priority
is Davis' safety.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.840
He'll remain with us.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.900
Well, why can't he remain with me?

18:53.990 --> 18:55.760
You can't take this baby.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.240
We will fix this.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.740
Okay?

19:06.870 --> 19:09.920
Mm. What's going on, babe?

19:09.960 --> 19:12.300
CPS won't give Davis to Noah.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.660
Something about his tox report.

19:14.700 --> 19:18.340
I can't tell Star that her son's
gonna get put in the system.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.599
You know, we been through that,
and that would kill her.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.899
Look, we going to that courthouse

19:23.900 --> 19:26.800
and we gonna post bail, and
that baby coming home.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.649
Okay?

19:28.650 --> 19:30.260
Yeah.

19:30.810 --> 19:33.440
I mean...

19:33.460 --> 19:34.860
she'll get bail, right?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.960
Girl.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.480
This is still America, and
she is still a white woman.

19:39.540 --> 19:44.319
Listen, Star is strong, and she's smart.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.699
She can handle this.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.099
Yeah. You know, she gonna make bail,

19:48.100 --> 19:49.709
and then, by this time next week,

19:49.710 --> 19:51.639
she gonna have Davis, and
then we're gonna kill

19:51.640 --> 19:53.589
that Billboard party.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.379
So, Billboard don't want the
performance from Take 3.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.549
They said the arrest is too recent.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.880
Yeah, so Star's got... nothing, then?

20:03.930 --> 20:05.310
Listen, come here.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.040
Star got a gang of people that love her.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.149
Okay?

20:12.150 --> 20:14.320
We just got to fix one
problem at a time.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.579
How do you feel about Star
Davis not making bail?

20:25.580 --> 20:27.800
Happy.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.160
I just wanted to visit her,

20:29.170 --> 20:31.959
and she viciously attacked
me without provocation.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.539
I'll be able to sleep better at night

20:33.540 --> 20:35.799
- knowing that she's locked up behind...
- You're a liar!

20:35.800 --> 20:38.299
My sister's locked up
because of your lies!

20:38.300 --> 20:40.839
- You know what you did!
- No more questions.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.500
So, what's going on
with Noah and Jackson?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.559
You're the guy from the sex tape.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.639
- What's it like being Mr. Crane?
- Excuse me.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.099
Why weren't you in there?

20:51.100 --> 20:54.039
Star needs everybody that loves
her by her side right now.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.269
What happened in there?

20:55.270 --> 20:57.819
No bail. Charlene's
family's got connections,

20:57.820 --> 20:59.609
and now Davis is with CPS.

20:59.610 --> 21:01.699
What? What are you talking about?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.619
- What about Noah?
- They're running some tests.

21:03.620 --> 21:05.140
There's something about his tox report.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.119
Look, we're gonna get Davis back.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.829
- I know that you're worried, but...
- I have to go.

21:08.830 --> 21:11.260
Hey, don't stay away, okay?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.119
Star can't handle losing someone else.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.140
Sometimes blood ain't got
nothing to do with family.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.009
How's Star?

21:27.010 --> 21:28.809
A hot mess.

21:28.810 --> 21:31.720
They won't give her bail.
Sh-She's still in custody.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.099
- Yeah.
- Thank you for watching Jayden.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.479
Oh, yeah, that's the least I can do.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.730
- Let me help you out.
- Yeah.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.949
So much is going on.

21:41.950 --> 21:43.949
It's crazy.

21:43.950 --> 21:47.409
Hunter family keep popping
up like a bad rash.

21:47.410 --> 21:49.449
Ain't nothing worse than to
think you done with something

21:49.450 --> 21:52.119
only for it to beat your ass
when you ain't looking.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.079
- Yeah.
- Damn, look at your mama.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.260
I'm so hurt that she had to
carry that all on her own.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.499
And then for Nana not to believe her.

21:59.500 --> 22:03.340
See, your nana, she always
been blinded by him.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.349
I keep thinking about
that summer when...

22:07.350 --> 22:09.969
Daddy was gonna take
Carlotta to Jacksonville.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.779
And I tried to get in the car,

22:11.780 --> 22:13.840
'cause you know I needed
my daddy time, too.

22:13.980 --> 22:16.399
- Yeah.
- This bitch drags

22:16.400 --> 22:18.979
my dumb ass out of the
backseat of that car

22:18.980 --> 22:21.560
and was gonna beat me up till I bled.

22:22.560 --> 22:25.240
I guess that was her way of
making sure I didn't go.

22:26.460 --> 22:29.029
- I'm so sorry, Ti.
- Yeah.

22:29.030 --> 22:31.439
See, that's why we got to stop being mad

22:31.440 --> 22:32.919
and just be there for her.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.659
Nuh-uh. I'm mad.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.579
I'm a whole lot of mad.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.899
Please don't do nothing crazy.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.210
I ain't gonna kill him.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.660
Today.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.420
Ain't none of this my fault, all right?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.900
Your sister popped off
and now she's in jail,

22:50.960 --> 22:52.169
and Davis ain't with us.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.969
Well, this ain't Star's fault.

22:53.970 --> 22:57.050
Okay, Davis would be here if
your tox report wasn't dirty.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.879
When we get him back,

22:59.880 --> 23:01.719
we need to figure out
where he's gonna go.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.979
A-Ain't nothing to talk about.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.979
All right? My son will be with me.

23:06.980 --> 23:10.069
You can visit, but he lives with me.

23:10.070 --> 23:12.739
Look...

23:12.740 --> 23:16.909
Simone, you can't let your
issues with me affect Davis.

23:16.910 --> 23:18.409
All right?

23:18.410 --> 23:20.079
He's most important.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.199
I know.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.840
Mr. Brooks, the tox
report came back clean.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.100
Like I told you.

23:27.110 --> 23:29.089
We're not trying to
keep you from your son.

23:29.090 --> 23:30.519
Sorry for the delay.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.800
We just wanted to make
sure Davis was safe.

23:36.380 --> 23:37.620
Hey.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.640
My son will always be safe with me.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.059
You can go.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.560
Hey.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.359
Why don't we both stay at
Star's and look after him?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.359
You couldn't keep me away.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.860
Daddy's here.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.080
You'll always be safe with me.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.720
Dad.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.880
Dad.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.560
Hey, baby.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.429
Come on in.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.559
Sit on down. Talk to your daddy.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.770
Sit on down.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.780
Talk to me.

24:39.420 --> 24:42.159
What happened to Lottie

24:42.160 --> 24:44.640
when you took her on
those fishing trips?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.289
We'd fish.

24:49.290 --> 24:51.289
I love trout.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.089
You love trout?

24:53.090 --> 24:55.519
Your mama love when I
fry up some fish...

24:55.520 --> 24:57.879
- Focus, fool!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.480
Don't you raise your voice at me.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.420
This here my house.

25:01.590 --> 25:04.499
You and that evil inside
you better calm on down.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.750
You gonna get yourself in trouble.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.660
Now, where's my brother Alvin?

25:07.670 --> 25:10.519
You know, Alvin loves
when I cook up some fish.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.860
Alvin's been dead, Dad.

25:13.540 --> 25:14.960
Dead?

25:15.940 --> 25:17.899
What did you do to my sister?

25:17.900 --> 25:20.319
You working yourself up for
an ass whipping right now.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.700
Dead.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.740
You hurt my sister.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.829
And you made me hate her
for most of my life.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.289
Say you did it.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.289
- Did-did what? Did what?
- Say you did it.

25:35.290 --> 25:39.169
Say it or I'm gonna blow your
brains out all over this house.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.010
Say it.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.540
Please.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.600
You never felt on me.

25:50.020 --> 25:52.899
But I feel just as dirty as Carlotta did

25:52.900 --> 25:55.400
with your blood running
through my veins.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.359
I...

25:59.360 --> 26:03.290
You turned me into a
monster, just like you,

26:03.300 --> 26:05.320
and I hate you for...

26:05.330 --> 26:07.560
I hate you for that.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.209
Baby, b-baby.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.920
Baby, w-wait a minute.

26:19.020 --> 26:20.250
Please sit down.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.750
Don't-don't... don't go.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.039
Please, please!

26:23.040 --> 26:24.980
C-Cassie!

26:30.160 --> 26:32.639
Damn, you got some lungs on you.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.379
When you get older, I'll show
you how to use 'em, all right?

26:35.380 --> 26:36.940
- 'Sup?
- Huh?

26:37.920 --> 26:39.320
What's up?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.029
Nothing.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.399
I just, uh, came by to check on him.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.489
We good. Just trying to tell him

26:45.490 --> 26:47.329
I got to get ready for this performance,

26:47.330 --> 26:49.620
but he ain't trying to hear it. Huh?

26:49.700 --> 26:52.739
So, I heard CPS had
some questions for you.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.749
You need to be very careful
of what you about to ask me.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.749
I spent the past six months

26:57.750 --> 26:59.960
preparing to be the man
that Star needed...

27:00.820 --> 27:03.720
... and the father that Davis deserves.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.799
So I'm asking...

27:06.800 --> 27:08.480
are you clean?

27:08.500 --> 27:10.389
I got you. Shh.

27:10.390 --> 27:13.769
Look, I know you're having
a hard time with all this.

27:13.770 --> 27:15.540
You feel like you lost something.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.080
- That's 'cause I did.
- But you didn't.

27:18.190 --> 27:21.220
This is my son. My blood.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.040
I love him, and I love Star.

27:23.050 --> 27:24.949
I ain't trying to get in the
way of what you got with Star.

27:24.950 --> 27:26.560
But what I'm not about to do

27:26.570 --> 27:28.620
is keep apologizing
for Davis being mine.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.780
I love my son.

- You got it.
- Really?

27:59.280 --> 28:01.000
Yeah. You know how to skate?

28:01.070 --> 28:03.189
No, girl. I was in foster care.

28:03.190 --> 28:05.840
So, Houston Connelly should be in VIP.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.529
Now, I don't know where that is, but...

28:07.530 --> 28:09.819
That's cool. We need to let her know

28:09.820 --> 28:12.539
it's mad disrespectful that
she didn't let us perform.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.159
And that we deserve to be
in that Billboard issue.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.079
I hear you. I just don't think

28:17.080 --> 28:18.579
it's best to run up on her like that.

28:18.580 --> 28:20.209
Alex, we got to.

28:20.210 --> 28:23.919
I can't let the ball drop now
that Star's locked up, you know?

28:23.920 --> 28:26.019
By this time next year,
we're gonna have an ASA,

28:26.020 --> 28:27.719
and we're gonna be on
that Billboard cover.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.179
- Here you go.
- Mark my words.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.219
- Thank you.
- Okay.

28:30.220 --> 28:31.940
Thanks.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.499
Oh, there she is.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.960

28:44.230 --> 28:45.529
Uh, my name's Simone Davis.

28:45.530 --> 28:47.919
This is Alex Crane, and
we're from Take 3...

28:47.920 --> 28:50.199
Alex, a pleasure.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.659
Loved your performance
at Rhythm & Bells.

28:52.660 --> 28:55.829
Thank you. We're actually
here for Take 3 though.

28:55.830 --> 28:58.250
We just dropped our Scarlet
Impala album, and...

28:58.260 --> 29:00.079
And when is your solo album dropping?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.499
I'm not sure yet.

29:02.500 --> 29:06.319
But Take 3's album, between
the numbers and the love

29:06.320 --> 29:07.969
that the critics have been showing us,

29:07.970 --> 29:10.629
Take 3 is perfect for
your Billboard ASA issue.

29:10.630 --> 29:13.719
For most people, Take 3
is a lucky girls group

29:13.720 --> 29:15.780
that won a local competition.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.929
We want to put real
artists on the cover.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.179
Real artists?

29:19.180 --> 29:21.799
Not talent show winners. No disrespect.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.540
We get real love from our fans.

29:24.550 --> 29:25.599
They love your stunts...

29:25.600 --> 29:28.460
the fighting, the running
after your illegal husband,

29:28.470 --> 29:30.279
and now this mess with Star.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.779
I'm sorry.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.160
Take 3 is not right for the issue.

29:34.170 --> 29:35.979
Mm, I understand that.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.949
You know, we're not perfect.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.999
We make mistakes, pick ourselves
up, put it in the music.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.959
You know, and sometimes
it gets into the blogs

29:42.960 --> 29:45.639
or whatever, but if you base
your decision off of that,

29:45.640 --> 29:47.470
then obviously you don't
know what it's like

29:47.480 --> 29:49.419
to have a real artist
in front of your face.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.859
And the last thing I want to say is

29:50.860 --> 29:52.799
keep my sister's name
out your damn mouth,

29:52.800 --> 29:53.969
along with my husband,

29:53.970 --> 29:55.560
or else there's gonna be a fist in it.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.890
Have a wonderful night.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.059
I'm sorry.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.760
Hey, watch out.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.480
How you holding up?

30:22.460 --> 30:24.459
Thank you.

30:24.460 --> 30:25.579
Bobby send you?

30:25.580 --> 30:27.999
He did, but we were both concerned.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.129
Your whole life changed on a dime.

30:30.130 --> 30:33.629
I know I lost it when that baby
came out like a Tootsie Roll.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.720
So I know you going through it.

30:37.860 --> 30:40.219
I don't think I can do it.

30:40.220 --> 30:41.929
I'm just getting sober.

30:41.930 --> 30:43.419
My career's crazy.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.770
My back is jacked.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.020
Star's in jail.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.899
And he needs so much.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.109
I don't want to fail him.

30:53.110 --> 30:55.279
That's not gonna happen.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.240
You been the comeback
kid since I met you.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.750
I ain't no father, but I got

30:59.760 --> 31:01.499
something I had to fight
like hell to protect,

31:01.500 --> 31:04.829
even when I ain't know
if I was strong enough.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.419
Running around in a tutu

31:06.420 --> 31:07.860
when I was a young'un, I made a promise

31:07.880 --> 31:09.339
to that little boy in me

31:09.340 --> 31:11.680
that I moved hell or high water to keep.

31:13.180 --> 31:15.840
Do that for Davis.

31:15.890 --> 31:18.820
Make that your North Star...

31:18.850 --> 31:20.849
and you'll be all right.

31:20.850 --> 31:22.579
Billboard hopes everyone

31:22.580 --> 31:24.059
is having a ball tonight.

31:24.060 --> 31:26.610
Get ready for a performance
by the one and only

31:26.620 --> 31:29.440
Noah Brooks.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.760
Yo, I know everybody's
been asking about my son

31:37.820 --> 31:39.869
and how it feels to be a father now.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.749

Let's give it up for Noah Brooks!

33:30.660 --> 33:33.399
Hey, fatherhood looks good on you.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.569
- Congratulations.
- Man, it's been a hell of a week.

33:36.570 --> 33:38.989
I ain't expect for this
to happen so soon.

33:38.990 --> 33:40.739
Not like this.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.199
I'm sure he keeps you up all night.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.199
Oh, man, two tours, 48 cities,

33:44.200 --> 33:46.250
and I-I still didn't know
I could be this tired.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.660
You know, my dad always told me,

33:47.670 --> 33:48.760
"Do what's hard while it's easy,"

33:48.770 --> 33:49.770
- you know?
- Yeah.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.170
Word. You know what I
mean? We young, healthy.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.419
We can afford to stay
up late, get up early,

33:54.420 --> 33:57.759
face our fears and start all over again.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.240
We decide what kind
of men we want to be.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.549
I got you.

34:02.550 --> 34:05.219
That's real. I like that.

34:05.220 --> 34:07.849
Hey, look, man, I got to...
I got to go feed him, so...

34:07.850 --> 34:09.739
- You got duties, man.
- Yeah.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.320
- Hey, stay up.
- Take care, bro.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.579
Look, if we're not gonna
do this Billboard issue,

34:13.580 --> 34:14.799
then we need to do something else

34:14.800 --> 34:16.319
to impress Houston Connelly.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.518
Like what, Simone?

34:17.520 --> 34:20.360
Maybe we should remix a
top hit. Like Madonna.

34:20.370 --> 34:21.699
Recut the music video.

34:21.699 --> 34:23.179
We need to give her everything she needs

34:23.199 --> 34:24.949
so she can see what's
right in front of her.

34:24.949 --> 34:26.369
You sound like your sister.

34:26.370 --> 34:28.199
Good.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.958
I was told I'd find you in here.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.620
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.170
Um...

34:38.280 --> 34:39.918
Hello, Miss Connelly.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.719
I would like to apologize
for the other night.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.600
You know, I was really upset
about my sister, and...

34:47.600 --> 34:49.809
I still stand by what I
said about the music.

34:49.810 --> 34:51.929
And I stand by what I said, too.

34:51.929 --> 34:55.139
It would take a lot for
Take 3 to win an ASA.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.520
But Alex Crane is a different story.

34:58.570 --> 35:00.279
We'd like to put you in the issue.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.060
Wait. W-Why not Take 3?

35:04.070 --> 35:06.669
You have the name, the
story of surviving.

35:06.670 --> 35:09.330
You're the one with a real
shot at winning this year,

35:09.340 --> 35:10.360
not Take 3.

35:10.370 --> 35:13.049
You'll be part of our
"One's To Watch" piece.

35:13.050 --> 35:16.049
We're shooting a class photo
of the artists for the cover.

35:16.050 --> 35:18.760
I'll need an answer... soon.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.770
Simone.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.340
I don't have no time for no mess, Cas.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.330
I've been juggling things
with Star's lawyer

35:47.340 --> 35:49.459
and I cannot drop the
ball on this last push

35:49.460 --> 35:50.879
for the ASAs for the girls.

35:50.880 --> 35:54.200
Look, you gave that to me when
you didn't think you needed it.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.990
I can't have you walking
around unprotected, Carlotta,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.179
not with Xander out there,

35:58.180 --> 36:00.509
and not with Daddy showing
up to see Jayden.

36:00.510 --> 36:02.549
I don't need no piece to handle Calvin.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.440
He don't scare me no more.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.729
You know, I went to see his lying ass.

36:06.730 --> 36:09.640
And I put the nose of my
gun down his damn mouth,

36:09.650 --> 36:12.920
and I swear to God...
I wanted to kill him.

36:12.980 --> 36:17.020
It's like I needed him to
admit what he had done.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.100
And Mama... she needs to know.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.800
Mama knows, Cas.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.320
She has to.

36:29.380 --> 36:31.539
I wish I had proof.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.400
I have proof.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.780
I got pregnant when I was 14.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.889
Mama thought it was Jimmy's
from down the block.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.740
But Jimmy ain't never touch me.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.880
It was Calvin's.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.939
Wait. So you had a-a baby?

36:51.940 --> 36:54.769
It died shortly after it was born.

36:54.770 --> 36:56.279
Calvin took me down

36:56.280 --> 36:58.700
to Aunt Minnie's in
Jacksonville to have it.

36:58.740 --> 37:01.240
Mama knew.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.839
But she won't admit it,
'cause then she might

37:02.840 --> 37:04.740
have to deal with too much pain.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.900
What about your pain?

37:10.320 --> 37:14.290
Every day, I make a choice

37:14.360 --> 37:16.940
to put one foot in front of the other.

37:17.050 --> 37:20.440
And it's hard, but I make it.

37:20.510 --> 37:23.900
So you can take that
out of here with you.

37:24.050 --> 37:26.040
I'll let you know if I need it.

37:32.770 --> 37:34.300
I love you, sis.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.600
Alex, I just wanted to say I'm sorry

37:51.620 --> 37:53.169
for storming out like that.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.629
You don't have to say sorry.

37:55.630 --> 37:59.420
You have a lot going
on... Star and Angel.

37:59.460 --> 38:02.169
Everybody I love needs help, and I...

38:02.170 --> 38:03.940
I just feel like I can't fix nothing.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.340
You fix things all the time, Simone.

38:06.470 --> 38:10.180
Look, don't do what
anyone else would do.

38:10.310 --> 38:11.960
Do what Simone would do.

38:13.140 --> 38:15.060
And you're doing that Billboard issue.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.580
I'm just gonna miss us, that's all.

A free woman.

39:04.570 --> 39:05.940
Thank you, Derek.

39:06.700 --> 39:10.329
You know, Karma was supposed
to be about me going legit,

39:10.330 --> 39:11.619
but a bitch got distracted

39:11.620 --> 39:13.320
by all the labels they
was putting on me.

39:13.330 --> 39:15.540
Yeah, I know about that.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.420
Also know about you running
drugs out the club.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.959
How the hell you know that?

39:20.960 --> 39:22.839
Been doing some work with the cops.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.629
- So you the snitch?
- Hey, look, nothing like that.

39:25.630 --> 39:28.089
I just made a deal with
the cops because...

39:28.090 --> 39:30.709
one of the Bankhead Crew
boys attacked my grandma.

39:30.710 --> 39:31.719
Attacked?

39:31.720 --> 39:33.559
I had to do something.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.309
I wasn't just gonna stand by.

39:35.310 --> 39:37.599
I'm sick of standing by.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.240
Look, Karma is the
hottest club in the A.

39:40.250 --> 39:42.769
I just came up on some
stack from my settlement,

39:42.770 --> 39:45.360
and I'm looking to invest.

39:45.370 --> 39:47.899
So you're trying to go
into business with me?

39:47.900 --> 39:49.409
Knowing what you know?

39:49.410 --> 39:52.899
I want to get back to my
roots, invest in my community.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.420
Use the platform to actually
reach people in different ways.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.160
I decide the kind of man I want to be.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.060
You down?

40:01.080 --> 40:02.520
I'm open to it.

40:02.590 --> 40:05.350
But, yo, I got to give you mad props

40:05.380 --> 40:06.919
for keeping it all the way real with me,

40:06.920 --> 40:09.100
'cause you know I stay strapped.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.460
Well, I ain't no punk.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.880
Miss Ruby raised me right.

40:13.970 --> 40:15.260
All right.

40:17.860 --> 40:20.520
You said you'd help with
Angel, not take over.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.690
Simone.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.919
I am helping.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.909
Okay, well, I think that
I should put out a song.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.909
Get people talking about
it, and hopefully

40:35.910 --> 40:37.699
the buzz will get the
vote passed faster.

40:37.700 --> 40:41.669
Well, I think making a big
PR stunt could backfire.

40:41.670 --> 40:44.420
Oh, so we're just supposed
to work in the shadows?

40:48.720 --> 40:50.969
Listen to me.

40:50.970 --> 40:55.199
Growing up in Cuba, my
family didn't agree

40:55.200 --> 40:57.279
with everything the
new regime was doing.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.139
So my father did everything
he could to get me

40:59.140 --> 41:00.939
and my siblings out of Cuba safely,

41:00.940 --> 41:02.939
and you know how he did it?

41:02.940 --> 41:04.720
Behind closed doors.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.780
Everything done in the dark
isn't always about being shady.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.780
It's about keeping your loved ones safe.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.449
So I'm just supposed to sit here

41:17.450 --> 41:19.320
and wait for you to do something?

41:19.370 --> 41:22.500
I'm afraid you don't
have any other choice.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.929
- Dr. Henderson.
- Noah.

41:31.930 --> 41:34.680
- Thanks for coming by.
- Good to see you.

41:37.180 --> 41:39.019
You're not looking so good.

41:39.020 --> 41:41.519
You think?

41:41.520 --> 41:43.189
Is this what you're using for the pain?

41:43.190 --> 41:45.149
That's like putting a
Band-Aid on a bullet wound.

41:45.150 --> 41:46.859
What happened to what I prescribed you?

41:46.860 --> 41:48.180
I didn't think I needed them,

41:48.200 --> 41:52.069
but I got my son full-time
and I had a show.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.299
Ah. You didn't tell me you
were performing again.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.029
I know, I know, I know.

41:56.030 --> 41:59.730
Well, your performance likely
caused the back to spasm,

41:59.740 --> 42:02.409
but, uh, these painkillers
will take care of that.

42:02.410 --> 42:04.289
Uh, Doc, I told you,
I'm not taking those.

42:04.290 --> 42:05.579
I'm still in recovery.

42:05.580 --> 42:08.280
