<i>Do you ever wonder how long</i>
<i>it takes to change your life?</i>

00:18.985 --> 00:22.250
<i>What measure of time</i>
<i>is enough to be life-altering?</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.349
<i>Is it four years, like high school?</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:31.153
<i>One year? An eight-week rock tour?</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:38.000
<i>Can your life change in a month</i>
<i>or a week or a single day?</i>

00:40.106 --> 00:42.006
<i>We're always in a hurry,</i>

00:42.075 --> 00:45.533
<i>to grow up, to go places, to get ahead.</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:49.741
<i>But when you're young</i>

00:49.816 --> 00:53.183
<i>One hour can change everything.</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.492
How we doing this morning, seniors?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.051
Anyone wake up with their clothes on
from the night before,

01:03.129 --> 01:05.689
still drunk but strangely hung-over?

01:06.933 --> 01:08.161
Anyone?

01:09.669 --> 01:12.001
Well, I guess that was just me.

01:12.939 --> 01:18.741
Actually, last night was UNO night
at my house and it was a bloodbath,

01:18.812 --> 01:21.906
but I care not to discuss it
with you right now.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.471
So, we won't.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.409
But let me ask you guys a question.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.423
Does today's class really matter?

01:32.826 --> 01:36.592
Or is it just a 50-minute requirement
designed to get you a grade

01:36.663 --> 01:41.066
so you can go on to college or a job
and the rest of your lives? Anyone?

01:41.668 --> 01:46.162
If we say yes, can we have the grade
and go on to the rest of our lives?

01:49.442 --> 01:53.071
Mouth, using one word,
describe how your classmates see you.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.044
Awesome.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.686
Really? Okay.

02:01.988 --> 02:06.618
Let's say there are five universal terms
that describe everyone in high school.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.558
Okay, let's say, jock,

02:09.562 --> 02:12.224
prom queen,

02:16.636 --> 02:17.796
geek,

02:21.141 --> 02:24.577
loner, and?

02:25.378 --> 02:26.504
Slut?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.947
Okay, considering that "awesome"
isn't a category,

02:37.023 --> 02:39.821
Shelly Simon,
describe Mouth in one word.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.262
I don't really know him,

02:45.064 --> 02:47.089
but, "nice," I guess.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.659
Nice. I suppose we could file "nice"
under "friendly,"

02:50.737 --> 02:52.136
but since "friendly"
doesn't mean "friendly,"

02:52.205 --> 02:53.968
that would make Mouth a slut.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.167
You have four other choices.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.008
- Geek, I guess.
- Geek.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.511
Join the club, Mouth.

03:05.585 --> 03:08.884
Okay, class. Nathan, five choices.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.047
Jock.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.954
- Lucas.
- Jock.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.890
- Brooke.
- Prom queen.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.428
- Rachel.
- Friendly!

03:16.496 --> 03:17.520
Hey.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.827
- Peyton.
- Prom queen.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.491
Oh, come on. I am so a loner.

03:21.568 --> 03:25.060
Right. A loner cheerleader
who's dating a jock.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.801
No offense, but I'm a loner.
You're a prom queen.

03:28.875 --> 03:33.437
Like it or not,
you are who your classmates see you as.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.037
But here's the good news.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.741
That's gonna change soon.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.252
Because pretty soon, you're going to be
going into the big wide world

03:40.320 --> 03:45.587
and you can erase all those labels.

03:46.492 --> 03:51.122
Now, for some of you, shedding this image
is gonna be a great thing.

03:51.197 --> 03:54.792
And for some of you,
not such a great thing.

03:54.867 --> 03:58.769
But what matters
is that you know who you really are,

03:59.439 --> 04:02.533
and you know
how you want the world to see you.

04:02.609 --> 04:06.010
Now, you've all been together
for what? For four years?

04:06.613 --> 04:09.946
Haley, what's Lucas' middle name?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.845
Eugene.

04:12.518 --> 04:16.386
I'm sorry. I'm so... I'm sorry.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.856
Lucas, what's Glenda's last name?

04:21.127 --> 04:23.618
I... I don't know.

04:25.498 --> 04:26.658
Sorry.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.365
Okay, everyone on this side of the room,

04:29.435 --> 04:31.062
I want you to write your name
on a piece of paper

04:31.137 --> 04:34.004
and put it in Nathan's hat, okay? Hurry up.

04:34.073 --> 04:37.839
Everyone on this side of the room
is going to draw a name,

04:37.910 --> 04:40.276
and the name that you draw

04:40.346 --> 04:44.442
will be the person that you will spend
the rest of the class with.

04:45.885 --> 04:49.719
Maybe we'll find out
if 50 minutes can matter.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.716
Okay, pass the hat around.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.127
Shelly, who you got?

05:02.335 --> 05:03.529
Mouth.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.965
Karma's a funny thing, isn't it?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.906
- Haley?
- Skillsington.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.705
- Rachel?
- Bevin.

05:12.512 --> 05:16.608
- Glenda?
- Gotta love karma. Lucas.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.983
- Laura?
- Oh, I have Naria.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.613
- Emma?
- I've got Zack.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.853
- Michael?
- I got Fedig.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.291
Brooke?

05:29.595 --> 05:31.085
I have Chase.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.726
Peyton?

05:38.671 --> 05:39.763
Nathan.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.500
Okay, here's the deal. Everyone pair up.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.804
You can leave the classroom,
but not the campus.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.434
At the door, you'll find a camera.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.709
I want each of you, at the end of the class,
to take a picture of your partner.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.945
This picture represents how you see them.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.785
That picture is going into the yearbook
for the rest of time.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.820
Now, for some of you,
this is an opportunity

05:59.892 --> 06:02.486
to reinvent yourselves starting today.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.731
Do we have to reinvent ourselves?

06:05.798 --> 06:09.097
'Cause I think
most of my friends see me as fabulous.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.235
Maybe so.

06:11.304 --> 06:15.070
But my friend Mr. Miller sees you
as the girl who's failing calculus.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.538
Okay, everyone,
grab a camera and get out of here.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.478
Oh, and one more thing.
With the camera is a list of instructions.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.710
At the end of class, I want you to tell
me what you learned about your partner.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.843
You have 50 minutes. Go.

06:37.263 --> 06:40.027
Well, I guess you're stuck with the geek.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.033
Okay, okay, Haley J. S.,
let me make a deal with you.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.797
As long as you don't give birth early,
we good.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.361
I don't get it.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.132
- I'm Lucas.
- Scott, right?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.301
At least I know your last name.

06:51.377 --> 06:52.674
This is kind of like the Boy Toy auction,

06:52.745 --> 06:54.474
one without the kissing
and the partial nudity.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.811
The hour is still young.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.510
So, about this whole calculus thing...

07:07.794 --> 07:09.022
Glenda!

07:09.362 --> 07:10.590
Glenda!

07:12.398 --> 07:15.128
I'm sorry about not knowing your name.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.533
Could we just do the assignment?

07:19.739 --> 07:20.933
All right, look, first thing on the list.

07:21.007 --> 07:24.841
It's, "Share something personal
with your partner."

07:26.312 --> 07:29.008
Farrell. My last name's Farrell.

07:29.081 --> 07:31.447
Is that personal enough for you?

07:38.191 --> 07:40.091
Will you just listen to me, please?

07:40.159 --> 07:43.060
So, what? You accidentally forgot to
tell me that you were failing calculus

07:43.129 --> 07:45.927
when you started tutoring me in calculus?

07:46.499 --> 07:49.229
How'd you get that A
I saw on your test, anyways?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.294
- It's complicated. Trust me.
- Trust you?

07:53.172 --> 07:54.867
I already did that and now I find out

07:54.941 --> 07:58.536
that my tutor is doing worse
in calculus than I am.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.846
- It's a long story, okay?
- Well, don't tell me another story, Brooke.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.579
Tell me the truth.
Or is that even possible for you to do?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.583
Okay.

08:13.726 --> 08:14.988
Come on.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.159
You know,
you shouldn't judge people like that.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.097
You called me a geek.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.898
It was the only category that fit.
I called you nice first.

08:24.971 --> 08:28.407
Well, how do you know I'm nice?
Maybe I'm not nice.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.873
I see that.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.803
We're supposed to tell each other
something personal.

08:35.881 --> 08:40.284
Like, my middle name's Leonardo
after my grandpa Leo.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.550
I guess that's kind of geeky.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.423
Wow, you really got personal there.

08:48.928 --> 08:52.420
Well, it's not like you're gonna
tell me anything real either, right?

08:52.498 --> 08:54.489
It's just an assignment.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.401
Before I started Clean Teens,

09:02.742 --> 09:07.338
I was in a serious relationship
with this guy I met at summer camp.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.813
It was pretty intense and then

09:11.083 --> 09:14.075
we couldn't see each other
for the rest of the summer.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.987
My parents, they wouldn't
let me talk to him or anything.

09:20.593 --> 09:24.427
But I knew I'd see him
when we got back to school in the fall.

09:25.498 --> 09:29.525
And the night before we got back,
I couldn't sleep.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.946
This is the spot I was standing in
when I finally saw him again

09:42.448 --> 09:44.473
with his new girlfriend.

09:45.885 --> 09:49.480
He looked at me, you know?
He looked right at me,

09:49.555 --> 09:52.547
and then he just walked away
without a word.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.288
It was just over.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.533
That's the moment
I thought of Clean Teens.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.770
But, like you said, it's not like
I'm actually gonna tell you anything real.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.413
Okay, pregnant girl on the roof.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.552
Come on now, man, we had a deal.
No early deliveries.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.614
All right.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.057
Now, check it out
you're gonna love this view.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.186
It's the shiznit.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.288
Wow! This view really is the shiznit.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.928
You see that factory way out there?

10:38.371 --> 10:42.364
Yeah, my pop's been working there since
he graduated Tree Hill.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.932
Six days a week, on second shift.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.710
So, we supposed to tell each other
something personal, right?

10:50.182 --> 10:51.410
Yeah.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.153
Okay, well, here's mine.

10:55.521 --> 11:00.356
There's a job waiting on me in that place
if I don't get a scholarship to college.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.758
That's not gonna happen, Skills.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.889
- I can feel it.
- I'm glad you're so sure...

11:06.966 --> 11:09.901
No, the baby's kicking, I can feel it, here.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.430
It's like a step show.

11:15.441 --> 11:18.342
- Something personal, right?
- Yeah.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.046
So, I guess I was right
about the partial nudity thing.

11:25.117 --> 11:28.416
- The boys' locker room?
- I'm just following the assignment.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.216
You see this bench press?

11:30.723 --> 11:34.352
The summer when I decided to really
dedicate myself to basketball,

11:34.427 --> 11:37.487
my dad told me that I was way too skinny
to ever be a great player.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.225
He said I wasn't tough enough
and I wasn't strong enough.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.493
So, to prove him wrong,

11:41.567 --> 11:43.933
I spent every single day
in this weight room.

11:44.003 --> 11:47.131
It's like a thousand degrees in here
but I wasn't gonna let him be right.

11:47.206 --> 11:51.108
- Anger is motivation.
- Anger and inspiration.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.215
Every time I benched another 10 pounds,
I'd scratch two letters into the plate.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.807
What is that?

11:59.952 --> 12:01.442
PS?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.780
It was the same summer
we started dating.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.987
We were pretty good together,
weren't we?

12:09.128 --> 12:11.028
Give me your hand.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.565
Come here. I want you to feel this.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.500
Jeez, what happened?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.867
I broke that knuckle punching something

12:18.938 --> 12:21.930
after we'd broken up for,
like, the 20th time.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.941
We were horrible together.

12:24.009 --> 12:27.342
Yeah, I know.
I was kind of hoping you forgot.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.939
Okay, so, I don't get it.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.381
We're supposed to do the stuff on this list

12:32.451 --> 12:33.782
and then take a picture for the yearbook?

12:33.853 --> 12:34.877
That's the plan.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.444
Well, I already took my photo
for the yearbook

12:36.522 --> 12:38.752
and my hair looked really pretty that day.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.122
It's not that kind of photo
and, anyway, it doesn't matter,

12:41.193 --> 12:45.061
because this assignment
makes me wanna get high.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.233
- Seriously.
- You're not listening.

12:48.300 --> 12:53.533
See, this assignment
makes me wanna get high.

13:00.379 --> 13:04.179
The teachers keep all their current exams
in this file cabinet.

13:06.652 --> 13:09.678
I got a copy of the key and I stole the test.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.216
That's great, Brooke. Anything else?

13:15.127 --> 13:19.086
I don't really believe in Clean Teens.
I just stayed in it because of you.

13:20.132 --> 13:24.398
That's the one thing I was really truthful
about, my feelings for you.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.730
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

13:39.919 --> 13:42.717
- Anyone for starting over?
- Hey.

13:44.723 --> 13:48.557
I'm sorry about judging you.
You seem like a really nice guy.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.562
- Okay, you gotta stop saying that.
- Why?

13:52.631 --> 13:56.795
Because that's part of the problem.
I hate being the nice guy.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.770
The little brother, the great friend.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.503
Just once
I'd like to be a little dangerous, you know?

14:04.577 --> 14:05.942
Not so safe.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.608
Yeah.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.376
So, what's next on the list?

14:13.686 --> 14:18.817
Okay, "Lighten up. Do an impression
of a celebrity or famous character."

14:22.061 --> 14:23.050
Okay.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.528
"This is gonna be awesome, baby!

14:26.599 --> 14:30.535
"He's a diaper dandy, a trifecta magician!"

14:32.872 --> 14:37.036
It's Dick Vitale. He's a sports announcer.
He's really famous.

14:40.746 --> 14:45.376
"You seem somewhat familiar, love.
Have I threatened you before?"

14:47.219 --> 14:49.881
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.618
So, my sister Mary-Kate was like,

14:53.692 --> 14:56.593
"Ashley, you really need
to eat something."

14:56.662 --> 14:59.756
"Merry Christmas,
you old Building and Loan!"

14:59.832 --> 15:02.096
"I like you. Do you like me?"

15:02.868 --> 15:05.632
"I like sexy time explosion."

15:06.438 --> 15:10.135
"I'm sorry Dawson, I just... I love Pacey."

15:10.376 --> 15:14.369
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President."

15:15.080 --> 15:17.446
"Say hello to my little friend!"

15:19.585 --> 15:22.554
"My wife, she very nice. High five!"

15:23.188 --> 15:26.988
"My precious! Oh, my precious!
Gotta keep it from the hobbitses.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.856
"Oh, the hobbitses!"

15:31.363 --> 15:33.558
You do a really good Elmo.

15:40.005 --> 15:44.032
"Admit something that worries you
or something you're afraid of."

15:44.777 --> 15:45.937
You.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.945
Me? Why?

15:50.516 --> 15:54.043
Because you're really pretty,

15:55.220 --> 15:57.415
and it's kind of intimidating.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.454
I've walked into a hundred enemy gyms,
thousands of fans screaming at me,

16:06.532 --> 16:09.023
taunting me, I never flinched.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.502
I'd just take it all and light them up.
No fear.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.337
But the thought of being a father?

16:19.044 --> 16:21.239
It scares the hell out of me.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.042
I love the idea of being a mom, I really do,

16:27.152 --> 16:30.485
but I just...
I still wanna leave my mark on this world.

16:31.256 --> 16:34.987
And that's what scares you?
Not having a chance to do that?

16:35.961 --> 16:39.089
Yeah, a little,

16:41.233 --> 16:42.632
and clowns.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.065
Clowns really scare me.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.368
What are you afraid of, Rachel?

16:48.807 --> 16:50.035
Rachel?

16:53.445 --> 16:58.041
I'm afraid... I am way too high to care.

17:08.227 --> 17:11.162
I was worried
I wouldn't be enough for you.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.792
That's why I lied.

17:17.469 --> 17:21.405
That's what I'm afraid of,
not being enough.

17:22.141 --> 17:27.044
Not good enough, not smart enough,
not pretty enough, not...

17:27.112 --> 17:29.137
Brooke,
you're the Student Council President,

17:29.214 --> 17:32.581
captain of the cheerleaders, and probably
one of the most popular girls in school.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.881
How is that not good enough?

17:34.953 --> 17:37.444
I don't know. You should ask my parents,

17:37.556 --> 17:40.525
considering they haven't called
in a month.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.095
Month and a half, actually.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.198
Not a single call or text or e-mail.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.064
So, what do you suppose
that says about me?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.501
I think it says more about your parents.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.240
You haven't told me what you're afraid of.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.647
I'm afraid of my mom.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.949
Come on. Is she really that bad?

18:10.722 --> 18:12.883
You see these diamond earrings?

18:12.958 --> 18:16.758
I can only wear them at school
because I stole them from her.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.565
- Why?
- 'Cause she loves them more than me.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.425
How about you?

18:24.236 --> 18:26.761
I'm killing two birds with one stone.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.001
Something personal
and something I'm afraid of.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.408
This is the first draft of a novel I'm writing.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.511
That's the personal part.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.146
- Who knew?
- No one.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.715
How come?

18:46.792 --> 18:50.159
My first dream
was to play professional basketball.

18:51.263 --> 18:54.892
I already gave that up.
You're holding my second dream.

18:56.101 --> 18:59.798
If this thing sucks, it's gonna be
kind of hard to find a third one.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.444
Okay, "What do you plan
to be in ten years?"

19:17.156 --> 19:21.650
In ten years, I plan to be 28.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.693
Not at this rate.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.930
I want my fashion line
to be hugely successful.

19:35.874 --> 19:39.537
I'd like to be a pilot.
Well, I've always wanted to fly.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.347
Just jet off to faraway places.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.916
- Milan.
- Why not?

19:49.488 --> 19:51.922
That, or be an X Games champion.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.020
Totally make Clean Teens look bad-ass.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.458
Well, I hope in ten years,
Haley's got a bunch of platinum albums,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.832
my dad learns
how to be a good grandparent,

20:04.903 --> 20:08.339
my mom's alive and sober,

20:09.107 --> 20:12.372
and, hopefully,
my son will have a killer crossover dribble.

20:12.444 --> 20:17.882
Okay, but the question is
about you, doofus.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.683
Where do you plan to be in ten years?

20:21.753 --> 20:23.618
I know,

20:23.689 --> 20:27.455
but if everybody else's dreams come true,
then I'll be fine.

20:28.293 --> 20:31.023
Nate, I think it's great
that you take care of Haley

20:31.096 --> 20:33.087
and that you're worried about your family,

20:33.165 --> 20:36.259
but if you don't start putting yourself first
every once in a while

20:36.335 --> 20:39.168
and chasing your own dream,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.934
then I'm scared
you're gonna wake up one day

20:42.007 --> 20:44.305
and have to wonder what could've been,

20:44.743 --> 20:46.040
like Dan.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.412
Don't be haunted like that, Nate.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.588
You know basketball's global now, right?

20:58.657 --> 21:02.991
I mean, everybody think being a pro
is just NBA.

21:04.830 --> 21:08.766
Me, I'd be happy just playing basketball
overseas somewhere.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.394
So, when you all roll through
on the world tour,

21:11.470 --> 21:14.564
we can remember this day,
sit back and laugh about it.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.370
Oh, man, I'd love to play music for a living.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.071
But if that doesn't happen,
I'll still be happy.

21:21.146 --> 21:24.343
Yeah? Doing what?

21:24.883 --> 21:28.375
You know, I don't know yet,
but whatever it is, it'll be okay

21:28.453 --> 21:31.047
'cause I'll have a great group of friends
that I can laugh with

21:31.123 --> 21:34.615
and a few secret comforts
that keep me sane.

21:34.693 --> 21:39.255
Like, I want a great big tabby cat that
greets me when I come home every day.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.731
And a boy that I'm in love with.

21:44.703 --> 21:49.367
Yeah, in ten years, I'm definitely in love.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.512
Well, if I don't make it as a writer,

21:55.580 --> 21:58.140
I can always come back here
and coach the Ravens.

21:58.216 --> 22:02.516
I mean, Whitey's retiring, my mom's here,
and, besides, I love this place.

22:02.587 --> 22:07.490
Not me. I can't wait to get out of here.
I'm going as far away as I can get.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.722
I'm gonna try and
forget this place ever existed.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.726
I never thought about teaching until now,

22:14.800 --> 22:17.598
but I think
I could be really happy doing that.

22:18.770 --> 22:22.536
When I tutor someone
and I watch them get it,

22:22.607 --> 22:26.839
like that light goes on,
it just feels really good.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.203
Anyway...

22:31.583 --> 22:35.713
So, look, we got one more thing to do
before we take our pictures.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.020
"Tell your partner a secret."

22:43.562 --> 22:45.257
This one gonna do some damage.

22:45.731 --> 22:49.633
Rachel bet me that I couldn't sleep
with you within three dates.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.666
Wow.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.108
But I need you to know something.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.946
I would've never ever asked you
to compromise what you believe in,

23:04.015 --> 23:06.347
or tried to pressure you out of it.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.655
That's the truth
and I just need you to know it,

23:13.291 --> 23:16.783
even though I know
I don't have a chance with you now.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.158
Is that it? No more secrets?

23:23.368 --> 23:26.098
That's it. I promise.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.873
Well, here's one more.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.474
You are enough, Brooke.

23:34.546 --> 23:37.310
And if I can just get you to quit lying,

23:37.382 --> 23:41.580
I think I might like the real you, but...

23:43.488 --> 23:46.889
Don't tell. It's a secret.

23:54.332 --> 23:57.199
What time is it?
Feels like we've been in here forever.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.499
Well, that's because you're wasted.

23:59.604 --> 24:03.597
I don't suppose you wanna tell me a secret
and actually participate.

24:06.878 --> 24:11.178
I'll tell you a secret, not because of class,

24:11.783 --> 24:13.478
just because.

24:16.555 --> 24:20.286
I've never really felt anything
with the guys I slept with.

24:21.593 --> 24:25.324
When I got my new body,
I thought it would change everything.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.660
Maybe it did for the boys, not for me.

24:33.371 --> 24:36.704
You know, I always wondered
what it would be like to be a dude.

24:36.775 --> 24:40.734
Like, walking through the halls in jeans
and a ratty T-shirt, all bad-ass.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.771
You know, talking smack
and checking out chicks and stuff.

24:44.850 --> 24:48.081
Checking out chicks,
maybe that's my problem.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.218
Maybe I'm into girls.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.528
- What the hell are you doing?
- Did you feel anything?

24:59.598 --> 25:02.089
- No!
- Then you're not into girls.

25:02.167 --> 25:06.627
Trust me, Rachel, I'm a really good kisser,
and you'd totally be into me right now.

25:08.707 --> 25:11.335
It's my scholarship offer or not.

25:11.409 --> 25:14.674
I mean,
I haven't had the courage to open it yet.

25:14.746 --> 25:17.146
Skills, you can't keep this a secret.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.673
Come on, I've got a really
good feeling about it. Open it.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.585
- Okay, just give me a few minutes, though.
- Okay.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.760
Why don't you tell me your secret?

25:32.764 --> 25:34.391
Now we talking.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.799
Sometimes I feel

25:40.472 --> 25:42.667
incredibly disconnected.

25:43.341 --> 25:49.974
Really uncomfortable in my own skin,
or kind of like I don't fit into this world.

25:52.918 --> 25:56.684
Like I was born at the wrong time
and I don't belong.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.451
I just think about my son and it scares me

26:02.561 --> 26:06.361
because I don't ever want him
to feel like he doesn't belong.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.900
I don't know if my heart could bear that.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.931
No, he'll belong.

26:17.776 --> 26:21.234
- The kid gonna rock this place.
- You think so?

26:21.313 --> 26:24.646
Oh, yeah, I do,
'cause his mom got his back.

26:25.684 --> 26:29.347
And if she don't, I do, I promise.

26:32.857 --> 26:35.485
Okay, here.

26:39.097 --> 26:43.124
- You're on the pill.
- No. No, I'm not on the pill.

26:43.635 --> 26:47.594
You have the pill but you're not on it.
That's very secretive.

26:49.674 --> 26:54.111
When my mom was in high school,
she was one of the pretty and popular.

26:54.179 --> 26:57.740
And I think her greatest disappointment
is that I'm not.

26:58.416 --> 27:01.908
Sometimes she teases me about it, and
not in a fun way.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.653
Like, why can't I lose some weight?
And I'll never get a boyfriend.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.030
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.998
Anyway, one day I got some flowers
from my boyfriend.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.538
So, you have a boyfriend.

27:21.606 --> 27:25.337
No. I made him up
and I sent the flowers to myself.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.639
He was pretty awesome, though.
He sent me all kinds of things.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.704
Your imaginary boyfriend?

27:32.283 --> 27:34.945
Anyway, I told my mom
we were getting serious

27:35.020 --> 27:37.511
and that maybe I should go on the pill.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.080
And in my head, I thought
it would be this bonding experience.

27:40.158 --> 27:43.184
Like she'd secretly be happy for me

27:43.261 --> 27:45.456
and sit me down
and counsel me about being safe

27:45.530 --> 27:49.364
or just tell me to wait or just be my mom.

27:50.802 --> 27:54.363
Instead, she took me to the doctor
and got me the pill,

27:54.973 --> 27:56.235
and when we left the pharmacy,

27:56.307 --> 27:58.901
she handed me the prescription
and she said,

27:58.977 --> 28:02.572
"I don't know who would sleep with you,
but here you go."

28:04.282 --> 28:06.682
I'm sorry, Glenda.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.786
It's okay.

28:10.822 --> 28:11.880
So, I looked at her, and I said,

28:11.956 --> 28:16.154
"Well, I don't know who would sleep
with you, either, but here I am."

28:16.695 --> 28:20.131
And we haven't spoken since, not a word.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.028
How long has it been?

28:24.302 --> 28:25.929
Like eight weeks.

28:27.806 --> 28:32.641
She just drops me off at school
and picks me up, and we just don't talk.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.210
There's just silence.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.841
Silence and disappointment.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.656
My mom tried to kill herself.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.423
What?

28:52.130 --> 28:56.897
She just took a bunch of her pills.
I haven't told anybody, just Haley.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.237
Nathan, I'm so sorry...

29:00.305 --> 29:04.241
The worst part about it is,
when I found out that she might die,

29:05.310 --> 29:09.406
there was a moment, just a fraction
of a second, where I actually...

29:10.348 --> 29:13.715
I felt relieved,
like maybe it was for the best.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.515
You believe that?

29:16.588 --> 29:20.615
A kid actually feeling relief
at the thought of losing his mother?

29:20.692 --> 29:21.886
Well...

29:21.960 --> 29:25.191
What kind of person
does that make me, Peyton?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.163
That I could feel that?

29:32.337 --> 29:34.032
I can't whistle.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.435
Nothing.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.710
That's terrible. How can you not whistle?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.879
I know! Okay, I'm pathetic.

29:53.224 --> 29:56.785
I've got a pair of leather pants in my locker
that I've been dying to wear.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.421
Nice. You should totally rock those.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.593
I can't. I'm a Clean Teen.

30:03.668 --> 30:07.331
- It doesn't exactly fit the image.
- Then change the image.

30:14.045 --> 30:17.845
Mouth, before I took back my virginity,

30:20.051 --> 30:24.818
I was kind of friendly.

30:26.858 --> 30:28.758
It just figures, everyone saw me as a slut,

30:28.827 --> 30:33.127
and now I'm this radical virgin
who can't wear a pair of leather pants.

30:35.233 --> 30:38.862
Sometimes I just wish
they'd see me as a girl, you know?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.139
Just a girl.

30:42.941 --> 30:45.933
Nice. Cool sometimes.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.810
Dorky.

30:51.716 --> 30:53.183
Beautiful.

30:58.056 --> 31:01.924
So, how do you know
about all this media stuff?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.824
Oh, me and Jimmy...

31:07.398 --> 31:08.831
Jimmy Edwards.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.264
He was my friend.

31:16.241 --> 31:19.176
I miss him a lot.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.275
I have to keep it a secret

31:24.349 --> 31:28.285
because he killed Lucas's Uncle Keith,
and I loved Keith.

31:31.923 --> 31:35.620
But it doesn't mean I don't miss my friend,
you know?

31:35.693 --> 31:38.321
Especially with graduation coming up.

31:47.472 --> 31:51.602
So I... I never told you what I'm afraid of.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.771
Second question on the list.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.642
I'm kind of afraid of being here with you.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.475
Why?

32:02.987 --> 32:05.080
'Cause I'm a Clean Teen

32:07.825 --> 32:09.383
and you're hot.

32:13.197 --> 32:15.222
I'm sorry I lied, Chase.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.967
It's just you're a Clean Teen
and you're hot, and...

32:26.544 --> 32:29.035
Were you serious about me
being decent-looking

32:29.113 --> 32:32.241
or were you just trying to make up
for the geek comment?

32:32.317 --> 32:36.253
I didn't say "decent-looking," I said "hot."

32:39.657 --> 32:40.919
Mouth...

32:42.393 --> 32:44.657
- I'm a Clean Teen.
- So what?

32:59.043 --> 33:01.978
So, I've been thinking
about your manuscript.

33:02.513 --> 33:05.744
You need to give it to someone
who won't go easy on you.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.810
- Someone who's gonna tell you the truth.
- Someone like you?

33:10.989 --> 33:15.016
I haven't actually been that truthful.
I mean, not about school.

33:16.661 --> 33:20.654
The truth is, I'm gonna miss this place
and it's all my fault.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.360
I just wish I would've tried harder.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.068
I mean,
I just didn't want to look like an idiot.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.007
I think everybody
feels that way sometimes.

33:33.611 --> 33:37.945
You know, like, people don't see them
for who they really are.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.711
It's not just you.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.983
You would've made a great goth,
you know that?

33:45.056 --> 33:48.025
A little tortured, bit of a loner,

33:49.360 --> 33:50.622
but kind.

33:53.664 --> 33:56.394
Hey, I have an idea for your picture.

33:57.835 --> 34:00.633
Thank God,
this ridiculous class is almost over.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.070
I liked it.

34:04.008 --> 34:07.444
That's because
you're too blissfully stupid to resist.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.145
I know people think I'm stupid,

34:13.083 --> 34:14.710
but I'm not dumb.

34:16.286 --> 34:17.879
I just let you and the other girls
have your way

34:17.955 --> 34:20.947
because that's how you need it to be.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.050
But I think Carl's right.

34:23.527 --> 34:27.362
Pretty soon we're all gonna graduate
and I can start over.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.563
It'll be harder for the people
who need this place

34:30.635 --> 34:33.001
to make themselves feel special.

34:35.206 --> 34:39.905
The people who use high school
to build themselves up, and then find out

34:39.976 --> 34:44.539
that the real world doesn't care so much
about who you were in high school.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.277
People like you.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.818
Okay, so what are we gonna do
for our pictures?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.934
- You need to go get those leather pants.
- What?

35:05.002 --> 35:06.594
For the picture.

35:08.673 --> 35:11.403
Also, you need to take off your shirt.

35:12.343 --> 35:13.367
Wait, what?

35:13.644 --> 35:17.136
- Take off your shirt.
- Wow, just like the old days.

35:17.215 --> 35:20.082
Stop it. I have an idea for your picture.

35:20.151 --> 35:22.642
But before you do that, come here.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.054
Look, the bell's gonna ring soon

35:27.125 --> 35:29.059
and I don't know
if I'm going to get a chance to say it,

35:29.127 --> 35:31.425
so I'm just gonna say it now.

35:31.896 --> 35:34.160
You're doing great, Nathan.

35:34.232 --> 35:37.668
All right?
Just please put yourself first sometimes.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.438
Well, now let's see the merchandise!

35:41.506 --> 35:44.703
- Oh, funny.
- Let's go. Chop chop, baby.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.709
I want you to open it.

35:50.081 --> 35:53.881
Tell me if it's the factory or college.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.947
All right, but I want you to know
no matter this letter says,

35:59.023 --> 36:02.789
you're gonna find your way
to some great things. I know it.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.924
Yeah, well, if it all means the same,

36:05.997 --> 36:09.194
I'd rather find my great things
through college.

36:20.278 --> 36:24.647
Well, it looks like you'll be going
into that factory.

36:28.386 --> 36:32.982
And you're gonna tell your father
that you just got a full ride to college.

36:36.460 --> 36:40.021
Girl, that's messed up.
I almost threw my ass off this damn roof.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.086
I'm sorry.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.302
So, how about it?

36:46.370 --> 36:49.362
You think one class can change your life?

36:49.440 --> 36:52.341
The way you kiss? Definitely.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.307
You still think you're not good enough?

36:57.481 --> 36:59.949
I don't think that ever goes away.

37:00.618 --> 37:04.315
But I think you just have
to learn to deal with it, you know?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.049
Learn to use it.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.059
So let's use it, then.

37:21.839 --> 37:25.741
<i>Today, I spent an hour with Brooke Davis</i>
<i>and I learned something.</i>

37:26.677 --> 37:28.838
<i>People are gonna label you.</i>

37:29.347 --> 37:31.872
<i>It's how you overcome those labels.</i>

37:33.751 --> 37:35.514
<i>That's what matters.</i>

37:41.192 --> 37:43.592
<i>I spent an hour with Chase Adams.</i>

37:45.930 --> 37:47.557
<i>He's a Clean Teen</i>

37:49.133 --> 37:51.033
<i>and that's pretty cool.</i>

37:57.575 --> 38:00.169
<i>People think they know Nathan Scott.</i>

38:01.078 --> 38:02.568
<i>I know I did.</i>

38:02.647 --> 38:05.275
<i>But I discovered something new today.</i>

38:07.184 --> 38:09.175
<i>Nathan Scott is a martyr.</i>

38:11.922 --> 38:14.516
<i>He's also gonna be a terrific father.</i>

38:17.795 --> 38:20.389
<i>I spent the class with Peyton Sawyer.</i>

38:21.332 --> 38:24.301
<i>It reminded me what a good friend she is.</i>

38:24.368 --> 38:27.166
<i>I also learned that,</i>
<i>considering recent history,</i>

38:27.238 --> 38:30.469
<i>she's not quite ready</i>
<i>for the whole picture thing.</i>

38:34.478 --> 38:37.345
<i>Some of you have met</i>
<i>Shelly Simon, Clean Teen.</i>

38:37.848 --> 38:41.306
<i>But today, I got to know</i>
<i>Shelly Simon, teen.</i>

38:42.953 --> 38:44.682
<i>I also asked her to prom.</i>

38:48.959 --> 38:51.826
<i>An hour ago,</i>
<i>I called Marvin McFadden nice.</i>

38:54.565 --> 38:55.930
<i>He is.</i>

38:57.168 --> 38:59.864
<i>But I should have called him dangerous.</i>

39:02.840 --> 39:04.671
<i>I also said yes to prom.</i>

39:07.778 --> 39:10.838
<i>This is one of the best classes</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

39:13.050 --> 39:15.075
<i>A kick-ass 50 minutes,</i>

39:16.087 --> 39:19.955
<i>during which, Bevin told me</i>
<i>she always wanted to be a guy.</i>

39:30.167 --> 39:31.657
<i>I spent the hour with Rachel</i>

39:31.736 --> 39:35.103
<i>and I think she learned today</i>
<i>that I am not an idiot.</i>

39:37.274 --> 39:39.333
<i>This is my picture of her.</i>

39:42.279 --> 39:45.043
<i>Over the years,</i>
<i>I've known Haley James, bookworm,</i>

39:45.116 --> 39:49.576
<i>Haley James, sarcastic girl,</i>
<i>Haley James Scott, rock star,</i>

39:49.653 --> 39:52.144
<i>and Haley James Scott, mother-to-be.</i>

39:52.223 --> 39:56.489
<i>Today, I got reacquainted</i>
<i>with just Haley, my good friend.</i>

39:57.495 --> 39:59.463
<i>She getting heavier, too.</i>

40:00.431 --> 40:03.525
<i>Skills has been my friend</i>
<i>since we were young.</i>

40:04.235 --> 40:06.863
<i>And today, I remembered why.</i>

40:06.937 --> 40:11.704
<i>He's a great listener,</i>
<i>he's gonna do awesome in college,</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:15.243
<i>and he deserves to be on top of the world.</i>

40:15.846 --> 40:19.009
<i>Fifty minutes ago,</i>
<i>I called Lucas Scott a jock,</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:20.846
<i>but I was wrong.</i>

40:20.918 --> 40:24.251
<i>He's more than one simple word.</i>
<i>I guess we all are.</i>

40:24.922 --> 40:28.380
<i>Anyway, I learned</i>
<i>that Lucas is actually a lot like me.</i>

40:29.293 --> 40:30.624
<i>Who knew?</i>

40:34.031 --> 40:37.330
<i>I wish I would've hung out</i>
<i>with Glenda before today.</i>

40:38.536 --> 40:41.869
<i>Something tells me</i>
<i>she could've been a great friend.</i>

40:43.340 --> 40:46.241
<i>But it's good to know</i>
<i>there's still a little time left to do that.</i>

40:46.310 --> 40:47.538
Glenda.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.485
Listen, would you mind
taking a look at this for me?

40:59.557 --> 41:02.924
I need someone
I can trust to tell me the truth.

41:02.993 --> 41:05.791
Sure. Okay, Lucas Scott.

41:07.798 --> 41:11.199
Hey, today was awesome.
I had a blast with you.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.038
See you tomorrow.

41:16.106 --> 41:18.472
<i>And I also learned her last name.</i>

41:18.542 --> 41:20.271
Hey, Mrs. Farrell.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.776
Okay, Mom, let's go.

41:34.325 --> 41:39.024
<i>And I learned</i>
<i>that one hour can change everything.</i>
