28:30.709 --> 28:34.013
EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP
OR SOMEONE TO TALK TO--

28:34.046 --> 28:36.548
SOMEONE A LITTLE
BIT MORE SENIOR.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.186
HE FELL OFF THE SWING
SET IN THE BACKYARD?

28:40.219 --> 28:40.953
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:40.987 --> 28:44.223
THERE ISN'T A SWING SET.

28:45.758 --> 28:49.762
SOMEONE TO TALK TO
IN ADDITION, OF COURSE,

28:49.796 --> 28:52.364
TO YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR FATHER.

28:52.398 --> 28:56.402
MY FATHER BEATS ME.

29:12.985 --> 29:13.920
WHERE'S MOM?

29:13.953 --> 29:16.889
SHE IS OUT
WITH AUNT MOLLY.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.993

CIRCUMSTANCE MOMENT.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.661
YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

29:22.694 --> 29:23.462
DAD?

29:23.495 --> 29:27.199
NOBODY FORCED YOU
TO JOIN THE ARMY.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.969
LOOK AT ALL THESE FORMS.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.804
DRIVE ANYBODY INSANE,

29:31.838 --> 29:35.407
BUT I DIDN'T JOIN THE ARMY
TO DO HOMEWORK, DID I?

29:35.441 --> 29:39.578
I JOINED THE ARMY
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE BIG MONEY WAS.

29:39.611 --> 29:46.986
TILL THEY TOOK AWAY
MY CLOTHING ALLOWANCE
AND MY COMBAT PAY.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.125
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

29:53.159 --> 29:56.963
BUT I WONDER IF I'M GOING
TO LIKE THIS NEW BASE.

29:56.996 --> 30:00.199
WHY ARE WE MOVING?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.842
WE'RE GOING
TO BE NEAR THE BEACH.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.311
NEAR YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.645
BUT WHY?

30:13.679 --> 30:15.882
I'VE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME, BABY.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.150
BUT YOU LOVE THIS JOB.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.519
AND I PROMISED
YOUR MAMA A CHANGE.

30:20.552 --> 30:24.857
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT ME TO BREAK
MY PROMISE, WOULD YA?

30:24.891 --> 30:26.392
DADDY?

30:26.425 --> 30:27.894
YEAH.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.263
ARE YOU ALWAYS STRONG?

30:34.033 --> 30:37.836
NOBODY'S ALWAYS STRONG.

30:39.205 --> 30:44.076

WAS THE YOUNG BOY'S
TEACHER 3 YEARS AGO.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.011
3 YEARS AGO?

30:45.044 --> 30:47.213
HE CAME TO HER FIRST,

30:47.246 --> 30:50.149
BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS CLOSE.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.650
HIS PARENTS?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.252
I DO NOT KNOW.

30:53.285 --> 30:56.155
WE BROUGHT HIM HOME AND HE...

30:56.188 --> 30:58.157
HE SAID THAT
HIS FATHER BEATS HIM.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.926
HIS FATHER
BROKE HIS ARM?

30:59.959 --> 31:02.694
HE SAID THAT HE FELL
FROM A SWING SET.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.163
WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM HOME,

31:04.196 --> 31:07.934
HE CHANGED HIS STORY
AND SAID THAT HIS FATHER--

31:07.967 --> 31:09.001
HIS FATHER BEAT HIM.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.103
HIS FATHER'S
NOT HERE NOW.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.940
HE CAME TO
YOUR MS. GERHARDT--

31:13.973 --> 31:15.207
THAT'S RIGHT.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.675
BECAUSE...

31:16.708 --> 31:17.676
YOU SIT HERE, BABY.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.047
I'M GOING TO GO GET
YOU A FEW THINGS, OK?

31:26.818 --> 31:29.188
I SHOULD HAVE
TRIED HERE FIRST.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.122
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.857
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TRIED HERE FIRST?

31:31.890 --> 31:32.959
SAM LIVES HERE.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.693
NO, HE'S BEEN
LIVING WITH HIS AUNT
THE LAST 6 MONTHS.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.763
YOU'RE SURE HE DOESN'T LIVE
WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER?

31:37.796 --> 31:38.965
I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD.

31:38.998 --> 31:44.503

I AM HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.671
HIS FATHER DIDN'T
BREAK HIS ARM.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.107

HE BREAK HIS ARM?
