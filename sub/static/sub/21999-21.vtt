WEBVTT

00:08.747 --> 00:10.749
Rosenberg? You guys
involved in this one?

00:10.793 --> 00:13.274
Yeah, well, the guy's
a postal worker, right?

00:13.317 --> 00:15.145
That makes him
a federal employee.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.582
That makes this potentially
a capital crime.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.368
Well, it's not like
he was delivering the mail

00:20.411 --> 00:23.023
when it happened. When we hear that one
of our federal employees

00:23.066 --> 00:26.287
and his family have been a victim
of arson, rape and murder,

00:26.330 --> 00:30.073
we like to stick our nose in,
see what's what.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.162
Want to give me a tour?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.255
That's the husband and wife.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.736
Not sure if you can
tell, but she's naked.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.607
Both tied to those chairs.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.522
In addition to burning to death,

00:44.566 --> 00:48.222
we believe there are multiple
stab wounds on both victims.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.832
Won't be sure for a while.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.704
Can't really handle the
bodies in this state.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
So, what do we know?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
Silver Ford Explorer
missing from the driveway.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.364
We've got an APB out
across the entire state.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.453
He stole their car? You think the guy's

01:02.497 --> 01:04.063
stupid enough
to still be driving it?

01:04.107 --> 01:05.891
Takes all kinds of stupid
to make a world.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.503
What else we got?
What's with the bike?

01:08.546 --> 01:10.374
12-year-old daughter.

01:10.418 --> 01:11.549
She wasn't home.

01:11.593 --> 01:14.509
At a friend's for a sleepover.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.772
Only silver lining.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074

01:29.219 --> 01:31.961
You, silver Explorer, pull over.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.622
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

01:40.665 --> 01:42.319
Do it now!

01:49.109 --> 01:52.373
Okay, now, I need to see your
license and registration.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.289
Your license in your pocket?

01:55.332 --> 01:57.291
Okay, you can reach for it.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.901
No sudden moves.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.606
Put your hands on
the steering wheel.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.176
Elliot Miles?

02:13.220 --> 02:16.440
You call this in.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.964
The hell is this?

02:41.422 --> 02:42.727
Hey.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.949
I saw you kissing that teenager.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.212
You know, that's against
the law in this country,

02:49.256 --> 02:50.692
and most other
civilized societies

02:50.735 --> 02:52.017
around the world,
for that matter.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.477
Right, right.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.915
No, she is 34.
I know she looks younger.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.179
Said Jerry Lee Lewis
to the judge.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.484
No, no, no.

03:00.528 --> 03:03.357
We, we met at the airport

03:03.400 --> 03:05.054
over Thanksgiving.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.709
Just got back in touch
a couple weeks ago.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.276
And for you, sir?

03:09.319 --> 03:10.799
I'll have what he's having.

03:10.842 --> 03:14.237
So... what are we doing here?

03:14.281 --> 03:17.893
What was so urgent
that you had to tear me away

03:17.936 --> 03:19.895
from my life of
nomadic introspection

03:19.938 --> 03:21.157
and years of sexual depravity?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.072
Well, it's...

03:23.115 --> 03:25.814
it's good news... I think.

03:25.857 --> 03:29.209
Just not the kind of news
you discuss in the office.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.300
My sister...

03:33.343 --> 03:35.476
she's getting remarried.

03:38.043 --> 03:42.047
Which means you, my friend,
are off the hook.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.528
No more alimony,

03:44.572 --> 03:47.139
no more rent
on that Tribeca co-op.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.359
You are a free man.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.970
Financially speaking.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.716
She's been...

03:58.760 --> 04:01.937
meaning to tell you
for a month or so.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.766
That's why she left you
all those phone messages.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.073
But then she chickened out.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.555
And here I am, the bearer of...

04:11.599 --> 04:14.254
whatever kind of news
you think it is.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.952
That's great.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.433
I'm happy for her. Really.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.218
No, I... knew you would be.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.266
So, where'd your girlfriend go?

04:27.789 --> 04:30.792
At a wine bar,
right down the street.

04:32.402 --> 04:35.057
What are you doing here?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.102
Talking to you.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.758
Now, get out of here.
Go see your girlfriend.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.935
It's getting late... you don't
want her to miss her curfew.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.085
Hello?

05:03.128 --> 05:04.434
Jason?

05:07.263 --> 05:08.743
Of course.

05:08.786 --> 05:11.223
I'll-I'll get there
as quickly as I can.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.796
Ho-ho-ho! God.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.677
Sorry.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.683
Thanks.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.516
There, you want that back?

05:42.559 --> 05:44.779
You don't want that back.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.526
Thank you.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.448
You got somebody picking you up?

06:01.491 --> 06:04.668
I can... give you
a ride home, if you need.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.372
Well...

06:12.415 --> 06:15.766
you know...

06:15.810 --> 06:18.160
if you ever need anything...

06:18.203 --> 06:20.902
you just give me a call.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.776
Elliot Miles?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.909
The interpreter's on his way.

06:27.952 --> 06:31.129
Officer's gonna walk you
back for questioning.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.223
He doesn't speak English?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.008
He doesn't speak anything.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.705
You Jason Bull?

06:41.749 --> 06:44.142
Someone has to be.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.710
Congratulations.
You've made bail.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
Thank you for doing that.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.367
No problem.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.025
Criminal mischief in
the fourth degree?

06:57.068 --> 06:59.201
Yeah, it sounds worse
than it is.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.986
I got in a fight with one
of those vending machines

07:02.030 --> 07:03.901
that sells you bottles of water.

07:03.945 --> 07:07.078
I gave it three dollars,
and all it did was laugh at me.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.036
So you kicked it?

07:08.079 --> 07:09.341
Kicked it till you broke it?

07:09.385 --> 07:11.561
Well, the only other bills
I had were twenties,

07:11.605 --> 07:13.520
and I wasn't gonna put
one of those in.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.043
When did human beings

07:15.086 --> 07:16.740
start selling water
to each other, anyway?

07:16.784 --> 07:19.047
It falls from the sky.
No one owns it.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.876
When I was a kid, it was
something you offered people.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.660
I'm worried about you.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.706
I'm fine.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.491
I'm fine.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.058
You know what? You're not.

07:30.101 --> 07:33.235
When I met you, you
were ambitious and...

07:33.278 --> 07:35.411
focused and d-disciplined.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.067
My God, I never met anyone
with more discipline.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.590
Last couple of years, though...

07:40.634 --> 07:43.463
Izzy's getting remarried.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.424
Okay.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.080
I'm sorry.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.038
But she wasn't getting
married yesterday,

07:54.082 --> 07:55.518
or last month,

07:55.562 --> 07:56.911
or... Well, apparently she was,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.652
'cause everybody knew
about it except me.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.001
You're changing the subject.

08:00.044 --> 08:03.439
You used to be a
citizen of the world.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.747
You never met a person you
didn't find fascinating.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.445
But lately you live
in your head...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.055
for an audience of one.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.493
I mean, every day, I see
you checking your watch

08:13.536 --> 08:15.973
to see if it's late enough
to have your first drink.

08:16.017 --> 08:19.716
And if it's not that,
it's how long until lunch.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.414
You sleep in your office.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.069
Your clothes don't fit.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.987
I think you are an
amazing person, Jason,

08:30.031 --> 08:32.990
but I am tired of
worrying about you.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.078
Pitying you.

08:37.081 --> 08:40.083
I want to admire you again.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.995
You probably think I'm here
to return your handkerchief.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.997
My name's Dr. Jason Bull,

09:23.040 --> 09:25.129
and I run
a trial science company,

09:25.173 --> 09:27.958
it's a kind of law office...
We help people.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.613
And it occurred to me
after I left here...

09:30.657 --> 09:33.311
you might need help.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.487
I know the idea
of being represented

09:35.531 --> 09:39.187
by someone you met in jail
sounds... unconventional,

09:39.230 --> 09:42.277
but I guarantee you I am...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.496
great at what I do.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.238
Nonetheless...

09:47.282 --> 09:49.632
the government...

09:49.676 --> 09:51.808
wants to execute you...

09:51.852 --> 09:55.986
and I would like to make sure
that doesn't happen.

09:56.030 --> 09:59.511
But there's one thing
I need to know.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.212
Did you do it?

10:07.694 --> 10:10.479
Good answer.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.446
Everybody know who this is?

10:21.490 --> 10:23.207
Isn't that the guy accused
of raping that woman

10:23.231 --> 10:25.165
and burning her and her husband
to death in Brooklyn?

10:25.189 --> 10:27.278
It is. He's also
our newest client.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.932
His name is Elliot Miles.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.693
Yeah, heard on the news
that they're prosecuting

10:30.717 --> 10:32.936
this case as a capital crime.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.504
Feds are looking
for the death penalty.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.246
How did Bull get
roped into this one?

10:38.289 --> 10:40.030
Some hotshot attorney
put the arm on him?

10:40.074 --> 10:45.035
No. Apparently, Bull and Elliot
actually know each other.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.603
And according to
this 20-page e-mail

10:47.647 --> 10:49.997
he sent me late this morning,

10:50.040 --> 10:52.173
Bull believes he's innocent.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.741
Based on everything I'mreading,
he's the only one.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.830
Wait a second.

10:56.873 --> 10:59.354
If he wasn't brought into this
case by the kid's attorney,

10:59.397 --> 11:00.790
then who's the kid's attorney?

11:00.834 --> 11:04.576
I believe that would be
the esteemed Benjamin Colón.

11:05.621 --> 11:08.145
I'm trying a death penalty case?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.712
Certainly appears that way.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.021
Okay, well,

11:14.064 --> 11:15.912
according to the papers,
the kid works in construction.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.546
Lives in Astoria.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.331
Got pulled over
for driving a stolen SUV,

11:20.375 --> 11:23.595
which, turns out,
belongs to the murdered couple.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.554
None of this sounds good.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.774
What does Bull know
that the papers don't?

11:27.817 --> 11:30.254
According to Bull's notes,
Elliot bought the car

11:30.298 --> 11:33.431
two days after the murders.
$600 cash.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.911
He was standing at a bus stop

11:34.955 --> 11:37.348
and a guy pulled over
and offered to sell it to him.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.437
No paperwork,
just money for keys.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.613
And Bull believes that?
According to this e-mail.

11:41.657 --> 11:46.227
He says he sat with Elliot
for two hours.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.770
We get a description
of this generous fellow

11:47.794 --> 11:49.970
who hands out
three-year-old cars for $600?

11:50.013 --> 11:52.494
White male, brown hair,
average height and build.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.452
Wow. That's what,

11:54.496 --> 11:56.411
200 million people?

11:56.454 --> 11:57.997
Also, he was wearing a ring,
a class ring.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.240
It had a green stone.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.502
Well, there you go.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.156
Now we're dealing with
50 million people.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.549
Does he at least have an alibi?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.334
It's pretty weak.

12:06.377 --> 12:09.729
He left the jobsite at 5:30 to
run some errands for his boss.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.079
Says he was done
with those by 6:30.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.864
Ate something and took
a subway ride home to Queens.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.214
His girlfriend says he walked
through the front door

12:17.258 --> 12:18.738
a little after 8:00.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.653
The fire was set around 7:30.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.482
But that was in Brooklyn,
a 20-minute subway ride away.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.310
So theoretically,
he could have done it.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.878
It would have been a sprint,
but he could have done it.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.880
By the way, Bull wants

12:30.924 --> 12:32.882
to get the girlfriend
in here for you to prep.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.842
Okay. Here is the address

12:35.885 --> 12:38.583
of the bus stop where Elliot
bought the dead couple's SUV.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.933
Danny.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.848
Bull would like you
to go down there.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.198
See if anybody saw anything.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.504
And Cable, see if anybody
within a three-block radius

12:46.548 --> 12:47.549
has any cameras.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.290
Anything that can
help us pinpoint

12:49.333 --> 12:52.684
what time Elliot took
possession of that SUV.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.227
Not to mention, maybe
giving us a picture

12:54.251 --> 12:55.775
of the guy who sold it to him.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.037
Done and done.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.429
And one more thing.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.273
They haven't mentioned it
in the news reports,

13:00.301 --> 13:01.824
but Elliot is mute.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.566
Mute? As in can't talk?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.394
But Bull said
he spent two hours with him?

13:06.437 --> 13:08.700
He can hear.
He writes his answers.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.659
Sounds like

13:10.702 --> 13:11.810
he'll make a hell of a witness

13:11.834 --> 13:13.575
if we decide to put him
on the stand.

13:13.618 --> 13:17.622
Sounds like the boss is acting
a tad impetuously on this one.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.668
I'm glad you said it.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.254
I'm sensing some dissension
in the ranks.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.473
Well, get it
out of your systems today

13:22.497 --> 13:23.857
because he's gonna
be in the office

13:23.890 --> 13:25.805
bright and early
tomorrow morning.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.779
Bull?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.303
Yes, Marissa?

13:46.347 --> 13:47.609
Um, you look...

13:47.652 --> 13:49.698
different, um...

13:49.741 --> 13:50.655
Good different.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.787
Well, I bought a new suit.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.875
One that fits.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.703
Slept eight hours. In a row.

13:54.746 --> 13:55.791
In my apartment.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.203
And went a whole day
without a drink.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.099
Okay.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.929
Look, yesterday morning,

14:02.972 --> 14:05.757
I-I may have said some things.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.889
You did.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.239
And I needed to hear them.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.069
I don't want to be someone
you worry about.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.550
I want to be someone you admire.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.943
But I do admire you.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.422
I always have, I always will.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.686
Well, I haven't always
admired me.

14:21.730 --> 14:22.818
Not lately.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.515
But I'm determined
to change that

14:24.559 --> 14:26.430
and I think a big part of that

14:26.474 --> 14:29.869
is sinking our teeth into
something of consequence,

14:29.912 --> 14:32.697
something that matters.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.961
And defending Elliot Miles
is just that.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.921
Is the team excited? Wha... I...

14:38.965 --> 14:41.924
think everyone is
a little overwhelmed.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.187
And plus, I'm not you.
I'm not sure

14:44.231 --> 14:46.450
I was able to convey your...

14:46.494 --> 14:48.539
enthusiasm.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.541
I think they really
need to hear from you.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.239
Let's talk capital murder.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.589
Capital murder cases are unique

14:54.632 --> 14:56.286
in two special ways. For one,

14:56.330 --> 14:59.811
the entire jury has to be
"death-qualified."

14:59.855 --> 15:01.509
Death-qualified?

15:01.552 --> 15:02.771
Well, that sounds morbid.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.077
What does it mean?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.426
It means that during voir dire,

15:05.469 --> 15:08.081
the judge won't even
consider seating a juror

15:08.124 --> 15:10.779
if they haven't already
assured him or her

15:10.822 --> 15:13.086
that they're willing to
convict our client to death.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.262
You said there were
two differences.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.133
Well, there are potentially

15:17.177 --> 15:18.700
two parts of this trial.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.181
The first part is the
typical criminal case,

15:21.224 --> 15:22.965
adjudicating innocence or guilt.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.750
Then, if the client
is found guilty,

15:25.794 --> 15:26.708
there's the penalty phase.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.101
And that's the second part.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.931
And the jury, not the judge,
decides the sentence.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.758
And there are only two choices.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.673
Death or life in prison.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.024
And just in case

15:38.067 --> 15:40.374
you were wondering,
we get the same jury for both.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.506
You really are a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

15:42.550 --> 15:45.335
I just think I'm pretty good
at reading people.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.337
They say this kid's a rapist.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.904
Followed this woman home.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.993
Did what he wanted to do
with her and then,

15:51.037 --> 15:52.821
when her husband surprised them,

15:52.864 --> 15:55.302
he somehow tied them both up
and set the place on fire

15:55.345 --> 15:56.520
to cover his tracks. Okay.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.609
If you say so.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.002
And then he stole their car.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.961
The guy who just
torched the place

16:02.004 --> 16:04.789
so you wouldn't know it was him.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.790
Okay.

16:05.834 --> 16:06.898
If that's what you're selling.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.272
The same kid

16:09.316 --> 16:11.274
offered me his handkerchief

16:11.318 --> 16:13.755
after I puked all over myself
the other night.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.800
Offered me a piece of gum.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.020
Offered me a smile.

16:19.848 --> 16:20.980
He didn't know

16:21.023 --> 16:22.416
who I was.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.895
He just did it.

16:23.939 --> 16:27.073
So I just don't... see it.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.292
Now I sense that
some of you think

16:29.336 --> 16:31.686
getting involved with
this is a fool's errand.

16:31.729 --> 16:34.776
Well... all right,

16:34.819 --> 16:38.432
so be it, but it's your fault
for choosing to work for a fool.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.045
There is nothing that proves
Elliot is guilty.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.526
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the trial of Elliot Miles,

16:45.569 --> 16:47.919
the federal government
is seeking the death penalty.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.835
Before I can seat you, I need
to know that you are capable

16:50.879 --> 16:52.750
and willing to vote
for such a punishment.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.796
Who here has a religious
or moral objection

16:54.839 --> 16:55.839
to the death penalty?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.061
Keep your hands up.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.758
These jurors are dismissed.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.413
No matter who we're left with,
we need to find jurors

17:03.457 --> 17:06.938
who are prone
to reduced emotional reactivity.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.637
People who are more likely to
weigh the facts, not be clouded

17:09.680 --> 17:11.813
by the horror of the crime.

17:11.856 --> 17:15.077
Even if the evidence says
it's possible Elliot did this,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.906
they will see it's
not impossible that he didn't.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.951
Creating reasonable doubt.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.867
Okay. Well, how do we find
these people?

17:22.911 --> 17:24.781
It's actually fairly simple.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.871
We ask about important moments
in their lives,

17:26.915 --> 17:28.743
emotionally charged moments.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.354
People with reduced
emotional reactivity

17:31.398 --> 17:34.923
will talk about births,
deaths, weddings, divorces

17:34.966 --> 17:37.056
in a clinical
and detached fashion.

17:37.099 --> 17:40.972
So they're...
actually pretty easy to spot.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.105
Do you mind if I ask,
has anyone here

17:43.149 --> 17:45.847
recently lost a family member?

17:47.240 --> 17:50.025
Do you feel comfortable
talking about your loss?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.331
Sure.Okay.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.724
Who was it
that passed? My father.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.162
About six months ago.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.686
Worst experience of my life.

17:58.729 --> 18:01.210
Watching him waste away.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.953
Your Honor,

18:04.996 --> 18:07.434
we'd like to,
dismiss this juror.

18:07.477 --> 18:10.219
We want people who keep
their emotions in check.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.308
We're looking
for limited gesturing,

18:12.352 --> 18:14.310
restrained facial expressions,

18:14.354 --> 18:15.877
and definitely...

18:15.920 --> 18:17.661
no criers.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.708
Describe the best day
of your life.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.013
My God.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.841
My wedding day.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.105
My husband was a dancing machine

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
and a drinking machine.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.978
And then he fell into the pool

18:30.021 --> 18:31.240
doing the Electric Slide,

18:31.284 --> 18:33.416
and then he was good
for nothing.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.854
But still,
it was an amazing day.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.685
Divorce.
The greatest day of my life.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.992
You know that joke?

18:44.035 --> 18:45.994
Why is divorce so expensive?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.430
'Cause it's worth it.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.824
I thought of a better day.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.174
The day my ex got remarried.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.176
Bingo.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.873
Like winning the Lotto.

18:57.223 --> 19:00.878
Your Honor, we'd like
to dismiss this juror also.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.577
Man's on a cuttin' frenzy.
Kind of looks that way.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.100
Bull, I know you know this,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.407
but we're running low
on strikes.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.583
Now, is anyone else here
recently divorced?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.673
Would you mind

19:12.716 --> 19:14.240
if I asked what happened?

19:14.283 --> 19:16.242
It was...

19:16.285 --> 19:18.461
He was cheating.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.463
Sounds good. Calm, contained.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.379
You can't see it,
but... look at her jaw.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.990
She's flexing her jaw.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.905
Bull, no. She's good for us.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.516
She's one of our
only women left,

19:29.559 --> 19:32.301
and women are far less likely
to impose the death penalty.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.236
But we won't have to worry
about the death penalty

19:34.260 --> 19:36.610
if we find jurors who won't
convict him in the first place.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.441
Please, Bull.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.660
If I've told you once,
I've told you a hundred times,

19:43.704 --> 19:45.880
voir dire is not about
jury selection, it's about

19:45.923 --> 19:47.098
jury de-selection.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.275
And then this woman
is forcing herself

19:49.318 --> 19:52.234
to be dispassionate, using
every bit of restraint she has.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.018
But it is not her natural state.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.021
Inside she's a cauldron of rage,

19:57.065 --> 19:58.588
and I can't give her
the opportunity

19:58.632 --> 19:59.981
to vent that rage on Elliot.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.896
I'd rather take my chances
on the possibility

20:01.939 --> 20:04.986
that the remaining jurors might
be able to see his innocence

20:05.029 --> 20:07.641
than the virtual certainty
that this woman

20:07.684 --> 20:10.426
will send our client...
away for life,

20:10.470 --> 20:12.950
regardless of gender.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.216
Please, Bull.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.437
Your Honor, we would like
to strike this juror.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.925
Ladies and gentlemen,
the prosecution

20:30.968 --> 20:32.535
and the defense
are out of peremptories.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.711
The next eight
jurors on the roster

20:34.755 --> 20:36.539
will fill the remaining seats.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.541
Prospective jurors
11 through 19,

20:38.585 --> 20:40.543
welcome to the jury.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.154
What the hell
is he doing? I have no idea.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.461
See you all tomorrow
for opening statements.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.587
Figured you might be here.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.415
Well...

21:26.459 --> 21:29.592
had an early morning meeting
with the prosecutor.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.681
Meant to tell you about it,

21:31.725 --> 21:33.770
but you left
in such a huff last night.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.860
I have a... cell phone.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.514
I have e-mail.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.516
Me, too. I guess I was waiting

21:40.560 --> 21:42.823
for you to shoot me a text
and apologize.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.128
Nothing yet.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.002
You know, Bull,
we used to be a...

21:48.045 --> 21:50.091
we used to be a team.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.834
What are you
talking about, Benny?

21:53.877 --> 21:56.315
Used to be that you'd ask me
before you took a case.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.708
Used to be that you'd... ask me

21:58.752 --> 22:00.884
before you blew through
all our jury strikes.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.409
Used to be that you...
cared what I thought.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.107
Okay. What do you think?

22:06.150 --> 22:09.937
I think that you're in the
middle of some kind of crisis.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.027
I don't think that
you're thinking clearly.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.116
Getting arrested,
drinking too much,

22:15.159 --> 22:17.074
taking a death penalty case

22:17.118 --> 22:18.641
'cause a guy gave you
a handkerchief.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.208
I haven't had a drink
in 33 hours.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.862
Meeting with the prosecutor
without me.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.951
He wanted to make a deal.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.474
You're kidding me.

22:25.518 --> 22:26.736
Elliot pleads guilty.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.366
They take the death
penalty off the table.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.653
He agrees to life in prison
and no chance of parole.

22:30.697 --> 22:31.741
And what did you say?

22:31.785 --> 22:33.526
What do you think I said?

22:33.569 --> 22:37.007
Well, I hope you said that you'd
discuss it with our client,

22:37.051 --> 22:38.705
discuss it with your team.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.837
I know how our client feels.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.840
Know how your client feels.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.515
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
That's right.

22:46.539 --> 22:49.629
Y-You don't care what your,
what your team thinks.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.805
You don't care. I forgot.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.154
You know everything.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.416
I know he's innocent.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.983
No, you don't.

22:56.026 --> 22:58.420
You-you-you think he's innocent.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.466
That's not the same thing
and more importantly,

23:00.509 --> 23:03.686
you don't know how
to prove he's innocent.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.340
I guess it doesn't
matter, right?

23:05.384 --> 23:09.083
Because you're on some-some
private, crusade or quest

23:09.126 --> 23:11.085
to prove something
to yourself or my sister

23:11.128 --> 23:13.957
or your father
or I don't know who.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.698
But it's-it's all well and good.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.004
Hey, you know what?

23:17.047 --> 23:18.875
It's-it's your company. Right?

23:18.919 --> 23:20.964
But what you keep
not thinking about

23:21.008 --> 23:23.706
is that you're dragging
the rest of us into it.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.536
And we don't want
to watch a man put to death

23:27.580 --> 23:30.452
and have to live with that
for the rest of our lives,

23:30.496 --> 23:32.933
live with the possibility
that it may be our fault,

23:32.976 --> 23:35.326
that we may have let him down,

23:35.370 --> 23:37.241
that we may have not been
up to the task

23:37.285 --> 23:39.418
and damn it, Bull,
you didn't even ask!

23:41.942 --> 23:43.334
Where are you going?

23:43.378 --> 23:45.946
Coffee! I'm getting coffee.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.603
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.039
I'm Dr. Thiessen.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.910
You can call me Amos.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.782
Morning got a little hectic.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.174
You have kids? No.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.655
I, um, no.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.789
So, why don't we start
with you telling me

24:02.832 --> 24:06.053
a little bit about why you
wanted to try therapy.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.969
Take your time.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.275
Okay.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.119
Of course I'm coming down
for your graduation.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.583
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.413
Anna, honey, yeah, I got to go.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.939
I got to... okay. Okay.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.941
Lily Galloway. Hi.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.116
Chunk Palmer.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.988
I've been expecting you.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.077
When they called you,
they explained to you

24:30.120 --> 24:32.079
why I wanted to see you, right?

24:32.122 --> 24:34.168
Um, kind of.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.997
And you are Elliot's
girlfriend, right?

24:37.040 --> 24:41.001
We live together, yeah.

24:41.044 --> 24:45.179
And you're comfortable with the
idea of testifying for him, yes?

24:45.222 --> 24:48.008
I think so.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.314
I mean...

24:50.358 --> 24:54.101
his face is all over
the Internet and the papers.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.190
It's kind of crazy.

24:58.192 --> 25:01.325
The neighbors are
looking at me funny.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.371
It makes me nervous.

25:03.414 --> 25:06.722
Well, you don't have
to be nervous.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.855
Um, he is counting on you,

25:08.898 --> 25:13.947
but you are what we call
Elliot's alibi witness.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.167
And you're a huge
part of this case.

25:17.211 --> 25:20.649
We need you to help us prove
that he couldn't have done this.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.042
How do you mean?

25:22.085 --> 25:24.392
Well, the only way we have

25:24.435 --> 25:29.179
to refute the idea that he
did this is your testimony

25:29.223 --> 25:31.007
that he came home
a little after 8:00.

25:31.051 --> 25:34.837
You remember saying
that to the police?

25:36.839 --> 25:40.887
And you're willing to
say that on the stand?

25:40.930 --> 25:43.846
I guess so.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.634
You seem a little uncertain.

25:48.677 --> 25:54.117
Um, no, I'm not... uncertain.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.903
It's just scary.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.513
But you don't have to be scared.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.472
I mean, he's your guy, right?

26:01.516 --> 26:03.736
You said you two live together.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.608
Yeah, and we sleep
together, too,

26:06.652 --> 26:11.221
but it's not like that.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.963
How do you mean?

26:14.007 --> 26:15.704
He's in construction.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.576
He makes good money.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.708
I'm a waitress.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.231
Do the math.

26:21.275 --> 26:24.539
I mean, let's be honest.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.977
I don't think a lot of girls
are offering to sleep with him.

26:28.021 --> 26:30.066
A girl wants a guy
who will listen to her,

26:30.110 --> 26:32.373
but... once in a while

26:32.416 --> 26:35.115
you want him
to say something back.

26:40.120 --> 26:44.603
So, um... are we done?
I have to get back to work.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.301
Sure.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.172
You want taxi money
or subway money?

26:49.216 --> 26:51.784
I'm fine. Um...

26:51.827 --> 26:55.048
When is it you need me
to do this thing?

26:55.091 --> 26:59.226
Y-You know what, we
may not even call you.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.532
The trial could go a
hundred different ways,

27:01.576 --> 27:03.709
but I promise to keep in touch.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.502
How long have you lived

27:14.545 --> 27:15.697
down the block
from the Johnsons?

27:15.721 --> 27:16.872
Gosh. Since their little girl

27:16.896 --> 27:18.941
started elementary school
with mine.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.640
I guess it's been six years now.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.208
Can you tell us
what you saw that night?

27:25.252 --> 27:29.691
I was taking our dog out
for a walk, same as every night.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.955
Around 7:00. It was dark.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.131
And I heard this strange ring.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.959
I wasn't sure what it was.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.874
Then I realized
it was a smoke alarm

27:38.918 --> 27:40.789
and I looked across the street
at the Johnsons

27:40.833 --> 27:43.096
and there was this man
coming out the front door.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.924
And did you get
a good look at him?

27:44.967 --> 27:47.491
If you saw him again, do you
think you could identify him?

27:47.535 --> 27:48.579
Of course.

27:48.623 --> 27:49.903
He's right there. The defendant.

27:50.973 --> 27:54.542
He was running out of the front
of the house.

27:54.585 --> 27:55.867
Confidence metrics for this
woman are really high.

27:55.891 --> 27:56.936
The jury loves her.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.546
I don't love her. Next thing I knew,

27:58.589 --> 28:00.548
he was getting in the car
and driving off.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.289
This man?

28:03.769 --> 28:04.857
Yes, this man.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.816
Thank you.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.906
No further questions.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.952
Benny.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.653
Mrs. O'Neil, thank you so much

28:18.697 --> 28:19.915
for being with us here today.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.962
Now, today is not the first time

28:23.005 --> 28:25.138
that you have
identified my client

28:25.181 --> 28:28.750
as the man you saw making his
way out of the burning house.

28:28.794 --> 28:29.620
Isn't that correct?

28:29.664 --> 28:31.666
No. No, of course not.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.755
After the fire occurred,
the police asked me

28:33.799 --> 28:36.758
to come down to the precinct,
had me look at some photos.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.586
They wanted to see
if I recognized anyone.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.196
And did you?

28:40.240 --> 28:41.632
Of course.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.938
I saw his photo. There he was.

28:42.982 --> 28:45.985
So, how long
after the fire occurred

28:46.028 --> 28:48.422
was this visit to the precinct?

28:48.465 --> 28:50.076
I think it was a week or so.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.599
A week or so?

28:51.642 --> 28:53.601
And Mr. Miles
was arrested, what,

28:53.644 --> 28:55.646
three days after the crime?

28:55.690 --> 28:57.779
I-I really don't know.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.651
But I'm sure like most of us,

29:00.695 --> 29:02.784
you tried to find out everything
you could about it.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.656
I mean, you lived
across the street.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.658
Two people had died.

29:07.702 --> 29:11.314
My little girl played with Emma
every day after school.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.925
I was devastated. We all were.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.841
Well, then I'm sure you're aware
that after he was arrested,

29:15.884 --> 29:18.757
Mr. Miles's face was
all over the news,

29:18.800 --> 29:21.977
the TV, the Internet,
the newspapers,

29:22.021 --> 29:24.501
and this was three days
before you identified him.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.808
I guess that's right.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.158
Your Honor, while we
absolutely believe

29:29.202 --> 29:31.639
that the witness's testimony
was well-meaning,

29:31.682 --> 29:33.182
we'd like to make a motion
to suppress it.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.424
On what grounds?

29:34.468 --> 29:35.817
Isn't it obvious?

29:35.861 --> 29:38.733
The witness's identification
is suggestive;

29:38.777 --> 29:41.910
Therefore, tainted
and ultimately of no value.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.782
The witness chose
my client's photo

29:43.825 --> 29:46.132
because she had seen it
countless times,

29:46.175 --> 29:49.831
had been told countless times
on the TV, computer,

29:49.875 --> 29:51.746
in the newspapers
that this was the guy.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.965
Through no fault of her own

29:53.008 --> 29:53.966
or the government's.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.619
It's not about fault.

29:55.663 --> 29:58.753
It's about asking the jury to
consider what actually matters.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.407
We're talking
about a man's life here.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.386
Both sides make
compelling arguments

30:03.410 --> 30:05.325
in regard
to the witness's testimony;

30:05.368 --> 30:07.675
Therefore, I'm going
to leave it to the jury

30:07.718 --> 30:10.809
to determine how to evaluate the
strength of the identification.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.115
Your motion is denied.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.903
No further questions,
Your Honor.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.564
Nice work.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.704
Hey. I was thinking
about what you said.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.706
I want to have a quick
conference with Elliot.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.100
You have a minute?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.710
I've been remiss

30:42.753 --> 30:44.581
and thankfully, Mr. Colón

30:44.625 --> 30:45.825
has called it to my attention.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.935
The AUSA came to me
earlier this morning

30:49.978 --> 30:52.851
and offered to take the
death penalty off the table.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.384
"Why would he do that?"

31:04.427 --> 31:06.647
Well, he's offering
to do it in exchange

31:06.690 --> 31:07.822
for you admitting guilt

31:07.866 --> 31:09.911
and saving the government
the trouble

31:09.955 --> 31:11.652
of putting on this trial.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.706
"But I didn't do it."

31:22.750 --> 31:23.925
We know.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.753
But we needed to tell you
about the offer.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.798
We also need to tell you...

31:27.842 --> 31:29.080
And Dr. Bull,
feel free to jump in

31:29.104 --> 31:31.933
if I say something
you don't agree with...

31:31.977 --> 31:33.152
We could use your help.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.936
The fella who sold you the car,

31:34.980 --> 31:36.609
is there anything else
you can tell us about him?

31:36.633 --> 31:39.419
Your description
was pretty... general.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.171
A limp?

31:52.214 --> 31:55.217
Suddenly the guy who sold him
the car has a limp?

31:55.261 --> 31:57.437
Come on. I'm sorry, Bull.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.960
It all sounds like a bad novel.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.919
It does, doesn't it?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.400
You okay?

32:07.447 --> 32:11.103
Actually, I'm a mess
'cause I know he's innocent.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.410
I know it with every fiber
of my being.

32:14.454 --> 32:18.719
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard this morning.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.329
I'm worried about you.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.983
We all are.

32:22.027 --> 32:25.987
You've always been this rock,

32:26.031 --> 32:28.947
the guy who knows the answer
before anyone asks the question.

32:28.990 --> 32:33.821
It seems like
you're coming apart.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.823
Is it Izzy?

32:35.866 --> 32:36.867
Izzy getting married?

32:36.911 --> 32:40.436
No, I'm fine.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.961
Trust me, I am fine.

33:00.891 --> 33:04.025
Who is it?

33:04.069 --> 33:06.419
Ghost of Christmas Past.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.034
My goodness.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.038
I'm tempted to say "look
what the cat dragged in,"

33:17.082 --> 33:18.537
but given your current
weight, I don't think

33:18.561 --> 33:20.868
there's a cat in this
town that can do the job.

33:21.912 --> 33:24.132
It's nice to see you, too.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.005
God, I'm awful.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.746
Do you want to come in?

33:36.927 --> 33:38.929
You... you want a drink?

33:38.973 --> 33:41.367
Yes. God, yes.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.630
But don't give me one.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.895
It's nice.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.289
You want to buy it?
I'm getting married.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.117
I heard.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.033
I wanted to tell you.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.686
Um, I called...

33:56.730 --> 33:59.559
but you were never
there, so I...

33:59.602 --> 34:03.041
I figured it was a sign.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.607
No.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.305
It's all good.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.309
I'm happy for you.

34:10.351 --> 34:12.485
You don't look happy.

34:12.527 --> 34:15.139
Happy for you; Sad for me.

34:17.141 --> 34:19.708
You're a great lady, lady.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.973
Is that what you came
over here to tell me?

34:23.016 --> 34:27.108
I don't know what
I came over here to tell you.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.545
Benny and I are
representing this guy...

34:30.590 --> 34:33.201
who's staring
at the death penalty.

34:33.245 --> 34:36.639
Yeah, the fire guy...
My brother told me.

34:36.683 --> 34:40.078
Has a way of making you
think about things.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.123
Think about life.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.212
About your own life.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.956
I'm sorry.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.960
I'm sorry it didn't...

34:54.004 --> 34:56.005
work for us.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.535
I would have really liked...

35:02.578 --> 35:05.015
for it to have worked.

35:08.584 --> 35:12.066
But I'm glad you found someone.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.113
I wish the same for you.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.639
Can I tell you something?

35:19.682 --> 35:22.859
Something I don't think
you know about yourself?

35:25.819 --> 35:29.127
I don't think you're
good alone, Jason.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.782
I don't.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.395
You may be onto something there.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.182
Anyway...

35:42.836 --> 35:44.359
Have a wonderful wedding

35:44.403 --> 35:47.145
and an amazing marriage and...

35:47.188 --> 35:48.972
great life.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.541
You, too.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.512
Mr. Wilson,
did your construction crew

36:06.555 --> 36:08.992
work on a jobsite
at 68-8 Peak Street,

36:09.036 --> 36:11.212
an apartment house? Yes, sir.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.693
And was Elliot Miles
a part of that crew?

36:13.736 --> 36:16.739
He was. Elliot's been
on every crew I've had

36:16.783 --> 36:18.567
for nearly three years.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.222
He's a good worker
and a very good roofer.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.745
And from the roof

36:22.789 --> 36:25.095
of that building,
could one possibly see

36:25.139 --> 36:27.924
the Johnson residence?

36:27.968 --> 36:29.578
I object, Your Honor.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.580
Calls for speculation.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.515
There's nothing speculative
about it, Your Honor.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.193
If you'd allow me to continue,

36:35.236 --> 36:37.020
that will become
absolutely clear.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.457
Objection overruled.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.068
Your Honor, I'd like
to show the jury

36:41.111 --> 36:42.635
prosecution 27.

36:42.678 --> 36:45.899
These are photos taken from
the roof of 68-8 Peak Street.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.641
Clearly visible and circled
is the victims' house.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.168
Mr. Wilson,
doesn't it stand to reason

36:54.212 --> 36:57.650
that your employee might well
have been watching Mrs. Johnson?

36:57.693 --> 36:59.042
Learned her comings and goings,

36:59.086 --> 37:02.220
seeing when she
might be vulnerable?

37:02.263 --> 37:04.657
Objection!
Your Honor, again, speculation.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.267
The witness can't testify

37:06.311 --> 37:08.835
to what my client did
or didn't see.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.750
Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.492
No further questions,
Your Honor.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.754
Gentlemen.

37:14.797 --> 37:18.279
Something to chew on
with your lunch.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.325
New witness list.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.288
Lily Galloway?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.638
Isn't that Elliot's girlfriend?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.988
Isn't... she testifying for us?

37:32.032 --> 37:34.904
I sure thought so.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.690
The meeting did not go well... she
was kind of all over the place.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.909
But... I get
the definite impression

37:39.953 --> 37:43.435
that any romantic feelings
reside strictly with Elliot.

37:43.478 --> 37:46.742
She seems to be in it
mostly for economic reasons.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.875
So, how would you
describe your relationship

37:48.918 --> 37:50.746
with the accused?

37:50.790 --> 37:53.401
I guess you could say
I'm his girlfriend.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.839
And where were you
on the night of the murders?

37:56.883 --> 37:59.886
I was at our apartment
in Astoria.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.715
I got there
after my shift ended at 4:00.

38:02.758 --> 38:05.457
I wait tables in Kew Gardens.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.851
We usually...
make dinner together.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.984
And what time did Elliot
get home that night?

38:11.027 --> 38:13.073
He was late.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.902
He said he was running
some errands for his boss.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.992
Now, you originally told
the police it was about 8:15,

38:19.035 --> 38:20.646
is that correct?

38:21.690 --> 38:23.344
Yes. That's right.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.651
But now I think...

38:25.694 --> 38:27.653
I might have been mistaken.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.872
I think it might have been 9:15.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.831
What?

38:33.049 --> 38:34.244
Now, when you say you "think..."

38:34.268 --> 38:35.791
No. I meant...

38:35.835 --> 38:38.707
I know... it was 9:15.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.841
It was definitely 9:15.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.931
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.153
Miss Galloway...

38:50.197 --> 38:52.155
I appreciate your testimony,

38:52.199 --> 38:54.636
but I am confused.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.901
I read the police transcripts
of your interview with them.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.904
You're very clear, very certain.

39:01.948 --> 39:05.865
You said Elliot walked
through the door at 8:15.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.867
I know that's what I said.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.391
Now, the interview was
less than three days

39:10.435 --> 39:11.827
after the fire.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.743
Your recollection was
still fresh in your head.

39:14.787 --> 39:17.920
You said you were certain
what time it was.

39:17.964 --> 39:21.054
Now here we are,
weeks and weeks later,

39:21.097 --> 39:23.404
and-and you're insisting
that you were off

39:23.448 --> 39:25.275
by a whole hour?

39:25.319 --> 39:28.017
How do you explain that?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.457
Miss Galloway?

39:34.197 --> 39:36.374
The witness will answer
the question, please.

39:44.904 --> 39:48.864
I actually have no idea
what time Elliot got home.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.304
Well, that sure
woke the jury up.

39:54.348 --> 39:57.917
I'm sorry, did... did you
just say you have no idea?

39:57.960 --> 40:01.877
I worked that day
from 8:00 until 4:00.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.836
By the time Elliot got home,

40:03.879 --> 40:06.839
I was thoroughly trashed.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.058
Okay.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.233
Now...

40:10.277 --> 40:12.888
when you say
you were "trashed..."

40:12.932 --> 40:15.978
I had smoked some bath salts.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.373
We just got our first green.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.853
You just testified

40:20.896 --> 40:23.333
that the defendant
got home at 9:15.

40:23.377 --> 40:26.075
People were really
angry with me.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.948
They knew I lived with Elliot.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.080
At work, they
wouldn't speak to me.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.518
In the neighborhood,
they wrote bad words

40:33.561 --> 40:35.781
on my car with white paint.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.261
He said he'd get me protection.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.307
Who said they'd get
you protection?

40:41.917 --> 40:45.094
Let the record show
that the witness is pointing

40:45.138 --> 40:47.488
to the prosecuting attorney,
the AUSA.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.665
Now... are you saying
that the federal prosecutor

40:50.709 --> 40:52.754
offered you protection

40:52.798 --> 40:54.887
in return for saying
that my client got home

40:54.930 --> 40:57.019
at 9:15 instead of 8:15?

40:57.063 --> 40:59.935
Objection! The defense
is trying create an inference

40:59.979 --> 41:01.284
that something untoward...

41:01.328 --> 41:03.069
Something untoward?

41:03.112 --> 41:05.419
The witness just testified
that you bribed her.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.962
Your Honor, I object.
You offered the witness

41:06.986 --> 41:09.118
a promise, inducement...
There was no formal promise.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.337
Or reward.Mr. Rosenberg!

41:10.380 --> 41:12.644
And if that's the case,
the prosecutor knows

41:12.687 --> 41:14.559
as well as I do
that it's his duty

41:14.602 --> 41:16.212
to disclose that to the defense!

41:16.256 --> 41:18.563
I move for a mistrial,
Your Honor! Order.

41:18.606 --> 41:20.410
The defense moves... I really don't think
she's marriage material,

41:20.434 --> 41:22.654
but that girl may have
just saved your life.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.307
I will have order.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.270
There will be no mistrial.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.708
I think it's fairly obvious

41:33.752 --> 41:36.102
that the witness has,
for all intents and purposes,

41:36.145 --> 41:37.582
recanted any statements
having to do

41:37.625 --> 41:41.107
with the precise times
or whereabouts of the accused.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.477
And I have every confidence that
the jury can determine what,

41:43.501 --> 41:46.547
if any value
her testimony has provided.

41:46.591 --> 41:47.853
The witness is dismissed,

41:47.896 --> 41:49.681
and court is adjourned
until tomorrow.

41:56.165 --> 41:59.168
I may have been a touch
premature about your girlfriend,

41:59.212 --> 42:02.128
but... we live to
fight another day.

42:15.097 --> 42:18.144
What was it you guys
just signed to each other?

42:19.885 --> 42:21.843
"You are not alone."

42:21.887 --> 42:23.802
Wow. I'm impressed.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.586
What possessed you
to learn that?

42:25.630 --> 42:27.457
To say that to him?

42:27.501 --> 42:29.895
You've got it backwards.

42:29.938 --> 42:32.811
He keeps saying it to me.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.987
Hey.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.989
I tried my best, boss.

42:37.032 --> 42:40.340
No, you were
a pit bull out there.

42:40.383 --> 42:44.474
Any other judge, and we'd be
toasting each other right now.

42:46.085 --> 42:48.261
God, what a good idea.

42:50.089 --> 42:53.092
Sorry to let everybody down...

42:53.135 --> 42:56.138
but I think I need a drink.
