01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:43.043
- I didn't touch her, Grey.

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:48.396
When did it start happening,
the transformation?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.311
- She knew what I was.

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:55.273
She saw me and she
came back for me.

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:59.756
I want you dead like her.

01:14:59.843 --> 01:15:02.454

You wanna shoot me?

01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:12.508

01:15:14.814 --> 01:15:16.381
- I don't think so.

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:18.992
I didn't.

01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:25.869

of us are there?

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.549

01:15:58.379 --> 01:16:00.425
Grey, don't. Grey, don't.

have you killed?

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:23.579
- [Vaughn] I prefer to
think of it as culling.

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:27.670
There are too many people,
and not enough predators.

01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:40.438
You suffered this
enormous trauma.

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:44.050
I, [chuckles] I don't
think you appreciate-

01:17:44.137 --> 01:17:45.095

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.410

by rabid animal,

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.848

Well, I think this would
be the sort of thing

that you would recall,
don't you think, no?

01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:31.402

any hallucinations lately.
