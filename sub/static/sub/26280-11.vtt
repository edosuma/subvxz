WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:04.613
Champagne, a champagne,

00:04.656 --> 00:08.573
a champagne
with a packet of Splenda in it.

00:08.617 --> 00:11.576
You know what I call this drink?A waste of champagne?

00:11.620 --> 00:13.926
No. A Dr. Cooper.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.407
Because...

00:16.451 --> 00:18.931
He'’s alsosweet and bubbly.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.934
All right.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.415
A... a toast
to Sheldon and Amy

00:24.459 --> 00:26.722
and the publication
of your super-asymmetry paper.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.767
We are so proud of you guys.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.031
Cheers.
Thanks.
Yay. Boom.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.122
Ooh! That is PhD-licious.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.213
So, have you guys gotten
any feedback yet?

00:39.256 --> 00:40.736
Well, there are
some comments online,

00:40.779 --> 00:43.086
but we haven'’t read them.
We decided we don'’t care

00:43.130 --> 00:45.349
what people say
about our work.PENNY: Good for you.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.482
People online
can be so mean.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.440
I posted a picture of myself
on Instagram,

00:49.484 --> 00:52.226
and some jerk said I looked
so skinny I might disappear.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.533
And yet,
somehow she soldiers on.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.274
Mm.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.016
Although, Amy and I did
give the world a gift.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.106
It would be nice to read
some of the thank-you notes.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.109
I'’m surprised you're interested
in some stranger'’s opinion.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.546
Well, as I always say,
a stranger'’s just a friend

01:08.590 --> 01:10.070
who hasn'’t complimented me yet.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.507
AMY:
Okay.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.204
I'’ll read them.If any of them

01:14.248 --> 01:17.512
accuse you of being too pretty,
Penny can help you through it.

01:19.122 --> 01:23.866
Okay, here'’s one
from Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.824
Wait, no, stop.
I don'’t want to know.
What if he'’s mean?

01:25.868 --> 01:27.435
Well, what if
he'’s complimentary?

01:27.478 --> 01:29.393
I want to know.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.439
Okay. He says...

01:31.482 --> 01:33.049
I don'’t want to know.All right,
just...

01:33.093 --> 01:34.572
let me see it.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.272
Okay, this is...
this is really positive.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.795
Wow, it'’s,

01:39.838 --> 01:41.188
like, reallypositive.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.495
He says it might be
the discovery of the decade.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.629
He'’s right.
They love it!

01:47.672 --> 01:49.065
This is so exciting.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.154
Oh, this may be the
Dr. Cooper talking,

01:51.198 --> 01:52.982
but pour me
another Dr. Cooper.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.231
Hey, Penny and I
were thinking of getting

02:24.274 --> 02:25.754
a big paintball game together.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.582
[groans]: Oh, Leonard,
why does she want

02:27.625 --> 02:29.845
to shoot you?

02:29.888 --> 02:31.325
She doesn'’t want to shoot me.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.674
Who doesn'’t want to shoot you?Penny.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.154
No, that doesn'’t sound right.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.461
She just wants
to play paintball.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.333
It combines my love of whimsy

02:39.376 --> 02:41.987
with her love
of making grown men cry.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.381
Sounds fun.
Bernadette and I are in.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.079
You don'’t need to ask her?No. I'’ve been pretty
annoying lately.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.212
She'’s gonna want
to shoot me.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.648
Dr. Cooper.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.084
Ah, President Siebert.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.956
What are you doing
in the regular cafeteria?

02:53.999 --> 02:55.305
You'’re a superstar.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.307
No offense, worker bees.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.179
SIEBERT: You should join me
in my private dining room.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.398
Dr. Fowler is already there.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.791
Can I bring my friends?

03:02.834 --> 03:05.402
No.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.230
Can I bring my tater tots?Yes.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.276
All right, let'’s go.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.280
Welcome to
the inner sanctum.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.586
Oh, I do love
a good sanctum.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.547
Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.
It'’s got kiwi on it.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.157
Ugh. I don'’t like kiwi.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.334
Neither do I, but it'’s so fancy.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.683
Well, this is nice.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.033
Why have we waited
so long to do this?

03:28.077 --> 03:30.645
Because you
never invited us.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.256
Ha-ha-ha!

03:33.300 --> 03:36.259
Well, the important thing
is you'’re here now,

03:36.303 --> 03:38.000
and we'’re so excited
about your work.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.350
This paper'’s going to do
big things for all of us,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.047
so if there'’s anything
that you need...

03:42.091 --> 03:44.485
You know, actually, I could use
some barbecue sauce for my tots.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.313
Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.229
Can we have some barbecue
sauce and ketchup over here?

03:49.272 --> 03:51.187
Both?

03:52.362 --> 03:54.234
So this is how
the other half lives.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.455
I just want you to know
that you have our full support,

03:58.499 --> 04:00.544
and we'’re organizing
a big media push.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.285
Articles.
Interviews.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.418
Oh, you want us
to do interviews?

04:04.461 --> 04:07.159
Well, we'’re thinking
a divide-and-conquer
approach here,

04:07.203 --> 04:08.639
where you do the interviews,

04:08.683 --> 04:11.642
and Sheldon stays here
and holds down the fort.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.427
You know...

04:13.470 --> 04:14.819
in case there'’s an emergency.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.692
What kind of an emergency
would there be in physics?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.998
I don'’t know, maybe there's
an object in motion

04:20.042 --> 04:21.478
that won'’t stay in motion.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.958
Or a reaction

04:23.001 --> 04:24.916
that'’s equal but not opposite.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.354
It sounds like

04:27.397 --> 04:30.270
you don'’t want Sheldon
to do the interviews.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.489
It'’s not that we don't want
Sheldonto do the interviews,

04:32.533 --> 04:34.361
it'’s just that we really
want youto do the interviews.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.538
Without Sheldon.[stammers]

04:37.581 --> 04:39.148
Now, wait, wait,

04:39.191 --> 04:40.932
are you trying
to exclude me?

04:40.976 --> 04:42.499
Look, Sheldon,
you'’re a brilliant man,

04:42.543 --> 04:44.240
but your people skills are...

04:44.284 --> 04:45.850
This is not barbecue sauce!

04:45.894 --> 04:47.678
This is steak sauce!
What are you trying to pull?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
Like that.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.681
This is ridiculous.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.293
It is my work, too,
and I am perfectly capable

04:53.336 --> 04:55.469
of keeping it together
for an interview.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.559
Okay. Say somebody asks
if you feel your work

04:58.602 --> 05:02.171
is derivative of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski.

05:11.354 --> 05:14.314
Seriously, can we get
this man some barbecue sauce!?

05:17.665 --> 05:19.667
Would you mind stocking these?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.538
Actually, I'’m not
on the clock today.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.192
I'’m just hanging out
with my boyfriend.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.150
Ah, cool. Huh.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.848
That'’s me, right?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.545
Oh, I forgot to tell you--

05:28.589 --> 05:30.591
I broke up with you,
and now I'’m

05:30.634 --> 05:33.463
dating... that guy.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.030
I know you'’re joking,

05:35.073 --> 05:38.076
but my flight-or-flight
response doesn'’t.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.078
Isn'’t it fight-or-flight?

05:40.122 --> 05:42.733
Not for me.

05:42.777 --> 05:45.170
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.824
This is our wedding,

05:46.868 --> 05:48.173
and if anyone'’s gonna design
the floral arrangements,

05:48.217 --> 05:51.307
it'’s going to be my man.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.874
Thank you.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.398
I mean, I-I'’m not trying
to be a groomzilla,

05:55.442 --> 05:58.140
but... this is my specialty.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.448
[phone rings]

06:01.491 --> 06:02.971
Someone texting you?

06:03.014 --> 06:04.407
Uh, no. It'’s just my,

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
uh, doorbell camera.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.412
Oh. I got one of those for my
place, but I never installed it.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.066
Oh, it'’s easy.
I can do it for you.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.807
You'’re gonna love it.
It'’s how I found out

06:12.850 --> 06:16.158
a raccoon was stealing my
cheese-of-the-month club.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.507
What did you do?

06:17.551 --> 06:19.509
Nothing. I didn'’t
want to piss it off.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.206
It was, like, huge from
eating all the cheese.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.341
Hey. We'’re doing a big
paintball game on Saturday

06:25.385 --> 06:26.951
if you two want to join.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.953
Oh, my roommate asked me to
help her move out on Saturday.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.651
Ugh. That sucks.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.217
Sucks for her.
I'’m playing paintball.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.221
I-I didn'’t know
your roommate was moving out.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.180
Yeah. I'’ve been looking
for a new one,

06:38.223 --> 06:40.617
but... so far no luck.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.097
You hear that?

06:42.140 --> 06:44.621
She needs a roommate.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.276
[mumbling]

06:48.538 --> 06:50.279
[mumbling]

06:52.281 --> 06:54.239
What do you think, Stuart?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.241
[mumbling]:
Uh, i-i-it, uh...

06:56.285 --> 06:58.200
Flight.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.419
Flight.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.991
That was hard to watch.Yeah.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.912
Okay, I need you to
be honest with me.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
How do I look?

07:19.526 --> 07:22.616
A little shorter, but as we age
that happens to all of us.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.487
Come on, help me out here.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.011
I'’ve got a bunch
of interviews today.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.319
Well, no one'’ll notice.
They never met you before.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.321
Sheldon, I'’m nervous,

07:32.364 --> 07:34.192
and I wish you were
coming with me.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.891
If it helps, I wrote up
some possible questions

07:36.934 --> 07:38.240
and answers for you.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.548
"Whom do you love more,

07:41.591 --> 07:44.942
"Sheldon the scientist
or Sheldon the man?

07:46.727 --> 07:48.642
"Answer: Sheldon
the scientist,

07:48.685 --> 07:52.036
but by such a slim margin
that it'’s statistically
insignificant."

07:53.516 --> 07:57.041
Well, you really managed
to capture my voice.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.956
Well, don'’t worry.
I'’m sure you're gonna do great.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.610
Thank you.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.438
Okay, bye.Wait-wait-wait.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.788
You forgot the cards.Love you, too.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.272
Really? She asked you
to move in with her?

08:10.315 --> 08:11.578
Yeah, she was

08:11.621 --> 08:12.840
hinting around about it,

08:12.883 --> 08:15.059
but I think I handled it
pretty well.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.758
"Pretty well"?

08:17.801 --> 08:20.674
You ran out of there so fast,
if it was a cartoon,

08:20.717 --> 08:23.328
there would have been a
Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.940
Was she mad?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.550
Uh, no. I talked to her after.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.030
She said she'’s fine.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.293
Oh, no.
Yikes!You'’ll find someone new.

08:32.424 --> 08:33.600
[phone rings]

08:33.643 --> 08:35.297
Everything okay?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.951
Yeah, it'’s just
Anu'’s doorbell camera.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.387
I helped her install it.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.128
You can'’t look at it.
That'’s spying.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.564
Who the hell is this guy?

08:41.608 --> 08:42.391
Ooh, let me see.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.526
He'’s got... bags.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.049
He'’s probably
just delivering food.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.574
Why is she hugging him?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.358
Maybe she doesn'’t
have tip money?

08:55.491 --> 08:57.928
W-Wait, why is she
inviting him into the house?

08:57.972 --> 09:00.278
She'’s a good tipper?

09:02.846 --> 09:06.328
Do you ever feel guilty
that we get to eat

09:06.371 --> 09:09.157
in the fancy dining room
while our friends have to
eat in the regular one?

09:09.200 --> 09:12.813
Yes. Wait, did you say
"guilty" or "happy"?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.466
"Guilty."

09:14.510 --> 09:16.643
Oh, then no.

09:16.686 --> 09:20.385
In fact, take a picture
of me with the garlic
knots to send them.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.213
There'’s my MVP--

09:22.257 --> 09:24.041
Most Valuable Physicist.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.608
[chuckles]:
Thank you.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.697
And my star
of NPR Science Friday

09:27.741 --> 09:30.831
and a potpourri
of popular podcasts.

09:30.874 --> 09:34.704
I don'’t know if I'd
use the word "star."

09:34.748 --> 09:37.838
I would. I got an early look at
the interview you did for Wired,

09:37.881 --> 09:40.101
and it is glowing.
They loved you.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.755
That'’s great.
Thanks for telling me.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.973
Congratulations, Amy.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.932
I'’m so proud of you.And that headline--

09:44.975 --> 09:47.891
"The Neurobiologist
Who Revolutionized Physics."

09:47.935 --> 09:50.938
I'’m sorry.
The who who did what to-- huh?

09:59.555 --> 10:01.688
Oh, hey,
how did your interview go?

10:01.731 --> 10:03.559
Okay, I guess.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.126
You don'’t sound
very happy.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.606
Oh, why wouldn'’t
she be happy?

10:06.649 --> 10:08.999
She'’s the neurobiologist
who revolutionized physics.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.002
Sorry.

10:12.046 --> 10:15.658
This should be fun.
I'’ve never played before.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.834
Oh, fair warning-- it can
get pretty ugly out there.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.097
Okay, well, remember,
I'’m your fiancée.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.491
[laughing]:
Oh, I remember. Do you?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.494
All right, we need two teams.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.017
Who wants to be the captain?

10:27.061 --> 10:28.366
Oh, me.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.107
Uh, sure.
Why not?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.761
All right, why don'’t
you pick first?

10:31.805 --> 10:34.372
Okay, um... Leonard.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.158
Yeah?

10:37.201 --> 10:38.507
No, I'’m picking you.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.031
First? For a team?

10:41.075 --> 10:44.469
What is happening?

10:44.513 --> 10:47.385
All right,
I take Bernadette.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.866
Really?
You'’re picking her over me?

10:49.910 --> 10:52.652
Yeah, '’cause she's vicious
and can hide behind a mushroom.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.785
Um... Sheldon.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.353
PENNY:
Raj.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.355
DENISE:
Amy.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.530
PENNY:
I'’ll take Anu.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.362
Howard.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.539
All rightie.

11:10.582 --> 11:14.238
Come on, pick me, pick me.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.414
I will take... Stuart!

11:16.458 --> 11:17.677
Yes!

11:20.854 --> 11:22.290
Okay, guys, we
need some people

11:22.333 --> 11:24.074
to stay here and
guard the flag

11:24.118 --> 11:25.859
and some people to move out
and try to capture theirs.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.643
Okay. Sheldon,
do you want to stay here and...?

11:27.687 --> 11:28.905
What? Hold down the fort?
'’Cause that's all I'’m good for.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.080
Is that what you
were going to say?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.908
You know
that'’s not what he meant.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.040
Oh, why don'’t
you go out there?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.215
Maybe you'’ll be
the neurobiologist

11:34.258 --> 11:35.564
who revolutionizes
paintball.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.132
Stop it.
You'’re being ridiculous.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.612
Am I? Maybe it'’s just
my poor people skills.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.920
Oh, it'’s definitely
your poor people skills.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.966
All right, the choices are--
get shot at

11:46.009 --> 11:47.532
or stay here
and listen to them fight.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.405
LEONARD and DENISE and WOLOWITZ:
Shot at.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.102
[distant shooting]

11:53.974 --> 11:55.627
[grunts, pants]

11:55.671 --> 11:58.413
This is pretty exciting,
sneaking around like this.

11:58.456 --> 12:02.156
Oh, so you like sneaking around.
Good to know.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.158
What'’s that
supposed to mean?

12:04.201 --> 12:05.899
Nothing. Never mind.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.901
Let me see
if the coast is clear.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.604
See anybody?Yes, I saw a strange man going
into your house the other night!

12:15.647 --> 12:17.649
What?

12:17.693 --> 12:19.564
But out there,
there'’s nobody.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.052
[panting]

12:30.053 --> 12:31.838
Ow!

12:31.881 --> 12:33.709
I'’m hit.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.798
[paintball shot]Ow!

12:35.842 --> 12:37.887
I said I was hit!

12:37.931 --> 12:38.758
Sorry.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.674
Ow!

12:42.718 --> 12:44.764
Why do you keep shooting me?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.809
Why don'’t you want
to move in with me?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
I-I didn'’t say I didn't want to.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.901
No, you just ran away.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.511
Stuart?

12:55.035 --> 12:56.819
Stuart?!

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
Did you run away again?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.780
STUART
[in distance]: No!

13:01.868 --> 13:04.174
Bang, you'’re out.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.611
What?! I'’m not out.

13:06.655 --> 13:07.830
You didn'’t even shoot me.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.179
I'’m not gonna shoot you
from right here.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.441
It'’s too close.
It'’s gonna hurt.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.792
Oh, come on. It'’s not
gonna hurt that bad.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.229
I'’m telling you, from
this distance it'’s gonna... Ow!

13:15.272 --> 13:17.753
See? That hurt!

13:17.797 --> 13:20.234
All right. Fine,
you can shoot me.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.801
No, I'’m not gonna shoot you.
Ow!

13:23.846 --> 13:25.630
Ow! Ow!

13:25.674 --> 13:28.633
Aah, you were right.
We'’re way too close.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.113
See, I told you
it'’s gonna hurt...

13:30.157 --> 13:32.376
Ow!

13:32.420 --> 13:34.465
I can'’t believe
you'’re taking this out on me.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.990
I was just trying to get
publicity for ourpaper.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.948
By making it seem
like it was your idea?

13:38.992 --> 13:41.429
I didn'’t write the headline,
Sheldon.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.865
Did you even read the article?

13:42.909 --> 13:45.128
Because I talk
about you continuously.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.088
I know, and it just made you
sound modest and charming.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.963
AMY:
Why can'’t you just
be proud of me?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.270
I am proud of you.

13:56.313 --> 13:59.055
Really?
Because you sound jealous.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.014
Well, I'’m that, too.
I'’ve seen Inside Out.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.146
I know I can feel
two things at once.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.890
Ow!
Ow!

14:07.934 --> 14:10.850
Well, now I feel
three things.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.855
Hey.

14:15.898 --> 14:16.856
Who shot you?

14:16.899 --> 14:19.162
Oh. Uh, oh...

14:19.206 --> 14:22.165
Denise, uh, Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise,

14:22.209 --> 14:23.688
Denise, Denise, Denise,

14:23.732 --> 14:26.039
Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise

14:26.082 --> 14:28.868
and me when I was running
from Denise.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.914
What is up with you two?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.177
Well, it'’s kind of
hard to explain. Uh,

14:34.221 --> 14:37.137
you know when things
are going great, but you worry

14:37.180 --> 14:39.269
that any minute
you might screw everything up?

14:39.313 --> 14:42.316
No.
Yes.

14:42.359 --> 14:45.319
If you really like her, you
can'’t let fear get in the way.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.147
You have to move forward.

14:47.190 --> 14:50.759
And at a certain point, the fear
of losing her goes away?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.326
I will let you know.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.113
You were spying on me?That is not the point.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.333
The point is who was that man?

14:59.376 --> 15:01.465
Fine. That was
my ex-boyfriend.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.598
Some of his stuff
was still at my house,

15:03.641 --> 15:05.426
and he stopped by
to pick it up.

15:05.469 --> 15:09.125
And did you give it to him?
Did you give him his stuff?

15:09.169 --> 15:13.956
If "stuff" means
sex, then no.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.351
If "stuff" means his
Waterpik, then yes!

15:17.394 --> 15:18.830
I got the flag!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.963
I'’m gonna make a run for it.
Cover me!

15:22.922 --> 15:26.360
So you'’re still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

15:26.403 --> 15:28.623
Yes, and I'’m not gonna
apologize for that.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.625
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.148
Because you'’re hiding
something from me?

15:32.192 --> 15:33.845
No, because you
should trust me!

15:33.889 --> 15:36.674
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!

15:39.329 --> 15:41.201
Then what are we doing?

15:41.244 --> 15:43.072
Why are we planning
a wedding?

15:43.116 --> 15:45.074
I don'’t know.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.035
[paintball hits]DENISE:
Aah,

15:49.078 --> 15:50.558
sad man!

15:54.866 --> 15:56.085
Ow!

15:56.129 --> 15:59.132
Ha, ha! Oh. It'’s you.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.698
I can'’t believe you shot me!

16:00.742 --> 16:01.917
I can'’t believe I did, either.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.788
Right in the chest.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.139
Sorry. That'’s gonna
leave a bruise.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.532
Yeah, a big one.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.752
Does it hurt?
A little.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.973
Want to kiss it
and make it better?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.844
I do.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.023
Where are you going?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.720
Home.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.985
Don'’t worry. I'll wave to
the doorbell when I get there.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.421
Wait, wait, wait.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.031
At least let me drive you.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.511
That'’s okay. I'll Uber.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.295
We can take you.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.428
Come on, Sheldon.Okay.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.996
But I should warn you,
we'’re in a bit of a spat.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.606
At least I think we are.
Amy, are we still in a spat?

16:38.649 --> 16:39.999
Are you ready to apologize?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.739
We are.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.789
Aha!WOLOWITZ:
Hey!

16:47.832 --> 16:49.791
BERNADETTE:
Get out!Sorry. Sorry.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.314
I didn'’t see anything.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.446
Actually, could I...?

16:52.489 --> 16:53.708
Ooh, thank you!

17:01.846 --> 17:05.589
Hey.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.765
Wow. That'’s a lot of bruises.

17:07.809 --> 17:12.031
Yeah, well,
you shot me a lot of times.

17:14.207 --> 17:17.732
That'’s not even counting
the bruises on the inside.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.168
'’Cause I hurt your feelings?

17:19.212 --> 17:22.911
Let'’s hope that's all it is.

17:22.954 --> 17:26.523
Ah, look, I'’m sorry
that I freaked out.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.918
It'’s just that things are
going so good with us,

17:29.961 --> 17:33.704
and I'’m afraid that if we go
too fast, I am gonna mess it up.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.968
I get that. I don'’t want
to mess things up, either.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.796
[sighs]

17:38.840 --> 17:41.930
Um, I got you something.

17:41.973 --> 17:46.543
It'’s a key to my place
to show you that I'’m serious.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.154
Thank you.Mm.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.025
Well, isn'’t this technically

17:50.069 --> 17:53.594
a key to Howard
and Bernadette'’s place?

17:53.637 --> 17:57.076
Yes, so don'’t ever use it or
let them know that you have it.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.252
Come here.Oh. Uh, no.

17:59.295 --> 18:03.821
I appreciate it, but
seriously, this is all bruise.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.562
Kiss?

18:05.606 --> 18:07.521
Gently.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.916
Ow.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.833
I'’m about to start recording.
Are you guys ready?

18:15.877 --> 18:17.879
Sheldon, are you ready?

18:17.922 --> 18:20.055
Absolutely.Great.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.014
So, Dr. Cooper,
my first question is for you.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.756
Oh, goody.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.019
Would you say that your paper
is an extension

18:28.063 --> 18:30.370
of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.129
I'’ll be in the car.
