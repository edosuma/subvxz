Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

00:31.980 --> 00:35.269
I was just about to ask you
the same question.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.056
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:03.643 --> 01:09.100
[BLACK PANTHER] I would prefer to avoid
unnecessary bloodshed in my palace garden.

01:11.350 --> 01:14.946
Yeah. Still working out
if it's unnecessary.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.059
Captain, this is White Wolf.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.639
He is a trusted member
of the royal family.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.309
I have recently tasked him
with helping Wakandan security.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.939
- Hunter, this is Captain...
- I know who he is.

01:26.940 --> 01:29.229
I want to know why he's here.

01:29.230 --> 01:32.479
I arranged a meeting
of Secret Avengers.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.479
Captain America was invited.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.759
But I wasn't.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.229
What's wrong with this picture?

01:38.230 --> 01:40.189
Brother, please.

01:40.190 --> 01:44.690
Fine. I'll just go make sure
everything is secure.

01:47.310 --> 01:50.349
[CAPTAIN AMERICA] I'll say this for your
brother, he takes the job seriously.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.309
Indeed.

been more secure.

02:41.270 --> 02:43.769
- He is on our side.
- What?

Is this any way to treat
your new teammate?

02:56.560 --> 03:01.349
Now, then, if you've finished with your
heroic display, please take a seat.

03:01.350 --> 03:03.730
You may learn something.

03:07.810 --> 03:11.309
There are three pieces
that form the Panther Key.

03:11.310 --> 03:14.309
Decades ago,
the previous Shadow Council

03:14.310 --> 03:17.309
tried to weaponize
a powerful Wakandan artifact

03:17.310 --> 03:21.689
but were thwarted by the Captain
here and your grandfather.

03:21.690 --> 03:24.809
Your grandfather hid
that artifact in a place

03:24.810 --> 03:28.899
that could only be accessed
via the so-called Panther's Key.

03:28.900 --> 03:33.349
Your grandfather then broke the key into
three sections and hid them as well,

03:33.350 --> 03:37.059
forcing Black Panther to scour the
world to retrieve the sections

03:37.060 --> 03:39.519
ahead of the modern Shadow Council.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.020
In that, he has been victorious.

03:44.055 --> 03:46.019
We now have the key here,

03:46.020 --> 03:49.139
safe in Wakanda, reassembled.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.189
The Shadow Council has nothing.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.479
But there is yet
another problem.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.599
We still don't know what the
key is supposed to open.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.309
Indeed, Princess Shuri.

03:59.310 --> 04:02.309
I have automated systems
searching my father's records.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.479
[BEEPING]

04:04.480 --> 04:07.349
Perhaps they will find
the answer there.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.519
In the meantime, the key will
be kept here, in the palace.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.899
My presentation is complete.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.900
Are there any... questions?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.810
[CLEARS THROAT]

04:22.270 --> 04:25.270
T'Challa, can I have a word,
in private?

04:28.270 --> 04:31.559
You're comfortable with Zemo
having access to the key?

04:31.560 --> 04:33.519
Zemo has been
a strong asset, Captain.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.349
He is under my protection.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.809
Do you know how many evil plots
and schemes he's hatched?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.269
How many times he's pretended
to be a hero just long enough

04:40.270 --> 04:42.600
until he can
stab us in the back?

04:47.659 --> 04:51.439
We are in my palace, in the
country where I am king.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.229
My back is well guarded.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.139
Zemo is a manipulator.

04:56.140 --> 04:59.019
If there's a way he can double-cross
an ally, he'll find it.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.349
I have made my judgment, Captain.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.940
- This discussion is...
- [THUD]

05:10.728 --> 05:13.019
Does Wakanda have blackouts?

05:13.020 --> 05:14.054
We do not.

05:14.079 --> 05:16.599
But emergency systems
should activate.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.479
Hmm. Odd.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.559
It's Zemo. He did this.
I warned you.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.559
Zemo could not have done this.
His access does not extend...

05:24.560 --> 05:26.189
It's Zemo.
We have to get outta here

05:26.190 --> 05:28.229
before he can finish
whatever it is he's planning.

05:28.230 --> 05:30.689
[GRUNTING]

05:30.690 --> 05:33.639
The palace doors require a
slight charge to pull them open.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.599
Without it, the doors become
an indestructible wall.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.599
It is a security feature.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.729
Okay, so we need to get
the doors powered up again.

05:40.730 --> 05:44.769
We do. The door control mechanism
is located inside this wall.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.480
Got it.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.599
- Shuri, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.779
I was in the east wing when
everything went into lockdown.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.149
But I did have to cut through
the wall to get out.

06:07.150 --> 06:10.149
We must find out how far
the blackout extends.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.359

No. I am quite sure
I did not tell you.

And I do not believe Shuri
would either.

let it slip at some point.

being kept in my chambers...

12:30.430 --> 12:31.969
myself and Shuri.

Zemo was not told,

12:33.600 --> 12:37.531
nor was Captain America
until moments ago.

Why would you do this?

Because of Father.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.099
I'm following his wishes.

You're betraying

Grandfather hid the key

Father kept it hidden,
kept it secret.
