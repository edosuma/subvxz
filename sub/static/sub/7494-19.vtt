WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.670
Last time on Make It Pop...

00:02.703 --> 00:05.106
Clean up and report to
detention tomorrow after school.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.440
I need my phone!!!

00:06.474 --> 00:07.841
I have a vision for the show.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.644
All the outfits will be pink,
and Dorothy will be a
cheerleader!

00:10.678 --> 00:12.513
We've worked too
hard for play to be taken
away from us!

00:12.546 --> 00:13.347
I don't want to talk to you.

00:13.381 --> 00:13.847
I'll do anything!

00:13.881 --> 00:14.782
Where do we start?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.117
We get rid of Valerie.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.153
So ho ho... we get
rid of Valerie,

00:19.187 --> 00:20.421
take back the play,

00:20.454 --> 00:22.423
make me the lead,
I become a star,

00:22.456 --> 00:24.625
forget to thank you
guys in my awards speech,

00:24.658 --> 00:29.630
we stop speaking, then
have a tearful reunion on TV.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.664
Is she all right?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.032
She can't help it.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.034
World domination
is her baseline.

00:34.068 --> 00:37.037
Did I mention the
play is in two days?

00:37.071 --> 00:37.938
We're too late.

00:37.971 --> 00:41.041
Too late?! Never!

00:41.075 --> 00:43.544
Was it too late when I
missed the deadline

00:43.577 --> 00:45.012
to transfer out
of chem class?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.547
Yes.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.915
But I did it.

00:47.948 --> 00:48.916
What?

00:48.949 --> 00:51.752
Was it too late to wear
white after Labor Day?

00:51.785 --> 00:52.886
Yes.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.524
But I rocked those open-toe
pumps on September 28th!

00:56.557 --> 00:57.591
Yes I did.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.459
Huh?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.828
And was it too late to
order breakfast

01:00.861 --> 01:02.896
in the caf at 11:30 am?

01:02.930 --> 01:03.664
Yes!

01:03.697 --> 01:05.065
But I lost that one,

01:05.099 --> 01:07.935
because the caf lady is very
strict about her "rules."

01:07.968 --> 01:10.671
But! This isn't about Oz!

01:10.704 --> 01:11.572
Or being right!

01:11.605 --> 01:12.806
Or even us!

01:12.840 --> 01:17.811
It's about protecting the great
value we have as a species!

01:17.845 --> 01:20.981
You do know that just because
you talk in an impassioned tone,

01:21.014 --> 01:23.050
it doesn't mean you're
making sense, right?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.585
*

01:24.618 --> 01:26.954
My audition was a disaster!

01:26.987 --> 01:28.589
I froze!

01:28.622 --> 01:30.691
Hands in jazz position.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.726
All they said was "next".

01:32.760 --> 01:35.463
Dismissed like a class at 3:30.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.697
That's a shame.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.499
I needed to feel rejection

01:38.532 --> 01:41.702
so I could finally
see my true calling:

01:41.735 --> 01:42.736
Monitoring the halls

01:42.770 --> 01:46.840
and teaching Theater Arts
at MacKendrick Prep.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.876
Let's just say it
never happened.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.711
I would love to say that.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.713
But if you say that,
then it happened.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.581
Right...

01:53.614 --> 01:55.616
So let's just say nothing.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.350
Okay.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.818
Remember though,
when the play--

01:57.851 --> 02:00.754
--IF the play fails,

02:00.788 --> 02:03.757
that theater becomes
a Diona-sized pool.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.161
Which you can clean, or
monitor halls elsewhere.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.663
I liked it better when
we were saying nothing.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.264
Okay.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.066
*

02:13.100 --> 02:14.768
We're taking back Oz!

02:14.802 --> 02:15.736
Who's with me?!

02:15.769 --> 02:16.770
I am.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.606
I'm a sucker for a
rallying speech.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.707
I agree!

02:19.740 --> 02:20.674
Me too.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.644
And anywhere I go, the
crowd naturally follows.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.179
Excelsior!

02:25.213 --> 02:26.079
(sighs)

02:26.113 --> 02:29.650
Is it weird that I
find Latin irresistible?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.185
Valerie still crushes
on you, right?

02:31.219 --> 02:31.885
Of course.

02:31.919 --> 02:32.986
She's only human.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.122
If you care about Corki, you'll
use your influence on

02:35.155 --> 02:37.725
Valerie to get her to
back out of the play.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.127
Then we'll step in with
our version of the show.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.129
Wait. We have a
version of the show?

02:42.162 --> 02:42.796
Sure.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.898
It's Version
One-Point-Oh-M-G

02:44.932 --> 02:47.100
Sun Hi is starring
in this play!

02:47.134 --> 02:49.002
The title needs work...

02:49.036 --> 02:50.738
Anything for Corki.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.873
We're rebuilding our trust.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.843
He's so charming,
it's almost unfair.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.545
Valerie: Oh, Jared...

02:57.578 --> 03:08.256
*

03:08.289 --> 03:09.056
Seriously.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.691
How do you people
walk like that?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.826
Jared, it's about my
version of the play,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.862
"Oz Cheers."

03:14.895 --> 03:16.897
I want you to star.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.832
STAR?? I'm in!

03:18.866 --> 03:19.600
*

03:19.633 --> 03:20.601
(noise of outrage)

03:20.634 --> 03:22.303
*

03:22.336 --> 03:23.170
(Jodi gasps)

03:23.203 --> 03:26.574
*

03:26.607 --> 03:27.140
(frustrated groan)

03:27.174 --> 03:28.342
* Make it pop,

03:28.376 --> 03:30.811
* Woo woo

03:30.844 --> 03:32.145
* Make it pop,

03:32.179 --> 03:34.748
* Woo woo,

03:34.782 --> 03:37.685
* I can't wait,
No I can't wait, *

03:37.718 --> 03:40.721
* No, I can't wait,
no, I can't wait. *

03:40.754 --> 03:42.189
* So make it pop,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.592
* We're bout to,
We're bout to blow, *

03:44.625 --> 03:45.993
* Wait till we drop,

03:46.026 --> 03:47.995
* Oh yeah, we're,
ready to go, *

03:48.028 --> 03:48.996
* Ain't gonna stop,

03:49.029 --> 03:51.632
* When is it time
for the show, *

03:51.665 --> 03:54.234
* We make it, you
make it, they make it, *

03:54.268 --> 03:57.805
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop! *

03:58.372 --> 03:59.640
*

03:59.673 --> 04:03.176
In what dimension are Jared and
Valerie controlling this play?

04:03.210 --> 04:05.979
Most likely the fifth dimension,
where reality can bend back

04:06.013 --> 04:09.216
on itself and you can change
time in the present.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.019
I think she was looking for
something more along the lines

04:12.052 --> 04:15.289
of "no dimension, Sun Hi,
because you're amazing."

04:15.323 --> 04:17.090
Thanks!

04:17.124 --> 04:19.660
Now back to you
and Jared...

04:19.693 --> 04:20.928
Jarki is done.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.795
Forever.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.900
Jared and Corki... Jarki?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.637
You know, like those
famous movie star couples.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.204
That makes us... Cadi?

04:31.238 --> 04:33.006
Please don't say that.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.377
Ummmm... Yuck?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.679
Come on, let's go
do what we do!

04:38.712 --> 04:41.315
*

04:41.349 --> 04:42.282
(cheering)

04:42.316 --> 04:45.118
Lets go!!

04:45.152 --> 04:49.222
* We're gonna take
down the whole system, *

04:49.256 --> 04:51.425
* Right now we're
on a mission, *

04:51.459 --> 04:54.227
* There's never a better
time to be doing it, *

04:54.261 --> 04:55.829
* Time for a change,

04:55.863 --> 04:59.400
* Let's make a change
here tonight, *

04:59.433 --> 05:01.335
* We're losing our minds,

05:01.369 --> 05:03.203
* We're losing our patience,

05:03.236 --> 05:06.874
* We're using up every
bit of passion we have, *

05:06.907 --> 05:08.776
* On everything else,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.210
* Oooh yeah,

05:10.243 --> 05:14.281
* Except for love,
Except for love, *

05:14.314 --> 05:16.149
* We're all out of time,

05:16.183 --> 05:18.085
* We're tired of chasing,

05:18.118 --> 05:21.755
* Chasing what they
want us to be, *

05:21.789 --> 05:29.196
* But we've had
enough, oh enough, *

05:29.229 --> 05:33.767
* We're gonna take down
the whole system, *

05:33.801 --> 05:35.803
* Right now we're
on a mission, *

05:35.836 --> 05:38.406
* There's never a better
time to be doing it. *

05:38.439 --> 05:40.007
* Time for a change,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.009
* Let's make a change
here tonight, *

05:42.042 --> 05:44.712
*

05:44.745 --> 05:52.119
* Na na na na na na na na
na na na hey hey hey hey, *

05:52.152 --> 05:58.792
* Na na na na na na na na
na na na hey hey hey, *

05:58.826 --> 06:02.763
* So get up and stand,
stand up for something, *

06:02.796 --> 06:05.298
* Something that
all can believe, *

06:05.332 --> 06:06.333
* Can believe,

06:06.366 --> 06:09.136
* But who can we trust,

06:09.169 --> 06:13.407
* Except for us oooh,

06:13.441 --> 06:17.945
* We're gonna take
down the whole system, *

06:17.978 --> 06:20.213
* Right now we're
on a mission, *

06:20.247 --> 06:22.816
* Never a better time
to be doing this, *

06:22.850 --> 06:24.418
* It's time for a change,

06:24.452 --> 06:28.121
* Let's make a change
here tonight, *

06:28.155 --> 06:35.162
* We're gonna raise our flag
so high can't take it down, *

06:35.195 --> 06:36.296
* Woah oh oh,

06:36.329 --> 06:40.768
* It's our time yeah, we're
gonna rule this town, *

06:40.801 --> 06:44.905
* Oh oha whoa,

06:44.938 --> 06:49.309
* We're gonna take down
the whole system, *

06:49.342 --> 06:51.311
* Right now we're
on a mission, *

06:51.344 --> 06:54.114
* There's never a better
time to be doing it. *

06:54.147 --> 06:55.516
* Time for a change,

06:55.549 --> 06:57.985
* Let's make a change
here tonight! *

06:58.018 --> 07:05.358
(cheering)

07:06.827 --> 07:09.129
We just killed it.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.965
We're too good to
not be in the play.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.266
(enthusiastic yell)

07:13.300 --> 07:15.402
Yes, but we rehearsed!

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
I like to be
prepared-- for everything.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.139
And my father is coming!

07:19.172 --> 07:20.541
He'll think I'm unfocused.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.375
I got it!

07:22.409 --> 07:23.877
I knew you'd understand.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.546
You, I'll never understand.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.347
I have an idea for the play.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.585
*

07:31.619 --> 07:32.219
Okay!

07:32.252 --> 07:34.187
The scarecrow is a cutie!

07:34.221 --> 07:35.923
For Dorothy that goes double!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.390
Everyone is jealous!

07:37.424 --> 07:39.192
'Cause they're
the perfect couple!

07:39.226 --> 07:40.060
(giggles)

07:40.093 --> 07:41.394
Hi.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.898
Oz Cheers!

07:46.333 --> 07:48.468
Uh... Closed
rehearsals, ladies.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.138
Only real actors allowed.

07:51.171 --> 07:55.042
And you can tell who the
real actors are because

07:55.075 --> 07:59.513
they're wearing pink, holding
pompoms and can do the splits.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.114
I know we've had
our problems,

08:01.148 --> 08:02.516
But we want to help you

08:02.550 --> 08:04.184
make this play a
success, Valerie.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.621
Okay. But only if you
triple-jump holla-holla-swear

08:07.655 --> 08:09.256
to do what I say.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.390
We do.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.260
Do what?

08:13.293 --> 08:16.229
Both: Triple-jump-holla-holla-
swear to do as you say.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.431
Great.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.167
Corki will be the toadstool.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.436
Jodi, you'll be third
tree from the left,

08:23.470 --> 08:25.005
and Sun Hi...

08:25.038 --> 08:26.039
Careful...

08:26.073 --> 08:27.040
The donkey.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.376
There's no donkey in The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz!

08:29.409 --> 08:30.377
There is now.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.179
Places, everyone!

08:32.212 --> 08:34.047
This is the scene
where Dorothy dances

08:34.081 --> 08:37.651
into the Scarecrow's,
strong, musculative arms.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.588
She couldn't find a real
word to describe these puppies.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.022
Who could?

08:42.055 --> 08:45.392
Whooo, ha,
ba-bang, mhmmm.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.564
Unfriended by one
thousand people?

08:50.598 --> 08:55.636
Internet... you
fickle goddess!

08:55.669 --> 08:59.106
"Oz Cheers," by
Valerie Graves.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.441
It'll be no Melwood
Stark oeuvre,

09:01.474 --> 09:03.343
but let's give it a read...

09:03.376 --> 09:05.679
How bad could it be?

09:05.713 --> 09:09.082
"An all-pink farm in Kansas..."

09:09.116 --> 09:13.386
*

09:13.420 --> 09:14.622
Corki!

09:14.655 --> 09:17.190
I'm sorry about earlier with
Valerie offering me the part.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.694
I was just drawn by the
magnetic pull of stardom.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.930
Talk to the hand.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.600
So how is your
plan working so far?

09:26.634 --> 09:29.002
We just need a moment
that we can shine

09:29.036 --> 09:31.438
and everybody will know we
should star in the play.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.272
Not Valerie.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.307
It'll be hard to
shine as a toadstool.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.109
Wanna trade?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.145
Nope, I'm good.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.351
The horror! The horror!

09:44.384 --> 09:47.320
*

09:47.354 --> 09:50.257
In this scene, Dorothy
and the Scarecrow kiss--

09:50.290 --> 09:51.524
What?!

09:51.558 --> 09:53.526
--The Good Witch of the North
sprinkles her with Yellow Brick

09:53.560 --> 09:56.596
dust, so she can whisk
her handsome Scarecrow,

09:56.630 --> 10:00.600
who is now a model, to
the Pink Castle of Oz.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.536
All hail Dorothy,
the new Queen of Oz.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.706
*

10:05.739 --> 10:07.107
Noooooooo!!!!

10:07.140 --> 10:08.308
Oof!

10:08.341 --> 10:09.677
Wheeeee!

10:12.579 --> 10:15.749
The confetti
comes after the kiss!

10:15.783 --> 10:17.985
And what's with the
flying toadstool?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.286
Sorry.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.620
It slipped.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.322
Now's our chance!

10:22.355 --> 10:24.624
Save Oz from the
evil Dorothy!

10:24.658 --> 10:26.326
Back to Kansas with you!

10:26.359 --> 10:27.594
Ah, 5-6-7-8.

10:27.627 --> 10:36.536
*

10:36.569 --> 10:38.271
Wow...

10:38.305 --> 10:38.839
That work?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.207
Is the play ours yet?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.142
Not exactly.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.643
The branches are
poking my kidney.

10:43.677 --> 10:50.283
*

10:50.317 --> 10:51.251
Stark?

10:51.284 --> 10:54.454
*

10:54.487 --> 10:55.288
STARK!!!

10:55.322 --> 11:00.327
(clattering)

11:01.528 --> 11:03.496
Maybe you should
see how the disaster,

11:03.530 --> 11:06.166
I mean "the
play," is progressing.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.600
Seeing as it is your last.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.337
*

11:10.370 --> 11:11.638
Valerie: Okay, from the top.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.472
*

11:12.505 --> 11:15.776
All hail Dorothy,
the new queen of Oz.

11:15.809 --> 11:22.215
*

11:22.249 --> 11:24.117
(screeches)

11:24.151 --> 11:26.653
Wait. That isn't confetti.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.055
Is it?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.056
I don't know.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
Let's see.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.424
*

11:31.458 --> 11:32.793
(screams)

11:32.826 --> 11:35.495
*

11:35.528 --> 11:41.101
Either this is paint, or I was
wrong about what confetti is.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.836
How could you
do this to me?!

11:42.870 --> 11:44.504
I am the head
cheerleader...

11:44.537 --> 11:45.338
(squeals)

11:45.372 --> 11:50.243
*

11:50.277 --> 11:51.411
What have you done?

11:51.444 --> 11:53.113
What? It wasn't me.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.748
I never repeat my
revenge pranks.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.150
It shows a total
lack of imagination.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.553
(choked sobbing)

12:00.587 --> 12:03.256
Mr. Stark, I didn't do it!

12:03.891 --> 12:06.559
*

12:06.593 --> 12:11.364
Mr. Stark, I said
I didn't do it!

12:11.398 --> 12:12.833
What are you
doing out here?

12:12.866 --> 12:13.666
Nothing.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.902
Certainly not crying.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.305
Because I'm a grown man, and
this is only a high school play.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.606
I know how you feel.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.274
I feel like a failure.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.509
I've never failed.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.410
Ever.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.678
How about all those
tests you failed?

12:25.712 --> 12:29.182
I meant I never failed
at anything important.

12:29.216 --> 12:33.486
My chances, on the other
hand, have come and gone.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.524
My one-man show, "I Can Dance,"

12:37.557 --> 12:41.561
my comedic interpretation
of "Les Mis"...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.463
Don't people die in Les Mis?

12:43.496 --> 12:46.466
Ha! That's how
everyone does it.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.369
In my version, they were
all invited to Versailles

12:49.402 --> 12:51.138
to share a light lunch.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.406
It was sublime.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.441
Sorry I missed it.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.279
Theater has been my life.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.915
I've failed it.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.216
I've failed you.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.053
Me?

13:06.086 --> 13:10.390
The theater lets young people
imagine worlds they didn't know

13:10.423 --> 13:14.828
they'd see and have feelings
they never knew they had.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.300
I thought we were
just doing a musical.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.603
The real tragedy is that
MacKendrick students

13:23.636 --> 13:27.707
will never feel the
power of theater again.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.410
What do we need to
pull this together?

13:30.443 --> 13:32.312
A more manageable script.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.848
Remember mine was over
two-hundred pages,

13:34.882 --> 13:38.919
double-sided,
eight point font.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.622
*

13:42.655 --> 13:43.556
I got this!

13:43.590 --> 13:46.726
*

13:46.759 --> 13:49.462
Why does this keep
happening to me?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.932
Is it because I've been
a little less than kind

13:51.965 --> 13:54.201
to a student or two
at MacKendrick Prep?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.536
Valerie, don't
sell yourself short.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.407
You've been less than
kind to so, so many

14:00.440 --> 14:02.442
students at MacKendrick.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.712
*

14:05.745 --> 14:07.881
Stark: There is
no musical.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.282
It's cancelled.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.483
Cancelled?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.851
You mean like
cancelled cancelled?

14:11.885 --> 14:13.653
Or still on cancelled?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.822
If you need me,
I'll be practicing

14:15.855 --> 14:18.691
my slow mo lifeguard
run in my office.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.661
Warning. I'll probably
be shirtless.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.495
Wait!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.497
I have a story.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.902
"In Julius Caesar, a guy named
Julius eats a garlic-y salad..."

14:28.936 --> 14:31.004
Wait, this is a failed
English assignment.

14:31.038 --> 14:31.871
Other side.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.540
Right.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.542
"Hunting Dorothy?"

14:35.575 --> 14:37.244
It's good, right?

14:37.277 --> 14:40.747
Come on we've come
too far to quit now.

14:40.780 --> 14:41.949
She's right.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.717
There's no way of knowing
what'll happen unless we try.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.320
Okay. Let's do it.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.022
Valerie: I'll do it, too.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.723
You look all clean and tidy.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.559
The last time this happened--

14:52.592 --> 14:54.427
--I ordered special
soap online.

14:54.461 --> 14:58.598
It worked for me, but
poor Heather's all blotchy.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.466
Ah yes.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.534
There's still the issue
of this prank.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.570
I didn't do it.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.040
She's right... I changed
the confetti to paint.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.376
(everyone gasps)

15:09.409 --> 15:11.311
The only way I could fix this

15:11.344 --> 15:12.912
was to try and make
Valerie quit.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.781
I just couldn't think
of anything original,

15:14.814 --> 15:17.884
so I copied Sun Hi's
last prank.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
I'm sorry, Valerie.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.722
The chin let you down.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.024
I forgive you.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.158
All: You do?

15:25.192 --> 15:29.629
I'm an overachieving,
beautiful, taker of high roads.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.863
I forgive Jared.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.500
And this way, we get
to kiss and make up.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.134
(outraged gasp)

15:34.167 --> 15:36.369
Well, let the show go on!

15:36.403 --> 15:37.170
Yes!

15:37.204 --> 15:38.871
Mr. Stark, help
make this a splash!

15:38.905 --> 15:41.374
And not the swimming
pool kind, of course,

15:41.408 --> 15:43.076
we can't waste
another minute.

15:43.110 --> 15:47.347
Jodi, you be Scarecrow,
Corki, you be the Cowardly lion,

15:47.380 --> 15:49.549
Let me guess,
you'll be Dorothy?

15:49.582 --> 15:50.383
No.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.485
That role has been
tainted by Valerie.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.487
I'll be the Tin Woodman.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.490
As long as there's
shine, I'm good.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.658
This is crazy.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.327
No sleep tonight!

16:00.360 --> 16:05.432
*

16:05.465 --> 16:07.367
* Where are my girls at,

16:07.400 --> 16:08.835
* Where are my boys,

16:08.868 --> 16:11.438
* Cause we wanna make
some, make some noise *

16:11.471 --> 16:13.840
* We don't even care what
the neighbours say *

16:13.873 --> 16:16.843
* We're turning up loud
so come out and play, *

16:16.876 --> 16:20.447
* Imma, do it, do it, do
it, do it, do it, alright! *

16:20.480 --> 16:23.450
* Imma, do it, do it,
do it, how we want, *

16:23.483 --> 16:26.019
* Everybody knows that
it could get crazy, *

16:26.053 --> 16:28.855
* What, you know we
shake it up, real good, *

16:28.888 --> 16:30.490
* We'll move it like,

16:30.523 --> 16:31.124
* Oh!

16:31.158 --> 16:32.692
* We'll move it right

16:32.725 --> 16:33.726
* Oh!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.695
* We'll move like you've
never seen before, *

16:35.728 --> 16:39.532
* Believe, we leave,
you searching our name, *

16:39.566 --> 16:41.934
* Don't you know,

16:41.968 --> 16:44.837
* We're with you
til' the end, *

16:44.871 --> 16:47.740
* So don't even pretend,

16:47.774 --> 16:50.810
* That you don't wanna ride,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.112
* Altogether, altogether,

16:52.145 --> 16:53.513
* We're making moves,

16:53.546 --> 16:54.914
* So baby come follow,

16:54.947 --> 16:56.116
* Where we go,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.017
* There's never tomorrow,

16:58.051 --> 16:59.486
* Oh oh oh,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.088
* We're gonna do it like,

17:01.121 --> 17:02.489
* Oh oh oh,

17:02.522 --> 17:03.956
* Ohhhhhh, hey,

17:03.990 --> 17:08.861
*

17:08.895 --> 17:11.398
* You know our name,
Seen our game, *

17:11.431 --> 17:13.500
* Be cautious,
Gotta style so sick, *

17:13.533 --> 17:14.701
* Make you nauseous,

17:14.734 --> 17:17.904
* We always come when the
crowd wants us to be there, *

17:17.937 --> 17:21.108
* We make it happen when we
want, yeah we all care, *

17:21.141 --> 17:24.511
* Imma, do it, do it, do it,
do it, do it, alright,

17:24.544 --> 17:27.514
* Imma, do it, do it,
do it, how we want, *

17:27.547 --> 17:29.716
* Everybody knows that
It could get crazy, *

* What, you know we
shake it up, real good, *

17:32.552 --> 17:33.920
* We'll move it like,

17:33.953 --> 17:34.821
* Oh,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.423

never seen before, *

17:39.459 --> 17:43.663
* Believe, we leave,
you shouting our name, *

17:43.696 --> 17:45.532
* Don't you know,

* We're with you
til' the end, *

17:48.468 --> 17:51.171
* So don't even pretend,

17:51.204 --> 17:54.141
* That you don't wanna ride,

17:54.174 --> 17:55.642
* Altogether, altogether,

17:55.675 --> 17:58.578
* We're making moves,
so baby come follow, *

17:58.611 --> 18:01.214
* Where we go, there's
never tomorrow, *

18:01.248 --> 18:02.649
* Oh oh oh,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.517
* We're gonna do it like,

18:04.551 --> 18:05.952
* Oh oh oh,

18:05.985 --> 18:07.987
* Ohhhhhh hey!

18:09.922 --> 18:11.224
That's it.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.227
Now let's get some sleep.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.062
And hope it works.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.531
I still have a few
things to finish.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.066
Same here/ Me too.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.068
And I'll get to
work on the lighting!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.936
All: No!!!

18:23.970 --> 18:26.706
Do you think we'll
be ready, Mr. Stark?

18:26.739 --> 18:29.909
We don't go on
because we're ready...

18:29.942 --> 18:33.846
We go on because
it's show time.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.750
And quite possibly
our final curtain...

18:37.784 --> 18:39.686
*

18:40.220 --> 18:46.559
*

18:46.593 --> 18:49.896
Ugh, I'm so tired, I
won't be prepared.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.233
*

18:53.266 --> 18:55.101
I am the Lowardly Cion!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.636
(boos)

18:56.669 --> 19:00.273
I mean, the Cionly Loward!

19:00.307 --> 19:03.976
I mean um...

19:04.010 --> 19:05.978
Line?

19:06.012 --> 19:08.047
(sobs)

19:08.080 --> 19:08.815
*

19:08.848 --> 19:10.183
What if they don't like me.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.051
*

19:12.084 --> 19:14.787
Hey! You probably
want me to sign...

19:14.821 --> 19:16.155
Suit yourself.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.558
Want me to sign this?

19:18.591 --> 19:19.559
Selfie?

19:19.592 --> 19:20.560
*

19:20.593 --> 19:21.628
(crowd murmuring)

19:21.661 --> 19:22.195
Hey!

19:22.229 --> 19:25.198
(crowd murmuring)

19:25.232 --> 19:26.699
(sobs)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.100
(sighs)

19:28.134 --> 19:29.736
I hope they
like my costumes.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.103
*

19:31.137 --> 19:33.673
These are so stupid.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.242
Who would wear them?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.043
And who designed
them? Ugh.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.812
*

19:39.846 --> 19:40.847
I did.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.648
(laughter)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.182
*

19:43.216 --> 19:44.183
(bell ringing)

19:44.217 --> 19:45.752
(all yelling)

19:47.119 --> 19:53.293
*

19:54.694 --> 19:56.663
Will you move the
rock to the left...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.298
Stage left!

19:58.331 --> 19:59.832
Well Mr. Stark.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.203
I sure hope your talent
pool doesn't take a dive.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.939
If you know what
I chlor-mean.

20:06.973 --> 20:07.840
Oh yeah well.

20:07.874 --> 20:12.679
Your... You... urgh!

20:12.712 --> 20:15.915
You took all the
good pool puns.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.651
Why do you hate
this play so much?

20:18.685 --> 20:23.189
Because the arts create
false hope, Mr. Stark.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.027
Well I think it's
gonna go swimmingly.

20:28.060 --> 20:28.928
Ah-ha!

20:28.961 --> 20:30.830
Too late.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.834
Listen up, everyone!

20:34.867 --> 20:37.704
I understand we're all feeling
pretty worried right now.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.939
So it's time to
get inspirational.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.008
Let's talk about
our hopes and dreams.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.276
I just had a dream.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.811
I was saying my lines.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.213
The audience booed and
heckled me off the stage.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.048
It was horrible.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.718
We are not ready for this.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.720
Maybe not that dream.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.957
I just dreamt people saw my
costumes and called them stupid.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.192
Someone give me a
happy dream, hmm.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.828
I have a recurring
one that

21:01.861 --> 21:03.930
when I talk to people
they understand me.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.165
But then when I wake
up they don't.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.369
Alright, so my dream
speech has backfired.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.303
(sighs)

21:10.337 --> 21:16.275
*

21:16.309 --> 21:19.111
Good evening,
ladies and gentleman.

21:19.145 --> 21:22.782
Welcome to
MacKendrick Prep High School.

21:22.815 --> 21:29.255
(applause)

21:29.288 --> 21:30.657
It's on...

21:30.690 --> 21:34.060
*
