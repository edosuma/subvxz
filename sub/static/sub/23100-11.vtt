01:22.833 --> 01:24.541
In the way?

01:24.625 --> 01:27.541
The squish is the highest form
of bug evolution.

01:28.291 --> 01:29.500
It has so many uses.

01:29.583 --> 01:30.416
Such as?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.375
Well, yeah, such as, uh...

01:32.458 --> 01:33.750
Well, uh, the, uh-- This--

01:43.958 --> 01:45.791
-Uh-oh.
-Whoa!

01:47.625 --> 01:50.125
Help! I'm squashed.

01:50.208 --> 01:51.958
Oh, sorry, Buzz.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.833
Whoa. Where did you get that?

02:00.333 --> 02:03.833
Cool, huh? We found it
in the Mountain of Amazing Marvels.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.625
Wow. What's it called?

02:08.708 --> 02:12.625
-Uh, we don't have a name yet.
-How about the motor mobile?

02:12.708 --> 02:15.208
-Or autowagon.
-Or the engine cart.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.375
Or-- Or Blungle Schnot.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.583
Uh, blong-- Blongle-- Blong-- Blongsen...

02:20.666 --> 02:22.000
Blongle Schnot!

02:22.708 --> 02:24.916
Blongle Schnot. I like it.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.666
So, is our Blongle Schnot
ready for blast-off, Crick?

02:30.375 --> 02:31.250
Yeah, almost.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.375
Come on.

02:33.458 --> 02:36.333
Three, two, one, zero.

02:37.916 --> 02:40.541
Wow. It can go that far, huh?

02:40.625 --> 02:44.291
We, uh... We just need somewhere... flat.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.208
Yeah, with nothing in the way.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.041
The road?

02:48.125 --> 02:52.125
But we can't play on the road.
You've all heard the stories.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.958
I've seen them go out there.
Bunch of bees playing tag on the road.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.750
Next day, nothing left.

02:59.833 --> 03:03.000
Nothing, but a puddle of honey.

03:03.625 --> 03:08.333
So? They're just stories. And we need
somewhere to drive our Blongle Schnot.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.333
By my calculations, the road is, uh...

03:11.958 --> 03:15.375
-Crickto-matically perfect.
-But isn't playing on the road--

03:15.458 --> 03:17.500
Crazy? Reckless? Totally insane?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.875
Bugs, it'll be fine.

03:20.416 --> 03:23.791

Oh.

05:04.250 --> 05:09.833
Um, Walter, maybe your squish
doesn't really... fit.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.833
Not fit?

05:11.375 --> 05:12.333
Not fit?

Surely you're not dissing the squish, Jay.
I am the squish.

Oh, yeah, I didn't mean--

05:23.416 --> 05:24.750
Don't worry about me.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.291
I have plenty of other things to do.

05:28.458 --> 05:32.041

-Our Blongle Schnot.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.416

then hit the road.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.291
A sud flood!

We'll have to swim for it.

08:24.916 --> 08:27.291

08:27.833 --> 08:29.166
We'll be fine, Buzz.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.375

- Wait, Dad, I forgot my book.
- Oh, Julia.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.125

-What are you doing up there?
-Oh, just enjoying the view.

09:11.541 --> 09:13.625
Well, there's no time for that.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.750

No, no. Don't freak out, Walter.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000

10:41.333 --> 10:44.041

10:44.125 --> 10:45.291
Yeah, I'm the slug.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.791

and point at me and-- What?

10:49.875 --> 10:50.958
Now what do I do?

10:53.375 --> 10:57.166

That it's going to, uh, rain?

12:51.291 --> 12:55.291
I know, it means you're hungry.
I'm sort of a bit peckish myself.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.833
No. Would you--?
It means we're being watched.

13:00.208 --> 13:03.083

13:15.750 --> 13:18.958
Oh, my, it's a mystical symbol.

13:19.041 --> 13:24.583
Ah. By my, uh, crickta-calculations,
it's made of... wood.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.291
But what's it for?

13:26.375 --> 13:29.833
Uh, isn't it just an arrow
telling us to go straight?

13:34.875 --> 13:35.708
Bugs!

13:36.458 --> 13:37.750
In case you forgot...

13:37.833 --> 13:40.791
there's still a mystery happening
on my head.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.416
Hey, look, a leaf.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.583
And something's drawn on it.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.916
Monster!

13:59.791 --> 14:02.666
Monster!

14:03.833 --> 14:06.666
I'm not a monster.
I'm a stalk-eyed fly, okay?

14:07.041 --> 14:09.000
That means I'm a bug, like you.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.791
Oh, yeah, sorry.

14:13.875 --> 14:14.708
We-- We totally--

14:14.791 --> 14:17.208
We totally knew that.

14:20.333 --> 14:23.291
My name's Melvin.
I was watching you guys play...

14:23.875 --> 14:26.083
so I made a treasure hunt for you.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.500
So, you were watching us.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.250
Your eye sticks set off my head sticks.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.500
Sorry about that.
Anyway, I'm kind of a game master.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.416
I created this new game
called Dandelions and Wagons.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.625
-Wanna play?
-Definitely.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.583
I love dandelions and wagons.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.416
Great. I'll just get out
my pocket rulebook.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.666
Here's the list of rules
for reading the rulebook.

14:53.416 --> 14:55.583
Kumi rolled three consecutive twos,

14:55.666 --> 14:58.833
so she takes three steps sideways
and two jumps back.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.958
But that's where I am.

15:02.041 --> 15:05.416
Oh, yes,
so you get sent to the dark cavern.

15:05.791 --> 15:06.625
Over there.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.166
Uh, can both of us be in the, uh,
dark cavern?

15:12.250 --> 15:16.333
No. You have to go to the Enchanted Garden
and miss five turns.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.375
Or is it six? I'll check the rules again.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.750
This game is so compli-micated!

15:23.833 --> 15:26.125
Come on. Let's play something else.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.583
Shh.

15:33.375 --> 15:36.083
That means you finally scored
the Dandelion.

15:36.875 --> 15:40.375
Go around the board six more times
to put it in the wagon.

15:42.375 --> 15:47.458
Uh, so, that's the only point of the game?
To put this in a wagon?

15:48.041 --> 15:51.958
Well, I mean, yes, but there's
much, much more to it than that.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.625
Actually, yeah, that is the whole game.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.250
-Ow!
-Hey, bugs.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.166
We're playing a game I invented.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.583
-I call it Throwing a Stick.
-I'd love to hear about it.

16:04.666 --> 16:08.791
-Tell me every single rule.
-Okay, okay. Listen carefully.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.208
Someone throws a stick,

16:11.291 --> 16:14.333
and then... we run after it.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.083
- I got it! I got it! I got-- Okay.
- That's it?

16:19.166 --> 16:22.083
Uh, yeah. Come on, bugs. Let's play.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.500
Wanna play my game again?

16:31.916 --> 16:34.833
You'll love it once you get more into it.

16:34.916 --> 16:37.083
- Really, you will.
- I got it! Okay.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.750
Think I'll just go.
Do something fun like...

16:41.708 --> 16:45.375
Oh, I don't know,
maybe... go to the Big House.

16:47.541 --> 16:50.541
Did he just say
he's going to the Big House?

16:51.375 --> 16:53.083
- What?
- The Big House?

16:53.333 --> 16:56.416
Yep, the Big House.
Hang out there all the time.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.666
Kind of, you know, totally amazing.

16:58.750 --> 17:02.541
Whoa. That is amazing.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.290
I know a shortcut
if anyone wants to join me.

17:05.415 --> 17:06.583
Do we ever!

17:14.458 --> 17:16.708
Hey, Jay, you have to look at this.

17:16.790 --> 17:20.625
The... crickta-wayfinder says
the Big House is in the...

17:22.000 --> 17:23.375
The opposite direction.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.708
Then it must be wrong.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.290
It doesn't matter. Melvin knows the way.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.083
That doesn't look like the Big House.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.000
No.

17:39.166 --> 17:43.166
But if you climb up to the top,
you'll see how close we are to it.

17:43.333 --> 17:47.458
Um, and how exactly can we get to the top?

17:47.541 --> 17:49.791
You can use, eh, that.

17:56.166 --> 17:59.583
I don't see the Big House. Whoa!

17:59.666 --> 18:01.458
This is as slippery as ice.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.000
Whoa. Whoa!

18:09.083 --> 18:11.458
You need balance and poise like me.

18:11.541 --> 18:12.791
Whoa.

18:25.875 --> 18:29.708
Well, it's not the Big House,
but it's kind of fun.

18:29.791 --> 18:32.125
Sticky. I wanna get out.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.291
Welcome. Make yourself comfy.

18:36.375 --> 18:37.375
This is my home.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.125
You mean... you tricked us?

18:41.875 --> 18:45.250
I'm sorry. I--
I just wanted you to come here.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.791
I don't mind. I like this.

18:47.875 --> 18:51.500
Maybe now we can play another game
of Dandelions and Wagons.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.791
But it's kind of slimy in here.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.541
Yeah, and sticky.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.291
Hey, Bugs, this is my home, you know.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.458
Okay. Let's play a different game.

19:04.916 --> 19:10.583
Is it called, uh,
How to Get Out of The, um... Slime?

19:10.666 --> 19:11.625
Whoa!

19:11.708 --> 19:16.041
Kind of. I'll help you get out.
First, you have to guess the password.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.375
Uh, what do we have to do?

19:18.458 --> 19:21.166
We have to guess a word?

19:21.750 --> 19:24.833

19:25.791 --> 19:29.000

19:38.875 --> 19:41.041

19:43.291 --> 19:45.125
How are we gonna guess a word?

19:45.458 --> 19:46.750
It could be any word.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.958
So... any guesses for the password?

20:01.041 --> 20:02.958
-Uh, sticky?
-Slimy?

20:03.041 --> 20:04.041

How do we get out of here?

20:55.666 --> 20:57.958
So, any more guesses?

20:58.041 --> 21:00.625
We want out of here, Melvin, now!

21:01.416 --> 21:03.500
But aren't you guys having fun?

21:03.583 --> 21:07.333
Melvin, we're not having fun.
This isn't how you treat your friends.

21:07.416 --> 21:11.250
Oh. Wow. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.500
I'll-- I'll just get my rope
and pull you out.

21:15.000 --> 21:15.833
Sorry.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.791
I think Melvin is sad.

21:19.875 --> 21:23.000
I feel bad,
but this isn't the way to treat friends.

21:23.666 --> 21:24.875
Hmm.

21:24.958 --> 21:29.875
Do you think... maybe being friends
is a clue to the password?

21:29.958 --> 21:32.000
Ah. Perhaps.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.916
So, uh... what do friends need?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.750
Uh, to be nice, kind, friendly!

21:38.833 --> 21:41.583
Yeah, I guess... all you need is love.

you wanted to be our friend?

22:10.083 --> 22:11.208
Mm-hm.

22:11.291 --> 22:14.791
You should've just said so.
We'd love to be your friends.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.625
