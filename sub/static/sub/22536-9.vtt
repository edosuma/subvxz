WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.795
Previously on
crisis...
Those feds, finley and dunn,

00:03.800 --> 00:05.097
Have clarenbach.
I still need him.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.795
How do you know it's gibson?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.859
The program we ran--
there was a massacre.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.168
Widener put gibson's name on it,
and he put a laser dot

00:11.170 --> 00:13.001
On his daughter's heart
to keep him quiet.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.877
Widener threatened to
kill gibson's daughter?
Yeah.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.201
So it's personal.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.701
I want to see my kid.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.449
Think it's time for you,
agent hurst,

00:22.450 --> 00:24.179
To go into the hole.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.978
You said I
could see my kid.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.685
Hurst?

00:33.660 --> 00:36.197
You_know where
this place is?

00:36.200 --> 00:40.625
Yes, agent finley...
And I can take you there.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.369
Clarenbach is crucial
to the pharmaceutical

00:42.370 --> 00:44.235
Side of th/Ls‘.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.559
You cannot let g/bson get him.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.037
I need clarenbach.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.473
Woman (on tv):
Another ba/laro’ student

00:48.480 --> 00:49.879
Emma vr/es, has been released.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.472
Dunn:
If it [3‘ g/bson,

00:51.480 --> 00:53.641
He took his own daughter.
He had his finger cut off,

00:53.650 --> 00:54.571
And he made her watch.

00:54.580 --> 00:55.649
Francis.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.538
Jonas.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.040
I've been here before.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.756
Yes, we both have.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.881
Are you ready to get to work?

01:06.590 --> 01:08.922
As the ballard school kidnapping
marks its seventh day,

01:08.930 --> 01:10.989
There may at last
have been a breakthrough.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.696
Sources tell us that the fbi
has received new information

01:13.700 --> 01:15.759
Regarding the location
of the hostages.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.830
A massive ground operation
is currently underway as

01:18.840 --> 01:22.401
Search teams focus their efforts
on an area of southern maryland.

01:22.410 --> 01:25.072
Sir, the last house
on foxtrot number 78 is cleared.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.877
It is negative
as the kidnapper's location.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.518
How many grids left?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.943
23 square-mile grids
are contained within the area

01:30.950 --> 01:33.009
Designated by agent finley
as a possible location.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.112
We've eliminated nine of them.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.553
What's the time frame

01:35.560 --> 01:37.050
On the remaining 14 grids?

01:37.060 --> 01:39.551
16 hours.
We need to go faster.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.959
Every boot we have is already
on the ground, sir.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.552
We need more boots.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.765
Emma:
When can I see

01:44.770 --> 01:46.761
My father again?
Dunn:
Soon, emma,

01:46.770 --> 01:48.294
But, uh, we need to
talk to you ﬁrst.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.733
But he's going to jail

01:49.740 --> 01:51.401
Because of what he did for me.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.867
None of this is your fault.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.609
Dunn:
Emma, you can help us.

01:55.610 --> 01:58.408
We need to know...

01:58.410 --> 02:00.878
Everything that's going
on inside the mansion.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.140
Are your classmates okay?

02:04.150 --> 02:05.981
I don't think
any of them got shot.

02:05.990 --> 02:07.981
But somebody did get shot?

02:07.990 --> 02:09.309
During the attack.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.217
What attack, emma?

02:10.230 --> 02:11.754
Did someone

02:11.760 --> 02:13.978
Attack the place
you were being held?
Right.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.321
You don't know. There was
a sustained firefight

02:16.330 --> 02:17.820
For at least 20 minutes.

02:17.830 --> 02:21.630
Very controlled,
lots of three-round bursts.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.130
I only heard mp-55,

02:23.140 --> 02:24.630
You know,
like the guards carry.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.665
You sound like you know a lot
about weapons.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.308
My father's idea of bonding
usually involves a firing range.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.346
The place got
shot up pretty good.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.648
Some of the guards died.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.312
How many?
I don't know.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.673
Three or four.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.942
How many attackers?
Do you know?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.154
Just one.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.616
I think just one.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.848
But it was kyle
who killed the guy in charge.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.923
Who did kyle kill?

02:50.930 --> 02:52.295
Agent hurst.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.495
He was about
to shoot mr. Gibson.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.300
Kyle had to do it.

02:58.310 --> 03:01.768
We're going
to show you some photos.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.409
Maybe you can help identify
the attacker for us.

03:12.050 --> 03:14.553
(door creaks)

03:52.990 --> 03:54.719
(knocking)

03:54.730 --> 03:55.856
Man:
Let's go.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.021
(knocking)

03:58.030 --> 04:00.498
Yeah, just a sec!

04:04.740 --> 04:07.163
It's all yours.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.206
Comm: _
Secure radio
chatter indicates

04:13.220 --> 04:14.949
They've eliminated
a target close by.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.542
How far from here?

04:16.550 --> 04:19.587
Nine and a half miles.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.086
National guard is mobilized.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.081
Clarenbach helped
get them close.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.921
With the geometric
search pattern they're using,

04:28.930 --> 04:30.625
They'll be here
in less than six hours.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.189
I need 12.
Open a line out.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.134
(beeping)

04:39.070 --> 04:40.469
Emma vries identified
the attacker.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.277
It was thayer, sir,
one of the soldiers

04:42.280 --> 04:43.907
We pulled out
of the pakistani embassy.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.571
Widener got him
into the mansion somehow.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.468
The cia got
a man inside?
But just one.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.778
I don't think they know
the location of the kidnappers,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.439
Or they would have
taken gibson out.

04:51.450 --> 04:52.883
You need to be prepared

04:52.890 --> 04:54.949
To explain this
to the president.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.916
We're going to the white house?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.490
No. He's on his way here.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.790
(woman speaking chinese on tv)

05:10.610 --> 05:13.033
(phone ringing)

05:34.930 --> 05:37.694
Hello.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.521
Distorted male voice:
I know who you are.
I know what you do.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.292
I-I work for the consul.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.029
I am just an attach.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.861
That is why I need your wife.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.836
My wife?

05:48.840 --> 05:51.946
She's a colonel in your
foreign intelligence service.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.714
I need a spy.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.114
(beep)

05:58.120 --> 06:00.918
What do you want?

06:02.690 --> 06:07.184
If I do that, it
will start a war.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.397
(distant chatter)

06:20.410 --> 06:22.401
Agent hurst is dead.
How are you doing with that?

06:24.250 --> 06:26.844
I want to know
how kyle is doing.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.715
How are you doing,
for that matter?

06:28.720 --> 06:30.142
I'm fine.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.515
Widener's guys went after you

06:31.520 --> 06:33.249
And your sister
pretty hard last night.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.889
Hard? They killed wilson
and dropped keegan off a bridge

06:36.890 --> 06:39.154
At the end of a rope.
I'm fine.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.799
Please, sit.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.864
I'm told my son killed a man.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.337
Is that true?

06:51.910 --> 06:53.332
Yes, sir.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.830
(sighs)

06:57.280 --> 07:01.171
No disrespect, bill...

07:01.180 --> 07:04.570
But I don't want any
filters, not today.

07:06.590 --> 07:09.411
You two have been the tip
of the spear on the this case.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.523
I want you to tell me
what's really going on.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.885
I don't _care what
you think is safe

07:13.900 --> 07:16.460
To tell me, I don't care
what you can prove.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.426
I want to hear what you believe.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.395
We believe

07:23.410 --> 07:25.628
The kidnapper is a man
named francis gibson, sir.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.961
Gibson. But he's one
of the hostages.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.369
They hung his finger
from the white house fence.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.075
We can't prove it, but

07:32.080 --> 07:33.945
We believe he_orchestrated
a dlsmformatlon strategy

07:33.950 --> 07:35.713
To deflect his responsibility.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.870
Let's say that's true.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.448
What does he want?

07:39.460 --> 07:40.984
Gibson was a
Cla analyst.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.311
They dismissed him
18 months ago.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.582
As far as we can tell,
this is about payback.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.581
Why was he fired?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.897
We're not sure, sir.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.595
We believe gibson was involved

07:50.600 --> 07:52.921
In the creation
of a secret cia death squad.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.328
And because
you're taking this to me

07:54.340 --> 07:55.989
Instead of the attorney general,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.558
I'm assuming you have no
evidence for this, either.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.969
Finley:
Gibson sent congressman wirth

07:58.970 --> 08:00.403
Inside the cia to steal a video.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.002
I saw a piece of it.

08:02.010 --> 08:04.729
You did?
What was on it?

08:04.750 --> 08:07.674
American soldiers intentionally
massacring civilians.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.944
Evidence.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.180
What did director widener say
about this?

08:12.190 --> 08:14.681
He's stonewalling me, sir.

08:14.690 --> 08:19.081
Or he's being careful,
which is his job, bill.

08:19.090 --> 08:22.321
Still, I want to hear his
response to this myself.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.167
Tell gabe widener I'd like him
to join us here. Now.

08:33.010 --> 08:35.376
Sya, I do not understand.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.268
You are my wife.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.202
(beeping and trilling)

08:39.210 --> 08:40.541
How long has that been there?

08:41.680 --> 08:43.671
You are not the only one

08:43.690 --> 08:45.317
Who works
for our government, meng.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.878
(beeping)

08:55.700 --> 08:57.520
Stay here,

08:57.530 --> 08:59.725
And I will save our son.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.665
They've cleared another house.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.206
Three miles away.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.702
That's the closest
they'll get for a while.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.076
Jonas.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.502
I'm glad you're here.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.569
You're glad?

09:18.050 --> 09:19.847
It's been such a long time.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.816
(exhales)

09:21.820 --> 09:24.050
Yeah, I suppose it has been.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.558
What do you want from me?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.949
I'm gonna save your life.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.525
I don't want to
kill you, jonas.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.735
Widener does.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.368
And he will, eventually.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.770
Unless...

09:41.780 --> 09:44.305
Help me get widener.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.338
(sighs)

09:47.350 --> 09:49.511
Widener? If you wanted

09:49.520 --> 09:50.942
To kill him,
there are easier ways

09:50.950 --> 09:52.542
Than kidnapping dozens of kids,

09:52.550 --> 09:55.110
And you certainly
don't need me.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.008
I'm not gonna kill him.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.453
I'm gonna destroy him,
and I need you for that.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.792
Help me, and I can solve

10:01.800 --> 10:04.428
Both our problems.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.692
Make your choice fast.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.168
It's happening now.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.029
(phone ringing)

10:29.760 --> 10:31.955
Dad, what's going on?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.951
They had me in the back again
for questioning.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.825
I think they're afraid
they're about to be found.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.991
They've been weakened,
and they're nervous.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.491
If we can exploit that,
it's our chance to escape.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.161
I'm gonna need your help,
though, both of you.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.159
You think you can do that?

10:43.170 --> 10:44.694
Anything.

10:45.610 --> 10:46.838
Yeah.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.501
Okay, first we need to quickly

10:48.510 --> 10:50.398
Spread the word to the
other kids; we need their eyes.

10:50.410 --> 10:51.900
Guards were killed
in that assault.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.343
They've changed
their patrol pattern.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.341
If we're gonna move on them,
I need to know

10:55.350 --> 10:57.511
How many there are.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.646
Understood?

10:58.650 --> 11:00.117
Yes.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.588
But, dad, I-if the cops
are getting close,

11:02.590 --> 11:05.582
Wouldn't it be smarter
just to wait to be rescued?

11:05.590 --> 11:06.989
The kidnappers' plan's
falling apart.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.094
Dangerous people
are desperate, beth ann.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.160
If we're gonna escape,
we need to move fast.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.939
(computer trilling)

11:31.620 --> 11:33.679
(trilling)

11:45.500 --> 11:47.263
(trilling)

11:49.340 --> 11:51.808
Widener:
Mr. President.

11:51.810 --> 11:54.506
You wanted to see me.
Congressman Wirth
took a video

11:54.510 --> 11:57.502
From the cia, uploaded it from
his phone just before he died.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.842
What was on it?

11:59.850 --> 12:02.341
I can't speak
to that, sir.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.079
When the congressman's phone
was examined,

12:04.090 --> 12:06.240
It had been erased.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.482
Devore:
So maybe there's proof

12:09.490 --> 12:11.355
Of a cia death squad
and maybe there isn't.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.385
That's gonna be
a senate hearing.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.549
Yes, sir.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.221
Yes, sir.
But me?

12:16.230 --> 12:18.596
What I want to know right now

12:18.600 --> 12:20.488
Is what does francis gibson
have to do

12:20.500 --> 12:22.058
With the kidnapping of my son?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.698
From what we can tell, nothing.
Mr. President, please.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.337
Agent dunn.
We've looked into
It, of course,

12:26.340 --> 12:28.001
But there's no evidence
to suggest

12:28.010 --> 12:29.602
He's anything other
than a hostage.

12:29.610 --> 12:32.408
Your men kidnapped me
and my sister yesterday.

12:32.410 --> 12:33.741
Olsen:
Agent dunn.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.214
You need to step out.

12:38.220 --> 12:42.554
Widener:
I heard about what
happened to you.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.380
It must have been horrific.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.654
You should be commended
for even coming to work today.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.626
(horns blaring)

12:54.640 --> 12:56.130
(tires squealing)

12:56.140 --> 12:58.506
(brakes screeching)

13:02.540 --> 13:04.872
We've lost the network, sir.
All the computers are out.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.700
Status. What the hell
was that?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.301
Mr. President,
it appears to be

13:08.320 --> 13:10.777
A massive cyber attack--
all our systems are down.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.280
This building or the entire fbi?

13:12.290 --> 13:13.917
Not just the fbi, sir--
anything connected

13:13.920 --> 13:15.649
To the internet.
Banking systems,

13:15.660 --> 13:17.252
Power grid, air traffic control,

13:17.260 --> 13:20.923
Emergency services. The virus
will spread into them all.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.750
Cyber attack? Are you sure?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.591
Yes, sir. On a massive scale.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.227
Gabe.

13:26.230 --> 13:27.891
We should go to
infocon 2, sir.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.788
Bill?
Something

13:29.810 --> 13:32.005
This aggressive, this fast,
I agree.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.002
Take us to infocon 2.

13:35.010 --> 13:35.908
Sir.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.941
What is infocon 2?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.770
That means
we're under attack

13:42.780 --> 13:45.419
And we're gonna shut the country
down before someone else does.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.124
Olsen:
Infocon 2 Is estah/Ilsheo;
mr. Pres/dent.

13:52.130 --> 13:54.086
Critical computer networks
are cutting outside links.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.421
Conventional communications
are out.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.762
We're establishing
a point-to-point laser comm link

13:58.770 --> 14:01.728
To the white house and pentagon,
sir. Up in two minutes.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.328
Shouldn't they get potus
to the white house?

14:05.340 --> 14:07.103
The fbi is
a highly secure facility.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.772
Safer to stay here
until we understand the threat.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.532
Secret service will designate
this "the castle."

14:11.550 --> 14:14.303
It becomes the president's
location in an attack.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.515
This is the last position
to fall.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.784
Finley, I think we do
understand the threat.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.849
This has to be gibson.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.982
Generator is up. We have power.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.821
How long will we be blind?

14:25.830 --> 14:28.219
A day. We'll have
no communications.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.551
We'll have no access
to surveillance systems.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.822
But neither will our enemies.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.560
We will have enough time
to do what needs to be done.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.333
Are you ready to get to work?

14:37.340 --> 14:39.934
Doing what, exactly?

14:41.480 --> 14:45.200
Mr. President, we've confirmed
this is a cyber attack.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.644
The virus is passing
from node to node,

14:47.650 --> 14:50.312
Crippling networked
computer systems as it goes.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.811
We don't know who launched it,
but we know it began here

14:52.820 --> 14:55.311
In d.C. And it's spreading.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.154
The eastern seaboard will be
crippled in the next few hours.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.089
Widener:
Sir, they've identified
the code as a variant

15:07.100 --> 15:09.091
_ On a _known_
chinese military Virus.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.001
If this is intentional,
it's an act of war.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.530
When the secure links are up,
I want a threat assessment

15:15.540 --> 15:17.906
From you, the joint chiefs and
the national security advisor.

15:17.910 --> 15:19.946
Yes, sir.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.211
Mr. President,

15:26.220 --> 15:28.541
This may not be
a military action.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.120
This could be a parent working
for the kidnapper.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.121
What makes you think that?
Sir, we
have units

15:33.130 --> 15:35.553
Searching for the kidnapper
all over southern maryland.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.290
We believe we're close, but now
our communications are down

15:38.300 --> 15:39.790
And those units
are being pulled out

15:39.800 --> 15:41.688
To handle emergency situations.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.930
And you don't think
that's a coincidence.
No, srr.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.760
One of the parents,
mr. Meng liao,

15:45.770 --> 15:48.432
Is a cultural attach
for the chinese embassy.

15:49.410 --> 15:51.298
And it's a chinese virus.

15:52.810 --> 15:55.449
Agent finley, I just put
our bombers on 15-minute notice.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.873
If this is a parent trying
to save their child,

15:57.890 --> 16:01.212
I need you to find out before we
lose control of this situation.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.688
Understood, sir.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.994
You want me to make more
chemical supplement?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.764
Francis, I
can't do that.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.431
You have to.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.079
Why would you want me
to make more of this poison?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.172
I mean, you
can't give it

16:24.180 --> 16:25.647
To just anyone.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.901
You need soldiers
who've been conditioned

16:26.920 --> 16:28.239
And you don't have them.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.410
Freeing those soldiers
is the next step.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.648
And when the
time comes,

16:30.650 --> 16:32.140
We will do
that together.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.686
But without the supplement,
they're of no use.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.780
Why do we need
to do this?

16:36.790 --> 16:38.781
To destroy widener.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.827
Which is the only way
you're free of this forever.

16:46.970 --> 16:48.528
How much do you need?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.607
Olsen:
Mr. President.

16:56.610 --> 16:57.929
Dod is hooking
you into

16:57.950 --> 16:59.770
Th_eir communications
Intelligence unit.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.372
The national guard
is mobilizing

17:01.380 --> 17:03.519
_To maintain
CIVII order, Sir.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.044
Hospitals across d.C.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.881
Are running on
emergency generators

17:06.890 --> 17:09.552
And handling the increased flow
of shutdown-related injuries.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.118
Which is good news,

17:11.130 --> 17:14.156
Because traffic control systems
are going down

17:14.160 --> 17:15.491
In many parts
of the city.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.149
We've got street cops
directing traffic

17:17.170 --> 17:18.558
At key intersections.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.367
We're adapting as best we can,

17:20.370 --> 17:22.031
Falling back on older,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.531
Non-networked technologies
wherever possible.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.962
Fbi tech:
These will work, they
don't depend on a network.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.198
You can talk
to each other

17:27.210 --> 17:28.973
Or talk back here
to the base.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.208
You got a ten-mile
range, got it?

17:30.210 --> 17:31.632
Thanks.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.242
Assuming this is
jin liao's parents,

17:33.250 --> 17:36.139
How are we gonna find them?

17:36.150 --> 17:37.447
The cell networks are
down; that won't work.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.308
Address book works just fine.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.919
(hissing)

17:58.870 --> 18:00.428
Jin, we need
to talk.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.759
Better do it quick.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.270
They just took
my proof of life pic.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.838
I'm going home.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.102
Maybe.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.680
What do you...
What do you mean?

18:09.680 --> 18:11.341
I really hope
you are, jin,

18:11.350 --> 18:13.011
But they took amber's
proof of life pic

18:13.020 --> 18:14.317
And she's still here.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.410
My dad's
preparing a plan

18:18.430 --> 18:19.920
To get us
out of here.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.181
No, no, no, no.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.428
Don't do anything.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.193
Don't screw this up for me.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.462
Hey, we want to get out, too.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.131
They only let my mother

18:29.140 --> 18:30.869
Have one child, beth ann. Me.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.259
I can't screw this up.

18:33.270 --> 18:35.306
I'm all she has.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.778
Fine. I hope you get out.

18:39.810 --> 18:42.643
But don't say a single word

18:42.650 --> 18:44.379
About our plan.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.295
My son...

19:02.300 --> 19:04.860
I will never see you again.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.301
By the time you get this, jin,

19:08.310 --> 19:11.575
I will be in prison or dead.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.578
You will hear
many things about me.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.579
You will hear...

19:20.590 --> 19:22.717
About the secrets that I kept.

19:24.420 --> 19:28.584
I want to tell you
the only truth that matters:

19:31.830 --> 19:34.094
I am your mother,

19:34.100 --> 19:37.399
And I love you.

19:40.610 --> 19:45.001
I have only done what I must
to save your life.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.109
(crying)

20:02.630 --> 20:04.325
Are mr. And
mrs. Liao inside?

20:04.330 --> 20:06.298
Yeah.
They haven't left today.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.790
How long until the network
is back online?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.529
We're trying to
figure that out.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.235
We need one of you guys
out here, the other
one around back.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.141
(doorbell buzzes)

20:35.560 --> 20:36.822
Do not move!

20:36.830 --> 20:37.990
Put the gun down,
mr. Liao.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.195
I have diplomatic immunity.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.236
Mr. Liao, diplomatic immunity
will not stop

20:42.240 --> 20:43.491
A bullet if we

20:43.500 --> 20:45.900
Fire on you.
Put the gun down.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.764
We don't have
time for this.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.736
(exclaims in chinese)

20:49.740 --> 20:52.447
(grunts)
where's your
wife, mr. Liao?

20:59.050 --> 21:01.746
Is it true?
Is today the day?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.113
Yes.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.553
Central command contacted me.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.357
We have been activated.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.952
Today our nation strikes first.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.222
What are my orders?

21:09.230 --> 21:10.697
The americans will
try to find me.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.928
Stay here.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.329
Make sure they don't.

21:43.930 --> 21:46.467
Clear. Mrs. Liao
is not here.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.791
Did you receive a call
from the kidnapper today?

21:48.800 --> 21:51.496
I have nothing to say to you.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.636
Mr. Liao,

21:52.640 --> 21:54.164
Our countries could go to war.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.432
We need to find your wife.
Where is she?

21:56.440 --> 21:59.307
Dunn:
Do you understand
what she's done?

21:59.310 --> 22:02.279
You could lose your wife
and
your son today.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.419
How can I lose my wife?

22:04.420 --> 22:06.809
I don't even know who she is.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.185
You didn't know
she's a spy?

22:08.190 --> 22:10.852
20 years. A son.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.657
I gave her my life.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.480
She gave me lies.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.321
Please.
Just tell us where she is.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.161
She did not tell me.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.764
If she had,
it would have been a lie.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.593
Even so, for jin's sake,
I would not tell you.

22:34.610 --> 22:36.942
Grandmother:
My daughter-in-law

22:36.950 --> 22:39.680
Does not want me to live
here like a mother should.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.284
My son is weak, so I
live in an apartment.

22:42.290 --> 22:45.612
Sya put on some of my
clothes and took my key.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.654
She went there.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.150
Did she take
anything with her?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.525
Ma, stop!

22:49.530 --> 22:52.158
She had a bag
for a computer.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.821
The fix for all this
could be on that computer.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.137
Where is this apartment?

23:02.180 --> 23:05.069
(whispering):
Ian, we're doing it.
We're getting out.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.048
What? How?

23:07.050 --> 23:10.042
Mr. Gibson's making a plan-- he
thinks the searchers are close.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.177
We're gonna get everyone
out when they come.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.579
But we need your help.

23:14.590 --> 23:18.378
Yeah, I can help.
I know something
mr. Gibson needs to know.

23:18.390 --> 23:20.858
What?

23:20.860 --> 23:23.055
I was in the
downstairs bathroom.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.494
I just wanted
to be by myself.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.719
I didn't want to see these
guards or this place...

23:28.740 --> 23:30.890
Mr. Nash getting killed.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.269
Yeah.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.431
I know what you mean.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.533
There's a section
of the wall that was loose,

23:37.550 --> 23:41.042
So I lifted it off,
and there was this hole
in the wall behind it

23:41.050 --> 23:42.915
On the other side--
it was the kitchen.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.047
Are you serious?
Yeah.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.018
I saw the headquarters,
or whatever.

23:47.020 --> 23:50.911
It's like a secret way
of getting back and forth.
Wow.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.421
That could be perfect.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.920
Who else knows?

23:55.900 --> 23:57.891
No one.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.892
I was sitting here deciding
whether I should tell you guys

24:00.900 --> 24:03.869
Or just... Run by myself
'cause the odds were better.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.304
You didn't run;
you told me.

24:06.310 --> 24:09.302
And this will help beth ann's
dad get us out of here.

24:09.310 --> 24:11.574
You should be the
one to tell him.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.172
I'll find him.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.299
Do you smell that?

25:02.260 --> 25:04.319
(sizzling)

25:14.510 --> 25:16.102
Finley, in here.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.175
Dunn:
The attack came from this.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.988
Forensics will never be able
to recover anything from that.

25:27.990 --> 25:29.548
This thing is
still smoking.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.983
Wherever she is, she
hasn't been gone long.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.127
If she's gone.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.121
(door opens)

25:35.130 --> 25:37.690
Dunn:
If sya liao works
for the chinese,

25:37.700 --> 25:40.328
She's probably with the
ministry of state security.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.389
Sya liao will have
underground connections.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.289
How do we find her?
Fbi databases are
offline, metro pd...

25:45.310 --> 25:46.732
Freeze! Secret service!

25:46.740 --> 25:48.298
(gunfire)

25:51.980 --> 25:53.777
It's not mrs. Liao.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.041
(grunts)

26:04.590 --> 26:06.888
(gunshot)

26:07.560 --> 26:09.323
Where is she?

26:09.330 --> 26:10.888
Where is sya liao?

26:10.900 --> 26:12.527
This guy's not
gonna last long.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.395
(panﬁng)
(low groaning)

26:14.400 --> 26:16.368
We're not getting
an ambulance here today.

26:16.370 --> 26:17.860
He's gonna bleed out.
We have to get him

26:17.870 --> 26:20.532
To a hospital. He's the only
line we have on sya liao.

26:20.540 --> 26:21.768
Let's go.

26:29.450 --> 26:31.611
Reporter:
With the power and
communications grids

26:31.620 --> 26:34.339
ContinUIng to fa/i up and down
the eastern seahoaro;

26:34.360 --> 26:36.112
American m/litary activity
has increased dramatically

26:36.120 --> 26:37.678
In the east china sea.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.282
High-placed naval sources
now confirm

26:39.290 --> 26:41.554
That the u.$. Is readying
a m/litary response

26:41.560 --> 26:43.551
. To what is
a ch/nese cyber attack.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.768
And with the uss
ronald
reagan
current/y send/ng its
f-Hs

26:46.770 --> 26:49.466
To the very edge of the
chinese republic’s airspace,

26:49.470 --> 26:52.337
And armed conﬂict
seems /mm/nent.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.139
(sirens wailing)

27:09.490 --> 27:10.957
Gas mains are computerized.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.554
The system crashes,
and they overload.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.822
The virus is spreading.

27:14.830 --> 27:17.219
How are we supposed
to find one woman in this city

27:17.230 --> 27:18.788
When all of our systems
are crashing?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.062
Man (mumbling):
You won't.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.799
What's he saying?

27:24.670 --> 27:27.002
You won't.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.240
He's saying we won't.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.578
D_evore: _
I'm trying to av0id
an international crisis.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.911
Just do it.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.751
I just put the seventh fleet
in park

27:42.760 --> 27:44.819
So I don't provoke
a shooting war with china.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.981
The joint chiefs are telling me
that if we don't strike now,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.321
We're gonna lose the ability
to do so later.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.127
Someone give me a better option.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.961
I think we should get
putin on the telephone,

27:53.970 --> 27:55.289
Get him to mobilize.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.961
He's not a fan of the chinese
government either.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.131
And push us closer
to a land war instead?

27:59.140 --> 28:01.108
With a country that's got
two million soldiers?

28:02.540 --> 28:04.007
Anybody else?

28:04.010 --> 28:07.468
(walkie rings)

28:07.480 --> 28:08.879
Excuse me, sir.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.674
Dunn, that you?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.817
Yes, sir.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.515
Do you have mrs. Liao?
No, sir,

28:15.520 --> 28:17.613
But we can confirm
she's behind the cyber attack.

28:17.630 --> 28:19.621
It's the kidnapper, sir.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.154
She's doing this for him.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.559
Where's liao now?

28:22.560 --> 28:23.959
Not sure, but she has help,

28:23.960 --> 28:25.723
Possibly from the agents
she's running.

28:25.730 --> 28:28.324
They might think
that she's doing this for china.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.661
Sir, she could be anywhere
by now.

28:30.670 --> 28:33.207
We're not gonna find her
without help from the chinese.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.599
(sighs)
understood.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.447
I think I know how to get
the information you need.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.638
I'll get back to you.

28:46.590 --> 28:47.989
Copy, sir.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.529
Sir, I have an option
I believe we have to take,

28:53.530 --> 28:54.849
But you won't like it.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.498
Shoot

28:56.500 --> 28:57.899
Agents finley and dunn have
confirmed

28:57.900 --> 28:59.492
That this is, in fact,
a parent mission.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.266
Specifically, that mrs. Sya liao
is a chinese spy.

29:03.270 --> 29:06.706
Well, that's damn good work
if it's true.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.530
Unfortunately, we've lost her
in the mayhem.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.098
Her agents
are helping her.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.032
The only way we'll find her
in time

29:12.050 --> 29:14.245
Is if the chinese themselves
give us her espionage network.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.117
Give up a clandestine
intelligence network in d.C.?

29:17.120 --> 29:19.042
The chinese are never going
to agree to that.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.712
They will if we trade them
our best asset in beijing.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.085
And that will get
that man killed.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.217
This city is shutting down.
By tomorrow,

29:25.230 --> 29:26.754
It will be the country.
By tomorrow,

29:26.760 --> 29:28.227
Our cyber defenses
will have identified

29:28.230 --> 29:29.925
And eliminated the virus.
Do any of us

29:29.930 --> 29:32.091
Want to see what this country
looks like by then?

29:32.100 --> 29:34.568
Gabe, do we have someone
valuable enough to make it

29:34.570 --> 29:35.969
Worth it to them?

29:35.970 --> 29:38.530
Yes, sir. We have an asset
very close to the premier.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.236
But it's taken us decades
to get someone that close.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.538
Olsen:
Mr. President,

29:43.540 --> 29:45.303
If we're gonna stop this attack,

29:45.310 --> 29:47.403
Sya liao is the key.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.311
We need to find her, sir, now.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.140
I'll consider.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.342
Go.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.354
(sirens wailing)

30:06.630 --> 30:07.892
Gunshot wound.
He's critical.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.494
I need you to keep
an eye on him.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.617
Dunn:
What's the status here?

30:23.620 --> 30:24.939
The generators
are powering

30:24.950 --> 30:26.747
Life support, but trauma cases
are coming in fast.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.308
We're gonna run out of fuel.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.584
If we don't find
liao fast,

30:30.590 --> 30:32.148
It'll be hurricane katrina
around here.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.082
Death toll's
gonna go up fast.

30:34.090 --> 30:36.229
(walkie rings)

30:37.330 --> 30:38.592
This is dunn.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.295
I have the location.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.097
It's a chinese
government safe house.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.533
A church, actually.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.292
2211 draper street.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.801
Got it. That's not far
from here.

30:47.810 --> 30:49.437
I don't know when I'll be able

30:49.440 --> 30:50.976
To get backup there
given the conditions.

30:50.980 --> 30:52.845
We understand.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.618
Widener:
I hope your people
are up to this.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.372
We sacrificed a good man
to get that intel.

30:59.390 --> 31:02.609
Don't pretend you give
a damn about personnel,

31:02.620 --> 31:03.712
Yours or mine.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.813
Easy now.
We're on the same team here.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.786
No, we're not.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.519
You ever heard of a team
that kills their own players?

31:13.330 --> 31:14.763
Don't go there.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.833
You don't have evidence
to prove that.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.307
You don't
have eVIdence

31:21.310 --> 31:23.972
To prove a single damn thing.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.971
Maybe not.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.844
I know it was your guys
that worked over agent dunn.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.886
We're working
together today, gabe,

31:34.890 --> 31:37.586
But when this is over...

31:37.590 --> 31:39.410
I'm coming for you.

31:54.870 --> 31:56.235
(gunshot)

31:59.910 --> 32:02.208
Remember, we have
to take her alive.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.176
That just got a lot harder.

32:15.930 --> 32:18.558
Finley, we can't let her
get out of here.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.698
I'll go in.
You go around the back.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.199
We don't need to do this,
mrs. Liao!

32:28.210 --> 32:29.507
Put down your weapon!

32:31.910 --> 32:34.970
I don't want to hurt you.
Please.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.448
Put your weapon down
and come out.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.448
(gunshots)

32:57.240 --> 32:59.231
(gunshot)

33:08.950 --> 33:11.942
We can't waste time on this guy.
Olsen said this is the place.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.986
We have to find her
before she runs.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.249
(sirens wailing)

33:27.530 --> 33:30.966
Sir, blackouts and fires
have spread to delaware.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.803
I-95 is shut down
south of philadelphia

33:33.810 --> 33:37.473
By a refinery explosion--
computer failure again.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.643
Eastern seaboard
is cut in half.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.040
And, so far, our
confirmed death toll...

33:44.050 --> 33:46.689
Is 75, and rising fast.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.248
(sighs)

33:52.990 --> 33:54.651
I am not armed.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.992
Can the virus
be stopped?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.956
It will not be.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.120
You got a call from
the kidnapper this morning.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.563
Yes.

34:04.570 --> 34:05.992
You uploaded a
virus for him?

34:06.010 --> 34:08.467
Yes. My government is not
responsible for this.

34:09.740 --> 34:11.071
They'll court-martial you.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.303
You mean they'll execute me.

34:15.320 --> 34:19.814
Yes, but I've only done
what I must to save my son.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.080
This ends now.

34:25.090 --> 34:27.149
I've been trained to
withstand torture.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.685
Whatever you do to me, I can
hold out as long as I must.

34:29.700 --> 34:31.327
I'm sure
you think so.

35:05.060 --> 35:09.064
You're asking me
to kill my son.

35:09.070 --> 35:12.096
I'm asking you
to save many sons.

35:26.650 --> 35:29.118
(electronic buzzing)

35:29.120 --> 35:32.658
What happened? This is too soon.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.878
Jonas.
(door opens)

35:34.900 --> 35:37.755
How long until
your work is done?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.694
At least two hours.

35:41.570 --> 35:43.094
What's wrong?

35:43.100 --> 35:45.398
Mrs. Liao's the only one who
could have stopped that virus.

35:45.410 --> 35:48.629
She was told to keep
them blind for 12 hours.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.699
(sighs) she failed.

35:52.810 --> 35:55.472
The most important parent
mission is still to come.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.415
That parent must know
the price of failure.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.825
(quiet sobbing)

36:29.520 --> 36:31.579
Who's there?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.953
Mr. Gibson?

36:37.960 --> 36:41.726
You're... You're one
of the kidnappers?

36:41.730 --> 36:43.425
It wasn't a dream?

36:53.240 --> 36:54.867
I did not want to do this.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.971
Your parents
failed, jin.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.277
Oh.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.375
Please.

37:03.380 --> 37:07.089
Please, please, don't.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.513
Please. You don't
have to do this.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.851
No.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.010
I do have to. Don't you see?

37:13.030 --> 37:15.180
They made me...

37:15.200 --> 37:17.259
They made me do it.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.488
(gunshot)

37:36.420 --> 37:40.015
(rhythmic beeping,
indistinct conversations)

37:54.570 --> 37:56.595
The region is recovering, sir.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.898
Network systems are
coming back online.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.537
The power grid
has been restored.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.599
Hospitals are
returning to normal.

38:02.610 --> 38:05.534
Communications for emergency
services are back up.

38:05.550 --> 38:08.269
Devo re:
So we didn ’t burn
our agent for nothing.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.909
Olsen_ :
lVo, an
The sacriﬁce paid off?

38:11.920 --> 38:13.717
Your team
is packed up

38:15.960 --> 38:18.884
When does the grid search
for the kidnappers resume?

38:18.890 --> 38:22.587
The units are already
redeploying back into
the field.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.693
We're gonna find
the kids, sir.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.960
(clears throat)
mr. President?
