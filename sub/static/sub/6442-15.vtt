WEBVTT

00:08.215 --> 00:13.881
I get to take home the souvenir video
of this when we're done, right?

00:15.389 --> 00:17.949
Jonathan, you can go ahead
and put your shirt on.

00:18.125 --> 00:20.184
How does everything look,
Dr. Scanlan?

00:20.361 --> 00:24.058
Well, I'm afraid the left ventricular
myocardium is still dyskinetic.

00:24.231 --> 00:28.190
-Why don't I like the way that sounds?
-Because of the arterial blockage...

00:28.369 --> 00:31.429
...I'm gonna recommend a triple bypass.

00:31.605 --> 00:35.336
You're only in the hospital a few days.
I promise, when you come out...

00:35.509 --> 00:37.773
...you'll feel better
than when you came in.

00:37.945 --> 00:40.914
Open-heart surgery?
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

00:41.081 --> 00:42.981
We've been friends for a long time...

00:43.150 --> 00:45.277
...and I know you can be a stubborn man.

00:45.452 --> 00:48.285
Look, given your
current condition, Jonathan...

00:48.455 --> 00:51.424
...you could have another
heart attack any moment.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.694
And the next time could be fatal.

00:56.797 --> 00:58.731
And the surgery could be fatal too?

00:58.999 --> 01:00.261
Trust me.

01:00.434 --> 01:02.197
You stand a far greater risk...

01:02.603 --> 01:04.537
...if you don't have this operation.

01:05.406 --> 01:07.431
Come on!

01:09.143 --> 01:10.610
Garrett?

01:10.778 --> 01:12.211
Garrett.

01:15.949 --> 01:17.849
Thanks, Clark.

01:20.521 --> 01:23.888
You figure after a couple months,
it'd like me better.

01:25.025 --> 01:27.425
I thought your dad was out of the woods.

01:27.594 --> 01:29.084
So did l.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.891
But here we are again.

01:32.566 --> 01:35.228
How's your brother doing, Garrett?

01:39.239 --> 01:41.469
In serious need of a new liver.

01:41.642 --> 01:45.703
If he doesn't get one soon, I don't
know how much time he's got left.

01:46.113 --> 01:50.607
Of course, if he knew I was out here,
instead of hitting the books, he'd pitch a fit.

01:52.386 --> 01:54.718
What's it looking like for your dad?

01:56.457 --> 01:58.118
They're talking open-heart surgery.

01:58.292 --> 02:02.695
With everything you've told me about your
father, it should be a walk in the park.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.630
You know, Garrett...

02:08.134 --> 02:11.332
...I always thought of my dad
as a man of steel.

02:12.372 --> 02:14.465
I guess I was wrong.

02:14.908 --> 02:16.842
Clark.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.302
Your dad's gonna have that surgery.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.347
And my brother's gonna get
that transplant. A year from now...

02:22.516 --> 02:26.282
...we'll all get together and laugh
about how freaked out we both were.

02:28.455 --> 02:29.820
Yeah.

02:30.891 --> 02:33.052
Code blue, room 247.

02:33.227 --> 02:35.161
Code blue, room 247.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.763
God, that's Vince's room.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.000
No. Another milligram of
epi. Come on. Charging.

02:45.205 --> 02:47.002
Clear.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.005
-No response. Still V-tach.
-Vince.

02:49.176 --> 02:51.644
-Hey, get him out of here. Out of here!
-Vince?

02:52.513 --> 02:55.812
-No, come on.
-No!

02:55.983 --> 02:57.416
No, Vince!

02:58.118 --> 02:59.779
Vince, please!

02:59.953 --> 03:03.719
-Vince! Not yet!
-Come on.

03:03.891 --> 03:06.724
-Come on.
-Don't die.

03:12.266 --> 03:14.564
All right, let's call it.

03:17.037 --> 03:19.062
Time of death, 2:43 p.m.

03:27.147 --> 03:28.444
I'm sorry, son.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074

04:40.621 --> 04:42.418
Poor boy.

04:42.589 --> 04:43.886
Where's his family?

04:44.057 --> 04:45.922
His brother was all he had.

04:46.093 --> 04:48.618
His parents died in a car accident
when he was little.

04:48.829 --> 04:50.956
Who's going to take care of him?

04:51.131 --> 04:52.655
He's got an uncle in Germany.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.926
It'll take him a few days to get here.

04:55.602 --> 04:58.571
-He said something about foster care.
-No.

04:58.739 --> 05:01.799
He shouldn't be there
the night his brother died.

05:05.078 --> 05:06.943
He can stay with us for a few days.

05:07.114 --> 05:09.844
Are you sure? What about dad's
surgery and everything?

05:12.552 --> 05:13.849
I overheard.

05:14.021 --> 05:16.182
Dad's not sure he's gonna have it yet.

05:16.723 --> 05:19.920
I'm gonna go speak with Dr. Scanlan.

05:29.936 --> 05:31.563
Hey, Clark.

05:32.939 --> 05:34.463
Look, I'm...

05:34.641 --> 05:38.304
...sorry to hear about your friend, Garrett.
How's he holding up?

05:38.912 --> 05:40.709
He's in shock.

05:41.148 --> 05:45.812
Guess that's what happens when the most
important person in your life is gone.

05:46.887 --> 05:49.355
I know about the surgery.

05:54.194 --> 05:56.628
Can you believe it?
I'm so popular around here...

05:56.797 --> 05:59.231
...they want me
to be admitted right away.

05:59.399 --> 06:01.367
So you're gonna do it.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.732
It's not quite that cut-and-dried, Clark.

06:04.905 --> 06:06.668
There must be a way around this.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.535
No, I heard the doctor.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.870
It didn't sound like that.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.077
I thought we talked about eavesdropping
on private conversations.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.947
If you'd stop trying to protect me
from this, I wouldn't have to.

06:23.890 --> 06:26.984
Dad, I see Garrett out there,
and he's lost.

06:28.361 --> 06:30.955
Just like I'd be without you.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.597
Please do this.

06:40.273 --> 06:41.968
Clark....

06:43.710 --> 06:45.507
Go out there and tell your mother...

06:45.679 --> 06:49.581
...to start filling out
all the admissions paperwork.

06:57.991 --> 06:59.754
Go on.

07:02.696 --> 07:04.857
And, Clark...

07:05.699 --> 07:07.997
...don't worry about me, son.

07:08.435 --> 07:09.959
I'm not going anywhere.

07:51.678 --> 07:53.771
I want you to know
how much I appreciate this.

07:53.947 --> 07:56.074
Oh, sweetheart,
we're happy to have you.

07:56.249 --> 08:00.379
Clark, I'm gonna go get some
things together for your dad.

08:04.124 --> 08:06.592
-Garrett, if you want to be alone--
-No.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.557
I really don't.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.260
It's kind of ironic.

08:15.802 --> 08:17.997
My brother worked in demolition.

08:18.171 --> 08:22.403
He risked his life every day with explosives,
and I lose him to liver disease.

08:23.977 --> 08:27.879
If he had just gotten
that transplant, he'd still be....

08:30.550 --> 08:33.383
Your dad's about to have surgery.
You don't need to hear this.

08:33.553 --> 08:35.851
No, Garrett, it helps to talk about it.

08:36.857 --> 08:39.381
You listened to me that time
in the hospital.

08:39.558 --> 08:42.823
Part of me feels like Vince
isn't really gone.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.791
That it's all just
some big misunderstanding.

08:49.669 --> 08:53.662
Garrett, if anyone needs to be told,
I can help. Make some phone calls....

08:54.007 --> 08:55.531
No, it was just us.

08:59.613 --> 09:02.639
He used to call me "runt"
as long as I can remember.

09:04.351 --> 09:07.752
I always hated it. Now I'd give
anything to hear him say it again.

09:10.557 --> 09:11.888
Garrett?

09:12.058 --> 09:14.322
I just got a call from the crematorium.

09:14.494 --> 09:17.327
They want to know where they
should send your brother's ashes.

09:17.497 --> 09:18.725
Ashes?

09:18.899 --> 09:23.336
What are they talking about? He's supposed
to be buried next to my mom and dad.

09:37.183 --> 09:39.174
Let's move.

09:45.025 --> 09:46.356
Syringe.

09:59.506 --> 10:01.667
Welcome back, Vince.

10:03.944 --> 10:06.378
Why have him cremated?
That's not what he asked for.

10:06.546 --> 10:09.174
We didn't send him.
Metropolis General did.

10:09.349 --> 10:12.341
He was helicoptered there
for an organ donation.

10:15.021 --> 10:16.989
Then it couldn't be the
same Vincent Davis.

10:17.157 --> 10:19.318
That's what the paperwork says.

10:19.492 --> 10:24.395
All the documents are signed, including your
brother's autograph on that cremation form.

10:24.564 --> 10:26.361
-No.
-Look.

10:26.533 --> 10:28.763
Maybe you didn't know him
as well as you thought.

10:29.135 --> 10:31.501
-What are you talking about?
-Garrett, calm down.

10:31.671 --> 10:35.471
How am I supposed to be calm when he's
been carved up and burnt to a crisp?

10:35.642 --> 10:41.239
-Look, son, I know this is difficult, but--
-You don't know anything.

10:44.317 --> 10:46.444
I'm sorry.

10:49.789 --> 10:52.087
Garrett, I know this is hard.

10:52.258 --> 10:53.782
Maybe Vince just didn't tell you.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.521
My brother's told me everything
since the day my parents died.

10:58.131 --> 11:00.827
Those documents have to be forged.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.470
I think your embassy would keep tabs...

11:08.641 --> 11:11.667
...on North Koreans who
have recently been deported.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.177
Seems like Dr. Teng has vanished
without a trace.

11:14.347 --> 11:16.281
It turns out that's not the only thing...

11:16.449 --> 11:19.145
...out of the ordinary
of our friendly molecular biologist.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.317
-What have you got?
-lt turns out it wasn't scientific research...

11:23.490 --> 11:26.618
...or academic prestige that got her
into this country 1 2 years ago.

11:26.793 --> 11:28.761
It was wedding bells.

11:29.229 --> 11:31.891
She married a rent-a-cop from LutherCorp.

11:36.169 --> 11:39.070
So my father arranged
a green-card marriage.

11:39.239 --> 11:43.938
Yeah. Now I tracked down the groom
so I could ask him what he knew.

11:44.110 --> 11:46.840
What did the lucky guy have to say?

11:47.013 --> 11:50.972
It wasn't really what he had to say.
It was more where he said it.

11:51.151 --> 11:55.349
He plays watchdog for the old
Metron Pharmaceuticals building.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.522
That's been shut down for seven years.

11:58.691 --> 12:00.056
Yeah, that's what I thought.

12:00.226 --> 12:02.251
But while he was telling me to get lost...

12:02.429 --> 12:07.492
...I swear I saw what I think was a
delivery truck pulling around back.

12:07.667 --> 12:11.831
My father's been strangely stubborn
about liquidating that property.

12:12.005 --> 12:14.405
Every market indicator says to sell...

12:14.574 --> 12:17.407
...but he insists the neighborhood
is about to be revitalized.

12:17.744 --> 12:21.009
The only thing being revitalized
in that neighborhood is the graffiti.

12:21.181 --> 12:24.947
Now, I think I can make some headway
if you'll just come along with me.

12:25.618 --> 12:27.449
Chloe, I should take it from here.

12:27.620 --> 12:31.613
-LeX, I'm perfectly capable of doing--
-This has nothing to do with your capability.

12:31.791 --> 12:33.418
I'm worried about your safety.

12:34.294 --> 12:37.457
When my father's involved
with covert research...

12:37.630 --> 12:39.427
...people tend to get hurt.

12:43.303 --> 12:45.271
I'm sorry I lost it.

12:46.506 --> 12:48.269
I guess I kind of have a short fuse.

12:48.441 --> 12:50.534
You have every reason
to be upset, Garrett.

12:50.710 --> 12:54.840
The thing is,
it just doesn't make any sense.

13:00.286 --> 13:03.449
-Vince?
-It's me, runt.

13:04.390 --> 13:05.948
Vince!

13:06.126 --> 13:07.821
I can't believe it.

13:08.628 --> 13:10.493
This is incredible.

13:12.999 --> 13:16.332
Wait, I don't understand. We both saw you.
You were pronounced dead.

13:18.471 --> 13:19.836
I guess they were wrong.

13:20.006 --> 13:21.564
There's gotta be an eXplanation.

13:22.142 --> 13:25.077
All I know is, when I woke up,
I was in a lab...

13:25.245 --> 13:29.477
...and this woman doctor with a needle
the size of Kansas was standing over me.

13:30.049 --> 13:32.017
Come on, runt, we have
to get out of here.

13:32.185 --> 13:35.313
-Wait, we should get you to a doctor.
-No more doctors or labs.

13:35.488 --> 13:38.082
-Garrett and I have to fall off the radar.
-Why?

13:38.258 --> 13:40.624
-Who's after you?
-I don't know, but....

13:41.828 --> 13:44.092
Can you tell me where the lab is?

13:46.699 --> 13:47.927
It's....

13:48.101 --> 13:52.470
-It's somewhere in Metropolis.
-Are you okay?

13:54.340 --> 13:56.570
Garrett, what's wrong?

13:57.544 --> 13:59.136
Vince?

14:00.180 --> 14:02.080
Your eyes.

14:02.348 --> 14:04.782
They're bleeding.

14:13.326 --> 14:14.850
Vince?

14:16.362 --> 14:17.624
Vince?

14:17.797 --> 14:20.288
What's happening to him?

14:21.134 --> 14:22.761
Vince.

14:22.936 --> 14:27.134
Vince, no! Clark,
you have to help him. Please.

14:32.312 --> 14:35.713
No, I don't know how to explain it.
This man was dead yesterday.

14:35.882 --> 14:38.043
He said he was revived
at a lab in Metropolis.

14:38.218 --> 14:41.847
Whatever they did, it was short-term.
He's not going to last much longer.

14:42.021 --> 14:43.955
His liver is rapidly deteriorating.

14:44.123 --> 14:47.854
Dr. Yeager, call the lab and tell them
to give him more of whatever he got.

14:48.027 --> 14:50.257
I have no idea what lab
you're talking about.

14:50.430 --> 14:51.954
Don't hold out on me.

14:52.131 --> 14:54.258
I'm not gonna stand here
while he dies again.

14:54.434 --> 14:57.198
Look, I've never had a patient
come back to life before.

14:57.370 --> 14:59.201
I'm just as confounded as you are.

14:59.372 --> 15:03.069
But I promise you, we're doing everything
we can to keep your brother alive.

15:04.877 --> 15:06.777
All right. Here we go.

15:12.185 --> 15:17.054
White male, early 20s. Six feet,
1 80 pounds. Originally presented with....

15:17.223 --> 15:20.192
I'm not sure coming back here
was such a great idea.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.955
There was no other place to take him.
At least they can try to stabilize him.

15:24.364 --> 15:26.832
I can't lose him twice, Clark.

15:43.483 --> 15:45.144
How's Dad doing?

15:45.318 --> 15:48.810
I feel like I'm being prepped for a
Thanksgiving dinner, and I'm the turkey.

15:49.822 --> 15:51.585
You'll have a good scar to brag about.

15:51.758 --> 15:53.658
What's happening with Garrett's brother?

15:53.826 --> 15:56.795
He's going downhill fast,
and the doctors don't know what to do.

15:56.963 --> 15:58.828
But he mentioned this lab in Metropolis.

15:58.998 --> 16:01.796
If I could find it, maybe I could
figure out what cured him.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.129
You need to help your friend, Clark.

16:04.570 --> 16:08.870
-No, Dad, I'm not leaving you.
-Clark, I'm in very capable hands here.

16:10.476 --> 16:12.967
Honestly, you're not good
at sitting on the sidelines.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.943
Garrett and Vince need you, Clark.

16:15.114 --> 16:17.878
-Yeah, but--
-Son, if there is any chance...

16:18.051 --> 16:20.349
...that you could save your friend's life...

16:21.454 --> 16:23.752
...then that's what you need to do.

16:26.893 --> 16:28.827
Dad, I want you to know....

16:30.296 --> 16:31.991
I do know, Clark.

16:37.236 --> 16:38.669
And I love you too.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.040
Now go on.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.869
Help your friend.

16:58.691 --> 17:00.249
Clark.

17:00.426 --> 17:02.860
I thought you and your mom
could use moral support...

17:03.029 --> 17:04.656
...and a little sustenance.

17:04.830 --> 17:07.265
Thanks, Lana. My mom
hasn't eaten all day.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.663
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.
I'll be back soon.

17:09.836 --> 17:12.270
Is everything all right?

17:15.441 --> 17:17.238
Do you know Garrett Davis?

17:17.410 --> 17:19.901
Sure, he and Vince used to
come by the Talon.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.205
Vince came down
with this rare liver disease...

17:22.382 --> 17:24.942
...and he needed a transplant.

17:25.117 --> 17:27.608
I'm guessing from the past tense
that he never got it.

17:27.787 --> 17:31.780
No. He died yesterday. Then last night,
he showed up at my barn.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.392
He came back to life?

17:34.560 --> 17:38.929
He seemed completely fine until
he started bleeding from his eyes.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.261
I've seen it before...

17:42.635 --> 17:44.432
...with Adam.

17:44.604 --> 17:49.405
I found this obituary that said he died
5 months ago of a rare liver disease.

17:51.878 --> 17:54.403
Did you tell anyone?

17:55.281 --> 17:57.272
Why not?

17:58.317 --> 18:01.150
Adam said if I told anyone,
they could be in danger.

18:01.554 --> 18:02.816
Where is Adam now?

18:02.989 --> 18:05.890
He disappeared. I haven't seen him
in more than a week.

18:06.058 --> 18:09.619
Listen, Vince mentioned he got an
injection. Did Adam ever take anything?

18:09.796 --> 18:13.095
Yeah. At first I thought it was
because he was a drug addict.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.235
But maybe that's what was
keeping him alive.

18:30.516 --> 18:32.609
Hey, runt.

18:34.053 --> 18:35.611
Vince.

18:40.193 --> 18:41.785
Vince....

18:43.196 --> 18:44.788
I'm sorry.

18:46.199 --> 18:48.326
What are you talking about?

18:48.501 --> 18:50.867
I have a disease.

18:51.037 --> 18:52.470
None of this is your fault.

18:52.638 --> 18:55.607
But if it weren't for me,
you could've had such a better life.

18:55.908 --> 18:59.571
You would've married and had kids
of your own instead of worrying about me.

18:59.745 --> 19:03.977
Garrett, I wouldn't have done it
any different...

19:04.717 --> 19:07.345
...even if you are a runt.

19:19.465 --> 19:20.727
Garrett.

19:29.609 --> 19:32.635
There's not much else we can do
except make him comfortable.

19:33.279 --> 19:36.339
Now might be a good time
to say your goodbyes.

19:37.216 --> 19:39.844
I'm not saying goodbye to anybody.

19:40.019 --> 19:43.386
-Son, I know this is hard--
-I'm not gonna let him die.

19:45.424 --> 19:48.257
Do you hear me?
I'm not gonna let him die.

19:58.671 --> 20:00.571
They'll be here any minute.

20:02.174 --> 20:06.440
Now, Martha, you and I both know
that there's a chance...

20:06.612 --> 20:08.671
...that things could go south in there.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.475
Don't say that, please.

20:10.650 --> 20:13.915
Now, there's no doubt in my mind
that you and Clark can take...

20:14.086 --> 20:18.250
...good care of each other.
But you have to remember our promise.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.824
When he's ready...

20:20.993 --> 20:22.688
...you have to let him go.

20:22.862 --> 20:24.955
When that day comes...

20:25.131 --> 20:27.656
...you'll be standing right beside me.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.241
We're ready.

20:44.116 --> 20:47.051
Clark, I can run with this if you
wanna be with your dad.

20:47.219 --> 20:52.179
It's all right, he knows I'm here. It also takes
my mind off the fact that I can't do anything.

20:52.358 --> 20:55.156
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:56.762 --> 20:59.287
We need to figure out
what brought Vince back to life.

20:59.465 --> 21:03.663
Well, it looks like my contact
at Metropolis General e-mailed me.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.668
The only organ donors who arrived
yesterday were both females.

21:10.042 --> 21:13.443
That means the medevac chopper
took Garrett's brother somewhere else.

21:13.613 --> 21:15.513
Seems that flyboy is the one to talk to.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.189
Are you Ben Powell?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.827
What's it to you?

21:28.995 --> 21:31.759
Where'd you take that body yesterday?

21:32.398 --> 21:37.301
Look, I don't know what kind of game you're
playing, but I'm an emergency medical pilot.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.598
You left to take a body to Metropolis
General and it never arrived.

21:40.773 --> 21:43.901
I'm not a lawyer, but I guess you could
do some serious jail time...

21:44.076 --> 21:47.512
...for using a medevac helicopter
for your own profit.

21:49.048 --> 21:50.606
What do you want?

21:50.783 --> 21:52.876
Take me where you took
Vincent Davis.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.497
What is this place?

22:15.675 --> 22:18.735
They pay me cash. I don't ask questions.

22:58.584 --> 22:59.949
Who's there?

23:00.119 --> 23:03.282
-I thought I'd never see you again.
-What are you doing here?

23:03.456 --> 23:05.617
So this is where you were deported to.

23:05.991 --> 23:09.358
I can only imagine the moves you used
to sway the immigration officers.

23:09.528 --> 23:12.019
How did you get past security?

23:12.198 --> 23:16.532
As I'm sure you're well aware,
this building is owned by LuthorCorp.

23:16.702 --> 23:19.762
Family name tends to open doors.

23:24.443 --> 23:26.911
Now, this looks familiar.

23:27.279 --> 23:30.373
It's identical to the vial found
in Adam Knight's apartment.

23:31.784 --> 23:34.150
It's a very delicate substance.

23:36.789 --> 23:39.257
If you don't leave at once,
I'm notifying your father.

23:39.425 --> 23:42.360
Can't you just send me
to the principal instead?

23:42.528 --> 23:44.655
I offered to fund your research, doctor.

23:44.830 --> 23:46.525
You turned your back on me.

23:46.699 --> 23:50.157
I suggest you tell me the origin
of your little blood-platelet cocktail...

23:50.336 --> 23:52.804
...or I'll make sure lNS
reserves you a window seat...

23:52.972 --> 23:55.236
...on the next flight to Pyongyang.

23:55.674 --> 23:57.665
Something tells me
they don't look kindly...

23:57.843 --> 24:01.074
...on North Koreans doing illegal
research on American soil.

24:11.423 --> 24:13.653
Where did it go?

24:16.862 --> 24:18.420
What did you just do?

24:26.839 --> 24:28.636
Are you ready to proceed?

24:29.642 --> 24:31.041
Yes.

24:31.210 --> 24:32.802
Go ahead, start it.

24:32.978 --> 24:35.879
I want two more milligrams of
potassium chloride in the lV.

24:36.048 --> 24:37.310
Yes, doctor.

24:37.483 --> 24:39.280
-Vitals?
-Pulse has leveled off at 80.

24:39.451 --> 24:41.248
BP, 1 20/70.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.910
EKG normal.

24:43.489 --> 24:46.322
-Blood ox?
-98 percent, normal.

24:46.492 --> 24:50.155
Okay, Jonathan, we're gonna have
you out of here in no time.

24:56.068 --> 24:58.935
I suppose all we can do now is wait.

24:59.104 --> 25:00.969
Mr. Kent's strong.

25:01.140 --> 25:04.007
He's gonna fight through this.

25:04.176 --> 25:05.507
Oh, Pete.

25:05.945 --> 25:08.106
I wasn't sure if you guys
wanted your space...

25:08.280 --> 25:10.475
...but I thought I should be here.

25:10.649 --> 25:12.776
I'm so glad you came.

25:12.952 --> 25:14.317
Where's Clark?

25:14.486 --> 25:15.976
-He'll be right back.
-Okay.

25:16.155 --> 25:18.214
Dr. Yeager!

25:20.259 --> 25:23.558
Where is Dr. Yeager?

25:24.263 --> 25:26.322
I want to speak to Dr. Yeager!

25:26.498 --> 25:29.365
-What do you think you're doing?
-My brother needs a liver.

25:31.637 --> 25:33.901
So I figure now you'll get him one.

25:34.506 --> 25:37.634
Garrett, this isn't gonna solve anything.

25:37.810 --> 25:39.209
Don't come any closer.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.640
If you want anyone to leave
with their limbs attached...

25:43.816 --> 25:47.013
...you'd better make sure
my brother gets that transplant.

25:59.698 --> 26:02.690
We need you to stay
behind the barricade at this time.

26:02.868 --> 26:07.498
Everyone, please stay behind the barricade.
This is a high-alert situation.

26:15.547 --> 26:17.640
-Sheriff!
-Just hold it.

26:17.816 --> 26:21.252
Hey, not now, Mr. Kent. Now if you
can't tell, I am a little busy here.

26:21.420 --> 26:23.718
My parents are in there.
My dad's having surgery.

26:23.889 --> 26:26.858
Please. What's going on?

26:27.026 --> 26:29.085
Let him go.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.824
There is a kid in there...

26:35.000 --> 26:39.061
...who is gonna blow this place to kingdom
come unless his brother gets a transplant.

26:39.238 --> 26:41.001
Garrett Davis?

26:41.173 --> 26:43.971
-You know him?
-His brother doesn't need a transplant.

26:44.143 --> 26:45.735
I have medicine that can cure him.

26:47.646 --> 26:50.012
-Where'd you get this wonder drug?
-Doesn't matter.

26:50.182 --> 26:54.619
If you tell him I have this, we can prevent
anyone from getting hurt. I know him.

26:54.787 --> 26:55.913
He's just desperate.

26:56.088 --> 26:58.955
Well, desperate equals dangerous
in my book.

26:59.491 --> 27:01.516
Sheriff, please.

27:03.128 --> 27:04.527
Just get him on the phone.

27:04.697 --> 27:06.824
He'll talk to me.

27:11.770 --> 27:14.398
We have a serious problem.

27:14.974 --> 27:16.839
Clark can't help us in here.

27:17.009 --> 27:19.944
That bomb is laced with meteor rock.

27:20.112 --> 27:23.206
His family uses it
for their demolition business.

27:23.382 --> 27:25.850
More bang for their buck.

27:44.603 --> 27:47.265
Mrs. Kent, you're a nice lady.
I don't want to hurt you.

27:47.439 --> 27:49.703
Don't do this, Garrett.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.775
It's not what your brother would want.

27:51.944 --> 27:54.276
I know exactly what my brother wanted.

27:54.446 --> 27:56.710
A transplant, and to see me
graduate high school.

27:56.882 --> 27:58.782
I'm gonna make sure he gets
both of those.

27:58.951 --> 28:01.943
Even if I have to be locked up
when I get that diploma.

28:10.029 --> 28:12.657
-Yeah?
-Garrett, it's Clark.

28:12.831 --> 28:16.699
I tracked down the lab they took Vince to,
and I grabbed a vial of the medicine.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.302
I'm holding it right here.

28:19.571 --> 28:22.768
-Why should I trust you?
-Because I've done nothing but try to help.

28:24.176 --> 28:26.269
Okay, come in, but just you.

28:26.445 --> 28:29.141
No. I will not allow that.

28:29.581 --> 28:31.549
I'll get one of my deputies
to bring it in.

28:31.717 --> 28:33.150
It's Clark or no one.

28:36.088 --> 28:37.555
You have to let the hostages go.

28:41.794 --> 28:45.195
That's the only way they're
even gonna think about letting me in.

29:12.157 --> 29:13.419
Clark.

29:13.592 --> 29:15.219
-Mom, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

29:15.661 --> 29:18.994
Your father's still in the operating room.
Garrett means what he says.

29:19.164 --> 29:22.065
I need to get this to Vince,
then I'll take care of the bomb.

29:22.234 --> 29:24.794
Clark, you may not be able to.

29:25.604 --> 29:29.165
It's made with kryptonite. Be careful.

29:34.813 --> 29:37.213
There is too much at stake here.

29:37.382 --> 29:38.974
You find a good vantage point.

29:39.151 --> 29:42.348
You get a clean shot. You take him out.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.892
Garrett.

29:51.630 --> 29:52.892
Where is it?

29:53.665 --> 29:56.065
It's right here.

30:02.307 --> 30:05.276
-What are you doing?
-You have a bomb strapped to your chest.

30:05.444 --> 30:07.912
I prefer to just keep my distance.

30:20.159 --> 30:22.684
Is it supposed to do this?

30:23.095 --> 30:24.392
I don't know.

30:28.066 --> 30:30.534
Doctor?

30:32.905 --> 30:35.567
I need you to give my brother
an injection of this...

30:35.741 --> 30:38.039
...in his chest.

30:41.446 --> 30:43.175
-What is this?
-Just do it.

30:44.917 --> 30:46.282
Please, just do it.

31:02.634 --> 31:04.465
What are you waiting for?

31:05.537 --> 31:07.129
Hurry!

31:17.015 --> 31:19.108
How long is it supposed to take, Clark?

31:19.284 --> 31:20.546
I'm not sure.

31:26.592 --> 31:28.184
There's no change in his vitals.

31:29.561 --> 31:30.823
It's not working?

31:30.996 --> 31:32.759
-You lied to me, Clark.
-No, I didn't.

31:32.931 --> 31:36.697
-That's it. My brother's getting a liver now.
-We don't have one, Garrett.

31:36.868 --> 31:39.393
Yes, you do. You've got
a man lying in the OR.

31:40.172 --> 31:42.367
-That's my dad.
-I don't have another choice.

31:42.541 --> 31:45.476
-No, you're not touching him.
-Clark.

31:47.746 --> 31:49.145
You'll still have a mom.

31:49.314 --> 31:51.544
If Vince dies I have no one.

31:51.917 --> 31:55.978
-Son, the chances of success are very low.
-Just go.

31:57.322 --> 31:58.880
Now.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.656
-Doctor, you can't do this.
-I know I can't.

32:04.830 --> 32:08.823
But there are 20 other patients in this
building. I don't know what to do.

32:26.852 --> 32:29.343
You don't want to do this, Garrett.

32:29.521 --> 32:30.852
I'm sorry, Clark.

33:22.808 --> 33:24.799
Is everyone all right?

33:24.976 --> 33:27.410
Everything's stable.

33:27.579 --> 33:29.843
Let's continue.

33:37.589 --> 33:39.819
Your father wanted to cut off
his medication.

33:39.991 --> 33:42.653
He said Adam Knight's role
in the project was done...

33:42.828 --> 33:44.159
...but I couldn't do it.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.229
It was barbaric.
It would've killed him.

33:46.398 --> 33:48.923
That's why you've hidden him
down here from my father.

33:49.101 --> 33:51.626
Why don't we just keep the kid
on the medicine?

33:51.803 --> 33:53.828
The platelets are in extremely
short supply.

33:54.005 --> 33:56.667
You haven't told me where these
blood platelets come from.

33:56.842 --> 33:58.104
I don't know.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.234
Why would I lie to you?

34:00.412 --> 34:02.778
You're my only way out
from your father's grip.

34:02.948 --> 34:06.475
But I do know they have the remarkable
ability to revivify necrotic tissue.

34:06.651 --> 34:10.246
So why is it that all the subjects suffer
from the same liver disease?

34:10.422 --> 34:13.789
The cells in the liver are the
most resilient cells in the body.

34:15.793 --> 34:17.694
I want you to relaX, Adam.

34:17.862 --> 34:20.161
It's me, Dr. Teng.

34:33.043 --> 34:35.478
What's wrong with him?

34:35.647 --> 34:37.911
He's deteriorating.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.745
I told your father not to rush
the serum's development.

34:40.918 --> 34:43.251
But he wouldn't listen.

34:59.037 --> 35:01.267
I don't think it's gonna get much cleaner.

35:02.841 --> 35:05.275
What brings you to the far
reaches of the Talon?

35:05.444 --> 35:09.244
I thought I might be able to find a clue
to the former tenant's whereabouts.

35:11.850 --> 35:13.715
Why? He's gone.

35:13.885 --> 35:15.409
That's what's important.

35:17.856 --> 35:19.824
You wouldn't know where he is,
would you?

35:19.991 --> 35:21.424
No.

35:21.593 --> 35:23.993
I just want to forget
that he ever lived here.

35:24.162 --> 35:25.823
Yeah, I can see that.

35:26.498 --> 35:27.988
Lana...

35:28.533 --> 35:30.558
...is there something
you're not telling me?

35:33.605 --> 35:34.867
No.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.302
Of course not.

35:41.446 --> 35:45.109
I guess I'm gonna have to put
all his stuff in storage.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.419
Look....

35:59.498 --> 36:00.965
I want you to know...

36:01.366 --> 36:04.529
...if you ever feel
like talking about Adam...

36:04.703 --> 36:06.500
...I'm always here.

36:11.042 --> 36:12.566
LeX....

36:14.446 --> 36:16.471
Why are you still interested
in him, anyway?

36:20.585 --> 36:23.520
You came to me and asked
if I could get him out of your life.

36:23.688 --> 36:27.852
I'm just following up
and making sure he stays that way.

36:53.218 --> 36:56.676
Hey, thanks for the lift.
I think I can take it from here.

36:56.855 --> 36:59.551
Easy, Jonathan.
The doctor said to stand slowly.

36:59.724 --> 37:01.954
If I stand any slower,
I'll be standing still.

37:02.127 --> 37:06.029
Thank you so much
for everything. Bye-bye.

37:06.598 --> 37:08.429
Hey, Clark....

37:08.600 --> 37:13.902
It's all right, son. The doctor says
that the worst of this is behind me.

37:17.976 --> 37:19.238
Hey, Clark?

37:21.780 --> 37:23.975
What's bothering you, son?

37:26.284 --> 37:28.946
When I went to pick up the vial
for Vince, Lex was there.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.281
He was talking to one of the scientists.

37:31.456 --> 37:35.449
From their conversation, it sounds
like Lionel Luthor is behind all of it.

37:36.861 --> 37:38.692
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

37:39.130 --> 37:41.530
When the serum got close
to the kryptonite bomb...

37:41.700 --> 37:44.533
...it reacted the same way as my blood.

37:45.804 --> 37:48.898
-So you're saying the serum....
-I know.

37:49.074 --> 37:51.770
It sounds crazy, but I think
Lionel Luthor's found a way...

37:51.943 --> 37:54.207
...to use my blood to bring
people back to life.

37:58.550 --> 38:01.451
If my blood can save lives...

38:01.620 --> 38:03.212
...maybe I should come forward.

38:04.589 --> 38:08.047
What if something inside me could
repair dad's heart permanently?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.691
Clark...

38:10.762 --> 38:15.995
...your mother and I both know that you
are gonna save a lot of lives in this world.

38:17.002 --> 38:18.799
Even more than you have any idea.

38:21.640 --> 38:25.542
The only life I'm interested
in saving is yours.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.678
You do.

38:27.946 --> 38:31.074
You save my life every day
that you're with us.

38:36.655 --> 38:39.954
And we wouldn't trade that
for a single moment without you.

38:51.736 --> 38:54.569
-Hey.
-Hey, how's your dad feeling?

38:54.739 --> 38:56.764
You'd never know
he just had a triple bypass.

38:56.941 --> 39:00.001
My mom bought the doctor
a combat helmet as a thank-you gift.

39:00.178 --> 39:03.614
Only your dad could survive
surgery during a siege.

39:05.650 --> 39:09.677
I talked to Garrett's uncle.
He wanted to know what happened.

39:09.954 --> 39:11.216
What did you say?

39:11.389 --> 39:13.755
Well, I couldn't eXplain
Vince's resurrection...

39:13.925 --> 39:16.325
...but I told him that Garrett
was a good kid.

39:16.761 --> 39:18.285
You know, he was desperate.

39:18.463 --> 39:20.931
He wanted to do whatever he could
to save his brother.

39:21.099 --> 39:23.897
I should've said something
about Adam sooner.

39:24.069 --> 39:26.731
-I feel so guilty.
-None of this was your fault.

39:26.905 --> 39:31.171
Still, I let him threaten me into silence.

39:31.376 --> 39:33.742
Because you knew it would put
people in danger.

39:33.912 --> 39:36.142
I understand keeping secrets
for that reason.

39:36.748 --> 39:39.876
It was really hard
keeping it from everyone.

39:40.051 --> 39:43.145
It's kind of a relief to tell you.

39:47.492 --> 39:49.983
Lana, no matter where we stand...

39:50.161 --> 39:54.063
...I'm still your friend,
and you can tell me anything.

39:56.901 --> 39:59.028
You know that goes both ways.

40:04.909 --> 40:06.467
Clark.

40:08.379 --> 40:11.109
What do you think was in that serum?

40:14.018 --> 40:15.713
I have no idea.
