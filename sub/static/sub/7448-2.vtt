WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:06.039
Didi and Baba.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.839
What about 'em?
I know who killed 'em.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.440
Detectives Macarthur and Patton,
Mr Falconer.

00:10.441 --> 00:12.239
Where you blokes hail from?

00:12.240 --> 00:13.760
You'll need to accompany us
to the station.

00:13.761 --> 00:17.039
Fuck off!
Hold him!

00:17.040 --> 00:19.880
You're the dog
who murdered my grandparents.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.319
Police have identified
the body parts of a man

00:28.320 --> 00:31.359
found in six bags
in the Hastings River at Wauchope.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.679
So this is you
putting it right, is it?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.239
You dump him in a tidal river.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.879
Strike Force Tuno will investigate
the murder of Terry Falconer.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.119
We don't put a time limit
on clearing up murder.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.999
That said, I have every confidence
that Detective Sergeant Jubelin...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.559
It'll take as long as it takes.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.039
Frank O'Rourke?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.239
I know who killed Terry Falconer.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.239
Anthony Perish.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.839
Anthony Perish killed
Terry Falconer.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.880
Who's Anthony Perish?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.560
Mr O'Rourke, I asked you
who Anthony Perish is.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.519
Hang on, mate...
Follow me. Come on.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.440
Got somethin' to show ya.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.480
Tell me what's happening, Brownie.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.519
He wants us to follow him.
You better hang back. He's carrying.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.960
And he reckons a bloke called
Anthony Perish killed Falconer.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.800
Come on, ya fags! If I was gonna
shoot ya, I'd have done it by now!

02:33.280 --> 02:34.920
Well, that's a comfort.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.399
You ever heard of an Anthony Perish?

02:44.400 --> 02:47.239
That old couple, uh,
murdered in Leppington,

02:47.240 --> 02:49.359
eight, nine years ago,

02:49.360 --> 02:51.479
weren't they called Perish?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.920
That's right.
A murder that's never been solved.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.680
In you go, quick. Get in.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.679
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.479
Hey. Easy.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.959
It's alright. Yeah?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.520
Yeah?

03:24.760 --> 03:26.559
Now, take a look at this.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.839
Is that Perish?

03:33.840 --> 03:36.959
That's Muzz, his driver.
Cross between a bad smell and a dog.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.600
Muzz?

03:40.600 --> 03:43.639
That's Anthony Perish.
Rooster and Undies, right?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.360
Now they're the ones
you're after. OK?

03:45.361 --> 03:48.159
Rooster and Undies are...
Rooster's Perish.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.919
Undies is Andrew, his brother.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.880
Why did you assume
we'd know who Perish is?

03:51.881 --> 03:54.599
He's only the biggest speed and
ecky producer in the whole country.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.880
He's worth fuckin'
I don't know how many millions,

03:56.881 --> 03:59.279
killed I dunno how many people.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.079
Right, that's him.
You gotta piss off, hey?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.360
Parked out the front - everyone in
town'll know I've talked to cops.

04:04.361 --> 04:05.799
The car's unmarked.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.359
What about the secret symbols
you put on 'em, hey?

04:08.360 --> 04:10.279
What secret symbols?

04:10.280 --> 04:12.839
Oh, don't treat me like
a fuckin' fool, boy, huh?

04:12.840 --> 04:15.199
I know how you police work.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.040
I've told you what you want to know.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.720
Now, fuck off and leave me alone.
Go on, get.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.319
So, these victims
had a grandson named Anthony?

04:40.320 --> 04:43.039
Terry Falconer's name came up in the
investigation, but so did 20 others.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.719
Coroner's finding
was 'persons unknown'.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.638
So, this Perish might have had
motive to murder Falconer,

04:47.639 --> 04:49.600
but the hit was expensive,
it was elaborate.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.839
I mean, do we know
he had the clout to do that?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.999
Uh, last COPS entry was 1992.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.919
Perish was a minor target in
a drug operation that went tits-up.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.919
The undercover cops were supposed to
arrest him with 900 grams of amphets

05:02.920 --> 05:05.279
but he, uh... he bolted.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.519
Whereabouts unknown ever since.
And what about priors?

05:08.520 --> 05:12.519
Yeah, uh, 1990, offensive language.
Fined 200 bucks.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.439
History of violence?

05:14.440 --> 05:15.799
Nuh.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.279
Outstanding warrants?
Just that single drug one.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.799
That's it?

05:19.800 --> 05:22.359
So, Anthony Perish
is a foul-mouthed petty crim

05:22.360 --> 05:24.600
who hasn't been seen or heard of
in over 10 years?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.799
Great - doesn't really
sound like the profile

05:27.800 --> 05:29.440
of a calculating killer, does it?

05:35.400 --> 05:39.600
So, mate. Been thinking about
that 100 G you owe me.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.400
I thought we were all clear on that.

05:43.401 --> 05:46.440
Oh, I think we both know
you got a way to go to work it off.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.840
Yeah?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.759
What's the job?

05:52.760 --> 05:55.519
I need you to look after a bloke
that's being a bit of a problem.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.240
Took delivery
but never made payment.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.400
Funny how some people
get with debts.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.640
Gary Mack.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.879
Part-time dealer,
full-time shit-bag.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.239
Teach him a lesson
for say, uh, 15 grand.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.360
Plus, you'll knock
the same off your loan.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.280
How serious you want this lesson?

06:15.520 --> 06:17.160
Well, I want me money back.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.199
The target area's
the greater gluteus maximus.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.279
Projectile from a .22
will penetrate the flesh

06:45.280 --> 06:46.879
without causing loss of life.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.120
So, it's not a hit?
Just a cap in his arse.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.760
Hope it won't turn out like
the last job we did for this bloke.

06:54.761 --> 06:57.039
Damn it, Vito, I told you
that wasn't my fault.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.360
Oh, no, I know man, I know.
I was just sayin'.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.279
I should just tell Rooster
to take a flying leap.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.079
The guy's got credibility, mate.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.800
Fucking with him is gonna
get you serious repercussions.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.920
Whoo!

08:23.920 --> 08:26.039
The bullet,
so carefully aimed at

08:26.040 --> 08:28.159
just teaching Gary Mack a lesson,

08:28.160 --> 08:30.039
missed his buttocks altogether

08:30.040 --> 08:32.039
and severed his spine.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.080
Pretty serious lesson.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.359
Decker felt he was
out of Anthony Perish's debt,

08:38.360 --> 08:40.438
out from under his thumb.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.919
He was wrong.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.839
Tuno?

08:50.840 --> 08:52.559
We're making progress.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.919
We'd, uh, make it a lot quicker if
we had our own designated analyst.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.880
Gary, everyone wants more personnel.

08:58.881 --> 09:00.919
The whole of State Crime's
underfunded.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.759
If there's one thing the pollies
love, though, it's law and order.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.399
You want a budget increase,

09:06.400 --> 09:08.720
get the Minister some arrests
for show and tell in Parliament.

09:08.721 --> 09:11.079
Yeah, well, thanks
for the suggestion, Howard,

09:11.080 --> 09:13.119
but Tuno's got
200 persons identified.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.679
It's a little hard to achieve
results with four investigators.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.120
Well, the Falconer case was pegged
as a tricky one from the word go.

09:21.400 --> 09:25.759
Could be time to put it to bed.
Really? And do what?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.919
Right, what do we do -
we just let a crook

09:27.920 --> 09:31.239
who impersonated a police officer
and then dismembered a body

09:31.240 --> 09:32.719
just get away with it?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.680
A single extra staff member
can make an enormous difference

09:34.681 --> 09:36.799
on an investigation, sir.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.920
The Falconer murder, it received
a lot of media attention.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.959
Thanks for that.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.959
Yeah, you get 2 out of 10
for diplomacy.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.519
Got my analyst, didn't I?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.240
You didn't detect
the scent of burning bridges?

09:49.241 --> 09:51.479
I smell something nice.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.679
So, I've been to the jail
where O'Rourke did his time.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.759
Had a chat to
the prison guards about him.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.039
Lee, hey?

09:58.040 --> 10:00.040
This is the guy you need to
work up a profile on, alright?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.799
Him and Perish.
Whoa.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.559
Bit of work to catch up on, eh?

10:03.560 --> 10:05.879
O'Rourke had been inside
for about six months

10:05.880 --> 10:07.999
when he was bashed
in the exercise yard.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.879
Three blokes
kicked the crap out of him,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.439
with a little help from... this.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.919
Was it payback? A lesson?

10:16.920 --> 10:19.679
Guards weren't sure
but they said CCTV footage

10:19.680 --> 10:21.920
clearly showed him seeing
his attackers waiting for him,

10:21.921 --> 10:23.919
and going out and facing 'em down.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.960
What - he knew
he was gonna get bashed?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.320
What - he knew he was
gonna get bashed...

10:31.040 --> 10:33.119
but he didn't report it,
didn't go for help,

10:33.120 --> 10:35.600
didn't get any back-up, he just
walked out and got bashed?

10:35.601 --> 10:38.359
He's a seriously hard guy.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.919
Seriously deranged, more like it.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.040
And this is your informant?

10:48.360 --> 10:50.399
G'day, mate. It's O'Rourke.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.999
Change of plan.
Park near the local shops, 10pm.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.880
Mate, the arrangement
was your place this arvo.

10:55.881 --> 10:58.119
You know who could be
watching me house, right?

10:58.120 --> 10:59.840
You're not there,
you can go fuck yourself, alright?

11:38.680 --> 11:40.160
Get in.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.640
Go on, get in.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.360
Jesus Christ.

12:01.899 --> 12:03.899
You the boss man, are ya?

12:05.819 --> 12:08.379
Appreciate you taking the time
to talk to us, Mr O'Rourke.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.658
Hey.

12:15.659 --> 12:20.218
Darling, are you, uh... you OK?
You working late tonight?

12:20.219 --> 12:23.338
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I'm just, uh, working late.

12:23.339 --> 12:25.018
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

12:25.019 --> 12:26.739
OK.

12:30.979 --> 12:33.218
- The missus.
- Ha!

12:33.219 --> 12:35.378
She checkin' up on ya, huh?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.418
You wanna watch that, eh?

12:37.419 --> 12:39.138
Eh?

12:39.139 --> 12:42.618
You wanna tell us
how you know Anthony Perish?

12:42.619 --> 12:45.418
Through the Iron Bloods.

12:45.419 --> 12:49.218
His brother's a member.
So was I, once.

12:49.219 --> 12:51.099
For me sins.

12:52.899 --> 12:54.339
I hadn't seen him for a while.

12:55.379 --> 12:58.018
Then a few months ago,
Undies came around.

12:58.019 --> 13:00.138
And it's Perish all over, see?

13:00.139 --> 13:02.338
Makes out he's trying to
do you a favour.

13:02.339 --> 13:05.698
But really, he's getting you
in his debt, huh?

13:05.699 --> 13:08.218
And, so, you never accepted
any of the money?

13:08.219 --> 13:10.178
Course I fuckin' did!

13:10.179 --> 13:13.699
I say, "No thanks," they'll think
I'm against 'em, right?

13:15.539 --> 13:17.138
Anyway, Undies picked me up,

13:17.139 --> 13:20.018
and, uh, we met Rooster
at some restaurant.

13:20.019 --> 13:21.618
What restaurant?

13:21.619 --> 13:24.138
Dunno.
What suburb?

13:24.139 --> 13:26.059
I think they said
it was Newtown, you know?

13:26.060 --> 13:30.378
Well, Undies tells me that
the, uh, Bloods gave you a boat.

13:30.379 --> 13:33.698
Yeah, they did. But it's fucked.

13:33.699 --> 13:36.699
Well, what's wrong with it?
Lower leg unit's stuffed, eh?

13:39.299 --> 13:42.458
Well, uh, what would it cost
to get it fixed?

13:42.459 --> 13:46.459
A couple of grand at least.
But I got nothin', eh? I'm broke.

13:47.859 --> 13:49.617
Well, if I came up with
a couple of grand,

13:49.618 --> 13:51.339
would you... would you get it fixed?

13:53.179 --> 13:54.978
Sure.

13:54.979 --> 13:57.259
You wouldn't blow it now, would you?

14:00.579 --> 14:02.339
Fuck you.

14:03.939 --> 14:06.699
Fuck you. What's the job?

14:08.739 --> 14:11.338
They told me to take the boat north

14:11.339 --> 14:14.218
to the Karuah River,
near Bulahdelah.

14:14.219 --> 14:17.339
He'd meet me there, dressed like a
fisherman, with a couple of eskies.

14:20.939 --> 14:25.178
Well, um, we got someone
we need to get rid of.

14:25.179 --> 14:28.658
Now it's gonna be in, you know,
probably a couple of eskies.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.938
Well, maybe more than a couple.

14:30.939 --> 14:32.699
In fact, it could be
in a few pieces, eh?

14:36.379 --> 14:39.498
Put 'em in the boat,
head out to the shelf.

14:39.499 --> 14:43.298
And once we got past the shelf,
we throw the contents over.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.737
And he told me to bring something
to wash 'em out with after.

14:45.738 --> 14:47.619
Anyway, we'll take it out
in your boat,

14:47.620 --> 14:50.898
go past the shelf,
dump it, it's all good.

14:50.899 --> 14:52.859
Well, how are you gonna
clean out those eskies?

14:52.860 --> 14:55.338
Ammonia. Fucks DNA.

14:55.339 --> 14:58.899
You can tell there's blood
but not whose.

15:01.019 --> 15:03.779
Speaking of whose... who is it?

15:05.299 --> 15:07.218
Doesn't matter who it is.

15:07.219 --> 15:09.058
It's not you, is it?

15:09.059 --> 15:11.818
Fuck you, mate.
You're a funny fuck, eh?

15:11.819 --> 15:14.098
The fuckin' look on your face!
Fuck you.

15:14.099 --> 15:16.099
It wasn't till we left
that he let it slip.

15:17.539 --> 15:21.419
Hey, uh, you were inside with a
bloke called Terry Falconer, right?

15:22.499 --> 15:26.018
Falconer. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
for a second, yeah.

15:26.019 --> 15:29.579
I heard he told you
he'd killed our grandparents.

15:36.939 --> 15:38.578
Well, fuck it, Rooster.

15:38.579 --> 15:40.378
Don't you think if I'd heard that,

15:40.379 --> 15:42.578
you would have known about it
the next day, huh?

15:42.579 --> 15:44.539
So, you never spoke
about the Leppington murders

15:44.540 --> 15:46.018
with Terry Falconer?

15:46.019 --> 15:49.618
Mate, I met the bloke once,
for five minutes, you know.

15:49.619 --> 15:52.899
Barely even knew him by sight.

15:54.379 --> 15:55.658
Hello.

15:55.659 --> 15:58.898
Honey Bear,
are you coming home, ever?

15:58.899 --> 16:01.819
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

16:03.899 --> 16:08.258
She'll be askin' you to get
your teeth whitened next. Hey?

16:08.259 --> 16:10.458
Fuckin' hell.
The ball and chain, mate.

16:10.459 --> 16:12.139
You got a ball and chain there, eh?

16:12.140 --> 16:15.098
They sat in that car
for over three hours

16:15.099 --> 16:17.379
as Frank O'Rourke told them stories
about himself

16:17.380 --> 16:21.138
and about this mystery man,
Anthony Perish.

16:21.139 --> 16:25.178
But without corroboration,
that's all they were, stories...

16:25.179 --> 16:29.298
the tales of a man who seemed
as mad as a cut snake.

16:29.299 --> 16:31.378
He was settin' me up, see?

16:31.379 --> 16:34.778
My boat registered in my name.

16:34.779 --> 16:37.618
If someone saw something,
Rooster had my face in the frame.

16:37.619 --> 16:39.619
Or he was just gonna knock me
when we were out at sea, you know?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.379
Chuck me over the shelf too.

16:54.059 --> 16:55.779
Are you right, Frank?

16:57.619 --> 16:59.938
Righto, that's it, right?
We're done. Alright?

16:59.939 --> 17:02.298
Go on, piss off, you two,
and arrest the prick.

17:02.299 --> 17:05.138
Let's go. Get out.
Fuckin' move it. Go. Go.

17:49.019 --> 17:50.738
Babe...

17:50.739 --> 17:52.499
Go back to bed.

17:53.899 --> 17:56.418
You talk to the cops?

17:56.419 --> 17:57.899
Yeah.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.498
I gotta be at the salon by 8:00.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.498
How am I meant to
move this lot back?

18:04.499 --> 18:06.059
Get into fuckin' bed!

18:13.699 --> 18:15.298
Sorry, babe.

18:15.299 --> 18:17.459
I'm sorry. Yeah?

18:19.739 --> 18:21.539
You don't have to do this, you know?

18:22.539 --> 18:25.419
We can just jump in the car,
take off.

18:26.819 --> 18:28.059
Yeah, I know.

18:29.179 --> 18:31.178
I love you, OK? Yeah?

18:31.179 --> 18:32.819
You OK?
Yeah.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.659
Ever wondered why cops
wear big black boots?

18:51.660 --> 18:54.099
These days, not to kick crooks,

18:54.100 --> 18:57.059
but to do the hard yards
checking witness statements.

18:57.060 --> 19:01.899
And the yards that Tuno walked
verifying Frank O'Rourke's story

19:01.900 --> 19:03.499
proved very hard indeed.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.980
So, no-one remembers seeing O'Rourke
eat with these two men last October?

19:05.981 --> 19:07.019
No-one?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.699
Gary, there's close to
300 restaurants in Newtown.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.379
That's not including the cafes.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.100
And we can't even be sure
the dinner was in Newtown.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.699
O'Rourke's not sure himself.
Maybe there never was a dinner.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.779
So, what are we saying?
Perish has nothing to do with this?

19:18.780 --> 19:21.979
O'Rourke killed Falconer himself?
Then why is he talking to us?

19:21.980 --> 19:24.300
Why not just tell us to fuck off,
like every other bikie?

19:24.301 --> 19:27.219
What about Perish's family? I mean,
what do we know about them?

19:27.220 --> 19:30.540
The only one with a criminal record
is brother, Andrew.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.860
Yeah, Andrew Michael Perish.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.859
He was charged with murder
in 1995 but acquitted.

19:43.860 --> 19:47.899
Form for motor vehicle theft,
resist arrest,

19:47.900 --> 19:50.300
dangerous driving,
driving while disqualified.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.860
And he's a patched member
of the Iron Bloods.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.779
It's worth a look, Brownie.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.460
Frank O'Rourke's pointing the finger

20:00.461 --> 20:03.019
at a family that runs
a feed and grain store.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.619
It doesn't add up.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.058
There's bad blood about something

20:06.059 --> 20:07.620
between O'Rourke
and the Iron Bloods.

20:07.621 --> 20:10.259
You remember that crack about being
part of the Bloods for his sins?

20:10.260 --> 20:13.459
Maybe pointing the finger at the
Perishes is some kind of revenge.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.418
Maybe he's just an ex-bikie
who's done a shitload of drugs

20:15.419 --> 20:17.780
so he's paranoid and sees murder
contracts under every rock.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.699
Or he's an attention seeker.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.780
You know, makes up a story,
gets a bunch of cops to listen,

20:21.781 --> 20:23.379
treat him as someone important.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.819
If this is a strategy
to frame Perish,

20:25.820 --> 20:28.860
then Frank's a criminal
fuckin' mastermind.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.460
Let's go back to Frank, eh?
Walk him through it again.

20:34.580 --> 20:37.379
Listen, I was, uh,
hoping we could have another chat.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.659
Actually, I was hoping
you could come in here.

20:39.660 --> 20:40.899
Fuck!

20:40.900 --> 20:43.299
No, I... Frank, no, no.
We'll come to you.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.940
No, it's alright.
We'll come to you.

20:44.941 --> 20:47.739
Yes, Frank, they'll be totally
unmarked. Absolutely.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.500
And we'll be discreet as mice.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.499
Lunch ended 25 minutes ago, Lee.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.980
Sorry?
Lunch - it ended 25 minutes ago.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.219
So, you had no intention of
dumping Terry's body?

21:05.220 --> 21:09.299
Well, I had to let Rooster
think I was, eh? You know?

21:09.300 --> 21:11.259
How'd you get out of it?

21:11.260 --> 21:14.779
Well, the Monday before Falconer
disappeared, Rooster came round.

21:14.780 --> 21:17.099
I told him the boat
wasn't ready yet,

21:17.100 --> 21:19.060
bullshitted the motor
needed running in

21:19.061 --> 21:22.419
and then Rooster went kinda quiet,
and he said... he said, uh...

21:22.420 --> 21:24.820
Well, the dog's goin'
this Friday, no matter what.

21:24.821 --> 21:26.899
Perish said,
"The dog's going this Friday"?

21:26.900 --> 21:28.899
That's not all he said either.

21:28.900 --> 21:32.459
Yeah, and I'm gonna have
some fun with him first.

21:32.460 --> 21:35.499
Got him on tape, lookin' square
at the camera as he says it.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.619
Now there's no sound, you know?

21:39.620 --> 21:42.060
But get a lip reader
and you see for yourselves, yeah?

21:46.460 --> 21:49.100
Righto, it's just comin' up now.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.260
What the fuck?

22:04.340 --> 22:05.699
Shit!

22:05.700 --> 22:08.100
Pippa! Pippa!

22:09.980 --> 22:10.979
What?

22:10.980 --> 22:12.780
Babe, did you tape over
my security vision?

22:12.781 --> 22:16.539
Babe, that was supposed to
be a surprise.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.019
I told you, these are
very important, yeah?

22:19.020 --> 22:22.500
Didn't think one would matter.
'Course it fuckin' matters! Fuck!

22:24.020 --> 22:26.340
I just... wanted to
make you happy. I...

22:31.820 --> 22:34.020
I didn't know you still had
that outfit, babe.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.740
Still got all me old gear.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.460
Come here, you.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.580
She's a professional dancer,
this one, eh?

22:45.581 --> 22:47.739
Tap, Latin, jazz, swing.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.260
She could toe for her country.
I don't doubt that, Frank.

22:53.860 --> 22:55.739
Ah, well, you know,

22:55.740 --> 22:58.140
you'll still be able to
arrest Rooster without it, eh?

22:58.141 --> 22:59.980
You know?

23:03.700 --> 23:07.899
Oh, man, this Tuno gig's
not much of a job, really. Nah.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.460
I don't know how much longer
I'm staying.

23:09.461 --> 23:13.739
I'll give you a hand
with that. Get in here.

23:13.740 --> 23:14.900
Move!

23:19.740 --> 23:21.539
I have had it with you, alright?

23:21.540 --> 23:24.020
I have given you every opportunity
to succeed in this job

23:24.021 --> 23:26.179
and on every occasion,
you've spat in my face.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.019
On every single time.
I...

23:28.020 --> 23:29.859
Shut up! One, you're late.

23:29.860 --> 23:32.300
Every time I ask you to do
something, it's always a problem.

23:32.301 --> 23:34.819
And every time I see you, you're
eating some sort of fucking cake.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.539
Well, I...
Shut up.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.700
You just said that you don't know
how long you're going to be there.

23:38.701 --> 23:41.540
I'll tell you how long you're gonna
be there. None at all. Fuck off.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.020
Move!

23:55.580 --> 23:58.379
It's Anthony Perish, alright?
He's our number one priority.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.379
I want every bit of detail.
Yes, boss.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.740
And I also expect you to be across
the entire investigation, alright?

24:02.741 --> 24:04.939
All persons of interest, all angles.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.699
Nothing is too small on this.
Yes, boss.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.619
Alright, so, you look for patterns,
you look for connections, all of it.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.259
You are not to assume something's
not important. Understand?

24:13.260 --> 24:16.539
So, I'm doing
mobile phone tower dumps,

24:16.540 --> 24:18.939
document requests, agency sweeps?

24:18.940 --> 24:20.818
When it comes to your budget,
you think of a number,

24:20.819 --> 24:22.820
you halve it and halve it again,
knock off any zeroes.

24:22.821 --> 24:25.739
I do not expect miracles but I am
not gonna tolerate laziness.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.698
You want to stand around,
eating danishes,

24:27.699 --> 24:29.300
this isn't the job for you,
do you understand?

24:29.301 --> 24:32.940
I...don't like danishes, boss.

24:34.380 --> 24:36.659
There's a couple of other things.

24:36.660 --> 24:40.299
You don't need to wear a uniform.
Yes, boss.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.779
And I'm Gary.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.540
Welcome to Tuno.

24:45.540 --> 24:47.219
Alright?

24:47.220 --> 24:49.180
Take that with you.

24:51.397 --> 24:54.211
Half a year on
from Terry Falconer's murder,

24:54.298 --> 24:57.417
Strike Force Tuno
was running on empty.

24:57.418 --> 24:59.338
Round-the-clock surveillance
on Andrew Perish

24:59.339 --> 25:01.057
had turned up nothing.

25:01.058 --> 25:03.657
If Anthony was in contact
with his little brother,

25:03.658 --> 25:05.737
he was way too cunning
to get caught.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.497
Francis Xavier O'Rourke

25:07.498 --> 25:10.618
remained Gary Jubelin's only lead.

25:12.058 --> 25:14.577
Gary couldn't know there was
another man out there

25:14.578 --> 25:16.857
who would one day
answer the big questions

25:16.858 --> 25:19.377
about Rooster and his crimes.

25:19.378 --> 25:21.657
I've got premises all picked out.

25:21.658 --> 25:23.857
Nice little club in the city.

25:23.858 --> 25:25.738
You know, classy.

25:28.738 --> 25:30.218
Your own club.

25:31.618 --> 25:33.098
Your own boss at last, mate.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.137
I've always been
my own boss, Michael.

25:35.138 --> 25:37.898
Oh, yeah?
What does Rooster think about that?

25:40.298 --> 25:44.937
Decker's problem was
he had an inferiority complex,

25:44.938 --> 25:47.497
which made him do dumb things

25:47.498 --> 25:52.137
like trying to prove he was as tough
as his pal, Anthony Perish.

25:52.138 --> 25:54.218
Bad idea.

25:55.338 --> 25:57.937
You're not selling here. Piss off!
Piss off yourself.

25:57.938 --> 25:59.778
I haven't done nothin'.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.177
Like I said, bad idea.

26:15.178 --> 26:17.538
The kid Decker beat up on
happened to be the godson

26:17.539 --> 26:21.897
of the President of the Living Dead
outlaw motorcycle club.

26:21.898 --> 26:24.257
And Jasper Woodworth Pengilly

26:24.258 --> 26:28.458
took his pastoral care
very seriously indeed.

26:43.418 --> 26:48.017
It's not that I can't handle myself.
Just till things settle down.

26:48.018 --> 26:50.337
I don't know, mate.
Pengilly and me do business.

26:50.338 --> 26:52.137
Don't want to piss him off.

26:52.138 --> 26:54.257
And I sure as hell don't want
50 Deadheads

26:54.258 --> 26:55.858
combat-crawling over me front lawn.

26:55.859 --> 26:58.777
I wouldn't compromise a safe house.

26:58.778 --> 27:01.377
No-one will know I'm here.

27:01.378 --> 27:04.018
I can run a covert op.
You know that.

27:05.218 --> 27:08.257
I'd consider it...

27:08.258 --> 27:09.738
You'd be doin' me a big favour.

27:10.938 --> 27:12.698
Yeah, I would, wouldn't I?

27:24.578 --> 27:25.898
What?

27:27.218 --> 27:29.657
I don't know why
you bother with that dickhead.

27:29.658 --> 27:33.737
I know. But he knows his stuff.

27:33.738 --> 27:37.178
He's a cleanskin
and he does what he's told, eh?

27:40.418 --> 27:43.137
Boss?
You finished the Perish profile yet?

27:43.138 --> 27:48.298
Um, not quite. But I thought
this might be important.

27:49.978 --> 27:52.057
It's Frank O'Rourke's
manslaughter case.

27:52.058 --> 27:54.977
It might not be anything,
but it kind of goes to character.

27:54.978 --> 27:57.977
About 15 Iron Bloods,
including O'Rourke, were at a pub

27:57.978 --> 27:59.978
and this guy, Murray,
said something insulting about them,

27:59.979 --> 28:03.777
and a bunch, including O'Rourke,
followed him out and beat him up.

28:03.778 --> 28:05.778
O'Rourke had a tyre iron,
bashed Murray in the head,

28:05.779 --> 28:07.257
then he fled to Darwin.

28:07.258 --> 28:08.657
Typical bikie.

28:08.658 --> 28:12.817
I don't think so.
I looked at the arrest sequence.

28:12.818 --> 28:16.297
We never caught O'Rourke.
That is, we didn't arrest him.

28:16.298 --> 28:18.337
He turned himself in.

28:18.338 --> 28:21.257
I was wondering
when you'd get onto that.

28:21.258 --> 28:23.418
You want to tell us what happened?

28:26.698 --> 28:30.257
Well, I gave him a beating.
Yeah, I admit that.

28:30.258 --> 28:33.057
But so did eight other blokes, eh?

28:33.058 --> 28:35.417
And I wasn't the one who killed him.

28:35.418 --> 28:38.658
But you put your hand up for it.
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

28:41.338 --> 28:45.177
The bloke with the tyre iron, well,
he was the Bloods' main drug cook.

28:45.178 --> 28:47.017
Was makin' them a fortune.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.697
There's no way they were gonna
let that cash register do time.

28:49.698 --> 28:52.457
Eh? Me, I was just the muscle.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.417
Plenty more where I came from.

28:54.418 --> 28:56.138
They promised me
if I kept my mouth shut...

28:58.018 --> 28:59.858
they'd look after me, right?

29:01.098 --> 29:02.738
Best lawyers,
all the usual bullshit.

29:04.058 --> 29:06.817
Well, instead, I end up doin'
seven to nine for manslaughter.

29:06.818 --> 29:08.498
And for thanks, the Bloods
give me a boat

29:08.499 --> 29:10.778
with an engine
that didn't even fuckin' work.

29:12.018 --> 29:15.177
Perish and his brother, they're
associated with the Iron Bloods.

29:15.178 --> 29:17.538
Is getting back at them
your way of nailing the club?

29:18.938 --> 29:21.337
Maybe, yeah. A bit.

29:21.338 --> 29:24.257
But it's more about
that poor prick, eh, you know?

29:24.258 --> 29:26.378
He's dead 'cause I was weak.

29:28.778 --> 29:32.698
Joining the club, buying into
the 'band of brothers' crap.

29:37.138 --> 29:40.298
Now, I tried to turn
my life around before, eh?

29:42.978 --> 29:47.137
I even spoke to the Gang Squad,
tried to give 'em some info.

29:47.138 --> 29:49.098
You know what?
They weren't interested.

29:49.099 --> 29:52.297
For me trouble, I got a jail bashing
and one less kidney.

29:52.298 --> 29:54.818
Before I knew it, I was
back in the clubhouse anyway.

29:56.138 --> 30:01.417
My old man used to say, "You gotta
do the right thing," you know?

30:01.418 --> 30:03.857
"Even if it hurts.

30:03.858 --> 30:06.818
"The more it hurts,
the righter it is," he'd say.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.538
I don't wanna go back
to being weak. Never.

30:15.098 --> 30:19.417
Talking to you about Perish and
Falconer, well, that seals me fate.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.898
Yeah?

30:26.778 --> 30:28.777
You know I played
for Queensland?

30:28.778 --> 30:31.618
Is that right?
Under 16s.

30:32.778 --> 30:34.857
I was odds-on for a contract
with the Broncos,

30:34.858 --> 30:38.498
but did the ligaments in my knee.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.738
Undies?

30:47.818 --> 30:52.538
Still... not too late, I suppose.

31:01.618 --> 31:03.897
A few good years
left in me game.

31:03.898 --> 31:07.017
A few good passes left to make...

31:07.018 --> 31:08.497
What the fuck is that?

31:08.498 --> 31:13.018
Someone left us a gift
of a very dead snake.

31:14.338 --> 31:17.737
The Living Deads can't have
found me. I've been extra careful...

31:17.738 --> 31:20.578
You brought them here, to my house.

31:21.778 --> 31:23.538
We can't be sure
the property's been probed.

31:23.539 --> 31:27.218
Thanks to you, Jasper Pengilly
knows where I fucking live!

31:29.698 --> 31:32.578
You made this mess, Decker.
Bloody well fix it.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.319
Jasper Pengilly needs to be
neutralised using maximum force.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.119
Well, I got your back, Decker.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.759
Mate, you know I'm there
for you, any time.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.559
Good man.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.479
First we need to identify
the target's locale.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.360
Use the best time
and place to strike.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.199
Well, the Living Dead's clubhouse
is in a wrecker's yard down south.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.160
So, I just waltz into my enemy's HQ

32:03.161 --> 32:05.959
and say, "Excuse me fellas,"
and pop him?

32:05.960 --> 32:08.080
No... no. I was...

32:09.960 --> 32:11.919
I mean, you could always try JB's.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.199
JB? Fuck it, Michael.
I don't even drink bourbon.

32:15.200 --> 32:19.359
No, JB's Bar and Grill.
It's a pub in Chinatown.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.079
I mean, you could hit...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.279
You could hit Pengilly there.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.959
Why would he be there?

32:24.960 --> 32:26.999
He comes in every Tuesday.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.159
How do you know?
I work that door shift.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.519
I know what Pengilly looks like.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.719
Jasper Pengilly
comes to a grill joint

32:36.720 --> 32:39.959
in Chinatown every Tuesday?

32:39.960 --> 32:42.440
Has a royal rump and chips.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.159
Decker strikes again.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.080
I thought we could use
a photo of Perish.

34:45.081 --> 34:47.518
It's from 15 years ago,
but it's something.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.600
And I've finished his profile.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.520
This is it?

35:03.720 --> 35:06.639
This is all you've managed to dig up
on our major person of interest?

35:06.640 --> 35:09.559
Well, yes.

35:09.560 --> 35:14.599
Um, you see, Anthony Perish hasn't
ever had an account with Telstra

35:14.600 --> 35:16.480
or any of the private
phone companies.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.480
He's not registered
with the Housing Commission,

35:18.481 --> 35:20.480
Medicare or any private health fund.

35:20.481 --> 35:22.679
No super fund has any record of him.

35:22.680 --> 35:26.359
He's got no outstanding fines,
no traffic infringements

35:26.360 --> 35:28.959
but then the Motor Registry has no
record of him renewing his licence

35:28.960 --> 35:30.879
since he got it at 17.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.879
He's never applied for a loan or
a lease, he's never donated blood,

35:33.880 --> 35:36.160
he's never applied for
a business name or an ABN,

35:36.161 --> 35:38.679
he's not on the electoral roll,
got no tax file number,

35:38.680 --> 35:40.679
no credit history.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.720
I've never seen anything like it.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.039
And, so, what's your opinion on him?

35:48.040 --> 35:51.479
It's, uh... it's not really
my place to give one, boss...

35:51.480 --> 35:53.159
Gary.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.319
You don't have to call him
"Boss Gary".

35:55.320 --> 35:57.360
"The Masterchief" will do.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.959
My opinion is that only someone
with serious badness to hide

36:04.960 --> 36:07.200
would go to this much effort
to cover their tracks.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.480
That's good work, Camille.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.079
You know, Camille, however high
Gary's standards are for us,

36:23.080 --> 36:25.079
he sets 'em 10 times higher
for himself.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.360
But he said I'd done good work.

36:28.360 --> 36:32.560
No-one's praised anything I've done
since primary school.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.439
So, this Anthony Perish

36:43.440 --> 36:46.039
is your prime suspect
in the Falconer murder?

36:46.040 --> 36:48.398
Well, practically everything
our informant tells us checks out.

36:48.399 --> 36:49.998
Except the restaurant -
the one place

36:49.999 --> 36:51.880
you might get
independent confirmation

36:51.881 --> 36:54.559
that Perish was involved in a
conspiracy to murder, you can't...

36:54.560 --> 36:57.799
There was... there was a conspiracy.
There was a conspiracy.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.439
Our informant's got him on tape.
Where's your evidence?

37:00.440 --> 37:01.960
Well, the fact that we can find
so little on him

37:01.961 --> 37:03.439
is suspicious in itself.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.078
Mate, are you sure
this informant of yours

37:05.079 --> 37:06.520
isn't just leading you by the nose?

37:06.521 --> 37:09.039
He's not a bad suspect
for Falconer himself.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.520
Howard, I've been running fizzes
for 20 years and I am telling you...

37:14.120 --> 37:15.760
this guy is as sound
and as reliable as they get.

37:15.761 --> 37:17.519
Gary Jubelin.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.360
There's a helicopter
circling me house.

37:19.361 --> 37:22.239
What do you mean a helicopter?
Is it yours, huh?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.838
Sent your buddies to scope me, huh?

37:23.839 --> 37:25.520
We didn't do that, Frank.
Don't be stupid...

37:25.521 --> 37:28.119
Well, who is it, then?
You dropped me in it, didn't ya, eh?

37:28.120 --> 37:29.719
You told Perish I was doggin' him.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.800
Gets any closer, I'm gonna
fuckin' shoot it down!

37:31.801 --> 37:34.199
I'm gonna have to go. I'm sorry.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.999
I need to know. Is it one of ours?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.599
Uh, not according to POLAIR.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.239
And we checked with the hospitals
and the TV networks.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.040
None of them have sent a chopper
out that way.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.759
I've gotta go. It's him.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.239
Gary Jubelin.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.679
It's gone, right?
Well, where'd it go?

37:47.680 --> 37:49.598
It took off to the west.
Well, that's a good thing, Frank.

37:49.599 --> 37:51.800
It was probably just some rich prick
showing off his new toy.

37:51.801 --> 37:54.119
It was square lapping me house,
Gary, alright?

37:54.120 --> 37:57.320
You identify this
or I'm out of it, OK?

38:11.760 --> 38:14.080
Hey.
Hey.

38:15.240 --> 38:19.919
Apparently today was a bit of a
challenge, even by your standards.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.839
Thanks.
Here you go.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.199
Want to come in and have one?
OK.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.839
So, as if the crooks and informants
don't make it hard enough,

38:27.840 --> 38:30.200
now I've got upstairs accusing me
of chasing rabbits down holes.

38:30.201 --> 38:32.240
Enough to give you the shits.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.680
Well, you said
we have a lot in common.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.960
I'm really glad
you decided to come by.

38:45.961 --> 38:48.720
Oh, you remember what I drink.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.480
I remember every word you say.

39:01.720 --> 39:06.880
Listen, Pam.
I'm really glad you're here.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.360
And I really wanna be with you.
I do.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.040
But I need you to know I am not
the easiest person to be with.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.119
You're not the easiest person?

39:20.120 --> 39:21.600
No.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.600
What, just 'cause your own team
call you 'Crazy Fuck'?

39:28.160 --> 39:30.119
Crazy Fuck?
Mm-hm.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.160
Is that right?
Yeah.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.120
I'm prepared to give it a burl.

39:47.579 --> 39:50.778
But Gary knew the bosses weren't
going to give him any more staff.

39:50.779 --> 39:54.298
He needed to look elsewhere
for inspiration.

39:54.299 --> 39:56.058
Hey.

39:56.059 --> 39:58.218
Thanks for coming, mate.
No worries.

39:58.219 --> 39:59.339
Cheers.

40:01.179 --> 40:03.539
So, I was, uh, thinking
you might be able to help us

40:03.540 --> 40:05.858
create a bit of a...
a bit of a vibe.

40:05.859 --> 40:08.938
A vibe that Tuno's a bigger unit
than what we really are.

40:08.939 --> 40:11.659
How big do you want this 'vibe'?

40:13.179 --> 40:15.137
Yeah, big enough
so that these pricks

40:15.138 --> 40:16.859
think we're about to
kick their door down.

40:18.059 --> 40:19.618
Thought of applying for a reward?

40:19.619 --> 40:22.378
Tuno's not exactly the flavour
of the month at the moment, so...

40:22.379 --> 40:25.338
You know, posting a reward
is great media, Gary.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.337
But a recent photofit
of the suspect in the paper

40:27.338 --> 40:29.059
makes it look like
someone's been talking.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.858
It rattles cages.

40:30.859 --> 40:32.619
I might be able to
help you with that.

40:47.459 --> 40:50.418
Strike Force Tuno has recently
uncovered new information.

40:50.419 --> 40:52.418
We'd like to talk to these men

40:52.419 --> 40:54.698
in relation to the death
of Terry Falconer.

40:54.699 --> 40:57.458
We're asking for the public's help
to help us identify these men.

40:57.459 --> 40:59.578
And a $100,000 reward
has been posted

40:59.579 --> 41:01.578
for any information
that leads to a conviction.

41:01.579 --> 41:04.378
Every police officer in this state
is affronted by being impersonated

41:04.379 --> 41:06.778
in a kidnapping and a murder.

41:06.779 --> 41:09.019
The officers you see before you
are just the tip of the iceberg.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.778
So, make no mistake.

41:10.779 --> 41:13.738
Strike Force Tuno
is as committed as ever

41:13.739 --> 41:15.978
to bringing Mr Falconer's
murderers to justice.

41:15.979 --> 41:17.259
Seen this?

41:24.739 --> 41:27.538
Jesus.

41:27.539 --> 41:29.539
Who's been talking?

41:30.539 --> 41:32.898
Not me.
Someone has.

41:32.899 --> 41:35.459
Not me.

41:51.659 --> 41:54.179
Doesn't matter.
Cops are a bunch of fuckin' jokes.

41:58.339 --> 42:01.499
I'm gonna find out who dogged me
and I'm gonna kill 'em.

42:05.299 --> 42:08.059
Want some cereal?
Yeah, cheers.

42:38.299 --> 42:41.138
They have a name,
they have a face...

42:41.139 --> 42:43.978
You want me to wear a wire?
Against Anthony Perish?

42:43.979 --> 42:45.739
It's the right thing to do -
you know it.

42:45.740 --> 42:48.218
As they get one step closer...

42:48.219 --> 42:49.699
Hello?
Sergeant Jubelin?

42:49.700 --> 42:52.778
We've identified the number -
Anthony Perish's mobile number?

42:52.779 --> 42:55.139
..Anthony Perish is still.

42:57.499 --> 42:59.019
It's a warning.
You're scaring me.

42:59.020 --> 43:01.538
Some guy called Frank
says his life's in danger.

43:01.539 --> 43:02.979
I'm not afraid of you!

43:03.004 --> 43:07.127
