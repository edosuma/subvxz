WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:03.333
- HEY, RAY.

00:03.333 --> 00:04.933
- SHUT THE DOOR! SHUT IT!
- WHAT? WHY?

00:04.933 --> 00:06.967
- SHUT THE DOOR AND DON'T STEP--
DON'T WALK ANYWHERE!

00:06.967 --> 00:10.500
- YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT, MAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10.500 --> 00:14.267
- I LOST THE HAMSTER,
ALLY'S HAMSTER.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.033
- OH, NO.
HE GOT OUT?

00:16.033 --> 00:19.400
- YES, HE GOT OUT.
WHAT THE HELL?

00:24.033 --> 00:25.667
COME ON.

00:25.667 --> 00:26.667
LOOK, DEBRA AND THE KIDS

00:26.667 --> 00:28.100
ARE GOING TO BE HOME
IN AN HOUR.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.600
YOU GOT TO HELP ME
LOOK FOR HIM.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.667
- THEY LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR ONE WEEKEND,

00:31.667 --> 00:33.800
AND THE ONLY OTHER
LIVING THING IN THE HOUSE

00:33.800 --> 00:36.967
NEEDS TO RUN AWAY.

00:36.967 --> 00:40.467
- YEAH.
SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT?

00:40.467 --> 00:42.433
JUST HELP ME LOOK.
PUMPERNICKEL!

00:42.433 --> 00:44.233
- PUMPERNICKEL!
PUMPERNICKEL!

00:44.233 --> 00:45.633
PUMPERNICKEL!
- HERE, BOY.

00:45.633 --> 00:46.600
HERE, PUMPERNICKEL!

00:46.600 --> 00:48.300
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.200
YOU DON'T CALL HIM LIKE THAT.
HE'S A HAMSTER.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.300
HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS NAME.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.500
- WE SHOULD MAKE
HAMSTER NOISES.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.100
[lips squeaking]

00:59.733 --> 01:05.000
- [lips squeaking]

01:14.833 --> 01:19.167
[silence]

01:21.833 --> 01:26.067
YOU COULD USE A MINT.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.233
- [gasps]
YOU DREW THAT YOURSELF?

01:38.033 --> 01:39.233
- THEY'RE COMING!

01:39.233 --> 01:43.067
[Beethoven's
"Ode to Joy"]

02:02.900 --> 02:05.733
[music stops]

02:05.733 --> 02:08.567
[heart beating]

02:12.167 --> 02:15.033
["Ode to Joy" resumes]

02:18.233 --> 02:19.400
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.467
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME.

02:20.467 --> 02:21.733
- WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THESE CRUMBS?

02:21.733 --> 02:23.733
THE WAY DEBRA
KEEPS THIS KITCHEN,

02:23.733 --> 02:27.533
IT'S A MIRACLE THIS PLACE
ISN'T INFESTED WITH HAMSTERS.

02:29.933 --> 02:33.867
- HE'S NOT IN THE BASEMENT.

02:33.867 --> 02:35.433
- DAD, JUST SO YOU KNOW--

02:35.433 --> 02:38.333
WE WANT THE HAMSTER
BROUGHT BACK ALIVE.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.833
- THAT'S UP TO HIM.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.100
- ALL RIGHT, I CHECKED OUT
THE ENTIRE TOP FLOOR--

02:44.100 --> 02:45.500
NO SIGN OF PUMPERNICKEL.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.867
BY THE WAY,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.200
YOU SHOULDN'T HIDE VALUABLES
IN YOUR TOP DRAWER,

02:49.200 --> 02:53.433
AND YOU COULD USE
SOME NEW UNDERWEAR, RAYMOND.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.833
- I'LL PUT IT
ON THE LIST, DEAR.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.033
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, THEY'RE GOING
TO BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.300
I'M JUST GOING TO GO
TO THE PET STORE

02:59.300 --> 03:00.567
AND GET A NEW HAMSTER--
THAT'S ALL.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.100
- WHOA, WHOA,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.333
- WHY NOT? WHY NOT?
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.833
SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.133
- YOU WOULD LIE
TO YOUR DAUGHTER LIKE THAT?

03:07.133 --> 03:08.800
- I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.000
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY,
"HERE'S YOUR HAMSTER, HONEY."

03:12.000 --> 03:14.367
- I'M TELLING ALLY.

03:14.367 --> 03:15.933
- WILL YOU JUST
MIND YOUR BUSINESS?

03:15.933 --> 03:18.267
- LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FIND ONE THAT LOOKS THE SAME.

03:18.267 --> 03:22.000
- OH, YEAH, WHERE AM I GOING
TO FIND A BROWN HAMSTER?

03:23.567 --> 03:25.533
- I CANNOT BE A PARTY
TO THAT LIE.

03:25.533 --> 03:29.067
- YOU JUST KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT, COPPER.

03:32.033 --> 03:33.367
- DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.633
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT
I MAKE YOU, HUH?

03:34.633 --> 03:36.367
- HUH? HOW ABOUT
I'M RIGHT OVER HERE?

03:36.367 --> 03:39.067
[overlapping shouting]

03:39.067 --> 03:40.233
- STOP IT!

03:40.233 --> 03:43.333
BE NICE BOYS.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.100
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WE ALL NEED A BREAK.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.700
LET'S HAVE A SNACK,

03:46.700 --> 03:50.033
AND MAYBE IF PUMPERNICKEL
HEARS US ENJOYING OUR FOOD,

03:50.033 --> 03:53.133
HE'LL JOIN US.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.500
- HE CAN HAVE SOME OF YOURS.
HE'S NOT GETTING ANY OF MINE.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.467
- DAD.
- WHAT?

04:03.467 --> 04:05.600
- I'M TRYING TO MOVE IT.
COULD YOU GET UP?

04:05.600 --> 04:09.867
- GIVE ME A RIDE.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.800
- AAH!

04:11.800 --> 04:15.100
- WHAT IS IT, MA? WHAT?

04:17.700 --> 04:21.100
- OH, BOY. THERE HE IS.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.233
- WHERE?

04:22.233 --> 04:23.467
- RIGHT THERE.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.300
- WHAT?
ALL I SEE IS FUDGE POPS.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.533
- LOOK AT THE HAIRY ONE
ON THE LEFT.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.600
- WHAT?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.167
HOLY CRAP.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.567
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:51.567 --> 04:53.233
- WHAT DID I DO?

04:53.233 --> 04:54.500
WHAT, YOU THINK I PUT HIM
IN THERE?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW HE GOT IN THERE.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.267
- OH, HE CLIMBED INTO
AN AIRTIGHT FREEZER BY HIMSELF?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.567
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.833
I-I CLEANED OUT
THE HAMSTER CAGE,

05:04.833 --> 05:06.400
AND I MUST NOT HAVE SNAPPED

05:06.400 --> 05:07.600
THE CAGE BACK TOGETHER
TIGHT ENOUGH.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.100
AND WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.667
THEN I WENT
GROCERY SHOPPING.

05:10.667 --> 05:14.200
- DID YOU HAVE THE GROCERIES
ON THE TABLE?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.900
- HE MUST HAVE CLIMBED
INTO THE BAG

05:15.900 --> 05:18.000
THAT HAD THE FUDGE POPS.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.367
LOOK--LOOK AT HIS WHISKERS.
THEY'RE ALL FUDGE-Y.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.167
- HIS LAST MEAL.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.367
- POOR PUMPERNICKEL.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.800
- ALLY IS GOING TO HATE ME.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
- HEY, GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.367
- WILL YOU GET OUT OF HERE?

05:36.367 --> 05:37.867
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.733
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
HE MAY NOT BE DEAD.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.367
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

05:41.367 --> 05:44.167
YOU COULD CRACK A WALNUT
WITH THAT THING.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.367
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.200
HE MAY BE CRYOGENICALLY
PRESERVED

05:47.200 --> 05:50.733
IN A STATE
OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

05:50.733 --> 05:53.000
- HE'S DEAD! ALL RIGHT?
I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE NOW.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.633
- OKAY, LOOK,
NOT NECESSARILY, RAY.

05:54.633 --> 05:56.267
WE MAY BE ABLE
TO RESUSCITATE HIM.

05:56.267 --> 06:01.333
- HEY, LET'S TOSS HIM
IN THE MICROWAVE.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.000
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S IT.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.467
I'M TAKING OVER THIS OPERATION.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.333
MA, GET ME SOME TOWELS.
DAD, I NEED SOME ICE.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.767
RAYMOND, A COOLER.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.500
WE'RE EVACUATING PUMPERNICKEL
TO THE VET.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.033
LET'S GO.
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

06:14.033 --> 06:18.000
- ROBERT, THE VET IS NOT GOING
TO REVIVE A HAMSTER, OKAY?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.433
THESE ARE DISPOSABLE PETS.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.333
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR
DAUGHTER'S FEELINGS, RAY, HUH?

06:22.333 --> 06:23.733
ARE THOSE DISPOSABLE?

06:23.733 --> 06:26.367
- ALL RIGHT.
- NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT!

06:26.367 --> 06:27.867
I HAPPEN TO CARE
ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL

06:27.867 --> 06:30.367
WHOSE HEART IS GOING TO BREAK
IF SHE FINDS OUT

06:30.367 --> 06:32.167
THAT HER DADDY DIDN'T DO
EVERYTHING HE COULD

06:32.167 --> 06:35.100
TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF HER PRECIOUS HAMSTER.

06:35.100 --> 06:39.033
NOW, DAMN IT, RAYMOND,
GET ME THAT COOLER!

06:41.133 --> 06:43.767
- HEY, RAY, YOU FORGOT
TO FILL THE ICE TRAYS.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.700
- WELL, THEN WE'LL JUST
PACK HIM WITH FUDGE POPS.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.800
- WHAT ABOUT THIS BOX
OF FISH STICKS?

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
- OH, THROW THEM IN TOO.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.100
WHEN DEBRA COMES HOME,

06:50.100 --> 06:54.467
I'LL SHOW HER
HOW TO COOK A REAL FISH.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.167
DEBRA.

07:12.167 --> 07:15.267
FRANK, GET UP.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.800
- HUH?
- COME ON.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.600
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.
YOU HAVEN'T DONE A THING.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.700
- HEY, LEAVE ME ALONE.
I'M TAKING A BREAK.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.367
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

07:28.367 --> 07:30.300
- I NOT ONLY STRAIGHTENED OUT
THE KITCHEN,

07:30.300 --> 07:31.933
I SCRUBBED THE COUNTERTOPS

07:31.933 --> 07:33.600
AND I CLEANED OUT
THE FREEZER.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.067
- AND YOU CELEBRATE
WITH A BOTTLE OF HOOCH?

07:39.067 --> 07:40.167
- HEY, WE'RE HOME.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.767
- HI, GRANDMA.
HI, GRANDPA.

07:41.767 --> 07:42.967
- HEY, SWEETHEART.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.567
- FRANK?

07:44.567 --> 07:47.267
- HI, SWEETHEART.
OH, THIS ISN'T MINE.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.233
THIS IS MOMMY'S.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.400
- MARIE, WHERE'S RAY?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.000
- OH, RAYMOND HAD TO RUSH OUT,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.633
BUT HE SHOULD BE
BACK SOON.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.833
- WHY DOES MY LIVING ROOM
LOOK LIKE A FRAT HOUSE?

07:57.833 --> 08:02.533
- I, UH, DIDN'T NOTICE
ANY DIFFERENCE, REALLY.

08:02.533 --> 08:03.700
- HI, DADDY.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.933
- OH, HEY.
HEY, EVERYBODY, YOU'RE HOME.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.167
HI. HEY.

08:08.167 --> 08:09.267
HI.
HOW WAS YOUR VISIT?

08:09.267 --> 08:11.100
OH, BOY, I MISSED YOU.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.567
HOW'S YOUR FATHER?
HOW'S HIS THING?

08:12.567 --> 08:14.133
HE'S GOT A KNEE--
WHAT DID HE HAVE, A KNEE?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.467
OH, HE GOT A NEW CAR--
HE GOT A NEW CAR.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.067
- RAY. RAY.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.533
W-WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

08:23.533 --> 08:26.967
- OH, NOTHING. UH-UH.
WHY?

08:26.967 --> 08:28.400
- WHAT'S THAT?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.567
- OH.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.967
OH, WE, UH--
WE GAVE PUMPERNICKEL A RIDE

08:31.967 --> 08:33.500
IN ROBERT'S POLICE CAR.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.900
YEAH, YEAH.
HE LIKED IT TOO.

08:36.900 --> 08:41.200
RODE THE WHOLE WAY WITH HIS,
UH, HEAD OUT THE WINDOW.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.433
- THIS ISN'T PUMPERNICKEL.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.700
DADDY, WHERE'S PUMPERNICKEL?

08:52.767 --> 08:56.433
- UM...

08:59.100 --> 09:01.800
UM...

09:01.800 --> 09:05.633
- PUMPERNICKEL SLEEPS
WITH THE FISH STICKS.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.433
YOU KNOW, ALLY,
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

09:21.433 --> 09:25.133
THAT FREEZING IS
A VIRTUALLY PAINLESS WAY TO GO.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.700
- UNLIKE MARRIAGE
WHERE THE PAIN IS--

09:30.700 --> 09:34.100
- FRANK.

09:37.433 --> 09:38.733
- CAN I SEE PUMPERNICKEL?

09:38.733 --> 09:40.133
- NO, NO, ALLY.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.100
- YEAH, SURE, HONEY,
YOU CAN GO SEE HIM.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.200
- WHAT?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.067
- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CLOSURE.

09:45.067 --> 09:47.867
- CLOSURE.

09:47.867 --> 09:52.167
READING BOOKS AGAIN?

09:52.167 --> 09:55.267
- WHY IS HE COVERED
IN CHOCOLATE?

09:58.533 --> 10:01.167
- SOME OF THE FUDGE POPS
MUST HAVE MELTED.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.500
- FUDGE POPS?
- GIVE ME, GIVE ME!

10:02.500 --> 10:03.933
- NO, NO, NO!
GET OUT OF THERE!

10:03.933 --> 10:05.267
- NO, GUYS. STOP THAT.
- DON'T TOUCH THOSE.

10:05.267 --> 10:06.500
NO, THAT'S NOT FUDGE IN THERE.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.900
- THERE'S COOKIES
IN THE KITCHEN.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.733
GO ON, HONEY. GO, GO, GO.
- GO GET A COOKIE.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.167
- COME HERE, SWEETHEART.

10:11.167 --> 10:13.600
YOU KNOW, THE IMPORTANT THING
TO KNOW, ALLY,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.733
IS THAT PUMPERNICKEL
IS IN HEAVEN.

10:16.733 --> 10:17.733
- NOT REALLY.

10:17.733 --> 10:20.100
- FRANK.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.033
- NOT REAL HEAVEN,
NOT PEOPLE HEAVEN.

10:22.033 --> 10:23.767
- THERE'S ONLY ONE HEAVEN.

10:23.767 --> 10:25.167
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

10:25.167 --> 10:27.033
THERE'S A WHOLE SEPARATE HEAVEN
FOR ANIMALS.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.733
- JUST WHERE
DID YOU LEARN THAT?

10:28.733 --> 10:30.833
- IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.267
- LIKE YOU READ THE BIBLE.

10:32.267 --> 10:35.400
- I'VE READ PLENTY
OF DAMN BIBLES.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.467
- DO ALL ANIMALS GO TO HEAVEN
OR JUST PETS?

10:45.467 --> 10:47.200
- ALL ANIMALS
GO TO PEOPLE HEAVEN

10:47.200 --> 10:48.233
WITH US, DEAR.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.833
- PEOPLE HEAVEN IS FOR PEOPLE.

10:49.833 --> 10:53.333
YOUR GRANDMA'S
BEEN HITTING THE SAUCE.

10:56.067 --> 10:58.100
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.600
THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.500
- DO SOME ANIMALS
GO TO HELL?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.067
- WE DON'T USE
THOSE WORDS, ALLY.

11:05.067 --> 11:09.033
- BAD ANIMALS GO TO HELL, KID.

11:09.033 --> 11:11.767
BELIEVE YOU ME, I KNOW.

11:11.767 --> 11:13.500
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

11:13.500 --> 11:16.567
THERE WAS THIS MEAN OLD
GERMAN SHEPHERD NAMED ILSA.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.933
I WAS WALKING
TO SCHOOL ONE DAY,

11:18.933 --> 11:21.733
AND I MUST HAVE CROSSED
TOO CLOSE TO HER TERRITORY.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.233
IN THOSE DAYS,

11:23.233 --> 11:27.300
THE GERMANS WERE VERY SENSITIVE
ABOUT THEIR TERRITORY.

11:32.633 --> 11:35.400
WELL, THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
FOR FRAULEIN ILSA,

11:35.400 --> 11:37.333
THE NAZI SHE-WOLF,
TO JUMP OUT

11:37.333 --> 11:41.667
AND TAKE A HUNK
OUT OF MY ALL-AMERICAN HIDE.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.567
I STILL HAVE THE SCAR.

11:44.567 --> 11:46.033
YOU WANT TO SEE IT?
I'LL SHOW YOU.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.400
- FRANK!
- NO!

11:47.400 --> 11:49.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SIT DOWN.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.567
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.200
THE POINT IS,

11:54.200 --> 11:55.767
FRAULEIN ILSA IS PROBABLY
IN HELL RIGHT NOW

11:55.767 --> 11:59.600
DRAGGING HER NAZI BUTT
ACROSS THE DEVIL'S CARPET.

12:07.533 --> 12:12.000
- THANK YOU
FOR THAT HEARTWARMING STORY.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.300
LOOK, ALLY,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.533
I'M VERY SORRY
THAT THIS HAPPENED,

12:15.533 --> 12:16.833
BUT...

12:16.833 --> 12:20.233
NOW IT'S TIME TO MEET
YOUR BRAND-NEW HAMSTER.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.533
- NO, THANKS.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.067
- OH, COME ON.
LOOK, LOOK.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.367
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE OLD PUMPERNICKEL,

12:24.367 --> 12:26.767
AND THE GUY AT THE STORE

12:26.767 --> 12:29.633
TOLD ME THAT
IN A COUPLE YEARS HE MIGHT...

12:29.633 --> 12:31.533
FLY.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.067
- RAY.

12:34.067 --> 12:37.533
RAY, DON'T TELL HER THAT.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.900
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
SO HE WON'T.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.300
H-HE'S NOT GOING TO FLY,

12:41.300 --> 12:45.067
BUT HE DID SAY THAT--
THAT HE'S MAGICAL.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.900
- RAY.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.533
- HIS PERSONALITY!

12:51.533 --> 12:52.733
- NO, DAD.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.467
- OH, COME ON, ALLY,
JUST TAKE A LOOK.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.300
HE'S A CUTE
LITTLE REPLACEMENT.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.000
- I DON'T WANT
A REPLACEMENT, DADDY!

13:01.700 --> 13:03.100
[door closes]

13:03.100 --> 13:05.033
- I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE NEEDS--

13:05.033 --> 13:08.300
A REPLACEMENT DADDY.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.400
- COULD YOU GO HOME, PLEASE?

13:18.400 --> 13:22.200
AND TAKE THESE TWO THEOLOGIANS
WITH YOU.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.200
- LOOK-IT...

13:29.200 --> 13:30.433
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, SWEETIE.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.533
WHEN A CHILD'S PET DIES,

13:32.533 --> 13:36.000
SHE HAS TO GO THROUGH
A GRIEVING PROCESS

13:36.000 --> 13:37.633
BEFORE SHE CAN TAKE ON
A NEW PET.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.333
- ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN READ.
WE GET IT.

13:43.167 --> 13:46.600
ISN'T IT A LITTLE MORBID TO MAKE
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.333
- NO, IT'S NOT MORBID.
IT'S REALITY.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.467
- OH, COME ON.
IT'S A HAMSTER.

13:50.467 --> 13:52.933
JUST--JUST LEAVE IT ALONE,
AND SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WOULD
BE HEALTHY FOR ALL THE KIDS?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.333
IF WE HAVE SORT OF
A FORMAL GOOD-BYE CEREMONY

13:57.333 --> 13:58.500
FOR PUMPERNICKEL.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.767
- GOOD IDEA, DEB.
- YEAH.

13:59.767 --> 14:01.533
RAY CAN DIG A HOLE
IN THE BACK YARD.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.967
- I'M NOT DIGGING A HOLE.
- YOU'RE DIGGING A HOLE.

14:03.967 --> 14:05.500
AND I WILL GET A SHOEBOX.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.767
- OKAY, I'LL PUT OUT
THE COLD CUTS.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.400
- I'LL GET SOME BEER.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.500
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT ON A FUNERAL.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.367
- [grunting]

14:25.867 --> 14:28.733
- HEY.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.800
HOW'S IT GOING?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.267
- I'M DIGGING THROUGH SOLID ROCK
IN A RAINSTORM.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.000
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING?

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
- WHAT, ARE YOU MADE OF SUGAR?
IT'S BARELY DRIZZLING.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.900
- OW!

14:44.900 --> 14:48.967
- CAREFUL, HONEY.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.300
- WHY DON'T YOU DIG THIS HOLE?

14:50.300 --> 14:51.867
THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT ANYWAY, YOU KNOW?

14:51.867 --> 14:53.167
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT BROKEN PIECE

14:53.167 --> 14:54.500
ON THE HAMSTER CAGE.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.700
- HEY, HEY, IF YOU WERE
A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED,

14:56.700 --> 14:58.800
YOU'D PICK UP
ON THESE DETAILS.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.133
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.600
- MAYBE I CAN MAKE THIS HOLE
A LITTLE BIGGER.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.033
[grunts]

15:12.600 --> 15:15.967
OH, COME ON, DAD.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.767
AGAIN WITH THE METAL DETECTOR?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:18.767 --> 15:23.867
- YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY
IS COMING UP.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.300
- YEAH, WELL,

15:25.300 --> 15:26.933
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
BUT DIRT AND ROCKS.

15:26.933 --> 15:31.533
- THAT'S BETTER THAN
WHAT HE GOT ME LAST YEAR.

15:31.533 --> 15:34.033
- ALL RIGHT, ALLY, WHY DON'T
YOU--WE'LL PUT THE BOX IN,

15:34.033 --> 15:35.767
AND THEN I'LL PUT THE DIRT
ON IT.

15:35.767 --> 15:36.833
- WAIT.

15:36.833 --> 15:37.967
I WANT EVERYBODY
TO SAY SOMETHING

15:37.967 --> 15:39.400
ABOUT PUMPERNICKEL FIRST.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.767
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.533
AND THEN WE'LL ALL TAKE
A HANDFUL OF DIRT

15:42.533 --> 15:43.333
AND TOSS IT IN.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.467
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:44.467 --> 15:45.467
- THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.433
- IT'S RAINING, HONEY.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.333
- LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD DO
THIS ALLY'S WAY.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.567
YOU WANT TO GET UNDER
MY UMBRELLA?

15:50.567 --> 15:51.933
- I'M WONDERFUL
RIGHT WHERE I AM,

15:51.933 --> 15:55.133
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.767
- DADDY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO START?

15:57.767 --> 15:59.833
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.900
WHY DON'T WE LET GRANDPA START?
GO AHEAD.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.133
- GRANDPA?

16:04.133 --> 16:07.000
- UH, DAD, COULD YOU POWER DOWN
FOR A SECOND?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.633
- HUH?
OH, OH, OH, OH.

16:10.633 --> 16:11.767
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

16:11.767 --> 16:15.633
UH, PUMPERNICKEL...

16:15.633 --> 16:20.033
LIKED THE HAMSTER,
LOVE THE BREAD.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.033
NEXT!

16:22.033 --> 16:23.567
- GRANDMA?

16:23.567 --> 16:25.800
- OKAY, DEAR.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.133
EVEN THOUGH PUMPERNICKEL
HAS GONE FROM THIS EARTH,

16:29.133 --> 16:30.833
I KNOW HE'LL ALWAYS BE

16:30.833 --> 16:35.500
LOOKING DOWN AT US
FROM HEAVEN--PEOPLE HEAVEN.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.367
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD,
UNCLE ROBERT.

16:37.367 --> 16:41.167
- [clears throat loudly]

16:42.633 --> 16:46.233
DEATH...

16:49.800 --> 16:53.367
THE FINAL GOOD-BYE...

16:53.367 --> 16:56.633
THE ULTIMATE TOODLE-OO.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.300
OR MAYBE--
MAYBE DEATH IS NOT THE END.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.400
MAYBE IT'S A BEGINNING.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.367
PERHAPS IT'S
THE ULTIMATE HOWDY-DO.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.000
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:08.000 --> 17:12.033
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, RAY--
TOO DEEP FOR YOU?

17:12.033 --> 17:13.300
- OH, GOD.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.233
- GO AHEAD, ROBERT.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.800
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION

17:17.800 --> 17:19.233
THAT WHEN I DIE,

17:19.233 --> 17:21.833
I WOULD LIKE TO DIE
LIKE PUMPERNICKEL--

17:21.833 --> 17:24.333
QUIETLY, PAINLESSLY,

17:24.333 --> 17:25.567
CHOCOLATE FUDGE POP

17:25.567 --> 17:29.300
STUCK TO THE CORNER
OF MY MOUTH...

17:29.300 --> 17:34.000
FOR THAT, MY FRIENDS,
MUST BE A HAPPY DEATH.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.567
[dirt thuds]

17:37.567 --> 17:39.267
ALOHA...

17:39.267 --> 17:42.700
WHICH MEANS GOOD-BYE
AND HELLO.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.833
- ALL RIGHT.

17:43.833 --> 17:47.133
- SAME WITH SHALOM.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.867
- SHUT UP.
ONE MEANING.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.700
- ALL RIGHT, RAY.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.833
- YOUR TURN, MOMMY.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.233
- OKAY, WELL,

17:58.233 --> 18:00.633
I'VE ALWAYS FELT
VERY CLOSE TO PUMPERNICKEL,

18:00.633 --> 18:03.833
ESPECIALLY SINCE I DID
A LOT OF THE FEEDING

18:03.833 --> 18:05.100
AND CLEANING

18:05.100 --> 18:09.933
AND, YOU KNOW,
MOST OF THE WORK.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.500
SO PUMPERNICKEL'S PASSING

18:11.500 --> 18:14.533
IS GOING TO LEAVE
A BIG HOLE IN MY LIFE.

18:14.533 --> 18:19.267
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT I'LL DO
WITH THE TIME.

18:19.267 --> 18:23.067
SO LONG, PUMPERNICKEL.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.900
- MICHAEL?

18:26.900 --> 18:29.500
- ALLY, WHY DON'T WE DO
THE TWINS AS A SET, OKAY?

18:29.500 --> 18:30.900
'CAUSE IT'S RAINING.
- RAY, RAY.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
COME UNDER MY UMBRELLA. JUST--

18:33.200 --> 18:37.900
- HEY, NO TALKING.
HAMSTER FUNERAL.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.533
- I'LL MISS YOU, PUMPERNICKEL.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.033
- GEOFFREY.

18:45.033 --> 18:48.600
- I'LL MISS YOU TOO,
PUMPERNICKEL.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.267
- NOW MY TURN.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.100
I'LL MISS YOU TOO,
PUMPERNICKEL.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.500
YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND,
AND YOU STILL ARE.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.300
DON'T WORRY,
PUMPERNICKEL.

19:03.300 --> 19:07.600
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WITH ME,
'CAUSE I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

19:09.833 --> 19:14.600
[dirt thuds]

19:16.667 --> 19:19.267
YOUR TURN, DADDY.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.800
- UH...

19:25.800 --> 19:29.433
UM...

19:29.433 --> 19:34.567
I DIDN'T, UH,
HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH...

19:34.567 --> 19:36.800
I DIDN'T KNOW PUMPERNICKEL
VERY WELL.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.400
UH, THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER

19:39.400 --> 19:42.167
IS WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM BACK
FROM THE PET STORE

19:42.167 --> 19:45.033
AND ALLY WANTED ME
TO HOLD HIM,

19:45.033 --> 19:46.567
SO I REACHED OUT
TO GRAB HIM,

19:46.567 --> 19:51.300
AND HE BIT ME ON THE FINGER,
AND IT HURT.

19:51.300 --> 19:55.100
SO DADDY SAID A BAD WORD.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.200
BUT ALLY PICKED UP, UH...

20:03.200 --> 20:05.933
PUMPERNICKEL,
AND--AND SHE SHOWED ME--

20:05.933 --> 20:08.733
SHOWED ME HOW TO HOLD HIM...

20:08.733 --> 20:10.500
LIKE THIS...

20:10.500 --> 20:13.467
RIGHT?

20:17.667 --> 20:22.500
I NEVER NOTICED UNTIL JUST NOW
HOW GROWN UP YOU ARE.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.200
THE WAY YOU WERE
WITH YOUR FRIEND

20:25.200 --> 20:27.833
AND WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW--

20:27.833 --> 20:31.700
YOU REALLY...

20:31.700 --> 20:34.800
YOU REALLY SEEM GROWN UP.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.467
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.767
- DAMN HAMSTER.

20:55.800 --> 21:00.100
- DADDY...

21:00.100 --> 21:04.633
CAN WE GET
A RABBIT TOMORROW?

21:04.633 --> 21:06.867
- YEAH, GUYS,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

21:06.867 --> 21:08.700
- COOL. A RABBIT!

21:08.700 --> 21:10.233
- YEAH! WHOO!

21:10.233 --> 21:13.633
- YEAH, COOL.
- YEAH.

21:13.633 --> 21:16.233
[door closes]

21:16.233 --> 21:20.533
- RABBIT--
THAT'S A BIGGER HOLE.

21:28.733 --> 21:31.433
[door opens]

21:34.100 --> 21:36.867
- YOU ALL LAUGHED AT ME, HUH?

21:36.867 --> 21:39.600
BIG WASTE OF TIME, HUH?

21:39.600 --> 21:42.400
[coins jingling]

21:42.400 --> 21:43.700
HUH?

21:43.700 --> 21:45.733
[chuckles]

21:45.733 --> 21:49.000
I THINK I'LL BUY MYSELF
A YOO-HOO.

21:52.933 --> 21:55.433
- THERE GOES
MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
