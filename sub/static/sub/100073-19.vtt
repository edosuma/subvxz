WEBVTT

00:06.858 --> 00:09.583
Swear to God, now
he has this woman tied up,

00:09.585 --> 00:11.251
his own aunt.

00:11.253 --> 00:13.153
He has a shotgun rigged
with duct tape and a string

00:13.155 --> 00:14.621
so he can shoot her from the fireplace.

00:14.623 --> 00:17.658
Yeah, while Chen's across town
going toe-to-toe with the 5-4.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.459
Yeah, thirty gang members
against me and my T.O.

00:19.461 --> 00:20.922
Oh, my God, that's hardcore.

00:20.924 --> 00:21.956
How the hell'd you get out of that?

00:21.958 --> 00:25.018
No joke, my T.O. goes,
"When you're in the LAPD"...

00:25.020 --> 00:26.486
"You're never alone".

00:26.488 --> 00:27.660
And right on cue,

00:27.662 --> 00:29.489
an airship arrives with a SWAT team.

00:29.491 --> 00:30.757
Damn, there's me thinking

00:30.759 --> 00:32.892
discharging my weapon
this year was a big deal.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.527
Aw, don't beat yourself up, Chris.

00:34.529 --> 00:35.895
I'm sure someday you'll catch up.

00:37.622 --> 00:38.678
Oh, it's like that?

00:38.680 --> 00:40.066
Oh, yeah. It's like that.

00:40.068 --> 00:42.135
Come on, you guys. We're
not in the Academy anymore.

00:42.137 --> 00:44.191
We don't have to be
competitive about everything.

00:44.193 --> 00:46.608
Well, it's not a competition
when I always win.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.752
Ooh, that's a deep cut!
But he does have a point.

00:48.754 --> 00:49.776
- That's it, West.
- Hmm?

00:49.778 --> 00:51.211
You and me, right now...

00:51.213 --> 00:52.979
We're gonna settle this
thing once and for all.

00:52.981 --> 00:54.147
Mm.

00:56.952 --> 00:58.218
Drink up. Drink up.

00:59.354 --> 01:02.082
I can't believe they still
can't let go of their rivalry.

01:02.084 --> 01:04.608
Can't you? They were first
and second at the Academy.

01:04.610 --> 01:05.959
Their dads were first and second.

01:05.961 --> 01:07.760
- Oh! Sorry! Sorry!
- Oh, ho, ho!

01:07.762 --> 01:08.929
- You okay?
- Yep.

01:09.931 --> 01:10.997
Nope.

01:10.999 --> 01:13.666
I was just gonna get some
air. How about you join me?

01:15.137 --> 01:16.970
- Sorry.
- No, no, no. Don't.

01:20.242 --> 01:22.575
So, I'm actually fine.

01:22.577 --> 01:24.978
Just... a little worried about Chris.

01:24.980 --> 01:27.480
I mean, you always gave the
best advice at the Academy.

01:27.482 --> 01:29.333
Thank you. Uh, what's going on?

01:29.335 --> 01:31.710
At first, I thought it was
just a rocky transition.

01:31.712 --> 01:34.002
You know, going from
being top of the class

01:34.004 --> 01:35.160
to being just another Boot.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.258
But... he never really evened out.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.693
Did you know he barely
passed our six-month exam?

01:40.695 --> 01:42.629
- Can you believe that?
- Actually, I can.

01:42.631 --> 01:44.597
If he came in expecting it to be easy,

01:44.599 --> 01:45.832
I mean, it is not.

01:45.834 --> 01:48.301
I'm worried. What if he's
really not ready?

01:48.303 --> 01:49.602
Should I say something?

01:49.604 --> 01:51.605
I can't answer that for you.

01:52.936 --> 01:56.338
I can tell you that this year has
been tough for all of us.

01:56.340 --> 01:58.673
I mean, no vacation, no sick days,

01:58.675 --> 02:00.308
constantly under a microscope.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.810
We've all stumbled.

02:01.812 --> 02:03.645
Yeah.

02:03.647 --> 02:05.814
If I were you, I would just...

02:05.816 --> 02:07.682
tell Chris you're there for him.

02:07.684 --> 02:10.018
And if he can bear down
for one more month,

02:10.020 --> 02:11.486
then he can take some time off

02:11.488 --> 02:13.655
and just clear his head,
you know, reset.

02:13.657 --> 02:16.825
I've been trying to convince
him to go on the road with me,

02:16.827 --> 02:19.961
take an RV and camp, hike,

02:19.963 --> 02:22.130
just disconnect from all the noise

02:22.132 --> 02:23.498
before we come back as P2s.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.700
See, that would be perfect.

02:25.669 --> 02:27.435
Yeah.

02:27.437 --> 02:28.837
Thanks.

02:28.839 --> 02:31.039
I knew I'd feel better talking to you.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.607
50 bucks.

02:32.609 --> 02:34.076
Nolan! I need your help.

02:34.912 --> 02:36.511
I'm sorry. How is this helping?

02:36.513 --> 02:38.980
- Jackson and I are tied.
- One more event will settle this.

02:38.982 --> 02:40.615
If you hit Nolan, you lose.

02:40.617 --> 02:41.850
Wait, what game is this?

02:41.852 --> 02:43.151
- Suicide darts.
- Suicide darts.

02:43.153 --> 02:44.519
Ow!

02:49.726 --> 02:52.060
I do not wanna go to work today.

02:52.062 --> 02:54.689
Mm, you can be a few minutes late.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.735
Yeah, and do push-ups
in between every call

03:00.737 --> 03:02.377
and jog behind the shop?

03:02.379 --> 03:03.535
No, thanks.

03:03.537 --> 03:04.706
Mm.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.215
- Oh, come on!
- Mnh-mnh!

03:06.217 --> 03:07.339
Bradford's chill.

03:07.341 --> 03:09.711
I mean, maybe if you're
playing pick-up with him,

03:09.713 --> 03:12.013
but not when he's your T.O.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.516
He once designed an IED

03:14.518 --> 03:16.818
to blow up baby powder in my face

03:16.820 --> 03:17.886
just to make a point.

03:17.888 --> 03:19.487
Is he allowed to do that?

03:19.489 --> 03:21.038
I just need to get through
the next thirty days,

03:21.040 --> 03:22.590
and then I will be free.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.926
No more mind games. No more Tim Tests.

03:24.928 --> 03:26.828
No more chewing me out in public.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.998
Okay, so you're saying thirty days,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.167
and then I can make you late?

03:32.169 --> 03:33.602
- Mm.
- Hm?

03:34.571 --> 03:36.171
Mm.

03:36.173 --> 03:37.906
Um... listen.

03:37.908 --> 03:40.208
If we bump into each other at work,

03:40.210 --> 03:43.578
can we please just play it cool?

03:43.580 --> 03:44.879
I'm not cool?

03:44.881 --> 03:46.514
No! You know what I mean!

03:46.516 --> 03:49.507
Like, on the... D.L.

03:49.509 --> 03:50.585
The D.L.?

03:50.587 --> 03:52.347
Yep, I said that. I'm sorry.

03:52.349 --> 03:54.789
Don't laugh!

03:54.791 --> 03:56.139
Don't you work with your roommate?

03:56.141 --> 03:58.526
Oh, Jackson's got my back.
He would never talk.

03:58.528 --> 04:02.097
Well, I can't promise I'll be
able to keep my eyes off of you,

04:02.099 --> 04:04.966
but otherwise, deal.

04:04.968 --> 04:06.491
- Thank you.
- Mm.

04:06.493 --> 04:07.949
Aah!

04:07.951 --> 04:09.604
But, wait, Grace might actually

04:09.606 --> 04:11.072
let her ex-husband come back home?

04:11.074 --> 04:12.640
For the sake of her son.

04:12.642 --> 04:14.542
Look, I-I get where she's coming from.

04:14.544 --> 04:16.444
I mean, I did something
similar with my ex.

04:16.446 --> 04:17.545
Staying together for the kid,

04:17.547 --> 04:19.781
even when you knew
the relationship was doomed.

04:19.783 --> 04:22.050
Did that actually make
things better for Henry?

04:22.052 --> 04:23.718
No. But what am I gonna do?

04:23.720 --> 04:25.415
Mansplain to her she's making a mistake?

04:25.417 --> 04:26.544
How well is that gonna go over?

04:26.546 --> 04:27.622
Yeah, not well.

04:27.624 --> 04:29.557
But if you leave her alone,

04:29.559 --> 04:30.968
you risk giving the ex an opening.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.058
Tough one.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.482
I'm looking for some sage advice here.

04:33.484 --> 04:36.153
If you haven't noticed, my
personal life's a dumpster fire.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.968
All I can say is...

04:39.970 --> 04:41.504
I'm rooting for you two.

04:42.304 --> 04:44.272
Good luck, buddy.

04:44.274 --> 04:45.740
You can do it.

04:45.742 --> 04:46.975
I'm telling you.

04:46.977 --> 04:50.678
Today is our rookies' one-year
mark in the F.T.O. program.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.981
Congratulations on not washing out.

04:55.052 --> 04:56.151
Yet.

04:56.153 --> 04:57.252
We'll see.

04:57.254 --> 04:58.409
There's still time.

04:58.411 --> 05:01.656
That also means today is the start

05:01.658 --> 05:02.991
of your Thirty Day Push.

05:03.756 --> 05:05.236
Why is that important, Officer Nolan?

05:06.163 --> 05:08.129
Because in one month,

05:08.131 --> 05:10.298
we will no longer be
probationary employees,

05:10.300 --> 05:14.602
but fully fledged patrol
officers of the LAPD?

05:14.604 --> 05:16.004
- No.
- Damn it.

05:16.006 --> 05:18.480
Because, as your T.O.s have pointed out,

05:18.482 --> 05:20.141
you are not there yet.

05:20.143 --> 05:22.544
The end of the race
is always the hardest.

05:22.546 --> 05:25.280
The Push is to remind
you not to celebrate

05:25.282 --> 05:26.848
until you cross the finish line.

05:26.850 --> 05:27.949
Understand?

05:27.951 --> 05:29.017
Yes, sir.

05:29.019 --> 05:30.118
Good.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.720
And... that's all I got.

05:32.722 --> 05:34.956
For the first time in history,

05:34.958 --> 05:36.824
the night shift did their jobs...

05:36.826 --> 05:39.961
left no open cases
that require follow-up.

05:39.963 --> 05:42.630
So, go on, find some crime.

05:42.632 --> 05:43.865
And be safe out there.

05:46.870 --> 05:49.304
It's weird we haven't had any calls yet.

05:49.306 --> 05:51.139
Crime doesn't run on a schedule, Boot.

05:54.044 --> 05:55.343
What are you so happy about?

05:55.345 --> 05:57.312
What? Nothing.

05:57.314 --> 05:58.646
Can't I smile?

05:58.648 --> 06:00.215
You've just been doing it a lot lately.

06:00.217 --> 06:02.560
I didn't realize happiness
was an impediment

06:02.562 --> 06:03.651
to being a good cop.

06:03.653 --> 06:04.819
I'm just surprised you haven't tried

06:04.821 --> 06:06.888
to talk my ear off about whatever it is.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.124
So, what? Did you rescue a kitten?

06:09.126 --> 06:10.158
Adopt a star?

06:10.160 --> 06:13.661
My personal life is
none of your business.

06:13.663 --> 06:15.563
Finally. There's hope for you yet.

06:16.723 --> 06:18.746
My mom is driving me crazy.

06:18.748 --> 06:20.335
She's teamed up with Wesley's mom,

06:20.337 --> 06:21.936
so every time I try to make a decision

06:21.938 --> 06:23.204
about the wedding, I'm outnumbered.

06:23.206 --> 06:25.073
You're the bride.
Shouldn't you get final say?

06:25.075 --> 06:26.741
I'm the only girl in either family,

06:26.743 --> 06:28.209
so they're living vicariously.

06:28.211 --> 06:29.911
And I don't have the
bandwidth to push back

06:29.913 --> 06:32.080
because I'm so focused
on making detective.

06:32.082 --> 06:33.881
If I don't make the next
round of promotions,

06:33.883 --> 06:36.784
I'll have to take the
detective's exam again.

06:36.786 --> 06:38.086
But while I'm distracted,

06:38.088 --> 06:39.921
those viejas are hijacking my wedding.

06:39.923 --> 06:41.789
Come on. I'm pretty
sure it's not that bad.

06:41.791 --> 06:45.316
They decided the color scheme
should be pink and peach.

06:45.318 --> 06:46.394
Oh, no.

06:46.396 --> 06:48.763
Do I look like a woman
who's ever worn peach?

06:48.765 --> 06:50.898
No. You're definitely an autumn.

06:55.705 --> 06:58.106
Is that... ?

06:58.108 --> 06:59.707
No.

06:59.709 --> 07:00.976
No.

07:02.879 --> 07:03.912
Wait a second.

07:05.248 --> 07:06.281
No. Forget it.

07:06.283 --> 07:08.383
Okay, so, how about you
make visual confirmation

07:08.385 --> 07:09.951
before you speak?

07:09.953 --> 07:11.153
Roger that.

07:12.656 --> 07:14.289
You a little nervous about court today?

07:14.291 --> 07:15.323
My lawyer says,

07:15.325 --> 07:17.825
with all of my positive
changes that I've made

07:17.827 --> 07:20.828
and my improved relationship
with Donovan, there's no reason

07:20.830 --> 07:22.730
the judge shouldn't
grant me shared custody.

07:22.732 --> 07:23.765
That's great!

07:23.767 --> 07:25.800
Yeah, except the judge
is a real hard-ass

07:25.802 --> 07:29.404
and has a reputation for being
unorthodox in his rulings.

07:29.406 --> 07:32.741
I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.

07:35.278 --> 07:38.279
Man! I don't know that I've
ever had a shift this quiet.

07:41.418 --> 07:44.575
Did you really just say
the "Q" word in my shop?

07:44.577 --> 07:45.820
What? Quie...

07:45.822 --> 07:47.755
Na-na-ah-ah-ah-ah! Stop!

07:47.757 --> 07:50.158
You do not, under any circumstance,

07:50.160 --> 07:52.760
ever use the "Q" word while on duty.

07:52.762 --> 07:54.829
That is like saying "Macbeth" in theater

07:54.831 --> 07:56.998
or talking about a
no-hitter in the dugout.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.434
O... kay. I had no idea
you were superstitious.

07:59.436 --> 08:01.526
That is not superstition. That's fact.

08:01.528 --> 08:03.071
Where are you going?

08:03.073 --> 08:05.006
I am going to get the
trauma plate for my vest,

08:05.008 --> 08:06.874
'cause I have a feeling
I'm gonna need it.

08:06.876 --> 08:09.811
You and your big mouth probably
just cost me custody of my kid.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.385
Wilshire units, information only.

08:17.387 --> 08:20.495
Hollywood division is in pursuit
after a shots fired call.

08:20.497 --> 08:22.786
Event 8-0-5 working on channel 4.

08:22.788 --> 08:24.025
Information only.

08:24.027 --> 08:25.393
Turn that on. I wanna hear.

08:26.529 --> 08:28.129
Uh, gr-gray Maserati, no plates.

08:28.131 --> 08:29.964
Suspect vehicle is picking up speed.

08:29.966 --> 08:32.866
Uh, we are southbound on
Normandie, 50 miles an hour.

08:32.869 --> 08:34.168
We got moderate traffic.

08:34.169 --> 08:35.870
Wait. That voice.

08:35.871 --> 08:36.971
That's Chris.

08:36.972 --> 08:37.972
Rios.

08:38.975 --> 08:40.475
We went to the Academy together.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.667
His dad worked Narcotics with
my old man back in the day.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.912
Well, at least Hollywood's
getting a little action today.

08:44.914 --> 08:47.215
O-O-O-Okay, wait.
I'm... J-Just stand by.

08:47.217 --> 08:48.349
Something's going down.

08:48.351 --> 08:49.817
Okay, he's left on Wilshire.

08:49.819 --> 08:51.686
E-Eastbound on Wilshire. Speed is 70.

08:51.688 --> 08:53.921
This is heavy traffic. He's...
He's blowing lights.

08:53.923 --> 08:55.890
- Sidewalk! He's on the sidewalk!
- He's too amped up.

08:55.892 --> 08:57.058
Copy, eastbound Wilshire,

08:57.060 --> 08:58.326
speed 70, blowing lights call.

08:58.328 --> 08:59.894
6-Mary-100, copy?

08:59.896 --> 09:01.396
Copy. Advise Mid-Wilshire.

09:01.398 --> 09:03.731
Want is 245 with a handgun.

09:03.733 --> 09:06.067
Control, 7-Adam-15,
attach us to the pursuit.

09:06.069 --> 09:08.403
Event 8-0-5 and switching to channel 4.

09:08.405 --> 09:10.405
"Quiet", he says.

09:10.407 --> 09:13.574
6-Adam-41, just T.C.'d,
Wilshire at Virgil.

09:13.576 --> 09:15.943
We are lead car. I-I'm
gonna need backup, guys.

09:15.945 --> 09:17.245
I need... I-I need help!

09:17.247 --> 09:18.946
Copy, 6-Mary-47 help call.

09:18.948 --> 09:20.948
Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire
units responding.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.551
Control, 7-Adam-19, attach. Code 3.

09:26.022 --> 09:28.690
Copy, 6-Mary-47 eastbound on Wilshire,

09:28.692 --> 09:29.790
approaching MacArthur Park.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.032
That's right around the corner.

09:31.895 --> 09:34.228
Control, 7-Adam-07,
we're two blocks from there.

09:34.230 --> 09:35.897
Suspect vehicle has crashed!

09:43.006 --> 09:44.459
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- Hands! Hands!

09:44.461 --> 09:46.574
Show me your hands! Hands on the window!

09:46.576 --> 09:48.109
- Chris, get back!
- Hands! Hands!

09:48.111 --> 09:49.711
- Show me your hands!
- No! No!

09:50.780 --> 09:52.280
No! Chris!

09:52.282 --> 09:53.881
Son of a bitch!

09:53.883 --> 09:55.184
Rios!

10:05.962 --> 10:08.129
Control, 7-15, we have the Maserati,

10:08.131 --> 10:09.263
northbound Park View.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.233
In pursuit. Speed's 60. Occupied once.

10:13.010 --> 10:14.699
7-Adam-07, shots fired.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.437
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

10:16.439 --> 10:18.304
Requesting R.A. for a 25-year-old male,

10:18.306 --> 10:19.373
gunshot wound to the chest.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.842
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Conscious and breathing.

10:20.844 --> 10:22.244
Park View at 7th.

10:24.726 --> 10:27.521
All units, be advised,
7-Adam-15 in pursuit

10:27.523 --> 10:29.489
of gray Maserati heading
south on Alvarado.

10:29.491 --> 10:31.781
- Do you see him?
- Negative. I lost him at the last intersection.

10:31.783 --> 10:32.826
Damn it.

10:32.828 --> 10:33.950
Attention, all units.

10:33.952 --> 10:36.212
Air-12 spotted a gray Maserati
matching suspect's vehicle

10:36.214 --> 10:38.514
entering covered parking
structure at 6th and Grand.

10:38.516 --> 10:40.316
7-Adam-15 responding. Code 3.

10:45.505 --> 10:46.738
Just keep breathing, buddy, alright?

10:46.740 --> 10:48.043
- Martinez.
- Alright. Huh?

10:48.045 --> 10:50.251
Sarge is gonna want to talk
to you. You're a witness.

10:50.253 --> 10:51.876
- I'm not leaving this kid alone.
- I'll go.

10:51.878 --> 10:53.712
One, two, three! Lift!

11:05.997 --> 11:08.097
This shouldn't have happened.

11:08.099 --> 11:09.999
I made a felony stop.

11:10.001 --> 11:12.535
Rios just charged.

11:12.537 --> 11:15.538
I mean, he's made mistakes
before, but never like this.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.006
He knows...

11:17.008 --> 11:19.210
stop at a safe distance,
wait for backup,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.595
- approach with caution, but...
- It hap... It happens.

11:21.597 --> 11:22.990
Rookies aren't used to the adrenaline.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.812
They get amped up. It's
lights and sirens syndrome.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.949
I told him on day one. I told him.

11:26.951 --> 11:29.986
It's the hardest part
about being a T.O. Okay?

11:29.988 --> 11:33.456
We drill it into their head,
but at the end of the day,

11:33.458 --> 11:34.758
they make their own calls.

11:36.061 --> 11:37.960
Still feels like my fault.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.606
No. Come on.

11:39.608 --> 11:41.298
You hurt?

11:41.300 --> 11:43.615
Nah, I just... just tweaked
it pulling him out of danger.

11:43.617 --> 11:45.721
- I'm alright.
- 7-Adam-19,

11:45.723 --> 11:47.704
send an additional R.A. to my location.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.572
You're gonna be okay.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.841
Look at me. Look at me. Alright?

11:51.843 --> 11:53.810
Remember the obstacle
course at the Academy?

11:53.812 --> 11:56.012
First time through,
you had a torn hamstring

11:56.014 --> 11:57.470
and still beat me.

11:57.472 --> 11:59.883
Yeah, and I practiced
every single day after that,

11:59.885 --> 12:01.107
knowing that you'd be coming for me.

12:01.109 --> 12:03.244
I was only number one because
you were there pushing me.

12:03.246 --> 12:05.722
And now I'm gonna be here pushing you,

12:05.724 --> 12:07.857
getting you back to your feet.

12:07.859 --> 12:08.891
Alright?

12:08.893 --> 12:10.827
Okay, and I expect your
"A" game, man, alright?

12:10.829 --> 12:12.695
None of that "I got shot" B.S.
You hear me?

12:13.898 --> 12:15.031
Chris, you hear me, man?

12:17.035 --> 12:19.091
He's losing too much blood!

12:19.093 --> 12:20.570
- How much further?!
- Three minutes out.

12:20.572 --> 12:22.872
Chris. Come on, Chris.
Stay with me, man! Come on!

12:22.874 --> 12:23.940
Chris!

12:27.946 --> 12:29.045
There.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.525
Nolan. Door.

12:42.627 --> 12:43.760
Got a gun.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.762
You need to secure it while
I go after the suspect.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.829
I'll go with you.

12:46.831 --> 12:48.765
No, that gun is a crucial
piece of evidence,

12:48.767 --> 12:51.093
and TID has their hands full
processing the shooting scene,

12:51.095 --> 12:53.264
so I am designating you the finder.

12:53.266 --> 12:54.771
Photograph everything.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.039
Make sure you get that gun
exactly how it was found.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.431
Glove up, collect it, and
store it in our shop's lock box.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.643
- You got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.612
Control, 7-Adam-15.

13:02.614 --> 13:03.869
Suspect vehicle located

13:03.871 --> 13:06.285
in a parking structure on 6th and Grand.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.474
Gun on scene. My T.O.
is in pursuit of suspect

13:08.476 --> 13:11.120
through a maintenance door
on the northeast corner.

13:11.122 --> 13:12.955
Need backup. Code 3.

13:47.192 --> 13:49.492
Control, 7-Adam-15.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.099
Shut down all code 3 units.

13:51.101 --> 13:52.528
Suspect is G.O.A.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.830
Damn it.

13:55.767 --> 13:56.943
25-year-old male,

13:56.945 --> 13:58.667
single gunshot wound to the chest.

13:58.669 --> 14:01.464
Possible lung collapse. He's
down two liters of blood.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.522
Aren't you taking him to surgery?

14:02.524 --> 14:04.483
If I don't stop the bleeding,
he won't make it to the OR.

14:04.485 --> 14:06.186
Three, two, one.

14:06.978 --> 14:08.978
Get a gurney. Clear Trauma 1.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.546
Get him on the monitor.

14:11.983 --> 14:14.617
Jackson, I hear... I heard
what happened. Is he... ?

14:14.619 --> 14:16.442
They're, um... They're
trying to stabilize him.

14:16.444 --> 14:17.566
He lost a lot of blood.

14:17.568 --> 14:19.055
- Oh, my God.
- No.

14:19.057 --> 14:20.857
Get it out.

14:24.828 --> 14:26.483
I have to go back to the station, okay?

14:26.485 --> 14:28.297
I got a mandatory callback, but...

14:28.299 --> 14:30.533
will you call me with any news?

14:30.535 --> 14:32.635
Of course. I'm... I'm
not going anywhere.

14:43.181 --> 14:44.547
Okay, scene's secure.

14:44.549 --> 14:46.215
What the hell are you doing?

14:46.217 --> 14:48.184
You holding something
in your right hand?

14:48.186 --> 14:49.218
Your gun hand?

14:49.220 --> 14:50.860
How many times I gotta tell you

14:50.862 --> 14:52.539
to keep your gun hand free at all times?

14:52.541 --> 14:53.589
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

14:53.591 --> 14:55.211
You've been on this job a whole
year, and you're still making

14:55.213 --> 14:57.326
the same dumb mistakes you've
been making since day one.

14:57.328 --> 14:58.594
You want to end up like Rios?

14:58.596 --> 14:59.862
Whoa, Tim.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.931
That's enough, man.

15:01.933 --> 15:02.965
Excuse me?

15:02.967 --> 15:04.634
You don't have to talk to her like that.

15:04.636 --> 15:05.668
She's my Boot.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.570
I'll talk to her however
the hell I want to

15:07.572 --> 15:10.202
so she doesn't end up eating
through a tube the rest of her life.

15:10.204 --> 15:11.337
You got that?

15:12.243 --> 15:13.510
Let's go, Boot.

15:15.786 --> 15:17.613
I did not need saving.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.355
I kind of went overboard
with the crime scene photos.

15:26.357 --> 15:27.924
Better safe than sorry.

15:38.527 --> 15:39.682
No sign of the suspect?

15:39.684 --> 15:42.238
No, he got away clean. But
we did recover his weapon.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.639
Nine-mil. Recently fired.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.241
Good work. Anything else?

15:45.243 --> 15:48.058
Uh, yes. The car is
registered to a dealership...

15:48.060 --> 15:49.558
International Luxury Auto.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.714
- Stolen?
- Not reported.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.050
We need to run background checks
on the dealership employees.

15:54.052 --> 15:56.414
Already happening. But
we would get a much faster ID

15:56.416 --> 15:58.521
from the mobile fingerprint
unit inside your car.

15:58.523 --> 16:00.957
We pulled a clean print from
the driver's side window.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.060
Uh, yeah. Great.

16:10.301 --> 16:11.968
Any update on Chris?

16:11.970 --> 16:13.959
- Nothing yet.
- How is it out there?

16:13.961 --> 16:15.037
Controlled chaos.

16:15.039 --> 16:17.574
We're spread thin through two divisions.

16:22.413 --> 16:25.982
And just like that,
our suspect has a name.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.985
Serj Derian. Number one on
Robbery-Homicide's hit list.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.152
Younger brother of Ruben,

16:30.154 --> 16:31.854
the head of the Derian crime family.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.656
Linked to drug trafficking, extortion,

16:33.658 --> 16:34.797
kidnapping, and murder.

16:34.799 --> 16:37.026
But so far, none of
the charges have stuck.

16:37.028 --> 16:40.329
Now, remember, this guy has
already shot one cop today.

16:40.331 --> 16:42.765
I need you focused, not angry.

16:49.874 --> 16:50.917
LAPD!

16:50.919 --> 16:54.010
Serj Derian, come out
with your hands up!

17:00.284 --> 17:02.051
- Clear!
- Clear!

17:02.053 --> 17:03.219
- Clear!
- Clear!

17:03.221 --> 17:05.121
- Clear!
- Clear!

17:05.123 --> 17:06.222
Clear!

17:08.326 --> 17:09.358
He's not here.

17:11.162 --> 17:12.261
Hey, you gotta go.

17:12.262 --> 17:14.063
I know, but how can I?

17:14.065 --> 17:15.196
Serj wasn't home.

17:15.199 --> 17:17.366
Bradford and Chen are
searching his stuff right now.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.834
What'd I miss?

17:18.836 --> 17:21.037
Harper has a custody
hearing in about an hour,

17:21.039 --> 17:22.672
and she's conflicted about leaving,

17:22.674 --> 17:25.741
but I say number-one priority
has to be getting Lila back.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.510
Tell me I'm right.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.744
100%.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.413
Look, take it from me.

17:30.415 --> 17:33.916
Nothing is more important than family.

17:33.918 --> 17:35.051
Alright, fine.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.286
But I will be back right after.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.354
Hey.

17:38.356 --> 17:40.861
Take my unmarked. I'll
ride back with Nolan.

17:40.863 --> 17:43.193
- Thanks.
- Give Lila a hug for me.

17:48.232 --> 17:49.765
What are we looking for?

17:49.767 --> 17:51.521
Anything that could lead us to Serj.

17:53.071 --> 17:54.770
- What the hell?
- You got something?

17:54.772 --> 17:56.906
Yeah, a police report.

17:56.908 --> 17:58.141
There's more.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.876
"Suspect... Serj Derian".

18:00.878 --> 18:02.378
His name's all over these.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.846
Someone inside the department

18:03.848 --> 18:05.948
has been feeding intel
to the Armenian mob.

18:05.950 --> 18:07.083
And by someone, you mean...

18:07.085 --> 18:08.118
A dirty cop.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.181
Come in.

18:13.183 --> 18:14.283
Close the door.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.983
So, Bradford and Chen just found
confidential police documents

18:21.985 --> 18:23.084
in Serj's home.

18:23.086 --> 18:27.423
Case files for LAPD
investigations into the Derians.

18:29.491 --> 18:31.565
You saying there's a mole
inside the department?

18:31.567 --> 18:34.234
It'd explain why these
guys have been so slippery.

18:34.236 --> 18:36.837
So, we haven't been able to
make a single case against them.

18:36.839 --> 18:38.295
What does internal affairs say?

18:38.297 --> 18:40.020
They're mobilizing.

18:40.022 --> 18:41.875
Commander West was keeping
it close to the vest,

18:41.877 --> 18:45.713
but I got a sense they already
have a few cops in mind.

18:45.715 --> 18:47.414
So, what do we do in the meantime?

18:47.416 --> 18:48.682
Serj's older brother... Ruben.

18:49.719 --> 18:52.419
He runs things from
his house in Glendale.

18:52.421 --> 18:54.188
There's a chance Serj is holed up there.

18:54.190 --> 18:57.424
If not, Ruben's the first
person we should be questioning.

18:57.426 --> 18:58.983
Why are you only telling me all this?

18:58.985 --> 19:00.674
I know I can trust you.

19:00.676 --> 19:02.666
So I'm making you acting detective

19:02.668 --> 19:04.557
until this calms down.

19:04.559 --> 19:06.600
You already passed the
exam, so I might as well

19:06.602 --> 19:09.061
take advantage of you
until the brass realizes

19:09.063 --> 19:11.271
- what they're missing out on.
- Copy that.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.207
So, round up as many units as you need,

19:13.209 --> 19:15.702
call a judge for a
telephonic search warrant.

19:15.704 --> 19:17.405
Yes, sir.

19:20.616 --> 19:23.051
I've wanted this for
so long, so thank you.

19:23.819 --> 19:26.721
Just wish a cop didn't have
to get shot for it to happen.

19:28.457 --> 19:29.923
We answer the call when we get it.

19:36.632 --> 19:38.233
Still thinking about Grace?

19:39.402 --> 19:40.634
You're a good detective.

19:40.636 --> 19:41.835
You're an easy case.

19:41.837 --> 19:44.438
Days like today just make you realize

19:44.440 --> 19:46.907
how little time you could have.

19:46.909 --> 19:48.609
Time I want to spend with her.

19:48.611 --> 19:51.051
That's the kind of thing you
might regret not telling someone.

19:52.861 --> 19:54.816
You know what? When
we get back to the station,

19:54.818 --> 19:56.483
I'm gonna book the evidence
and I'm gonna call her.

19:56.485 --> 19:57.584
Call her?

19:57.586 --> 19:59.246
You better get your ass over there

19:59.248 --> 20:00.481
and tell her in person.

20:03.325 --> 20:06.360
They're putting together a
raid at Ruben Derian's house.

20:06.362 --> 20:07.494
Is Serj there?

20:07.496 --> 20:09.152
Only one way to find out.

20:10.212 --> 20:13.500
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Attach us to that ATL.

20:21.677 --> 20:24.344
Lock and load.

20:24.346 --> 20:25.612
Any eye on Serj?

20:25.614 --> 20:27.771
Not yet, but there's at least
a handful of unknowns inside.

20:27.773 --> 20:29.683
- What's the game plan?
- House is around the corner.

20:29.685 --> 20:31.985
I'll have officers cover the perimeter
while the rest of us breach.

20:31.987 --> 20:34.521
I would put Stapleton, Cole,
and Brady on the 3/4 corner.

20:34.523 --> 20:36.690
Jennings and Sanchez,
they can take the 2 side.

20:36.692 --> 20:38.493
We'll join you in the stack.

20:40.529 --> 20:43.163
- Sorry. Second nature.
- All good, sir.

20:43.165 --> 20:45.532
You're the senior detective
on site. Operation is yours.

20:45.534 --> 20:46.723
Okay.

20:46.725 --> 20:47.801
Uh...

20:47.803 --> 20:48.836
You're acting detective?

20:48.838 --> 20:50.704
- For the day.
- Doing great.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.506
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:52.508 --> 20:54.408
Wish I was breaching with you guys.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.376
It'd feel good to subdue a
felon with force right now.

20:56.378 --> 20:57.711
Only temporarily.

20:57.713 --> 20:58.746
- Be safe.
- You too.

21:00.716 --> 21:02.316
Police! Open up!

21:02.318 --> 21:03.851
Hands up! Turn around!

21:11.601 --> 21:13.557
- Clear!
- Clear!

21:13.559 --> 21:14.661
Stand up!

21:14.663 --> 21:16.153
Hands on your head! Turn around!

21:16.155 --> 21:17.564
What can I do for you?

21:17.566 --> 21:19.867
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

21:19.869 --> 21:21.155
You could have just called.

21:22.204 --> 21:24.338
So much banging and
crashing just to discover

21:24.340 --> 21:26.273
that my brother didn't randomly drop by.

21:26.275 --> 21:27.641
All clear. No sign of Serj.

21:27.643 --> 21:30.344
Mr. Derian, we'd like you to come
with us to the station voluntarily.

21:30.346 --> 21:31.411
Yeah, you bet.

21:31.413 --> 21:33.480
Uh, look, why don't I meet
you guys down there, huh?

21:33.482 --> 21:34.548
There's only a half-hour left

21:34.550 --> 21:36.517
in what has been the
best game of the season.

21:36.519 --> 21:38.619
- It's zero-zero.
- A tactical master class.

21:39.688 --> 21:41.588
Your brother shot a cop.
You're coming with us now.

21:41.590 --> 21:42.689
On what charge?

21:42.691 --> 21:44.358
You're a material witness
to your brother's actions,

21:44.360 --> 21:46.608
and refusing to help could be construed

21:46.610 --> 21:48.428
- as aiding and abetting.
- Let's move.

21:58.307 --> 22:00.407
Clear.

22:01.544 --> 22:03.076
Negative. No response.

22:04.947 --> 22:06.280
Alright, book the evidence.

22:06.282 --> 22:07.481
I'm gonna check and see what's next.

22:07.483 --> 22:08.582
Right.

22:23.566 --> 22:24.731
Auto registration.

22:24.733 --> 22:27.000
And could I get a firearm tag?

22:28.771 --> 22:29.837
Wait a minute.

22:31.407 --> 22:32.773
W-Wait.

22:32.775 --> 22:34.074
Uh...

22:34.076 --> 22:37.578
Th... Uh, there was
a gun. There was, um...

22:37.580 --> 22:39.413
There's supposed to be a gun.

22:43.319 --> 22:44.418
Sorry.

23:24.693 --> 23:26.994
Yeah, I understand. Thank you.

23:29.131 --> 23:31.365
Sir, the weapon we
recovered from the Maserati,

23:31.367 --> 23:33.635
the gun that was used
to shoot Officer Rios.

23:34.703 --> 23:37.472
I secured it, and now it's missing.

23:41.407 --> 23:44.645
That call was from the hospital.

23:44.647 --> 23:45.812
Chris Rios just died.

23:48.150 --> 23:51.885
That gun is now a murder weapon.

23:51.887 --> 23:53.053
And you lost it.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
Can we talk about what happened earlier?

24:04.775 --> 24:06.041
When earlier?

24:06.043 --> 24:07.409
With Emmett.

24:07.411 --> 24:08.777
There's nothing to say.

24:08.779 --> 24:10.479
The guy tried to tell
me how to do my job.

24:10.481 --> 24:12.414
On today of all days.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.206
I don't care if he's your boyfriend...

24:14.208 --> 24:15.964
He's not.

24:15.966 --> 24:18.022
Actually, he's a little
dead to me right now.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.732
You may be 30 days from
crossing the finish line,

24:20.734 --> 24:22.657
but the only thing that
happens when you cross it

24:22.659 --> 24:25.850
is that I won't be there to
keep you from washing out.

24:25.852 --> 24:27.308
Or worse.

24:27.310 --> 24:28.493
So you better believe

24:28.495 --> 24:30.496
this next month is gonna be tough.

24:32.266 --> 24:34.000
'Cause I know you can handle it.

24:37.271 --> 24:39.404
That's oddly sweet.

24:39.406 --> 24:41.740
But you're not the one
I'm mad at right now.

24:41.742 --> 24:43.242
I'm used to you. I...

24:43.244 --> 24:45.244
Okay, look.

24:45.246 --> 24:48.547
You are only gonna
hear me say this once.

24:48.549 --> 24:49.715
Emmett's a fireman.

24:49.717 --> 24:50.749
They're idiots.

24:50.751 --> 24:52.751
But they mean well.

24:52.753 --> 24:54.286
And Emmett...

24:55.422 --> 24:56.823
... he's a not-bad fireman.

24:57.949 --> 24:59.371
Don't write him off.

24:59.373 --> 25:02.242
I thought we weren't going
to discuss my personal life.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.874
We're friends.

25:07.635 --> 25:08.701
Hmm.

25:10.304 --> 25:11.370
Hey.

25:15.609 --> 25:17.609
Chris died.

25:23.751 --> 25:25.351
Oh, no.

25:27.588 --> 25:30.422
I can't leave you alone for a second.

25:30.424 --> 25:32.291
Hey. How was court? Did the judge...

25:32.293 --> 25:34.159
He's gonna make his
decision tomorrow morning.

25:34.161 --> 25:36.228
But how about we focus
on the murder weapon

25:36.230 --> 25:37.950
that went missing from the shop?

25:37.952 --> 25:41.166
Okay, you saw me bag it...

25:41.168 --> 25:43.402
and put it in the lock box.

25:43.404 --> 25:45.904
The only time we stopped
between the scene and the station

25:45.906 --> 25:47.606
was at Serj's house, for the raid.

25:47.608 --> 25:49.174
Could one of his guys have taken it?

25:49.176 --> 25:50.298
No, not possible.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.061
We had the perimeter completely
contained, and I locked the car.

25:53.063 --> 25:55.180
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

25:55.182 --> 25:57.559
Mostly sure. Almost mostly sure.

25:57.561 --> 26:00.463
Even if I didn't, it was
secured in the lock box.

26:01.655 --> 26:03.655
And there's no sign of forced entry.

26:03.657 --> 26:05.257
- None.
- You find the gun?

26:05.259 --> 26:07.159
No, and I don't think he's going to.

26:07.161 --> 26:08.226
Why?

26:08.228 --> 26:10.295
The lock box in the
shop wasn't broken into,

26:10.297 --> 26:12.931
but the key for the boxes
is universal across the LAPD.

26:12.933 --> 26:14.499
You think a cop took the gun?

26:14.501 --> 26:16.668
It's the only logical explanation.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.704
We know there's a dirty
cop connected to Serj.

26:18.706 --> 26:20.806
They must have heard on the
radio I'd secured the weapon.

26:20.808 --> 26:22.941
How long were you away from
the shop during the raid?

26:22.943 --> 26:24.543
Uh, we were, what, 20 minutes?

26:24.545 --> 26:26.645
More than enough time for
one of the officers involved

26:26.647 --> 26:27.946
to take the gun.

26:27.948 --> 26:29.881
It makes sense, but it's cold comfort.

26:29.883 --> 26:31.483
Even if we get the weapon back,

26:31.485 --> 26:33.285
the chain of custody has been destroyed.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.387
The D.A. can't use it to convict Serj

26:35.389 --> 26:37.356
for the murder of Officer Rios.

26:37.358 --> 26:38.657
If we ever find the guy.

26:38.659 --> 26:39.791
Oh, we'll find him.

26:39.793 --> 26:41.626
I'm calling all the
officers from the raid

26:41.628 --> 26:42.728
back to the station.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.167
Officer Lopez will be in charge

26:44.169 --> 26:45.697
of going through all
the body cam footage.

26:45.699 --> 26:46.798
What can we do?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.867
You and Armstrong can
take a run at Ruben Derian.

26:48.869 --> 26:50.702
See if we can sweat
something out of him.

26:50.704 --> 26:52.204
It'd be my pleasure.

26:52.206 --> 26:53.705
Alright. That's all.

26:53.707 --> 26:55.407
Hey, Sarge?

26:55.409 --> 26:57.809
Look, Officer Nolan
conducted himself admirably

26:57.811 --> 26:58.844
throughout the raid.

26:58.846 --> 27:00.545
I don't think he's to
blame for what happened.

27:00.547 --> 27:02.647
That'll be my call, Detective.

27:02.649 --> 27:04.383
I'll deal with it
when the time is right.

27:04.385 --> 27:05.507
Sir...

27:05.509 --> 27:06.885
Nolan.

27:06.887 --> 27:09.721
You do not want to have this
conversation with me right now.

27:14.561 --> 27:16.428
Tell us about your brother.

27:16.430 --> 27:18.363
Serj? He's a nice guy.

27:18.365 --> 27:20.332
A bit of a free spirit.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.500
You two close?

27:21.502 --> 27:22.534
Sure.

27:22.536 --> 27:24.336
But I haven't seen him in a couple days.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.871
He takes off sometimes.

27:25.873 --> 27:27.129
Hm.

27:27.131 --> 27:28.440
Wanderlust.

27:28.442 --> 27:30.575
Those Germans.

27:30.577 --> 27:32.577
They really have a word
for everything, don't they?

27:32.579 --> 27:34.513
But you reported his
car stolen this morning.

27:34.515 --> 27:36.381
An hour after it was used in an incident

27:36.383 --> 27:38.583
that ended with a dead police officer.

27:38.585 --> 27:40.585
The Maserati belongs to
the Derians' dealership.

27:40.587 --> 27:42.287
It was found missing during inventory.

27:42.289 --> 27:43.422
How convenient.

27:43.424 --> 27:45.690
Dozens of people have driven
that car in the past week.

27:45.692 --> 27:48.138
Now, my client has
been very cooperative,

27:48.140 --> 27:50.574
so if you don't have
any more questions...

27:51.698 --> 27:54.266
Alright, if you hear from
your brother, give us a call.

27:54.268 --> 27:55.700
He killed a cop.

27:55.702 --> 27:57.769
He is going to prison.

27:57.771 --> 27:59.304
It is up to you to decide

27:59.306 --> 28:01.773
whether or not you are going with him.

28:01.775 --> 28:03.242
I'll keep that in mind.

28:09.716 --> 28:11.483
Now what?

28:11.485 --> 28:14.545
We find a new way to flush
Serj out into the open.

28:14.547 --> 28:16.788
What the hell do you need
our body cams for, Sarge?

28:16.790 --> 28:18.457
Above your pay grade.

28:18.459 --> 28:19.525
Come on.

28:20.854 --> 28:21.987
Oh, hey, Cole.

28:22.896 --> 28:24.729
How you holding up?

28:24.731 --> 28:25.931
Not well.

28:25.933 --> 28:27.332
I should have said something.

28:27.334 --> 28:29.569
Hey, no. This... This is not your fault.

28:34.077 --> 28:35.599
House is around the corner.

28:35.601 --> 28:37.085
I'll have officers cover the perimeter

28:37.087 --> 28:38.210
while the rest of us breach.

28:38.212 --> 28:40.412
Okay, I would put Shelton,
Cole, and Boyd on the...

28:47.788 --> 28:50.589
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

28:55.896 --> 28:59.965
Double-O-Smitty. At your service.

28:59.967 --> 29:02.601
That man clearly does not know
the "on" button from the "off".

29:16.483 --> 29:18.884
Officer Erin Cole never switched
her camera on during the raid.

29:18.886 --> 29:20.936
She's a rookie, so it could
just be a mental error.

29:20.938 --> 29:23.159
Or she did it on purpose
to cover up taking the gun.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.523
Either way, we need to talk to her.

29:24.525 --> 29:27.012
I can reach out to her T.O.,
call her back to the station.

29:27.014 --> 29:29.306
No need. Cole's ID badge
shows she's still here...

29:29.308 --> 29:30.364
in the locker room.

29:38.872 --> 29:40.839
She dumped everything that
we could use to trace her.

29:40.841 --> 29:41.841
She's running.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.296
How was Officer Cole at the Academy?

29:49.298 --> 29:50.390
Solid.

29:50.392 --> 29:52.281
Yeah, she was a go-getter.

29:52.283 --> 29:54.429
I mean, she wasn't the
strongest or the fastest,

29:54.431 --> 29:56.086
but she made up for it with passion.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.227
I certainly wouldn't have flagged her

29:57.229 --> 29:58.866
as someone who'd betray the badge.

29:58.868 --> 30:00.554
- And as a rookie?
- Maybe she didn't turn.

30:00.556 --> 30:02.370
Maybe she was rotten from the onset.

30:02.372 --> 30:03.504
Meaning what?

30:03.506 --> 30:06.595
She was put into the
department by the Derian family

30:06.597 --> 30:07.697
as a mole?

30:10.980 --> 30:12.480
- Anything?
- No.

30:12.482 --> 30:14.215
No sign of Cole yet.

30:14.217 --> 30:17.218
An S.I.S. team conducted
a raid on her home

30:17.220 --> 30:18.953
and searched the home
of two family members.

30:18.955 --> 30:21.255
- Nothing.
- Forensic Accounting says there's been

30:21.257 --> 30:23.291
no financial activity
on any of her accounts.

30:23.293 --> 30:24.392
Well, she's a cop.

30:24.394 --> 30:26.059
Smart enough to know how
we're gonna try and catch her.

30:26.061 --> 30:29.263
And to know that every available
uniform will be looking for her.

30:29.265 --> 30:30.965
She'll probably flee to somewhere

30:30.967 --> 30:32.467
that's familiar to her.

30:32.469 --> 30:34.268
The question is, how will she get there?

30:34.270 --> 30:35.603
We put a BOLO out county-wide.

30:35.605 --> 30:37.438
The Sheriff's Department, Metro Transit,

30:37.440 --> 30:39.199
Port Police all been notified.

30:39.201 --> 30:41.210
- Eyes are open.
- John.

30:42.151 --> 30:43.985
Uh... excuse me.

30:45.141 --> 30:47.181
I'm so sorry about Officer Rios.

30:47.183 --> 30:48.216
Thank you.

30:48.218 --> 30:50.452
I know that you guys are
working through the night.

30:51.730 --> 30:54.455
I wasn't sure what to get...
I mean, dinner, breakfast?

30:54.457 --> 30:56.858
No, uh, no, pizza always plays.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.359
You guys want to grab this for the... ?

30:58.361 --> 30:59.428
Yeah.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.366
Anyway, I mean, I-I know you're busy.

31:08.171 --> 31:10.211
I just want you to know
that I'm thinking about you.

31:11.341 --> 31:12.941
I'm thinking about you, too.

31:14.844 --> 31:16.878
Um...

31:16.880 --> 31:18.546
thank you so much for the food.

31:18.548 --> 31:20.014
Uh...

31:20.016 --> 31:21.083
talk soon?

31:22.018 --> 31:23.218
Yeah.

31:25.355 --> 31:27.054
Bye.

31:31.995 --> 31:34.228
Hey. Everything okay?

31:34.230 --> 31:37.035
Um, no. But that's a
problem for another day.

31:37.037 --> 31:39.305
Right now, we need to find Erin.

31:41.137 --> 31:42.503
What are you looking at?

31:42.505 --> 31:45.006
I'm just going over all
her social media accounts.

31:45.008 --> 31:46.750
I'm just hoping to
find something in here

31:46.752 --> 31:49.053
that'll give us a clue
as to where she went.

31:49.979 --> 31:51.345
I just don't get it.

31:51.347 --> 31:53.648
She's so happy and carefree.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.650
W-What could happen to make her do this?

31:55.652 --> 31:58.477
Yeah, I mean, social media
shows the side of us

31:58.479 --> 32:00.113
that we want people to see.

32:03.526 --> 32:04.559
"#RVlife".

32:04.561 --> 32:06.494
The other night at the bar,

32:06.496 --> 32:09.019
Erin said she wanted to
go on a road trip in an RV

32:09.021 --> 32:10.665
just as soon as the
Thirty Day Push was over.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.066
You think that's her escape plan?

32:12.068 --> 32:13.501
It would give her mobility.

32:13.503 --> 32:15.343
It would give her a place
to hide off the grid.

32:28.465 --> 32:30.855
The house the RV is registered to

32:30.857 --> 32:32.042
is at the end of this street.

32:32.044 --> 32:33.087
On our go.

32:33.089 --> 32:35.089
I hope she surrenders without a fight.

32:35.091 --> 32:36.223
I wouldn't count on it.

32:36.225 --> 32:37.625
If she's in deep with the Derians,

32:37.627 --> 32:40.428
she knows they'll kill her
to keep her from talking.

32:44.210 --> 32:45.232
She's on the move!

32:46.936 --> 32:48.369
Watch out. Watch out!

32:51.975 --> 32:53.240
Control, 7-Adam-15.

32:53.242 --> 32:55.943
We just got 245'd by
suspect Cole in an RV.

32:55.945 --> 32:57.712
Beige RV, Arizona plates.

32:57.714 --> 33:01.148
Alpha-Bravo-7-9, heading north
on Mission Road towards 1st.

33:26.175 --> 33:27.475
Look out.

33:39.689 --> 33:41.288
Whoa!

33:47.664 --> 33:48.763
Look out!

33:50.156 --> 33:51.916
She's gonna go through.
She's not gonna stop.

34:01.644 --> 34:02.777
Attention, all units.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.046
Air-16 tracking suspect vehicle

34:05.048 --> 34:08.482
heading east on Colorado
towards Pasadena.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.545
- Clear.
- Clear.

34:19.547 --> 34:20.753
- What do we got?
- She's on foot.

34:20.755 --> 34:22.449
- Couple minutes ahead.
- Alright, head inside.

34:22.452 --> 34:24.130
Split up. She could be anywhere.

34:26.302 --> 34:28.636
Control, suspect is on foot.
Rose Bowl Stadium.

34:28.638 --> 34:30.237
Requesting backup and airship.

35:10.413 --> 35:11.446
Erin!

35:12.606 --> 35:14.129
Erin!

35:14.131 --> 35:15.353
Drop that gun right now!

35:15.355 --> 35:17.218
I can't.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.220
Come on, Erin.

35:19.222 --> 35:21.589
It's me. You know me.

35:21.591 --> 35:23.724
We've been through a lot
together. You can talk to me.

35:23.726 --> 35:25.193
Just talk to me.

35:26.388 --> 35:28.444
I never wanted this.

35:28.446 --> 35:30.264
I know.

35:32.435 --> 35:35.202
I had problems.

35:35.204 --> 35:38.239
Debts, and... they paid them.

35:38.241 --> 35:40.741
And and then they owned me.

35:40.743 --> 35:42.243
Who did?

35:42.245 --> 35:43.377
The Derians?

35:43.379 --> 35:45.446
I finally paid them back,

35:45.448 --> 35:46.881
and I told Serj I was done,

35:46.883 --> 35:49.116
but he... he pulled a gun

35:49.118 --> 35:51.452
and he tried to kill me
when I wouldn't scare and...

35:51.454 --> 35:53.320
The shots fired call.

35:53.322 --> 35:55.122
Serj, he... he got caught flat-footed,

35:55.124 --> 35:58.425
and he... he jumped
in the Maserati, and...

35:58.427 --> 36:00.628
Chris is dead because of me.

36:00.630 --> 36:03.831
No, no, no! Wait, no! Don't! Just...

36:03.833 --> 36:06.634
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

36:06.636 --> 36:09.770
Okay, you can start to make this right.

36:09.772 --> 36:10.938
Just...

36:13.252 --> 36:15.075
... name names.

36:15.077 --> 36:16.600
Okay? Just testify.

36:20.197 --> 36:21.297
- Armstrong.
- No!

36:38.067 --> 36:41.502
Control, uh, requesting an R.A. unit.

36:41.504 --> 36:42.870
25-year-old female,

36:42.872 --> 36:44.371
multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

36:45.775 --> 36:46.935
Not conscious, not breathing.

37:00.096 --> 37:01.761
I know you're all exhausted.

37:02.861 --> 37:08.164
The past twenty-four hours have
brought a... lot of heartache.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.300
You did great work out there.

37:10.302 --> 37:11.735
Remember that.

37:11.737 --> 37:14.671
I was notified that
Rios's memorial service

37:14.673 --> 37:15.773
is Saturday afternoon.

37:18.043 --> 37:19.709
Go home, get some rest.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.580
Nolan.

37:23.582 --> 37:24.988
I'm gonna need you to stay behind.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.679
IA is requesting your statement

37:26.681 --> 37:28.143
while it's still fresh in your mind.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.212
Yes, sir.

37:32.224 --> 37:33.624
Hey.

37:36.561 --> 37:38.061
You okay?

37:40.065 --> 37:42.065
I thought I had a chance
at getting through to her.

37:46.071 --> 37:47.203
I had no choice.

37:47.205 --> 37:49.606
Oh, I...

37:49.608 --> 37:50.941
I know.

37:52.611 --> 37:54.210
Just such a waste.

38:02.587 --> 38:04.555
You want me to make you some tea?

38:05.857 --> 38:07.124
I'm okay.

38:09.928 --> 38:11.628
Come here.

38:19.271 --> 38:21.271
Doesn't feel real, you know?

38:21.273 --> 38:23.306
I know.

38:32.117 --> 38:33.260
It's Emmett.

38:33.262 --> 38:35.652
Yeah, uh, you two should talk.

38:43.829 --> 38:45.328
Hey.

38:45.330 --> 38:46.729
Hey.

38:48.133 --> 38:49.399
I screwed up.

38:50.936 --> 38:53.002
Yeah. You did.

38:57.742 --> 38:59.043
Come in.

39:05.817 --> 39:07.017
Uh...

39:10.989 --> 39:13.323
You're one of the toughest
women I've ever met.

39:13.325 --> 39:15.425
The last thing you need is a protector,

39:15.427 --> 39:18.695
and I didn't mean to imply that you did.

39:20.433 --> 39:21.455
I'm sorry.

39:23.178 --> 39:24.200
Thanks.

39:25.937 --> 39:27.370
I accept your apology.

39:29.174 --> 39:30.306
Really?

39:31.877 --> 39:33.309
Yes.

39:33.311 --> 39:34.777
Yes.

39:39.151 --> 39:41.317
You gotta get out of here.

39:44.022 --> 39:46.022
Alright.

39:46.024 --> 39:47.457
Whatever you say, boss.

39:49.895 --> 39:51.327
Will I see you tomorrow?

39:51.329 --> 39:52.896
Yeah. Yeah.

39:52.898 --> 39:53.997
Cool.

40:26.431 --> 40:27.630
How'd it go?

40:27.632 --> 40:31.401
Oh. Like opening a vein.

40:31.403 --> 40:33.069
You want to hear some good news?

40:33.071 --> 40:34.170
God, yes.

40:35.207 --> 40:37.874
My lawyer just called.

40:37.876 --> 40:40.076
I got my kid back.

40:40.078 --> 40:42.412
Shared custody. No conditions.

40:42.414 --> 40:44.347
That's everything you wanted.

40:44.349 --> 40:46.182
Nyla, congratulations!

40:46.184 --> 40:48.084
You helped me get here, John.

40:48.086 --> 40:50.660
Just... know that.

40:50.662 --> 40:51.717
Thank you.

40:53.258 --> 40:54.557
And thanks for telling me.

40:54.559 --> 40:57.861
Uh... I needed some good news today.

40:58.941 --> 40:59.963
Hey.

40:59.965 --> 41:01.531
Don't beat yourself up.

41:01.533 --> 41:03.299
You did everything you were supposed to.

41:03.301 --> 41:05.236
I just wish Erin would have given us

41:05.238 --> 41:06.951
something more concrete before she died,

41:06.953 --> 41:09.906
because Serj is gonna
walk for Chris's murder.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.315
... is dead because of me.

41:19.317 --> 41:21.818
No, no, no! Wait, no! Don't!

41:21.820 --> 41:22.885
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

41:22.887 --> 41:24.887
Okay, you can start to make this right.

41:24.889 --> 41:27.541
Name names, okay? Just testify.

41:27.543 --> 41:28.632
- Armstrong.
- No!

41:31.129 --> 41:32.895
Armstrong.

41:32.897 --> 41:35.398
She said his name before she saw him.

41:51.107 --> 41:52.796
You did good, my friend.

41:52.798 --> 41:54.150
Very good.
