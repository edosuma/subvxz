Ooh, girl, somebody pranked you good.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.093
Hey, does anyone hear a kitten?

02:15.176 --> 02:19.013
Because Poppy just got purr-anked.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.390
Branch.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.183
You're into Prank Day?

02:22.267 --> 02:26.604
Yeah, I took you for more
of a Crank Day kind of guy,

02:26.688 --> 02:28.148
if that was a thing,

02:28.231 --> 02:29.566
which it's not.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.735
Guys, please. I love Prank Day.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.905
It requires stealth, ingenuity,
and cunning.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.449
It's like this holiday
was designed just for me,

02:38.533 --> 02:40.160
the Prank Master.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.953
- Later.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.789
You are not the Prank Master, rookie.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.251
Sure I am.
After all, I'm always one step ahead.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.921
You got lucky once, but I assure you,
it won't happen again.

02:52.005 --> 02:52.839
[beep]

02:52.922 --> 02:54.883
Ha ha! Prank Master!

02:56.134 --> 02:58.052
He is going down.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.512
But I'm gonna need your help.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.307
Whatever you say, talking cake.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.977
And for you to stop licking me, Cooper.

03:07.979 --> 03:12.108
Hmm. [laughs]
This is gonna drive Branch crazy.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.526
Hey, guys, what's going on?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.527
[gasps]

03:14.611 --> 03:16.654
What did you do to my bunker?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.073
Ooh, do you feel a chill?

03:19.157 --> 03:21.910
'Cause you've been p-p-p-p-p-pranked!

03:21.993 --> 03:24.245
[beatboxing]

03:24.329 --> 03:27.415
No, no, no! I hate bright colors!

03:28.249 --> 03:31.544
-But I do love fertilizer.
-[beep]

03:31.628 --> 03:33.129
[Trolls] Oh!

03:33.212 --> 03:35.048
[laughs]

03:35.131 --> 03:38.218
It's like a smelly shower. [laughs]

03:39.469 --> 03:40.845
Ahh.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.180
Silly Poppy.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.058
You should've known.
The Prank Master can't be pranked.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.602
Can't be pranked. Uh, hello!

03:47.685 --> 03:49.562
We just painted your bunker!

03:49.646 --> 03:51.314
Prank Master!

03:51.397 --> 03:54.150
Oh, you mean this bunker?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.694
-[gasps]
-I'm inside your mind, Poppy.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.697
One step ahead.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.782
[both] No, you're not.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.784
Of course I was gonna say that.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.912
Stop it! [growling]

04:05.995 --> 04:08.164
[growls] By the end of this day,

04:08.248 --> 04:10.625
I'm gonna prank you so hard, Branch!

04:10.708 --> 04:13.253
Poppy, please, this isn't the spirit
of Prank Day.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.546
You're taking the pranks personally.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.673
Like Smidge did.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.800
[Trolls shuddering]

04:18.882 --> 04:20.093
No way.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.345
Wait, what happened with Smidge?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.974
It was Prank Day, years ago.

04:27.016 --> 04:31.521
[Guy Diamond]  The day started so well--
a pancake breakfast and a classic prank.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.772
Ugh!

04:32.855 --> 04:35.692
[laughter]

04:35.775 --> 04:38.778
[distorted laughter]

04:41.781 --> 04:43.950
[Guy Diamond]  But it ended in horror.

04:44.033 --> 04:44.867
[yells]

04:44.951 --> 04:47.245
[Trolls screaming]

04:47.328 --> 04:52.417
[Guy Diamond]  After that, Smidge agreed
never to participate in Prank Day again.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.711
She takes it too personally.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.340
Uh... I don't know how you're all
doing that with your eyes,

04:59.424 --> 05:02.051
but Smidge did not burn down
Troll Village.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.178
That's what it felt like.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.724
But don't worry, Guy.
I promise I won't go all Smidge.

05:07.807 --> 05:12.478
That's right, because she knows better
than to mess with the Prank Master.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.106
Right, Poppy? [smooches, exhales sharply]

05:15.189 --> 05:16.065
[growls]

05:16.149 --> 05:17.984
I'll show him who's the Prank Master.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.736
-[beep]
-[Branch] It's me!

05:19.819 --> 05:20.778
[growls]

05:20.862 --> 05:23.364
[Branch snoring]

05:23.448 --> 05:26.743
Oh, Branch, you sweet, simple Troll.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.120
Never nap outside on Prank Day.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.043
You must be a pirate, Branch,

05:35.126 --> 05:37.503
'cause you just walked the prank!

05:37.587 --> 05:39.756
[gasps] Oh, no.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.300
It's a trap! [screams]

05:42.383 --> 05:43.760
Ha ha.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.011
[continues screaming]

05:45.094 --> 05:46.888
Target 130 yards out.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.347
Wind out of the east.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.266
[continues screaming]

05:53.561 --> 05:54.937
And...

05:55.021 --> 05:56.856
[screaming]

05:56.939 --> 05:58.149
[Poppy] Oof!

05:58.733 --> 06:00.485
Sky, I need a water balloon.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.403
We're at Prank-Con Five.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.905
Say no more.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.364
[beep]

06:05.448 --> 06:09.202
Latex, pear-shaped,
tapered at the nozzle for easy filling.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.496
I've got her at 150ccs,

06:11.579 --> 06:14.916
but she'll hold up to 300
if you want to go full bath.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.833
Bigger.

06:15.917 --> 06:16.834
Hmm.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.044
[beep]

06:18.127 --> 06:19.295
The Magnum.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.005
-[Sky] This beauty'll--
-Bigger!

06:21.089 --> 06:23.508
-You don't mean...
-Bigger.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.761
[sighs] I always knew this day would come.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.639
[buzzer blares]

06:29.722 --> 06:32.558
[electronic music]

06:32.642 --> 06:34.185
[fanfare]

06:34.268 --> 06:36.270
[shimmering tone]

06:36.354 --> 06:38.773
Come to Poppy.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.442
[Trolls chattering]

06:43.528 --> 06:45.404
[Trolls gasp and whimper]

06:45.488 --> 06:48.449
Come out, come out,
wherever you are, Branch,

06:48.533 --> 06:51.494
and admit that I'm the Prank Master.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.788
[laughing maniacally]

06:53.871 --> 06:54.956
[Branch] Nope!

06:57.250 --> 07:01.504
The real Prank Master
is one step ahead of you again.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.006
Or, technically, I was several steps
behind you.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.007
Huh?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.677
I'm saying I followed you to Sky Toronto's

07:07.760 --> 07:10.138
and saw you get
that massive water balloon.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.264
Try to keep up.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.308
Now prepare to meet your Prank--

07:14.392 --> 07:16.394
Hey, I had a quip!

07:17.603 --> 07:19.480
[panting]

07:21.232 --> 07:22.984
[yells and grunts]

07:23.067 --> 07:23.901
Oof! Uh!

07:23.985 --> 07:25.736
So how's the prank war going?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.740
[panting]

07:29.824 --> 07:31.242
Aah! It's a dead end!

Uh... ah... [grunts]

07:36.747 --> 07:38.124
Yes!

07:38.207 --> 07:40.418
I earned this hot dog.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.335
Smidge!

07:41.419 --> 07:42.670
[Trolls] Smidge?

[Branch laughs] Did you guys see?

08:02.106 --> 08:05.026
I water ballooned Poppy
back to the Stone Age!

08:05.109 --> 08:06.652
[laughs] Huh?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.321
[foreboding music]

08:08.404 --> 08:10.281
Seriously, how are you guys doing that?

-Oh, no!

08:11.866 --> 08:14.869

08:16.329 --> 08:17.663
Who did this?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.082
-Nobody did it.
-It was bad luck!

08:20.166 --> 08:21.334
It was Satin.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.419
Happy Prank Day.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.255
Fine. If nobody's gonna fess up,

08:26.339 --> 08:31.344
I'm just gonna have to prank all of you.

[machines firing]

[chomps]

09:16.639 --> 09:18.307
[muffled] Too much pie.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.560
I'll never be able to eat again! [chomps]

09:20.643 --> 09:23.187
This is straight-up diabolical!

09:23.854 --> 09:25.982
How--how did Smidge set that up so fast?

09:26.065 --> 09:28.609
Her rage! It gives her unnatural powers!

09:28.693 --> 09:32.488
It's like she can peer into our souls
and prey upon our greatest weaknesses!

This is my fault.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.643
I did take your pranks too personally,

10:02.727 --> 10:04.395
but I think if we work together,

10:04.478 --> 10:06.439
we might just be able to get out of this--

Uh, yep. False alarm.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.798
There you are.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.676
I knew I could trust Branch
to look after you,

21:42.759 --> 21:46.722

reliable Trolls I know.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.564
Look, Biggie, I know you trusted me,

21:55.647 --> 21:56.857
but I got to be honest.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.902
I lost Mr. Dinkles and spent the whole day
looking for him and lied about it.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.821
You lost Mr. Dinkles?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.491
Branch, he can't see your shame.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.994
Oh, right. I mean yes. I'm sorry.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
Oh, that's all right, Branch.
I lose him all the time.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.332
[both] You do?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.167
Oh, yeah. He's a slippery one.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.752
But now you know to look out for that

22:16.835 --> 22:20.005
when you watch him for the next couple
of days while I'm still healing.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.758
Biggie, it would be my honor.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.763
But I know someone who would love
to babysit Mr. Dinkles.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.433
You're right, Branch,
and I know she would do a great job.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.268
