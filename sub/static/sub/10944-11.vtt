00:01.765 --> 00:03.999
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:04.066 --> 00:06.134
So I found you a
new show-jumping coach.

00:06.201 --> 00:09.534
<i>Mallory,</i>
<i>this is Jeremy Hughes.</i>

00:09.605 --> 00:11.506
<i>See, Scott? His joints
are really swollen.</i>

00:11.573 --> 00:12.707
We're not trying
to sell you drugs.

00:12.775 --> 00:14.709
We just really wanna help
your horse.

00:14.777 --> 00:16.244
There's nothing I
care more about than buck.

00:16.311 --> 00:17.445
I know.

00:17.513 --> 00:19.280
But I can't afford
those drugs.

00:19.348 --> 00:21.181
I have the supplements
Scott prescribed.

00:21.249 --> 00:22.683
I don't want your charity, man.

00:22.751 --> 00:25.019
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for your horse.

00:25.086 --> 00:26.353
<i>We talked to Clint</i>

00:26.420 --> 00:28.388
about becoming
your foster parents.

00:32.493 --> 00:33.794
You think I'm happy
that the house burnt down?

00:33.862 --> 00:35.362
Really? Honestly?
Is that what you're saying?

00:35.429 --> 00:37.163
No! I know that you're not glad
that the house burned down,

00:37.230 --> 00:38.397
but obviously
it meant more to me

00:38.465 --> 00:39.632
than it did to you,

00:39.700 --> 00:40.933
and it's like,
it's like you're relieved

00:41.001 --> 00:42.601
that our dreams went up
in smoke.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.041
<i>- Mallory?</i>
<i>- Agh!</i>

00:49.576 --> 00:50.843
Look what you
made me do.

00:51.911 --> 00:53.912
Getting ready
for your lesson, I see.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.547
No. Why would you
say that?

00:55.614 --> 00:58.216
Oh, come on,
you've got it bad.

00:58.284 --> 01:00.819
You um...
You missed some.

01:02.254 --> 01:04.022
Okay,
but can you blame me?

01:04.090 --> 01:05.423
I mean Jeremy's
got everything:

01:05.491 --> 01:08.092
Looks, charm,
personality.

01:10.328 --> 01:11.862
Why is he hauling
a horse trailer?

01:11.930 --> 01:14.364
Do not embarrass me!

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.375 --> 01:27.677
So Mallory's ready for
a horse like Buckingham?

01:27.745 --> 01:29.278
Ah no, she's not.

01:29.346 --> 01:31.380
No offence, blondie.

01:31.448 --> 01:34.150
Uh, actually, I've been having
some problems with him again,

01:34.218 --> 01:36.186
and since you're
the behavior expert

01:36.253 --> 01:38.554
I was hoping you could take
a look at him for me.

01:38.622 --> 01:39.722
- I think Amy is far too busy--
- Yeah, sure,

01:39.789 --> 01:41.857
I'd love to.
Okay.

01:41.925 --> 01:43.192
Great.

01:43.259 --> 01:44.259
Come on.

01:46.730 --> 01:47.763
Hee-yah!

01:49.132 --> 01:50.866
Hee-yah!

01:51.434 --> 01:53.869
You are quite aware of
what we shovel into that, yes?

01:53.937 --> 01:55.170
Yes!

01:55.238 --> 01:56.070
I cleaned all the horse crap
out of it

01:56.138 --> 01:57.471
before I sat in it.

01:57.539 --> 01:59.440
Why exactly are you
in the yard cart?

01:59.507 --> 02:02.143
Well, remember when Amy had
those miniature horses pull her

02:02.211 --> 02:03.978
in that little wagon?

02:04.046 --> 02:06.147
You're gonna turn that thing
into a chuckwagon?

02:06.215 --> 02:07.576
Well, I thought maybe
there's a way

02:07.582 --> 02:09.050
I could hook it up
to Phoenix.

02:09.118 --> 02:10.417
Mm-mm,
that's crazy.

02:10.485 --> 02:12.119
Phoenix is not broke
to drive.

02:12.186 --> 02:13.253
Wait!

02:14.622 --> 02:17.323
Come on, where is your sense
of adventure?

02:17.391 --> 02:20.193
You could help me turn this
into a mini chuckwagon.

02:20.261 --> 02:23.196
You know, I'd really like to,
but I do have to work today.

02:23.264 --> 02:25.799
Oh, I get it.
You don't know how.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.033
Hey, I could figure
something out

02:27.101 --> 02:28.467
if I really wanted to.

02:28.534 --> 02:30.335
Really?

02:30.403 --> 02:32.304
That's awesome!
Where do we start?

02:33.573 --> 02:34.907
Where's Georgie?

02:34.941 --> 02:36.308
<i>Have you seen my grey tie?</i>

02:36.342 --> 02:38.210
Yes. It's with the
dry-cleaning stuff.

02:38.278 --> 02:39.145
What's this?
What's going on here?

02:39.212 --> 02:40.646
What're you making?

02:40.713 --> 02:43.015
Nothing. Just, uh,
blueberry pancakes, your favourite.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.482
That is totally unfair!

02:44.549 --> 02:45.817
You know I have to leave
in like ten minutes.

02:45.885 --> 02:47.252
<i>Maybe you can cancel</i>

02:47.319 --> 02:48.452
<i>and have a nice breakfast</i>
<i>with your family.</i>

02:48.553 --> 02:49.888
Mm, I can't.
You know that.

02:49.955 --> 02:51.256
I'm sorry this business trip
came up so late,

02:51.323 --> 02:52.957
but it's only gonna be
a couple of days.

02:53.025 --> 02:55.326
Yeah, except we have those
insurance forms due Monday,

02:55.394 --> 02:56.928
and my sponsor has really
been hounding me

02:56.996 --> 02:58.229
to write another blog post.

02:58.297 --> 02:59.730
I could use your help
around here.

02:59.798 --> 03:00.964
Well,
you'll get on a roll

03:01.032 --> 03:02.800
and get those done
in no time.

03:02.867 --> 03:05.202
Plus you guys got that
baby shower to go to, right?

03:05.270 --> 03:07.570
Oh! Please don't make me go!
I don't want to!

03:07.638 --> 03:09.072
It's gonna be fun, honey.
Now, wash up,

03:09.140 --> 03:10.380
we're having
blueberry pancakes.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.177
I hate blueberries,
and plus, I'm busy.

03:13.244 --> 03:15.012
I need duct tape
and poles.

03:15.079 --> 03:17.246
Really.
I'm afraid to ask.

03:17.314 --> 03:19.115
Just tell me
where they are.

03:19.183 --> 03:21.550
You'll find duct tape
underneath that sink

03:21.618 --> 03:23.252
right over there,

03:23.320 --> 03:26.355
and you might be able to find
something that resembles a pole

03:26.423 --> 03:28.424
<i>out behind the Quonset.</i>

03:28.491 --> 03:30.193
I really do need to know
what it is-

03:30.260 --> 03:31.360
don't slam that...

03:31.428 --> 03:32.493
<i>Door!</i>

03:36.799 --> 03:38.800
Hey, I mean I know I
said he was having some issues,

03:38.868 --> 03:41.002
but I think we can go
a little higher than that.

03:41.070 --> 03:43.939
Let's just start here,
okay?

03:49.644 --> 03:51.011
You do realize
you just took over

03:51.079 --> 03:53.013
my entire lesson.

04:11.232 --> 04:12.999
Now he's being lazy.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.301
It's like he's lost his desire
or something.

04:15.369 --> 04:16.903
No. That's not it.

04:18.172 --> 04:19.605
He's limping now,

04:19.673 --> 04:21.639
and I don't think it's from
knocking down this rail.

04:21.707 --> 04:22.908
There's something going on.

04:22.976 --> 04:24.676
Maybe you're working him
too hard.

04:24.744 --> 04:25.777
No. I rested
him for a week

04:25.845 --> 04:27.913
and it hasn't made
a difference.

04:27.981 --> 04:30.215
This whole season's gone
completely off the rails.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.818
We haven't even been covering
our entrance fees lately.

04:33.887 --> 04:35.587
Well, that's not
the horse's fault.

04:35.654 --> 04:37.588
Oh no,
I'm not blaming Buckingham.

04:37.655 --> 04:38.689
I'm blaming him.

05:26.001 --> 05:27.335
Hey, uh, those
drugs you gave me,

05:27.403 --> 05:29.871
they're not working.

05:29.939 --> 05:31.506
They're not helping
with his joint pain at all?

05:31.574 --> 05:33.475
No. They've made it worse.

05:33.543 --> 05:34.910
Well,
that's not possible.

05:34.977 --> 05:36.077
There must be something else
going on, Jeremy.

05:36.145 --> 05:37.546
You should get him
re-assessed then.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.448
Oh yeah? So your clinic
can gouge me

05:39.515 --> 05:41.549
with more of your
expensive tests?

05:41.616 --> 05:42.850
Yeah.

05:42.918 --> 05:44.585
Hey, we're not the bad guys
here, okay?

05:44.653 --> 05:45.753
You're the one
who's sitting back

05:45.821 --> 05:47.020
and letting him suffer.
Again.

05:47.088 --> 05:48.388
Yeah?

05:48.457 --> 05:50.123
Okay, okay. It's not just
your jumping career

05:50.191 --> 05:51.859
that's on the line,
all right?

05:51.927 --> 05:53.393
<i>Buckingham's health</i>
<i>is at stake too,</i>

05:53.462 --> 05:56.795
so maybe you should just
let Scott have a look.

05:57.898 --> 05:59.065
Yeah, call him.

06:07.808 --> 06:09.342
Easy, Buckingham.

06:10.644 --> 06:11.444
It's okay.
Scott knows what he's doing.

06:11.512 --> 06:12.644
You can trust him.

06:16.015 --> 06:17.182
You know I couldn't
help but notice

06:17.249 --> 06:18.850
that someone's a little
smitten with you.

06:18.885 --> 06:22.218
Yeah, that vet girl's
really been checking me out.

06:22.822 --> 06:23.989
<i>Who? Her?</i>

06:24.056 --> 06:25.457
Big time.

06:25.525 --> 06:27.693
No, I was talking
about Mallory.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.394
Blondie?
That's kinda cute.

06:33.599 --> 06:35.199
She even started
back working at Maggie's

06:35.266 --> 06:37.234
so that she can pay
for extra lessons.

06:37.302 --> 06:38.736
Hey, look.
He's not limping.

06:41.339 --> 06:42.673
<i>Atta boy.</i>

06:43.609 --> 06:45.642
Hey, he's moving
like he used to.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.878
How did you do that?

06:49.313 --> 06:50.981
Uh, we gave him something
to block the nerve supply

06:51.048 --> 06:53.282
to the affected area.

06:53.350 --> 06:54.918
And it got rid of
the lameness.

06:54.986 --> 06:57.220
Yeah, looks like it.

06:57.287 --> 06:58.788
So this is a good thing?

06:58.856 --> 07:01.423
No, actually it's not.

07:01.491 --> 07:03.291
At least we know what's wrong
with the horse.

07:10.734 --> 07:11.967
Hi.

07:12.903 --> 07:15.004
Um... I need your help
with something.

07:15.071 --> 07:17.406
Sure, honey,
what is it?

07:17.473 --> 07:20.509
I need to attach these
to my chuckwagon.

07:20.576 --> 07:22.110
Your what?

07:22.178 --> 07:23.345
Don't tell Jack.

07:23.413 --> 07:25.613
He'll have some big attitude
about it.

07:25.681 --> 07:28.750
But Caleb was helping me
and I can't find him anywhere.

07:28.817 --> 07:31.420
I just have to finish
filling out these forms,

07:31.487 --> 07:33.320
but I...
I can help you later, okay?

07:33.388 --> 07:36.290
Yeah...
Sure, fine.

07:39.227 --> 07:42.295
Ugh! No, I am not hitting
the wrong key.

07:42.363 --> 07:44.064
Stop doing that!

07:45.699 --> 07:48.134
I am not putting in
a decimal point!

07:48.202 --> 07:49.735
I find yelling at the
computer won't help much.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.937
You really gotta smack it

07:51.004 --> 07:52.638
if you wanna get anything
out of it.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.940
<i> Caleb!</i>

07:54.007 --> 07:55.708
Georgie's looking for you.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.343
Oh! I'm not here,
okay?

07:58.878 --> 08:00.045
So what's the problem?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.780
This insurance form
keeps giving me

08:01.847 --> 08:04.450
the same error message.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.319
Yeah, I was real sorry
to hear about the fire.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.520
If something like that happened
to my trailer,

08:08.588 --> 08:10.355
if it went up in smoke
like that...

08:10.423 --> 08:13.425
After all the work
you guys put in...

08:16.428 --> 08:18.096
I'm... I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

08:18.163 --> 08:19.163
<i>It's okay.</i>

08:19.231 --> 08:20.511
I want someone to pick up
a stick

08:20.532 --> 08:21.972
and help me hit
all these curve balls

08:22.033 --> 08:24.635
that are flying
at my head!

08:24.703 --> 08:26.170
I think you mean bat.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.206
Stick, bat, whatever.

08:28.273 --> 08:29.673
<i>Well, you've
got Peter, right?</i>

08:29.708 --> 08:31.174
<i>Not really.</i>

08:32.143 --> 08:35.145
It's just he's always there
and I'm always here,

08:35.212 --> 08:37.114
and I need him
to put our family first

08:37.181 --> 08:38.715
and stop bolting on me

08:38.782 --> 08:42.051
<i>every time I need him most,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

08:43.821 --> 08:44.887
I'm scared.

08:46.189 --> 08:47.623
There, I said it.

08:49.359 --> 08:51.994
I don't wanna fail
with Georgie.

08:55.932 --> 08:58.167
You must think
I'm such a crybaby.

08:58.235 --> 08:59.935
Mmm.
You shoulda seen me

09:00.003 --> 09:02.803
the last time
I got thrown off a bull.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.947
Poor Jeremy.

09:13.015 --> 09:15.816
Poor Buckingham
is more like it.

09:15.884 --> 09:17.018
Yeah, a damaged
navicular bone

09:17.085 --> 09:19.253
could put an end
to his jumping days.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.623
Well, not necessarily.
He's got options.

09:22.690 --> 09:23.890
I don't know.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.725
The only option here
is to retire the horse.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.327
Well, let's not jump
the gun.

09:27.395 --> 09:28.629
We can always re-shoe him,

09:28.696 --> 09:29.929
and give him some
anti-inflammatories.

09:29.997 --> 09:31.331
Yeah, I know,

09:31.399 --> 09:32.633
but it just seems like
such a short-term solution

09:32.700 --> 09:34.967
for a high-performance
horse.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.336
- You're right.
- Thank you.

09:37.404 --> 09:38.371
That's why
I hope Jeremy

09:38.438 --> 09:40.939
seriously considers
de-nerving.

09:41.007 --> 09:42.275
Excuse me?

09:42.342 --> 09:43.742
It's a procedure where
the nerves are severed

09:43.810 --> 09:45.678
to eliminate sensation
in the affected area.

09:45.745 --> 09:47.480
Yeah, I know what it is,

09:47.548 --> 09:48.581
but it's only gonna make
the problem worse

09:48.649 --> 09:49.982
because he can't feel
the leg,

09:50.050 --> 09:52.317
so he's gonna keep exercising
on a lame leg.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.118
Well, it's worked miracles
for some jumpers.

09:54.187 --> 09:56.254
What miracles have you seen
where it's worked?

09:56.322 --> 09:57.656
I read this really
interesting article

09:57.723 --> 09:58.890
a few months back.

09:58.957 --> 10:00.925
I-I'm sorry,
you're read about it?

10:00.993 --> 10:02.294
I tell ya,

10:02.361 --> 10:05.029
giving that kind of news
never gets any easier.

10:05.097 --> 10:07.864
We should get back
to the clinic.

10:11.336 --> 10:13.604
Oh! Do you need me
to bring anything tomorrow?

10:13.672 --> 10:15.172
No, we're good.
Thanks though.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.740
See ya!

10:16.808 --> 10:19.276
She's coming
to your barbecue?

10:19.344 --> 10:20.411
Yeah. Why?

10:20.478 --> 10:21.612
I don't know.
I just thought you said

10:21.680 --> 10:23.446
you were having some kids
from your class.

10:23.514 --> 10:24.914
I am having some kids
from my class,

10:24.981 --> 10:27.817
but I thought
I'd invite Cassandra;

10:27.884 --> 10:28.818
She can give us
a little insight

10:28.885 --> 10:31.287
into first year
of vet school.

10:31.355 --> 10:33.289
You turned down my invite,
remember?

10:33.357 --> 10:35.958
I'd love to introduce them
to my fiancee.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.793
Your what?

10:37.861 --> 10:40.028
My fiancee.
What?

10:40.096 --> 10:42.731
It's just the first time
I've heard you call me that.

10:42.798 --> 10:44.099
Does it sound
kinda dorky?

10:44.166 --> 10:45.326
- Yeah, it really does.
- Does it?

10:47.203 --> 10:48.437
<i>Look, I'm sorry,</i>

10:48.504 --> 10:49.571
but maybe tomorrow
I can help you with-

10:49.639 --> 10:51.039
It's okay.

10:51.107 --> 10:52.874
Just don't make promises
you can't keep.

10:52.942 --> 10:54.642
Come on, Georgie.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.549
Well, that was fun.

11:03.518 --> 11:06.851
Grandpa, you really miss Lisa,
don't you?

11:07.155 --> 11:08.522
You should call her.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.057
Oh...

11:10.125 --> 11:12.325
I'm just trying to get
the battery outta this thing.

11:12.393 --> 11:15.726
There's no sense in letting it
run down completely.

11:16.063 --> 11:18.665
So I guess you didn't get
all your work done.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.900
I finished my insurance
forms, thank God!

11:20.968 --> 11:23.035
I haven't even started
my blog post yet.

11:23.103 --> 11:25.238
Thank you for watching Katie,
by the way.

11:25.306 --> 11:27.273
At least she doesn't hold it
against me.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.574
Not that I blame Georgie.

11:28.642 --> 11:29.875
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

11:29.942 --> 11:31.277
She's keeping pretty busy

11:31.344 --> 11:34.179
with whatever it is
she's been working on.

11:34.247 --> 11:35.781
She's building a chuckwagon.

11:35.848 --> 11:37.115
A chuckwagon?

11:37.183 --> 11:39.652
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

11:39.719 --> 11:41.887
It's okay.
I'll act surprised

11:41.954 --> 11:44.989
when I accidentally
come across it.

11:45.056 --> 11:46.924
See? I wish I could do stuff
like that with her, you know?

11:46.992 --> 11:49.093
Or horsey stuff
like Amy does,

11:49.161 --> 11:51.195
but I never have time.

11:51.263 --> 11:52.597
And I don't know...

11:52.665 --> 11:54.465
I'm no good at anything
Georgie's into.

11:54.533 --> 11:55.966
Come on, Lou...

11:56.034 --> 11:57.034
So I could use a little more
support around here,

11:57.102 --> 11:58.402
if you know what I mean.

11:58.469 --> 12:01.338
<i>I need your help</i>
<i>to connect with her.</i>

12:01.406 --> 12:03.840
What would you like me
to do?

12:03.908 --> 12:06.376
I don't know,
maybe you could convince her

12:06.444 --> 12:07.611
I'm not the most lame
foster parent

12:07.679 --> 12:09.346
in the whole world.

12:09.414 --> 12:10.447
Okay.

12:17.554 --> 12:18.688
Oh, hey!

12:18.755 --> 12:20.122
You here to give Mallory
another lesson?

12:20.190 --> 12:22.090
I wanted to talk to you
about Buckingham.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.328
I was up all night
going over my options.

12:25.395 --> 12:27.863
The only option I see here
is to retire the horse.

12:27.931 --> 12:29.865
Yeah, but I can't make
a living without him.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.301
You know how expensive
that surgery is.

12:32.368 --> 12:35.437
Yeah, I'm gonna have to find
a way to pay for it.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.139
So you're gonna
do it then?

12:37.207 --> 12:38.207
Yeah.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.379
You do realize that the effects
don't last forever.

12:44.447 --> 12:45.780
He's gonna feel
the pain again,

12:45.849 --> 12:47.882
and you'll have to put him
through another surgery,

12:47.950 --> 12:49.217
and you know the risks
that are involved

12:49.284 --> 12:50.718
when you put a horse under.

12:50.785 --> 12:52.519
What, so I should
quit jumping?

12:52.587 --> 12:54.555
Come on, Amy.

12:54.622 --> 12:56.590
I was hoping, of all people,
you would understand.

12:56.658 --> 12:59.991
No, I think you were hoping
that I would agree with you,

13:00.162 --> 13:01.595
but you know it's wrong.

13:01.663 --> 13:03.096
I gotta go.

13:17.778 --> 13:19.258
What's up with you?

13:26.052 --> 13:27.786
What?

13:27.854 --> 13:30.155
Phoenix!
You get back here!

13:34.427 --> 13:36.827
All right.
Come on, let's go.

13:38.063 --> 13:40.064
Okay,
don't be a show-off.

13:44.636 --> 13:46.804
Hmm.

13:53.685 --> 13:55.785
What in the
heck's going on here?

13:55.852 --> 13:58.086
I know what you're gonna say...

13:58.154 --> 13:59.722
It'll never work.

13:59.790 --> 14:01.524
Well, first,
what is it?

14:01.591 --> 14:02.525
It's a chuckwagon.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.992
Oh...

14:04.060 --> 14:05.961
Well, it won't work.

14:06.029 --> 14:07.229
Thought number one:

14:07.297 --> 14:09.097
You might wanna replace
those sticks

14:09.165 --> 14:11.033
with something
a little straighter.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.068
Some fence rails maybe.

14:13.136 --> 14:16.271
Even then, you couldn't really
hook it up to a harness.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.140
Well, Caleb said
I could clip the shafts

14:18.208 --> 14:19.807
to one of the horses'
saddles.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.442
- Oh he did, did he?
- Yeah.

14:21.509 --> 14:22.676
What horse?

14:22.744 --> 14:24.145
Phoenix.

14:24.213 --> 14:25.146
There's no way
you're taking that

14:25.214 --> 14:26.948
anywhere near Phoenix.

14:28.050 --> 14:29.930
That's what Caleb said,
but I know he can do it.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.785
No, he can't.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.054
So if you wanna a ride
in that thing,

14:33.121 --> 14:35.788
you better find a different
source of power.

14:35.857 --> 14:38.091
One of the other horses?

14:39.126 --> 14:41.928
No, I have
a different idea.

14:52.672 --> 14:54.206
Ugh...

14:54.274 --> 14:56.976
Okay, this is not
in my job description.

14:57.043 --> 14:58.244
You're the one
who filled her head

14:58.311 --> 15:00.779
with this stupid idea
in the first place.

15:00.847 --> 15:02.007
She's the one
that came to me.

15:02.048 --> 15:04.449
<i>Okay, stop now.</i>

15:04.517 --> 15:06.118
It held together,
so...

15:06.186 --> 15:07.986
Can I hook it up
to Phoenix now?

15:08.053 --> 15:11.289
Sorry, but you've got
an error in the design.

15:11.357 --> 15:14.690
See, Caleb was pulling
with the rails at his hips,

15:15.127 --> 15:17.561
and the horse's saddle
is a lot higher than that.

15:17.629 --> 15:18.897
You see what happens here?

15:18.964 --> 15:20.831
Whoa!

15:20.900 --> 15:23.967
See? You go flying
right out the back.

15:24.035 --> 15:25.335
Sorry, Georgie.

15:30.541 --> 15:31.541
There has got to be a way

15:31.575 --> 15:33.510
to make it work
with the horse.

15:33.577 --> 15:35.245
Just leave it alone,
Georgie.

15:35.313 --> 15:37.214
We need that cart
for the barn anyway,

15:37.282 --> 15:40.283
so just put it back
the way it was, please.

15:40.350 --> 15:41.784
Come on!

15:43.987 --> 15:46.022
Oh my goodness!
Look at you.

15:46.089 --> 15:48.424
What a pretty dress!
Come and see me!

15:48.491 --> 15:50.692
Yeah.
It's for the baby shower.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.395
You know
I'm still not going.

15:52.462 --> 15:53.595
No, I know.

15:53.663 --> 15:55.596
You have made that
perfectly clear.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.997
But I don't think you realize
how much fun it's gonna be.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.403
Right, Grandpa?

16:01.470 --> 16:03.305
Baby showers?
You bet.

16:03.372 --> 16:04.705
They're something else.

16:04.773 --> 16:05.974
Mm-hmm.

16:06.042 --> 16:08.709
Yeah, and I bet
you've never been to one.

16:08.777 --> 16:10.478
There's gonna be games.

16:10.546 --> 16:12.413
Yup. A whole
bunch of fun games.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.115
Probably some
fruit n' soda punch,

16:15.183 --> 16:17.617
and those sandwiches
that have the crusts cut off.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.220
You just made it sound
even more lame.

16:20.288 --> 16:22.389
Well, I have something

16:22.457 --> 16:24.058
that just might change
your mind.

16:28.828 --> 16:30.063
Ta-da!

16:30.998 --> 16:32.598
Is that for me?

16:33.567 --> 16:36.900
Because there is no way
I'm wearing that.

16:37.838 --> 16:38.938
<i>Come on, Georgie.</i>

16:39.006 --> 16:41.040
Look how cute it is.

16:41.108 --> 16:42.475
I don't do cute.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.615
It's okay.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.219
I don't know
about this.

16:54.287 --> 16:55.988
Oh, Amy left.
She'll never find out.

16:56.055 --> 16:57.655
She'd kill me
if she did.

16:57.723 --> 16:59.357
I mean, even she hasn't
gotten on that horse.

16:59.424 --> 17:01.158
Georgie's the only one.

17:01.226 --> 17:02.726
What,
that little girl?

17:02.794 --> 17:05.695
Yeah, she's got this
crazy bond with him.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.897
Trust me, if he'll jump
for some kid,

17:07.965 --> 17:10.334
I'll make him jump
for me.

17:11.303 --> 17:12.569
Oh, you know what?
This isn't fair.

17:12.637 --> 17:15.005
I don't wanna put you
in this position.

17:15.071 --> 17:16.506
I really do
wanna help you.

17:16.573 --> 17:19.242
No, no, no.
I got carried away.

17:19.310 --> 17:20.510
It's just that...

17:20.577 --> 17:22.012
When I saw him
jump over the fence,

17:22.079 --> 17:24.013
I thought it'd be a way
outta this, you know,

17:24.080 --> 17:25.882
for Buckingham.

17:25.949 --> 17:26.883
But I can't ask you
to put yourself

17:26.950 --> 17:28.951
on the line for me.

17:30.254 --> 17:31.753
I wanna help.

17:31.821 --> 17:33.722
Just wait here
and I'll get Phoenix.

17:33.789 --> 17:34.856
Yeah?

17:40.096 --> 17:41.096
I can't believe
he's going through

17:41.164 --> 17:42.464
with the de-nerving.

17:43.466 --> 17:45.200
Well,
it's Jeremy's decision.

17:45.268 --> 17:46.701
Who knows,
it might actually work.

17:46.769 --> 17:48.302
He might get a couple more years
jumping out of him.

17:48.370 --> 17:50.871
You sound like
Cassandra.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.873
What do you have
against her?

17:52.941 --> 17:56.274
Well, she knows just enough
to be dangerous.

17:56.611 --> 17:58.679
And what's that
supposed to mean?

17:58.747 --> 18:00.281
All her opinions
about horses

18:00.349 --> 18:02.983
come straight from
a textbook is all.

18:03.051 --> 18:05.618
Oh. So vet school's
a sham?

18:05.686 --> 18:07.087
No!
I didn't say that.

18:07.155 --> 18:10.090
I just think
she's a know-it-all.

18:10.158 --> 18:12.092
Okay, Amy,

18:12.160 --> 18:14.394
I think you and Cassandra
got off on the wrong foot.

18:14.462 --> 18:15.783
Why don't you come
to the barbecue

18:15.829 --> 18:17.190
and you can hang out
with Cassandra

18:17.198 --> 18:19.532
and see that she's not
such a bad person, okay?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.067
Thank you, again,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.102
but I think I have more fun
at your trailer

18:23.170 --> 18:24.403
when it's just
you and me.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.040
Come on! Hee-yah!

18:30.477 --> 18:31.510
Let's go!

18:32.812 --> 18:35.047
Jeremy!
What're you doing?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.748
I'm just showing him
who's boss.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.385
Come on, let's go!

18:40.453 --> 18:42.753
Maybe you should get off
before you hurt yourself.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.055
No, we're fine.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.624
We're just getting
to know each other.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.758
See?

18:49.261 --> 18:51.095
Nothin' to it.

18:53.664 --> 18:54.731
All right,

18:54.799 --> 18:56.233
let's see
what this bad boy can do.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.469
Hee-ya!

19:04.627 --> 19:05.793
Uh-oh!

19:05.861 --> 19:07.661
I always knew Ashley
was in a mood

19:07.729 --> 19:09.896
when the meat mallet out.

19:09.964 --> 19:12.165
Can you believe
I bought her a dress?

19:12.233 --> 19:14.268
I'm such an idiot!

19:14.335 --> 19:15.636
I don't know
what you're talking about!

19:15.703 --> 19:17.771
Maybe I'm just terrible
with kids.

19:17.838 --> 19:20.006
Come on now,
you're an awesome mom.

19:20.074 --> 19:21.608
Yeah, with a toddler.

19:21.676 --> 19:22.908
All I have to do
is tickle her tummy

19:22.976 --> 19:24.943
and do my Scruffy McDog voice.

19:25.011 --> 19:27.179
Well, that sounds cool.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.048
Can I hear it?

19:31.385 --> 19:33.085
Look, my point is...

19:33.153 --> 19:35.454
I don't know what I'm doing
with an 11-year-old girl,

19:35.522 --> 19:37.390
you know,
much less a tomboy.

19:37.457 --> 19:38.423
How am I supposed
to raise a kid

19:38.491 --> 19:40.492
I have nothing
in common with?

19:40.559 --> 19:41.793
Well,
from what I understand,

19:41.860 --> 19:44.195
you and your mom
were very different.

19:44.263 --> 19:45.863
Yeah...

19:45.931 --> 19:48.032
Yeah, we were
really different.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.433
And you seem to have
gotten along just fine.

19:52.672 --> 19:53.938
You know, sometimes
you're full of surprises,

19:54.006 --> 19:55.773
Caleb Odell.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.675
Yes, I am.

20:12.690 --> 20:14.290
All right!

20:14.358 --> 20:16.693
Oh no! We should get him
in the barn.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.428
No, no.
I want Amy to see this.

20:18.495 --> 20:20.062
Trust me, you don't.
She'll kill us.

20:20.130 --> 20:21.063
Come on! Come on!

20:21.131 --> 20:22.264
Please, Jeremy!

20:22.333 --> 20:23.533
Jeremy, don't!

20:23.600 --> 20:24.634
Hee-yah!

20:27.837 --> 20:28.870
Whoa!

20:28.938 --> 20:30.905
<i>Hey! Jeremy!</i>

20:30.973 --> 20:33.342
Jeremy,
get off that horse!

20:33.409 --> 20:36.110
Whew!
This horse has some spirit.

20:40.123 --> 20:41.957
<i>I'm sorry, Amy.</i>

20:42.025 --> 20:43.425
What were you trying
to prove, hm?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.993
That we could be
the perfect fit.

20:45.061 --> 20:46.929
What're you
talking about?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.436
I saw him jump
right out of that pen.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.898
It was incredible.

20:49.966 --> 20:51.466
Yeah, well, he didn't have
a rider on him, did he?

20:51.534 --> 20:53.135
Well, Mallory told me that
little girl can jump him.

20:53.203 --> 20:54.268
Georgie? Yeah.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.536
She's the only one
who can.

20:55.603 --> 20:56.603
Come on, if some little girl
can do it,

20:56.671 --> 20:58.706
imagine what I could do.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.007
Wait a second.
Are you...

21:00.075 --> 21:02.043
Are you asking me
to give you Phoenix?

21:02.110 --> 21:03.978
Just for the rest
of the season.

21:04.046 --> 21:05.379
And why would I do that?

21:05.447 --> 21:06.447
'Cause if you do,

21:06.514 --> 21:08.449
I'll cancel
Buckingham's surgery

21:08.516 --> 21:10.717
and retire him
just like you said I should.

21:10.784 --> 21:13.253
Sound like
a good trade?

21:18.525 --> 21:19.926
And I didn't
know what to say.

21:19.994 --> 21:21.094
I mean, he just came out
and asked

21:21.162 --> 21:22.329
if he could have Phoenix.

21:22.396 --> 21:23.830
Well, that's pretty bold,
isn't it?

21:23.898 --> 21:25.332
He's desperate.

21:25.399 --> 21:26.598
He knows he has to put
his horse through surgery,

21:26.666 --> 21:28.000
and this way
he wouldn't have to.

21:28.068 --> 21:29.768
Wait a minute here.

21:29.836 --> 21:32.204
Are you actually
considering this?

21:32.272 --> 21:33.339
I don't know.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.540
What about Georgie?

21:35.608 --> 21:37.376
She's the only thing
that's holding me back.

21:37.443 --> 21:39.144
I mean, she would be
heartbroken.

21:39.212 --> 21:41.446
That's an understatement.

21:41.514 --> 21:43.814
So what should I do?

21:43.883 --> 21:47.216
No matter which way you go
someone's gonna get hurt.

21:47.887 --> 21:49.248
Personally,
it feels like we've had

21:49.255 --> 21:51.655
our fair share of hurt
around here lately.

21:56.095 --> 21:58.795
I am finally
finished my blog post!

21:58.863 --> 22:00.264
<i>That should get my sponsor</i>
<i>off my back,</i>

22:00.331 --> 22:01.452
<i>at least for a little while.</i>

22:01.465 --> 22:03.033
That's great.

22:03.101 --> 22:06.203
You could at least fake
some enthusiasm.

22:06.271 --> 22:07.437
I'm sorry.
I just...

22:08.439 --> 22:09.672
I was hoping Grandpa

22:09.740 --> 22:10.640
would give me some advice
on something,

22:10.708 --> 22:13.010
but instead
he made it tougher.

22:13.077 --> 22:14.277
Well, he's got a lot
on his mind.

22:14.344 --> 22:15.912
You know,
he's not saying anything,

22:15.979 --> 22:18.881
but I think he's really upset
about this whole Lisa thing.

22:18.949 --> 22:21.750
Do you really think
it's over between them?

22:21.818 --> 22:24.287
I think they're from two
very different worlds

22:24.354 --> 22:26.055
and it's finally catching up
to them.

22:27.891 --> 22:30.258
I really hope that never happens
with me and Ty.

22:30.326 --> 22:31.826
Whoa!
Where's that coming from?

22:33.662 --> 22:35.330
I know it's only been two weeks
since he's been in vet school,

22:35.398 --> 22:37.999
but already I feel like
there's this whole other world

22:38.067 --> 22:39.935
that I'm not a part of.

22:40.002 --> 22:41.903
Well, I think
that's healthy.

22:41.971 --> 22:43.905
As long as he's not like
shutting you out or something.

22:43.973 --> 22:46.673
No, no,
of course not.

22:46.741 --> 22:47.674
He even invited me
to hang out

22:47.742 --> 22:49.443
with his vet school friends.

22:49.510 --> 22:50.777
Sounds like
a good opportunity

22:50.845 --> 22:54.081
to get a glimpse
into his new world.

22:54.149 --> 22:55.215
Yeah, you're right.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.718
Can I ask you something?

22:58.786 --> 22:59.920
Amy, I told you,

22:59.988 --> 23:01.428
it's totally cool
that you're coming.

23:01.489 --> 23:03.856
No!
No, um...

23:03.924 --> 23:05.891
What's with the shirt?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.526
We got these
for orientation week.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.262
Every class has
their own name.

23:09.330 --> 23:10.496
I've got an extra one
if you want it.

23:10.564 --> 23:11.564
No, it's quite
all right.

23:12.866 --> 23:13.967
<i>Hey, Mal.</i>

23:14.034 --> 23:15.501
So you're talking
to me again?

23:15.569 --> 23:17.870
I don't know why.
You went behind my back.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.604
I did it for Buckingham.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.073
Oh please...

23:21.140 --> 23:22.707
Okay, okay.
What's going on here?

23:22.775 --> 23:24.943
Well, Jeremy wants
to jump Phoenix

23:25.011 --> 23:26.478
for the rest
of the season.

23:26.545 --> 23:29.314
So he can retire Buckingham.

23:29.382 --> 23:30.715
He wants to use
his own horse

23:30.783 --> 23:33.185
as leverage
to get to Phoenix?

23:33.252 --> 23:34.185
What a piece of work.

23:34.252 --> 23:35.652
That's not true, Ty.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.054
You don't know him
like I do.

23:37.122 --> 23:38.856
Okay, can we not talk
about Jeremy anymore?

23:38.923 --> 23:40.091
You're right.

23:40.158 --> 23:41.118
You can keep the change.

23:41.159 --> 23:42.893
We got a barbecue
to go to.

23:42.961 --> 23:46.097
You're gonna love
these guys.

23:47.065 --> 23:48.585
<i>You should've
seen your face</i>

23:48.600 --> 23:50.766
<i>when the foam started</i>
<i>coming outta your nose.</i>

23:50.834 --> 23:52.302
I'm sorry.

23:52.370 --> 23:53.803
I've never drank beer out of
a latex arm sleeve before.

23:55.306 --> 23:56.072
Well, did you tell her
about the slip and slide

23:56.140 --> 23:57.807
we set up at the kegger?

23:57.875 --> 23:59.309
Oh yeah! Amy.

23:59.377 --> 24:00.477
Nicole that was your idea,
right?

24:00.544 --> 24:01.844
Okay...

24:01.912 --> 24:03.380
We used a plastic tarp

24:03.447 --> 24:05.548
greased with
animal reproduction lube.

24:05.616 --> 24:06.648
Oh, lovely.

24:08.151 --> 24:09.151
Classic!

24:11.087 --> 24:12.454
Orientation week was crazy,
Amy,

24:12.522 --> 24:13.922
I wish you could've
been there.

24:13.990 --> 24:16.658
Yeah,
feels like I was.

24:16.726 --> 24:18.760
<i>Well, have fun while
you can 'cause I'm telling you,</i>

24:18.828 --> 24:20.989
you take all the hours you study
for your other courses

24:21.031 --> 24:22.296
and double it.

24:22.364 --> 24:24.132
That's what you gonna need
for anatomy.

24:24.199 --> 24:25.733
There aren't enough hours
in a day for that.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.369
Sure there are,
if you want to pass.

24:28.437 --> 24:30.538
So basically
you have no life.

24:30.605 --> 24:32.606
Well, no,
it's about choices.

24:32.674 --> 24:34.035
You split your life up
into school,

24:34.043 --> 24:36.644
sleep and your relationship.

24:36.711 --> 24:38.645
Now decide which one of those
you're gonna really suck at

24:38.712 --> 24:40.447
for the next 4 years.

24:47.688 --> 24:48.721
Finally.

24:48.789 --> 24:50.557
I thought my date
stood me up.

25:03.537 --> 25:06.870
Hey, I wanna talk to you
about something.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.675
Uh oh! You've got that tone
in your voice.

25:10.742 --> 25:11.943
Is this about
the chuckwagon?

25:12.010 --> 25:14.279
No. It's about Lou.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.114
I want you to cut her
some slack

25:16.182 --> 25:17.582
'cause she's trying
real hard.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.650
Yeah! She's trying
really hard

25:19.718 --> 25:22.019
<i>to turn me into</i>
<i>some "girly girl."</i>

25:22.088 --> 25:23.754
<i>No she's not.</i>

25:23.822 --> 25:25.190
I'm sorry,

25:25.257 --> 25:28.590
but that's how
she makes me feel sometimes.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.601
Well, this is awkward.

25:36.668 --> 25:39.503
So, um,
please tell me,

25:39.571 --> 25:41.138
are you dating
Cassandra?

25:41.206 --> 25:42.406
No, we're not dating.

25:43.273 --> 25:46.409
She told me to come
to her friend's barbecue

25:46.477 --> 25:48.544
and it turned out
to be Ty's.

25:48.613 --> 25:50.080
Oh. Do you want
more vodka?

25:50.147 --> 25:53.449
Yeah...
And don't be stingy.

25:53.517 --> 25:54.851
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:54.919 --> 25:55.986
Thanks.

25:57.187 --> 25:58.354
Uh, you're not
having any?

25:58.422 --> 26:00.723
No, I don't drink.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.224
Oh.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.391
All right,
at least wait with me

26:03.459 --> 26:04.392
while I finish mine.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.420
I need to steel
my nerves

26:05.461 --> 26:07.162
before I go back
over there.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.563
Okay. I guess I could use
a few moments away too.

26:10.834 --> 26:13.301
Do you have any um...
Clean ice?

26:13.369 --> 26:16.004
Oh, sure.
I'll grab some.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.882
I overheard your
conversation with Georgie.

26:27.950 --> 26:29.483
Yeah.

26:29.551 --> 26:32.585
Well, there's been some
big changes around here.

26:32.654 --> 26:34.015
It's gonna take awhile
for everyone

26:34.022 --> 26:36.023
to get their bearings back,
I think.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.158
Are you talking about
the Georgie situation,

26:38.225 --> 26:40.127
the Lisa situation,

26:40.194 --> 26:43.296
or the house burning down
situation?

26:43.364 --> 26:45.198
All of it,
I guess.

26:45.266 --> 26:48.599
I just wish I had a clue
where to start with that girl.

26:49.102 --> 26:50.803
Bike wheels.

26:50.871 --> 26:52.237
Pardon me?

26:52.305 --> 26:55.474
Her wagon has a design flaw
and that's the solution.

26:55.542 --> 26:56.809
Bicycle tires?

26:56.877 --> 26:58.844
Yep. Just gotta find
decent-sized ones.

26:58.912 --> 27:00.146
My cruiser.

27:00.213 --> 27:01.693
Well, don't go ruining
your good bike.

27:01.748 --> 27:03.915
I haven't ridden that thing
in ages.

27:03.983 --> 27:05.143
Would you help me
put them on?

27:05.151 --> 27:06.217
No, no.

27:06.285 --> 27:07.686
Better if you do it.

27:07.753 --> 27:09.154
But please,

27:09.221 --> 27:12.554
do not let her hitch
that thing up to Phoenix.

27:13.793 --> 27:15.827
Uh, yeah.

27:18.330 --> 27:19.691
You want some more
cranberry juice?

27:19.698 --> 27:21.464
Yeah, sure.

27:21.532 --> 27:22.966
But, you know, we should
probably get back out there.

27:23.034 --> 27:26.036
Meh. Doesn't sound
like they miss us.

27:26.104 --> 27:27.204
Well, I just don't want
Ty to think

27:27.271 --> 27:29.306
I'm avoiding
his new friends.

27:29.373 --> 27:30.874
I mean,
who could blame you?

27:30.942 --> 27:32.843
Look at those shirts.

27:32.911 --> 27:34.911
Yeah.

27:34.978 --> 27:37.013
They are pretty bad,
aren't they?

27:37.081 --> 27:38.314
Well, now I totally
get that saying,

27:38.381 --> 27:39.749
"too school for cool".

27:41.284 --> 27:42.685
Here, I'll go top up
the ice.

27:42.753 --> 27:43.753
Great.

27:55.564 --> 27:58.233
All right.
Here you go.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.400
Thanks.

28:00.536 --> 28:02.604
So... Phoenix.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.374
I am impressed that
you waited this long

28:06.442 --> 28:08.508
to bring that up.

28:08.576 --> 28:11.909
Well, don't you think
we look great together?

28:12.214 --> 28:13.614
Well,
I think you would.

28:13.681 --> 28:16.984
But Phoenix
is Georgie's horse,

28:17.052 --> 28:18.886
and he is more
than a jumper to her.

28:18.954 --> 28:21.922
So I'd have to really
think about it.

28:21.990 --> 28:24.690
I mean, I'm sorry,
but...

28:24.759 --> 28:26.059
I need an answer
really soon.

28:26.127 --> 28:27.293
Just 'cause Scott,

28:27.361 --> 28:29.295
he has an opening for surgery
this week.

28:29.363 --> 28:31.697
So I booked him in.

28:31.766 --> 28:33.266
You booked him in?

28:33.333 --> 28:36.302
Yeah, I mean,
I had to do it.

28:38.105 --> 28:39.604
I mean, maybe I can talk
to Georgie,

28:39.672 --> 28:41.774
and see if I could
make this right.

28:41.841 --> 28:43.208
No, believe me,

28:43.276 --> 28:44.542
there is nothing that
you could say to Georgie

28:44.610 --> 28:46.979
that would make
this right.

28:47.046 --> 28:48.647
But...

28:48.714 --> 28:52.047
Maybe I could try
and explain it to her.

28:52.518 --> 28:54.619
So you'll give me
Phoenix?

28:54.687 --> 28:57.188
I just can't let you put
Buckingham through this.

28:57.256 --> 28:59.690
There's too many risks.

28:59.758 --> 29:01.259
I don't know how
to thank you.

29:01.326 --> 29:03.828
Hmm.
Don't thank me.

29:03.896 --> 29:05.229
We should get back
over there.

29:18.242 --> 29:20.010
So I guess he told you

29:20.077 --> 29:22.445
<i>he booked</i>
<i>the de-nerving procedure.</i>

29:22.513 --> 29:23.713
You have?

29:23.781 --> 29:25.816
Well, actually...

29:25.883 --> 29:28.350
That's for dealing
with navicular disease, right?

29:28.418 --> 29:30.886
Yeah. It's where they sever
the posterior digital nerve

29:30.954 --> 29:32.788
to block out the pain
of the condition.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.924
And it actually works?

29:34.991 --> 29:36.892
Well, they say in
about 70 percent of horses

29:36.960 --> 29:38.227
who've had the treatment

29:38.295 --> 29:40.129
<i>have been sound</i>
<i>for at least a year,</i>

29:40.197 --> 29:42.331
<i>so there's good reason</i>
<i>to be confident.</i>

29:42.398 --> 29:44.598
Mm-hm. Yeah.

29:46.735 --> 29:49.003
Uh, I'm sorry,
is something funny?

29:49.071 --> 29:52.006
Oh. No, no. I'm
just wondering um...

29:52.074 --> 29:54.976
I'm just wondering how confident
he's gonna be

29:55.044 --> 29:58.377
riding a horse that has
no feeling in his hoof?

29:59.113 --> 30:00.080
<i>Does anybody
need another drink-</i>

30:00.148 --> 30:02.149
No, no, no, seriously.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.885
I mean, you can talk about
all these percentages

30:04.953 --> 30:06.185
and all these probabilities,

30:06.253 --> 30:07.987
and all this clinical
blah blah blah,

30:08.055 --> 30:09.956
but really,
you have no clue

30:10.023 --> 30:11.724
<i>because you have never</i>
<i>galloped a horse</i>

30:11.791 --> 30:13.259
<i>towards a meter forty oxer</i>

30:13.327 --> 30:16.660
who doesn't have any feeling
in his feet, have you?

30:17.130 --> 30:19.531
No, you've probably never even
ridden a horse before.

30:23.469 --> 30:25.503
...she hasn't.

30:32.845 --> 30:34.112
<i> Quiet.</i>

30:34.180 --> 30:35.313
<i>Get inside.</i>

30:35.381 --> 30:37.349
I said I'm sorry.

30:37.416 --> 30:38.749
You know,
how would I know

30:38.816 --> 30:40.751
that she'd never actually ridden
a horse before.

30:40.818 --> 30:43.020
- Shhh! Keep it down, okay?
- What?!

30:43.088 --> 30:44.288
Why are you acting like this?

30:44.356 --> 30:45.455
You've never been like this
before.

30:45.523 --> 30:46.891
- What's going on?
- I know!

30:46.958 --> 30:49.293
I don't know,
but I wanna do this.

30:50.795 --> 30:51.929
Hey, your breath
smells like booze.

30:51.997 --> 30:53.197
You don't drink.

30:53.265 --> 30:55.231
No. No, I don't.

30:55.299 --> 30:58.134
- Amy, come on.
- But I do wanna dance.

30:58.202 --> 30:59.763
Amy, come on! This
isn't funny, okay?

30:59.770 --> 31:01.170
I think it's this new shirt.

31:01.238 --> 31:02.738
You know, this shirt looks
so good on you.

31:02.806 --> 31:04.473
Amy. Amy!

31:04.541 --> 31:06.142
It's kinda tight.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.977
You're gonna wake Jack up.
Be quiet.

31:08.045 --> 31:10.078
You worry too much.

31:12.148 --> 31:13.181
Oh.

31:16.052 --> 31:17.819
Jack! Um, we were just-

31:18.788 --> 31:21.890
Yeah, I can see
what you're doing.

31:24.027 --> 31:26.727
Okay. Well, I should
probably get going, Amy.

31:26.795 --> 31:28.629
Good idea.

31:28.696 --> 31:31.399
- Good night, okay?
- Good night.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.864
What're you doing?

31:55.932 --> 31:58.532
I thought these might
keep your wagon from dragging.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.600
You put those on?

31:59.634 --> 32:00.802
Uh-huh.

32:00.869 --> 32:02.269
By yourself?

32:02.337 --> 32:03.705
Yes.

32:03.772 --> 32:04.939
Now what do you say?

32:05.007 --> 32:06.674
You wanna take it
for a spin?

32:06.742 --> 32:08.275
Really?
On Phoenix?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.144
I have a way better idea.

32:10.212 --> 32:12.180
Well, it better not be Caleb.

32:24.225 --> 32:25.692
Hi there.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.493
Hey.

32:27.561 --> 32:30.196
Well, about last night...

32:30.263 --> 32:33.165
How about I promise
it won't happen again

32:33.233 --> 32:36.168
and we just leave it
at that?

32:38.872 --> 32:40.039
Grandpa?

32:40.107 --> 32:41.173
Yeah.

32:42.342 --> 32:44.476
I've made a decision
about Phoenix.

32:44.544 --> 32:45.610
Oh?

32:47.379 --> 32:50.314
This was really
tough for me.

32:50.382 --> 32:52.117
You know, I...

32:52.184 --> 32:53.284
I know how much Georgie

32:53.352 --> 32:54.285
and that horse
have been through

32:54.353 --> 32:57.655
since she got here.

32:57.723 --> 33:00.258
But I can find her
another horse.

33:01.492 --> 33:03.127
I'm real sorry.

33:04.262 --> 33:07.595
It's not my feelings you need
to be concerned about, is it?

33:10.969 --> 33:12.836
I will talk to her.

33:12.904 --> 33:15.438
Amy...

33:15.506 --> 33:18.174
I've always respected
your dedication

33:18.242 --> 33:19.909
to the well being
of a horse,

33:19.977 --> 33:23.112
but you cannot save
every one.

33:23.180 --> 33:25.248
<i>And sometimes...</i>

33:25.315 --> 33:26.816
<i>Well, you know what they say.</i>

33:26.884 --> 33:29.986
Sometimes family needs
to come first.

33:42.765 --> 33:44.399
<i>There. The wheels have
raised it up high enough.</i>

33:44.466 --> 33:46.101
So hop in, Georgie.

33:49.370 --> 33:51.105
What's the matter?

33:52.307 --> 33:54.675
Are you sure those wheels
aren't gonna come flying off?

33:54.742 --> 33:57.845
Honey, I put them on myself.
I told you.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.593
Yeah, but
building stuff like this

33:59.614 --> 34:01.481
isn't really your thing,
right?

34:01.549 --> 34:03.050
If Lou says the wheels
are on good n' tight,

34:03.118 --> 34:05.185
then you can be darn sure
they are.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.286
Jump in.

34:12.293 --> 34:13.893
And you...
Be careful.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.761
You're driving.

34:16.864 --> 34:18.264
All right.

34:19.466 --> 34:20.966
Let's do this.

34:24.337 --> 34:27.239
Agggghhhhh! Yeah!

34:28.875 --> 34:29.875
Woo-hoooo!

34:33.213 --> 34:34.279
Woo-hoo!

34:39.184 --> 34:41.518
That's awesome, guys!

34:43.420 --> 34:44.420
Yeah!

34:45.757 --> 34:47.558
It worked!
It really worked.

34:47.625 --> 34:48.692
Any time you want to go
for a ride,

34:48.760 --> 34:50.793
we'll bring out the ATV,
okay?

34:50.862 --> 34:52.263
What about Phoenix?

34:52.331 --> 34:54.429
Honey, we're not hooking this up
to him, all right?

34:54.498 --> 34:55.665
Okay.

34:55.733 --> 34:58.434
All right.
Let's go take this off.

35:06.460 --> 35:09.793
Hey, Borden!
It's that time of the month.

35:10.664 --> 35:11.897
Ye-ah!

35:11.965 --> 35:13.666
You know how to make
a landlord happy.

35:13.734 --> 35:15.768
I thought you were
coming by earlier?

35:15.836 --> 35:17.069
Yeah, I was,

35:17.137 --> 35:18.938
but I had to help Lou
with something.

35:19.006 --> 35:20.139
You know,
I really feel

35:20.206 --> 35:21.874
for what she's going through
right now.

35:21.942 --> 35:23.142
Yeah.

35:23.209 --> 35:25.043
She's got a lot
on her plate -

35:25.111 --> 35:26.711
the fire,
and now Georgie.

35:26.779 --> 35:29.180
And a husband
that doesn't get it.

35:29.248 --> 35:31.516
That was kinda harsh.

35:31.583 --> 35:33.551
<i>Everybody has their up's</i>
<i>and their down's, right?</i>

35:33.619 --> 35:34.418
Peter's a good guy
though.

35:34.486 --> 35:35.854
Yeah, well,

35:35.921 --> 35:37.122
why doesn't he treat
a woman like Lou

35:37.189 --> 35:40.025
the way she deserves
to be treated?

35:40.092 --> 35:41.591
"A woman like Lou?"

35:41.660 --> 35:43.360
Yeah. You know,
like...

35:43.427 --> 35:45.462
Caring and smart,

35:45.530 --> 35:48.498
and not exactly hard
on the eyes.

35:48.566 --> 35:50.167
You're not thinking of...?

35:50.234 --> 35:52.335
No, I don't have feelings
for Lou.

35:52.403 --> 35:53.770
Okay, well...

35:53.837 --> 35:55.372
I'm just saying Peter doesn't
know how good he has it

35:55.439 --> 35:56.473
and he needs to treat her

35:56.541 --> 35:59.874
the way she deserves
to be treated.

36:01.345 --> 36:03.480
Okay, uh...

36:03.548 --> 36:05.214
All those things
you just said,

36:05.282 --> 36:08.615
I think you should...
Keep them to yourself.

36:10.453 --> 36:13.786
I just see things
the way I see 'em.

36:19.529 --> 36:21.396
Georgie,

36:22.565 --> 36:24.365
I wanna talk to you
about something.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.167
I'm sorry.
I know no one wants me

36:26.235 --> 36:27.935
to hook this up
to Phoenix, but-

36:28.003 --> 36:30.205
wait, is that what
you're doing back here?

36:30.272 --> 36:31.339
No. You're never gonna
get anywhere near him

36:31.407 --> 36:32.740
with this thing.

36:32.808 --> 36:34.875
Maybe he was trained
for something like this before.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.043
He'll pull me in it,
I know he will.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.612
I'll call him in
and show you.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.480
What do you mean,
"you'll call him in"?

36:40.548 --> 36:42.216
You know, when it's time
to give him his feed.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.650
No, I don't know.

36:43.718 --> 36:45.051
What're you talking
about?

36:45.119 --> 36:46.786
Phoenix!

36:47.722 --> 36:49.022
<i>Here, boy!</i>

36:57.163 --> 36:58.864
Wow.

36:58.932 --> 37:00.700
What? Don't all horses
do that?

37:02.369 --> 37:05.671
No they don't.

37:07.608 --> 37:08.806
Hi...

37:12.645 --> 37:14.246
You really wanna
try this, do you?

37:33.265 --> 37:34.331
Look at them together.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.939
You were right,
Grandpa.

37:44.007 --> 37:45.508
I know.

37:56.948 --> 37:57.982
Hey.

37:59.183 --> 38:00.851
So have you talked
to the kid?

38:00.919 --> 38:02.486
Not yet.

38:02.554 --> 38:04.688
I really need to start
working with him soon,

38:04.756 --> 38:06.991
or else I'm not gonna
have any chance.

38:07.058 --> 38:09.959
Jeremy...
I've changed my mind.

38:10.961 --> 38:11.995
What?

38:12.062 --> 38:14.597
I can't take him away
from Georgie.

38:16.165 --> 38:17.466
We had a deal.

38:17.535 --> 38:20.537
You got me drunk,
didn't you?

38:22.305 --> 38:23.606
Right.

38:23.674 --> 38:26.474
So we don't have a deal.

38:26.543 --> 38:28.644
You can't do this.

38:28.711 --> 38:29.878
Phoenix is Georgie's horse,

38:29.946 --> 38:31.479
and somehow I lost sight
of that.

38:31.548 --> 38:33.415
You can't be serious.

38:33.482 --> 38:34.650
You're gonna waste
that horse's talent

38:34.717 --> 38:36.618
so he can be her pet?

38:36.686 --> 38:38.286
Are you nuts?

38:38.354 --> 38:40.688
I've made up my mind.

38:41.924 --> 38:43.485
So what're you gonna do
with Buckingham?

38:43.491 --> 38:46.193
No, you've lost any right
to ask about my horse.

38:46.261 --> 38:47.327
Okay?

38:55.070 --> 38:57.370
What was that about?

38:57.438 --> 39:00.574
I just told him that
I've decided to keep Phoenix.

39:00.641 --> 39:02.108
He told me
you guys had a deal.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.644
How can you just break
your promise?

39:11.151 --> 39:12.472
You wanna go
to your grandpa?

39:12.519 --> 39:16.852
Oh, she does look so adorable
in that dress.

39:17.123 --> 39:18.924
You know,
Peter should be home by now.

39:18.992 --> 39:20.926
Well, his flight
is probably delayed.

39:20.994 --> 39:22.628
But he would've sent me
a text message.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.463
He always texts me
right before take-off

39:24.530 --> 39:26.198
and after landing.

39:26.265 --> 39:27.399
I'm gonna give him
a call.

39:31.003 --> 39:32.283
I guess it doesn't look
as stupid

39:32.304 --> 39:34.105
as I thought it would.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.674
Georgie! Does this mean...?

39:36.742 --> 39:38.109
Yes, I'm coming.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.277
You look so-

39:40.345 --> 39:41.579
<i>Don't say it.</i>

39:41.647 --> 39:43.047
Don't say cute.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.815
Because if either of you
make a big deal out of this

39:44.882 --> 39:46.617
I won't wear it.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.551
I was gonna say
you look awesome.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.552
Can I take a picture?

39:49.621 --> 39:50.687
No.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.625
Oh! Look, Katie cat.
Daddy's home.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.660
Oh, I'll be right back.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.696
Hi, Katie.

40:02.432 --> 40:03.766
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:04.768 --> 40:06.102
Where were my texts?

40:06.169 --> 40:07.903
Oh, sorry. I was...

40:07.971 --> 40:09.491
I was on a call
right up until take-off

40:09.506 --> 40:12.474
and then back on the phone
as soon we landed, so...

40:12.542 --> 40:14.610
Oh, well, guess what?

40:14.678 --> 40:17.345
I had a couple of really big
breakthroughs with Georgie.

40:17.412 --> 40:18.479
No way.
What happened?

40:18.547 --> 40:19.648
Well, I'd love
to tell you about it

40:19.715 --> 40:21.516
but we gotta get
to this baby shower.

40:21.583 --> 40:22.517
She's going to that?

40:22.584 --> 40:23.785
- Yeah.
- Wow.

40:23.853 --> 40:25.286
Hey, I have a great idea.

40:25.354 --> 40:27.889
Why don't we all go out
for dinner tonight at Maggie's,

40:27.957 --> 40:29.157
as a family?

40:29.224 --> 40:31.259
I can't, honey.
I hate to say this,

40:31.326 --> 40:32.193
but im gonna be
on the phone

40:32.261 --> 40:33.527
all evening so...

40:33.594 --> 40:35.829
Honey, just this one time,
can't you just...

40:35.897 --> 40:37.197
Sorry.

40:37.265 --> 40:38.331
You know what?
Forget it.

40:38.399 --> 40:40.100
We'll just do dinner
without you.

40:40.168 --> 40:41.535
Don't do that!

40:41.602 --> 40:42.970
You do your
thing, we'll do ours.

40:43.038 --> 40:44.237
We're getting used to it.

40:44.305 --> 40:45.939
That's totally unfair, Lou!

40:46.007 --> 40:47.808
Are you serious?

40:48.742 --> 40:49.676
What?

40:49.743 --> 40:50.864
You think
she's being unfair?

40:53.380 --> 40:55.081
I'm sorry, I don't see how this
is any of your business,

40:55.149 --> 40:56.348
so please.

40:56.416 --> 40:58.184
I suppose that's true,
but...

40:58.251 --> 40:59.251
It's gettin' harder
and harder to ignore

40:59.319 --> 41:02.121
the way you treat her.

41:02.189 --> 41:04.523
Excuse me?

41:04.591 --> 41:06.058
What's your deal,
man?

41:06.125 --> 41:07.092
You might be
the only oil guy

41:07.160 --> 41:09.527
who can't get a job
in Alberta.

41:09.595 --> 41:10.762
Wow! That's great.

41:10.830 --> 41:12.363
So you're judging me
too now? You?

41:12.431 --> 41:15.400
Right. Because I'm supposed
to be a stupid cowboy?

41:15.467 --> 41:16.367
I wasn't gonna say it
out loud, pal,

41:16.435 --> 41:17.468
but you know.

41:19.205 --> 41:21.572
Caleb! What the
hell are you doing?!

41:23.208 --> 41:25.142
- Wow! What was that?!
- Stop this right now!

41:25.210 --> 41:26.643
He came at me,
Lou.

41:26.712 --> 41:28.432
- He had it coming.
- What're you talking about?

41:29.647 --> 41:31.048
Oh my God, Caleb.

41:31.116 --> 41:33.417
Just get outta here!
Get outta here!

41:34.419 --> 41:35.385
Are you okay?

41:35.453 --> 41:36.687
What was that?

41:36.754 --> 41:37.954
I don't know. I don't know.

41:37.955 --> 41:40.156
I'll talk to him later.
Come on.

41:40.224 --> 41:42.325
Come on,
let's go inside.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.729
Come on,
come on.

41:55.138 --> 41:56.171
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:57.473 --> 41:58.573
How're you feelin'?

41:58.641 --> 42:01.042
A little bit sluggish.

42:04.747 --> 42:06.547
So um...

42:07.649 --> 42:08.783
Were we so boring
last night

42:08.851 --> 42:12.120
that we drove you
to have your first drink?

42:12.187 --> 42:14.455
Jeremy slipped it
in my juice.

42:14.522 --> 42:15.489
He did what?

42:15.557 --> 42:16.590
Listen, Ty...

42:16.658 --> 42:18.191
He's gonna get it now!

42:18.259 --> 42:19.592
Ty, he only did it

42:19.660 --> 42:21.895
so he could get to Phoenix,
okay?

42:21.963 --> 42:23.163
Nothing happened,

42:23.231 --> 42:24.898
and I'd really,
really appreciate

42:24.966 --> 42:26.566
if we could just drop it.

42:26.634 --> 42:27.634
Okay?

42:30.138 --> 42:31.571
Did it work?

42:31.639 --> 42:34.972
No. Phoenix isn't going
anywhere.

42:37.811 --> 42:41.144
Hey, I'm sorry
if I embarassed you

42:41.347 --> 42:42.681
in front of
your new friends.

42:44.184 --> 42:46.551
No, you didn't embarrass me.

42:46.619 --> 42:48.587
I actually uh...

42:48.655 --> 42:51.756
I got text messages from Sean
and Nicole this morning.

42:51.824 --> 42:53.124
They where kind of glad

42:53.192 --> 42:54.793
<i>you knocked Cassandra</i>
<i>down a few pegs.</i>

42:54.860 --> 42:57.162
She was starting to grate
on their nerves as well.

42:59.899 --> 43:01.800
You know that stuff
that she said

43:01.867 --> 43:05.200
about choosing between sleep
or relationships?

43:05.736 --> 43:08.505
Do you think
any of that's true?

43:09.774 --> 43:11.675
I hope not.

43:11.742 --> 43:13.076
If so...

43:13.144 --> 43:15.879
I choose you over sleep
any day.

43:17.916 --> 43:19.382
Now come on,
I want a rematch.

43:19.450 --> 43:20.950
For what?

43:21.018 --> 43:22.084
I wanna see if you can
wrestle me down to that couch

43:22.152 --> 43:24.153
now that Jack's not around.
Ready?
