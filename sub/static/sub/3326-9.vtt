00:01.043 --> 00:02.169
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.378 --> 00:04.710
It's a dead pool.
A hit list of supernatural creatures.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.628
- What's the number?
- That's how much you're worth.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.172
I'm worth five dollars?

00:08.384 --> 00:10.340
- Five million.
- That's kind of terrifying.

00:10.553 --> 00:13.670
I don't think the Orphans were the only
professional killers in Beacon Hills.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.552
- Father and daughter.
- We need to tell her the truth.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.599
She's going to see
the rest of the dead pool eventually.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.935
Malia?

00:24.650 --> 00:26.641
We might know a lot more about
who The Benefactor is now.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.897
Who has the power to know
when someone is dead,

00:29.113 --> 00:31.354
but doesn't need to see
the body to know it happened?

00:31.574 --> 00:32.484
A Banshee.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.819
This was the last thing your grandmother
wrote down before she died.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.321
This isn't nonsense, Mom.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.203
It's code.

01:02.647 --> 01:03.602
Hey!

01:03.814 --> 01:05.475
Hey, what are you doing?

01:07.652 --> 01:09.188
Listen... Listen to me!

01:09.403 --> 01:11.815
I'm a Deputy with the Beacon Hills
Sheriff's Department...

01:12.031 --> 01:14.738
Damn.
I was hoping you'd be out longer.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.072
Haigh?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.443
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're a good guy, Parrish.

01:19.664 --> 01:21.404
But the list says
you're worth five million dollars.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.615
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.789
Haigh, listen...

01:25.002 --> 01:27.539
I mean,
I barely make $40,000 a year.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.459
| only make 36.

01:32.343 --> 01:35.176
No! Haigh, please! Just stop!

01:37.765 --> 01:40.006
You don't have to do this.
Look, it you're having money problems...

01:40.226 --> 01:42.217
You're worth five million dead, Parrish.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.892
Sounds like you got the problem.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.691
Please...

01:48.901 --> 01:50.311
Please, don't do this.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.772
You're just gonna stand there?

01:52.989 --> 01:55.401
You're just gonna listen
to a fellow deputy burn to death?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.076
Haigh, wait...

02:08.296 --> 02:09.456
No, wait!

02:09.672 --> 02:10.707
Wait!

02:24.395 --> 02:26.056
It's notjust that
she could still be alive.

02:26.272 --> 02:27.887
It's that she would've
had to take her death.

02:28.107 --> 02:31.065
Your grandmother,
Lorraine Martin, faked her death?

02:31.277 --> 02:32.483
- Definitely.
- Maybe.

02:32.695 --> 02:33.901
More than likely, yes.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.820
Oh, I'm guessing
you got a story to back this up?

02:37.033 --> 02:38.739
She might be helping The Benefactor.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.699
Or is The Benefactor.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.987
That sounds like a story worth hearing.

02:59.597 --> 03:00.712
Anybody seen Parrish?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.051
Haigh?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.724
Haven't seen him.

03:37.677 --> 03:38.666
Holy...

03:46.102 --> 03:47.091
You're dead.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.107
Hey. Hey!

03:55.069 --> 03:56.354
But you're dead!

05:03.471 --> 05:05.086
He covered you in gasoline?

05:06.474 --> 05:08.055
It's the hair and nails, isn't it?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.675
The parts of the body
that are essentially dead.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.385
Well, they should be gone.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.103
l was set on fire.
All of me should be gone.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.522
Not if you're like us.

05:16.734 --> 05:17.769
Like you?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.271
- I don't think he's like us.
- Then what is he?

05:20.488 --> 05:23.400
- Sorry, but I have no idea.
- But you knew about Jackson and Kira.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.607
This is a little out of my experience.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.568
There might be something in the bestiary.
Did you try Argent?

05:28.788 --> 05:31.450
- I don't know where he is.
- Okay, hold on. What's a bestiary?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.281
Actually,
that's not even my first question. Just...

05:34.502 --> 05:36.788
Just tell me one thing.
Are all of you like Lydia?

05:38.756 --> 05:39.871
Are you all psychic?

05:41.133 --> 05:43.249
- Psychic?
- Yeah.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.213
Not exactly.

05:46.222 --> 05:49.134
Okay. Then what are you?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.526
- All right, Mr. Stilinski...
- Sheriff.

06:03.489 --> 06:04.945
Sheriff Stilinski.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.534
I've got you scheduled for surgery
first thing in the morning.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.324
Unfortunately, it's going
to take a little digging

06:09.537 --> 06:11.073
to get that slug out of your shoulder.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.824
Yeah, it's fine.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.950
One more.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.077
What's this part here? This line?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.377
Patient Responsibility.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.423
Parts of the procedure and hospital stay
not covered by insurance.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.092
Are those big parts?
Expensive parts?

06:27.263 --> 06:29.003
That's between you
and your insurance unfortunately.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.762
You should start feeling
the morphine in a minute.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.173
Try to get some rest, Mr...

06:32.893 --> 06:34.008
Sheriff.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.694
Hey, stop that.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.445
l was just curious
about the terminology.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.489
We're not in any kind of dire straits.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.692
I know about the bills, Dad.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.875
I know about the collectors
calling about Eichen House.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.745
I know about the advance
from the department,

06:58.961 --> 06:59.996
about the credit cards.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.330
Stiles,

07:02.172 --> 07:03.708
are you going through my stuff?

07:03.883 --> 07:06.420
Yeah, I go through all of your stuff.
Especially when you keep things from me.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.799
I keep things from you because
you don't need to know everything.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.425
Yes, I do. l have to know everything.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.472
How the hell else
am I supposed to take care of you?

07:14.685 --> 07:16.641
You're not supposed
to take care of me!

07:17.688 --> 07:20.225
I'm the dad.
You're the son.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.807
You get it?
Dad. Son.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.810
I take care of you.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.078
We're supposed to
take care of each other.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.707
Hey, we're going to be all right.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.168
How do you know, Dad?

07:48.802 --> 07:49.928
I don't.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.384
But the morphine's kicking in.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.725
I'm not all that worried
about anything right now.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.690
But I am.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.527
What's a Kanima?

08:18.749 --> 08:20.580
We'll get back to that.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.909
Just know that everyone like us,

08:23.128 --> 08:25.380
everyone with some kind
of supernatural ability

08:25.589 --> 08:28.376
- is on the dead pool.
- But I don't even know what I am.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.253
I'm pretty sure they don't care.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.634
How many professional assassins
are we talking about?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.427
We're starting to lose count.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.225
But is it still just professionals?

08:38.310 --> 08:41.097
I don't think Haigh's ever
tried anything like this.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.974
I think he was taking a chance.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.400
That means anyone with the dead pool
can take a chance.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.899
But if Haigh had it,
then who else does?

08:48.112 --> 08:49.977
How easy is it to get this thing now?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.742
Meredith was only
at my grandmother's lake house once.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.617
But I think once was enough.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.585
How did your grandmother know her?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.127
She didn't.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.463
She found her.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.924
Because of another woman
named Maddy.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.676
The woman she loved.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.307
I never met her,

10:49.191 --> 10:50.681
but I saw her name everywhere.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.726
She used to be
part of a yacht racing team.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.607
There were plaques
and trophies in the lake house

10:56.824 --> 10:59.486
- from all the regattas she'd won.
- How did she die?

10:59.701 --> 11:02.784
How's not the story.
It's what happened right before.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.404
My grandmother, Lorraine,

11:06.083 --> 11:08.574
used to work in San Francisco for IBM.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.459
She was there on a weekend,

11:15.843 --> 11:17.333
catching up on work.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.925
She started hearing this sound...

11:24.351 --> 11:26.091
Like rain.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.889
But when she looked out the windows...

11:30.983 --> 11:32.939
All she saw was blue sky.

11:33.152 --> 11:35.143
But she kept hearing the rain?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.899
And itjust kept getting louder.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.281
Rain and thunder

11:41.493 --> 11:44.826
cracking like gunshots in her head.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.447
So loud.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.575
She finally just screamed.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.786
Like a Banshee.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.633
She called Maddy,
who was planning on

12:00.095 --> 12:02.211
taking one of the
boats out on the lake.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.756
But Maddy said
that the sun was shining there too.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.637
So Lorraine didn't say anything.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.140
There was an accident?

12:12.941 --> 12:16.183
It took them four days
to find Maddy's body.

12:18.030 --> 12:21.773
And then it took decades
to figure out how Lorraine knew.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.900
She started with parapsychologists,

12:25.120 --> 12:28.112
like the PhD in their name
made it more scientific.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.072
They built the study in the lake house

12:30.250 --> 12:33.413
according to every
pseudoscientific theory they could find.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.173
None of it worked.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.627
Then she started
getting into more extreme occult.

12:39.843 --> 12:43.552
Things like mediums and psychics.
All of them were failures.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.383
Until Meredith.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.931
They found her at Eichen House.

12:48.143 --> 12:51.852
This fragile girl who didn't understand
the things she heard.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.605
They brought her to the study.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.602
And they almost killed her.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.033
She was hospitalized for over a year.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.487
She

13:11.625 --> 13:12.990
never really recovered.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.962
My grandmother drove her insane.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.046
And I drove her to suicide.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.457
And all she ever wanted to do was help.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.849
My grandmother created
the code for the dead pool.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.394
They think she's the Banshee
who put the names out in the first place.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.772
She left me this message
in the same code.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.351
But she didn't leave
a cipher key, did she?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.441
Careful with that.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.401
I thought you didn't like guns.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.872
Does this have something
to do with your eyes?

14:37.044 --> 14:40.127
My eyes, my strength, the healing...

14:41.840 --> 14:43.922
- All of it.
- Gone?

14:44.676 --> 14:48.419
Whatever Kate did to me,
it's still happening.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.266
If the dead pool
really was made by a Banshee

14:54.478 --> 14:57.094
then there's something else
that you should know about.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.808
Your name broke the third list.
It was a cipher key.

15:03.362 --> 15:06.729
And the two other keys
were Allison and Aiden.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.654
And I...
I don't want to make you nervous,

15:08.825 --> 15:12.317
but it kind of feels like there
might be a pattern there, doesn't it?

15:12.537 --> 15:14.073
Allison, Aiden...

15:15.415 --> 15:16.530
You.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.240
Names picked by a Banshee.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.960
It... It could mean that you're in danger.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.497
Scott, Banshees don't predict danger.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.342
They predict death.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.801
Three, four, five, six, seven...

17:05.317 --> 17:06.306
Liam!

17:06.526 --> 17:07.936
Hey. Am I gonna see you
at the bonfire tonight?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.271
Uh...

17:09.488 --> 17:11.103
I'm thinking about skipping it.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.779
- You're not skipping.
- Why not?

17:13.074 --> 17:15.690
Because you're on the lacrosse team.
Don't you have to go?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.655
I don't, uh...

17:22.501 --> 17:25.334
- I... I don't think I can make it.
- You're coming.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.628
And we're gonna find you a nice girl that
you can embarrass yourself in front of

17:28.840 --> 17:31.923
and find me a lacrosse player.
Because statistically speaking,

17:32.135 --> 17:34.626
someone on your team
has gotta be on my team.

17:34.846 --> 17:35.926
All right?

17:37.015 --> 17:37.970
Liam?

17:39.851 --> 17:41.807
Okay. I'll be there.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.607
Try Maddy.
It's got to be Maddy.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.775
Doesn't Maddy feel a little
obvious as a cipher key?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.364
I guarantee it's Maddy.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.079
Okay, your name.
She left the code for you, right?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.997
So it's got to be your name.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.039
Your mom's name?

18:12.842 --> 18:15.424
Do you have any beloved family pets?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.598
All right...

18:22.811 --> 18:24.893
Now I know the start of season bonfire,

18:25.105 --> 18:26.766
it's a big deal for you guys.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.644
I also know
it gets out-of-hand sometimes.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.726
The alumni show up,
there's other teams, and alcohol.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.358
Lots and lots of alcohol.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.572
All right.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.316
Shut up!

18:41.037 --> 18:42.618
Now, what I don't understand is

18:42.831 --> 18:44.617
why anybody would
ever want to get stumbling down drunk

18:44.833 --> 18:47.370
in front of a massive open fire.

18:47.586 --> 18:50.419
I'm also resigned to not
being able to stop you guys.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.717
I also remind you,

18:55.385 --> 18:58.297
your team captain, McCall,
will be there.

18:58.513 --> 18:59.798
And I can count on him

18:59.973 --> 19:02.806
to narc on any
and every one of these little bastards.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.515
Get back to class.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.778
The ashes were left for you.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.158
The code was left for you.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.617
You're supposed to be
able to figure this out.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.036
But no one else is.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.330
Which is why she made it hard.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.793
Oh, my God.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.580
Okay?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.676
You...

19:41.640 --> 19:43.096
"No one else."

19:44.517 --> 19:45.893
No one else but you.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.675
What?

19:47.896 --> 19:50.512
Our guesses.
They're all about Lorraine.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.018
Right? We keep trying to guess a word
that has something to do with her.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.146
So, maybe we should
be trying to guess one that's about you.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.274
Me? What about me?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.606
What do you remember
doing with your grandmother?

20:00.825 --> 20:02.656
You know, what was you guys',
like, special thing?

20:02.827 --> 20:05.409
Did you guys... Did you go to the beach?
You know, did you like ice cream or...

20:05.622 --> 20:08.034
- We read.
- Okay. What did you read?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.247
The Little Mermaid.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.200
You read that movie?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.160
It was a book first.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.541
Hans Christian Andersen.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.456
Type it in. "Little Mermaid."

20:27.268 --> 20:28.883
We read it every night.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.435
I got so obsessed with it,

20:30.647 --> 20:32.808
for three months
I wouldn't respond to anything but Ariel.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.523
It drove my parents crazy, but...

20:38.446 --> 20:40.528
Grandma thought it was adorable.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.790
Hey.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.291
You okay?

21:04.931 --> 21:05.886
Hey.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.895
Last night my printer went off by itself.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.764
I couldn't turn it off.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.562
I hit the cancel button.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.315
- But it just kept printing.
- Printing what?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.080
What the hell is this?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.798
Okay. You recognize any of these?

21:50.018 --> 21:51.599
Just my grandmother.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.141
Lydia...

22:00.111 --> 22:01.647
We need to call Scott.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.152
You see the difference?

22:10.789 --> 22:12.745
Derek's not on the list anymore.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.793
And I'm not worth three million.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.667
It's 18 now.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.372
$18 million.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.639
Well, it's not another dead pool.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.682
More like an already dead pool.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.685
All of them?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.057
AII dead?

22:37.232 --> 22:38.517
Within the last 10 years.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.849
AII suicides.
And all at the same place.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.562
Eichen House.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.590
Hey.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.798
- What are you doing here?
- Getting drunk.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.263
- What are you doing?
- Trying to make sure no one gets hurt.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.886
That sounds fun too.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.812
I don't want to ruin your night or anything,
but we kind of can't get drunk.

24:43.024 --> 24:43.979
What?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.186
I think it has something
to do with our healing.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.319
But, trust me, I've tried.
You're not gonna feel anything.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.940
Maybe you should tell him that.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.994
Lydia, Eichen House isn't a library.
You need a warrant to get files from there.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.079
My grandmother left me
a list of 10 suicides,

25:08.299 --> 25:10.915
including her own.
There's got to be a reason why.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.547
Is there anyone
there who's willing to help us?

25:14.847 --> 25:17.759
No. But there might be someone
willing to take a bribe.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.771
Not gonna tell me to slow down?

25:33.241 --> 25:35.448
Actually,
I was gonna say, "Keep drinking."

25:35.660 --> 25:37.400
I think you should get drunk.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.244
And I mean stumbling down,
fall on your ass,

25:40.456 --> 25:42.788
passed out
with your face in a toilet drunk.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.615
Why?

25:44.836 --> 25:46.792
Maybe then
when I ask you what's going on,

25:47.005 --> 25:48.620
you'll be too drunk to lie.

25:52.844 --> 25:55.335
I'm not asking this
because I want to know.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.262
I'm asking because I want to help.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.982
I'm gonna get another drink.

26:08.651 --> 26:09.640
Yeah...

26:11.863 --> 26:13.069
I'm getting drunk.

26:19.537 --> 26:20.492
A thousand.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.115
A thousand dollars?

26:22.623 --> 26:25.239
To use one little key
to open up one little file room?

26:25.460 --> 26:26.449
Are you out of your mind?

26:26.669 --> 26:29.001
When you get the keys,
you make the price.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.328
Right.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.880
You actually think
we have that kind of money?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.593
I know you don't.

26:34.844 --> 26:38.382
If you did, Daddy Sheriff
would've paid the bill by now.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.305
That's why I'm talking to her.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.602
I have $500.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.253
Follow me.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.559
- I just want to talk.
- Well, Ijust want to dance.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.019
We had our reasons.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.105
- We didn't tell you about Peter...
- To protect me.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.604
That's what Peter said you would say.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.278
And guess what he said next?
That you were right.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.192
- Does that surprise you?
- No. It makes me wonder what he wants.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.239
Malia, we need to stay together.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.787
- You, me, Stiles...
- I don't want to talk about Stiles.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.792
I just want to dance.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.079
And get drunk.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.297
Malia... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

27:59.011 --> 28:00.842
You are drunk.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.090
Yep.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.807
But you can't be.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.934
Is this what drunk feels like?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.603
It doesn't feel as good as I hoped.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.352
I don't think it's supposed to.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.615
Good?

28:22.827 --> 28:24.783
Yeah. We can help ourselves.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.112
Uh, Lydia, you got the list?

28:37.925 --> 28:40.382
Lydia, why did you
write another name on here?

28:40.595 --> 28:43.132
- I didn't write anything.
- This is your handwriting.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.303
Why would I write another name?

28:46.142 --> 28:47.678
Why would you write mine?

28:49.854 --> 28:52.687
It was the tapes, wasn't it?

29:02.450 --> 29:03.781
Your turn, sweetheart.

29:14.587 --> 29:15.952
And who the hell are you?

29:16.881 --> 29:18.417
Hello, Deputy.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.379
I'm a US. Marshal
working in conjunction with this office,

29:23.804 --> 29:26.011
and I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.135
Yeah, well, I got a question.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.308
How'd you get those scars?

29:31.854 --> 29:35.221
A werewolf.
How'd you break your nose?

29:35.775 --> 29:37.185
What's that supposed to...

29:43.824 --> 29:44.779
Malia...

29:48.913 --> 29:50.528
What's in this?
What did you have to drink?

29:50.706 --> 29:51.991
Just vodka.

29:54.919 --> 29:56.955
Stay on your feet
and keep moving.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.617
Help us!

30:29.787 --> 30:30.776
Help us!

30:32.331 --> 30:33.571
Someone, help!

30:34.083 --> 30:36.244
Lydia, there's a lot of people
screaming for help in a place like this.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.620
I don't think anyone's listening.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.748
Well, I'm open to better ideas.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.549
Because if you didn't notice,
all of those suicides were murders.

30:44.969 --> 30:48.803
- That's why she left you the message.
- She predicted her own death.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.138
She knew I'd figure it out.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.136
Once you were able
to predict your own.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.555
But they weren't murders.

31:01.402 --> 31:04.940
I'm not some serial killer
like Ted Bundy

31:05.156 --> 31:07.647
going around cutting up college girls.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.861
No, you're just an Angel of Death.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.287
I don't think you understand
my level of commitment

31:15.499 --> 31:17.239
to my work here, Stiles.

31:18.669 --> 31:22.002
There are people here
who don't simply need treatment.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.920
They need release.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.882
I helped them.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.757
I helped Lorraine.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.680
You killed her.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.216
I helped her.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.351
And now you can help me.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.309
Because there is something about it

31:46.489 --> 31:48.730
that's always bothered me.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.385
Malia?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.427
How much has he had to drink?

32:16.894 --> 32:18.805
Not enough to get him like this.

32:22.817 --> 32:24.853
Something's happening.
We need to get them out of here.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.105
I think we're gonna have to, um...

32:31.409 --> 32:32.899
How much did you drink?

32:35.037 --> 32:37.619
Nothing. Not even a sip.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.602
It's not the drinks.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.188
It's the music.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.705
What are you...
Brunski, what are you doing?

33:29.842 --> 33:32.754
Don't worry, Lorraine.
It's going to be all right.

33:32.970 --> 33:35.632
You're just going to have
a little trouble breathing.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.761
Lydia, look at me. Don't listen.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.601
Okay, don't listen to it.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.274
Just focus on my voice, a" right?

33:46.484 --> 33:48.566
Don't listen to it, block it out.

33:48.777 --> 33:49.766
Okay?

33:52.072 --> 33:53.152
Lydia?

33:55.034 --> 33:56.990
- Hey, turn it off!
- Stop!

33:58.496 --> 33:59.736
Then listen...

34:00.289 --> 34:01.995
Just listen.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.789
I need your help with this, Lydia.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.787
Please don't...

34:09.965 --> 34:11.341
Here it is.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.718
This is the part I never understood.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.420
Listen.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.216
Please don't hurt her.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.555
Don't hurt who?

34:24.522 --> 34:25.762
Ariel.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.870
I have to...

34:50.381 --> 34:52.246
I have to turn off the music.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.457
Don't let them out of your sight.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.709
Wait... Stop.

35:40.389 --> 35:41.378
Let's go.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.260
Hey, what are you doing?
These are my friends.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.059
Your friends are overly intoxicated.
They need to be escorted out.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.182
- Okay, I'll go with them.
- That won't be necessary.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.729
I said they're my friends...

35:52.443 --> 35:53.649
You okay, dude?

36:10.461 --> 36:12.668
What is that?
What are you doing?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.623
It's gasoline.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.376
Haigh says we gotta burn you.

36:49.833 --> 36:53.417
We get a lot of teenagers
trying to break into our drug cabinets.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.834
Most of the time they don't succeed.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.002
But you two

37:05.516 --> 37:07.381
look pretty clever to me.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.612
- What happened to the gun?
- You're covered in gasoline.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.913
Oh, yeah.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.130
I'll admit, Stiles,

39:05.594 --> 39:07.710
I don't have any unusual talents

39:07.930 --> 39:09.090
like Lydia,

39:09.723 --> 39:10.963
but, somehow,

39:11.850 --> 39:15.138
I just knew we were
gonna get a chance to do this again.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.105
No. No. No.

39:20.567 --> 39:21.431
No!

39:22.611 --> 39:23.691
Drop it.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.272
Take your thumb off that needle
and slowly withdraw it from her neck.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.282
Young Deputy.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.204
You're just a kid.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.446
I bet you've never even fired a...

39:43.841 --> 39:45.706
He... He killed my grandmother.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.218
He was controlling Meredith.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.970
He used her to create the dead pool.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.394
And he killed her
when she tried to help us.

40:10.951 --> 40:11.906
You...

40:12.119 --> 40:13.825
You think it was me?

40:18.166 --> 40:20.999
That I was controlling her?

40:24.631 --> 40:25.791
Idiots...

40:29.094 --> 40:31.881
She was controlling me.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.472
Oh, God.

40:48.697 --> 40:49.937
It's not him.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.069
He's not The Benefactor.

40:54.703 --> 40:55.658
No.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.782
And... He wasn't on my list.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.500
But he was a bad person.
