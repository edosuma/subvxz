<i> HELL
(EL NARCO) </i>

00:51.400 --> 00:54.600
- I'm leaving, Ma.
- Take care of yourself.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.400
Pedro.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.799
- I love you cabrón.
- Don't worry.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.000
As soon as I make a few bucks, 
I'll come back for you.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.000
<i> 20 YEARS LATER...</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:28.200
<i>Through my mom, I'm Mexican,</i>

02:29.601 --> 02:32.034
<i>By destiny, I am American,</i>

02:32.035 --> 02:35.200
<i> I'm from the golden race,</i>

02:36.000 --> 02:39.200
<i> I'm Mexican American.</i>

02:43.800 --> 02:46.799
<i> I understand English,</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:50.000
<i> But I also speak Spanish,</i>

02:50.800 --> 02:54.000
<i> I'm from the noble race,</i>

02:54.300 --> 02:57.399
<i> I'm Mexican American.</i>

02:57.400 --> 02:59.434
Your money, man.

02:59.435 --> 03:01.600
Gimme your money or I'll kill you. 
Come on.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.600
You have it there, your dough, I know it. 
Give it, give it.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.600
And the watch.

03:19.101 --> 03:22.300
<i> Zacatecas to Minnesota, </i>

03:22.600 --> 03:25.800
<i> From Tijuana to New York, </i>

03:26.100 --> 03:29.300
<i>The sun and earth countries, </i>

03:29.600 --> 03:32.800
<i> I defend them with my honor.</i>

03:37.600 --> 03:40.800
<i> Two languages and two countries, </i>

03:41.100 --> 03:44.099
<i>Two cultures that I have,  </i>

03:44.100 --> 03:47.300
<i> I'm proud of my luck, </i>

03:47.600 --> 03:50.800
<i> For it's God will. </i>

03:54.500 --> 03:55.800
Shit.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.200
How are you, Ma?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.200
I'm Benjamin.
Don't you recognize me?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.200
Benjamin!

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400
Son of a bitch!

05:41.500 --> 05:43.700
Thanks, Ma.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.700
The thing I missed most
about Mexico was your food.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.834
I was sick of
hot dogs and cheeseburgeres.

05:51.835 --> 05:54.899
I really can't believe you.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.999
20 years on the other side and
you didn't even send a dollar.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.099
I thought you were dead.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.199
You were right, Ma.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.034
But if you saw how bad it was.

06:04.035 --> 06:06.400
Have you heard from your father?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.300
I went out to see if he passed by
in the street, but...

06:09.800 --> 06:11.834
The U.S. is such a big place, Ma.

06:11.835 --> 06:15.000
Like father, like son.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.200
Hey, where is Pedro?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.600
Did he go to start working in San Miguel?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.299
No.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.299
Your brother was killed like a dog!

06:26.300 --> 06:30.500
He hung out with the wrong crowd,
and one day he was shot.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.300
They killed him, Ma?

06:33.800 --> 06:35.899
But...

06:35.900 --> 06:38.334
Why didnt you tell me!?

06:38.335 --> 06:40.599
Ah! So now you're
interested in your little brother?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.000
But in 20 years you didn't
even send a postcard.

06:43.001 --> 06:46.099
At least to know where you were!

06:47.400 --> 06:48.899
My Bro!

06:48.900 --> 06:53.100
If you had kept your promise, 
he'd still be with us today.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.600
My brother.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.199
- What happened?
- Don't you know?

08:11.200 --> 08:14.299
This is our daily bread.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.399
Remember that we are at war.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.600
War?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.300
Take a good look at those kids.
That's how the assholes start.

08:25.301 --> 08:27.801
Once they start, these idiots.

08:27.802 --> 08:30.334
They'll both end up like him.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.399
Move, Benja, the cops are coming.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.600
Hurry, let's go.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.600
Come on, Ma, let's go.
We have nothing to do here.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.000
Good morning, ma'am.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.299
- Yes, young man?
- I wanted to ask you.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.334
Do you know what happened 
to the tire repair shop next door?

09:20.335 --> 09:22.500
- Ah, the Garcia's one?
- Yes

09:22.800 --> 09:24.834
About eight years ago they moved...

09:24.835 --> 09:27.535
...to the new highway, I think at 18 km.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.000
Right next to a junkyard.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.834
And do you know if Rogaciano Garcia
still owns it?

09:32.835 --> 09:34.799
Not that I know.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.834
Everything is so different, isn't it?

09:36.835 --> 09:38.834
Why so many questions?
You from around here?

09:38.835 --> 09:41.000
Don't you recognize me?

09:41.800 --> 09:44.000
It's me, Benjamin Garcia.
Benny.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.000
I was a friend of your son, Beto.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.300
No wonder you looked familiar.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.799
And where is Beto?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.834
I just came from the other side
and would love to see him.

09:57.835 --> 10:01.000
We buried him six years ago.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.400
Oh, ma'am.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.234
Sorry, and may God rest his soul.
And Spirit.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.300
And don't you want to know
how my boy died?

10:17.900 --> 10:20.934
It was your brother, El Diablo,
that killed him.

10:20.935 --> 10:22.599
My brother?

10:22.600 --> 10:27.300
So, if you're planning to stay around here, 
be very careful, asshole.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.599
Thanks for the heads up, ma'am...

10:29.600 --> 10:34.634
...and... I repeat: I'm truly sorry.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.634
You can't feel sorrier than I do.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.600
Cochiloco, guess who's back in San Miguel.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.300
How can I help you?

11:07.302 --> 11:09.799
Sorry, Mr., but... "No english."

11:09.800 --> 11:12.334
What is happening Godfather?

11:12.335 --> 11:15.500
Don't you remember your
favorite godson anymore?

11:18.300 --> 11:21.600
What a sight for sore eyes, godson!

11:22.600 --> 11:24.334
Look at you!

11:24.335 --> 11:26.234
You look like shit, you damned pocho!

11:26.235 --> 11:28.299
Look who's talking, Godfather.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.099
Just because I'm so happy to see you...

11:31.100 --> 11:34.300
...I won't beat the shit out of you
like when you were a kid.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.300
Let me get some beers to celebrate.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.000
<i>CRISIS AND VIOLENCE
DEVASTATE THE COUNTRY</i>

11:47.800 --> 11:50.500
Had I known about this,
I'd have stayed on the other side.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.000
You have no idea what
this country has become.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.834
It couldn't be worse than
when I left, Godfather.

11:57.835 --> 12:01.834
Just imagine. Crisis, unemployment...

12:01.835 --> 12:04.000
...violence.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.000
This year there are around 13,000 dead.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.000
Almost, like a Civil War, all against all.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.899
Just like a curse.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.434
Yeah, but tell me how you are.

12:17.435 --> 12:20.201
How were you treated by the gringos?

12:20.202 --> 12:22.934
20 years is a long time, isn't it?

12:22.935 --> 12:25.451
Didn't you make loads of cash?

12:25.452 --> 12:28.100
That... Godfather...
What can I tell you?

12:28.900 --> 12:31.934
Godfather, what do you
know about my brother?

12:31.935 --> 12:34.100
I heard so many things...

12:35.200 --> 12:38.234
The last that I heard,
he left your mother's ranch.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.400
He was sick of being poor.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.234
He came to San Miguel, and got
involved with the wrong crowd...

12:44.235 --> 12:46.751
Very, very bad folks.

12:46.752 --> 12:49.400
Drug dealers, addicts, murderers.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.600
Everyone knew him as El Diablo.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.399
- No kidding?
- Yes

12:55.400 --> 12:58.600
And he became so famous
that everyone feared him.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.600
Until, one day he turned up dead.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.434
They say he was shot 60 times.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.600
60 times!?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.600
- And who killed him?
- It could have been anyone.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.600
In this town they'll kill you for any reason.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.600
Who can tell me more
about what happened?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.600
Your brother lived with a woman
around the time he was killed.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.434
She's called Guadalupe Soliz.

13:24.435 --> 13:26.899
And she works at the Salon Mexico.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.534
A fucking cesspool...

13:29.535 --> 13:31.835
...with a shit reputation in the
Red Light District of San Miguel.

13:31.935 --> 13:34.100
A whore?

14:11.800 --> 14:14.300
Hey!
Are you alone or expecting someone?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.634
I just want "a beer".

14:16.635 --> 14:18.634
- Only one beer?
- Oh, yes.

14:18.635 --> 14:20.699
Gloria!

14:20.700 --> 14:23.734
Move your ass! Bring the Señor a beer.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.500
Sit.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.800
Hello handsome.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.634
Won't you buy me a drink?

14:37.635 --> 14:39.599
Some other day, darling.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.199
But I wanted to ask you...

14:42.200 --> 14:45.900
...if by chance you know
Señora Guadalupe Soliz.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.999
Lupe?

14:48.000 --> 14:51.200
I'll see if she's busy,
and if not I'll send her over.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.000
What's up, honey?
What can I do for you?

15:10.300 --> 15:12.299
Sit down, beautiful.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.500
Can I get you something to drink?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.000
I'm busy just now.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
But if you hold on then I'll
take care of you.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.799
No, it's not like that.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.834
I am Benjamin Garcia.
Benny. I'm Pedro's brother.

15:28.835 --> 15:31.834
I don't know if he told you
something about me.

15:31.835 --> 15:34.600
So you're the famous Benny.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.334
I only just found out about what
happened to my brother and...

15:40.335 --> 15:43.500
...I wonder if you can tell me 
anything about it.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.000
I can already imagine how it must
have been for you to hear that news.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.200
I'd love to talk, but I can't do it now.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.334
You know, I'll give you my address.

15:56.335 --> 15:59.000
I'm done around 8:00 p.m.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.199
If you want to we can meet then.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.234
What are you doing with my woman,
motherfucker?

16:06.235 --> 16:09.234
Take it easy, babe, he's a relative.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.400
- He was just leaving, right?
- Yes

16:21.800 --> 16:23.500
Hey, brother-in-law.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.800
Here's the address.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.800
Take care of yourself.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.400
What do you want, man?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.734
I'm looking for Mrs. Lupita. 
She lives here, right?

17:03.735 --> 17:05.065
She's not here now.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.099
Besides, dickhead, you should know...

17:07.101 --> 17:09.134
...that she doesn't take
customers at home.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.034
Take it easy, pal. I'm a not customer.
I'm Benjamin Garcia.

17:12.035 --> 17:15.200
- Her brother-in-law.
- Uncle Benny.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.200
From the U.S.?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.499
I am also called Benjamin,
I am your nephew!

17:21.500 --> 17:25.700
Come on in, Uncle, don't stand there.
My mom'll be here soon. Come in.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.799
Do you want anything to drink?

17:31.800 --> 17:35.300
No, I better wait until your Ma arrives.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.000
Sit down Uncle, do don't stand around. 
Sit down.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.199
Listen only,

17:52.200 --> 17:54.234
It is true that you got rich there "Gringolandia"?

17:54.235 --> 17:56.800
My Pa said that you were
making piles of cash.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.734
More or less.
But tell me about yourself.

17:59.735 --> 18:02.234
How did you get along with your father?

18:02.235 --> 18:04.199
- Do you remember him?
- Of course.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.665
My father was the most badass dude
in this damn town.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.733
They say he was great with girls...

18:08.734 --> 18:11.234
...and even better with guns.

18:11.235 --> 18:13.234
And they say he killed
more than 20 fuckers.

18:13.235 --> 18:15.251
Well, I'd rather hear about you.

18:15.252 --> 18:17.234
How old are you?

18:17.235 --> 18:19.199
Me? 16.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.199
Stop being such a liar.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.834
Actually I'm 14, but I look older, right?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.199
What grade are you in?

18:29.200 --> 18:33.400
Better not talk about that, Uncle.
School's not really for me.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.734
Ever wonder what you'll be 
when you grow up?

18:35.735 --> 18:39.300
Of course. What else?
A fuckin' badass like my father.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.599
Hi mom.
Look who's here.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.634
Uncle Benny, the father's brother,
from the United States.

18:47.635 --> 18:50.599
Yes, we already met.
And you guys too?

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
Yes Benjamin and I were
talking about a few things.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.799
Right.
You did finish your homework?

18:56.800 --> 19:00.300
Sure mom, Uncle Benny helped me.
Right, Uncle?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.900
Yeah, right. 
You think you can fool me like that?

19:03.901 --> 19:06.200
Well, get to sleep.
It's late.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.334
See you, Uncle, I have to be going.

19:10.335 --> 19:12.601
See you later, and we'll have some brews.

19:12.602 --> 19:15.000
- Ok, I'm hanging around here for a while.
- Ok then.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.000
How is it possible that my brother...

19:21.001 --> 19:23.100
...could end up that way?

19:23.200 --> 19:26.700
Oh, when I met your brother, 
he was a complete asshole.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.234
But despite it all,
I always loved him a lot.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.234
You know who killed him?

19:31.235 --> 19:33.199
No idea.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.234
Your brother had so many enemies.
It could have been anyone.

19:36.235 --> 19:38.199
An how did my nephew take it?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.234
He was really young When Pedro died.

19:41.235 --> 19:43.199
But he's made him into a hero.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.299
In fact, I am terrified that, living in this town...

19:45.300 --> 19:47.199
...he'll want to to follow in his father's footsteps.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.299
And do you think that what you do is...

19:49.300 --> 19:51.199
...a good example for my nephew?

19:51.200 --> 19:53.299
What are you talking about, idiot.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.800
Come on, Lupita. 
You think working as a whore...

19:55.801 --> 19:57.900
...in a brothel can be good for a...

19:58.300 --> 20:00.299
You know something Benjamin Garcia?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.834
You're worse than your brother, asshole. 
- Lupita...

20:02.835 --> 20:05.334
Get out of here!
Get lost now! Got to hell!

20:08.800 --> 20:10.899
Sorry Lupita. I didn't want...

20:10.900 --> 20:13.100
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

20:18.800 --> 20:23.000
Damn Bro. 
See how you ended up, you asshole.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.400
Drug dealer, murderer...

20:26.900 --> 20:29.934
...pimp, and killed worse than a mongrel.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.934
But I swear the by the Virgin of Guadalupe.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.951
I'll... I'll try help your wife...

20:39.952 --> 20:42.960
...to raise your your kid so he can get ahead.

20:42.961 --> 20:46.100
Things happen for a reason, Bro.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.434
I swear that with God as my witness...

20:50.435 --> 20:52.500
This time I won't let you down.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.100
And may I end up in hell if I don't.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.800
Hey, Godson.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.599
And Lupe?
Is she still hot?

21:02.600 --> 21:06.699
Come on, man, she the widow of my brother.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.299
Oh, come on son, one thing is one thing...

21:09.300 --> 21:12.000
...and another thing is another thing.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.699
Now that is true, she is hot.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.000
What's amazing is how my nephew
looks like my brother.

21:19.300 --> 21:22.300
God forbid he turns out the same.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.299
Fuckin' Benjamin Garcia.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.334
Did you miss me, cabrón?

21:31.335 --> 21:33.334
Look at Fat Mata.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.900
How are you?

21:38.300 --> 21:40.334
I'm not Fat Mata anymore, my friend.

21:40.335 --> 21:42.334
Now everyone knows me as Cochiloco.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.299
Hi there, Don Rogaciano.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.334
Cochiloco! What kind of name is that?

21:46.335 --> 21:48.334
What are you up to?

21:48.335 --> 21:50.351
Right now I'm pissed off.
How can you come back...

21:50.352 --> 21:53.299
...and not come to see your best friend, cabrón!

21:53.300 --> 21:54.834
When did you become such a fucking ingrate!?

21:54.835 --> 21:56.335
I swear I was gonna come to say hello Gordo...

21:56.336 --> 21:58.851
...but I'm here with my Godfather...

21:58.852 --> 22:01.500
I am no longer Fat Mata, Benny, my friend.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.000
Now I'm El Cochiloco, clear?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.600
Okay, I got it...

22:12.900 --> 22:15.100
Benny, you fucking wimp.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.399
Just like when we were kids, man.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.899
We're like brothers,
you can call me whatever you want.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.700
Well when you want, man.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.634
Here, these two are my partners...

22:24.635 --> 22:26.599
...El Huasteco Meretito, from Tampico...

22:26.600 --> 22:29.800
...and this fat faggot is called La Muñeca.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.200
Yes, we've already had the pleasure of meeting.

22:34.335 --> 22:36.999
Let's get one thing straight,
you sons of bitches,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.999
Let me be clear with you.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.934
This litte guy, who looks like a fucked up dwarf,
is a brother to me!

22:42.935 --> 22:46.034
If one of you lays a finger on him,
you'll be dealing with me!

22:46.035 --> 22:48.999
- Is that clear!?
- As water Cochiloco.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.200
Well, sorry about yesterday, my friend.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.999
No worries.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.200
And so, let's have some drinks to celebrate?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.034
Well, Cochiloco, I'm working here with my Godfather.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.999
I can't leave him here alone.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.099
He'll give you permission.
Right, Don Rogaciano?

23:05.100 --> 23:07.000
Or will you make a fuss?

23:07.001 --> 23:08.999
No.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.200
- Let's go.
- Let me change clothes.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.200
Fucking gangsters.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.234
There you go, precious.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.199
Thank you, Cochi!

23:25.200 --> 23:28.200
Me and Benny have known each other 
since we were kids.

23:28.201 --> 23:29.900
Ain't that right?

23:30.200 --> 23:33.299
Ever since then he wanted to go to the other side, 
like a little pocho.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.400
We became friends after he defended me
from an asshole bully.

23:35.401 --> 23:37.200
"Big Ears"

23:37.201 --> 23:39.234
What happened to that guy?

23:39.235 --> 23:41.165
What happens to everyone.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.234
Those who didn't go to
the other side like you, cabrón...

23:43.235 --> 23:45.299
...went into the business and got fucking
wiped out.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.800
May La Niña Blacna and Jesus
keep them in their Holy Glory.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.234
Listen Cochi, tell me the truth.

23:52.235 --> 23:54.300
What happened to my brother?

23:58.300 --> 24:01.600
I'll tell you just so you can
stop thinking about it.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.734
Your brother worked for the
Reyes family like all of us here.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.799
He was a true badass gangster.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.399
But one some other fuckers tried to
take over...

24:10.400 --> 24:12.600
...and he was shot dead.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.234
Sons of fucking bitches.

24:14.435 --> 24:15.965
If it's any consolation,

24:15.966 --> 24:18.899
We paid those cabrones back with interest, 
right?

24:18.900 --> 24:20.200
Thanks, Cochi.

24:20.201 --> 24:22.134
Hey, don't get down about it, Benny.

24:22.135 --> 24:24.899
We came to celebrate
and since you brought it up...

24:24.900 --> 24:27.934
Let's drink, in memory of El Diablo, a true bro.

24:27.935 --> 24:30.934
- Cheers!
- A real badass.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.451
Gloria, bring another bottle.

24:33.452 --> 24:35.710
You know what, girl?
Give me that, I'll take it.

24:35.711 --> 24:38.100
I want to say hi to my friend.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.700
Benny, let me introduce Señora Lupita Soliz.

24:46.500 --> 24:50.534
- She was your brother's wife...
- Yes, yes, we already met.

24:50.535 --> 24:52.499
Isn't that right?

24:52.500 --> 24:55.700
What a pleasure to see you "Cowboy."
Especially in such good company.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.700
What did you do to her for her to
treat you like that?

25:02.800 --> 25:06.000
Listen, now that you've returned,
how will you make money?

25:06.801 --> 25:08.800
I wanted to do an English language school...

25:08.801 --> 25:11.300
...but as I see how things are.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.834
I think I'll end up
returning to the other side.

25:13.835 --> 25:15.365
Don't be stupid, Benny.

25:15.366 --> 25:17.400
Go back along with the gringos...

25:17.401 --> 25:19.134
...who treat you like shit?

25:19.135 --> 25:20.700
Look.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.800
This country has a lot of opportunities...

25:22.801 --> 25:25.000
...to make money, cabrón.

25:25.035 --> 25:26.699
Or not?

25:26.700 --> 25:29.699
Look at this, the Holy Patron of pure gold.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.334
And let me tell you, if you need anything, 
just let me know...

25:33.835 --> 25:35.900
No, Cochi, thank you but...

25:37.300 --> 25:38.899
Excuse me. Hello?

25:38.900 --> 25:41.100
Sir, what's up?

25:41.900 --> 25:44.100
We'll be there in half an hour.

25:44.900 --> 25:48.100
Let's move, you chimps.
Señor Reyes needs us.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.899
Benny.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.900
Anything you need, give me a shout, okay?

25:52.901 --> 25:54.500
Ok Cochi.

25:54.900 --> 25:58.100
- Hey Cochi, Cochi!
- Put it on my tab, Camilo.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.900
Still angry with me, Lupita?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.800
So?

26:05.900 --> 26:09.100
You want something else or
will you go straight to enjoy the lady?

26:11.400 --> 26:13.600
No, neither, thank you.

26:13.900 --> 26:17.400
If you won't eat or fuck.
Then get the hell out of here, cabrón.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.000
Have a good one, "Cowboy".

26:35.800 --> 26:39.300
Son, this shit gets worse every day.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.600
Not even flies stop here.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.000
Remember that before you went over to 
"Gringolandia"...

26:50.800 --> 26:53.000
...I was even planning to open up
a full auto workshop?

26:54.300 --> 26:56.299
Why didn't you, Godfather?

26:56.300 --> 26:59.300
Because in this fucking country,
you don't do what you want...

26:59.301 --> 27:01.334
...but what you can.

27:01.335 --> 27:05.500
Only by a miracle I haven't had to
sell the tire shop to Reyes.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.799
So who are these Reyes everyone
talks about all over the place?

27:09.800 --> 27:11.800
They're cattle farmers...

27:11.801 --> 27:14.334
...that everyone knows as the
Reyes (Kings) of the North.

27:14.335 --> 27:17.000
The head is the old Joseph.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.800
The one directing it all is Don Jose, 
a fucking son of a bitch...

27:19.801 --> 27:22.734
...who manages all the shady business
throughout the North.

27:22.735 --> 27:25.500
Trafficking, kidnappings, prostitution.

27:26.300 --> 27:30.000
Smuggling and any fucking dirty business 
you can imagine.

27:30.300 --> 27:34.500
But tho old fucker is protected,
from far, far above.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.834
- And the other?
- Hos brother, Don Pancho.

27:37.835 --> 27:41.000
The top boss of San Francisco.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.299
What's the problem between the two?

27:43.300 --> 27:45.800
The thing went rotten when Jose decided that...

27:45.801 --> 27:48.500
...his son, Jesus, would be the successor.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.834
The other Reyes, Pancho was pissed off.

27:51.835 --> 27:53.799
And declared war on his brother.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.800
And since then, they've waging a war here...

27:55.801 --> 27:58.334
...that seems to have no end.

27:58.335 --> 28:00.799
Oh, it would be a good movie.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.799
What fucking movie are you talking about?

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
This narco war has killed more men
than the revolution.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.834
Your friend Cochiloco offered you a job right?

28:10.835 --> 28:14.000
Godfather, that'd be the last thing I would do.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.000
Look, Godson...

28:19.500 --> 28:22.034
All I have in this life...

28:22.035 --> 28:24.700
...which is this little tire shop, is yours too.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.834
But don't make the mistake of following
in the footsteps of your dickhead brother.

28:29.835 --> 28:33.000
What do you think, Godfather?

28:33.800 --> 28:35.799
But since you said we are partners...

28:35.800 --> 28:40.000
...is there a way you'd let me 
borrow some money?

28:58.800 --> 29:01.334
What's up?
To what do I owe the honor?

29:01.335 --> 29:04.800
No, I only wanted to smoke the
peace pipe with you, sister-in-law.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.700
They are very beautiful, thank you.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.000
- Come in.
- Thank you.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.534
That was when we went to Mazatlan.

29:20.535 --> 29:22.499
It was supposed to be a vacation.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.000
He disappeared for 13 days
and when he came back...

29:25.001 --> 29:27.534
...he was shot in the shoulder
and bleeding from head to toe.

29:27.535 --> 29:30.700
We couldn't even visit the Cathedral.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.499
Did you get married?

29:33.500 --> 29:36.000
He offered all the time, but whenever...

29:36.001 --> 29:38.534
...the time came, he found an excuse 
not to go through with it.

29:38.535 --> 29:41.700
Despite all of that, I never
doubted that he loved me.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.499
He did have good taste.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.700
Stop playing, you're seeing me at my worst.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.500
But the truth is that when I was younger.

29:51.501 --> 29:53.534
I used to stop traffic.

29:53.535 --> 29:56.700
Ah, you can still stop traffic
and anything else.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.499
Calm down, "Cowboy."

29:59.500 --> 30:01.534
Can't you see I'm confused.

30:01.535 --> 30:03.499
Confused about what?

30:03.500 --> 30:07.700
You feel them same as me.
Come here.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.400
What's up, son?

30:16.200 --> 30:18.234
I can guess where you've been.

30:18.235 --> 30:20.199
- Out.
- Out.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.234
You've been drinking again, right?

30:22.235 --> 30:24.199
Only one beer, mom.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
You go straight to bed and tomorrow...

30:26.201 --> 30:28.399
... you don't wake up until school, 
or you'll see what happens!

30:28.400 --> 30:30.900
Yes, I got the hint.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.100
Keep on doing whatever you were doing.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.334
- See you, Uncle Benny.
- Yes.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.000
Have fun with my mom.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.400
What a kid.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.800
Just 14 years old,
imagine when he grows up.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.334
To me, it's chilling that he looks so much 
like my brother.

30:51.335 --> 30:53.299
They even talk the same.

30:53.300 --> 30:56.500
You look a lot like him, too.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.934
You know what I was thinking
just now when you kissed me?

30:59.935 --> 31:02.434
Hey, you know Lupita?
I think I'd better go.

31:02.435 --> 31:04.399
Because it's getting late and...

31:04.400 --> 31:07.600
- No, no, no, no,
Don't go away "Cowboy."

31:08.400 --> 31:10.600
I know what I'm talking about.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.100
Come.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.100
You lucky bastard.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.200
Oh my love.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.200
- Oh, you're a pig.
- Oh, yeah?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.700
You'll see, my love.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.034
I'll start working...

31:45.035 --> 31:47.034
...and I'll take care of your kid.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.999
Thank you, my Diablo.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.534
What? Come on, babe.
I'm not El Diablo?

31:51.535 --> 31:53.600
Oh sorry, my mistake.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.000
And where did you sleep last night, cabrón?

32:04.800 --> 32:06.799
I went to visit my mother and...

32:06.800 --> 32:09.834
...it got late, and I stayed there with her.

32:09.835 --> 32:11.799
Oh... your mother.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.799
Of course, your mother...

32:13.800 --> 32:16.834
Think I was born yesterday?...

32:30.736 --> 32:32.534
Your mother's looking for you, asshole.

32:34.335 --> 32:36.299
What it is, babe?

32:36.300 --> 32:38.299
Oh Benny, I have a major problem.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.199
Problem? What happened?

32:40.200 --> 32:42.734
Your fucking nephew did something stupid 
and got arrested.

32:42.735 --> 32:45.000
Arrested?
No kidding...

32:45.300 --> 32:48.000
I'm with these guys and I can't go.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.834
Can you fix this for me?

32:50.835 --> 32:53.601
Of course, my love, don't worry.

32:53.602 --> 32:56.299
But I don't have any cash.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.334
Here. I got 3000 as an advance
and 5000 more coming.

32:59.335 --> 33:01.299
I think that's enough.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.834
Yes, yes, don't worry,
I'll take care of my nephew.

33:03.835 --> 33:05.400
Thank you.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.034
Please take care of this. 
If I finish early I'll see you at home.

33:31.800 --> 33:35.000
I don't think 8000 pesos will cover it, 
Mr. Garcia.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.834
Your nephew's a felon. 
Did you know he tried to steal a truck?

33:38.835 --> 33:40.799
And it belonged to mayor.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.334
Your nephew is a repeat offender.
There's no choice...

33:43.335 --> 33:45.834
...but to have have him locked up,
right, Amaya?

33:45.835 --> 33:48.000
I couldn't have said it better, boss.

33:51.800 --> 33:55.334
Chief, I know the kid committed 
a serious crime.

33:55.335 --> 33:59.000
But is there any way to solve this?

34:00.300 --> 34:02.299
See, Mr. Garcia,

34:02.300 --> 34:05.500
You're starting to remember how it works
in Mexico.

34:07.300 --> 34:11.299
And, more or less, how much will it take 
to solve the problem?

34:11.300 --> 34:13.500
For you, and knowing that you just...

34:13.600 --> 34:15.800
...returned to Mexico, I'll leave it at...

34:15.801 --> 34:18.799
- 50 grand.
- 50,000 pesos!?

34:18.800 --> 34:20.833
Where will I get that kind of money?

34:20.835 --> 34:22.799
Your boy is already booked.

34:22.800 --> 34:27.000
If you don't get the cash before noon, 
I'll just have to process him.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.799
So, tell me, Benny, what's so urgent?

34:37.800 --> 34:40.800
Listen, Cochi, I'm stuck with a big, 
big problem...

34:40.801 --> 34:42.833
...and I'm gonna need to earn some cash.

34:42.835 --> 34:46.833
Hey cabrones! 
Go take a fucking hike.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.699
Come on!

34:49.699 --> 34:52.699
What kind of problem?
You need someone whacked?

34:52.699 --> 34:56.734
No, I'd never do that Cochi.
My nephew is in jail.

34:56.735 --> 34:59.734
And I need 50,000 pesos to help my...

34:59.735 --> 35:01.699
...sister-in-law.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.900
Don’t tell me you're involved with her.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.799
Damn Benny.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.000
I knew about the cousin, but the sister-in-law, 
you bastard?

35:11.800 --> 35:15.799
Don’t think badly Cochi,
it's only to help my nephew.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.400
Oh yeah... fucking sure.

35:17.401 --> 35:19.834
Now it turns out you're running
a fucking charity, man.

35:19.835 --> 35:22.351
That broad is smokin' hot, man!

35:22.352 --> 35:24.799
Easy, Cochi.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.799
I really need the dough...

35:26.800 --> 35:29.834
And you said that if I needed to work...

35:29.835 --> 35:32.000
I could count on you and...

35:32.835 --> 35:35.000
Look, Benny.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.000
In the life of a "Narco"...

35:37.600 --> 35:40.300
...there is very good money.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.634
But it's not easy.

35:42.635 --> 35:44.599
You need big balls, cabrón.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.600
I've thought it through, Cochi,
and I see no other way...

35:47.601 --> 35:50.634
...given how bad things are out there.

35:50.635 --> 35:52.599
Done.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.800
I'll introduce you to the boss.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.134
But I warn you, eh,
Once inside, cabrón...

35:58.135 --> 36:00.634
...there is no turning back.
Clear!?

36:00.635 --> 36:02.800
Oh yes, I appreciate it, Cochi.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.800
Look.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.600
Start by getting to know the shit we sell.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.734
This is what we ship up north.

36:11.735 --> 36:14.800
- No, I don't really want...
- Come on man!

36:18.600 --> 36:20.599
Ouch! Cochi!

36:20.600 --> 36:21.999
This is really good shit.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.500
We deal good fuckin' weed.

36:24.501 --> 36:27.034
- It's a real treasure of the Sierra Madre!
- Oh yes.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.800
Ai, Bennny, you don’t know what you're
getting yourself into, cabrón.

36:36.435 --> 36:38.600
We came to see the Boss.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.034
Take it easy, Benny.

36:54.035 --> 36:56.200
The boss doens't bite.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.534
Just listen, and keep your mouth shut.

36:58.535 --> 37:00.499
- Ok?
- Ok

37:00.500 --> 37:03.034
The boss is loaded.

37:03.035 --> 37:05.801
This is only one of their properties.

37:05.802 --> 37:08.534
He made a fortune in this business.

37:08.535 --> 37:10.499
But what he really loves is...

37:10.500 --> 37:12.499
- Cockfights and raising cattle.
- Oh yeah?

37:12.500 --> 37:15.500
Imagine, he gets up before dawn.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.100
Milking cows and feeding the roosters.

37:18.601 --> 37:21.500
He's got more than enough.

37:23.501 --> 37:26.100
Stand up straight.
Try to look tough.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.299
Go iside and wait.

37:34.300 --> 37:37.500
I'll look go and find Don Jose.
Remember, keep your mouth shut!

38:20.300 --> 38:23.500
Señor.
Benjamin Garcia at your service.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.500
Come in.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.400
Sit down, make yourself at home.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.900
Thank you.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.700
So, you're Pedro's brother?

38:36.701 --> 38:38.034
Yes, sir.

38:38.035 --> 38:40.200
The famous Diablo.

38:40.500 --> 38:44.000
A good guy, but too wild and impulsive.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.834
They told me you lived 
a long time in the United States.

38:47.835 --> 38:49.399
"Oh yes sir."

38:49.400 --> 38:51.365
So you'll agree with me.

38:51.366 --> 38:54.434
I always say that the gringos
fucked this country over.

38:54.435 --> 38:58.399
And that those fucking yank sons of bitches 
robbed us all blind...

38:58.400 --> 39:03.399
...with the help of some our own
fucking lousy presidents.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.400
The only thing they know how to do is
kneel and lick their feet.

39:06.401 --> 39:10.100
Then they turn over and take it up the ass.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.434
According to them, this is capitalism.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.399
They don't realize that that people like me...

39:14.400 --> 39:18.199
We have the means to fuck them up
good and proper.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.599
Oh, Dad.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.599
You speak more like a politician all the time.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.634
The gringos are our best customers.

39:24.635 --> 39:27.151
He shouldn't talk about them like that.

39:27.152 --> 39:29.599
You damned son of a bitch!

39:29.600 --> 39:32.634
You think you're a fucking smart ass?
You know more than me?

39:32.635 --> 39:35.151
Don't ever crack off to me like that again.

39:35.152 --> 39:38.300
Get the fuck outta here!

39:41.400 --> 39:43.399
Fucking kid.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.600
But, of course, I'm to the blame.
I've spoiled him too much.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.600
But sometimes he crosses the line and...

39:52.800 --> 39:55.799
One thing I want you to know.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.334
Those who work with me
are like part of my family.

39:59.335 --> 40:02.834
But in this business,
there are rules and principles...

40:02.835 --> 40:04.799
...that must be followed...

40:04.800 --> 40:07.834
...if you don’t want to end up
shot in the head.

40:07.835 --> 40:09.499
Got it?

40:09.500 --> 40:11.534
Yes. Yes, sir.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.700
One. Honesty.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.200
Two. Total honor.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.999
And Three. Silence.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.999
Absolute silence!
Opening your mouth too much...

40:24.000 --> 40:27.200
...is a good way to get a ticket 
straight to hell.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.999
- Is that clear?
- Yes sir, yes.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.200
And another thing I was forgetting.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.000
Use discretion...

40:34.035 --> 40:37.551
...and don’t walk around like a big shot 
like these assholes do.

40:37.552 --> 40:41.200
People see them coming from a mile away.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.199
Look.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.199
My son Jesus will be be your boss.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.199
He's my only son and I love him 
with all my soul.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.200
If anything happens to him...

40:52.201 --> 40:54.900
...you'll answer with your life.
Is that clear!?

40:55.700 --> 40:57.699
Yes. Yes, sir.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.900
I'll give you an advance
to get yourself equiped.

41:02.900 --> 41:05.600
Soon you will pay me back.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.899
Just be careful, Garcia.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.934
Be careful, there's a lot of profit
in this business.

41:11.935 --> 41:14.899
But there are many temptations.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.400
If you're smart, you'll be careful not to indulge...

41:17.401 --> 41:19.600
...and get hooked on the dope we sell.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.100
As our new Pope already said...

41:23.900 --> 41:27.100
..."Putting garbage in the body is a mortal sin. "

41:27.400 --> 41:30.600
- Of course!?
- Yeah, yes sir, yes.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.334
- May God bless you.
- Thank you Sir.

41:36.335 --> 41:38.834
I promise you I won't let you down.

41:38.835 --> 41:41.799
You're an asshole, son of a bitch, Reyes!

41:41.800 --> 41:44.300
The next time you lay a finger on your son...

41:44.301 --> 41:46.700
...I'll cut off your balls, you asshole.

41:46.701 --> 41:48.134
And you know I'm not talking...

41:48.135 --> 41:49.534
...figuratively, you dickhead.

41:49.535 --> 41:52.099
Oh, my queen, the boy disrespected me.

41:52.100 --> 41:55.834
Don't lie to me, Reyes!
Come here my love, come on.

41:55.835 --> 41:58.000
Your father wants to apologize.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.300
Oh, you fucking prick.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.700
You better to apologize to my son.

42:03.735 --> 42:06.100
Or else you'll deal with me, cabrón.

42:06.135 --> 42:08.800
- Sorry, my son.
- Yes, Pa.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.800
There, you see, J.R.? 
You're dad's a sweet cupcake.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.599
My queen...

42:15.600 --> 42:18.599
...I want to introduce you to Benjamin.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.634
The brother of El Diablo.
He's working with us now.

42:21.635 --> 42:24.599
Oh, pleased to meet you young man.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.800
- Pardon us, senores.
- With your persmission.

42:33.800 --> 42:38.000
Oh, thank you my love.
They are beautiful, and the dress.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.600
Where did you find work?

42:43.400 --> 42:46.100
With a cattle rancher. I'm going to
take care of his herd.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.399
The old guy's not bad.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.600
He even gave me an advance.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.600
You've become a gangster,
working with Cochiloco, right?

42:59.400 --> 43:01.600
You know what?

43:02.400 --> 43:04.399
Take your money.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.434
What do you want, Garcia?
To end up like your brother?

43:07.435 --> 43:09.399
Don’t get confused, beautiful.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.934
One thing is one thing
and another thing is another thing.

43:11.935 --> 43:14.434
You saw that I was looking for work.

43:14.435 --> 43:17.399
And around here, this is all there is.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.934
I'm scared. God already took
one man away from me.

43:21.135 --> 43:24.399
No, I promise you that it's only
until we save some money.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.434
We'll pay the debts, and soon the three of us 
together are going to the U.S.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.434
But swear that you won't end
up like your brother.

43:32.435 --> 43:34.434
By the Virgin of Guadalupe.

43:34.435 --> 43:36.600
Come here, my love.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.499
Well, Benny.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.434
Welcome to the business, 
we're making our first delivery.

44:05.435 --> 44:07.500
Open your eyes, listen and learn.

44:07.501 --> 44:09.200
Ok, Cochi.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.899
Hey, Don Eme.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.934
- Hi, Cochi.
- Why the long face?

44:22.935 --> 44:24.899
Was it a bad week?

44:24.900 --> 44:27.600
I'm fed up with this business.

44:28.100 --> 44:31.500
Five nights working with no sleep,
and I barely broke even, man.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.799
This crisis is really killing me.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.834
Come on, Don Eme.
Every time I drive by your hotel

44:38.835 --> 44:41.399
I see it full of horny bastards.

44:41.400 --> 44:44.834
With or without the crisis,
people still love to fuck.

44:44.835 --> 44:46.299
And this guy?

44:46.300 --> 44:48.365
He's my partner, Benny.

44:48.366 --> 44:51.866
He'll take over for me when I take a vacation 
or retire.

44:51.935 --> 44:53.299
Be nice to him.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.500
Benjamin Garcia, at your service, Don.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.799
What'll it be, Don Eme?

44:57.800 --> 45:01.000
20 grams, a quarter of weed...

45:01.100 --> 45:03.834
...ecstasies, a package of heroin, 12 rocks...

45:03.835 --> 45:07.600
...and 200 hits of meth, 
since they are so fashionable, right?

45:07.800 --> 45:11.000
I thought the crisis was hitting you hard, 
Don Eme.

45:11.300 --> 45:15.500
You don’t want syringes,
Yumbina, some porno?

45:16.300 --> 45:18.334
I've got one of a Swedish girl with a donkey...

45:18.335 --> 45:20.500
- God damn it.
- You fucker.

45:21.300 --> 45:23.500
How much do I owe you?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.300
Oh, man.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.299
Here, keep the change.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.000
Right.

45:38.800 --> 45:41.834
Until next week Don Eme.
Keep your ass clean.

45:41.835 --> 45:45.000
I'll save the water so you can gargle with it, 
cabrón.

45:53.100 --> 45:56.134
How much is this briefcase worth, Cochi?

45:56.135 --> 45:58.700
It's worth a shitload, Benny.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.000
But that, for the Boss, is only peanuts.

46:02.300 --> 46:04.300
The real business is in imports...

46:04.301 --> 46:05.834
...and exports on a large scale.

46:05.835 --> 46:08.000
That's where the real money is.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.234
The bad thing is that with this fucking crisis

46:11.235 --> 46:13.400
The competition is really
fucking with us.

46:13.700 --> 46:15.700
Now any little runt
in the neighborhood can get...

46:15.701 --> 46:17.900
...a gun and start shit in our territory.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.400
We're trying not to lose the goose 
that laid the golden egg.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.000
Look Cochi.

46:31.800 --> 46:34.834
Quiet, calm down.
Don’t get stressed.

46:34.835 --> 46:37.851
Put the briefcase under the seat.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.100
Hey Cochiloco, how's business?

47:07.600 --> 47:09.599
Very well, Chief.
And you?

47:09.600 --> 47:12.599
What are you doing with that fucking pocho?

47:12.600 --> 47:15.565
He began working with Don Jose 
and I am teaching him the business.

47:15.566 --> 47:17.999
Explain to him how it works between us.

47:18.099 --> 47:19.799
Especially how much.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.334
Don’t worry Chief,
I'll bring him up to speed.

47:22.335 --> 47:25.500
Damn right.
See you pricks around.

47:25.800 --> 47:28.834
Ai, Cochi...
That cop scared the shit outta me.

47:28.835 --> 47:31.101
He's a real filthy looking pig.

47:31.102 --> 47:34.000
Hey Cochi, by chance
do you have some speed?

47:34.800 --> 47:37.000
Gotta work the night shift.

47:39.800 --> 47:44.000
Look in the glove compartment
for a brown jar for the Chief, Benny.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.434
Thank you guys,
Be good.

47:54.435 --> 47:57.600
Especially you, fucking Pocho.

48:05.500 --> 48:09.534
Damn Benny, you're as white as a corpse.

48:10.035 --> 48:12.700
Let's have a drink to get your color back.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.465
But not at the Salon Mexico.

48:15.466 --> 48:17.499
If Lupita sees me like this she'll kill me.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
I'll take you to a classy place.

48:19.501 --> 48:22.300
Not that hole-in-the-wall
where your girlfriend works.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.634
Is it expensive?
I'm a little short right now.

48:25.635 --> 48:28.599
Here's a gift from the Reyes.

48:28.600 --> 48:31.599
But this money belongs to the boss, 
doesn't it?

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
Of course it does, don’t be a prick.

48:33.601 --> 48:36.400
You think he'll notice if we skim a little bit?

48:36.635 --> 48:38.599
And if he finds out, Cochi?

48:38.600 --> 48:41.800
This is just part of the business,
we don't risk our asses for free.

48:43.100 --> 48:47.100
Just don't get caught
and don’t abuse it.

48:48.535 --> 48:51.500
Thanks for the advice.

48:55.600 --> 48:59.800
<i>COCK OF GOLD</i>

49:11.800 --> 49:13.834
How do you like the place?

49:13.835 --> 49:15.851
Not fucking bad, eh?

49:15.852 --> 49:18.000
It's pretty fuckin' cool!

49:18.300 --> 49:21.299
What do you think of the gig?

49:21.300 --> 49:24.500
Like everything else, it's just a matter of
getting the hang of it.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.299
And how did it go with Reyes?
Was he nice to you?

49:28.300 --> 49:30.300
Actually I thought he would be meaner, 
but in fact...

49:30.301 --> 49:32.300
...he seemed like a good guy.

49:32.335 --> 49:35.299
Good guy, my ass.

49:35.300 --> 49:38.334
Don Jose is the most nastiest son of a bitch 
who ever walked the earth.

49:38.335 --> 49:41.299
That's why he's in charge.

49:41.300 --> 49:44.334
May St. Jude and the holy St. Malverde...

49:44.335 --> 49:46.299
...protect them for years to come.

49:46.300 --> 49:49.334
Because the day that the Don Jose dies, 
we're totally fucked.

49:49.335 --> 49:52.299
If the business falls into the hands 
of that asshole J.R....

49:52.300 --> 49:55.934
...the Panchos will take over in less
than one month, and fuck us all over.

49:55.935 --> 49:57.299
True.

49:57.300 --> 50:00.834
You have to watch your back 
with those assholes, Benny.

50:00.835 --> 50:02.900
If I ever see one of those Panchitos...

50:02.901 --> 50:04.900
I'll put a bullet right through his ears.

50:05.300 --> 50:08.334
I told you guys my Benny was 
the fucking man.

50:08.335 --> 50:10.500
- Cheers to Benny!
- Cheers!

50:10.800 --> 50:14.234
Let's give him a proper initiation,
like he deserves, right?

50:14.235 --> 50:16.799
Hell wants a nice girl.
Lola! Come here...

50:16.800 --> 50:19.834
Cochiloco, if Lupita find outs, 
she'll cut off my balls.

50:19.835 --> 50:21.799
Don’t be such damned queer!

50:21.800 --> 50:25.000
Look at this girl, man!

50:25.800 --> 50:28.000
Be nice to him, babe.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.300
I promise you, my love
you won't have to work anymore.

50:35.301 --> 50:38.000
I'll take care of your kid.

50:38.801 --> 50:40.934
Benny, put on your clothes quickly
or we're screwed.

50:40.935 --> 50:43.799
- Hurry up!
- But Cochi, I'm not finished.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.834
Don't be a prick. This is work.
The bosses are waiting. Fast!

50:46.835 --> 50:49.000
Hear that, my love?
Hurry up!

50:49.800 --> 50:52.799
So, what's the rush, Cochi?

50:52.800 --> 50:55.834
First things first, right?
Making me stop in the middle of it...

50:55.835 --> 50:57.799
- The brunette was...
- Take this.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.766
No, Cochi, you know I don't...

50:59.767 --> 51:01.565
Come on, take the shit!

51:01.566 --> 51:03.600
If J.R. and the Boss 
see us in this state...

51:03.601 --> 51:04.934
...they'll castrate us.

51:04.935 --> 51:07.000
- Come on, go for it.
- Let's see...

51:12.000 --> 51:13.999
Yes?

51:14.000 --> 51:17.200
Take it easy, J.R.
Yes, were on our way.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.200
Don’t worry.

51:20.500 --> 51:22.534
Yeah, I've got it, the boss wants him alive.

51:22.535 --> 51:24.534
Yes, we'll be there
before the midnight.

51:24.535 --> 51:26.499
Right.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.700
What was that, Cochi?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.034
I'm feeling like new, man.

51:31.535 --> 51:35.200
It's time to be baptized, Benny.
Get ready.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.200
Clean your nose, cabrón.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.800
What's happening, man? 
Where is your brother?

51:52.600 --> 51:55.800
- First the money, right?
- Fucking snitch bastard.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.500
Selling your brother for 1000 pesos.

52:01.301 --> 52:03.799
Son of a fuckin' bitch.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.799
Hey, I'm poor, man.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.000
You probably don't remember what it's like.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.834
What's more, my fucking brother
never wanted to give me a hand.

52:12.835 --> 52:16.000
Ah! Stop fucking around and tell me
where he is before you piss me off even more.

52:16.300 --> 52:19.299
He went in a couple of hours ago.
He should be there.

52:19.300 --> 52:23.500
Hopefully he's not so I have an excuse
to take it out on you instead.

52:24.300 --> 52:26.334
I swear he's there, inside.

52:26.335 --> 52:28.299
Fine, you fuckin' rat,

52:28.300 --> 52:31.500
And remember, we'll see you eventually.

52:32.900 --> 52:34.934
Get your gun ready, Benny.

52:34.935 --> 52:37.100
And take the tape.

52:45.800 --> 52:49.000
If someone runs out,
put a hole into him.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.000
Cockroach!

52:53.800 --> 52:56.000
Cockroach!

52:59.000 --> 53:00.999
Alright, señora, let's hear it.
Where did Cockroach go?

53:01.000 --> 53:02.999
Don’t be a fool. 
Tell me where Cockroach is!

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Think about it Cockroach!

53:05.001 --> 53:07.034
If you don't come out in three seconds
I'll waste your whole family.

53:07.035 --> 53:08.499
One!

53:08.500 --> 53:10.999
- Two!
- Calm down!

53:11.000 --> 53:14.200
- Cochi, I'm here.
- Tie this prick up.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.999
No, no, no, please.
Don't be an asshole, Cochi.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
For old times' sake, let me say goodbye...

53:20.001 --> 53:22.700
...to my wife and children, huh?

53:23.035 --> 53:26.034
Go, I'll give you one minute starting now.

53:26.035 --> 53:28.200
Give me a blessing.

53:30.900 --> 53:33.434
Take care of my children.

53:33.435 --> 53:36.100
- Let's go, let's go!
- No!

53:40.900 --> 53:43.100
Look, Cockroach.

53:43.900 --> 53:46.100
You know you're already screwed...

53:46.900 --> 53:50.400
...but since we're old friends,
I'll give you the chance to take revenge...

53:50.900 --> 53:53.100
...on the fucking weasel that sold you out.

53:53.900 --> 53:56.100
Thanks, Cochi.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.600
I always thought you were a stand-up guy.

54:00.700 --> 54:03.900
Here you go, but no nonsense.
Or else you'll get it back twice as hard.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.000
Keep your eyes on him Benny.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.200
Panfilo!

54:32.000 --> 54:33.700
Panfilo!

54:43.800 --> 54:45.500
Panfilo!

55:02.600 --> 55:06.800
Panfilo, damn it, we came into this world together, 
and we're leaving together.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.834
Thanks, Cochi.

55:10.835 --> 55:13.000
You're a good man, but...

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
Don’t take me to the boss.

55:15.601 --> 55:17.734
If you want, shoot me right now
with my brother...

55:17.735 --> 55:19.999
...but don't take me to that son of a bitch.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.600
Sorry, Cockroach.

55:21.601 --> 55:24.600
Orders are orders. 
I've gotta take you in alive.

55:24.835 --> 55:27.000
Come on, we're late as it is.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.100
Come on!

55:45.400 --> 55:47.600
Who do you think you are, eh?

55:48.400 --> 55:50.399
We've been waiting two hours for you, 
like idiots.

55:50.400 --> 55:53.900
We'll deal with that later.
First things first.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.000
What's up Cockroach?

55:58.500 --> 56:01.534
So many years working
for me without complaining.

56:01.535 --> 56:04.051
I always paid you good money.

56:04.052 --> 56:06.534
So why did you have to go and
talk to the Federales?

56:06.535 --> 56:07.999
No?

56:08.000 --> 56:10.999
What did you tell them?
Look...

56:11.000 --> 56:14.700
If you tell me everything you squealed to them...

56:15.000 --> 56:17.534
...you can still save yourself, man.

56:17.535 --> 56:19.999
I swear it was nothing, Boss.
Nothing.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
I hope it's true, because otherwise
not only will I fuck you up bad

56:23.001 --> 56:25.800
I'll fuck your kids too,
What do you say?

56:26.135 --> 56:29.034
By the holy virgin,
I swear I didn't say anything.

56:29.035 --> 56:31.200
We know everything, you fucking idiot!

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Okay, okay,
Cockroach.

56:35.001 --> 56:37.034
I believe you,
I believe you.

56:37.035 --> 56:38.999
Only in this business...

56:39.000 --> 56:43.200
...there are rules and principles 
that must be respected and fulfilled.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.500
You know what happens to snitches, 
don't you?

56:46.501 --> 56:49.200
Cochiloco, give me the knife.

56:49.500 --> 56:53.000
You take the head, hold on!

56:54.500 --> 56:56.284
No!
No!

56:56.285 --> 56:58.200
Open up, open! You little fucker!

57:02.500 --> 57:04.534
And this is for stealing!

57:04.535 --> 57:06.700
Give it to me!

57:16.800 --> 57:20.000
And this is to cure you of stupidity, cabrón!

57:32.200 --> 57:34.400
- Come on, my son.
- Yes, Pa.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.100
What's going on my love?
What happened?

57:56.900 --> 58:01.100
What can I tell you, my love?
Look at my hands?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.534
You probably had to do something horrible, right?

58:04.535 --> 58:05.999
No, not me.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.999
The boss is batshit crazy.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.999
I swear it was the most
horrible thing I've ever seen.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.500
I can imagine, but the way the situation is...

58:15.501 --> 58:18.034
...you need to deal with it and keep working.

58:18.035 --> 58:21.051
- Aren't we better off now than before?
- Yes.

58:21.052 --> 58:23.999
The truth is, I don't know if I can go on, 
my love.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
In life, we grow accustomed to
whatever comes our way, besides starving.

58:27.001 --> 58:30.001
I don't know...

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
...there's a limit to what one can bear.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.600
<i>I'll sing this corrido...</i>

58:52.900 --> 58:56.100
<i> ...to the two men that were killed,</i>

58:56.900 --> 59:02.100
<i>Without any compassion
they were cruely tortured, </i>

59:02.101 --> 59:04.801
Give me what you stole.
Gimme!

59:04.900 --> 59:07.100
<i> They were run over with a car...</i>

59:07.101 --> 59:09.101
You stole it!

59:18.800 --> 59:25.799
<i>In the neigborhood of El Palmito,
in the city of Culiancán,</i>

59:25.800 --> 59:32.834
<i> There went Francisco Lopez,
and Francisco Beltran,</i>

59:32.835 --> 59:41.000
<i> They couldn't have imagined
that they would be killed.</i>

59:44.300 --> 59:50.500
<i>Francisco Lopez had some bills to pay...</i>

59:51.300 --> 59:55.584
<i> He killed the one who stole his beloved,</i>

59:55.585 --> 01:00:01.226
<i>FAGGOT BITCHES
A REMINDER FROM THE KINGS OF THE NORTH</i>

01:00:01.227 --> 01:00:07.000
<i>But Francis Beltran was not guilty.</i>

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.684
<i>The next day they found him at dawn,</i>

01:00:28.685 --> 01:00:34.534
<i> They had their guts inside out
and a dog ate them, </i>

01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:37.999
Damn, Benny, you have the soul of a poet.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.334
<i> A few moments later the police arrived.</i>

01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:42.500
I baptize you with the name of "La Gringa".

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.000
In the name of the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.599
<i>With a band, the people of Sinaloa
were burying them,</i>

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.800
<i> and two mothers were crying
without consolation,</i>

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:12.800
<i> Because their beloved children
are now in heaven.</i>

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.500
What did he say?

01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:30.100
He said that he'll give us everything for $ 75,000.

01:01:30.435 --> 01:01:32.934
- Including the grenades and bazooka.
- Everything?

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.951
Then, go ahead and tell him "yes".
Let's go, come on.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:36.899
Let's take everything.

01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:53.100
Ladies and gentlemen, social justice...

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.000
...was, is and always will be 
the eternal debt we owe to our Mexico.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.334
Today, we gather in celebration of
the bicentenary of independence...

01:02:04.335 --> 01:02:09.101
...and the centennial of the revolution,
events that gave us a proud homeland.

01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:14.985
And thanks to the enormous generosity
of Don Jose and Doña Mari Reyes...

01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:18.834
...who, with the big heart and patriotism 
that God gave them...

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:22.000
...have donated this wonderful school
for our city.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.334
The whole community 
of San Miguel the Archangel.

01:02:25.335 --> 01:02:27.799
But most of all, Mexican children...

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.834
...who are the future of our country,
will be eternally grateful.

01:02:33.835 --> 01:02:37.000
God bless you, Señores Reyes.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.000
What do you think of the new
Heroes of the Fatherland, Cochi?

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800
And now to conclude this solemn event...

01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:02.600
...we will respectfully sing our national anthem.

01:03:02.835 --> 01:03:06.851
<i> Mexicans, to the cry of war...</i>

01:03:06.852 --> 01:03:11.000
<i> ...lend your swords and bridle... </i>

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.000
<i> ...and let the earth tremble at its center...</i>

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.000
<i> ...the roaring sound of the cannon.</i>

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.000
- How's it going, Tex?
- How are you, Cochi?

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.799
How's life treating you?

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.000
As the saying goes,
struggling, but with my claws out.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.799
- And you?
- I'm well.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.834
Is it all here, or do I have to count it?

01:04:02.835 --> 01:04:05.799
Have I ever disappointed you, Cochi?

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800
I've always brought you
high quality merchandise.

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:09.800
Let me see,
I'll give it the test.

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.102
Go on, son.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.000
Very good.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.000
- And the opium?
- Look, my dear Cochi.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.500
I'll give you a good piece of advice as a friend.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.800
To trust is good, but not to trust is better.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.500
You haven’t changed over all these years.
Benny, give the man his money.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.000
Looks okay.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.500
Take this, little one.
Hold on to the money for me.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.500
Hey, unload the mechandise!

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.500
My man, Cochi.

01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:58.501
Always a pleasure doing business 
with you, Tex.

01:04:58.502 --> 01:05:01.000
Good to see you, so long.
Let's go, little guy.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.000
Take a look at the quality of the shit 
Tex sells to us.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.100
Who is this guy?
Is he really a gringo?

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.434
He wa born in Brownsville but
his parents are from Reynosa.

01:05:20.435 --> 01:05:22.099
The guy thinks he's a gringo...

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.134
...but he's as Mexican as a cactus.

01:05:24.135 --> 01:05:28.951
- All that dough goes straight to him?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:05:28.952 --> 01:05:32.600
The Texan is what we call in the business
a middleman, a coyote.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.434
He spends months in the mountains
buying crops from the peasants.

01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:41.434
He buys their poppy and coca and sells it 
to the boss at 10 times its price.

01:05:41.435 --> 01:05:44.951
All the problems in the countryside
would be solved if...

01:05:44.952 --> 01:05:48.600
...it weren't for the fucking asshole intermediaries.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.600
What's up with this idiot?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.365
- Good afternoon, "my friends".
- What's going on Mendoza?

01:06:12.366 --> 01:06:14.934
- Why's the road closed?
- It just came in that we had...

01:06:14.935 --> 01:06:18.600
...a 3-18 on kilometer 20, 
the highway is closed.

01:06:18.935 --> 01:06:20.865
3-18, my ass, cut the bullshit
and let us through, you prick.

01:06:20.866 --> 01:06:23.034
Let's go, we're in a hurry.

01:06:23.035 --> 01:06:24.899
I'm really sorry, Cochi.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.934
A bus flipped over and it was ugly,
it'll be closed for several hours.

01:06:28.935 --> 01:06:30.899
Why not cut through that cactus field?

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.100
Cactus field, you motherfucker!

01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:35.800
You fucking pricks...

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.000
Sorry Cochi...
Orders are orders.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:05.000
Watch out Benny, they're Panchos!
Get cover!

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.000
Follow that asshole, Benny. 
Don’t let the bastard escape.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.500
Don’t kill me!
I'll give you anything to spare me.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.500
Don't do it!
Give me a chance, man.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.000
Damn, Benny.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.000
I couldn't have done it better.
Look what you did to him.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.334
I thought you didn't have the balls 
for this gig.

01:08:15.335 --> 01:08:18.500
Respect, cabrón!

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.000
We must give thanks to God
for things turned out well.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.334
This merchandise was already
promised to the gringos.

01:08:27.335 --> 01:08:29.299
And we couldn't disappoint them.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.334
Now you really showed what balls you have.

01:08:32.335 --> 01:08:34.299
Thank you, Boss.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.334
If not for my fucking jealous brother, that cunt.

01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:40.299
But now the tide's turning, eh?

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.800
I think if we don’t stop uncle Francisco...

01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:44.334
...things could get worse.

01:08:44.335 --> 01:08:47.399
Yes, my son.
That's why I'll send...

01:08:47.401 --> 01:08:49.500
...him the bodies of my nephews.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.799
That should give the fucker something 
to think about.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.834
How's that, you fucking pussy Pancha?
Who's the bitch now, asshole?

01:08:55.835 --> 01:08:58.799
Enough J.R.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.800
Don’t disturb your cousins.

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:03.100
In memory of your grandmother,
show some respect for the family.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.000
And you guys, to show you how happy I am.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.799
Here you go.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.800
And don’t be stupid, don’t spend...

01:09:14.801 --> 01:09:16.800
...it all on the first thing you see!

01:09:16.835 --> 01:09:19.399
Do go around boasting like big shots.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:22.834
Don’t worry, Boss, and again, thank you.

01:09:22.835 --> 01:09:25.000
Thank you, Sir.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.000
Come, my son, I'll teach you
to classify the goods.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.600
Benny, now what?

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.600
- Hey, Ma.
- Did you win the lottery?

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.100
How are you?
Here it is, as promised.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.400
I've been thinking of you,
look what I brought.

01:10:11.401 --> 01:10:13.434
It's a TV for you to watch your soaps.

01:10:13.435 --> 01:10:15.600
So you can esapce this awful reality.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.600
How lovely, thank you, my son.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.934
Let me see here.

01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:23.899
This is for you.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.434
Now you're following the same steps
as you brother, am I right?

01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:29.899
No, Ma, why do you say that?

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.434
With the way you look, 
it couldn't be anything else.

01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:36.934
But it's up to you. Just don't give me
as much grief as your brother did, okay?

01:10:36.935 --> 01:10:39.951
- Don’t worry, Ma.
- Come in, son.

01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:42.899
No mother, I have to get back to work.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.100
And what about your watch?
Won't you give it to me as a present?

01:10:46.935 --> 01:10:50.100
Why, of course, Ma.
You only needed to ask.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.100
Okay, I'll be back to visit you.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.400
Wait.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.899
I forgot one thing.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.934
Oh yeah!
I forget to get your blessing, Ma.

01:11:03.935 --> 01:11:05.899
No, no. Forget the stupid blessing.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.934
The neighbor's son bought her a "watsman."

01:11:09.935 --> 01:11:11.899
You'd be able to get me one, right?

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.934
Sure mom, I'll bring you one
with an MP3 and everything.

01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:19.100
Oh, great.
Now lean forward for your blessing.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.100
See you soon, Ma.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.800
What do you think?

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.634
- Come on, come and check it out.
- It's ours?

01:11:56.635 --> 01:11:58.599
Yes.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.800
- Hello, my queen.
- It's beautiful, my love.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.800
Go on in and fix yourself up.
Let's go celebrate.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.000
- You like it, son?
- Yeah, man.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.000
Let go. It's getting late.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.834
What are we doing here?
I don’t like this place.

01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:34.000
Come on, my love, it's a surprise.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.799
<i> In memory of Pedro Garcia.
"El Devil"</i>

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.300
<i> Remembered fondly by
his brother Benny, </i>

01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:53.600
<i>his wife Lupita, and
his son Benjamin. </i>

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.500
<i> Rest in peace</i>

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.834
My God, honey.
You'll go to heaven for doing this.

01:13:07.835 --> 01:13:10.000
Wait, it gets better.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.900
<i> He was a brave man indeed. </i>

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.400
<i> He always mocked the police. </i>

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.400
<i>Thousands were at his command. </i>

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.400
<i> They all knew him as "El Diablo." </i>

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.834
<i> Money, power and fame. </i>

01:13:48.835 --> 01:13:51.799
Hey son, good night.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.799
- Listen, Uncle Benny.
- What is it?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.000
I just wanted to thank you 
for what you did for my Pa.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.000
Well, he was my brother.
And I really loved him.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.500
Uncle Benny, could I ask a favor?

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.299
When I'm killed, if you're still alive...

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.334
...could you build me a tomb 
with a nice song like my father's?

01:14:14.335 --> 01:14:17.334
Stop talking bullshit, son.
When you get killed?

01:14:17.335 --> 01:14:20.334
On my watch, you will live a straight life.

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:23.500
Whatever it takes.
Until tomorrow, my son.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.334
My love, I swear this was one of the best days 
of my life.

01:14:32.335 --> 01:14:34.500
Oh yeah?

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:38.334
I still have something else for you.

01:14:38.335 --> 01:14:41.500
- Oh really?
- Look.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.299
Give this money to Don Camilo.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.334
And tomorrow you quit Salon Mexico, 
what do you think?

01:14:48.335 --> 01:14:50.299
My love, this is so much money.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.334
Shouldn't we wait a little longer?

01:14:53.335 --> 01:14:55.351
Of course not, my queen.

01:14:55.352 --> 01:14:57.299
There will be plenty more 
where that came from.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.334
My future wife won't remain as a whore.

01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:02.500
Who ever heard of such a monstrosity?

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:11.500
Godson, you've made my dreams come true.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.299
And I was always doubting you.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.299
That's the least I can do for you, Godfather.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.900
When I get some more money together...

01:15:18.901 --> 01:15:20.800
...we'll build a car wash, what do you think?

01:15:20.801 --> 01:15:24.300
Great idea! Hey, and your wife and nephew, 
how are they?

01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:27.000
I haven't seen them in a while.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.400
Speaking of the Queen of Rome...

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.900
What is it, beautiful?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.199
Don’t cry, my queen, stay there.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.199
Don't do anything,
I'm gonna race over there.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.400
- What is it, godson? Are you okay?
- I'll explain later.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.400
Now, we're just missing the customers.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.400
And then when Don Camilo arrived...

01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:53.400
...I gave him the cash, but he said no.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.899
That it wasn't enough, that I still owed interest.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.400
And that I was one of his best girls...

01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:02.100
...and he would not let me go 
with just any pimp.

01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:05.399
Pimp?
That's what he said?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.399
And not only that. 
Then that pig tried to hit me.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:13.600
If the girls were not there to hold him, 
he'd have killed me.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.600
Don’t worry, beautiful,
I'm gonna have a little talk with this guy.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.100
Can't you see it's closed, idiots?!

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.000
I'm coming!

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.000
You motherfucking bastard,
cocksucking asshole.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.000
Son of a bitch!

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.799
Let me go!
Let me at him!

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.000
Son of a bitch, you asshole.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.000
Benny! Wait!
I have a better idea.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.000
- Oh shit!
- You'll learn about respect.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.600
Shut up, you cunt!
Keep quiet, Don Camilo.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.800
You have to learn to respect the
ladies, cabrón.

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.500
Ready? Go.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.300
Benny, remember how the news is
always saying...

01:17:28.301 --> 01:17:30.300
...that these nightclubs are a safety hazard?

01:17:30.335 --> 01:17:33.851
- Yeah.
- Well, they were right.

01:17:33.852 --> 01:17:37.500
- Oh! Son of a bitch!
- Let's go!

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:46.000
<i>The time has come, dear, for
the soul to speak without lies.</i>

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.299
- Good morning, my love.
- Good morning.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.299
- You'll never guess what happened.
- What?

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.334
Gloria came by earlier and said that
the Panchos torched the Salon Mexico.

01:17:58.335 --> 01:18:01.299
- Don’t tell me?
- Yes, I'm telling you.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.300
Don Camilo was found burned to a crisp.

01:18:03.301 --> 01:18:05.299
They only recognized him by his gold tooth.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.300
Those fucking Panchos are assholes.

01:18:07.301 --> 01:18:10.100
They didn't even leave me time
to talk with your boss.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.000
There's Cochi.
I've got to run.

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:17.000
With this job, you're always on call.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.000
- Thank you, my love.
- No problem.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.800
Look at him, sleeping like a little angel.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.000
Son of a bitch!
Now you're gonna see, you fuck!

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.799
Let's go!

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.799
What's going on, Cochi?
We're buddies.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.000
Buddies, my balls!
Don't even speak to me, you asshole!

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.834
You drive, Benny, while I teach this fucker
a lesson.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:56.799
Let's go!

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.000
Sending us through the cactus field, eh?

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.000
Okay, Mendoza, how much did the Panchos
offer you, huh?

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.799
I swear they didn't, Cochi.
I swear on my blessed mother's soul.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.000
Don’t play the fucking fool, tell me
or I'll put a hole in you, cabrón.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.834
It really wasn't me, Cochi.

01:19:19.835 --> 01:19:21.851
Have mercy on me.

01:19:21.852 --> 01:19:24.000
Remember my kids.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.500
And did you remember mine, cabrón?

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.799
Don’t be stupid, Mendoza.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.000
If you tell Cochi the truth,
maybe I can help you.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.799
Thank you.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.834
I know you're a good guy at heart.

01:19:43.835 --> 01:19:46.500
But tell Cochi not to kill me.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.000
Then answer his question.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.799
6000 pesos.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.000
That's all the Panchos paid you, fucker?!

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.100
It's more than we earn in
in a month at the station.

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.100
Think, Benny. 3000 pesos per head.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:09.100
They must be joking.
That's it! Fucking kill him!

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.899
Come here, cabrón.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.934
You know what happens to snitches?

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.800
Eh?

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.800
No, Garcia!
Please, I'm begging you, Garcia.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.299
I can't do it, Cochi.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.834
Fuck, Benny. You're missing out
on the best part of the job.

01:20:30.835 --> 01:20:32.400
No!

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.300
See?

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.300
You know what I realized Benny?

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.300
As singer Jose Alfredo said...

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.300
"Life is worth nothing".

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.300
For 3000 fucking pesos.

01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:59.400
That's fucker almost sent us to our graves.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.500
Tell me the truth, Cochi.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.500
Don’t you feel anything, 
just killing someone like that?

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.999
I mean...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.999
...aren't you afraid you'll end up in hell?

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.500
Hell, my fucking ass.
Hell is right here where we are.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.034
Don't you remember what it was like
when we were kids?

01:21:22.035 --> 01:21:24.999
How hungry we were? The fucking cold?
The miserable poverty that we lived in?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.034
Or like right now, when guys
are killing each other just for the sake of it.

01:21:29.035 --> 01:21:32.200
Only because they can't find a
decent way to live.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.500
I'm telling you, this life we're living
is fucking hell.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.200
Yeah, you're right.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.500
What's up Cochi? 
Won't you give me a ride home?

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.000
No, we're going to my house
so you get to know my wife.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.434
You know what? I'm still feeling a little sick 
to my stomach, just look at me.

01:22:06.435 --> 01:22:10.034
Exactly, have a beer and meet my old lady.

01:22:10.035 --> 01:22:11.600
Come on.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.299
Come on family!

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.334
All in single file, ok?

01:22:21.335 --> 01:22:23.334
Let's say hello to Uncle Benny.

01:22:23.335 --> 01:22:24.999
Come on.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.200
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.200
This is Baby Bear, this is Princess,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.200
Shorty, the Mariachi.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:40.534
And my favorite, my firstborn, the Cochiloquinho.

01:22:40.535 --> 01:22:42.199
Look.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.734
Here's the future of all my futures.

01:22:44.735 --> 01:22:46.199
Benny.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.234
Cochi, Ah!
Señora, very pleased to meet you.

01:22:49.235 --> 01:22:51.199
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go!

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.199
- Up to bed, all of you.
- Good night.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.234
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:22:56.235 --> 01:22:59.000
Good night Baby Bear.
They are wonderful.

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.900
Let's have a drink.
Come on.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.200
Make yourself at home,
Benny, what will it be?

01:23:05.201 --> 01:23:07.300
Anything.

01:23:07.335 --> 01:23:09.400
Let me see.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.400
Salud compadre.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.000
You have to see it to believe it, Cochi.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.000
One thing is one thing and
anyother thing is another thing, Benny.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.799
What did you think?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.000
That I lived in a cave
and ate human flesh?

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.299
No, but... to see you...

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.800
Don’t misunderstand me, Cochi, but...

01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:38.100
...it's like you are two different people at once.

01:23:38.335 --> 01:23:41.299
Well, you see, if I wasn't in the Narco business,

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:44.334
How else would I support my children?

01:23:44.335 --> 01:23:47.500
I do this because there's no
no other choice.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.000
There's no question about that.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.299
The boss is pissed off at you.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.300
The very least he'll do is decapitate you...

01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:04.299
Listen up! You sons of bitches!

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.500
On your knees!
Hands on your head.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.500
Don't try anything stupid!

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.834
Now what's the problem with this idiot?

01:24:18.835 --> 01:24:21.000
We're screwed, Cochi.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.399
As I was telling you, Captain.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.000
The arrest of these dangerous drug traffickers...

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.600
...is a demonstration that the collaboration
between the three levels of government...

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.899
...is working very well.

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.700
And the struggle being undertaken by...

01:24:37.701 --> 01:24:39.934
...the President of the Republic
against organized crime...

01:24:39.935 --> 01:24:41.899
...is on the right path.

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.900
And now yes, even though
it doesn't look like it, we're winning.

01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:46.900
Chief Mancera...

01:24:46.901 --> 01:24:48.900
...head of our heroic police force...

01:24:48.935 --> 01:24:52.100
...will give you the details on these little gems.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:57.100
Okay, Captain, first we have
Eugenio Matta. Alias: El Cochiloco.

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.900
He is considered the head of operations
of the cartel and he's the main...

01:24:59.901 --> 01:25:02.500
...distributor of drugs in the region.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.934
And here we have Benjamin Garcia.

01:25:04.935 --> 01:25:06.899
Better known as El Benny.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:08.900
For many years he's been importing and...

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:10.900
...exporting prohibited substances.

01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:14.934
He belongs to a network of traffickers in the U.S.

01:25:14.935 --> 01:25:18.100
- Then we...
- Hold on, Chief.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.899
Do you have any evidence to sustain the charges?

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.934
Because you make it sound like you have
the most dangerous gangsters in the country.

01:25:23.935 --> 01:25:26.951
As you know, Captain, these types of offenders...

01:25:26.952 --> 01:25:29.899
...have many resources, prominent lawyers...

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:32.899
...who help them... so...
- Yes, yes I understand.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.934
Could you give me permission to speak alone 
with the inmates please.

01:25:35.935 --> 01:25:38.100
Yes, yes of course.
Mancera.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.500
So fellas...

01:25:48.301 --> 01:25:50.301
I understand that you guys
are more dangerous...

01:25:50.302 --> 01:25:52.502
...than "El Chapo" and "Los Aretes" put together.

01:25:55.801 --> 01:25:57.799
Look here, cabrones.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.799
What really interests me most are the Reyes.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.834
They say you four are working for Don Jose.

01:26:03.835 --> 01:26:06.851
So now, I know that
you won't tell me anything now...

01:26:06.852 --> 01:26:09.834
...but I'm making you an offer anyway.

01:26:09.835 --> 01:26:13.000
Don’t laugh!
You never know.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.799
Come on, Captain.
Let's hear it.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.799
Don't beat around the bush,
what's your offer?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.834
We have an attractive witness protection program...

01:26:22.835 --> 01:26:27.000
...copied from the American model 
that works very well.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.834
If any of you want to "sing"
for whatever reason...

01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:32.799
...talk to me.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.000
I'm offering freedom and protection...

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.000
...in exchange for testimony against the Reyes.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.000
What do you think about it?

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.834
Think about it.
You never know...

01:26:48.835 --> 01:26:51.834
Life takes many turns,
who knows what's best?

01:26:51.835 --> 01:26:55.000
Someday you might need this.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.500
Consider also that...

01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:03.600
...it's better to be a fifth-rate snitch
than a first-rate corpse.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.000
Excuse me.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.000
Fucking federales.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.500
You two are nothing more 
than a pair of ingrates.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.834
Have you forgotten who it was
that put you in your jobs?

01:27:30.835 --> 01:27:32.299
You worthless pieces of shit.

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.299
Especially you, Felix.

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.300
Do you remember how much I've given...

01:27:37.301 --> 01:27:39.334
...in your election campaign?

01:27:39.335 --> 01:27:42.334
It would have been better if I had run
for Mayor myself...

01:27:42.335 --> 01:27:44.265
...as my wife suggested.

01:27:44.266 --> 01:27:46.534
It's true, my love, you'd do much better as mayor 
than this little prick.

01:27:46.535 --> 01:27:48.299
Please understand, Don Jose...

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.300
The Federal Government
is putting us under pressure...

01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:52.400
...with the whole business of
combating organized crime.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:55.299
And... have you seen all the commercials on TV?

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:58.334
"The Federal Government works for you, 
in the fight against organized crime."

01:27:58.335 --> 01:28:01.351
"Even if it doesn't look like it,
we are winning."

01:28:01.352 --> 01:28:04.500
Shut up, Jesus. Stop making all that racket. 
You sound like a parrot.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.300
You're being a true asshole, Felix.

01:28:07.301 --> 01:28:09.300
The Federal Government can kiss my ass.

01:28:09.335 --> 01:28:11.351
Their campaign is only to deceive the people.

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:13.299
And to cover up for their own stealing.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:17.500
It's just that the federal agent who came
is in charge of the whole region, Don Jose.

01:28:17.801 --> 01:28:19.802
And, not only that, but he...

01:28:19.803 --> 01:28:22.003
...caught us with out pants down.
Right, compadre?

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.299
There is no other way to put it, Don Jose.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.500
And why not arrest my nephews 
or my fucking brother?

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.300
Didn't you hear that the other day
the tried to...

01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:33.300
...rob one of our shipments?

01:28:33.301 --> 01:28:35.301
But they fucked themselves over
because my guys...

01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:37.334
...are the most badass motherfuckers around.

01:28:37.335 --> 01:28:40.351
They fucked them up good and proper,
like real fucking men.

01:28:40.352 --> 01:28:43.360
- Isn't that right, cabrones?
- Yes, sir!

01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:46.299
So motherfuckers, which one of you two 
is turning crooked on me?

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:50.299
No, no, no, don’t think that, Don Jose, please.

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:53.299
It's just that your guys are crossing the line.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.800
The other day they picked up Officer Mendoza...

01:28:56.801 --> 01:28:59.100
...and he hasn't been seen since.

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.299
Stop being such a liar, Felix!

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.300
My guys don't even...

01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:05.334
...go to take a shit without my permission.

01:29:05.335 --> 01:29:07.299
It must have been the fucking Panchos.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.899
And neither you, nor you has done a thing 
to stop them.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.100
But Don Jose, this time it was just 
the Federal Police...

01:29:12.101 --> 01:29:14.200
...the next it will be the whole army.

01:29:14.335 --> 01:29:17.334
Are you really such a stupid prick?

01:29:17.335 --> 01:29:19.299
How many times do I have to repeat.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.334
They must have a little arrangement
with my colleagues in Sinaloa.

01:29:22.335 --> 01:29:25.334
They just want to make a little show
to look like they're putting up a fight.

01:29:25.335 --> 01:29:27.299
But listen to me.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.299
If you don’t want any bloodshed...

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.334
...do something about my brother. 
If not, you'll be hearing from me.

01:29:32.335 --> 01:29:34.299
Is that clear!?

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.334
Yes, I promise you that my colleague and I
will get right to work on it.

01:29:37.335 --> 01:29:39.500
- Right, Mancera?
- Yes, yes Don Jose.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.800
So cabrones...
Which of you...

01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:54.800
...whacked Mendoza without my permission?

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.500
No, no one.

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.834
What is it, beautiful?

01:30:04.835 --> 01:30:07.500
Oh Benny, I'm really worried about my son.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.500
I'll tell you a secret...

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.000
...but you've got to keep it to yourself.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.000
For some time now...

01:30:19.301 --> 01:30:23.500
...I've been dipping into a little
of the boss's money.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.800
And in a short time...

01:30:27.801 --> 01:30:30.300
...we'll have enough to get all three of us 
into the U.S.

01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:32.302
What do you think?

01:30:32.303 --> 01:30:34.303
Benny, you need to be careful.

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:36.302
If the Reyes catch you, they might kill you.

01:30:36.303 --> 01:30:40.503
I'm not a dummy, babe.
I'm keeping it well hidden.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.799
Oh my love, may God grant it.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.000
I want us to get as far away from here as we can.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:54.800
<i>LITTLE BROTHER,  
THIS IS JUST SO YOU'LL SEE </i>

01:30:54.801 --> 01:30:58.500
<i>WHO HAS THE BIGGEST PAIR OF BALLS.
HERE COME THE PIG, A DICK WITH NO WIG...</i>

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.834
Di you see waht they wrote to me here?

01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:04.799
You probably can't read anyway, cabrones.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.834
This proves that you haven't got the balls.

01:31:07.835 --> 01:31:11.434
You can't handle this shit.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.834
My son is going to bring some guys 
from Reynosa who really have big balls.

01:31:14.835 --> 01:31:16.834
We'll see the look on you faces after that.

01:31:16.835 --> 01:31:18.799
This is fucking war, assholes.

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.300
I swear on my blessed mother's grave that...

01:31:21.301 --> 01:31:24.500
...I will murder my brother
and his whole fucking family.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.834
He's no relation of mine anymore!

01:31:26.835 --> 01:31:28.834
And take this shit down from there.

01:31:28.835 --> 01:31:30.965
Take this.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.600
Give $3000 dollars to each widow...

01:31:34.601 --> 01:31:36.734
...so that their men can be buried.

01:31:36.735 --> 01:31:39.000
Now!
Come on!

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.500
You heard my father, bunch of assholes.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.000
Well, take that thing down.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.434
I'm home, my beauty.

01:31:52.435 --> 01:31:54.434
Hello Benny, how did it go?

01:31:54.435 --> 01:31:57.600
Just fine, my love,
the boss is taking care of things.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.434
What happened my love?

01:32:00.435 --> 01:32:03.600
That damn son of mine did it again. 
He hasn't come home.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.600
Look what he's been keeping under his bed.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.434
I have a feeling that he's got into 
something serious.

01:32:11.435 --> 01:32:13.434
Do you think something's happend to him?

01:32:13.435 --> 01:32:16.600
No, my love,
We would have heard if something happened.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.100
Don’t worry that I'll go look for him.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.100
He'll have to listen to me.

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.899
Hey Benny, got any meth?

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.034
What? Do I look like a narco or something, 
you little prick?

01:32:49.035 --> 01:32:50.899
No, not that.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:54.100
Hey Cholo, you know anything 
about my nephew?

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.934
He's been missing since yesterday 
and his mother's worried to death.

01:32:57.935 --> 01:33:00.100
Tell me what you know
and I'll give you 10 bucks.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.934
I might remember something 
if I had some meth. Otherwise...

01:33:02.935 --> 01:33:04.934
You're underage, cabrón!

01:33:04.935 --> 01:33:07.065
I'm a big boy.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:11.934
Here. Knock yourself out.
Now spill it.

01:33:11.935 --> 01:33:14.899
The guy became good friends with
the Panchos in San Francisco.

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.934
He boasts all the time about
working with them.

01:33:17.935 --> 01:33:19.934
He's always got money and women.

01:33:19.935 --> 01:33:22.100
Damn kid.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.600
Hey, just don't tell him
I told you about this.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.899
Don’t worry, Cholo.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.899
If you see him, tell him 
to go straight home, okay?

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:33.400
Sure, Benny. And you know something?

01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:36.100
If you want a badass assistant,
I'll be at your service.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.000
What the fuck, kid?

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.500
Here, Diablito.

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.500
So that you learn. Go ahead.

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.300
You're mother is going crazy 
ooking for you everywhere...

01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:35.334
...and you're wasting your time with...

01:34:35.335 --> 01:34:37.734
- Come on, let's go.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

01:34:37.735 --> 01:34:39.800
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you...

01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:43.334
Look here, Benny, you little prick,
cut the bullshit or I'll drag you home.

01:34:43.335 --> 01:34:46.334
Leave Diablito in peace, cabrón.

01:34:46.335 --> 01:34:48.334
Are you gonna take on four of us?

01:34:48.335 --> 01:34:50.500
Take it easy, Pancho.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.000
He's my uncle, and he's cool.

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.434
If you say so.
Saved by the bell, pal.

01:34:57.435 --> 01:34:59.000
Let's go, Benny.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.800
Let your uncle give you your fucking bottle, 
Diablito.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Fucking thugs.

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.334
How are you, beautiful?

01:35:28.335 --> 01:35:30.299
Yes. He's with me.

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:33.500
Don't worry.
Kisses, my queen.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:39.000
Any idea who you're messing with, cabrón?

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.299
Are you an idiot, or what?

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.500
Or do you feel like a big shot,
acting like a fucking narco?

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.334
You have to think that this is not a joke.

01:35:48.335 --> 01:35:50.334
Think of your father.

01:35:50.335 --> 01:35:52.299
Or me.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.500
If I don’t get out of this business soon
I'm gonna end up dead just like your dad.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.300
What?

01:35:59.301 --> 01:36:02.501
Want to follow the tradition of this family 
full of fucking dumb pricks?

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.799
Listen up, cabrones.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.799
With these guys on our side,
we're really gonna fuck up my cousins.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.000
From now on, we'll work in three groups.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.834
You Garcia, you'll be partners with El Sargento.

01:36:22.835 --> 01:36:24.799
Yes sir.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.000
You Huasteco, you work with El Sardo.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.300
Cochiloco, since you're the one
my father finds most reliable...

01:36:30.301 --> 01:36:32.834
...you'll work with me.

01:36:32.835 --> 01:36:37.000
La Muñeca, and this guy they call of El Mayate 
will lend us a hand.

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.000
- Are we agreed?
- Yes sir.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.300
Pardon me, J.R., with you permission, 
wouldn't it be...

01:36:43.301 --> 01:36:45.834
...that La Muñeca and I could...

01:36:45.835 --> 01:36:47.799
Stop bitching, Huasteco.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.800
You'll soon have another opportunity...

01:36:49.801 --> 01:36:51.834
...to be reunited with your boyfriend.

01:36:51.835 --> 01:36:54.351
And you can get back to whatever 
you do together.

01:36:54.352 --> 01:36:56.834
But right now, you'll do what my son tells you.

01:36:56.835 --> 01:36:59.299
- Is that clear!?
- Yes, Boss.

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.334
So get a fuckin'move on, we don’t pay
you to stand around like pricks. Let's go!

01:37:02.335 --> 01:37:03.900
Come on!

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.799
- How was I, Pa?
- Well done, Son.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.800
Keep being a man like that...

01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:17.834
...and you'll make a worthy
heir to your father.

01:37:17.835 --> 01:37:19.499
Yes, Pa.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.000
Oh, if your grandmother were alive...

01:37:22.001 --> 01:37:24.534
...she'd be crying with joy.

01:37:24.535 --> 01:37:26.200
True.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.799
I'll tell you straight up.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.500
The owner of the car dealership
owes money to the Boss.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.000
Don Jose's orders are that we put a little fear 
into him to clear this up.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.000
- Any questions?
- Negative, whitey.

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.500
Come on then.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.500
You can stay here, I can
take care of this alone.

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.000
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.000
Finished.
Who's next?

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.000
- So fast?
- Affirmative.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.000
Hey, Sergeant, if you don't mind,
could you tell me how you did that?

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:37.500
Oh!
Fuck! Damn it!

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:50.500
- Cigarette, Sergeant?
- Negative.

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.299
How about a "beer"?

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.334
Back there is a "Cooler."
They're icy cold. Don’t you feel like one?

01:38:57.335 --> 01:38:59.300
No.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.600
You're not from around here,
right, "Sarge"?

01:39:01.601 --> 01:39:03.200
No.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.634
And if you don't mind, Sergeant, 
where's are you from?

01:39:07.635 --> 01:39:09.800
Oaxaca.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.599
And you were in the army?

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.634
Hey man, let's get things straight.
My name is Benito Juarez.

01:39:16.635 --> 01:39:19.599
And I like to be called
"Benemerito of the Americas."

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
And to make it even clearer...

01:39:21.601 --> 01:39:24.134
...I didn't leave the army
to go around making friends.

01:39:24.135 --> 01:39:27.400
I did it to make a shitload of cash.

01:39:27.635 --> 01:39:29.765
That's it. Affirmative?

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.834
Eh? And so we don't have any problems...

01:39:32.835 --> 01:39:35.799
...you can go on calling me Sergeant, or Sir.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.600
And quit that fucking gringo shit...

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.800
..."My Sarge" and all that shit.

01:39:40.835 --> 01:39:42.800
Is that clear, whitey?

01:39:42.801 --> 01:39:45.000
It's fine, Sergeant.

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:53.500
Hey, Cochi?
Already missing me?

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:58.334
Where are you!? 
Hold on Cochi, I'm on the way!

01:39:58.335 --> 01:40:01.299
Cochi!
Cochi!

01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:04.500
Something happened, whitey?

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.334
What happened Cochi?
Are you okay?

01:40:28.335 --> 01:40:31.334
The Panchos fucking did us in, Benny.

01:40:31.335 --> 01:40:34.100
We fucked up.

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.334
But how could they do this?

01:40:37.335 --> 01:40:39.299
What happened?

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:43.500
Some son of a bitch tipped them off
and so they caught us eating camote.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.500
I barely had time to react and
kill those ones over there...

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.500
But Don Francisco and those little pricks escaped.

01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.700
Where is J.R.?

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:02.800
J.R. and La Muñeca are in there.

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:06.100
Go take a look at them.

01:41:33.835 --> 01:41:37.000
Apparently the boss's son
likes them young and tender.

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.400
Look how they left my nephew.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.700
We can't do anything, Sergeant.
We'll have to take him to the Boss.

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.400
Now we'll see what he's made of.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.199
Yeah.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.400
I'll fucking finish this garbage,
I promise you my son.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.000
I'll kill them like rats,
each and every one of your kids, Francisco!

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:07.100
Francisco, you son of a bitch!

01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.400
Tell me, damn it!
What was my son doing?

01:42:11.401 --> 01:42:13.934
Where were they!?

01:42:13.935 --> 01:42:16.934
They ambushed us on the highway, Boss.

01:42:16.935 --> 01:42:19.899
There were too many of them.

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.899
But I can say, from the bottom of my heart,
J.R. defended himself bravely.

01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.900
Bravely, my balls!

01:42:24.901 --> 01:42:26.934
You don’t think I didn't know my son?

01:42:26.935 --> 01:42:29.100
He was a gentle soul.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.934
But I pity you if you aren't telling me the truth.

01:42:33.935 --> 01:42:35.499
- Huasteco.
- Yes, Boss.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.200
Do you have enough weapons and ammunition...

01:42:37.201 --> 01:42:39.234
...to wipe out my brother?

01:42:39.235 --> 01:42:41.934
Yes Sir, the warehouse is full.

01:42:41.935 --> 01:42:44.100
They're fucked.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.599
Don Jose!

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.634
We just found out.
You can't imagine how much I regret this.

01:42:51.635 --> 01:42:53.599
My most sincere condolences.
Doña Mari

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.800
- Doña Mari, I'm so sorry.
- Shut up! Damn it!

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.799
What a tragedy.
My God.

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.834
This is a day of mourning
for all of San Miguel.

01:43:03.835 --> 01:43:06.799
For such a brilliant young man
to lose his life like this...

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.800
With a promising future in poltics.

01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:10.834
Shut up, you idiot!

01:43:10.835 --> 01:43:12.799
Yes, yes, forgive me.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.799
This will be a war, cabrones.

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.799
If my brother thinks
this is going to stop me...

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.834
...he's got another thing coming,
because I'm going to show him who's biggest.

01:43:20.835 --> 01:43:24.799
We must remain calm, Don Jose.
War isn't good for anyone.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.300
I pledge before you and our Lord...

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:29.834
...that I and Chief Mancera
will find who's responsible for this...

01:43:29.835 --> 01:43:33.834
...so that justice is done and
the death of his son is avenged.

01:43:33.835 --> 01:43:36.399
And what do you have to
say about this, Mancera?

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.834
Wasn't it your job to stop my nephews?

01:43:38.835 --> 01:43:41.799
- Investigations are...
- Idiot! You're to blame, asshole...

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.499
Nobody but you can take the blame
for my son death.

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:46.834
If you had listened to my husband,
this would never have happened.

01:43:46.835 --> 01:43:49.834
Doña Mari, sorry but you can't
blame it all on me.

01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:53.000
The problem is that your husband
has many enemies in the region.

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.299
Thank you, dear.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.500
You always read my mind.

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:16.500
And you Felix?
You have something to add?

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.300
Then go fuck yourself and find...

01:44:19.301 --> 01:44:21.834
...another police chief who has fucking balls 
for a change.

01:44:21.835 --> 01:44:23.399
Yes, sir.

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.600
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.799
And you!
You cabrón!

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.799
You and I have a lot to talk about, 
but in the meantime.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.300
Go screw yourself, and take this...

01:44:37.301 --> 01:44:39.834
...bunch of useless assholes with you.

01:44:39.835 --> 01:44:43.000
- Get the fuck out!
- Sir.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.834
Holy shit.

01:44:46.835 --> 01:44:49.000
Oh my love!

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.799
What happened, Uncle Benny?

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.934
Have you seen what your pals did?

01:44:58.935 --> 01:45:01.000
They Killed J.R. and La Muñeca.

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.334
Now let's see if you listen to me.

01:45:03.335 --> 01:45:06.334
Benny, you need to be careful.

01:45:06.335 --> 01:45:08.299
Something good may come of this.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.300
Don Jose swore he would finish off...

01:45:10.301 --> 01:45:12.334
...the Panchos, and I think he was serious.

01:45:12.335 --> 01:45:15.299
So, you stay inside...

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.299
...until things quiet down, It'll get pretty ugly.

01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.334
And there's gonna be a lot of blood.
I'm serious, cabrón.

01:45:21.335 --> 01:45:24.334
The ways of the Lord, as we all know...

01:45:24.335 --> 01:45:25.900
...are inscrutable.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.334
But there are certainties here on earth...

01:45:28.335 --> 01:45:30.335
...as in heaven that must comfort us...

01:45:30.336 --> 01:45:33.299
...even in moments of pain.

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:36.334
Who would imagine that
such a kind young man...

01:45:36.335 --> 01:45:39.351
...with a heart of gold as our dear Jesus... 

01:45:39.352 --> 01:45:42.500
...would find himself, like Christ,
with the Lord in heaven?

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.299
The sky, my children, is not only for the Saints...

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:49.334
...but also for men such as
our dear Jesus Reyes.

01:45:49.335 --> 01:45:52.500
Rest in peace, so be it.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.000
Revenge Lord.

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.400
Revenge is the only thing that I ask of you.

01:46:21.401 --> 01:46:24.399
And I don’t mean figuratively.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400
And just as you took him...

01:46:26.401 --> 01:46:30.600
...take all those motherfuckers
who stole him from me.

01:46:44.399 --> 01:46:46.799
You'll have to take care of my children, compadre.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.434
Let's see how life treats my poor orphans.

01:46:50.435 --> 01:46:53.651
Don’t think like that Cochi.

01:46:53.652 --> 01:46:55.265
Most likely nothing will happen.

01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.300
Don’t fuck around, Benny.

01:46:57.301 --> 01:46:59.500
You saw how the Boss
was looking at me.

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:04.500
You know what hurts me
most about leaving this life?

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.800
That I won't even get a chance to
meet your godson.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.600
Let me ask you one question.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.899
If Don Jose is going to declare
war on his brother.

01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:19.499
Who here is the most badass
motherfucker with guns?

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.900
Stop it man.
With all the money...

01:47:21.901 --> 01:47:23.934
...that the boss has,
he can bring in anyone he wants.

01:47:23.935 --> 01:47:26.100
From here all the way to Guanajuato.

01:47:26.901 --> 01:47:28.900
He'll never forgive me.

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:31.600
And he's right.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.800
Think positive, compadre.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.800
Your children need you.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.399
Cochi, Cochi.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.600
A dark-skinned guy who looks like
a soldier told me...

01:47:42.601 --> 01:47:44.899
...you need to get home fast.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.600
- Get lost!
- See?

01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.899
No, no!

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.100
No!
Cochiloquito.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.400
No.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.400
Cochiloquito.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.700
<i> JUST LIKE THAT, A SON FOR A SON, 
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.</i>

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:40.101
Take care of my wife,
and tell her I love her, Benny.

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:43.934
And I'll leave my kids to you.

01:48:43.935 --> 01:48:45.899
Yes, Cochi.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.899
What are you doing?

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.100
Justice, Benny, only justice.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.399
Let me go with you.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.600
No, this fight is between that
son of a bitch, Don Jose, and me.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.399
I told you, didn't I?

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.600
This fucking life is
nothing other than hell, Benny!

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:28.900
Sorry I'm late, but you know 
how the situation is.

01:49:28.901 --> 01:49:31.401
I had to do six other funerals.

01:49:31.402 --> 01:49:33.402
But, let us pray.
Our Father who art in heaven...

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.600
<i> Life is worth nothing, </i>

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.600
<i> Life is worthless,</i>

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.800
<i> It always starts with crying. </i>

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.800
<i> just as it ends with crying. </i>

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:56.800
<i> So that is why in this world.</i>

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.800
<i> Life is worth nothing. </i>

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.399
Listen up cabrones.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.600
After the disaster that occurred in this family...

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.400
...the only thing I want 
is to finish off that den of rats...

01:50:13.401 --> 01:50:15.700
...my brother and his children.

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.500
This is what I promised my son
when his corpse was here in front of me.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.834
And I will keep my promise!

01:50:23.835 --> 01:50:26.000
And you, fucking Benny!

01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.500
I know what's on your mind,
so you better lose the idea right now.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.834
Because your friend Cochiloco
was like a son to me.

01:50:32.835 --> 01:50:35.834
He was fucked over by the Panchos.

01:50:35.835 --> 01:50:38.000
Isn't that right?

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:41.334
And quit walking around with that
sad look on your faces.

01:50:41.335 --> 01:50:43.299
You don’t have any feelings.

01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:46.000
You're here only
for the fucking money.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.400
If you only knew what we would give
to have our son back.

01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:55.900
My whole fucking fortune.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.400
But as this is not possible...

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:02.900
...I have an offer for you.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.900
I'll give you $100,000 dollars...

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.400
...for the head of each asshole
who murdered my son.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.400
Do the math, cabrones.

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.900
Each one of you may take home more
than half a million dollars.

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.400
You've only dreamed of having that kind of money.

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:21.400
But I'll tell you one thing.

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.400
I want the heads of these motherfuckers.

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.200
And not just the heads of my nephews...

01:51:27.201 --> 01:51:29.400
...but also the head of my own brother.

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:31.700
I also want to head of an asshole...

01:51:31.701 --> 01:51:33.900
...that I think you know very well.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.699
The head of the man who betrayed us.

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.900
And for that, I'll give
$200,000 dollars more.

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:45.100
But one thing I warn you about...

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.900
...I pity the asshole who thinks I'm stupid...

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:49.934
...and tries to betray me.

01:51:49.935 --> 01:51:53.100
Beware, because this time 
I'll not only kill his child...

01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:57.600
...I'll chop up the whole family.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:00.100
Got it?

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:03.100
Come, my wife.

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.800
Boys.

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.600
When my husband says that we want...

01:52:11.601 --> 01:52:13.800
...the heads of my son's killers...

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:18.800
...it's not a figure of speech.
We really want their heads!

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.634
Listen up, white folks.
Don’t get me wrong.

01:52:31.635 --> 01:52:34.599
But I take it that you guys
are basically pussies.

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:37.800
I can't take the risk that
you'll do something stupid.

01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:42.134
So Sardo and I will carry out 
the boss's orders.

01:52:42.135 --> 01:52:45.134
It's enough for you to drive us 
to where we have to go...

01:52:45.135 --> 01:52:48.300
...tell us who we have to fucking kill.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.599
Affirmative?

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:55.634
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

01:52:55.635 --> 01:52:57.599
Fucking whities.

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.634
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

01:53:03.635 --> 01:53:05.800
Fucking pussies.

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.600
Sardo here said not to worry about 
your part of the money.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.834
Here's the office of Pancho Macana.
He's a bald guy...

01:53:27.835 --> 01:53:29.799
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.834
- Listen...
- He's a pretty tall guy...

01:53:31.835 --> 01:53:33.799
Hey!
Damn.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.334
What's wrong with these guys, Benny.

01:53:36.335 --> 01:53:39.000
To me it seems like they
must have been trained by the CIA.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:52.500
- This isn't them, Sergeant!
- God damn it!

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.000
Get out of here!

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.700
Where do you think you're going?

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.000
Let's move.
Go!

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.000
Come on.

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:56.000
Come on.

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:14.500
Are you sure that's all of them, man?

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:18.334
Sergeant, as I told you,
I know all the Panchos well.

01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:21.334
I've known them since Don Jose
worked with his brother.

01:55:21.335 --> 01:55:24.500
Only Don Francisco is left.

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:30.500
Okay, motherfucker.
You know you're already fucked.

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.299
But if you want to go without suffering...

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:36.334
...I'll give you three chances to
say who was snitch...

01:55:36.335 --> 01:55:39.500
...who told you where to find
the boss's son.

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.799
One...

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:43.834
Go to fucking hell, you cunt!

01:55:43.835 --> 01:55:45.500
Sardo.

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.799
Two.

01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:58.000
Go fuck your mother...

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:03.299
Three.

01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:06.299
Let's go, Panchito.

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.334
With your brother I was a nice guy.

01:56:09.335 --> 01:56:11.299
And I gave him three chances.

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:14.334
But to you, I'm gonna give only one chance.

01:56:14.335 --> 01:56:16.000
One.

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.000
Who was the snitch motherfucker.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.000
Ah! Okay! I'll tell you.

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.799
It was a guy from San Miguel.

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.000
That's better.
Nice and easygoing.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.000
And what is he called?

01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.799
I swear, I swear, I don’t know man.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.800
I just know that they called him Diablito.

01:56:45.801 --> 01:56:48.000
I swear I don’t know more than that.

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.600
<i> Speaking indigenous language. </i>

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.600
<i> Speaking indigenous language.
Diablito. </i>

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.600
So, whities, you are from San Miguel, 
aren't you?

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.934
Do you know anyone called Diablito?

01:57:10.935 --> 01:57:12.399
Nope.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.434
Really, I don't know, Sergeant.

01:57:14.435 --> 01:57:16.399
But it shouldn't be too hard to find out.

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.900
Let's fucking find the father...

01:57:18.901 --> 01:57:21.600
...to complete the Boss's mission.

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.600
Sardo, hand me the machetes to proceed.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:32.399
Hey, you two!

01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:35.434
I know I told you not to do anything...

01:57:35.435 --> 01:57:37.399
...but you're getting too lazy.

01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:40.500
Bring the bags here to carry the heads.

01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:50.100
Wait here, whities.

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:28.100
Okay, sons of bitches,
whoever moves gets fucking plugged.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.200
Stop right there, asshole!

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.399
Don Pancho Reyes.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:46.600
We brought some little gifts
from your brother.

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.700
Sons of fucking bitches!

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.500
<i>LEARN TO RESPECT THE KINGS
OF THE NORTH</i>

01:59:22.501 --> 01:59:24.700
<i> YOU SONS OF COCKS AND BITCHES </i>

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.200
Diablito.
Diablito.

01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:49.934
Listen to me, what did you say to the Panchos?

01:59:49.935 --> 01:59:51.899
- Nothing.
- Don't be stupid!

01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:56.934
It was you and only you who told Panchos 
where to find J.R.

01:59:56.935 --> 01:59:59.934
Behave like a man
and tell me the fucking truth.

01:59:59.935 --> 02:00:01.999
You know what guys like you are called?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.934
Snitch! Stoolie! Informer!
Double-crosser! Traitor! Rat!

02:00:06.935 --> 02:00:10.100
And if you didn’t know, this is
the worst fucking thing to be the world.

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:15.934
Tell me, what did they give you in return?
A gun? Money? Drugs? A car!?

02:00:16.435 --> 02:00:18.900
Why did you do this, my boy?

02:00:18.901 --> 02:00:20.934
Because J.R. and that son of a bitch Don Jose...

02:00:20.935 --> 02:00:23.934
...killed my father, that's why.

02:00:23.935 --> 02:00:26.451
Don’t talk bullshit.

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:28.899
Uncle Benny it's not bullshit.

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:31.934
I'm telling the truth, see!

02:00:31.935 --> 02:00:33.899
Where did you get this?

02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:36.300
One of the Panchos who worked with my father 
gave it to me.

02:00:36.301 --> 02:00:39.100
He had it because he was there
when my dad was killed.

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.834
Do you believe this story is true?

02:00:41.835 --> 02:00:43.799
Benny, I don’t know what to say.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.834
That medallion was what your brother 
loved most in life.

02:00:46.835 --> 02:00:50.000
But when he was killed,
he didn't have it on him

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.799
I'm going out for a moment.

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.799
I have to find out the truth.

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.899
And only one person can give me answers.

02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:00.099
No, don’t leave, don’t do anything crazy!

02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.400
Prepare a bag for my nephew
and don’t open the door...

02:01:02.401 --> 02:01:04.300
...for anyone until I return.

02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:15.901
- Who the hell is it?
- It's me, Huasteco, El Benny.

02:01:15.902 --> 02:01:17.600
Open up.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.399
What's happening Benny?

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.600
What's biting you ass so much that
you come at this hour? Come in.

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.600
Sit.

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:37.799
What is it?

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.000
- You want a Tequila?
- No, Huasteco.

02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:45.000
I'm here because there is something
that is just burning me up inside.

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.600
What is it Benny?

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:52.100
Huasteco, I want you to tell me the truth.

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.399
Who the fuck killed my brother?

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.900
Didn't Cochiloco tell you? 
May God rest his soul.

02:01:57.901 --> 02:02:00.934
Stop rocking the boat and
go back to your bed.

02:02:00.935 --> 02:02:02.899
Don’t play the fucking fool.

02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:05.100
Look what I found, you prick.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:09.934
I warn that I will not leave here
until I find out the truth...

02:02:09.935 --> 02:02:13.100
...or put a bullet into you.
You choose.

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:19.600
- You really want to know?
- Down to the last detail, cabrón.

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.399
See Benny...

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.434
Your little brother was a really cool guy...

02:02:25.435 --> 02:02:27.600
...but one day he seriously crossed the line.

02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:31.100
And Don Jose and J.R. were not pleased. 
They wouldn't forgive him.

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:33.600
You and Cochi knew it all along.

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.600
We not only knew, but we were also there 
when it happened.

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:42.434
And how did they kill my brother,
those sons of bitches?

02:02:42.435 --> 02:02:44.951
Come on, man.
Stop putting yourself through this shit.

02:02:44.952 --> 02:02:47.710
What do you want, to know everything?

02:02:47.711 --> 02:02:50.600
That's up to me, cabrón.

02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.900
Well, since you're insisting,
I'll tell you the whole truth.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.600
The Reyes killed your brother 
worse than a dog.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:03.100
You remember the Cockroach, right?

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.399
It was just like that...

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:08.600
...but with your brother, instead of his tongue.

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.600
Don Jose cut off his balls.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.834
What did my brother do for them
to kill him like that?

02:03:16.835 --> 02:03:19.000
It was your brother's own fault, Benny.

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.834
He was actually fucking around 
with none other than...

02:03:21.835 --> 02:03:24.000
...Doña Mari.

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.899
The boss's own wife.

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.100
- Doña Mari?
- And not only once, eh?

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.600
Goddamn Diablo.

02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:37.900
Your brother was a real piece of work.

02:03:37.901 --> 02:03:39.900
I don’t think there was anyone's wife...

02:03:39.901 --> 02:03:42.900
...who had not spent the night in his bed.

02:03:42.901 --> 02:03:47.101
Let's hope the Diablito
doesn't turn out the same.

02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:50.600
What did you call my nephew?

02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:55.000
They call him Diablito, don't they?

02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.300
You were going turn on me, weren't you?

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:04.000
Don’t kill me, man.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.500
I wouldn't say anything.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.200
You're not like the Reyes,
to kill me like a dog.

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.600
You're right, Huasteco.

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:23.100
But I'm not taking any risks, cabrón.

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.800
How's it going, babe? Is everything okay?

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.800
Sure?
Nothing happened?

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.800
Okay, I'm on my way.

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.800
You'll be alright there, Huasteco?

02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.434
Take this cash, son.

02:04:59.435 --> 02:05:01.600
I'll send you more later, ok?

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.100
Damn, get down!

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.034
How is it Benny, where are you going?

02:05:15.035 --> 02:05:17.534
How's it going, Amaya?
Don't tell me it's another 3-18?

02:05:17.535 --> 02:05:19.499
Let me through.

02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.600
You surprise me, Benny.
I have orders from the boss.

02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:24.034
No one is to leave San Miguel.

02:05:24.035 --> 02:05:25.499
Cut me a break.

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.534
Benny, you know things are bad.

02:05:27.535 --> 02:05:30.499
What is that?
Who's there?

02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.700
Get out of the truck, I have to check...

02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:36.700
- You killed him Uncle Benny.
- I had no choice, my boy. Hold on.

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.000
Come on, son. It's time.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.034
Don’t forget what I said.

02:05:57.035 --> 02:05:59.034
Remember what I told you?
When you get to Nogales.

02:05:59.035 --> 02:06:00.999
Oh, not again...

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I go to Rancho Grande and ask for...

02:06:03.001 --> 02:06:05.034
...Gordo Lopez and say that you sent me.

02:06:05.035 --> 02:06:07.051
He'll help me through to the other side.

02:06:07.052 --> 02:06:09.634
When I arrive in Phoenix,
I call the number you gave me.

02:06:09.635 --> 02:06:11.699
That's right. You're not as dumb...

02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.900
...as the rest of us Garcias, are you?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.200
Take good care of the money.
Those polleros are greedy bastards.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.200
Here we are.

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.965
I love you a lot, uncle.

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:36.000
Sorry for the trouble I caused you.

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:38.299
You are a pretty cool kid.

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:41.000
Just stop doing stupid shit.
Get going.

02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.334
Take good care of my mother, like I would.

02:06:43.335 --> 02:06:45.500
Hold on.

02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:50.100
Take this.

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:55.100
Go.

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:25.934
Everything's fine, my love.
No, he didn't cry. He's a Garcia.

02:07:25.935 --> 02:07:27.934
Yes, yes I'm going to be there, my love.

02:07:27.935 --> 02:07:30.100
What!?

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:33.600
When did those assholes get there?

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.834
Hey babe, get out of the house
and leave San Miguel.

02:07:38.835 --> 02:07:40.799
Get help from my Godfather.

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:44.500
Yes, yes, yes.
Take the phone and call me.

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.834
Yes.
Yes, my love.

02:07:46.835 --> 02:07:49.000
I love you, too.

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:52.000
Fuck...

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:02.799
Damn.

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.799
<i> FEDERAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE</i>

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:15.000
Okay, now...

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.334
How can I help you?

02:08:17.335 --> 02:08:19.500
Remember me, Captain?

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:21.799
Sure, you're Cochiloco, right?

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:24.834
No, that was my friend,
may he rest in peace.

02:08:24.835 --> 02:08:26.851
They call me Benny.

02:08:26.852 --> 02:08:29.000
I'm Benny Garcia

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.834
And how are things in San Miguel?

02:08:31.835 --> 02:08:33.851
Still boiling?

02:08:33.852 --> 02:08:35.860
It gets worse all the time.

02:08:35.861 --> 02:08:37.799
So here I am.

02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.334
Remember the offer that you made?

02:08:40.335 --> 02:08:42.834
Of course.
Have you brought me something good, Benny?

02:08:42.835 --> 02:08:45.000
Nothing less than...

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:48.000
...all the details about the life and times of
Don Jose Reyes.

02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:52.000
- Interested?
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.799
Yes, absolutely yes.
Of course.

02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:57.000
You have seen that the policy of our President...

02:08:57.001 --> 02:08:58.834
...is to convert Mexico into a country of snitches.

02:08:58.835 --> 02:09:02.000
And as you know,
I'd make it worth your while.

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.500
Thank you, Captain.

02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:10.834
Lopez, prepare the cage, we have a canary.

02:09:10.835 --> 02:09:12.799
And so, Captain...

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.000
In one night, we killed eight men.

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.834
In the few months I worked with Don Jose...

02:09:21.835 --> 02:09:25.000
...the guy must have whacked about 40 people.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.000
- How long has it been?
- About two and a half hours.

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:34.334
Check it over.

02:09:34.335 --> 02:09:37.299
Very good Benny.
Excellent.

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:39.500
It's great that you have
such a good memory.

02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.500
- Would you like another coffee?
- No, no, I'm pretty nervous.

02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.299
Captain, it's okay.
Shall we continue?

02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:49.334
No, with what we already have,
we can lock up Reyes for the rest of his life.

02:09:49.335 --> 02:09:52.334
Wait outside.

02:09:52.335 --> 02:09:54.299
So now I can leave, Captain?

02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:56.300
No, let me make a call to my boss...

02:09:56.301 --> 02:09:58.334
...and fill out some paperwork.

02:09:58.335 --> 02:10:00.000
You don’t want me to wait outside?

02:10:00.001 --> 02:10:01.800
This is just routine procedure.

02:10:01.835 --> 02:10:04.500
- In a hurry?
- Yes, yes indeed.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:09.334
Señor Reyes?
Good evening.

02:10:09.335 --> 02:10:10.699
Ramirez, from the Federal Police.

02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:13.900
Listen, I think I have something
that may interest you.

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.400
Do you know someone by the name of
Benjamin Garcia?

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:26.400
Where is Diablito, cabrón!

02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.100
Garcia.

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:52.499
Garcia!

02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.499
Don’t play dumb.

02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:57.700
Tell us where the boy is and you'll
save yourself all this suffering.

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.799
Take him out, I don't want him dying here.

02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:15.000
Don Jose wants him alive and kicking.

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:18.834
When you see him,
tell him I'll be there with the tapes.

02:11:18.835 --> 02:11:21.000
Yes, Captain.

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.000
It's a shame, isn't it?
He was good a good snitch.

02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:30.299
Hey cabrón.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:33.334
How much are they offering for your nephew?

02:11:33.335 --> 02:11:35.351
$200,000 dollars.

02:11:35.352 --> 02:11:37.299
Holy shit!

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:39.500
What I would do with all that money.

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:46.334
If you don't mind my asking,
how much are you guys getting for...

02:11:46.335 --> 02:11:48.334
...delivering me to Don Jose?

02:11:48.335 --> 02:11:50.299
Only 5000 pesos.

02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:52.500
5000 pesos... Shit...

02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:56.500
Your boss will be getting
about $50,000 dollars.

02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.299
Seriously, cabrón?

02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:03.334
Cut the shit. You really believe this guy?

02:12:03.335 --> 02:12:06.399
No, I don’t know but...

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.334
I've seen that narcos operate at a different 
economic scale.

02:12:10.335 --> 02:12:12.299
It's true.

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:13.816
There's more:

02:12:13.817 --> 02:12:18.500
If you let me go,
I give you each $50,000 dollars...

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:22.500
...and I'll throw in a kilo of cocaine.

02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:26.065
Okay.

02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:29.900
But no funny business...

02:12:29.901 --> 02:12:31.534
...or I'll put a fucking bullet in you.

02:12:31.535 --> 02:12:33.100
Chief...

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:39.900
Right here.
Right here.

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.900
You just have to untie me to get the money.

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:44.900
Let him go.

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.734
Didn't I tell you these narcos
are really eccentric?

02:12:55.735 --> 02:12:57.099
Yes.

02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:58.834
Look at that tomb.

02:12:58.835 --> 02:13:00.851
Give me a hand, boss.

02:13:00.852 --> 02:13:03.000
I'll watch him.

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:16.799
We're set for life, partner.

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.300
Hey, come on. We agreed on
$50,000 and a kilo of coke.

02:13:19.301 --> 02:13:21.734
It's my life savings, man.

02:13:21.735 --> 02:13:24.417
Sorry, cabrón. They say you never know
who you're working for.

02:13:24.452 --> 02:13:26.610
You're screwed.

02:13:26.611 --> 02:13:29.000
Come on, partner.

02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:42.334
Holy shit, man.
I think he died.

02:13:42.335 --> 02:13:44.851
And now?
What the hell do we do?

02:13:44.852 --> 02:13:47.500
Bury him and get out of here, right?

02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:53.000
Holy shit, godson!

02:14:53.835 --> 02:14:55.700
What happened to you?

02:14:55.701 --> 02:14:57.901
I'll tell you later, Godfather.

02:14:57.902 --> 02:15:00.102
Better to take me to my "house"

02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.000
Wait godson.

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.600
Be careful.

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:26.434
Lupita.
Lupita!

02:15:26.435 --> 02:15:29.600
Lupita.

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.899
No one's here, godson.

02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:34.434
Can't you tell me what is happening?

02:15:34.435 --> 02:15:36.934
Hold on, Godfather.
My beautiful.

02:15:36.935 --> 02:15:39.100
My beautiful.

02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:46.100
Ah!
My love.

02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:50.100
Oh you scared me, my love.

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.600
My love.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.600
My love!

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.600
- Take this, my son.
- No.

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.600
- Come on.
- Thank you.

02:17:15.799 --> 02:17:18.933
Ma, I'm going.

02:17:18.934 --> 02:17:22.965
What will you do?
When are you coming back?

02:17:24.799 --> 02:17:27.500
Actually, the truth is I don’t think 
you'll see me again.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.200
Take care of yourself.

02:17:33.799 --> 02:17:36.799
- May God be with you.
- Thank you.

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:43.700
It's crazy, Benny.

02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:46.534
You really don’t want me to go with you?

02:17:46.535 --> 02:17:48.700
Thank you, Godfather.

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:51.534
I'm leaving my mother with you.

02:17:51.535 --> 02:17:53.499
Take care, godson.

02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:56.534
In the truck you'll find all you asked for.

02:17:56.535 --> 02:17:58.700
Thank you, Godfather.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.200
Goodbye, Mom.

02:18:39.299 --> 02:18:43.500
<i> One, two, three testing.</i>

02:18:51.799 --> 02:18:54.000
