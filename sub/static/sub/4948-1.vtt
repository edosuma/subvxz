Translation: * NoCredits *
Synch: NLU002

03:50.364 --> 03:52.910
You have not done badly.

03:53.027 --> 03:56.402
They're back, Dad.
- Who?

03:56.422 --> 03:59.023
The samples.
- What?

04:10.420 --> 04:12.447
Why do they do that, Dad?
That's not good.

04:12.466 --> 04:16.447
No, that's not good boy, that's for sure.
But it is what it is, come.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.338
Why?
- You said it yourself, you know.

04:19.358 --> 04:23.693
They're monsters.
But that's all they are.

04:23.712 --> 04:28.187
It is his creeps, they hunt in groups
and they have provided on the weak.

04:28.207 --> 04:31.971
Yes, but not for me?
- No, not you, I promise.

04:31.990 --> 04:35.945
How can you be so sure?
- Because if you do not know:

04:35.964 --> 04:41.183
Always remember, outside this house is a forest

04:41.202 --> 04:45.267
a big, dark, scary forest
full of bad characters

04:45.287 --> 04:48.105
waiting in the trees
to get you to take.

04:48.378 --> 04:51.019
That's why I tell you, boy.
- I do not like it, dad.

04:51.038 --> 04:55.684
I know, but do not worry.
There are three simple rules

04:55.703 --> 04:58.157
that help you to survive in the scary forest.

04:58.176 --> 05:02.067
And if you remember, nothing will
you ever lost or can not do.

05:02.086 --> 05:04.509
What are the rules, dad?
- Okay, good.

05:04.528 --> 05:08.780
A: Always pay attention to strangers.

05:08.799 --> 05:14.547
Do not always know what they say, because
can the wolves in sheep's clothing.

05:15.137 --> 05:20.835
Two: be loyal, boy. Especially to people,
you love and you trust.

05:21.391 --> 05:26.778
And three: it's time to go to sleep.
- Dad.

05:26.797 --> 05:30.008
No, wait, I remember.
Three, yes.

05:30.027 --> 05:34.286
This is important.
Act like a lion, boy

05:34.305 --> 05:37.237
not act like a lamb.
Do not follow other people.

05:37.256 --> 05:41.968
Go on your own instincts
and stick to what you think is right.

05:42.354 --> 05:46.314
Live in the scary forest, follow the magical rules.

05:46.334 --> 05:48.921
Then nothing will ever get
or something can participate.

05:48.950 --> 05:52.903
The time now is 02:00.

05:53.349 --> 05:58.049
You better go to sleep.
- Why not help anyone?

05:59.819 --> 06:05.122
There is no one to help.
- We'll call the police, they stop it?

06:06.435 --> 06:08.498
Go to sleep, boy.

06:26.695 --> 06:30.021
If we see you again
then I'm not happy.

06:30.041 --> 06:35.174
Okay, now you little bastard.
- And you know what you forgot?

06:35.193 --> 06:38.153
Thank you to say.
Say it.

06:38.173 --> 06:40.870
Say, thank you, damn.
- I think he's had enough.

06:40.885 --> 06:43.023
Let's go.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.832
Since when vacuuming your
the kitchen floor, Jenny?

07:17.588 --> 07:20.994
Damn.
- Do you have headaches, Willie?

07:21.246 --> 07:24.495
You were quite drunk last night,
you could not even come up the stairs.

07:24.514 --> 07:26.996
It happens when you go out with the guys.
- Yes, you say.

07:27.015 --> 07:30.088
A man works hard all week
and then requires a drink.

07:30.108 --> 07:33.060
A few drinks? You tell him, Paul?

07:33.079 --> 07:35.167
It is true, Daddy.
You made us crazy.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.576
You started to sing a song
the Black and White Minstrels.

07:37.595 --> 07:40.021
And when you tried to go watch TV.
- Is that really so?

07:40.040 --> 07:43.317
And when you fell asleep and snored.
- Your father has his old behavior again.

07:43.336 --> 07:46.544
There was probably nothing on TV again.
What do you think, boy?

07:46.564 --> 07:48.338
No comment.
- That's better.

07:48.357 --> 07:51.192
Where is my new shirt, Jenny?
- That's the clothesline stolen.

07:51.211 --> 07:53.943
They have things again
stolen from the clothesline, damn.

07:53.962 --> 07:55.887
What is a Snowdropper?
- A Snowdropper

07:55.906 --> 07:58.295
is the lowest form of life
on this planet, boy.

07:58.315 --> 08:01.148
Harness that clothing clothesline
steal from other people.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.466
They even stole the diapers
the clothesline of Pearl Jones.

08:03.485 --> 08:06.100
It's getting worse.
- Yes.

08:07.136 --> 08:09.826
Where are you going?
- I take a walk.

08:09.845 --> 08:11.881
I'll make it up with Johnny and Jimmy.

08:11.900 --> 08:17.532
Put your coat on because it's cold.
- That's right, do the damn door.

08:17.551 --> 08:21.362
Be careful and 16.00 back, yes?
- Okay.

08:24.675 --> 08:26.643
Jesus.

08:43.287 --> 08:46.068
<i> Go hang out somewhere else, asshole. </ i>
- I ram it together.</i>

08:46.087 --> 08:48.186
<i> I can not earn as you're here. </ i></i>

08:48.205 --> 08:50.198
<i> It's still early,
just do what you gotta do. </ i></i>

08:50.217 --> 08:52.034
Give me a loaf of bread, please.
- <i> Bread </ i>?</i>

08:52.053 --> 08:54.099
<i> I will give you a much, Corey. </ i></i>

08:57.252 --> 08:59.385
<i> You stay do annoying. </ i></i>

09:00.581 --> 09:02.765
Come, come.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.884
I just saw the Banks brothers.
- Where?

09:04.903 --> 09:08.112
Down the street.
- I hope they die, that ugly.

09:08.495 --> 09:11.245
And I had to wash this finger again.
- Why?

09:11.265 --> 09:14.179
Lisa Boyue
- Lisa Boyue, you can not.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.165
She gave me three flying saucers
if I would do it.

09:16.184 --> 09:18.418
And I would get a Bazooka Joe
if she could sit. to my dick

09:18.438 --> 09:20.102
But I did not.
- When?

09:20.121 --> 09:22.204
About ten minutes ago,
there in that alley.

09:22.223 --> 09:26.445
I'll get you, you little shit.
- Get the colÃ¨re.

09:26.464 --> 09:29.709
I make you off.
- I kick shit out of him that little bastard.

09:29.728 --> 09:31.948
So hard I fucking kick him dead.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.863
Was that you like, who stood to peek?
- That was not me.

09:34.882 --> 09:38.436
I've seen it with my own eyes.
- I have not seen anything, I promise.

09:38.743 --> 09:42.318
Make sure it stays that way or I'll stab
your eyes out next time.

09:43.514 --> 09:46.424
Leave him alone, irascible.
- Ugly bastards.

09:46.443 --> 09:49.216
We count with you later on.
- We know where you live.

09:50.138 --> 09:52.933
Go to your friends' sucker,
come on, now.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.083
Kick that ball is to me.

09:58.254 --> 10:01.240
I said, kick the ball! Here.

10:29.786 --> 10:33.547
It's settled.
- When?

10:33.567 --> 10:38.169
Friday, it must be at your service.
- Okay.

10:38.188 --> 10:41.161
If the money is not paid in advance,
I do not know what happens.

10:41.180 --> 10:44.836
And if it goes wrong you can not get it back.
You hear that Ferris?

10:46.154 --> 10:48.052
I see.
- You must arrange own

10:48.071 --> 10:51.236

can be. not blamed

10:51.255 --> 10:53.827
If you do, we will do the rest, okay?

10:55.632 --> 10:57.504
Great.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.884
Look at that now,
you look good, boy.

11:34.904 --> 11:37.733
I hope she is prepared.
- Shoot it out now, please.

11:37.752 --> 11:40.201
I told you dad, you do not come with me.
- It is rough to it there.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.223
You do not know what can happen.
Jenny, have you seen my wallet?

11:43.242 --> 11:46.221
Why do you need? Your portfolio
You bring your son out for a date.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.051
That must be another excuse to go to the pub
to go, he thinks I'm stupid.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.612
Maybe I'll just go along
for a little refreshment, yes.

11:51.631 --> 11:54.553
Yes, and I've heard before,
Willie Ferris.

11:54.573 --> 11:57.401
Come on, stupid stuff.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.292
How are you?
- Fine.

12:01.311 --> 12:03.271
Are you okay?
- All right, Dad.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.809
Are you sure? You still
problems with the Banks brothers.

12:07.091 --> 12:11.137
How do you know?
- I saw a large knife in your pocket.

12:11.601 --> 12:13.945
That?
- Yes.

12:14.007 --> 12:15.776
That is only for protection,
everyone has one.

12:15.795 --> 12:17.754
Yes, I know that.
I had myself always with me.

12:17.773 --> 12:19.301
Come here.

12:21.893 --> 12:25.084
Give me that knife, boy.
You do not need it, believe me.

12:25.103 --> 12:27.044
If you carry it with you
then you use it, that's a fact.

12:27.063 --> 12:30.704
And if you do, then what?
To jail for murder and why?

12:30.724 --> 12:32.849
For a bunch of cowardly thugs?

12:34.033 --> 12:35.995
I know they're over the years
have geterorriseerd

12:36.014 --> 12:37.863
and every time that you had bruises
when you came home.

12:37.882 --> 12:42.208
But you're better than them, boy.
Better than they will ever be.

12:44.014 --> 12:47.866
I would like to change.
I did not want this for my family

12:47.885 --> 12:51.062
but we have to live with,
as good as it comes.

12:52.163 --> 12:54.881
You can not do this, boy,
I can not.

12:55.312 --> 12:58.237
It's not worth it, come on.

13:00.328 --> 13:02.339
That's good, son.

13:04.812 --> 13:08.812
A fun evening and be careful.

13:22.706 --> 13:26.201
How many girlfriends have you had?
- You're my first.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.980
Do you think I believe?
- You think I'm lying to you?

13:28.999 --> 13:32.257
I do not know, would you do that?
- And if you were not the first

13:32.277 --> 13:34.493
then definitely the best.

13:37.556 --> 13:40.341
<i> Okay. </ i>
- Leave them alone, get off him.</i>

13:40.361 --> 13:43.181

13:44.896 --> 13:46.351
<i> Party. </ i>

13:46.370 --> 13:49.563
<i> Damn bitch. </ i>
- Fucking what?</i>

13:49.582 --> 13:51.433
<i> You know. </ i></i>

13:58.082 --> 14:01.369
Ferris, let me look at you girl.
- Fuck you.

14:01.388 --> 14:05.662
What the fuck did you say?
You told me to fuck off.

14:06.761 --> 14:09.776
Do not believe you.
He said I had to rot.

14:10.544 --> 14:12.202
What did he say?

14:12.868 --> 14:14.978
Outwardly you.
- Please Paul, just go.

14:14.998 --> 14:18.040
They will demolish the whole thing here.
- Yeah, just listen to your girl

14:18.059 --> 14:21.281
because otherwise I will get you.
Yes, that's what I mean, man.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.604
Rot in hell.
- Nice boyfriend you, have not you?

14:24.623 --> 14:26.465
A sissy.

14:39.603 --> 14:42.715
That was the last time,
the last time.

14:54.815 --> 14:58.318
Your boyfriend's gone, so there
we have no more trouble.

15:00.995 --> 15:02.853
Dirty cow.

15:06.502 --> 15:08.777
Have you ever had a good turn?

15:21.176 --> 15:24.162
<i> No, stop it. </ i></i>

15:24.926 --> 15:27.946
No, damn it.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.068
Damn.

15:38.262 --> 15:40.915
Hell, no.

16:08.115 --> 16:11.184
You have to stay here until something arranged.

16:12.610 --> 16:16.674
The Banks brothers ...
What has inspired you, Paul?

16:17.483 --> 16:20.058
Mom, get a heart attack
when she finds out.

16:20.964 --> 16:25.480
Do you want to be just like your brother, Billy?
Life in prison?

16:26.616 --> 16:28.876
You're not so, Paul Ferris.

16:29.449 --> 16:32.056
This is not the little guy I know.

16:33.541 --> 16:37.568
I enjoyed it.
- Paul?

16:38.661 --> 16:43.974
For the first time in my life,
I was not afraid.

16:46.601 --> 16:49.335
The first time I do not me
felt intimidated.

16:51.743 --> 16:56.598
I tell you Cath, I enjoyed it.
- Paul.

16:56.617 --> 17:01.436
I'm telling you.
It was easy.

17:02.298 --> 17:06.457
I had the upper hand, I was in control.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.048
For the first time in my life,
I what they really are. saw

17:11.088 --> 17:14.402
Nothing.

17:15.758 --> 17:20.762
I have admitted that they exist.
- You've changed.

17:23.161 --> 17:27.857
I can still look in your eyes
and see a little boy

17:28.084 --> 17:32.075
A little man full of life and ready
for what's coming at him.

17:34.770 --> 17:37.238
I look in your eyes.

17:37.718 --> 17:39.834
And you know what I see?

17:41.958 --> 17:43.813
Demons.

17:58.563 --> 18:02.693
Paul, why do we do it?
You're about two months.

18:02.713 --> 18:06.079
Why the hell would you do that?
- It must be so.

18:06.637 --> 18:10.790
Listen, we're gonna murder a young guy.
Nobody stands in line to do so.

18:10.809 --> 18:14.759
No, we have to drive over, it's
almost always destined.

18:14.779 --> 18:18.183
It's always been the same
with guests, the rule.

18:18.202 --> 18:21.633
Can not you
change your mind, right?

18:22.536 --> 18:26.582
You know what? I've always been afraid
you were going to murder them. lunatics

18:26.887 --> 18:29.188
And now going to show you that I'm right.

18:29.207 --> 18:32.870
Okay, time to go to work.

18:34.143 --> 18:37.202
I see you, big guy.
You'll be fine, right?

18:37.221 --> 18:39.697
No worries for me.

18:54.236 --> 18:58.980
<i> Fuck you assholes,
you fucking assholes. </ i></i>

19:50.336 --> 19:53.007
You get up, you lazy bastards criminal.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.310
In the row for a thorough examination.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.129
Ten seconds and then
You can stay where you are.

20:00.379 --> 20:03.643
Did you hear what I just said, Banks?

20:08.135 --> 20:10.141
I said if you do not ...

20:10.737 --> 20:13.201
Jesus Christ.

20:16.570 --> 20:20.719
He is as dead as a doornail, get help.

20:22.111 --> 20:24.757
You two, back to your cell.

20:36.732 --> 20:41.056
The director wants to see you Ferris now.

20:41.336 --> 20:45.702
Fuck you, tell him I want to see him tomorrow.
- I said, now.

20:47.486 --> 20:51.464
I hope it continues business
and that you motherfuckers do normally.

20:54.399 --> 20:58.429
Ferris, have enjoyed
of your solitary confinement?

20:58.449 --> 21:01.823
Yes, thank you, sir, great accommodations
if I may say so.

21:01.842 --> 21:05.496
Do not take me for a ride, Ferris.
- I'm not taking you for a ride, sir.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.890
I actually enjoyed the experience,
I found the solitary confinement inspiring.

21:09.915 --> 21:12.579
I have a poem made, if you ...
- Ferris.

21:12.598 --> 21:15.724
I do not hear those kinds BijDeGraaf answers.

21:15.744 --> 21:17.567
Why do you ask that, sir?

21:17.586 --> 21:21.745
You think you're smart, do not kid?
You are self-righteous.

21:21.765 --> 21:26.253
You think you're a lot.
But let me tell you something, Ferris.

21:26.272 --> 21:31.297
Look in the mirror.
Look in that black hole

21:31.316 --> 21:33.496
of that soul of yours
and then you see that you are nothing.

21:33.515 --> 21:36.183
Nothing.

21:36.658 --> 21:38.473
You may think
that what you're on the street

21:38.492 --> 21:42.238
but for me you are nothing.
Because this is my world.

21:42.257 --> 21:45.929
Where do I hand out the sheets,
I am God.

21:45.948 --> 21:49.400
People like you are the foam
of this earth, Ferris.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.971
You may leave here in a few days
with a giant reputation.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.351
But I'll tell you this:

21:56.261 --> 22:01.506
You come back here,
I guarantee you.

22:02.694 --> 22:04.179
Can I say something, sir?

22:07.696 --> 22:11.284
You should look at yourself.
- I fuck, warning you Ferris.

22:11.303 --> 22:16.245
Let him say what. Let
see what the little guy has to say.

22:18.008 --> 22:23.598
The way I see it,
if you would look closely at yourself

22:23.761 --> 22:27.468
beyond all monsters and demons that you see.
You than a lost

22:27.496 --> 22:30.230
frightened little boy sees,
who has chosen

22:30.250 --> 22:33.130
to close in itself at this
large ivory tower of concrete.

22:33.201 --> 22:36.432
And who has surrounded himself with suckers
in uniform who serve him.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.349
A bunch of yes-men who all orders
follow without asking questions.

22:40.477 --> 22:44.586
That might be your world and your God.
And for what?

22:44.720 --> 22:47.009
That you just said yourself, that is
for the foam of this earth.

22:47.028 --> 22:49.175
That shit in your shoe.

22:49.574 --> 22:52.664
And I must say that God,
no idea of ??what is happening.

22:52.941 --> 22:55.668
Blind to the blows being dealt
and all the corruption

22:55.687 --> 22:58.949
where you morons you every day
keep doing here.

22:59.247 --> 23:03.325
Because if you say you know it all
then you are really no better than us.

23:03.827 --> 23:07.853
You know what, sir? It's funny
but I feel sorry for you.

23:08.666 --> 23:12.512
I walk out of here in three days, but you ...

23:13.706 --> 23:15.738
You have life.

23:27.849 --> 23:31.935
Okay, you bastard, we will once
show what suckers we are.

23:45.743 --> 23:48.160
I think that is our size.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.804
Welcome back to planet F, Mr. Ferris.

23:56.334 --> 23:58.270
Good to see. You

23:58.476 --> 24:00.938
We make it right, little man.
- I have a couple of credit.

24:00.957 --> 24:03.963
What the hell happened to you?
- We had our own battle.

24:03.982 --> 24:07.612
Is that so?
Who, Mike Tyson?

24:23.713 --> 24:27.051
What is going on?
- Not much Paul.

24:27.071 --> 24:29.489
What little things, but nothing
that we can not handle.

24:29.508 --> 24:33.530
Is that really so?
- Yes.

24:33.550 --> 24:35.842
You still have the stitches?

24:39.824 --> 24:43.777
It's not Paul, a few threads
in my back, no worries.

24:43.835 --> 24:47.521
How much?
- Fifty.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.366
Jesus Christ.

24:49.668 --> 24:53.574
How's your girlfriend, Jimmy?
- She's a little moody, Paul.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.050
That's all.
- Arthur Thompson

24:56.069 --> 24:58.175
wants a meeting.
He gives a party

24:58.194 --> 25:01.012
and he wants to talk about our problems.
- When?

25:01.142 --> 25:03.749
Tonight.
- I'm not going there tonight.

25:03.768 --> 25:06.654
Just take me home.
- He gets angry if you do not come, Paul.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.614
What can I care, mate.
I did not ask for a party.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.359
What should we say to him?
- Tell him what you want.

25:12.477 --> 25:15.226
As for me, tell him
he can get. colÃ¨re the

25:15.668 --> 25:18.712
That kind of stuff you do not say
against the Godfather, Paul.

25:19.626 --> 25:21.585
Just get me to go home, okay?

25:33.202 --> 25:35.714
Look who's next to us, boy.

25:36.396 --> 25:38.781
Who's that, Daddy?
- That's Arthur Thompson

25:38.801 --> 25:40.710
a hard bastard
you can not trust.

25:40.729 --> 25:43.038
It sells grandmother for a penny.

25:43.057 --> 25:47.250
Hello Arthur, get the shit.
- What does he do, Dad?

25:47.269 --> 25:50.885
He's a leech, boy.
- He lives off the blood of the weak.

25:50.904 --> 25:53.593
Like a vampire, dad?
- A vampire?

25:53.612 --> 25:56.789
That's a good description.
- Listen to me carefully.

25:56.809 --> 26:01.514
Stay away from that man.
- He's the devil in disguise.

26:07.652 --> 26:13.402
Paul, you're home.

26:14.359 --> 26:18.304
You step out or not?
- Sorry Johnny, I was somewhere else.

26:18.762 --> 26:22.362
How does Anne Marie it?
- You're going to see that, Paul.

26:29.774 --> 26:31.491
What happened?

26:36.929 --> 26:40.517
Nothing.
- I do not see it forward.

26:41.201 --> 26:46.019
Really honey, it's nothing.
That's true.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.478
This can not, Paul.

26:50.220 --> 26:55.312
What, dear?
- This, all, look at yourself.

26:56.068 --> 26:58.595
It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

26:58.614 --> 27:00.886
I'm afraid.
- Why?

27:00.906 --> 27:05.358
Why?
Get the colÃ¨re, Paul Ferris.

27:21.184 --> 27:23.395
I do not understand what's going on.

27:23.988 --> 27:28.167
You spent nine months, the last
two, I have not even gotten a letter.

27:28.186 --> 27:31.795
You could perhaps have been killed.
- I was in solitary confinement, Anne.

27:31.814 --> 27:34.572
That's what I mean.
Do you hear what you're saying?

27:34.591 --> 27:38.317
I was in solitary confinement, Anne.
As if you were on holiday in Spain.

27:38.376 --> 27:41.155
Already you feel
lost to reality?

27:41.174 --> 27:44.751
This must stop if we have a future
have together like that really.

27:44.770 --> 27:47.236
I still care for you.
- Fuck you.

27:47.426 --> 27:52.288
So does an ordinary guy too.
His wife also gives money

27:52.307 --> 27:55.208
but her husband does not risk life.
Or worse, he'll die.

27:55.227 --> 28:00.072
You take everything out of context.
- Mothering me, Paul Ferris.

28:00.242 --> 28:04.133
Who do you think I am?
Some bimbo from the pub?

28:04.284 --> 28:06.071
I just ...
- Shut up, please.

28:06.277 --> 28:09.542
You know I did know, why do you say that?

28:09.561 --> 28:11.508
Motherfucker.

28:19.772 --> 28:22.537
Sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

28:23.009 --> 28:28.768
Everything will be fine, I promise.
- Paul I'm afraid, so afraid.

28:32.172 --> 28:35.770
Look at me.

28:37.810 --> 28:39.838
What has changed everything?

28:41.178 --> 28:44.149
Nothing has changed, right?

28:45.756 --> 28:47.709
Do you believe me?

28:51.838 --> 28:54.847
Do you believe me?
Yes?

28:56.663 --> 28:59.458
He was really angry
that you did not appear at the party.

28:59.478 --> 29:03.427
They have distributed.
Anyone in any case.

29:03.446 --> 29:06.794
Arthur thought no one there to
could come to you would be free.

29:06.814 --> 29:08.773
I feel sorry for him, actually.

29:09.777 --> 29:11.916
Arthur Thompson?
- No.

29:11.935 --> 29:14.481
with that guy a sandwich
took with cheese and onions.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.773
Thompson junior, broke both his hands
with a pool cue.

29:17.792 --> 29:21.540
Did the Fatboy that?
- Yes, and he made a show of.

29:21.559 --> 29:23.198
Everyone was watching.

29:23.217 --> 29:26.304
It was like those things
that you see in places like Iran.

29:26.323 --> 29:29.018
A damn public execution.
- And to finish the

29:29.037 --> 29:32.539
he pushed the cue
in the poor guy's ass.

29:33.012 --> 29:35.097
That part was fabricated.
- Really.

29:35.116 --> 29:37.455
Where was Anne then?
-. I do not know

29:56.138 --> 29:58.162
Can I have a Harpins, darling?

30:04.932 --> 30:07.872
I met Arthur Thompson here.
Is he there?

30:08.515 --> 30:10.573
Junior, sitting there.

30:11.186 --> 30:15.399
There he is at last,
the little man himself, Paul Ferris.

30:15.419 --> 30:17.788
Come sit with us, Paul.
Drink with us.

30:21.338 --> 30:24.316
You know what this is, Paul?
- Pepper spray.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.315
What the hell is that?

30:30.736 --> 30:35.125
That was a test.
These are the two knuckleheads.

30:35.711 --> 30:38.204
Paul Come, come sit next to me.

30:41.512 --> 30:44.652
You want a drink?
- This is okay.

30:45.194 --> 30:48.931
Look, we've all heard what you
've done with that bastard Banks.

30:49.354 --> 30:51.573
Had it done like himself, Paul.
I swear to God.

30:51.592 --> 30:53.371
That's just a rumor, junior.

30:54.550 --> 30:58.310
Do you believe what he says, boys?
He cuts out half of the opposition

30:58.329 --> 31:01.293
on his own and calls it unfortunate.

31:01.313 --> 31:03.818
I love your style Paul, that's true.

31:08.719 --> 31:11.156
Better a house that is empty
than a bad tenant, not Paul?

31:11.175 --> 31:15.538
I'm here to meet your father.
- The Godfather?

31:19.049 --> 31:23.263
And we know he's waiting for you.
- I'm here now.

31:26.169 --> 31:29.554
He is at his office, the snack bar.

31:51.592 --> 31:53.841
You've done good work, Paul.

31:55.430 --> 31:58.027
A fucking swim in a pond.

31:59.079 --> 32:02.372
A child of six years old,
can you comprehend that?

32:02.733 --> 32:06.550
That beast.

32:11.317 --> 32:14.062
How's your father?
- Fine, Mr. Thompson.

32:14.081 --> 32:17.572
A good man.
You are from a good family, Paul.

32:17.592 --> 32:21.316
I've been watching you.
You make name

32:21.336 --> 32:27.071
and you get respect on the street.
So you do not waste time and go for it.

32:27.478 --> 32:30.814
It is time for you to make promotion.

32:31.347 --> 32:35.495
Would you like to come work for me?

32:36.223 --> 32:41.969
Nothing you have not already done so,
some groceries and small jobs?

32:43.394 --> 32:48.111
Simply, to begin with?
Are you interested?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.840
I am interested.

32:57.361 --> 32:59.834
You work for me now, boy.

33:04.964 --> 33:08.030
Ferris small bowl here.

33:14.089 --> 33:17.452
Ferris.
- Holy shit.

33:17.615 --> 33:20.184
Yeah man, he's gone.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.352
We have warned you twice.

33:49.372 --> 33:53.848
It will not happen again, Arthur.
- I'm sure.

34:08.319 --> 34:12.063
In his head, that's a surprise.
Is he dead?

34:12.143 --> 34:14.136
Flies lay eggs
in the eyes of dead people.

34:14.155 --> 34:16.456
That's why they do that are close in movies.

34:17.138 --> 34:22.139
Do you feel John, he was as cold as ice.
- You get diseases from dead bodies.

34:22.159 --> 34:25.705
We must be careful
that we do not have it already.

34:25.922 --> 34:28.391
Who is it?
-. I do not know

34:28.409 --> 34:30.734
Here is his portfolio.

34:31.425 --> 34:35.248
Jesus, get shit.
Indeed Paul, you're rich.

34:35.268 --> 34:38.704
I'll take the first 40 pounds
and we share the rest.

34:40.059 --> 34:44.440
Where you Paul, I was worried.
- Nowhere ma, I was with the boys.

34:45.344 --> 34:50.034
I was thinking Mom,
buy something nice for yourself.

34:52.748 --> 34:54.826
Paul Ferris.

35:02.212 --> 35:05.838
I'm sorry, I had to
give it all back.

35:05.942 --> 35:10.290
We're not talking about theft, boy.
We are talking about a murder investigation.

35:10.309 --> 35:14.610
But I just found.
You should learn something here, boy.

35:14.994 --> 35:18.291
This time you get a warning.

35:18.788 --> 35:20.748
The next time ...

35:23.000 --> 35:26.224
You must bring him to the office tomorrow.

35:29.744 --> 35:33.208
Would you go back agent?
For the neighbors?

35:37.063 --> 35:40.553
Are you sure you
've seen nothing, little man?

35:40.572 --> 35:43.739
I promise, sir, I have found it.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.975
Sir.

35:56.492 --> 35:58.908
Why did you give him
that money returned, Jenny?

35:58.927 --> 36:01.502
What do you think?
There is a boy death

36:01.522 --> 36:05.044
Willie Ferris, someone's son.
- Who has the money do not need?

36:05.063 --> 36:07.302
The agents keep the money
probably just themselves.

36:07.321 --> 36:09.884
Bunch of assholes.
- He has come.

36:09.903 --> 36:13.740
He gets what from?
- Get it back and forth, Willie.

36:16.747 --> 36:21.538
Listen boy, if you've seen something,
but I'm not saying that it is so.

36:21.557 --> 36:24.502
I saw something.
- Wait, listen to me boy.

36:25.368 --> 36:29.041
You never say anything about that,
against anyone, you understand?

36:29.060 --> 36:33.143
Not against your friends, not to your mother,
not against me, against anyone.

36:33.162 --> 36:35.763
Promise?
- I promise, Dad.

36:35.782 --> 36:39.921
Good boy.
- I have not returned anything, Dad.

36:47.660 --> 36:50.153
Look at it now.

36:56.718 --> 36:58.970
I think everyone here already

36:59.449 --> 37:03.372
Strangely, it does not matter here.
It looks a bit tatty.

37:03.401 --> 37:06.959
I mean, what is that?
- An attempt to stay out of the picture

37:06.978 --> 37:09.354
but with little sense of taste.
As Arthur Thompson

37:09.373 --> 37:13.078
it announced in every newspaper in Scotland,
I would not expect that.

37:13.493 --> 37:15.236
Come.

37:23.545 --> 37:28.415
Yes, it's good.
I'm glad you are come

37:28.434 --> 37:32.158
though you are very late.
- How's your father, Paul?

37:32.177 --> 37:35.169
He still, is not alive?
- This morning still, when I left.

37:35.188 --> 37:38.632
Well, put him greetings from me, okay?

37:38.978 --> 37:42.534
Nothing, why do not you come
sitting at a table for some cheese?

37:42.553 --> 37:44.350
Where did you get this?
- I feel fine.

37:44.369 --> 37:48.853
I'd rather be on my own if I'm honest.
- Mother, do not be rude.

37:48.872 --> 37:53.349
Mother, do not be rude.
With all those young people talking

37:53.368 --> 37:56.088
while she was born in the slum.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.120
Arthur.
- Do not worry, Anne.

37:58.139 --> 38:02.614
Soon she is drunk and falls asleep.
- I heard that.

38:02.634 --> 38:04.650
That was the idea.

38:06.058 --> 38:09.414
Paul, we're gonna go outside,
for some fresh air.

38:09.433 --> 38:12.008
No, you watch your grandmother.
- What, I ...

38:12.027 --> 38:15.566
Nothing to buts, do what I say.

38:15.772 --> 38:19.008
I want Paul to speak alone.
- Okay, father

38:19.027 --> 38:21.125
as you want.

38:22.910 --> 38:27.101
Be served watch too great.
That plays when you're Godfather.

38:27.120 --> 38:31.731
I think nothing, that was the cause
that the Crays stuck 30 years.

38:32.136 --> 38:36.371
I have not noticed, you understand?
- I understand you, Arthur.

38:36.390 --> 38:39.664
The whole game has changed,
the rules are changed.

38:39.952 --> 38:44.362
People afford freedoms where they
a few years ago not to dream.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.877
Look in that bag.

38:51.618 --> 38:54.737
Those filthy bastards, they have the zipper
with glue smeared

38:54.756 --> 38:56.902
so junior could not check properly.

38:56.921 --> 39:02.129
I had to cut and it goes
about 50,000 pounds of stuff.

39:02.149 --> 39:04.751
50,000 pounds, damn.

39:05.176 --> 39:09.935
And if you are going to work
I want my Â£ 50,000 back.

39:10.095 --> 39:12.676
Okay.
- Have you had a something to do

39:12.695 --> 39:16.020
with Licensee McGraw?

39:16.040 --> 39:21.424
McGraw no, but I saw him
even going to work.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.858
Why do you think they call him the licensor?

39:26.878 --> 39:29.509
That is not because he
the owner of a pub.

39:29.528 --> 39:32.713
That's because he police
provision of information.

39:32.723 --> 39:37.510
And in return they give him freedom
to do what he wants.

40:02.410 --> 40:05.896
Who is that?
- Tam McGraw.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.802
He is the owner of this tent.

40:09.801 --> 40:12.346
Ladies and gentlemen, Gary Grishaw.

40:13.569 --> 40:16.679
How are you tonight?
We have a good evening. Yes?

40:17.755 --> 40:20.852
And you honey, you're very fair, right?

40:21.424 --> 40:24.253
And if you got a penny for your thoughts
then you would get some money, right?

40:24.272 --> 40:27.632
And there is one,
how would we call it?

40:27.651 --> 40:30.065
Okay, come on.
- I know, asshole.

40:39.021 --> 40:41.556
Well, that's quite funny.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.543
Help me.

40:54.119 --> 40:58.523
If you see this, which is the largest,
who actually did the least pain.

40:58.542 --> 41:01.397
But this man, you do not know.

41:04.129 --> 41:07.564
Yes, you did very very.

41:07.583 --> 41:10.002
Too many cuts.
- The wounds of Jesus.

41:10.021 --> 41:12.938
That's Johnny, just nonsense.

41:12.957 --> 41:14.536
A butcher holds it, is not it dear?

41:14.555 --> 41:18.596
Do not you want to work for junior?
- The Fatboy?

41:18.623 --> 41:21.682
I do not work for that bastard.
I work for his father.

41:21.701 --> 41:23.898
I am just overwhelmed with his bullshit.

41:23.918 --> 41:27.950
From what I saw, I thought
he was in charge.

41:27.970 --> 41:33.113
Take it from me to size, the Fatboy
is a dreamer like Walter Mitty.

41:33.342 --> 41:37.305
Do you know what movie he ever look back?
- What is that?

41:37.325 --> 41:41.755
The Godfather, 24 hours a day.

41:42.174 --> 41:43.697
I had to guess.

41:43.716 --> 41:49.466
How do you like to make promotional treasure?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

41:49.727 --> 41:53.979
The promotion of Paul.
- Promotion, I am just lost.

41:53.999 --> 41:58.067
Did he never about his job?
- That's true, but not with me.

41:58.112 --> 42:00.409
Have you ever wondered why?
- Because I do not want to know.

42:00.428 --> 42:03.531
A man like Paul, a strong woman
behind them.

42:03.550 --> 42:07.657
Maybe he should then go looking.
- A girl like you should be grateful.

42:07.676 --> 42:10.603
What?
- For what you can get, damn.

42:10.623 --> 42:12.614
From who?
- From us.

42:13.027 --> 42:16.076
What is respect, Rita?
I do not want anything from you.

42:16.095 --> 42:18.349
People would give their right arm
to be working with us.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.518
Maybe, but that his
Paul's business, not mine.

42:26.131 --> 42:29.867
We're going if you do not mind.
- Yes, of course, I'm also a little tired.

42:29.886 --> 42:31.905
Just bring mama home.

42:32.734 --> 42:35.392
I'll take her if you want.
- No, I have put her off.

42:35.411 --> 42:37.570
It is nearby.

42:41.336 --> 42:44.272
Come, I take that on.

42:49.604 --> 42:51.577
Careful now.

42:54.741 --> 42:59.889
Maggie, that you may be
call an evening sherry.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.653
It is my only sin
and I only have a couple.

43:04.672 --> 43:07.012
Yes, but boarding.

43:08.861 --> 43:10.624
Good.

43:25.598 --> 43:28.282
'Godfather' Thompson slain
with a car bomb.

43:32.239 --> 43:36.382
I'm sorry Maggie, Arthur.
She was a nice old lady.

43:36.402 --> 43:38.227
A damn shame.

43:40.262 --> 43:43.605
Where is that damn son of mine?
He should be here.

43:43.624 --> 43:46.199
He is very upset, Arthur.
He is not himself.

43:46.218 --> 43:50.504
Drunk mean you or
the world of coke.

43:50.902 --> 43:54.746
I want the person who did this.
- Do you have any idea?

43:54.765 --> 43:59.968
Do you think I would be here as
if I had any idea?

44:00.731 --> 44:06.224
Go do something, it does not matter
what it costs, I want names.

44:06.244 --> 44:11.439
I want names.
- Good boss, we arrange.

44:15.803 --> 44:19.139
He was lucky.
- Tell me about it.

44:19.149 --> 44:23.310
I have someone close
see shooting in Gunfield him.

44:23.723 --> 44:26.526
He was so angry that he
went after that guy.

44:26.806 --> 44:30.386
And Arthur grabbed the arm of that guy off
and hit him dead with that thing.

44:30.405 --> 44:32.129
That's incredible.

44:34.036 --> 44:37.194
But that was in the old days.
- Yes.

44:38.696 --> 44:41.085
Strange that it is not true.

44:41.687 --> 44:45.800
With what she drank that night
she probably sounded like fireworks.

44:51.369 --> 44:53.345
It's okay.

45:08.562 --> 45:10.927
It was those damn Banks brothers.

45:16.395 --> 45:19.680
Do you want to taste it, sir?
- No, thank you.

45:19.699 --> 45:24.024
Do you want me to inschenk sir?
- No, I just want you to fuck off.

45:28.837 --> 45:31.831
That's a serious accusation.
- They walked to boast in the pub

45:31.850 --> 45:33.743
for about ten minutes
after the car exploded.

45:33.762 --> 45:36.939
They were so sure that he was dead
that they could not wait to tell.

45:37.895 --> 45:40.651
Why would they want to stand up against him?
- It was an easy attack

45:41.365 --> 45:43.944
and are a bunch of assholes, that's why.

45:43.963 --> 45:46.028
They seemed to work. Way up

45:47.788 --> 45:52.785
And what does that have to do with me?
- We'll let you know that we take revenge.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.806
The Banks will want to hide
and you do not want on the wrong side.

45:55.825 --> 46:00.315
Of course, the world is
a better place without scum.

46:00.334 --> 46:02.562
You tell Arthur that I 100%
'm on his side.

46:02.581 --> 46:04.560
He knows that, Tam.

46:04.579 --> 46:06.860
He wants to offer an olive branch to
so to speak.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.481
He said you way
had to find ways to work together.

46:11.375 --> 46:15.826
Thank him.
And I feel really flattered me.

46:15.845 --> 46:20.678
If this is controlled by the Banks brothers
we will arrange a meeting

46:20.697 --> 46:23.470
and we see what we can do.
Paul, if you need help with that rig

46:23.489 --> 46:28.536
you say it.
- No, we handle this.

46:34.490 --> 46:39.203
Well, that Paul that gets me there.

46:45.824 --> 46:49.691
I can not believe it.
- I was afraid to tell you.

46:49.924 --> 46:54.184
Bang, why?
-. I do not know

46:54.251 --> 46:57.734
I did not know how you'd react.
- For me not?

46:58.495 --> 47:02.776
It's the best news I ever got.
You are everything to me.

47:03.577 --> 47:07.133
So we have a baby, really?

47:10.255 --> 47:12.117
A baby.

47:13.172 --> 47:16.160
What do you know Paul, I never thought
that you would cheat.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.721
Say John he can play billiards me?

47:19.845 --> 47:21.927
Paul, these are the men
I was talking about.

47:21.946 --> 47:24.216
This is Joe Hanlan.
- How is Paul?

47:24.235 --> 47:26.302
This is Bobby Glover.
- Thanks for the meeting, Paul.

47:26.321 --> 47:29.563
What do you guys?
- We want to join with you.

47:29.582 --> 47:31.361
I have all this done for the Licensee.

47:31.381 --> 47:33.554
I heard.
- You know I think what he's doing, Paul.

47:33.573 --> 47:35.690
That guy is a fucking snitch
and everyone knows it.

47:35.709 --> 47:37.866
And he gives guys like us,
a bad name.

47:37.886 --> 47:40.647
Your timing is not so lucky,
, you realize that?

47:40.666 --> 47:44.444
Yes Paul, the Banks are outlawed.

47:44.463 --> 47:47.636
I assure you that we
100% behind you.

47:47.663 --> 47:51.023
We have to pick up a pack on the south side.

47:51.042 --> 47:55.132
We're going to show what happens Glasgow
with guests the Thompsons bother.

47:55.151 --> 47:59.193
We send them a message, you hear me?
A damn message.

47:59.213 --> 48:03.905
Their damn engines, walking dead
are those bastards.

48:03.924 --> 48:06.733
I'll tell you what Paul, I want their eyes.

48:07.516 --> 48:10.765
Do you understand what I mean?
I want their eyes in a jar.

48:10.973 --> 48:15.046
You do not say much, Paul?
A quiet guy.

48:17.425 --> 48:21.460
Hurry you, damn fool.

48:21.925 --> 48:24.508
Throw away that old thing, do me a favor.

48:24.527 --> 48:26.719
Look who steps through that door,
that the Banks brothers.

48:26.738 --> 48:28.712
Do not, I have no weapon with me.
- They let go?

48:28.731 --> 48:31.930
We need to work, junior.
- I said I did not have a gun at me.

48:32.638 --> 48:35.350
Get the colÃ¨re.
- I talk to my dad when we get back.

48:35.369 --> 48:39.281
Paul, shoot them all.
Fucking shoot them all.

48:59.139 --> 49:01.386
Flight but, you little dick.

49:02.897 --> 49:04.558
Damn.

49:06.740 --> 49:09.410
Talk to anyone, grab some weapons
and come right back,

49:09.429 --> 49:12.810
No, I need to talk to my father.
- Why do you talk to him

49:12.830 --> 49:15.770
those two are fucking there.
- This takes planning.

49:15.789 --> 49:18.498
We talk to the old man.
- If you can not handle it

49:18.518 --> 49:20.304
give me but a weapon
and then I'll go back yourself.

49:20.452 --> 49:23.381
Shut your fucking mug close.

49:29.073 --> 49:32.414
They help themselves back to shit.

49:34.879 --> 49:39.390
They have embedded themselves
and refuse to come out.

49:39.747 --> 49:43.019
She had to get
when you had the chance, Paul.

49:44.756 --> 49:48.171
What should we do?
- We go through the front door.

49:51.065 --> 49:54.843
If that is what you want Arthur?
- That's what we all want.

49:55.429 --> 49:58.176
They dishonor the family.
- Do not give me that bullshit mafia.

49:58.195 --> 49:59.854
What is that?

50:03.399 --> 50:06.589
I want their fucking heads on a plate.

50:06.948 --> 50:10.091
It's serious.
We take no prisoners now.

50:10.110 --> 50:13.384
If their children there, I'll take those too.

50:13.403 --> 50:15.403
With all due respect Arthur, let
us with citizens.

50:15.422 --> 50:18.720
Fuck your citizens.
- Will you just shut up?

50:19.421 --> 50:21.608
You have definitely come of that mess
put in your nose?

50:21.628 --> 50:24.221
You do damn about.

50:25.349 --> 50:29.695
It is clean, clinical job.

50:29.714 --> 50:34.475
The sooner, the better, so we again
can go. to our real work

50:35.480 --> 50:41.066
I'd like to just talk to junior.

50:47.187 --> 50:49.200
I'm sorry father.

50:49.631 --> 50:52.728
Do not give me that, I'm sorry father.

50:54.079 --> 50:58.796
Never say I'm sorry, damn.

51:00.587 --> 51:03.067
What's wrong with you, boy?

51:06.587 --> 51:10.205
Your brains are shriveled.

51:12.386 --> 51:17.346
It just comes down you get me
in the face of that beautiful boy.

51:17.462 --> 51:19.916
Who?
- Damn Ferris.

51:20.192 --> 51:23.451
You love him more than me.
- You're fucking awfully stupid.

51:23.471 --> 51:26.048
You lead him to take my place.

51:26.918 --> 51:30.055
Can you hear me, you fucking sinner?
Shut up.

51:30.074 --> 51:32.339
Hear that?

51:35.852 --> 51:41.602
If you goes through, you
more than to fear. Ferris

51:43.609 --> 51:46.907
Do you hear me fuck?
- Yes, I hear your father.

52:14.266 --> 52:18.253
I think we should go there
before they come here.

52:18.272 --> 52:21.075
Then they come over here as
they know what is best for them.

52:21.094 --> 52:23.811
That is so ma, you tell them but.
- Yeah, you're funny.

52:23.830 --> 52:27.067
It was your idea to blow them.
- Is that right?

52:27.087 --> 52:28.622
Yes, it is hell.

52:28.642 --> 52:30.549
It makes no sense to it now
about to go cry, right?

52:30.568 --> 52:32.827
Who whines now?
I'm just saying what.

52:34.956 --> 52:37.118
What the fuck is that?

52:40.217 --> 52:43.872
What the hell is that?

52:55.926 --> 52:57.660
You bastard.

53:00.669 --> 53:02.475
You're gonna die.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.194
Motherfucker.
- Terrible is not it?

53:06.213 --> 53:09.424
All your sons are dead.
- All your fucking bastards.

53:09.443 --> 53:12.352
Do not worry, you're going after them,
you dirty old cunt.

53:12.371 --> 53:15.492
Do not you dare.
- Get the colÃ¨re.

53:15.511 --> 53:17.773
Damn I'm serious, Fatboy.

53:21.640 --> 53:23.497
Get out.

53:28.998 --> 53:34.123
Let's go, hurry up.
- Take Everything out.

53:42.671 --> 53:45.189
There will be gigantic measures
follow Arthur.

53:46.939 --> 53:50.935
No one will miss the Banks family,
but we can not do much, Arthur.

53:50.954 --> 53:54.029
So it is written off as
a drug deal that went wrong

53:54.048 --> 53:56.774
but people are not that stupid.

53:58.328 --> 54:02.800
Give us someone to throw to the wolves
and then I think we can run.

54:05.624 --> 54:08.092
Otherwise it will break you.

54:09.895 --> 54:12.173
Soon, Arthur.

54:14.976 --> 54:16.985
Thanks for the drink.

54:20.065 --> 54:24.107
Look, look at that boy.
- That was George the problems doctor.

54:24.126 --> 54:26.648
What?
- He is a bad cop.

54:26.669 --> 54:28.465
I thought he only
worked for the Licensee.

54:28.485 --> 54:33.436
He is the worst, he has more people
attached than a real doctor would dare.

54:33.455 --> 54:36.696
He is a friend of Arthur.
- He's a fucking cop.

54:36.716 --> 54:41.243
I'm with you.
- But what are you gonna do?

54:50.582 --> 54:53.479
I believe you Â£ 50,000
have for me, my friend.

54:55.884 --> 55:00.065
These are the costs of the Iron Brough
and you have proposed.

55:00.084 --> 55:03.102
I want every penny back or go
many people get beaten.

55:03.121 --> 55:05.176
It's the same with all owners
of small pubs.

55:05.195 --> 55:08.977
I did not know they would.
- You did not want to be here, mate.

55:08.996 --> 55:12.542
I told Arthur that I would settle.
I need a little time.

55:12.561 --> 55:15.485
I am also zeroed.
I need. Still a week

55:15.505 --> 55:19.941
Go get the money, motherfucker
or I'll burn your house down.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.613
I even give him my house
if I can not pay.

55:21.632 --> 55:24.846
On my children Paul, I promise.

55:27.233 --> 55:30.590
Than a week.
You do not want me to come see you.

55:30.609 --> 55:35.325
Thanks Paul, thanks junior.
- Do not thank me dick.

55:37.693 --> 55:42.375
You leave us no choice.
- I promise solemnly.

55:42.395 --> 55:44.171
Thanks Paul.

55:45.327 --> 55:47.185
Okay.

55:57.671 --> 55:59.929
A message from the Godfather.

56:03.564 --> 56:05.622
That was not necessary.

56:08.573 --> 56:11.216
This was necessary, an uprising of the mice.

56:11.688 --> 56:13.518
Let's go.

56:24.647 --> 56:26.639
I want to talk with you about.

56:27.777 --> 56:29.545
If the baby is born,
I think we have to move.

56:29.564 --> 56:35.183
I want to be here no parent.
- Paul Ferris lives in Glasgow, is not it?

56:35.307 --> 56:37.784
Do you think it's a boy?
- A girl.

56:38.676 --> 56:42.974
To educate my child in this shit hole?
- I've had enough.

56:42.995 --> 56:44.954
How to get here?

56:47.833 --> 56:53.575
We have done what someone recently.
I'm not happy.

56:54.799 --> 56:57.443
It's not that I did not previously
have been a bad situation.

56:57.462 --> 57:00.141
I lie well in the market, that's for sure.

57:01.475 --> 57:05.945
It was just a man
that our money was guilty.

57:07.813 --> 57:10.028
This has affected me.

57:12.504 --> 57:17.636
I realized that I am
what I have always detested.

57:18.468 --> 57:21.563
An aggressor and a leech.

57:22.265 --> 57:25.622
I go out with those bastards who
made my life hell.

57:26.104 --> 57:28.235
Where the hell am I doing?

57:29.702 --> 57:35.450
So I've decided that I myself
late pick up and then I quit.

57:36.043 --> 57:38.136
Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

57:38.155 --> 57:41.367
Pigs can fly so?
- I want to stop.

57:41.386 --> 57:44.494
Enough is enough.
- We'll see.

57:44.723 --> 57:47.591
You want, make plans?

57:47.611 --> 57:51.965
What plans?
- Taking over the old man.

57:51.992 --> 57:55.540
He just does things to you about?
- Not really.

57:56.611 --> 58:00.316
Do you understand, are you interested in?

58:00.794 --> 58:03.184
Can I ask why?
- Do you mind?

58:03.204 --> 58:05.110
Go ahead.

58:10.108 --> 58:12.663
Want some?
- No, do not thank me, you.

58:14.250 --> 58:17.412
Do not get me wrong, Tam.
I love my father.

58:17.446 --> 58:22.882
What I'm worried about is getting old
too soft, things run.

58:23.537 --> 58:27.075
Spoken between us he wants nothing
have to do with heroin.

58:27.095 --> 58:29.696
He says it is too great a risk.

58:29.715 --> 58:32.376
Damn Tam, there's all the money.

58:32.396 --> 58:35.849
I'm fed up with only those exactions.

58:35.868 --> 58:40.264
You can get hurt and there is
at least no money.

58:40.615 --> 58:44.460
If you have the police surrendered
then nothing is left.

58:46.458 --> 58:49.788
I listen.
- Okay.

58:50.097 --> 58:52.166
This is what I'm thinking.

58:52.708 --> 58:56.053
When I get to that old, lose
people's respect for me.

58:56.073 --> 58:57.972
Do you understand what I mean?

58:57.992 --> 59:03.037
Inappropriate, how could he do that.
He is not loyal, that bullshit.

59:05.984 --> 59:11.667
I still listen.
- But if you turn it off

59:12.197 --> 59:15.855
then it's just business.
There is a large funeral ...

59:17.630 --> 59:19.966
And then everyone forgot.

59:20.991 --> 59:25.211
I'll handle it for you, Tam.
It will be so easy.

59:28.079 --> 59:32.076
And then?
- And then I put it in with you.

59:32.150 --> 59:36.555
Who wants a war?
We divide the empire with a line.

59:36.574 --> 59:41.123
Every 50% of everything.
Drugs, clubs, protection

59:41.143 --> 59:45.420
the damn pimps
and hops, thank you all.

59:47.261 --> 59:50.254
I hear what you say junior, but I think
you've forgotten

59:50.829 --> 59:54.777
you have a small problem.
I say a little problem.

59:54.796 --> 59:58.440
He? Let the fucking Ferris
to me.

59:58.459 --> 01:00:01.071
I have big plans for him.

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:07.680
I'll deal with that bastard
for once and for all.

01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:09.917
That's part of the deal.

01:00:11.585 --> 01:00:15.137
Raymond Bonnar. Show my name on.
I was not even there.

01:00:15.156 --> 01:00:20.354
He is trapped by Ian Brierley.
- This is a serious situation, guys.

01:00:20.373 --> 01:00:23.665
This is going to be high at stake.

01:00:23.884 --> 01:00:27.397
Where did you get that information?
- Vanco, gave me that information.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:30.324
He is a good source.
Bonnar is caught for murder.

01:00:30.344 --> 01:00:32.489
He gives them information in exchange for a deal.

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:34.281
Police say that dick
super selling marijuana.

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.862
Arthur, I do not understand.
- We are the three of a team not?

01:00:36.881 --> 01:00:39.961
Junior, Tam and I, right?
So why do they only know my name?

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:44.331
That's a fucking mystery.
I do not take risks.

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.216
I love me just lay low.
You are safest with Paul.

01:00:47.235 --> 01:00:52.093
No, I already thought of a holiday.

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:56.075
And if I'm wanted for attempted murder
then it will be a long holiday.

01:00:56.094 --> 01:00:59.276
That's all I need right now.
Someone must sit for nothing.

01:00:59.296 --> 01:01:03.897
Take her out to Comney park.
Employee of the month.

01:01:03.916 --> 01:01:07.335
It is beautiful there, you see
those lovely little squirrels.

01:01:07.354 --> 01:01:10.814
Not gray, the little red.
Very soothing.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.652
I am suspected of murder and he
talks about red squirrels.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:19.082
Do you want to take it easy?
To take it slow, take a break.

01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:23.027
Junior, will you bring it back.
Go get your stuff

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:25.326
and do not worry while you are away.

01:01:25.698 --> 01:01:28.702
I will knit all right.

01:01:40.778 --> 01:01:42.789
Here we are.

01:01:46.121 --> 01:01:48.642
What do you think?
Not bad, right?

01:01:48.662 --> 01:01:50.561
It's fine.

01:01:54.661 --> 01:01:56.417
I point the way.

01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:05.478
If you need anything, call me, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

01:02:07.263 --> 01:02:11.868
I like to do it, no problem, Anne.
You need to relax and enjoy.

01:02:11.888 --> 01:02:14.536
Look, I better go.
My old, you know.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:20.707
But do not worry,
we do it all, right?

01:02:20.893 --> 01:02:23.110
Thank you.
- We keep in touch

01:02:23.129 --> 01:02:25.862
and we'll keep you informed.
Keep your head up.

01:02:43.963 --> 01:02:47.229
It's beautiful.
Nice that we may use.

01:02:47.248 --> 01:02:49.516
Yes, I thought you
could use some distraction.

01:02:49.685 --> 01:02:52.049
This is where I want to live.

01:02:52.216 --> 01:02:56.077
One day, Anne, ever.

01:02:57.216 --> 01:03:00.660
What shall we do?
I am hungry for a nice lunch.

01:03:00.679 --> 01:03:02.858
There are many fine restaurants in the harbor.

01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:05.787
No, we have come here
to the people to be away.

01:03:05.806 --> 01:03:11.031
To relax, just you and me, okay?
- Okay.

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.984
That sounds good.

01:03:30.939 --> 01:03:34.299
Hello, who?

01:03:34.984 --> 01:03:37.820
I think you have the wrong number, okay.

01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:43.531
Police.
- No movement on the floor.

01:03:43.544 --> 01:03:45.641
Down and your hands behind your back.
Do not move.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.112
Wait.
- You little asshole

01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:49.337
you know what I'm gonna do this?

01:03:49.658 --> 01:03:53.849
Damn, stay where you are
and do not move.

01:03:53.868 --> 01:03:56.913
There is a woman in the house.
- That's my wife, she's pregnant.

01:03:56.932 --> 01:03:58.857
No accidents, can you hear me?
- Shut up.

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:00.823
No accidents.
- Shut up.

01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:04.417
Remove the WPC here, now.

01:04:09.214 --> 01:04:11.584
Do you want her out
, please?

01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:20.251
Anything?
- A bat and some money.

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.885
Are you sure?
- I've searched and it is clean.

01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:24.690
Damn.

01:04:35.552 --> 01:04:38.283
What's this?
- You tell me.

01:04:38.302 --> 01:04:40.819
Brown powder?
That's heroin.

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:43.969
Get the colÃ¨re.
- If it is purely

01:04:43.988 --> 01:04:48.056
you will get 8 to 15 years for trade.
- Get the colÃ¨re, you bastard.

01:04:48.075 --> 01:04:50.865
I can disappear
but that's gonna cost you.

01:04:51.351 --> 01:04:54.502
If I must be down, then makes
it does not matter how long it takes

01:04:54.522 --> 01:04:57.099
but then I look at you
and blow your fucking head off.

01:04:57.124 --> 01:04:59.056
I'll shoot you, you bastard.
- Shut up.

01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:02.258
No, you keep your head.
I'm fifteen years

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:05.131
but you can wait a lifetime
until I come get you understand me?

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.396
Get the colÃ¨re.
- Get the colÃ¨re you, you fucking dick.

01:05:07.415 --> 01:05:09.788
You're a bigger criminal
than I'll ever be.

01:05:09.807 --> 01:05:12.956
You've crossed the line, buddy.
You're fair game

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:16.278
and I'm coming after you, you understand me?
Only you, I just grab you.

01:05:16.297 --> 01:05:19.211
You're already dead, man.
Fucking dead, asshole.

01:05:19.231 --> 01:05:21.741
I'll fucking murder.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.653
Paul, you are associated
with the murder of Raymond Bonnar.

01:05:27.244 --> 01:05:31.666
Do you have something to say?
- No comment.

01:05:31.855 --> 01:05:35.363
Raymond Bonnar, has stated that you
tried to murder him.

01:05:35.956 --> 01:05:37.886
What do you say?

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:42.067
No comment.

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:47.781
We have pure morphine, money
and weapons found in your residence.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.191
Would you comment on that?

01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:53.318
No comment.
- We also found ...

01:05:53.337 --> 01:05:57.063
Without respect, that's nonsense.

01:05:57.536 --> 01:05:59.651
Tell me what I've done.

01:06:15.149 --> 01:06:17.642
Let me tell you this, Ferris.

01:06:18.045 --> 01:06:23.628
Who do you actually think you are?
You can not threaten to shoot me. Down

01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:27.061
Well, listen to me.

01:06:29.012 --> 01:06:31.944
We got a tip,
that you would sit in that house.

01:06:31.963 --> 01:06:35.601
Think there is about it. Someone,
has put a price on your head

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.742
and that is not a waste.

01:06:44.437 --> 01:06:46.906
You're a fucking legend.

01:06:48.657 --> 01:06:51.411
If I could sing, I was not ...

01:06:51.648 --> 01:06:54.489
I want to see anybody.

01:06:59.503 --> 01:07:02.571
Bonnar?
- Who wants to know?

01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:05.734
The debt rapporteur.
- Yes.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.651
What the hell are you.
- I want to talk to you, coward.

01:07:15.404 --> 01:07:20.675
This is a disturbing case.
With many snags.

01:07:20.907 --> 01:07:25.505
The indictment for attempted murder
was repealed by Raymond Bonnar

01:07:25.525 --> 01:07:30.751
at his request.
Jurors who do not want to appear.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:35.448
Prove that disappears from police safes.

01:07:35.475 --> 01:07:38.355
A whole list of incompetence
to the police

01:07:38.374 --> 01:07:41.881
and the magic of your hand,
without a doubt.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:47.156
I have a good idea of ??who
and what you are, Ferris.

01:07:47.175 --> 01:07:50.699
But unfortunately
I am bound by the law.

01:07:51.246 --> 01:07:55.688
For possession of offensive weapons,
18 months.

01:07:55.707 --> 01:07:57.454
Take him.

01:08:01.238 --> 01:08:04.251
A message from Paul Ferris, you bastard.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:20.265
The job is done.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:33.212
Very lucky that he survived.
- The old man had a bulletproof vest.

01:08:33.232 --> 01:08:35.685
It is not here fluff at the time, Paul.
- The Fatboy is at it again.

01:08:35.703 --> 01:08:38.808
The knives are drawn.
- They say you gave the order.

01:08:39.298 --> 01:08:41.908
I have some serious issues
arrange when I get out.

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.698
Do you still think that you are betrayed?
- No doubt.

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:48.741
There were only two people
who knew where that house is.

01:08:48.862 --> 01:08:50.959
And I do not think Arthur has betrayed me.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.046
It's someone else's work and
Fatboy is the name written on it.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:59.015
It seems that Fatboy and McGraw
now have become good friends.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.175
Of eternal enemies
the best friends now.

01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:07.817
A Glasgow murder, a bullet
in his ass and in his head.

01:09:07.836 --> 01:09:10.443
Everyone knows that he
a bulletproof vest.

01:09:10.742 --> 01:09:12.395
Why is not he
murdered on the way Glasgow?

01:09:12.416 --> 01:09:14.951
I just lost you.
- It was a fake attack.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:18.845
They have deliberately screwed
to slide.'s on me

01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:22.005
There someone pulling the strings here.

01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:25.796
What should we do?
- Go get Fatboy.

01:09:25.814 --> 01:09:30.096
Take that old grazing and McGraw also
if he so wants.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.712
That starts a war, Paul.
- I did not start here, Jimmy.

01:09:34.259 --> 01:09:37.962
I am taken to graze,
that I will not let go of my hand.

01:09:38.895 --> 01:09:42.613
I think not, damn.
- You screwed this thoroughly.

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:46.965
He only bruised ribs.
He checked himself after two days.

01:09:47.638 --> 01:09:51.752
He is suspicious. He himself
now surrounded by bodyguards.

01:09:51.823 --> 01:09:55.017
That's bad luck, but it'll be fine.
We just have to be patient.

01:09:55.036 --> 01:09:58.566
It is a travesty Tam,
a fucking travesty.

01:09:58.657 --> 01:10:01.558
We must show that we deal
go straighten, you know junior.

01:10:03.892 --> 01:10:07.164
What, Ferris?
- Yes.

01:10:07.758 --> 01:10:09.851
I wanted to divert him. Prison

01:10:09.874 --> 01:10:13.059
I lost two good people
and it cost me a fortune.

01:10:13.079 --> 01:10:15.587
You must show that you
there are personally doing.

01:10:15.606 --> 01:10:17.930
Otherwise it does not look good.

01:10:18.963 --> 01:10:20.966
He is a few weeks back.

01:10:21.114 --> 01:10:24.461
I'll get it myself, personally.

01:10:33.518 --> 01:10:36.391
Where are you looking?

01:10:39.514 --> 01:10:43.699
Pretty boy.
You're my little boy.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.042
I think you better for a while
can go away.

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:53.823
How long?
- Until the dust settles again.

01:10:54.313 --> 01:10:55.942
And then?

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:03.499
I swear Anne Marie,
you mean everything to me.

01:11:05.526 --> 01:11:08.961
When this is over, I'll step out.
I really mean that.

01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:13.779
I want the rest of my life
spend with you.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:16.600
That's all there is.

01:11:18.217 --> 01:11:21.280
You sound like a fucking record.

01:11:26.405 --> 01:11:29.116
I do not want you. Cliche promises

01:11:30.074 --> 01:11:34.542
I think you mean well
and that you think it will happen.

01:11:35.349 --> 01:11:38.340
But if you deep inside
're honest with yourself, Paul

01:11:38.918 --> 01:11:41.014
then you realize that it can never be so.

01:11:42.262 --> 01:11:46.149
It has gone too far.
It has become a part of you.

01:11:46.947 --> 01:11:50.662
It has taken over your life,
your soul repossessed.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:57.080
I have thought long and hard about.

01:11:58.359 --> 01:12:01.325
And I will always
for you are with your child.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.156
But I do not think I love you.

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:00.497
What is this all about, boy?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.487
I'll keep it simple for you, Arthur.

01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:06.609
I have 100% loyalty data.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:10.329
I have performed all orders without question.

01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:15.551
I thought if I could prove myself
I should work independently.

01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:18.022
Would be like a son. I treated

01:13:19.058 --> 01:13:20.945
But what I got in return?

01:13:21.868 --> 01:13:26.299
I'm thrown to the wolves.
- Bullshit.

01:13:26.432 --> 01:13:31.983
You son of a son who minkukel
you, acting in meat.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.254
He has taken me to hell graze.

01:13:35.032 --> 01:13:39.556
And I hear, I'm not the only
which is taken to tackle.

01:13:39.575 --> 01:13:44.704
We can arrange this.
- Therefore it is now too late, Arthur.

01:13:45.103 --> 01:13:47.081
It's gone too far.

01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:50.834
What do you want me to do?

01:13:52.177 --> 01:13:54.735
What the hell do you want from me?

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.000
I want to make sure you
I have not betrayed.

01:14:02.183 --> 01:14:07.625
And then what?
Then you fucking take my son.

01:14:07.897 --> 01:14:10.039
That's not gonna happen.

01:14:11.474 --> 01:14:13.725
I did not ask for this.

01:14:14.608 --> 01:14:16.707
It's up to you to find a solution.

01:14:16.984 --> 01:14:19.533
And it makes me really matter
whether you believe me or not.

01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:22.363
But I was not.

01:14:22.964 --> 01:14:26.764
Look over there, that is Glasgow.

01:14:27.585 --> 01:14:31.556
A lot of blood, sweat and tears
is it sit.

01:14:31.576 --> 01:14:35.980
I am who I am and I do not give up.

01:14:35.999 --> 01:14:41.707
And if you want more, you can get that.

01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:58.121
He was not.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.967
He did not betray me.

01:15:04.065 --> 01:15:06.074
And now what?

01:15:07.381 --> 01:15:09.671
Now it is starting.

01:15:34.422 --> 01:15:36.970
The old man is not the same
since he met him.

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:39.581
I guess he did not suspect him
and that's weird. fucking

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.159
You are paranoid.
- Do you think?

01:15:41.178 --> 01:15:42.792
Well, he's not going after him.

01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:45.090
He says, let the dust settle
and then we'll see what happens.

01:15:45.109 --> 01:15:50.074
Perhaps it lead him to you.
- Time you to do something, junior.

01:15:50.163 --> 01:15:53.355
Show that you are a leader.
Take the fight to him.

01:15:53.374 --> 01:15:55.480
Do not let him take the initiative.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:59.055
We're in this together, right?

01:16:00.766 --> 01:16:03.542
You're right behind me, is not it?
- Of course.

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:06.687
You switch from Ferris
as we agreed.

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:11.953
I put the old man to
and then we go together.

01:16:14.262 --> 01:16:19.304
I can not get to him.
He is careful when he comes out.

01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:23.694
Lure him out.

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:39.744
Damn, what is this?
- Can we talk?

01:16:39.764 --> 01:16:43.712
Do I have a choice?
- I want you to pass a message.

01:16:53.896 --> 01:16:56.506
That's enough.

01:17:10.822 --> 01:17:12.832
What happened?
- Junior Thompson.

01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:14.770
It was with a bunch.
- Your father is right, mate.

01:17:14.789 --> 01:17:16.287
Look what has cuts, bruises
and a broken arm

01:17:16.306 --> 01:17:18.781
but he's as tough as an old leather.
- He was lucky, thank God.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.869
He's a fucking citizen.
- I know.

01:17:20.888 --> 01:17:23.173
Listen, McGraw has
also had with Fatboy.

01:17:23.192 --> 01:17:26.729
He wants a meeting.
- Paul, should we regulate today?

01:17:26.748 --> 01:17:29.782
Do nothing, guard the house.

01:17:50.267 --> 01:17:52.077
What?

01:17:55.305 --> 01:17:57.166
Do you have something to say?

01:18:00.438 --> 01:18:05.332
Fuck you, both of you.

01:18:05.854 --> 01:18:11.233
Fuck you, get out.
Hurry.

01:18:20.066 --> 01:18:22.858
See this?
Here.

01:18:23.767 --> 01:18:26.195
This is my hit list.

01:18:28.102 --> 01:18:32.324
And top of the list, Ferris.

01:18:38.036 --> 01:18:41.164
I want you to know,
I'm with you, Paul.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.526
He has crossed the border,
he has gone too far.

01:18:45.548 --> 01:18:47.959
Who can you trust when your
own people can not trust?

01:18:48.032 --> 01:18:50.006
Is that so?

01:18:50.627 --> 01:18:53.739
It does not matter to him,
coke in his nose

01:18:53.759 --> 01:18:55.955
challenge everyone to get involved with him.

01:18:57.407 --> 01:19:02.888
Where is he?
- Everyone has respect for the Godfather.

01:19:02.907 --> 01:19:04.942
Who does he think he is?

01:19:06.693 --> 01:19:09.054
Damn little asshole.

01:19:11.336 --> 01:19:15.542
He will sleep with the fishes
is over for the day.

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:19.479
I guarantee you fuck.
Ferris

01:19:19.693 --> 01:19:24.239
Johnny Davis, Jimmy Pearson, Glover

01:19:24.258 --> 01:19:29.032
and Harlan, are all dead, you hear me?

01:19:29.051 --> 01:19:33.756
And anyone with ties
with that bastard, going the same way.

01:19:33.779 --> 01:19:37.746
Fatboy, I'm coming to get you.
Where is he?

01:19:37.765 --> 01:19:39.750
I do not know, he's not here.

01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:54.639
No, you do not, I'll walk.
It's just a little bit.

01:19:54.658 --> 01:19:56.813
That's not a good idea, boss.

01:20:00.284 --> 01:20:03.826
Remember who you
damn it works, you unconvincing.

01:20:06.258 --> 01:20:08.386
I'm not afraid of anybody.

01:20:09.812 --> 01:20:12.416
I'm not afraid of anyone, yes?

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:19.458
Look at your face.

01:20:38.336 --> 01:20:41.046
Tell your father that he'll
a lesson, you fucking asshole.

01:20:41.065 --> 01:20:45.589
Father, please.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.108
Please.

01:20:54.387 --> 01:20:56.926
Paul, get in the car.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.793
No.

01:21:25.121 --> 01:21:28.647
My Child.

01:21:46.362 --> 01:21:49.882
We have witnesses who heard
that your name was called.

01:21:50.116 --> 01:21:51.755
The old man said it was you.

01:21:51.775 --> 01:21:54.471
He said you also wanted to murder him.

01:21:55.336 --> 01:21:58.929
He has made a statement
and he will testify.

01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:02.691
You are using this time, young man.

01:22:05.047 --> 01:22:07.844
You're stuck without bail
to the process.

01:22:08.379 --> 01:22:13.382
I feel that I owe them something.
I could not find those bastards.

01:22:16.597 --> 01:22:19.609
I can not believe that Arthur,
has shown me to the police.

01:22:21.232 --> 01:22:24.599
Usually, we arrange these things among us.
He knows the rules.

01:22:24.618 --> 01:22:28.622
He made them.
- Yes, for his own convenience.

01:22:28.889 --> 01:22:31.138
Paul, that man is a crook.

01:22:32.478 --> 01:22:36.383
How is Anne Marie?
- She's still upset.

01:22:36.674 --> 01:22:39.619
It'll be fine with her, she comes
get over it, they have to.

01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:44.399
Listen Paul, newspapers
have you actually been convicted.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:47.781
But that can work to your advantage.

01:22:59.172 --> 01:23:01.783
The last pub still,
I was beginning to be.

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:05.916
This is not so important anyway.
- Who we actually meet?

01:23:05.935 --> 01:23:08.810
I need to get some money for
a small job that I did.

01:23:08.829 --> 01:23:13.424
It would be a nice bedragje be.
So that will be fun later.

01:23:13.443 --> 01:23:17.242
Here deflect to the right size
and stop there, but on the left.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:27.308
How is George?
- Hello, fine, and you?

01:23:29.161 --> 01:23:31.565
Joe?

01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:48.101
What do you think?
-. I do not know

01:23:48.214 --> 01:23:50.644
It is serious information
that Paul can help.

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:55.482
Do you trust them?
-. Course I do not trust them

01:23:56.070 --> 01:24:00.224
Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, you stay here.

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:03.433
There is enough paranoia, we want
those bastards do not scare.

01:24:04.148 --> 01:24:07.348
It'll be okay.
- All right, mate. "

01:24:13.475 --> 01:24:15.566
Tam is there?
He's expecting me.

01:24:15.585 --> 01:24:17.857
Do you have a weapon on you?
- No.

01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:19.930
Can I just check?

01:24:26.721 --> 01:24:28.597
Go inside.

01:25:05.272 --> 01:25:07.196
Tam?

01:25:30.477 --> 01:25:32.079
Tam?

01:25:33.614 --> 01:25:35.525
Tam, are you here?

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.987
You coming in?
Your size is asking for you.

01:25:59.012 --> 01:26:01.056
Yeah, okay size.

01:26:03.123 --> 01:26:05.026
Because of this, right?
- Yes.

01:26:07.178 --> 01:26:09.056
What the hell?

01:26:25.633 --> 01:26:29.459
I bury my son tomorrow.

01:26:29.655 --> 01:26:33.613
I wanted to be sure,
that you would be there. well

01:26:34.241 --> 01:26:36.463
This will not change anything.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:40.548
Eye for an eye.
- McGraw?

01:26:40.567 --> 01:26:44.272
Damn, for God's sake.

01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.108
How are you guys?

01:26:47.124 --> 01:26:49.538
Get the colÃ¨re, Arthur Thompson.

01:26:51.563 --> 01:26:53.832
No, damn it.

01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:16.917
Four Victims In A Gang War.

01:28:33.586 --> 01:28:37.441
Motherfucker.

01:28:37.967 --> 01:28:42.239
What you dream?
I dream that one day

01:28:42.258 --> 01:28:45.909
when we are old, we all
will be together.

01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:49.209
We live in a big golden castle.

01:28:49.228 --> 01:28:53.685
We are kings and fighting
against monsters and demons.

01:28:53.704 --> 01:28:56.859
We are a country without the Banks brothers.
- Yes.

01:28:56.897 --> 01:29:00.487
A beautiful country with knights
with a shining armor.

01:29:00.506 --> 01:29:05.495
We are richer than your wildest dreams.
More than my mother of bingo.

01:29:05.623 --> 01:29:08.812
But the best thing is that we are happy.
A country without aggressive men.

01:29:08.832 --> 01:29:12.104
Yes, and we can all go to the big
tits Lisa Boyue look.

01:29:12.123 --> 01:29:15.839
Forever and ever.
And we live happily ever after.

01:29:15.866 --> 01:29:19.531
Till death do us part.

01:29:42.996 --> 01:29:47.037
I swear on my mother's grave
I had nothing to do with Paul.

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:51.489
What can I say?
I'm shocked.

01:29:51.662 --> 01:29:55.962
Ripped open, it's not good.

01:29:55.981 --> 01:30:00.529
to kill because he wants to touch you. man
Damn.

01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:03.099
It is a travesty.

01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:05.998
I only wanted a
and another right turn, Paul.

01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:09.308
Let you know that I'm with you,
all 100%.

01:30:12.204 --> 01:30:16.002
I'm that old address for you,
God is my witness.

01:30:20.799 --> 01:30:25.318
What?
- I know.

01:30:26.785 --> 01:30:28.534
You know what, Paul?

01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:33.560
I know, damn it.
- What the hell do you know?

01:30:33.579 --> 01:30:37.677
You, fucking bastard, you.

01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:43.205
You're the devil.
All this was not necessary.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.933
There was plenty for everyone.

01:30:47.855 --> 01:30:51.941
But you wanted it all for yourself,
you greedy bastard, is not it?

01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:59.198
We will see what it will cost.

01:31:00.996 --> 01:31:05.200
The fact is, right?
It has always been.

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.278
You and I, we are the same.
We all are.

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:11.862
If I was not, you know,
the old man, Johnny

01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:14.018
Jimmy, I do not know who.

01:31:14.508 --> 01:31:17.316
It is a big bad world
there, friend.

01:31:17.336 --> 01:31:19.949
Who dares wins.

01:31:23.263 --> 01:31:25.307
Okay.

01:31:26.684 --> 01:31:28.990
There is one thing I do not understand.

01:31:30.673 --> 01:31:33.272
Why did not you kill me? Fatboy

01:31:34.094 --> 01:31:35.976
Simple really.

01:31:36.776 --> 01:31:40.073
You're a pro, you had your
never let you get.

01:31:48.716 --> 01:31:50.615
You're dead.

01:31:52.737 --> 01:31:57.500
I'm coming to get you.
- No, if you ever come here.

01:31:57.519 --> 01:32:00.203
You have life, boy.

01:32:00.996 --> 01:32:03.074
What happens, happens.

01:32:03.921 --> 01:32:06.156
I'll come see you.

01:32:09.802 --> 01:32:11.763
Sleep well, Tam.

01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:14.004
Who do you think you're not, little man?

01:32:14.023 --> 01:32:17.120
You think you can threaten me?
I am now the governor.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.888
I will personally ensure
that your life does.

01:32:19.907 --> 01:32:24.434
Do you hear me, little man?
I have more connections than you know.

01:32:24.454 --> 01:32:27.967
You sit still life, you dick.

01:32:33.902 --> 01:32:37.647
Paul Ferris, are you afraid for your life
Now you're outside again?

01:32:37.666 --> 01:32:40.357
No, not at all.
- How does it feel to be acquitted

01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:43.512
for the murder of Junior Thompson
and the assassination

01:32:43.531 --> 01:32:46.430
on Arthur, the Godfather, Thompson?
- I'm being framed from the beginning

01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:48.662
and it is no doubt
proven in court.

01:32:48.682 --> 01:32:50.777
What do you mean with being framed?

01:32:50.796 --> 01:32:55.419
The police lied, witnesses lied,
but worst of all

01:32:55.438 --> 01:32:59.687
is that drawn letters having me
depicted as a paid informant.

01:32:59.875 --> 01:33:03.071
Those letters were only made for a purpose.

01:33:03.468 --> 01:33:05.454
To serve as. My death sentence

01:33:05.475 --> 01:33:07.463
To portray as a traitor to me.

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:10.910
Loyalty to all that I had
of taking. myself

01:33:18.323 --> 01:33:20.952
I never said that I
something other than what I am.

01:33:21.234 --> 01:33:23.892
I have the murder of Junior Thompson
not committed.

01:33:24.087 --> 01:33:27.574
But Arthur Thompson to the witness stand
climbed and testified against me

01:33:27.593 --> 01:33:30.567
I had nothing but respect for that man.

01:33:30.593 --> 01:33:34.681
But now I know how he really is.
He is a mercenary.

01:33:34.741 --> 01:33:37.629
A lying police informant.

01:33:39.931 --> 01:33:42.389
That man is out
in order to protect themselves.

01:33:42.408 --> 01:33:47.240
Anything else, Paul?
- No, that's enough.

01:33:47.542 --> 01:33:50.480
It's over, I'm going home.

01:34:12.769 --> 01:34:15.449
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:20.036
Get the colÃ¨re, Ferris.

01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:22.795
Yes, sir?
- May I have another?

01:34:22.814 --> 01:34:26.249
Make it a double, please.
- Please, sir.

01:34:26.268 --> 01:34:27.822
Thank you.

01:34:29.302 --> 01:34:33.423
Excuse me, I must also
two whiskeys, please?

01:34:33.451 --> 01:34:37.058
How do we come to Tenerife?
- In about two hours, sir.

01:35:10.797 --> 01:35:14.084
A year later

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:43.838
I've never hurt so much in my life

01:35:43.857 --> 01:35:46.561
fear and desolation felt.

01:35:46.573 --> 01:35:49.103
The loss of my son.

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.892
They say that those who live with violence
by violence will die.

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:59.892
Those who condemn be condemned.
It happens in our world.

01:35:59.967 --> 01:36:02.494
The way we do things.

01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:05.694
I accepted without question.

01:36:05.913 --> 01:36:09.821
Until fate knocked on my door.

01:36:10.207 --> 01:36:13.076
Some people believe
that fate is predestined.

01:36:13.127 --> 01:36:14.916
I'm not so sure.

01:36:15.104 --> 01:36:17.955
I think we choose our own path.

01:36:18.098 --> 01:36:21.322
Arthur was a gangster
and did terrible things.

01:36:21.454 --> 01:36:23.354
I do not do different for me than what I am.

01:36:23.374 --> 01:36:28.199
And right or wrong, I really believed in
a world with a code and honor.

01:36:28.563 --> 01:36:31.065
There I was wrong, and many other things.

01:36:31.147 --> 01:36:36.408
I was blinded, but done is done
and that life is behind me.

01:36:36.862 --> 01:36:39.663
And I'm sure there are people
who think that I can not change.

01:36:39.819 --> 01:36:41.710
And to be honest,
I can not blame them.

01:36:41.901 --> 01:36:43.590
We'll see.

01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:46.290
Anne Marie and Paul
have since divorced.

01:36:49.324 --> 01:36:54.293
After several attacks Arthur died
