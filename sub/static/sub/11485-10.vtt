WEBVTT

00:03.887 --> 00:07.118
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Picking out a shirt.

00:07.524 --> 00:08.786
That one looks nice.

00:08.858 --> 00:10.382
- You like it?
- Yeah.

00:10.493 --> 00:11.551
Then, no.

00:13.496 --> 00:14.622
Okay.

00:14.698 --> 00:18.657
Listen, I was wondering,
do you have any plans for Thanksgiving?

00:18.735 --> 00:22.501
- Alan, I don't think that far ahead.
- It's this Thursday.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.500
No kidding.

00:25.575 --> 00:28.373
Didn't we just get through
that whole pumpkin,

00:28.445 --> 00:30.436
the costume thing with the kid?

00:30.513 --> 00:31.912
- Halloween?
- Yeah.

00:33.149 --> 00:34.514
Three weeks ago.

00:35.085 --> 00:38.111
- No, I got no plans. Why?
- I was thinking,

00:38.188 --> 00:40.418
Jake's gonna be with his mom
and her parents,

00:40.490 --> 00:42.458
and I thought,
maybe you and I could do something.

00:42.525 --> 00:44.823
Okay, want to go to Vegas?

00:44.894 --> 00:47.863
I was thinking something
a little more traditional.

00:47.931 --> 00:49.023
Reno?

00:50.200 --> 00:53.897
- Charlie, it's a family holiday.
- Yeah, so, I'm your family.

00:54.003 --> 00:56.437
Unless you want to spend
a perfectly good Thursday

00:56.539 --> 00:59.064
with "Mom, The Impaler. "

00:59.175 --> 01:02.872
- Think we can get into the Bellagio?
- Leave it to me.

01:03.346 --> 01:05.108
That one's nice.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.518
Here's what we'll do.

01:10.587 --> 01:12.817
We'll fly to Vegas,
have a big steak dinner,

01:12.889 --> 01:15.084
get you a lap dance
and a bucket of nickels.

01:15.191 --> 01:18.456
- What are the nickels for?
- I'll explain it on the plane.

01:19.062 --> 01:23.260
That sounds kind of fun.
Two single guys, rocking out in Vegas,

01:23.366 --> 01:26.961
- the glitz, the glamour...
- Dude, don't gay it up.

01:32.909 --> 01:35.878
You know, I like this shirt much better.

01:35.945 --> 01:38.243
Stop screwing with me, Alan.

01:39.082 --> 01:41.243
So, who's the lucky gal?

01:41.317 --> 01:44.650
- Remember Lisa?
- Lisa-who-used-to-live-here, Lisa?

01:44.754 --> 01:48.121
She lived here, she moved out,
she lived here, I moved out.

01:49.626 --> 01:53.460
At one point, neither one of us lived here.
Yeah, that Lisa.

01:53.563 --> 01:56.623
Wow.
So, she's gonna take you back again?

01:56.900 --> 01:59.164
Hey, who said she's the one
who broke up with...

01:59.269 --> 02:00.668
Yeah, I'm hoping.

02:01.504 --> 02:03.404
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

02:06.843 --> 02:09.573
I've completely lost confidence
in this shirt.

02:17.287 --> 02:20.256
- Hey, Lees! Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.948
How many times did you change
your shirt before you left the house?

02:24.594 --> 02:28.155
- I wanted to look pretty for you.
- You're such a girl.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.497
Thanks, you, too.

02:32.302 --> 02:35.203
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

02:38.708 --> 02:42.542
So, you want to just blow this place
and get a room?

02:44.547 --> 02:46.310
- I can't.
- Why not?

02:46.549 --> 02:48.073
I'm getting married.

02:50.186 --> 02:52.154
Yeah. Ha, ha. Me, too.

02:53.690 --> 02:57.490
- I'm not kidding.
- You can't do that, you love me.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.187
That's not the point.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.696
I'm tired of doing this dance of death
with you.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.096
Hooking up, breaking up, making up.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.601
That's not a dance of death.
That's the circle of life.

03:09.239 --> 03:12.572
It may be your life, but it's not mine.
Not anymore.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.373
- I'm moving on.
- To what?

03:15.511 --> 03:19.072
To settling down, to having a family,

03:19.182 --> 03:23.846
to not having my heart constantly broken
by a man who refuses to grow up.

03:24.554 --> 03:26.078
And that would be me?

03:27.523 --> 03:30.219
Yes, you, you big ass.

03:32.528 --> 03:34.962
But the sex was awesome though, right?

03:36.199 --> 03:38.429
Yes, it was.
But there's more to relationships...

03:38.534 --> 03:42.265
- Is it awesome with your fiancÃ©?
- None of your business.

03:42.372 --> 03:44.602
It's not, is it?

03:44.707 --> 03:46.607
God, why did I call you?

03:46.943 --> 03:48.274
I'll tell you why.

03:48.378 --> 03:51.870
Because in your heart, you know
you're about to make a huge mistake

03:51.948 --> 03:53.779
and you want me to talk you out of it.

03:53.883 --> 03:57.444
No, I was hoping you and I
could have some closure.

03:57.553 --> 04:01.922
Then I refer you back to my suggestion
that we blow this place and get a room.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.093
Same old Charlie.

04:07.263 --> 04:10.460
What if I wasn't?
Would you still be marrying this clown?

04:10.566 --> 04:12.056
Bo is not a clown.

04:12.268 --> 04:13.792
- Bo?
- Bo.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.130
I'm sorry, Bo-Bo is a clown.

04:18.774 --> 04:21.403
Charlie, you'll never change.

04:21.476 --> 04:24.810
Look at you, a grown man
who can't even commit to long pants.

04:24.914 --> 04:28.907
Hey, I can commit to long pants.
I was just focused on the shirt today.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.812
And for your information,
I've gone through changes

04:31.921 --> 04:34.287
like you wouldn't believe
since the last time we were together.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.815
- Like what?
- Well, I have a kid now.

04:38.795 --> 04:42.196
God, Charlie,
what poor girl did you knock up?

04:43.299 --> 04:46.325
No. It's my nephew.
He and my brother are living with me now.

04:46.436 --> 04:50.873
- I'm like, Mr. Family Guy.
- Yeah, right, "Family Guy. "

04:51.774 --> 04:53.935
How's it going with your mom?

04:54.010 --> 04:56.672
What the hell's my mom
got to do with family?

04:58.181 --> 05:00.149
Come on, Charlie, we both know

05:00.216 --> 05:04.209
you'll never have a successful relationship
with any woman, let alone me,

05:04.320 --> 05:07.448
until you resolve your issues
with your mother.

05:07.523 --> 05:08.615
Well,

05:09.392 --> 05:12.623
as a matter of fact, it just so happens

05:12.795 --> 05:15.195
on that note, since you mentioned it,

05:16.966 --> 05:21.062
- those issues are resolved.
- Really. How'd that happen?

05:22.405 --> 05:26.239
You know,
communication, self-reflection,

05:26.342 --> 05:29.402
personal growth, crap like that.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.379
The important thing is,
I now have a much deeper appreciation

05:34.484 --> 05:37.578
for what do you call them,
traditional values.

05:37.687 --> 05:39.587
"Traditional values?"

05:39.689 --> 05:41.919
This from a guy
who offered my sister a car

05:42.025 --> 05:43.583
if she'd come to bed with us?

05:46.662 --> 05:48.755
It was a joke, and I was drunk.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.060
But still, it shows a yearning for family.

05:55.705 --> 05:59.539
- Okay, this is going nowhere.
- Lisa, wait. I'm sorry.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.601
I don't want you to
not be in my life anymore.

06:02.678 --> 06:04.612
I'd like us to be friends.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.711
- I'd like that, too.
- Good.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.083
- So when are you getting married?
- We haven't set a date.

06:10.186 --> 06:13.553
We're gonna talk about it when Bo
gets back from New York on Monday.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.615
- So, you're all alone for Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, why?

06:22.765 --> 06:24.130
Change of plans.

06:32.442 --> 06:34.103
What's so tough to understand?

06:34.177 --> 06:37.010
We're gonna have
a big family dinner right here.

06:37.847 --> 06:40.839
And whose big family
were you planning on inviting?

06:41.117 --> 06:44.917
You know, you, me, Jake, Mom, turkey,
just like the good old days.

06:45.588 --> 06:47.078
What good old days?

06:47.757 --> 06:50.487
It's just an expression,
don't get hung up on it.

06:50.593 --> 06:53.824
- Oh, and Lisa might come.
- Okay, what's going on?

06:53.930 --> 06:57.696
- I need to show Lisa that I'm a family guy.
- But you're not.

06:59.368 --> 07:00.835
That's not the point.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.261
She's about to go off
and marry some jerk

07:03.339 --> 07:06.035
just because he loves her
and wants to settle down.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.366
I get it, you're Satan.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.713
Alan, this is serious.
I could lose her forever.

07:13.950 --> 07:15.850
Wow, and you care?

07:16.953 --> 07:18.113
I love her, Alan.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.953
She's the only one I ever thought
I might eventually wind up with.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.356
"Eventually wind up with. "

07:26.329 --> 07:27.523
I'm touched.

07:28.798 --> 07:31.790
So you want to, what,
keep her warming up in your bullpen

07:31.868 --> 07:35.133
until the bottom of the ninth
when you lose your arm?

07:39.041 --> 07:41.669
Okay,
I don't know how we got onto sports,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.006
but the thing is, I really care for Lisa

07:45.081 --> 07:47.572
and she needs to believe
I'm capable of changing.

07:47.683 --> 07:49.674
But the thing is, you're not.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.352
You don't know that. I might be.

07:53.422 --> 07:56.152
Who knows what would happen
if I actually tried.

07:56.325 --> 07:58.259
You're really serious about this.

07:58.361 --> 08:01.387
Alan, I've got a 200-pound turkey
melting in my lap.

08:02.598 --> 08:05.761
- What do you think?
- Okay, how can I help?

08:06.736 --> 08:10.331
Obviously, we can't have a family
Thanksgiving without a kid.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.204
So you need to get Jake back
from your wife.

08:14.177 --> 08:15.439
Simple as that?

08:15.845 --> 08:17.938
Okay, so I go to Judith and I say,

08:18.047 --> 08:20.675
"Forget the fact
that we agreed on a custody schedule,

08:20.750 --> 08:24.049
"forget that your parents
are driving all the way from Sacramento

08:24.120 --> 08:28.216
"to spend time with their grandson.
Charlie needs to use our son as a prop

08:28.291 --> 08:31.260
"so he that can maintain
an on-again-off-again relationship

08:31.360 --> 08:34.419
"with a woman with whom
he might eventually wind up. "

08:36.933 --> 08:39.299
- You know what, I'll talk to her.
- Yeah.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.732
No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

08:43.039 --> 08:44.939
Okay, maybe I didn't explain it correctly.

08:45.041 --> 08:48.101
You explained it fine.
You're not taking Jake for Thanksgiving.

08:48.211 --> 08:50.702
Not just Jake.
You can come, too, and your parents.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.305
Think of it, the whole family,
just like the good old days.

08:53.382 --> 08:55.009
What good old days?

08:56.052 --> 08:58.452
Why is everybody so damn literal?

08:59.288 --> 09:02.121
Judith, what is Thanksgiving about,
if not family?

09:02.225 --> 09:05.922
Wouldn't it be good for Jake to spend
Thanksgiving with his whole family,

09:06.028 --> 09:10.590
because that's what
Thanksgiving is about, family and stuff.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.293
- I don't know.
- You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

09:15.404 --> 09:18.896
I'll have someone there to do the cooking,
the serving, and the cleaning.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.136
- Really? Who?
- My housekeeper, Berta.

09:21.244 --> 09:23.940
She's a saint,
and she's really looking forward to this.

09:24.113 --> 09:27.776
No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

09:28.217 --> 09:31.277
- Come on.
- I don't work holidays, Charlie.

09:31.387 --> 09:33.719
- Please.
- I've got a life, you know.

09:33.789 --> 09:34.915
Pretty, please.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.425
My brother is in
the Witness Protection Program,

09:37.493 --> 09:39.461
and I've been invited to spend
Thanksgiving with him

09:39.528 --> 09:41.325
at an undisclosed location.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.266
- I'll give you $1,000.
- Done.

09:52.742 --> 09:55.677
- Hi, you must be Jake.
- Yes, I am.

09:55.778 --> 09:58.269
My wonderful Uncle Charlie
has opened his home

09:58.347 --> 10:01.180
to me and my father
'cause we had nowhere else to go.

10:05.454 --> 10:07.513
Hey, Merry Thanksgiving.

10:13.462 --> 10:15.794
I like what you've done with the place.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.924
You picked out everything here.

10:18.501 --> 10:21.834
I know.
Just wanted to make sure you did.

10:22.138 --> 10:25.130
Charlie, I've got to admit,
I never thought I'd see the day

10:25.207 --> 10:27.505
when you'd be hosting
a family Thanksgiving.

10:27.610 --> 10:29.771
Like I've been telling you, I've changed.

10:29.845 --> 10:31.278
So, with that in mind,

10:31.347 --> 10:33.508
you wanna blow this place
and get a room?

10:33.616 --> 10:38.383
- Charlie, stop it. Come on, introduce me.
- Fine.

10:38.487 --> 10:41.456
Lisa, this is Judith,
my former sister-in-law,

10:41.524 --> 10:43.583
- but still, you know, family.
- Hi.

10:43.693 --> 10:45.661
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.992
And these, of course,
are her wonderful parents,

10:48.064 --> 10:51.158
- Sherman and Lorraine.
- Sheldon and Lenore.

10:51.534 --> 10:54.059
Sheldon and Lenore.
It's great to see you, folks.

10:54.170 --> 10:58.106
- So, Shelley, how you liking California?
- We live in California.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.572
So you must really like it.

11:01.377 --> 11:05.245
- Hi, Lisa. So nice to see you again.
- Hi, Alan, long time.

11:05.348 --> 11:08.181
See, isn't this great?
This is why we all come together.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.877
We break up, we make up,

11:09.952 --> 11:13.615
but in the end, the love is the love
and the family is the family.

11:14.023 --> 11:15.957
Ease up on the wine, Charlie.

11:17.293 --> 11:20.729
No, he's right, and Alan,
Sheldon and I want you to know

11:20.796 --> 11:23.788
that even though you and our daughter
are no longer married,

11:23.899 --> 11:26.299
we will always think of you as our son.

11:26.569 --> 11:28.935
What the hell's
that supposed to mean, Ma?

11:29.071 --> 11:31.733
It means that, even though
you loused up your marriage,

11:31.807 --> 11:33.069
we still love him.

11:33.142 --> 11:35.770
Thanks a lot, Dad. I appreciate the blame.

11:35.878 --> 11:38.870
This is really Judith's family.
Let's go find mine.

11:40.916 --> 11:44.283
- Hey, Berta. Look who's here.
- Hi, Berta.

11:44.387 --> 11:47.550
Honey,
don't tell me you're back here again.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.215
Don't you ever learn?

11:50.092 --> 11:52.492
As a matter of fact, I think I have.

11:52.728 --> 11:55.162
Good for you. You can do so much better.

11:59.301 --> 12:03.260
And remember,
you may have two grandmothers,

12:03.372 --> 12:07.206
but only one of them has enough money
to send you to medical school.

12:07.643 --> 12:10.111
What if I don't want to go
to medical school?

12:10.212 --> 12:12.237
Then you'd break
your grandmommy's heart

12:12.314 --> 12:15.249
- just like your father did.
- Dad's a doctor.

12:16.118 --> 12:19.918
No, sweetheart.
Your father's a chiropractor.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.389
That's a masseuse without the hot oil.

12:23.459 --> 12:26.451
- Go play with your friends.
- I'm the only kid here.

12:26.562 --> 12:29.497
You might want to think about
why that is.

12:32.435 --> 12:33.902
I want more money.

12:35.938 --> 12:37.405
Hey, Mom.

12:37.473 --> 12:39.907
You remember Lisa, right?
We used to live together.

12:39.975 --> 12:43.138
No, I don't. I'm sorry. Hello, dear.

12:43.312 --> 12:46.110
My son has had so many little roommates.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.981
I just hope you've got better taste

12:50.085 --> 12:52.986
than the one who picked out
his hideous furniture.

12:56.425 --> 12:59.360
Hey, who's got unresolved issues
with her now?

13:00.529 --> 13:03.623
Did it ever occur to you
that you might want to support me,

13:03.699 --> 13:07.601
- your daughter?
- Why can't we support Alan, too?

13:07.937 --> 13:12.203
- Because I'm divorcing him.
- Who told you to go and do that?

13:14.009 --> 13:15.169
It's very sweet of you

13:15.277 --> 13:17.677
to go to all this trouble,
but who are you kidding?

13:17.780 --> 13:21.443
The plaid shirt,
the sweater vest, the kid actor.

13:21.517 --> 13:23.644
No, that's really my nephew.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.651
I love you, Charlie,
but you're not gonna change my mind.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.655
- Live with me.
- Charlie.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.389
- No, I'm serious. Move back in.
- Really? And then what?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.461
And then, we'll see.

13:36.999 --> 13:40.196
Wow, a commitment to "see. "

13:40.569 --> 13:43.697
And what finger does that ring go on,
Charlie?

13:44.740 --> 13:47.402
- You know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

13:47.510 --> 13:50.206
You want me to waste
a couple of more years of my life

13:50.312 --> 13:53.042
on a relationship
that's absolutely doomed to fail.

13:53.148 --> 13:55.639
Not your life, our life.

13:58.153 --> 14:01.554
Look, I appreciate your feelings for me,
but I have to tell you,

14:01.657 --> 14:04.251
I really think your daughter deserves
a lot of respect.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.659
It takes real courage to make changes
in your life and not worry

14:07.730 --> 14:10.130
- about what everybody thinks.
- Thank you, Alan.

14:10.199 --> 14:11.257
That's true.

14:11.333 --> 14:15.531
The lesbians of my generation
were too scared to come out of the closet.

14:22.077 --> 14:23.942
Does that mean what I think it means?

14:24.046 --> 14:26.276
- You haven't told them?
- No.

14:26.382 --> 14:29.681
I thought it would be more appropriate
coming from your mother.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.382
<i>I'm sorry, did I faux pas?</i>

14:35.057 --> 14:37.890
- Yes, just get her out of here.
- Mom...

14:40.296 --> 14:41.854
What was I thinking?

14:46.602 --> 14:48.092
Happy Thanksgiving.

14:49.271 --> 14:52.638
Sorry I'm late,
but I didn't realize you're having a party.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.234
- Hi, I'm Rose.
- Hi.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.747
Don't worry. Charlie and I had sex once,
but now we're just friends.

15:00.082 --> 15:01.982
Who's ready for mystery pie?

15:03.953 --> 15:06.217
If you were living here,
these kinds of things

15:06.288 --> 15:08.119
probably wouldn't happen.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.074

Here it is.

15:24.206 --> 15:25.901
Berta, nice looking bird,

15:25.975 --> 15:29.206
thanks for blowing off your family
and cooking for ours.

15:29.878 --> 15:31.072
Shove over.

15:33.315 --> 15:36.978
Are we gonna go around the table
and say what we're thankful for?

15:39.421 --> 15:41.321
Me, I got one.

15:42.291 --> 15:46.318
I'm thankful for the food we eat,
and thankful for the friends we meet.

15:46.629 --> 15:49.223
I'm thankful for my comfy seat.

15:49.498 --> 15:53.400
I'm thankful for the birdie's feet.

15:55.304 --> 15:59.638
<i>White with foam, God bless America</i>

15:59.742 --> 16:01.573
- Pull up, Rose.
- Sorry.

16:03.445 --> 16:05.436
- Jake, why don't you go?
- Okay.

16:05.781 --> 16:08.978
I'm thankful for my mom and dad,
and my Uncle Charlie,

16:09.151 --> 16:12.848
"who has shown in the few short months
that I've been here

16:12.955 --> 16:15.150
"that he is capable of... "

16:15.591 --> 16:16.819
Significant.

16:16.925 --> 16:19.120
"... significant change and growth. "

16:23.165 --> 16:24.996
- Too obvious?
- Little bit.

16:26.268 --> 16:30.637
Okay, well, I'm thankful
that I can spend the holiday with

16:30.939 --> 16:34.875
all the people I love,
and all the people who love me,

16:36.011 --> 16:37.171
and Judith.

16:40.616 --> 16:43.949
I'm thankful I'll be dead someday
and you'll all feel horrible

16:44.019 --> 16:45.714
you weren't nicer to me.

16:48.857 --> 16:50.688
And I'm thankful that our daughter

16:50.793 --> 16:53.694
gave us at least one grandchild
before she...

16:57.566 --> 16:59.557
I'm thankful I finally found a therapist

16:59.668 --> 17:03.035
who has no compunction
about prescribing powerful sedatives.

17:03.138 --> 17:06.335
I'm thankful I can sit here
and listen to you rich people whine

17:06.407 --> 17:10.367
while my family's scrabbling
for a corn dog at the Pomona Fairgrounds.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.342
- Charlie?
- No, you first.

17:22.057 --> 17:23.991
I'm thankful for you,

17:25.094 --> 17:27.493
and I hope you'll always be my friend.

17:28.697 --> 17:32.030
Okay, well, I'm thankful for you, too.

17:32.501 --> 17:35.902
And I'm thankful for everybody
coming together today

17:36.038 --> 17:39.064
as unwitting participants
in my desperate charade.

17:42.511 --> 17:43.603
Amen.

17:46.548 --> 17:49.176
Okay, maybe I should carve the turkey.

17:49.251 --> 17:50.684
I'll handle that for you, Son.

17:50.753 --> 17:53.517
- No, you both sit down. I'll do it.
- No, Mom, I can do it.

17:53.589 --> 17:54.783
No, don't be ridiculous.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.882
- No, I insist. I would love to.
- I appreciate the hospitality.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.190
Okay, everybody, stop!

18:01.263 --> 18:02.958
Mom, give me the knife.

18:03.766 --> 18:07.202
Charlie, don't be silly.
You don't know how to carve a turkey.

18:07.269 --> 18:09.533
Maybe not,
but I'm the head of this household,

18:09.605 --> 18:12.540
and the head of the household
is supposed to carve the turkey.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.906
Why, because you saw it
on some TV show?

18:14.977 --> 18:19.607
- I swear, you are just like your father.
- No, I am not just not like my father.

18:19.782 --> 18:22.307
My father was afraid of you, and I'm not

18:23.318 --> 18:24.444
<i>anymore:</i>

18:26.288 --> 18:28.620
Okay, there was one unresolved issue.

18:29.391 --> 18:33.054
Charlie, now you're being foolish.
Give me the knife and sit down.

18:33.128 --> 18:34.425
Back off, lady.

18:36.732 --> 18:39.963
Every Thanksgiving,
you took the knife away from Dad,

18:40.068 --> 18:42.901
and when you did that,
you took away his manhood.

18:43.138 --> 18:45.732
You're not gonna take it away from me.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.942
There, see, it's carved.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.049
It's carved with my manhood.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.088
I don't think I'm very hungry anymore.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.054
Lisa, marry me.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.990
- Marry you? You want me to marry you?
- Yes,

19:10.332 --> 19:12.095
you know, eventually.

19:18.207 --> 19:21.108
You sure you don't want
some turkey for the road?

19:21.343 --> 19:22.901
No, I'm fine.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.573
So, are you gonna invite me
to your wedding?

19:26.648 --> 19:28.138
Charlie.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.151
Will you at least call me
when you get divorced?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.084
You'll be first on my list.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.629
- For what it's worth, I do love you.
- I know that.

19:47.135 --> 19:50.036
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.006
You look good in long pants.

19:56.011 --> 19:57.137
Thanks.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.034
Charlie,

20:30.345 --> 20:32.210
we're still eating.

21:01.310 --> 21:02.538
