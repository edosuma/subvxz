00:57.960 --> 00:59.121
Hey, where you been?

00:59.240 --> 01:00.366
Just getting the mail.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.250
- What's for dinner?
- Champagne and caviar.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.964
Oh, shit, what'd I get?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.605
This is you in the middle.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.881
What are those, new kicks?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.047
Yeah, I think so.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.521
- Yo, 10 minutes, <i>Call of Duty.</i>
- You're on.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.080
- It's on, bitch.
- Hey, Kyle.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.282
Look what some creep sent me.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.009
What's going on, Princess?
This is you.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.208
What's up, kid?
That's you.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.802
Kinda feel like stilettos.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.890
Seriously, Kyle?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.247
I'm sorry. I'm just bringing your stuff.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.244
I went to the post office
for you, come on.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.765
That's sick.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.209
<i>All right, who wants to go
private tonight, huh?</i>

02:41.400 --> 02:44.051
<i>Come on, guys.
Keep me entertained.</i>

02:44.880 --> 02:47.565
<i>Just tell me what you're into
and we can go private.</i>

02:49.080 --> 02:50.445
<i>Ball gags.</i>

02:51.720 --> 02:54.803
<i>Yes, Sassy, I'm 18 years old.</i>

02:55.520 --> 02:57.443
<i>Is this your first time
going private?</i>

03:00.480 --> 03:02.448
<i>Whatever you're
in the mood for.</i>

03:02.800 --> 03:04.211
<i>You like my diamond, huh?</i>

03:08.440 --> 03:11.603
<i>Come on, Sassy.
What are you, some sort of chick?</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:13.561
<i>Huh?</i>

03:17.080 --> 03:18.320
<i>I love chicks.</i>

03:21.760 --> 03:25.128
<i>No, I have, actually,
I have lots of hot mommies and daddies.</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:27.809
<i>Did you see my wish list?</i>

03:30.200 --> 03:31.531
<i>That's how you can reward me.</i>

03:33.280 --> 03:34.725
Very clever.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.124
<i>You ask a lot
of questions, girl.</i>

03:41.080 --> 03:42.445
<i>Come on, baby,
what do you want?</i>

03:42.560 --> 03:43.925
<i>What do you want me to do, huh?</i>

03:44.000 --> 03:45.729
<i>Do you want me to jack off for you?
Is that it?</i>

03:45.800 --> 03:47.211
Oh, my God.

03:48.440 --> 03:53.002
<i>You want me to touch myself?
What are you in the mood for?</i>

03:54.280 --> 03:55.725
<i>So you don't.</i>

03:56.720 --> 03:59.007
<i>You don't wanna see me jack off</i>

03:59.120 --> 04:01.361
<i>or play with these toys
or anything?</i>

04:01.440 --> 04:04.444
<i>You really just wanna...
You just wanna chat.</i>

04:23.120 --> 04:24.246
Boo!

04:56.080 --> 04:57.684
Fucking muscle heads.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.081
- All the veins popping out of his biceps.
- Dude!

05:00.160 --> 05:01.730
- Yeah, but did you see...
- That was good, man.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.041
This is awesome.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.730
So fucked up, man.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.081
Here he goes.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.200
He's gonna get it.
He's gonna get it.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.368
- That's ours!
- It's ours? It's ours.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.923
- Can I help you? You sure?
- Yeah.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.401
Oh, my God!

06:37.360 --> 06:38.725
The fuck you looking at?

06:44.080 --> 06:46.924
<i>Don't do this at home
'cause it's really, really dangerous.</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:49.088
<i>And really, really stupid.</i>

06:52.960 --> 06:54.121
Is that real?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.451
That's nuts!

07:00.520 --> 07:04.241
This is a job, man. I put you in charge
of these stores and nothing's happening.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.840
Do you have any
kind of answer for me?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.325
I'm really tired
of this shit, man.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.290
Dr. Borland.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.207
Hi.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.686
Really.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.324
Well, we can try again
our next cycle, right?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.124
Thanks, Doctor.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.686
Hey.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.606
So, um...

07:38.880 --> 07:41.531
Dr. Borland said
we could try again.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.731
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.242
Can we talk about that
a little later?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.966
- I'm just running a little late.
- Yeah.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.880
<i>You'd be crazy
not to go for this Internet story.</i>

08:17.960 --> 08:19.450
You gotta remind me again.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.125
Kid. Online.
Chat room.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.329
I know. Look, I don't get it.
He sits there all day?

08:24.440 --> 08:26.408
No. No.
He goes private with people.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.528
He's a bright kid.
He's probably trapped.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.285
One minute. Nina, it just sounds so dark.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.407
It's more of a feature than what you're used to.
That's what I'm...

08:35.480 --> 08:36.640
- Thank you.
- I'm just...

08:36.720 --> 08:38.722
Look. There are thousands
of kids like this.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.929
I really think this
could be powerful, you know?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.206
It's got sex, it's got heart.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.362
Just let me try,
and I will not complain

08:48.480 --> 08:50.562
about sitting behind
this desk 24/7

08:50.640 --> 08:53.371
writing those fluff pieces you give me.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.210
Yes, you will.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.280
All right.
Dude, I found him. Ben Boyd.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.443
Says he's in 10th grade
at our school.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.960
- He's in our grade?
- Yeah.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.644
"Music is my passion.
Everything from Sigur Rós to Radiohead."

09:09.000 --> 09:10.490
What the hell is Sigur Rós?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.449
Who knows? What do we write?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.411
Okay. Write...

09:16.440 --> 09:20.126
"Hi, Ben, my name's Jessica.
I go to Ridgewood."

09:20.720 --> 09:22.927
"Sigur Rós is my fave."

09:23.160 --> 09:24.366
Say something about his song.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.323
Okay. Um...

09:27.840 --> 09:30.411
- "I loved your song on your page."
- All right.

09:30.960 --> 09:34.043
- "Your song was so amazing."
- "It touched me. It's amazing."

09:34.120 --> 09:37.442
- "It touched me." That's good.
- "It touched me."

09:39.160 --> 09:40.924
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.126
Hi, Mr. Dixon.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.520
I almost ran this over, genius.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.364
Uh... I'm sorry.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.004
- You're sorry?
- Yeah.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.244
- How was the game?
- Played like Gretzky.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.205
What are you guys doing?

09:53.320 --> 09:54.367
- Homework.
- Reports.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.250
- Homework?
- Homework.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.481
Homework or that?

09:57.640 --> 09:58.801
Homework on that.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.200
- I'm online.
- Okay. You didn't wear that shirt to school?

10:02.080 --> 10:03.764
- I wore this one over it?
- Yeah?

10:03.840 --> 10:04.921
Yeah.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.087
<i>Are you lying?</i>

10:06.160 --> 10:07.605
- Frye, am I lying?
- I was there.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.011
Yeah? All right.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.091
Frye, I only got
chicken for two,

10:11.160 --> 10:13.527
so you got to get
the hell out of my house.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.325
- Kidding, Frye.
- Oh.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.081
It's okay. My dad wants me home, anyway.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.885
All right, good.
I got two cases to get to, so come on.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.691
- Frye, it was good seeing you.
- You, too, sir.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.170
<i>Look at that.</i>

10:27.680 --> 10:30.126
<i>You know how much Daddy loves you?</i>

10:31.120 --> 10:32.406
<i>What's up, Mommy?</i>

10:37.160 --> 10:38.685
<i>Look at that.</i>

12:24.600 --> 12:28.366
The guy's got a non-compete
clause and it's pretty airtight.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.041
I understand that.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.647
What, are they just
gonna sue the guy and ask questions later?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.565
Right. Well, they can't do that.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.041
So, just have him call
McCortland & Partridge

12:39.120 --> 12:41.691
and we'll work something out, okay?

12:42.440 --> 12:45.523
Like a settlement, come on.
Put your fangs away.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.803
All right. Bye.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.770
Hey, kiddo, where's Mom?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.609
Hey, she's upstairs, I think.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.843
What about Mozart?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.968
At his piano. Where else?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.081
Huh.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.605
<i>Now what are you doing?</i>

13:52.000 --> 13:53.081
<i>Lean Cuisine again?</i>

13:54.360 --> 13:56.010
<i>You really need to mix it up.</i>

14:02.560 --> 14:04.369
<i>I'm a student of the world,
baby.</i>

14:04.680 --> 14:05.681
Mm-hmm.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.770
<i>I don't know.</i>

14:22.720 --> 14:25.929
<i>Fuck, no. Come on.</i>

14:27.080 --> 14:30.368
<i>Let's go cam-to-cam.
That way I get to see you, too.</i>

14:31.720 --> 14:34.769
<i>This isn't fair, come on.
Don't be shy.</i>

14:36.600 --> 14:38.011
<i>I'm not going to
charge you anything more.</i>

14:38.080 --> 14:40.128
<i>It costs the same price.
Come on.</i>

14:41.080 --> 14:42.730
<i>It's easy,
just click the button.</i>

14:45.440 --> 14:47.010
<i>- Hello?</i>

14:52.760 --> 14:54.330
<i>Wow. You're...</i>

14:55.600 --> 14:57.284
<i>You're really hot.</i>

14:57.800 --> 14:59.882
That's very sweet.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.726
<i>You're... You're smokin'.</i>

15:01.840 --> 15:03.126
Please. My God.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.928
You could be my little brother.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.963
<i>God, you are...
You're a MILF.</i>

15:08.600 --> 15:10.011
I'm a MILF?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.531
<i>No, maybe you're
not so much a MILF.</i>

15:11.600 --> 15:13.887
<i>Like, you're not a cougar yet,
'cause you're not that old.</i>

15:13.960 --> 15:15.928
<i>- You're like a puma.</i>
- What's a puma?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.282
<i>It's like the step
before a cougar.</i>

15:18.800 --> 15:21.963
That's really depressing.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.851
<i>You know what? Let's play a game.
For a million dollars,</i>

15:25.560 --> 15:29.360
<i>would you fuck a dirty,
smelly, hairy homeless guy?</i>

15:30.120 --> 15:32.202
Oh, my God, no.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.807
<i>- No? For a million dollars?</i>
- No!

15:35.480 --> 15:37.369
<i>- Okay, two million.</i>
- No.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.007
<i>Bullshit. Come on.
Five million. Five million.</i>

15:41.560 --> 15:42.641
Five million? Okay.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.846
<i>You see,
everybody has their price.</i>

15:47.840 --> 15:49.808
Okay, this is what he wrote.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.882
"Hey, thanks for
liking my song."

15:51.960 --> 15:55.248
"I was nervous
about posting it. I know, I'm weird."

15:56.440 --> 15:58.090
- Okay, say...
- Jason.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.162
What's up, Billy?
Say...

16:01.080 --> 16:05.529
- "I think weird is sexy."
- Oh, yeah, that's good.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.683
Perfect. Okay.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.688
- Did he get it?
- He got it.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.250
He's smiling!

16:17.520 --> 16:20.285
Mom, oh, my God,
the f-ing funniest thing happened today.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.283
Abigail, would you
stop that please?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.646
What?

16:23.720 --> 16:26.200
- F-ing. The f-ing thing.
- Sorry. Anyway...

16:26.560 --> 16:28.289
- You know that girl Malinda Goodman?
- No.

16:28.360 --> 16:32.922
Yeah, well, she had, like, this laser
treatment thing, you know, hair removal.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.727
Anyway, there can be this side effect
sometimes where you grow more hair.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.486
I know. I swear, the girl
has a fucking beard.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.005
- Hey.
- Sorry.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.730
Okay. That's enough.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.881
Hey, Ben.
Can you please not do that at the table?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.201
He is.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.885
This is an annoying client, that's
what this is. Dad is working.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.800
What is it, your girlfriend?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.251
His what?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.170
Girlfriend? Ben!

16:59.280 --> 17:00.850
It's just a friend.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.530
You type away.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.210
Now, is this
a friend from school?

17:04.720 --> 17:05.960
It's from Ridgewood.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.319
Freakwood.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.287
Guys, come on,
you're boring your mother and I.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.930
It's okay, I'm out, anyway.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.087
- What? Come on.
- Yeah. Me, too.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.845
Okay. Well, you're excused, both of you.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.604
- Well, Ben's officially there, huh?
- Where?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.844
He's at that age where
you have to pull every word out of him.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.684
He's 15. Oh.
I gotta take this.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.090
I was 17 before I started talking,
you know? Hey.

17:34.960 --> 17:40.444
Henry, I understand that. Listen,
that's your job, okay? Yeah, exactly.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.764
<i>So what do we talk about?</i>

17:54.840 --> 17:58.731
<i>State Senator Crisswell, who's backing
plans to stop the sign program</i>

17:58.800 --> 18:01.883
<i>and would join a dozen states
to stop using the sign.</i>

18:53.760 --> 18:54.841
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

18:54.920 --> 18:56.649
- How's El Paso?
<i>- Oh, it's great.</i>

18:57.160 --> 18:59.845
Um, have you used
the MasterCard for something?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.407
No.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.481
<i>Well, it got declined.</i>

19:03.280 --> 19:04.850
Did you max it out
or something?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.650
<i>No, of course not.</i>

19:08.200 --> 19:09.281
Is this why you're calling?

19:09.360 --> 19:10.725
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:15.325
Yeah. I want to know
why the credit card isn't working.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.249
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Great.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.524
<i>So now I'm in El Paso
with no credit card.</i>

19:21.040 --> 19:23.327
I'm sure it's a mistake, Derek.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.727
Just call the number
on the back of the card.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.882
- All right. All right, I'll talk to you later.
<i>- Okay.</i>

19:30.480 --> 19:31.811
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

21:12.880 --> 21:16.487
<i>Can you verify a $5,300
charge at Best Buy yesterday?</i>

21:16.600 --> 21:18.364
That's not possible.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.371
That's crazy.
There's gotta be a mistake.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.808
<i>A charge for $28
at Victoria's Secret two days ago.</i>

21:25.880 --> 21:27.450
Absolutely not!

21:27.560 --> 21:29.240
<i>Okay, Mrs. Hull,
we'll freeze that account.</i>

21:40.680 --> 21:42.170
What the fuck?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.283
Yeah, yeah, well,
listen, I did that.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.490
I talked to the cops, I filled out that
report, and they told me to go...

21:48.560 --> 21:51.689
No, they said because it's under
$10,000, I have to deal with you guys.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.525
And now you're sending me back to
them and they're gonna say...

21:55.760 --> 21:57.967
All right, so,
if you're gonna investigate this,

21:58.040 --> 22:00.964
how am I gonna pay for shit
in the meantime? You...

22:01.040 --> 22:05.011
You guys have my money.
That's it. That's it. That's all I have.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.323
Yes, because my
automatic payments are bouncing right now.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.447
<i>In about a month.</i>

22:08.520 --> 22:10.727
Well, I can't wait a month
for an investigation.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.564
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.324
Thank you very much.
I'll call you later.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.201
These people are
fucking useless.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.449
What the fuck happened?

22:31.240 --> 22:33.811
Dude, dude. There he is.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.486
Dude, send him a message.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.846
All right.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.241
What?

22:42.480 --> 22:44.721
Mom said
you were driving me home from school.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.764
No, Tracy drove me today.
Take the bus.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.085
I have my guitar.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.765
That's not getting in my car.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.885
I'm sorry.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.290
He really is a tool, man.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.930
I told him Jessica's mom died.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.682
I think he really feels
fucking sorry for her now.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.205
You told him
that your mom died?

23:05.360 --> 23:06.771
No, Jessica's mom died.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.685
Are you kidding me?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.240
Yeah, dude.
You gotta create empathy.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.447
A whole back story.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.681
It's weird, man.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.091
Your mom died. Yes?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.920
Yeah, dude, whatever,
just creating a story.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.121
Okay. All right,
we have lift off.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.881
You ready? I said,
"What are you up to?"

23:20.920 --> 23:22.365
He says,
"Having lunch with friends."

23:24.680 --> 23:26.967
What a lying
sack of shit, dude. Let me see.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.721
- This is fucking awesome.
- Okay.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.449
"Hey, Ben, are you horny?"

23:33.880 --> 23:38.647
"I always get horny
in the lunch room."

23:39.720 --> 23:43.042
"Makes me wanna
send you a picture."

23:43.240 --> 23:45.004
- "A picture"?
- "A pic."

23:45.120 --> 23:47.771
- He trusts us, we need to step it up a bit.
- That's true.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.845
Which pic would
you call a Jessica?

23:50.920 --> 23:53.002
Oh, my... Mama!

23:54.120 --> 23:55.565
This one? This one?
I'll do this.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.766
- Yes.
- Send.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.481
You sent it?

23:58.800 --> 23:59.881
I sent it.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.685
Here we go.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.651
Dude, I think he just
pissed his pants, man!

24:17.120 --> 24:21.523
"How about
you send me one back?"

24:36.400 --> 24:37.890
You are amazing.
That was amazing.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.289
- Peter?
- Yeah?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.401
I'm gonna ask you something
and you're going to say yes.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.524
What? What?

24:53.040 --> 24:54.724
Is that what this is about?

25:12.280 --> 25:13.406
Nice.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.164
- Yo.
- Hi.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.568
Hi. You Nina?

25:27.040 --> 25:30.328
- So, do you want to sit?
- Yeah, sure.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.085
How's it going?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.921
- Good. Yeah, good.
- Yeah? Good.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.040
Well, anyway thanks
for coming to meet me.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.923
Yeah, of course.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.241
Um...

25:46.440 --> 25:49.922
Let's do this. I know a place
right up the strip here, if you wanna go.

25:50.600 --> 25:54.446
Listen, Kyle, there's something that
I didn't tell you about myself.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.045
What, are you a dude?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.524
No. No. Wait, hang on.
Do I look like I could be a dude?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.242
- No. No.
- Good.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.490
No, I'm just...

26:06.800 --> 26:09.326
I just think your story
is really interesting,

26:09.400 --> 26:11.971
and I was wondering,
I don't know,

26:12.080 --> 26:14.606
if you would let me
interview you.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.361
What, for like a book?

26:16.440 --> 26:19.444
Well, I work for
a small TV station, a news station.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.884
And I'm a reporter.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.528
- The news? You wanna interview me on TV?
- Yeah.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.728
- Smoke? You have a smoke?
- No.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.481
- Not right now, bro. Okay.
- Because you have a really great story.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.967
You have a really great...
It's a really unique,

26:34.120 --> 26:36.566
interesting story,
and I'd love to report it.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.441
Um...

26:38.520 --> 26:42.570
- it's special.
- Wow, I... I don't know. That's...

26:42.640 --> 26:44.563
- Why not, Kyle?
- Really?

26:47.160 --> 26:48.605
This is why you came down here.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.967
No, but you see,
nobody would recognize you

26:51.040 --> 26:53.247
because you'd be in shadow
and your voice would be distorted.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.891
- I think I'm good, you know. Thank you.
- Totally anonymous.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.371
Don't you want
something better than this?

26:57.480 --> 26:58.970
Yeah, I wanted some money.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.089
I came down here, honestly, because I
thought I was gonna get some cash.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.322
And I'm really sorry
that I lied, but I knew you wouldn't...

27:04.400 --> 27:05.640
I just want to get to know you,

27:05.680 --> 27:07.170
so here's my card.
Here's my card.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.170
Just, you just never know.
Call it.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.049
And my e-mail's
on there as well.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.531
Yo, bro, wait up.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.644
Mike Dixon, please.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.291
Hello, my name is Derek Hull,
and I was referred by a Detective Mantos.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.402
Well, I'm calling
regarding a fraud case.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.531
I'll just call again.
I'll call again.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.568
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.721
- Derek? Mike Dixon.
- Yeah, Derek. Derek Hull.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.730
My pleasure. Thank you for coming so early.
I really appreciate it.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.361
How about social
networking sites, you visit those?

27:45.440 --> 27:46.805
Chat rooms, message boards?

27:46.880 --> 27:50.009
No. No. Well,
she spends her life online, but I don't.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.811
- I sell my artwork online.
- Thank you.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.882
It's sort of my business.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.322
Well, I go on
a chat site, sometimes.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.643
What kind of chat rooms?

28:02.720 --> 28:05.644
It's a...
It's a support group website.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.250
Well, here's the thing,
someone out there has all your information.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.171
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.004
I am gonna clone
your hard drives,

28:17.240 --> 28:20.369
and I'm gonna go through all the
information and the activity

28:20.440 --> 28:23.091
and see if I can figure out
how and when this happened.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.891
Is this really necessary?

28:24.960 --> 28:28.009
Can't you just take the credit card
numbers and run that somehow?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.445
No. This is very necessary.

28:29.560 --> 28:30.607
Because right now
they could have

28:30.680 --> 28:32.364
credit cards in your name,
take loans out.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.851
They could have
your social security number.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.605
They could commit crimes
in your name. Do you understand?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.523
They can sell
this information to 20 more people.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.921
This, this could
just be the beginning.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.411
It's amazing
how clueless people are.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.329
It's like picking
your nose in the car

28:53.400 --> 28:55.687
and you think
nobody's watching you.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.089
And then they wonder
how in the world

28:59.160 --> 29:01.447
someone got their
social security number.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.730
- You done with this?
- Yeah.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.329
- Hey, Dad?
- What, babe?

29:10.480 --> 29:14.166
You think maybe...
Maybe I could get an iPad?

29:14.480 --> 29:16.840
My teacher said it would,
like, help with all my schoolwork.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.847
Really? I told you
I fixed the screen

29:20.960 --> 29:23.247
on your laptop.
It's up in my office.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.324
You don't need an iPad, bud.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.003
What's this thing with you rolling your
eyes every time I say something?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.164
Wrap that up good.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.962
Way to go, butterfingers.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.448
No chicken salad for lunch.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.924
And clean the floor.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.566
And don't use the dish rag.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.961
Yeah, so I got that same guy.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.924
Keeps coming back on
with the lights turned off.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.641
I can just see, like,
the shadow from his face on the thing.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.690
It's, like, come on,
creeps me out. It's fucked up.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.444
That's fucked up.
What's up, Kyle?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.646
Harvey, this is Shane.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.841
What's up, man?

30:15.920 --> 30:17.729
He's that kid I met
at the skate park.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.245
You hungry, Shane?

30:20.720 --> 30:22.051
Dig in.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.680
He makes really
good fucking spaghetti.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.451
- Dig in.
- It's my thing, spaghetti. I make spaghetti.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.721
So, where you from?

30:28.840 --> 30:29.921
Des Moines.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.490
Yeah, you been on the streets?

30:31.640 --> 30:33.130
Let the kid eat.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.769
You know what
we do here, Shane?

30:40.720 --> 30:42.210
How old are you?

30:42.400 --> 30:43.890
Um, 15.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.489
Let me ask you a question.
Do you jerk off?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.722
Yeah? You wanna
get paid for it?

30:56.320 --> 30:58.368
- That would be fucking awesome.
- Good, man.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.770
One rule, Shane.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.723
Trust me,
no one else. Okay?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.000
So, what am I supposed to do?

31:11.080 --> 31:12.320
Take off your pants.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.882
Just look cute.
They're dying for you to take it all off.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.201
Now, play with
the toys over there.

31:18.280 --> 31:22.080
Guys talk to you all at once
and your goal is to get them to go private.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.642
And how long does
it take for someone to be interested?

31:25.720 --> 31:28.769
Look, he's already got 14
that want to go private.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.721
Look, this freak
wants to go C2C.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.684
C2C is kinda gross
'cause you have to look right at them.

31:37.760 --> 31:42.288
But cam to cam costs more
so if they wanna do it, you gotta do it.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.771
Okay. All right.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.724
Who is this guy?

31:49.240 --> 31:50.969
MumboJumbo27.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.969
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel good.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.128
You just gotta do it.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.241
One nil! Big fuck you!

33:01.200 --> 33:04.409
Fuck you.
Pick new teams.

33:04.480 --> 33:09.168
All right. Let's do it again.
I'll beat you anyway, so...

33:14.000 --> 33:16.526
- Dude. Holy shit.
- What?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.446
- Oh, my God!
- He sent it.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.210
I didn't think
he'd fucking do it.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.089
He did it! He's butt naked!

33:24.160 --> 33:27.403
- Oh, my God! What the fuck!
- He actually sent it.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.447
He fucking wrote "love slave"
on his leg with lipstick!

33:31.600 --> 33:32.840
Oh, my God.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.445
That is fucking disgusting.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.480
That's awesome.
It looks like a pink sausage!

33:38.200 --> 33:39.565
This is so...

33:41.960 --> 33:44.406
What, do you feel
sorry for him?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.529
- No.
- Are you in love with him?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.361
No, Frye.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.641
Are you in wuv with him?

33:49.720 --> 33:52.200
- Dude, stop.
- Are you in wuv with little Ben Boyd?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.322
Gross, man!
I can feel your boner!

34:01.400 --> 34:04.244
Okay, what I'd like
to tell people at this point is that...

34:04.760 --> 34:06.489
I am not a marriage counselor.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.210
I don't know what you two
know about each other, and that's okay.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.841
I don't wanna know.
That being said, here's your CD

34:12.920 --> 34:16.242
and a printed overview
of all suspicious activity.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.607
Now, I think some
of your personal information

34:18.679 --> 34:23.766
may have been retrieved with your
communications with fear&loathing.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.040
What?

34:27.159 --> 34:28.366
Who's fear&loathing?

34:29.480 --> 34:32.165
It's just some guy.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.688
He's in the chat room I go to.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.406
All you would have
had to do was click on a link

34:37.840 --> 34:39.922
or open an attachment from
him, and then he would've...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.561
He would've installed
a Trojan virus onto your system.

34:43.639 --> 34:47.326
Now, once he does this, he can do
anything he wants with your computer.

34:47.400 --> 34:51.324
You log on, you punch in your
passwords, it comes up on his screen.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.960
Everything you do, he can see.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.927
He can turn on your camera.
He can watch you.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.880
Who is fear&loathing?
Who's he?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.928
How does he have my password?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.887
Your password is your birthday.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.641
And, Derek, gambling websites
are hacked all the time.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.325
And you're also
corresponding with

35:12.440 --> 35:14.010
the bank regarding
your second mortgage.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.527
Wait, we don't have
a second mortgage.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.571
Yeah.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.401
And you received an e-mail
requesting additional information.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.927
Now, banks would never ask for sensitive
information like that via email.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.844
So, I think that's how he possibly got
your personal account numbers,

35:27.920 --> 35:31.891
your social, your mother's maiden
name and all that other stuff.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.808
Who is this guy?
What's his name?

35:35.960 --> 35:38.531
The name I came up with
is Stephen Schumacher.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.444
He's from Oakdale, PA.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.602
- He told me his name was Finn.
- Yeah.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.764
What I need to do now
is find proof. And then once I do that,

35:45.840 --> 35:48.127
I need to contact the local PD in
Oakdale and bring them into it.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.326
What kind of proof?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.970
Bank receipts,
credit card statements.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.281
If he makes any
large transaction, it could nail him.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.044
All right.
And how long will that take?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.929
Could take three weeks.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.128
Could take three months.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.322
We don't have three months.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.404
The cops couldn't do
shit for us, that's why we hired you.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.682
I understand that,
but it's just not that easy, Derek.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.240
- You have to be patient.
- I'm patient. My bank's not patient.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.845
I understand that,
but these people

36:11.960 --> 36:13.485
use mail drops,
they use PO boxes.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.450
They open an account one day,
they close it the next.

36:17.760 --> 36:21.526
Well, if you'll
excuse me, I gotta get back to work.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.887
Don't want to lose my job, too.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.521
I'm sorry you had
to see all this.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.047
No, no, no.
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.363
I'm sorry to say
that I'm used to it.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.966
Take that.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.889
You been doing this long?

36:45.960 --> 36:49.487
Privately, like 6 years.
I was a cop for 20 years.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.250
Computer crimes unit.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.608
My wife passed away,
so I retired

36:53.720 --> 36:55.768
to spend some more
time with my kid. So.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.851
I'm sorry.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.570
It's gonna be okay.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.088
It's gonna be okay,
I promise you.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.649
It's in there.
He's gonna see everything in there.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.608
I didn't, wasn't
really doing... I just...

37:55.320 --> 37:57.004
You're just
going to look at me.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.446
Okay.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.885
You're gonna change
my voice for this, right?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.007
Yeah.

38:01.160 --> 38:04.562
My mom's boyfriend was a drunk.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.480
Rager with a wicked left hook.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.649
So, how did you end up here?

38:09.720 --> 38:11.882
I met this guy at the mall.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.041
He told me he could help me out,
give me a place to stay.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.562
And then I got there and there were other
kids. it was just kind of chill.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.882
He's really not a bad guy.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.128
So, how does it work
in the house?

38:23.640 --> 38:26.405
You know, some people
have built-in cameras on their laptops,

38:26.480 --> 38:28.448
some have just webcams.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.931
All of our stuff
is kinda streamed

38:30.040 --> 38:31.530
through a site
that hosts everything.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.921
And then they kinda,
like, take out a commission, I guess,

38:34.040 --> 38:36.964
then just send us our checks.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.050
I don't know, I mean, the younger you
look, then the more you make.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.044
And what happens
when you outgrow it?

38:43.120 --> 38:47.569
When you get older and you're too
old to bring in enough customers?

38:48.520 --> 38:49.521
Um...

38:49.600 --> 38:52.490
Do you think that
you'll do this forever?

38:52.600 --> 38:54.921
I don't know.
I haven't really...

38:56.320 --> 38:58.322
I haven't really
thought about that.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.451
That's the guy!

40:18.080 --> 40:19.605
Love slave!

40:21.120 --> 40:23.885
Love slave! Love slave!

40:48.000 --> 40:49.126
Ben?

40:52.720 --> 40:53.767
Hey.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.366
You're home so early.
Is everything all right?

40:57.600 --> 40:58.681
Yeah.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.605
No band?

41:02.480 --> 41:03.811
Canceled.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.044
What are you doing?

41:12.160 --> 41:13.491
Homework.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.850
You okay, sweetie?

41:15.920 --> 41:18.366
Yeah. I have a lot
of stuff to do.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.651
All right.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.041
Okay.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.044
Why didn't you tell me money was
so tight with the second mortgage?

41:45.880 --> 41:47.120
You know you'll
have to pick me up

41:47.200 --> 41:48.480
and drop me off
every day, right?

41:49.400 --> 41:50.606
I know.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.046
I read it.
The whole thing.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.643
You told him
everything about us.

42:07.720 --> 42:10.041
I don't know what
you want from me.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.206
You barely even
look at me anymore.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.568
What time's your bus?

42:28.280 --> 42:29.805
Kyle.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.047
People are going to
smell it and come up.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.964
No, we're gonna be fine.
Just loosen up. Here.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.281
No!

42:38.400 --> 42:39.481
Come on. One.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.404
I did that whole
interview for you.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.768
And so now I have to
repay you by getting stoned?

42:46.440 --> 42:47.851
Just one hit.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.966
One. I've not smoked
since 11th grade, so...

42:53.920 --> 42:55.524
Just remember that.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.285
I bet you were
a real bad girl back in high school, huh?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.723
Nobody liked me in high school.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.131
Surprising.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.769
- Wow.

43:05.840 --> 43:10.323
Oh, my God! I thought
I shut this off, Kyle.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.561
That's loud.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.210
Kyle, would you
fucking help me?

43:13.280 --> 43:17.649
- Yeah, it's loud. Get a towel! Get a towel!
- Okay.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.564
My God, they're gonna come in!
For God sakes!

43:20.640 --> 43:22.165
Here.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.086
- You could've just done that five minutes ago.
- Ow!

43:26.160 --> 43:29.130
Oh, my God. You really
like bossing people around, don't you?

43:39.160 --> 43:40.605
Let's play truth or dare.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.171
Absolutely not.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.560
Okay, great.

43:43.680 --> 43:47.890
So, have you ever
cried over a pet?

43:54.480 --> 43:55.970
Yes.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.605
Who was it?

43:57.680 --> 43:59.682
- Snowy.
- Snowy?

43:59.760 --> 44:03.446
Not an imaginative name,
I know, but she was a white rabbit.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.249
She was very dear to me.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.881
Did you do tricks with it?
Was it a magic rabbit?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.446
How do you do tricks
with a rabbit?

44:18.960 --> 44:20.086
Wow.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.409
How do you do that in there?

44:23.800 --> 44:25.802
- Give it a shot.
- I wanna try.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.929
You just slow...
You don't force the smoke out.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.403
Nothing's happening.
Mine's shit.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.010
You know...

44:44.040 --> 44:46.566
You're the first real
celebrity I've ever met.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.447
Okay. Next question.
Have you ever...

44:57.400 --> 45:01.564
Kissed a girl on the mouth?

45:11.720 --> 45:13.609
I'm really hungry.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.282
- It's awful.
- It's not that bad.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.601
My hair is horrible.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.926
So what? Okay, fine.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.730
Smile looks fake.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.886
Okay, then this one.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.283
Don't post that picture.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.530
Don't. I swear to God.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.204
Could you turn it down!

46:51.880 --> 46:53.689
He's gonna wake up.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.051
He's gonna...

46:57.400 --> 46:58.970
He's gonna wake up.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.885
<i>Like, a lot of
the people look young</i>

47:13.960 --> 47:15.880
<i>because that's really, like,
where the market is.</i>

47:16.520 --> 47:18.081
<i>The younger you look,

47:18.480 --> 47:20.721
<i>Google the words "live webcam"</i>

47:20.800 --> 47:24.043

47:29.520 --> 47:31.443
<i>Sam wouldn't show me

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520

47:48.040 --> 47:49.530
Way to go.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.165
Nice job.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.365
Kyle?

47:56.840 --> 47:58.444
You were great.
You couldn't tell it was you, right?

47:58.560 --> 47:59.561
I kept my promise.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.486
Listen, I'm gonna
go out for a drink with some people here.

48:02.840 --> 48:04.604
- So, can I call you back later?
- Nice work.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.282
I wish you were here
to celebrate.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.482
You got that by yourself?

48:15.640 --> 48:17.369
Okay, pass it up here.

48:35.080 --> 48:36.445
Shit, Derek, I'm sorry.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.802
Thanks for going
out of your way, man.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.689
Already sending guys, huh?

48:42.280 --> 48:44.442
I've been late on
those things for months.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.211
Fucking repo guys.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.006
Here's the rest of it.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.451
I appreciate it.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.689
Next time, don't open the door.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.282
They can't take anything
unless you open the door.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.760
So, when do you think
the cops are gonna question this guy?

48:57.800 --> 49:00.201
It's like I said,
these cops, they're swamped.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.010
They don't have the resources.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.527
It's like, 25,000 people
a day get their identity stolen, so...

49:06.160 --> 49:07.571
Take a ticket.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.331
And what about you?

49:10.840 --> 49:12.365
We got his name,
we got his address.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.126
Can you go take care
of this son of a bitch?

49:14.240 --> 49:15.571
Derek.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.205
I'm a detective, not a hitman.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.090
Well, I mean...

49:20.800 --> 49:22.768
I mean, question him,
of course.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.003
Like I said,
my guys at Cybercrime are tracking him.

49:26.280 --> 49:29.762
They can't do anything
without concrete proof. Concrete proof.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.923
So I'm supposed to
just sit here and watch

49:33.000 --> 49:34.126
while things go to shit?

49:35.880 --> 49:37.291
What would you do?

49:37.360 --> 49:38.441
You don't wanna know
what I would do.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.965
I would strangle
the son of a bitch.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.129
But that's not what
I'm saying for you to do.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.764
You know what,
take this payment back.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.081
- It's your money.
- Take the money. You'll give it to me later.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.446
You may need it.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.560
Thanks.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.845
I saw everything.

50:06.200 --> 50:09.363
I know about your boy,
and I'm so sorry.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.885
But you cannot let
this bullshit break you.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.841
You hear me?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.884
You stay strong, brother.

50:42.280 --> 50:46.126
Cin, no one's helping us.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.567
No one's ever gonna help us.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.727
I'm gonna find that guy myself.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.325
I'll fix this.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.565
I wanna come.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.409
Yeah, that's right.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.244
B-O-Y-D. Boyd, Rich Boyd.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.969
The school's my next call.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.647
Uh-huh. Great, thank you.
Please do, quickly.

51:36.120 --> 51:38.088
They're gonna have
a cop call me.

51:39.080 --> 51:40.081
Okay.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.851
Well, I'm still gonna go.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.126
Okay.

51:47.720 --> 51:52.487
Can I please speak to the Principal,
Headmaster's Office, please?

51:52.560 --> 51:54.244
Dude, we're gonna get caught.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.089
We used a fake e-mail, man.

51:56.320 --> 52:00.006
Dude, just give me your iPad
and I'll delete the profile.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.610
Use your phone.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.802
My dad has software
that would totally wipe it.

52:03.960 --> 52:06.042
Just let me have it.
I have to go.

52:06.120 --> 52:08.088
- Can I please have it?
- Fine, all right?

52:08.160 --> 52:10.288
- Thanks. Bye, dude.
- Don't fuck it up!

52:19.680 --> 52:23.002
You ever think about
what you're gonna do, like, when you're 20?

52:23.080 --> 52:24.570
Be famous.

52:24.680 --> 52:26.205
Yeah, for what?

52:27.560 --> 52:31.042
I don't know. Maybe I'll be on
a reality show, or something.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.284
You'll open up <i>US Weekly</i>
and I'll be there

52:34.440 --> 52:37.603
in the "Stars that
are just like us" page.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.681
Mm-hmm.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.769
You should take
a right at the exit.

52:55.160 --> 52:56.241
Okay.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.329
All right, this is McClean.
What number was it?

53:01.480 --> 53:04.211
Um, number 418.

53:07.320 --> 53:09.163
There, red one.

53:15.080 --> 53:18.448
So, we're just gonna sit here?

53:18.520 --> 53:20.921
Yeah. We just wait.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.924
And we'll watch him,
you know, come and go.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.681
Rich.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.126
Rich.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.401
I'm right here.

53:57.040 --> 54:00.283
Can we go?
Are you ready to go to the hospital?

54:00.960 --> 54:02.610
I'm gonna stay.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.125
What are you doing?

54:05.280 --> 54:08.648
I'm trying to figure out
what he could have been thinking.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.523
Well, me too.
Can you bring it?

54:17.240 --> 54:20.084
I don't want him to wake up
and we're not there.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.925
I feel like he may have
deleted a few things.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.048
I want to bring
this blanket because...

54:25.480 --> 54:27.403
I don't want him to be cold.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.282
It's so cold in there.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.126
Hey.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.406
Honey.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.849
Meet you there.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.731
Hey, Nina!

55:09.120 --> 55:11.248
- What's up?
- I got a call from CNN.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.091
Their office saw your piece,
they wanna put it in a special.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.129
You're kidding.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.004
No. Nice job.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.402
- Hey, look.
- At what?

55:34.600 --> 55:37.251
Beamer pulling in.
Very nice fucking car.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.890
Yeah.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.764
There he is.
There he is.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.045
Is that him?

55:53.440 --> 55:56.489
Yeah, just 20 years later.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.762
Did you send him pictures, too?

56:03.280 --> 56:04.691
I'm such an idiot.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.649
<i>You know what?
You need to take</i> a <i>shower.</i>

58:32.720 --> 58:34.400
We're meeting
the neurologist at 10:00 a.m.

58:35.240 --> 58:38.528
Did you know that
his favorite book was <i>White Noise?</i>

58:40.520 --> 58:41.965
No, I didn't.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.924
What?

58:52.080 --> 58:53.684
What is it, Abby?

58:57.240 --> 58:59.891
- Marnie's younger sister is in his grade...
- Oh, my God.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.769
And she said she got it.

59:02.720 --> 59:05.963
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.040
- What the hell's this?
- I don't know. I just got it.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.208
- Who sent that to you? Why do you have it?
- Marnie sent it to me.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.441
Has everybody in the school seen it?

59:13.520 --> 59:15.648
I don't know!
I'm sure everyone saw it!

59:21.320 --> 59:23.641
What do you mean, you're
chatting with the dad? Are you insane?

59:23.800 --> 59:26.406
Dude, I'm dealing.
It's just not that simple.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.562
Why are you talking to him?
Just, hey.

59:28.640 --> 59:31.041
Delete the fucking account
and give me back the iPad.

59:31.120 --> 59:34.124
Dude, if I ignore him...

59:36.320 --> 59:40.689
If I ignore him
or I delete Jess's account right away...

59:40.840 --> 59:42.842
I mean, how would that look?

59:43.000 --> 59:44.968
She would be the only suspect.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.687
We just have to act chill and lay low.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.802
I always knew you'd outgrow us.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.371
Yeah, right.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.921
- Oh.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.371
It's me.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.606
Hey, Kyle.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.808
<i>Hey, what's up?
I think I'm here.</i>

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.245
Here where?

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.209
I think I'm downstairs.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.089
Downstairs?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.925
<i>I came to celebrate. We're
celebrating, right?</i>

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.566
Um...

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.043
Yeah. Sure.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.200
- ...he would trust me.
- Did you give him your address?

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.367
I had to, Peter.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.204
- What are you doing?
- How else...

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.805
I had to make him trust me.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.250
Hey. What's up?

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.771
Kyle, this is Peter.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.809
Hey, Peter, how's it going, man?

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.325
Wow, this is an amazing view!

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.124
You're okay with this?

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.969
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.246
It's fine.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.526
We're fine, buddy.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.603
You can take a hike.
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.644
Nina, you call me if you need me.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.768
Of course. All right.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.048
- Hey...
- All right. Bye. Go.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.845
It's not bad.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.648
Peter seems like a lot of fun.
Do you read all these books?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.086
These all yours?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.566
Not all of them.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.090
So, how did you get here?

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.846
I caught a bus.
It's crazy, right?

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.407
This is a...
It's a beautiful bedroom.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.925
It's very nice.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.371
Well, I like it.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.801
It's firm.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.081
The couch is firm, also.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.524
You know, I've been...

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.330
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said...

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.205
About the future
and everything.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.166
Yeah?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.966
Yeah.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.321
Well, do you think
you might wanna leave Harvey?

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.771
Kinda, yeah.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.128
Yeah, but I don't have
anywhere else to go.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.680
Sure you do.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.165
Like where?

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.445
I don't know. You can walk
into a youth center or a church...

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.446
Church?
Yeah, that's a really great fucking idea.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.967
Go to a church. I hear
it's a perfect place for young dudes to go.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.088
Kyle, it's late,
I'm just spitballing.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.685
It doesn't have to be a church.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.003
Fuck it. I should go to MickeyD's.
I could be someone's bitch.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.526
Make some fucking burgers,
pack some groceries.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.120
A really excellent idea,
you got there.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.571
Whoa.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.041
What is this?
What the hell is this thing?

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.091
That, I will have you know,
is an award that I received

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.205
- for reporting on an annual charity drive.
- Wait.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.602
- Do your voice.
- What voice?

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.526
Your reporter voice. Come on, let's hear it.
Where you get really serious.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.126
Come on, I rode a bus for,
like, four hours, and it was really smelly.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.361
- All right.
- I wanna hear the voice.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.566
I'll show you the walk-and-talk.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.086
Walk-and-talk,
that sounds very official.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.522
Well, John,
I'm here outside of downtown

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.530
where, earlier today,
a swarm of Africanized bees

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.642
terrorized the community.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.808
And then, John...

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.648
Officials say that one of the reporters
had this massive, crazy urge

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.804
to have some awesomely amazing sex.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.249
And later on, it was reported
that that was actually total crap.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.809
- Tickle? A little?
- Slightly.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.769
- Ticklish? Are we ticklish?
- No! I'm not!

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.729
I can see that.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.481
Um...

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.287
I have to be up really early.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.408
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.485
I'm gonna put this back.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.480
Pays someone to do his laundry.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.081
- Must be nice.
- Yeah.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.923
He works there?

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.605
Wait here.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.364
What are you doing?
Be careful!

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.807
- Hi.
- Hey, I lost my ticket.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.450
Last name?

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.405
McNeil.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.089
It's not in the system.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.444
It's a blue polo.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.010
No, it's not here.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.766
You sure?

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.201
Yeah.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.765
That's weird.
What do you think happened to it?

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.364
Think it got stolen?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.604
Something like that?
You ever get robbed?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.011
I'm just asking.
I used to work retail,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.885
so I know that that
happens sometimes.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.126
I would always keep a gun
under the counter, when I worked retail.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.202
Do you do that?
Do you have a gun here?

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.446
Do I know you?

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.086
No.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.090
I'm just making chit-chat.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.486
Next?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.042
- Sorry.
- Just two items?

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.690
What's your name?

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.648
Where's Dad?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.405
Who knows.
I haven't seen him all day.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.681
Don't leave me alone with them.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.768
- Hey, Jana.
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.286
<i>It's Kendall Media,
they need you.</i>

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.166
<i>Something at
one of their stations.</i>

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.727
Not now.
Tell them to get somebody else, please.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.961
<i>They asked for you.</i>

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.363
What's this about? Why?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.803
<i>The FBI just showed up
at one of their stations.</i>

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.011
All right.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.921
We need you
to give up the kid's address.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.928
I'm not exactly sure
of what you want me to say

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.207
because I can't give
you that information.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:18.810
I'm pretty sure
that you know that.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.410
Sources are protected.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:24.041
I understand that, but a
serious crime has been committed here.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.649
These kids are victims.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.361
They are coerced, seduced.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.446
Some of them are 14,
15 years old.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.571
And NCMEC flagged
this site a year ago

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.411
and the host server's offshore.
Untouchable.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.082
So, of course,
when we saw your piece on CNN,

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.680
it's an opening, we have to go for it.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.367
But, you see, I can't betray
his trust like that. I can't.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.689
Besides, I don't even
know where he lives. I don't know.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.363
I don't have a cell phone number.
He uses prepaid cell phones.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:55.209
- He's not stupid.
- How did you find him?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.805
Well, I was looking into a story
on teen runaways,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.970
and if you Google that,
you get some weird stuff.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.644
So you befriended him.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.363
Did you pay to talk to him?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.331
Or buy him anything?
Give him money?

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:12.408
News organizations
don't pay their sources.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.928
- Is that true, Ms. Dunham?
- Of course that's true.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.082
There's just these charges
on your PayPal account.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.005
The initial payments are

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.082
having access, private access,
to talking with the boy.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:34.169
And the additions are
an option the client has to encourage

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.086
the youth to spend
more time talking to them.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:40.685
Okay.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.086
So, by way of gifting them...

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.810
- "Gifting"?
- So you gave him gifts.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.371
These weren't personal gifts.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.810
No, no, I understand.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.167
Why don't we go
have a talk in the other room?

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.084
No, I can explain myself to her.
It's not a problem.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.607
I just wanna know
what the relationship is with the boy.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.091
Come on. Now, in my office.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.491
I want to understand.
Were you intimate with him?

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.766
Did you have sex with him?

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.242
- Don't answer that.
- Nina.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.210
Absolutely not.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.446
Look, I represent
the interest of the parent company.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.847
If you want to make a First Amendment
case out of this, be my guest,

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.320
but you will need another attorney.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.563
As far as I'm concerned,
you need to give them whatever they want.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.166
I would also recommend
that you suspend her immediately.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.608
I know that I have to suspend her.
I know that, Rich.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.966
That's way too much!

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.411
This is not too much, Nina.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.281
You crossed a line.
This kid came to your fucking house!

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.802
What was I supposed to
do about that, Peter?

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.646
He showed up, okay, and I didn't want him
to feel like I had used him.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.441
Since when do you care what a source feels
like after you get what you want, huh?

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.405
Excuse me. I gotta go.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.728
- Um, how long?
- What's that?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.207
The suspension?

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.401
Well...

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.044
Until you give those two Federal Agents you
just tried to lie to the info they want.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.208
You know what this reminds of?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.963
Sitting in my Corolla,

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.528
waiting for you
outside the barracks,

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.489
wondering when you'd come out.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.006
It reminds me of sitting
outside this shithole called Al-Qa'im.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.367
Nine guys packed into an LAV.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.684
It was the start of the war,
so we were pretty buttoned up.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.007
I had to pee in water bottles.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.924
And at one point, Gunny Mullin wanted
to stitch up a couple of hadjis

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.846
'cause they kept, like,
driving back and forth in front of us,

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.322
but the call never came.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.889
You remember Mullin, right?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.885
From Lejeune?

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.761
Good guy, like, a long torso?

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.685
What is it?

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.360
It's just, you never
talk about this stuff.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.286
Right. Stay here.
Stay, stay, stay.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.249
Derek, be careful.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.721
I don't think
we should do this. This doesn't feel right.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.086
What am I looking for?

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.406
Any proof.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.925
Receipts, bank statements.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.649
- Cindy.
- What is it?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.801
Shit!

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.000
- Oh, God! We gotta get out of here.
- Go.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.969
Leave it! Let's go!

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.884
Go, go, go.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.243
Sonny boy, doing your homework?

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.645
- That's what I'm doing now.
- Yeah? Good.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.960
Where'd you get that?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.406
That's Frye's.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.802
He left it here on accident.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.450
- On accident?
- Yeah.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.204
- You're not on it?
- No.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.327
Hmm.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.970
Your computer time
is over tonight.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.280
Really?

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.962
Really? Really?

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.487
Stay off it. Put it here.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.485
Do your work.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.170
All right. I'm doing it.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.801
Don't make me be the bad guy.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.246
Hey, what's going on?

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.691
<i>Hey, thanks for
calling me back. I want...</i>

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.922
Hold on one second.
I'm just running out of the house.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.766
<i>So, have you given any thought
to what we talked about the other day?</i>

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.410
What about? Like the future?

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.682
<i>Yeah... I meant what I said.
I wanna help you.</i>

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.447
Maybe, you know,
go to school or...

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.968
<i>I'd like to help you get on your feet.</i>

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.565
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:28.008
And I know you think that
Harvey's a decent guy, and I understand,

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.404
<i>'cause he took care of you.
But here's the thing,</i>

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.930
he's using you to recruit minors.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.322
<i>And that's a felony.</i>

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.442
Really? It's a felony?

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.125
<i>Yeah. Recruiting minors
could get you serious jail time.</i>

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.126
So, what do you want me to do?

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.450
<i>- You wanna get me outta here?</i>
- Yeah.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.403
Just say the word
and I'll come and get you.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.441
<i>I can come get you now,
if you want.</i>

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.124
You want my address?

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.965
<i>How else are you gonna
move all of your stuff?</i>

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.691
<i>All that shit that
everybody buys you.</i>

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.569
Um, look, can I think about it?

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.484
Yeah, just call me.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.530
- Okay, bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.085
You are, yes. No, you're the
same detective I spoke to, sir.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.530
Yes, I'll hold.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.686
No, no, no. You don't have
somebody from Legal call me.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.730
I am a lawyer, okay?
I'll subpoena you. Do you understand me?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.565
Now, this is your website,
you work with me.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.411
The profile name
is Jessica Rhony.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.521
What's happening?

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.441
Hey.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.649
<i>We'll have someone
get in touch with you.</i>

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.728
Yeah, as soon as you can.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.811
Rich.
What are you doing?

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.050
Hang on. R-H-O-N-Y.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.761
What?

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.408
"Horny." Hang on a second,
is this a fucking anagram?

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.723
- Is this a fucking joke?
- You know what?

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.962
You need to pull it together.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.600
I don't even know
what that means, Lydia.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.603
Let the cops do their job.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.410
- And you can do yours.
- They can do theirs.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.801
What are you talking about?
I'm his father. I'm looking for answers.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.928
- Don't you give a shit what's going on?
- No, no, no.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.480
Don't you tell me how to handle this.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.971
You don't get to tell
me how to handle this.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.809
Then don't tell me how to handle it.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.641
Ben is down there and you're in here.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:44.326
Right. Doing my job.
You're down there doing your job.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.290
You're stroking his hair,
you're whispering to him. That's great!

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.081
I can't do that. I'm doing this.
This girl might not exist.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.810
What, so you have someone to blame?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.564
And then, is he gonna wake up?

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.009
<i>He just lies there.</i>

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.525
<i>And every once in
a while something moves,</i>

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.841
but they say it's just an impulse.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.001
My parents are totally imploding.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.888
What do the doctors say?

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.126
Oh, my God!
He invited me to Danny's.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.450
- Oh!
- What should I say?

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.443
- What are you gonna say? "Yes"?
- I don't know.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.521
Say yes.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.641
But I don't know.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.721
What?

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.969
I got a bank account statement.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.041
Yeah?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.371
Yeah. Looks like we got a check here
for $4,700, and another one for $3,950.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.326
Okay. Does it say what it's for?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.370
He's probably paying off his mortgage
on our dime.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.125
Look at this.
Look at this.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.364
Pay-Per-View charge.
Adult entertainment, $59.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.442
- In one month?
- In one month.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.249
I knew he was a creep.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.129
What do you think it's for?

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.611
<i>Children of the Cornhole?</i>

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.326
<i>Sperms of Endearment.</i>

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.523
I'm gonna confront this guy, Cindy.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.721
When he's least expecting it,
I'm gonna go to his house. I'll walk up,

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.088
I'll knock on the door,
and I'm just gonna say,

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.084
"What's up? What's going on?
Have you seen our money?"

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.447
"We kind of miss our money."

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.241
I'll just talk to him a bit, man to man.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.403
I mean, you never know
what he could be like.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.802
I'll be fine.
And if something goes wrong,

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.242
I brought my M9.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.969
You brought your gun?

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.929
It's not gonna get to that.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.686
I'm just gonna scare him a little.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.803
People like this,
they need to be scared sometimes.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.925
And that's my job.
I'm gonna scare him.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.608
Hey. How you doing?

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.647
Sorry.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.051
You know Ben?

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.486
Yeah, from school.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.568
Really nice of you to come.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.042
What's your name? I'm Rich.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.327
- Mike.
- How you doing?

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.361
Come on in. You guys close?

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.727
You know, Mike,
let me ask you question?

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.209
He ever mention anybody named Jessica?

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.567
- Jessica?
- Yeah. He ever talk about her?

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.449
No.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.328
Come on in. Grab a chair.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.971
I actually gotta get going.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.881
No, no, stay. I mean,
not because of me. Just stay.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.131
Maybe I can buy you a soda or something.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.842
Let me buy you a soda.
I want a coffee.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.490
Good coffee upstairs.
Come on.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.250
Okay.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.164
He goes to the gym?
Really?

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.040
Well, we were there,
but we were just kind of messing around.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.524
Sounds more like it.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.570
What else? Anything?
What's he do for fun?

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.961
- For fun?
- Yeah.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.766
You guys ever do anything crazy?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.925
I mean, we blow stuff up sometimes.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.609
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, we lit these little firecrackers,

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.684
and then we'd take
all our little army parachute figures,

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.080
and we'd go to a building
and then threw it out the window.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.806
And it would blow up while it was
still floating down to the bottom.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.485
It was crazy.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.127
I should go. My dad kind of
gets mad when I'm late, so...

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.006
Okay.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.761
Thanks.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.080
You come by any time you want.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.049
- All right?
- Okay.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.649
You guys said you'd protect him
if I gave you his address.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.121
<i>Yeah, I promise you.
This is for his own good.</i>

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.770
<i>I can't have
anything happen to him.</i>

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.171
Don't worry,
we do this every day.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.611
Social Services will be on hand.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.330
<i>When are you gonna go in?</i>

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.090
It's a few days or a week for a warrant.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.404
What? A week?
Are you sure that this is the best idea?

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.444
Trust me. Listen. Listen.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.126
What you've done is a really good thing,
Ms. Dunham.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.089
- Right.
<i>- You did good.</i>

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.970
Right. Well, thank you.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.924
Work it, God.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.927
Just hurry up.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.081
I'm trying.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.730
These fuckers put you through hell.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.844
All right. All right. Reason...

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.802
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, man.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.043
Takes a long time.
You have to e-mail them and...

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.488
You have to give a reason.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.682
I don't feel safe online.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:17.841
Hey, boys.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.927
Oh, hey.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.766
We were just looking for a power cord
for Frye's iPad.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.046
I gotta charge it.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.446
Top right drawer.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.361
- Got it. Thanks.
- Got it?

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.930
Hey, fellas!

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.284
You guys wanna tell me
what you were doing up in my office?

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.881
Told you, we were just
getting a power cord.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.362
Right, you were looking for a power cord
for his iPad.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.724
Frye, let me ask you a question.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.801
'Cause you're a smart kid, right?

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.881
Yeah.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.361
Do I look as stupid to
you as I do to Jason?

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.441
No, sir.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.885
Look close.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.727
- No. You don't.
- No?

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.929
Frye, you wanna tell me what
you were doing in my office?

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.368
- It was just...
- Frye.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.244
Frye.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.004
It was supposed to be a joke.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.164
- What?
- Dude, shut up.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.720
No, you shut up. What did you say?

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.001
We were just trying to mess with him.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.241
What did you say?

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.401
It was supposed to be a joke.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.211
We didn't think he'd hurt himself.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.882
What? Wait, wait, whoa...

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.530
Who were you messing with?
Are talking about that Boyd kid?

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.806
You had something to do with that?

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.211
Did you have something to do that?

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.845
Yes.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.766
"Yes." Yes?

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.001
Yes.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.809
Oh, man.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.361
You wanna fuck with somebody, you do it
to their face, you hear me, tough guy?

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.771
Yeah, like you?

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.120
Like me?

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.123
You, go home.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.285
Go home, Frye!

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.491
Don't you touch that. Get outta here.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.769
This is bad. You are in big trouble.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.440
I'm sorry.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.766
You're sorry?

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.286
You're sorry? What are you sorry for?
'Cause I caught you?

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.725
Or you're sorry 'cause there's a father

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.485
wondering if his son is gonna wake up?

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.441
Jason, get up.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.761
Get up, get up, get up!

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.968
Go to your room. Get outta my sight.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.443
I am so happy your mother
is not with us to see any of this.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.648
I am...

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.045
I'm sorry.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.250
You're sorry?

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.650
Do you know what that father's
going through right now

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.849
'cause of what you did to his son?

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.323
Do you know what you did?
Say something! Say something!

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.643
I know that father!
He's nothing like you!

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.882
He's nothing like you!

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.571
Kyle, wake up! Wake up!

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.326
Yo, let's hurry up, dude.

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.680
What the fuck's going on?

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.451
Harvey said the house is gonna get raided.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.528
Hurry up!

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.241
Fuck!

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.361
Ken, just hold on!

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.001
Get my bags.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.481
I'm leaving this house
in five fucking seconds!

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.607
Coming.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.887
Come on, go, let's go.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.680
I don't know
what fucking happened.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.166
Just had to get the fuck outta there.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.686
Probably one of the fucking kids.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.730
I find out who it is, you can have 'em.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.165
I'll be crossing the state line

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.163
in about 20 fucking minutes
or something.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.447
I don't know. What?

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.767
Yeah, okay.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.090
Yeah.

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.083
<i>Field office.</i>

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.129
Yeah, extension 2221.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.611
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.045
<i>He just texted me
saying they're moving.</i>

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.248
We didn't do anything.
He must've tipped them off.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.362
How would he tip them off?
He didn't know.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.807
<i>You promised you'd get him out safely.</i>

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.006
Did he say where they were going?

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.321
Of course he didn't say where...

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.085
How's he supposed to know
where they're going?

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.521
Yeah, hello? Fuck!
Fucking battery.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.240
Give me your phone, Kyle.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.004
Kyle, give me your phone.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.887
- Give me your fucking phone!
- Okay.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:05.003
<i>He could be in trouble.
You've got to move in!</i>

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.445
It just doesn't work like that, honey.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.965
<i>What way does it work?</i>

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.964
<i>If you can get him to cooperate,
we can try to help him.</i>

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.846
Right, well,
thank you for your help.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.325
Fuck!

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:28.571
Get your stuff. Let's go.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.768
Hey, Harvey, can I get my phone back?

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.846
Come on.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.724
Thanks.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.883
Kyle! God almighty, there you are!

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.450
<i>- I was so worried about you.</i>
- Hey, look.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.761
Some crazy shit's going down right now.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.410
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.090
About an hour outside town.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.606
Some place called Saw Mill River Motel.

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.526
Kyle, listen to me. After my story aired,

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.726
the FBI came to see me.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.926
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.203
What are you talking about, the FBI?

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.607
- They threatened me.
<i>- Did you give them our address?</i>

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.364
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.130
I don't fucking believe this!

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.730
<i>You straight up lied to me!</i>

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.723
Kyle, listen to me.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.400
You were never even coming, were you?

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.081
Yes! Of course I was coming! I was coming.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.446
<i>You don't give a fuck about me!</i>

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.891
No, no, no, no.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.088
<i>Of course I do! I'll come get you now.</i>

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.366
Fuck that.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.681
Kyle? Kyle!

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.970
Fuck!

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.968
- So, you really wanna do this tonight?
- Yeah.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.284
You nervous?

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.010
Yeah.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.923
That's adrenaline.

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.687
It's good. Makes you feel alive.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.409
Let's just go for it, okay?

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.481
Okay.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.410
Lantos. Yeah, what's up?

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.571
Right.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.081
Abby said you went
to the hospital today.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.885
Yeah.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.003
His friend came by today. Nice kid.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.201
Who?

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.361
Mike.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.169
- Mike. Seemed like a nice guy.
- Mike?

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.050
You mean Marcus? His old friend, Marcus?

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.762
I don't know any Mike.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.323
- You don't know a Mike?
- No.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.001
What?

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.201
Damn it! I knew there was
something off about that kid!

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.808
What are you talking about?

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.363
- This Mike guy.
- What about him?

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.409
I just need a last name.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.363
Dad, what are you doing?

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.090
- Losing it.
- No, I'm not.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.004
What's going on?

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.804
Honey, I'll be there in a minute.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.245
Where's his goddamn year?

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.691
I need you to calm down.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.364
I'm gonna show you Jessica.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.130
Oh, my God.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.126
Who gives a shit about Jessica!

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.204
All you care about is making yourself
feel less guilty!

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.647
I'm the one who cut him down!

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.565
And I knew that he didn't have any friends!

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.250
It's not your fault.

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.123
- I didn't do anything!
- It's not your fault.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.087
And people made fun of him!

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.121
I got him.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.486
It's not your fault.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.880
Lydia...

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.810
It's not even Mike.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:57.808
It's not even his name.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.245
I thought, probably give him
some crazy gift or something like that.

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.641
All right,
maybe I'll consider it.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:27.920
Yeah, go look at them.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.924
You'll have to split the thing with me.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.684
We could arrange something.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.083
What the fuck are you doing here?
Are the cops here?

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.931
No! I'm alone. I came to get you.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.161
You shouldn't be here right now.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.810
I don't blame you for not believing me,

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.121
but I promise you, Kyle,
I promise I came alone.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.090
Please, just get in the car.
I can make this right.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.647
If I go inside and I
fucking get all my shit

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.327
and I pack it all up,
I need to know that I can stay with you.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.004
Let's get your stuff and we'll talk...

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.241
No, it's a yes or no.

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.080
It's a simple question,
can I stay with you?

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.640
I don't know! Why do we need...

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.960
What do you mean, you don't know?

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.088
I'm not sure. Because...

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.326
What?

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.408
Because you're so much younger than me

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.688
and I don't know whether it's a good idea.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.087
Oh.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.561
Wow.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.283
Why can't we just go
and we can talk about it on the way?

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.526
Kyle, please.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.250
If I wasn't? If I wasn't younger?

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.688
Then, would you want me there?

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.368
- Forget this.
- Forget what? Kyle!

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.081
- Kyle!

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.448
Mike, how are you?

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.241
Hey, Derek. Yeah, it's not him.

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.085
<i>It's not him. My guy, Lantos,
got Schumacher's IP address</i>

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.846
<i>and turns out he's a victim, too.</i>

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.206
What do you mean?

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.006
<i>Someone was using his computer as a proxy,
all right?</i>

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.809
I don't know, we're tracing it from Texas.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.043
Anyway, the bottom line is,
Schumacher is not your guy.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.691
Are you sure?

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.086
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.844
<i>I just got the information.</i>

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.689
Now, I don't know where you are, brother,

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.604
but you gotta stand down. You hear me?

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.682
<i>Derek?</i>

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.848
I got it. It's okay. It's all right.

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.843
<i>I gotta jump. I'll be in touch.</i>

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.646
Thank you.

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.530
What did he say?

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.165
It's not him.

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.531
It's not him.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.045
Derek, please. It's okay, babe.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:27.364
Derek, I don't care about the money.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.408
Or the house.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.484
Please, just take me home.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.890
I was a Marine, Cindy.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.924
What am I now?

01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.884
I'm a tool.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.568
Some paper-pushing grunt.

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.563
- No.
- Yeah.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.451
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, my name's Rich Boyd.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.284
Your son put my son in the hospital

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.727
and I wanna talk to him right now.
His name's Jason.

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.888
- I don't have time for...
- Sometimes he's Jessica.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.720
He's got a little bit
of an identity crisis.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.169
He harassed my son.
He's sadistic. He needs fucking help.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.685
- He needs fucking help?
- Yeah.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.330
- My son needs help?
- Yeah.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.607
Your kid tried to hang himself
and my kid needs help?

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.966
You knew? You fucking knew!

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.443
Shut the car down. Get out. Get out.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.126
Come on, get out! Step out slowly.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.520
Come on, get out!

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:09.965
I'm coming. Take it easy.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.804
You stay in the car.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.724
Stay right there.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.920
- What is this? Huh?
- What are you talking about?

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.930
You're following me. You're stalking me.
You come into my business.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.844
You break into my house.
Do you think I'm stupid or something?

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.531
Just come with me!

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.128
No, just leave me alone.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.526
Get your stuff and let's go!

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.926
What is wrong with you?

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.009
Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you!

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.243
Do you have any idea what you've done?

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.324
No. Not just to me, to all my friends,
to Harvey!

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.364
You think Harvey exploits me?

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.881
I like what I do! Do you get that?

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.724
I don't wanna be saved from this!

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.683
I turn people on, so what?

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.290
You couldn't turn a fucking light on,
you know that?

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.443
You're the one who exploits people.
You exploited me!

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.045
You...

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.604
You're the one who fucking exploits people.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.284
I'm fucking done.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.401
Okay, okay.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.443
I'm not gonna listen.
You get the fuck away from me.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.487
Let's talk about it.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.767
No, we're not gonna
fucking talk about it.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.522
- What's your plan?
- Don't move.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.680
- Shoot me in front of my wife?
- Stay right there.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.444
- The safety's on.
- Shut up!

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.607
Steven? It's Cindy Hull.

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.642
Cindy?

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.807
Derek!

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:38.691
Dad!

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.123
Dad!

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.681
You Okay?

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.847
Yeah.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.370
Okay. Okay.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.602
- Stop, stop, stop.
- You do this a lot?

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.042
You send a lot of married women
your picture?

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.521
- Can we talk here?
- Derek, stop.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.840
- How does it feel?
- It was a mistake.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:55.080
Yeah, we're gonna keep going.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.284
Have you ever had a gun
in your face before?

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.328
- I have.
- Derek, he didn't do anything.

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:01.731
He did.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.126
Don't do this.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.362
Please tell him
it was harmless, Cindy.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.883
Derek, it's not his fault. It's my fault.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.325
What are you talking about?

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.845
He talked to me...

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.129
When you wouldn't.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.807
He told me about taking
his wife to chemo...

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:25.202
And how cold her hands were,
and the meds.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.165
And I told him about...

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.966
And I told him about... Ethan.

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.325
I told him about our little baby boy.

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.484
It's okay. Please, baby.

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.324
Come on, give me the gun.

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.486
Just leave her. It's fine. Let's go.

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.125
Oh, my God!

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.526
I'm okay.

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.321
- No, you're not.
- I'll explain. Just let me...

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.610
I love you.

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.404
I love you, too.

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.244
Everything...

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.040
Everything that I love

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.770
is in this room.
