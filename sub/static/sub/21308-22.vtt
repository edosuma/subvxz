01:01.210 --> 01:03.790
Hey, Mr. Muscles,
just keep driving.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.420
Just lookin' out
for your safety.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.420
Then look out
for that cliff.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.580
Ha ha!

01:10.580 --> 01:12.750
Oh, man, I was
not payin' attention.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.790
Nice save, Nachos.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.120
- Marco!
- Sorry.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.460
So, uh, what are
we lookin' for again?

01:18.460 --> 01:19.960
Oh, uh, that thing.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.380
Follow me.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.120
Why did you
punch him in the eye?

01:29.120 --> 01:31.790
- Where else was I
supposed to punch him?
- Just don't punch it.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.620
Whoa!

01:41.620 --> 01:44.210
- Just drive, muscles.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.330
Another portal closed.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.920
Man, I missed this.

crazy adventures.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.170
Hey! Who you
callin' weird?

02:02.170 --> 02:04.330
I'm quirky.

02:04.330 --> 02:07.460
I just wish more portals would
open in your dimension, Hekapoo.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.420
I look so awesome there.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.880
Yeah, it's
a real shame.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.040
- Oh, I gotta go.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.960
Already?
We just sat down.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.710
I'll sit with ya.

02:17.710 --> 02:20.000
No, thanks, weirdo.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Nachos!

02:22.000 --> 02:24.620
Oh, buddy, it's getting
harder and harder to leave ya.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.330
Hey, muscles,
you comin' back tomorrow?

02:28.330 --> 02:29.670
Yeah, if you need me.

02:29.670 --> 02:30.880
I could use a hand.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.120
Cool. Can't wait.

02:37.710 --> 02:39.040
Marco.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.250
Hey... oh.

02:41.250 --> 02:45.080
Oh... what happened
to your face?

02:45.080 --> 02:47.790
I tried to take
Glossaryck for a walk today.

02:47.790 --> 02:49.290
It did not go well.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.620
I really could've used
some help from my squire,

02:54.620 --> 02:56.670
who was mysteriously
not around.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.960
Yeah, sorry.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.170
I was, uh...
fishing.

03:02.170 --> 03:04.960
You went fishing
in the middle of the night?

03:04.960 --> 03:07.790
- Yep.
- Well, did you
catch anything?

03:07.790 --> 03:10.120
I caught a mackerel.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.920
A big old mackerel.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.000
You caught a mackerel?
Where is it?

03:16.960 --> 03:18.380
I ate it.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.460
Okay. Well, I gotta
help my dad clear out
the castle sewers tomorrow.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.380
Fuuuuun!

03:27.380 --> 03:29.540
So could you just
keep an eye on Glossaryck?

03:29.540 --> 03:30.960
Yeah. I can do that.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.750
Oh, great.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.120
Things have been
pretty busy around here.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.460
Well, your squire
is here to help.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.750
Thanks, squire.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.670
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

03:42.670 --> 03:44.920
This is
a meow-trage, I say.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.210
Can you hurry up?

03:46.210 --> 03:49.830
I'm trying.

03:52.670 --> 03:57.500
Shiver me timbers,
we're all gonna die...

04:02.380 --> 04:05.080
Hekapoo, hey.
I'm here.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.000
Oh. Nice of you
to show up.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.670
Star needed me
to watch Glossaryck,

04:09.670 --> 04:11.460
but it's cool,
I handled it.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.960
Great story. Now can you
give me a hand with this?

04:13.960 --> 04:16.000
Oh, right.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.830
Huh?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.920
Captain, what were
those strange creatures?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.620
Angels, me boy.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.420
They be but angels.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.790
Fur-tastic.

04:33.790 --> 04:36.420
You two make
a purr-fect team.

04:36.420 --> 04:39.040
Meow-velous.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.420
Well, I hate it here.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.670
So... tavern?

04:43.670 --> 04:45.830
- Oh, no. I gotta go.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.750
Star needs me.
She says it's urgent.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.380
But the same time tomorrow?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.120
Ah, you bet.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.960
Please stop doing that.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.540
Not until you're bald.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.040
Hey, Star, what's
the emer... gency?

05:03.880 --> 05:06.080
You had one job.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.500
Sorry, I was
fishing again.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.250
Wait a minute.
Greasy pants.
Dimensional scissors.

05:12.250 --> 05:15.290
Scorched bald spot.
You haven't been
fishing at all.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.290
You've been hanging out
with Hekapoo again.

05:17.290 --> 05:21.620
Uh, uh, just for, like,
a second.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.880
Marco, I need you here.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.460
Glossaryck needs
constant surveillance.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.380
I know it's not as glamourous
as dragon cycling.

05:31.380 --> 05:33.080
I've been really
overwhelmed lately,

05:33.080 --> 05:34.790
and I need your help.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.380
You're right.

05:36.380 --> 05:37.580
No more moonlighting.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.210
Here.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.000
You can watch
these for me.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.880
Thanks, Marco.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.580
I'm at your service,
milady.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.250
Ha ha ha.
Don't ever call me that.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.580
Now get some sleep.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.710
Tomorrow, we're gonna be
waist deep in sewer sludge.

05:52.710 --> 05:55.620
Can't wait.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.460
Let's ride.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.920
Okay, this is
just for tonight.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.540
Don't look at me like that.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.120
Hey, sorry.
I'm late again.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.670
Where are we
riding today?

06:24.670 --> 06:26.330
This next job's
pretty big,

06:26.330 --> 06:28.750
so I hired Talon Raventalon
for some extra muscle.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.790
Who's Talon Raventalon?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.250
I'm Talon Raventalon!

06:32.250 --> 06:39.380
[electric guitar

06:39.380 --> 06:42.920
One glass of worms.
Extra wiggly.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.960
Hekapoo, we don't
need this bro.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.540
Actually, we kinda do.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.290
You've been so busy,
I wasn't sure you
were gonna show,

06:50.290 --> 06:51.880
and I can't do
this job alone.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.120
I guess that's fair...

06:54.120 --> 06:56.170
but him?

06:58.330 --> 06:59.920
So what's the job,
anyway?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.670
Dragon cyclers
don't ask questions.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.460
Dragon cyclers ride!

07:12.830 --> 07:15.120
So what are we
doing today?

07:15.120 --> 07:18.000
- Something fun.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.830
Like closing up
these portals for good.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.040
Wait, so... what?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.000
There's a pattern to where
these portals have been opening.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.170
And the next one should
open right over there.

07:31.170 --> 07:34.210
Whatever comes out of it,
we're takin' it down!

07:34.210 --> 07:36.170
Oh, yeah!
With this!

07:37.250 --> 07:39.330
Doesn't this seem
like overkill?

07:39.330 --> 07:41.170
Talon likes
overkill.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.920
[electric guitar
riff plays]

07:42.920 --> 07:45.920
H

07:45.920 --> 07:48.420
So it's just that
closing these portals
with you

07:48.420 --> 07:50.750
has been the highlight
of my time on Mewni.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.500
Do we really
have to stop?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.540
Marco, this has been fun,

07:54.540 --> 07:56.210
but I've got a job to do.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.920
Yeah, just
don't do it.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.380
My job is to stop whatever
comes out of that portal.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.670
Incoming!

08:04.920 --> 08:06.210
There it is!

08:06.210 --> 08:08.120
Oh, yeah!

08:08.120 --> 08:09.670
Stop!

08:11.250 --> 08:13.080
Marco, what are you doing?

08:13.080 --> 08:15.880
I'm not sure,
but you need to stop.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.290
Oh, I'm just gettin' started.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.120
Ba-kaw!

08:23.120 --> 08:25.210
Marco, it's my job.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.290
Star?

08:33.210 --> 08:34.670
Oh, I love harpoons.

08:34.670 --> 08:36.330
No! You idiot!

08:37.380 --> 08:39.040
Ha ha!

08:49.670 --> 08:50.710
Star!

08:58.880 --> 09:02.000
That was some great
riding, Hekapoo.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.670
You knew?

09:03.670 --> 09:06.380
You knew that Star
was the one opening
these portals,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.080
and you didn't
tell me?!

09:08.080 --> 09:10.880
Okay, okay,
hear me out.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.670
I'm reporting this
to the high commission.

09:13.670 --> 09:16.540
Okay, yeah, I lied
to you about Star,

09:16.540 --> 09:18.330
but not about
anything else.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.460
Working with you
has been incredible,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.880
and I don't want it
to end.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.500
Please don't report this
to the high commission.

09:25.500 --> 09:29.000
Star needs to figure out
her new powers on her own.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.710
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

09:31.710 --> 09:34.580
I'm her squire;
I can make sure she's safe.

09:34.580 --> 09:37.210
Haven't I earned
your trust by now?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.210
No!!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.500
Pretty please, H-Poo.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.420
Oh, you know I can't
resist your adult voice.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.790
Fine. I won't report
this, for your sake,

09:47.790 --> 09:51.500
but us working
together is over.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.460
- Hekapoo.
- Here.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.500
You're gonna
need this.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.620
Star's lucky to have
a squire like you.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.620
Yah!

10:06.120 --> 10:07.460
You wanna hang out?

10:09.540 --> 10:13.380
[electric guitar

10:16.120 --> 10:18.380
Uh... hello?

10:19.540 --> 10:22.330

10:24.710 --> 10:26.710
Marco?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.920
What are you doing?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.460
And what are you doing
with your scissors?

10:31.460 --> 10:33.710
Okay, okay,
I can explain.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.040
First you're lying,
and now you're stealing.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.460
- I've been closing
your portals.

10:39.460 --> 10:43.460
Uh, you've been opening them
in different dimensions,

10:43.460 --> 10:46.540
and I've been closing them,
with Hekapoo.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.540
Wha

10:48.540 --> 10:50.670
Does Hekapoo know about...

10:50.670 --> 10:53.750
Yeah. Yeah, she knows.
She's not happy about it.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.880
Oh, no. Oh, no,
oh, no!

10:56.880 --> 10:59.420
Star, I like
adventures,

10:59.420 --> 11:01.500
but I like keeping
you safe more,

11:01.500 --> 11:04.460
so I can stop
doing this.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.790
Can you stop
doing that?
