00:06.000 --> 00:08.560
Thank you for everything.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.520
I'm sorry to have brought trouble
to your home.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.880
This house has seen worse.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.240
Be careful in Madison.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.200
Baldwin will stall the Congregation
as long as he can,

00:26.360 --> 00:29.560
although it will be no more
than a couple of days.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.680
-But this isn't his battle, it's yours.
-I know, Maman.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.880
Take care, now.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.360
-Whatever you need of me, I'm ready.
-I thank you, Maman.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.920
Shall we?

01:28.120 --> 01:30.120
Home.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.000
Madison in the fall
is the best Madison there is.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.760
There's nobody here.
I told them when we were arriving.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.560
They wanted to give us a few minutes
alone with the house.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.840
The house has been known
to misbehave with new people.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.920
-They're letting it get used to you.
-So it's haunted?

02:14.080 --> 02:16.360
We're witches.
Of course, it's haunted.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.360
Okay.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.920
What's it capable of?

02:33.920 --> 02:36.600
Slamming doors, flickering lights.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.480
One time, the whole second floor
disappeared for a week.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.760
Well, nice to see you too, Tabitha.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.080
Don't worry. It's not you
I need to interrogate.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.080
We won't be staying long.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.880
Domenico fails to retrieve her.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.280
You fail to retrieve her.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.840
And now what? Are you saying
that we've lost her altogether?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.240
You expect us to believe that?

03:05.400 --> 03:10.640
You seem extraordinarily interested
in Diana Bishop, Agatha.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.360
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

03:14.520 --> 03:17.160
My interest is in The Book Of Life.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.000
You promised that Diana
would answer our questions.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.480
And she will.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.840
Once we find Satu
and bring her and Diana home.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.800
Satu has Diana?

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
I'm afraid it looks that way.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.000
Gentlemen?

03:35.880 --> 03:41.080
Our team repeated the spell work
and got exactly the same result.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.800
There are two distinct
magical signatures.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.200
Satu's with another witch.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.480
Do we think that Diana
is an ally or a prisoner?

03:57.640 --> 03:59.760
Unclear, I'm afraid.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.200
Let us keep the search going
round the clock.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.840
I want her found.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.160
Why isn't Gerbert here?
Do you know where he is?

04:16.320 --> 04:18.440
Pay Miss Durand a visit, find out.

04:20.480 --> 04:25.200
The rest of you can go home. For now,
let us each take care of our own.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.720
I intend to.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.920
Diana!

04:42.560 --> 04:44.760
Honey! Oh, my God!

04:46.080 --> 04:48.360
Did the house lock you out?

04:49.360 --> 04:52.160
What did I say?
I said the house wouldn't like him.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.920
The house likes him fine.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
Tell me the truth.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.080
All this time, did you know
what was wrong with me?

05:01.040 --> 05:03.800
Why don't we just, erm...
just go inside?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.440
No, tell me now.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.200
What's going on?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.640
Did you know that I was spellbound?

05:11.640 --> 05:12.960
What?

05:17.640 --> 05:21.040
I, erm... I guessed
that you might be, yes.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.920
Who was it?

05:28.080 --> 05:31.400
-Diana, you have to understand...
-Who? Who was it?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.520
Rebecca and Stephen.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.600
Honey, your parents.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.560
No, Em! No, I don't believe it!

05:46.720 --> 05:51.120
-Rebecca? She would never put...
-Just tell me why!

05:52.120 --> 05:54.280
-What is wrong with me?
-Oh, sweetie.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.760
Honey, there's nothing wrong with you.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.880
No, you do not do that for no reason.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.000
Not to your child! Not to anyone.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.560
Believe me, Diana,
you did nothing wrong.

06:06.080 --> 06:10.600
Look. The Congregation would have tested
your powers when you came of age,

06:10.760 --> 06:14.400
just like with any other kid,
but Knox, he wouldn't wait.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.520
He was obsessed with the idea that
you would inherit your mum's powers.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.960
Rebecca and Stephen
didn't want him to see you.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.760
I mean, that's why they came here,
honey, to get away from him.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.240
Look. Whatever Rebecca's
reasons were, honey,

06:29.400 --> 06:32.560
she only meant to protect you.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.680
You were everything to her.
Stephen too.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.720
They loved you, Diana, they loved you.

06:39.720 --> 06:45.360
I was half myself for years
and you didn't say a thing.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.320
I had to trust that she wanted me
to keep this secret for a reason.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.800
I had to trust that what
she thought was best.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.320
And that's it?

06:59.480 --> 07:02.400
-That's all you know?
-I promise. I said I promise.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.400
Let her go.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.480
Excuse me?!

07:13.320 --> 07:14.680
What the hell?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.200
What's wrong with the house?

07:17.360 --> 07:20.160
It's... It's Peter Knox.
He's found us.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.520
The house is trying to protect us.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.560
We're out of time.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.720
Mum, why are you sad?

08:00.880 --> 08:04.400
I'm not sad, pumpkin.
I'm here for a story.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.440
Your favorite story,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
The Magic Ribbons
And The Shadow Prince.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.560
You have to stay very still if you
want to hear it, okay, sweetheart?

08:16.760 --> 08:20.080
Once upon a time,
there was a young witch...

08:21.080 --> 08:25.600
a very brave young witch who
was covered in invisible ribbons...

08:25.760 --> 08:27.400
Guardians of the elements, I call you.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.960
..in all the colors of the rainbow.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.080
Guardians of the elements...

08:32.240 --> 08:35.000
Lie down, sweetheart.
You need to stay very still, remember?

08:35.159 --> 08:37.440
Shield you from your power.
We bind you.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.320
The ribbons that wrapped around
the witch were special ribbons.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.080
..We bind you.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.880
Mum, I don't like it.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.280
Guardians of the elements, I call you.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.280
It's okay, baby.
Look at me, look at me.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.960
-Mum.
-The ribbons would protect the girl

08:53.120 --> 08:55.960
from witches who were
jealous of her power.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.680
Then one day,
when she was all grown up,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.280
-she met the Shadow Prince.
-Mum.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.480
What have we done?

09:14.880 --> 09:16.800
Our magic is who we are.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.640
She's safe, she's alive.
We had no other option.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.640
One day, if she really needs it,
she'll find it again.

09:30.560 --> 09:36.080
Mum, finish the story.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.760
He'll put his hand on your head
for a few minutes, that's all.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.440
You don't have to do anything
and it won't hurt, I promise.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.080
We'll be right out here,
sweetheart, okay?

09:57.320 --> 10:01.800
Hello, Diana. I'm Peter.
Come here.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.840
There's nothing to be afraid of.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.520
We just need to take a little look
at what's inside.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.200
-Here we go on an adventure!
-This bag is so heavy!

10:33.320 --> 10:37.400
Rebecca, you have every book
known to man in this suitcase!

10:39.360 --> 10:41.840
Come here, give me a hug.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.480
We'll be back in a couple of weeks,
okay? You be a good girl.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.160
If Peter comes back, it's us
he'll be looking for, not Diana.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.360
Look after your Aunt Sarah.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.600
Rebecca, what is going on?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.960
-Please don't ask me that.
-Okay.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.880
Ah, here we go!

11:05.880 --> 11:07.440
Yeah?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.520
Hey, sweetie, can I have my bag?
Can I have a hug?

11:18.080 --> 11:21.280
We'll be back before you know it,
pumpkin.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.520
Be good.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.200
Bye!

11:31.400 --> 11:32.760
-Bye!
-Bye!

11:32.920 --> 11:34.320
Bye!

11:40.400 --> 11:42.720
Come on!
Hot chocolate and marshmallows.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.320
Definitely.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.240
Diana.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.240
Mum.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.680
There's nothing wrong with you, Diana.
There never was.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.640
Normally, when you're spellbound...

12:45.200 --> 12:47.000
that's it.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.080
You're bound for life.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.160
Until that person sets you free.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.400
-But not you.
-No, I think they tied it to need.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.160
If I was ever in trouble, I could...

13:02.320 --> 13:04.720
still call upon my magic

13:04.880 --> 13:06.640
and I wouldn't be alone.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.720
Matthew, you were in their stories.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.320
The spell was somehow tied to me too.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.280
To my need for you.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.680
They knew I'd fall in love with you.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.440
Coffee, Sarah?

14:10.040 --> 14:12.680
You know, I thought she'd come home
and tell you herself.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.520
But then, you know...

14:16.680 --> 14:18.400
we buried them...

14:19.440 --> 14:22.800
and it just didn't seem to matter.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.520
We were only holding
ourselves together.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.320
I suspected that Diana's magic
just wasn't right.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.360
I mean, you saw it.
Honey, it came and went.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.760
And it's not like those old stories
about spellbound witches

14:39.920 --> 14:41.840
that are left with nothing.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.480
The thought of saying
those words out loud,

14:47.640 --> 14:51.000
to you, telling you that I thought

14:51.160 --> 14:53.720
Rebecca spellbound her daughter.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.040
I just didn't want to
break your heart again.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.640
She didn't trust me, Em.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.120
Oh.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.960
Darling, it wasn't like that.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.400
It was. It was and it's okay.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.640
She knew too well...

15:22.640 --> 15:25.640
She knew you'd be careful...

15:26.640 --> 15:28.520
and patient.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.160
And I'd just rant and rage and...

15:33.160 --> 15:35.960
go after Knox with a carving knife.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.480
Well, maybe you should have.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.280
Well, there's still time.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.920
Sarah, look at me, please.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.840
Please, please, please, look at me.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.680
She trusted you, she did.
Honey, she trusted you

15:54.840 --> 15:57.720
to be the carer, the warrior.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.200
To keep her safe while she was gone.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.880
And that is exactly
what you did, my love.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.720
Oh, honey, don't cry, please!

16:19.160 --> 16:20.840
Who is it?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.400
Who is there?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.480
Who is it?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.400
Who's there?

16:34.640 --> 16:37.600
You killed Rebecca Bishop
and Stephen Proctor.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.440
Where's Diana?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.320
You told me...

16:51.480 --> 16:55.160
opening someone up
would affect the spell caster too.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.360
And you knew it because
you cast a spell yourself.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.760
Twice.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.680
You opened them up to get to the power
you couldn't find in their daughter.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.400
-Am I right?
-No.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.480
Did you find what
you were looking for?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.720
That's because the power
was never theirs.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.800
-It was Diana's.
-No!

17:20.560 --> 17:22.119
-I tested her!
-Yes, you did.

17:22.280 --> 17:26.640
And you couldn't find it
because she was spellbound.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.720
She must be.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.400
Diana doesn't even know
her own power, what she is.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.680
You should have seen it, Peter.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.040
It could only have been them.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.920
They did it.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.720
The parents? Are you sure?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.520
Rebecca could have
led the Congregation.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.320
That's where she was headed.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.520
And then we could have really,
finally challenged the De Clermonts.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.680
But Stephen...

18:04.840 --> 18:07.400
I've never met a witch

18:07.560 --> 18:10.360
so secretive, so selfish.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.200
He got into her ear and that was it.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.360
Our great hope...

18:17.760 --> 18:19.080
gone.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.160
You loved her.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.040
I never intended to kill him,
if that's what you mean.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.680
You loved her.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.720
But the power you sensed...

18:30.200 --> 18:31.680
you loved that more.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.880
I wanted it too.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.400
That's why I betrayed you.

18:40.160 --> 18:44.160
That's why I had to open up Diana,
even though it drained my power.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.280
It will come back.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.480
Won't it?

18:54.640 --> 18:56.200
Give it time.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.760
And rest.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.400
Peter.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.600
There's a prophesy about
the end of the vampires.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.600
I think it has to do with Diana.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.360
Which means that creature...

19:14.600 --> 19:16.960
We need to get her away from him,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.120
whatever the cost.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.040
Curing a fever.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.240
How to fix a leaky roof.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.680
This is child's play. Where are
the spells for self-defense?

19:28.840 --> 19:30.840
For setting up a shield
around a property?

19:31.000 --> 19:35.400
That's just not possible. Those spells
haven't worked in generations. Look...

19:36.680 --> 19:38.720
I know you're worried
about Knox finding you.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.680
I'm worried about Diana's power.
She needs to learn control.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.720
Now you may think these spells are
quaint, but that's what they teach.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.920
-With respect, Sarah...
-They teach control!

19:48.080 --> 19:49.720
That witch came to kill her.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.360
When she comes back,
she will not be alone.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.800
This is not enough by a tenth
let alone by a half!

19:54.960 --> 19:57.920
I know you're trying to scare me,
but I'm already scared.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.600
And I am doing the very best
that I can.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.120
You're right, Sarah,
I do need control.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.360
I'll go back to the basics.
Start my magical training over again.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.600
And you can teach me
how to defend myself, Matthew,

20:11.760 --> 20:14.200
so I can use my magic
against our enemies.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.840
Stay away the dark.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.160
Stay away the dark.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.040
Look, you don't just
say the words, okay?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.640
You have to concentrate
on what you desire.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.880
You feel it. Set your power alight.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.040
It'll come, honey.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.680
-Try it again.
-Okay.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.520
I could have sworn this box
was from the 17th century,

20:43.680 --> 20:46.040
but for the condition.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.360
Lovely, isn't it?

20:50.520 --> 20:52.960
It was a present from Diana's father.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.520
He was a timewalker.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.960
Wow!

21:02.200 --> 21:03.520
Look at you.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.880
Stephen might have been a little bit
more discreet with his souvenirs

21:07.040 --> 21:09.640
had he known a vampire
was gonna come a-calling.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.160
Did he go to the past often?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.800
Mm, far less after Diana was born,

21:17.960 --> 21:21.360
but he would still take Rebecca
someone special for her birthday.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.640
It's that easy to do?

21:25.840 --> 21:28.080
I don't know about "easy". I mean...

21:29.120 --> 21:30.960
You know, jumping a few minutes
forward and back, that's one thing,

21:31.120 --> 21:34.160
but going further back in the past,
you know.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.080
He said he had to find
three objects from the right time.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.160
Stay away the dark.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.280
-Stay away the...
-That's it! That's it!

21:48.440 --> 21:50.680
-Once more.
-Stay away the dark.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.480
Stay away the dark!

21:56.720 --> 21:58.480
So much for my control.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.480
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.760
No air for fire, extinguish
the light of the fire.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.960
Okay.
One more time.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.440
Okay.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.480
-You need to go.
-Why? He's not here.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.600
Why do you never run?

22:29.720 --> 22:31.880
He's out of the city,
you have the keys.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.040
Is it really just the promise
of Matthew keeping you here?

22:38.040 --> 22:40.360
You don't understand me or Matthew.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.280
Gerbert does, does he?

22:47.040 --> 22:50.840
You know Baldwin's telling people
Satu has Diana.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.080
I think he's lying.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.480
-Why would he do that?
-That's a good question.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.440
You think Diana's still with Matthew.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.560
I once got my hands
on Diana's personal file.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.960
I could again if you'd like to
explore your options.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.120
Why would you do that?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.320
What's in it for you?

23:19.480 --> 23:22.760
I was born here, in Venice,
did you know that?

23:24.240 --> 23:27.320
It's the only home I know,
so I keep Baldwin happy.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.440
Or Gerbert, or whoever's pulling
the strings that day, but you...

23:33.960 --> 23:35.800
you could go anywhere.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.680
I...

23:42.400 --> 23:44.200
don't remember my home.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.280
When did you last see Matthew?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.800
It's been decades, hasn't it?

23:54.840 --> 23:57.200
Gerbert doesn't control you.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.120
He does.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.280
I'll get you the file.
The way I see it,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.600
you either go after Matthew
or you burn it,

24:07.760 --> 24:10.240
prove I'm wrong,
walk away from all this.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.680
Either way...

24:15.200 --> 24:16.680
you'd be free.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.760
Diana, this one's easy. Trust me!

24:34.920 --> 24:38.080
Easy for you, easy for Em, not for me!

24:38.240 --> 24:39.800
Look...

24:39.960 --> 24:42.280
we're both just too worked up.
We just...

24:42.440 --> 24:45.520
Your magic works differently
from my magic, Sarah.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.480
You can't help me with this.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.400
We'll take a break, I think.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.600
-Oh, come on! I'm sorry.
-No. No!

24:58.040 --> 24:59.360
What?

25:00.440 --> 25:02.080
Diana?

25:04.360 --> 25:05.880
Diana?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.240
What if it was Satu?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.280
-We don't know how powerful she is.
-Quiet.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.800
I can hear her.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.120
She's all right.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.280
What just happened?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.760
I don't know. I...

25:37.960 --> 25:40.800
I needed to step outside to get
some air and then, bam, I was...

25:40.960 --> 25:42.320
here.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.320
Do you think that you might
have just timewalked?

25:49.960 --> 25:51.560
I mean it, I mean it.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.520
You weren't there.
You certainly weren't here.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.880
Otherwise I'd have heard
your heart beating.

25:56.920 --> 26:01.080
But timewalking? I mean, even if
I could, I wouldn't know how I did it.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.680
Well, you do realize that your father
was a timewalker, don't you?

26:13.280 --> 26:15.240
Hamish, thanks for agreeing to see me.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.000
You said this was about Sophie.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.080
She wants to speak to the witch,
Matthew's witch, Diana Bishop.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.560
Sophie was born to witches.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.320
I know it sounds mad, but it's true.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.800
You know what I'm risking
even by telling you this.

26:36.760 --> 26:40.440
Right now, Nathaniel and Sophie
are safe. They're anonymous.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.760
You really think that Diana's...

26:46.920 --> 26:48.280
What?

26:49.400 --> 26:52.600
-Savior of the demons?
-Sophie does.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.120
There's so much
that we don't understand.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.280
If demons can be born to witches,

26:59.440 --> 27:02.560
if cross-species families
are possible, then...

27:02.720 --> 27:05.680
everything that we know
about our kind is...

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
Well, it's all up for grabs.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.200
Think what this could mean for us.

27:12.360 --> 27:17.560
Demons can finally have the status
and understanding that we deserve.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.360
Come to make confession, Gerbert?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.880
My conscience is clear.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.520
I trust your family are well?

27:55.680 --> 27:57.920
No. Why would you speak of France?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.440
I assumed that topic
would be a zero-sum game.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.440
Far from it.

28:03.600 --> 28:08.680
It was Juliette here who
offered Satu the use of... La Pierre.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.280
I found out about the outrage...

28:14.960 --> 28:18.400
far too late to intervene.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.520
Miss Durand does very little
without you telling her to.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.040
Not when it comes to your brother.

28:30.320 --> 28:34.520
My dear, tell him
of your meeting with Satu.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.880
You told me you...

28:48.040 --> 28:51.280
offered Satu the castle. You wanted
Diana dealt with. Don't you recall?

28:54.880 --> 28:56.200
No.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.800
-I don't.
-Juliette!

29:22.040 --> 29:23.360
Juliette.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.400
You need to sense where
the danger is more quickly.

29:54.040 --> 29:58.440
What's the one constant
when your powers worked, mm?

29:58.600 --> 30:01.560
Need, simple, instinctive need.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.080
You weren't thinking,
you were feeling.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.920
Agh! Shit!

30:12.240 --> 30:14.880
-I'm sorry. Are you all right?
-No!

30:16.200 --> 30:17.840
You're bleeding.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.880
-I'm fine.
-I won't harm you.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.800
Look at you!

30:26.160 --> 30:28.400
Don't, Diana!

30:29.360 --> 30:31.560
No, look, I've had an idea.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.960
Do you remember that night
at the riverbank?

30:34.120 --> 30:39.480
When you said to me,
"Move past me slowly."

30:39.640 --> 30:43.080
You said, "Do not...

30:46.280 --> 30:47.600
run."

30:51.360 --> 30:52.680
Fuck!

31:00.600 --> 31:03.480
I guess I just need
a little more danger.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.600
That was your first time in trouble.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.520
What's wrong?

33:14.400 --> 33:17.680
There were two women,
two human women.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.320
Not like...

33:20.400 --> 33:22.280
this, not like us.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.240
But I did love them.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.720
And I told...

33:30.160 --> 33:32.240
each of them that they were...

33:34.400 --> 33:35.880
safe with me.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.160
I even believed it.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.240
If I ever harmed you...

33:50.440 --> 33:51.760
Matthew...

33:52.680 --> 33:54.080
you will never harm me.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.280
I'm not human.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.320
I'm powerful.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.720
And you won't hurt me
because you don't want to.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.160
You can't.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.159
I won't let you.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.159
Be nice, Miriam.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.040
Surely, if we're here
to just guard the place,

34:32.199 --> 34:33.880
it's not essential we go inside?

34:34.040 --> 34:36.000
Yeah, but it's not
very sociable, is it?

34:40.600 --> 34:42.120
Hello!

34:42.280 --> 34:44.679
You must be our Miriam and Marcus.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.159
I'm Emily. This is Sarah.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.600
And we're delighted to have you.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.600
Please, come on in. Come on.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.199
After you.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.440
Mi casa, su casa.

35:06.320 --> 35:11.600
How on earth could anyone think
that you're... that you're human?

35:11.760 --> 35:14.680
Sarah, you're hardly inconspicuous
yourself.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.800
The smell of henbane
is coming off you in waves.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.280
You got a problem, Junior?

35:21.440 --> 35:26.120
Oh, no. No, no. It's just, erm...
You look so much like your namesake.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.560
Sarah Bishop, your ancestor.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.840
She taught me how to set a broken leg
at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.560
That is so fascinating, Marcus.
Did you know her well?

35:34.720 --> 35:36.040
Em, enough already!

35:37.200 --> 35:40.360
Can we please not pretend
this is a social call?

35:40.520 --> 35:44.520
Vampires protecting Bishop land?
It isn't gonna work.

35:46.040 --> 35:50.760
-What the hell?
-Look at you. People will talk.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.640
We might as well send a flare
up for the Congregation.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.760
-With respect, Sarah...
-With respect, Matthew...

35:57.760 --> 36:00.120
I've had about enough of you
saying "with respect"

36:00.280 --> 36:03.880
and then doing or saying
whatever you damn please.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.000
-What is going on?
-Magic house.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.920
The house doesn't like it
when we argue.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.200
It smells strange.
I can't quite place it.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.680
-Do you want to be alone?
-No.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.120
-Oh!
-Is that what I think it is?

36:57.280 --> 36:58.680
Ashmole 782.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.040
This is one of the missing pages.

37:01.200 --> 37:04.040
Someone just posted it
to your parents?

37:04.200 --> 37:05.520
What does it mean?

37:07.040 --> 37:08.680
She's wearing Matthew's insignia.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.280
-Here, let me...
-May I?

37:13.080 --> 37:16.520
Didn't you say that the pages
in Oxford had a hidden text?

37:16.680 --> 37:21.320
The words were moving so fast
I couldn't read it.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.600
If it was torn from the book, it's no
wonder that the magic was damaged.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.160
-We need to get it to a lab,
-No need.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.520
I have a still room
and I know just the spell.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.760
You!

38:02.000 --> 38:03.320
Oh, dear.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.720
Technical difficulties?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.880
Why don't you come with me?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.880
Venice is no place
for a witch without magic.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.280
My God!

38:32.440 --> 38:34.520
I know this writing.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.120
He wrote in the manuscript.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.520
Who, your father? In The Book Of Life?

38:47.480 --> 38:49.880
There were two inscriptions
on the first page.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.720
One in ink by Ashmole
and another in pencil.

38:52.880 --> 38:58.680
"In two parts, the first Anatomical,
the second Psychological."

38:58.840 --> 39:02.280
Well, there was no such thing
as psychology in Ashmole's day.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.680
No, I know. I wrote it down
as a late addition at the time.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.440
What an earth is my dad doing
writing in The Book Of Life?

39:11.680 --> 39:14.040
Well, you did see him
outside the Bodleian.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.960
Perhaps he meant for you
to recognize his hand.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.040
That would explain
the anachronistic language.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.440
What if...

39:20.600 --> 39:24.080
he's the reason that you and only you

39:24.240 --> 39:26.880
can summon the manuscript?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.160
I still can't believe
he's a timewalker.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.520
Maybe he meant
for all of this to happen.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.520
I think that he wants you
to have The Book Of Life.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.760
Every last page of it.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.200
Well done, Domenico.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.760
Where is she?
What have you done with Satu?

39:47.920 --> 39:50.000
What happens now?

39:51.160 --> 39:53.360
Will you recall the Congregation?

39:54.440 --> 39:55.760
Not just yet.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.720
Let's have some wine.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.840
And bring her to the back
of the palazzo, would you?

40:05.200 --> 40:07.640
It's funny. I always thought
you hated Matthew.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.440
But it actually suits him, doesn't it?

40:09.600 --> 40:13.480
Having everyone focus on
our errant witch instead of his one.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.640
Satu trespassed on my land,

40:15.800 --> 40:17.680
my ancestral home.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.400
I want to see her suffer before
the Congregation decide her fate.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.040
You know, I think I'll hold on to her.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.000
Just for now.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.480
What do you want, Domenico?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.960
Nothing.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.200
Today, but tomorrow, the day after...

40:41.880 --> 40:43.560
who knows?

40:44.440 --> 40:45.760
I'll be in touch.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.960
That's it, Diana. Open your mind.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.720
Don't think, just let
your powers sense me.

41:06.440 --> 41:10.160
Wouldn't this be more fun if you
just came out here and kissed me?

41:12.160 --> 41:13.480
Okay.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.640
Okay.

41:23.760 --> 41:27.280
I sense a vampiric presence.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.600
No cheating, okay?

41:34.840 --> 41:37.480
Stay exactly...

41:37.640 --> 41:40.000
where you are.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.720
You must be Diana.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.840
She's the most powerful witch
we've ever encountered

41:58.000 --> 42:00.680
and her powers we thought
were extinct have survived.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.080
Oh, please, get to me.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.760
He's gone too far.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.680
He'll put up a fight,
but we can match him.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.640
The Knights will have to take on
the Congregation.

42:10.800 --> 42:14.600
Then we'll throw the De Clermonts
into chaos.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.240
What if we timewalked?

42:17.640 --> 42:20.440
There has to be somewhere
I can learn about my magic.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.880
You do understand we have
a hell of a fight ahead of us.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.360
Been fighting all my life.

42:24.520 --> 42:28.000
Where are Matthew Clairmont
and Diana Bishop?

42:28.680 --> 42:30.240
He's dying.
