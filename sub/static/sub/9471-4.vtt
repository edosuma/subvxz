00:18.972 --> 00:20.251
So maybe we'll circle back around

00:20.272 --> 00:21.638
and then take the... take the back way

00:21.690 --> 00:23.474
to the house this time
because I haven't pissed

00:23.525 --> 00:25.559
on anything back there in recent memory.

00:25.611 --> 00:26.728
Oh, no.

00:26.730 --> 00:27.812
No.

00:27.864 --> 00:29.230
No, no, no, no, no. We can't go...

00:29.282 --> 00:30.481
I can't go in there. No, no, no, no.

00:30.533 --> 00:31.565
Mom.

00:31.568 --> 00:32.734
(chains rattling)

00:32.735 --> 00:36.036
Oh, fuck.

00:36.072 --> 00:37.405

Dog 1: We got a new one! Dog

00:53.015 --> 00:54.054
2: Oh, here we go. Fresh meat.

00:54.090 --> 00:56.057
- Mm! Looking good, sweetheart.

00:56.091 --> 00:57.325
- Woop-woop!
- Uh...

00:57.359 --> 00:58.759
All right, Phil. You got this, man.

00:58.762 --> 00:59.793
You got this.

00:59.829 --> 01:01.396
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

01:01.430 --> 01:03.398
Throwing some dice. So dope.

01:03.432 --> 01:04.766
Keep it together.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.933
Oh, hey. (screams)

01:06.986 --> 01:08.986
Okay, that's yours. That's fine.

01:09.022 --> 01:10.271
(groans)

01:10.272 --> 01:13.274
(grunting)

01:13.275 --> 01:15.075
- Not making eye contact. Just... Oh!
- (growls)

01:15.111 --> 01:16.277
I've locked eyes with him.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.995
He is angry.

01:18.031 --> 01:19.280
Nice teeth, dude.

01:19.331 --> 01:21.114
Floss much?

01:21.117 --> 01:22.516
Oh, hi there.

01:22.551 --> 01:23.584
Oh, h... hey, man. How's it goin'?

01:23.620 --> 01:26.019
Haven't seen you around
the dog park before.

01:26.055 --> 01:27.254
I bet you could use a friend.

01:27.289 --> 01:28.823
Thanks, man. I'm Phil.

01:28.858 --> 01:30.057
Hey, Phil.

01:30.093 --> 01:31.224
It's actually my first time here

01:31.260 --> 01:33.293
and it's a little daunting,
to be honest with you.

01:33.329 --> 01:34.795
(laughs) Anytime, man.

01:34.831 --> 01:36.798
So let me ask you a question.

01:36.832 --> 01:38.132
You're a purebred, right?

01:38.168 --> 01:41.868
Uh, yeah. My mom was a papillon,

01:41.905 --> 01:43.503
so is my dad, so I guess so, yeah.

01:43.539 --> 01:44.572
That's great.

01:44.606 --> 01:46.441
100%. That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:46.475 --> 01:49.176
- Purebreds. (chuckles)
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:49.212 --> 01:51.878
You know what's nice is
when there's another purebred

01:51.914 --> 01:53.614
and we can kind of talk about the mutts.

01:53.650 --> 01:55.348
- Mutts. Gotcha, gotcha.
- Non-purebreds. Yeah.

01:55.384 --> 01:57.350
Um, I'm sorry, but real quick,

01:57.387 --> 01:59.253
what is that right there? Is that a...

01:59.289 --> 02:00.721
- Is that a birthmark?
- Oh, this?

02:00.757 --> 02:02.222
You know, it's just a little marker I got

02:02.257 --> 02:03.524
just to, you know, let people know

02:03.560 --> 02:05.560
- where I'm coming from. A tattoo.
- No. This is great.

02:05.594 --> 02:06.793
Uh, I think I'm good.

02:06.829 --> 02:07.954
I'm just gonna head over to

02:07.980 --> 02:09.187
- the water bowl.
- All right.

02:09.215 --> 02:10.247
- I'll see you around, Phil.
- No.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.382
- You're the man!
- No.

02:11.418 --> 02:12.550
- Good friend right there!
- We're not.

02:12.585 --> 02:14.419
- Hey! Hey, everyone!
- I don't know this guy. No.

02:14.471 --> 02:16.170
- This guy's with me.
- No. I am not with him.

02:16.222 --> 02:18.556
I want it to be clear,
I'm not with this guy.

02:18.591 --> 02:20.508
- Hey, Phil! My buddy Phil!
- No. No.

02:20.509 --> 02:21.759
Okay.

02:21.811 --> 02:23.677
Oh, fucking A.

02:24.681 --> 02:26.379
Hey.

02:26.415 --> 02:28.248
You don't wanna drink from
that side of the trough.

02:28.283 --> 02:29.716
Why?

02:29.752 --> 02:31.185
Oh, boy.

02:31.221 --> 02:32.887
It's the piss side over there, okay?

02:32.921 --> 02:34.405
Oh... (gags) Oh, Jesus!

02:34.441 --> 02:36.073
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you thinkin'?

02:36.109 --> 02:38.492
I... It's my first day here.
I don't know anything, man.

02:38.527 --> 02:40.127
I should've known. Look at you. Huh.

02:40.163 --> 02:41.528
I'm just kidding, man. What's up?

02:41.563 --> 02:42.963
- I'm Mike. How's it goin', man?
- Hey.

02:42.998 --> 02:44.799
- Good. Phil.
- What are you in for?

02:44.834 --> 02:46.134
I didn't fuckin' do anything, dude.

02:46.168 --> 02:47.468
I'm innocent.

02:47.503 --> 02:48.637
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

02:48.662 --> 02:49.603
- (laughs)
- (laughs awkwardly)

02:49.639 --> 02:51.338
We're all innocent when
we're in the park, huh?

02:51.373 --> 02:52.408
What are you here for?

02:52.433 --> 02:53.594
- I mean, do you...
- (sniffs)

02:53.610 --> 02:55.276
Exercise and recreation.

02:55.311 --> 02:57.277
Yeah? Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57.312 --> 02:58.362
I'm kind of a veteran of the

02:58.388 --> 02:59.413
- park, actually,
- Oh, nice.

02:59.449 --> 03:01.414
- So you kind of found the guy.
- Sick.

03:01.450 --> 03:03.050
Look, if you want to survive here,

03:03.086 --> 03:04.697
you gotta play by the rules of the park.

03:04.722 --> 03:05.286
You're right.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.320
- Number one...
- Mm-hmm?

03:06.355 --> 03:07.989
Do not touch anything that is not yours.

03:08.024 --> 03:09.723
- Okay. That's cool.
- Okay, and this is very important,

03:09.759 --> 03:11.626
- and I can tell you why. No, I get it.
- Ooh, there's a ball.

03:11.661 --> 03:13.221
No... What are you...
Phil, what are you doing?

03:13.246 --> 03:14.228
It was a ball. It was a ball.

03:14.264 --> 03:15.903
- Dude, I just said this, man.
- Angela: Ahem.

03:15.931 --> 03:17.865
Excuse you.

03:17.901 --> 03:19.266
What's in your mouth right now?

03:19.301 --> 03:22.270
Uh, just a ball. It's
actually really good.

03:22.305 --> 03:23.670
It's, like, one of the blue chewy ones.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.573
- Mm-hmm...
- It's still warm, which is great.

03:25.608 --> 03:27.875
Do you taste anything
familiar on that? Hold on.

03:27.911 --> 03:29.477
- (hawks, spits)
- Oh, my God.

03:29.512 --> 03:30.844
Yeah, yeah. You taste that on the ball?

03:30.879 --> 03:32.013
- Yeah.
- 'Cause that's my spit.

03:32.048 --> 03:33.146
- Phil: Oh, yeah.
- That's her spit, bro.

03:33.182 --> 03:34.682
- That's her spit, bro.
- I got it. Thank you.

03:34.716 --> 03:36.751
She spit right in my
face, so I really got that

03:36.786 --> 03:38.406
- right off the bat.
- Now, why

03:38.432 --> 03:40.388
would my spit be on that ball?

03:40.423 --> 03:42.423
I know. I know exactly why.

03:42.457 --> 03:43.623
Why would it be there?

03:43.659 --> 03:46.127
I'm not sure. Is it... Is it your ball?

03:46.162 --> 03:48.228
- Is that it?
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

03:48.264 --> 03:49.296
- ding, ding, ding, ding.
- Okay.

03:49.331 --> 03:50.831
- Dinga linga ling, yo.
- Tell him what he's won.

03:50.866 --> 03:52.300
Yeah, I'm not sure what's happening here.

03:52.335 --> 03:53.533
This is a lot to take in at once.

03:53.569 --> 03:55.635
I'm pretty sure they put the
balls in here for all of us,

03:55.671 --> 03:58.139
- so it shouldn't be...
- (all laughing)

03:58.174 --> 04:00.341
What are you... Why are
you guys laughing so much?

04:00.376 --> 04:02.210
- Oh, man.
- What is this?

04:02.245 --> 04:04.645
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, wrong. So wrong.

04:04.681 --> 04:06.781
- Incorrect? Okay.
- Angela, um... (laughs)

04:06.816 --> 04:08.549
Sorry. How's it going? Mike from before.

04:08.574 --> 04:09.182
Angela: Yeah.

04:09.218 --> 04:10.951
Um, so sorry about Phil...

04:10.986 --> 04:13.521
- Enough talk.
- (coughs)

04:13.556 --> 04:16.524
Homeboy, you and me are gonna dance.

04:16.559 --> 04:17.992
Oh, shit.

04:18.026 --> 04:18.959
- Phil: Okay...
- Yeah.

04:18.995 --> 04:21.829
When the shadows cover the Karen,

04:21.863 --> 04:25.399
we're gonna have us a
good, old-fashion showdown.

04:25.435 --> 04:27.201
Dun, dun. dun...

04:27.237 --> 04:28.569
What is... No.

04:28.605 --> 04:29.637
- All right.
- No.

04:29.672 --> 04:31.404
- Fine. Whatever. - Yeah,
old-fashion showdown.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.841
Old-fashion showdown is going down.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.141
Yeah, it's going down hardcore. Oh, boy.

04:35.177 --> 04:37.478
- Cool. No, I heard her.
- That's a lot of trouble.

04:37.512 --> 04:38.889
You did hear her. You heard what she said.

04:38.913 --> 04:39.348
I did. Yeah.

04:39.382 --> 04:40.331
Old-fashioned showdown. It's

04:40.356 --> 04:41.314
an old-fashioned showdown.

04:41.350 --> 04:42.521
When that shadow falls on Karen,

04:42.545 --> 04:43.627
you're gonna shit yourself.

04:43.653 --> 04:44.730
You know, she's not here anymore,

04:44.754 --> 04:45.552
- so you guys can...
- What?

04:45.588 --> 04:47.221
- An... Angela, wait up!
- Angela?

04:47.257 --> 04:49.790
- Angela?
- Elmo, come on!

05:27.747 --> 05:30.581
Truthfully, your... your
head looks crazy to me.

05:30.617 --> 05:31.999
- I've never seen anything like it.
- It does?

05:32.034 --> 05:33.334
Do you think I should get a new one?

05:33.369 --> 05:34.713
It's like a bulb. It's like a lightbulb.

05:34.737 --> 05:35.336
What should I do?

05:35.370 --> 05:37.004
It fits inside my owner's mouth.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.172
- No.
- Yeah!

05:38.206 --> 05:39.673
- Ugh.
- Do you think I'm ugly?

05:39.709 --> 05:41.042
No! I think you're beautiful.

05:41.093 --> 05:42.709
I think you're young, and
that's not an insult.

05:42.711 --> 05:44.377
I am... Stop saying... I'm not young.

05:44.379 --> 05:46.463
I'm in heat right now,
okay? You're one years old.

05:46.516 --> 05:48.382
- How are you in heat?
- God, you're just a baby.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.850
- Don't try to grow up too fast.
- I am not a baby!

05:49.886 --> 05:51.031
I marked something the other

05:51.055 --> 05:52.159
day with my lady juices.

05:52.187 --> 05:53.387
You peed on something.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.221
No, I lady juiced it. "Lady juices..."

05:55.223 --> 05:56.439
- Oh, my God.
- I lady juiced it!

05:56.475 --> 05:58.274
And they left the TV
on this horrible movie

05:58.310 --> 05:59.560
for, like, eight hours.

05:59.562 --> 06:00.379
It was just playing over

06:00.403 --> 06:01.196
- and over again.
- Okay.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.896
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

06:02.899 --> 06:04.531
- I'm pregnant. I think.
- What?!

06:04.567 --> 06:06.233
- Who's the father?
- Oh, my gosh. Be quiet.

06:06.285 --> 06:07.567
I'm sorry. I'm shocked. I don't want...

06:07.620 --> 06:09.403
I know, but just listen.

06:09.454 --> 06:11.738
- Who is it?
- It was a schnauzer, okay?

06:11.790 --> 06:14.240
- Oh, my God.
- We met at doggy day care.

06:14.293 --> 06:15.564
- I don't know. It's just...
- Oh, my God.

06:15.589 --> 06:16.543
How many do you think it is?

06:16.579 --> 06:17.995
Feels like a real pack.

06:18.047 --> 06:19.163
Your belly does look really big.

06:19.214 --> 06:20.497
I thought you were just gaining weight.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.269
- You noticed?
- Yeah, but I was just happy.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.300
I thought maybe you were

06:23.305 --> 06:24.305
- getting good food.
- No.

06:24.336 --> 06:25.417
Still not getting anything.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.088
They're struggling with money.

06:27.089 --> 06:29.423
- You cannot tell anybody.
- I won't, I won't, I won't.

06:29.425 --> 06:31.091
- It's really a secret.
- Okay.

06:33.562 --> 06:36.129
Nobody mentioned my birthday.

06:36.165 --> 06:37.997
- All: Oh...
- It's okay.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.066
- Happy birthday.
- No, it's okay.

06:39.101 --> 06:40.266
- Sorry.
- Happy birthday.

06:40.302 --> 06:41.769
- It's fine.
- Is that today?

06:41.803 --> 06:43.269
- Yeah, it's today.
- Roughly.

06:43.305 --> 06:44.637
(straining)

06:44.673 --> 06:46.473
- Um...
- (straining)

06:46.542 --> 06:47.841
Sorry, do you hear that?

06:47.877 --> 06:49.076
I just... I thought...

06:49.112 --> 06:50.329
- I thought we were shitting.
- Oh, my God.

06:50.355 --> 06:50.877
You're hunching.

06:50.913 --> 06:52.346
- Oh, my God. Don't hunch!
- What? No!

06:52.382 --> 06:53.814
You're just supposed to dip right now.

06:53.850 --> 06:55.033
Okay. I know. I'm sucking it back in.

06:55.058 --> 06:55.750
Hollie: That is so...

06:55.784 --> 06:57.247
- You can't suck it back in.
- Wow. Right...

06:57.273 --> 06:58.319
right in front of all of us.

06:58.353 --> 06:59.786
- I did. I just sucked one back in.
- No!

06:59.822 --> 07:01.488
- No! Oh, my God.
- Hollie: Let it out.

07:01.524 --> 07:02.920
Now we're gonna
think about how it's inside

07:02.946 --> 07:04.190
your little butt the rest of the walk.

07:04.226 --> 07:05.358
Don't think about my little butt.

07:05.394 --> 07:06.761
I don't like when you think about it.

07:06.795 --> 07:08.295
Oh, they're like rabbit pellets.

07:08.331 --> 07:09.309
They're not like rabbit pellets.

07:09.334 --> 07:10.163
Are these rabbit pellets?

07:10.199 --> 07:11.665
Don't say that. I almost
wanna shit right now

07:11.701 --> 07:12.833
just to show you how big mine is.

07:12.869 --> 07:14.567
- Poop on my poop so you cover it.
- Both: No. Ew.

07:14.603 --> 07:16.103
- Sugar: Please?
- This is so gross.

07:16.139 --> 07:17.139
She's doing it.

07:17.173 --> 07:19.206
Now that's a healthy poop. See?

07:19.242 --> 07:21.307
That's tubular. It's not little pellets.

07:21.343 --> 07:22.343
It's radical.

07:24.747 --> 07:26.613
You think we have a lot of leashes now,

07:26.649 --> 07:28.115
just think about when the puppies come.

07:28.151 --> 07:29.417
- Josie, right?
- What? Hollie!

07:29.451 --> 07:31.485
- What? Oh, my God.
- Wait, what?!

07:31.521 --> 07:32.721
- You told her?!
- Mabel, what

07:32.728 --> 07:34.021
the fuck did you just say?

07:34.055 --> 07:35.274
What the fuck to you! What's going on?

07:35.298 --> 07:36.023
What? What's going on?

07:36.057 --> 07:37.257
That was a secret, you idiot.

07:37.293 --> 07:38.225
No, that was a secret from me!

07:38.250 --> 07:39.125
I'm not an... How was I...

07:39.161 --> 07:40.995
I know, but I had to tell somebody.

07:41.029 --> 07:41.997
- I couldn't just sit there.
- Why

07:42.023 --> 07:43.062
did you have to tell somebody?

07:43.098 --> 07:44.564
Did everybody know except me?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.867
- Okay. Yes, I'm pregnant. (gasps)
- Oh, my God!

07:46.903 --> 07:48.235
I think that's wonderful. Me too.

07:48.271 --> 07:50.904
- Hollie: It is good.
- No, it's the worst news ever.

07:50.939 --> 07:52.372
I mean, it's not good at all.

07:52.408 --> 07:54.108
Why? Puppies are amazing.

07:54.143 --> 07:55.810
- Life is extraordinary.
- No.

07:55.845 --> 07:57.845
- I know, but I'm...
- Life truly is.

07:57.879 --> 08:00.180
Well, for some. But I live in a cage

08:00.216 --> 08:01.576
and now I'm gonna have puppies and

08:01.596 --> 08:02.850
they're never gonna let me out.

08:02.884 --> 08:06.153
This is the best part of my
day, is being with you guys.

08:06.189 --> 08:07.721
- Josie...
- You're gonna get to be with us!

08:07.757 --> 08:08.788
- I doubt it.
- Of course you will.

08:08.824 --> 08:11.024
Well, I love you, and
I love the little lives

08:11.060 --> 08:13.093
you have in you, and if
you need help delivering,

08:13.129 --> 08:14.627
please call out to me.

08:14.663 --> 08:16.896
Howl. I'm just down the street from you.

08:16.932 --> 08:19.500
And I consider you my
closest friend in this group.

08:19.535 --> 08:21.735
- What? Why would you say that?
- Wow. Right in front of us.

08:21.737 --> 08:23.403
- Thank you.
- What? I wanted her to feel safe.

08:23.439 --> 08:24.872
Well, I know, but that
was... Can we listen

08:24.874 --> 08:26.290
to your... to your belly? Can I listen?

08:26.341 --> 08:27.457
Oh, really? Yeah.

08:27.509 --> 08:29.043
- Is that okay?
- I'll be, like, their...

08:29.095 --> 08:31.127
um, like, their sister and their friend.

08:31.180 --> 08:32.929
I mean, like, their... you
know, but like a bigger sister

08:32.965 --> 08:34.849
and, like, a wise friend.

08:34.884 --> 08:36.549
♪ ♪

08:40.523 --> 08:41.971
Okay, dude, you do not want to get

08:42.024 --> 08:43.807
- in a showdown with Angela.
- Why? What... what is it?

08:43.860 --> 08:44.892
- Dude.
- I don't get it.

08:44.894 --> 08:46.559
Okay, I've seen her
go against other dogs,

08:46.611 --> 08:47.794
and it is not pretty, man.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.096
- I'm telling you.
- What happens to them?

08:49.130 --> 08:50.197
What happens to the dogs, dude?

08:50.232 --> 08:51.298
Dude, she's gonna eat you alive.

08:51.334 --> 08:52.365
She's gonna eat me?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.134
Look, man, we gotta
get out of this park.

08:54.169 --> 08:55.702
- And we have to do it now.
- Okay.

08:55.738 --> 08:57.171
What do you got? What do you got?

08:57.206 --> 08:58.739
- What's the move?
- All right, I got two plans.

08:58.774 --> 09:01.008
- Okay.
- Okay, so here's plan A.

09:01.043 --> 09:02.243
- Oh.
- If you just take a look at that.

09:02.278 --> 09:03.376
- This is a map I drew.
- Wow.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.539
That's you and that's

09:04.565 --> 09:05.854
- me right there.
- Okay.

09:05.881 --> 09:08.749
And that is a loose
blueprint of the underground tunnel

09:08.801 --> 09:10.009
that we would dig, and that

09:10.034 --> 09:11.219
- would pop us out
- Okay...

09:11.254 --> 09:13.888
- into rural Vermont, and...
- What is Vermont?

09:13.923 --> 09:15.855
Vermont is a... it's a... it's a place.

09:15.892 --> 09:16.990
- Sorry.
- You know, it's fine.

09:17.025 --> 09:18.392
That's our house right there.

09:18.427 --> 09:19.826
That's my vegetable garden right there.

09:19.861 --> 09:21.061
What are these right here?

09:21.096 --> 09:22.616
What do they have to do with anything?

09:22.631 --> 09:24.331
Those are... just hearts. Is that a...

09:24.366 --> 09:26.667
Just to signify the atmosphere

09:26.701 --> 09:29.036
of camaraderie that we
would be experiencing

09:29.071 --> 09:30.703
- in our own house in Vermont.
- Got it. That's cool.

09:30.740 --> 09:31.859
- That's all that is.
- Let's just

09:31.884 --> 09:32.940
real quick go over plan B.

09:32.975 --> 09:34.408
- Sure. Uh...
- You said you had two plans, right?

09:34.442 --> 09:35.509
So there's a second one?

09:35.544 --> 09:37.211
Plan B is we just wait for
the gate right over there

09:37.245 --> 09:38.013
to open and then we

09:38.038 --> 09:38.779
- just run out
- Oh.

09:38.813 --> 09:40.447
- And we're free from the park.
- Because people just

09:40.482 --> 09:41.610
- come in and out.
- Because the people

09:41.634 --> 09:42.549
come in and out of the gate.

09:42.585 --> 09:43.985
- Okay, cool.
- I'm really right now

09:43.985 --> 09:45.653
leaning towards plan B.

09:45.687 --> 09:47.498
Just because it's right there and it's

09:47.523 --> 09:49.123
- really easy... I'm sorry.
- Plan...

09:49.158 --> 09:50.057
I think we got... I just want...

09:50.091 --> 09:51.292
- The gate option.
- The gate one. Yeah.

09:51.326 --> 09:52.592
- Yup. Yup.
- Just going right out the gate.

09:52.628 --> 09:53.961
Right out of the gate.

09:53.995 --> 09:55.895
All right. All right, plan B.

09:55.932 --> 09:58.331
- Did I not explain A enough?
- Oh, my God.

09:58.366 --> 10:00.634
- I see it!
- I feel like I didn't fully...

10:00.686 --> 10:03.052
Mm. Well, well, well...

10:03.105 --> 10:05.405
- what have I found here?
- Phil: Oh, no.

10:05.441 --> 10:06.874
- It's nothing.
- Looks like a map!

10:06.908 --> 10:08.841
You boys weren't thinking
about escaping now, were you?

10:08.878 --> 10:10.210
- No. No, we weren't.
- That's just a...

10:10.245 --> 10:12.111
that was just a goof thing.
That was just a funny thing.

10:12.148 --> 10:13.246
Mm. And what are these? Hearts?

10:13.282 --> 10:14.981
- Hearts.
- (all laugh)

10:15.017 --> 10:16.716
Again with the
hearts. It's not a big deal.

10:16.751 --> 10:18.511
- We don't need to focus on that.
- Shut up, Mike.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.801
- Cool.
- Let me tear this to shreds.

10:19.822 --> 10:21.238
Oh, snap! Oh, snap!

10:21.289 --> 10:23.157
Look at that.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.491
(giggles) I feel so good now.

10:25.543 --> 10:27.494
- She just tore up your map.
- She's really mean.

10:27.495 --> 10:29.363
Hm. Looks like the Karen

10:29.398 --> 10:31.030
is halfway covered.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.499
Ronnie: The time is coming.

10:32.534 --> 10:33.667
You are so screwed.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.052
Remember, when she's fully covered...

10:35.086 --> 10:36.720
- You're gonna be dead, man.
- Yeah.

10:36.755 --> 10:37.971
A showdown's gonna happen.

10:38.006 --> 10:39.907
You didn't do what she said.
Now you gotta have a showdown.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.062
- You're in trouble, boy.
- Yeah.

10:41.076 --> 10:43.277
Why do I surround
myself with these ninnies?

10:43.312 --> 10:44.602
- What?
- Mm, sorry. I was

10:44.628 --> 10:46.245
saying my thoughts again.

10:46.282 --> 10:47.681
Oh. All right. Yeah. I mean, it's fine.

10:47.716 --> 10:49.350
You're probably talking about
these two guys, huh?

10:49.384 --> 10:50.517
- Not, you know, me and Elmo.
- Right.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.985
She was probably talking about them two

10:52.020 --> 10:53.320
is what you were saying, right?

10:53.355 --> 10:54.635
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah, probably.

10:54.657 --> 10:55.570
- Yeah.
- You don't wanna... wanna

10:55.595 --> 10:56.423
hurt your support system.

10:56.459 --> 10:58.424
- You know, that's the foundation.
- Ugh.

10:58.461 --> 11:01.227
Eat my dust. I'm outta here.

11:01.263 --> 11:03.330
- Um...
- Very crude.

11:03.365 --> 11:05.065
That was a very
crude exchange with Angela.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.764
I'm gonna follow her
'cause I do think this is a test.

11:06.788 --> 11:07.725
Cool. Yeah, I'mma follow you.

11:07.753 --> 11:08.653
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good.

11:08.678 --> 11:09.586
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

11:09.621 --> 11:11.038
All right. Plan B.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.121
Just run out the gate.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.506
Okay. You call it, man.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.091
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, dude.

11:15.126 --> 11:16.289
Dude, I just wanna say beforehand...

11:16.315 --> 11:16.677
Go ahead.

11:16.711 --> 11:17.991
- You're my best friend, man,
- Yeah.

11:18.014 --> 11:19.712
- And really enjoyed, like,
- No, you're my best friend.

11:19.764 --> 11:20.667
Hanging out with you today...

11:20.692 --> 11:21.381
Okay, it's open! Go!

11:21.384 --> 11:22.384
- Go, go, go!
- Okay!

11:26.221 --> 11:27.270
Ah!

11:27.306 --> 11:28.306
Shit!

11:29.557 --> 11:31.225
- Dude, what happened?
- I don't know! I tripped!

11:31.226 --> 11:32.725
I fuckin... My paw got
caught on the wood chips.

11:32.778 --> 11:34.311
- The gate's closed, dude!
- I'm out here! I know.

11:34.363 --> 11:35.602
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Fuck.

11:35.614 --> 11:38.097
You're free and... and
this is what you've wanted.

11:38.134 --> 11:39.265
You can go now, dude! Go!

11:39.301 --> 11:41.000
I can't do it without you, man!

11:41.037 --> 11:43.370
You're my second
half! You're my best friend!

11:43.405 --> 11:44.871
I'll find you when I get out, okay?

11:44.907 --> 11:46.974
- You're out of the clink.
- I'm out of the clink.

11:47.009 --> 11:48.370
Yeah, dude. You got
it. You're saying it.

11:48.394 --> 11:49.308
Yeah. I'm out of the clink.

11:49.345 --> 11:50.443
- Go! Run!
- Okay.

11:50.479 --> 11:52.278
- Run!
- Okay.

11:52.313 --> 11:54.630
Run free, Mike. Run free.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.749
I'm doin' it.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.167
I'm doin' it, Philly.

11:57.219 --> 11:58.418
Just like we said.

11:58.421 --> 11:59.653
(alarm sounds)

12:04.460 --> 12:05.842
No! Mike look out!

12:05.894 --> 12:07.226
I made it.

12:07.263 --> 12:08.928
I'm finally free.

12:10.765 --> 12:11.849
- (gunshot)
- (whimpers)

12:11.900 --> 12:14.268
Miiiiiike!

12:14.320 --> 12:16.019
(coughs)

12:17.188 --> 12:18.938
I sees it.

12:18.941 --> 12:20.691
- Vermont.
- (mooing)

12:20.743 --> 12:22.909
Better than I ever dreamt.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.245
I made it, Philly.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.379
I did it.

12:26.414 --> 12:29.332
(footsteps approach)

12:29.368 --> 12:30.701
(grunts)

12:30.753 --> 12:32.870
Is it true what they say?

12:32.922 --> 12:36.173
That all dogs go to heaven?

12:36.207 --> 12:38.042
You know, like the movie?

12:40.962 --> 12:42.462
- (sniffles)
- Well, that didn't work.

12:42.498 --> 12:43.897
- No, it did not.
- Um...

12:43.932 --> 12:45.099
What are we gonna do now?

12:45.134 --> 12:47.567
Okay, well, the Karen
is almost entirely covered

12:47.602 --> 12:48.802
at this point, so...

12:48.837 --> 12:50.059
I guess I'm just gonna do what

12:50.085 --> 12:51.404
I do whenever there's trouble.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.039
I'm gonna go play dead in
the corner over there.

12:53.075 --> 12:55.241
You just play dead and give up?

12:55.277 --> 12:56.309
Yes, dude.

12:56.345 --> 12:58.111
Okay? I'm not the alpha dog.

12:58.147 --> 12:59.580
And newsflash, neither are you.

12:59.615 --> 13:01.815
Yeah, well, maybe I'm
not, but you know what?

13:01.850 --> 13:04.217
I'm sick of rolling over on my back

13:04.253 --> 13:05.253
and playing dead.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.587
And I'm sick of small dogs like us

13:07.623 --> 13:09.523
getting pushed around by
big dogs like Angela.

13:09.557 --> 13:11.658
Now, I'm gonna enter this showdown

13:11.693 --> 13:13.259
and whatever happens happens.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.095
I'm gonna stand up to
Angela once and for all.

13:15.130 --> 13:16.130
That big bitch.

13:16.164 --> 13:17.764
Whoa. What? What? What is it?

13:17.799 --> 13:19.265
"Bitch"? I just... I don't...

13:19.301 --> 13:21.100

20:57.392 --> 20:59.025
was, you know, as a dog,

20:59.060 --> 21:01.694
you don't always get
these kind of meaty roles.

21:01.730 --> 21:03.496
You know, there's a deep emotion there.

21:03.531 --> 21:06.700
Like, "Where does this... this
hatred come from for Charles?"

21:06.734 --> 21:08.768
You know? It's been a
fantastic experience.

21:08.804 --> 21:11.003
I normally was doing a lot of stage work,

21:11.038 --> 21:13.272
uh, in the West End. E... excuse me.

21:13.307 --> 21:14.840
Can... can you get out of my face?

21:14.875 --> 21:16.088
I'm sorry, sir. Here's your...

21:16.114 --> 21:17.554
- here's your latte.
- Oh, thank you.

21:17.578 --> 21:18.957
How did it take you an hour to get

21:18.981 --> 21:20.413
- me this small drink?
- I apologize...

21:20.449 --> 21:21.847
There's a line and then we have to...

21:21.883 --> 21:22.846
- I'm so sorry.
- You mind getting

21:22.872 --> 21:23.650
out of the shot, mate?

21:23.684 --> 21:25.218
Am... am I still in it?
We're still filming here.

21:25.253 --> 21:26.452
- I'm still in it?
- Yeah. We're filming.

21:26.488 --> 21:27.807
- We're filming, mate.
- I'm so sorry.

21:27.823 --> 21:30.123
Anyway, it's been a great experience.
