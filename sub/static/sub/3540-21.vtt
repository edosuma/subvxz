00:02.135 --> 00:03.500
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.670 --> 00:06.332
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.474
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.804
Johnathan Gilbert had an invention
that was stolen by a vampire.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.378
- Her name was Pearl.
- I gave your device to Damon.

00:14.547 --> 00:15.980
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

00:17.650 --> 00:20.380
Mom! Mom! Mama!

00:20.553 --> 00:24.216
My wife, Isobel, spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.154
- What have you done?
- I turned her.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.851
- Why do I look like Katherine?
- You were adopted.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.192
This girl showed up,
16 and about to give birth.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.833
- What else do you know?
- Isobel.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.231
Stop looking.
She doesn't wanna know you.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.066
She's alive?
Does that mean that she's a...?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.604
Hello, Ric.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.939
Isobel.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.782
It's good to see you.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.912
You look good.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.884
I hear that you're a high school
history teacher?

00:57.390 --> 01:01.190
- How is that?
- Where have you been, Isobel?

01:01.361 --> 01:05.194
I don't have any reasons
that are gonna comfort you.

01:05.364 --> 01:10.200
I don't have any explanations
that are gonna satisfy you.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.162
I wanted this.

01:12.305 --> 01:15.069
- It's that simple?
- Yeah.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.574
You were supposed to mourn me
and move on.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.872
You were my wife.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.439
And I loved you.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.308
How could I not search for you?

01:28.955 --> 01:31.048
Because I wasn't lost, Ric.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.922
I understand
that you know my daughter, Elena.

01:37.097 --> 01:42.467
And I hear that she's been looking
for me.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.333
So I want you to arrange
for a meeting with us.

01:49.409 --> 01:53.311
You want me, ahem,
to deliver a message?

01:54.347 --> 01:55.837
Yeah.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.283
Screw you.

02:03.423 --> 02:04.822
You selfish bitch.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.604 --> 02:19.299
What do you want from me?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.633
- I told you.
- I'm not gonna do anything for you.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.481
You better tell Elena that I wanna meet.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.982
Or I'm gonna start killing the citizens
of this town one by one.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.815
And I'm gonna start
with your History students.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.013
Got it?

02:59.746 --> 03:03.045
I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic
float for the Founder's Day Parade.

03:03.216 --> 03:07.676
If I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline.
But I wanted to check in first.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.847
- Well, I'm doing great. Thanks for asking.
- Check in on Stefan.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.926
Oh, him? Oh, he's... He's terrible.

03:15.995 --> 03:17.019
What's the matter?

03:18.031 --> 03:21.023
He's just back to boring, strait-laced,
off the junk.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.160
You've successfully cured him of anything
that was interesting about his personality.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.671
- Don't forget who helped me.
- I hate myself.

03:30.577 --> 03:34.911
Hey, did Uncle John mention anything
to you about my field trip with the teacher?

03:35.081 --> 03:37.879
No, I've still been avoiding him.
Why? What's he up to?

03:38.051 --> 03:41.509
- I'd love it if you could find out for me.
- I gotta go. I'm late.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.512
Have fun with the Mystic queen.
I know I did.

03:52.699 --> 03:53.825
Elena called.

04:02.275 --> 04:07.542
So these are the specs for the History
Department's Founder's Day float.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.376
We're gonna be re-creating
the Battle of Willow Creek.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.575
Tyler's been nominated
to head up the design.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.482
- By who?
- By me. I've seen your sketches.

04:15.655 --> 04:20.058
- I'm not really into the whole...
- You just pick your team, be creative and...

04:21.094 --> 04:22.118
And don't screw up.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.464
Great.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.997
You wanna help me out with this?

04:28.434 --> 04:29.458
Not really, no.

04:31.371 --> 04:35.432
- Hey, Mr. Saltzman.
- Come with me. We need to talk.

04:36.909 --> 04:37.967
All right, show me.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.305
Let's reference
last year's Miss Mystic Float.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.916
This was what they did last year.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.879
- And it's exactly what we don't want to do.
- Ew.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.458
- Yeah.
- Okay. So, what are we doing?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.753
- Southern classic elegance.
- Gone With the Wind?

04:56.162 --> 04:58.756
- How'd you know?
- You channel Scarlett daily.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.894
So true.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.002
Ugh. Where's Elena?
She's supposed to be helping.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.200
I don't know.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.600
Okay, what's the deal?

05:09.175 --> 05:11.405
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

05:11.544 --> 05:14.012
You and Elena are fighting. Spill.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.114
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.943
You know, this whole float...

05:18.117 --> 05:21.109
...is supposed to be about friends
creating something together...

05:21.287 --> 05:22.982
...and everyone is fighting.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.953
Matt and Tyler hate each other.

05:25.124 --> 05:28.616
You and Elena are on the outs.
I just... I don't like it.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.295
And I can't fix it
if I don't know what's wrong.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.735
I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.202
Damon. Thanks for coming.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.438
Sorry I'm late. The dog ate my, uh...

05:49.716 --> 05:51.149
Never mind.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.850
- What's with all the furrowed brows?
- I saw Isobel last night.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.819
Isobel's here?

06:01.994 --> 06:03.461
In town?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.405
- You're late.
- Didn't realize I was on a schedule.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.008
What's with the sideshow?

06:51.144 --> 06:55.205
Cherie is a little jazz singer
that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.282
And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo
in Amarillo.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.817
- He's gay?
- Not right now.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.818
He's very good to me. Hey, Cherie?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.731
I'm teaching them French.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.431
Ooh. I can smell the judgment
coming off of you.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.628
Well, they're people,
and you're treating them like they're dolls.

07:19.806 --> 07:23.333
If we're gonna be partners,
you really have to stop being such a hater.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.773
We're in a partnership
because we share a goal.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.971
Don't ever confuse that
for an acceptance of your lifestyle.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.479
My lifestyle?

07:32.418 --> 07:35.910
So I assume
that you still don't have the invention.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.646
I'll get it. I said I would.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.356
You threatened to expose Damon Salvatore.
That didn't work.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.462
You killed that Pearl lady.
Still no invention.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.463
I really don't think
that your plan is working, John.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.295
Well, you being here
isn't going to help anything.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.474
You failed, John.
I'm gonna take it from here.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.711
Did you ask about Uncle John?

08:01.881 --> 08:03.849
- Are they working together?
- No.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.847
- No, they're not?
- No, I didn't ask.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.883
- What about the invention?
- Didn't ask.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.317
- She know about the tomb vampires?
- I don't know.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.151
Did words completely escape you?

08:12.325 --> 08:16.193
I was a little too distracted by
my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.

08:16.362 --> 08:18.990
- What's she want?
- She wants to see me, Damon.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.228
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.

08:26.405 --> 08:29.238
You don't have to see her
if you don't want to.

08:29.475 --> 08:33.707
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.

08:34.212 --> 08:35.544
Oh.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.707
I take it that's not okay with you guys?

08:40.620 --> 08:41.678
I wanna do it.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.487
I wanna meet her.
If I don't, I know I'll regret it.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.033
Thanks.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.439
Can you hear me?

09:08.447 --> 09:10.415
Thanks for coming.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.008
I'm nervous.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.388
But I'm happy that you're here.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.589
I love you.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.193
I love you.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.172
Hello, Elena.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.718
You look just like her.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.787
It's eerie.

09:49.989 --> 09:53.425
- You've met Katherine?
- She found me after I turned.

09:53.593 --> 09:58.189
Genetic curiosity, I suppose.
She would be fascinated by you.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.790
Is that how you can walk in the day?

10:01.968 --> 10:03.401
Katherine helped me obtain it.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.494
- Who's my father?
- Not important.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.004
- A teenage waste of space.
- A name would be nice.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.006
It would, wouldn't it?
You ask a lot of questions.

10:13.346 --> 10:17.646
Why did you compel that man to kill himself
after he told me to stop looking for you?

10:17.817 --> 10:20.786
Dramatic impact.
Wish it would've been more effective.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.912
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.151
It's just part of being what I am.

10:29.996 --> 10:33.864
No, it's not. I know other vampires.
That's not true.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.968
You mean your boyfriend over there
by the pool table?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.763
Stefan Salvatore.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.271
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?

10:42.441 --> 10:43.965
Or do you enjoy them both...

10:44.944 --> 10:46.878
...like Katherine did?

10:53.619 --> 10:55.610
- We should be in there.
- No.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.120
Isobel made it clear
we're not to step foot inside.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.782
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
- You're not gonna kill her, period.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.952
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.030
She's my wife.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.632
Was. Was my wife.

11:08.801 --> 11:12.635
I looked for the woman I married,
but she wasn't there. Whoever that is...

11:13.039 --> 11:14.904
...is cold and detached.
- Yeah.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.342
- She's given up her humanity.
- See, I don't get that.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.474
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.979
You kill people,
but I see something human in you.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.640
But with her, there was...

11:26.485 --> 11:27.577
There was nothing.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.357
You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.517
I mean, Stefan's different.
He wants the human experience.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.391
He wants to feel every episode
of How I Met Your Mother...

11:38.564 --> 11:40.031
...so he shuts his feelings out.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.896
The problem is, as a vampire,
your instinct is not to feel.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.334
Isobel chose the easier road.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.703
No guilt, no shame.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.206
No regret. I mean, come on.
If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.679
- You haven't.
- Of course I have, Ric.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.841
That's why I'm so fun to be around.

12:02.688 --> 12:06.215
Why did you wanna meet me?
It can't be to just catch up.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.221
Because I'm curious about you.

12:09.829 --> 12:13.890
But the real reason

12:14.066 --> 12:15.624
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.363
How do you know my uncle?

12:18.537 --> 12:21.199
I used to spend a lot of time here
when I was younger.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.534
John had a crush on me for years.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.075
He was the first one
that told me about vampires.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.712
So, what made you wanna be one?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.405
It's a very long list of reasons, Elena...

12:30.583 --> 12:33.609
...all of which
I'm sure you've thought about.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.052
That was your first lie.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.115
It's inevitable.
You're gonna get old, Stefan won't.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.423
Forever doesn't last very long
when you're human.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.398
I'm sorry, but I don't have
what you're looking for.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.469
Sit down.
And tell your boyfriend to walk away.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.013
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.413
I know that. But Damon does.

13:06.585 --> 13:09.679
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.955
Then the blood will be on your hands.

13:20.666 --> 13:23.100
It was nice meeting you, Elena.

13:56.435 --> 14:00.337
Hey, Anna. Uh, where are you?
What's up? Uh...

14:01.540 --> 14:03.872
Give me a call when you get this.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.512
How is Anna?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.875
I like that girl. She has fire.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.217
Uh, I don't know.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.875
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?

14:15.988 --> 14:18.650
No, no trouble.
Anna just owes me a call, that's it.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.952
Is that the girl that I saw you with
at the Founder's Pageant?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.387
So you two are getting
pretty hot and heavy, huh?

14:25.564 --> 14:27.828
When was the last time you saw her?

14:29.068 --> 14:31.502
- Why?
- I'm just making conversation.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.605
No one else in this house likes me.
At least I can talk to you.

14:34.773 --> 14:39.767
- Especially if you need someone to talk to.
- Oh, please, I'm eating.

14:43.282 --> 14:46.615
So seriously,
how well do you know Anna?

14:46.785 --> 14:48.685
I know Anna extremely well.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.287
Uh-huh.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.787
Well, know that you can talk to me
about anything.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.426
I'm here to answer any questions
that you have...

14:55.594 --> 14:57.186
...to help you in any way I can.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.089
Why?

15:00.266 --> 15:01.893
Because your dad would want me to.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.031
I'm, uh... I'm good.

15:14.446 --> 15:18.280
Uh-oh, Cherie. You won again.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.816
Hope I'm wearing my good underwear.

15:21.887 --> 15:25.050
Tonight's just one blast from the past
after another.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.385
- No, no, no.
- Mm.

15:31.463 --> 15:32.896
Mm.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.626
It's good to see you, Isobel.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.394
Just having fun
with your naughty little minion.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.968
Mm.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.572
How'd you find me?

15:41.740 --> 15:45.301
I searched all the bank-owned foreclosures
and found the most expensive one.

15:45.477 --> 15:49.140
Oh, I should have known.
You were the one that taught me that.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.179
- Mm-hm.
- What are you really doing here?

15:51.350 --> 15:52.783
You caused quite a stir.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.479
You blew into town, saw everyone
except for the man who made you.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.987
- I'm a little hurt.
- I'm so sorry.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.319
Did you bring the device?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.055
- Ow.
- Heh, heh.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.464
- What are you doing with John Gilbert?
- We dated when we were young.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.631
- He was a little bit in love with me.
- I'm sure, one of the many.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.936
Now, this invention,
what do you want with it?

16:19.111 --> 16:21.136
Oh, me personally?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.339
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what I'm told.

16:24.516 --> 16:27.144
You know, Damon,
we're on the same side.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.083
- Oh, yeah? Which side is that?
- Katherine's.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.723
She wants John Gilbert
to have the device.

16:33.892 --> 16:38.090
I think that you know that she's not happy
when she doesn't get what she wants.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.896
- Why are you doing her dirty work?
- Don't kill the messenger.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.729
We both know
that you can't control Katherine.

16:44.903 --> 16:47.235
- She does what she wants.
- Pfft. And so do I.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.600
- Oh, really, Damon?
- Yeah.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.901
You do?

16:53.379 --> 16:55.404
What should we do now?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.813
Oh, yeah.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.422
Memory serves.

17:15.634 --> 17:18.364
Now that I have your attention, listen up.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.233
You do not come into my town,
threaten people I care about.

17:21.406 --> 17:25.741
Going after Elena? Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.038
Because I do believe
in killing the messenger.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.147
You know why?

17:30.282 --> 17:32.045
Because it sends a message.

17:35.154 --> 17:38.920
If Katherine wants something from me,
you tell that bitch to come get it herself.

18:00.312 --> 18:03.213
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.107
I couldn't sleep last night.

18:06.285 --> 18:10.483
You were obviously upset about something,
and I just walked away.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.452
That's not me.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.285
That can't be us.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.288
You're my friend, Elena.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.432
If you need me, I'm here for you.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.267
And I'm sorry
I couldn't show you that yesterday.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.471
I met my birth mother.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.444
Oh.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.438
Was it?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.309
Are you okay?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.233
Hey, man.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.926
Yeah?

18:58.670 --> 19:02.436
So Caroline tells me you've been
on your own the past two weeks.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.337
Is everything okay?

19:04.510 --> 19:07.308
You're asking me about my mom?
Seriously?

19:07.479 --> 19:10.141
Why don't I have her give you a call
when she blows through?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.680
Dude.

19:12.017 --> 19:16.181
That's not what I meant, okay?
I'm just trying to...

19:18.157 --> 19:19.784
- I don't know what to say.
- Good.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.620
Don't say anything, because you're a dick,
end of story.

19:22.794 --> 19:23.818
I know.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.154
Yeah, whatever.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.070
Hey, thanks for meeting me.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.903
- I wanted you to see this.
- Is that Emily's spell book?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.780
I've been going through it
since Grams died.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.210
Check this out.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.583
- That's the vampire compass.
- Yeah.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.884
According to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert
never succeeded in inventing anything.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.222
Emily secretly spelled them all
with magic.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.488
Compass.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.799
Rings.

20:04.803 --> 20:08.068
The mystery device you told me about.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.798
Yeah, that's it.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.206
Well, part of it.
Damon only has the one piece.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.710
Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.816
But she couldn't stand by
and watch innocent people get killed.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.317
This was the only way
she could think of to help...

20:21.453 --> 20:24.889
...to let Johnathan Gilbert believe
he'd actually invented these devices.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.621
Does it say what it does?

20:34.900 --> 20:38.461
- Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Why?

20:40.038 --> 20:41.198
This is a weapon.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.875
Against vampires.

20:53.952 --> 20:55.613
Elena.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.220
Hey. Um...

20:57.389 --> 20:59.380
Have you seen Stefan? I need to find him.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.958
No, not lately.
Listen, do you have a second?

21:02.861 --> 21:05.227
- Yeah, what's up? What's going on?
- Well, it's Anna.

21:05.397 --> 21:08.730
I've left her all these messages
and she hasn't gotten back to me.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.562
- Not even a text.
- Anna?

21:11.737 --> 21:14.001
I didn't know
that you guys were still friends.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.639
Yeah, we're more than friends.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.072
Look, something
could be seriously wrong.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.370
And if you know anything,
you gotta tell me.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.077
I haven't talked to her, Jer.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.080
Are you lying to me right now?

21:26.251 --> 21:28.742
- Why would you say that?
- That's what you do. You lie.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.410
You lie about everything.

21:30.822 --> 21:34.189
I know what Anna is,
and I know that you know.

21:34.393 --> 21:37.920
So tell me,
do you have any idea where she is?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.131
No.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.295
But, Jer... Jeremy, wait.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.498
Jeremy.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.506
Isobel.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.414
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your mother, Elena.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.110
I wanna be more involved in your life.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.855
- I don't want you in my life.
- I understand that.

22:05.023 --> 22:07.150
You already have a lot of people
you care about.

22:07.459 --> 22:11.520
But I've been studying.
Let's see if I got this right.

22:11.697 --> 22:17.499
There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie.
Gonna stay away from that one.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.369
The sad little brother, Jeremy.

22:22.641 --> 22:25.804
And there's Caroline. Obnoxious Caroline.

22:25.977 --> 22:27.945
I got all of my info from her, by the way.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.174
She had no idea who I was,
and she wouldn't stop yapping.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.674
Aww.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.251
And there's Matt.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.746
Friend, ex, Yappy's future ex.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.151
Lots of connections there.

22:40.325 --> 22:43.260
- Matt's not involved in this.
- He's involved with you, isn't he?

22:43.462 --> 22:46.590
Look, you shouldn't be here.
You need to leave.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.063
No. I have some friends here too.

22:49.234 --> 22:53.330
Look. See that man over there,
standing next to Matt by the float?

22:53.505 --> 22:56.770
His name's Frank. He's very handsome.

22:56.975 --> 22:58.670
And he's also quite handy.

22:58.844 --> 23:02.473
And he noticed that the axle
is kind of rusted, which is very dangerous.

23:02.614 --> 23:07.847
So all you have to do
is apply a little bit of pressure and...

23:08.019 --> 23:09.111
No!

23:10.922 --> 23:13.755
- Hey, pick this trailer up! Guys, lift it!
- Give me a hand.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.689
- Dude, come on.
- Come on, lift.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.362
Come on!

23:23.602 --> 23:26.298
- Caroline, call an ambulance.
- Okay.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.929
Why are you doing this?

23:28.106 --> 23:30.267
I'm showing you how easy it is
to hurt people.

23:30.609 --> 23:33.578
You're doing this just because
of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?

23:33.745 --> 23:36.942
- Hand it over and the fun will stop.
- Damon's not gonna give it to me.

23:37.115 --> 23:40.243
And I think that you underestimate
how much Damon cares about you.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.319
He'll kill you before he gives it up.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.786
Is that before or after I kill your brother,
Jeremy?

23:46.958 --> 23:48.619
Jeremy?

23:49.728 --> 23:51.127
Jeremy!

23:56.535 --> 23:58.526
The ambulance is saying
15 to 20 minutes.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.036
- I can take him.
- Caroline can take me.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.834
- No, I didn't drive.
- Then I'll wait.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.441
You will not wait.
Okay, you need to see a doctor.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.669
- Tyler's driving. End of story.
- Fine.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.971
- Go.
- I'll bring my car around.

24:18.323 --> 24:21.815
- I see you're packing. That's a good sign.
- It won't be long now.

24:22.294 --> 24:26.128
- Did you get the missing piece? Where is it?
- I don't have it yet.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.459
Then why did you call me here?

24:28.633 --> 24:31.261
Because I have the next best thing.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.196
No, sit down.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.139
- What the hell are you doing?
- Getting what I want.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.278
Yeah, but he's my nephew...

24:40.445 --> 24:42.879
...and you're gonna let him go
right this second.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.641
That gaudy ring on your finger?
It comes off.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.580
Come on.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.346
Come on, Isobel. I know you.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.347
Okay? It's me, John. You can't hurt a kid.

24:53.525 --> 24:57.518
- I'll kill him to prove you wrong.
- Really? Are you that far gone?

24:58.230 --> 25:01.393
Look, I know you've changed, okay?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.795
But the old Isobel
is in there somewhere still.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.294
Isn't she?

25:07.405 --> 25:08.736
Come on, let him go.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.467
Okay.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.547
- Unh!
- John!

25:26.858 --> 25:28.155
Okay.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.886
Nice try.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.665
We'll see how you do without this.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.937
Where's the device?

25:46.144 --> 25:49.204
Damon has it.
He's gonna be difficult to reason with.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.941
Then we'll go to him. I'll talk to him.

25:52.384 --> 25:56.445
He's not just gonna hand it over,
especially if it's harmful to vampires.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.081
What if it's not?

26:03.929 --> 26:06.090
- Absolutely not.
- Hear me out.

26:06.264 --> 26:10.098
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel
so she can give it to John, who'll kill me.

26:10.268 --> 26:13.101
- I like being a living dead person.
- But it'll be useless.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.796
- Bonnie can take its power away.
- I don't trust her.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.602
I can remove the original spell.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.042
- John and Isobel will never know.
- No. No, I'll get Jeremy my own way.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.113
Really? How are you gonna do that? Hm?

26:24.282 --> 26:25.806
Because Isobel is a vampire...

26:25.984 --> 26:28.748
...and Jeremy could be dead
the second you walk in the door.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.889
Are you even up for this?
I mean, no offense.

26:33.058 --> 26:36.118
You're no Emily Bennett.
Emily knew what she was doing.

26:36.294 --> 26:39.058
- I've been practicing.
- It's not piano lessons, honey.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.430
What's your favorite book?

26:42.601 --> 26:45.297
- What?
- Name a book. Any book.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.195
Name a book.

26:48.707 --> 26:52.404
How about Call of the Wild,
Jack London?

27:02.654 --> 27:04.349
Jack London.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.088
- Great parlor trick.
- We're doing this, Damon.

27:08.259 --> 27:11.422
And we're gonna do it my way.
Now give me the device.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.228
We're wasting time.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.867
I don't trust you. I tried to kill you.

27:18.269 --> 27:22.672
- Mm. You're right. You can't trust me.
- But you can trust me.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.819
Thank you.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.403
Here you go.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.165
Thank you.

27:58.209 --> 27:59.767
What is she after?

28:03.048 --> 28:06.313
Your ancestor invented a weapon.

28:06.484 --> 28:09.214
A device that's extremely harmful
to vampires.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.652
- We've been trying to get it.
- Why?

28:12.824 --> 28:16.590
Because there's a group of vampires
from a long time ago...

28:16.795 --> 28:19.059
...that wants revenge on this town.

28:20.665 --> 28:25.102
But why would a vampire
help you kill other vampires? Lt...

28:25.303 --> 28:27.931
She has her own reasons
for wanting them dead.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.733
Look, Jeremy...

28:29.908 --> 28:32.570
...no one ever thought vampires
would return to this town.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.507
Not in modern times.

28:34.679 --> 28:36.306
But they have.

28:36.448 --> 28:40.043
- And we have to destroy them.
- All of them? No.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.619
- There are some good ones out there.
- There's no such thing.

28:44.923 --> 28:48.723
- I don't believe that.
- Well, your dad did.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.593
And as his son,
that should mean something to you.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.862
How did my father know about all this?

28:55.867 --> 28:58.427
Who do you think taught me
about the family history?

29:38.943 --> 29:40.467
Done.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.311
- Great. Now what?
- Now we give it to Isobel.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.774
Where's the device?

30:15.947 --> 30:18.541
- Where's my brother?
- This isn't a negotiation.

30:18.716 --> 30:19.808
Where's the invention?

30:21.219 --> 30:24.814
- Where's my brother?
- Do you really think that I came alone?

30:28.626 --> 30:30.685
Do you really think that I came alone?

30:38.169 --> 30:39.636
For God's sakes. Call home.

30:40.538 --> 30:42.028
- What?
- Call home.

30:42.207 --> 30:44.471
Ask to speak to your brother, Jeremy.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.973
- Hello?
- Jeremy. Are you okay?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.681
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Uncle John hit his head.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.087
- It was an accident.
- And we're all laughing.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.824
- Yeah, but I'm okay.
- I'll be home soon, all right?

31:07.532 --> 31:08.556
Yeah.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.577
- You were never gonna hurt him.
- No, I was gonna kill him.

31:24.048 --> 31:27.882
Don't look for any redeeming qualities
in me.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.212
I don't have any.

31:29.387 --> 31:33.084
But you took a risk with Damon. How did
you know he was gonna give it to me?

31:33.258 --> 31:34.691
Because he's in love with you.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.498
Thank you.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.267
For what?

31:54.045 --> 31:56.411
For being such a monumental
disappointment.

31:58.082 --> 32:01.518
It keeps the memory of my real mother
perfectly intact.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.086
Goodbye, Elena.

32:05.390 --> 32:09.827
As long as you have a Salvatore
on each arm, you're doomed.

32:12.130 --> 32:15.156
Katherine was smart. She got out.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.134
But we all know
that you're not Katherine.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.982
Hey.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.686
It's okay.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.307
Hey, it's Anna. Leave a message.

33:07.819 --> 33:12.085
- Jeremy, we have to talk about this.
- No, we really don't.

33:12.890 --> 33:17.657
I don't know what Anna told you,
but there are things that you need to know.

33:17.829 --> 33:22.391
Yeah? Because I'm pretty sure
that your journal covered it.

33:24.635 --> 33:25.659
You read my journal?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.862
Save me the speech
about invasion of privacy.

33:28.039 --> 33:31.634
I read a section about Damon erasing
my memory about what happened to Vicki.

33:31.809 --> 33:35.040
Jeremy, please, you don't understand.

33:35.713 --> 33:40.173
The night that Vicki died,
it was like Mom and Dad died all over again.

33:40.685 --> 33:44.678
It was all over your face.
And it hurt so much to see you like that.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.552
I just wanted to take away your pain.
I'm so sorry. L...

33:47.725 --> 33:48.987
Just get out.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.718
- No, Jeremy, let's just...
- Elena.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.859
Just get out.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.057
Please.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.906
Jer, l...

34:32.969 --> 34:34.733
What do you want?

34:34.906 --> 34:37.373
I totally get it.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.972
You here as a history teacher.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.204
- It's good.
- What the hell are you doing?

34:43.380 --> 34:46.578
You act like you don't care,
and yet here you are hunting me down.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.317
I'm leaving.

34:53.491 --> 34:54.958
I just thought I'd say goodbye.

34:55.126 --> 34:58.926
You couldn't be bothered the first time,
so why now?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.691
- You hate me. Good.
- Does that make it easier for you?

35:02.733 --> 35:04.325
What is the point of this exercise?

35:04.502 --> 35:07.699
What did you expect? You spent
all this time trying to track me down.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.434
- What did you think you would find?
- The woman who gave me this.

35:12.076 --> 35:16.240
You act like you don't care, but you cared
enough to protect me after you left.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.442
I was a different person back then.

35:18.916 --> 35:21.316
Right, right, right,
and that person is gone.

35:21.486 --> 35:25.582
The woman I married, the woman I loved,
she's just... She's gone.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.859
You expect me to believe that?

35:35.466 --> 35:38.128
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm ring-free.

35:38.302 --> 35:43.467
I'm vervain-free.
So either kill me or compel me, because...

35:44.475 --> 35:45.499
...I don't believe it.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.606
Not for a second.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.484
I wanted this.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.983
I needed this.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.449
And I'm gonna regret it forever.

36:04.629 --> 36:07.291
This was my mistake.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.160
Not yours.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.807
You're not gonna remember this.

36:18.543 --> 36:19.874
I loved you.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.371
I did.

36:22.547 --> 36:26.039
And when I think about what I gave up,
it hurts.

36:26.217 --> 36:31.314
But now your heart's free of me.
It's easier this way.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.052
Goodbye, Ric.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.857
Anna? Hey, what are you doing here?

37:18.936 --> 37:20.096
My mother.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.734
She's dead.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.333
What?

37:28.646 --> 37:30.136
She was killed.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.139
Oh, my God, Anna.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.981
I'm so sorry.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.790
I know I'm not supposed to be here,
but I don't have anywhere else to go.

37:46.497 --> 37:47.555
It's okay.

37:56.874 --> 37:58.739
Would you like one?

38:00.678 --> 38:05.411
Say it, whatever it is. Purge. Get it out.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.014
- It's about what Isobel said.
- What about it?

38:10.021 --> 38:11.955
Well, I know that you and Elena bonded.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.889
And I know that she cares about you
and I know you care about her.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.928
Well, this is going
in an interesting direction.

38:20.531 --> 38:24.126
I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt.
She considers you a friend.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.970
Same here. Elena is a very good friend.

38:27.138 --> 38:31.472
Actually, she might qualify
as my only friend.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.405
Is that a problem?

38:33.544 --> 38:36.342
So at the risk of sounding like a, um...

38:36.514 --> 38:40.143
- Like a jealous boyfriend...
- Oh, there's no risk. You do.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.978
History will not be repeating itself
where Elena's concerned.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.316
Do you understand what I'm saying?

38:50.461 --> 38:52.019
Sure.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.663
Sure.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.999
Do you understand?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.433
Whatever you say, man.
I mean, honestly, we're just friends.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.473
And I wasn't looking forward
to telling her the truth anyway.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.542
So I'll let you do it.

39:08.446 --> 39:11.006
- What truth?
- About John.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.878
I know you guys don't like to keep secrets
from each other.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.085
- What are you talking about?
- Am I the only one...

39:17.254 --> 39:20.087
...who has the ability
to put two and two together? Isobel.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.020
Hello?

39:23.027 --> 39:25.086
She dated John when she was 15.

39:25.262 --> 39:29.198
She gets pregnant and ends up
at the doctor's office of John's brother.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.164
Now, what do you think John's role is?

39:31.335 --> 39:35.169
I mean, go ahead, think about it. I'll wait.
Did you get it? You there yet? Hm?

39:35.973 --> 39:41.502
- So you think that John is Elena's father?
- Ding-ding-ding-ding!

39:42.980 --> 39:44.743
- What proof do you have?
- I don't need any.

39:44.915 --> 39:48.009
That's a DNA test for John and Elena
and Maury Povich to deal with.

39:48.185 --> 39:51.746
But I know how well
you deal with these big bombshells, so...

39:51.922 --> 39:53.719
Sleep tight.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.091
Oh, and when you do tell Elena...

39:57.261 --> 40:00.594
...and she needs a friend to talk to
about anything...

40:00.798 --> 40:02.766
...l'm here for her.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.747
- Hello?
- On your doorstep...

40:17.915 --> 40:21.373
...you'll find what you've been looking for.
- And my ring?

40:21.552 --> 40:25.147
Don't screw this up.
You know what you have to do, John.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.424
I got it. I won't fail.

40:34.899 --> 40:36.730
You better not.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.734
Katherine wants
all of those tomb vampires dead.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.634
And I wanna add two more to that list.

40:44.542 --> 40:47.534
- Let me guess.
- Stefan and Damon.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.236
I don't want this life for her.

40:49.413 --> 40:52.644
Well, that was always part of the plan.
Consider them gone.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.614
She's our daughter, John.
We owe that to her.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.647
I know.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.294
So you're not gonna tell me
what happened?

41:18.008 --> 41:21.068
I did something bad, Caroline.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.112
And I lied about it.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.172
To who?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.443
To Elena.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.612
I pretended to do something...

41:32.790 --> 41:34.382
...I didn't really do.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.088
What are you talking about?

41:38.462 --> 41:42.330
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.469
Grams would have never done it,
so I couldn't either.

41:47.471 --> 41:49.962
But when Elena finds out...

41:50.875 --> 41:53.503
...she's never gonna forgive me.
