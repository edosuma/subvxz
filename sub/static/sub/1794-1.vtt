I'm sorry, sir, but I...

my fucking questions,

04:44.250 --> 04:45.890

keep going straight and the
Maypole is on your right.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.557

- The Maypole.
- 'That's been shut for ages.'

Yeah, I can see that now, mate.

09:34.416 --> 09:37.932
- They wanna stare a bit more, don't they?
- All right, don't worry about it.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.640
(BARMAID) Yes, gents?

you and I have for a while.

Hello, Mickey.

10:45.958 --> 10:47.890
Didn't fancy a night
at the Maypole then?

10:47.916 --> 10:52.807
- Nah, it's not really my scene.
- I'd have swerved it too, if I'd known.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.849
You shouldn't trust
everyone that you meet.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.765

judge of character.

you're thinking with.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.765
Who cares.

12:11.791 --> 12:14.099
We've got a heavy day tomorrow.

good as the training it delivers.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.932
Those of you here
for the first time

13:51.958 --> 13:54.765
who think you have an idea of
what you're about to go through...

13:54.791 --> 13:56.765
you don't.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.515
Just ask anyone here who is on
their second and final attempt.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.974
You will decide who passes
this course, not us.

14:09.791 --> 14:12.849
All we do is lay out each phase
of selection in front of you,

14:12.875 --> 14:16.349
and after that it's
really very, very simple.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.140
All you have to do is complete it,

14:22.166 --> 14:24.057
and if you don't...

14:25.166 --> 14:27.099
you're binned.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.849
Follow me.

14:46.625 --> 14:50.890
You will be smashed, both
physically and mentally.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.099
And when you believe you're at
breaking point, there will be more.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.890
You'll start to wonder why
you decided to do this,

15:16.916 --> 15:18.849
and most of you will
choose to leave.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.890

hard for the fun of it.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.140
It's about changing
your perception.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.724
Training your body and
mind to become elite,

15:38.750 --> 15:43.265
and make no mistake... the S.A.S. is the
most elite fighting force in the world.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.474

16:14.958 --> 16:16.765
So what about you, Mickey?

16:17.750 --> 16:19.807
I'm a chef in the RLC.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.932
(LAUGHING)

16:21.958 --> 16:25.224
Fuck off! What reg you really in?

16:27.083 --> 16:29.974
I'm in the Royal Logistics Core...

16:30.000 --> 16:31.599
and I'm a chef.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.890
Fuckin' hell, mate.

16:33.916 --> 16:37.682
The cake baking course
ain't for another month.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.682
Geezer's only a
fucking slop jockey.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.307
(LAUGHTER)

16:55.000 --> 16:57.432
(CARTER) Tabbing with weight
is what we're experts in.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.307
This is so we have the
strength and ability

17:01.333 --> 17:04.432
to carry our kit and survive over
tough terrain and long distances,

17:04.458 --> 17:06.682
even when behind enemy lines.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.890
You will start off light.

17:11.915 --> 17:13.557
That's good.

17:17.540 --> 17:21.182
This is so we build your base
fitness up to a decent level.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.182
(HOLLOWAY) Come on, let's go!

17:24.208 --> 17:26.848
(CARTER) You will need all the
muscular endurance you have,

17:26.875 --> 17:28.515
to complete the
missions we undertake.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.599
(HOLLOWAY) Where's the fight?
Come on, Jackson, get him down,

17:30.625 --> 17:33.040
you're in fucking 2 PARA now,
you'll get us in fucking shit.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.515
(JJ) Go, go!

17:34.541 --> 17:36.265
(HOLLOWAY)
Get off your fucking chest!

17:38.375 --> 17:41.765
(CARTER) At this point will we
increase the weight you carry.

fitness up to a decent level.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.349

pain you're willing to take.

(BUZZING)

18:29.875 --> 18:34.390
Troopers use close quarter fighting
a lot more than one might think.

18:34.416 --> 18:36.099
This could be a stealth operation

18:36.125 --> 18:39.099
where you are required to
kill in complete silence.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.474
You could have run out of ammunition,
or maybe your just evading capture.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.765
Chris, step up.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.390
Take me down, any way you can.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.140
(GROANS)

19:02.166 --> 19:03.849
(CARTER) Whatever the situation...

19:03.875 --> 19:07.474
knowing how to disarm and take out
an opponent without a firearm,

19:07.500 --> 19:09.307
is not only a lifesaver,

19:09.333 --> 19:12.140
but it's an expertise required
by the Special Forces.

(GROANS)

19:19.333 --> 19:20.807
(GRUNTS)

19:24.666 --> 19:29.765
The Israeli special forces invented a
fighting technique called Krav Maga.

19:29.791 --> 19:34.682
It's the best offensive and defensive close
quarter fighting method ever developed.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.015
This is what we use.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.474

get your fucking legs in.

19:46.541 --> 19:48.724

19:57.625 --> 19:58.724
Now you.

19:58.750 --> 20:03.140
If you want to pass this fucking selection,
then you need to work fucking hard.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.390
Get on those bars!

20:05.416 --> 20:06.932
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

- Yep.

Thank you.

Have you got any brufen?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.349
No.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.224

59:49.083 --> 59:51.182
Give us a hand, will ya?

59:54.000 --> 59:55.807
You all right?

59:55.833 --> 59:57.349
Yeah?

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:16.224
- They look ruined.
- Good.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.724
Dawn.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.765
You did it then.

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:39.057
Yeah, I think so.

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.640
Keep up the good work.

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:46.640
Was that a bit of
encouragement ma'am? No?

01:00:46.666 --> 01:00:49.182
- Call it recognition.
- OK.

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:50.974
Well, then I...

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:55.140
I guess a drink's out
of the question.

01:00:55.166 --> 01:00:57.390
You're not there yet, Mickey.

01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:48.224
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:12.265
Fuckin' hell, mate.

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:14.307
After going through all that.

01:02:14.333 --> 01:02:16.349
Your face either fits...

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:21.474
(MAJOR) Mickey!

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.390
or it doesn't.

01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:33.765
Oi. Good luck, mate.

01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:54.432
Take a seat.

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:00.890
Thank you, sir.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.474
Soldier's fail when they come here.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.765
Either their mind, body or
attitude let's them down,

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.265
and if they're wired wrong,

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.682
then there is still no place
for them in this regiment.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:25.349
We are active in the most
hostile places in the world.

01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:28.682
We are on covert and overt missions

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:32.057
in places members of the public
don't have a clue about.

01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:35.974
Those who pass selection have
the tools to join the regiment,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.932
and fight alongside the elite.

01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:42.932
We are single minded in a
professionalism and ability to succeed,

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.765
whatever the odds.

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:49.015
And we live and die by a motto...
"Who dares wins."

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:53.974
But it doesn't end there.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.224
You might not like the regiment
and we may not like you.

01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:03.140
However, there's only
one way to find out.

01:04:09.666 --> 01:04:12.349
Well? Do you wanna give it a go?

01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:17.140
I'd be honoured, sir.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:23.557
You should be extremely proud of
yourself for passing this, Mickey.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:29.265
I wish you well with your career,

01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:31.349
and long may you serve with us.

01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:33.807
Well done!

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.474

Names of all the S.A.S. that
have been killed in action...

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:09.765
are inscribed on this clock.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.724
My dad retired from the regiment
without his name being added.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.724
He beat the clock.

01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:35.682

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.932
Well done, lad.

- Oh, JJ.

You're going to need to
man up a bit, aren't ya?

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.265
Thank you.

01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:56.599
It's all right, you can
get the next round then.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.307
I don't mean that.

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:03.640
I don't think I was going to do it.

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:06.849
Oh, you were.

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:08.849
I just couldn't be
bothered to wait.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.557
Still, I... I appreciate it.

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.724
Well, you did good.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.224
I mean seriously good.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.724
You're one of the best, I've
seen come through this course.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.974
Even for a guy who
doesn't like to jump?

01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:34.140
Yeah, well, you know,
you'll get used to it...

01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:38.807
again.

01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:45.307
If I'm being 100 percent honest
I'd have you on my team anytime.

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:46.765
That means a lot.

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:49.890
- Good, cos you are.
- You what?

01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:53.390
I'm heading back up to Hereford to
head up the special projects team.

01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:55.557

You're on it.

I... I don't know what to say.

01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:02.682
Well, don't get too
excited just yet.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:06.432
- You can't put a price on experience.
- Right, yeah.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.182
Of course.

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.224
My orders were to have
some probationers,

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:15.182
which basically means, you have 12
months to fit inside the regiment,

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:17.724
if you don't, it's goodbye.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.057

I've been working with MI5

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.182
to monitor the activities
of a small group

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:02.099
of white-skinned Bosnian
Muslim extremists.

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:04.015

Al-Qaida have recruited

from among the Bosnian

been working with us

that this group has assembled a
warehouse location here in town
