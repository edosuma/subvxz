01:26.880 --> 01:31.440
Welcome to the
oven, aka Camp Carolina:

01:31.440 --> 01:34.320
our home away from home
in this godforsaken country.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.960
What I can't convey,
via this video journal

01:39.960 --> 01:43.440
is the incredible heat
and the local smells.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.640
Oh, my God, it stinks.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.520
Yo, Mustangs!
Yo!

01:48.520 --> 01:50.560
On 3, give me a smile!

01:50.560 --> 01:53.280
1, 2, 3!

01:55.480 --> 01:58.840
But let me introduce myself.
My name is Angel Salazar.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.120
Private Salazar.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.440
I'm that poor Latino filmmaker

02:01.440 --> 02:02.840
that did not get into USC.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.360
Hey! Papi Chulo, what's
goin' on over here, man?

02:05.360 --> 02:07.600
<i>Ai! Qu√© chulo!
Enter McCoy.</i>

02:07.600 --> 02:09.080
<i>Hace calor!</i>

02:09.080 --> 02:11.560
I'm tryin' to make a video.
Oh, yeah? Tryin' to make--

02:11.560 --> 02:13.200
You know what just happened
to your video? Yeah?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.840
Just got a whole hell of a
lot sexier, baby.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.600
Yes, it did. Sexy is here.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.520
Making a video of me
making a video of you.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.760
Yeah, yeah. You're making a
video of me making a video of you.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.400
Uh-huh. Why is that?
Getting it all down

02:23.400 --> 02:25.440
because this might be the last
video that either of us makes.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.920
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.480
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's make a deal, then.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.840
You and me. Seriously.
All right.

02:30.840 --> 02:35.000
If I die in this war, I want you
to get all my videos, all right?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.080
Okay. And if you die in this war,

02:37.080 --> 02:39.520
I'll get your videos,
your camera,

02:39.520 --> 02:40.800
and your girlfriend's
phone number.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.880
My girlfriend's number?

02:41.880 --> 02:43.080
Yeah, your girlfriend's
phone number.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.240
What's Mrs. McCoy going
to be saying about that?

02:44.240 --> 02:45.520
This is my brother.
Come on, man.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.920
All right, that's a deal.
Who do you think I am?

02:46.920 --> 02:49.320
That's a deal. You know
what I like about you, Sally?

02:49.320 --> 02:51.760
Yeah?
Besides absolutely nothing?

02:51.760 --> 02:56.120
Absolutely nothing. And your
sweet and sunny disposition.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.320
No, no, no. It's not about
sunny disposition, McCoy.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.840
It's about
telling it how it is.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.200
Oh, is that what it's about?

03:02.200 --> 03:03.520
It's about telling it
how it is.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.360
You want to hear telling it--
Hey, hey! Hey!

03:05.360 --> 03:07.400
Over here, over here.
Please.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.040
Focus on what's beautiful.
Thank you.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.920
Do you want to hear me
telling it how it is?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.880
Y'all want to hear
telling it how it is?

03:13.880 --> 03:15.880
What do you all think's
gonna be the first casualty

03:15.880 --> 03:17.400
of this entire conflict, huh?
You.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.480
That's right!

03:19.480 --> 03:21.400
It's not going to be
Rush or Flake

03:21.400 --> 03:24.040
or "Don't ask, don't tell"
over here.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.400
You know what it's gonna be?
What?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.880
Do you know what it's
going to be? Talk to me!

03:26.880 --> 03:28.360
You know what it's gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

03:28.360 --> 03:30.520
It's gonna be the truth.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.360
Come on, now. Just
tellin' it like it is.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.000
You suck! What are you talking about?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.680
Ah, here endeth the lesson.

03:36.680 --> 03:41.000
That was some sad,
depressing stuff right there.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.920
All right, let me finish.
Let me finish.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.440
All right. So I joined up
to get the money for college,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.120
and a better chance
at film school. Yeah.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.240
I mean, I'm going to be a combat
vet, for chrissakes, right?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.520
And with this awesome war film
in hand, they got to take me.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.960
Oh, yeah.
So while I'm over here,

03:53.960 --> 03:55.920
I'm gonna be shootin'
whatev--

03:55.920 --> 03:58.440
...whatever the fuck goes on.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.040
Which so far-- Get--

04:00.040 --> 04:02.600
Which so far
is basically nothing.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.560
Now, our squad mans
a checkpoint outside Samarra.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.160
It's all day long
in the boiling hot sun,

04:08.160 --> 04:09.760
wearing 120 pounds of gear,

04:09.760 --> 04:12.640
checking out cars for
weapons and bombs and shit?

04:12.640 --> 04:15.480
This deployment is
unspeakably underwhelming.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.120
The only insurgent
we found so far

04:17.120 --> 04:19.519
is one big fuckin' rat we
chased out of here last night.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.600
Oh, that rat died.
So, get-- Get off.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.080
'Cause I fucked it
to death.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.840
So don't be expecting
any Hollywood action flick.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.360
It's not going
to be smash cuts,

04:26.360 --> 04:28.240
no adrenaline-pumping
soundtrack,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.680
no logical narrative to
help you make sense of it.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.560
Basically, here,
shit happens.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.000
You want soda?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.200
No. No.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.880
I scored some
for one M.R.E.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.520
Just go.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.320
Go on. Get out
of here. Go on.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.360
Jesus.
He doesn't let up.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.480
As you
see, we set up road signs.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.680
They're vividly colored,
highly visible,

09:13.680 --> 09:15.200
and impossible to miss.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.240
They're written
in English and Arabic,

09:17.240 --> 09:18.920
and they inform
every single driver

09:18.920 --> 09:21.680
that they're entering
a checkpoint.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.400
Get out of the car.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.320
Come up over here.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.600
Quickly.
Let's go, people.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.040
Go, quick!

11:20.040 --> 11:21.240
Get in line here.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.160
Right there.
That's it, that's it.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.560
Let's go, people.
Yell out.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.640
Arms up.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.760
Arms down. Tell him
to open the trunk.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.640
Open the trunk.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.560
Let's go, people.
Come on.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.120
Come on, move.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.040
Don't go in. It's open, it's
open. Take your hands out of there.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.560
Is he afraid of the dog?
Afraid of the dog?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.360
Who gives a fuck?
Fuck him.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.600
Come over here.
Come over here.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.080
Come on, stay in line.
Eyes front.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.280
Sally?
All right, Blix.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.120
The car is yours.
Good. Come here.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.560
Come back, come back here.
In there. In there.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.200
In there. Okay.
Up here, up here.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.600
In. In. In, in, in.
In. In, in, in, boy.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.600
Come on. I need you
in there. In there.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.680
Come on, boy. Wait.
Up here. Up here.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.800
In there. In there. Up
here. Up here. Come on.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.520
Good boy, Kevin.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.400
Good boy, Kevin.
Good boy.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.600
All right, come here.
Back through here.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.960
It's all clear. All right.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.200
Tell them they can go in
the car and drive off slowly.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.920
That's Gabe
Blix. He's from Virginia.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.840
He doesn't talk a lot 'cause he's
got his nose in a book all the time.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.720
Yo, Gabe, what you
readin' over there?

13:53.720 --> 13:55.400
I'm reading a book,
Salazar.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.240
All right.
What's it about?

13:57.240 --> 14:00.160
It's about-- Dude, no,
seriously. What are you doing?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.520
What are you doing right
now? Who are you? I'm--

14:02.520 --> 14:04.200
I want to get your opinion.
Okay, if you have that camera,

14:04.200 --> 14:07.080
then you're part of the media,
and we're under strict orders

14:07.080 --> 14:09.440
not to speak with you, yeah?
Don't call me media, asshole!

14:09.440 --> 14:11.440
Come on, just tell me what
you're reading. Tell me about it.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.960
Dude, no. You're gonna make some, kinda
like commie rendition of our mission--

14:13.960 --> 14:16.920
Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
This is about the truth, bro.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.480
This is about what's going
down. This is the truth 24/7.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.760
This camera, it never
lies. Yeah, the--

14:22.760 --> 14:24.680
Dude, that is bullshit.
Okay?

14:24.680 --> 14:25.840
'Cause that's all
that camera ever does.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.520
Just show me
the title of the book.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.960
"Appoin--" Really?
All right. So, you know,

14:31.960 --> 14:35.160
what's it got to say
about Samarra? Nothing.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.680
Nothing.
No, nothing.

14:36.680 --> 14:40.040
It's about this, like, guy,
he's this country club guy,

14:40.040 --> 14:42.280
and he gets really drunk
on Christmas Eve,

14:42.280 --> 14:47.160
and he throws his drink
in his boss' face.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.120
And everybody in the whole
city that he lives in,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.720
like right outside
of Philadelphia--

14:50.720 --> 14:53.160
Okay, but what's it
got to do with Samarra?

14:53.160 --> 14:56.280
It-- Nothing. The opening
makes reference to Samarra,

14:56.280 --> 15:00.360
but besides that, you know, it's
just like, classic cover situation

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
What? Don't judge a book by its cover.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.880
Right.
Basically.

15:03.880 --> 15:08.240
All right. So, uh--
Whoa, when's the appointment?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.080
You don't want to know.
I do want to know!

15:10.080 --> 15:11.680
Dude, you don't-- This is about books!
I don't have anything about books.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.920
This is literary.
This is good.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.440
The appointment, uh-- Do you want
me to just read you the introduction?

15:18.440 --> 15:22.280
Perfect. Perfect.
Give me something good.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.640
Okay, let me find it.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.280
The introduction's
actually not by John O'Hara.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.240
It's by W. Somerset Maugham.
Perfect.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.200
And-- You have no idea
who that is, do you?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.320
Not at all.
Didn't think so. Okay.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.800
<i>It's called Death Speaks.
Oh, wait, it's spooky?</i>

15:34.840 --> 15:36.680
All right. Read that
right into the camera. Go.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.640
All right."There was
a merchant in Baghdad,

15:38.640 --> 15:39.920
who sent his servant
to market to buy--"

15:39.920 --> 15:42.080
All right, Gabe, wait.
Before you start reading that,

15:42.080 --> 15:44.880
once you get into it, think
about what you're gonna say,

15:44.880 --> 15:47.000
and then put some like,
you know, some heart behind it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.960
Go!

15:48.960 --> 15:52.280
"There was a merchant in Baghdad
who sent his servant to market

15:52.280 --> 15:54.760
"to buy provisions,
and in a little while,

15:54.760 --> 15:56.720
"the servant came back,
white and trembling,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.040
"and said, 'Master, just now,

15:58.040 --> 15:59.280
when I was
in the marketplace'--"

15:59.280 --> 16:01.000
Yeah, this is a little bit
boring, bro. This is like--

16:01.000 --> 16:04.040
I need to-- Dude, I don't
even want to do this.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.400
Hey!
Yeah.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.680
I got reading, too.

16:12.720 --> 16:17.720
Okay. All right, kid.
I win. Get out of here.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.120
<i>Come on, go.
Emshe, emshe.</i>

16:20.120 --> 16:22.720
Find your
mother. Go find your mother.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.120
No.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.080
<i>I don't need any hajji
slave, all right?</i>

16:26.080 --> 16:27.680
I get you anything.
You want soda?

16:27.680 --> 16:29.480
No. I don't want any
fuckin' soda.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.120
Hey, hey. Sally, Sally!

16:31.120 --> 16:34.440
Ain't you supposed to be saying
"action" on me, or something like that?

16:34.440 --> 16:37.320
All right. Here we go.
I'm Master Sergeant James--

16:37.320 --> 16:38.560
Ohh!

16:38.560 --> 16:41.600
It stands for M.R.E.:
"Meals Refusing to Excrete."

16:41.600 --> 16:44.960
What you doin', Sally?
God damn, man! That's shit.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.200
You're asking for this.
Hey, hey, Sally!

16:47.200 --> 16:49.160
Come on, now.
All right, you ready?

16:49.160 --> 16:52.760
I'm Master Sergeant James
Sweet-- Over here.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.560
Hey.
What's he lookin' at?

16:54.600 --> 16:57.920
Boy! Get out of here. Hey.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Full security. Full security.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.680
<i>Hey, Ishta! Ishta!</i>

17:03.680 --> 17:06.480
Ish-motherfuckin'-ta.
Hey, hey. Hey!

17:06.480 --> 17:09.920
Get over here, Blake.
Oh, oh!

17:09.920 --> 17:12.880
Don't be givin' your
fuckin' food, man. No. No.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.680
<i>Ishta. Ishta.
Go. Go.</i>

17:17.520 --> 17:19.760
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.560
Stay away from anything
and everything

17:21.560 --> 17:23.200
these little midget Ali Babas
give you, all right?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.280
Yo, why not, Master Sergeant?
Why not?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.599
See, my black ass has been over here
for three goddamn tours, all right?

17:27.599 --> 17:30.760
I don't trust
anybody over here. Shit.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.200
How long have you been
over here, Flake?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
Just a couple months.
Just a couple of months.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.720
Shit. Got ourselves
a goddamn virgin here.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.200
Oh!
No, I'm not a virgin

17:39.200 --> 17:40.680
Yeah, all right.
I bet.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.200
And what'd you do before that?
I just hung out, you know?

17:43.200 --> 17:46.080
Fucking around.
Gettin' drunk.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.360
Tried to stay out
of jail.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.800
Sally, come on over here.
Look at this miserable fuck.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.120
This one?
Yeah.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.320
Got him. Probably suckin'
dick for beer money,

17:52.320 --> 17:56.120
if it wasn't for the Army.
Oh.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.400
Look, you're right. I was
suckin' dick for beer money.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.120
This here is the cream of
the Army recruits, right here.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.120
Ouch.
"Cream" is no joke.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.520
You're so goddamn white, boy, you
wouldn't wear yourself after Labor Day.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.240
All right, tell me, Flynny.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.040
Tell me. Like, what was it? You either
had to serve time here or stateside?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.520
Something like that.
Yeah.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.600
Well, you want to get
your ass back in one piece?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.440
I most definitely do.
Well, good.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.320
Stop lookin' to get
yourself killed, then.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.040
You chow down on anything these
little motherfuckin' ragheads give you,

18:20.040 --> 18:22.320
it's like swallowin'
an IED

18:22.320 --> 18:25.080
I wa-- It's a date.
Look at this.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.440
Do you think I want
to eat this?

18:26.440 --> 18:28.400
I wasn't going to eat this.
I was trying to be friendly.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.080
They don't want
to be your friend, slick.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.360
They want to piss on your back and
tell you that it's raining, all right?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.320
Look, trust me. You eat that
shit, and next thing you know,

18:34.320 --> 18:35.880
you gonna be
spittin' up blood.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.720
Hey, look alive,
soldier. All right?

18:37.720 --> 18:40.560
We get back to the house, get yourself
a little kitty kitty, how 'bout that?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.600
Woof-woof!
How can you arrange that?

18:42.600 --> 18:45.280
Look alive, look alive! This right
here is my motherfuckin' Caucasian.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.000
<i>He's mine too!
You're my motherfuckin' ese.</i>

18:47.000 --> 18:49.280
<i>I am your ese?
That's right. Come on.</i>

18:49.280 --> 18:50.520
Yo, Master Sergeant.
What?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.200
We swept by this place
yesterday, right?

18:52.200 --> 18:56.160
Hell, yeah. Bet your ass we're
gonna do it again tomorrow.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.200
Because when
the sun goes down,

18:58.200 --> 19:00.720
<i>these motherfuckin' hajjis
come out their ratholes</i>

19:00.720 --> 19:03.560
and resow their IED's in different
and more surprising places

19:03.560 --> 19:06.080
than the day before,
and you can bet your ass

19:06.080 --> 19:09.680
that these smilin',
soccer-playin' shitbirds

19:09.680 --> 19:12.560
ain't nothin' but
their eyes and ears.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.360
Slow down! Slow down.
Slow it down. Hey! Stop!

20:38.360 --> 20:43.600
Stop the fucking car!
Stop! Stop the goddamn car!

20:43.600 --> 20:47.280
Sally, we got one! Stop!
Stop the god--

20:47.280 --> 20:49.000
Sal!

20:54.080 --> 20:58.760
What the fuck?
Jesus Christ. Holy shit.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.680
Get back!
You got to get back.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.200
<i>Ishta, ishta.</i>

21:40.400 --> 21:42.680
Back 'em up, Sally.
Let's go. Come on.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.520
<i>Ishta, ishta.</i>

21:44.520 --> 21:47.200
Move back from the car!

23:43.480 --> 23:47.520
Say hello to
B.B. Rush and Reno Flake.

23:47.520 --> 23:52.360
Flake is your average grunt, completely
in touch with his primal self,

23:52.360 --> 23:53.840
He's one of our
latest recruits

23:53.840 --> 23:56.800
from way down on the bottom
of the gumbo barrel.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.280
Boy, he discovered
his soul mate: B.B. Rush.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.960
The guy's dumber than
shit, but he's loyal.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.040
Now, they only want
two things here:

24:05.040 --> 24:07.080
to fuck or to fight.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.240
And yesterday, Flake blew
away his first civilian.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.000
Yo, Flake,
what you readin'?

24:15.280 --> 24:17.720
Oh, yeah?
You been gettin' any?

24:17.720 --> 24:20.520
Mm.
No.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.240
All right.
I have.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.600
All right, fine.
Yo, Flake.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.560
<i>How do you feel about
that hajji you smoked?</i>

24:30.560 --> 24:34.200
Well--

24:34.200 --> 24:39.280
All I know is, the only language
these sand niggers understand is force.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.760
And I'm just the cat
to make the introductions.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.040
Fuckin' Roger that, man.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.880
Oh, but the truth be told?
Truth be told, Flake.

24:48.920 --> 24:54.720
Truth be told. Truth is, it wasn't
everything it's cracked up to be.

24:54.720 --> 24:58.960
I mean, I thought my first
kill shot would blow my mind,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.560
but--

25:00.560 --> 25:03.080
It was nothing.
It was like guttin' catfish.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.080
Yo. Sarge, you waved
that guy to stop, right,

25:08.080 --> 25:10.040
<i>that hajji retard?</i>

25:10.040 --> 25:12.960
Oh, yeah. This guy, uh--

25:12.960 --> 25:16.280
Yeah, but the problem is that
most of these fuckin' people,

25:16.280 --> 25:18.360
you know, when you put
your hand up?

25:18.360 --> 25:20.000
They don't know that
that means to stop.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.920
You know, most of these Iraqis
think that you're wavin' hello.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.760
But they fuckin' know what
it means now. All I know is...

25:24.760 --> 25:26.760
these cats screamed
their heads off,

25:26.760 --> 25:28.760
screamed his little,
lady lungs out,

25:28.800 --> 25:32.200
you screamed your beaucoup
brains off-- Ha ha.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.520
And that car just kept comin',
right across that trigger line.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.960
What the fuck else am I
supposed to do but light 'em up?

25:36.960 --> 25:39.240
Light 'em the fuck up.
You did your job.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.320
All right.
But, you know, Flake,

25:41.320 --> 25:43.120
you're not gonna win
many hearts and minds

25:43.120 --> 25:44.640
pumping pregnant women
full of lead, though, right?

25:44.640 --> 25:48.000
That's true, Sally.
Come on. Salazar.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.080
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Get all teary-eyed and say I'm sorry?

25:57.160 --> 26:01.200
"I'm so sorry."

26:06.400 --> 26:09.120
My life's been
changed forever?

26:09.120 --> 26:11.200
My life's been changed
forever, fuck.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.840
<i>Waxing hajjis is like
stomping cockroaches.</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:16.920
I've been there. I've done
that, and it makes me thirsty.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.920
So how about
a nice, cold beer?

26:21.400 --> 26:24.320
God damn!

26:24.320 --> 26:27.160
So Flake--
It's the next fuckin' shipment.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.960
Flake, there's no remorse, now
that you know that she's pregnant?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.600
Now that you know that she had
a child in her womb over there?

26:32.600 --> 26:34.680
Nothin'?

26:37.880 --> 26:39.240
You really have
no remorse.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.960
I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to--

26:40.960 --> 26:42.680
How am I supposed to--
You have no second thoughts.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.240
I have second thoughts.
Let me tell you something:

26:44.240 --> 26:45.920
you have a kid, you have
a wife that's pregnant--

26:45.920 --> 26:48.600
Hold up. Hold up. No, no, no, hold
up. You'll have second thoughts.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.320
You can't afford remorse, okay?

26:51.320 --> 26:52.960
You get remorse, you get weak. I'm
not saying you didn't do a good job.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.840
You get weak, you die.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.200
As simple as that.
He did his fuckin' job.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.880
What are you saying?
You have a kid,

26:58.880 --> 27:01.200
you have a pregnant wife, you
become more of a human being.

27:01.200 --> 27:05.280
If you have a kid, you're gonna be
even more on your fuckin' plan then.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.760
Because you can't afford-- I'm
not saying you're not on your plan.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.560
...not to go home
without diapers.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.400
What the hell
is wrong with you?

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
How do we know that
her-- the fuckin'... Hey!

27:13.400 --> 27:15.440
How do we know if the bun
in her fuckin' oven... Hey!

27:15.440 --> 27:18.920
At ease the shit, all right? Look,
point in fact, he did his job.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.600
Rules of engagement states

27:20.600 --> 27:23.120
if they cross the trigger line,
he kills 'em.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
That's fuckin' right!

27:24.120 --> 27:26.040
Hey! Get the fuck
away from him!

27:26.040 --> 27:28.920
Sarge, how the fuck am I
supposed to see in there? How?

27:28.920 --> 27:30.320
Have a fucking heart.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.560
Get in your fucking rack!
Enough.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.480
Everybody go to bed,
all right?

27:34.480 --> 27:37.200
Does anybody have
a fucking problem with that?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.520
Enough.
Shut the fucking camera off!

27:39.520 --> 27:41.240
All right, all right.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.160
Ten-hut!

27:45.160 --> 27:47.560
Okay, guys. You've all
done a tremendous job,

27:47.560 --> 27:50.120
and I wanna personally thank
each and every one of you.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.960
Colonel Ford, permission
to speak, sir?

27:51.960 --> 27:53.560
Go ahead.
Thank you.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.000
We just wanted to thank you
for your kind words, and, also,

27:56.040 --> 27:58.480
there have been some rumors circulating
about a possible follow-up mission.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.920
No, no, no. I haven't heard
anything about that.

28:00.920 --> 28:05.840
But it does look like we have to keep
up the work here just a little longer.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.800
Longer, sir?
How much longer?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.520
As long as it takes, Private!
That's what you're here for!

28:11.520 --> 28:14.360
Now buck the fuck up!
Yes, sir!

28:15.760 --> 28:17.680
I just got orders.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.680
Second Battalion of 727
is pinned down in Baghdad.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.280
They can't replace us
till someone replaces them.

28:24.280 --> 28:29.200
So half a company will have to
temporarily remain here in Samarra

28:29.200 --> 28:33.760
to man the checkpoints and
keep a lid on insurgent traffic.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.320
<i>You know what it's like? I swear
to God, it's like that Clerks movie.</i>

28:37.320 --> 28:39.760
You know, where the guy
has to work on his day off,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.440
and all kinds
of crazy shit happens,

28:41.440 --> 28:42.880
and all he keeps thinking is,

28:42.880 --> 28:45.440
Oh, man, I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.080
None of us are supposed
to be here. Fuck, man!

28:48.080 --> 28:50.080
We're just asking
to get waxed.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.000
Dude, all I'm saying is,
they just keep saying,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.640
"All right.
You're going home tomorrow."

28:53.640 --> 28:55.600
And the next day,
it's the same shit.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.800
You're going home tomorrow.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.440
Fuckin' on and on,
week after week.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.600
"You're going home tomorrow."
And we're still here, man.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.680
We're like sitting ducks.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.080
Take care of this,
Sergeant.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.040
Fuckin' Sally, get
that camera out of my face!

29:05.040 --> 29:07.880
What the fuck is your problem?
What are you bitching about?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.880
What, because they
extended our deployment?

29:09.880 --> 29:11.720
Big fuckin' surprise!

29:11.720 --> 29:13.840
Welcome to the goddamn Army!

29:13.840 --> 29:16.320
We all want to fuckin'
go home! We can't.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.240
So stand the fuck up
and be a fucking man about it!

29:19.240 --> 29:21.240
Drive on with
a fuckin' hard-on! Yeah?

29:21.240 --> 29:24.240
Let's go!

29:24.240 --> 29:26.440
Coming here is one step closer
to that appointment.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.520
What'd you say, Gabe?
I said, every fucking day here

29:28.520 --> 29:30.480
is one step closer
to that appointment.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.160
What?

29:32.160 --> 29:35.600
That book, the one that I read to
you, the one that was so boring,

29:35.600 --> 29:37.440
you should check it out.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.960
"Death speaks.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.240
"There was a merchant
in Baghdad

29:49.240 --> 29:51.880
"who sent his servant
to market to buy provisions.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.000
"And in a little while,
the servant came back

29:54.000 --> 29:55.680
"white and trembling,
and said,

29:55.680 --> 29:58.880
"'Master, just now,
when I was in the marketplace,

29:58.880 --> 30:00.600
"'I was jostled
by women in the crowd,

30:00.600 --> 30:03.840
"'and when I turned, I saw
it was Death that jostled me.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.400
"'She looked at me
and made a threatening gesture.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.960
"'Now, lend me your horse,

30:07.960 --> 30:10.800
"'and I will ride away from
the city and avoid my fate.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.880
"I will go to Samarra.
There, Death will not find me.'

30:14.880 --> 30:18.160
"The merchant lent him his
horse, and the servant mounted it,

30:18.160 --> 30:20.000
"and he dug his spurs
in his flanks,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.200
"and as fast as the horse
could gallop, he went.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.640
"Then the merchant
went down to the marketplace,

30:24.640 --> 30:26.400
"and he saw me
standing in the crowd,

30:26.400 --> 30:29.040
"and he came to me and said,

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
"'Why did you make a
threatening gesture to my servant

30:31.040 --> 30:33.600
"when you saw him
this morning?'

30:33.600 --> 30:36.400
"'That was not
a threatening gesture,' I said.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.600
"'It was only
a startled surprise.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.080
"'I was astonished
to see him in Baghdad,

30:41.080 --> 30:45.320
for I had an appointment
with him tonight in Samarra.'"

Dark chocolate.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.640
Those would be
your three wishes

31:57.640 --> 32:00.280
if you found a magic lamp under
one of these fuckin' rocks.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.840
And speaking of
dark chocolate, Salazar.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.760
Hi.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.440
<i>Oh, man. Oh, man.</i>

32:19.960 --> 32:22.200
Ew! It's no good. Dude.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.920
Fuck that!
Give me back my shit!

32:24.920 --> 32:28.800
Snowflake, goddamn it, man!
That's my last one! Fuck!

32:28.800 --> 32:32.040
Jesus! Guys, guys, do
not make a fucking move!

32:32.040 --> 32:35.040
Goddamn it! What the fuck
is behind your eyes?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.360
My brain, Sergeant.
You know what I think?

32:37.360 --> 32:40.360
Hey, Flake, get over here.
Stand right here.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.160
Look alive, Soldier.
Sal, are you getting all this?

32:43.160 --> 32:45.400
I'm getting all of
it. Ask me what I think.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.920
What do you think,
Master Sergeant?

32:46.920 --> 32:49.240
I can't help but think
that Rush ain't gonna make it.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.920
Now, are you listening to
me, Soldier? Yes, Sergeant.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.840
But are you hearing me?
I'm hearing you, Sergeant.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.280
Goddamn it, boy.
You're so dog ugly,

32:54.280 --> 32:56.080
a bullet to your face
would be an improvement.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.640
Now listen up--

32:57.640 --> 33:00.160
Fuck off, Sally. ...as I
educate your boots on the ground.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.360
This ground, this very
terrain that you are at present

33:03.360 --> 33:05.040
brainlessly bobbing
your fat ass over--

33:05.040 --> 33:06.720
Are you listening to me, Rush?
Yes, Sergeant.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.200
But are you hearing me?
I'm hearing you, Sergeant.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.000
Then slow the fuck down!
Reconnoiter.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.360
Recon the area.
Take a look around.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.800
Now answer me this:
Did you or did you not

33:15.800 --> 33:18.080
check out this furniture
here yesterday?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.280
No, Sergeant.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.800
Why not?

33:20.800 --> 33:22.280
Because it wasn't here
yesterday.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.480
That's exactly my point.
So stay the fuck away from it!

33:25.480 --> 33:27.160
Now, look, we came here
in one piece,

33:27.160 --> 33:28.360
and you can bet your ass

33:28.360 --> 33:30.120
we're gonna leave here
in one piece, all right?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.360
Roger that, Sergeant.
Look alive, Soldier.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.520
Roger that, Sergeant.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.600
All right. Come on.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.960
Let's get our asses
out of here.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.600
Goddamn it, Rush!

33:37.600 --> 33:40.600
Shut up!
Fuck!

33:40.600 --> 33:44.640
Oh, fuck!

33:52.680 --> 33:55.280
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

34:09.719 --> 34:15.440
<i>And this shit hole is nothing
but a fuckin' deathtrap.</i>

34:15.480 --> 34:17.239
<i>Oh!</i>

34:17.280 --> 34:19.639
<i>We need to get
the fuck outta here.</i>

34:19.639 --> 34:21.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:21.320 --> 34:24.199
<i>Nuke it and pave it
over, you know?</i>

34:24.199 --> 34:25.719
<i>Pave the whole
fucking thing, man.</i>

34:25.719 --> 34:29.320
<i>Vaporize every last sand
nigger. Goddamn right.</i>

34:29.320 --> 34:33.360
<i>Sweet's the only guy-- the only
guy that ever gave a shit about us,</i>

34:33.360 --> 34:35.400
<i>and they torched him--
they fucking torched him!</i>

34:35.400 --> 34:37.600
<i>Hey, man, if they had
fuckin' sent us home</i>

34:37.600 --> 34:39.239
<i>when they was
supposed to, huh?</i>

34:39.239 --> 34:43.360
<i>Sweetness'd be alive, right?
Partying with us right now.</i>

34:43.360 --> 34:45.360
<i>They're fucking killing
us off one by one.</i>

34:45.360 --> 34:47.000
<i>That's why they took out
the Twin Towers.</i>

34:47.000 --> 34:48.880
<i>Trying to fucking kill us.</i>

34:48.880 --> 34:51.560
<i>No. No, Sally.
To get our attention.</i>

34:51.560 --> 34:53.920
<i>Attention for what?</i>

34:53.920 --> 34:58.040
<i>Jesus Christ, Sally.
Don't you fuckin' get it?</i>

34:58.040 --> 35:01.360
<i>Man, they don't wanna kill us over
there in the good old U.S. of A.</i>

35:01.360 --> 35:03.320
<i>I mean, shit, they do,
but they can't.</i>

35:03.320 --> 35:05.680
<i>It's too fuckin' hard
right now.</i>

35:05.680 --> 35:07.800
<i>Man, they wanna kill us here.</i>

35:07.800 --> 35:11.360
<i>On their turf, in their
fuckin' shit hole country!</i>

35:11.360 --> 35:14.800
<i>Yeah. Where every
turn is the wrong turn.</i>

35:14.800 --> 35:18.120
<i>Every single one of them knew where
that fucking IED was! Goddamn right!</i>

35:18.120 --> 35:20.160
<i>You don't see them
stepping on it? Do you? No!</i>

35:20.160 --> 35:21.840
<i>They just sit
in their fucking backyard,</i>

35:21.840 --> 35:24.120
<i>drinking their fucking tea,</i>

35:24.120 --> 35:25.760
<i>waiting for one of us
poor motherfuckers</i>

35:25.760 --> 35:28.120
<i>to light up their day.
Come on, boys.</i>

35:28.120 --> 35:30.440
<i>Well, guess what. That ain't
gonna happen no more!</i>

35:30.440 --> 35:35.040
<i>Hell, no! There's gonna be one big
fuckin' bitch of a preemptive strike!</i>

35:35.040 --> 35:39.280
<i>Yeah! We're gonna be torching
every last Johnny-fucking-jihad!</i>

35:39.280 --> 35:41.920
<i>Later. And there ain't
gonna be nothing left</i>

35:41.920 --> 35:44.880
<i>but scorched fuckin' earth!</i>

36:28.240 --> 36:30.440
Get down!

36:30.440 --> 36:33.200
Go, go, go, go! Inside,
inside!

36:33.200 --> 36:34.680
Move!
Down!

36:34.680 --> 36:37.720
We got one! We got one!

36:37.720 --> 36:39.200
Down! Clear!
Down!

36:39.200 --> 36:41.320
Get down!

36:41.320 --> 36:43.480
Get down! Get down!

36:43.480 --> 36:44.960
Get down!
This is the guy!

36:44.960 --> 36:48.360
Let's go! Let's go!
We're clear!

36:48.360 --> 36:51.160
Come on, people! Let's go!
Come on!

36:51.160 --> 36:55.800
Check the back! Check the back! Clear!

36:55.800 --> 36:57.920
Move, move, move!

36:57.920 --> 37:00.760
What are you doing?
Oh. Oh, hi.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.240
Uh, well, we're looking
for evidence right now.

37:03.240 --> 37:06.080
Evidence of what?
Evidence of anything

37:06.080 --> 37:08.240
that's gonna help us, uh,
fight the war.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.080
Clear!
Can read that?

37:10.080 --> 37:12.040
Well, no, of course not.
Can have this paper?

37:12.040 --> 37:14.200
No, you can't have...
This is Iraqi, okay?

37:14.200 --> 37:16.480
Iraqi? You mean Arabic?
Arabic. That's right.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.000
This is really important stuff.
So how do you know it's important?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.960
Well, we're gonna find out
if it's important,

37:20.960 --> 37:23.480
'cause I've got people
who can translate this for me.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.640
And, um...
But they're not here right now.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.200
So you guys have to step out.
So how do you know it's evidence?

37:28.200 --> 37:30.240
We're gonna find out
if it's evidence, all right?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.640
Jonesy, let's get these people
out of here. Thank you for coming.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.120
Okay, people, let's go!
Let's go!

37:34.120 --> 37:37.320
Move! Move it! Move it!
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.880
Is this the guy? Yeah,
this is him! Grab him!

37:39.880 --> 37:43.200
Bring him out!

37:43.200 --> 37:46.600
Get down! I won't shoot
you!

37:48.600 --> 37:51.400
Up against the wall. Hands against
the wall. I got him, I got him.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.720
He's clear.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.160
On your knees!

37:54.160 --> 37:57.360
Sit down. Give me the
bag. Give me the bag.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.680
I'm bagging him.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.200
Well, he looks
pretty harmless.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.320
Why are using a hood?

38:02.320 --> 38:05.080
Why are using a hood? Because once
he's bagged, he's like a blind chicken.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.960
He can't run if he can't see.
He can't breathe with that on.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.120
Are you sure he can breathe?
No-- Yes, he can breathe.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.120
Can't you hear him breathing
right now?

38:12.120 --> 38:15.040
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure he can breathe.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.400
She says his back is broken.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.920
The old man's back is broken!
Get off me!

38:20.920 --> 38:23.160
She said the old man's
back is broken!

38:23.160 --> 38:25.600
Can you understand that?
No-- All right. Well...

38:25.600 --> 38:27.200
I'm not carrying
that bag of shit.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.480
Let's go!
Everybody out!

38:28.480 --> 38:30.520
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! 1, 2--

38:34.240 --> 38:36.880
Let's go!
Move, move, move!

38:36.880 --> 38:39.080
Move, move!
Get back!

39:10.680 --> 39:14.240
Good boy.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.240
Uh, we're good.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.240
Right here.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.280
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.280
Arms up. Arms up.
That's it.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.280
Arms-- Arms up.
Arms up. Up. Arms.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.080
Arms.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.600
Arms!

39:44.720 --> 39:46.520
Mmm.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.000
<i>Yella.</i>

40:17.800 --> 40:19.000
Hoo!

40:41.800 --> 40:43.120
<i>¬∂</i>

40:43.120 --> 40:45.040
All the way from Camp Carolina,

40:45.040 --> 40:47.200
<i>it's the first episode
of Drug Poker, baby.</i>

40:47.200 --> 40:49.600
I got an idea. Why don't you
turn off the fucking camera?

40:49.640 --> 40:52.800
Do you guys know how big
high-stakes poker is on TV? So what?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.840
When I sell my show and you guys
become stars, you can all thank me then.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.520
How about that?
Okay, yeah, we'll do that.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.880
Why don't you play the
game right now? I'm playing.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.800
You can't afford us.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.360
There's no way.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.120
Sally? Come on, shithead.
Are you in or out?

41:07.120 --> 41:09.160
All right, all right, all right.
Don't fuck around.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.120
I...am...

41:11.120 --> 41:13.000
Wow. I'm out.
You are so out.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.960
Out again.
What do you know?

41:14.960 --> 41:17.480
I was out.
Show me them. Show me them.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.800
I got two cards. And she's doing
the Pledge of Allegiance, I think.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.480
What you got there, Reno?

41:23.480 --> 41:24.680
What's you say?

41:24.680 --> 41:26.000
"She's doing The Pledge
of Allegiance!"

41:26.000 --> 41:27.520
Reno's doing-- doing
all right. All right.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.400
Mr. Blix?
Um, she's my favorite.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.320
I like her.
Oh, that is a solid choice.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.440
She looks like a nice girl.
Not bad for Mrs. Blix.

41:33.440 --> 41:37.440
Mr. Mactastic? Um, is it wrong to
fall in love with the king of clubs?

41:40.280 --> 41:42.480
If you don't ask
and you don't tell.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.800
There you go.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.320
All right,
out of the cards.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.280
All right.
What's happening right now?

41:47.280 --> 41:50.400
Blix, what do you need?
Blix needs, uh...

41:50.400 --> 41:53.640
Blix needs three, although it's very
hard to say good-bye to the 8 of clubs.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.120
Oh, yes, I'm sure it is.
No, check her out.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.480
Freakie boy.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.000
One.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.720
Are the cards thirsty or
something? I want four.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.200
Ooh.
I'm thirsty.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.200
What?

42:06.200 --> 42:08.840
Did you just say you need four?
Yeah. What's the big fucking deal?

42:08.840 --> 42:11.640
No, it's just--
it's perfect Rush strategy.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.400
Do you even have
an ace, dude?

42:13.400 --> 42:16.160
I have an ace,
and I boned her.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.160
We gotta go back
to that house.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.840
What are you talking about?
What house?

42:20.840 --> 42:22.600
That house we raided last week.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.320
I didn't see any orders
about that.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.480
Dude, we're going to Farah's.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.800
Farah's house. That's right.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.200
What are you guys talking about?
That's not... We just...

42:31.200 --> 42:33.240
There's nothing
in that house.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.240
How can you say that
that tasty skank is nothing?

42:36.240 --> 42:39.760
Come on, dude. We're gonna take
some initiative and go to that house.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.360
She's a spoil of war.
That's right.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.040
Oh, I forgot.
That's exactly right.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.600
Okay, you guys
are fucking crazy.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.240
Come on. They're drunk.
Dude, we're all drunk.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.600
Turn that fucking thing
off.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.600
No, keep that
fucking thing on.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.000
Fuck off! This is off the record,
so turn the fucking camera off!

42:57.000 --> 42:58.920
Back off. All right,
all right. Keep it on!

42:58.920 --> 43:01.680
Fuck off!
Guys, relax.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.160
Let's just play the game. You guys are
really drunk, as I was saying before.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.160
So I actually think maybe... I'm
seeing things clearer than you.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.640
No, you're not seeing
anything clearer, Flake.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.680
Flake, you haven't seen anything
clear in, like, four months.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.200
Stop it!
Who doesn't see clear?

43:12.200 --> 43:15.200
How the fuck am I
supposed to see clearly?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.840
I mean,
what are we doing here?

43:18.840 --> 43:21.200
"What are we doing here?" Yeah,
what the fuck are we doing here?

43:21.200 --> 43:22.640
You know
what we're doing here.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.120
We're helping the new
Iraqi government survive.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.600
Knuckleheads.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.960
And what the fuck
do you think

43:26.960 --> 43:28.240
is so important about that?

43:28.240 --> 43:30.160
I think there's a lot
important about that.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.160
Enlighten me.
We're, you know-- We're--

43:32.160 --> 43:33.960
What?
We're just doing our job.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.120
We're not-- We're not
supposed to think about it.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.840
We're supposed to follow
orders. We're soldiers. Amen.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.200
Yeah.
Welcome to the fucking Army.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.120
But these people
don't want us here.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.640
Yes, they do. No, they don't.
They want us dead and gone.

43:44.640 --> 43:47.680
And when those fucking beltway clerks
finally find that out, we're gonna be both.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.680
So, in the meantime,
Rush and me

43:50.680 --> 43:53.160
and...Gabriel... I have
to say shut the fuck up.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.880
Get away from me,
because I'm not doing...

43:55.880 --> 44:00.200
You're such a pussy! I'm not a pussy because
I don't wanna break through the door...

44:00.200 --> 44:01.880
Oh, no, the door's
already broken down.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.160
The door's already broken down.
The father's locked up.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.320
What's the problem? Nothing
to worry about. Let's do it.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.000
Sounds like the perfect
cap on the evening. I agree.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.440
Yeah, perfect cap on the evening.
I'm gonna go wake up Sarge.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.600
I'm gonna ask him what the SOP is on
a gang rape. You're not gonna say shit!

44:14.600 --> 44:16.480
Don't wake up Sarge for this.
I'm not gonna say shit?

44:16.480 --> 44:21.720
No, you're not gonna say shit. You
know why Sarge is finding out shit?

44:21.720 --> 44:23.560
Why?
Because nothing's gonna happen,

44:23.560 --> 44:26.720
because you guys couldn't even get
outside the wire if you wanted to.

44:26.720 --> 44:30.160
Get your fucking hands off me!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out. Cut it out.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.920
That's bullshit!
Sit down, sit down.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.560
If you can find your chair.
Got it.

44:36.560 --> 44:39.360
All right. Can we
play the fucking game?

44:39.360 --> 44:42.520
Jesus Christ, Gabe!
What do you think, Sally?

44:42.520 --> 44:46.440
I-- I think I'm gonna be going for
this little-- this little jaunt.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.440
Yeah, you are, baby!

44:50.720 --> 44:52.520
Sally's got a set of balls.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.160
What about you, McCoy?
Are you serious?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.840
Come on, dude. Come with.
Get your fucking hand off me.

44:56.840 --> 44:59.000
No, fuck him.
Pussy boy doesn't want to go.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.760
Dude, let me
tell you something.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.520
First of all, y'all
are drunk. Thank you.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.440
Probably high doing all
sorts of fucking drugs

45:05.440 --> 45:07.360
or whatever the hell
you're doing.

45:07.360 --> 45:11.040
You're fucked-up.
But?

45:11.040 --> 45:14.720
If I go, it's to make sure you don't get
your asses killed. That's right. When we go.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.560
We are not
gonna get killed!

45:19.080 --> 45:21.240
<i>"Hello, honey.</i>

45:21.240 --> 45:25.680
<i>"I don't have much time,
but I have to send you this.</i>

45:25.680 --> 45:30.320
<i>"First, I want you to know
that I love you very much.</i>

45:30.320 --> 45:32.280
<i>"I miss you more every day</i>

45:32.280 --> 45:34.760
<i>"and can't wait to touch
your beautiful face.</i>

45:38.280 --> 45:39.840
<i>"I was looking
at the pictures</i>

45:39.840 --> 45:42.400
<i>"you just sent me
of you and the boys.</i>

45:42.400 --> 45:45.720
<i>"I'm wishing to God
I was there instead of here.</i>

45:48.080 --> 45:50.120
<i>"The guys have been
drinking all day,</i>

45:50.120 --> 45:53.560
<i>"and it looks like they're
going out looking for trouble.</i>

45:53.560 --> 45:54.760
<i>"I can't stop them,</i>

45:54.760 --> 45:56.240
<i>"but I'm going to make sure</i>

45:56.240 --> 45:59.160
<i>"they don't
get themselves hurt.</i>

45:59.160 --> 46:01.320
<i>"You just can't go outside
and blow off steam here.</i>

46:01.320 --> 46:03.560
<i>"It's too dangerous.</i>

46:03.560 --> 46:07.600
<i>"Anyway, I love you.</i>

46:07.600 --> 46:08.800
<i>Lawyer."</i>

46:15.920 --> 46:17.920
<i>I knew he was doing
raids outside the wire,</i>

46:17.920 --> 46:21.360
<i>but he hadn't done
too many in a while,</i>

46:21.360 --> 46:24.400
<i>and I-I'd built up
a sense of security</i>

46:24.400 --> 46:25.280
<i>in knowing this.</i>

46:29.120 --> 46:33.280
<i>I live for his phone calls
and his chats online, you know?</i>

46:34.640 --> 46:36.280
<i>They help me not
to worry so much.</i>

46:40.840 --> 46:42.800
<i>But today is--</i>

46:45.280 --> 46:46.800
<i>...is different.</i>

46:55.440 --> 46:58.320
<i>Oh, my--</i>

47:00.320 --> 47:04.200
<i>Um, I'm scared. I'm--</i>

47:04.200 --> 47:06.840
<i>I'm scared to death for him.</i>

47:12.800 --> 47:14.720
I rigged a mini-cam
to my helmet

47:14.720 --> 47:16.160
so I can record
tonight's follies

47:16.160 --> 47:17.920
without the guys
knowing about it.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.600
I don't want 'em
getting camera-shy.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.600
<i>So what are you
gonna do?</i>

47:28.600 --> 47:30.160
<i>I don't know, man.
I'm gonna--</i>

47:30.160 --> 47:32.240
<i>...go with them and try to
talk some sense into them.</i>

47:32.240 --> 47:34.240
<i>Dude, they're going to get
about 20 feet outside there,</i>

47:34.240 --> 47:35.680
<i>they'll get scared
of the dark,</i>

47:35.680 --> 47:37.720
<i>and come right back here.
And what about Sally?</i>

47:37.720 --> 47:40.560
<i>Sa-- Man, you know,
Sally-- What's he doing?</i>

47:40.560 --> 47:44.200
<i>He's gonna go out there, come
running back to base camp,</i>

47:44.200 --> 47:47.200
<i>turn on his camcorder and give a
firsthand account of what he saw.</i>

47:47.200 --> 47:50.120
<i>It's sick.
It's fuckin' sick.</i>

47:50.120 --> 47:51.920
<i>It's a pretty juicy
story, though, isn't it?</i>

47:54.120 --> 47:56.840
<i>"Our band of brothers
losing their moral compass</i>

47:56.840 --> 48:00.600
<i>and trying to wreak vengeance
on a 15-year-old girl.</i>

48:00.600 --> 48:02.600
<i>It's unbelievable.
Yeah.</i>

48:02.600 --> 48:05.320
<i>Ride the cable news chain all
the way up to 60 fucking Minutes.</i>

48:05.320 --> 48:06.960
<i>Hey.
Hey, Rush. What's up, man?</i>

48:08.480 --> 48:10.080
<i>What the fuck
are you two doing?</i>

48:10.080 --> 48:12.640
<i>Just talking, you know.
Smoking.</i>

48:12.640 --> 48:15.640
<i>Oh. Thought you quit.</i>

48:15.640 --> 48:19.480
<i>Uh, no. No, I--
I never quit.</i>

48:20.800 --> 48:22.480
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

48:22.480 --> 48:24.000
<i>Temper, temper!</i>

48:24.000 --> 48:27.400
<i>Hot damn. The fuckin'
pussy's on the rag again.</i>

48:27.400 --> 48:29.640
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

48:29.640 --> 48:32.200
<i>Hey, man. Where's your gear?
Rush, dude. Come on.</i>

48:32.200 --> 48:34.120
<i>Let's think about this.
I mean seriously.</i>

48:34.120 --> 48:35.680
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

48:35.680 --> 48:37.280
<i>Fuck that, dude. Fuck that.</i>

48:37.280 --> 48:40.400
<i>Shut up, man.
I'm all thunk out, okay?</i>

48:40.400 --> 48:43.920
<i>My fuck stick needs some
pussy. Like right now.</i>

48:43.920 --> 48:46.520
<i>Okay? Whackin' off in a sock just
ain't cuttin' it no more, man.</i>

48:48.360 --> 48:50.160
<i>This fucking baby
is hurtin'!</i>

48:50.200 --> 48:54.960
<i>It's like all red, and sore,
and chapped and shit, man.</i>

48:54.960 --> 48:58.280
<i>And there is nothing like
some sweet hajji ass</i>

48:58.280 --> 49:00.560
<i>that is going to get this
plumbing right back into alignment.</i>

49:00.560 --> 49:02.960
<i>You can't be fucking serious.
I am dead serious, dude.</i>

49:02.960 --> 49:06.160
<i>So get your fuckin'
gear on, and let's go!</i>

49:06.160 --> 49:08.760
<i>Go on! Get your fuckin'
shit on! McCord--</i>

49:08.760 --> 49:10.600
<i>McCord, this is fuckin'--
And you! You, you!</i>

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
<i>Get your fuckin' hands
off me! Shut the fuck up!</i>

49:12.600 --> 49:14.320
<i>Shut up! Just shut up!</i>

49:14.320 --> 49:17.640
<i>You listen to me like you never
listened before in your life.</i>

49:17.640 --> 49:19.320
<i>If I hear you breathing
one word</i>

49:19.320 --> 49:20.960
<i>about anything
that goes on here tonight,</i>

49:20.960 --> 49:24.560
<i>so help me God, I will cut
your fucking tongue out.</i>

49:24.560 --> 49:27.160
<i>And I'll feed it to
that fucking dog of yours.</i>

49:27.160 --> 49:29.160
<i>You get me?</i>

49:29.160 --> 49:31.160
<i>Do you get me, Blix?</i>

49:31.160 --> 49:34.880
<i>Yeah.
Good boy.</i>

49:34.880 --> 49:37.080
<i>Now why don't you get
the fuck out of here?</i>

49:37.120 --> 49:38.680
<i>Go read some Shakespeare.</i>

49:48.680 --> 49:50.520
I'm talking about the
girl, man. The girl?

49:50.520 --> 49:52.320
I'm talking about fucking
with a 15-year-old girl.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.440
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're all discombobulated.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.760
<i>You got to lay off
that hajji juice,</i>

49:56.760 --> 49:58.240
'cause that is
some sneaky shit.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.600
I don't touch that fucking
shit, you know that.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.160
Really? What the fuck
are you doing up here?

50:01.160 --> 50:02.760
You're supposed to be
at the rear. Excuse me?

50:02.760 --> 50:04.160
You giving me
an order, Private Flake?

50:04.160 --> 50:06.080
That's right, Corporal.
Get to the fuckin' rear!

50:07.520 --> 50:09.720
Fuck off me!

50:09.720 --> 50:11.680
Fuck you!
Fuck off, bitch.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.560
McCoy! McCoy,
you're not going to go in?

50:13.560 --> 50:15.320
Fuck it!
McCoy, come on!

50:15.320 --> 50:17.320
What's your excuse, Sally? Huh?
Excuse for what?

50:17.320 --> 50:19.080
Excuse for wanting
to take a part of this, huh?

50:19.080 --> 50:21.800
McCoy, I'm a fly on the wall. I got
to get a record of what's happening.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.280
That's right, you're the
fly on the fuckin' wall. Yes!

50:24.280 --> 50:27.080
Actually, Sally, I think
you're a fuckin' jackal!

50:27.080 --> 50:29.000
Ripping meat off
a fucking carcass!

50:29.000 --> 50:31.080
That's what you are.
Can I quote you on that one?

50:31.080 --> 50:32.720
Sure, Sally, quote away.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.240
You know what? I got another quote
for you. You ready? What? What?

50:35.240 --> 50:38.920
Take a look around you at all your
greedy, media buddies-- You dick.

50:38.920 --> 50:42.000
...who sold their soul for
a talk show and a book deal!

50:42.000 --> 50:44.640
'Cause that's what you are! This is my
free pass into film school, right now.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.360
Really? Well done, Sally.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.440
Take it all down,
cry for cry,

50:48.440 --> 50:49.680
and scream for scream--
go ahead!

50:49.680 --> 50:51.400
Thanks for your permission,
there, dick.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.720
Oh, look out there, Mac.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.760
I don't want you tripping
over your goddamn soapbox.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.680
Fuck it.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.840
Fuck you!

51:02.480 --> 51:05.040
Flake! Flake.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.600
Flake,
enough's enough, man.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.240
Enough's enough.
You've had your fun.

51:09.240 --> 51:12.640
Let's get out of here.
We're just gettin' started.

51:12.640 --> 51:15.680
We just got here. What
the fuck's your problem, McCoy?

51:15.680 --> 51:17.680
You shouldn't be here,
Flake, and you know it.

51:17.680 --> 51:21.040
We're just here, man.
We're here,

51:21.040 --> 51:24.080
and we are gonna fuckin'
find these--

51:24.080 --> 51:27.200
weapons-- we're searching
for evidence--

51:27.200 --> 51:30.480
We're looking for weapons
of mass destruction!

51:30.480 --> 51:32.240
Weapons of mass destruction.
That's right.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.720
I don't give a shit
what anybody says.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.160
They're here, and
we're going to find them.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.200
Flake, there is nothing
here, and you know it!

51:37.200 --> 51:39.280
What are you fucking-- We ripped
this place apart last week.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.600
There's nothing here!
They're just like weeds, McCoy.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.520
You rip 'em up, they're all
back the next day, aren't they?

51:44.520 --> 51:47.360
She's a 15-year-old girl, man.
She's a 15-year-old girl.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.400
We're going to accomplish this
mission. Please don't do this.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.160
We are going to conquer that.
It's inhuman to rape.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.760
She's a fine cunt, just like
everybody else in this fucking country.

51:56.760 --> 52:00.080
I'm not doin' it, man.
You fuckin' candy ass!

52:00.080 --> 52:02.120
Well, you're not doin' it!
Shut the fuck up.

52:02.120 --> 52:04.120
Are you not
supporting the troops?

52:04.120 --> 52:05.960
What? Are you not supporting the troops?

52:05.960 --> 52:08.120
No.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.800
Oops. Did I just blow
your fuckin' head off?

52:10.800 --> 52:13.720
Don't.
Where are your balls, McCoy?

52:13.720 --> 52:15.880
Man, I thought you had a
pair. What are they, at home?

52:15.880 --> 52:18.400
<i>Inside your wife's
sandy hajj pussy?</i>

52:18.440 --> 52:19.760
God!

52:19.760 --> 52:21.640
Fuck you!

52:21.640 --> 52:24.280
Thought you had a pair.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.320
How about you, Rush?
Where are your balls?

52:26.320 --> 52:27.960
They're almost
in her ass, sir.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.760
Almost in her ass.
What about you, Sally?

52:30.760 --> 52:33.400
Get it up!
"I can't hear you, sir."

52:33.400 --> 52:35.360
They're right here. I can't
hear you. I can't hear you!

52:35.360 --> 52:36.600
They're right here!
Where are your balls?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.320
They're right here!
Good!

52:40.160 --> 52:41.880
All right.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.880
All right, motherfucker.
Hitch a ride outside.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.400
Take the faggot watch. Yeah,
take the faggot watch, you pussy!

52:46.400 --> 52:49.920
Bunch of fuckin' assholes.
Fuck you.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.480
What do you think
of that, huh?

52:51.480 --> 52:52.840
Ooh, did you like that?

52:52.840 --> 52:55.240
Did you miss me, huh?

52:58.360 --> 53:01.120
Oh, it's go time for you.
You ready?

53:01.120 --> 53:03.560
Huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:03.560 --> 53:06.440
So, you ready?
Here you go, here you go.

53:06.440 --> 53:09.640
Come here, Salazar. Come
here. Take her fucking hand.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.120
Take her fucking hand!
Rush. Rush.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.640
Rush, hold on!

53:12.640 --> 53:14.440
Wait. Wait for Flake. Hold
on, Rush. Wait for Flake.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.600
This is his idea. He gets
the cherry. Come on, wait up.

53:17.600 --> 53:20.680
What? You got a problem
with sloppy seconds?

53:24.920 --> 53:28.400
Holy shit!

53:28.400 --> 53:30.240
He tried to use
this on me.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.960
Motherfuck.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.000
Those motherfuckers! What
the fuck do you think I did?

53:34.000 --> 53:37.160
I fuckin' killed them all.
I killed them all.

53:37.200 --> 53:39.240
Every fuckin' one of them.

53:39.240 --> 53:41.120
They're fuckin'
all gone, baby.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.960
They're all fuckin' gone.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.680
All right.
Sally, come on over here, baby.

53:46.680 --> 53:49.080
It's showtime. Take the
fuckin' hand. Here we go.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.160
Oh. You ready? You ready for
the ride of your life, bitch?

53:56.520 --> 54:00.840
Shut the fuck up! Don't
you fuckin' make a sound!

54:00.840 --> 54:02.920
Give it to her!

54:02.920 --> 54:06.280
Aah!

54:12.560 --> 54:15.000
God!
What happened?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.440
What happened in there?
Talk to me!

54:19.680 --> 54:22.560
<i>Tell them-- No! Fuck!
What are you talking about?</i>

54:22.560 --> 54:25.720
<i>McCoy!</i>

54:25.720 --> 54:27.400
<i>What's up, Rush?</i>

54:27.400 --> 54:29.440
<i>What are you doing?
What am I doing?</i>

54:29.440 --> 54:30.560
<i>What are you telling Blix? Nothing.</i>

54:30.560 --> 54:33.320
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, man.</i>

54:33.320 --> 54:34.400
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, huh?</i>

54:34.400 --> 54:35.960
<i>Get the fuck off him, Rush.
Back off!</i>

54:35.960 --> 54:38.440
<i>Back off, Blix!
I'll cut you like a pig!</i>

54:38.440 --> 54:40.200
<i>Sit down.
Okay, okay.</i>

54:40.200 --> 54:42.720
<i>Get the fuck off me! If you
fuckin' move, I'll snap it.</i>

54:42.720 --> 54:44.760
<i>It'll be real quick.
Piece of shit.</i>

54:44.760 --> 54:47.080
<i>I want you to listen
to me real careful, Mac.</i>

54:47.080 --> 54:49.600
<i>Listen to what?</i>

54:49.600 --> 54:52.480
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

54:52.480 --> 54:55.400
<i>What?
Are you fucking deaf, McCoy?</i>

54:55.400 --> 54:57.080
<i>Am I speaking too softly
for you? No, I hear you.</i>

54:57.080 --> 54:59.200
<i>All right. So you're tuned
in on my frequency, right?</i>

54:59.200 --> 55:00.720
<i>Yes. Good. Now let me ask you again.</i>

55:00.720 --> 55:03.120
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

55:03.120 --> 55:04.240
<i>Yes, I've been
to fucking Vegas.</i>

55:04.240 --> 55:07.680
<i>Good. Now what
do they say?</i>

55:07.680 --> 55:11.320
<i>Uh-- What do they say
about what happens there?</i>

55:11.320 --> 55:13.240
<i>It stays there.
I'm sorry. What was that?</i>

55:13.240 --> 55:14.920
<i>It stays there.</i>

55:14.920 --> 55:16.640
<i>"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."</i>

55:16.640 --> 55:19.040
<i>That's right.
That's right, Big Mac.</i>

55:19.040 --> 55:21.600
<i>Now I want you to think
about our little trip tonight,</i>

55:21.600 --> 55:24.000
<i>like it was a trip to Vegas. Okay.</i>

55:24.000 --> 55:25.320
<i>You read me, soldier?
Yes, I read you.</i>

55:25.320 --> 55:26.720
<i>Do you fuckin' read me?
Yes, I hear you!</i>

55:38.840 --> 55:41.480
<i>Sometimes, man--</i>

55:41.480 --> 55:44.440
<i>I swear to God.</i>

55:44.480 --> 55:47.000
<i>For a college boy, you can
be real fucking stupid.</i>

55:47.000 --> 55:49.280
<i>Where's Flake, Rush?</i>

55:52.120 --> 55:54.280
<i>What the fuck
do you care, hairball?</i>

55:54.280 --> 55:55.960
<i>Huh?</i>

55:55.960 --> 55:59.040
<i>For your information, our boy
Flake is inside right now.</i>

55:59.040 --> 56:02.920
<i>Sleeping like
a little baby.</i>

56:02.920 --> 56:06.040
<i>You know what
that's like, right, Blix?</i>

56:06.040 --> 56:07.280
<i>Right after you've been
sucked and fucked?</i>

56:13.280 --> 56:15.800
<i>Hey, Mac, man.
Where were you?</i>

56:15.800 --> 56:17.160
<i>What do you mean,
where was I?</i>

56:17.160 --> 56:18.960
<i>I mean, what the fuck
happened to you?</i>

56:18.960 --> 56:20.920
<i>I went outside.
I was on watch.</i>

56:20.920 --> 56:23.040
<i>Flake stuck a gun
in my face. You remember that?</i>

56:23.040 --> 56:26.120
<i>That's right, that's right.
You were on watch.</i>

56:26.120 --> 56:27.800
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

56:30.200 --> 56:34.400
<i>Ah. No, I didn't
see anything.</i>

56:34.400 --> 56:37.400
<i>Well, that's good. That's good,
because you were on watch, right?</i>

56:37.400 --> 56:38.760
<i>Yeah, I was on watch, so--</i>

56:38.760 --> 56:40.200
<i>I mean, it was kind of
dark out there, too.</i>

56:40.200 --> 56:41.680
<i>Yeah, it was
pitch dark, actually.</i>

56:41.680 --> 56:44.480
<i>Yeah.</i>

56:44.480 --> 56:45.840
<i>What about the fire?
Did you see the fire?</i>

56:48.400 --> 56:50.680
<i>Fire?
It was a big fuckin' fire.</i>

56:50.680 --> 56:53.360
<i>You didn't see that?
No, I didn't see it.</i>

56:53.360 --> 56:55.160
<i>I had my back
to the house,</i>

56:55.160 --> 56:57.560
<i>just looking around,
so I guess I must have</i>

56:57.560 --> 56:58.760
<i>missed the fire.</i>

56:58.760 --> 57:00.840
<i>That's good.
That's good, man.</i>

57:00.840 --> 57:02.360
<i>And what about
the insurgents?</i>

57:04.040 --> 57:07.040
<i>Insurgents?
Yeah, man.</i>

57:07.040 --> 57:09.000
<i>We had to hightail it
out of there.</i>

57:09.000 --> 57:10.640
<i>They were
like, all over the place.</i>

57:10.640 --> 57:12.680
<i>And really pissed.</i>

57:12.680 --> 57:15.640
<i>Mm.</i>

57:15.640 --> 57:19.480
<i>That must have been one of
those Sunni-Shiite things.</i>

57:19.480 --> 57:22.280
<i>Right.
You know, I mean--</i>

57:22.280 --> 57:25.520
<i>We don't want to get caught
in a civil war crossfire.</i>

57:25.520 --> 57:31.360
<i>So the, uh, insurgents
set the fire.</i>

57:31.360 --> 57:33.400
<i>Yeah, it must have been.</i>

57:36.360 --> 57:39.960
<i>Because you know,</i>

57:39.960 --> 57:41.800
<i>when they're not trying
to kill us,</i>

57:43.560 --> 57:45.240
<i>Yeah, they're torchi''
each other.</i>

59:27.720 --> 59:30.320
And when did you start
having these dreams?

59:31.680 --> 59:36.400
A couple nights.
I couldn't sleep.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.320
I don't want to sleep.

59:41.120 --> 59:44.240
Can you remember anything?
Anything that happened

59:44.240 --> 59:46.840
that could have
triggered them?

59:48.840 --> 59:52.120
Yeah, after Sweet died?

59:52.120 --> 59:54.800
And I was shooting it
when it happened.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.960
He got blown apart.
I got it all on tape.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.360
His arm landed
right in front of me.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.360
Have you looked
at the video?

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.400
Couple of times,
but then I stop,

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.840
but it kept going, going over
and over again in my head.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.320
That's when I began
hating everyone.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.080
<i>Every hajji out there.</i>

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.520
I couldn't stand the sight of
them, and I got angry all the time.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.240
And then I couldn't sleep,
and every time I did,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.400
I'd have the same dream
of her body burning.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.160
Her body?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.600
No. No.
No, his body.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.440
Sweet's body.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.080
It gets mixed up
in my head.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.560
And you videoed it.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.480
Yeah. It's part of my diary
of my experiences here.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.360
I'm going to use it
to get into film school.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.360
Is this part
of your experience?

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.200
What, talking to you?
Yeah.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.440
Talking to me.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.920
I can't do it anymore.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.560
Everything
you shouldn't see,

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.000
just because you're watching it
doesn't mean you're not a part of it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.120
That's what everyone does, you know?
They just watch, and they do nothing.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.680
Or they make a
video for people to watch,

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.080
and they do nothing!

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.760
Got to tell someone.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.600
It's driving me crazy.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.200
Dad, if something happened,

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.200
something really,
really horrible,

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.560
and you knew who
was responsible,

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.040
isn't it your duty
to say something?

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.080
What did you do?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.080
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do a damn thing.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.560
A couple of my buddies--

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.480
Members of your squad?
Yes, sir.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.240
I hope you realize how serious
this situation could be.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.920
Yes, I do realize.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.440
We don't need another
Abu Ghraib.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.960
I understand that,
sir, but--

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.880
I mean, if your brothers
screwed up,

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.560
that behavior reflects
on the whole Corps.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.120
There was a crime, sir. I
think charges should be brought.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.280
Son, listen to me.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.760
Do you know the first thing
to come into question

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.280
in a court martial
in a thing like this

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.360
will be your sanity.
My sanity?

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.120
That's right! Your sanity,
for bringing charges like this.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.640
I don't care.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.120
I don't care.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.120
Here I am, Mama, in
beautiful, downtown Samarra,

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.120
getting you
a homecoming present.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.160
I've been shooting
some unbelievable stuff.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.040
I can't show it to anybody, because
I'd get in a lot of trouble here.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.000
But when I get back,
everyone's going to see this.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.080
The truth about
what's going down here.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.720
24 times a second,
24/7--

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.120
Get off! Rush! Rush!

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.280
Fuck. Sally, where
the fuck did you go?

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.720
Mount up!

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.200
The body being
loaded into this military ambulance

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.600
is believed to be that of the U.S.
soldier missing since last Friday.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.240
That's according to Iraq Defense
Ministry Secretary, Abdul Aziz.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.600
This Bedouin encampment
where the body was discovered

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.520
just moments ago is outside
the Samarra base camp

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.240
where the soldier
was kidnapped.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.320
The Pentagon has not yet
issued a statement

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.800
on the identity of the body,

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.680
but senior sources tell us it
could be the body of Angel Salazar,

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.320
who went missing last Friday.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.120
Iraqi Defense Ministry
spokesmen have said

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.440
the details are
very disturbing.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.120
There are signs of
torture and decapitation.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.280
<i>Allahu Akbhar! Allahu
Akbhar! Allahu Akbhar!</i>

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.480
Private Flake,

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.240
what kind of a soldier

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.840
was your fallen friend,

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.960
Angel Salazar?

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.320
<i>And take your time.</i>

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.560
What the fuck?

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.200
What do you think I was
doing? I was taking my time.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.000
Jesus Christ, Snowflake.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.440
Don't get a fuckin'
hard-on, man, all right?

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.000
I'm trying to make this
official and everything.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
All right?
All right.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.320
Uh, Private,
how-how would you

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:24.280
summarize
your buddy?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.440
I mean, you know,
if you take all of

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.040
his...his parts,

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.000
and you like stack them,
one on top of one another,

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.040
right, what would--
What would--

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.080
<i>What would be the one
word that would--</i>

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.360
...be the sum of those parts? Generous?

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.160
Generous.
He was a generous spic.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.960
That's a very good word.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.920
And how
was he generous?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.520
He was a...
dedicated reporter.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.640
He used that camera.
This camera right here?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.600
To record his-- our--
war stories.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.600
Stories that will
last on into history.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.560
Long after
you and me are gone.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:18.560
He was like our
very own Private...Ryan.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.800
Hey-up!

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.720
Semper fi, brother.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.600
Semper fuckin' fi,
fuck Marines.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.160
Okay.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.280
What would be, Private,

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.720
your last memory

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.360
of our brother Salazar?

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.720
I--

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.000
...just can't
talk about it.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.920
I understand.
This is hard.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.240
But I can talk
about my brother.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.800
And the life lessons
that he taught me.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.560
<i>Well, lay it on me.</i>

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.360
My brother, Vegas Flake.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.760
Really, you have a
brother named Vegas? Yep.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.560
I have a brother named
Vegas. Reno and Vegas.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.800
Daddy was a gambler,

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.080
and he named his
two favorite sons

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.720
after his two
favorite places.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.960
Hmm.
Called us his wild cards.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.840
That's nice.
Yeah, I thought so.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.200
I do, too.
Vegas was a Teamster.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.600
Mm-hmm.
And the head of his local,

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.000
Mike Dancer,
he's a troublemaker.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.760
He'd run for president
of the U.T.,

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.520
and lost, now the bitter prick
Dancer's contesting the election.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.680
Got ahold of some
ballot boxes

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.760
that my brother Vegas
had rigged,

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.240
and he's blowing his whistle
to federal prosecutors.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.120
Nothing but a fucking rat.
Word comes down.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.359
He's got to go.

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:59.200
So, what happened?

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.399
A fucking embarrassment.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.920
A bunch of clowns who need a road
map to find their own assholes

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.880
drive out to his house
one night.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.319
Knock on the door.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:15.640
And are they, like,
locked and loaded?

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.240
Yeah! Yeah, they are
locked and loaded.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.319
So? So.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.920
Dancer opens the door.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.520
He's there, big as life
in his shorts and T-shirt,

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.200
holding his fucking
newspaper?

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.200
And what do you think
our Wild Bunch did?

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.920
They just blasted
the shit out of him, right?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.680
Wrong. They asked him
for a job.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.680
A job.
Yeah, that's right.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.560
A job. They're too
chickenshit to shoot him.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.560
He's the head of a local.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.439
Since they're not getting paid
for not killing him--

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:50.200
and what the fuck are they
doing on his doorstep anyway--

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.240
they ask him for a job.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.920
They really asked him
for a job?

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.800
Yeah, he says to 'em, too.
He's like,

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.440
"Come by the office in the morning.
I'll see what I can do for you."

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.840
They get in the car,
drive to the nearest bar.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.440
Fucking embarrassment.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.280
Right, I don't get it.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.880
Listen on, my man.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.160
Clyde, the mastermind
of this group,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.320
sees my brother--

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.280
Vegas.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.000
...playing pool.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.200
Invites him in the back room,
says Dancer's going down.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.160
Vegas has got his own
beef with Dancer, right?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.760
Contract for 20,000? My brother
says he'll do it for ten.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.720
What about the other
guys, says Clyde.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.240
What about the other guys,
says my brother.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.080
I-I-- I still
don't get it, though.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.240
They drive back out
to Dancer's.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.840
Opens the door.
Oh, shit.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.000
Shorts, T-shirt.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.760
Vegas shoots him in the face.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.640
Steps over the body,

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.480
goes upstairs,
kills the wife and kids,

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:06.000
in and out, five minutes.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.800
End of story.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.760
Wow. Um--

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.280
All right. So, uh,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.280
All right.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800
Great story.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.320
All right. Private,

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.800
what would you say
would be the lesson

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.200
that we have
learned here today?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.400
Uh, the lesson is that,
when you're on a mission,

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.080
a deadly mission--

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.640
Deadly mission.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.960
It's all about having
the right mix of guys.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.840
And in that mix, there's
got to be the wild card.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.800
Vegas was the wild card.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
And so am I.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.840
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.240
And what has become
of the wild card, Vegas?

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.320
He's dead.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.320
He died in prison.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.320
Jesus.
He got caught?

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.600
Took about, what, 24 hours.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.040
Cops come knocking
on Clyde's door,

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.120
they flip him,
go to the bar,

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.840
find Vegas--

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.840
Only takes one fucking rat
to bring the whole house down.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.880
Jesus, dude. What are you
looking at me for?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.560
I'm sorry.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.360
You know, my mom always told
me it was impolite to stare.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.000
Come on, dude.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.080
I mean, what about
the other guys?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.400
What about the other guys?

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Well, McCoy didn't
see nothing.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.400
And Angel--

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.720
Well, kind of
lost his head.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.400
<i>I am making this video</i>

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.560
<i>to expose a situation
that happened to my squad</i>

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.640
<i>that I think people
should know about.</i>

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.760
<i>I'm hiding my identity
from the public</i>

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.800
<i>because I'm afraid
that the F.B.I.,</i>

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.640
<i>and the Department
of Defense,</i>

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.880
<i>and even the Insurgents
can trace my I.D.</i>

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.400
<i>and find me.</i>

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.920
<i>They already got
one of my guys,</i>

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.560
<i>and I'm not going
to take any chances.</i>

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.680
<i>But this needs to be said.</i>

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.840
<i>For legal reasons,
and for my personal safety,</i>

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.120
<i>I cannot reveal
the time or the place</i>

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.480
<i>or the soldiers involved,</i>

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.480
<i>but believe me, everything
I'm about to tell you,</i>

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.760
<i>everything is absolutely true.</i>

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.920
<i>When I was stationed
in the Middle East,</i>

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.760
<i>two men from my squad
raped and killed</i>

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.080
<i>a 15-year-old girl,
killed her little sister,</i>

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.640
<i>killed her mother,
and killed her grandfather</i>

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.440
<i>and no one has done
a thing about it.</i>

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.840
<i>I'm posting this
on the Internet</i>

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.560
<i>in hopes that someone
from my squad,</i>

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.000
<i>anyone, will see it,
and will help me, please,</i>

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.320
<i>bring this forward, and
bring this out into the light.</i>

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.640
Did you see the woman
being raped?

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.400
Yeir. Well, uh,
not really.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.760
Rush was holding her down
when I went outside.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.400
Well, to do what?
To get away.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.800
I didn't think they were
actually going to do it.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.240
How did you know her?

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.000
Flake put a gun in my face
and told me to go on watch.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.280
How did you know her?

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.440
She would go in and out
of our checkpoint every day.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.200
Rush would take a little
extra time with her.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.680
Said he was just
being thorough.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.200
And why did you
make this assumption

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.120
that she was a girl
and not a woman?

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.760
Because she was
younger than that.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.360
She didn't look that old,
so I just assumed that she--

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.640
Wasn't she an insurgent,
resisting arrest?

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.640
Uh, no. No.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.200
She was just a girl.
She was scared to death.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.320
How do you know
she wasn't scared to death

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.160
because she was an insurgent
resisting arrest?

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.680
Because, um,

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.640
Flake said that we were
going to get this girl

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.840
and "have a little fun."

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.720
Oh, that's new.
When did he say that?

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.840
He said it when we were
playing poker one night.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.280
I thought he was
just kidding around.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.960
Did you see Flake
rape her?

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.680
No, I told you.
I went outside.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.160
So what did you see?
I didn't see him ra--

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.960
I heard some shots.
I heard some screams.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.000
Then what happened?
Then I went up the stairs,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.240
and I saw Salazar, and he
told me what happened inside.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.040
You didn't actually
see him shoot her.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.640
No, but Flake had a gun
pointed at her head--

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.240
So did Salazar and Rush
have guns?

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.520
Yes, sir. Rush had a gun.
Did you have a gun?

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.400
Yes, sir, I did. Couldn't
Rush have shot her?

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.440
No! I--
Couldn't you have shot her?

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.720
I didn't shoot the girl.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.080
But when you saw her,
she was still alive.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.800
I told you. I didn't
go back inside.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.840
Salazar said-- We're not
interested in what Salazar said.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.040
We're interested in
what you saw.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.080
Flake shot her
in the face!

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.120
So you believed
she was dead.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.760
Yes! I believed
she was dead.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.560
But you didn't
see him shoot her.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.760
No, but I didn't know--

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.240
And you didn't
see him rape her.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.440
No, but that's
not the point!

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.840
What is the point?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.080
Isn't your testimony that you
were outside keeping watch?

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.200
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to see it,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.080
and I didn't want
to be a part of it.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:51.880
Why don't you believe me?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.720
This is the scene

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.320
of one of the most
shocking crimes

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.760
alleged to have been
carried out

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.880
by American
soldiers in Iraq.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.960
According to evidence
at the hearing,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.800
one July evening,
four U.S. soldiers

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.240
came to this house here.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.000
According to Lawyer McCoy's
statement,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.440
Reno Flake and B.B. Rush

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.800
repeatedly raped
a 15-year-old girl.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.760
In another room,

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.320
the girl's grandfather,
mother, and little sister

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.720
were shot dead.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.280
This man, Private Reno Flake,

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.560
is accused of committing
all the murders.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.360
His accomplice,
B.B. Rush, was taken--

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.760
We were securing the area.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.080
We checked everyone
and everything.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.000
And that girl went in
and out of our checkpoint

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.800
again and again.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800
So, yeah, I checked
her thoroughly.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.160
Every fucking time, because there
was something fishy about her.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.400
"Fishy"? What exactly do you
mean by fishy, Specialist Rush?

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.120
Fishy, fishy, like
she was up to something.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.120
And I'll deal you
one more card.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.760
It's angel faces
like hers

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.720
that are going to walk right up to
you and give you a great big smile,

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.640
and then blow you
the fuck apart.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.360
And sure as shit,
the next day,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.280
the very
next fucking day,

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.800
one of my best buddies

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.920
got torched on a path that
she just walked right over.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.640
Didn't miss a beat.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.720
So don't you dare sit there
for one second and think

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.000
that she didn't know where
that fuckin' IED was planted.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.760
You know, I went back
to the house because

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.560
I knew they were hiding
weapons and shit?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.240
I mean, hell,
that old man,

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:44.040
broken back, tried to
shoot me with an AK-47.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.560
You know-- Hey--

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.800
It really
pisses me off, sir,

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.960
when I think of everything

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.240
we've done for these
sand niggers?

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.120
Got rid of Saddam,
planted democracy,

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.920
giving up our lives to keep them
safe from their own insurgents,

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.600
and I'm not looking
for a thank-you, but--

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.800
I want them to stop
trying to kill us!

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.560
Mm-hmm. Did you
find these weapons

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.160
before or after
you raped the girl?

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.840
Raped?

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.160
I mean--

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.280
<i>That hajji bitch
was all over me.</i>

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.080
What, bombing and shooting them is okay,

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.200
but fucking them
isn't.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.600
I mean,
who-- who says--

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.200
Do you say?

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.400
Who says their pussies
aren't better

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.560
than their
hearts and minds?

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.280
Would you answer
the question, Pratt?

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.480
This is bullshit.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.600
Just a, you know--

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.920
It's
a dog and pony show

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.360
for the folks
back home, right?

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.440
I'm just one of those
bad apples, huh?

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.680
Soldiers
like B.B. Rush and I?

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.560
We're keeping the Arab
scum off your doorstep.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.600
We shouldn't be in here
answering this crap.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.720
Let me tell you
something, sir.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.240
We should be out,
doing our job,

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.000
boots on the ground,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.160
finding the bad guys,

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.360
putting two in the heart
and one in the head,

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.480
keeping America safe

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.840
and making sure
the motherfucker's dead.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.720
You prosecute
guys like us.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.640
You're just aiding
the terrorists.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.320
<i>A quick death...</i>

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.760
<i>is too good
for this brainwashed,</i>

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.400
<i>racist Nazi fuck.</i>

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.840
<i>This stormtrooper needs
to be stripped naked</i>

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.040
<i>and strung up by his feet.</i>

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.560
<i>Then, what's left
of the family--</i>

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.280
<i>you know,
the ones he didn't shoot</i>

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.720
<i>or set on fire--</i>

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.840
<i>the family of that
poor little girl</i>

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.960
<i>should be given
baseball bats,</i>

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.880
<i>white-hot branding irons,</i>

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.120
<i>blow torches,
dull knives, pliers,</i>

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.840
<i>and, of course, rocks,</i>

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.240
<i>and be told
to go to town!</i>

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.200
<i>This is the same monster</i>

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.840
<i>immortalized in every
fucking movie about Vietnam.</i>

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.320
<i>"Let's do the whole
fucking village!"</i>

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.760
<i>You don't see the My Lai
massacre in the movies</i>

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.520
<i>because the truths
of that fascist orgy</i>

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.160
<i>are just too hellish for even
liberal Hollywood to cop to.</i>

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.600
<i>Oh, but that doesn't
stop them</i>

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.360
<i>making another movie
about 9/11</i>

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.720
<i>because an American life
is worth so much more</i>

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.640
<i>than a Vietnamese,
a Palestinian,</i>

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.240
<i>a Lebanese,
or an Iraqi life</i>

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.560
<i>because we
are the uber race.</i>

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.600
<i>Sieg heil, motherfucker!</i>

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.240
Oh. Okay. Okay, that's great.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.480
All right. All right, now--

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.040
Hey, McCoy--
Woman!

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.240
...I'm not
getting your faces.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.400
Come on, I want you
to turn toward me.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400
Come on, come on.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.600
Look in the lens here.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.000
All right, all right,
all right.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.200
Hurry up.
Take your picture.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.400
ALl right, here we go.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.000
Ready? Come on. Face me.
Here we go.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.400
Here we go.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.800
Come on, Judy, look at me.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.560
Here we go. 1, 2--

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.480
No, I got to go
fix my face.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.920
Your-- What?
Your face is fine.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.360
It's just--
I'll fix my lipstick.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.400
It's perfectly fine.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.920
You look great! Judy!

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.120
Okay.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.560
How about a war story?

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.560
Yeah, how about not?

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.640
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.680
There are no war stories.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.960
Tell us a war story.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.480
You don't want to hear
a war story.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.480
Sure we do. Tell us
what you did out there.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.120
Did you kill
anybody?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.400
Come on!
Let's hear one.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.840
Do you want to hear
a war story?

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.920
Absolutely.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.200
Do you really want
to hear a war story?

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.360
Very much so.
Absolutely.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.000
All right. Here's
a war story for you.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.800
Uh...

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.040
when I first went over there,

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.920
to Afghanistan,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.440
I was, uh, I was all amped up
to kill for my country.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.440
I was ready to just kick
some ass, you know?

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.600
Get some licks in for what
they did to the Towers.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.520
Just be a big fucking
war hero.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.320
Right on! Yeah!

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.360
I get over to Iraq,

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.440
and man, it's just--

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.920
it's just a totally
different story.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.800
You grow up really,
really fast over there

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.120
because everything you see,

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.080
everywhere you look
is just death,

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.800
and it's suffering.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.440
And the killing
that I did do,

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.320
it made me sick to my stomach

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.640
because of these smells
and these sounds

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.800
and these images.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.040
I have these-- these
snapshots in my brain

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.320
that are burned
in there forever,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.640
and I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do about them.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.480
And what was I doing there?

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.680
What was I
doing in a country

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.320
that's done nothing
to me?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.200
Just following orders?
Bullshit. Bull shit.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.200
You better have a really
good fucking reason

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.160
for one of your buddies
to die in your arms,

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.760
to be blown up
right in front of you.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.720
A really good
fucking reason.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.280
And I saw some shit
there, man. I just--

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.920
I just don't know how
I'm going to live with.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.800
I went on a raid
in Samarra.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.040
And two men from my unit

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.760
raped and killed
a 15-year-old girl

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.240
and burned her body.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.160
And I didn't do
anything to stop it.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.920
Oh, no.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.440
No, no.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.040
This is a celebration
for a war hero.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.120
Come on, come on.
Celebration!

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.080
To Lawyer McCoy!

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.120
Come on, come on.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.080
And I'm going
to get my picture here.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.960
Okay. Okay. Okay, McCoy.
Here we go.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.640
Look at the camera.
Come on, Judy.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.320
Look at us here.
Here we go.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.440
1, 2, 3--
