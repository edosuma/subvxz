00:00.959 --> 00:02.636
<i>Previously on x company...
Jacques rigaud,</i>

00:02.660 --> 00:04.494
We will execute these prisoners.

00:04.529 --> 00:06.896
One by one
until you step forward.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.970
We have friends. We can keep
you safe. Do you understand?

00:14.005 --> 00:15.872
Your son klaus.
I can have him transferred.

00:15.907 --> 00:18.040
To a canadian pow camp.

00:18.076 --> 00:20.977
Be kind to him. I will.

00:21.012 --> 00:23.212
I meant what I said before, son.

00:23.248 --> 00:27.350
So did i. Krystina.

00:27.385 --> 00:31.254
Aurora, his feelings for you
make you all vulnerable.

00:31.289 --> 00:33.156
End it. Did I tell my father.

00:33.191 --> 00:35.925
About the spies who pretend
to be my friends? Not yet.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.494
We did get the recording.
She knows her husband.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.541
Is working with the allies,
but she's keeping the secret.

00:40.565 --> 00:42.565
Let's hope we don't
need to use it.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.201
They're projecting a surge
in oil production in march?

00:45.236 --> 00:47.904
It's part of a highly
classified project.

00:47.939 --> 00:50.540
Operation marigold.
I'm here to help.

00:50.575 --> 00:52.608
Thank you. Thank his friend.

00:52.644 --> 00:55.611
Let's get to work then.

01:02.787 --> 01:06.522
<i>The days ahead won't be easy,</i>

01:06.558 --> 01:08.724
But our unified resistance
network will.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.860
Become a symbol of strength!

01:10.895 --> 01:13.129
Together we can
get a message out,

01:13.164 --> 01:16.866
Rally all frenchmen to ensure
the next allied invasion.

01:16.901 --> 01:19.202
Is a success.
We can't wait for the allies.

01:19.237 --> 01:21.304
If we hit the bastards now,
others will follow!

01:21.339 --> 01:24.407
That's suicide!
Think of your boy.

01:24.442 --> 01:27.109
There's no future for him unless
we mount an attack right now!

01:27.145 --> 01:29.545
Leave my boy out of this!
Lives were lost.

01:29.581 --> 01:32.548
To get this man here.
Put aside your differences and.

01:32.584 --> 01:34.917
Listen to what he has to say.
And who are you?

01:34.953 --> 01:36.819
Do you know
what happened at dieppe?

01:36.855 --> 01:38.721
The russians bring real men,

01:38.756 --> 01:41.324
Real weapons. Were you there?

01:41.359 --> 01:44.060
Thousands of men cut down
on french soil. For you.

01:44.095 --> 01:46.262
Stalingrad is a long ways away.

01:46.297 --> 01:48.731
You want to wait for the reds,
you might be waiting a while.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.734
Alex, the allies lost
at dieppe because none of us.

01:51.769 --> 01:53.736
Told them about
the guns in the cliffs,

01:53.771 --> 01:56.239
The stones that would stick
their tanks to the beach.

01:56.274 --> 01:58.808
There are
different ways to fight.

01:58.843 --> 02:01.510
Tell them what's coming.
The vichy government's begun.

02:01.546 --> 02:03.512
The transfer of power
to the nazis.

02:03.548 --> 02:05.581
All of france is going
to be occupied.

02:05.617 --> 02:08.184
Has this been confirmed?
Hitler's expected to announce.

02:08.219 --> 02:10.519
It tonight on the radio.
As soon as that happens,

02:10.555 --> 02:12.588
We'll be crushed.

02:12.624 --> 02:15.324
Unless we can look past
our differences,

02:15.360 --> 02:18.461
Our philosophies.
We need to talk to the people!

02:18.496 --> 02:21.764
So we fight with words? Yes!

02:21.799 --> 02:24.700
To unite us.

02:24.736 --> 02:26.936
We build networks,

02:26.971 --> 02:28.938
Fill them with eyes.

02:28.973 --> 02:32.208
We see where the germans are
strong, where they're weak.

02:32.243 --> 02:35.444
Allied and resistance networks,

02:35.480 --> 02:38.547
A free flow of information.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.150
So we know
where to land our blows.

02:41.185 --> 02:43.853
And when to pick up
our guns and fight.

02:43.888 --> 02:46.222
You understand my fellow
comrades won't be.

02:46.257 --> 02:49.225
Easily convinced.
Then convince them, alex.

02:49.260 --> 02:51.961
You didn't run when they did
at the battle of france.

02:51.996 --> 02:54.997
Remind them of that.
Go. Talk to them.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.033
We need you.

02:57.068 --> 03:00.169
I need you.

03:03.007 --> 03:06.943
All right, jacques.

03:11.049 --> 03:14.183
Now, gentlemen and mademoiselle.

03:14.218 --> 03:17.219
Let's talk about how
we're going to do this.

03:24.729 --> 03:27.029
Just don't leave
your coat on the plane.

03:27.065 --> 03:30.199
Don't worry. That microfilm's
worth more than I am.

03:30.234 --> 03:32.335
Nazis running out of oil.
It'll change.

03:32.370 --> 03:35.538
The course of the war. Unless
they pull off operation marigold.

03:35.573 --> 03:38.074
We can't let that happen.
Has mayhew mentioned.

03:38.109 --> 03:41.043
Plans for another
landing in france?

03:41.079 --> 03:44.113
It's a ways off, but...

03:44.148 --> 03:46.282
Right. Need-to-know.

03:47.885 --> 03:52.054
You do remember
I am torture-proof.

03:54.559 --> 03:56.392
I'm gonna need
to stay in contact.

03:56.427 --> 03:58.394
With faber when I return home.

03:58.429 --> 04:00.896
Our protocol's secure.
That's not what I mean.

04:00.932 --> 04:03.232
We've developed a very...
Delicate relationship.

04:03.267 --> 04:05.334
That requires discretion.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.670
I'm gonna need you
to be the middle man.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.672
You want me to pass messages.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.707
Between you and faber?

04:11.743 --> 04:13.843
Off the record.
I don't understand.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.978
Aurora's his handler.

04:16.014 --> 04:18.147
Which is why I don't want her
to feel undermined.

04:18.182 --> 04:20.149
That faber and I
are communicating.

04:20.184 --> 04:23.486
I'm sorry to put you
in this position again,

04:23.521 --> 04:27.123
Where you know more than the
others but I trust you, alfred.

04:27.158 --> 04:29.458
Of course.

04:29.494 --> 04:33.229
<i>Our printing operations.</i>

04:33.264 --> 04:36.732
Are nearly all shut down. Paper
and ink are heavily controlled.

04:36.768 --> 04:38.734
If you list your specific
needs, we may be able.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.803
To drop supplies. We have...
Neil.

04:40.838 --> 04:44.306
Reception committees
in the countryside here, here...

04:44.342 --> 04:47.076
See that man? In the suit?

04:47.111 --> 04:49.745
He keeps touching his hat.

04:53.017 --> 04:56.619
They're signalling each other.
We've got a problem!

04:56.654 --> 04:58.788
What is it? Gestapo. They're
watching the building.

04:58.823 --> 05:02.058
Matthieu! Come on. Let's go.

05:03.895 --> 05:07.630
Go to your hiding place.

05:07.665 --> 05:10.299
Water, biscuits,
flashlight, okay?

05:10.334 --> 05:12.668
Go!

05:12.703 --> 05:14.670
They're waiting for us
to come out the building.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.672
Yeah, charging the apartment
is way more risky.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.685
Than arresting us when we leave.
We're outnumbered.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.143
Is there another way out?
There's a fire escape,

05:21.179 --> 05:23.145
But there is a man
watching the alley.

05:23.181 --> 05:26.215
They may have arrested alex.
Burn them in the bathtub.

05:26.250 --> 05:29.685
If these are faber's men,
he can call them off.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.855
I have papers, and they're
going to be targeting men.

05:32.890 --> 05:34.857
I'll have a better chance
of getting by them.

05:34.892 --> 05:36.859
You can't just walk
into the gestapo office!

05:36.894 --> 05:40.996
I'll find a way.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:52.243 --> 05:54.210
Stop!

05:54.245 --> 05:57.146
Your papers.

05:57.181 --> 05:59.348
Yes, of course.

06:06.357 --> 06:08.390
You don't live here.

06:08.426 --> 06:11.927
No. I was just
checking on my mother.

06:11.963 --> 06:14.697
She's alone and she's very sick.
She's not breathing well so...

06:14.732 --> 06:17.333
I was hoping to get the doctor.

06:17.368 --> 06:19.346
We have orders to detain
anyone leaving this building.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.770
I'm sorry, mademoiselle,
but you'll have to come with me.

06:21.806 --> 06:24.273
One more for the holding area!
Yes, sir.

06:30.882 --> 06:34.416
I'm sorry.

06:34.452 --> 06:37.520
I haven't... I haven't been
feeling well myself.

06:37.555 --> 06:39.555
Go.

06:39.590 --> 06:42.958
I will speak with you after
you return with the doctor.

06:42.994 --> 06:46.662
Thank you.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.407
Franz.

06:58.442 --> 07:01.443
Heil hitler! Heil hitler!

07:01.479 --> 07:04.513
Give us the room.

07:11.355 --> 07:14.323
<i>Herr obergruppenfuhrer.</i>

07:14.358 --> 07:17.159
I thought you'd left for poland.

07:19.096 --> 07:22.932
I've spoken with sabine about
her actions the other night.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.934
You shouldn't be concerned.

07:24.969 --> 07:27.670
You are highly
spoken of back home.

07:27.705 --> 07:30.105
Your work here in france
has not gone unnoticed.

07:30.141 --> 07:33.309
That's kind of you to say.
I've also heard.

07:33.344 --> 07:35.844
How you ensured
the enigma's security,

07:35.880 --> 07:39.682
The day of the misadventure
at dieppe.

07:39.717 --> 07:41.750
Clever.

07:41.786 --> 07:44.620
I work with some very
insightful people.

07:44.655 --> 07:48.524
I'm overseeing a special
project in the east.

07:48.559 --> 07:51.527
We're having trouble
with the local resistance.

07:51.562 --> 07:53.462
And...

07:53.497 --> 07:57.866
I need a man with exceptional
skill to pacify the area.

07:59.203 --> 08:01.870
In the east. In poland, yes.

08:01.906 --> 08:04.340
I have an office in pruszko.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.342
<i>Herr obergruppenfuhrer,
with all due respect,</i>

08:06.377 --> 08:08.644
This might not be an ideal time
for me to step away.

08:08.679 --> 08:11.347
From my responsibilities
here in france.

08:11.382 --> 08:14.817
Your transfer has
already been approved.

08:14.852 --> 08:18.320
As minister of natural
resources, how...?

08:18.356 --> 08:21.657
I pulled strings.

08:21.692 --> 08:23.659
I know it's unorthodox.

08:23.694 --> 08:26.996
But this project is
of special importance to me.

08:27.031 --> 08:31.200
As is keeping my family close.

08:31.235 --> 08:34.903
<i>I'm so sorry, sabine,
but you have.</i>

08:34.938 --> 08:36.905
To call franz right away.
You cannot just.

08:36.941 --> 08:38.907
Come here like this.
I have to meet with him.

08:38.943 --> 08:41.143
In the park across from
his office as soon as possible.

08:41.178 --> 08:44.346
I have company.

08:44.382 --> 08:46.582
Yes, an actual friend.
Imagine that.

08:46.617 --> 08:48.984
Helene!

08:49.020 --> 08:50.986
I thought that was your voice.
Please.

08:51.022 --> 08:53.022
Tell him it's an emergency.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.060
Come in.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.965
Please excuse me for a moment.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I'll be right back. Of course.

09:05.036 --> 09:07.169
Fraulein adler.
Good to see you again.

09:07.204 --> 09:09.371
Please!
We've been bonded by vodka.

09:09.407 --> 09:13.075
Call me heidi.

09:13.110 --> 09:16.478
Is everything all right?
It's a little awkward.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.480
It's my superior at work.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.083
Not only is he being
over attentive,

09:21.118 --> 09:23.886
But... I have a feeling he's...

09:23.921 --> 09:26.655
Hiding something.

09:26.691 --> 09:31.393
We're cataloguing
for the reich and...

09:31.429 --> 09:33.462
Well, I shouldn't say this,

09:33.497 --> 09:35.564
But some paintings
have gone missing.

09:35.599 --> 09:38.534
It's quite stressful. So I've
asked sabine if she could.

09:38.569 --> 09:40.703
Get franz to check up on him.

09:40.738 --> 09:44.606
Well, times like this,
sabine must be.

09:44.642 --> 09:45.652
A very valuable friend.
Yes, very.

09:45.676 --> 09:48.777
I don't want to get
into trouble.

09:48.813 --> 09:52.147
The east is untamed territory.

09:52.183 --> 09:54.683
And I need someone
with your experience.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.152
I do worry how sabine
will feel about moving.

09:57.188 --> 10:01.023
Sabine will benefit by being
closer to her father.

10:01.058 --> 10:05.027
There is a level
of emotional support.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.763
She seems to be missing at home.

10:07.798 --> 10:10.632
Paris holds too many.

10:10.668 --> 10:13.168
Painful memories.

10:13.204 --> 10:16.305
Think of poland
as a new beginning.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.407
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer.</i>

10:18.442 --> 10:21.477
Sorry for interrupting.
Frau faber is on the line.

10:23.814 --> 10:27.549
I will let you
give her the good news.

10:37.828 --> 10:39.795
Help me move the table.

10:46.737 --> 10:49.204
More ss!

10:49.240 --> 10:51.507
Looks like they're working on
an entry plan.

10:57.648 --> 10:59.481
I've been saving these
for an emergency.

10:59.517 --> 11:03.385
I'd say this qualifies.

11:05.189 --> 11:07.890
I finally went to bed
about... Midnight?

11:07.925 --> 11:10.404
But that's early for me... but I
thought I was taking the train.

11:10.428 --> 11:13.028
Back to poland in the morning.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.330
You decided to stay longer?
One day.

11:15.366 --> 11:17.499
As a favour to her father.

11:17.535 --> 11:21.303
He asked me to drop in on her,
see how she was feeling,

11:21.338 --> 11:24.373
Cheer her up a little.
Yes, it's been.

11:24.408 --> 11:26.542
A difficult time for her.
Exactly.

11:26.577 --> 11:29.044
<i>And the obergruppenfuhrer
seems to think.</i>

11:29.079 --> 11:31.480
All she needs is a family
to keep her busy.

11:31.515 --> 11:34.817
I see. It's funny how men.

11:34.852 --> 11:36.819
Always think they know
what's best for a woman.

11:36.854 --> 11:38.754
Sounds like you've met
the men I work with.

11:38.789 --> 11:42.724
In poland, things are
more progressive.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.726
We are free
to make our own rules.

11:44.762 --> 11:47.529
About working, children,

11:47.565 --> 11:49.898
Romance.

11:49.934 --> 11:53.001
If you want something,
all you have to do is take it.

11:53.037 --> 11:55.437
Paradise.

11:58.242 --> 12:01.009
He'll do what you want.

12:01.045 --> 12:04.346
Wonderful! I'm sorry.

12:04.381 --> 12:06.381
I have to get back to...

12:06.417 --> 12:09.384
Get back to work before
my boss notices.

12:12.323 --> 12:15.190
Have a safe trip back to poland.

12:15.226 --> 12:17.392
We should stay in touch.

12:26.637 --> 12:29.204
Conserve your ammo.
Pick your shots.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.206
It's too bad alex isn't here.

12:31.242 --> 12:34.443
He was itching for a fight.
Now we have all the fun.

12:37.748 --> 12:40.549
Walking into my home
and using my wife.

12:40.584 --> 12:42.551
Was not the protocol
we agreed to.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.564
I know, and I'm sorry
but neil and harry are trapped.

12:44.588 --> 12:47.055
By the gestapo
at a meeting on rue du four.

12:47.091 --> 12:49.258
You need to call them off.

12:51.462 --> 12:53.729
Excuse me. Those operations are.

12:53.764 --> 12:55.664
Overseen by my staff.
There are repercussions.

12:55.699 --> 12:58.934
To every action I take.
And actions you don't take.

12:58.969 --> 13:00.869
Harry and neil are
trapped there.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.771
What if your staff
interrogates them?

13:02.806 --> 13:04.673
What if your name comes up?

13:04.708 --> 13:07.009
There's a black market
not far from there.

13:07.044 --> 13:09.011
The back of a pharmacy
on saint-germain.

13:09.046 --> 13:11.013
You could redirect
your men there.

13:11.048 --> 13:13.026
There are 100 black markets
in paris; It's not plausible.

13:13.050 --> 13:16.518
I know it's a lot to ask.
I'll think of something.

13:16.554 --> 13:20.822
This will be the last thing
that I do for you.

13:20.858 --> 13:23.158
We have an agreement.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.694
My father-in-law
requires my services.

13:25.729 --> 13:28.530
I'm relocating to poland.
Poland?

13:28.566 --> 13:30.666
As for your friends,
I'll see what I can do.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.862
They're on the move.

14:02.249 --> 14:05.651
Wait!

14:07.187 --> 14:10.055
They're pulling back!

14:10.090 --> 14:12.291
Looks like he came through.

14:12.326 --> 14:15.694
Looks like the fun'll
have to wait.

14:17.364 --> 14:19.798
<i>It's not a setback,</i>

14:19.833 --> 14:23.335
It's an opportunity.
Operation marigold is based.

14:23.370 --> 14:25.382
In poland. If faber's posted
alongside his father-in-law,

14:25.406 --> 14:27.339
It puts him in a better
position to learn.

14:27.374 --> 14:30.042
Where the refineries are.
Do we have any networks there?

14:30.077 --> 14:33.045
Zero. We have no contact
with local resistance.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.148
That's why
you're going there too.

14:36.183 --> 14:39.017
I'm not sure we can just
follow him there.

14:39.053 --> 14:41.019
I mean, he was
ready to cut ties.

14:41.055 --> 14:42.988
He doesn't call the shots.
All of us? To poland?

14:43.023 --> 14:45.490
How do we explain
french citizens travelling.

14:45.526 --> 14:47.437
Through germany into poland?
I'll reach out to my friend.

14:47.461 --> 14:50.662
At the ministry of transport.
What about rigaud?

14:50.698 --> 14:54.099
What about france? Are we gonna
just turn our back on them?

14:54.134 --> 14:57.069
Rigaud is going to need time
to rally and organize.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.571
Yeah, it'll be even harder
when france is fully occupied.

14:59.606 --> 15:02.674
That is time we do not have. I
cannot leave an asset to slip away.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.944
What if...

15:05.980 --> 15:08.513
No. Harry, what?

15:08.549 --> 15:12.484
I was just thinking...
What would tom say?

15:12.519 --> 15:15.320
He'd say we're
thinking too small.

15:15.356 --> 15:17.756
He'd say what if we could help
spread rigaud's message.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.791
And still get ourselves
into poland?

15:21.495 --> 15:24.329
Today, hitler's speech will be
on national radio.

15:24.365 --> 15:26.999
Compulsory listening.

15:27.034 --> 15:29.668
So what if we could hijack
the signal long enough.

15:29.703 --> 15:32.404
For rigaud to talk instead?

15:32.439 --> 15:35.140
It's faster than church
meetings, faster than leaflets.

15:35.175 --> 15:38.610
Can you really do that?
I would need access to the.

15:38.645 --> 15:40.623
Radio ile-de-france transmitter,
I'd have to wire up a relay.

15:40.647 --> 15:42.892
We'd also need to get our hands
on some broadcast equipment.

15:42.916 --> 15:47.486
It's not impossible. Neil.

15:47.521 --> 15:50.055
Get rigaud to write a speech.

15:50.090 --> 15:52.991
Okay.

15:53.027 --> 15:56.561
We don't know anyone. We don't
know anything about the place.

15:56.597 --> 15:58.563
There's a growing
german community.

15:58.599 --> 16:00.565
A lot of women your age.

16:00.601 --> 16:03.502
It could help
take your mind off things.

16:03.537 --> 16:05.804
I need to think about it first.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.007
He's already arranged
the transfer.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.512
He didn't even ask me as...
As if I didn't even matter.

16:13.547 --> 16:16.648
Sabine.

16:16.683 --> 16:19.985
Maybe it's for the best.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.654
This city, this apartment,

16:22.689 --> 16:25.824
There are
so many painful memories.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.361
Maybe poland can be
a new beginning.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.168
And we get away from them.

16:48.148 --> 16:50.615
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer.</i>

16:50.651 --> 16:52.617
I'm sorry for troubling you
but I know.

16:52.653 --> 16:55.320
You would want to hear this.
Jacques rigaud is in paris.

16:57.357 --> 17:01.026
Rigaud? Good. Arrest him now.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.462
Agents had staked out
the meeting and were prepared.

17:03.497 --> 17:05.630
To raid it
when they were relocated...

17:05.665 --> 17:07.632
By your order.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.801
Do you know why those agents
were relocated?

17:10.838 --> 17:12.971
No.

17:13.006 --> 17:15.807
Bader arrived at the airfield
from berlin this morning?

17:15.843 --> 17:18.510
Yes.
Where was his security detail?

17:18.545 --> 17:20.878
I don't know,

17:20.914 --> 17:22.881
I presumed...

17:22.915 --> 17:25.684
You left him to arrive at an
empty airfield. How do you think.

17:27.855 --> 17:30.322
I don't know.

17:30.357 --> 17:32.324
Hold your report to berlin.
I'll see to it.

17:32.359 --> 17:35.026
That he's captured.
We'll discuss this later.

17:37.698 --> 17:39.831
You were there.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.833
In dieppe.

17:41.869 --> 17:45.003
On the beach?

17:45.038 --> 17:47.339
That's right.

17:47.374 --> 17:49.875
A terrible day.

17:49.910 --> 17:52.544
You lost friends?

17:56.483 --> 18:01.920
I've stopped counting. I had to.

18:06.326 --> 18:08.393
How do you keep going?

18:08.428 --> 18:11.763
Knowing that I don't matter.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.801
No matter what happens to me,

18:16.837 --> 18:18.803
The fight will continue.

18:18.839 --> 18:20.805
Like your friend.

18:20.841 --> 18:24.142
I keep thinking of her voice,

18:24.178 --> 18:26.678
How she sang.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.316
So proud.

18:31.351 --> 18:34.819
So free,

18:34.855 --> 18:37.322
Even in the face of death.

18:37.357 --> 18:40.759
I didn't know her name,

18:40.794 --> 18:43.495
But she reminded me.

18:43.530 --> 18:45.997
That the reason we fight,

18:46.033 --> 18:49.301
The reason our friends fought...

18:51.305 --> 18:53.805
Is bigger than all of us.

18:53.840 --> 18:58.443
I'll let you work.

18:58.478 --> 19:02.280
Neil.

19:02.316 --> 19:05.283
Less than three hours to go.
We gotta get this into place.

19:05.319 --> 19:08.887
I'll be right there.

19:14.394 --> 19:16.661
Her name was miri.

19:34.648 --> 19:37.849
I got your telegram.

19:37.884 --> 19:41.019
I didn't expect to hear from you
until this was all over.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.321
Do you have news?

19:43.357 --> 19:45.824
Is my son all right?

19:45.859 --> 19:48.293
They take good care of him.

19:48.328 --> 19:50.729
But he doesn't like
special treatment.

19:50.764 --> 19:54.933
No. No, he never did.

19:57.537 --> 20:01.506
Why are we here, duncan?
Ernst, i...

20:01.541 --> 20:05.377
I'm sorry to have
to meet like this but...

20:07.547 --> 20:10.415
I'm afraid I need
your help one more time.

20:10.450 --> 20:13.585
I appreciate your retrieving
my son from siberia,

20:13.620 --> 20:16.521
But I hadn't foreseen you taking
that as licence to keep coming.

20:16.556 --> 20:18.857
To me for favours.
It's not like that at all.

20:18.892 --> 20:21.359
Yeah.

20:21.395 --> 20:23.928
What is it you want?

20:23.964 --> 20:29.034
So the paris receiver
picks up the berlin signal.

20:29.069 --> 20:31.369
And transmits it
to everybody within range.

20:31.405 --> 20:34.873
You sure you know
what you're doing?

20:34.908 --> 20:37.053
Once we start broadcasting,
this repeater I'm splicing in.

20:37.077 --> 20:39.044
Will take over
hitler's airwaves.

20:39.079 --> 20:43.048
This station transmitter is so
powerful, they will probably.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.483
Hear the message in england!

20:48.922 --> 20:51.256
Jesus! That's fine.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.693
Wait.

20:54.728 --> 20:57.762
No, it's fine.
So how do we send out.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.099
Rigaud's voice and not just
a bunch of dots and dashes?

21:01.134 --> 21:03.902
That van on the way in?

21:03.937 --> 21:06.304
It's basically
a rolling radio station,

21:06.340 --> 21:08.318
So what we have to do is
break in, steal the microphone.

21:08.342 --> 21:10.308
And transmitter inside.

21:10.344 --> 21:13.678
Or we just steal the van?

21:13.714 --> 21:15.680
Direction-finding teams.

21:15.716 --> 21:17.794
Will have a much harder time
tracking us if we're moving.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.019
Steal a radio station van,
drive around the city.

21:21.054 --> 21:23.166
Broadcasting a resistance call
to arms with nazis on our tail?

21:23.190 --> 21:25.156
Yeah, I know.

21:25.192 --> 21:27.826
Sinclair's going
to hate it, isn't he?

21:27.861 --> 21:29.861
It's bloody brilliant is
what it is.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.164
Jacques rigaud.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.867
Come with me.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.053
It's short notice.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.188
But there is a supply train
leaving tomorrow.

22:22.223 --> 22:25.692
That goes to poland. Rations
for the troops in the east.

22:25.727 --> 22:28.695
I...

22:28.730 --> 22:30.697
I can ensure that...

22:30.732 --> 22:33.199
One car is empty
and won't be checked.

22:33.234 --> 22:37.003
When you get the details,
send a telegram.

22:37.038 --> 22:39.038
To the return address.
We'll take it from there.

22:39.074 --> 22:41.474
Ernst, thank you.

22:41.509 --> 22:43.810
Take care.

22:43.845 --> 22:46.646
Duncan.

22:46.681 --> 22:50.083
I need something to tell greta.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.985
She's been worried about klaus.

22:53.021 --> 22:56.022
We've written to him
via the royal care society.

22:56.057 --> 22:59.692
But he hasn't written back.
He's at an officer's camp.

22:59.728 --> 23:03.996
He's treated fairly.
Have you actually seen him?

23:04.032 --> 23:07.934
I did, ernst. I got a chance
to visit him, yes.

23:07.969 --> 23:11.537
How was he? He was well.

23:15.043 --> 23:19.045
You remember that summer we
taught the boys to play chess?

23:19.080 --> 23:22.515
Yeah. Can I ask you a favour?

23:22.550 --> 23:25.518
If you could get him a set,

23:25.553 --> 23:28.521
I'm sure it would help
keep his mind off things.

23:28.556 --> 23:31.724
Until this is all over.

23:36.064 --> 23:38.064
Leave it to me.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.636
I know the shame.

23:43.671 --> 23:45.938
He must be feeling
as a prisoner.

23:45.974 --> 23:48.141
So, please, duncan,

23:48.176 --> 23:50.143
When you see him,

23:50.178 --> 23:53.880
Let him know
that I'm very proud of him.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.849
And that his mother
loves him very much.

23:59.754 --> 24:02.421
I admire your courage, duncan.

24:02.457 --> 24:04.991
The war has taken
your elder son;

24:05.026 --> 24:07.093
William is still missing.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.331
It seems unfair that...

24:12.367 --> 24:15.368
My son is given all this luxury.

24:18.540 --> 24:22.041
I can't thank you enough
for what you have done.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.550
What is it? What's wrong?

24:33.721 --> 24:36.522
It's klaus.

24:36.558 --> 24:40.059
Duncan, what is it
you're not telling me?

24:48.002 --> 24:50.303
Ernst, your son...

24:50.338 --> 24:52.471
Died in the line of duty.

24:52.507 --> 24:55.641
What are you saying?

24:55.677 --> 24:58.477
He tried to destroy.

24:58.513 --> 25:00.980
Our communications
and assassinate me.

25:01.015 --> 25:03.049
But he was stopped.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.552
Stopped? He was killed, ernst.

25:06.588 --> 25:10.489
You killed him?
He had the bomb in his hands.

25:10.525 --> 25:12.992
It was a suicide mission.

25:13.027 --> 25:15.261
You gave me your word!
You promised he'd be safe!

25:17.265 --> 25:19.632
He made his own decision. I...
There was nothing I could do.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.235
And you come here
asking me for favours?

25:22.270 --> 25:25.438
What kind of man does that?

25:30.211 --> 25:33.679
Where is he? Ernst.

25:33.715 --> 25:36.616
Where is his body?
What did you do with his body?

25:39.721 --> 25:41.921
There was nothing I could do.

25:46.494 --> 25:49.362
I'm sorry, ernst.

26:16.524 --> 26:18.991
What is all this?

26:19.027 --> 26:21.360
I understand
you're relocating to poland.

26:21.396 --> 26:23.340
<i>Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt
has asked me to start packing.</i>

26:23.364 --> 26:25.965
For you. I hope that's fine.
Jacques rigaud.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.968
Has been arrested. No one is to interrogate
him before he's sent to berlin.

26:29.003 --> 26:30.903
How did you
secure him so quickly?

26:30.939 --> 26:33.506
Some informants are
best kept quiet.

26:35.543 --> 26:37.576
I am honoured
to have worked with you.

26:37.612 --> 26:40.746
And I wish you good luck in poland
and I hope that your replacement,

26:40.782 --> 26:43.916
<i>Herr oberfuhrer fischer,
will treat me as patiently.</i>

26:43.952 --> 26:46.552
<i>We should never
have trusted faber!</i>

26:46.587 --> 26:49.422
He came to our home.
I say we go to his,

26:49.457 --> 26:51.268
Get his wife to call him
with a gun to her head.

26:51.292 --> 26:54.138
Neil, that will only burn what we've built.
He's valuable to us in poland.

26:54.162 --> 26:57.263
We need to keep our eyes on the bigger
picture. Well, we can't stay here.

26:57.298 --> 27:01.167
This safe house is blown. If faber wanted
to arrest all of us, he would have.

27:01.202 --> 27:04.837
He left a note, which means he's willing
to talk. Maybe he's open to negotiating.

27:04.872 --> 27:06.806
Or maybe that's
an invitation to an ambush.

27:06.841 --> 27:09.241
He's trying to tie up loose ends
before heading to poland.

27:09.277 --> 27:11.422
I don't like it either, but
if there's a chance to bargain.

27:11.446 --> 27:14.580
For rigaud, we take it.
What about transport.

27:14.615 --> 27:17.817
To poland? How did things go
with your contact?

27:19.654 --> 27:21.620
We need to find another way.

27:23.658 --> 27:26.392
Let's just focus on getting
rigaud back, please.

27:33.201 --> 27:36.802
We need rigaud back, unharmed.
You come to my home.

27:36.838 --> 27:39.505
Involve my wife.
Pull me from my work.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.774
You fail to mention
that the most wanted man.

27:41.809 --> 27:43.876
In france was present
at a meeting I protected.

27:43.911 --> 27:45.978
We didn't owe you
that information.

27:46.014 --> 27:48.381
You made a commitment not
to compromise my credibility.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.194
You failed. I will not risk
getting shot for treason.

27:50.218 --> 27:52.651
Because your word
cannot be trusted.

27:52.687 --> 27:55.855
You called this meeting.
You want something.

27:55.890 --> 27:58.224
My colleagues in berlin want
to interrogate rigaud.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.359
Themselves. This is in
neither of our interests.

28:00.395 --> 28:02.294
I will allow him to escape.

28:02.330 --> 28:05.064
Good.
In exchange, I will no longer.

28:05.099 --> 28:09.535
Work as a double agent.
We will sever all ties.

28:12.407 --> 28:14.774
Understood.

28:18.346 --> 28:22.848
Thanks. Less than an hour.

28:22.884 --> 28:26.385
Until the speech. We'll make it.

28:34.862 --> 28:37.496
I'm sorry about miri.

28:37.532 --> 28:41.033
She's...

28:41.069 --> 28:44.470
She was... Yeah, she was.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.607
Make sure everything's
ready to go.

28:48.643 --> 28:51.243
I'll check we've got enough gas.

29:06.894 --> 29:10.863
If you don't mind my saying,

29:10.898 --> 29:12.698
You don't look well.

29:12.733 --> 29:15.134
You look like I did.

29:15.169 --> 29:18.003
When your soldiers
invaded my village.

29:20.041 --> 29:23.476
I swore I would die
protecting what I love.

29:23.511 --> 29:27.346
But they took that from me too?

29:29.350 --> 29:32.151
I rotted in a cell for weeks.

29:32.186 --> 29:35.087
Before I worked up the courage.

29:35.123 --> 29:37.890
Then I woke up in a hospital.

29:37.925 --> 29:41.594
Apparently it was
a miracle I survived.

29:41.629 --> 29:45.164
The nurse that helped me escape.

29:45.199 --> 29:47.166
Said she wanted
to do something good.

29:49.770 --> 29:52.271
This has nothing to do with me.

29:52.306 --> 29:55.007
I should be dead,

29:55.042 --> 29:58.010
So the time I have now...

29:58.045 --> 30:00.012
It's a bonus.

30:00.047 --> 30:03.682
And it's not mine to keep.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.851
I was thinking.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.120
About how you arrested me.

30:08.156 --> 30:10.523
How you knew exactly
where I'd be.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.758
How you came alone.

30:12.793 --> 30:15.995
Like you were
protecting something.

30:16.030 --> 30:19.064
You're a perceptive man.

30:22.069 --> 30:26.038
I think you also want to do
something good.

30:30.511 --> 30:32.511
Stop the truck!

30:50.431 --> 30:52.398
I was right.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.001
You're working with them!
Why do you believe that?

30:56.037 --> 30:58.504
Because I'm not
on a plane to berlin.

31:09.250 --> 31:12.718
Go. Thank you.

31:24.065 --> 31:26.599
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer!</i>

31:26.634 --> 31:28.601
The death of this terrorist.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.603
Will do more to destabilize
the resistance.

31:30.638 --> 31:33.572
Than any intelligence
he could offer to berlin.

31:33.608 --> 31:35.541
But our orders...
Our superiors do not.

31:35.576 --> 31:37.543
Understand the situation
in france.

31:37.578 --> 31:39.545
They are not here on the ground.

31:39.580 --> 31:42.081
I did not rise to my rank
by playing by the rules.

31:42.116 --> 31:44.083
This is something
you will come to understand.

31:44.118 --> 31:46.318
As you advance your career.

31:46.354 --> 31:49.154
You are a very promising
young officer, edsel,

31:49.190 --> 31:51.190
And I would like
to continue to see you rise.

31:51.225 --> 31:53.993
For that to happen,
our relationship needs.

31:54.028 --> 31:58.030
To be one built on trust.
Of course.

31:58.065 --> 32:00.366
You will be held
responsible for this.

32:00.401 --> 32:03.769
The prisoner fled
under your watch. However,

32:03.804 --> 32:06.171
You will receive full credit
for the prevention.

32:06.207 --> 32:08.507
Of his escape,
and I will protect you.

32:08.542 --> 32:11.243
From any punishment.
Are you with me?

32:11.279 --> 32:14.246
In return,

32:14.282 --> 32:16.849
I will bring you to poland.
You will continue.

32:16.884 --> 32:19.685
To learn from me. You will rise
faster than you ever thought.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.788
Is that satisfactory?

32:22.823 --> 32:25.524
Yes.

32:25.559 --> 32:28.460
<i>Yes, herr brigadefuhrer.</i>

32:42.377 --> 32:45.311
I think this is
actually gonna to work.

32:45.346 --> 32:48.481
What?

32:48.516 --> 32:51.851
What's happened?

32:51.886 --> 32:55.955
Rigaud's body was found.
Was it faber?

32:55.990 --> 32:58.324
We don't know what happened.
Was it faber?

32:58.359 --> 33:00.626
He was shot trying to escape,
neil. That's all we know.

33:00.662 --> 33:02.628
I'm so sorry.

33:02.664 --> 33:05.865
That's that, then?

33:05.900 --> 33:09.135
He was a good man
and a great leader.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.404
Now, we still have
his plans and his contacts.

33:11.439 --> 33:13.372
The bso will work
with the resistance.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.374
Your next move is
operation marigold.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.376
Of course, yeah.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.412
Run away? Move along.

33:20.715 --> 33:24.050
Rene. We left him behind.

33:24.085 --> 33:28.387
Tom too. And miri.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.389
'Cause that's what we do!
We use them up,

33:30.425 --> 33:33.559
And then we're on to the next
move. Well, who's next?

33:33.595 --> 33:35.862
Jacques rigaud was the point.

33:35.897 --> 33:38.965
Of the radio operation, neil.
He's gone. It's over.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.842
I'll update the brits and
the americans about marigold.

33:49.878 --> 33:53.679
You need to get to poland.
What about faber?

33:53.715 --> 33:56.182
It's time to play our card.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.592
Rigaud's not the point.

34:06.628 --> 34:10.295
He doesn't matter.
He said so himself.

34:10.331 --> 34:12.297
This isn't about him.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.300
It's about the message.

34:14.335 --> 34:18.070
It's about carrying on the
fight. Harry's all set to go.

34:18.106 --> 34:20.273
Hitler's speech is
about to start.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.341
We can still do this.

34:36.424 --> 34:38.591
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer,</i>

34:38.626 --> 34:41.561
It's almost time.

34:41.596 --> 34:43.763
Right.

34:43.797 --> 34:45.831
Do you mind?

34:45.867 --> 34:49.068
That is, I don't have a radio.

34:49.103 --> 34:52.103
Of course, matthias.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.373
Thank you.

35:26.708 --> 35:30.376
I'll dispatch the radio teams.

35:30.411 --> 35:33.713
If they're broadcasting locally,
we'll find them right away.

35:33.748 --> 35:36.148
Go!

35:48.663 --> 35:50.663
I'm speaking to you now.

35:50.698 --> 35:52.832
Because it's time
you knew the truth.

35:52.867 --> 35:55.501
France will soon be entirely.

35:55.536 --> 35:57.870
Under german occupation.

36:12.220 --> 36:15.488
Their victory depends
entirely on you.

36:18.593 --> 36:23.062
We are closing in.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.698
Wait! The signal is moving.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.733
Northeast!

36:27.769 --> 36:30.569
We can be broken
and taught to hate.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.205
But together, when we lock arms,

36:33.241 --> 36:36.342
We are a force
they cannot imagine.

36:36.377 --> 36:39.412
We are...

36:43.017 --> 36:45.818
We are...

36:45.853 --> 36:49.522
A light that will
push back the darkness.

36:54.228 --> 36:56.329
We have 100,000 eyes.

36:56.364 --> 36:58.998
Watching their every move.

36:59.033 --> 37:03.069
100,000 ears listening
to their plans.

37:15.283 --> 37:18.517
One for the moon.

37:18.553 --> 37:22.088
They will see
that we are unstoppable.

37:33.935 --> 37:35.901
They've stopped. Up ahead!

38:11.456 --> 38:14.290
And you shot him in the back.
Rigaud knew I was working.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.792
With you. He was about
to be interrogated. I did.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.961
What I had to do
in order to protect us both.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.896
And you want me
to take that on faith?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.910
Take it how you like.
Our obligations to each other.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.968
Are now over. Not necessarily.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.738
Your father-in-law is
working on a top secret project.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.073
Called operation marigold.
How do you know this?

38:31.109 --> 38:33.776
We broke into his briefcase
at your party.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.679
We think that operation marigold
is a new, bigger oil refinery.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.082
In poland capable
of pushing oil production.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.252
Through the roof and
guaranteeing a nazi victory.

38:43.287 --> 38:46.856
Franz, I need you
to help me find it.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.858
Why would I do that?
You spoke to me once.

38:48.893 --> 38:52.194
About ending the cruelty
and the death camps.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.965
I'm offering you a chance
to help end this war.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.268
No more secrets.
No hidden agendas.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.504
We stay in contact
after I leave.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.439
It's tempting
but I can't take that risk.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.374
Good luck to your team.

39:05.410 --> 39:09.011
In the spirit
of complete honesty, franz...

39:09.047 --> 39:11.781
<i>Did I tell my father
about the spies.</i>

39:11.816 --> 39:13.749
<i>Who pretend to be my friends,</i>

39:13.785 --> 39:15.685
<i>Come to my home
and follow me in the streets?</i>

39:15.720 --> 39:19.221
<i>Not yet.</i>

39:19.257 --> 39:22.124
You will help us in poland.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.627
The minute one of my agents
fails to report in,

39:24.662 --> 39:27.096
This recording goes public.

39:34.338 --> 39:37.373
There's an update.
You're going to poland.

39:37.408 --> 39:39.842
We've got a forger who can get
papers for the boys,

39:39.877 --> 39:42.078
And faber's back on board.
How'd he take it?

39:42.113 --> 39:44.313
How would you take it?
It was better.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.816
When we had him on principle.
We still do. The blackmail's.

39:46.851 --> 39:49.518
Just a guarantee.
If he's working against.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.887
His will, how can we trust him?
We have to trust.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.856
That he loves his wife
more than he hates us.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.492
Aurora, the minute
you're on that train,

39:56.527 --> 39:58.527
You become helene bauer
full time.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.730
And it is not going to be easy.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.998
Helene and I get along.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.167
You will feel alone.
You will do things.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.236
And say things
that you don't want to.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.405
But you've got to keep your eye
on the bigger picture.

40:09.440 --> 40:13.175
Marigold.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.277
I've got a plane to catch.
Raise a glass for me.

40:15.313 --> 40:19.381
I will.
And did you speak to alfred?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.984
Get it done.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.088
Good luck.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.329
Well done, you bastard.

40:41.472 --> 40:44.306
Hey, you all right?

40:44.342 --> 40:48.177
Um, yeah.

40:50.548 --> 40:52.915
Just something
I should have said before.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.488
That time, that, um...

40:59.524 --> 41:02.057
That kiss.

41:02.093 --> 41:06.462
Yeah? It was a mistake.

41:06.497 --> 41:10.499
I... it was a mistake.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.703
Is this sinclair talking? No.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.508
Alfred,

41:19.544 --> 41:21.577
Look at me.

41:21.612 --> 41:24.647
I am.

41:24.682 --> 41:28.951
Believe me. I do.

41:28.986 --> 41:32.488
I don't feel for you
the way I felt for rene.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.625
Here's a bit of good news.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.828
I've found the perfect way
to unburden us from some.

41:38.863 --> 41:41.163
Of sinclair's
freshly delivered francs.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.599
Hang on. How old are you?

41:43.634 --> 41:46.368
Really, grandpa?

41:46.404 --> 41:49.672
Like I haven't heard
that one before.

41:49.707 --> 41:53.676
How about a toast?
To absent friends.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.048
Jacques rigaud, rene,

41:59.083 --> 42:01.817
Tom,

42:01.853 --> 42:04.286
Miri.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.323
To the love they left behind.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.594
Cheers.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.970
Oooh! "Oooh" is right.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.807
Hairs on your chest.
Or your shoulder.

42:24.842 --> 42:27.209
I have a task.

42:29.013 --> 42:32.348
I need you to search the camp
rolls for pows in the pacific.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.416
<i>The pacific, herr brigadefuhrer?</i>

42:34.452 --> 42:36.585
I'm searching for a canadian.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.990
William sinclair.
