WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:05.879
Mel: LENNOX,

00:05.880 --> 00:07.919
YOU WANT TO DO SOME REALITY
TV BINGING WITH ME?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.379
I WAS THINKING WE'D START
WITH THE KARDASHIANS,

00:09.380 --> 00:11.419
INTO NAKED BEVERLY HILLS,
INTO PREGNANT GRANDMAS.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.999
AND THEN, CAP IT ALL OFF
WITH ADORABLE ANIMAL FRIENDS

00:14.000 --> 00:15.419
SO WE DON'T DWELL ON THE
DOWNFALL OF HUMANITY.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.459
AUNT MEL, I CAN'T. OKAY?

00:17.460 --> 00:19.619
I'M TOO BUSY COORDINATING THE NEXT
SHOOT FOR THE CASSANDRA MOVIE.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.959
IS EVERYTHING OKAY? YOUR
TYPING SOUNDS VERY ANGRY.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.209
(scoffs) WELL, HONESTLY
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

00:24.210 --> 00:26.169
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH SHOOTING
THE MOVIE AND ZANDER IS STILL

00:26.170 --> 00:29.079

00:29.080 --> 00:31.379
(chuckles) BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT, I AM SO OVER IT.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.580
(pounds keys) I DO NOT CARE.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.120
THE MORE YOU SAY IT, THE
MORE I BELIEVE YOU.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.749
HEY THERE, I'M BACK.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.119

(normal voice) YOU SAY IT LIKE
THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALL CAPS

00:50.540 --> 00:51.790
WITH A LITTLE EXCLAMATION POINT.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.999

WELL AND I GOT THE JOB.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.039

WAIT, 3:30 AM?

01:19.170 --> 01:23.289
YEAH, STRANGELY ENOUGH, THE MORNING
SHOW IS SHOT ENTIRELY IN THE MORNING.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.119
ANYWAY, IT GOES ON LIVE AT FIVE.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.419
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM, IS IT?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.459
WELL, (scoffs)

01:27.460 --> 01:28.709
OF COURSE NOT.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.540
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOOD
FOR YOU IS GOOD FOR ME.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.209

01:34.210 --> 01:36.329
OH, THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE!
SAVE THE VALUABLES!

01:36.330 --> 01:38.379
THE HOUSE IS NOT ON FIRE, HONEY.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.419

01:39.420 --> 01:40.999
IT'S MY FIRST DAY AT WORK.

OH. OH, THANK GOD.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.790
WELL, I WAS ALSO GOING

03:21.000 --> 03:23.119
In fact, I'm stoked.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.329
This is who I am, Sergio.

03:36.330 --> 03:39.459
Either accept it, or go find
yourself a new girlfriend.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.120
(chuckles)

03:42.170 --> 03:43.329
I HAVE TO SAY, MCKENNA...

03:43.330 --> 03:45.289
SORRY, CASSANDRA,

03:45.290 --> 03:47.379
OUR MOVIE'S TOTALLY
COMING TOGETHER.

03:47.380 --> 03:49.119
YOU GAVE A GREAT
PERFORMANCE IN THAT SCENE.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.169
THAT WAS A TOUR-DE-FORCE.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.539
I KNOW, THANKS.

03:51.540 --> 03:54.119
I MEAN, IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.540
OR WHATEVER.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.289

03:59.290 --> 04:02.039
OH, OKAY. WELL, WE'LL BE

04:02.040 --> 04:04.079
YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN
RUN A FEW SCENES.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.749
DO A LITTLE IMPROV.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.209
- OH.

04:07.210 --> 04:08.619
OKAY.

04:08.620 --> 04:12.040
(giggles)

04:13.250 --> 04:15.040
(sighs) IMPROV IS CODE FOR SEX.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.750
IT'S NOT CODE IF YOU EXPLAIN IT.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.749
- HEY!
- HEY!

04:23.750 --> 04:25.209
THERE HE IS.

04:25.210 --> 04:28.169
THE WORLD'S MOST ATTRACTIVE
TV CORRESPONDENT.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.249
WELL, OTHER THAN
ANDERSON COOPER.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.379
THERE HE IS!

04:31.380 --> 04:35.120
THE WORLD'S MOST ATTRACTIVE,
HETEROSEXUAL TV CORRESPONDENT.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.789
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU
IT FELT GREAT TO BE ABLE

04:37.790 --> 04:39.169
TO CONNECT WITH SO
MANY PEOPLE AT ONCE.

04:39.170 --> 04:40.499
SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE SEGMENT?

04:40.500 --> 04:41.789
AWESOME.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.419
SO AWESOME.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.079
I MEAN, WORDS CANNOT
DESCRIBE THE AWESOMENESS.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.880
YOU DIDN'T WATCH IT, DID YOU?

04:49.040 --> 04:51.000
WELL, NOT WITH MY EYES
BUT WITH MY HEART.

04:52.210 --> 04:55.039
IT'S ON SO EARLY. I PROMISE
I'LL WATCH TOMORROW.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.499
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.830
DINNER'S ON.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.209
WHERE'S YOUR PLATE?

05:00.210 --> 05:02.249
OH, UM, I ATE AT THREE.
I HAVE TO HIT THE SACK.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.119
IT'S NOT EVEN DARK OUT AND
THE MAIL HASN'T COME YET.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.329
I HAVE TO GET TO BED EARLY. COME ON, I HAVE
TO BE THERE AT 3:30 IN THE MORNING AGAIN.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.669
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU ALL DAY,

05:10.670 --> 05:13.710
AND I HAVE OTHER NEEDS
BESIDES MY NEED FOR FOOD.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.879
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.880
I'LL THROW YOU ONE.

05:21.710 --> 05:24.210
SO, I JUST GOT THE
ODDEST EMAIL FROM IVANA.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.329
SHE WANTS ME TO ADD
MORE CASSANDRA SCENES.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.709
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY SHE'D WANT TO DO THAT.

05:29.710 --> 05:30.710
CAN YOU?

05:31.830 --> 05:34.619
YOU KNOW, I'LL BET IT'S
BECAUSE CASSANDRA,

05:34.620 --> 05:36.379
THAT BRILLIANT
CREATION OF YOURS,

05:36.380 --> 05:38.619
IS A MULTI-LAYERED CHARACTER AND
WE HAVEN'T EVEN REALLY BEGUN

05:38.620 --> 05:39.749
MINING HER TRUE POTENTIAL.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.289
HUH.

05:41.290 --> 05:44.380
THAT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE IVANA
USED THE EXACT SAME WORDS.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
GREAT MINDS.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.919
OH, PLEASE.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.419
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO
PUT OFF THE INEVITABLE.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.289
CASSANDRA TURNING
BACK INTO MCKENNA.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.789
(scoffs) THIS ISN'T
ABOUT ME AND CASSANDRA.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.249
THIS IS ABOUT MINING
CASSANDRA'S TRUE CHARACTER.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.209
YOU KNOW, DELVING DEEP,
DEEP INSIDE HER.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.170
TAPPING HER, EVERY BIT OF HER.

06:02.170 --> 06:03.170
OKAY, STOP.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.039
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
YOU TAPPING CASSANDRA.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.499
I'LL JUST WRITE MORE SCENES.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.209
THANK YOU.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.500
ON BEHALF OF IVANA.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.999
WELL, AT LEAST YOUR JOB DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE AFFECTING OUR ROMANCE.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.379
HONEY, NOTHING IS EVER GOING
TO AFFECT OUR ROMANCE.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.879
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE WE ARE HOT.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.919
HOT.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.959
- (Mel giggles)
- HOT.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.619
(Joe giggles) SEE YA.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.789
WAIT, WHAT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:26.790 --> 06:29.119
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
SLEEP IN MY OLD ROOM.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.039
WHAT IS THIS, SOPHOMORE YEAR OF COLLEGE?
I WANTED TO SPOON.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.169
NO, HONEY, LOOK,

06:33.170 --> 06:35.499
I DON'T WANT YOU WAKING ME
UP WHEN YOU GET IN BED,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.079
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE YOU
UP WHEN I GET OUT OF BED.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.170
YOU KNOW? IT'S REALLY THE
BEST THING FOR BOTH OF US.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.669
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF CHEAP BOOTY CALL.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.419
WHAT? COME ON. OF
COURSE I'M NOT.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.749
NO, HONEY.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.289
YOU'RE MY BOOTY FOR LIFE.

06:49.290 --> 06:52.289
YOU KNOW? YOU'RE MY PERMA-BOOTY.

06:52.290 --> 06:53.879
(chuckles) YOU'RE MY, UH...

06:53.880 --> 06:55.379
MY BOOTY AND CHAIN.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.249
(chuckles) NO, I LOVE YOU.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.919
HEY, LOOK, THIS WAS, UH...

06:58.920 --> 06:59.959
THIS WAS...

06:59.960 --> 07:01.209
THIS WAS NICE.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.290
I'LL TEXT YOU.

07:03.830 --> 07:04.830
WHAT?

07:04.831 --> 07:06.289
THAT CAME OUT SO WRONG.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.919
THAT ISN'T EVEN WHAT I MEANT.
WHAT I MEANT WAS...

07:07.920 --> 07:09.919
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
ALL RIGHT?

07:09.920 --> 07:11.379
HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT,

07:11.380 --> 07:12.959
YOU CAN HAVE MY GOOD PILLOW.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.169
WHY DON'T YOU SPOON WITH THAT?

07:14.170 --> 07:16.750
IT SMELLS LIKE ME, WHICH IS, YOU
KNOW, WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.879
NOPE, CAN'T DO IT.
SORRY, SWEETIE.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.880
GOTTA HAVE MY GOOD PILLOW.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.329
WHEW, IT'S BACK! OKAY.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.040
I LOVE YOU. NIGHT.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.919
HI, HONEY.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
HEY.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.499
IT'S 2:45, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING UP?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.079
WELL, I REALIZED THAT IF I WANT
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU,

07:41.080 --> 07:42.289
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE SOME SACRIFICES.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.879
BUT, IT'S WORTH IT IF I GET TO SPEND
SOME QUALITY TIME WITH MY MAN.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.620
AW, THANK YOU, HONEY.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.669
I GOT TO GO.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.709

07:50.710 --> 07:52.119
YEAH, I HAVE TO BE IN
EXTRA EARLY TODAY.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.579
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.830
I MEAN, IF IT WAS ANY EARLIER,
IT WOULD BE YESTERDAY.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.079
WHAT CAN I SAY? I HAVE TO STOP
AT THE MARKET ON MY WAY IN.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.079
I'M DOING A SEGMENT TODAY ON HOW
TO WORKOUT WITH A WATERMELON.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.169
IT'S CALLED, "LIFT
IT, THEN EAT IT."

08:04.170 --> 08:07.119
YEAH, IT'S FROM A FARM
TO TABLE TO MOUTH

08:07.120 --> 08:08.210

08:09.750 --> 08:11.079
LOVE YOU. SEE YA.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.249
YEAH, SEE YA.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.210
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.120

08:17.790 --> 08:19.669
HEY, I GOT YOUR TEXT

08:19.670 --> 08:22.249
THAT YOU FINISHED THE CASSANDRA SCENES.
HAND THEM OVER.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.750
YOU WROTE THOSE IN RECORD TIME.

08:24.830 --> 08:27.249
LET'S JUST SAY I WAS INSPIRED.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.670
WELL, THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

08:29.670 --> 08:32.499
FOR IVANA, 'CAUSE IVANA
THINKS IT'LL BE A GOOD MOVE.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.579
I MEAN, THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE
AMOUNT OF STORIES THAT WE CAN TELL

08:35.580 --> 08:38.249
ABOUT THIS CHARACTER. I MEAN,
NOTHING CAN STOP CASSANDRA.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.040
YOU KILLED CASSANDRA?

08:41.670 --> 08:42.959
YEP.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.169
AND WHO KNEW HOW FUN IT IS
TO WRITE A DEATH SCENE?

08:45.170 --> 08:48.080
I MEAN, IT'S NO WONDER GEORGE R.
R. MARTIN IS ALWAYS SMILING.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.289
IVANA'S GONNA HATE THIS.

08:50.290 --> 08:54.209
YEAH, WELL, IVANA READ IT
AND SENT ME THIS TEXT:

08:54.210 --> 08:57.750
"GREAT ENDING. I LOVE A GOOD DEATH SCENE.
DON'T CHANGE A WORD."

08:59.170 --> 09:00.960
THERE'S MANY WAYS
TO INTERPRET THAT.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.579
ADMIT IT, THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANTED ME TO WRITE MORE

09:04.580 --> 09:07.379
WAS SO YOU COULD KEEP YOUR SHAM
RELATIONSHIP WITH MCKENNA GOING.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.249
YOU'RE DATING A CHARACTER.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.919
OKAY, WHEN THE FILM WRAPS,

09:10.920 --> 09:12.669
MCKENNA'S GONNA GO BACK TO BEING
THE SAME BUBBLY CHEERLEADER

09:12.670 --> 09:14.790
WHO SAID HER FAVORITE
COLOR IS GLITTER.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.249
(scoffs)

09:17.250 --> 09:18.250
SO?

09:19.460 --> 09:20.749
GLITTER IS BEAUTIFUL.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.710
AND IT NEVER, EVER GOES AWAY.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.170
WHO DOESN'T LOVE GLITTER?

09:26.420 --> 09:29.459
MCKENNA WANTED TO GO TO THE
ZOO TO PET THE UNICORN.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.209
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES
IN BEAUTIFUL MAGIC.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.710
IS THAT SO WRONG?

09:38.170 --> 09:39.170
MAN!

09:40.210 --> 09:42.790
I CANNOT WAIT TO CRASH OUT.
I'M TELLING YOU.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.119
7:15! WHAT AM I STILL DOING UP?
HONEY?

09:46.120 --> 09:48.459
I GOT TO GO TO BED RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS ME KISSING YOU GOOD NIGHT.

09:48.460 --> 09:49.460
MWAH!

09:52.460 --> 09:53.460
WHOA.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.420
SOMEONE GOT A DATE?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.829
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

09:57.830 --> 10:00.039
THE CAMPAIGN INVESTOR
IS COMING OVER TONIGHT

10:00.040 --> 10:01.209
TO DECIDE IF HE'S
GONNA GIVE ME MONEY.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.749
OH, YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

10:02.750 --> 10:03.879
FOR YOUR CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.579
EXPLORATORY CAMPAIGN.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.289
WELL, WISH ME LUCK.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.379
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT. I THOUGHT
THAT HE WANTED TO MEET BOTH OF US.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.879
YOU KNOW, TO SEE IF WE HAD WHAT IT
TOOK TO BE AN ELECTABLE POWER COUPLE.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.169
WELL, YEAH, JOE. BUT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO FALL ASLEEP.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.829
NO, I'M GONNA SPLASH
SOME WATER ON MY FACE

10:15.830 --> 10:17.709
AND I'M GONNA WAKE UP BECAUSE
I NEED TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.379
- (doorbell rings)
- OH, THAT'S HIM.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.079
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER. I'M
READY, LET'S GO MEET HIM.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.169
WHOA, HEY. YOU'RE STILL
IN YOUR PAJAMAS.

10:23.170 --> 10:24.170
YES I AM.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.080
OKAY, CASSANDRA, ACTION.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.209
WELL, THIS SUCKS.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.539
EVEN THOUGH I CAN SEE THE FUTURE,
I COULD NOT SEE MY OWN DEATH.

10:36.540 --> 10:40.919
OH, HERE'S A TIP: IF YOU'RE FIGHTING
WITH HYENAS OVER THE LAST CHICKEN LEG,

10:40.920 --> 10:42.249
LET THE HYENAS WIN.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.000
LATER.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.080
AND...

10:45.081 --> 10:46.329
DON'T SAY CUT.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.209
MAYBE SHE CAN PULL THROUGH.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.169
NO. SHE DIES.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.420
CUT!

10:52.380 --> 10:55.040
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE ARE
WRAPPED ON CASSANDRA.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.619
OH, AND IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,

10:58.620 --> 11:00.249
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO HELP YOURSELF

11:00.250 --> 11:03.170
TO THE EXTRA BLOOD AND GUTS MARINARA,
COURTESY OF KAYLA'S GRANDMA.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.789
NICE WORK.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.750
YEAH, YOU DID GREAT, HONEY.

11:10.210 --> 11:11.750
(bubbly voice) THAT
WAS SO MUCH FUN!

11:13.120 --> 11:14.250
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S OVER.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.709
WELCOME BACK, MCKENNA.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.459
ARE WE STILL GOING OUT TONIGHT?

11:18.460 --> 11:20.329
YEAH, OF COURSE.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.789
WHY WOULDN'T WE?

11:21.790 --> 11:22.790
(giggles)

11:24.000 --> 11:25.329
(gasps) OH MY GOD!

11:25.330 --> 11:28.000
MY GLITTER LIP GLOSS,
HOW I'VE MISSED YOU.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.500
(chuckles) HAVE
FUN ON YOUR DATE.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.169
WELL, MEL, WHAT I'VE
LEARNED IN POLITICS

11:36.170 --> 11:38.749
IS THAT PEOPLE AREN'T JUST
VOTING FOR THE CANDIDATE,

11:38.750 --> 11:40.119
THEY'RE VOTING FOR THE FAMILY.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.329
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE TO
MEET MY FAMILY. RIGHT, JOE?

11:43.330 --> 11:46.919
(snores)

11:46.920 --> 11:49.209
DID HE JUST FALL ASLEEP
WHILE I WAS TALKING?

11:49.210 --> 11:51.750
NO, HIS EYES ARE OPEN.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.170
(snores)

11:55.420 --> 11:57.000
THE MAN IS SNORING.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.709
YEAH. UH-HUH.

11:59.710 --> 12:02.080
HEY, JOE. YOU DIDN'T
FALL ASLEEP, RIGHT?

12:03.210 --> 12:04.290
NO.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.959
WHAT? NO, I WAS CONCENTRATING.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.209
I WAS LISTENING, UM,
TO EVERY SINGLE WORD.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.249
THAT, UH... THAT, UM...

12:13.250 --> 12:14.289
HANK.

12:14.290 --> 12:15.420
HANK WAS SAYING.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.459
WILL YOU EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND?

12:18.460 --> 12:19.539
- LISTEN...
- YEAH?

12:19.540 --> 12:21.419
YOU EITHER GO UPSTAIRS
TO BED, OR YOU PERK UP.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.289
PERK UP. PERK UP. THAT'S...

12:23.290 --> 12:24.290
ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.289
GOTTA PERK UP, GOTTA PERK UP.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.879
GOTTA... OW!

12:28.880 --> 12:30.919
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
COFFEE'S GONNA DO THE TRICK.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.709
WHAT ELSE DO WE GOT? LET ME SEE.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.079
OKAY, ENERGY DRINKS.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.670
LET'S SEE, THE CAFFEINE IN ONE CAN IS
EQUIVALENT TO NINE CUPS OF COFFEE.

12:40.540 --> 12:41.540
OH, YEAH.

12:44.620 --> 12:45.669
BABY.

12:45.670 --> 12:47.040
ALL RIGHT.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.709
I'M TELLING YOU, HANK,

12:51.710 --> 12:53.539
YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH MEL
BURKE AS YOUR CONGRESSMAN...

12:53.540 --> 12:56.289
CONGRESSWOMAN... CONGRESSPERSON...
REPRESENTATIVE.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.709
OKAY, BECAUSE MEL BURKE,

12:57.710 --> 13:00.039
MEL BURKE, MAN, SHE IS REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE

13:00.040 --> 13:01.959
YOU WANT REPRESENTING
YOUR CONSTITUENCY.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.079
JOE, IF I MAY...

13:03.080 --> 13:04.539
NO, I'M NOT DONE HERE, HONEY.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.289
(stuttering) SEE, SEE, SEE,
MEL, MEL, MEL BURKE, HANK,

13:07.290 --> 13:09.539
HAS THE CONSTITUTION TO
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION

13:09.540 --> 13:12.289
ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTITUENCY,
CONSISTENTLY. ALL RIGHT?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.039
INSISTENTLY, PERSISTENTLY.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.460
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:17.120 --> 13:19.040
JOE, THERE'S A
FIRE IN YOUR EYES.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.580
LIKE SOME SORT OF LUNATIC
ASYLUM IS BURNING DOWN.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.539
(laughs) STOP TALKING.

13:25.540 --> 13:27.169
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY? I
GOT ONE MORE THOUGHT.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.080
- ONE MORE THOUGHT.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

13:28.081 --> 13:30.039
NO, YOU DON'T. GO
GET THE CANNOLI.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.459
YES!

13:31.460 --> 13:34.249
YES! THE CANNOLI. OH!

13:34.250 --> 13:35.289
I MADE CANNOLIS.

13:35.290 --> 13:37.289
YESTERDAY, I MADE
RAVIOLI, BUT TONIGHT...

13:37.290 --> 13:38.500
CANNOLI.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.119
UH, LOOK, JOE'S JUST OVERTIRED.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.119
I KNOW HIS BEHAVIOR MAY
SEEM A LITTLE ODD.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.830
I HADN'T NOTICED.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.789
OH, YEAH.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.289
COME ON, BABY. OH,
LET ME SMELL THESE.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.579
(sniffs) BEAUTIFUL!

13:54.580 --> 13:55.580
(sneezes)

13:58.920 --> 14:00.379
OH, WELL.

14:00.380 --> 14:01.380
(grunts)

14:02.960 --> 14:05.459
SORRY, GUYS. THERE WAS A LITTLE
INCIDENT WITH THE DESSERT.

14:05.460 --> 14:08.209
(sniffing) THERE'S A
VERY SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.379
ALL RIGHT.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.289
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

14:11.290 --> 14:14.119
LOOK, MEL, THERE'S A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON A CAMPAIGN,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.919
AND IT'S NO PLACE
FOR A COKE ADDICT.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.539
A W... A WHAT?

14:17.540 --> 14:20.500
NO! (sniffs) WHERE ON EARTH
WOULD YOU GET THAT IDEA?

14:25.250 --> 14:26.959
WELL, THANK YOU FOR TONIGHT.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.709
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING.

14:28.710 --> 14:30.620
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I TOLD
YOU, JOE IS JUST SLEEP DEPRIVED.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.879
CAN I PLEASE HAVE MY COAT?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.619
YEAH, AS SOON AS YOU
LET ME EXPLAIN.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.579
I'LL EXPLAIN, I'LL EXPLAIN. ALL
RIGHT, LOOK, THE TRUTH IS, FRANK,

14:36.580 --> 14:38.539
I MIXED SOME SUBSTANCES THAT
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

14:38.540 --> 14:39.540
- HANK.
- HANK!

14:41.120 --> 14:43.379
WELL, ADMITTING YOU HAVE A
PROBLEM IS A GOOD FIRST STEP.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.829
(stammers) WHAT? NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.379
CAFFEINE SUBSTANCES.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.039
HANK, CAFFEINE.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.999
YEAH. I'VE HAD COFFEE BEFORE,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.290
AND IT NEVER LOOKED LIKE THIS.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.919
NOW, CAN I PLEASE HAVE MY COAT?

14:54.920 --> 14:57.619
UNTIL WE CLEAR THIS UP, THIS
COAT IS MY HOSTAGE. (chuckles)

14:57.620 --> 14:59.249
LOOK, MEL,

14:59.250 --> 15:01.709
I STILL THINK THAT YOU'RE
A GREAT CANDIDATE,

15:01.710 --> 15:04.379
JUST CALL ME WHEN HE
GETS CLEAN AND SOBER.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.419
- BUT...
- NOW.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.459
WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE ME MY COAT?

15:07.460 --> 15:09.120
MY KEYS ARE IN THERE.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.249
HE'S NOT A DRUG ADDICT!

15:14.250 --> 15:16.670
HE'S A MORNING LIFESTYLE
CORRESPONDENT!

15:20.000 --> 15:22.459
JOE, WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN?

15:22.460 --> 15:25.619
WHAT CAN I DO? YOU KNOW, YOU
TOLD ME TO PERK UP. I PERKED UP.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.539
ALL I HAD, HONEY, WAS THE EQUIVALENT
TO 18 TO 20 CUPS OF COFFEE.

15:28.540 --> 15:29.750
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.249
(both giggling)

15:34.250 --> 15:35.539
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:35.540 --> 15:37.419
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE
I'VE GONE OUT WITH SOMEONE

15:37.420 --> 15:39.619
WHO DIDN'T MAKE SARCASTIC
COMMENTS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.999
INCLUDING ME.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.669
(giggles) ZANDER,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

15:43.670 --> 15:47.080
YOU KNOW, I THINK I COULD
REALLY GET USED TO THIS.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.919
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"GET USED TO THIS"?

15:49.920 --> 15:51.249
WE'VE BEEN GOING
OUT FOR A MONTH.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.079
BUT WE WEREN'T REALLY GOING OUT.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.879
YOU WERE PLAYING CASSANDRA
THE WHOLE TIME,

15:54.880 --> 15:56.579
WHO'S BASED ON LENNOX,
WHO WAS MY GIRLFRIEND.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.079
SO, NATURALLY, THAT
APPEALED TO ME.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.250
HOLD ON. THAT WAS WHY YOU
WERE ATTRACTED TO ME?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.119
WELL, YEAH.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.379
BUT NOW I'M GETTING TO KNOW THE REAL
YOU, AND I REALLY LIKE THAT PERSON.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.750
SO THIS WHOLE TIME, I WAS
JUST A LENNOX SUBSTITUTE?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.500
YOU SAY THAT LIKE
IT'S A BAD THING.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.040
NOW, CAN WE JUST GO TO BED? WE CAN
GET OUR MINDS OFF THIS, CASSANDRA.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.169
I MEAN, LENNOX.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.080
I MEAN, UM, UM... MCKENNA.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.420
OH, BOY.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.789
(sighs)

16:25.790 --> 16:27.289
WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M SORRY
I MESSED THINGS UP, MEL.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.379
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
BE THERE FOR YOU.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.169
THAT WASN'T YOU. THAT
WAS SOME KIND OF

16:30.170 --> 16:31.920
SWEATY, CANNOLI-SNORTING,
COFFEE MONSTER.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.829
LOOK, MAYBE WE JUST CAN'T
BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER

16:34.830 --> 16:36.119
WHILE OUR SCHEDULES
ARE LIKE THIS.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.330
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE JUST
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.119
HEY, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT ASKING
ME TO QUIT MY JOB, HONEY,

16:41.120 --> 16:42.379
BECAUSE A LOT OF
VIEWERS RELY ON ME.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.289
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU
SHOULD GET TO BED.

16:45.290 --> 16:47.119
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.959
I GUESS, YOU KNOW,
I PROBABLY SHOULD.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.539
ALTHOUGH, WITH A
BLOOD CAFFEINE LEVEL

16:50.540 --> 16:52.879
OF 9.0, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
BE SLEEPING TILL NEXT WEEK.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.210
(giggles) 'CAUSE I'M...
WHOO, JITTERY.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.539
WELL, MISS LENNOX,
YOU WERE WRONG.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.999
I WENT OUT WITH MCKENNA,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.459
AND SHE WAS HERSELF, AND I LIKED
HER FOR HERSELF, AND SHE LIKED ME,

17:03.460 --> 17:06.040
AND I HAD A GREAT TIME.
SO THERE.

17:07.170 --> 17:08.459
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.000
I DIDN'T SAY SHE
HAD A GREAT TIME.

17:11.670 --> 17:12.709
MCKENNA DUMPED ME.

17:12.710 --> 17:14.379
WHAT? WHY?

17:14.380 --> 17:16.079
BECAUSE I REALIZED
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.329
I WAS DATING A CHARACTER AND THE
ONLY REASON I WAS DRAWN TO HER

17:19.330 --> 17:20.919
WAS 'CAUSE SHE WAS
A VERSION OF YOU.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.119
AND WHEN I TOLD HER THAT...

17:22.120 --> 17:23.459
YOU TOLD HER THAT?

17:23.460 --> 17:26.379
HOW CAN MEN BE SO STUPID IN
AN AGE WHERE YOU CAN JUST

17:26.380 --> 17:28.420
GO ONLINE AND SEARCH
WHAT NOT TO DO?

17:29.670 --> 17:31.119
I WAS TRYING TO BE
HONEST WITH HER.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.039
WELL, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET

17:33.040 --> 17:35.169
FOR GOING OUT WITH A
LESSER VERSION OF ME.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.999
(scoffs, chuckles)

17:37.000 --> 17:38.789
I WAS GOING OUT WITH THE
NICER VERSION OF YOU.

17:38.790 --> 17:39.829
UGH!

17:39.830 --> 17:41.789
OH, LIKE IT'S SOME SECRET
THAT YOU'RE DIFFICULT?

17:41.790 --> 17:43.459
I AM NOT DIFFICULT.

17:43.460 --> 17:45.670
OKAY, I AM DEEP.

17:46.670 --> 17:49.499
AND APPARENTLY, ALL YOU CAN
HANDLE IS SOMEONE SHALLOW.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.289
THIS, COMING FROM THE GIRL
WHO DATED MARCO, THE WELDER.

17:52.290 --> 17:54.000
I'VE EATEN YOGURT
SMARTER THAN THAT GUY.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.169
YEAH, WELL, HE WAS HOT.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.209
YEAH, WELL, MCKENNA WAS HOT.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.459
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M HOT.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.330
- OF COURSE YOU'RE HOT.
- WELL, SO ARE YOU.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.039
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE THE ORIGINAL.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.749
JUST BECAUSE WE HAD SEX,

18:06.750 --> 18:08.499
DOES NOT MEAN WE
ARE BACK TOGETHER.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.040
GOTCHA. LOUD AND CLEAR.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.379
BUT THAT BEING SAID, MAYBE
WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN.

18:15.380 --> 18:17.119
JUST TO GET IT OUT
OF OUR SYSTEMS.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.169
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.790
GREAT MINDS.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.669
GREAT NEWS, JOE.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.999
WE ARE UP 40% OVER LAST MONTH.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.119
NO WAY, THAT'S FANTASTIC!

18:36.120 --> 18:37.879
AND WE OWE A LOT OF THAT TO YOU.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.079
800 NEW VIEWERS IS BIG.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.709
(chuckles) OKAY. WOW.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.080
WELL, NOW, TWO...

18:48.120 --> 18:49.289
MILLION?

18:49.290 --> 18:50.829
THOUSAND.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.039
WE ARE FINALLY CLOSE TO
BEATING OUR COMPETITION.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.879
WE HAVE COMPETITION AT 5 A.M.?

18:55.880 --> 18:57.709
OH, YEAH. KNIVES, KNIVES, KNIVES

18:57.710 --> 18:59.830
HAS BEEN KICKING OUR
BUTTS FOR YEARS.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.459
PEOPLE LOVE KNIVES.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.540
(chuckles)

19:11.210 --> 19:12.670
- HEY.
- HEY.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.499
WHY ARE YOU SETTING
THE TABLE FOR TWO?

19:15.500 --> 19:17.169
DIDN'T YOU HAVE
DINNER AT LUNCHTIME?

19:17.170 --> 19:19.249
NO, I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
DOING A LOT OF THINKING

19:19.250 --> 19:20.619
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.079
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALIZED, HONEY,

19:22.080 --> 19:24.579
THAT NO JOB IS WORTH MISSING
OUT ON TIME WITH YOU.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.039
SO, TODAY,

19:26.040 --> 19:28.119
I TOLD THE SHOW THAT I QUIT.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.999
OH, JOE.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.289
I'M SO TOUCHED, BUT I DON'T WANT
YOU TO QUIT YOUR JOB FOR ME.

19:33.290 --> 19:34.999
YOU SHOULD GO RIGHT BACK
THERE AND GET THAT JOB BACK.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.329
HEY, LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.829
MY FAMILY IS MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME THAN SOME TV SHOW.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.669
BUT JOE, THIS IS YOUR BIG BREAK.

19:40.670 --> 19:42.039
THIS IS EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WANTED.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.539
I'M GONNA CALL THEM RIGHT
NOW AND TELL THEM THAT

19:43.540 --> 19:45.289
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND
YOU WANT YOUR JOB BACK.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.880
ONLY 2,000 PEOPLE
WATCH THE SHOW!

19:50.040 --> 19:52.619
MORE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING SOME GUY
CUT THROUGH A TIRE WITH A KNIFE.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.170
OH, KNIVES, KNIVES, KNIVES?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.169
IT'S ON AT 5 A.M. HOW
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

19:57.170 --> 19:59.000
I RECORD IT.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.169
YOU... LOOK, THE
POINT IS, HONEY,

20:02.170 --> 20:04.209
I AM NOT GONNA SACRIFICE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

20:04.210 --> 20:06.079
FOR ONLY 2,000 VIEWERS.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.119
OH.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.379
SO YOU FOUND OUT
NOT AS MANY PEOPLE

20:09.380 --> 20:10.709
WATCH THE SHOW AS YOU
THOUGHT THEY DID

20:10.710 --> 20:11.749
AND THAT'S WHY YOU QUIT?

20:11.750 --> 20:12.789
NO, HONEY.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.459
NO, WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT

20:14.460 --> 20:17.999
WAS THAT 2,000 PEOPLE
WAS A VERY LOW NUMBER.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.419
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

20:19.420 --> 20:23.329
SELF... 2,000 IS SO LOW.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.619
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE
LOW NUMBER OF TIMES

20:25.620 --> 20:27.999
- THAT ROMANTICALLY... -OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT, YOU ARE GONNA HURT YOURSELF

20:28.000 --> 20:29.669
TRYING TO PUT THOSE TWO
THOUGHTS TOGETHER.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.119
HONEY, LISTEN TO ME...

20:31.120 --> 20:32.710
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING
ELSE STUPID, JUST KISS ME.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.959
YOU KNOW, HONEY, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU QUITTING YOUR JOB...

20:39.960 --> 20:41.499
FOR US, BUT TELL ME,

20:41.500 --> 20:42.959
IF THERE HAD BEEN
10,000 VIEWERS,

20:42.960 --> 20:43.999
WOULD YOU STILL HAVE QUIT?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.039
YES, OF COURSE.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.040
WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN 10 MILLION?

20:48.170 --> 20:49.419
YES, OF COURSE I'D QUIT.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.499
YOU TOOK TOO LONG TO ANSWER.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.249
LOOK, LOOK, THE POINT IS

20:53.250 --> 20:55.209
I KNOW MY JOB MADE A SACRIFICE

20:55.210 --> 20:56.789
AND WE HAD TO MISS OUT ON
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.999
SO, TELL ME, HOW CAN
I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.169
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I'VE MISSED THE MOST

21:01.170 --> 21:02.579
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
SLEEPING IN YOUR OLD ROOM

21:02.580 --> 21:04.169
AND WAKING UP EARLY.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.079
OH, I BET I CAN
GUESS WHAT IT WAS.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.329
MMM, YOUR SPOONING.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.749
AW, BABY.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.249
(giggles) YOUR SPOONING
COFFEE INTO THE COFFEE MAKER.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.829
YEAH, I HAVEN'T HAD A DECENT CUP
SINCE YOU TOOK THAT DAMN JOB.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.329
BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING ELSE STUPID,

21:15.330 --> 21:16.919
- SHUT UP AND KISS ME.
- NO.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.420
COFFEE.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
OKAY.
