WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:05.771
Man:
I don't miss city life one bit.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.240
I mean, yeah, the new job
starts a little too early,

00:08.242 --> 00:10.242
But, uh, the trade-off?

00:10.244 --> 00:13.212
There's no cabs,
no subways, no stress,

00:13.214 --> 00:15.547
Quiet streets
and actual wildlife.

00:15.549 --> 00:16.782
Man (over phone):
Nice!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.018
Hang on, I'm gonna
text you a picture.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.187
(banging, thudding)

00:22.189 --> 00:23.088
Oh! Oh, no!

00:23.090 --> 00:24.089
(tires screeching)

01:03.229 --> 01:04.263
Good morning, bishop!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.732
Oh! Morning, mcgee, tony.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.401
What's up, bish?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.136
What do you got there?

01:11.138 --> 01:12.638
Oh!

01:12.640 --> 01:14.440
Just your basic bacon and egg.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.308
You want some?
No.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.143
Uh, tony and I are cleansing,
remember?

01:18.145 --> 01:19.411
Bishop:
Oh. Right.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.813
What does that entail again?

01:20.815 --> 01:22.815
One solid week
of nothing but water

01:22.817 --> 01:25.117
With lemon, cayenne pepper,
and a little bit of

01:25.119 --> 01:26.585
Maple syrup.
Mmm.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.153
And one very nice salad
every day.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.756
So this is some sort of...
Competition?

01:30.758 --> 01:31.824
No.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.525
Uh, it's quite
the opposite.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.760
After mcgee's

01:34.762 --> 01:36.128
Recent emancipation

01:36.130 --> 01:37.563
From coupledom,

01:37.565 --> 01:38.730
He was talking about

01:38.732 --> 01:39.865
Making a fresh start.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.133
A clean break.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.134
Purging some toxins.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.769
And so I thought

01:43.771 --> 01:46.171
I would offer to help him out.
Mcgee:
Stop.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.207
First off, no one is
"emancipated."

01:48.209 --> 01:49.608
Delilah just happened
to land a dream job

01:49.610 --> 01:50.843
Halfway around the world.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.311
And secondly,

01:52.313 --> 01:54.179
I seem to remember tony

01:54.181 --> 01:55.447
Wanting to kick-start
the new year

01:55.449 --> 01:56.849
With a healthier new him.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.718
But new year's was months ago.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.287
Today is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.790
Actually, it's day two
and I feel fantastic.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.892
It's much easier with a buddy,
isn't it?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.594
Yeah, you bet, buddy!

02:08.596 --> 02:11.263
Then... You're okay if
I eat this in front of you?

02:11.265 --> 02:12.264
Absolutely.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.265
(scoffs)

02:13.267 --> 02:14.266
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

02:14.268 --> 02:15.534
You sure?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.402
I mean, I... I can go elsewhere.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.871
Well, we're all going elsewhere.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.707
Dead navy officer in chesapeake.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.143
In that case, nobody'll mind
if I finish this in the car.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.646
This is gonna be a long ride.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.219
Mcgee: Well, victim is
ensign lester tate, 23,

02:34.221 --> 02:36.321
Currently assigned
to the uss <i>soteria,</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:38.323
Home-ported a few miles
from here in norfolk.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.858
What do you think, duck?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.627
Mm, it was not
that texting driver

02:41.629 --> 02:43.362
That killed the ensign.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.497
But that damn fool
should be stripped of both

02:45.499 --> 02:47.232
His phone and his car.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.834
He already dead?

02:48.836 --> 02:49.868
Quite.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.905
These facial abrasions and...

02:52.907 --> 02:54.773
Bruised knuckles would indicate

02:54.775 --> 02:57.943
A spirited round
of fisticuffs.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.812
As usual, jethro, we'll
know more in autopsy.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.714
Hey, how's that
cleanse going, guys?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.750
Shh.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.751
The what?!

03:05.753 --> 03:06.852
Nothing, boss.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.387
Ah, yes, mr. Palmer's

03:08.389 --> 03:11.423
Been telling me
about your joint endeavor.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.258
It's the
age-old pursuit,

03:13.260 --> 03:15.794
Jethro, of purifying
one's system with

03:15.796 --> 03:20.465
A supplemented diet,
or colonic irrigation, perhaps?

03:20.467 --> 03:22.467
Hmm. You guys
doing that together, too?

03:23.603 --> 03:24.770
Keep shooting, probie.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.472
Do we have surveillance?

03:27.474 --> 03:29.241
Uh, none on this road, gibbs.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.243
You and tony check the other
roads, canvass the neighbors,

03:31.245 --> 03:33.712
See who saw the fight.
Mcgee, come on, you're with me.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.921
Welcome aboard.
How can I help you?

03:42.923 --> 03:46.391
Ensign, a word
with your xo.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.894
Oh. Good timing, sir.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.663
Commander wexler?
Ncis on board.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.799
What can I do for ncis today?

03:53.801 --> 03:56.902
You have an officer in your
command, an ensign lester tate.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.971
Oh, he's on leave
till 0600 tomorrow, sir.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.306
Something wrong?

04:01.308 --> 04:03.542
We're afraid he
won't be reporting.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.910
He was just found dead.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.478
What?!

04:06.480 --> 04:09.281
Oh, my god.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.950
Looked like he'd
been in a fight.
Mcgee: Is there anything

04:11.952 --> 04:13.919
You can tell us--
any conflicts or enemies?

04:13.921 --> 04:14.987
None.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.990
Far as I know,
everybody loved the guy.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.992
What about burke? Is he okay?

04:19.994 --> 04:22.027
Who's burke?
Ensign thomas burke.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.329
He and tate are good friends.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.698
They rented a crash pad
in town for the week.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.767
Only, burke...

04:28.769 --> 04:30.936
Didn't report
for quarters this morning.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.006
I just marked him
"unauthorized absence."

04:34.008 --> 04:37.009
You have an address?

04:37.011 --> 04:39.311
Well, this is just
a few blocks

04:39.313 --> 04:41.313
From where we
found tate's body.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.315
(sighs) no luck with
neighbors, gibbs,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.384
Nobody saw a thing.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.389
Ensign burke!

04:50.391 --> 04:53.358
Ncis! Open up!

04:53.360 --> 04:55.694
(thudding, clattering)

04:55.696 --> 04:57.763
Okay.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.369
Get your hands
on top of your head!

05:04.371 --> 05:05.604
Mcgee: Ncis!
Bishop: Don't move!

05:05.606 --> 05:07.439
I didn't do it!

05:07.441 --> 05:09.508
Well, that's good to know.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.588
Poor tate.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.590
Never should have left him.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.426
You left him where?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.394
The silver leaf. This, um...

05:29.396 --> 05:31.063
This bar not far from here.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.965
I cut out when he started
ordering shots.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.534
Around midnight or so.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.737
I just can't
believe he's dead.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.572
All right, why don't
we forget last night.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.940
Let's talk about
two minutes ago.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.609
What about two minutes ago?
Remember
that time

05:44.611 --> 05:46.578
When we crashed through the
doors and we had our guns

05:46.580 --> 05:47.813
And you went,
"I didn't do it!"

05:47.815 --> 05:51.516
You didn't do
what, exactly?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.519
You didn't know
tate was dead, burke.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.554
What didn't you do?
I...

05:55.556 --> 05:58.790
I, um... I-I'm drawing a blank.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.559
I mean, you just
startled me, that's all.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.993
I don't know what I was saying.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.528
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.696
Well, I can't.
I mean,

06:04.698 --> 06:06.431
That's as good as I got. I...

06:06.433 --> 06:07.833
You know, if you're
gonna keep asking me,

06:07.835 --> 06:10.535
Maybe I should have
a lawyer present.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.670
Bedrooms are clear.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.405
Pretty gross, but clear.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.973
Dinozzo, take
bishop with you

06:14.975 --> 06:16.708
And check out the bar.
Burke...

06:16.710 --> 06:18.643
You want a lawyer, call one.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.480
Tell them to meet you at ncis.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.015
Say cheese.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.885
Man: Yeah, he was here
last night,

06:26.887 --> 06:28.720
Till about midnight or so.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.523
His buddy stuck around
a while after.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.525
Would this be his buddy?

06:33.527 --> 06:34.826
That's him.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.128
Didn't realize
he was navy.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.729
Nice kid.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.997
Hated having to
throw him out.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.565
Throw him out?

06:40.567 --> 06:41.700
Him and some
other guy.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.468
Hell, he might have
been navy, too.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.636
Why'd you throw 'em out?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.605
Trading punches
over some girl.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.807
Just before closing,
around 2:00.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.576
Some girl in here?
Couldn't tell you.
All I heard was

06:51.578 --> 06:54.613
A lot of "she"s and "her"s
as they were throwing haymakers.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.581
(laughs) it was
like a hockey fight.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.583
Did it, uh, did it
continue outside?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.752
Couldn't tell you.
My jurisdiction ends here.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.688
You said the other guy
you tossed out was navy, too?
I said maybe.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.191
I get navy people,
dock workers, townies.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.493
They all kind of
blend in around here.

07:08.495 --> 07:11.430
Mm. So no name or description?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.532
I'm better with drinks
than names.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.766
Kind of short,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.134
Dark hair, 20s.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.602
Any other customers
who saw the fight?

07:17.604 --> 07:18.637
Again, I'm better

07:18.639 --> 07:20.739
With drinks...
Than names, yeah.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.207
All right, you give me a call

07:22.209 --> 07:24.109
If you can think
of anything else. Thanks.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.944
You bet.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.916
What do you got, duck?

07:30.918 --> 07:35.620
Uh, ensign tate's
blood alcohol level, 0.11.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.622
Not fall-down drunk,
but drunk enough.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.890
Cause of death?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.725
Ah, well, I've managed
to narrow it down

07:40.727 --> 07:43.528
To blunt-force crush trauma

07:43.530 --> 07:44.863
To the squamosal suture.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.665
Yeah, it's a
vulnerable

07:46.667 --> 07:48.834
Sweet spot where
these plates meet.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.703
Not so sweet
for ensign tate.
Indeed.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.172
It's likely that
the ensign's killer

07:54.174 --> 07:55.807
Smashed his head
against the pavement.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.542
Possibly repeatedly.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.878
Yeah, I managed to pull some
asphalt samples.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.680
I was about to
bring them up to abby,

08:01.682 --> 08:02.747
See what they tell her.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.082
Well, have her tell me.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
Mmm!

08:08.722 --> 08:11.256
You give your
taste buds a breather,

08:11.258 --> 08:13.792
Suddenly vegetables come
a whole lot more tasty.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.994
Hilarious.
We have a timeline yet?

08:15.996 --> 08:20.565
We know ensigns lester tate
and thomas burke

08:20.567 --> 08:22.834
Met at the silver leaf
at about 2145.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.071
Burke left at midnight.
Tate and a mystery man were

08:26.073 --> 08:28.607
Tossed out for
fighting around 2:00.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.942
Not much of a description, but
we put a bolo out just the same.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.677
Anything on
tate's cell phone?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.679
Yeah, one short call
last night between him

08:34.681 --> 08:36.948
And ensign burke at 2115.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.284
The old "meet me
for a beer" call.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.920
Yup. Before that,
a few calls to his ship,

08:41.922 --> 08:43.955
A few more
to burke, and...

08:43.957 --> 08:45.624
That's weird.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.225
What's weird?

08:47.227 --> 08:50.795
Two days ago, tate exchanged
multiple calls from this number.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.997
Which number?

08:52.798 --> 08:54.165
It's our number.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.201
The ncis information line.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.169
Hang on...

08:58.171 --> 08:59.638
Okay, it's not us.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.972
Calls went through
our main line,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.741
But came out of our
f-and-s-v unit.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.176
Family and sexual violence?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.845
What'd they want with tate?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.113
Vance:
Well, we're about to find out.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.748
Gibbs.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.823
Special agent
maureen cabot,

09:18.825 --> 09:20.759
I'm sure you
and agent gibbs have

09:20.761 --> 09:22.260
Crossed paths
at some point.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.863
At various agency functions
we're forced to attend, yes.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.064
You still driving
that chevy?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.600
(laughing): Yes.
(laughs)

09:28.602 --> 09:30.936
As you know, the navy
is pushing harder than ever

09:30.938 --> 09:32.871
To eradicate sexual assault
in their ranks.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.340
Was ensign tate a rape suspect?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.609
Right to the point, as always.

09:37.611 --> 09:41.913
Uh, no, gibbs, um, tate was
a second-party complainant.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.015
He reported an assault
on behalf of a friend.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.283
What friend?

09:45.285 --> 09:46.785
A fellow
junior officer

09:46.787 --> 09:48.620
Now refusing
to cooperate, director.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.854
Denies it ever happened.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.923
What made tate think it did?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.192
Tate came to us two days ago,
saying his friend's behavior

09:54.194 --> 09:55.961
Had changed
in the last few weeks.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.929
Uh, distracted,
short-tempered.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.298
When he asked her about it,
she admitted the assault

10:00.300 --> 10:01.800
And swore him to secrecy.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.802
But he came to you anyway.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.837
If only more like him did.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.372
Did he know
the attacker?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.207
No, and neither did the victim.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.842
She claimed that she'd been
drugged and unconscious

10:10.844 --> 10:12.110
During the attack.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.646
So no suspects.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.947
Oh, we've got suspects.
She told tate

10:15.949 --> 10:17.649
That the assaults occurred

10:17.651 --> 10:18.883
After a night drinking with him

10:18.885 --> 10:19.985
And several other
junior officers

10:19.987 --> 10:21.286
During a port visit.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.887
Vance:
Did tate's roommate burke

10:22.889 --> 10:23.855
Know about the attack?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.223
Cabot:
No, and his denials

10:25.225 --> 10:26.791
Were quite vehement.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.860
"I didn't do it"
and "it wasn't me,"

10:28.862 --> 10:29.995
Over and over.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.396
So, why is the victim
denying it now?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.897
Take your pick, sir.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.134
Shame, fear, loss
of peer status.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.904
Did she know that it was tate
who told you?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.306
He's the only one
she confided in,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.041
So she had a pretty good idea.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.978
Who is she?

10:48.948 --> 10:50.815
Special agent gibbs.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.250
You need our xo again?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.885
No.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.388
I'm here to see you,
ensign farrell.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.324
Me?

11:00.292 --> 11:02.761
I'm sorry, holly.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.176
I told you,
there was no assault.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.744
It never happened.

11:19.746 --> 11:23.715
Ensign tate said
you confided in him.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.183
Why would he make that up?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.786
You'd need to
ask ensign tate.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.055
It's a little late for that.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.723
He was my friend.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.825
I would never kill
him or anyone else.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.361
We were wondering if anyone else

11:36.363 --> 11:38.263
Could have acted on your behalf.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.766
What, like a hit man?

11:41.768 --> 11:45.336
There anyone else who knows?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.305
Anyone else you confided in?

11:47.307 --> 11:51.276
Never. I mean, I would never
tell anyone else that...

11:54.280 --> 11:56.781
There was nothing to tell.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.050
Nothing happened.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.955
(voice breaking:
God, I don't want
to be doing this.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.992
The only person
you told is dead.

12:07.994 --> 12:11.029
But that had nothing
to do with me, right?

12:11.031 --> 12:14.032
Please tell me it had nothing
to do with what I told him.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.402
Well, to do that, I would have
to know what you said to him.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.244
We had a port call in
key west last month.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.813
The crew hit liberty
like it was spring break.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.983
I stuck with my
brothers, as usual,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.818
My fellow j.O.'s.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.286
How many?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.021
Uh, six, including
burke and tate.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.424
I can usually handle
my margaritas,

12:39.426 --> 12:42.260
But halfway
through my second,

12:42.262 --> 12:46.331
I... I felt like I had
chugged a whole bottle.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.168
So I headed back
to the ship early.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.404
As the only female j.O.,
you had your own quarters?

12:55.174 --> 12:58.843
Next morning, I can't
say I, uh... I woke up.

12:58.845 --> 13:02.347
It was more like
I... I came to.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.116
I felt beaten up,

13:05.118 --> 13:08.186
Like I'd been through
a cement mixer.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.890
At first, I was...
I was so mortified.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.558
I felt like I'd done
something terrible.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.394
So then I just...

13:16.396 --> 13:20.498
Hit the showers and pretended
like it never happened.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.270
Next few weeks,
I felt worthless...

13:25.272 --> 13:27.272
Paranoid...

13:27.274 --> 13:28.807
I mean, even
with my friends.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.409
I-I had no idea
who attacked me,

13:31.411 --> 13:34.979
So I couldn't help but
wonder if maybe they did.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.048
I swear it was...

13:37.050 --> 13:40.218
It was like I was
losing my mind.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.487
Until tate asked
what was wrong?

13:44.523 --> 13:47.325
Then the floodgates opened.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.360
Tate was so sweet.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.229
He wanted me to call

13:51.231 --> 13:54.833
The dod help safeline,
but I... I-I couldn't.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.135
I made him promise
he wouldn't either.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.270
And that's when he came to us.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.438
Hey, gibbs.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.174
Tony said that
you wanted to...

14:03.176 --> 14:04.876
To see me.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.612
I'll be right back.

14:12.551 --> 14:16.321
Abbs, how long do drugs
stay in a person's system?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.223
Um, well, it depends
on the drug.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.357
A roofie of some kind.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.059
Oh, no.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.161
Oh, god, that poor girl.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.863
Abby, how long?

14:24.865 --> 14:26.064
Not long.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.433
72 hours.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.500
What are you doing?!

14:29.502 --> 14:30.535
Holly, stop.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.370
Are you telling her about this?!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.272
I was gonna have
you drug-tested.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.306
A drug test?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.908
That would make
sense, holly.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.543
If we can prove that
you were drugged...

14:38.545 --> 14:41.212
You can prove
I'm not a liar?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.313
No one thinks you're lying.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.549
So now this woman
knows about it.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.019
And soon the entire navy
will know about it?

14:48.021 --> 14:51.189
I would never tell a soul.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.224
If we found a drug
in you, farrell,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.460
We might have traced it
to whoever attacked you.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.228
And catching him

14:57.230 --> 14:59.530
Might have pointed to
whoever killed your friend.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.967
You can do that?

15:02.969 --> 15:04.335
Well, we'd have tried.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.571
But abby here tells me
that any drug like that

15:06.573 --> 15:08.573
Would've been out of
your system by now.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.977
But we still
have you, holly.

15:12.979 --> 15:17.348
If you cooperate, we can go full
bore after whoever attacked you.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.153
No.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.289
I'm sorry.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.428
Bishop:
<i>Have you seen the numbers</i>

15:30.430 --> 15:32.163
On sexual assaults?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.431
Pretty bad.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.700
Yeah, for all the talk about
preventing it,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.435
Condemning it, avoiding it,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.071
The numbers on it
never seem to go down.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.473
Everybody knows somebody
with a story to tell.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.575
Or not tell.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.245
Gibbs:
Somebody what?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.514
Where are we on tate's murder?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.316
Roommate's
alibi cleared.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.984
Landlord saw
burke stumble home

15:52.986 --> 15:54.652
A solid hour before
tate's bar fight.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.621
We got anything new on that?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.490
Well, if there is a rape
involved, we have a new theory

15:59.492 --> 16:02.427
As to who tate and our mystery
man may have been fighting over.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.395
Tony: Bar's owner
heard them say "she" and "her"

16:04.397 --> 16:05.997
As he was tossing them.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.266
We now wonder if "she"
is ensign farrell.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.735
And if our mystery man
also happens to be our rapist,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.537
He may have gone to the bar
to shut tate up.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.340
Tony: And if he's on
the crew of tate's ship,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.342
Then we can show the photos
to the bartender,

16:17.344 --> 16:18.476
And mystery solved.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.011
Well, then why are you
still here?

16:20.013 --> 16:21.045
(cell phone ringing)

16:21.047 --> 16:22.547
Yeah, it's gibbs.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.215
(indistinct talking over phone)
yeah, director.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.450
I'm on my way.

16:30.522 --> 16:34.292
Gibbs thinks tate's killer could
point us to holly's attacker.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.996
Or one case has nothing
to do with the other.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.298
One thing I do know:
Without holly cooperating,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.233
The rape case is a
lot harder to prove.

16:42.235 --> 16:47.405
Look, I... I hate to ask,
but one bogus claim

16:47.407 --> 16:49.440
Can cast doubt on
a hundred legitimate ones.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.044
So are we sure that there is
something to prove?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.412
You both spoke to her.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.315
We're sure, director.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.551
I'm sure, leon.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.720
Damn.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.155
What?

17:04.157 --> 17:06.157
Well, just last week,

17:06.159 --> 17:08.393
My daughter tells me that...

17:09.795 --> 17:13.431
...She would like to become
a navy officer someday.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.634
Just like thousands of women
all around the country.

17:16.636 --> 17:22.073
I want there to be no cases
like this when they get there.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.344
So there's really
no convincing farrell?

17:26.346 --> 17:29.080
Not until she's ready.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.649
All she wants is to
get back to her ship.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.587
All right.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.659
Oh, don't...
Don't get up.

17:43.529 --> 17:47.532
I just wanted to come
and check on you.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.500
Sorry I yelled before.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.402
I'm usually
a more trusting person.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.705
Oh, you don't have
anything to be sorry for.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.508
And I just wanted
to tell you that

17:57.510 --> 18:01.612
I don't have any
firsthand experience with

18:01.614 --> 18:03.848
What you went through,

18:03.850 --> 18:06.818
But nothing
makes me sadder

18:06.820 --> 18:09.087
Or madder

18:09.089 --> 18:11.689
Or badder than
even the thought

18:11.691 --> 18:13.524
Of what was done to you.

18:13.526 --> 18:18.096
And I really didn't
mean to rhyme just now.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.765
You summed it up nicely.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.401
As far as trust goes,

18:23.403 --> 18:25.636
I want you to trust
me when I tell you

18:25.638 --> 18:27.305
That you can trust
agent gibbs.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.506
Like, a lot.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.375
And I don't know
agent cabot that well,

18:31.377 --> 18:35.113
But I know that her unit
is-is busting their butt

18:35.115 --> 18:36.714
To try to stop
what happened to you

18:36.716 --> 18:39.150
From ever happening
to anyone else.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.753
I mean, how is
anything good and right

18:42.755 --> 18:47.258
Supposed to make its way,
if we don't help?

18:50.462 --> 18:51.829
Oh, hey, gibbs.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.664
I wasn't trying to intrude.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.867
I just wanted to
check in on holly

18:55.869 --> 18:57.535
Before she goes.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.671
Is she still going?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.673
Can't make her stay.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.309
Come on, holly, I'll drive you
back to your ship.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.348
Don't be a stranger.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.217
Just take care
of yourself.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.922
Wait.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.328
I lied to you before.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.564
You lied to me?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.533
All of you.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.867
Including tate.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.869
Cabot:
What are you saying?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.704
What really
happened, holly?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.240
What haven't you
told us, farrell?

19:36.242 --> 19:39.577
I didn't hit the showers
first thing that morning.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.646
I went to the nas clinic

19:41.648 --> 19:44.916
And filed a restricted report
in key west.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.185
D-did they run
a rape kit?

19:47.187 --> 19:49.387
Yeah. That's when
it sunk in--

19:49.389 --> 19:50.821
The idea of
everyone knowing.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.823
I couldn't go any further.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.659
That rape kit will
still be in storage.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.827
If you file an
unrestricted report,

19:56.829 --> 19:59.330
We-we can have it
sent here.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.332
It might take
a few days...
N-no, it won't.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.868
Okay.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.736
I'll give a statement.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.809
She'll get the kit.

20:14.746 --> 20:18.683
(lively music playing)

20:18.685 --> 20:19.984
Bishop: Is there any
chance tate fought

20:19.986 --> 20:21.319
With one of
his shipmates?

20:21.321 --> 20:23.688
No, none of them look familiar.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.389
Anyone here in the bar
see the fight last night?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.725
None that I see.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.728
But give me a minute,
I'll look through those again.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.700
Waitress: Here you go.
Oh, perfect.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.336
Thank you.
(sighs)

20:38.338 --> 20:39.403
What's that?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.972
Oh, sorry.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.907
Uh, the waitress came by
while you were in the bathroom.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.243
Chili cheese fries?
Are you serious?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.579
Well, I haven't eaten
since lunch.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.248
What are you talking about?
You've been eating continuously.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.516
You've had, like,
nine or ten lunches since lunch.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.651
I am not.
It just seems that way

20:53.653 --> 20:55.486
Because you're not eating
at all.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.888
You're diabolically cruel.
No, what's cruel

20:57.890 --> 20:59.523
Is what you're doing
to yourself.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.592
I mean, I don't even know why
you need to cleanse.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.327
If mcgee can do it, so can I.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.796
Ah! So this is a competition,
which is... Crazy.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.833
I mean, you both look... Fine.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.835
"fine." see what I mean?
Yeah.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.803
Yeah-- good, fit, healthy...

21:12.805 --> 21:14.272
...Ish.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.673
Ish?
Yeah.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.308
Like you guys have anything
to worry about

21:17.310 --> 21:18.576
In the looks department.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.844
Give me a break.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.445
Well, when you put it
like that...

21:21.447 --> 21:22.847
Man (slurring):
Hey, fella.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.049
You mind if I dance
with your daughter?

21:27.786 --> 21:29.820
Get me some more water, please?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.822
(quietly):
That's him.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.690
This guy?

21:32.692 --> 21:33.791
Me?
No, not-not you.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.059
Him.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.694
Get out of here.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.995
Green shirt.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.698
Just walked in.
That's the guy from last night.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.667
He's so not navy.

21:42.669 --> 21:43.868
I said maybe.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.936
I'll cover the door.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.844
Hey, there,
can I ask you a couple...

21:53.846 --> 21:55.946
Hey!
Ncis! Don't move!

21:55.948 --> 21:56.947
(grunts)

21:56.949 --> 21:58.816
Stop! Hey!

22:00.852 --> 22:03.721
(gasps, then yells in pain)

22:03.723 --> 22:05.389
(moaning)

22:05.391 --> 22:07.391
(chuckles)

22:07.393 --> 22:11.028
Well, you can't beat
a well-placed dumpster.

22:21.873 --> 22:24.508
Quite a hit parade
here, eddie.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.346
Armed robbery, drunk
and disorderly...

22:28.348 --> 22:30.481
Doesn't mean I killed anybody.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.616
Then why'd you run?

22:32.618 --> 22:34.618
I'm an ex-con.
That's what we do.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.620
So you don't have any friends
in the navy?

22:36.622 --> 22:39.457
Never been to key west?

22:39.459 --> 22:42.093
Look, I know nothing
about any girl on a boat.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.028
Then who were you
fighting over?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.863
Some chick
at the bar.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.699
I was getting my grind on and
she pretended not to like it,

22:48.701 --> 22:50.634
Then suddenly navy boy
gets in my face,

22:50.636 --> 22:51.869
Saying it's creeps like me

22:51.871 --> 22:53.704
That make life worse for guys
like him.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.705
You believe that?

22:54.707 --> 22:55.906
Completely.
Very much so.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.908
So bing-bang-boom,
we did our dance,

22:57.910 --> 22:59.744
And the bartender tosses us both

22:59.746 --> 23:01.712
And we go our separate ways.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.748
You sure about that last part?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.950
I flew one way,
navy boy the other.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.953
Believe me, I wanted
another crack at him,
but my eye was cut.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.489
That's why I went back to the
bar last night looking for him.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.657
Why would I do that
if I knew he was dead?

23:17.796 --> 23:19.497
Charming fellow.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.698
Not our killer.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.634
No. He has nothing to do
with our assault.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.636
Any word
from agent cabot?

23:25.638 --> 23:27.872
Farrell gave her
a full statement.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.940
Now we just wait
for the rape kit.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.909
Wait no more, gibbs.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.811
I mean, not for the kit
'cause that's still in transit.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.780
But I was able
to pull some strings

23:35.782 --> 23:38.649
With the sexual assault
nurse examiner in key west.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.452
I got the preliminary results.
Mmm.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.425
Negative for dna.
Yeah.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.860
It's not uncommon for attackers
to wear a condom.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.962
But look at the drug tests.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.697
Ketamine?

23:53.699 --> 23:55.699
A horse tranquilizer?

23:55.701 --> 23:57.134
Special k.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.069
The other date rape drug.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.906
My god,
what chance did she have?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.741
She's got a better chance now.

24:03.743 --> 24:04.742
Gibbs...

24:06.178 --> 24:08.712
...Go and get
this son of a bitch.

24:12.717 --> 24:16.754
So this attack had nothing to do
with ensign tate's murder?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.055
Gibbs:
We don't know yet,
captain.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.758
Case is under
separate investigation.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.860
We're here solely
on ensign farrell's behalf.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.696
Zero tolerance is no slogan
around here, agents--

24:25.698 --> 24:27.731
It's a moral imperative.
If that officer was harmed

24:27.733 --> 24:30.234
On this ship, we'll move heaven
and earth to help you.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.770
I only wish farrell had
said something at the time.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.871
We could've done
something about it.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.739
We're doing something now.

24:35.741 --> 24:38.108
We'll start by interviewing
the four remaining j.O.'s

24:38.110 --> 24:39.910
Who were with farrell and tate
in key west.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.745
They're all yours.
Mcgee:
Captain, there was also

24:41.747 --> 24:43.948
A sedative used in the attack,

24:43.950 --> 24:45.783
And, without probable cause,
we can't search

24:45.785 --> 24:47.685
Your ship ourselves, so...

24:47.687 --> 24:49.653
Understood. Xo...

24:49.655 --> 24:51.188
Conduct a health
and welfare inspection.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.556
Aye, sir.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.660
Fine with me
if you want to tag along.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.563
Yeah, sounds good.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.866
Cabot:
<i>Just putting together</i>
<i>a timeline,</i>

25:01.868 --> 25:03.667
Ensign.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.103
Whatever you recall about
that shore leave in key west.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.939
Well, I-I know
we all had fun.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.941
Just so stoked being back
on dry land.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.977
Nothing but shipmates
in every bar.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.845
It's like
we took over the town.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.147
Seemed to me
like holly was having a blast,

25:17.149 --> 25:18.682
Like the rest of us.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.017
Did I see her leave the party?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.919
I didn't see me leave the party.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.255
Me and tate were calling her
lightweight for leaving early.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.291
We should've walked her back.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.293
Yeah, pretty sure
I saw holly at breakfast.

25:29.295 --> 25:34.031
Tate asked me, a few weeks
later, if holly seemed okay.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.066
I mean, yeah,
maybe she was a bit off,

25:36.068 --> 25:39.136
But only tate would come out
and ask her why.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.138
When agent cabot brought you in
about the assault,

25:41.140 --> 25:44.174
Did you think
that tate had accused you?

25:44.176 --> 25:45.709
No way. No, no, no.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.845
Tate was my boy.
He knew me better than that.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.914
So you were...
You were never mad at tate.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.949
No, sir.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.817
I was mad
at whoever did that to holly.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.787
That's why I called tate
to meet me at the bar.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.123
I couldn't believe
she didn't tell us.
That girl was like our sister.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.225
She always
has our backs.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.761
And if we'd known what happened,

26:03.763 --> 26:06.330
We'd have had her back, too.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.099
Once you got back to the ship
that night, what was that like?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.935
Everybody messing around,
playing jokes.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.336
No idea what time it was.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.005
Well, hang on, I-I know
what time it was. This...

26:15.007 --> 26:18.242
App on my phone, it, uh,
timestamps all my photos.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.711
Yeah, here we are,

26:20.713 --> 26:23.881
For better or worse,
back in our bunks

26:23.883 --> 26:27.051
At 0332.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.986
Cabot:
There you are.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.321
All together.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.990
Any pictures of holly
that night?

26:32.992 --> 26:34.892
Uh, sure, I must have a few.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.694
At least, I think so.

26:36.696 --> 26:39.029
She did cut out early,
so...

26:39.031 --> 26:41.065
Yeah, here's one.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.268
A nice
group shot.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.107
Keep your chinny chin up, mcgee.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.142
We'll talk to you soon.

26:52.144 --> 26:55.212
All right, search of the ship
produced a dozen cuban cigars,

26:55.214 --> 26:57.748
Some bootleg dvds and one...

26:57.750 --> 26:59.016
Stowaway ferret.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.719
(sighs)
but no ketamine.
Apparently

27:01.721 --> 27:03.621
Gibbs' interviews
didn't go much better.

27:03.623 --> 27:06.256
Then there's our case.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.325
Oh, yeah... (sighs)

27:08.327 --> 27:09.259
We're in great shape.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.095
(stomach growls)

27:11.097 --> 27:13.731
Don't say it,
miss chili cheese.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.267
Ah, just the agents
for whom I was looking.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.103
How are you, ducky?

27:19.105 --> 27:21.238
Better, thank you, eleanor;
now that I have ascertained

27:21.240 --> 27:25.142
A more definitive cause
of death for ensign tate.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.677
Your prelim said
it was blunt force

27:26.679 --> 27:28.379
To the quasimodo something.
Mmm.

27:28.381 --> 27:31.915
The squamosal suture was
in fact the culprit, tony,

27:31.917 --> 27:34.118
But death was far
from instantaneous.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.721
The ensign suffered
an epidural hematoma.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.890
Like a slow bleed?
Yeah, slow enough

27:39.892 --> 27:43.093
That he may well have been able
to walk a fair distance

27:43.095 --> 27:46.230
Before finally succumbing
to his injury.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.298
Walked?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.300
Like, from the bar?

27:50.302 --> 27:52.136
What punch could land
hard enough to cause

27:52.138 --> 27:54.905
An epidural hematoma
to the squamosal suture?

27:54.907 --> 27:56.140
Show-off.
Jimmy:
Hey, guys,

27:56.142 --> 27:58.108
Um, abby's tied up,
you know,

27:58.110 --> 27:59.343
On the...
On the other case,

27:59.345 --> 28:01.211
But she wanted me
to show this to both of you.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.013
Has to do with that asphalt
that we pulled

28:03.015 --> 28:04.248
From ensign tate's head wound.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.115
What about it?

28:05.117 --> 28:07.117
Well, aside from the...

28:07.119 --> 28:09.319
Usual bituminous sand and tar,

28:09.321 --> 28:10.754
She also found
trace elements

28:10.756 --> 28:12.322
Of vegetable oil.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.224
Vegetable oil...

28:14.226 --> 28:16.226
You know, like old,
burnt vegetable oil

28:16.228 --> 28:19.430
With microscopic bits
of potato,

28:19.432 --> 28:21.131
Bread, onion...

28:22.200 --> 28:24.268
Like from a deep fryer.
Exactly.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.104
Jimmy: But I don't remember any
fast food joints near there...

28:27.106 --> 28:29.239
No, but apparently they do.

28:30.408 --> 28:33.343
Listen, uh,
I-I kind of hate to ask,

28:33.345 --> 28:37.715
But is there any kind of reward
for helping you catch this guy?

28:37.717 --> 28:40.718
We'll get to that, fred.
But first we need to clear up
a few more details.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.153
So, you dragged
both men out here

28:43.155 --> 28:44.788
And sent them
in separate directions?

28:44.790 --> 28:46.123
Yeah, I pushed one guy that way.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.492
Which guy? Ensign tate?

28:48.494 --> 28:50.227
No, your bad guy.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.196
The navy guy I pushed that way,
toward the street.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.465
Ah, towards
the street

28:54.467 --> 28:56.867
And this
not-very-well-placed

28:56.869 --> 28:59.236
And quite greasy
dumpster.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.371
Yeah, I been meaning
to clean that.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.374
Any chance tate
could have hit the dumpster

29:04.376 --> 29:06.076
When you pushed him?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.312
I guess. It's right there. Why?

29:08.314 --> 29:12.082
Because our "bad guy,"
as you call him...

29:12.084 --> 29:14.885
He's not our killer.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.353
Okay.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.156
So no reward?

29:19.158 --> 29:23.160
Uh, a very delicate spot
on tate's skull

29:23.162 --> 29:25.362
Hit something hard,

29:25.364 --> 29:28.232
Heavy and... Well, greasy.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.368
It caused his brain
to bleed and...
Wait...

29:31.370 --> 29:35.339
Are you saying I killed him?

29:35.341 --> 29:37.941
Well, you obviously
didn't mean to.

29:37.943 --> 29:41.211
No, no--
I-it all happened so fast.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.280
All I did was push.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.349
We know that.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.852
Oh, my god,
what did... What did I do?

29:48.854 --> 29:52.222
He... He was just a kid.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.792
Oh, my god,
what did I do?

29:54.794 --> 29:57.094
(crying)

30:04.302 --> 30:05.469
So tate defends
a girl's honor

30:05.471 --> 30:07.304
And ends up getting
thrown on his head?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.439
More or less. Accidental.

30:09.441 --> 30:13.277
And it had nothing to do
with what happened with me.

30:13.279 --> 30:17.014
Nothing beyond tate trying to do
the right thing, both times.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.348
(exhales)

30:18.350 --> 30:19.449
That's him
all the way.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.451
Think that's why I told him,

30:21.453 --> 30:24.454
Hoping deep down, he'd tell you
about it so I didn't have to.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.524
I was just filling holly in
on our interviews.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.526
How could I ever doubt
those guys?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.528
Like they'd ever be capable.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.398
A long way from perfect
but they're my brothers

30:34.400 --> 30:36.867
And I turned on them.
No.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.369
No, someone turned on you.
And we will

30:39.371 --> 30:41.338
Find him, holly,
even if it means talking

30:41.340 --> 30:43.207
To every last man and woman
on that ship.

30:43.209 --> 30:46.310
I'm not saying I don't want you
to talk to the whole ship.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.611
I'm just saying
that once you do,

30:47.613 --> 30:50.047
I'm not sure I can go back
on that ship.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.448
Or any ship.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.916
Don't quit.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.385
I don't want to quit, sir.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.188
But I also don't want people
looking at me differently

30:58.190 --> 31:00.023
And whispering behind my back.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.960
That's something I don't think
I can live with.

31:04.629 --> 31:06.063
Abby:
Gibbs, gibbs,
gibbs, gibbs, gibbs.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.464
We got something.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.900
Tell 'em, mcgee.
Well, it was
a long shot, boss,

31:09.902 --> 31:12.202
But I got so frustrated
when the ship search

31:12.204 --> 31:13.937
Came up empty,
I ran a cross-check

31:13.939 --> 31:16.073
Between navy personnel
and ketamine use.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.274
And he got a hit.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.009
A civilian medical clinic
in san diego

31:19.011 --> 31:22.212
Treated a navy officer
stationed there three years ago.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.647
Lieutenant monica king.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.315
She came in
with a separated shoulder,

31:25.317 --> 31:28.352
But the doctors found ketamine
in her system.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.187
Why wasn't she treated on base?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.488
Well, that's
a question for her,

31:31.490 --> 31:33.490
Except she left the navy
two months later.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.426
Anyone on the <i>soteria</i> stationed
in san diego three years ago?

31:36.428 --> 31:38.128
No. It's the first thing
I checked.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.496
But if we can find monica king,

31:39.498 --> 31:41.665
Maybe she knows who drugged her.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.300
And who drugged holly, too.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.301
Come on. Let's go.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.369
Let's find her.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.116
Appreciate your time,
ms. King.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.484
I see you're having some
rough weather there.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.286
Aw, it's just
a little rain, sir.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.021
And it's "monica."

32:04.023 --> 32:06.657
But no need for small talk.
Agent on the phone

32:06.659 --> 32:08.592
Mentioned my tour in san diego?

32:08.594 --> 32:10.594
Uh, more specifically, monica,
a local clinic

32:10.596 --> 32:13.130
That you visited there
for a shoulder injury.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.133
And a drug test.

32:16.135 --> 32:19.169
We don't mean to
blindside you.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.237
You didn't.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.272
I had a feeling.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.941
Just, uh...

32:23.943 --> 32:26.143
Just kind of hard to believe
somebody over there

32:26.145 --> 32:28.946
Finally wants to hear
about this.

32:28.948 --> 32:32.683
It's however you
want to tell us.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.685
(sighs)

32:34.687 --> 32:37.087
Well, uh...

32:37.089 --> 32:40.223
The uss <i>panther</i> was in port,
and...

32:40.225 --> 32:43.427
Like always,
a few coworkers and I

32:43.429 --> 32:46.430
Hit the officers' club
just to say hi

32:46.432 --> 32:49.199
And have a drink
with some of their people.

32:49.201 --> 32:52.369
And, uh...
I had just started on...

32:52.371 --> 32:54.571
My second glass of wine

32:54.573 --> 32:58.108
When my eyes
got real, real heavy.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.744
I-I barely remember getting back
to my apartment across from base

33:00.746 --> 33:03.180
Before I-I just passed out.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.515
(sighs)

33:05.517 --> 33:08.518
And the, and the rest
is kind of sketchy.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.188
Just dark flashes and...

33:11.190 --> 33:14.324
A weight on me.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.328
My arm was twisted
real, real hard behind me...

33:18.330 --> 33:22.099
And, uh...

33:22.101 --> 33:24.334
(shuddering sigh)

33:25.703 --> 33:29.272
Do you really need
to hear about this?

33:29.274 --> 33:30.774
Did you know who it was?

33:30.776 --> 33:33.276
Never saw him.

33:33.278 --> 33:36.680
You know, I waited a day
to tell my xo.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.449
Stupid. He said

33:39.451 --> 33:43.220
Without a name,
what did I expect him to do?

33:43.222 --> 33:46.623
No. Rotc...

33:46.625 --> 33:49.226
Three years active duty,

33:49.228 --> 33:51.495
All my dreams

33:51.497 --> 33:53.497
Just over

33:53.499 --> 33:55.732
In one night.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.336
What's that xo's name?

33:59.338 --> 34:01.238
Rundy.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.242
I hear he's a captain now.
(cabot sighs)

34:05.244 --> 34:08.245
Cabot: Old-school, untrained,
insensitive...

34:09.414 --> 34:12.482
There's no rundy
on farrell's ship.

34:12.484 --> 34:16.119
I'll find him.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.825
Boss, I'm not finding anyone
named rundy on the uss <i>panther.</i>

34:21.827 --> 34:24.428
No, no, no-- rundy was
monica's base commander.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.264
We need to cross-check
the <i>soteria's</i> crew now

34:27.266 --> 34:29.199
With the <i>panther's</i> crew
from three years ago.

34:29.201 --> 34:32.269
Got it. Anyone that served
on both ships.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.337
(groans)
it's late.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.373
It is <i>not</i> too late.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.378
Oh, it's not too late at all.

34:42.346 --> 34:44.815
Who?

34:48.486 --> 34:50.320
This is nuts.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.721
Sit down.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.394
Really?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.496
What, was I not
helpful enough for you?

34:59.498 --> 35:00.730
No.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.400
No, you were very helpful.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.136
Let you search my ship,
question my guys.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.872
On what, the word
of one girl?

35:08.874 --> 35:11.274
Who's great and all,
but, come on,

35:11.276 --> 35:12.642
A whole month and a half later?

35:15.546 --> 35:18.215
Do you know this woman?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.516
You met her
three years ago

35:19.518 --> 35:21.518
In san diego,
when your previous ship,

35:21.520 --> 35:23.720
The <i>panther,</i> was moored there.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.622
No.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.624
I was on the <i>panther,</i>

35:27.626 --> 35:29.593
But I never laid eyes
on this girl.

35:29.595 --> 35:32.429
She wasn't a girl, wexler,
and neither is holly farrell.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.831
They were both navy officers

35:34.833 --> 35:37.334
When you laid
a lot more than eyes on 'em.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.668
Hey, back off.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.138
I put in 15 years
in seven different commands.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.140
I've worked with hundreds
of female j.O.'s.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.809
You think these two
somehow turned my head?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.612
We looked into those
seven commands, wexler,

35:48.614 --> 35:51.381
And we found a total of nine

35:51.383 --> 35:53.884
Female subordinates that were
assaulted in the same way.

35:56.521 --> 36:01.324
A good xo stays on top
of his crew on liberty.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.627
He pops into the
bars they hit.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.396
Maybe buys 'em
a round of drinks.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.865
If you even suggest

36:08.867 --> 36:11.535
That I'm a rapist,
which I am not,

36:11.537 --> 36:13.703
It'll kill my career.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.474
I don't recognize
any of these women.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.177
Because they're not unconscious?

36:20.179 --> 36:22.212
You son of a bitch...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.548
(grunts, gasps)

36:27.418 --> 36:30.487
You've been saving that one, mo.

36:30.489 --> 36:31.555
You have no idea.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.596
(sighs)

36:39.598 --> 36:42.499
(groans)
today is a much
better day.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.835
Understatement
of the year there, bish-op.
(chuckles)

36:45.837 --> 36:47.837
Just met with fred
the bartender's lawyer.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.640
He thinks the charge
will be reduced to
involuntary manslaughter.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.442
Tony:
Yeah.

36:52.444 --> 36:53.677
Sure beats
the alternative.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.845
Right?
Mm-hmm.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.315
You must be feeling good,
mr. Purple shirt.
Mm-hmm.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.983
Without your mad
computer skills,

36:59.985 --> 37:02.485
There would still be
a predator on the loose.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.653
(mcgee clears throat)

37:03.655 --> 37:05.322
Yeah.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.356
Yeah, it feels good.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.226
(sniffing)

37:11.662 --> 37:12.996
What is it?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.531
Nothing.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.674
Tony, I'm sorry.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.942
How long?

37:25.944 --> 37:28.778
Just this once?

37:28.780 --> 37:30.614
Okay, it's been the whole time.
But we...

37:30.616 --> 37:32.382
We've been working late.
I was weak.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.584
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.987
Wait, please,
I have another one-- here.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.788
Take it. It's yours.

37:40.558 --> 37:43.360
You can't buy me
with your pepperoni.

37:44.528 --> 37:46.363
I want a steak.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.465
And creamed spinach.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.434
And french fries.
Mmm.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.535
Can I get in on this?

37:52.537 --> 37:54.537
Yes. Absolutely.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.606
Steaks all around.
My treat. Let's go.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.674
Hmm.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.576
Okay.

38:00.745 --> 38:02.812
(tony sighs with relief)

38:04.282 --> 38:06.483
It's hard
to wrap my head around.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.551
I mean, the guy never
came across as a boy scout

38:08.553 --> 38:09.786
Or anything, but neither do

38:09.788 --> 38:11.054
Half my friends.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.722
Hard to know
some people.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.558
Yeah, especially
somebody like him. Ugh.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.761
And cabot
really cracked him?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.562
Okay...

38:19.564 --> 38:21.898
I'm really antiviolence,

38:21.900 --> 38:24.067
But it was awesome.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.436
I wish you could've
seen it.
Yeah, me, too.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.939
But I'll get my shots in
at his court-martial.

38:29.941 --> 38:33.677
Where are you heading?
Shipmates are having
a little memorial for tate

38:33.679 --> 38:36.680
Before he's sent back
to his family up in syracuse.

38:36.682 --> 38:40.517
There'll be a lot of talk about
wexler and what happened to you.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.652
You ready for that?

38:42.654 --> 38:44.621
Guess I'll just have to be.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.423
Do you need... Some
company or anything?

38:46.425 --> 38:48.058
No.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.559
I have a ride coming.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.994
Thanks for offering, abby.

38:50.996 --> 38:55.098
And, you know, for everything.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.372
She was right about you.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.008
Oh, well, she's right
about a lot of things.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.677
(quiet laugh)

39:12.683 --> 39:14.651
Hey, hol.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.653
Ready?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.603
(laughs)

39:33.605 --> 39:36.473
She just stole
your move.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.408
That was
totally a...

39:38.410 --> 39:41.010
Patented gibbs
head slap right there.
