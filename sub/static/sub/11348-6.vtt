WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

PERRY, TURN OFF THE CAMERA.

- CLASSIC.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.226
- CLOCK'S TICKING.

00:58.259 --> 01:02.230
IT'S THE NIGHT AFTER HALLOWEEN,
AND MIDNIGHT APPROACHES.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.632
OUR MISSION
IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.467
- COME ON, COME ON.
HURRY. COME ON.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.269
- GUYS, I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DO THIS.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.104
- OH, MY GOD.
COME ON. COME ON.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.071
- WE'RE GOING
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.307
- MIA, TELL YOUR SISTER
NOT TO BE SO SCARED.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.444
- YOU SAID
I COULD HAVE THE CAMERA.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.511
- I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
IN A MINUTE. GO.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.248
GET ACROSS US THE STREET.

01:20.281 --> 01:24.185
- WE'RE AT THE ENTRANCE
TO INWOOD HILL PARK.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.221
SOME PEOPLE REFUSE TO BELIEVE
HE EXISTS.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.191
SOME ARE AFRAID
TO SAY HIS NAME,

01:30.224 --> 01:32.360
BUT THERE'S
NO TURNING BACK NOW.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.296
BY DAWN,
WE WILL FIND GLASGOWMAN,

01:35.329 --> 01:37.231
AND OUR JOURNEY WILL BEGIN.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.401

- YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE NOW...

01:40.434 --> 01:43.171
BUT HE WOULDN'T CALL YOU
IF YOU WEREN'T READY.

COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.286
ARE WE CLOSE?
I'M COLD.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.254
- STOP ASKING
AND JUST KEEP GOING.

[eerie screeching]
- GET DOWN.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.367
KILL THE LIGHT.

I WANT TO GO BACK.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.939

DON'T LOOK!
- JUST KEEP GOING!

02:31.285 --> 02:32.886
- RUN! GO FASTER!
IT'S HIM!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.355
- HE'S CHASING US!

02:34.388 --> 02:35.489

03:34.682 --> 03:35.649
- A BIRDWATCHER FOUND HER?
HOW YOUNG IS THE GIRL?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.586
- NO I.D. ON HER--
MAYBE 10.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.554
HEAD TRAUMA, STABBED
MULTIPLE TIMES, CLOTHES TORN.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.590
- ALONE IN THE PARK AT DAWN--
MATCH ANY AMBER ALERTS?

03:42.623 --> 03:43.957
- NOTHING SO FAR.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.726
YOU'D THINK HER PARENTS
WOULD NOTICE HER MISSING.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.661
- YEAH, UNLESS THE PARENTS
ARE THE ONES WHO LEFT HER HERE.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.629
- THAT'S A CHEERFUL THOUGHT.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.464
I'M GOING TO RIDE ALONG,
SEE IF SHE COMES TO.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.300
- I'LL TALK TO BIRD LADY.
- RIGHT HERE.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.435
- ANY HOMELESS AROUND HERE OR...
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.370
- GO ROUND THEM UP.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.805
HI.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.307
THANK YOU.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.475
CAN YOU--CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU SAW, MA'AM?

04:01.509 --> 04:03.377
- I WAS WATCHING
A PURPLE FINCH--

04:03.411 --> 04:05.546
FIRST ONE OF THE SEASON--
ON THAT BRANCH THERE.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.014
- OKAY, AND THAT'S
WHEN YOU SAW THE GIRL?

04:07.047 --> 04:09.517
- THAT'S WHEN I SPOTTED HIM.
- "HIM"?

04:09.550 --> 04:12.320
- THE FINCH FLEW AWAY
WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.722
- OKAY, CAN YOU--
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.291
NOT THE BIRD, THE MAN.
- YES, OF COURSE.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.926
HE WAS HUGE, HULKING,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.695
HUNCHED OVER THE GIRL'S BODY
LIKE A TURKEY VULTURE.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.698
I YELLED FOR HIM TO SHOO,
AND HE TOOK OFF INTO THE WOODS.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.400
- DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD GIVE HIS DESCRIPTION

04:26.434 --> 04:27.435
TO A SKETCH ARTIST?

04:27.468 --> 04:29.603
- I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.672
I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.873
THEY'RE DIGITAL.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.810
[P.A. in background]

04:36.844 --> 04:39.313
- ALL RIGHT,
SO OUR SUSPECT'S BIGFOOT,

04:39.347 --> 04:40.848
AND OUR JANE DOE'S STILL
A JANE DOE.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.584
- CARISI REPORTED
HER DESCRIPTION.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.753
LOCAL PRECINCTS
ARE DISTRIBUTING IT NOW.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.756
HOW WAS CALIFORNIA?
- IT'S CONFUSING.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.691
ZARA'S THRIVING, THOUGH.
SHE LOVES IT THERE.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.725
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

04:51.759 --> 04:55.729
- OH, DOCTOR, HOW IS SHE?
- LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.698
ASIDE FROM THE HEAD TRAUMA,
ONE OF HER STAB WOUNDS

04:57.731 --> 04:59.633
WAS MILLIMETERS
FROM HER FEMORAL ARTERY.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.802
- WHAT ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT?
- NO VISIBLE SIGNS,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.804
BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR CONSENT TO DO A RAPE KIT.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.373
- WHEN CAN WE TALK TO HER?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.941
- SHE'S OUT OF SURGERY,
BUT SHE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.877
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- [sighs]

05:09.910 --> 05:11.779
- OKAY, DO WE CALL LIV IN
ON THIS?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.581

UM, YOU FOUND HER.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
IS THIS HER?
- IT COULD BE, YES.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.054
- OH, THANK GOD.
IS MIA WITH HER?

05:21.088 --> 05:22.756
- WHO'S MIA?
- HER BIG SISTER.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.425
IS SHE HERE TOO?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.626

WE'LL GET YOU IN THERE.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

05:30.498 --> 05:31.865
- SHE GOT HURT IN THE PARK
LAST NIGHT.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.434
- W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN HURT?
WHAT PARK?

05:33.467 --> 05:34.735
- BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.604
- JOAN, JOAN,
LET THEM ASK THE QUESTIONS.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.372
- DO YOU KNOW HOW YOUR DAUGHTER
COULD HAVE ENDED UP

05:38.406 --> 05:39.573
IN THE PARK ALONE?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.642
THEY BOTH WENT TO A SLEEPOVER
AT THEIR FRIEND'S HOUSE--

05:41.675 --> 05:42.776
PERRY GILBERT.
- OKAY.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
- BUT THEY DIDN'T ANSWER
THEIR CELL PHONES THIS MORNING.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.679
- DID YOU CALL PERRY'S PARENTS?

05:45.713 --> 05:47.581
- NO. SHE'S A SINGLE MOM.
WE CALLED. WE TEXTED.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.582
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING--

05:48.616 --> 05:49.417
291 DYCKMAN--

05:49.450 --> 05:51.084
- OKAY.
- NO ONE ANSWERED THE DOOR,

05:51.118 --> 05:53.621
BUT OUR TRACKER APP SAYS
THE GIRLS' PHONES ARE INSIDE.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.622
- OKAY.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.390
OKAY, LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO TRY AND STAY CALM.

GET CADETS OUT THERE,
AUXILIARY, SCOUTS.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.045
- OFFICERS,
THE LITTLE GIRL'S CONSCIOUS.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.947
HER MOTHERS ARE WITH HER.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.084
- IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.087
- WHAT WASN'T YOUR IDEA, ZOE?

09:14.121 --> 09:17.658
- MIA TOOK MOM'S PHONE
AND TEXTED PERRY'S MOM

09:17.691 --> 09:19.893
SAYING THAT SHE COULD SLEEP OVER
AT OUR HOUSE.

09:19.927 --> 09:24.264
- NO. HER MOM TEXTED ME THAT
YOU TWO WERE SAYING WITH HER.

09:24.297 --> 09:28.101
- [sighs] THAT WAS PERRY
PRETENDING TO BE HER MOM.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.037
THEY MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.972
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, ZOE?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.140
- JOAN, NOT NOW.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.909
- LISTEN, ZOE,
WE'RE NOT ANGRY AT YOU.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.778
- YEAH, WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU ENDED UP

09:37.811 --> 09:38.946
IN THE PARK LAST NIGHT.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.218
- THEY WERE GOING, AND THEY SAID
I COULDN'T BE LEFT ALONE.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.453
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.622
YOU KNOW YOUR SISTER DOESN'T
THINK STRAIGHT ALL THE TIME--

09:48.656 --> 09:50.323
- MA'AM, MA'AM, CAN WE JUST--
CAN WE TALK OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

09:50.357 --> 09:54.094
- I AM NOT LEAVING MY DAUGHTER.
- JOAN, MIA IS STILL OUT THERE.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.297
LET THE POLICE DO THEIR JOB.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.635
- ZOE, ZOE, LISTEN TO ME.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.336
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY TROUBLE,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.706
BUT WE NEED YOU TO HELP US FIND
YOUR SISTER, OKAY?

10:05.739 --> 10:06.907
[door closes]

10:06.940 --> 10:10.377
- SO WHY DID PERRY AND MIA
WANT TO GO TO THE PARK AT NIGHT?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.848
- THEY SAID
IT WOULD BE SCARY...

10:14.882 --> 10:16.950
THE NIGHT AFTER HALLOWEEN.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.653
THE SPIRITS WERE STILL OUT...

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
ZOMBIES.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.691
FUN SCARY.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.358
- RIGHT, SPIRITS.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.428
OKAY, SO WHAT WAS THE PLAN?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.798
- WE LEFT AT MIDNIGHT.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.768
PERRY HAD A CAMERA, JUST IN CASE
WE SAW SOMEBODY SCARY.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.904
SHE SAID WE WERE GOING
TO SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.373
- AND DID YOU?
DID YOU SEE SOMEBODY--A ZOMBIE?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.009
- THEY DID.

10:42.042 --> 10:46.246
THEY WERE SCREAMING,
"RUN, ZOE! RUN!"

10:46.279 --> 10:50.918
BUT HE CAUGHT ME
AND KNOCKED ME DOWN.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.920
- YOU SAW HIM?

10:52.953 --> 10:56.023
ZOE, YOU SAW HIS FACE?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.725
- YES.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.460
IT WAS THE GLASGOWMAN.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.363
- OUR SUSPECT MAY LIVE
IN THESE WOODS.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.698
HE IS OVER 6 FOOT.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.000
HE'S HEAVYSET.
HE'S BALD.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.902
- HE MAY GO
BY THE NAME GLASGOWMAN.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.704
HE MAY HAVE A SCAR
FROM EAR TO EAR.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.305
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

11:12.339 --> 11:14.808
THE VIC DESCRIBES HIM
AS WEARING AN EYE PATCH.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.277
- THIS IS AN ACTIVE SEARCH
FOR TWO GIRLS, WHITE.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.314
MIA HARRIS, SHE'S 12,
RED HAIR, BLUE EYES, OKAY?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.316
SHE'S 5'3", AND THEN
WE GOT PERRY GILBERT.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.419
SHE'S 13, DARK HAIR, BLUE EYES,
5 FEET EVEN.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.321
GOT IT?
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.456
WE'RE GOING TO FAN OUT.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.259
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO
THE WOODS FROM THE NORTH SIDE.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.042
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.844
- HEY.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.145
A CHILD'S BACKPACK.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.914
- GUYS, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.282
OVER HERE!

11:55.315 --> 11:56.850
- DETECTIVES!

11:56.884 --> 12:00.821
THE CADETS
THINK THEY FOUND SOMETHING.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.156
- HEY, GET THIS TO CSU.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.958
- CADETS SAW SOMEONE
RUN INTO THAT CAVE.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.860
HE WON'T COME OUT.
- IS HE ARMED?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.328
- I DON'T KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.030
NYPD.
LET'S GET ON OUT OF THERE.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.899
- HANDS IN THE AIR.
[man grunting]

12:11.932 --> 12:13.533
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
WE WANT HIM ALIVE, OKAY?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.002
- I SAID HANDS UP.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.436
GET ON THE GROUND, NOW!
- OKAY. HOLD ON.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.537
TAKE IT EASY, MY FRIEND.
TAKE IT EASY.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.638
- GET OUT OF HERE!
- ALL RIGHT.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.341
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, COME ON.
COME OUT NICE AND EASY.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.810
NO ONE GETS HURT.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.444
- PUT THE STICK DOWN,
GET ON THE GROUND,

12:24.477 --> 12:27.781
OR I WILL TASE YOUR ASS.
PUT IT DOWN--LET'S GO!

12:27.815 --> 12:31.084
GET OUT OF HERE!
[Taser clicking]

12:31.118 --> 12:32.519
- HE'S NOT GOING DOWN!
- WELL, STOP IT!

12:32.552 --> 12:36.189
TURN THE DAMN THING OFF!
- HEY, ENOUGH, ENOUGH!

12:36.223 --> 12:37.958
- STAY ON THE GROUND, SIR.
STAY ON THE GROUND.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.860
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.929
- ALL RIGHT. EASY, EASY.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.797
DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE.
[man muttering]

12:43.831 --> 12:45.899
NO ONE GETS HURT, ALL RIGHT?

12:45.933 --> 12:49.169
- JUST RELAX, JUST RELAX.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

12:58.345 --> 12:58.545
.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.379
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS MAN
IN MY LIFE.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.381
- HE TOOK PERRY?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.583
- WE DON'T KNOW.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.886
- IT'S TOO LATE, RICK.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.187
[voice breaking]
THEY'VE GOT HIM.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.158
THEY DON'T HAVE THE GIRLS.
THEY'RE GONE.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
HE KILLED THEM!

13:18.298 --> 13:19.900
- SHE DOESN'T PLACE HIM?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.135
- NO. ZOE'S CONVINCED IT'S HIM
AND THAT HE'S GLASGOWMAN,

13:22.169 --> 13:24.271
BUT SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
BEING STABBED.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.474
[door opens]
- PERRY'S MOM--NO HELP.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.442
HER BOYFRIEND'S GOT HIS HANDS
FULL WITH THAT ONE.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.311
- OKAY.
WHAT DO WE HAVE ON GLASGOWMAN?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.479
- CHARLIE DORSEY, HE'S 36.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.247
THE LOCAL PRECINCT'S SEEN HIM

13:34.281 --> 13:36.149
RUMMAGING THROUGH THE GARBAGE,
COLLECTING CANS.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.085
- FREQUENT-FLIER
AT THE HUDSON RIVER STATE ASYLUM

13:38.118 --> 13:39.987
UNTIL THEY DUMPED HIM BACK
ON THE STREETS

13:40.020 --> 13:41.388
WHEN IT CLOSED DOWN IN 2003.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.489
- AFTER THAT,
HE STOPS TAKING HIS MEDS,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.457
JUMPS THE COUCH A FEW TIMES.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.426
IT'S MINOR STUFF FIRST,
THEN AMPS IT UP.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.496
SUBWAY ASSAULTS, THEN HE STABS
A GUY IN THE KIDNEY

13:49.529 --> 13:52.165
AT A HOMELESS CENTER SHELTER,
GETS A THREE-YEAR BID IN ATTICA.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.433
- HE GETS RELEASED
TWO YEARS AGO,

13:53.466 --> 13:55.068
MEETS ONCE WITH HIS P.O.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.536
AND THEN
GOES OFF THE GRID UNTIL TODAY.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.138
- IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.040
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T UNSCREW
THE TOP OF THE SALT SHAKER

14:00.073 --> 14:02.009
AND THEN BE SURPRISED WHEN IT
SPILLS ALL OVER THE TABLE.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.111
- ALL RIGHT.
DO WE HAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

14:04.144 --> 14:05.478
LINKING HIM TO ZOE'S ASSAULT?

14:05.512 --> 14:06.947
- NO SIGN OF THE WEAPON,

14:06.980 --> 14:08.348
NEGATIVE ON THE RAPE KIT,

14:08.381 --> 14:10.317
AND WE'RE RUNNING
HIS CLOTHES NOW FOR DNA,

14:10.350 --> 14:11.518
AND THAT EYE PATCH
IS JUST FOR SHOW.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.954
HE GOT EXTREMELY AGITATED
WHEN WE TRIED TO TAKE IT OFF.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.155
- FIND ANYTHING IN THAT CAVE?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.324
- NO, IT'S TINY--
A SPIDER HOLE.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.359
- WELL, HE LIVES IN THAT PARK.
HE'S GOT TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.895
- WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING YET.
LOOK, THOSE WOODS ARE DENSE.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.363
IT'S THE LAST PRIMEVAL FOREST
IN THE AREA.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.965
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME--
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.267
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT PERRY OR MIA?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.069
- NO. HE CLAMMED UP.
HE CLAIMS HE HAS NO IDEA.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.370
- OKAY, WHY DON'T
I TAKE A RUN AT HIM?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.204
- NO DISRESPECT, NICK,

14:31.238 --> 14:33.006
BUT I-I THINK
HE TRUSTS ME, SARGE.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.076
- WAIT.
YOU JUST SAID HE CLAMMED UP.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.513
- ROLLINS?

14:40.547 --> 14:44.517
- UH, CARISI DID GET THEM
TO STOP TASERING,

14:44.551 --> 14:47.320
UM, HELPED TALK HIM DOWN.
- OKAY, GUYS,

14:47.354 --> 14:51.091
IT'S BEEN OVER 12 HOURS
SINCE TWO GIRLS WENT MISSING.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.593
[sighs]
CARISI, LET'S GO.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.598
[loud clatter]
- TAKE IT EASY. TAKE IT EASY.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.533
- DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE,
MR. DORSEY?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.469
- NO, THIS AIN'T RIGHT.
THIS JUST--THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.271
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
[mumbling]

15:04.304 --> 15:07.407
- I CAN SEE THAT THE CUFFS
ARE PULLING AT YOU.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.542
HOW ABOUT YOU ANSWER
SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS

15:09.576 --> 15:11.478
AND MAYBE
WE CAN TAKE THOSE OFF?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.246
- WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO BOND
WITH ME, LITTLE SISTER?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.614
LEAD ME IN WITH THE CHAIN
AND THEN CHAIN ME UP

15:14.647 --> 15:17.017
LIKE I'M A--
LIKE I'M A JUNKYARD DOG?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.186
I'M NOT--
[howling]

15:19.219 --> 15:21.354
- WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
DOWN, BOY.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.090
BE GOOD. BE GOOD.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.357
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT.

15:24.391 --> 15:28.395
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE TRUE
IF I WERE HERE.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.397
- OKAY.
UH, MR. DORSEY?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.365
- CHARLIE.
CALL--CALL ME CHARLIE.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.168
MY FATHER WAS MR. DORSEY.
- OKAY, CHARLIE...

15:35.202 --> 15:37.504
SO WHERE IS IT THAT YOU THINK
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.639
- I DON'T HAVE TO THINK.
I KNOW WHO YOU BOTH ARE,

15:39.672 --> 15:41.541
AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN
ON YOUR WATCH LIST

15:41.574 --> 15:43.443
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.377
- WHOSE WATCH LIST?

15:44.411 --> 15:46.413
- THEY--THEY--THEY WANT
TO TELL ME THAT--

15:46.446 --> 15:47.414
THAT I'M HEARING VOICES,

15:47.447 --> 15:50.984
AND THEY WANT TO KEEP ME
IN THE SYSTEM FOREVER.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.720
NO.
NO, NO, NO.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.523
THAT'S WHAT
THEY WERE SAYING ABOUT ME

15:56.556 --> 15:59.259
BEHIND WINDOW NUMBER ONE...

15:59.292 --> 16:02.029
SAYING I STABBED A GUY...

16:02.062 --> 16:03.530
LIKE THAT DEFINES A MAN.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.032
WELL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

16:05.065 --> 16:06.066
IF YOU CAN LIVE
ON THIS PLANET

16:06.099 --> 16:07.367
AND NOT BE
EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.403
THEN YOU'RE NOT
A REAL HUMAN BEING.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.272
- OKAY, CHAR--CHARLIE?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.541
HEY, HEY.
YOU'RE RIGHT, BIG BROTHER.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.475
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.377
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
FOR A LONG TIME,

16:17.410 --> 16:21.348
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY
WE HAD TO BRING YOU HERE TODAY?

16:21.381 --> 16:25.218
- IT'S BECAUSE I SAW THE PLANE
GO DOWN ON THE HUDSON RIVER.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.419
THE OFFICIAL STORY WAS GEESE,

16:26.453 --> 16:29.222
BUT I SAW THE MISSILE GO OFF
AND KNOCK IT OUT OF THE SKY,

16:29.256 --> 16:31.058
AND THEY KNOW THAT I KNOW
THAT THE PLAN

16:31.091 --> 16:32.392
IS TO ERASE IT FROM MY MEMORY,

16:32.425 --> 16:35.128
FIRST USING THE MEDS

16:35.162 --> 16:39.066
AND THEN USING THE LASERS
ON THESE LITTLE CELLULAR PHONES

16:39.099 --> 16:42.135
THAT EVERYBODY HAS,
BUT I WILL NOT FORGET.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.503
I AM A LOYAL--

16:43.536 --> 16:45.405
I AM A LOYAL AMERICAN.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.275
* MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE...

16:48.308 --> 16:50.710
- OKAY, CHARLIE?
CHARLIE, CHARLIE.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.512
CHARLIE, CAN YOU LOOK AT ME
FOR A SECOND?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.381
CHARLIE?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.483
LISTEN TO ME.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.451
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU,

16:58.485 --> 16:59.786
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING
TO PROTECT YOU,

16:59.819 --> 17:01.020
OKAY?
- YEAH.

17:01.054 --> 17:05.258
NOW, I NEED YOU TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE THREE GIRLS, OKAY?

17:05.292 --> 17:07.094
- NO. NO.
- IT'S OKAY.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.430
LOOK, CHARLIE, THIS PHONE DOES
NOT HAVE LASERS IN IT, OKAY?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.532
I PROMISE YOU.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.567
SO I JUST--I NEED YOU TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THESE--

17:14.601 --> 17:16.303
AT THESE THREE GIRLS.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.271
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

17:18.305 --> 17:20.840
TELL ME IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN
THEM BEFORE.

17:20.873 --> 17:25.178
ONE, TWO, THREE.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.415
- NO, NO. I'VE NEVER--I'VE NEVER
SEEN THESE GIRLS BEFORE.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.684
I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR THIS.
THEY CAN'T TRAP ME LIKE THEY DO.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.455
- HEY, CHARLIE.
CHARLIE, CHARLIE, HEY.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.458
I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO US, PLEASE, OKAY?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.560
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO HAND YOU BACK TO THEM.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.528
- NO.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.563
- OKAY, I NEED YOU TO TELL ME

17:43.596 --> 17:47.734
ABOUT THE GIRL YOU WERE WITH
IN THE WOODS THIS MORNING.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.438
- OH, HER.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.274
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.109
SHE SMELLED LIKE STRAWBERRIES.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.545
- MM-HMM.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.747
- BUT I KNEW
THAT IF THEY FOUND HER NEAR ME

18:00.780 --> 18:03.183
THAT THEY WOULD ACCUSE ME
OF STABBING HER.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.016
- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

18:04.050 --> 18:05.485
- WHAT,
ARE YOU CALLING ME VIOLENT?

18:05.518 --> 18:06.886
- NOBODY SAID THAT.
- WE ALL HEARD IT.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.755
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.

18:08.788 --> 18:12.525
I DID NOT HURT
THAT LITTLE GIRL.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.893
I FOUND HER BLEEDING,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.829
AND AS THE LAST GOOD SAMARITAN
IN THIS DYING SOCIETY,

18:16.863 --> 18:18.398
I ALONE SAVED HER.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.433
- YEAH, AND IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU DID, CHARLIE,

18:20.467 --> 18:22.369
'CAUSE SHE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.303
- THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.706
- DID YOU SAVE
THE OTHER TWO GIRLS ALSO?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.541
- NO. NO.
WHAT OTHER GIRLS?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.343
I ONLY TOLD YOU
THAT I FOUND THE ONE,

18:30.377 --> 18:33.346
AND YOU FILMED THE WHOLE THING
ANYWAY ON THE DEVICE.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.315
- THE DEVICE?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.250
CHARLIE WHAT DEVICE?
- I FOUND IT.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.519
YOUR PEOPLE INSTALLED IT,
BUT I HAVE IT NOW.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.321
- OKAY.
INSTALLED IT WHERE?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.523
- INSIDE OF MY DWELLING.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.460
THEY NEED AN EXCUSE
TO RANSACK MY DOMAIN.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.629
- SERGEANT,
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.664
HOW ABOUT I TAKE CHARLIE
UP THERE?

18:51.698 --> 18:52.599
IF HE DIDN'T SEE THOSE GIRLS,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.601
THEN THE DEVICE
IS GOING TO SHOW US THAT.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.404
- YES. THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.
I LIKE THAT.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.273
I WILL--I WILL NEED MY EYE PATCH
BACK FOR THAT, THOUGH.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.808
- OKAY, CHARLIE.
I THINK WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.178
- OH, GOOD.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.480
YOU GUYS SEE?

19:07.514 --> 19:11.318
DO YOU SEE THIS?

19:11.351 --> 19:14.153
DON'T THREATEN ME
WITH MEDICATION.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.201
.

19:28.235 --> 19:28.635
- IT'S DOWN THERE.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.604
- WHERE?
- UNDER THE KUDZU.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.307
- ALL RIGHT, SHOW US.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.878
- LITTLE BROTHER, I NEED YOU
TO SWITCH MY EYE PATCH

19:38.911 --> 19:40.580
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.349
- SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE DARK?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.285
YEAH, I GET IT.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.387
ALL RIGHT,
THE DEVICE, CHARLIE--

19:47.420 --> 19:48.521
WHERE IS IT?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.857
- IT'S THE THIRD BAG
ON THE LEFT.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.667
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.834
- OKAY.
CALM DOWN.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.472
THIS IS JUST SO WE CAN PROVE
THAT IT WAS PLANTED HERE.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.607
- OKAY.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.912
- OKAY. WE GOT IT.
GOOD JOB, CHARLIE.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.315
HEY, ROLLINS, I WANT
24-HOUR GUARD ON THIS PLACE.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.250
NOBODY DISTURBS A THING
UNTIL CHARLIE HERE IS RELEASED.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.318
- ALL RIGHT, I'M ON IT.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.753
- OKAY, CHARLIE, LOOK AT ME.
YOU DID REALLY GOOD.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.022
- HEY, GET CSU DOWN HERE
RIGHT NOW.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.525
- NO. YOU--YOU--YOU
AND YOUR PEOPLE CAN GO NOW.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.659
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.296
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T LET
YOU DO THAT.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.963
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
COME ON.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.333
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OKAY. YOU GUYS GO ON AHEAD.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.303
I'LL STAY AND MAKE SURE
NOBODY COMES IN, ALL RIGHT?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.605
- OKAY.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.873
I NEED YOU TO SWITCH MY EYE
PATCH OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.809
I DON'T WANT THE SUN
TO BLIND ME.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.750
- LET'S GO, CHARLIE.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.477
- OH, NO.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.427
- HEY, SO NO TRACE
OF THE OTHER GIRLS

21:34.461 --> 21:36.095
IN OR AROUND HIS ENCAMPMENT,

21:36.128 --> 21:37.897
AND THE DOGS DIDN'T PICK UP
ANY SCENT EITHER.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.399
- WHAT ABOUT THE KNIFE?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.501
- CHARLIE CLAIMS
THEY'RE FOR HUNTING AND FISHING

21:41.534 --> 21:43.503
AND THAT THE BLOOD
ON THE KNIFE IS FROM BLUEFISH.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.606
- WE'RE RUNNING IT NOW
FOR PRINTS AND DNA.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.875
CSU IS STILL THERE
GOING OVER HIS PLACE.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.009
- AND THIS DEVICE?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.044
- IT'S A HANDHELD ZOOM CAMERA.
IT'S PRETTY DINGED UP.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.080
WE SENT IT TO TARU.
- COULD BE THE GIRLS'.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.047
[cell phone chimes]

21:55.081 --> 21:57.950
ZOE TOLD US PERRY HAD A CAMERA

21:57.984 --> 22:00.453
- THESE GUYS ARE GOOD.
TARU'S ALREADY GOT SOMETHING.

22:07.093 --> 22:10.830
- TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
TO INWOOD HILL PARK.

22:10.863 --> 22:15.535
GLASGOWMAN WILL MEET US THERE
AND TAKE US TO HIS MANSION.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.670
- I DON'T WANT TO.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.105
- CLOCK'S TICKING.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.875
IT'S THE NIGHT AFTER HALLOWEEN,
AND MIDNIGHT APPROACHES.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.612
OUR MISSION
IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.114
- WHERE'S THE MAP?

22:28.147 --> 22:31.384
WHERE'S THE MAP?
- YOUR SISTER PROBABLY LOST IT.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.919
- DID NOT.
MIA TOOK IT.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.389
- I DID NOT.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.957
- MAP?
MANSION?

22:37.990 --> 22:41.127
- [sighs]
ZOE DIDN'T MENTION ANY OF THIS.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.596
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I ALREADY BROKE THE PACT.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.031
- ZOE, STOP THIS.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.534
YOU TELL THE POLICE
WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW.

22:47.567 --> 22:51.438
WHERE WERE YOU GIRLS GOING?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.005
- THE GATEWAY.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.074
- "THE GATEWAY"?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.809
- IT'S WHERE YOU MEET
GLASGOWMAN

22:56.843 --> 22:58.745
BEFORE YOU CAN GO
INTO HIS MANSION.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.147
- OKAY, SO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS MANSION.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.416
- BUT IF HE FINDS OUT

- ZOE, PLEASE.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.658
- OKAY.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.427
IF GLASGOWMAN LIKES YOU,
YOU GET TO LIVE IN HIS MANSION--

23:14.461 --> 23:16.596
NO RULES, NO SCHOOL,

23:16.629 --> 23:19.131
AND THERE ARE PORTALS INSIDE
TO OTHER REALMS,

23:19.165 --> 23:21.200
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.102
- OKAY.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.004
ZOE WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS MAP?

23:25.037 --> 23:28.575
WAS IT ON THE INTERNET?
WAS IT AT THE LIBRARY?

23:28.608 --> 23:30.477
- FROM LESLIE.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.179
- LESLIE?

WHAT HAPPENED TO ALICIA?

23:36.082 --> 23:39.051
- SHE QUIT A FEW MONTHS AGO.
PERRY'S HAD A LOT OF SITTERS.

23:39.085 --> 23:39.886

23:42.555 --> 23:45.892

23:45.925 --> 23:47.594
HE'S A BOY.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.463
HE'S REALLY NEAT--
TELLS A LOT OF SCARY STORIES.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.603
[knock at door]

24:01.240 --> 24:03.510
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW THEM?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.211
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.
TUESDAY MAYBE?

24:05.244 --> 24:06.245
- IS THAT WHEN YOU
GAVE THEM THE MAP?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.047
- WHAT?
- THAT MANSION--

24:08.080 --> 24:09.081
WHERE IS IT?

24:09.115 --> 24:11.718
- OH, IT DOESN'T EXIST.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.219
IT'S ALL IN HERE.
- HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.821
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.490
THOSE GIRLS WENT INTO THE WOODS
WITH YOUR MAP

24:17.524 --> 24:19.125
LOOKING FOR GLASGOWMAN.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.827
- YOU TELL THEM TO DO THAT?
YOU MEET THEM THERE?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.062
- WHAT? NO. NO.
GLASGOWMAN ISN'T REAL.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.031
- NO?
RECOGNIZE HIM?

24:25.064 --> 24:26.966
WE HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY.
- YOU ARRESTED CHARLIE.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.034
- OH, SO YOU DO KNOW HIM.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.769
- HE'S HOMELESS.
I BRING HIM FOOD.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.103
HE TELLS ME CRAZY STORIES.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.739
THE KIDS CALL HIM GLASGOWMAN.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.542
I JUST AMPED IT UP,
CREATED THE LORE.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.510
- THE LORE?
ZOE GOT STABBED.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.011
SHE ALMOST DIED.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.513
- STABBED?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.081
YOU CAN'T THINK I HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.082
I ADORE ZOE.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.151
- IS THAT WHY YOU DREW HER HERE
COVERED IN BLOOD

24:45.184 --> 24:46.753
WITH PERRY AND MIA?

24:46.786 --> 24:48.921
- LOOK, PERRY LIKES
SCARY STORIES.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.256
I STARTED TO TURN THEM
INTO A GRAPHIC NOVEL,

24:50.289 --> 24:52.559
BUT IT'S ALL FICTION.
- YEAH, FICTION.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.126
SO WHAT'S THE PLOT?
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GIRLS?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.828
- THERE'S, LIKE, SIX BOOKS.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.264
I JUST STARTED EDITING
IT ALL THIS WEEKEND.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.032
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.802
- THEY SAID THEY WERE LOOKING
FOR GLASGOWMAN'S MANSION, OKAY?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.672
AND WE KNOW
THAT THEY WERE USING YOUR MAP.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.206
- HEY, I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU AGAIN.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.842
WHERE'S THE MAP?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.010
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.011
- RIP THIS PLACE APART
UNTIL WE FIND IT.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.245
- NO, NO, NO!
PLEASE, PLEASE,

25:13.279 --> 25:16.182
PLEASE, NO! PLEASE, WAIT.
DON'T. DON'T.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.316
- IS THIS IT?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.686
IS THIS THE MAP?
- OKAY, OKAY, HERE...

25:19.719 --> 25:22.121
IN THE STORY,
GLASGOWMAN GOES OVER THE BRIDGE

25:22.154 --> 25:23.623
AND THEN UP AND DOWN THE RIVER.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.793
THAT'S THIS LIZARD'S TAIL.
- WAIT.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.829
IT'S GOT TO BE THE HUDSON.
- UH-HUH.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.163
- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE?

25:31.197 --> 25:34.701
- THIS IS THE GATEWAY
TO THE MANSION.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.069
IT'S LIKE THE PORTAL
TO THE OTHER REALMS.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.304
I BASED IT OFF OF ONE
OF CHARLIE'S HIDEOUTS.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.839
- OKAY, SO WHERE IS IT?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.108
- IT'S UPRIVER SOMEWHERE--
SPUYTEN DUYVIL PARK.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.144
[camera shutter clicks]

25:48.247 --> 25:50.016
- WHAT IS THAT DOWN THERE?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.919
- COULD BE THE GATEWAY.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.823
- PERRY? MIA?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.190
- HEADS UP.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.195
PERRY?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.263
MIA?

26:04.296 --> 26:07.800
- OH, NO, I GOT A KNIFE...

26:07.834 --> 26:09.769
AND A DEAD CAT.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.270
- THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

26:11.303 --> 26:14.306
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S GET
THIS BAGGED AND TAGGED FOR CSU.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.679
- PERRY?

26:23.215 --> 26:25.184
MIA?

26:30.790 --> 26:33.793
HEY. HEY!

26:33.826 --> 26:35.762
A LITTLE HELP IN HERE!

26:35.795 --> 26:37.163
- WE GOT BOTH OF THEM.

26:37.196 --> 26:40.266
- OH, MY GOD.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.133
- OH, GEEZ.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.268
- MIA?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.070
- CALL A BUS.
- [wheezing]

26:44.103 --> 26:45.705
- MIA.
PERRY.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.907
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- HELP US.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.241
HELP US.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.912
- PERRY.
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

26:52.945 --> 26:56.248
- YES.
- WHO DID THIS TO YOU, BABY?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.050
- GLASGOWMAN.

26:58.084 --> 27:01.320
HE SAID HE WAS COMING BACK
TO BLEED THE DEVIL OUT OF US,

27:14.333 --> 27:14.734
.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.367
- WE WERE RUNNING IN THE WOODS,

27:16.335 --> 27:20.072
AND GLASGOWMAN SAW US,
AND HE STARTED CHASING,

27:20.106 --> 27:22.809
AND WE RAN,
AND I TRIED TO DRAG ZOE,

27:22.842 --> 27:24.276
BUT SHE TRIPPED AND FELL,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.078
AND PERRY SAID
HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND US,

27:26.112 --> 27:27.947
SO I JUST KEPT RUNNING.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.017
MOMMY, I'M REALLY SORRY, OKAY?
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.885
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, HONEY.
JUST--

27:32.919 --> 27:36.856
JUST TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.759
- WE WENT BACK,
AND I SAW HIM OVER ZOE'S BODY,

27:39.792 --> 27:41.928
AND HE WAS JUST
GOING BALLISTIC.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.797
HE WAS JUST STABBING
AND STABBING.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.333
- OKAY, OKAY.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.735
- AND I YELLED,
"LEAVE HER ALONE!"

27:48.768 --> 27:52.038
AND THEN HE CAME AFTER US,

27:52.071 --> 27:55.241
AND HE CAUGHT US BOTH,
AND HE SHOWED US HIS KNIFE,

27:55.274 --> 27:56.743
AND HE SAID
THAT IF WE DIDN'T GO WITH HIM,

27:56.776 --> 27:58.177
HE WAS GOING TO BLEED US OUT
RIGHT THERE.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.846
- DEAR GOD.

27:59.879 --> 28:03.916
- AND THAT'S WHEN HE MARCHED YOU
UP TO SPUYTEN DUYVIL PARK.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.018
- AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH ZOE?

28:08.788 --> 28:11.858
- HE COVERED HER WITH LEAVES
AND LEFT HER THERE.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.962
- WE WERE WALKING
FOR, LIKE, HOURS,

28:15.995 --> 28:17.797
BUT BEFORE WE GOT
TO THE MANSION,

28:17.830 --> 28:19.298
MIA STARTED CRYING.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.868
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO GO HOME.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.870
THIS REALLY MADE
GLASGOWMAN MAD.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.038
HE WENT BALLISTIC.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.975
- BALLISTIC?

28:29.008 --> 28:30.743
WHAT DID HE DO?

28:30.777 --> 28:32.879
- HE FORCED US
INTO THE GATEHOUSE.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.848
HE THREW US DOWN AND THEN
THREATENED US WITH HIS KNIFE.

28:35.882 --> 28:39.485
HE TIED MIA UP AND SAID
WE WEREN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.954
- BUT HE DIDN'T TIE YOU UP?
- NO.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.490
HE TRIED TO,
BUT I WAS FIGHTING HIM OFF.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.459
HE SAID HE HEARD HELICOPTERS,

28:47.493 --> 28:50.129
SO HE STABBED ME.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.132
THEN HE KILLED THE CAT,
AND THEN HE TOOK OFF.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.268
- OKAY. PERRY, DID YOU SEE
HIM KILL THE CAT?

28:56.302 --> 28:57.970
- NO, I HEARD IT.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.872
- MM-HMM.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.041
- AND WHEN DID
ALL THIS HAPPEN?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.844
- LAST NIGHT, SO SUNDAY NIGHT.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.315
- OKAY, WELL,
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

29:09.348 --> 29:10.817
THAT WE GOT THE RIGHT GUY.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.084
- I-I'M REALLY TIRED.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.420
CAN THIS WAIT?
- LOOK, YOU ALREADY HAVE HIM.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.156
LET MY DAUGHTER REST.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.457
- WAIT.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.827
YOU HAVE GLASGOWMAN?

29:20.860 --> 29:23.129
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL US?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.970
- OH, MY GOD.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.005
HOW DID YOU GET THIS CLOSE?

29:35.107 --> 29:38.577
- PERRY, ARE YOU SURE
THAT THAT'S HIM?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.913
- A MILLION PERCENT.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.916
THE SCAR, THE BEARD--
HE HAD AN EYE PATCH TOO.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.117
I'M NOT JOKING.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.485
YOU HAVE TO LOCK HIM UP.

29:46.518 --> 29:50.522
HE SAID HE'D KILL ME
IF I TOLD ANYONE WHAT HAPPENED.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.959
- THEY'RE SUFFERING
FROM EXPOSURE AND DEHYDRATION.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.394
THEY HAD FOOD IN THEIR
BACKPACKS--MOSTLY CANDY.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.830
- AND THE STAB WOUNDS
ON PERRY?

29:57.864 --> 29:59.065
- NOT AS DEEP
AS THE ONES ON ZOE--

29:59.098 --> 30:02.468
ALL ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER BODY
MOSTLY THE ARMS, NO ORGANS.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.870
- RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE?

30:03.903 --> 30:05.304
- PERRY WAS DISORIENTED.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.873
SHE SAID SHE WAS ATTACKED
LAST NIGHT,

30:06.906 --> 30:09.575
BUT THERE WAS NO INFLAMMATION,
NO BRUISING.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.843
THESE INJURIES ARE FRESH.

30:10.877 --> 30:14.914
I'D SAY AN HOUR OLD,
TWO AT THE MOST.

30:14.947 --> 30:18.617
- AND--AND, DOCTOR,
ANY DEFENSIVE WOUNDS?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.853
- NO.
NONE, ACTUALLY.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.156
- IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.
- HEY,

30:24.190 --> 30:25.557
HOW DID IT GO WITH THE GIRLS?

30:25.591 --> 30:27.226
- THE TIMELINE IS WAY OFF.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.460
THEY'RE BOTH BLAMING CHARLIE.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.229
WE'VE HAD HIM IN CUSTODY
SINCE SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.297
- WELL, THEY MAY JUST BE
CONFUSED.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.531
HE COULD HAVE WALKED THEM
UP THERE

30:32.564 --> 30:34.600
AND THEN GOT BACK TO INWOOD
BY THE TIME WE PICKED HIM UP.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.169
- EXCEPT THE DOCTOR JUST TOLD ME
PERRY'S WOUNDS ARE FRESH.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.871
- OKAY, SO THEY'RE COVERING
FOR SOMEONE.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.206
- WHO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.573
MAYBE IT'S A "ROMEO AND JULIET"
KIND OF THING?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.876
TWO GIRLS GO OFF TO BE
WITH SOME SVENGALI--

30:43.910 --> 30:46.946
- RIGHT.
WELL, THEN WHO STABBED ZOE?

30:46.979 --> 30:47.947
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.982
- ROLLINS, DID YOU CHECK
THE GIRLS' SOCIAL MEDIA?

30:50.016 --> 30:52.418
- YEAH, IN THEIR TEXTS, THEIR
EMAILS, THERE'S NO BOYFRIENDS,

30:52.451 --> 30:54.020
NOT EVEN REALLY
ANY OTHER FRIENDS.

30:54.053 --> 30:58.324
IT'S JUST A LOT OF BACK
AND FORTH BETWEEN PERRY AND MIA.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.126
THEY'RE IN THEIR OWN WORLD.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.599
- ZOE, CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY REASON

31:07.633 --> 31:11.503
THAT PERRY OR MIA
MIGHT WANT TO HURT YOU?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.905
- OF COURSE NOT.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.640
- LET'S LET ZOE ANSWER.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.950
- MAYBE PERRY?

31:23.983 --> 31:25.918
I MEAN, SHE'S THE ONE
WHO TOLD MIA

31:25.952 --> 31:29.388
ONLY BABIES SHARE THEIR ROOM
WITH THEIR BABY SISTER.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.327
- SO YOU SOMETIMES WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH THE BIG GIRLS,

31:35.361 --> 31:39.431
THEY--THEY NEVER HURT YOU
BEFORE, MAYBE BY ACCIDENT?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.002
- WELL, SOMETIMES...

31:43.035 --> 31:45.337
BY ACCIDENT.

31:45.371 --> 31:48.474
ONCE, PERRY AND MIA WERE HANGING
OUT IN PERRY'S ROOM.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.242
I WALKED IN WITHOUT KNOCKING.

31:50.276 --> 31:54.513
PERRY GOT MAD, RAN OUT,
AND PUSHED ME DOWN.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.182
MIA JUST STEPPED ON MY FOOT

31:56.215 --> 31:59.651
WHEN SHE RAN AFTER PERRY...

31:59.685 --> 32:03.122
BUT MIA WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.091
I MEAN,
I KNOW I ANNOY HER SOMETIMES,

32:05.124 --> 32:07.093
BUT WE'RE SISTERS.

32:23.509 --> 32:23.709
.

32:23.742 --> 32:24.910
- BREAKING NEWS--THE KNIFE THAT
WE FOUND INSIDE THE GATEHOUSE--

32:26.745 --> 32:28.480
ONLY ONE SET OF PRINTS...

32:28.514 --> 32:30.316
PERRY'S.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.185
- HER WOUNDS WERE ALL
ON ONE SIDE--NO DEFENSIVE MARKS.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.453
SHE STABBED HERSELF.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.088
- AFTER SHE TIED MIA UP.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.389
- YEAH, OKAY.
SO WHO STABBED ZOE?

32:37.423 --> 32:40.692
- HOLD ON. WE GOT THAT TOO.
HERE IT IS.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.728
DNA FROM ZOE ON THE BLADE
OF THE KNIFE

32:42.761 --> 32:44.730
FOUND IN CHARLIE'S CAMP.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.598
AH, THIS IS INTERESTING--

32:46.632 --> 32:50.269
ON THE HANDLE, TOUCH DNA
FROM CHARLIE AND GUESS WHO ELSE.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.538
PERRY AND MIA.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.342
- SO CHARLIE
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.210
HE PICKED UP THAT KNIFE
SAME AS HE DID THE CAMERA.

32:58.244 --> 33:01.180
- GO GIVE HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.416
BRING THOSE GIRLS BACK IN HERE
AND TELL THEIR MOTHERS WHY.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.384
- SHOULD WE CALL BARBARA TOO?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.719
- BOTH OF THE GIRLS
ARE UNDER 14 YEARS OLD.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.355
ZOE LIVED.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.358
THEY CAN'T BE TRIED AS ADULTS.

33:12.391 --> 33:15.361
I'LL CALL CORPORATION COUNCIL.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.663
- I TOLD YOU I WASN'T CRAZY.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.266
- OH, NO, YOU'RE BAT CRAZY,

33:20.299 --> 33:22.734
BUT YOU'RE NOT PARANOID.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.104
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE WOODS,

33:25.137 --> 33:27.306
BUT WE DO KNOW
YOU DIDN'T STAB THOSE TWO GIRLS.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.709
YOU DIDN'T TIE
THE OTHER ONE UP.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.445
- DID YOU FIND THAT
ON THE DEVICE?

33:33.479 --> 33:35.414
- NO. NO, CHARLIE.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.484
YOU WERE IN OUR CUSTODY
AT THAT POINT.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.386
YOU REALLY ARE
A GOOD SAMARITAN.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.588
YOU SAVED THAT GIRL ZOE.

33:44.590 --> 33:48.360
- SO--SO--SO I CAN--
I CAN LEAVE NOW?

33:48.394 --> 33:49.661
- YOU DID VIOLATE YOUR PAROLE.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.797
- DON'T--DON'T SEND ME BACK
TO ATTICA.

33:51.830 --> 33:55.434
- I WON'T, BUT YOU KNOW YOU
CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE WOODS,

33:55.467 --> 33:58.504
SO HOW ABOUT WE GET YOU
IN A PROGRAM...

33:58.537 --> 33:59.705
MAYBE WE GET YOU ON SOME MEDS?

33:59.738 --> 34:00.806
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT,

34:00.839 --> 34:05.411
BUT YOU JUST GOT TO TRUST ME
ON THIS, OKAY, CHARLIE?

34:05.444 --> 34:08.447
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.586
- FOR A WHILE, YEAH.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.388
- GOOD MAN.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.094
- SO YOU NEED TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED,

34:22.128 --> 34:25.497
BECAUSE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
IS YOU AND PERRY STABBED ZOE.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.698
- NO.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.401
NO, I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST GOING
TO LEAVE HER IN THE WOODS,

34:29.435 --> 34:30.469
JUST SCARE HER A LITTLE BIT.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.803
- THEN WHY DID YOU BRING
A KNIFE?

34:31.837 --> 34:34.373
- I DIDN'T BRING A KNIFE.
PERRY BROUGHT A KNIFE.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.308
SHE BROUGHT ONE
FOR HER AND ONE FOR ME.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.143
SHE SAID IT WAS FOR PROTECTION.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.844
- TELL THEM HOW PERRY
SCARED YOU.

34:38.877 --> 34:42.214
- THE DETECTIVES NEED TO KNOW
WHOSE IDEA THIS WHOLE THING WAS.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.815
- IT WAS ALL PERRY'S IDEA.

34:43.849 --> 34:47.186
WE WENT TO THE PARK,
AND THEN WE WENT DOWN THIS PATH,

34:47.219 --> 34:50.156
AND PERRY TRIPPED HER AND
HIT HER IN THE HEAD WITH A ROCK,

34:50.189 --> 34:53.225
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME
TO STAB MY SISTER.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.426
I DIDN'T DO IT.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.528
I DIDN'T DO IT. I SWEAR.
- OKAY.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.198
OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

34:59.231 --> 35:03.369
- SHE WENT CRAZY, STABBING ZOE,
AND I SHOUTED, "STOP," OKAY?

35:03.402 --> 35:05.771
THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.842
PERRY SAID THAT SHE WOULD KILL
ME IF I DIDN'T DO AS I WAS TOLD.

35:10.876 --> 35:11.943
- DO YOU SEE THIS?

35:11.977 --> 35:14.713
PERRY HAS MADE A VICTIM
OUT OF BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.748
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING OFF
ABOUT THAT GIRL.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.918
- WE UNDERSTAND.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.288
KEEP--KEEP GOING, MIA.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.525
- ZOE WAS LYING THERE,

35:26.558 --> 35:29.395
AND PERRY--SHE TOOK MY KNIFE
AND THE CAMERA,

35:29.428 --> 35:31.530
AND SHE THREW IT AWAY.

35:31.563 --> 35:35.434
SHE MADE ME COVER MY SISTER
WITH LEAVES.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.636
SHE HELD A KNIFE
TO MY THROAT, OKAY?

35:37.669 --> 35:39.938
SHE SAID THAT WE WERE GOING
TO GLASGOWMAN'S MANSION

35:39.971 --> 35:42.808
AND THAT I HAVE TO FORGET
ABOUT ZOE.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.877
HER EYES WERE BUGGY, AND SHE
LOOKED LIKE A MANIAC, OKAY?

35:45.911 --> 35:47.879
SHE'S CRAZY.

35:47.913 --> 35:51.383
I THOUGHT SHE WAS MY FRIEND,
BUT SHE'S CRAZY.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.319
[door opens]

35:53.352 --> 35:55.854
- MIA IS BLAMING YOU, PERRY.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.690
SHE SAID THAT STABBING ZOE
WAS YOUR IDEA.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.392
WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

36:00.426 --> 36:02.461
IS WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO HURT
YOUR FRIEND'S LITTLE SISTER?

36:02.494 --> 36:04.763
- IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.866
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

36:07.899 --> 36:10.469
- I WAS SIMPLY FOLLOWING ORDERS.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.704
- WHOSE ORDERS?
- GLASGOWMAN.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.606
HE COMES TO ME AT NIGHT.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.842
WE COMMUNICATE.

36:16.875 --> 36:20.412
HE STARED INTO MY EYES
AND TOLD ME MY MISSION.

36:20.446 --> 36:24.883
IF I FAILED, HE WAS GOING TO
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY AT MIDNIGHT.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.752
I HAD TO PROVE MY LOYALTY.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.787
- PERRY,
WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS?

36:28.820 --> 36:31.323
- LET HER TALK.

36:31.357 --> 36:35.294
- PERRY, HOW DID YOU PROVE
YOUR LOYALTY?

36:35.327 --> 36:38.330
- I HAD TO TAKE INNOCENT BLOOD.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.968
- OKAY.
WHOSE BLOOD?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.772
- ZOE.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.941
THAT'S HOW
YOU GET TO BE A PROXY.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.611
BUT WHEN ZOE
WAS LYING THERE...

36:52.644 --> 36:54.613
BLEEDING,

36:54.646 --> 36:58.484
I DIDN'T FEEL
GLASGOWMAN'S PRESENCE.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.018
I STARTED TO DOUBT.

37:00.051 --> 37:04.456
THAT'S WHY SHE SURVIVED.
HE MUST HAVE SWITCHED THE PLAN.

37:04.490 --> 37:08.427
- OKAY, SO WHAT DID
THE PLAN BECOME?

37:08.460 --> 37:11.463
- HE LED US TO THE GATEHOUSE...

37:11.497 --> 37:14.032
IN THE FORM OF A CAT,
BUT I MEAN, I KNEW IT WAS HIM

37:14.065 --> 37:17.436
BECAUSE HE HAD
GLASGOWMAN'S EYES,

37:17.469 --> 37:20.306
AND WHEN I LOOKED INTO THEM...

37:20.339 --> 37:22.574
HE TOLD ME TO MURDER MIA.

37:28.314 --> 37:31.617
- WELL, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.952
- THE CAT WAS GLARING
SO POWERFULLY,

37:33.985 --> 37:35.787
TRYING TO MAKE
THIS HYPNOTIC CONNECTION.

37:35.821 --> 37:36.955
I COULDN'T TAKE IT,

37:36.988 --> 37:38.624
SO I STABBED IT
THROUGH THE HEART

37:38.657 --> 37:42.494
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL MY FRIEND.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.297
GLASGOWMAN TRICKED ME.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.965
- I SWEAR THIS ISN'T
MY DAUGHTER.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.468
I'VE NEVER HEARD HER TALK
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.303
- CAN I HAVE A MOMENT
WITH MY CLIENT

37:51.337 --> 37:52.738
AND, UH, HER MOTHER?

37:59.478 --> 38:02.948
[door opens]

38:02.981 --> 38:05.484
- COUNSELOR,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:05.517 --> 38:07.686
- FIRST IMPRESSION--SHE'S
NOT COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

38:07.719 --> 38:08.987
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

38:09.020 --> 38:10.722
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF THIS BEHAVIOR

38:10.756 --> 38:12.658
BEFORE SHE KNEW
THAT WE WERE ONTO HER.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.894
- SHE TOOK TWO GIRLS
INTO THE WOODS, STABBED ONE,

38:15.927 --> 38:17.463
STABBED HERSELF, KILLED A CAT.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.030
I'D CALL AT LEAST ONE
OF THOSE A SIGN.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.532
- AND WE DON'T THINK
MIA IS INVOLVED?

38:20.566 --> 38:22.334
- NAH. I HAVE
AN EASIER TIME BELIEVING

38:22.368 --> 38:24.903
THAT SHE'S UNDER PERRY'S SPELL--
SHE'S SCARED TO DEATH--

38:24.936 --> 38:26.605
THAN BELIEVING THAT
SHE STABBED HER OWN SISTER

38:26.638 --> 38:28.474
AND LEFT HER FOR DEAD.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.575
- WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?

38:29.608 --> 38:31.743
- DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF
OF CONSPIRACY--

38:31.777 --> 38:34.413
EMAILS, TEXTS,
POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

38:34.446 --> 38:36.948
- NO.
NO, WE DON'T.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.352
- I'LL ORDER A PSYCH EVAL,
SEE WHERE WE ARE.

38:43.455 --> 38:47.959
- PERRY, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT GLASGOWMAN TRICKED YOU.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.129
CAN YOU TELL JUDGE LINDEN
HOW HE DID THAT?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.031
- HE SAID WE'D LIVE
IN HIS MANSION

38:53.064 --> 38:55.467
AND HAVE A TRUE LIFE,

38:55.501 --> 38:58.670
BUT HE GOT ANGRY
WHEN I WOULDN'T STAB MIA.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.573
I TIED HER UP,
BUT I-I WOULDN'T STAB HER.

39:01.607 --> 39:05.043
- AND THAT'S WHEN YOU
STABBED YOURSELF INSTEAD?

39:05.076 --> 39:06.678
- YES.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.647
I WAS OUTSIDE OF MY BODY.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.949
ONE PART OF ME WAS ARGUING
WITH THE OTHER PART,

39:10.982 --> 39:13.452
LIKE A DEVIL AND AN ANGEL.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.454
MY BODY GOT HOT.

39:15.487 --> 39:19.124
I COULD FEEL MY BLOOD SWIRLING
AND BOILING INSIDE ME,

39:19.157 --> 39:22.994
SO I STABBED MYSELF
TO LET THE BLOOD COOL OFF.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.000
- PERRY, THAT'S
A VERY INTERESTING STORY,

39:29.034 --> 39:31.136
BUT YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THAT STABBING ZOE

39:31.169 --> 39:32.838
WAS WRONG, DON'T YOU?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.940
- NO, THE POLICE WERE WRONG.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.509
SINCE THEY ENTERED
GLASGOWMAN'S REALM AND SAVED US,

39:37.543 --> 39:39.411
THE WORLD
IS AN UNBALANCED PLACE.

39:39.445 --> 39:41.413
- IS THAT A YES OR A NO?

39:41.447 --> 39:42.814
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

39:42.848 --> 39:44.650
GLASGOWMAN'S PARTNERS
FROM THE OTHER REALMS

39:44.683 --> 39:46.818
ARE GOING TO COME BACK
SEEKING VENGEANCE.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.019
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.755
- ALL RIGHT,
I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.491
THANK YOU, COUNSELOR COX.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.093
PERRY, YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.033
I AM READY TO MAKE MY RULING.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.703
WHILE I AM VERY TROUBLED
BY THE SERIOUSNESS

40:04.736 --> 40:07.973
OF THE INJURIES
SUSTAINED BY THE VICTIM,

40:08.006 --> 40:10.976
THE MANDATE OF FAMILY COURT
IS TO BE THERAPEUTIC,

40:11.009 --> 40:13.579
NOT PUNITIVE.

40:13.612 --> 40:17.916
MIA HARRIS, PLEASE RISE.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.487
IT SEEMS TO ME, BASED ON YOUR
AND ZOE'S TESTIMONY,

40:21.520 --> 40:24.823
THAT YOU WERE ALSO A VICTIM
IN THIS MATTER.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.526
I THEREFORE DECLARE YOU
NOT RESPONSIBLE

40:27.559 --> 40:30.028
AND RELEASE YOU
TO YOUR PARENTS' CARE.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.997
HOWEVER...

40:32.030 --> 40:36.101
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU
RECEIVE WEEKLY PSYCHIATRIC CARE.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.770
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT
FOR ZOE AS WELL.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.139
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

40:41.172 --> 40:44.643
- PERRY GILBERT...

40:44.676 --> 40:46.978
I ADJUDICATE YOU
AS A JUVENILE DELINQUENT

40:47.012 --> 40:50.115
ON THE UNDERLYING CHARGE
OF ASSAULT ONE,

40:50.148 --> 40:54.820
BUT BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY
AND THE PSYCHIATRIC REPORT,

40:54.853 --> 40:56.788
IN LIEU OF JUVENILE DETENTION,

40:56.822 --> 41:00.826
I AM REMANDING YOU
TO CREEDMORE PSYCHIATRIC CENTER.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.261
YOU WILL REMAIN THERE
UNTIL YOU ARE DETERMINED

41:03.294 --> 41:07.499
TO NO LONGER BE A DANGER
TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS.

41:07.533 --> 41:11.737
I HOPE YOU GET THE HELP
YOU NEED.

41:11.770 --> 41:12.904
WE ARE ADJOURNED.

41:12.938 --> 41:13.939
[gavel bangs]

41:20.011 --> 41:21.246
- GREAT.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.981
MIA'S GONNA WALK,
AND PERRY GETS SOFT TIME.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.583
- ALEX, JUSTICE WAS SERVED,
ALL RIGHT?

41:24.616 --> 41:25.917
PERRY'S LOONEY TUNES,

41:25.951 --> 41:28.219
AND MIA AND ZOE--
THEY'D NEVER HURT EACH OTHER.

41:28.253 --> 41:31.256
- IF YOU SAY SO.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.597
- HOLD THE DOOR.
