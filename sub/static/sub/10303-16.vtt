01:16.200 --> 01:19.272
Okay, Kel, let's go over the plan
just one more time, all right?

01:19.520 --> 01:23.195
Now, you can't go to Wanker County
with Mom and Dad because...?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.510
I have to do a commercial
for traffic safety.

01:25.760 --> 01:30.550
That's right. And I can't go to Wanker
County with Mom and Dad because...?

01:30.800 --> 01:33.678
A rubber sheep is demanding you
take a blood test?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.275
Fine. No, fine. Fine.
We'll go to Wanker County.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.789
Don't come to me when they ask
why you're single...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.639
...when you have
a perfectly good brother.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.759
Come on, Bud, I was just kidding.
I can do this.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.310
Daddy might have been able to break
me when the police brought me home...

01:51.520 --> 01:54.512
...at 2 in the morning,
but I am not 11 anymore.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.555
Okay, there's the Dodge
early-warning system. Let's go.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.237
- Now, remember the plan.
- Gotcha. What plan?

02:06.480 --> 02:08.515
Just kidding.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.473
Al, why are you in such a bad mood?

02:24.720 --> 02:27.234
Some men like going shopping
with their wives.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.072
Sure, for coffins.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.954
I hate buying stuff
for the Wanker folk, Peg.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.509
Well, they like stuff from the big city.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.398
We just have things they can't get.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.790
Let's make sure we got it all.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.197
Wax.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.798
String.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.190
Things that go click.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.758
And to think, they bestowed
their highest honor on you.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.228
Well, that's understandable.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.233
I'm the only person they ever saw
who doesn't have a shell.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.148
Scoff all you want.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.470
But I think being named
the grand marshal...

03:01.720 --> 03:05.030
...of the Wanker County
Bicentennial Parade is a big deal.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.999
Yeah, Dad. Come on,
they're celebrating 200 years.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.233
Since what?
They crawled from the oceans?

03:12.600 --> 03:15.797
No way was it that long ago.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.554
Two hundred years ago,
it was bought from the Indians.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.553
Not the legend
of Wanker County again.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.918
Wanker County was originally
called Obi Luba Possa Wadamy.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.869
Which means,
Land of the Big Gassy Possum.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.952
Which explains why Disney has no
interest in putting a theme park there.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.349
Look, I for one
am very excited to be going.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.359
I said, I for one am very excited
to be going to Wanker County...

03:51.600 --> 03:53.795
...with my sister.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.675
Come in.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.429
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.150
I've got something I have to tell you.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.075
I'm afraid that Bud and I won't be able
to go to Wanker County.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.597
You see, I just got a commercial
for traffic safety.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.911
And Bud, since he works for
the Department of Vehicle Services...

04:18.160 --> 04:20.196
...is going to consult.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.232
The end.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.119
Well, bye.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.679
Hold it.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.598
Pumpkin.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.710
I want you to look Daddy in the eye.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.957
Okay, it was a lie.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.952
But it was all Bud's idea.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.390
That's right.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.518
I wanted to go to Wanker County.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.151
And not only that, last Tuesday
Bud drank milk right from the carton.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.552
And when he was 11,
he smoked a cigarette.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.554
When I think of the pain...

05:06.800 --> 05:11.157
...and the suffering that I went through
for you to be conceived...

05:15.280 --> 05:19.910
You should be ashamed of yourself
for deceiving your family this way.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.668
Al.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.477
The home office just ordered us to
have a 24-hour emergency shoe sale.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.233
The fat women have landed.
You gotta come.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.876
Dash it all.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.711
I was going to Wanker County.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.351
- I'm sorry, Peg.
- Just a second.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.477
Griff.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.950
Look me in the eye.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.153
There really is no shoe sale.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.110
It was all Bud's idea.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.356
And he dialed some 976 numbers
from the shoe store.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.149
And he took a handful
of cerebral-palsy mints without paying.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.035
And you know what he did
when he was 11, right?

06:23.280 --> 06:25.191
Goodbye, Griff.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.116
- See you when you get back, Al?
- Oh, you can count on it, buddy.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.879
Now, aren't you three ashamed
of yourselves?

06:43.120 --> 06:47.079
You mean in general, or because
of this Wanker County hooey?

06:47.320 --> 06:50.073
We are all going and that's final.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.920
It's not gonna work, Buck.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.394
<i>It was all Bud's idea.</i>

07:03.880 --> 07:08.032
Now, like I was saying, we're all
gonna go and we're all gonna have fun.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.793
- Right?
- Right, Mom.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.917
No.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.355
Okay. Now, let's stop at the car wash.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.788
Car wash? What for?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.991
So the Dodge will look nice
in the parade.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.553
How nice do we have to look?

07:19.800 --> 07:23.349
This year's theme is thumbs.
Show them if you got them.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.075
You know, Peg, I hate car washes.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.835
That Dodge is a finely tuned
precision instrument...

07:35.080 --> 07:38.152
...and I don't want some stranger's
rough hands all over it.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.753
Sir, we need the keys.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.871
Now, you keep your hands
off my CD player.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.712
Al, we don't have a CD player.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.554
We would have, Peg,
if you hadn't have said that.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.432
Would you just calm down?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.238
This is supposed to be fun.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.118
Let's buy a car air freshener.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.715
Do they have a scent
called "New Wife"?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.909
Peg, your trouble
is you spend money in a frivolous--

08:11.120 --> 08:12.951
Oh, a racing stripe.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.996
The Dodge does not need
a racing stripe.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.789
It couldn't hit 60
if you dropped it out of a plane.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.635
No, but you could, Peg.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.078
Oh, Peg, look. Car bras.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.837
The Dodge does not need a car bra.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.355
Well, it's not for the Dodge, Peg.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.755
No, it's for your mom.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.837
See, it's even in her size.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.758
Astrovan.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.234
You know something, Kel?

08:50.480 --> 08:51.959
I always wondered...

08:52.200 --> 08:56.432
...you think hot carnauba wax really
comes out when the light goes on?

08:56.680 --> 09:01.276
Bud, maybe you should save those
mind-bending insights for a date...

09:02.160 --> 09:04.833
...or perhaps a willing rubber ear.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.910
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot the only
talking that goes on on your dates is:

09:09.120 --> 09:11.270
"Keep the line moving."

09:14.120 --> 09:15.348
Look at this place.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.670
What kind of loser
works at a car wash?

09:27.640 --> 09:30.871
Marcie, I don't wanna work
in a car wash.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.635
Look, I am tired of coming home
after a hard day's work...

09:34.880 --> 09:38.350
<i>...and hearing you say, "Honey,
guess who was on Oprah today."</i>

09:38.600 --> 09:41.239
It's like being married to Peggy.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.432
Come on, this is the most
embarrassing thing in the world.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.513
There is nothing wrong
with an honest day's pay.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.389
Besides, who is gonna see you?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.435
Oh, my God! It's the ex!

10:14.680 --> 10:16.671
Quick. Hide.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.359
- Steve.
- Marcie.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.637
- Steve.
- Marcie.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.597
So, what brings you to the car wash?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.556
Well, my car was dirty and they do
such a lousy job of cleaning it...

10:37.760 --> 10:40.672
...down at the batting cages,
I thought I'd bring it here.

10:41.680 --> 10:46.071
Well, it's nice to see you're
still such a sarcastic twit, Steve.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.710
Besides, I thought you were
in the desert protecting the wildlife...

10:49.960 --> 10:53.430
<i>...and performing Guys and Dolls
with your little cactus friends.</i>

10:54.240 --> 10:57.710
That, much like our marriage,
was just a phase.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.116
I did the environmental thing, and then
decided I wanted to find myself.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.512
And what I found
was myself likes money.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.151
So did Mr. Marcie let you out alone?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.991
Have you been here long?

11:20.480 --> 11:25.270
I guess for a little while. It takes a long
time to detail a Lincoln Town Car.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.310
You're driving a Town Car?

11:31.960 --> 11:33.837
I live in town.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.752
So...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.309
...where is the new, unimproved,
unemployed me?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.755
At home watching Richard Bey?

11:42.400 --> 11:46.075
If it's Jefferson you're referring to,
I'll have you know he's...

11:46.320 --> 11:48.276
...at the office.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.795
You know, where he's busy
working on his--

11:51.040 --> 11:53.474
- Tan?
- Career.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.951
- So, what'd you get, Al?
- Nothing.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.509
I saw you over there
by the audio cassettes.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.955
- What'd you get?
- Nothing.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.632
<i>"Ned Beatty Sings The Blues"?</i>

12:10.320 --> 12:12.117
He's got a right.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.870
I'm gonna put this back.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.391
Now, let's get the car.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.676
They better not have screwed up
my Dodge, Peg.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.674
They are not gonna screw up
the Dodge, Al. They're professionals.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.276
Mr. Bundy, I don't know
how to tell you this...

12:27.520 --> 12:29.590
...but we can't find your car.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.351
What do you mean
you can't find my car?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.397
I saw it go in.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.233
Me too. But it never came out.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.749
That'll be 8.95, please.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.957
Hi, I'm Mikey. I'm the manager.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.994
Of what, the Mets?

13:03.240 --> 13:05.310
I don't take lip from shoe salesmen.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.836
What do you want?
I have a book report due tomorrow.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.279
Well, I want my car.
It never came out the other end.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.119
Are you sure you brought a car?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.716
No, I drove the wife.

13:19.880 --> 13:23.190
Of course I brought a car,
you zit farm.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.352
Hey, Daddy.
I'm afraid I got some more bad news.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.477
I thought I'd check
the lost and found.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.636
Oh, this ought to be good.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.355
There were no Dodges.
There was a nice Plymouth, though.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.397
Oh, Al.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.792
I don't want a Plymouth, Peg.
I want my Dodge, dagnab it.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.190
"Dagnab it"?

13:46.520 --> 13:50.069
<i>What'd you do, get the Hooked on
Phonics: Yosemite Sam tape?</i>

13:51.120 --> 13:54.112
This is ridiculous.
How can our car just disappear?

13:54.320 --> 13:58.108
Well, Siegfried and Roy
make that tiger disappear.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.954
Well, we all know where that goes.

14:02.480 --> 14:07.110
Look, Bundy, we don't want you
to go away a dissatisfied customer.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.477
So here's a card
good for one free car wash.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.958
Now, this is ridiculous.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.713
I'm gonna retrace my steps.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.873
Somewhere in this car wash
is a Dodge with my name on it.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.633
Gee, I didn't know
they made a Dodge Loser.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.158
Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.318
Let's have Buck go search for it.
He's a dog.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.437
Oh, come on, he's 100.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.714
He misses
when he tries to lick himself.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.389
Oh, so do you.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.677
But a dog never loses
his sense of smell.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.832
Go find the Dodge, mighty Buck.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.032
Go.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.111
Go.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.713
What's he doing?

14:55.560 --> 14:57.232
He's going.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.789
Maybe I should have said "leave."

15:07.040 --> 15:09.156
<i>I still would've gone.</i>

15:10.600 --> 15:14.912
I say, there's got to be
a logical explanation for this.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.953
Hey, maybe somebody stole it.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.397
We would have seen somebody
driving off in our car.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.391
It's not like we're not observant.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.993
I mean, there are four of us.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.754
One of us would have had
to see something.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.713
Well, if that car is still here,
it's not gonna get past me.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.350
Yeah. Let's just keep our eyes peeled.
Come on.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.511
I know what you're doing, you know.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.593
Sitting there like some soulless,
money-grubbing snob...

16:01.840 --> 16:04.070
...because you know it turns me on.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.832
Well, it's not going to work.

16:07.080 --> 16:11.358
I already have a man and
he's even more materialistic than you.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.432
And how much
of that material is yours?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.348
Are you implying
that I support Jefferson...

16:19.600 --> 16:21.830
...and that he's never earned
a penny in his life?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.031
Because you don't know
the half of it--

16:24.280 --> 16:26.475
Are those Gucci loafers?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.998
Yes. They do look smashing on me,
don't they?

16:30.240 --> 16:33.550
Well, they do distract
from the rest of you.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.879
Same old Marcie.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.031
Flat and to the point.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.589
For being in the women's restroom,
we're gonna dock you a week's pay.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.236
Well, there goes that yacht
I was gonna buy.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.714
You're already on thin ice...

16:51.920 --> 16:55.356
...Mr. Ivy-League-Pervert-in-the
Bathroom-Looking-Up-Women's-Skirts.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.551
I don't want any more
shenanigans out of you.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.593
I want you buffing the next thing
that comes out of here.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.040
Al, what are you doing here?

17:16.280 --> 17:20.751
I was on my way to Wanker, thought
I'd stop and walk through the car wash.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.030
- Wasn't the wax hot?
- Yes.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.795
But that's the price you pay
if you wanna wear a bikini.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.516
Do you mind?

17:34.720 --> 17:35.948
Very nice, Al.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.191
You are here
dilly-dallying with Jefferson...

17:38.400 --> 17:40.038
...and we're looking for the car.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.508
Peg, what is it with you?

17:41.720 --> 17:43.756
You can change six D batteries
in the dark...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.595
...but you can't find a 2-ton
automobile in broad daylight.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.150
Let's not start talking about
who can't find what in the dark.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.238
All right, all right!
Here's what we'll do.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.232
We'll split up.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.588
Then what?

18:04.840 --> 18:06.956
That's it. Just split up.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.240
I should've thought of this
years ago.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.913
Dad, what about the car?

18:12.160 --> 18:14.913
Look, I say we each take
a different path and circle the lot.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.515
- I mean, the Dodge has gotta be here.
- Bud's right.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.753
But when we find it,
we still get to split up, don't we?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.831
Well, Marcie,
I see the Town Car is ready.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.559
Anyway...

18:27.760 --> 18:31.070
...I'm sorry I didn't get to see that busy
executive husband of yours.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.589
That's right. He is busy.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.671
Doing what an executive does.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.516
Interfacing, networking,
making multi-million-dollar decisions.

18:40.760 --> 18:44.196
Hey, Willy, towel or sponge
on the hubcaps?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.037
I see he's in the middle
of a power wash.

18:49.680 --> 18:54.231
Okay, so maybe he's not
on the Forbes 400, or 4000...

18:54.480 --> 18:57.995
...or maybe he wouldn't even be
a rich man in Peru...

18:58.240 --> 19:00.708
...but he's got something
you will never have.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.837
A Windex holster?

19:04.280 --> 19:05.508
Class.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.473
Which, I might add, money can't buy.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.750
Jefferson doesn't need
to make a lot of money.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.992
I'm happy with him
just the way he is.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.554
Marcie, I got soap in my eye.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.069
Shut up. Let's go.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.675
- I thought you wanted me to work.
- I do.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.595
It's just that I have another position
in mind for you.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.197
Maybe two.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.593
Here, you dropped your hat.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.116
- Come on, get in the car, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.353
Hey, hey, hey.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.518
- Aren't those my shoes?
- Yes, sir.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.352
I had them polished for you.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.429
You know, I can't believe it.
It's gone.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.511
The Dodge is really gone.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.433
Maybe the earth opened up
and swallowed it.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.797
No. Then it would have
spit it back up.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.754
You know,
it's not so much the Dodge...

20:19.000 --> 20:20.752
...as what was inside it.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.718
What was in it?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.188
Stuff.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.112
<i>- Big 'Uns?
- I'm not saying.</i>

20:26.360 --> 20:28.749
Bundy, I just got off the phone
with the owner.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.150
He wants to do something
to make this up to you.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.237
- What?
- We're gonna buy you another car.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.271
- I don't want another car!
- Shut up, Al.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.512
- But, Peg, there's still stuff in that car.
- Shut up.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.994
How does a new Hyundai sound?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.475
Like an old lawn mower.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.119
I want my car!

20:44.360 --> 20:46.555
Would you shut up
and just take the car before--?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.633
- Mr. Bundy, we found your car.
- Of course.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.233
- Where was it?
- On the lot.

20:51.480 --> 20:55.109
Yeah, when we washed all the dirt off,
we found it was a different color.

20:57.560 --> 21:02.714
Gee, Al, maybe if we got you to take
a shower, we'd find out you were black.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.636
But then again...

21:06.960 --> 21:08.951
- Hey, what color was it?
- Red.

21:09.200 --> 21:14.149
Hey, come to think of it,
I remember buying a red Dodge.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.271
Look at her, family,
isn't she a beaut?

21:23.120 --> 21:26.715
Look at him, family,
isn't he a shoe salesman? Let's go.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.235
Wait. I gotta check
and see if my stuff's in here.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.948
<i>- What stuff?
- Oh, you know. Big 'Uns.</i>

21:32.200 --> 21:34.395
<i>It's not Big 'Uns, Peg.</i>

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
