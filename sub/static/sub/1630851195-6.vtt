WEBVTT

02:18.347 --> 02:21.183
I think the real question
is one of identity.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.478
What is the identity
of the Democratic Party?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.855
It's not normally something
that you get to choose,

02:26.939 --> 02:30.817
but that's exactly what's gonna happen
here tomorrow at the Nevada caucus.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.110
A lot at stake there.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.612
Thanks, Carl. Thanks, Bradley.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.573
Hey, Bradley.
Great job moderating, by the way.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.658
Thank you.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.825
She did do a great job.

02:39.618 --> 02:44.039
And, Daniel,
someone's got a new job, don't they?

02:44.122 --> 02:45.582
That's right, Alison.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.835
He's made us laugh at nighttime
on Better Late,

02:47.918 --> 02:50.504
but when UBA+ launches March 13th,

02:50.587 --> 02:53.423
we'll be able to stream him at any time

02:53.507 --> 02:57.594
on a brand-new show
called Exact Change with Peter Bullard.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.929
Look, Earl.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.140
I've held this Hannah Shoenfeld story
as long as I'm gonna hold it.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.060
I told you,
I've got a better story for you.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.897
Two major female celebrities
in a secret same-sex relationship.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.775
Those kinds of stories
don't have legs like they used to.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.987
I can assure you,
this story's gonna be a big win for you.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.655
These are big names.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.491
Since when can't The Vault,
America's number one tabloid,

03:19.575 --> 03:20.909
use a story like this?

03:20.993 --> 03:22.786
Times haven't changed that much.

03:22.870 --> 03:27.040
I'm going to need solid proof.
Photographic evidence.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.209
We don't have photos.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.171
I am not going to get
a story of this magnitude wrong.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.548
I'm not opening myself up
to another lawsuit.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.884
Al, you'll be good.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.762
Bottom line, Earl.
Can you get me pictures or not?

03:44.850 --> 03:46.476
I can tell you where to find them.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.355
Deal. So, who is it?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.194
What is Exact Change with Peter Bullard?

03:55.277 --> 03:58.197
Well, I'll be honest with you.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.701
I get a little tired of doing these little
five-minute interviews with celebrities.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.538
You know, I wanted to talk to people
that are making a difference in the world.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.917
Not just, you know,
making Transformers 12.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.794
So that's what Exact Change is.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.547
It's long-form interviews one-on-one

04:15.631 --> 04:18.091
with people who are making
a positive change.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.720
You know, it's kinda funny
to hear you say that

04:21.803 --> 04:24.389
because you're known for your irreverence.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.849
What a disgusting word.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.269
No, sure I'm known as a TV stooge.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.688
But even I can evolve.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.442
You know, with all that's gone on
the last couple of years, how could I not?

04:36.443 --> 04:39.863
Wow, wow. Peter Bullard. Evolved.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.698
I-- Yeah. It makes me sick too.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.619
'Cause I remember when you referred to me
as "mincing" on your show.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.371
I--

04:47.454 --> 04:50.165
-You know, I don't think I--
-Do you think I'm mincing?

04:50.249 --> 04:51.375
'Cause I don't.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.419
-That's not a word I'd use to describe me.
-Daniel, don't.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.006
Well, I don't think I did.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.091
No, you definitely did.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.178
Daniel.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.263
Very funny.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.349
Well, you have some really great guests.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.560
-Who should we be looking for?
-Yeah.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.646
Yeah, well, we have Greta Thunberg.
She's gonna be on the show.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.906
Hey, welcome back. How was Las Vegas?

05:23.407 --> 05:25.617
Didn't you hear? It was triumphant.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.414
And thanks, of course, to Mr. Curt Savage,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.416
who's done such a great job
filling in for Yanko.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.168
Thank you, Curt. Really great job.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.295
-Thank you. Thanks, all.
-We appreciate you.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.840
And now that we've all had
a moment to breathe,

05:39.923 --> 05:41.925
a proper round of applause
for all of our team

05:42.009 --> 05:45.262
that did such great work
on the debate and caucus coverage.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.014
Really, everybody.

05:49.308 --> 05:53.103
But especially Miss Bradley Jackson.
Give it up, everybody, 'cause...

05:53.687 --> 05:54.730
Thank you.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.357
Thank you.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.442
Thank you.

05:59.151 --> 06:03.322
'Cause she set such a high bar for herself
with those last-minute heroics.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.406
She killed it.

06:04.489 --> 06:09.244
So, imagine what she'll be able to do
given three weeks to prepare

06:09.328 --> 06:12.789
-to moderate the Phoenix debate.
-What?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.499
-Yeah.
-Speech!

06:14.583 --> 06:15.751
-Speech!
-Yeah!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.836
-Give it up!
-Speech! Speech!

06:17.920 --> 06:20.422
-Speech! Little speech!
-No, I'm not giving a speech.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.342
But I have to give credit
where credit is due.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.969
Chip, thank you so much
for cramming with me.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.804
I could not have done this without you.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.056
You cram with the best of 'em

06:29.139 --> 06:32.017
and you'll be cramming it
for a long time to come.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.436
So, little round of applause for Chip.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.859
And I'm just glad
to be able to fill in for Alex.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.361
I hope she feels better soon.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.822
Hear! Hear!
What's the latest from Camp Levy?

06:45.906 --> 06:46.990
Isabella? Chip?

06:47.533 --> 06:49.451
Yeah. I stopped by her place last night.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.078
She's feeling a little better.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.623
-Chip. Any word on when Alex will be back?
-Turn it up.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.501
Catch Audra Khatri's
interview with Maggie Brener…

06:57.584 --> 07:01.046
I stopped by her place last night as well.
Hard to tell at the moment, but…

07:01.129 --> 07:03.757
…where they discuss her tell-all book
The Wrong Side of the Bed,

07:03.841 --> 07:06.510
her exposé on The Morning Show
and UBA's history of sexual misconduct…

07:06.593 --> 07:07.803
Ballpark?

07:07.886 --> 07:10.222
-…cover-ups and toxic culture.
-She needs her rest, you know.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.807
Soon, I hope.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.642
This Friday, on YDA.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.520
I don't want her to come back
before she's ready.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.606
I mean, her health is way more important
than this show.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.526
No question.
But we did promise the world Alex Levy,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.237
so do you have a sense of when it'll be?

07:26.363 --> 07:31.243
Well, it would strictly be a guess.
The back is unpredictable.

07:31.326 --> 07:34.371
We don't need a guess.
What does the doctor think?

07:35.038 --> 07:39.293
The doctor thinks that she's lucky
she doesn't seem to need surgery.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.003
But we're gonna have to wait and see.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.589
You've done my job, Chip.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.883
Do you think what you said
is any help for me

07:45.966 --> 07:47.968
figuring out how to produce
this fucking show?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.762
What does Alex say?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.056
Alex says soon.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.642
She's doing her best,
but she's in a lot of pain,

07:55.726 --> 07:59.855
so I haven't pressed her on it.
She is as upset about this as anyone is.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.023
What's up, Cory?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.275
Well, I just got off the phone
with Peter Bullard.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.361
He was not happy
with Daniel's line of questioning.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.281
I know. He called me too.
I'm dealing with it.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.201
Well, now he called me.
So, I have to make sure it's done right.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.661
It's Peter Bullard.
It's what he does. He pokes at everything.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.914
I mean, I think Daniel thought
he was sparring with him.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.041
But why?
Why would he be sparring with him?

08:19.124 --> 08:22.586
He's promoting our streaming service and
telling Peter Bullard he's full of shit.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.505
-That's not sparring.
-That's not what Daniel said.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.590
That's what Peter heard.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.302
Okay, but Peter Bullard is kinda
full of shit right now, isn't he though?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.638
Peter Bullard, he's making us money.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.597
He's allowed to be full of shit.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.265
That's the rule.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.647
And Daniel, he pissed him off.
So, how long before Alex is back?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.732
Yeah, we were just about to find that out.

08:44.232 --> 08:49.571
And I was just saying that Alex is
as upset about this as anyone.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.115
And I can certainly tell her

08:52.199 --> 08:55.911
that you're pushing for a return date,
see how that goes.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.079
Yeah, that's fine.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.664
You can tell her.

08:58.747 --> 09:03.043
She knows we just brought her back.
She knows that this makes us look stupid.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.587
We need to find somebody big,
somebody stunty

09:05.671 --> 09:07.589
to fill in until Alex gets back.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.882
Somebody even bigger than Alex,

09:08.966 --> 09:11.218
and somebody who you'd never expect
to do it forever.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.803
So, let's think now.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.724
Well, I was gonna say Bullard,
but that idea is out the window, so…

09:27.359 --> 09:28.610
What about Laura Peterson?

09:32.114 --> 09:34.032
-Yes. Let's do that.
-No.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.994
I don't think Alex is
gonna be thrilled about that.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.289
I know. But she gets that, as EP,
you have to make hard decisions,

09:40.372 --> 09:44.001
and think of it as a motivator, you know.
Help speed her recovery.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.294
That's smart.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.255
Okay. Laura's great,
but I don't see her doing this.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.590
So I'll put together a list.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.383
Oh, no. Let's call, get an answer now.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.010
She's a friend. It's an easy ask.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.938
Oh, my God. Put it on speaker.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.486
-Hi, Cory.
-Laura. So glad I got you.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.280
-I've got a favor to ask.
-I'm scared.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.200
No need to be scared.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.620
Would you fill in for Alex
until her back heals?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.788
-Yes. Yes.
-Come on, Cory.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.999
The hours aren't great.
There's nothing I can do about that.

10:24.082 --> 10:28.504
But there's no heavy lifting.
You just come in. You be you on TV.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.465
You seem to be enjoying Bradley.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.009
I think you two'd be really good together.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.178
I'll let you hit me.

10:36.678 --> 10:37.763
Hard.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.723
Anywhere but the face.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.893
All other options are on the table.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.187
Who needs money
when you get a free kick to the balls?

10:46.772 --> 10:47.856
Priceless.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.191
Please.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.151
Sure. What the hell.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.319
God.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.279
You are seriously the best.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.366
I wish I had more time to promote this.
This is actually huge, huge news.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.576
Laura Peterson is coming back
to the mornings.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.079
I'm so excited. All right.
I'll have Mia reach out. Thank you.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.958
See? Simple.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.462
-Oh, my God. I'm so excited.
-Oh, my God.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.756
-Wait. Where you going?
-To the studio.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.133
You wanted me to do the show.
I'm not gonna half-ass it.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.468
Yes. Absolutely.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.847
We definitely need your whole ass
on the show.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.142
Hey. Since we both have to wake up
at the ass crack of dawn,

11:24.226 --> 11:25.602
maybe I could just sleep over.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.646
I could just go home and get some things.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.398
I'd be amenable to that.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.482
Great.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.234
Hey.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.612
Look, if you wanna leave some stuff here,
I've got plenty of closet space.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.823
There's no reason for you
to be running back and forth.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.119
Okay. Yeah.
I'll just be back in a couple hours.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.287
Okay.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.250
It doesn't seem like Alex
is gonna be back by then,

11:48.333 --> 11:51.211
so it's up to President Carter
if he wants to reschedule.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.838
If you can let him know

11:52.921 --> 11:55.340
that Laura Peterson is
gonna be filling in for her, I--

11:56.675 --> 11:58.510
Yeah, we love her too. So--

11:59.094 --> 12:01.305
And I will let her know that.

12:03.599 --> 12:04.933
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
Okay. Bye.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.148
Fuck.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.066
Damn it.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.655
Leave a message after the tone.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.824
Hey, Ken, it's Mia.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.828
So sorry we keep missing each other,
but I think you know why I've called.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.539
This excerpt is coming out
in a couple days,

12:27.623 --> 12:31.793
and I get that you don't want it leaking,
but I need to know what I'm dealing with.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.549
I don't think Maggie hung me out.
But you know. Who knows?

12:38.675 --> 12:41.220
Anyway, it's just for me.

12:42.346 --> 12:46.016
So listen, I'm around. Thanks.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.450
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.000
Hal?

13:13.252 --> 13:14.253
Hal.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.339
-Hal, what are you doing here?
-Hey.

13:18.549 --> 13:21.051
-Surprising you.
-Yeah, no shit.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.346
You been up here a whole year.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.431
You come home for one night
and then fly back out?

13:26.515 --> 13:29.935
Oh, my God. Save the guilt trip
for inside, please. Come on.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.770
-It's not a guilt trip.
-It is a guilt trip.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.064
You're trying to make me feel bad
for having a life.

13:34.565 --> 13:37.651
I missed you. I wanted to see you.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.988
God. Can't your little brother get a hug?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.533
Yes. I missed you too.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.538
How long are you staying?

13:49.621 --> 13:51.456
'Cause I could get you a room of your own.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.083
No. I came to see you.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.294
I'll just-- I'll sleep on the couch.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.296
As long as Mom is not here, I'm happy.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.464
Is everything okay?

14:00.132 --> 14:01.508
Stupid question.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.512
You wanna get something to eat?

14:05.596 --> 14:08.974
Your treat.
I mean, unless you have plans tonight.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.060
Nope. No plans.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.731
Why you making me feel guilty?
You don't even have a life.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.316
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.276
I'm looking up options
of things you might like.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.819
Something I might like?

14:20.903 --> 14:23.614
Look, I mean, come on.
There's gotta be a Cracker Barrel,

14:23.697 --> 14:25.782
or a Waffle House within walking distance.

14:25.866 --> 14:30.662
Come on. Look, put that away.
Look, we're in New York, all right?

14:30.746 --> 14:32.581
We're gonna get wild, okay?

14:32.664 --> 14:36.710
The sixth restaurant we pass,
that's where we're gonna eat. All right?

14:37.294 --> 14:39.004
Okay. Sounds like a plan.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.631
Come on. Let's get crazy.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.382
Or food poisoning.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.760
Senator Sanders
is coming off a big weekend

14:44.843 --> 14:47.304
winning the Nevada Democratic caucus
decisively

14:47.387 --> 14:48.931
before moving on to a big enthusiastic--

14:49.014 --> 14:50.682
Harvey Weinstein guilty of third degree--

14:51.475 --> 14:53.977
Overseas, the virus continues to spread,

14:54.061 --> 14:56.730
with confirmed coronavirus cases
climbing into the hundreds over the--

14:57.689 --> 15:00.317
The Dow dropped
more than a thousand points today.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.570
Analysts are calling this
the worst day they've seen in years

15:03.654 --> 15:04.821
and are attributing the down--

15:04.905 --> 15:08.116
Start your day with Laura Peterson…

15:23.215 --> 15:24.216
Oh, Chuck.

15:24.883 --> 15:29.054
This is sad. This is really sad.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.182
No, don't move. It is quite the tableau.

15:32.683 --> 15:36.061
I swear the TV was just on
before you came in here.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.982
Yeah, you're not buying it.
All right, turn the light on.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.066
Good idea.

15:44.278 --> 15:50.158
Well, Laura Peterson on TMS.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.953
Hell has frozen over, but I'm excited.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.831
Will miracles never cease?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.333
Hey, how is Alex?

15:58.917 --> 16:03.172
I mean, you know,
her back is giving her some problems,

16:03.255 --> 16:04.882
but it'll be okay.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.801
I know she wasn't doing too well
the night before the debate.

16:07.885 --> 16:11.013
I just wanted to make sure she was okay.
Maggie was concerned.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.309
Maggie was concerned?

16:15.392 --> 16:18.604
Yeah, she said Alex was in quite a state
when she came to her hotel room.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.773
Yes. Well…

16:23.400 --> 16:26.570
she was clearly not at her best
that night. You know?

16:26.653 --> 16:30.824
And I think what happened is
her doctor gave her these pain pills,

16:30.908 --> 16:34.077
but then she had muscle relaxants too,
so that--

16:34.161 --> 16:35.412
Geez. Yeah.

16:35.495 --> 16:40.959
So hopefully Alex didn't say anything
too off the wall, you know?

16:41.043 --> 16:43.754
I mean, she couldn't even remember
what she said, so.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.799
Did Maggie--
Did she tell you what she said, or…

16:47.883 --> 16:50.636
No, no. No,
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.720
You know Maggie.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.932
She's not just gonna spread
someone's private business around.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.016
She was just worried.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.226
Yeah, of course.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.728
Unless someone paid her a huge advance

16:59.811 --> 17:02.022
to publish someone's private business
in hardcover.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.233
Touché. Score one for Chuck.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.569
Well, look,
I do really appreciate you checking in.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.446
Honestly, it means a lot.
So thanks for that.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.698
But I think she's good.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.160
I gotta make some calls.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.079
Yeah, I was just heading out.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.579
I will see you in…

17:19.623 --> 17:20.999
oh, God, eight hours.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.960
-That's morning TV.
-All right.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.087
-Night, Chuck.
-Good night.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.512
Oh, shit.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.527
Hey, Alex, are you there?

17:49.695 --> 17:53.532
I mean, I know you're there,
but would you please pick up?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.035
I have a feeling
you don't check these voice mails,

17:57.119 --> 18:01.999
but I know this thing plays out loud,
so… olly olly oxen free.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.501
I don't know.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.587
Listen. I know you can hear me.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.089
I know you're angry. I get it.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.967
And I'm sorry, for what it's worth.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.218
But I--

18:14.094 --> 18:16.263
Can we just talk, please, Alex?

18:19.641 --> 18:20.934
Where are you?

19:02.309 --> 19:03.519
I was watching that.

19:04.228 --> 19:05.270
You're up?

19:10.317 --> 19:12.819
Do you know how many
different kinds of knives there are?

19:13.445 --> 19:15.614
Yes, the world is a magical place.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.865
You should get some sleep.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.577
There was nothing in my bag, was there?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.205
Not this time.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.708
Look, I'm sorry. This is just--

19:26.792 --> 19:30.504
I'm tired, and it's a little surreal
that you're here shopping for knives

19:30.587 --> 19:32.214
while I go to work at 4:00 in the morning.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.465
I wasn't shopping.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.469
You would have to be on drugs
to buy knives that way.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.392
You don't have to worry about me.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.270
I left you a key.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.605
Make sure your phone is charged
if you go out.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.545
-Good morning.
-Hi, I'm Laura Peterson.

20:11.628 --> 20:15.215
Nice effort, but they know.
Your dressing room's this way.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.050
I'd like to say hi to Mia first.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.594
Well then, say hi you shall.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.345
This is such a mind-fuck.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.972
Back doing morning television.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.892
It's like Carrie being asked to speak
at the high school reunion.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.643
They're not gonna laugh at you.

20:26.727 --> 20:30.355
Laura. I saw your ranch
in Architectural Digest.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.440
Where's my invite?

20:31.523 --> 20:32.733
Good to see you.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.484
-What?
-Times have changed.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.944
You spit on these people, Laura.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.988
What are you talking about?
I don't spit on anyone.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.907
I'm just musing. That's what I do.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.867
And I act interested. That's what I do.

20:42.451 --> 20:44.286
-Hey, is your girlfriend here yet?
-Stop!

20:44.786 --> 20:47.164
Hi. Go ahead. She's just in with Gayle.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.583
-And that's me--
-Hey, guys.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.418
-Hi. Good morning.
-Reporting for duty.

20:51.502 --> 20:53.837
There she is. We are so glad to have you.

21:02.513 --> 21:05.682
Time to kiss the ring. You coming?

21:07.559 --> 21:09.645
Yeah. Let's go.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.649
Feels like just yesterday
we were kissing Alex's ring.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.486
I did try with her.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.739
I know. I get it.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.668
Don't forget this is your show.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.045
She's just a guest doing us a favor.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.296
I know, Gayle.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.548
Just making sure.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.175
The gang's all here.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.343
The whole mishpachah.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.682
-Laura, thank you so much for joining us.
-It's my pleasure.

21:47.516 --> 21:48.642
Have a preference?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.435
What are these?

21:50.519 --> 21:53.105
We're airing
a Marx Brothers tribute this week.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.399
Yeah, this year would be
Groucho's 130th birthday,

21:55.482 --> 21:58.026
so we thought it would be fun
if you guys wore the glasses.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.028
Yeah, I won't be doing that.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.488
Thirty seconds, everyone.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.323
-Okay, people, clear!
-We'll get out of your hair.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.825
Well, thanks again.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.161
Yeah, we're gonna catch the start of it
from the control room. Knock 'em dead.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.208
-So what are we doing exactly?
-Clear!

22:13.292 --> 22:14.585
Just follow my lead. You'll be fine.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.086
-Ten, nine…
-Oh, okay.

22:16.170 --> 22:21.925
…eight, seven, six, five, four…

22:22.426 --> 22:23.594
This is exciting.

22:24.178 --> 22:26.138
Good morning. Breaking overnight:

22:26.221 --> 22:29.308
Coronavirus continues its spread
across the globe.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.894
Italy is now home
to seven confirmed deaths

22:31.977 --> 22:35.272
as the total cases have risen to 283.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.608
-Thirty seconds.
-The spike has prompted quarantines

22:37.691 --> 22:40.027
and increased travel restrictions
to and from the country.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.613
Hey. Are you okay?

22:42.696 --> 22:44.865
President Trump again suggested
coronavirus would go away.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.491
What do you mean? I'm fine.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.702
Okay. I'll head up then.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.705
Stand by for live feed.

22:51.788 --> 22:56.168
It's Tuesday, February 25th, 2020,
and this is The Morning Show

22:56.251 --> 22:59.922
with Bradley Jackson
and special guest anchor, Laura Peterson.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.175
Thank you for joining us
on this Tuesday morning,

23:03.258 --> 23:05.677
and no, your eyes are not deceiving you.

23:05.761 --> 23:09.348
We're joined this morning by the one,
the only, Laura Peterson.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.724
-Welcome, Laura.
-Thank you.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.184
It's so nice waking up with you.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.062
Well, I did swear I would never
set my alarm this early again,

23:15.145 --> 23:16.188
but I'm glad I did.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.898
Well, we're glad too.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.483
Our top stories this morning.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.652
Why don't you go back
to your shitty country

23:21.735 --> 23:23.445
and stay the fuck out of ours, dickhead?

23:23.529 --> 23:24.947
Fucking island beaner.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.208
-Stella.
-Morning.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.794
I understand you're meeting
with Yanko Flores this morning.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.254
In about 15 minutes.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.506
And I trust you will do the right thing,

23:42.589 --> 23:44.591
that you won't let
your personal involvement

23:44.675 --> 23:45.759
cloud your judgment?

23:46.260 --> 23:48.929
My personal involvement
will have nothing to do with it.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.597
All due respect, Cybil,

23:50.681 --> 23:52.057
these decisions can be made

23:52.140 --> 23:54.518
without you feeling
the need to stand over me.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.645
All due respect,

23:57.521 --> 23:59.523
I'm giving you all the respect that's due.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.693
You and Cory were brought in
to clean things up

24:02.776 --> 24:05.779
and, God willing,
bring some order to this place.

24:06.530 --> 24:07.823
We fired Ray Marcus--

24:07.906 --> 24:09.700
After it became a scandal.

24:09.783 --> 24:12.202
And you hired Alex Levy.

24:12.286 --> 24:14.788
So far we've gotten,
what, seven days' work

24:15.289 --> 24:18.083
and a very public vanishing act
for our money.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.920
-You should talk to Cory about Alex.
-I'm talking to you.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.090
Talent is running roughshod over you.

24:25.174 --> 24:28.051
These aren't earthquakes. They're people.

24:28.719 --> 24:33.182
You can control them, and if you can't,
you find people you can.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.476
Now, I made it very clear to Cory

24:36.560 --> 24:40.856
that it was the board's position
that Bradley Jackson needed to be fired

24:40.939 --> 24:42.399
during her mystery illness,

24:42.482 --> 24:45.027
but you two just put her on air
the next morning.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.403
That is news to me.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.450
Take some responsibility.

24:52.451 --> 24:53.952
Show some character.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.455
Cory's gone to bat for you plenty.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.290
It's why you're here.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.460
So don't act like you two
aren't Frick and Frack.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.254
Frick and Frack?

25:04.338 --> 25:06.882
Oh, Christ. You're young.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.968
You're a package deal,

25:11.136 --> 25:14.306
but you can choose where your loyalty is.

25:16.308 --> 25:19.520
Who do you think's gonna be here
after the bomb goes off?

25:19.603 --> 25:21.730
I'm a cockroach, Stella.

25:22.648 --> 25:24.483
I will always be here.

25:29.363 --> 25:31.532
February is American Heart Month.

25:31.615 --> 25:36.870
More than 2,000 people in the US die
every day as the result of heart disease.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.205
Many of them are women.

25:38.288 --> 25:41.625
Now, it's just an odd coincidence
that I'm here today,

25:41.708 --> 25:45.796
but if you'll pardon the turn of phrase,
this is a cause near and dear to my heart.

25:45.879 --> 25:49.550
Well, I am glad you're here, because
you can speak from firsthand experience

25:49.633 --> 25:52.386
just how important it is to take care
of your heart from an early age.

25:52.469 --> 25:55.973
Obviously, blood pressure
and cholesterol are key factors,

25:56.056 --> 25:58.559
but we're gonna focus
on some more overlooked factors.

25:58.642 --> 26:00.269
Okay. So what's the first one?

26:00.352 --> 26:01.812
-Take three.
-Sleep.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.898
So many of us are not getting
anywhere near enough sleep.

26:04.982 --> 26:08.110
Yeah, there's no way you get enough sleep
in this job, is there, Bradley?

26:08.193 --> 26:10.237
-You have to get up so early every day.
-Well...

26:10.320 --> 26:12.614
And there's always something
to keep you up at night.

26:12.698 --> 26:15.951
A good night's sleep
needs to be a priority.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.370
The next major factor is stress.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.956
I know being an anchor
is a high-stress job,

26:21.039 --> 26:23.625
but we need to find
healthy outlets for stress relief,

26:23.709 --> 26:26.670
like exercise or even sex.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.464
What if that is your unhealthy choice?

26:31.466 --> 26:33.719
-Now, Doctor…
-Alex is gonna hate this.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.387
Yeah, well, she can call the switchboard

26:35.470 --> 26:37.723
and complain like everyone else
watching from home.

26:37.806 --> 26:41.101
…it would be helpful to hear
what a healthy heart rate sounds like.

26:41.185 --> 26:42.477
Okay. I'll be the doctor.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.938
-Well, go for it. It's your show.
-Okay.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.816
-Are you gonna be the patient?
-I'll be the patient, Doctor.

26:48.984 --> 26:51.278
All right. Here we go.

26:51.361 --> 26:54.698
Let's see. I don't have a watch on,
but I'll just count in my head.

26:55.324 --> 26:58.744
This feels pretty fast.
You need to calm down, Laura.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.537
If I'm above resting,

27:00.621 --> 27:04.249
does that mean I'm losing calories
just right now as I'm standing here?

27:11.423 --> 27:12.883
-Hey.
-Hi.

27:12.966 --> 27:13.967
Come in.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.474
-Does that hurt? It looks like it hurts.
-No. No, it's not--

27:20.557 --> 27:23.060
It's fine. I mean, it's a little tender,
you know? But it's not--

27:23.143 --> 27:24.394
It's not that bad.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.939
You could put concealer on it, or--

27:28.023 --> 27:29.650
People already insist I wear eye makeup.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.319
-I really don't wanna make 'em right.
-Yeah.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.821
Well, it looks manly.

27:34.905 --> 27:38.325
I mean, we don't want our weatherman
to have a shiner, but you wear it well.

27:38.408 --> 27:39.826
Okay, well, thank you. I think.

27:41.578 --> 27:44.456
So I wanted to thank you
for sticking up for me.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.667
You didn't have to,
and you really shouldn't have,

27:46.750 --> 27:48.710
-but it did mean a lot to me.
-Well, I did. Okay.

27:48.794 --> 27:53.549
But I did have to.
I mean, that guy way crossed the line.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.467
-Yeah.
-Right.

27:55.551 --> 27:59.263
And, plus, you never forget
being the weird Cuban kid, you know?

28:00.055 --> 28:01.056
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:01.139 --> 28:04.560
Well, I imagine you never forget
being the weird Korean kid either, right?

28:04.643 --> 28:06.186
I'm still the weird Korean kid.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.896
It turns out,
that's actually a good thing.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.233
Yeah-- Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, weird is grossly underrated.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.527
Yeah. Anyway, thank you.

28:13.610 --> 28:16.154
Nah. I'm glad I could help.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.198
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:18.949 --> 28:21.493
-Well…
-Where you going?

28:22.244 --> 28:24.538
I still do need to suspend you.

28:25.289 --> 28:26.290
What?

28:26.957 --> 28:28.876
You're gonna suspend me
for sticking up for you?

28:28.959 --> 28:31.128
You're the weatherman on The Morning Show.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.422
We can't have you hitting people
on the street.

28:34.673 --> 28:35.966
Hold on. I--

28:36.049 --> 28:38.385
Okay, so I'm a racist
when I said spirit animal.

28:38.468 --> 28:40.929
I beat up a racist,
and now you're suspending me.

28:41.013 --> 28:43.557
You didn't just beat him up,
you beat the shit out of him.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.351
-He could press charges, he could sue.
-No, he put his hands on me--

28:46.435 --> 28:48.896
Oh, my God.
You can't fucking win around here.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.272
I don't know what to tell you.

28:50.355 --> 28:53.692
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Seriously, what am I supposed to do?

28:54.276 --> 28:55.402
The weather.

28:57.613 --> 28:59.072
Don't make me the enemy.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.661
Let's go to local weather now
and see what's happening…

29:04.745 --> 29:06.997
Why am I hungry?
I don't usually eat until noon.

29:07.497 --> 29:08.749
And we're out.

29:08.832 --> 29:09.875
Back in 60 seconds.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.170
-Who's that?
-Bart. He's a weirdo.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.674
No.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.225
-Everything okay with your brother?
-Yeah, I think so.

29:31.313 --> 29:32.481
What's going on?

29:33.607 --> 29:34.608
I don't know.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.041
You'll be fine.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.669
You'll be fine.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.463
Ten seconds.

29:56.547 --> 29:58.340
In ten…

30:06.890 --> 30:07.891
Miss Jackson.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.949
Bradley, the glasses.

30:24.032 --> 30:26.451
Start your move. Cue her.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.039
It's the craziest thing we ever heard,

30:31.123 --> 30:35.711
but 2020 marks the 130th birthday
of Groucho Marx.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.264
-Is it true?
-I guess so.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.063
He famously said
he'd never want to join a club

30:55.147 --> 30:57.983
-that would have him as a member, but…
-Four, widen out, please.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.694
…after watching this special,
there'll be many more new members

31:00.777 --> 31:01.945
-of the Groucho Marx fan club.
-Stand by, two.

31:03.071 --> 31:04.990
Well, this will stop the ratings slump.

31:05.073 --> 31:08.952
…antics of Groucho, Chico, Harpo,
and sometimes Zeppo and Gummo,

31:09.036 --> 31:10.996
-we're welcoming comedian…
-Holy shit.

31:11.079 --> 31:13.123
-…and friend of Groucho, Tom Ballantine.
-One, ready.

31:13.207 --> 31:16.126
-Thanks, Tom, for being here.
-Take it, one. Good. Take four.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.337
Thanks.
These days, I'm happy to be anywhere.

31:18.420 --> 31:21.089
-One.
-It's a joke, but it's also true.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.883
-Take it, one.
-That's funny.

31:22.966 --> 31:25.135
-I guess I can take these off now.
-Sorry about that.

31:25.219 --> 31:27.387
-Stand by, two.
-Those are glasses?

31:27.471 --> 31:31.642
Believe it or not,
that's actually not a bad disguise.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.852
-You okay?
-I'm fine,

31:34.645 --> 31:36.063
but my day just got shitty.

31:36.146 --> 31:37.606
What was he like in real life?

31:37.689 --> 31:41.318
Funny, if you could believe it.
Boy, I mean, we had mornings…

31:41.401 --> 31:42.986
She really goes through them, doesn't she?

31:43.070 --> 31:44.988
-I doubt that it's true.
-I don't.

31:45.531 --> 31:46.532
There's a vibe.

31:46.615 --> 31:48.742
Is it bad that I think this is hot?

31:48.825 --> 31:50.327
-Yes.
-Why?

31:50.911 --> 31:52.955
-I'm not sure.
-You're sexualizing them.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.331
But I'm not. The story is.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.125
Do you have
a favorite Marx Brothers movie?

31:57.209 --> 31:58.460
-Do you think it's true?
-Love Happy.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.629
-I've never seen that one.
-I hope not.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.798
-I loved it.
-'Cause being gay's your thing?

32:03.465 --> 32:06.885
No, because I think it's horrible
and painful to be publicly outed,

32:06.969 --> 32:08.637
and it's nobody's fucking business.

32:09.763 --> 32:10.764
I'm sorry.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.475
Okay, we will. Allegedly.

32:13.559 --> 32:16.353
-We have to say that for legal reasons.
-Sure. Allegedly.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.063
-Okay.
-Okay?

32:18.146 --> 32:21.650
Well, that's such a great story.
Thank you so much for being here, Tom.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.027
Groucho and the Marx Brothers
airs tomorrow night

32:24.111 --> 32:26.446
on UBA, 8:00, 7:00 Central.

32:26.530 --> 32:30.492
Let's see some of those classic moments
that made the Marx Brothers so beloved.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.828
And we're out. Back in two minutes.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.123
Gayle, can I use the facilities
really quick?

32:36.206 --> 32:38.625
-Do I have a minute?
-You do. Everything okay?

32:38.709 --> 32:41.170
Yeah. Pardon me,
I just have to go deal with something.

32:41.253 --> 32:44.256
-Okay.
-Wait. Where is she going?

32:45.465 --> 32:46.675
Where's she going?

33:03.525 --> 33:05.360
Could you cover the next segment?

33:05.444 --> 33:07.196
-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.742
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:12.409 --> 33:13.535
Oh, fuck!

33:17.873 --> 33:19.917
Oh, no, no.
You can't be in here right now.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.001
-Why?
-No, no, no. Get out.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.085
-Get out now.
-Why?

33:22.169 --> 33:26.256
Because if people see us going out
of the same room, that's not good.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.674
Well, if it were true,

33:27.758 --> 33:29.801
then we would have to make sure
we weren't seen together.

33:29.885 --> 33:32.471
But we just had bullshit gossip
published about us,

33:32.554 --> 33:34.681
so we're in here
discussing how to handle it.

33:35.432 --> 33:38.519
-But it is true.
-Oh, boy, you are so not cool.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.479
This isn't funny. This isn't funny!

33:40.562 --> 33:44.191
-I don't think any of it's funny actually.
-Neither do I!

33:45.442 --> 33:49.947
Look, someone being outed
against their will, I'm having flashbacks.

33:50.030 --> 33:51.740
This is not about being outed.

33:52.699 --> 33:55.452
-So you're not embarrassed?
-No, no, no. I'm not.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.497
-I'm not. I'm not.
-Then why are you so upset?

33:59.957 --> 34:02.334
Because I don't want
my private life public.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.962
I'm just a private person, Laura,

34:05.045 --> 34:07.464
and I don't want people talking
about anybody that I'm sleeping with,

34:07.548 --> 34:09.507
much less the person I'm sitting next to.

34:09.591 --> 34:12.010
And I just feel like
everybody's staring at us.

34:12.094 --> 34:15.681
Well, they are. There are cameras
pointing at us. We're on TV.

34:16.723 --> 34:19.518
-I'm sorry. I--
-Look. You are gonna go home.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.980
You'll draw yourself a bath,
shut out the world for the night,

34:23.063 --> 34:24.898
and things will be better in the morning.

34:26.024 --> 34:28.902
But I--
It's 8:00 in the morning, and I can't--

34:28.985 --> 34:31.405
I can't go back to my hotel room.
My brother's there.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.156
And he's so fucked up.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.534
He's just watching some
stupid fucking show about bowie knives.

34:36.618 --> 34:38.911
-And you can't talk to him?
-No. You don't know my family.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.623
They're just-- He's probably on drugs,
or he has some problem

34:41.706 --> 34:44.293
that's just bigger than all my problems,
and I just-- I don't want--

34:44.376 --> 34:47.254
I don't want anybody knowing my business.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.839
Especially my family.

34:49.882 --> 34:53.594
Page Six published a rumor
about Alex and Mitch a million years ago.

34:53.677 --> 34:55.929
-Exactly. Yes.
-No big deal.

34:56.013 --> 34:57.931
They didn't respond, and it was a blip.

34:58.015 --> 35:02.561
Really, was it? Because I remember
you asking Alex if she was fucking Mitch.

35:02.644 --> 35:05.063
Yeah, well, don't be horrible to people,
and you'll be fine.

35:05.147 --> 35:08.817
Look.
There is a live show going on right now,

35:08.901 --> 35:10.944
-and we are supposed to be on it.
-I know, but I'm serious.

35:11.028 --> 35:13.363
-I can't have people judging me.
-Judging you for what?

35:13.447 --> 35:14.448
For--

35:14.531 --> 35:18.577
If people know that I'm in a relationship,
then they'll know when it ends.

35:19.328 --> 35:21.121
And I, honestly…

35:21.205 --> 35:24.875
I haven't had a relationship
past a few months my entire life.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.127
Because I get bored or I get restless

35:27.211 --> 35:31.298
or I find out somebody's not
who they said they were or I…

35:31.882 --> 35:33.133
I leave.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.969
Bradley, we need to get back.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.935
And you're right.
This is totally fucked up.

35:44.269 --> 35:45.896
But I promise you, it'll be okay.

35:47.731 --> 35:50.067
You take your time. I've got you covered.

35:55.572 --> 35:56.573
Twenty seconds.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.537
Quiet, please.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.374
-Right in the nick of time.
-Ten seconds.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.501
-Clear.
-Thank you.

36:07.584 --> 36:08.710
-Eight…
-Nice going.

36:08.794 --> 36:14.424
Seven, six, five, four, three, two…

36:14.925 --> 36:16.260
Of course I watched it. I don't miss one.

36:16.343 --> 36:17.803
I thought it was an amazing premiere.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.806
Amazing? Come on. Calm down.
It was okay. It was okay.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.850
What do you need,
Daniel Henderson, to be happy?

36:22.933 --> 36:24.101
-I mean…
-What does it take?

36:24.184 --> 36:26.436
Look. Calm down. All right?

36:26.520 --> 36:29.857
I thought that the talent was mediocre.

36:29.940 --> 36:32.067
Just put the singers to the side
for a second.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.194
-Look at the show overall.
-Put the singers to the side?

36:34.278 --> 36:36.446
-It's a singing competition.
-You okay?

36:36.530 --> 36:39.074
They have a Backstreet Boy as a judge.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.118
Honestly, I have no idea what's going on.

36:41.201 --> 36:44.288
If Isabella wasn't talking to her,
I'd be freaking the fuck out.

36:44.371 --> 36:47.541
I mean, it's been, like,
a week since I've--

36:47.624 --> 36:49.751
-You gotta be fucking kidding me.
-Oh, shit.

36:51.336 --> 36:52.880
You got one job, Chip.

36:52.963 --> 36:56.091
Your one job is to babysit
a $25 million mistake,

36:56.175 --> 36:58.385
and you don't even know where she is?

36:58.468 --> 37:02.639
-Hold on. She's in her apartment. Okay--
-Lot of fucking good she's doing me there!

37:05.017 --> 37:07.895
And you. I hired you as a favor to him.

37:07.978 --> 37:09.938
And this is how you treat me
behind my back.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.440
Hold on, hold on.

37:11.523 --> 37:13.358
Be pissed at me all you want,
but what the fuck?

37:13.942 --> 37:17.237
Rena has nothing to do with this,
except for maybe being the one person here

37:17.321 --> 37:20.282
who doesn't treat my coming back
as something I'm doing to them.

37:23.785 --> 37:25.537
It's not your fault, Rena.

37:26.955 --> 37:31.126
That's not the same thing as an apology.
And what the fuck is going on with you?

37:32.127 --> 37:33.128
You lied.

37:35.506 --> 37:38.467
You told me you had been
in communication with Alex.

37:38.550 --> 37:39.635
Look…

37:40.886 --> 37:42.679
I'm trying to help. Okay?

37:46.225 --> 37:48.894
I can see you're obviously hurting.

37:49.895 --> 37:50.896
Can you?

37:53.774 --> 37:55.859
Can you see that, Chip?

37:59.029 --> 38:01.240
I'm sorry, Mia. Okay?

38:01.823 --> 38:03.784
I'm sorry for everything.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.870
I do want to help. I really do. I…

38:11.708 --> 38:13.877
Then get me my fucking lead anchor back.

38:17.506 --> 38:19.258
Yeah. Okay, boss.

38:42.364 --> 38:45.367
Hey, Bradley. You okay? You need anything?

38:45.951 --> 38:49.246
-Do you want me to order you dinner?
-Nope. All good.

38:49.788 --> 38:53.584
Did you want to return any calls?
They're kinda piling up.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.043
Your reps, at least?

38:55.919 --> 38:58.255
Nope. I'm sort of on a roll here.

38:59.006 --> 39:00.757
Gonna get some more work done.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.760
Okay. Have a good night.

39:29.203 --> 39:30.746
Fuck.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.133
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.427
How did the talk with your brother go?

39:45.511 --> 39:47.638
-I'm still in my dressing room.
-Still?

39:49.139 --> 39:51.266
-Yep.
-I understand.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.810
Look, come over. I'd like to see you.

39:53.894 --> 39:55.395
There's probably paparazzi,

39:55.479 --> 39:58.232
but you wouldn't be the first woman
to sneak in here undetected.

39:58.315 --> 40:01.276
It'd be good to see each other tonight,
of all nights.

40:03.362 --> 40:04.446
I can't.

40:05.822 --> 40:07.282
So, what?

40:07.366 --> 40:09.660
We're just not gonna see each other again?

40:09.743 --> 40:11.954
No, no, don't be crazy.

40:12.037 --> 40:16.708
Look, I get that today was tough for you,
but it wasn't nothing for me.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.419
Really? You seemed fine.

40:19.503 --> 40:22.548
My experience with morning TV
was traumatic.

40:23.257 --> 40:25.676
I got outed
when that could kill your career.

40:26.969 --> 40:28.178
But I got therapy.

40:29.054 --> 40:33.100
I made my peace, and I worked through it,

40:33.183 --> 40:36.562
to the point
where I thought it would be fun

40:36.645 --> 40:38.564
to come back and do a victory lap.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.440
And then I immediately got outed again.

40:41.275 --> 40:44.903
So it was traumatic for me.
I just know how to handle my shit.

40:44.987 --> 40:47.656
So was it traumatic
to be outed as with me?

40:47.739 --> 40:49.658
Because everybody knows you like girls.

40:50.826 --> 40:53.036
I'm gonna give you a chance
to withdraw that.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.123
Look, I'm sorry.
What do you want me to do?

40:56.206 --> 40:58.458
I told you what I wanted.
I wanted you to come over.

40:58.542 --> 41:00.419
-All right, I'll come over.
-Wanted.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.754
-Wanted, past tense.
-Laura, I'm sorry.

41:02.838 --> 41:03.964
I-- I'm--

41:04.047 --> 41:05.382
You don't know how I grew up.

41:05.465 --> 41:07.718
-My mom and my brother. I--
-You never stood a chance.

41:07.801 --> 41:11.305
I get it. I know why
you're the way you are. I really do, but--

41:11.388 --> 41:13.974
No, you don't.
My family is not like yours.

41:14.057 --> 41:15.184
Don't cut me off.

41:16.143 --> 41:20.147
And stop assuming that there's only
one path to fucking up your kids.

41:20.898 --> 41:23.817
But you're not a kid anymore.
Fucked-up kids have an excuse.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.737
Fucked-up adults get therapy.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.823
Fucked-up adults
change their circumstances.

41:29.907 --> 41:32.409
That's advice that I lived by.

41:33.035 --> 41:34.870
So do what you have to do--

41:34.953 --> 41:36.038
I'm sorry.

41:36.997 --> 41:41.627
Do what you have to do with your brother,
go home, and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

41:57.142 --> 41:58.560
Alex, it's Chip.

41:59.061 --> 42:02.022
I'm sorry I'm coming unannounced,
but I just--

42:02.648 --> 42:07.319
I mean, that's what happens
when you don't answer my texts or my calls

42:07.402 --> 42:11.281
or emails or my carrier pigeons.

42:12.824 --> 42:14.201
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:15.369 --> 42:17.829
What are you doing here?
I thought Madeleine was in town.

42:17.913 --> 42:21.250
Yeah, she is. I'm hoping to get back
to her soon, but I need to talk to Alex.

42:21.834 --> 42:22.918
Is she…

42:25.754 --> 42:28.382
in her bedroom? Is she asleep? Or…

42:32.594 --> 42:33.929
She's not here.

42:36.598 --> 42:37.724
What? She's not…

42:38.809 --> 42:41.478
-What? Where the fuck is she?
-I don't know.

42:41.562 --> 42:44.982
You know, all she said was
she was going somewhere for a few days,

42:45.065 --> 42:47.442
to check on her place,
and to not let anyone know.

42:47.526 --> 42:49.152
Yeah, I'm not anyone, so…

42:49.236 --> 42:51.029
No. She specified you.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.992
Wait. So, have you been speaking with her?

42:55.075 --> 42:58.203
Because I think you know
I've been trying pretty desperately

42:58.287 --> 42:59.538
to get in touch with her, yes?

43:00.122 --> 43:02.207
You realize this is fucking Mia over.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.375
Alex is my boss.

43:03.458 --> 43:04.918
Yes, and Mia is her boss.

43:05.002 --> 43:08.130
-Okay. Right.
-This is funny? Yeah.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.757
Okay, good.
Now I have to go track her down, right?

43:10.841 --> 43:12.885
Why would I wanna go have dinner
with my fiancée?

43:12.968 --> 43:15.262
Excuse me. Alex is a grown fucking woman.

43:15.345 --> 43:16.847
She doesn't need you to rescue her.

43:16.930 --> 43:19.683
Excuse me.
All due respect, not a gender thing.

43:20.309 --> 43:21.518
She really fucking does.

43:21.602 --> 43:22.644
Wow.

43:23.187 --> 43:24.188
Okay.

43:24.813 --> 43:26.857
Do you really not know where she is?

43:26.940 --> 43:28.775
I need you to tell me where she is.

43:30.235 --> 43:32.196
What-- Are you just not gonna talk to me?

43:32.279 --> 43:34.573
-What is with you people?
-What do you mean, "you people"?

43:34.656 --> 43:37.159
-Mediocre white men.
-What are you talking about?

43:37.242 --> 43:39.536
You're always fucking things up
for everybody,

43:39.620 --> 43:42.122
and you're always first in line
for second chances!

43:42.206 --> 43:45.959
You're not exceptional! I'm sorry,
you're not, and I am so sick of it!

43:46.043 --> 43:48.003
Oh, my God! What a fucking load!

43:52.633 --> 43:53.634
Okay.

43:54.593 --> 43:57.596
You're white. I'm-- Okay. All right.

43:58.180 --> 43:59.389
Oh, God.

44:00.724 --> 44:01.725
Fuck.

44:03.143 --> 44:05.020
Meet Liz Stebbins.

44:05.103 --> 44:08.982
When she took a trip to the dog pound
to heal her broken heart,

44:09.066 --> 44:11.610
she never imagined
it would start a journey

44:11.693 --> 44:13.987
that would define the rest of her life.

44:14.655 --> 44:18.700
Tonight, we revisit a story
we first brought you in 2013...

44:18.784 --> 44:24.706
...that chronicled the icy, grueling
journey of one Iditarod racer and her dogs

44:24.790 --> 44:28.836
who fought all the odds
just to get to the starting line.

44:53.235 --> 44:54.361
Did you sleep at all?

44:57.322 --> 44:58.782
I couldn't.

44:58.866 --> 45:01.910
Mom's been calling all day,
freaking the fuck out about you.

45:03.704 --> 45:07.082
Tell her if she really cares,
she can just call me herself.

45:07.165 --> 45:09.126
You tell her yourself,
'cause I'm not your middleman.

45:09.209 --> 45:11.128
Okay. Well, is she answering the phone?

45:11.211 --> 45:14.131
Has she finally gotten over my abortion
from 1995?

45:14.214 --> 45:17.759
No, she just asked me how
you got pregnant having sex with girls.

45:17.843 --> 45:19.178
What the fuck?

45:19.261 --> 45:21.054
She's embarrassed.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.391
I mean, what do you expect?
It's a small town.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.605
It's-- That's just bullshit.
People have advanced.

45:29.688 --> 45:31.857
Not mom's friends.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.942
But if you think they were so enlightened,

45:34.026 --> 45:37.779
why did you wait so long
to come out of the closet?

45:37.863 --> 45:40.908
-She'd be over it by now.
-This is called "being outed."

45:40.991 --> 45:43.994
Those are completely different things,
dumbass.

45:44.077 --> 45:47.539
This is just… Bradley,
this is really not a good time for this.

45:47.623 --> 45:51.668
It's not a good time? For who? For you?

45:52.336 --> 45:53.837
Who invited you here?

45:54.838 --> 45:56.673
You didn't have to
talk to Mom all day about it.

45:56.757 --> 46:00.093
Neither do you. You don't
have to take her fucking calls, Hal.

46:00.177 --> 46:02.179
Yeah, not everybody
can abandon our mother.

46:02.262 --> 46:04.598
She abandoned us
the minute we popped out of her.

46:04.681 --> 46:06.225
You do not owe her anything.

46:06.308 --> 46:09.102
Besides, I thought you came here
to get away from her.

46:09.186 --> 46:10.187
Look…

46:10.979 --> 46:13.315
I fucking came here
because I've been using.

46:16.443 --> 46:17.653
Fuck-- Okay?

46:20.572 --> 46:22.157
I'm sorry.

46:23.617 --> 46:28.872
I just--
I cannot handle living at home with Mom.

46:28.956 --> 46:30.207
I cannot do it.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.709
You know how she always said,
"You try being nice

46:32.793 --> 46:34.795
when you've been through
what I've been through."

46:37.297 --> 46:40.133
And like an idiot,
I thought you helping her out,

46:40.217 --> 46:42.636
making things easier for her,
that she would--

46:42.719 --> 46:45.055
she would just become less of a bitch.

46:45.138 --> 46:48.308
But… she got worse.

46:50.811 --> 46:55.983
I mean, she's got a big fucking head,
but she is still so fragile.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.651
You can knock her over with a feather.

46:57.734 --> 47:01.154
So I feel guilty about leaving her.

47:01.238 --> 47:06.201
But she makes me feel fucking guilty
about everything, and it is killing me!

47:13.333 --> 47:14.626
You know what I realized?

47:16.879 --> 47:19.173
I don't wanna die. I don't.

47:19.256 --> 47:23.302
But I don't care if I live…

47:24.469 --> 47:26.430
and that scares the shit out of me.

47:26.513 --> 47:29.266
I took my shit, I threw it off a cliff.
I did. It's gone!

47:29.349 --> 47:30.893
-Good.
-But that's why I'm here.

47:31.935 --> 47:36.315
Because I know if I'm around you,
then I won't get fucked up.

47:37.691 --> 47:42.613
Bradley, I'm fucking begging you.
You have to let me stay here.

47:42.696 --> 47:46.366
I need to be here,
but this is not helping.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.540
This is a lot to put on me right now, Hal.

47:53.624 --> 47:54.625
I know.

47:55.250 --> 47:56.251
It's too much.

47:57.961 --> 47:59.213
I can't deal with it.

48:02.257 --> 48:05.385
I'm sorry. I just-- I thought you cared.

48:05.469 --> 48:07.763
I do care. You need to go to rehab.

48:07.846 --> 48:11.225
-I'm not a fucking doctor.
-Rehab? Rehab is expensive.

48:11.308 --> 48:12.851
-I don't…
-I'll pay for it.

48:12.935 --> 48:14.436
No! No!

48:15.020 --> 48:17.648
I'm not gonna ask you for that.
I'm not gonna ask you for money.

48:17.731 --> 48:19.608
I paid for it last time.
I didn't have any fucking money.

48:19.691 --> 48:20.817
-Do you remember that?
-Yes,

48:20.901 --> 48:23.153
but now that you do, it's a thing.

48:23.237 --> 48:27.115
Whatever. Don't get on my case
about being considerate.

48:27.199 --> 48:29.451
-This is considerate?
-Yes, this is considerate.

48:29.535 --> 48:32.162
Hey, and by the way,
don't give me that bullshit

48:32.246 --> 48:36.583
about you not being a lesbian
or bi or whatever.

48:36.667 --> 48:39.002
The walls in that house
are pretty fucking thin.

48:39.086 --> 48:42.965
I want you to think
about what you're doing and don't.

48:43.882 --> 48:47.010
I have had an awful, awful day,

48:47.094 --> 48:50.764
and I cannot have you
taking out your anger at Mom on me.

48:50.848 --> 48:54.059
No, no, no, Bradley.
This anger belongs to you.

48:54.142 --> 48:57.145
Because everything, Bradley,
is always about you!

48:57.229 --> 48:59.773
Oh, my God! You are so full of shit!
