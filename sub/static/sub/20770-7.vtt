WEBVTT

02:22.810 --> 02:24.186
<i>Jerry?</i>

02:28.107 --> 02:29.567
Jerry?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.532
Jerry?

02:37.324 --> 02:41.328
- <i>Jerry, what's going on?</i>
- Someone stole my car.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.039
What?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.042
Didn't I tell you?

02:47.168 --> 02:49.879
Jerry, what's going on?

02:50.004 --> 02:52.006
Someone stole your car?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.343
You say the same thing?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.097
What?

03:05.895 --> 03:07.646
Jerry.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.692
I think I'm high!

03:13.861 --> 03:16.197
Oh, good Lord, Jerry.

03:18.324 --> 03:21.577
I don't know where I am!

03:39.762 --> 03:41.764
This is what I found.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.432
From Laura Palmer?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.892
Yeah.

03:50.147 --> 03:54.777
"This came to me
in a dream last night.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.238
'My name is Annie.

03:57.363 --> 04:00.282
I've been with Dale and Laura.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.409
The good Dale is in the lodge,

04:02.534 --> 04:04.620
and he can't leave.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.539
Write it in your diary.'"
Unquote.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.336
"Dale" as in
Special Agent Dale Cooper?

04:12.461 --> 04:13.921
Right.

04:17.299 --> 04:18.717
What do you think this means?

04:20.261 --> 04:21.971
I don't know,
but I'm sure

04:22.096 --> 04:25.766
this is what the Log Lady
wanted me to find.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.645
I think that "Annie"
is Annie Blackburn, a...

04:29.770 --> 04:32.147
a girl that went
into that place.

04:33.107 --> 04:37.486
And these pages are for sure
from Laura's diary?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.280
Yeah, these are
from her diary,

04:39.405 --> 04:43.659
the diary found at her friend
Harold Smith's.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.328
These are three of the four
pages that we saw

04:46.453 --> 04:50.708
were torn out, missing.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.210
And there's‒
there's still one missing.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.671
And how do you think
they got here,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.966
inside our bathroom stall door?

05:00.134 --> 05:02.928
I'm not sure,
but look at this.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.391
"It's 1:30 a.m.

05:07.516 --> 05:11.478
I'm crying so hard,
I can hardly breathe.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.565
Now I know it isn't Bob.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.483
I know who it is."

05:18.527 --> 05:21.155
I'm sure it was Leland
who hid these pages.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.782
He found 'em
and realized that she knew.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.703
Well, I remember this.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.706
Leland Palmer, her father.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.335
When do you think he hid these?

05:36.003 --> 05:36.920
I don't know.

05:37.046 --> 05:40.841
Leland came into the station
several times.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.010
Once around that time,

05:43.135 --> 05:44.511
we brought him in
for the questioning

05:44.636 --> 05:47.264
of the murder
of Jacques Renault.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.016
Maybe he thought
we were gonna frisk him,

05:49.141 --> 05:50.392
and that's when he hid 'em.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.066
Laura never met Cooper.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.610
He came here after she died,
didn't he?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.906
She said
that these words from Annie

06:04.031 --> 06:06.241
came to her in a dream.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.580
This thing she said‒

06:11.705 --> 06:13.749
"the good Dale
is in the lodge"

06:13.874 --> 06:15.918
and can't come out.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.252
But Harry saw Cooper

06:17.378 --> 06:19.963
come out of the lodge
with Annie that night.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.674
Doc and Harry took him over
to the Great Northern.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.929
But if the good Cooper
is in the lodge

06:27.054 --> 06:29.598
and can't come out,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.976
then the one who came out
of the lodge

06:33.102 --> 06:34.978
with Annie that night...

06:37.314 --> 06:39.024
...was not the good Cooper.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.114
And he left town soon after.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.283
Who else saw him that day?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.452
Well, like I said, Doc Hayward,

06:50.577 --> 06:51.912
but I don't know who else.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.959
Let's bring Harry up to speed,

06:57.084 --> 06:58.544
see what he thinks.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.342
Can you get him for me?

07:07.302 --> 07:08.637
I'd be happy to wait.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.144
Harry.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.937
Where the hell they got ya?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.567
Oh, no kidding.

07:23.152 --> 07:26.321
Damn.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.240
I'm sorry, Harry.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.871
Uh, just wanted to talk to you
about a few things.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.082
Oh. Right.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.501
W‒Get some rest.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.170
I'll check in later.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.548
No, nothing urgent.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.801
Don't worry about it.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.137
Just get rest, and...

07:50.262 --> 07:52.890
and, Harry, do me a favor.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.185
Beat this thing.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.689
All right, brother.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.857
Later.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.995
- But that's your truck.
- I know it's my truck.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.580
I can't talk to you
about this here.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.707
I told you.
Please go away.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.084
But if you weren't driving,
I need to know who was.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.045
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you the whole story.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.213
I'll meet you somewhere,

08:24.338 --> 08:25.756
but I can't talk to you here.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.841
Please, you've got
to get out of here now.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.552
The logging road
above Sparkwood and 21.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.888
By Jones'?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.390
Just past Jones',
down by the creek.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.892
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know it.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.435
See you there.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.105
Um, I-I'll meet you there
in two hours.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.275
4:30, then.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.819
P-please leave.
Please leave now.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.053
Is that you, Doc?

09:13.178 --> 09:16.014
This is Sheriff Frank Truman calling.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.225
<i>Good to hear your voice.</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:19.935
<i>Where's Harry?</i>

09:20.060 --> 09:22.896
Harry's, uh, a little
under the weather these days.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.108
<i>Yeah?
Well, give my best to him.</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:29.111
Uh, do you know
what Skype is, Doc?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.154
<i>I use it all the time.</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:35.576
<i>Just the other day, I diagnosed
Mrs. Mueller's eczema.</i>

09:35.701 --> 09:37.953
<i>Never had to get out
of my chair.</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:39.788
What's your Skype handle, Doc?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.665
I'll, uh, saddle up.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.584
<i>MiddleburyDoc.</i>

09:48.422 --> 09:50.090
Be right with you, Doc.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.844
Now...

10:19.036 --> 10:21.330
There you are, Doc.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.624
<i>What's this all about?</i>

10:23.749 --> 10:27.502
Doc, do you remember
way back when,

10:27.628 --> 10:29.379
the night Harry called you in

10:29.504 --> 10:32.132
to examine
Special Agent Dale Cooper

10:32.257 --> 10:33.675
at the Great Northern?

10:35.177 --> 10:39.681
<i>I can't remember what I had
for breakfast this morning,</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:42.225
<i>but I remember that.</i>

10:42.351 --> 10:43.852
Tell me what you remember.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.271
<i>Well, we all knew Coop,</i>

10:46.396 --> 10:49.983
<i>but that morning,
he was acting mighty...</i>

10:50.108 --> 10:52.653
<i>strange.</i>

10:52.778 --> 10:53.862
And?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.073
<i>I took him to the hospital,</i>

10:56.198 --> 10:59.910
<i>and I had him checked out
while I made my rounds.</i>

11:00.035 --> 11:02.871
<i>About an hour later,</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.540
<i>I saw him sneaking
out of intensive care,</i>

11:05.666 --> 11:07.376
<i>fully dressed.</i>

11:07.501 --> 11:10.045
<i>He</i>‒<i>he turned, and</i>‒

11:10.170 --> 11:13.548
<i>and he looked at me, and...</i>

11:13.674 --> 11:17.552
<i>I saw that strange face again.</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:19.346
<i>I called out to him,</i>

11:19.471 --> 11:21.765
<i>but he didn't say a word.</i>

11:21.890 --> 11:24.976
<i>He just turned around
and walked out.</i>

11:25.102 --> 11:27.270
What was he doing
in intensive care?

11:27.396 --> 11:29.231
<i>I-I thought at the time</i>

11:29.356 --> 11:32.776
<i>he might have been looking in
on Audrey Horne.</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:37.239
<i>That terrible business
at the bank, and...</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:41.410
<i>She was in a coma.</i>

11:46.081 --> 11:47.749
How they biting
back there, Doc?

11:47.874 --> 11:51.461
<i>You know,
just the other morning,</i>

11:51.586 --> 11:55.424
<i>I caught two brown trout
in my pajamas.</i>

11:55.549 --> 11:56.550
Yeah?

11:56.675 --> 11:58.593
<i>How they got in my pajamas,</i>

11:58.719 --> 12:00.429
<i>I'll</i>‒<i>I'll never know.</i>

12:01.888 --> 12:03.640
Did you make a breakfast
out of them?

12:03.765 --> 12:08.311
<i>Panfried 'em
right out there by the river.</i>

12:08.437 --> 12:11.898
<i>I had some
scrambled eggs and...</i>

12:12.023 --> 12:14.109
<i>...and an English muffin</i>

12:14.234 --> 12:16.987
<i>with huckleberry jam.</i>

12:18.238 --> 12:19.489
Yeah.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.575
Mighty good talking to you, Doc.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.618
I'll give your good wishes
to Harry.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.455
<i>Whatever this is about,</i>

12:26.580 --> 12:30.876
<i>well, I hope it turns out
all right for you.</i>

12:31.001 --> 12:33.879
Keep working the sunny side
of the river, Doc.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.464
<i>Ah...</i>

12:35.589 --> 12:37.674
<i>so long, Frank.</i>

12:55.942 --> 12:57.110
Detective Macklay?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.405
I'm Lieutenant Knox.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.823
Oh, yes, Lieutenant.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.116
It's good to meet you.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.826
Detective.
Thanks for seeing me.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.328
This shouldn't take long.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.871
You submitted
a set of fingerprints

13:07.996 --> 13:09.664
a few days ago
to our database,

13:09.790 --> 13:12.000
and we need to verify
the source.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.127
Well, I can show them to you,

13:14.252 --> 13:17.255
but our search was blocked.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.466
That must have been
from your end?

13:21.259 --> 13:23.345
I'd like to see
the prints, please.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.264
Where did you lift them from‒
a crime scene?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.809
No.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.727
Off the body.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.022
There's a body?

13:34.147 --> 13:37.692
There's a body, all right.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.170
Where's the rest of him?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.090
We don't know.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.389
How old was this man?

14:10.141 --> 14:11.768
Late 40s.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.399
When did this man die?

14:18.191 --> 14:22.195
Within the last five
or six days.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.743
You're sure this is the body

14:28.869 --> 14:30.245
you took those prints from?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.872
Yeah.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.125
I'm happy to pull 'em again
for you, if you like.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.545
It would sure help our investigation
to know who this is.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.801
Excuse me for a moment.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.602
Sir.
Lieutenant Knox, sir.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.440
It's not just prints this time.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.649
It's a body.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.944
<i>It's him.</i>

15:04.195 --> 15:05.780
You're sure?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.116
<i>The prints came off this body.</i>

15:11.036 --> 15:13.121
Okay.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.123
Okay.
I have to make that other call.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.875
There's just one thing, sir.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.835
What's that?

15:19.961 --> 15:22.130
Actually, two things.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.132
The head is missing.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.426
And he's the wrong age.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.804
What do you mean, Cindy?

15:31.389 --> 15:32.933
What I mean

15:33.058 --> 15:36.519
is that his head
is not here.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.063
It's missing,

15:38.188 --> 15:39.606
<i>and the body</i>

15:39.731 --> 15:42.192
<i>is that of a man
in his late 40s</i>

15:42.317 --> 15:44.694
who died a few days ago.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.864
If he died recently,

15:47.989 --> 15:50.075
Major Briggs should be
in his 70s.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.494
<i>There must be some mistake.</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:54.996
I've seen the body myself.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.958
Coroner verified the age
and the prints.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.003
Stay there.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.672
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

16:05.256 --> 16:07.175
<i>I'm making
that other call now.</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:13.682
Yes, sir.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.370
No one else gets access
to this body.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.749
You care to share
any of this with us?

16:39.874 --> 16:43.336
You didn't hear it from me...

16:43.461 --> 16:46.589
but I don't think this is going
to be your investigation

16:46.715 --> 16:48.216
for too much longer.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.421
Yes?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.756
Come in.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.138
How did it go?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.098
Not well.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.933
I said, "Hello, Diane."

17:39.059 --> 17:40.769
She said, "This is about Cooper,
isn't it?"

17:40.894 --> 17:43.438
I said, "Maybe."

17:43.563 --> 17:45.482
She said, and I quote,

17:45.607 --> 17:46.775
"No fucking way."

17:48.693 --> 17:50.111
Oh.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.613
I was at home, dripping wet,

17:51.738 --> 17:54.491
on the verge of pneumonia
15 minutes later.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.494
How was your evening, Chief?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.997
This is not good news, Albert.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.916
She needs to see him.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.585
Your turn.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.003
But you'll go with me?

18:09.756 --> 18:12.509
- Say "please."
- What?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.469
You heard me.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.265
Please.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.953
FBI, champ.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.746
Friends of Diane.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.248
Come on in.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.919
Who is it?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.762
Oh, my God.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.558
See you later, Diane.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.977
Yeah, see you later.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.357
Well, this won't take long.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.026
I'm just gonna say the same thing
to you I said to him.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.903
Now, take it easy, Diane,

19:14.028 --> 19:15.655
and let's just sit down

19:15.780 --> 19:17.657
and have a nice, simple chat.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.368
- You got any coffee?
- No.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.704
I don't have
any cigarettes either.

19:22.829 --> 19:26.207
Ah, the memory of tobacco.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.668
But I gave it up.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.545
Fuck you, Gordon.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.714
Now you're getting
the personal treatment.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.884
Oh, you want personal?
Fuck you too, Albert.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.762
Now that we got the pleasantries
out of the way.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.432
I never even got this far.

19:42.557 --> 19:45.727
Diane, your former boss

19:45.852 --> 19:49.230
and former
Special Agent Dale Cooper

19:49.355 --> 19:52.775
is in a federal lockup
in South Dakota.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.320
Good.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.240
Diane, this may require

19:59.365 --> 20:02.118
a slight change of attitude
on your part.

20:02.243 --> 20:06.206
My attitude is none
of your fucking business.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.215
Tough cookie.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.553
Always was.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.934
Thank you, Diane.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.569
Damn good coffee.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.908
So?

20:43.952 --> 20:46.454
Say what you came here to say.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.586
We have a feeling
something is wrong.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.964
We don't know exactly
what it is,

20:56.089 --> 20:58.633
but we need someone else
who knows him extremely well

20:58.758 --> 21:00.593
to have a talk with him
and afterwards

21:00.718 --> 21:01.928
tell us what you think.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.808
This is
extremely important, Diane,

21:06.933 --> 21:10.353
and it involves something
that you know about,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.772
and that's enough said
about that.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.613
Federal prison...

21:20.738 --> 21:22.657
South Dakota.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.637
Judge not, lest ye be judged.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.352
Listen, just the fact that you're here
speaks louder than words.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.981
Fuck you, Albert.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.037
Look at this.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.503
Cooper 25 years ago...

22:17.628 --> 22:20.923
Cooper in prison two days ago.

22:21.049 --> 22:23.301
Identical, right?

22:23.426 --> 22:25.053
Maybe.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.387
What do you see?

22:27.889 --> 22:30.224
This code mark's
on the wrong side.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.517
What does that tell you?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.561
That some Cro-Magnon
at the prison

22:33.686 --> 22:36.064
tried to line this up to make it
look like the original,

22:36.189 --> 22:38.483
but he had to reverse the print
to do it.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.403
"Yrev," the backwards word.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.406
What does this all mean?

22:45.531 --> 22:48.034
Tammy, you've been doing
excellent work,

22:48.159 --> 22:50.620
passing one test
after another.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.538
Put out your hands.

22:52.663 --> 22:53.956
Flip 'em over.

22:55.375 --> 22:59.587
"I'm very, very happy

22:59.712 --> 23:03.257
to see you again,

23:03.383 --> 23:05.927
old friend."

23:06.052 --> 23:09.013
This is the spiritual mound,
the spiritual finger.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.307
You think about that, Tammy.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.775
That's the only known
photograph we have of Cooper

23:20.900 --> 23:22.276
in the last 25 years.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.445
That's outside of Rio‒

23:24.570 --> 23:26.406
his house.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.949
By the time we checked it out,

23:28.074 --> 23:31.452
it belonged to some girl
from Ipanema.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.579
Looks like the man
we met in prison.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.458
The man we met in prison.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.436
Ten minutes.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.855
And I speak to him alone.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.690
Ten minutes, tops,

24:00.815 --> 24:02.650
or it's over
when I say it's over.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.819
That's exactly the way
it's gonna be, Diane.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.280
You'll control the curtain
and the microphone.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.365
And we're very appreciative.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.536
What'd you say
your name was, again?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.788
Tammy.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.457
Fuck you, Tammy.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.546
<i>I knew it was going
to be you.</i>

25:05.671 --> 25:09.175
<i>It's good
to see you again, Diane.</i>

25:11.219 --> 25:13.012
Oh, yeah?

25:13.137 --> 25:14.847
When was that, Cooper?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.726
When did we see
each other last?

25:21.604 --> 25:24.565
<i>Are you upset with me, Diane?</i>

25:27.527 --> 25:28.986
What do you think?

25:30.821 --> 25:33.533
<i>I think you're upset with me.</i>

25:39.038 --> 25:42.375
When was the last time
we saw each other, Cooper?

25:46.045 --> 25:49.215
<i>At your house.</i>

25:52.093 --> 25:53.386
That's right.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.682
Do you remember that night?

25:59.141 --> 26:01.686
<i>I'll always remember
that night.</i>

26:05.606 --> 26:07.233
Same for me.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.820
I'll never forget it.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.913
Who are you?

26:25.376 --> 26:28.129
<i>I don't know
what you mean, Diane.</i>

26:30.131 --> 26:31.674
Look at me.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.015
Look at me.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.349
Thank you, Warden Murphy.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.517
- That's it?
- Looks like it.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.020
Hold this man
till you hear from us.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.159
Diane?

27:44.121 --> 27:45.456
Listen to me.

27:46.874 --> 27:51.629
That is not the Dale Cooper
that I knew.

27:51.754 --> 27:55.174
Please tell me
exactly what you mean.

27:56.509 --> 28:00.012
It isn't time passing...

28:00.137 --> 28:03.099
or how he's changed...

28:03.224 --> 28:06.394
or the way he looks.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.190
It's something here.

28:13.651 --> 28:18.531
There's something
that definitely isn't here.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.494
That's good enough
for me, Diane.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.246
That's good enough for me.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.772
That last night
you mentioned in there‒

28:51.897 --> 28:53.566
something I need
to know about?

28:55.276 --> 28:57.611
You and I'll have a talk
sometime.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.322
You and I will have a talk.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.325
Okay?

29:03.451 --> 29:04.869
Okay.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.042
Cheers.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.794
To the FBI.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.575
Listen to me a minute.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.870
Tell Warden Murphy
I have a message for him.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.914
I need to speak with him
in his office.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.707
Yeah, right.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.501
Just tell him

29:53.626 --> 29:57.296
we need to speak
about a strawberry.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.216
Sit him down and leave.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.735
I've turned off
the security cameras.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.906
We can speak freely...

31:50.326 --> 31:52.244
...and privately.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.706
The dog leg.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.795
That dog had four legs.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.632
One you found in my trunk.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.052
The other three went out
with the information

32:08.177 --> 32:10.220
you're thinking about
right now.

32:11.639 --> 32:14.016
Two people you don't want
coming around here

32:14.141 --> 32:16.435
if anything bad
happens to me.

32:18.145 --> 32:22.316
How do I know
you know anything about...

32:22.441 --> 32:23.943
this?

32:26.987 --> 32:28.656
Joe McCluskey.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.968
What do you want?

32:50.636 --> 32:53.013
I want a car.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.516
Cheap rental, if you like.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.602
For myself and Ray Monroe.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.856
I want a friend
in the glove compartment.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.860
One a.m. tonight.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.405
Smooth and safe.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.409
And if your mind should wander
to a place

33:13.534 --> 33:17.204
where I might not make it
out of here alive,

33:17.329 --> 33:19.289
remember the dog legs.

33:22.126 --> 33:24.837
I'm not interested in you.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.006
You'll never see me again,

33:27.131 --> 33:29.425
and no one will ever
hear anything more

33:29.550 --> 33:32.219
about Joe McCluskey

33:32.344 --> 33:34.346
or your late Mr. Strawberry.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.754
Is there a reason you're
not talking to me, Dougie?

34:08.756 --> 34:10.174
Hmm?

34:30.110 --> 34:31.779
What were you and Bushnell
discussing earlier?

34:31.904 --> 34:32.988
I saw you...

34:34.198 --> 34:36.492
...walk into his office
carrying a bunch of files.

35:10.317 --> 35:13.987
Uh, some police officers
are here to see you, Dougie.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.865
Police.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.284
That reminds me of that call
I have to make.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.289
Police.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.092
You want them
to come in here?

35:35.217 --> 35:36.426
Okay.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.658
Mr. Jones?

36:01.410 --> 36:03.495
Detectives Fusco.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.540
Badge.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.168
What's going on here?

36:09.293 --> 36:10.377
Who are you, ma'am?

36:10.502 --> 36:12.713
I'm his wife.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.131
What's going on here?

36:14.256 --> 36:16.300
We're here about his car.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.135
That's why I'm here.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.180
What do you mean by that?

36:21.305 --> 36:23.056
I'm picking him up.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.559
He doesn't know
where his car is.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.060
Was it stolen?

36:28.145 --> 36:30.480
Dougie, was your car stolen?

36:33.025 --> 36:34.651
Stolen.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.906
Did you report it stolen, sir?

36:41.992 --> 36:43.994
Sir.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.663
Did you report your car
as a stolen vehicle?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.624
No, he did not
report it stolen.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.250
I would know.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.045
His car went missing.
We haven't seen it.

36:53.170 --> 36:54.755
Isn't that your department?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.925
Yes, it is,
once it's reported as missing.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.510
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.137
He doesn't know
where the car is.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.972
He hasn't seen it
in a few days,

37:04.097 --> 37:07.267
so, yes, there's
a very strong possibility

37:07.392 --> 37:08.977
that it was stolen.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.105
Stolen.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.401
All right, then, Mr. Jones,

37:16.526 --> 37:18.695
where did you last
leave your car?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.364
Well, if we knew that,

37:20.489 --> 37:22.366
we'd know where to find it,
wouldn't we?

37:22.491 --> 37:25.244
Okay, can you describe
your vehicle, please?

37:25.369 --> 37:27.955
Ah, it's a terrible car,
always in the shop‒

37:28.080 --> 37:31.792
silver, four-door,
cheap Ford,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.627
the kind they call
down at that dealer

37:33.752 --> 37:35.837
a "previously owned" car.

37:37.297 --> 37:40.759
When, uh, did the car
go missing?

37:44.054 --> 37:45.514
Dougie?

37:50.894 --> 37:52.646
Dougie.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.773
A few days ago.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.817
Few...

37:56.942 --> 37:58.485
days ago.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.029
Is there a reason why you
didn't report your car missing?

38:01.154 --> 38:03.573
Reason?
Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.409
There's more to life
than cars.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.828
Too many cars,
too much going on,

38:07.953 --> 38:10.163
and Dougie's been
under a lot of stress lately,

38:10.289 --> 38:13.083
and if you want to know
the truth, so have I.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.211
Officers,
have you found the car?

38:16.336 --> 38:17.421
Who are you, sir?

38:17.546 --> 38:19.464
He owns this place.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.216
Bushnell Mullins.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.884
Dougie works for me.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.139
You did find his car,
didn't you?

38:31.101 --> 38:33.562
The car has been found.

38:33.687 --> 38:36.648
It was involved
in an apparent explosion.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.025
Multiple fatalities.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.193
Why didn't you tell us that
to begin with?

38:40.319 --> 38:42.821
The deceased individuals
had ties to a gang

38:42.946 --> 38:45.365
associated
with multiple car thefts.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.326
Well, there's your answer.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.787
Now, if you don't mind,
our son's home alone

38:50.912 --> 38:52.748
waiting for his supper,
and in case you think

38:52.873 --> 38:54.791
we're neglecting him,
he's being watched

38:54.916 --> 38:57.127
by our neighbor as a favor,
and we'd like to go.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.837
We were supposed
to be home by now

38:58.962 --> 39:01.923
at the end of a very long
and stressful day,

39:02.049 --> 39:03.425
which I'll tell you about
later, Dougie.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.885
- Come on, let's go.
- Hold on.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.511
And I'm sure our being here

39:06.636 --> 39:08.638
hasn't made your day
any easier, ma'am,

39:08.764 --> 39:10.682
but we're gonna need you
to fill out some paperwork.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.935
Which we can take care of
at your convenience.

39:14.061 --> 39:17.314
Please, give us a call
in the morning.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.692
And, uh, thank you
for your cooperation.

39:20.817 --> 39:23.236
Have a pleasant evening.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.197
Evening.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.534
Well...

39:29.659 --> 39:30.994
I guess he won't have
any trouble

39:31.119 --> 39:32.329
collecting
the insurance, huh?

39:38.168 --> 39:40.128
I have some questions
about those files

39:40.253 --> 39:42.047
you covered for me, Dougie.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.467
But you go ahead.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.094
We can take care
of that tomorrow.

39:47.219 --> 39:48.762
Thanks, Mr. Mullins.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.726
Thank you...Mullins.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.107
So I met with them.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.150
I told them what the arrangements
were gonna be,

40:02.275 --> 40:03.985
and I gave them
more than they deserved,

40:04.111 --> 40:06.238
and that's the end
of them, okay?

40:06.363 --> 40:07.572
Now, with this car business,

40:07.697 --> 40:09.825
yes, there's gonna be
some insurance money.

40:09.950 --> 40:12.035
I don't know how much,
but, Dougie, just think.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.121
If you hadn't
blown that money gambling‒

40:14.246 --> 40:16.665
$25,000 plus the insurance‒

40:16.790 --> 40:19.000
we could have gotten you
a great new car.

40:19.126 --> 40:21.169
Now who knows what we'll get?

40:21.294 --> 40:23.088
But I do not want you
running off

40:23.213 --> 40:25.757
and gambling any more
of that jackpot.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.511
That money is for Sonny Jim
and our future.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.930
Just 'cause you have it now
doesn't mean you can just run off

40:32.055 --> 40:33.306
and risk one more penny.

40:33.432 --> 40:34.850
Do you hear me?

40:34.975 --> 40:36.351
No more gam‒

40:42.399 --> 40:43.233
Get off him!

40:45.861 --> 40:47.404
Squeeze his hand off.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.157
Squeeze his hand off.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.659
Squeeze his hand off.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.287
Dougie!

41:00.459 --> 41:01.877
Are you guys okay?

41:02.002 --> 41:03.628
Oh, my God.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.048
Are you okay?

41:07.174 --> 41:08.633
Oh, Dougie.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.015
What‒
Are you okay?

41:26.193 --> 41:27.903
And he just‒he just‒

41:28.028 --> 41:28.987
Dougie took right over,

41:29.112 --> 41:30.572
and he just chopped him
right in the throat

41:30.697 --> 41:32.449
and said, "You get off,"
and I kicked him,

41:32.574 --> 41:33.867
and I punched him,
and that was it,

41:33.992 --> 41:35.535
and‒and Dougie just
took care of business.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.620
Right, baby?

41:36.745 --> 41:38.580
It was‒it was terrible.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.123
What about the man with the gun?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.458
He ran right at me.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.335
Almost knocked me down.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.879
He smelled funny.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.756
Victim?
Oh, no.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.841
That guy didn't act
like any victim.

41:49.966 --> 41:52.177
Douglas Jones‒
he moved like a cobra.

41:52.302 --> 41:53.887
All I saw was a blur.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.291
When did you first
start hearing this?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.001
Sometime last week.

43:07.043 --> 43:10.046
But I think it's louder now.

43:10.171 --> 43:12.173
Maybe that's
'cause nobody's here.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.136
Don't move.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.971
Just listen carefully.

43:20.599 --> 43:23.810
Where do you think...

43:23.935 --> 43:25.270
it's coming from?

43:32.986 --> 43:34.279
Eh?

43:52.464 --> 43:53.840
Now‒now it sounds like

43:53.965 --> 43:55.884
it's coming
from over there, no?

43:56.009 --> 43:57.302
It sure does.

44:19.783 --> 44:20.867
No.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.662
No, it's not here either.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.040
Eh?

44:29.834 --> 44:32.504
Oh, this might be of interest.

44:32.629 --> 44:33.713
It came in the mail today.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.592
Wow. My God.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.511
That's an old one.

44:39.636 --> 44:42.847
We switched to cards
over 20 years ago.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.810
Room 315.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.231
Wait a minute.

44:53.149 --> 44:56.403
I think that was the room

44:56.528 --> 44:58.321
where Agent Cooper was shot.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.241
Who's Agent Cooper?

45:01.366 --> 45:03.493
FBI.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.830
He was here, I don't know,
maybe 25 years ago...

45:06.955 --> 45:10.709
investigating the murder
of Laura Palmer.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.380
Who's Laura Palmer?

45:17.674 --> 45:21.761
Oh, that, my dear...

45:21.886 --> 45:23.680
is a long story.

45:35.608 --> 45:37.277
Have maintenance, uh,

45:37.402 --> 45:39.195
check out that hum
in the morning.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.080
It's getting way past
quitting time.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.880
Thank you, Mr. Horne.

45:57.005 --> 45:57.839
Ben.

46:13.313 --> 46:14.606
Good night, Ben.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.609
Beverly.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.542
Hmm.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.739
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.032
How is he?

47:07.617 --> 47:09.786
We had kind of a rough day.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.287
He's better,

47:11.412 --> 47:15.124
but I had to give him
extra pain medication.

47:15.250 --> 47:17.377
Okay.
Thank you.

47:18.211 --> 47:19.838
Oh, has he eaten yet?

47:19.963 --> 47:22.465
He was waiting.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.551
- Dinner is on the stove.
- Okay.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.804
He's missing you.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.475
I'll see you tomorrow, Marge.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.615
Sorry I'm late, honey.

47:47.740 --> 47:48.575
Are you hungry?

47:54.914 --> 47:56.624
I heard you drive up.

48:04.090 --> 48:05.675
Why were you late?

48:07.385 --> 48:09.053
I had some things to do.

48:09.178 --> 48:10.597
Would you like your dinner?

48:15.476 --> 48:16.978
What things?

48:19.230 --> 48:20.440
I had some work to do.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.692
Some things came up,
and I needed to do them.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.617
Are you hungry?

48:39.959 --> 48:41.711
Not really.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.885
Listen to me, Tom.

48:49.010 --> 48:50.678
I know you're sick
and suffering.

48:50.803 --> 48:52.096
I know it.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.641
But do not use that
to fuck with me.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.393
Do not fuck with me!

48:57.518 --> 48:59.562
I didn't want
to go back to work.

48:59.687 --> 49:01.773
Do you know how goddamn lucky
I am to have this job

49:01.898 --> 49:03.733
to help us survive?

49:06.402 --> 49:09.614
Oh, for crying out loud,
do not fuck this up, Tom!

51:32.799 --> 51:34.133
Yeah, Roadhouse.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.260
Jean Michel.

51:36.385 --> 51:37.553
Uh-huh.

51:39.222 --> 51:42.350
Yeah, of course he loved it.
Who wouldn't?

51:42.475 --> 51:44.018
What?

51:44.143 --> 51:45.269
Two.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.482
I sent him two.
He owes me for two.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.484
What?
I don't know their names.

51:51.609 --> 51:55.363
Uh, he wanted blondes.
I sent him two blondes.

51:57.073 --> 51:59.826
What? Fuck, I‒
How old?

51:59.951 --> 52:02.245
They had IDs.
They both had good IDs.

52:02.370 --> 52:04.956
Look, this has nothing to do
with the Roadhouse.

52:05.081 --> 52:06.415
Roadhouse has been owned

52:06.541 --> 52:09.043
by the Renault family for‒
for 57 years.

52:09.168 --> 52:11.003
We're not gonna lose it now
because of a‒

52:11.129 --> 52:14.799
a couple of 15-year-old
straight-A students.

52:14.924 --> 52:15.967
No, no.

52:17.051 --> 52:20.513
Those girls, they are whores,

52:20.638 --> 52:22.473
pure and simple.

52:22.598 --> 52:27.311
Ah, from what I hear, though,
they were straight-A whores.

52:33.359 --> 52:35.153
He owes me for two.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.763
It's the beige rental.

54:27.265 --> 54:28.766
Here's your phone.

54:29.850 --> 54:31.602
Keys are in the car.

54:33.020 --> 54:34.438
You drive.

55:31.162 --> 55:32.538
Hey!

55:32.663 --> 55:33.831
Has anybody seen Billy?

55:33.956 --> 55:35.833
Nope. No.
