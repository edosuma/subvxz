FIVE, SIX, SHAKE IT, DUDE.

00:13.547 --> 00:21.455

00:35.303 --> 00:38.072
- * CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:38.106 --> 00:46.147

00:49.583 --> 00:53.454
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:43.837 --> 01:48.676

01:53.681 --> 01:57.918

02:17.205 --> 02:20.574

02:20.608 --> 02:24.178
- MARRIED?
MARRIED? OH, MY GOD!

02:24.212 --> 02:25.279
- YEAH, WE DID IT
IN TORONTO.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.514
- WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY LEGAL.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.282
- WE WISH YOU'D BEEN THERE
WITH US.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.717
- OH, US TOO.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.951
WELL, I'M GOING TO CRY ANYWAY.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.253
- WHEN WE GET BACK,

02:32.286 --> 02:33.254
WE'LL ALL GO OUT AND CELEBRATE.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.688
- THE TWO MARRIED COUPLES.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.257
CALL US IF THE BABY

02:36.290 --> 02:37.958
CROSSES THE FINISH LINE
BEFORE WE DO.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.593
- OY, VEY!
STOP WITH THE WORRYING.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.661
- SEE YOU IN A FEW DAYS.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.530
- AND CONGRATULATIONS.

02:42.563 --> 02:47.268
- OKAY, BYE.
- B-BYE...BYE.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.837
- MARRIED. LEGALLY.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.405
- AT LEAST IN CANADA.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.806
- SOMEDAY, HERE.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.542
- THAT'S WHEN GAY PEOPLE
WILL FIND OUT--

02:54.575 --> 02:56.210
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.978
IT MIGHT COME TRUE.
- THAT'S FOR SURE.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.680
WHAT MAKES THEM THINK THEY'LL
BE ANY BETTER AT IT

02:59.713 --> 03:01.449
THAN THOSE LONG-SUFFERING
STRAIGHT PEOPLE?

03:01.482 --> 03:02.950
- THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO'LL
PROFIT FROM IT

03:02.983 --> 03:04.618
ARE DIVORCE LAWYERS.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.554
THEY'LL HAVE A WHOLE NEW
CLIENTELE TO BILL.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.289
- I GUESS THAT'S
ONE GOOD THING ABOUT

03:08.322 --> 03:10.491
NOT BEING ALLOWED TO MARRY.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.327
- NOT HAVING TO GET A DIVORCE?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.200
- NEXT.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.340
- HOW LONG WERE YOU IN CANADA?
- TWO DAYS.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.775
- PURPOSE OF VISIT?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.777
- WE'RE DOING A BICYCLE RIDE
FOR CHARITY.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.845
- BOTH YOUR NAMES ARE ON THIS.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.981
- IT SAYS SPOUSES CAN USE
THE SAME FORM.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.518
- UM, WHILE WE WERE IN TORONTO,
OFFICER,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.453
WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT
THAT SAME-SEX MARRIAGES

03:39.487 --> 03:41.855
ARE LEGAL.
- SO WE TIED THE KNOT.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.991
THEY'RE HUSBAND AND HUSBAND.

03:44.024 --> 03:49.863
- WHO'S HE?
both: OUR SON.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.032
- YOU KNOW, THIS MAY BE LEGAL
IN CANADA,

03:52.065 --> 03:53.667
BUT THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA

03:53.701 --> 03:55.403
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE GAY
MARRIAGES.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.737
- OH, COME ON, OFFICER,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.472
THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE
OF CRAZY KIDS

03:58.506 --> 04:01.542
WHO FELL IN LOVE AND GOT
HITCHED--GIVE 'EM A BREAK.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.277
- IF YOU WANT TO ENTER
THE COUNTRY,

04:03.311 --> 04:04.545
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FILL
OUT TWO SEPARATE FORMS,

04:04.578 --> 04:06.980
AS SINGLE INDIVIDUALS.
NEXT!

04:13.954 --> 04:15.623
- DID YOU BRING ANY FRUIT
INTO THE COUNTRY?

04:15.656 --> 04:19.393
- 250 OF THEM, ON BICYCLES.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.061
- THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT
TO CANADA WAS

04:21.094 --> 04:24.532
"TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST JOY
I'VE EVER KNOWN

04:24.565 --> 04:26.834
SEEING MY GAY SON MARRY
HIS LOVER."

04:26.867 --> 04:29.036
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, BUTZ?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.571
- MA.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.073
- AS I EXPLAINED TO YOUR SON,

04:33.106 --> 04:34.642
THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

04:34.675 --> 04:37.044
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE GAYS
GETTING MARRIED.

04:37.077 --> 04:41.382
- BUT YOU DO RECOGNIZE
BRITNEY SPEARS

04:41.415 --> 04:42.916
GETTING LOADED AND MARRIED
ONE NIGHT,

04:42.950 --> 04:45.853
AND HAVING IT ANNULLED
THE NEXT MORNING.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.655
OR TWO TOTAL STRANGERS
GETTING MARRIED

04:47.688 --> 04:50.558
FOR A MILLION FUCKIN' BUCKS
ON TELEVISION.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.526
IS THAT THE SANCTITY
OF MARRIAGE

04:52.560 --> 04:54.061
THAT YOU ASSHOLES ARE
PROTECTING?

04:54.094 --> 04:55.929
- MA!
- WELL, WHAT IS THIS SHIT--

04:55.963 --> 04:58.098
NOT LETTING YOU BACK
IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.968
LIKE YOUR MARRIAGE DOESN'T
COUNT?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.570
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR CANADA

05:02.603 --> 05:03.671
AND THE QUEEN OF
FUCKIN' ENGLAND,

05:03.704 --> 05:08.409
THEN IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR BUTZ.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.579
- MA'AM?

05:11.612 --> 05:14.081
DO YOU LIKE SMOKED SALMON?

05:14.114 --> 05:16.750
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.686
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP,

05:18.719 --> 05:21.489
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE IN NOVA SCOTIA.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.424
NEXT.

05:23.457 --> 05:28.429
- I HAD THESE MOCKED UP
JUST TO GET A FEEL.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.964
- HUH. IT FEELS UNREAL.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.966
- FOR NOW, BUT NOT FOR LONG.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.570
I ALSO ASKED A PRODUCTION
DESIGNER I HAVE IN MIND

05:36.604 --> 05:39.106
TO DO A RENDERING
OF RAGE'S LAIR.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.576
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:42.610 --> 05:46.447
- UH...
IT'S GOOD.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.582
- IT NEEDS TO BE DARKER.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.718
NOT DARK SCARY, BUT DARK SEXY.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.587
A PLACE YOU DREAM
OF GETTING FUCKED IN.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.489
AND HIS BED SHOULD BE
MORE CENTER,

05:55.523 --> 05:57.458
AND RAISED, LIKE AN ALTAR.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.060
SINCE RAGE'S SEXUAL ENERGY IS
WHAT MOTIVATES THE CHARACTER

06:00.093 --> 06:01.629
AND DRIVES THE ACTION.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.464
- I COULDN'T HAVE PUT IT BETTER
MYSELF.

06:03.497 --> 06:09.470
[intercom beeps]
- BRETT, MARTY'S ON THE LINE.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.671
- HI, MARTY.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.007
YEAH, IT WAS A GOOD MEETING.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.143
THAT'S WHY I WANTED YOU
TO MEET HIM.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.611
UH-HUH.

06:17.645 --> 06:21.081
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

06:21.114 --> 06:26.754
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.656
WE GOT THE GREEN LIGHT.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.024
- THAT'S AWESOME.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.526
- YOU WERE AWESOME.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.827
YOU SHOWED EVERYONE
IN THAT MEETING

06:33.861 --> 06:36.163
THE ONE THING HOLLYWOOD FEARS
MOST.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.966
- BAD HAIR?
- HONESTY.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.102
- I WAS JUST SPEAKING MY MIND.
- SAY, YOU HUNGRY?

06:42.135 --> 06:44.104
GETTING A GO ALWAYS
MAKES ME FAMISHED.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.941
BLAIR, GET ME A TABLE AT SPAGO.
- YOU GOT IT.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.711
- IF YOU'RE LUCKY, WE MAY HAVE
A NANCY REAGAN SIGHTING

06:50.744 --> 06:53.714
- OH, AND, CANCEL MR. TAYLOR'S
FLIGHT.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.517
HE'LL BE STAYING UNTIL TOMORROW.
- WHAT FOR?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.552
- YOU JUST GOT A PICTURE
PICKED UP.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.822
YOU CAN'T LEAVE TOWN
WITHOUT CELEBRATING.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.731
- THIS SEAT TAKEN?

07:10.764 --> 07:13.567
OH, GOD. MY ACHING TUSH.

07:13.601 --> 07:17.538
IT'S BEEN GIVEN A WORKOUT
BEFORE, BUT NEVER LIKE THIS.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.207
HOW'S YOURS?
- IT'S FINE.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.110
- WELL, HOW ARE YOUR MEAT BALLS?
- THEY'RE BOTH FINE.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.880
- WELL, SOMETHING'S NOT FINE.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.582
- TOMORROW'S MY BIRTHDAY.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.950
- UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN REBORN,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.218
YOUR BIRTHDAY'S IN AUGUST.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.555
- MY 12-STEP BIRTHDAY.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.490
IT'LL BE SIX MONTHS SINCE
I'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.593
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.095
JUST TRYING TO KEEP THINGS GAY.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.032
- I DON'T FEEL VERY GAY
RIGHT NOW.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.100
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.569
IT'S THE LONGEST I'VE GONE
WITHOUT A MEETING

07:48.602 --> 07:50.838
SINCE GETTING OUT OF REHAB,
AND...

07:50.871 --> 07:55.843
I AM FEELING NERVOUS,
ANXIOUS...

07:55.876 --> 08:00.581
LOST.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.882
- THERE YOU GO, HONEY.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.818
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
IF YOU WANT SECONDS.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.730
- WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND EAT SOMETHING?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.866
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.
- COME ON, MA,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.934
YOU NEED TO KEEP UP
YOUR STRENGTH TOO.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.871
- GODDAMN BORDER GUARD
NOT LETTING YOU IN!

08:23.904 --> 08:26.306
HE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE LAW.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.809
MARRIAGE DOESN'T EXIST.
AT LEAST, NOT FOR US, NOT HERE.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.745
- BUT IT WILL. ONCE THE SNOWBALL
STARTS ROLLING,

08:31.779 --> 08:34.748
THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT.
- THIS WAY.

08:34.782 --> 08:38.151
RIGHT OVER HERE.
- WHAT?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.754
OH, MY GOD!

08:40.788 --> 08:44.191
- WELL?
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.326
- WELL, YOU'VE BEEN TO ENOUGH
HETEROSEXUAL SUICIDE PACTS

08:46.359 --> 08:49.096
TO KNOW--
THIS IS A WEDDING CAKE.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.164
[Debbie laughs]

08:51.198 --> 08:53.934
- IT'S FOR YOUR RECEPTION.
- I MEAN WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.235
- AND IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.837
- WE'RE BACK IN THE U.S. OF A.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.741
FOR ENOUGH MONEY,
YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING.

09:00.774 --> 09:05.078
- AND HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO WASH IT DOWN WITH.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.314
- THAT STUFF COSTS A FORTUNE.
- I'LL POUR.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.816
- AH, THE FUCK YOU WILL.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.183
- YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I EVER EXPECTED

09:10.217 --> 09:12.953
TO BE CELEBRATING A MARRIAGE.
- OH, NO.

09:12.986 --> 09:17.725
[cork pops, all cheer]

09:17.758 --> 09:20.193
- TO THE NOVOTNY-BRUCKNERS.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.195
[cheers and applause]

09:22.229 --> 09:25.666
LONG MAY IT WAVE.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.602
[celebratory music]

09:28.636 --> 09:31.238
*

09:31.271 --> 09:32.606
- A KLEZMER BAND?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.107
- WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING,

09:34.141 --> 09:36.977
TOMMY DORSEY?
GET UP.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.879
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

09:38.912 --> 09:49.823
*

09:49.857 --> 09:53.694
[cheering, laughter]

09:53.727 --> 10:01.669
*

10:06.206 --> 10:07.607
- COME ON, MOM.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.127
- WHERE WILL YOU GO?

10:27.160 --> 10:30.931
- I'LL FIND AN APARTMENT.
- THANKS.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.133
HOPEFULLY, NEAR GUS'S SCHOOL.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.735
WE DON'T WANT TO PULL HIM OUT.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.037
IT'LL BE TRAUMATIC ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.073
- FOR ALL OF US.
- MM.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.675
GOD, THESE ARE GOOD.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.277
- BAKING'S VERY THERAPEUTIC.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.213
- CHOCOLATE-CHIP THERAPY--

10:46.246 --> 10:48.015
IT COULD PUT EVERY SHRINK
OUT OF BUSINESS.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.951
- I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD KEEP
ALL THE ACCOUNTS THE SAME,

10:50.984 --> 10:53.053
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.755
NO NEED TO THROW EVERYTHING
INTO CHAOS.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.223
- I AGREE.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.058
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.360
- TO THE BATHROOM,
FOR THE 10,000TH TIME TODAY.

11:00.393 --> 11:04.097
- OH, YES.
I REMEMBER IT WELL.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.968
- I'LL GO GIVE GUS HIS BATH.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.104
- HOW DO WE EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS
TO HIM?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.243
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.211
I GUESS WE WAIT 15 YEARS,

11:18.245 --> 11:20.380
AND HE'LL TELL US THE REASON
HE'S SO SCREWED UP

11:20.413 --> 11:23.984
IS BECAUSE OF HIS CRAZY
MOTHERS.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.919
HEY, I--I'LL DO THAT.

11:25.953 --> 11:29.122
- AS LONG AS I'M UP,
I'LL GET IT.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.799
[glass shatters]

11:38.832 --> 11:41.201
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.502
- MIND NOT RUBBING IT IN?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.805
- WHO'S RUBBING IT IN?
CHECK IT OUT.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.140
- SEEMS, UH, BRAD--
YOU KNOW, MISTER HUNKY

11:47.174 --> 11:48.475
WITH THE BROAD SHOULDERS
AND BIG ARMS

11:48.508 --> 11:49.843
WHO HAULS OUR
TENTS AROUND?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.845
HE'S FROM THESE PARTS,

11:51.879 --> 11:54.815
AND HE SAYS WE'RE NOT TOO FAR
FROM THIS TOWN...

11:54.848 --> 11:56.216
LITTLE HOPE. SEE?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.218
- WHERE?
- THERE.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.220
- THAT'S A SMUDGE.
- IT'S A TOWN.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.090
AND THEY HAVE A 12-STEP MEETING
EVERY DAY

12:03.123 --> 12:04.491
AT THE FIRST METHODIST CHURCH.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.259
ALTHOUGH IT'S SUCH
A SMALL TOWN,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.895
PROBABLY JUST DO A 2-STEP.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.496
- A LOT OF GOOD THAT DOES ME.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.764
IT'S NOT EVEN ON OUR ROUTE.

12:10.798 --> 12:14.868
- NO, BUT IF WE VEER OFF HERE,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.137
RIDE TO LITTLE HOPE THERE,

12:17.170 --> 12:24.244
WE COULD TAKE THIS ROAD BACK
AND REJOIN THE GROUP, ICI. HMM?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.446
- WELL, IT'S NOT A TOTALLY
IDIOTIC IDEA.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.850
- THANKS.
- I DIDN'T MEAN--

12:29.883 --> 12:32.119
THANKS, EM.
REALLY.

12:32.152 --> 12:36.189
- SEE? TOLD YOU I'D BE HERE
FOR YOU, DIDN'T I?

12:41.428 --> 12:44.865
- HEY, SPORT. HOW YOU DOING?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.000
- NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT
SECOND PIECE OF WEDDING CAKE.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.468
[groans]

12:48.501 --> 12:51.071
- BUT WHEN THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE
MARRIES SOMEBODY ELSE,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.439
WHAT CHOICE DO YOU HAVE

12:52.472 --> 12:55.075
BUT TO DROWN YOURSELF
IN BUTTER CREAM FILLING?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.877
YOU'LL BURN IT OFF IN NO TIME.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.546
'CAUSE I'M THE MAN!
- YOU ARE, DUDE.

12:59.579 --> 13:04.017
- FUCK THE DOCTORS.
AND FUCK THE NAY-SAYERS.

13:04.051 --> 13:08.488
I'M STILL YOUNG,
I'M STILL GUH-GUH-GOR-JUSS.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.125
I'M STILL HOT.
- YOU KNOW IT.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.898
- LOOK, MIKEY,

13:17.931 --> 13:22.435
NO HANDS.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.905
OH!
[groaning]

13:24.938 --> 13:27.507
- OH, JESUS CHRIST.
- OH, MY GOD!

13:27.540 --> 13:29.109
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:29.142 --> 13:32.079
- ARE YOU HURT?
- CAREFUL, CAREFUL. BRIAN?

13:32.112 --> 13:35.815
- BRIAN, CAN YOU GET UP?
- [groaning]

13:40.120 --> 13:43.456
- WELL, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR CLAVICLE.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.958
[Brian groans]

13:44.992 --> 13:47.094
- AND IT HURTS
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.062
- THAT'LL TEACH YOU
TO CRUISE GUYS NO-HANDED.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.331
- THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S A CLEAN BREAK,

13:51.364 --> 13:53.000
SO IT'LL MEND WELL.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.068
- DID I MENTION THAT IT HURTS
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.469
IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR
A CAST?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.504
BECAUSE OF WHERE HE INJURED
HIMSELF,

13:57.537 --> 13:58.605
ALL WE CAN DO IS WRAP IT.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.873
- I'M SURE I MENTIONED

13:59.907 --> 14:01.141
IT HURTS
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.275
- WE WILL GIVE YOU
SOME VICODIN.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.945
- AH, HEAR THAT?
JUST LIKE BABYLON.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.479
- AND THEN WE'LL SEND YOU HOME.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.148
- EXCUSE ME?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.250
- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU IN
FOR SOME X-RAYS,

14:10.283 --> 14:14.654
AND THEN WE'LL FIND A VOLUNTEER
TO DRIVE YOU BACK TO PITTSBURGH.

14:14.687 --> 14:23.263
SORRY, BUDDY. RIDE'S OVER.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.534
- OH, GOD. I'M SCARED, LINZ.
THIS IS ALL SO WEIRD.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.102
- I KNOW. I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.004
HOW MANY HUSBANDS CAN
SAY THAT TO THEIR WIVES?

14:31.038 --> 14:34.041
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE
RIGHT BACK FOR YOU, HON.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.310
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.247
- I REMEMBER FEELING SO LEFT OUT
WHEN YOU HAD GUS.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.448
- AREN'T YOU GRATEFUL
YOU'RE GETTING

14:41.481 --> 14:43.316
TO EXPERIENCE THIS YOURSELF?
- NO!

14:43.350 --> 14:44.985
I WANT THEM TO KNOCK ME OUT.

14:45.018 --> 14:49.656
WAKE ME UP WHEN THIS FUCKING
THING'S OVER.

14:49.689 --> 14:54.261
DON'T LEAVE. STAY.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.463
GET ME THROUGH THIS.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.999
- AND GIVE UP
MY THEATRE TICKETS?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.701
- YEAH.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.372
- OKAY, THE ROOM'S ALL READY
FOR YOU.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.490
OKAY, JUST TAKE IT EASY.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.959
OKAY?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.028
- [gasps]

15:28.061 --> 15:31.298
OOH!

15:31.331 --> 15:33.233
THAT WAS A BITCH
OF A CONTRACTION.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.302
- NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT WE LEARNED AT LAMAZE?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.104
- OH. BARELY.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.373
- IT'LL COME BACK TO YOU.
HERE'S YOUR FOCAL POINT.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.575
NOW START YOUR BREATHING.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.311
[inhaling, exhaling slowly]

15:44.344 --> 15:49.983
- ONE...
- [pained groan]

15:50.017 --> 15:54.721
- TWO...

15:54.754 --> 15:57.590
THREE. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE WAY.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.192
KEEP GOING.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.095
[inhaling, exhaling slowly]

16:07.367 --> 16:10.603
- THE PARAMEDIC SAID THERE'S
NO WAY HE CAN FINISH.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.772
- THAT SUCKS THE HAIRY WANG.
- NOW WHAT?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.342
- SOME VOLUNTEER'S GOT TO
DRIVE HIM HOME.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.145
- POOR GUY. HE WORKED SO HARD.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.214
I'M GOING TO GO SET THE TABLE
FOR 250.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.216
- WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

16:23.250 --> 16:26.419
- UH, RACK OF LAMB
WITH PORCINI RISOTTO,

16:26.453 --> 16:29.222
OR LOBSTER IN TRUFFLE SAUCE,

16:29.256 --> 16:30.623
AND CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE
FOR DESSERT.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.125
- REALLY?

16:32.159 --> 16:35.262
- OKAY. CHOPPED BEEF
AND TUNA SURPRISE.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.764
PERSONALLY, I DON'T CARE
FOR SURPRISES.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.499
- TED AND EMMETT BETTER GET BACK
FROM THEIR SIGHTSEEING

16:39.532 --> 16:42.669
EXCURSION
OR THEY'RE GOING TO MISS IT.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.140
- EXCUSE ME.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.776
PARDON ME, MISTER.

16:49.809 --> 16:53.113
- ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

16:53.146 --> 16:56.649
- YOU'RE IN SEVERE PAIN.
YOU SHOULD BE RESTING.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.385
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.720
- PRACTICING RIDING ONE-HANDED.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.656
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY--
YES, I AM, SERIOUSLY.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.558
- BUT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY INJURED.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.660
- COULD WE STOP USING THE WORD
"SERIOUSLY"?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.196
- THEY'RE SENDING SOMEONE
TO TAKE YOU BACK.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.797
- I'M NOT GOING.
- YES YOU ARE.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.132
THE PARAMEDIC TOLD YOU--

17:12.165 --> 17:13.700
- FUCK WHAT THE PARAMEDIC
TOLD ME!

17:13.733 --> 17:15.602
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN BICYCLE
ALL THE WAY BACK TO--

17:15.635 --> 17:20.039
- AND STOP TELLING ME
WHAT I FUCKING CAN'T DO.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.754
SEE YOU ON THE ROAD.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.532
- HEY BRETT. GO AHEAD.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.376
- HEY, BRETT.
NICE TO SEE YOU, MAN.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.478
- THIS PLACE SEEMS PRETTY
EXCLUSIVE.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.113
- NAH, THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.

18:00.147 --> 18:04.717
RICH PEOPLE. GORGEOUS PEOPLE.
FAMOUS PEOPLE.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.387
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'LL FEEL
AT HOME HERE IN NO TIME.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.456
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH GOING
BACK TO PITTSBURGH AFTER THIS.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.659
- HEY, BRETT.
- THEN WHY GO? STAY HERE.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.327
WORK IN THE MOVIES.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.197
ISN'T THAT EVERYONE'S DREAM?
IT WAS MINE.

18:17.230 --> 18:22.202
- AND DO WHAT?
ASSISTANT ART DIRECTOR ON RAGE.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.371
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'VE GOT TALENT,

18:24.404 --> 18:27.274
PASSION, AMBITION,
AND, IF I MAY ADD,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.376
THE BACKING OF AN A-LIST
DIRECTOR.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.744
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.680
- HOW LONG WOULD I BE HERE FOR?

18:33.713 --> 18:36.216
- SIX, EIGHT MONTHS,
DEPENDING ON THE SCHEDULE.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.718
- BRETTSKI!
- HEY, CON.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.623
YOU, UH, REMEMBER JUSTIN?
- OF COURSE.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.258
- THE MAN WHO MAKES RAGE FLY.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.360
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.262
- FENDERMAN GAVE US
THE GREEN LIGHT.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.930
- AWESOME. CONGRATS.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.433
- A SCRIPT'S COMING YOUR WAY,
SO KEEP GOING TO THE GYM.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.235
THOSE TIGHTS SHOW NO MERCY.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.270
- COME ON, I'LL BUY YOU
GUYS A DRINK TO CELEBRATE.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.571
THEN MAYBE WE CAN
GO BACK TO MY PLACE.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.507
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT THERE ARE SOME FACES

19:00.540 --> 19:02.309
I WANT TO FLAUNT THE NEWS IN.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.812
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO?

19:10.283 --> 19:14.287
[owl hooting]

19:18.291 --> 19:20.260
[cow mooing]

19:20.293 --> 19:21.328
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN A LEFT

19:21.361 --> 19:24.264
AT THIS LITTLE SQUIGGLE HERE.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.266
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW HOW
TO READ A MAP.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.800
OF COURSE I KNOW HOW TO READ
A MAP.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.803
YOU GO DOWN THIS ROAD,
MAKE A LEFT AT "UP YOURS,"

19:30.837 --> 19:33.206
THEN CONTINUE ON ABOUT THREE
MILES TO "GO FUCK YOURSELF."

19:33.240 --> 19:34.941
[cow moos]

19:34.974 --> 19:38.678
- [breathing heavily]

19:38.711 --> 19:41.681
- TEDDY, WHAT IS IT?

19:41.714 --> 19:45.418
- IT'S DARK, WE'RE LOST,

19:45.452 --> 19:46.986
I'M NEVER MAKING IT
TO THAT MEETING,

19:47.019 --> 19:50.757
I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK...

19:50.790 --> 19:53.893
AND WHY DID I LISTEN TO YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.995
- JUST TRYING TO HELP.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.431
- WELL, YOU'RE ONLY
MAKING THINGS WORSE.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.933
[Teddy hyperventilating]

20:08.941 --> 20:12.712
- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING,
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

20:12.745 --> 20:16.316
[cow moos]
- WITH WHAT? LIVESTOCK?

20:16.349 --> 20:18.651
IT ONLY TAKES TWO PEOPLE
TO HAVE A MEETING, RIGHT?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.487
ONE TO TALK, ONE TO LISTEN.
[clears throat]

20:20.520 --> 20:26.593
UH, THIS MEETING
WILL NOW COME TO ORDER.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.462
NOW WHAT?
- WELL, SINCE IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.364
SOMEONE NEEDS TO INTRODUCE ME.

20:31.398 --> 20:35.268
- WELL, GUESS THAT WOULD BE ME.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.870
UH...[clears throat]
ATTENTION, EVERYONE.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.606
WE HAVE A BIRTHDAY TONIGHT.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.875
THAT'S RIGHT.
SIX MONTHS, CLEAN AND SOBER.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.277
YOU KNOW HIM. YOU LOVE HIM.

20:44.311 --> 20:50.417
THE ONE, THE ONLY,
TED SCHMIDT!

20:50.450 --> 20:52.485
HOW WAS THAT?

20:52.519 --> 20:55.422
- PERFECT, IF I WAS APPEARING
AT THE COPACABANA.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.891
AND WE ONLY USE FIRST NAMES.
IT'S ANONYMOUS.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.794
- OH, SORRY, TED.

21:01.828 --> 21:07.767
- GO ON. GET UP THERE.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.304
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.447
[cow moos]

21:20.480 --> 21:23.049
HI. I'M TED

21:23.082 --> 21:28.087
I'M A SUBSTANCE ABUSER.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.457
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY,
"HI, TED."

21:30.490 --> 21:32.659
- OH, RIGHT. HI, TED.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.961
NOW WHAT?

21:34.994 --> 21:38.998
WELL, NOW I TELL EVERYONE,
OR IN THIS CASE, ONE,

21:39.031 --> 21:43.670
THAT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,
AND THEN THEY BRING ME A CAKE.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.539
- CAKE. CAKE.

21:46.573 --> 21:50.543
OH... [humming]

21:50.577 --> 21:54.714
HOW'S THIS?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.818
WHAT NEXT?

21:58.851 --> 22:04.023
- THEN I SHARE.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.093
SIX MONTHS AGO, MY LIFE WAS
OUT OF CONTROL.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.828
I WAS LOST.

22:08.861 --> 22:12.131
BUT NOW, THANKS TO BILL W.,

22:12.164 --> 22:18.605
THE GOOD LORD,
AND THE PROGRAM...

22:18.638 --> 22:24.043
MY LIFE HAS TURNED AROUND.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.847
I NOW HAVE FAITH.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.584
I HAVE PURPOSE.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.721
BUT MOST OF ALL...

22:34.754 --> 22:40.126
I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS...

22:40.159 --> 22:43.463
WHO'VE STOOD BY ME...

22:43.496 --> 22:46.899
AND HELPED LEAD ME DOWN
THE RIGHT ROAD.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.135
THANK GOD THEY DIDN'T NEED
A MAP TO DO IT.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.671
[both chuckle]

22:51.704 --> 22:53.873
[cow moos]

22:53.906 --> 22:56.008
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.144
THANK YOU, LADIES.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.913
AND THEN WE CUT THE CAKE.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.758
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TEDDY.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.461
- THANKS, EM.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.670
[animal howls]

23:26.105 --> 23:29.509
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

23:29.542 --> 23:33.079
- NOW IS WHEN WE USUALLY GO OUT
FOR COFFEE.

23:41.588 --> 23:45.525
- * THE ROAD HAS BEEN LONGER

23:45.558 --> 23:49.729
* THAN I EVER THOUGHT

23:49.762 --> 23:54.000
* AND THE COST OF LIVING

23:54.033 --> 23:56.235
* HAS COST ME A LOT

23:56.268 --> 23:58.004
*

23:58.037 --> 24:02.809
* THIS TIME LAST YEAR

24:02.842 --> 24:06.746
* I NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D BE RIGHT HERE *

24:06.779 --> 24:11.250
* THIS TIME LAST YEAR

24:11.283 --> 24:15.688
* I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D BE
RIGHT HERE *

24:15.722 --> 24:19.025
* OPEN UP THE SKIES

24:19.058 --> 24:23.963
* LET THE SUN SHINE
ON MY SOUL *

24:23.996 --> 24:30.703
* OPEN UP THIS MIND
TO THE TELOS OF MY GOAL *

24:30.737 --> 24:34.040
* OPEN UP THE SKIES

24:34.073 --> 24:39.579
* FOR THE ROAD IS THE REASON
AGAIN *

24:39.612 --> 24:42.181
* OPEN UP THE SKIES

24:42.214 --> 24:47.920
* FOR THE ROAD IS THE REASON
AGAIN *

24:47.954 --> 24:55.595
* I CAN SEE THINGS
THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE *

24:55.628 --> 24:58.598
* FOR THE ROAD IS THE REASON
AGAIN *

24:58.631 --> 25:05.204
*

25:05.237 --> 25:08.007
* I SEE YOU

25:08.040 --> 25:12.679
* I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WERE *

25:12.712 --> 25:17.216
* MAYBE YOU WERE THERE
ALL ALONG *

25:17.249 --> 25:21.287
* BUT I COULDN'T SEE

25:21.320 --> 25:25.057
* NOW HERE WE ARE

25:25.091 --> 25:30.029
* TOGETHER ON THIS ROAD

25:30.062 --> 25:35.668
* TAKING THE PATH
TO FINAL VICTORY *

25:35.702 --> 25:38.237
*

25:38.270 --> 25:41.340
* OPEN UP THE SKIES

25:41.373 --> 25:44.777
- THAT'S IT,
I'M CALLING FOR HELP.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.914
- THE FUCK YOU ARE.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.916
WOULD YOU JUST GO ON AND RIDE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND?

25:49.949 --> 25:52.251
- AND LEAVE YOU ALONE?

25:52.284 --> 25:56.122
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

25:56.155 --> 26:00.126
I'M STAYING HERE WITH YOU.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.663
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.331
TO SHOW EVERYONE WHAT A HERO
YOU ARE?

26:05.364 --> 26:07.099
THAT DESPITE INSURMOUNTABLE
ODDS,

26:07.133 --> 26:10.136
THE GREAT KINNEY CAN CROSS
THE FINISH LINE

26:10.169 --> 26:12.204
WITH ONE ARM TIED
BEHIND HIS BACK?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.874
- IN FRONT OF MY BACK.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.343
- IN FRONT OF YOUR BACK.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.812
THERE'S NO NEED TO--YOU'VE
ALREADY PROVED YOURSELF.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.815
YOU'VE RAISED $100,000
FOR THE HOSPICE.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.885
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO DO?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.386
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.288
- THEN WHAT'S IT ABOUT,
KILLING YOURSELF?

26:29.321 --> 26:31.991
- WOULD YOU FUCK OFF?

26:32.024 --> 26:34.994
I CAN DO IT.

26:39.866 --> 26:43.636
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT STORY
ON TV ABOUT THOSE WOMEN...

26:43.670 --> 26:44.771
THAT HAD CANCER?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.939
[lighter won't light]

26:49.275 --> 26:55.047
ANYWAY, THEY ALL HAD CANCER.

26:55.081 --> 27:00.152
SO WHAT DO THEY DO?
THEY GO TO THIS BOOT CAMP...

27:00.186 --> 27:01.721
WHERE THEY HAVE TO CLIMB
OVER WALLS

27:01.754 --> 27:03.723
AND CRAWL THROUGH THE MUD--

27:03.756 --> 27:05.391
SWING OVER THESE
BOTTOMLESS PITS

27:05.424 --> 27:10.997
WHILE THIS FORMER LUFTWAFFE
DRILL SERGEANT TERRORIZES THEM.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.432
AND I'M WATCHING THIS
AND I'M THINKING,

27:13.465 --> 27:15.735
"CHRIST! DON'T THESE CRAZY
BITCHES HAVE

27:15.768 --> 27:20.673
ENOUGH SHIT TO DEAL WITH?"

27:20.707 --> 27:23.275
THEN ONE OF THEM COMES OUT
OF THIS SWAMP

27:23.309 --> 27:24.744
THAT'S FULL OF FUCKING
CROCODILES

27:24.777 --> 27:28.681
OR SHARKS OR SOMETHING.

27:28.715 --> 27:32.451
AND SHE'S LAUGHING.

27:32.484 --> 27:38.357
LAUGHING.

27:38.390 --> 27:43.195
AND SHE SAYS...

27:43.229 --> 27:47.834
"IF I CAN SURVIVE THIS,
I CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING."

27:59.145 --> 28:01.914
- COME ON.

28:08.821 --> 28:11.157
- [groans]

28:22.902 --> 28:24.971
[groans]

28:45.291 --> 28:47.093
- COFFEE?

28:47.126 --> 28:49.361
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE UP.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.097
I'VE ALREADY WORKED OUT
WITH MY TRAINER,

28:51.130 --> 28:52.298
MADE 10 CALLS TO NEW YORK,

28:52.331 --> 28:54.967
READ 2 SCRIPTS AND THE TRADES.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.136
HAVE A ROLL FROM CAMPANILE.

28:57.169 --> 29:01.107
BEST BREAD ON THE PLANET.
FUCK THE CARBS.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.242
SO HOW WAS YOUR EVENING?

29:03.275 --> 29:06.045
CONNOR TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU?

29:06.078 --> 29:09.548
- YEAH, HE'S A COOL GUY.
- AND HOT.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.518
DOES BRIAN KNOW ABOUT YOUR
EXTRA-MARITAL ACTIVITIES?

29:12.551 --> 29:16.322
- WE'RE NOT MARRIED.
BRIAN DETESTS MARRIAGE.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.924
- WELL, THAT'S A UNIQUE POSITION
TO TAKE

29:17.957 --> 29:20.392
WHEN EVERY FAG ON EARTH WANTS
TO SAY "I DO."

29:20.426 --> 29:22.528
YEAH, WELL, WE'D RATHER SAY
"I DON'T."

29:22.561 --> 29:24.396
THAT WAY WE CAN BE TOGETHER
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE,

29:24.430 --> 29:26.065
NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.135
HOW VERY "RAGE-IAN."

29:29.168 --> 29:31.871
YOU BETTER GO CLEAN UP
AND PACK.

29:31.904 --> 29:35.041
THERE'LL BE A CAR HERE IN AN
HOUR TO TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.546
- BY THE WAY,

29:40.579 --> 29:42.414
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR OFFER.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.884
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.552
- BUT...

29:46.585 --> 29:50.957
THERE IS NO "BUT."
I WANT TO DO IT.

29:50.990 --> 29:54.360
SO I'M COMING BACK.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.099
- MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.201
THAT'S THE LUMPIEST GROUND
I EVER SLEPT ON.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.569
YOU WEREN'T SLEEPING
ON THE GROUND,

30:03.602 --> 30:05.171
YOU WERE SLEEPING ON ME.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.438
SO I END UP BEING YOUR SUPPORT

30:06.472 --> 30:08.307
WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MINE.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.575
- LOOK, I WOKE UP
WITHOUT ANY COFFEE,

30:09.608 --> 30:11.243
AND WORSE, I'M OUT
OF BREATH MINTS.

30:11.277 --> 30:15.948
SO WOULD YOU KINDLY SPARE ME
YOUR MORNING SARCASM?

30:15.982 --> 30:18.450
SORRY, TEDDY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.186
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR
SUPPORT SYSTEM,

30:20.219 --> 30:23.389
AND HERE I AM PULLING THE
PROPS OUT FROM UNDER YOU.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.457
YOU GO AHEAD,
MAKE ALL THE SARCASTIC,

30:25.491 --> 30:28.127
INSENSITIVE REMARKS YOU WANT.
- I'M SORRY TOO, EM.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.263
YOU'VE BEEN A WONDERFUL
SUPPORT.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.066
BUT IF IT TURNS OUT WE'RE
HOPELESSLY LOST,

30:34.100 --> 30:37.603
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON
I DON'T SURVIVE THE ELEMENTS,

30:37.636 --> 30:40.639
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU HAVE
MY PERMISSION TO EAT ME.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.208
- THANK YOU, TEDDY.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.010
THAT'S THE MOST GENEROUS THING

30:44.043 --> 30:45.777
ANY PERSON EVER SAID
TO ANOTHER.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.483
LOOK, IT'S A HIGHWAY.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.485
- BUT WHICH WAY DO WE GO?

30:53.519 --> 30:56.355
- WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.957
- TO HELL WITH THAT!

30:57.990 --> 31:00.292
IT HASN'T LED US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION YET.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.428
- WH... SHH, SHH!

31:02.461 --> 31:04.997
WHAT?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.632
- DON'T YOU HEAR IT?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.100
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.269
- NATIVE AMERICANS
USED TO DO THIS

31:10.302 --> 31:13.039
TO HEAR WHICH WAY THE CAVALRY
WAS ADVANCING.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.541
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
TO JUST LOOK?

31:20.279 --> 31:22.114
- OH, MY GOD.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.117
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S THE LIBERTY RIDE.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.385
- HI, GUYS!
- BUT HOW?

31:26.418 --> 31:29.989
I GUESS EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T
KNOW IT,

31:30.022 --> 31:32.391
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ON
THE RIGHT ROAD ALL ALONG.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.994
- COME ON.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.662
- WHERE YOU BEEN?
- HEY! HI, GUYS.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.397
- HEY, GUYS.
- HI.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.032
[all laughing, shouting]

31:40.066 --> 31:44.003
- * IT'S SO GOOD
TO TELL MY STORY *

31:44.036 --> 31:48.074
* ABOUT THE LIFE
THAT HAS BEEN SAVED *

31:48.107 --> 31:52.211
* IT'S SO GOOD
TO SING ABOUT IT *

31:52.244 --> 31:56.582
* TO SING OF LOVE,
THE LOVE YOU GAVE *

31:56.615 --> 32:01.053
* ENTER THE GATES
WITH THANKSGIVING *

32:01.087 --> 32:04.957

32:04.991 --> 32:10.296

32:10.329 --> 32:13.365
- CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.434
HERE'S JUICE.
IT'LL PERK YOU RIGHT UP.

32:15.467 --> 32:21.307
THERE YOU GO, HONEY.
GOOD FOR YOU.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.610
THERE YOU GO, HONEY.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.078
HEY.

32:26.112 --> 32:30.016
- HUH, WE DID IT, TEDDY.
- WE DID IT.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.056
- WELCOME HOME, GUYS.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.326
WELCOME HOME.
HOW'D YOU GET HERE SO FAST?

32:40.359 --> 32:44.463
- MWAH! FAITH, FOCUS,
FORTITUDE.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.099
- NOT TO MENTION PEDALING OUR
FUCKING FANNIES OFF.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.336
- AW, POOR BABY.
- HI.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.470
- WELL, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF SUNSHINE

32:51.503 --> 32:54.406
STRAIGHT FROM HOLLYWOOD.
HI, HONEY.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.741
- HOW WAS IT OUT THERE,
SWEETIE?

32:55.774 --> 32:57.676
- IT WAS AMAZING.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.245
BUT I'M SORRY I MISSED
THE RIDE.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.347
- OH, YOU MADE THE BEST PART,
THE BIG FINISH.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.082
- HEY, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO WENT ALONG.

33:03.115 --> 33:06.752
- BRIAN? YEAH, HE TOLD ME
HE WASN'T GOING.

33:06.785 --> 33:09.155
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE HAD A LITTLE INJURY.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.756
- IS HE ALL RIGHT?

33:10.789 --> 33:14.493
- STUBBORN SON OF A BITCH
INSISTED ON FINISHING THE RIDE.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.363
GET SOME JUICE, COME ON.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.631
- WHOO!

33:19.665 --> 33:22.101
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE!

33:22.134 --> 33:28.307
OH, I AM SO PROUD OF MY MEN.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.142
SO WHERE'S MICHAEL?

33:30.176 --> 33:31.577
- WITH BRIAN.
- YEAH, YEAH, BUT DON'T WORRY,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.113
THEY SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

33:34.146 --> 33:44.523
- * ENTER THE GATES
WITH THANKSGIVING *

33:44.556 --> 33:48.727
* FINISH THE RACE

33:52.564 --> 33:57.703
* 'CAUSE NOT THE PAST
IS HISTORY *

34:10.582 --> 34:15.154
- I STILL CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO THEM.

34:15.187 --> 34:18.290
- I'M STARTING TO GET WORRIED.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.592
ACTUALLY, I STARTED GETTING
WORRIED FOUR HOURS AGO.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.599
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GO OUT
SEARCHING.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.477
- LOOK.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.784
- NO!

34:45.817 --> 34:48.620
LET HIM FINISH.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.604
- [panting]

35:05.637 --> 35:07.806
- COME ON.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.744
- I CAN'T.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.380
I CAN'T.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.784
- WE--WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

35:18.817 --> 35:22.254
- FUCK IT.
JUST FUCK IT.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.400
- YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT.
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

36:08.434 --> 36:11.570
- WHOO!
- COME ON!

36:11.603 --> 36:13.572

36:13.605 --> 36:14.740

36:17.643 --> 36:19.411

ALMOST THERE.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.713
[laughter]

36:26.452 --> 36:27.719
- YES!

36:31.757 --> 36:34.693
OH!
- HEY.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.363
- SWEET.
WAY TO GO.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.298
[laughs]
I WAS SO WORRIED.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.433
- I COULD KILL YOU
FOR DOING THIS.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.335
- YEAH, WELL,
I ALMOST SAVED YOU THE TROUBLE.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.471
- OKAY.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.608
- WE THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.677
- THERE'S NO NEED.
BRIAN'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.514
- NO, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.850
LINDSAY CALLED
AROUND AN HOUR AGO.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.320
YOU'RE A DAD.

37:01.353 --> 37:05.424
- [laughing]

37:14.366 --> 37:17.603
- I'M A GRANDMA.
[laughing]

37:17.636 --> 37:21.373
- YEAH, RIGHT?
- WAY TO GO, MICHAEL.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.014
- OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT HER.

37:29.047 --> 37:32.017
OH.
YOU'RE SO TINY.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.353
- SHE DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY
COMING OUT.

37:34.386 --> 37:37.756
- THE LABOR LASTED 14 HOURS.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.491
- IT WAS LIKE PASSING
A BOWLING BALL

37:39.525 --> 37:41.760
THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.663
- T.M.I.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.965
- TOO MUCH INFORMATION.
- [chuckles]

37:46.998 --> 37:50.369
- BUT YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE FINALLY HERE.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.371
- HAVE YOU PICKED OUT A NAME?

37:52.404 --> 37:56.375
- CONTINGENT ON THE APPROVAL
OF ALL THREE PARTIES,

37:56.408 --> 38:00.512
I WAS THINKING JENNY REBECCA.
- OH.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.081
- LATE GRANDMOTHERS?
- EARLY STREISAND.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.486
- WELL, HEY, UH,
LET'S TAKE A PICTURE.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.056
[camera shutter clicks]

38:11.089 --> 38:14.993
OH, OKAY.
UH, NOW ALL THREE PARENTS.

38:18.430 --> 38:22.067
SMILE.
[camera shutter clicks]

38:22.100 --> 38:23.569
OH, PERFECT.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.572
OKAY, NOW, HOW ABOUT ONE
WITH THE TWO HAPPY MOMS?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.011
COME ON, GET CLOSER.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.383
CLOSER.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.886
[camera shutter clicks]
GOT IT.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.755
OH, THAT'LL BE ONE TO FRAME.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.360
[baby coos]

38:48.394 --> 38:51.530
[indistinct chatter]

38:55.133 --> 38:58.570
- [chuckles]
THERE YOU GO.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.573
THE "JENNY REBECCA TRIPLE
RIPPLE HOT FUDGE SUNDAE,"

39:01.607 --> 39:04.510
NAMED IN HONOR OF MY GORGEOUS
NEW GRANDDAUGHTER.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.111
- IT TOOK JOAN CRAWFORD 20 YEARS

39:06.144 --> 39:08.747
TO GET A SANDWICH NAMED
AFTER HER AT THE STAGE DELI.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.582
- WHY DON'T YOU BOYS SIT DOWN?

39:10.616 --> 39:12.918
- UH, THANKS,
BUT, UH, WE PREFER TO STAND.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.786
- BUMS ARE A LITTLE BATTERED.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.456
- AH.
WELL, YOU, I UNDERSTAND.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.990
BUT YOU?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.726
YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO NELLY BOTTOMS EVERYWHERE.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.929
[laughter]

39:23.962 --> 39:25.497
- [clears throat]
THE FIRST THING I DID

39:25.531 --> 39:27.132
WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT--
WEIGH MYSELF.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.767
- [scoffs] YOU TOO?
- MM-HMM.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.136
- SO HOW MUCH DID YOU LOSE?
- SEVEN POUNDS.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.938
- FIVE AND A HALF.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.773
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.876
- LOST WEIGHT?
- THE RIDE, EM.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.512
- SURE YOU COULD'VE.

39:40.546 --> 39:43.482
- MAYBE.

39:43.515 --> 39:46.084
BUT I'D RATHER HAVE DONE IT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.957
HEY, NO, MINE,
- QUIT IT.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.460
- YOU JUST QUIT THAT.
- AH, AH.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.632
- PSST.
- CARL!

40:00.666 --> 40:03.969
- LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.
- I LOVE IT.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.937
- I THOUGHT YOU WOULD.
- OH.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.973
- IT'S A LOT MORE ACCURATE
THAN THE ONE YOU'RE WEARING.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.975
- [laughs]

40:10.008 --> 40:11.643
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.513
- SO NOW THAT YOU'RE
A GRANDMOTHER,

40:14.546 --> 40:17.182
ARE YOU READY TO BE A BRIDE?
- CARL...

40:17.215 --> 40:20.185
- WHAT KIND OF A WEDDING
DO YOU WANT--BIG, SMALL?

40:20.218 --> 40:21.787
INDOOR, OUTDOOR?

40:21.820 --> 40:23.822
ALTHOUGH
IT'S STILL A LITTLE NIPPY.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.493
IT'S UP TO YOU.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.830
- WHATEVER I SAY?

40:31.863 --> 40:35.200
- IN THAT CASE...

40:35.233 --> 40:37.068
I DON'T WANT A WEDDING.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.705
- NO WEDDING?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.006
- I CAN'T MARRY YOU,

40:41.039 --> 40:43.008
AND NOT BECAUSE
I DON'T LOVE YOU,

40:43.041 --> 40:44.876
'CAUSE GOD KNOWS I DO.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.846
- THEN WHAT?

40:47.879 --> 40:52.017
- HOW CAN I GET MARRIED
WHEN MY OWN SON CAN'T?

40:52.050 --> 40:54.085
AND THE--
AND THE GODDAMN PRESIDENT

40:54.119 --> 40:56.555
WANTS TO CHANGE
THE CONSTITUTION

40:56.588 --> 40:58.023
TO PREVENT MICHAEL AND BEN

40:58.056 --> 41:00.025
AND--AND ALL THE OTHER
BEAUTIFUL GAY MEN AND WOMEN

41:00.058 --> 41:04.162
FROM HAVING THE SAME RIGHTS
THAT YOU AND I DO.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.565
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

41:06.598 --> 41:09.868
- THAT'S VERY NOBLE, SWEETHEART,
BUT YOU'RE JUST ONE PERSON.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.571
- WELL, SOMETIMES
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.573
LOOK AT GANDHI.

41:14.606 --> 41:18.610
BEN KINGSLEY STARVED HIMSELF,
BUT IT TURNED THE TIDE.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.747
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STARVE YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

41:21.780 --> 41:24.883
- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
I'M HUMANLY CAPABLE OF.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.052
I AM GOING TO SEND A MESSAGE

41:27.085 --> 41:30.255
AND THE FINGER
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

41:30.288 --> 41:34.593
UNTIL MY SON
CAN WALK DOWN THE AISLE

41:34.626 --> 41:36.261
IN THIS COUNTRY,

41:36.294 --> 41:39.197
THEN NEITHER WILL I.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.738
- [sighs]

41:46.772 --> 41:50.275
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

41:50.308 --> 41:54.913
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT LIVING TOGETHER...

41:54.946 --> 41:56.848
IN SIN?

41:58.316 --> 42:00.919
- [chuckles]

42:00.952 --> 42:03.288
AREN'T WE A LITTLE TOO OLD
FOR THAT?

42:03.321 --> 42:06.291
- CHRIST, I HOPE NOT.

42:06.324 --> 42:09.227
- [laughs]

42:11.096 --> 42:15.300
- SHE'S SO MUCH CALMER
THAN GUS WAS.

42:15.333 --> 42:18.236
YES, YOU ARE, YOU CUTIE.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.639
REMEMBER HOW FIDGETY
AND FUSSY HE WAS?

42:20.672 --> 42:23.308
- I SHOULD.
IT WAS MY BREAST.

42:23.341 --> 42:26.912
- WELL, THIS ISN'T NEARLY
AS PAINFUL AS I THOUGHT.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.780
- GET BACK TO ME
IN A FEW WEEKS.

42:28.814 --> 42:32.784
YOU'LL BE WISHING SHE'D FIND
SOMEPLACE ELSE TO EAT.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.653
AW.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.822
YOU'RE FINALLY HERE.

42:38.356 --> 42:41.727
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
YOUR MOMMY WANTED YOU

42:41.760 --> 42:44.730
AND WHAT SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH
TO GET YOU.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.332
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE SURE AND TELL HER.

42:47.365 --> 42:49.200
- THAT OLD JEWISH RECIPE?

42:49.234 --> 42:52.804
ADD ONE TABLESPOON OF GUILT
TO MOTHER'S MILK, STIR BRISKLY.

42:52.838 --> 42:56.141
[both laughing]

42:56.174 --> 42:57.943
- AH.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.811
WE HAVE, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

42:59.845 --> 43:02.914
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
GOD HAS EVER CREATED.

43:02.948 --> 43:06.652
- I WON'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
- THAT'S NICE FOR A CHANGE.

43:09.187 --> 43:11.122
I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

43:14.660 --> 43:17.829
- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
- NO, I'M FINE.

43:17.863 --> 43:20.699
- ALL RIGHT, YOUNG LADY,
TIME FOR YOUR NAP.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.267
YOU'LL SEE YOUR MOMMIES LATER.

43:25.036 --> 43:28.006
- YEAH.
- SWEET DREAMS, SWEETHEART.

43:28.039 --> 43:30.008
- SLEEP TIGHT.

43:39.217 --> 43:42.721
- I CONTACTED THE CENTER'S
CHILD-CARE SERVICES.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.055
THEY HAVE A LIST
OF SEVERAL WOMEN

43:44.089 --> 43:45.857
WHO CAN COME HELP YOU OUT.

43:45.891 --> 43:48.860
AND DUSTY SAID IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING, YOU CAN CALL HER.

43:48.894 --> 43:50.361
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

43:52.898 --> 43:56.001
THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING?

43:56.034 --> 43:59.204
- IT'S WHAT
WE BOTH AGREED TO...

43:59.237 --> 44:02.307
ISN'T IT?

44:29.100 --> 44:32.437
- ON BEHALF
OF THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER,

44:32.470 --> 44:35.240
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT
LIBERTY HOUSE

44:35.273 --> 44:37.075
WITH THIS CHECK

44:37.108 --> 44:41.246
FOR $432,000.

44:41.279 --> 44:44.382
[cheers and applause]

44:46.952 --> 44:49.921
- EVERY CENT RAISED WILL GO
TO MAINTAINING THE HOSPICE

44:49.955 --> 44:53.091
AND PROVIDING ITS CLIENTS
WITH THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.360
- WE'D LIKE TO THANK
EVERYONE WHO RODE,

44:55.393 --> 44:57.095
WHO LENT THEIR SUPPORT,

44:57.128 --> 45:00.732
THEIR TIME, THEIR SPONSORSHIP.

45:00.766 --> 45:04.469
[applause]

45:04.502 --> 45:08.473
AND NOW, IN HONOR OF ONE OF OUR
BROTHERS WHO WE RECENTLY LOST...

45:08.506 --> 45:11.943
- A GREAT FRIEND,
A VOLUNTEER, AND SUPPORTER...

45:11.977 --> 45:14.412
- LIBERTY HOUSE
HAS BEEN RENAMED

45:14.445 --> 45:18.116
VIC GRASSI HOUSE.

45:18.149 --> 45:21.920
[applause]

45:25.991 --> 45:29.127
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

45:31.029 --> 45:33.498
- [speaks indistinctly]
- YEAH.

45:33.531 --> 45:36.367
- [scoffs]
GOD.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.805
- DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

45:56.822 --> 45:59.090
- YOU GOT THEM TO DO THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

46:01.893 --> 46:05.263
- IT'S STILL AMERICA, DEB.
MONEY TALKS.

46:05.296 --> 46:07.966
- YEAH, BUT FOR ONCE,
IT SAID THE RIGHT THING.

46:16.942 --> 46:18.543
- [sighs]

46:18.576 --> 46:21.813
YOUR UNCLE
WOULD BE SO PROUD.

46:21.847 --> 46:25.283
- TOO BAD HE COULDN'T BE HERE
TO SEE IT.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.785
- HE SEES IT.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.822
COME ON.

46:34.926 --> 46:37.228
- * ARE YOU STANDING BY?

46:37.262 --> 46:38.363
*

46:38.396 --> 46:42.433
* OR WILL YOU BE READY?

46:42.467 --> 46:45.570
* ARE YOU STANDING BY?

46:45.603 --> 46:48.606
* OR WILL YOU BE READY

46:48.639 --> 46:54.179
* FOR THIS TONIGHT?

46:54.212 --> 47:02.153
*

47:03.621 --> 47:06.357
* READY, READY, READY, READY

47:06.391 --> 47:07.959
*

47:07.993 --> 47:11.329
* READY, READY, READY, READY

47:11.362 --> 47:15.533
* READY, READY

47:15.566 --> 47:23.841
*

47:26.111 --> 47:27.245
- SO...

47:27.278 --> 47:30.481
HAVE I ATONED FOR MY SINS?

47:30.515 --> 47:32.650
- THAT WOULD TAKE AN ETERNITY.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.485
BUT YOU SURE AS HELL
GET AN "A" FOR EFFORT.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.621
- PLEASE DON'T SAY "HELL."

47:36.654 --> 47:40.992
- BY THE WAY,
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU.

47:41.026 --> 47:45.163
I WAS DAMN LUCKY TO GET
THOSE FOUR EXTRA YEARS.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.233
SURE, I'D HAVE LIKED MORE.
WHO WOULDN'T?

47:48.266 --> 47:51.669
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.371
- DID GOD TELL YOU THAT?

47:53.404 --> 47:56.641
- ACTUALLY, HE TOLD JUDY,
AND SHE TOLD ME.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.143
- JUDY?

47:58.176 --> 47:59.978
- GARLAND.

48:00.011 --> 48:02.513
THEY'RE LIKE THIS.
- [chuckles]

48:02.547 --> 48:04.182
YOU MEAN GOD'S A--

48:04.215 --> 48:07.152
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT
FROM ME.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.655
[laughs]

48:10.688 --> 48:12.590
- OW!

48:13.724 --> 48:15.126
OW.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.162
- YOU OKAY?

48:20.331 --> 48:22.667
- YEAH, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.603
I HEARD IT
ON THE BEST AUTHORITY.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.475
[sighs]

48:31.709 --> 48:33.278
SO DID YOU FUCK TOM CRUISE?

48:33.311 --> 48:38.283
- [chuckles]
EVERYBODY KNOWS HE'S NOT GAY.

48:38.316 --> 48:39.717
- ADRIEN BRODY?

48:39.750 --> 48:43.688
- NICE, BUT ALAS...

48:43.721 --> 48:44.956
- TOBEY MAGUIRE?

48:44.990 --> 48:48.026
- PLEASE.
- WHAT?

48:48.059 --> 48:50.295
- [whispers]
CONNOR JAMES.

48:50.328 --> 48:51.963
- [laughs]

48:51.997 --> 48:53.498
NO SHIT.
- MM-HMM.

48:53.531 --> 48:57.302
[both chuckle]

48:57.335 --> 49:00.738
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A MOST EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.

49:00.771 --> 49:05.610
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU DID TOO.
- [sighs]

49:05.643 --> 49:10.048
BICYCLING DOWN
LIFE'S ENDLESS HIGHWAYS...

49:10.081 --> 49:12.650
I HAD TIME TO THINK.

49:12.683 --> 49:13.718
- OH?

49:13.751 --> 49:17.622
- ABOUT WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY

49:17.655 --> 49:21.359
IF I SURVIVED CANCER...

49:21.392 --> 49:24.062
AND SLEEPING IN A TENT.

49:24.095 --> 49:26.497
- EQUALLY UNPLEASANT,
I AGREE.

49:28.233 --> 49:31.136
BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE,
WHAT DID YOU DECIDE?

49:33.404 --> 49:36.741
- THE FIRST THING
I'D DO DIFFERENTLY...

49:36.774 --> 49:38.509
IS THE BEDROOM.

49:38.543 --> 49:40.345
[chuckles]

49:40.378 --> 49:43.348
AND GET RID OF THAT THING
OVER THE BED.

49:43.381 --> 49:47.152
- YEAH, IT'S VERY '90s.
I AGREE.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.520
- [groans]

49:49.554 --> 49:54.192
AND THEN I'D LIKE
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY SON.

49:55.393 --> 49:56.761
HE'S AT AN AGE NOW

49:56.794 --> 50:01.632
WHERE HE NEEDS
A STRONG, MASCULINE INFLUENCE.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.669
ESPECIALLY BEING RAISED
BY A COUPLE OF DYKES.

50:06.571 --> 50:10.541
I MEAN,
HE'S GOT TO KNOW ABOUT ARMANI...

50:10.575 --> 50:12.810
GUCCI, PRADA,

50:12.843 --> 50:17.182
NOT JUST FOOTBALL
AND ENGINE-TUNING.

50:17.215 --> 50:19.650
- UNQUESTIONABLY.

50:19.684 --> 50:22.453
ANY OTHER DECISIONS?
[can sets on counter]

50:22.487 --> 50:24.422
[can opens]

50:25.590 --> 50:29.560
- I WANT YOU
TO MOVE BACK IN.

50:29.594 --> 50:31.262
- HUH?

50:31.296 --> 50:32.563
- I SAID I'D LIKE IT

50:32.597 --> 50:35.300
IF YOU AND I
WERE TO LIVE TOGETHER.

50:35.333 --> 50:37.268
- [chuckles]

50:37.302 --> 50:38.536
ARE YOU PROPOSING?

50:38.569 --> 50:39.804
- COURSE NOT.

50:39.837 --> 50:41.672
WITH THE SUDDEN
AND UNEXPECTED PLETHORA

50:41.706 --> 50:42.707
OF GAY MARRIAGES,

50:42.740 --> 50:45.443
I'D HATE TO ADD TO THE GLUT.

50:45.476 --> 50:47.445
ALL THIS RUNNING
BACK AND FORTH

50:47.478 --> 50:51.682
BETWEEN HERE AND DAPHNE'S IS
TIME-CONSUMING AND INCONVENIENT.

50:51.716 --> 50:53.584
I MEAN, JUST LAST WEEK,
YOU FORGOT YOUR SOCKS

50:53.618 --> 50:56.587
AND HAD TO BORROW
A PAIR OF MINE.

50:57.755 --> 51:01.192
AND...

51:01.226 --> 51:03.828
AS FOR THE TIMES
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND,

51:03.861 --> 51:07.532
I WOULDN'T PARTICULARLY MIND IT
IF YOU WERE.

51:09.334 --> 51:10.635
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO ASK ME THAT

51:10.668 --> 51:14.272
SINCE THE FIRST NIGHT
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

51:17.475 --> 51:22.247
- WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY?

51:22.280 --> 51:24.715
SHOULD I MAKE ROOM
IN MY DRAWERS

51:24.749 --> 51:26.651
FOR YOUR DRAWERS?

51:34.225 --> 51:36.161
- [chuckles]

51:48.639 --> 51:51.776
- BEN?

51:56.181 --> 51:58.916
BEN?

51:58.949 --> 52:02.753
- [groans]
HMM?

52:02.787 --> 52:05.823
- I WAS JUST SEEING
IF YOU WERE ASLEEP.

52:07.425 --> 52:09.360
- I'M WIDE AWAKE...

52:09.394 --> 52:12.363
NOW.

52:12.397 --> 52:14.899
ARE YOU OKAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

52:14.932 --> 52:18.169
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO SETTLE DOWN, YOU KNOW?

52:18.203 --> 52:19.770
TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT,
I GUESS.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.806
- AH.

52:21.839 --> 52:24.575
IT HAS BEEN PRETTY EVENTFUL.

52:24.609 --> 52:28.313
- NO SHIT.
MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.282
THE RIDE AND THE BABY

52:31.316 --> 52:32.683
AND THE WEDDING.

52:32.717 --> 52:35.686
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE'RE REALLY MARRIED?

52:36.954 --> 52:40.191
- ARE WE?

52:40.225 --> 52:42.593
REALLY?

52:45.830 --> 52:48.966
- OF COURSE WE ARE.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.836
- BUT WE DON'T LIVE IN CANADA.
WE LIVE HERE.

52:51.869 --> 52:55.306
SO IS IT...

52:55.340 --> 52:56.541
STILL REAL?

52:56.574 --> 52:59.710
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

52:59.744 --> 53:03.814
EVEN IF IT WAS REAL
FOR JUST A DAY,

53:03.848 --> 53:06.451
WAS IT WORTH IT?

53:09.754 --> 53:11.656
[chuckles]

53:13.324 --> 53:15.426
- SO WORTH IT.

53:15.460 --> 53:17.595
- IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE IT HAPPENS HERE.

53:17.628 --> 53:20.731
IT'S ALL BEGINNING,

53:20.765 --> 53:23.334
AND WE'RE PART OF IT.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.979
- YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

53:35.012 --> 53:38.483
WE NEVER REALLY HAD
A PROPER WEDDING NIGHT.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.987
- SURE, WE DID.

53:43.020 --> 53:45.723
SHIVERING IN OUR TENT.

53:45.756 --> 53:49.294
HMM.
ON OUR LITTLE AIR MATTRESSES.

53:50.795 --> 53:53.364
- I THINK
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

53:53.398 --> 53:55.700
- MM?
