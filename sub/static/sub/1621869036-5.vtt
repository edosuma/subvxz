00:42.480 --> 00:44.440
We need to get to London.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.960
What's in London?

00:48.240 --> 00:49.240
Him.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.400
Here.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.280
Hey. I think I see your Professor.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.120
He was teaching at Tythehurst College
when he wrote the book.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.120
Have you thought about what we're going
to do if we can't find him?

02:27.320 --> 02:28.800
We have to.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.840
That isn't really an answer.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.360
They're out of cola bottles.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
It's bullshit.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.400
I found this in your pocket.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.040
Whose blood is this?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.960
It's mine. I cut myself...

05:43.160 --> 05:44.160
Where?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.200
Show me.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.600
Did you kill Ash?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.840
What?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.560
What are you talking about?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.080
Don't talk to me like that!

05:57.360 --> 05:58.640
And don't lie to me...

06:00.440 --> 06:01.680
I didn't mean to...

06:03.920 --> 06:05.280
I promise, mum.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.280
I really didn't mean to.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.280
Sacha...

06:12.360 --> 06:15.600
Bill wanted to take Emily to a lab
so he could keep experimenting on her.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
I had to stop him.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.440
What is that to do with Ash?

06:22.680 --> 06:25.320
Ash walked in on us. There was a fight.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.280
I didn't mean to kill him.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.080
It was an accident...

06:30.160 --> 06:31.200
What about Bill?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.080
What did you do with his body?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.320
He's alive. He ran away.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.000
What do you think the others will do
when they find out you killed Ash?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.280
They think the aliens killed him.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.440
And if he comes back
and tells them it was you?

06:47.520 --> 06:49.400
I was doing it for Emily.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.040
I love her.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.600
You barely know her.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.880
This is crazy.

06:55.960 --> 06:59.320
You kill someone
because you like some girl you just met?

07:00.640 --> 07:03.080
I don't expect you to understand.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
Oh yeah?

07:05.360 --> 07:07.120
So make me understand.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.840
We have to go.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.880
We have to leave before the others
realise what you did.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.520
I'm not going anywhere without Emily.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.440
They will kill you, Sacha.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.960
I won't be able to stop them.
We have to go.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.280
You go if you want to.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.360
I'm staying.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.080
I won't let you become like him,
like your father.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.520
I won't let that happen...

07:35.360 --> 07:38.520
I'm not a child any more.
You can't make me do anything.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.320
Sacha. Please...

07:40.400 --> 07:42.760
You want me to choose
between you and Emily?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.840
I choose her.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.880
Come on!

19:20.080 --> 19:25.440
His name isn't on any of the offices,
or list of classes.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.200
You think it's the wrong university?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.960
He wrote the book 5 years ago.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.560
Maybe this whole thing was crazy.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.200
I wanted to believe
we could change things.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.480
Because I needed to believe something.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.880
You want me to take the first watch?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.840
You should get some sleep.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.320
You think I was wrong to
make us come to London?

21:43.520 --> 21:47.160
It doesn't matter what
anyone else thinks.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.000
That's not fair.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.520
You know why Sophia went along
with your crazy plan?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.720
Because you needed it.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.920
It was for you,
because you're so screwed up

22:03.000 --> 22:05.760
you can't even cry when
the man you love dies.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.320
You promised her that you'd make
a better future for our baby.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.240
I tried.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.080
Was it really about our baby...

22:19.960 --> 22:22.560
or was it a mathematical problem...

22:24.160 --> 22:25.960
something you wanted to solve?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.560
Don't worry.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.960
It's not the first time
you've let her down.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.200
You've never been there for her...

22:40.920 --> 22:42.520
I'll wake you in two hours.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.880
I saw a light.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.200
It might be our professor.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.040
There were people living here.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.480
You think he killed himself?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.000
Looks that way.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.400
He bandaged his wrist?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.800
Maybe he changed his mind.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.240
Don't shoot it! Don't shoot it!

29:45.520 --> 29:46.880
What is that?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.280
I don't know.

31:15.920 --> 31:16.920
Wait.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.240
Should you be doing this?
What about the baby?

31:20.320 --> 31:24.040
Don't worry. It's okay to carry
dead bodies in your first trimester.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.360
You think he'd just had enough?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.000
I guess so...

31:33.120 --> 31:34.800
I'll check the rest of the building.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.880
This data is full of the same constants
that appear in the notebook.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.520
You planning on getting any sleep?

40:57.160 --> 40:58.400
Hey.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.960
Hey.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
What time is it?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.840
Just after nine.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.160
How's your new pet?

41:16.280 --> 41:17.680
Did you give it a name?

41:17.760 --> 41:18.800
No.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.640
He looks like a Bob.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.200
Bob is really smart.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.720
All this data.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.040
It took me all night
to figure out what it is.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.120
-What is it?
-Watch.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.600
Wait. You're going
to hit Bob with a hammer?

41:46.680 --> 41:48.240
Look at the screen...

41:55.000 --> 41:56.560
It's analysing my movement.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.440
Not just my actual movement.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.680
It's calculating every possible movement
I could make...

42:01.360 --> 42:02.440
Look.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
This.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.840
Or this.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.200
Or this.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.040
It's calculating all the possibilities
in an instant.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.920
And this makes Bob smart?

42:19.040 --> 42:21.840
His sensors work on a quantum level.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.160
I can feed this data into the formulas
in the notebook.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.360
It should help me understand them.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.240
So you and Bob are working together now?

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
Yes.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.960
He's my assistant.
