[crow cawing]

00:12.313 --> 00:14.482
- DAMN!
SHELBY PUT ON SOME WEIGHT.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.583
- HE LOVED A GOOD PINT,
HE DID.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.451
- BAD ONE TOO, IT FEELS LIKE.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.420
[both grunting]

00:36.704 --> 00:38.406
- YOU'RE DAFT, WALLACE.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.707
- LOOK IT UP
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.609
- I'M A SON
OF THE EMERALD ISLE.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.145
I KNOW THE LYRICS
TO ME WILD IRISH ROSE,

00:44.178 --> 00:46.380
AND THEY'RE NOT,
"YOU MAY SEARCH EVERY HAIR,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.349
BUT NONE SHALL COMPARE..."

00:48.382 --> 00:49.683
THEY'RE,
"YOU MAY SEARCH EVERYWHERE--"

00:49.717 --> 00:52.786
- [gasps]

00:52.820 --> 00:55.556
- TOP O' THE MORNING,
MR. BOHANNON.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.826
- COME ON.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.597
both: WHOA.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.513
- WE THOUGHT YOU WAS
FOR THE MUCK WAGON, SIR.

01:22.716 --> 01:26.454
- NOT YET, GENTLEMEN.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.588
NOT YET.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.403
[Western folk music]

01:42.436 --> 01:50.278
*

02:14.702 --> 02:18.572
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU
WHEN YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.509
- I WENT TO SEE THE CHURCH LADY.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.245
DON'T WORRY.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.746
WASN'T HER THAT DONE THIS.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.516
[groans]

02:28.549 --> 02:30.751
- COULD HAVE WAITED
UNTIL THE MORNING.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.587
- NO, NEEDED DOING.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.590
ASKED HER
TO HELP YOU AND WILLIAM.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.791
- [sighs]

02:37.825 --> 02:41.462
THE RAILROAD CAN SPARE YOU
FOR A DAY.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.931
- CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU
AND THE BABY IF I DON'T WORK.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.799
- LET ME AT LEAST
GO GET YOU SOME FOOD.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.868
- DAY'S ALREADY WASTING.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.784
- OH, BY ALL MEANS, BOHANNON,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.720
OOH.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.656
MAKING FRIENDS, I SEE.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.791
- REAL FRIENDLY TOWN
YOU GOT HERE.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.361
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MR. BOHANNON?

03:13.394 --> 03:16.730
THE LOCAL "DENIZENRY" NOT TAKEN
WITH YOUR ROUGH CHARM?

03:16.764 --> 03:17.798
- "DENIZENRY" AIN'T A WORD.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.800
- YES, IT IS.
- NO, IT AIN'T.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.503
- YES--ANYWAY,
I CAN HAVE YOU ARRESTED

03:22.536 --> 03:24.305
FOR STEALING
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.540
- HUNTINGTON'S ALREADY THROUGH--
[groans]

03:26.574 --> 03:27.875
THROUGH THE SIERRAS.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.810
YOUR CHIEF ENGINEER
ALMOST GOT HISSELF KILLED

03:29.843 --> 03:31.579
PROVING HE CAN'T BLAST
THROUGH A SHALE MOUNTAIN.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.847
[scoffs]
YOU NEED TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.849
- THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.819
MY SURVEYORS COULD NOT FIND
A PASSABLE ROUTE OVER THE PEAK.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.987
- FIGURED I'D GIVE HER
ANOTHER LOOK.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.491
- YOUR JOB,
OUT ON THE GRADE, BOHANNON.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.626
- NOT TODAY.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.697
TAKE THIS COMPASS.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.766
MY CHIEF ENGINEER
BROKE THAT ONE.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.507
- THAT MAN SHOULD BE FIRED.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.774
- HE SAVED YOUR LIFE.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.843
- HE IS INSUBORDINATE
AND RECKLESS.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.750
- HE MAY WELL SAVE THE HASH
YOU'VE MADE OUT OF THE TUNNEL.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.386
- THE TUNNEL WAS YOUR IDEA.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.855
I HAVE DONE EXACTLY
AS YOU ORDERED.

04:14.888 --> 04:18.726
- YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN ME
THROUGH SHERMAN PEAK!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.394
BOHANNON STAYS.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.466
- I HEARD FORT SMITH
IS HARBORING THEM MORMONS

04:25.499 --> 04:26.734
WHO SHOT UP TOWN.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.835
AIN'T NOTHING STOPPING 'EM

04:27.868 --> 04:29.737
FROM SADDLING UP
AND DOING IT AGAIN.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.439
- WHY WOULD A MORMON
MAKE THIS TOWN HOME?

04:31.472 --> 04:32.773
NONE OF HER PEOPLE ARE HERE.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.576
- SHE'S MARRIED
TO CULLEN BOHANNON.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
- HE'S MORMON TOO?

04:36.810 --> 04:37.745
- HE'S A RAILROAD MAN.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.912
- WHO TOOK A CHILD BRIDE.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.748
THEY DON'T KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG

04:40.781 --> 04:42.082
BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE
IN THE BIBLE.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.785
- IT'S TRUE.
MORMONS ARE A VIOLENT CULT.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.786
IF THEY DON'T SEEK REDEMPTION,

04:45.819 --> 04:48.622
NOTHING WILL SAVE THEM
FROM THE FIRES OF HELL.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.825
[baby fussing]

04:54.795 --> 04:56.797
- I NEED SOME KEROSENE...

04:56.830 --> 04:58.899
AND MATCHES TOO.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.577
MORMONS DO BELIEVE
IN THE BIBLE.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.746
AND WE ALSO FOLLOW THE TEACHINGS
OF JESUS CHRIST,

05:12.780 --> 05:16.450
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES
TO KINDNESS TO OTHERS.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.665
- MICHAEL MCGINNES?

05:31.699 --> 05:32.833
- THERE WE GO.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.808
Y'ALL KNOW VERY WELL
WHO I AM.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.944
- I'M CLOSING YOUR CASINO.
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

05:43.977 --> 05:47.781
- THIS BUILDING IS CONDEMNED
BY ORDER OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

05:47.815 --> 05:48.982
- CLEAR IT OUT!

05:49.016 --> 05:50.551
ON YOUR FEET!
- HEY!

05:50.584 --> 05:52.786
[indistinct shouting]

05:52.820 --> 05:55.088
- COME ON.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.958
- COME ON, YOU WHORE.
- GET YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF OF ME!

05:57.991 --> 06:00.928
- YOU, UNHAND THAT LADY!

06:00.961 --> 06:02.496
- GET OUT!

06:02.530 --> 06:05.633
- COME ON!
[woman screams]

06:05.666 --> 06:07.968
- MOVE IT ALONG!

06:09.570 --> 06:11.572
- LET'S GO, YOU DUMB MICK.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.949
- THAT'S ENOUGH, MICKEY!

06:23.517 --> 06:24.952
- SHUT DOWN MY BAR, WILL YOU?

06:30.858 --> 06:32.893
- GET UP. GET UP!

06:38.732 --> 06:41.502
- DON'T RESIST, MICKEY.
I'LL GET YOU OUT.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.871
- HEAR THAT? DURANT RUNS
THIS TOWN, NOT YOU LOT.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.641
HE'LL HAVE ME OUT
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY.

07:35.122 --> 07:40.060
- I TRUST THE MILITIA
IS TREATING YOU FAIRLY.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.997
- OH.
WELL, YES.

07:44.031 --> 07:48.736
MY INTERNMENT HAS GIVEN ME
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR...

07:48.769 --> 07:53.641
DEEP PRAYER
AND REFLECTION.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.009
I HAVE BEEN PRAYING

07:56.043 --> 07:58.211
FOR MINE ENEMIES,

07:58.245 --> 08:01.048
AS JESUS DID
DURING HIS INCARCERATION

08:01.081 --> 08:03.116
BEFORE CRUCIFIXION.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.086
- BISHOP DUTSON, PLEASE.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.021
- HE IS NOT A BISHOP.

08:08.055 --> 08:12.159
WE ALL HEARD HIS CONFESSION.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.161
- WHAT...

08:14.194 --> 08:16.564
EXACTLY...

08:18.966 --> 08:19.933
DID YOU HEAR?

08:19.967 --> 08:23.971
- YOU SAID YOU DROWNED
THE REAL BISHOP DUTSON.

08:24.004 --> 08:24.872
- ARE YOU SURE?

08:24.905 --> 08:29.142
DID THE WARD CLERK
TAKE ANY SUCH NOTES?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.044
- NO.
- OH.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.079
- BUT I HEARD YOU.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.081
- YOU HEARD
THE HOLY SPIRIT

08:34.114 --> 08:36.984
SPEAKING THROUGH YOUR BISHOP,

08:37.017 --> 08:41.121
CLEANSING THE SOUL OF THE MAN

08:41.154 --> 08:44.057
WHO MURDERED YOUR SON.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.192
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:45.225 --> 08:49.129
- NO, BE NOT AFRAID,
BROTHER HATCH.

08:49.162 --> 08:53.801
YOU WITNESSED A SPIRITUAL EVENT
THAT DAY.

08:53.834 --> 08:58.138
VISIONS, REVELATIONS,

08:58.171 --> 09:01.008
SUBLIME TO WITNESS,

09:01.041 --> 09:05.012
YET DIFFICULT TO DISCERN.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.014
- HE'S TWISTING WHAT HAPPENED.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.083
- HE HAS A RIGHT TO SPEAK.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.052
YOU HAVE PROPOSED
THAT WE HANG HIM

09:12.085 --> 09:15.022
FOR IMPERSONATING A BISHOP.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.026
HEAVENLY FATHER DEMANDS
THERE BE NO DOUBT.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.161
- PRAISE GOD.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.097
- I TELEGRAPHED
THE MORMON CHURCH,

09:24.131 --> 09:28.101
FROM WHICH THE REAL BISHOP
JOINED US.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.738
A REPLY IS COMING
FROM BISHOP FINCH,

09:30.771 --> 09:32.039
THE HEAD OF THE WARD,

09:32.072 --> 09:36.009
THAT WILL PROVE THIS MAN...

09:36.043 --> 09:38.311
NEEDS JUSTICE.

09:38.345 --> 09:43.116
- INDEED,
AND MAY JUSTICE BE DONE.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.086
PRAISE GOD.
MM.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.723
[birds chirping]

09:51.191 --> 09:53.894
- WHOA.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.106
COME ON.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.066
[men shouting wildly]

10:36.770 --> 10:39.773
[arrow whooshes, horse neighs]

10:39.807 --> 10:42.843
[shouting continues]

11:12.205 --> 11:14.808
[horse neighs]

11:26.386 --> 11:28.221
[clicks tongue]

11:33.226 --> 11:36.129
[shushing]

12:09.797 --> 12:13.233
- HAVANA'S FINEST,
FROM MY PRIVATE STOCK.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.171
YOU AND I--
WE ARE BOTH MEN

12:18.205 --> 12:21.341
WITH EXPERIENCE ENOUGH TO KNOW
WHEN WE HAVE THE UPPER HAND.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.376
- AGREED.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.480
- SO LET ME SAY...

12:27.514 --> 12:30.951
I ADMIRE YOUR BOLD ACT
IN CLOSING THE CASINO.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.886
IT SHOWED STRENGTH.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.489
- THAT SITE IS PERFECT
FOR MY NEW FEDERAL OFFICES.

12:36.523 --> 12:41.494
THE DESIGNS FOR CAMPBELL PLAZA
ARE UNDER WAY.

12:41.528 --> 12:45.398
- YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT,
MR. CAMPBELL.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.368
BUT WE NEED HARD MEN
TO BUILD THE RAILROAD.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.038
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE,
THEY ARE NEVER MORE DANGEROUS

12:51.071 --> 12:52.205
THAN WHEN THEY ARE IDLE.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.442
NOW, MR. MCGINNES HAS PROVEN
HIMSELF ADEPT AT OFFERING

12:55.475 --> 12:59.346
THE RIGHT AMUSEMENTS
TO HELP MANAGE THE MEN.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.348
- YES.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.551
- YOU ARE IN A POSITION
TO BE MAGNANIMOUS.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.287
- WELL, HE ASSAULTED
A FEDERAL MARSHAL.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.256
- A RASH ACT
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.325
- HE'D BE SHOT FOR THAT OFFENSE
IN SOME STATES.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.361
- WELL,
LET'S BE GRATEFUL WYOMING

13:14.394 --> 13:18.265
HAS NOT YET ACHIEVED STATEHOOD.
[laughs]

13:18.298 --> 13:22.202
- THE MAYOR STAYS IN JAIL.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.378
THANK YOU FOR THE CIGARS.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.020
- HELLO?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.438
MRS. BOHANNON.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.975
I'M RUTH COLE.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.313
- THE CHURCH LADY.
- YES.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.050
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR MY BEHAVIOR THIS MORNING.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.320
IT WAS UNKIND.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.256
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

14:20.227 --> 14:24.497
SEVERAL WOMEN IN THE PARISH
DONATED THESE.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.935
YOU COULD MEET THEM
AT CHURCH TOMORROW.

14:27.935 --> 14:31.939
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER--
- BUT I AM...

14:31.939 --> 14:35.342
IN THE HEAVENLY FATHER
AND HIS TRUE PROPHET,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.445
JOSEPH SMITH.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.482
- I'LL ADMIT, I'M NOT
WELL VERSED IN MORMONISM.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.520
PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP ME
UNDERSTAND WHY JOSEPH SMITH

14:47.554 --> 14:50.357
ADVOCATED POLYGAMY,
FOR INSTANCE.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.460
- PLURAL MARRIAGE
IS GOD'S WILL.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.428
- GOD'S WILL?
- YES.

14:55.462 --> 14:59.099
THE LORD COMMANDS US
TO BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY

14:59.132 --> 15:03.103
SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THE KINGDOM
OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.338
- BUT THAT KINGDOM
IS PREDICATED

15:05.372 --> 15:07.340
ON THE EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN,

15:07.374 --> 15:08.641
FORCING THEM
TO SHARE HUSBANDS,

15:08.675 --> 15:11.111
REFUSING TO ALLOW THEM
TO BE ORDAINED AS CLERGY.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.281
YOU--YOU MUST SEE
THE INJUSTICE IN THAT.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.417
- I SEE CLARITY IN IT.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.586
I KNOW WHO I'M MEANT TO BE...

15:19.619 --> 15:21.488
A WOMAN
WHOSE PLACE IS IN THE HOME

15:21.521 --> 15:23.991
LOOKING AFTER HER CHILDREN.

15:26.693 --> 15:30.497
[train whistle blows
in the distance]

15:30.530 --> 15:34.134
- THE SERVICE IS AT 10:00.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.246
- SO...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.418
ABOUT WHAT TIME DO YOU EXPECT
MR. DURANT TO SWOOP IN HERE

15:51.451 --> 15:53.253
AND FREE YOU?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.488
HE IS YOUR PARTNER, RIGHT...

15:55.522 --> 15:58.325
THE ONE WHO RUNS THINGS
AROUND HERE?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.460
HMM.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.531
YEAH, I KNOW MEN LIKE HIM...

16:04.564 --> 16:07.434
BIG MEN.
KEEP YOU CLOSE--

16:07.467 --> 16:09.536
- QUIT YOUR YAPPING
AND GET ME A CUP OF WATER.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.438
- [chuckles]

16:11.471 --> 16:14.407
SURE THING, MR. MAYOR.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.449
[sighs]

16:22.482 --> 16:25.418
[groans]

16:28.221 --> 16:32.125
[grunting]

16:35.595 --> 16:37.630
WHEW!

16:40.567 --> 16:43.503
[grunts]

16:43.536 --> 16:47.474
THAT SHOULD HOLD YOU
TILL MR. DURANT GETS HERE.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.525
- WALLACE?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.629
IT'S A BAD SPOT FOR A CAMPFIRE.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.565
- GOVERNMENT TOOK THE CASINO.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.401
MICKEY'S IN JAIL.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.238
- I TAKE IT HE DIDN'T AGREE
WITH THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.766
- JUST HERE TO SEE MY FRIEND.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.609
I FIGURED YOU AND ME
ARE SQUARE.

17:58.711 --> 18:02.282
[chuckles]

18:02.315 --> 18:05.685
UH-UH.

18:05.718 --> 18:09.522
- YOU COME HERE TO
COMPARE BRUISES OR BUST ME OUT?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.424
- THE LATTER AIN'T UP TO ME
NO MORE.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
- YEAH.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.432
MR. DURANT'S WORKING
ON MY RELEASE, SO...

18:19.466 --> 18:21.468
- WOULDN'T COUNT ON THAT.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.636
DURANT DOES WHAT'S BEST
FOR DURANT.

18:23.670 --> 18:27.207
- [scoffs] THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP
WITH 40 ACRES

18:27.240 --> 18:29.409
OF WORTHLESS LAND
IN THE NORTH VALLEY.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.644
[chuckles]

18:35.515 --> 18:39.486
- SHIT, SON.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.354
COME HERE.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.627
WHEN I MET YOU...

18:47.660 --> 18:49.729
YOU DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING
BUT SOME CHEAP PAINTED GLASS

18:49.762 --> 18:53.433
AND STORIES OF HOME.

18:53.466 --> 18:57.270
AND YOU TURNED THAT
INTO A WHOREHOUSE AND A CASINO.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.674
YOU CAN DO THAT AGAIN.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.311
HELL WITH DURANT.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.879
- WITHOUT HIM,
I GOT NO LEVERAGE.

19:06.913 --> 19:10.383
- THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT SEAN THOUGHT.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.758
DON'T LEAVE ME
TO BURY YOU SIMILAR.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.827
OKAY?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.767
- ALL ABOARD!

19:27.800 --> 19:29.902
- YES, SIR.
HOW Y'ALL DOING?

19:29.936 --> 19:34.441
MICKEY'S, UH, EXPECTING YOU
TO GET HIM SPRUNG.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.676
- MICKEY NEEDS TO LEARN
TO CURB HIS TEMPER

19:36.709 --> 19:38.645
IF HE WANTS TO RUN A BUSINESS.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.613
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING...

19:40.647 --> 19:43.650
CASINO'S JUST THE START OF WHAT
CAMPBELL'S FIXING TO TAKE.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.552
PRETTY SOON
HE'LL COME FOR IT ALL.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.488
- CAMPBELL IS A BUREAUCRAT,
NOTHING MORE.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.823
- HE'S A CARPETBAGGER.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.693
FIRST THING THEY DID IN THE
SOUTH, REBUILD THE RAILROADS.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.763
NOW, ODDS ARE, HE'S GOT FRIENDS
HELPED HIM DO THAT,

19:56.796 --> 19:58.631
MEN JUST ITCHING TO DO IT AGAIN.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.933
NOW, HE KNOWS THAT
THERE'S MONEY IN IT AND POWER.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.503
- NO CARPETBAGGER
WILL TAKE MY RAILROAD.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.706
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.243
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT
A FARM BACK IN MISSISSIPPI.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.678
- HAVE YOU CONQUERED
SHERMAN PEAK YET?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.480
- WORKING ON IT.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.549
- GET MY RAILROAD MOVING,
MR. BOHANNON.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.761
- I'D LIKE YOU TO SIT
IN FRONT TOMORROW.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.833
AND TRY NOT TO TUG
AT YOUR SHIRT COLLAR.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.571
- I DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.811
- MONTHS OF SILENCE,
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY?

20:51.951 --> 20:56.756
I DOUBT THAT'S GOD'S PLAN
FOR YOU.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.758
YOU'RE NAUGHTY SOMETIMES,
BUT THAT--

20:58.791 --> 21:02.862
- I'M MORMON.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.032
[crying softly, sniffles]

21:07.867 --> 21:11.771
- WHERE ARE YOUR PEOPLE?

21:11.804 --> 21:15.575
- [crying]

21:20.847 --> 21:23.850
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.820
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.759
YOU'RE SAFE.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.727
- MR. DURANT!

21:34.761 --> 21:35.962
- AH, EVA.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.797
- YOU KNOW THAT STOCK
YOU GAVE ME LAST YEAR?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.432
- MM-HMM.
- HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?

21:39.466 --> 21:42.602
- VIRTUALLY NOTHING
AT THE MOMENT.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.903
- I SHOULD GO BACK TO WHORING.

21:43.936 --> 21:48.875
- IF IT'S MONEY YOU NEED,
LET ME HELP.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.911
- MR. DURANT, I CAN'T TAKE
NO CHARITY FROM YOU.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.080
- THINK OF IT AS A LOAN.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.984
- NO, I CAN'T.

22:05.925 --> 22:09.429
- CHURCH LADY STOPPED BY.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.931
- YEAH, AND--
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

22:11.964 --> 22:15.067
- THE CHURCH LADY.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.937
SHE INVITED US
TO SERVICES TOMORROW.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.839
- AND, UH...

22:19.872 --> 22:23.943
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.912
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE MORMONS.

22:25.945 --> 22:30.850
- I DOUBT SHE'S MET MANY
BEFORE YOU, BUT, UH...

22:30.883 --> 22:33.853
RUTH SPEAKS HER MIND,
BUT SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN,

22:33.886 --> 22:37.590
AND SHE CAN HELP YOU
MAKE YOUR WAY HERE.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.866
- THAT'S MY HUSBAND'S JOB.

22:46.899 --> 22:50.870
- [sighs]

22:50.903 --> 22:55.007
I'M PROVIDING
FOR YOU AND WILLIAM.

22:55.041 --> 22:58.678
- FATHER PROVIDED FOR ALL
OF HIS WIVES AND HIS CHILDREN,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.847
BUT HE STILL ATE WITH US,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.915
WORSHIPPED WITH US.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.156
MUCH LIKE THE LIFE THAT YOU HAD
WITH YOUR FIRST WIFE...

23:12.058 --> 23:15.528
BUT YOU LEFT
ALL OF THAT BEHIND.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.809
- [sighs]

23:36.716 --> 23:39.552
THERE WAS A WAR.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.602
- WAR'S OVER.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.983
- GET BACK INSIDE.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.087
GO ON.

24:21.761 --> 24:26.766
- YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU DID RIGHT
BY ME WITH THIS MARRIAGE.

24:26.799 --> 24:30.102
I'M GRATEFUL.
I AM.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.072
I GUESS...

24:33.105 --> 24:36.976
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT FAMILY LIFE WASN'T FOR YOU.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.758
- START WITH THE PEOPLE
CAMPBELL WORKED WITH IN ATLANTA.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.225
SEE IF ANY OF THEM
WERE RAILROAD MEN.

24:53.259 --> 24:57.029
OH, AND FIND OUT
WHAT INVOLVEMENT HE HAD

24:57.063 --> 24:59.966
IN THE RECONSTRUCTION
OF THE RAILROADS AFTER THE WAR.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.002
- YOU DO KNOW I HAVE
AN ENGINEERING DEGREE.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.937
- THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
THE INTELLIGENCE

25:04.971 --> 25:07.640
TO BE ABLE TO SEND
A FEW TELEGRAMS.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.111
THAT WILL BE ALL, DELANEY.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.747
AH, EVA!

25:16.883 --> 25:18.918
YOU CAME AROUND.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.090
- I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY,
MR. DURANT...

25:24.123 --> 25:25.858
FOR A POKE.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.827
- [coughs]

25:27.860 --> 25:29.962
[laughing]
NO, YOU MISUNDERSTAND!

25:29.996 --> 25:33.666
NO, I--THAT WAS NOT
A CONDITION OF MY OFFER.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.668
- [sighs] LOOK, I KNOW
I AIN'T SO PRETTY RIGHT NOW,

25:35.702 --> 25:37.136
BUT I CLEAN UP GOOD.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.838
- NO!
[stammers]

25:38.871 --> 25:40.673
EVA, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

25:40.707 --> 25:44.176
- WELL, THEN
WHY NOT TAKE A RIDE?

25:44.210 --> 25:46.112
IT'S NO TROUBLE.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.115
DON'T MEAN NOTHING TO ME
NO MORES, ANYWAY.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.619
- THAT, MY DEAR,
IS A TRAGEDY.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.627
- I LIKE YOU.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.766
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE ME.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.170
SO?

26:11.203 --> 26:13.072
COME ON.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.643
I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD PRICE.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.798
- LISTEN TO ME.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.199
YOU WILL TAKE MY MONEY.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.068
YOU ARE GOING
TO EAT MY FOOD.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.237
AND THEN YOU ARE GOING
TO GET INTO MY BATH,

26:45.271 --> 26:48.240
BECAUSE, TRUTH BE TOLD,
YOU ARE BEGINNING TO SMELL

26:48.274 --> 26:51.110
A LITTLE RIPE.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.113
- I...

26:54.146 --> 26:56.082
I CAN'T.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.952
- YOU CAN, AND YOU WILL.

26:59.986 --> 27:03.122
YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
I LIKE AROUND HERE.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.696
I'LL PAY YOU FOR THAT.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.907
[knock at door]
YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.075
- YEP.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.944
YOU CAN COME IN, IF YOU LIKE.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
- NO, I-I'M FINE.
- [chuckles]

27:27.179 --> 27:31.150
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

27:31.183 --> 27:34.286
DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.289
- BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.426
- I AIN'T NEVER HAD NO FRIENDS
WEREN'T CUSTOMERS.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.165
- THEIR LOSS.

27:49.168 --> 27:53.072
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
- OF COURSE.

27:59.145 --> 28:03.149
- DO YOU THINK ALL WOMEN
ARE WHORES?

28:03.182 --> 28:05.317
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

28:05.351 --> 28:08.888
- WELL...

28:08.921 --> 28:13.225
LAST TIME I WAS IN A BATH,
A MAN MADE CLEAR THAT OPINION.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.962
- [sighs]

28:15.995 --> 28:20.867
I CONSIDER WOMEN TO BE
GOD'S MOST GLORIOUS CREATURES.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.072
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO LOVE ONE.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.977
- YOUR WIFE?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.311
- NO.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.913
WELL--WELL...

28:33.946 --> 28:37.817
AT ONE TIME, MAYBE.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.887
BUT AFTER OUR BOY DIED, WE...

28:42.889 --> 28:46.125
WELL, WE WERE BUSINESS PARTNERS
AT BEST.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.397
WHEN I WAS IN JAIL,

28:51.430 --> 28:54.166
PENNILESS,

28:54.200 --> 28:56.235
SHE LEFT ME.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.037
- OH.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.339
HER LOSS.
- [chuckles]

29:00.372 --> 29:02.341
THANK YOU.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.979
- DON'T MAKE THE LOVE STOP.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.919
DOES IT GET ANY EASIER?

29:15.121 --> 29:17.356
- NO.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.960
INDEED, NO, IT DOES NOT.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.266
- [sighs]

29:29.301 --> 29:33.305
[rooster crows]

29:35.441 --> 29:37.309
- [groans]

29:39.445 --> 29:41.914
[sighs]

29:45.284 --> 29:49.221
- YOU DIDN'T COME TO BED.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.957
- WELL, I HAD WORK TO DO,

29:50.990 --> 29:54.326
AND I FIGURED
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME THERE.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.328
- OF COURSE I DO.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.368
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I HAD A FAMILY

30:02.401 --> 30:06.438
OTHER THAN THE RAILROAD.

30:06.472 --> 30:10.342
SO I FIGURED WE COULD GO
TO CHURCH THIS MORNING...

30:10.376 --> 30:14.180
TOGETHER,
IF YOU'RE WILLING.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.022
- I'D LIKE THAT.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.266
- I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING BEFORE SERVICE,

30:34.300 --> 30:36.235
ALL RIGHT?

30:40.406 --> 30:42.341
- * RUN, HENRY, RUN, YEAH

30:42.374 --> 30:46.578
* RUN, NATHAN, RUN, OH,

30:46.612 --> 30:48.347

30:48.380 --> 30:50.416
- * ALL GOD'S CHILDREN

30:50.449 --> 30:52.351
* YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

30:52.384 --> 30:54.520
* OH, CHILDREN,
YOU GOT A RIGHT *

30:54.553 --> 30:56.522
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

30:56.555 --> 30:58.958
- * HEBREW CHILDREN
GOT A RIGHT *

30:58.991 --> 31:00.592
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

31:00.626 --> 31:02.962
- * I'VE COME TO TELL YOU,
YOU GOT A RIGHT *

31:02.995 --> 31:04.964
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

31:04.997 --> 31:07.066
- * RUN, BOHANNON, RUN, I SAY

31:07.099 --> 31:09.035
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

31:09.068 --> 31:11.137
- * RUN, BOHANNON, RUN,
I TELL YA *

31:11.170 --> 31:13.139
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

31:13.172 --> 31:15.474
- * ALL GOD'S CHILDREN
GOT A RIGHT *

31:15.507 --> 31:17.376
all: * YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO THE TREE OF LIFE *

31:17.409 --> 31:20.980
- AMEN. ALL RIGHT.
[applause]

31:21.013 --> 31:22.548
- PSALMS.
- HOW YOU DOING THIS MORNING?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.350
- MORNING.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.318
SO LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.187
HOW MUCH TO GET A CREW
TOGETHER TODAY?

31:28.220 --> 31:31.090
- HOW MUCH YOU GOT?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.027
NO.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.029
CAN'T GET MORE
THAN TEN MEN FOR THAT,

31:37.063 --> 31:39.031
TWO HOURS, MOST.

31:39.065 --> 31:41.467
- ALL RIGHT, MEET YOU
AT THE GRADE AFTER CHURCH.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.369
- OH, BOYS BEEN HANKERING
FOR A GAME OF BASEBALL

31:43.402 --> 31:44.403
THIS AFTERNOON.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.439
YOU WANT A CREW,
GOT TO GO NOW.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.178
- UM...

31:52.211 --> 31:55.081
ALL RIGHT, PICK THE CREW.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.548
- FELLAS...

31:56.582 --> 31:59.085
I KNOW IT'S THE LORD'S DAY,
BUT WE'RE GONNA WORK.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.555
[door opens and closes]

32:03.589 --> 32:07.226
[footsteps approaching]

32:09.061 --> 32:11.430
- DURANT CAME BY
TO SEE ME YESTERDAY.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.431
HE ASKED FOR YOUR RELEASE.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.234
I TOLD HIM NO.

32:17.236 --> 32:21.007
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
THAT COULD FREE YOU TODAY.

32:21.007 --> 32:24.610
SIGN THIS PAPER
GIVING ME TITLE TO THE CASINO.

32:24.643 --> 32:28.080
I'LL PAY YOU
TO MANAGE THE PLACE.

32:28.114 --> 32:32.151
GRANTED, I COULD JUST STEAL
THE PROPERTY FROM YOU.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.087
- YOU ALREADY HAVE.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.093
- I PREFER
TO DO THINGS LEGALLY.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.338
- [sighs]

32:56.508 --> 32:59.445
- $200 FOR THE TITLE...

32:59.478 --> 33:01.613
SALARY FOR YOU.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.450
JESSUP WILL PICK UP
THE TAX EVERY WEEK.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.297
- SHOVE YOUR MONEY
UP YOUR ARSE.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.499
- COME NOW, MR. MCGINNES.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.500
YOU'RE A SMART MAN.

33:54.533 --> 33:58.537
- AYE.
AND A COMER TOO.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.307
I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
WITH NOTHING,

34:01.340 --> 34:04.410
AND I BUILT ME A FORTUNE.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.213
I'LL DO IT AGAIN...

34:07.246 --> 34:10.316
BEHOLDEN NOT
TO THE LIKES OF YOU

34:10.349 --> 34:12.218
OR TO THOMAS C. DURANT.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.657
- WE DAMN SURE CAN'T BLAST
THROUGH THIS MOUNTAIN.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.327
DURANT'S GIVEN UP
ON GOING AROUND.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.528
GOT NO CHOICE BUT OVER.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.697
- [scoffs] THAT BEATING YOU TOOK
DONE SCRAMBLED YOUR BRAIN.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.533
SURVEYORS DONE BEEN
ALL OVER THIS MOUNTAIN,

34:27.566 --> 34:28.667
AIN'T FOUND NOWHERE
THAT WASN'T TOO STEEP.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.502
- YEAH, I LOOKED AT THE NOTES.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.238
THERE WAS 6 FOOT OF SNOW
ON THE GROUND

34:32.271 --> 34:33.672
WHEN THEY WAS OUT HERE.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.675
I WAS UP TOP YESTERDAY,
SAW A WAY MIGHT WORK.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.444
- "MIGHT"?

34:38.477 --> 34:41.580
- IF WE CARVE A LEDGE
THE WIDTH OF A TRAIN TRACK

34:41.613 --> 34:44.550
ON THE MOUNTAIN'S OUTER EDGE.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.553
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

34:47.586 --> 34:49.255
SEE THAT CLIFF OVER YONDER?
- YEAH.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.557
- WE GONNA DIG A 2% GRADE
STRAIGHT FOR IT.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.526
WHEN I KNOW HOW FAR WE CAN GET
IN TWO HOURS,

34:54.560 --> 34:57.296
I CAN FIGURE HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE
A FULL CREW TO REACH THE SUMMIT.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.697
- COULD BE DURANT
AIN'T HAVE US TRY THIS

34:58.730 --> 35:01.467
'CAUSE HE KNOW IT'S CRAZY.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.537
- WELL, ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.590
- DID IT COME?

35:37.436 --> 35:41.407
[horse neighs,
rooster crows in the distance]

35:41.440 --> 35:44.276
THIS IS FROM BISHOP FINCH.

35:44.310 --> 35:49.615
IT SAYS BISHOP DUTSON
IS 5 FEET, 6 INCHES TALL,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.783
BROWN HAIR,

35:51.817 --> 35:55.487
PORTLY GIRTH.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.657
STAND UP.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.399
- [laughs]

36:09.935 --> 36:13.772
- YOU ARE NOT THE MAN
DESCRIBED IN THIS TELEGRAM.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.441
- NO.

36:15.474 --> 36:19.311
- YOU HAVE DECEIVED
THIS ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

36:19.345 --> 36:22.314
[cage clatters]
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE!

36:25.517 --> 36:28.654
- I AM...

36:28.687 --> 36:32.524
BISHOP JOSEPH DUTSON,

36:32.558 --> 36:36.462
AND I HAVE NEVER MET
BISHOP FINCH.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.697
- YOU PRAYED BESIDE HIM

36:38.730 --> 36:41.467
FOR THREE YEARS.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.834
THIS PROVES

36:42.868 --> 36:47.539
THAT YOU HAVE BORNE FALSE
WITNESS TO US ALL.

36:47.573 --> 36:51.677
- IT PROVES ONLY
THAT THE AUTHOR HAS LIED

36:51.710 --> 36:54.680
TO SUPPORT YOUR DELUSION.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.783
OR PERHAPS
YOU ARE THE AUTHOR,

36:57.816 --> 36:59.885
BROTHER HATCH.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.793
- I AM BRINGING THIS
TO THE ELDERS.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.429
- MM-HMM.

37:10.462 --> 37:13.499
- THEY WILL FIND YOU GUILTY

37:13.532 --> 37:15.567
AND SET YOU TO THE NOOSE.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.773
- ARE YOU SURE
THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY

37:21.807 --> 37:24.376
TO HANG A BISHOP?

37:25.477 --> 37:27.779
BECAUSE IF THEY DO NOT

37:27.813 --> 37:30.682
AND YOU ARE WRONG,

37:30.716 --> 37:33.519
THEN YOU WILL HANG,
BROTHER HATCH,

37:33.552 --> 37:37.456
AS WILL THE ELDERS.

37:37.489 --> 37:41.360
- WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY,
IF NOT THE ELDERS?

37:41.393 --> 37:45.364
- AN UNIMPEACHABLE MAN...

37:45.397 --> 37:49.368
THE LION OF THE LORD...

37:49.401 --> 37:53.405
OUR BROTHER BRIGHAM YOUNG.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.844
BRING HIM HERE.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.747
I WILL ABIDE BY HIS JUDGMENT.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.555
[exhales deeply]

38:09.588 --> 38:12.391
HMM.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.661
[church bell tolling]

38:15.694 --> 38:18.630
[organ music]

38:18.664 --> 38:26.538
*

38:58.937 --> 39:01.807
- THESE TOOLS ALL WRONG.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.709
THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.561
- THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME CONSECRATE

39:22.594 --> 39:25.964
THIS FINE HOUSE OF WORSHIP.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.966
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

39:27.999 --> 39:30.669
JESUS CHRIST IS ALIVE

39:30.702 --> 39:34.673
AND PRESENT IN THIS BUILDING.

39:34.706 --> 39:38.977
AND IF WE DO NOT ACCEPT HIM
AS OUR PERSONAL LORD AND SAVIOR,

39:39.010 --> 39:40.579
WE WILL BURN IN HELL.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.681
all: AMEN.

39:45.884 --> 39:50.021
- I SPEAK NOT OF THE INNOCENTS
AMONG US.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.590
THE LORD SAID,

39:51.623 --> 39:53.525
"SUFFER THE CHILDREN
TO COME UNTO ME.

39:53.559 --> 39:57.596
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
BELONGS TO SUCH AS THESE."

39:59.865 --> 40:02.033
NO, IT IS THOSE WHO TURN AWAY

40:02.067 --> 40:04.002
FROM THE TEACHINGS OF THE LORD

40:04.035 --> 40:07.138
WHO WILL SPEND ETERNITY
IN THE FIERY LAKE.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.041
FOR HE COMMANDS US
TO LOVE OUR GOD,

40:10.075 --> 40:13.011
AS WELL AS OUR NEIGHBOR.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.846
DO YOU LOVE YOUR GOD?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.881
all: YES.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.583
- DO YOU LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR?

40:17.616 --> 40:19.985
all: YES.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.854
- I DID NOT LOVE MY NEIGHBOR
THIS WEEK.

40:22.888 --> 40:26.091
I SAT IN JUDGMENT
ON MY FELLOW MAN.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.628
I REVELED IN THE PIT

40:29.661 --> 40:33.565
OF MY OWN SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS.

40:33.599 --> 40:37.903
SO I DESERVE TO BE CAST OUT
INTO DARKNESS,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.906
AND I DO NOT
DESERVE SALVATION.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.210
NONE OF US DOES.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.953
ONLY THE BLESSED MERCY

40:54.986 --> 40:58.890
OF JESUS CHRIST CAN SAVE US.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.793
[organ music]

41:01.827 --> 41:07.132

41:09.067 --> 41:12.137
- [sighs]

41:26.952 --> 41:29.988
- HEY, LITTLE MAN.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.159
[baby fussing]

41:34.192 --> 41:37.563
[grunts]

41:45.003 --> 41:48.139
- I WENT TO CHURCH.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.047
- [sighs]

41:58.149 --> 42:00.986
NAOMI...
- I KNOW.

42:02.153 --> 42:06.024
I'LL STOP ASKING.
