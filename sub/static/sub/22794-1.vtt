00:27.940 --> 00:30.370
♫ We sat beneath the stars at a fire

00:30.371 --> 00:32.418
♫ And played our new guitars

00:32.420 --> 00:36.800
♫ And I wondered how
long this was gonna last

00:36.801 --> 00:39.411
♫ Because picture perfect memories

00:39.412 --> 00:41.919
♫ Just come with all those tougher things

00:41.920 --> 00:46.087
♫ And pain's the best reminder of our past

00:46.968 --> 00:48.937
♫ I watched the meteors fall

00:48.938 --> 00:51.268
♫ On a world that hardly cared at all

00:51.269 --> 00:55.995
♫ Leaving silver trails
of dust across the sky

00:55.996 --> 00:58.337
♫ Of indigo blue that matched my mood

00:58.338 --> 01:00.847
♫ And with constellations for tattoos

01:00.848 --> 01:05.447
♫ And I watched them
fade away and quickly die

01:05.447 --> 01:10.108
♫ So many theories
wrong and soon disproved

01:10.109 --> 01:15.007
♫ So many ideas lost among the feud

01:15.008 --> 01:19.748
♫ So many conversations
that are sadly misconstrued

01:19.749 --> 01:22.054
♫ And lost among debate
and needless violence

01:24.008 --> 01:27.175
♫ We need the silence

01:35.765 --> 01:37.575
♫ We walked in a haunted place

01:37.576 --> 01:40.006
♫ With tattered walls and empty space

01:40.007 --> 01:44.985
♫ And a musty smell that
drenched the nighttime air

01:44.986 --> 01:47.062
♫ Neither of us said a word

01:47.063 --> 01:49.571
♫ And we waited till we heard the birds

01:49.572 --> 01:54.123
♫ And realized not once
had we ever been scared

01:54.124 --> 01:58.918
♫ So many theories
wrong and soon disproved

01:58.919 --> 02:03.558
♫ So many ideas lost among the feud

02:03.559 --> 02:08.485
♫ So many conversations
that are sadly misconstrued

02:08.485 --> 02:12.537
♫ And lost among debate
and needless violence

02:12.538 --> 02:13.845
♫ We need the silence

02:13.846 --> 02:15.035
- You think you can get to me, bitch?

02:15.036 --> 02:17.704
- He is the hottest guy in town.

02:29.092 --> 02:32.236
- Wow, that is so exciting!

02:55.414 --> 02:59.007
- Please, Lord, tell us what to do.

02:59.008 --> 03:00.327
Please be with Nella.

03:00.328 --> 03:02.583
Reach out your hand to her and embrace her

03:02.584 --> 03:06.256
with your big fatherly loving arms.

03:06.257 --> 03:07.507
And Jenny, God,

03:08.876 --> 03:13.826
eyes to see in this deep blindness.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.593
And Sarah, Lord, ears to hear in the midst

03:17.594 --> 03:20.738
of this chaotic noise.

03:20.739 --> 03:24.423
And please prepare David for
what he is about to endure...

03:24.424 --> 03:25.257
- Carly!

03:25.257 --> 03:26.257
Shut up!

03:27.276 --> 03:31.939
- And God, please spare Tammy
Jane from the depths of hell.

03:33.315 --> 03:34.148
- When I was a kid,

03:34.149 --> 03:35.768
I used to think that being 16

03:35.769 --> 03:38.012
would make me feel so grown up.

03:38.013 --> 03:40.748
Then when I was 16, I used
to think that being 21

03:40.749 --> 03:42.904
would mean I'd finally arrived.

03:42.905 --> 03:45.480
Now I'm 23, and I am starting to wonder

03:45.481 --> 03:48.340
if you ever reach a point
of feeling like a grown up.

03:50.995 --> 03:53.162
- Well, that was dramatic.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.787
Okay, so does anybody have any ideas?

03:56.788 --> 03:57.621
What do we do?

03:57.622 --> 03:59.814
Do we tell David?

03:59.815 --> 04:01.251
- Go

04:01.252 --> 04:02.252
to

04:04.837 --> 04:06.133
- That was a big one.

04:06.134 --> 04:07.795
- Okay, I've had enough of you two.

04:07.796 --> 04:09.733
I think we should just call Drew.

04:09.734 --> 04:11.261
- I think we should call David.

04:11.262 --> 04:12.262
- No!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.429
We can't tell him yet.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.497
- Why don't we have his fiance call him?

04:17.498 --> 04:20.137
- I think we should give Nella some space.

04:20.137 --> 04:22.721
You know, let go and let God...

04:24.506 --> 04:26.839
- Let God what?

04:27.786 --> 04:30.545
Thought so.

04:30.546 --> 04:32.141
- You know what, Jenny?

04:32.142 --> 04:33.866
I'm kind of hungry.

04:33.867 --> 04:36.066
How does pizza covered in mayonnaise

04:36.067 --> 04:37.916
with tuna fish sound to you?

04:37.917 --> 04:39.557
Cut it out!

04:39.558 --> 04:41.847
I think we should just call Drew.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.287
- Yeah, call your big brother.

04:44.288 --> 04:46.487
Any time, this is like the
time you pissed yourself

04:46.488 --> 04:48.051
in third grade.

04:48.052 --> 04:48.900
- Not really.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.535
- This is all my fault, you guys.

04:50.536 --> 04:51.747
I'm so sorry.

04:51.748 --> 04:53.539
I shouldn't have kept pushing Nella.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.344
I just,

04:55.345 --> 04:56.428
I got so mad.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.177
- Don't talk if you don't need to.

04:59.178 --> 05:00.011
It's not your fault.

05:00.012 --> 05:04.837
- Ignorance is
happiness or something, right?

05:05.672 --> 05:08.339
- Jen, this would have
come out at some point.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.935
Nella didn't need you
to bring it out in her.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.059
- Oh, yes, please tell us
something we don't already know,

05:14.060 --> 05:16.268
Miss I-have-a-4.0-at-Stanford.

05:16.269 --> 05:19.240
- Carly, what exactly do you have a 4.0 in

05:19.241 --> 05:21.451
besides Jesus camp?

05:21.452 --> 05:23.836
And I didn't see you trying
to keep Nella sober either.

05:23.837 --> 05:26.379
- Well, God didn't try to
keep Sodom and Gomorrah sober.

05:26.380 --> 05:27.984
He just destroyed them.

05:27.985 --> 05:30.304
- Sodom and Gomorrah were cities.

05:30.305 --> 05:32.724
You can't keep a cit sober, stupid.

05:32.725 --> 05:35.267
- You don't read the
Bible much, do you Carly?

05:35.268 --> 05:38.617
- Hey, TJ, if you were to die right now,

05:38.618 --> 05:40.018
where do you think you would go?

05:40.019 --> 05:40.935
- Anywhere you're not.

05:40.936 --> 05:42.510
- Oh, that would be hell,

05:42.511 --> 05:45.458
and I'm fairly certain
you don't mean that.

05:45.459 --> 05:47.866
- Oh, I look terrible.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.581
- Insinuating that you looked better

05:49.582 --> 05:51.486
before all that pizza and booze?

05:52.320 --> 05:53.153
Oh, gro...

05:53.154 --> 05:54.308
Ew!

05:54.309 --> 05:55.561
What is that thing?

05:55.562 --> 05:56.395
- This is stupid.

05:56.396 --> 05:57.812
I'm calling Drew.

06:02.326 --> 06:03.326
I quit.

06:04.957 --> 06:06.290
- No you didn't.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.364
- Three months' sober.

06:08.365 --> 06:09.805
- Ha-ha!

06:09.806 --> 06:13.139
You can quit when you go back to school.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.075
- I'll try.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.075
- Hmm.

06:20.851 --> 06:21.851
Hmm.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.398
When we were in high school,

06:42.399 --> 06:43.961
did you actually think we'd
stay friends with Nella?

06:43.962 --> 06:44.962
Be honest.

06:45.811 --> 06:49.811
- No, but I guess it's no surprise.

06:52.335 --> 06:54.777
- What happened to calling your brother?

06:54.778 --> 06:56.010
- Escape tactic.

06:56.011 --> 06:57.119
- Ha!

06:57.120 --> 06:58.620
I don't blame you.

07:00.332 --> 07:03.675
You think he'll be the
problem solver this time?

07:03.676 --> 07:04.995
- At this point, he might be the only one

07:04.996 --> 07:08.230
with enough motivation to try.

07:08.231 --> 07:09.703
I mean, he was pretty good at coaching you

07:09.704 --> 07:12.816
through your break-ups, wasn't he?

07:12.817 --> 07:14.232
- Is this a break-up?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.347
Is that what we're calling it?

07:16.348 --> 07:18.015
- Not yet, it isn't.

07:19.791 --> 07:21.671
- It was a friendship that
was not supposed to last

07:21.672 --> 07:23.178
past high school.

07:23.179 --> 07:27.346
And like a diseased rotten apple,

07:29.053 --> 07:31.136
she survived the harvest.

07:32.962 --> 07:35.701
Why were we even friends with
Nella in the first place?

07:35.702 --> 07:39.869
- What else do you do in a
dime-sized town called Willits?

07:41.334 --> 07:45.501
- Try not to get pregnant.

07:48.251 --> 07:50.168
- Why are you here, TJ?

07:51.213 --> 07:54.609
I mean, out of all of us,
you had the right to say no.

07:54.610 --> 07:57.163
Why did you agree to be a bridesmaid?

07:57.164 --> 07:58.640
- I don't know.

07:58.641 --> 08:01.444
I thought I was cool with everything.

08:01.445 --> 08:05.349
Besides, Nella did not
ask me to be a bridesmaid.

08:05.350 --> 08:07.267
David did, dun-dun-dun.

08:08.528 --> 08:09.528
- Shut up.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.634
Why would David agree to do that for her?

08:13.635 --> 08:17.506
- Why wouldn't
he do that for her?

08:17.507 --> 08:21.590
God, Sarah, it's because
she's got big nice tits.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.317
And after everything,

08:26.032 --> 08:29.045
she cheats on him the
night before their wedding

08:29.046 --> 08:32.879
and leaves all of us in
the cloud of her shit.

08:37.745 --> 08:38.745
Mic drop.

08:41.279 --> 08:43.111
Pick that mic back up.

08:43.986 --> 08:45.288
We're callin' Drew.

08:47.581 --> 08:49.067
Thanks for coming out so late.

08:49.068 --> 08:50.651
- Yeah, no problem.

08:53.243 --> 08:54.659
Hey, TJ.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.034
- Hey, Drew.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.202
Yeah, I knew he liked me.

08:58.203 --> 09:01.075
I caught on when he tried to
nickname me Bette Davis Eyes

09:01.076 --> 09:05.055
or when he told David I was
like a rock star's muse.

09:05.056 --> 09:06.815
He was drunk.

09:06.816 --> 09:09.248
So I try to keep him out
of trouble and play dumb,

09:09.249 --> 09:11.193
something I loathe doing.

09:11.194 --> 09:12.194
- So...

09:20.277 --> 09:24.071
Did someone have something they wanna say?

09:27.830 --> 09:29.965
- I was not super-drunk.

09:29.966 --> 09:30.916
I had a few...

09:30.916 --> 09:31.749
- None of us
- Whoa!

09:31.749 --> 09:32.582
Should even be here.
- Whoa! Whoa!

09:32.583 --> 09:33.668
- No one should show up tomorrow.

09:33.669 --> 09:34.669
- Hey!

09:35.819 --> 09:37.652
One at a time, please.

09:39.725 --> 09:40.725
Sarah.

09:43.036 --> 09:44.036
Carly.

09:45.131 --> 09:47.997
- We all met up at Nella's place.

09:47.998 --> 09:49.075
We picked her up.

09:49.076 --> 09:50.628
We had this big surprise party planned.

09:50.629 --> 09:54.270
It was gonna take all night, and then,

09:54.271 --> 09:57.177
hold on.

09:57.178 --> 09:59.488
- Okay, she's coming,
she's coming, she's coming.

09:59.489 --> 10:00.322
- All right, here we go.

10:00.322 --> 10:01.322
- Yay!

10:03.373 --> 10:04.206
- David!

10:04.206 --> 10:05.039
What are you doing here?
- Oh, forgive me.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.429
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.617
I'm leaving right now.
- You are not supposed

10:07.618 --> 10:10.939
to see her.
- If you'll just excuse me.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.157
I had to see my bride

10:12.158 --> 10:13.032
one last time before tomorrow...

10:13.032 --> 10:13.912
- It doesn't matter.

10:13.912 --> 10:14.745
You need to get.

10:14.746 --> 10:15.921
- All right, message received.

10:15.922 --> 10:17.660
You girls have some fun, be safe,

10:17.661 --> 10:19.320
and make sure that this
one cuts loose a little.

10:19.321 --> 10:21.365
- No, no, no thank you.

10:21.366 --> 10:22.818
- How you doin', Tammy Jane?

10:22.819 --> 10:24.285
- Fine.

10:24.286 --> 10:25.119
- Okay.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.040
You girls, be good.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.113
- Okay, let's keep focused on
who tonight is actually about,

10:29.114 --> 10:29.947
shall we?

10:29.948 --> 10:31.144
- Yeah, back to Nella.

10:31.145 --> 10:35.080
- My brother is marrying Nella, not you,

10:35.081 --> 10:39.248
so get over it.

10:40.405 --> 10:41.734
- Okay, did I need to hear that?

10:41.735 --> 10:43.244
- I would not say that!

10:43.245 --> 10:44.388
- How did you say it, then, Carly?

10:44.389 --> 10:45.574
- Jen.

10:45.575 --> 10:46.950
- Maybe TJ can help us?

10:46.951 --> 10:47.784
- No.

10:47.784 --> 10:48.617
- TJ said no.

10:48.618 --> 10:50.081
Jenny, move on.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.249
- After that, we went to the Golden...

10:55.400 --> 10:56.400
Wait.

10:58.128 --> 10:59.622
I'm good.

10:59.623 --> 11:02.359
We went to the Golden Brew.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.360
- And?

11:04.956 --> 11:05.789
- We drank.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.872
- They drank.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.967
- There she is!
- Ooh, come on!

11:09.968 --> 11:11.341
- Congratulations, pretty girl.

11:11.342 --> 11:12.687
You look gorgeous.
- Thank you!

11:12.688 --> 11:16.470
- Like
Cinderella, Nella was beautiful,

11:16.471 --> 11:18.563
the prettiest girl at the ball,

11:18.564 --> 11:22.599
a swervy goddess with a sneaky
little smile on her face.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.624
She always looked up to
no good and usually was.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.000
But even I have to admit,
there's an addiction

11:29.001 --> 11:30.726
to the kind of attention you get

11:30.727 --> 11:33.560
from a girl like Nella Kingsberry.

11:40.699 --> 11:41.756
- You okay?
- Yup.

11:41.757 --> 11:42.731
- Swear?
- I swear.

11:42.732 --> 11:44.675
- Oh, my gosh, my entourage
looks so beautiful!

11:44.676 --> 11:45.612
You guys, I'm so excited!

11:45.613 --> 11:47.051
I'm gonna be spoiled tonight, right?

11:47.052 --> 11:48.263
- Of course!
- Don't worry, princess.

11:48.264 --> 11:50.407
We have a Nella-spectacular night planned.

11:50.408 --> 11:52.483
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited!

11:52.484 --> 11:54.083
Oh, are we going to Amici's,

11:54.084 --> 11:55.570
because I hinted it way too many times

11:55.571 --> 11:56.943
for you guys to miss that.

11:56.944 --> 11:58.411
- I think you'll like what
we have planned better.

11:58.412 --> 11:59.535
You know, I know you.

11:59.536 --> 12:00.369
- Yes, you do.

12:00.369 --> 12:01.202
Oh, my gosh!

12:01.203 --> 12:02.251
Do you remember senior prom there?

12:02.252 --> 12:03.407
- Unfortunately.

12:03.408 --> 12:05.870
- That's where you got
your nickname.

12:05.871 --> 12:06.828
Memories.

12:06.828 --> 12:07.661
- Okay, get her!

12:07.661 --> 12:08.610
- Get what?

12:08.611 --> 12:09.719
Oh!

12:09.720 --> 12:10.553
No!

12:10.553 --> 12:11.386
Guys, no!

12:11.386 --> 12:12.219
This is not, no.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.680
I spent a lot of money on this outfit.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.440
- Nella, it's a rite of passage.

12:15.441 --> 12:16.473
You have to wear it.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.400
- Oh, my gosh, this looks terrible.

12:18.401 --> 12:19.969
I'm not promising at all.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.568
- Oh, you just wait.

12:22.766 --> 12:23.849
- Okay, fine.

12:28.662 --> 12:30.520
So why are we here?

12:30.521 --> 12:32.380
- Just a little pregame
before the big stuff.

12:32.381 --> 12:33.349
Calm down.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.931
- How long are we gonna be here?

12:34.932 --> 12:36.546
- All night, bitch.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.074
- Look, it is all going to be fun.

12:38.075 --> 12:40.552
I promise we have a
full night planned out.

12:40.553 --> 12:41.796
Don't be this way.

12:41.797 --> 12:42.630
- What way?

12:42.630 --> 12:43.527
Yeah.

12:43.527 --> 12:44.360
Okay, fine.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.193
I'm sorry.

12:45.194 --> 12:46.276
You're right.

12:48.552 --> 12:49.520
You know what?

12:49.521 --> 12:50.617
It's gonna be tons of fun.

12:50.618 --> 12:53.083
I'm gonna go get a drink.

12:53.084 --> 12:54.811
- Can I wait in the car?

13:04.205 --> 13:05.231
- Hey!

13:05.232 --> 13:08.198
Hot bartender, how about a round

13:08.199 --> 13:09.642
of oatmeal cookie shots for me

13:09.643 --> 13:12.643
and my super-cute ladies over there?

13:13.681 --> 13:15.801
- Hey, need some help, lover?

13:15.802 --> 13:17.329
- He's being a jerk.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.617
Forget him.

13:18.618 --> 13:20.559
- Hey, Brandon.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.026
- Hi, Nella.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.992
What can I do ya for?

13:23.993 --> 13:26.502
- Are you givin' my girl some problems?

13:26.503 --> 13:27.953
- Pretty good problem causer.

13:27.954 --> 13:31.905
- Well, I have a problem
that I need solved.

13:31.906 --> 13:33.466
- I'll give it a shot.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.214
- See, the thing
is I wanna get drunk.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.107
It's my bachelorette party,

13:36.108 --> 13:38.273
and I don't have a drink in my hand.

13:38.274 --> 13:40.485
- Maybe your girl shoulda told me that.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.704
I might have been a little nicer for ya.

13:42.705 --> 13:46.872
- Brandon, are you
gonna get me what I want?

13:50.340 --> 13:51.680
- Let's get a shot.

13:52.514 --> 13:53.422
I'm so excited!

13:53.423 --> 13:55.839
- Well, can we go to Amici's.

13:56.873 --> 13:57.873
Thank you.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.337
- You know when you get your second round.

14:02.338 --> 14:03.649
- Well, I actually have to be careful,

14:03.650 --> 14:07.317
because you know how I
get when I get drunk.

14:08.258 --> 14:09.675
- Don't tempt me.

14:11.690 --> 14:13.252
- The girl's getting married tomorrow,

14:13.253 --> 14:14.605
in case you cared.

14:14.606 --> 14:16.957
- A girl's gotta enjoy
her last night of freedom.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.720
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:19.721 --> 14:22.008
You're disgusting.

14:22.009 --> 14:24.240
- I didn't hear any complaining
from you the other night.

14:24.241 --> 14:25.241
- Fuck you.

14:27.397 --> 14:28.230
- Wait a second.

14:28.231 --> 14:29.247
Do I know Brandon?

14:29.248 --> 14:30.546
- You know Brandon.

14:30.547 --> 14:32.812
Brandon Scott from high school.

14:32.813 --> 14:33.693
- Oh, God.

14:33.694 --> 14:35.453
That was Brandon Scott?

14:35.454 --> 14:36.882
- I heard he's been selling drugs.

14:36.883 --> 14:38.633
- I heard he once slept with his cousin.

14:38.634 --> 14:40.358
- I heard that you watch porn.

14:40.359 --> 14:41.307
- No, I do not!

14:41.307 --> 14:42.204
That is disgusting!

14:42.204 --> 14:43.037
No, I don't...
- Okay,

14:43.038 --> 14:44.469
can we get to the part
where it became necessary

14:44.470 --> 14:47.086
to call me at three a.m.?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.726
- May you and David live
a long and happy life

14:49.727 --> 14:53.137
full of laughter and loyalty and love.

14:53.138 --> 14:54.490
- Yay, cheers!

14:54.491 --> 14:55.701
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

14:55.702 --> 14:56.702
Here we go!

15:00.805 --> 15:02.392
Yummy!

15:02.393 --> 15:03.452
- Oh, my God!
- What?

15:03.453 --> 15:05.036
- This is the song.

15:06.432 --> 15:08.014
- Oh!
- Cheer squad, take it away!

15:08.015 --> 15:08.848
- A cheer song?

15:08.849 --> 15:09.967
I'm not doing this song.

15:09.968 --> 15:10.851
- It still works, you remember?

15:10.851 --> 15:11.684
- I don't remember.

15:11.685 --> 15:12.774
- Oh, come on, come on.

15:12.775 --> 15:14.381
You, hurry up, come here!

15:14.382 --> 15:16.448
- Okay, I'm here.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.977
- Five, six, seven, eight.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.394
Right!

15:31.053 --> 15:31.886
- Oh, my God!

15:31.887 --> 15:33.592
I can't believe I remembered everything.

15:33.593 --> 15:35.044
- So embarrassing, right?

15:35.045 --> 15:36.363
- So wait, BFFs forever, right?

15:36.364 --> 15:37.197
- Of course.

15:37.198 --> 15:38.208
- Promise?

15:38.209 --> 15:39.042
- Why?

15:39.043 --> 15:43.507
- Okay, I have to pee, hold on!

15:43.508 --> 15:44.936
- You remember that one time you fell?

15:44.937 --> 15:45.770
- Oh, yeah.

15:45.771 --> 15:47.880
That was really funny.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.702
- When I called, they said
it was just beer and wine,

15:50.703 --> 15:54.911
and now everyone's
getting stupid and drunk.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.924
- You know what you need?

15:56.925 --> 15:57.793
You need to get laid.

15:57.794 --> 15:59.113
- No!

15:59.114 --> 16:01.056
No, no I don't!

16:03.779 --> 16:06.110
- Cool story, Jenny.

16:06.111 --> 16:07.606
- Looking for your whore friend?

16:07.607 --> 16:09.202
- Excuse me?

16:09.203 --> 16:11.806
- Your friend with the
diamond ring on her finger?

16:11.807 --> 16:15.306
I'm guessing my bartender
isn't her fiance.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.131
- What are you talking about?

16:17.132 --> 16:18.902
- Check the men's bathroom.

16:18.903 --> 16:20.408
Oh, and good luck with that one.

16:20.409 --> 16:22.712
If I were you, I'd get some new friends.

16:28.510 --> 16:29.510
- Hey!

16:30.305 --> 16:32.141
Come dance with me.

16:32.142 --> 16:33.340
- No!

16:33.341 --> 16:34.242
- Come on!

16:34.243 --> 16:37.342
Being a bridesmaid is a great
way to find a new boyfriend.

16:37.343 --> 16:40.380
- No!

16:40.381 --> 16:41.997
- Okay, okay.

16:41.998 --> 16:45.081
Well, I'm just gonna go fishing then.

16:46.321 --> 16:48.793
I've got my fishin' pole,

16:48.794 --> 16:52.211
and I've got my eyes on a beautiful fish.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.032
Okay, let's try that again.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.257
You're a beautiful fish.

17:02.258 --> 17:03.258
Say it!

17:05.502 --> 17:06.792
- I'm a beautiful fish.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.905
- Say it louder.

17:08.906 --> 17:10.676
- I'm a beautiful fish!

17:10.678 --> 17:14.032
- The most beautiful fish in the sea!

17:28.194 --> 17:29.309
- Nella!

17:29.310 --> 17:30.143
- Get out!
- You're a bitch!

17:30.143 --> 17:30.976
- What the hell is going on in here?

17:30.976 --> 17:31.809
Shut up, I will handle this!

17:31.810 --> 17:32.928
- The ladies room's the other way.

17:32.929 --> 17:34.835
- Jenny, just listen to me.

17:34.836 --> 17:35.669
Jenny, it's not what it looks like...

17:35.669 --> 17:36.566
- Wait a minute.

17:36.567 --> 17:38.716
- Oh, it's not?
- Jenny, from calculus?

17:38.717 --> 17:39.550
- Yeah.

17:39.551 --> 17:40.595
- Wow!

17:40.596 --> 17:41.709
You've really blossomed.

17:41.710 --> 17:42.722
- Shut up.

17:42.723 --> 17:44.099
- You didn't make it to calculus.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.606
- I, yeah, I did.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.343
- The point is that
Brandon here was showing me

17:48.344 --> 17:49.663
this really cool beer that I wanted.

17:49.664 --> 17:52.591
It's a limited edition
that's not on the menu,

17:52.592 --> 17:53.425
right Brandon?

17:53.426 --> 17:55.838
- Yeah, the Blueberry Pumpkin Hefeweizen.

17:55.839 --> 17:56.961
- The Blueberry Pumpkin whatever, listen,

17:56.962 --> 17:59.458
and he was showing me how to tap the keg,

17:59.459 --> 18:00.292
so I was here.

18:00.292 --> 18:01.125
- Tap the keg?

18:01.126 --> 18:02.329
Is that what we're callin' it?

18:02.330 --> 18:03.507
- Well, he's gonna go do that.

18:03.508 --> 18:04.341
Go do that.
- You know,

18:04.341 --> 18:05.196
I'll just,
- Go ahead and do that.

18:05.196 --> 18:06.096
- I'll just go ahead and tap it myself.

18:06.097 --> 18:08.954
- Yeah, go!

18:08.955 --> 18:09.788
Jenny, listen.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.100
- Nella, you need to
explain yourself right now.

18:11.101 --> 18:15.236
- If you think you saw
something, trust me,

18:15.237 --> 18:16.826
you didn't.

18:16.827 --> 18:17.707
- Oh, please, Nella.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.434
- Trust me, you didn't.

18:20.435 --> 18:21.852
- Now you say it.

18:23.612 --> 18:27.112
- I thought I saw something, but I didn't.

18:28.343 --> 18:29.385
- Great.

18:29.386 --> 18:30.312
You know, the funny thing is

18:30.313 --> 18:33.345
that there are so many girls out there

18:33.346 --> 18:36.142
that are just dying to be my bridesmaids,

18:36.143 --> 18:38.771
and honestly, I could have
had you replaced like that.

18:39.784 --> 18:41.777
But I didn't, so...

18:41.778 --> 18:42.766
Make sense?

18:42.766 --> 18:43.766
Okay, good.

18:44.432 --> 18:45.308
Let's go, have a shot!

18:45.309 --> 18:47.762
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

18:47.763 --> 18:48.743
Fuck!

18:48.744 --> 18:50.975
- I should have said something
right then, you guys.

18:50.976 --> 18:51.809
I'm sorry.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.450
I just...

18:53.451 --> 18:54.431
Nella made that face she makes

18:54.432 --> 18:56.255
when she's about to
suck out a child's soul,

18:56.256 --> 18:59.382
and I just wussed out.

18:59.383 --> 19:00.606
- We all know that face.

19:00.607 --> 19:04.850
- I just wish that I had
been the one to find her.

19:04.851 --> 19:07.282
I felt God calling me to follow her,

19:07.283 --> 19:08.482
and then I didn't.

19:08.483 --> 19:09.699
- Please enlighten us, Carly,

19:09.700 --> 19:12.847
and tell us how you finding
her would've changed anything.

19:12.848 --> 19:15.718
- Well, I would have
confronted her with God's love.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.282
I wouldn't have wussed out.

19:17.283 --> 19:19.016
I wouldn't have failed her.

19:19.017 --> 19:21.802
- Nella didn't even want
you in this wedding.

19:21.803 --> 19:24.331
You're the obligatory family addition.

19:24.332 --> 19:27.832
- At least I'm not the boring party favor.

19:29.503 --> 19:33.582
- Well, if that isn't God's
love, I don't know what is.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.902
- Enough!

19:34.903 --> 19:35.903
God!

19:36.775 --> 19:38.596
- This is fun.

19:38.597 --> 19:40.514
Is there any more beer?

19:48.884 --> 19:50.446
- Teej, tell me what happened next.

19:50.447 --> 19:51.887
- I think we should call David.

19:51.888 --> 19:52.721
- No!

19:52.722 --> 19:54.434
- I would like to voice my side of things.

19:54.435 --> 19:55.435
- Overruled.

19:57.735 --> 19:59.652
- If I did 30 crunches,

20:03.055 --> 20:04.144
20 push-ups,

20:04.145 --> 20:07.133
I ran, ran three miles.

20:36.325 --> 20:37.805
Hey, hey David.

20:37.806 --> 20:39.465
- Why's Carly even here?

20:39.466 --> 20:40.596
- Because it's her brother.

20:40.597 --> 20:41.430
Cut her a break.

20:41.430 --> 20:42.263
She's still a kid.

20:42.264 --> 20:43.734
- Stop covering for her, Sarah.

20:43.735 --> 20:45.837
It's like you're trying to work
out some kind of repentance.

20:45.838 --> 20:46.869
- I'm probably half the reason

20:46.870 --> 20:48.498
that she is the way that she is.

20:48.499 --> 20:49.335
- A bitch?

20:49.336 --> 20:53.502
- Okay, can we just get
back to the story, please?

20:54.527 --> 20:55.527
TJ.

20:57.562 --> 20:58.706
- We brought her here.

20:58.707 --> 21:00.234
It was supposed to be a surprise.

21:00.235 --> 21:02.985
Everything seemed normal until...

21:04.823 --> 21:06.253
- Okay, okay, okay, no...

21:06.254 --> 21:07.100
- Okay, ready?

21:07.100 --> 21:07.933
- Okay.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.350
- Surprise!

21:11.446 --> 21:12.532
- Oh, my gosh.

21:12.533 --> 21:13.700
Guys, this is,

21:14.852 --> 21:15.685
this is awesome!

21:15.686 --> 21:17.035
This is so cute!

21:17.036 --> 21:17.869
Is this for me?

21:17.869 --> 21:18.702
Oh, my gosh.

21:18.702 --> 21:19.535
Thank you.

21:19.536 --> 21:20.777
Is this handmade?

21:20.778 --> 21:22.353
Wow, I love it.

21:22.354 --> 21:23.223
- Drinks, anyone?

21:23.224 --> 21:25.378
- Yes, drinks,
let's get those going.

21:25.379 --> 21:27.710
- We have pizza and Chiclets for later.

21:27.711 --> 21:28.918
Nella, you have the bed, of course,

21:28.919 --> 21:31.042
and the rest of us will
just crash wherever.

21:31.043 --> 21:32.742
- I'm not staying here.

21:32.743 --> 21:34.205
- Wait, what?

21:34.206 --> 21:36.789
- I'm not staying here tonight.

21:38.022 --> 21:39.045
I'm getting married in the morning,

21:39.046 --> 21:40.837
and I have to be up early, so I just...

21:40.838 --> 21:42.322
- I'm sorry.

21:42.323 --> 21:43.665
We just, we thought you'd be excited.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.325
We wanted to do something
special for you, Nells.

21:45.326 --> 21:46.159
- Yeah, no, no.

21:46.159 --> 21:47.144
My gosh, are you kidding me?

21:47.145 --> 21:48.288
I'm so grateful.

21:48.289 --> 21:50.057
I love this stuff.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.004
I just, I can't stay the night.

21:52.005 --> 21:54.512
Ha!

21:54.513 --> 21:55.832
- You know what?

21:55.833 --> 21:56.976
I will do this.

21:56.977 --> 22:00.540
Okay, how about I stay
around midnight-ish,

22:00.541 --> 22:02.488
party it up, get crunk,

22:02.489 --> 22:05.228
and then someone takes me home.

22:05.229 --> 22:06.918
- Are you okay?

22:06.919 --> 22:08.132
Did somebody upset you?

22:08.133 --> 22:09.293
You know, we didn't mean to upset you.

22:09.294 --> 22:10.127
- No!

22:10.127 --> 22:10.960
Are you kidding me?

22:10.961 --> 22:12.448
No, I'm just, it's nothing.

22:12.449 --> 22:14.580
It's just, you know what?

22:14.581 --> 22:16.162
It's stress.

22:16.163 --> 22:17.560
It's stress from the wedding.

22:17.561 --> 22:18.650
- Okay.
- And I'm just

22:18.651 --> 22:20.500
a little jittery, but I'm fine.

22:20.501 --> 22:22.851
I promise, I'm not Bridezilla or anything.

22:22.852 --> 22:26.791
- Did you wanna pray before
everybody starts drinking?

22:26.792 --> 22:28.659
I just, I know how this
whole crowd can get.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.725
- How does this crowd get?

22:30.726 --> 22:31.559
- You know what?

22:31.560 --> 22:32.791
Why don't you go outside and pray

22:32.792 --> 22:33.911
where God might here you?

22:33.912 --> 22:34.745
- Okay, fine.

22:34.746 --> 22:36.279
I'll take you home at midnight, Nella.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.863
TJ will monitor the drinking.
- Great.

22:37.864 --> 22:39.227
- Carly, I wouldn't waste your breath,

22:39.228 --> 22:41.098
as there's not much of
a hope in hell anyways.

22:41.099 --> 22:42.329
All right!

22:42.330 --> 22:43.683
Party time!
- Whoo-hoo!

22:43.684 --> 22:47.166
- TJ, drink monitor, get us some drinks.

22:47.167 --> 22:49.757
Strong with double...
- Mmm.

22:49.758 --> 22:52.359
- I need to talk to you.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.360
- What?

22:54.335 --> 22:58.063
- When we were at the bar,
Nella was gone for a long time.

22:58.064 --> 23:00.450
I went looking for her,

23:00.451 --> 23:04.618
and I found her in the
bathroom with that bartender.

23:07.462 --> 23:08.793
- What do you mean?

23:08.794 --> 23:12.666
- I found them together in the bathroom.

23:12.667 --> 23:13.791
They were hooking up, TJ.

23:13.792 --> 23:14.625
- Shut up!

23:14.625 --> 23:15.458
- Hello?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.291
Can I get drinks?

23:16.292 --> 23:18.041
Where are the drinks?

23:19.851 --> 23:21.684
- Here are her drinks.

23:23.024 --> 23:25.437
- Can we get the drinks, though, today?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.605
Oh, thank you!

23:27.460 --> 23:29.230
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

23:29.231 --> 23:30.650
Yummy, thank you!

23:30.651 --> 23:33.446
- Okay, so to Nella and David.

23:33.447 --> 23:34.287
- Oh, hold on.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.422
This one's for me, because you're my DD.

23:36.423 --> 23:37.566
- Ha!

23:37.567 --> 23:39.005
- So cheers!

23:39.006 --> 23:40.074
- Cheers!

23:42.978 --> 23:43.978
- Whoo!

23:58.239 --> 23:59.294
- Here we go.

24:12.155 --> 24:13.572
- I want a drink!

24:17.233 --> 24:18.066
Hold up!

24:18.067 --> 24:19.316
I need a drink!

24:22.174 --> 24:23.174
- Ew!

24:37.201 --> 24:38.419
♫ I'm a mis, I'm a mis,

24:38.420 --> 24:39.815
♫ I'm a misfit

24:39.816 --> 24:41.179
♫ I'm a mis, I'm a mis,

24:41.180 --> 24:42.355
♫ I'm a misfit

24:42.356 --> 24:43.787
♫ You're a mis, you're a mis

24:43.788 --> 24:45.114
♫ You're a misfit

24:45.115 --> 24:46.435
♫ I'm a mis, I'm a mis,

24:46.436 --> 24:49.495
♫ I'm a misfit

24:49.496 --> 24:54.003
- Come on, let's go.

24:54.004 --> 24:56.315
Oh, it's boring.

24:56.316 --> 24:57.288
- What is?

24:57.289 --> 24:58.651
- The party.

24:58.652 --> 25:01.007
I mean, Sarah's not very good
at pulling a party together.

25:01.008 --> 25:03.491
That's why she had me in high school.

25:03.492 --> 25:05.140
Hey, can I bum one of those?

25:05.141 --> 25:06.378
- It's my lucky one.

25:06.379 --> 25:10.469
- Yeah, you need it.

25:10.470 --> 25:13.397
This is pathetic.

25:13.398 --> 25:15.740
- What's pathetic, Nella?

25:15.741 --> 25:16.908
- Oh, come on.

25:18.071 --> 25:19.170
Fine.

25:19.171 --> 25:21.743
Okay, let's start with Carly.

25:21.744 --> 25:26.145
How tight do you thing
her panties are right now?

25:28.754 --> 25:30.709
Well, at least she's your problem now.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.427
- Lucky me.

25:32.428 --> 25:33.428
- Yeah.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.279
You know, I never said, "Thank you."

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
- For what?

25:39.370 --> 25:43.166
- For being so understanding

25:43.167 --> 25:45.917
about the whole thing with David.

25:47.487 --> 25:50.269
- I didn't do it for you.

25:50.270 --> 25:51.195
- It's just funny.

25:51.196 --> 25:53.426
It's just funny how
things work out, isn't it?

25:53.427 --> 25:55.034
It is.

25:55.035 --> 25:58.178
If I were you, I would feel very lucky

25:58.179 --> 26:00.522
that I didn't have other
problems to deal with, you know?

26:00.523 --> 26:02.666
I think we should cheers.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.503
Cheers to you not worrying
about that whole baby thing

26:05.504 --> 26:07.366
or it being my problem
or anything like that.

26:07.367 --> 26:10.014
Am I right?

26:10.015 --> 26:10.848
- You didn't know.

26:10.849 --> 26:12.252
I'm so sorry...
- It doesn't matter.

26:12.253 --> 26:13.753
- What baby thing?

26:16.773 --> 26:19.190
You murdered an unborn child?

26:20.050 --> 26:21.069
- Whoa!
- It was a miscarriage,

26:21.070 --> 26:21.903
you dip-shit.

26:21.904 --> 26:24.129
Keep your mouth closed,
or so help me, God.

26:24.130 --> 26:26.529
- A miscarriage due to
smoking and drinking

26:26.530 --> 26:27.825
might as well be an abortion.

26:28.938 --> 26:29.794
- Whoa!

26:29.794 --> 26:30.794
Stop it!

26:33.844 --> 26:35.549
Is that it?

26:35.550 --> 26:37.465
Is there no more?

26:37.466 --> 26:39.741
Please say there's no more.

26:39.742 --> 26:42.721
- I mean, we are
both very lucky girls.

26:42.722 --> 26:45.370
Right?

26:45.371 --> 26:49.553
- Hey, TJ, Sarah wants you for something.

26:49.554 --> 26:50.961
- What?

26:58.121 --> 26:59.288
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

27:00.275 --> 27:02.926
Shots, that's my girl.

27:02.927 --> 27:05.669
- You know I want one, a little something.

27:05.670 --> 27:06.503
- Perfect.

27:06.503 --> 27:07.442
- Mm-hmm.

27:07.443 --> 27:08.574
- Cheers.

27:08.575 --> 27:09.575
- Cheers.

27:11.450 --> 27:12.450
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.506
Yum.
- Yummy!

27:16.507 --> 27:17.429
Can I ask you a question?

27:17.429 --> 27:18.262
- Mm-hmm.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.762
- Was I a bitch in high school.

27:20.763 --> 27:22.008
- Oh, Nella.

27:22.009 --> 27:22.846
- Yes?

27:22.847 --> 27:24.694
- You totally still are.

27:24.695 --> 27:25.528
- What?

27:25.529 --> 27:27.322
- Yeah, you know you love it.

27:27.323 --> 27:29.066
- Yeah, I kinda do.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.242
- Okay, I have a question.

27:30.243 --> 27:31.650
- Okay.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.894
- What is the dealio with Brandon?

27:34.895 --> 27:38.214
Hotty with a body.
- Whoa-oh-ho-ho-ho, yes!

27:38.215 --> 27:39.215
- Brando?

27:39.943 --> 27:42.966
Is this like a one-night
stand kind of thing

27:42.967 --> 27:45.290
or a sizzlin' hot affair?

27:45.291 --> 27:47.718
- It's, can I tell you, girl?

27:47.719 --> 27:49.126
I'm gonna tell you all the details.

27:49.127 --> 27:50.350
- Oh, yes!

27:50.351 --> 27:52.938
Only if it's really dirty, though.

27:52.939 --> 27:55.645
- Eight-and-a-half inches.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.072
- Ho-ho-ho, wow!

27:58.073 --> 27:59.163
- You know what I'm
talkin' about?

27:59.164 --> 28:00.247
- I do, yeah.

28:01.121 --> 28:02.045
- Do you know what I'm talking about?

28:02.046 --> 28:03.485
- Yes, I know what you're talking about.

28:03.486 --> 28:04.837
- You a virgin?

28:04.838 --> 28:05.671
- Nella, you know that I had...

28:05.671 --> 28:06.504
- Oh, my gosh!

28:06.505 --> 28:07.515
That's so freaking cute!

28:07.516 --> 28:10.000
Oh, it's so sweet you're so innocent.

28:10.001 --> 28:11.903
You're a virgin.

28:11.904 --> 28:13.487
- No.

28:13.488 --> 28:16.435
- Yeah, you're gonna pour another one,

28:16.436 --> 28:17.588
and let's celebrate to that.

28:17.589 --> 28:19.052
You're a virgin, so cute.

28:19.053 --> 28:20.218
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

28:20.219 --> 28:22.836
and because I'm just so innocent,

28:22.837 --> 28:24.883
I think I'm gonna need
a better description.

28:24.884 --> 28:26.492
You know, more details.

28:26.493 --> 28:30.288
- Okay, well, let me
start by saying eight.

28:30.289 --> 28:31.860
- And-a-half inches.

28:31.861 --> 28:33.324
- Yeah.
- He's amazing.

28:33.325 --> 28:34.711
- I got it.

28:34.712 --> 28:38.167
Mmm, mmm, the question is

28:38.168 --> 28:39.094
what has he been doing with it?

28:39.095 --> 28:40.702
- Oh, my God.

28:40.703 --> 28:43.318
What has he not been doing with it.

28:43.319 --> 28:44.224
- Wow.
- I mean,

28:44.225 --> 28:48.391
like, things I can't even
describe, really.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.712
I get everything.

28:50.713 --> 28:51.546
Yeah.

28:51.547 --> 28:52.584
- So dirty.

28:52.585 --> 28:53.418
- I know.

28:53.419 --> 28:55.048
- I bet even dirtier, though.

28:55.049 --> 28:56.764
How many times?

28:56.765 --> 28:57.598
- A day?

28:57.598 --> 28:58.431
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

28:58.431 --> 28:59.264
A lot.

28:59.265 --> 29:00.387
We have a lot of sex.

29:00.388 --> 29:02.072
He's so hot.
- Oh.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.888
And David has no idea.

29:03.889 --> 29:04.757
- What?

29:04.758 --> 29:06.015
- David, he doesn't know, like...

29:06.016 --> 29:08.315
Oops!

29:10.977 --> 29:12.703
You're so sneaky.

29:12.704 --> 29:14.450
This is your dirty
little secret, Nell-Nell.

29:14.451 --> 29:15.452
- Yeah.

29:15.453 --> 29:18.091
Oh, Jenny, you're so bad, I love it!

29:20.448 --> 29:21.281
- Hey girls.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.114
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:22.115 --> 29:23.395
- What's the gossip?

29:23.396 --> 29:25.567
- We're talking about boys,

29:25.568 --> 29:28.218
and I think we should invite them over.

29:28.219 --> 29:29.219
- Uh, no.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.479
- Ah, I can't unhear those words.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.567
- And you guys know I'm not a virgin.

29:34.568 --> 29:35.448
I don't know what came over me.

29:35.449 --> 29:39.815
I just got so mad that I
zeroed in for the kill.

29:39.816 --> 29:40.816
I'm sorry.

29:41.552 --> 29:43.643
- You don't have to apologize.

29:43.644 --> 29:45.598
- I mean, is it so terrible that I was mad

29:45.599 --> 29:47.315
that she didn't want me
to be her bridesmaid?

29:47.316 --> 29:50.615
- She didn't want any of
us to be her bridesmaids.

29:50.616 --> 29:51.449
Oh, come on!

29:51.450 --> 29:53.244
Even I knew that.

29:53.245 --> 29:54.839
You can persecute me all you want,

29:54.840 --> 29:56.687
but Nella chose each and every one of you,

29:56.688 --> 29:59.187
because you are just like her.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.683
- If you're so disgusted with us, Carly,

30:00.684 --> 30:02.331
why are you still here?

30:02.332 --> 30:03.431
Why don't you leave?

30:03.432 --> 30:05.190
- Guys, Carly is right.

30:05.191 --> 30:06.291
- Oh, come on, Sarah.

30:06.292 --> 30:07.775
- Think about it.

30:07.776 --> 30:10.415
When has Nella truly ever
wanted to be our friend

30:10.416 --> 30:12.835
when she wasn't asking
for something in exchange

30:12.836 --> 30:16.774
or using you to make her more popular?

30:16.775 --> 30:19.557
- Or using you to bring her grades up?

30:19.558 --> 30:23.276
That was the only reason
she came over after school.

30:23.277 --> 30:25.880
It was our little secret.

30:25.881 --> 30:29.044
I had a secret with Nella Kingsberry.

30:29.045 --> 30:31.407
- I was her project.

30:31.408 --> 30:33.224
She made sure I was on
the cool side of the table

30:33.225 --> 30:35.600
as long as I kept pot in her pocket

30:35.601 --> 30:38.669
so she looked cool at parties.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.993
And she used me as a wing man, ironically,

30:41.994 --> 30:44.827
for all the guys she knew I liked.

30:45.976 --> 30:48.794
- I did awful things
with her in high school.

30:48.795 --> 30:52.993
I wasted so much time
being her partner in crime.

30:52.994 --> 30:55.545
I said terrible things to people.

30:55.546 --> 30:58.713
- But you're not those people anymore.

31:00.148 --> 31:03.036
High school is over, guys,
and no one wants to live

31:03.037 --> 31:07.189
the rest of their lives
being remembered like that.

31:07.190 --> 31:10.261
Look, I know that we live in a small town

31:10.262 --> 31:12.507
and that everywhere we look feels like

31:12.508 --> 31:13.848
an extension of high school,

31:13.849 --> 31:17.456
but it doesn't mean we
have to let it be that way.

31:17.457 --> 31:21.287
So who's with me?

31:21.288 --> 31:23.684
Who wants to come with
me and help bring down

31:23.685 --> 31:27.602
the infamous Nella Kingsberry?

31:34.577 --> 31:35.577
- I'll go.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.253
It should be me.

31:39.373 --> 31:41.684
- Right, let's go then, Sarah.

31:41.685 --> 31:43.102
We won't be long.

31:52.394 --> 31:53.708
- Don't pretend that this isn't giving you

31:53.709 --> 31:55.344
some sort of a thrill.

31:55.345 --> 31:56.178
- What are you talking about?

31:56.179 --> 31:58.040
- You have been waiting for this day

31:58.041 --> 32:00.868
since my brother and
Nella started going out.

32:00.869 --> 32:02.867
- I'm sick of listening to you.

32:02.868 --> 32:06.972
- Why don't you go by Tammy Jane anymore?

32:06.973 --> 32:09.657
- Do not call me that.

32:09.658 --> 32:11.090
- Why, Tammy?

32:11.091 --> 32:12.915
- I swear to God, Carly.

32:12.916 --> 32:15.282
You stole my brother's
relationship with God.

32:15.283 --> 32:17.615
- No, I didn't.

32:17.616 --> 32:20.275
- And then you murdered his unborn child.

32:20.276 --> 32:22.419
- I did not have an abortion, Carly.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.295
- That's why he left you, isn't it?

32:25.296 --> 32:26.296
- Shut up!

32:27.197 --> 32:29.746
- You had to have known that
David would never end up

32:29.747 --> 32:32.367
with trailer trash like you.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.819
Fuck

32:33.820 --> 32:35.019
you.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.020
- TJ, can I talk to you?

32:45.756 --> 32:46.680
- Why am I here?

32:46.681 --> 32:47.942
Why did I agree to be a bridesmaid?

32:47.943 --> 32:49.780
It's because I'm a fucking
masochist, that's why.

32:49.781 --> 32:50.956
Fucking masochist.

32:50.957 --> 32:51.957
- Teej?

32:54.544 --> 32:56.711
David is coming over here.

32:58.955 --> 33:03.122
Carly called him and told
him to come join the party.

33:07.656 --> 33:09.475
- When you gonna talk to her?

33:09.476 --> 33:10.707
- I don't know.

33:10.708 --> 33:15.215
Like when we get there
or find her or whatever.

33:15.216 --> 33:16.955
- I mean TJ.

33:16.956 --> 33:20.314
- TJ, I, I don't.

33:20.315 --> 33:23.232
What are you trying to pull, Sarah?

33:24.278 --> 33:25.270
I'm, it's too late.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.542
I can't do that now.

33:26.543 --> 33:28.018
- No, it's not.

33:28.019 --> 33:29.326
- Yeah, it is.

33:29.327 --> 33:32.098
I mean, she's still
clearly in love with David,

33:32.099 --> 33:33.682
aka my best friend.

33:35.815 --> 33:37.472
Besides, I don't think,

33:37.473 --> 33:40.098
I'm not the kind of guy she needs anyways.

33:40.099 --> 33:42.638
- You already have been, Drew.

33:42.639 --> 33:44.616
Listen, she and David are over.

33:44.617 --> 33:46.214
No matter what happens
with Nella and David,

33:46.215 --> 33:49.886
TJ and David were always going
to be over at some point,

33:49.887 --> 33:50.970
like so over.

33:52.759 --> 33:54.486
Just give her a little bit of time,

33:54.487 --> 33:57.111
but don't give up on her.

33:57.112 --> 33:58.356
- I have given her time.

33:58.357 --> 34:00.521
I've given her time and energy,

34:00.522 --> 34:04.141
and I've given her a shoulder to cry on.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.197
I mean, I feel like all I've done

34:06.198 --> 34:10.368
is talk her through about
seven years of David.

34:10.369 --> 34:12.952
I feel like that's enough time.

34:14.482 --> 34:17.149
- But you haven't asked her out.

34:21.443 --> 34:25.174
- So how did the night end after that?

34:25.175 --> 34:26.360
- Whoo!

34:26.362 --> 34:27.513
- Stay.
- Okay.

34:27.514 --> 34:30.177
- You're making me spill, you guys.

34:30.178 --> 34:31.178
Okay.

34:31.929 --> 34:33.656
Carly's turn.

34:33.657 --> 34:35.650
- No, I'm not playing.
- Go, Carly.

34:35.652 --> 34:36.652
- Pick a card, Carly.

34:36.654 --> 34:37.654
Pick a card.

34:39.020 --> 34:39.856
- Five.

34:39.857 --> 34:41.110
- Five, okay.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.222
Five.

34:42.223 --> 34:46.235
We are going to try to touch
our noses with our fingers,

34:46.235 --> 34:48.018
and whoever doesn't do it loses, okay?

34:48.018 --> 34:48.871
- What?
- On the count of three.

34:48.873 --> 34:50.245
Ready?

34:50.246 --> 34:53.286
One, two, three!

34:53.288 --> 34:54.121
- Nella, you lose.

34:54.121 --> 34:54.954
- Did I miss it?

34:54.955 --> 34:57.165
- Oh, take a drink, Nella!

34:57.166 --> 34:58.691
- Uh, whatever.
- Take a drink, take a drink,

34:58.692 --> 34:59.525
take a drink.

34:59.525 --> 35:00.358
- Cheersies.

35:00.358 --> 35:01.191
- Cheers!

35:01.192 --> 35:04.522
I'll drink with you.
- Mmm.

35:04.523 --> 35:05.930
- Mmm, yum.

35:05.931 --> 35:06.980
- This is pretty strong.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.981
- Okay, TJ's turn.

35:12.173 --> 35:13.263
- What's ace?

35:13.264 --> 35:15.944
- Ooh, never have I ever!

35:15.945 --> 35:17.772
Everybody put three fingers in the air.

35:17.773 --> 35:18.606
- No.

35:18.607 --> 35:20.016
- Yes, this is the fun part!

35:20.017 --> 35:21.688
- No.

35:21.689 --> 35:25.548
- So, we start with TJ, and
we each have to say something

35:25.549 --> 35:28.024
that we have not done, okay?

35:28.025 --> 35:31.851
And if anyone's done
it, they lose a finger.

35:31.852 --> 35:32.929
- Drink that water, Nella.

35:32.930 --> 35:33.763
- Oh.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.428
- Never have I ever...
- This gonna be kind of hard

35:35.429 --> 35:36.727
for us, right, Sarah?

35:36.728 --> 35:38.608
Because of all of
our behavior in high school.

35:38.609 --> 35:39.442
- Okay.

35:39.442 --> 35:40.275
- Do you remember?

35:40.276 --> 35:41.322
- Okay, keep goin', TJ.

35:41.323 --> 35:43.376
- Never have I ever...
- Oh, my gosh!

35:43.377 --> 35:44.565
Do you remember our game
with Coach Anderson?

35:44.566 --> 35:46.698
- Okay, high school memory time is over.

35:46.699 --> 35:48.549
- Never have I ever...

35:48.550 --> 35:51.221
- Carly, can I ask you a question?

35:51.222 --> 35:52.309
Have you lost weight?

35:52.310 --> 35:53.621
You look really good.

35:53.622 --> 35:55.003
- Thank you, Nella.

35:55.004 --> 35:58.777
Yeah, I lost a couple of
sizes over the summer.

35:58.778 --> 36:00.793
You're a size five, right?

36:00.794 --> 36:01.825
- Enough, Nella.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.477
- I wear size five, Sarah.

36:03.478 --> 36:04.311
- You do?

36:04.312 --> 36:07.115
- I do, mm-hmm, when
I wanna wear something

36:07.116 --> 36:11.188
really, really, really,
really, really baggy,

36:11.189 --> 36:12.022
like during my lady time.

36:12.023 --> 36:13.886
- Yeah.

36:13.887 --> 36:16.735
Yeah, mine are a little baggy, too.

36:16.736 --> 36:18.068
- So, yeah, if you lose
a couple more pounds,

36:18.069 --> 36:20.180
then we could share clothes, right?

36:20.181 --> 36:21.014
- Yeah.

36:21.014 --> 36:21.964
- Never have I ever, TJ.

36:21.965 --> 36:23.410
What have you never done?

36:23.411 --> 36:24.244
- There are moments in life

36:24.245 --> 36:27.074
when you see your mortal enemy struggling,

36:27.075 --> 36:30.363
and the sick satisfaction washes over you.

36:30.364 --> 36:32.366
Then there are moments
you find yourself invited

36:32.367 --> 36:34.851
to participate in the infliction.

36:34.852 --> 36:37.623
I'd like to say I chose the
higher road, and when I'm old,

36:37.624 --> 36:39.966
I can look back, pleased with myself,

36:39.967 --> 36:43.014
but sometimes that's just
not the human response.

36:43.015 --> 36:47.378
Never have I ever puked
up my food on purpose.

36:51.968 --> 36:54.542
- Yeah, that was a good one.

36:54.543 --> 36:56.723
- Hey, that's me.

36:56.724 --> 36:58.867
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

36:58.868 --> 36:59.883
You went through that phase.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.718
- Yeah, it was so stupid.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.086
I had this friend that made...
I thought that was Carly.

37:04.087 --> 37:05.533
- Jenny, it's your turn.

37:05.534 --> 37:08.590
- Okay.

37:08.591 --> 37:12.327
Never have I ever...

37:12.328 --> 37:13.620
No, I totally did that.
- You did not!

37:13.621 --> 37:14.666
You did not!

37:16.560 --> 37:18.583
- Okay, okay.

37:18.584 --> 37:22.490
Never have I ever

37:22.491 --> 37:23.361
kissed a girl.

37:23.361 --> 37:24.361
- Ew!

37:26.431 --> 37:28.776
- Really?
- What?

37:28.777 --> 37:29.610
- What?

37:29.611 --> 37:31.108
- I was trying to tell you.

37:31.109 --> 37:34.044
I had this friend fall
semester that I did, you know.

37:36.031 --> 37:37.031
You know.

37:38.331 --> 37:39.255
- I'm getting out of here.

37:39.256 --> 37:40.474
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.308
- It's your turn.

37:41.309 --> 37:42.902
- No, no, no. I am gonna go.

37:42.903 --> 37:45.246
- Nella, you can't leave yet.
- Where my purse, guys?

37:45.247 --> 37:47.798
- Yeah, you have to stay until you play,

37:47.799 --> 37:48.632
and it's your turn.

37:48.632 --> 37:49.465
- I'm leaving.

37:49.465 --> 37:50.298
It's late.

37:50.298 --> 37:51.140
I have to go.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.063
- It's

37:52.063 --> 37:52.944
your

37:52.945 --> 37:54.035
turn.

37:54.036 --> 37:55.036
- Fine, um,

37:56.556 --> 37:58.489
never have I ever been to New York.

37:58.490 --> 37:59.323
There you go!

37:59.323 --> 38:00.156
- Boo!

38:00.156 --> 38:00.989
That doesn't count.

38:00.990 --> 38:02.091
- Oh!
- Again!

38:02.092 --> 38:03.751
- I don't know.

38:03.752 --> 38:04.752
Okay.

38:06.557 --> 38:09.471
Never have I ever done my own homework.

38:09.472 --> 38:13.023
- Try again.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.386
- I'm all out of ideas, okay?

38:14.387 --> 38:15.455
I don't know.

38:15.456 --> 38:17.637
- Hmm, here I'll help you, okay?

38:17.638 --> 38:21.805
Never have I ever cheated on my fiance.

38:23.864 --> 38:26.781
- Really?

38:29.012 --> 38:32.262
Never have I ever cheated on my fiance.

38:33.226 --> 38:34.110
Where's my purse?

38:34.111 --> 38:35.618
- Hey, cut the shit!

38:35.619 --> 38:36.926
We know.

38:36.927 --> 38:38.466
- Could you be
a little more specific?

38:38.467 --> 38:39.654
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:39.655 --> 38:41.527
- You know damn well
what we're talking about.

38:41.528 --> 38:42.517
- Mmm...

38:42.518 --> 38:44.100
Oh, you know what?

38:44.101 --> 38:45.254
Actually, my ride is almost here,

38:45.255 --> 38:46.708
so I need my purse now!

38:46.709 --> 38:47.894
- Wait, what ride?

38:47.895 --> 38:48.886
I thought I was your ride.

38:48.887 --> 38:51.337
Why am I sober right now?

38:51.338 --> 38:53.956
- I didn't want to ruin
your fun, so I got a car.

38:53.957 --> 38:54.881
- I

38:54.881 --> 38:55.714
am

38:55.715 --> 38:56.893
Sober.

38:56.894 --> 38:58.467
I can drive.

38:58.468 --> 39:00.135
- Nella, look at me.

39:01.228 --> 39:02.061
- No!

39:02.062 --> 39:05.277
You're just gonna look at me
with your emotastic eyes, okay?

39:05.278 --> 39:07.182
Let me tell you, that look?

39:07.183 --> 39:08.052
It's over.

39:08.053 --> 39:12.131
It's over, just like your
relationship with my fiance.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.662
- You know what else is over, Nella?

39:13.663 --> 39:14.991
High school.

39:14.992 --> 39:15.970
- Good one.

39:15.970 --> 39:16.803
Awesome.

39:16.803 --> 39:17.709
Ten points.

39:17.710 --> 39:19.942
Did they teach you those
comebacks at Stanford?

39:19.943 --> 39:22.879
- You're dodging the subject, Nella.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.882
Why are you cheating on David?

39:24.883 --> 39:27.455
After everything, why?

39:27.456 --> 39:31.623
- You know, TJ, I am so
sick of your past trauma

39:32.583 --> 39:36.244
being a warrant for you to
police everyone's behavior.

39:36.245 --> 39:37.201
I'm sick of it.

39:37.202 --> 39:38.886
- Nella, stop it.

39:38.887 --> 39:39.974
- That's not the point.

39:39.975 --> 39:41.678
This isn't about me.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.177
- Of course this is about you.

39:44.178 --> 39:47.053
Let me ask you, TJ,

39:47.054 --> 39:49.447
what is it that you think is gonna happen?

39:49.448 --> 39:52.069
Do you think that he's gonna
come crawling back to you,

39:52.070 --> 39:55.302
that he's gonna realize what a witch I am,

39:55.303 --> 39:58.975
that you guys are gonna
live happily ever after

39:58.976 --> 40:00.000
and that you're gonna talk about

40:00.001 --> 40:02.365
how he almost married that whore, Nella?

40:02.366 --> 40:03.817
- Nella, this is cruel.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.357
Stop it!

40:05.358 --> 40:08.766
- There you are, little savior, Sarah.

40:08.767 --> 40:10.658
- Don't look at me and tell me

40:10.659 --> 40:13.159
that high school's over, okay?

40:14.014 --> 40:16.653
So what if I'm cheating on him?

40:16.654 --> 40:20.569
He's my fiance, and it's our relationship.

40:20.570 --> 40:22.881
It's none of your business.

40:22.882 --> 40:25.057
- We'll call David.

40:25.058 --> 40:28.929
If you walk out that door,
we are calling David.

40:28.930 --> 40:30.669
- Well, that sounds like a mistake.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.262
- Why?

40:33.263 --> 40:35.430
- You wanna find out, Jen?

40:36.286 --> 40:39.113
Go ahead.

40:39.114 --> 40:43.349
You clearly have no idea who I am

40:43.350 --> 40:46.144
and what I'm capable of!

40:46.145 --> 40:48.628
Now where's my purse?

40:48.629 --> 40:49.629
- Jenny.

40:53.570 --> 40:55.045
- Thank you.

40:56.430 --> 40:58.045
You stupid bitch.

41:01.348 --> 41:02.578
- Oh, look.

41:02.579 --> 41:03.829
Brandon's here.

41:04.692 --> 41:06.078
Is he your ride?

41:06.079 --> 41:07.706
- Hey, ladies.

41:07.707 --> 41:10.543
Looks like somebody's
been havin' some fun.

41:10.544 --> 41:11.907
Wish I coulda joined ya.

41:11.908 --> 41:13.481
- He smells like weed.

41:13.482 --> 41:16.814
- It looks like it's time
for me to get some shut-eye.

41:16.815 --> 41:19.648
Big day tomorrow, so see you guys!

41:21.905 --> 41:23.572
- What was that for?

41:24.628 --> 41:27.984
- To make you the hero, I guess.

41:27.985 --> 41:28.883
- Night, ladies.

41:28.883 --> 41:29.807
- Night, ladies.

41:29.808 --> 41:31.390
I la-la all of you.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.512
- I la-la you, too!

41:42.405 --> 41:44.738
- Well, what're we gonna do?

41:56.077 --> 41:59.055
- I know you're all gonna make fun of me,

41:59.056 --> 41:59.889
but in times like these,

41:59.890 --> 42:03.389
we can always turn to the power of prayer.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.952
- And then we called you.

42:11.953 --> 42:13.203
- So that's it.

42:15.892 --> 42:18.443
- Well, I did have a conversation

42:18.444 --> 42:20.776
with a drunken TJ about you.

42:20.777 --> 42:21.610
- What?

42:21.611 --> 42:23.076
Really?

42:23.077 --> 42:24.877
- That was interesting.

42:24.878 --> 42:26.813
- Wait, what did she say?

42:26.814 --> 42:28.552
- None of you damn business.

42:28.553 --> 42:29.553
- Seriously?

42:30.634 --> 42:32.721
- Well, it's not.

42:32.722 --> 42:34.202
- Well, you just made it my business.

42:36.375 --> 42:39.299
- What are we gonna tell him?

42:39.300 --> 42:40.300
- We...

42:41.150 --> 42:42.150
We...

42:42.832 --> 42:44.437
Oh, we can't let him come here.

42:44.438 --> 42:46.648
We have to stop him.

42:46.649 --> 42:47.649
Damn it!

42:48.786 --> 42:50.037
- This is all my fault.

42:50.038 --> 42:51.609
I shouldn't have let her go,

42:51.610 --> 42:53.229
and now David is gonna
get really hurt by this...

42:53.230 --> 42:57.342
- Stop saying this is your fault, Jenny!

42:57.343 --> 42:59.510
Nella planned it this way.

43:02.031 --> 43:03.031
I'm sorry.

43:03.826 --> 43:05.993
I know how you feel, okay?

43:11.608 --> 43:14.216
- Maybe Carly's right.

43:14.217 --> 43:18.045
Maybe we are all like
Nella in some sick way.

43:18.046 --> 43:19.232
I mean, seriously, though,

43:19.233 --> 43:23.129
I did like seeing her make
Carly uncomfortable tonight,

43:23.130 --> 43:24.745
the same way that I pushed Nella

43:24.746 --> 43:27.805
to confess that she cheated.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.037
- That doesn't make us like her.

43:29.038 --> 43:31.477
That makes us human.

43:31.478 --> 43:32.978
- Well, I hate it.

43:41.235 --> 43:42.735
Teej,

43:44.732 --> 43:46.399
for what it's worth,

43:47.458 --> 43:51.125
I think you would've
made a really good Mom.

43:54.938 --> 43:56.271
- Thanks, Jenny.

44:04.656 --> 44:06.156
We gotta tell him.

44:08.220 --> 44:09.220
- Yeah.

44:13.862 --> 44:15.027
- What're you doin'?

44:15.028 --> 44:17.028
- None of your business.

44:19.582 --> 44:20.902
- I'm gonna go make a phone call.

44:23.568 --> 44:24.568
- Oh, shit.

44:30.657 --> 44:31.657
- Surprise!

44:33.724 --> 44:36.141
Party's here.

44:40.215 --> 44:43.799
Oh, I'm, am I interrupting girl time?

44:43.800 --> 44:45.084
They told me I was okay to come over.

44:45.085 --> 44:46.085
I'm sorry.

44:49.643 --> 44:50.939
Guys, what is goin' on here?

44:50.940 --> 44:52.523
Is everything okay?

44:57.716 --> 44:58.883
Where's Nella?

44:59.939 --> 45:01.786
- Ah, shit!

45:01.787 --> 45:04.037
- Drew, be careful!

45:06.329 --> 45:11.158
- We're in.

45:14.911 --> 45:18.838
- Well, she's not sleeping.

45:18.839 --> 45:21.114
- Hey, sorry I missed your call.

45:21.115 --> 45:22.115
Not really.

45:22.116 --> 45:22.949
Leave a message, and maybe I'll...

45:22.950 --> 45:24.461
- Still not answering.

45:24.462 --> 45:26.650
- Have you tried texting her?

45:26.651 --> 45:27.651
- You try.

45:29.531 --> 45:32.031
- Pick up your damn-ass phone!

45:33.615 --> 45:36.274
- I like the sort of shrine
she built for herself.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.134
- Yeah, there's not
even a picture of David.

45:39.135 --> 45:40.718
- It's sad, really.

45:41.775 --> 45:43.513
- I'm getting my beauty sleep.

45:43.514 --> 45:45.186
That's funny, because I'm
standing in your room.

45:45.187 --> 45:47.104
Get your ass over here!

45:51.063 --> 45:53.009
Why is she like this?

45:53.010 --> 45:54.052
- She's always been like this.

45:54.053 --> 45:58.874
- What's the matter with me?

45:58.875 --> 46:01.292
- Do you wanna talk about it?

46:34.540 --> 46:35.373
Ugh!

46:35.374 --> 46:37.231
Brandon Scott?

46:37.232 --> 46:38.065
- David.

46:38.065 --> 46:38.994
- Are you kidding me?

46:38.995 --> 46:40.580
Isn't he a drug dealer or something?

46:40.581 --> 46:41.924
- I think this is just like in the Bible

46:41.925 --> 46:43.346
when they talk about
being unequally yoked.

46:43.347 --> 46:44.180
Maybe this...

46:44.181 --> 46:45.611
- Stop talking!

46:45.612 --> 46:47.596
- Well, I mean someone
has to speak the truth.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.627
I hate to be the one to say it.

46:49.628 --> 46:50.747
- Well, then don't say it.

46:50.748 --> 46:52.410
- Well, David, I'm worried about you.

46:52.411 --> 46:53.826
Are you gonna be okay?

46:53.827 --> 46:55.003
- No.
- You can talk to me.

46:55.004 --> 46:56.471
- No, Carly, no, I'm not going to be okay.

46:56.472 --> 46:59.273
I just found out that my
wife-to-be is cheating on me.

46:59.274 --> 47:00.833
- Okay, well, would you
feel better talking about it

47:00.834 --> 47:02.334
if TJ wasn't here?

47:10.450 --> 47:12.533
- What is wrong with you?

47:13.762 --> 47:14.642
- Tammy Jane.

47:14.642 --> 47:15.481
- Stay away from me.

47:15.481 --> 47:16.314
- Tammy Jane.

47:16.314 --> 47:17.248
- Stay away from me!

47:17.249 --> 47:19.970
- Hey, hey, hey, Tammy, please?

47:19.971 --> 47:20.804
- Freak!

47:20.805 --> 47:21.858
- Hey, hey, hey, can
you please not hit me?

47:21.859 --> 47:23.427
Can we just talk?

47:23.428 --> 47:24.639
- Why'd you leave me?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.090
- Oh, come on, Tammy.

47:26.091 --> 47:26.924
You know why.

47:26.925 --> 47:29.818
- Oh, 'cause you're so stupid!

47:29.819 --> 47:31.119
- Please, I'm sorry.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.708
You know I didn't mean it like that.

47:32.709 --> 47:34.468
- You were afraid, admit it,

47:34.469 --> 47:36.260
so you chose the easy way out.

47:36.261 --> 47:38.009
- Yes, yes, of course I was scared.

47:38.010 --> 47:40.127
I was being plunged into
a life I hadn't decided

47:40.128 --> 47:41.218
I even wanted yet.

47:41.219 --> 47:43.089
- I didn't get to decide.

47:43.090 --> 47:45.518
It was chosen for me,
and you just got to run.

47:45.519 --> 47:47.328
- Yes, it was exactly like that.

47:47.329 --> 47:50.162
You know,

47:52.730 --> 47:55.460
everything I tried to
give you, everything,

47:55.461 --> 47:57.544
you shot back in my face.

47:59.111 --> 48:01.009
You don't think I was
hurt by you, too, Tammy?

48:01.010 --> 48:02.010
I loved you.

48:03.989 --> 48:08.156
- I didn't mean to.

48:09.127 --> 48:10.127
- I know.

48:11.759 --> 48:12.926
I know, Tammy.

48:14.021 --> 48:17.580
We never meant to, but that's what we did.

48:17.581 --> 48:21.918
We didn't fall apart
because of what happened.

48:21.919 --> 48:23.398
We fell apart, because we couldn't be

48:23.399 --> 48:24.527
what each other needed.

48:24.528 --> 48:27.140
- And Nella?

48:27.141 --> 48:28.300
Is that what you need?

48:28.301 --> 48:31.468
How's that workin' out for you, David?

48:32.959 --> 48:36.278
- People make mistakes.

48:36.279 --> 48:38.871
- Hmm, still takin'
the easy way out, I see.

48:38.872 --> 48:42.261
- You know?

48:42.262 --> 48:43.290
That's not fair.

48:43.291 --> 48:46.107
- What's not fair is being
abandoned and pregnant.

48:46.108 --> 48:48.878
- It wasn't like that.

48:48.879 --> 48:50.710
- Spoken like a true cheater.

48:50.711 --> 48:53.088
- I never cheated on you, Tammy.

48:53.089 --> 48:55.717
- Well, you might as well have.

48:55.718 --> 48:56.551
Ha!

48:56.552 --> 48:57.876
What makes her so special?

48:57.877 --> 48:59.957
Please tell me.

48:59.958 --> 49:04.125
How long was it before she
had a ring on her finger?

49:05.635 --> 49:06.635
Six

49:07.396 --> 49:08.387
months.

49:08.387 --> 49:09.387
Six months.

49:11.628 --> 49:14.296
What could she give you in six months

49:14.297 --> 49:17.630
that I couldn't give you in seven years?

49:23.969 --> 49:25.336
- Look, I don't have an answer

49:25.337 --> 49:28.670
that's gonna make you happy, Tammy Jane.

49:31.708 --> 49:34.128
I didn't make the right choices with you,

49:34.129 --> 49:35.379
and I am sorry.

49:37.788 --> 49:39.808
And I don't know what it was with Nella

49:39.809 --> 49:41.037
that made anything different.

49:41.038 --> 49:41.871
I don't know.

49:41.872 --> 49:44.121
It just did.

49:47.948 --> 49:51.615
I don't wish anything
but happiness for you,

49:53.588 --> 49:55.921
but I can't be that for you,

49:56.908 --> 49:59.075
and I think you know that.

50:02.798 --> 50:07.636
- I don't wish anything but
happiness for you either, David,

50:07.637 --> 50:10.656
but not by taking the easy way out.

50:10.657 --> 50:13.324
That happiness, it doesn't last.

50:16.598 --> 50:18.431
- You don't know that.

50:23.278 --> 50:24.445
- So what now?

50:27.118 --> 50:29.868
Are you gonna marry her tomorrow?

50:42.929 --> 50:43.929
- It's Drew.

50:44.908 --> 50:46.408
- Don't answer it.

50:47.798 --> 50:48.798
Don't.

50:58.238 --> 50:59.321
- Yo.

51:00.748 --> 51:03.465
Yeah, yeah, I'm at the hotel.

51:03.466 --> 51:04.466
No.

51:05.407 --> 51:06.824
No, they told me.

51:08.076 --> 51:10.409
Yeah, fine, I'm, I'm comin'.

51:27.225 --> 51:30.597
- Stop it.

51:30.598 --> 51:32.037
I'm getting married tomorrow.

51:32.872 --> 51:35.454
Okay?

51:37.340 --> 51:40.923
Okay, I'm going, but
you're coming with me.

51:41.981 --> 51:43.121
- Oh, fuck.

51:43.122 --> 51:44.704
Those fuckers, they're here.

51:44.705 --> 51:45.538
- Be nice.

51:45.539 --> 51:47.494
- Sarah
wasn't always a good person.

51:47.495 --> 51:50.231
It took her a long time to get there.

51:50.232 --> 51:52.712
Something did change for
her that night, though.

51:52.713 --> 51:56.094
The last bit of fear Nella had
been hanging over her head,

51:56.095 --> 51:59.702
Sarah wrapped it up and got
rid of it for the last time.

51:59.703 --> 52:01.581
I think we all knew this was the end

52:01.582 --> 52:04.952
of our friendship with Nella for good.

52:04.953 --> 52:07.572
- Oh, hello my fair lesbian friend.

52:07.573 --> 52:08.826
- Shut the fuck up.

52:08.827 --> 52:09.768
Hey!

52:09.768 --> 52:10.644
You!

52:10.645 --> 52:12.227
Oatmeal cookie boy.

52:13.568 --> 52:14.729
- Okay, kitten.

52:14.730 --> 52:16.038
- No!

52:16.039 --> 52:19.078
I hope you're really happy one day.

52:19.079 --> 52:19.912
- All right.

52:19.913 --> 52:22.729
- Okay, I hope that someday
you are a very happy person

52:22.730 --> 52:25.169
so you can fully understand
all the unhappiness

52:25.170 --> 52:26.678
you caused a lot of people.

52:26.679 --> 52:28.577
- Look, I'm not the one
that seduced her, all right?

52:28.578 --> 52:29.559
- What does that matter?

52:29.560 --> 52:30.758
She's getting married.

52:30.759 --> 52:31.610
- Yeah, well, maybe her husband

52:31.611 --> 52:34.277
should keep a closer eye on her.

52:37.447 --> 52:39.279
- That was rude.

52:39.280 --> 52:40.296
- David's coming.

52:40.297 --> 52:41.367
- What?

52:41.368 --> 52:43.285
Wait, you called David?

52:44.419 --> 52:45.738
You called David over a little bit

52:45.739 --> 52:47.007
of the wedding-day jitters?

52:47.008 --> 52:49.047
- You call this jitters?

52:49.048 --> 52:51.548
Fucking the bartender the
night before your wedding?

52:51.549 --> 52:53.125
This is far beyond jitters, Nella,

52:53.126 --> 52:54.766
and I'm not sure I'll
ever understand exactly

52:54.767 --> 52:55.600
what it is with you.

52:55.601 --> 52:57.778
- That's because you don't
know how to let your hair down

52:57.779 --> 52:58.818
and have some fun.

52:58.819 --> 53:00.258
- Stop it with these games.

53:00.259 --> 53:01.259
This isn't fun.

53:01.260 --> 53:02.799
- The old Sarah would have asked me,

53:02.800 --> 53:04.076
does he have a brother?

53:04.077 --> 53:05.077
Oh, please.

53:05.829 --> 53:07.506
It was good to just not jump on board.

53:07.507 --> 53:08.818
You were always the last one to cave,

53:08.819 --> 53:10.698
the last one to join in on the games,

53:10.699 --> 53:14.247
and the last one to lose
your virginity.

53:14.248 --> 53:15.081
- Gross.

53:15.082 --> 53:16.658
- You know what?

53:16.659 --> 53:18.658
You're always the first person to thank me

53:18.659 --> 53:20.348
for pushing you over the edge,

53:20.349 --> 53:22.726
for making you feel alive,
okay, so lighten up,

53:22.727 --> 53:24.795
because I don't like
the stick up your ass.

53:24.796 --> 53:27.756
- I'm not proud of my past, Nella.

53:27.757 --> 53:29.447
I'm not proud of that shit.

53:29.448 --> 53:31.287
It haunts me.

53:31.288 --> 53:33.338
We were bad people.

53:33.339 --> 53:34.926
- Oh, wait.

53:34.927 --> 53:36.959
What you're telling me
is that you were having

53:36.960 --> 53:39.657
the best time being sober tonight?

53:39.658 --> 53:40.491
No.

53:40.492 --> 53:42.106
See, what I think,

53:42.107 --> 53:44.748
I think that you were just
afraid that the old Sarah

53:44.749 --> 53:46.258
was gonna come out and
that she's gonna make

53:46.259 --> 53:48.079
really bad decisions.

53:48.080 --> 53:48.913
But you know what?

53:48.914 --> 53:50.239
I miss that old Sarah.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.738
- Stop it.

53:51.739 --> 53:52.927
- No, I'm not gonna stop it.

53:52.928 --> 53:55.268
It wasn't fun making fun
of Carly all by myself.

53:55.269 --> 53:58.188
Let's not forget who started
that joke in the first place.

53:58.189 --> 53:59.166
- Leave her alone.

53:59.167 --> 54:01.159
She has real problems, and it's my fault.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.399
- Oh, really?

54:02.400 --> 54:06.887
So, so it's not my fault that
she has scars on her wrists?

54:06.888 --> 54:09.058
Listen, I don't think
that I'm the bad guy here.

54:09.059 --> 54:10.167
I don't think so.

54:10.168 --> 54:11.001
- Grow up.

54:11.002 --> 54:12.388
I am done.

54:12.389 --> 54:13.716
- Oh, you're done?

54:13.717 --> 54:14.550
What do you mean you're done?

54:14.551 --> 54:17.228
No, you left, okay?

54:17.229 --> 54:20.372
And apparently you cut me
out of your college life,

54:20.373 --> 54:23.520
so no, you don't get to come back here

54:23.521 --> 54:26.622
and act like everyone forgot who you were.

54:26.623 --> 54:28.161
No one believes your little act, Sarah,

54:28.162 --> 54:30.001
so just give it up.

54:30.002 --> 54:32.002
- People grow up, Nella,

54:33.790 --> 54:36.382
and fine, if this is the
way you want it to be,

54:36.383 --> 54:37.412
then I'll be there tomorrow,

54:37.413 --> 54:39.732
but it won't be for you.

54:39.733 --> 54:40.566
- Okay.

54:40.566 --> 54:41.471
- After the wedding, I'm gone,

54:41.472 --> 54:44.470
and I never wanna see you again.

54:44.471 --> 54:46.346
- Sarah, come on, you don't,

54:46.347 --> 54:47.452
you don't mean that.

54:47.453 --> 54:49.662
- Good-bye, Nella.

54:49.663 --> 54:50.663
- What?

54:53.291 --> 54:54.652
- So yeah, I'll just
leave the door unlocked.

54:54.653 --> 54:56.521
Do you have your keys.

54:56.522 --> 54:57.355
Oh, there they are.

54:57.355 --> 54:58.355
Cool.

54:59.801 --> 55:00.634
Drink some water.

55:00.634 --> 55:01.634
- Bye.

55:05.349 --> 55:06.349
Whatever.

55:14.219 --> 55:15.969
- What are you doing?

55:17.081 --> 55:20.349
- Writing down a list of
Bible verses to give to David.

55:20.350 --> 55:23.800
- How about it is better

55:23.801 --> 55:25.418
to dwell in the wilderness

55:25.419 --> 55:28.000
than with a contentious and angry woman.

55:28.001 --> 55:29.448
- How about do not be deceived.

55:29.449 --> 55:32.858
Bad company corrupts good morals.

55:32.859 --> 55:35.609
- Yeah, that one fits Nella, too.

55:36.809 --> 55:40.320
- Nella may not be the Proverbs 31 wife,

55:40.321 --> 55:41.786
but at least my brother has hope for her,

55:41.787 --> 55:44.058
and she goes to church with him.

55:44.059 --> 55:47.059
- Oh, just like you had hope for TJ?

55:48.519 --> 55:51.040
- Do not associate with
a so-called brother

55:51.041 --> 55:54.285
if he is an immoral person or covetous

55:54.286 --> 55:57.925
or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard,

55:57.926 --> 56:00.896
not even to eat with such a one.

56:00.897 --> 56:03.434
- Do not point out the
speck in your brother's eye

56:03.435 --> 56:06.272
before removing the log in your own.

56:06.273 --> 56:08.422
- Be aware of false
prophets who come to you

56:08.423 --> 56:10.264
dressed in sheep's clothing but inwardly

56:10.265 --> 56:12.704
are ravenous wolves.

56:12.705 --> 56:16.234
- If any man thinks he is
religious and does not bridle

56:16.235 --> 56:18.136
his tongue but deceives in his heart,

56:18.137 --> 56:21.285
this person's religion is worthless.

56:21.286 --> 56:23.605
- Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor,

56:23.606 --> 56:26.182
him I will destroy.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.440
Whoever has a haughty look
and an arrogant heart,

56:28.441 --> 56:30.024
I shall not endure.

56:31.061 --> 56:32.691
Four years of high school youth group,

56:32.692 --> 56:35.775
two years of Awana, one year of YWAM.

56:37.442 --> 56:38.822
- Ha!

56:38.823 --> 56:41.951
Four years of Awana, four years
of high school youth group,

56:41.952 --> 56:43.350
two years of youth group counseling,

56:43.351 --> 56:46.101
plus one year in the Peace Corps.

56:47.463 --> 56:51.546
- You were a youth group
counselor for two years?

56:52.554 --> 56:54.471
- Well, one and a half.

56:55.474 --> 56:56.521
You know what, Carly?

56:56.522 --> 56:58.593
If you weren't so busy
making sure everyone else

56:58.594 --> 57:01.273
is following your book of religious rules,

57:01.274 --> 57:02.969
you might actually like a person or two.

57:02.970 --> 57:04.041
- I do not do that.

57:04.042 --> 57:05.433
- You do.

57:05.434 --> 57:06.793
Why don't we take a look at
that little book of yours...

57:06.794 --> 57:07.893
- No! No, no.

57:07.894 --> 57:08.727
Give that back to me!
- Give it here.

57:08.728 --> 57:10.227
- No, I wanna see.

57:11.740 --> 57:14.728
These aren't Bible verses.

57:14.729 --> 57:16.396
Carly, what is this?

57:17.258 --> 57:19.606
- I keep track of things.

57:19.607 --> 57:21.419
I just, I need to keep track

57:21.420 --> 57:22.785
so that I stay on track.

57:22.786 --> 57:25.619
- Carly, this is crazy.

57:32.984 --> 57:36.375
When I was 13, I was
in love with this boy,

57:36.376 --> 57:38.285
Jimmy Stratton.

57:38.286 --> 57:39.986
He was in my math class.

57:39.987 --> 57:42.255
And he would always chew gum,

57:42.256 --> 57:44.434
so I made sure to always have gum on me

57:44.435 --> 57:46.386
just in case he would ask.

57:46.387 --> 57:48.463
One day he finally asked,

57:48.464 --> 57:49.881
and I was elated.

57:51.325 --> 57:54.386
It finally gave me
permission to talk to him.

57:54.387 --> 57:58.351
And it turns out he liked me too.

57:58.352 --> 57:59.781
So, to make a long story short...

57:59.782 --> 58:01.115
- It's too late.

58:03.659 --> 58:08.021
- To make a long story short,

58:08.022 --> 58:09.662
we dated.

58:09.663 --> 58:14.169
He even held my hand
during math class.

58:14.170 --> 58:17.003
Then a week later,

58:18.386 --> 58:21.635
he found someone else to give him gum,

58:21.636 --> 58:24.105
and I was devastated.

58:24.106 --> 58:27.856
I cried every day for, like, weeks.

58:28.964 --> 58:33.313
I thought maybe it was
because I wasn't pretty

58:33.314 --> 58:37.064
or I wasn't blonde or
because I wasn't smart.

58:39.172 --> 58:42.731
And finally, my mom sat
me down, and she said,

58:42.732 --> 58:47.321
"Jenny, you have two choices
to make in every situation.

58:47.322 --> 58:51.539
"You can laugh, or you can cry.

58:51.540 --> 58:53.920
"And neither one is the wrong choice,

58:53.921 --> 58:57.421
"but the choice you make will define you."

59:00.255 --> 59:03.255
- What if you don't know what to do?

59:04.953 --> 59:08.380
- I think you do know what to do.

59:08.381 --> 59:12.123
You just need to be brave
enough to let yourself be honest

59:12.124 --> 59:15.707
with your feelings, you know?

59:16.721 --> 59:17.721
- Yeah.

59:43.679 --> 59:47.846
♫ I fantasized this love with you

59:51.621 --> 59:55.538
♫ And not a drop of it is true

59:59.589 --> 01:00:03.946
♫ It pours inside my weary heart

01:00:06.498 --> 01:00:07.998
- Whoo! Your turn!

01:00:11.037 --> 01:00:12.497
How's that tasting?
- It's good.

01:00:22.631 --> 01:00:26.798
♫ We're living a life of quiet desperation

01:00:30.868 --> 01:00:35.035
♫ Holding on to reach into the sun

01:00:38.607 --> 01:00:42.774
♫ Is there something in this
mess that is worth saving

01:00:44.055 --> 01:00:45.055
- Two, three, blow it up!

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:50.525
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:52.370
- Two!

01:00:59.028 --> 01:01:00.861
♫ Ooh

01:01:06.905 --> 01:01:08.738
♫ Ooh

01:01:24.215 --> 01:01:25.566
- Hey there, sexy lady.

01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:26.606
How much for your body?

01:01:26.607 --> 01:01:28.651
- More than you can afford.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:30.956
- I only need five minutes.

01:01:30.957 --> 01:01:32.036
- Where's Drew?

01:01:32.037 --> 01:01:35.454
- With David, doing his groomsmanly duty.

01:01:36.586 --> 01:01:37.682
Get in.

01:01:37.683 --> 01:01:41.850
I feel like you have some
drama I need to hear about.

01:01:44.514 --> 01:01:45.347
While you're talking,

01:01:45.348 --> 01:01:48.413
I'm going to buy us the
greasiest breakfast I can find.

01:01:48.414 --> 01:01:51.247
- Hmm, nothing has sounded better.

01:01:52.445 --> 01:01:55.260
- So I take it David graced
you with his presence?

01:01:55.261 --> 01:01:56.261
- Yeah.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:00.594
You know,

01:02:00.595 --> 01:02:03.124
I don't even think I love him anymore.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:07.302
I just don't want him
to love someone else.

01:02:07.303 --> 01:02:09.182
Is that selfish?

01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:12.594
- Considering the circumstances, no.

01:02:17.486 --> 01:02:20.486
David is no saint in this, you know?

01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:28.152
- So is there gonna be a wedding?

01:02:28.153 --> 01:02:29.153
- No idea.

01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:31.634
But if there is, I plan on developing

01:02:31.635 --> 01:02:34.385
a healthy food baby for pictures.

01:02:41.256 --> 01:02:43.756
- Proposed to her right there.

01:02:47.685 --> 01:02:49.694
I was gonna go over to her place.

01:02:49.695 --> 01:02:53.862
I was gonna tell her what
a terrible person she is,

01:02:55.006 --> 01:02:59.173
and I was gonna break
up with her.

01:03:02.536 --> 01:03:04.619
- So what's stopping you?

01:03:05.835 --> 01:03:09.668
- Is it terrible that I
still wanna marry her?

01:03:10.674 --> 01:03:13.895
- Well, I don't know if
terrible's the right word.

01:03:13.896 --> 01:03:17.463
Weird, confusing, gross, those...

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:18.464
Yeah, terrible.

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:20.164
Terrible's good.

01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:21.725
- Knock it off, man, all right?

01:03:21.726 --> 01:03:23.703
You don't know how this feels.

01:03:23.704 --> 01:03:25.943
- I don't know how this feels?

01:03:25.944 --> 01:03:28.063
Well, enlighten me, David.

01:03:28.064 --> 01:03:29.285
How does it feel?

01:03:29.286 --> 01:03:31.354
How does it feel to be you?

01:03:31.355 --> 01:03:32.735
Because I would have given my left arm

01:03:32.736 --> 01:03:34.223
to have some of the
opportunities that you had

01:03:34.224 --> 01:03:35.463
in high school, okay?

01:03:35.464 --> 01:03:36.855
And I'm not just gonna sit by

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:39.423
and watch you do this to yourself again.

01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:42.463
I mean, how could you
wanna be with somebody

01:03:42.464 --> 01:03:44.547
who treats you like this?

01:03:46.835 --> 01:03:48.502
I'm sorry, I just...

01:03:51.112 --> 01:03:53.970
I've stood by you

01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:58.138
when you made some pretty
dumb decisions in the past.

01:03:59.891 --> 01:04:02.641
Please don't make me do it again.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.819
- I funked up everything with Tammy, okay?

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.629
It's like I've been trying so
hard not to mess this one up

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.869
that I can't help but feel
now like this is my fault.

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:19.120
I picked up extra shifts so
that she wouldn't have to work.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:21.209
I just wanted to be the
one to take care of her

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:22.043
and make her happy.

01:04:22.044 --> 01:04:25.621
I mean, I even let her
win all of our arguments.

01:04:25.622 --> 01:04:27.152
- You...

01:04:27.153 --> 01:04:30.570
Sorry, you let her win all the arguments?

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:41.111
- Sounds so stupid now.

01:04:41.112 --> 01:04:44.195
- Well, what did she ever do for you?

01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.591
- What do you mean?

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:49.410
- I mean, correct me if I'm
wrong, but relationships

01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:52.410
are supposed to be a
two-way street, aren't they?

01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:53.450
I mean, you sure gave her a lot.

01:04:53.451 --> 01:04:54.719
What did she ever give you?

01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:04.268
David, I'll stand up there tomorrow, okay?

01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:06.620
I'll turn every single
person away at the gate,

01:05:06.621 --> 01:05:09.290
and I'll make sure that they
know what a good guy David is

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.079
as they leave.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.148
You just give me the go-ahead,

01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:14.899
and that's where I'll be for you.

01:05:18.021 --> 01:05:21.354
I hear Mexico is nice this time of year.

01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:26.691
- No.

01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:28.911
I don't want that.

01:05:31.518 --> 01:05:33.408
Leavin' Nella at the altar's

01:05:33.409 --> 01:05:36.742
not gonna make me a good guy, all right?

01:05:37.657 --> 01:05:41.824
I gave her my word, and I'm
gonna follow through this time.

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:48.942
- Well, then,

01:05:50.979 --> 01:05:53.588
I will be up there with you at the altar.

01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:55.359
I just might need a flask in my pocket

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.877
to get me through the day.

01:05:57.878 --> 01:05:59.045
- Fair enough.

01:06:00.979 --> 01:06:03.308
You got one for me, too, right?

01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:05.547
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:05.548 --> 01:06:09.715
- Let's hit it.

01:06:12.171 --> 01:06:13.757
- You look awesome.

01:06:14.592 --> 01:06:16.816
I mean it, really cool.

01:06:16.817 --> 01:06:18.345
- Never...

01:06:18.346 --> 01:06:19.596
- Mm-hmm, keep going.

01:06:19.597 --> 01:06:21.927
- Never have I ever...

01:06:21.928 --> 01:06:22.848
- Mm-hmm, get to it.

01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:25.407
- Never have I ever been drunk.

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:26.908
- Ah, not anymore.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:28.866
- Drink.

01:06:28.866 --> 01:06:29.866
I drink.

01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:35.425
- I'm sorry, should we leave?

01:06:35.426 --> 01:06:37.007
- Oh, hi.

01:06:37.008 --> 01:06:39.815
We're playing The King's Cup,

01:06:39.816 --> 01:06:43.152
and we're doing make-up, halfsies style.

01:06:44.635 --> 01:06:48.684
So this half, right here,
this is a drag queen,

01:06:48.685 --> 01:06:51.292
and then this half right here is...

01:06:51.293 --> 01:06:52.293
It's 80s.

01:06:53.736 --> 01:06:56.819
- And this half is Dothraki princess.

01:06:57.934 --> 01:07:00.586
This half David Bowie.

01:07:00.587 --> 01:07:01.837
- Yeah.
- I see.

01:07:03.445 --> 01:07:05.044
- Lightening.

01:07:05.045 --> 01:07:07.035
- My lip liner is also my eyeliner.

01:07:09.047 --> 01:07:10.412
Teej!

01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:12.078
I was so worried about you.

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.153
You just left.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.422
- How are you guys still alive?

01:07:15.423 --> 01:07:16.990
- Oh, God.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.349
Carly?

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.492
They got us Becca's.

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:21.993
- That sounds so nice.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.955
- It's okay, I got extra.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.433
- TJ, do you...

01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:33.851
Do you wanna share my hash brown with me?

01:07:35.103 --> 01:07:38.620
You can sit right here, right there,

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.220
right on this couch,

01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:43.054
just right there right next to me.

01:07:44.431 --> 01:07:45.481
- We got a nugget.

01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.315
- It's kind of a moon.

01:07:48.261 --> 01:07:49.230
This is so good.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.230
Thanks, guys.

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.420
- It's Drew.

01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:55.990
- Hi, Drew.

01:07:55.991 --> 01:07:56.991
- Hey.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.842
- What's happening?

01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:05.388
- We're at the wedding.

01:08:05.389 --> 01:08:06.797
- Who's wedding?

01:08:06.798 --> 01:08:09.298
- I'll give you three guesses.

01:08:12.198 --> 01:08:13.198
Okay, fine.

01:08:14.306 --> 01:08:16.866
I hope you girls didn't skip town already.

01:08:16.867 --> 01:08:18.407
- Seriously?

01:08:18.408 --> 01:08:21.310
I really hope you're joking.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.791
- No, actually.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:24.962
I don't joke about natural disasters.

01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:26.350
It's kind of a line I draw.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:29.773
- So you're saying I have
to wear a dress today?

01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:31.667
- Uh, yeah.
- Why is everybody mad?

01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:34.707
Can't we all just get along?

01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:38.875
- And, yeah, Nella'll be there
soon to pick you guys up.

01:08:39.725 --> 01:08:40.559
- What?

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.207
Why?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:43.291
- So...

01:08:44.629 --> 01:08:48.484
- Well don't expect me to look pretty.

01:08:48.486 --> 01:08:50.903
- You always look pretty, TJ.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.460
- Text me the address.

01:08:59.357 --> 01:09:02.107
- Just save me a dance for later.

01:09:03.009 --> 01:09:04.009
- Yeah.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.130
- Yeah?

01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:07.861
- Yeah.

01:09:08.528 --> 01:09:10.660
- Okay.

01:09:10.661 --> 01:09:11.969
Yeah, I will,

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:13.939
will send you that text.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:14.941
- Okay.

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.850
- Yes!

01:09:24.759 --> 01:09:25.759
Whoo!

01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:29.701
Oh, God.

01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:32.759
- What in heck got into you?

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.760
- Oh, hey.

01:09:35.599 --> 01:09:37.309
It's the dentist.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:38.727
I'll be right in.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.587
- What did he say?

01:09:45.589 --> 01:09:46.839
- He likes her.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.578
- He's got like a fast crush on you.

01:09:49.578 --> 01:09:51.258
- All right.

01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:54.198
Let's just get this day over with.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.450
Nella's coming.

01:09:59.135 --> 01:10:03.302
- Okay, Carly, if your dream
guy is a motor vehicle,

01:10:04.605 --> 01:10:09.015
what kind of car would he be,
and where are you driving?

01:10:09.016 --> 01:10:12.553
- Hot, hot red Mustang.

01:10:12.554 --> 01:10:16.865
He is sweeping us across the coastline

01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:18.804
to find the prettiest beach,

01:10:18.805 --> 01:10:21.015
prettiest beach that you ever did see.

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:25.183
And when we get there, we are gonna do it.

01:10:28.668 --> 01:10:30.209
- I think I like her better drunk.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:32.710
- You guys, Carly is so horny!

01:10:33.842 --> 01:10:35.759
Okay, Jenny, your turn.

01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:41.137
- A yellow bug.

01:10:41.138 --> 01:10:43.398
One that turns on my
favorite music station

01:10:43.399 --> 01:10:44.803
right when I'm about to get in

01:10:44.804 --> 01:10:48.553
with my clicker key,

01:10:48.554 --> 01:10:52.645
and I don't know where we're going,

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:55.034
but it's somewhere exotic,

01:10:55.035 --> 01:10:57.785
and it's the middle of the night.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.705
- You're high maintenance.

01:10:59.706 --> 01:11:02.595
- I know what I want.

01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:04.155
- What about you?

01:11:04.156 --> 01:11:07.526
What kind of your car
would your boy or girl be?

01:11:07.527 --> 01:11:09.884
- Oh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

01:11:09.885 --> 01:11:12.413
My car can fly, bitches,
and we're goin' to the moon.

01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:17.527
You're not getting out of this Teej.

01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:21.452
- At this point, a nice,
sturdy, reliable Jeep

01:11:21.453 --> 01:11:23.286
would do me just fine.

01:11:24.487 --> 01:11:28.894
Four-wheel drive, obviously,
and we would be driving

01:11:28.895 --> 01:11:33.062
deep into the forest to a
cabin only we know about.

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:35.479
- Also horny!

01:11:36.596 --> 01:11:37.596
- Always!

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:41.379
- Nose, girls.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.213
- Hey, guys!

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.213
Hey!

01:12:01.658 --> 01:12:04.658
Okay, don't all get excited at once.

01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:06.837
Okay, so no one's gonna talk today.

01:12:06.838 --> 01:12:08.378
I'm getting married, hello?

01:12:08.379 --> 01:12:09.310
Yay!

01:12:09.311 --> 01:12:11.819
- What would you want us to say?

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.997
- What do you mean?

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:17.608
- If we were to say
something, what would we say?

01:12:17.609 --> 01:12:18.942
Congratulations?

01:12:19.978 --> 01:12:22.088
We're so happy for you two.

01:12:22.089 --> 01:12:23.839
You were meant to be.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.389
- Yeah, any one of those is fine.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.317
- I cannot believe you're
going through with this.

01:12:31.318 --> 01:12:32.151
- You know what, TJ?

01:12:32.152 --> 01:12:34.059
I actually told you, it's
none of your business,

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.768
and I'm getting very
sick and tired of you.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:40.109
I am not going to feel bad
for your feelings today.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:43.168
It's my wedding day, okay, guys?

01:12:43.169 --> 01:12:44.617
- This is not about my feelings.

01:12:44.618 --> 01:12:47.508
This is about you marrying
someone you don't even love,

01:12:47.509 --> 01:12:50.819
someone, who for God knows
what reason, loves you.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.499
I don't understand what fun
you're getting out of this.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.539
- Do you want out of this wedding?

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.123
Because you can go.

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.602
- No.

01:13:00.603 --> 01:13:03.296
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:04.355
- Great.

01:13:04.356 --> 01:13:05.356
Awesome.

01:13:06.937 --> 01:13:08.186
Are we done now here?

01:13:08.187 --> 01:13:09.020
Shows over?

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:09.853
Can we finish getting ready?

01:13:09.854 --> 01:13:11.875
Because I'm tired.

01:13:11.876 --> 01:13:13.102
My hair looks crazy.

01:13:13.103 --> 01:13:16.020
Oh, sorry.

01:13:28.035 --> 01:13:29.373
- Hey, dude.

01:13:29.374 --> 01:13:31.274
How many times you gonna re-tie a tie?

01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:32.608
- Till I'm done.

01:13:34.442 --> 01:13:35.442
- Right.

01:13:40.744 --> 01:13:41.577
Look, man.

01:13:41.578 --> 01:13:42.962
The keys are in my right pocket, okay?

01:13:42.963 --> 01:13:44.583
I got a full tank of gas for ya.

01:13:44.584 --> 01:13:46.002
It's not too late to
just call this thing off.

01:13:46.003 --> 01:13:48.562
- I'm not doin' that, man.

01:13:48.563 --> 01:13:50.408
- Okay, fine.

01:13:50.409 --> 01:13:51.909
It's your funeral.

01:13:56.325 --> 01:13:57.368
- Okay.

01:13:57.369 --> 01:13:58.202
You know what?

01:13:58.203 --> 01:13:59.284
I'm gonna go to my bridal room,

01:13:59.285 --> 01:14:00.815
and please look out for David,

01:14:00.816 --> 01:14:02.153
because I can't have him see me.

01:14:02.154 --> 01:14:04.764
If he sees me, I'm gonna
flip my shit, okay?

01:14:04.765 --> 01:14:05.598
Okay.

01:14:05.598 --> 01:14:06.598
Bye.

01:14:08.976 --> 01:14:10.503
- Okay, good.

01:14:10.504 --> 01:14:12.054
I'm gonna go puke.

01:14:12.055 --> 01:14:15.193
- What's her problem?

01:14:15.194 --> 01:14:16.694
- Okay, you drink.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:21.014
- Oh, honey, you look so handsome.

01:14:21.015 --> 01:14:22.331
- Sorry.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.761
- Oh, hello, Ms. David.

01:14:23.762 --> 01:14:24.595
- Hello, sweetheart.

01:14:24.596 --> 01:14:25.671
Would you pick that up for him?

01:14:25.672 --> 01:14:27.140
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes.

01:14:27.141 --> 01:14:27.974
- Mr. Clumsy.

01:14:27.974 --> 01:14:28.807
- I know.

01:14:28.808 --> 01:14:30.608
Well, he never could tie his tie.

01:14:30.609 --> 01:14:31.658
- Yeah, he's inept.

01:14:31.659 --> 01:14:33.578
- Honey, you have to button your button.

01:14:33.579 --> 01:14:35.236
That's the problem.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:37.557
Now, yeah, you button this up.
- Yeah, right.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:38.757
- It's going to be,

01:14:38.758 --> 01:14:39.730
darling, it'll be fine.
- Hey guys, what's up?

01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:40.969
You guys are lookin' sharp.

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:41.887
Oh, thank you, yeah.

01:14:41.888 --> 01:14:43.024
- So let's get some good pictures,

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:45.052
so just remember, you know, happy day.

01:14:45.053 --> 01:14:45.886
- Happy day.

01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:47.133
- Lots of energy, lots of smiles, right?

01:14:47.134 --> 01:14:47.967
- Cool.

01:14:47.968 --> 01:14:48.975
- Actually, best man,
could I get you to help him

01:14:48.976 --> 01:14:50.025
with his tie real quick?

01:14:50.026 --> 01:14:50.859
- Yeah, sure.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.300
I might lose a finger, but whatever.

01:14:54.352 --> 01:14:56.543
Yeah, you're gonna remember
this day forever, buddy, huh?

01:14:56.544 --> 01:14:58.291
- Smile, sweetheart, smile.
- I got it.

01:14:58.292 --> 01:15:01.363
- This guy's great at smiles.
- Come on Drew.

01:15:01.364 --> 01:15:02.631
Yeah, there we go.
- I just saw your bride.

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:04.212
She looks amazing.

01:15:05.092 --> 01:15:06.500
- Could you,

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.334
give me a little,

01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:08.331
give me a little...

01:15:08.332 --> 01:15:10.071
Would you just back the fuck off?

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:10.905
- Whoa!

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:12.700
- Get the fuck out!

01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:15.125
- Hey, sorry, just...

01:15:15.126 --> 01:15:16.706
- Okay, no problem.

01:15:16.707 --> 01:15:19.575
- Honey, is everything okay?

01:15:19.576 --> 01:15:22.946
- Mom, out!

01:15:22.947 --> 01:15:25.034
- Oh, okay, honey.

01:15:25.035 --> 01:15:28.888
Well, I'll be out here
if you need anything.

01:15:28.889 --> 01:15:29.900
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:30.831
- No, no, it's okay.

01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:31.826
It's all right.

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.270
- Thank you, Ms. David.

01:15:35.414 --> 01:15:36.510
- Hey, listen.

01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:38.571
This wedding is your call right now, okay?

01:15:38.572 --> 01:15:41.350
If you wanna go back,
Mexico is a 12-hour drive,

01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:43.351
but in about 45 minutes,

01:15:44.296 --> 01:15:46.644
that's no longer gonna be an option,

01:15:46.645 --> 01:15:48.062
so what'll it be?

01:15:49.015 --> 01:15:52.848
- I'm not gonna do that, okay?

01:15:55.027 --> 01:15:58.232
Okay, fine.

01:15:58.233 --> 01:16:02.341
The photographer wasn't the
one screwing your bride, so...

01:16:02.342 --> 01:16:04.910
And who talks to their
mother that way, man?

01:16:04.911 --> 01:16:06.352
Seriously.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.353
Get it together.

01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:17.451
Oh!

01:16:20.269 --> 01:16:21.602
Congratulations.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:25.237
I guess I should say that.

01:16:26.599 --> 01:16:27.766
- Thanks, man.

01:16:29.413 --> 01:16:32.246
Guess you really are the best man.

01:16:39.407 --> 01:16:41.518
You ask TJ out yet?

01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:44.518
- What, do I have a sign on my forehead?

01:16:44.519 --> 01:16:45.737
- Yeah.

01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:46.821
Yeah, you do.

01:16:51.359 --> 01:16:54.417
- You got this, Drew.

01:16:54.418 --> 01:16:55.736
- Okay, guys.

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.078
We need to rally.

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.348
We never have to come
back to this moment again,

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:02.478
so let's just power through.

01:17:02.479 --> 01:17:04.627
- To fucked-up relationships.

01:17:04.628 --> 01:17:06.467
- Here here!

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.307
♫ Oh no, oh no

01:17:23.308 --> 01:17:27.136
♫ It seems that I disappeared

01:17:27.137 --> 01:17:28.896
♫ Off the face of the earth

01:17:28.897 --> 01:17:31.122
♫ Oh no, oh no

01:17:31.123 --> 01:17:34.518
♫ All of my fears are being confirmed

01:17:34.519 --> 01:17:36.990
♫ And boy, does it hurt

01:17:36.991 --> 01:17:38.899
♫ Oh no

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.900
♫ Oh no

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:46.248
♫ Oh no

01:17:46.249 --> 01:17:48.249
♫ Oh no

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:54.798
♫ I'm startin' to feel neglected

01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:58.397
♫ I'm startin' to feel distraught

01:17:58.398 --> 01:18:01.990
♫ I'm startin' to feel infected

01:18:01.991 --> 01:18:06.608
♫ From all of this fever I've got

01:18:06.609 --> 01:18:09.192
♫ Oh no, oh no

01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:16.693
♫ Oh no, oh no

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:39.328
♫ Oh no, oh no

01:18:39.329 --> 01:18:41.878
♫ I don't wanna complain

01:18:41.879 --> 01:18:44.009
- Please be seated.

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.331
Welcome, everyone

01:18:46.332 --> 01:18:49.165
to the wedding of David and Nella.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:54.991
I know that they are excited
that each of you are here,

01:18:54.992 --> 01:18:56.951
as friends of theirs,

01:18:56.952 --> 01:19:00.671
to witness the most
important day of their life,

01:19:00.672 --> 01:19:03.922
and I know they thank you, each of you.

01:19:05.442 --> 01:19:08.231
In a moment, we are
going to say a few words

01:19:08.232 --> 01:19:11.815
that will begin a
lifetime of wedded bliss.

01:19:13.002 --> 01:19:16.169
We'll get started without further ado.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.853
- When you're a kid,

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:20.881
your parents have to
teach you to say I'm sorry

01:19:20.882 --> 01:19:25.454
and I forgive you, because
it's a part of growing up.

01:19:25.455 --> 01:19:26.803
- Is the promise between
♫ When I was a girl

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.384
two people who love each other

01:19:28.385 --> 01:19:31.104
♫ My mother, she told me

01:19:31.105 --> 01:19:33.754
♫ Child, if you're good,

01:19:33.755 --> 01:19:36.314
♫ You can be anything

01:19:36.315 --> 01:19:39.125
♫ That you wanna be

01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:41.824
♫ Now I'm grown and I know

01:19:41.825 --> 01:19:43.213
♫ It's a lie

01:19:43.214 --> 01:19:44.445
♫ It's a lie

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.784
♫ It's a lie

01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:47.423
- This ceremony will not create

01:19:47.424 --> 01:19:48.257
a relationship...

01:19:48.258 --> 01:19:49.505
- Most the time as a kid,

01:19:49.506 --> 01:19:51.305
you don't wanna forgive someone,

01:19:51.306 --> 01:19:52.985
because it's easy to believe someone

01:19:52.986 --> 01:19:54.922
doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.395
- That relationship began

01:19:56.396 --> 01:19:59.693
when you met each other in high school,

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:02.915
and that relationship has now blossomed

01:20:02.916 --> 01:20:05.875
to the point that you're willing to commit

01:20:05.876 --> 01:20:09.323
to spending the rest
of your lives together.

01:20:09.324 --> 01:20:10.397
No matter what challenges you
face in the future, you'll...

01:20:10.398 --> 01:20:13.014
♫ When I was a girl

01:20:13.015 --> 01:20:14.072
- It isn't until
♫ My mother

01:20:14.073 --> 01:20:15.208
you truly forgive someone

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:16.725
that you then understand.
♫ She told me

01:20:16.726 --> 01:20:17.559
It's not about excusing

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.544
their bad behavior.
♫ Child, if your good

01:20:19.545 --> 01:20:20.946
It's just giving yourself
♫ You can be

01:20:20.947 --> 01:20:23.024
permission to let go.
♫ Anything

01:20:23.025 --> 01:20:24.663
- Anyone here
♫ That you wanna be

01:20:24.664 --> 01:20:25.655
should know of any reason

01:20:25.656 --> 01:20:27.173
♫ Now I'm grown and I know

01:20:27.174 --> 01:20:29.188
why these two would not be wedded today,

01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:30.963
♫ It's a lie
speak now

01:20:30.964 --> 01:20:35.131
♫ It's a lie, it's a lie
or forever hold your peace.

01:20:55.241 --> 01:21:00.060
♫ Well you try to shed a
light on all this information

01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:04.551
♫ And you still can the see the
right despite your situation

01:21:04.552 --> 01:21:07.299
♫ But you're wasting all your time

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.442
♫ You're wasting all your time

01:21:09.443 --> 01:21:11.581
♫ And you're wilting in your prime

01:21:11.582 --> 01:21:14.333
♫ And you just don't seem to mind

01:21:14.334 --> 01:21:16.900
♫ Please

01:21:16.901 --> 01:21:21.401
♫ Go on and stop me if
my tongue's too rough

01:21:21.402 --> 01:21:26.042
♫ And interrupt me if I talk too much

01:21:26.043 --> 01:21:29.793
♫ I never wanted that for us

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:35.122
♫ These

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:39.834
♫ Cries ricochet off of our empty walls

01:21:39.835 --> 01:21:44.314
♫ Just simple matters
that we can't resolve

01:21:44.315 --> 01:21:48.315
♫ They made a mockery of us all

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:57.042
♫ Oh

01:21:59.584 --> 01:22:01.417
♫ Ooh

01:22:04.144 --> 01:22:05.894
♫ Oh

01:22:08.493 --> 01:22:13.132

01:23:56.337 --> 01:23:57.653
♫ Forget where you come from

01:23:57.654 --> 01:23:58.605
♫ Live again

01:23:58.606 --> 01:24:00.008

♫ Go on and stop me if
my tongue's too rough

01:24:15.132 --> 01:24:19.623
♫ And interrupt me if I talk too much

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:23.374
♫ I never wanted that for us

01:24:26.304 --> 01:24:29.043
♫ These

01:24:29.044 --> 01:24:33.472
♫ Cries ricochet off our empty walls

01:24:33.473 --> 01:24:38.083
♫ Just simple matters
that we can't resolve

01:24:38.084 --> 01:24:42.084
♫ They made a mockery of us all

01:24:46.575 --> 01:24:47.969
