00:00.069 --> 00:01.265
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.370 --> 00:03.680
I'm not at World's because
I decided not to go.

00:03.838 --> 00:05.450
Nobody wants you on their team, Mariana.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.613
You have a junior team?

00:06.648 --> 00:09.115
As if our moms would let
us play a contact sport.

00:09.151 --> 00:10.316
Why treat girls any different?

00:10.352 --> 00:12.185
There are so many unknowns

00:12.220 --> 00:13.553
about traumatic brain injuries.

00:13.588 --> 00:16.389
I told you that you shouldn't
get involved with me.

00:16.425 --> 00:17.457
That I had a kid.

00:17.492 --> 00:19.426
You should do one thing
a day that scares you.

00:19.461 --> 00:20.693
Guys, this is Cole.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.196
Yet you won't date me, because
you don't see me as a guy.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.330
Uh, this is Dawn.

00:24.366 --> 00:25.498
Callie saw AJ kissing another girl.

00:25.534 --> 00:28.334
I love you, Callie, but
it shouldn't be so hard.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.103
I know you're going
through a lot right now,

00:30.138 --> 00:32.439
and I know you don't want attachments.

00:47.489 --> 00:48.555
Congratulations.

00:49.156 --> 00:50.256
_

00:50.258 --> 00:53.126
Engineering award, that's, uh...

00:53.161 --> 00:55.295
- big deal.
- Thanks.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.263
Your name should really be on there.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.299
Is it true Drew shut down STEAM

00:59.334 --> 01:01.434
'cause you crashed our drone in a tree?

01:01.470 --> 01:03.436
It's a temporary ban,

01:03.472 --> 01:06.072
and I didn't crash it.

01:06.108 --> 01:09.209
Well, we're gonna keep
doing STEAM off campus.

01:09.244 --> 01:10.510
We'll let you know when and where...

01:10.545 --> 01:12.245
not.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.180
- Emma!
- It's okay.

01:14.216 --> 01:17.383
I don't really have
time for STEAM anyways.

01:17.419 --> 01:19.452
I'm trying something new.

01:19.488 --> 01:21.521
It's gonna really stand out on
my college applications, so...

01:23.325 --> 01:26.426
uh, congrats again on the award.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.462
I know how hard you guys worked on it.

01:39.174 --> 01:41.508
- That's his new girlfriend, huh?
- Yep.

01:41.543 --> 01:43.243
He doesn't waste any time.

01:43.278 --> 01:45.311
No time at all, as a matter of fact.

01:45.347 --> 01:47.313
So, he was cheating on you?

01:47.349 --> 01:48.414
Whatever. It's my fault.

01:48.450 --> 01:50.316
How is that your fault?

01:50.352 --> 01:52.552
Brandon, you know I make
everything harder than it has to be.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.357
Uh, he is coming this way.

01:57.392 --> 01:58.625
Do you want me to stay or...

01:58.660 --> 02:01.194
No, it's okay. You can go.

02:01.229 --> 02:03.229
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

02:03.265 --> 02:05.198
Hey.

02:05.233 --> 02:08.467
Mike told me Troy Johnson confessed.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.336
You were right about him.

02:10.372 --> 02:14.107
Yeah, but I was wrong about
a lot of other things, so...

02:14.142 --> 02:15.408
I gotta get to class.

02:20.482 --> 02:24.083
Is there a story about
Jesus and a baseball bat?

02:24.119 --> 02:25.151
Uh, why?

02:25.187 --> 02:27.320
I saw your door was smashed in.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.454
Did he do that?

02:31.226 --> 02:33.126
So, uh, as you can see here,

02:33.161 --> 02:36.129
we're still seeing a fair
amount of neuro inflammation,

02:36.164 --> 02:39.365
meaning he has to stay
on his anti-seizure meds.

02:39.401 --> 02:42.268
Doc, I can't even get it up.

02:42.304 --> 02:43.313
Jesus!

02:43.338 --> 02:45.271
You can see there's still

02:45.307 --> 02:47.240
a little issue of impulse control.

02:47.275 --> 02:49.509
There have been emotional
outbursts as... as well.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.511
Yeah. They're afraid of me, so...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.279
Why do you say that?

02:53.315 --> 02:56.182
Because I heard you telling
Mom about what a monster I am.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.450
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

02:57.485 --> 02:58.585
That is not what she said.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.253
- Yeah, it is what she said.
- No, it's not.

03:00.288 --> 03:02.288
She said that she thought
that I was dangerous.

03:02.324 --> 03:03.523
Honey, that's not what I meant.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.191
Um...

03:05.227 --> 03:07.227
Mom and I are simply concerned

03:07.262 --> 03:09.095
about your ability to control

03:09.130 --> 03:10.430
your aggression, love.

03:10.465 --> 03:12.498
The last time he went
off his ADHD medication,

03:12.534 --> 03:14.267
he also had some anger issues.

03:14.302 --> 03:17.136
Do you think it might help
if he went back on them?

03:17.172 --> 03:18.304
I think it's possible.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.106
Let's try a low dose.

03:20.141 --> 03:23.109
But what are we gonna
do about my... problem?

03:23.144 --> 03:25.178
We can try other anti-seizure meds,

03:25.213 --> 03:27.313
that may not have that effect of you.

03:28.350 --> 03:29.482
Sweet.

03:29.517 --> 03:31.184
We do need some bloodwork, though.

03:31.219 --> 03:32.228
Sarah will take you.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.520
Okay. Thanks, Doc.

03:39.461 --> 03:43.096
Why isn't this getting any better?

03:43.131 --> 03:45.365
Isn't the... the... the
brain gonna heal itself?

03:45.400 --> 03:47.200
When brain cells are damaged,

03:47.235 --> 03:49.535
or destroyed, they don't regenerate,

03:49.571 --> 03:52.372
but the brain does reorganize itself.

03:52.407 --> 03:54.540
We're seeing great
improvements in him physically,

03:54.576 --> 03:56.409
but emotionally...

03:59.581 --> 04:01.414
What's wrong, baby?

04:01.449 --> 04:04.250
Sorry, I got... I, uh...

04:04.286 --> 04:06.352
I just want our sweet boy back.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.520
I know.

04:07.555 --> 04:12.425
You just... may have to
manage your expectations.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.227
And his.

04:14.262 --> 04:17.063
Cause there's no pill
or combination of pills

04:17.098 --> 04:19.065
that's gonna make him who he used to be.

04:22.504 --> 04:23.536
Okay, thank you.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.283
Hey, girl.

05:10.318 --> 05:12.418
Lisa. This is Mariana.

05:12.454 --> 05:14.420
- Fresh meat.
- Ooh.

05:14.456 --> 05:16.189
Fresh what?

05:16.224 --> 05:18.257
New blood. Nice, welcome.

05:18.293 --> 05:20.259
Ooh! What's in the box?

05:20.295 --> 05:23.129
Are you seriously that
desperate to win everyone over?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.532
Girl, she's just bustin' your ovaries.

05:26.568 --> 05:28.101
Oh, yeah, I'm just kiddin'.

05:28.136 --> 05:29.435
I love pan dulce.

05:29.471 --> 05:31.070
Yum.

05:31.106 --> 05:33.373
Picoteando? En serio?

05:33.408 --> 05:35.241
How about we save these
for after practice, ladies?

05:35.276 --> 05:37.543
Hey, uh, can I practice
with the jammers today?

05:37.579 --> 05:39.145
Poppy, we have enough jammers.

05:39.180 --> 05:40.279
Okay? We need blockers.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.384
Gear up. Let's see what you got.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.185
What's this?

05:46.221 --> 05:48.354
Butt pad. You're gonna need it.

05:55.597 --> 05:58.498
What was that?

05:58.533 --> 06:01.167
You know, if we were at my place,

06:01.202 --> 06:04.170
you wouldn't have to freak
out every time you hear a bump.

06:04.205 --> 06:06.372
Well, I've never been invited.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.341
Um, it's a loft...

06:08.376 --> 06:10.510
not a dinner party.
You're welcome any time.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.080
Okay.

06:14.115 --> 06:16.149
Then, we can really be alone.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.190
Hey, Aaron!

06:24.225 --> 06:26.058
Hi, Mrs. Adams Foster.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.193
Stef is fine.

06:27.228 --> 06:28.237
And Callie I wanted to tell you

06:28.263 --> 06:30.263
that I saw Cole at
the LGBT center today.

06:30.331 --> 06:31.531
What were you doing there?

06:31.566 --> 06:33.366
Just some outreach for work.

06:33.401 --> 06:35.268
Anyway, Cole said hello,

06:35.303 --> 06:37.470
and that he would love
to see you sometime.

06:37.505 --> 06:38.538
Yeah, I'll text him.

06:38.573 --> 06:40.306
Uh, don't forget you're on dinner duty.

06:40.341 --> 06:41.441
Veggies aren't gonna wash themselves.

06:41.476 --> 06:43.276
It was good to see you, Aaron.

06:43.311 --> 06:44.377
Nice to see you, too.

06:48.149 --> 06:49.449
I, uh...

06:49.484 --> 06:51.551
forgot that you know Cole.

06:51.586 --> 06:53.219
Does he know that we're... ?

06:54.522 --> 06:56.155
Um...

06:56.191 --> 06:57.323
I mean, I don't think so.

06:57.358 --> 06:59.225
I haven't really talked to him, since...

07:00.295 --> 07:02.195
And that wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact

07:02.230 --> 07:04.330
that he has, like, a
massive crush on you, right?

07:04.365 --> 07:07.133
What? N... no, he doesn't.

07:07.168 --> 07:09.268
Uh, yes, he does.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.071
Maybe he used to, like, a little bit,

07:12.106 --> 07:15.041
but I'm sure he's past it.

07:16.177 --> 07:18.211
Why? Are you jealous?

07:18.246 --> 07:20.513
- No.
- Mm-hmm. Are you sure?

07:20.548 --> 07:24.383
Uh, well, why don't you come
to my place and find out?

07:24.419 --> 07:26.319
Okay.

07:34.429 --> 07:36.162
Let's go, ladies!

07:36.197 --> 07:38.197
I wanna see you kicking some ass!

07:38.233 --> 07:39.432
Now, drive!

07:39.467 --> 07:42.235
Drive! Come on! Use
that outside leg to push.

07:43.271 --> 07:45.338
Poppy! What's going on with you?

07:45.373 --> 07:47.306
Pick up the speed. You're being lazy.

07:49.477 --> 07:51.077
Keep it up, keep it up.

07:57.252 --> 07:59.252
- You okay?
- Yeah, all good.

08:00.288 --> 08:04.023
Remember, derby stance
is bent at the knees.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.258
Almost in a squat,

08:05.293 --> 08:06.492
but upright with your torso.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.261
Butt in, boobs out.

08:08.296 --> 08:09.428
Got it?

08:09.464 --> 08:10.496
Ready for more?

08:10.532 --> 08:12.465
Yeah, you are. Come on.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.366
Good.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.274
So, they're gonna adjust my meds,

08:55.310 --> 08:57.243
and then, I should be, like,

08:57.278 --> 08:58.477
you know, back to normal.

08:58.513 --> 09:00.379
That's awesome.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.149
- You comin' over later?
- I'll try.

09:03.184 --> 09:04.317
I'm kind of on east coast time,

09:04.352 --> 09:06.018
and I have a ton of homework.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.221
Yo, Jesus! What's up, bro?

09:09.257 --> 09:12.258
Are we, like... okay?

09:12.293 --> 09:13.312
Yeah, what do you mean?

09:13.328 --> 09:15.061
Come on, Emma. Wh... what's going on?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.163
Look... can we talk about this later?

09:17.198 --> 09:18.217
No, we can't.

09:18.232 --> 09:19.251
You've been blowing me off

09:19.267 --> 09:21.467
since, like, before you left for Worlds.

09:23.371 --> 09:25.338
I know what you did to Brandon's door...

09:25.373 --> 09:27.473
and to his keyboard.

09:27.508 --> 09:30.142
And it scares me that...

09:30.178 --> 09:32.044
you would do something like that.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.280
You... you have nothing to be scared of.

09:34.315 --> 09:36.449
I would never hurt you,

09:36.484 --> 09:38.117
or... or anyone.

09:39.387 --> 09:43.089
Wow. This lineup is ridiculous.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.191
- Right?
- It's so good.

09:45.226 --> 09:46.850
You know, I always
wanted to go to Coachella.

09:46.996 --> 09:50.262
Me, too. My parents never
let me go to concerts.

09:51.566 --> 09:55.468
Actually, they did take me
to go see Neil Diamond once.

09:55.503 --> 09:57.303
- Really?
- Yep.

09:57.338 --> 10:00.139
- For my birthday.
- Wow.

10:00.174 --> 10:02.108
I think they just think
that music festivals

10:02.143 --> 10:04.243
are all about drugs, sex,

10:04.278 --> 10:06.379
and... people standing
around in the dirt.

10:06.414 --> 10:09.081
Mmm. Mmm, right.

10:10.585 --> 10:13.085
Should we go?

10:13.121 --> 10:14.353
Together?

10:16.224 --> 10:17.823
I mean, you know, you
don't have to decide, like,

10:17.824 --> 10:19.191
right now, or anything.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.259
It's three months away, but...

10:20.294 --> 10:22.395
No, no, no. We should totally go.

10:22.430 --> 10:23.596
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:23.631 --> 10:26.198
I mean, we have to get the
tickets and... and pay for them.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.200
Yeah. It'll be fun, right?

10:28.236 --> 10:30.169
Yeah. It will.

10:30.204 --> 10:32.571
Hey! Why can't you just
keep your mouth shut, man?

10:32.607 --> 10:34.206
Whoa, whoa, dude. Relax.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.242
No, you relax. Why would you tell Emma

10:36.277 --> 10:38.210
about... about your stupid, little room?

10:38.246 --> 10:39.278
- Why? So she'd break up with me?
- What?

10:39.313 --> 10:40.346
She overheard Mama talking.

10:40.381 --> 10:42.214
Specifically about your keyboard?

10:42.250 --> 10:43.315
Come on, man. Who told her that?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.317
- Whoa, wait, stop it.
- Brandon, stop it!

10:45.353 --> 10:47.186
You want him to fall
and hit his head again?

10:47.221 --> 10:48.421
Well, he started it! He shoved me first!

10:48.456 --> 10:50.423
He's got a TBI. What
is the matter with you?

10:54.195 --> 10:56.595
Come on, let's go back
to the house. Come on.

10:56.631 --> 10:58.464
Let's go.

11:10.517 --> 11:12.216
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:12.252 --> 11:15.053
So, I was wondering, maybe...

11:15.088 --> 11:17.488
why don't you come and stay
with me for a couple nights?

11:17.524 --> 11:19.390
You know, until
everyone kinda cools off.

11:19.426 --> 11:21.192
I... I mean, if it's
cool with your parents.

11:21.227 --> 11:24.362
- Um...
- You don't have to. It's just I...

11:24.397 --> 11:26.230
No! No, I... I... I want to.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.332
Um...

11:27.367 --> 11:29.334
My... my moms will be cool with it.

11:29.369 --> 11:31.202
I... I think it's a good
idea, actually, you know,

11:31.237 --> 11:33.371
to give Jesus some space.

11:33.406 --> 11:36.274
I mean, he should be the
one giving you space, right?

11:36.309 --> 11:38.309
Yeah, well, I shouldn't have pushed him.

11:38.345 --> 11:39.444
I know, but you're human.

11:39.479 --> 11:42.080
You just reacted. I
would've done the same thing.

11:42.115 --> 11:44.449
Alright, well, I'm at
my dad's for dinner,

11:44.484 --> 11:47.051
and then I can come to you.

11:47.087 --> 11:48.419
I can text you when I'm on my way.

11:48.455 --> 11:50.388
Okay. I will see you later.

11:50.423 --> 11:52.523
Hey, uh, thanks.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.579
Yep.

11:57.230 --> 12:00.098
- So, I'll see you...
- When you see me.

12:10.343 --> 12:13.144
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

12:13.179 --> 12:15.246
I'm just gonna get a
shower before dinner.

12:15.281 --> 12:16.381
Mm-hmm.

12:23.189 --> 12:25.356
So, you coming back?

12:25.392 --> 12:27.158
Not everyone does.

12:27.193 --> 12:29.127
Oh, uh...

12:29.162 --> 12:31.129
Yeah. Probably.

12:31.164 --> 12:32.497
Probably?

12:32.532 --> 12:37.101
I'm just not really good at not
being good at things, you know?

12:37.137 --> 12:38.469
Look, you don't have
to be great to start,

12:38.505 --> 12:42.073
but you got to start
somewhere to be great, right?

12:42.108 --> 12:45.176
Okay. You totally stole
that off an Instagram post.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.377
A t-shirt.

12:46.413 --> 12:49.247
Hey, you wanna catch a movie
or something this weekend?

12:49.282 --> 12:51.149
Sure.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.054
Dinner's ready.

12:56.089 --> 12:58.189
Oh, okay. Uh, I'm hungry.

12:58.224 --> 13:00.091
What are we having?

13:03.496 --> 13:06.464
Wait till you taste these.

13:06.499 --> 13:08.399
They're the best
enchiladas I've ever had.

13:08.435 --> 13:10.301
Oh, they look great.

13:10.336 --> 13:12.170
Hey, are y'all still
going out tomorrow night?

13:12.205 --> 13:14.138
What's tomorrow night?

13:14.174 --> 13:16.074
Date night.

13:16.109 --> 13:19.243
You said there was a new
place you wanted to take me.

13:19.279 --> 13:21.479
- I did?
- Uh, yeah.

13:21.514 --> 13:24.182
- Can you still sit?
- Yeah, that's no problem.

13:24.217 --> 13:27.118
AJ, who was that girl I
saw leaving when I got home?

13:27.153 --> 13:28.319
Just a study buddy.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.021
Mmm. With benefits.

13:31.091 --> 13:32.323
What happened with Dawn?

13:32.358 --> 13:34.158
Nothing. We're just not exclusive.

13:34.194 --> 13:35.426
Does Dawn know that?

13:35.462 --> 13:37.195
- That's what she wanted.
- Interesting.

13:37.230 --> 13:38.760
I find that most girls
want to be exclusive

13:38.935 --> 13:40.034
even if they say they don't.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.903
Well, then, it's up to
her to say something.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.874
Oh, well, maybe it's
because you had a girlfriend

13:45.909 --> 13:47.275
when you two started hooking up,

13:47.310 --> 13:49.811
and she was afraid to say anything.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.814
Callie told you that?

13:52.849 --> 13:53.982
Is it not true?

13:54.017 --> 13:55.216
It's not your business is what it is.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.120
I have to say I agree with Brandon.

13:59.155 --> 14:02.123
I think most women
are, generally speaking,

14:02.158 --> 14:04.058
naturally monogamous.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.894
Really?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.095
That's pretty sexist.

14:07.130 --> 14:10.131
Not every woman wants a
committed relationship.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.800
I mean, you don't have to marry a girl

14:12.836 --> 14:13.935
just because you sleep with her.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.937
Or move in and raise her kid.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.143
I'm not talking about y'all.

14:22.178 --> 14:23.211
It's fine.

14:23.246 --> 14:25.046
I... I think the point is

14:25.081 --> 14:28.182
there's no reason to
rush into a commitment.

14:28.218 --> 14:29.951
You know, when you move too fast

14:29.986 --> 14:32.820
you can get in over your
head before you know someone.

14:32.856 --> 14:34.122
Brandon and I are, uh...

14:34.157 --> 14:36.057
old school when it comes to women.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.125
We're "all or nothing" guys,

14:37.160 --> 14:38.259
and there's nothing wrong with that.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.966
Hey, Dad, uh...

14:45.001 --> 14:47.001
is it cool that I maybe
stay here for a few days?

14:47.037 --> 14:49.237
Yeah. Is everything okay at home?

14:54.910 --> 14:58.981
_

15:02.252 --> 15:04.919
_

15:10.210 --> 15:11.610
_

15:28.278 --> 15:30.778
- Hey.
- Hey, Brandon.

15:30.814 --> 15:32.080
Um...

15:32.115 --> 15:35.049
Look, I'm... I'm really
sorry to call, but...

15:35.085 --> 15:36.250
I kinda need your help.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.720
It is so good to see
you. You look great.

15:43.762 --> 15:45.762
So do you. It's been too long.

15:45.797 --> 15:47.664
I know. My mom told me that

15:47.699 --> 15:49.866
you've been working at
the center full-time.

15:49.901 --> 15:52.469
Uh, yeah, yeah. It's been great.

15:52.504 --> 15:53.570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:53.605 --> 15:54.738
So, tell me everything.

15:54.773 --> 15:56.506
- Everything?
- Yeah.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.841
That could take a while.

15:57.876 --> 15:59.743
Well, are you seeing anyone?

15:59.778 --> 16:02.445
I am, kinda, yeah.

16:02.481 --> 16:04.514
- What's her name?
- Marissa.

16:04.549 --> 16:05.849
She's... she's pretty great.

16:05.884 --> 16:08.485
And you're blushing, so
you must really like her.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.552
I do.

16:09.588 --> 16:11.654
But what about you?
Are you still with AJ?

16:11.690 --> 16:15.692
Um, no. I'm actually,
uh, seeing someone else.

16:15.727 --> 16:19.562
Um, Aaron. You know him, right?

16:19.598 --> 16:20.617
Aaron?

16:21.666 --> 16:23.433
Aaron Baker?

16:23.468 --> 16:24.801
Yeah.

16:24.836 --> 16:26.736
Cool.

16:26.772 --> 16:29.439
So, is it serious, or... ?

16:29.474 --> 16:31.608
Well, I mean, we just started
seeing each other, so...

16:34.746 --> 16:35.812
What?

16:37.516 --> 16:40.650
I guess I'm just
surprised that you're...

16:41.686 --> 16:42.819
dating a guy who's...

16:42.854 --> 16:44.888
I told you that wasn't...

16:44.923 --> 16:47.457
I guess I didn't totally believe you.

16:47.492 --> 16:49.826
It was easier in thinking it
was me who was the problem.

16:49.861 --> 16:51.761
Cole.

16:51.797 --> 16:55.565
Wait, wait, there was
never any problem, okay?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.834
- We were friends.
- Well, weren't you friends with Aaron, too?

16:59.871 --> 17:02.472
Look...

17:02.507 --> 17:04.641
it's all good. I'm seeing
someone. You're seeing someone.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.643
I'm happy for you,

17:06.678 --> 17:08.845
and Aaron's a great guy
from what I can tell.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.882
So, like, how's it going?

17:12.917 --> 17:15.551
It's good, yeah.

17:15.587 --> 17:17.554
Um...

17:17.589 --> 17:18.788
just we haven't...

17:18.824 --> 17:19.856
you know.

17:19.891 --> 17:21.758
Um...

17:21.792 --> 17:26.463
I think we probably are going to...

17:26.498 --> 17:27.517
soon.

17:27.531 --> 17:28.698
Have sex?

17:28.733 --> 17:30.567
Is this weird?

17:30.602 --> 17:32.502
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

17:33.572 --> 17:34.671
But I'm your friend.

17:36.808 --> 17:40.643
Okay, um, well, like, I don't, um...

17:40.679 --> 17:41.778
know what to do.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.880
You know, like... uh, like...

17:43.915 --> 17:47.484
I don't know what's okay
and what's not, um...

17:47.519 --> 17:48.618
like what's he's gonna like

17:48.653 --> 17:50.620
or what he's not gonna like.

17:50.655 --> 17:51.855
Are you asking me?

17:51.890 --> 17:54.824
I just, like, don't have
anyone else to talk to.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.526
Um...

17:56.561 --> 17:58.862
- I mean, no one knows he's trans, so...
- It's okay.

17:58.897 --> 18:00.530
What do you wanna know?

18:04.536 --> 18:05.835
Yeah, girl!

18:05.871 --> 18:07.837
Looking good, Mariana!

18:07.873 --> 18:09.873
Great speed, too.

18:09.908 --> 18:11.708
I think we've got a future jammer here.

18:11.743 --> 18:14.544
Jammer? Is that a good thing?

18:14.579 --> 18:17.413
The jammer's the only person
who can score during a bout.

18:17.449 --> 18:18.515
It's a great thing.

18:19.751 --> 18:21.551
Alright, ladies!

18:21.586 --> 18:22.886
Falling drills.

18:22.921 --> 18:26.422
Oh, uh, I thought the
whole idea was not to fall.

18:26.458 --> 18:27.524
Well, falling's inevitable.

18:27.559 --> 18:28.791
The idea is to fall the right way.

18:43.642 --> 18:44.874
Hey.

18:46.845 --> 18:48.444
Sorry.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.513
I didn't think anyone was home.

18:50.549 --> 18:51.748
What are you looking for?

18:55.620 --> 18:58.454
I... walked in on Mike last night,

18:58.490 --> 19:00.823
and he shoved something in the
drawer like he'd been caught.

19:00.859 --> 19:02.759
And you know, he's an addict,

19:02.794 --> 19:04.494
and so am I, and...

19:04.529 --> 19:06.796
anyway, I thought, maybe,
he was drinking again.

19:06.831 --> 19:08.731
So, did you find anything?

19:10.602 --> 19:11.734
This.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.469
Whoa.

19:15.707 --> 19:16.806
It's date night.

19:20.879 --> 19:22.545
Hey!

19:22.581 --> 19:24.480
Uh, didn't you get my texts?

19:24.516 --> 19:26.516
No, I left my phone at home.

19:26.551 --> 19:28.751
I'm living without
electronics for 24 hours.

19:28.787 --> 19:31.654
It's my one thing that
scares me for today.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.456
- Is everything okay?
- Uh, yeah.

19:33.491 --> 19:36.726
No, I... I... I just... uh,
I'm sorry, I can't hang today.

19:36.761 --> 19:38.795
Oh, okay.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.430
Why?

19:40.465 --> 19:41.497
Uh...

19:42.567 --> 19:43.733
Mason, not in the face.

19:43.768 --> 19:45.535
Not in the...

19:45.570 --> 19:46.803
- Hi, cutie.
- Thank you.

19:46.838 --> 19:47.857
Hi.

19:47.872 --> 19:51.841
I... my friend needed
a last minute babysitter,

19:51.876 --> 19:53.643
and I... I just... I couldn't say no.

19:53.678 --> 19:54.811
- So...
- Oh.

19:54.846 --> 19:56.913
Hit the larger strikes!

19:56.948 --> 19:58.715
Mason, no, hey! Not... not upstairs.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.718
Looks like you could use some help.

20:01.753 --> 20:05.688
Look, if you feel like Aaron's really
uncomfortable talking about sex,

20:05.724 --> 20:06.856
then go slow.

20:06.891 --> 20:08.791
Next time you guys are making out,

20:08.827 --> 20:10.493
maybe go to tug on his shirt,

20:10.528 --> 20:12.462
and see if he makes
the move to take it off.

20:12.497 --> 20:15.498
And then, make sure he knows
that you're still really into him.

20:15.533 --> 20:16.933
I like it when my girlfriend,

20:17.969 --> 20:20.837
you know, talks about
how masculine I am.

20:20.905 --> 20:22.772
So...

20:22.807 --> 20:24.841
what about you?

20:24.876 --> 20:25.895
Huh?

20:25.910 --> 20:27.710
Have you thought about what you want?

20:31.449 --> 20:32.982
Mason.

20:35.982 --> 20:37.165
Mason.

20:37.984 --> 20:39.684
Where...

20:41.087 --> 20:43.621
are you?

20:43.656 --> 20:44.755
- Go, go!
- No, no!

20:44.791 --> 20:45.923
Oh! No, no, no, no!

20:45.959 --> 20:47.792
No! No! Oh, God!

20:49.996 --> 20:51.863
No! Ah ah!

20:57.737 --> 20:59.003
No, no.

20:59.038 --> 21:01.639
Ohhh, you got me.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.650
Um, I'll catch up with you guys.

21:14.687 --> 21:15.753
Hey, man!

21:18.925 --> 21:20.057
What are you doing here?

21:20.093 --> 21:21.792
Look, I gotta know.

21:22.829 --> 21:28.032
- Are we done?
- I don't... think so.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.067
I... I mean, I don't want to be, but...

21:30.103 --> 21:31.502
But what?

21:31.638 --> 21:33.604
You don't have to be afraid of me.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.640
Emma, I'm not mad at you. I...

21:40.513 --> 21:41.779
I think you are.

21:43.616 --> 21:45.450
I don't think you're mad

21:45.485 --> 21:46.851
that Brandon took me to get an abortion.

21:46.886 --> 21:48.786
I think you're mad that I had one.

21:48.822 --> 21:51.489
Yeah, I'm mad that you
didn't tell me about it.

21:51.524 --> 21:52.690
Why?

21:52.726 --> 21:54.559
Do you think that would
have made a difference?

21:54.594 --> 21:56.494
I don't know.

21:56.529 --> 21:57.829
Mariana told me...

21:57.864 --> 22:00.398
that you never wanted to
be like your birth parents

22:00.433 --> 22:01.599
because they abandoned you

22:01.634 --> 22:04.535
and that if you were
in their same position,

22:04.571 --> 22:06.571
you would be a dad to
your kid no matter what.

22:08.742 --> 22:09.841
Is that how you feel?

22:11.644 --> 22:12.810
I guess. Yeah.

22:14.814 --> 22:16.581
Then how can you not be mad at me

22:16.616 --> 22:18.483
if that's something you really believe?

22:18.518 --> 22:20.818
If you...

22:20.854 --> 22:22.720
really think...

22:22.756 --> 22:24.756
that you were capable

22:24.791 --> 22:27.625
of taking care of a baby at 16...

22:27.660 --> 22:29.660
Okay. Yes. Maybe I am angry

22:29.696 --> 22:32.730
that you didn't ask me about
how I felt before you did it.

22:32.766 --> 22:34.799
And maybe, I think, that you did it

22:34.834 --> 22:37.568
not because of my TBI,

22:37.604 --> 22:39.704
but because you didn't want
to hear what I had to say,

22:39.739 --> 22:41.405
because you wouldn't care,
'cause you didn't care,

22:41.441 --> 22:43.775
because you just would
go and do it anyway.

22:43.810 --> 22:46.544
I would have done it
anyway, because it's my body.

22:48.548 --> 22:49.781
I was on the pill.

22:50.884 --> 22:52.550
It was not my fault.

22:52.585 --> 22:55.586
I didn't know that some
herb could cancel it out.

22:55.622 --> 22:57.688
And even if it was my fault,

22:57.724 --> 22:58.890
it's my choice,

22:58.925 --> 23:00.525
it's my life,

23:00.560 --> 23:02.693
and I'm not ready to be pregnant,

23:02.729 --> 23:04.662
I'm not ready to raise a baby,

23:04.697 --> 23:07.465
and I'm not ready to
give one up for adoption.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.469
And I can't be with you if you
feel angry or betrayed by that.

23:12.322 --> 23:13.354
And I also can't be with you

23:13.390 --> 23:15.223
if you keep tormenting your brother,

23:15.258 --> 23:16.591
because he was only
trying to be there for me.

23:16.626 --> 23:19.594
He wasn't just trying to help me.

23:19.629 --> 23:22.230
He was trying to help you...

23:22.265 --> 23:23.431
because he loves you.

23:26.469 --> 23:28.436
Okay, I... I...

23:28.471 --> 23:32.173
Don't. Don't say anything.

23:33.343 --> 23:35.276
Don't tell me what I wanna hear.

23:36.379 --> 23:37.612
Tell me what's true.

23:55.265 --> 23:57.265
Come on, Mariana! Get in there!

23:57.300 --> 24:00.134
A jammer has to hit her
way through the blockers.

24:00.170 --> 24:02.537
Okay. I'm sorry.

24:02.572 --> 24:04.539
I just... I... I don't
think I'm tough enough.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.341
Don't do that to yourself.

24:06.376 --> 24:08.242
Get back out there.

24:08.278 --> 24:10.311
Don't let her make you do
something you're not ready for.

24:10.347 --> 24:12.347
No. I got this.

24:26.229 --> 24:27.295
You okay?

24:27.330 --> 24:28.529
Okay?

24:28.565 --> 24:29.597
Yeah.

24:35.472 --> 24:36.571
Let's do this.

24:50.387 --> 24:52.420
Now, that's jammer material!

24:52.455 --> 24:54.455
Good job, Mariana!

24:54.491 --> 24:56.290
And on that note, I'm calling it.

24:56.326 --> 24:57.458
Nice work today, ladies.

25:01.331 --> 25:03.231
That was a dirty hit.
What the hell was that for?

25:03.266 --> 25:05.566
What? I was just trying to get
Mariana mad so she'd hit harder.

25:05.602 --> 25:07.368
Well, that's not your call to make.

25:07.404 --> 25:09.137
She could've gotten hurt.

25:09.172 --> 25:10.538
You ever do something like that again,

25:10.573 --> 25:12.140
you're off the team.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.181
Thanks for helping out with this.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.415
- Yep!
- I would ask Gabe,

25:18.451 --> 25:20.617
but he's in Escondido
for a few days on a job.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.286
How is that having him living here?

25:22.321 --> 25:25.189
It's not ideal, but...

25:25.224 --> 25:26.423
it's important to Jesus.

25:26.459 --> 25:29.359
Yeah, Brandon said something
about it being tense with Jesus.

25:29.395 --> 25:33.163
Yeah. He's, uh, he's been
taking out a lot on him,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.265
but, uh, Brandon's being very patient.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.433
It's just...

25:36.469 --> 25:39.336
I don't want him to feel
like he has to move out

25:39.371 --> 25:41.405
every time things get
tense here at home.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.307
I don't think he's moving out,

25:43.342 --> 25:45.275
I think he just...

25:45.311 --> 25:47.444
needs to take a few days.
He'll be back soon enough.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.279
Things aren't too cramped at your place?

25:49.315 --> 25:50.380
You got a full house over there.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.648
Oh, you know.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.384
I've got Ana's apartment down
the hall if I need to get away.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.421
That almost living
together. Things going well?

25:57.456 --> 26:00.190
Uh... yeah.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.593
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I, um...

26:04.330 --> 26:06.130
I bought her an engagement ring.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.232
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.501
I'm, uh... I'm proposing tonight.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.172
Good! Think she's, uh...

26:15.207 --> 26:16.373
think she's ready for that?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.242
What makes you say that?

26:18.277 --> 26:19.576
Well, she's...

26:19.612 --> 26:22.479
not officially living
with you. I... I just...

26:22.515 --> 26:25.482
seems a little soon is all.

26:25.518 --> 26:27.151
You guys talked about marriage?

26:27.186 --> 26:28.218
No, but I mean...

26:28.254 --> 26:31.255
Well, how do you know she
even wants to get married?

26:35.327 --> 26:36.426
I mean...

26:36.462 --> 26:40.230
she did say something last
night at dinner about...

26:40.266 --> 26:42.366
all women not wanting
a commitment, but...

26:43.502 --> 26:47.337
Man, I don't want to propose
if she's gonna say no.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.539
Just give her some time.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.340
Trust me, you're gonna
know when she is ready.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.209
Women are excellent at dropping hints.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.448
You're so strong.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.252
Such a...

27:02.288 --> 27:04.388
- hot man.
- Mm, yeah?

27:04.423 --> 27:09.326
Yeah, and I love your
stubble. You look so handsome.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.594
Mmm, thanks.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.597
Mmm, when you hold me...

27:13.632 --> 27:16.266
- it's so...
- Okay, um.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.135
Why are you being so weird?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.604
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

27:20.639 --> 27:25.242
Uh, it's just you've never
been quite this chatty before.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.614
I thought you would like it.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.383
Why?

27:33.419 --> 27:34.551
I don't know.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.486
Guys are into that kinda thing, right?

27:38.257 --> 27:39.356
Not this guy.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.260
Um...

27:43.295 --> 27:45.395
I talked to Cole,

27:45.431 --> 27:47.531
- and he said...
- Wait.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.233
You talked to Cole about us?

27:49.268 --> 27:50.500
Well, about sex.

27:50.536 --> 27:53.170
Um, and he said that,

27:53.205 --> 27:55.505
he really likes it when his partner

27:55.541 --> 27:58.208
tells him how masculine he is.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.509
Why are you talking to Cole about this?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.378
Well, who else am I supposed to talk to?

28:01.413 --> 28:03.580
I'm not allowed to talk
to anybody about it.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.550
I... I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.152
Well, why not talk to me, Callie?

28:09.188 --> 28:11.221
My God, why do you have to
make things so complicated?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.323
Okay, fine. You don't
want to have sex, whatever.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.325
Well, who said I wanted to have sex?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.361
Well, isn't that why
you invited me over?

28:17.396 --> 28:20.330
Uh, no, I invited you
here so we could be alone.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.333
Look, no offense, I'm...

28:23.369 --> 28:26.303
I'm just not ready for us to...

28:26.338 --> 28:27.404
Why? Cause of me?

28:27.439 --> 28:30.407
No, because sex is just, like...

28:30.442 --> 28:32.309
a really vulnerable thing for me,

28:32.344 --> 28:34.444
and I need to know that I can trust you.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.512
You don't trust me?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.414
No, that's not what I mean.

28:37.449 --> 28:38.482
It's just...

28:38.517 --> 28:40.150
AJ broke up with you, you know.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.186
I... I just need to make sure that
this isn't, like, a rebound thing.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.222
You know, I'm really sick of boys

28:45.257 --> 28:46.456
telling me how I feel

28:46.492 --> 28:49.259
and... and how complicated I am.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.161
I'm not the only one who
complicates things, okay?

28:51.196 --> 28:52.296
Callie, come on.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.164
I actually can't do
this. I gotta go, so.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.344
We're gonna play a new game
called "The Change Machine."

28:59.379 --> 29:00.445
You turn into a different animal

29:00.480 --> 29:02.247
every single time you go inside.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.315
Yeah. See?

29:11.224 --> 29:13.191
- Now Brandon!
- Yeah.

29:13.226 --> 29:15.193
Uh... o... okay.

29:15.228 --> 29:16.361
Yeah.

29:16.396 --> 29:18.129
Alright.

29:18.165 --> 29:19.431
- Ready?
- Here we go.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.435
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.337
You can do better than that.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.505
I know. Yeah, exactly, come on.

29:27.541 --> 29:30.208
Come on! A little effort for Mason!

29:30.243 --> 29:33.144
Okay, okay.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.279
One more time.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.380
What is he gonna do?

29:41.655 --> 29:43.221
Look, look!

29:43.256 --> 29:44.322
Yeah, go chase him, come on!

29:49.363 --> 29:51.196
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh...

29:52.532 --> 29:54.432
Hey, Mom.

29:54.468 --> 29:56.201
Uh...

29:56.236 --> 29:58.303
you remember Grace, right?

29:58.338 --> 30:00.271
I do, indeed. Hey, Mason.

30:00.307 --> 30:02.173
- Hi.
- How are you, buddy?

30:02.209 --> 30:03.308
Cortney here?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.210
Uh, no, no. I'm just, uh...
I'm babysitting for today.

30:05.245 --> 30:06.544
Oh. Well, that's nice of you.

30:10.217 --> 30:11.316
Cortney is Mason's mom?

30:12.419 --> 30:13.438
Yeah.

30:15.322 --> 30:17.522
When are you gonna move
back with Mommy and me?

30:24.634 --> 30:28.369
Hey, um, is it okay if I
leave my skates and stuff here?

30:28.405 --> 30:30.438
It's just easier not
to lug it all around.

30:30.474 --> 30:31.739
Yeah, sure.

30:31.775 --> 30:33.608
Great job today. Proud of you.

30:39.516 --> 30:42.350
So, we still on for the movies tomorrow?

30:42.385 --> 30:45.286
Oh, uh, actually, I forgot.

30:45.322 --> 30:48.656
I made plans with Lisa and
some of the other girls.

30:48.692 --> 30:50.658
Oh. Okay.

30:53.663 --> 30:55.563
Do you wanna join us?

30:57.601 --> 30:59.334
Sure.

30:59.369 --> 31:00.502
That sounds cool.

31:05.575 --> 31:09.310
Okay. He is asleep, finally.

31:10.614 --> 31:14.549
So, your moms wouldn't let you
spend a couple nights with me,

31:14.584 --> 31:17.519
but they let you live with your
last girlfriend and her toddler?

31:18.622 --> 31:21.623
Uh, well, they didn't
let me live with her.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.260
But, uh...

31:25.295 --> 31:26.427
you are right.

31:26.463 --> 31:30.398
They didn't exactly say I...
I couldn't stay with you.

31:30.433 --> 31:31.566
It's just...

31:31.601 --> 31:33.368
I don't know. I guess I'm... I'm...

31:33.403 --> 31:36.538
I got in my head that maybe we're
moving a little too fast, or...

31:37.674 --> 31:39.507
I mean, for the record,

31:39.543 --> 31:41.476
Coachella was your idea.

31:41.511 --> 31:44.279
Yeah, I know. I...

31:44.314 --> 31:46.481
I just... I obviously...

31:46.516 --> 31:50.385
got in over my head with Cortney, and...

31:51.688 --> 31:53.321
I don't know. I...

31:53.356 --> 31:56.224
I guess I can sometimes be...

31:56.259 --> 31:57.458
a bit of a caretaker.

31:57.494 --> 31:59.594
I don't need you to take care of me.

31:59.629 --> 32:01.429
I know.

32:01.464 --> 32:04.232
You're super independent,
and I love that.

32:05.669 --> 32:08.269
I just... I don't want to make
the same mistakes with you.

32:08.305 --> 32:09.404
You know?

32:10.507 --> 32:12.574
And it'd be really easy, too,

32:12.609 --> 32:15.376
'cause... I really like you.

32:17.681 --> 32:19.447
I really like you, too.

32:22.719 --> 32:25.386
Let's just...

32:25.422 --> 32:27.589
play this whole Coachella thing by ear.

32:27.624 --> 32:29.657
Okay?

32:29.693 --> 32:31.259
Okay.

32:34.497 --> 32:35.663
She's down.

32:35.699 --> 32:37.632
I doubt she'll wake
up before we get home.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.634
Good.

32:39.669 --> 32:41.436
You two have a great time.

32:41.471 --> 32:42.737
Stay out as long as you want.

32:44.574 --> 32:46.641
Thanks, Dad. We won't be too late.

32:50.547 --> 32:51.579
Hey!

32:51.615 --> 32:54.382
Uh, AJ, someone here to see you.

32:59.623 --> 33:01.322
Uh, do you have a minute?

33:02.559 --> 33:03.578
Yeah.

33:10.343 --> 33:12.577
So, what's up?

33:12.612 --> 33:15.380
It's not my fault
that you cheated on me.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.549
Okay. I never said it was.

33:18.585 --> 33:20.385
Maybe you didn't say it,

33:20.420 --> 33:22.420
but you made it seem like it was.

33:22.455 --> 33:24.255
How?

33:24.291 --> 33:26.724
By saying how hard everything was,

33:26.760 --> 33:28.526
how I make everything hard,

33:28.561 --> 33:30.695
like that's some kind of
excuse for what you did.

33:34.334 --> 33:36.467
Why are you doing this?

33:36.503 --> 33:39.437
Callie, why are you over
here rehashing all of this?

33:39.472 --> 33:40.672
'Cause I needed to say it.

33:45.345 --> 33:48.446
And I need this... to be
over. I need it to be done.

33:48.481 --> 33:50.648
It was. It is.

33:54.688 --> 33:56.454
I'm seeing Aaron.

33:56.489 --> 33:59.257
Of course you are.
Should've seen that coming.

33:59.292 --> 34:02.327
I just want things
between us to be clean.

34:02.362 --> 34:05.363
So you... you want to make sure
that I take the blame for cheating

34:05.398 --> 34:06.698
when you were cheating all along?

34:06.733 --> 34:08.533
- I was not...
- You were always into him.

34:08.568 --> 34:11.402
From the first day you met him, right?

34:11.438 --> 34:13.371
Kissing on the beach?

34:13.406 --> 34:15.373
You want things to be
clean with us, fine.

34:15.408 --> 34:17.275
This was a two-way street.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.443
We both made it hard,

34:18.478 --> 34:20.511
and we both made it end.

34:20.547 --> 34:21.646
There.

34:21.681 --> 34:22.714
That clean enough for you?

34:30.357 --> 34:31.723
Yo, B, you got a second?

34:40.433 --> 34:42.433
- What are you doing?
- I'm, uh...

34:43.570 --> 34:46.371
I'm... I'm gonna go stay with
my dad for a little while.

34:46.406 --> 34:48.272
Wait. Is that because of me?

34:50.476 --> 34:51.641
Don't do that, please.

34:51.678 --> 34:54.679
Yeah, I... I'm sorry that I keep
taking everything out on you.

34:54.714 --> 34:57.482
Look, I have been really, really angry,

34:57.517 --> 35:00.485
because I'm... I'm afraid that
I'm never gonna be the same again.

35:05.358 --> 35:06.424
You're not.

35:12.699 --> 35:15.700
When, uh, my hand got smashed,

35:15.735 --> 35:18.403
I thought my life was completely over.

35:18.438 --> 35:19.670
You know, everything I worked for.

35:19.706 --> 35:22.540
I... I mean, I thought
I'd never play piano again.

35:22.575 --> 35:24.575
Yeah, but you did.

35:24.611 --> 35:25.710
Yeah, I did.

35:25.745 --> 35:28.312
But you know, I had to learn
how to play differently.

35:29.649 --> 35:32.450
Took a lot of hard work,
you know, and a lot of time.

35:33.486 --> 35:35.553
But if you're patient...

35:36.689 --> 35:38.589
you can come back from this.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.560
Just because things won't be the same

35:42.595 --> 35:43.694
doesn't mean they won't be okay.

35:45.632 --> 35:48.399
Now I just gotta convince Emma of that.

35:50.370 --> 35:51.389
Hey.

35:56.376 --> 35:58.476
- It's okay.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

36:09.622 --> 36:11.456
This isn't a rebound thing.

36:17.664 --> 36:22.433
And you were right, and
I am over AJ, but, um...

36:22.469 --> 36:25.703
I'm not over the fact
that he really hurt me.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.642
Which is...

36:31.678 --> 36:35.513
why I'm not ready for
us to have sex either.

36:36.616 --> 36:39.350
But you were going to anyway?

36:39.385 --> 36:42.386
I don't know, I guess, yeah.

36:42.422 --> 36:44.522
Why?

36:44.557 --> 36:46.324
'Cause I was worried that

36:46.359 --> 36:48.526
if I told you I wasn't ready, that...

36:48.561 --> 36:51.295
you would think it's cause you're trans,

36:51.331 --> 36:52.630
- and it's not.
- Okay, I...

36:52.665 --> 36:55.399
I don't think that. I won't think that.

36:57.637 --> 36:59.470
And, um...

37:00.707 --> 37:03.274
when we are ready,

37:03.309 --> 37:04.542
like both of us, um...

37:05.645 --> 37:08.613
I'm gonna need to ask you some stuff

37:08.648 --> 37:12.583
without... you know, being
afraid I'm saying the wrong thing,

37:12.619 --> 37:14.352
which I'm probably gonna...

37:14.387 --> 37:18.289
Okay, hey, hey. There's
nothing you can't ask me.

37:18.324 --> 37:19.457
Nothing.

37:19.492 --> 37:23.327
Just... please ask me.

37:23.363 --> 37:24.462
And not someone else.

37:26.266 --> 37:27.598
I need to be able to trust you, too.

37:29.435 --> 37:30.454
Deal?

37:31.538 --> 37:32.703
Deal.

37:50.587 --> 37:54.185
_

37:55.986 --> 37:56.986
_

37:57.397 --> 37:59.597
Hey. Do you guys need
some clean towels in here?

38:02.302 --> 38:04.402
Oh my God! What happened to you?

38:04.437 --> 38:05.570
What?

38:05.605 --> 38:08.239
Oh, uh, nothing, I...

38:08.274 --> 38:10.641
I... I mean, I fell at school.

38:10.677 --> 38:12.310
I didn't even know that was there.

38:12.345 --> 38:14.312
Honey, you gotta be more careful.

38:15.415 --> 38:17.315
Let me get you some arnica for that.

38:23.556 --> 38:25.389
Thank you so much.

38:25.425 --> 38:27.291
You're a total lifesaver.

38:27.327 --> 38:30.261
Yeah, no, it's no problem, really.

38:30.296 --> 38:31.696
So you... you got
everything moved in then?

38:31.731 --> 38:33.431
Where's your new place?

38:33.466 --> 38:36.300
I got that great apartment
off Monroe Street,

38:36.336 --> 38:38.336
but I can't move in for a week.

38:38.371 --> 38:40.671
Oh, so, where are you staying?

38:40.707 --> 38:42.673
Uh, I'm just gonna get a motel room

38:42.709 --> 38:44.575
for tonight, and then, um...

38:44.611 --> 38:47.678
hopefully couch surf with some
friends till the apartment's ready.

38:47.714 --> 38:50.314
What... do you have money for a motel?

38:52.452 --> 38:54.285
So, we've been looking
into what it would take

38:54.320 --> 38:55.653
to get you back to school.

38:56.689 --> 38:58.255
And?

38:58.291 --> 39:00.424
And, well, there are a couple things.

39:00.460 --> 39:03.327
First, you'll need to
get, uh, an assessment

39:03.363 --> 39:05.329
to see where... where your learning is,

39:05.365 --> 39:07.665
how you're retaining
information, and all that.

39:07.700 --> 39:09.266
Okay.

39:09.302 --> 39:10.468
Okay.

39:10.503 --> 39:12.370
And then, once we know
exactly where you are,

39:12.405 --> 39:14.472
you will probably get a...

39:14.507 --> 39:17.241
- uh... right.
- A paraprofessional.

39:17.276 --> 39:18.676
What... what is that?

39:18.711 --> 39:21.212
It's, uh, an educational aide

39:21.247 --> 39:22.546
who will go with you to your classes.

39:22.582 --> 39:25.383
Wait, is that like
a... like a babysitter?

39:25.418 --> 39:26.437
No.

39:26.452 --> 39:28.352
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on!

39:28.388 --> 39:30.254
No! Abso... abso-freaking-lutely not!

39:30.289 --> 39:31.455
- Come on.
- Jesus, listen.

39:31.491 --> 39:33.357
If you would like to go back to school,

39:33.393 --> 39:34.659
you really have no other choice.

39:34.694 --> 39:36.260
Okay!

39:36.295 --> 39:38.396
Okay, well, then... then
I won't go back to school.

39:38.431 --> 39:39.463
- No.
- No, wait, look.

39:39.499 --> 39:41.332
We know that things are
never gonna be the same.

39:41.367 --> 39:43.234
So I can get my GED,

39:43.269 --> 39:45.336
and... and I can... I can
work construction with Gabe.

39:45.371 --> 39:47.304
No! That is not an option.

39:47.340 --> 39:48.673
That is an option! I am 16.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.441
I can drop out. It's my life.

39:50.476 --> 39:51.495
Jesus, no!

39:51.511 --> 39:54.445
Jesus!

40:00.586 --> 40:02.553
Hey.

40:02.588 --> 40:04.355
Hey.

40:04.390 --> 40:05.623
How was dinner?

40:05.658 --> 40:07.658
Uh, it was fine.

40:07.694 --> 40:09.660
It was kind of a disappointment.

40:09.696 --> 40:12.396
I mean, I did get this.

40:13.766 --> 40:16.634
What? Oh my God!

40:16.669 --> 40:17.702
What?

40:17.737 --> 40:20.271
You guys are getting married?

40:22.308 --> 40:23.474
I had no idea.

40:23.509 --> 40:24.675
What? Why's he laughing?

40:24.711 --> 40:26.410
I told him everything.

40:26.446 --> 40:28.279
Are you...

40:28.314 --> 40:30.347
Sorry, we had to mess with you.

40:30.383 --> 40:31.682
Ha-ha. Very funny.

40:31.718 --> 40:33.517
Jerks.

40:33.553 --> 40:35.419
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:35.455 --> 40:36.754
One little happy family.

40:36.789 --> 40:38.589
Yeah.

40:38.624 --> 40:43.360
So... Gabe won't be back for a few days,

40:43.396 --> 40:45.362
and so you're welcome
to stay here until then.

40:46.499 --> 40:49.300
Brandon, are you sure your
mom's are okay with this?

40:49.335 --> 40:50.601
You've already done so much for us.

40:50.636 --> 40:51.655
No, we're happy to help.

40:51.671 --> 40:53.738
Seriously it's... no worries.

41:04.417 --> 41:05.683
Whoa, wait, whoa, Mason!

41:05.718 --> 41:07.685
That... that's super dangerous,
bud. Thank you very much.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.553
Thank you. Why don't you run over there?

41:13.593 --> 41:15.493
Mason!

41:15.528 --> 41:16.727
- Hey, where did you go?
- Alright, Mason.
