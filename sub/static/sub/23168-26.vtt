00:02.236 --> 00:03.569
to this guy named Brian
on Snapchat.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.170
It's crazy, he goes
to the same school,

00:05.239 --> 00:06.638
and they've never come across
each other.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.073
- I tried to meet up with him
at the rec.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.975
He wasn't there.
- Or he was there,

00:10.044 --> 00:11.710
but you weren't looking
for the right guy.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.525
I'm gonna be like,
"Big red flag."

00:59.593 --> 01:01.493
- Do we not cut the the bull-
[bleep] adequately as is, or--

01:01.562 --> 01:03.996
- I mean, maybe you just
can't see it the way--

01:04.065 --> 01:05.397
- You need--all right, good,
I love it.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.999
It's been six years I've been
doing this,

01:07.068 --> 01:10.035
so maybe my bull-[bleep]-ometer
is not as sharp

01:10.104 --> 01:11.570
and finely-tuned
as it once was.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.138

- Cut--all right.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.509

<i> - Hey, cool.</i>
<i> - So, first of all,</i>

02:58.379 --> 02:59.978
how'd you end up
at Blinn College?

03:00.047 --> 03:02.848
<i> - I had a basketball coach</i>
<i> who got me a scholarship</i>

management scholarship?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.553
<i> - Yes, sir.</i>
- That's awesome.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.254

03:09.323 --> 03:10.956
about Aubri a little bit...
<i> - Okay.</i>

03:11.025 --> 03:12.758
- And--and how this whole
situation came to be.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.028
<i> - Aubri had told me</i>
<i> that a fine dude</i>

03:16.096 --> 03:17.563
<i> had hit her up on Snapchat,</i>

03:17.631 --> 03:19.598
<i> and it said that</i>
<i> he added her by username.</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:21.700
<i> But on her social medias,</i>

03:21.769 --> 03:23.902
<i> I don't think she has</i>
<i> her Snapchat name on there.</i>

03:23.971 --> 03:25.470
<i> So, like, somebody probably</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:27.406
<i> gave it to him,</i>
<i> or something like that.</i>

03:27.474 --> 03:28.740
- And so he hit her up
on Snapchat.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.542
Does that mean he was
sending her pictures?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.711
<i> - Not selfies.</i>
<i> Like, they were Snapchatting,</i>

03:32.780 --> 03:34.780
<i> like, the text message</i>
<i> on Snapchat.</i>

03:34.848 --> 03:36.648
- Right, but how did she know
what he looked like?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.651
<i> - He posts his pictures</i>
<i> on his story.</i>

03:39.720 --> 03:42.221
- Doesn't he go
to the same school as you guys?

03:42.289 --> 03:43.522
<i> - Yes.</i>
- Wouldn't--wouldn't you expect

03:43.591 --> 03:45.357
to, like, see him around?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.861
- Right, so what's his excuse
for never being on campus?

03:49.930 --> 03:52.397
<i> - He's always going home</i>
<i> on the weekends,</i>

03:52.466 --> 03:54.233
<i> or he's busy with homework.</i>

03:54.301 --> 03:55.867
<i> And, like, she's very sweet,</i>

03:55.936 --> 03:57.936

<i> be understanding with him.</i>

03:59.406 --> 04:01.173
<i> but, like, you make time</i>
<i> if you want to.</i>

04:01.242 --> 04:04.042
- Yeah.
- Right.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.877
- Brian seems suss.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.446
- And Aubri and--and Brian

04:07.514 --> 04:09.248
haven't talked on the phone,
right?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.216
<i> - No.</i>
- Does she even have his number

04:11.285 --> 04:13.118
or are they just only Snapchat?

04:13.187 --> 04:14.653
<i> - Only has his Snapchat.</i>

04:14.722 --> 04:15.621
- Wow.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.789
- What do you think
Aubri will say

04:17.858 --> 04:20.225
when she finds out that you
reached out to us?

04:20.294 --> 04:21.793
<i> - I feel like</i>
<i> she'll be on board.</i>

04:21.862 --> 04:23.695
<i> Like, especially</i>
<i> if it's, like, meeting him.</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:26.331

is what's stringing her along.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.799
<i> - Yeah.</i>

04:27.868 --> 04:29.668

What's your instinct tell you?

04:38.879 --> 04:41.213
What's your BS-ometer telling
you right now off the bat?

04:41.282 --> 04:43.715
- I'm thinking...

04:43.784 --> 04:46.718
that Brian is, like,
a real creep or, like--

04:46.787 --> 04:49.655
- Well, the creepiest thing
is that he added her

04:49.723 --> 04:50.889
by her username.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.291
- Yeah, and he knows her.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.092
Or, like, a girl that knows her

04:54.161 --> 04:56.728
is, like, jealous of her
and wants to waste her time.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.729
Mm-hmm.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.809
- Yes.
- All right, good to meet you.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.245
- It is so nice meeting y'all.
- See ya.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.746
Wow.
- Oh, this is tight.

06:54.815 --> 06:58.316
This is cozy.
- Have a seat.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.519
- Janisa gave us
a little backstory

07:00.587 --> 07:02.387
but fill us in a bit more,

07:02.456 --> 07:04.222
how you kind of ended up
in this relationship.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.724
- So, like, when he actually--

07:05.793 --> 07:07.559
I guess you could say
shot his shot, um...

07:07.628 --> 07:10.362
- [soft laugh]
- He slid up on my Snapchat.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.598
I had posted a picture and he
just sent me some heart eyes.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.000
- So he responded
to your story.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.469
- Yes, and then we've been
talking since.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.837
- How did it, like,
get to the level where

07:18.906 --> 07:20.405
you were like,
"Oh, this guy's cool."

07:20.474 --> 07:21.940
- When I was in
the relationship with my ex,

07:22.009 --> 07:23.575
like, I broke up with him
'cause he cheated on me,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.310
and I told Brian that.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.480
And he we just kind of clicked
because he was a good listener

07:28.549 --> 07:29.848
<i> and he had a good heart.</i>

07:29.917 --> 07:31.583
<i> And he was willing</i>
<i> to actually want</i>

07:31.652 --> 07:33.118
<i> to be there for me.</i>

07:33.187 --> 07:34.920
And then, like, I just started
to get to know him

07:34.988 --> 07:37.022
a little bit more, and I
like his personality and stuff.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.490
- Mm-hmm.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.625
- But how'd this Brian guy
get your Snapchat?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.727
How did he know--
- I don't even know,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.863
because whenever he added me,
it said "by username."

07:44.932 --> 07:46.865
So he obviously had to have
my username.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.901
- Did you ever ask him
how he got your Snapchat?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.536
- No.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.705
And, like, it's just
kind of weird, because

07:53.774 --> 07:55.240
<i> the reason why we can't</i>
<i> get on the phone is because</i>

07:55.309 --> 07:57.242
<i> he said he doesn't</i>
<i> have any minutes,</i>

07:57.311 --> 07:58.677
<i> and then we can't FaceTime</i>

07:58.745 --> 08:00.679
<i> because he doesn't have</i>
<i> any Wi-Fi.</i>

08:00.747 --> 08:03.415
And then we can't meet up
because he's always

08:03.484 --> 08:05.217
leaving to go home.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.585
He lives in Houston.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.487
- How's he getting to Houston?
- His car.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.689
- You got gas money
but you ain't got minute money?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.157
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

08:12.226 --> 08:13.892
Yeah. This is weird.
- I mean, I don't know.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.293
- Something's up.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.729
- He's posting--he's putting up
stories on Snapchat?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.898
- Post stories and stuff, yeah.
Like, pictures.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.566
- And they're, like, selfies?
- Yeah.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.602
- Or mirror pics, or whatever?
- You wanna see?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.036
- Yeah.
- I wanna see.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.605

or you just have some saved?

08:26.673 --> 08:27.772
- Oh, no, I have some saved.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.508

08:34.915 --> 08:36.548

screenshotted this?

08:36.617 --> 08:38.216
- Mm-hmm.
- From his story.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.951

08:41.588 --> 08:43.788

08:46.260 --> 08:47.859
he's got Wi-Fi or minutes.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.328
I mean, how's he gonna tell you
he can't use his phone

08:50.397 --> 08:51.496
when he's clearly using it?

08:51.565 --> 08:52.998
- He just makes up excuses.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.800
Every time I try to say,
"Okay, like, let's meet up,"

08:55.869 --> 08:57.335
he always has something.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.037
<i> Just yesterday I tried</i>
<i> to meet up with him</i>

08:59.106 --> 09:00.839

09:02.609 --> 09:04.075

- Yeah, the recreation--

09:04.144 --> 09:05.610
- Rec center, got it.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.713
So I went over there
and he wasn't there.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.115
- And did you message him
and be like, "I'm here"?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.550
<i> - Mm-hmm.</i>
<i> - And what happened?</i>

09:11.618 --> 09:13.084
- He didn't reply.
- Weird.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.719
- Yeah.
- Was there anyone else there

09:14.788 --> 09:16.655
that looked
kind of, like, weird?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.056

09:18.125 --> 09:19.391
- No, just normal people

09:19.459 --> 09:21.026

playing basketball.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.427
- Of course,
it's always possible

09:22.496 --> 09:23.995
that he was there...
- Mm-hmm.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.498
- But you weren't looking
for the right guy.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.732
- Yeah, that's
what I'm thinking.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.900
- Weird.
[laughs]

09:28.969 --> 09:30.769
- What do you know
about this guy?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.737
- I know that he says

09:32.806 --> 09:35.407
that he stays in Wheeler,
which is, um,

09:35.475 --> 09:36.808
like, a dormitory here.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.877
- That at least
shows us that, like,

09:38.946 --> 09:40.745
whoever you're talking to is

09:40.814 --> 09:42.047
in the area, right?
- Yeah.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.515

about the rec center,

09:43.584 --> 09:44.916
he knows about
Wheeler dormitory.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.217

10:23.490 --> 10:24.856

- "Hustle."

10:32.132 --> 10:34.733
Mm... no.

All right, so if he uses
"bj-hustle" on Snapchat,

10:37.004 --> 10:38.703

anywhere else.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.972

his name, maybe?
