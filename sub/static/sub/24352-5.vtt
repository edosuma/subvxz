Penn and Teller,
don't look now,

01:32.480 --> 01:34.079
- My name is Emily Victoria.

01:34.079 --> 01:36.049
I am from Gainesville, Florida,

01:36.049 --> 01:37.880
<i>and I'm a psychology student.</i>

01:37.880 --> 01:39.300

<i>I love everything

<i>and I try to get
as much as I can out of them.</i>

01:43.519 --> 01:45.850
<i>I was inspired by "Fool Us"</i>

01:45.850 --> 01:48.350

<i>After I performed it, they
thought it was really good.</i>

01:50.380 --> 01:52.480
They suggested
that I submit it to "Fool Us."

01:52.480 --> 01:54.950
<i>I picked mentalism
for a couple of reasons.</i>

01:54.950 --> 01:58.079
One, it's because my hands
are way too tiny to palm cards.

And two, I figured,
"I'm a psychology major.

02:00.279 --> 02:02.519

02:02.519 --> 02:04.320

Oh, well, if I do,

[cheering and applause]

02:29.820 --> 02:31.320
- Good evening, everyone.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.279
My name is Emily Victoria,
and I am so excited to be here.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.720
My journey as a magician
only began about a year ago,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.380
when I decided to enroll
in this class called,

02:38.380 --> 02:40.220
"The Psychology of Creativity."

02:40.220 --> 02:42.850
Now, in this class,
our final grade was determined

02:42.850 --> 02:44.250
by a creative project
that we worked on

02:44.250 --> 02:45.980
throughout the entire semester,

02:45.980 --> 02:48.950
and being a huge fan of magic,
and of "Fool Us",

02:48.950 --> 02:50.419
I decided to create
my own magic trick

02:50.419 --> 02:51.649
to fool my class.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.620
But I was obviously
completely new to magic,

02:54.620 --> 02:56.279
so I needed to work on concepts

02:56.279 --> 02:58.279
that I was
already familiar with.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.549
So I used my knowledge
of human psychology,

03:00.549 --> 03:02.280
about how you can
use body language

03:02.280 --> 03:04.519
and facial tells,
like microexpressions,

03:04.519 --> 03:06.320
to figure out what someone
is thinking about

03:06.320 --> 03:07.880
without them saying a word.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.019
The second thing I used

03:09.019 --> 03:11.419
is something
I always have with me--

03:11.419 --> 03:12.649
my phone.

03:12.649 --> 03:15.179
And the third thing is,
well, a volunteer.

03:15.179 --> 03:17.450
So, Alyson,
if you'll join me on stage.

03:17.450 --> 03:20.880
Everyone please give a big
round of applause for Alyson.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.320
- Hi.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.779
- All right, Alyson.

03:23.779 --> 03:25.880
So on my phone,
I have something

03:25.880 --> 03:28.320
very precious to me:
my music library.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.480
And for tonight, I went ahead
and made a playlist

03:30.480 --> 03:33.620
of over 1,500 songs
that you can pick from.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.720
You could pick a song
from the 1950s,

03:35.720 --> 03:36.750
you can pick a song
from last year.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.750
I don't care.
- Wow.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.380
- I only care
is that you know it,

03:39.380 --> 03:40.519
and the more you like it,

03:40.519 --> 03:41.620
the better
this is going to work.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.250
- Oh, okay.
- So go ahead

03:43.250 --> 03:44.419
and put the earphones in.

03:44.419 --> 03:45.779
When you find one
that you like--

03:45.779 --> 03:47.279
I'm gonna give you
plenty of time to pick,

03:47.279 --> 03:48.549
I have to talk to the audience
a little bit.

03:48.549 --> 03:49.620
- Okay, yeah, please do.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.350
- [laughs]
I have a bit of a confession.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.549
See, before coming
on here tonight,

03:54.549 --> 03:57.120
I cheated, um, a lot.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.649
[laughs]
I went ahead and decided

04:00.649 --> 04:02.019
who I was going to work with

04:02.019 --> 04:04.280
instead of just picking someone
at random,

04:04.280 --> 04:06.880
which isn't normally
a luxury that I have.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.450
It's also not a luxury that
they have hours and hours

04:09.450 --> 04:11.419
of video footage
that I can analyze,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.579
so I re-watched "Buffy"...
[laughter]

04:13.579 --> 04:16.649
I re-watched--
oh, um, "American Pie,"

04:16.649 --> 04:18.320
"American Reunion,"
"American Wedding"--

04:18.320 --> 04:19.478
probably didn't need
to watch those.

04:19.478 --> 04:21.120
[laughter]
Oh, "How I Met Your Mother."

04:21.120 --> 04:22.779
Every single, you know,
YouTube video

04:22.779 --> 04:25.380
that I could find of Alyson,
I went ahead and analyzed

04:25.380 --> 04:26.950
so that I could find
her facial tics,

04:26.950 --> 04:28.380
her patterns of behavior...
[laughter]

04:28.380 --> 04:30.820
So, Alyson, do you have a song?
- Mm-hmm.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.519
Am I supposed to be playing it?
- Yeah.

04:32.519 --> 04:33.920
- Oh, good.
- Great.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.620
So, would you like
to change it?

04:35.620 --> 04:37.380
- No.
- Okay.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.979
So...

04:38.979 --> 04:40.779
Can you do me a favor
and count to ten?

04:40.779 --> 04:44.050
- One, two, three...
- Are you nervous?

04:44.050 --> 04:46.920
- Yes.
Four, five six,

04:46.920 --> 04:49.079
seven, eight--
- All right, that's good.

04:49.079 --> 04:51.120
- Um, can you go ahead
and pick a color?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.680
- Pink.
- Okay, that's interesting.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.279
It's a very vibrant,
very vivacious color,

04:56.279 --> 04:58.120
right, so it's probably
an upbeat song

04:58.120 --> 04:59.779
that you're thinking of, right?
- Mm.

04:59.779 --> 05:01.979
- Um, never ever lie
to the cops, Alyson,

05:01.979 --> 05:03.219
'cause they can read you
like a book.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.519
- No, I'm a terrible liar.

05:04.519 --> 05:05.820
- Um, so let me think.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.349
Can you pick a food?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.550
- A food.

05:08.550 --> 05:11.820
A tomato.
- A tomato, that's interesting.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.950
Um, am I right to say
that this is a male artist?

05:13.950 --> 05:15.420
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.950
And am I right to say
that this song is probably

05:17.950 --> 05:20.279
before the year 2000.
- Yes.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.120
- Is this--this artist
isn't alive, are they?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.579
- No.
- Okay.

05:23.579 --> 05:26.349
Um, inside or outside?

05:26.349 --> 05:28.950
- Outside.
- Cold or hot?

05:28.950 --> 05:30.719
- Cold.
- Sweet or salty?

05:30.719 --> 05:33.050
- Sweet.
- Can you say, um,

05:33.050 --> 05:34.380
"L, M, N, O, P" for me?

05:34.380 --> 05:37.420
- L, M, N, O, P.
- And then "A, B, C."

05:37.420 --> 05:40.149
- A, B, C.

05:40.149 --> 05:41.820
- All right, I think I have it,

05:41.820 --> 05:43.979
but I just need you
to count down from ten, now.

05:43.979 --> 05:46.250
- Okay.
Ten, nine, eight,

05:46.250 --> 05:48.649
seven, six, five,

05:48.649 --> 05:50.950
four, three, two, one.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.120
- Awesome.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.719
So--oops.

05:53.719 --> 05:55.550
I think I have the artist.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.149
Is it Michael Jackson?
- Yes.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.750
- And the song?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.779
- "Beat It."

06:00.779 --> 06:03.979
[cheering and applause]

06:03.979 --> 06:05.979

06:05.979 --> 06:08.180

06:10.880 --> 06:12.579

06:12.579 --> 06:15.620
- Ah, thank you so much!
- Thank you.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.279
You were talking
about microexpressions.

06:18.279 --> 06:19.820
- Yes.
- I'm pretty macro.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.779
[both laugh]
- Well, I think that's

06:21.779 --> 06:23.180
what makes you great
for television.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.349
- Well, thank you.
- You're super expressive.

06:24.349 --> 06:25.450
- Thank you.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.880
This is amazing--
So you were inspired

06:27.880 --> 06:30.120
to do a trick
because of this show...

06:30.120 --> 06:31.550
- Yep.
- And now you're on the show.

06:31.550 --> 06:32.880
- Yeah, it's kind of surreal.
- That's really--

06:32.880 --> 06:34.279
I think that's a first.
- Yeah.

06:34.279 --> 06:36.320
Um, when I got the email
saying that

06:36.320 --> 06:37.649
I was supposed to be on it,

06:37.649 --> 06:39.219
I had just
come out from surgery,

06:39.219 --> 06:40.380
so I thought
it was the pain meds.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.620
[laughter]

06:41.620 --> 06:43.079
- That's so cool.
But you're--

06:43.079 --> 06:45.250
you're actually studying
psychology and zoology?

06:45.250 --> 06:46.380
Is that correct?
- Yes, mm-hmm.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.120
So I'm really interested
in animal behavior,

06:48.120 --> 06:49.620
so the origins of behavior...
- Right.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.120
- And everything like that.
- Who do you prefer to study,

06:52.120 --> 06:54.450
animals or people?
- [sighs]

06:54.450 --> 06:57.450
People have better,
like, research methods,

06:57.450 --> 06:59.420
but animals are cuddlier...
- Mm.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.849
- But animals
are also smellier.

07:00.849 --> 07:02.620
- Oh.
[laughter]

07:02.620 --> 07:04.849
All right, um...

07:04.849 --> 07:06.950
I just can't read them.
- Yeah.

07:06.950 --> 07:08.250
- Can you read
their facial tics?

07:08.250 --> 07:09.719
- Not really.

07:09.719 --> 07:11.380
Um, I studied both of them
pretty well.

07:11.380 --> 07:12.680
He kind of looks
a little angry.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.880
- I know, that--
that's a good sign.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.320
[laughter]
That's a good sign.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.180
The angrier they look,
the better it is.

07:18.180 --> 07:19.950
- Yeah.
- Let's go talk to them,

07:19.950 --> 07:21.019
shall we?
- Great.

07:21.019 --> 07:23.180
- All right.
Penn, Teller.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.979
- Oh, um...

07:24.979 --> 07:27.149
Good. That was good.
- Yay.

07:27.149 --> 07:28.550
[laughter]
- That was really good.

07:28.550 --> 07:31.620
And, um, uh...

07:31.620 --> 07:34.820
the problem with mentalism,
uh, which is what this is,

07:34.820 --> 07:36.750
is that there's a lot of ways
to do stuff.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.380
I wanna ask you some things--
I think we got it.

07:39.380 --> 07:41.420
I'm almost sure we got it,
but I wanna ask you

07:41.420 --> 07:42.779
some things that may be...

07:42.779 --> 07:44.349
a little bit intrusive.

07:44.349 --> 07:46.479
Uh, I mean, could we...?

07:46.479 --> 07:48.320
Could we look at your glasses?
- Yeah.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.979
- We can?
[stammers]

07:49.979 --> 07:51.550
We'll come up to you.
- You can look at my glasses,

07:51.550 --> 07:52.779
you can look at my phone.

07:52.779 --> 07:54.219
- Look at your ph-
your glasses--

07:54.219 --> 07:55.550
Okay, well, why don't we go
back up here with Alyson?

07:55.550 --> 07:57.250
[laughter]
'Cause they don't look like...

07:57.250 --> 08:00.420
- Sorry, I'm eager.
- Glasses that are--that are...

08:00.420 --> 08:01.820
that are so--
[stammering]

08:01.820 --> 08:03.519
Can we look in your ears?
Would that be out of line?

[laughter]

08:04.849 --> 08:06.349

08:06.349 --> 08:09.450
- We--we know you're
getting the information...

08:09.450 --> 08:10.849
- Okay.
- But...

08:10.849 --> 08:12.849
It's not your glasses.
- Mm-mm.

08:12.849 --> 08:15.149
- It's not your ears.
Is it the--is it the...

08:15.149 --> 08:16.519
[knocking]

somehow,

20:29.650 --> 20:31.350

20:31.350 --> 20:32.550

20:35.350 --> 20:36.620
Let's find out.

Now, without causing any risk,
injury to myself,

20:38.449 --> 20:42.019
or to any of you,
let's use, uh, playing cards,

20:42.019 --> 20:44.280
because playing cards
have 52 different images.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.120
Which one to choose...?

20:46.120 --> 20:47.350
You know what?
Let's make this simple.

20:47.350 --> 20:48.749
Uh, Penn.
- Yes.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.179
- You can help me select
a card here.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.179

flip through here,

20:51.179 --> 20:52.580

20:52.580 --> 20:54.620
- Stop.
- Stopped me right here.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.919
Now, the idea is that
the mirror is going to absorb

20:57.919 --> 20:59.820

is not going inside the mirror.

29:24.219 --> 29:25.580
Thank you so much!

Thanks so much for being here!
Thanks, Penn and Teller!

[excited hollering]

29:30.750 --> 29:34.379
What?
[laughing]

29:34.379 --> 29:36.320
- And here he is now,

29:36.320 --> 29:38.250
Seth Grabel!

29:38.250 --> 29:41.980
[cheering and applause]

29:41.980 --> 29:43.379
Wow!

29:43.379 --> 29:45.379
Hi!
- Hi, how are you?

29:45.379 --> 29:47.419
- That was exciting.
- Thank you.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.080
- That is definitely not
an easy trick, is it?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.949
- It was crazy.
[both laughing]

29:51.949 --> 29:54.350
- And where did you find
that dinosaur?

29:54.350 --> 29:56.649
- He's--Craigslist, actually.
- Really?

29:56.649 --> 29:57.750
[laughter]

29:57.750 --> 30:00.020
And what's his name?
- Robosaurus.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.850
- Robosaurus.
- Yeah, the one, the only.

30:01.850 --> 30:02.919
- Okay.

30:02.919 --> 30:04.980
Does he only tear apart
police cars?

30:04.980 --> 30:06.320
- No, he can actually
tear apart anything.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.980
- Oh, really?
- Pretty much anything, yeah.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.820
- So what--what else
do you have

30:10.820 --> 30:12.050
working in your mind?

30:12.050 --> 30:15.020
- I just saw something
really cool

30:15.020 --> 30:17.280
with a armored truck.
- Ooh.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.080
- So that's something that
I want to do with a armored truck.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.379
- So what drew you
to big illusions?

30:21.379 --> 30:24.280
- I've done a lot of cards,
I've done a lot of coin stuff.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.020
My thing right now is bigger,
better, stronger,

30:27.020 --> 30:30.119
more dangerous and crazy.
- Cool.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.750
Okay, let's see if they know
how you survived that trick.

30:32.750 --> 30:33.879
- Let's see.
How did I survive that trick?

30:33.879 --> 30:34.949
- All right.

30:34.949 --> 30:37.050
- That was
a wicked big dinosaur.

30:37.050 --> 30:38.850
- Yeah, it was.
- Wicked big!

30:38.850 --> 30:42.320
Wicked--we like that dinosaur.
We want that dinosaur.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.480
- [laughs]
- You know, we see you

30:43.480 --> 30:45.919
go out that on parking lot, we go,
"Oh, boy!

30:45.919 --> 30:47.480
Not another card trick!"

30:47.480 --> 30:48.980
[laughter]
- Thank you.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.919
- That was the farthest
from a card trick

30:50.919 --> 30:52.250
we've had on the show.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.320
- That's what
I was trying to do.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.419
- You were
completely successful.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.619
- Thank you.
- It was fabulous.

30:55.619 --> 30:57.250
And using a police car...

30:57.250 --> 30:58.619
- I was actually
trying to get--

30:58.619 --> 31:00.379
you know, a police car
you can't get out of easily.

31:00.379 --> 31:01.550
- Oh, I see.
- That was the...

31:01.550 --> 31:02.879
- I see.
- That was it.

31:02.879 --> 31:04.449
- I think of a whole
different thing, you know...

31:04.449 --> 31:05.679
- I understand.
[laughter]

31:05.679 --> 31:06.879
- Yeah, but, okay, good,

31:06.879 --> 31:08.419
'cause you're trapped
in a police car,

31:08.419 --> 31:09.949
and you were trapped
in that police car.

31:09.949 --> 31:11.219
- I was actually
a little scared, I was trapped

31:11.219 --> 31:13.649
a little too long.
- Yeah.

31:13.649 --> 31:15.879
But you were trapped
in that police car,

31:15.879 --> 31:19.149
and you followed one
of our major rules of magic,

31:19.149 --> 31:21.080
which is--if you turn around,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.379
what you're gonna see there
is above the name "Fool Us,"

31:24.379 --> 31:27.219
it says "Penn & Teller."

31:27.219 --> 31:29.649
And you cannot find
a shot of us

31:29.649 --> 31:32.649
that does not say
"Penn & Teller" behind it.

31:32.649 --> 31:35.780
And you had your name
and signage all over,

31:35.780 --> 31:38.820
and that may be the most
important part of the trick.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.679
Get your name out there
all the time...

31:40.679 --> 31:42.949
- Thank you.
- That's it.

31:42.949 --> 31:44.850
And you were wonderful.
- Does that mean they know

31:44.850 --> 31:47.149
how you did the trick?
- I learned from the best.

31:47.149 --> 31:48.280
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
- So you know how--
that they know

31:50.280 --> 31:52.480
how you did the trick?
- That's a 100% right.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.080
Yes, good job.
Thank you so much.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.280
- Aww.
- Nicely done.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.080
- You guys got it.
- Thank you.

31:57.080 --> 32:00.020
- Thank you.
- All right, Seth Grabel!

32:00.020 --> 32:01.520
- I loved it.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.449
[cheering and applause]

32:03.449 --> 32:04.980
- We need a moment
to make room

32:04.980 --> 32:06.649
for our next amazing act.

32:06.649 --> 32:10.350
Come back and see more
mind-bending magic after this.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.119
- Penn and Teller love
to find ways

32:25.119 --> 32:28.349
to put their unique stamp
on classic magic tricks.

32:28.349 --> 32:31.919
And here they are,
Penn and Teller!

32:31.919 --> 32:35.649
[cheering and applause]

32:35.649 --> 32:37.050
- We're gonna...

32:37.050 --> 32:39.180
we're gonna bring out a friend
to help us with this.

32:39.180 --> 32:40.819
One of the stars
of "Grey's Anatomy"

32:40.819 --> 32:43.579
and "Designated Survivor,"
our friend Kim Raver.

32:43.579 --> 32:46.579
[cheering and applause]

32:47.720 --> 32:48.720
- Kim!

32:48.720 --> 32:50.849
- Hello!
- Good to see you.

32:50.849 --> 32:52.119
We're gonna do a magic trick
for you, okay?

32:52.119 --> 32:53.220
- I'm so excited.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.720
- And this--
this is an odd one for us

32:54.720 --> 32:56.750
'cause we don't usually
do magic tricks

32:56.750 --> 32:58.079
that other people do,
but this is,

32:58.079 --> 33:00.750
uh, a classic of magic
called "the egg bag."

33:00.750 --> 33:02.419
That's also the prop list.

33:02.419 --> 33:03.919
Use an egg...

33:03.919 --> 33:05.050
and a bag.
[laughter]

33:05.050 --> 33:07.050
We do it differently
from everyone else

33:07.050 --> 33:09.649
because, uh,
we use real magic.

33:09.649 --> 33:12.050
Now, Kim, when people
wanna do tricks and fake this,

33:12.050 --> 33:14.750
you'll have to use
a rubber egg that collapses up.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.649
But you can see that's hard.
Is that a real eggshell?

33:16.649 --> 33:18.050
You can feel
that's a real eggshell, there.

33:18.050 --> 33:20.349
- Yes, that's a real egg.
- But we also have a, uh, bag.

33:20.349 --> 33:21.980
So check it out,
reach right in the bag, there.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.280
- [laughing]
- Just crawl around, there,

33:23.280 --> 33:25.020
check for secret trapdoors.

33:25.020 --> 33:27.180
Pull it right inside out--
just pull it right inside out.

33:27.180 --> 33:28.319
And check those seams,

33:28.319 --> 33:29.780
make sure those seams
are strong.

33:29.780 --> 33:31.319
There's no wormholes
to another dimension,

33:31.319 --> 33:32.550
nothing like that.
- No, all good,

33:32.550 --> 33:33.849
good French seams.
- Two pieces of cloth

33:33.849 --> 33:35.680
sewn together on three sides.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.680
Hence the term "bag."
[laughter]

33:38.680 --> 33:40.680
Now, Kim,
besides the egg in the bag,

33:40.680 --> 33:42.720
you've also got
Teller and Penn,

33:42.720 --> 33:45.349
and Teller is
a very well-known cheat.

33:45.349 --> 33:47.349
So you're here
to watch him very closely,

33:47.349 --> 33:48.520
make sure he doesn't cheat.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.720
Because if he cheats,
it's not real magic.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.180
Watch this, Kim:
He drops the egg in the bag.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.980
Then he does a magic gesture,

33:54.980 --> 33:58.419
and that egg completely
and utterly vanishes.

33:58.419 --> 34:01.450
Gone, gone, gone.
[cheering and applause]

34:01.450 --> 34:03.379
I look over at you, Kim,
and I say,

34:03.379 --> 34:05.250
"Do you have any idea
where that egg is?"

34:05.250 --> 34:07.879
And you say...
- Here.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.350
[laughs]

34:09.379 --> 34:12.750
[laughter]

34:12.850 --> 34:14.649
Right?
Am I--okay.

34:14.649 --> 34:16.120
- Maybe we should have get
a different celebrity.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.549
- Hey!
- No that's fine, that's fine.

34:17.549 --> 34:20.449
But that just shows, Kim--
it shows that you're honest.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.520
- Okay.
- That's because besides Teller

34:21.520 --> 34:23.179
being a cheat,
you also have me.

34:23.179 --> 34:25.179
- I've got eyes on you.
- And I'm loud, I'm aggressive.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.549
'cause ahh, I can sometimes
come off as a badger.

34:27.549 --> 34:29.279
Some people think
I can make people say things

34:29.279 --> 34:30.879
that aren't true, so we're
gonna watch this again.

34:30.879 --> 34:32.549
He's gonna drop the egg
in the bag.

34:32.549 --> 34:34.279
And this time,
I'll look in the bag.

34:34.279 --> 34:36.020
I can see the egg in the bag.
Kim, can you see

34:36.020 --> 34:37.250
the egg in the bag?

34:37.250 --> 34:39.219
Where is it, Kim?

34:39.219 --> 34:40.679
Reach in his pocket
and pull that out,

34:40.679 --> 34:42.049
would you, please, Kim?
[laughter]

34:42.049 --> 34:43.350
You have to watch out, Kim.

34:43.350 --> 34:46.418
You have an egg, a bag,
a cheat, and a badger.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.379
[laughter]
Now watch carefully, Kim.

34:48.379 --> 34:51.649
He takes the egg--
now tell the truth, Kim,

34:51.649 --> 34:53.350
Did he palm the egg there, Kim?
- No.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.480
- Is it palmed?
- No, it's not palmed.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.580
- Now tell the truth, Kim.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.480
Can you see the snowy-white egg

34:57.480 --> 34:58.919
in the dark interior
of the bag?

34:58.919 --> 35:00.149
- Yes.
- Now, Kim,

35:00.149 --> 35:02.649
he's put the egg
right in his palm,

35:02.649 --> 35:03.819
and just make sure
you can feel--

35:03.819 --> 35:04.819
now don't smash it,
it's real light--

35:04.819 --> 35:06.120
can you feel the egg
right there?

35:06.120 --> 35:07.549
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

35:07.549 --> 35:09.080
Hold your hands out
like this, Kim.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.850
It's like real magic,
just like that.

35:11.850 --> 35:14.350
Like the shifting sands
of the Mojave...

35:14.350 --> 35:17.819
- [gasps]
- That egg is gone, gone, gone.

35:17.819 --> 35:20.080
And, Kim, don't take
our word for it.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.450
Kim, can you see
the snowy-white egg

35:22.450 --> 35:24.520
in the dark interior
of the bag?

35:24.520 --> 35:25.819
- No!
- Can you feel the egg

35:25.819 --> 35:27.180
in the bag?
Reach right in there, Kim.

35:27.180 --> 35:28.879
Turn it right inside out, Kim,
turn it inside out.

35:28.879 --> 35:30.879
Is that egg gone, gone,
gone, gone, gone?

35:30.879 --> 35:32.250
- That egg is gone.
- Completely

35:32.250 --> 35:33.919
and utterly vanished.
- Ah!

35:33.919 --> 35:36.149
[laughing]
[cheering and applause]

35:36.149 --> 35:39.350
- But you know, Kim...

35:39.350 --> 35:40.649
- That is so good.

35:40.649 --> 35:43.149
- People that watch this show
often will say,

35:43.149 --> 35:46.649
"But, you know, magicians
sometimes use their sleeves."

35:46.649 --> 35:48.319
And there's Teller right there

35:48.319 --> 35:51.620
with a egg-sized gape
right there in his sleeve.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.750
Maybe there's some sort
of magic move

35:53.750 --> 35:55.879
where Teller flips that egg
right up his sleeve.

35:55.879 --> 35:58.520
Make sure he can't do that,
Kim, so just, uh,

35:58.520 --> 35:59.850
wrap the sleeve around
like that,

35:59.850 --> 36:01.779
and then come over the top
with your left hand.

36:01.779 --> 36:03.850
Now, Kim, make sure...

36:03.850 --> 36:05.779
his hands are empty.

36:05.779 --> 36:07.319
- Empty.
[laughter]

36:07.319 --> 36:08.950
[laughing]
- Okay, he can't use his sleeve,

36:08.950 --> 36:10.919
his hands are empty.
Can you see

36:10.919 --> 36:12.350
the snowy-white egg
in the dark interior

36:12.350 --> 36:13.649
of the bag?
- No.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.919
- Can you feel the egg
in the bag?

36:15.919 --> 36:17.520
- No.
- Then watch this, Kim.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.219
This is very close...

36:20.219 --> 36:22.279
to real...

36:22.279 --> 36:23.779
magic.
- What?

36:23.779 --> 36:25.779
- There it is, right there.
And there it is, right there.

36:25.779 --> 36:27.419
[applause]

36:27.419 --> 36:29.319
- Now, Kim...
- Oh, my gosh!

36:29.319 --> 36:32.319
[applause]

36:33.619 --> 36:36.580
- If I were a judge
on "Fool Us"--

36:36.580 --> 36:37.920
and I am--
[laughter]

36:37.920 --> 36:39.520
at this point,
I would say something obtuse

36:39.520 --> 36:41.449
about sleight of hand,
and then say,

36:41.449 --> 36:43.719
"Well, it happened
in Teller's hands."

36:43.719 --> 36:47.319
If that were real magic,
it would happen in Kim's hands.

36:47.319 --> 36:48.980
Now, Kim, you see how Teller's
holding the bag?

36:48.980 --> 36:51.080
Two fingers of each hand
inside the bag

36:51.080 --> 36:54.150
from the outside--
hold it just like that.

36:54.150 --> 36:55.380
Just like that, Kim.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.980
Now, Teller's
gonna perch the egg

36:56.980 --> 36:59.679
right on the mouth of the bag.

37:01.150 --> 37:03.020
Now, Kim, I don't want
to badger you--

37:03.020 --> 37:04.179
you can tell the truth--

37:04.179 --> 37:06.049
I just have to ask you
one question, Kim.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.119
- Yes.
- Do you see the egg?

37:08.119 --> 37:09.420
- Yes.
- Good.

37:09.420 --> 37:10.520
- I don't wanna break the egg.
[laughter]

37:10.520 --> 37:11.819
- Now watch this, Kim.

37:11.819 --> 37:14.080
This is the closest
you'll ever experience...

37:14.080 --> 37:17.080
to real magic.
- [exhales sharply]

37:17.080 --> 37:18.250
- Do you feel it, Kim?

37:18.250 --> 37:20.650
Because that egg is gone...
- [gasps]

37:20.650 --> 37:22.150
- Gone, gone.
[audience exclaims]

37:22.150 --> 37:24.150
And don't take
our word for it, Kim,

37:24.150 --> 37:25.650
check his pockets!

37:25.650 --> 37:27.549
Check his sleeves!

37:27.549 --> 37:29.920
That is gone, gone.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.480
- That is gone.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.819
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

37:32.819 --> 37:34.750
If you check any more, Kim,

37:34.750 --> 37:36.549
you can't be in the Senate.
- I know!

37:36.549 --> 37:37.549
[laughter]

37:37.549 --> 37:38.949
I was trying
to be very careful.

37:38.949 --> 37:41.949
- Now, Kim, that still happened
in your hands,

37:41.949 --> 37:44.179
but Teller
was awfully near to you.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.819
If that were real magic,

37:45.819 --> 37:48.520
it could happen
when you're alone.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.449
One last time, Kim,
take a look in the bag.

37:50.449 --> 37:52.049
Do you see the snowy-white egg

37:52.049 --> 37:53.219
in the dark interior
of the bag?

37:53.219 --> 37:55.080
- No.
- Do you feel the egg

37:55.080 --> 37:56.449
in the bag?
- No.

37:56.449 --> 37:57.850
- So you can't see it,
you can't feel it.

37:57.850 --> 38:00.449
You gotta hold it.
Hold it just like that, Kim.

38:00.449 --> 38:02.619
Now, Kim, do you feel alone
here on stage?

38:02.619 --> 38:03.719
We'll move a little further
away from you.

38:03.719 --> 38:05.279
- Okay.
- Feel alone now, Kim?

38:05.279 --> 38:06.350
- Yes.
- We'll move

38:06.350 --> 38:07.449
a little further away.

38:07.449 --> 38:09.449
Now, Kim,
you checked completely,

38:09.449 --> 38:11.580
but one last time,
little peek in the bag.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.679
Do you see the egg in the bag?
- No.

38:14.679 --> 38:16.580
- Kim, keep holding--

38:16.580 --> 38:17.980
keep holding
with your right hand.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.420
Let go with your left.
- Just with my right hand?

38:19.420 --> 38:22.350
- Teller, magic!

38:22.350 --> 38:23.350
[snaps fingers]

38:23.350 --> 38:26.380
Kim, show your left hand empty.

38:26.380 --> 38:29.219
Slowly, carefully,
reach in the bag.

38:29.219 --> 38:30.679
- I'm gonna cry.
- Reach in the bag.

38:30.679 --> 38:32.549
- [gasps]
- Be careful, Kim,

38:32.549 --> 38:33.750
[laughter]

38:33.750 --> 38:35.750
- It's here!
- It's a real egg.

38:35.750 --> 38:38.049
Kim Raver!
[cheering and applause]

38:38.049 --> 38:40.619
- That's amazing.
You guys are amazing.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.819
- That's Kim Raver
right there.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.949
[Alyson laughing]

38:42.949 --> 38:46.150
[cheering and applause]

38:46.150 --> 38:47.819
That was so good.

38:47.819 --> 38:49.779
- That's amazing.
- Ah!

38:49.779 --> 38:51.750
That's a wrap
on tonight's show,

38:51.750 --> 38:53.350
but we'll come back
with another one

38:53.350 --> 38:54.779
before you know it!

38:54.779 --> 38:58.819
From all of us at "Fool Us,"
goodnight from Las Vegas!

38:58.819 --> 39:00.650
[all chattering]

39:00.650 --> 39:03.650
[cheering and applause]
