00:43.920 --> 00:45.280
<i>Okay, you ready for this?</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:47.240
<i>As ever.
Let's do it.</i>

00:47.320 --> 00:50.240
<i>Let's play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i>

00:52.000 --> 00:54.960
<i>Who wrote the phrase "No man is an island"?</i>

00:56.320 --> 00:58.920
<i>John Donne? John Milton?</i>

00:59.600 --> 01:01.160
<i>John F. Kennedy?</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:03.600
<i>Jon Bon Jovi?</i>

01:04.160 --> 01:06.320
Jon Bon Jovi. Too easy.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.400
<i>And, if I may say so,
a complete load of bollocks.</i>

01:11.480 --> 01:13.920
<i>In my opinion, all men are islands.</i>

01:15.240 --> 01:18.080
<i>And what's more, now's the time to be one.</i>

01:18.160 --> 01:19.920
<i>This is an island age.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:22.960
<i>A hundred years ago,
you had to depend on other people.</i>

01:23.080 --> 01:25.960
<i>No one had TV or CDs or DVDs or videos...</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:27.640
<i>...or home espresso makers.</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:29.560
<i>Actually, they didn't have anything cool.</i>

01:29.640 --> 01:30.600
<i>Whereas now, you see...</i>

01:30.680 --> 01:33.120
<i>...you can make yourself a little island paradise.</i>

01:33.200 --> 01:35.920
<i>With the right supplies and the right attitude...</i>

01:36.000 --> 01:38.800
<i>...you can be sun-drenched, tropical, a magnet...</i>

01:38.880 --> 01:41.200
<i>...for young Swedish tourists.</i>

01:41.280 --> 01:44.320
Hi, it's Kristina.
I haven't heard from you.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.160
I had a great time last weekend.
So give me a call, okay? 'Bye.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.240
<i>And I like to think that perhaps
I am that kind of island.</i>

01:52.520 --> 01:54.960
<i>I like to think I'm pretty cool.</i>

01:55.640 --> 01:57.680
<i>I like to think I'm Ibiza.</i>

02:05.600 --> 02:08.360
<i>There were people who had
a good time in life.</i>

02:08.440 --> 02:11.320
<i>I was beginning to realize I wasn't one of them.</i>

02:11.400 --> 02:13.120
<i>I just didn't fit.</i>

02:13.200 --> 02:14.960
<i>I didn't fit at my old school.</i>

02:15.040 --> 02:17.720
<i>I definitely didn't fit at my new one.</i>

02:18.920 --> 02:21.800
<i>I heard that some kids
got taught by their parents at home.</i>

02:21.880 --> 02:24.320
<i>Mum couldn't do that,
unless I paid her to teach me.</i>

02:24.440 --> 02:27.440
<i>Because it was just her and me.
And she went to work.</i>

02:27.560 --> 02:29.400
<i>She made 400 pounds a week.</i>

02:29.480 --> 02:31.560
<i>Where was I gonna get that kind of money from?</i>

02:31.640 --> 02:34.560
<i>Maybe if I was like that movie kid,
Haley Joel Osment...</i>

02:34.640 --> 02:36.240
<i>...I could pay her that much.</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:38.720
<i>But if that meant being good at drama, forget it.</i>

02:38.800 --> 02:40.000
<i>I was crap at drama.</i>

02:40.120 --> 02:42.360
<i>'Cause I hated standing up in front of people.</i>

02:42.440 --> 02:44.960
<i>So, basically, I had to go to school.</i>

02:59.040 --> 03:01.640
<i>The sad fact is that,
like any island dweller...</i>

03:01.720 --> 03:05.400
<i>...from time to time I had to visit the mainland.</i>

03:13.520 --> 03:16.640
This is Imogene.
You can hold her if you like.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.320
That's... Well, okay.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.400
Yeah. Got her. Lovely.

03:26.880 --> 03:31.200
Yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?

03:31.720 --> 03:33.440
I know. Isn't she?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.840
To tell the truth,
I'm being crap with her.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.080
You better take her back.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.880
She could've been yours
if you got your act together.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.960
Just think of that, yeah.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.880
So, the place is looking really nice.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.920
Barney, Barney, Barney.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.120
Say hello to Will, Barney.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.960
Here we go. It's the Antichrist.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.480
Hello, Barney. How are you?

04:03.240 --> 04:05.240
- He's lovely.
- Yeah.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.160
And what about you, Will?
Any desire for a family of your own yet?

04:09.240 --> 04:10.920
<i>I'd rather eat Barney's nappies.</i>

04:11.040 --> 04:13.200
Not really. I'm sort of all right as I am.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.800
Please, Will.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.399
What does that mean? "Please" what?

04:17.480 --> 04:18.720
Look at yourself.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.120
You're 38 and you've never had a job...

04:22.200 --> 04:25.080
...or a relationship
that lasted longer than two months.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.800
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.080
I mean, I would say you were a disaster.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.440
I mean, what is the point of your life?

04:33.680 --> 04:34.720
Bloody hell.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.400
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life...

04:37.440 --> 04:39.600
...but thank you for bringing it up.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.720
The reason we wanted you to come here today
was we wanted to ask you...

04:46.240 --> 04:49.200
...how would you like to be
Imogene's godfather?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.760
Seriously?
Seriously.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.640
Listen, I'm really, really touched.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.760
But you must be joking.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.760
I couldn't possibly think
of a worse godfather for Imogene.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.320
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.560
I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th,
when I'll take her out and get her drunk...

05:09.640 --> 05:12.880
...and possibly, let's face it,
you know, try and shag her.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.360
I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.440
We know, I just thought you had hidden depths.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.440
No. No. You've always had that wrong.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.200
I really am this shallow.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.360
Here we are.

05:31.240 --> 05:35.000
You know you don't have to walk me
to school anymore now, Mum.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.840
I know the way now.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.880
But what if I like walking you to school?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.160
Right.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.200
Who are you?

05:48.280 --> 05:49.320
I'm me.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.200
And what are you not?

05:51.360 --> 05:52.240
A sheep.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.360
Right. And what does a sheep go?

06:04.320 --> 06:05.360
Marcus?

06:08.520 --> 06:10.040
I love you.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.440
Look.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.480
I love you, too.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.800
"I love you, Marcus!"

06:28.320 --> 06:29.400
"Love you!"

06:30.280 --> 06:31.720
Look at him!

06:35.920 --> 06:38.280
While I couldn't accept the offer...

06:38.400 --> 06:40.240
...to become their child's godfather...

06:40.400 --> 06:44.960
...I did allow them to set me up with Angie,
a rather beautiful coworker of Christine's.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.520
They had, however, being them,
neglected to tell me one thing.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.920
There's something you don't know about me.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.760
Yeah?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.000
Something exciting?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.720
I think so, yes.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.800
I have a 3-year-old boy.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.480
I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor,
push over the table and run.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.240
Brilliant. I love kids.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.480
Yeah. I like messing about with them.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.240
Doing kid things.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.440
I'd have been disappointed
if you didn't have a child.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.320
Why do you say that?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.040
<i>God knows.</i>

07:26.480 --> 07:29.440
<i>Mainly because it sounded smooth and winning.</i>

07:29.960 --> 07:34.800
Because I love kids so much. They're so lovely.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.920
<i>What in God's name are you saying,
you idiot?</i>

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
<i>She can't be buying this rubbish.</i>

07:44.920 --> 07:46.760
<i>But she did buy my rubbish.</i>

07:46.880 --> 07:50.320
<i>And for the next few weeks
I was suddenly Will the Good Guy.</i>

07:50.400 --> 07:53.280
<i>Her kid took to me,
mainly because on our first meeting...</i>

07:53.360 --> 07:56.640
<i>...I took him to the zoo
and held him upside down by his ankles.</i>

07:56.720 --> 07:59.160
<i>I wish relationships
with proper humans were that easy.</i>

07:59.240 --> 08:00.920
You know, you are brilliant.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.200
<i>I came to realize that with single mums...</i>

08:03.320 --> 08:05.360
<i>...particularly ones who'd been badly treated...</i>

08:05.440 --> 08:10.920
<i>...and eventually abandoned by the father
of their children, you became by comparison...</i>

08:11.000 --> 08:13.160
You are a wonderful person.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.920
No, I'm not.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.480
<i>But it was hard
to be wonderful all the time.</i>

08:18.560 --> 08:23.000
<i>Eventually I began to wonder whether
Angie was exactly what I was looking for.</i>

08:23.160 --> 08:27.520
<i>For instance, she was late for the new IMAX
movie because the babysitter hadn't turned up.</i>

08:27.600 --> 08:29.680
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.920
<i>That pissed me off.</i>

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
- You okay?
- Yes.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.039
<i>And there were deeper problems.</i>

08:34.120 --> 08:38.120
<i>She couldn't stay at my place,
and she didn't have a DVD, or satellite or cable.</i>

08:38.200 --> 08:42.400
<i>So we were always stuck watching some crap
made-for-TV movie about a kid with leukemia.</i>

08:42.520 --> 08:45.040
<i>I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do.</i>

08:45.120 --> 08:48.320
<i>God! No! Please, please, no!</i>

08:48.880 --> 08:50.520
<i>I was going to have to end it.</i>

08:50.600 --> 08:52.200
<i>But having been Will the Good Guy...</i>

08:52.280 --> 08:56.880
<i>...I didn't relish going back to my role of Will
the Unreliable, Emotionally-stunted Asshole.</i>

08:56.960 --> 08:58.040
I'm sorry?

08:58.240 --> 09:01.080
You're breaking up with me? You...

09:01.160 --> 09:03.520
...self-centered bastard.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.760
I can't believe I've wasted all this time with you!

09:08.040 --> 09:12.200
You useless, superficial loser.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.120
Will...

09:19.200 --> 09:21.000
<i>Then something magical happened.</i>

09:21.080 --> 09:22.280
I'm sorry.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.920
I'm not sure this is working out. It's not you.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.080
You've been great. It's me.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.400
Well, my situation with Louie and his dad.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.440
I'm not ready to launch into a relationship
with anybody new.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.840
Yeah.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.680
I'm so sorry.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.640
I think I understand.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.360
You're a wonderful man, Will.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.720
<i>I'd never watched a woman
cry without feeling responsible before.</i>

10:05.840 --> 10:09.120
<i>She even wanted me to forgive her.
It felt amazing.</i>

10:09.200 --> 10:13.000
Listen, you don't have anything
to feel sorry about. Really.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.200
<i>So that was the end of Angie,
but the beginning of a whole new thing.</i>

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
<i>Single mums.</i>

10:18.360 --> 10:20.720
<i>Why hadn't anyone told me about them before?</i>

10:20.800 --> 10:24.640
<i>Passionate sex, a lot of ego massage
and a guilt-free parting.</i>

10:24.720 --> 10:28.880
<i>There must be thousands, just waiting
for a nice guy to sleep with and break up with.</i>

10:28.960 --> 10:31.840
<i>Fabulous, sexy, gorgeous single mums.</i>

10:34.760 --> 10:36.520
Can I have Cocoa Puffs?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.280
No, it's not Sunday.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.400
<i>The crying had started again.
And it scared me...</i>

10:42.800 --> 10:44.360
<i>...'cause now it was in the mornings.</i>

10:44.520 --> 10:46.400
<i>She'd never done that before.</i>

10:49.480 --> 10:52.280
<i>I couldn't figure it out. Nobody was dead.</i>

10:52.680 --> 10:56.760
<i>She had a job as a music therapist,
which is kind of a teacher for sick kids.</i>

10:57.040 --> 10:59.360
<i>So there was enough money
for food and everything.</i>

10:59.440 --> 11:01.120
Should I get my own breakfast?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.880
No, I'm doing it.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.080
So, you looking forward to school today?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.280
Today, you'll need to effect...

11:19.400 --> 11:22.200
...the decimal point when you multiply it by 10...

11:22.280 --> 11:24.520
...100 and 1000.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.160
"Nothing to do but frown

11:29.520 --> 11:34.440
"Rainy days and Mondays always get me down"

11:38.920 --> 11:41.040
Thank you very much, Marcus.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.800
Hi, Nicky. Hi, Mark.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.240
- Are you going to Computer Club later?
- I don't know. Marcus...

11:57.080 --> 11:59.280
Madonna! Go on, give us a song!

11:59.360 --> 12:00.800
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.720
Spice Girls or something. Three of them.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.080
Yeah. Hey, Spice Girls.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.560
You made me lose my football.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.760
Marcus, we don't really want you
hanging around with us anymore.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.240
- Why not?
- Well, it's because of them.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.520
- They've got nothing to do with me.
- Yes, they do.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.960
We never had trouble with them
before we started hanging out with you.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.320
Now we get it every single day.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.840
Besides, everyone thinks you're weird.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.600
Only a bit, though.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.080
Okay.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.800
'Bye.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.440
<i>There you have it.</i>

12:44.720 --> 12:48.640
<i>I was having a shit time at home
and a shit time at school.</i>

12:52.200 --> 12:55.000
<i>It was fine deciding
single mums were the future...</i>

12:55.080 --> 12:57.960
<i>...but the frustrating truth was
I didn't have their numbers.</i>

12:58.040 --> 13:00.200
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.880
<i>Where did they hang out?</i>

13:26.240 --> 13:28.880
I'm a single father,
I have a 2-year-old boy.

13:28.960 --> 13:33.280
I'm a single father, I have a 2-year-old boy.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.040
I'm a single father, I have a 2-year-old boy.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
<i>SPAT.</i>

13:37.920 --> 13:39.200
<i>This was exciting.</i>

13:39.320 --> 13:41.920
<i>A potential gold mine of single mums.</i>

13:42.000 --> 13:44.960
<i>I could see the beautiful creatures now,
getting roaring drunk...</i>

13:45.040 --> 13:47.880
<i>...forgetting their troubles,
ready to rock and roll.</i>

13:47.960 --> 13:50.280
That was when
I was 7 months pregnant.

13:50.360 --> 13:54.560
By the time I had the baby,
he was in Majorca with another woman.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.880
Not even the one
he cheated on me with the first time.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.640
Well, with me, it was the week before the birth.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.760
He said I'd got too fat.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.560
Mine was shagging his secretary.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.640
Such a cliche.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.840
<i>I'll tell you one thing: Men are bastards.</i>

14:15.120 --> 14:16.200
<i>After about 10 minutes...</i>

14:16.280 --> 14:19.440
<i>...I wanted to cut my own penis off
with a kitchen knife.</i>

14:22.400 --> 14:23.440
Me.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.360
Yes.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.360
I have a 2-year-old. Ned.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.280
He's got blue eyes
and sort of sandy-colored hair...

14:35.360 --> 14:37.480
...and he's about 2'3".

14:39.040 --> 14:40.800
And his mum left.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.640
Yeah, I mean,
obviously it was a very big shock...

14:47.880 --> 14:50.200
...because we were so happy, you know?

14:50.280 --> 14:53.720
Sandra's neurology practice
was just up and running...

14:54.360 --> 14:58.720
...and then one day her bags were packed,
and my best friend was waiting outside...

14:58.800 --> 15:00.200
...in his Ferrari.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.920
Yeah. You know, the Modena?

15:02.000 --> 15:06.880
The one with the supercharged engine,
where you can see it through the back window?

15:08.200 --> 15:11.280
- You got dumped then?
- Yeah.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.080
May I ask, does your ex see Ned at all?

15:20.280 --> 15:22.440
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.800
Suzie.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.280
Suzie.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.200
She doesn't see much of him, no.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.640
How does he cope with that?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.440
He's a very good little boy.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.720
Very, very brave.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.040
They've got amazing resources, don't they?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.640
Just the other day I was thinking about my ex.

15:39.720 --> 15:44.120
He came crawling up, put his little pudgy arms
around my neck, and he said:

15:44.360 --> 15:46.120
"You hang in there, Dad. "

15:46.640 --> 15:48.960
God, that's amazing for a 2-year-old!

15:50.120 --> 15:51.240
Is it?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.480
Yeah, he's very special. Very, very special.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.400
Sometimes I think, you know,
he's the one taking care of me.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.920
Teaching me the ways of the world.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.360
Sorry.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.320
Thank you.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.400
<i>My God, what a performancel
I was even fooling myself.</i>

16:18.920 --> 16:21.120
<i>There you go. You okay?</i>

16:21.200 --> 16:22.520
Yeah. Perfect, thanks.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.040
- Trust me?
- Of course.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.720
<i>By the end of the evening,
I had a date lined up.</i>

16:26.800 --> 16:28.720
Single parents alone together!

16:28.800 --> 16:32.920
Single parents alone togetherl
All for one and one for alll

16:35.160 --> 16:39.040
<i>The problem was I also had
an imaginary 2-year-old son.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:12.480
<i>The date was a SPAT picnic in Regent's Park,
with everyone bringing their kids.</i>

17:13.000 --> 17:14.359
<i>Sadly, Ned couldn't be there.</i>

17:14.440 --> 17:17.000
<i>His mum had come
and picked him up at the last second.</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:18.599
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.839
I'm sorry.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.160
- Got it.
- This is Megan, by the way.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.720
Hello, Megan.

17:24.839 --> 17:25.640
Yeah.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.040
A friend of mine from SPAT
isn't feeling so great...

17:28.119 --> 17:30.720
...so I said that we'd take her kid
to the picnic, too.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.800
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.240
The more the merrier. Right.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.040
Come on, slowcoach!

17:40.320 --> 17:41.800
<i>I hated that SPAT-lot.</i>

17:41.880 --> 17:47.000
<i>Mum's friend Suzie was fine, but now there
was that wally who wanted to get off with her.</i>

17:47.080 --> 17:48.960
Marcus, Will. Will, Marcus.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.640
Hi there.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.160
Right.

17:53.240 --> 17:58.080
Pile in, everyone.
Look what a mess Ned made of the car seat.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.400
What a shame he can't come.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.560
So, what do you do?

18:04.320 --> 18:05.200
Me?

18:06.400 --> 18:09.800
<i>There were too many lies
to keep track of so I told the truth.</i>

18:09.920 --> 18:13.200
- Nothing.
- Well, before then.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.480
- What do you mean, before I did nothing?
- Yeah.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.400
I did nothing.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.400
You've never worked?

18:21.600 --> 18:26.000
I've done the odd day here and there, but, no.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.920
Crazy, isn't it?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.280
It's...

18:34.440 --> 18:35.440
Brilliant.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.360
<i>My God, I was going to have to tell her.</i>

18:39.440 --> 18:44.040
What happened, in fact,
was that my dad wrote a song...

18:44.120 --> 18:47.840
...in 1958, and it's quite a famous song...

18:47.960 --> 18:51.200
...and I basically live off the royalties of that.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.600
You know Michael Jackson?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.480
He makes a £1,000,000 a minute.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.720
That's £60,000,000 an hour.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.520
I don't make a £1,000,000 a minute.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.360
- Nothing like, sadly.
- How much then?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.520
Marcus!

19:01.640 --> 19:05.440
<i>I was beginning to wonder
if we'd be stuck with this weird kid all day.</i>

19:05.560 --> 19:07.560
So, what's this song then?

19:08.280 --> 19:11.280
If you can live off it, we must've heard of it.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.720
It's Santa's Super Sleigh.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.920
God, please don't sing it.

19:16.160 --> 19:21.360
"Look who's coming round the bend
It's Santa and his reindeer friends

19:21.440 --> 19:26.080
"With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, hey,
It's Santa's super sleigh"

19:27.040 --> 19:29.240
I expect people do that all the time.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.920
No, I think you two are the first.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.800
Sorry. I don't understand.
How does that make you money?

19:36.280 --> 19:38.240
Do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent?

19:38.320 --> 19:41.680
They should, but you can't
always catch the little bastards.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.800
So, how often do you look after him?
Marcus.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.880
Every once in a while.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.880
His mum's a little off-color sometimes.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.320
You call it off-color, I call it nuts.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.720
She's not nuts, Marcus.
She just needs a weekend taking it easy.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.520
We'll have a nice picnic, and when
you get home, she'll be all rested up.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.320
My God! What the hell is that?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.120
My mum's homemade bread.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.040
It looks pretty good.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.160
No, it isn't. It's healthy.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.640
You miss him, don't you?

20:51.480 --> 20:52.320
Who?

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
Ned!

20:56.320 --> 20:57.320
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.120
Yeah, very much.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.840
He'd have loved this.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.400
I think I killed a duck.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.760
I was only trying to feed it.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.800
What's that floating
in the water next to it?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.720
Is that your mum's bread?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.320
You didn't have to throw the whole loaf.
That would've killed me.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.200
You the one who was throwing
bloody great loaves at the ducks?

21:24.360 --> 21:27.160
Yeah, he was, but I've stopped him now.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.560
You know, boys will be boys, and all that.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.560
So he killed it.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.640
No. Sorry, I misunderstood you.
The duck was dead already.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.400
He was throwing bread
to try and sink the body...

21:36.480 --> 21:38.880
...because Megan here was getting upset.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.360
Marcus wouldn't kill a duck.
Would you, Marcus?

21:44.440 --> 21:48.160
No. I love ducks. They're my
second favorite animal after dolphins.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.880
They can kill sharks with their noses.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.480
I'll have to wade in and get it.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.800
Listen, I hope it's not some sort of epidemic.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.000
I think we beat the rap there, mate.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.320
Yeah. Well.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.120
Marcus?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.480
Mum.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.640
<i>That day, the Dead Duck Day,
was when it all began.</i>

22:30.360 --> 22:34.440
<i>That bloke Will just followed us in
and I didn't tell him not to.</i>

22:34.600 --> 22:38.680
<i>Afterwards, I realized that there was no way
I could have been nervous just then...</i>

22:38.760 --> 22:42.560
<i>...because just then I didn't know
there was anything to be nervous about.</i>

22:42.640 --> 22:45.480
<i>But then I put the key in the lock,
opened the door...</i>

22:45.560 --> 22:46.720
<i>Are you decent?</i>

22:47.280 --> 22:49.680
<i>And a new part of my life started.</i>

22:49.760 --> 22:50.880
<i>Bangl</i>

22:56.440 --> 22:57.880
Jesus Christ.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.000
Oh, my God.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.800
- Will, call an ambulance.
- Marcus, where's the phone?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.920
Where's the phone, mate?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.880
<i>It was horrible. Horrible.</i>

23:24.560 --> 23:27.760
<i>But driving fast behind the ambulance
was fantastic.</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:29.560
She's conscious.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.720
She was okay in the ambulance.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.240
She was asking after you, Marcus.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.040
That's nice of her.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.720
Listen, you know this has
nothing to do with you, don't you?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.920
I mean, you're not the reason that she...

23:43.200 --> 23:46.840
You're not the reason that she's here.
Isn't that right, Will?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.400
Yeah, that's right.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.600
I'll go get you some water.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.720
- I can get that.
- No, it's okay.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.880
Your mum's going to be okay.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.280
Yeah, I suppose.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.400
That's not the point, though, is it?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.440
Right, you mean you're afraid
she might try again?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.360
Just shut up, all right?

24:18.080 --> 24:20.120
There you go, warm and flat.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.760
Are you with Fiona Brewer?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.200
Yes, I'm her friend Suzie.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.960
This is Marcus and Will.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.600
She's recovering well,
but we'll keep her overnight.

24:28.720 --> 24:33.400
I'm going to get a consent form for Ms. Brewer
so the boy can stay with you two tonight.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.800
Right.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.280
So, my place or yours?

24:39.800 --> 24:40.920
Sorry.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.720
Okay.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.360
- I should get back to Ned, I think.
- I'll take that.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.720
All right.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.800
<i>All in all, this was very interesting.</i>

25:00.920 --> 25:02.920
So I'll call.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.400
<i>But I wouldn't want to do it every night.</i>

25:05.480 --> 25:06.520
See you soon.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.560
<i>The thing is,
a person's life is like a TV show.</i>

25:09.720 --> 25:11.920
<i>I was the star of The Will Show.</i>

25:12.040 --> 25:15.080
<i>And The Will Show wasn't an ensemble drama.</i>

25:15.240 --> 25:17.680
<i>Guests came and went, but I was the regular.</i>

25:17.760 --> 25:20.080
<i>It came down to me, and me alone.</i>

25:20.520 --> 25:23.400
<i>If Marcus' mum
couldn't manage her own show...</i>

25:23.480 --> 25:27.360
<i>...if her ratings were falling,
it was sad, but that was her problem.</i>

25:27.480 --> 25:32.360
<i>Ultimately, the whole single-mum plot line
was a bit complicated for me.</i>

27:01.280 --> 27:04.120
I got the letter. Thanks.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.040
Oh, my God. I'd forgotten.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.520
You forgot?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.160
You forgot a suicide letter?

27:14.240 --> 27:17.520
I didn't think I'd have to remember it, did I?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.520
Did you read the part
where I said I'd always love you?

27:24.600 --> 27:27.520
It's a bit hard for you
to love me when you're dead, isn't it?

27:27.600 --> 27:28.920
I'm sorry.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.840
I can understand why you're angry, Marcus.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.280
I don't feel the same as I did yesterday,
if that's any help.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.280
What?

27:49.720 --> 27:51.480
It's all just gone away? All that?

27:51.960 --> 27:52.960
No, but...

27:54.240 --> 27:57.360
...at the moment, I feel better.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.520
"At the moment" is no good to me.

27:59.640 --> 28:03.160
I can see you feel better at the moment.
You just put the kettle on.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.160
But what happens when you finish your tea?
What happens when I go back to school?

28:07.240 --> 28:10.600
- I can't be here to watch you all the time.
- I know.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.560
We have to look after each other. The two of us.

28:16.440 --> 28:20.160
<i>Suddenly I realized
two people isn't enough.</i>

28:20.600 --> 28:21.800
<i>You need a backup.</i>

28:21.880 --> 28:25.040
<i>If you're only two people,
and someone drops off the edge...</i>

28:25.120 --> 28:26.600
<i>...then you're on your own.</i>

28:26.680 --> 28:28.320
<i>Two isn't a large enough number.</i>

28:28.400 --> 28:30.280
You need three, at least.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.200
- Three what?
- Nothing.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.400
<i>But I'd had a great idea.</i>

28:36.480 --> 28:39.920
<i>The important thing in island living
is to be your own activities director.</i>

28:40.000 --> 28:42.680
<i>I find the key is to think of a day
as units of time...</i>

28:42.720 --> 28:46.000
<i>...each unit consisting
of no more than 30 minutes.</i>

28:46.080 --> 28:48.360
<i>Full hours can be a little bit intimidating...</i>

28:48.480 --> 28:50.800
<i>...and most activities take about half an hour.</i>

28:50.880 --> 28:52.560
<i>Taking a bath: One unit.</i>

28:53.120 --> 28:54.440
<i>Watching Countdown:</i>

28:54.520 --> 28:55.840
<i>Okay...</i>

28:56.160 --> 28:57.240
<i>One unit.</i>

28:58.120 --> 29:00.080
<i>Web-based research:</i>

29:01.680 --> 29:02.640
<i>Two units.</i>

29:02.720 --> 29:06.080
<i>Exercising: Three units.</i>

29:06.920 --> 29:09.600
<i>Having my hair carefully disheveled: Four units.</i>

29:09.680 --> 29:11.760
<i>It's amazing how the day fills up.</i>

29:11.880 --> 29:13.880
<i>I often wonder, to be absolutely honest...</i>

29:13.960 --> 29:16.520
<i>...if I'd ever really have time for a job.</i>

29:17.400 --> 29:19.360
<i>How do people cram them in?</i>

29:24.560 --> 29:25.840
Yeah, Will here.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.160
It's Marcus.
Pardon?

29:28.320 --> 29:29.520
It's Marcus.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.720
Marcus?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.680
Marcus. Hi.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.440
How'd you get my number?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.560
From Suzie.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.440
I thought you'd like to take me out for the day
on Saturday.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.320
And why did you think that, Marcus?

29:42.400 --> 29:44.040
Suzie said we hit it off.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.840
Did she?
Yeah.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.760
- And you said, "See you soon. "
- I said what?

29:48.840 --> 29:49.800
"See you soon."

29:49.960 --> 29:53.520
The night you dropped us off. Remember?
You said, "See you soon. "

29:53.680 --> 29:57.480
This is soon, all right, Marcus.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.880
The thing is, mate,
my life is kind of hectic at the moment.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.960
Why? I thought you did nothing.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.800
I've got Ned and stuff to look after.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.520
Matter of fact, I should be on the way
to preschool right now.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.800
What's that noise?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.400
That's a lawn mower.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.120
So, you know, just time-wise it's not...

30:18.640 --> 30:21.680
Tell you what, just hold the line one sec.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.520
Hold on, one sec. Thanks.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.560
<i>But then I thought, "Why not?"</i>

30:25.640 --> 30:28.280
<i>Why shouldn't I take
the poor little sod out for a meal?</i>

30:28.360 --> 30:31.520
<i>I could be Uncle Will.
Cool Uncle Will, King of the Kids.</i>

30:33.080 --> 30:35.000
Okay, Marcus. You're on.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.000
I'll come if you take my mum, too.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.920
She has no money, so we'll have to go
somewhere cheap or you'll have to treat us.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.320
Listen, don't beat about the bush, Marcus.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.280
Why should I? We're poor.
You're rich. You pay.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.120
Bring your little boy, I don't mind.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.520
That's really big of you.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.600
Fine. Come round at 12:30 or something.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.880
Remember where we live?

30:52.960 --> 30:57.120
Flat 2, 31 Craysfield Road,
Islington, London, N12SF.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.720
England, the world, the universe.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.320
Yeah.
Marcus?

31:06.200 --> 31:09.280
So, Fiona, how are you?

31:10.600 --> 31:15.000
- I mean, how are you feeling?
- My stomach's fine.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.200
Great.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.000
I must still be a bit barmy, though.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.080
This kind of thing doesn't go away overnight,
does it?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
No.

31:28.480 --> 31:32.440
<i>If Mum was going to get Will to marry
her, she'd have to quit making jokes.</i>

31:32.560 --> 31:33.600
<i>At least she looked good.</i>

31:33.680 --> 31:35.320
<i>I had her put on that nice hairy jumper...</i>

31:35.440 --> 31:38.280
<i>...and the earrings she got from her friend
that went to Zimbabwe.</i>

31:38.440 --> 31:40.600
<i>The kid seemed to think
this was a date.</i>

31:40.680 --> 31:42.880
<i>As for his mum, she was clearly insane...</i>

31:42.960 --> 31:46.000
<i>...and appeared to be wearing
some kind of Yeti costume.</i>

31:46.080 --> 31:49.160
<i>This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.</i>

31:49.240 --> 31:50.800
I'll start with the artichoke, please.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.880
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries
and a Coke.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.840
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.120
I'd never have guessed.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.480
Steak sandwich, please, mate. Thanks.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.080
<i>This was going really well.</i>

32:06.160 --> 32:10.040
<i>I wondered if we were going to move into
Will's place or move into someplace new.</i>

32:12.120 --> 32:16.200
"I heard he sang a good song

32:16.840 --> 32:19.720
"I heard he had a style"

32:21.360 --> 32:24.000
<i>I knew, of course,
the song couldn't last forever...</i>

32:24.080 --> 32:26.560
<i>...that I'd soon be at home, tucked up in bed.</i>

32:26.640 --> 32:29.000
<i>I knew it, but I couldn't feel it.</i>

32:30.440 --> 32:33.600
"And there he was, this young boy"

32:33.880 --> 32:36.960
<i>I must've been insane.
All I'd wanted was a date with Suzie.</i>

32:37.080 --> 32:38.440
<i>This was my punishment.</i>

32:38.520 --> 32:42.640
"Strumming my pain with his fingers"

32:44.120 --> 32:46.800
<i>The worst part was
when they closed their eyes.</i>

32:46.960 --> 32:49.720
"Killing me softly with his song

32:49.800 --> 32:51.520
"Killing me softly"

32:52.200 --> 32:53.840
Come sing with us, Will.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.760
I should really get going. Thanks.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.040
<i>That's the problem with charity.
You must mean it.</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:02.800
<i>You have to mean things to help people.</i>

33:02.880 --> 33:06.480
<i>Like the time I volunteered
to help out at a soup kitchen...</i>

33:06.560 --> 33:08.840
<i>...and very nearly made it.</i>

33:08.920 --> 33:10.880
<i>Or the time at Amnesty International.</i>

33:10.960 --> 33:14.680
Did you know in Burma you get seven years
in prison for telling jokes?

33:14.760 --> 33:18.160
Next time you laugh, think of Pa Pa Lay,
the Burmese standup comedian.

33:18.240 --> 33:21.160
We're at a crucial stage
in our struggle for human rights...

33:21.240 --> 33:23.960
...which have been grossly abused
by the ruling junta.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.560
We need your support more than ever.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.480
Together we can make a difference...

33:27.560 --> 33:30.720
You're kidding.
And what's your boyfriend say about that?

33:31.040 --> 33:34.120
Wait a minute.
You say you haven't got a boyfriend?

33:34.200 --> 33:36.680
Talk about human rights violations.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.160
Is that right? You're in the bath now?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.520
<i>You have to mean things to help people.</i>

33:47.600 --> 33:49.280
<i>Fiona meant Killing Me Softly.</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:53.760
<i>Killing Me Softly meant something to her
and look where she ended up.</i>

33:55.640 --> 33:59.560
<i>Me, I didn't mean anything, about anything,
to anyone.</i>

33:59.840 --> 34:03.360
<i>I knew that guaranteed me
a long, depression-free life.</i>

34:31.480 --> 34:34.719
<i>Yet over the next few days,
I did have a strange feeling.</i>

34:34.800 --> 34:37.320
<i>Like a presence lurking at the back of my mind.</i>

34:37.440 --> 34:39.120
<i>And I didn't like it.</i>

34:52.080 --> 34:54.280
You don't have a kid, do you?

34:55.560 --> 34:56.400
What?

34:56.480 --> 34:58.680
You don't have a kid, do you?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.720
Of course I do! What are you on about?

35:00.800 --> 35:01.840
No, you don't.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.040
I've been watching you,
and you don't have a kid.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.320
What is it to you, anyway?
Nothing.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.560
Except you've been lying to me,
my mum and my mum's friend.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.720
- Can I come in?
- No.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.880
Why?

35:16.960 --> 35:17.920
'Cause I'm busy.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.120
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching TV.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.280
I could watch it with you, if you like.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.680
That's very nice of you...

35:26.760 --> 35:28.920
...but I usually manage on my own, thanks.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.920
Don't you have homework to do, or something?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.880
- Want to help?
- No, that's not what I meant.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.080
I meant, why don't you go home
and do your homework?

35:38.160 --> 35:39.680
I'll do you a deal.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.840
I won't tell anyone you don't have a kid
if you go out with my mum.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.240
You'd want your mum
to go out with someone like me?

35:50.360 --> 35:51.720
You're not too bad.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.880
I mean, you told lies,
but apart from that you seem okay.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.280
And she's sad. I think she'd like a boyfriend.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.480
I can't just go out with someone...

36:01.560 --> 36:04.800
...because you want me to.
I'd have to like the person, as well.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.440
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her, it's just the system.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.280
That's how it...
I'm not talking about this with you.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.600
Just go.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.520
Okay. But I'll be back.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.520
I'm really scared!

36:18.080 --> 36:21.680
<i>That's the best I could come up with,
"I'm scared."</i>

36:21.920 --> 36:24.880
<i>But as a matter of fact, I was.</i>

37:28.440 --> 37:29.920
<i>Okay, that's it. Tim, goodbye.</i>

37:30.160 --> 37:32.240
<i>- Jill, goodbye. Carol, goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

37:32.320 --> 37:36.040
<i>And from me, arrivederci. Bye-bye.</i>

37:44.600 --> 37:46.360
Thanks. See you.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.200
<i>Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the game of Countdown.</i>

38:04.280 --> 38:07.320
<i>You remember yesterday, Carol,
I revealed to a grateful nation...</i>

38:07.400 --> 38:09.160
<i>...that our guest, Tom O'Connell-</i>

38:09.240 --> 38:12.080
<i>Yes.
He, like all of us, changes for each show.</i>

38:12.160 --> 38:13.480
<i>But he is such a-</i>

38:16.960 --> 38:18.480
<i>Is that right?
Yeah.</i>

38:18.560 --> 38:21.600
<i>Another term for Hosta, I think.</i>

38:21.920 --> 38:22.880
<i>Yes, well.</i>

38:22.960 --> 38:27.080
<i>Named after Heinrich Christian Funck,
who also invented disco dancing.</i>

38:29.920 --> 38:32.160
<i>Yes. I've got all his audios.</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:12.480
Mum, did you always know
I was going to be a vegetarian?

39:13.080 --> 39:14.280
Yeah, of course I did.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.840
I didn't decide on the spur of the moment
'cause we ran out of sausages.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.200
Did you ask me if I wanted to be a vegetarian?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.080
What, when you were born?

39:22.280 --> 39:24.400
I do the cooking and I don't want to cook meat.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.880
You have to eat what I eat.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.640
But you don't let me go to McDonald's, either.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.600
Is this premature teenage rebellion?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.440
I can't stop you from going to McDonald's.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.040
I'd just be disappointed if you did.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.000
Don't worry, Mum.
I won't go to McDonald's.

39:48.520 --> 39:52.760
<i>After a few visits, Will seemed to think
he had to ask me serious questions.</i>

39:52.840 --> 39:56.760
<i>But I knew he really wanted to watch
Warrior Princess.</i>

39:56.840 --> 39:58.640
So, how's it going at home then?

39:58.720 --> 40:01.280
- You mean my mum?
- Yeah.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.640
She's all right, thanks.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.120
I mean, you know, she's...

40:10.720 --> 40:14.320
Yeah, I know. No, nothing like that.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.040
Does it still bother you, then?

40:21.080 --> 40:22.480
Does it bother me?

40:24.280 --> 40:25.800
Are you decent?

40:30.160 --> 40:31.760
<i>Every single day.</i>

40:31.960 --> 40:34.320
<i>That's why I come here, instead of going home.</i>

40:34.480 --> 40:37.040
A bit. When I think about it.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.160
Fucking hell.

40:44.360 --> 40:48.000
<i>I don't know why he swore like that,
but it made me feel better.</i>

40:48.920 --> 40:52.320
<i>It made me feel like I wasn't being pathetic
to get so scared.</i>

40:55.680 --> 40:58.520
<i>I wouldn't make the mistake of asking
about Fiona again.</i>

40:58.600 --> 41:00.320
<i>Marcus was clearly screwed up about it...</i>

41:00.400 --> 41:04.160
<i>...and unfortunately I couldn't think
of anything to say that'd be of any value.</i>

41:04.240 --> 41:06.760
<i>Next time he could talk to Suzie,
or a counselor...</i>

41:06.880 --> 41:09.840
<i>...or anybody capable
of something more than an obscenity.</i>

41:09.920 --> 41:12.040
Shit! It can't be.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.240
November-the-sodding-19.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.360
Six weeks before Christmas
and already they were playing the bloody thing.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.080
Dad?

41:30.560 --> 41:32.440
What was your dad like?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.640
A bit sad, really.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.640
You know, he wrote one crap song
that turned out to be a massive hit...

41:38.720 --> 41:42.360
...and then spent the rest of his life
trying to write a better one.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.320
Do you ever want to write songs like him?

41:44.400 --> 41:46.520
Is that what the guitar's for?

41:47.960 --> 41:49.000
No.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.720
So, that's just there to look cool.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.240
Yeah.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.000
I like Santa's Super Sleigh.

42:16.320 --> 42:19.280
Madonna! Come here!
We've got something.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.840
He's getting away, look!
Hurry up!

42:22.000 --> 42:25.400
<i>On Pet Rescue today,
the clever stoat keeps everyone...</i>

42:25.480 --> 42:27.680
<i>...on their toes in Somerset.</i>

42:52.400 --> 42:53.720
Hey!

42:53.920 --> 42:55.800
What are you doing?
Who are you?

42:55.880 --> 42:57.000
Who am I?

42:57.160 --> 43:01.120
Bugger off, that's who I am! Go on, piss off!

43:03.040 --> 43:04.520
Who were they, then?

43:04.600 --> 43:05.880
Who?

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
What do you mean, "Who?"

43:07.040 --> 43:09.800
The ones
trying to embed sweets into your skull.

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
Oh, them.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.760
They're just a couple of older kids.
They started following me after school.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.440
Does this happen often?

43:16.520 --> 43:19.120
They never chucked sweets before,
they just thought of that.

43:19.200 --> 43:22.600
I'm not talking about the sweets.
The kids trying to kill you.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.920
Yeah, they give me a hard time.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.480
You know, about my hair,
and my clothes and singing and stuff.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.000
And what? And singing?

43:31.360 --> 43:34.080
Sometimes I sing out loud without noticing.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.400
That's not a brilliant idea, is it?

43:36.480 --> 43:40.360
I said I did it without noticing, didn't I?
It just happens!

43:40.720 --> 43:44.320
I'm not going to do it on purpose, am I?
I'm not stupid, you know.

43:44.440 --> 43:48.440
My advice is to keep out of people's way.
Try to make yourself invisible.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.880
How can I be invisible?

43:49.960 --> 43:52.160
One machine in your kitchen
is an invisible machine?

43:52.240 --> 43:53.880
I don't think so.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.760
I just try not to think of it, that's all.

43:59.920 --> 44:03.240
It happens, and I wish it didn't,
but that's life, isn't it?

44:05.360 --> 44:07.800
There's nothing I can do about it.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.120
No.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.920
There is something we can do about it, Marcus.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.160
You're coming with me.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.680
<i>I was worried he was going to take me
to the headmistress' office.</i>

44:24.160 --> 44:26.000
<i>But instead he took me shopping.</i>

44:26.080 --> 44:27.240
I don't get it.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.920
We're starting with your feet.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.840
I can't make you invisible,
but I can make you blend in with the crowd.

44:33.640 --> 44:36.960
I don't know how to tie them.
They've got these funny strappy things.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.240
It's called Velcro.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.640
It's a revolutionary new technology.

44:43.240 --> 44:46.240
For Christ's sake. It's not hard.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.360
All right, wait a minute, it is a bit hard.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.280
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

44:54.640 --> 44:57.320
Pretty trendy, your old man, isn't he?

45:00.680 --> 45:02.640
There. You think you look cool, don't you?

45:02.720 --> 45:03.840
Don't know.

45:04.040 --> 45:07.720
- Do you think I look cool?
- Yeah, Marcus.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.440
- I think you look cool.
- Yeah.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.080
That's it, you got the walk. That's really cool.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.640
Brilliant. High five. Yeah.

45:22.040 --> 45:25.080
<i>I was suddenly hit by an extraordinary
rush of well-being.</i>

45:25.160 --> 45:27.880
<i>So this is what people meant by a natural high.</i>

45:27.960 --> 45:30.120
<i>And it only cost £60.</i>

45:30.200 --> 45:33.080
<i>I had made an unhappy boy temporarily happy.</i>

45:33.240 --> 45:35.320
<i>And there wasn't anything in it for me at all.</i>

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
<i>I didn't even want to shag his mum.</i>

45:48.200 --> 45:50.840
Marcus! What happened to your shoes?

45:51.080 --> 45:52.680
They stole them.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.280
Why would anyone want to steal your shoes?

46:04.360 --> 46:06.520
<i>I could see I had to tell the truth.</i>

46:06.600 --> 46:09.480
<i>The problem was,
the truth would lead to a lot more questions.</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:11.080
They were nice ones.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.440
They were just ordinary brown lace-ups.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.560
No, they weren't. They were cool new trainers.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.960
Where did you get cool new trainers?

46:19.040 --> 46:20.720
<i>She had loads more questions.</i>

46:20.800 --> 46:22.520
Will bought them for me.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.080
Will?

46:26.240 --> 46:28.760
- The guy who took us to lunch?
- Yeah.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.000
He's sort of become my friend.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.160
He's sort of become your friend?

46:33.240 --> 46:35.640
<i>She kept repeating
the last thing I said.</i>

46:35.720 --> 46:37.320
<i>Except she shouted it.</i>

46:37.600 --> 46:39.800
I go round to his place after school.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.440
You go round to his place after school!

46:42.520 --> 46:46.160
- You see, he doesn't really have a kid.
- He doesn't really have a kid?

46:46.240 --> 46:48.280
Can I play computer games now?

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
Where does he live?

46:49.640 --> 46:52.320
He's not there at the moment.
He's out to dinner.

46:54.320 --> 46:57.200
<i>Christine had asked me to dinner
for a pep talk.</i>

46:57.320 --> 47:00.560
<i>You will end up childless and alone.</i>

47:00.640 --> 47:02.600
<i>Both fingers crossed, yeah.</i>

47:04.440 --> 47:05.880
You must have a lot of courage.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.880
Why is that, Christine?

47:08.520 --> 47:11.840
Most people need something in their lives
to keep them afloat...

47:11.960 --> 47:14.800
...and you have absolutely nothing.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.400
Doesn't that scare you?

47:18.080 --> 47:19.960
Do you know what you want?

47:21.480 --> 47:23.000
Yes, I do. I'll have the steak-

47:23.080 --> 47:26.480
What the hell are these little
after-school tea parties about?

47:26.960 --> 47:28.840
Hi. Sorry? What did you say?

47:28.920 --> 47:32.880
I was just wondering why a single,
childless man would want to hang out...

47:32.960 --> 47:35.320
...with a 12-year-old boy every day?

47:35.480 --> 47:38.360
You didn't tell your mum
that you've been coming round?

47:38.480 --> 47:40.760
- I think I forgot.
- Tell me what?

47:41.400 --> 47:43.120
What are you doing with my son?

47:43.280 --> 47:45.480
Wait a minute. What are you suggesting here?

47:45.560 --> 47:47.720
- I'm not suggesting anything.
- I think you are.

47:47.800 --> 47:51.240
You were suggesting that
I've been interfering with your son.

47:51.320 --> 47:55.600
I'm simply asking you
why you entertain 12-year-olds in your flat.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.080
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

47:58.960 --> 48:01.840
What do you have to say for yourself?

48:02.440 --> 48:03.560
Well?

48:03.640 --> 48:05.320
Don't "well" me!

48:05.400 --> 48:06.960
Don't "well" me about this!

48:07.040 --> 48:09.640
He comes over uninvited every night!
Do you know why?

48:09.720 --> 48:13.400
He's having the shit bullied out of him at school!
And you haven't got a clue.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.480
You send him out like a lamb to the slaughter!

48:15.560 --> 48:19.000
He's been taken to pieces every day of the week,
you daft, fucking hippie!

48:19.080 --> 48:21.680
I think you're being a bit melodramatic.
Marcus is fine.

48:21.760 --> 48:25.720
<i>Strange. Will had it right, Mum didn't.
It should be the other way around.</i>

48:25.800 --> 48:27.640
You haven't had much contact with kids.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.360
I used to be a bloody kid!
I went to a bloody school.

48:30.440 --> 48:33.760
I know when kids can't settle down
and when kids are miserable!

48:33.840 --> 48:37.320
Look at him, for Christ's sake!
Don't accuse me of being melodramatic.

48:37.400 --> 48:40.760
- This coming from a woman who tried to-
- Cowabunga!

48:41.920 --> 48:44.520
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.240
I just felt like a shout.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.520
Jesus, what a family.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.000
Will, you're disturbing the other customers.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.600
It's fine. I'm sorry. I'm done.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.160
- Okay, so, you're not...
- What?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.040
No, I'm not! No, I'm not.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.280
Listen, don't worry about it.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.480
I won't open the door to Marcus again, okay?

49:02.560 --> 49:04.840
I'll be glad to be rid of the pair of you, frankly.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.600
Go on. Bugger off.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.040
Sorry.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.440
So that's it, is it?

49:20.520 --> 49:23.200
You're just out of his life, like that.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.160
Excuse me?

49:24.240 --> 49:26.400
Let's say you're right and I'm wrong.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.320
Let's say there's this whole world...

49:28.400 --> 49:31.760
...that I don't understand,
and somehow, miraculously, you do.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.880
What are you going to do about it?

49:33.960 --> 49:36.800
I'm not going to do anything.
He's none of my business.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.480
- You're a selfish bastard.
- That's what I tell him.

49:39.560 --> 49:43.040
- He always puts himself first.
- But I'm on my own.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.360
It's just me.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.080
I'm not putting myself first.
There's nobody else.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.120
Yes, there is!

49:48.280 --> 49:50.560
There's Marcus. You're involved now.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.760
He keeps coming around your bloody house.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.200
You've come into his life for a reason.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.840
You can't just shut him out.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.920
You can't shut life out. "No man is an island. "

50:00.000 --> 50:01.880
- She's right, you know.
- Yeah, she is.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.400
No, she's not! She's wrong!

50:03.480 --> 50:05.320
Some men are islands. I'm a bloody island!

50:05.400 --> 50:06.760
I'm bloody Ibiza!

50:08.120 --> 50:10.080
What are you talking about?

50:10.800 --> 50:13.120
Do you want to come over for Christmas?

50:15.640 --> 50:18.760
<i>No, Marcus, I do not want
to come over for bloody Christmas.</i>

50:18.960 --> 50:23.000
<i>I do not want to spend Christmas
with Miss Granola Suicide and her spawn.</i>

50:24.600 --> 50:26.760
<i>I'd always thought
what you did with Christmas...</i>

50:26.840 --> 50:30.040
<i>...was sort of a statement about
where you stood in life.</i>

50:30.560 --> 50:33.760
<i>I was going to spend this Christmas
the way I usually did.</i>

50:34.000 --> 50:36.960
<i>Watching videos and getting drunk and stoned.</i>

50:49.240 --> 50:52.360
Before you came,
I was all alone.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.600
It is bad to be alone.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.960
Alone, bad.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.600
Friend, good.

51:01.120 --> 51:04.320
Friend, goodl

51:06.040 --> 51:07.520
Now come here.

51:07.960 --> 51:10.960
<i>The good news was it wasn't
just me and Fiona and Marcus.</i>

51:11.040 --> 51:13.680
<i>The bad news was, well...</i>

51:13.880 --> 51:17.520
So, you're Marcus' dad.

51:17.960 --> 51:23.280
Yeah, I guess so.
And this is my girlfriend, Lindsey.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.360
And Lindsey's mum.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.840
Hi there.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.080
- Thanks, Dad.
- That's okay.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.120
I had to hand it to the kid.

51:46.200 --> 51:49.480
He could be enthusiastic
about some truly crap present.

51:49.960 --> 51:52.400
Wow, a tambourine! Thanks, Mum.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.400
Isn't that cool, Will?

51:54.480 --> 51:57.000
Yeah, that'll come in handy.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.120
I saw it and I thought, "This'll be perfect. "

51:59.200 --> 52:03.880
Maybe you can perform at that school concert.
Get a pop group together. Make some friends.

52:04.440 --> 52:05.800
Maybe, Mum.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.560
When you sing,
it brings sunshine and happiness into my heart.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.040
Thanks, Mum.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.360
This one's from me.

52:28.680 --> 52:31.440
Brilliant! What is it?

52:31.720 --> 52:33.120
It's a CD, Marcus.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.240
By Mystikal. They're cool. You'll like them.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.480
And what kind of music is Mystikal?

52:38.760 --> 52:41.560
It's sort of world music.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.760
"Shake Ya Ass."

52:44.160 --> 52:45.880
Slash rap type thing.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.560
Shake Ya Ass?

52:48.640 --> 52:49.920
Is he Moroccan?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.880
I'm afraid we haven't got a CD player.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.920
It's great anyway.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.280
I know you haven't got a CD player,
so, I got you one of them as well.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.440
What a lucky boy.

53:00.680 --> 53:01.960
Look, Mum.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.000
- Open yours, Will.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

53:09.800 --> 53:12.480
- Marcus, is this a joke?
- Yeah.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.280
It's not bad.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.520
Hi. Sorry, I'm dead late!

53:18.760 --> 53:20.680
- Have I missed anything?
- No, come on in.

53:20.760 --> 53:23.240
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

53:23.960 --> 53:25.360
Hey!

53:26.680 --> 53:28.320
Long time no see.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.000
Where's Megan?

53:31.080 --> 53:35.320
At her dad's. Where's Ned?
At his mum's for Christmas?

53:42.120 --> 53:43.120
Yeah.

53:43.240 --> 53:46.360
No. I should probably go, shouldn't I?

53:46.760 --> 53:50.440
You could go pose as Santa,
try and shag some carol singers.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.400
Are you a professional Santa?

53:52.480 --> 53:53.680
How lovely!

53:53.760 --> 53:56.120
Right. That's it. I'm off.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.920
Thank you very much. It was great.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.560
Suzie has every right to express her anger.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.200
Yes, and she's expressed it.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.480
Now I have a right to bugger off.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.560
Thanks a lot. 'Bye.

54:06.640 --> 54:07.760
Wait!

54:08.280 --> 54:10.000
He's my friend. I invited him.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.000
I should be able to tell him when to go home.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.360
I haven't told Will to go, Marcus.

54:14.440 --> 54:17.560
Suzie's angry and has every right to be,
and she's telling him so.

54:17.640 --> 54:18.720
She's right, Marcus.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.560
Just leave it, okay?

54:21.200 --> 54:23.480
All he did was make up a kid for a couple weeks.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.000
God, that's nothing. So what? Who cares?

54:26.080 --> 54:28.040
Kids at school do worse than that every day!

54:28.120 --> 54:30.920
The point is, Marcus,
Will left school a long time ago.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.160
He should've grown out
of making people up by now.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.480
- That's for sure.
- It's not fair to gang up on him.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.200
He's been better behaved since then.

54:37.360 --> 54:42.400
He bought me trainers, he lets me go round
to his house and he knows what kids need.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.400
What?
Expensive footwear and obscene music?

54:45.480 --> 54:48.440
If there's something you really need
then we can talk about it.

54:48.520 --> 54:52.000
No, we can't. It's not a discussion,
it's an argument, and you always win.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.920
- Why not just tell me what to do?
- I want you to think for yourself!

54:55.000 --> 54:57.440
I'm thinking for myself! And I want Will to stay!

54:57.520 --> 54:59.920
He's not the only one
who ever did anything wrong!

55:00.000 --> 55:02.120
Remember how we met? Remember why?
Because you-

55:02.200 --> 55:06.640
Because you threw a loaf of bread
at a duck's head and killed it, basically.

55:10.920 --> 55:13.120
Excuse me? What's this about a duck?

55:13.200 --> 55:15.560
Are we having duck? Delicious!

55:18.080 --> 55:20.040
<i>Of course we were not having duck.</i>

55:20.120 --> 55:22.960
<i>Instead we had nut loaf with parsnip gravy.</i>

55:24.680 --> 55:27.360
<i>As I sat there, I had a strange feeling.</i>

55:28.080 --> 55:29.880
<i>I was enjoying myself.</i>

55:30.560 --> 55:33.040
<i>I'd never really enjoyed Christmas before.</i>

55:33.200 --> 55:35.400
<i>My mother used to make me sing
Santa's Super Sleigh...</i>

55:35.480 --> 55:37.840
<i>...in front of my inebriated uncles and aunts...</i>

55:37.960 --> 55:40.240
<i>...just to get at my dad, I think.</i>

55:40.600 --> 55:44.120
<i>But Christmas at Marcus',
I'm ashamed to say it, gave me...</i>

55:44.200 --> 55:45.880
<i>...a warm, fuzzy feeling.</i>

55:46.320 --> 55:49.680
<i>I held that feeling responsible
for the strange events that followed.</i>

55:53.440 --> 55:56.000
<i>First of all, Marcus got a crush on a girl.</i>

55:56.080 --> 55:58.080
Hello.
Piss off.

55:59.920 --> 56:03.760
<i>And then, even stranger, so did I.</i>

56:04.840 --> 56:06.360
<i>It was all Marcus' fault, really...</i>

56:06.440 --> 56:10.560
<i>...because once you open your door
to one person, anyone can come in.</i>

56:11.280 --> 56:13.320
<i>On New Year's Eve, I met Rachel.</i>

56:13.400 --> 56:16.000
<i>She was interesting, smart and attractive.</i>

56:16.120 --> 56:19.560
<i>And for about five minutes,
I had her convinced that I was, too.</i>

56:19.640 --> 56:21.680
...things like political events.

56:21.800 --> 56:22.600
Okay.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.080
You in television?

56:24.400 --> 56:27.640
Am I in television? No.

56:27.720 --> 56:29.800
- Everyone else is in television.
- Yeah.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.000
I watch television.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.040
Right, right.
So you're more in front of it than in it.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.000
- In it, yeah.
- Yes, I get it, yeah.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.280
<i>It was torture.</i>

56:37.400 --> 56:41.600
<i>For five minutes I realized what life would be like
if I were, in any way, interesting.</i>

56:41.680 --> 56:45.080
<i>If I had anything to say for myself,
if I did anything.</i>

56:45.200 --> 56:46.840
<i>But I didn't do anything.</i>

56:47.480 --> 56:51.360
<i>And in about 30 seconds she'd know
and she'd be gone like a shot.</i>

56:51.560 --> 56:53.920
So what do you do?

56:56.080 --> 56:59.440
I'm sort of taking a bit of time off at the moment.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.840
- Sounds good, yeah.
- Yeah.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.360
Time off from what?

57:04.880 --> 57:10.880
To be absolutely honest,
time off from time off, in fact.

57:11.040 --> 57:15.720
The interesting thing about me is
I don't actually do anything.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.640
- You don't do anything?
- Actually, no.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.480
- Nothing.
- Nope.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.160
Wow.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.560
That's...

57:32.080 --> 57:33.600
Now, Rachel, darling.

57:34.800 --> 57:37.840
East Coast or West Coast rap?

57:37.960 --> 57:39.160
I have absolutely no...

57:39.240 --> 57:43.280
<i>There. She was gone.
There was no more to say.</i>

57:44.160 --> 57:46.400
All rap music sounds exactly the same to me.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.400
Or was there?

57:47.480 --> 57:51.120
I tell you what. I know a 12-year-old
who'd kill you for saying that.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.880
- Really?
- Yes.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.520
- So do I, come to that.
- Yeah?

57:55.880 --> 57:58.480
- Yeah. What's yours called?
- Mine?

58:00.080 --> 58:03.440
He's called Marcus.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.880
Mine's Ali. Alistair.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.920
<i>And there it was.</i>

58:09.000 --> 58:11.920
<i>It wasn't a lie.
It was 100 percent her assumption.</i>

58:12.440 --> 58:14.600
<i>Well, 50 percent, at the very least.</i>

58:17.440 --> 58:21.080
<i>I was in fantasyland again.
But this time it was different.</i>

58:21.400 --> 58:26.360
<i>SPAT was for fun. This was serious.
I acted in self-defense.</i>

58:34.400 --> 58:36.400
<i>We arranged to get our lads together.</i>

58:36.520 --> 58:39.360
<i>Which means
we arranged for us to get together.</i>

58:39.600 --> 58:42.080
<i>Single parents, alone together.</i>

58:43.440 --> 58:45.520
Happy New Year!

58:46.560 --> 58:48.400
<i>I was in deep trouble.</i>

58:49.920 --> 58:52.840
<i>And there was only one person
who could help me out.</i>

59:02.360 --> 59:06.880
"Shake ya ass, but watch ya self
Shake ya ass, show me what you workin' with

59:07.040 --> 59:08.800
"Shake ya ass, watch ya self

59:10.840 --> 59:14.680
- "Show me what you workin' with"
- What did you just say to me?

59:15.800 --> 59:18.760
You heard me, squitty little shitty
snot-nosed bastard!

59:18.840 --> 59:19.880
Sorry.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.360
I was singing along to this song by Mystikal.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.840
It's a rap.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.400
You like rap?

59:25.600 --> 59:26.440
A little.

59:26.520 --> 59:29.640
It's by black people, mostly.
They're angry most of the time.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.080
But sometimes they just want to have sex.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.360
You taking a piss?

59:34.440 --> 59:36.120
'Cause if you are, you'll get a slap.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.640
I'm not taking a piss.

59:37.720 --> 59:40.400
I don't even know how to take a piss.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.840
- What's your name?
- Marcus.

59:45.240 --> 59:46.560
I'm Ellie.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.440
Hi, Ellie. Nice to meet you.

59:48.520 --> 59:52.840
Not so fast. I'm not ready for physical contact.
Next thing you know, we'll be having sex.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.800
And where will that get us?

59:54.960 --> 59:58.000
And stop telling strangers to shake their ass.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.720
Okay, Ellie. See you!

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.520
Hello, mate.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.040
Listen, I need your help.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.520
Why did you tell this lady I was your son?

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.800
No, I didn't tell her.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.720
I told you,
she just got the wrong end of the stick.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.080
So just tell her.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160
- No. Can't do that.
- Why not?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.400
We're really going around in circles here.
Just accept the facts, okay?

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.040
You're my son.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.000
I'll tell her, if you like. I don't mind.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.360
That's very kind of you, Marcus, but no.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.640
- Why not?
- For Christ's sake!

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.240
She's got a rare disease
and if she believes something that's not right...

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.560
...then hears the truth, her brain will boil
in her head and she'll die, okay?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.920
That's a load of shit.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.320
I'm really interested in this woman.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.760
What do you mean, interested?

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.920
What's so interesting about her?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.720
Okay, Marcus, here.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.800
Here's my last scrap of dignity. Enjoy it.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.480
I want to go out with her. Okay?

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.880
I'd like her to be my girlfriend. There, I said it.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.480
Brilliant! Why didn't you just say that?

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.720
I don't know.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.120
I was embarrassed or something,
'cause this is a bit new for me.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.680
I just met her, her name's Rachel.
She's sort of-

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.480
There's this girl at school. Ellie.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.360
I kind of want her to be my girlfriend.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.160
I'm not exactly sure.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.920
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.840
What's the difference between
a girl who's your friend and a girlfriend?

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.280
Well, I don't know.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.960
Do you want to touch her?

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.240
Is that so important?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.920
Yeah, you've heard about sex, right?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.560
It is kind of a big deal.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.600
I know. I'm not stupid.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.600
I just can't believe there's nothing more to it.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.680
I mean, like, I want to be with her more.
I want to be with her all the time.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.520
And I want to tell her things
I don't even tell you or Mum.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.000
And I don't want her to have another boyfriend.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.040
If I could have all those things...

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.320
...I wouldn't really mind if I touched her or not.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.080
Well, you'll learn, Marcus.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.520
You won't feel like that forever.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.200
Okay, how do I look?

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.040
Good. How do I look?

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.040
Just be as normal as you can, okay?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.640
Good advice for Marcus.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.360
I wish I could have followed it.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.120
I'm sorry it's such a mess.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.160
That's where I work.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.360
My mouth was dry
and my palms sweating.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.840
I didn't know what the hell was happening to me.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.600
...manage to tidy up. Ali?

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.480
All I could do was stand there,
grinning like an idiot.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.320
- Should we just go upstairs?
- Sure. Okay.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.040
Ali.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.360
Marcus.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.280
Marcus.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080
Ali.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.840
You're in my year at school.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.760
Really? Yeah, I think I've seen you around.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.680
Great!

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.920
Then you guys'll have a lot to talk about.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.760
Will, this is Ali.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.600
Ali, this is Will.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.280
- All right.
- All right.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.000
Do you guys want to hang up here for a while?

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960
- Yeah, sounds good, right?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.840
For a moment, I loved him.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.320
Really loved him.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.560
You can show him
your new computer games.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.480
Good. Okay, catch you later.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.520
Let's leave them to it.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.160
If your dad goes out with my mum,
then you're dead.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.640
Really dead.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.120
- Don't worry. He's all right.
- I don't care if he's all right!

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.040
I don't want him going out with my mum!

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.720
I don't want to see him
or you around here ever again, okay?

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.600
I'm not really sure it's up to me.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.640
Well, it better be! Or you're going to die.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.480
<i>I was getting the feeling
that maybe this kid Ali was a serial killer.</i>

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.520
Can I have a go on your computer?
What games you got?

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.320
Are you listening to me?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.880
Yeah, it's just that I can't really
do much at the moment, can I?

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.040
I mean, Will, that's my dad...

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.920
...he likes your mum,
and I think she's keen on him.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.560
She's not keen on him!

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.480
She's only keen on me!

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.200
<i>One amazing thing about Rachel...</i>

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.920
<i>...was that I wanted to kiss her every time
she said something interesting.</i>

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.040
<i>Which was all the time.</i>

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.080
<i>It was sexy. It was weird.</i>

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.520
I use Bristol boards, India ink and...

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.080
Am I boring you?

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.720
No, no. No.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.000
- Why?
- Nothing.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.840
It's just you looked like Marcus just then.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.680
Did I?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.080
I think it's sweet how much
he seems to take after you...

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.280
...and the way he dresses like you, as well.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.360
I don't think I dress like Marcus, really.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Marcus?

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.480
Wait! Hang on. Hang on.
Come on, we're going back.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.000
- He's off his head.
- No, he's not.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.160
He said he'd cut me up into little pieces
and hide me under the floorboards.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.080
- He did?
- No.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.960
But I'm sure he's capable of it.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.000
It'll be different. You'll like it, I promise.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.160
Marcus, Ali has something to say to you.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.840
Doesn't he?

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.600
Sorry, Marcus.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.080
I didn't mean to say those things.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.920
It's okay, Ali.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.120
Ali finds all this very difficult.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Yeah, so does Marcus.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.080
Don't you, mate?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.640
You know, I mean, divorced parents...

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.840
...and not knowing
how to feel about new people.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.880
Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely the way I feel.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.840
Ali didn't get along
with the last bloke I went out with.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.080
- He was a liar!
- All right, darling.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.040
He wasn't 100 percent good news.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.240
- I'm not saying that you and I are.
- That's okay.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.800
He fancies you. He told me.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.320
- Thanks a lot, mate.
- Oh, dear.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.840
Cheers, mate.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.640
Don't look so worried, sweetheart.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.280
Ellie!

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.760
- Marcus? What, are you stalking me?
- No.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.920
Too bad. Made me feel like a celebrity.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.120
Yeah, but I didn't know that then, did I, sexy?

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.960
All I'm saying is, you know, watch out.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.920
It just looks a bit more like owner and pet
than boyfriend and girlfriend.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.720
At least I'm honest.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880
What does that mean?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.200
It's just that you and Rachel...

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.840
What? What does that mean?

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.240
I don't know,
I think there's a problem with you and Rachel.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.000
I mean, like, you want to be with her
but she thinks you have a son.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200
And you don't.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.240
If you're going to be with someone...

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.840
...shouldn't you tell them things like that?

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600
No.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.320
I mean, you know, like the truth.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.560
What's wrong with you?

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.240
<i>But later that night,
when I was on my own...</i>

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.520
<i>...I remembered the deal
Marcus was prepared to strike.</i>

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.960
<i>Yes, I wanted to touch Rachel.</i>

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.320
<i>But at this moment, if I had the choice...</i>

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.960
<i>...I'd settle for the less and the more
that Marcus wanted.</i>

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.840
<i>Jesus, was I turning into Marcus?</i>

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.320
<i>Would he be buying me shoes soon?</i>

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.640
<i>I took his advice and told Rachel the truth.</i>

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640
<i>Or very nearly the truth.</i>

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.440
<i>That I wasn't Marcus' natural father.</i>

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.240
And that is not natural seaweed.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.120
<i>The problem was, once I told the truth,
I knew there'd be more questions.</i>

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.720
I don't get it. If you're not his natural father...

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.800
...and you don't live with him,
then how is he your son?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.280
Yeah, I see.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.720
It must look very confusing from the outside.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.120
Tell me how it is on the inside.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.320
It's just one of those long, boring stories.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.720
Look, do you want to move on to wine?

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.720
You want some Chinese rice wine, miss?

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.760
You would like to try,
I suspect, the Panang Paneng.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:19.840
Yeah?

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.520
No.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.439
Tell me about your relationship with Ali.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.080
- Is that as complicated as mine and Marcus'?
- No.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.720
I slept with his father,
and then nine months later I gave birth.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.800
Pretty straight forward.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.200
Yeah. I envy you that.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:41.520
I'm really sorry to harp on about this
but I haven't got it all worked out yet.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.800
You are Marcus' stepfather,
but you don't live with him or with his mother.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.680
No, you see, wait.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.319
I never said he was my son.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.439
Did I?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.640
The words "I have a son called Marcus,"
never escaped my lips.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.880
It's what you chose to believe.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.680
Yeah. Right.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.120
It's me that's the fantasist.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.920
I wanted to believe that you had a son,
so I let my imagination run riot.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.080
Obviously I played a part, I can see that.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.800
No! Not at all.
I met you and I thought, "Cute guy.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.040
"God, if only he had a son.
A geeky, teenage kid, if possible. "

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.880
Then you turned up at my house
with Marcus, and bingo!

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.319
Now I made this crazy link
'cause of some deep psychological need in me.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.760
You shouldn't beat yourself up about it.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.040
It could have happened to anyone.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:50.160
The first time I met you
I thought you were a bit blank.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.760
But then you changed my mind.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.000
Maybe I was right.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.280
- Rachel, listen.
- Yes?

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.520
I'm sorry, you're right.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.240
I am a blank.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.600
I'm really nothing.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.360
I don't know what the hell I was thinking of,
I'm sorry.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.640
'Bye, Ellie.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.360
Marcus! My man!

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.440
Bye, Marcus!

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.120
See you, Marcus!

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.680
Mum?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.720
So, if z = 17, does x > 2?

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.400
Marcus?

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.000
<i>I didn't know what the answer was.</i>

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.160
<i>I didn't know what "x" equaled.</i>

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.480
<i>And I didn't know how to help my mum.</i>

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.720
<i>And then I realized.</i>

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.520
<i>There was something she said
I could do for her.</i>

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.200
- I'm thinking of singing at the school concert.
- You? At the rock concert?

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.200
I don't think that would be
a very good idea, Marcus.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.600
Will you accompany me?

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.560
All I've got is a tambourine.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.360
No, I'm sorry. It's suicide.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.240
I mean, they'll crucify you.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.760
Mum's at it again.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.760
- At what? Sorry.
- What do you mean, what?

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.960
The crying.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.480
She sits in the house all day, crying.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.960
She does it in the mornings, too.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.240
It's as bad now as it was
before the Dead Duck Day.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.480
Marcus, I'm sorry, mate...

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.480
...I'm a bit busy at the moment.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.480
You're busy? Doing what?

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.160
- Didn't you hear me?
- I heard you.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.480
- What do you want me to do about it?
- I don't know.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.040
- You could talk to her.
- Yeah? And what would I say?

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.200
- I don't know!
- Why would she listen to me?

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.880
Who am I to her?

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.280
- I'm nobody.
- You're not nobody.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.600
- You're-
- Who? Who do you think I am?

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.000
Who do you think you are?

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.880
You come here uninvited,
you disrupt my life, you screw things up.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.880
What do you want from me?
This isn't my problem.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.680
I'm not your family, mate. I'm not.
I'm not your uncle.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.960
I'm not your big brother.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.360
We've established pretty firmly
that I'm not your father, either, am I?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.280
But...

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.640
I'll tell you what I am.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.000
I'm the guy who's really good at
choosing trainers or records, okay?

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.600
That's it. I can't help you with real things.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.040
I can't help you with anything
that means anything.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.960
You could try.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.320
You're right.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.440
You can't help me.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.880
How could you?

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.560
You're a stupid person who watches TV all day...

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.600
...and buys things.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.000
You don't give a shit about anybody,
and nobody gives a shit about you!

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.440
<i>Mum said my singing brought
sunshine and happiness...</i>

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.880
<i>...into her life.</i>

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.240
<i>So I'd do it, even if it meant mine was over.</i>

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.960
Look, Mum.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.880
<i>My life is made up of units of time.
Buying CDs: Two units.</i>

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.040
<i>Eating lunch: Three units.</i>

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.280
<i>Exercising: Two units.</i>

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.160
<i>All in all, I had a very full life.</i>

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.560
<i>It's just that it didn't mean anything.</i>

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.560
"Look who's coming
round the bend"

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.400
<i>The fact was there was only one thing
that meant something to me:</i>

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.560
<i>Marcus. He was the only thing
that meant something to me.</i>

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.920
<i>And Fiona was the only thing
that meant something to him.</i>

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.320
<i>And she was about to fall off the edge.</i>

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.400
Single parents alone together!

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.680
Single parents alone together!
All for one and one for all!

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.960
- Fiona!
- Will, we haven't seen you for a while.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.400
How's Ned?

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.120
Who? He's a load of crap. He doesn't exist.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.640
Yeah, I made him up.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.080
- You made him up?
- Yeah.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.600
- To meet women.
- You're sick.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.720
- Fiona, I've got to talk to you.
- Go ahead.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.520
No, you know, properly talk to you, privately.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.560
No, this is a circle of truth.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.080
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it in front of everybody.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:01.200
Okay. Please don't try
and commit suicide again.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.880
I can't believe you just said that.
That is my private experience.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.600
Yeah, well, that's the thing, isn't it? It's not.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.200
Marcus is worried about you.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.280
I'm worried because he's worried about you.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.360
Will, I don't have plans to commit suicide.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.400
You don't?

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.080
Not at the moment, no.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.120
Great. Great!

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.240
Good.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.080
You know I'm not attracted to you, right?

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.960
What are you on about?
No. What are you, nuts?

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.800
Right. Wrong word completely.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.840
But that's something that
we should, you know, talk about a bit.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.160
The crying in the morning thing, the depression.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.480
Let's get that fixed.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.520
That's what men think, isn't it?
What?

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.040
That unless you've got the answer,
unless you can say:

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.080
"I know a bloke in the Essex Road who
can fix that," then there's no point bothering.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.120
No.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.240
Well, yeah, okay. I would.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.240
I'd love to know the name of the bloke
in the Essex Road...

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.480
...because I've got a feeling I'd be useless.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.520
Will, you're not useless.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.040
You're here. And that matters.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.160
Right.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.520
- Now, can we... Do you mind?
- What?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.160
- Marcus is singing at the school concert.
- Marcus is singing?

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.640
- Yeah, singing.
- At school?

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.280
It's a pop concert. He's so excited.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.440
- I want to get there on time.
- Wait, wait. What's he singing?

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.760
"Killing me softly with his song

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.480
"Telling my whole life"

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.240
- What time does this thing start?
- What have you got against Marcus singing?

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.600
You know the dream where you're at school
without your trousers on and everyone laughs?

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.760
- What's the connection?
- That will be Marcus, but for real.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.440
If he sings that song in front of those kids...

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.720
...you can just write him off until university.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.880
If he reaches university,
'cause he's going to get torn to shreds.

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.480
You cannot stop someone
from expressing themselves.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.280
He's not expressing himself!
He's expressing you, okay?

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.720
Oh, God.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.200
What? Jesus Christ.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.000
You're right. Will, am I a bad mother?

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.760
No, you're not a bad mother.
You're just a barking lunatic.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.560
No, I am. I am a bad mother.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.880
I've let things slide
and I haven't been noticing properly.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.360
He's a special, very special boy.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.840
And he's got a special soul, and I've wounded it!

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.680
Please, just shut up. You're wounding my soul.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.960
Okay, you park it.
What?

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.000
Hi.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.560
What are you doing here?

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.400
That's Ali up there.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.680
He's talented.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:27.360
Now that was the Def Penalty Kru
with Murder Fo' Life.

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.960
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer...

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.280
...singing Roberta Flack's beloved
Killing Me Softly.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.240
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove
on the recorder.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.040
Marcus, I can't do this.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.760
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said...

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.360
I'm sorry. Here's your 5 back.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.120
Any moment now.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.280
Come on, Marcus, you wally!

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.400
Wait! Wait!

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.800
Excuse me. What is going on here?

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:21.440
Nothing. Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.080
What are you doing here?

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.440
I heard you were about to commit social suicide,
so I dropped by.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.160
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.040
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.880
Yeah, you can.
Just tell them: Artistic differences.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.440
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.720
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.760
Look, mate, nothing you do
can make your mum happy, all right?

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.800
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.360
- Get over here right now!
- Just bugger off, will you!

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.840
What I'm saying is, the important thing is
to make yourself feel happy.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.680
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.360
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.720
But that's just it.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.800
If other people can make you happy
then they can also make you unhappy.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.360
What, you think those people out there
are going to make you happy?

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.240
Hang on. Wait. Marcus, don't.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.520
Marcus! Bollocks.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.000
Come on, Britney!

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.240
Yeah, give us a song, then.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.800
This is for my mum.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.600
"I heard he sang a good song

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.040
"I heard he had a style

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.120
"And so I came to see him

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.800
"to listen for a while

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.320
"And there he was this young boy

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.680
"a stranger to my eyes"

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.560
You're rubbish, mate!

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.600
"Strumming my pain with his fingers

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.360
"Singing my life with his words

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.920
"Killing me softly with his song

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.720
"Killing me softly"

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.200
Who the hell is that?

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.080
"Telling my whole life with his words

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:07.160
"Killing me softly with his song

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.520
"I felt all flushed with fever

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.120
"embarrassed by the crowd

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.520
"I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.800
"I prayed that he would finish

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.080
"but he just kept right on

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.800
"Strumming my pain with his fingers

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.800
"Singing my life with his words

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.400
"Killing me softly"

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.920
Give it a rest.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.760
"Killing me softly with his song

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.120
"Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.720
"With his song

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.320
"He sang as if he knew me"

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.280
Will.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.720
"In all my dark despair"

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.800
We're finished.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.480
"And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there"

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.960
Will, come on.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.800
Will, we're finished.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.320
<i>So there I was,
killing them softly with my song.</i>

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.640
<i>Or rather, being killed.
And not that softly, either.</i>

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.360
<i>I was singing with my eyes closed.</i>

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.080
<i>Was I frightened?</i>

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.760
<i>I was petrified.</i>

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.040
<i>This was definitely not island living.</i>

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.760
"Killing me softly

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.400
"With his song"

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.400
Thank you, Finsbury.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.360
I'd like to introduce
one or two members of the band.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.120
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.240
And that's about it.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.560
Let's get off quick. Get off.

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.880
Marcus, thank you. For the song.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.400
You were terrific.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.920
- You think so?
- Yeah.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.760
As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.960
Okay.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.000
How about McDonald's?

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.240
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.720
Thanks, Mum, but it's okay.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.280
No, really. I want to go to McDonald's.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.000
You know, I'm not really hungry.

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:44.840
Come on. Are you telling me
you couldn't murder a Big Mac?

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.000
Mum!

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.480
Okay, another time.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240
Any time.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.360
I'll be around a while, you know.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.440
<i>By the following Christmas
things were back to normal.</i>

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.840
Before you came-

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.320
<i>Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.</i>

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.400
<i>But clearly, some men are part of island chains.</i>

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.680
<i>Below the surface of the ocean
they're actually connected.</i>

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.400
So you're going to marry my mum, then?

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.840
Don't know.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.000
Why?

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.800
You think she's up for it?

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.320
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.680
Yeah. But that was when she was depressed
and I was desperate.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.560
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.080
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.920
<i>I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.</i>

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.800
<i>Now there were loads of people.</i>

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.080
<i>And that was great. Mostly.</i>

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.360
Are you two lazy bastards
gonna get up and help, or what?

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.520
So how do you know Will?

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.360
We volunteered together
at Amnesty International a couple years ago.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.680
Yeah, that's right.
How is the Burmese situation, Tom? Better?

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.120
I mean good?

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.720
Yeah, and he called me up
out of the blue for Christmas lunch.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.280
So, here I am.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.640
Really?

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.840
So, listen, what's the deal
with you and Ellie now?

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:30.200
Is she your girlfriend?

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.040
Are you insane?

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.360
Where did you get those trainers?

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.080
- Why? What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.360
What?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.720
By the way,
I do think you and Rachel have a shot.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.800
- I mean, if you don't screw it up.
- Thank you.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.160
<i>I'd created a monster.</i>

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.360
<i>Or maybe he created me.</i>

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.840
<i>I don't know
what Will was so upset about.</i>

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.040
<i>All I meant was
I don't think couples are the future.</i>

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.120
<i>You need more than that. You need backup.</i>

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.800
<i>The way I saw it,
Will and I both had backup now.</i>

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.120
<i>It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:</i>

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.040
<i>"No man is an island."</i>
