00:10.385 --> 00:12.387
[theme music playing]

01:13.156 --> 01:15.241
Paladins, report status.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.869
-I'm offline!
-Me, too.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.748
Uh, guys, are you seeing this?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.584
[Lance] What are those things doing?

01:24.667 --> 01:26.377
[Pidge] That's how she's getting in.

01:26.669 --> 01:27.921
[Keith] What do you mean?

01:28.004 --> 01:32.258
Honerva! She's using those wings
to pierce the barriers between realities.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.718
It's her entry point!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.471
-[alarm blaring]
-Allura, come in. Are you there?

01:36.846 --> 01:38.807
[grunting] Shiro, I read you.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.559
Honerva combined her beast
with Lotor's Sincline.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.938
She has the comet ore and, with it,
the ability to traverse realities.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.481
I'm headed to my Lion now.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.733
[Sam] Our universe is collapsing,

01:48.817 --> 01:51.069
just like the day
we lost the Castle of Lions.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.781
Those wings are causing the very fabric
of our reality to disintegrate!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.157
[powering up]

01:56.241 --> 01:58.618
Then we're gonna stop that thing
before it breaks through.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.245
Yellow Lion's back!

02:00.578 --> 02:03.373
[Keith] Hunk, get your passengers
back to the Atlas.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.415
[Hunk] Copy that.

02:06.584 --> 02:11.714
[Honerva] My loyal warriors,
Merla proved disloyal.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.927
She turned her back on our mission
and the future of Altea.

02:16.386 --> 02:21.558
But you two have remained by my side,
and you will know true victory.

02:21.891 --> 02:25.228
The glory of Altea will be yours.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.402
[Pidge] Those Robeasts are headed our way!

02:32.485 --> 02:34.737
-[gasps] Just in time!
-[powering up]

02:34.821 --> 02:36.072
My Lion's responding!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.116
[roars]

02:38.575 --> 02:39.409
Mine, too.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.831
[Keith] Allura, do you copy?

02:44.914 --> 02:47.584
Can you get to your Lion?
We're gonna need Voltron.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.960
Hold on. I'm coming!

02:49.043 --> 02:51.004
In the meantime,
the Atlas has you covered.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.966
Wait, what about the collapsing universe?
We need to stop it!

02:55.300 --> 02:57.969
Coran, we're counting on you
to figure something out.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.847
What? Me?
I don't know anything about that!

03:00.930 --> 03:02.265
Then find someone who does!

03:02.765 --> 03:05.518
[Keith] We need to stop that weapon
before it breaks through realities.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.063
Paladins, do everything you can
to keep the Robeasts distracted.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.690
Let's give the Atlas a shot.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.653
Atlas crew,
prepare for transformation sequence.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.327
Nice shot!

03:28.875 --> 03:31.252
[Keith]
Guys, I'm going in to stop Honerva!

03:36.257 --> 03:37.175
Still.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.431
No!

03:49.312 --> 03:51.648
[Iverson] MFE pilots,
report to your hangars!

03:51.731 --> 03:53.149
Stand by for launch!

03:53.233 --> 03:56.027
I have an idea how we can stop
the collapsing of space-time.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.528
I'll grab Slav and Sam.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.698
You two get the Alteans
and meet me back here in ten doboshes!

04:03.493 --> 04:04.410
[Hunk] Now, Pidge!

04:09.207 --> 04:10.833
[grunts] Ah!

04:12.168 --> 04:13.336
Fall back!

04:26.224 --> 04:28.059
Allura, now's your chance!

04:33.523 --> 04:37.026
We can't get past them,
so we're gonna have to defeat them.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.611
Paladins, on me!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.655
[Keith] Form Voltron!

04:58.965 --> 04:59.799
[roars]

05:11.477 --> 05:14.230
[Allura] Remember, those weapons
can siphon our energy,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.274
so we need to avoid a direct hit.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.534
-Pidge, arm cannon!
-[grunts]

05:38.713 --> 05:40.048
[Pidge] It's the Altean!

05:41.215 --> 05:42.884
[Lance] Why is she helping us?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.349
[Merla] Please, do not harm them.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.436
They were misguided, much like I was.
We all were!

05:58.691 --> 06:01.027
[groaning]

06:01.110 --> 06:03.112
[Keith] Pilot capsule still intact.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.372
No!

06:16.167 --> 06:18.795
[Coran] We need an escort
to Honerva's pyramid structure!

06:18.878 --> 06:20.254
What? Right now?

06:20.588 --> 06:23.049
Yes! The sooner we go,
the higher the probability

06:23.132 --> 06:27.011
that we can use the Alteans to stop
the impending space-time rupture!

06:27.095 --> 06:29.097
It's similar to how we stopped the rupture

06:29.180 --> 06:31.307
when Voltron entered
the Quintessence field.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.391
Only this time,

06:32.475 --> 06:35.812
that superstructure will be
the energy amplification conductor

06:35.895 --> 06:38.314
and the Alteans will be the energy source.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.649
[Coran] We're still working out

06:39.732 --> 06:42.110
how to transfer their Quintessence
into the structure,

06:42.193 --> 06:45.696
but, you know, some things are just
gonna have to be figured out on the fly!

06:46.030 --> 06:47.115
Get a team in place.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.962
[Keith] Final Robeast out of commission!

07:19.313 --> 07:21.232
Hunk, form cannon!

07:23.151 --> 07:24.819
-[beeping]
-[grunting]

07:24.902 --> 07:26.154
I've got lock!

07:28.156 --> 07:30.158
[explosion]

07:45.465 --> 07:47.967
Honerva has pierced realities.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.219
[all gasp]

08:10.823 --> 08:12.992
[Keith] Come on, we're going in!

08:13.409 --> 08:15.495
Atlas, stay on me!

08:15.620 --> 08:18.247
[stutters] I'm afraid
the Atlas can't do that.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.042
Coran's right.
It isn't made out of the same ore.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.002
It can't traverse realities.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.629
Then we're going in alone.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.423
Actually, that appears to be
problematic as well.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.341
[Keith] What?

08:28.424 --> 08:31.260
The statistical likelihood of Voltron
succeeding against Honerva

08:31.344 --> 08:34.055
in a one-on-one battle
is well below improbable.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.807
We'll have a better chance
than if we don't try at all.

08:36.891 --> 08:37.725
-[booming]
-[gasps]

08:48.069 --> 08:49.111
[Allura] Balmera.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.786
[Lance] What's going on?

08:56.869 --> 09:00.039
It's a convuldrum,
the converging of Balmeras.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.083
What called them here?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.168
Shay.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.053
[Balmeras calling]

09:24.146 --> 09:26.148
[all grunting]

09:26.232 --> 09:27.900
[all screaming]

10:07.273 --> 10:08.399
Quiznak!

10:19.910 --> 10:20.828
What just...?

10:21.162 --> 10:22.246
Whoa!

10:22.830 --> 10:24.081
No way!

10:24.332 --> 10:26.000
This is crazy!

10:26.334 --> 10:29.754
I don't know what just happened,
but now we have a chance.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.547
Let's stop Honerva.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.260
Coran, we'll need you to secure the area
and find a way to suppress this rift.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.345
Yes, sir!

10:37.970 --> 10:40.139
[all screaming]

10:51.442 --> 10:54.904
Wait! I know how to get the Altean energy
into the structure.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.531
Drop Sam, Slav and I off at the pyramid.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.618
Then I'll need you to take the Alteans
to the Balmera.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.038
You're wearing the right socks today,
aren't you?

11:19.470 --> 11:20.638
Is this...

11:21.430 --> 11:23.099
[Pidge] It's an alternate Altea.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.853
[Lance] And it looks like this reality
is crumbling, just like ours!

11:27.937 --> 11:30.356
[Hunk] How come
it's disintegrating so quickly?

11:31.190 --> 11:35.111
Those wings created
a sort of cosmic tunnel in one blast.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.323
The rift must lead directly to the reality
Honerva's been looking for.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.327
[Shiro] And any reality that those wings
bored through is falling apart.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.829
We have to keep going!

11:55.214 --> 11:56.340
We must hurry!

11:57.800 --> 11:59.343
Okay, I think this is it.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.222
-Powering the amplification module.
-I'll redirect the target to the rift.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.641
If we hit it with enough energy,
it should seal.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.184
Are the Alteans in place?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.061
[N-7] They are set.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.615
[gasps]

12:23.617 --> 12:25.536
[Allura] All these innocent lives.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.581
There's no limit to what Honerva will do

12:28.914 --> 12:31.667
or the lives she'll tear apart
to get what she wants.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.711
[Shiro] That's why we need to stop her.

12:35.838 --> 12:40.426
Even then, I fear she's started
a chain reaction that can never be undone.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.014
[Coran] We're in place!

12:45.097 --> 12:47.808
Balmeras, channel your energy
into the pyramid!

12:56.066 --> 12:57.485
Yes, it's working!

12:57.943 --> 13:01.864
The channeled energy from the Balmeras
seems to be holding the rift together.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.286
[all screaming]

13:11.081 --> 13:13.375
[grunts] Countermeasures! [groans]

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
Form sword!

13:32.102 --> 13:33.479
[growls]

13:57.711 --> 13:59.964
Our current power level isn't enough
to maintain the rift!

14:00.256 --> 14:02.341
[Coran] Then we'll hold it
as long as we can.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.677
Every tick gives Voltron a chance.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.721
Coran, it's Krolia.
What can we do to help?

14:08.681 --> 14:11.850
[Coran] Krolia! Kolivan!
Thank the ancients you're here!

14:11.934 --> 14:15.521
We need all the energy we can harness
to prevent the rift from expanding.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.480
Copy that!

14:16.564 --> 14:19.066
Galra fleet, adjust the frequency
of your ion cannons

14:19.149 --> 14:20.693
and aim at the pyramid structure.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.436
[all screaming]

15:00.441 --> 15:02.985
Come on, please.
A little longer!

15:03.193 --> 15:04.570
Voltron needs us.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.863
-[explosion]
-Ah!

15:13.287 --> 15:15.623
This is where it ends for you!

15:35.059 --> 15:37.728
[groans, pants]

15:37.811 --> 15:40.522
We need to get up.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.775
I can't move.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.320
The ship's not responding.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.324
Honerva, she's absorbed all our strength.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.034
This reality...

15:53.661 --> 15:54.536
it's over.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.914
[Keith] No.

15:58.916 --> 16:03.087
We've always done the impossible.
Our strength is our bond.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.422
Our power comes from each other.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.635
As long as we're a team,
we stand a chance.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.222
-Sendak. Zarkon. Lotor.
-[groans]

16:13.597 --> 16:16.183
[Keith] We've saved our universe
countless times,

16:16.809 --> 16:20.020
but now all the realities
are in need of Voltron.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.606
So this isn't the end just yet.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.486
We need to get back up
and stop Honerva once and for all!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.256
Fire boosters!

16:47.423 --> 16:48.257
[both grunt]

17:00.769 --> 17:01.603
[gasps]

17:04.565 --> 17:07.568
[groans] The Galra fleet have depleted
all their energy,

17:07.651 --> 17:10.154
and the Balmerans and Alteans
are at their limit.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.698
At this rate, we won't be able
to contain the rift!

17:12.781 --> 17:13.615
[gasps]

17:28.881 --> 17:31.967
[all grunting]

18:06.293 --> 18:08.504
-[men shouting]
-[blade slicing]

18:08.796 --> 18:09.755
[man groans]

18:11.215 --> 18:12.216
Ha!

18:17.471 --> 18:18.555
[sighs]

18:18.931 --> 18:20.307
You're getting faster.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.643
Not half as fast as the emperor.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.019
-[booms]
-[both gasp]

18:48.919 --> 18:50.003
Stay back!

18:51.046 --> 18:52.172
What's your name?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.967
You don't recognize me?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.096
I've searched beyond the stars to be here.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.057
I said stay back!

19:03.767 --> 19:05.602
To be with you.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.357
And to be with my son.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.069
Honerva.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.867
[Zarkon] Is it truly you?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.078
It is.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.124
I never thought I'd see you again.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.751
I never doubted.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.881
My memory of you and Lotor kept me alive.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.261
Tell me, where is my child?

19:41.471 --> 19:44.641
[Zarkon] I vowed to raise our son
as you would have wanted.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.394
He excels in his Altean studies.

19:47.895 --> 19:51.106
Lotor has his mother's intellect.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.697
Empress Honerva...

19:59.072 --> 20:02.117
it is an honor to see you once more.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.162
All of Altea will cherish this day.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.165
[Allura] Please, come with me.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.918
Your son awaits your presence.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.978
My son.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.315
Mother?

20:38.528 --> 20:41.698
Please, my child, come to me.

20:42.991 --> 20:43.825
No.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.872
Lotor, it's okay. It's your mother.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.916
She has returned.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.043
She's not my mother!

20:54.294 --> 20:56.380
I may appear changed,

20:56.463 --> 21:01.009
but I assure you, my love for you
is that of a mother for her child.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.220
Come to me.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.891
She is not my mother.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.435
Don't speak like that.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.771
Please.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.440
No.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.235
[Lotor] My mother is dead.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.153
And you cannot replace her!

21:23.156 --> 21:26.034
Perhaps this is overwhelming for the boy.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.288
Please, if we had some time...

21:31.957 --> 21:35.877
[Honerva] Time?
You speak to me of time?

21:36.628 --> 21:39.298
I've spent lifetimes trying to get back.

21:39.589 --> 21:44.469
Countless worlds have fallen in the wake
of my efforts to return to you.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.472
And this is how you welcome me?

21:47.806 --> 21:52.144
My own child, my own husband
question who I am?

21:52.561 --> 21:56.064
I have sacrificed
more than you will ever know!

21:57.065 --> 22:00.027
[thrusters humming]

22:00.110 --> 22:01.028
[Zarkon] What is that?

22:04.031 --> 22:06.199
No, it cannot be!

22:07.909 --> 22:10.287
You brought this abomination upon us?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.122
You are not the empress.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.082
You are not my wife!

22:14.416 --> 22:17.085
Guards! Guards!

22:17.419 --> 22:21.173
If there is no place
in this universe for me,

22:21.256 --> 22:25.010
then there will be no universe at all.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.638
[people screaming]

22:28.722 --> 22:29.848
[thuds]

22:51.369 --> 22:53.789
[theme music playing]
