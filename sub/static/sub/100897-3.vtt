WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.046
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.875
IN MY DREAMS,
I SEE A COMMANDER
WHO FRIGHTENS ME.

00:05.918 --> 00:07.616
SHEIDHEDA,
THE DARK COMMANDER.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.183
THE FLAME AMPLIFIES
EVERY COMMANDER'S

00:09.226 --> 00:10.401
CAPACITY FOR GOOD
AND EVIL.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.924
CAN YOU KILL IT
OR NOT?

00:11.968 --> 00:14.057
IT'LL DESTROY THE FLAME.
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.537
KILL THE SON
OF A BITCH.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.279
I'M NOT THE COMMANDER
ANYMORE.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.063
-SHEIDHEDA.
-WHERE DID HE GO?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.804
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.371
SIMONE LEFT
THESE HERE.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.850
THEY WERE YOUR MOTHER'S

00:26.939 --> 00:28.071
UNH!

00:29.725 --> 00:31.118
AAH!

00:37.559 --> 00:39.691
CLARKE: SANCTUM IS FREE!

00:39.735 --> 00:41.867
WE ARE THE LAST
OF THE HUMAN RACE!

00:41.911 --> 00:43.565
WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES.

00:43.608 --> 00:47.090
TOMORROW, RUSSELL PRIME
DIES FOR HIS!

01:11.593 --> 01:13.421
ANY CHANGE?

01:13.464 --> 01:15.162
THE POWER SUPPLY'S
STILL CHOPPY
AND OSCILLATING

01:15.205 --> 01:17.599
IN THE LOWER REGION.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.992
I CAN TAKE OVER EARLY.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.342
THANKS.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.835
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THIS ALL DAY,

01:36.879 --> 01:38.489
AND I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I COULD FIX

01:38.533 --> 01:40.187
THIS POWER PROBLEM
IN 5 MINUTES.

01:40.230 --> 01:44.016
YEAH. PULL YOUR CONTROL ROD.
LET'S SEE IT.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.280
AW. COME ON.
NOT AGAIN.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.716
RAVEN'S GONNA
KILL ME.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.413
SUPPLY'S STILL LOW.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.111
PULLING THAT LAST
CONTROL ROD'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.025
IT WOULD UP
THE POWER OUTPUT.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.679
YEAH. WELL, RAVEN
SAID TO WAIT AND SEE
IF SUPPLY EVENS OUT.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.595
SURE.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.511
WE CAN WAIT.

02:00.555 --> 02:04.080
RAISING THE LAST ROD
25%.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.864
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.349
FAILURE IN
THE ACTUATOR MECHANISM.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.438
IT WON'T GO UP.

02:14.482 --> 02:18.138
STOP IT. GONNA HAVE
TO DO IT MANUALLY.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.748
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.233
COMPUTER: SECONDARY CONTAINMENT
CLEAR.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

02:35.198 --> 02:37.722
PRIYA NEVER LET US
GO IN THERE.

02:37.766 --> 02:42.553
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.034
COMPUTER: CORE ACCESS CLEAR.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.348
SINCLAIR, MY MENTOR
ON THE ARK,

02:54.391 --> 02:56.959
WAS A GENIUS
AT JURY-RIGGING
THE REACTOR.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.266
I COULD DO THIS
IN MY SLEEP.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.442
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS PULL UP THE ROD...

03:04.271 --> 03:05.968
AND USE THIS
TO KEEP IT UP.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.107
THERE. NOW WE CAN...

03:18.110 --> 03:19.416
-JAMES.
-CORA?

03:20.939 --> 03:22.593
-CORA!
-JAMES!

03:30.035 --> 03:31.907
IT'S BURNING!

04:15.342 --> 04:17.126
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.355
MY MOTHER'S RING.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.095
IT'S ALL I HAVE
LEFT OF THEM.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.401
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.490
YOU ARE WHAT'S
LEFT OF THEM.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.408
THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE COMMANDERS.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.286
I LOST MYSELF LAST NIGHT.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.636
RUSSELL GAVE ME THIS,
AND I JUST--

04:48.679 --> 04:52.335
BURNING DOWN THE PALACE
WAS A BIT EXTREME,

04:52.379 --> 04:56.296
BUT, CLARKE, HE
KILLED YOUR MOTHER
AND SO MANY OTHERS,

04:56.339 --> 04:58.341
AND TODAY, HE WILL
DIE FOR IT.

04:58.385 --> 05:02.258
MAYBE ONCE IT IS DONE,
WE CAN ALL START OVER

05:02.302 --> 05:07.219
EXCEPT FOR MADI, WHO
THEY STILL CALL HEDA,

05:07.263 --> 05:09.961
AND I'M LETTING THEM.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.963
IT MAKES ME WONDER

05:12.007 --> 05:14.096
AM I JUST DOING
WHAT I KNOW BECAUSE

05:14.139 --> 05:17.012
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
DO ANYTHING ELSE?

05:17.055 --> 05:20.624
YOU'RE DOING WHAT'S
BEST FOR MADI,

05:20.668 --> 05:24.672
BUT CHANGE TAKES TIME.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.848
WE NEED TO EASE THEM
INTO THIS NEW LIFE.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.391
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

05:51.307 --> 05:54.223
I'LL DO MY BEST
TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.416
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.426
INDRA: PREPARATIONS
MUST BE MADE.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.602
IT'S TIME TO TALK
TO RUSSELL.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.831
MAN:
SAVE THE PRIMES!

06:36.874 --> 06:38.789
WOMAN: DEATH TO PRIMES!

07:18.916 --> 07:21.310
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE PLEASURE?

07:21.353 --> 07:23.225
DON'T PLAY INNOCENT.
WE KNOW YOUR PEOPLE

07:23.268 --> 07:24.705
HAVE BEEN IN
TO SEE YOU.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.097
I CAN HARDLY TURN
THEM AWAY

07:26.141 --> 07:27.795
IF THEY SHOW UP.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.492
INDRA: IT WON'T BE
A PROBLEM FOR MUCH LONGER.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.799
YOUR EXECUTION'S
AT SUNSET.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.715
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE RESPECT
OF CHOOSING HOW YOU DIE.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.024
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST
FINISHED THE JOB
LAST NIGHT.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.504
WE CAN MAKE IT QUICK.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.506
AND WHY WOULD I
WANT THAT?

07:43.550 --> 07:46.335
TO MY FOLLOWERS,
THIS WILL BE
THE DEATH OF A GOD.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.909
LIKE A SIGN
FROM ABOVE.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.954
I'LL TAKE THE PYRE.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.870
LAST NIGHT, YOU BEGGED ME
TO SAVE YOU FROM HE FLAMES.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.743
AND NOW YOU WANT IT
QUICK SO YOU CAN
PRETEND

08:02.786 --> 08:04.440
YOU'RE STILL CIVILIZED.

08:04.484 --> 08:10.011
NO. MY PEOPLE NEED
TO FEEL MY DEATH,

08:10.054 --> 08:11.578
AND SO DO YOU.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.885
INDRA: VERY WELL.
FIRE IT IS.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.803
GUARD!

08:35.297 --> 08:38.518
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

08:40.998 --> 08:42.826
PEOPLE: DEATH TO PRIMES!

08:50.747 --> 08:53.576
YOU DESERVE TO BURN
FOR KILLING PRIYA.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.362
DELILAH DESERVED JUSTICE.

08:57.406 --> 09:00.583
AND IF YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM, LEAVE.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.502
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.460
THEY'RE JUST GONNA
KILL EACH OTHER
AS SOON AS WE LEAVE.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.512
HOW MESSED UP IS IT
THAT I'M LOOKING

09:16.556 --> 09:18.340
FORWARD
TO AN EXECUTION?

09:18.383 --> 09:21.386
HEY. WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.693
-IT'S JUSTICE FOR ABBY.
-OF COURSE YOU'RE FINE WITH IT,

09:23.737 --> 09:25.390
BUT I'M A DOCTOR.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.957
I SHOULD BE BETTER.

09:27.001 --> 09:31.614
BETTER? I'M NOT JUST
FOLLOWING ORDERS, JAX.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.355
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.313
MAN: DEATH TO PRIMES!

09:38.012 --> 09:39.883
RUSSELL WON'T STAND
FOR IT.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.146
RUSSELL WON'T STAND
FOR ANYTHING
IF HE'S DEAD.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.670
WE HAVE TO STOP IT,

09:43.713 --> 09:45.541
RETURN HIM TO HIS
RIGHTFUL PLACE.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.065
YES, BUT NOT
WITH VIOLENCE.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.632
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:52.026 --> 09:53.897
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.769
YOU BETRAYED RUSSELL.
YOU DON'T GET TO

09:55.812 --> 09:57.205
PRETEND TO BE
ONE OF US.

10:01.122 --> 10:04.473
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR RUSSELL TO--

10:04.516 --> 10:07.998
CLARKE JUST SAID
SHE WANTED TO
TALK TO HIM.

10:08.042 --> 10:11.045
TREY'S JUST...UPSET.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.700
ALYSSA...

10:13.743 --> 10:17.181
I CAN SEE YOU
DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
TALK TO ME.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.183
THE PAST COUPLE DAYS,

10:19.227 --> 10:22.186
SO MANY OF THE FAITHFUL
HAVEN'T HANDLED IT WELL.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.449
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE
PLANNING SOMETHING TERRIBLE

10:24.493 --> 10:26.800
TO SAVE RUSSELL.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.503
IF RUSSELL TOLD
THEM TO STOP,
WOULD THEY?

10:34.546 --> 10:36.548
OF COURSE.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.203
HIS WILL BE DONE.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.728
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

10:41.771 --> 10:43.599
I'M THINKING THAT
I'LL TAKE HIM

10:43.643 --> 10:47.385
MORE THAN JUST
HIS COFFEE THIS MORNING.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.126
MURPHY: THIS LOOKS
LIKE FUN.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.216
THEY'RE BURNING RUSSELL
AT THE STAKE TONIGHT,

10:52.260 --> 10:54.218
AND I WONDER
WHO'S NEXT.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.960
OUR PEOPLE WILL NEVER
LET THAT HAPPEN.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
COME BACK TO BED.

11:01.791 --> 11:06.317
DOESN'T THIS FEEL
WRONG TO YOU?

11:06.361 --> 11:08.363
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE HAVE A CHOICE,

11:08.406 --> 11:12.106
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL
ENJOY IT.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.325
-OH, ENJOY IT?
-MMM. MM-HMM.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.327
-ENJOY IT.
-HEH HEH HEH.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.590
GOOD MORNING.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.505
6 YEARS OF YOU WALKING
IN ON US IN SPACE,

11:20.549 --> 11:21.985
AND YOU STILL CAN'T KNOCK.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.421
IT'S INCREDIBLE REALLY.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.727
WELL, YOU'D THINK
YOU COULD LOCK A DOOR.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.076
WHAT'S UP, RAVEN?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.512
CLEARLY NOT THE REACTOR.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.862
POWER'S OUT ALL OVER
SANCTUM.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.951
JAMES FAILED ME AGAIN.
GET DRESSED.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.648
TIME TO PROVE HOW MUCH
YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION

11:32.692 --> 11:33.997
ON THE RING.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.397
YEAH.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.249
JAMES?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.819
CORE TEMP IS UP,
COOLANT PRESSURE'S DOWN.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.646
WHERE THE HELL
IS JAMES?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.692
THE DOOR'S OPEN.
COME ON.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.262
EMORI: WAIT.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.922
RADIATION'S NORMAL.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.621
JAMES!

12:34.101 --> 12:36.581
OVER HERE.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.933
THAT'S BAD.

12:39.976 --> 12:44.154
EMORI: HERE, THE RADIATION
IS ELEVATED.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.243
THIS IS JUST WATER
FROM THE COOLANT
SYSTEM,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.506
BUT IF RADIATION
IS LEAKING HERE,

12:48.550 --> 12:50.247
IT MUST BE COMING
FROM THE CORE.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.560
DON'T.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.040
RAVEN, WE NEED TO
HELP THEM.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.606
NO. IT'S TOO LATE.
LOOK AT THEM.

13:05.349 --> 13:08.048
HE MUST HAVE PULLED
THE CONTROL ROD TOO FAST.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.963
THE SPIKE OF RADIATION
WOULD BE LETHAL.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.623
IF THE CORE REACHES
1,500 DEGREES,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.234
THE WHOLE REACTOR
MELTS DOWN.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.455
WE'LL ALL DIE.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.897
MAN: DEATH TO PRIMES!

13:40.558 --> 13:43.344
-FROM INDRA.
-DOES IT MATTER?

13:43.387 --> 13:45.259
IT'LL ALL TURN
TO ASH.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.869
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
DEATH.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.875
WANTING TO DIE
AND FACING IT

13:52.919 --> 13:54.442
ARE TWO
DIFFERENT THINGS.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.531
-NOW GO.
-NO.

13:59.229 --> 14:02.102
YOU CAN STILL
HELP YOUR PEOPLE.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.278
-THEY DON'T NEED ME.
-THEY DO.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.714
THEY'RE PLANNING
SOME KIND OF ATTACK.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.585
THEY WANT TO STOP
THE EXECUTION.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.935
PEOPLE WILL DIE.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.938
THEN TELL THEM
NOT TO KILL ME.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.635
THAT'S IT?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.245
YOU EXPECTED
SOMETHING ELSE?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.900
FOR YOU TO CARE.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.468
IT'S IN YOUR NAME.
IS THAT THE LEGACY
YOU WANT,

14:20.511 --> 14:22.818
DEATH AND MORE DEATH?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.428
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

14:24.472 --> 14:28.868
YOU STILL HAVE A VOICE.
TALK TO THEM. STOP THEM.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.522
GO OUT DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

14:31.566 --> 14:34.917
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY'LL LET ME
ADDRESS MY PEOPLE?

14:34.961 --> 14:36.832
BECAUSE MY PEOPLE WANT
TO BE DO BETTER.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.748
I CAN TELL.
BURNING A MAN
AT THE STAKE

14:39.791 --> 14:43.578
IS SO ELEVATED.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.928
MAYBE IF YOU ASK
THEM NICELY.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.931
I'M NOT THE ONE ASKING.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.541
MY FATHER'S SON IS.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.039
GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.954
SHOULDN'T WE BE WEARING
HAZMAT SUITS OR SOMETHING?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.956
RAVEN: YOU ARE
ADORABLE.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.915
THOSE LITERALLY DO
NOTHING AGAINST
GAMMA RAYS.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.960
ELIGIUS THREE KNEW THAT,
WHICH IS WHY THEY
DON'T HAVE ANY.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.920
WHAT THEY DID HAVE
IS NIGHTBLOOD,
AND SO DO YOU.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.401
YOU'RE A PRIME
NOW, MURPHY.
ACT LIKE ONE.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.795
GET TO THE POINT.

15:26.838 --> 15:30.451
HERE'S THE DEAL.
THE CORE'S OVERHEATING.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.192
ONE OF THE CONTROL RODS
THAT SLOWS

15:32.235 --> 15:34.281
THE NUCLEAR REACTION
DOWN IS JAMMED
IN THE UP POSITION

15:34.324 --> 15:35.891
AND WON'T DROP
INTO THE CORE.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.849
BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S
GETTING TOO HOT,

15:37.893 --> 15:40.765
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
THE COOLANT PIPE HAS
BURST IN TWO PLACES.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.246
IF THE CORE TEMPERATURE
REACHES 1,500 DEGREES,

15:43.290 --> 15:44.856
THE REACTOR
WILL MELT DOWN,

15:44.900 --> 15:46.815
AND IT'S BYE-BYE
SANCTUM.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.167
SO HOW DO WE STOP IT?

15:51.211 --> 15:52.734
WE PUSH IN
THE CONTROL RODS,

15:52.777 --> 15:54.214
WE PLUG THE CRACKS,
WE'RE GOOD.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.824
JUST THAT SIMPLE.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.652
I LIKE YOU.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.219
SOMEONE HAS TO GO
INTO PRIMARY
CONTAINMENT

15:59.262 --> 16:00.872
TO GET THE CONTROL RODS
IN PLACE.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.744
IT'S A HIGH-RADIATION
ENVIRONMENT.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.964
NIGHTBLOOD'S NOT
A GUARANTEE,
BUT IT WILL HELP.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.010
-SHE'LL DO IT.
-I'LL DO IT.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.925
WHAT? LIKE THAT WAS
EVEN A QUESTION?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.709
INDRA: CLARKE, YOU HAVE
YOUR HANDS FULL

16:11.753 --> 16:15.017
WITH RUSSELL'S EXECUTION.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.236
CLARKE: OK.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.759
MURPHY, YOU'RE
B-TEAM.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.065
EMORI WILL HANDLE
THE CONTROL RODS,

16:19.108 --> 16:20.892
BUT SHE ONLY HAS
60 SECONDS.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
IF SHE DOESN'T GET
IT DONE, YOU
TAKE OVER.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.113
WONKRU WILL HANDLE
THE PIPES.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.898
EMORI SAID RADIATION
IS LEAKING.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.466
WHAT KIND OF DANGER
AM I SENDING
MY PEOPLE INTO?

16:29.510 --> 16:31.816
IT'S THE PUKING
FOR A FEW DAYS KIND.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.470
IF THEY'RE EXPOSED,
THEY'LL RECOVER.

16:33.514 --> 16:36.604
IF THE CORE MELTS DOWN,
WE WON'T.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.171
CLARKE: WHY DON'T WE ASK
THE ELIGIUS CREW?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.086
THEY WERE MINERS.
THEY HAVE THE SKILLS.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.131
NO OFFENSE, BUT I'M
NOT WILLING TO PUT

16:42.175 --> 16:44.133
THE LIVES
OF WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE HUMAN RACE

16:44.177 --> 16:45.787
IN THE HANDS
OF A BUNCH
OF MURDERERS

16:45.830 --> 16:47.354
AND THIEVES WHO WERE
TORTURING ME AND SHAW

16:47.397 --> 16:49.008
AND WILLING TO KILL
THE REST OF US

16:49.051 --> 16:51.053
BEFORE DESTROYING
THE EARTH.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.012
I NEED A TEAM OF 4
FROM THE BUNKER'S
MAINTENANCE CREW.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.841
YOU'LL HAVE THEM.
4 WONKRU WELDERS
COMING RIGHT UP.

17:00.280 --> 17:04.153
INDRA: IT'S DANGEROUS,
BUT YOUR COMMANDER WILLS IT.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.589
WHO WILL ANSWER
HER CALL?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.291
AND WHERE IS
THE COMMANDER?

17:11.334 --> 17:13.380
SHE HAS OTHER MATTERS
TO HANDLE,

17:13.423 --> 17:16.426
BUT I HAVE HER
COMPLETE AUTHORITY.

17:16.470 --> 17:19.777
I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.041
I THINK SHE
ABANDONED US.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
SOMETHING HAPPENED
ON THAT SHIP,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.393
AND SHE HASN'T BEEN
THE SAME SINCE WE
REACHED THE GROUND.

17:28.177 --> 17:31.224
YOU QUESTION THE WILL
OF YOUR COMMANDER?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.530
I QUESTION YOU.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.315
IF THE COMMANDER WANTS
VOLUNTEERS,

17:35.358 --> 17:39.014
LET HER TELL US HERSELF.

17:39.058 --> 17:43.279
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO GET HER,

17:43.323 --> 17:48.415
BUT YOU WILL ANSWER
FOR YOUR DISOBEDIENCE.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.766
INDRA, NO. WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.333
PEOPLE COULD DIE.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.856
WE CAN'T PUT THAT
ON MADI.

17:54.899 --> 17:57.337
YOU TWO TREAT HER
LIKE SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

17:57.380 --> 18:02.124
SHE IS NOT.
IT IS TIME YOU LET HER
DO HER JOB FOR ALL OF US.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.691
MADI IS NOT WELL.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.476
YOU CAN USE HER NAME,
BUT THAT'S IT.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.739
NO WAY AM I LETTING HER
STAND IN FRONT

18:08.783 --> 18:10.219
OF THESE PEOPLE
AND ORDER THEM

18:10.263 --> 18:11.960
INTO A NUCLEAR REACTOR.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.005
-NOT HAPPENING.
-WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.659
WE NEED VOLUNTEERS.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.574
WITHOUT THEM,
SHE DIES, TOO,

18:17.618 --> 18:19.533
WHEN THAT REACTOR
MELTS DOWN.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.231
WE TELL THEM
THE TRUTH.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.146
DON'T BE A FOOL, GAIA.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.887
HAVE SOME FAITH
IN OUR PEOPLE,
MOTHER.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.716
I KNOW OUR PEOPLE.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.457
MAN: WHY THE DELAY?

18:40.380 --> 18:44.079
WE CANNOT ASK
THE COMMANDER

18:44.123 --> 18:46.299
BECAUSE THERE IS
NO COMMANDER.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.521
SHE HAD FALLEN PREY
TO SHEIDHEDA.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.175
THE DARK COMMANDER
TOOK HER OVER,

18:53.219 --> 18:56.874
AND I COULD NOT LET
THAT MONSTER LEAD WONKRU,

18:56.918 --> 18:59.225
SO I DESTROYED THE FLAME.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.444
THAT MONSTER WAS SANGEDAKRU'S
GREATEST CHAMPION.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.707
-YOU HAD NO RIGHT!
-I HAD EVERY RIGHT.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.448
I AM THE FLEIMKEPA.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.712
YOU WERE
THE FLEIMKEPA.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.237
YOU'VE SINNED
AGAINST US ALL.
YOU'RE A TRAITOR.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.195
KNIGHT, PLEASE.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.110
WE SPENT 6 YEARS
TOGETHER IN THE BUNKER

19:15.154 --> 19:16.720
WITHOUT A COMMANDER.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.288
THE FLAME MIGHT BE GONE,
BUT WE ARE STILL HERE.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.421
WE ARE STILL ONE PEOPLE,

19:21.464 --> 19:24.250
AND WE ARE ALL
IN DANGER.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.165
WHO WILL BE BRAVE ENOUGH
TO HELP US?

19:35.826 --> 19:37.480
SO MUCH
FOR VOLUNTEERS.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.572
SANGEDAKRU,
WE'RE DONE HERE.

19:48.752 --> 19:52.756
FAITH MAY BE BLIND,
BUT LOYALTY ISN'T.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.454
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.369
YOU JUST LOST WONKRU.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.859
MAN: ADD SOME MORE KINDLING.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.919
THEY PUT US HERE
ON PURPOSE,

20:24.962 --> 20:28.531
RUBBING THE PALACE
IN OUR FACES.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.099
IT'S DELIBERATE
DISRESPECT.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.841
LOOK. THEY SAID THAT
THEY WERE GONNA FIND
US SOMETHING BETTER,

20:33.884 --> 20:35.103
AND THEY WILL.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.670
WHEN DID YOU GET
SO NAIVE?

20:39.020 --> 20:41.109
THEY'RE MAKING US
DO THE HARD WORK

20:41.152 --> 20:43.546
AND GIVING US TENTS
AND SCRAPS

20:43.590 --> 20:45.200
FROM THEIR TABLE.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.072
I SEE THE WAY
THEY LOOK AT US.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.770
YOU ALL DO, TOO.

20:49.813 --> 20:52.860
HATCH: LOOK.
WE DID OUR TIME,
AND THEY KNOW IT.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.775
WE HELP THEM BUILD
THE NEW COMPOUND,

20:54.818 --> 20:56.516
AND IT WILL BE
OURS, TOO.

20:58.518 --> 21:02.870
AND I'M TAKING
THE PENTHOUSE FOR
US, HONEY BUNNY.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.570
RAVEN: HEY.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.967
HATCH, RIGHT?
I'M RAVEN.

21:13.010 --> 21:17.101
YEAH. I REMEMBER.
McCREARY'S GUEST.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.452
BOY, I DO NOT MISS
THAT JACKASS.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.454
-MM-HMM.
-HE WOULDN'T HAVE SETTLED

21:21.497 --> 21:23.586
FOR A SQUATTERS' CAMP.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.501
HEH. YEAH, YEAH.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.590
ARE YOU LOST
OR SOMETHING?

21:27.634 --> 21:30.593
I COULD USE SOME HELP,
AND YOUR PEOPLE
HAVE THE SKILLS.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.334
LOOK AT THAT.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.771
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE
RESPECT TO ME.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.774
TRY INDENTURED
SERVITUDE.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
HMM.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.474
YOU AIN'T THE ONLY
SMART ONE AROUND HERE, HONEY.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.737
IT'S A SIMPLE JOB.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.870
JUST WELDING A COUPLE
CRACKS IN THE REACTOR'S
COOLANT PIPE.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.524
THE NUCLEAR REACTOR?

21:48.568 --> 21:51.005
YEAH. IT'S
FAIRLY ROUTINE.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.615
THE EQUIPMENT'S A COUPLE
HUNDRED YEARS OLD,

21:52.659 --> 21:56.010
SO JUST NEEDS
SOME LOVE.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.794
SOME LOVE, HUH?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.623
FROM WHERE I SIT,

22:00.667 --> 22:03.713
LOVE IS DANGEROUS.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.063
RAVEN: LIKE I SAID,
IT'S ROUTINE.

22:06.107 --> 22:10.633
NO. YOU SAID,
"FAIRLY ROUTINE."

22:10.677 --> 22:12.505
THE PIPE'S
IN SECONDARY CONTAINMENT.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.637
IT'S NOWHERE
NEAR THE REACTOR.

22:14.681 --> 22:17.553
I JUST NEED 4 PEOPLE
WHO KNOW THEIR WAY
AROUND WELDING.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.599
WHAT'S IN IT
FOR US?

22:19.642 --> 22:21.949
WHY DOES THERE NEED
TO BE SOMETHING
IN IT FOR YOU?

22:21.992 --> 22:25.344
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

22:25.387 --> 22:31.306
HATCH: HOW ABOUT
ALL THE JO JUICE
THAT WE CAN DRINK?

22:31.350 --> 22:35.092
SURE.
YOU IN OR NOT?

22:35.136 --> 22:37.747
HATCH: WHAT THE HELL?
WE'RE IN.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.184
-NOT ME.
-WHAT?

22:40.228 --> 22:42.012
YOU HAVE FUN,
SUGAR,

22:42.056 --> 22:43.318
AND I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU

22:43.362 --> 22:44.885
IN THE PENTHOUSE TENT.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.193
LET'S GO.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.853
X, Y, AND Z,
FOLLOW ME.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.160
CLARKE: LOOKS LIKE
RAVEN FOUND
HE VOLUNTEERS.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.815
MAYBE THOSE PRISONERS
CAN HELP GUARD
OUR PRISONER.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.947
HOW MANY WONKRU
ARE STILL WITH US?

23:03.991 --> 23:05.166
NOT ENOUGH.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.168
JORDAN:
THERE YOU ARE.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.213
NOW WHAT'S WRONG?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.911
RUSSELL'S FOLLOWERS
ARE PLANNING SOME
KIND OF ATTACK.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.913
WHICH FOLLOWERS?
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

23:12.956 --> 23:14.915
ALL I KNOW IS IT'S
HAPPENING BEFORE
THE EXECUTION.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.656
AND WE DON'T HAVE
THE PEOPLE TO STOP IT.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.222
ALL WE NEED IS
RUSSELL.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.181
LET HIM TALK
THEM DOWN.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.139
LOOK DOWN THERE.
HE'S THE REASON

23:22.183 --> 23:23.837
THEY NEED TALKING DOWN.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.882
IS THAT WHO WE
ARE NOW?

23:25.926 --> 23:28.581
AT WHAT POINT ARE
WE GONNA SET
AN EXAMPLE?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.540
WHAT HAPPENED
TO DOING BETTER?

23:31.584 --> 23:33.455
WHAT WOULD
MY DAD SAY?

23:35.196 --> 23:37.328
JACKSON: RUSSELL
KILLED ABBY,

23:37.372 --> 23:39.243
AND HE DESERVES
TO DIE FOR IT.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.768
IS THAT YOUR
MEDICAL OPINION?

23:41.811 --> 23:43.596
DR. JACKSON IS RIGHT.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.208
WE CAN'T SHOW WEAKNESS,
NOT NOW.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.950
FINE, BUT IF YOU
WANT TO AVOID
MORE KILLING,

23:49.993 --> 23:52.256
YOU'LL LET HIS
PEOPLE HEAR
FROM HIM FIRST.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.347
I TALKED TO HIM.
HE WANTS TO HELP.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.437
INDRA, WITHOUT WONKRU,
WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE

23:58.480 --> 24:00.177
TO CONTROL THE RIOT.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.528
JORDAN'S IDEA IS
WORTH A SHOT.

24:02.571 --> 24:06.357
INDRA: FINE, BUT RUSSELL
SAYS WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO,

24:06.401 --> 24:08.447
OR I'LL KILL HIM MYSELF.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.369
HATCH: MAKE SURE YOU PROTECT
THE SECURE ENTRY OUT.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.936
WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
50 MORE DEGREES,

24:19.980 --> 24:21.503
AND WE'RE TOAST.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.287
EVERYONE CLEAR ON WHAT
THEY'RE DOING?

24:23.331 --> 24:24.941
HATCH: CRYSTAL.
EMORI: WE GET THE CONTROL RODS

24:24.985 --> 24:27.509
IN PLACE, THEN HEAD
TO DECONTAMINATION.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.990
AND WE WELD THE CRACKS
IN THE PIPE.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.731
THAT RADIATION
STILL CLEAR?

24:31.774 --> 24:34.951
RAVEN: YEP. ALL CLEAR.
GOOD LUCK.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.524
COMPUTER: SECONDARY CONTAINMENT
CLEAR.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.354
YOU LIED TO THEM?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.312
I TOLD THEM WHAT
THEY NEEDED TO KNOW.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.140
IT'S AN EASY JOB.
I COULD DO IT IN MY SLEEP.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.447
-THEN WHY DON'T YOU?
-SHUT UP, MURPHY.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.841
EITHER THEY'RE SICK
FOR A FEW DAYS,
OR WE'RE DEAD FOREVER.

24:54.884 --> 24:58.366
NOW GO DO YOUR JOB
BEING EMORI'S MORAL ANCHOR.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.759
CAN WE NOT FIGHT
NOW?

25:10.857 --> 25:13.033
COMPUTER: SECONDARY CONTAINMENT
CLEAR.

25:13.076 --> 25:16.558
HATCH: THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE MINING HYTHYLODIUM
ON AN ASTEROID.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.560
WE DO THE JOB.
WE'RE IN, WE'RE OUT,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.997
AND THEN THE JO JUICE
IS ON ME.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.738
MAN: SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.268
I'LL START THE CLOCK
WHEN YOU GET IN THERE.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.835
YOU BETTER GET IT DONE
IN UNDER 60

25:32.879 --> 25:35.272
BECAUSE I WAS NOT REALLY
PAYING ATTENTION.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.406
-COMFORTING.
-THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.452
HEY, HEY.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.978
-DON'T BE A HERO, OK?
-OK.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.719
COCKROACH PROTOCOL
IN EFFECT.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.155
THAT-A-GIRL.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.202
RAVEN: COME ON, EMORI.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.595
LET'S GO!

25:53.639 --> 25:55.423
COMPUTER: CORE ACCESS CLEAR.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.605
RAVEN, ON INTERCOM:
GO ON, EMORI.
YOU'VE GOT THIS.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.346
AS SOON AS ALL THE RODS
ARE DOWN,

26:05.389 --> 26:06.739
THE REACTION WILL FLOW,
AND THE CORE TEMPERATURE

26:06.782 --> 26:08.392
WILL GO DOWN.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.744
55 SECONDS!

26:14.485 --> 26:15.878
AAH!

26:18.925 --> 26:20.535
50 SECONDS!

26:20.579 --> 26:22.102
UNH!

26:22.145 --> 26:24.626
SKIP THAT ONE FOR NOW.
GET THE OTHERS.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.106
MURPHY: 40!

26:37.465 --> 26:39.075
COME ON, EMORI.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.469

YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE. GET GOING.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.434

26:50.478 --> 26:52.001
20 SECONDS, EMORI!

26:57.354 --> 26:59.313
RAVEN: LAST ONE.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.232
WE'RE 10 SECONDS.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.760
UNH!

27:21.901 --> 27:24.773
-TIME, EMORI!
-EMORI, GET OUT OF THERE NOW!

27:29.909 --> 27:31.475
COME ON!

27:39.527 --> 27:40.746
WHAT THE HELL?

27:40.789 --> 27:42.095
GET TO DECONTAMINATION NOW!

27:42.138 --> 27:44.271
STILL CLIMBING?
DAMN IT!

27:44.314 --> 27:46.142
WE NEED THE COOLANT
LINE FIXED!

27:46.186 --> 27:47.796
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.580
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
EASY. COME ON.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.887
THE DECON SHOWER WILL REMOVE
95% OF THE RADIATION.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.718
NOT PAYING
ATTENTION, HUH?

27:56.762 --> 27:58.677
YEAH. DON'T RUIN
MY REP. COME ON.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.031
YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO HEAR HIS WISDOM.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.859
PAY ATTENTION.
IT'LL BE THE LAST

28:06.902 --> 28:08.469
YOU EVER HEAR
FROM HIM.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.435
IF YOU SAY
THE WRONG THING,

28:18.479 --> 28:21.656
YOU WON'T GET TO
CHOOSE YOUR DEATH.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.919
INDRA WILL PUT
A BULLET IN YOUR BRAIN

28:23.963 --> 28:25.878
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

28:25.921 --> 28:29.490
WE WANT THE SAME THING,
CLARKE--PEACE.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.013
I HOPE THAT'S TRUE.

28:36.584 --> 28:40.719
MY CHILDREN,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.851
I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.287
I AM, TOO,

28:44.331 --> 28:46.246
BUT IF MY DEATH IS NEEDED
TO HEAL

28:46.289 --> 28:48.814
THIS WONDROUS PLACE,

28:48.857 --> 28:51.033
THEN I GO
TO THAT DEATH WILLINGLY.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.736
RUSSELL:
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.825
SHH, SHH, SHH.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.392
I MUST DIE FOR MY SINS,

29:02.436 --> 29:04.438
BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE
REVENGE.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.527
THAT IS NOT OUR WAY.

29:06.570 --> 29:10.357
OUR FAITH HAS ALWAYS
BEEN ONE OF PEACE.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.924
CLARKE IS RIGHT.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.491
WE ARE ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.885
EITHER WE LIVE TOGETHER

29:16.929 --> 29:18.669
OR DIE APART.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.759
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE PLANNING...

29:20.802 --> 29:22.195
FALSE GOD!

29:23.631 --> 29:25.415
TOBIN, NO!

29:28.854 --> 29:30.551
SO MUCH FOR
A PEACEFUL FAITH.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.946
INDRA: STOP! STOP!

29:33.989 --> 29:35.556
JACKSON, SAVE HIM.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.471
HE MISSED
THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY.

29:37.514 --> 29:41.736
JONES! GET OVER HERE.
HELP ME.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.911
JORDAN: EVERYBODY, MOVE!

29:42.955 --> 29:45.827
JACKSON: COME ON.

29:45.871 --> 29:49.483
OK. LET'S GET HIM
TO MEDICAL.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.877
-WILL HE SURVIVE?
-I--I THINK SO.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.400
I HOPE SO BECAUSE
IF HE DOESN'T

29:53.443 --> 29:54.880
THESE FANATICS
WILL HAVE A MARTYR.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.230
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
ONCE THAT HAPPENS,

29:57.273 --> 29:58.927
WITHOUT WONKRU
TO KEEP THE PEACE,

29:58.971 --> 30:01.190
SOMETHING WILL EXPLODE.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.410
-WE CAN'T KILL HIM.
-NO, WE CAN'T.

30:03.453 --> 30:07.196
SUDDENLY,
A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN
DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.677
BREAK IT UP!
BREAK IT UP!

30:14.029 --> 30:16.815
WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
AMIGO. STEADY.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.817
I CAN TASTE
THE JO JUICE ALREADY.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.383
AGH!

30:20.427 --> 30:21.732
DAMN IT!

30:25.388 --> 30:27.477
THE COOLANT PRESSURE'S
TOO HIGH.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.436
YOU NEED TO REROUTE IT.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.569
I CAN'T. WE NEED IT
TO CONTROL THE CORE TEMP.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.136
WE'RE 20 DEGREES
FROM FINDING OUT

30:34.180 --> 30:36.443
WHAT COMES AFTER DEATH,
AND I'D RATHER NOT KNOW.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.751
ME NEITHER.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.982
-ANY CHANGE?
-THE RATE HAS SLOWED,

30:54.026 --> 30:56.724
BUT THE CORE TEMPERATURE'S
STILL RISING.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.596
MURPHY: AGH.

31:04.427 --> 31:08.431
YOU WANTED FOREVER.

31:08.475 --> 31:11.043
STILL DO. COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.569
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

31:15.612 --> 31:17.484
AT THIS RATE
OF INCREASE,

31:17.527 --> 31:18.833
NOT LONG ENOUGH.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.617
MURPHY: THEN GET IN THERE
AND HELP.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.184
RAVEN, YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE, RIGHT?

31:22.228 --> 31:23.490
I'LL SPIN THE DIALS.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.144
I'M NOT JUST
TURNING DIALS.

31:25.187 --> 31:26.797
I'M CONTROLLING
THE FLOW
OF COOLANT.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.277
ONE MISTAKE, AND--

31:28.321 --> 31:31.237
MURPHY: OHH!
RAVEN: CRAP.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.239
OH, YEAH. THAT MAKES ME
FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

31:33.282 --> 31:38.505
RAVEN...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:38.548 --> 31:40.202
MURPHY NEVER WENT
INTO PRIMARY
CONTAINMENT.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.682
IF HE'S GETTING SICK,
THAT MEANS

31:41.725 --> 31:43.902
MORE RADIATION'S
LEAKING THAN
I THOUGHT.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.562
WE HAVE TO PULL
THEM OUT OF THERE.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.086
HEY. WHAT HELL IS
HAPPENING?

31:54.129 --> 31:57.959
MY GUYS ARE
GETTING SICK.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.919
NO. THEY'RE ALMOST DONE.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.616
IT'S JUST THE XENON GAS
MAKING YOU DIZZY.

32:02.659 --> 32:05.401
DON'T WORRY. IT'S A BYPRODUCT
OF NUCLEAR FISSION.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.146
-ARE YOU OK?
-CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.627
HATCH: IT'S JUST SOME GAS
MAKING OUR HEADS ALL FUZZY.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.368
GET BACK TO WORK.

32:15.411 --> 32:19.633
RAVEN, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THEM IN THERE TO DIE.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.417
THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.984
RAVEN, YOU REALLY
NEED TO THINK ABOUT--

32:23.028 --> 32:25.682
ENOUGH. IF WE PULL
THEM OUT, WE ALL DIE.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.816
THEY CAN STILL DO IT.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.644
WELL, AT LEAST
TELL THEM.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.167
YOU THINK I CAN RELY
ON THOSE GUYS TO DO
THE RIGHT THING

32:32.211 --> 32:33.734
WHEN THEY KNOW THEY'RE
GONNA DIE?

32:33.777 --> 32:37.781
HEY. MY TEAM'S
ALMOST OUT OF NITROGEN.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.001
I'LL GET YOU ANOTHER TANK.
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU?

32:40.045 --> 32:42.656
WE'RE ALMOST THERE ON ONE,
BUT I CAN'T GET

32:42.699 --> 32:44.223
MY PATCH TO HOLD.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.746
YOU NEED TO LOWER
THE PRESSURE MORE.

32:45.789 --> 32:46.965
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.531
THE TEMPERATURE
WILL SPIKE.

32:48.575 --> 32:52.492
DAMN IT! JUST--
JUST GET ME THE NITRO.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.976
RAVEN: SHE'LL BE FINE.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.934
NIGHTBLOOD METABOLIZES
RADIATION.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.633
WE'LL GET HER TO JACKSON
AS SOON AS YOU TAKE
THIS TO HATCH.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.070
MURPHY.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.595
IF YOU DON'T
AND THE CORE MELTS DOWN,

33:08.638 --> 33:10.553
NOT EVEN NIGHTBLOOD
WILL SAVE YOU.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.952
COMPUTER: SECONDARY CONTAINMENT
CLEAR.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.002
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO RELY ON THEM,

33:24.045 --> 33:25.873
BUT YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.744
COMPUTER: SECONDARY CONTAINMENT
SEALED.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.018
GO BE A COCKROACH.

33:45.284 --> 33:46.850
RAVEN, ON INTERCOM:
HERE'S THE SITUATION.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.983
THE TEMPERATURE IS
1,490 DEGREES,

33:49.027 --> 33:51.638
10 DEGREES FROM MELTDOWN.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.553
WELD FASTER.

33:53.596 --> 33:57.035
I GOT IT. COME ON.
LET'S DO THIS THING.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.910
XENON GAS, HUH?

34:07.306 --> 34:09.090
YOU'RE ONE OF THE PRIMES.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.832
MEANS YOU HAD THAT
BLOOD ALTERATION.

34:11.875 --> 34:16.010
NO WONDER THEY CHOSE
YOU AND YOUR LADY
FOR THE CORE.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.274
LET'S SAY WE TALK
AFTER THE MELTDOWN, HUH?

34:19.318 --> 34:23.931
ALL RIGHT, BUT, YOU SEE,
I--I'VE GOT SOMEONE

34:23.974 --> 34:25.672
THAT I LOVE OUT THERE,

34:25.715 --> 34:28.936
AND FROM WHAT I SAW,
YOU DO, TOO.

34:28.979 --> 34:31.591
NO MATTER WHAT,
WE GET THIS DONE.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.122
1,492.

34:41.166 --> 34:44.778
COLUMBUS SAILED
THE OCEAN BLUE.

34:44.821 --> 34:50.610
YOU NOW, NIKS AND I,
WE HAD A PRETTY SWEET
SCORE ONCE IN COLUMBUS.

34:50.653 --> 34:54.135
THAT SAVINGS AND LOAN,
HELL, THEY NEVER EVEN
SAW IT COMING,

34:54.179 --> 34:56.006
AND NOW I'M
ON ANOTHER PLANET

34:56.050 --> 34:59.140
TRYING TO STOP
A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN.

34:59.184 --> 35:03.666
THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A LIFE, HUH?

35:03.710 --> 35:05.581
1,494.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.628
I DON'T GOT ANY
FOR 1494.

35:08.671 --> 35:12.066
YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE WORST
OF THE WORST.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.286
BANK ROBBER DOESN'T
SOUND SO BAD.

35:14.329 --> 35:18.203
YEAH, IT WASN'T
UNTIL IT BECAME HOMICIDE.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.683
HELL, IT WAS FUN
UNTIL THEN, TOO.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.512
NIKKI--SHE SHOT FIRST.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.646
ONCE THOSE FIRST TWO
COPS WERE DEAD,

35:26.689 --> 35:28.561
HELL, IT WAS ALREADY
A MURDER RAP,

35:28.604 --> 35:31.955
SO WE EXECUTED
THE HOSTAGES.

35:31.999 --> 35:36.438
LEAVE NO WITNESSES,
AM I RIGHT?

35:36.482 --> 35:40.616
MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE
UP FOR IT.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.140
THERE'S NO MAKING UP
FOR IT.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.105
RAVEN: OH, COME ON.

36:06.425 --> 36:09.297
IT WORKED.
WE'RE GONNA BE OK.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.299
NOW GET OUT OF THERE!

36:16.043 --> 36:17.958
HATCH: YOU'RE WELCOME.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.948
OH, GOD.

36:54.864 --> 36:57.432
I DID THIS.

36:57.476 --> 37:01.262
YEAH, YOU DID.

37:01.306 --> 37:02.742
HOW THE MIGHTY
HAVE FALLEN.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.877
WELCOME TO THE WORLD
OF GRAY.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.186
NIKKI: WHAT THE HELL
IS TAKING SO LONG?

37:17.844 --> 37:19.628
YOU SAID THIS WAS SAFE.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.893
HE TRUSTED YOU.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.373
AAH! AAH!

37:25.417 --> 37:26.853
LIAR!

37:28.246 --> 37:29.682
HEY, HEY!

37:29.725 --> 37:31.292
NIKKI: MURDERER!
EMORI: GET OFF HER!

37:31.336 --> 37:32.772
MURPHY: LISTEN.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

37:32.815 --> 37:34.295
BUT THIS SOLVES NOTHING.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.036
-STOP!
-YOU SHOULD DIE FOR THIS!

37:36.079 --> 37:37.733
AAH!

37:37.777 --> 37:39.257
NIKKI: I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
MURPHY: STOP! STOP!

37:39.300 --> 37:41.215
LEAVE HER ALONE!

37:43.826 --> 37:46.002
BACK OFF!

37:46.046 --> 37:48.266
TRAITORS!
SHE KILLED HIM!

37:48.309 --> 37:51.138
LET ME GO! AAH!

37:51.181 --> 37:53.271
YOU MURDERER!

37:53.314 --> 37:55.229
MURPHY: COME ON.
WE GOT TO GET YOU
TO MEDICAL.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.709
LET GO OF ME.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.429
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.433
IS MADI OK?

38:27.087 --> 38:31.004
I THINK SHE'S RELIEVED.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.355
BEING COMMANDER BROUGHT
HER SO MUCH PAIN.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.531
AND NOW SHE WON'T
HAVE TO PRETEND
ANYMORE.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.101
YOU OK?

38:46.193 --> 38:47.760
WHEN I BECAME
A FLEIMKEPA SCOUT,

38:47.803 --> 38:51.111
I WAS--I WAS SO YOUNG,

38:51.154 --> 38:56.899
SO, UH, ANGRY
AT MY MOTHER.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.858
IN TRAINING,
THEY TAUGHT THAT

38:58.901 --> 39:02.514
YOU MUST DEVOTE
YOURSELF TO THE FLAME.

39:02.557 --> 39:06.866
ALL WORLDLY CONCERNS
FALL AWAY.

39:06.909 --> 39:11.174
YOU CAN HAVE
NO OTHER LOYALTY.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.916
SOUNDS LONELY.

39:13.960 --> 39:18.965
IT WAS,
BUT I HAD MY FAITH.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.836
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I HAVE.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.582
ARE YOU OK?

39:30.324 --> 39:33.371
I REALIZED NO MATTER
WHAT WE DO TO HELP

39:33.414 --> 39:37.418
IT ALWAYS ENDS
THE SAME.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.247
I USED TO THINK FIGHTING
IS WHAT WE DO.

39:43.250 --> 39:47.297
NOW I WORRY THAT
FIGHTING IS WHAT WE ARE.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.908
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE.

39:48.951 --> 39:51.911
I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT,

39:51.954 --> 39:54.566
BUT WE KEEP ENDING UP
IN THE SAME PLACE,

39:54.609 --> 39:57.264
AND EVERY TIME,
PEOPLE DIE.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.137
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
ANYONE ELSE.

40:09.102 --> 40:12.540
AHH.

40:12.584 --> 40:16.414
IS SOMETHING WRONG,
DOCTOR?

40:18.938 --> 40:22.594
DO YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE KILLED?

40:22.637 --> 40:25.423
MY LIST OF REGRETS
IS LONG.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.559
HOW IS HE?

40:31.603 --> 40:33.126
ALIVE.

40:33.169 --> 40:35.433
FOR NOW ANYWAY.

40:35.476 --> 40:39.262
THE PYRE AWAITS.

40:39.306 --> 40:40.916
IF YOU DIE, YOUR
PEOPLE WILL BURN

40:40.960 --> 40:42.483
SANCTUM TO THE GROUND.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.006
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

40:44.050 --> 40:48.228
TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE
THE FORCES TO STOP IT.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.838
YOU THINK I DIDN'T
NOTICE THAT SOME

40:49.882 --> 40:51.884
OF MY GUARDS ARE GONE?

40:51.927 --> 40:53.842
YOUR BELIEVERS
STILL WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU ARE.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.496
THEY'VE LOST FAITH
IN JORDAN,

40:55.540 --> 40:57.063
BUT HE TELLS ME ONE
