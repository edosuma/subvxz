00:02.252 --> 00:03.503
- Previously on Haven...

00:03.629 --> 00:05.085
FBI! Who are you?
- Haven PD! Who are you?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.329
- FBI. Are you deaf?

00:06.465 --> 00:07.671
[door slams]

00:07.799 --> 00:09.630
Oh! I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.751
- It's all right.
I didn't feel it.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.844
- So you seriously
can't feel pain?

00:14.973 --> 00:16.133
- No.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.381
- You must be Duke.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.633
- I don't talk to cops,

00:18.769 --> 00:20.134
even cops that I like.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.477
- I know that picture.
- You do?

00:22.606 --> 00:24.221
- Colorado Kid murder.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.770
She looks like you.
- Yeah, I know.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.268
This isn't the first weird thing
I've seen in Haven, Nathan,

00:29.404 --> 00:31.360
and I've only
been here a week.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.615
So just--can you tell me
what's going on?

00:35.744 --> 00:38.281
- Every town's got
a few skeletons in the closet.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.246
- Well, this is
a big freakin' closet.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.366
Your father
just offered me a job.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.662
- What'd you say?

00:44.795 --> 00:48.083
- I said
that I would think it over.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.955
- Might be a good idea.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.583
- The troubles, you're afraid
they're coming back?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.834
- No.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.507
They are back.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.051
And I'm afraid
they won't go away this time.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.603
[classical music playing]

01:12.739 --> 01:16.152
- Hey, babe, um,
I just fixed that hatch.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.525
The Caprice is almost ready

01:17.661 --> 01:19.071
to get back out
on that high seas.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.616
Maybe one day,
you and me can--

01:21.748 --> 01:23.033
can motor out
to Seal Island, huh?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.747
- [banging on piano]

01:24.876 --> 01:26.787
- It's okay. It's okay.
- How you doing, Ray?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.161
- Tired.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.254
I'm good. I'm fine.
Thanks.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.589
- You hang in there,
all right?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.208
- Okay, Lilly,
I'm gonna go home,

01:34.344 --> 01:36.130
but I'll see you
next week.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.595
- Ready?
And one, two...

01:38.724 --> 01:40.555
- HoW's William this morning?
- Three.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.767
Oh, he's a regular LeBron James
today, aren't you, William?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.305
- The doc's gonna administer.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.680
Help me with the lunches?
- Yeah, okay.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.442
-Mmm!
Chicken salad today.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.440
- Yeah, they eat well.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.192
Better than me.
- Yeah, they have to.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.115
Need a full stomach
to tolerate that medicine.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.908
[glass shatters]
- Damn it!

02:12.716 --> 02:14.877
- That's not good.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.170
Let me help you with that.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.543
- No!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.340
You're contaminating
everything!

02:24.686 --> 02:26.347
- Oh, my God!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.101
- Nice work on the cat lady call
this morning.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.359
- Who knew I had such talent

02:31.485 --> 02:32.850
with drunken women
in housecoats?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.101
- Not me.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.363
- Oh, and I did
a pretty good job

02:35.489 --> 02:36.854
with that angry fisherman dude.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.150
- Once you got his pants on.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.194
- [laughs]
Yeah, that helped.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.363
- Life of a local cop.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.657
- Hey, remember,
I'm on loan.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.281
- You'll stay.
- Oh, you think so?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.373
- Best way to find out
if your mother came through here

02:49.503 --> 02:51.118
is to be a local cop,

02:51.254 --> 02:53.245
unless you're ready to give
that investigation up.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.213
- You know I'm not.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.674
I just thought
that when l was in Haven,

02:57.803 --> 02:59.043
the cases would be more...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.386
- Troubling.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.506
I get it.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.928
Well, we'll see
more of that soon.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.015
But, you know,
don't underestimate

03:09.147 --> 03:10.478
your skills
with the small stuff.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.972
- Skills?

03:12.109 --> 03:13.565
- A local cop probably
wouldn't have put

03:13.694 --> 03:14.900
all the cats in the same box.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.768
- I only had one box.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.111
And anyways, they all fit.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.323
- Next time,
maybe just look around.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.736
- Why, did I miss something?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.325
- Mrs. Nelson's
fourth grade class

03:24.454 --> 03:25.785
watching you
from the school.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.826
- Oh, God, do you think
I scarred them?

03:28.959 --> 03:32.247
- I think they laughed
their fourth grade asses off.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.745
- Nathan,
are you there, hon?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.460
- Go ahead, Laverne.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.380
- Got a call about a disturbance
at the Freddy.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.628
- We're on our way.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.300
- What's a Freddy?

03:44.433 --> 03:46.389
You're kidding me.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.554
Haven has
a mental hospital?

03:48.687 --> 03:52.054
That's a grain of sand
at the beach.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.101
Who's Murray Q. Frederikson?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.895
- A respected local car dealer,

03:56.027 --> 03:59.110
till one day, he announced
he could breathe like a fish

03:59.239 --> 04:00.979
and disappeared
under the sea.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.947
- Let me guess.
Was that during the troubles?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.237
- Nope.
He was just crazy.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.201
His wife founded the Freddy
with his estate.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.490
- Thank God you're here!
- Whoa!

04:08.623 --> 04:09.954
[woman screams]

04:10.083 --> 04:12.244
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.288
l was in the kitchen.
I heard screaming.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.706
I went into the common room.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.579
Dr. Lucassi's medicine
was all over.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.297
Morgan's in there
trying to calm everyb--

04:19.426 --> 04:21.291
[glass shatters]
- Whoa!

04:21.428 --> 04:22.634
[woman screams]

04:22.763 --> 04:24.469
- Oh!

04:24.598 --> 04:27.465
- Laverne, we need backup
and a medic at the Freddy now.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.966
- What's going on, hon?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.309
- The patients
have taken over the asylum.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.803
- Morgan?
- Where are the doctors?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.600
Who's in charge?
- Him.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.101
That's Dr. Lucassi.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.821
[dramatic music]

04:50.957 --> 04:58.955
J‘J‘

05:38.380 --> 05:40.086
- Okay, come on,
just keep coming this way.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.582
- He's no bored housewife.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.629
We can't shoot the doctor.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.548
- No.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.637
- And we can't go
in that room.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.881
- [groans]

05:51.017 --> 05:53.554
-So...

05:53.687 --> 05:56.019
why are we
sneaking up on him?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.229
- Because Haven
doesn't have a SWAT team.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.191
It has a dispatch lady
that calls you hon.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.275
So we're following
FBI protocol.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.521
- [yelling]
- What's that?

06:05.657 --> 06:08.490
- Engage the suspect verbally,
attenuate, and mitigate.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.950
- Talk to him?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.364
- Yeah.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.953
- Hmm, great.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.913
- Dr. Lucassi,
this is FBI Agent--

06:16.042 --> 06:17.248
[loud crash]

06:17.377 --> 06:19.789
- Go away!
I have work to do!

06:21.548 --> 06:23.630
- Plan B.
- So much work to do!

06:23.758 --> 06:24.918
- You think we could, uh--

06:25.051 --> 06:26.882
think we could Taser him?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.219
- Don't think a Taser
will reach.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.338
- [yelling]

06:32.767 --> 06:34.632
- And given that,

06:34.769 --> 06:36.851
I'm winging it.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.513
Okay.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.100
- Ether?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.064
[glass shatters]

06:48.867 --> 06:49.982
- [coughing]

06:50.118 --> 06:51.949
- Impressive.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.160
- [coughing]

06:54.289 --> 06:55.529
[glass shatters]

06:55.665 --> 06:57.951
[coughing]

07:00.670 --> 07:02.285
- Got the doctor contained
in the Freddy

07:02.422 --> 07:03.923
pending medical's arrival.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.664
We need A.J.
to come take a sample

07:05.800 --> 07:07.791
and see if Millikin
can salvage anything

07:07.928 --> 07:11.295
off the security cameras
before they were trashed.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.967
- All right,
she did a patient head count.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.635
- We lose any?
- Three.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.304
And we need
to get to them immediately.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.176
- Dr. Lucassi's
a good man.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.804
He's a little intense,
but he wouldn't hurt a fly.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.023
- The three that escaped,
they were in the room with him

07:23.151 --> 07:24.482
when the jungle juice
spilled.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.476
- If it did to them
what it did to him...

07:26.613 --> 07:29.320
- Yeah, but do you really think
that a drug spill could do this?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.155
- Well, seen worse.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.575
I went to college.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.123
Okay, what are you thinking?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.788
- That guy looked different.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.036
- Different how?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.378
- Different like a...

07:45.507 --> 07:47.338
like a special blend
of Haven crazy.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.128
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.000
You like it.
- Like what?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.468
- The weirdness.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.258
You hope it's something weird.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.006
That's why you're still here.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.303
- No, I'm still here
because a woman who was here

07:58.436 --> 08:00.643
could have been my mom,
and I'd like to find out.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.137
- Uh-huh. Right.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.013
And you run around
in the Mystery Machine...

08:04.150 --> 08:05.560
- Wait, Nathan.
- Are you there, hon?

08:05.694 --> 08:07.275
Prowlers reported
to be pilfering items

08:07.404 --> 08:09.861
off the laundry line,
including two pairs of shorts,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.696
four socks,
and two gray sweatshirts...

08:11.825 --> 08:13.565
- What might
escaped mental patients need?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.444
- A T-shirt and, oh,
one floppy hat.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.319
- Oh.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.614
- Thank God!

08:20.750 --> 08:21.865
They're still here!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.789
They have my son
in the back!

08:24.921 --> 08:28.505
[laughter]

08:32.679 --> 08:34.260
- Oh, hello, there!

08:34.389 --> 08:36.755
William's always been
a bit of a child at heart.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.223
I could do that, too,
if I was young and fit

08:39.352 --> 08:41.388
and him.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.514
[laughing]

08:55.035 --> 08:57.947
- Vegetables, fruit...

08:58.079 --> 08:59.194
- Lilly.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.241
- Ah!
Eggs”.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.365
- What the hell?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.207
Those twits.
How did you get out?

09:05.336 --> 09:08.954
- Hey, Ray.
What's with this fridge?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.963
12 beer, two ketchups,
and zero veggies?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.427
That's not gonna help
with your cholesterol, love.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.097
Ray?
You okay?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.344
- Yeah, yeah.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.973
Um...are you?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.315
- Yeah, I think so.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.650
It's weird.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.440
I was just walking
down Harkness.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.483
Was I in the hospital?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.818
- You...were.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.865
How are you feeling now?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.114
- A bit spacey but fine.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.456
Hungry.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.247
- Okay.
I'll make us some...

09:49.923 --> 09:52.630
[sighs]

09:52.759 --> 09:56.092
Nothing.
Got nothing.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.961
- That's okay.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.464
Maybe start
with a hello kiss.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.819
Hello.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.686
- Hi.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.877
[men speaking indistinctly]

10:32.006 --> 10:33.507
- So you're a florist.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.339
- Uh-huh.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.460
And this part of the northeast
is great for flowering vines.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.805
This beautiful flower
is a Wisteria sinensis.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.174
Spectacular plant.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.846
- Cool.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.273
What?

10:52.402 --> 10:53.517
- I remember...

10:53.653 --> 10:56.611
Gerbera daisies,

10:56.739 --> 11:00.106
snapdragons,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.700
orchids.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.865
- Okay.
Nathan?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.989
Nathan,
can I have some help here?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.700
- Whoa.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.451
Busy.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.374
Wait. Stop.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.962
- Oh.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.207
- Hey, what do you think
happened to these guys?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.301
- The excess saliva's
completely normal.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.840
It's a side effect
of his meds.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.515
Although he might be dehydrated.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.306
- Uh...are you okay?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.600
Because you weren't
a few minutes ago.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.564
- I feel fine.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.059
Though I shudder to think
what behavior got me here.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.188
William needs my help.
Can you unstrap me?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.030
-Uh...

11:43.953 --> 11:46.444
All right, go ahead.
Just”

11:46.581 --> 11:47.821
Yeah.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.412
Thank you.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.169
- Why are these men here?

11:55.298 --> 11:56.879
- Well, we're just
bringing them back.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.714
You know, they had
a trampoline playdate.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.255
- These two men
are stage three catatonics.

12:01.387 --> 12:05.255
Mr. Sperry hasn't spoken
or moved in 16 years.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.598
- Well, he was fine
up until a moment ago.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.842
You, not so much.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.934
- Doctor,
there was a spill.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.100
- Maybe it made them better

12:13.233 --> 12:14.814
and you...worse.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.184
- And oddly stronger.
- What was I doing?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.605
- You were ranting
about your work.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.103
- And contamination.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.777
- I am somewhat obsessive
about cleanliness.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.365
Perhaps whatever happened

12:24.494 --> 12:26.951
amplified my predilections
and removed inhibitions.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.992
Although I can't imagine
my drugs doing that.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.706
- At least everyone's
back the way they were.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.578
- Um, Lilly
is still out there.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.625
- Is she a catatonic?
- No.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.965
But she can be violent,

12:41.094 --> 12:42.755
extremely so.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.343
Lilly was a musician.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.937
And now she has
a grand mal obsessive disorder--

12:55.066 --> 12:57.603
akin to a PTSD,
only worse.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.441
- Is that
why she was committed?

12:59.570 --> 13:01.856
- When she feels
the music is...

13:01.990 --> 13:04.026
escaping her,

13:04.158 --> 13:07.821
she gets extremely frustrated
and destructive.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.706
- Ray McBreen?

13:10.832 --> 13:12.163
- Ah, Dr. Lucassi.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.032
l was wondering
when you were gonna show.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.456
Whatever you did for Lilly,
thank you.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.964
- She's okay?

13:19.090 --> 13:22.628
- She's great.
Come on in.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.302
LHILove?

13:28.558 --> 13:29.968
Damn it.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.804
- She must have
changed back.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.052
- How?
She was fine!

13:34.188 --> 13:35.769
- I don't know...yet.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.513
- Any idea
where she could have gone?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.480
- If she's back
the way she was--

13:41.612 --> 13:43.227
anyplace with a piano.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.524
- Why?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.318
- She wants to compose music.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.487
- Okay, let's find her.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.702
- Wait, Nathan.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.698
make sure it's causing it.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.870
- And if it isn't,
then what?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.210
- It's a simple test.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.751
- Okay, you two do that.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.373
- Yeah.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.500
- We'll find her.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.390
Why pianos?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.554
- She liked to compose on them.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.143
Said they felt right.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.479
- Ray?
- I don't want to talk about it.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.189
- Ray, talk to me.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.405
- Lilly--
Lilly loves writing music.

14:27.533 --> 14:32.323
One day, a music exec
heard one of her songs.

14:32.455 --> 14:36.494
Said if she could write another,
we had a big contract.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.164
She wanted it--
she wanted it perfect.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.957
I did too.

14:42.090 --> 14:46.254
I talked her into driving up
to her favorite composing place.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.923
We were so excited,
I got distracted

14:49.055 --> 14:53.219
and drove off the road
into the Penobscot River.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.848
I barely made it out alive.

14:57.980 --> 15:03.065
Took me another eight minutes
to get her out.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.025
Well, they said that
if the water wasn't so cold,

15:05.154 --> 15:07.065
she would have been
brain-dead.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.612
Instead she's...

15:11.744 --> 15:13.575
- Like she is.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.202
- Because of me.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.044
- Officer,

15:24.173 --> 15:26.255
have you ever had
a family member

15:26.384 --> 15:29.672
fade away
because of Alzheimer's?

15:29.804 --> 15:31.669
l have.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.718
Cruel doesn't begin
to describe it.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.637
I'd like to stop that.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.806
Identical volume
and concentration.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.806
Pray we get a measurable delta
in wattage.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.807
- Measurable delta
in wattage?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.152
- Flesh and electricity,
that's what we are.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.567
Of course, I'm sure there are
some unmeasurable energies,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.157
like our soul.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.151
- Oh, you believe in that?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.529
- A few centuries ago,
the world's best scientists

15:57.665 --> 16:00.782
were convinced
that the Earth was flat.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.704
Everything they saw about it
was flat.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.997
But was it?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.540
No.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.788
They were just afraid

16:06.924 --> 16:10.212
to open their eyes
and sail.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.754
Could you get me
those safety goggles

16:11.888 --> 16:13.128
out there, please?

16:19.020 --> 16:22.103
- Wait!
What are you doing?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.062
- Scientific method.
- Get out of there!

16:24.192 --> 16:28.401
- Calculated risk is critical
to great discoveries.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.986
[glass shatters]

16:31.115 --> 16:33.527
- Doctor, you need
to get out of there!

16:33.659 --> 16:36.651
[instrument beeping]

16:43.085 --> 16:45.701
- Why isn't this working?
What's different?

16:52.470 --> 16:55.052
- J‘ Farewell and adieu
to you J‘

16:55.181 --> 16:56.637
- Where'd you get that?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.927
- Came with the Happy Meal.
- Yeah, right.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.721
- All right, you caught me.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.845
Ah, Nate, the Scupper
was giving it away.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.188
I was gonna use it
to decorate the boat.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.774
Now, do I need a permit
for that, Officer,

17:08.903 --> 17:11.235
or is it gonna be okay?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.279
You know
what's amazing, Nate?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.248
Is that you get a badge,
you get to harass me.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.369
- Because you're
a lowlife criminal.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.670
- I'm gonna check inside.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.588
- New partner?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.675
I don't know.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.176
I kind of liked
the old one better.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.598
Let me ask you something.
Does she...

17:45.731 --> 17:51.271
I mean, does she know
you're not a...

17:51.404 --> 17:52.644
a real boy?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.114
I mean, does she know
about the things you've done?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.740
- Hey.
She's here.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.910
- Have a nice day, Nate.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.967
- This is what we got
off the security camera.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.016
- Okay, this should be
the spill.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.727
- Hmm.

18:30.860 --> 18:34.773
- It's like ljust dropped it,
like I felt something.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.897
- Okay, let's rewind it
to right before the spill.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.987
There.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.987
Wait.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.205
Is that William?

18:46.334 --> 18:49.542
He's--he's already
holding the ball.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.421
Nathan, whatever caused it
happened before the spill.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.918
It was something
invisible.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.420
- Okay.
Listen--

19:00.556 --> 19:01.887
- I don't know
if it was a gas or a virus

19:02.016 --> 19:03.677
or if it was something weird,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.845
but when we checked the tape,
we figured that it was--

19:05.978 --> 19:08.845
- Audrey,
we found Lilly.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.017
[soft piano notes]

19:11.150 --> 19:12.765
- How is she?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.564
- She's trying
to play the piano.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.937
Can't get it out of neutral,
though.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.860
- Let's get you back
to the Freddy, baby.

19:19.992 --> 19:27.990
J‘J‘

19:49.480 --> 19:52.472
- [grunting]

19:54.610 --> 19:55.850
[woman screams]

19:58.197 --> 20:00.779
- lt's...contagious?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.148
- [yells]

20:02.284 --> 20:03.865
- How is this spreading?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.162
- Nathan?
Are you in there?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.996
Nathan.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.616
Nathan, what happened?
Where--

20:13.713 --> 20:14.919
Hey, where's Ray and Lilly?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.878
What's going on here?
Nathan!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.091
Did you call
for backup?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.480
Nathan.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.234
Nathan, d--

20:41.407 --> 20:43.489
Oh, crap.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.280
- Nothing.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.748
- Oh, Nathan.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.413
What are you talking about?

20:54.545 --> 20:56.877
Whoa!

20:59.383 --> 21:00.714
- We've rounded up
the party boys.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.834
I'm still trying
to get a line on Nathan.

21:02.970 --> 21:07.054
- All right, we got to find out
what's causing this.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.139
- I can only think
of one common denominator.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.383
- What?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.350
- Not what, who.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.309
- Lilly.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.151
- Audrey, are you there, honey?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.067
I got a 20 on Nathan's car.
He's down at the marina.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.781
- Great.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.832
- [scoffs]
Look, Nathan.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.675
You may want to consider
switching to decaf, buddy.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.675
- What's it feel like--

21:51.811 --> 21:53.051
the sun?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.685
- Feels good.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.394
Hey!
What are you doing?

22:03.531 --> 22:05.487
- What's it like
to feel this?

22:05.616 --> 22:08.653
You talk about
the things I've done?

22:08.786 --> 22:10.868
It's nothing compared
to the things you've done!

22:10.996 --> 22:12.987
- Who?
- The things you still do!

22:14.750 --> 22:16.490
To me!

22:22.675 --> 22:25.166
['l'aser crackling]

22:34.353 --> 22:36.093
- Sorry I had to do that,
Nathan.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.640
Are you okay?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.388
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.231
- l was talking
to Nathan.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.653
- Nothing.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.022
Felt nothing.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.574
- What's going on?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.785
- I need you
to keep him here.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.574
- No.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.288
- He's sick, Duke.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.075
- I knew that.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.371
- This is different, all right?

23:00.504 --> 23:01.664
Something--

23:01.797 --> 23:03.879
something
just happened to him.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.800
- Is he contagious?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.305
I'm just asking.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.171
- No, I don't know,
all right?

23:12.308 --> 23:13.514
But I know someone who is,

23:13.642 --> 23:15.018
and if I don't
get to her soon,

23:15.144 --> 23:17.055
she's gonna make
more like him.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.768
Okay, so I got to go.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.604
- I'm not...

23:20.733 --> 23:23.816
- This is the part where you
come through for me, right?

23:23.944 --> 23:26.481
Remember who kept you
from going to jail?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.827
- l was having
such a nice day.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.450
- Officer Parker,
it's Dr. Lucassi.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.123
Any luck finding Lilly?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.631
- Not yet.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.294
Hey, can I
ask you something?

23:47.426 --> 23:50.293
When it all happened,
was Lilly playing the piano?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.545
- Yes, I seem to recall her

23:52.681 --> 23:54.296
actually starting
to play something.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.548
Why do you ask?

23:55.684 --> 23:56.890
- Well, according to Nathan,

23:57.019 --> 23:58.555
she was playing
at the Shiny Scupper too

23:58.687 --> 23:59.972
or, at least, you know,
trying to.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.481
- And?

24:01.607 --> 24:03.222
- At least
it's a common denominator.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.977
You know, I, uh--l want
to take a look at her room.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.990
[yelling]

24:13.118 --> 24:15.450
[laughing]

24:17.957 --> 24:19.288
Let me go.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.997
- I don't think so.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.411
You're on a time-out.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.964
- [groaning]

24:37.726 --> 24:39.808
- What the hell
happened to you?

24:41.522 --> 24:43.103
Right.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.188
You keep doing that,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.355
I forgot.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.695
You're special.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.030
Can't hurt you.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.023
- At least
I'm not a parasite.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.573
[laughing]

24:58.706 --> 25:00.571
- That's a good one.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.496
- Just using people...

25:07.631 --> 25:09.542
Like you always do.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.667
Are you planning
on using Audrey too?

25:12.803 --> 25:14.384
Hmm?
[laughs]

25:14.513 --> 25:15.844
Of course you are.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.509
Course you are.
It's what you do.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.305
[laughs]

25:28.193 --> 25:31.981
You can't hurt me,
remember?

25:38.203 --> 25:40.455
- I think they might be
hiding out on Ray's boat.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.698
It's called
the Caprice.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.626
Huh.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.622
All right, thank you.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.749
It's not berthed
in any of the local marinas.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.467
I'm kind of surprised that
he can own this nice of a boat.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.427
- Well, from what he's told me
during his visits,

25:57.556 --> 25:59.763
his grandfather abandoned it
when the McBreen family

25:59.892 --> 26:01.132
washed up in Haven years ago.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.428
[cell phone rings]

26:02.561 --> 26:04.426
- Sorry.
Excuse me.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.599
- No problem; I'll see
if I can locate the boat.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.017
- Okay.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.765
Hello?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.689
- Yeah,
Sleeping Beauty just woke up,

26:12.821 --> 26:16.063
and I'm all done
playing Prince Charming.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.618
- Caught it,
didn't I?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.992
- How are you feeling?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.620
- I'm not sure
which is worse:

26:31.757 --> 26:35.716
going crazy
or being sane afterwards.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.836
- What do you remember?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.098
- Shiny Scupper.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.339
That's it.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.682
- Lilly was playing
the piano there.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.353
- Yeah.
Why?

26:48.482 --> 26:50.473
- I think her music
is causing this.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.021
- No, I don't think so.
- No, come on, Nathan.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.314
This is notjust me being
excited over the weirdness.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.689
- I didn't say it was.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.533
I just don't think it's Lilly
who's causing this.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.653
- Why?

27:03.789 --> 27:05.245
- Ray sat down next to her
at the piano,

27:05.374 --> 27:07.160
and he started to play.

27:07.292 --> 27:11.080
- Wait.
Ray did?

27:13.423 --> 27:15.880
- I got some music
for the trip:

27:16.009 --> 27:19.422
Aretha at the Fillmore
with Ray Charles,

27:19.555 --> 27:21.762
Spirit in the Dark.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.759
- Ray?

27:28.522 --> 27:30.183
What happened
to those people at the bar?

27:30.315 --> 27:33.478
That was awful.
Did I do that?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.316
- You?
No. No.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.481
- Did you?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.650
Oh, my God, Ray!

27:39.783 --> 27:41.489
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.030
You can't keep doing that.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.873
- Of course.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.662
Ray was at the Freddy.
I saw him on the tape.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.376
He must be the one
who changed all these people,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.837
but he left so fast
that he didn't even realize it.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.379
- Pretty sure he knows
what he's doing now.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.047
- Lil,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.091
I won't lose you again.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.554
- I don't want
to hurt people.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.548
- I don't want
to hurt people either.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.349
All right?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.713
- No word
on Lilly or Ray.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.924
I guess we got to go find
the Caprice.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.294
- I know
where the boat is.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.421
- Great.
Where?

28:45.557 --> 28:46.797
- I'll take you to her.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.720
- No.
It's just us.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.136
- Oh.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.682
Okay, forget it.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.936
we could throw you in jail.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.775
- No, you can't.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.520
And, frankly, I'm getting
a little sick of the threat.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.147
Considering
that a police officer

29:03.283 --> 29:04.489
just attacked me...

29:04.618 --> 29:06.950
- Mr. Crocker?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.161
I encourage you
to file a complaint

29:09.289 --> 29:11.780
and press charges.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.746
- [sighs]

29:16.546 --> 29:18.002
Not my style, Nathan.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.258
- Why exactly
do you want to come?

29:20.384 --> 29:23.501
- 'Cause I'm
a good citizen.

29:23.637 --> 29:28.051
And I want to know what
the hell's going on around here.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.641
- Okay, that should get
that head working,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.813
at least until we get
out of here.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.356
- [humming]

29:42.489 --> 29:44.980
- Damn.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.402
Hang in there, babe.
Hang in there.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.275
I'll get you out
in a jiff.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.659
[soft guitar music]

29:56.795 --> 30:04.793
J‘J‘

30:34.833 --> 30:36.289
There you are.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.500
- Hey, Ray.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.754
- It's you.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.874
- No!

30:45.010 --> 30:46.671
- No, no, no, no.
I'm coming.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.839
- No, the deal was, you have
to do exactly what we say.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.303
And I'm saying stay here.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.388
- Wait.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.178
- And the people
from the Scupper

30:54.311 --> 30:56.597
got better at exactly
the same time you did.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.345
- So people
who hear Ray together

30:58.482 --> 30:59.813
are affected
for the same duration.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.442
- Yeah, but you were gone
for two hours,

31:01.568 --> 31:03.479
and the people from the Freddy
were gone for four.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.193
- So what makes it shorter?

31:05.322 --> 31:09.281
- No, the better question is,
what makes it longer?

31:09.409 --> 31:12.901
- Okay, now I wish
Haven had a SWAT team.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.448
Whoa.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.744
Down. Down.
Down! Down.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.960
So what happened?

31:22.089 --> 31:24.705
- Lucassi overpowered Ray,
threw him in the car,

31:24.841 --> 31:27.093
and said something
about getting him back.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.886
Okay, you keep her here
until we call you.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.755
- Okay, you're taking
this good citizen thing

31:33.892 --> 31:35.553
way too literally!

31:37.437 --> 31:40.395
We're staying here, okay?

31:40.524 --> 31:42.560
- Lilly's sure
Lucassi came here?

31:42.692 --> 31:43.977
- Where else would he go?

31:44.111 --> 31:46.272
Since he knows
what Ray can do.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.896
Nathan, Lucassi
wants to help his patients

31:49.032 --> 31:50.192
more than anything.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.826
He's a good doctor.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.443
- And, presently,
crazier than an outhouse rat.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.412
- Yeah, well,
then there's that.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.452
You know, it might work.
- What?

31:59.584 --> 32:01.370
- The doctor using Ray
to help his patients--

32:01.503 --> 32:03.619
I mean, if he can manage him,
keep him safe.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.370
- That's a big if.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.543
Take it from a guy
who caught the funk.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.427
- You're right.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.548
[saw whirring]

32:18.019 --> 32:20.010
We might have
a problem.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.150
- Stop.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.652
This is sterile.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.280
- Okay. Okay.
Just--

32:40.417 --> 32:42.248
Doctor?

32:42.377 --> 32:43.537
Don't do this.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.661
- Do you realize
what this man can do?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.173
- Yes, yes.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.506
- I need his brain.

32:49.634 --> 32:52.967
This--this--this--

32:53.096 --> 32:54.597
this is a whole new world.

32:54.723 --> 32:58.511
- You're right.
We do need to understand him.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.385
- If we can.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.806
If we can.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.315
Been exploring the brain
for 20 years.

We can spare--we can spare
the families the pain

33:13.992 --> 33:17.200
of watching their loved ones
fade away to a--

33:22.542 --> 33:25.158
- You're getting good
at that.

33:25.295 --> 33:28.207
- Electricity:
it did--did wonders on you.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.046
- Uh-huh.

33:48.318 --> 33:52.106
- Ray,
I'm changing back.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.695
-lneed
a musical instrument.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.109
- No!
No music.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.358
- Lil.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.609
- No.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.736
- Why?
- Why?

34:00.872 --> 34:04.205
You were tied up, with a guy
about to open your head.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.575
I can't have you risking
your life, other people's lives.

34:06.711 --> 34:10.044
It's too much.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.288
- We can get a cabin.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.085
- It's all too risky.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.756
- No, no, no.
Baby.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.628
I don't care.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.426
I don't want to lose you.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.688
- Promise.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.559
Promise me.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.658
J‘ Now I'm decided J‘

35:06.104 --> 35:10.518
J‘ Maybe, maybe J‘

35:10.650 --> 35:14.984
Maybe, maybe,
maybe a chance.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.958
- When did it all start?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.832
- I don't know.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.505
I stopped playing everything
when Lilly got sick.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.424
Didn't have it in me.

35:41.556 --> 35:46.767
Freddy was the first time
I played in forever.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.602
Didn't used to be
that way.

35:49.731 --> 35:53.599
- So is that
your grandfather's boat?

35:53.735 --> 35:55.521
- Yeah.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.485
He came here on it.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.359
You know, he always told me
to stay away from music.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.907
I think--

36:07.040 --> 36:10.624
I think he knew.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.743
I just thought
he hated rock and roll.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.790
- Doctor, if the goal
is safety through solitude,

36:17.926 --> 36:19.757
wouldn't a small boat
on the ocean

36:19.886 --> 36:21.797
be an acceptable risk?

36:21.930 --> 36:23.136
- Yes.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.845
- Okay, Doctor,
Ray is special--

36:24.974 --> 36:26.839
- I'm aware
of Mr. McBreen's condition.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.807
And you're right.
He is special.

36:28.937 --> 36:32.680
- Yeah, but he's also just a man
who wants to be with his wife.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.233
So if we just let them
go on the boat,

36:37.362 --> 36:39.819
maybe that's
the right thing to do.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.563
Maybe that's
where he should be,

36:41.700 --> 36:43.782
and maybe there,
he would discover that--

36:43.910 --> 36:46.026
- That the Earth
isn't flat?

36:58.007 --> 37:00.293

37:44.804 --> 37:46.886

Good thing you're staying here.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.380
- Yeah.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.381
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

37:50.518 --> 37:53.180
- With this crack crew?

37:53.313 --> 37:54.803
We'll be fine.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.270
Brought a lot
of instruments.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.685
- Yeah, as long as you play them
way out at sea.

37:58.818 --> 37:59.978
- Yup.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.567
And when it's safe,

38:01.696 --> 38:03.436
we'll take short trips
back to the shore,

38:03.573 --> 38:04.983
maybe help some other people,

38:08.912 --> 38:10.777
Thank you.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.779
- You're welcome.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.998
All right!

- I wanted to apologize to you.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.669
- Yeah?
For?

38:19.798 --> 38:23.165
- For gaping at you
like a schoolboy.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.792
It's just,
you are the spitting image

38:25.929 --> 38:28.511
of someone I sold flowers to
years ago.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.050
- Who?

38:33.186 --> 38:39.147
- Daisies, snapdragons,
and orchids.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.357
I remember flowers,
not names.

38:41.486 --> 38:45.024
- All right, me mateys!
Cast ofﬂ

38:49.369 --> 38:51.155
- I believe it was.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.493
- Wait.
What was her name?

38:52.622 --> 38:54.158
- I don't know.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.121
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, please, please.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.991
Just--can you think?

39:02.173 --> 39:05.711
- Lucy.
I believe it was Lucy.

39:26.823 --> 39:30.065
- You're not gonna
tell anyone, right?

39:30.201 --> 39:32.066
- Hmm?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.444
- About me being
a good citizen.

39:34.581 --> 39:37.493
- Oh, no.

39:37.625 --> 39:41.459
No, your secret's
safe with me.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.751
Thanks.
Thanks for helping.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.091
- Oh, I'm gonna send you
and Nathan a bill.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.084
I charge double
for night work.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.177
- [chuckles]

39:54.601 --> 39:56.387
- I'm glad
that I could help.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.313
Troubles are back,
aren't they?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.939
- Yeah, I think so.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.249
Lucy.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.761
The lady in the picture,

40:33.890 --> 40:35.221
it's Lucy.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.965
Mr. Sperry told me.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.308
- Lucy.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.019
Well, that's a start.

40:42.148 --> 40:44.685
- Yeah.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.609
Okay, you know what?
I admit it.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.354
This weird stuff,
it kind of does turn me on.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.981
- You want to fix them.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.233
- No, they're just cases.

40:55.370 --> 40:59.784
They're really,
really interesting cases.

40:59.916 --> 41:03.704
- Well, maybe
you'll fix me someday.

41:03.836 --> 41:07.249
- I don't think so.
Nobody can fix you.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.838
- Nathan, where are you, love?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.332
Dr. Lucassi called.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.299
More shenanigans
up at the Freddy.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.680
Three patients
have gone missing.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.171
- I think you better go
check that out.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.889
- Yeah, yeah.
That place, it's crazy.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.883
They really got
to get their act together.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.764
- J‘ A chance to dream J‘

41:25.900 --> 41:29.188
J‘ I've waited J‘

41:29.320 --> 41:33.029
J‘ A lifetime for maybe J‘

41:33.157 --> 41:36.866
J‘ A chance to dream J‘
