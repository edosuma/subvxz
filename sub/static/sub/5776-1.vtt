- Hello, Murphy.
- You're late for the ceremony.

01:54.170 --> 01:56.380
- Still up in the squad room?
- Yeah.

01:58.930 --> 02:02.140
Lieutenant Thomas will be in charge
of this precinct...

02:05.810 --> 02:07.860
...and no-one else.

02:07.980 --> 02:12.400
So far as you are concerned,
he has no superiors.

02:13.690 --> 02:16.310
You'll give him your co-operation...

02:17.030 --> 02:18.990
and your obedience,

02:19.120 --> 02:21.580
and I expect this precinct

02:21.700 --> 02:27.120
to maintain its high record with the
department under your new lieutenant.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.960
Do you wish to make any remarks,
Lieutenant?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.290
I'll talk to the men individually.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.090
Good idea.

02:34.210 --> 02:36.290
Dixon, I want to talk to you.

02:36.420 --> 02:39.000
- I'll use your office, Thomas.
- Yes, sir.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.010
- That's all, boys.
- Congratulations.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.220
Good luck, Lieutenant.

02:46.270 --> 02:48.270
Sit down, Dixon.

02:48.850 --> 02:53.970
We've had 12 more legitimate citizen
complaints against you this month

02:54.110 --> 02:56.240
for assault and battery.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.480
From who? Hoods, dusters, mugs.
Lot of nickel rats.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.950
You're a big disappointment to me,
Dixon.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.500
You've just seen a man who
started out at the same time you did

03:07.620 --> 03:09.960
take a big step up in the department,

03:10.080 --> 03:12.790
which you'll never do
unless you get hold of yourself.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.340
I know what to get hold of, sir:
a little more pull.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.160
Sit still!

03:18.380 --> 03:22.010
You've got to learn what's expected
of a police officer and what isn't.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.220
Yes, sir. I'll try to learn
not to hate hoods so much.

03:25.350 --> 03:29.850
You don't hate hoodlums, you like
to beat them up. You get fun out of it.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.070
You like to read about yourself
in the newspapers

03:33.190 --> 03:36.190
as the tough cop
who isn't afraid to wade in anywhere.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.530
Your job is to detect criminals,
not to punish them.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.490
Is that all, sir?

03:46.450 --> 03:51.000
I'm reducing your rank, Dixon.
You're going back to second grade.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.160
Any more complaints against you
for cruelty or roughhouse

03:55.290 --> 03:57.830
and you'll be back in uniform
pounding a beat.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.670
It's no fun telling you this.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.390
You're a good man with a good brain,

04:03.510 --> 04:07.680
but you're no good to the department
unless you learn to control yourself.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.480
All right, you can go now.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.730
Thank you, sir, for the advice.

04:34.830 --> 04:36.950
Hey, Willie. Willie!

04:39.300 --> 04:41.380
How you feeling, Willie?

04:41.510 --> 04:43.590
Feeling fine, thanks.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.800
Don't you think
you'd better be in bed, Willie?

04:45.930 --> 04:49.560
Parole rules allow me to 12 o'clock.
I got 20 minutes yet.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.890
How's Mr Scalise, Willie?

04:52.020 --> 04:54.150
What you tryin' to do, trap me?

04:54.270 --> 04:58.400
I ain't consortin' with questionable
characters and nobody can prove I am.

04:58.520 --> 05:03.020
That's a nice boy.
You better get to bed, it's good for you.

05:03.150 --> 05:05.150
Sure.

05:39.610 --> 05:42.070
- Who is it?
- Willie.

05:48.490 --> 05:52.290
My point. Come on,
eight the hard way, two fours.

05:52.410 --> 05:55.960
- Seven the loser.
- You're lucky tonight, Mr Morrison.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.420
The little lady brought me luck.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.460
- Your dice, Mr Paine.
- Pass.

06:01.590 --> 06:04.930
- Your dice, Mr Morrison.
- OK, I'll shoot 3,000.

06:05.970 --> 06:08.180
- I'll take one.
- I'll take 500 of it.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.890
I'll take the rest. You're covered.

06:11.010 --> 06:14.260
- Hello.
- Care to join our game, Mr Bender?

06:14.390 --> 06:17.480
- Sure, sure.
- How are things?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.100
Oh, fine.

06:19.230 --> 06:23.610
Bumped into a couple of old friends
of ours, Dixon and Klein.

06:23.730 --> 06:27.480
They asked about you,
but I think they're too busy to drop in.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.650
Too bad.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.830
All right, come on, dice!
Give it to me, a six. Right back.

06:32.950 --> 06:34.870
Here we go, six!

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
- Ten.
- Ten.

06:36.620 --> 06:40.040
Mr Morrison is from Texas,
and very rich.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.550
Here, you breathe on 'em.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.340
Now you got Lady Luck ridin'
with you, dice. This is it, a six!

06:46.470 --> 06:48.090
Give it to me!

06:48.220 --> 06:49.890
There it is, a six!

06:50.010 --> 06:53.680
- And getting richer.
- Six is my lucky number.

06:53.810 --> 06:56.270
I'll shoot the whole 6,000.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.310
- Are you taking any, gentlemen?
- A grand.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.150
Same here.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.860
Four open.

07:04.980 --> 07:07.100
You're covered, Mr Morrison.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.910
I like your friends, Mr Paine.
Can't get better action in Amarillo.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.200
All right, dice,
now we're going for the big money.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.000
Come on!

07:16.120 --> 07:17.910
What do you know? A seven!

07:18.040 --> 07:20.210
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home, Mr Morrison.

07:20.330 --> 07:23.750
- Morgan.
- Ken, I have to be at work at 8.30.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.920
That's right, you can't keep
a working girl up all hours.

07:27.050 --> 07:31.140
- Then I'll take you home, Morgan.
- We'll all go. I'll get your things.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.220
There y'are.

07:33.350 --> 07:35.560
- Mr Morrison.
- Yes, sir?

07:35.680 --> 07:38.140
You're 19 grand into it.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.730
Oh, well, that's all right,
you'll get it back some other night.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.070
I ain't leavin' town for a week.

07:47.190 --> 07:50.350
Tell him you changed your mind,
you wanna stay.

07:50.490 --> 07:53.830
No, Ken, I told you
I could only stay until midnight.

07:53.950 --> 07:57.290
- You can't do this to me!
- I'm not doing anything to you.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.500
I brought him here.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.340
Oh...

08:06.050 --> 08:08.050
- So that's it.
- Yes, that's it!

08:08.170 --> 08:11.430
And you're foulin' me up again.
That's all you ever do!

08:11.550 --> 08:13.430
You're telling him to stay.

08:13.550 --> 08:15.100
- No, I'm not.
- Why, you...

08:19.680 --> 08:21.050
Morgan!

08:21.980 --> 08:23.560
You heel!

- Hiya.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.780
- Foley.
- Hi, Sarge.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.990
- Dice joint, huh?
- Yeah. A floater.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.870
- Get his name?
- Morrison. Big barracuda.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.580
He was DOA.
Knife cut his heart in half.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.670
Nobody did it, nobody saw it.

09:26.790 --> 09:29.170
There's a cut on his hand.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.050
He hit somebody hard.
Who runs this parlour?

09:32.170 --> 09:34.430
Tommy Scalise. He's in there.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.260
So dream boy finally
stepped into something, huh?

09:37.390 --> 09:39.430
I've been waiting quite a while.

09:44.770 --> 09:48.020
You should've gone home to bed,
Willie, like you were told.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.690
You'd be asleep now,
with no parole troubles.

09:50.820 --> 09:54.950
I live in this hotel.
I just dropped in for a cigarette.

09:55.780 --> 09:58.490
How do you do, Mr Scalise?

09:59.580 --> 10:02.080
Where did you hide the knife, dream boy?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.870
Go easy, Dixon.
Keep your hands off me.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.460
- Talk.
- Wise up, Mr Dixon.

10:07.580 --> 10:10.700
You made a monkey of yourself before,
trying to hang something on me.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.300
Who killed him,
you or one of your playmates?

10:13.420 --> 10:15.380
You find a corpse
and right away I'm a killer.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.470
You've been a killer for a long time.

10:17.590 --> 10:21.170
Have I? As I remember it,
the jury found me innocent,

10:21.310 --> 10:23.680
and they weren't out
more than 15 minutes.

10:23.810 --> 10:25.480
You're still a killer.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.060
Why do you always try to push me
in the gutter, Dixon?

10:28.190 --> 10:30.230
I got as much right
on the sidewalk as you.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.940
Don't talk to me about rights.
You're a hood and a murderer.

10:33.070 --> 10:36.320
You're a pretty smart rat, Scalise,
but this is your off night.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.240
Why are you always jumpin' after me?

10:39.370 --> 10:42.910
Four years, jumpin' after me
like I was somebody special. Why?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.710
That's right, getting you
is a special job of mine.

10:45.830 --> 10:48.250
I can't figure you out.
Your father liked me...

10:48.370 --> 10:50.120
Shut up!

10:50.250 --> 10:53.210
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Got anything, Dixon?

10:53.340 --> 10:56.090
I've been waiting to tell you
what happened, Lieutenant.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.930
Take them outside.
We'll question them later.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.260
Congratulations on your promotion,
Lieutenant.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.350
OK, OK. Let's have it.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.360
Mr Morrison was brought here
by a fellow named Ken Paine,

11:10.480 --> 11:13.020
sort of an acquaintance of mine.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.950
There was a girl with him,
I, uh, didn't quite get her name.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.030
A Morgan something.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.770
Mr Morrison wanted
a little friendly play.

11:21.910 --> 11:25.580
- How much did he win?
- He didn't win. He lost.

11:25.700 --> 11:29.490
- You're lying, Scalise.
- Let's hear his story first, Dixon.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.450
He lost a grand or so,
but he didn't care.

11:32.580 --> 11:37.040
He was makin' a play for this girl,
showin' his stuff. Paine was jealous.

11:37.170 --> 11:41.590
He hit the girl first, smacked her
hard on the face, and she ran out.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.010
Then Morrison tackled Paine.

11:44.140 --> 11:47.980
Morrison pulled a gun, but Paine
had him so he couldn't shoot,

11:48.100 --> 11:50.350
and they wrestled into the bedroom.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.190
Before I could call the cops,
Paine came out.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.810
He didn't say anything, just left.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.530
Then Morrison came out
and fell on the floor.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.820
- He was dead when I got to him.
- What did you do with the knife?

12:01.950 --> 12:04.080
There wasn't any weapon.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.000
- Paine must have taken it along.
- You're lying, Scalise.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.170
- Let me handle him, Lieutenant.
- What is Paine's address?

12:10.290 --> 12:12.290
I don't know.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.890
"K Paine, 58 Pike Street,
Chelsea 32099."

12:26.010 --> 12:29.590
Another telephone number:
Murray Hill 59970. What's that?

12:29.730 --> 12:32.270
A pool room on Third Avenue.

12:32.390 --> 12:36.180
You won't have any trouble
picking him up. He was blind.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.650
All neat and ready with the fall guy,
huh? Let me handle him...

12:39.780 --> 12:41.990
Go after Paine, Dixon.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.990
Come on, Paul.

13:02.010 --> 13:04.050
Keep the change.

13:43.010 --> 13:46.050
...I-S-O-N. Yeah, Ted Morrison.

13:46.180 --> 13:48.140
Kenneth Paine calling.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.600
Don't answer? Maybe he's
in the bar. Have him paged.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.130
But I gotta talk to him, it's important.

13:55.270 --> 13:58.190
Trying to get Ted Morrison
on the phone, huh?

13:59.770 --> 14:01.640
Who are you?

14:04.400 --> 14:07.020
Detective Dixon, 16th Squad.

14:08.070 --> 14:09.440
Get out.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.080
Maybe he's trying to win his money back.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.910
Don't give me that.
He was cleanin' up.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.290
How much?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.090
And he's gotta cut me in.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.300
After what you did to him?

14:21.420 --> 14:23.420
He started it!

14:23.550 --> 14:25.590
All among friends.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.430
Hello.

14:29.300 --> 14:36.260
He isn't? Look, Kenneth Paine wants
him to call as soon as he comes in.

14:36.390 --> 14:38.430
That's right.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.980
I said get out. I don't like cops.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.620
Ted Morrison is not gonna
call you back, Paine.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.330
Nobody asked you.

14:53.450 --> 14:57.710
Somebody sunk a knife
into Morrison. He's dead.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.290
Dead?

14:59.420 --> 15:01.380
You're lyin'.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.800
Scalise is trying to frame you,
says you knifed him.

15:06.510 --> 15:08.260
Go home.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.380
I'm trying to help you. Scalise and
his boys are hanging a murder on you.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.890
They knocked him off to get
their dough back after you left.

15:15.020 --> 15:17.940
- Come on.
- No cop's gonna touch me!

15:18.060 --> 15:20.270
Stand up alone, then.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.020
I'll stand up when I wanna.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.690
Get outta here.

15:28.450 --> 15:30.280
Get out!

15:49.420 --> 15:52.290
OK, buddy. Come on, let's go.

16:02.150 --> 16:04.230
Come on.

17:04.170 --> 17:06.210
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Mark?'

17:07.040 --> 17:10.160
- Oh, hello, Paul.
- 'Did you find him?'

17:10.300 --> 17:12.470
'Mark? Mark?'

17:13.050 --> 17:14.510
Hello?

17:15.470 --> 17:19.349
Hello? Operator, there's a bad
connection, get this line clear.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.670
'Mark, can you hear me?'

17:21.810 --> 17:22.940
Yeah.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.520
I picked up some stuff on him
you ought to hear.

17:25.650 --> 17:27.359
Go easy on him, he's a war hero.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.650
'Got a hatful of medals
and a lot of newspaper friends.

17:30.780 --> 17:34.030
'When he got out of the service,
he wrote a syndicated column.

17:34.150 --> 17:37.360
'I thought I'd tell you so you don't
muss him up if you run into him.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.660
'Going to wait there for him?'

17:41.750 --> 17:44.540
Yeah, I'll stick around
in case he shows up.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.070
'So long.'

18:21.910 --> 18:25.250
Will you send a cab
to 58 Pike Street, please?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.950
- You call a cab?
- No, not me.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.970
- Pennsylvania Station, please.
- Yes, sir.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.780
Give me a ticket to Pittsburgh,
the first train out.

20:26.370 --> 20:28.870
17 dollars and 8 cents.

21:32.020 --> 21:35.940
Hello, Paul. I covered a few bars
in the neighbourhood.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.520
I just got here. See this?

21:40.230 --> 21:42.560
Slipped in and out after I was here.

21:42.690 --> 21:45.190
Probably watching you.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.370
Nice piece of luck for me.

21:47.490 --> 21:49.410
You can't be everywhere.

21:49.530 --> 21:52.740
He took all his stuff
out of this closet kinda quick.

21:52.870 --> 21:55.250
Just his uniform and one shoe.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.500
There's another closet.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.220
- Nothing in there. It's empty.
- Maybe somebody saw him get away.

22:07.340 --> 22:10.670
There's an old lady
in the window downstairs.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.750
Police. We'd like to talk to you.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.960
What do you want?

22:41.090 --> 22:43.050
How long have you been sitting here?

22:43.170 --> 22:46.300
Since after dinner.
I always sit here at night.

22:46.420 --> 22:49.540
- You know Kenneth Paine?
- Oh, yes, I know him.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.810
- Have you seen him tonight?
- Yes. He left in a taxi.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.680
- When?
- I don't know.

22:55.810 --> 22:59.230
When you get old like me,
you don't care what time it is.

22:59.350 --> 23:03.180
- Approximately how long ago?
- About 20 minutes, I think.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.690
The taxi man woke me up.

23:05.820 --> 23:10.700
Everybody wakes me up tonight.
Usually I can sleep here.

23:10.820 --> 23:14.650
I always sleep here
since my husband died.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.620
It seems less lonely. Music helps me.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.670
Thank you, madam. Come on, Paul.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.710
That's all, thank you.

23:28.170 --> 23:31.670
- He's running for it, huh?
- We'll get him.

23:36.930 --> 23:40.720
You cover the Yellow Cab stand,
see if you can pick up the driver.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.510
- I'll cover the independent garages.
- OK.

24:57.850 --> 25:00.940
Hey! Open up! I know you're in there!

25:01.810 --> 25:04.440
Open up, you dirty rat! Open...

27:15.900 --> 27:19.410
- Where's the lieutenant?
- Sign this. He's in there.

27:24.620 --> 27:27.460
Lieutenant, we got a break on this.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.460
One of the porters saw Paine
stick it in a locker.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.240
Oh, good.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.580
Here's the cab driver's statement.

27:38.010 --> 27:41.390
"Picked up a fare at 58 Pike Street
at around 1:10." Is that right?

27:41.510 --> 27:43.390
That's right.

27:45.890 --> 27:48.100
You recognise this bag?

27:48.230 --> 27:51.980
Yeah, the guy was carryin' it
when he came out of the house.

27:52.110 --> 27:55.110
I noticed the name:
Kenneth something.

27:56.530 --> 27:58.740
Yeah, Kenneth Paine.

27:58.860 --> 28:00.990
He had a bandage under one eye.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.320
Yeah, piece of tape.

28:03.450 --> 28:05.870
- Which eye?
- Uh, the...

28:07.290 --> 28:09.330
left eye, like this.

28:09.460 --> 28:14.630
Under the left eye. Thanks, you can go.
We know where to get you.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.790
Looks like we have a definite line
on Paine, Lieutenant.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.750
The ticket agent at Penn station
sold him a ticket to Pittsburgh.

28:23.890 --> 28:27.680
Evidently trying to throw us off.
He's probably holed up in town.

28:27.810 --> 28:31.230
- No line on the girl, Lieutenant.
- Keep calling, Benson.

28:31.350 --> 28:34.360
Scalise thinks she was either
an actress or a model.

28:34.480 --> 28:38.150
Call the agencies on both,
as soon as they open in the morning.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.030
Call CB and have them teletype
Paine's description to Pittsburgh.

28:42.160 --> 28:47.240
Dixon, take yourself a rest. You too,
Klein, then get busy on the hotels.

28:47.370 --> 28:51.250
- Communication, please.
- I'm going home for a few hours.

28:51.370 --> 28:54.500
Knock off, Casey,
and then report back at eight.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.210
Good night, boys.

28:57.340 --> 29:01.220
Teletype the following description
to Pittsburgh: age, about 36...

29:01.340 --> 29:03.340
Give me Communications.

29:03.470 --> 29:07.810
Height, six feet one. Weight, 180lbs.
Hair, dark. Build, average...

29:09.270 --> 29:12.810
You look beat, Mark.
Don't you feel good?

30:11.450 --> 30:14.670
- Hey, Mark, you awake?
- Yeah.

30:14.790 --> 30:17.460
We've got a line on the girl.

30:24.010 --> 30:27.760
Her name is Morgan Taylor, from
Washington Heights. I got her number.

30:27.890 --> 30:30.970
- What is it?
- Wentworth 35098.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.350
Wentworth 35098.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.460
All right, all right.

31:01.130 --> 31:02.170
Hello.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.380
Does Morgan Taylor live there?

31:05.670 --> 31:07.960
Yeah, she lives here.

31:08.090 --> 31:12.600
No, she ain't here now.
She's gone to work. Who's callin'?

31:12.720 --> 31:15.060
Never mind, I'll call her later.

31:15.180 --> 31:17.810
She's gone to work.
Have you got her employment address?

31:17.940 --> 31:19.730
Here it is.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.860
Friedman and Lyon, 525 Eighth Avenue.

31:25.940 --> 31:29.860
Very nice. But too high-style
for my customers.

31:29.990 --> 31:34.080
- Maybe we could make a bolero, Oleg.
- I'll sketch it.

31:34.200 --> 31:38.830
Mmm, I'm not sure. I'll let you know
when I send the order in.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.710
Thank you, Morgan.

31:40.830 --> 31:44.040
It's OK with me. We have more orders
than we can fill on this number.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.670
- Did they notice it?
- I don't think so.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.510
Come here, let me see it in the light.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.680
Still shows a little.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.170
I'll put some more pancake on it.

31:56.310 --> 31:59.270
You know, Morgan,
it's your own fault. Hold that.

31:59.390 --> 32:02.220
You keep thinking of him
as a glamour boy.

32:02.360 --> 32:06.530
You won't see him for what he is,
which is definitely a jerk.

32:06.650 --> 32:09.530
So he won the war and freed the slaves!

32:09.650 --> 32:14.150
Does that entitle him to spend
his life drinking barrels of whisky

32:14.280 --> 32:16.860
and punching girls on the nose?

32:16.990 --> 32:20.740
Don't worry.
I'm not going to see him anymore.

32:20.870 --> 32:24.530
You said that before.
He rolls his alcoholic eyes at you

32:24.670 --> 32:27.380
and you set yourself up
for another left hook.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.380
You can't help him, Morgan.

32:29.510 --> 32:32.800
- I guess you're right.
- Someone to see you, Miss Taylor.

32:32.930 --> 32:35.720
- Who?
- Oh, tell him to drop dead.

32:35.850 --> 32:39.730
It's important, Mr Friedman said
to come to the office right away.

32:48.860 --> 32:51.530
Miss Taylor,
this is Mr Dixon and Mr Klein.

32:51.650 --> 32:54.060
They are police detectives.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.240
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

32:56.370 --> 32:58.750
Sit down, please, Miss Taylor.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.500
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

33:02.620 --> 33:04.410
What would you like to know?

33:04.540 --> 33:07.170
You were with Kenneth Paine last night?

33:07.290 --> 33:08.500
Yes.

33:08.630 --> 33:11.220
You were at a s0-called
floating crap game

33:11.340 --> 33:14.180
in the apartment of a man named Scalise

33:14.300 --> 33:16.180
at the 43rd Street Hotel. Correct?

33:16.300 --> 33:17.420
Yes.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.980
Have you been in touch
with Paine this morning?

33:20.100 --> 33:21.440
No.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.560
Have you any idea where he might be?

33:23.690 --> 33:25.230
No, I haven't.

33:25.350 --> 33:28.180
From what we hear, you're pretty
well acquainted with Paine.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.820
- Yes.
- How well? Could you tell us?

33:30.940 --> 33:33.730
- I'm his wife.
- Is that so?

33:33.860 --> 33:36.860
But you're living with your father,
we understand.

33:36.990 --> 33:39.580
Ken and I separated three months ago.

33:39.700 --> 33:43.460
What happened at Scalise's
while you were there?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.870
May I know why you're asking me
all these questions?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.920
We'd rather tell you afterward,
if you don't mind.

33:52.170 --> 33:54.960
Well, Kenneth was drinking and...

33:55.090 --> 33:56.890
we had a quarrel.

33:57.010 --> 33:59.810
I understand he hit you.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.010
Yes.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.650
- Did you see him hit Morrison?
- No, I didn't. I left.

34:06.770 --> 34:09.230
- Where'd you go?
- Home.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.320
Take a taxi?

34:11.440 --> 34:14.989
No, I met my father at his stand
a block from the hotel.

34:15.110 --> 34:17.620
He's a taxi driver.
He drove me to the subway.

34:17.739 --> 34:19.909
Did you hear from Paine
after you got home?

34:20.030 --> 34:21.440
Yes, he telephoned.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.159
- What'd he say?
- I don't know, I hung up.

34:24.290 --> 34:26.370
- What time was that?
- About 12:30.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.840
Did he call from his house?

34:28.960 --> 34:31.840
- No.
- How do you know if you hung up?

34:31.960 --> 34:34.800
Because my father went down
to Ken's place after he dropped me.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.420
- What for?
- Really, is this necessary?

34:38.550 --> 34:40.679
We think so, Miss Taylor.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.810
I didn't want to tell him anything,

34:42.929 --> 34:45.520
but I was crying,
and he noticed the bruise.

34:45.639 --> 34:47.679
- What'd he say?
- He was very angry.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.320
- He told me before that...
- What?

34:51.860 --> 34:55.650
Well, that if Ken ever hit me again,
he'd beat his head off.

34:55.780 --> 34:57.860
Morrison was killed last night.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.410
No!

35:00.530 --> 35:03.530
At Scalise's place,
shortly after you left.

35:05.410 --> 35:07.670
He was killed with a knife.

35:09.830 --> 35:13.040
And you're looking for Ken
because you think he did it?

35:13.170 --> 35:15.550
When did your husband start
getting jealous of Mr Morrison?

35:16.420 --> 35:18.920
Jealous? That's silly.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.100
Mr Morrison was somebody I hardly knew.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.560
- But you went out with him.
- No, Ken asked me out to dinner.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.940
You just said you were separated
from your husband.

35:27.060 --> 35:30.730
Yes, but he kept insisting,
and I felt sorry for him.

35:30.860 --> 35:33.400
When I got to the restaurant,
he had Mr Morrison with him.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.430
Then after dinner,
Ken took us to this gambling place.

35:36.570 --> 35:39.410
Then I realised
all he wanted to see me for

35:39.530 --> 35:44.200
was to use me as a sort of decoy
to help get Mr Morrison to go there.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.660
I was sinking pretty low, I thought.

35:48.910 --> 35:52.160
Poor Ken.
He must be desperate for money.

35:52.290 --> 35:53.910
Why did Paine hit you?

35:54.040 --> 35:57.660
Because I wanted to go home.
He didn't want Mr Morrison to leave.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.930
Because Morrison was winning.

36:00.050 --> 36:02.100
- Yes.
- How much was he ahead?

36:02.220 --> 36:05.390
A great deal.
I think they said about 19,000.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.850
Thank you for the information.
We won't bother you any longer.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.490
- Hi!
- Well, hi!

36:22.620 --> 36:24.370
Hello, Jack.

36:24.490 --> 36:26.790
- Hello, Morgan.
- Night, Mary. See you around.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.290
Night.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.130
Oh, Miss Taylor.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.710
- Hello.
- Good evening.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.630
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Have you found Ken?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.130
No.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.800
You think I know where he's hiding
and won't tell.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.930
Where are you going now?

36:44.050 --> 36:46.630
- Home.
- Would you mind if I came along?

36:46.760 --> 36:49.800
A nice way to put it when you're
out to give me the third degree.

36:49.930 --> 36:52.720
This is no third degree,
this is strictly off the record.

36:52.850 --> 36:55.760
Have you come to nab me
as a gambling-house habituée?

36:55.900 --> 36:59.490
I'm not really. I've never been
in one of those places before.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.860
Are you... are you having dinner
with anyone?

37:02.990 --> 37:05.830
- You inviting me?
- Yes.

37:05.950 --> 37:08.870
I take that subway, there.
It'll take me a few minutes to change.

37:08.990 --> 37:11.070
That's good enough.

37:12.370 --> 37:14.990
- Hey, Dad, you home?
- I'm cookin'.

37:15.130 --> 37:17.670
- There's company.
- Dames?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.210
No.

37:21.550 --> 37:24.220
This is my father. Mr Dixon.

37:25.300 --> 37:28.390
- Mark Dixon!
- Glad to know you.

37:29.310 --> 37:31.480
You don't remember me.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.560
I'm Jiggs Taylor.

37:33.690 --> 37:37.690
- I'm sorry, I don't recall.
- Excuse me, I'll get ready.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.940
Well, sit down, I'll tell you about it.

37:43.240 --> 37:47.580
It's 2:00am.
I'm cruisin' through Central Park.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.830
There's a blizzard goin' on.

37:50.950 --> 37:53.240
A detective jumps in my cab and says,

37:53.370 --> 37:56.710
"Follow that black sedan,
it's full of thieves."

37:56.830 --> 37:58.990
So I give her the gas.

38:00.130 --> 38:04.050
Here, here's the diploma
the mayor gave me.

38:04.930 --> 38:08.810
"For aiding Detective Mark Dixon
in a time of danger."

38:08.930 --> 38:11.470
Oh, yes. Six years ago.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.690
Say, Dad, let's hear about
how they opened fire

38:14.810 --> 38:17.110
and riddled your cab with bullets.

38:17.230 --> 38:19.900
Mark can tell you himself.
Can't you, Mark?

38:20.020 --> 38:22.730
Yes, there were a few shots fired.

38:22.860 --> 38:26.320
A few shots? Dad always said it was
a bigger battle than the Argonne.

38:26.450 --> 38:30.240
That's the trouble with
the new generation: no respect.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.120
How about a drink, Mark?

38:32.240 --> 38:35.070
- No, thanks.
- On duty, huh?

38:35.210 --> 38:37.960
I suppose you're workin'
on that Morrison killing?

38:38.080 --> 38:40.290
- That's right.
- Cigarette?

38:41.630 --> 38:43.300
Thanks.

38:44.210 --> 38:46.620
Any other suspects besides Ken?

38:48.050 --> 38:51.640
That fella Scalise, huh?
I've heard about him.

38:51.760 --> 38:56.260
The department thinks he's clean
on that job. He's been released on bail.

38:56.390 --> 39:00.100
- He's on a gambling charge only.
- But you got your own ideas, huh?

39:00.230 --> 39:04.190
He lied about Morrison being
the loser when the game broke up.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.740
Your daughter says
he was about 19,000 ahead.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.270
It looks like a cinch he's the guy.

39:10.410 --> 39:12.370
I wouldn't tell a lot of people

39:12.490 --> 39:15.530
about going up to Paine's place
last night to beat him up.

39:15.660 --> 39:18.380
I don't care how many people hear it.
He's had it coming for some time.

39:18.500 --> 39:22.340
Oh, Dad, please! Mr Dixon isn't
interested in my life story.

39:22.460 --> 39:26.340
I ask you, what would you do
if you had a son-in-law like that?

39:26.470 --> 39:30.300
You know, it is a lucky thing
I didn't find him in last night.

39:30.430 --> 39:31.970
I'd have...

39:32.100 --> 39:35.890
I forgot to ask you, I've been
so excited over meetin' you again:

39:36.020 --> 39:38.900
how about some chow?
I got enough for three.

39:39.020 --> 39:43.400
- No, Dad, we're going out.
- Well, we could talk over old times.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.140
I'll be seeing you, Mr Taylor.
Nice meeting you again.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.200
Well, least I'm glad
she's goin' out with somebody

39:49.320 --> 39:52.160
who ain't gonna land her
up to her neck in crooks.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.330
You're horrible, Dad!

39:55.700 --> 39:59.120
- Good night.
- Good night, honey. Have fun, kids.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.840
Good evening, Mr Detective.
Where've you been hangin' out?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.970
- Hello, Martha.
- Good evening.

40:10.090 --> 40:12.140
How do you do?

40:13.390 --> 40:15.470
You know, I like places like this

40:15.600 --> 40:19.350
that specialise in good food
instead of head waiters.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.350
It's the worst food in town.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.730
But don't worry, they usually serve
a stomach pump with the dessert.

40:24.860 --> 40:28.240
Who invited you to come to
my restaurant, Mr Detective? Not me.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.740
Martha's the head of a ring of burglars.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.690
My presence makes her nervous.

40:32.820 --> 40:36.190
Last night we got a whole basketful
of diamonds. You wanna see?

40:36.330 --> 40:38.870
Bring us two of your
dangerous dinners, Martha.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.420
D'you know how much I've been
offered to poison this man?

40:41.540 --> 40:44.380
- 10 dollars.
- I'm holding out for 15.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.510
- Two dinners. You want wine?
- Bring a small bottle.

40:47.630 --> 40:50.050
Huh! Same old cheapskate!

40:50.170 --> 40:51.790
She adores you, doesn't she?

40:51.930 --> 40:54.890
- Ought to, I sent her husband up.
- Was he really a burglar?

40:55.010 --> 40:58.310
- Wifebeater.
- Oh, she's wonderful.

40:58.430 --> 41:02.230
She's under wraps on account of you.
I don't usually eat here with a dame.

41:02.350 --> 41:03.690
Oh, I mean...

41:03.810 --> 41:06.480
Dame's all right.
I imagine you bring your wife here.

41:06.610 --> 41:09.320
- There's no such animal.
- Oh? My dad said you were married.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.400
Your dad is not a reliable source
of information.

41:12.530 --> 41:16.080
You're quite right. I never knew
anybody who tells so many lies.

41:16.200 --> 41:20.000
He does it for fun, though.
He's always driving kings and queens,

41:20.120 --> 41:24.000
or movie stars, and overhearing
the most amazing conversations.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.740
- Like your dad, huh?
- Crazy about him.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.090
I hope you come here often, young lady.

41:29.210 --> 41:31.920
Five years he sits in my restaurant
frightening everybody away.

41:32.050 --> 41:35.220
A detective in the window: you can
imagine how people want to come in.

41:35.340 --> 41:38.920
But now with a beautiful lady he looks
almost human. How's the soup?

41:39.060 --> 41:41.270
- Horrible.
- It's very good.

41:41.390 --> 41:43.690
Thanks. Eat all you want.

41:44.730 --> 41:47.690
Have you been trying
to get in touch with Paine?

41:48.900 --> 41:51.610
No. I don't quite know what to do.

41:52.570 --> 41:55.780
- When were you married?
- After he came back from the war.

41:55.910 --> 41:58.370
But we knew each other before that.

41:58.490 --> 42:01.040
You said this morning
you were separated.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.500
- Three months ago.
- Why?

42:04.080 --> 42:08.130
It's hard to say why you leave
a man, or why you stop loving him.

42:08.250 --> 42:11.380
I always blamed Ken,
but I guess it was my fault too,

42:11.510 --> 42:15.470
not understanding what made him seem
so mean and impossible.

42:15.590 --> 42:18.890
I guess the chiefthing
wrong with Ken was no job,

42:19.010 --> 42:20.970
and lots of pride.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.850
Too much pride.

42:22.980 --> 42:26.850
A man can usually find work
if he wants to.

42:26.980 --> 42:28.940
You're worried about me feeling badly

42:29.060 --> 42:31.470
because he's going to be arrested,
aren't you?

42:32.280 --> 42:37.410
- Something like that.
- I think I'll stick by him if he is.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.540
He'll need me. I owe it to him.

42:42.490 --> 42:45.950
You still love him, huh?
In spite of everything.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.130
No. It isn't love any more.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.880
Mr Detective! Telephone!

42:52.000 --> 42:54.870
Excuse me. That must be my partner.

42:55.010 --> 42:58.050
Probably wants to know what I'm eating.

43:01.930 --> 43:03.310
Dixon speaking.

43:03.430 --> 43:07.150
Been trying to get you for an hour,
Mark. Big doin's. We found Paine.

43:08.230 --> 43:09.940
Where did you find him?

43:10.060 --> 43:12.810
River watchman reported
to the 6th Precinct down here

43:12.940 --> 43:16.450
that somebody slugged him last night.
He just punched his clock at 3am.

43:16.570 --> 43:19.820
'Sent two men over, but they couldn't
make head or tail of the slugging.

43:19.950 --> 43:21.370
'Nothing stolen, nothing missing.

43:21.490 --> 43:24.540
'Until the watchman remembered
the man held something like a body.'

43:24.660 --> 43:27.250
They started draggin' the river
and brought up Paine a half-hour ago.

43:27.370 --> 43:29.460
- Who's that?
- Mark.

43:30.330 --> 43:33.450
Mark? Thomas. We found Paine
in the river with his skull cracked.

43:33.590 --> 43:36.050
We'll meet you at his apartment
in 15 minutes.

43:36.170 --> 43:38.170
OK, Lieutenant.

43:41.970 --> 43:45.220
- What's the matter? You look sick.
- Give me the cheque.

43:45.350 --> 43:48.390
You got to leave the beautiful girl
just as she's beginning to like you.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.020
That's what you get
for being a detective.

43:51.150 --> 43:54.030
No fun, always chasin' the wrong people.

43:59.780 --> 44:03.580
- Has something happened?
- I've gotta go out on a job.

44:03.700 --> 44:05.160
Please, finish your dinner.

44:05.290 --> 44:07.710
It's really the best
chicken and rice in town.

44:07.830 --> 44:10.380
- I'm sorry you have to leave.
- Thanks.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.090
- So long.
- Bye.

44:12.210 --> 44:14.090
Good night.

44:17.840 --> 44:21.840
- You like him, huh?
- I think he's very nice.

44:21.970 --> 44:26.640
I'm glad. You know what
that fella needs? A family.

44:26.770 --> 44:30.850
He's got nobody. All he thinks
of day and night is his job.

44:30.980 --> 44:35.940
He grabs himself a dizzy blonde
once in a while, but that's no life.

44:36.070 --> 44:38.740
Fella like him oughta be married
to a beautiful girl.

44:38.860 --> 44:42.950
- Have a home, kids, and...
- You're wasting your propaganda.

44:43.070 --> 44:47.190
- I'm married.
- Buzzin' a married woman!

44:47.330 --> 44:50.080
Wait till I see that dope again.

44:55.340 --> 44:58.300
- You got it?
- It's blood, all right, quite fresh.

44:58.420 --> 45:00.470
I'd say not more than 24 hours.

45:00.590 --> 45:02.470
Get it to the lab right away.

45:02.590 --> 45:05.430
That clinches it.
Paine was killed in his room.

45:05.550 --> 45:09.510
Somebody came in and slugged him.
He bumped his head when he fell.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.480
He had a silver plate in his head

45:11.600 --> 45:14.980
as a result of a shrapnel wound in
the war. The fall must've killed him.

45:15.110 --> 45:17.230
I buy that, Lieutenant.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.900
The killer tried to get the body out,
but he was surprised by someone,

45:21.030 --> 45:23.610
probably Dixon when he came
through the front door.

45:24.780 --> 45:27.740
He ducked behind
the staircase here, and hid the body.

45:27.870 --> 45:30.910
That's the reason
for the bloodstain on the wall.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.790
- If it is Paine's blood.
- We'll get the lab report shortly.

45:34.920 --> 45:37.920
Now, we can establish
the time of the killing

45:38.040 --> 45:41.330
as between 12:30,
when Paine must've got here

45:41.470 --> 45:46.350
and, uh, 3:00am, when the killer
knocked out the watchman on the pier.

45:48.510 --> 45:52.090
Hello, Dixon. You know Mr Gilroy
from the DA's office.

45:52.230 --> 45:53.980
- Sure. How are you?
- Hello.

45:54.100 --> 45:57.940
A lot of fancy footwork you did
last night, Dixon. You and Mr Paine.

45:58.060 --> 46:00.270
It couldn't be helped, Lieutenant.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.280
I can't understand
how you didn't see him.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.520
You came in here at 12:50,
Klein talked to you on the phone.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.030
That's right.

46:08.160 --> 46:12.000
Paine came, packed and left at 1:10.
That's when the taxi picked him up.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.710
You must've practically
passed each other.

46:14.830 --> 46:17.710
Well, he wasn't here,
so I thought he might be drinking.

46:17.830 --> 46:19.830
I had a look in a couple of bars.

46:19.960 --> 46:23.300
It's queer to figure a guy on the lam
is going to be sitting around bars.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.080
- What time did Dixon come back?
- About 1:50.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.560
- And you left right after that?
- Right. We started chasing Paine.

46:29.680 --> 46:34.350
It's obvious. He lays a fake trail.
He goes to the Pennsylvania Station,

46:34.480 --> 46:37.400
and then he decides to come back
and hide out in his own apartment.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.860
He figures the police have been there
and they won't come looking again.

46:40.980 --> 46:43.740
What time did Jiggs Taylor
say he was here?

46:43.860 --> 46:47.200
- About 2:15.
- That pretty well fingers him.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.830
Yeah, and he came down crazy angry,
according to his daughter,

46:49.950 --> 46:53.330
- ready to knock Paine's block off.
- You're wasting your time on Taylor.

46:53.450 --> 46:57.160
How's that? It looks completely
definite: motive, opportunity.

46:57.290 --> 47:00.380
- Scalise did it.
- I don't see that at all, Dixon.

47:00.500 --> 47:03.210
I'm telling you,
Scalise knifed Morrison.

47:03.340 --> 47:05.930
He was afraid Paine
would go to the police,

47:06.050 --> 47:08.090
so he sent someone to finish him off.

47:08.220 --> 47:09.640
That doesn't stand up.

47:09.760 --> 47:14.140
Whoever killed Paine killed him by
accident: he only meant to slug him.

47:14.270 --> 47:17.060
A Scalise hood would've taken
no chances on a rumpus,

47:17.190 --> 47:19.610
he'd have knifed or shot him.
Yes, Benson?

47:19.730 --> 47:22.110
We've got Jiggs Taylor
and his daughter outside.

47:22.230 --> 47:24.940
Bring them in, Harrington.
Has he been talking?

47:25.070 --> 47:27.950
A mile a minute.
You'd think he was going to a picnic.

47:28.070 --> 47:30.660
I think we can wrap the case up tonight.

47:30.780 --> 47:32.790
Get statements from both of them.

47:36.250 --> 47:38.420
- I'm Lieutenant Thomas.
- How do you do?

47:38.540 --> 47:40.790
How d'ya do, Lieutenant?

47:45.010 --> 47:48.260
I was expectin' this.
As I told the boys on the way down,

47:48.380 --> 47:50.500
the minute I heard Ken was murdered,

47:50.640 --> 47:52.970
I knew I was in for a going-over,

47:53.100 --> 47:55.890
having been at the scene of the crime.

47:56.020 --> 47:58.190
You were all ready for us
with your story, huh?

47:58.310 --> 48:01.310
Won't take long.
Save you a lot of time,

48:01.440 --> 48:04.230
give it to you
without you havin' to pump me,

48:04.360 --> 48:06.320
everything that happened.

48:06.440 --> 48:12.400
Came down here last night around 2:15
lookin' for my son-in-law.

48:12.530 --> 48:14.950
You were pretty worked up, huh?

48:15.080 --> 48:19.120
I'll say. I told him last month
if he laid a hand on Morgan again

48:19.250 --> 48:21.080
I'd slap him silly.

48:21.210 --> 48:24.460
Go on.
Go on, let's have it all, Jiggs.

48:26.550 --> 48:28.930
Well, that's all there was.

48:29.050 --> 48:32.850
The door was unlocked,
I walk in, look around,

48:32.970 --> 48:36.270
nobody home, so I walk out.

48:36.390 --> 48:38.350
With his body.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.810
- Whose body?
- Paine's.

48:41.650 --> 48:44.360
That's sure smart figurin', Lieutenant.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.690
- I tell you...
- Never mind the lies, Jiggs!

48:47.820 --> 48:49.900
We've got every one of your moves.

48:50.030 --> 48:51.910
You took the body to the river,

48:52.030 --> 48:55.370
knocked out the watchman on the pier
and dropped Paine in the water.

48:55.490 --> 48:58.700
Oh, so I knocked out
a watchman too, huh? That's fine!

48:58.830 --> 49:01.670
OK, now let me tell you something.

49:01.790 --> 49:05.500
I didn't see Paine. If I had seen him
I'd have taken a poke at him,

49:05.630 --> 49:07.880
I ain't denyin' that. He deserved it.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.790
But I left this place
two minutes after I got here.

49:10.920 --> 49:14.000
Then I picked up a fare
three minutes later on the corner:

49:14.140 --> 49:15.930
Congressman Reynolds.

49:16.050 --> 49:18.590
Took him up to the Astor Hotel.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.970
- Told me...
- Check on that, Klein.

49:21.100 --> 49:23.560
- Yes, sir.
- Sure, check!

49:23.690 --> 49:25.560
Check all you want.

49:25.690 --> 49:28.690
And what time do you claim
you got to the Astor Hotel, Jiggs?

49:28.820 --> 49:30.900
About 2:40.

49:31.030 --> 49:33.360
Anybody see you around there?

49:33.490 --> 49:39.040
Yeah. Uh,... Pat Rafferty
and Hymie Berg. They're taxi drivers.

49:39.540 --> 49:43.170
The congressman doesn't answer
in his room. Want me to run him down?

49:43.290 --> 49:45.080
No. No, we'll check later.

49:45.210 --> 49:49.550
The pier watchman was slugged at 3am
according to reports. Is that right?

49:49.670 --> 49:51.420
Mm-hm. Yes.

49:51.550 --> 49:54.930
That gives Jiggs Taylor 20 minutes
between 2:40 and 3 o'clock

49:55.050 --> 49:58.060
to come back here from
the Astor Hotel and do his stuff.

49:58.180 --> 50:01.230
He couldn't have come back here
from the Astor, killed Paine,

50:01.350 --> 50:04.100
lugged the body out to the car,
driven down to the pier

50:04.230 --> 50:07.980
and slugged the night watchman
by three o'clock, not in 20 minutes.

50:08.110 --> 50:10.110
Seems we're on the wrong man,
Lieutenant,

50:10.230 --> 50:12.440
especially if the congressman
backs him up.

50:12.570 --> 50:15.780
It's not the wrong man.
If Paine was already dead at 2:15

50:15.910 --> 50:20.240
and Taylor got the body at that time,
stuck it in the back of his car...

50:20.370 --> 50:21.830
Well, that's screwy!

50:21.950 --> 50:24.450
I told you I picked up
Congressman Reynolds.

50:24.580 --> 50:27.840
Sure you did. But you were
on the way to dump Paine's body

50:27.960 --> 50:29.800
when Reynolds hailed you.

50:29.920 --> 50:34.550
He took him to the hotel. 20 minutes
was enough to scoot back to the pier,

50:34.670 --> 50:37.460
slug the watchman at 3:00am
and drop Paine's body.

50:37.590 --> 50:40.420
Paine was out of here at 1:10
according to the old lady downstairs.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.140
We're wasting time, Lieutenant.

50:42.270 --> 50:44.390
I don't think so, Dixon.

50:50.730 --> 50:52.780
Bring them along.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.620
Did you see anybody
coming out of that building

51:04.750 --> 51:07.500
carrying something over
his shoulder, like a large bundle?

51:07.620 --> 51:10.410
- I didn't see anything like that.
- I'll take over, Casey.

51:10.540 --> 51:14.000
- Says she didn't notice anyone...
- Never mind.

51:14.130 --> 51:18.890
I'm going to ask you a very important
question, Mrs Tribaum.

51:19.010 --> 51:22.680
Are you sure it was Kenneth Paine
you saw leaving this house at 1 .10?

51:22.810 --> 51:26.690
Of course I'm sure. I never heard
so many foolish questions.

51:26.810 --> 51:29.860
I'm going to try a little experiment,
Mrs Tribaum.

51:29.980 --> 51:34.440
Taylor! I want you to put on
this raincoat and hat.

51:34.570 --> 51:35.950
What for?

51:36.070 --> 51:39.490
Put tape under his eye, somebody,
to match Paine's description.

51:39.610 --> 51:42.650
Oh, no, wait a second.
What's all this for?

51:42.780 --> 51:45.490
Now, don't act dumb, Taylor,
it won't get you anywhere.

51:45.620 --> 51:48.540
Last night, you put on
Paine's coat and hat

51:48.670 --> 51:51.290
and carried his bag
out of here at 1:10,

51:51.420 --> 51:54.460
after you'd killed him
and stuck his body away somewhere.

51:54.590 --> 51:56.550
You wanna come clean now, Jiggs?

51:56.670 --> 51:59.880
- Oh, I told you the truth.
- Then put the coat on.

52:00.010 --> 52:04.060
Don't do it, Dad. They have no right
to ask you to do that.

52:04.180 --> 52:08.060
No, I won't. I ain't goin' in
for any of these monkey shines.

52:08.180 --> 52:13.060
All right. Dixon, you're about
his build: put the hat and coat on.

52:13.190 --> 52:15.230
That's comic-strip stuff, Lieutenant.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.320
The lady said she saw Paine
leave here last night.

52:18.440 --> 52:22.480
Sure I did.
I saw Mr Paine out of the window.

52:22.620 --> 52:27.580
No, you saw a raincoat,
a hat and a bag. Go ahead, Dixon.

52:28.580 --> 52:31.380
- Anybody got some adhesive tape?
- Here.

52:34.590 --> 52:36.920
Under the left eye.

52:37.050 --> 52:41.590
Mrs Tribaum, did he walk straight to
the car or did he look down at you?

52:41.720 --> 52:44.510
- He looked down.
- Dixon, take the bag.

52:44.640 --> 52:47.100
Just walk to the car and look down once.

52:47.220 --> 52:49.220
Is this where you were sitting?

52:49.350 --> 52:52.520
No. I was standing here
closing the window.

52:52.650 --> 52:55.820
A taxi driver had asked me
if I'd called a cab.

52:55.940 --> 52:59.240
Are you sure you could recognise
a face at that distance, Mrs Tribaum?

53:02.910 --> 53:06.290
I can tell that fellow isn't Mr Paine.

53:06.410 --> 53:09.210
Can you distinguish his face
in this light?

53:09.330 --> 53:13.460
No, but I can tell by something else,
it isn't Mr Paine.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.370
By what?

53:15.500 --> 53:17.250
He didn't wave at me.

53:17.380 --> 53:20.550
- Did Mr Paine always wave at you?
- Always.

53:20.670 --> 53:22.750
He went like this.

53:22.880 --> 53:25.670
What about last night.
Did he wave at you last night?

53:27.760 --> 53:29.840
Do you remember?

53:30.770 --> 53:32.440
Yes, I remember.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.650
He didn't wave last night.

53:34.770 --> 53:37.610
You're right, it wasn't Mr Paine.

53:37.730 --> 53:39.490
No, never.

53:39.610 --> 53:41.570
He would have waved.

53:41.690 --> 53:44.520
Thank you, Mrs Tribaum.

53:44.660 --> 53:47.660
That's it, boys, take him
to the station and book him.

53:47.780 --> 53:51.240
- Well, you're kidding.
- Nobody's kidding, Taylor.

53:51.370 --> 53:55.170
You thought you were pretty fancy
walking off as Paine at 1:10.

53:55.290 --> 53:57.170
You got the body at 2:15,

53:57.290 --> 53:59.830
dropped Congressman Reynolds
at the Astor at 2:40,

53:59.960 --> 54:01.790
and hurried it back to the pier.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.460
- Well, that's screwy! I...
- Take him along, boys.

54:04.590 --> 54:07.180
- I'd like to talk to my father.
- Go ahead.

54:07.300 --> 54:11.800
- May I talk to him alone?
- Can't be done. He's under arrest.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.050
Dad,

54:17.190 --> 54:19.020
please,

54:19.150 --> 54:21.440
did you see Ken last night?

54:22.320 --> 54:24.240
So help me,

54:24.360 --> 54:26.240
I swear by your ma,

54:26.360 --> 54:29.230
I never saw him or laid a hand on him.

54:30.580 --> 54:32.910
I believe you.

54:35.670 --> 54:38.880
You take Miss Taylor home, Casey.
We're knockin' off for tonight.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.710
I'd rather go alone, if I may.

55:01.070 --> 55:04.820
I've been lookin' for you for an hour,
Mark. Scotch and water, Bill.

55:05.950 --> 55:08.740
You got to hand it to Thomas,
he wrapped this one up quick.

55:08.870 --> 55:11.330
His first job, too.
I didn't think he had it in him.

55:11.450 --> 55:14.540
Stop talking like an idiot.
He bungled it.

55:14.660 --> 55:17.080
Wait a minute, Mark, that ain't fair.

55:17.210 --> 55:20.840
Don't tell me what's fair, I know.
Scalise did it.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.170
Scalise did both jobs:
Morrison and Paine.

55:24.300 --> 55:26.340
You can't go against the facts.

55:26.470 --> 55:29.930
I bet Jiggs Taylor will confess
the whole job in a day or two.

55:30.050 --> 55:32.420
- See you later.
- Where you goin'?

55:32.560 --> 55:34.640
I'm going to get it out of Scalise.

55:34.770 --> 55:37.270
Wait a minute, Mark.
You're not on that end of it.

55:37.390 --> 55:40.300
You know the boss's orders,
he's got a plan on Scalise.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.070
Let me go.

55:42.190 --> 55:45.110
Look, Mark, I'm gonna give it
to you straight, like a friend.

55:45.230 --> 55:49.230
I don't like to see you made a monkey
of by a girl with a pretty face.

55:51.120 --> 55:53.660
You're as dumb as Thomas.

55:55.580 --> 55:59.630
- Come on, I'll drive you home.
- You're driving me nowhere.

55:59.750 --> 56:03.250
You stick with your boss and his orders.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.550
You let me go or I'll paste you.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.370
We're closed for the night.

56:31.490 --> 56:33.910
- Scalise in here?
- I'll go and see.

56:34.030 --> 56:36.070
Don't bother.

56:47.710 --> 56:50.250
Get your clothes on, Scalise.

56:50.380 --> 56:52.630
When I'm ready, Mr Dixon.

56:52.760 --> 56:55.850
- Hey, cut that out!
- OK, Steve.

56:57.350 --> 56:59.440
I warn you not to touch me.

56:59.560 --> 57:03.400
Why? You don't seem to be
carrying a knife at the moment.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.150
We found the one you used on Morrison.

57:06.270 --> 57:09.020
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

57:09.150 --> 57:11.530
It's always a pleasure

57:11.650 --> 57:14.520
to watch a cop four-flush.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.360
I don't like rats to grin at me.

57:17.490 --> 57:19.610
That's too bad.

57:19.750 --> 57:22.830
Maybe I'd better show you my hand,
dream boy.

57:27.210 --> 57:31.220
Tonight I'm not kidding, Scalise.
You're gonna talk.

57:31.340 --> 57:36.050
We found out Morrison had you
for about 20 grand and wanted to leave.

57:36.180 --> 57:39.060
So you knifed him.
Then you got worried

57:39.180 --> 57:43.190
about Kenneth Paine sobering up
and telling about what happened,

57:43.310 --> 57:46.650
so you sent one of your mugs
down to his place to knock him off.

57:46.770 --> 57:49.230
You tryin' to frame me for Paine?

57:49.360 --> 57:52.110
You killed Morrison
and you killed Paine,

57:52.240 --> 57:55.070
and I'm going to get a statement
out of you.

57:55.200 --> 57:59.830
Outside, you lugs. He's gonna talk,
and talk to me alone.

57:59.950 --> 58:01.910
Come on, I said outside!

58:03.330 --> 58:05.540
OK, Steve.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.930
Joe, Ernie!

58:56.430 --> 58:59.260
- Have a look out front, Kramer.
- Yeah.

59:13.650 --> 59:15.490
Get your coats.

59:15.610 --> 59:18.740
I oughta finish the job.
This guy's gonna keep after me.

59:18.860 --> 59:22.320
Wouldn't be smart: they'd put on
too much heat for a dead cop.

59:22.450 --> 59:24.500
- They still out there?
- They're still there.

59:24.620 --> 59:26.580
- Both of them?
- Both of them.

59:26.710 --> 59:29.920
- Oh, I can't make up my mind.
- Don't.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.960
All right, have it your way.
Let's go.

59:34.760 --> 59:36.800
Get the key, Steve.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.380
- Yes?
- Mark Dixon.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.880
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk
to you a little, Miss Taylor.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:21.220
What's the matter?

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.170
You're hurt.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.760
I could use a drink.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.980
Where the devil am I?

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.740
I keep coming and going.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:54.540
I don't know why I came here.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.970
I'll go now.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.090
You can't leave like this.

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:10.470
Why did I come here? I must have
had something on my mind.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.850
What happened to you?

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.610
A run-in with Scalise and his pals.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.900
Shouldn't I call the police?

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.780
Let's leave the police out of this.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.330
I made a big idiot
out of myself tonight.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:31.120
Bigger than usual.
Did I bungle this one!

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.290
I'll fix your head. Come with me.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.130
I suggest you use an axe.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.640
Here, come and sit down.

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:57.940
What did they hit you with?

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.110
Various objects.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.230
Why did you fight with Scalise?

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.650
Did it have anything to do with my dad?

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.780
In a way, yes.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:15.790
You don't think Dad did it.
You don't think he's guilty, do you?

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.380
What I think doesn't matter
a roll of nickels.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.910
Most important thing
is that you need a lawyer.

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:26.890
That's what I came here for.
You need a big-time lawyer.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.850
Here, hold this.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:31.220
One that can't lose.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.690
- But if Dad's innocent, I don't...
- That doesn't always help.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:38.480
Innocent people can get
into terrible jams too.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.820
One false move
and you're in over your head.

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:48.530
How much money have you got,
you and your father, for a lawyer?

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.870
None.

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:51.540
No savings?

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.410
No.

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.540
Paine got 'em, huh?

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.040
Yes.

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:05.260
Thanks for the facial.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.680
I feel a lot better now.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:17.770
You go on back to bed. I'll be back
in the morning about 8:30.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.110
You wait here for me.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.110
You're not fooling me.

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.100
You do believe Dad didn't kill him.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.620
Your dad never touched him.
Good night.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.080
Good night.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.110
I'm sorry to wake you up, Paul.
I won't stay but a minute.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.700
I need some dough.

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.990
Who stuck his finger in your eye?

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.580
I've got 700 in the bank.
That leaves me 300 shy.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.790
It's for a lawyer.
Thought you wouldn't mind kicking in.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.890
I want to get Norman Ackerman
to handle the Taylor case.

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:32.300
He never lost a murder verdict
in his life,

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:36.220
but you gotta slap down
one grand, minimum.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.900
Be right with you.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.190
Who is it, Paul?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.110
Mark. He wants 300 bucks.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.950
- For what?
- For a lawyer, for his girl.

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.110
Since when
has that gorilla-head got...

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.900
Shh!

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.250
Please, Shirley, don't argue.

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.410
After the way he treated you,
to have the nerve to ask for money!

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.200
I told you: no arguments, please.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:11.180
You told me you were never
gonna talk to him again!

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.970
I don't know, Shirley.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.520
Sometimes you really get me sore
with this kind of nagging.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.930
$300 for a man you were gonna punch
in the jaw the next time you saw him!

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:27.530
I...

01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:02.100
Take them to the Acme Loan
this time. You'll get more.

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:07.770
Who knows? I might even get
to wear them someday.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.490
Yes?

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:15.570
'Detective Dixon is here
with a young lady.'

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.410
Have him come in.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.240
Send off that cable, Mary,
I'll call you later.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.040
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello, Gerry.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:29.210
Well, what happened to you?

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:33.550
I'm just fine.
Oh, Mr Marsh, this is Miss Taylor.

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:35.250
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss Taylor?

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.790
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.390
I understand Ackerman's out of town.
When do you expect him back?

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.720
He's in Washington, he's due back
around five this afternoon.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.230
I'd like to make an appointment
with him for Miss Taylor.

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.440
Her father's involved
in the Paine-Morrison case.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.520
I read about it.
Thought you were on it, Mark.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:54.530
I am. That's why I'm here.
I like stiff competition.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.770
Here's your retainer
for Miss Taylor's father. It's $1,000.

01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:01.040
I'll hold it. Come in around 5:30.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.790
Mr Ackerman will see you, Miss Taylor.

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:07.960
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:15.130
I never heard of anything
so generous. What you just did.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.840
Oh, my partner kicked in too.

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:22.890
You're an amazing man.
You know something?

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.480
I could kiss you, right here.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.980
I'll take a rain check on that.
I'll give you an alibi for your boss.

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:33.190
Tell him you're late
because of police questioning.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.910
Mr Friedman has dispensed
with my services.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.580
I'm the notorious
Miss Morgan Taylor: bad for buyers.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.080
Might take their minds
off Mr Friedman's creations.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.580
That mug! I'll run him in.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.740
I bet you would.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.040
All right. Goodbye.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.420
Phone call for you, Mr Detective.
Do you want to answer it?

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:56.300
- No, I'm busy.
- That's what I thought.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.630
I told him you weren't here.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.890
It's wonderful how he looks at you.
He didn't even eat his ravioli.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.930
He just eats you up with his eyes,
because you're so beautiful.

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.230
- Cut it out.
- What's the matter?

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:10.980
You don't know how to make love,
so I'm makin' love for you.

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.150
- Bye-bye, Martha.
- Bye.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:21.120
It's a wonderful day.

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:27.330
No job, everybody against me,
my poor dad sitting in a cell,

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:31.290
and it's a wonderful day.
Isn't that amazing?

01:08:31.393 --> 01:08:34.830
- Hey, Mark!
- Excuse me a minute.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.470
- Hello, Mike.
- Where you been hidin', a manhole?

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:40.720
- What's up?
- Skipper's chewin' on the telephone.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.250
Come on!

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:47.020
Do you mind going up to see Ackerman
alone? It might be better at that.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.270
And wait for me at my hotel,
230a East 54th.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.390
I'll be there, Mark.
And thanks for everything.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.479
Let's go.

01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:13.420
- You wanted to see me, Inspector?
- Come here, you.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.880
Is this one of the men
who beat you up last night?

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.890
That was just a personal affair, sir.

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:26.350
Your personal affairs seem to be getting
in the way of the department, Dixon.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:30.229
Take this man out and hold him
as a material witness.

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.229
You had no business going after Scalise.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:40.649
You were asked not to. You were
told to lay off by your superior.

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:44.240
I thought I could get a statement
out of him.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.069
Well, you didn't, and now
you've driven Scalise to cover

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.710
with your bull-headed tactics.
It'll take us days to find him now.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:53.040
- I'll find him.
- You'll find nobody!

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:58.450
I'm not throwing you
out of the department, like I should,

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:02.300
but I'm inviting you to take
one week of your annual vacation,

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.420
beginning as of now.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.430
I don't want to see or hear of you
for a week.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.550
I want you go someplace
and get hold of yourself.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.350
- Yes, sir.
- Look at you!

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.610
All bunged up like a barrelhouse vag.

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:21.490
First thing you'd better do is get
your head fixed up, inside and out.

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:23.360
That's all.

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:25.200
Yes, sir.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.370
He's got a point.
You shouldn't have let Scalise go

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.960
until the Morrison job was cleaned up.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.420
It looked certain
that Paine had done it, sir.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.380
Get on this fella Steve. I got a hunch
he'll sing if you keep on him.

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.130
And try talking to him like Dixon would.

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.680
Yes, sir.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.400
Sit down!

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.910
You are going to talk.

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.620
You were in that crap game
with Morrison.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.790
- Yeah, but I didn't see nothin'.
- Listen!

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.870
I want straight answers,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.080
and I want them now.

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:21.920
Hello. Did you see Ackerman?

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.130
Yes.

01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:34.100
You've been crying. What happened?

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:39.220
Mr Ackerman doesn't want
to take the case. He's too busy.

01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:42.140
There are other lawyers.

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:47.530
I'll get in touch with Bill Cantwell.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.330
He's as good as Ackerman.

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.660
It won't help.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.870
It's no different than it was.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.130
You felt all right this afternoon.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:03.050
I didn't realise how serious it was,

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.260
but now I know.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.220
I thought because Dad was innocent
nothing could happen to him.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.710
- But it will.
- It won't.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.720
It's already happened. He's in jail.

01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:18.480
They'll try him,
and he didn't do anything.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:23.190
Somebody else did it,
and he's got to pay for it.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.070
- He won't be tried.
- Don't try and fool me.

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.980
Ackerman didn't take the case
because he was afraid of losing it.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.230
That means they might find him guilty.

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:37.500
I'm not fooling you. Nothing
is going to happen to your father.

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:40.530
Why?

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.380
You didn't sound so certain before.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.950
Now you're certain.

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.430
Because he didn't kill Paine.

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:51.430
But can you prove it?

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.350
- Yes.
- How?

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.640
Mark, you know something
you haven't told me.

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.440
That's right.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.440
What?

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.390
What is it?

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.820
I'll tell you.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.040
Please.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.450
Oh, that's not fair,
to stand there without telling me,

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.750
even if you have to break
some police rule.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.420
If you know something, Mark...

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:32.840
I can't stand thinking how he feels.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.640
He's never done anything wrong.
You don't know him. He's sweet.

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.560
He's always felt
that everybody was his friend.

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:45.270
Now he's in jail, like a criminal.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:52.740
You don't know what it is
to have your father in trouble.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.480
My father was a thief.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.030
Wh...

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:04.080
He's dead now. He died when I was 17
trying to shoot his way out of jail.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:08.800
I worked all my life
to try to be different from him.

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.630
Mark...

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:15.090
Darling.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.780
- You better go home.
- Why, Mark?

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.660
Because you're a sucker
for wrong guys like Ken and me.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.370
You're not wrong.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:41.820
I trust you with my whole heart.

01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:45.990
I'm glad you told me about your father.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.330
You're not like him.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.090
I know it.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.340
Thanks. I've figured out what to do.

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:57.350
About your dad.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.220
What?

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:05.350
Don't ask any questions.
I've got to do things a certain way.

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:09.720
- You look tired. Get some sleep.
- Thanks.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.820
I'm not afraid any more.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.530
Everything's going to be all right,
isn't it?

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:17.020
Sure. It'll turn out all right.

01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:24.710
- So long.
- I'll wait here for you.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.600
- OK, Mac.
- You... you oughta be more delicate.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.140
I almost hit my head on the door.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.350
That's OK, Willie, the cab's insured.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.600
I wasn't doing nothin', Mr Dixon,
just readin' my paper, that's all.

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:53.280
I'm not interested in that.
You're up for parole violation Monday.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.700
- I know.
- Three more years, isn't it?

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.030
- That's right.
- Would you like to duck that?

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.620
You can't do nothin', Mr Dixon.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:05.450
I can say I sent you up to Scalise's
hotel, using you for a stoolie.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.370
Yeah?

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.080
Particularly if you prove it.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.170
Like how?

01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:15.250
- Don't play dumb!
- By squealin' about Morrison?

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.470
No, by telling me where Scalise is.
You're gonna tell me, Willie,

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:23.670
and save yourself three years
and a lot of trouble, bad trouble.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:26.270
- Come on.
- What d'you call this, good trouble?

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:27.810
You're asking for it,

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:30.470
- and you're gonna get it.
- Wait, wait! Wait.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.810
- They'll kill me, Mr Dixon.
- Where's Scalise?

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.280
I gotta find out first.
A telephone, let me get to a telephone.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.070
OK.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.580
- Hey, Mac, pull up at that bar.
- OK.

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:48.580
- Keep the change, Mac.
- Thank you, Mr Dixon.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.500
Don't push me, they'll catch on.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.600
Get in that booth. I won't listen.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:20.150
Hello?

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.820
Hello, this is Willie Bender.
Who's this, Kramer?

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.990
Listen, Kramer,
I'm hangin' here by a shoelace.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.500
What do you mean, what do I mean?
Mark Dixon is on my neck!

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.670
He's right outside the booth.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.590
No, no, he can't hear nothin'.
He wants to see Scalise.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:40.090
What's the idea calling here?
Ain't you got any brains in your head?

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.090
That copper'll grab this number.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.060
- Who is it?
- Willie Bender. Dixon's got to him.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.850
This is Scalise. Is Dixon alone?

01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:53.150
It's OK, Willie.

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.520
Now, get this straight.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:58.860
I'd like to see Mr Dixon,
but all by himself.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.860
Here's the way I want you to work it.

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:07.790
Write this down, so if he's watching you
he'll know it's on the square.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.330
Hold it just a second.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:13.670
Go ahead.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:17.170
Tell him I'll meet him
under the following conditions.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.760
Yeah.

01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:24.680
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.000
Yeah.

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.180
OK, I got it.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:30.850
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.050
What did Scalise say?

01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:38.070
I wasn't conversin' with Scalise,
I was talkin' to Kramer.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:40.740
He says he'll contact Scalise
in an hour,

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.860
and you should be in the East River
Drive across from Bellevue at 3:00am.

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:49.540
If everything's OK, he'll pick you up
there. He says you gotta come alone.

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.910
- What else?
- That's all.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.750
- Thanks.
- Uh, what about my parole?

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:56.910
I done everything I could.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.300
Hello, Blue Star Service?

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.250
Send a messenger to the Greystone
Hotel. You know where it is.

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:54.640
Have him wait in the lobby.
The name is Dixon, Mark Dixon.

01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:57.060
Right away.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.170
'Inspector Nicholas Foley.

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:38.190
'Dear Sir,

01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:42.860
'I didn't have the guts to tell you this
while I was alive,

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:47.820
'because I didn't want to end up
like Sandy Dixon's kid.

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:57.120
'That's what every hood in New York
calls me: Sandy Dixon's kid,

01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:00.710
'and even in the department
behind my back.

01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:09.430
'I wanted to end up as a cop
and that's what I'm going to do.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.460
'I killed Kenneth Paine.
It was an accident.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.320
'I went in to pinch him.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.230
'He slugged me, I hit back.

01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:33.530
'How was I to know he had
a silver plate in his head?

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.370
'But I covered it up like a mobster,

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:50.000
'because I couldn't shake loose
from what I was.

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:53.680
'Now I'm shaking loose.

01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:58.220
'I'm going to get Scalise for you.

01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:04.060
'He's a hood, like my old man was.

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:12.070
'You won't have to worry about
pinning the Morrison killing on him.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:17.490
'You can pull him in for mine,

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.410
'and that will square things all around.

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.960
'Sincerely, Mark Dixon.'

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.160
Where's Scalise?

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:52.540
Scalise ain't here.
He left a message for you.

01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:55.670
What is the message?

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:58.330
He's willing to see you
under certain conditions.

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.550
What conditions?

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.130
You gotta park your gun.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.220
- Where is he?
- We got instructions.

01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:10.520
It's no go with a rod.

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:17.430
Put it down here.

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.690
Anything else?

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.530
- We gotta frisk you.
- Go ahead. We're wasting time.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.500
- He's clean.
- Come on.

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.170
It's OK.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.350
Sit down, Mr Dixon.

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.440
I told the boys you'd come alone.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.230
That's because I understand you,
Mr Dixon.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.400
What I don't understand

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.890
is your reason for calling on me
at this time.

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:05.030
I said sit down.

01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:08.610
I never saw a man
as full of hate as you.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.740
I consider it almost humorous

01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:13.330
the way you came hot-footing it
after me alone.

01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:15.660
I'm in the clear on the Morrison job.

01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:18.630
The police are satisfied
to let me alone,

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:21.590
but you're still hot on my neck
as always.

01:27:21.710 --> 01:27:25.510
Sit down, Dixon. I'm not kiddin'.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.680
It don't add up, Dixon,
you stayin' on my neck like this.

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:36.770
Maybe you thought you could start me
running by coming after me.

01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:42.020
Well, we're not running, Dixon. We're
all fixed to leave tomorrow morning,

01:27:42.150 --> 01:27:44.950
passports in order and everything.

01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.320
And I'm leavin' you locked in here.

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:50.120
It'll give us something to laugh about.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.450
You sitting here for a couple of days

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.460
trying desperately to attract attention.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.630
It'll maybe give the department
a laugh too.

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.750
Well, go ahead, Mr Dixon.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.340
You came out here for something.
Let's hear what it is.

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.960
You've got something on your mind,
the way you look, Mr Dixon.

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:10.140
I'm gonna give you some advice,

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.350
and you'd better listen carefully.

01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.930
You start mussin' me up
and you're gonna get it, d'you hear?

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.650
You'll only throw one punch
and they'll let you have it.

01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:21.770
I've given them instructions.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.280
- Hold it. No more shooting.
- He asked for it.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.320
Sure. Sure, he asked for it.

01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:32.660
That's what he came here for:
so we should rub him out.

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.900
He's crazy.
I saw when I looked in his eyes.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.670
Kramer, get your stuff, fix him up.

01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.670
That's a fancy way
of trying to frame somebody,

01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:43.840
getting yourself knocked off.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.720
A guy's gotta be
out of his head for that.

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:52.930
I didn't know a guy could hate
that much, not even you.

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:56.550
And all because your old man
set me up in business.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.140
I got it added up now, Dixon.

01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:01.270
I should've figured it last night,

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.770
when you tried to hang
the Paine job on me.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.490
You were the first cop
to get to Paine's house.

01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:10.530
You found Paine, slugged him, killed
him. You took the body to the river.

01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:12.690
You had to slug a night watchman.

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:16.320
And you've been walkin' around
ever since, half cop and half killer.

01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:18.710
The man who hates crooks.

01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:21.540
The law that works by itself.

01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:24.540
The cop who can't stand
to see a killer loose.

01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:28.354
So what is he?
A hood and a mobster like his old man.

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.720
It's interesting how blood will tell.

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:39.390
Your old man would've been proud of you,

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.100
to see how you finally followed
in his footsteps.

01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:45.730
You and me oughta get friendly
when you're on your feet again, Dixon.

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:48.320
There are a lot of things
a smart cop could do for me.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.110
They got Steve, beat it out of him.
He let go the works about Morrison.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.570
- Come on!
- I haven't finished the bandage.

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:57.290
Let him bleed. Come on!

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.260
Get the elevator.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.470
- Open the door! It's stuck.
- What's going on?

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.120
- Press the emergency button.
- Power's off.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.220
We're stuck!

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.530
That dirty cop.

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.320
Can't change, can you?

01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:20.660
Always have to break orders,
always have to do things your way.

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.490
This time I've got to hand it to you.
You hit the nail on the head.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.000
Thanks, Inspector.

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:29.630
Mark.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.970
They're letting Dad out.

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:37.090
I don't know what to say, but thanks.

01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:39.720
He didn't do it single-handed,
Miss Taylor.

01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:44.230
The department contributed towards
establishing your father's innocence.

01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:46.350
Not that I'm not proud of you, Mark.

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:50.650
I'm putting you back where you were
and recommending you for promotion.

01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:53.100
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Here's your letter back.

01:31:53.230 --> 01:31:56.480
Since there was no report
of your death, I didn't open it.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.770
You expected to die!

01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:03.370
I don't think Mr Dixon knows
what he expected.

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:05.860
He was pretty sore at me
when he wrote this.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.460
I think he's in a different mood now.
Tear it up, Mark, no hard feelings.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.660
And take a rest, till your arm heals.

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.220
Dad's waiting, Mark.
Will you come home with us?

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.250
Sounds like a nice holiday
for a change, Mark.

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:23.890
Go on, you've earned it.

01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:38.690
I'd like you to open the letter,
Inspector.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.270
You're sure?

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:43.290
Yes, sir. Open it.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.560
What is it?

01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.650
Mark!

01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:19.270
That clears up both cases.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.520
You're under arrest, Mark.

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:24.860
No! What is it?

01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:27.000
Please tell me, Mark.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.080
Would you mind
letting her read the letter?

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:42.300
Report to Lieutenant Thomas.
I'll make the charge myself.

01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:43.850
Yes, sir.

01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:56.150
Mark!

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.820
Goodbye, Morgan.

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:05.370
No, Mark. They'll believe you.
They must believe you.

01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:07.700
It was an accident, a mistake.

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:10.960
Anybody can make a mistake.

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.630
You mean you'll give
Sandy Dixon's kid another chance?

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.630
Every chance in the world.

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:24.300
That's enough to live for.
So long, Morgan.

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:27.060
So long, darling.
