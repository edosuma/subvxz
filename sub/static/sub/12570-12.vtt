WEBVTT

00:03.459 --> 00:04.876
(GASPS) Yes!

00:04.918 --> 00:06.168
I just got accepted

00:06.169 --> 00:07.417
into an amazing

00:04.918 --> 00:07.417
acting class.

00:07.459 --> 00:08.835
Thank goodness, because

00:08.836 --> 00:10.209
the process of getting in

00:07.459 --> 00:10.209
was totally draining.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.209
- Did you have to do
- a bunch of auditions?

00:12.250 --> 00:13.418
No, the tuition totally

00:13.419 --> 00:14.584
drained my bank account.

00:15.792 --> 00:16.876
Here you go.

00:16.918 --> 00:18.042
That'll be $10.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.792
- Uh, these aren't
- what I ordered.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.334
Well, we don't have "organic

00:22.335 --> 00:23.500
dragon fruit, humanely

00:21.167 --> 00:23.500
harvested bee pollen,"

00:23.542 --> 00:24.876
or "unpasteurized yak's milk".

00:24.877 --> 00:26.209
So you get blueberry.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.168
Have you ever heard the

00:29.169 --> 00:31.042
expression, "The customer

00:27.292 --> 00:31.042
is always right"?

00:31.083 --> 00:32.563
Have you ever heard

00:32.564 --> 00:34.042
the expression,

00:31.083 --> 00:34.042
"Ticking off your server

00:34.083 --> 00:35.684
- "is a one-way ticket
- to loogie town"?

00:36.083 --> 00:37.083
Keep the change.

00:38.918 --> 00:40.084
Hey, Zuri!

00:40.085 --> 00:41.250
How about a sweet smoothie

00:41.292 --> 00:42.334
from your smooth sweetie?

00:42.335 --> 00:43.375
(CHUCKLES)

00:44.083 --> 00:46.042
You're not my sweetie, Stuart.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.709
Just because I said I'd meet

00:47.710 --> 00:49.334
you in the park doesn't mean

00:46.083 --> 00:49.334
we're a couple.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.605
(STUTTERS) I think you're

00:50.606 --> 00:51.834
reading too much into

00:49.375 --> 00:51.834
this simple gesture.

00:52.334 --> 00:54.605
Really? Then why does it

00:54.606 --> 00:56.876
say, "Mrs. Stuart Wooten"

00:52.334 --> 00:56.876
on the side of my cup?

00:57.500 --> 00:59.126
Are you suggesting

00:59.127 --> 01:00.751
I take your last name?

00:57.500 --> 01:00.751
How progressive.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.209
I once dated a guy

01:03.210 --> 01:04.334
who took my last name.

01:04.375 --> 01:05.584
And my first name.

01:05.585 --> 01:06.792
He was an identity thief.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.626
Long story short, I put

01:08.627 --> 01:10.417
someone named Marvin through

You're a Libra?

Yeah! How did you know?

02:27.709 --> 02:29.376
Well, you're obviously

02:29.377 --> 02:31.042
artistic, and friendly...

02:31.083 --> 02:33.364

River Stevens,

02:41.607 --> 02:43.751
our acting teacher,

02:39.459 --> 02:43.751
is a total weirdo.

02:45.876 --> 02:47.355
So, how do you

02:47.356 --> 02:48.834
know so much about him,

02:45.876 --> 02:48.834
random scruffy dude?

02:49.959 --> 02:51.001
Because I am not

02:51.002 --> 02:52.042
a fellow student.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.042
- Oh! Did you sneak
- in here without paying?

02:54.083 --> 02:55.724
- Man, I wish I knew
- that was an option!

02:56.083 --> 02:58.792
I am Stevens, comma, River!

02:59.042 --> 03:01.438
And I will guide you

03:01.439 --> 03:03.834
through the art of being.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.792
Someone should

03:06.793 --> 03:08.417
guide him through

03:05.167 --> 03:08.417
the art of bathing.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.001
Bathing is for

03:37.792 --> 03:39.000
Better!

03:39.042 --> 03:40.125
That guy's, like, 90.

03:41.751 --> 03:43.626
Welcome to the team, Shane!

03:43.667 --> 03:45.768
- Our next performance is going - to be
a benefit in the park - This weekend.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.918
That sounds great.

03:46.919 --> 03:48.042
What's the worthy cause?

03:48.584 --> 03:50.126
I think it's to help

03:50.127 --> 03:51.667
homeless whales...

03:52.792 --> 03:54.185
- Can't they just
- live in the ocean?

03:54.209 --> 03:56.129
- You should bring that up
- at the next meeting.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.209
Oh, shopkeep!

04:01.918 --> 04:03.855
We will have one

04:03.856 --> 04:05.792
Pomegranate Passion

04:01.918 --> 04:05.792
smoothie with two straws.

Stuart, you gotta stop

turning every time we hang

04:10.083 --> 04:15.083
out into a romantic date.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.041
It's disturbing.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.083
I know, right?

04:18.584 --> 04:19.791
Who would go there?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.000
That would be a stupid

04:18.584 --> 04:21.000
place to go!

04:23.792 --> 04:25.042
Don't take it personally,

04:25.083 --> 04:26.334
I'm just not looking

04:26.335 --> 04:27.584
for a guy right now.

04:29.209 --> 04:31.501
Whoa, look at that guy!

04:31.502 --> 04:33.792
Mama like!

04:37.918 --> 04:39.417
This is great.

04:39.459 --> 04:41.310
- My horoscope said I was going
- to make a new friend today.

04:41.334 --> 04:43.167
I'm just glad it's you and not

04:43.168 --> 04:45.000
that lady in the park who was

04:41.334 --> 04:45.000
marrying a tree.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.059
- Don't judge. You try dating
- in New York for a few years,

04:48.083 --> 04:50.000
- See what you - end up settling for.

04:53.542 --> 04:57.000
eat a guest in, like, a week.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.709
I'm not scared.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.189
I've just never seen

05:02.190 --> 05:04.626
an Asian water monitor

04:59.751 --> 05:04.626
in person before!

05:04.667 --> 05:06.000
She's gorgeous!

05:06.292 --> 05:07.751
Compared to what?

05:09.751 --> 05:11.417
I will have you know,

05:11.418 --> 05:13.083
water monitors were voted the

05:09.751 --> 05:13.083
second most attractive reptile

05:13.125 --> 05:14.834
in Lizard Lovers Monthly.

05:14.876 --> 05:16.501
Behind iguanas.

05:16.502 --> 05:18.125
Apparently, they are the

05:14.876 --> 05:18.125
reptilian George Clooney.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.626
- I have a pet chameleon
- named Brando.

05:21.667 --> 05:22.897
He's brilliant!

05:22.898 --> 05:24.125
He can blend

05:21.667 --> 05:24.125
into anything.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.167
Except camouflage,

05:25.168 --> 05:26.168
which is odd.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.022
It is so exciting to meet

05:29.023 --> 05:30.959
a fellow lizard enthusiast!

05:31.000 --> 05:32.959
- So, what does your
- little one like to eat?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.042
Cockroaches.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.167
Oh!

05:35.168 --> 05:36.250
Are cockroaches nutritious?

05:36.292 --> 05:37.668
I don't know, but they're

05:37.669 --> 05:39.042
free and my apartment

05:36.292 --> 05:39.042
is crawling with them.

05:40.334 --> 05:41.751
Oh! Remind me never to wear

05:41.752 --> 05:43.167
open-toed shoes at your place.

05:40.334 --> 05:43.167
Hmm.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.897
Okay, guys.

05:46.898 --> 05:48.709
Let's get warmed up and

05:45.083 --> 05:48.709
then take it from the top.

05:48.751 --> 05:49.855
I know what'll get

05:49.856 --> 05:50.959
you warmed up.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.334
A nice foot massage.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.604
You don't wanna do that.

05:56.605 --> 05:58.083
I haven't changed my socks

05:55.125 --> 05:58.083
in a week.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.292
It's like a swamp down there.

06:01.709 --> 06:02.896
Well then, just call

06:02.897 --> 06:04.083
me Bayou Betty!

06:06.083 --> 06:08.042
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
- Excuse us for a second.

06:09.959 --> 06:11.042
Zuri.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.042
We really need to focus here.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.605
Oh, I'm focused.

06:14.606 --> 06:16.125
You can believe that.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.563
Give me a wheatgrass shot

06:20.564 --> 06:22.000
and keep 'em coming, sister.

06:22.918 --> 06:24.000
I am down in the dumps.

06:25.626 --> 06:26.647
If you're looking to

06:26.648 --> 06:27.667
avoid the dumps, I do not

06:25.626 --> 06:27.667
recommend wheatgrass.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.042
- Girl troubles?
- It's Zuri.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.397
It appears there's nothing

06:32.398 --> 06:33.709
I can do to get her to become

06:33.751 --> 06:34.959
enamored of my winsome,

06:34.960 --> 06:36.167
bespectacled visage.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.230
I am so sorry. I think.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.334
I'm actually not sure

06:37.125 --> 06:41.334
what that meant.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.334
It means she likes that

06:43.375 --> 06:45.250
dancing dimwit more than me.

06:45.292 --> 06:46.709
EMMA: (SIGHS) Stuart.

06:46.751 --> 06:48.522
Zuri likes you.

06:48.523 --> 06:50.292
She just doesn't

06:46.751 --> 06:50.292
like you, like you.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.042
- You're stuck in
- the friend zone.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.042
Is that bad?

06:53.083 --> 06:54.125
It's a loveless prison.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.167
I just don't get what

06:57.168 --> 06:58.250
she sees in him.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.042
- Oh, Shane, your
- shoelace is untied.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.459
Oh, thanks, bro.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.772
I almost went

07:03.773 --> 07:05.042
from a break dancer

07:02.500 --> 07:05.042
to a broken dancer.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.959
(LAUGHING) Broken dancer!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.834
That's hilarious!

07:08.876 --> 07:10.834
- Where do you come
- up with this stuff?

07:12.042 --> 07:13.101
- She seems to
- think he's funny.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.751
Girls do like funny guys.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.083
I can be funny.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.125
On purpose?

07:18.667 --> 07:20.908
- You'll see. - I'm going to go put
- On my comedy pants!

07:24.918 --> 07:26.268
- Thanks for coming to see
- me do my thing, Ravi.

07:26.292 --> 07:27.292
You've always been very

07:27.293 --> 07:28.293
supportive of my career.

07:28.334 --> 07:30.167
Until you can report it

07:30.168 --> 07:32.000
to the IRS, it is hardly

07:28.334 --> 07:32.000
a career.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.626
Uh... Is Abbey around?

07:34.627 --> 07:36.042
I have a book for her.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.042
- Oh, Ravi, just because
- Abbey owns a lizard

07:38.083 --> 07:39.501
Doesn't mean that she wants

07:39.502 --> 07:40.918
to sit around all day reading

07:38.083 --> 07:40.918
about them.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.876
(GASPS) No way!

07:43.083 --> 07:44.126
Is that a first edition

07:44.127 --> 07:45.167
Chameleons of Cameroon?

07:45.209 --> 07:46.584
I can't wait to sit around

07:46.585 --> 07:47.959
all day reading this.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.375
I stand corrected.

07:52.334 --> 07:54.185
- Ravi, we really need to get - Brando and
Mrs. Kipling - Together for a playdate.

07:54.209 --> 07:56.375
That is a splendid idea!

07:56.417 --> 07:58.314
It would be great for

07:58.315 --> 08:00.209
Mrs. Kipling to have some

07:56.417 --> 08:00.209
friends of her own species.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.250
Aw! That makes two of you.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.230
I have some exciting news

08:06.231 --> 08:08.292
for you, aspiring screen

08:04.167 --> 08:08.292
artists!

08:08.334 --> 08:10.167
You've discovered deodorant?

08:10.209 --> 08:11.959
Better.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.584
I'm going to be in

08:13.585 --> 08:15.167
an independent film,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.167
A Portrait of Sadness.

08:15.209 --> 08:17.646
It's a brilliant rumination

08:17.647 --> 08:20.083
on man's fragile relationship

08:15.209 --> 08:20.083
with mortality.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.042
The director is looking

08:22.083 --> 08:23.334
for his female lead.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.751
He has agreed to audition

08:24.752 --> 08:26.125
some of my students.

08:26.167 --> 08:27.709
Either of you

08:27.710 --> 08:29.250
would be perfect.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.398
- If I get my dad on the phone,
- would you repeat that to him?

08:33.082 --> 08:34.501
Now I urge you ladies

08:34.501 --> 08:35.918
to make bold,

08:35.958 --> 08:37.520
out-of-the-box choices

08:37.522 --> 08:39.082
with this character.

08:39.125 --> 08:41.125
For instance, in the film,

08:41.126 --> 08:43.125
I will be portraying

08:39.125 --> 08:43.125
a dog walker

08:43.167 --> 08:45.876
with a deep, dark secret...

08:47.042 --> 08:48.500
He's really a cat person.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.375
Okay. Good luck, artists!

08:55.250 --> 08:56.293
Wow, this is going

08:56.294 --> 08:57.334
to be awkward.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.042
- We're both going up
- for the same role.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.605
I know.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.125
Okay, let's

08:59.083 --> 09:02.125
make a pact.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.689
We have to promise each

09:03.690 --> 09:05.209
other that we will not

09:02.167 --> 09:05.209
let our careers

09:05.250 --> 09:06.792
- get in the way
- of our friendship.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.105
Deal!

09:08.106 --> 09:09.375
I never let my career get in

09:06.834 --> 09:09.375
the way of my personal life.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.709
Considering your last audition

09:11.710 --> 09:14.000
was 10 months ago, it has not

09:09.417 --> 09:14.000
exactly been a struggle.

09:15.209 --> 09:16.855
You are making it really hard

09:16.856 --> 09:18.500
for me to care about your next

09:15.209 --> 09:18.500
"big" chess match.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.292
Bertram, what are you doing?

09:25.334 --> 09:26.709
Just settling in

09:26.710 --> 09:28.083
for the night with an

09:25.334 --> 09:28.083
American literary classic.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.313
"An Illustrated History

09:30.314 --> 09:31.375
of Boy Bands"?

09:32.667 --> 09:33.959
It came with a free

09:33.960 --> 09:35.250
coupon for skinny jeans.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.626
Well, I have

09:38.627 --> 09:40.167
a very important

09:37.083 --> 09:40.167
guest coming over.

09:40.209 --> 09:41.751
So let me give

09:41.752 --> 09:43.292
you one direction.

09:40.209 --> 09:43.292
Get out.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.167
Why should I?

09:47.209 --> 09:49.230
Because if you don't, I'll

09:49.231 --> 09:51.250
make you do your job, and

09:47.209 --> 09:51.250
wait on us hand and foot.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.083
See ya! Have fun!

09:55.167 --> 09:56.314
This is gonna be

09:56.315 --> 09:57.459
a night to remember.

09:59.209 --> 10:00.250
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

10:03.083 --> 10:04.542
Wow...

10:04.543 --> 10:06.000
Okay, this is

10:03.083 --> 10:06.000
just wrong.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.209
I know. There were supposed

10:09.210 --> 10:11.334
to be doves, but they were

10:07.083 --> 10:11.334
all sold out.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.334
Stupid spring weddings.

10:14.292 --> 10:15.646
Hey, Zuri!

10:15.647 --> 10:17.000
Have you seen Sha...

10:17.042 --> 10:18.375
Hey!

10:19.083 --> 10:20.376
What's, uh...

10:20.377 --> 10:21.667
What's going on here?

10:22.167 --> 10:24.000
- This is not what
- it looks like!

10:24.250 --> 10:26.042
- It looks like Zuri
- tricked you into

10:26.083 --> 10:27.101
- Coming out here,
- so she can have

10:27.125 --> 10:28.417
A romantic dinner with you.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.000
- Oh. Then it's exactly
- what it looks like.

10:32.417 --> 10:34.314
I told you, Shane

10:34.315 --> 10:36.209
is off-limits! Ooh, muffins!

10:41.209 --> 10:42.209
(SIGHS)

10:43.083 --> 10:44.125
Hello, angel.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.083
Stuart, what are

10:46.084 --> 10:47.084
you doing here?

10:47.125 --> 10:50.292
I'm here to tickle your...

10:51.167 --> 10:52.709
Funny bone!

10:54.709 --> 10:55.709
Really?

10:56.792 --> 10:57.918
Hang on, hang on,

10:57.919 --> 10:59.042
I'm getting a call.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.250
Let me answer it on my...

11:01.292 --> 11:03.000
Bluetooth!

11:06.167 --> 11:08.209
Keep it up with the prop

11:08.210 --> 11:10.250
comedy, and that'll be the

11:06.167 --> 11:10.250
only tooth you have left.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.042
Oh! Oh, come on, don't be a...

11:14.083 --> 11:16.167
Party pooper!

11:19.709 --> 11:21.042
"Billy,

11:21.083 --> 11:22.125
"I need you to be strong.

And scene.

11:36.209 --> 11:37.626
Jessie.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.084
You do understand

11:39.085 --> 11:40.500
that the truck crushed

11:37.667 --> 11:40.500
the dog, right?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.542
Right. Well, River

11:42.543 --> 11:44.000
said to make (MIMICKING)

11:41.083 --> 11:44.000
out-of-the-box choices.

11:44.334 --> 11:45.626
So...

11:45.667 --> 11:47.043
My character, whenever

11:47.044 --> 11:48.417
she has to deliver bad news,

11:48.459 --> 11:49.584
she just dissolves

11:49.585 --> 11:50.709
into laughter.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.844
- Maybe it's her way of
- softening the blow.

11:53.334 --> 11:54.959
- Jessie!
- Hmm?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.771
Do you know what happened to

11:56.772 --> 11:58.542
my Boyz II Men limited edition

11:55.000 --> 11:58.542
collector plates?

11:59.792 --> 12:01.001
Bertram, I need you

12:01.002 --> 12:02.209
to be strong.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.313
(GIGGLING) I broke them

12:04.314 --> 12:05.542
this morning, while

12:03.083 --> 12:05.542
I was cleaning.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.084
(LAUGHING) I know they

12:07.085 --> 12:08.584
meant a lot to you and

12:05.584 --> 12:08.584
I'm really sorry.

12:10.876 --> 12:13.001
I should be mad, but your

12:13.002 --> 12:15.125
laughter really seemed to

12:10.876 --> 12:15.125
soften the blow. (CHUCKLES)

12:18.167 --> 12:19.584
Oh, you're good.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.709
Guess what?

12:23.751 --> 12:26.167
Zuri hated my prop comedy.

12:26.209 --> 12:27.209
Shocking.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.814
Your problem is Zuri is

12:30.815 --> 12:32.626
totally crushing on Shane

12:29.000 --> 12:32.626
because he's a great dancer.

12:33.209 --> 12:34.727
- Too bad you can't
- compete with that.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.709
Or can I?

12:37.792 --> 12:40.042
Get it? Can? Eye?

12:41.834 --> 12:42.834
We're closed.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.876
Jessie, Abbey, let's see your

12:48.877 --> 12:50.417
audition scenes for the movie.

12:50.459 --> 12:52.250
I dare you to wow me.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.167
You want a little

12:55.168 --> 12:56.250
more time, Jessie?

12:54.083 --> 12:56.250
I can go first.

12:56.292 --> 12:57.355
Aw, thanks.

12:57.356 --> 12:58.417
That'll give me more

12:56.292 --> 12:58.417
time to go over it.

12:58.459 --> 12:59.584
Then find a script that's

12:59.585 --> 13:00.709
not covered in palm sweat.

12:58.459 --> 13:00.709
Yeah.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.042
Do it, Abbey!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.105
You are the greatest

13:04.106 --> 13:05.125

What? You made it very

13:08.731 --> 13:10.542

13:06.918 --> 13:10.542
take me to Lizard-Con!

13:28.919 --> 13:30.751
even saw that monster

13:27.083 --> 13:30.751

13:30.792 --> 13:32.334
Brava!

13:33.125 --> 13:35.063
Abbey, what a brave choice,

13:35.064 --> 13:37.000
I am wowed.

13:39.459 --> 13:41.083
No. That was my choice!

13:41.959 --> 13:43.760
- Where's a monster truck
- when you need one?

13:46.209 --> 13:48.105
Jessie, Abbey, here's

13:48.106 --> 13:50.000
the audition schedule

13:46.209 --> 13:50.000
for this afternoon.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.250
Break a leg!

13:52.209 --> 13:53.397
You know, I once broke

13:53.398 --> 13:54.584
my own leg, on purpose,

13:54.626 --> 13:56.397
when I auditioned for the

13:56.398 --> 13:58.167
role of a cage fighter in

13:54.626 --> 13:58.167
League of Blood.

13:59.876 --> 14:00.960
So inspiring.

14:00.961 --> 14:02.042
Did you get the part?

14:02.083 --> 14:03.417
No. I couldn't walk.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.250
My leg was broken.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.834
Okay, good luck, artists.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.709
Yeah, well, some people don't

14:12.710 --> 14:14.334
need luck when they have

14:11.083 --> 14:14.334
treachery and deceit...

14:14.375 --> 14:16.334
- And split ends.
- Yeah, I went there.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.376
Hey, I'm a Gemini.

14:19.377 --> 14:21.250
FYI, we're two-faced.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.918
Yeah, well, does either face

14:22.919 --> 14:24.334
remember we said

14:21.500 --> 14:24.334
we wouldn't let our careers

14:24.375 --> 14:26.125
- get in the way
- of our friendship?

14:26.167 --> 14:28.022
Sorry, Jessie.

14:28.023 --> 14:29.876
Clearly, it was written in the

14:26.167 --> 14:29.876
stars that I get this part.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.418
Well, if you use

14:31.419 --> 14:32.709
my character in

14:30.125 --> 14:32.709
that audition,

14:32.751 --> 14:34.189
it'll just show

14:34.190 --> 14:35.626
that you don't have

14:32.751 --> 14:35.626
any character.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.834

14:38.000 --> 14:40.360

- as much as I thought it would.

- You have bad hair!
- (CHUCKLES)

14:45.167 --> 14:46.251

all the proceeds go to help

14:48.919 --> 14:50.459
save homeless whales.

14:52.209 --> 14:53.772
Actually, I found out

14:53.773 --> 14:55.334
it's to rehabilitate

14:52.209 --> 14:55.334
injured rhinos.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.522
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

14:56.523 --> 14:57.667

15:50.918 --> 15:56.542
back my boo's heart.

Stuart, I am not your boo.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.000
Also... Boo!

some padding in those pants,

16:54.667 --> 16:55.667
(RETCHING)

16:56.334 --> 16:57.834
Ugh! (LAUGHS)

16:58.083 --> 16:59.376
I actually enjoyed that

16:59.377 --> 17:00.667
more than his dancing.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.250
(ALL LAUGHING)

17:04.083 --> 17:05.396
No nibbling until

17:05.397 --> 17:06.709
the company gets here.

17:06.751 --> 17:08.751
And no nibbling the company.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.500
(GROWLS)

17:10.541 --> 17:11.584
Hey, Ravi.

17:11.626 --> 17:13.500
Abbey, Brando! Welcome!

17:13.541 --> 17:14.792
Thanks for having us over,

17:14.794 --> 17:16.041
even though things between

17:16.083 --> 17:17.188
Jessie and me

17:17.189 --> 17:18.291
are a little tense.

17:18.334 --> 17:19.791
Mrs. Kipling made me

17:19.792 --> 17:21.250
pinky swear to keep

17:18.334 --> 17:21.250
our playdate.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.876
And by that, I mean,

17:22.877 --> 17:24.459
if I did not, she swore

17:21.291 --> 17:24.459
she would bite off my pinky.

17:25.584 --> 17:26.814
Actually, I'm glad

17:26.815 --> 17:28.041
that Jessie's not here,

17:28.083 --> 17:29.834
- 'cause I wanted
- to ask you a favor.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.459
- Of course,
- you are my only...

17:31.959 --> 17:33.459
I mean, one of

17:33.460 --> 17:34.959
my many, many friends.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.918
- And friends help
- each other, right?

17:37.959 --> 17:38.959
I have read that.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.250
So...

17:42.167 --> 17:43.768
- Do you think you could - help me make
sure Jessie - Doesn't make that audition?

17:43.792 --> 17:45.126
(GASPS) You want me

17:45.127 --> 17:46.459
to knock off my nanny?

17:47.042 --> 17:48.876
No! No!

17:48.918 --> 17:50.272
I just wanted you to tell her

17:50.273 --> 17:51.626
the audition has been pushed

17:48.918 --> 17:51.626
back a few hours.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.334
- But remind me
- never to cross you.

17:54.626 --> 17:56.105
But I love Jessie!

17:56.106 --> 17:57.584
I cannot sabotage her!

17:57.626 --> 17:59.793
Ravi, if I get this part,

17:59.794 --> 18:01.959
my career will take off.

18:02.167 --> 18:04.000
- And what about
- Jessie's career?

18:04.792 --> 18:05.792
Just think of it.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.230
You, me, Kipling

18:08.231 --> 18:10.375
and Brando,

18:10.417 --> 18:12.917
slithering down the green,

18:12.918 --> 18:15.417
scaly carpet together at

18:10.417 --> 18:15.417
Lizard-Con.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.564
Mmm, very well,

18:17.565 --> 18:19.334
I shall do it!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.168
I cannot wait to hear

18:21.169 --> 18:22.334
the roar of the crowd.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.168
The last time I had people

18:24.169 --> 18:25.959
cheer for me was when I quit

18:22.375 --> 18:25.959
the basketball team.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.772
Here you go, Stuart.

18:30.773 --> 18:32.042
You should really hydrate.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.042
- You lost a lot of
- fluids up there.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.209
And there,

18:35.210 --> 18:36.334
and over there.

18:39.542 --> 18:40.542
Stuart.

18:41.918 --> 18:43.147
I know this is difficult

18:43.148 --> 18:44.375
for you, much like dancing...

18:45.417 --> 18:47.209
But Shane and I are a thing.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.000
And you need to accept that.

18:49.751 --> 18:52.042
Whoa, slow your roll.

18:52.751 --> 18:54.000
You freak me out.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.375
What do you mean, snuggle-bug?

18:58.083 --> 19:00.000
That is what I mean!

19:00.876 --> 19:02.188
You follow me around,

19:02.189 --> 19:03.500
you tried to give me

19:00.876 --> 19:03.500
a foot massage,

19:03.542 --> 19:04.542
and then you sprung that

19:04.543 --> 19:05.543
surprise date on me.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.375
Who does that?

19:08.125 --> 19:09.876
Oh, no!

19:09.877 --> 19:11.626
Do you know

19:08.125 --> 19:11.626
what this means?

19:12.125 --> 19:13.375
I've become...

19:14.083 --> 19:15.417
Stuart.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.709
Is Stuart slang for stalker?

19:19.042 --> 19:20.042
Sort of.

19:21.626 --> 19:23.334
Listen, pal, you just made

19:23.335 --> 19:25.042
the biggest mistake of

19:21.626 --> 19:25.042
your life!

19:25.626 --> 19:27.313
Zuri is the sweetest,

19:27.314 --> 19:29.000
most beautiful girl

19:25.626 --> 19:29.000
in the world.

19:30.584 --> 19:31.709
And maybe I am stuck

19:31.710 --> 19:32.834
in the friend zone,

19:32.876 --> 19:34.252
but I'm lucky to have

19:34.253 --> 19:35.626
her in my life any way

19:32.876 --> 19:35.626
I can get her.

19:36.083 --> 19:37.522
Man, that was

19:37.523 --> 19:38.959
really beautiful.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Hmm.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.000
- And your breath
- really stinks.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.626
Aw, Stuart.

19:45.627 --> 19:47.167
That was so sweet.

19:47.209 --> 19:49.083
- I meant every word,
- my beloved.

19:49.626 --> 19:50.813
Okay, I'm getting out of

19:50.814 --> 19:52.000
here before I throw up.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.855
You know what, Stuart,

19:55.856 --> 19:57.626
now that I see what

19:54.083 --> 19:57.626
you've gone through,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.042
I think I owe you an apology.

20:00.043 --> 20:02.083
And I have something for you.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.439
A mint?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.167
Oh, man, is this it?

20:03.709 --> 20:07.167
Our first kiss!

20:07.209 --> 20:09.605
No way! Shane was right.

20:09.606 --> 20:12.000
Your breath is nasty.

20:13.542 --> 20:14.542
Oh.

20:16.042 --> 20:17.959
Aw, come here.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.167
Our first hug! Yay!

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Okay.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.231
"Poor little guy never

20:29.232 --> 20:30.626
even saw that monster

20:27.834 --> 20:30.626
truck coming." (LAUGHS)

20:33.083 --> 20:34.126
Brava, Jessie,

20:34.127 --> 20:35.167
very nice work.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.626
Hey! Ravi, you said you'd

20:36.627 --> 20:38.042
make sure Jessie was late!

20:38.083 --> 20:39.542
I would never betray

20:39.543 --> 20:41.000
my nanny just to gain

20:38.083 --> 20:41.000
a friend!

20:41.042 --> 20:42.185
- How pathetic do
- you think I am?

20:42.209 --> 20:44.000
Do not answer that!

20:45.209 --> 20:47.125
- Ravi told me all
- about your little plan.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.918
Aw, what's wrong, Abbey?

20:49.959 --> 20:51.480
Did your horoscope not mention

20:51.481 --> 20:53.000
anything about being tricked

20:49.959 --> 20:53.000
by an 11-year-old?

20:53.292 --> 20:55.000
I am 13.

20:55.792 --> 20:56.792
Really?

20:58.125 --> 20:59.209
Abbey, that was

20:59.210 --> 21:00.292
quite a gesture,

21:00.334 --> 21:02.022
letting Jessie audition with

21:02.023 --> 21:03.709
that character you created.

21:03.751 --> 21:05.584
That's what friends are for.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.542
Unfortunately, the director

21:08.543 --> 21:10.000
said it was the worst

21:07.083 --> 21:10.000
audition he's ever seen.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.083
What? You said it

21:12.084 --> 21:13.084
was a brave choice!

21:13.125 --> 21:15.000
Yes, apparently too brave.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.980
I believe his exact

21:16.981 --> 21:18.834
words were, "What kind

21:15.125 --> 21:18.834
of monster laughs

21:18.876 --> 21:20.438
"when telling an 8-year-old

21:20.439 --> 21:22.000
his dog has been flattened

21:18.876 --> 21:22.000
by a truck?"

21:23.250 --> 21:24.626
Yes! Jessie blew it!

21:24.627 --> 21:26.000
I still have a shot!

21:26.250 --> 21:28.147
Actually, Jessie's take on the

21:28.148 --> 21:30.042
character was so disturbing,

21:30.083 --> 21:31.355
the director has decided

21:31.356 --> 21:32.626
to cut it entirely.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.000
And start seeing a therapist.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.083
Way to go, hack.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.126
- Your acting's so bad,
- it cost both of us a job!

21:40.083 --> 21:42.063
Sorry, this whole friendship

21:42.064 --> 21:44.042
before career thing is gonna

21:40.083 --> 21:44.042
be hard for me.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.542
Yeah, I'm picking up on that.

21:46.459 --> 21:47.792
On the bright side,

21:47.793 --> 21:49.125
they're casting for

21:46.459 --> 21:49.125
a role uptown

21:49.167 --> 21:51.084
that you both

21:51.085 --> 21:53.000
would be perfect for.

21:49.167 --> 21:53.000
Here's the address.

21:54.209 --> 21:56.042
- See ya, friend.
- Ravi, stop her!

21:56.959 --> 21:58.085
Do not even try.

21:58.086 --> 21:59.209
Nothing can dislodge me.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.000
I am an immovable boulder!

22:05.876 --> 22:07.125
More like a portable pebble.

22:08.667 --> 22:09.855
I never want to see

22:09.856 --> 22:11.042
you again, Abbey!

22:11.083 --> 22:13.042
- Although Brando is
- always welcome.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.397
There is no reason

22:14.398 --> 22:15.709
for the lizards to suffer.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.063
You've got potential.

22:19.064 --> 22:21.042
You should join my class

22:17.083 --> 22:21.042
for nine to 11-year-olds.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.000
I am 13!

22:27.083 --> 22:28.647
See, it's a rear-view mirror!

22:28.648 --> 22:30.209
Get it?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
ALL: Oh.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.000
This is so bad.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.563
I'd actually rather

22:36.564 --> 22:38.000
do my homework.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.709
I'd throw a tomato at him,

22:40.710 --> 22:42.250
but I'm afraid he'd use it

22:39.167 --> 22:42.250
in his act.

22:44.083 --> 22:46.042
- You know, this
- isn't easy, people.

22:46.083 --> 22:48.042
I am under a tremendous...

22:48.083 --> 22:50.209
Strain up here.

22:51.334 --> 22:53.105
I hope you're happy.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.876
You've ruined colanders

22:51.334 --> 22:54.876
for me!

22:56.083 --> 22:57.397
I can't believe

22:57.398 --> 22:58.709
I apologized to you.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.584
Oh, wait! I just

23:02.585 --> 23:04.167
got party pooper!

23:04.876 --> 23:05.876
This is horrible.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.042
- Well, thanks for
- staying, Jessie.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.542
No problem.

23:11.543 --> 23:13.000
Your parents are paying

23:10.083 --> 23:13.000
me to watch you, right?

23:13.042 --> 23:14.834
- Yes.
- Then on with the show.
