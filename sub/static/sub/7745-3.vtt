00:08.718 --> 00:10.303
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.387 --> 00:12.222
Shared custody is fair. Fair is all I want.

00:12.305 --> 00:14.641
Here's what I want.
I wanna go back in a fucking time machine

00:14.724 --> 00:16.101
before you were a drug addict,

00:16.184 --> 00:18.770
and ruined our marriage
and fucked up our kids.

00:18.937 --> 00:22.691
You work on your boob-grabbing
Tourette situation on your own time.

00:22.774 --> 00:23.942
Dr. Roman to the ER.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.652
<i>Dr. Roman to the ER.</i>

00:25.735 --> 00:27.737
Time to go save some lives.

00:28.446 --> 00:31.491
Thanks for coming, Doctor,
after I've already stabilized your patient.

00:31.574 --> 00:34.536
Our new chief of the ER,
Dr. Ike Prentiss.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.747
What the fuck was that?

00:37.914 --> 00:40.792
Akalitus gives it to some guy
who started yesterday?

00:41.376 --> 00:45.672
I'm thinking it's time that I moved out
and got my own place.

00:46.339 --> 00:48.174
I thought for your birthday
I'd give you a ride home.

00:48.383 --> 00:50.427
Eddie, thanks. That's sweet.
Can I take a rain check?

00:51.261 --> 00:52.303
Sure.

00:57.517 --> 00:58.935
Where's the lady?

01:59.496 --> 02:04.626
<i>I have the experience, the tools,
and the resources I need.</i>

02:05.835 --> 02:10.423
<i>I have thought through
and prepared myself for all issues.</i>

02:11.257 --> 02:15.094
<i>I smile and cultivate the smile inside myself.</i>

02:15.845 --> 02:18.473
<i>I can do a superb job.</i>

02:19.182 --> 02:22.685
<i>My smile says, "Yes" to my success.</i>

02:22.769 --> 02:24.729
"I can do a superb job."

02:25.438 --> 02:28.691
"My smile says 'Yes' to my success."

02:32.028 --> 02:34.405
<i>Your success is your...</i>

02:42.121 --> 02:45.333
I have to hand it to both of you.
I didn't think we'd get here.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.377
You did great work to find a middle ground.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.712
Yeah, we did a superb job.

02:49.796 --> 02:51.589
- Superb. Really?
- Yeah.

02:51.673 --> 02:54.050
I mean, look at us.
A week ago we were barely speaking.

02:54.551 --> 02:58.805
Now we're speaking
and have little documents with little tabs.

03:00.849 --> 03:01.975
You need a pen?

03:02.767 --> 03:04.018
No.

03:04.102 --> 03:06.437
And we have one final piece of
business to take care of.

03:07.188 --> 03:11.109
By law and under penalty of perjury,
does either of you have any hidden assets?

03:15.989 --> 03:19.200
Should have disclosed the box of
diamond tiaras under our bed.

03:19.284 --> 03:21.369
And all my gold bullion.

03:23.413 --> 03:25.456
Can you believe we're done?

03:28.042 --> 03:29.085
New car.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.005
Take it easy. I got it used.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.465
Jeep still running okay?

03:34.549 --> 03:37.218
Yeah. I'll die before that thing does.
It's a tank.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.806
You were getting Fi early tomorrow?
She's got math lab at 7:00.

03:41.890 --> 03:42.932
She's really struggling.

03:43.057 --> 03:47.437
I don't know why she's having such trouble.
I mean, she likes school. She likes math.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.898
Well, she doesn't like multiplying fractions.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.900
Which means I've got to learn that stuff
all over again.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.443
Well, you're better at math than me.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.069
Not saying much.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.531
There's construction on the FDR.
You know how to get out of here?

03:58.615 --> 04:00.325
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

04:00.992 --> 04:02.243
Follow me.

04:04.454 --> 04:08.291
<i>I am well respected, appreciated.</i>

04:08.374 --> 04:11.461
<i>And I deserve the love and appreciation.</i>

04:11.878 --> 04:13.463
All right, that's enough of that.

04:13.838 --> 04:14.881
<i>I can do...</i>

04:27.310 --> 04:30.480
Hey. Hi, baby.

04:30.855 --> 04:31.940
Are you using?

04:33.566 --> 04:36.444
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. What are you on?

04:36.736 --> 04:38.321
I am not on anything.

04:38.404 --> 04:41.032
You were smiling all morning,
then you hit my car.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.659
I should have known it was all an act.

04:42.742 --> 04:45.703
It wasn't an act, Kevin.
It was a fucking accident.

04:45.787 --> 04:47.497
You can't believe it.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.290
We should go over there.

04:49.374 --> 04:50.917
Not it. No tag-backs.

04:51.000 --> 04:51.960
You know, without a mediator,

04:52.043 --> 04:53.753
you're a real fucking asshole,
you know that?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.088
What if that were me?

04:55.171 --> 04:56.923
If it were you, I would go over. You're easy.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.466
I don't know what you're upset about.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.260
I am upset because you are standing here
screaming at me.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.595
I am not screaming.

05:02.679 --> 05:05.932
Okay, then you're standing there
being a real asshole very loudly.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.475
I'm going. I'm going in,

05:07.558 --> 05:08.685
I can't believe it.

05:08.768 --> 05:09.852
You can't believe it?

05:09.936 --> 05:13.189
Yes, it was a fucking accident, Kevin.
I am the one in the hospital.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.899
You're always at the goddamn hospital.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.776
When I woke up this morning, I told myself,

05:16.859 --> 05:20.613
"You get up, you get through this meeting,
and then you can drive away from her."

05:20.697 --> 05:22.699
That's all I wanted, to drive away!

05:22.782 --> 05:24.534
Really? Because you asked me
to follow you.

05:26.452 --> 05:30.456
Good. Here we all are. Together again.

05:32.291 --> 05:37.088
Hello. There is a police officer
waiting in admitting

05:37.380 --> 05:39.382
to finish an accident report.

05:39.465 --> 05:42.677
Unless you would like to stay with your...

05:42.760 --> 05:43.886
Jackie.

05:44.262 --> 05:47.056
No, she's on her own.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.782
Name?

06:05.241 --> 06:06.534
No.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.662
Please? Please? This is invaluable.

06:09.746 --> 06:12.749
This is like Steve Jobs
shopping at the Apple store.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.709
Think how much we can all learn.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.087
- Age?
- Give me that chart.

06:18.171 --> 06:20.131
And this betterjust be fluids.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.342
It is. You were super dehydrated.

06:23.426 --> 06:26.012
Your air bag knocked you out
for 20 minutes.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.931
Zoey, I have whiplash
and I have a bruised rib.

06:29.015 --> 06:30.224
Discharge me, please.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.018
I can't do that.

06:32.268 --> 06:35.855
So I'm waiting? Really? I'm gonna wait...
I'm waiting for a doctor?

06:36.606 --> 06:38.107
Yes.

06:38.191 --> 06:40.276
And everyone's a little scared of you.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.946
So maybe a little less...

06:44.072 --> 06:46.365
A little more...

06:58.336 --> 06:59.420
May I?

07:10.473 --> 07:11.557
Three more seconds.

07:12.058 --> 07:14.143
I know, you know that.

07:14.227 --> 07:18.689
I just want you to be comfortable.
You can ask me for anything.

07:22.110 --> 07:24.570
<i>3e69-</i>

07:27.740 --> 07:31.369
98.6. "Normal."

07:34.705 --> 07:36.791
- Vitals are good.
- I know.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.960
Everything that everyone is saying, I know.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.545
I'm gonna have Zoey
take your blood pressure again.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.712
You can do better than this.

07:41.796 --> 07:44.674
Look, can you be a nurse for a second
and forget about my blood pressure?

07:44.757 --> 07:47.260
Will you draw my blood
and send it to Kevin, please?

07:47.510 --> 07:50.096
Can't legally send plasma through the mail.

07:50.179 --> 07:53.766
Take it. I am serious.
I am almost 10 months sober.

07:53.850 --> 07:56.269
The longest 10 months of my entire life.

07:56.352 --> 07:57.436
What happened? Why is he...

07:57.520 --> 08:00.523
Because I hit him with my car
on our way out of the lawyer's office.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.526
What, that means I'm high?

08:03.609 --> 08:04.735
You don't have to prove anything.

08:04.819 --> 08:06.946
Well, apparently I do.
Every time I screw something up,

08:07.029 --> 08:09.073
I have to prove I'm clean all over again.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tourniquet. Tourniquet.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.376
I'm gonna need a doctor to clear you
before you're back on the floor.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.254
I cannot sit here
and watch everyone else do my job.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.589
I am losing my mind.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.341
Fuck! Really? Really?

08:28.134 --> 08:30.720
Nurses are the worst goddamn patients.

08:43.983 --> 08:46.777
You know what?
I'm saying if you're wearing shoes,

08:46.903 --> 08:48.988
I don't want to see your individual toes.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.364
I agree. Never.

08:50.448 --> 08:51.824
Well, never say never.

08:51.908 --> 08:52.950
I will say never.

08:53.034 --> 08:56.829
I will say I would rather sleep with a woman
than wear athletic toe shoes.

08:56.913 --> 08:58.289
Don't move.

09:06.339 --> 09:08.841
I'm sorry. Did you just
hide from another man behind me?

09:09.091 --> 09:10.927
I did. I appreciate it.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.429
I'll get the gum.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.723
Sir, for his gum.

09:16.349 --> 09:18.059
- Thank you.
- Fresh breath for all.

09:19.018 --> 09:21.270
All right, buddy. You get to hang here

09:21.354 --> 09:24.232
'cause the guys in CT
aren't as efficient as me.

09:24.315 --> 09:26.817
We'll get you up there real soon.

09:26.901 --> 09:28.694
My God. Thank you.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.530
It's like it doesn't matter
how many alarms I set,

09:31.614 --> 09:34.367
my body rejects waking up early.

09:34.909 --> 09:37.620
How did you text me to cover for you
if you weren't awake?

09:38.704 --> 09:41.499
I pre-wrote that text last night just in case.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.876
So I was like, "What? Send."

09:43.960 --> 09:48.589
And then I got two more hours of sleep,
which was amazing because you're amazing.

09:49.382 --> 09:50.633
So amazing.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.635
Give me one of those.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.723
What? You're mad at me.

09:57.807 --> 09:59.225
- No.
- You are.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.060
- You are mad at me.
-It's just...

10:01.686 --> 10:03.896
It's been a little crazy. CT's backed up again.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.816
I have three patients who aren't,
you know, patient.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.278
Here, you get bay two.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.531
Totally. Bay two, I'm on it.

10:19.662 --> 10:20.830
Fuck.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.582
No. Really? Where is Coop? Coop!

10:23.874 --> 10:25.668
Coop, where are you?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.503
Coop!

10:30.339 --> 10:33.009
Okay, almost there.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.220
Shit. How do I get this bed just, like, up?

10:36.304 --> 10:37.930
Thor!

10:45.521 --> 10:48.316
Can you make this go away?
This thing is a beast.

10:48.399 --> 10:52.403
Sure. Hide behind me,
let me move all your machinery.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.071
I am everyone's giant.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.616
Her heart is made of stone.
Write that on her chart.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.368
My God. You're so funny. Thank you.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.254
Jesus Christ. Write this.

11:10.338 --> 11:13.632
"Patient presented no signs of
internal injuries post-accident."

11:13.716 --> 11:17.053
Then you tell me I might be in a little pain
later on so I should take it easy.

11:17.595 --> 11:19.805
Then you sign off so I can get on the floor.

11:19.889 --> 11:21.432
Sold.

11:22.058 --> 11:24.352
I am going to give you
something for the pain

11:24.435 --> 11:25.936
you will definitely be in later.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.230
Are you familiar with oxy?

11:29.565 --> 11:30.858
You're joking, right?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.861
Sorry. Of course you are. You are a nurse.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.822
Take two of these.
When you get home, get in a warm bath,

11:36.906 --> 11:38.574
you'll feel like you're on the beach
in Costa Rica.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.118
Don't fuck with the dosage.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.162
Wow.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.000
You're not allergic to anything, are you?

11:48.084 --> 11:50.002
Except an expensive haircut?

11:51.128 --> 11:53.089
I'm kidding. You're really pretty.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.884
You should smile more.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.186
Fuck.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.522
I know. I have that effect on a lot of people.

12:10.606 --> 12:11.732
I'm Sergeant Frank Verelli.

12:11.816 --> 12:13.192
I just got done
speaking with your ex-husband.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.778
I will need to see
your driver's license, please.

12:16.237 --> 12:18.906
Yes. Of course.

12:21.409 --> 12:22.993
- Okay, here it is.
- Thank you.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.623
You all right?

12:27.706 --> 12:30.835
Yeah, I'm fine. Ex-husband.
Just, nobody's called him that yet.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.838
Fresh ink.
How long have you been divorced?

12:34.255 --> 12:37.299
I don't know. Two hours, I guess. Little less.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.635
Is that why you decided to
hit him with your car?

12:41.303 --> 12:42.930
No, it was an accident, Officer.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.808
Come on, you wanted to do it.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.352
A little bit?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.479
Just a little?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.275
I'm sorry, are you flirting with me?

12:54.942 --> 12:55.985
Well, that just killed it.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.738
But you're new,
so I'm gonna give you a break, okay?

13:02.658 --> 13:06.162
I get it. Okay, real quick.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.165
Take it in.

13:13.794 --> 13:17.381
So, Jackie Peyton, what is it you do?

13:18.257 --> 13:19.758
His name's Roger. He's in and out.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.553
Forty-year-old male standing up
in a double-decker tour bus

13:22.636 --> 13:24.430
got nailed by a no-left-turn sign.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.307
Yo, I need a nurse in here!

13:29.852 --> 13:31.187
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

13:39.195 --> 13:40.738
While you're at it...

13:42.364 --> 13:43.657
Thank you.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.409
His forehead is bleeding
like a motherfucker.

13:45.493 --> 13:46.702
Yeah, he's got a pumper.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.287
I want to get CT to neuro consult.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.455
- You got my stapler?
- Yeah, it's right here.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.542
Hey, Roger. My name is Jackie.
Welcome to New York.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.045
Whoa, whoa, what is that shit?

13:56.128 --> 13:57.796
BP's 70 over 40, dropping.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.216
Guys, don't leave. Did you get a history?

14:00.299 --> 14:03.302
Yeah, no meds. His wife says he's healthy.
Never been in a hospital.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.471
Chest is clear. Bilateral breath sounds.
Roll him onto his side,

14:05.554 --> 14:08.891
see if there's anything we missed. On three.
Let's go. One, two, three.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.353
Yikes, what is that?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.647
Is that a little building?

14:14.730 --> 14:17.733
It's the Empire State Building souvenir
in his back.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.568
Yeah, we missed that.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.487
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you think?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.614
It's in there kind of deep.
What kind of heat would I get into

14:23.697 --> 14:26.492
-if I took this out right here right now?
- Please, a lot. Please don't.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.953
Let's get him propped up on his side
so he doesn't make things worse.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.538
I will call surgery.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.249
Tourists like all the wrong shit.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.876
Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.129
Hey, I was the Statue of Liberty
three years in a row for Halloween

14:39.213 --> 14:40.256
and I was born here.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.174
You got anything?

14:42.258 --> 14:44.343
These assholes upstairs are not answering.

14:45.803 --> 14:48.722
Hold on, guys. The OR is not ready.
Where are you going?

14:48.806 --> 14:50.849
I'll introduce myself.
They'll make room, trust me.

14:50.933 --> 14:54.311
You should sit down.
You were just in a car accident.

15:14.415 --> 15:15.457
Hello.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.127
So you're a nurse.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.045
Yes, I am.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.006
That's good.

15:25.009 --> 15:27.636
You know, it's the same deal at the station.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.764
You just want to sit down,
catch your breath,

15:30.848 --> 15:33.892
maybe eat a couple of Junior Mints
or talk to your kid.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.313
And then three feet away,
someone else's life as they know it is over.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.653
I got two kids. Boys. They're beautiful.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.739
Joint custody.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.074
Me and the wife, we're old pros.

15:50.159 --> 15:53.245
You need me to fill something else out
for your form or something?

15:53.329 --> 15:55.748
No. That's all done.
So you want to have dinner?

16:01.378 --> 16:03.380
I can't right now.

16:03.464 --> 16:06.133
Good, 'cause I don't want to have
dinner with you at 1:00 in the afternoon.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.015
I don't know what to say.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.284
In case you do.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.926
How are you feeling?

16:49.802 --> 16:51.470
I'm fine, Zoey.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.472
Do you want to go to lunch?

16:53.931 --> 16:56.266
Why is everyone asking me to eat?

16:58.394 --> 17:00.979
You know what? Sure.
Where do you want to go?

17:04.942 --> 17:09.822
So I'm waiting for my venti Awake tea latte
and I'm thinking,

17:09.905 --> 17:11.323
"How am I gonna find an apartment?"

17:11.407 --> 17:15.494
And I guess I said it out loud
because the guy behind me says,

17:15.577 --> 17:18.580
"I have an apartment." Isn't it insane?

17:18.664 --> 17:21.792
I'm glad New York is such a
magical place for so many people.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.711
Almost there.

17:25.671 --> 17:30.008
Technically, it's a studio plus.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.761
- Plus what?
- I know.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.349
So I gave some guy $500 to hold it for me.

17:38.434 --> 17:42.563
But I didn't want to sign anything
until you saw it.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.150
So?

17:48.736 --> 17:51.071
Yeah, it's great, Zoey.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.365
Yeah, I never lived on my own, so...

17:54.116 --> 17:57.870
Yeah, it's great. I mean it. Sign the paper.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.956
Really? Really, really?

18:05.043 --> 18:07.963
Well, I pulled a small building
out of a big man,

18:08.046 --> 18:10.674
pissed off a few surgeons,
and turned a boring ass day around.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.634
I say I've earned this souvenir.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.387
Documentation is a large part of
your boring ass day.

18:15.471 --> 18:18.515
And I would love to see more of it.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.059
Okay. So you want to talk
about my paperwork.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.730
It is my hope that you can save lives
and document the process

18:24.813 --> 18:28.567
so that we can remain funded
and continue to do just that.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.444
Now, if you would like to take these...

18:30.527 --> 18:33.822
Okay, okay, I get it. How about this?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.324
Put that shit on my desk.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.663
Started a hep-lock at 5:00 p.m.
Labs still not back yet.

18:41.747 --> 18:46.168
Follow up with home care worker
whose name I totally forgot.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.921
Her name was Melinda.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.047
You look tired.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.966
My whole body is tired,
but 14 people thanked me today.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.510
I can stay late if that helps.

18:54.593 --> 18:55.969
No, it's okay. Get out of here.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.471
Thanks, Dr. Cooper.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.056
Fifteen.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.559
There is a guy
waiting to hear how his wife is.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.813
She's the one who fell down the escalator
on 53rd and Lex.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.065
She's gonna be in a wheelchair
for at least six months.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.734
I know. It is awful.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.110
Can you tell him?

19:13.237 --> 19:14.238
No.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.114
Please?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
I laugh when I get nervous.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.202
I don't mean to be a dick,

19:20.285 --> 19:22.538
but there are 5,000 people
that would kill to have this residency.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.582
Look, being a doctor isn't for everyone.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.252
- Excuse me?
- Did you not hear me or are you pissed?

19:28.794 --> 19:30.671
I'm honestly asking
because I'm having a hard time reading you.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.298
Dude, you're not the only person in the
world that went to medical school.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.385
You need to get out of my face, okay?

19:38.053 --> 19:40.013
- Whoa, okay, hold on.
- I am.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.182
If you can do this, I can do this.

19:42.558 --> 19:43.642
By this you mean...

19:43.725 --> 19:45.227
All Of it.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.480
That's so sweet. Doctors playing doctor.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.441
Let go on the count of three?

19:53.777 --> 19:56.071
One, two, three.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.590
Do you ever go home?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.550
What's up?

20:17.217 --> 20:20.637
I see you've got a deskful,
but we are short on nurses.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.764
There's never a good time to bring this up.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.267
They make the place run more efficiently
and we need more of them.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.351
Hiring freeze.

20:26.435 --> 20:27.686
I know.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.606
Well, if you need more temps,
you hire them and I'll sign off after the fact.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.274
- You Will?
- I Will.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.361
And if we get backed up

20:36.445 --> 20:37.946
and you need to order some tests,

20:38.363 --> 20:40.157
you order them.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.618
Make good decisions and
don't give me any more paperwork, all right?

21:00.010 --> 21:01.553
Hey, I heard.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.848
It was nothing.
You know me, I bounce back hard.

21:04.932 --> 21:08.310
Yeah, I saw Kevin,
so I figured I'd stay in the cave.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.479
You don't have to hide out.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.439
You want something?

21:13.649 --> 21:15.734
No, I'm good.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.195
God, it was a shitty day.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.197
I signed 400 papers,

21:21.073 --> 21:22.324
ended my marriage,

21:22.699 --> 21:24.993
gave him joint custody,

21:25.077 --> 21:28.664
then this cop asks me out
at the worst possible moment.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.334
I don't know.
This shit only happens to me, right?

21:32.417 --> 21:37.130
Yeah, well, my advice, take your time.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.508
Don't rush. Don't drive into anyone else.

21:41.510 --> 21:42.636
What's with the tone?

21:43.178 --> 21:45.430
- No tone.
- No, there's definitely a tone.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.892
I just came in here to talk to my friend.

21:48.976 --> 21:50.268
Okay, got it.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.188
That is what you are, right?

21:53.271 --> 21:54.481
You know what, Jackie?

21:54.564 --> 21:57.609
I would love to sit down with you someday
and sign some document

21:57.693 --> 22:00.237
that would clarify just what the fuck we are.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.240
Hey, Gloria. How can we help you?

22:04.366 --> 22:06.034
I don't know what I came in here for.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.454
Take all the time you need.
I don't know what I came in here for either.

22:09.538 --> 22:11.957
Please, you always know
exactly why you do something.

22:12.416 --> 22:16.044
Don't come in here and pretend like
I don't know who the fuck you are.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.963
Yes! Plastic tubing.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.591
Oh, crap. That's not in here.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.749
Sorry about that. I knew we still had some.
Been running low.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.710
You have any questions about
how to use these?

22:57.002 --> 22:59.713
No, I'm very familiar. I have a bad back.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.923
Great.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.188
Thank you.

23:23.236 --> 23:26.073
Yeah, I thought
dinner was too much pressure.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.949
So I just thought coffee.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.452
You still look very surprised.

23:31.536 --> 23:34.748
Well, I'll be honest with you.
I got pretty good instincts

23:34.831 --> 23:36.333
and I thought I was dead in the water here.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.921
Good instincts, bad handwriting.
You should be a doctor.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.340
You see? I like that.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.092
I like when a compliment
sounds like an insult.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.594
That was my father. My mom was Italian.

23:47.761 --> 23:51.890
She was the one snapping the dish towels
and telling everyone to wipe their feet.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.892
Yeah, my mom was an enforcer.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.310
And a drinker.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.230
You come from a big family?

23:58.313 --> 23:59.564
So you both went to therapy?

23:59.648 --> 24:02.025
Yeah, it helped. We broke up a lot quicker.

24:02.651 --> 24:04.402
And a lot less bullshit, you know?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.696
I still go once a month for maintenance.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.700
I go to the gym once a month, too.

24:10.784 --> 24:11.827
I like the Zumba.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.537
That was a visual I didn't need.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.416
I took a World Cinema Class at NYU at night.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.210
Thought I'd meet people.

24:20.418 --> 24:21.795
And by people I mean women.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.090
Next thing I know, I'm watching this movie
about Brazilian street kids.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.175
You ever see it? <i>Pixote.</i> You ever see it?

24:27.259 --> 24:29.052
Don't. It'll make you want to kill yourself.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.762
Pixote. I'll take that Off my list.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.597
<i>- No Pixote.
- How do you spell Pixote?</i>

24:32.681 --> 24:34.432
This bloody nose won't stop.

24:34.516 --> 24:39.062
So it's getting all over the front of my new
little pretty first-day-of-school dress

24:39.146 --> 24:43.108
and I spent the entire first day
in the nurse's office.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.527
They had to get me an old shirt
from the lost and found.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.321
You know, that story's
almost too pathetic to tell.

24:50.699 --> 24:52.617
- What? That's not really the time.
- What?

24:52.701 --> 24:56.246
God, Kevin's gonna be dropping the kids.
Fuck. I'm gonna be so late.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.707
No, you're not.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.966
So, do you want to do this again?
Because I do.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.220
A couple things you've got to know.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.182
I'm a recovering drug addict.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.351
I work 70 hours a week.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.980
I have two girls.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.900
So it's a date.
