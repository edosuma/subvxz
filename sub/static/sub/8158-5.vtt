SOFT MUSIC PLAYING

00:51.080 --> 00:56.040
You see, to me, Janice, art...

00:56.120 --> 01:01.440
You know, art...
Art must, by its very nature,

01:01.560 --> 01:03.520
be self-indulgent, right?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.840
As I said to David Hockney once,

01:06.920 --> 01:11.840
the inherent element
in all artistic projects
should not be of contemporary mass appeal

01:11.960 --> 01:15.400
but rather one of personal symbolism.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.280
Don't you agree, Janice?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.040
I dunno, Rodney.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.800
Oh, well, you know,
that's why I like talkin' to you.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.640
You're one of the few people
who seems to understand me.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.880
My brother Don paints, you know.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.920
-Really?
-Yeah, for the council.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.160
No, that is cosmic, Janice.
Really, that is cosmic, that.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.360
That's probably why we have
the same appreciation
and understanding of true art.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.320
We have an affinity,
an aesthetic bond.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.560
We are kindred spirits, Janice.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.680
Seekers of beauty in a broken, ugly world.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.280
-Janice?
-Yes, Rodney?

01:56.360 --> 01:58.280
Take your bra off.

01:59.640 --> 02:00.760
I can't.

02:01.240 --> 02:04.080
'Course you can.
You must live and be free.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.000
I can't, Rodney.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.160
I'm not wearing one.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.000
Oh.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.520
Well...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.560
Oh, yeah.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.200
Bit dark in here, innit?

02:24.880 --> 02:28.640
Put him down, Janice,
you don't know where he's been!

02:29.640 --> 02:33.240
Now, what have we here?
I'll have a drop of that. Thanks.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.280
Don't want this rubbish on, do we?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.960
-Janice, mind his bruises.
-What bruises?

02:41.200 --> 02:45.160
Bruises. He's covered in them.
Where girls keep pushing him away
with 10-foot barge poles.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.480
-You're in, are you, Del?
-Yes, Rodders. Hope you've been
behaving yourself?

02:56.560 --> 02:59.280
Remember what I told you,
not to do it on your own doorstep.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.800
We've been discussin' art.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.360
You like art, Del?

03:04.440 --> 03:08.320
Oh, yeah. He was Cultural Adviser
to the Chelsea Shed!

03:08.400 --> 03:12.320
I'm a Renaissance man.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.360
I like pictures where the eyes
follow you round the room.

03:15.480 --> 03:21.520
Last week, down the pie and eel shop,
Del shook the art world

03:21.680 --> 03:25.800
by stating, quite openly,
that Michelangelo
was a wally-brain.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.720
Well, he was a wally-brain!
Took him 12 years to paint one ceiling!

03:31.840 --> 03:34.240
Not like your brother.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.320
He's on bonus.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.720
I do not believe this conversation!

03:40.800 --> 03:45.680
Some of those artists
are a bit sick if you ask me.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.400
RODNEY: What are you on about now?

03:47.480 --> 03:48.920
I mean, take a look at this, Rod.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.360
Now this is a statuette
of the <i>Venus de Milo, </i>right?

03:54.560 --> 03:59.920
Now who, but the sick of mind,
would do a sculpture of a disabled person?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.640
Am I right, Janice?

04:02.760 --> 04:04.680
-It is a bit sick, innit?
-DEL: There you are.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.200
It weren't like that originally!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.800
The product of a twisted mind.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.000
Talking about which,
are you still looking for a job?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.480
In this country?

04:15.560 --> 04:17.840
With 3 million unemployed?
What chance has he got?

04:17.920 --> 04:21.520
His big brother will help him.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.960
Take one of your purple hearts, Rodney.
I have a surprise.

04:25.040 --> 04:29.720
I have got you a position
with a new security company.

04:29.800 --> 04:34.400
They wanted experience,
and as your last job was a milk monitor...

04:35.600 --> 04:40.840
I had some trouble persuading them.
But, I managed to swing it for you.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.280
Are you putting me on, Del?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.840
No! I've got a job for you, Rod.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.800
That's great, Del.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.960
You'll start off as a trainee NSO.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.000
-No!
-Yes, my son.

04:53.080 --> 04:59.200
Use your filbert, keep your nose clean,
an' you could end up as a SENIOR NSO.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.520
I will, Del. I won't let you down.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.480
What's an NSO?

05:03.640 --> 05:04.760
DEL SNIGGERS

05:04.840 --> 05:07.640
Oh, don't be gauche, Janice.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.160
BOTH: "What's an NSO?"

05:09.240 --> 05:12.600
-They don't know they're born,
some of 'em, do they?
-That's right.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.560
Tell her, Del.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.000
An NSO, Janice,
is a Nocturnal Security Officer.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.720
Yeah, a Nocturnal Security Officer...
That sounds like a night-watchman's job.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.880
It's nothing like a night-watchman.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.200
I mean, you will have to work at night.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.000
And will I be "watching"?

05:35.080 --> 05:40.240
No, they won't. No.
Well, no... I mean, you just have to...
You know...

05:42.560 --> 05:44.480
Keep an eye out.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.040
What's the name of this company?

05:48.120 --> 05:49.720
Ah, you wouldn't know them.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.120
Try me. Come on, let's have it.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.600
DEL: All right. It's called...

05:55.680 --> 05:57.160
Trotter Watch.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.240
Trotter Watch? It's you, innit?
I'm working for you, ain't I?

06:02.320 --> 06:07.760
The way I see it, Rodney,
crime is a growth industry.
So, I am striking while the iron is hot.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.560
Nice regular job, good wages...

06:11.640 --> 06:12.640
How good?

06:12.720 --> 06:17.600
We'll talk about that later.
First, let us try on your uniform.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.040
Come on, slip into it.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.240
Oh, the colour suits you.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.640
Yes, look at that fit.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.240
Oh, yes, deja vu...
It's like it's made-to-measure.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.280
Yeah, for someone else.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.440
Ah, well...he'll grow into it.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.840
Let's have a look.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.360
T.W.?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.760
Trotter Watch.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.120
It could also stand for Traffic Warden.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.880
Well, yeah, I suppose it could.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.280
This is a traffic warden's uniform,
isn't it ?

06:50.360 --> 06:52.360
It is not.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.120
You've got me done up
as a bloody traffic warden.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.280
DEL: It is not a traffic warden's uniform.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.240
Trust me, will ya?
Put your cap on.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.680
Well?

07:05.760 --> 07:09.920
I look like a traffic warden!
One that ain't been well!

07:11.400 --> 07:14.360
No, you look stunning, Rodders.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.520
You're emitting authority
all over the place.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.280
I'm not doing it, Del.
I don't want the job.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.600
You can't let me down.
I gave them your word!

07:24.680 --> 07:26.320
To who?

07:26.400 --> 07:29.080
The Tyler Street Bus and Coach Garage.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.560
No, I'm definitely not doing it, Del.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.520
Yeah, okay. 'Course, if you're scared...

07:35.600 --> 07:41.160
Admit it. You're scared.
<i>Allemagne, dix points.</i>

07:41.240 --> 07:43.320
Janice will understand.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.320
Me, scared? You must be joking!

07:48.480 --> 07:54.920
That's the spirit. Now, I want you
down there 9 o'clock tomorrow night sharp.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.440
Now I'm going to bed.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.280
Oh, by the way...
Excuse me, Janice...

08:00.360 --> 08:01.440
Sorry, Janice.

08:01.800 --> 08:07.680
Your bondage rope's in the garage
and Grandad washed yer whip.
It's in the airing cupboard.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.120
Don't think it's shrunk.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.880
So I'll leave you two lovebirds,
and I shall just say Buenos Aires.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.520
Janice!

08:20.600 --> 08:22.200
Janice, he was only...

08:24.400 --> 08:26.600
You rotten git, Del.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.160
DEL: Well, I'll leave it all
in your capable hands, Rodders.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.800
Cheers, Del. You realise this job's
gonna mess up my love-life?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.280
You've got every second Sunday off.

08:43.360 --> 08:48.640
What about Janice?
She could be out with someone else.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.200
Don't worry.
Why d'you think I'm dressed up?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.200
-I'm takin' Janice out.
-You are?

08:58.280 --> 09:02.680
'Course I am. For your sake.
Otherwise she might go out
with somebody else.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.320
Yeah, but...

09:05.680 --> 09:07.400
Yeah.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.440
Cheers, Del.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.120
-But if she's...
-Why the plimsolls?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.600
-What?
-Why are you wearing plimsolls?

09:18.680 --> 09:22.280
They rather mar the symmetry
of the uniform.

09:22.360 --> 09:28.040
I can run faster.
You know, pursue and detain.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.160
No...
Nothing happens round here.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.480
Quiet as a grave.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.840
Well, see you in the morning, Rod.
Take care now.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.440
Yeah. Don't worry about me, Del.
I'll be all right.

Look at that. It's beautiful, innit?
This'll make our fortunes.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.520
Come on, Rodney, it's 8:50.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.000
I used to be a security officer,
before the war.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.440
Blimey, you a security officer?

10:59.520 --> 11:02.720
That's like trusting a piranha fish
with your finger.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.080
Or worse.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.360
It was a big warehouse over Kilburn way.

11:12.440 --> 11:17.480
Stocked everything from furniture
to kiddies' toys.

11:17.640 --> 11:23.280
One fella there
arrived every morning
in a big Wolseley car.

11:23.360 --> 11:30.280
He wore a camel-hair overcoat,
kid gloves, carried a brand-new
leather attache-case,

11:31.760 --> 11:34.720
and smoked expensive cigars.

11:34.800 --> 11:41.000
Well, call it intuition if you like,
but I was suspicious of him.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.720
Why?

11:42.920 --> 11:46.600
Well, he were only a sweeper-up.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.360
Oh, how do you do it, Holmes?

11:52.000 --> 11:58.840
Anyhow, one night as he was leaving,
I stopped him and I searched
his attache-case.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.960
It were empty.

12:01.400 --> 12:06.480
Unperturbed by this minor hiccough
in my investigation,

12:06.880 --> 12:13.360
I stopped him and searched
his attache-case every night
for a whole year! Then he left.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.640
Oh, I wonder why?

12:16.720 --> 12:22.840
I don't remember. I think he claimed
someone was victimising him.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.000
No unions in them days.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.080
No. Well, this is it, eh?

12:29.760 --> 12:35.880
Anyway, a couple of weeks
after he left, the auditors come.
Know what they discovered?

12:36.200 --> 12:40.520
We was missin' 348 attache-cases!

12:42.400 --> 12:46.040
You mean you'd been searching
the stolen gear?

12:46.120 --> 12:49.320
Yeah. And I got done for it.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.080
Fingerprints.

12:52.160 --> 12:57.800
There's a moral to this story, Del Boy,
but for the life of me I can't find it.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.280
I'm not gonna look either.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.240
Hello, the son of the bride of Dracula.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.120
What time is it?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.120
It's nearly 9 o'clock.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.000
I'm gonna be late.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.680
Sit down.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.280
Take it easy. Let me get you
a cup of tea, all right?

13:17.360 --> 13:18.760
Here.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.040
You still takin' my part with Janice?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.680
Yes. I won't let you down.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.600
Cheers. How am I doing?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.720
Very well. Very well.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.480
One more steak meal could crack it.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.760
Yeah? I haven't done this well for ages.

13:34.160 --> 13:39.600
I never found it easy
to get girlfriends either, Rodney.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.160
DEL: I wonder why.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.000
Hey, it's still light out.
It's broad daylight.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.520
It would be, at 9 in the morning.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.560
9 o'clock in the morning?

13:50.640 --> 13:53.920
I've only been in bed 20 minutes!
Why'd you wake me?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.560
Sit down. Don't exaggerate.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.320
Listen...
This is important.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.640
What could be that important?
I haven't got Janice into trouble,
have we?

14:05.720 --> 14:09.760
Don't be silly!
At least, I hope not.

14:09.840 --> 14:16.760
This night security job
of yours is merely a tiny part
of my immaculate scheme.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.720
What scheme?

14:18.800 --> 14:24.800
The tourist trade, Rodney.
Tourists are pouring into London
at the rate of 2,000 a day.

14:25.040 --> 14:31.920
I happen to know the coach-party
trade is falling off.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.880
IMITATING RODNEY
Why is that, Del?

14:33.960 --> 14:39.200
Since you ask, Rodney...
Your average tourist gets fed up

14:39.280 --> 14:44.280
with the Houses of Parliament,
Buck House, the National Gallery...

14:45.240 --> 14:48.400
Once you've seen one Reubens
you've seen them all.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.200
So a dynamic person like me steps in.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.720
Wake up while I'm being dynamic!

14:53.800 --> 14:55.880
-Sorry, go on.
-Right.

14:55.960 --> 15:02.240
There's a new, vibrant, exciting
London waitin' to be discovered.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.840
-Is there?
-'Course there is.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.960
-Ethnic London.
-Ethnic London?

15:09.320 --> 15:13.640
Yes. Romantic places you've only
heard about in fairy tales...

15:13.720 --> 15:15.960
The Lee Valley viaduct,

15:17.680 --> 15:20.960
the glow of Lower Edmonton at dusk,

15:21.040 --> 15:24.920
the excitement of a walkabout
in Croydon.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.360
Look what I've had printed.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.280
I don't believe this.
"Trotters Ethnic Tours."

15:32.280 --> 15:34.760
What's the squiggly stuff and the Chinese?

15:34.840 --> 15:38.080
Arabic.
And the Chinese is Japanese.

15:38.160 --> 15:44.560
90% of all foreign tourists come
from abroad, so we need the lingo.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.560
-We?
<i>-Oui, </i>French! I like it.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.400
You're picking up the lingo.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.000
That's enthusiasm, Rodney.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.280
I meant what do you mean, "we"?

15:56.360 --> 16:03.200
We, us. Well, the family. Grandad'll
be selling the programmes,
I'll be the courier,

16:04.080 --> 16:06.640
and you, Rodney, have the best job.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.880
You will drive the bus.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.480
MIMICS BUS ENGINE

16:10.560 --> 16:13.920
Ding-ding. Hold tight, everybody!

16:14.200 --> 16:15.680
It's another wage, Rodney.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.440
I've got a wage, Del.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.800
You can't live on what I pay you.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.360
How much is that?

16:21.440 --> 16:25.280
Not a lot. I can't afford to.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.560
See, I done a deal.
You see, with the bus garage.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.680
I provide them with a nightwa...
nocturnal security operative,

16:35.720 --> 16:41.480
and they provide me with a bus.
Avoids all that paper-work...

16:41.560 --> 16:44.560
-And income tax.
-Income tax, yeah.

16:46.080 --> 16:51.160
What about it, Rodney?
A lot of effort's gone into
this enterprise.

16:51.320 --> 16:58.280
Grandad was out this morning
distributing these leaflets
to every hotel and boarding-house.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.440
Grandad believes in this scheme.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.040
It's the most stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.720
See?

17:09.200 --> 17:15.560
Del, I can't work all night
and then drive a bus
round ethnic London.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.520
I got to sleep, Del.
My whole body's crying out for it.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.040
Yeah, yeah. Tell you what.

17:23.120 --> 17:29.960
I'll get you some assistance
at the garage...an ex-police dog.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.920
-An ex-police dog?
-Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.120
Now, d'you fancy some breakfast?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.560
I wouldn't say no, Del.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.960
Come on then.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.200
While you're in there,
make me a bacon sandwich.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.720
Where are you gonna get
an ex-police dog from?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.400
I'll get him Nero.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.080
Nero?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.440
Janice's corgi.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.680
DEL SIGHS

18:16.480 --> 18:20.800
We clearly stated on our leaflets
that 9 o'clock was departure time.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.720
Here we are, 11:30, and no sign of 'em.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.760
I told you no-one will turn up.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.760
Yes, they will.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.160
As soon as the word spreads,
they'll be here in droves.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.400
Will this bus be big enough though?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.760
Perhaps two...

18:38.840 --> 18:41.560
A tandem would be too big.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.040
Leave it out, will yer?

18:43.120 --> 18:46.680
I bet you not one single tourist arrives.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.760
I bet you 50 quid.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.440
-Right, 50 quid, you're on.
-Right, then.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.880
-All right.
-Right.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.240
-Right.
-Right.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.880
Shut up, you two, will ya?

18:58.960 --> 19:04.040
I didn't get a wink of sleep
last night, takin' that rotten dog
for walkies and whatnot.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.760
He saw a cat and ran a mile.

19:08.840 --> 19:12.600
Well, cats aren't Nero's strong point.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.040
With burglars, he's a tower of strength.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.640
Where's all these tourists then,
for the ethnic tour round Chingford?

19:22.880 --> 19:25.440
Don't worry. They'll be here.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.480
-Huh!
-Shut up, you.

19:28.560 --> 19:33.400
-How much are you charging
for this tour?
-17 quid each.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.880
Seventeen pounds for
a walkabout in Croydon?

19:36.960 --> 19:40.520
That includes lunch,
traditional British fare...

19:41.400 --> 19:44.120
-Doner kebab.
-Doner kebab?

19:44.200 --> 19:48.640
-For 17 nicker I'd want Donna Summers.
-You're a tightwad.

19:48.960 --> 19:54.640
These tourists don't mind,
providing they get value for money.

19:55.240 --> 19:59.480
They'll snap these souvenirs
of Olde London up.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.200
It's a snip, that is, at a fiver.
Almost alabaster, you know.

20:04.280 --> 20:09.240
This is a Roman statue,
now housed in the Louvre in Paris

20:09.360 --> 20:13.000
as souvenirs of olde London?
It's the <i>Venus</i><i> de Milo,</i> Del.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.360
No, that is Boadicea, that is.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.560
Boadicea rode in a chariot with
swords stickin' out the wheels.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.080
So she fell off her chariot.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.880
It's a rip-off.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.600
<i>Au contraire,</i> Rodney.<i> Au contraire.</i>

20:31.400 --> 20:37.040
I don't wanna leave them potless.
I want them to give us a tip.

20:37.760 --> 20:43.680
As a courier, what do you actually
know about these obscure places
you're dragging 'em to?

20:46.040 --> 20:52.240
Nothing. But don't worry, Rodney.
I'll bluff it. Use the old spiel.

20:52.320 --> 20:58.360
If they ask any dodgy questions,
I'll say I can't understand their English.
Eh?

20:58.440 --> 21:00.600
Don't worry.
It'll be a doddle.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.320
SIGHS

21:03.440 --> 21:09.800
I'll take 'em down to Shoreditch,
show 'em the house
where Sherlock Holmes was born.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.520
Sherlock Holmes was fictional.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.600
Was he? Well, I'll say his house
got blown up in the war.

21:17.240 --> 21:21.160
Tomorrow, I shall take 'em
to the summit of Mount Pleasant.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.640
The summit?

21:23.720 --> 21:26.200
Can't you stand heights?

21:26.280 --> 21:32.240
Mount Pleasant hasn't got a summit.
Just a post office sorting depot.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.360
That's ethnic, innit, eh?

21:36.440 --> 21:40.440
We can show 'em the workers getting
the most from our post.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.080
Rodney...wake up.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.000
They'll be here in their hundreds
in a minute.

21:52.360 --> 21:57.160
DEL: I'll take 'em over to North London,
show 'em where Jack the Ripper
was buried.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.040
RODNEY: Nobody knows where Jack the Ripper
was buried.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.840
DEL: They can't prove me wrong then.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.560
Shall we give up, Del?

22:07.640 --> 22:11.960
Yeah, all right.
You go and begin your nightshift.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.200
Cheers, Del.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.560
DEL: I want you back first thing
in the morning.

22:15.720 --> 22:20.280
And don't forget to take Nero out
so he can do his business.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.400
Pint of lager, Rodney.

22:35.480 --> 22:41.240
They'd sold out of Pina Coladas, Del,
so I got you a Mackeson.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.000
Good thinking.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.840
Thank you, Grandad.

22:47.560 --> 22:54.000
What if people ask about
the history of places...
say the Elephant and Castle?

22:55.200 --> 23:00.440
Well, I'd just say that
Richard the Lionheart,

23:00.520 --> 23:06.200
or <i>Coeur de Lion</i>
as the French called him,
which he did not like...

23:06.280 --> 23:09.760
A little intimate knowledge there, Rod.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.160
Well, his castle was near the roundabout.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.440
The Elephant bit?

23:17.040 --> 23:23.600
I'll say...Hannibal and his elephants
laid siege to the castle.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.920
And Bob's your uncle.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.960
Hannibal crossed the Alps.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.480
On his way to the castle.

23:31.560 --> 23:37.000
I'll say the natives
had never seen an elephant before
and were sorely afraid.

23:37.080 --> 23:42.240
That is how it became
the Elephant and Castle.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.480
If they'd never seen an elephant before,
how would they know one?

23:50.600 --> 23:56.600
For God's sake, Grandad,
an elephant's a bloody elephant.
You can't odds that! I mean...

23:56.680 --> 24:00.960
You can't look at an elephant
and call a place the Cow and Castle.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.960
But you're not telling them the truth,
are you?

24:04.040 --> 24:06.960
Truth! You're so naive, Rodders.

24:08.200 --> 24:12.760
"The truth is relative to what
you can earn from a lie." Einstein.

24:12.840 --> 24:18.920
I'll tell you a truth,
no one's gonna turn up.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.640
They will turn up. They've got to.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.640
This time next year
we'll be millionaires.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.680
You said that this time last year!

24:29.760 --> 24:31.440
You're eating, ain't ya?

24:36.400 --> 24:39.360
I wanted to do this for years, Rodney.

24:39.440 --> 24:44.280
If we could make a go of it,
eventually we'd go legit.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.720
"Trotters Independent Traders"

24:48.800 --> 24:51.360
would be a proper McCoy company.

24:52.760 --> 24:58.200
I have this dream...
You and I own this skyscraper block
on the South Bank.

24:59.680 --> 25:04.880
We're on the balcony
of the penthouse suite
with a couple of sorts,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.360
Gabrielle and Bianca,

25:09.600 --> 25:12.240
bra-less but with class...

25:12.320 --> 25:14.760
Here, do you know your Janice
doesn't wear a bra?

25:14.840 --> 25:16.400
Yeah, I know.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.480
Rubber plants and pine,

25:21.560 --> 25:24.520
sipping red drinks.

25:25.880 --> 25:31.480
On top of the skyscraper,
in 50 foot high neon letters,
are the initials

25:31.560 --> 25:36.280
of Trotters Independent Traders.
Good, eh?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.280
Terrific.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
They've got to come.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.720
It's the way every success starts,
with a great big rip-off.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.320
Grandad's right. No-one's gonna turn up.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.960
Yes, they will. Wait and see.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.720
I think that dream of yours
contains a subliminal message.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.840
Yeah... Eh?

25:58.280 --> 25:59.800
A sort of subconscious truth.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.720
You see this skyscraper belonging to
Trotters Independent Traders, right?

26:04.960 --> 26:05.800
Yeah.

26:05.880 --> 26:09.680
And on the roof
are the company's initials?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.360
Don't you see?

26:13.440 --> 26:19.480
As you're standing on that balcony
with your red drink,
just above your head in neon lights

26:19.560 --> 26:22.360
is the word tit.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.440
Come on, let's call it a day.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.640
You owe me 50 quid on that bet.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.760

about that.

I was gonna be the Freddie Laker
of the highways.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.440
It was a nice try.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.880
But I don't understand it.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.400
Grandad distributed 1000 leaflets.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.520
You'd have thought at least
one punter would've come.

Still, as dear old Mum used to say,
"It's better to know you've lost
than not to know you've won."

28:01.400 --> 28:05.520
Dear old Mum.
She used to say such bloody stupid things.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.880

28:09.840 --> 28:13.360
Thirty, thirty five.
Forty, forty-five, fifty...

28:14.720 --> 28:17.800
Well, that weren't too bad, Rodney.

a nice little drink,
