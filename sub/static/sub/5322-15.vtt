00:00.418 --> 00:02.787
Okay. Fortune cookie time.

00:02.969 --> 00:04.169
Pick one.

00:04.396 --> 00:06.014
This one. No, this one.

00:06.083 --> 00:07.808
- No, this one.
- Okay, how about this one?

00:10.803 --> 00:14.018
"When asked, you will
gladly bend over backwards."

00:14.466 --> 00:15.666
Boring!

00:16.718 --> 00:18.098
Yeah, they're all boring.

00:18.099 --> 00:20.267
That's why you have to add "in bed."

00:22.316 --> 00:25.485
"When asked, you will gladly
bend over backwards..."

00:25.486 --> 00:26.931
Both: In bed!

00:26.932 --> 00:28.307
(Laughing)

00:28.308 --> 00:30.514
- That's good. Okay. Your turn. Your turn.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:30.515 --> 00:32.716
Oh, please tell me I'm going to get a job.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.719
What? Are you kidding me?

00:35.720 --> 00:36.920
I got nothing.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.819
In bed!

00:40.318 --> 00:43.461
No. I... I really don't have
anything. My cookie's empty.

00:43.729 --> 00:45.062
In bed!

00:45.063 --> 00:46.492
(Laughing) I love it!

00:46.493 --> 00:48.602
Gabi, stop. I'm really depressed.

00:48.603 --> 00:50.036
It's obvious I'm never going to get a job

00:50.037 --> 00:52.004
and this cookie doesn't
have the balls to tell me.

00:52.694 --> 00:54.926
Okay. Well, you're never going to get a job

00:54.927 --> 00:56.728
sitting at home reading
fortune cookies. Okay?

00:56.729 --> 00:58.096
You have to take this seriously.

00:58.097 --> 01:00.732
You have to go somewhere that actually
is going to help you find a job.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.667
(Scoffs) And where is that?

01:03.435 --> 01:05.215
The spirits are telling me

01:05.215 --> 01:07.473
that money is coming your way.

01:08.189 --> 01:10.571
Okay. How is this different
from a fortune cookie?

01:11.945 --> 01:14.137
Well, she's not a cookie,

01:14.485 --> 01:16.586
and she is a trained professional.

01:16.587 --> 01:18.163
This is ridiculous.

01:18.823 --> 01:20.996
I see that soon you will be...

01:21.021 --> 01:23.474
asking for a refund "in bed."

01:24.862 --> 01:26.862

01:46.382 --> 01:47.915
I can't believe you brought me here.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.751
Well, where was I supposed to bring you?

01:49.785 --> 01:51.853
Uh... I don't know. A job counselor?

01:51.887 --> 01:53.699
(Scoffing)

01:53.737 --> 01:55.189
A job counselor.

01:55.224 --> 01:56.791
Like that's not a total scam!

01:58.537 --> 02:00.470
I'm sensing tension.

02:00.471 --> 02:03.033
(Gasps) See? She's good.

02:04.399 --> 02:06.800
Okay. Yeah, okay.

02:06.801 --> 02:10.169
Absolute stranger with rudimentary
skills at reading facial cues,

02:10.170 --> 02:11.905
tell me my "future."

02:13.375 --> 02:15.742
Ooh, I'm getting something.

02:15.743 --> 02:18.010
I sense that both of your lives

02:18.011 --> 02:19.436
are about to be shaken up.

02:19.437 --> 02:21.781
- (Gasps) Oh, my God.
- That's super vague.

02:22.849 --> 02:24.250
There's more.

02:24.251 --> 02:26.957
(Softly) There's going to be
a seismic shift in your world.

02:26.958 --> 02:29.218
- (Gasps) Oh, my God.
- You just said the same thing...

02:29.219 --> 02:30.627
(Whispering) But you whispered it.

02:32.626 --> 02:35.160
The tremors are gonna ripple through...

02:35.161 --> 02:37.000
now you're just using different words.

02:37.001 --> 02:38.536
Earthquake, bitch!

02:39.399 --> 02:41.099
There's going to be an earthquake!

02:41.133 --> 02:44.569
See? See what you did. You made her mad
and now there's going to be an earthquake.

02:44.604 --> 02:48.640
Gabi, come on. Anyone can predict
an earthquake. This is San Francisco.

02:48.675 --> 02:51.442
But she didn't say exactly
when it was gonna happen.

02:51.443 --> 02:53.530
It's gonna happen the next time you pee.

02:53.770 --> 02:54.970
Me?

03:02.256 --> 03:06.411
Sofia, could you take the, ah, cake samples
over to the table, please? I can't move.

03:07.428 --> 03:10.326
Gabi, this is not healthy.
Would you just pee already?

03:14.535 --> 03:16.565
The fate of San Francisco

03:16.566 --> 03:18.096
rests on my bladder.

03:20.922 --> 03:22.257
You are being ridiculous.

03:22.258 --> 03:26.055
Oh, I don't think anything about
this situation is ridiculous.

03:31.441 --> 03:34.772
Oh, my God. Our wedding cake has
to be this dark chocolate ganache.

03:34.773 --> 03:36.012
It's my number one choice.

03:36.602 --> 03:37.802
Please don't say "number one."

03:39.841 --> 03:41.223
But I like the peanut butter.

03:41.224 --> 03:42.893
Mmm. Please don't say pee.

03:44.215 --> 03:46.933
Okay, that's enough. Come over
here. I gotta tell you something.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.469
No, no, no, no, no.

03:48.926 --> 03:51.905
Sofia, what, okay? I'm
doing cake tasting... (Gasps)

03:52.139 --> 03:53.841
- (Sneezes)
- Yes!

03:53.842 --> 03:55.042
Oh, no!

03:55.043 --> 03:56.544
Take cover, everybody!

03:57.464 --> 03:59.371
Damn, how bad does she have to go?

03:59.511 --> 04:01.046
Sofia, what's going on?

04:01.047 --> 04:03.415
Gabi thinks that if she pees
there's going to be an...

04:03.421 --> 04:04.755
Earthquake!

04:11.287 --> 04:13.607
Hey! Did you guys feel
that? Is everybody okay?

04:14.590 --> 04:15.890
Did anything break?

04:16.985 --> 04:18.851
Yeah. My diet.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.235
Thank you so much for squeezing us in.

04:27.236 --> 04:30.578
Yes, I am so sorry that I ever
doubted you. Ye have much wisdom.

04:31.141 --> 04:33.102
Can you tell us everything
that's going to happen?

04:33.103 --> 04:34.665
Yeah. Don't leave anything out, okay?

04:34.666 --> 04:36.810
And first off, ah, is it safe to pee again?

04:37.584 --> 04:38.784
(Chiming)

04:38.785 --> 04:40.847
- Aha!
- Ooh, what does that mean?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.878
Mmm. My microwave popcorn is done.

04:43.118 --> 04:46.885
Ooh! Ah! Yes!

04:47.182 --> 04:50.639
You're going to be offered
a big bundle of money...

04:50.640 --> 04:52.051
- (Both gasp)
- ...which will lead to you

04:52.052 --> 04:54.119
having a big chubby bundle of joy

04:54.120 --> 04:55.747
- wrapped in blue.
- (Both gasp)

04:55.748 --> 04:57.454
A bundle of money...
you're going to get a job!

04:57.455 --> 05:00.058
Yeah. And some guy at my new
job is going to knock me up.

05:01.047 --> 05:02.353
Wait. What?

05:03.304 --> 05:06.153
Your instinct will be to say
no to this offer, but don't.

05:06.154 --> 05:07.354
Oh, she won't. Now me.

05:08.070 --> 05:11.582
I see that someone is
going to ask for your hand.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.722
- (Gasps)
- My hand? Like in marriage?

05:13.723 --> 05:14.923
It's unclear.

05:14.924 --> 05:17.924
But something about this
relationship is gonna be smoking hot.

05:17.925 --> 05:20.291
(Gasps) Wow. Who is it? Tell me!

05:20.292 --> 05:21.762
Can you tell me anything? Something?

05:21.763 --> 05:24.772
Well, his name starts with the letter "J."

05:24.773 --> 05:25.973
(Gasps)

05:26.423 --> 05:27.623
"J"?

05:29.063 --> 05:32.332
Whose name starts with the
letter "J"? "J"..."J"...

05:32.333 --> 05:33.534
(Gasps)

05:33.535 --> 05:35.266
Is the second letter "O"?
Is the second letter "O"?!

05:35.267 --> 05:37.037
Bitch, you can't buy a vowel.

05:38.036 --> 05:40.987
This isn't <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>.
Who do I look like, Vanna White?

05:48.888 --> 05:51.369
(Josh wheezing)

05:51.397 --> 05:52.710
Josh, are you okay?

05:53.867 --> 05:56.401
Last time I saw a man struggling
that hard to breathe...

05:56.436 --> 05:57.903
we had to switch positions.

06:02.506 --> 06:03.706
I'm okay.

06:04.343 --> 06:07.479
I just... walked up 27
flights of stairs. I'm okay.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.652
But they fixed the elevator
after the earthquake.

06:10.653 --> 06:11.981
You ever heard of aftershocks?

06:12.951 --> 06:14.632
When I was a kid, there was an earthquake,

06:14.633 --> 06:16.767
I was trapped alone in
this elevator for two hours.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.769
To this day I shudder
whenever I hear light jazz.

06:19.076 --> 06:20.610
Yeah. Me, too.

06:21.538 --> 06:23.039
White people ruin everything.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.623
Oh, damn it. I left my phone down there.

06:28.672 --> 06:31.720
Hey, Yolanda, would you mind...

06:31.721 --> 06:33.352
Ah! Newsflash!

06:33.533 --> 06:36.373
Josh, a black woman going to a rich
white man's car, taking his phone...

06:37.938 --> 06:39.385
Never ends well.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.932
Now, what I want you to do,
is I want you to go out there,

06:43.953 --> 06:46.021
get in that elevator
and show it who's boss.

06:46.055 --> 06:47.289
You're right. I'm being crazy.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.857
- Hell, yeah, you are!
- Josh Kaminski!

06:48.891 --> 06:51.058
- Kick ass, Kaminski!
- I'm not scared of stuff!

06:51.092 --> 06:52.760
Damn straight, you're not.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.521
- (Scoffs) I can take it if I feel like it.
- (Elevator chimes)

06:58.606 --> 07:00.007
But I don't feel like it.

07:06.905 --> 07:09.089
I can't believe Josh is
going to propose to me.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.914
God, what is he thinking? I mean,
we couldn't make dating work...

07:11.915 --> 07:13.608
How are we supposed to make marriage work?

07:13.609 --> 07:15.577
He is out of his mind.

07:15.892 --> 07:17.668
Yeah, well least you're getting a ring...

07:17.669 --> 07:20.097
I'm going to be the unmarried
pregnant best friend.

07:20.168 --> 07:21.806
Ugh, I always thought that'd be you.

07:22.404 --> 07:24.272
I mean, I work for the man.

07:24.273 --> 07:27.008
He's putting me in a very awkward position.

07:27.063 --> 07:29.430
Oh, you want to talk
about awkward position?

07:29.431 --> 07:32.295
Try being in your third trimester
and looking for a date on Tinder.

07:32.296 --> 07:34.231
Okay. Well, we just have
to stick together, okay?

07:34.232 --> 07:37.002
You stay by my side and
don't let Josh propose to me.

07:37.014 --> 07:41.115
Okay. And you stay by my side and don't
let anyone put a baby in lil' so-so.

07:44.911 --> 07:46.402
Hey, guys, what you doing?

07:46.706 --> 07:48.907
Gabi, I know this is unfamiliar to you...

07:48.908 --> 07:50.269
but it's called reading.

07:51.713 --> 07:53.314
It's a pamphlet on fertility.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.781
After that dreadful earthquake...

07:54.816 --> 07:56.416
We realized life is short.

07:56.450 --> 07:58.651
So we started talking about life, and we...

07:58.685 --> 08:01.187
- decided to have a baby!
- (Gasps)

08:01.222 --> 08:03.189
Oh, you wanted to tell them? Go ahead.

08:03.987 --> 08:06.145
We decided to have a baby. Whatever...

08:06.146 --> 08:08.513
- Congratulations!
- Oh, guys, that's amazing!

08:08.514 --> 08:10.839
That's why we're so glad to see you.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.702
Using an anonymous egg
donor is so impersonal.

08:13.703 --> 08:15.380
So we'd rather ask someone we know.

08:15.381 --> 08:17.473
Would you consider being
our egg donor, Sofia?

08:18.653 --> 08:20.140
Oh, do you want to ask her? Go ahead.

08:21.327 --> 08:23.777
Would you consider being... ah, forget it.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.741
Oh, my God!

08:26.742 --> 08:28.379
Wait, you want one of her eggs?

08:28.380 --> 08:30.716
Oh, it's nothing personal, Gabalah.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.948
We just don't want to raise a demon spawn.

08:34.816 --> 08:37.114
We'd give you $20,000 for your egg

08:37.115 --> 08:39.621
and you'd help us get
a little bundle of joy.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.187
- Oh, my God, a bundle of joy!
- Oh, my God!

08:42.188 --> 08:44.764
- A bundle of money!
- (Both) It's happening.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.914
- You don't have to say yes right now...
- Yes.

08:47.915 --> 08:50.670
I knew it. We started too high. I
told you she would've taken eight.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.019
So you'll go with us tomorrow

08:54.020 --> 08:55.950
to a fertility doctor to
see if you're a candidate?

08:55.951 --> 08:58.913
Well, a psychic told
me to say "yes," so yes!

08:59.038 --> 09:01.888
Oy, a psychic! I thought
you said she was smart.

09:03.635 --> 09:06.039
Wait, your prediction came true.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.689
Does that mean that Josh is about to...

09:07.690 --> 09:10.313
(wheezing)

09:10.314 --> 09:12.548
Gabi...! (wheezing)

09:12.549 --> 09:14.016
Gabi, will you...

09:14.017 --> 09:15.899
No, no, no, no! I'm too young.

09:17.529 --> 09:19.035
Please make me a smoothie.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.232
Please make me a smoothie!

09:28.731 --> 09:30.632
I know this might seem
a little scary, Sofia...

09:30.667 --> 09:32.868
but Elliot and I are here
for you every step of the way.

09:32.902 --> 09:34.802
Anything you need, you let us know.

09:34.836 --> 09:36.036
Thanks, guys.

09:36.788 --> 09:38.723
Just think, our own little bundle of...

09:38.724 --> 09:39.924
crap!

09:42.340 --> 09:44.540
Look at all these posters.

09:44.541 --> 09:46.275
Oh, I can't!

09:46.276 --> 09:48.010
If I wasn't gay already...

09:50.006 --> 09:52.106
I wouldn't know the first
thing to do with this.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.001
Yeah, neither do straight guys.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.517
Why is there a Sonicare in here?

09:57.518 --> 10:00.253
Oh! Ah, that's not a toothbrush.
That's an ultrasound wand.

10:00.254 --> 10:01.837
Yeah, the doctors use it
to look inside your, ah...

10:01.838 --> 10:05.222
Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis! Penis!

10:05.445 --> 10:08.912
Wow! It's all vagina all the time in here.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.573
Remember that stuff we said about us

10:12.574 --> 10:14.536
- being there... I'm going to go.
- Yeah, just go.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.154
Have a good meeting, Josh.

10:20.188 --> 10:21.455
Okay. See you.

10:21.489 --> 10:22.857
- All right.
- Bye!

10:30.097 --> 10:31.384
Trying to take the stairs?

10:31.391 --> 10:33.641
Why are these stair doors
locked? It's a fire hazard.

10:33.642 --> 10:36.722
Because we are conquering your
fear right here and right now.

10:36.757 --> 10:37.957
No!

10:38.560 --> 10:39.993
That is a bad idea.

10:40.314 --> 10:41.514
I don't wanna.

10:42.311 --> 10:45.426
Come on, Josh. Don't worry. I
did a little research online.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.069
And they say if you want
to conquer your fear,

10:47.070 --> 10:50.103
all you have to do is associate it
with something that makes you happy.

10:50.228 --> 10:51.794
Like firing you?

10:53.124 --> 10:54.457
Or...

10:55.967 --> 10:57.847
Donuts!

10:58.422 --> 11:01.773
Start eating one of these as soon as
you get on the elevator. Like this.

11:05.328 --> 11:06.595
Damn, that's good.

11:08.485 --> 11:09.722
- Yolanda,
- Um...

11:09.723 --> 11:11.190
the elevator doors didn't even open.

11:11.284 --> 11:13.460
No. But my mouth did.

11:14.388 --> 11:15.588
(Elevator dings)

11:16.743 --> 11:17.943
Josh!

11:17.944 --> 11:19.378
Get in that elevator!

11:19.926 --> 11:21.126
Bye!

11:25.417 --> 11:27.836
Okay. I can do this.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.424
Yeah, okay, Josh.

11:29.425 --> 11:31.425
Honestly, I know what you're about to do

11:31.426 --> 11:33.539
and I am just not ready.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.209
And I can see that you're
really nervous, too.

11:36.210 --> 11:38.879
It's going to be fine!
It's going to be fine!

11:38.880 --> 11:40.655
Well, yeah, of course
it's going to be fine.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.422
I mean, you're smart and you're handsome...

11:42.423 --> 11:44.190
no, no, no, no. Don't do this, okay?

11:44.191 --> 11:45.491
Don't do thi... (Gasps)

11:45.779 --> 11:48.422
- It's a big one! It's a big one!
- What's happening?

11:48.423 --> 11:49.936
- Earthquake!
- (Screaming)

11:50.721 --> 11:53.189
Oh, God, Josh. I will marry you!

11:59.118 --> 12:00.714
Elliot, it's over.

12:00.749 --> 12:02.042
You can let go now.

12:04.178 --> 12:05.912
But you're so strong...

12:05.947 --> 12:07.748
Like a Jewish Channing Tatum.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.461
You just bought yourself five more seconds.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.949
(Gasps)

12:13.950 --> 12:15.150
God!

12:15.151 --> 12:16.368
(Panting)

12:16.369 --> 12:17.639
Hello!

12:18.151 --> 12:20.642
Somebody! Somebody help!

12:21.221 --> 12:24.079
(Man) Sofia Maria Consuela
Rafaela Rodriguez?

12:24.080 --> 12:26.310
That's me! Wait, who is that?

12:26.677 --> 12:27.877
Is that God?

12:30.105 --> 12:32.072
Close. It's Dr. Walker

12:32.073 --> 12:33.974
at the urine sample pass-through.

12:33.975 --> 12:35.608
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

12:35.609 --> 12:37.193
No! I can't get the door open.

12:37.194 --> 12:40.181
Okay, don't worry. I already called
for help. Everything's going to be fine.

12:40.182 --> 12:42.449
(Sighs) That's easy for you
to say. You're out there.

12:43.107 --> 12:46.443
That's true. If I was trapped
in there I'd be freaking out.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.961
Can you just keep talking to me?

12:50.012 --> 12:51.774
I'm scared there's going
to be an aftershock.

12:51.775 --> 12:55.488
Okay. Um, what's your favorite ice cream?

12:55.489 --> 12:56.808
Oh! Uh...

12:56.957 --> 12:59.896
Rocky road, cookie dough, too young to die.

13:00.015 --> 13:02.280
That last one's not a
flavor, it's just how I feel.

13:03.047 --> 13:05.657
Oh, my God. I'm freaking out.
Can you just say something else?

13:05.658 --> 13:10.023
You have the prettiest eyes I've ever
seen through a urine pass-through.

13:10.378 --> 13:14.682
Aw. Well, my eyes are not what I thought
you'd be looking into when I got here.

13:17.176 --> 13:19.176
- (Electricity crackling)
- Are we stuck?

13:20.228 --> 13:21.763
Mm-hmm.

13:21.872 --> 13:23.072
What're we gonna do?

13:24.241 --> 13:27.410
Well, first I'm going to put you down.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.549
'Kay.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.273
Then you're going to explain
why you said you'll marry me.

13:34.959 --> 13:36.159
'Kay.

13:45.012 --> 13:46.338
So...

13:46.883 --> 13:49.348
you know that thing where you think
somebody's going to propose to you...

13:49.350 --> 13:51.156
but you're not ready,
so you're like, "no way!"

13:51.157 --> 13:54.008
And then you think you're going to
die, so you're like, "let's do this!"

13:55.620 --> 14:00.156
Gabi, what reason could you possibly have
to think I was going to propose to you?

14:01.561 --> 14:03.342
- A psychic told me.
- And there it is.

14:04.299 --> 14:06.674
Madame Paulette said, the guy whose
name started with the letter "J"

14:06.675 --> 14:09.836
was going to ask for my hand and that
our relationship would be "smoking hot"!

14:09.837 --> 14:11.037
Well, I mean...

14:12.275 --> 14:14.018
That does sound like me.

14:14.611 --> 14:18.063
All right, look. As reliable of
a source as madame Paulette is...

14:18.064 --> 14:21.344
I can assure you, Gabi, the last thing I'm
going to do right now is propose to you.

14:21.384 --> 14:23.919
Yeah. The "last thing" is a little harsh.

14:24.638 --> 14:26.523
Stupid psychic. It would've been nice

14:26.524 --> 14:28.873
if she was going to tell me we're
going to get stuck in an elevator.

14:28.874 --> 14:30.108
She sucks.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.766
We're good now?

14:32.888 --> 14:34.789
No! We're stuck in an elevator!

14:34.790 --> 14:36.908
Okay, relax. Everything's going to be fine.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.378
Take a deep breath. Breathe.
(Breathing deeply) See!

14:40.380 --> 14:42.314
Lot's of oxygen in here.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.449
Plenty of space to move
around if we want to.

14:46.009 --> 14:47.210
(Squeals)

14:48.392 --> 14:51.528
Or freeze exactly in place.

14:51.606 --> 14:53.274
(Light jazz playing)

14:53.275 --> 14:54.788
I gotta get the hell outta here!

14:54.789 --> 14:56.386
What are you doing?
Wait! What are you doing?

14:56.387 --> 14:58.885
I'm going to go climb up a floor and
open the elevator doors, and get you help!

14:58.886 --> 15:00.620
No, no, no! Please don't go.

15:00.621 --> 15:05.658
Gabi, I have to get out of here
before the sax solo kicks in.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.650
Can I tell you something?

15:12.684 --> 15:16.451
After the first earthquake, I
was thinking "life is short...

15:16.452 --> 15:17.986
Why wait to have a kid?"

15:17.987 --> 15:20.622
But now I'm thinking, "life is short...

15:20.623 --> 15:21.989
Why spend it with a kid?"

15:22.732 --> 15:23.932
Really?

15:23.933 --> 15:26.584
Because when I thought I was going to
die, I wasn't thinking about babies,

15:26.585 --> 15:28.218
I was thinking about you.

15:28.517 --> 15:30.482
We may not have that much time left,

15:30.483 --> 15:33.540
but I know I want to
spend it with only you.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.641
And not here in vagina central.

15:37.232 --> 15:38.953
Aw, my little knish!

15:38.954 --> 15:41.334
Aw! My little sweet and sour dumpling.

15:41.886 --> 15:43.859
Ooh, all of a sudden I'm hungry.

15:44.198 --> 15:45.532
I could go for a nosh.

15:47.143 --> 15:48.873
Oh, what about Sofia?

15:49.002 --> 15:51.141
Oh, yeah! Sofia!

15:52.771 --> 15:55.372
Sofia, you want anything from the deli?

15:55.598 --> 15:57.259
I'm trapped in here!

15:57.301 --> 15:58.709
We'll take that as a no.

15:59.094 --> 16:01.138
We would've made such good parents.

16:01.139 --> 16:02.505
The best.

16:04.436 --> 16:07.653
It's nice of you to consider
donating an egg to help your friends.

16:07.986 --> 16:10.412
Yeah, well, I'm not exactly donating.

16:10.413 --> 16:11.698
I'm kinda doing it for the money.

16:11.699 --> 16:13.172
And 'cause a psychic told me to.

16:13.793 --> 16:16.299
Oh, a psychic. Well, then
for sure you should do this.

16:17.092 --> 16:18.292
You think?

16:18.293 --> 16:20.127
No! It's crazy!

16:20.498 --> 16:21.698
Isn't it?

16:21.699 --> 16:25.095
I mean, at first I thought, "cha-ching,
easy money and it wouldn't even hurt,"

16:25.096 --> 16:26.411
and then it's like, "where'd my egg go?

16:26.412 --> 16:28.748
"What egg? Who cares? I have a
million more. I won't even miss it."

16:29.578 --> 16:33.547
But then, what if in 18 years I get a
knock on the door and it's some kid saying,

16:33.548 --> 16:37.583
"Mama," and then I'm like, "Federico
Jose Pablo Enrique Rodriguez...

16:38.460 --> 16:39.956
What are you doing here?"

16:41.382 --> 16:43.316
Can I give you some advice?

16:43.454 --> 16:46.215
What? Advice from an actual
professional? That'll be a welcome change.

16:47.052 --> 16:49.537
If you're not ready for this, don't do it.

16:49.538 --> 16:50.804
Follow your gut.

16:50.805 --> 16:53.301
My gut is telling me to say no...

16:53.355 --> 16:56.457
But my bank account is telling
me, "take the money, fool."

16:57.823 --> 16:59.991
Hey! I have a prediction for you.

17:00.077 --> 17:01.277
What?

17:01.278 --> 17:05.513
A single, young doctor is going
to ask you out for ice cream...

17:05.515 --> 17:08.790
If that's not too forward and
you're not lactose intolerant?

17:10.127 --> 17:12.855
Uh, I think I'd really like that.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.974
(Thudding)

17:15.976 --> 17:17.544
My God! Oh, my God!

17:18.951 --> 17:20.786
(Gasps) I'm saved!

17:20.819 --> 17:22.921
Uh, I'll see you on the other side.

17:25.536 --> 17:28.242
No matter what occurs, I will find you!

17:29.247 --> 17:30.981
Thank you!

17:33.255 --> 17:34.756
Sofia?

17:34.790 --> 17:37.142
It's me, from the urine pass-through.

17:37.994 --> 17:40.853
- Oh, my God.
- What?

17:41.123 --> 17:43.223
The psychic was right.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.506
It's not a baby at all.

17:44.507 --> 17:47.627
You're the chubby bundle
of joy wrapped in blue.

17:47.835 --> 17:50.102
(Scoffs) I've been called worse.

17:50.751 --> 17:52.808
But I get it if you changed your mind

17:52.809 --> 17:54.968
and don't want to go out for
ice cream. It's totally cool.

17:54.969 --> 17:56.998
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, I don't.

17:58.089 --> 18:01.557
Unless it's, uh, after a romantic dinner.

18:02.475 --> 18:04.699
Dinner <i>and</i> ice cream?

18:04.700 --> 18:07.169
That's the perfect night.
I don't even need you to go!

18:12.789 --> 18:14.056
Gabi!

18:14.277 --> 18:16.195
Is this the right floor? I found a fireman.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.164
Yes, yes, yes! This is the right floor.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.928
Thank God, it's been forever!

18:20.252 --> 18:21.509
It's been eight minutes.

18:29.803 --> 18:32.304
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just get me out of here.

18:32.349 --> 18:33.549
Give me your hand.

18:35.852 --> 18:37.052
I'm sorry, what did you say?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.383
Your hand. Give me your hand.

18:39.530 --> 18:42.040
You're asking me for my hand?

18:42.795 --> 18:44.396
Yeah, so I can pull you out of there.

18:46.095 --> 18:47.617
What's your name?

18:48.449 --> 18:50.464
- Lieutenant Reynolds.
- First name. First name.

18:51.099 --> 18:52.695
- Jason.
- Jason!

18:53.455 --> 18:54.722
With a "J"?

18:57.654 --> 18:59.143
Ma'am, did you hit your head in there?

18:59.144 --> 19:02.733
No, no! I'm fine. Oh, my
God, the psychic was right!

19:02.734 --> 19:04.869
A "J" did ask for my hand.

19:04.950 --> 19:06.717
And she was right about smoking hot!

19:06.800 --> 19:08.033
Thank you.

19:08.034 --> 19:10.650
Well, I meant 'cause you're
a fireman, but hi, I'm Gabi.

19:11.766 --> 19:13.761
Well, I have to see about the
people in the other floors...

19:13.762 --> 19:15.048
but I can check on you later if you want.

19:15.049 --> 19:16.324
Yeah, I want. Ah...

19:16.325 --> 19:18.460
I, ah, work in the
penthouse. Swing by anytime.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.171
All right. Well, I'll see you guys later.

19:20.172 --> 19:21.806
(Laughing loudly) Looking forward to it.

19:24.401 --> 19:26.194
He is so brave.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.569
I shimmied out of the elevator...

19:28.570 --> 19:29.803
climbed up the cable...

19:29.804 --> 19:31.858
pried the doors open above
us with my bare hands...

19:31.859 --> 19:33.260
and I found you help, but yeah...

19:33.261 --> 19:34.528
he's superman.

19:36.279 --> 19:37.479
(Woman screams)

19:37.753 --> 19:39.647
And this is not our floor...

19:45.363 --> 19:47.399
Oh, look, Madame Paulette,

19:47.463 --> 19:50.116
I usually talk to my girl
Scarlet over on Liberty Street...

19:50.492 --> 19:53.888
But both my friends said they
met guys after seeing you.

19:54.242 --> 19:56.577
So I'm hoping you got (whispers) the touch.

19:57.791 --> 20:00.107
I'm sorry, I'm not
picking up any vibrations.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.388
Well, maybe you would if you put
down that super tiny fork with the...

20:04.389 --> 20:06.023
ooh, what kind of bread is that?

20:06.130 --> 20:08.064
Uh-uh! This ain't no buffet, bitch.

20:08.216 --> 20:11.085
Well, then tell me my fortune, bitch.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.522
Ah! See, now I'm getting something.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.333
Ah!

20:19.334 --> 20:22.963
You have already met the man you're
going to spend your life with.

20:22.964 --> 20:25.794
Ooh, I have? (Giggling)
What does he look like?

20:26.145 --> 20:27.645
He's the exotic type.

20:27.668 --> 20:29.900
Ooh! I love exotic!

20:30.197 --> 20:33.119
I see him in a suit and tie.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.787
Oh, he fancy!

20:36.687 --> 20:37.935
Tell me more.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.354
He wears a bow tie...

20:41.024 --> 20:43.460
And his name starts with an "E."

20:43.461 --> 20:45.184
Oh, hell no!
