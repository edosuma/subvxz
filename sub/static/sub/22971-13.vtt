Citizens of Trollmarket,
the Trollhunter is dead.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.522
[TROLLS GASP] Oh, no!

00:27.193 --> 00:28.862
No. I'm not.

Where is Vendel?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.867
Vendel is dead, too.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.786
- What?
- [USURNA] Murdered by the Trollhunter.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.914
- [ALL GASP]
- Vendel never liked him.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.791
Why would he do that?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.961
[USURNA] Vendel was the heart
of Trollmarket.

00:45.044 --> 00:49.048
It is with a heavy heart
that I take up his mantle

00:49.132 --> 00:52.844
and promise to lead Trollmarket
into a new era.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.972
A human has led us astray.

00:56.056 --> 01:00.101
It is time that trolls
lead Trollmarket once more.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.877
[BLINKY] What did you want to show us?

02:08.669 --> 02:11.047
There are only two agents of Gunmar...

02:11.131 --> 02:14.592
the Changeling

02:14.676 --> 02:19.764
- [VENDEL] How do you know this?
- [USURNA] Because I'm the master.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.891
Vendel...!

02:21.975 --> 02:23.977
[USURNA] I'm sorry, Vendel.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.534
[BLINKY] No, Master Jim.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.956
Vendel believed in you. He knew
you'd return to make things right.

we've at least got
the element of surprise.

Taking on Gunmar himself?

Oh, what a day.

for his return.
