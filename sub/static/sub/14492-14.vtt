00:33.000 --> 00:34.760
MR. BEAN: Right. One for me...

00:34.840 --> 00:37.280
and one for Teddy.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.360
Good evening.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.840
If you'd like,
follow me, sir.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.280
This way.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.560
Oh, here we are.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.800
Ha, stay there.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.760
Mmm.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.560
Ta-da!

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
Is this yours?

01:01.920 --> 01:03.480
No?

01:03.560 --> 01:04.880
That's yours.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.600
There we are.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.240
Go on, dig in.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.600
Hmm.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.280
Hmmm...

01:24.360 --> 01:27.320
Uh, Teddy, can I have a chip?

01:27.400 --> 01:28.600
Are you sure?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.840
Oh, you're too kind.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.200
Another one?

01:36.280 --> 01:37.800
Hmm. Go on.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.000
Mmm.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.840
There we go.
A spot of telly.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.360
Come on.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.680
MR. BEAN: God's sake!

01:54.960 --> 01:57.000
It must be here somewhere.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.560
Ah.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.880
No.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.680
Ah.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.240
Polar bears?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.440
Oh, you'd like
to move table, sir?

02:41.520 --> 02:42.600
Here we go.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.520
Here you go. Ah.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.520
Okay?

02:58.760 --> 03:00.800
In you go!

03:18.080 --> 03:19.360
MAN: Hey you!

03:33.160 --> 03:34.680
Aha!

03:34.760 --> 03:36.360
- Right.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.640
Floor six.
Floor six.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.640
- Don't cheat, man.
- Oh, come on.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.280
Come on.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.600
Oh, wrong floor.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.080
Teddy. Teddy.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.600
Are you buying this?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.280
Oh! Oh!

04:36.360 --> 04:37.600
- Ahem.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.520
- It's ours.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.040
Oh.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.240
Eh...

05:04.280 --> 05:05.560
Aha.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.880
Oh.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.800
Oh...?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.480
WOMAN: This will do nicely.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.840
- Gimme!
- Oh!

05:21.920 --> 05:23.800
Ah.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.000
Look like I can sell this.
I can sell that.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.160
I can sell the...

05:29.720 --> 05:31.360
This and this.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.680
Hmm.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.400
Huh? Hmm.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.080
- Hello.
- Morning.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.760
I've got others just like that.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.200
- Ohh! Don't touch that!
- MAN: Yes, it is.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.680
- Yes, it is.
- It's all--

05:54.760 --> 05:56.240
- it's all I've got.
- No, no, no.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.760
No. Let me...

05:57.840 --> 05:59.600
Shh, be quiet.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.080
Ohh!

06:01.160 --> 06:02.520
Not this!

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
Oh.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.560
Oh, all right.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.280
- Teddy.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.760
Ohhh!

06:15.840 --> 06:17.720
Um, tell me...

06:17.800 --> 06:18.880
Teddy!

06:18.960 --> 06:20.680
Teddy! Teddy, come back here.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.360
- Give me the teddy, please.
- A tenner.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.480
MR. BEAN: Give me the teddy.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.920
No, wait.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.120
Give me the ted--

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
Gimme.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.400
All right.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.920
- Thank you.
- Mummy!

06:36.000 --> 06:37.440
Now, Teddy, don't you dare

06:37.520 --> 06:39.120
wander off like that again.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.840
- Take it away, Guv.
- MR. BEAN: Stop! Stop! Stop!

06:44.920 --> 06:47.320
Why didn't you
at least take the sofa?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.160
Excuse me.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.240
- Three.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.000
Uh, three, uh, hundred.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.800
Three hundred!
Three hundred!

06:58.880 --> 07:00.600
Three hundred!

07:11.160 --> 07:12.320
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.120
Gangway. Gangway.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.160
- Oh.
- Hmm.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.640
- Hmm.
- WOMAN: Hmm, nice.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.360
It would go with
the coffee table, George.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.120
- MR. BEAN: Ahhh...
- WOMAN: I like the shape,

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
WOMAN:
Nice with the pictures, too,

07:30.560 --> 07:32.360
- Hello.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.080
Uh, good morning, sir.
Good morning, madam.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.320
- Bean.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.840
- Uh, yes, sir.
- We're very interested in this.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.000
Oh, the sofa. Hmm...

07:41.080 --> 07:42.960
- I think he's surprised.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.680
WOMAN: Is it all right?

07:44.760 --> 07:46.680
This sofa...

07:46.760 --> 07:48.240
smells...

07:49.600 --> 07:51.760
No, no, no, no, no.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.560
Whereas, this here...

07:57.680 --> 07:59.720
Ahem, ahem.
What do you think you're doing?

07:59.800 --> 08:01.960
WOMAN: Excuse me.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.200
It's the cushion I want.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.440
Oh, the cushion.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.720
It's the cushion she wants.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.600
Very nice choice.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.960
Oh!

08:11.640 --> 08:13.560
Oh, Teddy.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.040
Out, or three hundred!

08:21.120 --> 08:22.640
Oh.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.960
- Cash!
- Oh. Cash.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.320
To you, to you, to you.
Round the corner.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.840
Okay.

08:38.920 --> 08:40.400
- There you go.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.600
No.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.320
Oh, hey.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take the sofa away.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.680
What?

08:56.760 --> 08:58.680
Mr. Bean, move it.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.800
Ohh.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.960
Off you go.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.080
What?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.520
What the dickens?!

09:52.600 --> 09:54.360
Oh.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.480
Look at this.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.000
All nice.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.800
Now...

10:02.160 --> 10:04.480
Where's that thing gone now?

10:05.760 --> 10:07.840
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.560
It's still there.
Excuse me.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.040
I was just hoping.
I hope I-- Have you got that--

10:22.120 --> 10:23.160
Have you got that...

10:23.240 --> 10:25.000
Huh

10:25.080 --> 10:26.600
- Oh, no.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.960
Stop! Stop!

10:28.040 --> 10:29.520
Stop! Ohh!

10:29.600 --> 10:32.040
Why did you--

10:32.120 --> 10:33.160
A sale is a sale.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.960
Oh, yes.
All right, stop, stop!

11:00.480 --> 11:01.880
MR. BEAN: Ohh.
