00:02.667 --> 00:04.437
Shirley kissed me.
She still loves me.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.890
I'm seeing someone
who's dying of lung cancer.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.141
I can't keep going.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.294
“Hands” Espenson,

00:09.294 --> 00:11.627
banking and finance genius,
only don't call him “Hands.”

00:11.627 --> 00:14.374
I've been working very hard
to deal with my Asperger's syndrome.

00:14.374 --> 00:16.111
It's called “friends with benefits.”

00:16.111 --> 00:18.766
I have never had
that kind of friend before.

00:18.766 --> 00:21.255
–Alan, Marlene Stanger.
–A pleasure, Ms Stanger.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.076
We're going to make love.

00:23.076 --> 00:24.675
We're going to get this
out of our system,

00:24.675 --> 00:26.411
and then we will move on.

00:26.411 --> 00:27.910
You want to marry me?

God!

00:42.716 --> 00:44.947
Oh, God, please, no!

00:47.757 --> 00:51.275
I'm in control.
Deep breaths.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.383
You're in control.

01:02.245 --> 01:05.521
License and registration, please.

01:09.031 --> 01:13.282
Mr Espenson, you were driving
in the car pool lane.

01:13.282 --> 01:17.578
That lane's reserved for vehicles
with two or more passengers.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.635
Sir, that is not a person
in your passenger seat.

01:21.635 --> 01:24.482
I'm sorry.
I'll pay the ticket.

01:24.482 --> 01:27.877
Okay, I'm also going to have
to impound the doll.

01:27.877 --> 01:30.951
–What?
–I'm afraid that's the law, sir.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.452
You can't have her.

01:37.452 --> 01:39.338
Sir, please get back in the vehicle.

01:39.338 --> 01:42.022
No, you can't take her!
She's done nothing wrong!

01:42.022 --> 01:43.802
It was all me, my fault!

01:43.802 --> 01:47.613
Sir, please get back in the vehicle.

01:48.344 --> 01:49.431
No!

01:49.431 --> 01:52.200
No, no, no!

01:52.200 --> 01:53.990
All right! Take it easy!

01:58.210 --> 01:59.730
All right, hold him.

02:00.395 --> 02:01.757
No!

02:20.927 --> 02:22.571
We're photography buffs.

02:22.571 --> 02:25.560
Yes, and I hate to interrupt your buffing,

02:25.560 --> 02:27.280
but there's an emergency.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.167
Jerry Espenson is in jail.
Last night he tackled a police officer.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.414
What?

02:32.414 --> 02:34.739
He's totally flipped out.

02:39.139 --> 02:42.504
If you like to watch,
I'm okay with that.

02:44.986 --> 02:46.726
All right, Denny.

02:47.108 --> 02:49.217
Um, have you got a sec?

02:49.217 --> 02:51.244
Yeah, sure. What's up?

02:53.066 --> 02:56.845
Uh, well, the good news is
I'm getting married…

02:56.845 --> 02:59.891
to Daniel Post.
–Wow.

02:59.891 --> 03:01.940
Denise…
–Thanks.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.517
–Congratulations.
–Thank you.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.700
–Denise…
–Thank you.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.257
Thank you, Denny.

03:06.984 --> 03:08.424
Denny! Denny!

03:08.747 --> 03:09.945
Denny…

03:10.378 --> 03:12.319
Denny!
–Denny!

03:15.236 --> 03:18.189
The bad news is Daniel got arrested,

03:18.189 --> 03:20.772
and I was hoping that
you could defend him.

03:20.772 --> 03:21.980
What did he do?

03:21.980 --> 03:26.821
Well, it seems he went out
and bought himself, um…

03:28.390 --> 03:30.174
a lung.

04:01.597 --> 04:03.006
It's not that complicated.

04:03.006 --> 04:06.237
I met this guy Tom
at my oncologist's office.

04:06.237 --> 04:08.393
He's got a brainstem tumor.
It's inoperable.

04:08.393 --> 04:11.657
So he had cancer, I had cancer,
and we, we became friends.

04:11.657 --> 04:15.618
As you know, I lost a lung.
Coincidentally, Tom has two.

04:15.618 --> 04:17.956
And even more of a coincidence,
our tissues match.

04:17.956 --> 04:19.031
Gee, what do you know?

04:19.031 --> 04:20.983
Now I'm not gonna need a lung
for a couple years,

04:20.983 --> 04:24.430
but, you know, hey, why put off for tomorrow
what you can transplant today?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.480
And as it turns out, I have all
this extra money lying around,

04:26.480 --> 04:28.435
so I thought I'd help
Tom's daughter with college.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.701
Wow. And these idiot prosecutors
thought you were buying a lung.

04:31.701 --> 04:34.033
By the way, you see the ring?

04:38.635 --> 04:39.967
Holy!

04:41.448 --> 04:42.972
Denise.

04:42.972 --> 04:43.925
Marlene.

04:43.925 --> 04:45.723
–I hear you're getting married.
–I am.

04:45.723 --> 04:47.109
Congratulations.

04:47.109 --> 04:49.816
It must be a relief to have
some financial security.

04:49.816 --> 04:51.389
Does Buzz know?

04:51.389 --> 04:52.913
–Buzz?
–Buzz Lightyear.

04:52.913 --> 04:55.518
Isn't that the nickname for
the Ken Doll with benefits?

04:55.518 --> 04:58.247
Marlene, I'm finding it extremely
difficult not to assault you right now.

04:58.247 --> 05:00.687
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I being too familiar?

05:00.687 --> 05:02.163
I thought we were girlfriends.

05:02.163 --> 05:03.750
I was hoping the relationship
wouldn't change

05:03.750 --> 05:05.844
when I made partner and you didn't,
but I guess it has.

05:05.844 --> 05:06.796
Oh, well.

05:06.796 --> 05:10.542
Brad, did you hear?
Denise is getting married.

05:12.727 --> 05:13.901
Really?

05:13.901 --> 05:15.606
I, I was going to tell you.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.997
Sometimes it's easier to hear it
from a third party.

05:21.647 --> 05:23.685
That could have hit me.

05:30.951 --> 05:33.900
Alan, I know I was wrong
to drive in the car pool lane.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.006
I stand ready to pay the fine,
but they have no right to take that…

05:37.006 --> 05:38.241
Okay, Jerry.

05:38.241 --> 05:41.409
I want you to take
a big, deep breath.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.519
Oh, God. They're probably
violating her as we speak.

05:47.519 --> 05:48.614
By “her” you mean the doll?

05:48.614 --> 05:50.928
Some men do despicable things to them.

05:50.928 --> 05:55.907
Some men get them specifically for…
sexual purposes.

05:55.907 --> 05:57.117
You can't mean that.

05:57.117 --> 05:59.968
The blow-up dolls advertised
with the lifelike genitalia?

05:59.968 --> 06:03.136
Men get them for sexual purposes?

06:03.369 --> 06:05.448
–You're making fun of me.
–No, Jerry.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.693
This doll is a virgin.

06:08.693 --> 06:10.285
Now the police have her.

06:10.285 --> 06:12.973
You've got to get her back!
That officer was groping her!

06:12.973 --> 06:14.937
That's why I had to take action.

06:14.937 --> 06:17.432
Jerry, I will help you,
but you're talking about a doll.

06:17.432 --> 06:18.995
But I can talk to her.

06:18.995 --> 06:22.407
As inanimate as she may be,
I feel safe with her.

06:22.407 --> 06:27.015
I can talk…
about things.

06:27.015 --> 06:28.443
Okay.

06:28.443 --> 06:31.892
But, Jerry, could we perhaps
get another doll?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.565
No!

06:35.194 --> 06:37.651
As much as I know that
she's not real,

06:37.651 --> 06:39.454
she's real to me.

06:39.454 --> 06:41.978
You need to help, Alan.

06:43.890 --> 06:46.049
She's real to me.

06:50.590 --> 06:53.967
I got a second and third opinion,
and they all say it's inoperable.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.917
I've been through
the whole stages of death thing.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.133
I cried, I begged,
I threw stuff.

06:59.133 --> 07:00.549
I made it to acceptance.

07:00.549 --> 07:03.685
And now you seem to have made it
to the final stage, profiteering.

07:03.685 --> 07:06.960
These nonterminals
have no sense of humor.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.570
My daughter, she wants me
to fight the cancer,

07:09.570 --> 07:12.002
but the thing is, if I do
the chemo and the radiation,

07:12.002 --> 07:16.139
the most I may buy is three
or four really nasty months.

07:16.139 --> 07:17.876
I don't want that.

07:17.876 --> 07:20.793
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna plead not guilty

07:20.793 --> 07:23.853
and go with your story that this is
just two friends helping each other out.

07:23.853 --> 07:25.850
–Great.
–Except that's probably not gonna work,

07:25.850 --> 07:29.386
so we'll also need to file a motion
to dismiss on Constitutional grounds.

07:29.386 --> 07:31.723
And then hope that
in the Constitution somewhere

07:31.723 --> 07:35.563
it says it's okay to sell your body
parts to the highest bidder.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.690
All right, you wanna marry some
guy, a criminal no less, that's fine,

07:43.690 --> 07:45.000
but to lie to me?
–Don't yell at me!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.193
I did not lie to you.
–Yes, you did.

07:46.193 --> 07:47.734
Denise, we're sleeping together,
and you're engaged.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.178
–Stop yelling at me!
–Don't you think that I deserve some…

07:49.178 --> 07:50.622
–It just happened.
–Oh, it just happened,

07:50.622 --> 07:52.131
you just happened to get engaged?

07:52.131 --> 07:54.382
–Yeah, you know what? Get out!
–So this is the modern-day woman, huh?

07:54.382 --> 07:56.927
She has her friends with benefits
and collects her marriage
proposals on the side?

07:56.927 --> 07:58.804
–Get out!
–You really have it all, don't you?

07:58.804 --> 08:00.685
Yeah, yeah, I really have it all.

08:00.685 --> 08:05.489
I'm in love with a man who is dying.
Lucky, lucky me.

08:07.366 --> 08:09.636
You son of a bitch.

08:16.971 --> 08:21.497
Why didn't you just tell me
that you were seeing him?

08:21.497 --> 08:24.583
Because he was in Switzerland
getting an experimental treatment,

08:24.583 --> 08:27.983
and I didn't think
he was coming back.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.892
I'm sorry that I love him.

08:33.695 --> 08:37.731
I don't want to love him,

08:37.731 --> 08:40.039
but I do.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.851
I've got to get him help.

08:48.851 --> 08:51.213
My God, if you saw the way
he hugged her.

08:51.213 --> 08:52.962
Is she cute?

08:52.962 --> 08:54.353
Denny, it's a doll.

08:54.353 --> 08:57.612
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you've
never gone to town on a doll.

08:57.612 --> 09:01.435
No, as a matter of fact.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.931
Have you?

09:06.658 --> 09:10.331
Denny… –Well, not just any doll.
I'm, I'm not, uh…

09:10.331 --> 09:13.249
uh, what's the word?
–Peculiar.

09:13.249 --> 09:15.542
But I suppose I've been with…

09:15.542 --> 09:18.326
a special doll.

09:19.536 --> 09:21.852
Would I like her?

09:22.542 --> 09:24.441
Do you want to meet her?

09:25.852 --> 09:26.963
She's in the closet.

09:26.963 --> 09:29.750
–Denny, I've been in that closet.
–Not this closet.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.902
I'm the only one with the key
to this closet.

09:44.754 --> 09:48.939
Alan Shore, meet Shirley Schmidtho.

09:48.939 --> 09:50.941
Oh, my God.

09:50.941 --> 09:53.630
This little ho knows how
to please, let me tell you.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.783
You had this custom-made.

09:55.783 --> 09:58.523
Here's the thing
about rich people, Alan.

09:58.523 --> 10:01.847
We get whatever we want.

10:01.847 --> 10:04.767
Shirley Schmidtho.

10:11.998 --> 10:15.731
All rise.
Judge Clark Brown presiding.

10:15.976 --> 10:18.129
–Oh, dear.
–Problem?

10:18.129 --> 10:19.942
Judge Brown, I'm not his favorite.

10:19.942 --> 10:21.728
Be seated.

10:26.599 --> 10:27.941
Ms Schmidt…

10:27.941 --> 10:34.193
I have before me your motion to dismiss
on Constitutional grounds.

10:34.193 --> 10:35.581
Denied.

10:35.581 --> 10:38.137
You better take this.

10:39.161 --> 10:42.959
Your honor, I would ask that you would
reconsider the defense's motion.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.548
I will not.

10:44.548 --> 10:48.784
He wanted to purchase a lung,
and he wanted to sell a lung.

10:48.784 --> 10:52.276
Horrible, horrible
and shocking!

10:52.276 --> 10:55.380
In the interest of fairness, your honor,
it's imperative that you…

10:55.380 --> 10:57.586
No, I'm ruling on your papers.

10:57.586 --> 11:00.611
The law as it stands is Constitutional,

11:00.611 --> 11:03.172
and my decision stands firm.

11:03.172 --> 11:06.404
I am not one of your
activist judges, Ms Bauer.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.367
I follow the law as it is written,

11:08.367 --> 11:13.858
a practice that makes
neither nansy nor pansy.

11:13.858 --> 11:15.608
We will proceed.

11:15.832 --> 11:18.460
I spoke with a few psychologists.

11:18.460 --> 11:22.336
And while they can appreciate
how a person with Asperger's

11:22.336 --> 11:26.588
might find comfort
in an imaginary soul mate…

11:26.588 --> 11:28.423
You're choosing your words carefully.

11:28.423 --> 11:30.114
Why are you talking this way?

11:30.114 --> 11:33.288
When you talk to me like that,
I do not hear your words.

11:33.288 --> 11:38.200
I only hear the pitter-patter of somebody
tiptoeing lightly around a crazy person.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.267
I know she's not real.
I'm not delusional. I just…

11:42.267 --> 11:46.651
I spent a lot of money on it.
That's all.

11:46.651 --> 11:49.931
Jerry, that isn't truthful.

11:49.931 --> 11:54.904
You may not be having sex with it,
but you've completely individualized it.

11:54.904 --> 11:57.804
You call it “her.”
You treat her as a loved one.

11:57.804 --> 12:02.320
You've just described every man's
relationship with his car.

12:02.798 --> 12:08.712
The psychologists tell me as understandable
as your attraction may be,

12:08.712 --> 12:11.313
it isn't healthy.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.613
Have you ever been with
a real woman, sexually?

12:16.260 --> 12:20.562
I think you know the answer
to that question, Alan.

12:20.562 --> 12:27.914
There was a time years ago
when I had some…

12:27.914 --> 12:30.333
difficulty of a certain stripe.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.674
I was referred to a sex therapist,
a surrogate, in fact.

12:33.674 --> 12:36.084
I'd like you to meet with her.
–That's disgusting!

12:36.084 --> 12:39.969
It is not disgusting.
What's more, she helped me enormously.

12:39.969 --> 12:43.119
I believe she could help you.

12:43.626 --> 12:45.087
For God's sake, Jerry,

12:45.087 --> 12:50.017
you're smart enough to realize your disability
with intimacy is profound here.

12:50.017 --> 12:53.113
You need to get help

12:54.212 --> 12:56.369
I was accepted to Penn this spring.

12:56.369 --> 13:00.322
I knew it was out of our price range,
so I contacted the financial aid office.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.340
Did you qualify for financial assistance?

13:02.340 --> 13:03.836
I didn't need to.

13:03.836 --> 13:06.892
My tuition was paid,
all four years in full.

13:06.892 --> 13:08.348
Who paid your tuition, Megan?

13:08.348 --> 13:11.736
It took some digging, but I eventually
learned that it was Daniel Post.

13:11.736 --> 13:15.613
I asked my father who Daniel Post was
and if he knew anything about it.

13:15.613 --> 13:19.597
He said I should be grateful
and to keep it between us.

13:19.597 --> 13:21.456
Then I found the test.

13:21.456 --> 13:23.690
Commonwealth exhibit A.

13:23.690 --> 13:26.787
–Was this the test you discovered?
–Yes, in my dad's desk.

13:26.787 --> 13:30.102
It's a comparison study
between my father and Mr Post.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.601
They're a perfect match for each other.

13:32.601 --> 13:37.898
Megan, why are you here
testifying against your father?

13:38.194 --> 13:41.111
My mother died when I was 6.

13:41.111 --> 13:46.339
My dad is my whole family.

13:47.004 --> 13:50.452
You have to at least try.

13:51.083 --> 13:56.172
Megan, it's clear that you love
your father very, very much,

13:56.172 --> 14:00.151
and he has a tumor in his brain
that cannot be removed.

14:00.151 --> 14:03.589
And there's no getting
around that, is there?

14:03.589 --> 14:04.475
No.

14:04.475 --> 14:06.976
But there's no real evidence

14:06.976 --> 14:11.321
that Daniel Post paid your tuition
in exchange for one of your father's lungs.

14:11.321 --> 14:15.168
There's no contract between them.
Nothing's signed. No receipt.

14:15.168 --> 14:19.995
There's no real proof of a connection
between the two of them, correct?

14:19.995 --> 14:23.848
So they just got typed
and matched for the hell of it?

14:23.848 --> 14:29.016
Megan, your father still has
both of his lungs.

14:29.016 --> 14:36.057
Isn't it possible that Daniel Post
paid your tuition to be nice?

14:36.263 --> 14:41.865
Because he could,
for the daughter of a friend.

14:56.927 --> 14:59.189
Joanna.
My name is Alan Shore.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.430
I'm not sure if you remember me.
–Yes.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.887
How are you, Alan?

15:03.887 --> 15:09.384
I have a matter of great urgency.
I wonder if I could speak with you.

15:09.384 --> 15:13.230
And I'm just afraid
the more isolated he becomes…

15:13.230 --> 15:17.876
I mean, I would imagine men
who bond with dolls,

15:17.876 --> 15:21.975
some kind of intervention has
to take place here.

15:21.975 --> 15:23.755
Alan, I'm retired.

15:23.755 --> 15:25.245
I've remarried,

15:25.245 --> 15:29.089
and my husband has problems
with his wife being a sexual surrogate.

15:29.089 --> 15:30.229
You've retired?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.441
But I can refer you
to several other therapists.

15:32.441 --> 15:35.131
Without even meeting these women,

15:35.131 --> 15:37.613
I know they simply cannot be you.

15:37.613 --> 15:39.483
Well, I suppose I'm flattered.

15:39.483 --> 15:42.289
I mean to connote despair,
not flattery.

15:42.289 --> 15:48.260
My friend is extremely disenfranchised,
both sexually and emotionally,

15:48.260 --> 15:50.124
and time is running out.
He's in his 40s.

15:50.124 --> 15:52.035
His best friend is a doll.

15:52.035 --> 15:56.418
Could you please come out of
retirement for just one case?

15:56.418 --> 15:58.627
I beg you.

16:02.641 --> 16:04.422
I don't want to be alone with her.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.870
Can't I do this over the computer?

16:06.870 --> 16:09.087
No, Jerry, you have to be
in the same room.

16:09.087 --> 16:12.163
I'm not comfortable.
I don't want to be alone with her.

16:12.163 --> 16:14.969
And don't go rushing off to court
trying to get some kind of order.

16:14.969 --> 16:17.315
You can't make me, Alan!

16:17.315 --> 16:19.781
Would it help if Patty went with you?

16:19.781 --> 16:22.231
That'll just make me look
more like a freak.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.241
No, it won't.

16:23.241 --> 16:24.679
How about we both join you,

16:24.679 --> 16:28.636
Patty and I, just for
the initial consultation?

16:29.544 --> 16:32.516
11:30 sounds perfect.
Thank you, Joanna.

16:32.516 --> 16:35.102
You have no idea how grateful I am.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.525
We'll see you then.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.353
You missed your 10 o'clock.

16:39.353 --> 16:41.107
Um, something came up.

16:41.107 --> 16:45.274
Something was supposed to come up
in the closet at 10 o'clock.

16:45.274 --> 16:50.469
I've got a few minutes now if you'd like
to go somewhere and grab a bite.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.103
I'm leaving for New York.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.411
–Now?
–Friday.

16:54.411 --> 16:56.471
I'm transferring
to the New York office.

16:56.471 --> 16:57.792
What?

16:57.792 --> 17:00.358
Why? –I don't feel I'm doing
my best work here.

17:00.358 --> 17:03.043
I assure you, Marlene, you are.

17:03.043 --> 17:05.153
I'll miss you.

17:05.153 --> 17:07.059
Huh? That's it?

17:07.059 --> 17:08.965
You'll miss me?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.342
Dear…

17:13.513 --> 17:16.493
Mr Post, who is Eugene Volokh?

17:16.692 --> 17:19.138
Eugene is a security guard
at my office building.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.448
Why did you write him
a check for $50,000?

17:22.448 --> 17:25.781
Eugene's son is autistic.
He has to go to a special school.

17:25.781 --> 17:28.915
So you just gave him the money?

17:29.362 --> 17:31.889
So in addition to Katrina relief,

17:31.889 --> 17:35.043
the children's hospital of Boston
and a dozen other charities,

17:35.043 --> 17:39.022
you just give money to people
that you meet?

17:40.390 --> 17:46.276
Have you ever asked any of the people
that you've helped for something in return?

17:46.276 --> 17:49.752
–No.
–Not even say, um…

17:49.752 --> 17:51.359
a body part?

17:51.359 --> 17:52.857
Not a one.

17:52.857 --> 17:55.430
Uh, Mr Post, how did you get
to court this morning?

17:55.430 --> 17:57.569
–Car.
–You drove?

17:57.569 --> 17:59.476
–I was driven.
–You have a car and driver?

17:59.476 --> 18:01.118
Let's just stipulate
I'm a rich guy, right?

18:01.118 --> 18:03.412
Rich guys play by different
rules, don't they?

18:03.412 --> 18:05.546
The same rules,
just I have more toys.

18:05.546 --> 18:07.246
You did hear that
I share mine, right?

18:07.246 --> 18:11.254
I did. You're obviously a generous man
and a lucky one.

18:11.254 --> 18:12.808
Except for the whole cancer thing.

18:12.808 --> 18:15.617
Well, but you got the best treatment
money could buy, right?

18:15.617 --> 18:18.684
And then you got yourself into the most
promising drug trial in this country, right?

18:18.684 --> 18:20.170
Along with about 2,000 other people.

18:20.170 --> 18:24.417
You were sued for manipulating
that study to your benefit.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.238
–Uh, the suit went away.
–Because the plaintiff died,

18:28.238 --> 18:31.888
but not before you tried to buy your way
out of the inconvenience of a trial.

18:31.888 --> 18:33.548
And when the study here
at home didn't work,

18:33.548 --> 18:36.346
you just got yourself into
another one in Switzerland, didn't you?

18:36.346 --> 18:39.010
I mean, a man like you, used to
controlling everything in your world…

18:39.010 --> 18:40.527
–Objection!
–Sustained.

18:40.527 --> 18:42.929
I'm just saying, Mr Post,
you've got deep pockets,

18:42.929 --> 18:45.582
and you're able to use them
to get what you want.

18:45.582 --> 18:49.915
And the one lung that you have left,
it's not gonna last forever, is it?

18:49.915 --> 18:53.524
And every time you have
to stop on the street,
and you feel that tightness in your chest,

18:53.524 --> 18:55.428
it reminds you of how vulnerable
you are, doesn't it?

18:55.428 --> 18:56.557
Objection!

18:56.557 --> 19:00.428
Your honor, this trial shouldn't be
about who offered what to whom.

19:00.428 --> 19:03.898
It should be about whether or not
our government has the right to control

19:03.898 --> 19:07.827
what we can and cannot do
with our own bodies…

19:07.827 --> 19:11.567
What you should be able to do
to save your own life.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.023
–Your honor!
–Disregard her.

19:13.023 --> 19:14.644
Judge Brown doesn't want
to hear about these issues,

19:14.644 --> 19:16.270
because they cut a little
too close to the bone.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.904
You see, I did some research,

19:17.904 --> 19:22.463
and it seems judge Brown
is himself a survivor of colon cancer.

19:22.463 --> 19:24.133
But his is treatable.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.715
He could throw a couple of
radioactive seeds in the back door,

19:26.715 --> 19:29.226
and then you don't have to
face the hard truth

19:29.226 --> 19:34.700
about what you would be
willing to do if you were dying.

19:45.028 --> 19:49.048
You know, Jerry, Alan is
very concerned about you.

19:49.048 --> 19:54.188
He thinks your social isolation
is rather extreme.

19:54.188 --> 19:57.043
But the good news is,

19:57.043 --> 19:58.929
it's not.

19:58.929 --> 20:03.259
Many men your age are living alone
these days without partners.

20:03.259 --> 20:05.628
It's become all too common, in fact,

20:05.628 --> 20:10.083
and I've treated many like you,
who prefer dolls.

20:10.083 --> 20:14.596
Mainly they're motivated
by a desire to avoid rejection,

20:14.596 --> 20:16.684
which, when you think about it,

20:16.684 --> 20:22.396
every man fears rejection
from women on some level.

20:23.694 --> 20:26.133
Thank you.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.624
Do you lie in your bed
next to Patricia?

20:34.624 --> 20:37.641
–I do not have sex with her.
–Oh, I believe you.

20:37.641 --> 20:39.051
I believe you.

20:39.051 --> 20:42.810
Because what you're looking for
isn't sex so much

20:42.810 --> 20:47.696
as intimacy in a relationship.

20:49.734 --> 20:54.984
Jerry, I want to have another session
when you and I just lie together.

20:54.984 --> 20:59.411
No sexual touching.
We just lie next to each other.

20:59.411 --> 21:00.539
Oh, I don't know.

21:00.539 --> 21:05.360
It won't be about sex,
but body awareness…

21:05.360 --> 21:08.922
and relaxation.

21:09.525 --> 21:13.611
–Naked?
–Yes.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.021
I wouldn't want you there for that.

21:21.021 --> 21:22.868
Understood.

21:30.744 --> 21:33.527
That didn't go very well.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.561
No, it didn't.

21:39.970 --> 21:43.315
–Are you okay?
–Mm, fine.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.540
A penny for your thoughts?

21:46.540 --> 21:51.054
My thoughts are not for sale,
unlike the rest of…

21:52.945 --> 21:54.348
Ouch.

21:54.348 --> 21:56.405
Yeah.

21:59.400 --> 22:04.570
My father didn't have a lot to leave
when he died,

22:04.570 --> 22:08.122
but he actually executed
something called an ethical will.

22:08.122 --> 22:11.022
Have you heard of them?
–I've drafted them.

22:11.022 --> 22:16.324
He believed that a person's final legacy
shouldn't be so much about his money

22:16.324 --> 22:22.588
as about his character, his values.

22:23.065 --> 22:27.135
Sometimes I wonder what
Daniel's legacy is going to be.

22:27.135 --> 22:29.825
Why don't you ask him?

22:30.047 --> 22:33.853
He'd say that legacies are for dead people,
and he doesn't want to be dead.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.192
I guess that's the only answer
he can live with.

22:37.192 --> 22:41.192
The question is, can you?

23:04.778 --> 23:07.020
How are you feeling?

23:07.020 --> 23:09.953
Fine, thank you.

23:11.710 --> 23:14.306
Before I get into bed,

23:14.306 --> 23:20.733
I'd like to take off my robe,
and I just want you to look at me.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.931
Do you think you can do that?

23:22.931 --> 23:25.698
I'll try.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.502
Could you look at me, Jerry?

23:44.019 --> 23:50.188
See, there's nothing terribly foreign
about the female body, Jerry.

23:51.019 --> 23:55.652
I'm going to climb in
with you now, okay?

23:57.498 --> 23:59.753
Okay.

24:11.545 --> 24:15.925
–How are you feeling?
–I'm afraid.

24:15.925 --> 24:19.142
Would you like me to hold you?

24:24.092 --> 24:26.226
Okay.

24:44.173 --> 24:45.000
Freeze!

24:45.000 --> 24:47.041
Oh, no, no, no!
You can't be in here!

24:47.041 --> 24:48.229
–No, no, no!
–All right, come on, buddy.

24:48.229 --> 24:49.526
–What are you doing?
–No, no, no!

24:49.526 --> 24:52.980
–You can't just barge in here!
–Cuff her. Let's go.

24:52.980 --> 24:55.325
–Let go of them!
–Just one moment, please!

24:55.325 --> 24:57.232
Oh, my God.
God, no!

25:03.510 --> 25:04.917
I am looking for him.

25:04.917 --> 25:09.348
As soon as I find him, I will
get him down to the station. I…

25:09.348 --> 25:12.301
I hear you, Jerry.

25:13.606 --> 25:15.448
Alan!

25:17.211 --> 25:20.284
Oh, come on!

25:23.102 --> 25:24.182
Alan!

25:27.531 --> 25:29.118
What?

25:33.908 --> 25:38.091
You can't blame Daniel Post
for wanting to live.

25:38.091 --> 25:40.417
What's the harm, he asked?

25:40.417 --> 25:44.059
We have many individual liberties
that are dearly cherished in this country.

25:44.059 --> 25:45.586
Equally cherished is the notion

25:45.586 --> 25:48.603
that our law-making bodies
seek to protect the public good.

25:48.603 --> 25:53.238
As a result, we don't have <i>carte blanche</i>
to do whatever we please with our bodies.

25:53.238 --> 25:56.803
Well, Daniel Post decided
that he was above the law.

25:56.803 --> 26:01.444
He figures he doesn't have to play by
the same rules that apply to you and me.

26:01.444 --> 26:03.885
So where's the harm?

26:03.885 --> 26:07.706
And it's not just a matter of anarchy
or the sanctity of the law.

26:07.706 --> 26:11.074
Hundreds of thousands of people
donate their organs every year

26:11.074 --> 26:12.785
so that others might live,

26:12.785 --> 26:16.086
and they count on the system
of distribution to be fair.

26:16.086 --> 26:19.410
If it's not, those organ donations
could stop

26:19.410 --> 26:23.949
or most certainly decline,
and people die.

26:23.949 --> 26:27.226
And that's a harm
he doesn't care about.

26:27.226 --> 26:32.526
I'm hoping that the 12 of you do.

26:32.526 --> 26:34.678
I have a nephew.
He's in college.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.313
During his semester break,

26:36.313 --> 26:41.339
he offered himself as a subject for
medical research in exchange for money.

26:41.339 --> 26:42.901
This is legal.

26:42.901 --> 26:46.403
The woman who lives down the block
from me had her eggs harvested

26:46.403 --> 26:49.197
so that another woman could have a baby.

26:49.197 --> 26:51.001
She did this in exchange for money.

26:51.001 --> 26:52.472
This is legal.

26:52.472 --> 26:57.094
People can sell their hair,
their blood, their sperm.

26:57.094 --> 26:58.643
Legal.

26:58.643 --> 27:02.424
Our nation already embraces the notion

27:02.424 --> 27:05.571
that we have the right
to sell parts of ourselves,

27:05.571 --> 27:10.806
that we are free to make these
kinds of decisions about our own bodies.

27:10.806 --> 27:14.165
Well, sort of.
Certain parts, we have no rights.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.297
But the truth is,

27:16.297 --> 27:19.284
organ sales are happening anyway.

27:19.284 --> 27:21.276
Would, would you like a kidney?

27:21.276 --> 27:24.951
I can get you one in Brazil
for as low as $3,000,

27:24.951 --> 27:27.035
in the Philippines for $1,800.

27:27.035 --> 27:29.912
I can get you an achilles tendon
in South Korea

27:29.912 --> 27:34.200
for anywhere between
$200 and $1,200 dollars.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.559
Why does this black market exist?

27:36.559 --> 27:42.098
Because our current system of organ
donation is woefully failing us.

27:42.098 --> 27:44.830
Sure, you can put your name on a list,

27:44.830 --> 27:49.359
along with 92,000 people who are
left on the list each year.

27:49.359 --> 27:53.546
In the meantime, anyone who can
circumvent that list is doing so.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.840
Families and friends donate directly.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.541
Police and firefighters
have an informal network

27:59.541 --> 28:03.208
where they donate
their organs to each other.

28:03.208 --> 28:05.486
And, and for a stiff monthly fee,

28:05.486 --> 28:11.035
any patient can subscribe
to a donor-matching web site.

28:11.035 --> 28:15.437
And Daniel Post found Tom Raulston.

28:15.437 --> 28:18.570
The Washington DC circuit court
previously found

28:18.570 --> 28:23.817
we have a Constitutional right
to save ourselves.

28:24.225 --> 28:28.037
That's all Daniel Post
was trying to do.

28:51.026 --> 28:53.178
Jerry, I am so, so sorry.

28:53.178 --> 28:55.569
I feel completely responsible,
and I will make this go away.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.309
–I give you my absolute word.
–What happened?

28:58.309 --> 29:00.739
It seems the awful Mr Ginsberg,

29:00.739 --> 29:04.489
our politically ambitious
zealot of a prosecutor,

29:04.489 --> 29:07.966
has begun a citywide crackdown
on a broad assortment of

29:07.966 --> 29:10.682
what he considers
immoral sexual activity,

29:10.682 --> 29:13.353
and somehow you and Joanna
got caught up in it.

29:13.353 --> 29:16.061
But I promise you, Jerry,
this will not stand.

29:16.061 --> 29:18.180
It's prostitution,
pure and simple.

29:18.180 --> 29:20.490
Not prostitution,
it was treatment.

29:20.490 --> 29:24.206
What's more, they didn't even
engage in any sexual activity.

29:24.206 --> 29:25.352
Because they didn't have time.

29:25.352 --> 29:27.219
You bumptious moron!

29:27.219 --> 29:29.807
Your honor, the depravity
of this society

29:29.807 --> 29:32.829
when it comes to sex
has become epidemic.

29:32.829 --> 29:36.147
Somebody has to be a guardian
of decency and…

29:36.147 --> 29:40.458
This depraved society for which you've
anointed yourself decency guardian

29:40.458 --> 29:43.920
spends billions of dollars
on sexual dysfunction.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.435
You can't turn on a cartoon today

29:46.435 --> 29:49.249
without seeing an ad
for erectile dysfunction.

29:49.249 --> 29:51.777
It's one of the fastest-growing
industries in our country,

29:51.777 --> 29:53.866
better sex through chemicals.

29:53.866 --> 29:55.510
I'm not sure I see your point.

29:55.510 --> 29:59.773
My point is, we're cultivating an obsession
with sexual performance,

29:59.773 --> 30:02.484
and while it's perfectly
acceptable to take a pill,

30:02.484 --> 30:04.695
if you seek behavioral therapy,

30:04.695 --> 30:08.348
well, that just goes against everything
we stand for as a pharmaceutical nation.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.808
Well, this man has Asperger's syndrome.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.273
He has a disability

30:12.273 --> 30:16.002
when it comes to establishing
intimate, social, emotional

30:16.002 --> 30:17.881
and yes, sexual relationships.

30:17.881 --> 30:19.219
He sought treatment,

30:19.219 --> 30:22.983
and this pompous buffoon wants
to make a case out of it

30:22.983 --> 30:25.128
to get some face time with Nancy Grace.

30:25.128 --> 30:28.341
I move for an immediate motion to dismiss.
I move for costs,

30:28.341 --> 30:33.011
and I'd ask your honor to sentence
this idiot to sensitivity training,
preferably for life.

30:33.011 --> 30:37.149
All right, I'm gonna take this
under advisement,

30:37.149 --> 30:38.995
and I will rule quickly.

30:38.995 --> 30:41.029
Adjourned.

30:41.029 --> 30:44.821
I am very, very sorry.

30:46.770 --> 30:49.758
I feel so awful.
I've ended up hurting them both.

30:49.758 --> 30:52.343
It'll probably make the news,
compounding their embarrassment.

30:52.343 --> 30:53.862
Alan, face it.
You screwed up,

30:53.862 --> 30:55.642
so all you can do is apologize,

30:55.642 --> 31:00.462
accept responsibility
and check yourself into rehab.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.525
What?

31:03.525 --> 31:05.878
–She's gone.
–Who?

31:05.878 --> 31:08.490
Marlene. She left…
the firm.

31:08.490 --> 31:11.150
No, no, no, she went
to the New York office.

31:11.150 --> 31:12.800
She'll be back.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.536
–This girl mean something to you?
–Don't be silly.

31:16.971 --> 31:18.503
Denny!

31:18.950 --> 31:21.097
There's a rather monstrous rumor
going around

31:21.097 --> 31:24.102
that you customized a doll
in my likeness,

31:24.102 --> 31:29.447
a doll you were caught
having sex with in a closet.

31:29.447 --> 31:31.443
That was him.

31:31.443 --> 31:34.822
I assure you I'm holding out
for the real thing.

31:34.822 --> 31:38.233
Did you have a doll made
in my likeness, Denny?

31:38.233 --> 31:40.217
Come on, Shirley,
you should be flattered.

31:40.217 --> 31:43.720
To be a sexual prop,
that's every woman's dream.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.840
Isn't it?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.862
What's her name?

31:46.862 --> 31:50.327
Sorry? –I'm told she has a name.
What is it?

31:50.538 --> 31:51.777
Oh, that.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.998
Why that's, uh…

31:53.998 --> 31:57.291
Shirley Schmidtho.

31:59.855 --> 32:01.753
I'd like to meet her.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.679
–Well, I don't think that's a very…
–You will bring me the doll.

32:11.989 --> 32:14.108
–This won't be good.
–No.

32:16.048 --> 32:18.271
It's a fluke that you're both
wearing the same outfit.

32:18.271 --> 32:23.000
I know how you women don't like
to see yourselves.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.044
Denny, can you not appreciate
how this degrades me?

32:28.044 --> 32:33.250
Well, I'm just objectifying you
for pleasure.

32:33.250 --> 32:38.279
You truly can't see
how this might humiliate me?

32:40.939 --> 32:42.791
You're jealous?

32:47.944 --> 32:49.522
Here's my problem.

32:49.522 --> 32:53.133
There's no licensing or regulation
of surrogate partners.

32:53.133 --> 32:54.779
As Mr Ginsberg notes,

32:54.779 --> 32:57.524
I suppose any prostitute
could claim she's a surrogate,

32:57.524 --> 33:02.915
but Ms Miller was at one time
a member of the international
professional surrogate association,

33:02.915 --> 33:07.158
and that is a legitimate
and often effective treatment.

33:07.158 --> 33:08.032
Oh, please.

33:08.032 --> 33:11.534
I'm also mindful of the hypocrisy
Mr Shore alluded to earlier.

33:11.534 --> 33:14.423
Big pharmaceutical spends
billions of dollars

33:14.423 --> 33:17.596
cultivating a national obsession
with sexual performance.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.862
We're okay with pushing pills,
but we condemn behavioral treatment?

33:25.681 --> 33:30.878
The charges against Mr Espenson
and Ms Miller are dismissed.

33:31.430 --> 33:34.483
Mr Ginsberg,
I'm sure if you look hard,

33:34.483 --> 33:37.923
you'll be able to find something
better to do with your time.

33:37.923 --> 33:39.697
Adjourned.

33:39.697 --> 33:41.574
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

33:41.574 --> 33:42.439
Thank you.

33:42.439 --> 33:47.680
You heard what the judge said
about the treatment being very effective.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.796
I hope you'll see Joanna again.

33:50.796 --> 33:54.285
–Can I think about it?
–Of course. –Okay.

33:55.053 --> 33:58.935
Thank you again, Alan.

33:58.935 --> 34:01.317
My friend.

34:04.196 --> 34:06.101
Thank you.

34:18.206 --> 34:20.094
What's wrong?

34:20.487 --> 34:22.092
Sorry?

34:22.092 --> 34:24.225
You're blue.

34:24.225 --> 34:26.088
Me?

34:26.088 --> 34:27.907
I'm not, actually.

34:27.907 --> 34:31.460
We got the desired result here.

34:32.454 --> 34:38.533
I'm still concerned about any embarrassment
I might have caused you or Jerry.

34:38.533 --> 34:40.330
But I wouldn't describe myself as…

34:40.330 --> 34:41.960
Blue?

34:46.699 --> 34:48.946
Yeah.

34:48.946 --> 34:53.203
There was a girl.
She left.

34:53.844 --> 34:58.268
It's not as if we had any kind
of meaningful relationship,

34:58.268 --> 35:01.849
but I suppose when I was with her,
I could be my…

35:01.849 --> 35:04.472
true, unadulterated self,
which is, as you know…

35:04.472 --> 35:07.225
Degenerate.

35:10.187 --> 35:15.907
These past few years,
I've felt this inexplicable compulsion
to be somewhat redeeming,

35:15.907 --> 35:22.014
as if I were some series regular
on a television show.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.674
Something about Marlene
allowed me to be…

35:26.674 --> 35:29.530
Degenerate.

35:33.092 --> 35:37.064
In addition to your treatment of Jerry,

35:37.064 --> 35:42.471
do you think you could maybe
squeeze me in?

35:47.845 --> 35:51.783
How about we measure you
for some trousers?

35:55.528 --> 35:58.184
Defendant will please rise.

36:00.195 --> 36:03.862
Madam foreperson, the jury has
reached a unanimous verdict?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.527
–We have.
–What say you?

36:05.527 --> 36:08.138
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
vs Daniel Post”

36:08.138 --> 36:11.507
“on the charge of violating
the uniform anatomical gift act,”

36:11.507 --> 36:14.170
“we find the defendant,”

36:14.170 --> 36:16.749
“not guilty.”

36:16.749 --> 36:18.393
Wow.

36:29.262 --> 36:32.563
Are you gonna talk to me at all?

36:34.058 --> 36:38.661
Do you still love me?
Because I still love you.

36:39.763 --> 36:41.017
All right, tell you what.

36:41.017 --> 36:45.530
You know that, that new fur coat
in the window of Bergdorf Goodman's?

36:45.530 --> 36:48.233
I'll buy you Bergdorf Goodman's.

36:50.780 --> 36:52.923
Daniel…

36:54.171 --> 36:57.640
I think I fell in love
with most of you.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.881
Well, I can live with that.

36:58.881 --> 37:02.318
It's just the rest of this stuff,
I, um…

37:02.318 --> 37:03.587
I need some time.

37:03.587 --> 37:07.165
Well, you know what?
That, that works out, too, because, uh…

37:07.165 --> 37:11.376
Tom and I are gonna be going
on a little vacation.

37:11.376 --> 37:12.936
For how long?

37:12.936 --> 37:15.930
Five, six weeks.

37:17.054 --> 37:19.548
Uh, where?

37:20.295 --> 37:23.836
Probably best you don't know.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.365
Right.

38:24.658 --> 38:27.846
What do you mean, she's
measuring you for trousers?

38:27.846 --> 38:30.601
Is that some kind of fetish?

38:30.601 --> 38:32.828
Would I like it?

38:34.767 --> 38:40.325
My mother wasn't a particularly
doting woman, Denny.

38:40.325 --> 38:45.652
She never held me much or…

38:46.098 --> 38:51.264
except every Fall before
the school year began, she'd…

38:51.264 --> 38:55.436
prepare my school clothes,
measure me for my pants,

38:55.436 --> 38:59.767
the hems and so forth.

38:59.767 --> 39:07.097
I'd stand there, her hand would be
on my leg, my seam…

39:07.097 --> 39:10.383
You had a thing for your mother.

39:11.494 --> 39:14.549
It wasn't sexual.

39:15.784 --> 39:19.224
Her touch was just…

39:19.935 --> 39:24.005
I guess, loving.

39:24.283 --> 39:28.030
One of the reasons
I buy so many suits, I think.

39:28.030 --> 39:33.368
While the tailors do what they do,

39:33.368 --> 39:36.459
I suppose it reminds me of the times

39:36.459 --> 39:43.178
in my childhood I allowed myself
to feel cared for.

39:44.211 --> 39:48.380
Now Joanna…

39:48.380 --> 39:51.008
the way she would touch me,

39:51.008 --> 39:57.973
running her fingers up the inseam
and around in the back, here and there,

39:57.973 --> 40:02.663
it did become erotic.

40:02.979 --> 40:05.508
Getting measured for pants.

40:05.508 --> 40:09.643
It's not entirely about sex, Denny.

40:09.643 --> 40:16.977
It's about being touched in…

40:16.977 --> 40:23.639
gentle, intimate ways.

40:26.821 --> 40:33.738
I suppose I'm starved for a little
tenderness sometimes.

40:35.907 --> 40:39.219
I'm never taking you fishing again.

40:48.325 --> 40:51.871
Do you ever get lonely, Denny?

40:52.892 --> 40:56.460
What's with all this deep thinking?

40:56.460 --> 41:00.960
It's a simple question.
Do you ever get lonely?

41:02.274 --> 41:04.781
Do you?

41:08.453 --> 41:10.117
No.

41:14.092 --> 41:15.946
You?

41:21.643 --> 41:23.429
No.

41:26.156 --> 41:29.239
I guess we're both lucky that way.
