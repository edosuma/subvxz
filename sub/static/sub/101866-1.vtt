01:16.618 --> 01:18.609
Jj

02:35.364 --> 02:38.026
When I was a kid, in the summer,

02:38.116 --> 02:41.904
I would go up into northern Canada
with my father and two brothers fishing.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.245
The one male bonding thing we did.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.074
And the only extravagance
my rather workaholic,

02:48.168 --> 02:50.750
miserly good,
country-boy father could muster.

02:52.214 --> 02:57.709
We flew by bush plane, small planes
with pontoons, info a wilderness lake

02:57.803 --> 03:01.170
where we would be met by an old trapper
who lived there year-round.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.265
He hadn't been back
to civilization for 20 years,

03:05.352 --> 03:09.766
and communicated with the fish camp
organizers on a shortwave radio.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.684
Once we got to his camp,

03:12.776 --> 03:16.985
a group of small cabins
nestled around his little house,

03:17.072 --> 03:20.860
with the sides stacked head high
with a mountain of dried bones.

03:21.868 --> 03:26.282
Behind, there were teepees
with a small group of cree Indians

03:26.373 --> 03:29.240
who would take us out
on the water and be our guides.

03:30.252 --> 03:35.713
They had names like Tom pitt,
rod rat, Billy deer.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.754
All toothless, passive, and alcoholic.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.720
However, they were not allowed
liquor while they worked.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.265
Although their eyes always were
an angry, bloodshot red,

03:47.352 --> 03:49.343
so maybe they were sneaking drinks.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.971
They were truly
romantic figures gone to seed.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.349
Anyway, the point.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.943
At this camp, there was a group of huskies

03:59.030 --> 04:02.238
that that trapper kept for his dogsled
for work in the winter.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.156
It wasn't until we stopped going

04:04.244 --> 04:06.530
that this guy got rid of them
for a showmobile.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.202
These dogs were sweet,
but wild enough to be scary.

04:12.210 --> 04:16.293
The biggest manhood challenge
for me at six years old

04:16.380 --> 04:18.793
was running from our cabin
to the outhouse,

04:18.884 --> 04:22.502
because the dogs would chase you
and nip at your heels.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.587
While you were in the outhouse,

04:24.681 --> 04:27.172
they would scratch at the door and growl.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.803
Horrific.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.761
And then, when you were through,

04:31.855 --> 04:34.221
you'd race back
to the safety of your cabin

04:34.316 --> 04:37.149
hoping the nips wouldn't turn into bites.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.976
Okay.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.350
Rum it is.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.232
Good.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.401
They're hungry.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.293
Sugar?

09:18.725 --> 09:19.760
Okay.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.893
Hey, can I get another one
of these when you get a chance?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.822
- How often you play?
- Never.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.653
- Why?
- I don't need to.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.246
- But you might win.
- I don't wanna win.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.451
Why?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.163
I don't wanna lose.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.264
- Oh.
- Okay.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.047
- Come on. Yep.
- Here we go.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.302
Ready...

11:30.648 --> 11:32.229
- There you go. There you go.
- Mm.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.644
- Come on.
- Come on.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.226
- Come on...
- Come on, baby.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.777
Come on.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.721
Jj

13:53.583 --> 13:55.119
Shh.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.497
Okay. It's okay.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.696
Good?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.033
Mitchell?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.172
Mitchell?

23:28.157 --> 23:30.694
Jj

24:30.552 --> 24:33.544
Jj

26:05.230 --> 26:07.061
I don't understand...

26:09.234 --> 26:12.192
How you can have anything to do
with someone like her.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.785
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean it cannot be.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.864
But why?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.037
That's the wrong question.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.289
The right question is,

26:30.380 --> 26:34.669
"is this the way of the world?"
And the answer is yes.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.218
What do you know?
You don't live in the world.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.965
You stuck yourself at the end
of the universe in here.

26:43.060 --> 26:48.180
You can't see your selfishness,
arrogance, and above all, your ignorance.

26:48.273 --> 26:52.141
You pretend to be open to all things

26:52.236 --> 26:55.854
but can't see how closed-minded you are.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.984
Do you actually believe
you'll find your soul here?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.077
My soul is within me.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.453
Wrong again, brother.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.957
Your soul is outside of you,
and you must claim it.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.500
I have.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.134
I began a journey that finished here.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.553
There is no beginning.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.256
There is ho end. That's babble.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.342
That's not the language of the soul.

27:27.479 --> 27:32.894
Time will pass,
and you'll continue to be lost.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.860
You sound like my father.

27:36.947 --> 27:40.405
You complain that your father
didn't know you.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.030
He carried you on his back through life,

27:44.121 --> 27:48.956
and all you can do is criticize
some oversights he committed,

27:49.042 --> 27:52.876
while you are guilty
of the biggest crimes.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.748
Really? What crimes were those?

27:57.968 --> 27:59.048
You tell me.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.968
No, instead you'd like to hear it
from my mouth, so you can deny it.

28:06.059 --> 28:10.018
That's the same cowardly game
you played with your father.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.604
I love my father.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.307
You were not a loving son.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.730
You were a burden to him.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.729
And now to me.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.154
Jj

30:28.493 --> 30:29.679
When I had been pondering

30:29.703 --> 30:32.866
many different things
to myself for a long time,

30:33.874 --> 30:38.664
and had for many days been seeking
my own self and what my own good was,

30:38.754 --> 30:40.961
and what evil was to be avoided,

30:41.965 --> 30:46.584
there suddenly spoke to me...
What was jt?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.839
I myself or someone else?

30:48.930 --> 30:51.672
Inside or outside me?

30:52.851 --> 30:57.345
This is the very thing
I would love to know, but don't.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.868
No.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.134
Hup.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.300
Okay! Okay!

31:40.899 --> 31:43.891
Jj

31:49.950 --> 31:51.110
Good dog.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.626
Jj

35:14.154 --> 35:15.735
Whoa!

37:36.629 --> 37:41.248
I just wanted to see the dells.

37:44.971 --> 37:49.806
I just wanted to see the dells.

37:51.770 --> 37:56.104
I just wanted to see the dells.

38:00.570 --> 38:05.655
I just wanted to see the dells.

38:08.411 --> 38:13.701
I just wanted to see the dells.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.788
I just wanted to see the dells.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.221
I'm waiting for the doctor.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.801
I'm waiting for the doctor.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.229
I'm waiting for the doctor.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.650
I'm waiting for the doctor.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.275
I'm waiting for the doctor.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.525
Where is the doctor?

38:51.538 --> 38:53.244
Where is the doctor?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.955
Teach me... how to die.

39:01.464 --> 39:05.252
Teach me... how to die.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.217
Where is the doctor?

39:08.304 --> 39:14.807
Where is the doctor?
Where is the doctor?

39:14.894 --> 39:16.009
Where is the doctor?

39:17.021 --> 39:19.262
Where is the doctor?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.723
The doctor where is...

39:21.818 --> 39:23.558
Where is the doctor?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.186
The doctor...

39:26.281 --> 39:29.239
Where is the doctor?
Where is the doctor?

39:29.325 --> 39:33.534
- Teach me... how to die.
- Where is the doctor?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.279
Where is the doctor?

39:36.374 --> 39:37.989
The doctor...

40:13.995 --> 40:15.531
I'm glad you're here.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.950
Dad?

40:21.586 --> 40:23.497
I just gotta get some gear.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.211
What gear?

40:28.676 --> 40:31.383
I promised you I'd take you fishing.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.304
Just gotta go get the boat
out of the garage,

40:34.390 --> 40:36.255
and hitch it up to the buick,

40:36.351 --> 40:40.469
and head out at the crack of dawn
to old partridge lake.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.181
That'd be a heck of a lot more fun
than sitting around watching TV.

40:46.152 --> 40:50.566
But, dad, don't you remember
what the doctor said?

40:52.158 --> 40:53.364
What did he say?

40:55.244 --> 40:56.484
He said you're dead.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.870
Don't listen to him.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.248
Tell me again, what grade you in?

41:09.509 --> 41:13.172
Ah, never mind. We're going fishing.

41:13.262 --> 41:17.346
We'll get to fremont
before the sun comes up.

41:17.433 --> 41:22.427
I'll lower the alumacraft in the water,
fill it up with gear,

41:23.439 --> 41:28.024
poles... tackle boxes,

41:28.111 --> 41:29.726
life preservers,

41:29.821 --> 41:34.906
an ice chest full of cheese and bologna
sandwiches, potato chips...

41:36.077 --> 41:37.077
Cookies.

41:38.579 --> 41:42.663
A large thermos
of ice cold Hawaiian punch.

41:45.753 --> 41:52.215
And ['ll take the Johnson 20-horse
outboard,

41:52.301 --> 41:54.007
put it in the water,

41:54.095 --> 41:56.711
and pull on the starter cord.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.431
I'll let you drive

42:08.526 --> 42:12.485
till we get to where I think the fish are,

42:12.572 --> 42:15.439
where there's tree stumps and tall reeds

42:15.533 --> 42:17.819
and half submerged rocks.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.697
That's their cover, that's where they are.

42:20.788 --> 42:25.282
I'll hit the kill switch on the motor.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.992
And we'll drift it
so we don't spook the fish.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.666
It's so quiet.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.843
I'll put on my lucky mouse lure.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.920
A lazy lke for you.

42:39.015 --> 42:44.601
And for your brother, a dardevle spoon
with a pork rind skirt.

42:44.687 --> 42:49.272
In the stillness you can hear
the distant calls...

42:50.276 --> 42:51.812
Of the loons.

43:07.085 --> 43:10.043
Sounds like a woman being strangled.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.858
I see a spot.

44:19.949 --> 44:24.409
I cast my plug right there,
right between the Lily pads.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.786
I let it sit...

44:29.584 --> 44:32.417
Then I play the lure. Make it dance.

44:33.421 --> 44:37.289
Make it look like something he wants,
something he's hungry for,

44:37.383 --> 44:38.463
then, bang!

44:40.511 --> 44:43.173
And then you set the hook, reel him in.

50:33.322 --> 50:34.482
Dad...

50:40.746 --> 50:41.746
Scalpel.

51:01.475 --> 51:06.640
Respect the presence of sleep.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.263
That is the first thing.

51:09.358 --> 51:12.896
And keep away
from those who sleep badly...

51:14.196 --> 51:16.983
Or stay awake all night.

51:18.075 --> 51:23.786
Modest is even the thief
in the presence of sleep.

51:23.872 --> 51:27.205
He walks slowly through the night.

51:28.294 --> 51:31.411
Immodest is the night watcher

51:31.505 --> 51:33.712
with carrying his light and horn.

51:37.303 --> 51:40.170
No small art is it to sleep.

51:41.515 --> 51:46.179
That's why we must keep awake all day.

51:47.688 --> 51:51.556
Ten truths have to be found
during the day,

51:51.650 --> 51:54.938
otherwise your soul will be hungry

51:55.029 --> 51:58.442
and search the truth at night.

51:58.532 --> 52:02.741
Ten times we must laugh during the day

52:02.828 --> 52:04.534
and be cheerful.

52:04.622 --> 52:07.409
Otherwise your stomach,
the father of affliction,

52:07.499 --> 52:09.706
will disturb you at night.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.623
Jj

53:50.728 --> 53:52.059
Friend.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.560
How are you?

53:58.861 --> 54:00.226
I'm fine.

54:00.320 --> 54:03.187
Who are you? What are you doing here?

54:03.282 --> 54:05.819
I'm interested in the black arts.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.195
They say you're a great magician.

54:11.415 --> 54:14.657
- Really?
- What can you tell me?

54:14.752 --> 54:16.868
That there is nothing to tell.

54:18.839 --> 54:23.333
I'm not here to steal from you.
I'm here to learn.

54:24.803 --> 54:26.668
I came from a long way.

54:29.933 --> 54:32.049
Why did you come to see me?

54:34.730 --> 54:39.645
Because you have heard that I have once
helped people that were sick or abandoned,

54:39.735 --> 54:42.317
- is that it?
- How did you do it?

54:43.322 --> 54:44.687
With compassion.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.737
Just like that?
I thought it would be more difficult.

54:51.914 --> 54:56.874
Tell me, professor,
what do you make of the black arts?

54:57.961 --> 55:02.295
It's an act of vanity
beneath nature, beneath science.

55:04.635 --> 55:07.593
You've arrived at this through reason.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.300
That is your problem.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.476
Don't criticize me.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.521
You make me laugh.

55:20.526 --> 55:24.690
What is funny about you
is that your reason does not stop you.

55:25.948 --> 55:30.032
The secrets you want to know
are the negative of all knowledge.

55:30.118 --> 55:33.531
Your reason is an obstacle.

55:46.552 --> 55:48.964
It's impossible to live without reason.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.257
What do you want with me now?

56:40.439 --> 56:43.772
Haven't you caused everyone enough pain?

56:43.859 --> 56:45.895
As much as you cost me.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.322
I'm so angry.

56:56.371 --> 56:59.704
I'm so... angry.

57:03.045 --> 57:06.879
- You know I thought about getting a gun.
- To kill me?

57:08.300 --> 57:10.040
But no one would give me one.

57:11.553 --> 57:13.168
You didn't try hard enough.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.213
No one would help me find one.

57:16.308 --> 57:19.721
No, you didn't try hard enough
to understand what I did.

57:21.647 --> 57:24.480
I guess they were afraid
I'd use it on myself.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.519
You wouldn't do that.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.987
Why did you humiliate me?

57:38.413 --> 57:39.949
You didn't take care.

57:41.416 --> 57:45.659
You stopped paying attention,
you made room for bad things to happen.

57:47.589 --> 57:49.625
My therapist says you're selfish.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.957
You need a new therapist.

57:57.808 --> 58:01.642
- You destroyed my life.
- We destroyed our life.

58:03.355 --> 58:05.471
We became coarse with each other.

58:07.943 --> 58:10.480
Guilt isn't something to be shared.

58:12.072 --> 58:15.815
The only thing I'm guilty of
is loving you too much.

58:18.704 --> 58:20.319
Tell that to your son.

58:23.375 --> 58:24.535
Is he here?

58:51.403 --> 58:56.864
You know, the only thing I'm guilty of
is loving you too much.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.235
You know that, right?

59:42.079 --> 59:43.319
Hey.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.470
Jj

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.695
Jj

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:44.750
Clint, you look so tired.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:49.095
I walked all the way home.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:52.845
Yeah, all the way from the school.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.927
Yes, I waited for you.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.103
I would have picked you up.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.226
- No.
- Oh, yes.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:03.185
- No, that's what you always say.
- I would have come.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.488
I wait, and I wait, and I wait,
and you never come.

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:10.908
I come. I would have come.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:11.996
Mm.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.117
Clint...

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.962
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.207
For what?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.219
That I wasn't there at the end.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:34.425
It's all right, you were busy.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.733
You're all...

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.736
Equal in-in attention to the family

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.738
and that's really wonderful,

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.571
'cause you might get one that's lazy

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.372
and doesn't want to get up and go and...

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.826
Well... we could...

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.963
This is... listen, you're gonna age.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:09.840
And then I thought, "oh, that's...
No, we shouldn't do that."

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.386
And right about that time...

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.256
I think that was...

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:53.962
Hey, get off the horse.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.449
Who are you?

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.407
Who am I?

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:47.625
It doesn't matter.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.796
You don't need to know
who I am to talk to me.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:07:00.054
You seem to be a disciple
of the black arts,

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.554
3 student of heretics and non-believers.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:11.267
Don't tell me who I am when you're
struggling to know who you are.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.861
What are you hiding?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:22.698
You are Sincere, well-meaning.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.330
Do you think that makes you a Saint?

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:32.579
I believe in right and wrong,
but I am no Saint.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:40.633
Okay, don't be so hard on yourself or me.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.841
You are not a Saint, so be human.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.471
Enjoy, fuck up...

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:54.685
Shake your ass, dance.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:24.566
Jj

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.207
Jj

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:02.045
Whoa!

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:27.928
Whoa!

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.061
Whoa!

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.892
Jj
