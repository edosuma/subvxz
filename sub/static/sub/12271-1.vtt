WEBVTT

00:01.814 --> 00:03.281
Happiness is hard to find.

00:03.349 --> 00:06.350
We gotta try taking risks,

00:06.418 --> 00:07.979
without worrying
about the consequences.

00:09.293 --> 00:10.797
JENNA:
<i>I know</i>

00:10.865 --> 00:12.466
that I was the one
who kissed you, but...

00:12.500 --> 00:14.539
this isn't working.

00:14.609 --> 00:17.647
Your face is the saddle
Jenna's been giddyupping on?

00:17.714 --> 00:19.315
No, no, no, no, no.
It was only one kiss.

00:19.317 --> 00:21.750
Rah!
I'm taking you to get some help.

00:21.818 --> 00:23.485
Bad dog!
You stay away from me!

00:23.554 --> 00:24.556
Whoa!

00:26.226 --> 00:27.392
Dad?

00:27.460 --> 00:29.361
When your dad had me committed,

00:29.428 --> 00:30.932
I know it crushed him.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.268
He was scared

00:32.336 --> 00:34.002
that you would turn out
the same way.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.838
He was actually
trying to help us.

00:35.906 --> 00:37.375
I've been fighting so hard

00:37.443 --> 00:39.046
to save our friendship,

00:39.114 --> 00:40.634
instead of focusing
on the relationship

00:40.648 --> 00:41.849
that actually mattered:

00:41.917 --> 00:43.085
the one with my father.

00:43.153 --> 00:45.298
I'm not well when I'm with you.

Wilfred?

What the hell's going on?

We don't have time.
Come with me.

What?
Now!

I don't understand.

02:09.887 --> 02:11.188
What's happening?

02:11.256 --> 02:12.656
It'll all be clear in a moment.

What...

02:29.111 --> 02:30.344
what happened?

02:30.412 --> 02:32.013
You don't remember?

02:32.080 --> 02:34.382
We were upstairs

02:34.450 --> 02:37.486
fighting about
you and Jenna kissing.

02:37.554 --> 02:39.422
I shoved you, and you tripped
on a tennis ball

02:39.490 --> 02:40.924
and fell down the stairs.

02:40.992 --> 02:43.459
<i>I</i> fell down the stairs?

02:43.527 --> 02:45.497
(crying):
Oh, Ryan, I was so scared.

02:45.564 --> 02:48.066
Look, I forgive you
for kissing Jenna, okay?

02:48.134 --> 02:49.467
I'm just glad
you're still alive.

02:49.535 --> 02:51.270
Oh, these?

02:51.338 --> 02:53.308
Yeah, I thought you were dead.

02:53.376 --> 02:55.843
I figured you'd want me to
move on as quickly as possible

02:55.911 --> 02:57.714
and have at your flesh.

03:00.052 --> 03:02.051
This isn't how it happened.

03:02.119 --> 03:04.718
My dad fell down the stairs.

03:04.786 --> 03:06.990
What are you talking about?

03:07.058 --> 03:08.358
My dad

03:08.426 --> 03:09.992
tripped on the tennis ball.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.628
He... he's the
one who fell.

03:12.695 --> 03:14.562
He...

03:14.631 --> 03:16.232
he died.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.836
You must've hit your head
pretty hard, Ryan.

03:17.904 --> 03:19.838
I-I saw you fall,

03:19.906 --> 03:21.873
and I'm pretty sure
your dad's still alive.

03:23.776 --> 03:25.175
I went to his funeral.

HENRY:
Ryan?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.661
Ryan?

03:54.003 --> 03:55.970
You're here.

03:56.038 --> 03:58.104
Dad.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.452
Just give me
a chance to explain.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.105
Please don't run
out on me again.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.143
Ryan, I know you don't
believe me about the job,

04:03.210 --> 04:04.811
but these are e-mails
between myself,

04:04.878 --> 04:07.546
Monty Goldsmith, the entire
executive committee,

04:07.614 --> 04:08.847
discussing the decision

04:08.915 --> 04:10.885
to create a new
pro bono division.

04:10.952 --> 04:12.119
I wasn't lying to you, Ryan.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.252
This is real.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.060
Your relationship with
this dog is unhealthy.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.929
And like I've said, if
you don't take this job,

04:23.997 --> 04:26.401
we'll have to consider some
other form of treatment.

04:26.469 --> 04:28.136
But I'm not trying
to manipulate you.

04:28.204 --> 04:29.971
I love you, Ryan.

04:30.038 --> 04:31.879
I only want to help.
Don't listen to him, mate.

04:31.909 --> 04:33.911
He's just trying to get you
back in his clutches.

04:33.979 --> 04:35.945
- I-I know it sounds like I'm
trying to control you. - Come on.

04:36.013 --> 04:37.948
Let's just run away together.
And like I've told you before...

04:38.015 --> 04:39.483
that's partially my fault.
Let's just hit the road. We can be drifters.

04:39.551 --> 04:41.120
Obviously, I have issues of
my own, but I'm working on them.

04:41.188 --> 04:42.720
Grow our hair out, stop bathing
and get a bunch of STDs

04:42.788 --> 04:44.957
and lice.
But that doesn't change the fact that you're

04:45.024 --> 04:46.625
suffering from some sort of mental illness.
I hear Phish are kicking off

04:46.692 --> 04:47.892
their next tour
at an airfield in Vermont.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.126
(imitates electric guitar)
At the office,

04:49.194 --> 04:51.361
you tried to defend
Wilfred, as if he were

04:51.429 --> 04:53.230
a friend of yours,
an actual person...

04:53.298 --> 04:54.766
Stop it!

04:58.570 --> 05:00.035
You're right.

05:00.103 --> 05:01.402
I'm not well.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.135
What?

05:11.647 --> 05:13.650
Go home, Wilfred.

05:15.452 --> 05:17.151
You're choosing

05:17.219 --> 05:19.486
that sneaky bullshitter over me?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.956
I said, go home.

05:38.175 --> 05:40.312
I'm glad we're getting
a second chance.

05:43.548 --> 05:46.611
I won't make the same
mistakes again.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.212
Me, neither.

06:02.018 --> 06:03.269
JENNA:
Ryan.

06:03.389 --> 06:05.590
Just making sure you're still
watching Wilfred on Saturday.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.256
Drew and I have plans
in the afternoon.

06:07.324 --> 06:08.789
WILFRED:
Ryan, I forgive you

06:08.856 --> 06:10.256
for what you said the other day.

06:10.324 --> 06:11.964
Just like I forgave you
for kissing Jenna.

06:12.025 --> 06:13.125
That's two forgives,
if you're counting.

06:13.192 --> 06:14.626
JENNA:
Is something wrong?

06:16.429 --> 06:19.164
Y... actually, I-I think
I may have underestimated

06:19.232 --> 06:22.000
how busy I'm gonna be
at my new job.

06:22.068 --> 06:23.935
I-I don't think I can
look after him anymore.

06:24.003 --> 06:25.470
I'm sorry, Jenna.

06:25.538 --> 06:27.537
Oh. Okay.

06:27.605 --> 06:29.405
I mean, you were
the one who asked for this,

06:29.473 --> 06:31.074
but I guess we can
find someone else.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.376
WILFRED:
Okay, I forgive you

06:32.443 --> 06:33.813
for ignoring that last forgive.

06:33.881 --> 06:35.415
That's three forgives now, Ryan.

06:35.483 --> 06:37.417
That's a lot of forgives.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.851
Now, will you please tell Jenna
you can watch me on Saturday?

06:40.919 --> 06:43.888
I forgive you for walking away
and getting in your car.

06:43.956 --> 06:45.088
Four forgives, Ryan!

06:45.156 --> 06:46.622
Okay, you know what?

06:46.690 --> 06:48.458
(engine starts)
I'm taking back the second one.

06:48.526 --> 06:49.994
Three forgives now.

06:50.062 --> 06:51.261
You're down
to three forgives, Ryan.

06:51.329 --> 06:52.695
Okay, right there.

06:52.763 --> 06:54.296
Right there.

06:54.364 --> 06:55.900
I forgive you for rolling
through that stop sign.

06:55.968 --> 06:57.103
You're back to four, Ryan!

06:57.170 --> 06:58.438
Four forgives!

06:58.506 --> 06:59.707
And you're not stopping!

06:59.775 --> 07:01.309
You're back down to three again!

07:01.377 --> 07:03.145
We can play this game
all day, Ryan!

07:05.250 --> 07:07.617
This is the deposition
of her son, who claims

07:07.685 --> 07:10.286
that she had at least ten
psychotic episodes in her home.

07:10.354 --> 07:12.490
The judge ruled him
incompetent to testify.

07:14.093 --> 07:15.727
Was there an investigation?

07:18.360 --> 07:19.693
<i>Harris v. Thompson.</i>

07:19.761 --> 07:21.595
Counsel is found

07:21.663 --> 07:23.827
to be constitutionally
ineffective...

07:23.895 --> 07:25.261
For failing to call
an investigator

07:25.328 --> 07:26.649
to testify on
behalf of the child.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.433
(phone buzzing)

07:31.501 --> 07:33.933
Need to take it?

07:34.001 --> 07:35.735
No, I...

07:35.802 --> 07:37.034
It's not important.

07:38.335 --> 07:39.668
(knocking)

07:39.736 --> 07:41.839
I was on my way back
from my 11:00

07:41.907 --> 07:43.174
with the Yonikawa Group,

07:43.242 --> 07:45.107
and look who I ran into
in the elevator.

07:45.175 --> 07:46.674
KRISTEN: Sorry I'm late.
The new babysitter showed up,

07:46.741 --> 07:49.541
and surprise, surprise,
she was super fat.

07:49.609 --> 07:50.944
I obviously didn't want
Joffrey bonding

07:51.012 --> 07:52.379
with her and learning
those habits,

07:52.447 --> 07:54.179
so I had to find
another babysitter

07:54.246 --> 07:55.607
at the last minute.
(clears throat)

07:55.647 --> 07:57.313
Well, we better head
to the restaurant.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.847
Uh, I need to be downtown
at 2:00,

07:58.914 --> 08:00.515
and I'll be in court
the rest of the day.

08:00.549 --> 08:01.549
LONNIE:
Actually, before you go,

08:01.616 --> 08:02.697
would you mind looking over

08:02.717 --> 08:03.819
the Fisher contract revisions?

08:03.887 --> 08:05.455
It'll only take a second.

08:05.522 --> 08:07.402
Genevieve, please print out
the Fisher contract.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.591
KRISTEN:
Wow.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.993
Look at you in that suit.

08:13.061 --> 08:14.329
You look so handsome.

08:14.396 --> 08:15.697
I'm really glad

08:15.764 --> 08:16.963
you and Dad

08:17.030 --> 08:18.330
finally figured out your issues.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.606
It's like the relationship
we were always supposed to have.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.242
Shit.

08:25.310 --> 08:27.202
I'm gonna call
and move that reservation.

08:51.873 --> 08:53.475
(sighs)

08:54.843 --> 08:57.176
(phone buzzing)

08:57.244 --> 08:58.677
Stop calling me.

08:58.744 --> 09:00.310
I thought I made it pretty clear

09:00.378 --> 09:01.778
that I didn't want to talk
to you anymore.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.646
Ryan, I found something.
An envelope.

09:03.714 --> 09:04.646
An envelope?

09:04.714 --> 09:06.314
No. An envelope.

09:06.382 --> 09:08.142
I've just sent it through;
check your e-mail.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.652
You sent this from my account?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.219
I wish you'd stop using
my e-mail.

09:16.555 --> 09:17.820
(beeps)

09:17.888 --> 09:18.953
Where did this come from?

09:19.021 --> 09:20.120
I posted a photo of the symbol

09:20.187 --> 09:22.923
on Reddit, asking what it meant.

09:22.991 --> 09:24.325
This is what I got back.

09:24.393 --> 09:25.894
No idea who sent it.

09:32.734 --> 09:33.870
I'm not interested.

09:33.937 --> 09:35.139
Are you kidding?

09:35.207 --> 09:36.940
Ryan, we've spent so much time

09:37.007 --> 09:39.040
trying to figure out
what's going on here,

09:39.108 --> 09:41.144
why you see me,
what the symbol means.

09:41.211 --> 09:44.317
This is our chance
to finally get some answers.

09:44.385 --> 09:46.351
I know you don't want anything
to do with me right now,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.354
but come on, this is bigger
than all of that.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.323
(sighs)

09:50.391 --> 09:52.059
I promise I won't get
in your way.

09:52.127 --> 09:53.360
I won't bug you.

09:53.428 --> 09:55.229
Hell, I won't say a word.

09:55.297 --> 09:57.032
(sighs)

09:57.100 --> 09:58.902
It'll be like
I'm not even there.

09:58.969 --> 10:00.536
(whooping) Yeah!

10:00.604 --> 10:01.937
(camera clicks)

10:02.005 --> 10:03.773
Oh-ho, yeah!

10:03.841 --> 10:06.378
The boys are back, baby!

10:06.446 --> 10:08.014
Hold on.

10:08.081 --> 10:10.516
I just want to e-mail this out
so Bear can see

10:10.584 --> 10:11.752
I got my old sidekick back.

10:11.822 --> 10:13.324
Stoke the fires of jealousy.

10:13.391 --> 10:15.160
I told you, this
isn't a reunion.

10:15.228 --> 10:17.261
God, I hate lying to my dad.

10:17.329 --> 10:19.598
We're supposed to
be past all that.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.235
Weird.

10:21.303 --> 10:23.203
There's only five
chicken nuggets in here.

10:23.271 --> 10:25.237
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

10:25.305 --> 10:26.706
I lied to Jenna today, too.

10:26.774 --> 10:28.309
You didn't lie.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.145
You just left.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.093
Yeah, but she thinks
I'm over at Bandit's house,

10:32.147 --> 10:33.780
but here's the thing.

10:33.849 --> 10:37.254
Bandit's owner thinks
he's over at my house.

10:37.321 --> 10:39.691
Listen, this better
not be bullshit.

10:39.759 --> 10:41.392
I'm not bullshitting you, Ryan.

10:41.459 --> 10:43.261
The invitation I got
was very real.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.166
What's up?

10:51.206 --> 10:53.609
When I was passed out at
the bottom of the stairs,

10:53.676 --> 10:56.510
I dreamt that I was cleaning
out my dad's office,

10:56.578 --> 10:58.178
and I found an envelope.

10:58.246 --> 10:59.547
An envelope?

10:59.614 --> 11:01.083
An envelope with a symbol on it.

11:01.151 --> 11:03.687
Whoa. What happened next?

11:03.755 --> 11:05.387
I went to the return address,

11:05.455 --> 11:08.124
and there was this
old statue of you.

11:08.192 --> 11:10.092
Or some sort of dog person.

11:10.159 --> 11:12.926
And then I-I thought
I saw you in the woods,

11:12.994 --> 11:16.566
but it turned out to be
three evil versions of you.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.001
Ryan, you dreamt
about the envelope,

11:19.069 --> 11:20.871
and then it came true.

11:20.939 --> 11:22.240
Don't you see what this means?

11:22.308 --> 11:25.276
It means you're
the magical bean.

11:25.344 --> 11:26.378
(exhales)

11:26.445 --> 11:28.080
This explains everything.

11:28.147 --> 11:30.749
The way I can see and talk
to you like you're a person,

11:30.817 --> 11:32.697
whilst everybody else
just sees you as a carrot.

11:32.753 --> 11:34.023
Forget it.

11:34.090 --> 11:35.292
It also means

11:35.360 --> 11:36.961
your dreams weren't just dreams.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.829
They were premonitions,

11:38.896 --> 11:40.830
and one by one,

11:40.898 --> 11:42.566
just like the envelope,

11:42.633 --> 11:44.671
they'll all come true.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.474
I hope not.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.676
Why not?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.348
Because one of my premonitions
was seeing my dad die.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.951
And my last premonition
was you betraying me.

12:03.529 --> 12:06.199
Does it look anything like the
place you went to in your dream?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.167
Not at all.

12:08.235 --> 12:10.769
The envelope just must've been
a crazy coincidence.

12:10.837 --> 12:13.704
Oh, yeah? Is it a coincidence
that there's a statue

12:13.771 --> 12:15.671
of a dog-faced humanoid
creature over there?

12:15.739 --> 12:17.741
That's a statue
of the Virgin Mary.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.043
Exactly.

12:19.111 --> 12:20.211
And you wonder why Joseph

12:20.279 --> 12:21.479
would never admit he hit that.

12:21.513 --> 12:23.178
It's after 2:00,

12:23.246 --> 12:25.012
and there's nobody here but...

12:25.080 --> 12:26.714
Oh, God.

12:26.782 --> 12:28.015
I'm an idiot.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.683
I can't believe I fell for it.

12:29.751 --> 12:31.217
Fell for what?
Where are you going?

12:31.285 --> 12:32.752
You created that
fake Reddit post

12:32.819 --> 12:34.299
to trick me into
hanging out with you.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.187
No, I didn't. I swear!

12:36.255 --> 12:38.088
Get in the car, Wilfred.
No!

12:38.156 --> 12:39.422
I'm not leaving yet.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.723
I think we should stay
and explore.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.158
Get in the goddamn car.

12:43.527 --> 12:44.561
Wilfred!

12:44.628 --> 12:46.330
Goddamn it!

12:46.397 --> 12:49.396
You don't get back here,
I'm going.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.732
I'm not taking
this shit anymore.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.633
Wilfred, I see you.

12:53.701 --> 12:54.734
Let's go.

12:56.705 --> 12:58.540
I'm right here, mate.

13:12.653 --> 13:14.513
CHILDREN:
Welcome. You have come here

13:14.633 --> 13:15.744
seeking answers.

13:15.864 --> 13:18.467
Now the darkness
will turn to light.

13:18.535 --> 13:20.934
Finally, the mysteries
that haunted you...

13:21.002 --> 13:22.501
Oh, dude!

13:22.569 --> 13:24.170
Who ripped ass?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.071
Come on, I beefed back there,

13:26.139 --> 13:27.607
like, five minutes ago.

13:27.675 --> 13:28.943
You probably dragged it
in your suit.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.543
Oh, God, it reeks.

13:30.611 --> 13:32.011
You messed everything up.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.446
It's a fart. Grow up.

13:33.514 --> 13:35.016
It doesn't even smell that bad.

13:35.084 --> 13:36.352
Yeah, it does.
RYAN: Okay,

13:36.419 --> 13:38.453
is this a joke or something?

13:38.520 --> 13:40.287
Why did you invite us here?

13:40.354 --> 13:41.421
"Us"?

13:41.489 --> 13:44.257
Me. Why did you invite me here?

13:44.325 --> 13:47.327
And why are you wearing
dog suits?

13:47.395 --> 13:49.396
Well, you were asking
questions about that symbol,

13:49.463 --> 13:50.996
and we thought that you
wanted to participate

13:51.064 --> 13:52.429
in the visitation ritual.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.262
The visitation ritual?

13:54.330 --> 13:55.698
What is that?

13:55.766 --> 13:57.300
It has something to do
with the cult

13:57.367 --> 13:59.333
Derek's grandpa was in
back in the early '80s.

13:59.401 --> 14:01.234
It was called the,
um, the Flock of...

14:01.302 --> 14:03.203
The Flock of the Gray Shepherd.
Yeah.

14:03.271 --> 14:05.374
Uh, my grandpa died last year,

14:05.442 --> 14:07.841
but he used to draw that symbol
and tell us stories

14:07.908 --> 14:10.110
about how he
and the other people in his cult

14:10.178 --> 14:13.746
would dress up in dog costumes
and perform messed-up rituals.

14:13.813 --> 14:15.812
We found some of
his old costumes,

14:15.880 --> 14:17.481
and we've been coming out
here every couple of months

14:17.548 --> 14:19.316
and dressing up and stuff.

14:19.383 --> 14:21.218
Wait, you guys
are wearing clothes?

14:21.286 --> 14:23.206
I thought you said we had
to be naked underneath.

14:25.124 --> 14:26.891
Wait, were you guys
watching me get changed?

14:26.959 --> 14:29.059
Is that the only reason
you invited me?

14:29.127 --> 14:30.259
You guys are gross.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.893
I'm your cousin, Jimmy.

14:31.961 --> 14:33.495
Ask them
about the visitation ritual.

14:33.563 --> 14:36.833
What is the visitation ritual?

14:36.900 --> 14:39.300
Uh, my grandpa said that
if you dress up in the costumes,

14:39.368 --> 14:41.405
then chant and dance
or something,

14:41.472 --> 14:44.045
some sort of half-man,
half-dog god

14:44.113 --> 14:46.178
comes down to visit
the chosen one,

14:46.246 --> 14:49.780
and if it's you, the god
leads you to happiness.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.115
JIMMY:
Oh, and the god's name.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.750
Yeah, his name was Mataman.

14:52.817 --> 14:54.249
Mataman.

14:54.316 --> 14:55.984
Matama...

14:56.052 --> 14:57.822
Matt Damon?

14:57.889 --> 15:00.191
The-the god's name
is Matt Damon?

15:00.259 --> 15:01.859
WILFRED (chuckles):
Wow!

15:01.927 --> 15:03.561
That is a crazy coincidence.

15:03.629 --> 15:05.530
Two gods, the same name!

15:05.598 --> 15:06.797
Thanks.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.532
(muttering)

15:08.600 --> 15:10.267
That's insane.

15:10.334 --> 15:12.967
Okay, I can see me sending
the envelope to myself,

15:13.034 --> 15:15.203
but you think I went online
and hired kid actors

15:15.271 --> 15:17.971
and created those costumes and
gave them scripts to perform?

15:18.039 --> 15:20.036
I don't know how you did it,
but you must have somehow.

15:20.104 --> 15:21.937
What about your premonitions?

15:22.005 --> 15:24.173
H-How could I possibly have
known about your premonitions?

15:24.241 --> 15:25.574
I don't know.
I must have mumbled them

15:25.642 --> 15:27.108
when I was passed out
on the stairs.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.642
Or maybe they were premonitions

15:28.709 --> 15:30.241
and this is all real!

15:30.309 --> 15:32.275
I'm not getting
sucked in, Wilfred.

15:32.342 --> 15:34.644
Things are going so well
between my dad and me right now.

15:34.712 --> 15:37.179
Look, if he found out about
our little adventure today,

15:37.247 --> 15:39.183
uh, it would ruin everything.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.751
I'm not lying, and I'm not
trying to ruin anything.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.249
I want answers
just as much as you do.

15:44.317 --> 15:46.015
I have to go back to the office.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.517
I also want my friend back.

15:47.584 --> 15:50.383
Go home, Wilfred.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.063
(phone buzzing)

16:10.170 --> 16:11.269
Hey, Dad.

16:11.336 --> 16:12.802
How'd the hearing go?

16:12.870 --> 16:14.940
Come on, Ryan.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.942
I know you've been lying to me
about Wilfred.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.914
I know you left the office
to be with that dog today.

16:19.981 --> 16:21.885
I...

16:21.952 --> 16:23.621
Ryan,

16:23.689 --> 16:25.592
I saw you in the car
with the dog.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.495
You know I saw you.

16:27.562 --> 16:29.364
God, this is worse
than I thought.

16:29.432 --> 16:31.300
I'm taking you to get some help.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.201
God, this is worse
than I thought.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.070
I'm taking you to get some help.

16:36.138 --> 16:37.272
Stay there.

16:37.339 --> 16:39.442
I'm coming to the office.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.998
♪ ♪

17:17.673 --> 17:19.807
(line ringing)

17:19.875 --> 17:20.976
HENRY:
Hello?

17:21.042 --> 17:22.444
Dad, it's me.

17:22.512 --> 17:23.952
If you're coming
from the courthouse,

17:24.012 --> 17:25.180
don't go anywhere.
I'm coming to you.

17:25.248 --> 17:26.381
Ryan, I think...

17:26.449 --> 17:28.282
(line beeps)
Dad?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.354
Dad?

17:41.263 --> 17:42.997
That's my dad's car.

17:43.065 --> 17:44.331
Where is he?

17:44.399 --> 17:46.466
My God.

17:46.534 --> 17:48.668
No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:48.736 --> 17:50.704
Not again! Not again!

17:57.665 --> 17:59.164
WILFRED:
I still don't understand

17:59.231 --> 18:00.565
how this statue
is connected to anything.

18:00.632 --> 18:01.357
I mean,

18:01.477 --> 18:03.869
the Noid, yeah,
the guy's dangerous,

18:03.912 --> 18:05.552
but not to us.
It's not like we're pizzas.

18:06.051 --> 18:07.884
I told you, it's
a statue of you.

18:07.952 --> 18:09.419
I'm the Noid?

18:09.487 --> 18:11.857
Well, I guess that makes sense.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.991
I have destroyed
my share of pizzas.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.095
(sighs)

18:18.162 --> 18:20.029
How you holding up, man?

18:24.132 --> 18:26.770
(sighs)

18:28.105 --> 18:29.973
I don't get it.

18:30.041 --> 18:33.110
My dad and I were better
than we'd ever been.

18:34.779 --> 18:35.879
And then,

18:35.947 --> 18:37.547
I lied to him about you,

18:37.615 --> 18:39.147
and he clearly
followed me that day.

18:39.214 --> 18:41.316
Otherwise, how could he
have seen us in the car?

18:41.384 --> 18:43.754
Why were we given
a second chance

18:43.822 --> 18:45.624
if it was always supposed
to end like this?

18:45.691 --> 18:46.990
You know,

18:47.058 --> 18:48.857
back in Wisconsin,

18:48.925 --> 18:51.596
there was a fence post

18:51.664 --> 18:53.798
up the street from Jenna.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.365
Every day,
I'd go up to the post,

18:56.433 --> 18:58.736
chew it, sniff it,
take a leak on it.

18:58.803 --> 19:00.769
I loved that damn post.

19:00.837 --> 19:03.171
But one day, I was licking it,

19:03.238 --> 19:06.240
and it gave me a splinter
in my tongue.

19:06.308 --> 19:08.341
Ah, I just felt so betrayed.

19:10.245 --> 19:12.378
So I just started
walking past it,

19:12.446 --> 19:13.745
just pretending
it wasn't even there.

19:13.813 --> 19:15.880
Then one day, suddenly,

19:15.948 --> 19:17.883
the post was gone.

19:17.951 --> 19:19.316
I felt devastated

19:19.384 --> 19:21.217
and guilty.

19:23.722 --> 19:26.223
I never had a chance
to make amends.

19:28.995 --> 19:31.897
You got that moment, mate.

19:34.199 --> 19:36.699
Maybe you are the god
who leads you to happiness.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.602
(chuckles)

19:40.406 --> 19:43.107
I'm sorry about the way
I've been treating you.

19:43.174 --> 19:45.442
It's okay.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.011
Seven forgives.

19:47.079 --> 19:48.615
I mean, as crazy as it is,

19:48.682 --> 19:50.483
the premonitions were real.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.854
Well, except the last one.

19:53.922 --> 19:55.789
You never actually betrayed me.

20:01.162 --> 20:03.495
Ryan, I have a confession
to make.

20:03.563 --> 20:05.264
I did betray you.

20:05.332 --> 20:07.634
When we were driving

20:07.701 --> 20:09.338
to the park, I...

20:09.405 --> 20:12.008
I stole one
of your chicken nuggets.

20:12.076 --> 20:14.677
(laughs)

20:14.745 --> 20:16.244
I forgive you.

20:19.546 --> 20:20.579
(sighs)
Oh, man.

20:20.647 --> 20:22.147
This is gonna take a while.

20:22.215 --> 20:23.916
I have to go
through my dad's e-mails,

20:23.984 --> 20:26.690
get his contacts, let everybody
know what happened.

20:26.757 --> 20:28.494
If you grab some more tape,
I can help with the boxes

20:28.561 --> 20:29.696
while you're doing that.

20:29.763 --> 20:30.963
That'd be great.

20:31.031 --> 20:31.964
Thanks.
