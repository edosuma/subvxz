[woman]
Previously onQueen Sugar:

00:02.872 --> 00:06.180
My mother taught me
to believe in what's good.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.616
You're good.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.705
-What's wrong, baby?
-That's Nova's doing.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.402
She spit in my face.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.056
I'm never going to forgive her.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.276
If you decide to run
you'll discover the Landrys

00:15.319 --> 00:17.234
are just the tip of the spear.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.148
This isn't allowed.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.628
You made more enemies in a day

00:19.671 --> 00:21.064
than I've made in a lifetime.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.805
My pops is my daddy.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.372
But she says he ain't
your real one.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.417
Is that why I look different
than you?

00:26.461 --> 00:28.245
As long as my heart is beatin',
Blue,

00:28.289 --> 00:29.246
I'm gonna be your daddy.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.552
I chose you.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.430
[Octavia]
Oh!

00:39.474 --> 00:42.694
Beautiful, as usual.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.087
It's not too buttoned up?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.090
It is a serious suit
for a serious woman.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.091
[sighs]

00:48.135 --> 00:49.614
Packed press day tomorrow.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.138
Hopefully my feet
can take it.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.835
Oh, comfort is overrated

00:52.878 --> 00:55.881
when you look as amazing
as you do right now.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.710
Oh, I've connected with some
colleagues here in Atlanta

00:58.754 --> 01:00.973
to help drum up more
highbrows in the press.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.933
And there's a shindig this week
at that new social club.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.196
Lots of notables
should be there.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
You stay plugged in.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.678
I can give my publicist a call
to get us on the list.

01:09.721 --> 01:12.724
Oh, but we are already VIP,
my queen.

-I thought you might like that.

I loved it!

01:53.635 --> 01:55.158
[cell phone vibrates]

01:56.333 --> 01:58.553
Hey, Deborah.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.685
Yeah, sure. I could always
use good news.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.515
What?

02:05.386 --> 02:06.952
What do you mean?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.955
I can't believe this.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.175
Wow.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.960
Thank you.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.179
Okay.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.138
Talk soon.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.229
I've been shortlisted
for the National Book Award!

02:22.272 --> 02:23.360
I can't...

02:23.404 --> 02:25.319
I can't even
believe this!

02:25.362 --> 02:27.321
Congratulations, Nova.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.411
This could get my book
in front of so many more people

02:30.454 --> 02:31.673
who need help.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.283
And I think it could really
help my family

02:33.327 --> 02:35.546
see the value and reach
of our story.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.722
I mean, I can't believe this.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.376
This is incredible.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.552
Yes. Yes, it is.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.772
But remember, Nova,

02:43.815 --> 02:46.209
you don't need an award
to help people.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.429
You don't need an award
for validation.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.779
Yes. I-I know that.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.349
I don't mean to rain
on your parade.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.307
I'm just being real with you.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.917
Reminding you
of who you are,

02:58.961 --> 03:01.224
and to keep it all
in the proper perspective.

03:01.268 --> 03:05.924
Baby, you are worthy
right now, period.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.318
Point-blank. The end.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.761
[Darla] Maybe I should
take him to school,

03:16.805 --> 03:18.807
so he doesn't miss
the whole day.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.939
I don't know.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.594
Maybe we should let him
take a break today.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.857
Did you make
the appointment?

03:29.731 --> 03:31.254
I didn't get around
to it yet.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.299
I'm working on it.

03:32.342 --> 03:36.477
Ralph Angel,
he just found out

03:36.520 --> 03:39.349
about you, about us.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.872
He's a kid.

03:40.916 --> 03:44.136
We need to make sure
that he's going to be okay.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.836
They even said
they'd come to us.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.541
There it is.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.195
It's official.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.327
[sighs]

04:00.370 --> 04:02.372
Is it the right decision?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.201
If you believe in it,
it's the right decision.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.467
Candidate Bordelon,
I'm with you all the way.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.643
You got this.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.732
[Micah] All right,
so we're all going to pair up

04:14.776 --> 04:16.473
and each take
a neighborhood.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.301
[Charley] Yeah, we actually
don't have much time

04:18.345 --> 04:20.041
to get this on the ballot,
so we've got to talk

04:20.084 --> 04:21.870
to every registered voter
in St. Jo

04:21.913 --> 04:24.438
and get them to back
our anti-highway proposal.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.048
We can get it done.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.528
We hit the pavement every day
until we do.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.225
That's right.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.532
I'm from across the way,
in St. Thomas.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.490
We've got skin
in the game too.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.101
I heard you were
announcing soon.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.407
I don't waste much time.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.062
I like that.
I like that a whole lot.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.673
So I'm here to lend you
a hand, young lady.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.675
Wow. Thank you.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.373
I love your enthusiasm.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.767
And I'm so happy that
St. Thomas is joining the fight.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.029
Your name, ma'am?

04:51.073 --> 04:52.422
This is Lady Genevieve.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.163
Leon Durand's
baby sister.

04:54.206 --> 04:58.210
Baby sister?
I'm a grown woman, Mr. Prosper.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.300
But it's good
to see you again.

05:01.431 --> 05:05.087
It's good to see you too,
Lady Genevieve.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.570
Okay...

05:09.613 --> 05:10.832
let's do it.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.355
Let's get to work.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.400
Yeah.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.318
So, how have you been?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.058
Very well,
thank you for asking.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.409
Thank you for showing
your respects to Leon.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.541
Yeah, well,
the least I could do.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.978
For him and so many others,
unfortunately.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.372
How many has it been for you
this year?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.331
Funerals?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.421
I stopped counting
after the fifth one.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.031
Time does slip on by,

05:36.074 --> 05:39.251
whether we ready
for it or not.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.036
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.429
Come on over here.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.431
I'm happy to canvas
the Latinx neighborhoods,

05:44.474 --> 05:46.389
but they're going to want
to hear from you directly.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.610
Of course. I'm planning to make
some inroads later this week.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.263
Councilwoman Barrera
will be campaigning

05:51.307 --> 05:53.396
a lot there for us
as well, so...

05:53.440 --> 05:56.138
You might want to be there
yourself more often than not.

05:56.181 --> 05:59.533
I mean, no disrespect,
but they already know her.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.795
They'll want to know you.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.580
Does "they" have a name?

06:03.624 --> 06:06.801
It sounds like you're talking
about someone specific.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.237
Well, yeah, yeah.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.239
I would start
with Angel Martinez.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.502
He's a pastor
of St. Jo's Episcopal Church.

06:12.546 --> 06:13.895
Across town.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.418
You know it?

06:15.462 --> 06:16.811
Not yet.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.813
But I'm just getting started.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.598
Hey...

06:22.773 --> 06:24.514
are you sure
you want to do this?

06:25.689 --> 06:27.343
I know you've
thought this through.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.565
But the Landry/Boudreaux family,
I mean,

06:31.608 --> 06:33.393
they're a lot.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.482
I'm a lot.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.532
Whatever I have to do,
whomever I need to talk to,

06:42.576 --> 06:44.229
I'll do it.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.580
For St. Jo.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.235
And for my daddy.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.847
I can't lose his land.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.984
I know.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.595
Baby, I ain't blaming you.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.510
I just want to make sure
you okay.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.514
I'm fine.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.559
Don't make a big deal
about it.

07:09.603 --> 07:13.215
It just doesn't happen
every time.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.825
Not for us.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.003
Usually, I'm the one
that got to catch up,

07:19.047 --> 07:21.441
and you ready to go.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.619
[sighs]

07:27.098 --> 07:28.839
I'm tired, that's all.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.538
Are you sure?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.671
I'm sure, baby.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
[clears throat]

07:39.284 --> 07:40.503
Sorry.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.635
Just a bit keyed up.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.245
Still getting used
to being the one

07:43.288 --> 07:44.594
who's being interviewed.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.856
-Thank you.
-You are a natural star.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.598
You always were.
I'll be right outside.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.601
I'm sorry.
Dr. Laurent, right?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.647
I didn't catch how you two
were associated.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.300
Oh, I'm Nova's
former professor.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.650
Just tagging along
for the day,

07:56.693 --> 07:59.000
doing a faculty write-up
for the alumni magazine.

07:59.043 --> 08:03.047
You know, I've had the pleasure
over the years

08:03.091 --> 08:06.964
of watching Nova grow
as a writer and an activist,

08:07.008 --> 08:10.751
so it's gratifying to see
her recent success up close.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.535
You probably have
some great stories.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.581
Those would probably
have to be off the record.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.018
[all laugh]

08:17.061 --> 08:18.976
Let's get started.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.544
Why a story
about your family?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
What were you trying
to uncover?

08:23.415 --> 08:24.678
First and foremost,

08:24.721 --> 08:26.636
I was trying to uncover
the truth.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.638
And then use that truth
to make connections

08:28.682 --> 08:29.944
to a broader
American narrative.

08:29.987 --> 08:33.774
How has sharing the truth
with the world

08:33.817 --> 08:36.515
impacted you
and your family?

08:37.778 --> 08:40.823
The truth can be difficult
to face sometimes.

08:40.868 --> 08:44.959
But on the other side of that
confrontation is healing.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.657
And healing takes time.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.659
Let's switch topics
for a bit.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.226
I want to make sure
we cover this.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.662
Your sister Charley

08:52.706 --> 08:55.709
is preparing to announce
her run for city council

08:55.752 --> 08:57.406
in your hometown.

08:57.449 --> 09:02.106
Would you say your activism
has rubbed off on her?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.810
Black women's influence
on one another

09:09.853 --> 09:12.552
is such an overlooked
tradition.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.118
Of course Nova's activism

09:14.162 --> 09:16.860
has influenced her sister's
budding interest,

09:16.904 --> 09:21.430
just as my work has influenced
Nova's intellectual curiosity.

09:21.473 --> 09:25.565
Black girl magic is more
of a continuum.

09:34.835 --> 09:38.273
Blue, can you tell me
what happened at school?

09:39.230 --> 09:40.797
Friend told him that--

09:40.841 --> 09:43.800
Please, Mr. Bordelon,
I'd like to hear from Blue.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.588
What's your doll's name?

09:52.679 --> 09:53.680
Kenya.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.030
Does Kenya know
what happened?

09:56.073 --> 09:57.771
Maybe she could tell us?

09:58.902 --> 10:02.776
Kenya says that Marcus said...

10:03.820 --> 10:06.649
that my pops
isn't my real pops.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.830
Thank you for sharing that.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.919
The first thing
I want you to know

10:15.963 --> 10:17.791
is that none of this
is your fault.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.836
You didn't do anything wrong.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.796
Everyone's family
looks different.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.145
What's most important
about family

10:24.188 --> 10:26.713
is that it's made up
of people who love you.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.804
Let's take a break.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.762
Blue, you want to go play
for a bit?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.808
-Yes.
-All right, come on.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.769
Okay.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.256
I think this is going to be
really good for Blue.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.258
Yeah, I hope so.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.831
[sighs]

10:57.874 --> 10:58.962
Blue's a great kid.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.921
It may not seem like it now,

11:00.964 --> 11:04.402
but Blue's processing this
in a fairly normal way.

11:05.316 --> 11:08.580
That may also be because he's
yet to grasp what it all means.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.452
What can we do
to help?

11:10.495 --> 11:11.714
Be patient.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
Acceptance takes time.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.676
This can be a lot
for co-parents to handle.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.895
Let's try an exercise.

11:18.939 --> 11:23.378
I want each of you
to write a list of the dreams,

11:23.421 --> 11:24.858
big or small,

11:24.901 --> 11:27.861
that you have
for you and Blue.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.210
Okay.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.734
It's important for you
to visualize the future.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.040
And Blue needs to understand

11:33.083 --> 11:35.912
that his future is more
important than his past.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.175
That starts with both of you.

11:58.195 --> 12:01.242
Everything's in range,
Violet.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.026
-Normal.
-I sure don't feel normal.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.202
Whatever symptoms
you're experiencing,

12:05.246 --> 12:07.291
they're not related
to your lupus medication.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.946
Well, if it ain't got nothing
to do with my medication,

12:09.990 --> 12:11.818
I don't know
what's going on.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.385
Quite honestly,
for the last few weeks,

12:14.429 --> 12:17.214
you know, I've been having
trouble in the bedroom.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.782
I just haven't been
in the mood,

12:19.826 --> 12:22.350
and that ain't me.

12:22.393 --> 12:25.048
I mean, that ain't me.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.877
You said this started
a few weeks ago?

12:27.921 --> 12:30.227
Any major life events recently?

12:30.271 --> 12:33.361
Something unexpected
or traumatic?

12:36.538 --> 12:38.975
Unexpected or traumatic?

12:40.934 --> 12:42.326
Try both.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.766
Jimmy Dale,
my ex-husband,

12:46.809 --> 12:48.942
is definitely both.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.864
Still looking at that?

12:57.907 --> 13:00.823
It wasn't fair of him
to spring that on you.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.217
It's a big deal that Charley
is running.

13:03.260 --> 13:07.134
If she wins, she can bring
real change to St. Jo.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.615
And I'm here...

13:10.659 --> 13:13.096
giving fluff interviews.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.317
One, you're a star now.
Goes with the territory.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.058
And two, so what?

13:18.101 --> 13:20.930
So what?
I'm talking about my family.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.758
They're important to me.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.020
[sighs]

13:24.064 --> 13:25.195
You know how I feel
about family.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.502
They're just biological
accidents.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.982
I hate it
when you say that.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.853
-[sighs]
-It's not true.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.855
At least not for me.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.990
Would you and your sister be
friends if you weren't related?

13:38.078 --> 13:40.297
-I'm not sure we're friends now.
-Exactly.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.170
Sometimes we have to put family
in the rearview

13:43.213 --> 13:45.912
to get to where
we want to go.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.099
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.927
Thanks for dropping
this off.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.276
You're welcome.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.367
Want to come in?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.156
I would have
picked it up myself,

14:13.200 --> 14:14.462
-I just--
-It's no big deal.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.681
I mean, I was
heading out anyway.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.077
Well, I'll see you later.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.298
Keke, I'm going to see Ant
again later.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.604
I was hoping that you
would come with me.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.129
Only immediate family
can see him in juvie.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.782
The warden checked me out,

14:30.826 --> 14:34.874
and thought I could be
a good influence on Ant.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.530
Of course you are.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.055
I'm happy that you're going
to see him.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.405
It's good for Ant
to see a friendly face.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.149
Keke, I was hoping
we could talk.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.675
I don't feel like it
right now, Micah.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.939
Maybe later.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.899
Okay.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.815
See you.
Give Ant my love.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.517
[door closes]

15:09.560 --> 15:11.171
[Ralph Angel]
That was quick.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.781
[Hollywood]
Wasn't no lines.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.742
A couple of the workers was
talking about that highway.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.702
Wondering if Charley's
going to be able to stop it.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.660
[Ralph Angel]
Yeah, me too.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.187
Say, bro,
you all right?

15:27.230 --> 15:29.189
Just tired, man.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.452
Ain't been sleeping.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.628
Between the highway
and Nova's book...

15:33.671 --> 15:35.978
-[scoffs]
-...been hella stressed.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.676
We should've burned
that damn book all the way up.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.027
Me and Darla getting Blue
therapy over it.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.767
-Say what?
-Yeah.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.378
Damn.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.945
But did it help?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.294
I don't know yet.

15:47.337 --> 15:52.125
Got us doing, like,
a dream list or something.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.996
What's a dream list?

15:54.040 --> 15:58.609
Me and Darla supposed
to think about Blue's future.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.046
What we want it
to look like.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.962
I'm just thinking
about today.

16:03.005 --> 16:06.313
I'll think about tomorrow
tomorrow, feel me?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.495
You ever ask yourself

16:14.538 --> 16:17.454
if tomorrows
are for other folk?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.764
Me and Vi, man,
we supposed to be living in up.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.115
We got love.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.291
A little bit of money.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.901
Doing it.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.949
But stuff that happened before
we was even a "we", man,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.560
is just hanging onto us
like a bad cold.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.739
Bedtime's even chilly.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.091
But shit, man,
that ain't no way to live.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.224
Sitting around,
scared that your past

16:48.268 --> 16:50.879
is going to snatch up
your future.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.535
Y'all meant to be, though.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.580
Everybody knows that.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.714
So don't give up.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.373
How often do you all
get together like this?

17:06.415 --> 17:08.201
The church does this
every so often.

17:08.243 --> 17:09.376
We call it a carne asada.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.290
It's like our version
of a barbeque.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.250
It's always great people,
great music,

17:14.294 --> 17:15.598
great food.

17:16.512 --> 17:17.819
Let me get you
more tamales.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.951
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.257
Excuse me.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.700
Thank you for coming.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.354
You know it means a lot to me

17:31.398 --> 17:34.488
that you are getting to know
Romero a little.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.753
You really like him, huh?

17:38.796 --> 17:41.190
-I do.
-[both laugh]

17:41.234 --> 17:43.105
I mean, I don't--
I don't know where it's going.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.717
All I know is I feel happy
when I'm with him.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.371
That's all that matters.

17:49.329 --> 17:52.201
You deserve to be happy.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.902
-Okay...
-Thank you.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.949
[Charley] So tell me
about Pastor Martinez.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.646
I thought it'd be a good idea
to meet him

18:02.690 --> 18:04.474
and his members
on his own turf.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.563
He respects that.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.957
Thank you.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.002
Of course.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.922
Okay. Um...

18:17.966 --> 18:20.273
I'm going to head to Malik's,
but I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

18:20.316 --> 18:22.144
-Okay.
-[Micah] Okay.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.885
Peace.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.891
Time to make friends.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.467
Hi. Pastor Martinez?

18:41.642 --> 18:43.992
Miss Bordelon.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.864
Uh, you know me?

18:46.908 --> 18:49.171
Everyone knows you,
Charley Bordelon.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.000
And I hear the same is true
of you, Pastor.

18:52.043 --> 18:56.091
So, what brings you to our side
of the tracks?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.571
[laughs]

18:57.614 --> 19:02.228
Just enjoying a neighborhood
party in our community.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.186
"Our"?

19:04.230 --> 19:07.189
I see. Well, while you're here,
try the flautas.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.538
My mother made them.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.367
I already did.
They were delicious.

19:15.241 --> 19:20.420
Thanks so much for allowing me
to be here.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.030
I'd love to visit more.

19:22.073 --> 19:25.947
I hope to see more
of your parishioners very soon.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.427
Good.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.776
But you should know,

19:28.819 --> 19:30.343
I'm not one of those
so amazed

19:30.386 --> 19:32.083
that you can dance
a little merengue

19:32.127 --> 19:35.435
that you automatically get
a permanent invite to la fiesta.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.482
You don't trust me.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.049
Before today,

19:41.092 --> 19:43.443
I've never seen you
in our neighborhoods.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.445
Why should I trust you?

19:46.402 --> 19:47.577
Understood.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.623
I hope that you'll
give me the chance

19:49.666 --> 19:52.756
to prove myself
worthy of your vote,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.628
of your parishioners' votes.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.501
I want you to vote for me,

19:58.545 --> 20:01.765
not because I'm the lesser
of two evils,

20:01.809 --> 20:04.159
but because you believe in me

20:04.203 --> 20:08.859
and my desire for all of us
to rise together.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.692
Thank you for your time, Pastor.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.265
[woman]
So did your father really--?

20:23.309 --> 20:25.354
[Nova]
As I wrote in my book,
I don't know for sure.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.051
I simply ask the question.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.315
I care more about all of us
living with so many secrets

20:29.358 --> 20:30.316
more than anything else.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.882
I got to tell you, though,

20:31.926 --> 20:33.406
I was rooting for you
and that white guy.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.321
-What's his name again?
-Calvin.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.583
Yes. Calvin.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.411
Now come on, girl.
Real talk.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.109
You knew that wasn't going
to work with a married man.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.416
But who hasn't dated
a white married man?

20:43.459 --> 20:45.374
Am I right, ladies?

20:45.418 --> 20:46.419
[all giggle]

20:46.462 --> 20:48.203
Excuse us.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.205
[Nova]
Wow.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.467
[Octavia]
Don't worry about them.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.077
They don't mean anything.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.949
I don't know how you do
this scene so often.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.646
It feels so superficial.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.908
You get used to it.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.475
Think of it as a game

20:59.519 --> 21:01.825
where the goal is to stay in it
as long as you can.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.566
There's only one problem
with that.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.307
I was never one
for playing games.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.657
Well, we all have to play
at some point

21:07.701 --> 21:10.356
if we want
any real success.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.401
There's Lisette.
I should go say hi.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.534
Hey!

21:16.100 --> 21:18.364
-Hi.
-[lips smack]

21:19.756 --> 21:21.584
[Lisette] I thought
the book was brilliant.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.194
I'm thinking of asking Nova

21:23.238 --> 21:25.327
to edit a collection of essays
on race.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.330
That's not really
Nova's forte.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.854
But I have been looking
for my next project

21:30.898 --> 21:33.335
and it sounds
absolutely perfect.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.990
[Lisette] Your past work
is still important.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.297
But the series I'm launching
is called Fresh Voices.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.516
It's specifically
for emerging writers.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.562
Maybe you could write
the foreword.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.085
The foreword?

21:44.128 --> 21:45.869
-Mm-hmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

21:45.913 --> 21:48.176
Oh, excuse me.
I have to get this.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.656
Take care.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
What was that all about?

21:55.270 --> 21:58.360
I was just singing
your praises.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.928
And I set us up
a lunch date for tomorrow.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.409
The new Dean of Faculty
at Princeton is in town,

22:03.452 --> 22:05.541
and he wants to meet us.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.542
[giggles]

22:06.586 --> 22:08.631
Oh, I'll be right back.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.204
[dance music playing]

22:24.125 --> 22:27.084
So how did things go
with Pastor Martinez?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.436
No, not really.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.176
Not yet.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.876
But I'm happy.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.139
Why is that?

22:39.619 --> 22:42.578
Because you brought me
into your world.

No strings attached.

Tried to do something for me.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.981
I can't remember the last time
a man added to my life

22:54.024 --> 22:56.026
without taking from it.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.552
Or tried to change me.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.294
Thank you.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.820
You deserve good things,
Charley.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.651
So do you.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.444
And I think you've waited
long enough.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.578
We both have.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.521
[cell phone chimes]

24:42.785 --> 24:44.787
[sighs]

24:49.575 --> 24:51.707
You look like you're seriously
over it.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.883
Some of it or all of it?

24:53.927 --> 24:56.103
What can I start you with?

24:56.146 --> 24:57.713
Something strong.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.281
Anything, really.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.065
-You coming or going?
-I came, I saw,

25:02.109 --> 25:04.590
and now I'm blowing this joint
tomorrow morning.

25:04.633 --> 25:07.070
Oh. Doesn't sound like
the best trip.

25:07.114 --> 25:10.552
Sometimes the bar is higher
than your reach.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.685
This one's on me.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.520
Thank you.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.869
This is fantastic.

25:22.912 --> 25:26.481
I call that one,
Drop It Like It's Hot.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.222
[both laugh]

25:28.265 --> 25:29.658
Okay.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.009
I'm Terrence.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.536
[sighs]

25:42.410 --> 25:43.585
Nova.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.588
Now, Nova,
why are you--

25:46.632 --> 25:50.592
As beautiful as organic brown
sugar, the whole package--

25:50.636 --> 25:54.814
Alone here in this hotel bar?

25:54.857 --> 25:56.946
Currently I'm being accompanied
by an old friend

25:56.990 --> 25:58.600
for my book tour.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.734
An old friend who I should've
left where I found her.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.997
So now I'm here,
all alone...

26:05.476 --> 26:07.609
trying not to make the same
mistake I made last time.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.784
I mean, if you're
up to it later,

26:08.828 --> 26:10.830
there's a lounge nearby
with a DJ

26:10.873 --> 26:13.093
where you can sweat out
all your problems.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.182
That all sounds lovely.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.445
But you've done enough.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.882
Thank you for the conversation.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.492
I appreciate it.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.280
Hey. Absolutely.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.718
[Blue] Did you know that beaks
are also called bills?

26:29.762 --> 26:30.719
I knew that.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.634
[Blue]
And a black skimmer

26:32.678 --> 26:36.290
uses a longer bill
to skim food

26:36.333 --> 26:37.683
out of the water.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.598
Interesting.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.993
Are there other animals
besides birds that can talk?

26:44.037 --> 26:46.343
Hmm, I don't know.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.172
That's a very good question.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.697
I guess you could say
a lot of animals talk,

26:51.740 --> 26:54.003
just in their own way.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.788
Like how dogs bark.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.791
-And cats meow.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

26:58.834 --> 26:59.879
[gasps]

26:59.922 --> 27:01.794
Have you ever seen
a flamingo?

27:01.837 --> 27:03.099
They're really tall.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.711
-Taller than me?
-They're not that tall.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.669
-[laughs]
-Not that tall.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.106
"After the mother penguin
lays the egg,

27:10.150 --> 27:13.066
"it's the job of the father
penguin to stay with the egg

"and keep it warm and safe

27:14.807 --> 27:17.940
"until the baby penguin
is ready to be born."

27:19.942 --> 27:22.162
Like how you
keep me safe, Pops.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.209
Yeah.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.950
Just like that.

[Blue]
A rainbow.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.612
Pastor?

27:39.832 --> 27:42.835
Your words last night
really touched me.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.925
I want you to know

27:45.968 --> 27:49.406
I'm serious about building
bridges between our communities.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.408
We should all be serious
about that.

27:51.452 --> 27:52.975
All the time.

27:56.718 --> 28:00.330
My commitment
to all of St. Jo is real.

28:00.374 --> 28:03.464
Black and Latinx residents
should work together and pool--

28:03.507 --> 28:05.466
You say that as if
it's easy to do.

28:05.509 --> 28:09.818
There are forces that prey on
our fears and use it against us.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.820
Sometimes we do it
to ourselves.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.655
You know, I think...

28:22.222 --> 28:25.834
I think some black people
feel like we're still fighting

28:25.878 --> 28:27.749
for basic equality,

28:27.793 --> 28:29.969
even though we're the ones
who built this country.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.711
And we're often the ones
who maintain it,

28:32.754 --> 28:34.060
by doing jobs others won't.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.888
I see that.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.281
They keep us fighting each other
while the powers that be

28:38.325 --> 28:39.892
are at the bank,
cashing checks.

28:43.373 --> 28:44.940
I need you to know...

28:46.725 --> 28:48.857
I am in this
for the long haul.

28:48.901 --> 28:52.339
Well, nothing's going
to be fixed overnight,

28:52.382 --> 28:55.168
and certainly not in time
for the city council election.

28:57.387 --> 29:01.827
But I welcome a continued
conversation between us.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.224
[engine rumbling]

29:15.101 --> 29:16.667
[engine turned off]

29:21.324 --> 29:23.762
What in the world?

29:26.982 --> 29:29.419
I know you did not
just buy that death trap.

29:29.463 --> 29:30.899
Well, hello to you too.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.988
And I most certainly did.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.598
You know it's always been
a dream of mine.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.688
Well, I am not riding
on that thing.

29:37.732 --> 29:41.040
I got this idea of you
just leaning on me,

29:41.083 --> 29:45.000
holding on to me while the wind
blows in our face.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.916
[laughs]

29:47.960 --> 29:49.613
Baby...

29:50.919 --> 29:53.835
I know I ain't been myself
with you lately,

29:53.879 --> 29:56.533
but it ain't got nothing
to do with you, baby.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.970
-Nothing.
-I know something is wrong.

29:58.013 --> 30:01.625
Could you please
just tell me?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.857
[sighs]

30:15.901 --> 30:18.860
So I talked to Dr. Badami.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.561
And today I realized

30:24.605 --> 30:26.912
that Jimmy Dale
coming back

30:26.955 --> 30:30.002
stirred up a lot
of stuff in me

30:30.045 --> 30:31.917
that I didn't know
was still there.

30:33.353 --> 30:36.965
It's taken everything I got
to just get through each day.

30:37.009 --> 30:41.752
It's messing with my mind,
and I'm mad as hell about that.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.934
So I'm asking
for your patience.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.066
Please.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.506
And for a little bit
of space.

30:56.550 --> 30:59.335
-From me?
-Just for a little while.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.991
I know it ain't fair.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.694
What is it they say?

31:11.739 --> 31:14.611
In sickness and in health...

31:14.655 --> 31:16.962

to ever deserve you,

31:20.661 --> 31:22.228
I will never know.

our lunch.

31:43.249 --> 31:46.817
All I've done for you
on this tour.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.081
You invited yourself
on this tour.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.956
keeping your spirits up.

Emotional labor
is still work, baby.

31:57.393 --> 31:59.918
I refuse to be treated
like an afterthought.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.268
You want to talk
about respect?

32:02.311 --> 32:04.835
You tried to take that book
opportunity from me.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.576
How could you?

32:06.620 --> 32:09.231
You're not qualified to do that
kind of work and you know it.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.146
They only want you
because you're hot,

32:11.190 --> 32:13.061
which, believe me,
cools quickly.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.759
When you've sustained
a 20-year career,

32:15.803 --> 32:17.283
then you come question me.

32:17.326 --> 32:20.112
You can keep your 20-year career
if it means lies and deceit.

her family under the bus

I'm not your student anymore.

32:27.902 --> 32:31.427
You do know
I made you, right?

32:32.515 --> 32:34.256
You were so green.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.737
I found you, saw you,

32:36.780 --> 32:38.173
spit-shined you

off your thinking.

Wow.

This is a sad day.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.492
I suspected it,
but now I know.

to make it possible for you.

just to be seen!

33:12.991 --> 33:15.384
I have tremendous respect
for you

33:15.428 --> 33:19.127
and all that you've done
for women like me.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.349

my own path

to do so.

you were always the one.

but I never crossed
that line again.

You were my first
in so many meaningful ways.

37:34.904 --> 37:38.473
in all the ways that you have
since you've been home.

37:39.866 --> 37:42.303
I've always admired
how you know what you want

37:42.347 --> 37:44.523
and you go after it,

37:44.566 --> 37:46.307
no matter what.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.049
I'm really proud of you.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.095
I miss you.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.881
I love you.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.492
Give my love to Micah.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.190
Night.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.849
[cheers and applause]

38:11.724 --> 38:15.467
Today, in the place
that I'm proud to call home,

38:15.510 --> 38:19.340
I am officially announcing
my candidacy for city council,

38:19.384 --> 38:20.907
and letting everyone know

38:20.950 --> 38:23.126
that it will take more
than a brick through my window

38:23.170 --> 38:26.216
to stop me from doing
what's right for our parish!

38:26.260 --> 38:28.218
[all cheer]

38:33.441 --> 38:37.489
Before I continue, I must thank
Councilwoman Isabel Barrera

38:37.532 --> 38:42.276
for her service to St. Jo
and for her gracious support.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.191
[applause]

38:45.410 --> 38:46.802
To our victory!

38:52.417 --> 38:55.507
We are not expendable.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.378
We will stop the highway.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.815
We will flourish
on our farms.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.514
We will protect
our community.

39:02.557 --> 39:05.778
Together, we will reclaim
our parish.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.476
We are St. Josephine's Parish

39:08.520 --> 39:11.305
in the grand state
of Louisiana,

39:11.349 --> 39:13.960
and we ain't going anywhere!

39:14.003 --> 39:16.049
