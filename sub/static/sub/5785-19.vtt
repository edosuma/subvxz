BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.916
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.094 --> 00:13.131
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.306 --> 00:16.264
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.893 --> 00:18.679
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.853 --> 00:21.765
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.230
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.695
Because I wanna go faster.
and you're the only one who can teach me.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.951
Everything you need is on this drive.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.154
It means a lot. You looking after Bany.

00:39.332 --> 00:41.618
Bany's not the only person here
I want to keep safe.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.250

00:51.844 --> 00:54.506
I thought that if I could
ﬁnd my doppelganger on this earth.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.638
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

00:57.808 --> 00:58.797
I've been vibing Zoom.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.266
And every time it's happened,
I've been near that thing.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.764
I saw Jay.

happen to us when we're children.

01:17.745 --> 01:22.330
The people who took me in helped me heal,
and move past everything that happened.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.082
They're responsible
for who I've become today.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.369
But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.535
Come on, Bany.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.670
BARRY: Not everyone gets
that kind of support.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.253
VWthout it, I don't know
where I would've ended up.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.964

Yeah, they're perfect.

Let's put it this way.
You just annihilated your old record.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.229
Yeah, you went four times faster
than you have ever been.

we can get this thing smaller?

is ﬁgure out how to get back to Zoom.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.592
Yes. uh, just a minor issue.

05:48.766 --> 05:51.428

give the man who kidnapped my daughter

06:07.910 --> 06:09.616
and tortured her a chance to do it again.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.967

with everything that he's done.

Right now, there is no way
to another earth, Allen.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.820

07:19.064 --> 07:21.555
That's good. No, I'm glad that
you're ﬁnding a way to move on

07:21.734 --> 07:23.850
without anything holding you back.
You deserve that.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.485

able to do it without your support.

-Of course.

this breach problem ﬁxed by tonight,

07:36.206 --> 07:37.457
pencil me in for tomorrow.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.081

I'm still trying to ﬁnd
a way back to Earth-2.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.643
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.227
No, he refused.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.894
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.279
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

08:10.449 --> 08:12.656
about a man I shot at
and punched in the face.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.532
but I think you should listen to him.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.909
Why?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.286
Bany, it worries the hell out of me.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.321
the thought that you wanna
go back to Earth-2.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.708
I'm faster now,
I'm faster than I've ever been.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.582
I can take him down.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.832
All I'm saying is, you already
escaped the hornet's nest once.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.386
Why go back and kick it again?

08:33.305 --> 08:34.294
Hey.

08:34.473 --> 08:38.432
Wally. We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.593
Hope it's cool, I brought my laundry over.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.762
Of course. Bany used to
do his laundry here all the time

08:42.940 --> 08:44.020
when he was in college.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.978
That's 'cause those machines in the dorm
always eat your quarters, right?

08:47.152 --> 08:49.404
Actually, I'm not
Iivin' on campus anymore.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.736
Since room and board
became way more expensive than I thought.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.026
Man, I can help you out with that.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.284
I mean, I ﬁgured your money

08:58.455 --> 09:00.446
must be tight after payin'
all your mother's medical bills.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.703
How much more is it?

09:04.795 --> 09:06.160
No, it's, uh... It's cool.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.578
Come on. Wally, let me help you out.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.668
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.
You can use that, too, if you want.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.299
Joe, I'm good, really.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.459
All right.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.756
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.973
Man, I can't ﬁgure
that kid out sometimes.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.973

that complicated.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.488
BARRY: Hey.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.160
Wow. Um...

09:37.327 --> 09:38.362
Any ideas?

09:38.537 --> 09:41.404
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

09:41.582 --> 09:44.824
is to set off a nuclear warhead
next to the city's electrical grid. So...

09:45.419 --> 09:47.455
We're not gonna do that. Um...

09:47.755 --> 09:49.916
I think I thought of something, though.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.259
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.418
:mm

09:56.597 --> 09:59.134
What were Reverb's powers on your earth?

09:59.308 --> 10:02.971
Well, he could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies between earths.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.682
He could see through dimensions.
ﬁnd breachers.

10:05.856 --> 10:06.891
.llﬂim

10:07.065 --> 10:09.317
I mean, we saw Reverb
do more than that, though, right?

10:09.485 --> 10:13.194
I mean, we saw him
shoot vibrational bursts out of his hands.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.819
Really painful ones.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.025
What do you mean?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.407
I... I mean, Reverb had the ability

10:18.577 --> 10:21.694
to somehow manipulate
that multi-dimensional energy.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.861
What's your point, Allen?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.656
My point is, if his powers are linked

10:25.834 --> 10:28.826
to the energy
that ties together the multi-verse

10:29.004 --> 10:30.619
and he can manipulate it?

10:30.798 --> 10:32.038
Then he can open a breach

10:32.216 --> 10:33.752
-to any earth he wants.
-Exactly.

10:33.926 --> 10:37.669
And if Reverb could do it,
I could do it, too.

10:38.764 --> 10:42.803
Cisco, I think that
the way back to Earth-2, is you.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.482
I got nothin'.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.407
Bany, what if he can't do it
because he thinks he can't do it?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.659
He can do it, though. You can do it.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.912

11:18.011 --> 11:19.717
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

11:19.888 --> 11:23.301

the right man for the job, right?

11:49.626 --> 11:50.832
-Um...

11:51.003 --> 11:52.539

11:54.214 --> 11:56.170
You know, you kind of look like that guy.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.330
I'm not him.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.794
Okay.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.176

locating my daughter?

12:22.326 --> 12:23.315
Not yet.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.485
But I've circulated her picture
through every department in the region.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.995
And I've reached out
to some friends in Keystone.

how to stay hidden. She's...

There's another thing also, Detective.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.007
A favor.

12:42.679 --> 12:48.174
I would ask you to talk Bany out of
reopening the breaches to my earth.

13:02.991 --> 13:07.781
Look, I think it's just as dumb as you do.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.993

I can't talk Bany out of anything

13:12.167 --> 13:13.577

He can't let it go.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.801
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.295
Go with Bany.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.137
Help him.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.423
Help him?

13:31.561 --> 13:32.892
Why would I do that?

13:33.438 --> 13:38.102

I couldn't do it.

Is that because of Eddie
or because of Bany?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.677

you've been looking at him recently.

Only to a woman who's been through
the same thing.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.258
Everything seems to be telling me
that Bany and I are meant to be together.

I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

18:24.562 --> 18:27.349

18:29.609 --> 18:32.271

if that should be with Bany.

pointing in that direction.

When Bany and Iris went to college,
they couldn't get away fast enough.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.027
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

It didn't even occur to me
that you might feel differently.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.525

but it took Bany to help me see that.
