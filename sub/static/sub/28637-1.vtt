Sometimes one will do more for the other

27:50.272 --> 27:51.964

27:52.785 --> 27:55.885
It hurts for your emotions you enjoy with

49:04.867 --> 49:07.037
Bitch, are you fucking crazy?

49:43.811 --> 49:44.958
Come here bitch

49:45.975 --> 49:48.271
If you tell anybody

49:48.296 --> 49:50.114
what you saw in here today

49:50.139 --> 49:52.169
am gonna fucking kill

49:52.373 --> 49:54.033
You understand?

49:54.120 --> 49:55.480
you understand me?

49:55.669 --> 49:56.898
yes, yes!

49:59.677 --> 50:00.757
Okay

50:03.010 --> 50:04.830
you can settle

50:30.149 --> 50:31.286
What are you doing here?

50:31.311 --> 50:33.211
Can we talk?

50:33.284 --> 50:35.114
Go talk to your girlfriend

50:35.361 --> 50:38.771
Erica, wait, alright?

50:38.872 --> 50:41.169
First of all, she's not my girl

50:41.194 --> 50:42.674
Second only did that to get you mad

50:42.699 --> 50:45.189
for dancing homeboy at the party

50:45.320 --> 50:48.310
That kiss they mean nothing to me

50:48.670 --> 50:50.607
Babe I'm sorry all right?

50:50.632 --> 50:52.762
And I love you

50:52.787 --> 50:53.833
How you know you love me?

50:53.858 --> 50:55.418
Because I do

50:56.445 --> 50:57.305
Well,

50:59.944 --> 51:02.489
there's only two things I'm afraid of losing

51:02.514 --> 51:04.854
One, my grandmother

51:05.653 --> 51:07.993
and two is you

51:09.178 --> 51:10.755
What about basketball?

51:10.783 --> 51:12.199
Basketball not to sing when I'm not

51:12.224 --> 51:14.730
with my number-one cheerleader

51:16.578 --> 51:18.818
That was cute

51:18.975 --> 51:21.125
Thank you

51:21.429 --> 51:23.159
Two conditions

51:23.285 --> 51:25.475
One, you tell that crazy white chick

51:25.717 --> 51:27.263
that you cannot talk breather

51:27.288 --> 51:28.558
or even smell around her

51:28.846 --> 51:29.833
Got it

51:33.006 --> 51:34.636
Two, come here

51:41.346 --> 51:42.936
Come on

51:51.453 --> 51:52.802
Dad, what's going on?

51:52.827 --> 51:53.966
Oh, hi honey

51:54.239 --> 51:56.552
this is Peggy, she's gonna look after you

51:56.577 --> 51:58.827
for a little while when I'm gone

51:58.950 --> 52:01.880
Hi Karma? nice to meet you

52:01.905 --> 52:03.739
am I missing something?

52:03.764 --> 52:04.661
honey come here, have a seat

52:04.686 --> 52:06.316
no I'm fine right here

52:06.341 --> 52:07.263
what’s going on?

52:07.288 --> 52:09.388
Oh, I got called back to duty

52:09.524 --> 52:10.949
I'm gonna be gone for a half a month

52:10.974 --> 52:12.262
maybe a little longer

52:12.583 --> 52:15.255
but Peggy's gonna look after you, while I'm gone

52:15.280 --> 52:17.325
I knew this was gonna happen

52:17.350 --> 52:19.482
this is why I want to stay in little bit with mom

52:19.507 --> 52:21.817
Oh, does she know about this?

52:21.889 --> 52:24.372
Actually, I haven't had a chance to call her

52:24.397 --> 52:28.263
but Peggy-- -
- I'm gonna call her

52:28.288 --> 52:30.378
She’s not gonna like this

52:30.403 --> 52:33.073
And I don't need some lady watching me

52:33.136 --> 52:36.006
she's not my mother

52:36.031 --> 52:37.357
John I think I should go

52:37.382 --> 52:39.472
No, Karma, listen up I'm your father

52:39.693 --> 52:43.693
I make the rules around here, you got it?

52:44.965 --> 52:46.568
Right dad

52:46.593 --> 52:48.661
What is she? your new bitch or something ?

52:48.774 --> 52:50.958
Whoa! whoa! watch your mouth

52:50.983 --> 52:52.573
It’s not about that

52:52.598 --> 52:55.810
and you don't talk to me or Peggy like that

52:55.835 --> 52:57.025
Just leave alone

52:57.220 --> 52:57.950
Karma come here

52:57.975 --> 52:58.943
I hate you

52:58.968 --> 52:59.427
Karma!

52:59.452 --> 53:01.752
I hate you!

53:59.165 --> 54:00.153
I made dinner, are you hungry?

54:00.178 --> 54:01.368
Don’t talk to me

54:05.735 --> 54:07.295
I got it

54:16.950 --> 54:18.280
What’s up Karma?

54:18.305 --> 54:19.044
You got a second?

54:19.069 --> 54:20.787
What do you want?

54:20.812 --> 54:22.622
I just wanna talk to you for a second

54:22.647 --> 54:23.977
Go back!

54:38.471 --> 54:40.521
Look I want to apologize about everything

54:40.546 --> 54:42.505
that happened the other night

54:42.530 --> 54:44.010
It’s okay

54:44.591 --> 54:47.200
I'm glad you understand, because

54:47.225 --> 54:49.513
you and I we can be friends, no more

54:49.538 --> 54:50.948
What?

54:51.411 --> 54:53.381
Always is Erica,

54:58.118 --> 55:00.513
But I thought we had something

55:00.538 --> 55:02.488
Come on Karma

55:02.513 --> 55:04.803
we will have nothing

55:06.499 --> 55:08.589
Look,

55:08.614 --> 55:11.834
you may negate a little depression alright?

55:12.594 --> 55:14.994
But you know I got a girlfriend

55:15.505 --> 55:18.815
And how many-- -
- Did you do this to get her jealous?

55:22.282 --> 55:24.662
I should have known

55:25.536 --> 55:28.076
Well, you don't do that to people

55:28.215 --> 55:30.146
you don't do that to people

55:30.171 --> 55:32.818
You don't make them think that it can be something

55:32.843 --> 55:34.903
and it's nothing

55:35.007 --> 55:35.794
Karma look

55:35.819 --> 55:37.089
You need to leave

55:37.218 --> 55:38.302
Karma look

55:38.327 --> 55:39.937
Jay, leave

55:40.225 --> 55:41.435
Karma

55:54.844 --> 55:55.755
Hey!

55:55.780 --> 55:56.760
Hey

55:58.028 --> 55:59.197
you called me back for more?

56:08.299 --> 56:10.059
Karma

56:10.229 --> 56:12.019
Karma come on now

56:12.285 --> 56:15.025
This is getting a bit uncomfortable

56:17.412 --> 56:18.760
Karma

56:18.785 --> 56:20.045
Yes

56:22.743 --> 56:24.343
Here you are

56:24.673 --> 56:26.593
You nice and comfy?

56:27.090 --> 56:29.060
Could be better

56:30.595 --> 56:31.947
don't worry

56:31.972 --> 56:34.252
A few minutes you will be

56:34.321 --> 56:35.002
You ready?

56:35.027 --> 56:36.227
Yeah

56:38.374 --> 56:40.454
Karma what the fuck

56:41.013 --> 56:42.833
Karma!

56:54.354 --> 56:55.384
So?

56:55.563 --> 56:57.307
I don't talk to him no more

56:57.794 --> 56:58.470
Wherever

56:58.495 --> 56:59.225
What!

57:00.346 --> 57:01.356
Wherever

57:01.446 --> 57:02.783
But what a you laughing for?

57:03.100 --> 57:04.072

- what about you?

57:04.097 --> 57:05.217
I got nothing to do with this,

57:05.523 --> 57:06.693
Get me out of here

57:06.939 --> 57:08.559
Wherever

57:12.844 --> 57:15.004
Is this bitch staring at me?

57:15.029 --> 57:16.299
No

57:16.324 --> 57:19.284
But I know she's better starering at me

57:19.405 --> 57:20.252
I'm about to go over there

57:20.277 --> 57:22.081
asked the bitch if she got a problem

57:22.106 --> 57:24.835
No, no, just leave her alone

57:31.288 --> 57:33.788
Hey yo, you got a problem?

57:34.700 --> 57:37.720
I said, do you have a problem?

57:41.538 --> 57:44.478
This bitch she thinks she big yeah,

57:45.632 --> 57:48.212
Don’t touch me

57:55.647 --> 57:57.817
That bitch is crazy

57:59.162 --> 58:02.542
You know why I tell over there messing with her

58:03.799 --> 58:05.010
I'll see all of them

58:05.035 --> 58:06.955
Alright

58:09.717 --> 58:10.862
Shit!

58:26.001 --> 58:27.432
Hey Jay

58:27.457 --> 58:29.397
what’s up Karma?

58:30.690 --> 58:32.626
You look different

58:32.651 --> 58:35.027
Is that a good thing you're about?

58:35.261 --> 58:38.011
For me, you look different

58:38.117 --> 58:39.387
Like it

58:39.753 --> 58:41.593
Hope you are

58:42.626 --> 58:44.726
I'm see you later all right?

58:44.751 --> 58:45.674
Jay

58:45.699 --> 58:46.712
Whoa!

58:46.737 --> 58:48.781
Stop, okay

58:48.888 --> 58:51.258
I told you, there's nothing between us

58:51.283 --> 58:52.940
You don't mean that

58:52.965 --> 58:55.835
Karma, I'm serious, stop

58:58.292 --> 58:59.338
Stay the fuck away from me

58:59.363 --> 59:00.659
Erica!

59:03.885 --> 59:06.189
Yo, wait up man

59:06.329 --> 59:08.479
Look, it's not what it looked like

59:08.541 --> 59:10.448
Then please explain it to me

59:10.473 --> 59:13.010
Tell me I didn't just see my man put the same bitch

59:13.035 --> 59:15.174
I told him to stay away from

59:15.199 --> 59:18.655
he same bitch you swore you had no feelings for

59:18.799 --> 59:19.471
You right

59:19.496 --> 59:21.213
Exactly

59:21.238 --> 59:22.588
You know,

59:22.613 --> 59:24.354
you aren’t shit

59:24.379 --> 59:26.949
you were supposed to be different

59:26.974 --> 59:30.394
Jay you're just like everybody else

59:32.321 --> 59:33.350
You know what,

59:33.375 --> 59:35.022
at times I wish I would have cheated

59:35.047 --> 59:36.042
You wish you were to what?

59:36.067 --> 59:38.917
I wish I would have cheated
- whats going on here?

59:40.153 --> 59:41.823
Ask the super star

59:41.856 --> 59:43.674
What’s going on Jay?

59:43.699 --> 59:44.919
Ms. William, do you remember you asked me

59:44.944 --> 59:46.734
to keep an eye on you on a new girl?

59:46.759 --> 59:47.440
Mm-hmm

59:47.465 --> 59:48.555
Well I did,

59:48.685 --> 59:51.455
Erica got the wrong impression about us

59:51.480 --> 59:53.330
Oh, Erica, I'm sorry

59:53.446 --> 59:56.146
Yeah,I did ask Jay,
 to just show her around the school

59:56.171 --> 59:59.791
she really needed adjusted to this place

01:00:03.084 --> 01:00:04.245
It’s totally my fault

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.770
don't be mad at Jay

01:00:07.321 --> 01:00:09.061
Is great, it’s just...

01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:10.620
I don't know, it’s hard

01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:12.315
He gives so much attention

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.700
Baby girl, let me tell you something

01:00:13.932 --> 01:00:17.525
If Jay cheats on pretty little things like you

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.557
Jay is a great athlete

01:00:21.582 --> 01:00:23.032
he's the star

01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:26.367
But he's a great person over all of us

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:30.448
and you, you're one of the good girls

01:00:30.473 --> 01:00:32.163
And trust me, and believe me

01:00:32.276 --> 01:00:35.292
he does not want to lose you

01:00:35.317 --> 01:00:36.637
I don't

01:00:37.189 --> 01:00:38.659
I'm sorry right?

01:00:38.684 --> 01:00:39.932
Yeah

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:40.674
Okay?

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:41.669
Yeah

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:44.409
All right you two up, lovebirds

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:47.417
go to class before I put both of you in detention

01:01:51.803 --> 01:01:53.713
I don't even know what to think

01:01:55.283 --> 01:01:56.873
What’s up babe?

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:03.690
I ask you why looking all sad as shit

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:05.760
You didn't hear what happened?

01:02:05.785 --> 01:02:06.995
No, what happened?

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.393
Ms. Williams, they found her in the school parking lot

01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:12.245
and she's dead on her car

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:16.270
Sarah, stop playing like that

01:02:17.559 --> 01:02:20.979
Yeah man,I heard she was suffocated over the bag

01:02:21.713 --> 01:02:23.043
Suffocated who with a bag?

01:02:23.068 --> 01:02:24.928
Just hold your mouth

01:02:25.377 --> 01:02:26.901
Ms. Williams

01:02:26.926 --> 01:02:28.745
What!

01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:30.081
We’ll talk bro

Get the fuck out of here

01:02:32.951 --> 01:02:36.174
She was such a good person

01:02:36.199 --> 01:02:38.399

01:02:54.068 --> 01:02:56.488

01:03:48.674 --> 01:03:51.054
Fuck man!

01:04:20.111 --> 01:04:22.811
She was like mother to me!

01:04:41.215 --> 01:04:42.667
Everyday fucking morning

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:44.057
She was there for me

01:04:44.082 --> 01:04:45.378
When my mother passed

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:46.612
when my girl lost her joy

01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:49.358
all of that!

01:05:55.894 --> 01:05:56.878
Oh, my God!

We just found Sarah dead upstairs So,

01:07:18.145 --> 01:07:19.562
Don’t play like that

01:07:19.587 --> 01:07:20.767

01:07:21.464 --> 01:07:23.158
Ouch! Jay!

01:07:24.698 --> 01:07:26.758
So what’s going on?

01:08:00.523 --> 01:08:03.593
Guys, guys wake up

01:08:09.448 --> 01:08:10.965
we got to get out of here

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.434
Wait, wait
we got go, come on

01:08:13.459 --> 01:08:13.864
Run!

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:14.630
What’s going on?

01:08:16.328 --> 01:08:19.089
Guys, we really need to get out of here

01:08:41.093 --> 01:08:42.354
I'm detective Lopez

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.831
this is my partner, detective Raymond

01:08:44.962 --> 01:08:45.769
OK

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:49.649
Ready to be taking over this case

01:08:49.953 --> 01:08:52.675
I'm sorry about what happened to you too

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.394
That must have been very traumatizing

01:08:55.593 --> 01:08:56.883
It was

01:08:58.709 --> 01:09:00.113
What’s going on?

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.721
We were just wondering if there's anyone

01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:03.147
that you might know of

01:09:03.263 --> 01:09:05.683
that might want to do this to you

01:09:06.902 --> 01:09:09.402
No one that comes to mind

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:12.374
Nobody I can think of

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:15.578
Especially I was thinking this for her

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:18.154
Okay

01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:20.096
Jay, we hear that you were close

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.962
with your principal Ms. Williams

01:09:21.987 --> 01:09:24.437
is that correct?

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.800
Yeah

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:32.229
Ever since my mother died

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.984
she played a big role in my life

01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:39.978
Damn man, a she didn't deserve this

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:44.459
She didn't deserve this man

01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:59.480
Do you think these things are connected?

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:02.277
We just gathered some information

01:10:02.302 --> 01:10:04.089
so we could do our job

01:10:04.114 --> 01:10:07.714
Our top priority is keeping
 the people in this building safe

01:10:07.739 --> 01:10:11.379
Anything, any information could help

01:10:12.114 --> 01:10:13.664
Erica

01:10:13.698 --> 01:10:14.932
we were told that Sarah was one

01:10:14.957 --> 01:10:17.807
of your closest friends, is that correct?

01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:19.832
Yes

01:10:21.673 --> 01:10:24.803
She is one of my best friends

01:10:26.609 --> 01:10:29.349
Did you know about her pregnancy?

01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:32.428
What?

01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:36.589
I'm sorry if that comes as a shock to you

01:10:37.342 --> 01:10:40.284
but would either one of you know

01:10:40.309 --> 01:10:42.029
but you know, might happen to be for

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.181
come on, we got to go

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:46.206
you have to understand

01:10:46.231 --> 01:10:48.681
this is a tough time for you

01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:50.512
But if anything comes, anything

01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:51.604
just give us a call

01:10:51.629 --> 01:10:53.289
We’d like to lock up sick person up

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:54.980
Stay safe in the meantime

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.295
will do the best we can

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.050
Hey Karma

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.920
Hi

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:31.961
We just wanted to say thank you

01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:34.031
again for being there

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:35.896
You’re welcome

01:11:36.112 --> 01:11:37.407
I know you guys probably

01:11:37.432 --> 01:11:40.242
would have done the same thing for me

01:11:41.282 --> 01:11:43.892
Okay, gonna catch up with you

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.511
Okay

01:11:57.476 --> 01:11:59.256
So you saved me huh?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.140
Guess I did

01:12:04.526 --> 01:12:07.316
How did you know I was in a locked room?

01:12:07.734 --> 01:12:09.790
What does that matter Jay?

01:12:09.815 --> 01:12:12.395
You’re safe, right?

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.683
Because it does matter

01:12:15.954 --> 01:12:17.586
How did you know

01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:19.621
I was stuck in the locker room?

01:12:19.646 --> 01:12:22.686
with all that was going on all Karma

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.172
How about I tell you tonight?

01:12:28.197 --> 01:12:30.587

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:32.052
No

01:12:32.331 --> 01:12:35.211
I want you to stay away from here

01:12:35.579 --> 01:12:38.188
and stay the fuck away from Erica

01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:41.494
She’s weak Jay,

01:12:41.627 --> 01:12:42.711
I'm warning you

01:12:42.736 --> 01:12:45.226
She’s not good for you

01:12:58.113 --> 01:12:59.113

01:12:59.987 --> 01:13:01.579

01:13:24.244 --> 01:13:26.930
Maybe I can show you how

01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:48.875
Yo, that bitch is crazy

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.090
I told you

01:14:30.094 --> 01:14:30.822

This a cute baby, and then what happened?

01:15:00.866 --> 01:15:02.288
So why the fucking am I here?

01:15:02.313 --> 01:15:03.655
You sock me a lot of shit earlier

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.760
So,

Well, I figured since I have the house

01:17:03.767 --> 01:17:05.507
Thanks Ms. Susan

01:17:50.238 --> 01:17:52.078
Okay James, I'm very gonna need you

01:17:52.103 --> 01:17:53.933

01:17:54.056 --> 01:17:55.586
I'm giving you one last chance

01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:56.649

01:17:56.674 --> 01:17:57.884

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:09.489
Karma, this is some interesting writing

01:18:09.514 --> 01:18:11.994
I want to talk to you after class

01:18:55.507 --> 01:18:56.687
Karma

01:18:56.712 --> 01:18:57.837
Is there something you got

01:18:57.862 --> 01:19:00.122
to talk to me about?

01:19:03.227 --> 01:19:04.947
Hello, Karma

01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:07.149
Is there something you'd like to talk to me about?

01:19:07.174 --> 01:19:09.124
what do you?

01:19:09.988 --> 01:19:12.708
I just wanna talk to you, that's all

01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:15.711
I wanna know if there's anything
 bothering you

01:19:16.424 --> 01:19:20.424
You know you can always talk to me

01:19:32.932 --> 01:19:34.662
Jay

01:19:35.715 --> 01:19:37.617
what’s up sergeant?

01:19:37.825 --> 01:19:39.955
Do you know this guy?

01:19:43.193 --> 01:19:44.415
Well, he's missing

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.340
and no one knows where he is

01:19:46.477 --> 01:19:48.315
Do you know where we might find him?

01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:56.056
We wanted to question him about Sarah

01:19:56.081 --> 01:19:58.579
We’ve been told they may have anything

01:20:00.864 --> 01:20:02.001
that's why I was wrong

01:20:02.026 --> 01:20:04.906
but nothing he really knew

01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:07.776
we also remain friends though

01:20:08.263 --> 01:20:10.603
I don't think is responsible for this right?

01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:12.418
not accuse him yet,

01:20:12.651 --> 01:20:16.321
but we hear that they were still sneaking around together

01:20:16.787 --> 01:20:18.267
wait

01:20:19.342 --> 01:20:20.962
I don't think he may have a...

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:22.438
it's possible,

01:20:22.463 --> 01:20:23.571
but we won't be able to clear him

01:20:23.596 --> 01:20:25.496
until we found him

01:20:25.616 --> 01:20:28.136
and he might be able to help us out

01:20:30.501 --> 01:20:33.501
Look, I'll see you

01:20:34.215 --> 01:20:36.235
I'll let you know, alright?

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.634
See you later sergeant

01:20:38.782 --> 01:20:40.942
Okay Jay, happy big game

01:23:39.539 --> 01:23:40.527
