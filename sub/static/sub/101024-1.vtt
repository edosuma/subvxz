WEBVTT

02:04.892 --> 02:06.694
"...the last rains
came gently,

02:07.995 --> 02:11.329
"and they did not cut
the scarred earth.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.669
<i>"The plows crossed and
recrossed the rivulet marks.</i>

02:16.003 --> 02:19.071
<i>"The last rains
lifted the corn quickly</i>

02:19.073 --> 02:23.475
<i>"and scattered weed colonies and
grass along the sides of the roads</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:24.844
<i>"so that the gray country</i>

02:24.846 --> 02:26.812
<i>"and the dark red country
began to disappear..."</i>

02:37.625 --> 02:39.357
<i>You listened to
the sermon today?</i>

02:39.359 --> 02:40.527
Yes, sir.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.828
And?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.429
I don't know.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.398
I don't know?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.269
"I don't know," is not
much of an answer, boy.

02:50.972 --> 02:53.706
Ah, pulled in nap time.

02:53.708 --> 02:56.409
I don't care much
for the Reverend's rhetoric.

02:57.078 --> 02:58.978
In fact, I'm sure his papi,

02:58.980 --> 03:00.613
Reverend senior would be
rolling in his grave

03:00.615 --> 03:02.681
for some of the utterings
coming out of his mouth

03:02.683 --> 03:03.885
in the house of the Lord.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.986
But I think we both understand

03:06.988 --> 03:08.990
what he was
basically getting at.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.958
I think so.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.561
You see, Oscar,

03:16.563 --> 03:19.466
there comes a time when a
man's gotta step up, son.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.804
Not so much for himself,

03:24.806 --> 03:26.739
but for the betterment
of others.

03:26.741 --> 03:28.308
You understand what I mean?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.777
And when that time comes,

03:31.779 --> 03:35.515
we as men,
we have to be ready to oblige it.

03:56.771 --> 03:58.904
- It's a mighty fine meal, Jo.
- Thank you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.942
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, honey.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.714
Oscar, you're gonna
run this over to Loux?

04:08.716 --> 04:12.550
Josephine, do not be
giving away what's ours.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.487
Augustus, those children
won't eat otherwise.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.090
Take this to them
and hurry home.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.126
Yeah.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.361
Come over here, boy.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.429
Don't be lagging.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.567
I don't want you catching whatever
virus lingers in that house, all right?

04:29.070 --> 04:30.071
Yes, sir.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.621
It's open.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.126
- Hey, Oscar.
- Hey.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.696
Hey, dove.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.131
What you got there?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.768
It's chop from my mum.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.571
- Loux, why don't you go crank up the stove?
- All right.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.142
- Take your brother in there.
- Amos.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.181
Boy.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.120
Did you not hear me? Get your ass
in there and help your sister.

05:22.857 --> 05:23.989
- Get your ass in there!
- Hey!

05:27.929 --> 05:29.096
Huh?

05:34.101 --> 05:37.104
Hey! You're a daft
little fucker, ain't you?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.518
Oscar.

05:53.688 --> 05:54.689
Come here, boy.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.894
Why don't you do something
for me now?

06:01.896 --> 06:05.197
I want you to tell that daddy of
yours I don't need his givings.

06:05.199 --> 06:09.101
I don't need his nor your
mom's backhanded charity.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.204
You understand me?

06:12.273 --> 06:15.174
Loux, cut the stove off,
give the feast back to Oscar.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.178
- But, Dad...
- Just do it, baby.

06:17.712 --> 06:19.645
You heard me.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.080
But...

06:21.082 --> 06:22.083
Do what I say.

06:33.728 --> 06:34.795
Here, take it back.

06:37.031 --> 06:38.132
Get the fuck out of my house.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.604
Go!

07:42.897 --> 07:44.165
Loux?

07:46.067 --> 07:47.068
Loux!

07:47.868 --> 07:48.869
Amos?

08:24.105 --> 08:25.906
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.111
What happened?

08:32.046 --> 08:33.047
Come sit with me.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.384
Get in there.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.653
Mmm.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.764
You know
I love you, right?

08:54.235 --> 08:56.170
- Will you love me?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.343
No one will ever hurt you.

09:05.146 --> 09:07.314
You getting to be real pretty,
you know that?

09:09.083 --> 09:10.918
I didn't notice
how much you've grown up.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.927
I couldn't stop him.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.963
You have to
do something.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.865
What do you mean?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.368
There's nowhere else
for us to go.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.770
You could live
out here.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.108
No one telling you what to do.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.415
Can you hear them?

09:43.184 --> 09:44.185
They're in the wind.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.156
Their screams.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.159
They were here long before us.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.863
And they will be forever.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.736
It's okay.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.903
It's okay.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.618
<i>I have been wanting
to give you this.</i>

14:12.620 --> 14:15.522
It was my mom's.
My dad won't let me wear it.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.291
I want you to have it.

14:19.627 --> 14:20.628
Let me help you.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.071
Got another minor, Keryn.

15:06.641 --> 15:09.009
Look at you.
You're just a baby.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.613
We're short-staffed tonight.

15:14.782 --> 15:16.450
That's fine.
I'll take him to Six.

15:16.885 --> 15:18.283
Come on, boy.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.634
I got another one for you.

16:09.771 --> 16:11.405
Is that the boy
who came in last night?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.712
Does that kid look like
a murderer to you, Keryn?

16:18.613 --> 16:21.246
No, he doesn't.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.616
Says this one's from
out near the marsh too.

16:23.618 --> 16:27.387
How is a kid gonna get
a hundred miles away overnight?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.856
Think he's got accomplices?

16:30.858 --> 16:33.458
You think
there's a conspiracy here?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.427
I don't know.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.562
They're all starting to look
the same to me.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.766
I'll leave you to it.

16:49.711 --> 16:51.144
Boy.

16:54.548 --> 16:55.683
Go on.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.769
"Oscar,

17:49.771 --> 17:53.340
"Clean up after yourself and put the milk
delivery away. We'll see you tonight.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.208
"Love, Mom."

17:57.979 --> 17:59.379
I'm Peaches.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.483
You hungry?

18:05.252 --> 18:06.253
Go ahead.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.627
Come on.

18:14.629 --> 18:16.664
Don't worry. Come on.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.443
Where are your parents?

18:31.445 --> 18:34.314
My mom died when I was three.
I never knew my father.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.420
I have a place to live,
people who look out for me.

18:48.930 --> 18:51.431
Now, the real question is
where do you live?

19:10.084 --> 19:11.284
Watch your step.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.531
After you.

19:41.115 --> 19:43.350
Well, look who it is.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.085
Took her forever to get back.

19:46.087 --> 19:47.622
Thought she tried to
run away again like last time.

19:48.956 --> 19:52.590
Fellas, this is Oscar.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.029
Oscar, this is my family
of broken toys.

20:10.077 --> 20:11.078
Sway?

20:12.880 --> 20:13.881
Sway!

20:15.783 --> 20:16.784
Come in.

20:23.090 --> 20:26.424
No. No. No!

20:26.426 --> 20:28.127
No room for him.

20:28.129 --> 20:29.862
Sway, come on.
He's got nowhere to go.

20:29.864 --> 20:30.865
Said no.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.399
God, will you please
just take a look?

20:34.401 --> 20:35.601
I found him
outside the station.

20:35.603 --> 20:37.104
Quit being so fucking lazy.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.107
Oh, listen to the lady.

20:43.811 --> 20:45.713
Now let me have a look at you.

20:49.183 --> 20:52.117
I'm gentle as a lamb's ear.

20:57.158 --> 20:58.491
His name is Oscar.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.428
Ah, I see.

21:03.931 --> 21:06.366
Do you know
what your name means, boy?

21:07.668 --> 21:08.834
No.

21:08.836 --> 21:11.003
Oscar, uh,

21:11.005 --> 21:14.840
divine spear,
champion warrior.

21:22.683 --> 21:24.517
You are a champion,
aren't you?

21:25.653 --> 21:27.086
Huh?

21:27.088 --> 21:29.389
Noble.

21:31.926 --> 21:36.030
You've made decisions only a
man should make, not a boy.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.402
Should be a natural.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.082
Billy.

22:01.022 --> 22:04.589
Uh... I know, I know.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.093
You know
what, Neville?

22:06.861 --> 22:07.929
Not to come here.

22:09.664 --> 22:11.096
But I do understand, you know,

22:11.098 --> 22:14.902
you liking the ambience
and all, so...

22:16.203 --> 22:17.972
- Neville.
- What?

22:20.174 --> 22:22.710
Right. Well, it's about
the new boy.

22:23.911 --> 22:25.010
All right.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.014
Well, you just
bring him by the office.

22:28.783 --> 22:29.917
He has family.

22:31.285 --> 22:33.052
He ain't told me
where he's from,

22:33.054 --> 22:34.121
but he's not from the city.

22:34.956 --> 22:37.156
So... You know,

22:37.158 --> 22:40.025
I mean, I was thinking that
we don't have the room.

22:40.027 --> 22:45.698
You see, this is why I leave
the selection process to Flan.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.568
If this was your show,
we'd be running a goddamn petting zoo.

22:49.270 --> 22:51.170
I was just thinking that...

22:51.172 --> 22:52.771
Well, don't be
thinking, Neville.

22:52.773 --> 22:54.642
It ain't what
you do good, okay?

22:59.213 --> 23:01.749
Look... Do you want to
meet him?

23:06.854 --> 23:08.287
- You brought him here?
- Yeah, I did.

23:08.289 --> 23:10.189
Oh, Jesus Christ.

23:10.191 --> 23:11.589
What? I just...

23:11.591 --> 23:13.792
Well...

23:13.794 --> 23:16.097
All right, look,
I'll go get him.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.605
Come here, come here.
Come on.

23:34.782 --> 23:36.148
They treatin' you
all right?

23:36.150 --> 23:38.585
- Go ahead, answer him.
- Yes, sir.

23:41.989 --> 23:43.057
Good.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.358
You just keep your eyes open.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.962
Maybe you'll learn
a thing or two.

23:51.132 --> 23:53.132
Okay, all right. Okay.

23:53.134 --> 23:54.135
Go on out.

23:59.273 --> 24:02.109
I like him. Oh, he stays.

24:03.878 --> 24:05.212
Goddamnit.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.052
Goddamnit!

24:14.188 --> 24:15.555
How's the ticker, Neville?

24:18.826 --> 24:20.227
Running like a Swiss watch.

24:25.866 --> 24:26.867
Billy.

24:46.887 --> 24:49.356
Go! You know what to do.

24:54.261 --> 24:55.327
And you?

25:00.968 --> 25:03.671
<i>So what we provide here
is an education.</i>

25:05.072 --> 25:06.373
A way of life.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.111
Fit only for wolves.

25:11.278 --> 25:14.413
Sir...

25:14.415 --> 25:16.782
Oh, yeah, down there and...

25:16.784 --> 25:20.385
<i>And me, I'm the
headmaster, or the conductor.</i>

25:20.387 --> 25:21.822
Bloop!

25:24.058 --> 25:25.092
Look around.

25:25.926 --> 25:27.025
What do you see?

25:30.097 --> 25:31.732
<i>Simple-minded people.</i>

25:33.701 --> 25:34.902
<i>Cogs in the wheel.</i>

25:36.770 --> 25:40.105
Television, magazines,
billboards.

25:40.107 --> 25:41.242
Other people's dreams.

25:43.878 --> 25:48.881
<i>They've been told how to look,
think, feel.</i>

25:48.883 --> 25:51.018
<i>They've never had
an original thought.</i>

25:54.455 --> 25:56.423
You know what separates us
from them?

25:59.460 --> 26:01.929
<i>The gift of desperation.</i>

26:23.350 --> 26:25.719
Cotton, count the money.
Lollie, the stone.

26:27.922 --> 26:31.725
So... you think
you got this in you?

26:34.061 --> 26:35.296
I think he does.

26:36.797 --> 26:38.699
Did anyone ask you?

26:41.402 --> 26:43.035
What you got here?

26:43.037 --> 26:44.269
Two hundred
and seventeen dollars.

26:44.271 --> 26:47.339
Two hundred and seventeen dollars.
Thank you very much.

26:51.779 --> 26:53.214
Oh. Give me a minute.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.050
What you got?

26:58.052 --> 26:59.053
Something you should see.

27:02.089 --> 27:05.259
Oh. That's...

27:07.361 --> 27:08.896
very unfortunate.

27:18.372 --> 27:19.473
What are you
gonna do about it?

27:21.809 --> 27:22.943
Make it disappear.

27:24.845 --> 27:26.311
That might not be so easy.

27:26.313 --> 27:28.382
People might be coming
after him.

27:30.351 --> 27:31.885
Just do your fucking job.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.221
Oh. Oh.

27:35.356 --> 27:37.324
Prick.
Fucking prick.

28:06.553 --> 28:07.554
Come on.

28:49.631 --> 28:51.332
- You go there.
- Okay.

29:12.386 --> 29:13.454
Hey, find anything?

29:13.987 --> 29:15.055
No.

29:42.617 --> 29:43.618
Shit. Come on, let's go.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.210
Go, go, go, they're coming.

30:18.552 --> 30:19.920
Here you go, princess.

30:35.202 --> 30:36.203
Thank you.

30:36.570 --> 30:37.639
Keep it.

30:39.072 --> 30:41.141
- What flavor did you get?
- Bubblegum.

30:42.209 --> 30:43.375
Oh, wait.
Do you want anything?

30:43.377 --> 30:46.313
No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good.
You just enjoy yourself.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.685
Bubblegum.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.589
How's new boy working out?

30:56.791 --> 30:58.959
He's all right. Learning.

31:02.095 --> 31:04.198
He like you, you like him
kinda thing?

31:05.098 --> 31:06.166
I wouldn't say that.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.137
Well, that's good.
I like that.

31:11.806 --> 31:13.173
You gotta be a little careful.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.211
Careful how?

31:18.479 --> 31:19.480
Well...

31:22.282 --> 31:25.720
You know, you and me,
we ain't that different.

31:27.588 --> 31:28.656
I come up in this.

31:30.123 --> 31:31.425
- You did?
- Yep.

31:32.660 --> 31:34.694
Me and Sway.

31:34.696 --> 31:36.330
I was about your age
when I met him.

31:38.198 --> 31:39.366
What was he like back then?

31:41.736 --> 31:44.302
Kinda like he is now,

31:44.304 --> 31:47.472
except, little bit more run
down, if you can believe that.

31:51.646 --> 31:54.314
Yeah, he's got the same problem
now as he had when I met him.

31:56.483 --> 31:58.720
- And what's that?
- His heart's too big.

32:04.692 --> 32:06.728
You gotta be careful
who you trust in this life.

32:08.495 --> 32:09.731
You see what I'm saying,
don't you?

32:13.267 --> 32:14.368
I think so.

32:16.638 --> 32:18.305
You know why I am
the way I am?

32:24.177 --> 32:25.279
'Cause I wanted more.

32:27.649 --> 32:29.784
And I wasn't gonna ask for it.
I just took it.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.322
You know,
most people in this life,

32:37.391 --> 32:39.426
they spend their whole lives
working for somebody else.

32:42.764 --> 32:44.797
You don't wanna
get stepped on,

32:44.799 --> 32:46.533
sometimes you gotta
take this out of it.

32:48.903 --> 32:51.303
You gotta just grab
what you want.

32:51.305 --> 32:52.439
Ain't nobody
gonna give it to you.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.576
You understand
what I'm saying?

32:58.211 --> 32:59.212
Yeah, I do.

33:01.616 --> 33:02.684
Smart girl.

33:13.527 --> 33:15.395
- There you go.
- Thank you.

33:27.407 --> 33:28.408
I like this.

33:29.576 --> 33:30.577
Oh, you do?

33:32.479 --> 33:35.681
Well, I mean,
what's not to like?

33:35.683 --> 33:38.620
We have everything we need,
we do whatever we want.

33:42.624 --> 33:44.157
Do you ever miss your family?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.261
My family didn't want me.

33:49.631 --> 33:51.329
And I don't want them.

33:51.331 --> 33:53.635
Besides, now we have
each other.

33:57.337 --> 33:58.638
Yeah.

34:01.408 --> 34:02.442
You miss them, don't you?

34:04.846 --> 34:08.480
Look, you did
the right thing, okay?

34:08.482 --> 34:10.217
And if they knew the truth,
they would think so too.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.186
- And that girl...
- Loux.

34:13.587 --> 34:14.588
Loux.

34:16.256 --> 34:17.659
She won't ever forget
what you did for her.

34:24.666 --> 34:25.900
Do you believe in fate, Oscar?

34:27.567 --> 34:29.534
I don't know. What's that?

34:29.536 --> 34:32.205
It's like...

34:34.709 --> 34:36.543
Everything happens
the way it's supposed to.

34:37.745 --> 34:38.880
Bad and good.

34:40.547 --> 34:41.616
I think so.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.551
Okay, well, I do.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.622
And...

34:49.423 --> 34:52.459
I believe that someday
Loux will find you.

34:54.696 --> 34:55.697
Really?

34:56.931 --> 34:57.932
Yeah.

34:59.901 --> 35:02.737
But, for now, you have me.

35:05.338 --> 35:08.508
And I believe that
something brought us together.

35:10.377 --> 35:12.780
We just have to
stick together, okay?

35:14.816 --> 35:15.817
Yes.

35:17.551 --> 35:19.352
Now there's just
one more thing.

35:28.663 --> 35:30.665
See? That wasn't
so bad, right?

35:32.700 --> 35:33.701
Yeah.

35:38.673 --> 35:40.507
I think I'm gonna call you
"O" from now on.

35:41.943 --> 35:42.944
Is that okay?

35:44.444 --> 35:45.445
Yeah.

35:48.582 --> 35:50.885
You won't disappear on me,
right, O?

35:52.452 --> 35:53.453
Never.

35:53.955 --> 35:54.956
Promise me.

35:56.356 --> 35:57.457
I promise.

35:58.793 --> 36:00.092
Good.

36:09.103 --> 36:10.570
How'd you do
at the track today?

36:12.073 --> 36:13.639
Not good.

36:13.641 --> 36:15.542
Told you, Bird.

36:16.144 --> 36:17.779
Can't trust a white stain.

36:21.716 --> 36:24.018
- Uh, let me get you another.
- I'm fine.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.091
Nice of you to show up
a half hour late

36:32.093 --> 36:33.694
and leave me alone
with this cocksucker.

36:35.630 --> 36:36.631
Congressman.

36:45.940 --> 36:46.941
There's a problem.

36:49.811 --> 36:52.312
Come to think of it,
maybe I will take that drink.

36:54.916 --> 36:55.917
Sure.

36:59.921 --> 37:01.022
Don't forget the twist.

37:05.927 --> 37:07.360
Kid made quite a mess.

37:10.865 --> 37:11.933
Sure did.

37:14.001 --> 37:16.336
Sway seems to think
we should cut him loose.

37:19.974 --> 37:21.341
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

37:29.684 --> 37:30.685
What is this place?

37:31.185 --> 37:32.385
You'll see.

37:34.822 --> 37:37.058
You ever think about
just getting up and going?

37:37.859 --> 37:40.159
Maybe Kansas City.

37:40.161 --> 37:42.697
You've ever had barbecue from Kansas City?
It's the best!

37:43.463 --> 37:45.633
Huh? Cherry pie.

37:47.068 --> 37:48.767
Huh? Huh?

37:48.769 --> 37:49.770
I don't know.

37:56.010 --> 37:58.145
You're in love, ain't you?

37:58.946 --> 37:59.947
Yeah.

38:01.481 --> 38:02.582
Wow.

38:03.951 --> 38:06.486
Young love. Ain't nothing
better than that.

38:08.555 --> 38:10.024
Ain't nothing worse either.

38:10.423 --> 38:11.659
It can kill you.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.394
Yeah, that's true.

38:15.963 --> 38:18.766
Oh, boy!

38:38.653 --> 38:40.021
Okay, come on.

38:42.223 --> 38:43.689
It's all about
balance, okay?

38:43.691 --> 38:46.892
Take this thing and put it right
here, in the crook of your shoulder.

38:46.894 --> 38:48.027
Okay.

38:48.029 --> 38:49.030
Hold it like that.

38:50.932 --> 38:52.199
- You try it.
- Okay.

38:53.968 --> 38:55.703
You got to make sure
you hold it steady now.

38:58.239 --> 38:59.572
Good girl.

39:01.042 --> 39:02.076
Looks good.

39:05.980 --> 39:06.981
Hey, Bird.

39:08.883 --> 39:12.084
Sway, Birdie's teaching me
how to go hog hunting.

39:12.086 --> 39:13.285
Oh.

39:13.287 --> 39:16.121
Uh, that's nice, sweetie.

39:16.123 --> 39:17.756
Why don't you just
point it right at his belly?

39:17.758 --> 39:20.025
It's kinda the same size
as the hog.

39:23.064 --> 39:24.531
Hmm.

39:27.702 --> 39:29.603
Peaches here tells me
you're a quick learner.

39:31.205 --> 39:33.040
That's right,
he is, right?

39:34.208 --> 39:35.607
Yeah.

39:35.609 --> 39:36.644
Well, that's good.

39:39.579 --> 39:42.149
Man, you got a shitload
of people after you.

39:44.218 --> 39:45.219
Police.

39:49.690 --> 39:50.725
It says here...

39:52.927 --> 39:53.995
you killed a man.

39:56.764 --> 39:59.665
And I'm sure
you had your reasons,

39:59.667 --> 40:04.138
but... I mean, do you wanna go
back and face a mess like that?

40:07.241 --> 40:08.909
I can make
this whole thing go away.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.647
I think you'd do
real good here with us.

40:16.117 --> 40:18.085
You understand
what he's saying to you, son?

40:21.155 --> 40:22.656
Yes.

40:25.126 --> 40:26.227
You're a smart boy.

40:27.995 --> 40:30.162
All right.

40:30.164 --> 40:31.598
Why don't you
give us a minute?

40:33.167 --> 40:34.201
Uh, what?

40:34.835 --> 40:35.836
Oh.

40:37.004 --> 40:38.039
Neville, you stay.

40:48.149 --> 40:50.084
What's up?

40:53.354 --> 40:55.289
How many years
we go back, Neville?

40:58.926 --> 41:01.729
You've always been a champion
of the work that we do here.

41:03.130 --> 41:05.697
You know?

41:05.699 --> 41:08.769
- I just can't have you deviating from the job.
- What are you talking about?

41:09.203 --> 41:10.836
That boy.

41:10.838 --> 41:14.773
You got your reservations about whether
he should stay or whether he should go.

41:14.775 --> 41:18.179
What are you talking about?
'Cause I've given you no cause...

41:19.013 --> 41:20.245
Safety's next.

41:20.247 --> 41:22.681
Make sure the safety is off.
That's this thing right here.

41:22.683 --> 41:23.918
- Okay.
- Atta girl.

41:24.852 --> 41:25.953
Yeah, uh...

41:26.921 --> 41:28.289
Just quit playing, all right?

41:31.425 --> 41:33.127
And when you feel like
you got a hog in your sights,

41:34.428 --> 41:35.963
you just pull that trigger.

41:54.315 --> 41:56.083
Oscar, I didn't know
the gun was loaded.

41:58.185 --> 42:00.252
I didn't... I didn't know
the gun was loaded, okay?

42:00.254 --> 42:01.755
I didn't fucking know!

42:02.456 --> 42:04.022
It's okay, Peaches.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.958
It's okay.

42:05.960 --> 42:06.994
Go get her, son.

42:18.005 --> 42:19.373
Hey, Oscar, look at me.
Look at me.

42:21.909 --> 42:24.678
It's okay.
These things happen.

42:25.746 --> 42:26.747
All right?

42:33.154 --> 42:34.987
All right,
get him out of here,

42:34.989 --> 42:36.690
and run back
and clean this shit up.

42:37.491 --> 42:38.692
You know I will.

43:47.361 --> 43:48.395
Thank you.

43:56.237 --> 43:57.504
Excuse me?

44:00.040 --> 44:02.908
I'm Lester. Rineau Private Eye.
What can I do for you?

44:02.910 --> 44:05.279
I'm here for the interview.
We spoke on the phone.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.980
Oh, yeah.

44:07.982 --> 44:09.581
Well, come on in. Have a seat.

44:09.583 --> 44:11.452
Sorry about the mess.

44:13.887 --> 44:15.587
So, uh,

44:15.589 --> 44:20.025
you have any experience
in the detective field?

44:20.027 --> 44:23.264
No, sir, I don't. I thought
the ad was for a secretary?

44:24.598 --> 44:27.866
Of... Of course, yeah.

44:27.868 --> 44:29.903
Uh, well, tell me
a little bit about yourself.

44:30.771 --> 44:33.405
Well, I just moved here
a few weeks ago.

44:33.407 --> 44:35.507
I have mostly
worked at restaurants,

44:35.509 --> 44:38.410
but the last diner I was at
went out of business,

44:38.412 --> 44:40.881
so I thought I would try
something new.

44:42.149 --> 44:44.018
Um, but I'm
a really quick learner.

44:45.519 --> 44:48.088
I just need somebody
to be punctual, present,

44:48.922 --> 44:49.990
answer the phone.

44:50.991 --> 44:55.193
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes. Yeah, I can.

44:55.195 --> 44:58.964
Great. Then I'll see you
tomorrow at 8:00.

44:58.966 --> 45:01.634
Oh, okay. Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow at 8:00.

45:01.636 --> 45:03.237
Uh, thank you so much.

45:23.324 --> 45:24.890
Uh, excuse me, sir, uh...

45:24.892 --> 45:27.492
Do you know where
South Main Street is?

45:27.494 --> 45:29.361
South Main Street is this way.

45:29.363 --> 45:30.864
- Okay... wallet.
- Whoa!

45:31.932 --> 45:34.168
- Okay... All right. All right.
- Hurry up!

45:35.369 --> 45:36.769
I'm gonna get to that.
One second.

45:36.771 --> 45:39.973
I just got all this stuff in my pockets and...

45:41.575 --> 45:43.143
The fuck is wrong with you?

45:48.349 --> 45:49.416
Take your weapon.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.319
Who could tell me
what they did wrong?

45:54.321 --> 45:56.388
- Suckers!
- They came too close.

45:58.592 --> 46:00.994
Look, let me show you how it's done.
Give me the gun.

46:03.364 --> 46:04.498
Come on.

46:05.199 --> 46:06.531
Point it at me.

46:06.533 --> 46:09.503
Things are not moving fast
enough, then you cock it. Cock it.

46:12.373 --> 46:14.272
If he don't move after that,

46:14.274 --> 46:15.608
that's when you have
a real problem.

46:15.610 --> 46:17.509
That's when... That's when
you get in his face.

46:17.511 --> 46:19.012
That's when you put
the heat on him.

46:20.214 --> 46:21.348
Show him that you're crazy.

46:22.583 --> 46:25.417
Look, there is an art to this.

46:25.419 --> 46:27.287
I don't want anything
to happen to you kids.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.555
Focus, guys, come on.

46:30.557 --> 46:33.959
- Eyes open all the time, even when they're closed.
- Yes, sir.

46:33.961 --> 46:35.527
All right, let's get something
to eat. Come on.

46:35.529 --> 46:36.561
Oh, yeah!

46:36.563 --> 46:39.030
I like the way you think.

47:09.296 --> 47:10.595
I need for you
to get there early,

47:10.597 --> 47:12.030
get their money orders.

47:12.032 --> 47:14.201
They usually come pick 'em up
before noon.

47:19.607 --> 47:22.307
I know you don't like
this job, son.

47:22.309 --> 47:23.944
It's probably the last time
we're gonna do it.

47:25.279 --> 47:28.013
But we gotta keep the
checkbooks balanced, don't we?

47:28.015 --> 47:29.349
You pickin' up
what I'm putting down?

47:32.620 --> 47:35.489
I'm pickin' it up, Bird,
but I don't think it's a good idea.

47:37.090 --> 47:38.658
We're not ready.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

47:38.660 --> 47:40.294
We got lucky the first time.

47:42.797 --> 47:44.465
You don't think
I'm asking you, do you?

47:50.103 --> 47:51.104
We'll get it done.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.241
Good.

48:07.554 --> 48:10.557
But what in the fuck do you
think is going on with Peaches?

48:12.259 --> 48:14.092
What do you mean?

48:14.094 --> 48:15.828
It's just... She don't...
She don't seem to

48:15.830 --> 48:17.630
wanna do nothing
as a group anymore.

48:17.632 --> 48:19.364
She just wants to go off
on her own,

48:19.366 --> 48:22.169
she keeps bugging me
about her end of the money.

48:22.904 --> 48:25.038
- She said that?
- She said that.

48:26.641 --> 48:28.175
You ain't noticed this shit?

48:30.477 --> 48:31.478
I don't know, Bird.

48:33.213 --> 48:35.380
Fuckin' women, man.

48:35.382 --> 48:38.684
Get to be a certain age,
they start getting all desperate and shit,

48:38.686 --> 48:40.420
they start making
stupid choices.

48:44.157 --> 48:45.158
Do me a favor.

48:46.193 --> 48:47.427
Keep a close eye on her,
will you?

48:50.632 --> 48:51.633
Okay.

48:54.535 --> 48:56.036
All right. Thanks, O.

48:59.573 --> 49:00.574
Hey, O.

49:02.409 --> 49:03.745
You know
you're my right hand, right?

49:05.479 --> 49:07.546
You know there ain't nobody
I trust like you.

49:07.548 --> 49:09.349
Without you,
this whole thing goes away.

49:13.587 --> 49:14.622
I hear you, Bird.

49:16.356 --> 49:17.357
All right.

49:22.195 --> 49:23.230
Peaches.

49:30.270 --> 49:31.405
The fuck is up with him?

49:32.172 --> 49:33.173
What do you mean?

49:33.908 --> 49:35.775
I don't know.

49:35.777 --> 49:37.411
He seems kinda distant, right?

49:39.479 --> 49:42.581
He's probably just lost
in one of his stupid books.

49:42.583 --> 49:44.382
No, no, it ain't that.

49:44.384 --> 49:47.687
Just like, he wants to do
everything on his own.

49:47.689 --> 49:49.456
He don't wanna be part
of the group no more.

49:52.593 --> 49:53.761
You know, men...

49:55.763 --> 49:57.228
They get to be a certain age,

49:57.230 --> 49:58.700
they get delusions
of grandeur.

50:00.267 --> 50:02.469
They wanna run everything
by themselves.

50:06.941 --> 50:08.442
Keep an eye on him for me?

50:10.712 --> 50:12.145
Of course, I will.

50:13.815 --> 50:14.849
That's my girl.

50:19.654 --> 50:21.623
You know you're
my right hand man, right?

50:23.357 --> 50:25.459
You're the only one
around here I can trust.

50:27.729 --> 50:28.796
I know, daddy-o.

50:29.529 --> 50:30.530
Fine.

50:53.721 --> 50:55.253
What are you reading?

50:55.255 --> 50:56.256
<i>Rumble Fish.</i>

50:57.557 --> 50:58.626
Who is it by?

50:59.827 --> 51:02.394
- It's S.E. Hinton.
- S.E. Hinton?

51:02.396 --> 51:03.765
Yeah, S.E. Hinton.

51:04.564 --> 51:06.264
Is he good?

51:06.266 --> 51:08.801
It's a...
It's a she, not a he.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.272
Sounds like a boy's name.

51:14.274 --> 51:16.374
- I think that's the point.
- What do you mean?

51:16.376 --> 51:18.646
I think she wanted people
to think she was a boy.

51:20.648 --> 51:22.182
Well, why would she want that?

51:23.651 --> 51:25.753
So they would take her
more seriously.

51:26.788 --> 51:27.789
Hey!

51:49.911 --> 51:50.945
Kiss me.

52:41.863 --> 52:45.898
Do you ever think about,
like, just leaving this place, like,

52:45.900 --> 52:48.466
to do something
on our own?

52:48.468 --> 52:49.604
What are you saying?

52:50.938 --> 52:52.372
I'm saying, have you ever
thought about it?

52:54.876 --> 52:56.510
You said you won't
disappear on me.

52:57.945 --> 53:00.478
I'm not going to
disappear on you.

53:00.480 --> 53:02.482
How many times
do you want me to say it?

53:05.552 --> 53:06.553
What?

53:07.487 --> 53:08.488
Nothing.

54:03.945 --> 54:05.746
- Hi, good morning.
- Morning.

54:08.582 --> 54:10.417
What the fuck
did you do?

54:11.451 --> 54:12.450
You weren't here.

54:12.452 --> 54:14.086
I figured I'd fix
the place up a little bit.

54:14.088 --> 54:15.122
Wha...

54:17.024 --> 54:18.657
Is something wrong?

54:18.659 --> 54:21.492
I had everything
exactly the way I wanted it.

54:21.494 --> 54:23.030
Nobody touches this desk!

54:28.202 --> 54:31.704
Look, why don't you just...

54:31.706 --> 54:34.675
go home for the rest of the day?
Just go.

54:37.577 --> 54:40.615
- Go!
- Okay, I'm, I'm really sorry.

54:53.526 --> 54:56.128
Now, don't anyone forget
anything, all right?

54:56.130 --> 54:58.563
- All right.
- Lost Boys.

54:58.565 --> 55:00.567
- Till the end. Till the end.
- Till the end.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.440
Get down!

55:07.975 --> 55:09.141
Get down on the floor.

55:09.143 --> 55:10.910
Surprise,
motherfucker!

55:10.912 --> 55:12.747
Get your ass on the ground.
You hear?

55:14.148 --> 55:17.652
Don't fucking move!

55:18.953 --> 55:20.021
Stay fucking down.

55:22.823 --> 55:25.224
Everyone down
on the fucking ground.

55:25.226 --> 55:26.859
Okay,
let's fucking go.

55:26.861 --> 55:28.493
Let's fucking go. Come on!

55:28.495 --> 55:31.997
Get down right now!
Hurry the fuck up!

55:33.167 --> 55:37.136
Okay, that's just so that
you know this is a real gun,

55:37.138 --> 55:38.704
that it's loaded

55:38.706 --> 55:40.839
and that we are not
fucking around.

55:40.841 --> 55:42.708
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move, move.

55:42.710 --> 55:44.509
Get your fucking asses
over there.

55:44.511 --> 55:46.747
All right, you've seen this
on TV.

55:47.615 --> 55:49.014
You know the drill.

55:49.016 --> 55:51.719
Lie down. Lie the fuck down
on your stomach.

55:52.219 --> 55:53.520
Palms down.

55:54.689 --> 55:55.921
Right, Lost Boys?

55:55.923 --> 55:57.490
Yeah!

55:59.293 --> 56:00.893
Where's the fucking manager?

56:00.895 --> 56:02.562
No one fucking moves,
all right?

56:03.530 --> 56:04.899
If somebody fucking moves,

56:06.200 --> 56:07.234
fucking shoot 'em.

56:10.237 --> 56:12.604
Miho, chill, I got you, bro.

56:12.606 --> 56:16.675
You're not messing with me right now.
Do you know what key it is?

56:16.677 --> 56:18.145
All right, open it.
Come on, open it.

56:20.281 --> 56:21.615
Goddamn!

56:26.220 --> 56:28.588
Oh, shit!

56:29.790 --> 56:31.556
Shit.

56:31.558 --> 56:32.658
Oh, God.

56:35.763 --> 56:38.833
Come with me. Come with me.
Come with me.

56:40.234 --> 56:42.134
- The fuck happened?
- Oh, God.

56:42.136 --> 56:43.869
Lay down. Lay down.

56:43.871 --> 56:45.871
What the fuck?

56:45.873 --> 56:47.675
All right, Lost Boys,
out, out!

56:54.982 --> 56:56.715
Hey, hey.

56:56.717 --> 56:57.883
Apply pressure on there.

57:33.154 --> 57:34.620
Hey, y'all,
watch this.

57:34.622 --> 57:36.255
All right. Who's Pockets?
Who's Pockets?

57:41.395 --> 57:44.863
Oh, hell no. Hell no.
This tastes like shit, bro.

57:44.865 --> 57:46.967
- I told you. I told you.
- Hey!

57:59.146 --> 58:01.215
- What is this?
- It's your shit. Get out of here.

58:01.982 --> 58:03.217
Go. Get out of here.

58:03.484 --> 58:04.416
Line up.

58:04.418 --> 58:05.350
Hey, what the fuck
are you talking about?

58:05.352 --> 58:07.920
You don't wanna be here,
so get out of here.

58:07.922 --> 58:09.657
You don't respect this family,
so leave.

58:10.224 --> 58:11.591
I don't wanna leave.

58:13.060 --> 58:16.728
Are you kidding me?
You know what happened today?

58:16.730 --> 58:18.132
Do you know that
someone got shot?

58:19.366 --> 58:21.433
I'm gonna go.

58:21.435 --> 58:24.002
I'm sorry, but,
he shouldn't have been fucking with me.

58:24.004 --> 58:25.339
He got what he deserved.

58:25.906 --> 58:27.308
That man deserved that?

58:28.943 --> 58:30.344
You think that's what
I'm teaching you?

58:32.379 --> 58:34.849
- Oh, look...
- Look... Am I talking to you?

58:39.086 --> 58:41.153
Do you know what that world
thinks of you?

58:41.155 --> 58:45.824
They think you're black,
white trash, garbage.

58:45.826 --> 58:47.027
You know what I think of you?

58:48.796 --> 58:50.762
I think everyone here is gold.

58:50.764 --> 58:53.432
Everyone here has value.

58:53.434 --> 58:56.735
You're worth something.
You're a part of something.

58:56.737 --> 58:57.805
You don't respect that?

59:01.175 --> 59:03.408
There you go.

59:03.410 --> 59:05.846
There's a cold world
just waiting for you, kid.

59:15.289 --> 59:17.222
Whoa! Dude, just chill.

59:17.224 --> 59:19.093
- Oh, come on, man.
- Don't tell me to chill.

59:24.365 --> 59:26.098
- What the fuck man?
- Jesus Christ!

59:26.100 --> 59:28.233
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, my God. Stop!

59:28.235 --> 59:30.369
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Relax. Get your hands off of me.

59:30.371 --> 59:31.537
Relax.

59:31.539 --> 59:32.973
- What the fuck are you doing, man?
- Stop.

59:33.474 --> 59:34.842
Oh, my God.

59:42.216 --> 59:44.116
In the morning,

59:44.118 --> 59:48.187
whoever has an "X" on their arm
is gonna be a part of this family.

59:48.189 --> 59:51.158
Everyone who doesn't
is a fucking stranger.

59:55.396 --> 59:57.298
You guys know how I feel
about strangers.

1:00:20.921 --> 1:00:22.356
- Lester?
- Quiet!

1:00:23.524 --> 1:00:24.758
I'm thinking.

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:33.767
What do you want?

1:00:35.469 --> 1:00:37.871
The name on this box, Carbone.

1:00:38.372 --> 1:00:39.406
Who is that?

1:00:41.041 --> 1:00:42.076
Why?

1:00:43.377 --> 1:00:45.244
I'm just curious. I mean...

1:00:45.246 --> 1:00:47.913
Everything else is labeled
missing persons or infidelities.

1:00:47.915 --> 1:00:50.451
That's the only one
with a name on it.

1:00:52.820 --> 1:00:54.820
I hired you
to answer the phone,

1:00:54.822 --> 1:00:56.957
not to be in here
asking questions.

1:01:00.928 --> 1:01:01.929
Sorry.

1:01:12.239 --> 1:01:15.342
My wife, Margaret,

1:01:17.111 --> 1:01:19.780
she had a theory
about the name on that box.

1:01:21.548 --> 1:01:22.916
She worked very hard on it.

1:01:27.955 --> 1:01:29.189
What was her theory?

1:01:32.559 --> 1:01:34.828
That there's no good
in this town anymore.

1:01:35.963 --> 1:01:37.097
Mmm.

1:01:39.133 --> 1:01:42.002
What, um, happened to her,
if you don't mind me asking?

1:01:44.138 --> 1:01:45.139
She died.

1:01:48.042 --> 1:01:49.176
I'm sorry.

1:01:50.477 --> 1:01:51.478
Do me a favor.

1:01:53.347 --> 1:01:55.516
Let the name
on that box die too.

1:01:58.085 --> 1:01:59.119
Okay.

1:02:01.656 --> 1:02:04.058
I'm gonna turn in early.

1:02:06.661 --> 1:02:09.463
- You make sure you lock up.
- Okay.

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:14.335
- All right, well, have a good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1:02:19.139 --> 1:02:20.908
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:02:54.975 --> 1:02:55.976
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:02:59.346 --> 1:03:01.480
Hi, where's
the Missing Persons?

1:03:01.482 --> 1:03:02.617
Uh, the woman
just behind there.

1:03:04.585 --> 1:03:06.954
I know. I'll get out of here
around 5:00.

1:03:08.389 --> 1:03:11.024
I'll be out front. Okay.

1:03:12.627 --> 1:03:13.860
Yes, can I help you?

1:03:13.862 --> 1:03:17.295
Hi, is there someone I can
talk to about a missing boy?

1:03:17.297 --> 1:03:21.466
- Have you filled out a report?
- No, I have not yet. I...

1:03:21.468 --> 1:03:24.304
Flan, this young lady wants to
fill a missing person's report.

1:03:27.474 --> 1:03:28.741
What's the name?

1:03:28.743 --> 1:03:32.645
Well, a report was already
filed about fifteen years ago.

1:03:32.647 --> 1:03:34.014
15 years ago?

1:03:36.283 --> 1:03:38.984
Honey, I've been doing this
a long time.

1:03:38.986 --> 1:03:42.020
After a few days,
things don't look good.

1:03:42.022 --> 1:03:44.556
Okay, well, is... I mean,
do you guys have any records,

1:03:44.558 --> 1:03:47.292
or what would you
suggest I do?

1:03:47.294 --> 1:03:51.229
- Is it family, a friend?
- It's an old friend.

1:03:51.231 --> 1:03:56.001
Why don't you come back
tomorrow and we'll talk more?

1:03:56.003 --> 1:03:58.470
- 9:00 work?
- Yeah, that would be great.

1:03:58.472 --> 1:03:59.705
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1:03:59.707 --> 1:04:02.474
- And what was your name?
- Jim. Jim Flannery.

1:04:02.476 --> 1:04:04.011
Jim Flannery.
Okay, thank you so much.

1:04:32.372 --> 1:04:34.609
Amos, look what I found.

1:04:35.610 --> 1:04:36.977
Give me one second.

1:04:38.412 --> 1:04:39.612
Okay.

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:40.615
What?

1:04:42.416 --> 1:04:43.417
Okay.

1:04:46.386 --> 1:04:48.553
Okay. Okay.

1:04:48.555 --> 1:04:51.626
- Does something make sense? I mean, I looked at it...
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:04:54.361 --> 1:04:59.732
Start here in Brady
Heights, 546, New Haven.

1:04:59.734 --> 1:05:02.768
Then Greenwood District, 808,
Rockingham.

1:05:02.770 --> 1:05:07.709
<i>And then, out near Reservoir
Hill, 1161, New Haven.</i>

1:06:17.912 --> 1:06:19.179
Peach, what's up?

1:06:19.747 --> 1:06:21.315
I just had that dream.

1:06:23.718 --> 1:06:24.719
Come, come.

1:06:28.589 --> 1:06:31.456
There was
this little girl crying.

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:34.492
Then she was like there,
but not there.

1:06:34.494 --> 1:06:35.828
Come on. Take this off.

1:06:37.397 --> 1:06:38.833
I can see through her.

1:06:41.335 --> 1:06:43.805
And then she keeps saying
she lost her body.

1:06:45.873 --> 1:06:48.375
She doesn't know that
I am her body.

1:06:55.315 --> 1:06:57.652
And I keep trying
to go closer to her.

1:07:00.554 --> 1:07:04.189
But she goes farther
and I go closer

1:07:04.191 --> 1:07:07.660
and she just
disappears

1:07:07.662 --> 1:07:09.296
and I'm just falling.

1:07:12.299 --> 1:07:14.767
And I just fall.

1:07:14.769 --> 1:07:18.572
I... It's like space
doesn't exist.

1:07:21.609 --> 1:07:24.879
And then I just...

1:07:26.814 --> 1:07:28.348
disappeared.

1:07:40.327 --> 1:07:41.863
You got so big,
you know that?

1:07:42.396 --> 1:07:45.599
You got so big.

1:07:46.901 --> 1:07:48.468
I love you!

1:07:49.971 --> 1:07:52.940
You love me, baby?
I love you, too.

1:07:54.809 --> 1:07:56.508
You're real pretty, baby.

1:08:04.819 --> 1:08:06.654
That's how you look at me,
you little freak?

1:08:11.425 --> 1:08:14.896
Ha!

1:09:09.583 --> 1:09:11.851
He'll be right in.
Anything else?

1:09:11.853 --> 1:09:13.386
- No, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:09:26.433 --> 1:09:27.935
Ah, thank you so much
for seeing me.

1:09:28.803 --> 1:09:29.935
Of course.

1:09:29.937 --> 1:09:31.939
- Miss?
- Loux Robins.

1:09:33.406 --> 1:09:34.940
What a beautiful name.

1:09:34.942 --> 1:09:36.611
Oh, thank... Thank you.

1:09:38.079 --> 1:09:41.346
Well, then,
why don't you tell me what you know.

1:09:41.348 --> 1:09:43.949
Well, he was my best friend.
We grew up together.

1:09:43.951 --> 1:09:46.652
He ran away
about 15 years ago.

1:09:46.654 --> 1:09:50.623
I brought with me a copy of the
report that was filed back then.

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:52.590
Um, there it is.

1:09:52.592 --> 1:09:55.562
His name is Oscar Grey.
He was 13.

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.901
Does something
look familiar to you?

1:10:03.771 --> 1:10:04.839
Where did you get this?

1:10:06.808 --> 1:10:08.709
I found it, um, at work.

1:10:09.977 --> 1:10:11.679
And where's work?

1:10:12.613 --> 1:10:14.048
Rineau Private Eye.

1:10:16.449 --> 1:10:17.484
I see.

1:10:19.787 --> 1:10:20.822
Tell me about yourself.

1:10:21.722 --> 1:10:26.027
Um, I just moved here
with my brother.

1:10:27.995 --> 1:10:30.095
And how's that going?

1:10:30.097 --> 1:10:31.966
Um, we're finding our way.

1:10:33.835 --> 1:10:35.100
Where are you staying?

1:10:35.102 --> 1:10:36.871
Um, we're at
the Desert Hills.

1:10:39.140 --> 1:10:41.408
That's a rough area
for a pretty girl.

1:10:43.476 --> 1:10:44.679
It's... It's been okay.

1:10:46.714 --> 1:10:49.480
I'll tell you what.
Leave this file with me.

1:10:49.482 --> 1:10:53.585
I'll ask around and see
if I can turn something up.

1:10:53.587 --> 1:10:55.955
That would be great.
Thank you so much, Officer.

1:10:55.957 --> 1:10:57.923
Jim. Call me Jim.

1:10:57.925 --> 1:10:59.861
Okay, Jim, thank you.

1:11:49.744 --> 1:11:52.177
Hi! Howdy. I'm Tali.

1:11:52.179 --> 1:11:54.179
- How you doing? I'm Bud.
- This is Bud.

1:11:54.181 --> 1:11:57.082
Um, we're in room 9
and our outlets are dead

1:11:57.084 --> 1:11:58.549
and I was just wondering

1:11:58.551 --> 1:12:00.551
if I could use yours
to straighten my hair.

1:12:00.553 --> 1:12:02.688
- My wife's crazy.
- I have a big interview.

1:12:02.690 --> 1:12:04.489
- Sweetie.
- She's got a big interview tomorrow.

1:12:04.491 --> 1:12:07.558
- Big interview and we're from Tallahassee.
- Tallahassee.

1:12:09.163 --> 1:12:13.132
Anyway, look, we'll just be
one foot in, one foot out.

1:12:13.134 --> 1:12:16.936
Oh, my God!
You are a lifesaver.

1:12:16.938 --> 1:12:20.540
Fucking move, I will blow your
brain straight through your skull.

1:12:21.842 --> 1:12:22.877
Anyone else here?

1:12:30.952 --> 1:12:32.053
What the...

1:12:43.530 --> 1:12:44.529
Oscar...

1:12:44.531 --> 1:12:46.999
Get the fuck over there.
Get the fuck over there.

1:12:47.001 --> 1:12:48.069
Get...

1:12:49.971 --> 1:12:51.105
Peaches, tie him up.

1:12:52.106 --> 1:12:53.272
You have the tape?

1:12:53.274 --> 1:12:54.673
Where did you leave
the tape?

1:12:54.675 --> 1:12:57.575
- In the fucking car.
- We talked about this in the car.

1:12:57.577 --> 1:12:59.311
Fucking do something
about it.

1:12:59.313 --> 1:13:01.113
We had a whole
fucking conversation

1:13:01.115 --> 1:13:02.715
about the tape
on the way over here.

1:13:02.717 --> 1:13:04.051
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:13:05.252 --> 1:13:06.952
Where's the fucking tape?

1:13:06.954 --> 1:13:08.055
Jesus Christ!

1:13:09.991 --> 1:13:11.890
It was not
my fucking job!

1:13:11.892 --> 1:13:13.025
What do you mean
it's not your job?

1:13:13.027 --> 1:13:15.694
I said we talked about it.
I said, "You tape him."

1:13:15.696 --> 1:13:17.264
I said I'm gonna put a...

1:13:18.199 --> 1:13:19.633
Don't move, all right?

1:13:25.272 --> 1:13:26.539
This is really bad.

1:13:32.313 --> 1:13:33.848
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

1:13:38.019 --> 1:13:39.186
- Oh!
- Yeah, yeah.

1:13:53.901 --> 1:13:56.637
- Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Oh. Sorry.

1:14:13.721 --> 1:14:16.722
Whoever they are,
they got everything on you.

1:14:16.724 --> 1:14:19.658
On us. Pictures, files.

1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:22.928
Looks like they knew everything
back a long fucking time.

1:14:22.930 --> 1:14:23.964
Oh, you saw it.

1:14:29.070 --> 1:14:31.906
You want to know what the most
difficult animal is to hunt?

1:14:34.975 --> 1:14:36.110
It's the American grizzly.

1:14:37.978 --> 1:14:39.647
Want to know why?

1:14:41.882 --> 1:14:44.850
You see that thing
from 200 meters out.

1:14:44.852 --> 1:14:46.821
You take a shot,
you don't kill it...

1:14:47.488 --> 1:14:49.056
Now that bear's hunting you.

1:14:51.425 --> 1:14:52.793
And when it comes for you...

1:14:54.862 --> 1:14:56.297
it's coming from behind.

1:15:01.802 --> 1:15:02.870
What are you saying, Bird?

1:15:06.073 --> 1:15:08.075
What I'm saying is,
they took their shot.

1:15:09.810 --> 1:15:10.911
And it wasn't a kill.

1:15:14.448 --> 1:15:15.716
Now we're hunting them.

1:15:34.869 --> 1:15:35.970
How you doing, Lester?

1:15:42.376 --> 1:15:43.410
Bird.

1:15:54.355 --> 1:15:55.422
Why don't you have a seat?

1:16:16.110 --> 1:16:17.978
I thought
we was friends, Lester.

1:16:20.147 --> 1:16:22.014
Friends?

1:16:22.016 --> 1:16:24.718
You were my sister's date
at the Sadie Hawkins dance.

1:16:28.956 --> 1:16:31.125
Yeah, yeah.

1:16:36.964 --> 1:16:38.899
I was real sorry to hear
about Margaret.

1:16:42.403 --> 1:16:43.670
I gotta tell ya,

1:16:43.672 --> 1:16:47.041
I was a little hurt you didn't
invite me to the funeral.

1:16:51.845 --> 1:16:52.913
Yeah, I...

1:16:55.382 --> 1:16:58.984
I don't... I...

1:16:58.986 --> 1:17:01.820
It's okay, Lester.
I'm just bustin' your balls.

1:17:04.124 --> 1:17:06.894
Well, you got me there.

1:17:09.897 --> 1:17:10.998
Where is she, Les?

1:17:12.967 --> 1:17:13.968
Who?

1:17:16.303 --> 1:17:18.172
Oh, the girl?

1:17:19.206 --> 1:17:20.374
Oh, well, um...

1:17:21.442 --> 1:17:22.476
She gone.

1:17:23.877 --> 1:17:26.780
Yeah, she, uh...
She split town. She...

1:17:31.452 --> 1:17:32.953
She, um...

1:17:35.022 --> 1:17:36.090
Shit.

1:17:39.593 --> 1:17:41.095
Bird, I told her to leave it.

1:17:44.098 --> 1:17:45.165
I see.

1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:55.075
You are
better than this, Bird.

1:17:56.611 --> 1:17:58.178
You know?

1:19:21.595 --> 1:19:22.863
We gotta go.

1:19:23.997 --> 1:19:24.998
- Okay.
- Now.

1:19:33.608 --> 1:19:35.342
- I'll get it.
- All right.

1:19:37.712 --> 1:19:39.411
Hello?

1:19:39.413 --> 1:19:41.148
Tell the Lost Boys
we're going on a camping trip.

1:19:41.683 --> 1:19:43.281
What are we gonna do??

1:19:43.283 --> 1:19:44.418
<i>Everyone packed up.</i>

1:19:44.786 --> 1:19:46.920
1133, Main.

1:19:48.222 --> 1:19:50.257
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1:19:54.528 --> 1:19:57.028
What's going on?

1:19:57.030 --> 1:19:58.698
We gotta pack up our shit.

1:19:58.700 --> 1:20:00.134
I'll get the van started.

1:20:02.536 --> 1:20:04.436
Hey, where's O?

1:20:04.438 --> 1:20:07.472
- Dive in.
- Come on. Come on. My name is Pockets, by the way.

1:20:07.474 --> 1:20:10.175
Hey, I'm Loux.
This is Amos.

1:20:10.177 --> 1:20:11.311
- Come on.
- All right.

1:20:42.042 --> 1:20:43.076
Miss Robins?

1:20:59.661 --> 1:21:00.728
Loux, Loux, Loux.

1:21:02.229 --> 1:21:04.064
Loux, Loux, Loux, Loux.

1:21:46.841 --> 1:21:48.442
You know what they do
to cop killers?

1:21:52.546 --> 1:21:53.715
They don't let 'em live.

1:21:57.251 --> 1:21:58.285
I know that.

1:22:00.187 --> 1:22:01.321
People like you...

1:22:03.323 --> 1:22:04.491
The fucking trash.

1:22:08.796 --> 1:22:10.564
This world ain't setup
for you to win.

1:22:15.369 --> 1:22:17.471
You'd be rotting in a cell
if it weren't for me.

1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:21.475
We gave you life.

1:22:24.679 --> 1:22:26.478
Tools.

1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:28.582
A community.

1:22:31.753 --> 1:22:33.655
And you wanna bite the hand
that fed you.

1:22:38.158 --> 1:22:39.192
Shame on you.

1:22:53.708 --> 1:22:55.576
You're never gonna
get out of here alive.

1:23:08.355 --> 1:23:09.456
You ain't a cop.

1:23:38.518 --> 1:23:41.188
- Peach.
- What are you doing?

1:23:41.588 --> 1:23:42.589
We need to go.

1:23:43.390 --> 1:23:44.924
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

1:23:44.926 --> 1:23:46.826
- We're going.
- No, we're not going.

1:23:46.828 --> 1:23:49.594
- What do you mean we're going?
- I mean, Loux came back.

1:23:49.596 --> 1:23:51.764
- Loux?
- Loux is back, yeah.

1:23:51.766 --> 1:23:53.933
- So you're gonna disappear?
- No, I'm no gonna...

1:23:53.935 --> 1:23:56.669
- Come on. We don't have time...
- You're fucking like everyone else!

1:23:56.671 --> 1:23:59.939
- Come on, stop. Come on...
- You promised you wouldn't disappear.

1:23:59.941 --> 1:24:01.941
- I'm not disappearing.
- You are disappearing.

1:24:01.943 --> 1:24:04.242
- I was just looking for you.
- You fucking lied!

1:24:04.244 --> 1:24:05.611
I didn't lie about shit.

1:24:05.613 --> 1:24:07.813
Come on, let's go...

1:24:07.815 --> 1:24:10.950
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:24:10.952 --> 1:24:13.385
- Oh, my God!
- What did you do?

1:24:13.387 --> 1:24:15.220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:24:15.222 --> 1:24:17.222
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry. I fucking...

1:24:17.224 --> 1:24:18.556
You fucking shot me!

1:24:18.558 --> 1:24:22.795
You fucking killed me!
Why are you so fucked up?

1:24:22.797 --> 1:24:25.665
Fuck, Peaches, you just
fucking killed me.

1:24:25.667 --> 1:24:27.633
You just fucking killed me.

1:24:27.635 --> 1:24:30.772
- Why did you do that? Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry.

1:24:31.673 --> 1:24:32.774
I'm sorry.

1:25:36.436 --> 1:25:37.839
We should get you
to a hospital.

1:25:42.910 --> 1:25:43.945
Don't stop.

1:25:47.447 --> 1:25:48.649
Promise me you won't stop.

1:25:51.485 --> 1:25:52.552
I promise.

1:25:55.322 --> 1:25:56.456
Well, what do we do now?

1:26:03.597 --> 1:26:04.932
You can always run
with the hunted.

1:26:09.604 --> 1:26:10.671
Cricket.

1:26:13.473 --> 1:26:14.541
Will you read to us?

1:26:22.784 --> 1:26:26.986
"To the red country and part of
the gray country of Oklahoma,

1:26:26.988 --> 1:26:28.823
"the last rains came gently,

1:26:30.057 --> 1:26:31.926
"and they did not cut
the scarred earth.

1:26:33.094 --> 1:26:36.631
"The plows crossed and
recrossed the rivulet marks.

1:26:38.431 --> 1:26:41.366
"The last rains
lifted the corn quickly

1:26:41.368 --> 1:26:45.570
"and scattered weed colonies and
grass along the sides of the roads

1:26:45.572 --> 1:26:49.010
"so that the gray country and the
dark red country began to disappear

1:26:49.811 --> 1:26:50.945
"under a green cover.

1:26:52.947 --> 1:26:55.981
"In the last part of May
the sky grew pale

1:26:55.983 --> 1:26:58.150
"and the clouds that had hung
in high puffs

1:26:58.152 --> 1:27:01.654
"for so long in the spring
were dissipated.

the edge of each green bayonet.

"The clouds appeared
