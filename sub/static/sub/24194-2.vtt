WEBVTT

00:01.441 --> 00:04.524
I sent you 63 good people.
You have to choose.

00:04.524 --> 00:06.317
BERTRAM GILFOYLE: They have
to meet our rigorous standards.

00:06.317 --> 00:08.358
I mean, look at the three
we've already hired.

00:09.025 --> 00:10.483
DINESH CHUGTAI: Stallions.

00:11.691 --> 00:14.483
Hooli is the future,
and your future is...

00:14.900 --> 00:17.691
The Box 2.
Are there any questions?

00:17.691 --> 00:19.983
Everything you're doing here
is antiquated.

00:20.524 --> 00:22.358
Fuck you guys.
Get out of here.

00:22.733 --> 00:26.192
You wish to acquire
a company called Sliceline?

00:26.192 --> 00:29.733
I will be taking on a total
engineering team of about 50.

00:30.025 --> 00:31.691
Um... Wha--

00:35.649 --> 00:37.941
-RICHARD HENDRICKS:
Don't tell anyone, okay?
-Um...

00:47.900 --> 00:49.566
Dinesh:
My Tesla finally came.

00:50.733 --> 00:52.649
Gilfoyle:
Was that a wise purchase?

00:52.649 --> 00:53.983
Considering Richard just

00:53.983 --> 00:57.524
obliterated Pied Piper's runway
hiring all those coders?

00:57.524 --> 00:59.775
I ordered it a month ago.

00:59.775 --> 01:02.483
But still, it's an investment.

01:02.483 --> 01:03.775
As I understand,

01:03.775 --> 01:05.441
cars depreciate
10 percent

01:05.441 --> 01:06.900
as soon as they
fall off the truck.

01:07.983 --> 01:09.275
Like that.

01:09.275 --> 01:12.941
So if the car costs $100,

01:12.941 --> 01:14.941
well you just lost $10.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.775
Did it cost $100?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.275
Or more?

01:19.275 --> 01:20.900
It's not about the money.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.858
I, my friend, am now part

01:23.858 --> 01:25.441
of the green revolution.

01:25.441 --> 01:26.775
Are you?

01:26.775 --> 01:28.192
Most electricity
still comes from

01:28.192 --> 01:30.317
gas plants
and coal-burning
smoke stacks.

01:30.317 --> 01:32.941
Do you know where
your electricity comes from?

01:32.941 --> 01:34.816
No.
Mm-hmm.

01:36.275 --> 01:38.483
Look how shiny it is.

01:38.483 --> 01:40.275
Plus, it has a frunk--

01:40.275 --> 01:41.649
a front trunk.

01:41.649 --> 01:43.983
Here, hop in, let me
give you a ride to work.

01:50.150 --> 01:51.900
Dinesh,

01:51.900 --> 01:52.941
you like this?

01:52.941 --> 01:56.358
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:56.358 --> 01:58.941
Is that a dead pig?
Yes.

01:58.941 --> 02:01.275
It's just like Errich.

02:01.275 --> 02:02.691
My corrupt uncle

02:02.691 --> 02:04.483
sent a death certificate

02:04.483 --> 02:05.441
from China

02:05.441 --> 02:08.649
but to send body
is too expensive.

02:08.649 --> 02:10.358
So...

02:10.358 --> 02:12.358
I cremate a pig

02:12.358 --> 02:15.524
because a pig is
most like a fat human.

02:16.941 --> 02:18.108
I gotta get to work.

02:19.150 --> 02:20.275
Dinesh...

02:20.275 --> 02:22.983
can you take
pig to backyard?

02:22.983 --> 02:24.649
I need to burn it.

02:24.649 --> 02:25.816
No.

02:27.483 --> 02:29.524
♪ ♪

02:33.816 --> 02:34.900
That's odd.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.192
You left before me.

02:36.192 --> 02:38.317
How was I able
to park before you?

02:38.317 --> 02:40.025
I guess all 50
of the new employees

02:40.025 --> 02:41.483
decided to show up
bright and early

02:41.483 --> 02:43.691
for the fucking
all-hands meeting.

02:43.691 --> 02:45.524
I had to park on level five.

02:45.524 --> 02:47.566
Huh! So unlike you,

02:47.566 --> 02:48.858
the world understands

02:48.858 --> 02:50.608
that I'm saving the planet

02:50.608 --> 02:52.275
and has rewarded me with...

02:52.275 --> 02:54.233
primo spot.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.608
Congratulations.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.441
You've finally taken
your rightful spot

02:57.441 --> 02:59.025
amongst the handicapped.

03:13.108 --> 03:14.233
Is it broken?

03:15.150 --> 03:17.233
Uh, no.
I think I'm okay.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.816
One question,
what the fuck happened?

03:19.816 --> 03:22.399
'Cause... you were
doing your speech

03:22.399 --> 03:24.399
right there in front
of the whole company,

03:24.399 --> 03:25.399
and then...

03:26.524 --> 03:27.566
Wow.

03:27.566 --> 03:29.067
Well...

03:29.067 --> 03:31.566
uh, my speech was going poorly.

03:31.566 --> 03:32.733
Agreed.
Yeah.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.399
And I started to panic.

03:34.399 --> 03:35.441
With good reason.

03:35.441 --> 03:37.233
And then...

03:37.233 --> 03:39.025
all of a sudden, I...

03:39.025 --> 03:40.566
I thought I had
to shit my pants, okay?

03:40.566 --> 03:42.067
And that's why you jumped

03:42.067 --> 03:44.775
face first into
a glass wall?

03:44.775 --> 03:46.399
No, it all happened so fast,

03:46.399 --> 03:49.108
but... essentially, I thought,

03:49.108 --> 03:51.649
if it was gonna happen,
I didn't want to be standing.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.775
So, I crouched, because...

03:53.775 --> 03:54.816
If you wanna
shit yourself,

03:54.816 --> 03:56.691
you'd rather be
crouching than standing?

03:56.691 --> 03:58.941
Yes. I mean, if you had to.

03:58.941 --> 04:02.275
I hate to say this,
but I follow you.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.275
The thing is,
when I crouched,
I had to burp.

04:05.275 --> 04:08.067
But since I was all,
you know, tucked up,

04:08.067 --> 04:09.441
I actually
vomited a little.

04:09.441 --> 04:12.941
And then, that's when
my fight-or-flight
reflex kicked in.

04:12.941 --> 04:15.067
Do you ever fight?

04:15.067 --> 04:19.150
Okay, fine, then my
"or flight" reflex kicked in
and I just...

04:20.275 --> 04:21.733
Pow.
Yeah.

04:21.733 --> 04:25.399
Okay. Well, what we saw
was a very oily man

04:25.399 --> 04:27.399
in mid-sentence dip down,

04:27.399 --> 04:30.941
vomit, and then
thrust himself violently

04:30.941 --> 04:34.067
face first into
a glass wall.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.691
But I guess it's a lot
less embarrassing

04:35.691 --> 04:36.816
the way you explain it.

04:36.816 --> 04:38.983
Richard, what about...

04:38.983 --> 04:41.025
Did you evacuate
in your pants?

04:41.025 --> 04:42.483
Oh, no, uh, good news.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.649
I think what happened
when I hit the glass,

04:44.649 --> 04:46.067
I sort of shocked myself.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.275
Now, I don't have to.

04:47.275 --> 04:48.733
That's actually
kind of disappointing,

04:48.733 --> 04:51.483
because, like,
no closure.

04:51.483 --> 04:53.649
Well, on the bright side,
it'll be that much easier

04:53.649 --> 04:55.317
to get you cleaned up
and back out there.

04:55.317 --> 04:58.649
What?
I have you scheduled for
three more days of orientation.

04:58.649 --> 05:00.317
No way. Cancel them.

05:00.317 --> 05:01.775
There's no way
I'm going back out there.

05:01.775 --> 05:03.983
Especially after knowing
what they saw.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.733
No, fuck it. Plus, I'm--
I'm way too busy, so.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.275
Gentlemen, could we
have the room please?

05:09.275 --> 05:10.858
So we can leave?
Sweet.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.441
Richard,
look out there.

05:14.441 --> 05:17.858
There's Optimoji
and Sliceline t-shirts
left and right.

05:17.858 --> 05:21.150
These are conquered soldiers
still in their old uniforms.

05:21.150 --> 05:23.691
But we need everyone here
to be Pied Pipers.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.691
I mean, you're asking them

05:25.691 --> 05:28.233
to spend the primes
of their lives on your vision.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.566
Right? And you need
to go out there
and lead them.

05:30.566 --> 05:32.691
They're-- they're yearning
for inspiration.

05:32.691 --> 05:34.608
I can't do inspiration.

05:34.608 --> 05:36.150
I'm a coder.

05:36.150 --> 05:37.733
Look there,
the new Internet.

05:37.733 --> 05:39.233
That's inspiration.
Use that.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.192
Richard, this is all an idea.

05:41.192 --> 05:42.608
And people don't
wanna follow an idea,

05:42.608 --> 05:44.192
they wanna follow a leader.

05:44.192 --> 05:46.483
Look at the last guy
to create a new Internet.

05:46.483 --> 05:47.483
Al Gore.

05:47.483 --> 05:49.025
His ideas were excellent,

05:49.025 --> 05:51.858
but he talked like a
narcoleptic plantation owner,

05:51.858 --> 05:54.067
so he lost the presidency
to a fake cowboy

05:54.067 --> 05:55.649
and now he makes
apocalypse porn.

05:55.649 --> 05:57.983
Look, the point is,
you need to lead
with passion.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.441
When you set your mind to it,

05:59.441 --> 06:01.900
you're one of the most
charismatic people
I've ever met.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.483
And I have met Ira Glass.

06:03.483 --> 06:05.441
I know it's three days
we could be working,

06:05.441 --> 06:09.317
but ultimately, a unified team
will save us time in the end.

06:09.317 --> 06:10.858
You wanna save time?

06:10.858 --> 06:13.108
If you wanna save time,
here's what you do.

06:13.108 --> 06:15.358
You said it yourself,
okay, the Optimoji guys

06:15.358 --> 06:17.358
and the Sliceline guys
are separate,

06:17.358 --> 06:18.858
with their own
separate histories,

06:18.858 --> 06:20.608
their own separate
shorthands,

06:20.608 --> 06:21.816
so let's use that.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.067
Let's give the scheduler
to the Optimoji guys,

06:24.067 --> 06:26.483
and the server-less runtime
to the Sliceline guys.

06:26.483 --> 06:29.733
Then we have Dinesh
and Gilfoyle and the Stallions,
they do the integration.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.483
Boom, we're off and running.
How about that?

06:31.483 --> 06:34.900
That way,
no one has to shit
or burp or puke

06:34.900 --> 06:37.483
or get a nosebleed
in front of anyone.

06:37.483 --> 06:40.192
Scott:
As for the bezel design,
our young aesthete, Dang,

06:40.192 --> 06:41.816
has once again spun gold.

06:41.816 --> 06:42.941
Let's see it.

06:46.983 --> 06:49.275
Wait, my signature's not on it?

06:49.275 --> 06:53.275
How could it be
the Gavin Belson
Signature Box III

06:53.275 --> 06:54.816
without Gavin Belson's
signature on it?

06:54.816 --> 06:57.983
Well, the word "signature"
has a handwritten feel to it.

06:57.983 --> 07:00.900
Why is my signature
not on this?

07:00.900 --> 07:04.108
Gavin, there was
a slight issue with
your signature.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.733
What issue?

07:05.733 --> 07:07.275
Do you have a mock
Pull it up.

07:08.983 --> 07:11.150
Ah, yes! There.

07:12.150 --> 07:13.608
What's wrong with that?

07:13.608 --> 07:17.441
Well, reactions to this
from our testing groups
were mixed,

07:17.441 --> 07:21.150
so we contacted
a handwriting expert.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.983
And, uh, well...

07:22.983 --> 07:24.691
Jean, do you
have the report?

07:24.691 --> 07:25.858
Absolutely.

07:25.858 --> 07:28.275
Pleasure to be
on your team, Gavin.
Here it is.

07:28.275 --> 07:30.483
"The signature

It's the cheapest thing
I could find

08:00.691 --> 08:02.566
that qualified
as an electric vehicle.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.192
I found it on Craigslist.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.691
Now you get to park

Enjoy the drive.

08:07.816 --> 08:09.566
Oh, and you were right...

it does feel good to be

Oh, yeah?
Well, does that "vehicle"
have "Insane Mode"?

08:16.399 --> 08:17.816
One press of a button

What a day.

See, we'd still be
finishing up orientation,

08:27.275 --> 08:30.067
singing Kumbayas
and doing trust falls.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.233
But instead,

08:31.233 --> 08:34.566
both our Optimoji
and Sliceline teams

08:34.566 --> 08:38.983
have gone through
their first code review.

08:38.983 --> 08:41.858
Well, to be fair, I never
would've scheduled trust falls.

08:41.858 --> 08:44.275
I mean, you do
one of those, you're so
jacked up on adrenaline,

08:44.275 --> 08:45.858
the rest of the day
is basically shot.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.317
We were gonna have
a noncompetitive
talent show with no losers.

08:49.317 --> 08:50.317
Not possible.

08:50.317 --> 08:52.524
Dick, I just got in
and checked the commits.

08:52.524 --> 08:55.067
Are you aware
that the Sliceline guys

08:55.067 --> 08:57.067
have been encoding time
in nanoseconds,

08:57.067 --> 08:58.275
as we usually do,

08:58.275 --> 09:01.858
but the Optimoji guys
have been using milliseconds?

09:01.858 --> 09:03.566
What?

09:03.566 --> 09:05.441
Just the fact that
we're still calling them

09:05.441 --> 09:07.524
Sliceline guys
and Optimoji guys

09:07.524 --> 09:09.192
is sending up
all sorts of red flags.

09:09.192 --> 09:10.858
And I don't even
mean the word "guys,"

09:10.858 --> 09:12.483
which I just learned
is a micro-aggression.

09:12.483 --> 09:15.067
It's fine, "guys."

09:15.067 --> 09:16.900
I will get them
to re-factor their code.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.399
We're still ahead
of where we'd be

09:19.399 --> 09:21.233
if we were doing
some kind of talent show.

09:21.233 --> 09:24.399
Richard? Gilfoyle parked
his electric pile of trash

Do you think that's fair?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.691
Not now, Dinesh.

09:28.691 --> 09:30.524
Why can't you guys
switch to milliseconds?

09:30.524 --> 09:31.775
Why do we have to change?

09:31.775 --> 09:35.108
Sorry, well, our entire
code base uses nanoseconds.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.192
And you didn't think
it was important
to tell us this?

09:38.192 --> 09:39.733
No, well, I mean, it was--

09:39.733 --> 09:43.192
it was part
of the orientation
that was scheduled,

09:43.192 --> 09:44.483
which had to be,

09:44.483 --> 09:46.441
for numerous reasons,
uh, canceled.

09:46.441 --> 09:49.275
And I'm sorry about that,
I know it sucks.

09:49.275 --> 09:51.649
If I could make it
suck less, I would, but--

09:51.649 --> 09:53.775
You could get some
decent coffee in here.

09:53.775 --> 09:55.566
What? What's wrong with...

09:55.566 --> 09:57.858
Philz Coffee?
That's high-end joe, bro.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.608
At Optimoji,
we had Stumptown
brought in every day.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.275
So that would inspire you?
Different coffee?

10:04.275 --> 10:05.192
Inspire us?

10:05.192 --> 10:06.524
You know what?
Bup, bup, bup!

10:06.524 --> 10:07.900
Stumptown it is.
You got it.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.524
And you'll tell your guys
about the nanoseconds?

10:10.524 --> 10:12.108
Yeah.
Unless you wanna

10:12.108 --> 10:13.983
get up in front of everyone
and announce it yourself.

10:13.983 --> 10:15.358
No, no, no,
I'd rather you--

10:15.358 --> 10:16.566
That was a joke.

10:16.566 --> 10:17.858
Your speech was a disaster.

10:17.858 --> 10:20.025
Oh.
Yeah.

10:23.192 --> 10:24.317
You know. Yeah.

10:24.317 --> 10:25.483
It was really bad.

10:25.483 --> 10:27.483
I know.

10:27.483 --> 10:30.691
Okay, Mr. Jian, you have
petitioned this court

10:30.691 --> 10:32.150
to become the sole executor

10:32.150 --> 10:35.108
of the estate of Erlich Bachman,
is that correct?

10:35.108 --> 10:36.317
Yes.

10:36.317 --> 10:38.150
I see you've got
all the paperwork, here.

10:38.150 --> 10:42.025
Yes. Errich Bachman
is dead.

10:43.483 --> 10:44.983
Oh! Um...

10:44.983 --> 10:46.900
Mr. Jian, there's
absolutely no need

10:46.900 --> 10:49.275
to display
the deceased remains.

10:49.275 --> 10:50.983
You can put that away.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.691
I have it.
Yes.

10:53.691 --> 10:54.983
Please put it down.

10:58.067 --> 11:01.858
Errich Bachman
is cremated...

11:01.858 --> 11:03.192
into ashes.

11:04.608 --> 11:06.192
And I put it in bucket.

11:06.192 --> 11:08.858
Put it down, sir.

11:12.733 --> 11:14.150
Now, have you determined

11:14.150 --> 11:15.775
to a reasonable
degree of certainty

11:15.775 --> 11:18.358
that Mr. Bachman has
no living next of kin?

11:18.358 --> 11:20.816
No wife,
children, parents,

11:20.816 --> 11:22.025
no brothers, sisters,

11:22.025 --> 11:23.524
nieces, nephews,
grandparents,

11:23.524 --> 11:25.192
children from
a predeceased spouse

11:25.192 --> 11:26.192
or domestic partnership?

11:27.317 --> 11:28.441
No.

11:28.441 --> 11:29.691
He died alone.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.524
He's a very sad man.

11:32.524 --> 11:34.483
So, I have a...

11:34.483 --> 11:36.900
a house
and a 10% Pied Piper.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.733
In the absence
of any next of kin,

11:39.733 --> 11:42.566
I will approve you
as the sole beneficiary

11:42.566 --> 11:45.399
and the official executor
of Mr. Bachman's estate.

11:45.399 --> 11:48.441
But, before you can distribute
any of his assets

11:48.441 --> 11:49.941
into your personal possession,

11:49.941 --> 11:53.566
you are required
to settle all claims
against the estate.

11:53.566 --> 11:54.733
Do you understand?

11:56.067 --> 11:58.733
So I get a house
and a 10% Pied Piper?

11:58.733 --> 12:01.775
You need to pay all
of his outstanding bills.

12:01.775 --> 12:04.358
How much do I have to pay?

12:04.358 --> 12:08.192
Well, these debts can
sometimes be substantial.

12:08.192 --> 12:09.941
Would you
characterize Mr. Bachman

12:09.941 --> 12:12.067
as a financially
responsible man?

12:17.025 --> 12:20.649
Hey, Sliceline guys,
what's up? Heh.

12:20.649 --> 12:22.192
So...

12:22.192 --> 12:24.983
wanted to talk to
you guys about something.

12:24.983 --> 12:26.108
Past couple days,

12:26.108 --> 12:29.233
the Optimoji guys have really
stepped up their game,

12:29.233 --> 12:31.816
but, um, you guys...

12:31.816 --> 12:34.941
have kind of been flagging.

12:34.941 --> 12:37.275
I'm just wondering if
everything's all right.

12:37.275 --> 12:39.358
Yeah. Great.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.192
Just nice to know
where we stand.

12:41.192 --> 12:43.691
Sorry?
We get it.

12:43.691 --> 12:46.192
You only acquired Sliceline
because you wanted Optimoji.

12:46.192 --> 12:48.150
What

12:48.150 --> 12:49.441
No, wrong.

12:49.441 --> 12:51.441
Uh, why would you say that?

12:51.441 --> 12:52.983
I didn't. You did,

12:52.983 --> 12:54.775
when you chose
their coffee over ours.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.649
It's bad enough
we can't have Slice here.

12:56.649 --> 12:58.649
Slice?

12:58.649 --> 12:59.649
The beverage?

12:59.649 --> 13:01.649
No, no. Slice was our mascot.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.983
He's really smart.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.358
Okay, well...

13:05.358 --> 13:06.691
Bring the little guy in.

13:06.691 --> 13:08.358
What about the no dog policy?

13:08.358 --> 13:11.275
What no dog policy, huh?

13:11.275 --> 13:14.275
Really? Are you sure you don't
need to check with Optimoji?

13:14.275 --> 13:16.275
I'm pretty sure,
but, uh...

13:17.566 --> 13:19.358
Danny

13:19.358 --> 13:21.441
Uh, I just was wondering

13:21.441 --> 13:23.566
if you're cool
if the Sliceline guys

13:23.566 --> 13:25.649
brought in their dog.
He's really smart.

13:25.649 --> 13:28.608
Well at Optimoji,
we had a no dog policy.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.275
Come on.
Don't be such a dork.

13:31.275 --> 13:32.816
Let 'em have it.
It's just a dog.

13:33.983 --> 13:35.608
Sure. Fine.

13:35.608 --> 13:36.649
You're the CEO.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.399
Yes, I am.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.441
All right.

13:39.441 --> 13:41.399
And from this point on,

13:41.399 --> 13:45.067
CEO stands for
Canine Endorsement...

13:46.524 --> 13:48.566
Oh... yeah.

13:49.858 --> 13:51.067
All right.

13:54.192 --> 13:58.275
Hey, look at you
and your 10-speed.

13:58.275 --> 14:01.150
Aw, you got up early
'cause you thought
you could take my space.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.483
That's cute.

14:02.483 --> 14:04.358
Almost as cute as your bike.

14:06.691 --> 14:08.566
Yeah, I guess
this is a bike, isn't it?

14:09.858 --> 14:12.192
So I get to use the bike lane.

14:12.192 --> 14:14.524
See you later.

14:14.524 --> 14:17.358
No, bikes still have
to follow traffic laws!

14:17.358 --> 14:18.524
That's not fair!

14:20.108 --> 14:21.608
All right.
You wanna get insane?

14:24.067 --> 14:25.358
Let's get insane.

14:26.858 --> 14:28.233
Whoa!

14:30.566 --> 14:32.025
Fuck you, Gilfoyle!

14:42.317 --> 14:45.399
Something's wrong
with your frunk.

14:45.399 --> 14:46.816
It's all frucked up.

14:46.816 --> 14:48.192
Hey, Tesla!

14:48.192 --> 14:49.941
You know where Pied Piper is?

14:54.900 --> 14:55.941
Right here, guys.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.233
What the fuck?

15:02.150 --> 15:03.233
Dick?

15:03.233 --> 15:04.233
Hey, uh...

15:04.233 --> 15:06.816
Explain.
Okay, uh...

15:06.816 --> 15:10.275
So, Optimoji had
a no dog policy

15:10.275 --> 15:12.233
and apparently that's because
every single one of 'em

15:12.233 --> 15:13.775
have a fucking dog.

15:13.775 --> 15:15.317
And when we waived our
no dog policy...

15:15.317 --> 15:17.025
You waived our no dog policy?

15:17.025 --> 15:19.524
I had Jared put that in there
for a reason, Richard!

15:19.524 --> 15:22.441
In Pakistan,
dogs are not pets, okay?

15:22.441 --> 15:23.775
They're vicious beasts

15:23.775 --> 15:25.275
and they chase you
down the street

15:25.275 --> 15:26.399
and they bite you.

15:26.399 --> 15:28.483
My cousin Eftahar
lost an ear.

15:28.483 --> 15:30.441
Our mayor was
very corrupt.

15:30.441 --> 15:32.566
But he put poison pills
in chicken meat

15:32.566 --> 15:34.275
to take care
of the dog problem.

15:34.275 --> 15:35.441
We hailed him as a hero.

15:35.441 --> 15:37.108
We put up statues
of him everywhere.

15:37.108 --> 15:38.775
He's gonna be okay.

15:38.775 --> 15:40.524
Who's gonna be okay?

15:40.524 --> 15:42.399
What

15:42.399 --> 15:44.067
He's violently
allergic to dogs.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.025
It's another reason for our
iron-clad no dog policy.

15:47.025 --> 15:49.566
Jared, when were you planning
on telling me all of this?

15:49.566 --> 15:51.317
Day two of orientation.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.983
Right after safe space charades.

15:52.983 --> 15:56.566
So look, we'll pay for
your entire medical bill,
obviously.

15:56.566 --> 15:57.775
So, you're good.

15:57.775 --> 15:59.691
You're covering
his deductible?

15:59.691 --> 16:01.441
Then you have
to cover ours, right?

16:01.441 --> 16:03.233
And what about the dogs?
They're people, too.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.941
They're literally not.

16:04.941 --> 16:06.317
They're dogs!

16:06.317 --> 16:08.150
Hold strong.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.317
Fuck you!

16:17.192 --> 16:18.733
Oh.
So...

16:18.733 --> 16:22.900
Jared, uh, you wanted me
to unite the teams and I have.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.858
They are united against me.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.317
Even the dogs,
apparently.

16:28.317 --> 16:30.067
I wish they had
your fecal fortitude.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.775
Hey, do me a favor and...

16:34.192 --> 16:37.150
just take care of all the dogs.

16:37.150 --> 16:38.900
And then call an all-hands.

16:38.900 --> 16:43.025
I've clearly gotta
say words.

16:45.691 --> 16:47.317
Ooh, okay.

16:47.317 --> 16:51.192
Really didn't wanna
be back up here, again.

16:51.192 --> 16:52.816
And I think we all
remember why, you know?

16:52.816 --> 16:55.441
But you probably
don't know this,
but I almost sh--

16:55.441 --> 16:56.524
They don't need to...

16:56.524 --> 16:57.983
Farted. Yeah.

16:59.275 --> 17:01.150
Which would be embarrassing.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.108
Anyway, look, uh...

17:03.108 --> 17:04.816
I know I...

17:04.816 --> 17:08.233
should be the inspiration
for you guys,

17:08.233 --> 17:11.399
but to be honest,
that's not really who I am.

17:12.358 --> 17:14.441
And if this company
lives or dies

17:14.441 --> 17:16.524
by all the flowery
things I say,

17:16.524 --> 17:18.399
well then, to be honest,
we're fucked. Ha.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.775
They say that...

17:21.775 --> 17:24.025
people don't follow ideas.

17:24.025 --> 17:27.108
But I think in this case,
you guys should.

17:27.108 --> 17:28.858
Because...

17:28.858 --> 17:31.275
the idea of creating
a new Internet,

17:31.275 --> 17:33.566
that's special.

17:33.566 --> 17:35.816
Right? And we've been
given the opportunity

17:35.816 --> 17:37.983
to rewrite...

17:37.983 --> 17:42.524
the most important thing
in human history.

17:42.524 --> 17:44.317
And we can build it

17:44.317 --> 17:46.816
the way it should've
been made all along.

17:46.816 --> 17:51.108
You know, not this
shitty, addictive parasite

17:51.108 --> 17:54.150
that companies like
Hooli use to spy on us

17:54.150 --> 17:56.108
and exploit us.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.108
Okay?

17:58.025 --> 17:59.941
There.
That's your inspiration.

17:59.941 --> 18:01.108
Not me.

18:01.108 --> 18:03.816
Not coffee. Not dogs. So...

18:05.608 --> 18:07.900
if I'm not inspirational
enough for you,

18:07.900 --> 18:09.358
and if you don't
wanna be here,

18:09.358 --> 18:11.358
well, then,
there's the door.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.941
And we'll give you
enough severance

18:12.941 --> 18:14.566
to cover you to your next job.

18:14.566 --> 18:17.733
But if you wanna stick around
and build this thing,

18:17.733 --> 18:20.150
then we've got work to do.

18:20.150 --> 18:23.108
♪ ♪

18:26.775 --> 18:27.816
Great job.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.150
So what's going on?
I hear footsteps.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.399
Are-- are people
sitting back down, or...?

18:31.399 --> 18:33.275
Okay, they're picking
up their bags.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.192
That could be good.

18:36.192 --> 18:38.275
Okay. So, what,
they're leaving, or...?

18:38.275 --> 18:39.691
A few are.

18:40.983 --> 18:42.399
Okay, what's a few?

18:42.399 --> 18:44.649
It's more than a few.

18:44.649 --> 18:47.275
What's that mean?
Like, what's more
than a few, five?

18:47.275 --> 18:48.483
Double digits?

18:48.483 --> 18:51.067
Jared:
It might be easier to say
how many are staying.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.941
It's, uh...

18:52.941 --> 18:54.275
It's two.

18:54.275 --> 18:55.483
What?

18:57.983 --> 18:59.025
Richard:
Okay.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.317
So, uh,

19:04.317 --> 19:06.067
Richard, what--
what do you wanna do here?

19:06.067 --> 19:07.775
What are you talking about?
I'm doing it.

19:07.775 --> 19:09.983
Sorry?
I'm a coder, Jared.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.399
So I'm gonna code.

19:11.399 --> 19:13.733
And if I have to build my entire
new fucking internet by myself,

19:13.733 --> 19:15.733
I'll do that, so...

19:18.566 --> 19:20.025
Oh, dear.

19:21.524 --> 19:22.566
I like it.

19:22.566 --> 19:24.649
It's just so edgy.

19:24.649 --> 19:26.900
Banksy is a very
edgy artist.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.067
The edgiest.

19:29.691 --> 19:31.025
Gavin:
What is this?

19:32.566 --> 19:36.025
Banksy is insisting
his signature be
on his work.

19:36.025 --> 19:38.025
This is supposed
to be my signature.

19:38.025 --> 19:41.691
On what planet
does a signature
have a signature on it?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.399
I'm afraid it's
non-negotiable.

19:45.399 --> 19:48.150
The fucking balls
on this egomaniac.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.941
You know what?
Fuck Banksy.

19:49.941 --> 19:52.691
We're on a campus
full of literally thousands

19:52.691 --> 19:55.233
of the greatest
creative minds in the world.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.816
Let's just crowd source it
with our employees.
We'll make it a contest.

19:57.816 --> 19:59.858
People will feel empowered
and part of the team.

19:59.858 --> 20:01.483
And it won't cost us shit.

20:01.483 --> 20:04.150
You see? This is what
a benevolent leader does.

20:04.150 --> 20:05.192
Make it happen.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.108
Sir, is this a good time?

20:10.108 --> 20:12.150
It's a great time.
I just fired Banksy.

20:12.150 --> 20:13.317
Banksy, the vandal?

20:13.317 --> 20:16.233
The very one. Now,
what do you have for me?

20:16.233 --> 20:17.317
Good news.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.649
I'm hearing that Pied Piper
is in a free-fall.

20:20.649 --> 20:23.317
From whom?
All I can say
without implicating you

20:23.317 --> 20:25.192
is that I've instituted
an operation

20:25.192 --> 20:27.317
to safeguard our interests.

20:27.317 --> 20:29.858
I'm calling it
"Project Washburn."

20:29.858 --> 20:31.150
What I'm planning to--

20:31.150 --> 20:33.275
Hoover, you're
implicating me.

20:38.983 --> 20:41.775
Are we bad people
for leaving Richard there
to work by himself?

20:41.775 --> 20:44.192
We've been coding
for 48 hours straight.

20:44.192 --> 20:47.233
I could give a shit about
deontological ethics.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.816
Yang.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.649
There better not be
a Chinaman in my bed.

20:52.649 --> 20:54.441
That is racist.

20:54.441 --> 20:55.441
Yes.

20:56.441 --> 20:57.608
I am racist.

21:02.524 --> 21:03.733
Stupid Errich.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.775
Big mortgage.

21:05.775 --> 21:07.275
Seven credit cards.

21:07.275 --> 21:09.358
Not even one with miles.

21:09.358 --> 21:11.775
Fucking loser.

21:11.775 --> 21:15.941
It almost not worth
to take his house from him.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.025
Fat fuck.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.317
Speaking of crazy bills,

21:18.317 --> 21:20.816
you know how much
it's going to cost
to fix my Tesla?

21:20.816 --> 21:22.649
$17,000.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.108
I can't afford to pay that.

21:26.566 --> 21:28.441
But I can't afford
not to pay it.

21:28.441 --> 21:29.900
If I don't fix my Tesla,

21:29.900 --> 21:31.192
Gilfoyle wins.

21:31.192 --> 21:33.483
And I need to really
shove it up his ass.

21:33.483 --> 21:35.067
Wait.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.649
Do I really hate
someone so much

21:36.649 --> 21:39.816
that defeating them
is worth more than money?

21:39.816 --> 21:41.441
Is that really
what I've become?

21:43.150 --> 21:44.317
Yeah, it is.

21:44.317 --> 21:45.941
I'm gonna pay it.

21:45.941 --> 21:47.025
Thanks, Jian-Yang.

21:51.691 --> 21:52.858
I'll pay, too.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.483
Fuck you, Errich.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.025
You can't just
leave your bike-car

22:00.025 --> 22:01.649
in my Tesla's spot
and Uber home.

22:01.649 --> 22:03.025
That's not fair, Gilfoyle.

22:03.025 --> 22:05.816
Mmm, you don't seem
to understand.

22:05.816 --> 22:07.524
It's my spot now.

22:10.941 --> 22:11.983
What are they doing back?

22:11.983 --> 22:14.025
Hey. Where have you been?

22:14.025 --> 22:15.483
Sleeping.

22:15.483 --> 22:18.192
What

22:18.192 --> 22:20.858
We assumed you guys
were right behind us.
What's happening?

22:20.858 --> 22:22.025
Oh!

22:23.025 --> 22:24.192
Something.

22:24.192 --> 22:25.858
Something is happening.

22:25.858 --> 22:27.358
When you left,
I thought he was fried.

22:27.358 --> 22:30.025
Okay? Because his shoulders
were all tight,

22:30.025 --> 22:31.900
and he wouldn't answer
to his name,

22:31.900 --> 22:33.108
and his eyes went dead,

22:33.108 --> 22:34.233
like when I tell him
I love him.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.441
But then, he just got stronger

22:36.441 --> 22:37.649
and he started
picking up speed,

22:37.649 --> 22:39.941
so I texted a few
of the Sliceline guys

22:39.941 --> 22:42.317
and then they texted
some of the Optimoji guys,

22:42.317 --> 22:43.733
and they all
wanted to see it.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.233
Richard has finished
the scheduler

22:46.233 --> 22:47.524
and is almost
ready to merge

22:47.524 --> 22:49.108
the server-less runtime.
Look, look!

22:49.108 --> 22:51.067
Gilfoyle:
He implemented
all those tasks?

22:51.067 --> 22:52.733
By himself?

22:52.733 --> 22:54.900
That was supposed to take
the whole team four days.

22:56.233 --> 22:57.900
It's amazing.
I mean, I feel--

22:57.900 --> 23:00.233
I feel like Mary Magdalene
on resurrection day.

23:00.233 --> 23:02.733
And that's not
the greatest miracle of all.

23:02.733 --> 23:05.108
Look. Look at the coders.

23:05.108 --> 23:07.233
They're all wearing
Pied Piper hoodies.

23:07.233 --> 23:08.775
He pushed another commit.

23:08.775 --> 23:09.858
Dinesh:
What the fuck?

23:09.858 --> 23:11.566
Flawless. Right?

23:11.566 --> 23:14.691
Um, it takes a while
to read a whole commit.

23:14.691 --> 23:16.775
They've been cheering
after every commit.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.566
I mean, they haven't,
but it's--

23:18.566 --> 23:19.691
it's great.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.150
♪ ♪

23:26.608 --> 23:28.275
Richard:
I thought I had
to shit my pants.

23:28.275 --> 23:29.900
So, I crouched.

23:31.941 --> 23:33.108
I actually vomited.

23:35.108 --> 23:37.983
Fight-or-flight reflex
kicked in and I just...

23:40.691 --> 23:42.358
Jared:
Richard!

23:42.358 --> 23:43.941
Man:
Richard?

23:43.941 --> 23:45.441
Richard?

23:45.441 --> 23:46.858
Hey, buddy boy.

23:46.858 --> 23:50.233
Oh, there he is.

23:50.233 --> 23:52.608
What's

23:52.608 --> 23:54.108
Don't flip out, okay?

23:54.108 --> 23:57.483
But you have been
in a coma for four years.

23:57.483 --> 23:58.566
What?

23:58.566 --> 24:00.108
That's correct.

24:00.108 --> 24:02.275
In fact,
I'm a robot.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.150
The real Dr. Crawford
died heroically

24:05.150 --> 24:07.025
in the water wars of 2020.

24:08.775 --> 24:11.233
Jokes, Richard!

24:11.233 --> 24:12.608
I'm just joking around.

24:12.608 --> 24:14.358
What, did you sell
your sense of humor?

24:16.816 --> 24:18.566
You've just been out
for about six hours.

24:18.566 --> 24:20.900
You were not even
unconscious,
really just asleep.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.900
But you did lose
a whole lot of blood.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.983
I just hope they
put the right kind back in.

24:26.483 --> 24:28.816
Wait, are you
still riffing?

24:29.983 --> 24:31.483
I don't know.

24:32.358 --> 24:34.150
Richard, here's the bad news,

24:34.150 --> 24:35.816
your arms and your torso

24:35.816 --> 24:37.441
took the brunt of the glass.

24:37.441 --> 24:38.816
If you'd cut your face up some,

24:38.816 --> 24:41.317
we could've gotten insurance
to pay for a whole remodel.

24:41.317 --> 24:42.358
Gotta, you know...

24:42.358 --> 24:44.150
give the old schnozzle
a much-needed trim,

24:44.150 --> 24:45.608
you know
what I'm talking about.

24:45.608 --> 24:47.733
You gotta hate it
as much as everybody else.

24:48.649 --> 24:50.108
So what happened?
What were you,

24:50.108 --> 24:51.649
trying to ride one
of those hover boards

24:51.649 --> 24:53.399
around your office
like a nincompoop?

24:53.399 --> 24:55.192
Um, no.

24:55.192 --> 24:57.733
I-- I guess I just got
a little lost in the work.

25:00.192 --> 25:02.150
All right.
Hop in, Frankenstein.

25:02.150 --> 25:03.483
Let's get you out of here.

25:03.483 --> 25:05.317
Oh, uh...

25:05.317 --> 25:07.233
I think what
you're trying to say is

25:07.233 --> 25:08.524
Frankenstein's monster.

25:08.524 --> 25:09.816
What?

25:09.816 --> 25:11.983
I think you mean to call me
Frankenstein's monster

25:11.983 --> 25:12.983
'cause Frankenstein is the--

25:12.983 --> 25:14.275
Oh, you're one
of those guys, huh?

25:14.275 --> 25:16.566
No, I'm just--
the doctor's name
is Frankenstein--

25:16.566 --> 25:18.524
I know.
It's just an annoying thing
to point out.

25:18.524 --> 25:20.900
If you want
people to like you,

25:20.900 --> 25:22.566
just go along
with what they say
and have fun.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.358
Richard:
What?

25:28.358 --> 25:29.483
Jared:
Richard!

25:29.483 --> 25:32.108
You should've called.
I would've picked you up.

25:32.108 --> 25:33.816
What's everybody doing here?

25:33.816 --> 25:35.192
The fuck does it look like?

25:35.192 --> 25:36.192
We're working.

25:36.192 --> 25:37.399
Look at 'em all, Richard.

25:37.399 --> 25:39.900
I mean, sure,
a three-day orientation

25:39.900 --> 25:41.733
might've been
just as effective
and less bloody,

25:41.733 --> 25:42.983
but it wasn't you.

25:42.983 --> 25:44.816
But you found your own way

25:44.816 --> 25:49.233
to get these men and women,
these Pipers, to follow you.

25:49.233 --> 25:50.691
You looked at these people
and you said,

25:50.691 --> 25:52.566
"I may not be
an inspiring speaker.

25:52.566 --> 25:55.067
"I may be twitchy,

25:55.067 --> 25:56.775
"and I might be strange,

25:56.775 --> 25:59.233
"and I might vomit
and I might defecate in my pants

25:59.233 --> 26:01.358
"and I might throw
myself through a window.

26:01.358 --> 26:02.941
"But I believe in
this company so much,

26:02.941 --> 26:06.025
I'll work so hard,
I'll literally
risk my life for it."

26:06.025 --> 26:09.233
And that is the kind of leader
these people wanna follow.

26:09.233 --> 26:12.483
Because now they know
nothing is gonna stop you.

26:12.483 --> 26:13.775
All right, then.

26:22.108 --> 26:24.233
Gavin Belson's office, please?

26:24.233 --> 26:26.858
I need to talk to Hoover.
It's Jeff Washburn.

26:26.858 --> 26:28.441
Yes, thank you.

26:28.441 --> 26:30.649
This one came in third
with 46 votes.

26:30.649 --> 26:32.941
Cute. Next?

26:34.150 --> 26:37.233
This one came in second
with 374 votes.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.233
Nice, feels solid.

26:40.608 --> 26:43.483
And with 9,986 votes this,

26:43.483 --> 26:45.941
by far, was Hooli's favorite.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.108
Gavin:
Hmm, I like it.

26:55.233 --> 26:56.441
It's bold.

26:56.441 --> 26:59.067
Gavin B.

27:00.108 --> 27:02.025
Mr. Hoover?
You have a phone call.

27:02.025 --> 27:03.566
He said you'd know
what it was regarding.

27:03.566 --> 27:05.150
A Mr. Jeff Washburn.

27:08.941 --> 27:11.025
I am so exhausted.

27:11.025 --> 27:12.483
But the backseat of my Tesla's

27:12.483 --> 27:14.150
really comfy though,
right, Richard?

27:14.150 --> 27:16.816
Definitely worth all
the money I'm spending on it.

27:16.816 --> 27:18.233
Good purchase.

27:18.233 --> 27:19.608
Not a mistake.

27:19.608 --> 27:21.275
Uh...

27:21.275 --> 27:22.733
my key doesn't work.

27:22.733 --> 27:24.483
Uh, let me try mine.

27:27.399 --> 27:28.441
What the fuck?

27:28.441 --> 27:29.691
Mine doesn't work either.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.524
Yang. Move.

27:33.441 --> 27:34.691
Do you have a app idea?

27:34.691 --> 27:36.025
No.

27:36.025 --> 27:39.566
Sorry. Errich is gone.

27:39.566 --> 27:41.691
This is my incubator now.

27:41.691 --> 27:43.025
What?

27:43.025 --> 27:45.025
Your things are over there.

27:46.358 --> 27:47.733
Richard:

Gilfoyle,

you are racist.

27:52.691 --> 27:53.858
And Richard...

27:54.941 --> 27:55.983
you are ugly.

27:55.983 --> 27:59.192
The Errich administration
is over.

27:59.192 --> 28:00.192
What?
What the fuck?

28:00.192 --> 28:02.025
You can't just
kick us out, Jian-Yang.

28:02.025 --> 28:06.358
Sorry. You are victims
of a circumstance.

28:06.358 --> 28:07.524
Thank you.
