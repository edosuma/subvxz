00:15.342 --> 00:18.901
In this picture
there are 47 people.

00:18.982 --> 00:21.262
None of them can be seen.

00:21.341 --> 00:23.221
In this film,
we hope to show you...

00:23.302 --> 00:25.462
how not to be seen.

00:27.062 --> 00:30.501
This is Mr. E. R. Bradshaw
of Napier Court...

00:30.582 --> 00:33.621
Blackline Road, London, SE 14.

00:33.702 --> 00:35.742
He cannot be seen.

00:35.782 --> 00:37.701
Now I'm going to ask him
to stand up.

00:37.782 --> 00:40.581
Mr. Bradshaw,
will you stand up, please?

00:46.341 --> 00:49.702
This demonstrates
the value of not being seen.

00:49.781 --> 00:53.541
In this picture, we cannot see
Mrs. B. J. Smegma...

00:53.620 --> 00:56.262
of 13 The Crescent, Belmont.

00:56.301 --> 00:59.262
Mrs. Smegma,
will you stand up, please?

01:04.700 --> 01:08.862
This is Mr. Nesbitt
of Harlow. Newtown.

01:08.901 --> 01:11.582
Mr. Nesbitt,
will you stand up, please?

01:15.622 --> 01:19.342
Mr. Nesbitt has learned
the first lesson of not being seen:

01:19.421 --> 01:21.462
not to stand up.

01:21.542 --> 01:25.181
However, he has chosen
a very obvious piece of cover.

01:27.662 --> 01:31.581
Mr. E. W. Lambert of Homely,
The Burrows. Oswald Street...

01:31.662 --> 01:33.662
has presented us with a poser.

01:33.702 --> 01:36.582
We do not know
which bush he is behind.

01:36.622 --> 01:38.661
But we can soon find out.

01:47.702 --> 01:50.501
Yes. It was the middle one.

01:51.182 --> 01:53.821
Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Hull...

01:53.862 --> 01:56.261
chose a very cunning way
of not being seen.

01:56.302 --> 02:00.182
When we called at their house, we found
they had gone on two weeks holiday.

02:00.262 --> 02:02.942
However, a neighbor told us
where they were.

02:05.262 --> 02:08.262
And here is the neighbor
who told us where they were.

02:11.822 --> 02:13.702
And here is where he lived.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.261
And this is
where he was born.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.702
And now for something
completely different.

03:28.902 --> 03:31.302
Oh. Good evening.

03:31.342 --> 03:33.422
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:33.501 --> 03:38.461
we apologize that the feature was
not quite as long as we'd anticipated.

03:38.502 --> 03:40.862
Therefore,
there will be a short interval.

03:45.862 --> 03:50.061
In the meantime, we are pleased
to be able to show you a short film...

03:50.142 --> 03:52.941
starring a man
with a tape recorder up his nose.

04:25.102 --> 04:28.542
And now... And now
a film starring a man...

04:28.581 --> 04:31.461
with a tape recorder
up his brother's nose.

04:55.661 --> 04:58.022
And now in stereo

05:17.742 --> 05:20.302
Thank you.
That is the end of the interval.

05:20.382 --> 05:22.502
Will you kindly return
to your seats?

05:22.582 --> 05:25.861
We will now be proceeding
with the program as advertised.

05:30.022 --> 05:31.902
Darling, you were wonderful.

05:31.941 --> 05:34.181
Oh, really?

05:34.381 --> 05:39.261
In 1971 the British Empire
lay in ruins.

05:39.302 --> 05:42.982
Foreigners frequented the streets,
many of them Hungarians.

05:43.062 --> 05:45.262
Not the streets.
The foreign nationals.

05:45.341 --> 05:50.342
Anyway, many of these Hungarians went
into tobacconist's to buy cigarettes.

05:50.382 --> 05:52.741
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

05:57.381 --> 05:59.222
Good morning, sir.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.502
"I will not buy this record.
It is scratched. "

06:04.581 --> 06:06.542
I'm sorry?

06:06.622 --> 06:10.302
I will not buy this record.
It is scratched. "

06:10.341 --> 06:13.902
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a tobacconist's.

06:13.981 --> 06:15.421
Tobacconist's.

06:17.421 --> 06:20.741
"I will not buy this tobacconist's.
It is scratched. "

06:20.822 --> 06:23.621
No. Tobacco.
Um, cigarettes.

06:23.702 --> 06:25.061
Cigarettes?

06:29.062 --> 06:32.742
- "My hovercraft is full of eels. "
- What?

06:32.783 --> 06:35.781
"My hovercraft
is full of eels. "

06:36.942 --> 06:39.822
- Ah, matches.
- Yeah! Matches.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.942
- "Do you want... "
- "Do you want. "

06:44.022 --> 06:45.462
Want.

06:45.542 --> 06:50.181
"Do you want to come back to my place?
Bouncy, bouncy. "

06:50.261 --> 06:52.222
That'll be
six shillings, please.

06:52.261 --> 06:57.182
"If I said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?"

06:57.261 --> 06:59.461
"I am no longer infected. "

06:59.542 --> 07:01.382
May I?

07:02.302 --> 07:04.942
Costs six shillings.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.222
Help!

07:30.062 --> 07:34.181
- What's all this. Then?
- "You have beautiful thighs. "

07:34.222 --> 07:35.741
- What?
- He hit me.

07:35.822 --> 07:39.381
"Drop your panties, Sir Arthur.
I can not wait till lunchtime!"

07:39.462 --> 07:42.782
- Right!
- "Oh, my nipples explode with delight!"

07:42.862 --> 07:45.302
The Hungarian gentleman
was subsequently released...

07:45.381 --> 07:48.982
but his information led to the arrest
and trial of the real culprit.

07:49.062 --> 07:50.262
I am.

07:50.341 --> 07:53.221
You are hereby charged
that on the 28th day of May...

07:53.301 --> 07:55.942
you did will fully
and with malice aforethought...

07:56.022 --> 07:58.942
publish an alleged
English-Hungarian phrase book...

07:59.022 --> 08:01.983
with intent to cause
a breach of the peace.

08:02.022 --> 08:05.222
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.102
Mr. York, on the 28th of May...

08:08.141 --> 08:11.742
- you published this phrase book.
- I did.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.942
With Your Lordship's permission,
I would like to quote an example.

08:14.982 --> 08:19.622
The Hungarian phrase meaning, "Can you
direct me to the railway station?"...

08:19.702 --> 08:22.622
is here translated
by the English phrase...

08:22.662 --> 08:25.102
"Please fondle my buttocks. "

08:28.741 --> 08:30.902
"Please fondle...

08:30.982 --> 08:33.102
my buttocks. "

08:33.182 --> 08:35.020
Ah, yes.
It's past the post office...

08:35.101 --> 08:37.501
200 yards down
and then left at the light.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.382
Left at lights.

09:44.782 --> 09:46.782
Meanwhile, not far away...

09:46.821 --> 09:51.021
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey were
about to enter an unfamiliar office.

09:51.102 --> 09:52.542
Next.

10:15.342 --> 10:19.262
Oh. Are you the marriage
guidance counselor?

10:19.302 --> 10:22.182
- Yes. Good morning.
- Morning.

10:24.781 --> 10:28.621
And... good morning
to you, madam.

10:30.982 --> 10:34.620
- Name?
- Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey.

10:36.782 --> 10:41.581
And what is the name of your...
ravishing wife?

10:41.662 --> 10:43.942
Wait. Don't tell me.

10:43.982 --> 10:47.422
It's... It's something
to do with moonlight.

10:48.462 --> 10:50.702
Goes with her eyes.

10:50.782 --> 10:52.822
It's soft and gentle...

10:52.902 --> 10:55.222
warm and yielding.

10:55.301 --> 10:57.142
Deeply lyrical, and yet...

10:57.222 --> 11:00.542
tender and frightened,
like a tiny, white rabbit.

11:00.582 --> 11:02.342
It's Dierdre.

11:05.662 --> 11:07.502
What a beautiful name.

11:09.382 --> 11:11.221
What a beautiful...

11:12.461 --> 11:14.341
beautiful name.

11:17.981 --> 11:21.061
And what seems to be the trouble
with your marriage, Mr. Putey?

11:21.102 --> 11:23.862
It started when we went
to Brighton on holiday together.

11:23.941 --> 11:26.783
Dierdre - that's my wife - and I,
we've always been close companions...

11:26.862 --> 11:29.742
and I never particularly
anticipated any marital strife.

11:29.821 --> 11:32.341
The very idea of consulting
a professional marital advisor...

11:32.422 --> 11:34.341
has always been of
the greatest repugnance to me.

11:34.422 --> 11:38.742
Although, far be it from me
to impugn the nature of your trade or...

11:38.822 --> 11:40.661
or profession.

11:43.142 --> 11:46.421
- Do go on.
- We've always been close companions...

11:46.501 --> 11:50.102
sharing the interests,
the gardening, the holiday money.

11:50.181 --> 11:53.902
Twice a month of an evening, we settle
down to do the accounts together...

11:53.982 --> 11:57.502
something which Dierdre -
that's my wife -

11:57.542 --> 12:00.422
and I particularly look forward to
on account of her feet.

12:00.502 --> 12:04.262
I should have said at the start that
I noted for having a grand sense of humor.

12:04.302 --> 12:08.222
Although I've kept myself very much
to myself over the last couple of years.

12:08.301 --> 12:11.902
It's only been as comparatively recently
as recently that I've begun to realize-

12:11.941 --> 12:14.462
Well, perhaps "realize"
is too strong a word.

12:14.542 --> 12:19.622
Uh, imagine that, uh,
I was not the only thing in her life.

12:19.662 --> 12:21.742
You suspected your wife?

12:21.822 --> 12:23.182
Well...

12:25.341 --> 12:27.781
frankly, yes.

12:27.862 --> 12:29.981
A bit.

12:30.022 --> 12:32.421
Her behavior did seem to me-

12:32.462 --> 12:35.582
Her behavior did seem to me.
who was there to see...

12:35.621 --> 12:38.060
to be a little odd.

12:38.142 --> 12:39.662
- Odd?
- To an extent.

12:39.742 --> 12:42.022
I'm not by nature
a suspicious person.

12:42.102 --> 12:45.862
I've got a reputation of an after-dinner
speaker, if you get my meaning.

12:45.942 --> 12:47.382
I certainly do.

12:47.461 --> 12:50.781
And in the area where people know me,
I'm very well known.

12:50.822 --> 12:53.302
- Fine. Would you-
- Certainly.

12:53.382 --> 12:56.262
It was time to face the facts,
stop beating about the bush...

12:56.342 --> 12:58.942
or I'd never be able to look myself
in the bathroom mirror again.

12:58.981 --> 13:03.102
Would you mind running along for 10-
make it 20 minutes. All right?

13:03.142 --> 13:05.542
Yes. I'll wait outside,
shall I?

13:09.381 --> 13:12.822
Yes, that-that's perhaps
the best thing.

13:12.901 --> 13:16.901
Certainly set my mind at rest
on one or two scores there.

13:33.022 --> 13:34.782
Arthur Putey!

13:35.782 --> 13:39.422
Are you a man or a mouse?

13:39.461 --> 13:42.101
You've been running too long,
Arthur Putey.

13:42.182 --> 13:47.262
It's time to stop, time to turn
and fight like a man.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.782
Go back in there,
Arthur Putey.

13:49.861 --> 13:53.941
Go back in there
and pull your finger out.

13:54.022 --> 13:56.862
Yes! Yes, you're right.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.622
This is it, Arthur Putey!

13:59.700 --> 14:02.862
This is your moment,
Arthur Putey!

14:02.942 --> 14:05.942
At last you're a man!

14:10.462 --> 14:12.662
Come out of there. Dierdre!
I know you're in there.

14:12.741 --> 14:15.262
- Go away!
- Righto.

14:41.741 --> 14:44.022
Oh, what a lovely little

14:53.502 --> 14:55.781
Oh, what a lovely little-

15:05.702 --> 15:09.181
- Oh, what a lovely little-
- Stop it! Stop right there!

15:09.262 --> 15:13.102
This is absolutely disgusting,
and I'm not going to stand for it!

15:13.182 --> 15:15.062
There. Kill

16:11.221 --> 16:14.981
Cut! That's it. We're not going to allow
this sort of smut on the screen.

16:15.022 --> 16:18.022
This depraved and degrading spectacle
is going to stop right now.

16:18.101 --> 16:21.501
- Do you hear me? Stop it!
- Damn I Just when it was getting good.

16:28.742 --> 16:30.622
Evening, squire.

16:42.942 --> 16:44.262
You married?

16:45.342 --> 16:48.501
- Yes.
- I'm a bachelor myself.

16:48.582 --> 16:50.941
Is- Is your wife a goer?

16:50.982 --> 16:53.022
Eh? Know what I mean?
Nudge, nudge.

16:53.062 --> 16:55.422
- Know what I mean? Say no more.
- I beg your pardon?

16:55.461 --> 17:00.063
Your wife, does she go? Eh?
Know what I mean? Does she go?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.622
- She sometimes goes.
- I'll bet she does.

17:02.702 --> 17:05.502
Say no more.
Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.300
- I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
- Follow me.

17:08.382 --> 17:12.381
That's good. A nod's as good
as a wink to a blind bat.

17:12.462 --> 17:16.582
- Look, are you selling something?
- Selling. Selling. Very good.

17:16.621 --> 17:18.742
Know what I mean?

17:18.820 --> 17:21.982
Oh, wicked. You're wicked, eh?
Nudge, nudge.

17:22.021 --> 17:24.901
A nod's as good as a wink
to a blind bat.

17:24.982 --> 17:28.262
- But...
- Your wife a sport, eh?

17:28.340 --> 17:32.142
- She likes sport, yes.
- I bet she does.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.142
She's very fond of cricket.

17:34.181 --> 17:36.823
Who isn't, eh?
Likes games.

17:36.902 --> 17:39.262
Knew she would.
Who doesn't. Eh?

17:39.343 --> 17:41.261
She's been around a bit. Eh?

17:41.342 --> 17:43.261
She's traveled.
She's from Purley.

17:43.342 --> 17:45.901
Oh! Say no more.

17:48.382 --> 17:50.382
Know what I mean?
Say no more.

17:52.862 --> 17:56.741
Your wife interested in,
uh, photography, eh?

17:56.822 --> 18:00.181
"Photographs, eh?"
he asked him knowingly.

18:00.262 --> 18:03.422
- Photography?
- Yeah. Snap. Grin. Wink. Nudge.

18:03.462 --> 18:06.821
- Holiday stamps?
- Could be taken on holiday. Could be.

18:06.902 --> 18:09.542
Swimming costumes.
Nudge, nudge.

18:09.622 --> 18:13.182
- Candid photography.
- No. I'm afraid we don't have a camera.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.102
Oh. Still.

18:19.341 --> 18:21.541
Look, are you trying
to insinuate something?

18:24.421 --> 18:26.982
- Yes.
- Well?

18:27.061 --> 18:29.782
Well, I mean,
you're a man of the world, aren't ya?

18:29.862 --> 18:33.462
I mean, you know, you've, uh...
you've been around. You've been there.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.701
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, you've...

18:36.742 --> 18:39.221
You've done it, uh, with a lady.

18:39.302 --> 18:42.101
- You've slept with a lady.
- Yes.

18:43.221 --> 18:44.502
What's it like?

18:45.502 --> 18:47.942
Well, I think it's overrated.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.142
Shut up, you!

18:52.902 --> 18:55.902
- Good evening, class!
- Good evening.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.342
- Where's all the others, then?
- They're not here.

18:58.422 --> 19:01.422
I can see that!
What's the matter with'em?

19:01.502 --> 19:03.461
- Don't know.
- Perhaps they've got flu.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.661
Flu! They should eat
more fresh fruit!

19:09.981 --> 19:12.861
Right! Now, self-defense!

19:12.942 --> 19:16.142
Tonight I shall be carryin' on
from where we got to last week...

19:16.222 --> 19:20.542
when I was showin' you how to
defend yourselves against anyone...

19:20.582 --> 19:24.422
who attacks you armed
with a piece of fresh fruit.

19:25.782 --> 19:29.062
- You said we wouldn't do fruit again.
- What do you mean?

19:29.102 --> 19:31.422
We've done fresh fruit
for the last nine weeks.

19:31.461 --> 19:35.022
What's wrong with fruit?
You think you know it all, eh?

19:35.101 --> 19:36.621
Can't we try something else?

19:36.702 --> 19:38.862
Like someone who attacks you
with a pointed stick.

19:38.942 --> 19:40.782
Pointed stick?

19:42.941 --> 19:47.422
We want to learn how to defend ourselves
against pointed sticks, do we?

19:47.462 --> 19:50.342
Gettin' all
high and mighty, eh?

19:50.381 --> 19:53.182
Fresh fruit not
good enough for you, eh?

19:54.221 --> 19:56.702
Well, let me tell you
somethin', my lad!

19:56.781 --> 20:00.382
When you're walkin' home tonight
and some great homicidal maniac...

20:00.421 --> 20:05.262
comes after you with a bunch of
loganberries, don't come cryin' to me!

20:05.342 --> 20:09.542
Right!
And now the passion fruit.

20:09.582 --> 20:13.342
When your assailant lunges at you
with a passion fruit, like thus-

20:13.380 --> 20:16.102
- We done the passion fruit.
- What?

20:16.182 --> 20:20.262
- We've done the passion fruit.
- We done oranges, apples, grapefruits...

20:20.341 --> 20:24.341
- Whole and segments.
- Greengages, pomegranates.

20:24.421 --> 20:26.823
- Grapes, passion fruit.
- Lemons.

20:26.902 --> 20:30.662
- Plums.
- And mangoes in syrup.

20:30.702 --> 20:33.342
- How about cherries?
- We done them.

20:33.381 --> 20:35.542
- Red and black?
- Yes.

20:36.582 --> 20:38.462
All right, then.

20:40.901 --> 20:44.221
Bananas. We haven't
done bananas, have we?

20:44.262 --> 20:46.461
- No.
- Right!

20:46.502 --> 20:50.541
How to defend yourself
against a man armed with a banana!

20:50.622 --> 20:55.462
Catch. Now, it's quite simple
to deal with a banana fiend.

20:55.542 --> 20:59.022
First of all, you force him
to drop the banana.

20:59.102 --> 21:02.701
Then you eat the banana,
thus disarming him.

21:02.782 --> 21:04.622
You have now
rendered him helpless!

21:04.702 --> 21:07.581
- Suppose he's got a bunch.
- Shut up.

21:07.622 --> 21:10.581
- Suppose he's got a pointed stick.
- Shut up!

21:11.622 --> 21:13.822
Right! Now you, Mr. Apricot.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.382
- Harrison.
- Sorry. Mr. Harrison.

21:16.462 --> 21:18.382
Come at me with that banana.

21:18.462 --> 21:22.902
Be as vicious as you like with it.
Come on. Attack me!

21:22.982 --> 21:25.542
No, no, no!
Put something into it, for God's...

21:25.621 --> 21:27.941
Hold the banana like that.

21:28.022 --> 21:30.381
That's better.
Now scream.

21:30.461 --> 21:32.701
Good. Right.
Now attack me.

21:32.742 --> 21:35.142
Come on, man,
attack me!

21:39.101 --> 21:41.421
Next, I eat the banana.

21:44.502 --> 21:47.022
Now, I would just like
to point out...

21:47.102 --> 21:51.102
that this film is displaying
a distinct tendency to become silly.

21:51.182 --> 21:55.222
Now, nobody likes
a good laugh more than I do.

21:55.302 --> 21:59.141
Except, perhaps,
my wife and some of her friends.

21:59.221 --> 22:00.942
Oh, yes,
and Captain John son.

22:01.021 --> 22:03.781
Come to think of it, most people
like a good laugh more than I do.

22:03.862 --> 22:08.142
But that's beside the point. I'm warning
this film not to get silly again.

22:08.222 --> 22:12.621
Right. Now, Director,
on the command "Cut"...

22:12.702 --> 22:14.902
cut to the next scene.

22:14.982 --> 22:17.982
- Director...
- This is a frightened city.

22:18.022 --> 22:20.502
Wait for itl

22:20.581 --> 22:22.822
Director, cut!

22:22.981 --> 22:25.461
This is a frightened city.

22:25.542 --> 22:29.502
Over these streets, over these houses,
hangs a pall of fear.

22:29.541 --> 22:33.101
An ugly kind of violence is rife,
stalking the town.

22:36.102 --> 22:40.342
Yes, gangs of old ladies
attacking fit, defenseless young men.

23:02.342 --> 23:04.821
They just come up to you
and push you, like.

23:04.902 --> 23:09.021
Shove you off the pavement. There's
usually about four or five of them.

23:09.062 --> 23:12.422
Yeah, sometimes
it's three or four of them.

23:12.502 --> 23:16.182
It's not even safe to go out
down to the shops anymore.

23:17.302 --> 23:21.622
Grannies are no respecter
of race, creed or sex.

23:21.702 --> 23:24.142
Theirs is a harsh.
ruthless world...

23:24.222 --> 23:27.982
a tough world, a world in which
the surgical stocking is king.

23:29.302 --> 23:31.982
But what are they in it for,
these senile delinquents...

23:32.061 --> 23:34.342
these layabouts in lace?

23:34.381 --> 23:37.461
- Oh, the violence.
- The prestige, mainly.

23:37.542 --> 23:40.742
- The free gifts.
- Poking the knee in the groin.

23:40.822 --> 23:43.101
We like pulling the heads
off sheep.

23:43.142 --> 23:45.902
And tea cakes.

23:45.981 --> 23:49.262
We have a lot of trouble with grannies.
Pension day is the worst.

23:49.342 --> 23:51.142
Soon as they get it,
they blow the lot...

23:51.222 --> 23:54.501
on milk, tea, sugar,
a tin of meat for their cat.

23:54.582 --> 23:57.422
The whole crux
of the problem, uh...

23:57.501 --> 24:00.381
lies in the basic
dissatisfaction...

24:00.422 --> 24:04.262
of these senile delinquents
with the world as they find it.

24:04.341 --> 24:07.541
They begin to question, uh,
the values of their society.

24:07.622 --> 24:09.781
They see their sons
and daughters growing up...

24:09.861 --> 24:13.981
to become accountants, uh,
solicitors, sociologists even.

24:14.022 --> 24:16.861
And they begin to wonder,
"Is it all worth it? Is it all... "

24:28.182 --> 24:31.942
Another prime target for vandalism
is telephone boxes.

24:34.661 --> 24:36.541
But mostly,
they just live for kicks.

24:49.542 --> 24:52.261
But there are other kinds
of violence abroad...

24:52.341 --> 24:54.702
other gangs, equally vicious,
equally determined...

24:54.781 --> 24:56.622
such as the baby snatchers.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.942
Hey What is this?

25:03.022 --> 25:05.102
Hey! Help!

25:05.181 --> 25:08.982
I left him outside for a few moments
while I got some Brillo Pads.

25:09.060 --> 25:12.622
When I came back, he was gone.
He was only 48!

25:12.702 --> 25:16.222
And also vicious gangs
of "Keep Left" signs.

25:21.982 --> 25:23.822
Right! Stop that!

25:23.903 --> 25:26.502
It's silly.
Very silly, indeed.

25:26.582 --> 25:30.181
It started off as a nice little idea
about old ladies attacking young men...

25:30.262 --> 25:32.422
but now it's just got silly.

25:32.462 --> 25:34.462
His hair's too long
for a vicar too.

25:34.501 --> 25:38.902
And you can tell those are not proper
"Keep Left" signs. Clear off, the lot of you!

25:38.982 --> 25:40.821
You, come with me.

25:44.221 --> 25:48.942
Right. Now let's see something decent
and military: some precision drilling.

25:49.022 --> 25:52.142
Squad! Camp it up!

25:53.222 --> 25:55.142
Ooh, get her! Whoops!

25:55.181 --> 26:00.222
I've got your number, but you
couldn't afford me, dear, two, three.

26:00.261 --> 26:02.662
I'll scratch your eyes out.

26:02.701 --> 26:06.021
Don't come the bigger
dear bitch with us. dear.

26:06.062 --> 26:10.221
We all know where you've been,
you military fairy, two, three.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.942
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

26:13.022 --> 26:15.342
Whoops!
Don't look now, girls.

26:15.421 --> 26:18.702
The maid is just mince
in that jolly color, Sergeant.

26:18.782 --> 26:20.782
Two, three. Ooh!

26:22.061 --> 26:24.542
Right! Stop that. Silly.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.902
And a bit suspect, I think.
Time for a cartoon.

26:29.261 --> 26:31.422
Once upon a time...

26:31.461 --> 26:34.021
there was an enchanted prince...

26:34.102 --> 26:36.901
who ruled the land
beyond the Wobbles.

26:38.942 --> 26:43.741
One day he discovered
a spot on his face.

26:44.621 --> 26:46.702
Foolishly, he ignored it.

26:46.782 --> 26:50.462
And three years later,
he died of cancer.

26:50.501 --> 26:52.381
The spot, however, flourished...

26:52.422 --> 26:55.261
and soon set out
to seek its fortune.

27:28.382 --> 27:31.462
Agnes, did you just see
who moved in next door?

27:31.502 --> 27:34.462
Yes. Black as the ace of spades,
they were.

27:34.502 --> 27:37.262
Oh, well,
there goes the neighborhood.

27:37.342 --> 27:39.181
Oh, yes.

27:58.342 --> 28:00.222
Next, please.

28:03.022 --> 28:04.902
One at a time, please.

28:06.343 --> 28:08.303
There is only me, sir.

28:13.382 --> 28:16.021
So there is.
Take a, um...

28:17.502 --> 28:20.382
- Seat?
- Seat. Take a seat.

28:20.421 --> 28:24.062
So, you want to join
my mountaineering expedition, do you?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.222
Who, me, sir?

28:28.262 --> 28:31.462
- Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.
- Jolly good.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.342
And how about you?

28:35.581 --> 28:38.222
There is only me, sir.

28:43.662 --> 28:47.101
Well, bang goes
his application then.

28:47.182 --> 28:50.103
Now, let me fill you in.
I'm leading this expedition...

28:50.181 --> 28:54.142
and we're going to climb
both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.

28:54.222 --> 28:56.902
I thought there was
only one peak, sir.

29:08.582 --> 29:12.142
Well. That I save a bit of time.
Well done.

29:12.222 --> 29:14.981
Now, the object of
this year's expedition...

29:15.022 --> 29:18.462
is to see if we can find any trace
of last year's expedition.

29:18.501 --> 29:21.260
- Last year's expedition?
- Yes. My brother was leading that.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.621
They were going to build a bridge
between the two peaks.

29:29.982 --> 29:31.862
My idea, I'm afraid.

29:31.942 --> 29:34.981
I ought to tell you that I have almost
everyone I need for this expedition.

29:35.062 --> 29:37.741
But what special qualifications
do you have?

29:37.822 --> 29:40.301
- Well, sir...
- Yes, you first.

29:40.382 --> 29:42.542
- There is only me, sir.
- I wasn't talking to you.

29:42.621 --> 29:46.542
- Carry on.
- I'm a fully qualified mountaineer.

29:48.342 --> 29:50.182
Mountaineer?

29:55.262 --> 29:57.942
Mouse. Moun...

29:58.022 --> 30:02.421
Mountaineer: two men skilled
at climbing a mountain.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.021
By Jove, that'd be useful.

30:05.061 --> 30:08.181
Well, you're in.
Congratulations.

30:08.262 --> 30:10.982
Both of you.
Now, what are your names?

30:11.022 --> 30:12.902
Arthur Wilson.

30:15.141 --> 30:16.502
Well, look.

30:16.581 --> 30:19.781
I'll call you Arthur Wilson One
and you Arthur Wilson Two...

30:19.822 --> 30:21.702
just to avoid confusion.

30:21.742 --> 30:23.862
Are you actually leading
this expedition?

30:23.942 --> 30:26.622
Yes, we are leading
this expedition to Africa.

30:26.661 --> 30:29.981
- What routes will you both be following?
- Good questions.

30:30.022 --> 30:33.662
We'll be leaving on one or other
of the January the 22...

30:33.702 --> 30:35.821
and taking the following routes:

30:35.902 --> 30:38.302
from Manchesters,
down through Oxfords...

30:38.342 --> 30:41.221
taking the M1.5
through Londons to Purleys...

30:41.261 --> 30:44.182
then the A25s
from Purleys to Dovers.

30:44.262 --> 30:46.901
Thence Africas to Nairobis.

30:46.982 --> 30:51.421
We take the south roads out of Nairobis
for about 12 miles and then ask.

30:51.462 --> 30:54.462
- Does anyone speak Swahili?
- Most of them do down there.

30:54.541 --> 30:57.301
No. Does anyone in our party
speak Swahili, sir?

30:57.381 --> 31:00.102
- Well, Matron's got a smattering.
- Apart from the two Matrons.

31:00.181 --> 31:02.501
Good Lord.
I forgot about her.

31:02.542 --> 31:05.021
Apart from them, who else
is coming on our expedition?

31:05.102 --> 31:08.182
Well, we've got
the Arthur Brown twins,...

31:08.262 --> 31:11.661
two botanists called Madchen,
the William Johnston brothers...

31:11.742 --> 31:14.622
- Two of them.
- Four. Pair of identical twins.

31:14.661 --> 31:17.382
Two of the Harry Baker quads
and you two.

31:18.062 --> 31:21.222
- And none of these are mountaineers?
- Well, you two are.

31:21.262 --> 31:23.862
And we've got a brace of guides
called Jimmy Blankensoft...

31:23.941 --> 31:27.141
because Kilimanjaro
is a pretty tricky climb.

31:27.182 --> 31:30.182
Most of it's up,
till we reach the very top...

31:30.261 --> 31:32.742
and then it tends
to slope away rather sharply.

31:32.821 --> 31:36.302
But Jimmy's put his heads together
and worked out a way up. Jimmy

31:37.901 --> 31:40.981
Jimmy Blankensoft, Arthur Wilson.
Arthur Wilson, Jimmy Blankensoft.

31:41.062 --> 31:42.622
Jimmy Blankensoft Two,
Arthur Wilson Two.

31:42.662 --> 31:44.861
Arthur Wilson Two,
Jimmy Blankensoft One.

31:44.902 --> 31:48.102
- Carry on, Jimmy.
- Don't worry about the...

31:48.181 --> 31:50.342
We'll get him up, all right.

31:56.422 --> 32:00.862
Well, I'd better describe the route.
We start off simply up Kilimanjaro...

32:03.462 --> 32:05.941
Quite simple.
No problem there, basically.

32:06.022 --> 32:10.222
And then we go on to
the main face itself of Kilimanjaro.

32:10.301 --> 32:12.621
It's a bit difficult
here because...

32:16.902 --> 32:19.222
There's a difficult bit 'round here
when you've got to go...

32:19.302 --> 32:22.622
from the end of the mantel-piece
onto the coffee table.

32:22.662 --> 32:25.622
It's a bit of a difficult jump.
We don't need those.

32:25.702 --> 32:29.221
Then you've got the rail up here,
which is quite a good fortune.

32:29.302 --> 32:33.342
There's a terribly easy bit
over the floor up onto the chair.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.382
And then we've got...

32:37.061 --> 32:39.102
We get down.
We go quite simplistic.

32:43.622 --> 32:45.622
He'll be leading
the first assault.

32:45.701 --> 32:48.222
I'm afraid I shan't be coming
on your expedition, sir...

32:48.301 --> 32:52.582
'cause I have absolutely no confidence
in anyone involved in it!

32:54.661 --> 32:56.101
Oh. dear.

32:57.823 --> 33:00.102
- What about you?
- I'm game, sir.

33:00.142 --> 33:02.022
Jolly good.

33:04.501 --> 33:05.662
Good Lord!

33:32.261 --> 33:34.141
And now for something
completely different.

33:34.301 --> 33:36.382
- Inspector!
- Yes, sir?

33:36.422 --> 33:38.942
I was sitting on a park bench
and I put my coat down.

33:38.982 --> 33:43.101
When I picked it up, I found my wallet
had gone and £15 had been stolen.

33:43.142 --> 33:46.541
- Did you see anyone?
- No, no one at all.

33:48.582 --> 33:51.222
Well, there's very little
we can do about that, sir.

34:00.422 --> 34:02.822
Do you want to come back
to my place?

34:07.062 --> 34:08.981
Yeah, all right.

34:45.022 --> 34:47.820
And so Miss Spume
returned to her typing...

34:47.902 --> 34:49.942
and dreamed
her little dreamy dreams...

34:50.021 --> 34:53.981
unaware of the cruel trick
fate had in store for her.

34:54.062 --> 34:56.422
For Miss Spume was
about to fall victim...

34:56.501 --> 35:00.703
of the dreaded international
Chinese communist conspiracy

35:00.742 --> 35:02.942
Yes, these fanatical fiends...

35:02.981 --> 35:06.542
under the leadership
of the so-called Mao Tse-tung...

35:06.621 --> 35:10.742
had caught Miss Spume off guard
for one brief but fatal moment...

35:13.261 --> 35:15.141
and destroyed her...

35:16.302 --> 35:19.622
just as they are ready to go
anytime free men anywhere...

35:19.702 --> 35:22.382
waver in their defense
of democracy.

35:31.501 --> 35:33.862
Once again, American defense...

35:33.902 --> 35:36.941
proves its effectiveness
against international communism.

35:37.022 --> 35:40.222
Using this diagram of a tooth
to represent any small country...

35:40.261 --> 35:42.581
we can see how
international communism works...

35:42.662 --> 35:45.102
by eroding away from within.

35:49.861 --> 35:51.702
When one country, or tooth...

35:51.782 --> 35:56.342
falls victim to international communism,
its neighbors soon follow.

35:56.421 --> 35:59.821
In dentistry, this is known
as the domino theory.

35:59.902 --> 36:04.381
But with American defense,
the decay is stopped before it starts.

36:04.422 --> 36:09.102
That's why nine out of ten
small countries choose American defense.

36:09.182 --> 36:13.341
Or Crelm toothpaste
with the miracle ingredient Frauduline.

36:13.382 --> 36:15.902
The white car represents
Crelm toothpaste...

36:15.942 --> 36:17.942
with the miracle ingredient
Frauduline.

36:18.022 --> 36:21.181
The not-white car represents
another toothpaste.

36:23.621 --> 36:26.102
Both cars provide 30% protection.

36:27.902 --> 36:30.662
At 60% protection,
both cars are doing well.

36:32.261 --> 36:34.661
At 90% protection... Wait.

36:34.742 --> 36:36.422
The not-white car is out...

36:36.502 --> 36:40.182
and Crelm toothpaste goes on
to win with 100% protection.

36:40.262 --> 36:42.861
Yes. Do like all smart motorists.

36:42.942 --> 36:44.981
Choose Crelm toothpaste!

36:45.061 --> 36:49.342
Or Shrill petrol,
with the new additive GLC-9424075,...

36:49.422 --> 36:51.742
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047.

36:51.782 --> 36:54.342
Using this white card
to represent engine deposits...

36:54.422 --> 36:59.141
and this black card to represent
Shrill's new additive, GLC-9424075,...

36:59.221 --> 37:01.621
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047...

37:01.702 --> 37:04.822
we can see how the engine deposits
are pushed off the face of the earth...

37:04.902 --> 37:07.062
by the superior forces
available to Sh-

37:12.902 --> 37:14.582
This is the police.

37:14.662 --> 37:17.581
We know you're in there,
so come out with your hands up.

37:17.662 --> 37:19.942
You'll never take me alive
copper!

37:19.982 --> 37:22.422
All right, then. Sergeant!

37:40.422 --> 37:43.702
Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth.

38:29.381 --> 38:33.862
Thank you, thank you,
Conrad Poohs and His Exploding Teeth.

38:33.941 --> 38:37.422
A smile, two fangs
and an "Excuse me".

38:37.502 --> 38:40.062
And next tonight,
gentlemen and ladies...

38:40.102 --> 38:43.382
here at the Peephole Club
for the very first time...

38:43.462 --> 38:45.302
we're very proud to welcome...

38:45.382 --> 38:49.301
Ken Ewing and His Musical Mice.

38:57.061 --> 38:59.021
Thank you, thank you.

38:59.102 --> 39:02.622
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have in this box...

39:02.701 --> 39:05.061
23 white mice...

39:05.142 --> 39:08.423
mice which I have
painstakingly trained...

39:08.502 --> 39:10.342
over the past few years...

39:10.421 --> 39:13.382
to squeak at a selected pitch.

39:14.502 --> 39:16.382
This one is "A"- Sharp...

39:16.421 --> 39:18.941
and this one is "G".

39:19.022 --> 39:22.701
"G", "A"- Sharp.
You get the general idea.

39:22.782 --> 39:26.782
Now, these mice are so arranged
upon this rack...

39:26.822 --> 39:29.942
that when played
in the correct order...

39:30.021 --> 39:31.702
they will squeak...

39:31.781 --> 39:34.622
"Three Blinded White Mice. "

39:34.702 --> 39:37.942
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, on the mouse organ...

39:38.022 --> 39:40.462
"Three Blinded White Mice. "

39:40.542 --> 39:42.181
Thank you.

39:45.102 --> 39:47.702
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody stop him.

40:10.222 --> 40:12.102
Ten seconds, studio.

40:14.062 --> 40:16.502
Stop him!
Stop that bastard!

40:19.982 --> 40:23.902
Hello, and welcome to another
edition of It's the Arts.

40:23.981 --> 40:28.102
And we kick off this evening
with a look at the cinema.

40:28.142 --> 40:32.342
One of the most prolific film directors
of this age, or indeed, of any age...

40:32.422 --> 40:35.982
is Sir Edward Ross, back in this country
for the first time in five years...

40:36.061 --> 40:39.821
to open a season of his films
at the National Film Theatre.

40:39.902 --> 40:43.422
And we are indeed fortunate to have him
with us in the studio this evening.

40:43.502 --> 40:45.502
- Good evening.
- Edward...

40:45.581 --> 40:47.942
- You don't mind if I call you Edward?
- Not at all.

40:47.981 --> 40:50.262
It does seem to worry some people.
I'm not sure why.

40:50.342 --> 40:53.782
Some are sensitive, so I do take the
precaution of asking on these occasions.

40:53.861 --> 40:57.262
- No, that's fine.
- So Edward it is. Splendid.

40:57.342 --> 41:00.342
- I'm sorry to have brought it up.
- No. Edward it is.

41:00.422 --> 41:03.022
Thank you very much
for being so helpful.

41:03.102 --> 41:06.862
- At times it's more than my job's worth.
- Quite.

41:06.942 --> 41:10.661
Makes it hard to establish a rapport,
to put the other person at his ease.

41:10.741 --> 41:12.582
- Quite.
- Quite.

41:12.661 --> 41:15.262
Silly little point,
but it does seem to matter.

41:15.302 --> 41:19.621
Still less said the better.
Ted, when you first went in the film...

41:19.702 --> 41:22.301
You don't mind if I call you Ted,
as opposed to Edward?

41:22.342 --> 41:24.381
- No. Everyone calls me Ted.
- Splendid.

41:24.422 --> 41:27.141
- Because it's much shorter, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

41:27.222 --> 41:30.461
- Much less formal.
- Ted, Edward, anything.

41:30.502 --> 41:32.901
Splendid.
Incidentally, do call me Tom.

41:32.942 --> 41:35.781
I don't want you bothering with
any of this "Thomas" nonsense.

41:38.622 --> 41:41.182
Fine. Where were we?
Eddie baby, when you first...

41:41.221 --> 41:45.022
I'm sorry. I don't like
being called Eddie baby.

41:45.061 --> 41:48.342
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't like being called Eddie baby.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.381
Now get on with your interview.

41:51.501 --> 41:54.821
- Did I call you Eddie baby?
- Yes, you did.

41:54.862 --> 41:57.822
I don't think I did.
Did I call him Eddie baby?

41:57.901 --> 42:00.461
Yes, you did!

42:00.542 --> 42:02.822
I didn't call you Eddie baby,
did I, sweetie?

42:02.862 --> 42:05.221
- Don't call me sweetie.
- Can I call you sugar plum?

42:05.302 --> 42:06.782
- No!
- Pussycat?

42:06.822 --> 42:09.062
- No!
- Angel drawers?

42:09.102 --> 42:11.301
No, you may not.

42:11.382 --> 42:13.501
- Now get on with it.
- Can I call you Frank?

42:15.381 --> 42:18.182
- Why Frank?
- Frank's a nice name.

42:18.261 --> 42:21.021
President Nixon's got
a hedgehog called Frank.

42:21.062 --> 42:24.502
- What is going on?
- Frank. Frankie. Fran. Frannie.

42:24.581 --> 42:27.822
- Little Frannie Boo.
- That's it. I'm leaving.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.462
Had enough of this.
I've never been so insulted.

42:30.541 --> 42:33.541
- Tell us about your film, Sir Edward.
- What?

42:33.621 --> 42:37.542
Tell us about your latest film,
Sir Edward, if you'd be so kind.

42:37.621 --> 42:41.182
- None of this pussycat nonsense?
- Promise.

42:41.261 --> 42:43.141
Please. Sir Edward.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.341
- My latest film?
- Yes, Sir Edward.

42:47.942 --> 42:52.862
I first had the idea, funnily enough,
when I joined the industry in 1919.

42:52.901 --> 42:55.421
Of course, in those days
I was only a tea boy...

42:55.462 --> 42:57.222
Oh, shut up.

42:57.301 --> 42:59.421
- There he is!
- Get him.

43:09.902 --> 43:12.622
Stop him!

43:12.701 --> 43:14.702
He's a murderer!

43:14.781 --> 43:17.502
Come back, you fiend! Fiend!

43:17.542 --> 43:19.421
He's a murderer!

44:38.981 --> 44:41.462
"The room is full of milkmen...

44:42.501 --> 44:45.501
some of whom are...

44:46.381 --> 44:50.021
are very old. "

44:54.982 --> 44:57.382
This man is Ernest Scribbler...

44:57.461 --> 44:59.742
manufacturer of jokes.

44:59.781 --> 45:03.582
In a few moments he will think
of the funniest joke in the world...

45:03.662 --> 45:07.422
and as a result
he will die laughing.

45:48.302 --> 45:51.182
It was obvious
the joke was lethal.

45:51.262 --> 45:53.662
No one could read it and live.

45:53.741 --> 45:56.941
Scribbler's mother, alarmed by
the unusual sounds of merriment...

45:57.022 --> 46:01.022
entered the room and found
what was, apparently...

46:01.101 --> 46:02.982
a suicide note.

46:30.901 --> 46:32.781
The war against the Hun
continues...

46:32.862 --> 46:35.221
and as Britain's brave boys
battle against the Bosch...

46:35.302 --> 46:38.382
their leaders are on the lookout for
new breakthroughs that could provide...

46:38.462 --> 46:41.262
the ultimate weapon
in the war against the Hun.

46:43.142 --> 46:47.022
Here, in this little house in Pinchley,
they think maybe they've found it.

46:47.101 --> 46:51.142
It's a joke so deadly, it could have
Fritz's forces falling about.

47:04.582 --> 47:06.622
Tests on Salisbury Plain confirm...

47:06.661 --> 47:10.421
the joke's devastating effectiveness
at a range of up to 50 yards.

47:38.982 --> 47:41.821
Fantastic!

47:42.782 --> 47:45.381
All through the winter of '43...

47:45.461 --> 47:48.862
we had translators working
in joke-proof conditions...

47:48.942 --> 47:52.901
to try and manufacture
a German version of the joke.

47:52.981 --> 47:56.262
They worked on one word each
for greater safety.

47:56.342 --> 48:00.702
One of them saw two words by mistake and
had to spend several weeks in hospital.

48:00.741 --> 48:03.462
But apart from that,
things went ahead pretty fast.

48:03.501 --> 48:05.942
And by January
we had the joke in a form...

48:06.022 --> 48:09.821
which our troops couldn't understand,
but which the Germans could.

48:09.863 --> 48:12.662
So on July the 8th, 1944...

48:12.742 --> 48:14.942
the joke was first told
to the enemy...

48:14.982 --> 48:16.862
in the Ardennes.

48:18.221 --> 48:21.142
Squad, tell the joke!

48:46.621 --> 48:48.862
In action, it was deadly.

49:24.141 --> 49:26.141
The German casualties
were appalling.

49:35.782 --> 49:38.822
It was a fantastic success
over 80,000 times as powerful...

49:38.902 --> 49:41.662
as Britain's great prewar joke,
which was used at Munich...

49:41.702 --> 49:43.582
and one which Hitler
couldn't match.

49:52.581 --> 49:55.862
I would like to apologize
for the rather poor taste...

49:55.942 --> 49:57.781
of the previous item.

49:59.142 --> 50:01.182
And excuse me, please.

50:35.261 --> 50:37.102
Fleet Street, please.

50:38.141 --> 50:39.982
All right, everybody,
stay close.

50:40.062 --> 50:42.062
Don't lag behind.
Keep together, everybody.

50:42.141 --> 50:44.702
Remember. Watch out
for the killer cars.

50:48.981 --> 50:50.782
Yes, the killer cars.

50:50.822 --> 50:55.621
For years the city had been plagued by
ever-increasing pedestrian congestion.

50:55.702 --> 50:57.822
In an attempt to eliminate
this problem...

50:57.862 --> 51:00.061
certain fanatical cars,..

51:00.102 --> 51:02.941
had taken the law
into their own hands.

51:06.222 --> 51:08.581
But the days of the killer cars
were numbered...

51:08.622 --> 51:11.901
thanks to the miracle
of atomic mutation.

51:27.342 --> 51:30.102
Thank you!
You've saved our city!

51:30.182 --> 51:32.021
But at what cost?

51:37.302 --> 51:40.702
Just then as it looked for certain,
that the city was about to be eaten...

51:40.742 --> 51:44.062
the earth trembled and the sun
was blotted out from the sky.

51:45.421 --> 51:47.982
Suddenly, swarms of giant
bees filled the air...

51:48.061 --> 51:52.061
and 300 million armored horsemen covered
with coats of 1,000 different colors...

51:52.141 --> 51:54.982
appeared at every street corner
attacking the monster cat...

51:55.021 --> 51:57.222
in a scene of such
spectacular proportions...

51:57.302 --> 52:00.862
that it could never in your life be seen
in a low-budget film like this.

52:00.942 --> 52:03.101
If you'd notice,
my mouth isn't moving either.

52:03.182 --> 52:06.462
But just as the monster cat
was starting to weaken...

52:06.502 --> 52:09.022
the earth split apart
with a deafening roar and...

52:55.062 --> 52:57.541
Hello. I wish
to register a complaint.

52:58.902 --> 53:01.822
- Hello. Miss?
- What do you mean, "miss"?

53:03.142 --> 53:06.501
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a cold.
I wish to make a complaint.

53:08.063 --> 53:10.141
Sorry.
We're closing for lunch.

53:10.182 --> 53:13.302
Nevermind that, my lad.
I wish to complain about this parrot...

53:13.382 --> 53:16.541
what I purchased not half an hour ago
from this very boutique.

53:16.582 --> 53:19.622
Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue.
What's wrong with it?

53:19.702 --> 53:21.782
I'll tell you what's
wrong with it, my lad.

53:21.861 --> 53:24.541
It's dead.
That's what's wrong with it.

53:24.582 --> 53:27.262
No, it's resting. Look.

53:27.342 --> 53:31.742
Look, my lad, I know a dead parrot when
I see one and I'm looking at one now.

53:31.782 --> 53:34.021
No, that's not dead,
it's resting.

53:34.102 --> 53:36.302
- Resting?
- Yeah, resting.

53:36.382 --> 53:39.223
Remarkable bird, the Norwegian blue,
isn't it? Beautiful plumage.

53:39.302 --> 53:43.221
The plumage don't enter into it.
It's still dead.

53:43.302 --> 53:45.221
No, it's resting.

53:46.502 --> 53:50.061
All right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.

53:50.142 --> 53:51.662
Hello, Polly!

53:53.222 --> 53:57.782
I've got a nice, fresh cuttlefish for
you if you wake up, Mr. Polly Parrot!

53:57.862 --> 54:00.662
- There, he moved.
- No, that was you pushing the cage.

54:00.742 --> 54:02.901
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did

54:02.982 --> 54:04.901
Hello, Polly!

54:07.182 --> 54:09.062
Wakey, wakey!

54:10.702 --> 54:13.180
Rise and shine.

54:13.222 --> 54:15.902
This is your 9:00 alarm call.

54:20.701 --> 54:22.542
That's what I call
a dead parrot.

54:23.543 --> 54:25.942
- No, he's stunned.
- Stunned?

54:26.021 --> 54:28.382
Yeah, you stunned him
just as he was wakin' up.

54:28.422 --> 54:31.622
- Norwegian blues stun easily.
- I've had enough of this.

54:31.661 --> 54:35.582
That parrot is definitely deceased,
and when I bought it a half hour ago...

54:35.661 --> 54:38.222
you assured me that
its total lack of movement...

54:38.301 --> 54:42.702
was due to it being tired
and shagged out after a long squall.

54:42.782 --> 54:45.501
Well, he's pining
for the fjords.

54:48.902 --> 54:53.141
Pinin' for the fjords?
What kind of talk is that?

54:53.222 --> 54:56.541
Look, why did it fall flat on its back
the minute I got it home?

54:56.622 --> 55:00.421
Well, the Norwegian blue prefers
keeping on its back. Beautiful plumage.

55:00.462 --> 55:04.462
Look, I took the liberty of examining
that parrot and I discovered...

55:04.541 --> 55:08.102
the only reason it had been sitting
on its perch in the first place...

55:08.181 --> 55:11.182
was that it had been
nailed there.

55:11.261 --> 55:13.102
Oh, well, of course
it was nailed there.

55:13.183 --> 55:17.461
If I hadn't nailed it there, it would
have muscled up to those bars and boom.

55:17.542 --> 55:19.062
Look here mate.

55:20.142 --> 55:24.421
This parrot wouldn't boom
if you put 4,000 volts through it.

55:24.462 --> 55:26.622
It's bleedin' demised.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.662
No, it's pining.

55:29.702 --> 55:33.501
It's not pining,
it's passed on.

55:34.501 --> 55:36.782
This parrot is no more.

55:36.862 --> 55:39.141
It has ceased to be.

55:39.182 --> 55:42.502
It's expired and
gone to see its maker.

55:42.581 --> 55:45.461
This is a late parrot!

55:46.422 --> 55:48.022
It's a stiff.

55:48.101 --> 55:50.981
Bereft of life.
It rests in peace.

55:51.062 --> 55:54.942
If you hadn't nailed it to the perch,
it would be pushing up the daisies.

55:54.981 --> 55:58.501
It's run down the curtain
and joined the choir invisible.

55:58.582 --> 56:03.222
This is an ex-parrot.

56:06.021 --> 56:08.182
Well. I'd better
replace it then.

56:08.262 --> 56:10.942
If you want to get anything done in
this country you've got to complain...

56:10.982 --> 56:13.142
till you're blue in the mouth.

56:13.221 --> 56:15.302
Sorry, squire.
We're right out of parrots.

56:15.382 --> 56:17.342
I see.
I get the picture.

56:19.022 --> 56:22.621
- I've got a slug.
- Does it talk?

56:24.102 --> 56:25.941
Not really.

56:26.022 --> 56:28.982
Well, it's scarcely
a replacement then, is it?

56:31.622 --> 56:35.341
Listen. I didn't want
to work in a pet shop.

56:35.422 --> 56:37.661
I wanted to be a lumberjack.

56:40.262 --> 56:42.101
Sorry. This is irrelevant.

56:42.182 --> 56:43.401
Yes, a lumberjack!

56:43.436 --> 56:44.621
Yes, a lumberjack!

56:44.702 --> 56:49.181
Leaping from trees as they float down
the mighty rivers of British Columbia.

56:49.222 --> 56:51.582
The giant redwood!

56:51.621 --> 56:53.622
The larch!

56:53.701 --> 56:57.102
The fir!
The mighty Scotch pine!

56:57.182 --> 56:59.021
What about my bloody parrot?

56:59.102 --> 57:01.942
The smell of fresh-cut timber!

57:02.022 --> 57:04.742
The crash of mighty trees.

57:04.822 --> 57:09.462
With my best girl
by my side, we'd sing!

57:13.462 --> 57:15.902
I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay

57:15.982 --> 57:18.542
I sleep all night
and I work all day

57:18.622 --> 57:20.901
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

57:20.942 --> 57:23.341
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

57:23.422 --> 57:25.822
I cut down trees
I eat my lunch

57:25.901 --> 57:28.262
I go to the lavatory

57:28.302 --> 57:30.582
On Wednesday
I go shopping

57:30.661 --> 57:33.022
And have buttered scones for tea

57:33.062 --> 57:35.942
He cuts down trees
He eats his lunch

57:35.982 --> 57:38.222
He goes to the lavatory

57:38.301 --> 57:40.582
On Wednesday
he goes shopping

57:40.662 --> 57:43.462
And has buttered scones for tea

57:43.501 --> 57:45.862
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

57:45.942 --> 57:48.382
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

57:48.422 --> 57:51.021
I cut down trees
I skip and jump

57:51.101 --> 57:53.502
I like to press wild flowers

57:53.582 --> 57:56.062
I put on women's clothing

57:56.101 --> 57:58.662
And hang around in bars

57:58.741 --> 58:01.301
He cuts down trees
He skips and jumps

58:01.382 --> 58:03.621
He likes to press wild flowers

58:03.662 --> 58:06.061
He puts on women's clothing

58:06.142 --> 58:08.902
And hangs around in bars

58:08.941 --> 58:11.302
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

58:11.382 --> 58:13.822
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

58:13.901 --> 58:16.541
I cut down trees
I wear high heels

58:16.622 --> 58:18.902
Suspenders and a bra

58:18.981 --> 58:21.502
I wish I'd been a girlie

58:21.541 --> 58:24.181
Just like my dear papa

58:24.262 --> 58:26.982
- I cut down trees, I wear high heels
- He cuts down trees

58:27.060 --> 58:29.662
Suspenders and a bra

58:29.702 --> 58:31.862
I wish I'd been a girlie

58:31.941 --> 58:35.021
Just like my dear papa

58:35.102 --> 58:36.901
Oh, Brevers!

58:36.942 --> 58:39.901
And I thought
you were so butch

58:41.422 --> 58:43.101
Oh, you pansy!

58:52.862 --> 58:55.022
And now for something
completely different.

59:02.822 --> 59:04.822
Hello, darling.
Sorry I'm so late.

59:04.901 --> 59:07.062
That's all right, darling.
I'm 20 minutes late myself.

59:07.142 --> 59:10.261
- Let's not start worrying about that.
- It's nice here, isn't it?

59:10.342 --> 59:12.822
Yes. A very good restaurant.
Five stars, you know?

59:12.902 --> 59:14.822
- Really?
- Oh, yes. Terrific reputation.

59:14.902 --> 59:17.702
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.

59:17.782 --> 59:20.582
May I say what a pleasure it is
to see you here again, sir?

59:20.662 --> 59:24.701
Thank you. Apparently,
the boeuf en croute is fantastic.

59:24.742 --> 59:27.261
If I may recommend, sir,
the faisan a la reine.

59:27.341 --> 59:30.221
The sauce is one of the chef's
most famous creations.

59:30.302 --> 59:32.541
- Mmm, that sounds very good.
- Sounds lovely.

59:32.582 --> 59:35.062
Anyway, darling,
have a look at the menu.

59:35.142 --> 59:37.301
See what you want.
Take your time.

59:37.382 --> 59:40.982
By the way, I've got a bit of a dirty
fork. Could you get me another one?

59:41.061 --> 59:44.902
- I beg your pardon?
- It's dirty. Could I get another fork?

59:44.982 --> 59:48.542
- Sir, I do apologize.
- No need to apologize. Doesn't worry me.

59:48.581 --> 59:50.942
No. I do apologize, sir.

59:50.982 --> 59:53.542
I will fetch the headwaiter
immediatement.

59:53.622 --> 59:55.942
No, please.
No need to do that.

59:55.983 --> 59:58.382
Oh no.
I feel sure the headwaiter...

59:58.462 --> 01:00:01.622
he will want to apologize
to you himself, personally.

01:00:01.702 --> 01:00:06.301
I cannot think how this has happened.
I will fetch him at once.

01:00:06.342 --> 01:00:09.181
Well, you certainly
get good service here, don't you?

01:00:09.222 --> 01:00:11.381
Yes, they really
look after you here.

01:00:11.462 --> 01:00:14.102
This all looks delicious.

01:00:15.381 --> 01:00:19.141
Excuse me, sir, madame.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:21.461
This is filthy.
Who the hell washes up?

01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:24.340
Find out who washes up and give
them their cards immediately.

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:27.022
No! On second thought,
we can't take any chances.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:30.822
- Sack the entire washing-up staff
- I don't want to cause any trouble.

01:00:30.902 --> 01:00:34.862
It's quite right that you bring
this sort of thing to our attention.

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:38.422
Find the manager and tell him
what has happened immediately!

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.461
- Please, I don't want to make any fuss.
- Oh, no, there's no fuss.

01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:43.901
We simply wish to ensure
that nothing interferes...

01:00:43.943 --> 01:00:46.021
with your complete
enjoyment of the meal.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.382
I'm sure it won't.
It was only a dirty fork.

01:00:49.462 --> 01:00:53.942
I know, and I'm sorry.
Bitterly sorry.

01:00:54.022 --> 01:00:58.342
But I know nothing I can say can alter
the fact that in this restaurant...

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:02.941
you have been given a dirty,
filthy, smelly piece of cutlery.

01:01:02.982 --> 01:01:05.342
- It wasn't smelly.
- It is smelly.

01:01:05.381 --> 01:01:07.742
And obscene and disgusting.
I hate it.

01:01:07.781 --> 01:01:11.101
- That's enough, Gilberto.
- Dirty, nasty, smutty!

01:01:12.781 --> 01:01:15.102
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, madame.

01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:18.782
I'm the manager.
I've only just heard what's happened.

01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:21.421
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:28.261
I want to apologize
humbly, deeply and sincerely...

01:01:28.342 --> 01:01:30.182
about the fork.

01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:33.822
No. Really, it was only a tiny piece
of dirt. You can hardly see it.

01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:38.702
Oh, you're good, kind,
fine people for saying that.

01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:42.662
But I can see it.
To me it's like a boulder...

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.861
a vast bowl of pus.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.501
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- No, it gets me here.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:53.462
I can't give you any excuses.
There are no excuses.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:56.261
I've been meaning to spend
more time in the restaurant...

01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:01.182
but I haven't been well recently and
things have been going badly back there.

01:02:01.262 --> 01:02:03.702
Poor old Mrs. Dalrymple
who prepares the salad...

01:02:03.781 --> 01:02:06.462
can hardly move
her poor, swollen fingers.

01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:09.822
And then, of course,
there's Gilberto's war wound.

01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:12.741
But they're good people,
and they're fine people...

01:02:12.822 --> 01:02:16.222
and together we were beginning
to get over this bad patch.

01:02:16.261 --> 01:02:18.902
There was light
at the end of the tunnel...

01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:21.542
when this...

01:02:21.622 --> 01:02:24.901
when this happened!

01:02:24.982 --> 01:02:28.822
- Can I get you some water?
- It's the end of the road!

01:02:31.221 --> 01:02:33.782
You bastards!

01:02:33.861 --> 01:02:35.342
You mean us?

01:02:35.421 --> 01:02:38.782
You vicious,
heartless bastards!

01:02:40.422 --> 01:02:42.462
Look what you've done to him.

01:02:42.501 --> 01:02:46.542
He's worked his fingers to the bone
to make this place what it is!

01:02:46.622 --> 01:02:49.862
And you come in here
with your petty...

01:02:49.942 --> 01:02:53.022
vicious, heartless quibbling...

01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:56.502
and you grind him
into the dirt.

01:02:58.902 --> 01:03:01.982
This fine, honorable man...

01:03:02.061 --> 01:03:05.862
whose boots you
are not worthy to kiss!

01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:11.742
Oh, it makes me mad.

01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:22.301
Easy, Mongo! Easy.

01:03:22.342 --> 01:03:25.501
Stark, stirring mad.

01:03:25.582 --> 01:03:28.222
No, Mongo! Oh!
Oh, the wound!

01:03:28.301 --> 01:03:30.742
They destroyed him!

01:03:30.821 --> 01:03:34.141
It's the end! The end.

01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:38.021
He's dead.

01:03:38.102 --> 01:03:39.942
They killed him!

01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:41.901
Revenge.

01:03:43.942 --> 01:03:46.942
No, Mongo!
Never kill a customer.

01:03:46.981 --> 01:03:49.502
Oh, the wound again.

01:03:49.582 --> 01:03:51.941
They ruined him!

01:03:57.542 --> 01:04:00.340
Lucky I didn't tell'em
about the dirty knife.

01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:41.302
Good morning.
I'm a bank robber.

01:04:41.382 --> 01:04:44.181
Please don't panic.
Just hand over all the money.

01:04:44.262 --> 01:04:46.862
This is a lingerie shop, sir.

01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:52.982
Fine, fine.

01:04:56.742 --> 01:04:58.902
Adopt, adapt and improve.

01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:03.382
- Well, what have you got?
- We've got corsets, stockings...

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:06.382
suspender belts, tights, bras,
slips, petticoats, knickers...

01:05:06.462 --> 01:05:08.501
socks and garters, sir.

01:05:08.582 --> 01:05:10.102
Fine.

01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:15.342
No large quantities
of money in safes?

01:05:15.422 --> 01:05:17.781
No, sir.

01:05:17.862 --> 01:05:21.142
No piles of cash
in easy-to-carry bags?

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:23.421
No, sir.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:25.022
Fine.

01:05:34.982 --> 01:05:36.821
Just a pair of panties then,
please.

01:05:46.341 --> 01:05:48.382
And now for something
completely different.

01:05:53.342 --> 01:05:55.621
Hey, did you see that?

01:05:57.822 --> 01:06:01.061
Did you see something
go past the window?

01:06:01.142 --> 01:06:02.022
What?

01:06:02.102 --> 01:06:05.222
Somebody went past
that window, downwards.

01:06:10.021 --> 01:06:11.742
Another one.

01:06:13.822 --> 01:06:16.062
Another one just went past,
downwards.

01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:18.382
What?

01:06:18.462 --> 01:06:20.822
Two people have just fallen
past that window!

01:06:21.982 --> 01:06:23.821
Fine.

01:06:23.902 --> 01:06:28.342
Look, two people... three people
have just fallen past that window.

01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:33.222
Must be a board meeting.

01:06:33.302 --> 01:06:35.622
Oh, yeah.

01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:39.582
- That was Wilkins of finance.
- No, that was Robertson.

01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:42.342
- Wilkins.
- It was Robertson.

01:06:45.061 --> 01:06:47.862
- That was Wilkins.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:47.941 --> 01:06:49.941
Bet Parkinson next.

01:06:50.022 --> 01:06:52.742
- Bet you it won't.
- How much?

01:06:53.902 --> 01:06:57.781
- What?
- How much do you bet it won't? Fiver?

01:06:57.862 --> 01:07:00.862
- Yeah, all right.
- Right. Done. You're on.

01:07:00.942 --> 01:07:02.901
Parkinson next.

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:08.142
- Come on, Parky!
- Don't be silly, Parky!

01:07:08.222 --> 01:07:10.782
- Come on, Parky! Jump!
- Don't be stupid, man!

01:07:10.822 --> 01:07:14.222
Dear Sir, I would like to complain
about that last scene...

01:07:14.302 --> 01:07:16.582
about people falling
out of high buildings.

01:07:16.621 --> 01:07:19.782
I myself have worked all
my life in such a building...

01:07:19.862 --> 01:07:22.900
and have never once...

01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:31.621
Psst. All clear.

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:43.981
Vocational guidance counselor.

01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:58.301
Ah, Mr. Anchovy.
Do sit down.

01:08:58.381 --> 01:09:01.261
Oh, thank you. Take the weight
off the feet, eh?

01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:03.261
Yes.

01:09:03.341 --> 01:09:05.622
Lovely weather
for the time of year, I must say.

01:09:05.702 --> 01:09:08.981
Enough of this gay banter. Mr. Anchovy,
you asked us to advise you...

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.622
which job in life
you were best suited for.

01:09:11.702 --> 01:09:13.942
- That is correct.
- Well. I have the results here...

01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:16.782
of all the interviews and the aptitude
tests that you took last week...

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:21.060
and from them we've built up clear
impression of the person you are...

01:09:21.142 --> 01:09:24.020
and I think I can say
without fear of contradiction...

01:09:24.102 --> 01:09:26.461
that the ideal job for you
is accountancy.

01:09:27.502 --> 01:09:28.942
But I am an accountant.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.982
Jolly good. Well, back
to the office with you then.

01:09:32.062 --> 01:09:33.902
No, no,
you don't understand.

01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:36.301
I've been an accountant
for the last 20 years.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:39.301
But I want a new job, something
exciting that will let me live.

01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:41.621
But accountancy
is quite exciting.

01:09:41.702 --> 01:09:44.662
Exciting? No, it's not.

01:09:44.742 --> 01:09:47.261
It's dull, dull, dull!

01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:49.662
My God, it's dull.

01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:52.581
It's so deadly dull
and tedious...

01:09:52.662 --> 01:09:56.461
and stuffy and boring
and desperately dull!

01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.302
I can't stand it any longer.
I want to live.

01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:02.662
Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but,
you see, in your report here...

01:10:02.702 --> 01:10:06.022
it says that you are
an extremely dull person.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.501
Our experts describe you as...

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:12.341
"an appallingly dull fellow",
"unimaginative",...

01:10:12.422 --> 01:10:15.821
"timid, spineless, "
"easily dominated",...

01:10:15.901 --> 01:10:18.581
"no sense of humor",
"tedious company"...

01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:20.862
and "irrepressibly
drab and awful".

01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:23.902
And where as in most professions
these would be considerable drawbacks...

01:10:23.981 --> 01:10:26.142
in accountancy
they are a positive boon.

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:29.782
I'm only as awful as this
because accountancy does this to people.

01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:32.381
Can't you help me?

01:10:32.422 --> 01:10:34.422
Any idea of what you want to be?

01:10:34.501 --> 01:10:37.141
- Yes. Yes, I have.
- What is it?

01:10:37.222 --> 01:10:39.581
A lion tamer.

01:10:41.701 --> 01:10:44.622
Yes. Of course,
it's a bit of a jump, isn't it...

01:10:44.702 --> 01:10:47.101
accountancy to lion taming
in one go?

01:10:47.182 --> 01:10:51.142
Don't think it'd be better to work your
way towards lion taming via banking?

01:10:51.221 --> 01:10:53.421
- Or insurance?
- No! I don't want to wait.

01:10:53.502 --> 01:10:55.782
I want to start immediately.
Tomorrow morning at 9:00...

01:10:55.821 --> 01:10:57.941
I want to be in there, taming.

01:10:58.022 --> 01:11:01.222
Yes, but what qualifications
do you have?

01:11:01.302 --> 01:11:03.862
- I've got a hat.
- A hat?

01:11:03.941 --> 01:11:06.743
Yes, a lion taming hat, a hat
with "Lion Tamer" written on it...

01:11:06.822 --> 01:11:09.982
and it lights up, saying "Lion Tamer"
in big red neon letters...

01:11:10.021 --> 01:11:11.942
so you can tame them
after dark.

01:11:12.022 --> 01:11:14.462
- I see.
- During the day, you switch it off...

01:11:14.502 --> 01:11:17.782
and you can claim it as reasonable wear
and tear under "allowable expenses"...

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:19.741
under paragraph 335...

01:11:19.782 --> 01:11:22.741
Yes. I follow.
But, you see, the snag is...

01:11:22.822 --> 01:11:25.142
if I now call the service
and say to them...

01:11:25.222 --> 01:11:29.342
"I've got a 45-year-old accountant
who wants to become a lion tamer"...

01:11:29.422 --> 01:11:33.302
their first question is not going to be
"Does he have his own hat?"

01:11:33.382 --> 01:11:37.342
They're more likely to ask
what experience you've had with lions.

01:11:37.382 --> 01:11:40.902
- I've seen'em at the zoo.
- Good.

01:11:40.982 --> 01:11:44.861
Little brown, furry creatures with
short, stumpy legs and great long noses.

01:11:44.903 --> 01:11:47.501
I could tame one of those.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

01:11:47.582 --> 01:11:49.662
Look pretty tame
to start with.

01:11:49.742 --> 01:11:52.302
And these lions,
how high are they?

01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:56.182
Oh, about so high.
They don't frighten me at all.

01:11:56.261 --> 01:11:58.382
And do these lions eat ants?

01:11:58.461 --> 01:12:00.302
Yes, that's right.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:06.622
Well, I'm afraid what you've got hold of
there, Mr. Anchovy, is an anteater.

01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:09.782
- A what?
- An anteater, not a lion.

01:12:09.861 --> 01:12:12.142
You see a lion,
is a huge savage beast...

01:12:12.222 --> 01:12:14.302
about ten-foot long,
five-foot high...

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.742
with masses of sharp,
pointy teeth...

01:12:16.782 --> 01:12:18.902
and nasty, long,
razor-sharp claws.

01:12:18.982 --> 01:12:20.942
It looks like this.

01:12:22.982 --> 01:12:26.461
- Now. shall I call the circus?
- No!

01:12:26.502 --> 01:12:29.382
I like your idea
of making the move...

01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:31.382
to lion taming
by easy stages...

01:12:31.463 --> 01:12:34.262
say by insurance
or banking.

01:12:34.342 --> 01:12:36.662
- Banking?
- Yes, banking. I see it now.

01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:38.782
It's a man's life, isn't it?
Travel. excitement...

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.821
decisions affecting people's lives,
romance, thrills.

01:12:42.902 --> 01:12:44.982
I'll put you in touch
with the bank.

01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:49.102
Probably.

01:12:49.182 --> 01:12:52.541
I'd like a couple of days to think
about it, 'cause it is a big decision.

01:12:52.622 --> 01:12:54.780
Or maybe, maybe a week,
at most, you know?

01:12:54.861 --> 01:12:58.902
But I do want to make this decision.
I'd like to do banking...

01:12:58.982 --> 01:13:00.542
It's sad, isn't it...

01:13:00.582 --> 01:13:03.542
that this is what
accountancy does to people?

01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:07.342
The only way that we can fight this
terrible, debilitating social disease...

01:13:07.422 --> 01:13:10.581
I only want to be famous.
I only want to see my name in lights.

01:13:10.662 --> 01:13:12.542
And so you shall.

01:13:20.782 --> 01:13:22.301
Cue!

01:13:28.222 --> 01:13:30.582
Hello, good evening,
and welcome to "Blackmail. "

01:13:30.662 --> 01:13:34.102
To start tonight's program,
we go north to Preston in Lancashire...

01:13:34.182 --> 01:13:36.020
and Mrs. Betty Teal.

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:42.101
Hello Mrs. Teal.
Now, Mrs. Teal, this is for $15...

01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:45.942
and is to stop us revealing
the name of your lover in Bolton.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:49.022
So, Mrs. Teal, send us $15
by return of post, please...

01:13:49.102 --> 01:13:52.862
and your husband Trevor and your lovely
children Diane, Janice and Juliet...

01:13:52.902 --> 01:13:57.061
need never know the name
of your lover in Bolton.

01:14:02.382 --> 01:14:05.422
Now, a letter, a series
of photographs...

01:14:05.502 --> 01:14:08.742
and a hotel registration book
which could add up to divorce...

01:14:08.781 --> 01:14:11.582
premature retirement and
possible criminal proceedings...

01:14:11.622 --> 01:14:14.022
for a company director
in Bromsgrove.

01:14:14.062 --> 01:14:16.142
He's a Freemason
and a conservative M.P.

01:14:16.222 --> 01:14:19.742
So, Mr. S. of Bromsgrove,
that's $3,000, please...

01:14:19.821 --> 01:14:24.141
to stop us revealing your name, the name
of the three other people involved...

01:14:24.222 --> 01:14:26.302
the youth organization
to which they belong...

01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:28.581
and the shop where
you bought the equipment.

01:14:35.902 --> 01:14:39.062
Well, we'll be showing you more of that
photograph later in the program...

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:42.822
unless we hear
from Charles or Michael.

01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:45.302
Now it's time for
our "Stop The Film" spot.

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:47.222
The rules are very simple.

01:14:47.302 --> 01:14:49.662
We have taken a film which
contains compromising scenes...

01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:53.662
and unpleasant details
which could wreck a man's career.

01:14:53.742 --> 01:14:56.862
But the victim may phone me
at any time and stop the film.

01:14:56.942 --> 01:14:59.981
But don't forget, the money increases
as the film goes on...

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:02.902
so the longer you leave it,
the more you have to pay.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.702
So, with the clock at $300 this week's
"Stop the Film" visited Temstead.

01:15:57.941 --> 01:16:00.181
He's a very brave man.

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:09.102
No, sir. No.

01:16:09.182 --> 01:16:11.661
I'm sure you didn't, sir.
No, that's all right.

01:16:11.742 --> 01:16:14.462
We don't morally censure.
We just want the money.

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.541
And here's the address
to send it to:

01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:23.142
Thank you, sir.

01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:28.062
Ah. There you are.

01:16:28.102 --> 01:16:30.461
Well, that's quite
enough of that.

01:16:30.502 --> 01:16:32.382
And now...

01:16:35.261 --> 01:16:39.981
a local civic group reenacts
a famous scene from history.

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:44.181
This week, the Townswomen Guild
of Sheffield in Yorkshire.

01:16:44.262 --> 01:16:45.741
Miss Rita Fairbanks...

01:16:45.822 --> 01:16:48.621
you organized this representation
of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.

01:16:48.702 --> 01:16:50.142
Why?

01:16:50.222 --> 01:16:53.222
Weve always been extremely
interested in modern works.

01:16:53.302 --> 01:16:57.781
We were the first townswomen's guild
to perform "Camp on Blood Island"...

01:16:57.862 --> 01:16:59.422
and, of course, last year...

01:16:59.502 --> 01:17:03.541
we did our extremely popular
reenactment of Nazi war atrocities...

01:17:03.622 --> 01:17:06.582
so this year we thought we'd do
something in a much lighter vein.

01:17:06.661 --> 01:17:09.782
I can see that you're all ready to go,
so I'Il just wish you good luck...

01:17:09.861 --> 01:17:12.342
in your latest venture,
"The Battle of Pearl Harbor. "

01:17:12.422 --> 01:17:15.742
Thank you very much
indeed, young man.

01:17:41.902 --> 01:17:43.501
Oh, Brian.

01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:45.422
Oh, Elsbeth.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:58.142
Be gentle with me.

01:18:29.702 --> 01:18:34.141
Oh, Brian, are you gonna do anything
or just show me films all evening?

01:18:34.182 --> 01:18:35.782
Just one more, dear.

01:18:46.502 --> 01:18:49.181
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Brantley Park...

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:52.181
just as the competitors are
running out onto the field...

01:18:52.262 --> 01:18:55.022
on this lovely winter afternoon
with the going firm under foot...

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:56.982
and very little sign of rain.

01:18:57.061 --> 01:18:59.422
Looks like we're in for
a splendid afternoon sport...

01:18:59.461 --> 01:19:03.262
on this, the 127th
"Upper Class Twit of the Year" show.

01:19:03.302 --> 01:19:06.781
There's a big crowd here today
to see these prize idiots in action.

01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:08.341
Vivian Smith Smythe Smith.

01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:10.502
He's in the Grenadier Guards,
and can count to four.

01:19:10.582 --> 01:19:12.262
Simon Zinc Trumpet Harris.

01:19:12.342 --> 01:19:15.142
He's an old Italian and married
to an attractive table lamp.

01:19:15.182 --> 01:19:18.022
Nigel Incubator Jones.
His best friend is a tree...

01:19:18.061 --> 01:19:20.181
and in his spare time
he's a stockbroker.

01:19:20.261 --> 01:19:22.821
Javais Brookhamster.
He's in the wine trade...

01:19:22.902 --> 01:19:25.222
and his father uses him
as a wastepaper basket.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.222
And finally, Oliver Singen Mollusk,
another old Italian.

01:19:28.262 --> 01:19:31.221
His father was a cabinet minister
and his mother won the derby.

01:19:31.302 --> 01:19:33.902
He's thought by many to be
this year's outstanding twit.

01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:36.782
And now the twits are moving
up to the starting line...

01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:39.662
and any moment now they'll be
under starter's orders.

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.582
I'm afraid they're facing
the wrong way at the moment...

01:19:41.662 --> 01:19:43.501
the wrong way at the moment,
but the starter will sort this out.

01:19:43.582 --> 01:19:48.501
Any moment now they're going to have the
big off. This is always a tense moment.

01:19:48.581 --> 01:19:50.302
And they're off!

01:19:50.342 --> 01:19:53.942
No, they're not. They didn't realize
that they had to start with the gun.

01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:57.221
I think the starter has explained to
them. Several are beginning to point.

01:19:57.302 --> 01:19:59.622
And ready again,
and off again!

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.541
This time, yes,
a really fast start!

01:20:01.582 --> 01:20:04.981
It's Vivian going for the lead
Oliver's running wide to the right!

01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:07.621
And to the left but,
he'll soon pick up the line...

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:10.342
into the first event which is,
walking along a straight line.

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:13.022
The twits have to walk along these lines
without falling over.

01:20:13.062 --> 01:20:15.542
This is Oliver's worst event.
He's having a little trouble.

01:20:15.622 --> 01:20:18.422
Simon's coming through.
Nigel's coming through.

01:20:18.502 --> 01:20:21.622
Oliver's over at the back. Never mind.
He'll get up. He's a great fighter.

01:20:21.702 --> 01:20:23.622
He's having...
Oh dear, never mind.

01:20:23.702 --> 01:20:26.502
We're coming to the second event,
the matchbox jump.

01:20:26.582 --> 01:20:29.981
Two layers of matchboxes for the twits
to clear. Nigel and Simon are over!

01:20:30.022 --> 01:20:32.060
And Vivian has refused.

01:20:32.142 --> 01:20:34.342
And now,
it's "Kicking the Beggar".

01:20:34.422 --> 01:20:38.342
And Nigel to put the brogue in there!
Oh, beautifully placed!

01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:40.741
The beggar is down,
and the crowd really loved it!

01:20:40.821 --> 01:20:43.461
And here it's Oliver.
He hasn't cleared the jump.

01:20:43.543 --> 01:20:45.781
Oh, if only his father
could understand.

01:20:45.862 --> 01:20:48.341
And now it's
"Running Over the Old Lady".

01:20:48.421 --> 01:20:51.902
Simon in the lead and he's done
it beautifully, right in the midriff.

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:54.822
Back to Oliver.
Oh, he's magnificent, this man.

01:20:54.861 --> 01:20:57.142
He doesn't know when he's beaten. He
doesn't know what he's winning either.

01:20:57.222 --> 01:21:01.182
He has no sort of sensory apparatus
known to man. Bad luck. Oliver.

01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:04.141
And now, it's "Waking the Neighbor".
Simon's there at the front.

01:21:04.222 --> 01:21:08.461
He's slamming that door, and woken
the neighbor Simon's moved into first.

01:21:08.542 --> 01:21:10.382
The crowd is really excited!

01:21:10.461 --> 01:21:12.422
And now it's
"Shooting the Rabbits".

01:21:12.502 --> 01:21:16.182
These rabbits have been staked to the
ground so they can't move too much...

01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:19.541
as this is only
a one-day event.

01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:22.982
There's mist there which I think is
causing the twits a bit of trouble.

01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:25.582
And Javais is using
the butt of his rifle!

01:21:25.662 --> 01:21:28.141
Vivian's going in with a fist,
and Javais is first away!

01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:30.701
And Oliver
has run himself over!

01:21:30.782 --> 01:21:32.622
What a great twit!

01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:36.062
And now, it's "Taking the Bras off
the Debutantes from the Back".

01:21:36.142 --> 01:21:39.142
This is a particularly difficult
event for most of the twits...

01:21:39.221 --> 01:21:42.101
one of the ones that takes the most time
on this exacting course.

01:21:42.182 --> 01:21:46.462
The crowd are getting excited, and I
think the twits are getting excited too.

01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:50.261
And it's Simon into the lead,
closely followed by Nigel!

01:21:50.342 --> 01:21:52.342
And it's the final event now!

01:21:52.422 --> 01:21:55.342
They have to shoot themselves
to become upper class twit of the year.

01:21:55.422 --> 01:21:58.862
Simon can't get the bra off his finger
it's Nigel there!

01:21:58.942 --> 01:22:00.981
Nigel misses!
Simon's missing!

01:22:01.062 --> 01:22:03.862
Nigel misses again!
And Javais has shot himself!

01:22:03.942 --> 01:22:06.902
Javais is
upper class twit of the year!

01:22:06.981 --> 01:22:09.142
Vivian is there!
He's not having any luck!

01:22:09.222 --> 01:22:12.301
Simon shoots.
Simon has shot Vivian!

01:22:12.381 --> 01:22:14.941
Simon has shot Vivian
into second place.

01:22:15.022 --> 01:22:17.662
And Simon shoots himself.
Simon is third.

01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:21.182
And Nigel clubs himself
into fourth place!

01:22:21.222 --> 01:22:23.102
And so, the final result:

01:22:23.141 --> 01:22:25.021
first and upper class
twit of the year...

01:22:25.062 --> 01:22:27.101
Javais Brookhamster of Kensington...

01:22:27.182 --> 01:22:29.702
runner up, Vivian Smith Smythe Smith
of Mayfair...

01:22:29.781 --> 01:22:32.421
and third, Simon Zinc
Trumpet Harris of Kensington.

01:22:33.305 --> 01:22:39.348
