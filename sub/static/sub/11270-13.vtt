00:05.680 --> 00:09.595
You know, Sam,
this is my favourite time of day.

00:09.727 --> 00:11.594
What's that, Coach? Closing time?

00:11.729 --> 00:15.894
No. 1:37. I don't know.
There's just something about it.

00:16.026 --> 00:17.521
I know what you mean.

00:17.653 --> 00:21.402
I suppose we've all got
our favourite 1:37 story.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.906
What's your favourite time of day,
Sam?

00:24.745 --> 00:27.747
Gee, I don't know. 8:15's nice.

00:27.874 --> 00:31.707
Yeah. I used to like 8:5.
I think I kinda grew out of it.

00:35.675 --> 00:38.879
Wait a minute. Coach, Sammy.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.342
I don't want to be left alone
locked up in this bar all ni...

00:51.570 --> 00:53.978
<i>Quarter to three</i>

00:54.699 --> 00:58.365
<i>No one in the place except you and me</i>

01:03.042 --> 01:05.830
Once in a while, a man
needs a little time to himself.

02:21.848 --> 02:25.549
- Evening, everybody.
- Hi, Norman.

02:25.686 --> 02:26.765
Beer?

02:26.895 --> 02:28.604
Nah, I'd probably just drink it.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.439
What's new, Norm?

02:30.567 --> 02:33.734
I just came from a late lunch
at the Copley Plaza.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.907
You had lunch at the Copley?

02:37.033 --> 02:40.652
Yeah. I took a prospective employer
there. Courting the guy.

02:40.788 --> 02:44.453
- What did you have?
- The rack of lamb for two.

02:45.794 --> 02:47.537
Don't remember what he had.

02:49.757 --> 02:51.382
I saw Teddy Kennedy over there.

02:51.509 --> 02:53.668
Whoa. Norman, really?

02:54.471 --> 02:57.426
I still say that Kennedy will be
president some day.

02:58.685 --> 02:59.930
No, wait.

03:00.061 --> 03:02.635
Maybe even next time.
You know how politicians are.

03:03.315 --> 03:06.650
- Doesn't make sense.
- I really don't think so, Diane.

03:06.778 --> 03:09.815
I've got a pet little theory
about that.

03:09.948 --> 03:13.449
You see, if you go back in history
and take every president,

03:13.578 --> 03:17.197
you'll find that the numerical value
of each letter in their last name

03:17.332 --> 03:20.583
was equally divisible into the year
in which they were elected.

03:23.382 --> 03:25.588
So who's gonna win, Cliff?
Reagan again?

03:25.718 --> 03:26.500
Mondale?

03:26.636 --> 03:29.471
No. Not a chance.
See, I figured it out.

03:29.598 --> 03:33.762
By my calculations,
our next president has to be named

03:33.895 --> 03:35.888
Yelnik Mcwawa.

03:37.691 --> 03:39.898
That's the stupidest name
I ever heard.

03:40.027 --> 03:43.397
Sam, please. You're talking
about our next president.

03:44.533 --> 03:49.445
So, Norm. What was Kennedy
doing at the Copley?

03:49.580 --> 03:52.119
Having lunch. I got his autograph.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.493
You disturbed him during his lunch?

03:54.628 --> 03:57.250
No. God!

03:57.382 --> 03:59.873
I waited
till he went to the men's room.

04:00.385 --> 04:06.591
Mart... Martie Broder?
I got the wrong stall. I dunno.

04:13.610 --> 04:17.276
Ho, Cliff.
Isn't that Tibor Svetkovic?

04:18.156 --> 04:21.444
- Svetkovic, where?
- That's Svetkovic all right.

04:21.577 --> 04:25.577
Based on the fact that he has a long
name that you can all pronounce,

04:25.708 --> 04:27.286
I guess that he's an athlete.

04:28.086 --> 04:31.088
Or will he be president in 1990?

04:31.215 --> 04:35.130
Diane, the man was Czechoslovakia's
greatest hockey player.

04:35.887 --> 04:38.461
He defected to us
just to play in the NHL.

04:38.599 --> 04:40.592
It's an incredible story actually.

04:40.727 --> 04:44.097
He dressed up as a woman,
hid in a haystack,

04:44.231 --> 04:46.224
crawled on his belly
under barbed wire,

04:46.359 --> 04:49.811
swam a couple of rivers and stowed
away on a tramp steamer to get here.

04:49.946 --> 04:51.358
Amazing.

04:51.490 --> 04:55.536
The next week, the rest of his team
came over on the Concorde.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.414
That's what he gets
for not reading his schedule.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.699
Nobody said
he was a smart hockey player.

05:00.835 --> 05:05.379
Is this my day, or what? First
Teddy Kennedy now Tibor Svetkovic.

05:06.300 --> 05:10.001
You better memorise his shoes,
you might want his autograph later.

05:11.389 --> 05:14.475
Tibor, I see you play all the time.
I'm Sam Malone.

05:14.602 --> 05:17.272
Your problem may be
too much caffeine.

05:17.397 --> 05:18.263
Sorry, what?

05:18.398 --> 05:21.684
He's learning English
from TV commercials.

05:23.947 --> 05:25.738
And who are you?

05:26.325 --> 05:29.196
I'm Lana Marshall.
I'm Tibor's commercial agent.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.701
Is that right?
I'm Sam Malone, the boss here.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.157
You're the boss?

05:34.293 --> 05:36.202
You're gonna tell me what to do?

05:38.006 --> 05:40.544
Something tell me
you know what to do.

05:40.676 --> 05:42.300
I know what I like to do.

05:42.428 --> 05:43.258
That's nice.

05:43.387 --> 05:47.137
I like the lady who knows what she
likes to do and does what she likes.

05:47.267 --> 05:50.968
The mating ritual of
the horny-breasted lounge lizard.

05:52.732 --> 05:54.476
Two beers.

05:54.609 --> 05:56.353
Let me take care of you two here.

05:56.487 --> 06:01.363
- Tibor. Miller Time?
- TV! Yes, sir.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.699
- What can I do for you?
- What's your speciality?

06:04.830 --> 06:07.120
I do everything the same round here.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.002
- Great.
- Then why don't you surprise me?

06:10.128 --> 06:12.620
- It would be my pleasure.
- Mine too, I hope.

06:12.757 --> 06:15.379
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.

06:16.303 --> 06:19.055
She'll be here,
he'll be back and I'll be sick.

06:23.979 --> 06:30.482
So, you get jobs for professional
athletes to be in commercials?

06:30.612 --> 06:33.779
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I specialise in male athletes.

06:35.368 --> 06:38.820
Don't you know who you were
just talking to? That's Sam Malone.

06:38.956 --> 06:41.993
Cute guy. Too bad he has dandruff.

06:47.466 --> 06:51.299
- He used to play with the Red Sox.
- Really?

06:51.429 --> 06:53.007
Who does he play with now?

06:55.267 --> 06:59.100
You know,
you give broads a good name.

07:03.819 --> 07:08.529
Excuse me, could I ask you
a question about your boss?

07:09.869 --> 07:12.158
The king of the single entendre?

07:13.582 --> 07:17.746
Tell me, does he have a wife,
or worse, someone he cares about?

07:20.298 --> 07:24.048
He's available and very desirable,

07:24.178 --> 07:26.135
if lummox is your cup of tea.

07:27.307 --> 07:29.216
And it appears to be.

07:29.810 --> 07:33.595
Tibor, I think it's time
to get to the Garden.

07:34.899 --> 07:36.180
I'm late.

07:38.779 --> 07:40.653
After game, your room?

07:40.782 --> 07:43.534
No, Tibor,
I think I'm going to be busy tonight.

07:43.660 --> 07:46.116
OK, goodbye.

07:46.247 --> 07:48.999
And this concludes
another day of programming.

07:49.459 --> 07:52.461
Sooner or later,
you'll own General.

07:54.590 --> 07:57.508
Poor guy should really think
about wearing a helmet.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.270
I understand
that you were an athlete.

08:08.399 --> 08:10.143
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

08:10.276 --> 08:13.728
That's all right. I was a relief
pitcher before they became famous.

08:13.864 --> 08:17.281
- I missed it by a year.
- Have you done any acting?

08:17.493 --> 08:22.370
Well, you know, yeah, I have.
I had the lead in a school play.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.704
The one about the evil woman
who pushes her husband

08:25.837 --> 08:28.293
into getting rid of people
for more and more power.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.002
You mean <i>Macbeth?</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:33.753
No. <i>How Boots Fooled the King.</i>

08:34.556 --> 08:39.467
- Was that what <i>Macbeth</i> was about?
- Tibor's looking better, isn't he?

08:44.527 --> 08:47.528
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

08:47.656 --> 08:51.440
- Hey, Diane, we're talking here.
- She's talking.

08:51.577 --> 08:53.701
You're killing time between thoughts.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.324
You got a problem?

08:56.667 --> 09:00.167
Look, Sam. Just watch it, OK?

09:00.296 --> 09:02.788
She's not
one of your usual bimboettes.

09:02.924 --> 09:05.926
That's what I like about her.
She's got a lot of class.

09:07.096 --> 09:10.133
While I have never been
a big fan of the women you date,

09:10.267 --> 09:13.103
I will say that at least
they were too stupid to be harmful.

09:13.229 --> 09:15.269
I knew they'd grow on you.

09:20.404 --> 09:22.611
Is there something between you two?

09:23.366 --> 09:26.985
No. That's just business.

09:27.121 --> 09:30.906
I never mix in her personal life
and she mixes in mine.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.372
I've just been talking to my
secretary about the winter schedule.

09:36.507 --> 09:39.924
I think there might be some
commercials you might do very well.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.055
Me? You're kidding.

09:43.182 --> 09:46.137
No.
You have a very sexy, playful quality

09:46.269 --> 09:48.097
that would come across on camera.

09:50.775 --> 09:53.148
Wait,
I haven't played baseball for years.

09:53.278 --> 09:55.236
I'm not exactly a household name.

09:55.364 --> 09:59.279
Non-star athletes are in vogue.
They come across as regular people.

10:00.078 --> 10:02.237
What do you say, Sam?

10:03.958 --> 10:07.826
- I gotta think about it a bit.
- Come on, do it. You're a natural.

10:07.963 --> 10:11.048
Look at you. You're tall, handsome,
you got a great smile.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.133
Show her your smile.

10:13.762 --> 10:16.300
I'll be damned.
Who the hell was I thinking of?

10:20.478 --> 10:26.316
You know, I have to admit, all these
years watching those commercials,

10:26.444 --> 10:28.567
I always thought
I might be pretty good.

10:28.697 --> 10:30.571
Let's do it.

10:30.699 --> 10:32.692
Wonderful.

10:32.827 --> 10:35.365
Look, I'm staying at the Ritz.

10:36.122 --> 10:41.201
Why don't you come over later
and we'll work out the details?

10:42.005 --> 10:43.713
I don't get off until two.

10:44.299 --> 10:46.173
All the better.

10:49.681 --> 10:52.766
All these people at the bar
and no one introduced us.

10:53.811 --> 10:56.053
No, they didn't.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.190
I'd like to thank
each and every one of them.

11:03.323 --> 11:04.817
Me, too.

11:10.915 --> 11:16.337
<i>Now for Fields Light Beer,</i>
<i>former Red Sox pitcher, Luis Tiant.</i>

11:16.464 --> 11:20.249
<i>After the game,</i>
<i>I like to sit back, light up a cigar</i>

11:20.385 --> 11:22.094
<i>and enjoy a Fields Light Beer.</i>

11:22.221 --> 11:23.502
<i>Hey, Luis.</i>
<i>Hey, Sam.</i>

11:23.639 --> 11:26.131
<i>When you get to be my age,</i>

11:26.267 --> 11:29.269
<i>30, you don't want to get filled up.</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:34.020
<i>That's why I drink Field Beer.</i>
<i>It's refreshing, satisfying,</i>

11:34.152 --> 11:37.403
<i>and you don't full feel with Field,</i>
<i>you just full fine.</i>

11:39.659 --> 11:42.233
<i>Full feel with Field, you full fine.</i>

11:43.372 --> 11:46.955
<i>Sorry, Luis, I don't think</i>
<i>you've got it. I'm pulling you out.</i>

11:47.085 --> 11:49.457
- <i>Skipper, let me stay.</i>
- <i>Sorry, big guy.</i>

11:52.842 --> 11:54.669
<i>Go get them, Mayday.</i>

11:54.803 --> 11:57.128
<i>Now pitching, Sam Mayday Malone.</i>

11:58.140 --> 12:00.762
<i>Fields,</i>
<i>it's refreshing, it's satisfying.</i>

12:01.269 --> 12:04.852
<i>You don't feel full with Fields,</i>
<i>you just feel fine.</i>

12:04.982 --> 12:06.393
<i>Alright!</i>

12:06.525 --> 12:07.936
<i>Another save.</i>

12:09.612 --> 12:11.440
<i>I still get the win, don't l?</i>

12:16.287 --> 12:18.031
You were great.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.324
Coach,
two bottles of Fields right here.

12:21.460 --> 12:26.966
Normally I wouldn't use that to
shampoo my dog but you sold me.

12:27.092 --> 12:30.010
Sam, you could sell me
ice cubes in summer.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.463
You're in showbiz now.

12:33.058 --> 12:34.600
You're a star.

12:35.603 --> 12:40.230
Sam, could you introduce me
to Gene Tierney?

12:40.359 --> 12:44.025
- I don't know Gene Tierney, Coach.
- OK, be that way.

12:44.948 --> 12:47.273
Come on. How about a speech
from the big actor?

12:47.409 --> 12:50.743
Yeah, how did it feel
to see yourself up there, Sammy?

12:51.372 --> 12:53.828
It was nice. It was very nice, OK?

12:54.710 --> 12:58.578
I was afraid of this. We have
to sedate the man, he's hysterical.

12:58.715 --> 13:02.001
Sam, if there's anything you wanna
talk about, get off your chest.

13:02.135 --> 13:05.588
There's nothing I wanna talk about.
I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl.

13:05.723 --> 13:07.597
Just wait on some tables.

13:09.144 --> 13:10.010
Fine.

13:10.145 --> 13:13.681
Sammy, that agent of yours
is hotter than a pistol.

13:13.816 --> 13:15.774
She's really earning
her ten per cent.

13:15.902 --> 13:19.687
Listen, will you just leave me alone?
Please, got that? Leave me alone.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.906
- Sam, let's talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.828
It's important.
Come back to the office now.

13:32.965 --> 13:36.417
Sammy's in trouble
with Miss Chambers again.

13:36.553 --> 13:39.424
Sammy's in trouble with Chambers.

13:53.824 --> 13:54.855
What do you want?

13:54.992 --> 13:58.943
Sam, you're obviously unhappy
and everybody just wants to know why.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.453
I'm not unhappy.

14:01.584 --> 14:03.458
- You're not?
- No.

14:04.212 --> 14:07.213
- You're happy with the commercials?
- Yes.

14:09.635 --> 14:12.423
- Think you were good?
- Yes.

14:12.555 --> 14:14.595
- Really?
- Yes.

14:17.103 --> 14:18.514
Well, what is it, then?

14:20.649 --> 14:22.606
Are you happy with the money?

14:23.736 --> 14:24.815
yes.

14:26.573 --> 14:29.029
- Are you happy with the auditions?
- Yes.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.278
- Are you happy with your agent?
- Oh, God!

14:37.628 --> 14:41.247
The Dragon Lady.
Tell me about it.

14:41.383 --> 14:44.088
Why? You wanna hear me
say you were right?

14:44.929 --> 14:46.969
Of course not.

14:48.057 --> 14:51.890
Knowing that and knowing
you know it and are tortured by it

14:52.021 --> 14:54.014
is plenty for this country girl.

14:55.942 --> 14:59.727
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

14:59.864 --> 15:02.865
I do wanna help. Come on, let's talk.

15:05.913 --> 15:10.161
You wanna hear about my relationship
with another woman?

15:10.835 --> 15:14.620
Well,... Maybe...

15:15.550 --> 15:17.543
Maybe I should find a man out there

15:17.677 --> 15:20.714
who's intellectually capable
of helping you.

15:22.141 --> 15:25.842
All right, everybody line up
for the ugliest tongue contest.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.723
Alphabetically by height, over here.

15:33.864 --> 15:36.865
It appears that
all the other intellectuals are busy.

15:38.953 --> 15:41.077
You're sure you wanna hear this?

15:41.206 --> 15:43.876
I'll stop you
before I get the vapours.

15:46.337 --> 15:48.959
You see, my relationship...

15:51.552 --> 15:57.010
Lana and I are a lot friendlier
than most agents and clients.

15:57.977 --> 15:59.092
Friendlier?

15:59.228 --> 16:03.725
You know me. I'm never against
a wild night of friend-making, but...

16:08.615 --> 16:12.910
There's some... Now I feel that I'm
supposed to be friendly on demand.

16:13.371 --> 16:16.622
And you're afraid
she'll stop getting you commercials

16:16.750 --> 16:19.954
if you stop being friendly?

16:23.383 --> 16:28.046
When you play in the bigs like I did,
you get used to attention.

16:28.181 --> 16:33.093
When I stopped playing baseball,
I felt something missing in my life.

16:33.228 --> 16:37.144
I was just hoping that these
commercials would get it back for me.

16:38.068 --> 16:41.817
Sam, Lana gave me a message for you
but I can't remember it.

16:41.948 --> 16:43.407
- Lana's here?
- That's it.

16:45.118 --> 16:49.662
By the way, what are you two doing?
We got a lot of customers out there.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.876
I got a problem.
Diane's helping me talk through it.

16:53.003 --> 16:57.915
Look, Sam, let me tell you something.
You've faced a lot of tough problems.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.634
You always found a solution but
since Sir Isaac Hayes came along...

17:02.681 --> 17:05.683
No offence, Diane,
I love Sir Isaac Hayes,

17:05.810 --> 17:09.643
but since then,
it's been talk, talk, talk.

17:09.772 --> 17:12.098
This is a pretty complicated problem,
Coach.

17:12.234 --> 17:18.025
You see, Sam wants to break up
with Lana, and he knows he should,

17:18.159 --> 17:23.036
but he's afraid that he will
sacrifice his acting career.

17:23.165 --> 17:25.372
- See?
- I don't understand what's going on.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.992
Let me show you something.
Come right down here.

17:28.128 --> 17:31.416
Just, please, come right down
here. Stand right here, Sam.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.837
- Pick that up.
- What do you want me to do that for?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.929
Just pick it up.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.649
Now, get the hell out there and tell
her you're finished with her.

17:44.775 --> 17:46.898
Please tell him
it's more complic...

17:47.028 --> 17:48.902
Out. Hustle.

17:49.030 --> 17:50.940
What do you want me to do?

17:51.074 --> 17:52.948
Hustle. I mean it.

17:54.662 --> 17:58.992
That was wonderful. Somehow,
your instincts just told you...

17:59.126 --> 18:03.041
Button it up, Diane. We got
a lot of people out there. Move it.

18:03.172 --> 18:04.797
Right.

18:10.265 --> 18:12.507
Tell me something, Red.

18:13.268 --> 18:16.720
Are professional athletes better
between the old wamsuttas

18:16.856 --> 18:18.398
than ordinary men?

18:19.401 --> 18:21.773
I've had no experience
with ordinary men.

18:21.904 --> 18:24.905
Me neither, but I'm trying
to work my way up to one.

18:27.619 --> 18:32.697
Believe me, athletes take their pants
off one leg at a time, like anybody.

18:33.168 --> 18:35.327
They take off their pants?

18:43.764 --> 18:47.015
I'm glad you're here. There's
something I want to talk about.

18:47.143 --> 18:49.267
Sam,
what do you think of your commercial?

18:49.396 --> 18:52.932
- It was fine but listen....
- I thought it was wonderful.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.894
I've had lots of calls about you.

18:55.737 --> 18:58.145
- Calls?
- A lot of people saw you.

18:58.282 --> 19:00.109
And they liked what they saw.

19:02.370 --> 19:06.203
One of those calls was an offer
for you, a national commercial.

19:06.334 --> 19:09.834
It's big money,
and they want to fly you to Hawaii.

19:09.963 --> 19:12.633
You're going to do the commercial
with the Osmonds.

19:12.758 --> 19:14.169
The Osmonds.

19:15.219 --> 19:17.259
- The whole family?
- That's right.

19:17.389 --> 19:21.138
- Even little Jimmy?
- Well, we're hoping.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.726
Now, come on.

19:24.314 --> 19:26.354
Wasn't there something
I wanted to say?

19:26.483 --> 19:29.734
Later. We've got
to get some pictures for you.

19:29.862 --> 19:31.654
We should buy a new sports jacket.

19:31.781 --> 19:35.614
Afterwards, we can stop off
at the hotel for a bite.

19:35.745 --> 19:37.287
And a nibble.

19:37.413 --> 19:39.323
And a scratch.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.285
Coach.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.792
Sam, I'm getting real mad now.

19:46.341 --> 19:51.337
- Lana, we can't nibble any more.
- Why?

19:52.390 --> 19:54.882
I just don't feel right about it.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.022
I see.

19:59.983 --> 20:02.901
Does this mean
that you're no longer my agent?

20:03.195 --> 20:07.194
Sam, what kind of person
would I have to be

20:07.325 --> 20:10.078
to drop you as a client
just because of this?

20:10.204 --> 20:14.072
- A dragon lady.
- I'm no dragon lady.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.207
- Good.
- But I am gonna drop you.

20:18.422 --> 20:20.415
I've learned from past experience,

20:20.550 --> 20:23.551
once you've had an intimate
relationship with a client,

20:23.679 --> 20:27.013
you can't go back
to being just business associates.

20:27.141 --> 20:29.715
Perhaps it's time
for me to find a new face.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.349
My face is new.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.187
Good,
you still have time to return it.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.072
She's good, Sam.

20:41.284 --> 20:44.202
- So, that's it?
- Yep.

20:44.329 --> 20:48.328
Good luck in finding a replacement
for me in the Hawaii commercial.

20:48.459 --> 20:51.165
If it takes me
longer than six minutes, I'll quit.

20:52.881 --> 20:54.874
Boy, she is good.

20:56.010 --> 20:58.169
May I ask you a question?

21:02.059 --> 21:04.052
You want to know how he was?

21:06.189 --> 21:07.684
What?

21:08.526 --> 21:10.353
You think I'm gonna stand here

21:10.486 --> 21:12.894
and listen to you tell me
how good Sam was?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.399
Fair?

21:17.787 --> 21:19.365
What do you wanna know?

21:21.583 --> 21:23.991
I want to know
how you can live with yourself.

21:24.128 --> 21:28.423
I can't. That's why I like
having young athletes around.

21:28.550 --> 21:31.421
I've always been crazy about them.

21:31.554 --> 21:37.060
Sometimes when I'm with one, I swear
I can hear the crowd cheering.

21:39.647 --> 21:44.227
I could understand this behaviour
from an oversexed adolescent.

21:44.361 --> 21:50.366
- But you're..
- An older woman? Middle-aged?

21:50.494 --> 21:52.653
All the more reason
to grab some youth.

21:53.706 --> 21:57.787
There was a time in my life when men
would invent tricks and schemes

21:57.920 --> 21:59.248
to get my attention.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.050
Well, now I'm the one
who schemes to get theirs.

22:02.675 --> 22:04.752
That's not too unfair, is it?

22:06.055 --> 22:09.756
But don't be too concerned.
Someday, even that won't work.

22:11.478 --> 22:17.268
Don't judge me until the bloom
is off your rose, honey. Ta-ta.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.783
She is good.

22:27.164 --> 22:30.000
<i>Fields,</i>
<i>it's refreshing, it's satisfying.</i>

22:30.126 --> 22:33.246
<i>You don't feel full with Fields,</i>
<i>you just feel fine.</i>

22:33.380 --> 22:34.459
<i>Alright!</i>

22:35.424 --> 22:36.705
<i>Another save.</i>

22:41.473 --> 22:43.799
Come on, admit it. I was good.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.643
Come on, say it. I was good.

22:47.773 --> 22:50.062
- You were OK.
- I wasn't OK, I was good.

22:50.192 --> 22:52.435
What's it gonna do,
kill you to admit it?

22:55.282 --> 22:56.693
All right.

22:56.825 --> 22:58.154
You were...

22:59.037 --> 23:00.116
Good.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.660
Good.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.827
You were OK.

23:05.711 --> 23:08.333
You were good.
And you did the right thing.

23:08.924 --> 23:12.091
Thanks. Hey, listen.

23:12.219 --> 23:14.212
Before you came to work at this bar,

23:14.347 --> 23:18.428
I never thought that much
about morality and integrity.

23:19.395 --> 23:22.432
You made me aware of all that stuff
for the first time.

23:22.941 --> 23:24.139
Thank you, Sam.

23:24.985 --> 23:28.236
That's why I'm firing you.
You can leave your apron right there.
