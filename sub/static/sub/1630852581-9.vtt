00:02.000 --> 00:04.640
WOMAN SIGHS

00:02.000 --> 00:04.640
Where's Elsie got to?

00:04.640 --> 00:07.080
I told her to be
back by quarter-past.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.280
You know what she's like.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.800
What time is your train?
In about half an hour.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.160
You haven't seen my wallet,
have you?

00:15.160 --> 00:18.400
No, but if you insist on hiring
an ex-convict...

00:18.400 --> 00:20.200
Everyone deserves a second chance.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.800
Finbar's a good worker.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.720
He gives me the creeps.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.960
Those eyes...

00:24.960 --> 00:28.160
Sorry. I couldn't resist doing
an extra mile.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.400
Are you still seeing me
off at the station? Of course.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.400
Stop it. I know that look.
What?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.880
Staring at me like Mum used to.
I'm not a child. I know.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.960
Did you put the takings in the safe?
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll do it!

00:38.960 --> 00:41.320
What would you do without me?
We need to be going.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.160
Relax, there's plenty of time.
I just need to take a quick bath.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.640
Don't you dare!
You're so gullible!

00:46.640 --> 00:48.720
Just hurry up, will you?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.920
Now, you will be careful out there,
won't you?

00:50.920 --> 00:53.240
I'm moving to London,
not the Amazon jungle.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.640
Even so, a young woman alone
in a big city...

00:56.640 --> 00:58.080
SCREAMING NEARBY

01:07.640 --> 01:10.040
Blab to the police
and I'll kill ya.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.880
Elsie!

01:18.560 --> 01:20.240
Elsie...

01:56.720 --> 01:59.280
I thought you had
a conference in Oxford?

01:59.280 --> 02:01.720
Maintenance on the line.
All the trains cancelled.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.640
Well,
you're very welcome to join me.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.200
Sid is dropping me
off at the spa for the open day.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.720
There's free wine.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.880
Well...

02:11.880 --> 02:13.920
I could always check how Elsie is.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.040
I haven't seen
her in church for a while.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.000
In you pop.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.600
ENGINE REVS

02:23.080 --> 02:24.280
Idiot!

02:24.280 --> 02:25.960
He could have killed you!

02:32.440 --> 02:34.600
Oh, first time I've been to a spa.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.160
SID WOLF-WHISTLES

02:40.160 --> 02:43.440
Sidney, I thought you said
you needed to get back?

02:43.440 --> 02:45.240
I'm in no rush, Mrs M.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.000
Father Brown! Good to see you.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.840
Likewise, Captain Peters.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.400
So, what can I tempt you with?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.960
A massage or a dip in the mud bath?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.480
I'll keep my cassock on,
if you don't mind.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.000
I was hoping to have a word
with Elsie.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.160
I'm afraid she's gone out.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.920
Avoiding the guests.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.760
Mrs McCarthy said
she was still quite withdrawn.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.840
Unfortunately,
it's become a lot worse, Father.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.160
Ever since we found out that her
attacker is to be released soon.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.920
She's been counting down the days.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.960
Sidney Carter!

03:19.960 --> 03:23.080
HE CHORTLES
Look what the cat dragged home!

03:23.080 --> 03:25.680
I thought you'd moved to London.
Just back for a visit,

03:25.680 --> 03:29.040
and to help out with Sis's open day.
Oh, how long are you staying?

03:29.040 --> 03:32.200
A week or maybe even a month.
We've got open return, so...

03:32.200 --> 03:33.600
"We"?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.560
Oh... Oh! This is Serge.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.160
All right?Bonjour.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.760
Sid's an old friend.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.920
He taught me to drive.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.200
Forgive me, but I need to prepare
for my meditation class.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.520
Taught you to drive?
Well, I couldn't tell him

03:54.520 --> 03:56.800
what we were really up to
in your old van, could I? Hm.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.560
You two serious, then?

03:58.560 --> 04:00.920
God, no! I've only known him
a couple of weeks.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.000
He's penniless
and lives in a wigwam.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.800
HE SNORTS

04:03.000 --> 04:04.800
He's got to have something

04:04.800 --> 04:07.160
going for him, hasn't he?
Magic fingers.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.200
You should try one of his massages.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.000
You haven't changed.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.000
SHE CHUCKLES

04:12.000 --> 04:15.920
Meditation is a spiritual journey.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.880
Oh! Excuse me!

04:21.880 --> 04:23.040
Forgive me, mademoiselle,

04:23.040 --> 04:26.640
but it is important to feel
at one with the environment.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.680
Clothes have no place.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.640
GASPS AND APPLAUSE

04:34.640 --> 04:37.280
LADIES GIGGLE

04:38.880 --> 04:42.640
In the past, it'd be Elsie
going on stage, inspiring people.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.680
Mens sana in corpore sano.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.880
"A healthy mind in a healthy body."
Indeed. That was her mantra.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.280
Anyway, over the top we go!

05:00.280 --> 05:02.840
TAPS MICROPHONE, FEEDBACK SQUEAKS

05:02.840 --> 05:04.520
Ladies and gentleman!

05:05.920 --> 05:08.600
Welcome to the Yang & Ying open day!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.680
FEEDBACK SQUEAKS

05:08.600 --> 05:10.680
Sorry.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.560
I'm not sure how long
we can go on for, Father.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.200
Well,
you seem to have plenty of guests.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.480
They're here for the free wine.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.080
I'm no businessman,

06:05.080 --> 06:08.880
and without Elsie's drive, we get a
fraction of the clients we used to.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.080
Elsie!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.120
Finbar Finch,
they've released him early.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.680
What?! Are you sure? I saw him...!

06:16.680 --> 06:18.440
Perhaps we can talk to the police?

06:18.440 --> 06:20.440
And tell them what?
He's served his time.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.480
What makes you think he's
still dangerous?

06:23.480 --> 06:24.960
It's been four years.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.840
He swore he'd kill us
all for testifying.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.720
Perhaps that was just
said in the moment.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.280
What would he gain
by seeking revenge?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.760
He's unhinged! A maniac!

06:34.760 --> 06:37.640
Well, people can and do change.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.720
That's what I thought
when I gave him the job.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.720
Look where it got me.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.200
Whereabouts did you see him?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.400
He was working at Chaucer's
tea room.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.600
Well, he's seeking employment.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.000
That's a good sign.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.440
He's had time to think in prison.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.640
Perhaps he's trying to make
a new start. I hope so, Father.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.760
For all our sakes.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.360
Feel connected with nature.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.720
BELL TINKLES

07:15.520 --> 07:17.200
Absorb the energy all around.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.440
It belongs to you...

07:20.440 --> 07:23.200
So, he lives in a wigwam
and he wears yellow pants.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.520
Well, you can see why I like him.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.000
Breathe in...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.560
..and breathe out.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.680
Deeper.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.040
Keep your eyes closed and repeat.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.800
You need special attention.
What's he doing?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.680
Let me touch you with my magic
fingers. Oh, no, no, no.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.240
I'm not having that.
For goodness' sake...! Don't!

07:50.240 --> 07:52.240
Just leave her alone, yeah?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.920
What's it to you?!
I'm just saying.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.600
Occupe-toi de tes oignons!

07:57.600 --> 07:59.440
Put some clothes on.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.040
SCUFFLING, SPLASHING

08:04.040 --> 08:05.360
Oh, no.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.560
Oh!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.320
Look at me!

08:09.320 --> 08:11.280
Oh, my... Oh, my...

08:12.280 --> 08:13.720
..my dress...

08:20.040 --> 08:23.560
Lola! You've got it all wrong!
She was flirting with me!

08:23.560 --> 08:25.920
I made a big mistake
bringing you here.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.080
How can you say that?
I saw you. It's over.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.360
Please, Lola, don't be hasty.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.360
I want you gone. On the next train.
Lola...! Just go!

08:34.960 --> 08:38.040
Au revoir!Maudite sois-tu!
No idea what that means.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.640
You all right? Yes, fine.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.520
Lola, Finbar Finch is out of prison.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.800
Who's that, then?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.600
The one who attacked my sister.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.840
He struck her so hard
she now has seizures.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.560
He's back in Kembleford.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.080
Give me your keys.
Where are you going?

08:54.080 --> 08:57.480
To find him
and ask him to leave and stay away.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.720
I don't think that's the best idea.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.440
Lola...

09:01.440 --> 09:03.560
Finbar Finch doesn't scare me.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.960
Lola!

09:18.280 --> 09:19.760
Lola?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.320
Femme stupide!

09:49.160 --> 09:52.040
Elsie, I've been thinking...

09:54.560 --> 09:58.200
Maybe we should hire some security.
Maybe.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.120
We could perhaps ask Sid,
Lola's friend?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.160
The way he handled Serge.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.040
I'm sure he'd be all right with
a couple of pounds.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.440
What do you think?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.880
Now that Finbar Finch...

10:12.880 --> 10:14.440
Victor, please!

10:15.440 --> 10:17.400
Just...

10:17.400 --> 10:19.160
Just sort it out yourself.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.640
Of course.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.640
Just leave it to me.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.040
I wasn't sure you'd come, Father.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.160
Most people won't give me
the time of day.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.920
I'd invite you inside,
but it's a bit of a state.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.280
I hear you've found a job.
Yes.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.840
I just want to live a normal
life, Father.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.240
Be like everyone else.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.320
Why did you ask to see me, Finbar?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.040
Elsie Peters.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.600
I want someone to give her
a message.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.360
I assume she still is
one of your parishioners.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.160
Why don't you speak to her yourself?

12:38.160 --> 12:39.880
After what I done, I can't.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.240
She's very worried
about your release.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.720
There is nothing to fear.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.880
No?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.200
Something happened to me
inside, Father.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.320
There was a chaplain who
opened my eyes.You found God?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.600
No.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.160
He found me.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.000
I despise the person I was.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.200
The terrible things I done.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.840
I used to take so much pleasure
in hurting people.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.280
It's what I lived for.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.880
But not any more?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.280
That man no longer exists.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.200
Finbar Finch is dead.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.200
What is your message to Elsie?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.120
I just want her to know that...

13:36.120 --> 13:38.440
I won't come near her again.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.920
And that I am sorry.

I couldn't find him.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.920
Hm?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.120
You've got scratches.
It's from earlier.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.320
I was picking fruit for the lunches.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.960
Sid?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.280
Act normal.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.080
It's Mrs McCarthy,
she's on the warpath. Oh.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.880
Where've you been? I've been looking
everywhere for you.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.920
I needed some time alone.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.640
Why are your legs muddy?

15:18.640 --> 15:21.000
You've had another seizure,
haven't you?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.720
I fell down, but I'm fine now.
What, two in one day?!

15:24.720 --> 15:27.480
It's because of that monster
returning, isn't it?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.720
I need to change.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.920
Look, you don't have to
worry about Finbar any more.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.440
What do you mean?

15:33.440 --> 15:34.760
Just that.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.320
I'll protect you.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.600
I promise!

15:46.120 --> 15:47.640
Not a pretty sight, sir.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.560
Looks like he was
shot at close range.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.320
Stand aside.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.200
Are you all right, sir?

15:55.600 --> 15:59.040
It's just you look a little bit,
um... A bit queasy, sir.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.800
As an officer of the law,
I have an iron constitution.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.560
His name is Finbar Finch.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.400
I was talking to him,
moments before it happened.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.280
He was released from prison...
five days ago, sir.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.560
SHAKILY: Well, at least he won't be
reoffending.

16:20.560 --> 16:24.400
Did you see anyone else?
No, but I heard a car driving away

16:24.400 --> 16:27.080
and there are tyre marks
beyond the trees.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.440
There's also a shotgun shell, sir.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.200
Langbridge Ltd.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.120
Stepped out from behind the tree,
bang, straight in the kisser.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.240
Someone must have really
hated his guts.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.800
What's this?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.760
A ladies' brooch.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.120
Sidney Carter!

16:55.120 --> 16:57.160
God, here we go.
Oh, there you are.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.160
Mrs M, didn't see you there.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
Would you look at the state of me?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.480
Take me home!

17:02.480 --> 17:04.560
There's no need for that,
Mrs McCarthy.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.600
As compensation, I would like to
offer you a free beauty treatment.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.360
My dress is wet.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.720
I'll take care of that,

17:11.720 --> 17:14.920
and in the meantime, you can
relax in the hot-air room.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.160
In the hot-air...

17:16.160 --> 17:18.560
Well, that's very kind of you.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.120
Let's get you a robe.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.320
Elsie, Finbar Finch is dead.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.920
SHE GASPS

17:41.560 --> 17:43.600
Are you all right?

17:43.600 --> 17:46.880
Is it wrong to feel happy that
someone's dead?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.920
I suspect that what you are feeling
is relief,

17:50.920 --> 17:53.840
after years of dreading
Finbar's return.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.720
We're questioning anyone
who had a motive.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.960
So, tell me, do you own a gun?

18:02.960 --> 18:07.160
Yes. But, surely, you don't think
I've got anything to do with this?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.440
May I see it, please? What for?

18:10.520 --> 18:12.880
I have a licence. Where is it?

18:15.640 --> 18:17.480
I...I keep it behind the desk.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.160
Behind the desk?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.640
This place is hardly Fort Knox!

18:21.640 --> 18:23.040
Well, it makes me feel...

18:23.040 --> 18:24.960
It makes Elsie feel safe.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.160
It's gone.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.760
Who else knew it was there?

18:33.760 --> 18:35.080
Just my wife and...

18:36.960 --> 18:38.640
..her sister, Lola.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.000
What make of cartridges do you use?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.360
Langbridge.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.200
Do you recognise this?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.000
It belongs to Lola.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.320
It was found near Finbar Finch's
body.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.440
Thank you, Padre.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.840
And where was Lola around midday?

18:56.840 --> 18:59.360
Well, she took off in my jeep to...

18:59.360 --> 19:00.760
Yes?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.360
..to speak with Finbar Finch.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.360
< Looks like
we've got a murder suspect.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.000
WHISPERS: Lola!

19:18.880 --> 19:21.200
Constable, find Lola Briggit
and arrest her.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.480
Father, I've known Lola years.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.360
There's no way she's
capable of murder.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.040
Lola went off in the jeep
to confront Finbar Finch,

19:33.040 --> 19:37.520
but the tracks near his body
were from a car or a van.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.720
These are too wide.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.640
We've gotta tell the Old Bill that.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.720
Well, that's not enough
to stop her arrest.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.480
Then it's down to you, Father,
you've got to prove she's innocent.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.760
I need to go back to
Finbar Finch's caravan.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.320
All right.
I'll have a word with Mallory.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.400
Lola?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
I can't quite believe it.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.880
It took a girl to do what
I should have done.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.560
Lola... Keep your voice down!
Quickly.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.240
The police are looking
everywhere for you.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.520
You need to give yourself up.
Not a chance.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.960
You running away looks bad.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.680
So, what are you saying, that I
should hang for Finbar's murder?

20:24.680 --> 20:27.640
What? Just don't tell anyone
you've seen me.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.400
Did you do it? What?!

20:30.400 --> 20:32.800
Did you shoot Finbar Finch?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.440
How can you even ask that?

20:34.440 --> 20:37.280
Well, who hates him more than you?
Think about it,

20:37.280 --> 20:38.800
Finbar crossed a lot of people.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.280
He must have had plenty of enemies.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.720
But how did your brooch end
up next to his body? I've no idea!

20:44.720 --> 20:46.000
Sorry.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.520
Listen, Victor,
I don't know what's going to happen

20:49.520 --> 20:52.040
but I need you to take
care of Elsie. I always have...

20:52.040 --> 20:55.200
But this might send her
over the edge, you do realise that?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.680
I'm not as weak as you think I am.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.600
Elsie told you why I left the Army,
didn't she?

20:59.600 --> 21:02.120
It's got nothing to do with that.
I knew it.

21:04.240 --> 21:08.520
Listen, all I'm saying is,
if I go to prison or...

21:08.520 --> 21:12.920
..or the gallows, then you'll need
to be there for her.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.360
Show her how strong you can be.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.880
Can you do that?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.320
Victor?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.080
Yes.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.880
Good. Now, go to Elsie,
before anyone sees us.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.160
COCK CROWS NEARBY

22:00.640 --> 22:03.480
Afternoon, Sergeant. Father.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.960
Don't mind me.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.920
Hello?

22:26.920 --> 22:28.600
Sid.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.600
Got your note. I need your help to
get me out of here

22:31.600 --> 22:33.000
until they find the real killer.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.680
Yeah, well,
Father Brown is on it, so...

22:34.680 --> 22:36.440
FOOTSTEPS

22:36.440 --> 22:37.760
Mrs M!

22:37.760 --> 22:38.960
Oh, Sidney!

22:38.960 --> 22:40.760
Oh, you gave me a fright.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.920
Hold that.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.760
I thought you was...getting
a facial?

22:44.760 --> 22:49.480
No, no. Apparently, it's the
hot-room first and opens the pores,

22:49.480 --> 22:51.000
and then, you have the facial.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.880
More to the point,
what are you doing here?

22:53.880 --> 22:59.160
Oh, er... Captain Peters, he hired
me as a security guard, so...

22:59.160 --> 23:03.440
Oh. Yeah, I'm just checking
everything's as it should be.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.880
KNOCKS ON WALL

23:03.440 --> 23:05.880
Nice and secure.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.840
Yep, looks pretty safe to me.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.040
Sorry. Yes.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.840
Looking for clues, Sergeant?

23:26.520 --> 23:28.520
Inspector Mallory insisted
I go through

23:28.520 --> 23:32.800
all of Mr Finch's possessions.
Can I help?

23:32.800 --> 23:35.920
I don't think the Powers That Be
would appreciate your help, Father.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.800
No... And anyway, I'm all done here.
Just about to leave.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.000
Ah.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.600
You've got two minutes, Father,
then I'm locking up.

24:11.560 --> 24:16.160
"Yesterday, upon the stair,
I met a man who wasn't there.

24:16.160 --> 24:21.120
"He wasn't there again today,
I wish, I wish he'd go away."

25:03.960 --> 25:05.480
Victor...

25:05.480 --> 25:08.160
What are you doing?!
Just, I'm trying to show you that...

25:08.160 --> 25:09.640
You can be what? I can be...

25:09.640 --> 25:11.400
Aggressive?

25:11.400 --> 25:13.320
Lola is about to be
arrested for murder,

25:13.320 --> 25:15.320
and you're behaving like
some caveman!

25:15.320 --> 25:18.200
Elsie, I'm... Please,
I can't deal with this right now.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.720
Just tell the staff
and guests to leave.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.400
Elsie, look...

25:40.880 --> 25:44.520
Right, sir, nothing in the way
of evidence at Finch's caravan.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.800
There's been a development,
Sergeant... Over there.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.400
Flaming canaries!

25:49.400 --> 25:50.560
The murderer!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.520
Good afternoon, miss.

26:05.120 --> 26:09.040
Please tell me you've
found something?I'm not sure.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.360
The police have arrested Lola.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.200
I'll contact a solicitor.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.400
Elsie, does the poem Antigonish
mean anything to you?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.560
I've never heard of it.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.000
Would your sister be
capable of murder?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.880
I mean, Lola hated Finbar for what
he did to me.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.760
But murder?

26:27.760 --> 26:30.200
Do you know anyone else
with a motive?

26:30.200 --> 26:33.880
Only my husband and he's not
capable.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.680
He was discharged from the Army
because of his nerves.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.960
He froze whenever he tried to shoot
a gun. Go on, then!

26:39.960 --> 26:43.200
Tell everyone how useless I am!
That's not what I said.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.480
"Captain Coward",
that's what they called me.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.400
Captain Coward!

26:49.400 --> 26:52.320
HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

26:53.600 --> 26:55.160
What's wrong?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.240
Victor!

27:10.960 --> 27:12.640
Is he going to be all right?

27:12.640 --> 27:15.560
You'll need to speak
to the doctors at the hospital.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.160
Drinking on the job, Sergeant?

27:18.840 --> 27:22.160
Is that what the captain was
eating before he collapsed?

27:22.160 --> 27:24.680
We need to test it for poison,
Father.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.680
A lot of grated carrot.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.280
Now, you're a food critic?
Is there no end to your talents?

27:30.280 --> 27:32.280
Is that grated fruit?

27:32.280 --> 27:34.320
Peach or apricot.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.800
What?

27:35.800 --> 27:39.280
My husband never ate apricots, not
since he almost died from doing so.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.400
So, they're poisonous to him?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.320
Who prepared the food?

27:43.320 --> 27:45.480
Lola made the dishes this morning.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.160
She's a nutritionist.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.400
Looks like she was trying
to kill for a second time.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.080
Good job we have her in custody.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.240
But what would be her motive
though, sir?

28:00.240 --> 28:02.840
Perhaps Captain Peters
had crossed her in some way.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.640
Are you going to the hospital?

28:19.960 --> 28:21.880
I'll get a taxi later.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.280
I can't be around people
at the moment.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.320
I'm closing this place down.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.280
Wherever I look,

28:31.280 --> 28:32.720
I see him.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.120
Finbar Finch.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.800
He's always there.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.600
Inside me...

28:39.600 --> 28:41.040
..like a virus.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.000
That scarf.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.080
I think it belonged to Serge.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.360
He helped me bring the wine in
this morning.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.160
Father, you do realise that Elsie
is the only one left

28:56.160 --> 28:58.160
with an actual motive.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.160
And what about Lola?
She was hiding from the police.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.440
In my book, that spells guilt.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.920
Mrs McCarthy, why are you still
wearing your dressing gown?

29:08.200 --> 29:13.000
Because Sidney knocked me into the
mud, brawling with Lola's young man.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.840
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.520
That's cos he had a train to catch.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.400
Lola sent him
packing back to London.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.160
Trains aren't running. Well,
he could have got a bus or a taxi.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.760
Nah, he's skint.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.680
Lola had to pay for both
their tickets.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.400
He was in the spa kitchen
this morning,

29:30.400 --> 29:34.400
where Captain Peter's
food was prepared. Was he now?

29:38.560 --> 29:41.360
I think I'll see
if he's turned up in the village.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.760
"I met a man who wasn't there.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.960
"He wasn't there again today.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.680
"Oh, how I wish he'd go away."

30:11.640 --> 30:14.760
FINCH'S VOICE ECHOES:
I'll kill ya... I'll kill ya...

30:14.760 --> 30:16.440
I'll kill ya... I'll kill ya...

30:16.440 --> 30:19.600
I'll kill ya... Kill ya. I'll
kill... I'll kill... I'll kill ya.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.000
I'll kill ya.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.920
I'll kill ya...

30:28.480 --> 30:31.560
"The great dragon was cast out,
that old serpent,

30:31.560 --> 30:35.120
"who is called the devil and Satan,
who seduceth the whole world,

30:35.120 --> 30:36.840
"and he was cast unto the earth,

30:36.840 --> 30:39.120
"and his angels were thrown
down with him."

30:39.120 --> 30:40.800
You can't hurt me!

30:40.800 --> 30:42.080
You're dead!

30:52.800 --> 30:54.720
Rest in peace, Finbar Finch.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.600
Is it a puncture?

30:59.600 --> 31:03.920
I thought we had a puncture, but...
Oh, it's just a piece of glass.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.440
Problem?

31:07.880 --> 31:09.600
Looks like a piece of a bell.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.960
Like the one Serge
uses for his meditation class.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.240
Yes. Where is Serge?

31:16.080 --> 31:18.080
Is that blood?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.320
Maybe he's injured?

31:19.320 --> 31:20.760
Or killed.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.600
Ah, well,

31:23.600 --> 31:25.840
if that's the case, then the poem,

31:25.840 --> 31:27.760
the apricots and the receipt...

31:28.960 --> 31:31.200
It all makes sense. What receipt?

31:31.200 --> 31:34.000
For a new set of clothes. What?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.200
And Elsie is finally on her own.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.120
We need to get back.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.640
Well, can we still drive?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.000
We'll make it work, Mrs M.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.560
Who, are you?

31:58.560 --> 32:00.640
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

32:01.640 --> 32:03.400
I know who you are.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.120
You're the great Finbar Finch.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.880
No!

32:10.880 --> 32:12.800
SHE SOBS

32:10.880 --> 32:12.800
Elsie?

32:12.800 --> 32:15.280
Elsie, oh, heavens!

32:15.280 --> 32:19.200
Tell me, you were reading the poem,
Antigonish.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.200
Is that what gave you the idea
to fake your own death?

32:23.760 --> 32:25.440
A man who wasn't there.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.160
But to pull it off, you needed
someone

32:29.160 --> 32:30.880
of similar build and hair colour.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.280
Et voila!

32:32.280 --> 32:33.480
Serge.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.480
BLOW LANDS, GLASS SMASHES

32:48.480 --> 32:50.000
HE GROANS

32:50.000 --> 32:52.480
HE WHISTLES HAPPILY

33:07.200 --> 33:11.920
So, you shot him in the face
so he wouldn't be recognised.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.520
That is barbaric!

33:13.520 --> 33:17.800
After putting him
in an identical set of clothing

33:17.800 --> 33:20.320
and putting your documents
in his pocket,

33:20.320 --> 33:23.040
the first part of your plan
was complete.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
And the second part?

33:25.040 --> 33:29.520
To find a stolid, respectable
member of the public as a witness.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.600
So the Old Bill wouldn't
question who the body was.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.160
GUNSHOT, COCK CROWS

34:09.280 --> 34:11.880
ENGINE REVS

34:11.880 --> 34:15.440
Elsie, I'm taking you out of here.
You're not going anywhere.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.160
Haven't you done enough to Elsie?

34:18.760 --> 34:20.680
They took away four
years of my life.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.840
Planning my revenge
is what kept me sane.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.400
And, of course, if you were dead,
you couldn't be a suspect.

34:29.640 --> 34:33.920
And then, you were sat outside
your caravan, eating apricots,

34:33.920 --> 34:36.080
and you remembered,
from working at the spa,

34:36.080 --> 34:39.000
that they were poisonous
to Captain Peters.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.320
You must have watched the spa
patiently for days,

34:44.320 --> 34:48.200
waiting for a chance
to abduct Serge and kill him.

34:51.680 --> 34:55.480
The hangman's noose
around your sister's slender neck.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.920
And Elsie?

34:58.200 --> 35:02.680
Ah, oh, you've removed the door
handle from the inside.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.080
Cunning, no way out.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.840
A tragic accident.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.560
A tragic accident for all of ya.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.160
Now get inside!

35:24.400 --> 35:28.320
TAP SQUEAKS, STEAM HISSES

35:43.640 --> 35:44.960
Elsie!

35:47.240 --> 35:49.600
HE GASPS

35:55.280 --> 35:56.640
Elsie...

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
STEAM HISSES

36:01.440 --> 36:03.640
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

36:03.640 --> 36:07.840
I feel as if I'm suffocating
and I'm... I feel dizzy.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.480
Maybe I should have another
go at that door.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.880
It's reinforced.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.320
I need some water...

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
Take some deep breaths,
Mrs McCarthy.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.240
Look, she can barely breathe, we
can't just sit here and do nothing.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.680
No.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.960
In this heat,
we'll soon start to dehydrate.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.600
All we can do is pray.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.000
Yes.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.680
No offence or anything,

36:33.680 --> 36:36.680
but we need something a little bit
more than prayer.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.320
STEAM HISSES

36:38.320 --> 36:39.880
Warm air rises.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.360
If we could all lie on the floor,

36:41.360 --> 36:43.840
that would probably give us
some time.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.120
What now?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.920
Just lie here and wait to die?

36:56.520 --> 36:59.160
MRS MCCARTHY GASPS

37:02.040 --> 37:04.360
"Last night,
when I came home at three,

37:04.360 --> 37:07.000
"the man was waiting
there for me.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.800
"But when I looked around the hall.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.520
"I couldn't see him there at all."

37:17.640 --> 37:19.840
SHOTGUN COCKS

37:17.640 --> 37:19.840
You.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.640
Finbar Finch...at the window.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.680
There's nobody there, Elsie.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.480
It's no good,

37:35.480 --> 37:37.320
we're going to die.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.920
CLANKING

37:48.040 --> 37:50.120
MRS MCCARTHY BREATHES HEAVILY

37:50.120 --> 37:52.240
Pray for us.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.400
CLICKING

38:10.400 --> 38:12.160
HINGES SQUEAK

38:22.920 --> 38:24.520
You all right, Mrs M?

38:24.520 --> 38:26.320
Yes, I...I think so.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.160
ALL PANT

38:31.120 --> 38:34.440
Captain Peters.
MRS MCCARTHY: I'll call the police.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.480
You haven't got the bottle.
Oh, you think so?

38:38.320 --> 38:40.360
Don't pull the trigger.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.160
I can do it.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.680
You don't need to prove anything.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.320
Yes, I do.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.040
Elsie needs protecting.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.800
Let's ask her, shall we?

38:51.320 --> 38:54.240
Is this what you want, Elsie?
Revenge?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.080
Tell him not to shoot me.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.120
Why, should I?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.120
It's over, Elsie.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.160
Look at him.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.960
He can't hurt you now.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.480
Don't let him destroy who you are.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.840
Who I am?!

39:11.840 --> 39:13.400
You mean a coward?

39:13.400 --> 39:15.160
No.

39:15.160 --> 39:18.360
I mean, the kind and gentle man
I fell in love with.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.720
Listen to Elsie.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.920
You're not a killer.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.480
SCUFFLING

39:39.480 --> 39:41.440
Don't even think about it.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.360
Take your hands off me!
Oi! Now that's enough! Come on!

39:49.360 --> 39:51.120
I swear, I'll get you for this.

39:51.120 --> 39:55.320
Kill every last one of you
in your sleep.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.680
Pay no attention to him, OK.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.840
Don't look at me like that, Father.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.400
We're not that different.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.200
I'm a believer just like you.

40:03.200 --> 40:07.480
If that were true, then you would
willingly repent of your sins.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.160
"Better to reign in Hell,
than serve in Heaven."

40:12.160 --> 40:14.600
Milton, Paradise Lost.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.080
You do love your poetry, Mr Finch.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.400
Get him in the car, Sergeant.
Do you know who you're dealing with?

40:21.400 --> 40:24.040
I am the great Finbar Finch!

40:24.040 --> 40:27.640
I have to say, you're rather vocal
for a corpse. Get in there.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.000
CAPTAIN PETERS:
He's beyond saving, Father.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.720
Even the likes of Finbar Finch
were born innocent.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.760
I find that hard to believe.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.440
I've met his sort in the Army.

40:42.440 --> 40:47.240
Just cold-blooded killers
with no remorse and no guilt.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.840
We should get you back to the
hospital.

40:50.840 --> 40:55.280
I'm sure Sidney can give you a lift
after he's dropped Mrs McCarthy.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.120
Thank you, Father, for your help.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.000
Are you OK?

41:02.000 --> 41:03.280
Elsie?!

41:03.280 --> 41:04.440
What?

41:05.840 --> 41:07.400
Sorry.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.560
Elsie...

41:09.800 --> 41:12.640
..Finbar Finch won't be coming back
this time.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.600
ENGINE REVS

41:21.000 --> 41:24.640
Well, Sidney Carter, if it wasn't
for you, I wouldn't be here today.

41:24.640 --> 41:28.120
Don't thank me, thank Father Brown.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.480
ELSIE TAKES A DEEP BREATH

41:29.480 --> 41:32.320
You ready? No.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.360
Oh, you will be absolutely fine.

41:35.360 --> 41:39.600
That person you hid away four years
ago, we've missed her.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.720
Here at the Yin & Yang centre,

41:51.720 --> 41:55.240
we don't just
focus on your physical health.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.360
Our aim is for you to embrace
the authentic you.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.000
Sometimes...

42:05.440 --> 42:08.600
..you may feel
that you don't exist.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.120
But it's not true.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.920
Don't hide,

42:13.920 --> 42:16.080
don't cower,

42:16.080 --> 42:18.160
don't flinch,

42:18.160 --> 42:20.640
don't suppress,

42:20.640 --> 42:22.360
don't deny.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.040
Don't be silent,

42:27.040 --> 42:29.680
don't be scared,

42:29.680 --> 42:31.600
don't disappear.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.880
Don't be a shadow.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.880
DOOR CLANKS

42:41.400 --> 42:45.520
But most of all, don't be invisible.

42:46.960 --> 42:49.960
Celebrate your existence,

42:49.960 --> 42:52.600
and rejoice that you're alive.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
