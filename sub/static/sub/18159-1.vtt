00:24.604 --> 00:27.038
Do you know the difference
between being free

00:27.207 --> 00:28.196
and being high?

00:30.344 --> 00:32.174
Neither do I.

00:32.345 --> 00:34.940
Back in Texas, I knew everything.

00:35.882 --> 00:37.213
Because I'm from Texas.

00:38.618 --> 00:40.381
But that was before
any of this happened.

00:42.456 --> 00:45.050
It was a writing class
in junior college.

00:45.225 --> 00:47.557
We were studying
the elements of story...

00:53.834 --> 00:56.200
The acronym spells "sucker,"

00:56.370 --> 00:58.031
sort of.

00:58.205 --> 01:01.038
If you grew up in the setting of Houston

01:01.208 --> 01:03.574
believing the Astrodome
was visible from space,

01:03.744 --> 01:06.144
you, like me, are a sucker.

01:07.647 --> 01:09.478
If your parents have a conflict

01:09.649 --> 01:10.877
and your pothead father says,

01:11.051 --> 01:13.417
"I'll never leave you, little man,"

01:13.587 --> 01:16.579
you, like me, are a sucker.

01:16.757 --> 01:21.160
And if it takes you 19 years of Sundays
to figure this out,

01:21.328 --> 01:24.820
you, like me,
are a Southern Baptist.

01:28.245 --> 01:34.845
A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

01:44.084 --> 01:45.915
Hey, your mom asked me
to church on Sunday.

01:46.086 --> 01:48.554
Something about going-away ceremony?

01:48.722 --> 01:49.552
You want to come to that?

01:49.723 --> 01:51.247
I do if I'm sitting next to your mom.

01:51.425 --> 01:52.949
Aw, here we go.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.287
She ain't cheatin' on me, is she?

01:55.462 --> 01:58.022
Uh, these jokes never get old, Jordan.

01:58.198 --> 02:00.962
No. I bet it's that Mexican gardener.

02:01.134 --> 02:03.762
I seen him weed-whacking
outside your apartment,

02:03.937 --> 02:05.905
taking his shirt off all slow,

02:06.606 --> 02:07.732
like in the movies.

02:08.475 --> 02:10.636
Like if there's a sprinkler on him.

02:10.811 --> 02:12.972
Okay. I get the picture.

02:13.547 --> 02:14.536
Hey, he's cute, man.

02:14.714 --> 02:18.445
If I was your mom,
all hot and sex-starved,

02:18.985 --> 02:20.612
I'd let him pop my tart.

02:23.256 --> 02:25.224
Hey, party tonight at my house.

02:25.392 --> 02:26.916
Wine, cheese, hot babes,

02:27.093 --> 02:28.583
not that you'd be interested.

02:28.762 --> 02:30.423
Ah, I got a thing at church.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.087
Of course. Just 'cause you live there

02:32.265 --> 02:34.392
doesn't mean you shouldn't
get out once in a while.

02:34.568 --> 02:36.593
It's the junior high lock-in, man.
It goes all night.

02:37.070 --> 02:40.096
Come on, bro. How we gonna celebrate
your last day on the job?

02:41.274 --> 02:42.798
Ha ha! Follow me. Come on.

02:43.443 --> 02:45.138
Jordan!

02:45.312 --> 02:46.279
Jordan, come on, man!

02:46.446 --> 02:47.845
We're in our street clothes!
You're gonna get us busted.

02:48.014 --> 02:51.313
My best friend Don,
at the end of the line.

02:52.319 --> 02:53.251
Salute.

02:57.824 --> 02:58.813
Ha ha! Texas tea, brother.

02:58.992 --> 02:59.856
Dude, not cool. Bro.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.657
Oh, you want to dance?

03:01.828 --> 03:02.658
- Seriously.
- Look at you.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.421
- Don't mess around.
- Who said Baptists can't dance?

03:04.965 --> 03:06.956
Jordan, I'm gonna
make you drink that.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.294
I drink it all the time, bro.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.533
Confess your sins to each other,

03:12.706 --> 03:13.934
and pray for each other

03:14.107 --> 03:15.597
so that you may be healed.

03:17.043 --> 03:19.341
So does anybody need to be healed?

03:20.013 --> 03:21.378
All right, now why don't we focus
on where it says,

03:21.548 --> 03:22.378
"confess your sins."

03:22.549 --> 03:25.211
Does anybody have anything
they need to confess? Anybody?

03:28.555 --> 03:30.989
My family went to the beach,
and my dad took me out,

03:31.157 --> 03:32.954
and a huge wave knocked me
out of his arms,

03:33.126 --> 03:34.320
and he couldn't find me and stuff.

03:34.494 --> 03:37.622
He actually saw something pick me up
out of the water and take me to him.

03:37.797 --> 03:38.661
No way.

03:38.832 --> 03:41.027
I've had experiences with angels.
It's awesome.

03:43.003 --> 03:43.833
Ohh! Ohh!

03:45.005 --> 03:45.994
Who wants more sugar?

03:46.473 --> 03:48.634
Okay. All right.
Keep going. Keep going.

03:50.577 --> 03:53.705
It's still going? Must be some party.
Who all's there?

03:53.880 --> 03:55.006
Everybody.

03:55.882 --> 03:56.871
Tons of girls.

03:58.552 --> 04:00.520
Sorry, Jordo.
I'd come cheer you up,

04:00.687 --> 04:03.520
but right after this,
I got breakfast with The Hobo.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.851
Call you later.

04:06.026 --> 04:07.926
I gotta go at 6:00.

04:08.094 --> 04:09.755
- You bring my communion cups?
- Factory fresh.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.659
- They for tonight?
- Shh, shh.

04:12.699 --> 04:14.724
When you find out,
it's gonna blow your mind.

04:15.335 --> 04:16.666
So... got your car packed

04:16.836 --> 04:18.599
- for the big, bad university?
- Yep.

04:18.772 --> 04:21.002
Don't let 'em brainwash you, Donny.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.873
Well, it is a Baptist college.

04:24.044 --> 04:25.534
Yeah, but it's gotten way more liberal now.

04:25.712 --> 04:27.509
I mean, when I used to go there,

04:27.681 --> 04:29.512
the girls still had to wear heels,

04:29.683 --> 04:31.514
keep their knuckles
from dragging the ground.

04:32.786 --> 04:34.617
Don't tell my wife I said that.

04:34.788 --> 04:36.756
All right, who wants Kool-Aid?!

04:51.471 --> 04:52.733
Bebop?

04:52.906 --> 04:54.100
You've been listening.

04:54.274 --> 04:56.902
Yeah, when I'm not in the mood
for music, I put on jazz.

04:57.077 --> 04:59.238
Life is like jazz, son.

05:00.814 --> 05:01.940
Never resolves.

05:03.450 --> 05:04.712
You get the going-away
present I sent you?

05:04.884 --> 05:06.374
I read a few chapters.

05:06.553 --> 05:08.418
- You guys still friends?
- Oh, yeah.

05:08.588 --> 05:11.989
He just bought 30 acres
up in, uh, Oregon.

05:12.158 --> 05:13.819
He's a good writer
for being full of crap.

05:13.994 --> 05:15.256
Went to a good school.

05:15.428 --> 05:17.157
Ever heard of Reed College?

05:18.632 --> 05:21.066
Know what the average
IQ score is at Reed?

05:21.568 --> 05:24.628
138, 2 points above genius.

05:27.273 --> 05:28.740
You want a beer?

05:28.908 --> 05:30.773
I won't tell Jesus.

05:31.778 --> 05:33.075
No, thanks.

05:35.115 --> 05:37.606
So he's still connected at the school,

05:37.784 --> 05:42.016
and when he told me
he could pull a few strings,

05:42.188 --> 05:43.450
I, um...

05:45.925 --> 05:46.823
You what?

05:50.697 --> 05:51.686
I got you in, Donny,

05:53.099 --> 05:54.191
at Reed.

05:57.037 --> 05:58.527
You enrolled me?

05:58.705 --> 06:00.036
For this term?

06:00.206 --> 06:01.696
That's not how it works.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.537
Well, took some finagling.

06:05.545 --> 06:07.513
Even had to send 'em a deposit.

06:10.483 --> 06:11.609
I already got a scholarship,

06:12.786 --> 06:13.718
Trinity Baptist.

06:13.887 --> 06:15.047
So you can get
a preaching degree

06:15.221 --> 06:16.153
and make your mom happy?

06:17.290 --> 06:20.157
A brain like that
working for a church?

06:20.326 --> 06:23.227
You only believe that stuff 'cause you're
afraid to hang out with people who don't.

06:23.396 --> 06:24.454
I'm going for the writing program.

06:24.631 --> 06:25.563
Well, then go somewhere

06:25.732 --> 06:28.565
they don't hand you the script
and tell you to copy it.

06:29.669 --> 06:31.899
You hear that?

06:33.373 --> 06:34.840
That's free-form.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.533
Improvise.
Write your own damn story,

06:38.244 --> 06:40.007
or that kook mom of yours
will write it for you.

06:40.180 --> 06:41.010
Don't call her that.

06:41.181 --> 06:44.082
Yeah, or I'll be "left behind", right?

06:49.656 --> 06:51.351
Come on. Let me do this
for you, Donny.

06:51.558 --> 06:52.820
Why now?

06:52.992 --> 06:55.722
It's cheaper than having you
kidnapped and deprogrammed.

06:57.764 --> 07:00.062
All those years you were
dodging child support...

07:03.737 --> 07:06.103
our church paid for the groceries.

07:14.114 --> 07:18.016
- Who's that one?
- Intern.

07:19.886 --> 07:20.944
Thought you were on sabbatical.

07:21.121 --> 07:22.952
That's why I only have one.

07:23.523 --> 07:24.922
You want me to introduce you?

07:25.592 --> 07:26.718
You got a girlfriend yet?

07:27.127 --> 07:29.027
Hey, Lindsey,

07:29.195 --> 07:31.561
my Baptist son here
needs some tutoring.

07:31.731 --> 07:32.595
Dad.

07:42.275 --> 07:43.742
Here comes Sunday morning.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.915
You know what works
great with sunrise?

07:52.886 --> 07:55.446
A Love Supreme, John Coltrane.

08:04.430 --> 08:07.422
Pushes the sun right
out of the earth, huh?

08:29.422 --> 08:31.356
They have no regard for Jesus.

08:31.524 --> 08:33.515
These people have no regard
for common sense.

08:33.693 --> 08:34.955
They hate Christianity.

08:35.128 --> 08:36.993
Some of this they learn in the homes...

08:37.163 --> 08:40.131
Good morning, Mama.
Rise and shine.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.700
- What time is it?
- It's almost 8:00.

08:42.969 --> 08:45.335
I'll take the first shower.
You can sleep a little more, okay?

08:51.177 --> 08:52.769
Breakfast!

08:53.213 --> 08:55.841
Coming! Not too many bananas.

08:59.185 --> 09:00.675
You have one message.

09:00.854 --> 09:04.654
Señora, buenos noches.
Are you home?

09:05.358 --> 09:08.293
Ah, bella muchacha,
are you awake, mi amor?

09:08.962 --> 09:12.693
Sleep the sleep de los ángeles.
I'll see you mañana.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.999
" Yo te quiero infinito. "

09:16.236 --> 09:19.501
" Yo te quiero infinito. "

09:19.672 --> 09:23.836
" Yo te quiero, yo te quiero infinito. "

09:27.914 --> 09:29.211
Message deleted.

09:31.251 --> 09:33.549
You like it?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.687
Is that new?

09:34.854 --> 09:35.912
It's your big day.

09:36.856 --> 09:37.982
Any calls?

09:39.325 --> 09:41.691
Some Mexican guy
had the wrong number.

09:41.861 --> 09:43.522
Hmm.

09:44.530 --> 09:45.929
So how's your father?

09:46.099 --> 09:48.431
Huh? You really want to know?

09:48.735 --> 09:50.202
Not at all.

09:51.104 --> 09:53.572
That's third night in a row
with the TV on.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.264
Is that a record?

09:55.441 --> 09:57.409
Keeps me company
when you're not around.

10:00.346 --> 10:02.439
Everybody's been asking me,

10:02.615 --> 10:06.016
what am I gonna do with myself
when you're gone.

10:07.186 --> 10:10.019
Mom, it's not gonna be like that.

10:10.189 --> 10:12.419
I'm barely leaving the zip code.

10:12.592 --> 10:15.925
I'm sorry, Donny.
It's just hormones.

10:16.095 --> 10:18.086
Is my mascara running?

10:18.264 --> 10:20.255
You look beautiful, Mom.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.697
And nothing's gonna change.

10:24.404 --> 10:26.565
I'm always just a phone call away.

10:28.741 --> 10:32.905
Ephesians 6:11 tells us
to put on the full armor of God,

10:33.079 --> 10:36.071
but wearing God's armor
isn't always easy, is it, Don?

10:36.249 --> 10:37.409
No, sir.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.483
Your friends may not think you're cool.

10:39.652 --> 10:42.280
So when we dress you
in the full armor of God,

10:42.455 --> 10:45.288
it's not just a fun,
little going-away gift.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.722
It tells the world what, Don?

10:47.894 --> 10:49.885
Romans 1:16, sir.

10:50.063 --> 10:52.463
"I'm not ashamed of the
Gospel of Christ."

10:52.632 --> 10:54.725
Amen. Let's give him a hand, church.

10:56.135 --> 10:56.999
Give it up.

10:57.770 --> 10:59.795
Thank God. Appreciate it.

10:59.973 --> 11:01.235
All right.

11:01.407 --> 11:02.669
Now hold on. Hold on, folks.

11:02.842 --> 11:04.605
Hold on.
Donny, Donny, not so fast, bro.

11:04.777 --> 11:08.304
I'm gonna need my sidekick
for story time, kids.

11:08.481 --> 11:10.813
Come on down as my lovely wife
tickles the organ.

11:10.984 --> 11:13.111
Just gather round
right here in front of us.

11:13.286 --> 11:14.310
That's it.

11:15.755 --> 11:17.518
Ha ha. All right.

11:17.957 --> 11:21.154
Now, today we have a very special amigo

11:21.694 --> 11:23.787
who's come to listen to our story,
but he's a bit shy.

11:23.963 --> 11:25.863
Let's see if I can...

11:26.032 --> 11:27.932
Hey, hey, uh, Tito.

11:31.804 --> 11:32.793
Here he comes.

11:42.348 --> 11:45.442
Yes, today is Tito's birthday, but,

11:45.618 --> 11:47.882
oh, oh, but he's very sad.
You know why?

11:48.054 --> 11:51.046
'Cause today he learned
what happened on the cross.

11:51.224 --> 11:52.851
So for his birthday,
we're going to show Tito

11:53.026 --> 11:54.459
how the cross can
make him happy, yes?!

11:54.627 --> 11:55.855
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

11:56.029 --> 11:57.496
Yeah. All right,
let's bring down the cross.

11:57.663 --> 11:58.652
2, 3, go.

12:00.033 --> 12:02.024
That's my girl.
All right, here it comes.

12:02.535 --> 12:05.561
Look at this. Now we need
someone really, really strong

12:05.738 --> 12:06.636
to break down this piñata.

12:06.806 --> 12:07.636
- Who wants to do it?
- Me! Me!

12:07.807 --> 12:09.365
Who's really strong?
Are you strong enough?

12:09.542 --> 12:10.668
I don't know. I think...

12:10.843 --> 12:12.310
Smartacus here.

12:12.478 --> 12:15.003
Smartacus here,
he's got what it takes.

12:15.815 --> 12:18.978
Smartacus is going to use
his Sword of the Spirit,

12:19.152 --> 12:21.382
and he is going to give it his best shot.

12:21.554 --> 12:23.385
All right, buddy. There you go.

12:23.556 --> 12:26.218
That's it. Big swing, and...

12:26.392 --> 12:28.417
Oh, yeah.

12:29.395 --> 12:31.886
All right, Smartacus. Yeah.

12:32.899 --> 12:33.888
All right, boys and girls,

12:34.067 --> 12:36.865
What? What, were you
expecting something else?

12:37.336 --> 12:41.773
Yeah? See, just like the piñata
had to be broken to make candy,

12:42.008 --> 12:45.774
Jesus had to die on the cross
to make forgiveness for our sins.

12:45.945 --> 12:47.606
So, Tito, would you like to be forgiven?

12:47.780 --> 12:48.872
"Sí.."

12:49.048 --> 12:50.845
"Sí, sí, sí, señor Kenny.

12:51.017 --> 12:54.851
I want Jesus to be my amigo
for my birthday."

12:55.021 --> 12:57.717
" Yo te quiero infinito. "

12:57.924 --> 13:00.552
" Yo te quiero infinito. "

13:00.726 --> 13:01.590
" Yo te quiero. "

13:01.761 --> 13:04.093
" Yo te quiero infinito. "

13:06.099 --> 13:07.191
Right?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.094
Well, come on, boys and girls.

13:09.268 --> 13:10.200
This is better than candy.

13:10.369 --> 13:13.736
Grab the blood and body of Jesus,
and give it to all of Tito's friends.

13:13.940 --> 13:17.967
"Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias.
Go on. Go on. Do it."

13:18.144 --> 13:20.237
Like any good Southern Baptist,

13:20.413 --> 13:22.244
I've been trained
to assess awkward situations

13:22.415 --> 13:24.440
with the question,
"What would Jesus do?"

13:24.617 --> 13:25.743
Make sure and bring some to the choir.

13:25.918 --> 13:26.748
"Los cantantes.."

13:26.919 --> 13:28.045
But what would Jesus do

13:28.221 --> 13:30.246
if his mom was sleeping
with the youth pastor?

13:31.457 --> 13:32.321
Maybe he'd feel like a sucker,

13:33.793 --> 13:35.988
or maybe he'd just be pissed.

13:54.814 --> 13:55.906
What the heck?!

14:01.154 --> 14:03.315
- Don, Don, stop it.
- Son of a bitch.

14:03.489 --> 14:04.854
I don't know what's
gotten into your head,

14:05.024 --> 14:05.922
but it's not what you're thinking.

14:06.592 --> 14:07.957
I'm not thinking.

14:09.529 --> 14:10.962
That's why I'm leaving.

14:12.765 --> 14:15.666
"A brain like that
working for a church?

14:16.102 --> 14:18.195
"You only believe that stuff
'cause you're afraid

14:18.371 --> 14:19.963
to hang out with people who don't."

14:23.509 --> 14:25.875
Maybe for once in his life,
the old man was right.

14:27.613 --> 14:29.046
There's one way to find out.

14:57.009 --> 14:58.374
Message in your mailbox.

14:58.544 --> 15:00.205
Donny, I called your father,

15:00.379 --> 15:02.313
and he told me about
this Reed College.

15:02.481 --> 15:04.813
I'd like to talk about this
before we make a decision.

15:04.984 --> 15:07.179
Please call me back this time.

15:07.353 --> 15:08.820
Messages deleted.

15:28.874 --> 15:29.704
Man.

17:42.575 --> 17:43.564
Yeah, I saw it,

17:43.743 --> 17:45.301
but it's not like there was a nip slip
in there or anything.

17:45.478 --> 17:47.810
I mean, personally, I was like,
"Pfft, whatever."

17:47.980 --> 17:50.210
That was the nineties.
That was edgy back then.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.681
Come on. You got to
contextualize it historically.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.410
So she's breast-feeding a pig?
Big deal.

17:55.588 --> 17:57.556
That stuff was probably way common
during the Dust Bowl.

17:57.723 --> 18:01.090
It's a critique on the chauvinism
of the human species.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.249
How long you gonna be in there?

18:02.428 --> 18:03.656
What, are you taking a dump
or something?

18:03.829 --> 18:04.693
Till I'm done.

18:04.864 --> 18:06.695
Why don't you practice
that party trick of yours?

18:07.400 --> 18:10.233
You know, if queer theory
teaches us anything,

18:10.403 --> 18:13.201
it's that sexual identity
is a social construct.

18:13.372 --> 18:16.535
I mean, it doesn't matter
if she is or isn't.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.006
Her image in general

18:18.177 --> 18:20.771
and that image in particular
is transgressive.

18:20.946 --> 18:23.506
It's... It's deviant, it's out,

18:23.682 --> 18:25.707
and that's why our community
loves her.

18:25.885 --> 18:27.250
She's co-opting a fan base.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.716
You're acting like Tori Amos
is some kind of dyke messiah.

18:30.890 --> 18:33.017
Chill, Lauryn, okay?
I'm just saying.

18:33.726 --> 18:36.286
After all these years,
she's still kind of hot.

18:36.796 --> 18:38.525
What is she, like a B cup?

18:54.447 --> 18:57.541
Love is fleeting!
Herpes is forever!

18:57.716 --> 18:59.980
Put a jimmy on your stiffy!
Come on, now!

19:00.586 --> 19:02.076
You know you need one
for the chub.

19:02.388 --> 19:05.152
One size does not fit all!

19:05.324 --> 19:08.054
Love is fleeting, but herpes is forever!
Come and get 'em!

19:09.261 --> 19:10.819
Greetings, virgin.
How many do you need?

19:10.996 --> 19:12.088
- Huh?
- Rainbow ticklers

19:12.264 --> 19:14.994
are the special of the day.
Here. No charge.

19:16.402 --> 19:19.303
Rub-a-dub-dub,
put a rub on your chub.

19:19.638 --> 19:20.468
Right here!

19:20.639 --> 19:21.765
Chub away, rubber man.

19:22.775 --> 19:24.436
Got your hands full?

19:24.610 --> 19:28.307
Oh, why don't I just slide this
into your pocket?

19:28.481 --> 19:30.676
...right here. Absolutely free.

19:33.152 --> 19:34.642
One way or the other!

19:34.820 --> 19:35.946
Hey!

19:36.121 --> 19:38.612
Jimmy on your stiffy, ladies.
Take it.

19:38.791 --> 19:40.156
Want to try 'em out?

19:40.326 --> 19:42.920
Uh, I'm not 100%
on what I've got here.

19:43.095 --> 19:44.255
I meant the water.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.997
Uh, sure. Sure. What do I do?

19:48.167 --> 19:51.136
Take a sip.
Swirl it around in your mouth a bit.

19:53.372 --> 19:54.805
Okay, now try this one.

19:54.974 --> 19:56.202
What about this?

19:56.375 --> 19:57.364
Swallow.

19:59.545 --> 20:01.137
Well?

20:01.313 --> 20:02.644
I can't taste the difference.

20:02.815 --> 20:05.477
This one is Portland municipal tap water.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.175
This one is Aqualike bottled water.

20:07.353 --> 20:09.878
The Portland water is local
and comes with your tuition.

20:10.055 --> 20:12.853
The Aqualike water
costs $1.50 for a 12-ounce bottle,

20:13.025 --> 20:14.720
and they say it comes
from the Himalayas,

20:14.894 --> 20:16.156
but it actually comes from Kashmir,

20:16.328 --> 20:18.319
which is one of the poorest
regions in India,

20:18.497 --> 20:20.192
so that would be good
for their economy, right?

20:20.399 --> 20:21.661
Wrong.

20:22.468 --> 20:25.460
Aqualike Corporation practices
are actually depleting the water table

20:25.638 --> 20:28.539
so that the local Kashmirian farmers
don't have enough to irrigate their crops.

20:28.707 --> 20:32.234
Well, so then I shouldn't be
ingesting this?

20:32.411 --> 20:33.742
No.

20:36.515 --> 20:37.539
Here comes trouble.

20:41.654 --> 20:43.417
Oh, yeah.

20:44.523 --> 20:45.717
Yeah.

20:48.594 --> 20:50.721
They do this all the time?

20:52.197 --> 20:53.186
Hey.

20:53.866 --> 20:54.992
Heh. Hey.

20:56.201 --> 20:57.225
Hey.

20:59.104 --> 21:01.163
Okay.

21:13.285 --> 21:14.274
Wait up.

21:43.315 --> 21:46.375
Uh, anybody sitting there?

21:53.592 --> 21:54.559
Hey.

21:57.296 --> 21:58.126
I'm Don.

21:58.897 --> 22:01.263
We, uh, sort of met
in the men's roo...

22:01.900 --> 22:02.889
restroom.

22:04.903 --> 22:05.892
So where are you from?

22:06.071 --> 22:07.402
You know how to tell
if a girl's a lesbian?

22:09.608 --> 22:11.633
'Cause she's attracted
to other women?

22:12.511 --> 22:14.741
Is that how it works in Mayberry?

22:16.148 --> 22:17.581
Cutoffs at two o'clock.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.583
Last year, she was homecoming queen
back in Nebraska,

22:20.753 --> 22:24.484
two tiny biscuits floating
under a cheerleader skirt.

22:26.091 --> 22:27.683
What do you think her ass says now?

22:29.461 --> 22:30.587
Uh...

22:30.763 --> 22:33.027
It says, "I don't care what you think."

22:35.501 --> 22:37.093
Which is why it's beautiful.

22:49.348 --> 22:50.781
I'm Kent Bowers,

22:50.949 --> 22:52.974
and I am your
Dean of Student Affairs.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.619
Close your laptops.

22:56.789 --> 22:59.815
Pocket your cellphones.
Listen carefully.

22:59.992 --> 23:03.052
According to the words
and logic of Neil Postman,

23:03.228 --> 23:06.322
"There is no escaping
from ourselves.

23:06.498 --> 23:09.695
"The human dilemma is
as it has always been,

23:09.868 --> 23:11.165
"and we solve nothing

23:11.336 --> 23:14.737
by cloaking ourselves
in technological glory."

23:14.907 --> 23:16.135
At Reed College,

23:16.308 --> 23:19.141
there is no reward
for staring at a screen,

23:19.311 --> 23:21.506
no extra credit for looking busy.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.511
Forget everything
you think you know,

23:23.682 --> 23:27.174
because you do not know anything.

23:27.352 --> 23:28.683
There's nowhere to run.

23:29.321 --> 23:30.811
There's nowhere to hide.

23:30.989 --> 23:33.753
There is no escaping ourselves.

23:33.926 --> 23:37.418
The human dilemma
must be experienced.

23:41.033 --> 23:43.900
So, uh, that lecture
was pretty brilliant.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.168
How was it brilliant?

23:47.406 --> 23:51.934
Um, the whole part about how life
needs to be experienced.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.671
And technology influences
the way we think,

23:54.847 --> 23:56.178
and we live
in a dumbed-down culture,

23:56.348 --> 23:58.248
and, oh, the sky is blue.
Yeah, it's genius.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.044
Sounds like a high school term paper.

24:01.186 --> 24:02.084
What do you like?

24:03.856 --> 24:05.050
Choose wisely.

24:05.224 --> 24:06.054
A bagel, I guess.

24:06.225 --> 24:07.522
- This?
- Yeah.

24:12.931 --> 24:15.195
Someone ate this?

24:20.305 --> 24:23.468
Dude, check out Quinn.
I think it's growing.

24:23.642 --> 24:26.304
Heh. Bet you'd like
to pop her tart.

24:39.324 --> 24:40.484
Can you find me?

24:42.494 --> 24:44.086
That's you?

24:44.429 --> 24:45.623
You look so...

24:48.333 --> 24:50.995
Before I found freedom.

24:52.571 --> 24:54.835
Eat, girl. Eat.

24:56.441 --> 24:58.466
You want to tell me
where you're from now?

24:58.644 --> 25:00.077
Escaped from Kansas.

25:00.245 --> 25:03.112
Dad sells windows.
Mom bakes pies.

25:03.749 --> 25:04.738
She's fat.
He looks at other women.

25:04.917 --> 25:05.747
Where are you from?

25:05.918 --> 25:06.907
Texas.

25:07.786 --> 25:09.253
Can I ask you a question?

25:09.421 --> 25:10.581
'Cause it's been killing me.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.348
Sure.

25:12.524 --> 25:14.355
Are you the secret bastard child
of a televangelist?

25:14.526 --> 25:16.255
No.

25:16.428 --> 25:18.453
- Oh, my God. You are.
- What?

25:18.630 --> 25:20.791
Do all the boys in your choir
have to wear their hair that way?

25:20.966 --> 25:22.194
What's wrong with my hair?

25:22.367 --> 25:23.595
Well, it's not exactly free.

25:24.603 --> 25:25.934
Are you trying to make me a lesbian?

25:26.104 --> 25:27.594
I'm trying not to picture you

25:27.773 --> 25:29.866
burning flags at a gay soldier's funeral.

25:30.275 --> 25:32.038
Not all Christians are like that.

25:35.113 --> 25:36.375
Smile.

25:37.449 --> 25:40.350
You've got, like, spinach
stuck in your teeth.

25:40.519 --> 25:41.952
It's really gross.

25:42.387 --> 25:45.618
Look, your private religious wacko
beliefs are none of my business,

25:45.791 --> 25:47.782
but if you plan on sticking around.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.225
Long enough to unpack your secret
underwear or whatever,

25:51.396 --> 25:54.058
you probably want to keep that quiet
around here.

25:54.399 --> 25:55.627
You're kidding, right?

25:55.968 --> 25:58.129
I had a Mormon roommate
my freshman year.

25:58.303 --> 25:59.463
She lasted two days.

25:59.638 --> 26:01.833
I mean, we haven't had
a Christian club

26:02.007 --> 26:03.133
since the Nixon administration.

26:03.308 --> 26:05.299
Dude, this is Reed College.
Hello.

26:05.477 --> 26:06.739
I was looking at
this student handbook.

26:06.912 --> 26:08.903
You've got so many
crazy religious groups.

26:09.081 --> 26:12.676
"S&M Wiccans. Jews for Jihad."

26:13.018 --> 26:14.747
What's wrong with being a Christian?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.753
Do you have any idea what your hateful,
bullying tribe has been up to?

26:17.990 --> 26:21.721
'Cause around here, you represent
a whole new category of despicable.

26:21.894 --> 26:25.660
So if you plan on ever making friends
or sharing a bowl

26:25.831 --> 26:28.493
or seeing a human vagina
without a credit card,

26:28.734 --> 26:32.033
get in the closet, Baptist boy,
and stay there.

27:13.879 --> 27:18.612
Setting, conflict, climax, resolution.

27:19.818 --> 27:24.084
If the setting in SCCR changes,
does the conflict go away?

27:28.560 --> 27:31.256
'Cause, I mean, it's only been a week,
and I feel like I'm someone else.

27:32.664 --> 27:33.631
Hey, Jordan.

27:33.799 --> 27:34.823
You sounding chipper.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.298
I'm not disturbing you and your gay lover
roommate, am I?

27:37.469 --> 27:38.458
No, there's no roommates here.

27:38.637 --> 27:40.161
They're just single rooms.

27:40.339 --> 27:41.966
You got to pimp out your pad, dude,
catch some ladies.

27:42.908 --> 27:43.806
You getting any action?

27:43.976 --> 27:47.002
Uh, there's this one girl,
but I didn't get her number.

27:47.179 --> 27:48.168
Or her name.

27:48.347 --> 27:50.815
Spent some time
with a hot lesbian.

27:50.983 --> 27:52.473
Yeah, you're full of shit.

27:52.651 --> 27:54.243
Hold on, bro.

27:54.419 --> 27:55.943
Sorry, dude. It's my mom.

27:56.121 --> 27:58.351
- Are you talking to her?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're talking.

27:58.523 --> 27:59.512
- Sort of.
- Huh.

27:59.691 --> 28:02.023
- All right, call you later.
- Yeah.

28:06.298 --> 28:07.162
Hi, Mom.

28:07.332 --> 28:09.425
Hey. You get the cookies?

28:09.601 --> 28:12.126
Yeah, they came in the mail Friday.

28:12.304 --> 28:14.363
Sorry they were store-bought.

28:14.539 --> 28:16.871
Ah, store-bought or not,
they're still cookies.

28:17.042 --> 28:19.010
Sure is lonely here without you.

28:19.177 --> 28:20.667
Sorry that you're lonely.

28:20.846 --> 28:24.304
- You could always unenroll.
- No. I can't unenroll.

28:24.549 --> 28:27.040
- Why not?
- Because I like it here,

28:27.219 --> 28:29.847
and another 30-minute bitch session
is not gonna change that.

28:30.022 --> 28:32.957
- Uh, did you just call me...
- No, I'm not calling you that.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.558
I'm using it as an adjective.

28:34.893 --> 28:36.861
So is that what they're teaching
you at that school?

28:37.029 --> 28:39.395
Yes, Mom, that's what they're
teaching me at this school.

28:39.731 --> 28:41.198
You going to church anywhere?

28:41.366 --> 28:43.300
No, I haven't found a church yet.

28:43.468 --> 28:46.232
I'm looking for one with a really
dynamic puppet ministry.

28:46.405 --> 28:49.806
Stop with that. There's nothing
going on with Kenny.

28:49.975 --> 28:52.170
He's just helping me through a rough spell.

28:52.344 --> 28:55.177
I don't care if nothing's going on, Mom.
It's weird.

28:55.347 --> 28:58.510
He's a married man,
and he's not a licensed counselor.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.578
He's a pastor, Donny.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.919
- Donny.
- Huh?

29:03.321 --> 29:04.720
- Are you listening?
- Um,

29:04.890 --> 29:07.415
no, there's just a guy
dressed in a pope outfit

29:07.592 --> 29:09.389
pushing a burning shopping cart.

29:10.595 --> 29:12.529
Is that a Catholic school, Donny?

29:12.764 --> 29:14.891
Don't let them brainwash you.

29:15.067 --> 29:19.504
Can somebody tell me the difference
between archetype and stereotype?

29:19.671 --> 29:22.333
A stereotype is an archetype
with no sense of fashion.

29:23.075 --> 29:25.407
Come on. Give me some examples.

29:25.577 --> 29:27.568
Yuri? You want to join us?

29:29.281 --> 29:31.112
You want examples
from mythology?

29:31.283 --> 29:33.410
I'll take any literary example.

29:33.585 --> 29:37.214
Okay, um, archetype is
Emily Dickinson,

29:37.389 --> 29:39.789
and stereotype is Lisa Simpson.

29:39.958 --> 29:41.755
Nice, Penny.

29:42.761 --> 29:44.388
What about you, Don?

29:44.563 --> 29:48.522
Um, archetype is Tolstoy.

29:49.034 --> 29:51.696
Stereotype is, uh, Tolstoy.

29:53.138 --> 29:55.299
What do you know
about Russian literature?

29:55.474 --> 29:57.806
Yuri, everyone's entitled.

29:57.976 --> 30:01.377
Okay. Archetype is...

30:03.715 --> 30:04.545
Texan.

30:06.251 --> 30:07.548
Big car,

30:07.719 --> 30:09.482
tracks shit everywhere,

30:09.654 --> 30:12.452
closet racist, inbred...

30:12.624 --> 30:13.989
Ooh.

30:14.159 --> 30:15.285
Fundamentalist Christian.

30:17.562 --> 30:19.826
Okay, now you're insulting me.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.762
Notice he doesn't deny it.

30:22.934 --> 30:24.265
Oh, chill out, dude.

30:24.436 --> 30:25.960
There's plenty of Texans
who ain't Christian.

30:26.138 --> 30:27.332
Bonnie and Clyde,

30:28.173 --> 30:29.640
ZZ Top,

30:30.008 --> 30:30.940
David Koresh.

30:38.450 --> 30:40.350
I hadn't technically
denied anything.

30:42.287 --> 30:45.518
It just felt good to have people
laughing with me for once.

30:49.427 --> 30:53.761
You wake up here every day
feeling lost in a sea of individuality.

30:58.870 --> 31:01.202
Everyone here
seems so sure of themselves.

31:02.274 --> 31:03.866
Double... Hey, Penny.

31:04.042 --> 31:05.942
They have their own look.

31:06.111 --> 31:07.476
They occupy their own space.

31:07.646 --> 31:09.807
...whereas in a patriarchal society,

31:09.981 --> 31:13.144
our concept of God tends to mimic
the way we see our own fathers.

31:13.318 --> 31:14.307
Thoughts?

31:16.021 --> 31:18.990
Why would a loving God refer to himself
as "Father" anyways,

31:19.157 --> 31:20.954
when so many fathers
abandon their children?

31:21.560 --> 31:22.618
Seems like a marketing mistake.

31:24.196 --> 31:27.723
They reward you for asking questions
I'd never even thought of in Texas.

31:29.234 --> 31:30.861
I didn't care what it took.

31:31.036 --> 31:32.333
I just wanted to fit in,

31:32.504 --> 31:35.064
so I did what anyone else
in my position would do.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.502
I got drunk.

31:40.178 --> 31:42.169
- I had a lesbian take me shopping.
- Go.

31:42.881 --> 31:43.973
No.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.247
No.

31:46.418 --> 31:48.147
You're so soft.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.747
And I searched for the perfect
campus organization

31:52.924 --> 31:55.552
that would make me feel
like a bona fide Reedie.

31:57.596 --> 32:01.362
I, uh, got a notice
that Flag Football's been canceled.

32:01.533 --> 32:03.330
Lack of interest.

32:04.102 --> 32:05.262
In football?

32:05.437 --> 32:06.927
What's wrong? You lonely?

32:07.105 --> 32:08.834
Need a hobby?

32:09.841 --> 32:11.900
The human dilemma
must be experienced.

32:13.712 --> 32:14.838
Preferably for credit.

32:15.780 --> 32:17.543
Fire Juggling, full.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.583
Human Chess Club, full.

32:20.785 --> 32:23.549
Lamaze for Non-mothers, full.

32:24.789 --> 32:27.223
Malaysian Cocktail Tennis
has openings.

32:29.027 --> 32:31.120
Ball.

32:35.967 --> 32:37.628
My tennis partner is in rehab.

32:37.802 --> 32:38.928
Reflex Yoga, full.

32:39.104 --> 32:43.097
Sand Yoga, Hot Yoga, Partners Yoga, full.

32:43.642 --> 32:47.601
Vietnam War Reenactment needs a GI.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.551
Have you tried Civil Disobedience?

33:03.728 --> 33:04.820
For credit?

33:06.331 --> 33:07.320
Yeah.

33:09.234 --> 33:11.395
Okay, we go in two by two,

33:11.569 --> 33:13.298
one-minute intervals,
occupy all the aisles,

33:13.471 --> 33:15.837
especially the ones
near the cash register.

33:17.075 --> 33:18.940
And remember,
if anything goes wrong,

33:19.110 --> 33:21.271
Remulac-7 is going
to sound the alarm.

33:23.348 --> 33:26.181
And we will reconvene
at the cemetery across the road.

33:26.518 --> 33:27.348
- Okay?
- Okay.

33:27.519 --> 33:28.850
Okay. Let's do this.

33:38.363 --> 33:40.524
Hey, can I interest you in our
frequent buyers program?

33:40.699 --> 33:43.862
I'm just a robot. The franchise
tells me what to read.

33:44.135 --> 33:46.365
Please direct me to your restroom.

33:47.305 --> 33:48.499
Just back there.

33:52.210 --> 33:55.441
Corporations control you
through printed lies.

33:55.613 --> 33:57.513
Leave this store. Run now.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.293
"...little smidgens of fading heaven.

34:12.464 --> 34:16.025
Little cosmic mysteries plucked
from the starry, starry night."

34:16.201 --> 34:17.896
Attention, Books, Ink shoppers,

34:18.069 --> 34:20.902
Uh, you may have noticed some
alien life-forms roaming the aisles.

34:21.406 --> 34:22.235
Take me to your reader.

34:22.407 --> 34:24.500
I assume they, uh, mean us no harm.

34:27.212 --> 34:29.373
"You are precious
little cosmic mysteries."

34:29.547 --> 34:31.811
Just, uh...
Just kids having their fun.

34:31.983 --> 34:33.712
But if any of them
become a nuisance,

34:33.885 --> 34:36.183
be sure and let me know
at the front counter.

34:36.353 --> 34:38.879
Just, uh, come up, and, uh...

34:39.056 --> 34:40.524
Ignore him, corporate drones.

34:40.692 --> 34:43.559
We are taking over your so-called
knowledge repository.

34:43.728 --> 34:44.853
All right, just...
just give me the book.

34:45.029 --> 34:46.326
Hey, hey! This is a rental.

34:46.498 --> 34:47.931
Security. Mall security.

34:48.099 --> 34:50.329
Can we have security up here
at the front counter, please?

34:50.502 --> 34:52.732
Or across the front aisle.
Now he's in the main aisle.

34:52.904 --> 34:55.099
He's in the main aisle.
He crossed the main aisle.

34:56.940 --> 35:01.344
He's the, uh, only astronaut
in the pet care section.

35:01.513 --> 35:03.344
He's running like there's no gravity.

35:03.515 --> 35:04.948
Can anybody hear me?

35:10.121 --> 35:13.682
Hey, this is a robot invasion,
not an astronaut invasion.

35:14.025 --> 35:15.856
Yeah. When I went to the store,
they were out...

35:16.027 --> 35:18.257
I can't hear you.

35:18.430 --> 35:19.727
Don.

35:20.899 --> 35:22.890
I didn't expect to see you here.

35:23.067 --> 35:23.965
In gardening?

35:24.135 --> 35:25.762
No, at a robot invasion...

35:25.937 --> 35:27.905
in an astronaut costume.

35:28.807 --> 35:29.865
Do I look stupid?

35:30.809 --> 35:32.299
You just look like you don't belong.

35:36.481 --> 35:38.449
Which actually makes you
look kind of cute.

35:39.984 --> 35:41.417
Do you even know why we're here?

35:41.586 --> 35:42.712
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

35:42.887 --> 35:44.718
Uh, you're against something, right?

35:44.889 --> 35:47.050
We're also for a lot of things.

35:47.225 --> 35:49.386
Then what are you
doing in gardening?

35:49.561 --> 35:51.256
Anarchist's Cookbook
is on aisle five.

35:51.429 --> 35:53.795
Are you gonna play nice,
or am I gonna have to shut that visor

35:53.965 --> 35:55.091
and leave you on a planet to die?

35:55.266 --> 35:56.733
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, we're against gardening.

35:56.901 --> 35:57.925
It's consumeristic.

35:58.102 --> 35:59.592
- We're against gardening...
- No, gardening is fine,

35:59.771 --> 36:01.898
but there's a lovely independent
bookstore on Hawthorne.

36:02.073 --> 36:04.473
Don't let major corporations
tell you what to read.

36:04.642 --> 36:06.007
Or how to grow tomatoes.

36:06.978 --> 36:07.842
What?

36:10.748 --> 36:12.181
Oh, welcome to work, gentlemen.

36:12.350 --> 36:13.510
Did you enjoy your nap?

36:15.186 --> 36:17.984
Yeah, get rid of 'em.
Get 'em out of here.

36:18.156 --> 36:19.350
Look the door behind 'em.

36:20.358 --> 36:23.623
Yeah... Son of a...
Hey, come back!

36:29.000 --> 36:32.367
There. You want some?
I think you need some.

36:34.305 --> 36:37.468
I mean, what is the point
of all this stuff?

36:37.642 --> 36:40.475
Does anyone alive
even remember this guy?

36:40.645 --> 36:42.613
Oh, thanks.

36:43.982 --> 36:45.882
Why do you wear the same
clothes every day?

36:46.050 --> 36:46.948
I don't.

36:47.118 --> 36:48.449
It's a protest thing.

36:48.620 --> 36:49.951
Shut up.

36:50.121 --> 36:51.452
She's not buying clothes
for a year.

36:51.623 --> 36:53.648
What did clothes ever do to you?

36:53.825 --> 36:55.224
You wouldn't understand, Don.

36:55.393 --> 36:57.827
I want to do something
against something.

36:57.996 --> 36:59.725
Yeah, have fun with that.

36:59.898 --> 37:01.229
I will.

37:01.399 --> 37:04.027
Oh, hey, Quinn, wait up.

37:04.202 --> 37:05.965
Oh, dude, hey,
give me the bottle.

37:06.137 --> 37:07.195
Ah, there's none left.

37:07.872 --> 37:08.861
Come on. It's half full.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.473
Half empty. That's the way I...

37:11.009 --> 37:12.169
- What's that?!
- What the fu...

37:14.546 --> 37:15.740
Not funny. Whoo. Sorry.

37:15.914 --> 37:17.404
Ahh! Get away from me.

37:17.582 --> 37:19.516
Why do you want
to do something, Don?

37:19.684 --> 37:22.710
Uh, I don't know.
'Cause chicks dig it, right?

37:25.323 --> 37:28.815
- You know any dead people?
- Not personally.

37:28.993 --> 37:33.020
- Parents alive and well?
- Alive, not well.

37:33.197 --> 37:35.427
- Divorced?
- Aren't they all?

37:37.535 --> 37:38.763
Tell me about it.

37:41.773 --> 37:42.762
Come on.

37:50.682 --> 37:52.047
Mom got sick.

37:52.216 --> 37:53.274
She hears things,

37:53.451 --> 37:57.182
sees people that aren't there.

37:57.355 --> 37:59.448
You really want to hear all this?

38:01.626 --> 38:03.218
It started when I was seven.

38:03.394 --> 38:07.023
She thought the CIA was after her
for having an affair with JFK.

38:07.198 --> 38:08.688
That one might be true.

38:08.866 --> 38:09.855
Do the math.

38:11.269 --> 38:13.533
You want to know my favorite
memory of my mom?

38:13.705 --> 38:15.434
Don't laugh, okay?

38:18.042 --> 38:19.771
We would spend, like...

38:19.944 --> 38:22.105
half an hour
going through our hair,

38:22.280 --> 38:23.872
checking for microphones.

38:25.049 --> 38:26.880
She got diagnosed that year,

38:27.051 --> 38:31.317
but I still wanted to believe I had
microphones in my hair,

38:31.489 --> 38:33.923
because if I did,

38:34.092 --> 38:36.754
it would mean
I could keep my mom.

38:40.965 --> 38:42.557
I'm sorry, Penny.

38:43.601 --> 38:46.126
No, I mean it.
I'm really sorry.

38:53.811 --> 38:56.075
She says she didn't know
what was in the bottle,

38:56.247 --> 38:57.612
but I swear I tasted Red Bull.

38:57.782 --> 39:00.012
Or whatever I drank has me
feeling pretty good.

39:00.184 --> 39:01.116
Thanks for walking me home.

39:01.285 --> 39:02.616
Oh, yeah, sure. Anytime.

39:02.787 --> 39:05.017
Maybe I'll just power through
till morning.

39:05.189 --> 39:07.282
It's okay.
I got this from here.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.323
Okay. Nice dorms.

39:10.695 --> 39:11.923
Sorry.

39:12.096 --> 39:13.927
It's time for bed, Don.

39:15.967 --> 39:17.491
Hey, uh, there's a...

39:17.669 --> 39:20.160
There's a... Testing, one, two.

39:20.338 --> 39:21.498
Okay, good night, Don.

39:21.673 --> 39:23.038
I was just checking
for microphones.

39:23.207 --> 39:25.004
Hey, I can help you
with your box.

39:25.176 --> 39:26.165
I'll be fine. Thank you.

39:26.344 --> 39:27.174
Relax. I'll recycle it.

39:27.345 --> 39:29.040
I said I've got it, Don.

39:38.856 --> 39:41.620
Hey, uh, Penny.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.988
Hey, uh...

39:45.363 --> 39:46.193
Hey, I'm sorry.

39:46.364 --> 39:50.858
I-I'm not... I'm not like that.

39:51.035 --> 39:52.502
It's...

39:54.639 --> 39:57.403
Okay. Um...

39:57.575 --> 39:59.566
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

40:08.052 --> 40:09.713
Different war, same story.

40:09.887 --> 40:11.354
We do the bidding of the gods.

40:11.522 --> 40:13.353
It's always God's fault with you.

40:13.524 --> 40:15.014
I was actually talking
about Republicans,

40:15.193 --> 40:16.592
but I suppose you could
argue they're God's fault.

40:16.761 --> 40:17.989
What are the rest of you thinking?

40:18.162 --> 40:20.323
Is Achilles' army just dying for nothing?

40:20.498 --> 40:22.989
It's not for nothing.
They fight for glory,

40:23.167 --> 40:24.657
for family, for their culture.

40:24.836 --> 40:26.599
Come on. It's a culture war.

40:26.771 --> 40:29.035
Achilles' pride starts it.
The gods bless it,

40:29.207 --> 40:31.903
and mythology stokes up another
round of misery for everyone.

40:32.076 --> 40:34.442
Why do you always dismiss
all religious impulse?

40:34.612 --> 40:36.580
I grew up agnostic, but...

40:36.748 --> 40:40.514
I admire any religion that has
the balls to search for God.

40:40.685 --> 40:43.210
Yeah, because the Crusades,
those were very ballsy.

40:43.387 --> 40:44.786
You know nothing.

40:44.956 --> 40:46.617
My grandfather Topov

40:46.791 --> 40:50.192
was killed for smuggling an icon
out of Russia,

40:50.361 --> 40:53.023
for trying to preserve a way of life.

40:54.699 --> 40:59.534
Don, you're strangely quiet.
What do you think?

40:59.704 --> 41:02.400
I think that if it weren't for religion,

41:02.573 --> 41:06.907
Grandpa Topov might have preserved
his own life.

41:12.917 --> 41:14.475
Hey, by the way,

41:14.652 --> 41:17.246
it wasn't religion that
killed Yuri's grandfather.

41:17.421 --> 41:18.979
It was Stalin.

41:23.261 --> 41:24.990
Don't take it personal, Miller.

41:26.230 --> 41:27.492
Nerd babes.

41:27.665 --> 41:30.259
Many have tried. All have failed.

41:31.803 --> 41:33.668
There's just something
about her that I get.

41:33.838 --> 41:35.965
My dorm mate last year
thought the same exact thing.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.005
Rhodes scholar, Tall Biker,

41:38.176 --> 41:39.302
looked like Jeff Buckley,

41:39.477 --> 41:43.470
and if he couldn't bag that,
well, good luck.

41:43.915 --> 41:45.780
Tall Biker?

41:45.950 --> 41:47.941
My friend, the Reed College
Tall Bike Club

41:48.119 --> 41:51.350
is the apex of our prestige pyramid.

41:51.522 --> 41:54.787
It's like being captain
of the tennis team.

42:17.381 --> 42:18.848
Mommy, look.

42:34.732 --> 42:36.666
Hey, um, how much are these?

42:36.834 --> 42:38.461
- 15.
- Mom!

42:53.351 --> 42:54.181
Hey!

42:57.154 --> 42:59.054
Hey, stop that bear!

43:02.159 --> 43:03.387
Hey!

43:10.001 --> 43:11.195
Hey!

43:12.003 --> 43:13.698
What are you doing? Hey!

43:24.615 --> 43:25.673
Come on, man!

43:30.888 --> 43:32.515
Ohh!

43:34.959 --> 43:36.358
What did I do?

44:25.943 --> 44:30.141
This is literally the best water
you have ever had in your life.

44:30.314 --> 44:33.750
This bottle is not recycled,
but that is a good thing,

44:33.918 --> 44:36.819
because recycled bottles
equal dirty plastic.

44:36.988 --> 44:40.253
This is amazing.
It is bottled straight at the source.

44:40.424 --> 44:41.914
It's pretty much all I drink.

44:42.093 --> 44:43.754
- Everybody have one.
- Thank you.

44:43.928 --> 44:45.623
They're free. Merry Christmas.

44:46.831 --> 44:49.356
The place in the Himalayas
where they got it

44:49.533 --> 44:53.594
has actually been hidden
for the last 300 years.

44:54.138 --> 44:55.002
Hey.

44:56.273 --> 44:57.297
Can we talk?

45:04.682 --> 45:06.980
Looks easier from the ground.

45:07.151 --> 45:09.381
Yeah, we don't give spiders
enough credit.

45:09.553 --> 45:10.383
Sorry.

45:10.554 --> 45:11.816
Are you okay?

45:11.989 --> 45:13.684
Bear stole my bike
at the flea market.

45:13.858 --> 45:16.122
Aw, that's awful.
I didn't know they rode bikes.

45:16.293 --> 45:17.385
They do at the flea market.

45:18.629 --> 45:20.790
Bought you an early
Christmas present.

45:23.901 --> 45:25.960
It's okay.
It's just a little something.

45:26.137 --> 45:27.866
You celebrate Christmas?

45:28.039 --> 45:29.836
I'm sentimental that way.

45:30.741 --> 45:34.177
Your hands were cold
that night at the graveyard.

45:34.345 --> 45:36.677
And I know you're not
buying clothes this year.

45:36.847 --> 45:39.475
This was really thoughtful.
Thanks, Don.

45:41.385 --> 45:42.409
Merry Christmas.

45:42.586 --> 45:45.555
There we go. Swallow.

45:45.723 --> 45:46.690
It's so good.

45:46.857 --> 45:48.757
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.593
What are you doing
this weekend?

45:50.928 --> 45:52.896
Studying. You?

46:01.205 --> 46:02.229
I have to...

46:05.009 --> 46:08.035
Don, feet on the wall,
and lean back.

46:08.212 --> 46:09.679
I thought you said you were certified.

46:09.847 --> 46:12.611
I am, on the climbing wall
at Fun-world.

46:12.783 --> 46:14.842
I got the card in my wallet.

46:15.019 --> 46:17.954
I... I think that my spray adhesive
is coming off.

46:18.122 --> 46:20.181
Tori to Amos. Tori to Amos.

46:20.357 --> 46:22.291
- I was kidding. I'm okay.
- Come in, Tori.

46:23.227 --> 46:24.558
Do you hear sirens?

46:24.728 --> 46:26.127
Affirmative.
What's going on down there?

46:26.297 --> 46:28.629
May want to pick up the pace.

46:33.704 --> 46:35.365
Donald Miller.

46:49.954 --> 46:52.718
I may agree with the sentiment
of your protest.

46:52.890 --> 46:55.484
I may even agree in principle
with your activism,

46:55.659 --> 46:59.425
but the school cannot condone
the destruction of private property,

46:59.597 --> 47:01.462
no matter how just the cause.

47:10.307 --> 47:12.400
Hey, guys, take a look.

47:12.576 --> 47:14.567
Quinn, check this out.

47:18.015 --> 47:20.609
I suppose you all could use some lunch.

47:31.629 --> 47:34.530
I got a call from Aqualike’s
publicist this morning.

47:34.698 --> 47:37.861
They decided that some sales
just aren't worth it.

47:38.035 --> 47:39.525
Speech! Speech!

47:39.703 --> 47:41.102
Speech! Speech! Speech!

47:41.272 --> 47:44.332
Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

47:45.843 --> 47:47.003
Come on. Go.

47:49.847 --> 47:52.441
Well, last night was
my first time in the big house.

47:54.485 --> 47:56.976
And I'm not gonna make
the standard joke

47:57.154 --> 48:00.555
about who made me
their, you know, girlfriend.

48:03.527 --> 48:06.325
Where I come from, we do crazy things
for the hell of it,

48:06.497 --> 48:08.556
but last night was the first time

48:08.732 --> 48:11.394
I felt like what I was doing
meant something.

48:11.569 --> 48:13.867
So thanks for bailing us out.

48:16.407 --> 48:21.310
But I'd especially like
to thank our ringleader, Penny.

48:25.316 --> 48:26.408
Thanks.

48:47.571 --> 48:49.198
Hey.

48:49.373 --> 48:50.533
There you are.

48:54.378 --> 48:56.107
I was looking for you.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.372
Hey.

48:58.949 --> 49:01.611
You missed the part
where I thanked you.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.452
You mean I missed your speech?

49:07.258 --> 49:09.852
Hey, Penny,

49:10.027 --> 49:12.052
what's with you?

49:12.229 --> 49:13.457
We got arrested.

49:14.965 --> 49:16.933
Okay, so maybe I like the attention.

49:17.101 --> 49:19.592
Maybe you just like feeling better
than everybody else.

49:19.770 --> 49:20.759
Nice umbrella!

49:22.439 --> 49:23.804
What was that all about?

49:23.974 --> 49:26.101
People in Portland don't use umbrellas.

49:26.277 --> 49:27.266
That's dumb.

49:28.779 --> 49:30.246
Penny.

49:30.414 --> 49:31.745
Hey.

49:31.915 --> 49:33.382
Are you mad?

49:36.153 --> 49:40.419
Do you really think I do all of this
to feel superior?

49:40.758 --> 49:41.986
No.

49:42.459 --> 49:44.051
I mean, it's just...

49:44.228 --> 49:45.991
you're so good that...

49:46.830 --> 49:50.163
I guess you can't help making other people
feel like shit sometimes.

49:50.401 --> 49:51.663
That's all.

49:53.070 --> 49:56.267
If you're trying to seduce me,
it's not working.

49:56.573 --> 49:58.905
I'll work on it over Christmas break.

49:59.943 --> 50:01.638
So when do you head home?

50:01.812 --> 50:03.677
I think I'm just gonna hang out here

50:03.847 --> 50:06.338
since home feels
about a million miles away.

50:06.517 --> 50:09.179
- You?
- I'm taking a little trip.

50:09.453 --> 50:11.250
Where you going?

50:11.422 --> 50:13.083
India.

50:13.590 --> 50:14.614
The country?

50:15.492 --> 50:17.756
Yeah, my dad asked me
what I wanted for Christmas,

50:17.928 --> 50:20.260
and I've always wanted
to go there, so...

50:20.431 --> 50:22.661
Gonna sabotage
Aqualike’s pipeline?

50:22.833 --> 50:25.927
Actually, I'm gonna be
working in a refugee camp.

50:28.005 --> 50:29.597
I'm sorry if that
makes you feel like shit.

50:31.175 --> 50:33.268
Have a good Christmas, Don.

50:35.346 --> 50:36.938
I'll think about what you said.

50:38.449 --> 50:39.313
Pen.

50:40.150 --> 50:41.811
You want to keep the umbrella?

50:42.853 --> 50:43.979
No.

50:50.127 --> 50:51.958
Message in your mailbox.

50:52.196 --> 50:54.824
Donny, I know it's a long drive,

50:54.998 --> 50:57.626
but we've never been apart
for the holidays.

50:57.801 --> 51:02.135
And I can't bear the thought
of Christmas without you.

51:02.473 --> 51:05.306
Please call me
and tell me you got this.

51:05.476 --> 51:07.535
Message deleted.

51:21.058 --> 51:22.252
90 minutes till Christmas, friend.

51:25.229 --> 51:26.526
Maybe this'll get me in the mood.

52:03.700 --> 52:04.530
Jordan?

52:04.701 --> 52:06.794
Merry Christmas, dude.

52:10.641 --> 52:11.767
You look good.

52:11.942 --> 52:12.966
I got some beer.

52:13.143 --> 52:14.110
Do you?

52:25.088 --> 52:26.555
I read on the Internet

52:26.723 --> 52:28.714
there's something in turkey
interferes with the patch.

52:28.892 --> 52:31.053
- You started smoking?
- No, I stopped chewing.

52:31.895 --> 52:33.988
Remember my little stunt
the last day on the line?

52:34.164 --> 52:35.495
- Yeah.
- Well, couple months later,

52:35.666 --> 52:38.134
they're having this big outdoor
youth rally in Australia...

52:38.302 --> 52:40.270
or Austria, something...
for the Pope,

52:40.437 --> 52:41.904
Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians.

52:42.072 --> 52:45.098
They're passing out, like, 100,000
of them porta-cups for Mass.

52:45.275 --> 52:47.243
Hey, guess what's in one of 'em.

52:47.411 --> 52:48.935
No way.

52:49.112 --> 52:52.275
Some nun got sick drinking
the Skoal-tainted blood of Christ.

52:52.449 --> 52:53.507
No!

52:53.684 --> 52:55.447
'Course it gets traced
back to the shop.

52:55.619 --> 52:57.416
Boss is pissed.

52:57.588 --> 53:00.318
He was ready to swab everyone's cheek,
get their DNA.

53:00.491 --> 53:01.981
That's when I fessed up.

53:02.159 --> 53:02.989
They fired you?

53:03.160 --> 53:04.149
Hell, yeah, they fired me.

53:04.328 --> 53:05.522
Best thing that ever happened to me.

53:05.696 --> 53:09.598
Next Sunday, I go to Mass
for the first time since I was a kid.

53:09.833 --> 53:12.461
I figure I owe the Pope one,
you know.

53:12.636 --> 53:14.001
Well, don't laugh,

53:14.171 --> 53:16.639
but when I go up for Communion,

53:16.807 --> 53:20.538
it's like Jesus is whispering to me
from inside the cup.

53:20.711 --> 53:22.110
Really?

53:22.279 --> 53:24.713
I swear to God, I can hear him

53:24.882 --> 53:27.510
telling me the same thing
my mama used to say.

53:27.684 --> 53:29.447
"Don't shit where you eat."

53:31.989 --> 53:35.823
Anyway, I find out that the nun,
the one who got sick,

53:35.993 --> 53:38.655
live up in Canada
running a home for retards.

53:38.829 --> 53:41.059
Except you ain't
supposed to call 'em that.

53:41.231 --> 53:44.064
Don't laugh!
But I felt like God

53:44.234 --> 53:45.792
wanted me to even things up,
you know.

53:45.969 --> 53:47.960
So I call her up,

53:48.138 --> 53:50.538
and after talking to her
on the phone for 10 minutes,

53:50.707 --> 53:52.470
she said I need to be there.

53:53.844 --> 53:56.870
So I'm off to Canada
to help the retards.

53:59.483 --> 54:01.314
Come on. You're into this stuff, right?

54:04.488 --> 54:07.013
Merry Christmas, dude.

54:07.190 --> 54:08.316
What?

54:11.061 --> 54:12.756
What do you say we don't go
to midnight Mass somewhere,

54:12.930 --> 54:14.397
give old baby Jesus a holler?

54:14.565 --> 54:15.725
I'm not really dressed.

54:15.899 --> 54:17.594
Come on, man.
Ain't like your church.

54:17.768 --> 54:19.167
Not even the priest wears a tie.

54:19.336 --> 54:21.736
Nah, I'm not really interested.

54:21.905 --> 54:23.031
'Cause it ain't Baptist?

54:25.842 --> 54:26.900
You all right, big guy?

54:27.077 --> 54:28.874
So when do you start
up in Canada?

54:29.046 --> 54:31.674
Not until February.
I saved up a little money.

54:31.848 --> 54:33.679
I was thinking maybe I'd
kick it around here a while,

54:33.850 --> 54:35.943
assuming you got a spare floor.

54:36.119 --> 54:38.952
Uh, bro, my, um...

54:40.290 --> 54:42.258
You know, I'd totally let you crash,

54:42.426 --> 54:44.121
but my roommate's coming back early.

54:45.629 --> 54:47.722
Ah, that's cool.

54:47.898 --> 54:51.197
I was thinking that maybe
I'd head up there early.

54:51.368 --> 54:53.859
They got these cabins
where the volunteers go

54:54.037 --> 54:56.232
for these three-day silent retreats.

54:56.406 --> 54:59.569
Heh. I can't shut the hell up
for five minutes.

54:59.743 --> 55:02.439
I figure I might need
a few practice runs.

55:03.614 --> 55:05.582
You still got
my cell number, right?

55:05.749 --> 55:08.115
'Cause I tried
calling you a few times.

55:08.285 --> 55:09.809
School has been,
like, really crazy.

55:11.221 --> 55:12.984
Yeah.

55:13.156 --> 55:14.418
Yeah.

55:14.591 --> 55:15.956
Well...

55:16.126 --> 55:18.924
I guess I'm gonna go wish
Jesus a happy birthday.

55:20.430 --> 55:21.419
Peace.

55:23.333 --> 55:25.096
See ya.

55:25.268 --> 55:27.099
It was good seeing you, man.

55:27.270 --> 55:29.261
Yeah. Hey, thanks for coming, Jordan.

55:33.810 --> 55:35.107
Hey, merry Christmas.

56:12.349 --> 56:14.112
Here it is again!
Bullshit bookmobile!

56:14.284 --> 56:15.444
Welcome back, Reedies.

56:15.619 --> 56:17.712
It's that time of year
again to donate

56:17.888 --> 56:19.685
those Christmas presents
you are never gonna read!

56:19.856 --> 56:22.154
Come on. You know your
parents only gave 'em to you

56:22.325 --> 56:23.553
because they are easy to wrap!

56:23.727 --> 56:25.524
Give 'em the demise
they so richly deserve!

56:25.696 --> 56:26.788
Put 'em out of their misery!

56:26.963 --> 56:28.362
Give me your tired,
your poorly written,

56:28.532 --> 56:31.729
your huddled mass media
yearning to be trees!

56:31.902 --> 56:34.166
Miller, you look lost.

56:34.337 --> 56:35.201
- Me?
- Yeah.

56:35.372 --> 56:37.203
Ah, it's just a beer buzz.

56:37.374 --> 56:38.534
How was Christmas break?

56:38.709 --> 56:40.176
I don't do Christmas.

56:40.343 --> 56:41.401
What you got going later?

56:41.578 --> 56:42.977
Sleeping off a holiday hangover.

56:43.914 --> 56:46.144
I have a little project
that might require your...

56:46.316 --> 56:48.181
special talents.
What do you think?

56:48.351 --> 56:49.340
What?

56:50.687 --> 56:52.154
Trust me. It's big,

56:52.322 --> 56:53.482
very big.

56:54.424 --> 56:55.755
Texas big!

57:10.173 --> 57:11.697
What the hell?

57:14.745 --> 57:16.007
Lauryn?

57:16.179 --> 57:18.272
She's straight.

57:18.448 --> 57:19.915
What?

57:20.083 --> 57:21.948
Quinn is straight.

57:24.020 --> 57:25.954
She doesn't even experiment.

57:27.124 --> 57:30.252
I know I told myself
I'd give it six months,

57:30.427 --> 57:33.089
just to see if she
showed any sign.

57:34.598 --> 57:36.293
And then I...
I caught her reading

57:36.466 --> 57:38.434
an Anais Nin book
in the campus bookstore.

57:38.602 --> 57:39.899
I just assumed.

57:42.105 --> 57:43.572
Wouldn't you assume?

57:45.142 --> 57:47.303
Told you her ass
wasn't big enough.

57:47.611 --> 57:49.306
Stop, Don. I'm serious.

57:52.449 --> 57:54.314
I mean, I love her.

57:58.755 --> 58:00.416
Can I stay here tonight?

58:02.459 --> 58:03.619
Will you put out?

58:04.494 --> 58:05.552
No.

58:06.329 --> 58:08.320
Then leave immediately.

58:12.969 --> 58:15.802
Come on. Think back
to when you were bi-curious.

58:15.972 --> 58:18.236
Think back to when you were nice.

58:21.745 --> 58:24.908
I just don't understand
what girls see in you guys.

58:25.081 --> 58:27.276
So you can move heavy objects?

58:27.450 --> 58:28.815
Big deal.

58:28.985 --> 58:31.419
Are there that many heavy
objects that need moving?

58:32.956 --> 58:35.948
I heard the penis plays
a role in procreation.

58:37.661 --> 58:39.754
Genitals are overrated.

58:39.930 --> 58:41.420
So is Anais Nin.

58:41.598 --> 58:43.657
Yeah.

58:49.272 --> 58:50.933
I'm sorry, Lauryn.

58:51.341 --> 58:53.775
Oh, man, it just sucks.

58:53.944 --> 58:55.206
Yeah.

59:22.405 --> 59:24.396
- Are you ready?
- What?

59:24.574 --> 59:27.509
- Oh, come on.
- Not you, too.

59:27.677 --> 59:29.508
Junior college transfers.

59:29.679 --> 59:30.976
What are you doing?

59:31.147 --> 59:33.138
I'm purging the campus
of false dogma,

59:33.316 --> 59:36.683
but I didn't think for a second
that you were gonna need my help.

59:36.853 --> 59:39.822
Do you know the Stone Age tribes
of New Guinea do not have cellphones

59:39.990 --> 59:41.719
because they never grew wheat?
Did you know that?

59:41.892 --> 59:42.859
I didn't get that far.

59:43.026 --> 59:43.856
Now you know.

59:44.027 --> 59:45.085
Hey, those cost money.

59:45.862 --> 59:47.056
I'm The Pope, man.

59:47.230 --> 59:49.198
I speak for God.

59:49.366 --> 59:50.856
God wants you to burn books?

59:51.034 --> 59:54.526
God doesn't exist,
and here is the proof.

59:54.704 --> 59:57.400
Would a loving God possibly
allow this to exist?

59:57.574 --> 59:59.007
I think not.

59:59.175 --> 01:00:01.006
That was a graduation gift.

01:00:01.177 --> 01:00:02.007
Who made you Pope, anyway?

01:00:02.178 --> 01:00:05.113
Last year's Pope at Renn Fayre.

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.341
You don't know about any of this?

01:00:09.519 --> 01:00:12.545
Big weekend bash after exams
at the end of the school year.

01:00:12.856 --> 01:00:15.051
Sex, drugs, naked elves.

01:00:17.227 --> 01:00:18.854
The firstjob of the new Pope

01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:21.589
is to take confessions
during Renn Fayre, so...

01:00:21.765 --> 01:00:23.255
go to a little booth,

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:26.596
and all the students line up
to confess their sins.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.203
They confess to you?

01:00:29.439 --> 01:00:30.269
All night long.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.270
At first, I thought,

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:32.373
"This is gonna be awesome.

01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:33.634
"I mean, I'm gonna hear about

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.869
every kinky sex act
from here to Seattle,"

01:00:36.046 --> 01:00:38.139
and I got a lot of that,
but then...

01:00:42.152 --> 01:00:44.882
this one sad bastard,
he starts telling me

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:47.080
how when he was a kid,

01:00:47.257 --> 01:00:51.091
this priest at his church
used to take him into his office,

01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:52.626
you know, and...

01:00:53.997 --> 01:00:56.295
right there under the crucifix,

01:00:56.466 --> 01:00:58.434
Father Feel-you-up would just...

01:01:01.171 --> 01:01:02.502
go at him.

01:01:05.008 --> 01:01:06.839
It was heavy.

01:01:08.345 --> 01:01:09.937
So I start thinking, right?

01:01:10.113 --> 01:01:12.343
I should be doing something
to help these people.

01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:15.848
I mean, I got the robe.
I got the hat. I'm The Pope.

01:01:16.019 --> 01:01:18.954
I should be using my powers for good.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.621
So then I get the idea.

01:01:22.792 --> 01:01:27.161
I start getting people to tell me
right there in the confession booth,

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.628
"How has God screwed you up?"

01:01:31.134 --> 01:01:33.466
And maybe it's the PCP talking, but...

01:01:35.005 --> 01:01:43.005
I find out how afraid people are
of a God who doesn't even exist.

01:01:47.617 --> 01:01:48.777
Oh, don't touch those albums.
Hey. Come on.

01:01:48.952 --> 01:01:50.886
You know, tomorrow
millions of people

01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:52.885
are gonna start filing into churches

01:01:53.056 --> 01:01:54.353
and praying that their loving God

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:56.492
is not gonna burn them
in Hell forever.

01:01:56.659 --> 01:01:58.627
And you think burning books
is gonna help?

01:01:58.795 --> 01:02:01.821
It's not like I'm torching
anything useful.

01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:03.863
Every steeple
hides a sleeper cell.

01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:05.467
They smile,
They shake your hand,

01:02:05.635 --> 01:02:07.000
and then you're drinking
the Kool-Aid.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:09.138
They want to rule us,
Donny boy.

01:02:09.305 --> 01:02:10.533
They're like Taliban in training,

01:02:10.707 --> 01:02:14.199
and we've gotta stop 'em, you know,
combine all our resources.

01:02:14.377 --> 01:02:16.971
Street theater. Civil unrest.
You know what I mean?

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:20.475
I don't want to scare you,

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:21.742
but there's a lesbian in your bed.

01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:24.686
Oh, man, I need a beer.

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:26.082
Get your shoes on, Miller.

01:02:27.357 --> 01:02:28.517
I've got something planned

01:02:28.691 --> 01:02:30.488
that's gonna make
your little billboard escapade.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.685
Look like frat boys
TPing the dean's house.

01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:40.862
You want civil unrest at 4 A.M.?

01:02:41.037 --> 01:02:43.028
You're okay with heights, right?

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.405
What is it, Daddy?

01:02:49.579 --> 01:02:53.538
It's a, uh, balloon,

01:02:53.716 --> 01:02:55.707
a happy balloon.

01:02:55.885 --> 01:02:58.410
"Don't let

01:02:58.588 --> 01:03:00.522
"these people...

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.521
re-prod-uce."

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.221
Very good, Sophie.

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:16.539
Hey.

01:03:16.706 --> 01:03:18.037
When'd you get back from India?

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.903
- Was it you?
- Huh?

01:03:20.076 --> 01:03:21.941
The condom and the steeple.

01:03:22.112 --> 01:03:22.942
Are you wearing a wire?

01:03:23.113 --> 01:03:24.603
Answer the question.

01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:26.214
So you saw it.

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:29.715
I go to church there, Don.

01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:30.716
You what?

01:03:30.887 --> 01:03:31.876
You heard me.

01:03:34.491 --> 01:03:36.982
Well, it's not like we did
any permanent damage.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.492
I had a six-year-old ask me why the cross
was wearing a baggie.

01:03:40.763 --> 01:03:41.752
It's supposed to symbolize...

01:03:41.931 --> 01:03:43.125
A condom on the steeple?

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:44.391
It was just a...

01:03:44.567 --> 01:03:45.397
"Don't let these people reproduce"?

01:03:45.568 --> 01:03:46.557
It was just a joke.

01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:48.294
What do you know
about those people?

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:50.931
Whatever, you know?

01:03:51.107 --> 01:03:53.507
People can do what they want,

01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:55.337
believe what they want.

01:03:55.678 --> 01:03:57.339
It was just a joke.

01:04:00.316 --> 01:04:01.840
I'm sorry, all right?

01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:05.016
I had no idea you even went to church.

01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:14.959
You really believe
all that stuff, huh?

01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:15.961
Don't patronize me.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.830
I don't mean to.

01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:20.595
It just seems a little primitive
to still be a...

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:21.794
A Christian?

01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:23.933
Well, yeah.

01:04:24.107 --> 01:04:25.665
I wasn't born that way, Don.

01:04:25.842 --> 01:04:28.538
I read the Bible in Lit class last year,

01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:30.338
and it turns out I like Jesus.

01:04:30.513 --> 01:04:32.003
A lot.

01:04:32.982 --> 01:04:35.007
Does anybody know?

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.884
Are you gonna turn me in?

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:41.052
You know what? I'm leaving.

01:04:41.224 --> 01:04:42.782
H-Hey, Penny.

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:45.519
How was India?

01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:48.892
It was life-changing.

01:04:49.065 --> 01:04:50.657
Did you take pictures?

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:55.403
Yeah. I'm doing a slide show
on Sunday night.

01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:56.732
I'll come.

01:04:58.474 --> 01:05:00.567
Do you forgive me
for the steeple thing?

01:05:01.578 --> 01:05:03.978
It's not about me, Don.

01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:06.481
You don't even
really know what you did,

01:05:06.649 --> 01:05:08.378
because you don't know
the people that you hurt.

01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:11.813
Well, maybe I can meet these people.

01:05:11.988 --> 01:05:13.751
I'm not asking you to do that.

01:05:13.923 --> 01:05:17.051
No. It's my idea.

01:05:17.227 --> 01:05:18.319
I want to.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:24.764
Okay.10:30, next Sunday.

01:05:58.868 --> 01:06:00.233
Hi, Mom.

01:06:00.403 --> 01:06:01.597
Hi, Don. Is this a good time?

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:02.601
Not good.

01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:04.137
On my way to church,

01:06:04.307 --> 01:06:05.433
believe it or not.

01:06:05.608 --> 01:06:07.872
Don, I have some hard news...

01:06:08.044 --> 01:06:08.908
Hold on.

01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:12.542
Am I on speakerphone, Don?

01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:14.546
- You there?
- Am I... Am I on speakerphone?

01:06:14.717 --> 01:06:16.480
It's fine, Mom. Nobody's around.

01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:19.486
Don, can you take me
off the speakerphone, please?

01:06:19.656 --> 01:06:21.988
Fine. Okay,
I'll take it off speakerphone.

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:30.829
What's wrong?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.060
Don, I have some hard news.

01:06:34.237 --> 01:06:36.671
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

01:06:38.341 --> 01:06:39.774
I'm pregnant.

01:06:42.278 --> 01:06:45.475
I'm pregnant,
and the baby is Kenny's.

01:06:45.648 --> 01:06:47.013
Oh, God.

01:06:48.017 --> 01:06:49.143
It was a mistake.

01:06:49.319 --> 01:06:50.684
- What?
- I made a mistake.

01:06:50.853 --> 01:06:52.411
- Hypocrite!
- We made a mistake.

01:06:52.588 --> 01:06:53.953
Bitch!

01:06:54.123 --> 01:06:56.591
I'm gonna let you talk to Kenny.

01:06:56.759 --> 01:06:58.158
Hey, bro.

01:06:59.262 --> 01:07:00.593
Put her back on.

01:07:00.763 --> 01:07:02.094
Listen, I know exactly how you feel.

01:07:02.265 --> 01:07:04.699
No, Kenny, you don't know how
I'm feeling.

01:07:04.867 --> 01:07:06.801
You know why?
Because you're an asshole!

01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:09.130
You're a puppeteering
asshole freak!

01:07:09.305 --> 01:07:12.297
Well, see that school has improved
your language.

01:07:37.033 --> 01:07:39.729
We can learn much
about the spiritual life

01:07:39.902 --> 01:07:41.995
from a term used
in sound recording,

01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:43.661
called the "noise floor."

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.070
The noise floor is the amount of noise

01:07:46.242 --> 01:07:47.573
already present in an environment...

01:07:48.878 --> 01:07:52.507
that, uh, has to be overcome
before anything else can be heard.

01:07:52.682 --> 01:07:54.809
Now, this concept
is particularly important...

01:07:56.219 --> 01:07:58.915
...when it comes
to the life of the spirit.

01:07:59.088 --> 01:08:01.556
We need to find a refuge
from the often-deafening

01:08:01.724 --> 01:08:03.692
noise floor of life...

01:08:04.494 --> 01:08:06.724
to hear the still, small
voice of God.

01:08:06.896 --> 01:08:07.920
Young man, may I help you?

01:08:08.097 --> 01:08:09.997
Yeah. Got some things to return.

01:08:45.234 --> 01:08:47.759
All right. Okay, you ready?
Overhand again.

01:08:50.139 --> 01:08:52.607
Okay, bring it back overhand.

01:10:39.549 --> 01:10:41.039
Hello.

01:10:45.755 --> 01:10:47.222
Miller! Miller.

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.915
Hey, park this piece of crap.
It's about to start.

01:10:50.092 --> 01:10:51.320
I can't find a space.

01:10:51.494 --> 01:10:54.725
Ah, it's after 6:00.
I give you my blessing to park here.

01:10:56.866 --> 01:10:59.027
Yeah, right. Nice.

01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:02.660
Take the Bible. Please.

01:11:04.407 --> 01:11:06.432
It's not that the book
is contradictory.

01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:08.372
It's not a book at all.

01:11:08.544 --> 01:11:09.772
It's a collection of writings

01:11:09.946 --> 01:11:11.709
compiled over the course
of nine centuries

01:11:11.881 --> 01:11:13.781
that, when taken together,

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.249
present such a hopelessly
muddled worldview

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.547
that it's easy to see
why so many of its followers

01:11:19.722 --> 01:11:21.553
for so much of our history

01:11:21.724 --> 01:11:24.056
have killed one another
over its meanings.

01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:28.523
Many refugee families
have become subsistence farmers

01:11:28.698 --> 01:11:32.600
who live in abandoned and often
condemned houses and shacks

01:11:32.768 --> 01:11:36.363
and survive year to year by planting
whatever crops they can.

01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:40.308
Mr. Larkin has set up
the scientific method

01:11:40.476 --> 01:11:41.875
as his biblical canon,

01:11:42.044 --> 01:11:43.102
yet with that method,

01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:47.943
he still can't prove that a sunset
is more beautiful than...

01:11:48.117 --> 01:11:49.709
I don't know, camel dung.

01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:53.718
Or that music is more sensible
than noise.

01:11:53.889 --> 01:11:55.322
By his own reasoning,

01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:59.951
he is delusional to even tell
his wife and children he loves them.

01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:03.929
There's nothing delusional about
the chemical reaction we call love.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.762
It forces the species to bond together

01:12:06.936 --> 01:12:10.167
and preserve the social structure,
nothing more.

01:12:10.339 --> 01:12:12.170
The theist has a sound explanation

01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:16.334
as to why humans need more than
to just survive.

01:12:16.512 --> 01:12:18.844
We long for love and justice,

01:12:19.015 --> 01:12:21.506
beauty, transcendence,

01:12:21.684 --> 01:12:27.247
because they echo the voice calling us
to know their origin.

01:12:27.423 --> 01:12:29.482
Okay, let's take another question.

01:12:29.659 --> 01:12:31.183
Uh, Mr. Larkin,
I'm just curious...

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.419
Actually, the gentleman
right next to the hat, please.

01:12:35.531 --> 01:12:38.091
Um, Mr. Larkin,

01:12:38.267 --> 01:12:40.861
in your book, you admit to a sense
of awe and reverence

01:12:41.037 --> 01:12:42.504
when you encounter
the beauty of nature

01:12:42.672 --> 01:12:45.436
and the intricacies
of the universe.

01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:49.044
Has that ever led you to consider
that there might be a God?

01:12:49.211 --> 01:12:50.371
No.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.272
Hell, no.

01:12:53.516 --> 01:12:56.178
So then where do we find meaning?

01:12:56.352 --> 01:12:58.286
Meaning?

01:12:58.454 --> 01:13:01.355
The universe doesn't owe us
meaning, son.

01:13:01.524 --> 01:13:04.118
If you want meaning,

01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:06.727
I suggest you try a dictionary.

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.530
Yeah. Thanks.

01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:31.481
And on the last day,

01:13:31.654 --> 01:13:33.747
when I went to say goodbye
to the family,

01:13:33.923 --> 01:13:35.914
they were already waiting for me.

01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:39.528
Little Reena came up to me
with a giant smile on her face

01:13:39.695 --> 01:13:44.496
and handed me an egg
that their chicken had laid.

01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:48.501
I knew it was all they had.

01:13:50.339 --> 01:13:55.606
So when you think of Kashmir...

01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:58.542
that's the face
I'd like you to remember.

01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:05.778
Um, are there any questions?

01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:09.246
Lauryn.

01:14:10.392 --> 01:14:13.623
The amount of misery and suffering
in that part of the world

01:14:13.796 --> 01:14:15.627
seems so overwhelming.

01:14:15.798 --> 01:14:19.928
I just... I don't know
how you deal with it.

01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:21.763
Is that a question, Lauryn?

01:14:21.937 --> 01:14:23.564
I mean, I don't mean
to get personal,

01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:27.231
but I know you have
these religious beliefs,

01:14:27.409 --> 01:14:30.139
and...

01:14:30.312 --> 01:14:32.906
don't you ever wonder why God
doesn't just do something?

01:14:33.082 --> 01:14:37.143
Look, I don't mean to go
all Mother Teresa on you,

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:40.914
but she believed that the spiritual
poverty of the West

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:42.421
was far more oppressive

01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:44.491
than any physical poverty
she saw in India.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.151
All I know is that
when I was there,

01:14:47.329 --> 01:14:51.060
away from all the noise
and distraction,

01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:53.966
I never felt so close to God.

01:14:54.136 --> 01:14:55.797
I can't explain it.

01:14:55.971 --> 01:14:58.269
I just want to go back.

01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:02.843
Thank you.

01:15:16.425 --> 01:15:17.414
Don?

01:15:21.764 --> 01:15:22.662
Are you there?

01:15:23.933 --> 01:15:24.922
Don.

01:15:27.503 --> 01:15:29.937
Where were you tonight?

01:15:30.105 --> 01:15:31.697
What are you doing
with my phone?

01:15:31.874 --> 01:15:35.469
Um, I fixed it with my hair dryer.

01:15:35.644 --> 01:15:37.976
You shouldn't hang up on your mom.

01:15:41.116 --> 01:15:43.277
You didn't talk to her, did you?

01:15:44.386 --> 01:15:46.786
We chatted... briefly.

01:15:53.796 --> 01:15:55.491
She needs you, Don.

01:15:55.664 --> 01:15:57.325
Stay away from me, Penny.

01:16:00.402 --> 01:16:02.563
Don!

01:16:02.738 --> 01:16:04.467
Don, wait!

01:16:05.674 --> 01:16:07.232
Don, she made a mistake.

01:16:07.409 --> 01:16:09.001
No, dialing the wrong number
is a mistake.

01:16:09.178 --> 01:16:12.079
Having a baby with a married man,
that's being a slut.

01:16:12.248 --> 01:16:13.579
You're talking about your mother.

01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:15.717
Yeah, I think I know her
a little better than you do.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.585
What else did she tell you?

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.557
Not that much.

01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:25.820
Were you really assistant
to your youth pastor?

01:16:26.862 --> 01:16:28.352
Get the hell away from me.

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:34.828
Why are you trying
to hide who you are?

01:16:35.004 --> 01:16:36.665
'Cause I'm done with those freaks.

01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:37.863
What, like me?

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.530
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why not?

01:16:39.708 --> 01:16:42.006
Because your mom isn't having sex
with a youth pastor.

01:16:42.177 --> 01:16:44.702
No, my mom is just roaming the streets
of God knows where

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.404
having sex with JFK.

01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:51.750
- At least she's got an excuse.
- And what's my excuse?

01:16:51.921 --> 01:16:53.752
I stopped visiting her
when I was in high school

01:16:53.923 --> 01:16:56.050
because I was too ashamed.

01:16:56.225 --> 01:16:59.422
Now I have no idea
where she is.

01:16:59.595 --> 01:17:01.119
I didn't know.

01:17:01.297 --> 01:17:03.288
Yeah, there's a lot you don't
know about everybody.

01:17:03.465 --> 01:17:06.025
People are human.
People are flawed.

01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:07.691
We all have our crap.

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:09.804
I abandoned my mom.

01:17:13.475 --> 01:17:14.635
Talk to her.

01:17:22.584 --> 01:17:24.211
I want to be alone.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.552
I'm taking this.

01:17:27.723 --> 01:17:28.985
Don't look at the flame.

01:17:43.238 --> 01:17:45.672
If you start pushing people away,

01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:47.832
eventually they just leave you alone...

01:17:49.678 --> 01:17:50.906
with your thoughts,

01:17:51.814 --> 01:17:53.475
with your demons,

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:56.281
with the sound of your own breathing.

01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:00.019
But if you're going to have
an existential crisis,

01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:02.180
Portland in winter is hard to beat.

01:18:03.692 --> 01:18:05.125
The city is a shadow.

01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:10.120
The clouds are a blanket
pulled over your head.

01:18:12.701 --> 01:18:15.932
School year seems like
it's never going to end.

01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:23.167
And it's easy to avoid
the people you're trying to avoid.

01:18:26.615 --> 01:18:28.344
By the end of finals,

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:31.281
you're so burned out
on the pursuit of knowledge

01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:32.852
that any sign of life,

01:18:33.989 --> 01:18:35.456
even if it's artificial,

01:18:36.725 --> 01:18:38.556
seems worth pursuing.

01:18:49.505 --> 01:18:51.632
Hey, hey, hey. What's up?

01:18:51.807 --> 01:18:53.638
We're almost there. Lauryn!

01:18:55.244 --> 01:18:57.838
I found her barking up a tree.
I think she's dehydrated.

01:18:58.013 --> 01:18:59.173
Let's get her to a cot.

01:19:01.717 --> 01:19:03.742
Hey, Miller! Little help?

01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:07.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:11.251
Thank you for returning my e-mails.

01:19:11.427 --> 01:19:13.657
Sorry. School has been crazy.

01:19:13.829 --> 01:19:15.820
Yeah, you promised me last month
you'd help me with this.

01:19:15.998 --> 01:19:17.226
I don't do well around blood.

01:19:18.567 --> 01:19:19.727
Or that.

01:19:35.851 --> 01:19:37.341
Miller.

01:19:39.955 --> 01:19:41.388
Leaded or unleaded?

01:19:41.557 --> 01:19:42.922
Time will tell.

01:19:44.426 --> 01:19:48.055
So... your first Renn Fayre.

01:19:49.598 --> 01:19:50.758
What do you think?

01:19:50.933 --> 01:19:52.195
Snacks are good.

01:19:52.367 --> 01:19:54.460
You have no idea.

01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:03.404
You gonna miss being The Pope?

01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:04.546
You know, it's weird.

01:20:04.713 --> 01:20:07.079
Certain people see the hat coming,
and it's almost like...

01:20:07.249 --> 01:20:09.080
It's almost like it gives them hope.

01:20:12.387 --> 01:20:14.719
Go with dog, my son.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.053
If God's dead, what's the point?

01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:23.721
'Cause people need this shit,
and they always will.

01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:30.928
The people with steel balls
are the ones who never cry out to God.

01:20:32.307 --> 01:20:38.007
I mean, they've looked into the abyss,
and they know, man.

01:20:39.014 --> 01:20:40.743
There is no one coming to the rescue.

01:20:44.353 --> 01:20:45.820
How do you know that?

01:20:45.988 --> 01:20:47.979
I know what I know, Miller.

01:20:48.157 --> 01:20:51.024
That kid,
the one in the booth last year,

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:53.593
who got abused by the priest...

01:20:53.762 --> 01:20:54.990
What about him?

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:00.199
Nothing.

01:21:03.805 --> 01:21:05.796
To the great nothing.

01:21:07.843 --> 01:21:09.777
What's this?

01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:11.640
It goes with the brownies.

01:21:23.225 --> 01:21:25.386
Let's do some damage.

01:21:41.343 --> 01:21:42.503
Yeah!

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.859
The air is heavy with anticipation

01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:04.999
as the silent crowd awaits the decision.

01:22:16.411 --> 01:22:18.276
The Pope has made his selection.

01:22:18.447 --> 01:22:21.177
Prepare for the crowning
of the new Pope!

01:22:26.355 --> 01:22:29.756
Candidates, present yourselves!

01:22:29.925 --> 01:22:33.691
Huzzah! Huzzah.

01:22:35.063 --> 01:22:38.590
Ah, this is gonna get nasty.

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:43.895
The Pope considers the Russian.

01:22:47.075 --> 01:22:49.976
And the Russian has been passed over!

01:22:50.145 --> 01:22:52.409
Who shall it be?

01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:54.276
The young foppish prince?

01:22:56.652 --> 01:22:59.746
It is not to be, my friends!

01:22:59.921 --> 01:23:03.652
Will the ginger lady ragdoll
be our new Pope?

01:23:06.995 --> 01:23:10.795
She is not.
The rabbit stands alone.

01:23:10.966 --> 01:23:14.902
Prepare for the crowning
of our new Pope!

01:23:17.072 --> 01:23:18.733
No! The rabbit
has been rejected.

01:23:18.907 --> 01:23:22.070
This is unprecedented!
Who now?!

01:23:22.244 --> 01:23:25.645
Who now amongst us
shall be The Pope?

01:23:30.285 --> 01:23:33.254
The Pope considers the Texan.

01:23:33.422 --> 01:23:34.480
What madness is this?

01:23:34.656 --> 01:23:36.317
It's just a hunch, Miller.

01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:38.652
The Pope will now remove his miter.

01:23:38.827 --> 01:23:39.657
Hold your applause.

01:23:39.828 --> 01:23:42.490
His Eminence can be fickle.

01:23:42.664 --> 01:23:44.256
The Pope has been chosen!

01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:47.766
Citizens of the Reed,
we have a new Pope!

01:23:55.277 --> 01:23:57.211
Yeah!

01:23:57.379 --> 01:24:01.042
Let the christening
of the pagans commence!

01:24:09.458 --> 01:24:11.358
Prepare yourself...

01:24:11.693 --> 01:24:13.217
to kiss The Virgin.

01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:16.296
Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!

01:24:16.465 --> 01:24:21.027
Virgin! Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:23.562
Faithful subjects of Reed,

01:24:23.739 --> 01:24:26.970
greet your new Pope!

01:24:35.484 --> 01:24:36.883
The Pope is down!

01:24:37.052 --> 01:24:38.212
We have a down Pope!

01:24:42.057 --> 01:24:43.354
Oh, God.

01:24:43.525 --> 01:24:44.822
Climax.

01:24:44.993 --> 01:24:46.153
Oh, God help me.

01:24:46.328 --> 01:24:50.264
The final C in SCCR.

01:24:50.432 --> 01:24:52.024
Hello!

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.532
Hello?

01:24:54.703 --> 01:24:56.603
Somebody!

01:24:56.772 --> 01:24:59.206
I'm trapped in... in this thing!

01:25:03.278 --> 01:25:06.679
Hello! Help me!

01:25:09.117 --> 01:25:10.607
Hello?

01:25:10.786 --> 01:25:14.017
Hello. Hello. Get me out of here!

01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:15.622
Uh, hold on.

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:17.088
Hey, n-no. I'm trapped in here!

01:25:17.259 --> 01:25:18.556
Please get me out of here!

01:25:18.727 --> 01:25:20.786
Please! Please get me out!

01:25:20.962 --> 01:25:23.021
I... I think I'm gonna have to roll this.

01:25:23.198 --> 01:25:26.861
Okay. Okay, I don't care.
I don't care. Go.

01:25:27.035 --> 01:25:28.195
All right, you ready?

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:30.201
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just do it.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.470
Try again. Try...

01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:37.278
You okay?

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.911
It's okay. Just take my hand.

01:25:55.997 --> 01:25:58.329
My daddy has a dress like that.

01:26:01.136 --> 01:26:04.299
Don't forget your miter.

01:26:04.473 --> 01:26:05.599
Very good, Sophie.

01:26:30.599 --> 01:26:32.328
When dawn breaks in Echo Park

01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:35.629
near downtown Los Angeles,
the locals begin to...

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:38.432
Breaking news report.

01:26:38.607 --> 01:26:42.099
The government is calling it the deadliest
earthquake in India's history,

01:26:42.277 --> 01:26:45.212
and the devastation took
the greatest toll on Kashmir,

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.543
with local officials confirming
at least 16,000 dead,

01:26:48.717 --> 01:26:50.685
a number they fear may double,

01:26:50.852 --> 01:26:55.551
as area refugee camps face a shortage
of food, water and medical supplies.

01:27:13.408 --> 01:27:14.397
Penny.

01:27:19.548 --> 01:27:20.537
Penny?

01:27:23.585 --> 01:27:25.075
She left.

01:27:26.555 --> 01:27:27.681
Gone to India.

01:27:27.856 --> 01:27:29.153
When?

01:27:29.324 --> 01:27:32.384
Last night after the news about
the earthquake broke.

01:27:33.895 --> 01:27:35.692
Dude, she was trying
to find you.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.566
Um, I'm doing laundry,

01:27:41.736 --> 01:27:43.601
so you want to...

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.667
Yeah.

01:27:49.377 --> 01:27:51.242
I'll use the delicate cycle.

01:27:51.413 --> 01:27:52.243
Thanks.

01:27:54.883 --> 01:27:55.907
Don't look.

01:27:56.585 --> 01:27:58.712
- Don't flatter yourself.
- Shut up.

01:28:03.258 --> 01:28:04.623
No peeking.

01:28:06.695 --> 01:28:07.889
Are those owls?

01:28:09.097 --> 01:28:10.291
Penguins.

01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:12.956
Told you not to look.

01:28:13.134 --> 01:28:14.396
Sorry.

01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:32.537
Sometimes you have to watch
somebody love something...

01:29:34.282 --> 01:29:36.477
before you can love it yourself.

01:29:42.223 --> 01:29:44.555
Penny loves Jesus.

01:29:44.726 --> 01:29:46.660
My dad loves jazz.

01:29:46.828 --> 01:29:49.353
He told me jazz is like life,

01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:51.499
because it doesn't resolve.

01:29:52.534 --> 01:29:55.298
And he gave me his record
collection to prove it.

01:30:00.075 --> 01:30:04.341
But I've been listening
to those records over and over,

01:30:04.512 --> 01:30:07.310
and every time I put on
Coltrane's A Love Supreme,

01:30:07.482 --> 01:30:12.419
I could swear I hear something
my father says isn't there.

01:30:12.587 --> 01:30:14.077
I hear a resolution.

01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:18.417
Resolution,

01:30:18.593 --> 01:30:21.562
the final element in story.

01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:24.995
I know not everybody hears
the universe this way,

01:30:25.166 --> 01:30:26.895
but what if Penny's right?

01:30:27.068 --> 01:30:32.700
What if God is trying
to compose something?

01:30:32.874 --> 01:30:37.277
What if all these stars
are notes on a page of music,

01:30:37.445 --> 01:30:40.243
swirling in the blue like jazz?

01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:02.928
Hey, Mom.

01:31:03.104 --> 01:31:05.766
Don, is that you?

01:31:06.808 --> 01:31:10.209
I'm glad you called, Mom.
How are you?

01:31:10.779 --> 01:31:14.613
Some of you have come
a long way to get here,

01:31:14.783 --> 01:31:18.583
and I'm talking about
a geography of the heart.

01:31:18.753 --> 01:31:23.554
But what you're looking for
is bigger than any church,

01:31:23.725 --> 01:31:26.125
so this is the time in the service

01:31:26.294 --> 01:31:28.455
when we get out of the way

01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:31.292
so that you can speak to God directly...

01:31:32.901 --> 01:31:36.166
and hopefully hear God speak to you.

01:31:48.983 --> 01:31:50.951
Thought you were in Kashmir.

01:31:51.119 --> 01:31:53.087
I got as far as Los Angeles,

01:31:53.254 --> 01:31:55.984
and the embassy
stopped issuing visas.

01:31:58.326 --> 01:32:00.817
Did you ever call your mom?

01:32:01.996 --> 01:32:03.156
She said to give you a hug.

01:32:03.331 --> 01:32:04.923
Amen.

01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:10.502
The peace of the Lord
be always with you.

01:32:10.672 --> 01:32:13.300
And also with you.

01:32:57.652 --> 01:33:00.485
Right this way, Your Eminence.

01:33:04.058 --> 01:33:07.050
Well, you look reasonably sober.

01:33:07.228 --> 01:33:08.593
Yeah, you know.

01:33:08.763 --> 01:33:10.094
Try it on.

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.508
Sweet.

01:33:21.676 --> 01:33:23.268
All right, sit down.

01:33:23.444 --> 01:33:26.038
And according to tradition,

01:33:26.214 --> 01:33:27.681
I am to be your first confession,

01:33:27.849 --> 01:33:30.079
so let's see.

01:33:31.552 --> 01:33:34.350
Oh, I stole a condom
out of The Virgin's wallet.

01:33:34.522 --> 01:33:36.080
Last night while he was passed out.

01:33:36.257 --> 01:33:39.192
I figured he wasn't really
gonna be using it, so...

01:33:40.728 --> 01:33:43.754
This is the part
where I say you're forgiven?

01:33:43.932 --> 01:33:47.060
Uh-huh. Are you sure
you're up for this?

01:33:47.235 --> 01:33:48.224
It's hard shoes to fill.

01:33:48.403 --> 01:33:49.392
You were a well-loved Pope.

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.936
Ah. Kiss-ass.

01:33:52.106 --> 01:33:56.042
Well, I'm going to leave you
to your flock.

01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:58.644
Some of us are heading out
to the Grand Canyon in the morning

01:33:58.813 --> 01:34:00.440
for a little, uh, summer trip,

01:34:00.615 --> 01:34:03.106
so, um, I won't be seeing you.

01:34:03.284 --> 01:34:06.378
Have a good time.
Congrats on graduating.

01:34:06.554 --> 01:34:08.454
Yeah, well,

01:34:08.623 --> 01:34:11.751
nine years well spent.

01:34:13.561 --> 01:34:14.550
Hey.

01:34:15.663 --> 01:34:18.826
Um, I forgot to ask you something.

01:34:19.968 --> 01:34:23.301
Can you come back in just a minute?

01:34:34.615 --> 01:34:37.015
I need to say...

01:34:37.185 --> 01:34:38.743
I'm sorry.

01:34:40.688 --> 01:34:42.019
Sorry for what?

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:47.086
I'm sorry for what might have
happened to you

01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:49.855
when you were younger.

01:34:50.431 --> 01:34:51.830
The priest.

01:34:53.601 --> 01:34:55.159
I don't know.

01:34:55.336 --> 01:34:56.928
I'm just sorry.

01:34:59.307 --> 01:35:01.605
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:35:01.776 --> 01:35:04.267
Can... Can you just sit back down?

01:35:19.961 --> 01:35:22.623
There's a lot you don't know about me.

01:35:25.233 --> 01:35:28.498
I come out of this subculture

01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:32.298
that believes in God

01:35:32.473 --> 01:35:34.498
and Jesus, the whole deal.

01:35:34.675 --> 01:35:37.803
I came here to escape it,

01:35:37.979 --> 01:35:39.970
because I was ashamed of it.

01:35:41.482 --> 01:35:45.179
Well, you've done a hell of a job.
I'm very proud of you.

01:35:46.687 --> 01:35:50.487
But it turns out that
I'm not just ashamed

01:35:50.658 --> 01:35:53.388
of my strange church

01:35:53.561 --> 01:35:56.655
or its political views

01:35:56.831 --> 01:35:58.924
or all the hypocrites.

01:36:03.504 --> 01:36:05.495
I'm ashamed of Jesus.

01:36:08.009 --> 01:36:09.499
Is this gonna get weird?

01:36:09.677 --> 01:36:11.076
Yeah, probably.

01:36:13.114 --> 01:36:15.082
But that's the point.

01:36:15.249 --> 01:36:20.619
I-I'm ashamed of Jesus
because I want you to like me.

01:36:20.788 --> 01:36:23.188
I want you to think I'm smart

01:36:23.357 --> 01:36:26.849
or sophisticated or whatever.

01:36:27.028 --> 01:36:33.263
It's like Jesus is the geek
in the cafeteria sitting by himself,

01:36:33.434 --> 01:36:36.528
and I'm the guy pretending
he's not my friend.

01:36:37.371 --> 01:36:39.464
Miller, we're both tired.

01:36:40.241 --> 01:36:42.402
You're The Pope now.
Do with it what you want.

01:36:42.577 --> 01:36:43.771
That's not what I'm saying.

01:36:43.945 --> 01:36:46.971
I'm talking to you as a person.

01:36:51.319 --> 01:36:52.809
You and I both hate

01:36:52.987 --> 01:36:54.648
those people who think they can do
whatever they want

01:36:54.822 --> 01:36:56.380
because God is on their side, right?

01:36:57.825 --> 01:36:58.917
Well, I'm apologizing,

01:36:59.093 --> 01:37:03.553
because I'm the same as they are.

01:37:04.632 --> 01:37:06.930
All that stuff in the Bible

01:37:07.101 --> 01:37:08.568
about feeding the poor,

01:37:08.736 --> 01:37:10.727
I've never done any of that.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.970
God tells us to love everybody.

01:37:15.143 --> 01:37:17.111
I've hated people...

01:37:17.278 --> 01:37:19.678
my family,

01:37:19.847 --> 01:37:22.782
folks back home I don't agree with,

01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:24.611
idiot pastors.

01:37:24.785 --> 01:37:27.754
I... I hated 'em

01:37:27.922 --> 01:37:31.255
because I thought they made me
look like a fool.

01:37:32.994 --> 01:37:39.092
I've spent the school year
trying to ditch God.

01:37:41.702 --> 01:37:43.169
But I can't.

01:37:45.039 --> 01:37:47.837
It's like He's following me around.

01:37:50.378 --> 01:37:52.676
I'm confessing to you

01:37:52.847 --> 01:37:55.782
that I'm tired of being a hypocrite

01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:57.975
and a coward.

01:38:00.821 --> 01:38:02.379
I need you to forgive me.

01:38:06.827 --> 01:38:08.226
Do you forgive me?

01:38:10.631 --> 01:38:13.122
I wouldn't know what
to forgive you for.

01:38:13.301 --> 01:38:16.896
Do you forgive me
for misrepresenting God?

01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:19.130
He isn't like me.

01:38:19.307 --> 01:38:21.639
He isn't... He isn't afraid,

01:38:21.809 --> 01:38:24.505
and He isn't a coward,
and He isn't a hypocrite,

01:38:24.679 --> 01:38:26.237
and He isn't like
that messed-up priest

01:38:26.414 --> 01:38:28.405
who raped you
when you were a kid.

01:38:29.917 --> 01:38:32.477
I should have told you that
a long time ago.

01:38:33.521 --> 01:38:35.580
Will you forgive me?

01:39:03.251 --> 01:39:04.582
Yeah.

01:39:08.789 --> 01:39:10.416
I forgive you.

01:39:21.936 --> 01:39:24.097
It's good, Miller,

01:39:24.272 --> 01:39:26.365
what you're doing.

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.132
It's a start.

01:39:28.309 --> 01:39:30.209
You know, if everybody
out there in that line

01:39:30.378 --> 01:39:31.367
gets the same treatment I did,

01:39:31.545 --> 01:39:33.570
you are in for a long night.

01:39:33.748 --> 01:39:36.774
Yeah, well,
so much to apologize for.

01:39:36.951 --> 01:39:39.044
Maybe I'll start with the Crusades...

01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:40.448
Yeah.

01:39:40.621 --> 01:39:42.816
Then work my way through
to U.S. foreign policy.

01:39:43.724 --> 01:39:44.713
Yeah.

01:39:44.892 --> 01:39:46.883
You're gonna be here a while.

01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:58.402
You really believe in all this stuff?

01:40:01.309 --> 01:40:03.243
I think...

01:40:06.113 --> 01:40:07.444
I do.

01:40:18.959 --> 01:40:20.426
Then...

01:40:24.498 --> 01:40:26.159
Dominus vobiscum.

01:40:31.872 --> 01:40:32.861
My man.

01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:46.051
Hey, guys, you are not
gonna want to miss this.

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.881
Come on, come on.
I'm sure that we got

01:40:48.055 --> 01:40:49.317
a free space in line for you.

01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:50.684
Hey, what's up?

01:40:50.858 --> 01:40:52.348
Everybody in line,
saints and sinners.

01:40:52.526 --> 01:40:54.858
Hey, hey, there's a line, man.

01:41:07.908 --> 01:41:11.241
I have something to confess.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.905
- Your, uh...
- Wait.

01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:18.079
I'm going first.
