01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.107
Everything I did was
to protect you from him.

01:10:40.109 --> 01:10:42.609
And from that,
and from knowing that.

01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:43.980

01:11:03.999 --> 01:11:06.000
[Joan] I was just...

01:11:06.002 --> 01:11:08.669
- Reacting?
- Something like that.

I don't even know what I...
what I... what I did.

01:11:44.073 --> 01:11:45.305
Stop.

01:11:45.307 --> 01:11:46.642
He came towards me...

01:11:47.644 --> 01:11:49.480
- Mom.
- Please.

01:11:51.314 --> 01:11:53.313
[gasping, whimpering]

01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:54.916
Don't.

01:11:54.918 --> 01:11:57.718
Stop! [whimpering]

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.554
Robert! Stop! Stop!

01:11:59.556 --> 01:12:02.826
You don't have to do whatever
you're thinking of doing!

01:12:06.162 --> 01:12:07.798
[gasping]

01:12:14.102 --> 01:12:16.970
And he said, "First you..."

01:12:16.972 --> 01:12:20.041
- [Lissa] No.
- "...then Lissa, then me."

01:12:20.043 --> 01:12:23.146
No. He would never say that.

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:26.913
[gasping]

01:12:26.915 --> 01:12:28.651

01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:34.957
There are things
I'm not gonna tell you.

01:12:36.693 --> 01:12:38.628
There are parts of this
you're never gonna know.

01:12:40.329 --> 01:12:41.996
[sighs]

01:12:41.998 --> 01:12:43.229
[gasping] Robert.

01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.101
[coughing]

01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.849
I told him I was leaving him.

01:13:01.016 --> 01:13:03.149
And that I was
taking you with me.

01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:06.120
And that we couldn't
live like this.

01:13:06.122 --> 01:13:07.324
And he...

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.604

[Robert sobbing] Don't...

01:13:42.057 --> 01:13:43.760
Don't tell her.

[door slams]

01:13:52.935 --> 01:13:56.937
And I went looking for you,
and I looked all over.

01:13:56.939 --> 01:13:59.240
I went to school,
and you weren't there.

01:13:59.242 --> 01:14:01.908
I went over to Daniel's parents'
house, you weren't there.

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:03.911
I went to Aimee's house,
I looked all over,

01:14:03.913 --> 01:14:06.913
and then I came home
and you were there.

01:14:06.915 --> 01:14:08.749
With him.

01:14:08.751 --> 01:14:10.721
He was so calm.

01:14:12.754 --> 01:14:14.824
He made me a sandwich.

01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:20.096
And he said,
"Everything's gonna be fine."

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:24.331
[Joan] I know.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:27.100
What I really thought
is that everything was okay

01:14:27.102 --> 01:14:28.803
and that it was over.

01:14:28.805 --> 01:14:30.307
And then he left.

01:14:32.307 --> 01:14:34.908
And that's the last time...

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.411
He did come back.
He came back later that night

01:14:37.413 --> 01:14:41.182
and he got into bed with me and
I was too tired to say anything

01:14:41.184 --> 01:14:42.849
or to do anything.

01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:45.421
And then the next morning,
he was gone.

01:14:47.222 --> 01:14:49.889
There's nothing you could
have done, you know that, right?

01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:53.029
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- Listen to me.

01:14:54.963 --> 01:14:58.465
There is nothing
you could have done.

01:14:58.467 --> 01:15:00.870
I miss him a lot.

01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:08.845
Despite everything that happened,
I miss him all the time.

[woman] I never thought
you can love a human being

01:15:15.318 --> 01:15:17.785
as much as you love your kids.

01:15:17.787 --> 01:15:20.757
And you'll do anything
for them, anything.

01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:23.994
[sighing]

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:30.865
The best part of the day is
whenever my kids smile at me

01:15:30.867 --> 01:15:32.899
or they give me a hug
and say, "I love you, Mommy."

01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:35.169
My kids are my best friends.
They are.

01:15:35.171 --> 01:15:38.938
They are my world.
They're funny.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.876
[giggles] You know,
I just love 'em, I love 'em.

01:15:41.878 --> 01:15:44.844
No matter what they do,

01:15:44.846 --> 01:15:50.184
that you will, as a mother,
love them unconditionally.

01:15:50.186 --> 01:15:54.921
They're the reason that I've
chosen to go on with life,

01:15:54.923 --> 01:15:57.258

01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:01.127

that you need to do

01:16:24.153 --> 01:16:26.487
would be okay...

01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:31.394
It can still be okay.

01:16:33.596 --> 01:16:36.095
Well, we have to find out
whether, um...

01:16:36.097 --> 01:16:37.767
Either way.

You're not alone.

I remember understanding.

I knew it wasn't my time.

01:18:22.003 --> 01:18:23.606
