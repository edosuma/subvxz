WEBVTT

00:03.130 --> 00:04.768
- You're quite the topic
of conversation

00:04.800 --> 00:08.133
in the psychiatric circles.
The reason you failed to
capture the Chesapeake Ripper

00:08.170 --> 00:10.604
is I already had him.
- I did it.

00:10.640 --> 00:14.030
- Miriam Lass is dead.
The Chesapeake Ripper is making
it very clear that someone is

00:14.080 --> 00:16.742
plagiarizing his work.
- Is it possible you

00:16.780 --> 00:20.443
inadvertently planted
the suggestion in Gideon's mind

00:20.480 --> 00:22.687
that he was the Ripper?
- Psychic driving is unethical.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.315
- I have feelings for you.
I can't just have an affair.
- Why?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.750
- I think you're unstable.
- You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the bureau.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.793
Jack pushed you right up
to the edge and now you're
pushing yourself over.

00:32.830 --> 00:36.288
- (Jack): What happened
in there? I saw the look
on your face.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.697
- You must overcome
these delusions that_are
dingIsmg your reality.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.334
- It's anti-NMDA receptor
encephalitis.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.737
- Now that we have confirmed
what it is, it'll be easier
to hide from him.

00:49.180 --> 00:52.274
Someone who already doubts
their own identity

00:52.320 --> 00:54.515
can be more susceptible
to manipulation.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.780
Dr. Gideon is a psychopath.

00:56.820 --> 01:00.256
Psychopaths are narcissists.
They rarely doubt who they are.

01:00.290 --> 01:03.782
- I tried to appeal
to his narcissism.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.697
- By convincing him
he was the Chesapeake Ripper.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.521
- If only I had been
more curious

01:11.570 --> 01:14.095
about the common mind.
- I have

01:14.140 --> 01:18.429
no interest in understanding
sheep; only eating them.

01:18.470 --> 01:23.203
Kudal. A South Indian curry.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.548
Made from sheep, of course.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.617
In a coconut-coriander-
chIII sauce.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.850
- It feels like a last supper.

01:33.890 --> 01:37.849
- You're not the only
psychiatrist accused by
a patient of making them kill.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.791
Poke around a psychopath's mind,

01:40.830 --> 01:44.322
bound to get poked back.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.558
- What would you do
in my position?

01:48.600 --> 01:51.535
- Deny everything.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.600
- I thought psychic driving
would have been more effective
in breaking down

01:56.650 --> 02:00.177
his personality.
- Psychic driving fails
because its methods are

02:00.220 --> 02:04.384
too obvious. You were trying
too hard, Frederick.
If force is used,

02:04.420 --> 02:07.856
the subject will only surrender
temporarily. Once a patient is
exposed

02:07.890 --> 02:10.927
to the method of manipulation,
it becomes much less effective.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.394
- When Dr. Gideon began

02:13.430 --> 02:16.820
to suspect he was being pushed--
- He pushed back.

02:16.870 --> 02:20.260
The subject mustn't be aware
of any influence.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.302
(insects chirping)

03:13.990 --> 03:17.585
(breathing rapidly)

03:48.560 --> 03:50.619
(startled shouting)

03:53.600 --> 03:55.750
(catching his breath)

04:06.340 --> 04:09.468
- So, you get to dress up
and I don't?

04:09.510 --> 04:11.478
This might affect how well

04:11.510 --> 04:13.717
my testimony goes over
with the judge.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.947
- Testimony speaks for itself.
- Frederick, don't look
so worried.

04:16.990 --> 04:20.312
I forgive you your trespasses.
- What trespasses are those?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.521
- You made me
kill the nurse.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.427
I take responsibility for
killing my wife and her family.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.451
The nurse is your fault.
- I cannot

04:27.500 --> 04:29.718
accept responsibility
for your actions, Abel.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.864
- Au contraire.
It's why I'm suing you.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.869
You made me think I was
somebody else,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.868
and now...

04:37.910 --> 04:40.674
who knows what I'm thinking?
- Dr. Gideon,

04:40.710 --> 04:44.703
you told me you were
the Chesapeake Ripper.
- Dr. Chilton, you told

04:44.750 --> 04:50.848
me I was the Chesapeake Ripper,
and that's what I'm going
to tell everyone.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.484
- See you in court.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.372
- You married?

05:20.880 --> 05:22.882
You married?

05:24.890 --> 05:26.858
You're married.

05:26.890 --> 05:29.984
How long you married?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.759
That long?

05:34.160 --> 05:38.859
Regarding divorce--
not that you're getting one;

05:38.900 --> 05:44.008
just I can see the clock
in your eyes--

05:44.040 --> 05:46.008
word of advice:

05:46.040 --> 05:49.601
it's easier just
to kill 'em.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.868
Kill 'em, kill everyone
at the table.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.946
Less paperwork.

05:53.980 --> 05:57.586
Worked for me.
I'm doing OK.

05:57.620 --> 06:01.078
Your wife is
probably fantastic.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.021
My wife? Horrible.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.449
So maybe I'm not supposed
to be in a relationship.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.899
There's people like that.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.699
How do you keep those whites
so clean? That's...

06:13.740 --> 06:15.594
Always amazes me.

06:30.450 --> 06:33.749
***

07:10.530 --> 07:14.125
(soft ambient pulse)

08:05.780 --> 08:09.238
- All I need is one hand free.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.139
(neck snapping)

08:36.910 --> 08:39.242
(man yelling)

08:43.350 --> 08:46.558
(Will breathing rapidly)

09:04.070 --> 09:06.038
- So, does Abel Gideon
still believe that he's

09:06.070 --> 09:08.038
the Chesapeake Ripper?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.173
- Abel Gideon is having

09:10.210 --> 09:12.849
a difference of opinion
about who he is.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.265
The man who escaped

09:34.300 --> 09:37.599
from that van was not
in the same state of mind

09:37.640 --> 09:40.200
when he did this.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.606
- He took a uniform,
police radio,

09:42.650 --> 09:45.869
two 9mm handguns, pepper spray,
Taser, and handcuffs.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.276
- Well, it's what
he didn't take.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.878
- (Bev): He hung the organs

09:49.920 --> 09:51.888
from the branch with vein
from the victims.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.888
- He even tied little bows
with some of them.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.888
- Yeah, it's really impressive.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.253
- The Chesapeake Ripper would
not have left the organs behind.

09:59.290 --> 10:03.090
- Well, if Gideon isn't
the Chesapeake Ripper,

10:03.130 --> 10:04.995
he's certainly trying
to get his attention.

10:05.030 --> 10:07.828
- Local PD picked up
a foot trail leading

10:07.870 --> 10:10.065
out of the woods. Boot soles are
consistent with the ones

10:10.110 --> 10:12.066
we found at the crime scene.
- How fresh are the tracks?

10:12.110 --> 10:14.829
- Two, three hours old.
- Which direction they headed?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.939
- Back to Baltimore.

10:16.980 --> 10:19.073
(Jack sighs.)

10:22.820 --> 10:24.811
(door opening)

10:24.850 --> 10:27.387
- I suppose this is
my fault too?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.388
- You did dodge a bullet.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.990
Gideon's escape foregoes a trial

10:35.030 --> 10:38.067
and a very public humiliation
for you.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.762
- And now you are hosting
a private one.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.768
Next you'll be accusing me

10:42.810 --> 10:45.028
of arranging his escape.
- No one's making

10:45.070 --> 10:47.334
that accusation.
- If we're tossmg around

10:47.380 --> 10:49.974
the blame, Dr. Bloom,
you're due your fair share.

10:50.010 --> 10:53.377
You planted the idea that I was
unethically manipulating Gideon.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.376
- Well, according to Gideon,
you were.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.685
- After you told him I was.
You thought I was manipulating

10:58.720 --> 11:01.154
him? He was manipulating you.

11:01.190 --> 11:04.421
- You were pushing him.
- He gave me informed
consent to treat him,

11:04.460 --> 11:09.124
said that he was grateful
for my help

11:09.160 --> 11:11.822
in understanding who he is.
- What did you help him

11:11.870 --> 11:15.169
understand?
- He was not Insane

11:15.200 --> 11:17.930
when he killed his wife;
killing her drove him insane.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.734
I did not convince him
that he was a serial killer;

11:20.780 --> 11:22.975
I just reminded him of the fact.

11:23.010 --> 11:25.376
- Gideon is not
the Chesapeake Ripper,

11:25.410 --> 11:28.846
although he might have thought
he was under your care, Doctor.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.087
- Whether he is or he isn't
doesn't really matter

11:31.120 --> 11:34.009
right now. If he thinks he is
or even if he's confused

11:34.060 --> 11:37.029
on that issue,
he will kill again.
- I hope he does not,

11:37.060 --> 11:39.483
I mean for your sake.
Cannot imagine

11:39.530 --> 11:42.499
how you would sleep
with that on your shoulders.

11:42.530 --> 11:46.830
(Chilton's voice distant)
During those three minutes,
Gideon did horrible things.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.963
- How did you sleep
when Gideon killed your nurse?

11:50.940 --> 11:52.931
- What does Gideon want?

11:52.980 --> 11:55.778
- The last thing Abel Gideon
said to me is that he intends

11:55.810 --> 11:59.439
to tell everyone that he is
the Chesapeake Ripper.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.948
- Our fugitive is Abel Gideon.
Transplant surgeon.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.412
Convicted in the first degree

12:07.460 --> 12:10.452
in the murders of his wife
and her family.

12:10.490 --> 12:14.324
Institutionalized at the
Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.828
where he killed a nurse
and claimed to be

12:16.870 --> 12:18.826
the Chesapeake Ripper.
(Jack's voice becoming distant)

12:18.870 --> 12:21.839
Dr. Gideon escaped this morning
after killing three people.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.964
He is armed and dangerous. He is
believed to be...

12:25.010 --> 12:27.069
(Jack's voice echoing)
...in the first degree

12:27.110 --> 12:31.103
in the murders of his wife and
her family. Institutionalized

12:31.150 --> 12:36.941
at the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.343
Insane.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.018
(Jack's voice distant)
...escaped this morning.

12:41.060 --> 12:45.224
He is armed, he is dangerous...
You escaped this morning.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.194
He escaped this morning.
He is armed and he is

12:47.230 --> 12:49.960
extremely dangerous.
You escaped this morning.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.436
Institutionalized
at the Baltimore State...
(cacophony of Jack's vorce)

12:53.470 --> 12:56.962
What kind of crazy are you?!

12:57.010 --> 13:01.071
You kill! You will kill again!
(Jack's voice echoing)

13:14.620 --> 13:16.554
(Jack speaking indistinctly)

13:16.590 --> 13:19.957
(people murmuring quietly)

13:29.270 --> 13:32.034
- (Lecter): What did you see?

13:32.070 --> 13:34.072
- A thicket of antlers.

13:36.910 --> 13:40.016
All I heard was my heart,

13:40.050 --> 13:44.214
dim but... but fast,

13:44.250 --> 13:47.549
like, um... footsteps

13:47.590 --> 13:49.581
fleeing into silence.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.319
I don't know how to gauge
who I am anymore.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.328
gradually becoming different
for a while.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.533
I just feel like somebody else.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.946
- What do you feel like?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.373
- I feel crazy.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.389
(Will breathing shakily)

14:18.420 --> 14:20.888
- And that is
what you fear most.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.887
- I fear not knowing who I am.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.897
That's what Abel Gideon's
afraid of, isn't it?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.564
He's like a blind man.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.104
Somebody got inside his head
and...

14:45.150 --> 14:48.608
moved all the furniture around.

14:48.650 --> 14:51.244
- I imagine Abel Gideon would
want to find

14:51.290 --> 14:54.509
the Chesapeake Ripper
to gauge who he is.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.687
And who he isn't.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.927
Will.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.925
You have me as your gauge.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.138
- Gideon didn't leave

15:14.180 --> 15:16.535
a manifesto. We confiscated
all correspondence

15:16.580 --> 15:19.549
from his outside admire_rs. We're
gomg through everything now.
- Good.

15:19.580 --> 15:23.311
- Any secret communiqus
or coded messages written
in bodily fluids

15:23.350 --> 15:25.545
or anything else,
we'll find them.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.285
- You won't find anything.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.117
Whatever's going on

15:29.160 --> 15:30.559
with Gideon, it's in his head.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.956
- Well, there's not much left
in these heads.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.652
All organ removal was done
postmortem, including the
transorbital lobotomies.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.294
- It wasn't technically
a lobotomy.

15:39.330 --> 15:42.265
He didn't remove
any of the brain;
he just scrambled them.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.303
Went in through the top
of the eye socket...

16:00.320 --> 16:03.221
- (Jack): OK, OK.
Tell me something.

16:03.260 --> 16:06.525
Why remove
all of the other organs

16:06.560 --> 16:09.358
from the bodies
and leave them intact

16:09.400 --> 16:11.322
and just scramble the brains?

16:11.370 --> 16:14.430
- That's what they did to him.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.461
- That's what who did to him?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.469
- Dr. Chilton, every
psychiatrist and PhD candidate

16:19.510 --> 16:21.478
who attempted any kind
of therapy,

16:21.510 --> 16:23.444
pushed and prodded,
gave him tests, told him

16:23.480 --> 16:25.072
who he was, who he wasn't.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.476
- All right. I want a list
of every therapist,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.318
every doctor, any kind
of psychiatric professional

16:30.350 --> 16:32.716
that worked with or talked to
Dr. Gideon.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.052
- Alana Bloom will be
on that list.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.288
- Are you my protective custody?

16:46.330 --> 16:48.161
- You heard?

16:48.200 --> 16:51.704
- I heard I get an armed escort
until Gideon's apprehended.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.708
- You'll have a real FBI agent,

16:53.740 --> 16:56.379
_ not a teacher
With a temporary badge.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.675
- Too bad. Would have been fun

16:59.710 --> 17:02.713
to cozy up with your dogs
in front of a space heater.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.686
- You don't need protective
custody to cozy up with my dogs.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.658
Or me, for that matter.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.220
Just need a little more, um...

17:16.260 --> 17:19.423
stability on my part.

17:26.710 --> 17:30.305
- You're really warm.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.341
- Yeah, I tend to run hot.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.547
They say stress raises
body temperature.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.514
- Maybe you should take
an aspirin.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.529
- Way ahead of you.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.348
- They're gonna kill Gideon,
aren't they?

17:52.370 --> 17:56.295
- Whatever happens to him has
nothing to do

17:56.340 --> 17:58.205
with you.
- Gideon can't be

17:58.240 --> 18:00.276
completely responsible
for his actions

18:00.310 --> 18:03.438
if he was subjected
to an outside influence.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.778
- What, like Chilton telling him
he's the Chesapeake Ripper?

18:05.810 --> 18:09.268
- Like me

18:09.320 --> 18:12.346
telling him he's not
in a state of mind
to know who he is.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.682
- Well, he's gonna want somebody
to tell him who he is,
and I think he'll be

18:17.730 --> 18:20.654
looking for the Ripper
to do that.

18:23.930 --> 18:27.468
- What do you think will
happen if Gideon finds
the Chesapeake Ripper?

18:29.470 --> 18:31.609
- The Chesapeake Ripper will
kill him.

18:33.610 --> 18:36.431
He took credit
for his work.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.143
The Ripper would
consider that rude.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.415
(cell phone ringtone)

18:54.360 --> 18:56.590
- Freddie Lounds.

18:56.630 --> 18:59.622
- Gideon: [My name is Paul
Carruthers. I'm a psychiatrist.]

18:59.670 --> 19:01.934
[I read your article
on Abel Gideon.]

19:01.970 --> 19:04.461
- And I yours, Dr. Carruthers.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.466
- [So you're aware of my work?]

19:06.510 --> 19:08.478
- I found your paper

19:08.510 --> 19:11.479
on narcissistic _
personality disorder in5ightful,

19:11.510 --> 19:14.616
Especially as it pertains
to your opinions of Abel Gideon.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.813
- [Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you.]

19:17.850 --> 19:19.818
- You're calling
about his escape?

19:19.850 --> 19:22.956
- [Well, yes. I'd like
to collaborate]

19:22.990 --> 19:26.289
[on an article for the Journal
of Abnormal Psychology.]

19:26.330 --> 19:28.594
- You want a writing partner?

19:28.630 --> 19:30.621
- [Could we meet?]

19:52.020 --> 19:53.749
- Hello?

19:55.890 --> 19:58.222
Dr. Carruthers?

19:58.260 --> 20:01.752
- Ms. Lounds, come on in.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.863
Now, you wrote
in your Tattler archive

20:08.900 --> 20:11.004
that the Chesapeake Ripper
once removed a man's tongue

20:11.040 --> 20:13.634
and used it as a bookmark
for his Bible.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.899
They call this
a Colombian necktie.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.514
What do you think?

20:22.520 --> 20:23.919
Ee...

20:33.030 --> 20:36.693
- Dr. Paul Carruthers wrote
an article for the Journal
of Criminal Psychology

20:36.730 --> 20:38.789
in which he described Dr. Gideon
as being

20:38.830 --> 20:41.936
a pathological narcissist who
suffers from psychotic episodes.

20:41.970 --> 20:45.599
- Let's hope he got some
satisfaction from being
proved right.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.973
- I think this is
about more than just
getting the Chesapeake

20:49.010 --> 20:50.978
Ripper's attention.
- Gideon's mind was

20:51.010 --> 20:53.001
dissected by psychiatrists

20:53.050 --> 20:57.384
and, as a surgeon, he is
applying his own skill set.

20:57.420 --> 21:01.959
He gave you something better
to do with your tongue
than wag it.

21:01.990 --> 21:04.356
- No, that's not how he died.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.029
Drained him
till his heart stopped.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.324
- Got a little on his collar.
Other than that,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.920
didn't spill a drop.
- That's because it's all

21:11.970 --> 21:14.268
in here. Four-and-a-half liters
all packed in ice.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.361
"Please deliver
to the Red Cross."

21:19.410 --> 21:22.402
- (Bev): That's considerate.
- He's peacocking
for the Ripper.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.603
- This is like flowers and
chocolate before a first date.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.523
- How is this news already?

21:43.570 --> 21:47.461
- Somebody from the Baltimore PD
must've taken a picture with
their phone and sold it

21:47.500 --> 21:49.764
to TattleCrime.
- The photo was taken

21:49.800 --> 21:52.598
before the blood was put on ice.
Dr. Gideon was still here.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.974
- He has Freddie Lounds.

21:57.010 --> 22:00.070
- You might be working out
the emergency exits,

22:00.110 --> 22:02.510
or at_ least
con5idering them.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.780
Let me just tell you
there are three.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.711
They're all terribly
locked down.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.457
Now, this relationship
between you and me,

22:12.490 --> 22:14.958
this can do us both
some good.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.127
-_I could write
a big story on you,

22:17.160 --> 22:19.799
anything you want
to say.

22:19.830 --> 22:25.439
- I did enjoy the article
you wrote about that poor nurse

22:25.470 --> 22:27.438
who I killed,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.449
but it didn't really seem
like genuine Freddie Lounds.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.574
- Jack Crawford
told me to write it.
- Of course he did.

22:33.620 --> 22:38.444
- To flush out
the Chesapeake Ripper.
- And flushed out he was.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.857
That's why he waved
Jack Crawford's

22:41.890 --> 22:43.858
dead trainee's arm
around his head

22:43.890 --> 22:47.519
right here like a flag
in this very room.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.051
- Aren't you
the Chesapeake Ripper?

22:52.070 --> 22:56.996
- Miss Lounds, I might be
slightly fuzzy in this area, but
there's no need to patronize me.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.964
- I'm sorry.

23:03.010 --> 23:07.106
- It's like remembering
something from your childhood,

23:07.150 --> 23:09.710
and you're not sure

23:09.750 --> 23:13.459
if it's your memory,
or a friend's memory,

23:13.490 --> 23:18.029
and then you realize sadly it's
just some photo in an old book.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.128
- You're waiting

23:23.160 --> 23:25.822
for the Chesapeake Ripper
to come back here.

23:25.870 --> 23:29.988
- Let's hope
he gets the invitation.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.430
There's one thing we know
about your writing:

23:33.480 --> 23:36.131
he is an avid fan.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.186
- Dr. Carson Nahn.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.994
He's the psychiatric attending
at Western General.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.498
He interviewed Dr. Gideon

23:58.530 --> 24:00.896
for the same psychopathy survey
I participated in

24:00.940 --> 24:04.239
two years ago.
- Total frenectomy,
webbing under the tongue;

24:04.270 --> 24:08.104
even the connective tissue
all the way into the throat
is cut free and pulled through

24:08.140 --> 24:10.870
for the, uh, desired effect.

24:10.910 --> 24:12.468
(Jack sighs.)

24:12.510 --> 24:14.478
- Still no word
from Dr. Chilton?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.715
- He hasn't answered his phone
since yesterday,

24:16.750 --> 24:18.479
didn't show up to work today.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.659
- Gideon wants
to lure the Ripper.

24:20.690 --> 24:24.182
He's going to offer up the man
who disrespected both
their identities.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.529
- Every detail
of Dr. Carruthers' murder

24:27.560 --> 24:30.154
as described meticulously
in Freddie Lounds' article

24:30.200 --> 24:33.192
has been faithfully
reproduced except...

24:33.230 --> 24:35.494
for one.

24:35.540 --> 24:40.068
- What's different about Carson?
Why amputate his arm?

24:40.110 --> 24:42.704
- (Jack): Did Freddie write
anything about this?

24:42.740 --> 24:44.844
- (Brian): Not that I know of,
no.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.098
- Abel Gideon didn't kill
this man;

24:47.150 --> 24:49.243
the Chesapeake Ripper did.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.589
- You said
the Chesapeake Ripper

24:51.620 --> 24:55.989
would want to kill Gideon
for taking credit for his work.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.250
- Gideon isn't alone anymore,

24:58.290 --> 25:02.226
and the Ripper isn't going
to risk exposure,

25:02.260 --> 25:05.889
so, no, he's...
he's, um...

25:05.930 --> 25:09.661
he's telling us
where to catch him.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.008
Actually, he's telling you.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.531
- Me?

25:16.580 --> 25:19.105
- Where's the last place
you saw a severed arm, Jack?

25:28.060 --> 25:30.984
- With experience, I have found

25:31.030 --> 25:33.749
surgeries are best performed
on a local anesthetic

25:33.800 --> 25:37.588
or epidural
with the patient awake.

25:37.630 --> 25:41.589
Reminds me
there's a real person here
entrusting me with their life

25:41.640 --> 25:44.131
rather than a lump of meat
that I'm about to reorganize.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.866
And in this instance,

25:46.910 --> 25:49.276
I would like to see the look
on your face.

25:49.310 --> 25:52.347
- Please... You're not
the Chesapeake Ripper.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.871
- You got inside my mind,
Frederick.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.686
It's only fair
I get inside your belly.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.018
This is of course
Freddie Lounds, who you know.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.757
She will be assisting me today--
or assisting you--by manually
pumping the ventilator

26:04.790 --> 26:07.691
should you stop breathing.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.322
- Oh, my god.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.839
- The real Chesapeake Ripper is
a collector

26:20.880 --> 26:22.836
of surgical trophies.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.144
I'm gonna leave him
a little gift.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.740
In fact, I'm gonna leave him
a gift basket.

26:51.170 --> 26:54.139
You know, it is truly amazing

26:54.180 --> 26:58.640
how many organs the body can
offer up before it really
begins to suffer.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.248
All right, stay awake now!
Come on, Frederick.

27:08.290 --> 27:11.623
I'm gonna ask you
to hold a few things.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.758
Hmm. What next?

27:25.240 --> 27:27.834
- (Jack): I want you to wait
outside.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.949
- That's probably best.

27:31.980 --> 27:34.119
- You look like hell, Will.

27:34.150 --> 27:36.846
- I feel like hell.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.383
Actually, no, I feel...

27:39.420 --> 27:41.980
uh, fluid,

27:42.020 --> 27:45.023
like I'm spilling.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.355
Must have come down
with something.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.392
I hope it's not contagious.

27:52.430 --> 27:56.992
(Jack's voice distant)
- This work that we do...

27:57.040 --> 28:00.703
(Jack's voice normal)
...it will compromise your
immune system, if you allow it.

28:00.740 --> 28:03.868
You've got to keep things
in perspective. You've got
to keep yourself in perspective.

28:03.910 --> 28:06.378
- Well, myself is a little hazy
at the moment.

28:06.410 --> 28:09.447
- You've gotta start
taking better care of yourself.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.211
- Build my resistance?
- You just can't take it all in.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.759
You've got to let go
of as much of it as you can.

28:18.790 --> 28:22.294
You just gotta let go.
- You know, it's hard

28:22.330 --> 28:26.164
to shake off something
that's already under your skin.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.832
- Mark.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.409
Go!

29:55.490 --> 29:58.857
- Clear. Clear.
No sign of Gideon.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.029
- He's still alive.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.995
- I need medical in here now!

30:04.030 --> 30:06.089
- Gideon's gone.

30:44.970 --> 30:48.098
- I was expecting
the Chesapeake Ripper.

30:51.010 --> 30:53.001
Or are you he?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.418
- Turn around. Don't look at me.

31:03.460 --> 31:07.089
- You are looking
a little peaky,

31:07.130 --> 31:12.022
Mr. Graham,
if you don't mind my saying.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.335
Call me crazy, but you look ill.

31:15.370 --> 31:18.533
- Drive.

31:18.570 --> 31:21.004
- Who is your doctor?

31:30.450 --> 31:33.283
- I'm having a hard time
thinking.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.982
(Will panting)

31:36.020 --> 31:40.127
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I-I don't know what's real.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.522
- It's 7:27 PM.

31:47.570 --> 31:51.609
You're in Baltimore, Maryland,
and your name is Will Graham.
- No I don't care who I am!

31:51.640 --> 31:54.234
Just tell me...

31:54.280 --> 31:56.134
if he's real.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.311
- Who do you see, Will?

32:06.550 --> 32:08.586
- Garret Jacob Hobbs.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.611
Who do you see?

32:17.030 --> 32:18.520
- I don't see anyone.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.492
- No, he's right there.

32:20.530 --> 32:22.498
- There's no one there, Will.
- No, no, you're lying.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.532
- We're alone.
You came here alone.
Do you remember coming here?

32:25.570 --> 32:28.209
- No, please don't lie to me!
- Garret Jacob Hobbs is dead.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.208
You killed him.
You watched him die.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.175
- What's happening to me?
- Will,

32:33.210 --> 32:35.713
Will, Will, you're having
an episode. I want you

32:35.750 --> 32:39.481
to hand me over the gun. Will,
I want you to hand me your...

32:39.520 --> 32:41.283
Will?

32:41.320 --> 32:42.719
Will.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.576
He's had a mild seizure.

33:10.620 --> 33:14.454
- That doesn't seem
to bother you.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.323
- I said it was mild.

33:23.630 --> 33:27.361
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

33:27.400 --> 33:30.437
- Why do you say "claimed"?

33:30.470 --> 33:33.439
- Because you're not.
You know you're not,

33:33.470 --> 33:36.177
and you don't know much more
about who you are beyond that.

33:36.210 --> 33:39.179
- Are you the Ripper?

33:39.210 --> 33:41.747
- A terrible thing...

33:41.780 --> 33:44.783
to have your identity taken
from you.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.418
- Well, I'm taking it back,

33:49.460 --> 33:51.826
one piece at a time.

33:51.860 --> 33:55.523
You should see the pieces
I got out of my psychiatrist.

33:58.530 --> 34:01.499
- Alana Bloom was
one of your psychiatrists too.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.269
Is that right?

34:03.300 --> 34:07.134
- Yes. Dr. Bloom.

34:12.410 --> 34:14.571
- I can tell you
where to find her.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.784
Will, can you hear me?

34:32.270 --> 34:34.488
Repeat after me.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.498
My name is Will Graham.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.269
- My name is Will Graham.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.848
- Raise both of your arms.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.508
More.

34:47.550 --> 34:50.519
More.

34:50.550 --> 34:53.383
Good.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.412
Although you may not feel
like it, I need you to smile.

35:04.830 --> 35:08.129
Good. It wasn't a stroke.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.866
You may have had a seizure.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.164
Tell me the last thing
you remember.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.178
- I...

35:15.210 --> 35:17.599
(Will panting)

35:17.640 --> 35:19.642
I was
with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.743
- You have a fever.

35:27.790 --> 35:30.657
You were hallucinating.
You thought he was alive,

35:30.690 --> 35:33.557
here in the room with you.
- I saw him.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.593
- He's a delusion
disguising reality.

35:36.630 --> 35:40.396
Don't let that
let you slip away.

35:40.430 --> 35:43.467
You killed
Garret Jacob Hobbs once.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.899
You can find

35:44.940 --> 35:47.135
a way to kill him again.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.576
- Where are you going?
- Abel Gideon is still

35:52.610 --> 35:54.714
at large.
He mutilated Dr. Chilton.

35:54.750 --> 35:57.639
They found him
clinging to life.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.784
I'm worried about Alana.

35:59.820 --> 36:03.756
- Alana. _
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Will.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.758
You're in no state to go

36:05.790 --> 36:08.759
anywhere but the hospital.
I'll call Jack

36:08.800 --> 36:10.756
and tell him where you are.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.485
- I have to make a phone call.
Can I ask you to step out?

37:14.700 --> 37:21.026
- I don't know if I will
ever be myself again.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.858
I don't know if I've got
any "self" left over.

37:24.910 --> 37:28.869
I spent so long
thinking I was him,

37:28.910 --> 37:33.802
it's gotten really hard
to remember who I was
when I wasn't him.

37:37.750 --> 37:41.015
- Who are you now?

37:41.050 --> 37:44.281
- Now I'm you.

37:44.330 --> 37:48.528
We're both here,
looking at her,

37:48.560 --> 37:52.690
just those kind of people that
shouldn't be in a relationship.

37:52.730 --> 37:56.939
You and I are
already committed.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.939
It's hard to be
with another person when you...

37:59.970 --> 38:03.599
can't get out
of your own head.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.404
- I want to get out.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.418
- Yeah, well,

38:08.450 --> 38:10.771
we all want things
that we can't have.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.781
But if I kill her

38:14.820 --> 38:18.426
like he would kill her,
then maybe

38:18.460 --> 38:22.089
I could
understand him better.

38:22.130 --> 38:26.863
I wonder if _then
you would finally
understand what you've become.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.370
(gunshot)

38:52.890 --> 38:55.597
- They will be sewing up

38:55.630 --> 38:57.598
Dr. Chilton until the morning--

38:57.630 --> 38:59.495
that is, if he makes it
through the night.

38:59.530 --> 39:02.533
- At least Will remains
in one piece--

39:02.570 --> 39:04.435
for now.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.836
His temperature is 105.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.599
White blood cell count is

39:13.650 --> 39:17.711
twice normal, and they still
can't identify the source
of his infection.

39:17.750 --> 39:21.516
- They will.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.516
- You seem confident.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.028
-Iam.

39:26.060 --> 39:29.154
Even with a temperature
of 105 degrees, Will was able

39:29.200 --> 39:32.499
to bring Gideon down.
I told you, he'll be fine.

39:32.530 --> 39:36.091
-Jack".

39:36.140 --> 39:39.860
I would recommend you suspend
his license to carry firearms.

39:39.910 --> 39:44.404
- You and I are just gonna have
to have a difference of opinion
about who Will is, Doctor.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.975
- I know who Will is.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.444
Will knows who he is.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.414
- Yes.

39:51.450 --> 39:53.816
- But our experiences shape us,
Jack.

39:56.490 --> 40:00.449
How is this experience going
to shape Will?

40:00.490 --> 40:03.493
(monitor beeping)
(ventilator pumping)

40:24.950 --> 40:26.941
(birds singing)

40:31.090 --> 40:33.979
Will Graham is troubled.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.999
- And that troubles you?

40:37.030 --> 40:40.591
Beyond a professional concern
for a patient?

40:40.630 --> 40:43.895
- I see his madness
and I want to contain it,

40:43.940 --> 40:45.908
like an oil spill.

40:45.940 --> 40:49.034
- Oil is valuable.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.819
What value does Will Graham's
madness have for you?

40:54.850 --> 40:58.616
- You're suggesting
I'm more fascinated
with the madness than the man?

40:58.650 --> 41:00.481
- Are you?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.579
- No.

41:07.530 --> 41:09.896
He realized early on
that he saw things differently

41:09.930 --> 41:13.696
than other people,
felt things differently.

41:13.730 --> 41:16.699
- So did you.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.004
- I see myself in Will.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.838
- Do you see yourself
in his madness?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.809
- Madness can be a medicine
for the modern world.

41:26.850 --> 41:29.569
You take it in moderation,
it's beneficial.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.919
- You overdose and it can have
unfortunate side effects.

41:32.950 --> 41:36.511
- Side effects can be temporary.
They can be a boost

41:36.560 --> 41:38.858
to our psychological
immune systems to help fight

41:38.890 --> 41:41.654
the existential_crises
of normal life.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.123
- Will Graham does not

41:44.160 --> 41:46.765
present you with problems
from normal life.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.009
- No. He doesn't.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.031
- What does he
present you with?

42:00.050 --> 42:02.746
- The opportunity
for friendship.

42:02.780 --> 42:05.613
- He is still your patient,
Hannibal.

42:05.650 --> 42:07.743
Where Will Graham is concerned,

42:07.790 --> 42:11.112
if you feel the impulse
to step forward,

42:11.160 --> 42:14.789
you must force yourself
to take a step back.

42:14.830 --> 42:18.766
- And just watch him
lose his mind?

42:18.800 --> 42:21.098
- Sometimes all we can do
is watch.
