My mum's house
was broken into last night.

00:03.015 --> 00:05.695
He was in Jesse's room
looking through family photos.

00:05.855 --> 00:08.175
- Couldn't see his face.
- It was Jesse.

00:08.335 --> 00:10.855
I chose him, I took him
and I killed him. Three acts.

00:11.055 --> 00:12.335
I'm convinced you didn't.

00:12.495 --> 00:14.815
Whatever happened,
it wasn't our fault.

00:14.975 --> 00:19.135
- Did you set out to kill Newman?
- Newman destroyed girls' lives.

00:19.295 --> 00:21.375
They found something else
in Newman's garden.

00:21.535 --> 00:23.895
The same picture book Jesse had.
Makes no sense.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.815
It's a reprint from ten years
after Jesse disappeared.

00:26.975 --> 00:28.615
- Sleep with him?
- Nothing happened.

00:28.775 --> 00:30.375
Moving back was
the worst thing we did!

00:30.535 --> 00:32.895
Today I was in the woods.
This guy was watching me.

00:33.055 --> 00:34.335
<i>Mark!</i>

00:35.095 --> 00:37.415
How many exits are there
to this building? Danny.

00:37.575 --> 00:40.015
- There's no-one up there.
- I'm just chasing someone.

00:40.175 --> 00:41.695
Someone is setting us up.

00:41.855 --> 00:45.055
- What is it?
- Jakob Marosi wants to see me.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.655
Thank you
for the food we eat.

00:51.055 --> 00:53.975
Thank you for the world so sweet.

00:54.135 --> 00:56.615
Thank you for the birds that sing.

00:57.215 --> 00:59.615
Thank you, God, for everything.

01:01.535 --> 01:02.695
God bless us.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.855
God bless the food.

01:05.415 --> 01:06.455
Amen.

01:13.455 --> 01:15.255
Oh, we got a letter
from the Missionary Society

01:15.415 --> 01:16.735
thanking us for the donation.

01:17.335 --> 01:19.215
I'll let you have a look.

01:21.935 --> 01:23.735
It came yesterday.

01:25.775 --> 01:26.655
Here we are.

01:44.535 --> 01:50.255
Before anything, can I apologise
for the way I spoke to you last time?

01:50.655 --> 01:52.375
It's unacceptable.

01:53.975 --> 01:55.495
And I'm sorry.

01:55.655 --> 01:58.015
You said there is something
you want to show us.

01:58.655 --> 01:59.575
Yes.

02:00.975 --> 02:03.975
I want to show you where Jesse Wells
is buried.

02:08.935 --> 02:10.175
Oh, yeah?

02:12.055 --> 02:15.255
Why? Why are you offering this now?

02:15.415 --> 02:17.735
This last week...

02:19.735 --> 02:23.055
I'm reliving how I killed this boy.

02:25.455 --> 02:27.335
I dream it when I sleep.

02:28.255 --> 02:30.295
And it comes when I am awake.

02:33.775 --> 02:35.375
It's constant.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.695
And for the first time,

02:37.855 --> 02:41.095
I see the dreadful thing I did
all those years ago.

02:43.495 --> 02:45.535
The worst a man can do.

02:46.815 --> 02:48.215
For any child.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.055
And their parents.

02:54.495 --> 02:56.495
And when you realise that,

02:57.015 --> 02:58.015
well...

02:59.375 --> 03:01.695
the least I can do is...

03:01.975 --> 03:04.655
offer some closure for the family.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.375
And perhaps for myself as well.

03:08.615 --> 03:09.975
That's lovely.

03:10.135 --> 03:12.895
You say you want to show us
where Jesse is buried?

03:13.295 --> 03:15.815
- Yes.
- Why not just tell us?

03:16.415 --> 03:18.215
It was 20 years ago.

03:18.655 --> 03:21.175
But I will know when I see it.

03:21.975 --> 03:26.415
It was among
the sand dunes up the coast.

03:26.695 --> 03:28.455
Where they train the horses.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.615
I think someone wants
a day at the seaside.

03:31.815 --> 03:34.935
I want the parents
to have their child back.

03:36.095 --> 03:38.055
Relive it.
You're reliving it every night.

03:38.215 --> 03:41.255
Relive it now. Where is he buried?

03:41.695 --> 03:44.615
I'll tell you what I do remember
of this burial.

03:47.935 --> 03:51.495
When I'm laying his tiny body
in the ground,

03:52.615 --> 03:56.175
he's wearing a red jacket
with a hood.

03:56.615 --> 03:58.575
It slipped off his shoulder.

03:59.415 --> 04:01.535
And as I pulled it up,

04:01.695 --> 04:03.855
I see a name tag.

04:06.015 --> 04:07.655
On the inside.

04:07.855 --> 04:08.855
There.

04:10.175 --> 04:12.855
And it says, "Mark Wells."

04:15.095 --> 04:17.935
And until I saw the news reports,

04:18.214 --> 04:20.495
that was who I thought I had killed.

04:27.975 --> 04:30.655
I can't move my jaw.
I mean, I can, but...

04:31.015 --> 04:32.735
it feels like I can't.

04:33.095 --> 04:36.335
- And then...
- OK. OK. It's OK, Hayley.

04:36.495 --> 04:38.975
Hayley, look at me.
It's OK. You've got to breathe.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.855
Breathe. OK.

04:42.695 --> 04:44.735
Everything is fine. OK?

04:44.895 --> 04:47.335
The benzodiazepines I have given you
are gonna kick in.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.535
You're gonna feel fine,
but you've got to breathe.

04:52.135 --> 04:53.175
OK, good girl.

04:54.655 --> 04:57.935
I think you might have to consider
the fact that MDMA and you don't mix.

04:58.095 --> 05:00.095
Nah, we mix fine. It's just...

05:00.335 --> 05:03.095
once in a while, that's all.
Who cares?

05:04.135 --> 05:06.495
Look at Britnay.
We can die at any time.

05:06.655 --> 05:08.215
We can die just like that.

05:08.495 --> 05:10.375
So why stop anything?

05:11.575 --> 05:14.375
Just try and take care of yourself
today, Hayley.

05:14.535 --> 05:16.215
OK? Drink lots of water.

05:16.975 --> 05:19.455
Any chance I could get
a few more of those benzies?

05:19.615 --> 05:21.615
You cheeky monkey, get out.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.415
Why are you asking this?

05:36.975 --> 05:40.215
We just review the evidence in
every case after a couple of weeks.

05:40.935 --> 05:43.815
So, to the best of your knowledge,
when Jesse went out that day

05:43.975 --> 05:46.055
- he was wearing...?
- A red hoodie,

05:46.215 --> 05:47.935
jeans and a t-shirt.

05:49.095 --> 05:53.175
- Tell us about the hoodie.
- Well, it was a hand-me-down.

05:53.335 --> 05:55.015
It wasn't new.
It was Mark's originally.

05:56.575 --> 05:58.295
It had been washed for ever.

05:58.455 --> 06:00.215
- Did it have a name tag?
- No.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.655
You only ever label
your first kid's clothes.

06:02.975 --> 06:04.335
The rest can go...

06:05.415 --> 06:06.335
No, hold on.

06:07.015 --> 06:09.295
It would have had
Mark's name tag on it.

06:09.455 --> 06:13.375
That would still be there cause it
was a sew-in one, not stick-on.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.095
Why are you interested in it?

06:17.255 --> 06:19.295
Like I said, it's just procedure.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.135
Yeah?

06:26.335 --> 06:29.135
- Hi, can I have a word?
- Yeah, course. Come in.

06:30.415 --> 06:32.015
- You got mail.
- Ooh.

06:32.175 --> 06:33.655
Must be a fixture.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.375
Oh.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.615
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:44.015 --> 06:46.575
Yeah. No, I am fine.

06:46.735 --> 06:48.695
I... I got called out at...

06:50.135 --> 06:51.695
3:34.

06:51.855 --> 06:54.215
And then I went to work
and then I came straight here,

06:54.375 --> 06:56.775
so I'm a bit spaced.

06:57.415 --> 06:58.775
Right.

07:00.055 --> 07:01.135
Um...

07:01.335 --> 07:03.895
Yes, I was speaking
with Hayley earlier.

07:04.055 --> 07:05.255
Do you know Hayley?

07:06.575 --> 07:08.695
Yeah, course you do.

07:10.175 --> 07:12.495
Well, she was talking about...

07:12.815 --> 07:14.095
Britnay.

07:15.015 --> 07:16.575
But in a really nihilistic way.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.695
Like, "Why bother with anything?
What's the point?"

07:20.135 --> 07:23.015
"What happened to Britnay
could happen to everyone else."

07:23.695 --> 07:25.575
I just thought you should know.

07:27.215 --> 07:29.175
We really missed you, Slade.

07:31.975 --> 07:34.335
I haven't dealt with this at all,
have I?

08:00.615 --> 08:01.895
Come on! Up we get!

08:02.055 --> 08:04.295
There you go.
Come on, up on your feet.

08:05.815 --> 08:07.335
Come on.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.255
There we go. This way.

08:15.175 --> 08:16.735
That's it. There we go.

08:17.495 --> 08:18.775
No way!

08:37.495 --> 08:39.015
Slade, sorry. I got a...

08:39.174 --> 08:40.174
Hi, Stuart.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.615
What? Airport?

08:44.575 --> 08:47.175
What do you mean?
You can't just take her.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.815
Excuse me, mate.
Is that your van outside?

09:15.415 --> 09:18.695
Yeah. Can you just give me two
minutes, please? Would you just...

09:18.855 --> 09:20.175
We're doing this...

09:20.335 --> 09:22.255
Look, listen, please.

09:22.735 --> 09:25.015
- What's this about?
- Step outside straightaway.

09:25.175 --> 09:26.495
Come with me outside.

09:29.815 --> 09:31.575
What are you doing?

09:31.735 --> 09:34.015
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

09:39.615 --> 09:42.135
- Suspicion of murdering who?
- Jay Newman.

09:42.975 --> 09:46.415
- You've got the wrong man, pal.
- Can you sort the kids out, please?

09:46.575 --> 09:48.295
- It's all right, it's fine.
- Go back inside.

10:23.615 --> 10:25.455
Here. Here.

10:29.975 --> 10:31.215
Wait.

10:35.975 --> 10:38.655
Mr Marosi,
specific directions, please.

10:38.815 --> 10:40.535
It's been 20 years.

10:41.655 --> 10:43.495
The landscape changes.

10:44.815 --> 10:46.295
This way. Come.

11:09.655 --> 11:11.455
What's all this about?

11:11.615 --> 11:14.535
What's happened? Slade,
what have you been arrested for?

11:14.895 --> 11:17.455
It's in connection
with the Jay Newman murder.

11:18.175 --> 11:20.135
Are you out of your mind
calling me in?

11:20.295 --> 11:22.295
Who was I supposed to call, Mark?

11:22.455 --> 11:24.935
Slade, I know. You've told me.

11:35.215 --> 11:36.895
- That's yours.
- Thank you.

11:45.015 --> 11:48.135
Before we get started,
can I just confirm that...

11:48.975 --> 11:51.575
you're investigating a murder
of a Mr Jay Newman

11:51.735 --> 11:53.815
at his home on Manville Avenue

11:54.335 --> 11:55.975
on the afternoon
of the 22nd of this month?

11:56.135 --> 11:57.175
That's correct.

11:57.815 --> 12:00.255
The client's van matches,
or is similar to,

12:00.415 --> 12:02.335
a van seen outside
Mr Newman's address

12:02.495 --> 12:03.815
at the estimated time of death.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.855
I just want to confirm.
This is important.

12:10.735 --> 12:12.135
The 22nd of this month?

12:12.695 --> 12:14.775
- The 22nd.
- I'm gonna have to halt proceedings.

12:18.695 --> 12:20.455
I can't be a solicitor on this case.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.175
You see, on the afternoon
of the 22nd...

12:26.375 --> 12:27.935
my client was with me.

12:31.175 --> 12:32.895
What do you mean "with" you?

12:33.655 --> 12:35.175
At my place, my apartment.

12:36.535 --> 12:41.135
Early morning till late evening.
He was with me. The whole time.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.855
An alibi was above and beyond, Mark.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

12:48.055 --> 12:51.975
Don't thank me.
OK, Slade, you do my head in.

12:52.135 --> 12:54.815
You really do.
If you're so smart,

12:54.975 --> 12:57.815
what's gonna happen to the kids
in the shelter if you go to prison?

12:57.975 --> 13:00.615
You getting picked up is proof enough

13:00.775 --> 13:03.055
that your actions
do have consequences.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.615
And they've got your DNA now.

13:04.775 --> 13:08.015
So you'd really better hope
that you were careful enough.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.575
Here. It's here.

13:26.135 --> 13:27.335
Are you sure?

13:28.135 --> 13:29.375
I feel it.

13:31.175 --> 13:33.055
OK. This is our spot.

13:33.215 --> 13:34.895
Let's get to digging.

13:41.135 --> 13:42.735
Bring it in, guys.

13:47.735 --> 13:48.895
Nice wind.

13:51.055 --> 13:52.215
That sun.

13:54.455 --> 13:55.655
Warm.

13:56.255 --> 13:57.175
Great.

14:33.815 --> 14:35.015
Hello.

14:36.655 --> 14:37.695
Hi.

14:52.735 --> 14:54.735
Something isn't right, Ally.

14:55.655 --> 14:57.535
It's a wind-up.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.895
Look at him.

15:19.535 --> 15:21.815
Would you mind
if I pop to the ladies?

15:49.055 --> 15:50.615
Another drink, then?

15:51.735 --> 15:53.095
Cheers.

15:53.255 --> 15:54.815
To new friends.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.615
Let's get some fresh air.
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.815
Hey, how's it going?

16:19.375 --> 16:20.935
The lady's with me.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.335
You what?

16:24.495 --> 16:26.095
Go and sit down.

16:26.415 --> 16:28.135
What's your problem?

16:36.095 --> 16:37.615
- It's OK.
- Come on.

16:37.775 --> 16:39.655
- Pru. Jesus.
- He took her...

16:39.815 --> 16:42.215
- He took her while I was here.
- Pru, sit down.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.095
- He took her.
- Jesus.

16:44.935 --> 16:47.215
I called Nico at the airport.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.415
They were about to
get on the flight.

16:51.255 --> 16:53.455
So you thought you'd take
some more pills?

16:53.895 --> 16:54.935
Hmm?

16:56.135 --> 16:59.935
Diazepam. I can tell, Pru.
I can see it in your eyes.

17:00.095 --> 17:01.935
Half the kids here are on it.
That's how I know.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.895
- I'm gonna call Mark.
- No, you're not.

17:04.255 --> 17:06.055
He's gonna listen to me.

17:08.734 --> 17:10.815
- Give me the phone.
- I love him. I love Mark.

17:10.974 --> 17:12.815
No, you'll get over it, Pru.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.694
I got over you.

17:17.855 --> 17:20.415
I thought I was in love with you.
Now look at me.

17:22.535 --> 17:24.015
Nothing. Not a pang.

17:26.575 --> 17:28.095
You don't understand.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.135
OK.

17:29.855 --> 17:33.655
I've always loved Mark.

17:34.615 --> 17:36.575
And I'm gonna call him.

17:37.135 --> 17:38.975
- And I'm gonna tell him.
- Pru.

17:39.135 --> 17:41.015
- Look at you. Look at you.
- Ow!

17:41.175 --> 17:42.455
Look at you!

17:46.815 --> 17:48.935
You're fucked up, Pru.

17:49.095 --> 17:51.215
Now, you listen to me,
until you're unfucked-up,

17:51.375 --> 17:53.935
you leave Mark well alone.
I am not having you

17:54.095 --> 17:55.975
going on some off-your-faced whim

17:56.135 --> 17:58.415
only to go and break his heart
all over again.

17:58.575 --> 18:02.135
I won't have it, because that is
exactly what you did last time.

18:03.255 --> 18:05.575
And don't you dare think
that just cos we were kids

18:05.735 --> 18:07.575
that it didn't mean anything.

18:09.135 --> 18:11.055
He never got over you, Pru.

18:19.535 --> 18:21.095
Before you even think about
calling him,

18:21.255 --> 18:24.055
just get yourself clean, Pru.
Sort yourself out.

18:27.735 --> 18:29.655
DS Kenwood, we've got something.

18:29.815 --> 18:31.535
What? What have you got?

18:31.695 --> 18:33.535
- Just down there.
- What is it?

18:34.055 --> 18:35.255
Get out of the way.

18:49.935 --> 18:52.055
Are you sure
you want to be here for this?

18:53.375 --> 18:54.575
Yeah.

18:56.455 --> 18:58.055
I'm just...

18:58.255 --> 19:01.255
figuring out what I'm gonna tell
Julie and Alan.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.615
And Mark.

19:13.815 --> 19:15.135
Danny.

19:17.135 --> 19:19.055
They have to run some tests, but...

19:19.775 --> 19:21.695
Judging by the remnants of clothes,

19:21.855 --> 19:24.255
and the hair, and the shoe...

19:24.415 --> 19:26.535
- Yeah?
- This is a little girl.

19:29.855 --> 19:32.295
- What?
- Well, it's... it's a young girl.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.655
It can't be Jesse.

19:36.135 --> 19:37.815
What do you mean, it's a...?

19:42.615 --> 19:45.855
Oh, that's right.
That's the little Reddington girl.

19:47.975 --> 19:50.815
You are as useless as your father.

19:53.695 --> 19:54.935
Danny!

19:56.135 --> 19:57.535
Get off me!

20:00.015 --> 20:01.615
Get him down the station.

20:04.295 --> 20:05.535
Bastard!

20:45.375 --> 20:48.015
I think you might have
actually chased a real person.

20:48.175 --> 20:50.175
Danny, I think I'm losing my mind.

20:52.175 --> 20:54.175
If you're losing it, I'm losing it.

20:54.975 --> 20:57.455
But if I was chasing someone,
that means they disappeared.

20:57.615 --> 20:59.615
- They evaporated.
- I know.

21:00.855 --> 21:03.935
We find Jesse's DNA at the place
where the girls were kept.

21:04.095 --> 21:07.255
We also find the Gulliver's Travel
picture book there.

21:07.415 --> 21:09.895
Yeah, but it's a 2005 reprint.

21:10.495 --> 21:12.695
Right. Then your mum and dad's
gets broken into.

21:12.855 --> 21:13.895
I mean...

21:14.935 --> 21:16.695
either Jesse is still alive...

21:17.935 --> 21:20.215
or this is some massive hoax.

21:20.415 --> 21:21.855
And if it's a hoax?

21:23.535 --> 21:25.615
I think Jakob Marosi is behind this.

21:27.975 --> 21:29.375
He's inside. It's not possible.

21:31.095 --> 21:32.495
How could he do that?

21:33.095 --> 21:35.815
- You think he's working people?
- I've got no idea.

21:35.975 --> 21:37.055
What I do know

21:37.695 --> 21:41.135
is that he is the sickest bastard
that I have ever come across.

21:42.095 --> 21:44.375
And if he can wind you up, he will.

21:48.895 --> 21:51.215
Marosi used to write letters
to my dad from prison.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.135
What?

21:55.295 --> 21:58.535
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I'm sorry. I just...

21:58.895 --> 22:01.655
Listen, that's not even possible.
He's a Category-A prisoner.

22:01.815 --> 22:04.255
They wouldn't allow him
to write to victims.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.815
Well, he did.

22:10.575 --> 22:13.055
Unless he was getting someone
to do it for him.

22:14.175 --> 22:15.455
You two still here?

22:15.615 --> 22:17.775
- Dad, come on.
- How many letters did you get?

22:17.935 --> 22:21.015
What part don't you understand?
I don't want to talk about it.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.255
At all. Quite clear? Here we are.

22:23.415 --> 22:26.255
Danny, come on. Let's go.

22:27.775 --> 22:30.015
He burnt them all as they came in.

22:30.175 --> 22:32.375
This one he just forgot
the envelope.

22:37.255 --> 22:38.615
Mum, did you read the letters?

22:38.775 --> 22:41.495
I saw bits of some of them.
Alan never gave them to me.

22:41.655 --> 22:42.855
They made him so mad.

22:43.855 --> 22:46.255
Same printed address on each letter,
by the way.

22:46.735 --> 22:49.455
He had them made
with one of those rubber stamps.

22:50.375 --> 22:54.415
Every letter I did see went on
about there being three acts.

22:54.935 --> 22:56.455
Don't know what that meant

22:56.615 --> 22:59.615
but those two words
would fill a whole page sometimes.

22:59.775 --> 23:01.175
"Three acts."

23:02.255 --> 23:03.375
When did he get these?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.175
Quite early on. Ninety-eight, '99.

23:08.055 --> 23:09.815
Maybe ten letters in all.

23:12.855 --> 23:14.375
What, Danny? What is it?

23:16.055 --> 23:17.855
There's a postmark.

23:24.575 --> 23:27.215
New lead. Alan Wells, circa 1998,

23:27.375 --> 23:30.255
received letters purportedly
from Jakob Marosi.

23:31.255 --> 23:33.255
No, he burned them.
And he won't talk about them.

23:33.415 --> 23:36.735
But we do have one of the envelopes
postmarked from Malten,

23:36.895 --> 23:39.295
which is 120 miles south of here,

23:39.455 --> 23:43.615
but six miles from where Marosi
was imprisoned in 1998.

23:44.655 --> 23:47.575
I haven't finished.
From March, 1997

23:47.735 --> 23:49.695
till he was moved up here in 2000,

23:49.855 --> 23:52.575
Jakob Marosi's only prison visitor

23:52.895 --> 23:57.575
was an Angela Clark,
who lives then and now in Malten.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.295
That's her.

24:00.375 --> 24:01.695
Fancy a drive?

24:01.855 --> 24:04.175
Shouldn't we run all of this
past the DI first?

24:04.335 --> 24:06.495
The envelope is in the forensics
bag. Get it to Ken

24:06.655 --> 24:09.415
and tell him
I want everything and anything PDQ.

24:09.575 --> 24:12.375
- What does that even mean?
- Oh, look, here's his boyfriend.

24:12.535 --> 24:15.575
You can take it down to him.
Ally's got something for you.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.735
I'm gonna go and get my jacket.

24:20.575 --> 24:22.215
Hi. Um...

24:23.335 --> 24:24.695
This is for Ken. It's urgent.

24:26.895 --> 24:28.775
Do I need to apologise
for the other night?

24:29.535 --> 24:32.455
To me? I doubt it.
I usually get everything I deserve.

24:32.615 --> 24:35.095
No, I... I think I do. I...

24:36.135 --> 24:37.375
- Um...
- I mean,

24:37.535 --> 24:40.255
- you could always...
- Ally, we gotta go.

24:41.575 --> 24:43.815
- I'll...
- Ally, please.

24:51.215 --> 24:54.735
- Welcome to Malten.
- I think it's this one.

25:02.855 --> 25:04.055
- Angela Clark?
- Yes.

25:04.215 --> 25:05.535
DS Kenwood, DC Caine.

25:06.415 --> 25:08.375
Do you mind
if we have a word inside?

25:08.935 --> 25:10.615
Would anyone like
a cup of tea?

25:10.775 --> 25:13.135
No. Actually, I'd like Mrs Clark
to answer my questions.

25:13.295 --> 25:15.895
Actually, yes, I would.
Thanks. Milk, one sugar.

25:22.135 --> 25:24.615
OK, so let's try again, shall we?

25:25.335 --> 25:27.775
When you were a prison visitor
to Jakob Marosi,

25:27.935 --> 25:30.335
did you ever send letters
on his behalf?

25:30.535 --> 25:33.535
Did you think there was something I
wouldn't say in front of my husband?

25:34.095 --> 25:34.935
Is there?

25:35.775 --> 25:36.815
No.

25:37.175 --> 25:40.655
Mrs Clark,
did Jakob Marosi ever ask you

25:40.815 --> 25:42.535
to smuggle letters out for him?

25:42.695 --> 25:44.215
That wouldn't be allowed.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.335
That's not an answer
to the question.

25:49.495 --> 25:51.055
Angela, if you refuse to cooperate,

25:51.215 --> 25:53.335
you'll be down at the station
in the morning.

25:53.495 --> 25:56.335
Could we make that the afternoon?
We go to church Sunday mornings.

25:59.895 --> 26:01.495
Mrs Clark, please.

26:01.775 --> 26:03.295
Someone posted letters to the father

26:03.455 --> 26:06.975
of one of the children Jakob Marosi
claims to have murdered.

26:07.415 --> 26:09.575
They were posted from this town.

26:12.295 --> 26:14.095
Did you post those letters?

26:16.015 --> 26:17.895
I know one thing for certain.

26:18.615 --> 26:20.415
Jakob has repented his sins.

26:20.575 --> 26:24.535
He has redeemed himself and now
rejoices in the love of Jesus.

26:25.855 --> 26:27.055
Mm-hm.

26:27.535 --> 26:30.415
Do you know what Jakob Marosi
did to his victims?

26:30.895 --> 26:32.615
- To children?
- Of course.

26:33.215 --> 26:35.055
He confessed all his crimes to me.

26:35.215 --> 26:39.055
But draw closer to God
and he will draw closer to you.

26:39.215 --> 26:41.615
Jakob Marosi is
a vicious psychopath, Mrs Clark.

26:41.775 --> 26:43.015
He was possessed.

26:43.775 --> 26:46.055
He... He was possessed.

26:46.215 --> 26:48.295
Sorry, by who? The devil?

26:48.455 --> 26:49.575
Yes, of course.

26:50.815 --> 26:54.135
But through redemption
he is saved. Yes.

26:54.735 --> 26:57.975
You don't believe and so
it's impossible for you to understand.

26:58.375 --> 27:01.055
You know, sorry, Mrs Clark,
I have to say,

27:01.215 --> 27:03.775
I've been face to face
with Jakob Marosi

27:03.935 --> 27:09.095
a number of times and he is the most
unrepentant, manipulative criminal

27:09.255 --> 27:10.935
I've ever had
the misfortune to meet.

27:11.175 --> 27:13.975
We fight the devil
with his own weapons.

27:17.575 --> 27:19.655
I'm sorry, are you saying
that I'm an emissary for the devil?

27:23.295 --> 27:24.735
Milk and sugar?

27:26.335 --> 27:27.975
We don't have enough
to go any further.

27:28.135 --> 27:30.935
We'll never get a warrant, and if we did,
what would we look for?

27:31.095 --> 27:33.695
A rubber address stamp?
Imagine putting that to the DI.

27:33.895 --> 27:34.975
Yeah.

27:36.935 --> 27:38.735
So we drop it, yeah?

27:39.335 --> 27:41.215
I'm not saying
there's nothing in it.

27:41.375 --> 27:43.615
I'd put a week's pay on her having
posted those letters.

27:43.775 --> 27:46.935
There was something in that cupboard
she didn't want us to see.

27:47.095 --> 27:48.655
But we haven't got any evidence.

27:51.255 --> 27:54.335
Danny, I'm not moving from this spot
until you say we drop it.

27:54.535 --> 27:56.375
Yeah, yeah, we drop it.

28:03.895 --> 28:05.815
You've been asleep for ages.

28:06.055 --> 28:07.615
Thanks.

28:08.575 --> 28:10.135
I feel like shit.

28:10.775 --> 28:12.815
Sleeping Beauty's first words.

28:18.735 --> 28:20.615
I've got your stash, by the way.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.215
It was very neat in that pen.
Very neat.

28:25.815 --> 28:28.055
I'll be keeping that
in case you were wondering.

28:32.135 --> 28:33.975
I'm a complete mess.

28:34.615 --> 28:36.735
Stuart has just taken Nico
away without even asking me.

28:36.895 --> 28:39.575
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and get clean.

28:40.775 --> 28:42.175
If you're serious,

28:43.295 --> 28:46.575
the best way to do that
is to stay here with me.

28:46.735 --> 28:47.815
OK?

28:48.375 --> 28:49.295
OK.

28:50.535 --> 28:53.855
They won't be back from the States
till the end of the week.

28:54.015 --> 28:56.575
And, Slade... I heard what you said.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.735
Last night, about Mark.

29:00.735 --> 29:02.055
And I hate excuses.

29:02.215 --> 29:03.895
Feel there's a but coming.

29:04.415 --> 29:06.535
It's a good one.
Do you want to hear it?

29:06.695 --> 29:08.455
Go on, then.

29:08.615 --> 29:14.575
Seriously, what happened
to me, you, Danny and Mark...

29:16.415 --> 29:19.255
didn't we all go missing
the day Jesse disappeared?

29:21.175 --> 29:22.415
What happened to those kids

29:22.575 --> 29:25.095
that spent every single moment
together up until that point?

29:25.815 --> 29:27.815
Anyone ever see them again?

29:28.615 --> 29:31.655
I don't think so.
We were never those kids again.

29:35.255 --> 29:37.655
And you were all right,
you had each other.

29:38.335 --> 29:40.695
I got taken to the States.
No-one knew what happened...

29:40.855 --> 29:42.575
OK, stop right there.

29:42.735 --> 29:43.895
You're back now, Pru.

29:44.775 --> 29:47.575
You're not alone.
We will figure this out together.

29:47.735 --> 29:48.575
OK?

29:51.375 --> 29:52.895
Thank you.

29:58.015 --> 29:59.535
Thank you.

30:09.135 --> 30:10.215
Danny.

30:10.935 --> 30:12.655
Unexpected pleasure.

30:14.415 --> 30:17.575
Look, I... I don't know
if I'm asking you for advice

30:17.735 --> 30:19.855
or for help.

30:20.295 --> 30:21.455
Right.

30:21.775 --> 30:22.855
Um...

30:25.015 --> 30:26.535
Look, it's about Jesse.

30:27.015 --> 30:29.855
It's about finding out
whether he's alive or dead.

30:32.055 --> 30:33.695
Slade, why have we stopped?

30:33.855 --> 30:37.575
I thought I was taking you to some
youth workers' conference thing.

30:37.735 --> 30:40.255
No, I made that up.
No, I didn't tell you this

30:40.415 --> 30:43.415
because you'd just ask questions
all the way here, but...

30:43.815 --> 30:46.935
the family from that house there
are gonna go to church in a minute.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.695
And I want you to go with them.
And then...

30:50.335 --> 30:53.615
I want you to call me when they
set off to come back home.

30:53.775 --> 30:56.375
- Why? Where are you going?
- I'm gonna break in for Danny.

30:56.535 --> 30:58.495
- What?
- I'm not gonna steal anything.

30:58.655 --> 31:01.695
I'm just gonna look around
cause the lady from that house

31:01.855 --> 31:04.975
has posted letters to Alan
from Jakob Marosi.

31:07.575 --> 31:10.575
Oh, look. The mum and kids
are leaving the house now.

31:11.775 --> 31:12.895
Well, where's the dad?

31:14.495 --> 31:16.975
- No. Where's the dad?
- There he is. Look.

31:20.455 --> 31:21.415
I'll go, shall I?

31:23.735 --> 31:25.695
Say a little prayer for me.

32:55.415 --> 32:59.175
<i>♪ O worship the King ♪</i>

32:59.335 --> 33:03.335

34:06.735 --> 34:08.495
Let us pray.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.415
I am feeling fearful today.

34:17.695 --> 34:19.655
Life seems uncertain

34:19.975 --> 34:21.534
and out of control.

34:21.695 --> 34:27.135
I recall that the Bible tells me,
"Perfect love casts out fear."

34:27.295 --> 34:30.375
- I've left the potatoes on.
- You alone are perfect love.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.014
The fear I feel.

35:24.135 --> 35:25.935
Oh, thank you, Lord.

35:26.095 --> 35:27.415
Oh, thank you.

35:28.135 --> 35:30.215
I am so blessed.

35:30.495 --> 35:33.175
Therefore this is
what the Lord says.

35:33.495 --> 35:35.975
"You will not leave the bed
you are lying on.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.895
You will certainly die."

35:38.055 --> 35:39.175
So Elijah went.

35:40.135 --> 35:42.975
When the messengers returned
to the king, he asked them...

35:44.055 --> 35:45.335
Slade?

35:45.695 --> 35:47.695
Slade, the husband's not here.

35:48.095 --> 35:49.295
I think he might be on his way.

35:52.935 --> 35:54.815
Thanks for the warning.

35:59.815 --> 36:00.775
OK.

36:08.495 --> 36:10.895
All of us together
in one room at the same time.

36:11.895 --> 36:14.655
- It's nice, huh?
- Let's just get on with this.

36:15.535 --> 36:17.095
What are we waiting for?

36:17.255 --> 36:20.295
- It's uploading, be patient.
- What are we looking for?

36:20.535 --> 36:23.415
Well, if this woman was sending
letters from Marosi,

36:23.975 --> 36:26.575
I don't know,
anything from '98 or '99.

36:58.735 --> 37:00.095
OK.

37:00.255 --> 37:03.575
OK. I think I've got something.
Come and have a look at this.

37:09.335 --> 37:11.095
Right, so these are...

37:11.255 --> 37:13.615
annual bills for a storage facility.

37:14.375 --> 37:17.015
And it's right here in Westbridge.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.095
And not only that,

37:19.255 --> 37:22.935
it's right around the corner
from where Marosi used to live.

37:23.335 --> 37:24.895
And since 1998,

37:25.055 --> 37:27.495
it's been paid for
by Ms Angela Clark

37:27.935 --> 37:30.535
who lives 120 miles away in Malten.

37:31.775 --> 37:32.815
Wow.

37:33.575 --> 37:34.735
OK.

37:36.735 --> 37:39.335
What is it, Dan? What's wrong?

37:39.895 --> 37:43.055
It's me, I'm what's wrong.
I've stopped thinking. I can't...

37:44.335 --> 37:46.935
I can't use these.
How do I use this?

37:47.255 --> 37:49.815
OK, you go along to unit 92.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.415
You open it up.
You see what's inside.

37:52.815 --> 37:55.375
OK? Get a search warrant. It's easy.

37:55.535 --> 37:56.975
- But I can't do that.
- Why?

37:57.135 --> 38:00.535
Because when they ask me,
"How did you get these invoices?"

38:00.935 --> 38:03.415
Which they will ask.
That's the first thing they will ask.

38:03.575 --> 38:05.535
What do I say, hm?
How do I answer?

38:05.695 --> 38:08.135
I can't answer,
because I can't use this.

38:08.295 --> 38:09.495
Yeah, he's right.

38:10.615 --> 38:12.415
OK, you're right. You're right.

38:12.815 --> 38:14.295
So leave it to us, OK?

38:14.455 --> 38:16.335
- No...
- No, listen. You leave it to me.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.455
Right?

38:18.015 --> 38:21.375
We delete the files
that we've just uploaded, OK?

38:22.295 --> 38:23.535
Yeah, Danny.

38:25.615 --> 38:27.215
You're not involved in this.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.055
All right? You haven't seen this.

38:30.495 --> 38:32.215
We haven't even talked about it.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.655
All right? This does not exist.

38:35.335 --> 38:37.135
So you, Danny,

38:37.535 --> 38:39.255
- you go and be a policeman.
- Yeah.

38:39.415 --> 38:41.095
And you go
and investigate something.

38:41.255 --> 38:44.055
- What are you gonna do?
- We might go greyhound racing.

38:44.215 --> 38:45.655
- Now, listen.
- It's not funny.

38:45.815 --> 38:49.295
If we find anything,
then it will be delivered magically

38:49.455 --> 38:51.335
to you anonymously.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.455
OK? Good.

38:53.935 --> 38:55.855
Now, off you go, come on.

39:24.055 --> 39:25.295
Can I help you?

39:25.455 --> 39:27.975
24/7 access. 24/7 security.

39:28.135 --> 39:30.975
We have CCTV, alarms...

39:31.135 --> 39:32.975
We're right in the flight path
of the airport.

39:33.575 --> 39:35.055
What's available?

39:35.215 --> 39:38.215
- Bit of block one. All of block two.
- We'll take 101.

40:03.975 --> 40:06.375
Ah, the... the spirally thing,
it turned, but...

40:07.135 --> 40:08.895
nothing dropped out.

40:09.055 --> 40:10.855
It's the Seabrooks.

40:12.975 --> 40:14.295
Thanks, mate.

41:11.895 --> 41:13.695
Found anything?

41:20.375 --> 41:22.175
Hey, mate, what's that?

41:28.095 --> 41:29.975
A massive chain.

41:54.015 --> 41:55.175
Oh, Jesus.

42:06.375 --> 42:07.855
Look at these tapes.

42:15.135 --> 42:19.855
"Connor Tresco, 28th of July, 1993.
Seven years old."

42:25.415 --> 42:26.895
"Act one. Target.

42:27.375 --> 42:28.935
Act two. Pain.

42:29.095 --> 42:30.615
Act three. Kill."

42:36.015 --> 42:38.655
"Billy Taylor, 23rd of June, 1984.
Eight years old."

42:38.815 --> 42:40.175
Jesus.

42:48.175 --> 42:50.575
It's the same. Act one. Act two.

42:51.455 --> 42:52.455
Act three.

43:01.655 --> 43:03.415
Jesus, Danny, you dick.

43:03.575 --> 43:06.095
- What are you doing?
- What have we got?

43:06.255 --> 43:07.175
Close the door.

43:13.855 --> 43:16.655
- Found a trunk.
- These are kids' teeth.

43:16.815 --> 43:19.375
Teeth? We've got hair.

43:19.535 --> 43:23.895
We've got tapes that say
"Act one. Act two. Act three."

43:24.055 --> 43:26.255
- "Connor Tresco."
- Guys.

43:28.255 --> 43:29.855
What is it?

43:31.015 --> 43:31.895
Mark, what is it?
