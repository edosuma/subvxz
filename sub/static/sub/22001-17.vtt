WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.655
ALBA: So if the toaster
won't go down,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.157
it's probably because
it is not plugged in.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.692
Yes, we know how
a toaster works.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.661
Oh, remember to turn the colonel
twice a day

00:27.695 --> 00:28.729
or he will get bedsores.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.264
Gross. Somebody been doing that?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.533
Yes, I have. (sighs)

00:32.566 --> 00:35.336
Okay. Ah. If you run out
of toilet paper...

00:35.369 --> 00:37.405
Then I'll use the bath mat.
Just go, okay?

00:37.438 --> 00:38.839
What are you blathering about?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.174
You know, the list...

00:40.208 --> 00:42.042
of things to get done
while I'm gone.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.177
I didn't even know
you were talking to us.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.178
MICKEY:
You know what? We're good.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.179
Right, guys? We're good.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.880
Go have fun in-in...

00:46.914 --> 00:48.516
Uh... where you going?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.218
I'm going to the city
for a spa weekend.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.553
-Wait, why do you need a break?
-Yeah, you do nothing.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.523
Hey. I am the glue that holds
this house together.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.057
You think it just magically
cleans itself

00:57.091 --> 00:58.526
in the middle of the night?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.061
Oh, no. No, you clean it
in the middle of the night

01:01.095 --> 01:02.296
'cause you're all cranked
on amphetamines.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.564
Well, it gets done, doesn't it?

01:03.597 --> 01:05.065
But then,
I don't sleep all night

01:05.099 --> 01:06.400
'cause you're up there
clomping around

01:06.434 --> 01:07.868
like some kind of hillbilly
Santa Claus.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.970
You know, I just leave this
on the fridge.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.572
MICKEY:
All right, great.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.074
Hey, Alba, do you want to hear
about my dream last night?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.210
Ooh, more than anything,
but, you know,

01:16.244 --> 01:18.546
I am off the clock, Benito.
Tell it to Mickey.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.281
-Oh...
-Do you want to hear about it?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.549
It was a weird one.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.584
-What the hell. Go ahead.
-Okay, so,

01:23.617 --> 01:26.086
-I was on the playground
at recess
-Uh...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.455
and Principal Gibbons
came up to me,

01:27.488 --> 01:29.056
but he wasn't Principal Gibbons,

01:29.089 --> 01:30.391
-he was a werewolf.
-Oh, yeah?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.227
He had the biggest hands
and really long nails.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.163
-Oh.
-And he was really tall and big.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.231
And then the werewolf army came,

01:37.265 --> 01:40.067
and there was, like,
a billion of them.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.069
I was so scared!

01:42.102 --> 01:44.438
And then I shot
the biggest werewolf,

01:44.472 --> 01:48.342
and instead of dying, he turned
into a robot werewolf,

01:48.376 --> 01:50.811
and he's like, (gruff voice)
"Give me candy."

01:50.844 --> 01:52.012
(normal voice)
So I ran to the candy store,

01:52.045 --> 01:53.747
and I got him some candy.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.751
And he ate it so really,
really, really fast.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.154
Then I gave all the werewolves
bubblegum.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.489
Yep. Yep.
A little close, though.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.157
But they were eating it
and they were eating it,

02:03.191 --> 02:04.492
-and it got stuck...
-I can still hear you.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.294
You don't have to get so close.
There we go.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.995
And then I was like,
"That's it!

02:08.028 --> 02:10.431
"All the candy in the whole,
entire world is gone.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.500
Sorry, Mr. Werewolf Robot."

02:12.533 --> 02:14.001
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
He likes candy.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.305
We all have our vices.
No more talking, all right?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.872
But... but don't you want
to hear how it ends?

02:18.906 --> 02:21.275
I don't, I don't. (chuckles)
But only because

02:21.309 --> 02:24.445
I want to marinate
in the suspense. Sweet dreams.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.113
But it's still light out.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.115
My God, how is it only 6:00?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.717
Um, okay, well, you know what?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.253
It'll be dark when you close
your eyes.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.289
Jimmy, we're going out.
Go get ready.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.626
(TV playing indistinctly)

02:38.659 --> 02:40.861
I am ready.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.630
Uh, Sabrina, you're in charge

02:42.663 --> 02:44.064
of Ben and Chip
till we get back.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.466
-Decline.
-Please?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.468
I've been wrangling Ben
all day long.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.536
Sorry. Not my problem.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.304
Come on, just be a team player.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.839
Ladies, please.
I'll be in charge.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.140
(laughs)

02:53.173 --> 02:55.142
Oh, sorry. No.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.645
I wouldn't put you in charge of
changing the colonel's diaper.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.313
What are you talking about?
I'm capable.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.482
Mm, well, you're capable
of asphyxiating yourself

03:01.515 --> 03:03.851
with a phone cord, or, uh...
getting an action figure

03:03.884 --> 03:05.553
stuck up your butt,
I'll give you that.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.154
An act... Why would I have
an action figure

03:07.187 --> 03:08.556
stuck up my butt?

03:08.589 --> 03:10.190
I'm not gonna sit here
and try and speculate

03:10.224 --> 03:11.492
as to why you do
the things you do.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.893
I don't-- I don't do that.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.162
Uh, we'll be back in, like,
two to ten hours.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.998
Yeah? And if you need anything,
Alba left a list on the fridge.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.200
What list?

03:20.234 --> 03:22.202
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.671
(intercom chimes)

03:23.704 --> 03:25.673
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Now approaching our final stop,

03:25.706 --> 03:26.707
Penn Station.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.643
All passengers,
please exit the train.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.184
Penn Station. Last stop.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.353
The train is going out
of service for the weekend.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.022
Everyone please exit the train.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.892
Wh... No. Oh, come on.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.394
Hello?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.061
-Penn Station. Last stop.
-I'm stuck in here!

03:48.095 --> 03:50.564
-The train is going out
of service for the weekend.
-Come on.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.200
(screams) No, no!
Rat!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.803
Rat, rat, rat, rat!
Somebody!

03:58.105 --> 03:59.640
There we go.
There-there's one.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.275
Nah, he's already taking it.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.576
Jimmy, just come on,
get in there.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.211
I don't want to drive around
all night.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.280
What do you want from me, all
right? He's already backing in.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.716
Okay. Cool.
I'll do everything.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.785
Let's not make this
a thing, please. Uh.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.254
-Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
-(horn blares)

04:14.288 --> 04:15.889
Hey, excuse me.
That's-that's my spot.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.691
How come I'm standing
in it then?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.929
MAN (scoffs):
Bro, are you serious?

04:21.962 --> 04:24.097
I know, man, all right? Come on,
I'm trying to take the lady out.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.499
So just help me out, all right?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.267
-How about I give you
a few bucks?
-Oh, boy.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.002
JIMMY:
Oh, God.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.804
-Okay, gentlemen...
-No, you know what, I got it.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.640
-Just-- No. Mick, no, please.
-Everyone back in your...

04:32.673 --> 04:34.174
-Step back, please.
-Oh, God. That's...

04:34.207 --> 04:35.776
All right, look, I didn't know
there was four of you,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.811
but I could still make it
worth your while.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.648
Dude, I'm not doing it,
all right?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.983
I got change here. That's, like,
at least a whole bunch of...

04:43.016 --> 04:45.419
(grunting)

04:45.453 --> 04:48.255
All right, guys.
Hey, fun's over.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.657
Why don't you head home.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.926
Whatever.
You got lucky, bro.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.128
Dude, here's the thing,
I don't believe in luck.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.831
(grunting)

05:02.403 --> 05:05.839
Oh! Did you just hit that guy
in both eyes at the same time?

05:05.873 --> 05:08.342
I raccoon'd him.
It's my signature move.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.444
-I'm Jimmy
-Doug.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.613
-That's a cool name.
-Thanks, man.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.815
(laughs)
I-I got to thank you.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.485
This is the most exciting start
of a date night

05:17.518 --> 05:19.453
-(phone ringing)
-I've had in my entire life.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.121
-Yeah?
-Yeah, oh, yeah.
That-that was real nice.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.390
Excuse me one second.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.459
Yeah? Yes.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.728
What? From where?

05:27.761 --> 05:30.297
All right, yeah,
I'll be right there.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.032
The cops just picked up Ben

05:32.065 --> 05:34.635
riding his bike down the side
of the highway.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.903
I got to go pick him up.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.304
We just got here.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.072
I can give you a lift.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.641
Oh. Is that cool, Mick?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.310
Yeah. Spend your evening
with a-a total stranger.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.012
No problem.
I'll do this by myself.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.484
(engine starting)

05:50.518 --> 05:51.652
Buy me a drink, man?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.753
-Yeah, bro.
-All right.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.555
You can have your spot now!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.495
I woke up in the middle of the
night and there weren't any

06:01.529 --> 06:03.263
adults home,
so I went out to find you.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.898
I can't believe how selfish
she is.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.534
Well, I was around, pal. How
come you didn't look for me?

06:06.567 --> 06:07.968
'Cause you're not an adult.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.605
Oh, hey.
What the hell, man?

06:11.639 --> 06:13.674
-What?
-You said you were gonna
stay home

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
-and watch the kids last night.
-No, I didn't.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.745
-Well, it was implied.
-No, it wasn't.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.947
I had to go pick up Ben
from the police station

06:19.980 --> 06:21.415
because you decided to go out
and leave

06:21.449 --> 06:22.783
two little kids home alone.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.284
Call me a kid one more time,

06:24.317 --> 06:25.886
and I'll box your frickin' ears.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.688
Alba and I ask for just
a little time off,

06:27.721 --> 06:29.189
and this is how you repay us?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.858
Alba was our maid for 17 years.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.359
You talked to Ben
for a few hours,

06:32.392 --> 06:33.461
then put him to bed
in broad daylight.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.962
Hey! No, don't do that.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.564
Don't minimize my work.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.065
You know, I'm starting to think
you don't appreciate

06:38.098 --> 06:39.266
anything I do for you.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.568
You do nothing for me.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.935
And I do nothing for you.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.771
We have a good system,
let's not mess with it.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.474
JIMMY:
Yo, Mick,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.108
-we're going out tonight.
-Yeah? Great.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.276
I'm in.
Where we going?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.044
-You know my buddy, Doug?
-Mm-mm.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.946
Doug, from last night.
Doug, from the fight.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.982
-The total stranger?
-He's, like, the coolest guy

06:55.015 --> 06:56.383
I've ever met, all right?
And you know that I have

06:56.416 --> 06:57.718
a hard time making male friends.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.653
-You do?
-Yeah. They find me
intimidating.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.054
Look, Doug and his girlfriend

07:01.088 --> 07:02.590
are gonna meet us out
for scorpion bowls.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.324
Okay, there you go.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.493
That's what you lead with.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.894
I'm in. 100% in.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.162
Just got to, uh, secure a sitter
for the kids.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.503
SABRINA:
Hey.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.738
-What the hell?
-Oh, you are so sweet

07:17.771 --> 07:19.807
to offer to babysit.
You didn't have to do that.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.142
Mickey, are you insane?
Uncuff me right now.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.745
Tempting, but, um... no.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.514
-Mickey, I'm warning you.
I will...
-Uh-uh. No.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.982
You're not warning anybody.
You brought this on yourself.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.585
I tried to be reasonable,
but you weren't having it.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.086
So guess what?
Here's how it's gonna go down.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.755
Jimmy and I are headed out
for the night

07:34.788 --> 07:37.157
and you're gonna stay here
and watch Ben.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.526
And if you do a really good job,

07:38.559 --> 07:39.993
I might give you a night off
next weekend.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.095
Are you serious? What am I
supposed to do all night?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.964
I don't know. I'm sure you guys
will think of something.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.099
Kid's got a hell of
an imagination. Ooh, I know.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.801
Tell her about that dream
you had last night.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.870
-Okay, but it's pretty gross.
-It is gross.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.672
-I was floating down a river,
-MICKEY: Uh-huh.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.007
but instead of water,
it was diarrhea.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.109
Diarrhea!
Stay tuned. It gets better.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.145
-Uh, you two be good.
-SABRINA: Mickey!

07:58.178 --> 08:01.148
-Want to hear about
the rest of it?
-No!

08:02.415 --> 08:05.285
Hi. We're meeting my buddy,
Doug.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.855
Yes. The rest of your party is
already here. Right this way.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.858
Can't wait to see Doug's chick.
I bet she's a real rocket.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.793
-Settle down.
-That means she's hot.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.828
Yup, I know what it means.
Who talks like that?

08:14.862 --> 08:17.497
I do. I always have. (chuckles)

08:21.168 --> 08:24.304
Jimmy-crack-corn! (laughs)

08:24.337 --> 08:26.306
And Mickey.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.008
My goodness, what a rocket.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.043
Oh, thank you. Jimmy can't stop
talking about you.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.745
I haven't said that much,
so it's...

08:31.779 --> 08:33.146
Yeah, we hit it off big-time.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.015
-This is my boyfriend, Eric.
-Hey.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.516
-Hi.
-Mickey.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.886
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.721
All right, let's get drunk, huh?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.255
No funny business.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.425
Y-You stay on your side
and I will stay on mine.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.695
(mutters)

08:47.728 --> 08:49.262
-(squeaking)
-Hmm? Hmm?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.231
No, you should've brought
your own. No. Hey.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.704
Okay, okay. That-that-that
is very cute, but...

08:56.737 --> 08:58.138
but you are still a rat.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.343
Okay, okay, here you go.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.445
Okay.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.514
Here, l-let's be friends.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.249
Let's be friends.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.119
Okay. Yup, yup. Okay.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.626
-(laughing)
-Are you serious?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.629
That's what he does, always.
Oh, my God.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.264
Everything good, brother?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.565
You're kind of quiet tonight.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.901
Yeah, no, I-I'm fine.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.470
I'm just feeling a little
sleepy, that's all.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.272
You, uh, you want some blow?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.808
Eric, give him the blow.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.044
He's kidding.
There's no cocaine.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.812
(laughs)
You.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.081
That's a dirty trick.
Dirty trick.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.250
I'm sorry, does one of you own
a blue Geo Metro?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.719
Is it leaking oil?
That's all right, it does that.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.055
It's not that.
You better take a look.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.422
Oh, my God. I got it.
Come on, Mick.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.791
Nah, it's cool. I'll hang back.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
-No, come on. I need a hand.
-No, I'm good.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.426
I don't want to get oil on me.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.561
Mick!

09:54.594 --> 09:55.996
-Please.
-All right.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.265
Order another round, okay?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.232
You got it.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.734
-What's the matter with you?
-We're leaving.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.235
W-We're not leaving.
I left my purse there.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.804
Well, I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to get a new one.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.173
-Hey, what is your deal?
-I don't have a deal, all right?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.608
I just feel like Doug
is not who I thought he was.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.077
So we're gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.111
I...

10:11.144 --> 10:13.280
("We Like to Party"
by Vengaboys playing)

10:13.313 --> 10:16.850
JIMMY:
What the...?

10:16.884 --> 10:20.153
She chained the colonel
to your car?

10:21.488 --> 10:23.657
-(Mickey groans)
-(music stops)

10:23.691 --> 10:25.125
BEN:
Hi, Mickey.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.260
MICKEY:
Have you lost your damn mind?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.129
We can go back and forth
like this forever,

10:29.162 --> 10:31.264
but is that really how you want
to spend your remaining days?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.967
Don't you battle me, Sabrina,
you will lose.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.536
Now kindly unchain
the colonel and go home.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.839
-Not until you unlock me.
-Okay, you know what, ladies,

10:38.872 --> 10:40.107
-why don't we just...
-Shut up, Jimmy.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.543
That's it.
I'm over this stupid night.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.813
-Same time.
-Count of three.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.514
One... two... three.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.283
-You!
-I knew it!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.651
Stop screwing around.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.553
You understand me?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.756
One... two... three.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.194
Here we go.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.896
Pleasure doing business
with you.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.865
-Where are you going?
-Back to my scorpion bowl.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.835
-Wait right here.
-Okay.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.907
Sorry about that.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.043
Just had to clear something up
with my bitch niece.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.312
(chuckles)
Oh, where were we?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.914
What are you doing?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.315
I'm having dinner
with my friends.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.152
Everyone, my aforementioned
bitch niece. (chuckles)

11:25.185 --> 11:27.020
Look, I'm not babysitting
those two anymore, okay?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.521
They're your responsibility now.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.824
That's too bad because
I've already begun drinking.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.492
Oh, yeah?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.493
-Uh-huh.
-So have I.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.862
-No, no, no, no, no,
you haven't.
-Mmm.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.830
-Stop it.
-Mmm.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.365
-Let go of that. Stop it.
-Don't grab it.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.332
Let go, Sabrina.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.769
-Give me... Sabrina. Ow!
-(grunting)

11:41.802 --> 11:43.170
Stop!

11:43.203 --> 11:44.337
(gasps)

11:44.371 --> 11:45.873
(Sabrina laughs)

11:47.775 --> 11:50.043
That was a mistake.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.446
(indistinct radio transmission)

11:56.483 --> 11:58.919
(siren chirps)

12:08.929 --> 12:10.798
(straining):
Oh, man, Colonel.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.166
You're really heavy.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.055
(whispering):
Mickey. Mickey.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.756
Why is that woman
staring at us like that?

12:36.790 --> 12:40.560
She's probably deciding which
one of us she wants to maul.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.162
Classic alpha behavior.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.931
(whispering):
So what do we do?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.232
What do we do?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.499
Oh, you don't anything for me

12:46.533 --> 12:48.268
and I don't do anything for you,
remember?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.903
We got a good thing going,
right?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.004
Let's not mess with it.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.739
Mickey, come on. Please.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.009
All right, I'll make you a deal.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.245
You admit just how much
I've sacrificed

12:58.278 --> 12:59.980
for your selfish, ungrateful ass

13:00.013 --> 13:01.949
and then maybe I'll consider
helping you out.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.488
-(stammers, sighs)
-Hmm?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.592
Really? (laughs)

13:12.625 --> 13:14.194
All right, cool.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.429
If you'll excuse me, I've got
to go assert my dominance.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.132
Wh... (sighs)

13:25.873 --> 13:28.008
(clears throat)

13:31.178 --> 13:33.847
(grunts)

13:33.881 --> 13:36.216
Anybody got a match?

13:36.249 --> 13:37.717
WOMAN (groan):
Dang.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.319
WOMAN 2:
Mm, that's not right.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.521
Oh, we are thick as thieves,
Mickey and me.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.023
(laughing)

13:43.056 --> 13:46.359
You know, on paper, it does not
seem like it would work,

13:46.393 --> 13:49.462
probably because
we are both alphas,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.965
but somehow it does

13:51.999 --> 13:56.036
because we respect each other
so much.

13:59.406 --> 14:03.010
Well, rat,
that is the end of it.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.914
No, no, no, don't go,
my friend!

14:09.349 --> 14:11.484
Hello?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.853
Mickey? Sabrina?

14:13.887 --> 14:16.523
Ben? Anybody home?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.659
Finally!

14:19.692 --> 14:21.761

We're already having
a great time, but thanks.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.498
(screaming)

15:34.434 --> 15:36.269
-(rock music playing)
-(engine revving)

15:39.006 --> 15:40.940
(can hisses open)

15:40.974 --> 15:42.442
-(knocking on window)
-DOUG: Jimmy?

15:42.475 --> 15:45.578
There you are. We were wondering
where you went.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.814
-How many beers have you had?
-(engine idling)

15:47.847 --> 15:49.916
Just leave me alone, all right?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.618
All right.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.420
Whatever you want.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.356
I'm not homophobic, you know.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.991
What?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.692
I said I'm not a...

15:59.726 --> 16:01.361
Get in the car.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.932
(music stops)

16:05.965 --> 16:08.135
(door creaks)

16:11.138 --> 16:14.607
I said I'm not homophobic.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.842
I just don't like liars.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.311
I'm sorry I didn't know I needed
to announce that I was gay.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.047
Yeah, then, how was
I supposed to know?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.614
You never told me
you were straight.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.682
Please.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.950
As if I could hide it.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.719
What's going on, man?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.822
You wouldn't understand.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.891
Okay.

16:31.924 --> 16:35.362
-You don't have to talk
about it...
-When I was 13,

16:35.395 --> 16:37.297
I had this friend
named Anderson.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.331
And we'd spend all day
just kicking

16:38.365 --> 16:40.067
the snot out of each other.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.668
Then, at night, we'd go
swimming, and we'd lie

16:41.701 --> 16:45.172
on the docks, and we'd
talk about our dreams.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.375
You know, all the girls
we were gonna suck face with.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.510
Then, one night, Anderson says

16:50.543 --> 16:54.314
maybe we should practice
kissing on each other.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.583
So we spent
all night practicing.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.817
And we got good.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.521
I mean, really good, you know?
All the...

17:01.554 --> 17:04.357
And then, the summer ends,
and Anderson goes home,

17:04.391 --> 17:08.328
and a couple months later,
I find out he's got a boyfriend.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.530
And he's totally homosexual.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.200
And our entire relationship
is based on a lie.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.736
And now, it's happening again.

17:18.371 --> 17:23.543
Jimmy, do you ever consider
maybe you're gay?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.512
Yeah.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.514
I've thought about that a lot.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.517
Unfortunately, I think having
sex with dudes is gross.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.619
-No offense.
-All good.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.688
I think having sex
with women is gross.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.291
It's weird, you know?

17:38.325 --> 17:42.429
We're so different,
but we're alike.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.763
Man.

17:43.796 --> 17:48.868
Look, I'm sorry you had
that really weird experience,

17:48.901 --> 17:51.204
but I'm not Anderson.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.774
And I hope that we can
still be friends.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.576
Cool?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.548
Cool.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.283
Hey.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.585
Do you mind if I masturbate
in front of you?

18:05.618 --> 18:07.053
What?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.121
I'm kidding.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.222
(laughs)

18:09.256 --> 18:11.358
(both laughing)

18:16.329 --> 18:17.830
Oh, man, that's classic.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.803
-Ow!
-Oh, shut up.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.138
-Dolls don't talk.
-Sorry.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.773
SABRINA:
Mickey, a little help here?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.341
You know the magic words.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.643
Okay, fine. I appreciate you.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.512
Oh, yeah?
That's a sweet thing to say.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.413
For what?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.814
For all the stuff you do for us.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.417
Yeah, I-I drink a lot,
so my memory's pretty hazy.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.019
You know? Can you remind me
what it is I do for you?

18:40.052 --> 18:43.089
You live in our mansion and eat
all of our food. (gasps)

18:43.122 --> 18:44.924
You know who else
has great braids?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.259
-Allen Iverson.
-What?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.927
No, no. No. No. Fine. Okay.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.362
Okay.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.698
I appreciate you
because you're our guardian,

18:51.731 --> 18:54.434
and-and you teach us
so much cool stuff

18:54.467 --> 18:56.002
about life or whatever.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.170
I really do, don't I?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.272
-Yeah.
-Yeah. What else?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.540
(sighs)
Okay.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.642
I appreciate you for leaving
your entire life behind,

19:02.675 --> 19:05.044
that I'm sure
was super awesome and exciting

19:05.077 --> 19:06.613
and not at all trashy,

19:06.646 --> 19:09.982
to take care
of three ungrateful brats

19:10.016 --> 19:11.451
whose lives would be doomed

19:11.484 --> 19:13.620
if it weren't for you
being their leader.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.456
Well, that is very big
of you to say.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.024
I appreciate that.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.192
All right, beat it.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.760
I want to play with her
for a while.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.296
(shouts)

19:23.330 --> 19:26.366
-(gasps)
-I'm keeping this one.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.867
-What?
-She earned it.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.968
You know, to be fair.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.970
Pemberton, Molng.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.138
You're free to go.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.240
(laughing):
Oh.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.841
Oh, man,
only a few more seconds,

19:34.874 --> 19:37.143
and you wouldn't have
had to say any of that stuff.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.811
Whatever.
I just want to go home.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.549
Yeah, I should probably clock
back in at the dream factory.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.850
-Huh.
-It's too bad, too.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.385
I was enjoying
the peace and quiet.

19:45.418 --> 19:49.256
Well, hey, if you want
to hang out for a few hours,

19:49.289 --> 19:51.224
I can hold down the fort,
I guess.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.493
-Really?
-Yeah. You know,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.728
at least, until Alba comes back.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.164
Thanks.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.000
What do you think? Is it cool if
I post up here for a few hours?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.236
No, it's not cool. Unless
you've done something wrong,

20:03.270 --> 20:04.504
you have to go.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.105
You-you want me to spit
in your face or something?

20:06.138 --> 20:07.374
Will that do the trick?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.911
Have fun.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.046
I'll see you at home.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.214
Get out of here.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.350
My spot.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.220
(moaning):
Oh, yeah.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.857
Hi, Sabrina.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.693
Hi. Where have you been?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.495
Oh, I've been out
with the colonel.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.566
(car door opens)

20:33.600 --> 20:36.035
(groans)

20:36.068 --> 20:37.937
Good weekend?

20:37.970 --> 20:39.038
Fantastic.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.072
(grunts)

20:40.106 --> 20:43.610
Benny, grab this.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.547
(gasping)

20:47.580 --> 20:49.982
-SABRINA: What the hell?
-BEN: What?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.784
ALBA:
Chip? Uh...

20:52.919 --> 20:54.387
-Ooh.
-Chip?

20:54.421 --> 20:56.423
ALBA:
Chip?!

20:58.024 --> 20:59.058
(gasps)

20:59.091 --> 21:00.560
-BEN: Whoa.
-Oh. Hello.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.329
Thank you for coming.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.396
SABRINA:
Oh, God.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.964
Chip, are you okay?

21:04.997 --> 21:06.265
What happened?

21:06.299 --> 21:08.134
It's nothing. I'm fine.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.636
It was a minor accident.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.304
It could've happened to anyone.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.239
I have it all under control.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.941
What's "Goo"?

21:16.175 --> 21:17.477
Oh.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.146
Uh, I was writing
"Good-bye, cruel world,"

21:20.179 --> 21:22.181
but then, I got sleepy
and decided to take a break.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.250
Ben, go put some ice
in a bucket.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.585
Sabrina, grab some towels.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.853
(Sabrina whimpers)

21:26.886 --> 21:28.588
Okay. Come on, Chip.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.023
Get your fingers,
we go to the hospital.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.659
Where are your fingers?!

21:35.194 --> 21:36.429
MICKEY:
Anybody got a match?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.798
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:41.568 --> 21:43.536
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.838
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.208
(beeps)
911. What's your emergency?

21:49.241 --> 21:51.844
MAN (on phone):
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.647
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.715
Hello?

21:57.850 --> 22:00.820
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:02.489 --> 22:03.623
Rapid response now!

22:03.656 --> 22:06.559
-We can't save everyone.
-Says who?

22:06.593 --> 22:08.828
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
