WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.168
Well, I had a wonderful
time this evening.

00:04.169 --> 00:05.370
Me too.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.905
He really is the lord
of the dance, huh?

00:07.906 --> 00:09.808
Oh, he's not going to kiss
her good night, is he?

00:09.809 --> 00:12.143
Oh, I hope not. His depth
perception is terrible.

00:12.144 --> 00:14.613
He was always getting
his nose in my eye.

00:14.614 --> 00:17.715
Why do you tell me things like
that so close to my bedtime?

00:17.716 --> 00:20.452
Really, I'm fine.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.186
You missed the cornea.

00:26.759 --> 00:28.760
And may I ask
what you are doing?

00:28.761 --> 00:30.228
Oh, I was just, uh,
gonna use the drapes

00:30.229 --> 00:32.830
to make playsuits
for the von Trapp children.

00:32.831 --> 00:34.632
That's your story?

00:34.633 --> 00:36.067
Yeah. I think it holds together.

00:36.068 --> 00:39.638
We'll just see about that.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.073
SABRINA:
A lie detector?

00:41.074 --> 00:43.607
I can't believe you'd think
I'd lie to you.

00:43.608 --> 00:44.976
( whirring, beeping )

00:44.977 --> 00:46.611
Are you open to a bribe?

00:48.881 --> 00:50.081

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.298 --> 01:06.698
I'm really an actress.

01:06.699 --> 01:07.832
Do you want fries with that?

01:11.870 --> 01:12.970
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

01:12.971 --> 01:13.838
And so the assignment

01:13.839 --> 01:15.473
that Mrs. Palotti
has left for you

01:15.474 --> 01:18.876
while she's out sick has you
splitting up into couples

01:18.877 --> 01:21.746
so you can experience
the realities, joys

01:21.747 --> 01:23.681
and responsibilities
of marriage.

01:23.682 --> 01:24.983
Hm. For some reason

01:24.984 --> 01:27.051
there's nothing here
about the corresponding

01:27.052 --> 01:30.088
pain, torture and humiliation.

01:30.089 --> 01:32.423
Ah, everything is so p.c.
these days.

01:32.424 --> 01:36.794
Every day you will receive
a different task.

01:36.795 --> 01:39.730
"Make a budget."
Ha, please.

01:39.731 --> 01:43.535
"Set common goals."
Yeah, I'm sure. Ha, ha.

01:43.536 --> 01:46.170
"Share your feelings." Right.

01:46.171 --> 01:48.106
Share my feelings with
a woman who spends all day

01:48.107 --> 01:49.073
yakking on the phone...

01:49.074 --> 01:51.342
I do.
Yes, Libby.

01:51.343 --> 01:54.980
I was just wondering if you need
help pairing up the couples,

01:54.981 --> 01:57.648
so you're free to focus
on your bitterness.

01:57.649 --> 01:59.016
KRAFT:
Thank you, Libby.

01:59.017 --> 02:01.052
You are a delightful
throwback.

02:02.988 --> 02:05.657
I'm really sorry
we weren't paired up together.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.825
I'm kind of surprised
I got Libby.

02:07.826 --> 02:08.859
Yeah, big surprise.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.527
Right up there
with snow in December.

02:10.529 --> 02:12.696
You don't mind, do you?

02:12.697 --> 02:14.366
No, it's just an assignment.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.934
It's not like
you're really married.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.869
Besides, you're always
working on your car.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.737
You won't even
have time to see her.

02:19.738 --> 02:21.339
I can't work on my car
until I can afford

02:21.340 --> 02:22.540
that heater valve, remember?

02:22.541 --> 02:24.275
My afternoons
are totally free.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.443
Oh, well, it's never too soon

02:25.444 --> 02:27.078
to start preparing
for your SATs.

02:27.079 --> 02:29.647
You're always looking
out for me, Sabrina.

02:29.648 --> 02:31.849
I love it when you do that.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.352
And it's even more fun
now that it's so wrong.

02:36.621 --> 02:39.490
In the future when you'd like
to speak with my husband,

02:39.491 --> 02:42.427
you go through me.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.896
Harvey, darling, wait!

02:44.897 --> 02:46.764
It's just an assignment.
Make-believe.

02:46.765 --> 02:48.266
You're not really married.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.902
Hi, honey, I'm home.

02:52.838 --> 02:55.774
Why won't you tell me
what you and Willard talk about?

02:55.775 --> 02:58.776
Because it's none
of your business.

02:58.777 --> 03:00.978
He's tattooed my name
to his arm, hasn't he?

03:00.979 --> 03:02.379
No, he hasn't.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.582
Oh, so you've seen his arms.

03:07.619 --> 03:09.054
What's the matter with you?

03:09.055 --> 03:11.389
Somebody get their chocolate
in your peanut butter?

03:11.390 --> 03:13.290
No.
Libby's trying to steal Harvey.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.493
Oh. You know, Sabrina,
no one can be stolen

03:15.494 --> 03:16.795
unless they want to be.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.297
Oh, so now Willard
wanted to be stolen.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.499
I trust Harvey.
It's Libby I don't trust.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.635
As the saying goes,
it takes two to tango.

03:23.636 --> 03:26.271
Zelda, we're not talking
about dancing here.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.873
We've got two people-- Oh.

03:28.874 --> 03:30.675
Please continue.

03:30.676 --> 03:33.043
Oh, you poor,
naive little thing.

03:33.044 --> 03:35.980
So innocent to the ways of love.

03:35.981 --> 03:37.048
I told you, I trust Harvey.

03:37.049 --> 03:38.482
It doesn't matter
what Libby does,

03:38.483 --> 03:40.117
Harvey would never cheat on me.

03:40.118 --> 03:42.987
That's what I thought when
I was dating Madame Curie.

03:42.988 --> 03:45.757
Marie started spending a lot
of time in the lab with Pierre.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.525
They told me
it was an experiment,

03:47.526 --> 03:48.726
but I knew better.

03:48.727 --> 03:51.395
She kept saying "the phrase."

03:51.396 --> 03:53.965
"Stay away from me
or I'll call the police"?

03:53.966 --> 03:55.700
No. "Don't you trust me?"

03:55.701 --> 03:56.867
You knew she was cheating on you

03:56.868 --> 03:59.003
because she said,
"Don't you trust me?"

03:59.004 --> 04:01.473
That, and I hired a detective
from the Other Realm

04:01.474 --> 04:05.043
and got some pictures of them
sharing more than radiation.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.045
I'm not hiring a detective
to spy on Harvey.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.013
For the last time,
I trust him.

04:09.014 --> 04:11.683
Uh-huh.
Do you even know where he is?

04:11.684 --> 04:13.551
Yes. He's at home.

04:13.552 --> 04:14.719
I'll prove it to you.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.088
( beeps )

04:18.857 --> 04:20.124
HARVEY:
<i>Hello.</i>

04:20.125 --> 04:22.694
Hello, Harvey.
I knew you'd be home.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.261
Oh, hi, Sabrina.

04:24.262 --> 04:25.363
Hi, Sabrina.

04:25.364 --> 04:27.065
Libby?
What's Libby doing there?

04:27.066 --> 04:29.100
SALEM:
Proving my point.

04:29.101 --> 04:31.503
She came over and brought me
some homemade cookies.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.771
I don't remember that being
part of the assignment.

04:33.772 --> 04:35.673
Goodbye, Sabrina.
I don't wanna keep you

04:35.674 --> 04:38.042
from your ice cream
and romance novel.

04:39.344 --> 04:41.379
Do you still have
that detective's number?

04:41.380 --> 04:43.448
You've got ice cream?

04:50.589 --> 04:52.356
BOGART ( narrating ):
<i>She blew into my office</i>

04:52.357 --> 04:54.692
<i>like a cool breeze</i>
<i>on a hot summer day.</i>

04:54.693 --> 04:55.894
Who said that?

04:55.895 --> 04:57.862
<i>But trouble clung to her</i>

04:57.863 --> 04:59.964
<i>like a cotton sheet</i>
<i>to a wet dog.</i>

04:59.965 --> 05:01.733
Okay, I get it.

05:01.734 --> 05:05.035
Is there anyone here
who can help me?

05:05.036 --> 05:08.006
Depends on what kind of help
you're looking for, sweetheart.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.942
Roland!
Sabrina. You found me.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.878
What happened to your
job as an equalizer?

05:13.879 --> 05:15.613
Oh, they went totally digital.

05:15.614 --> 05:18.149
So let me guess:

05:18.150 --> 05:19.817
trouble with farm boy?

05:19.818 --> 05:21.251
Stepping out on you, huh?

05:21.252 --> 05:24.556
No. Maybe.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.958
Hundred bucks a day
plus expenses.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.527
Sure, I make that
a night babysitting.

05:29.528 --> 05:31.462
I don't
have that kind of money.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.765
This ain't no charity ward,
baby.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.267
The fog machine,
the voice-over guy,

05:36.268 --> 05:37.668
they all cost money.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.673
Forget it.
This was a bad idea.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.842
Oh, wait, I just remembered.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.309
I'm running a special
this month.

05:49.247 --> 05:51.816
"An hour of surveillance
for one minute of hand-holding."

05:51.817 --> 05:54.018
Thanks. I'll call you
if I ever stop screaming.

05:54.019 --> 05:56.087
BOGART:
<i>Like peanut butter</i>
<i>to the roof of your--</i>

05:56.088 --> 05:57.588
Knock it off.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.528
Hey, Sabrina.
Sorry about yesterday.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.630
That's okay. Now that Libby's
been to your house,

06:05.631 --> 06:07.698
I guess the worst is over.

06:07.699 --> 06:10.167
Wow, Libby, did you do all this?

06:10.168 --> 06:11.402
Me and Locker World.

06:11.403 --> 06:12.537
There are separate places

06:12.538 --> 06:15.740
for your books,
for your lunch,

06:15.741 --> 06:18.676
and an odor-proof, lead-lined
compartment for your gym shoes.

06:18.677 --> 06:20.511
Remember,
I gave you a roach motel.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.646
I just wanted to make sure

06:21.647 --> 06:24.415
I did a good job
on today's assignment.

06:24.416 --> 06:27.952
"Wives, do something nice
for your husbands."

06:27.953 --> 06:30.254
For a change,
not just take, take, take.

06:30.255 --> 06:31.455
Excellent work, Libby.

06:31.456 --> 06:33.792
I'll see you at lunch, Harvey.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.894
I packed us something special.

06:36.895 --> 06:38.496
You're having lunch
with her now?

06:38.497 --> 06:40.565
Thanks for being
so understanding.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.799
You're the best.

06:44.269 --> 06:47.939
Hey.
My kiss.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.913
( dial tone, beeping )

06:55.914 --> 06:57.181
Hello, Roland?

06:57.983 --> 06:59.551
I knew you'd call back.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.385
Dames are so predictable.

07:01.386 --> 07:03.621
I've gotta know what's going on
between Harvey and Libby.

07:03.622 --> 07:05.956
Can you start right away?

07:05.957 --> 07:08.426
As soon as we settle our fee.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.662
One minute, payable immediately.

07:11.663 --> 07:14.164
Ooh-ooh.

07:14.165 --> 07:17.068
One hippopotamus.
Two hippopotamus.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.435
Three hippopotamus.

07:18.436 --> 07:19.803
( Zelda giggling )

07:19.804 --> 07:24.375
Oh, Willard,
that's hilarious.

07:24.376 --> 07:27.445
Willard, do me a favor.
Put down the phone.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.947
Oh, you're too much.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.018
( air horn honks )

07:35.987 --> 07:37.321
ROLAND:
Pst.

07:37.322 --> 07:40.190
I bet you didn't even
recognize me, huh?

07:40.191 --> 07:41.459
What are you supposed to be?

07:41.460 --> 07:42.760
An exchange student.

07:42.761 --> 07:45.162
Pretend like you don't know me.

07:45.163 --> 07:48.132
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
It's my fantasy.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.003
Hello, fellow students.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.738
Aren't you Sabrina's cousin?

07:53.739 --> 07:55.873
Guess again, farm boy.

07:55.874 --> 07:58.509
So you two are dating?

07:58.510 --> 08:00.377
GORDIE:
Well?

08:00.378 --> 08:01.412
Well, what?

08:01.413 --> 08:03.047
Our assignment.

08:03.048 --> 08:05.349
"Uh, wives, prepare a special
treat for your husbands,

08:05.350 --> 08:07.018
"and try not to bring
it up resentfully

08:07.019 --> 08:08.820
years later during an argument."

08:08.821 --> 08:12.090
Right.
Oh, I got you, uh, a fruit cup.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.924
How many times
do I have to tell you?

08:13.925 --> 08:15.459
I'm not Sabrina's cousin.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.194
I'm from Iceland.

08:17.195 --> 08:18.829
My name is Bjorn.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.900
Okay, Bjorn, and how many times
do I have to tell you:

08:21.901 --> 08:24.168
Libby's not my girlfriend.
Sabrina is.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.709
What did you find out?

08:31.710 --> 08:35.379
Forget it. Move on.
You and Harvey are history.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.114
What? I can't believe it.

08:37.115 --> 08:39.448
Well, that's just
my preliminary report.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.385
If you need more details:

08:44.022 --> 08:44.955
Great lunch, Libby.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.827
You're the best.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.798
That's my kiss.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.466
You just kissed Libby.

08:55.467 --> 08:56.467
Just on the cheek.

08:56.468 --> 08:57.735
Then you admit it?

08:57.736 --> 08:58.936
What's wrong, Sabrina?

08:58.937 --> 09:00.271
Don't you trust me?

09:00.272 --> 09:02.473
What did you say?

09:02.474 --> 09:04.509
Don't you trust me?

09:06.345 --> 09:08.613
Find out everything.
I want pictures. I want video.

09:08.614 --> 09:09.814
Money's no object.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.448
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

09:15.287 --> 09:17.288
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

09:17.289 --> 09:21.358
Tomorrow, 8:00.
See you then, Willard.

09:23.428 --> 09:25.195
I hope you've
learned your lesson.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.798
What lesson?

09:26.799 --> 09:29.567
Is Willard trying to get you
to teach me a lesson?

09:29.568 --> 09:31.335
Is that what he's doing?

09:31.336 --> 09:32.970
Hilda, you need
to find a therapist,

09:32.971 --> 09:35.473
one who doesn't refer to you
as caller number two.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.308
He better not be taking
you to the Stockyard,

09:37.309 --> 09:39.243
because that was
our special place.

09:39.244 --> 09:42.713
I'm not telling you anything.

09:42.714 --> 09:45.649
But I might,
provided there's tuna.

09:45.650 --> 09:47.084
( cackling )

09:48.454 --> 09:49.587
Hey, Sabrina,
how's it going?

09:49.588 --> 09:51.922
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.791
Oh, so now you're hiding
things from me?

09:53.792 --> 09:55.759
What am I hiding from you?
How should I know?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.394
How should you know what?
Oh, perfect.

09:57.395 --> 09:59.463
Pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about.

09:59.464 --> 10:00.564
Who's pretending?

10:02.501 --> 10:03.801
Sorry.

10:03.802 --> 10:05.903
I had to get my camera.
So glad you're here.

10:05.904 --> 10:08.406
Harvey's acting totally weird.

10:08.407 --> 10:09.673
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

10:13.144 --> 10:15.279
( choking )

10:19.318 --> 10:20.551
( shutter clicks )

10:44.276 --> 10:46.110
( cheering )

11:11.203 --> 11:13.304
( shutter clicks )

11:16.007 --> 11:19.010
It ain't pretty,
but the truth never is.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.811
I never knew betrayal
came wallet-sized.

11:24.849 --> 11:26.417
Goodbye, farm boy.

11:26.418 --> 11:28.919
Hello, Roland.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.587
Harvey Kinkle,
you've got a lot

11:30.588 --> 11:31.922
of explaining to do.

11:31.923 --> 11:33.224
About what?
Oh!

11:33.225 --> 11:35.926
You know about what.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.794
Sabrina, I hate this game.

11:37.795 --> 11:39.163
It makes my head hurt.

11:39.164 --> 11:40.130
You and Libby.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.799
You were all over her
in the cafeteria.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.200
You were hugging in the hallway.

11:43.201 --> 11:45.469
What are you talking about?

11:45.470 --> 11:47.538
I thought you trusted me.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.740
But can't we talk
about this?

11:49.741 --> 11:51.075
I have to meet Libby.

11:51.076 --> 11:53.010
It's our anniversary
tonight.

11:53.011 --> 11:54.912
Oh, if you're really supposed
to be her husband

11:54.913 --> 11:56.747
shouldn't you forget
your anniversary?

11:58.450 --> 12:00.384
What do you mean
you don't know where they are?

12:00.385 --> 12:03.120
What kind of mother are you?
Hello?

12:03.121 --> 12:05.622
Mrs. Kinkle? Hello?

12:05.623 --> 12:07.858
I found out
where they're going.

12:07.859 --> 12:09.694
Someplace called "the knoll."

12:09.695 --> 12:10.861
They're going to the knoll?

12:10.862 --> 12:13.030
But that's a big make out--
Come on!

12:16.168 --> 12:17.968
( doorbell rings )

12:17.969 --> 12:19.003
Quick, blend in.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.574
Happy anniversary.

12:23.575 --> 12:24.642
Is that your car?

12:24.643 --> 12:27.144
Uh, it will be in 53 payments.

12:27.145 --> 12:28.980
What a funny-looking lamp.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.314
Yeah, uh, fascinating.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.950
Why don't we talk about it
on the way to the knoll?

12:32.951 --> 12:35.219
It will break my mother's heart.
Let's go!

12:38.790 --> 12:40.424
I'm leaving.

12:40.425 --> 12:41.792
Oh, is your date tonight?

12:41.793 --> 12:44.561
Oh. I'd completely forgotten.

12:44.562 --> 12:45.896
Nothing more pathetic

12:45.897 --> 12:47.731
than a woman who clings
to the past.

12:47.732 --> 12:51.335
Unless it's one who sits around
in a bathrobe and fuzzy slippers

12:51.336 --> 12:52.803
talking to her cat.

12:52.804 --> 12:54.204
( both laughing )

12:55.407 --> 12:57.374
Ooh, comfy.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.343
Well, I'm glad to see

12:59.344 --> 13:01.178
you've made peace
with my dating Willard.

13:01.179 --> 13:02.979
You have fun now.

13:02.980 --> 13:05.249
She's gone.
Let's tail her.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.416
Change me back.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.118
No amount of tuna is worth

13:08.119 --> 13:11.789
this olfactory nightmare,
P-yew.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.999
Thanks for driving, Libby.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.868
I'm still waiting for
that heater valve for my car.

13:24.869 --> 13:27.404
Surprise.

13:27.405 --> 13:29.573
This isn't Bowl-A-Rama.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.808
I know.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.677
I thought we should
go someplace fun

13:32.678 --> 13:34.177
for our anniversary.

13:34.178 --> 13:37.548
Me too, that's why
we were going bowling.

13:37.549 --> 13:41.118
Harvey, so many
rough edges to grind.

13:43.755 --> 13:45.957
Chocolate-covered
strawberry?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.369
Wow, so this is the knoll.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.937
I can't believe
I'm really here.

13:59.938 --> 14:01.805
Ahem, again.

14:01.806 --> 14:04.875
Hey, do you think that's
Libby's mom's car over there?

14:04.876 --> 14:07.311
Uh, don't worry.
Nobody can see us.

14:07.312 --> 14:09.714
Which reminds me,
I'm gonna need documentation.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.081
Do you have a camera on you?

14:14.253 --> 14:15.319
Ah.

14:17.923 --> 14:21.025
Oh, my, how did you
ever find this place?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.593
The quarterback
on the football team

14:22.594 --> 14:24.662
told me about it
during detention.

14:24.663 --> 14:28.933
Here, feast your eyes
on this, my lady fair.

14:31.536 --> 14:34.738
Oh, look at all those stars.

14:34.739 --> 14:38.609
You were right.
I can't believe they're here.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.344
Don't make me watch.

14:40.345 --> 14:43.013
I'll have to scratch out
my own eyes.

14:43.014 --> 14:44.548
It will be fun.
Come on.

14:44.549 --> 14:46.884
Like a horror film, only gorier.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.285
Look, there is no way that--

14:48.286 --> 14:51.121
Oh, is that real butter?

14:53.525 --> 14:55.025
Sorry the Stockyards
were closed,

14:55.026 --> 14:57.394
but it's-- It's kind of pretty
here too, isn't it?

14:57.395 --> 14:59.396
Oh, yes.
Yeah.

14:59.397 --> 15:02.399
Maybe, uh, a little music
to set the mood.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.067
( radio playing
"Wives and Lovers" )

15:04.068 --> 15:06.036
¶ Hey, little girl ¶

15:06.037 --> 15:10.341
¶ Fix your hair
Do your makeup ¶

15:10.342 --> 15:12.576
What's with all
these stupid trees?

15:12.577 --> 15:13.911
You can't see anyone else.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.412
That's the point.

15:15.413 --> 15:17.748
Sabrina, I think we have
a serious problem.

15:17.749 --> 15:19.082
You see Harvey and Libby?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.985
Not with them.
With us.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.619
Our marriage is on the rocks.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.354
I just keep giving
and giving--

15:25.824 --> 15:28.125
The cops.
My dad's gonna kill me.

15:28.126 --> 15:30.628
Is there a problem, officer?

15:30.629 --> 15:32.429
Listen, punk,

15:32.430 --> 15:35.599
I need to see some ID
and registration now,

15:35.600 --> 15:37.767
or it's the business end
of big Ed here.

15:40.838 --> 15:43.139
What are you waiting for?
They're over there.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.141
I'm trying.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.408
I'm gonna need you

15:45.409 --> 15:46.710
to step out of the car, miss.

15:51.115 --> 15:52.916
Uh, what about me?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.018
Face forward.

15:55.019 --> 15:57.621
Both hands on the wheel.

15:57.622 --> 15:59.856
Uh-huh,
and Orionis, of course,

15:59.857 --> 16:01.325
is your typical
M-class star,

16:01.326 --> 16:04.227
known for its presence
of metallic oxide molecules.

16:04.228 --> 16:05.295
ZELDA:
Mm-hm.

16:05.296 --> 16:07.931
Notably, those with
titanium oxide.

16:07.932 --> 16:11.869
Let's go. I've never been
so bored in my entire life,

16:11.870 --> 16:14.438
and I stare up into space
18 hours a day.

16:14.439 --> 16:16.573
Come on.
Let's say five more minutes.

16:16.574 --> 16:18.575
This can't be all
they talk about.

16:18.576 --> 16:20.911
Oh, I know.
Okay.

16:20.912 --> 16:24.315
Let's try and name all
the moons of Jupiter by mass.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.649
Oh, boy.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.683
Europa.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.055
So you pop in,
take a quick look-see,

16:31.056 --> 16:33.590
dump Harvey,
cry on my shoulder,

16:33.591 --> 16:35.126
and we live happily ever after.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.194
Plus, I have some
long-term plans.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.964
It's true. I can't believe
they're really here.

16:39.965 --> 16:43.300
Yep.
I wouldn't lie to you.

16:43.301 --> 16:44.501
I can't do it.

16:44.502 --> 16:46.937
I thought I could,
but I can't.

16:46.938 --> 16:49.540
So I guess this is gonna
take some tough love.

16:56.814 --> 16:59.015
Metis, Ganymede,

16:59.016 --> 17:00.484
and don't help me,

17:00.485 --> 17:01.652
Callisto.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.120
( both laughing )

17:03.121 --> 17:05.422
Oh, excellent.
Oh, thank you.

17:05.423 --> 17:09.358
Okay. Now by carbon content.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.694
Can't...stay awake.

17:11.695 --> 17:13.896
Too boring.

17:13.897 --> 17:16.300
( snoring )

17:16.300 --> 17:18.035
Now that we're all alone,
is there anything

17:18.036 --> 17:19.904
you'd like to say to me?

17:19.905 --> 17:21.438
Yeah. If you get any closer,

17:21.439 --> 17:22.906
I'm gonna fall
out of the car.

17:22.906 --> 17:25.108
Then you better hold
on to something.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.744
You point it, I break it.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.913
Libby, cut it out.
I've got a girlfriend.

17:29.914 --> 17:32.849
But the other day at school
you kissed me.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.818
I know. It was weird.

17:34.819 --> 17:36.553
I don't even know
why I did it.

17:36.554 --> 17:38.688
I bet I do.

17:39.790 --> 17:40.924
Sabrina's my girlfriend.

17:40.925 --> 17:42.326
I'm not gonna cheat on her.

17:42.327 --> 17:43.694
I won't tell if you won't.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.162
"No" means "no," Libby.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.864
I think you should
take me home now.

17:47.865 --> 17:49.733
But I bought you dinner.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.468
Sabrina!

17:51.469 --> 17:52.603
This is the last straw.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.071
I don't care
how it affects my final grade,

17:55.072 --> 17:56.574
I want a divorce.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.707
Sabrina?

17:57.708 --> 17:58.876
Bjorn?

17:58.877 --> 18:00.811
Now you're spying on me?

18:00.812 --> 18:03.013
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

18:03.014 --> 18:04.681
Harvey, wait!

18:07.285 --> 18:08.652
( screams )

18:10.188 --> 18:11.955
( snoring )

18:13.658 --> 18:15.225
Hilda?

18:15.226 --> 18:16.393
Hilda.

18:16.394 --> 18:17.794
ZELDA:
Oh. I can't believe

18:17.795 --> 18:20.564
you were so jealous
that you had to spy on us.

18:20.565 --> 18:23.033
Oh, I have never
been so mad at you

18:23.034 --> 18:24.033
in my entire life.

18:24.034 --> 18:25.469
Hilda, that's not true.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.405
Remember when we were kids
and I broke your collarbone?

18:28.406 --> 18:30.707
Oh, Zelda, wait.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.476
Wow.

18:32.477 --> 18:34.578
Sisters fighting over me.

18:34.579 --> 18:39.216
Hey, when you got it,
you got it.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.351
SABRINA:
Harvey.

18:42.153 --> 18:43.254
Sabrina!

18:43.255 --> 18:44.688
Zelda!

18:51.763 --> 18:53.097
None of this would have happened

18:53.098 --> 18:56.367
if you had learned to control
your primitive urges,

18:56.368 --> 18:59.403
if all of you hadn't
been overcome with jealousy.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.605
I wasn't jealous.
I was hungry.

19:01.606 --> 19:03.807
I was jealous
and I was hungry.

19:03.808 --> 19:06.142
Once again, I'm the only
mature responsible one

19:06.143 --> 19:07.544
in the entire group.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.413
That must make you all
incredibly jealous.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.548
Thanks for the lecture, toots,
but I got to run.

19:11.549 --> 19:13.583
So, uh, I'll be collecting
the rest of my fee--

19:13.584 --> 19:16.420
I'm not paying you any more.
This was all your fault.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.455
Oh, yeah?
Well, who came to whose office?

19:18.456 --> 19:19.923
ZELDA:
You were both at fault,

19:19.924 --> 19:21.658
but if it'll
get rid of you any faster,

19:21.659 --> 19:23.360
I will cover the rest
of your fee.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.164
There.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.465
Paid in full.

19:28.466 --> 19:31.602
Uh, I usually get
time and a half after 5.

19:31.603 --> 19:32.669
It's a union thing.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.337
Out.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.707
I also do general contracting.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.610
GORDIE:
So to sum it up,

19:40.611 --> 19:43.146
our marriage was a complete
and total failure.

19:43.147 --> 19:44.147
Thank you.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.482
KRAFT:
Beautiful.

19:45.483 --> 19:46.282
Come on.

19:46.283 --> 19:47.318
Beautiful.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.386
Oh, the memories.

19:49.387 --> 19:51.322
You know, it is so great

19:51.323 --> 19:54.424
to see a young couple
on the right track.

19:54.425 --> 19:56.927
A.

19:56.928 --> 19:59.062
Gordie, I just want
to apologize.

19:59.063 --> 20:00.296
You were a great husband,

20:00.297 --> 20:02.499
and I'm sorry that
I treated you so badly.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.034
Are you kidding?

20:04.035 --> 20:06.736
You're a genius. We're the only
two who passed. Thanks.

20:06.737 --> 20:07.671
( bell ringing )

20:07.672 --> 20:08.772
No running.

20:08.773 --> 20:11.642
Hey, can you believe
we got an A?

20:15.013 --> 20:16.780
I know you're mad,
but can't you be the kind

20:16.781 --> 20:18.415
of mad where you
still talk to me?

20:18.416 --> 20:20.417
I'm not mad.
I'm disappointed.

20:20.418 --> 20:23.820
The kind of disappointed
where you still talk to me?

20:23.821 --> 20:25.422
You know,
my behavior kind of shows

20:25.423 --> 20:26.723
how much I care about you

20:26.724 --> 20:30.026
in some weird, twisted,
demented, stalker kind of way.

20:30.027 --> 20:31.962
I know you care.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.363
I just want you
to trust me,

20:33.364 --> 20:35.832
and believe me when I say
you're the only girl for me.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.400
I do. Now.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.937
Not that I didn't before,
because I did, sort of,

20:39.938 --> 20:41.805
but not in the same way
I do now.

20:41.806 --> 20:43.573
Let me know if I make a point.

20:43.574 --> 20:45.241
What's this?
You don't know?

20:45.242 --> 20:48.345
The guy at the junkyard
said it was a heater valve.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.946
I knew he was
gonna rip me off.

20:49.947 --> 20:51.348
This is so great.

20:51.349 --> 20:52.949
This is just the kind
of thing that--

20:52.950 --> 20:54.084
Libby would do.

20:54.085 --> 20:55.452
No. This is just
the kind of thing

20:55.453 --> 20:57.520
that only Sabrina would do.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.458
I love it when you do that.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.269
It was really nice of Gordie
to let us use his car.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.837
He had no choice.

21:13.838 --> 21:15.538
It was part of our
divorce agreement.

21:15.539 --> 21:17.241
He got the house.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.744
Libby and I are only
talking through our lawyers.

21:20.745 --> 21:22.846
You know, at first
I thought this assignment

21:22.847 --> 21:24.248
was kind of stupid,

21:24.249 --> 21:27.817
but then it made me realize
how hard relationships can be.

21:27.818 --> 21:29.620
I know.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.921
But I'm sure it gets easier
as you get older.

21:31.922 --> 21:33.690
( horn honks )

21:33.691 --> 21:35.492
I hope they don't
take the freeway.

21:35.493 --> 21:36.694
Aah!

21:37.305 --> 21:43.619
