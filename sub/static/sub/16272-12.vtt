- Of course.

He won't answer his phone.
I don't know what to tell Alan.

00:10.483 --> 00:11.983
Plus, our wedding caterer
keeps calling

00:12.018 --> 00:13.618

I panicked.

00:13.653 --> 00:14.886
I told her just double them.

00:14.921 --> 00:17.955
Shh. Take the wine.
Yeah, be less crazy.

00:17.991 --> 00:20.992
<i>Or drink a whole lot of wine
and get real crazy!</i>

00:21.027 --> 00:23.928
Linda, you want to get crazy?
I'll get crazy!

00:23.963 --> 00:25.530
Again I am so sorry
about this Zorn thing.

00:25.565 --> 00:27.432
[sighs]
Honestly, it's fine.

00:27.467 --> 00:29.701
I have no feelings for Zorn,
which is why

00:29.736 --> 00:31.436
this whole Craig thing
is so crazy.

00:31.471 --> 00:33.504
"Zorn and I were meant
to be together"?

00:33.540 --> 00:35.206
If that were true,
we'd still be married,

00:35.241 --> 00:37.341
and I wouldn't owe him
ten chickens a month.

00:37.377 --> 00:40.679
- Zephyrian alimony is so weird.
- I just don't know what to do.

00:40.714 --> 00:41.779
<i>I'll tell you what you're gonna do.</i>

00:41.815 --> 00:44.749
You're gonna come with me, and
we're gonna go find your fiancé

00:44.784 --> 00:47.018
together, if that's what you
really definitely want to do.

00:47.053 --> 00:48.553
Like, 100% for sure.

00:48.588 --> 00:50.455
- How are you going to do that?
- Edie, sweetie,

00:50.490 --> 00:51.956
I'm a world-class hunter, all right.

00:51.991 --> 00:53.758
Now, of course, I've never
taken my prey alive,

00:53.793 --> 00:56.558
- but how different can it be, right?
- Hey, I'll come, too.

00:56.593 --> 00:57.528
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Um...

00:57.564 --> 00:59.130
Chasing a guy who doesn't
want to be found

00:59.165 --> 01:01.099
is not my ideal way to
get out of town, but hey,

01:01.134 --> 01:04.836
- a vacation's a vacation. I'll drive.
- Oh, yeah!

01:04.870 --> 01:07.171
- All right. I guess I need all the help I can get.
- Hey, Linda, babe,

01:07.207 --> 01:09.440

will fit in your car?

01:09.476 --> 01:11.409

to squeeze into, so...

01:11.444 --> 01:13.611
Oh, absolutely not.

01:13.646 --> 01:15.046

That's such a handy trick
to have. I wonder why I don't

17:56.171 --> 17:57.838
use it more often, you know?
[chuckles]

17:57.873 --> 18:01.572
Oh, that's right.
'Cause I start lactating blood.

18:02.076 --> 18:03.410
[whistle blows]

18:03.675 --> 18:05.883
<i>QUARTERBACK: Hut! Hut!</i>

18:05.918 --> 18:07.333
[players grunting]

18:07.368 --> 18:09.396
Hey, Linda!
We're over here!

18:09.432 --> 18:12.600
ZORN: What? Linda came?
Uh, quick, guys,

18:12.635 --> 18:15.035
think of a good reason I can
whip out my two penises.

18:15.071 --> 18:16.537
That's usually
a top shelf icebreaker.

18:16.572 --> 18:18.339
[whistle blows]
Well, I invited her.

18:18.374 --> 18:20.908
I told her all the confusion
on the trip was my fault.

18:20.943 --> 18:22.910
Hey, Linda, uh,
I'm glad you could come.

18:22.945 --> 18:24.879
Edie told you
it was all her fault, right?

18:24.914 --> 18:27.314
She did, but I'm still
a little mad at you.

18:27.350 --> 18:29.083
I am so, so sorry Linda.

18:29.118 --> 18:31.886
That's not how I wanted
our first road trip to go.

18:31.921 --> 18:34.054
I wanted it to be
sweet and special,

18:34.090 --> 18:35.423
and to include sex in at least

18:35.424 --> 18:38.192
six different rest areas
and/or jetted tubs.

18:38.227 --> 18:42.263
I-I promise you that I won't
ever take you for granted again.

18:42.298 --> 18:45.099
And as a symbol of that promise,
well, here, I got you these.

18:45.134 --> 18:49.703
[gasps] Oh, Zorn.
Oh, they're beautiful!

18:49.739 --> 18:50.971
Thank you.

18:51.007 --> 18:53.974
All right, I forgive you.

18:54.010 --> 18:55.409
Plus, my apartment's
being fumigated,

18:55.444 --> 18:57.378
so I need a place
to stay tonight.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.146
[whispering]:
Zorn, aren't those the cursed

18:59.182 --> 19:00.800
Crystals of Cuwathahara?

19:00.835 --> 19:04.518
- Yes. But her parents are already dead.
- Oh.

19:04.554 --> 19:06.420
Oh! Come on, Whitaker!

19:06.455 --> 19:08.355
- Son of Zorn!
- Hey.

19:08.391 --> 19:10.357
- Come here!
- Oh!

19:10.393 --> 19:11.525
<i>ALAN: Hey, coach, what do you need?</i>

19:11.561 --> 19:13.093
- What do I need?
- Yeah.

19:13.129 --> 19:14.728
Maybe a little validation
in my life,

19:14.764 --> 19:16.397
considering the Booster Club
didn't even tell anybody

19:16.432 --> 19:17.598
that we were having a game!

19:17.633 --> 19:20.034
But I'll take
a field goal and a win.

19:20.069 --> 19:22.369
- I can... You want me to kick the field goal?
- Yeah!

19:22.405 --> 19:23.504
- Right now?
- Right now!

19:23.539 --> 19:25.339
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm so proud of you!

19:25.374 --> 19:27.908
<i>EDIE: Here we go!
This is so exciting!</i>

19:27.944 --> 19:30.110
Let's go, Alan!
That's our boy!

19:30.146 --> 19:31.512
ZORN [chanting]:
Fire it up!

19:31.547 --> 19:33.614
Take control!

19:33.649 --> 19:35.516
Domination!

19:35.551 --> 19:39.344
Grind the bones of your enemies
to dust and ravage their elders!

19:40.189 --> 19:42.122
<i>PLAYERS: Break!</i>

19:42.158 --> 19:44.124
<i>MARCUS [chanting]:
Son of Zorn! Son of Zorn!</i>

19:44.160 --> 19:47.194
<i>Son of Zorn!
Come on, baby!</i>

19:51.033 --> 19:51.999
Hut!

19:55.972 --> 19:58.372
- [crowd gasps] Ooh!
- Oh!

19:58.407 --> 19:59.607
[player groans]

19:59.642 --> 20:01.041
<i>[whistle blows]
REFEREE: Need a medic!</i>

20:01.077 --> 20:02.409
<i>ZORN: Woo-hoo!
[laughs]</i>

20:02.445 --> 20:04.712
Way to go, Son of Zorn!

20:04.747 --> 20:07.314
Oh, man, you totally
killed that kid!

20:07.350 --> 20:09.416
I heard so many bones break!

20:09.452 --> 20:11.418
Wha... I...
[player sobbing]

20:11.454 --> 20:14.051
I don't think I understand
the rules of this game.

20:14.724 --> 20:17.925
- Hey...
- Aw, look at my handsome little failure.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.126
[sighs]

20:19.161 --> 20:24.164
I lost the game, lost my new
friends and Layla, so I'm the worst.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.666
Hey, I don't know you that well,

20:25.701 --> 20:27.768
but I'm pretty sure
you're not the worst.

20:27.803 --> 20:29.803
But like I said, I don't
know you that well.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.807
Well, you know what? I do know
you, and I think you're great.

20:32.808 --> 20:33.974
And don't you forget that.

20:34.010 --> 20:35.876
No matter what I say
in civil court

20:35.912 --> 20:38.646
when that poor paralyzed boy's
family decides to sue us.

20:38.681 --> 20:40.848
LINDA: Ugh, he will never
be the same, that kid.

20:40.883 --> 20:42.483
You know, I never seen
a live femur before.

20:42.518 --> 20:44.586
ZORN: Don't worry, Alangulon.
The image of that boy's

20:44.587 --> 20:46.654
broken body will eventually
fade from your memory.

20:46.689 --> 20:49.690
Now, the sound
of that boy's body breaking?

20:49.725 --> 20:52.524
That's probably gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life. [laughs]

20:52.525 --> 20:53.981
