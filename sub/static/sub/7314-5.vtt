TONY:
Petty Officer Colin Boxer is

03:26.489 --> 03:29.606
from Red Hook, which is a pretty
tough neighborhood in Brooklyn.

03:29.608 --> 03:31.492
He was the
starting two-guard

03:31.494 --> 03:33.494
on the local high school
basketball team.

03:33.496 --> 03:35.128

for shaving.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.714
Why do they not want
their players to shave?

03:37.716 --> 03:39.383
Shaving points, Ziva.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.335
In the state finals, boss.

03:41.337 --> 03:43.337
He was suspected of taking money
from bookies.

03:43.339 --> 03:44.838
Not good.
After graduating,

03:44.840 --> 03:46.473
Boxer enlisted in the Navy.

03:46.475 --> 03:48.809
He was presently
stationed at Anacostia

03:48.811 --> 03:51.645
with an undistinguished record.
Anybody talk to his C.O.?

03:51.647 --> 03:53.129

03:53.131 --> 03:54.598

03:56.235 --> 03:57.768
VCX File Share.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.521
It's for the personal use
of its CEO when he's in town.

04:00.523 --> 04:02.022
Look at this.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.807

04:07.613 --> 04:09.496
Born in Calcutta,
graduated from Stanford.

04:09.498 --> 04:12.165
Oh, yeah. I have read about him

all over the world.

04:13.752 --> 04:16.420

04:21.377 --> 04:23.010
They knew he was here
in Washington,

04:23.012 --> 04:24.494
but didn't know exactly
where he was.

04:24.496 --> 04:26.179
They tried to reach him
on his cell, but

04:26.181 --> 04:27.330
he didn't pick up.

04:27.332 --> 04:29.165
Guy like that shouldn't
be hard to find.

04:30.051 --> 04:31.134
Hey, guys.

04:31.136 --> 04:32.502
Abbs, did you get a
print off that weapon?

04:32.504 --> 04:36.189
No. The rubber bands
on the grip were clever,

04:36.191 --> 04:38.058
but our shooter
is definitely a novice.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.060
Talk to me.
Well,

04:40.062 --> 04:42.729
he filed off the visible
serial number on the frame,

04:42.731 --> 04:44.064
but he didn't know it was

04:44.066 --> 04:46.400
also stamped
on the interior slide.

04:46.402 --> 04:49.570
The gun is registered
to a Maryland pawn shop.

04:52.073 --> 04:54.575
Yeah, I sold a .22 like this

04:54.577 --> 04:56.460
to a young woman
a couple weeks ago.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.295
Uh, there wasn't anything
on the grip.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.196
Here's the
serial number.

05:00.198 --> 05:02.215
Yeah, you can't be too
careful in this business.

05:02.217 --> 05:04.217

Of course it is.

05:25.824 --> 05:26.907
Wow.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.492
She should be
wearing a mask

05:28.494 --> 05:30.043
charging that much for it.

05:30.045 --> 05:32.562
No. No, man. This
is a workhorse.

05:32.564 --> 05:34.081
Worth every penny.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.416
Girl's name
is Kim Taylor.

05:36.418 --> 05:38.085
Here's my copy
of the application

05:38.087 --> 05:40.287
I filed with the state.

05:41.456 --> 05:43.874
Sorry.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.409
Why is the weapon
still registered

05:46.411 --> 05:47.577
to the pawn shop?

05:47.579 --> 05:48.795
Let me explain
Maryland bureaucracy

05:48.797 --> 05:49.963
to you, Special Agent Gibbs.

05:49.965 --> 05:52.716
Someone wants a gun, they
fill out an application,

05:52.718 --> 05:55.018
which I file with the
Secretary of State Police.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.771
After seven working days,
if I don't hear back from them--

05:57.773 --> 06:00.256
which I usually don't--
then I'm allowed by law

06:00.258 --> 06:02.425
to deliver the weapon
to the purchaser.

06:02.427 --> 06:03.944
Paperwork catches
up eventually.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.529
Excuse me.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.648
Is this a real
Congressional Medal of Honor?

06:07.650 --> 06:10.100
You bet.

06:10.102 --> 06:12.319
How much
is one of these?

06:12.321 --> 06:13.587
Oh, it's not for sale.

06:13.589 --> 06:16.790
No, you can't sell
a Congressional Medal of Honor.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.625
It's against the law.

06:18.627 --> 06:20.610
Where'd you get it?
Some old guy

06:20.612 --> 06:22.212
brought it in,
said he needed money.

06:22.214 --> 06:23.630
Was it his?

06:23.632 --> 06:25.115
Yeah, World War Two vet.

06:25.117 --> 06:27.834
I tried to explain that it
was illegal for him to sell it,

06:27.836 --> 06:30.220
but, oh, hell, he was a hero,

06:30.222 --> 06:32.222
seemed desperate.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.341
I felt sorry for him, so,

06:34.343 --> 06:36.226
I loaned him $3,000.

06:36.228 --> 06:37.761
Think you're ever gonna
see that money again?

06:37.763 --> 06:38.979
Ah, doesn't matter.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.132
Chance to hold that
medal in my hands--

06:42.134 --> 06:45.435
the highest honor our country
can bestow on a hero--

06:45.437 --> 06:46.636
that was payment enough.

06:46.638 --> 06:50.907
Leroy Jethro Moore?

06:50.909 --> 06:53.010
What are the odds?

06:53.012 --> 06:54.644
(laughs)

06:54.646 --> 06:56.863
That's my dad's
best friend.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.168
I was named after him.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.003
You're kidding.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.423
Did he say why
he needed the money?

07:06.425 --> 07:08.475
No.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.851
McGEE:
Guy was on Iwo Jima.

07:18.853 --> 07:21.020
Crossed an open field
under heavy Japanese fire

07:21.022 --> 07:23.489
to rescue three wounded members
of his platoon.

07:23.491 --> 07:26.442
Did that despite the fact
that he was hit several times.

07:26.444 --> 07:28.143
Oh, McGee and
I saw a picture

07:28.145 --> 07:29.778
of L.J. and Jackson
Gibbs in Stillwater.

07:29.780 --> 07:32.147
It was up on the wall
of the general store.

07:32.149 --> 07:34.983
They were partners,
opened the store together.

07:34.985 --> 07:36.668
Yeah. Well, the boss
was really shaken.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.487
I almost detected some emotion
when he heard

07:38.489 --> 07:40.989
the old guy was trying
to pawn his Medal of Honor.

07:40.991 --> 07:43.008
What I do not understand is why
President Clinton

07:43.010 --> 07:44.826
is giving him the medal.
I mean, it was more than

07:44.828 --> 07:47.346
40 years
after World War Two was over.

07:47.348 --> 07:49.498
I wondered the same thing.
Found out that because

07:49.500 --> 07:51.717
of discrimination,
no African-American was awarded

07:51.719 --> 07:53.852
the Medal of Honor
until Congress passed

07:53.854 --> 07:57.272
legislation in 1996
to correct the injustice.

07:57.274 --> 07:59.758
Seven men were recommended
to receive the award.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.360
Only two were still alive.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.028
One of them
is Mr. Moore.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.679
Hey, boss.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.849
Uh, Ziva talked to Petty
Officer Boxer's C.O.

08:07.851 --> 08:09.451
He said, to make
extra money,

08:09.453 --> 08:11.286
Boxer had a night job

08:11.288 --> 08:13.205
parking cars at the
Adams House hotel.

08:14.074 --> 08:15.541
McGee and I were just,

08:15.543 --> 08:16.708
uh, headed there.

08:16.710 --> 08:17.960
Kim Taylor?

08:17.962 --> 08:19.995
She's here.
She's waiting in Interrogation.

08:19.997 --> 08:22.247
Um, she is a preschool teacher
and spends her

08:22.249 --> 08:26.251
spare time doing volunteer work
at Washington General Hospital.

08:28.538 --> 08:30.506
(door opens)

08:30.508 --> 08:33.174
I'm Special Agent Gibbs,
Ms. Taylor.

08:33.177 --> 08:34.510
This is Special Agent David.

08:34.511 --> 08:35.876
Have a seat.

08:35.879 --> 08:37.863
You're the one
I spoke to on the phone.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.063
Mm-hmm.
I wish

08:39.066 --> 08:40.933
you could have told me
what this was about.

08:40.934 --> 08:43.051
Driving in, I was racking
my brain trying to think of

08:43.053 --> 08:46.705
what Navy investigators would
want to talk to me about.

08:48.224 --> 08:50.526
That your pistol?

08:50.528 --> 08:52.828
That looks like the one
I got at a pawn shop.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.147
It is.

08:55.149 --> 08:56.999
How did you get it?

08:57.001 --> 08:59.835
Why did you buy the gun?

08:59.837 --> 09:02.754
For protection.

09:04.591 --> 09:06.542
There were some home
invasions in my neighborhood.

09:06.544 --> 09:08.510
One in the building
next door.

09:08.512 --> 09:10.579
The day after
I got the gun,

09:10.581 --> 09:13.515
I took it to a range
and actually fired it.

09:13.517 --> 09:15.851
It scared the hell out of me.

09:15.853 --> 09:18.753
I didn't want it
in my apartment.

09:18.755 --> 09:20.856
My brother said he'd take it.

09:20.858 --> 09:23.692
You gave it to
your brother?

09:23.694 --> 09:26.328
Last week.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.564
Hmm. Why did
he want it?

09:30.233 --> 09:31.733
He didn't say.

09:31.735 --> 09:34.353
What is your brother's name?

09:34.355 --> 09:37.039
Kris.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.773
Is he in some kind
of trouble?

09:38.775 --> 09:39.941
What is this all about?

09:39.943 --> 09:41.960
Where would we find Kris?

09:43.546 --> 09:46.465
He's a student at John Hamilton.

09:48.801 --> 09:51.786
TONY: This hotel has
bad Karma for me.

09:51.788 --> 09:53.672
McGEE: Not interested
in hearing about

09:53.674 --> 09:56.091
your illicit affairs
or inability to perform, Tony.

09:56.093 --> 09:57.259
(laughs)

09:57.261 --> 09:59.428
Fortunately, that's
never been a problem.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.513
No, I was talking
about my father.

10:01.515 --> 10:05.434
The Adams House is where he
always stays when he's in town.

10:05.436 --> 10:06.485
You hear from
him lately?

10:06.487 --> 10:07.636
No news is good news.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.321
Is that him?
Uh-huh.

10:11.524 --> 10:13.141
Bodie. NCIS.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.310
Understand you were working here
last night.

10:15.312 --> 10:16.478
Yeah.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.864
Colin Boxer worked
the night shift with you?

10:18.866 --> 10:20.532
Uh, last night?

10:20.534 --> 10:22.568
Maybe. Excuse me.

10:24.537 --> 10:26.488
According to the cashier,
you were both here.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.674
Yeah, I guess he was.

10:31.661 --> 10:32.844
Maybe working
a double shift

10:32.846 --> 10:34.680
has made your memory
a little foggy, Bodie.

10:34.682 --> 10:36.098
Yeah, maybe we should do this
at headquarters.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.183
TONY: That's a good idea.
No.

10:38.185 --> 10:40.219
Okay, look,

10:40.221 --> 10:42.671
I told Boxer not to do it.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.473
That he'd get in trouble.

10:44.475 --> 10:46.675
But he's crazy, all right?
He wouldn't listen.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.393
Listen to what?

10:48.395 --> 10:50.562
I had nothing to do
with taking that Ferrari.

10:51.447 --> 10:53.565
Hey.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.651
That's... that's what
this is about, right?

10:55.653 --> 10:57.202
Just tell us
what happened.

10:57.204 --> 11:01.540
All right, about 1:00
last night, this dude checks in.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.875
Hot car, even hotter babe.

11:03.877 --> 11:05.160
Things were slow.

11:05.162 --> 11:06.712
You know, we were
the only two here.

11:06.714 --> 11:09.131
So Boxer decides
he's going to take

11:09.133 --> 11:10.666
the Ferrari out
for a joyride.

11:10.668 --> 11:14.419
Figures the guy's not going
to check out any time soon.

11:14.421 --> 11:16.722
Boxer got arrested, right?

11:16.724 --> 11:18.890
No. He's dead.

11:18.892 --> 11:20.542
Shot.

11:20.544 --> 11:22.210
Shot?

11:23.045 --> 11:24.396
Wow.

11:24.398 --> 11:26.214
Wow. (sighs)

11:26.216 --> 11:27.399
Guess he wasn't exaggerating.

11:27.401 --> 11:29.901
What are you
talking about?

11:29.903 --> 11:32.887
Boxer couldn't cut it
on his Navy salary.

11:32.889 --> 11:36.074
You know, he worked nights here
to pay off this bookie.

11:36.076 --> 11:37.609
Does the bookie
have a name?

11:37.611 --> 11:39.328
He, uh...
he called him the Gimp.

11:39.330 --> 11:40.612
MAN: What?
You don't have it?

11:40.614 --> 11:42.030
Said he threatened
to kill him, but

11:42.032 --> 11:43.732
I didn't believe him.
How do you misplace a Ferrari?

11:43.734 --> 11:44.700
You sit tight.

11:44.702 --> 11:46.401
How do you lose
a Ferrari?

11:47.403 --> 11:48.920
You believe this?
No.

11:48.922 --> 11:50.339
Mr. Chaya.

11:50.341 --> 11:52.207
Are you with the hotel?

11:52.209 --> 11:54.876
NCIS.
We're federal agents.

11:54.878 --> 11:57.012
We have your Ferrari.

11:57.014 --> 11:59.581
What are you doing with it?

12:05.722 --> 12:08.757
Bullet number three.

12:09.892 --> 12:12.060
You seem distracted,
Mr. Palmer.

12:12.062 --> 12:15.147
Oh... didn't get much
sleep last night.

12:15.149 --> 12:16.264
Ah.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.450
Breena and I had our first fight.
Oh.

12:18.452 --> 12:21.102
She changed her hairstyle.

12:21.104 --> 12:23.121
She asked if I
liked it, and...

12:23.123 --> 12:24.606
I was honest.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.541
Not always the best policy.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.994
What do you
think I should do?

12:28.996 --> 12:32.080
I am the worst person to ask
about marital advice.

12:32.082 --> 12:33.382
GIBBS:
No.

12:33.384 --> 12:35.384
I am.

12:35.386 --> 12:36.468
You recover the slugs?

12:36.470 --> 12:38.119
Yes, all three-- .22s.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.389
As is the weapon found
at the crime scene.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.624
Mr. Palmer
is about to take them

12:42.626 --> 12:44.843
up to Abby
for confirmation.

12:44.845 --> 12:48.180
If he can stay awake
long enough.

12:48.182 --> 12:50.399
(chuckles softly)

12:51.300 --> 12:54.736
I heard about
your namesake, "L.J."

12:56.472 --> 12:58.657
No secrets around here.
(chuckling)

12:58.659 --> 13:01.159
You never mentioned
the original

13:01.161 --> 13:03.645
Leroy Jethro before.

13:04.530 --> 13:05.864
But then, of course,

13:05.866 --> 13:08.417
there are lots of things
you've never mentioned.

13:08.419 --> 13:10.752
Ah... it's complicated.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.210
He's a great guy, Duck.

13:18.212 --> 13:20.212
Montford Point Marine.

13:20.214 --> 13:23.131
First African-American Marines.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.367
Served with great distinction.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.719
He's a humble man.

13:27.721 --> 13:31.306
Never talked much about
what happened during the war.

13:31.308 --> 13:33.325
When'd you
last see him?

13:34.527 --> 13:37.779
Sophomore year, high school.

13:37.781 --> 13:41.416
He, uh... he just left.

13:42.368 --> 13:45.353
Something happened
between him and my dad, and...

13:45.355 --> 13:48.740
my bullheaded father,
he won't talk about it.

13:48.742 --> 13:51.293
Have you tried to contact him?

13:54.080 --> 13:59.551
I wrote him to congratulate him
when he was awarded the medal.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.556
Never heard back.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.935
Yeah, okay, I'm coming.

14:18.771 --> 14:20.388
Kris Taylor?

14:21.240 --> 14:22.908
Uh, no.

14:22.910 --> 14:24.776
He's not here.

14:24.778 --> 14:26.161
Something wrong?

14:26.163 --> 14:28.997
Yes. It is 3:00 p.m.,
and we just woke you up.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.116
Do your parents know
what they're paying for?

14:32.502 --> 14:33.502
We need to talk to Kris.

14:33.504 --> 14:34.503
Can we come in?

14:34.505 --> 14:37.289
Uh... okay.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.292
Um, what-what's this all about?

14:40.294 --> 14:42.294
Mind if I look around?

14:43.463 --> 14:45.680
No, I... guess.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.099
What's your name?

14:48.101 --> 14:49.935
Alec Dell.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.937
McGEE: When was
the last time you saw Kris?

14:51.939 --> 14:53.638
ALEC:
Uh, yesterday.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.140
He didn't spend
the night here?

14:55.142 --> 14:56.608
No.

14:57.777 --> 14:59.811
What is this?

14:59.813 --> 15:02.230
It's a vacuum-pumped
beer bong.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.432
Nice.

15:05.451 --> 15:08.286
Did, uh, Kris
ever show you a gun?

15:09.155 --> 15:10.322
Uh, no.

15:10.324 --> 15:12.624
McGEE: Do you have any idea
where he might be now?

15:12.626 --> 15:14.242
No.

15:14.244 --> 15:15.494
Uh, he left here bummed.

15:15.496 --> 15:17.712
He, uh... he found out
he failed a midterm.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.047
He was all
panicked it was

15:19.049 --> 15:21.049
going to keep him from
a top law school.

15:21.051 --> 15:22.217
Hmm.

15:22.219 --> 15:25.003
Well, if you hear from him,
please give us a call.

15:41.504 --> 15:43.686
(phone ringing)

15:48.578 --> 15:50.161
Hello?

15:50.163 --> 15:51.746
Hey, Dad.

15:51.748 --> 15:53.498
Jethro.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.816
It's not Sunday.

15:54.818 --> 15:56.117
Everything all right?

15:56.119 --> 15:59.037
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's good.

15:59.039 --> 16:00.672
Um, you got a minute?

16:00.674 --> 16:02.457
Yeah.

16:02.459 --> 16:04.709
I got nothing but time.

16:04.711 --> 16:06.327
Hardly sleep anymore.

16:06.329 --> 16:08.263
(chuckles) Yeah.

16:08.265 --> 16:09.764
Hey, I, uh...

16:09.766 --> 16:12.934
I ran across something today.

16:12.936 --> 16:16.838
Are you aware that, uh...

16:16.840 --> 16:20.475
L.J. tried to pawn
his Medal of Honor?

16:20.477 --> 16:22.193
Dad?

16:22.195 --> 16:23.511
You know anything about that?

16:23.513 --> 16:25.013
Nope.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.735
You ever going to tell me
what happened between you two?

16:32.071 --> 16:36.708
I told you--
never bring up his name.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.359
McGEE:
Kris Taylor, the brother,

16:48.361 --> 16:50.111
has not been seen
since yesterday.

16:50.113 --> 16:51.746
He hasn't used
his debit/credit card

16:51.748 --> 16:54.415
or turned on his cell phone
in the last 24 hours.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.200
Agent Dorneget's
staking out his dorm.

16:56.202 --> 16:58.152
Can we connect him to
Petty Officer Boxer?

16:58.154 --> 16:59.486
Not yet.

16:59.488 --> 17:00.955
Could be road rage.

17:00.957 --> 17:03.708
You know, Boxer took
the Ferrari out for a joyride.

17:03.710 --> 17:04.992
Maybe he cut the kid off.

17:04.993 --> 17:06.460
Check Metro and
Homeland Security

17:06.462 --> 17:08.162
surveillance video--
the route from

17:08.164 --> 17:09.663
the Adams House to
the crime scene.

17:09.665 --> 17:10.848
Already put in the request.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.215
(phone ringing)

17:12.218 --> 17:14.185
Hey. Anything from that bookie
who was threatening Boxer?

17:14.186 --> 17:15.435
Got a name.

17:15.438 --> 17:17.221
Joey Zambrano.

17:17.223 --> 17:18.505
Bring him in.

17:18.507 --> 17:21.175
Yeah, well, there's a...
a slight problem.

17:21.176 --> 17:24.111
Zambrano was busted
by Metro Police this morning

17:24.113 --> 17:25.613
on an unrelated charge.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.898
We will get him as soon
as they're finished with him.

17:27.901 --> 17:28.950
That was Dorneget.

17:28.952 --> 17:30.351
Kris Taylor
just returned to his dorm.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.370
Two of you, go on.

17:33.205 --> 17:34.705
Let's go.

17:37.209 --> 17:38.960
Hey, check with the V.A.

17:38.962 --> 17:41.078
Get me an address
for L.J. Moore.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.664
On it.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.716
ABBY:
<i>I told you</i>

17:45.718 --> 17:48.252
I would call you
when it's finished.

17:48.254 --> 17:49.971
Yes.

17:49.973 --> 17:51.889
I will.

17:51.891 --> 17:53.707
Bye.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.543
(angry grunt)
This guy bugs me!

17:56.545 --> 17:58.896
Who?

17:58.898 --> 18:00.881
Mr. Vijay I'm-a-billionaire-
and-I-want-my-car-back-

18:00.883 --> 18:02.316
right-now Chaya.

18:02.318 --> 18:03.434
Did you find anything?

18:03.436 --> 18:04.885
Nothing related
to this shooting.

18:04.887 --> 18:07.438
But you can tell a lot about
someone from their car.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.245
Yeah?

18:08.270 --> 18:10.031
Yeah, we can bust this
guy if we want to.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.928
Yeah?
Based on the contents

18:12.028 --> 18:15.446
of his ashtray, he
smokes Cuban cigars.

18:15.448 --> 18:18.082
Abbs, it's not our problem.
He wears

18:18.084 --> 18:19.200
$3,000 Italian sunglasses

18:19.202 --> 18:21.252
and has Justin Bieber
on his hard drive.

18:21.254 --> 18:22.736
Can't we arrest him for that?

18:22.738 --> 18:24.622
Do you have anything positive
to say about this guy?

18:24.624 --> 18:26.207
Okay, he practices
safe sex.

18:26.209 --> 18:27.741
There's condoms
in the glove box.

18:27.743 --> 18:30.378
If that's all you got, Abbs...

18:30.380 --> 18:32.213
release the car.

18:36.718 --> 18:38.919
(knocking)

18:41.106 --> 18:43.307
(knocking)

18:45.978 --> 18:47.778
Hi, Kris.
We're Special Agents

18:47.780 --> 18:48.929
David and DiNozzo.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.481
TONY:
Can we come in?

18:50.483 --> 18:52.433
Yeah, sure.

18:53.235 --> 18:55.453
Uh... what's
this about?

18:55.455 --> 18:58.072
Did you talk to your sister?

18:58.074 --> 19:01.042
To your roommate?
No.

19:01.044 --> 19:03.110
We're investigating
a shooting.

19:03.112 --> 19:04.795
What does that
have to do with me?

19:04.797 --> 19:06.247
We've recovered the weapon--
it was registered

19:06.249 --> 19:10.468
to your sister, and she
told us she gave it to you.

19:10.470 --> 19:11.952
Yeah.

19:11.954 --> 19:13.004
Well, I mean,

19:13.006 --> 19:14.755
she did, but...

19:14.757 --> 19:16.790
I lost it.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.759
You lost it?
My car

19:18.761 --> 19:20.761
was broken into-- the
gun was in the trunk.

19:20.763 --> 19:23.514
So you didn't lose it;
it was stolen.

19:23.516 --> 19:25.149
Did you report

19:25.151 --> 19:27.518
this stolen gun
to the police?

19:28.353 --> 19:29.770
No.

19:29.772 --> 19:31.305
Hey, Kris.

19:31.307 --> 19:32.990
You going somewhere?

19:32.992 --> 19:34.442
The Laundromat.

19:34.444 --> 19:35.676
(chuckles)

19:36.695 --> 19:37.945
Not anymore.

19:37.947 --> 19:40.314
Turn around.

19:40.316 --> 19:41.866
(phone ringing)

19:41.868 --> 19:43.200
JACKSON (recorded):
It's Jackson.

19:43.202 --> 19:44.502
You know what to do.

19:44.504 --> 19:45.652
(beep)

19:45.654 --> 19:47.421
GIBBS: Hey, Dad.
You remember when I called you

19:47.423 --> 19:49.490
from boot camp
and we got into a fight

19:49.492 --> 19:50.758
and I hung up on you?

19:50.760 --> 19:54.795
And then when I came home,
just before I shipped out,

19:54.797 --> 19:56.297
you read me the riot act.

19:56.299 --> 20:00.351
You told me that
a man does not do that.

20:00.353 --> 20:02.853
Well, you should take
your own advice.

20:02.855 --> 20:04.671
We need to talk.

20:04.673 --> 20:06.190
(line clicks)

20:12.364 --> 20:14.665
(keyboard clacking)

20:17.018 --> 20:18.519
Got the security video

20:18.521 --> 20:20.187
from Metro PD.

20:20.189 --> 20:22.022
Still waiting for Homeland's.

20:22.024 --> 20:24.691
I haven't spotted
the Ferrari yet.

20:24.693 --> 20:26.510
Oh, boss?

20:31.049 --> 20:33.250
Ah. Thanks.

20:36.171 --> 20:38.372
I don't know who
he is, I swear.

20:38.374 --> 20:40.224
You never seen him?

20:40.226 --> 20:42.226
No.

20:43.711 --> 20:45.930
Is he really dead?

20:46.765 --> 20:47.932
Yeah.

20:47.934 --> 20:49.984
Shot with the gun
you admit having

20:49.986 --> 20:51.685
but claim was stolen.

20:51.687 --> 20:54.071
Doesn't look good
for you, Kris.

20:55.557 --> 20:57.191
All right.

20:57.193 --> 20:59.393
I'm gonna ask you
the question now.

20:59.395 --> 21:02.396
This is the big question,
so put your big ears on.

21:02.398 --> 21:06.067
Where were you Tuesday morning
between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m.?

21:06.069 --> 21:07.701
Uh...

21:07.703 --> 21:09.036
backpacking.

21:09.038 --> 21:10.404
Near Piney Branch.

21:10.406 --> 21:12.590
I was pissed because
I flunked a midterm

21:12.592 --> 21:15.576
and wanted to be alone.
Okay.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.179
Good. Can anyone confirm
you were there?

21:18.181 --> 21:22.099
I found a really remote
camping spot.

21:23.418 --> 21:25.603
Did you bring
your cell phone with you?

21:25.605 --> 21:26.937
Yeah.
Great.

21:26.939 --> 21:29.857
'Cause we can track that,
and it puts you right there.

21:29.859 --> 21:33.027
Just trying to help
place you there.

21:33.029 --> 21:34.361
(sighs)

21:34.363 --> 21:37.615
I didn't want to talk to
anyone, so I turned it off.

21:39.284 --> 21:41.952
You... turned it off.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.637
I want to believe
him, but...

21:43.639 --> 21:45.039
doesn't look good.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.624
Hmm.

21:46.626 --> 21:49.510
Let's try something else.

21:51.546 --> 21:53.514
You know him?

21:53.516 --> 21:55.382
No.

21:55.384 --> 21:58.469
Look, I need to
talk to my father.

21:58.471 --> 21:59.470
He's a lawyer.

21:59.472 --> 22:01.472
All right, just
a couple more questions.

22:01.474 --> 22:03.891
No.

22:06.461 --> 22:08.846
Okay.

22:08.848 --> 22:11.065
Have it your way.

22:14.486 --> 22:16.687
Do we have enough
to hold him?

22:16.689 --> 22:18.305
Well, he doesn't
have an alibi,

22:18.307 --> 22:20.274
and we can connect him
to the murder weapon,

22:20.276 --> 22:21.609
just not the victim.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.360
It's a Gibbs call.

22:24.196 --> 22:26.914
Anyone got a 20 on the boss?

22:39.344 --> 22:42.046
Hi.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.518
Leroy?

22:48.503 --> 22:50.971
I didn't know if
you'd recognize me.

22:50.973 --> 22:52.940
(laughs)

22:52.942 --> 22:55.693
Oh, those blue eyes
haven't changed.

23:03.698 --> 23:06.366
Yeah, I retired from the
post office over 20 years ago.

23:06.368 --> 23:09.435
Somehow my days
are always filled.

23:09.437 --> 23:10.320
You married?

23:10.322 --> 23:13.039
Oh, I tried it
a couple of times,

23:13.041 --> 23:14.908
but it didn't work for me.

23:14.910 --> 23:17.160
You know, it put a smile
on my face, hearing

23:17.162 --> 23:20.246
that you joined
the Corps, Leroy.

23:20.248 --> 23:23.083
Well, you had a lot
to do with that, L.J.

23:23.085 --> 23:26.586
You were my hero long before
you got the Medal of Honor.

23:26.588 --> 23:27.837
Oh.

23:27.839 --> 23:28.805
Yeah.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.290
Iwo.

23:31.292 --> 23:32.642
Montford Point Marine.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.845
Well, truth be told, I
wanted to be a marine

23:35.847 --> 23:39.215
'cause of that snazzy
blue dress uniform

23:39.217 --> 23:41.184
with those red stripes.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.036
Real sharp.

23:43.038 --> 23:44.654
(laughs)

23:44.656 --> 23:46.990
Don't see a ring.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.241
You married?

23:48.243 --> 23:50.643
Tried it a couple
of times.

23:50.645 --> 23:52.445
It didn't work
for me, either.

23:52.447 --> 23:54.247
(laughs)

23:54.249 --> 23:57.700
I guess we have more in
common than just our names.

24:01.505 --> 24:04.924
Why'd you try to pawn
your Medal of Honor?

24:06.677 --> 24:10.663
Well, it meant a lot to me
when I finally got it,

24:10.665 --> 24:12.966
but I had no family
to share it with,

24:12.968 --> 24:16.186
and over the years, it was just
collecting dust on a shelf.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.305
When the lift
broke down,

24:19.307 --> 24:20.857
a lot of people
couldn't go

24:20.859 --> 24:22.892
in and out of the building.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.145
They didn't have the
money to fix it, so...

24:25.980 --> 24:28.198
I put the medal to good use.

24:32.119 --> 24:34.420
You haven't asked
about my father.

24:34.422 --> 24:37.373
Well, you haven't said
anything about him.

24:39.393 --> 24:40.627
He alive?

24:40.629 --> 24:41.794
Oh, yeah.

24:43.864 --> 24:45.832
He hasn't changed much.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.101
Hmm.

24:48.103 --> 24:50.420
He's still got the store.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.589
Hmm.

24:56.877 --> 24:59.062
Why'd you leave Stillwater?

25:01.182 --> 25:03.183
Well, I'm sure
your father and I have

25:03.185 --> 25:06.052
different versions
about what happened.

25:06.054 --> 25:07.654
Why don't you ask him?

25:08.489 --> 25:11.224
I have;
he won't talk about it.

25:12.409 --> 25:14.244
A poker game is
about to begin,

25:14.246 --> 25:15.361
and if I don't
referee,

25:15.363 --> 25:17.614
a fight is liable
to break out.

25:18.782 --> 25:21.034
If you need anything...

25:22.402 --> 25:24.403
Well,

25:24.405 --> 25:28.758
it's been good
catching up.

25:29.576 --> 25:32.245
If you want to talk...

25:38.085 --> 25:40.270
(elevator bell dings)

25:41.388 --> 25:44.590
You don't fit the profile
of a forensic scientist.

25:44.592 --> 25:47.026
You work
at a federal agency,

25:47.028 --> 25:50.914
but you are obviously
your own person.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.982
I admire that.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.951
Thanks.

25:54.953 --> 25:56.236
Oh, my God.

25:56.238 --> 25:57.704
Ugh.

25:57.706 --> 25:59.789
You were told there was
a murder in your car.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.308
Yeah, I guess I just wasn't
prepared for all the blood.

26:02.310 --> 26:05.111
I'll just have one of
my people pick it up.

26:05.946 --> 26:08.214
Yeah, sorry.

26:12.119 --> 26:14.437
Don't be.

26:14.439 --> 26:15.955
We got to meet.

26:19.677 --> 26:22.095
You intrigue me, Abby.

26:22.097 --> 26:24.264
Are you happy here?

26:25.099 --> 26:29.235
Um, yes, very.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.970
Why would you
ask me that?

26:30.972 --> 26:34.274
I could use someone
like you in my company.

26:34.276 --> 26:38.077
To do what exactly?

26:38.079 --> 26:40.280
How about we discuss it
over dinner?

26:40.282 --> 26:43.283
There's a wonderful little
bistro in Saint Croix.

26:43.285 --> 26:46.703
My jet's at Reagan,
fueled and ready to go.

26:46.705 --> 26:50.423
We can make it in time
for supper on the beach.

26:52.543 --> 26:54.877
Um...

26:54.879 --> 26:57.496
I, uh...

26:57.498 --> 26:59.182
Could you just sign
this release form,

26:59.184 --> 27:01.651
please, Mr. Chaya?

27:08.225 --> 27:10.443
(refrigerator door closes)

27:11.678 --> 27:13.396
Don't look surprised to see me.

27:13.398 --> 27:17.350
That beat-up old truck of yours
out front was a dead giveaway.

27:20.070 --> 27:23.906
This milk's two days
past the expiration date.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.074
Why'd you drive down?

27:25.076 --> 27:26.359
'Cause of that
brazen message

27:26.361 --> 27:28.661
you left on my machine.

27:30.414 --> 27:32.298
You need to show
a little more respect, Jethro.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.700
I'm still your father,

27:33.702 --> 27:37.303
and I told you never to bring
that man's name up again.

27:37.305 --> 27:39.472
It's 40 years ago, Dad.

27:44.478 --> 27:46.479
(both sigh)

27:46.481 --> 27:49.098
What happened
between you and L.J.?

27:49.100 --> 27:52.051
Some things are left
better unsaid.

27:53.103 --> 27:57.240
He was your best friend,
he was your business partner.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.525
You named
your only son after him.

27:59.527 --> 28:02.895
I think that I deserve
an explanation.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.372
He killed your mother, Jethro.

28:17.461 --> 28:19.462
Mom died of cancer.

28:19.464 --> 28:22.181
She had cancer,
but that's not what killed her.

28:22.183 --> 28:25.051
Yeah, I know what happened, Dad.

28:26.837 --> 28:29.055
She took her own le.

28:31.658 --> 28:33.860
You knew?
Yeah, Dad,

28:33.862 --> 28:35.478
I knew.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.196
But I never told you.

28:37.198 --> 28:39.399
You were only 14.

28:40.267 --> 28:43.436
Why are you blaming L.J.?

28:45.289 --> 28:48.958
Your mother was in pain, Jethro.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.544
She didn't want
to fight anymore.

28:52.612 --> 28:56.582
She confided in L.J.
that she was going to overdose.

28:58.585 --> 29:01.170
He didn't stop her.

29:01.972 --> 29:04.791
And he didn't
tell me.

29:06.560 --> 29:11.297
She had time left, Jethro,
and I wanted every minute of it.

29:11.299 --> 29:14.133
He cheated us.

29:15.319 --> 29:18.438
We deserved to have
that time with her.

29:28.115 --> 29:30.616
That drive knocked me out.

29:30.618 --> 29:32.818
I'm going to bed.

29:42.029 --> 29:44.597
Gibbs has been M.I.A.
since yesterday afternoon.

29:44.599 --> 29:45.998
I texted and
called last night.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.016
I didn't hear
anything.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.968
There's nothing
on the desk.

29:48.970 --> 29:50.453
McGee, you sure you
don't know anything?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.104
Nope.

29:52.106 --> 29:53.856
Maybe there's a woman.
(scoffs)

29:53.858 --> 29:55.558
I seriously doubt it.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.609
Be serious.
Gibbs?

29:56.611 --> 29:58.010
(clears throat)
The last ti...

29:58.779 --> 30:01.013
Gum.
Was just...

30:04.684 --> 30:07.570
Everything
all right?

30:07.572 --> 30:09.021
My dad showed up.

30:09.023 --> 30:10.907
TONY:
Ooh.

30:10.909 --> 30:14.494
Wow, yeah, that, that
can be annoying-- dads.

30:14.496 --> 30:16.712
(chuckles) I always think
that there's...

30:18.499 --> 30:19.882
Dead end
with the bookie Zambrano.

30:19.884 --> 30:22.418
Metro police had him under
surveillance for over a week.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.719
He's got an airtight alibi.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.671
TONY: Kris Taylor is
still in lockup.

30:25.673 --> 30:27.573
We can't hold him much longer
without charging him.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.642
This may help.

30:29.644 --> 30:32.395
Homeland cameras picked up
the Ferrari

30:32.397 --> 30:33.863
after it left the Adams House.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.382
Now watch this.

30:38.318 --> 30:40.386
TONY: Looks like a
police motorcycle.

30:40.388 --> 30:44.857
Well, well, well, Petty Officer
Boxer was being followed.

30:44.859 --> 30:46.058
McGEE:
It's not a cop.

30:46.060 --> 30:47.810
We're still trying
to enhance the plate.

30:47.812 --> 30:51.864
Check and see if Kris Taylor
has a motorcycle license.

30:57.421 --> 30:59.038
Hey, Kris.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.740
My father told me
not to talk to anyone

31:01.742 --> 31:03.859
without him present.
Okay, then, just listen.

31:03.861 --> 31:05.595
This is Special Agent

31:05.597 --> 31:06.546
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

31:06.548 --> 31:07.847
GIBBS: We know
you have a Class-M

31:07.849 --> 31:09.865
motorcycle license.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.484
You got on your bike,

31:11.486 --> 31:14.420
you followed Petty Officer
Boxer, and you shot him.

31:16.590 --> 31:19.525
I have a license,
but I don't have a bike.

31:19.527 --> 31:21.927
That's not you?

31:23.647 --> 31:27.033
That's my roommate
Alec's motorcycle.

31:29.286 --> 31:31.304
Is that him?

31:31.306 --> 31:34.040
It's his helmet and his jacket.

31:34.042 --> 31:36.275
Did he know you had
the gun in your car?

31:36.277 --> 31:38.777
Yeah.

31:38.779 --> 31:40.496
Picking up the roommate, boss.

31:40.498 --> 31:42.381
Oh, hey, McGee.

31:42.383 --> 31:43.949
Hey.

31:43.951 --> 31:46.052
Uh, boss, you have a visitor.

31:53.393 --> 31:57.747
I don't dispute what
your father told you, Jethro.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.867
I did know that your mother
was going to

32:01.869 --> 32:04.020
take her own life,

32:04.022 --> 32:07.740
and I didn't... stop her.

32:07.742 --> 32:09.609
She couldn't bear
the thought

32:09.611 --> 32:12.511
of her husband
and her young son

32:12.513 --> 32:16.815
seeing her go through months
of debilitating agony.

32:17.918 --> 32:22.405
I saw so much suffering
and death during the war.

32:23.273 --> 32:25.474
I understood.

32:25.476 --> 32:27.660
So, yes...

32:30.013 --> 32:32.181
I looked the other way.

32:32.999 --> 32:35.318
And my dad found
out about it?

32:35.320 --> 32:37.870
He suspected she told me.

32:38.705 --> 32:41.691
I didn't lie when
he confronted me.

32:42.559 --> 32:44.843
We haven't spoken since.

32:44.845 --> 32:46.362
So why do you think

32:46.364 --> 32:49.649
he was upset? Because
you didn't stop her or...

32:51.368 --> 32:53.619
because she confided in you?

32:53.621 --> 32:56.138
Probably both.

32:56.973 --> 32:59.492
You have to understand
something.

32:59.494 --> 33:02.695
Your parents and I
were very close.

33:04.081 --> 33:06.265
In high school...

33:07.217 --> 33:10.319
I was as much in love with her
as your father.

33:11.755 --> 33:14.156
In that day,
an interracial romance

33:14.158 --> 33:17.059
was out of the question
in Stillwater and...

33:17.061 --> 33:18.844
most everywhere else.

33:20.597 --> 33:22.248
When I got back
from the war,

33:22.250 --> 33:26.102
I had to watch my best friend
marry the girl I loved.

33:26.104 --> 33:29.905
Did Dad know how you felt
about Mom?

33:29.907 --> 33:33.175
We never talked about it.

33:33.177 --> 33:36.545
But he knew.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.699
Your mother and I maintained
a special relationship

33:39.701 --> 33:41.900
till the day she died.

33:44.838 --> 33:47.339
With her gone...

33:48.241 --> 33:51.410
and him feeling the way
he did about me...

33:53.246 --> 33:55.197
I packed up...

33:55.199 --> 33:58.000
left the store...

33:58.002 --> 34:00.219
and Stillwater...

34:02.088 --> 34:04.073
behind.

34:15.607 --> 34:18.031
(sighs):
Where the hell is he?

34:18.034 --> 34:19.817
Not in his dorm.

34:19.819 --> 34:21.452
Motorcycle's gone.

34:21.454 --> 34:23.154
Probably skipped when
we pulled in his roommate.

34:23.156 --> 34:25.322
Well, he's not gonna get
very far.

34:25.324 --> 34:29.577
Only got $148.17
in his bank account.

34:29.579 --> 34:32.880
I ran a matrix comparing
Alec Dell's cell phone calls,

34:32.882 --> 34:35.166
texts and locations
against Petty Officer Boxer's.

34:35.168 --> 34:37.068
The two have
never communicated

34:37.070 --> 34:38.670
and don't appear
to have ever been

34:38.672 --> 34:40.804
at the same place
at the same time.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.290
I don't think this is good.

34:42.292 --> 34:43.408
What'd you order?

34:43.409 --> 34:45.710
It smells
like sweet-and-sour yak.

34:45.712 --> 34:47.629
How's your moo goo gai pan?

34:47.630 --> 34:49.429
Oh, this is delicious.

34:50.132 --> 34:51.632
What is Mensa?

34:51.635 --> 34:52.934
It's a social organization.

34:52.936 --> 34:54.851
Its members are in the top
two percent of intelligence

34:54.853 --> 34:56.387
as measured
by I.Q. tests.

34:56.389 --> 34:58.489
Well, this has to be wrong
because...

34:58.491 --> 35:01.142
Alec "Beer Bong" Dell
is a member.

35:01.144 --> 35:03.361
Really?

35:05.281 --> 35:07.398
ZIVA:
He is a senior

35:07.400 --> 35:09.233
majoring in
computer sciences.

35:09.235 --> 35:10.918
Grew up
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.120
No criminal record.

35:12.122 --> 35:14.505
McGEE: This guy's
really smart.

35:15.708 --> 35:16.341
Hey!

35:16.343 --> 35:17.175
Mm?

35:17.177 --> 35:18.293
Come on!

35:18.295 --> 35:19.243
What are you doing?

35:19.245 --> 35:20.712
Come on, come on.
Give it back!

35:20.714 --> 35:22.013
Tony, come on!

35:22.015 --> 35:23.581
Give me my food!
Mm-mm.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.049
Put down the food!
Hey!

35:25.051 --> 35:27.385
ZIVA: Frat boys!
Give it to me, my moo goo gai pan.

35:27.387 --> 35:28.419
Stop!

35:28.421 --> 35:29.587
I think I found

35:29.589 --> 35:31.823
a connection between
Alec Dell and Vijay Chaya.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.024
Mm?

35:33.026 --> 35:36.477
Two summers ago, he interned
at VCX File Share.

35:36.479 --> 35:39.364
Mm.
That's Vijay Chaya's company.

35:40.232 --> 35:42.400
(squeaks)

35:46.038 --> 35:48.706
(door opens)

35:48.708 --> 35:51.042
(door closes)

35:51.044 --> 35:53.378
Down here in the
basement, Jethro!

35:56.382 --> 35:58.916
Where'd you get the Shopsmith?

36:00.886 --> 36:03.120
L.J.:
Jackson.

36:09.762 --> 36:11.962
Time to end the feud.

36:11.964 --> 36:13.731
Why?

36:13.733 --> 36:15.149
Nothing's changed.

36:15.151 --> 36:17.468
Well, I know one thing
for certain.

36:17.470 --> 36:18.486
Ann wouldn't appreciate

36:18.488 --> 36:21.222
the way we've
been behaving.

36:23.025 --> 36:25.142
All of us have one
thing in common.

36:25.144 --> 36:29.080
We all loved
the same woman.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.335
You're not getting
any younger.

36:34.337 --> 36:36.054
Figure it out.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.658
I'm making
dinner.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.065
My God, you've gotten old.

36:47.067 --> 36:48.383
(chuckles softly)

36:48.385 --> 36:51.135
(elevator bell dings)

36:53.021 --> 36:54.672
How'd it go with your father
last night?

36:54.674 --> 36:55.807
No bloodshed.

36:55.809 --> 36:56.858
What do we got?

36:56.860 --> 36:57.775
A theory.

36:57.777 --> 36:59.193
ZIVA: Dell thought
he was killing

36:59.195 --> 37:00.962
Vijay Chaya when he shot up
the Ferrari.

37:00.964 --> 37:03.364
What's his beef with Chaya?

37:03.366 --> 37:04.515
Two summers ago,

37:04.517 --> 37:06.517
Dell interned at
Chaya's company.

37:06.519 --> 37:08.202
While he was there,
he pitched an idea

37:08.204 --> 37:09.737
for a file-sharing application.

37:09.739 --> 37:11.406
He was told it
wasn't feasible,

37:11.408 --> 37:13.190
but later Chaya
had his attorneys

37:13.192 --> 37:15.076
patent it in the company's name.

37:15.078 --> 37:17.128
They think it'll generate
$100 million

37:17.130 --> 37:19.029
in profit.
ZIVA: Dell threatened to sue,

37:19.031 --> 37:20.698
but he could not get a lawyer
to take his case.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.750
Sounds like a slam dunk, but...

37:22.752 --> 37:25.887
As a paid intern, Dell had to
sign an agreement which included

37:25.889 --> 37:27.588
a clause that said

37:27.590 --> 37:29.590
anything he developed
while there

37:29.592 --> 37:30.975
was intellectual property

37:30.977 --> 37:32.260
of the corporation.

37:32.262 --> 37:33.678
Well, we got a motive.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.879
Find Dell.

37:34.881 --> 37:36.848
The guy's got an I.Q.
of 148, boss.

37:36.850 --> 37:39.484
If he wants to stay hidden,
it's gonna be hard to find him.

37:39.486 --> 37:42.437
Let's make him come to us.

37:42.439 --> 37:43.721
Why would he do that?

37:49.077 --> 37:50.228
DUCKY:
Autopsy.

37:50.230 --> 37:51.228
Hey, Duck.

37:51.230 --> 37:52.229
Yeah?

37:52.231 --> 37:53.231
Need you up here.

37:53.233 --> 37:54.365
I'll be right up.

37:54.367 --> 37:55.249
(hangs up phone)

37:55.251 --> 37:56.367
VIJAY:
<i>I never denied it was</i>

37:56.369 --> 37:57.952
Alec Dell's idea,

37:57.954 --> 38:01.038
but my lawyers assured me
I owe him nothing.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.256
Well, legality aside,

38:02.258 --> 38:05.426
in Mr. Dell's
psychologically-disturbed mind,

38:05.428 --> 38:07.161
you deceived him.

38:07.163 --> 38:09.079
You stole a piece of

38:09.081 --> 38:12.216
invaluable intellectual
property from him.

38:12.218 --> 38:14.769
He sought vindication
but failed.

38:14.771 --> 38:16.671
But then he sought revenge

38:16.673 --> 38:19.690
when he attempted
to take your life.

38:19.692 --> 38:21.926
Dr. Mallard has profiled
Alec Dell.

38:21.928 --> 38:23.945
He wants you dead.

38:23.947 --> 38:25.563
Help us find him.

38:25.565 --> 38:26.597
How?

38:26.599 --> 38:27.899
McGEE: His life revolves
around computers

38:27.901 --> 38:30.184
and the Internet.
He's staying away

38:30.186 --> 38:32.653
from phones or anything
traceable, but if he gets

38:32.655 --> 38:35.907
the right e-mail from you,
he might respond.

38:36.742 --> 38:37.942
What would I say?

38:37.944 --> 38:40.044
That he scared you.

38:40.046 --> 38:41.929
That you got the message.

38:41.931 --> 38:43.781
That you cheated him.

38:43.783 --> 38:46.250
That you're gonna pay him
what he thinks he's owed.

38:46.252 --> 38:48.319
DUCKY:
Mr. Dell is broke.

38:48.321 --> 38:49.637
He's desperate.

38:49.639 --> 38:51.806
He's going to need money
to support himself

38:51.808 --> 38:53.624
on the run.

38:55.010 --> 38:57.645
Took the liberty
of composing the e-mail.

38:57.647 --> 38:59.397
I can forward it to you.

38:59.399 --> 39:03.150
All you have to do is
cut, paste and hit "send."

39:03.152 --> 39:05.436
As a sign of good faith,

39:05.438 --> 39:07.321
I'm going to deposit
a million dollars

39:07.323 --> 39:08.756
into his checking account?

39:08.758 --> 39:11.526
That's chump change for you.

39:12.361 --> 39:14.362
No.

39:14.364 --> 39:16.063
I'm not going to do that.

39:16.065 --> 39:18.115
GIBBS:
Okay. Spend the rest

39:18.117 --> 39:20.651
of your life
looking over your shoulder.

39:20.653 --> 39:23.404
He's already tried
to kill you once.

39:23.406 --> 39:25.489
If we don't find him,

39:25.491 --> 39:27.825
he's going to find you.

39:33.498 --> 39:34.966
(trilling)

39:34.968 --> 39:36.634
(beeping)

39:47.512 --> 39:49.780
That was taken an hour
ago in Greenup, Kentucky.

39:49.782 --> 39:51.449
Where?

39:51.451 --> 39:52.850
The Appalachian Mountains.

39:52.852 --> 39:54.685
NSA did a satellite

39:54.687 --> 39:56.020
scan of the area.

39:56.022 --> 39:58.205
Found his bike five
miles from Greenup.

40:16.992 --> 40:19.310
Good morning.

40:26.868 --> 40:29.070
(handcuffs clicking)

40:34.426 --> 40:36.494
You know, I think going
in the swimming pool

40:36.496 --> 40:37.895
is a very good thing to do.

40:37.897 --> 40:39.697
Anyway, you have
a wonderful day.

40:39.699 --> 40:41.449
You take care of yourself.

40:41.451 --> 40:43.668
All right.

40:45.554 --> 40:47.555
I'm heading home.

40:47.557 --> 40:51.292
This medal's a great honor.

40:51.294 --> 40:53.260
You risked your life for it.

40:53.262 --> 40:57.048
Doesn't belong
in a pawn shop.

40:57.050 --> 40:59.517
How did you get her
to give it to you?

40:59.519 --> 41:01.936
I got a son
who's a federal agent.

41:01.938 --> 41:04.772
Sticks his nose
in other people's business.

41:04.774 --> 41:07.041
He's very persuasive.

41:07.043 --> 41:09.977
Besides, I paid
back the loan.

41:09.979 --> 41:13.648
Well, I haven't got
the money to repay you.

41:13.650 --> 41:15.616
I know.

41:15.618 --> 41:17.234
I always figured
I shortchanged you

41:17.236 --> 41:19.153
on the store 40 years ago.

41:19.155 --> 41:21.322
Consider us even.

41:23.125 --> 41:25.292
Thanks.

41:27.129 --> 41:29.130
Well, I better hit the road.

41:29.132 --> 41:31.399
I got to get home before dark.

41:31.401 --> 41:33.951
My night vision's
not as good as it used to be.

41:33.953 --> 41:36.137
(laughing): I know what you're
talking about.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.133
Ever thought about coming
to Stillwater for a visit?

41:49.135 --> 41:51.135
Nope.

41:51.137 --> 41:52.770
It change much?

41:52.772 --> 41:54.588
Not really.

41:54.590 --> 41:57.307
My folks' place still there?

41:57.309 --> 42:00.611
It's been gussied-up a little.

42:02.698 --> 42:05.583
You want a ride?

42:09.471 --> 42:11.422
Only if I drive.

42:12.657 --> 42:14.141
You were the worst.

42:14.143 --> 42:16.127
Me?

42:16.129 --> 42:19.130
I'm not the one that totaled
your father's Studebaker.

42:19.132 --> 42:20.815
(laughs)

42:20.817 --> 42:22.433
I'll pick you up in an hour.
