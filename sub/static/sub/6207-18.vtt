35:45.284 --> 35:47.824
You're finally ready, right?

35:51.824 --> 35:53.157
There's no other choice.

35:53.158 --> 35:57.128
- There's never been a choice.
- Stop it. Stop it right now.

35:57.129 --> 35:59.629
In exchange for what?

36:00.599 --> 36:03.099
Damn it, Zachariah.

36:04.369 --> 36:06.869
Stop it, please.

36:09.842 --> 36:12.342
I'll do it.

36:12.478 --> 36:14.978
I'm sorry, what was that?

36:17.483 --> 36:19.983
Okay, yes.

36:20.586 --> 36:23.206
- The answer is yes.
- Dean.

36:24.156 --> 36:26.491
Do you hear me?

36:26.492 --> 36:29.272
Call Michael down, you bastard.

36:36.034 --> 36:41.794
- How do I know you're not lying?
- Do I look like I'm lying?

[ZACHARIAH CHANTING
IN ENOCHIAN]

37:07.366 --> 37:09.866
He's coming.

37:15.641 --> 37:18.841
Of course, I have a few conditions.

37:20.946 --> 37:22.947
- What?
- A few people whose safety...

37:22.948 --> 37:25.583
you have to guarantee
before I say yes.

37:25.584 --> 37:27.251
Sure, fine. Make a list.

37:27.252 --> 37:29.752
But most of all...

37:30.556 --> 37:34.725
Michael can't have me
until he disintegrates you.

37:34.726 --> 37:37.636
- What did you say?
- I said...

37:38.096 --> 37:42.266
before Michael gets one piece
of this sweet ass...

37:42.267 --> 37:44.735
he has to turn you
into a piece of charcoal.

37:44.736 --> 37:47.038
[CHUCKLES]

37:47.039 --> 37:51.242
- You think Michael is gonna go for that?
- Who's more important to him now?

37:51.243 --> 37:53.743
You or me?

37:54.680 --> 37:56.714
You listen to me.

37:56.715 --> 38:00.685
You are nothing but a maggot
inside a worm's ass.

38:00.686 --> 38:03.788
Do you know who I am
after I deliver you to Michael?

38:03.789 --> 38:05.222
Expendable.

38:05.223 --> 38:06.424
[CHUCKLES]

38:06.425 --> 38:10.428
- Michael is not gonna kill me.
- Maybe not.

38:10.429 --> 38:12.929
But I am.

38:14.766 --> 38:17.266

38:34.586 --> 38:35.820
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

38:35.821 --> 38:38.321
Okay, come on.

38:44.429 --> 38:46.263
Come on. Move it.

38:46.264 --> 38:48.466
No. No.

Hold on. We'll get you out.</i>

39:02.381 --> 39:04.849
Just hold on!

39:04.850 --> 39:07.444
Adam. Can you hear me?

39:14.292 --> 39:16.792
Adam?

39:39.651 --> 39:42.151
You think Adam is okay?

39:42.888 --> 39:44.889
Doubt it.

39:44.890 --> 39:47.882
Cass either. But we'll get them.

39:52.097 --> 39:54.597
So?

39:55.734 --> 39:57.435
So what?

39:57.436 --> 39:59.737
I saw your eyes.

39:59.738 --> 40:03.507
You were totally rocking the yes
back there.

40:03.508 --> 40:06.238
So, what changed your mind?

40:08.814 --> 40:11.314
Honestly?

40:12.384 --> 40:14.884
The damnedest thing.

40:15.921 --> 40:17.922
I mean, the world is ending...

40:17.923 --> 40:20.758
the walls are coming down on us...

40:20.759 --> 40:24.395
I look over to you
and all I can think about is:

40:24.396 --> 40:28.496
"The stupid son of a bitch
brought me here."

40:29.868 --> 40:32.958
I just didn't wanna let you down.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.950
You didn't. You almost did.

40:39.244 --> 40:41.744
But you didn't.

40:42.647 --> 40:43.981
I owe you an apology.

40:43.982 --> 40:48.582
- No, man. No, you don't.
- Just let me say this.

40:49.755 --> 40:53.624
I don't know if it's being a big brother
or what...

40:53.625 --> 40:57.495
but, to me, you've always been
this snot-nosed kid...

40:57.496 --> 41:01.499
that I've had to keep
on the straight and narrow.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.650
I think we both know
that's not you anymore.

41:08.807 --> 41:13.244
I mean, hell, if you're grown-up enough
to find faith in me...

41:13.245 --> 41:16.735
least I can do is return the favor.

41:22.154 --> 41:24.021
So screw destiny.

41:24.022 --> 41:25.456
Right in the face.

41:25.457 --> 41:29.947
I say we take the fight to them,
do it our way.

41:33.398 --> 41:35.898
Sounds good.
