00:15.116 --> 00:16.081
Aah!

00:16.083 --> 00:18.751
Wrong holiday, stupid.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.521
MECHANICAL SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.391
(speeding up):
Ho, ho, ho, ho...

00:25.393 --> 00:26.425
Ho, ho, ho!

00:26.427 --> 00:27.760
I could use some help!

00:27.762 --> 00:32.464
Marge, I'm watching a rerun
of an important bowl game.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.834
ANNOUNCER: And that last
touchdown makes it 67 to 13.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.069
Maggie!

00:37.405 --> 00:39.171
Lisa, what
are you doing?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.672
Marking a crime scene.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.108
To celebrate
an ancient pagan ritual,

00:43.110 --> 00:44.276
this tree was cut down

00:44.278 --> 00:47.546
and tarted up like a
dime-a-dance floozy.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.114
Oh...

00:49.116 --> 00:52.151
Next you'll have a problem
with my gingerbread house.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.354
You mean
your gingerbread McMansion.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.190
Hey, show some respect.

00:58.192 --> 01:02.194
Three gingerbread workmen
died making that.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.497
I'm sorry,
but this leg's gonna have to go.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.201
You're gonna be okay.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.203
It's almost over.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.739
Now to take care
of the witnesses.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.643
Hey, I need those
cookies for Santa.

01:17.978 --> 01:21.346
At least someone around here's
got the Christmas spirit.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.449
Yep. Come midnight,
I'll be sitting here

01:23.451 --> 01:27.453
with cold cookies,
warm milk, and hot lead.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.720
What...?
For the last three years,

01:28.722 --> 01:31.757
I've asked that rosy-cheeked
nog-hog for a dirt bike,

01:31.759 --> 01:34.293
and all he brought me
was a zillion lame-o toys

01:34.295 --> 01:37.663
that I immediately broke
and threw in this bag.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.899
(screeches)

01:40.968 --> 01:42.568
But you wanted those toys.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.603
I wanted them
till I got them.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.240
But this year,
I'm gettin' my dirt bike.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.844
Even Mac Davis himself
couldn't save this Christmas.

01:51.846 --> 01:54.780
Great, Mom. Now I lost track
of my pump count.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.448
One pump, two pump...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.650
(frustrated groan)

01:58.652 --> 02:01.120
(clattering)

02:05.493 --> 02:09.194
Bowl full of jelly,
pump lead in his belly...

02:09.196 --> 02:11.263

02:11.265 --> 02:12.698

02:12.700 --> 02:14.299

02:15.302 --> 02:17.269
All aboard the Polar Express!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.004

02:31.685 --> 02:33.318
We're flying!

02:33.320 --> 02:35.287
Yep, she'll fly, all right.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.322
You just got to
keep her happy.

I get to Santa?

03:13.994 --> 03:17.429
Oh, no. Only the top
elves get to meet Santa.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.298
You start in the

Laid off.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.992
After NAFTA, a lot of these
jobs went to the South Pole.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.660
Well, who needs
wrapping paper, anyway?

03:48.662 --> 03:51.263

03:54.668 --> 03:56.635
Ooh. You are
clearly too smart

03:56.637 --> 03:58.604
to be down here with
these dingle-bells.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.772
I'm promotin' you

04:00.774 --> 04:03.308
Uh, the rest of youse,
you're laid off.

04:03.310 --> 04:03.875

04:15.322 --> 04:16.388

04:24.431 --> 04:28.300
Kid, you got a lot of
shoddy, money-saving ideas.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.837
Like a major airline, but
you were here on time.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.338
Come with me.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.646
(playing

04:40.648 --> 04:42.414
So you're the
brown-nosed reindeer

04:42.416 --> 04:44.516
that's jingled all
the way to the top.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.751

what you're after.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.788

04:49.790 --> 04:51.523
You're out

04:51.525 --> 04:53.925
Oh, really?
Well, let me ask you this.

04:53.927 --> 04:58.096
How many kids bring
a gun to meet Santa?

04:58.098 --> 04:58.730
Okay. You got me.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.034
And I'm gettin' my dirt bike.
And you can't stop me.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.635
Security!

05:14.381 --> 05:15.881
(sighs)

05:20.087 --> 05:21.620
No disrespect, fat man,

05:21.622 --> 05:24.423
but you'd better
poop out a dirt bike.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.424
Close the door, boy.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.266

been naughty this year.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.768
But by today's standards,
naughty's nothing.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.203
I didn't get
anybody pregnant.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.905
I didn't Facebook
a kid to death.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.039

05:41.041 --> 05:42.774
Kid, this company's bust.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.544

giving out free toys

05:45.546 --> 05:46.745

cookies in return.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.981
It's not a sustainable
business model.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.049
Oh, come on, man.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.684
Things aren't that bad.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.419
They're pretty bad.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.688

06:02.396 --> 06:03.628
You go home now,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.097
and maybe there'll
be a nice pair

06:05.099 --> 06:07.432
of work socks
under your tree.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.734
You don't have
to do that.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.237
I have socks.
I'll give you socks!

06:12.239 --> 06:13.105
Thanks, kid.

06:13.107 --> 06:13.939
Now you better
head home.

thinning on top,

Oh, my God!

09:17.157 --> 09:18.823

No, that says she's

Oh, no!

09:25.265 --> 09:25.630
See?

09:25.632 --> 09:29.100
Every time we get
a tree, Mom disappears.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.370
Why couldn't it have been me?
It still could be.

Your mom paid for this tree

10:03.370 --> 10:04.836
last year, but never took it.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.171
I've watered it,
kept it fresh,

10:06.173 --> 10:09.174
and every time
I look at this blue spruce,

10:09.176 --> 10:11.209
it reminds me
of your good old mom.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.912
Here, let me trim it for you.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.183
And decorate it a little.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.988
It's a sign. Mom's okay.

10:23.857 --> 10:24.422
Thank you.

10:24.424 --> 10:28.693
Yeah. My only sale all year

10:46.013 --> 10:48.246
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

10:50.283 --> 10:50.982
Huh?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.118
I thought you said you
didn't want a tree.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.721
Yes, but then I learned that
there's always hope.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.990
Someday this war will be over.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.392
Someday our mom will be back.

11:00.394 --> 11:05.230
Someday TV will be invented,
and it will be free.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.031
Then it will cost money.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.366
But until then,
this tree will stand

11:08.368 --> 11:09.901
for everything Mom believes in:

11:09.903 --> 11:13.471
home, family, and constantly
sweeping up needles.

11:13.473 --> 11:17.442
♪ O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum ♪

11:17.444 --> 11:21.546
ALL:
♪ Wie treu sind deine bl tter ♪

11:21.548 --> 11:24.215
♪ Du gr nst nicht nur ♪

11:24.217 --> 11:25.216
♪ Zur sommerzeit ♪

11:25.218 --> 11:29.754
♪ Nein auch im winter,
wenn es schneit... ♪

11:53.714 --> 11:56.614
I pooped my tights.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.403
(machine gun firing)

12:18.405 --> 12:19.904
Ah!

12:22.075 --> 12:27.045
Nein, nein, why did I go
to the 9:00 show?!

12:27.047 --> 12:29.214
<i>Das ist Hitler.</i>

12:29.216 --> 12:30.915
(machine gun fires)

12:35.021 --> 12:37.088
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

12:38.024 --> 12:40.525
This is the last time
I bring these two

12:40.527 --> 12:43.061
to bed at the same time.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.035
MARGE:
I've always believed in you
even when others didn't.

12:51.037 --> 12:54.139
(snoring)
Can you help save
our family Christmas?

12:54.141 --> 12:56.474
<i>Marge Simpson.</i>

13:01.782 --> 13:03.448
(Marge gasps)

13:06.453 --> 13:09.187
(postman yelling)

13:21.268 --> 13:24.969
Marge Simpson, I'm on my way.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.476
Wake up, Marge.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.978
Magical memories
don't make themselves.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.914
Martha Stewart!

13:35.916 --> 13:37.749
How did you get in here?

13:37.751 --> 13:39.017
A picket fence
stood on its end

13:39.019 --> 13:41.119
makes a sturdy
and attractive ladder.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.154
Now let's make that bed.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.032
A smattering of pinecones.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.267
And with a little bit of work,
this wedding dress

13:56.269 --> 13:58.670
can make a great dust ruffle.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.739
B-But I was gonna--
oh... Ooh!

14:04.077 --> 14:07.178
So this stuff will
just shampoo out, huh?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.080
Why would you want
to shampoo it out?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.449
(Bart and Milhouse laughing)

14:11.451 --> 14:13.785
Me and Milhouse had
a snowball fight,

14:13.787 --> 14:17.055
then an ice-ball fight,
then a fight-fight.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.623
You boys want to play soldier?

14:18.625 --> 14:22.560
I can't think of a better way
to spend Jesus's birthday.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.969
I'm not sure I like
where this is going.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.339
Well, I'm not sure anyone
asked your opinion.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.981
(both grunting with effort)

14:45.919 --> 14:49.053
Squeeze your shoulder
blades together.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.890
Now march,
and after an hour you can relax

14:51.892 --> 14:53.157
with some hand-shaved hot cocoa

14:53.159 --> 14:56.494
and a trial subscription
to Martha Stewart Living.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.662
BOTH (muffled):
Yay!

14:57.664 --> 15:00.365
(hums "March of the Toy
Soldiers" from The Nutcracker)

15:00.367 --> 15:01.399
And out.
Ms. Stewart,

15:01.401 --> 15:05.470
I made a star for the tree
out of discarded water bottles.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.072
Lovely, dear, except
I would have soaked

15:08.074 --> 15:08.973
the labels off
with warm water.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.342
Then I would have
melted the plastic down

15:11.344 --> 15:12.343
in the double boiler

15:12.345 --> 15:13.511
and poured it
into a candy mold.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.981
And finally, I wouldn't have
presented it quite so proudly.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.651
I'll go outside
and make snow angels.

15:19.653 --> 15:20.051
Lie face down

15:20.053 --> 15:23.655
and your beautiful smile
will be molded into the snow.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.490
Okay.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.799
(Homer snoring)

15:34.801 --> 15:37.235
Now this is
a challenge.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.772
(orchestral instrumental of
"Carol of the Bells" playing)

15:45.879 --> 15:47.612
There, a slumbering hubby

15:47.614 --> 15:50.081
is now a traditional
Christmas tableau.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.517
Copyright
Martha Stewart.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.352
(Homer muttering groggily)

15:54.354 --> 15:55.887
He's starting
to wake up.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.655
A little
of my Hubby's Holiday Helper

15:57.657 --> 16:00.158
will calm him
right down.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.859
(concerned sigh)

16:02.228 --> 16:03.895
Don't worry, Marge,
it's a good thing.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.631
(anxious wailing)
There, there.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.932
Shh...

16:07.934 --> 16:10.101
(sighs)

16:10.103 --> 16:12.270
Martha, the house
looks beautiful.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.606
It's like Christmas with
a childless gay couple.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.808
But it's just
not the same

16:16.810 --> 16:19.344
without my family
being themselves.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.746
Well, thanks for
wasting my time.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.281
I'll just wave my magic wand

16:23.283 --> 16:25.383
and turn everything
back the way it was.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.751
You have a magic wand?

16:26.753 --> 16:27.785
Yes, I made it myself.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.221
Take an old car antenna,
marinate it overnight

16:30.223 --> 16:33.124
in the tears of a heartbroken
leprechaun, bake at 350

16:33.126 --> 16:36.527
till a rainbow shoots out of
the oven, and there you go.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.233
I guess I'll never have
a perfect Christmas.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.801
Merry Christmas, Mom!

16:43.803 --> 16:45.636
We brought you
breakfast in bed.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.673

We got to get to the airport.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.355
Did you get a good
house sitter?

17:37.357 --> 17:40.358
Moe Szyslak,
house sitter extraordinaire.

17:40.360 --> 17:40.925
(audience booing)

17:40.927 --> 17:43.494
Sticks and stones

17:43.496 --> 17:44.896
Ow! Hey, stop it!

17:44.898 --> 17:46.864
Ooh, cookies!

17:46.866 --> 17:48.800
(chewing noisily)

17:49.736 --> 17:52.570
Great at the chewing,
not so hot at the swallowing.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.407
Now, remember,
pack only necessities.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.345
(Homer laughs
like Kermit the Frog)

18:01.347 --> 18:02.447
Hey, baby, it's Moe.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.515
Calling youse
from my new bachelor pad

18:04.517 --> 18:07.251
at 742 Evergreen Terrace.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.822
Yeah, okay, sugar plum,
I'll see you soon.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.890
Hey, get this off.
Hey, get this off!

18:13.626 --> 18:14.926

18:14.928 --> 18:18.496
Now nothing stands between
us and sunny Hawa...

18:18.498 --> 18:20.031
BURNS:
Merry Humbug, everyone.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.632
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

18:21.634 --> 18:22.700
What's wrong, Homie?

18:22.702 --> 18:25.336
I got the week off
by telling Mr. Burns

18:25.338 --> 18:27.705
I had a neck injury.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.741
Mr. Burns, why'd you
come to see me?

18:30.743 --> 18:34.345
Well, last night, I had a
visit from three spirits.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.982
I wish this show had a visit
from three new writers.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.750
(both laugh)

18:39.752 --> 18:41.552
Wait, what's this?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.988
Carpetbags and
portmanteaus?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.023
Going somewhere,
Simpson?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.058
Uh, uh...

18:47.060 --> 18:51.896
Hey, guys, uh, you'll need this
on your trip to Hawaii... aah!

18:51.898 --> 18:54.298
Hmm, your
goblin fainted.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.399
Not a goblin.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.535
Simpson,
where's your Christmas tree?

18:57.537 --> 18:58.769
(doorbell rings)
Coming!

18:58.771 --> 19:01.806
FLANDERS: Homer, give me
back my tree!

19:01.808 --> 19:04.709
(both grunting)

19:04.711 --> 19:07.979
(fabric ripping,
Flanders screams)

19:11.618 --> 19:14.085
Well, I won't interrupt
your holiday any longer.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.687
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good--

19:16.689 --> 19:20.525
pop superstar/fashionista
Katy Perry?!

19:20.527 --> 19:23.027
(audience cheers, applauds)

19:23.563 --> 19:27.965
What are you people doing in
my boyfriend Moe's bachelor pad?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.402
That's right,
she's into puppets.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.471
Just what's going on here?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.540
Fine, I'll come clean.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.440
(gasps)

19:36.442 --> 19:38.776
It's a Christmas miraculum.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.044
No, it's not.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.714
I just told a lie
so we could go to Hawaii.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.349
You lied to me.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.518
Release the hounds.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.488
(hounds barking)

19:50.490 --> 19:52.490
(barking stops)

19:52.492 --> 19:55.092
Oh, they'll be here
any minute.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.932
We, uh, blew the budget
on Katy Perry.

20:00.934 --> 20:01.666
(groans):
D'oh.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.901
Someone totally needs a hug.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.941
I kissed a girl
and I liked it.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.178
All is forgiven,
Simpsons.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.415
Go and enjoy "Ha-vah-ee."

20:17.417 --> 20:18.449

20:18.451 --> 20:20.952
Just as soon as we sing
one Christmas carol.

20:20.954 --> 20:25.156
Oh, man, not the lame-o
"12 Days of Christmas."

20:25.158 --> 20:26.023
Of course not.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.059
I want to sing
the original, unabridged

20:28.061 --> 20:29.827
