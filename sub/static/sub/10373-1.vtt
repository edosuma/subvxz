00:48.632 --> 00:52.877
The ghosts are moving tonight.
Restless, hungry.

00:54.012 --> 00:58.417
May I introduce myself?
I am Watson Pritchard.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.311
In just a minute I'll show you
the only really haunted house...

01:02.312 --> 01:03.679
in the world.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.733
Since it was built a
century ago, seven people,

01:07.734 --> 01:10.557
including my brother,
have been murdered in it.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.976
Since then, I have owned the house.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.535
I've only spent one night there,

01:17.536 --> 01:19.579
and when they found
me in the morning... I

01:19.580 --> 01:22.074
I was almost dead.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.967
I am Frederick Loren.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.970
And I've rented the house
on haunted hill tonight...

01:35.971 --> 01:38.248
so that my wife can give a party.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.171
A haunted house party.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.878
She's so amusing.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.857
There'll be food and
drink and ghosts,

01:47.858 --> 01:50.386
and perhaps even a few murders.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.512
You're all invited.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.031
If any of you will spend
the next 12 hours

01:55.032 --> 01:58.276
in this house, I will give you
each 10 thousand dollars.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.163
Or your next-of-kin in
case you don't survive.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.317
Ah, but here come other guests.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.211
It was my wife's idea...

02:10.213 --> 02:12.490
to have our guests
come in funeral cars.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.093
She's so amusing.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.304
Her sense of humor is,
shall we say...

02:18.305 --> 02:19.597
original.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.975
I dreamed of the hearse,
it's empty now, but

02:22.976 --> 02:26.062
after a night in the
house of haunted hill.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.465
Who knows?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.434
This is Lance Schroeder,
a test pilot.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.694
So no doubt a brave man.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.031
But don't you think you can be
much braver if you're paid for it?

02:37.032 --> 02:41.077
And I happen to know that Lance
needs the 10.000 I'll give him.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.455
If he is brave enough
to stay all night.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.998
This is Ruth Bridgers.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.584
You've no doubt read her
column in the newspapers.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.961
She says her reason for
coming to the party is

02:50.962 --> 02:53.581
to write a feature article on ghosts.

02:53.632 --> 02:58.663
She's also desperate
for money. Gambles.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.597
You've already met Watson Pritchard.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.266
A man living in mortal
fear of a house

03:04.267 --> 03:07.144
and yet he is risking his life
to spend another night here.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.896
I wonder why.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.970
He says it's for money.

03:12.818 --> 03:16.070
This is Dr. David Trent.
A psychiatrist.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.781
He claims that my ghosts
will help his work...

03:18.782 --> 03:20.479
on hysteria.

03:20.492 --> 03:24.412
But don't you see a little
touch of greed there?

03:24.413 --> 03:27.066
Around the mouth and eyes?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.459
This is Nora Manning.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.337
I picked her from the thousands
of people who work for me...

03:33.338 --> 03:36.298
because she needed the 10
thousand more than most.

03:36.299 --> 03:40.749
Supports her whole family.
Isn't she pretty?

03:43.682 --> 03:48.018
The party is starting now
and you have until midnight,

03:48.019 --> 03:50.771
to find the House on Haunted Hill.

03:50.772 --> 03:56.975
HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL

06:33.560 --> 06:35.758
Well, where is everybody?

06:35.854 --> 06:38.507
It isn't a very warm welcome, is it?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.639
Only the ghosts in this
house are glad we're here.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.771
Are we all strangers to each other?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.990
Don't you two know each other?

06:47.991 --> 06:50.034
I'm afraid I don't
even know your name.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.529
- I am Nora Manning.
- Lance Schroeder.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.414
Is Frederick Loren a friend of yours?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.583
I've heard of him,
but I've never met him.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.169
I work in one of his companies,
but I've have never seen him.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.213
I've never met the man either,
just a phone call.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.383
- Do you know him?
- No.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.928
Well then, you're the
only one of us who does.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.262
I don't know him.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.181
All the details about
renting the house...

07:12.182 --> 07:13.223
were done by mail.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.476
- He's quite wealthy, isn't he?
- Millions.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.978
And five wives, I believe.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.105
Four, I think so far.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.858
A fifty thousand dollar
party for only five people

07:22.859 --> 07:25.353
is a little steepy even
for a millionaire.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.366
Well, if I were going
to haunt anybody

07:30.367 --> 07:33.236
this would most certainly
be the house I'd do it, eh?

07:37.165 --> 07:39.488
Who closed the door?

07:48.009 --> 07:50.582
This thing is made of solid steel.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.034
Annabelle?

08:22.168 --> 08:25.337
Our guest are here and
fortunately still alive.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.411
Is your face on yet?

08:30.552 --> 08:33.929
Dust and dirt everywhere.
The water barely trickles.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.224
- Couldn't you have the place cleaned?
- Atmosphere, darling.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.227
You know how ghosts are,
they never tidy up.

08:40.227 --> 08:44.314
Well, that's a very fetching outfit,
but hardly suitable for a party.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.233
I'm not going to the party.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.194
Mm, "You Spend The Night Ghost
Party" was your idea, remember?

08:49.195 --> 08:52.865
Since it's going to cost me $50,000
dollars, I want you to have fun.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.036
The party was my idea until
you invited all the guests.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.405
Why all these strangers?
Why none of our friends?

08:59.748 --> 09:02.791
Friends? Do we have any friends?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.570
No. Your jealousy took care of that.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.464
I had a reason for
inviting each guest.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.716
I wanted kind of a cross section,

09:10.717 --> 09:13.961
from psychiatrist to typist.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.638
And from drunk to jet pilot.

09:16.639 --> 09:20.043
They share one thing.
They all need money.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.129
Now let's see if they're
brave enough to earn it.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.190
And you call this a party?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.843
Could be.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.573
Why do you always do that?
It spoils the champagne.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.944
- It might explode.
- Never does.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.497
Would you guarantee that?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.833
- That isn't funny, Frederick.
- Would make a good headline.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.488
Playboy kills wife
with champagne cork.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.497
- Would you join me?
- No, thank you.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.637
Just a sip might improve your humor.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.014
My humor is fine, thanks.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.634
And I haven't poisoned it.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.671
It's always good to know that.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.683
Have some,
you'll enjoy the party more.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.897
Go on.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.998
Your trust is so touching.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.242
And I'm not going to the party.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.920
Of all my wives,
you are the least agreeable.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.538
But still alive.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.540
Would you go away for a
million dollars in tax-free?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.846
You want it all, don't you?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.920
I deserve it all.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.767
Your jealousy isn't tax free.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.216
And your possessiveness is maddening.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.011
If ever a man had
grounds for divorce.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.777
- But can't prove them.
- The time will come.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.307
- You'll slip up one of these days.
- You think so?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.646
If I live long enough.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.607
You remember the fun we
had when you poisoned me?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.040
Something you ate, the doctor said.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.285
Yes, arsenic on the rocks.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.088
Annabelle...

11:13.089 --> 11:16.341
You'd do it again if you thought you
could get away with it, wouldn't you?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.120
Darling, what makes you think that?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.789
Something about you.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.685
I hear that hanging is
very uncomfortable,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.464
in case you get any more ideas.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.358
Don't let the ghosts and the
ghouls disturb you, darling.

11:33.359 --> 11:37.404
Darling, the only ghoul
in the house is you.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.408
And don't sit up all night,
thinking of ways to get rid of me.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.561
It makes wrinkles.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.552
This is what she used on
my brother and her sister.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.387
Hacked them to pieces.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.973
We found parts of their
bodies all over the house.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.217
In places you wouldn't think.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.145
The funny thing is the heads
have never been found.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.065
The hands and feet,
and things like that...

12:13.066 --> 12:14.983
but no heads.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.653
The wife, probably in a rage
threatened her husband with a knife,

12:17.654 --> 12:20.614
and then, carried away by
hysteria took a swing at him,

12:20.615 --> 12:21.657
and simply went on from there.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.702
Well, she certainly went on. How many
people did she kill, Mr. Pritchard?

12:25.703 --> 12:28.538
Only two. Her husband and her sister.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.040
No one else was here.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.160
So there are two loose heads just
floating around in here somewhere?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.212
You can hear them at night.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.742
They whisper to each
other and then cry.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.301
Since our host isn't here,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.595
would anyone care to mix me a drink?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.419
Certainly, what will you have?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.633
Good evening.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.857
I'm your host, Frederick Loren.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.235
Since we're all strangers
to each other,

12:58.236 --> 12:59.987
let's get acquainted
with a drink, shall we?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.605
Mr. Loren.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.908
I advise you to call
this party off now.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.703
The ghosts are already
moving and that's a bad sign.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.706
Let me apologize for my wife.
She will join us later.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.082
- What do we have?
- Scotch with ice.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.360
- Doctor?
- I'll have the same.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.546
Now before the party begins,

13:17.547 --> 13:19.798
let's go over the details.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.134
The caretakers will
leave at midnight,

13:22.135 --> 13:26.085
locking us in here until they
come back in the morning.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.254
Once the door is locked,
there is no way out.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.936
The windows have bars that
a jail would be proud of.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.773
And the only door to the
outside locks like a vault.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.483
There is no electricity,

13:38.484 --> 13:39.985
no phone,

13:39.986 --> 13:42.404
no one within miles,

13:42.405 --> 13:45.228
so, no way to call for help.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.560
Like a coffin.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.081
So, if any of you decide
not to stay for the party

13:53.082 --> 13:55.542
you must let me know before midnight.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.838
Of course if you leave, I shan't
be able to pay you anything.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.415
I'm interest in your
reason for this... party.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.421
Besides some pleasant company.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.182
Ghosts, doctor.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.018
I think everyone wonders
what they would do...

14:13.019 --> 14:15.092
if they saw a ghost.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.442
And now my wife is giving us
all the opportunity to find out.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.028
Amusing. Ghosts, etc...

14:23.029 --> 14:25.364
being only creations of hysteria...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.893
your party should be a success.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.952
So Pritchard here promises
us genuine ghosts.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.696
Seven now,

14:33.039 --> 14:35.612
maybe more before morning.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.860
That's cheerful.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.706
4 men have been murdered this house.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.256
And 3 women.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.634
You planned your party
very well, Mr. Loren.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.584
4 of us are men, 3 are women,

14:48.596 --> 14:50.998
there's a ghost for everybody.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.892
So Pritchard, why don't you take
us on a tour through the house...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.546
and let's see what happens, uh.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.560
See that stain?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.646
Blood.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.229
A young girl was killed here.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.456
And whatever got her wasn't human.
Don't stand there!

15:16.457 --> 15:18.325
What do you mean? Where?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.680
It's too late. They've marked you.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.433
Ridiculous. The roof probably leaks.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.519
Oh, that must be what it is.
Who would want to haunt me?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.021
I would say any
self-respecting male ghost.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.857
I hope it doesn't come back.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.192
Oh Mr. Pritchard,
you are the life of the party.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.986
Oh, he hasn't even started yet.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.906
Wasn't there a man who threw his
wife into a wine vat or something?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.283
That was in the cellar.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.654
There's been a murder almost
every place in this house.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.255
All this belonged to a Mr. Norton,

16:13.514 --> 16:17.259
who didn't die here.
He was electrocuted later.

16:19.687 --> 16:24.308
Mr. Norton did a good deal
of experimenting with wines.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.811
But his wife didn't
think it was any good.

16:27.904 --> 16:32.282
So he filled a vat with
acid and threw her in.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.936
She was supposed to stay down,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.943
but the bones came up.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.916
It's a funny thing,

16:40.917 --> 16:44.537
but none of the murders
here were just ordinary.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.203
Just shooting or stabbing...

16:48.633 --> 16:51.551
They've all been sort of wild...

16:51.552 --> 16:56.048
- violent and different.
- Look out!

16:56.641 --> 16:59.142
Thank God, she didn't fall in.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.921
You mean there's still acid in there?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.451
Destroys everything
with hair and flesh.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.084
Just leaves the bones.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.928
My, it's dry and dusty down here.

17:47.483 --> 17:53.390
Because there is a cure
for that, that stinks, come on.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.534
How did you get
invited to this party?

18:09.463 --> 18:14.994
No. Let them go on.
I mean, what did he tell you?

18:17.555 --> 18:21.308
Mr. Loren said everybody
would get 10 thousand dollars.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.518
But he didn't say anything
about being locked in?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.795
No.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.480
He just made a deal
with me on the phone.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.804
But nothing about having to stay.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.694
Aren't you going to stay?

18:32.695 --> 18:36.349
If I don't, I lose
10 thousand dollars.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.272
I'm going to stay, too.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.231
- 10 thousand dollars.
- Yes.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.191
Do you believe in ghosts?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.486
I don't know.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.005
Well, I believe in what that doc
says you can spook yourself.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.634
Not a complaint, seeing things
that are not really there.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.378
Or were they?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.764
What do you do with your 10 thousand?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.641
If we get it.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.100
What do you mean "if we get it"?

19:04.101 --> 19:06.269
Won't he pay us if we stay?

19:06.270 --> 19:09.397
Oh I'm sure he will.
Ten thousand is no more to him than

19:09.398 --> 19:10.924
a nickle is for us.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.777
We were in a automobile accident.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.398
Now I am the only one in the
family who can make any money.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.063
Well, I have never
seen so many doors.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.658
Closet.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.121
Bottles.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.856
Does it go any where?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.231
Lance!

20:04.078 --> 20:05.525
Lance!

21:03.220 --> 21:04.679
Help me! Please!

21:04.680 --> 21:05.597
Lance is gone!

21:05.598 --> 21:06.681
And there's a ghost!

21:06.682 --> 21:09.380
- See what I mean?
- Please come on!

21:09.894 --> 21:13.138
Did you say Lance is gone?
Gone where?

21:22.072 --> 21:24.645
We'll have to break it down!
It's locked!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.647
Locked?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.790
Are you all right?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.497
Nothing that money won't cure.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.712
I must... have bumped my head.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.878
The only way you could
bump your head in here,

21:49.225 --> 21:51.377
is to run head on into the wall.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.638
You didn't do that, did you?

21:56.357 --> 21:58.304
Let's get a bandage on that.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.536
I wonder why they didn't kill him?

22:09.537 --> 22:10.984
Who?

22:11.413 --> 22:15.067
He didn't bump his head,
they hit him.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.076
They?

22:35.479 --> 22:40.316
Nora, when you came in,
you said something about a ghost?

22:40.317 --> 22:43.403
- There was something.
- What did it look like?

22:43.404 --> 22:48.074
Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.785
Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.358
Oh, yes.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.457
That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.335
Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.238
Was that hysteria too?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.718
You better get that
checked in a day or two.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.211
Thanks, doc.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.887
Wait for me in the hall.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.028
The ghosts are
coming closer, Mr. Loren.

23:25.029 --> 23:28.323
You really believe in your
pet ghosts, don't you Pritchard?

23:28.324 --> 23:31.193
Before the night's over,
you will too.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.037
- Would you like a drink, Lance?
- No, thanks.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.486
I'd like one. Scotsman.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.883
Mr. Loren, are you really going to
pay anyone who stays all night?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.510
Certainly, 10 thousand dollars.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.539
Will there be much
red tape, or delay?

23:52.890 --> 23:56.043
- You're in a hurry, dear?
- Frankly, yes.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.257
Or frantically.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.262
Here you are, my dear.

24:22.252 --> 24:27.408
Someone or something was in
here when I came in, but where?

24:28.550 --> 24:31.294
And if the door was locked,
how did it get out?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.013
What you saw might
have been a ghost, Nora.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.099
But what was in here
with me, was no ghost.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.969
I don't know, I was so scared.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.657
That sound different to you?

24:52.658 --> 24:53.809
Yes.

25:05.379 --> 25:09.329
Three, six, nine, twelve.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.036
12 feet.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.962
Three, six.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.855
Now I'm going to knock
on the other wall.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.849
When you hear me,
you knock on this wall.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.817
Tap lower down!

25:54.762 --> 25:58.507
Oh, Lance! I saw it again!

26:08.025 --> 26:11.474
- Where did it come from?
- From in here.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.328
But if it ran out of here,
I'd have seen it.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.998
Lance, it doesn't run,
it just floats.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.152
Yeah, but, why didn't I see it?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.496
You don't believe me!

26:30.047 --> 26:31.869
How can I?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.595
I'm Annabelle Loren.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.900
You must be Miss Manning.

26:58.909 --> 27:02.662
I realize this is a very unusual
and a very, very dull party.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.157
Wouldn't you like to freshen up?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.836
This is your room.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.630
Depressing, isn't it?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.266
I doubt if I'll spend much time here.

27:23.267 --> 27:28.639
It's going to rain. The perfect
atmosphere for my husband's party.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.817
Why did you come here?

27:32.818 --> 27:35.778
He said he'd give me
10 thousand dollars.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.865
- Why did he pick you?
- I don't know.

27:38.866 --> 27:42.395
My supervisor just came
and said I've been invited.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.082
How long have you known my husband?

27:48.083 --> 27:50.042
I just met him tonight.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.615
So...?

27:53.046 --> 27:54.698
Why you?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.929
What were you doing,
wandering around by yourself?

28:01.930 --> 28:04.724
Well, I was in the cellar with Lance.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.718
Mr. Schroeder.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.212
I just left, that's all.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.265
Don't do it again.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.515
Don't go anywhere in
this house by yourself.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.739
Go on, fix you face and I'll come
by for you in a few minutes.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.823
But I...

28:20.824 --> 28:22.726
You're in danger.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.315
We all are.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.438
But who?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.908
I hope for your sake,
you'll never find out.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.724
I am Annabelle Loren.
Are you looking for something?

28:46.725 --> 28:47.975
Not exactly.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.770
- Are you the doctor?
- No, I am Lance Schroeder.

28:50.771 --> 28:55.722
- The pilot. You've hurt yourself?
- Oh, it's just a bump on the head.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.309
- Which is my room?
- I believe this is it.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.141
Thank you, Mrs. Loren.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.061
Annabelle, Lance.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.673
You were with the
young girl in the cellar.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.133
- Why was she so upset?
- Was she?

29:21.134 --> 29:24.387
And you don't look like the type
to go around bumping your head.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.389
What did it really happened, Lance?

29:26.390 --> 29:30.685
Well, Nora thought she saw a ghost,
but I didn't see anything.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.144
She was just frightened then?

29:32.145 --> 29:35.173
And mad at me I think.
I kidded her about it.

29:35.732 --> 29:39.026
I wouldn't joke about anything
else that happens here tonight.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.805
Now don't tell me that
you're taking all this seriously.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.615
Aren't you?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.690
Well, I'd like to
find out what hit me.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.316
Lance...

29:51.832 --> 29:54.781
If I need help, may I count on you?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.783
Yeah, sure, I guess so.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.007
Look, what's going on here anyway?

30:01.008 --> 30:03.092
I mean what is with
this party business?

30:03.093 --> 30:05.303
This is no party.
He is planning something.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.674
- Your husband?
- I don't think he really was.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.350
Must be pretty big if he is
going to lay out 50 thousand.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.728
Money doesn't mean anything.

30:13.729 --> 30:17.759
He has a reason for getting us all
up here to this dreadful old house.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.059
Well what for?
He doesn't even knows us.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.892
Maybe that's exactly why you're here?

30:23.322 --> 30:25.698
Well, what can he get away with?

30:25.699 --> 30:29.194
Oh, he thinks his big money like
his can getaway with anything.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.196
You know of course
that I'm his fourth wife.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.665
The first simply disappeared.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.818
The other two died.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.616
Lance,

30:38.754 --> 30:41.122
I don't want to join them.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.050
You mean he...

30:44.051 --> 30:47.546
All his doctors said they
died of heart attacks.

30:47.554 --> 30:53.184
- Two girls in their twenties.
- Well, what can he do?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.895
My husband is sometimes
insane with jealousy.

30:55.896 --> 31:00.566
Nothing matters to him anymore.
Please be careful.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.219
Would he hurt you?

31:03.695 --> 31:06.143
He would kill me if he could.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.012
Annabelle,
you're missing all the fun.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.224
Nora Manning was almost
killed by a falling chandelier.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.934
The pilot bashed his head in.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.394
Is he badly hurt?

31:36.395 --> 31:39.674
The saturnine psychiatrist
bandaged him up.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.732
Don't you want to go and console him?

31:41.733 --> 31:45.262
As you do with most
men in your fashion.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.155
You are so clever, Frederick.

31:48.156 --> 31:51.158
Since I lie awake at nights,
wondering why I married you.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.119
It was rather a mistake.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.287
You didn't marry me, dear.
I married you.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.816
Unpleasant, but no mistake.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.583
Hurry up.

31:59.584 --> 32:03.534
Frederick, for last time,
I'm not going to your party.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.375
And for last time,
it's not my party, but yours.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.044
And you are going.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.973
- I am not.
- You ready dear?

32:13.974 --> 32:17.643
- No.
- Are you ready dear?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.687
Yes, damn you.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.356
Would you adore me
as much if I was poor?

32:22.357 --> 32:26.478
No, thought you wanted
to be as a lovely widow.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.731
It's almost time to
lock up the house.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.685
Then your party will really begin.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.151
I wonder how it will end.

32:55.849 --> 33:01.050
- It's close to midnight, Lance.
- Okay, I'll be down in a minute.

33:07.027 --> 33:10.146
- Who is it?
- Your host, my dear.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.532
It's almost midnight, Nora.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.493
We're all going to get together
down in the living room.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.773
Alright Mr. Loren,
I'll be right down.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.888
Come with us.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.291
Come with us, before he kills you.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.648
Where is Nora? Miss Manning?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.996
I don't want to stay here!

34:42.998 --> 34:45.116
Nora, what happened?

34:55.217 --> 34:58.220
That's Jonas Slydes and his wife.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.889
They have been caretakers
here for years.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.975
She's blind, you know?

35:02.976 --> 35:05.378
I'm not going to stay here!

35:07.522 --> 35:11.817
Well doctor, it looks like we have a
real case of hysteria on our hands.

35:11.818 --> 35:16.268
Oh, I thinks she's just a
little upset, not hysterical.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.650
Good evening.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.114
Hello, my dear.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.796
This is my wife.
These are our guests.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.256
Ruth Bridgers.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.758
Dr. Trent.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.635
You know Watson Pritchard, of course.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.720
Nora Manning and...

35:39.721 --> 35:42.624
This is Lance Schroeder.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.105
Get me out of here!

35:50.106 --> 35:51.690
Now what about the 10 thousand?

35:51.691 --> 35:53.442
I don't care. He wants to kill me.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.694
Who wants to kill you?

35:55.695 --> 35:57.438
Mr. Loren.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.199
May I have your attention, please.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.951
I think you all remember
the bargain we made

36:02.952 --> 36:06.789
about staying all night.
10 thousand dollars apiece.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.249
If any of you don't survive,

36:09.250 --> 36:12.961
50 thousand dollars will be
divided amongst the rest of you.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.488
If I should die...

36:18.426 --> 36:21.345
You will be paid by my estate.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.181
When the door is locked from
the outside by the caretakers,

36:24.182 --> 36:26.934
we'll all be forced to to stay
in this house until morning.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.894
If any of you decide not to stay...

36:28.895 --> 36:30.771
you must leave with
the caretakers now.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.800
You won't have a chance
to change your minds later

36:34.275 --> 36:37.069
because there'll be
no way to get out.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.893
- I don't want to stay!
- Wait.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.930
It isn't midnight yet.
Who told them they could leave?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.432
They never leave before midnight.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.380
Well, they've gone now.

37:08.852 --> 37:12.312
I was going to ask you whether
you wanted to stay or not...

37:12.313 --> 37:15.691
but it seems that the caretakers
have made the decision for you.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.985
We're all locked in now.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.445
But I don't want to stay.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.531
I sorry my dear,
but it's too late now.

37:22.532 --> 37:26.034
Darling, haven't you had
enough of this silly game?

37:26.035 --> 37:29.496
Get some cars up here for these
people and let them go home.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.275
But pay them first.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.787
This is your party, remember?

37:37.797 --> 37:42.050
In spite of my wife's faith in
my ability to do the impossible,

37:42.051 --> 37:46.430
we will all have to stay in this house
until eight o'clock in the morning.

37:46.431 --> 37:50.058
But we have some
party favors for you...

37:50.059 --> 37:52.837
in these little coffins.

37:55.899 --> 38:01.153
This is my wife's idea and I must
say I think it's rather dangerous.

38:01.154 --> 38:04.114
I suppose you all know how
to use one of this things

38:04.115 --> 38:05.532
but in case you don't...

38:05.533 --> 38:09.203
you just press down on this
lever with your thumb and then

38:09.204 --> 38:11.277
pull the trigger.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.531
You see, they're loaded.

38:18.087 --> 38:21.616
These are no good against
the dead, only the living.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.081
Doctor.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.251
Lance.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.543
Nora.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.506
Go ahead, take it.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.932
Miss Bridgers.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.618
- And here is yours, dear.
- I don't need it.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.245
It was your idea.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.946
Who knows, you may want to use
it on me before this night is over.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.796
Throw these guns away,
they won't do you any good.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.798
I agree with Pritchard on that point

39:02.799 --> 39:04.550
although not for the same reason.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.373
Dr. Trent...

39:08.388 --> 39:12.338
don't you approve of
our little party favors?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.602
Suppose Nora had had
a gun when she mistook

39:15.603 --> 39:17.271
the blind woman for a ghost.

39:17.272 --> 39:21.597
I don't think anyone else is going
to walk around in total darkness.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.278
Oh, I'm sure we're not going
to go running round the house

39:24.279 --> 39:26.363
shooting each other, aren't you?

39:26.364 --> 39:30.564
Who knows? Fear makes
people do amazing things.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.584
Mr. Pritchard,
you said your sister-in-law

39:38.585 --> 39:41.363
killed a man and woman
here and cut them up.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.422
You said they found hands and feet,

39:43.423 --> 39:45.632
but they never found any heads.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.218
Would you like to see
one of those heads?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.417
Would you all like to
see one of those heads?

39:50.638 --> 39:53.416
Okay, just follow me!

40:01.065 --> 40:05.265
Darling, I really don't need this.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.336
Just go look in my suitcase.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.455
Just go, look.

40:36.684 --> 40:40.103
But it was in there! A woman's head!

40:40.104 --> 40:43.053
Nora, I think you're a little upset.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.775
Would you care for a sedative?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.985
Get out! Get out all of you!

40:46.986 --> 40:49.529
All of you get out of
here and leave me alone!

40:49.530 --> 40:51.978
Just get out of here!

40:55.870 --> 40:58.568
You think it's alright to
leave her by herself, doctor?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.582
I wished she'd taken the sedative.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.751
Well, what do you suppose
she thought she saw?

41:02.752 --> 41:04.252
They're closing in on her.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.129
Look Doc, I think somebody
ought to stay with her.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.923
There could be a million
people around her

41:07.924 --> 41:10.543
but if they wanted her,
they'd get her.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.012
What if he's right?

41:14.013 --> 41:16.014
He's too drunk to know
what he's talking about.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.794
I wonder. I'll join you in a minute.

41:25.233 --> 41:28.735
Do you think it would do any good
if you went in and talk to her?

41:28.736 --> 41:32.197
Would you think there really
was a head in her suitcase?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.657
I don't know.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.243
Something like that would
put me right over the edge.

41:36.244 --> 41:40.747
Well, could you sort of stay up here,
I mean, in case she needs help?

41:40.748 --> 41:45.494
All right. I'll be in my room.
Just call if you need.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.075
Thanks.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.851
Are you sure there are only
seven people in this house?

42:00.852 --> 42:03.270
Positive, except for the ghosts.

42:03.271 --> 42:07.551
I don't believe in ghosts
nor in frightening women.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.235
In Nora's case, it's gone far enough.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.862
Perhaps too far.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.197
What do you suggest
we do about it, doctor?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.817
Don't frighten her any more!

42:40.308 --> 42:42.255
Nora?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.255
Nora?

42:54.197 --> 42:56.270
Nora?

43:18.554 --> 43:19.921
Nora!

43:21.557 --> 43:22.924
Nora!

43:34.028 --> 43:35.821
What do you know about this?

43:35.822 --> 43:39.943
They've taken her. In a little
while she'll be one of them.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.312
Where is Nora?

43:43.663 --> 43:44.955
Where is she?

43:44.956 --> 43:46.665
It's too late.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.333
You'll never find her again.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.752
Pritchard, if you know where
she is, you'd better tell me now!

43:50.753 --> 43:52.546
She's gone! She's gone with them!

43:52.547 --> 43:55.166
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.638
Nora.

44:18.281 --> 44:19.853
Take it down!

44:56.527 --> 44:57.894
Nora?

45:01.616 --> 45:03.643
She is dead, Mr. Loren.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.696
Your wife hanged herself.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.982
Suicide.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.527
- Lance!
- Nora!

45:39.528 --> 45:41.238
Lance, hide, please hide.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.391
- What's the matter?
- Hide!

45:52.291 --> 45:54.318
He tried to kill me.

45:54.710 --> 45:58.455
He grabbed me and choked
me and put me in that room.

45:58.506 --> 46:01.049
And then he went away and left me.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.076
Who?

46:02.426 --> 46:04.761
He thought I was dead.

46:04.762 --> 46:05.958
Who?

46:06.806 --> 46:09.083
Mr. Loren.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.798
Are you sure about this?

46:12.478 --> 46:17.008
I don't know. It... it was dark,
but it must have been him.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.053
Has anybody seen you
since he left you?

46:21.070 --> 46:25.065
I heard some people in that room,
but I went by and nobody saw me.

46:26.492 --> 46:28.769
Mrs. Loren is dead.

46:29.870 --> 46:31.647
But how?

46:34.959 --> 46:37.377
Loren said she committed suicide.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.504
But I think somebody killed her.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.906
Him?

47:18.294 --> 47:20.837
I'm sure you've come to the
same conclusion I have.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.589
Yeah. I think so.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.742
Let's all have a meeting
and discuss what to do.

47:25.092 --> 47:28.917
- The living room?
- Okay. In a minute.

47:42.651 --> 47:44.652
I've got to go downstairs.

47:44.653 --> 47:47.947
Now you lock yourself in here and
don't let anybody know you're here.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.949
If he thinks you're dead
he won't come here.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.603
And I'll get back as soon as I can.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.772
You'll be alright.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.085
And if you have to...

48:00.086 --> 48:01.954
you use it.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.833
So beautiful.

48:57.351 --> 48:59.503
So greedy.

49:00.062 --> 49:02.135
So cold.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.155
- What are you doing in here?
- Wait, don't we...

49:10.156 --> 49:12.229
What do you mean, coming in here?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.743
- I don't want them to take her away.
- You're drunk.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.454
- They will if you don't watch her.
- You're drunk!

49:17.455 --> 49:19.497
Alright I'll put it, Pritchard!
Why did you come into this room?

49:19.498 --> 49:21.866
- I'm the only one who understands.
- Understands what?

49:22.835 --> 49:27.005
Your wife isn't there anymore,
she's already joined them.

49:27.006 --> 49:29.799
Now Pritchard, I've had
enough of your spook talk.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.295
Get out you sot, and don't come
back into this room again!

50:07.254 --> 50:09.531
Where is what's her name...?

50:09.757 --> 50:11.124
Nora?

50:11.759 --> 50:14.928
I didn't disturb her since I
don't think this concerns her.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.501
Now you're right.

50:17.348 --> 50:22.477
Mr. Loren, isn't there some way
we can get out of this house now?

50:22.478 --> 50:25.104
No. None at all.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.856
We could try breaking out.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.931
The only door to the
outside is made of steel.

50:30.444 --> 50:33.597
The bars at the windows
are set in solid stone.

50:34.740 --> 50:36.608
We gotta stay.

50:38.077 --> 50:40.479
I'm not afraid of
your ghosts, Pritchard.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.574
But I am afraid.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.710
When we came here a few hours ago,

50:47.711 --> 50:50.964
the only thing we had in common was
the 10 thousand dollars we'd get.

50:50.965 --> 50:53.663
Now however we share something else.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.794
The death of Mrs. Loren.

50:57.429 --> 51:02.585
So far tonight, one of us was
almost killed by a falling chandelier.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.758
One of us was mysteriously slugged.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.429
One of us is being driven to
the brink of absolute hysteria.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.556
And one of us is dead.

51:13.821 --> 51:17.191
Were these accidents? Suicide?

51:17.783 --> 51:19.993
And we must stay here
for six more hours?

51:19.994 --> 51:21.361
6 hours?

51:22.496 --> 51:24.318
Six of us.

51:25.666 --> 51:28.615
- Time enough.
- Who will be next?

51:29.169 --> 51:30.741
How will it happen?

51:31.672 --> 51:34.325
Let me ask you a question doctor.

51:34.466 --> 51:37.176
You were the first one
to see my wife dead.

51:37.177 --> 51:40.430
Did you also see anything that
she could have climbed up on

51:40.431 --> 51:43.084
- and then jumped?
- No.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.427
Did any of you?

51:48.355 --> 51:50.302
There was nothing.

51:50.524 --> 51:52.650
How then did she get up there?

51:52.651 --> 51:55.987
- So high,
- Exactly, Mr. Loren, how?

51:55.988 --> 51:58.031
She couldn't have
pulled herself up there.

51:58.032 --> 52:00.309
She couldn't have
dropped from the ceiling.

52:00.576 --> 52:03.104
Do you think your
wife killed herself?

52:03.454 --> 52:04.946
No.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.194
She was murdered.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.568
By one of you.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.366
Or you, Mr. Loren.

52:17.134 --> 52:20.136
To deliberately kill someone
you must have a reason.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.430
We were all strangers to your wife.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.425
Only you had a motive for murder.

52:26.226 --> 52:29.755
What husband hasn't at some
time wanted to kill his wife?

52:29.772 --> 52:32.315
What husband hasn't had
a thousand opportunities

52:32.316 --> 52:35.276
to do it in such a way so
that he'd never be suspected.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.403
I'm not such a fool
as to hang my wife

52:37.404 --> 52:39.113
from a ceiling by a rope.

52:39.114 --> 52:40.615
The fact remains that you

52:40.616 --> 52:43.368
or one of us murdered Mrs. Loren.

52:43.369 --> 52:46.996
- And that's the matter for the police.
- So, how do we get the police?

52:46.997 --> 52:49.741
That's my point.
We can't until morning.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.668
What began as a silly party

52:51.669 --> 52:55.004
given by an eccentric,
has now involved us all in murder.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.756
For once Pritchard may be right.

52:56.757 --> 52:59.967
If another murder is in the
works, let's stop it now.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.679
- Another murder?
- Why not?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.458
Maybe one of us saw much.

53:07.935 --> 53:11.270
Why should even a millionaire want to
give each of us 10 thousand dollars

53:11.271 --> 53:13.815
to spend one night in
a gloomy old house?

53:13.816 --> 53:15.900
To see some ghosts and have a party?

53:15.901 --> 53:18.861
- No.
- Have you finished trying me, doctor?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.947
And is the verdict guilty of murder?

53:20.948 --> 53:23.032
No, this isn't getting us anywhere.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.368
Somebody killed
Mrs. Loren, we know that.

53:25.369 --> 53:28.079
One of us is guilty and the
rest of us are innocent. Okay.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.248
Now what we have to do
for the next six hours

53:30.249 --> 53:33.126
is to protect ourselves...
from each other.

53:33.127 --> 53:36.129
- Do you really think...?
- I don't think anything.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.172
I just know that I'm
going to my room.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.701
And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him...

53:41.051 --> 53:42.218
or her.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.720
And if we all stay in our rooms...

53:43.721 --> 53:44.721
we'll be safe.

53:44.722 --> 53:47.640
Because the innocent will have
no reason to leave his room,

53:47.641 --> 53:50.560
and the guilty will admit
his guilt if he or she does.

53:50.561 --> 53:54.355
- And we all have guns.
- Then we are all agreed?

53:54.356 --> 53:57.509
Oh I wish this night were over.

53:59.528 --> 54:02.431
Rooms? Guns?

54:03.365 --> 54:05.893
I tell you it doesn't
make any difference.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.770
They are through with us here.

54:39.026 --> 54:41.599
What's the use of saying good night?

54:55.209 --> 54:56.656
Good night.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.926
Good night, doctor.

57:42.167 --> 57:44.444
Nora, it's me, Lance.

57:49.675 --> 57:51.201
Are you okay?

57:52.094 --> 57:54.595
They've all gone into their rooms,
and locked themselves in.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.180
Lance, I've been thinking.

57:56.181 --> 57:59.392
It was so dark there below.
Maybe it wasn't Mr. Loren.

57:59.393 --> 58:03.548
It was him, alright. He tried to
kill you and he did kill his wife.

58:05.273 --> 58:08.150
- How can you be so sure?
- She tried to warn me.

58:08.151 --> 58:09.803
Asked me to help her.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.064
The doc thinks he is going
to try and kill one of us.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.867
Now there must be a way out of
this place and I'm going to find it

58:16.868 --> 58:18.869
and get the police before he does.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.329
I'm going with you.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.607
But if he finds out you're alive...

58:23.083 --> 58:26.085
No, Nora, you're safer
here than any place else.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.739
Now just lock yourself
in and keep quiet.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.164
If I find a way out,
I'll come back and get you.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:28.696
No.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.678
No.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.684
No.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.619
No.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.179
Lance!

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:59.692
An admission of guilt, doctor?

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:02.987
Certainly not. There's either
somebody else in this house

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:04.765
or one of us has left his room.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.066
Did you hear anything?

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:14.111
- Organ music?
- That and someone walking.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.118
You got yours?

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:19.670
Ready?

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:22.915
You look downstairs
and I'll look up here.

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:24.133
Why not together?

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.136
We maybe only minutes,
seconds left to someone's life.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.880
Why waste time?

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.594
It's almost over darling.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.598
Every detail was perfect.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:45.172
- What's happening?
- We've done it.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:49.248
The perfect crime. Beautiful.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.553
Has she killed him?

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.046
Not yet.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:55.000
But she will.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.755
Get me out of this hanging harness.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:03.482
What's taking that girl so long?
What time is it?

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.527
At first I couldn't get Nora to want
to protect herself with a gun.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.153
But after you appeared at the window

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:10.572
everything began to work
just as we had planned.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.532
You were wonderful.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.493
Just the touch which finally
drove her into complete hysteria.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:17.147
It will be worth all of
our planning, darling.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.331
Where is Nora now?

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.542
- What's happening?
- On her way to the cellar.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:24.336
So scared, she'll shoot the
first thing that moves.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:28.116
- And Frederick?
- On his way to the cellar too.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.301
David, are you sure none
of them will suspect us?

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.386
Of what?

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.721
An hysterical girl
accidentally shoot somebody?

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:36.640
Who would suspect that
we planned it that way?

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.059
- That we drove her to it.
- What about my suicide?

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.019
For just a ghost party gag.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.856
We'll claim it was a dummy since
I merely want to touch you.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.482
And the caretakers?

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.734
Well, they had no idea what
they were really doing.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.945
What about Nora?
She's not stupid you know.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.449
Darling, believe me. Everything
we planned is working perfectly.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.492
Nora is sure Frederick murdered you.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.703
She can spread Frederick
attacked her the cellar, not me.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.080
And now Nora is almost
out of her mind with fear.

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.748
The heads, the music, your hanging.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.376
I tell you, when Frederick
walks in there, she'll shoot him.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.450
It's taking too long.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:09.324
David, you ought to be there.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:22.008
When you hear the shot
come down to the cellar.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.496
Nora! No!

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:01.124
David?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.461
David.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.313
At last you've got it all.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:40.318
Everything I have, even my life.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:43.321
But you're not going
to live to enjoy it.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:48.353
Come with me murderess, come with me.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:13.604
Good night, doctor.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.320
Good night, Annabelle.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:20.278
The crime you two planned
was indeed perfect.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:24.658
Only the victim is alive
and the murderers are not.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:29.553
It's a pity you didn't know when
started your game of murder

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:33.128
that I was playing too.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:40.021
There must be some
way to get in here!

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.516
It's right along here, some what.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:45.849
Lance!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.269
I've shot Mr. Loren!
He's down in the wine cellar.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:52.185
- Alive?
- I don't think so.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.238
It's him! He's alive!

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:11.541
You didn't shoot anyone, my dear.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:14.670
I loaded your gun with blanks.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.183
I can tell you all now...

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:20.679
Trent and my wife were
planning to kill me.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.465
They failed.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.597
Trent tried to throw me in the vat.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.600
My wife stumbled and fell.

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.698
I'm ready for justice to decide

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:36.104
if I'm innocent or guilty.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.875
Now there are nine.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.720
There'll be more, many more.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.180
They're coming for me now.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:13.475
And then they will come for you.
