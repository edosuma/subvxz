<i>(U HTRED)
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:05.482 --> 00:07.922
<i>I was born an ealdorman
of Northumbria.</i>

00:08.122 --> 00:10.522
<i>The rightful heir to Bebbanburg.</i>

00:10.922 --> 00:14.282
<i>But fate decreed
I would be raised as</i> a <i>Dane.</i>

00:17.002 --> 00:18.642
<i>That was my life</i>

00:18.842 --> 00:21.082
<i>until my family was murdered.</i>

00:23.242 --> 00:24.602
(ALL GRUNTING)

00:24.962 --> 00:26.962
(SCREAMING)

00:27.882 --> 00:30.362
<i>Word was spread
that I was to blame.</i>

00:30.562 --> 00:33.882
A Saxon slave, he killed his master
at a wedding party.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.322
<i>(U HTRED)
And so, with Brida, I fled to Wessex.</i>

00:39.522 --> 00:42.882
<i>To Alfred,</i>
a <i>man who would become king.</i>

00:44.842 --> 00:47.802
- Though not all agreed.
- I am my father's heir.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.962
<i>(U HTRED) I swore an oath to this king.</i>

00:51.482 --> 00:53.922
<i>An oath that lost me Brida
and prevented me</i>

00:54.122 --> 00:55.962
from joining my brother Ragnar.

00:58.002 --> 01:00.882
<i>But destiny is all.</i>

01:50.762 --> 01:52.842
(ODDA)
You don't deserve to marry.

01:53.922 --> 01:57.122
That woman is a lady
and you're a heathen.

01:57.562 --> 02:00.042
You could bathe all day,
you'd still stink.

02:00.402 --> 02:05.082
Have you been watching me, Odda
the boy? Should I be marrying you?

02:05.402 --> 02:07.562
Ten pieces of silver
for you to walk away.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.842
Does your father know you're here?

02:10.401 --> 02:11.842
Eleven pieces.

02:17.402 --> 02:19.962
How about my sword's weight
in silver?

02:20.122 --> 02:22.042
Nonsense.

02:23.842 --> 02:27.642
Then I'll marry the girl.
And tonight, I'll plough her.

02:29.522 --> 02:33.682
- Why must you talk of her like that?
- Perhaps you'd like her for yourself.

02:34.402 --> 02:36.682
You want her beneath you.
Am I right?

02:36.842 --> 02:38.762
You're impossible to reason with.

02:38.962 --> 02:40.842
Everything is a game.

02:42.042 --> 02:45.322
I hope for Mildrith's sake,
your time on this earth is short.

02:45.762 --> 02:47.482
You are not an ealdorman

02:47.642 --> 02:49.682
and never shall be.

02:57.162 --> 02:59.602
(MAN) Hey! Here!

03:10.642 --> 03:13.562
(UHTRED) I wasn't allowed to meet her.
I haven't seen her.

03:13.722 --> 03:15.322
It is the way.

03:15.482 --> 03:19.042
I was unaware of her existence
till yesterday.

03:19.482 --> 03:22.882
- She'll be plain and pious?
- Oh, she'll be pious, all right.

03:23.042 --> 03:26.442
If she was a leg-spreader,
Alfred would have been on her by now.

03:26.602 --> 03:28.282
Have you seen her?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.202
A distance away.

03:30.522 --> 03:32.802
"Plain" is a fair description.

03:33.402 --> 03:34.962
How much was the bride price?

03:35.122 --> 03:36.802
(U HTRED)
Thirty-three pieces.

03:36.962 --> 03:38.962
Which I have paid
to her godfather Odda

03:39.122 --> 03:41.522
and which I'll make sure
she receives.

03:43.442 --> 03:45.802
I've made promises.

03:46.842 --> 03:48.322
Revenge and such.

03:48.522 --> 03:51.122
Why are you here? Do you know?

03:51.602 --> 03:53.402
She brings land.

03:53.562 --> 03:57.962
I'll become a lord under Alfred.
I'll be able to make wealth, gather men.

03:58.202 --> 04:01.162
- Take back what's mine.
- All reasons enough.

04:02.482 --> 04:04.522
Plain or not,
she serves her purpose.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.122
The promises you have made
will stand.

04:07.442 --> 04:09.242
Blood feuds last a lifetime.

04:09.402 --> 04:14.202
What you do, arseling, is you
keep living each day until the last.

04:16.922 --> 04:21.402
The priest has arrived finally.
Let's get this done.

04:22.842 --> 04:24.762
You do not need to "get this done."

04:24.922 --> 04:27.002
I will make a plea to Alfred.

04:33.762 --> 04:36.162
She's here, praise God.

04:36.322 --> 04:39.802
You should stand and look respectful,
if not entirely clean.

04:39.962 --> 04:42.042
- How does she look?
- Terrified, I bet.

04:51.482 --> 04:54.402
If you could be brief with
the ceremony, Father Beocca,

04:54.562 --> 04:57.042
I'd be grateful.
I have business with the king.

04:58.642 --> 05:01.162
The bride has been given her price?

05:01.682 --> 05:03.482
She Will.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.842
(ODDA THE ELDER)
You are witness.

05:09.002 --> 05:10.642
(MILDRITH) Thank you, Lord.

05:11.762 --> 05:15.642
If the betrothed couple
would like to join me at the altar...

05:17.602 --> 05:20.882
- And join hands.
- (ODDA THE ELDER) Be brief.

05:41.282 --> 05:44.522
May God in his heaven
look down with mercy

05:44.682 --> 05:48.002
upon his devoted servants,
Uhtred and Mildrith.

05:48.162 --> 05:51.842
May he bless their union
with love, and children, and wealth.

05:52.322 --> 05:56.242
And may they, in turn,
be sure to give thanks and praise,

05:56.402 --> 06:00.562
and live each day
according to his holy word. Amen.

06:01.122 --> 06:03.962
- Amen.
- Amen.

06:04.162 --> 06:07.562
You are now joined as man and wife
in the eyes of God.

06:11.362 --> 06:13.882
(SNIFFLING)

06:14.082 --> 06:15.522
Tears of joy.

06:27.922 --> 06:30.362
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

06:33.042 --> 06:35.322
Allow me to help you with that.

06:37.322 --> 06:39.082
Thank you, Lord.

06:41.362 --> 06:43.202
I'm a lucky man...

06:44.122 --> 06:46.362
...to have such a beautiful wife.

06:48.162 --> 06:50.442
There must have been
many suitors, I'm sure.

06:50.602 --> 06:52.642
You're kind to believe so.

06:52.802 --> 06:54.322
Am I right?

06:55.922 --> 06:57.402
None suitable, Lord.

06:57.762 --> 07:00.122
My name's Uhtred. Call me Uhtred.

07:00.282 --> 07:03.882
Arseling, time we were on our way.

07:04.482 --> 07:07.962
Or from time to time,
you may wish to call me "arseling."

07:17.522 --> 07:18.962
(LEOFRIC) Lord.

07:21.362 --> 07:22.922
Danes.

07:24.242 --> 07:25.802
(MILDRITH) Why are we stopping?

07:27.042 --> 07:28.762
Who are they?

07:28.922 --> 07:31.122
Foragers, most likely.

07:31.642 --> 07:34.922
- But Danes all the same.
- Will they attack?

07:35.402 --> 07:36.802
We walk on.

07:41.842 --> 07:43.322
(MILDRITH) They're following us.

07:43.482 --> 07:45.362
(U HTRED)
We walk on. They won't attack.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.122
Then why have you
drawn your sword?

07:50.282 --> 07:53.242
To show them at least
one of them will die.

07:54.442 --> 07:55.842
One or two.

07:57.242 --> 08:01.162
- Foragers are deep into Wessex.
- They're Guthrum's men.

08:01.762 --> 08:04.122
They're a long way from Lundene.

08:11.562 --> 08:14.122
Lord, the marriage has taken place.

08:14.282 --> 08:16.642
They are now on the road
to the farmstead.

08:16.802 --> 08:19.122
Good news. Thank you, Odda.

08:19.562 --> 08:22.122
We shall see how he responds
to the challenge.

08:23.842 --> 08:27.402
Now it is done, Lord,
I do fear for Mildrith.

08:27.962 --> 08:30.082
She will have to give him the facts.

08:30.762 --> 08:34.602
Oh, he will bark at her,
Odda, I'm sure.

08:34.761 --> 08:38.121
But his real anger
will be reserved for you and I.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.922
He will not like being beholden
to God and to king.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.482
But if he is to become
a true ealdorman,

08:44.121 --> 08:47.042
he must accept his burden.
That is the test.

08:47.882 --> 08:49.202
Yes, Lord.

08:51.322 --> 08:55.522
Mildrith is his beautiful consolation.

08:55.722 --> 08:57.562
(CHUCKLES)

08:58.922 --> 09:01.322
Was he struck by her?

09:03.762 --> 09:05.362
He was, Lord.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.042
(UHTRED)
Why are you not already married?

09:17.842 --> 09:21.242
You're old enough to have had
two or three children by now.

09:21.442 --> 09:23.162
(LEOFRIC) Lord Arseling.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.122
There is a time for such questions,
and it has past.

09:26.322 --> 09:28.882
Why has Alfred gifted me
such a beautiful bride?

09:33.082 --> 09:35.202
Has a debt, I'm guessing.

09:35.362 --> 09:37.802
It's not my place to tell you.

09:40.482 --> 09:42.082
How much?

09:43.842 --> 09:46.722
My father wanted to find favour
with God

09:46.882 --> 09:49.882
so he devoted a tenth of his land
to the Church.

09:50.042 --> 09:53.642
They do not own it,
but they are entitled to its yield.

09:53.842 --> 09:56.922
Indeed, they demand its yield,

09:57.082 --> 09:59.562
even when crops fail and Danes raid.

09:59.882 --> 10:01.242
God is good.

10:01.402 --> 10:03.962
So the bishop took my father to law.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.002
How much is the debt?

10:06.402 --> 10:08.242
The Church is the law.

10:08.402 --> 10:11.482
And the law decreed that my father
owed to them a huge sum.

10:11.642 --> 10:14.842
- Quite beyond his ability to pay.
- How much?

10:15.962 --> 10:18.882
He died soon after.

10:23.042 --> 10:25.042
It is a substantial amount, Lord.

10:26.162 --> 10:27.602
It increases yearly.

10:27.762 --> 10:30.562
Alfred could remove the debt.
He has chosen not to.

10:31.242 --> 10:33.682
The amount owed
is 2,000 shillings, Lord.

10:34.082 --> 10:35.562
(SCOFFS)

10:35.922 --> 10:37.682
Damn him.

10:39.162 --> 10:41.162
Damn everything he stands for.

10:41.322 --> 10:44.882
- Damn his Church and his God.
- Lord, I don't like your blasphemy.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.762
My name is Uhtred!

10:55.042 --> 10:58.682
Though by all means, call rne "arseling"
for not seeing this sooner.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.402
(MILDRITH) Your new home.

11:16.562 --> 11:19.442
The land is good.
The buildings need repair.

11:19.602 --> 11:22.402
Families who live on the land
come to wish us well.

11:22.602 --> 11:24.402
Send them back to their homes.

11:25.882 --> 11:29.802
They've come to wish us well.
I have known them my whole life.

11:29.962 --> 11:32.402
Lord. Lady.

11:32.562 --> 11:35.562
Oswald manages the farmstead.
He lives nearby.

11:35.762 --> 11:39.562
Welcome home. And may we offer
our good wishes on your marriage.

11:39.722 --> 11:41.962
Thank you, Oswald. Thank you.

11:42.122 --> 11:46.002
And how kind of you all to gather
to greet me and my Lord Uhtred.

11:46.162 --> 11:49.762
We have prepared a table, Lord,
for your pleasure.

11:51.402 --> 11:53.802
You have my thanks, but we're tired.

11:53.962 --> 11:55.922
Of course, Lord.

11:58.402 --> 12:00.482
Thank you, Oswald. You're kind.

12:01.842 --> 12:04.642
I have a wedding gift for each family.

12:05.002 --> 12:07.402
- It is silver.
- (WOMAN) Thank you, Lady Mildrith.

12:07.562 --> 12:11.002
- For your kindness and your loyalty.
- Thank you so much.

12:11.162 --> 12:13.442
For taking care of the land
in my absence.

12:18.642 --> 12:21.282
Now, there's a welcome sight.

12:27.962 --> 12:31.562
(UHTRED) I was expecting there
to be a hall, and I find this.

12:32.802 --> 12:35.522
Pay off your debts,
and you can build a hall.

12:36.202 --> 12:39.482
Didn't I tell you the bastard thinks?
Alfred.

12:40.522 --> 12:43.922
If he believes he can make me beg,
he can think again.

12:45.402 --> 12:48.282
He doesn't want you to beg.
He wants you to obey.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.162
Never.

12:50.922 --> 12:53.362
If you have need for me, Lord,
I'll be resting.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.402
It seems I am tired.

12:55.562 --> 13:00.162
I'm 2,000 shillings in debt to the Church,
and you hand out silver to your tenants.

13:00.722 --> 13:02.802
It is my silver.

13:03.602 --> 13:06.882
- Have what's in my purse.
- I don't want what's in your purse.

13:07.082 --> 13:08.442
Then why scold me?

13:13.042 --> 13:16.242
The stoat. Your farmstead master.

13:16.402 --> 13:18.722
- Oswald.
- He'll need to be watched.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.042
- He was trusted by my father.
- He lives too well.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.402
- (LEOFRIC) I'm on my way to the barn.
- You can sleep in the house.

13:27.002 --> 13:29.802
I prefer the barn. Thank you.

13:29.962 --> 13:31.722
It is your wedding night.

13:32.242 --> 13:33.882
Good night, Lady.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.882
Arseling.

13:44.362 --> 13:46.162
(MILDRITH) May I leave now?

13:46.762 --> 13:50.962
How many pieces of silver
did you receive as your price?

13:51.122 --> 13:52.882
Eighteen.

13:53.242 --> 13:55.082
Is that correct?

13:55.642 --> 13:59.562
- The price was 33.
- I'm sure it was an honest mistake.

14:00.762 --> 14:02.602
You were robbed,

14:02.962 --> 14:04.762
as I was robbed.

14:05.282 --> 14:08.802
That price is your security,
and you will have it, all of it.

14:11.042 --> 14:12.522
May I rest?

14:16.482 --> 14:18.002
Yes.

14:18.722 --> 14:21.762
I'm sorry the day has been
a disappointment for you, Lord.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.682
For us both.

14:40.402 --> 14:42.122
(FIRE HISSES)

14:48.882 --> 14:50.882
(SIGHS)

15:19.362 --> 15:21.362
You have a good heart.

15:22.202 --> 15:24.482
Gifting your silver.

15:26.762 --> 15:30.082
Odda owes you 15 pieces more.
I'll see that he pays.

15:31.282 --> 15:33.762
And the debt's not something
I blame you for.

15:35.002 --> 15:39.002
It's Alfred's deceit.
I should have been wiser.

15:42.082 --> 15:44.122
Though I was blinded by you.

15:53.842 --> 15:55.522
You should eat.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.642
I should eat.
But I don't want to eat alone.

16:02.202 --> 16:04.522
God has made me your wife.

16:04.682 --> 16:06.002
There must be a reason.

16:07.202 --> 16:08.562
God is good.

16:08.722 --> 16:10.282
(CHUCKLES)

17:07.482 --> 17:09.642
What is it you're looking at?

17:18.682 --> 17:20.842
There's a scar across the land there.

17:21.402 --> 17:25.002
The never-ending line
of Danes on the march.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.521
Ragnar.

17:32.602 --> 17:36.362
By the time word reaches Alfred,
it would be too late.

17:37.042 --> 17:39.082
They would need wings.

17:40.682 --> 17:42.002
Go.

17:45.802 --> 17:49.362
Oswald, what town
lays in that direction?

17:49.562 --> 17:51.642
If they keep going west,
in a day or so,

17:51.802 --> 17:54.122
they'll come
to the fortress at Wareham.

17:55.202 --> 17:59.282
Take your family and the others to
the hills till they've passed. Do it now.

17:59.482 --> 18:02.562
- And the Lady Mildrith?
- She travels with me...

18:03.242 --> 18:04.882
...to Winchester.

18:05.722 --> 18:07.402
Yes, Lord.

18:12.002 --> 18:13.922
(LEOFRIC) How many do you see?

18:14.122 --> 18:16.162
The question is,
how many will follow'?

18:21.642 --> 18:25.962
Wessex is being invaded
and we're told to wait while he prays.

18:26.122 --> 18:27.962
God is his strength, Uhtred.

18:28.122 --> 18:30.522
He needs to be on horseback,
not on his knees.

18:33.322 --> 18:36.322
- I hate this place.
- It grows worse.

18:39.522 --> 18:40.962
Mildrith.

18:41.562 --> 18:43.882
I was not told you were here.
How pleasing.

18:44.042 --> 18:46.202
- Lord.
- And so much of you.

18:46.682 --> 18:48.162
(UHTRED) ls he ready?

18:48.322 --> 18:50.602
(ODDA)
The king is ready, as is his council.

18:52.522 --> 18:53.842
With me.

19:01.722 --> 19:05.322
You watched 300 men or more
march clean across Wessex

19:05.482 --> 19:07.202
and you did nothing?

19:07.522 --> 19:09.202
(UHTRED) I'm here.

19:09.562 --> 19:12.002
A messenger could have been
sent in your place.

19:12.162 --> 19:14.642
- A boy.
- Why did you not confront these Danes?

19:14.802 --> 19:17.602
You have men. That's your purpose,
to create warriors.

19:17.762 --> 19:20.402
I've been given 2O men and wives,
most work the fields.

19:20.562 --> 19:21.882
Would've been a slaughter.

19:22.042 --> 19:23.402
(ODDA THE ELDER)
But you chose not to fight.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.882
We'll never know.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.802
A warrior can only die once.
Why die in vain?

19:27.962 --> 19:31.082
The Danes have travelled
from either Lundene or East Anglia.

19:31.242 --> 19:32.722
Were they not being watched?

19:32.882 --> 19:36.802
We have been watching the ships
which remain on the Tames. A mistake.

19:36.962 --> 19:38.762
If Wareham is captured,
ships will follow.

19:38.962 --> 19:41.202
Three hundred men
will become 3,000.

19:41.602 --> 19:45.842
- My advice is we march without delay.
- I don't recall the king seeking advice.

19:46.042 --> 19:47.962
How many Danes did you witness?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.882
More than 200 by far.
Warriors to a man.

19:53.042 --> 19:55.402
Wareham will struggle
to hold them back.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.522
The peace is over.

19:58.802 --> 20:00.922
We have no choice
but to march on Wareham

20:01.082 --> 20:03.762
and pray God we arrive
before the fortress falls.

20:03.922 --> 20:06.002
You believe it is an invasion, Lord?

20:06.202 --> 20:09.162
It could well be the beginning
of a great Dane army, yes.

20:09.802 --> 20:12.882
Council is over. Ealdormen of Wessex,
prepare your men.

20:13.242 --> 20:16.162
Father Beocca,
I shall pray before we leave.

20:16.322 --> 20:18.082
Yes, my Lord.

20:19.202 --> 20:22.762
Father, I wish to
speak to the king privately.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.322
I will ask,

20:24.482 --> 20:27.362
but I note that you
are still to learn respect.

20:30.482 --> 20:34.202
Ealdorman Odda,
if I may speak out.

20:35.042 --> 20:38.362
You owe my wife
half of her bride-price.

20:38.562 --> 20:41.962
I paid 33 pieces of silver.
She received only 18.

20:42.122 --> 20:44.002
An honest mistake, she assures me.

20:48.082 --> 20:49.442
Is this true?

20:54.242 --> 20:55.882
Pay him.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.042
Ready the men
to march on Wareham.

21:04.882 --> 21:07.322
You should know
Mildrith is a joy to plough.

21:08.162 --> 21:10.002
You're a heathen.

21:11.442 --> 21:12.922
And you're a virgin.

21:13.842 --> 21:15.522
No, I'm not.

21:19.842 --> 21:21.562
Yes, he is.

21:26.122 --> 21:28.242
(ALL CHATTERING)

21:46.042 --> 21:48.122
What is it? Hm?

21:48.402 --> 21:51.082
Promise me
you will come back safely.

21:52.002 --> 21:53.722
Two arms, both ears.

21:53.882 --> 21:55.922
Promise me.

21:56.962 --> 21:58.922
I'll do my best.

22:00.082 --> 22:02.402
But only if you do the same.

22:02.562 --> 22:07.322
If they come, don't shelter in a church
or nunnery. Go to the hills, the woods.

22:07.482 --> 22:09.202
I'll come.

22:11.922 --> 22:13.922
For both of you.

22:14.682 --> 22:16.202
(LEOFRIC) Arseling.

22:16.362 --> 22:18.882
Kiss her and let's be on our way.

23:33.362 --> 23:36.402
(AELSWITH) Mildrith, my dear,
we've been looking for you.

23:36.562 --> 23:40.562
My Lady Aelswith. How good to see you,
and to see you looking as you do.

23:40.722 --> 23:42.482
It refuses to keep still.

23:42.642 --> 23:45.282
- Mine is the same.
- Oh, how we suffer.

23:45.442 --> 23:47.522
I pray we both survive.

23:47.722 --> 23:49.202
I pray we four survive.

23:49.402 --> 23:50.722
God will decide.

23:52.562 --> 23:56.042
I've missed you, Mildrith,
and I prayed for you each day.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.642
- Poor thing.
- Why poor?

23:59.202 --> 24:02.762
Living with the man
they foisted onto you, the pagan.

24:03.322 --> 24:06.082
Having to take his seed and the like.

24:06.242 --> 24:09.482
Uhtred is decent. He treats me well.

24:10.242 --> 24:11.642
He does.

24:11.962 --> 24:14.642
God will bless your loyalty.

24:14.802 --> 24:19.282
But with luck,
he will fall in battle, and soon.

24:22.442 --> 24:24.322
Please tell me that you're hungry.

24:24.482 --> 24:27.682
- I am a little.
- Meet me in the kitchens.

24:27.882 --> 24:30.042
I have arranged a meal
for the pregnant.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.682
But do not rush prayers.

24:31.882 --> 24:34.842
No. No. Of course not. Heh.

24:44.922 --> 24:49.002
Lord, he is not your most
humble or devout servant.

24:49.162 --> 24:50.682
But <i>l</i> pray...

24:51.562 --> 24:53.522
...keep him safe.

24:53.962 --> 24:56.002
Let him do your work.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.082
Let him see his child.

25:03.402 --> 25:06.722
(BEOCCA) I was pleased to see
your lady today, your wife.

25:07.202 --> 25:09.042
And carrying a child.

25:09.202 --> 25:10.562
Yes.

25:10.722 --> 25:12.602
It's God's blessing.

25:13.442 --> 25:15.082
It seems like only yesterday

25:15.242 --> 25:18.442
I was baptising you as Osbert,
and then again as Uhtred.

25:21.242 --> 25:23.802
What is it you wish to speak about
with the king?

25:23.962 --> 25:25.962
It's between myself and the king.

25:26.362 --> 25:28.442
He's watching you, Uhtred.

25:28.602 --> 25:30.762
- God?
- Alfred.

25:31.242 --> 25:33.522
Watching how you behave,
judging you.

25:33.722 --> 25:35.522
He has no right to judge.

25:35.682 --> 25:37.442
He's a king.

25:39.202 --> 25:42.002
He lied to me
regarding the marriage.

25:42.162 --> 25:43.962
Are you referring to the debt?

25:44.482 --> 25:46.882
- You know of it?
- It's not a secret.

25:47.042 --> 25:49.562
And I urge you
to show him you accepted,

25:49.762 --> 25:52.562
especially as it
is owed to the Church.

25:54.042 --> 25:57.162
You must remain calm, Uhtred,
respectful.

26:07.402 --> 26:08.762
My Lord.

26:08.922 --> 26:11.602
- I requested a private...
- Have you eaten?

26:13.802 --> 26:15.242
No.

26:16.842 --> 26:21.722
There are times
when I crave meat...

26:22.962 --> 26:25.362
...and other things.

26:25.562 --> 26:30.762
But I know the gratification would be
fleeting, the suffering prolonged,

26:30.922 --> 26:32.322
and so I suffer gruel.

26:32.762 --> 26:36.842
Though my wife will not allow it to
be called anything other than "broth."

26:37.602 --> 26:40.242
You will be happy to learn
that my spies have news.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.242
- From Wareham?
- From Ireland.

26:43.402 --> 26:47.202
Ivar, brother of Ubba, has been killed
there, which would be irrelevant,

26:47.362 --> 26:50.282
but for the fact Ubba
wishes to avenge him personally.

26:50.602 --> 26:52.362
This is true?

26:53.522 --> 26:58.682
An Irishman across the sea kills
a Dane, and the world changes.

26:59.162 --> 27:01.162
The hand of God.

27:03.882 --> 27:06.842
Is this something Ubba would do?
Abandon Guthrum?

27:07.042 --> 27:11.042
To avenge his brother, yes.
If guided by his sorcerer's story.

27:12.562 --> 27:14.562
He has a sorcerer?

27:15.802 --> 27:18.522
And what does this sorcerer do?

27:18.682 --> 27:20.602
Cast spells? Perform magic?

27:20.842 --> 27:22.162
He advises, Lord.

27:22.322 --> 27:24.202
He looks for omens.

27:24.362 --> 27:28.042
- Signs, good and bad.
- Oh, what nonsense.

27:29.282 --> 27:31.842
What are miracles, Lord,
if not magic?

27:32.042 --> 27:34.402
Miracles are performed
by God, not man.

27:34.562 --> 27:37.002
Danes say the same.
Omens are gifts from gods.

27:37.162 --> 27:38.642
And they are mistaken.

27:39.042 --> 27:41.362
Who gave the sign
for Ubba to go to Ireland?

27:41.522 --> 27:44.402
- The hand of your god or theirs?
- There's one God.

27:44.562 --> 27:47.082
Then he must have spoken
to the Danes.

27:49.362 --> 27:50.682
With Ubba now in Ireland,

27:50.842 --> 27:54.402
Guthrum must now decide
whether he will fight alone.

27:54.722 --> 27:56.722
He won't fight alone.

27:57.002 --> 27:58.722
Not that he couldn't win.

27:58.922 --> 28:01.122
He will fear losing
too many of his men.

28:01.322 --> 28:02.842
Yes, Lord.

28:04.122 --> 28:06.042
I am learning...

28:06.202 --> 28:09.642
...that the heathen
cares only for personal gain.

28:10.042 --> 28:12.922
A Dane could never suffer my gruel.

28:13.082 --> 28:15.202
"Broth," Lord.

28:17.962 --> 28:21.842
You are happy, Ealdorman Uhtred,
with Mildrith?

28:22.762 --> 28:25.322
Yes, Lord. She's a good wife.

28:27.122 --> 28:31.002
Though I never would have married her
had I known I'd owe 2,000 shillings.

28:31.162 --> 28:32.482
Which increases yearly.

28:32.642 --> 28:34.802
On your word,
the debt can be lifted.

28:34.962 --> 28:37.282
Why should I deny the Church
2,000 shillings?

28:37.442 --> 28:40.682
- I wasn't aware I'd owe it.
- It is not a secret.

28:42.162 --> 28:45.642
Sacrifice and penance are what
separate us from the heathen.

28:46.402 --> 28:49.562
I have my broth, you have your debt.

28:51.842 --> 28:54.202
Wessex needs an army,
would you agree?

28:54.922 --> 28:59.402
A permanent and formidable army.

29:01.442 --> 29:03.282
Yes, Lord.

29:03.842 --> 29:08.962
England, when it finally emerges,
shall need a greater army.

29:09.282 --> 29:14.362
Garrisons of many thousands of men,
all will need feeding and payment.

29:14.882 --> 29:17.802
It is my intention that all landowners
shall contribute

29:17.962 --> 29:21.042
to the feeding of this army
and its commanders.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.722
And I will need commanders, Uhtred.

29:25.362 --> 29:29.362
Men like the great generals of Rome.

29:31.762 --> 29:34.362
Look upon the debt as a gift.

29:35.162 --> 29:39.202
A means of proving your devotion
to Wessex and to England.

29:39.362 --> 29:43.882
- If I'd been told the truth from...
- You still wear the amulet, I see.

29:44.962 --> 29:46.442
To remind me of Earl Ragnar.

29:46.642 --> 29:50.482
Why do you not attend church with
your wife? Why do you not pray to God?

29:50.642 --> 29:53.802
God created everything
that surrounds me.

29:53.962 --> 29:57.722
The fields, rivers, the forests.
The land is my church.

29:57.882 --> 30:01.202
And I pray each day, Lord...

30:01.442 --> 30:03.402
...in silence.

30:20.762 --> 30:22.202
(ALFRED) He cannot be tamed.

30:23.002 --> 30:25.122
But he can be trusted.

30:26.802 --> 30:29.802
I will not abandon him completely.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.842
He may have a use, I'm sure.

30:44.602 --> 30:47.522
Hear me now. Wareham has fallen.

30:47.682 --> 30:49.482
We march at once.

30:49.642 --> 30:52.962
Every man is to be ready to do
as the king asks.

30:53.122 --> 30:56.162
The Danes have taken the fortress.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.562
Wareham has fallen.
We march at once.

30:58.722 --> 31:02.362
We could be slipping in blood
and entrails before the day is out.

31:02.762 --> 31:04.482
With luck.

31:23.642 --> 31:25.882
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

31:35.562 --> 31:38.122
Leave him.
There's enough for everyone.

31:46.962 --> 31:48.842
Guthrum, they're here.

31:49.722 --> 31:51.642
The Saxon army is gathering.

31:52.122 --> 31:54.722
- Is it Alfred?
- Yes.

31:56.322 --> 31:58.442
Is the fortress repaired and secure?

31:58.962 --> 32:00.402
Yes.

32:00.562 --> 32:03.042
Good. He will not attack.

32:03.202 --> 32:06.722
He doesn't need to. He knows
we'll be hungry within days.

32:06.882 --> 32:08.922
- We can raid.
- No.

32:09.362 --> 32:12.842
He will empty all the grain stores
in the surrounding villages.

32:15.562 --> 32:22.042
I have found these church rooms
to be strangely quiet and peaceful.

32:22.202 --> 32:27.322
Lord, I didn't march my men halfway
across England for them to starve.

32:28.762 --> 32:31.682
- I shall be on the ramparts.
- We came for war, Ragnar.

32:32.082 --> 32:34.402
But Ubba has reneged.

32:34.562 --> 32:38.322
- To avenge his brother.
- But you are here.

32:40.082 --> 32:43.082
Should you not be
avenging your father?

32:44.162 --> 32:46.802
- When the time is right.
- Yes.

32:47.002 --> 32:49.802
When the time is right.

32:51.682 --> 32:54.962
We have taken the first steps
against Wessex.

32:56.202 --> 32:59.082
But Ubba has left us weak.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.402
He put all of our lives at risk.

33:02.602 --> 33:05.242
So until Ubba returns,

33:05.402 --> 33:07.762
we have to make peace.

33:15.562 --> 33:17.082
(YELLS)

33:20.162 --> 33:22.402
So if you are there...

33:23.162 --> 33:24.962
...God of Rome...

33:26.082 --> 33:27.922
...strike me down.

33:30.482 --> 33:32.562
I thought not.

33:34.922 --> 33:37.082
We are here to show them
how many we are.

33:37.762 --> 33:41.522
We are here to show them
how many we are!

33:41.722 --> 33:43.842
That we are here with God.

33:44.002 --> 33:45.522
And that this is our land.

33:45.682 --> 33:47.882
That we are here with God!

33:48.162 --> 33:49.882
And this is our land!

33:51.082 --> 33:52.922
This is our land!

33:53.122 --> 33:55.282
Our Wessex!

33:55.882 --> 33:57.642
This is our England!

33:59.082 --> 34:03.882
And we shall murder any
heathen bastard that tries to take it!

34:04.082 --> 34:06.162
(MEN SHOUTING AND CLAMOURING)

34:24.482 --> 34:27.962
- They wish to talk, Lord.
- (ALFRED) I know what they want.

34:28.121 --> 34:29.522
They want time.

34:30.042 --> 34:33.562
Odda, with your guards, you shall
go with me. Leofric, you as well.

34:34.161 --> 34:37.242
- And Father Selbix.
- Yes, Lord.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.442
(ALFRED)
What do you make of the fortress?

34:39.641 --> 34:41.922
It looks strong enough, Lord.

34:42.641 --> 34:46.121
No breach.
No signs of lasting damage.

34:46.282 --> 34:48.161
And if we attacked?

34:49.322 --> 34:51.242
We would suffer.

34:52.242 --> 34:55.002
We'd be lucky
to see the inside, Lord.

34:56.842 --> 34:58.522
Good morning, King Alfred.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.802
Guthrum of the Danes.

35:00.962 --> 35:04.442
I, too, am a king now,
of East Anglia.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.002
You don't need to bow.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.082
I will begin.

35:09.242 --> 35:10.842
I propose a truce.

35:12.602 --> 35:16.442
For any truce to occur, Earl Guthrum,
you must leave Wessex once again.

35:16.602 --> 35:18.962
- And if I refuse?
- We surround you.

35:19.122 --> 35:20.962
Yes, you surround a small fortress,

35:21.122 --> 35:24.202
but we Danes surround
your entire kingdom. That said,

35:24.362 --> 35:27.442
I've decided I shall leave by sea.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.802
Therefore, I will send for ships.

35:30.042 --> 35:32.402
- How many ships?
- No more than 15.

35:33.322 --> 35:34.642
Very well.

35:34.802 --> 35:36.722
Your ships have one month to arrive.

35:36.882 --> 35:40.442
- Not enough time.
- Food and ale for one month only,

35:40.602 --> 35:42.842
or you will walk back to East Anglia.

35:43.002 --> 35:46.522
Then I'll send for 200 ships
and hope they arrive before we starve.

35:46.722 --> 35:49.442
- One month is not enough.
- That is my limit.

35:49.642 --> 35:52.282
You cannot take back the fortress.
You know this.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.842
Food and ale for one month,
no more.

35:55.042 --> 35:58.242
By which time,
the sea storms will have arrived.

35:58.442 --> 36:02.442
- God's storms.
- We will be gone within a month,

36:02.882 --> 36:05.682
beginning upon
the delivery of food and ale.

36:16.362 --> 36:19.562
Uhtred, you will come to me
following prayers.

36:19.722 --> 36:22.882
- Yes, Lord.
- Father Selbix, you will pray with me.

36:23.042 --> 36:24.802
Yes, Lord.

36:28.922 --> 36:30.762
(ALFRED) Please sit.

36:34.642 --> 36:36.282
Thank you, Lord.

36:38.682 --> 36:41.642
I have a task for you, Father.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.722
You only have to speak it.

36:45.522 --> 36:49.802
As a guarantee of the peace, you will
be given up as a hostage, one of ten.

36:50.202 --> 36:53.762
The Danes, too,
will give ten in exchange.

36:54.682 --> 36:56.122
(EXHALES)

36:56.322 --> 37:01.402
Lord, the pagans
do not value priests.

37:01.562 --> 37:03.882
You might just as well offer a hound.

37:04.082 --> 37:06.322
I hear Guthrum is curious
about our faith.

37:06.482 --> 37:09.242
I would like you
to become his teacher.

37:10.082 --> 37:12.202
Provide instruction.

37:13.442 --> 37:16.842
And if he refuses to be a student?

37:17.562 --> 37:19.002
Then persist.

37:19.162 --> 37:23.082
Gently with humour,
as is your manner.

37:25.002 --> 37:26.402
Make no mistake...

37:28.042 --> 37:32.402
...sh0uld Guthrum
ever consent to being baptised,

37:32.682 --> 37:34.882
then this war is over.

37:35.042 --> 37:37.242
England is ours.

37:40.082 --> 37:42.962
This would be
truly God's work you do.

37:44.642 --> 37:46.642
Forgive me, Lord,

37:47.042 --> 37:49.922
but I cannot help but feel afraid.

37:50.962 --> 37:54.322
They are not content
to simply kill a priest.

37:55.682 --> 37:59.002
Fear is within all of us.

38:00.482 --> 38:02.562
As is strength.

38:04.722 --> 38:06.682
(SPITTING AND GASPING)

38:32.322 --> 38:35.762
Lord, I'd be more useful as a warrior
for when the truce fails.

38:35.922 --> 38:38.122
Oh, the truce will hold for a time.

38:38.282 --> 38:41.882
And in that time, you will be
my eyes and ears inside the fortress.

38:42.042 --> 38:44.482
- Listening for what?
- For Ubba.

38:44.642 --> 38:48.082
If and when you hear of his return,
you will escape.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.722
- And if I'm in chains?
- Our men shall disband.

38:50.882 --> 38:52.202
There are fields to work.

38:52.362 --> 38:55.842
I'll build a beacon on the hill.
You'll escape and light the fire.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.962
Lord, you know that escape
will be near impossible.

38:59.122 --> 39:03.562
If Ubba returns, the hostages
will be killed and the Danes will attack.

39:03.722 --> 39:05.642
Upon sight of this beacon being lit,

39:05.802 --> 39:08.602
other fires will start.
Wessex will be called to arms.

39:08.762 --> 39:12.522
- If I refuse to become a hostage?
- Another man shall light the beacon.

39:12.682 --> 39:14.322
Why can't you accept me?

39:14.482 --> 39:17.922
I've been nothing but truthful.
Why am I always put to the test?

39:18.082 --> 39:20.682
Why do you not show your king
respect that is due?

39:20.842 --> 39:22.522
Because you, Uhtred of wherever,

39:22.682 --> 39:26.522
you do not see me as your king.
You do not see my god as your god.

39:26.682 --> 39:28.962
- My Lord'?
- I am not finished with you yet.

39:31.842 --> 39:34.802
Guthrum is waiting to hear
of Ubba's return from Ireland.

39:34.962 --> 39:39.482
I need to know when this occurs,
sooner rather than later. You...

39:40.202 --> 39:44.842
...are the only man who could possibly
provide this information sooner.

39:45.442 --> 39:47.602
Yes, it is possible that you will die,

39:47.802 --> 39:51.522
but it is likely that we shall all die.

39:53.282 --> 39:55.602
You will go to the Danes.

39:55.882 --> 39:57.842
How you go, as a Saxon hostage

39:58.002 --> 40:00.762
or as a Viking warrior,
becomes your choice.

40:06.602 --> 40:08.562
I'll do as you ask.

40:11.602 --> 40:15.522
But if my child is born while
I'm captive, I ask that you send word.

40:15.722 --> 40:17.282
Of course.

40:17.682 --> 40:22.082
And should you die as a captive, rest
assured, your debt shall die with you.

40:35.922 --> 40:37.802
Will they treat us well?

40:37.962 --> 40:39.882
You are one of them.

40:40.882 --> 40:43.722
If I am one of them,
then why am I a hostage?

40:44.522 --> 40:47.482
They'll treat us well
for as long as the truce holds.

40:47.642 --> 40:50.162
- If it fails?
- They'll kill us all,

40:50.362 --> 40:52.602
starting with the priest. Heh!

40:53.882 --> 40:56.482
I've made my peace. I am ready.

40:56.842 --> 40:59.922
Good evening and God bless you all.

41:00.882 --> 41:02.362
Poor wretches.

41:02.562 --> 41:04.202
And us, Father, what are we?

41:04.362 --> 41:06.762
We are fortunate, Lord.
We know God.

41:07.202 --> 41:10.282
Although granted,
I'm in no hurry to meet him.

41:10.442 --> 41:12.522
Let us pray he feels the same.

41:12.682 --> 41:14.322
(MAN) Amen.

41:50.722 --> 41:53.682
(GUTHRUM) Enough. Enough!

41:55.202 --> 41:57.522
They are our guests for a while.

41:58.162 --> 42:00.362
There's one rule only.

42:01.282 --> 42:03.082
At nightfall,

42:03.242 --> 42:05.962
you will gather and sleep
at the church.

42:06.122 --> 42:08.202
The doors will be barred.

42:08.882 --> 42:15.082
At daybreak, you will then be free to
walk, talk, jump, hump, carry weapons.

42:15.482 --> 42:18.562
My men have orders not to kill you...

42:19.562 --> 42:22.442
...unless you deserve to be killed.

42:26.642 --> 42:28.242
I am Guthrum.

42:28.402 --> 42:31.202
And one day, I shall be your king.

42:31.402 --> 42:33.602
Do you understand
what I have said?

42:33.802 --> 42:35.522
You will all say, "Yes, Lord."

42:37.322 --> 42:39.082
Yes, Lord.

42:39.242 --> 42:41.202
I did not hear you.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.282
I understand you, Lord.

42:49.162 --> 42:51.442
Maybe I will make
a present of you to Ubba.

42:51.642 --> 42:55.562
- Should he ever return from Ireland.
- He may not. That's possible.

42:55.762 --> 42:58.122
But then his men
will become my men,

42:58.282 --> 43:01.642
and I will honour him
by killing you myself.

43:03.282 --> 43:05.602
With arrows, perhaps.

43:05.762 --> 43:08.202
- Ragnar Ragnarson.
- (RAGNAR) Here.

43:08.362 --> 43:11.202
You know this one well.
Keep him out of my sight.

43:11.362 --> 43:14.282
Take them to the church. Feed them.

43:21.562 --> 43:23.722
Now you are where you belong.

43:24.242 --> 43:25.682
Now I'm with my brother.

43:25.842 --> 43:30.082
I will remind you what it is like
to be a Dane and make you stay.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.762
Brida's here.

43:51.162 --> 43:53.882
I dream about you, vixen.

43:55.442 --> 43:57.722
I'm not surprised to hear it.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.682
You've grown up. Heh, heh.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.962
You should know I'm with Ragnar now.
He's my man.

44:09.282 --> 44:10.922
That's good.

- You have grown up.
- He's married?

Yes, he is married.

We must.

- I need to be inside the church.
- No, tonight we get drunk.

44:38.482 --> 44:40.362
I'll take you to the church myself.

44:40.522 --> 44:43.682

...we must talk of the future.

- Is she beautiful?
- Mm.

Yes, she is beautiful.

in Wessex.

You have land given to you by Alfred.

Your wife carries your child.

47:07.402 --> 47:11.002
And yet you're given up
as a hostage by Alfred?

47:11.522 --> 47:13.722
Are you a spy, Uhtred?

47:17.362 --> 47:20.242
At the first sign of Ubba returning,
I am to escape.

47:22.282 --> 47:26.202
But I know that when Ubba returns,
the hostages will be killed.

47:27.282 --> 47:29.402
Alfred's not fond of me.

47:29.602 --> 47:31.322

47:39.442 --> 47:42.642
Not that it matters, but I should ask.

Is it a problem to you
that Brida's with me now?

47:47.722 --> 47:50.842
Ha, ha, no. I'm happy about it.

47:52.162 --> 47:53.962
- I swear.
- All right.

47:54.122 --> 47:56.682

- And with my permission.
- I know.

- Soon, I'm told.

50:06.362 --> 50:08.082
It does.

50:09.442 --> 50:12.642
Still, at least we're alive to feel it.

50:14.042 --> 50:16.122
How are your conversations
with Guthrum?

50:16.922 --> 50:18.562
Is he a Christian yet?

50:18.722 --> 50:21.802
I believe the time is near, I do.

50:21.962 --> 50:26.042
I often leave him
to contemplate alone in church.

50:26.202 --> 50:30.322
Guthrum likes to contemplate
war and kingdoms.

50:30.522 --> 50:33.162
The kingdom of heaven
is his to share.

50:33.882 --> 50:35.522
I've told him.

50:37.042 --> 50:38.842
A man can change, Uhtred.

50:42.922 --> 50:44.802
Onward. God bless you.

50:45.282 --> 50:46.842
MaY YOU enjoy a good day.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.802
Thank you, Father.

50:49.762 --> 50:53.322
He is the king of kings.

50:53.602 --> 50:56.282
Capable of great, great things.

50:56.442 --> 50:58.122
Such as what?

50:58.762 --> 51:00.802
Such as miracles.

51:01.402 --> 51:03.082
Miracles?

51:03.402 --> 51:05.162
Such as what?

51:05.682 --> 51:09.922
Such as you, Lord.

51:10.602 --> 51:12.842
You are a miracle.

51:14.282 --> 51:18.362
He has made you
strong yet merciful.

51:18.922 --> 51:20.842
He has...

51:21.602 --> 51:24.602
...made you proud yet humble.

51:25.562 --> 51:27.802
He has made you eager to learn.

51:29.202 --> 51:31.282
He has given you free will,

51:31.442 --> 51:36.162
hoping that you will find the courage
to choose him above all else.

51:36.522 --> 51:40.282
And I believe, I truly believe,

51:40.442 --> 51:42.602
he will be rewarded.

51:42.802 --> 51:44.802
(GATE OPENS)

51:49.202 --> 51:52.442
- I have a message for Guthrum.
- He's in the church.

52:07.722 --> 52:10.802
- Lord, may I speak?
- Freely.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.682
Ubba and his army
have returned from Ireland.

52:13.842 --> 52:16.802
They are coming ashore
north of here at the Severn.

52:17.002 --> 52:19.002
And my fleet is where?

52:19.202 --> 52:22.202
They left Lundene several days ago
and are nearly here.

52:22.362 --> 52:25.442
Every last ship will be here.
Every man will be with you.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.482
That is good news.

52:31.122 --> 52:32.442
(SELBIX GRUNTS)

52:32.602 --> 52:34.482
I dispatch you to your heaven.

52:34.642 --> 52:36.522
(GASPING)

52:37.922 --> 52:40.042
No need to thank me.

52:53.562 --> 52:55.962
(SELBIX PANTING)

52:56.162 --> 52:57.802
(UHTRED) Father.

52:58.962 --> 53:01.002
Ubba has returned?

53:01.162 --> 53:02.882
Did they say?

53:05.002 --> 53:06.682
Yes.

53:08.362 --> 53:10.962
(GUTHRUM) Men, the peace is over.

53:11.122 --> 53:13.362
Prepare for battle.

53:13.722 --> 53:16.202
(MEN SHOUTING)

53:21.922 --> 53:25.322
The Saxon hostages, kill them all.

53:25.482 --> 53:27.442
(ALL GRUNTING)

53:27.762 --> 53:30.122
- (GUTHRUM) Catch him!
- (MAN) Get him.

53:30.562 --> 53:32.882
(GUTHRUM) Cut him to pieces!

53:35.242 --> 53:37.242
(GUTHRUM) Kill him!

53:38.122 --> 53:40.842
(ALL SHOUTING AND GRUNTING)

53:50.562 --> 53:52.602
(YELLS)

53:54.642 --> 53:56.042
(RAGNAR) Leave him.

53:56.242 --> 53:58.762
I say leave him!

53:59.642 --> 54:01.322
(GUTHRUM) Ragnar.

54:02.282 --> 54:05.002
Please step aside.

54:05.882 --> 54:08.002
You know all of the hostages
have to die.

54:09.002 --> 54:10.522
(RAGNAR) Then kill him.

54:10.682 --> 54:13.722
You're welcome to kill him.
But you have to kill me first.

54:14.122 --> 54:16.322
I could happily manage without this.

54:17.802 --> 54:21.562
He's a Saxon. He's a traitor.
He's an enemy.

54:22.242 --> 54:24.682
Well, to get to him,
you have to kill me.

54:26.482 --> 54:29.642
My men, they will not follow you.

54:41.322 --> 54:43.882
I will give you one last charity.

54:45.042 --> 54:47.402
Release him without a horse.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.802
Are you all right?

55:00.762 --> 55:02.322
I have no words.

55:02.522 --> 55:05.362
You should go.
Go and see your child. Go.

55:08.922 --> 55:10.442
(UHTRED) Yes.

55:10.842 --> 55:12.722
I'll be with you.

55:14.162 --> 55:15.962
Both of you.
