"We are now about to penetrate

00:52.252 --> 00:53.518
a country

00:53.520 --> 00:56.121
on which the foot
of civilized man

00:56.123 --> 00:57.355
has never trod.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.696
The good or evil
it has in store for us

01:04.697 --> 01:06.331
has yet to be determined.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.672
We carry every article
by which we are to survive.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.511
The party are in excellent
health and spirits."

01:21.682 --> 01:24.049
"Zealously attached
to the enterprise

01:24.051 --> 01:25.216
and anxious to proceed."

01:26.720 --> 01:30.956
"Entertaining, as I do,
the most confident hopes

01:30.958 --> 01:33.258
I could but esteem
this moment of our departure"...

01:34.695 --> 01:36.661
...as among the most
happy of my life."

01:40.634 --> 01:44.002
From the journals
Of Lewis and Clark, 1805.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.342
So, David Zara
for William Clark.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.744
And can you tell us
how tall you are?

01:52.746 --> 01:55.513
Uh, as I can play any height.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.048
That's how good I am.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.483
You know, David, I gotta say,

01:58.485 --> 02:00.418
we're both huge
"Little genius" fans.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.120
Ah, man, huge.
We love it, love it.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.555
Cool, guys.
Yes, thank you.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.323
It was a long time ago,
but, you know.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.726
How did it go,
it was like, he's a...

02:10.163 --> 02:12.497
- Oh, wow, wait.
And the catchphrase...

02:12.499 --> 02:14.232
- "Does not compute."
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.102
- "That does not compute."
- Okay.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.704
No, that was the, um,
the robot... "Little genius"

02:19.706 --> 02:21.439
- who said that.
- Oh.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.742
But I was like the
straight man, like, "awe.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.210
You know?

02:25.212 --> 02:27.245
Um, I don't remember that.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.580
Hey, well,
should we get started?

02:28.582 --> 02:29.614
Surely.

02:29.616 --> 02:33.351
Pacific. Pacific.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.040
Meriwether?

02:57.411 --> 02:59.411
Meriwether,
Stop paddling. Yon.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.715
It's the Pacific!

03:06.553 --> 03:08.686
It's the Pacific at last!

03:38.785 --> 03:40.251
Hi, this is David.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.553
I can't come to
the phone right now

03:41.555 --> 03:43.354
Because I am on my honeymoon.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.756
Call you in a week
when I get back.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.758
- Hi David, it's Fula,

03:46.760 --> 03:48.226
Your BFF forever.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.128
I hope you're doing okay.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.564
I know probably
the answer is "Not okay,"

03:52.566 --> 03:54.099
but don't worry.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.234
Your best man
is coming to cheer you up.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.472
Get ready for a nice gassy ball.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.640
It will make sense
in just some seconds.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.642
Bye-bye.

04:14.554 --> 04:17.355
Good morning, David.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.423
Hey.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.860
Okay.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.266
Look who's here
to brighten your day.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.506
No?

04:34.508 --> 04:36.341
These rays have no effect?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.278
Here, have a bottle.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.747
Ooh, Rose.
I like it.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.215
Frankie cancels the wedding.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.550
She takes all of the furniture,

04:45.552 --> 04:47.185
but on the bright side,

04:47.187 --> 04:49.754
I have a lifetime
supply of Rose.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.356
Things are looking up.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.661
- What are you wearing?
- What am I wearing?

04:56.663 --> 04:58.863
David, what are you wearing?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.566
You look like kangaroo.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.934
You know marsupials

05:02.936 --> 05:04.569
actually travel
in pairs, though.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.744
"From the pen of William Clark.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.482
Every great journey,
like a giant redwood

05:17.484 --> 05:21.319
begins, initially,
as a small seed.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.589
On the day my old friend,
Meriwether Lewis came to visit,

05:24.591 --> 05:26.457
I was entirely unaware
that he had come

05:26.459 --> 05:28.493
to plant this very seed

05:28.495 --> 05:29.861
into my life."

05:29.863 --> 05:33.231
David, we need to
get you outside.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.266
You've been in here for like,
what, a week?

05:35.268 --> 05:37.235
You need some sun on your face

05:37.237 --> 05:39.237
and your body, your legs, torso.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.906
We were gonna start
our honeymoon today.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.410
One week hike
would've been very romantic.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.746
It's too late
to return all this gear.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.849
- Did you cancel it?
- No.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.519
You're outside,
are you like just in the forest

05:54.521 --> 05:56.988
and nature with someone
you like and care about?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.823
Yeah, it just would've been

05:58.825 --> 06:00.391
Me and Frankie out there.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.694
But Frankie's not available.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.229
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Flula.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.563
- Thank you.
- No, I'm just saying,

06:05.565 --> 06:07.332
sounds like a trip
that is not cancelled

06:07.334 --> 06:10.635
and that it would be nice
to maybe have companionship

06:10.637 --> 06:13.004
on this wonderful journey.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.673
Mm.
It would've been.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.342
David.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.776
What did Rudy do

06:18.778 --> 06:20.612
when he could not make the sack?

06:22.849 --> 06:25.016
"Rudy," the football movie?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.652
Exactly. "Rudy."
You are Rudy.

06:27.654 --> 06:31.522
And these opponents,
the enemy team, and the people.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.858
This is like Frankie
and the wedding cancel

06:33.860 --> 06:35.660
and all the sad times
in your life.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.662
You are there on the field
and you're like,

06:37.664 --> 06:40.298
"What the... help! I would like
to make a sack, perhaps."

06:40.300 --> 06:42.867
Nobody can see you.
You are tiny.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.869
But do not worry, David...
I mean, Rudy,

06:44.871 --> 06:46.904
You have friends.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.606
You have the other
players on the team,

06:48.608 --> 06:50.742
The tall boyfriends
with the jerseys and numbers.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.410
This is me.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.578
And the crowd who cheer for you?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.580
Rudy! Rudy!

06:55.582 --> 06:58.650
Rudy!
This is me, also.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.752
And I'm the grasses and the sky.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.954
I'm... I'm all of these things, David.
I'm helping you out.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.722
You'll win the championship.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.424
And I will help you, Rudy.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.725
Let's do it.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.363
Yeah, so, wait.
You want... what're you saying?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.999
We are going to go
on your honeymoon together.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.803
- No, no.
- N, this is great, David.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.072
- Awful.
- No, we're doing this.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.375
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

07:24.377 --> 07:25.643
Rudy.

07:25.645 --> 07:29.314
Rudy. Rudy. Rudy.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.648
- What?
- Rudy.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.983
- Rudy.
- Rudy.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.104
Okay, David.
So this is my first honeymoon.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.639
Tell me, what will we do?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.807
Well, it's gonna be

07:55.809 --> 07:58.076
Seven days, seven nights,

07:58.078 --> 07:59.677
hike through the wilderness,

07:59.679 --> 08:01.746
gorgeous vistas,
rugged overlooks.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.614
That sounds amazing, David.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.117
And on the last day,
there's a special treat.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.486
One night in the big piney

08:08.488 --> 08:09.821
wilderness lodge.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.490
Ooh, sounds very romantic.

08:13.626 --> 08:14.959
Yeah, that's...

08:14.961 --> 08:16.961
kinda the weird thing
about this.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.496
How many beds?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.064
One bed.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.767
But I'm sure they will bring
a cot in or something.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.035
Uh! Got you!

08:24.037 --> 08:25.937
Okay, so we will
"cot" the bed in half

08:25.939 --> 08:28.773
- To make two beds?
- No... god, no, no!

08:28.775 --> 08:31.776
A cot is like a smaller bed

08:31.778 --> 08:34.578
that they can lend us
in addition to the one bed.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.547
So we'll have three beds?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.049
Fair enough.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.501
David, I've heard there are
magical creatures

08:56.503 --> 08:58.102
- In this forest?
- No, there are not.

08:58.104 --> 09:01.472
Yeah, like yetis
and leprechauns, werewolves.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.441
The Sasquatch.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.643
Okay, I'll tell you right now
that does not exist.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.645
I've seen photos of Sasquatch.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.047
Well, I've seen photos
of Godzilla.

09:11.684 --> 09:12.884
Have you seen "Die hard 2"?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.186
I have not seen
"Die hard 2."

09:15.188 --> 09:18.189
So maybe the film doesn't exist.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.490
Yeah.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.710
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hello?

09:39.712 --> 09:42.947
Shut up.
You're kidding me.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.049
You know, I will have
my phone on me all week.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.051
I'm reachable.
Okay, bye.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.986
Woo hoo hoo!
That was my agent.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.988
- Yeah?
- Okay, I went in

09:50.990 --> 09:53.124
For this Lewis and Clark
bio pic for William Clark.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.660
They really like me,
and I'm gonna find out

09:55.662 --> 09:58.529
- in the next couple of days.
- Oh, David, I'm so happy.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.067
You... you think
I'll get reception, right?

10:03.069 --> 10:04.936
- Oh, in the forest?
- Yeah.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.737
N-no.
No, no.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.007
We're in the Boonie-docks
right now.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.749
- You ready?
- Yeah.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.651
I entered us
in the registry, David.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.020
This way, if a Sasquatch
or something eats us,

10:23.022 --> 10:24.922
our parents will find
our limbs okay.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.758
That's a good idea.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.194
- Haha! Let's do this!
- Oh, yeah.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.029
Bound it, David.
Bound it.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.203
Ho-hoo!

10:39.205 --> 10:40.738
- Are you looking at this, Flula?
- I see it, David.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.939
- What did I tell you?
- I love it.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.141
Exactly what I needed.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.678
This is my therapy.
My antidepressant.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.180
Suck it in, David, Suck it in.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.882
What does it bring to mind
for you?

10:50.884 --> 10:53.651
It's like heaven,
but with real trees.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.887
This is the greatest thing.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.601
"The wooded country,

11:10.603 --> 11:12.603
through which we now pass

11:12.605 --> 11:14.972
is the most rugged
and most beautiful

11:14.974 --> 11:16.207
I have ever seen.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.946
But this beauty belies surely
belies some unknown danger.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.714
I am no coward, but I fear

11:23.716 --> 11:27.051
that not all will make
it across the continent.

11:27.053 --> 11:29.954
But for now,
all are in good spirits.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.024
Not a whisper of discontent
can be heard among the men.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.992
We act in unison

11:34.994 --> 11:36.794
with the most
perfect harmony."

11:39.165 --> 11:41.699
Okay.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.868
David, can we increase
our pace a bit?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.036
Oh, god.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.072
Hey, David, We're slowing down.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.041
Move those tiny legs.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.979
Good god.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.116
Whoa.
What's the altitude here?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.126
Wow, these, uh...

12:09.128 --> 12:10.695
These packs Are heavy, huh?

12:10.697 --> 12:13.030
- No, not really.
- Pretty light.

12:13.032 --> 12:16.200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just, uh...

12:16.202 --> 12:19.236
Think that morning bottle of
Rose is catching up to me.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.205
That was a bad idea.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.741
Let's sweat it out.
Come.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.910
Just push out that Rose,

12:25.912 --> 12:28.746
Push it out your pores, David.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.081
- David?
- Oh, my god.

13:10.089 --> 13:11.956
- Oh, my god.
- Don't let the trail hike you.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.257
You must hike the trail, David.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.026
Come.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.727
Haha-hah!

13:16.729 --> 13:17.995
Yeah!

13:24.437 --> 13:26.070
Feel it in your lungs, David.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.240
My legs are tingling.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.112
Oh, nature.
You're so refreshing.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.814
You're like an Arnold Palmer.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.949
You're like a cigarette.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.219
But not filled with nicotine,
you're filled with...

13:42.221 --> 13:44.422
Nature.
Woo ahh!

13:44.424 --> 13:46.123
I can't feel my butt.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.760
Ah haha hah!

13:49.762 --> 13:52.229
Nature, I suck you in.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.307
Oh, my god.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.938
I can't feel my toes,
which I understand,

14:33.940 --> 14:37.341
But I can't feel my fingers,
which scares me.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.313
How far
did we walk today, David?

14:46.452 --> 14:49.120
We walked two point...

14:51.023 --> 14:53.357
Just two miles.

14:53.359 --> 14:57.128
How many more miles remain?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.462
84.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.102
I think we need to walk faster.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.169
Yeah, okay.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.871
All right, David.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.272
We are ready for a hike.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.278
Oh, David,
Do you know how like, when...

16:21.280 --> 16:23.047
When small things
you carry them,

16:23.049 --> 16:25.516
They help you move faster
more nimble like a leopard?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.184
Let me show you a trick
from my father

16:27.186 --> 16:29.620
I learned on a Volksmarch.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.988
- Here.
- Okay.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.490
Yeah, here we go.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.227
- Ugh. Yeah. Siest Du?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.062
You've beheaded my toothbrush.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.464
Now it's six grams lighter,
approximate.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.033
What do I do with the other
95 percent of it?

16:43.035 --> 16:45.636
Oh, you will carry that in your
pocket until we find a trashcan.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.071
- Yeah, yeah, that's, uh...
- Excellent.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.573
Then you will move faster, yes?

16:49.575 --> 16:52.142
Going on a hike
with my friend David.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.144
Who is right behind me for sure.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.180
Oh, look, I found...
I found a pyramid

16:56.182 --> 16:58.082
- Or something interesting.
- Okay, wait up.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.251
You should see it.
It's disappearing quick.

17:05.424 --> 17:09.026
There's so many great
Sounds here, David.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.228
"One of our great tasks

17:11.230 --> 17:12.596
is to record native specimens

17:12.598 --> 17:15.598
in this new part
of the continent."

17:15.601 --> 17:19.136
Note, record leaf slaps.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.138
"Meriwether has taken
a keen interest in this.

17:22.141 --> 17:26.042
Even employing a special
apparatus in these pursuits."

17:26.045 --> 17:29.480
It's photosynthesizing.
Right now.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.916
"I too have joined Meriwether
in this endeavor."

17:31.918 --> 17:33.350
- It's gross.
- Ah.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.253
Record more photosynthesis
for my synthesizer.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.455
"And I am eager to assist
in the process."

17:38.457 --> 17:40.157
What're you doing, man?

17:40.159 --> 17:41.392
I'm recording sounds
for this song.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.127
What song?

17:43.129 --> 17:45.496
It's the greatest song
that I've ever written.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.364
Uh, I see it has not been
written yet.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.500
Well, that's what's now is for.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.305
Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.006
- Do that again. No.
- What?

17:56.008 --> 17:57.508
- Back, back.
- What?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.677
Like, shh, like this,
just go like this.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.445
- Why don't you just do it?
- You do it.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.215
Again.
More.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.650
- What is happening?
- Shh!

18:08.220 --> 18:09.486
"Though his methodology

18:09.488 --> 18:10.621
is sometimes perplexing"...

18:15.227 --> 18:18.095
"Wind tree blow."
record tomorrow.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.597
"I have no doubt that
the president

18:20.599 --> 18:24.368
- and future generations of scholars"...
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.704
..."Will be much delighted
with our new discoveries."

18:30.009 --> 18:32.443
- This is perfect c-minor.
- Mm.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.044
- You know?
- Yeah.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.013
I pee in the key
of c-minor.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.314
You do?

18:37.316 --> 18:39.750
In a standard toilet, or course.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.452
We'll record that later.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.506
Can you pass me the gorp?

19:37.309 --> 19:39.476
- Sorry, what?
- The gorp.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.078
- The gorp?
- The gorp.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.112
- Gorp?
- The gorp.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.447
- The gorp?
- Gorp.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.283
- What's this?
- It stands for, um...

19:48.487 --> 19:50.387
It's...

19:50.389 --> 19:51.555
Can I have the trail mix?

19:51.557 --> 19:53.590
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.359
That was right there.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.531
You know, Flula,

20:00.533 --> 20:03.133
Lewis and Clark hiked through
here over 200 years ago.

20:03.135 --> 20:06.236
Coulda...
slept right here.

20:06.238 --> 20:10.307
This is gonna be good research
if I get the part.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.609
Do you think Lewis
urinated on that tree?

20:12.611 --> 20:13.844
That tree?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.512
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.648
But if they camped here,
you know, to leave the tent

20:17.650 --> 20:18.782
- And then...
- Allow me for a second.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.717
Clark had a slave Named York

20:20.719 --> 20:23.087
Who did the entire
journey with them.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.723
York actually saved Meriweather
Lewis from a grizzly attack,

20:26.725 --> 20:30.327
He was revered as a brave
and... and giant of a man

20:30.329 --> 20:32.529
by the local Indian tribes.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.432
At the end of the journey,
Clark whipped York

20:35.434 --> 20:38.535
For not wanting to
go back as a slave.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.737
- What?
- Awful.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.539
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, it's depressing part of the script,

20:42.541 --> 20:44.608
And I'm trying to have them
tweak the ending.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.244
I have an idea. Doing some work on
Clark, Clark wouldn't say that.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.379
Clark would say something like,
uh, I love you.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.650
You did it with us.
I set you free.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.686
- Go have a life.
- Go, be free.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.521
That's my take.
Just go.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.390
- I like that, David.
- Thank you.

21:00.392 --> 21:03.260
- Do you know another thing I like?
- What's that?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.828
Fast lunches and hard hikes.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.296
Oh, you're done.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.599
David, I'm fighting time.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.802
In 60 years,
I'll be dust and molecules.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.370
- Wow.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.872
So, suck it, time.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.440
I'm gonna hike
on your face. Right?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.876
I'll take my break when we hike.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.446
The young bird gets, uh...
Gets all the worms.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.848
Means a tardy bird just... ugh,

21:24.850 --> 21:26.917
Eats gravel or, you know,

21:26.919 --> 21:28.719
sand.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.788
Other worms that are dead
and smell bad.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.193
Come on, David!

21:57.349 --> 21:59.850
Look, David, a human.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.319
- Hey, there!
- Uh! Jeez.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.454
God! Jeez!

22:04.456 --> 22:06.757
You guys just scared me so much.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.359
I haven't seen somebody
in a long time.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.894
Hey, what're you guys
doing out here?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.430
- Oh, we are on a honeymoon.
- Oh.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.199
That's awesome!
Congratulations.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.733
We're... he...
We're on my honeymoon.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.702
He's coming along with me
on my honeymoon, so...

22:18.704 --> 22:21.672
- Have a wonderful life together.
- Let's be clear... friends.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.874
- We are honey-buddies. - You guys
are gonna make a beautiful family.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.209
You're gonna have kids, right?

22:25.211 --> 22:26.543
- Yes.
- Awesome.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.412
- With other people.
- Mazel Tov.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.780
- Thank you.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.548
I'm really happy for you guys.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.884
Seriously.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.519
Did you hear that?

22:35.521 --> 22:37.588
What is it?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.658
I can't hear anything.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.962
What're you hearing?

22:47.499 --> 22:49.633
It's gone.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.768
Is it Sasquatch?

22:51.770 --> 22:54.304
- Ah...
- Is it a minotaur?

22:54.306 --> 22:56.473
- Um...
- It's a yeti.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.877
We have two in Germany.

23:00.879 --> 23:04.414
Well, um, not... not to freak
you guys out or anything,

23:04.416 --> 23:06.750
But enjoy your time together.

23:06.752 --> 23:09.686
- Okay. -'Cause
there's these, um...

23:09.688 --> 23:11.421
There's wolves.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.860
Was that a wolf?

23:18.697 --> 23:21.431
Yeah. They're government
experiment wolves.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.601
Yeah, they're pumped with GMOs,

23:24.603 --> 23:27.271
and they are massive,
huge animals.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.440
They kill for pleasure
and their fangs are huge.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.609
And they leave their kill
so that you see it,

23:32.611 --> 23:36.980
so that you know that you are
the one that is being hunted.

23:36.982 --> 23:40.817
They've got these huge giant
Velociraptor claws.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.724
But, listen.

23:47.726 --> 23:49.393
Have a great honeymoon,

23:49.395 --> 23:51.395
Enjoy your time together.

23:51.397 --> 23:54.298
Just be cool, okay?

23:54.300 --> 23:55.799
Don't sweat...

23:55.801 --> 23:58.368
Because they smell the sweat.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.370
And, um, listen,
I'm gonna give you a... a...

24:00.372 --> 24:04.007
A honeymoon present
because I like you guys.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.609
They're really good.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.311
I grew 'em myself.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.613
I'm taking this
little family with me

24:09.615 --> 24:11.615
Because I watched them grow.

24:11.617 --> 24:15.819
There's Norberto and Regina.

24:15.821 --> 24:19.656
And, uh, Raul, and Sebastian...

24:19.658 --> 24:21.925
He's the youngest one
of the family.

24:21.927 --> 24:25.662
And they are... mm.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.498
So, listen.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.367
Enjoy your honeymoon.
Enjoy the hike.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.703
Enjoy mother nature.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.975
Hey, wait a second.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.112
"Little genius."
Jesus Christ, that's it.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.714
With the little robot guy.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.048
That was my favorite part.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.883
"Does not compute."

24:46.885 --> 24:49.453
"Does not compute.
It does not compute."

24:49.455 --> 24:51.955
- That was the robot's line.
- It does not compute.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.590
I was the boy next to the robot.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.560
He was the most human
part of that whole show.

24:56.562 --> 24:59.796
Yeah, everybody else
was more like robots.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.932
Thanks for being
part of my life.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.240
All right.

25:10.241 --> 25:11.507
That's terrifying
about the wolves, David.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.943
Oh, don't believe the wolves.

25:32.464 --> 25:35.665
David, I have a question
about your movie.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.868
I don't understand
what you were saying earlier

25:37.870 --> 25:40.437
about Superman owning a slave.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.872
- What?
- Well,

25:41.874 --> 25:44.841
We have Lewis and Clark...
Lewis loves Clark

25:44.843 --> 25:47.010
of course...
They're lovers,

25:47.012 --> 25:49.179
Clark is always
in the phone booth,

25:49.181 --> 25:52.182
and then he's superman,
so, why is he...

25:52.184 --> 25:54.017
Whoa, whoa, back up.

25:54.019 --> 25:58.822
Um, Lois and Clark Kent
are fictitious characters.

25:58.824 --> 26:01.558
Lewis and Clark
are actual explorers

26:01.560 --> 26:04.428
who explored this area.

26:04.430 --> 26:07.030
Okay, I... I don't
understand who is who,

26:07.032 --> 26:09.466
But I want to go on the
record and tell you

26:09.468 --> 26:11.501
That I am against slavery.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.702
So...

26:12.704 --> 26:14.204
if you get the role,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.640
I may not go to the premiere.

26:16.642 --> 26:19.509
I don't even know
where to start.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.178
How is he like...?
He's like super fast.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.712
Faster than a speeding bullet,

26:22.714 --> 26:24.181
more power
than a "Locomotion."

26:24.183 --> 26:25.749
Oh, yes, and he owns a slave,

26:25.751 --> 26:28.518
'cause he cannot
carry his knapsack?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.986
That's wrong, Superman.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.497
"My dearest love.

26:40.499 --> 26:44.768
I write to you from the
other side of the continent

26:44.770 --> 26:47.904
with no knowledge of when or if

26:47.906 --> 26:49.739
you will ever
receive these words."

26:51.910 --> 26:54.077
"I know that when
we last saw each other

26:54.079 --> 26:56.179
our hearts were heavy.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.048
And I pray this finds you
in better spirits

26:58.050 --> 26:59.749
living a life fulfilled.

27:03.989 --> 27:06.723
For me, this new endeavor

27:06.725 --> 27:08.692
has been a work
of staggering difficulty

27:08.694 --> 27:11.127
and, yet, the rewards are many,

27:11.129 --> 27:13.530
and we make great progress.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.567
I am lucky to travel with a man

27:17.569 --> 27:20.070
such as Meriwether...

27:20.072 --> 27:21.805
Uniquely qualified

27:21.807 --> 27:23.573
to lead this expedition.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.693
I was thinking this morning

27:43.695 --> 27:45.662
of the days we first
met in Kentucky

27:45.664 --> 27:48.098
and what a joyous time
that was."

27:49.668 --> 27:52.235
Ugh

27:52.237 --> 27:54.538
- Brilliant. That was a good one.
- Great.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.872
- That was a good one.
- Oh, good. I felt really good about it.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.008
You fooled the biker over there.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.910
- Yes.
- Play acting.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.745
So watch me do this to you.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.113
- Okay.
- Oh, Craig.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.148
Oh!
How did that... yeah?

28:05.150 --> 28:06.216
- Oh... boom!
- Oh!

28:06.218 --> 28:07.817
- Oh!
- Hah!

28:07.819 --> 28:09.653
Again. Don't do this
in a street fight.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.655
- Okay.
- Cause you won't make contact.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.189
- But this isn't good, right?
- No, it's just terrible.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.625
You don't want to telegraph it
in a street fight.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.961
You want to telegraph it
for the American viewer.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.030
- Right.
- Yeah, or whoever gets it abroad.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.033
You don't need that.
You need... boom!

28:23.035 --> 28:25.135
- Okay, I'm gonna do one more, okay?
- Okay, go for it.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.903
- Ow!
- Oh, my god!

28:26.905 --> 28:29.139
- Oh god, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm faking.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.840
- Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
- Wow!

28:30.842 --> 28:32.242
- That's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.077
You came so close
that you actually hit me.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.979
- That's how close you came.
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.114
- I really felt it that time.
- By the way, it doesn't hurt.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.783
- Oh, god.
- It's fine. It's fine.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.117
My eyes are only watering
'cause of my nose

28:41.119 --> 28:42.786
- is really sensitive.
- Oh, right.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.025
"I hope that someday
you will read this letter.

28:49.027 --> 28:52.362
And if somehow
I return home again,

28:52.364 --> 28:54.764
that our eyes
will meet once more.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.269
Yours, William Clark."

29:00.305 --> 29:02.872
Ah! David!

29:02.874 --> 29:04.774
Help, David!
I'm trapped!

29:04.776 --> 29:07.644
Ah! Oh, David!

29:07.646 --> 29:09.045
David, help!

29:10.682 --> 29:12.616
Help, David!

29:14.820 --> 29:15.986
Oh, god!

29:17.022 --> 29:19.756
David!
David, help!

29:19.758 --> 29:21.291
- Oh, my god!
- Rock hit me!

29:21.293 --> 29:22.792
- Oh, David!
- What happened?

29:22.794 --> 29:26.329
The rocks! The rocks!
I was recording a tone!

29:26.331 --> 29:28.398
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

29:28.400 --> 29:30.233
Ah!

29:30.235 --> 29:32.102
Dude, I'm getting no service.
We can't call out.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.404
- I don't know what to do.
- Pretend I'm like James Franco.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.006
I'll do... no, no, no, no!
I cannot cut you!

29:36.008 --> 29:37.774
- We have to cut it, David.
- Oh, no, no, no...

29:37.776 --> 29:40.110
- No, David, you have to cut it.
- I didn't want to do this.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.079
- This is my honeymoon!
- Cut it, David! I'm gonna die!

29:43.081 --> 29:45.749
David, you have to cut it.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.817
- Take it.
- Oh, my god.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.353
If we don't make it out, David,
send my arm to my dad.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.055
My father would like my arm.

29:52.057 --> 29:55.225
- Don't do the tendons.
- All right.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.893
- The tendons first.
- I need a countdown.

29:56.895 --> 29:58.995
- Three, two...
- No, no, but then what?

29:58.997 --> 30:01.698
- What?
- David! If anybody would cut my arm,

30:01.700 --> 30:03.900
I would want it
to be you, David.

30:03.902 --> 30:05.769
Oh man, I'm sorry, buddy.
Let's do this, ready?

30:05.771 --> 30:07.037
- One...
- Two...

30:07.039 --> 30:10.206
- Three!

30:13.211 --> 30:15.745
- David, a snack.
- Is that ketchup?

30:15.747 --> 30:18.248
- Do you have some fries?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.051
- Perhaps some hash browns.
- That was really elaborate.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.919
- Did I get you?
- You did get me.

30:22.921 --> 30:26.222
That is so bizarre that you
would go to that length.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.692
- You are a six-year-old-boy.
- Maybe seven.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.894
- It's going to be coming.
- I'm ready.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.796
That's my knife, by the way.

30:32.798 --> 30:33.930
Do you have a towel?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.317
I got reception!

31:02.160 --> 31:04.027
Reception's gone.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.862
David! Put down
your phone,

31:05.864 --> 31:07.330
And join me in these waters.

31:11.002 --> 31:14.337
Come take a freezing cold bath
with me, David. You will love it.

31:14.339 --> 31:17.474
Just ignore the shrinkage.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.476
David, I have goose
skin right now.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.745
It feels so good.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.748
Oh, hi, ducks.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.054
Hopin' for a signal.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.956
I need to know
if I got this part.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.758
Come, David.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.093
Increase your hip-moving velocity.
Let's go.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.429
And I have to talk To Frankie.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.232
Oh, David, stop it.
Focus your face on this nature.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.272
"It seems we are now beyond
reach of the known world.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.074
I think of those at home
who have no knowledge

31:51.076 --> 31:52.408
Of our well being."

31:52.410 --> 31:54.277
Nothing.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.379
"If we are alive or dead."

32:18.069 --> 32:20.303
Why do you think
Frankie contacted me?

32:20.305 --> 32:23.506
I mean, do you think that she
wants to move back in with me?

32:23.508 --> 32:25.909
I don't know, David.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.578
Okay, according to this map,

32:28.580 --> 32:30.580
We should go onto
the other side of this ridge,

32:30.582 --> 32:32.448
and there could be a
tower over there.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.450
We're surrounded
only by nature, David.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.820
I don't think beavers
can build cell phone towers.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.188
Well, the phone says otherwise.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.902
Nothing still.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.538
David, here. I'm slightly taller.
Let me try.

32:57.442 --> 32:58.975
Okay.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.314
Uh! A little higher.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.849
Yep. Here we go.

33:05.851 --> 33:09.085
All right, cell towers.
Smell this phone.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.420
Ha! We got it!

33:10.422 --> 33:11.521
- We got...
- Ah!

33:11.523 --> 33:13.489
Oh, god!

33:13.491 --> 33:15.158
Ugh!

33:17.128 --> 33:19.863
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, Scheibe.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.472
Yeah, it's completely fucked.

33:29.474 --> 33:32.041
I'm sorry, David.
Scheibe.

33:32.043 --> 33:34.043
Here.
Get your phone out.

33:34.045 --> 33:35.578
I didn't bring it.
It's in the car.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.247
I... I didn't think
we would have service.

33:39.117 --> 33:42.018
- The maps were in this phone.
- Uh, no, that's okay.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.453
Before it broke, I checked.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.989
We have to go to like a place
called Red Fox.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.490
Yeah.

33:47.492 --> 33:49.993
Well, do you know where that is?

33:49.995 --> 33:52.662
We'll find it for sure.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.099
How many Red Foxes
Are there, David? Right?

34:04.042 --> 34:06.142
Uh, I think it's Red Fox Hills.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.244
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Why... why... why is that?

34:08.246 --> 34:10.580
- It's in my guts.
- Uh, we're going with your guts now?

34:10.581 --> 34:12.581
That's how we're hiking?

34:12.583 --> 34:15.551
Well, what would
Lewis and Clark do?

34:15.553 --> 34:18.353
They would have used
a native American guide

34:18.356 --> 34:20.523
or a compass.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.190
Compass? Great.
Let's use that.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.194
Oh, good, yeah.
Uh, that was on my phone.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.463
So, do you have a guide?

34:27.465 --> 34:29.098
I don't have a guide.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.170
- Let's go that way.
- Let's do it.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.471
It's probably all the same.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.318
Come on, David.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.989
"When I first viewed
these mountains,

34:52.991 --> 34:55.558
I felt a sudden pleasure.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.361
But now, as I reflect
on the difficulties

34:58.363 --> 35:01.164
which this snowy barrier
throws in our way,

35:01.166 --> 35:05.034
and the sufferings
and hardships of our party,

35:05.036 --> 35:06.536
it in some measure
counterbalances

35:06.538 --> 35:08.371
those fond memories."

35:12.410 --> 35:14.744
And what are your guts
telling you now?

35:14.746 --> 35:17.347
I don't know.
My GPS is down, David.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.248
Oh, you have a GPS?

35:19.250 --> 35:21.017
Yeah.
My guts positioning system.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.020
It's not working
because I'm hungry.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.989
I think it needs a sandwich.

35:25.991 --> 35:29.192
"After narrowly avoiding
ruiness injury"...

35:30.762 --> 35:33.363
Come, David.

35:33.365 --> 35:37.567
..."We look to descending
from this retched mountain

35:37.569 --> 35:40.603
which we have now named,
'wretched mountain.'"

35:42.607 --> 35:46.476
Well, this was your idea
to do Red Fox Hills.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.144
Red Fox is an idiot.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.646
We call hills like this
in Germany mountains.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.518
"But we take joy in knowing
that tonight

35:55.520 --> 35:59.389
we shall bed at the last
outpost of civilization."

36:06.798 --> 36:08.431
I called my agent.

36:08.433 --> 36:09.799
It's between me
and one other guy.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.367
Oh, that's great.

36:13.304 --> 36:16.172
I called Frankie.
There was no answer.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.041
- Oh.
- But,

36:18.043 --> 36:19.475
I did pick up another map,

36:19.477 --> 36:21.811
and you are not
going to touch it.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.579
I will treat it like a baby
if I touch it.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.416
Listen, I mailed this
two weeks ago.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.152
It was supposed to be
for me and Frankie, but

36:29.154 --> 36:31.454
- Now it's for me and you.
- Ooh.

36:31.456 --> 36:32.822
Champagne.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.491
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, oatmeal-raisin mix.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.326
- Oh, condoms.
- We don't need those.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.762
- But who knows, David?
- Those were not meant for us.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.466
And it seems as though
you sent yourself a package.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.508
It means "Honeybuddies,"

36:52.510 --> 36:54.811
but in German.

36:56.314 --> 36:58.581
Oh, my god.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.349
- It's for you.
- That...

37:00.351 --> 37:02.385
is a very orange shirt.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.686
Yeah.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.555
I selected the color for safety.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.357
You know, like if hunters are
looking for elks or reindeers,

37:08.359 --> 37:10.159
who are we?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.761
Humans in shirts.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.229
This is ridiculous.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.398
Look on the left.
That's you.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.233
- Oh, slightly shorter.
- Well, it's accurate, yeah.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.135
- Oh, man, thank you.
- Oh, great.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.705
Look, okay.
I gotta be a grownup.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.607
I'm gonna put
the whole phone incident

37:24.609 --> 37:25.741
behind us.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.577
Okay, it was an accident.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.779
And honestly, it's kind of
a blessing in disguise.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.581
I... I'd rather not have
the outside world

37:31.583 --> 37:33.683
encroaching on this.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.518
Well, sorry again about that.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.652
Oh.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.723
This champagne's
not gonna drink itself.

37:40.725 --> 37:43.726
No, we are gonna do it.

37:43.728 --> 37:44.861
That's what you meant, right?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.395
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.502
Party pooper.

38:47.258 --> 38:50.259
David, we're empty.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.627
We need some more champagne.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.329
Let me get it.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.798
Ooh.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.810
"Dear David.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.513
I just found your
secret honeymoon package.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.516
And even though I'm probably
sitting right there next to you,

39:13.518 --> 39:15.518
I decided to write you
a little note.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.555
I wanted to just tell you
that I'm the luckiest person

39:19.557 --> 39:21.691
in the world
to have you in my life.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.661
I know things
haven't been easy lately,

39:25.663 --> 39:28.664
but I'm sure
it will all be worth it.

39:28.666 --> 39:32.635
I can't wait to spend the
rest of our lives together.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.371
Love you like crazy.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.472
Your new wife,

39:36.474 --> 39:38.507
Frankie."

39:41.646 --> 39:43.379
What are you doing, David?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.715
Oh, ah...

39:45.717 --> 39:49.018
Just getting another bottle.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.328
All right, David,
I'm going down the creek

39:59.330 --> 40:01.297
To get some cool river sounds.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.667
- Be careful.
- Okay.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.337
Come here, sounds.

40:16.914 --> 40:20.883
This is perfect.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.985
Take one of rock sounds.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.455
"Meriwether has once again

40:31.429 --> 40:33.079
left to capture
new specimens."

40:33.080 --> 40:35.480
Sometimes I worry what might
happen to him when he is alone."

40:48.713 --> 40:50.546
- Ah, Gottverdammt, Scheibe.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.964
This is what it is.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.003
Wer sind da?
Who's here?

41:20.345 --> 41:22.745
Verdammt noch mal, Du.

41:57.615 --> 41:58.981
Oh, god.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.519
Dude, it's me.
It's me. It's me.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.154
- David.
- I'm sorry, man.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.555
- You got me.
- I know,

42:06.557 --> 42:08.424
but the thing with the arm.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.960
So, we're even.
I'm so sorry.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.662
- Dude, are you okay?
- No.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.400
- Oh, David.
- Uh, we're even now, buddy.

42:17.402 --> 42:18.601
We are even Steven.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.102
Oh, I'm gonna get you so hard.

42:20.104 --> 42:22.805
Oh no, we're done.
You got me, and I got you back.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.807
No, it's my turn.
It's like a Frisbee.

42:24.809 --> 42:26.442
No, we can be done.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.730
"What drives men to do
such things?

42:48.866 --> 42:52.034
Are we full of courage?

42:52.036 --> 42:53.736
Are we mad?

42:55.706 --> 42:58.841
Or do we simply flee
what we've left behind?"

43:06.584 --> 43:07.817
What do you want me to say?

43:11.122 --> 43:13.489
It's not my fault
I didn't get the job.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.993
I'm actually okay with you
putting your career before me.

43:19.864 --> 43:22.932
What I have a problem with
is when you treat me like shit.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.951
So after he pulled out the
heart, you know, from that man,

43:41.953 --> 43:44.920
That's when I decided
I'm never visiting Indiana.

43:44.922 --> 43:47.022
Yeah, his name is Indiana Jones.

43:47.024 --> 43:48.524
That scene took place in India,

43:48.526 --> 43:50.092
and that was a movie.

43:50.094 --> 43:51.994
Well, I'm not going.
I don't care where it is.

43:51.996 --> 43:53.028
It's scary.

43:54.532 --> 43:56.532
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

43:56.534 --> 44:00.736
Let me guess. Uh, best friend
forever, David and DJ Flula.

44:00.738 --> 44:02.271
Yeah.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.273
I've been stalking you.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.675
I'm kidding.

44:06.677 --> 44:08.711
I saw your names
on the hiking registry.

44:08.713 --> 44:11.714
Ah-hah-hah! That's what you
put down in the registry?

44:11.716 --> 44:13.048
- Yeah, it's the truth.
- Okay.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.683
I guess we must've
passed you guys

44:14.685 --> 44:16.886
Yesterday at Red Fox Trail?

44:16.888 --> 44:19.889
Yes. We actually ended
up doing Red Fox Hills,

44:19.891 --> 44:21.891
Which was far less direct.

44:21.893 --> 44:23.792
- Very scenic.
- Cool.

44:23.794 --> 44:27.663
Well, did you guys wanna
stay with our group tonight?

44:27.665 --> 44:29.231
- We have backpacker beer.
- You bet.

44:29.233 --> 44:31.967
Heck, yes, hello.
Do bears poop in forests?

44:31.969 --> 44:33.636
- That sounds great. Sure.
- They do.

44:33.638 --> 44:35.971
Okay, awesome.
Um, well, there's a...

44:35.973 --> 44:38.140
There's a great spot, actually,
right over there.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.776
You guys wanna go grab it,
and I'll meet you there?

44:40.778 --> 44:42.945
- Great.
- Awesome.

44:42.947 --> 44:44.613
- Cool.
- Thanks.

44:44.615 --> 44:46.081
- BFF.
- Bye... bye-bye.

44:48.753 --> 44:51.921
David, she is very attractive.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.789
Yeah, I guess. If you're
into that sort of thing.

44:53.791 --> 44:56.058
What? No. She was
looking at you, David.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.593
No, she was looking
at both of us.

44:57.595 --> 45:00.262
No, she was looking at you.

45:00.264 --> 45:02.164
Stop thinking about Frankie
all the time.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.233
Start thinking about
hot new ladies.

45:32.663 --> 45:34.363
Okay.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.800
Oh, yeah, David.

45:37.802 --> 45:40.769
Yeah, get it.
Oh, yeah, looking good.

45:40.771 --> 45:42.271
Okay, so, tonight, just...

45:42.273 --> 45:44.106
You do some good things,
and I'll be your wingman.

45:44.108 --> 45:46.775
Oh, yeah, I do not need
a wingman tonight.

45:46.777 --> 45:49.011
- Thank you.
- You don't think you don't need one.

45:49.013 --> 45:50.846
- Right.
- But you do.

46:29.687 --> 46:30.886
Hello, everyone.

46:30.888 --> 46:33.055
I'm Flula and this is David.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.657
- Hi.
- I smell very bad,

46:34.659 --> 46:36.992
uh, but David smells
really great.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.193
So.

46:40.031 --> 46:42.765
Do you guys wanna learn
how to make backpacking beer?

46:42.767 --> 46:44.433
- Oh...
- Uh, yes, but,

46:44.435 --> 46:46.702
if this is a difficult
task, watch out.

46:46.704 --> 46:48.337
I am very stupid.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.806
But David, he's like a
scientist of the world.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.307
It's really easy.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.943
I... I... I'm sure you
both will be fine.

46:54.945 --> 46:56.445
Uh, this is some water...

46:56.447 --> 46:58.380
Naturally sourced,
that we then carbonated.

46:58.382 --> 46:59.782
Step one.

46:59.784 --> 47:02.117
And then,
here is the concentrate.

47:02.119 --> 47:04.820
It's just a teaspoon of this
into what you guys have.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.088
Just be careful 'cause it's like

47:06.090 --> 47:07.356
70 percent alcohol.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.024
- Ooh.
- Just be careful.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.326
That sounds like too many steps
for my small brain.

47:11.328 --> 47:14.163
I will probably
urinate everywhere.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.266
Also, I'm very terrible
with sexual intercourse.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.734
Just FYls.

47:18.736 --> 47:21.704
Do you know what that means?

47:25.042 --> 47:27.409
Uh, where are you from?

47:41.325 --> 47:43.492
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

47:43.494 --> 47:46.495
It was a, uh, tough time,

47:46.497 --> 47:48.297
But, uh,

47:48.299 --> 47:50.365
You know, whatever
doesn't kill you, right?

47:50.367 --> 47:52.334
No.
I mean,

47:52.336 --> 47:56.505
that is literally the saddest
thing I have ever heard.

47:56.507 --> 47:58.774
I don't know how you're just

47:58.776 --> 48:01.744
Keeping it together
like this right now.

48:01.746 --> 48:04.079
Yes, last week, David was crying

48:04.081 --> 48:06.148
- all day, just everyday.
- Tsk, oh.

48:06.150 --> 48:08.951
This week David's only crying
a few minutes every day.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.252
Yeah,

48:10.254 --> 48:12.020
It's because he's so manly.

48:12.022 --> 48:14.189
Unlike me, he's very
good at things like

48:14.191 --> 48:15.991
French kissing.

48:15.993 --> 48:17.326
Yeah, okay, thank you.

48:17.328 --> 48:19.828
Um, you sir, are the greatest

48:19.830 --> 48:21.830
best man you could ever want.

48:21.832 --> 48:24.333
He's also never done
a porno film.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.902
But he's received many offers.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.837
That's very flattering.

48:28.839 --> 48:32.441
Uh, well, Flula,
you were the best man.

48:32.443 --> 48:34.343
- Did you write a speech?
- Yes, I have it here.

48:34.345 --> 48:35.944
- You do?
- Yeah.

48:35.946 --> 48:37.913
That's amazing.
You... you have to...

48:37.915 --> 48:39.481
You have to say it.
You have to give the speech.

48:39.483 --> 48:41.016
- Yeah?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not now.

48:41.018 --> 48:42.351
- Yes. Yes.
- How 'bout a little later?

48:42.353 --> 48:43.919
- Speech, speech.
- No, don't start.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.554
- Don't start.
- Speech. Speech.

48:45.556 --> 48:48.390
- Guys, no! It's stupid.
- Speech. Speech...

48:48.392 --> 48:51.126
Yes! Hey!

48:52.396 --> 48:54.129
"Hello everyone.

48:54.131 --> 48:58.000
What a wonderful location
for a wedding like this...

48:58.002 --> 49:01.003
This great golf course
we're on tonight.

49:01.005 --> 49:06.175
You guys are all such
sexy 'motherputters.'

49:06.177 --> 49:07.843
Four!"

49:11.549 --> 49:12.848
Okay.

49:12.850 --> 49:15.184
"David, Frankie...

49:15.186 --> 49:17.519
David, ladies, gentlemen,

49:17.521 --> 49:20.255
and all the attenders
of this great event,

49:20.257 --> 49:23.025
hello to you and thank
you for your presence

49:23.027 --> 49:25.561
and also, your presents.

49:25.563 --> 49:28.964
Oh, look at that one
with the nice stripes and bows.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.433
Oh, what is it?
Perhaps a crock pot?

49:31.435 --> 49:33.035
Or a lawn mower?

49:35.105 --> 49:36.972
A question for you.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.208
Who is a lucky person?

49:39.210 --> 49:41.910
Is it a small baby child
who is born

49:41.912 --> 49:43.545
and can immediately toot horns

49:43.547 --> 49:44.913
like a jazz expert?

49:46.150 --> 49:48.116
Yes, this is a lucky baby.

49:48.118 --> 49:51.253
Or what if a man
who cannot speak with words

49:51.255 --> 49:55.624
but only with loud screams
of agonizing terror?

49:55.626 --> 49:58.460
No, he's actually not lucky.

49:58.462 --> 50:00.495
But now, let us see

50:00.497 --> 50:03.599
who is the most lucky person
in all the world.

50:03.601 --> 50:05.067
My finger shall tell you.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.347
It is me.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.016
Because I have the best friend
in all of the world.

50:22.386 --> 50:24.086
David.

50:24.088 --> 50:26.054
- Aw.
- Some years ago,

50:26.056 --> 50:28.123
my life as a deejay
was, as you say,

50:28.125 --> 50:30.559
a complete and 'butter' failure.

50:30.561 --> 50:33.128
Everyone in my town
was hating at my sound,

50:33.130 --> 50:35.931
but then one night
everything changed.

50:35.933 --> 50:39.234
When an American man
made a stop in the bar.

50:39.236 --> 50:42.104
He was on a 'soul search'
trip he did say.

50:42.106 --> 50:43.472
We talked for many hours

50:43.474 --> 50:45.607
and had many, many schnappses

50:45.609 --> 50:48.043
speaking of our
frustrations in life.

50:48.045 --> 50:51.013
We did hug and dance and, yes,

50:51.015 --> 50:54.116
cry some long and hard tears
like two pirates

50:54.118 --> 50:56.585
searching for booty
for many years

50:56.587 --> 50:59.354
but finding only dirt
and some coconuts.

51:02.426 --> 51:05.193
In the morning before David
did leave, he told me,

51:05.195 --> 51:09.264
'Flula, anytime you are
in Los Angeles, look me up.'

51:09.266 --> 51:11.600
And so the next day,
I purchased a ticket

51:11.602 --> 51:14.603
- and flew to Los Angeles.Ó
- Yep.

51:14.605 --> 51:17.506
"David was not yet home
from his soul search trip,

51:17.508 --> 51:20.709
So I did sleep on his porch
for 16 days.

51:20.711 --> 51:23.378
When he arrived home,
he called the police

51:23.380 --> 51:25.180
And did pretend
not to remember me."

51:25.182 --> 51:27.149
Which was very funny,
I must say, David.

51:27.151 --> 51:29.952
Really, it's this acting.
Whoa, you are nail it, right?

51:29.954 --> 51:32.988
Man, great work.
Talent.

51:32.990 --> 51:34.389
Anyway.

51:34.391 --> 51:37.059
"After the police left,
our friendship sprouted

51:37.061 --> 51:38.694
like a fresh field of asparagus.

51:38.696 --> 51:40.629
Except unlike asparagus,

51:40.631 --> 51:44.132
our friendship did not make
our urine smell terrible."

51:47.104 --> 51:49.137
And here's... oh, and some
nice things about Fankie.

51:49.139 --> 51:52.274
Some more... no, it's not applicable.
Ah, Ja.

51:52.276 --> 51:54.676
"David, we have been friends
from when we were both

51:54.678 --> 51:56.411
at the bottoms of life.

51:56.413 --> 51:59.214
And this is when
friendships are made strong,

51:59.216 --> 52:00.549
like two chandeliers

52:00.551 --> 52:03.085
that have fallen
inside a volcano.

52:03.087 --> 52:06.154
The chandeliers melt,
but then they stick together.

52:06.156 --> 52:08.156
And then when they cool down,

52:08.158 --> 52:10.492
they are hugging forever.

52:10.494 --> 52:14.229
Nothing can break this new
double chandelier apart.

52:14.231 --> 52:17.265
Except if it falls back
into the volcano.

52:17.267 --> 52:20.369
Or slips into a geyser."

52:20.371 --> 52:22.404
I mean, or if you drop it
from a large height,

52:22.406 --> 52:23.739
then it...
I will shatter.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.273
But then...

52:25.275 --> 52:27.175
"David, I love you very much.

52:27.177 --> 52:31.747
Here is to you, my best friend
forever and my honeybuddy.

52:31.749 --> 52:34.316
So, now let's have a toast
For David and Frankie"...

52:34.318 --> 52:37.452
Nope, just David,
we are just toasting for David.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.289
Cheers, guys, thank you.

52:42.793 --> 52:44.326
That was so sweet.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.728
- Oh, thanks.
- That really was.

52:46.730 --> 52:50.032
And, um, I'm just sorry you didn't
get to say it at my actual wedding.

52:50.034 --> 52:52.667
- Next time.
- You're really good at that.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.202
You should be a public speaker.

52:54.204 --> 52:55.337
- Oh, no.
- Professionally.

52:55.339 --> 52:56.671
- No, stop it.
- Yeah.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.607
David is the real
master thespian here.

52:58.609 --> 53:00.776
- Oh...
- Wait.

53:00.778 --> 53:02.210
I knew you looked familiar.

53:02.212 --> 53:04.146
Uh-uh.

53:04.148 --> 53:06.815
- You're a TV star, aren't you?
- Well, not a TV "star.

53:06.817 --> 53:08.450
I've... I've done
some stuff on TV.

53:08.452 --> 53:09.818
- No big deal.
- No, you're, like, famous.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.054
You were on that show
"Portland steel," right?

53:12.056 --> 53:14.222
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I was on "Portland steel."

53:14.224 --> 53:16.591
I did that, uh, pilot episode.

53:16.593 --> 53:19.461
I was... the character
didn't make it, but...

53:19.463 --> 53:21.163
- You saw that?
- Oh, my god.

53:21.165 --> 53:23.331
I was so pissed
when they fired you.

53:23.333 --> 53:24.666
- Wow.
- I loved you.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.435
- You were great.
- Thank you.

53:26.437 --> 53:27.803
Yeah.

53:27.805 --> 53:29.805
So, what else have you
been up to lately?

53:29.807 --> 53:31.506
I mean, any...
Anything I would've seen?

53:31.508 --> 53:33.542
Uh, well,

53:33.544 --> 53:36.244
okay, just some, um,
little kind of Indy things.

53:36.246 --> 53:38.113
- Yeah.
- Did a couple Indy dramas.

53:38.115 --> 53:40.415
- That's so cool.
- Some got a lot of buzz on the circuit.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.651
Do not be so modest.
He's done so many things.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.820
- Uh, stop it. -"Zombies vs.
Monkeys, part three."

53:44.822 --> 53:46.555
- No one saw that movie.
- I'm not really into sci-fi, so.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.190
- That was just for a paycheck.
- I'm just...

53:48.192 --> 53:49.524
I swear there's
something else, though.

53:49.526 --> 53:52.194
- What?
- No, there's... I can't

53:52.196 --> 53:53.628
- put my finger on it.
- That's pretty much it.

53:53.630 --> 53:55.464
- That is everything.
- I know there's... no.

53:55.466 --> 53:56.731
Well, there's "Little genius."
There's "Little genius."

53:56.733 --> 53:58.100
- Oh, my god!
- Why would you say that?

53:58.102 --> 53:59.768
It's "Little genius."

53:59.770 --> 54:01.436
Oh, my god.

54:01.438 --> 54:03.305
You are like
a national treasure.

54:03.307 --> 54:04.806
That is the...
Like, my favorite show

54:04.808 --> 54:06.208
- When I was little.
- Yeah?

54:06.210 --> 54:07.843
You were so cute.

54:07.845 --> 54:12.347
You used to be like,
"But I'm the real boy." right?

54:12.349 --> 54:14.516
It had that song, too...
How did the song go?

54:14.518 --> 54:16.118
- Like, little...
- I know that song.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.452
- You do?
- Yeah.

54:17.454 --> 54:19.387
- Yes, you have to play it.
- No... hey, no.

54:19.389 --> 54:21.123
- We you don't need to do that.
- Oh, my god, this is perfect.

54:21.125 --> 54:22.424
Please, can we not do that?

54:30.734 --> 54:32.300
It's so good.

54:39.743 --> 54:41.209
Here's comes the...

55:12.442 --> 55:14.309
All right, big finish.

55:36.967 --> 55:39.267
- What, he doesn't like it?
- It's a really good song.

55:39.269 --> 55:40.769
- It's so good, yeah.
- It's actually a Really good song.

55:40.771 --> 55:43.872
May be bathroom break.
I don't know.

55:45.475 --> 55:47.576
He doesn't shut up.

56:15.505 --> 56:16.705
Ugh!

56:47.537 --> 56:49.971
"Dearest Flula, thank you,

56:49.973 --> 56:53.675
Or, should I say,
danke for last night.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.443
Wow, wow.

56:55.445 --> 56:58.813
You are a master at making love.

56:58.815 --> 57:02.684
You are probably better at
making love Than making music.

57:02.686 --> 57:04.719
I would've thought
that was impossible,

57:04.721 --> 57:07.622
Since your music
is the best in the world,

57:07.624 --> 57:10.692
But, it is possible.

57:10.694 --> 57:12.927
I'll never forget you.

57:12.929 --> 57:16.798
Also, I'm glad I chose you
instead of David.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.066
Sincerely yours,

57:18.068 --> 57:19.968
Polly."

57:19.970 --> 57:21.569
"Ps: David"...

57:21.571 --> 57:23.038
..."This is really Flula.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.040
I did not have any
intimate relations with Polly.

57:25.042 --> 57:27.509
That would be inappropriate.

57:27.511 --> 57:29.911
Also, you just
got punked!"

57:42.626 --> 57:44.392
Oh, did I ruin your sounds?

57:44.394 --> 57:46.061
You saw my love note.

57:46.063 --> 57:48.430
Yeah, it was real funny.

57:48.432 --> 57:50.098
What?

57:50.100 --> 57:52.934
She was mine last night
and that's what I needed.

57:52.936 --> 57:54.936
And you came in
and you cockblocked me so hard.

57:54.938 --> 57:57.372
I told you
I didn't need a wingman, okay?

57:57.374 --> 57:59.040
You don't know when to shut up.

57:59.042 --> 58:00.608
Talking about "Little genius"?

58:00.610 --> 58:02.544
She liked you because
of "Little genius."

58:02.546 --> 58:04.713
I brought this up,
immediately, she likes you.

58:04.715 --> 58:07.982
- They were singing the song...
- Enough with "Little genius."

58:07.984 --> 58:09.951
- You're telling me Enough
of "Little genius"? - Yeah.

58:09.953 --> 58:11.953
That's all you
think about, David.

58:11.955 --> 58:14.089
I'm trying to bring you here
to nature, but where are you?

58:14.091 --> 58:15.924
You are stuck inside
your cranium there.

58:15.926 --> 58:18.626
I'm here to help you feel
better here on this trip.

58:18.628 --> 58:21.730
And all you do is you're a little
bitchier and you're a little moaner.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.499
Well, I've had enough moaners
and enough bitchers, David.

58:24.501 --> 58:25.967
- Suck it up.
- Sorry I'm depressed

58:25.969 --> 58:28.670
after my fiancee left me.

58:28.672 --> 58:30.705
But you know what you do
all day long?

58:30.707 --> 58:32.140
Dude, you have no filter.

58:35.078 --> 58:37.979
Did you see the note
that Frankie left me yesterday?

58:37.981 --> 58:40.715
Is that what this joke
is all about, man?

58:40.717 --> 58:42.484
What note?
David, no.

58:42.486 --> 58:45.587
You can't just laugh and dance
through real life shit.

58:45.589 --> 58:48.423
There are repercussions.
And you know another thing?

58:48.425 --> 58:49.624
- What?
- Remember that night

58:49.626 --> 58:51.393
In Germany when we met

58:51.395 --> 58:53.661
and had that great time
got all drunk off of schnapps?

58:53.663 --> 58:55.830
- Yeah.
- I don't.

58:55.832 --> 58:57.899
I don't remember meeting you.

58:57.901 --> 59:00.735
That is the genesis
of this relationship, okay?

59:00.737 --> 59:03.071
And I don't remember
inviting you to America.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.550
You know what?

59:15.552 --> 59:18.420
I'm going to go to the
next campsite without you.

59:18.422 --> 59:20.722
Clearly you need to be alone.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.494
Okay, yeah, I hope you
get there without a map.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.255
"Fatigue is high.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:38.059
Bad spirits abound.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.661
This is without a doubt

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:41.696
the lowest point
of our journey."

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.354
- What is this?
- Oh, my god.

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:08.122
I can't believe
I forget to cancel them.

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.259
They look like vikings.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.628
But friendly.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.812
Well, hi.
You must be David.

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.715
- Yes.
- And you must be Frankie.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.717
- Uh...
- We're very pleased

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:37.885
to be able to play for you
for this special occasion.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.189
This is the Organ
Renaissance Band,

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.991
and we have just played

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:45.994
a piece by Anthony Holborne
called, "The nightwatch."

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.963
And we have a few more numbers
to play for you this evening,

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:52.367
and we hope that you enjoy what
we've put together for you.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:55.169
Two, three, four...

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.827
What?
The vikings are here?

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:28.496
Hey, man,
I know I've been a, uh,

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.331
- Real dick.
- Yeah.

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.833
And I want to apologize to you.

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:33.468
Uh, it's okay.
I forgive you, David.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.436
Don't give it to me that easy.

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.505
- I...
- It's fine, David, we're friends again.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.207
Shh.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.775
I want to make it up to you,

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.178
and here's how.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.114
Yeah?
Remember these?

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:47.281
Now, I've never
done these before,

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.751
but I... okay.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.419
I... I think you have to be
in the right headspace...

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:55.156
My god, stop. That's way too much.
Give that to me.

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:57.425
Wow.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.026
Go, David.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.098
Mm.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.934
This do this.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:09.203
- Let's do this.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.176
Do you think
the wolf is gonna eat us?

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:31.679
I don't think we should
Close our eyes, David.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:39.320
I think I know why
Frankie left me.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:48.195
If we make it out of here alive,

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.364
I'm gonna change my priorities.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.066
I'm gonna change my whole life.

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:02.143
I dropped your phone on purpose.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:49.756
Oh. Good morning, David.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.258
Good news.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.160
We did not get eaten last night.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.531
Suck it, wolf!

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.533
Let's go find that lodge.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.438
Aw, man, I'm so hungry.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:07.774
Hungry like a...
A wolf, actually.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.147
"Great joy in the party.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:17.151
We have reached
the end of the continent.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.286
To my dear friend Meriwether,

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:22.656
No man exists with whom I would
have preferred to endure

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.759
such a journey.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.761
Now let us enjoy
this celebrated day."

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.332
Wow, David.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.335
It looks like a robots helmet.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.703
Yeah, it's quite modern,
isn't it?

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.372
David, are you ready
for all the snacks?

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:39.740
I'm ready for 'em.
Give 'em to me.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.142
Do you think they have
spaghetti bolognese.

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:42.276
Oh, they got everything.

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:43.444
- Steak?
- Yes.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.279
- Fries that are french?
- Yes.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.814
- Croissants?
- Oh, I know they got croissants.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:48.682
- Cabbage?
- No, I don't want those.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.417
Well, I'll eat your cabbage.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.319
Gentlemen, welcome to big piney.

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.723
- Thank you.
- Saw you coming up the walk.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.659
- Is one of you David?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:02.063
Your agent's been calling
quite a bit, and, uh,

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.397
he wanted you to have this note.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.200
Something about Lewis and Clark.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.536
Wow, awesome, uh,
a quick question.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.271
Sir, would it be possible
to bring a cot

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.807
- Into our room?
- Yeah, no problem.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:15.242
- We'll have one brought up right away.
- You hear that, Flula?

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.578
Nobody's cutting
any beds in half tonight.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.113
Okay, go on in.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:21.482
Breakfast is ready,
hot coffee is ready.

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:23.517
- All set for you guys.
- Sounds wonderful.

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.853
Have a great stay.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.456
Ah, stop and look at me, David.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.225
- Is there a problem?
- I just remembered.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:34.462
- I'm allergic to cots.
- You're not coming?

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:37.631
I think we should
keep on hiking, David.

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.434
Come on, this direction
looks like a fun place.

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:43.737
We're just now learning
how to survive wolf attacks.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.739
I just want a hot shower.
You get it.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.441
No, no, you don't...

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:50.778
This place looks dirty,
has very low reviews on "Yelp."

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.513
Let's go here
and hike and hike and hike.

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:54.482
I gotta get some food.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:03.257
Hi, Frankie.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.892
Oh, look at that fog.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.394
It... it badly
needs to be recorded.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.562
Right away.

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.738
I texted you,
but I never heard back.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.406
I was trying to tell you
I'd be here.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.609
That's what you were
trying to tell me?

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.511
Yeah.

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:24.745
Why?

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:26.580
Nothing.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:29.416
Just I...

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:32.153
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:34.855
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.658
I wasn't ready to get married.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.760
I... I just...

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.930
I wish I had done it
a lot earlier.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.834
I could've saved both of us
a lot of heartache.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:51.472
But I'm glad
you went on the honeymoon.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.607
You look different.

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.309
You look like shit, actually,

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.279
But you look happy.

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:04.385
So, how was hiking With Flula?

01:12:04.387 --> 01:12:06.921
It was interesting.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:09.456
He is a, uh...

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.760
Human puzzle.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.695
What is he doing?

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.730
He's a recording a song.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:21.335
And it's either going to be the
greatest German work since Wagner,

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.805
Or it's going to set
all of humanity back 100 years.

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.477
It's been quite a honeymoon.

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.380
How did...
Did you hike here?

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.549
- No, I drove.
- All the way?

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:37.785
- Yeah, took 20 minutes.
- Wow. Yeah.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.386
We shoulda drove.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.590
What's in the note?

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:45.926
Oh, um, this was from my agent.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:48.896
It's about
the "Lewis and Clark" movie.

01:12:48.898 --> 01:12:50.998
Remember that?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.600
I'm not gonna open it, though.

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.705
You know, I think I'm gonna
start focusing more

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.707
on what's in front of me.

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:11.986
Good luck, David and Frankie.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:08.509
Hey, Flula.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.614
Hey, I just noticed
you were taking off,

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.316
And I just wanted to say
this was fun.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:16.917
Yeah, I figured you want to,

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.786
you know, figure things
out with Frankie, so.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.756
Yeah, I'm gonna
stick back with Frankie.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.925
But, hey, man,
it was a great trip.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.760
It's not finished.
I'm... I'm gonna finish it.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:27.961
So...

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.065
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.438
See you.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:40.342
Dude.

01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:44.511
You really think I'm not gonna
finish this trip with you?

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:46.947
- What are you, crazy?
- David.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.582
I'm a little insulted.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.018
Look, the Frankie stuff
will figure itself later.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.954
- You got me.
- Well, I'm pretty good.

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.522
Now it's my turn.
You know this, right?

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:57.825
Well, trip's over.
We're even.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.460
- That's it.
- Okay, David, no problem.

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:01.428
- Fingers crossed.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.564
You know, you're not
actually supposed to say

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.432
"fingers crossed" when you lie.

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:07.901
Understood, David.
Fingers crossed.

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.970
Hey, did you get enough
sounds for your song?

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.538
Oh, yes, David, it's going to be

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.574
The greatest song of all times.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:17.878
It's called "Honeybuddies
forever, Superman never"

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.646
you know,
because of Superman's blatant

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.515
human rights violations,
of course.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.651
Do you actually think
that Lois Lane and Superman

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.120
Were the ones
who explored this area?

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.855
What... does he...
What I don't get

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:31.125
Is why Superman and Lois
Had to take canoes at all.

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.960
- You know?
- Uh...

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:35.763
Couldn't Superman just carry
Lois in his arms

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.998
and fly around
these beautiful mountains,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.533
And then tell
President Traveston

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.568
and Lex Luthor about it
when he got back?

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.404
Seems logical to me.

01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:45.739
You are raising questions
that I promise you

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.508
Historians have never asked.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:48.909
Thank you.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:50.878
One last question
for you, David.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880
Do you... Do you see that white
furry, dog-like creature

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.415
- Running towards us?

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:56.083
It's 30 meters.
No, it's 20 meters.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.785
It's like ten meters away...
Wait... ah!

01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:59.019
Uh...

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:01.789
Honeybuddy, yeah!

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:09.596
Yeah! Boom!

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.021
- Honeybuddies.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.722
Do that again.

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:37.591
- No, back, back.
- What?

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.760
Back... shh!... Do that again.
No.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.061
- What?
- Back, back.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.930
- What?
- Back... shh!... Do that again.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:44.798
- No, back, back.
- What? What?

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.767
- Back... shh! Do that again.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.470
No... back, back.
Just go faster.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.911
Just go faster.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.146
Yeah!

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.585
- What is happening?
- Shh!

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.768
"We are now about to penetrate

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.270
a country

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:27.541
on which the foot of civilized
man has never trod.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:31.545
It was on the spot where I
saw a beautiful white wolf

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:34.181
The largest we had ever seen.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:38.785
But this beauty surely allies
some unknown danger.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:41.121
I am no coward,
but I fear that all will not

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.856
Make it across
this continent."

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.659
Just go, just go, just go,
just go, just go, just go,

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.262
Just go, just go, just go,
just go, just go, just go,

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:51.131
- Just go...
- Danger. Danger.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.133
- Danger. Danger.

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:56.637
Danger. Danger.
Danger. Danger.

01:17:56.639 --> 01:17:58.171
- Danger. Danger. Danger.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:00.040
Danger. Danger. Danger.
Danger. Danger...

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.847
Honeybuddies, yeah!

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:39.112
- Honeybuddies.
