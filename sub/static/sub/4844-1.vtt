Send along another load

01:59.260 --> 02:03.970
And win that war, win that war

02:05.700 --> 02:07.656
One more to go and then one more

02:20.380 --> 02:22.655
Send them along, send them along?

02:22.740 --> 02:24.458
Hey, you!

02:24.700 --> 02:26.292
- Me?
- Your ID.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.018
My which?

02:32.260 --> 02:34.216
Oh, I ain't here to work.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.212
- NoWhat for, then?
- I'm looking for a corporal named...

02:37.300 --> 02:40.576
You can't go in to see a <i>general</i>
without proper identification.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.652
- You've gotta have a pass.
- Well, where do I get one?

02:43.740 --> 02:45.856
From the security officer.

02:45.940 --> 02:49.296
- Where's he?
- Securing himself, in Washington.

02:49.380 --> 02:52.053
Your corporal will be a brigadier
time he gets back here.

02:55.180 --> 02:57.136
Lift 'em up and put 'em down

02:57.220 --> 02:59.051
Lift 'em up and put 'em down

02:59.140 --> 03:01.290
Mark time
and lift your tootsies

03:01.380 --> 03:03.336
Six inches off the ground

03:03.420 --> 03:05.217
Lift 'em up and put 'em down

03:05.300 --> 03:07.336
Marching all around the town

03:07.420 --> 03:09.570
Company, squads right

03:09.660 --> 03:11.696
That means turn around!

03:11.780 --> 03:13.657
Wish that I was 21

03:13.740 --> 03:15.651
- Squad, hup!
- Old enough to tote a gun

03:15.740 --> 03:18.049
I'd go and be a soldier

03:18.140 --> 03:20.176
They're the ones that have the fun

03:20.260 --> 03:22.455
Wish I was a bugle man

03:22.540 --> 03:24.451
Playing in the army band

03:24.540 --> 03:27.930
I'd blow until I bust it
Playing in the army band?

03:28.020 --> 03:29.339
Glad you could find the time
to join us.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.456
Hope we didn't inconvenience you,
Corporal.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.939
Joe! Joe!

03:34.380 --> 03:36.769
Wipe that smile off your face.
Fall in!

03:39.020 --> 03:41.409
All guard, present arms!

03:41.500 --> 03:42.979
Present arms!

03:43.060 --> 03:47.178
All guard, order arms!

03:47.380 --> 03:49.735
All guard, file!

03:52.100 --> 03:53.089
At ease!

03:53.180 --> 03:56.172
- Cindy Lou!
- Surprised to see me?

03:56.260 --> 03:57.818
You can say that again.

03:58.300 --> 04:01.212
Oh, Joe, I know
I ain't smart like you,

04:01.300 --> 04:05.134
but if the way I feel makes up
for it, then I's way ahead.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.610
- How you been, honey?
- Missin' you. My ma said...

04:08.700 --> 04:10.338
- She all right?
- Uh-huh.

04:10.420 --> 04:14.413
When I got your letter, she say
"Cindy Lou, you go see Joe off."

04:14.500 --> 04:15.979
Woulda come anyway.

04:16.060 --> 04:20.451
Hey, hey! Going to flying school's
nothin' to cry about.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.008
Either got to cry...
or bust!

04:23.100 --> 04:24.738
I'm so proud of you.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.538
Come onto this side of the fence
and tell me that.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.656
- Can't.
- Why not?

04:28.740 --> 04:31.777
- Got no pass.
- Just you watch.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.010
Joe, don't get into trouble
on account of me!

04:34.100 --> 04:36.091
I never saw trouble look better.

04:36.180 --> 04:38.535
Hey, Corporal! Pass that civilian.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.249
- You're the Joe she's looking for?
- Nobody else.

04:42.340 --> 04:45.093
- Why didn't you say you're his gal?
- All the way.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.216
Then you're responsible.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.018
All the way.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.739
Hey, Dave!
Put away my gear for me, will ya?

04:55.820 --> 04:57.492
Thanks.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.459
Congratulations, Corporal.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.169
That Air Corps was smart in picking
you for officers' flying school.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.409
Thanks!

05:12.500 --> 05:14.491
- Hi, Carmen.
- Hi.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.969
Well, get a load of
<i>this</i> hip-swinging floozy

05:17.060 --> 05:19.369
rolling around to work
in time for lunch.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.179
Hey, puss.
You make sounds I don't like.

05:22.260 --> 05:24.455
I'm telling the foreman
you was late again.

05:24.540 --> 05:27.338
You do that and I'll scratch out
the one good eye you got left.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.775
Hey, Carmen. How about going to
Pastor's with me tonight?

05:29.860 --> 05:32.135
I can dance those other guys
right off the floor.

05:32.220 --> 05:34.176
T- Bone, you too little and too late.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.820
I don't waste no time. Dig me, baby?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.891
Wastin' your time right now,
Sergeant.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.050
The wind's blowing
in another direction.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.892
Ain't no use arguin'
with the wind.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.653
Hey, how about going out with me
tonight instead of playing the field?

05:45.740 --> 05:49.050
Yeah, Carmen. Pick out one.
That'll release the rest of 'em.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.176
I won't pick out a man

05:52.020 --> 05:54.136
And he won't pick out me

05:54.820 --> 05:57.288
It don't go dat way

05:58.020 --> 06:01.296
You can't ever know

06:04.500 --> 06:08.334
Where your crazy heart

06:09.660 --> 06:12.538
Wants to go

06:17.060 --> 06:20.336
Love's a baby dat grows up wild

06:20.420 --> 06:23.298
And he don't do
what you want him to

06:23.380 --> 06:26.497
Love ain't nobody's ángel child

06:26.580 --> 06:29.890
And he won't pay any mind to you

06:29.980 --> 06:33.017
One man gives me his diamond stud

06:33.100 --> 06:36.012
And I won't give him a cigarette

06:36.100 --> 06:39.854
One man treats me like I was mud

06:41.100 --> 06:45.412
And all I got, dat man can get

06:45.500 --> 06:46.694
Love's a baby
that grows up wild...

06:46.780 --> 06:47.974
Dat's love

06:48.060 --> 06:51.370
- He don't do what you want him to
- Dat's love

06:51.460 --> 06:54.816
- Love ain't nobody's ángel child
- Dat's love

06:54.900 --> 06:57.016
- And he won't pay any mind to you
- Dat's love

06:57.100 --> 07:00.137
You go for me and I'm taboo

07:00.220 --> 07:03.417
But if you're hard to get,
I go for you

07:03.500 --> 07:08.130
And if I do,
then you are through, boy

07:08.220 --> 07:11.337
My baby, dat's the end of you

07:11.420 --> 07:12.899
The end of you!

07:12.980 --> 07:15.938
So take your cue, boy

07:16.020 --> 07:20.332
Don't say I didn't tell you true

07:20.420 --> 07:21.819
You know you're through

07:21.900 --> 07:23.936
I told you truly

07:24.020 --> 07:26.739
If I love you

07:26.820 --> 07:29.778
Dat's the end of you

07:29.860 --> 07:32.977
You go for me
and I'm taboo

07:33.060 --> 07:35.699
But if you're hard to get,
I go for you

07:35.780 --> 07:39.170
And if I do,
then you are through, boy

07:39.260 --> 07:41.490
My baby, that's the end of you

07:41.580 --> 07:43.093
The end of you!

07:43.180 --> 07:46.297
So take your cue, boy

07:46.780 --> 07:51.615
Don't say I didn't tell you true

07:51.700 --> 07:53.133
She told you true!

07:53.220 --> 07:55.097
I told you truly

07:55.180 --> 08:01.096
If I love you,
dat's the end of you?

08:01.180 --> 08:03.250
Gimme a chicken sandwich.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.217
When your lover decides to fly

08:09.300 --> 08:12.292
Dere ain't no door
dat you can close

08:12.380 --> 08:15.452
She just pecks ya
a quick goodbye

08:15.540 --> 08:19.055
And flicks the salt from her tail
and goes

08:19.140 --> 08:21.893
If you listen,
then you'll get taught

08:21.980 --> 08:25.177
And here's your lesson for today

08:25.260 --> 08:28.889
If I chase ya,
then you'll get caught

08:29.380 --> 08:33.931
And once I got you, I go my way

08:34.020 --> 08:36.932
- When your lover decides to fly
- Dat's love

08:37.020 --> 08:39.659
- Dere ain't no door you can close
- Dat's love

08:39.740 --> 08:42.538
- She pecks you a quick goodbye
- Dat's love

08:42.620 --> 08:43.972
Flicks the salt from her tail
and goes

08:44.059 --> 08:45.413
Dat's love

08:45.500 --> 08:48.219
You go for me and I'm taboo

08:48.300 --> 08:51.417
But if you're hard to get,
I go for you

08:51.500 --> 08:55.015
And if I do, then you are through

08:55.100 --> 08:56.328
Boy!

08:56.420 --> 08:59.218
My baby, that's the end of you

08:59.300 --> 09:00.733
The end of you!

09:00.820 --> 09:03.732
So take your cue, boy

09:03.820 --> 09:08.211
Don't say I didn't tell you true

09:08.300 --> 09:09.858
She told you true!

09:10.060 --> 09:11.891
I told you truly

09:11.980 --> 09:14.130
If I love you

09:14.220 --> 09:17.371
Dat's the end of you!?

09:25.100 --> 09:27.568
I hear you're gonna be a fly boy.
Congratulations.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.218
Thanks.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.299
I hope if you're gonna use
a parachute, it's one I made.

09:40.140 --> 09:43.018
I'd like to toss a party for you
tonight at Billy Pastor's.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.170
Give you a real send-off.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.933
Pick me up at eight.
We'll have ourselves a ball.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.897
Sorry. I've got a date.

09:51.740 --> 09:55.528
Honeybee, if you change your mind,
you know where to buzz me.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.569
That girl's mighty pretty.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.298
Oh, I don't know.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.053
She's what the fellas back home
call a hot bundle, I guess.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.131
Yeah.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.292
Looks like she's on fire
just for you.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.371
I never lit it, honey.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.052
How do I know?

10:20.140 --> 10:21.892
Cos I got a girl.

10:23.180 --> 10:26.616
But I live in another town
and I know what the fellas say.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.579
"If you got a gal in another town,
well, you ain't got no gal at all."

10:30.660 --> 10:33.220
Yeah, but you're not just any girl,
Cindy Lou.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.770
There's nobody in the whole worid
like you. Nobody.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.377
- Except...
- Except who?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.658
The maw.

10:42.820 --> 10:46.449
You talk just like my maw

10:46.540 --> 10:50.818
You even walk just like my maw

10:50.900 --> 10:55.212
And I know why I'm stuck on you

10:55.300 --> 11:00.090
It's cos I'm just like my paw

11:00.940 --> 11:04.410
I talk just like your maw

11:04.500 --> 11:06.730
I even walk

11:06.820 --> 11:08.936
Just like your maw

11:09.020 --> 11:13.536
And I can see why you like me

11:13.620 --> 11:17.374
Cos you is like your paw

11:17.460 --> 11:21.373
- You's awful like your paw
- Oh

11:21.460 --> 11:26.659
Let me tell you
what the Lord did

11:26.740 --> 11:29.573
He made me live next door

11:29.660 --> 11:32.538
So we could fall in love

11:32.620 --> 11:40.334
The way my paw and maw did

11:40.420 --> 11:44.095
Is you my Cindy Lou?

11:44.180 --> 11:47.172
I is your Cindy Lou

11:47.260 --> 11:50.855
And I belong to you

11:50.940 --> 11:55.411
And I belong to you

11:55.500 --> 11:59.015
I is your Joe

11:59.100 --> 12:02.570
My Cindy Lou

12:02.660 --> 12:10.419
And I belong

12:11.580 --> 12:15.892
To...

12:15.980 --> 12:23.056
You?

12:27.620 --> 12:31.499
- Cindy, suppose I asked my CO...
- Asked him what, Joe?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.172
To write OK in triplicate.

12:33.260 --> 12:34.773
And what if I found a chaplain

12:34.860 --> 12:37.772
and I said "Sir, here are orders
for a rushed wedding"?

12:37.860 --> 12:38.895
Joe...

12:38.980 --> 12:41.175
No use waiting till the war's over
for us to get married,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.091
not when I got a 24-hour pass.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.579
Our honeymoon could be tonight.

12:44.660 --> 12:48.858
What'll our folks say,
us not getting married in church?

12:48.940 --> 12:50.692
What do <i>you</i> say?

12:53.660 --> 12:56.220
You wait right here
while I go find the CO.

13:11.260 --> 13:14.696
You blabbermouth witch! I told you
if you told the foreman on me, I'd...

13:14.780 --> 13:17.340
Go back to that bad street
you come off of!

13:49.220 --> 13:51.097
Take that off. What's this?

13:51.180 --> 13:52.898
A full net of catfish!

13:53.420 --> 13:56.492
Bail her out of that 'chute!
Who's responsible for this?

13:56.580 --> 13:57.808
Me!

13:57.900 --> 14:00.698
Corporal,
take custody of that prisoner.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.934
- Prisoner?
- Interfering with the war effort.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.897
Destroying Government property.

14:06.620 --> 14:10.056
You heard me.
Remove the prisoner off that table.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.894
You go for me and I'm taboo

14:13.980 --> 14:17.973
But if you're hard to get,
I go for you...?

14:18.900 --> 14:21.334
Give this to the judge in Masonville.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.978
Masonville?

14:23.060 --> 14:25.415
You know the Army
can't put civilians in jail.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.570
Gotta leave that pleasure
to the other civilians.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.537
But I'm off-duty.
I got a 24-hour pass.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.657
You mean you had yourself a pass.
This is an emergency.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.935
- Sabotage, maybe.
- But Sarge, I don't see why...

14:35.020 --> 14:37.580
You don't go to flying school
till the morning

14:37.660 --> 14:40.538
which leaves all night
to take care of the prisoner.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.770
Here's the formal charges.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.570
Judge sure to get it now.

14:46.660 --> 14:50.130
Corporal, do your duty.
Take me to town.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.529
Request a five-minute pass,
respectfully.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.497
What for?

14:54.580 --> 14:57.890
- Private reasons.
- Request not granted, respectfully.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.336
In case you forgot the manual,
you're responsible for this prisoner

15:01.420 --> 15:04.139
until you dump her in the lap
of the civilian authorities.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.176
Now get going.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.057
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:11.140 --> 15:13.210
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:13.300 --> 15:15.177
Carmen's gotta stay in jail

15:15.260 --> 15:17.296
Sit all day upon her tail

15:17.380 --> 15:19.098
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:19.180 --> 15:20.533
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:20.620 --> 15:23.088
Carmen's gotta stay in jail

15:23.180 --> 15:25.216
Sit all day upon her tail

15:25.300 --> 15:27.052
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:27.140 --> 15:29.017
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:29.100 --> 15:31.011
Carmen's gotta stay in jail

15:31.100 --> 15:32.977
Sit all day upon her tail

15:33.060 --> 15:34.652
Carmen Jones is goin' to jail

15:34.740 --> 15:37.732
Is going to jail,
is going to jail, hooray!?

15:37.820 --> 15:39.731
Somethin' wrong, little gal?

15:39.820 --> 15:42.334
He volunteered
to take Miss Jones to jail.

15:42.420 --> 15:45.696
Long way to town.
What you figure he got in mind?

15:45.780 --> 15:48.738
Just shows,
you can't trust no corporals.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.731
Well, I trust Joe.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.212
What's your rush?

16:03.300 --> 16:06.975
The sooner we get there,
the quicker we gotta bust apart.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.416
Cut that out.

16:12.220 --> 16:14.336
Get over where you belong.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.498
That's just what I'm doing.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.413
OK, honey, accelerate me
all you want!

16:26.100 --> 16:29.695
The harder I get bumped,
the more of me bounces.

16:33.020 --> 16:36.410
Sugar, you ain't gonna take me
to the cooler, are ya?

16:37.620 --> 16:40.930
I can't do you much good
once I'm in jail.

16:46.860 --> 16:50.569
What do you say we drive to a little
place I know on the edge of town?

16:51.060 --> 16:53.733
I'll show you more fun
than you ever had.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.697
You're going to jail.

16:56.660 --> 17:00.255
Dere's a cafe on the corner

17:00.340 --> 17:03.537
Run by my friend Billy Pastor

17:03.620 --> 17:09.330
A spot where a man takes a lady
when he wants to move faster

17:10.020 --> 17:13.137
Guess I'll go
and say hello to Pastor

17:18.819 --> 17:20.617
How can a lady drink alone?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.531
How can a lady dance alone?

17:22.619 --> 17:24.416
No lady can romance alone

17:24.500 --> 17:27.412
I ought to have a sweetie-pie

17:28.980 --> 17:30.732
The one I had

17:30.820 --> 17:33.015
I gave the air to

17:33.100 --> 17:35.056
I threw his toothbrush out the door

17:35.140 --> 17:38.769
Now that I'm free
My heart is sighin'

17:38.860 --> 17:42.455
I'm off the hook
and lookin' for more

17:42.540 --> 17:45.213
Dozens of fellas telephone me

17:45.500 --> 17:47.968
All asking me to make a date

17:48.460 --> 17:51.736
I'm holding out
for somethin' special

17:52.100 --> 17:54.056
But I don't know

17:54.140 --> 17:56.654
How long I'll wait

17:56.740 --> 17:58.651
Where will I wind up?

17:58.740 --> 18:00.492
Who'll I be true to?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.571
Ain't made my mind up

18:02.660 --> 18:04.252
Waitin' for you to

18:04.340 --> 18:06.296
What you say, brother?
What you say, boy?

18:06.380 --> 18:09.497
Ain't it time that we got away?

18:09.580 --> 18:13.095
Ten o'clock sharp on the corner

18:13.180 --> 18:16.252
See that you're
right in there pitchin'

18:16.340 --> 18:22.734
Cos I ain't the kind of a mare
that'll stand without hitchin'

18:22.820 --> 18:25.618
Now you got your little filly
at the starting gate

18:25.700 --> 18:29.329
Got a little filly
who is raring to go?

18:58.860 --> 19:00.816
No, you don't.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.575
- I just want to stretch my legs.
- Stretch them in here.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.333
Boy, you's the roughest of rough.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.934
Won't even give me a little break.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.295
Sorry, you're a prisoner.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.057
You mean to say
you're really gonna take me to jail?

19:16.300 --> 19:18.291
You won't be in for long.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.609
A minute's too long for me.
I can't stand being cooped up.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.054
- An order's an order.
- Not here it ain't.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.052
Aah!

21:15.700 --> 21:17.213
Uh-uh.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.689
That's no way to get to Masonville.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.738
I'd like to see the road
that can stop this baby.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.890
You will, sugar.

22:09.780 --> 22:13.090
Ain't no use.
You'll only get messed up.

22:18.660 --> 22:21.652
Careful, honey.
You'll bust your gaskets.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.132
OK, out!

22:46.180 --> 22:48.091
Oop!

22:56.020 --> 22:58.056
Boy, but you's strong.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.011
Way you pulled me up
like I was nothin'.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.978
Bet you're a good dancer,
ain't you, honey?

23:07.060 --> 23:09.335
Maybe we could have us a lot of fun.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.698
Now, if you ask my advice,

23:15.780 --> 23:19.489
you'd turn right around and go back
as far as the railroad crossing,

23:19.580 --> 23:21.616
then along the track...

23:21.700 --> 23:25.375
till you get to Senatobia,
which is my home town,

23:25.460 --> 23:27.974
where the train stops for Masonville.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.176
You're trying to trick me
and I know it.

23:30.260 --> 23:33.297
I wouldn't do that no more.
Cross my heart.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.889
OK, we'll do it your way.

23:53.100 --> 23:56.251
Now get going.
And don't try nothing funny.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.131
Believe me now?

24:12.220 --> 24:13.972
When we get to Masonville.

24:14.060 --> 24:17.609
Still don't trust me, huh?
Guess I'll have to work on it.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.173
Hi, Willa.

24:19.260 --> 24:22.297
Well, look who's home!
Carmen Jones!

24:23.260 --> 24:26.457
Say, ain't that a brigadier-admiral
you got on your arm?

24:26.540 --> 24:28.974
Somethin' better.
This boy's gonna be a pilot.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.334
Really?

24:30.420 --> 24:34.379
Let's see now. Fly boy's gotta have
something special for supper.

24:34.460 --> 24:36.451
Well, how about
a nice roast chicken, Carmen?

24:36.540 --> 24:38.258
Yeah. Like that.

24:39.180 --> 24:40.533
Hi, Harry!

24:40.620 --> 24:43.737
Hi, Carmen. We got potatoes,
beets, carrots, corn...

24:43.820 --> 24:47.051
- And peaches right off the tree!
- Oh, peaches!

24:47.140 --> 24:50.337
We can eat in Masonville.
Where's that train?

24:50.420 --> 24:54.618
It ain't due till the moon's up. This
town's the last stop for the moon.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.817
Come on, I wanna know
when that train comes in.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.538
Not till ten.

24:59.620 --> 25:03.533
I got time to cook you a supper
you won't <i>ever</i> forget.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.295
- Thanks, Harry.
- Thank you.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.450
Oh, wait.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.134
This is for you, fly boy... for free.

25:11.220 --> 25:14.132
- It's mighty kind of you, but...
- We'll accept.

25:31.820 --> 25:35.256
Hello, Grandma.
How you feelin', honey?

25:35.340 --> 25:38.889
- I brought a fella home for supper.
- Hi.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.936
Grandma, somethin' wrong?

25:41.020 --> 25:44.456
- Trouble comin' your way. Soon.
- What trouble?

25:44.540 --> 25:47.850
Found a buzzard feather
on the doorstep.

25:47.940 --> 25:51.455
- Buzzard feather?
- Just 'fore you come.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.060
She's trying to keep
the bad spirits off

26:02.140 --> 26:04.973
with that pail of water
in the moonlight.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.893
Let the ol' buzzard
flap his wings right over me.

26:10.980 --> 26:14.131
Till he comes down and gets me,
I got a lot of livin' to do.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.370
Don't tell me you go for that junk.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.975
Come on. Start the party rollin'.

26:23.740 --> 26:26.538
Have yourself a drink
while I get supper ready.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.576
Thanks, but I don't drink.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.048
Boy!

26:32.620 --> 26:36.613
If the Army was made up of
nothin' but soldiers like you,

26:36.700 --> 26:39.134
the war wouldn't do nobody no good.

26:42.980 --> 26:46.290
Guess that's what
I like about you, though, Joey.

26:48.180 --> 26:50.535
You ain't like the others.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.811
No.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.050
You ain't like them at all.

27:06.780 --> 27:10.455
Say, that little candy-faced gal
I seen you with at the canteen,

27:10.540 --> 27:12.531
she your steady?

27:15.820 --> 27:17.458
Uh-huh.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.930
How steady?

27:22.020 --> 27:24.011
We're getting married.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.936
Soon as I get back to the base.

27:28.820 --> 27:32.972
So that's why you were in a hurry
to dump me off in Masonville.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.937
I'm right in the way of
your honeymoon.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.136
But not for long.

27:39.420 --> 27:42.139
- Ain't no way to get the mud off.
- It's OK.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.256
Good thing you're getting married.

27:47.660 --> 27:50.128
You need a gal to look after you
in the worst way.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.972
I'll do it.

27:52.580 --> 27:55.014
You'll only mess yourself.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.615
Don't want to get into trouble
with them Army cops in Masonville.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.089
You'll never get to flying school.

28:03.820 --> 28:07.859
Bet when the war is over, you'll come
home with a chest full of medals,

28:07.940 --> 28:10.056
and that gal... What's her name?

28:10.140 --> 28:12.608
- Cindy Lou.
- Yeah.

28:12.700 --> 28:15.168
She'll hand 'em out to all your kids.

28:16.300 --> 28:19.133
Better win a lot of medals.
You and Cindy Lou'll need 'em.

28:19.220 --> 28:21.017
One every year.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.738
No bunch of kids for me,

28:22.820 --> 28:25.050
not till I can take care of 'em
real good.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.208
Got that all figured out too, huh?

28:28.700 --> 28:31.294
I'm not going back to the farm.

28:31.380 --> 28:34.895
I'm going to school,
learn all about planes.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.495
What you gonna do
when the war's over?

28:38.580 --> 28:41.174
The parachute factory's bound
to close. You comin' back here?

28:41.260 --> 28:43.251
Maybe. Maybe not.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.013
I never figure
from one day to the next.

28:46.860 --> 28:48.896
Guess you don't have to.

28:48.980 --> 28:51.096
You're sure to get a husband
in any town.

28:51.180 --> 28:52.932
MarriedMe?

28:53.020 --> 28:54.817
Never.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.170
Shoes need polish bad.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.331
- I do my own.
- Not when I'm around.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.810
Sure, you'll get married.

29:08.140 --> 29:11.132
I bet you'll have
all those kids you wished on me.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.859
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

29:13.940 --> 29:15.976
Ain't in the cards.

29:16.060 --> 29:19.018
Look, you can't let that spooky stuff
trip you up.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.011
Signs never lie, Joe.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.330
Just don't pay 'em no mind, Carmen.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.138
A gal like you:

29:25.220 --> 29:28.371
Why, there's nothing you couldn't get
if you aim for it.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.496
How do you figure that?

29:30.580 --> 29:32.650
Just look at you.

29:33.340 --> 29:35.854
You got a lot more than other gals.

29:37.780 --> 29:39.930
A lot more what?

29:43.260 --> 29:45.410
Got your belt on twisted.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.051
I'll fix it.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.172
What's the matter?

29:51.260 --> 29:53.376
Still don't trust me, huh?

30:02.220 --> 30:04.973
Or don't you trust yourself?

30:30.500 --> 30:32.377
Carmen!

30:33.500 --> 30:35.092
Carmen?

30:43.580 --> 30:45.218
<i>"Sorry, honey."</i>

30:45.300 --> 30:48.929
<i>"Like I told you, I couldn't stand</i>
<i>being cooped up in jail. "</i>

30:49.020 --> 30:52.729
<i>"I gotta be free to come and go</i>
<i>or I'd just die. "</i>

30:52.820 --> 30:55.937
<i>"Don't hate me, Joey, cos I love you,</i>

30:56.020 --> 30:58.454
<i>like I loved no man before. "</i>

31:09.020 --> 31:10.897
Prisoners, halt!

31:12.140 --> 31:14.017
Left face!

31:14.100 --> 31:16.170
OK, sit down.

31:29.820 --> 31:33.574
Joe, honey,
I thought I'd never see you again.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.259
I tried and I asked...

31:37.660 --> 31:40.777
They don't allow no visitors
the first two weeks in the stockade.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.053
I'm sorry. Carrying on like this.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.529
I made myself promise I wouldn't.

31:46.620 --> 31:48.611
That's all right, Cindy.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.656
How you been?

31:50.740 --> 31:53.208
Waitin'. Just waitin' to see you.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.857
Won't help none,
you hanging around.

31:57.940 --> 31:59.498
You oughta go home to your maw.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.975
- You want me to?
- I was just thinkin' of you, Cindy.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.176
Home's where you is, Joe.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.458
You all right, honey?
How they treatin' you?

32:11.540 --> 32:13.371
Fine, fine.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.532
- When d'you think you'll get out?
- I can't tell.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.732
They'll still send you to air school,
you'll see.

32:19.820 --> 32:24.052
- The truth is, Cindy...
- I know. Sergeant Brown told me.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.257
But it don't matter to me none.
I know you, Joe.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.092
I know you're done with that girl.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.250
Joe, there's a package for you.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.771
It must be from my maw.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.772
I wrote her
to bake something nice for you.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.050
Time's up. Prisoners fall in!

32:58.580 --> 33:00.059
Left face!

33:00.140 --> 33:02.290
Forward... March!

33:08.980 --> 33:11.096
Chow call! Come and get it!

33:40.420 --> 33:46.768
This flower
that you threw my way

33:46.860 --> 33:50.455
Has been my friend

33:50.540 --> 33:54.249
By night and day

33:54.340 --> 33:58.015
I saw it fade

33:58.100 --> 34:01.456
And lose its bloom

34:01.820 --> 34:05.893
But still it kept

34:05.980 --> 34:10.576
A sweet perfume

34:10.659 --> 34:12.810
In my cell

34:12.900 --> 34:17.212
Through every darkened hour

34:17.300 --> 34:21.134
On my lonely eyes

34:21.219 --> 34:24.496
Lay this flower

34:24.580 --> 34:31.656
And so I'd sleep
the whole night through

34:31.739 --> 34:36.574
And dream of you

34:36.659 --> 34:42.257
And dream of you

34:42.340 --> 34:45.297
Then I'd wake up

34:45.380 --> 34:49.054
With no-one near me

34:49.139 --> 34:55.978
And talk for the jail walls
to hear me

34:56.060 --> 34:59.291
She ain't the best

34:59.380 --> 35:02.531
They all the same

35:02.620 --> 35:06.579
Like all the rest

35:06.660 --> 35:11.450
She's just a dame

35:11.820 --> 35:17.213
Then I told myself
I was ravin'

35:17.300 --> 35:21.816
There was just one thing
I was cravin'

35:21.900 --> 35:24.289
It wasn't food

35:24.380 --> 35:26.735
It wasn't dough

35:26.820 --> 35:29.459
I guess you know

35:29.540 --> 35:32.100
That it was you

35:32.660 --> 35:39.372
You're all I'll ever crave

35:39.820 --> 35:44.894
And that's for true

35:44.980 --> 35:52.773
I don't know
anything about you

35:52.860 --> 36:00.130
I don't know much
about a shinin' star

36:00.500 --> 36:07.895
Just know
the worid is dark without you

36:07.980 --> 36:13.657
That's all I know

36:14.420 --> 36:21.053
I only want you as you are

36:22.900 --> 36:26.097
Carmen

36:26.740 --> 36:35.899
I love...

36:35.980 --> 36:44.615
You?

37:12.900 --> 37:14.731
Thanks for the lift, big oil man.

37:14.820 --> 37:18.096
Going as far as New Orleans, if you
wanna help the war effort, baby.

37:18.180 --> 37:20.250
I got my battle station.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.450
Anybody here ask for me?

37:46.540 --> 37:48.292
The whole Army, that's all.

37:48.380 --> 37:50.371
- Hi, Carmen.
- Hi.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.132
You know who I mean.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.176
No corporal by the name of Joe.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.973
Go, Mack!

38:05.500 --> 38:06.979
Go, Mack!

38:07.060 --> 38:09.255
Go, Mack!

38:09.340 --> 38:11.092
Go, Mack!

38:11.540 --> 38:12.859
Go, Mack!

38:28.700 --> 38:31.214
I'll tell you why I wanna dance

38:31.500 --> 38:34.333
It ain't the sweetness in the music

38:34.420 --> 38:37.173
I like the sweetness in the music

38:37.260 --> 38:40.058
But that ain't why I wanna dance

38:43.020 --> 38:45.170
It's something thumpin' in the bass

38:45.300 --> 38:48.212
That thump-thump thumping
on the music

38:48.300 --> 38:50.734
That bump-bump bumping
on the music

38:50.820 --> 38:52.219
Is all I need

38:52.300 --> 38:54.336
To start me off

38:54.420 --> 38:57.332
I don't need nothin' else...

38:57.420 --> 38:58.978
Maybe I do!

38:59.060 --> 39:02.575
To start me off

39:02.980 --> 39:05.448
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

39:05.540 --> 39:08.213
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

39:08.300 --> 39:10.768
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

39:10.860 --> 39:13.454
And I don't need no tune at all

39:13.540 --> 39:16.259
Beat me that rhythm on a drum

39:16.620 --> 39:19.134
Beat me that rhythm on a drum

39:19.420 --> 39:21.888
Beat me that rhythm on a drum

39:21.980 --> 39:24.369
And I don't need no tune at all

39:24.460 --> 39:25.688
A- all

39:25.780 --> 39:27.008
A- all

39:27.100 --> 39:28.328
A- all

39:28.420 --> 39:29.569
A- all

39:29.660 --> 39:32.333
I feel it beatin' in my bones

39:32.500 --> 39:35.173
It feel like 20 million tom-toms

39:35.260 --> 39:37.820
I know there's 20 million tom-toms

39:37.900 --> 39:40.289
Beatin' way down deep
inside my bones

39:43.180 --> 39:45.489
I feel it beatin' in my heart

39:45.580 --> 39:48.140
And then I get a kinda dream

39:48.220 --> 39:50.654
And in my dream it kinda seems

39:50.740 --> 39:52.059
There's one big heart

39:52.140 --> 39:54.176
In all the worid

39:54.260 --> 39:57.013
There ain't but one big heart...

39:58.460 --> 39:59.813
One heart.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.778
In all the worid

40:02.860 --> 40:05.454
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:05.540 --> 40:08.054
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:08.140 --> 40:10.415
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:10.500 --> 40:13.060
There's one big heart
in all the worid

40:13.140 --> 40:15.574
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:15.660 --> 40:18.015
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:18.100 --> 40:20.694
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

40:20.780 --> 40:24.375
There's one big heart
for all the worid

40:24.460 --> 40:25.734
Worid

40:25.820 --> 40:26.855
Worid

40:26.940 --> 40:28.498
Worid

40:28.580 --> 40:30.810
And now that heart is beating fast

40:30.900 --> 40:33.255
And that's a rhythm I can dance to

40:33.340 --> 40:35.979
I'm mighty glad I got a chance to

40:36.060 --> 40:38.415
With the one big heart
that's beating fast

40:40.900 --> 40:43.209
Tomorrow morning let it rain

40:43.300 --> 40:45.609
Tomorrow morning let it pour

40:45.700 --> 40:48.897
Tonight
we're in the groove together

40:49.260 --> 40:51.694
Ain't gonna worry 'bout

40:51.780 --> 40:55.056
Stormy weather

40:55.380 --> 40:57.974
Gonna kick ol' trouble

40:58.340 --> 41:01.412
Out the door

41:01.700 --> 41:03.930
Beat out that trouble on a drum

41:04.020 --> 41:06.580
Beat out ol' trouble on a drum

41:06.660 --> 41:08.890
Beat out ol' trouble on a drum

41:08.980 --> 41:11.448
And kick his carcass out the door

41:11.540 --> 41:13.929
Beat me that rhythm on a drum

41:14.020 --> 41:16.580
Beat me that rhythm on a drum

41:16.660 --> 41:19.015
Beat out that rhythm on a drum

41:19.100 --> 41:21.091
And kick ol' trouble out the door

41:21.180 --> 41:22.374
Kick him out the door

41:22.460 --> 41:23.529
Kick him out the door

41:23.620 --> 41:24.769
Kick him out the door

41:24.860 --> 41:27.738
Kick him out the door!?

41:38.460 --> 41:43.580
Charlie, give me
a double double on the rocks.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.938
- Hey, Jones gal.
- Hi, Carmen!

41:46.020 --> 41:47.453
- How's tricks?
- Ginger ale.

41:47.540 --> 41:48.893
Slow, Frankie.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.938
You still got a blowtorch
for that boy in the stockade?

41:52.020 --> 41:55.649
By now it ought to be so hot
you could send it to the Navy.

41:55.740 --> 41:58.459
They could use it
to weld battleships apart.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.653
That's how it is.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.492
Husky Miller!

42:27.340 --> 42:30.969
Thanks a lot, I'm sure glad to be

42:31.060 --> 42:32.778
To be where I can see

42:32.940 --> 42:35.295
So many friends of mine

42:35.820 --> 42:37.856
How've I been doin'?

42:37.940 --> 42:39.771
How've I been doin'?

42:40.180 --> 42:42.569
If you really want
to know the truth

42:42.660 --> 42:44.491
I'm doin' fine

42:45.020 --> 42:48.535
Seventeen decisions in a row

42:48.620 --> 42:50.690
And only five on points

42:50.780 --> 42:53.055
The rest was all KO

42:53.540 --> 42:55.496
Jackson and Johnson

42:55.580 --> 42:57.571
Murphy and Bronson

42:57.660 --> 42:58.888
One by one they come

42:58.980 --> 43:03.098
And one by one to dreamland they go

43:03.900 --> 43:05.413
How's it done?

43:05.500 --> 43:07.456
You ask me how's it done?

43:07.540 --> 43:09.610
I got a trainer man

43:09.700 --> 43:12.089
Who taught me all I know

43:12.180 --> 43:16.810
Sure feels good
to have him in my corner

43:16.900 --> 43:19.619
Hear his voice a-whisperin' low

43:19.700 --> 43:21.577
Big boy, remember

43:21.660 --> 43:27.018
You must remember

43:27.100 --> 43:30.979
Stand up and fight
until you hear the bell

43:31.060 --> 43:33.096
Stand toe to toe

43:33.180 --> 43:35.171
Trade blow for blow

43:35.260 --> 43:39.139
Keep punching
till you make your punches tell

43:39.220 --> 43:43.577
Show that crowd what you know

43:43.660 --> 43:45.537
Until you hear that bell

43:45.620 --> 43:47.576
That final bell

43:47.660 --> 43:50.857
Stand up and fight like hell

43:58.820 --> 44:02.733
When you fight
out in the open air

44:02.820 --> 44:07.416
In a patch of light,
the ring looks small and white

44:07.500 --> 44:09.695
Out in the blackness

44:09.780 --> 44:11.657
Out in the blackness

44:11.740 --> 44:14.698
You can feel
a hundred thousand eyes

44:14.780 --> 44:16.896
Fillin' the night

44:16.980 --> 44:20.814
Cigarettes are blinkin' in the dark

44:20.900 --> 44:25.655
And making polka dots
around the baseball park

44:25.740 --> 44:27.696
People are quiet

44:27.780 --> 44:29.771
Then there's a riot

44:29.860 --> 44:32.454
Someone throws a punch
and plants it right

44:32.540 --> 44:35.612
Smack on the mark

44:36.460 --> 44:37.859
Someone's hurt

44:37.940 --> 44:40.056
You kinda think it's you

44:40.140 --> 44:42.290
You hang across the ropes

44:42.380 --> 44:44.496
That's all you wanna do

44:45.260 --> 44:49.219
Then you look round
And see your trainer's eyes

44:49.300 --> 44:52.451
Beggin' you to see it through

44:52.540 --> 44:54.496
They say, remember

44:54.580 --> 44:59.779
Big boy, remember

44:59.860 --> 45:04.138
Stand up and fight
until you hear the bell

45:04.220 --> 45:06.176
Stand toe to toe

45:06.260 --> 45:08.330
Trade blow for blow

45:08.420 --> 45:12.299
Keep punchin'
till you make your punches tell

45:12.380 --> 45:16.817
Show that crowd what you know

45:16.900 --> 45:18.891
Until you hear that bell

45:18.980 --> 45:20.971
That final bell

45:21.060 --> 45:24.097
Stand up and fight like hell

45:24.180 --> 45:26.330
Stand up and fight

45:26.420 --> 45:29.856
Stand up and fight

45:29.940 --> 45:32.454
And fight

45:32.540 --> 45:39.412
Like hell?

45:39.700 --> 45:42.453
Three cheers for Husky Miller,
the comin' champion of the worid!

45:42.540 --> 45:44.371
Hooray!

45:44.460 --> 45:45.813
Drinks for everybody in the house.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.016
Inform the gentleman behind the bar.

45:48.100 --> 45:49.692
Set 'em up drinks on Husky Miller!

45:51.460 --> 45:53.416
Hello, Heat Wave. Introduce yourself.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.210
You talk like you know me already.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.894
I noticed you right off,
up on the balcony.

45:58.980 --> 46:00.538
Did you notice me?

46:00.620 --> 46:02.099
Why, no.

46:02.180 --> 46:05.456
You was acting so bashful
I didn't hardly know you was there.

46:05.620 --> 46:06.973
Hey, you talkin' to the champ.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.096
He just <i>looks</i> at a chick
and she's down for...

46:09.180 --> 46:12.217
- Shut your teeth!
- Excuse my dust, gentlemen.

46:12.300 --> 46:15.975
The air's getting
mighty unconditioned around here.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.136
What are you paid forTo manage me
or to KO me with the dames?

46:20.220 --> 46:24.975
This chick needs a big investment
in time, and your train is waiting.

46:25.060 --> 46:27.972
- It don't leave for an hour yet.
- It's at the station.

46:28.060 --> 46:31.814
Remember, you promised the trainer
ten hours' shuteye.

46:33.300 --> 46:36.417
OK. I ain't gonna break
no promise to him,

46:36.500 --> 46:38.730
but you listen to this
and listen good.

46:38.820 --> 46:41.539
When I wake up tomorrow
in Chicago and get off that train,

46:41.620 --> 46:43.770
I wanna see Heat Wave
on the platform.

46:43.860 --> 46:46.090
Suppose she don't want
to go to Chicago?

46:46.420 --> 46:48.172
That's your toothache.

46:48.260 --> 46:51.730
If you can't show up with her,
find yourself a new meal ticket.

46:51.820 --> 46:54.618
- Good night, all!
- Good night, Husky!

46:54.700 --> 46:58.409
What's he mean, "Go find yourself
a new meal ticket"?

46:58.500 --> 47:03.176
He means I don't eat. And, brother,
if I don't eat, you starve.

47:03.260 --> 47:07.094
Come on, Myrt,
let's go where the money is.

47:07.740 --> 47:12.336
I believe we had this parking space
reserved, but don't get up, please.

47:14.940 --> 47:17.408
Don't these gentlemen look like
they met us someplace before?

47:17.500 --> 47:19.650
I could swear I met 'em
with Husky Miller.

47:19.740 --> 47:22.857
- Where d'you know Husky from?
- Oh, maybe New York, New Orleans.

47:22.940 --> 47:25.135
What you doin'
in this hamburger joint?

47:25.220 --> 47:28.451
- Just passin' through.
- Then you don't know nobody here?

47:28.540 --> 47:30.098
Who d'you want us to know?

47:30.180 --> 47:31.977
Thought you might be
acquainted with her.

47:32.060 --> 47:35.655
Carmen That's my best friend.
What d'you want with her?

47:35.740 --> 47:38.538
Just asking. Won't you pull up
to the kerb and park?

47:38.620 --> 47:41.293
- If you insist.
- I do. Indeed I do.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.416
Uh, drinks for the ladies.

47:44.580 --> 47:46.810
- What kind?
- Ask 'em.

47:46.900 --> 47:49.255
- You made up your minds yet?
- Anything light.

47:49.340 --> 47:52.776
- You mean with bubbles?
- ChampagneMy, that's too splurgy.

47:52.860 --> 47:54.054
Frankie!

47:54.140 --> 47:56.131
Not for Rum Daniels,
manager of Husky Miller.

47:56.220 --> 47:57.972
You his manager, for real?

47:58.060 --> 48:01.097
- And this is Dink Franklin...
- The manager's manager.

48:01.180 --> 48:03.489
Large bottle of Champagne,
from the bottom cellar.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.172
Sure, Mr Daniels.

48:05.260 --> 48:08.218
Too bad we're leaving for Chicago
in an hour.

48:08.300 --> 48:10.575
Hardly got time to trade punches.

48:10.660 --> 48:13.094
Would you care to stop off
in the Windy City with us?

48:13.180 --> 48:14.932
What's the proposition?

48:15.020 --> 48:18.217
She mean, you talking to us like
we was a pair of you know what!

48:18.300 --> 48:20.336
I had nothing like that in mind.

48:20.420 --> 48:24.413
Just thinkin' it would be nice to
have your company in a drawing room,

48:24.500 --> 48:27.094
showin' you around
the fancy stores in Chicago,

48:27.180 --> 48:29.410
footin' the bill for some of
the things you might want to buy,

48:29.500 --> 48:31.775
like a diamond ring and a mink coat.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.213
Mink?!

48:33.300 --> 48:36.576
Course, if that ain't good enough,
maybe there's another kind of fur.

48:36.660 --> 48:40.289
No. We're old-fashioned.
Mink and diamonds suits us fine.

48:40.380 --> 48:42.177
- Then it's settled.
- Let's get going.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.773
Don't wanna miss that train.

48:43.860 --> 48:48.695
Yeah, go pack. While you're at it,
pack up your friend there, too.

48:48.780 --> 48:51.613
- Carmen?
- For Husky Miller.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.658
And if she says no?

48:53.740 --> 48:57.494
Then ain't none of us
gettin' on that train.

48:57.580 --> 48:59.457
I get it.

48:59.540 --> 49:01.735
Figured you would.

49:01.820 --> 49:03.173
Well, come on.

49:03.260 --> 49:06.969
But don't everybody
start talkin' at once.

49:07.980 --> 49:11.939
Miss Jones, this is Rum, Husky's
manager. And Dink, <i>his</i> manager.

49:12.020 --> 49:15.251
They're taking me and Frankie
to Chicago, in a drawing room.

49:15.340 --> 49:16.489
That's nice.

49:16.580 --> 49:19.140
Reserved the biggest suite on
the top floor of the biggest hotel.

49:19.220 --> 49:21.495
- Gonna buy us fancy clothes.
- Diamonds and mink!

49:21.580 --> 49:23.730
We'll be livin' off
the fatheads of the land.

49:23.820 --> 49:25.458
The fatheads of fatheads.

49:25.540 --> 49:29.374
We've room for one more. Care
to join us at Husky's invitation?

49:29.460 --> 49:32.532
Hear that, honeyHe askin' you
to come to Chicago with us.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.372
Keep us company.

49:34.820 --> 49:38.608
- Chicago.
- Man, we'll have ourselves a ball!

49:38.700 --> 49:41.214
All expenses paid
including the little extras.

49:41.300 --> 49:44.019
Like a storeful of diamonds and
fancy clothes and everything nice.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.331
- For true?
- That ain't the half of it.

49:48.260 --> 49:52.458
You take us to Chicago, show us
a good time. What we gotta do for it?

49:52.540 --> 49:55.657
Don't ask him that now, honey.
Let's get to Chicago first.

49:55.740 --> 49:57.458
What do you say, Heat Wave?

49:57.540 --> 50:00.213
Wanna make a trip
on a crack Chicago train

50:00.300 --> 50:01.653
That's a trip you ought to make

50:01.740 --> 50:03.219
It won't be hard for you to take

50:03.300 --> 50:05.939
Travel 'bout as fast
as a Kansas hurricane

50:06.020 --> 50:08.898
It only takes a half a day
to be a thousand miles away

50:08.980 --> 50:11.210
- Away, away
- Come on, come on

50:11.300 --> 50:14.258
That streamline engine won't delay

50:14.340 --> 50:17.059
- Away, away
- Come on, come on

50:17.140 --> 50:20.098
That streamline engine won't delay

50:20.180 --> 50:22.899
That streamline engine
just can't wait

50:22.980 --> 50:25.813
That streamline engine
ain't no freight

50:25.900 --> 50:29.495
That streamline engine
won't be late

50:29.900 --> 50:31.128
Whizzing away along the track

50:31.220 --> 50:32.573
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack

50:32.660 --> 50:34.139
Leavin' the wind away in back

50:34.220 --> 50:35.494
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack

50:35.580 --> 50:38.458
Up a hill and down a hill
And out upon the plains again

50:38.540 --> 50:41.213
Through a storm and outta the storm
and pretty soon it rains again

50:41.300 --> 50:44.053
It only takes a half a day
To be a thousand miles away

50:44.140 --> 50:47.416
It only takes a half a day
To be a thousand miles away, away

50:47.500 --> 50:51.379
- Come on, away
- Chicago, Chicago

50:51.460 --> 50:54.293
- Away, away
- To come away, to come away

50:54.380 --> 50:56.018
Hey!

50:56.100 --> 50:57.533
On a Chicago train?

50:58.260 --> 51:00.376
Go pack your duds.
Ain't got much time.

51:00.460 --> 51:02.928
- Carmen'll come.
- I knew she would.

51:03.020 --> 51:04.931
Well, let's get going.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.295
Wait! Let me say my say

51:09.740 --> 51:12.379
If you're bustin' to go, then go

51:12.460 --> 51:15.213
But just count me out of the party

51:15.300 --> 51:17.131
Just count me out

51:18.100 --> 51:20.011
Cos I ain't in

51:20.100 --> 51:22.489
Ah, Carmen, honey, have a heart

51:22.580 --> 51:24.536
Don't want no part of it,
don't want no part of it

51:24.620 --> 51:25.609
Don't want no part!

51:25.700 --> 51:28.089
Don't waste our time
with all this fuss

51:28.180 --> 51:30.216
Don't want no part of it,
don't want no part of it

51:30.300 --> 51:31.733
Don't want no part

51:31.820 --> 51:36.894
What you got that you like
so much better than this?

51:36.980 --> 51:38.379
- What ya got?
- What ya got?

51:38.460 --> 51:41.213
What ya got, what ya got?

51:41.300 --> 51:45.816
If I told you, you'd only laugh

51:45.900 --> 51:47.811
- Oh, no
- Not me

51:47.900 --> 51:49.572
- Go on
- Give out

51:49.660 --> 51:53.938
You got to promise not to laugh

51:55.060 --> 51:56.413
OK

51:57.100 --> 51:58.419
OK

51:58.740 --> 52:04.292
Dere's a man I'm crazy for

52:05.660 --> 52:07.491
She's got a man she's crazy for!

52:07.580 --> 52:09.138
That's why she can't come to Chicago.

52:09.220 --> 52:10.858
That's a laugh!

52:10.940 --> 52:13.170
I'm in love

52:13.260 --> 52:15.820
And dat ain't no laugh

52:17.900 --> 52:21.415
Well, shut my mouth
and call me dumb

52:21.500 --> 52:24.617
And beat me! I'm a kettledrum

52:24.700 --> 52:28.454
The birdies
in the trees are hummin'

52:28.540 --> 52:31.577
Carmen's in love, Carmen's in love

52:31.660 --> 52:34.936
Still we ask, won't you come?

52:35.020 --> 52:38.217
And break your date
Give the gate to your chum?

52:38.780 --> 52:42.216
Another night, I might've come

52:42.300 --> 52:45.656
To raise some pandemonium

52:45.740 --> 52:49.335
But now
the mockingbirds are hummin'

52:49.420 --> 52:52.571
Carmen's in love, Carmen's in love

52:52.660 --> 52:56.130
Leave me here with my Joe

52:56.220 --> 52:58.973
Take your train to Chicago and go

52:59.060 --> 53:01.654
- We gotta get you on that train
- Some other time

53:01.740 --> 53:04.573
What makes you think
there'll be another time?

53:04.660 --> 53:07.697
What makes you think
there'll be another time?

53:08.180 --> 53:09.613
- To get a trip
- To get a trip

53:09.700 --> 53:11.053
- To Illinois
- To Illinois

53:11.140 --> 53:13.700
- And get it free?
- And get it free?

53:13.780 --> 53:20.174
Dat is the place
that I'd sure like to see

53:21.260 --> 53:22.488
Whizzing away along the track

53:22.580 --> 53:23.774
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack

53:23.860 --> 53:25.134
Leavin' the wind away in back

53:25.220 --> 53:26.448
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack

53:26.540 --> 53:29.134
Up a hill and down a hill
And out upon the plains again

53:29.220 --> 53:31.859
Through a storm and outta the storm
and pretty soon it rains again

53:31.940 --> 53:34.295
It only takes a half a day
To be a thousand miles away

53:34.380 --> 53:37.452
It only takes a half a day
To be a thousand miles away, away

53:37.540 --> 53:41.089
- Come on, away
- Chicago! Chicago!

53:41.180 --> 53:43.740
- Away, away
- Come on away, come on away

53:43.820 --> 53:45.219
Hey!

53:45.300 --> 53:46.574
Whizzing away along the track

53:46.660 --> 53:48.969
Off to Chicago

53:49.060 --> 53:54.373
Illinois?

53:55.420 --> 53:58.412
Well, Carmen, what's the count?
You comin' with us?

53:58.500 --> 54:00.138
I always did wanna see the big town.

54:00.220 --> 54:03.849
You got your wish, honey.
Chicago's gonna be real good for you.

54:03.940 --> 54:07.091
You gonna be real <i>bad</i> for Chicago.

54:07.180 --> 54:08.852
You comin'?

54:09.700 --> 54:10.928
Uh-uh.

54:11.020 --> 54:12.533
Look, baby. Let's talk turkey.

54:12.620 --> 54:16.135
I gotta produce you in Chicago,
and I don't care what it costs me.

54:16.220 --> 54:19.371
You name it, Husky'll sign the bill.
I know that boy.

54:19.460 --> 54:21.416
When he goes crazy for a chick,

54:21.500 --> 54:25.015
she starts looking like a neon sign,
all lit up with diamonds.

54:25.100 --> 54:27.216
Diamonds ain't what I want of a man.

54:27.300 --> 54:30.258
If I love him,
he don't need no chequebook.

54:30.340 --> 54:32.808
If I don't, chequebook ain't gonna
do him no good.

54:32.900 --> 54:34.936
Who's talkin' about love?

54:35.020 --> 54:38.330
We don't care what happens between
you and Husky once we're in Chicago.

54:38.420 --> 54:41.571
If he don't appeal to you, well,
ain't nobody's fault.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.733
It ain't that he don't appeal to me.
But he rang my bell when I'm busy.

54:45.820 --> 54:49.813
BusyFooling around here when
you got a chance to go to Chicago?

54:49.900 --> 54:54.178
Are you gonna stay here and sleep
or wake up and come with us?

54:54.260 --> 54:56.649
I'm gonna wait here for Joe.

54:56.740 --> 54:59.732
Been waitin' a month.
Bet he don't never show up.

54:59.820 --> 55:01.776
He'll come. Soon as they let him out.

55:01.860 --> 55:05.375
Look, Miss Jones, in case you wise up
before the train leaves,

55:05.460 --> 55:07.655
here's a ticket for drawing room A.

55:07.740 --> 55:12.131
Right over the wheels. You can hear
yourself click-clicking to Chicago.

55:13.260 --> 55:16.730
- No use wastin' it.
- Just castin' bread on the waters.

55:16.820 --> 55:18.219
Come on, brother and sisters,

55:18.300 --> 55:21.019
join the prayer meeting
in drawing room E.

55:21.100 --> 55:24.137
Don't let too much distance
come between you and that money.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.051
Come on, honey.

55:45.020 --> 55:46.169
Joe!

55:54.220 --> 55:55.653
Joey!

56:12.340 --> 56:14.729
I was afraid you wouldn't be here.

56:14.820 --> 56:17.380
I've been here every night
waitin' for you.

56:17.460 --> 56:19.416
They ain't after you no more?

56:19.500 --> 56:22.060
I got a suspended sentence.

56:22.140 --> 56:24.415
Felt like you wasn't ever
gettin' out.

56:39.900 --> 56:44.894
Thinkin' about you all the time,
while you was away from me.

56:45.980 --> 56:48.369
I been dreamin' about tonight

56:48.460 --> 56:52.738
and wondering if you would be feelin'
half as lovin'

56:53.580 --> 56:56.174
as your Carmen feels for you.

56:57.060 --> 57:00.336
Carmen,
there's something you gotta know.

57:03.500 --> 57:07.618
Tell me later,
when Carmen takes you home with her.

57:08.900 --> 57:11.892
Carmen will unlace your shoes...

57:11.980 --> 57:15.097
That's just it.
I can't stay or go with you.

57:15.180 --> 57:17.535
I gotta report right back
to the base.

57:17.620 --> 57:19.178
What?

57:19.260 --> 57:21.694
I gotta get that bus
leaving for flying school.

57:21.780 --> 57:25.170
Captain Halldale, my CO,
he got my court martial reduced

57:25.260 --> 57:27.899
and made 'em take me back
into flying school.

57:27.980 --> 57:31.290
Where does that leave us?
How far apart?

57:31.380 --> 57:33.177
Only 400 miles.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.409
Only?!

57:34.500 --> 57:36.968
You can come up when I got a pass.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.576
Boy, if that ain't one on Carmen!

57:39.660 --> 57:41.730
Love on a pass!

57:44.740 --> 57:46.014
Carmen...

57:46.100 --> 57:48.739
Go to flying school!
Take off right now!

57:48.820 --> 57:52.096
Then lay in your bunk,
look up at them pin-up gals!

57:52.180 --> 57:54.899
See what that gets you,
droopy drawers!

57:56.860 --> 57:59.135
I got something I want you to see.

58:04.580 --> 58:07.572
That's been with me all the time.

58:08.020 --> 58:10.409
Right here, where you are.

58:12.340 --> 58:14.376
That don't ring so true.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.690
I swear it's true.

58:22.700 --> 58:25.578
Joe, if you loved me true,
know what you'd do?

58:25.660 --> 58:28.254
- What?
- You'd come to Chicago.

58:28.340 --> 58:31.616
- Chicago?
- I got enough dough for us both.

58:31.700 --> 58:36.296
And a ticket too. I been savin' up
to give my man a real good time.

58:36.380 --> 58:39.099
You know I can't just pick up and go
like that.

58:39.180 --> 58:41.740
Joe, I want to go someplace

58:41.820 --> 58:44.175
where you're the last thing
I see at night,

58:44.700 --> 58:46.656
first thing I see in the morning.

58:47.500 --> 58:49.456
I can't go AWOL.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.691
You're just taking some time off

58:51.780 --> 58:54.374
so we can be together
before you go away.

58:54.820 --> 58:57.778
That's not the way
the Army'd look at it.

58:58.900 --> 59:01.937
Boy, if you ain't a lover
red-hot for Carmen.

59:02.020 --> 59:04.170
You just burnin' up with passión!

59:04.260 --> 59:06.490
You sizzle like a fish on ice!

59:08.020 --> 59:10.136
I can't afford no more demerits.

59:10.220 --> 59:14.771
If I step out of line again, I'll
never make officers' flying school.

59:14.860 --> 59:16.657
You know what?

59:16.740 --> 59:19.129
You too chicken
for me to waste my time on!

59:19.220 --> 59:21.336
Chicken is right.

59:24.900 --> 59:27.130
Look at that officer material.

59:27.220 --> 59:31.611
You got as much chance of being
a flyer as a flea inside that shirt.

59:32.900 --> 59:34.618
You quit that!

59:34.700 --> 59:36.930
That's no kinda man for you, Carmen.

59:37.020 --> 59:40.615
He can't even keep his shirt
in his pants.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.452
- You do that again, and I'll...
- You'll what?

59:42.540 --> 59:45.498
You ain't thinkin' on strikin'
your sergeant, I hope?

59:45.580 --> 59:50.495
That wouldn't be four weeks in
the guardhouse, more like four years.

59:50.700 --> 59:54.136
How about it, sugar?
We got lost time to make up.

59:54.740 --> 59:56.890
Let's get started.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.172
You keep your paws off her.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.455
Who's gonna make me?

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.293
Run along, Lt Caspar Milquetoast.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.896
Looks like he's hurt real bad!

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.095
Yeah.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.774
Four years for hitting a superior,
ain't that what he said?

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.339
Maybe more.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.615
Get him in them bushes! Hurry.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.533
- They're bound to find him.
- By that time, we'll be far away.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.737
- I can't. That's deserting.
- If they find you, that's prison.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.334
What you got to loseCome on, man.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:45.897
Get a move on, Joe!
Gotta make that train!

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.899
Who's that?

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.448
Husky Miller, the fighter.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.815
I met him at Billy Pastor's
with Frankie and Myrt.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.775
Blow on 'em, sugar.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.930
Make 'em dry faster.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.850
You can turn the heat off now.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.531
Ah, man, that tickles!

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.736
You some harmonica player!

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.416
What a mosquito bite.

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.375
Why the camouflage?
You don't need it with me.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.090
Hand me them nylons, honey.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.655
You ain't goin' out?

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.095
Far as the grocery store.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.898
Gotta feed my man.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.936
Look, Carmen...

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.488
I don't know how to tell you, but...

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.296
I'm busted. I gave the last of my pay
to the landlady.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.690
I got some jingly stuff.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.736
I ain't gonna let you shell out.

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.817
We gotta eat, growin' boy.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.856
Not on your dough.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.416
What's mine's yours, Joey.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.571
And that goes right down the line.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.011
If I could only get out.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.573
With them military cops on your tail?

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.576
They'd grab you so fast,

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.292
I'd still be kissin' the breeze
goodbye

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.814
when you's in Leavenworth.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.414
Easy, honey, easy.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.128
- You're two bits shy.
- Charge it to Husky.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.851
And you discovered Husky?

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.612
To the stars belong the credit.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.090
I was on the New York waterfront,
sellin' $1 m of War Bonds,

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:37.095
when I see this big boy walking along
carrying a Jeep... with one hand!

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.377
You know what I said to myself then?
I said "That's my man!"

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.894
That's just what he said.
Put that in your column.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.698
Heat Wave, be with you in no time!

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.772
Look who's here!
The answer to our prayers.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.498
If it ain't the Jones gal!

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:53.050
- Hi, Frankie!
- Where you been all week?

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.812
Around, having myself a time.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.652
WhereIn a bargain basement?

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.335
Get a loada me! Look at this iceberg!
It's almost real.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.732
But that ain't nothing
compared to what's driftin' your way.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.015
I came to ask you for a little loan.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.375
You... you bustedFlat?

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.894
Yeah. Can you let me have
a couple of bills?

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.369
You talkin' to the wrong party.
There's your bank.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:19.375
You just tell Husky what you want
and don't stop,

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.099
cos he's percolating
to take care of you <i>real</i> good.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.696
Now this manager's gotta manage
something special for the Champ.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.771
Got all that I need. Thanks.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.929
Miss Jones!
This is our pleasure, indeed.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.012
Hi, honey!
You sure showed up in time.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.091
We can't get no more outta Husky.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.648
She means Husky's got his mind
set on finding you.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.093
How you been, Myrt?

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.410
Great while we were buying out
all the biggest stores,

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.730
but now Husky's
stopped all charge accounts.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.539
You'll be raiding 'em again
with Miss Jones.

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:52.056
Boss, I told you I'd produce her.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.337
Hello, Jelly Roll. Where you been
wasting time away from me?

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.652
Into the dressing room! Go on, get!
You wanna catch a draft?

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.449
Can't fight with my trainer.
Stay put. I'll be out in no time.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.418
Then you and me'll start
the second Chicago fire.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.735
You all set, honey. Just like being
partners with the US Mint.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.574
- All you gotta do is grab.
- I'm not here for that punching bag.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.448
- Don't you like Husky?
- He just one man too late, is all.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.612
- You still with that soldier boy?
- You staking me or not?

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.338
Sorry, honey. I'm flat too.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.333
All I got is fancy clothes, diamonds
and mink, that's all Rum gives me.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.095
Come with me, and maybe
I can promote some cash-and-carry.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.454
I'll wait here.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.579
You gotta be sociable with Husky
or I'll get nowhere with his manager.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.458
- Dust off the divan for the lady.
- Yes, Mr Daniels.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:44.453
Look at that physique. Bet your
soldier boy's got nothing like it.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:49.136
The better man won, huh?
Glad to know you're only human.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.256
Get this and get it right.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.171
I didn't come here
to stay in your corner.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.139
- Say that again.
- She's too bashful to admit it.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.450
Oh, that's different.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.169
You gettin' me that loan, or
do I have to listen to more braggin'?

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.979
- What loan?
- For clothes and things...

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.211
Put a raid on the stores.
Just name it and charge it.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.689
Thanks, Frankie, but it won't work.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.975
What is thisWhere you goin'?

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.858
- Sorry, Carmen ain't for sale.
- Heat Wave, wait!

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:21.649
You just relax them classy muscles.
Leave that gal to me.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.493
It ain't my fault. You know females
are always changing their stripes.

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:30.017
Get out. Don't come back till you
bring Heat Wave with you for good.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.408
And that goes for your manager too.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.331
Carmen! Hey, Carmen!

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.856
I hate to see a hep chick like you
acting like a dumb cluck.

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:43.374
- Be sensible.
- Frankie.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.212
OK, keep your soldier boy,

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:50.090
but don't walk out on a private
convertible and gold-lace nightgowns.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.250
You know two-timing ain't my speed.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.694
Shift gears and join the female race:

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:57.578
Keep one man for the ride
and one for the money.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.491
Uh-uh.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.216
Listen, honey. I'll level with you.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:07.532
If you don't show up for Husky,
Myrt and I are right out in the cold.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.611
How about it, sugarFor us?

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.417
Ain't that I don't want to help you.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.968
- Only?
- I can't.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.258
LoveNobody lives on that street
forever, not with the same man.

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.808
You're bound to move,
maybe sooner than you think.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:23.095
Let you know when I get the message.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:26.809
Well, when you do, ring me
at the hotel. Here's the number.

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.970
Don't wait too long, Heat Wave, or
Husky liable to start blowing cold.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.368
- See you.
- OK.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.055
What took you so long?

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.973
- I had to wait for it.
- All that time?

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.010
- You been gone ever since...
- I got back as soon as I could.

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.091
It's a lot of stuff.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.770
All you had was some loose change
when you went out.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.169
Where'd the rest come from?

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.578
What's the difference?

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.457
I wanna know.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.732
Well?

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.456
Look, boy. Don't go puttin' me
on no stand.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.690
I don't answer to nobody.

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.850
If you got nothing to hide...

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.939
Do you think I do?

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.056
What do you expect me to think?

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.096
Why don't you tell me?

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.136
You think what you want!

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.657
- I don't account to no man.
- You're accounting to me.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.499
- I love you. I have the right...
- You've no right to own me.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.615
There's only one that does,
and that's me.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.258
Myself.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.570
Where you goin'?

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.413
- I <i>might</i> come back.
- Carmen, I'm sorry.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.578
Carmen.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.252
Carmen!

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.492
That racket, it's enough
to drive rivets into your head.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.098
You're goin' out again?

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.418
Feel like takin' a walk.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.130
- You already had one today.
- Feel like another one.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.933
Look, honey, I'm sorry
for the way I blew off.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.499
You're spillin' it.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.014
But that ain't no reason
to turn on the ice.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.888
Look, boy, I don't have
to keep the truth from nobody.

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.936
I can't stand bein' cooped up
in this alley no more.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.729
But you know the MPs are after me.
I've got to stay in here.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.893
You gotta.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.698
I don't.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.294
What does that mean?

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:37.176
I'm bustin' out for a while.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.216
Who with?

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.657
- You really want to know?
- Well, I asked you.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.131
I'll tell ya. With a friend of mine.
Frankie.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.372
That gal that works at Billy
Pastor'sWhat's she doing here?

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.016
She's with that Husky Miller crowd,
got here when we did.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.260
My seams on straight?

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.536
Who's she throwing your way?

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.258
You ain't goin' nowhere.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.570
You're stayin' where you belong,
with me!

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.255
I don't get it. This place suited you
fine before you went out.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.055
What happened in between?

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.132
Got a whiff of fresh air,
that's what happened.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.017
Just wanna get more of it.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.136
Not without me!

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.089
Maybe you ain't got the message yet.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.374
But Carmen's one gal
nobody puts on a leash.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.611
No man's gonna tell me
when can I come and go.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.973
I gotta be free,
or I don't stay at all.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.176
You talk like this was a jail.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.578
- You makin' it one.
- It ain't to me.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.699
I could stay here and never go out
as long as you're here.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.056
But when you ain't,
it's worse than jail.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.176
There ain't no light, no air.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.690
Suppose I never come back?

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.735
You'd never get away from me.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.337
I'd follow you down the rivers
or across the sea.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.331
To hell or up to heaven.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.610
Why'd you ask?

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.095
Just to hear you say it.

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.572
You're hurtin' me, Joe.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.378
I'm sorry, honey.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.691
I didn't mean to.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.090
Get back soon.
And remember, I'm waitin'.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:42.097
You just keep a light
burning in the window, boy.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:03.854
Poor Champ. Can't have no
happy juice, no good time, nothin'.

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.489
Just gotta keep trainin'
to keep in trainin'.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.253
Wanna break it for fun
and see what happens?

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.017
Take the count.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.337
- Get me some more.
- You already had one Seltzer bottle.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.934
Make this one for the road.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.296
You can't have skirts in your head
before the big night.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.291
You gotta forget that woman.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.848
I'm tryin', trainin' man. I'm tryin'.

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.137
Hi, Husk.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.771
I said keep outta my corner. You're
fired till you bring me Heat Wave.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.819
You just got to give Rum
the teletype, boss. There she is.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.332
Heat Wave!

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.613
Easy, boy. Don't KO me in round one.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.578
- Give the fans their money's worth.
- Tell my fortune.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.652
- Let's go warm up a corner.
- I wanna watch.

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.095
Am I gonna get that certain party?

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.172
No way to tell in advance,
but the cards don't lie.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.330
- Cut them
- Cut them

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.535
- Seven
- Seven

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.896
- That's quite a card
- Yes, that's quite a card

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.378
Do you mean good or bad?

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.018
That's the queen of hearts.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.137
- Quiet, please!
- Quiet, please

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.936
You're gonna get a lot of money.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:25.933
I don't know how you'll spend it all
but it's a lot of money!

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:29.729
Will this gal see
a bright and happy future?

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.415
Or will she be
a good-for-nothin' moocher?

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.172
Come on, you cards,
and tell her true

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.852
Come on, you cards,
and tell her true

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.419
And tell her how she's gonna do

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.218
And tell her how she's gonna do

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.815
For good or bad, for high or low

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.175
Come on, you cards,
and let her know

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.694
Whatever way the wind will blow

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.013
All set?

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.649
All set.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.972
For sure?

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.937
Let's go!

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:03.610
Let's see what they say about me

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.849
Oh, you gonna get a good man,
Carmen.

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.258
Yeah.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.171
Here's your little secret.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.458
The nine of spades.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.659
De nine

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.490
Dere he is

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.616
De ol' boy

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.772
Plain as can be

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.771
Death got his hand

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.535
On me

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.891
It ain't no use to run away

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.052
From dat ol' boy

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:15.657
If he is chasin' you

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.450
It's best to stand right up

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:25.011
And look him in de face

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:30.010
When he is facin' you

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:39.260
You gotta be prepared
to go with dat ol' boy

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.096
No matter what the time

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.540
So I won't fill my pretty eyes

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.930
With salty tears

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:59.454
Cos I ain't got de time

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:07.491
I'm gonna run out
every second I got left

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:11.739
Before he throws me down

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:19.978
I'm gonna laugh and sing
and use up all my breath

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:24.657
Before he mows me down

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.577
While I can fly around

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:34.451
I'll do my flying high

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:42.138
I'm gonna keep on livin'

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:48.535
Up to the day I die

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.775
De nine

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.857
Hello

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.056
OI' boy

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.254
Hello?

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.652
<i>My Joe</i>

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:33.800
<i>He was always my Joe</i>

01:20:33.835 --> 01:20:36.825
and use up all my breath

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.932
<i>Joe said there never could be</i>

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.854
<i>We was in love</i>

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.455
<i>And I reckon we showed it</i>

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:50.577
<i>From the way people talked</i>

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.858
<i>Reckon everyone knowed it</i>

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.778
<i>Kids on the street where we'd go</i>

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.657
<i>Used to yell at us</i>

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:07.576
<i>"Cindy Lou belongs to Joe!"</i>

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.856
<i>Lord! O Lord!</i>

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.331
<i>You know that was true</i>

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.817
<i>And Joey belonged</i>

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.815
<i>To Cindy Lou</i> ?

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:29.094
We wanna check on his pass. He's
been shacking up here for a week.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.729
- I run a respectable place.
- Ain't sayin' you don't.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.015
Take a look at this picture.

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.330
Does he live here?

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.934
One flight up. Room 24.

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.778
You're too late, miss. Husky's
finished trainin' for the day.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.091
I'm looking for someone the papers
say he's runnin' around with.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.818
- Is her name Carmen?
- That too.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.290
She's in his dressing room now,
right in there, to the left.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:31.813
Thank you.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.488
Sorry, we got all the toothbrushes
we need, little lady.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.493
Wait. I'm here to see
Miss Carmen Jones. Please.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.059
Me?

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.055
Say, ain't you that little gal
Joe was stuck on?

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.132
Yes. I came here
to find out where he is.

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.892
You the only one that know.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:07.696
Nice gal like you gonna get into
trouble taking up with a deserter.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:11.455
I don't care what he done. I gotta
find him before the military do.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.292
Tell me where he is, please.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.738
Joe!

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.694
So you ran out on me.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.409
Sure. He can give you a better time
than I can.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.650
Fancy clothes...

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:03.937
swell company, the whole works.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.775
Husky Miller's latest woman.

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.579
Only that ain't the way
it's gonna be.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.491
We's all washed up.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.855
Go away.
Go with this sweet little gal.

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.615
You'd like that, I guess,
so it'd leave you free to play.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.529
Only you're coming with me,
where you belong.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.178
Put a hand on Carmen again
and I'll immobilise you.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.774
- Joe, don't fight with him.
- Leave me alone.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.135
- Who is this jerk, anyhow?
- You shut your fat trap!

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.495
- You double-crossin' tramp!
- What'd you call her?

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.299
- Husky, you'll kill him!
- If it's the last thing I do!

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.177
Husky, that won't be
the last thing you do.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:37.059
- I swore I'd let no man take you!
- How you gonna stop me?

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.938
- I'll show you!
- No! You's in enough trouble!

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:41.851
- Cindy, go away.
- Somebody get the police!

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.851
- Dink, what you waitin' on?
- Stay put!

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.339
Joe, honey, listen!

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.571
I ain't no good to ya, Cindy. Go home
to your maw where you belong.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.776
Put that thing away, boy.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.612
Ain't gonna get you nowhere with me.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.895
Nor with him neither!

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.689
That's enough, Husky!
That's enough!

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.498
One more crack!

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.852
The MPs!

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.416
Get out the back way! Go on!

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:18.295
- You're comin' with me.
- She ain't goin' nowhere with you.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.531
- I said we was washed up.
- Why you helpin' me get away?

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.611
Cos I can't stand nobody
bein' cooped up!

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.851
- Right this way, gentlemen.
- Just keep goin'.

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.291
Go on home. Forget him.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.530
Bait your hook for fish you can fry.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:07.654
How can I love a man

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.851
When I know he don't want me?

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.578
He ain't been good

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.776
He ain't been kind

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.012
He give me up

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:25.494
For that old roadside woman

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:34.335
But I can't drive him
from my mind

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:38.979
I's scared, O Lord, I's scared

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.134
I's like a leaf
that's lost her tree

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:47.418
I's alone, O Lord, I's alone

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:56.535
He got hisself
another woman

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.415
Did she feel his arms

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.812
All around her?

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:09.418
No, Lord, I can't believe it's so

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:14.858
No, Lord,
don't you let her keep my Joe

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.295
Make him throw her back

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:19.257
Where he found her

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.739
Joe!

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:25.940
You said that both your arms
was mine

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:29.217
Remember?

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:33.328
You said your arms

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:36.617
Was mine

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:42.252
I's...

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.729
Your gal

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:47.857
I was always your gal

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.295
There was no-one but me

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.372
You said there never could be

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:57.169
We was in love

01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.457
And I reckon we showed it

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.213
From the way people talked

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:07.771
Reckon everyone knowed it

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.891
Kids on the street where we'd go

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.618
Used to yell at us

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:20.377
"Cindy Lou belongs to Joe!"

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.570
Lord, O Lord

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:27.290
Look down and try to see

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.736
How you can make Joe

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:33.493
Come home

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.617
To me

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:41.293
O Lord, look down

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.099
Lead my Joe

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.456
Off the road

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:53.012
Where he's strayin'

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.093
Oh, tell my man

01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:00.657
Where to go

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:07.054
O Lord, I's callin'

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:13.655
On

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.652
You?

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.770
Poncho! Poncho!

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:26.578
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:31.452
this is your feature presentation,
ten rounds of boxing...

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.331
...introducing from the great city
of Chicago, Husky Miller!

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:46.578
And his opponent from Brazil...

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.775
the South American heavyweight
champion, the sensational...

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:52.930
Kid Poncho!

01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.375
Give him another one, Husky!

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:34.010
Punch him! Punch him!
Punch him on the nose!

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.532
Well, what do you think?

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.850
This is just the beginning.

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.692
A piece of gum, please.

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.570
Hit him with the right! Hit him!

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.849
Yeah! Hit him, Husky!

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.335
...three, four...

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.218
five, six...

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.336
seven, eight...

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.936
nine, ten!

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:30.299
Husky! Husky!

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:39.049
The time: Two minutes,
20 seconds of the second round.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:42.177
The winner,
by a knockout, Husky Miller!

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:49.139
Stand up and fight
until you hear the bell

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:51.290
Stand toe to toe

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.689
Trade blow for blow

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:57.489
Keep punching
till you make your punches tell

01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.732
Show that crowd what you know

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.848
Until you hear that bell,
that final bell

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.976
Stand up and...

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.175
That's our man

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:12.536
The man with the wallop
Hotter than a firecracker

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.850
What a man, man, oh, what a man

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.132
Bell! Bell! Bell!

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.336
Attaboy, can you
make with the wallop

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.536
Win that dough
and then we can doll up

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.850
With a diamond big as a scallop

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.773
Attaboy, attaboy, attaboy!

01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.576
You're comin' with me
or you ain't goin' noplace.

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.775
Let me go!

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.930
You promised you was gonna be mine
till the end.

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.693
That's one promise you're gonna keep.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:41.931
Can't you get it through your head?
We're done. Now let me go!

01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.011
I'd sooner kill you.

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.417
Then here's your chance.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:50.573
But all I wanna do

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.572
Is love you

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.809
Like I used to

01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.017
To hold your hand

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.933
In my hand

01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:07.217
And feel your heart

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.770
Next to my heart

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:16.457
Can't we begin again?

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:24.049
Couldn't we start all over?

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.894
Couldn't we

01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:30.448
Begin again?

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.931
If you want to start a fire
where a fire was before

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.252
The coal you burn must be new coal

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.412
Our flame is out

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.855
Cold as the snow

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:48.338
We had ourselves some fun

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.092
Didn't we?

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.535
And now it's done

01:36:54.780 --> 01:37:00.935
But where can I put my memories?

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:06.174
They got no sea to drown in

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:11.778
The little things
that used to make us laugh

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.296
When we was clownin'

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:21.012
And all the things
we'd say or do

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:27.209
Are all part of me and you

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.336
Joe, you is makin' it tough now

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:32.533
For yourself, the same as for me

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.530
Joe, ain't you heard me
say enough now?

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:37.338
No! No!

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:40.257
No!

01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:43.457
What used to be ain't no more!

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:49.370
Do you forget
how I used to love you?

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:55.057
No-one but Joe
ever loved you so good

01:37:55.140 --> 01:38:00.453
Let's go away
and begin our life all over

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.692
Carmen all alone with Joe

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:11.531
Don't you think
there's a chance?

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.497
Only say that you do

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.377
No! That wouldn't be true

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.578
Ain't gonna lie!

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.979
Ain't gonna lie!

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:29.251
I look at life straight
in the eye?

01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:33.015
I'll have no man laugh at me
while you roll around in his arms.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.136
You're stayin' with me
or I'll kill you.

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:38.257
OK. Kill me now or let me go!

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.650
- For the last time...
- For the last time.

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:45.415
Here's that ten-cent store ring you
gave me. Now that's the end of you!

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.853
You tramp!

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:49.534
You're no good. You never were.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.373
Two-timin' me,
like it don't count for nothin'.

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.178
Well, it does.

01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:58.299
You ain't never gonna do that
to no man again.

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:08.413
Keep punching
till you make your punches tell

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.331
Show that crowd...?

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:21.897
String me high on a tree

01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:27.691
So that soon I will be

01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.739
With my darling

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:36.894
My baby

01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:41.496
My Carmen?

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:20.533
