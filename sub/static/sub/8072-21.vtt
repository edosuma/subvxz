00:08.276 --> 00:09.210
Dinner!

00:09.243 --> 00:11.512
Let's go.
- About time.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.747
I'm wasting away here.

00:13.781 --> 00:14.848
OK, well, come on.

00:14.882 --> 00:15.916
Let's go eat.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.085
We'll see you later, Mom.
- Drive safely.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.619
- See you tomorrow.
- Oh, no, no.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.587
I'm not going.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.721
I'll be fine out here.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.624
Just have some tea
and work on my puzzle.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.261
But, well, you know how
you hate to drive after dark.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.929
Why don't you just take
the puzzle, you know,

00:28.962 --> 00:32.133
and do it in the car
while you're driving home?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.534
Nonsense.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.537
If it gets dark before
I finish the puzzle,

00:36.570 --> 00:37.905
I'll just sleep over.

00:37.938 --> 00:38.806
Let's go, here.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.708
We're looking for corners.

[music playing]

01:32.626 --> 01:35.229
Wow.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.130
Come here.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.030
Come here, look.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.031
What?

01:38.065 --> 01:40.033
This is so creepy.

01:40.067 --> 01:40.968
Doesn't that look like Elvis?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.874
How about a cup
of coffee, Jake?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.576
It's on the house.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.777
I'll take a cream soda.

01:49.810 --> 01:54.315
One cup of coffee, and
I'm up all afternoon.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.617
Hello, girls.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.419
Hi.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.720
So.

01:59.753 --> 02:03.757
Is he going to be our
new dad, or is he just

02:03.791 --> 02:05.226
another one of your nooners?

02:05.259 --> 02:11.199
Don't-- don't start
with me, Roseanne.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.567
That's Jake from the
retirement complex.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.836
My battery was dead,
so he drove me in.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.371
That's all.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.906
Well, she is 63.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.941
I guess it's perfectly
natural that she starts

02:20.974 --> 02:23.644
getting interested in boys.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.678
Roseanne.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.680
You don't think the
two of them are--

02:26.714 --> 02:29.683
oh, gross.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.953
No grosser than her
doing it with Dad.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.323
[both] Eww!

02:35.356 --> 02:37.825
Maybe they're not.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.027
Maybe they should.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.030
Jackie, I think she needs
a new little puzzle pal.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.269
I'll give the bride away if
you kick her down the aisle.

02:52.406 --> 02:55.276
So Ma, is it getting serious?

02:55.309 --> 02:59.547
Has he introduced you
to his parents yet?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.514
Please, girls.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.815
I'm not in the market.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.585
I spent 40 years taking
care of your father,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.887
and I'm not going
to do that again.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.888
Well, relax.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.657
In 40 years, all
that guy's gonna need

03:09.690 --> 03:10.958
is just an occasional mowing.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.164
Come on, Mom.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.432
He's kind of cute.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.700
He's like a big leprechaun.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.305
He's got a cute butt.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.073
Oh, please.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.375
She's right, Mom.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.208
Fine set of cakes.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.713
Well, he uses Speed Walker.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.485
Hi, Jake.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.288
I'm Roseanne, and this
is my sister Jackie.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.556
We're Bev's daughters.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.858
Well, I see where
she gets her looks.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.766
Gee, Jake, could you
get that fork for me?

04:10.418 --> 04:13.287
Get a nice look
at the caboose?

04:13.321 --> 04:15.589
I beg your pardon.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.925
I love to shock your mom.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.729
I had quite enough
shocking on the drive over.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.664
Oh, Beverly.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.099
Don't stop me if you-- if
you heard this one before.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.835
Did you read about the
lady who was so in love

04:27.868 --> 04:30.170
with a priest she followed
him around the church

04:30.203 --> 04:31.305
and grabbed them by the organ?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.647
You put your
teeth in that mouth?

04:39.680 --> 04:44.852
Hey, Ma, I forgot to tell
you, Dan wanted you to come

04:44.885 --> 04:46.487
bowling with us tonight.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.055
I'd love to.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.324
I'm sure I've still got
one of your father's balls

04:50.358 --> 04:51.559
around somewhere.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.663
Alimony wasn't enough?

05:02.202 --> 05:03.637
Hey, Ma.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.839
How about we bring
Jake bowling with us?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.375
I'd love to go bowling.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.777
And Bev, if you want me
to, I'll give you a ride.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.779
I got reclining seats.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.647
I know what you mean by that.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.948
Ah, come on.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.584
You love it.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.386
I can tell you the story
with the milkmaids again.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.286
I'm not listening.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.288
This midget walks into a farm.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.523
- I didn't--
- Strips completely.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.724
Hear a word.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.695
God, Roseanne, they're
feeding off each other.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.440
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.408
Is Darlene around?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.809
I need to get an
assignment from her.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.511
No, she's at the library.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.713
What is DJ doing up?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.315
When I babysit, he's not allowed
to watch American Gladiators.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.419
It makes him want to wrestle.

05:51.452 --> 05:55.088
Gee, one time.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.526
I'll just hang out
until Darlene gets back.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.661
It might be a while.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.595
Oh.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.163
You're working on
your comic book?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.365
Yeah, kind of.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.366
God.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.636
The women you draw
are so beautiful.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.203
I wish I had a body like that.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.105
Yours is fine.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.975
I mean, you know, you're all--

06:15.008 --> 06:16.877
you're in proportion.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.378
Really?

06:18.412 --> 06:19.847
You're just saying that.
- No, no.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.714
I mean it.

06:20.748 --> 06:25.052
Everything ends where it ends.

06:25.085 --> 06:25.886
Thanks.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.427
What are you doing?

06:33.461 --> 06:35.095
I thought you wanted me to.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.631
I mean, the way
you looked at me.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.032
I didn't look at you any way.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.235
I looked at you like this.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.805
There was no way in
how I looked at you.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.508
David, everybody is out.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.144
We can go to your
room if you want.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.546
Molly, what are
you talking about?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.482
You know I'm going
out with Darlene.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.350
David, you're cute
and you're smart,

06:57.384 --> 06:59.152
and you deserve
someone who doesn't

06:59.186 --> 07:00.588
sleep hanging upside down.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.860
Hey, you don't know
anything about Darlene and me.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.061
I know she treats
you like crap.

07:08.095 --> 07:08.962
Come on.

07:08.996 --> 07:09.930
That's not fair.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.533
Darlene treats
everyone like crap.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.734
Come on, David.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.402
She doesn't act like
you're her boyfriend.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
It's hard to tell you
guys are even a couple.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.338
That's not true.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.773
We have big plans.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.775
We're going to this art
school in New York together.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.376
Like you'll still be
together in two years.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.311
No, we're doing it now.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.378
We're dropping
out of high school

07:25.412 --> 07:26.614
as soon as we're accepted.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.015
You're kidding.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.416
You guys are really
going to drop out of--

07:29.449 --> 07:30.317
Hi, David.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.318
Hi, Molly.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.286
DJ, what are you doing up?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.656
Nothing.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.224
I think I got
to go to bed now.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.492
Yeah, I'd better get going.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.294
I can get the homework
assignment from Darlene later.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.496
Dan, did you hear that?

07:42.530 --> 07:46.033
Darlene went to school today.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.401
Well, I must say I had a--

07:48.435 --> 07:49.503
had a great time tonight.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.504
Yeah.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.305
Great time, great
game, but tiring.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.274
Really, really tiring.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.746
That couch looks like
it's got my name on it.

07:58.779 --> 08:02.149
Whoa, I just
can't stop myself.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.417
Whoo!

08:04.451 --> 08:05.318
Oh, Dan.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.354
It's early, now.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.357
And Mom, I think I see
your name on the couch

08:10.390 --> 08:12.159
right here next to Jake.
Come on, Mom.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.060
Sit.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.662
Sit, Mom.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.097
I'm fine standing.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.599
Well, how about a drink?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.033
I'll get her all
liquored up for you.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.873
Don't be ridiculous.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.610
I only have the slightest
nip on special occasions.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.745
Yeah, like every time
we celebrate dinner.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.017
You could talk me into
a cup of coffee, though.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.886
We're out of coffee, Bev.
I think we're out of coffee.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.754
Yeah, we're out
of coffee and tea.

08:40.788 --> 08:41.655
There's no tea.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.790
Come to think of
it, we don't have

08:42.823 --> 08:44.992
anything to eat or
drink in the house,

08:45.025 --> 08:45.959
and we're out of toilet paper.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.296
Hey.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.335
Look, look, look.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.605
A glass of water
will be just fine,

08:57.638 --> 08:59.973
and then maybe you
put a cherry in it.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.742
Oh, that sounds good.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.077
I'll get some for everyone.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.379
Dan, go show Mom where
we keep the cherries.

09:12.686 --> 09:17.324
So, uh, Jake, I think my
mother really likes you.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.827
Every time she really
likes somebody,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.229
she acts real rude and dull.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.235
Well then, I guess your
husband is crazy about me too.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.573
[music playing]

09:40.614 --> 09:42.215
- Darlene?
- Out.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.584
Can I ask you something?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.920
I told you, Deej, you were
placed with this family as part

09:46.954 --> 09:50.223
of a scientific experiment.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.759
Eventually, you'll be
returned to the trees

09:51.792 --> 09:54.962
where you can teach the
others what you've learned.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.197
Are you really gonna leave?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.465
What are you talking about?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.668
I heard David tell Molly
that you're running away.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.973
He told her that?
He's dead.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.975
Man, is he dead.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.878
So are you running away?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.213
No, Deej, I'm
not running away.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.783
But I want you to promise me
you won't tell Mom and Dad

10:15.816 --> 10:16.984
what David said.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.386
Well, if it's not true,
why shouldn't I tell them?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.554
Well, [laughs]
there's a couple

10:21.588 --> 10:24.624
ways we can deal with this.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.226
I could grab you by
the ears and bang

10:26.259 --> 10:29.697
your head against the wall,
which is getting a little old.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.131
Or, for the first
time in your life,

10:31.164 --> 10:33.300
you can act like an
adult, which is not going

10:33.333 --> 10:34.467
to be easy with that haircut.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.842
I won't tell.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.044
Thanks.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.078
Darlene?

10:45.112 --> 10:45.979
What?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.580
Another thing happened.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.481
Like?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.316
They kissed.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.155
They kissed?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.624
- Uh-huh.
- On the lips?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.293
Uh-huh.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.795
Did they do anything else?

11:01.829 --> 11:02.629
What else is there?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.843
David?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.044
Oh, hey.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.046
How was the library?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.714
It was OK.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.149
I was reading this
really stupid thing

11:22.182 --> 11:24.317
about this guy who cheated
on his girlfriend, and--

11:29.289 --> 11:31.524
well, he told a
really big secret.

11:31.558 --> 11:36.596
So one night his girlfriend
snuck up behind him

11:36.629 --> 11:38.665
and stabbed him, like,
500 or 600 times.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.570
You know, 'til her
hand cramped up.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.544
I didn't do anything, Darlene.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.446
She kissed me.
- Oh, please.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.982
I've seen you guys together.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.917
You've been trying to get in
each other's pants for months

11:56.950 --> 11:58.118
now.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.987
I can't believe I trusted
you to keep a secret.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.354
I only told her
about our plans

12:01.388 --> 12:03.356
because she said we weren't
serious about each other.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.657
I was defending us.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.960
Oh, so while you were telling
her how serious we were,

12:06.994 --> 12:08.495
you were chewing the
buttons off her blouse?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.333
This is insane.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.534
You expect me to feel guilty.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.169
I didn't even do anything wrong.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.737
Oh, well, I wouldn't
want you to feel guilty,

12:17.771 --> 12:19.106
so here's good news.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.375
I'm breaking up with you.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.710
So what, that's it?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.245
We're not gonna work
on the comic book?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.014
We're not even going to
hang anymore together?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.048
We're breaking up, David.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.216
It's over.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.818
Gee, can we
still not have sex?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.358
That I'll give you.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.864
[music playing]

13:01.248 --> 13:03.183
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.151
Forks go on the left.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.557
Trouble in teen town?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.096
It's nothing.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.199
David, you better tell us
what you're fighting about.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.301
Yeah, 'cause it's no fun
'til we can take sides.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.306
It's kind of a long story.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.642
Basically before I could
stop her, Molly kissed me.

13:29.676 --> 13:33.413
[dan whistling]

13:33.446 --> 13:36.049
Oh, David, I'm so
sorry that your last meal

13:36.083 --> 13:36.884
is going to be meatloaf.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.190
I didn't kiss her back,
but Darlene broke up with me

13:43.223 --> 13:44.491
anyway.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.227
I was completely right, and
she was completely wrong.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.663
Well, David, it really doesn't
matter who's completely right

13:50.697 --> 13:52.565
and who's completely wrong.

13:52.599 --> 13:58.138
See, it's your job as the
man to apologize to her.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.339
But it's not my fault.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.173
It doesn't matter.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.484
So what does she do?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.853
Well, she gets to forgive you.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.455
But she's the one who's wrong.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.323
Doesn't matter.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.396
All right, fine.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.966
I'll just go up there and
apologize my guts out.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.201
Take all the blame and
pretend that I'm wrong.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.669
At least I'll know I'm right.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.671
[cups clacking]

14:31.704 --> 14:35.175
(WHISPERING) Doesn't matter.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.610
[music playing]

14:41.214 --> 14:44.284
Don't stop me, folks,
if you heard this one.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.352
Knock, knock.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.220
Jake, what do
you want to drink?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.288
Knock, knock.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.623
[clearing throat]
We got cola or juice.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.393
Roseanne, knock, knock.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.863
Dan, someone's at
the door for you!

14:56.896 --> 14:57.965
Little busy here, honey.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.599
DJ, would you go see
who's at the door?

14:59.632 --> 15:00.433
Got it.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.041
And he's the one
we're most proud of.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.343
Hey, I said I was sorry.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.712
Apologies don't count
when Mom made you do it.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.514
All right, fine,
then, I'm not sorry.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
You can go to hell.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.151
Look, Dan, my advice worked.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.919
They're talking again.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.190
There's no one at the door.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.059
What are-- what are
you guys mad about?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.094
I don't want to talk about it.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.761
No, I'd like to talk about it.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.230
Boy, this brings
back great memories.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.233
My sister and I used to
fight like this all the time.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.334
So come on.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.536
What's your--
what's your problem?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.005
I apologized.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.141
I thought we had made up, and
she wouldn't even kiss me.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.475
Well, none of this
would have happened

15:42.509 --> 15:45.145
if he hadn't cheated on me.

15:45.178 --> 15:49.116
My sister and I
were never that close.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.483
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
Jake, David's not
one of our kids.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.553
He's Darlene's boyfriend.
- Oh.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.487
Not boyfriend.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.688
Ex-boyfriend.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
I'm trapped in this house
with my ex-boyfriend.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.858
Well, you should have
thought of that before you

15:58.891 --> 16:00.327
asked him to move in here.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.294
I'm only 16.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.496
Why were you listening to me?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.697
Don't get mad at him.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.366
This is all your fault, Darlene.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.434
You're right.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.702
It is my fault, and
I'm going to fix it.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.304
I want him out of here now.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.439
David, get out.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.773
Sit down, David.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.742
If anybody gets to move out
of this house, it'll be me.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.714
[knocking at door]

16:21.748 --> 16:23.183
Can I come in?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.251
No, but you will.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.569
Well, David told me
about what happened

16:42.602 --> 16:46.139
with Molly and everything.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.476
And you know, Molly is really
different than you, Darlene.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.578
She's very forward.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.047
[clears throat] But I do
believe what David said.

16:54.081 --> 16:59.219
And I also know
why you're upset.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.054
I'm not upset.
I'm not mad.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.057
I'm not anything.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.692
Yeah, well, I think you are.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.227
But you know, you
always cover up

17:07.260 --> 17:09.929
all your feelings with
some really lame jokes

17:09.962 --> 17:13.032
and some big, tough attitude.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.703
Wonder where the
hell you got that?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.004
Please don't tell
me I'm like you.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.807
I'm depressed enough.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.443
I mean, you know, if you're
thinking of shutting down

17:23.476 --> 17:25.845
to keep all the bad stuff
out, you've got to remember,

17:25.878 --> 17:31.151
Darlene, you're not letting
any good stuff in, either.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.051
OK, fine.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.821
You want me to feel something?

17:34.854 --> 17:35.722
All right.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.857
I'm really mad at myself.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.726
I mean, I told him I loved him.
What was I thinking?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.297
Well, I think
you were just being

17:44.331 --> 17:45.965
honest about your
feelings, you know.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.335
And I know how tough
that is for you, Darlene.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.471
But you know, you
really do love David.

17:51.504 --> 17:55.608
And you know that he's
totally crazy about you.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.546
Well, big, fat gold star.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.881
Well, there's just no
way to avoid it, Darlene.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.284
Sometimes you're going to
have to go against everything

18:04.317 --> 18:07.154
I ever taught you and
learn to trust someone.

18:07.187 --> 18:07.987
Even men.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.592
And David trusts you, Darlene.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.329
And I think you ought to give
him the benefit of the doubt.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.065
I just don't think one
person is worth this much.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.537
Well, I do.
I think you're worth this much.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.706
And I think David's is
worth this much, too.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.241
You know, I really,
really like David.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.944
I think he's really
good for you.

18:31.978 --> 18:36.483
You know, he brings
out the human in ya.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.388
You say that like
it's a good thing.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.060
Oh, this sucks.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.802
I love you, Darlene.

18:59.706 --> 19:04.211
I love you best when
you let me be your mom.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.179
[knocking on door]

19:06.213 --> 19:09.148
Hey.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.750
Can he come in?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.118
I don't care.

19:12.151 --> 19:12.952
Come on in.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.893
Well, I would love to stay
and help you some more,

19:20.927 --> 19:24.497
but I feel I should share
my wisdom with others.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.605
I want to take my
stuff back to my room.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.341
Fine.
Take whatever you want.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.626
What are you doing?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.428
Nothing.
You can go now.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.032
Are you crying?

20:00.066 --> 20:01.033
I didn't know you could do that.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.474
What do you think I am, some
sort of freak or something?

20:07.507 --> 20:10.209
I mean, we're breaking
up here, David.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.778
Yeah, but you
broke up with me.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.745
You should be happy.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.781
I should be upset.

20:14.814 --> 20:15.748
Well, sorry.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.083
I'll try and get
it right next time.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.123
David, I don't want
to break up with you.

20:24.156 --> 20:24.957
What?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.896
You don't?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.864
This is so weird.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.133
I'm not used to caring
this much about one person.

20:37.304 --> 20:43.876
Darlene, I've never
seen you like this before.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.213
I like it.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.582
Yeah, well, it's the new me.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.318
I'm going to start
painting sad clowns

20:51.351 --> 20:53.386
and writing little
poems to my cat.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.327
[music playing]

21:23.249 --> 21:26.719
[woman giggling]

21:26.753 --> 21:29.556
OK, kids, enough making up.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.390
Ah!

21:33.192 --> 21:35.828
[music playing]
