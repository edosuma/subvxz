00:02.160 --> 00:04.920
Are you actually happy with
how your life turned out?

00:05.520 --> 00:08.019
I guess this is not what we had
in mind when we were younger,

00:08.020 --> 00:10.520
but... who gets everything
they fantasize about, right?

00:12.240 --> 00:13.880
What do you know about Rekall?

00:14.880 --> 00:17.080
Stay away from them. Do not
mess with your mind, man!

00:17.120 --> 00:19.420
It seems you might be looking
for something. Is is this?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.120
You're gonna wish you had three hands.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.720
I'm looking for Rekall.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.120
Remember to have a good time.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.520
Tell us your fantasy, we'll
give you the memory.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.680
What is it, what's wrong?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.720
Federal Police!

00:36.120 --> 00:37.760
It's all a mistake. Nobody.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
Oh my God.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.040
- I went to Rekall after work.
- What?

00:49.120 --> 00:50.040
And I killed them.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.420
Whatever happened, we're gonna
get through it. It's OK.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.120
IMAGES OF SUSPECT

00:55.120 --> 00:57.120
I can't breathe. Come on.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
You're crazy!

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
- What are you doing?
- My job.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.720
- Our marriage.
- What can I say? I give good wife.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.120
It's gonna be hard for you to believe.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.120
Whenever you think, you
remember it's not real.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.560
The person you think you are.
That's all a lie.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.039
Then if I'm not me, who the hell am I?

01:33.040 --> 01:33.920
THIS SUMMER

01:35.120 --> 01:37.720
Get in. They're looking for you everywhere.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.720
- This is my wife.
- You're married?

01:41.160 --> 01:43.720
- Well, I just have to say we're separated.
- Well, you drive.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
WHAT IS REAL

01:49.160 --> 01:50.160
Doug.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.460
You're not really here. You're still
back at Rekall, strapped to a chair.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.760
- He is lying.
- Shoot her.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.360
- This is not a delusion!
- Kill her, damn it. Shoot!

01:59.160 --> 01:59.760
WHAT IS RECALL

02:02.120 --> 02:03.760
How did he get activated?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.760
I want him alive.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.759
Tell me what's going on.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.120
Just trying to recover what's in your head.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.560
You're gonna need your seat belt on!
