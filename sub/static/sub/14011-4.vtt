WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:07.072
<i> by two separate,</i>
<i> yet equally important groups.</i>

00:07.074 --> 00:09.174
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:09.175 --> 00:11.275
<i> and the district attorneys</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.278 --> 00:13.012
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:22.554
She says she wants
to stop sucking her thumb

00:22.556 --> 00:24.556
before she turns six
in two weeks.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.492
So I say I think that's
a really good idea,

00:26.494 --> 00:28.293
if she really,
really wants to.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.497
So she gets
real serious on me.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.499
She says, "I really, really
want to, Daddy,

00:33.501 --> 00:36.268
but my thumb
just wants to get sucked."

00:36.270 --> 00:38.303
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:41.275 --> 00:43.609
Yeah, here's one
I can settle with.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.244
Oh, yeah.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.280
Just as easy to marry up
as it is down, huh?

01:08.636 --> 01:10.602
Paige?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.606
You awake?

01:22.149 --> 01:23.615
Paige?

01:33.561 --> 01:35.227
Paige?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.283
(<i> horrified gasping</i> )

03:01.749 --> 03:06.185
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

03:39.587 --> 03:41.587
You know, with her hair
pulled back like that,

03:41.589 --> 03:43.222
she's not a bad-
looking lady.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.523
Hey, Doc, the girl's
got a crushed larynx.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.491
Can we get on with it?

03:46.493 --> 03:48.043
Is she going to live?

03:48.044 --> 03:49.594
I've got a trach tube in her
but, uh...

03:49.597 --> 03:51.530
I don't like the shock.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.599
We're waiting for an O.R.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.802
Paige Bartlett, 24.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.537
She a hooker?

03:58.539 --> 03:59.638
No. Eastside kid.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.306
Called in by her roommate.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.308
Came home from a party
and found her.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.577
Address is on the back side
of that top sheet there.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.546
Brownstone apartment.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.281
Front door locked.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.418
Windows and bedroom open
to fire escape-- no bars.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.555
Anybody could have
climbed in.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.023
Rape?

04:18.025 --> 04:21.426
Well, the kit's on the way,
but if it wasn't,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.596
whoever she was with
has one hell of a way

04:24.598 --> 04:26.665
of showing affection.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.542
So, Libby, did Paige
have a job?

04:37.544 --> 04:38.510
Real estate.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.045
What's the name
of the agency?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.546
Worthington and Corey.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.382
It's on Madison Avenue.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.417
You think
she brought someone home?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.552
When Paige goes to bed alone--

04:47.554 --> 04:48.787
like, to sleep--

04:48.789 --> 04:52.658
she always wears
these ratty flannel pajamas.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.026
Last night?

04:54.028 --> 04:56.595
She wasn't
wearing them.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.697
She bring guys home often?

04:58.699 --> 05:01.300
I've only been here
a few months

05:01.302 --> 05:05.537
but she didn't sleep around,
if that's what you're asking.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.306
She's not like that.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.874
She wants to get married.

05:08.876 --> 05:12.577
All I'm asking
is how much interviewing she did

05:12.579 --> 05:13.545
for Mr. Right.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.881
Do you know any of their names?

05:15.883 --> 05:18.517
We weren't here
at the same time that much.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.352
She have any other roommates?

05:20.354 --> 05:23.322
One, but she got married.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.457
Does this person have a name?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.693
Polly Norris.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.630
Paige belong to a gym?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.098
Two of them.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.668
She said it helped
work out her frustrations.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.604
24 years old.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.023
Doesn't sound
like she spent

05:41.024 --> 05:42.441
many nights wearing those
old flannel pajamas.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.109
What, she's 24, what's
she supposed to do?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.110
Act like a nun?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.578
Mike, kids today...

05:46.580 --> 05:48.580
They do drugs, sex is
like a drink of water.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.649
No wonder
they get in trouble.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.517
Oh, wow, and I thought
my old man

05:52.519 --> 05:53.618
was a pain in the ass.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.854
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.690
Where we going: gyms or
married roommates?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.826
Whichever's closer.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.664
Repetition gives you tone;
weight gives you bulk.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.665
I go for tone.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.667
What about Paige Bartlett?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.569
She went
for tone too.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.670
Seen her recently?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.672
Mm-mm.
Not this week.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.673
Hey.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.109
Help me with this,
would you?

06:17.111 --> 06:20.645
Grab my forearms
while I let them back.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.823
Three? Four?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.158
Max, please.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.593
Come on, how many?

06:34.595 --> 06:35.627
Knock it off.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.596
She was interested.
She was...

06:37.597 --> 06:39.564
Look, how many times
would you go out with her

06:39.566 --> 06:41.400
before you went
to bed with her?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.637
Once.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.975
Hey, what do you want,
a bedtime story?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.144
I'd wait until
the honeymoon?

06:52.146 --> 06:54.646
Did you ever hear about a new
disease they got, called AIDS?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.782
Did you ever hear of a new
invention called condoms?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.851
You really need to get
your circuits examined.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.986
I'm hot-wired.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.188
I'm going
to live forever.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.992
Is she going to be okay?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.593
It's touch-and-go.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.728
It's unbelievable.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.997
Why is it always
the special ones?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.465
Special?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.467
Nice,
clean-living.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.003
Do you know what she did
on Saturdays?

07:18.005 --> 07:20.605
Pediatric volunteer
at New York hospital.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.608
She was the daughter
my mother always wanted.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.710
What do you know
about her personal life?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.979
Well, she seemed really
depressed for a while.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.616
She broke up with her boyfriend
about four months ago.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.618
She thought they were
gonna get married.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.619
Lately?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.488
She seemed really happy.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.856
She'd met someone new.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.990
Know his name?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.725
No, I don't, uh...
but there's this friend

07:40.727 --> 07:42.694
that she used
to work out with.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.598
That would be, uh,
Polly Norris?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.767
Yeah. Talk to her.

07:48.769 --> 07:52.037
If you grew up where we did...

07:52.039 --> 07:55.507
ever heard
of Waverly, Pennsylvania?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.642
It's the Greenwich
of Scranton.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.245
We met the first day
of kindergarten.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.680
Grew up together.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.816
Roomed together at Emma Willard
and Vassar.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.787
It's a good life,
but it can be a straitjacket.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.789
With a mink lining.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.791
If you've only worn mink,

08:12.793 --> 08:14.693
you want to know

08:14.695 --> 08:16.795
what denim
feels like.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.630
Well, you sure didn't
marry denim.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.732
I grew up.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.601
My husband's a banker.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.637
Williston, Williams,
MBA from Wharton.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.005
He's a great guy.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.641
All our friends know each other.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.876
It's very comfortable.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.645
It's just what Paige
thought she had

08:33.647 --> 08:35.046
with her old boyfriend.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.049
We heard she met somebody new.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.819
Denim.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.921
Was it serious?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.022
I never met him,

08:44.024 --> 08:46.625
but Paige
talked about him a lot.

08:46.627 --> 08:51.963
You got, uh...
this "denim's" name?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.634
Sorry.

08:55.636 --> 09:00.705
She and denim
hang out anywhere special?

09:00.707 --> 09:04.009
Coopers, B.Z., Le Bar.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.811
She said he liked the hot spots.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.617
GREELEY:
<i> High-priced bankers.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:15.620
So how do they drink
all night

09:15.622 --> 09:17.322
and then go to work
in the morning?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.058
Who says you've got to be
sober to steal money?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.661
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.697
I guess I don't
offer you guys a drink.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.898
You know this girl?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.000
Whoa.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.336
What kind of party
was she at last night?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.038
What kind of party
did you have here?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.873
Hey, guys, I saw her,

09:34.875 --> 09:37.876
but it was before
the prizefight.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.612
She had lillet on the rocks.

09:40.614 --> 09:44.015
Couple of them, with lemon,
about 9:00, 9:30.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.584
He had beer.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.651
Who's he?

09:46.653 --> 09:47.752
Ponytail.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.887
Down to his shoulders.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.322
You know the kind?

09:50.324 --> 09:52.324
to swim upstream?
Always got

09:52.326 --> 09:54.659
Ponytail and the girl
in the photograph,

09:54.661 --> 09:55.760
they meet here?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.095
Nah. No way.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.630
They had an argument.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.031
Wasn't their first.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.766
She wanted him to leave.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.335
He didn't want to go.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.036
She cried; he got P.O.'d.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.339
She pouted two, three minutes.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.774
Then she stuck her tongue
in his ear,

10:09.776 --> 10:12.777
he put his arm around her,
and they left.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.379
You guys excuse me for a second?

10:16.049 --> 10:17.916
There's a lesson in this.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.652
Don't argue in front
of bartenders.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.721
They listen.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.794
That kind of thing

10:29.796 --> 10:33.064
doesn't usually happen
to our kind of people.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.666
Your kind of people?

10:34.668 --> 10:37.936
Well, how romantic
is their evening going to be

10:37.938 --> 10:39.938
if we waltz
through this bar

10:39.940 --> 10:44.209
asking them if they've seen
the girl in this picture?

10:44.211 --> 10:48.813
I believe that she was
in last night around 1:00.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.949
With a guy
wearing a ponytail?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.751
No, alone.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.420
Anyone buy her a drink?

10:55.422 --> 10:56.755
One gentleman.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.189
I didn't recognize him.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.792
Was he your kind
of people?

11:00.794 --> 11:03.695
Cashmere blazer?
Hermes tie?

11:03.697 --> 11:05.063
My kind of people.

11:05.065 --> 11:09.067
And way up there
in the looks department.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.770
A young Warren Beatty.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.074
Are we
your kind of people?

11:16.076 --> 11:19.077
You make it in the
looks department.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.714
The wardrobe needs
a lot of help, though.

11:22.716 --> 11:27.819
Okay. Ponytail dumps her,
so she picks up Warren Beatty.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.087
Yeah.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.022
Let's drop by
the hospital,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.458
see if she's
out of the woods.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.729
Paige Bartlett?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.965
Bed three.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.200
If she can't talk,
maybe she can write.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.170
Excuse me.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.774
Bleeding
in the brain.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.743
We couldn't stop it.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.944
She's gone.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.219
Paige ever talk
about her boyfriend?

12:03.924 --> 12:07.092
We knew Ned,
but that ended a while ago.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.227
Since then,

12:09.229 --> 12:11.262
we didn't pry.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.234
Were there ever any...

12:16.236 --> 12:18.770
indications of other types

12:18.772 --> 12:21.306
she might have
been involved with?

12:21.308 --> 12:25.076
What do you mean "indications"?

12:25.078 --> 12:29.247
Were you ever suspicious
of maybe an involvement

12:29.249 --> 12:32.250
she didn't
want you to know about?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.853
She did not
bring this on herself.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.823
We're not suggesting
that, Mr. Bartlett.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.792
It's just, sometimes, the
smallest piece of information

12:40.794 --> 12:42.861
can occasionally
grow into a lead.

12:42.863 --> 12:49.801
No one who knew Paige
would be capable of hurting her.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.774
LOGAN:
Libby?

12:55.776 --> 12:58.209
I need to know
about the two men.

12:58.211 --> 13:02.180
Ponytail, or the one
who looked like a movie star.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.816
The one with the ponytail's
name is Steve.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.818
Paige was nuts
about him.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.286
What about
Mr. Gorgeous?

13:08.288 --> 13:12.190
The only guy
I ever saw her with was Steve.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.225
Well, does Steve
have a last name?

13:14.227 --> 13:18.129
Paige had one of his magazines.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.169
Ah.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.104
There it is.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.908
He's creative.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.376
Well, there's no name.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.111
There's just an address.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.080
Personal credit for work
is bourgeois.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.183
What?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.185
Steve said that.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.054
You should have
told us about him.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.022
What is this?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.423
It's called<i> Cyberfunk.</i>

13:45.425 --> 13:47.225
I can read.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.260
Makes<i> Heavy Metal</i> look like
<i> Alice In Wonderland.</i>

13:49.262 --> 13:50.895
It's cartoons.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.163
You think this is funny?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.098
Hey, would you stop
taking it so seriously?!

13:54.100 --> 13:56.434
The kids who read this
take this seriously.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.102
It messes up
their heads.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.271
Yeah, that's what
my second-grade teacher

14:00.273 --> 14:02.006
said about
the Beatles.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.908
The Beatles
were great.

14:03.910 --> 14:04.943
This is garbage.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.010
(<i> knock at door</i> )

14:07.480 --> 14:09.848
Who buzzed you in?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.449
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.951
You Steve Feinstein?

14:12.953 --> 14:13.985
WOMAN:
Steve?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.854
I'm kind of busy
right now.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.858
WOMAN:
You keep me waiting
and I won't be interested.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.093
It will just
have to wait.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.497
WOMAN:
Steve?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.933
Oh. A foursome?

14:28.935 --> 14:30.201
They're cops.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.371
So much the better.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.106
So?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.908
What?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.246
I forgot to file
a mailing permit?

14:41.248 --> 14:42.447
Paige Bartlett.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.315
You get arrested
these days

14:44.317 --> 14:46.484
for breaking up
with emotional cripples?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.386
When did you break up with her?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.387
Sunday night.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.889
Did you have an argument?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.190
What's this about?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.325
Somebody
beat her up...

14:54.327 --> 14:55.326
Steve.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.928
I didn't
touch her.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.930
You know what she is?

14:58.932 --> 15:00.465
An uptight WASP.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.001
I was trying
to help her loosen up.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.136
You loosen her up
on Sunday night?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.555
We go out for a drink.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.973
She knows I have an important
dinner-- my biggest backer,

15:09.976 --> 15:12.477
and she wants to come back
here and jump my bones.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.145
I didn't want
to see her anymore.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.147
I told her from the
start: no commitments.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.017
All of a sudden,
she's talking marriage.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.954
Paige Bartlett's dead.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.357
What?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.326
When?

15:28.328 --> 15:32.463
Tell us some more
about Sunday night.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.465
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down a moment.

15:34.467 --> 15:38.336
I left her and went to dinner
at Eleanor Phipps,

15:38.338 --> 15:40.305
as in the Phipps Building.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.975
As in they sell all the plumbing
supplies in the world.

15:43.977 --> 15:47.378
You'd better hope
her story matches yours.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.451
WOMAN:
Henry Luce wanted
to change the way

15:53.453 --> 15:55.186
people looked at sports.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.055
For years, he lost
money doing it.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.990
Your comic book lose money?

15:58.992 --> 16:01.159
Steve and I
want to change

16:01.161 --> 16:03.027
the way people
look at the future.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.529
Sunday night.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.531
Six investors--
friends.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.567
Drinks, 9:30;
Dinner, 11:00.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.536
These investors--
friends--

16:11.538 --> 16:15.073
would you mind
giving us their names?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.018
Steve dazzled them.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.454
My friends don't
dazzle easily.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.592
Did Mr. Feinstein
stay here all night?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.160
Mm-hmm.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.997
Till 3:00 in the morning?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.031
No.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.433
Until 3:30, actually.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.010
My wife's sister?
Smart, good-looking.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.277
All she can talk about

16:53.279 --> 16:55.380
is how she can't
find a man.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.647
This one found two.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.116
Two?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.118
Miss Bartlett had
sexual intercourse

17:00.120 --> 17:01.552
with two different men.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.620
We talking
the same night?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.089
That's what
the DNA says.

17:05.091 --> 17:07.358
And DNA, unlike
the morning news,

17:07.360 --> 17:08.626
doesn't lie.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.363
Ponytail.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.033
Again?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.534
Mm-hmm.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.136
Hey, I thought

17:18.138 --> 17:20.405
you guys would
never come back.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.173
You left Paige Bartlett

17:22.175 --> 17:24.409
and then went to dinner?
on the sidewalk

17:24.411 --> 17:25.410
You got it.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.611
And you never wanted
LOGAN:

17:26.613 --> 17:28.312
to see her again?
And you told her?

17:28.314 --> 17:29.514
And you didn't
sleep with her?

17:29.516 --> 17:31.682
I just did it
to shut her up.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.518
Why didn't you tell us?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.685
Just to shut us up.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.421
What are you guys,
the sex police?

17:36.423 --> 17:38.189
I told you where I was.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.323
Are you gonna arrest him?

17:39.325 --> 17:41.325
Seven people.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.326
Because if you're not,
let us get back to our lives.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.496
You call this a life?

17:45.498 --> 17:48.699
LOGAN:
You don't know
much about women, do you?

17:48.701 --> 17:51.469
Excuse me, Mr. Casanova?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.371
She gets dumped by ponytail.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.540
Where does she go
to feel wanted?

17:55.542 --> 17:58.176
Back to her own kind.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.446
Let's go pay a visit
to Warren Beatty.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.549
POLLY:
Does that look like
Warren Beatty?

18:04.551 --> 18:05.616
20 years younger.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.251
Beatty's better looking.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.586
Ned Loomis.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.354
All-American boy.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.591
Exeter, Princeton,
Harvard Business School.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.327
He dated Paige
up until this Spring.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.196
Her parents loved him.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.697
Did she love him?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.599
She didn't love him.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.367
She worshipped him.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.636
They were
sort of engaged.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.205
What happened?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.574
Ned comes
from one of those families.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.709
Great Grandpa
started a widget company.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.145
Made enough money
to last forever--

18:34.147 --> 18:35.713
except for one thing.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.616
Someone spent all the dough.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.420
Ned got left with
a great name, no money.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.588
So?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.257
He couldn't afford
to get married?

18:46.259 --> 18:48.226
He met
Rebecca Byrne.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.161
Her father's
Seaforth Byrne?

18:50.163 --> 18:53.531
Owns half of Manhattan,
the Staten Island, the Bronx.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.666
So he dumped Paige for Rebecca.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.236
How did she take it?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.239
Like she had
a safe dropped on her.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.308
You don't like Ned too much,
do you?

19:04.310 --> 19:08.179
Ned is a very angry guy.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.615
MAITRE D':
His hair's shorter.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.617
A little less mousse.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.253
He was with
Paige Bartlett?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.522
That is definitely
your man.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.723
Lunch meat.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.359
Oh, he made a big
impression on you.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.527
He swaggers in,

19:22.529 --> 19:24.695
doesn't wait to be
shown to a table,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.764
picks up the phone,
uses it.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.633
Had a creepy
little smile.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.485
Her?

19:30.486 --> 19:32.336
Yeah, they were together
here on Sunday night.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.671
Can you tell us
what time?

19:33.673 --> 19:34.772
They didn't like the
chicken florentine,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.207
said the spinach
wasn't cooked

19:36.209 --> 19:37.508
and the muscadet
wasn't cold enough.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.677
It was 1:00 in the morning,
and guess what,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.513
it was a lousy tip--
what's the problem?

19:43.716 --> 19:46.350
The girl's dead.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.287
I'm not surprised.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.189
Ten to one, he did it.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.691
Off-track betting
doesn't make arrests.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.426
How are the witnesses?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.428
It's the victim
who's trouble.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.496
The girl's attitude.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.264
If she was
sleeping around...

20:00.266 --> 20:01.666
Come on, Max,
it wasn't like that.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.268
You saying she didn't
do two guys that night?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.237
The point is:
one of them's got an alibi.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.338
All right, all right.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.706
You have an address
for this Loomis?

20:08.708 --> 20:12.243
See if you can get him
to come in and talk.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.312
I wouldn't make
book on that.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.581
If he'll come in
without the collar, fine.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.584
If not, also fine, okay?

20:19.586 --> 20:22.220
Fine.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.654
Fine.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.241
GREEVEY:
<i> We're investigating</i>

20:27.242 --> 20:28.858
<i> Paige Bartlett's murder,</i>
<i> Mr. Loomis.</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:30.561
Oh, God.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.729
Terrible.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.732
I actually saw her
the night she died.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.736
Look, could we schedule this
for, say, tomorrow?

20:38.738 --> 20:41.706
These people are very close
to an offer.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.641
Look, any help
you can give us...

20:43.643 --> 20:46.477
the appliances, right?
You're leaving

20:46.479 --> 20:47.478
Yes, everything.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.480
That includes
the Wolf range

20:49.482 --> 20:50.581
and the Sub-Zero.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.616
The furniture?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.417
You can move
right in.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.685
Excuse me, what
agency are you with?

20:54.687 --> 20:55.686
Homicide.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.754
Oh.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.422
Is something wrong?

20:58.424 --> 21:01.325
A friend of Mr. Loomis's
has been murdered.

21:01.327 --> 21:04.428
Do you think
this will affect the price?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.698
Why don't we go look
at the dining room area?

21:09.636 --> 21:12.120
You hear that?

21:12.121 --> 21:14.605
Do you have any idea
how soft the co-op market is?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.874
I'm very sorry,
but we'd really like you

21:16.876 --> 21:19.644
to come down to the precinct
for an interview.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.612
Am I under arrest?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.747
No, no.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.748
Why?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.816
Do you expect to be arrested?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.755
Why don't I just
give my lawyer a call

21:30.757 --> 21:32.757
before we leave.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.960
Polly Norris,
your old friend,

21:35.962 --> 21:38.529
thought that you might
be able to help.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.798
Polly... I heard
she got married.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.769
Oh, forgot
to send a present.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.806
I've tried to help you.
Look,

21:48.808 --> 21:50.808
to help at all.
You haven't tried

21:50.810 --> 21:52.410
everything I know.
I've told you

21:52.412 --> 21:55.546
I'm not, am I?
Now if I'm not under arrest--

21:55.548 --> 21:57.415
I'd like to go home.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.418
What's going on here?

22:00.420 --> 22:01.952
Who's the ADA
in charge?

22:01.954 --> 22:03.554
Paul Robinette.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.622
Dick Berkley.
How do you do?

22:04.624 --> 22:06.174
My client-- is he in custody?

22:06.175 --> 22:07.725
And if  he's in custody,
have you read him his rights?

22:07.727 --> 22:09.860
If you haven't read him his
rights, I want him out now.

22:09.862 --> 22:13.664
Sergeant Greevey,
read Mr. Loomis his rights.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.799
If he wasn't in custody,

22:14.801 --> 22:16.801
and he didn't feel free
to leave...

22:16.802 --> 22:18.802
Counselor, he accepted
our request for an interview.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.771
Oh, really? Really?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.640
An interview,
as opposed to an interrogation.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.876
That's a very interesting
semantic hair split, Detective.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.745
Mr. Berkley...

22:27.747 --> 22:29.580
Mr. Robinette,

22:29.582 --> 22:30.915
you look like a nice fellow.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.550
I'm a nice fellow;
we're all nice fellows,

22:32.552 --> 22:34.202
but you know and I know

22:34.203 --> 22:35.853
that this case has been
mishandled since hour one.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.022
What are you trying to do,
set up an appeal right here?

22:38.024 --> 22:41.892
That's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.061
LOOMIS:
Damn it!

22:44.063 --> 22:45.796
That little bitch!

22:45.798 --> 22:48.799
Why couldn't she just
leave me the hell alone?

22:48.801 --> 22:49.900
(<i> banging</i> )

22:49.902 --> 22:50.901
Damn it!

22:50.903 --> 22:52.737
All right, all right,
come on.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.772
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

22:54.774 --> 22:58.743
I can't believe
this is happening to<i> me!</i>

23:01.881 --> 23:04.648
STONE:
Paul, I want a yes
or a no answer.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.484
Did Loomis think
he was in custody

23:06.486 --> 23:08.169
before they
mirandized him?

23:08.170 --> 23:09.853
I was there maybe two minutes
before Berkley showed up.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.589
We could have
a serious problem here.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.790
He wasn't in custody.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.525
He came voluntarily.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.893
(<i> whispering</i> ):
When did they
arrest him?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.762
Edward Loomis.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.007
JUDGE:
Mr. Loomis,
the charge against you

23:30.009 --> 23:32.576
is murder
in the second degree.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.778
How do you plead?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.846
The defendant
pleads not guilty.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.815
Your Honor, if it
pleases the court,

23:37.817 --> 23:39.483
Mr. Loomis
is a trustworthy young man

23:39.485 --> 23:40.918
of impeccable reputation.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.754
I could bring you
many character references

23:43.756 --> 23:46.824
and you would find him
to be as fine a citizen as I do.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.627
All of that aside, Mr. Berkley,
he's charged with murder.

23:49.629 --> 23:50.761
Get on with it.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.297
Thank you, Your Honor.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.832
Mr. Loomis has recently
suffered financial reverses

23:55.835 --> 23:57.868
and bail would be
a severe hardship.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.104
We ask that you release him
on his own recognizance.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.505
Your Honor,
hardship or not...

24:01.507 --> 24:02.740
I'm there before you,
Mr. Stone.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.876
Bail is set at $50,000.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.061
How did you hear
about this, Sally?

24:24.063 --> 24:26.764
Oh, I get messages
from a filling

24:26.766 --> 24:28.632
in my back tooth.
How are you, Paul?

24:28.634 --> 24:31.869
These messages tell you
to bring a photographer?

24:31.871 --> 24:34.004
Great story.
Great characters.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.639
Real people.

24:35.641 --> 24:36.974
Sally, you didn't
invent them.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.710
Can I quote you
on that?

24:39.712 --> 24:41.645
Who's the woman?

24:41.647 --> 24:42.880
Ned's fiancée?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.782
Rebecca Byrne.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.917
Sweet, innocent, rich.

24:46.919 --> 24:50.054
Hmm, outside of Cole Porter,
those words go together?

24:50.056 --> 24:52.056
Well, she thinks
he's Mr. Wonderful.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.725
You know what
her friends call her?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.060
The socialite nun.

24:57.697 --> 25:02.099
Princeton, top eating club,
Harvard Business School.

25:02.101 --> 25:05.836
Making $350,000 a year
before he was 28.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.173
Hey, you're not going
after Al Capone here.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.674
Adam, that's ridiculous.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.844
I'm not talking
merits of the case.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.946
Any jury takes
one look at him,

25:15.948 --> 25:17.681
you're already
down for the count.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.949
Until they look
at the evidence.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.918
Maybe they decide
just 'cause you're handsome,

25:20.920 --> 25:22.820
doesn't mean
you get away with murder.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.054
Yeah, what do you
want me to tell you?

25:24.056 --> 25:25.589
Hamburger is filet mignon?

25:25.591 --> 25:28.859
You've got absolutely no
witnesses to anything

25:28.861 --> 25:30.594
after they left the bar,

25:30.596 --> 25:34.832
and you're prosecuting
every mother's dream
for murder.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.936
You're going to need
a hell of a lot more
than moral indignation

25:38.938 --> 25:41.105
to be able to get a
conviction on this kid.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.873
What would you like?

25:42.875 --> 25:43.874
A confession?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.876
That would be nice.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.780
Waitress says
that he was with the victim

25:49.782 --> 25:51.882
at 1:00 in the morning.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.852
Roommate came home at 2:15.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.855
Loomis says he was home alone.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.691
Feinstein?

26:00.693 --> 26:02.860
He's a slime ball,

26:02.862 --> 26:06.931
but he's got an alibi
wrapped in concrete.

26:06.933 --> 26:10.868
It gets better and better.

26:10.870 --> 26:14.138
So, what do we go?
Loomis was with her

26:14.140 --> 26:16.073
an hour before
she was attacked.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.741
They had an argument.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.877
We got a blood sample,
we know he took her to bed.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.145
Not much.

26:21.147 --> 26:24.148
Loomis is never
what he seems.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.750
To the girlfriend,
he's Mr. Wonderful.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.286
To Polly Norris,
he's mean, he's frustrated.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.656
Snooty maitre d' called him
"our kind of people,"

26:32.658 --> 26:35.025
but the waitress, in ten
minutes, she knew he was a jerk.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.795
What did she call him?
"Lunch meat."

26:37.797 --> 26:40.798
He changes identities
like he changes underwear.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.735
Any surprise
one of them is killer?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.770
I don't know. I think
Schiff's right.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.840
Jury looks at him, they see
a tattoo across his forehead:

26:49.842 --> 26:51.842
"Born to win."

26:53.245 --> 26:56.213
The State is asking
for the most extreme invasion

26:56.215 --> 26:57.815
of my client, Your Honor.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.783
If the words "unreasonable
search and seizure"

26:59.785 --> 27:01.018
have any meaning at all.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.686
The motion on the table

27:02.688 --> 27:04.922
is not for open-heart surgery,
Mr. Berkley.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.725
Just a blood sample.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.793
Please permit me to point out
that the State's case

27:09.795 --> 27:10.928
is less than compelling.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.897
I know the precedents.

27:13.899 --> 27:15.065
Mr. Stone?

27:15.067 --> 27:16.767
Your Honor, this
evidence is crucial.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.935
It will, or it won't

27:17.937 --> 27:19.336
establish the
defendant's presence

27:19.338 --> 27:21.071
at the scene
of the crime.

27:21.073 --> 27:24.708
I think the State has
a compelling interest here.

27:24.710 --> 27:27.244
Mr. Loomis will give
a sample of his blood

27:27.246 --> 27:29.013
to the medical examiner.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.915
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.089
Girlfriend's
not here today.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.927
Knock on her door.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.764
When I first met Ned,
six months ago,

27:46.766 --> 27:49.133
he was having
a hard time himself.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.934
I mean, me,
I didn't expect

27:50.936 --> 27:52.936
that my problems
would come first.

27:52.938 --> 27:57.041
My brother was very sick,
almost died,

27:57.043 --> 28:00.878
and Ned flew to Maine
to see him.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.747
Just left the office,
went to the airport

28:03.749 --> 28:06.884
because he knew
it would make me feel better.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.952
Ned was having a hard time?

28:08.954 --> 28:11.889
His brokerage business failed.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.991
But talk to his partner.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.959
Talk to Loren Belknap.

28:15.961 --> 28:20.030
He's a very successful man,
and he just loves Ned.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.966
The night Paige Bartlett
was assaulted,

28:22.968 --> 28:24.334
did you talk to Ned?

28:24.336 --> 28:27.204
I saw him the next day.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.273
He was fine.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.875
Belknap and Loomis,
kings of Wall Street.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.777
Did you ever watch
anybody do Cole calls?

28:33.779 --> 28:35.462
Cold calls?

28:35.463 --> 28:37.146
<i> Cole</i> calls-- reverse
phone directories.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.415
Addresses first,

28:38.417 --> 28:40.017
names and numbers
second.

28:40.019 --> 28:42.052
So you find your best customers.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.887
Ned Loomis was 22, 23.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.157
11 hours straight on the phone,
peddling municipal bonds

28:47.159 --> 28:48.959
when nobody wanted them.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.195
By 9:00 at night,
brokers in business 20 years

28:51.197 --> 28:53.931
would have sold their wives for
the list he built in one day.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.332
But your business went under.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.968
Bad times--
they come, they go.

28:57.970 --> 29:01.271
My house on Nevis,
I'll buy it back someday.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.307
Ned successful
with women?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.843
Swordsman-- he
sits down at a bar,

29:05.845 --> 29:08.045
women line up like
Zabar's Sunday morning.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.313
Even after he was engaged?

29:09.315 --> 29:12.182
A real entrepreneur...
in every field.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.388
The piece of trash.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.090
He's fighting with that girl,

29:20.092 --> 29:21.992
the one who died,
looking real involved.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.328
He was just patting my
butt at the same time.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.464
Well, maybe that just makes him
overenthusiastic.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.466
Last spring,
the blonde at the bar?

29:29.468 --> 29:30.968
He hit on her.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.202
He could have hit
on 100 girls,

29:32.204 --> 29:35.239
and 99 would say yes,
but this one said no.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.307
So he threw a drink
in her face so hard,

29:37.309 --> 29:41.011
the ice cube
bruised her eye.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.346
Excuse me.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.986
Worst thing you can say
is he fools around

29:48.988 --> 29:50.104
and he's got
a temper.

29:50.105 --> 29:51.221
Not a clean
bill of health.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.456
But not the plague.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.925
(<i> phone rings</i> )

29:54.927 --> 29:56.360
Stone.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.963
Send it over.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.365
DNA match on Loomis.

30:01.367 --> 30:04.268
He wouldn't admit being there,
but he slept with her.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.970
Run down every address he
ever lived at since puberty.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.972
I want a check on him
from here to Hawaii--

30:08.974 --> 30:10.474
every speeding, every
jaywalking ticket
he's ever gotten...

30:10.475 --> 30:11.975
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir, you
can't go in there!

30:11.977 --> 30:13.911
MAN:
I've got to see him right
this second-- right now!

30:13.913 --> 30:15.078
WOMAN:
Try to calm down!

30:15.080 --> 30:16.947
I can't calm down--
have you seen this?

30:16.949 --> 30:18.248
I've got to see
him right now!

30:18.250 --> 30:19.917
I'm not-- no!

30:19.919 --> 30:22.152
Mr. Bartlett.
Is this the way
you run your office?!

30:22.154 --> 30:23.487
Look what they're doing
to my daughter!

30:23.489 --> 30:25.289
I've seen this and
I'm terribly sorry.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.957
They've interviewed any man
she even winked at.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.642
How do they know
these things?
Sir...

30:28.643 --> 30:30.326
those leaks did not come
from us or from the police.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.062
It's bad enough
losing a child,

30:32.064 --> 30:34.932
but this smut is like
killing her all over again!

30:34.934 --> 30:37.501
I understand, sir.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.002
This Packard article.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.505
What's wrong with her?
She's a pawn, Adam.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.340
The night Loomis was
booked, he called her.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.009
He's feeding her everything
he gets in discovery.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.144
Gets worse.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.379
I have the defense's
witness list.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.449
Your ponytail, the guy with
a perfect alibi, he's on it.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.917
Why isn't he on ours?

30:53.919 --> 30:55.285
He's putting ponytail
on the stand

30:55.287 --> 30:57.154
to turn Paige into a tramp.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.455
I'll call him on direct.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.123
Who the hell's
on trial here?

31:00.125 --> 31:03.427
The victim.
Wonderful.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.263
Thanks.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.031
Ben.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.000
Six years ago, Boston,

31:10.002 --> 31:11.134
while Loomis was at
Harvard Business School.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.536
Charged with assault

31:12.538 --> 31:15.038
and sexual assault
and battery.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.106
A conviction?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.507
Never went to trial.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.309
The charges
were dropped.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.978
Hmm... is she reachable?

31:20.980 --> 31:23.947
Married, still
living in Boston.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.149
Call her, tell her
you have to see her

31:26.151 --> 31:28.585
and that you can
be there by plane

31:31.657 --> 31:33.307
in an hour and a half.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.958
(<i> raspy voice</i> ):
Mr. Robinette,
I told you on the phone

31:34.960 --> 31:36.226
I have nothing to say.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.961
Yes, yes, I know,

31:37.963 --> 31:40.264
but you did file charges
against Mr. Loomis.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.466
The charges were dropped.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.067
It was a mistake.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.602
What was the mistake?

31:45.604 --> 31:49.072
Filing the charges
or dropping them?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.308
I don't want to
talk about it.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.610
Look, I'm sorry you went to
all this trouble to find me.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.612
Ms. Brody...

31:55.614 --> 31:58.081
Mr. Loomis has been charged
with the murder of a woman

31:58.083 --> 31:59.349
he assaulted.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.486
I'm sorry.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.355
I have nothing else to say.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.126
(<i> sighs</i> )

32:09.128 --> 32:11.028
(<i> door closes</i> )

32:12.431 --> 32:15.299
Do you think
I'm stupid?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.601
Away from my apartment,
in neutral territory,

32:17.603 --> 32:21.071
you thought
I'd tell you things.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.406
I'm not an idiot.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.174
I may be young,

32:24.176 --> 32:27.144
but I understand some
things about human nature.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.347
Your fiancé's
human nature.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.383
What do you understand
about that?

32:33.385 --> 32:36.320
You talked to Ned that night

32:36.322 --> 32:40.624
when Paige Bartlett
was attacked.

32:40.626 --> 32:45.462
When anyone ever asks Ned
for anything--<i> anything...</i>

32:47.466 --> 32:50.634
...a favor, a friend,
someone on the street,

32:50.636 --> 32:52.970
he's the most generous person
I know.

32:52.972 --> 32:56.039
The night Paige Bartlett
was attacked.

32:58.010 --> 33:02.412
He came to my apartment
around 2:00.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.449
He was drunk.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.351
Upset.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.452
About what?

33:08.454 --> 33:11.421
His business
going under.

33:11.423 --> 33:15.225
Having to sell his apartment.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.761
He's been dependent
on me for money.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.497
That makes a man unhappy.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.699
How unhappy?

33:28.474 --> 33:30.507
Ben, she knows
he killed her.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.509
You read minds?

33:32.511 --> 33:35.145
If I put her
on the stand?

33:35.147 --> 33:36.446
She'll never say it.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.181
(<i> intercom buzzes</i> )

33:38.183 --> 33:41.151
Yeah?

33:41.152 --> 33:44.120
WOMAN:
Mr. Stone, there's a Mr. and
Mrs. Brody are here to see you.

33:44.123 --> 33:47.024
Send them in.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.267
Mr. Stone,
I'm Alex Brody.

33:57.269 --> 33:58.268
How do you do?

33:58.270 --> 33:59.536
My wife, Elise.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.104
Nice to meet you.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.206
And my associate,
Paul Robinette.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.176
We've decided
that she has to talk to you.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.477
Please, be seated.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.552
A last-minute trip?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.255
Not exactly.

34:21.493 --> 34:25.562
For a long time, I
thought it was my fault.

34:29.468 --> 34:33.770
I met Ned at a
mixer at B school.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.440
I was Simmons,
junior year

34:36.442 --> 34:39.376
and they, uh,

34:39.378 --> 34:43.747
they were Harvard
Business School.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.349
He was very sexy.

34:48.554 --> 34:54.558
He came back
to my apartment, and...

34:54.560 --> 34:57.427
I was very inexperienced.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.598
He wanted...

35:01.600 --> 35:04.501
He's not judging you.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.473
Oral sex.

35:09.475 --> 35:15.545
And he got angry.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.814
He tried to force me.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.518
And he pushed my head,
and he...

35:21.520 --> 35:23.587
He choked her.

35:36.468 --> 35:41.371
I told my parents
it was a car accident.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.441
They still don't know.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.917
I'll testify now.

36:03.195 --> 36:06.563
I can't let you testify.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.498
What?

36:08.500 --> 36:12.435
STONE:
Rules of evidence.

36:12.437 --> 36:17.908
A defendant's previous behavior
cannot be admitted in a trial.

36:17.910 --> 36:22.479
Even if Loomis had been
convicted of assaulting you,

36:22.481 --> 36:25.549
it would be very difficult.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.488
You mean this guy
can go around hurting women,

36:31.490 --> 36:33.623
and they won't listen?

36:36.261 --> 36:38.929
That's the law.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.536
Now, this shouting match between
Mr. Loomis and Miss Bartlett,

36:46.538 --> 36:49.239
You testified that it happened
at 1:00 a.m.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.408
Was there loud music
playing at the time?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.576
Yes, but I
could still...

36:52.578 --> 36:53.643
And were other patrons
shouting

36:53.645 --> 36:55.545
just to heard
over the music?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.546
Yes.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.315
At any time

36:58.317 --> 37:02.452
did you see Mr. Loomis
strike Miss Bartlett?

37:02.454 --> 37:04.521
No.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.224
Did you see him touch her
at any time?

37:07.226 --> 37:09.326
No.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.560
No.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.973
Based upon the results
of those tests,

37:22.975 --> 37:24.641
have you formed an opinion

37:24.643 --> 37:27.677
to a reasonable degree
of scientific accuracy?

37:27.679 --> 37:30.747
Yes. The blood sample
taken from Mr. Loomis

37:30.749 --> 37:33.016
came from the same person

37:33.018 --> 37:35.719
as the semen recovered
from the body of Miss Bartlett.

37:35.721 --> 37:40.624
Can you state the likelihood
of such a test as this

37:40.626 --> 37:43.360
resulting in a false match?

37:43.362 --> 37:45.629
It's virtually
impossible.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.365
Perhaps a few years ago,
I wouldn't be so certain,

37:48.367 --> 37:49.933
but now, I have no doubts.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.702
Nothing further, Your Honor.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.438
"Virtually impossible"
to make a mistake.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.640
Is that what you just stated:

37:56.642 --> 37:59.376
"virtually impossible"
to make a mistake?

37:59.378 --> 38:00.510
That's correct.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.445
Now, don't those
same tests

38:02.447 --> 38:05.415
also indicate Miss Bartlett
had sexual relations

38:05.417 --> 38:08.385
with more than one man
the night she died?

38:08.387 --> 38:10.387
Yes.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.322
How many?

38:12.324 --> 38:14.658
Miss Bartlett
had sexual intercourse

38:14.660 --> 38:16.393
with two men that night.

38:16.395 --> 38:19.529
No further questions.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.540
Now, you testified that you were
at the dinner party

38:30.542 --> 38:32.442
from 9:30 in the evening

38:32.444 --> 38:34.411
till way past 3:00
in the morning.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.679
Is that right?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.414
That's right.
And you never left?

38:37.416 --> 38:39.082
The food was good.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.385
You normally eat dinner
till way past 3:00?

38:42.387 --> 38:44.487
I don't have breakfast
until noon.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.972
(<i> light laughter</i> )

38:45.973 --> 38:47.456
BERKLEY:
Now, the night
that Paige Bartlett

38:47.459 --> 38:49.559
was attacked, you testified

38:49.561 --> 38:51.661
that you had drinks with her
at a club called Coopers.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.363
Now, did you argue
with her there?

38:53.365 --> 38:55.732
Objection. Mr. Feinstein
is not on trial.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.434
JUDGE:
I'll allow it.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.502
Answer the question.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.072
We had an argument.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.541
Was it a serious argument?
Shouting?

39:04.543 --> 39:06.326
Yeah, I shouted a little.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.110
But you didn't
kill her?
No, I didn't.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.580
So we know it's possible
to fight with somebody

39:10.582 --> 39:12.115
and to not kill them.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.850
JUDGE:
Mr. Berkley.

39:13.852 --> 39:17.821
The jury will disregard
that last remark.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.593
Mr. Feinstein, were you
surprised to find out

39:23.595 --> 39:25.695
that Miss Bartlett had had sex
with two men on one night?

39:25.697 --> 39:27.497
Objection--
irrelevant!

39:27.499 --> 39:28.798
Overruled.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.568
Mr. Feinstein's perception
of that night

39:31.570 --> 39:34.137
may be relevant.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.473
I wasn't surprised, no.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.607
When you dating
Miss Bartlett,

39:37.609 --> 39:39.743
how many other men
was she sleeping with?

39:39.745 --> 39:43.613
Objection-- Mr. Loomis
is on trial, not Miss Bartlett.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.699
Sustained.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.784
Mr. Berkley, you will stop
that line of questioning now.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.555
I don't like the idea
any more than you do.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.824
We plead him,
he gets three years.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.127
You don't plea him,
he does no time at all.

39:57.129 --> 39:58.695
He killed Paige Bartlett.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.398
I don't want him walking
into a barroom,

40:01.400 --> 40:03.133
turning on that cheap smile
and his preppy patter,

40:03.135 --> 40:04.567
and taking
another girl home.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.636
I don't want him
on the street ever!
Ben...

40:06.638 --> 40:07.771
Take a plea!

40:07.773 --> 40:09.539
You be the one to
tell the Bartlett's.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.442
Their daughter's life
for three years in jail?

40:12.444 --> 40:14.444
Girlfriend?

40:14.446 --> 40:15.745
If somebody was going
to shoot him,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.781
she'd put her body
in the line of fire.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.649
Get the woman from Boston
on the stand.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.785
Impossible.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.553
It's difficult.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.723
Try.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.175
It's wrong.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.626
If Elise Brody testifies,
you'll hang my client.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.728
There's lots of
precedent here, Judge.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.630
<i> Jones v. State.</i>

40:33.632 --> 40:36.199
<i> United States</i>
<i> v. Beechum.</i>

40:36.201 --> 40:39.769
And the crime bears
Loomis' signature.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.672
What he did to Elise Brody
is precisely what he did

40:42.674 --> 40:43.773
to Paige Bartlett.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.742
Slight problem, Mr. Stone.

40:45.744 --> 40:49.546
He wasn't convicted
of assaulting Miss Brody.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.613
<i> Huddleston v. United States.</i>

40:50.615 --> 40:54.117
According to
Brody's testimony,

40:54.119 --> 40:57.554
the jury can reasonably believe
that he attacked her.

40:57.556 --> 41:03.226
Quote, "We have leaned over
so far backwards

41:03.228 --> 41:05.695
"to protect the rights
of defendants,

41:05.697 --> 41:08.698
"that we are at risk of putting
the justice system

41:08.700 --> 41:11.134
flat on its back."

41:11.136 --> 41:12.702
Who wrote that?

41:12.704 --> 41:14.170
Rehnquist.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.705
Scalia?

41:15.707 --> 41:19.242
I did, last spring.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.944
<i> Iowa Law Review.</i>

41:20.946 --> 41:23.913
And I believe it.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.982
There are killers walking
the streets

41:25.984 --> 41:27.650
who should be in jail

41:27.652 --> 41:28.818
because we keep
excluding evidence

41:28.820 --> 41:30.854
that would put them there.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.722
Your Honor, you can't allow
this woman...

41:32.724 --> 41:35.492
Sit down, Mr. Berkley.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.661
Mr. Stone, no one
will ever accuse me

41:38.663 --> 41:41.598
of setting a murderer free,

41:41.600 --> 41:44.634
but whatever I feel
about defendants' rights,

41:44.636 --> 41:47.871
in this case,
I'm going to turn you down.

41:47.873 --> 41:50.507
The law is shaky
on the subject,

41:50.509 --> 41:55.945
and this woman's testimony
would be grossly prejudicial.

42:04.289 --> 42:06.623
I told you, I have
nothing else to say.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.826
Miss Byrne, I'd like you
to meet Elise Brody.

42:17.769 --> 42:22.038
This is what Ned Loomis
did to me.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.810
Oh...

42:29.548 --> 42:32.682
What time did he get
to your apartment, Miss Byrne?

42:32.684 --> 42:34.751
He woke me.

42:34.753 --> 42:35.919
It was 2:30
in the morning.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.654
And what did he tell you?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.656
He said he had hurt Paige.

42:39.658 --> 42:41.925
He said it was an accident.

42:41.927 --> 42:43.793
It was her fault.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.261
An accident.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.930
Did he tell you
what he meant?

42:46.932 --> 42:49.832
He told me he was drunk.

42:49.834 --> 42:54.037
She wanted him to...

42:54.039 --> 42:57.740
have kinky sex with him.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.644
He said he didn't want
to, he was engaged.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.846
And she dragged him into bed.

43:03.848 --> 43:09.886
And when he fought her off,
he hurt her.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.960
Do you consider Ned Loomis
to be a trustworthy person?

43:16.962 --> 43:18.728
BERKLEY:
Objection!

43:18.730 --> 43:21.097
Irrelevant. Mr. Stone is asking
her whether she believed him.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.865
Overruled.

43:22.867 --> 43:26.836
The witness may answer
the question.

43:26.838 --> 43:29.772
No.

43:31.810 --> 43:35.712
No, I don't find him
to be a trustworthy person.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.914
STONE:
And would you tell
the jury why.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.617
Objection-- Your Honor, now he
wants an opinion on an opinion.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.285
Overruled.

43:42.287 --> 43:43.953
Thank you, Your Honor.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.689
Once again, Miss Byrne,

43:46.691 --> 43:49.025
why do you consider

43:49.027 --> 43:51.828
the man you
are engaged to

43:51.830 --> 43:54.797
to be untrustworthy?

43:59.738 --> 44:05.408
The night that it happened,

44:05.410 --> 44:08.645
Ned told me
that nothing like this

44:08.647 --> 44:10.647
had ever happened to him before.

44:12.717 --> 44:15.151
And I believed him...

44:16.821 --> 44:21.824
until I spoke to a woman

44:21.826 --> 44:24.060
who told me he had choked her.

44:24.062 --> 44:25.928
Objection!
Your Honor, hearsay!

44:25.930 --> 44:27.096
Mr. Stone knows damn well

44:27.098 --> 44:28.831
that you can't allow.
Sustained!

44:28.833 --> 44:30.733
The jury will disregard

44:30.735 --> 44:32.969
that last statement.

44:32.971 --> 44:36.773
And you pull that again in
my courtroom, you'll regret it.

44:53.892 --> 44:55.925
No further questions.

45:00.098 --> 45:03.166
Ben, they're coming in.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.969
Three hours, 12 minutes.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.371
That's way too fast.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.039
We're dead.

45:15.747 --> 45:18.748
Has the jury reached a verdict?

45:18.750 --> 45:20.717
Yes, Your Honor.

45:20.719 --> 45:24.721
Will the defendant please rise.

45:27.826 --> 45:31.828
JUDGE:
As to the sole count
of the indictment,

45:31.830 --> 45:36.733
murder in the second degree,
how do you find?

45:36.735 --> 45:39.736
As to the sole count
of the indictment,

45:39.738 --> 45:42.438
we find the defendant...

45:42.440 --> 45:44.974
guilty.

45:44.976 --> 45:47.243
(<i> light cheering, murmuring</i> )

45:58.757 --> 46:01.791
ROBINETTE:
Feel good?

46:01.793 --> 46:03.960
STONE:
Well, it's just
preventive detention.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.062
Loomis destroyed every
life he ever touched.

46:06.064 --> 46:08.965
We didn't change
that one iota.

46:11.069 --> 46:14.036
At least
we gave them justice.

46:17.142 --> 46:19.008
It's over.

46:21.012 --> 46:21.043
Justice doesn't
give you grandchildren.
