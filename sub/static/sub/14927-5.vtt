10:20.353 --> 10:23.791
LINA, I KNOW.
I'M WORKING ON HIM.
I PROMISE.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.658
MOM.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.926
YEAH, YEAH,
HOLD ON.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.827
Yeah.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.729
AM I A ROBOT?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.866
HENRY, STOP BEING SILLY.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.036
OH, MY GOD.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.772
I A ROBOT.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.741
I DON'T GET IT.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.876
IF THAT ORGAN GRINDER
WAS AFTER LILY,

10:42.910 --> 10:44.912
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
GET RID OF HIM?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.947
DAD, DAD,
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.715
YOU NEVER HAD DAUGHTERS.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.449
SEE, IF SHE WOULD
HAVE FIGURED OUT

10:49.482 --> 10:51.284
THAT I WAS TRYING
TO PUSH THEM APART,

10:51.318 --> 10:54.287
IT WOULD ONLY
DRIVE THEM TOGETHER.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.890
UH-HUH. YES.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.391
YES, HE'S HERE.
HOLD ON.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.893
SEAN, IT'S LINA.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:59.927 --> 11:00.894
I THINK YOU SHOULD
EXPLAIN TO HER

11:00.928 --> 11:01.895
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE DOING.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.831
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HER.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.798
TAKE IT.
NO, NO, NO!

11:04.832 --> 11:07.234
TAKE IT!
NO! IT IS BAD LUCK

11:07.267 --> 11:09.102
TO TALK TO A BRIDE
ON HER WEDDING DAY.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.138
OH, IT IS ONLY BAD LUCK
IF YOU SEE HER,

11:11.171 --> 11:11.839
AND IF YOU'RE THE GROOM.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.206
OK, ENOUGH
HAS HAPPENED TODAY.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.274
I JUST DON'T
WANNA RISK IT.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.344
RISK WHAT? THIS ISN'T ABOUT
FATE, THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.479
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THIS IS
ABOUT YOU, OK?

11:19.512 --> 11:23.150
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR GENES.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.119
MY GENES?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.789
YOU HAVE A THING
FOR MUSICIANS, OK?

11:28.822 --> 11:29.689
IT'S IN YOUR DNA,

11:29.723 --> 11:31.992
AND NOW
YOU'VE PASSED
THIS GROUPIE GENE

11:32.025 --> 11:33.160
ONTO OUR DAUGHTER.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.964
OH, THAT
IS SO INSULTING.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.331
HOW SHALLOW
DO YOU THINK I AM?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.933
LOOK, WHY DID YOU
FALL FOR ME, OK?

11:39.967 --> 11:42.302
BECAUSE
I WAS IN A BAND.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.872
AND LOTS
OF OTHER REASONS.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.809
OH, YEAH?
GIMME ONE.

11:48.842 --> 11:49.877
YOU HAVE
BEAUTIFUL HANDS.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.814
I HAVE NAGGLY WHITE,
FRECKLY PASTY

11:53.847 --> 11:55.448
PINK IRISH HANDS.
YOU'RE LYING.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.751
OOH! UGH!

11:57.785 --> 11:59.853
YES, I'M
STILL HERE!

11:59.887 --> 12:00.720
HEY, DAD.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.523
HEY, EDDIE,
DID YOU BRING ME
ANY CAKE?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.257
NO.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.794
BUT I BROUGHT YOU
SOME SHRIMPS.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.997
JUMBO!

12:10.030 --> 12:11.965
WHAT'S THIS GUY
DOING IN MY HOUSE?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.934
OH, SAME AS ME.
HE WANTS HIS MONEY.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.905
OH, OH, I THOUGHT
HE WAS ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.973
YEAH, BIG PROBLEM.
THERE WASN'T ANY MUSIC,

12:20.007 --> 12:21.108
SO I WANT MY MONEY.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.143
I WASN'T ASKING YOU.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.812
HEY, WAIT
IN THE KITCHEN.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.213
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.547
SO
YOU'RE DEAN?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.248
YEAH, WHY?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.883
HEY, WATCH
THE SASS, MUSIC BOY,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.019
I GOT DISPOSABLE
RAZORS OLDER THAN YOU.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.520
HEY, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:33.553 --> 12:38.859
2 THINGS...I'M OLDER
AND I'VE GOT RAZORS.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.759
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

12:39.793 --> 12:43.130
YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING LIKE A JERK
ALL WEEK.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.169
TOWEL?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.037
NO, THANKS.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.339
UH, YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE SWEATY THERE.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.207
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M COOL.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.910
I-I'LL JUST
LEAVE THIS HERE.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.578
HE DOESN'T
WANT A TOWEL, OK!

12:58.611 --> 13:01.014
HE TOLD YOU HE
DOESN'T WANT A TOWEL,

13:01.048 --> 13:01.815
SO WHY ARE YOU
TRYING TO FORCE

13:01.849 --> 13:03.984
A TOWEL ON A MAN
WHO QUITE OBVIOUSLY

13:04.017 --> 13:06.286
IS NOT IN NEED
OF A TOWEL?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.857
OK?!

13:10.123 --> 13:12.926
I CAN DO IT.
I'M CLASSICALLY TRAINED.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.894
STOP FOLLOWING ME!

13:13.927 --> 13:15.996
JUST ASK YOUR DAD
TO GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.966
QUIT BUMPING
INTO ME WITH THAT!

13:18.999 --> 13:21.034
LILY, TAKE ALL THAT
STUFF BACK TO THE CAR.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.936
DAD, CAN YOU JUST
STOP BEING SO SELFISH?

13:22.970 --> 13:25.939
ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE
RUINING THE MOST
PRECIOUS DAY OF...

13:25.973 --> 13:28.075
WHAT'S-HER-NAME'S LIFE.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.476
YES, SWEETIE, SEE,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.178
YOUR DAD'S BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS A LOT,

13:31.211 --> 13:32.980
AND HE'S CONCERNED
THAT YOUR DNA,

13:33.013 --> 13:34.214
WHICH YOU INHERITED
FROM ME,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.284
IS CAUSING YOU TO HAVE
THE HOT PANTS FOR DEAN.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.253
WHAT?! I DON'T HAVE
THE HOT PANTS FOR DEAN.

13:40.287 --> 13:44.024
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HOT PANTS ARE.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.960
I--I THINK IT MEANS
YOU LIKE HIM.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.097
EW! I--I DO NOT
LIKE HIM.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.999
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU PULLED
ALL THIS STUFF

13:52.032 --> 13:55.035
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
THE HOT PANTS
FOR THE KID.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.203
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

13:56.236 --> 13:59.372
I DON'T, OK?
I HATE HIM!

14:01.141 --> 14:03.143
SORRY, BUD,
BUT, UH...

14:03.176 --> 14:04.978
YOU'RE NOT
WANTED HERE.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.179
RIGHT,
WHO ARE YOU?

14:06.213 --> 14:08.982
I'M LILY'S BOYFRIEND.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.252
HA HA! HE IS NOT
MY BOYFRIEND.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.087
YEAH,
SHE LOVES YOU.

14:14.121 --> 14:17.057
NO, I DON'T!

14:17.090 --> 14:18.025
SEE? NOW GET
OUT HERE!

14:18.058 --> 14:21.528
DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO GET
BAND GEEK OFF OF ME?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.230
OH, YOU'D LIKE THAT
WOULDN'T YOU?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.198
YOU WANT A PIECE
OF ME?

14:25.232 --> 14:28.168
JUST GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!

14:29.102 --> 14:32.039
RUN AWAY, LOSER!

14:32.072 --> 14:33.673
AAH!

14:33.706 --> 14:37.510
[DRUM BANGING
AND CRASHING]

14:37.544 --> 14:40.280
Brad: I-I'M OK, LILY!

14:41.381 --> 14:45.185
A-A-A-AAH!

14:45.552 --> 14:49.089
HEH HOO! BABY, SOME DAY
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO

14:49.122 --> 14:51.158
FINALLY DEAL
WITH ALL THIS, OK?

14:51.191 --> 14:52.559
GIRLS LIKE BOYS.
MM-HMM.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.427
SOMETIMES GIRLS FALL
IN LOVE WITH BOYS.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.428
OCCASIONALLY,
THEY GET MARRIED

14:55.462 --> 14:57.164
AND THEN
THEY NEED A BAND.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.133
OH, GOD. PAULINA
DOES NOT NEED A BAND.

15:00.167 --> 15:04.071
DAD, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LIST OF SONGS
SHE REQUESTED.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.109
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
A REALLY GREAT SONG?

15:09.142 --> 15:10.010
Sean: NO.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.544
REUNITED BY PEACHES
AND HERB.

15:11.578 --> 15:15.115
OH, GOD, COME ON,
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.283
IT'S NICE.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.086
I BET YOU COULD
PLAY IT.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.620
OH! OH, GOD.

15:20.653 --> 15:24.091
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A PLAY LIST.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.059
OH, DEAR GOD!

15:26.093 --> 15:28.128
COME ON, IT'S JUST
A FEW SONGS.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.963
IT'S HER WEDDING.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.264
PEACHES AND ERB?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.633
HERB. THEY'RE ARE
WORSE SONGS.

15:33.666 --> 15:38.105
OH, YEAH, HOW ABOUT
SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.373
DID YOU
PEEK AT THIS?

15:40.407 --> 15:44.277
OH, NO! JUST KILL ME,
GOD, NOW, PLEASE.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.113
THERE'S SOME
ROCKERS ON THERE.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.549
WHAT, LOOK, Y.M.C.A?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.384
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT ONE
ALONE, HUH?

15:51.418 --> 15:54.254
EVERYONE'LL BE
SINGING ALONG, DOING
THE LITTLE DANCE--

15:54.287 --> 15:56.189
BABY, DO WE HAVE TO
DO THIS?

15:56.223 --> 15:57.257
YES.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.758
OHH, NO!

15:58.791 --> 16:01.194
COME ON, BABY.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.430
I LOVE YOU.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.466
* I HONESTLY LOVE YOU

16:10.103 --> 16:12.039
OH, NO.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.506

16:13.540 --> 16:18.078

16:18.111 --> 16:23.250

* AND, SUGAR,
THIS ONE IS IT *

16:29.822 --> 16:34.161
* WE BOTH ARE SO EXCITED
'CAUSE WE'RE *

16:34.194 --> 16:39.199
* REUNITED, HEY, HEY

16:39.232 --> 16:40.067
SO THERE ARE I AM

16:40.100 --> 16:42.602
PLAYING SOFT ROCK HITS
FROM THE SEVENTIES

16:42.635 --> 16:44.104
AND BEYOND, ALL RIGHT,

16:44.137 --> 16:45.672
AND I'M WATCHING
MY DAUGHTER

16:45.705 --> 16:49.142
MOPPING SWEAT OFF
THE GUY WHO'S...

16:49.176 --> 16:52.045
GONNA MAKE YOU
THE YOUNGEST
GRANDFATHER

16:52.079 --> 16:55.182
SINCE, UH...ME?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.249
YEAH.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.218
YEAH, DAD, YEAH,
YEAH, HONESTLY,

16:58.251 --> 16:59.452
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
AFRAID OF, YOU KNOW,

16:59.486 --> 17:01.188
AND I THOUGHT I HAD
NO WAY OUT,

17:01.221 --> 17:04.624
AND THEN, OK,
LIKE A GIFT FROM THE GODS,

17:04.657 --> 17:06.093
THIS KID DEAN HANDS ME

17:06.126 --> 17:09.362
THE WEAPON OF HIS OWN
DESTRUCTION.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.163
I CAN'T BELIEVE

17:10.197 --> 17:12.199
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
PLAY THESE SONGS.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.334
I KNOW. IT IS
SO UNCOOL.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.203
NO OFFENSE
OR ANYTHING, LILY,

17:16.236 --> 17:19.472
BUT YOUR OLD MAN'S
A BUTTWAD.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.040
NONE TAKEN.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.742
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
HE WANTED TO ROCK.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.311
HE DOESN'T
WANT TO ROCK,

17:24.344 --> 17:24.977
I WANT TO ROCK.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.347
I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT'S SO SAD.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.782
AND THE OTHER DAY
I CAUGHT HIM WATCHING VH1.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.684
I CAN'T STAND
THIS STUFF.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.153
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO PLAY

17:33.186 --> 17:36.323
THE CHICKEN DANCE
AND NOT THROW UP?

17:36.356 --> 17:38.291
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE--

17:38.325 --> 17:40.193
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
THROW UP, YOU KNOW?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.262
THAT'LL SHOW HIM.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.096
MAYBE I SHOULD.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.732
MAYBE SHOULD BECAUSE
I HAVE INTEGRITY.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.300
HELL, YEAH.
YEAH.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.136
THERE IT WAS,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

17:49.169 --> 17:50.203
DEAN'S ACHILLES HEEL.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.641
INTEGRITY, MAN!
I HAVE INTEGRITY!

17:55.342 --> 17:58.745
WHAT THE HOLY HECK
DO TEENAGERS KNOW
ABOUT INTEGRITY?

17:58.778 --> 18:02.715
NOTHING, BUT THEY TAKE IT
VERY SERIOUSLY.

18:02.749 --> 18:07.854
* REUNITED, HEY, HEY

18:07.887 --> 18:10.390
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
THAT WAS GOOD, GOOD.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.424
OH, JUST
A COUPLE THINGS.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.194
UM, DEAN,
YOU KNOW THAT PART
WHERE I'M SINGING...

18:14.227 --> 18:19.766
* LOVER, LOVER,
THIS IS SOLID LOVE *

18:19.799 --> 18:22.402
* AND YOU'RE EXACTLY
WHAT I-- *

18:22.435 --> 18:23.836
YOU KNOW THAT PART
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

18:23.870 --> 18:26.473
AT THE PAUSE,
CAN YOU JUST SPIN
YOUR STICK

18:26.506 --> 18:28.208
LIKE THE DRUMMER
FROM LOVERBOY?

18:28.241 --> 18:30.243
THAT WOULD BE
JUST AWESOME.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.111
EXCUSE ME?
NOTHING.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.213
NO, I THOUGHT
I HEARD YOU SAY
SOMETHING.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.249
PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T--IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY,

18:36.283 --> 18:37.350
SAY IT. I DON'T
WANT TO STIFLE

18:37.384 --> 18:42.155
ANYONE'S CREATIVITY
OR INTEGRITY.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.324
LOOK, IT'S JUST, UH...

18:44.357 --> 18:46.393
THIS SONG'S CRAP.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.560
EXCUSE ME?

18:47.594 --> 18:48.561
IT'S A CRAPPY SONG.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.364
I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.266
WOW.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.066
CRAPPY SONG, HUH?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.702
I HAPPEN TO THINK
THIS IS A CLASSIC.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.339
REUNITED
IS A HAUNTING
EXPRESSION

18:59.372 --> 19:02.209
OF PURE, HOT HUMAN
NEED AND DESIRE,

19:02.242 --> 19:04.377
AND IF YOU
CAN'T UNDERSTAND

19:04.411 --> 19:06.446
THE AESTHETIC BEAUTY
OF PEACHES AND ERB--

19:06.479 --> 19:07.113
HERB.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.383
THEN YOU CAN--
I WOULD GLADLY

19:10.417 --> 19:12.352
