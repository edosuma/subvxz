15:21.129 --> 15:23.881
Exactly. You don't
wanna take your
Caddie there.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.217
Kevin, this is a gold mine.
You almost let it get away.

let it get away.

<i>That's what they want.</i>

15:59.959 --> 16:01.794

to bring this to you.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.135
When?

16:52.845 --> 16:53.638
When did he ask me?

16:53.638 --> 16:56.557
Yeah.
Just now.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.644
On your lunch break?

16:59.644 --> 17:01.812
That hardly seems fair.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.775
I almost never go to lunch,
sir. Too much to do.
Oh.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.027
I just grab something.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.905

I'd make a point

17:10.905 --> 17:14.617
of taking that hour or so
away from all the noise
and insanity of this place.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.329
I should do that.
I'd find a place for myself
where I could go

17:18.329 --> 17:20.830
that was relatively quiet
and peaceful.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.291
Have a sandwich,
read a magazine.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.503
Maybe listen to a game
out at Fenway, if one was on.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.214
Hmm? And I'd make sure

17:28.214 --> 17:33.344
everyone knew I didn't want
to be disturbed during that
hour or so of solitude.

17:33.344 --> 17:37.348

time, my own private time,

17:37.348 --> 17:41.727

It's Foley Hoag's.
And that motion is?

my name is Jan Schlichtmann.

Your Honor, I'm sorry, but
I don't think it is simple.
May I hear it?

21:40.758 --> 21:43.052
No. You see, the true
intention of this motion
is to try to place me

21:43.052 --> 21:46.639
under a cloud of impropriety
in your courtroom,
right from the beginning.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.100
Really?
Yes. What they're saying
with this motion

21:50.100 --> 21:51.769
is that they know the law
and I don't.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.396
What they're saying
is that they're real lawyers
and I'm not.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.607
They're just trying
to humiliate me.

21:56.607 --> 22:00.277
Mr. Schlichtmann, you are
a personal injury lawyer,
are you not?

22:00.277 --> 22:03.447
I think you'll survive that.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.116
You see,
it's starting already.
No, you've started already.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.203
No, I'm on the defensive
already, and they're
the defendants.

22:09.203 --> 22:12.790
Mr. Schlichtmann, I...
Do you think I might at least
hear this motion

22:12.790 --> 22:16.210
before you explain
to me what it's
really about?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.171

22:27.054 --> 22:30.850
Cheeseman.
Cheeseman.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.478
Your motion to dismiss
is based on?
Uh, rule 11, Your Honor.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.107
Uh, specifically on the fact
that, uh, Mr. Schlichtmann...

22:38.107 --> 22:40.150
(SQUEAKING)
... had absolutely
no evidential grounds

22:40.150 --> 22:43.821
on which to bring this
suit, only his knowledge
that my client, uh,

22:43.821 --> 22:46.615
the W. R. Grace corporation
has a lot of money.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.535
Not true.
CHEESEMAN: Uh, he performed
no real investigation,

22:49.535 --> 22:51.662
he did no research
of any consequence,

22:51.662 --> 22:55.541
uh, except perhaps to review
profit statements,

22:55.541 --> 23:00.504
and, uh, he's prepared
his complaint so inexpertly
as to render it moot.

23:00.504 --> 23:04.675
All untrue.
Do you know what rule 11 is,
Mr. Schlichtmann?

23:04.675 --> 23:08.012
Well, to be honest
with you, Your Honor, I,
uh, I had to look it up.

23:08.012 --> 23:12.057
SKINNER:
I'll be honest too. So did I.
(CHUCKLES)

23:12.057 --> 23:14.602
Do you know why,
Mr. Cheeseman?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.854
Because it is so old
and ambiguous,

23:16.854 --> 23:21.191
few lawyers waste
their time with it, or mine.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.193
It's a non-issue,
Mr. Cheeseman.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.195
Your motion is denied.
Thank you.

Thank you.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.038
Excuse me, Mr. Facher.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.708
I'd like to thank you.
That was very
statesmanlike of you

23:37.708 --> 23:39.877
not to join in that
ridiculous attack.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.211
Oh.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.505
You're welcome.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.679
MAN: Well, what we have
to do is show how
the toxic solvent

23:50.679 --> 23:52.348
from these two factories
dumped on the land there

23:52.348 --> 23:57.811
migrated underground and
were drawn into city wells
here and well h over there.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.689
And was then pumped into
the homes of east Woburn.
Right.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.317
And to do that
is quite simple, really.
I'll need to inspect the land,

24:03.317 --> 24:06.987
map out the location of
debris, drill some monitoring
wells, conduct seismic tests

24:06.987 --> 24:08.906
and so on.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.075
Right.

24:11.075 --> 24:15.287
And you're talking about
you and a couple of
assistants or something.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.415
No. No, I mean a team
of geologists and engineers.

24:18.415 --> 24:22.252
A team.
Mmm. A big team.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.925
You see, it's actually
quite exciting

24:27.925 --> 24:31.345
because the nature
of the contour here means
that there's an effect

24:31.345 --> 24:32.972
which is named after me,
as a matter of fact,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.641
uh, where the, the flow
of the aquifer goes against
the gravitational pull.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.602
JAN: Working in the Grace
paint shop, Mr. Barbas,

24:38.602 --> 24:40.938
I'd imagine you'd use paint
thinners and solvents.
Uh-huh.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.690
To clean your
brushes and things.
Uh-huh.

24:42.690 --> 24:48.195
I wonder what you would have
done with that stuff, say back
in the 1970s, early '80s.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.280
Used solvent?
Yeah.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.907
Put it in drums.
Fifty-five-gallon drums.

24:51.907 --> 24:55.452
Uh-huh.
And, uh, what would you do
with those drums

24:55.452 --> 24:56.996
when they were filled up?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.706
Don't know.
They were just gone.

24:58.706 --> 25:02.710
Never noticed.
You never dumped
them out back?

25:02.710 --> 25:04.586
No.
Never did anything
like that.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.798
No.
Never, never noticed
anyone who did.

25:07.798 --> 25:12.302
No.
Hmm.
Just disappeared.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.472
What were your duties
at Grace back then,
Mr. Shalline?

25:15.472 --> 25:18.308
Receive disposal and
discharge to the drains.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.102
Be sure we weren't
polluting the air and
things of that nature.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.855
Well, then you must
know then that over the
years certain chemicals

25:22.855 --> 25:27.109
were deposited
on the ground in
back of the plant.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.235
SHALLINE:
I don't know that.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.612
JAN: Six barrels
of toxic waste,
Mr. Shalline,

25:30.612 --> 25:34.158
were found out in back
of the plant in a pit

25:34.158 --> 25:35.242
and exhumed
by city inspectors.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.244
You never heard
anything about this?
Nope.

25:37.244 --> 25:41.081
JAN: Back then in 1965 or
thereafter, did you clean
metal parts with any type

25:41.081 --> 25:42.249
of solvent?

25:42.249 --> 25:45.627
Yes.
What kind?

25:45.627 --> 25:48.672
That I couldn't tell you.
Did you ever notice,

25:48.672 --> 25:51.842
uh, the, uh, name
trichloroethylene or TCE?

25:51.842 --> 25:55.637
Nah. I don't know.
But you'd put it in barrels
when you were done with it.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.638
That seems to be
the process, right?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.933
Yes.
Did you ever see
what happened

25:59.933 --> 26:03.520
to these barrels of solvent
when you were through
with them?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.855
Yes.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.533
What was that?

26:19.244 --> 26:20.662
They get dumped.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.207
Hmm. Where?

26:23.207 --> 26:26.376
Out back,
in the ground.
You saw this?

26:26.376 --> 26:28.879
Yes.
JAN: When?

26:28.879 --> 26:31.840
Um, my coffee break.
I, uh, loved to go out

26:31.840 --> 26:34.760
and hit nine iron shots
with golf balls.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.513
(STAMMERS) Do you wanna
take a little break?

26:37.513 --> 26:40.891
JAN: Do you...
Do you need a break?
No.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.685
Did you see who was out there,
um, dumping the stuff

26:43.685 --> 26:46.271
when you were hitting
your golf balls?

26:47.356 --> 26:48.982
What do you mean?

26:48.982 --> 26:49.733
The names of the people.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.491
He wants to tell us.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.409
He's not gonna tell us.
He has to work there.

26:59.409 --> 27:03.247
JAN: He has to work there,
but he lives across the street
from Anne Anderson.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.832
He has to see
her every day.

have any children?

27:35.237 --> 27:37.614
Yes, I do.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.741
Eight of 'em.
Eight? (LAUGHING)

27:39.741 --> 27:42.911
My goodness!
That's quite a family.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.666
What do
you think of the
water in Woburn?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.628
Now?
It's all right.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.464
What about then?
Ten, 15 years ago?

27:54.464 --> 27:56.466
Had an odor then.
Hmm.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.386
Chlorine or somethin'.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.471
Did you drink it?
Yeah, I drank it.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.557
Your kids?

28:04.850 --> 28:05.809
Yes.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.523
Were you concerned
when you found out the
wells were contaminated?

28:11.523 --> 28:15.402
I'm going to object to that.
You don't, you don't have
to answer that.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.865
Yeah, I was
concerned.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.035
JAN: For your
family's health?
Yes.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.163
Has any member of your
family had any illness
out of the ordinary?

28:26.163 --> 28:30.459
You don't have to
answer any of these
type of questions.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.171
Yeah, they have.
What kind?

28:34.171 --> 28:36.006
LOVE: One of
my sons has a
seizure disorder.

28:36.006 --> 28:41.011
And, uh, my oldest daughter's
had two miscarriages and my
youngest boy was born with...

28:41.011 --> 28:45.182
Are we gonna sit here all day
and go through his entire
family's medical history?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.017
Well, if you don't
wanna hear it, then leave.

28:47.017 --> 28:50.687
I don't know what you're doing
here anyway. We're deposing
Grace employees, not Beatrice.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.690
LAWYER: If you're
deposing anybody, anybody,
I have a right to be here.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.983
JAN: Well, then
sit down and shut up!

29:07.287 --> 29:08.956
Mr. Love,

29:08.956 --> 29:13.627
are you aware that some
of your neighbors have had
leukemia in their families?

29:14.336 --> 29:16.588
Yes, I am.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.800
They think it's the water.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.929
Al, that water
hasn't made anybody sick.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
How do you know?

29:29.977 --> 29:31.436
I just do.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.899
There's a lot of
people in my neighborhood
that are dead,

29:35.899 --> 29:38.944
or dyin', Mr. Chessman,
from somethin'.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.030
Look, if I, uh...

29:42.030 --> 29:45.742
If I took 100
pennies and threw
'em up in the air,

29:45.742 --> 29:50.080
about half of 'em would
land heads and the
other half tails, right?

29:50.080 --> 29:53.750
Now if I looked around
closely, I'd probably find
some heads grouped together

29:53.750 --> 29:57.796
in a cluster. What does
that mean? Does that
mean anything?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.966
See, no one knows
what causes leukemia, Al.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.468
No one knows
what caused
that cluster.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.098
I know what
happened.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.766
And I know who did it.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.813
Um,

30:14.813 --> 30:17.482
Al, this is,
uh, this is very
important, uh...

30:18.525 --> 30:21.445
I want you to tell me
who those people are.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.781
I'm not a rat.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.992
You know, it's,
uh, it's important
because, uh,

30:26.992 --> 30:29.119
if there is something
wrong out there,
we need,

30:29.119 --> 30:31.163
we need to disclose it
to the proper authorities.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.583
We need to get
'em out there and
have it cleaned up.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.923
You, uh, you think
about that and,
and call me if y...

30:41.923 --> 30:43.050
Yeah. Yeah.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.943
Thank you.
You're welcome.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.745
Do you eat peanut butter?

31:13.205 --> 31:15.082
No.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.167
You've never eaten
peanut butter?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.376
I guess everyone alive
has probably tried it,

31:18.376 --> 31:22.130
but I'm not exactly
what you'd call a
peanut butter fan.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.009
What about your
son? Did he ever
eat peanut butter?

31:30.055 --> 31:33.558

Do you eat bacon?
Yes.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.102
Yes. How often?
How many slices?

(CHOMPS)

32:01.253 --> 32:03.880
So you were aware
when you moved to Woburn

32:03.880 --> 32:06.383
that its water
didn't taste so good.

32:06.383 --> 32:11.555
Yeah, but, a lot
of places the water
doesn't taste so good.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.932
FACHER: I agree with that.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.892
Did you ever consider
using bottled water?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.727
We use bottled water,
uh, off and on.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.188
Split half and half.

32:20.188 --> 32:24.067
Like, uh, we, uh,
cooked with regular
water, tap water.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.529
And we did other
things like, uh,
make orange juice.

32:27.529 --> 32:32.450
But to, uh, drink
just straight water,
we drank bottled water.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.911
Has any doctor ever
told you that you've
had any dysfunction

32:34.911 --> 32:38.665
of your immune system?
No,

32:38.665 --> 32:43.003
but, uh, when my
son died, they told us
that that was why he died.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.797
His, uh, immune
system was

32:46.756 --> 32:48.550
tore down to nothin'.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.972
Uh,

32:53.972 --> 32:55.932
why did you have
an autopsy?

32:55.932 --> 32:58.351
Because he,
he was doin' good.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.687
He only, uh,
lived three months
with leukemia,

33:00.687 --> 33:04.274
and, uh,
he looked fine.

33:04.274 --> 33:07.194
Did you talk to the
doctor about this?

33:07.194 --> 33:10.614
Yeah, I had more
like a, uh, violent
talk with him.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.659
Violent. you mean,
you were angry.

33:14.659 --> 33:18.288
Yellin' at him.

33:18.288 --> 33:21.917
Your son seemed
to be doing all right.
He, he was in remission.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.793
You were optimistic
about his future

33:23.793 --> 33:26.755
and suddenly he
became ill and died.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.298
And they said
that was expected.

33:28.298 --> 33:32.385
That, uh, anybody
with a disease
like leukemia

33:32.385 --> 33:33.136
could die
any minute.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.140
But you were
angry and upset.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.518
My son just died.

33:40.518 --> 33:45.148
I understand.
I'm just trying to,
to recreate the event.

when your child
isn't feeling well.

to explain it to
them on the phone,

33:50.528 --> 33:53.323
and they say,
uh, "Has he got
a temperature?"

33:53.323 --> 33:56.618
You say no.
"He's all right then,"
they say.

33:56.618 --> 34:00.205
"Don't worry.
Bring him into the
clinic Monday morning."

34:02.582 --> 34:04.668

stopped breathing.

there would only be seven.

more likely we're
gonna have probably 12.

to answer my question.

What exactly do
you intend to say
to me, Mr. Riley,

38:22.091 --> 38:24.594
by pouring a glass
of water on my table?

38:24.594 --> 38:30.099
This is how silicone is put
on leather to waterproof it.

your question.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.479

You poured water
on my table.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.234
Yeah. Correct.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.236

must spill off the leather

spilling off my table.

Your geologists have cost
more than 500,000.

Well, they're worth it.
That's not the point.

40:56.245 --> 40:59.874
The point is, everybody
in the firm's working
only on this case.

40:59.874 --> 41:03.086
That means we have no money
coming in, just going out.
So what?

our losses now? Is that
what you wanna do, Gordon?

56:29.886 --> 56:31.346

56:31.346 --> 56:32.764
We start with
the scientific
evidence

56:32.764 --> 56:34.850
and then the medical
experts and their
evidence,

56:34.850 --> 56:38.061
then the parents,
and then your
testimony.

56:38.061 --> 56:41.106
Now, your presence
is very important
in the courtroom.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.692
This is where the jury
gets to know you.

56:43.692 --> 56:45.777
Well, if you're there some
days and not other days,
they say,

56:45.777 --> 56:48.864
"Well, why wasn't she
there?" and "Does she
really care?"

56:48.864 --> 56:49.906
And this kind of thing.

56:49.906 --> 56:52.034
I'll be there every day.

you're most comfortable.

56:55.704 --> 56:56.997

in the grocery store
or the...

57:01.376 --> 57:03.086

JAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

57:54.304 --> 57:57.683
there's a small town north
of Boston called Woburn.

57:57.683 --> 58:02.020
Now, Woburn is
like many small towns.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.106
It has homes.
It has churches.

58:04.106 --> 58:06.316
It has schools.
It has industry.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.902
But Woburn has
something else.

58:08.902 --> 58:15.198
It has more than its
share of sickness
and death.

58:15.198 --> 58:18.870
CHEESEMAN: It's true small
amounts of solvents were
left on the ground.

58:19.705 --> 58:21.456
Why? To evaporate.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.251
Did they? Yes.
These chemicals

58:24.251 --> 58:26.962

58:26.962 --> 58:30.590
almost half a mile away,
and we will show that.

58:30.590 --> 58:34.803
And they never made
anyone sick, and we
will show that too.

58:34.803 --> 58:38.724
FACHER: The idea of criminal
court is crime and punishment.

58:38.724 --> 58:42.644
The idea of civil court
and of personal injury law,
by nature,

58:42.644 --> 58:44.896
though no one likes
to say it out loud,
least of all

58:44.896 --> 58:48.150
the, uh, personal injury
lawyer himself,

58:48.150 --> 58:50.777
(CHUCKLES) is money.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.904
Money for suffering,
money for death.

58:52.904 --> 58:56.491
As if that could somehow
relieve suffering,

58:56.491 --> 58:58.535
as if that could
somehow

58:58.535 --> 59:01.663
bring dead children

Uh, during the end
of the last Ice Age.

59:22.350 --> 59:26.646

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:02.849
Uh, nothing.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.271
FACHER: A plaintiff's case
depends on momentum.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.606
The fewer objections he gets,

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.608
the better his

I can't not object
when you phrase
questions so improperly.

Mr. Riley, you own

to often

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:32.280
JAN: All right,
finally the families.
<i>He died Monday morning.</i>

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.157
We'll start with
Jimmy Anderson.
(TAPE CONTINUES)

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.117
We count his trips
to the hospital,

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.952
the futile
chemotherapy treatments.
(PHONE RINGING)

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.787
Then the other kids,
one by one,

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:41.956
ending with Jarrod Aufiero...
(RINGING CONTINUES)

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.708
...dying in his father's
arms on the highway.

Where is everybody?

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.385
You're just noticing now?

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.471
Gordon laid everybody
off two weeks ago.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.305
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Gordon?

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.267
Instead of sitting there
reading a magazine,

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:04.145
why don't you go to
Uncle Pete and get
me a staff?

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.314
That's a good idea.
(RINGING CONTINUES)

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:07.690
Why didn't I think of that?

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:10.818
(CONTINUES RINGING)

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.863
Hello.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:27.627
(EXHALES)

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.128
I was told there
was a Cheeseman
on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:30.838
SECRETARY: This way, sir.
JAN: Thank you.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:33.091
SKINNER: Ah, Jan,
have a seat.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:36.094
You want something
to drink? Some coffee,
soda?

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.596
You've been talking
without my being present?

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:41.140
(SIGHS)

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.851
No, we have been
drinking coffee without
your being present.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.104
Don't be so paranoid.
They were early.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:50.191
All right. What's up?

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.194
Jerry?

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:56.197
FACHER: Last night,
I... I was at a ball game.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.950
It was the seventh
inning stretch,

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.368
and I was standing there,
and I don't know why,

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:03.204
but it occurred to me
at that moment,

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:06.207
that unless you've
proven that any, uh...

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.583
What word should we use?
Uh, chemicals?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.044
Poisons.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.504
All right.
If you like that word,
I'll use it.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:15.216
Unless you've proven that
any poisons actually
reached the wells,

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.469
there's no case.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:22.140
And, therefore,
no need to make
these families,

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.058
who've already
suffered so much,

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.810
relive their suffering
all over again

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.772
by putting them
on the stand.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:35.486
Your Honor, you've got...
That's interesting.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:36.946
What?

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.865
I think I'd have
to agree with that.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:40.867
Well, Your Honor...
Yes,

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:45.287
if the jury decides
favorably on the
geological evidence,

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.582
yes, then you could
bring your families in.
Otherwise...

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.460
Your Honor, the jury came
into this courtroom expecting
a human drama.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.252
I don't care what
they expect.
Instead, for three months,

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.255
we've been giving them
lessons in geology.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:56.924
Now, we had to do that,
but now it's over, finally.

01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:58.509
Now it's time...
Now

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.219
we have to see where
we are before we can
move on.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.055
And before we subject
these families

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.183
to more trauma
than is necessary...

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.060
Because that would
just be cruel.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.270
JAN: They...
They want to testify.
SKINNER: Mr. Schlichtmann.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.563
They need to testify!
The decision
has been made.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.689
Well, this is
the defendant's plan.
No, it's my plan.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:15.651
This is Facher's plan right
from the beginning.
It's my plan.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.278
He told me.
He threatened me.
It's my plan!

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.331
Now...

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:34.127
My plan is to
present the jury

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:36.756
with some simple questions.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:40.218
SKINNER: Indeed,
how you answer these
three questions

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:42.636
will determine whether
or not this trial continues.

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.807
It's not that
I disagree with them.
I don't understand them.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.975
What don't you understand?
They're straightforward
questions.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:52.188
"Have the plaintiffs
established by preponderance
of evidence

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.816
"that chemicals

"and did those chemicals

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.415
These dates, for one thing.
What... What are they?

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:13.793
Wh... Where did they come
from? From out of a hat?

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.420
SKINNER: Question two.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.504
"What, according
to a preponderance

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.473
JAN: <i>How can they</i>
<i>determine that?</i>

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.267
Science can't
even determine...

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.102
When... When the chemicals
arrived at the wells

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.520
with the precision that
you're asking of the jurors.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.523
And, finally, three.

"was caused, if it was,
by the negligent conduct

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.540
What does that mean?
It's... It's like English

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.167
translated into Japanese
back into English again.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.543
Mr. Schlichtmann,
I've heard enough.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:58.713
Your Honor, no one can
answer these questions.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:00.882
I worked very hard
on these questions.
You're asking for answers

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.550
that are unknowable.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.052
I said I have heard enough.
You're asking these people
to create a fiction...

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:08.890
That will stand for the truth,
but won't be the truth.
Enough!

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.518
Once again,
I remind you

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:16.105
not to discuss your views
with any outside party

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.356

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:22.445
