00:02.132 --> 00:03.046
Previously onElementary...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.265
The headaches are getting worse?

00:04.308 --> 00:05.396
And more frequent.
They're interfering with

00:05.440 --> 00:09.009
my focus, my sleep,
my existence.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.706
You have to ask yourself--
do you want to get by,

00:10.749 --> 00:13.317
or do you want to get better?
If you want to get by,

00:13.361 --> 00:14.884
we can try some different
medications,

00:14.927 --> 00:16.581
but if you want
to get better,

00:16.625 --> 00:19.019
the best option
is a very long vacation.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.150
There have been no new leads

00:20.194 --> 00:21.978
in the disappearance
of Polly Kenner.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.111
GREGSON: Hannah came
to see me last night.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.287
She told me she's an alcoholic.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.289
I guess she's on
whatever step it is

00:28.332 --> 00:29.812
where you tell your dad.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.553
There's a guy outside.
Says he's looking

00:31.596 --> 00:33.990
for the owner of a parked car
that he just hit.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.470
Hey. You Hannah?

00:35.513 --> 00:36.688
Afraid so.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.394
[phone ringing]

00:46.437 --> 00:48.135
Watson?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.658
WATSON:
How's the headache?

00:49.701 --> 00:51.486
No, nothing helps.

00:51.529 --> 00:55.490
I was just about to submit
and hope that a long rest helps.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.492
That's not why you called,
is it?

00:57.535 --> 01:00.495
No. Hannah Gregson
just found her roommate

01:00.538 --> 01:03.106
strangled in her house.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.542
[sirens whooping][indistinct radio communication]

01:04.586 --> 01:06.370
HANNAH:
I got to call Maddie's parents.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.459
They were gonna come down
next month for her birthday.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.808
GREGSON:
It's all right.

01:09.852 --> 01:12.072
We got people
notifying the family.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.334
Can you think of anybody

01:13.377 --> 01:14.857
that would've wanted
to hurt Maddie?

01:14.900 --> 01:16.337
She was a
third-grade teacher

01:16.380 --> 01:18.861
and about the nicest
person I ever met.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.342
Any men in her life?No, not that I know of.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.691
Uh, her boyfriend
moved to Argentina

01:22.734 --> 01:24.562
a couple months ago.
She took it pretty hard.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.087
I don't think she'd even been
on a date since he left.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.914
This doesn't make sense.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.134
GREGSON: Right.
Uh, anything out of the ordinary

01:31.178 --> 01:32.353
when you came home?

01:32.396 --> 01:34.572
Anything out of place?
Anything?

01:34.616 --> 01:36.444
When I saw her,

01:36.487 --> 01:39.055
like, the second
before I realized...

01:39.099 --> 01:41.144
I thought it was weird.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.234
The way she was sitting,
like... like she was posed.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.715
Nothing about her
looked right.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.934
I-I don't know how
to describe it.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.893
GREGSON: Are we getting
anything from inside?

01:50.936 --> 01:52.460
No signs of forced entry.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.636
Nothing valuable
looks to be missing.

01:54.679 --> 01:57.508
CSU's still working,
but I'm not getting my hopes up.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.989
All the chatter's about how
careful this guy must've been.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.948
All right. I want you to stay
with Paige and me tonight.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.429
All right?
Yeah.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.222
You're still
right where I left you.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.224
I thought you'd be
in her room by now.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.182
I was, but I came back.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.228
Why?
Her clothes.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.926
This blouse, expensive.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.450
These dress pants,
they're cheap.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.409
Loose.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.541
The shoes, strange, they're...
they're out of fashion.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.761
Jewelry is mismatched, too.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.632
You think the killer
dressed her.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.112
We can check with Hannah,

02:36.156 --> 02:38.070
but I've been inside
this woman's closet,

02:38.114 --> 02:41.291
and I don't think anything
she's wearing belonged to her.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.207
If the killer
brought the outfit,

02:44.251 --> 02:45.382
what's the significance?

02:45.426 --> 02:46.644
It's not overtly sexual

02:46.688 --> 02:48.168
or flattering.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.213
I don't think he dressed her
for himself.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.433
I think he dressed her for us.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.739
There's dried blood
on these pants.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.959
But it's old.
It's not from anything

02:57.002 --> 02:58.787
that happened tonight.

02:58.830 --> 02:59.962
And look.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.311
This dark hair

03:01.355 --> 03:03.226
on her shoulder--
what's that doing

03:03.270 --> 03:04.445
on a blonde woman?

03:04.488 --> 03:06.142
Look.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.972
Pinpricks of blood
behind her earlobes.

03:10.015 --> 03:13.889
These amethyst studs
were forced through postmortem.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.239
She didn't have pierced ears.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
No, but the killer
was determined

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
to get the earrings on.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.767
He wouldn't settle
for an incomplete picture.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.509
She's not been dressed;
she's been decorated.

03:25.553 --> 03:28.033
And every ornament matters.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.513
You think everything
she's wearing

03:29.557 --> 03:31.167
was taken from other women?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.561
Not just other women.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.432
Other murder victims.

03:35.476 --> 03:39.523
If I'm right,
this is not just a homicide.

03:39.567 --> 03:43.788
This is a serial killer
announcing himself.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.879
â™ª

04:19.346 --> 04:21.043
For the last five years,
a serial killer

04:21.086 --> 04:22.784
has been preying
on women in New York,

04:22.827 --> 04:24.176
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.178
You've all been trying
to find him.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.224
You just didn't know it.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.313
Trenton and Allentown
saw multiple women

04:30.357 --> 04:33.055
go missing in 2014 and
2016 respectively.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.449
Nobody seemed to think
that these disappearances

04:35.492 --> 04:38.278
were orchestrated
by the same person.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.671
Uh, what makes you think
they are?

04:40.715 --> 04:42.020
He told us.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.196
Last night
Maddie Williams

04:44.240 --> 04:46.677
was strangled at her
home in Brooklyn.

04:46.721 --> 04:50.333
She was found dressed in ten

04:50.377 --> 04:52.335
individual garments
and pieces of jewelry,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.946
and they all seemed to have come
from missing women.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.426
GREGSON:
All the women

04:56.470 --> 04:59.864
on this top line,
we either have a DNA match

04:59.908 --> 05:01.953
or a photo from social media

05:01.997 --> 05:04.042
where they're seen
wearing something

05:04.086 --> 05:05.696
Ms. Williams had on.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.307
HOLMES:
We're still trying
to determine

05:07.350 --> 05:09.700
where the belt,
earrings and watch came from.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.441
It's possible
there's more victims out there.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.921
DETECTIVE: So, why the
coming-out party?

05:12.964 --> 05:15.445
Is he planning
on picking up the pace?

05:15.489 --> 05:19.057
It's not unusual for serials
to seek police attention.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.538
Zodiac, Son of Sam,
they wrote letters.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.933
This might just be his way
of waving at us.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.892
But my gut tells me
we better buckle up for more.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.329
Well, I've been on this
three years.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.156
I need to see
the crime lab reports,

05:31.200 --> 05:33.071
'cause I can't do anything else
with what I've got.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.812
You're gonna get all of it.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.814
We're gonna share,
and we're gonna share alike.

05:36.858 --> 05:40.252
But let's be clear--
this office is running point.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.081
This guy
is active here, now.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.736
Your bosses, the FBI,
we all agree.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.303
We're all pulling together
on this.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.740
HOLMES: So we'll start
with the obvious.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.700
Does anyone have a prime suspect
in any of these disappearances?

05:59.968 --> 06:01.578
How'd it go?Well, we had nothing.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.885
Now we have seven
times as much nothing.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.669
Well, we've got something.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.063
Just to be thorough,
we had the lab

06:08.106 --> 06:09.630
check all the DNA samples

06:09.673 --> 06:11.109
against closed cases--
not just open ones--

06:11.153 --> 06:12.763
and we got a hit on the strap

06:12.807 --> 06:14.461
from the watch
Ms. Williams was wearing.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.288
It belonged to
Ashley Jenkins.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.552
She was killed in
East Rutherford five years ago.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.075
She never went missing.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.772
She was found strangled
in her home like Maddie.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.252
The case was closed?

06:23.295 --> 06:26.124
Police in New Jersey
collared her husband, Graham.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.039
A jury convicted him.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.911
He's in prison?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.565
Has been for four
and a half years.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.829
Mrs. Jenkins would be one of our
killer's first victims.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.005
And I think he might have made
a rookie mistake, too.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.007
There's reason to believe
he got caught in the act.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.183
What do you mean?WATSON: At the trial,

06:41.226 --> 06:43.446
Graham Jenkins said he came
home and found his wife's body.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
There was plastic tubing
around her neck--

06:45.230 --> 06:46.623
again, like Maddie Williams.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.234
He said he saw a man
running out the back door

06:49.278 --> 06:50.671
just as he was walking in.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.456
He got a look at our guy?Sounds like it.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.284
But no one was interested
in his story.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.329
I am.
All right.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.810
Why don't you guys see if
you can find out whose belt

06:59.854 --> 07:01.595
and earrings
Ms. Williams had on.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.989
You and I are going
to New Jersey.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.513
It's time someone
finally listened

07:06.556 --> 07:08.906
to what Graham
Jenkins has to say.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.344
[lock buzzes]

07:12.388 --> 07:14.129
How's Hannah?

07:14.172 --> 07:16.044
[latch clicks]

07:16.087 --> 07:18.394
GREGSON: She didn't get
much sleep last night.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.353
Paige is looking
after her.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.355
She's a tough kid.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.488
Puts on a brave
face, but...

07:25.532 --> 07:27.925
You're not fooled.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.540
Events like this
can be a trigger.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.193
Yeah.

07:35.237 --> 07:38.283
It'd be a good idea
if she went to a meeting.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.069
How's your recovery going?

07:42.374 --> 07:43.898
Your other one.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.901
You don't look so good.Oh. Uh...

07:46.944 --> 07:48.380
I've been dealing
with a headache

07:48.424 --> 07:50.426
since yesterday,
but I'm fine.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.342
What?

07:53.385 --> 07:54.517
Someone told me once,

07:54.561 --> 07:56.214
don't be fooled
by a brave face.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.173
[door opens]

07:58.216 --> 08:00.218
Captain Gregson?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.354
[lock buzzes]

08:05.397 --> 08:07.356
That's... Yeah.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.966
The tubing.
That's the same thing

08:09.010 --> 08:11.316
that was wrapped
around Ashley's neck.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.971
GREGSON:
We read the transcripts

08:14.015 --> 08:15.930
from your trial,
Mr. Jenkins.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.628
Is there anything
else you can tell us

08:18.672 --> 08:20.195
about what the
guy looked like--

08:20.238 --> 08:22.110
the guy who ran
from your house?

08:22.153 --> 08:23.415
No. Just...

08:24.460 --> 08:26.331
He was tall and white.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.550
I think.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
You're not sure?

08:30.814 --> 08:32.686
I think about it
all the time.

08:32.729 --> 08:36.690
I... don't want
to, but I do.

08:36.732 --> 08:40.128
I live that moment
over and over.

08:40.171 --> 08:43.304
When I'm asleep,
I dream about it.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.960
Sometimes he's
tall and white.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.441
A lot of times, he's not.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.834
It's different.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.490
At this point,
I just don't know.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.319
The fact that this woman
was killed the same way--

08:57.362 --> 09:00.931
do you think that might be
enough to reopen my case?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.065
There's more than the M.O.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.984
That's Ashley's.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.465
Where did you get that?

09:13.509 --> 09:16.599
Ms. Williams was wearing it.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.211
Mr. Jenkins,

09:20.255 --> 09:22.126
we're going to contact
your lawyer, we're going to

09:22.170 --> 09:24.868
contact the state's attorney,
and tell them what we know.

09:24.912 --> 09:28.089
And then we're gonna find
the man who killed your wife.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.225
There's something else
you should know.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.618
He-he wrote to me.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
The killer-- he
wrote me a letter.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.882
When was this?

09:38.926 --> 09:40.754
Uh, two years ago.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.626
He didn't sign it, of course,
but it was from him.

09:43.670 --> 09:47.499
It said, "You were never meant
to take the fall.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.240
Sorry about that."

09:49.284 --> 09:51.634
That's all it said.You still have it?

09:51.678 --> 09:53.157
My lawyer does.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.985
He tried to get me a new trial,

09:55.029 --> 09:56.987
but they said
it's not proof of anything.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.337
They said I need proof.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.601
Then we'll find some.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.604
WOMAN: They're ours.
No question about it.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.345
They're also really tiny.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.651
I can't believe
you tracked these

10:08.695 --> 10:10.174
all the way back to my store.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.480
Yeah, it wasn't easy.

10:11.523 --> 10:12.829
We're hoping it'll be worth it.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.178
We want to identify everyone

10:14.222 --> 10:16.528
who ever bought a pair of those.

10:16.572 --> 10:20.010
You said you're
investigating a homicide?

10:20.054 --> 10:23.100
Is it the serial killer thing
I saw on the news?

10:23.144 --> 10:25.668
Did these belong to
someone he killed?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
All we can say at the moment

10:27.365 --> 10:29.193
is that the case
is very important.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.108
That's why we want everything
you've got

10:31.152 --> 10:33.110
on your customers,
all your sales records.

10:33.154 --> 10:37.854
Yeah, I-I wish I could help,
but we're pretty Stone Age here.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.683
This is, like, my
personal computer.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.685
We don't have a great
inventory system

10:42.729 --> 10:45.122
or a way to track
repeat customers or anything.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.124
You do take
credit cards, though.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.560
Those records might have

10:48.604 --> 10:50.693
the kind of information
we're looking for.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.174
You're welcome
to everything we've got.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.481
But a lot of our sales
are cash, and...

10:56.525 --> 10:59.180
those...

10:59.223 --> 11:01.878
they're a mess.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.663
On the plus side, I've
only got two employees.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.229
You should talk to them.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
They both worked here
when we sold those earrings.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.580
They might remember something.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.843
Here.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.235
They might remember
all the people

11:11.279 --> 11:12.846
who ever bought these earrings?

11:12.889 --> 11:15.979
Well, we only sold like
six pair, and they went quick.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.982
I got them from this really cool
designer up in Albany.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.680
We got them in...

11:20.723 --> 11:22.551
it was last Thanksgiving.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.553
I remember because
I wanted the designer

11:24.596 --> 11:26.511
to make more
for the holiday rush,

11:26.555 --> 11:27.817
but she was too busy.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.166
I don't suppose you still have

11:29.210 --> 11:30.820
the security footage
from back then?

11:30.864 --> 11:33.040
I don't have anything
from last week.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.695
We reuse the tapes
to save money.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.392
Sorry.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.527
You've been busy.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.529
Decorating. Not deducing.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.183
I had hoped
that one of these

11:46.227 --> 11:47.707
mundane horror stories
would provide a handhold,

11:47.750 --> 11:48.925
but so far
all I've encountered

11:48.969 --> 11:51.014
is subpar paperwork.

11:51.058 --> 11:54.061
There's been one
promising oddity.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.892
WATSON:
"You were never meant
to take the fall.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.632
Sorry about that."

12:00.676 --> 12:02.373
Graham Jenkins
received it in prison.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.724
He believes it's from the man
who killed his wife.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.595
Of course, it
wasn't signed,

12:06.638 --> 12:08.292
and it was
so woefully mishandled

12:08.336 --> 12:10.599
that there's no chance
of forensic analysis

12:10.642 --> 12:12.253
revealing the author's identity.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.733
If it is genuine,

12:13.776 --> 12:15.256
if the killer did send it,

12:15.299 --> 12:17.606
it was likely
to torment Mr. Jenkins.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.087
What intrigued me
was the postmark.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.393
WATSON:
It was sent from Vietnam.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.569
There's nothing here to suggest
a South Asian connection,

12:24.613 --> 12:26.310
but I could be
just missing it.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.922
Do you have any better
reason for optimism?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.619
Not really.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.273
The belt that Maddie was wearing

12:32.316 --> 12:34.536
came from a homeless woman
in Hoboken.

12:34.579 --> 12:38.409
So far, his victim profile
includes prostitutes, teachers,

12:38.453 --> 12:39.715
addicts, college students.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.456
This man
does not discriminate.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.980
It suggests that killing
is more about sport

12:44.024 --> 12:46.853
than it is a rage
against a certain type.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.985
There wasn't even
an open police file on this.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.726
Just some
social worker's report.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.293
Probably a dead end.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.077
Any progress with
the earrings?

12:54.121 --> 12:57.211
Um, they came from
a little shop in Williamsburg.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.083
The owner wasn't much help,
but I pulled security footage

13:00.127 --> 13:03.086
from a bank down the block
that had exterior cameras.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.785
It's a long shot,
but if the earrings

13:05.828 --> 13:08.744
were not a gift,
and if she walked past the bank,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.660
we may be able to use
facial recognition software

13:11.703 --> 13:14.619
to run the footage
against missing persons cases.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.752
So we could end up
with another thin file

13:16.796 --> 13:20.234
of stale police work to
pointlessly put on my walls.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.236
There has got to be
a pattern here somewhere.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.152
I just don't know if we're
going to find it tonight.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.895
When's the last time you slept?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.940
Night before last.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.507
And that headache
you've been fighting?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.422
That's worse.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.293
Unrelated, I'm sure.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.121
I'll rest when
I find this man.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.689
I want to find him, too,
but we have to pace ourselves.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.604
I'll retire to my sensory
deprivation chamber

13:42.647 --> 13:44.171
for one hour-- that's it.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
I'll go through the footage.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.175
If anything jumps out,
I'll come and get you.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.053
[mouse clicking]

14:03.146 --> 14:04.844
[sighs]

14:07.281 --> 14:10.284
You're wearing
the same clothes.

14:10.327 --> 14:14.201
[sighs] You never did get
into the tank, did you?

14:14.244 --> 14:15.767
Instead,

14:15.811 --> 14:18.466
you came up here to scrub
through security footage

14:18.509 --> 14:20.511
on these monitors,
which we both know

14:20.555 --> 14:22.252
is bad for your PCS.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.254
I found her.Who?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.648
The woman who bought
the earrings.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.567
WATSON: I don't see a bag
from the jewelry store.

14:32.610 --> 14:36.179
It must be in her purse or
her pocket, because that's her.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.833
How can you be sure?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.966
Because I've
seen her before.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.532
So have you.

14:41.576 --> 14:44.100
Her name is
Polly Kenner.

14:44.144 --> 14:47.712
Michael asked me to look into
her disappearance last month.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.150
I thought she'd run away.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.804
I was wrong.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.778
â™ª

15:13.782 --> 15:15.784
[water running]

15:38.459 --> 15:40.765
Hi. What are you
doing here?

15:40.809 --> 15:42.071
We have to talk.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.291
Okay. Come on in.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.778
I should begin
with an apology.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.259
For what? Not returning a text?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.392
No. I, um...
I'm here about the, uh...

15:58.435 --> 16:00.176
the case you asked me
to look into:

16:00.220 --> 16:01.482
the disappearance
of Polly Kenner.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.487
I should have paid it
closer attention.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.228
There's been a development.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.623
What's up?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.322
Too early to say
for certain,

16:15.365 --> 16:17.977
but I think
she might be dead.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.369
What?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.328
What do you mean, you think?

16:21.371 --> 16:24.461
A woman was murdered
two nights ago in Brooklyn.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.333
She, um...

16:26.376 --> 16:28.030
she was dressed in clothing

16:28.074 --> 16:30.119
taken from several
different missing women,

16:30.163 --> 16:32.121
including one known
murder victim.

16:32.165 --> 16:37.561
And the earrings that she
was wearing were Polly's.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.837
Do you have any idea who did it?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.491
No, not yet.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.668
As I said...
[clears throat] I'm, uh...

16:57.712 --> 17:00.497
sorry that I dismissed
your, uh... your earlier worries

17:00.541 --> 17:02.325
that something like this
might have happened.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.109
And I know it's late in coming,

17:04.153 --> 17:07.503
but this case has
my undivided attention now,

17:07.548 --> 17:10.071
and I will find
whoever's responsible.

17:10.116 --> 17:14.076
Can you just, um, keep me posted
on how it's going?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.991
Of course.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.950
You have my word.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.266
â™ª

17:33.356 --> 17:34.705
So?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.577
Yeah, he did it.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.666
Not a doubt in my mind.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.105
Sherlock was looking
for this woman last month.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.369
And the guy he thinks
killed her, he's a friend?

17:46.413 --> 17:49.111
No. Michael is someone he
just knows from the program.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.287
Well, this guy, he knows
Sherlock works for the police,

17:51.331 --> 17:53.202
'cause Sherlock talked
about it at meetings.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.552
He dangled this stuff
under Sherlock's nose,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.163
only Sherlock doesn't bite.

17:57.206 --> 18:00.253
So, the next time he strikes,
he does it closer to home.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.559
He murders
my daughter's roommate

18:02.603 --> 18:04.605
to make sure he's got
our attention.

18:04.648 --> 18:05.736
Is that about

18:05.780 --> 18:07.347
the long
and short of it?

18:07.390 --> 18:09.175
We think he must have dug
into Sherlock's life

18:09.218 --> 18:10.959
until he found someone
he was drawn to.

18:11.002 --> 18:14.397
Guy must be a hell of an actor
to fool your partner like that.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.095
We think he fooled
a lot of people,

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
including police
in three different states.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.403
The important thing now
is that we're onto him.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.276
If we want to lock this guy up,
we're gonna need a lot more.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.191
Asking a detective to look
into the disappearance

18:25.234 --> 18:26.975
of someone he claimed
was a friend

18:27.018 --> 18:28.150
doesn't prove anything.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.587
Probably makes him
look less guilty.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.241
Sherlock's at
home right now.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.374
He's calling everyone
he knows in the program.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.202
If Michael has spoken
to any of them,

18:36.245 --> 18:39.161
confessed any urges, we
might get some traction.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.815
Marcus in the loop yet?

18:40.858 --> 18:41.946
He's sifting through the files.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.470
He's trying to make connections.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.429
So far, this is all
we've got on Michael.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.475
[sighs]

18:50.651 --> 18:52.783
This guy drives a GTI?

18:52.827 --> 18:54.437
Yeah.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.830
Why?

18:55.873 --> 19:00.182
We got to talk to Hannah
right now.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.273
HANNAH:
That's the guy that hit my car.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.622
It was parked on the street

19:05.666 --> 19:07.363
in front of my place.
He clipped it.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.061
Hannah called me, asked me
if I had a repair guy I liked.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.238
She said the car
that hit hers was a GTI.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.978
Maddie saw him leaving

19:14.022 --> 19:15.284
a note on my windshield.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.721
She talked to him.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.506
You're sure?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.290
We exchanged
insurance information.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.336
He texted me the next day.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.948
Offered to pay for the repairs
out of pocket, and...

19:26.991 --> 19:28.732
and then he asked me out.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.038
He what?

19:30.081 --> 19:31.996
It was just supposed
to be coffee, but...

19:32.040 --> 19:34.651
that's where I was
when Maddie...

19:38.264 --> 19:40.179
I went to meet him.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.184
But he texted me, and he
told me he couldn't make it.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.099
That must have been
when he was at the house.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.365
Oh, you-you didn't know.

19:52.408 --> 19:55.846
I mean, sweetie,
you couldn't have known.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.327
What if I call him?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.286
Ask him for another date?
I could wear a wire,

20:00.329 --> 20:01.635
see if I can get him
to say anything.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.158
To tell you the truth, Hannah,

20:03.202 --> 20:05.247
we already have someone
who's close to him.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.248
Who?

20:06.292 --> 20:07.902
It's a long story,

20:07.945 --> 20:10.252
but keeping it
need-to-know for right now.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.037
And Joan is right.
We've already got our in.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.517
If we decide we need
something more,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.563
you'll be
the first to know.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.871
Can you excuse us
for a few minutes?

20:28.357 --> 20:31.621
[sighs]

20:31.665 --> 20:34.276
So, you think
Hannah's positive I.D.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.061
will get us a warrant
so we can look into Michael?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.541
Oh, it's enough to make me want

20:38.585 --> 20:40.674
to murder the guy,
but get a warrant?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.371
He shopped the Kenner case
to Sherlock,

20:42.415 --> 20:44.547
and then he started circling
Maddie and Hannah.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
He has a clean record,
a good job,

20:46.723 --> 20:48.682
no demonstrable
connection

20:48.725 --> 20:50.553
to the ten other open
cases out there.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.599
I'll try to find
a friendly judge,

20:52.642 --> 20:55.819
but I'm telling you right now,
we're gonna need more.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.217
WATSON:
You're decorating again?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.872
Wallpaper's a little better.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.528
So, none of our mutual
acquaintances in recovery

21:08.571 --> 21:11.095
had a harsh word
to say about Michael.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.662
So I sought out
his financials,

21:12.706 --> 21:15.099
as well as his cell phone
and Internet metadata,

21:15.143 --> 21:17.101
for the last ten years.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.887
I know for a fact that we
haven't gotten a warrant yet,

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
so where did that come from?

21:21.323 --> 21:23.325
Our hacker friends at Everyone.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.501
They may be
a loose coalition

21:25.545 --> 21:27.024
of basement-dwelling anarchists,
but they're

21:27.068 --> 21:28.374
no fans of serial killers.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.114
Would you like to know
what it cost?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.594
Oh, God.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.944
Do I have to shave
your head again?

21:33.988 --> 21:35.076
Nothing.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.078
They forewent my
ritual humiliation

21:37.121 --> 21:38.949
and provided this gratis.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.604
It was almost enough
to restore my faith in humanity.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.565
Give me the highlights.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.568
Michael was on
a business trip to Da Nang

21:48.611 --> 21:50.265
the same month
that Graham Jenkins

21:50.309 --> 21:52.833
received a letter of apology
from Vietnam.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.620
I see that you circled a lot of
his credit card activity here.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.406
Those transactions correspond
to dates and towns

22:00.449 --> 22:02.059
where women went missing.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.671
You know, I would feel
a lot more optimistic about this

22:04.714 --> 22:06.716
if you had not obtained
all of this illegally.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.850
Even if I hadn't,
matching his travel itinerary

22:09.893 --> 22:11.460
to the crimes
would not be enough.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
That's just
intellectual onanism--

22:13.506 --> 22:14.681
stroking our own
suspicions

22:14.724 --> 22:17.161
without actually
nailing him to the wall.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.467
And yet...

22:18.511 --> 22:21.078
We know the proof
we need exists.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.429
He keeps trophies
from his victims.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.041
WATSON: And I doubt he used
all of his stash

22:27.084 --> 22:29.260
to dress up Maddie Williams.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.740
If you could briefly set aside

22:30.784 --> 22:34.004
your objections
to extrajudicial searches,

22:34.048 --> 22:36.746
perhaps we can go find the rest.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.228
WATSON: You said that Michael
goes to the gym every night.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.797
It's been two hours, and his car
is still parked outside.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.106
Your headache's back?

22:49.150 --> 22:51.108
Mmm.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.241
Did you bring your
gabapentin with you?

22:53.284 --> 22:54.895
I did not.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.200
Okay. I'm gonna
take you home.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.506
We're gonna get some.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.029
No, Watson.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.901
No, this is a bad idea.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.119
You look like
you're dying.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.860
There isn't any
at home, either.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.732
Your scrip was
for 90 days.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.735
You threw it out.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.606
It was affecting my work.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.173
And your headaches aren't?

23:12.216 --> 23:13.740
Listen.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.611
This man...

23:15.655 --> 23:18.179
this man caught me
in a moment of weakness.

23:18.222 --> 23:21.356
And since then, I've sat
across tables from him.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.924
I've been
to meetings with him.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.014
He's been to our home.

23:27.057 --> 23:32.411
I am not going to let him
take another life.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.200
Fine. You want to see
this thing through?

23:39.243 --> 23:41.028
There's a pharmacy
around the corner.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.464
I'm going to go
fill your scrip.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.552
You're going back

23:43.596 --> 23:45.119
on gabapentin tonight.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.034
I'll be back in ten minutes.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.660
MICHAEL: I thought she
would never leave.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.501
[line ringing]

24:19.545 --> 24:22.112
HOLMES: I can't take
your call at the moment,

24:22.156 --> 24:23.984
so please leave a message.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.169
[monitor beeping]

24:45.048 --> 24:47.050
[groans]

24:48.138 --> 24:49.618
You're awake.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.751
What'd you do to me?

24:51.794 --> 24:53.796
I didn't do anything.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.146
So, why am I
in a hospital?

24:56.190 --> 24:58.366
You were in the car.
You lunged at me.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.629
You passed out.
You're in bad shape.

25:00.673 --> 25:01.978
You're better now.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.458
Take it easy.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.938
If you hurt Watson...

25:04.981 --> 25:07.201
She's fine.
I didn't even come up

25:07.244 --> 25:09.029
to the car
until she had walked away.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.987
She kept texting
you, so...

25:11.031 --> 25:13.468
I finally replied with one:

25:13.512 --> 25:17.167
"All is well.
Be in touch soon."

25:18.995 --> 25:21.563
So, I lost consciousness,
so you drove me here?

25:21.607 --> 25:24.435
Sherlock... you
have to believe me.

25:24.479 --> 25:29.571
When I asked you to look into
Polly Kenner, I meant it.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.052
I thought it would
do you good.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.706
And what about the dozen or so

25:33.749 --> 25:36.143
other women
that came before her?

25:36.186 --> 25:39.494
They for my benefit
as well, were they?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.627
No.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.672
They were for mine.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.634
You could say you
had a hand in it,

25:48.677 --> 25:53.073
but for a long time,
I've had these urges.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.509
Things that I knew
were wrong.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.989
Things that I
knew were bad.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.861
But it hurt not to do them.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.342
That's how I became
a heroin addict.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.042
And that was worse--
much worse.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.392
So I joined the program.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.612
The rest is like
I told you.

26:10.656 --> 26:14.094
One night I was at a meeting,
and I heard you share.

26:15.269 --> 26:19.012
And I began to focus on my work,

26:19.055 --> 26:22.668
use it to stay clean.

26:22.711 --> 26:25.584
I just never told you
what my work was.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
You know, it's funny.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.721
You may be the only person

26:32.765 --> 26:35.898
who can really understand
that...

26:35.942 --> 26:40.555
it's not the work that
motivates you to stay clean.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.601
Like, when you kick heroin,
you wonder

26:42.644 --> 26:45.038
if you'll ever have
that feeling again.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.736
You know,
that... itch

26:47.780 --> 26:50.739
that you can't
wait to scratch.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.524
That's what those women
were for me.

26:53.568 --> 26:56.615
That's what they gave me back.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.442
And it worked.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
For a while.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.012
Not anymore?

27:03.056 --> 27:06.233
Getting away with murder
is an incredible feeling.

27:07.887 --> 27:10.541
But it got easy.

27:10.585 --> 27:14.110
A few months back,
I began to want to use again,

27:14.154 --> 27:16.373
so I figured I needed
to up the stakes.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.680
So, is that where I come in?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.464
You actually called me.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.553
I had my hands full with Polly.

27:22.597 --> 27:25.382
You just popped
up on my phone,

27:25.426 --> 27:28.516
and it clicked.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.345
We could help each other.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.042
If you really want
to test yourself,

27:33.086 --> 27:35.349
why don't you tell me
where you disposed of her?

27:35.392 --> 27:37.960
We can see how well
you covered your tracks.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.354
No, you-you're
not getting it.

27:40.397 --> 27:45.533
This isn't about the work that
got me through in the past.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.711
I need this now, Sherlock.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.713
So do you.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
I mean, you've
been struggling,

27:53.759 --> 27:55.674
obviously, and I...
I know you've

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
been thinking
about using lately.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.898
We may be
completely different people,

28:02.942 --> 28:07.424
but we share one very big thing
in common.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.038
Please take care
of yourself.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.085
We need each other.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.705
[sighs]

28:28.097 --> 28:30.360
You should go lie down.
Try and sleep.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.580
I think I've been
unconscious enough for one day.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.582
You were abducted
by a serial killer.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.062
You're lucky to be alive.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.064
Actually, according to your
medical chart, you barely are.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.675
You'd be strapped to a hospital
bed in St. Bede's right now

28:40.719 --> 28:42.546
if I didn't know their head
of internal medicine.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.896
I understand that, but I...

28:43.939 --> 28:45.767
Your blood pressure
and heart rate are way up.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.551
Your cortisol levels
are awful.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.988
You're not just
suffering from PCS.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.772
This is clinical fatigue now.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.731
I told you what Michael said.He thinks
he's playing

28:52.774 --> 28:53.993
some kind of game with you.
I don't even

28:54.036 --> 28:55.516
know why you're engaging
with him.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.780
Listen, you're making
terrible decisions right now

28:58.824 --> 28:59.999
because you're not
thinking clearly.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.957
But I am, and I'm telling you--

29:02.001 --> 29:03.916
you have to get better
to be better.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.832
You're right about all that.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.051
But Michael didn't just tell me
why he was doing

29:09.095 --> 29:11.097
what he's doing.
He also said

29:11.140 --> 29:12.838
that I was on the phone with him

29:12.881 --> 29:15.231
when he had his hands full
with Polly Kenner.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.625
It was a slip.

29:17.668 --> 29:20.193
He's given us something
to work with.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.935
So help me finish this.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.242
[sighs]

29:26.286 --> 29:29.855
HOLMES:
And, finally, D3-A25,

29:29.898 --> 29:32.945
A6-1B6.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.300
Are you sure?

29:40.343 --> 29:41.954
Even in my present state,
I'm able

29:41.997 --> 29:44.957
to recognize my own phone number
and read out loud.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.307
Then this one's weird.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.397
It was the first call
between you and Michael?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.920
I don't recall the date,

29:51.964 --> 29:53.661
but unless his metadata's
been manipulated,

29:53.704 --> 29:55.445
that's correct.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.578
The cell tower
that connected you

29:57.621 --> 29:59.798
on Michael's end was
out in Willowbrook.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.974
Polly Kenner didn't work out
in Staten Island, did she?

30:02.017 --> 30:04.063
No. When I looked
into her disappearance,

30:04.106 --> 30:05.804
her entire existence
revolved around

30:05.847 --> 30:07.893
a ten-block area in Greenpoint.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.938
Then I guess this one
is probably not related.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.461
Again, he said he had

30:11.505 --> 30:13.724
his hands full
with Polly Kenner when I called.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.119
This is the only time we spoke

30:17.163 --> 30:19.992
when he wasn't
in a dense, urban area.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.472
What if he was in these woods,
burying her?

30:22.516 --> 30:24.126
One cell tower

30:24.170 --> 30:26.172
is not enough to triangulate
his precise position.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.782
I've been
in the man's office.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.959
I can tell you
that each of these calls

30:31.003 --> 30:32.526
is routed near a
construction project

30:32.569 --> 30:34.310
his firm is working on.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.139
You really think he'd pick
a spot he could be linked to?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.662
Where would you bury
a dead body?

30:38.706 --> 30:40.360
Somewhere you've never
been before

30:40.403 --> 30:42.841
or somewhere you knew
you wouldn't be disturbed?

30:44.407 --> 30:46.540
[construction equipment
buzzing and whirring]

30:52.198 --> 30:53.677
[dogs barking]Hey, can I help you, fellas?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.288
GREGSON:
You the boss here?

30:55.331 --> 30:57.029
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.205
Tell the guys to knock it off
with the saw.

30:59.248 --> 31:02.164
You're spooking the dogs.Hey, Terry.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.123
[buzzing and whirring stop,
dogs stop barking]

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
Listen, whatever
this is,

31:06.212 --> 31:07.561
my crew's a good bunch.

31:07.604 --> 31:08.910
I mean, I'm not sure
everybody's got

31:08.954 --> 31:10.085
their I's dotted
on their paperwork...

31:10.129 --> 31:12.044
This isn't anything like that.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.524
Why you got dogs on my job site?

31:14.568 --> 31:18.180
Your guys aren't the only people
who have access to this place.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.530
Or to these woods.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.576
Come on.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.673
BELL: Do me a favor.
Stick around, all right?

31:32.716 --> 31:35.850
Everything from here to the
expressway is in bounds.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.331
So go slow. Let's
take it east to west.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.941
[dog barking]WOMAN: Got something.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.205
That didn't take long.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.867
BELL:
You gotta be kidding me.

31:52.911 --> 31:57.306
I want this whole
area processed.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.744
He was here.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.053
They didn't find
any fingerprints?

32:05.097 --> 32:06.315
There weren't any.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.969
Whoever buried it
wiped it clean.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.841
And CSU didn't collect
any DNA samples?

32:10.885 --> 32:12.756
We took home
plenty of dirt.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.149
The lab's gonna run
some tests,

32:14.193 --> 32:15.759
but I'm not getting
my hopes up.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.066
You could see where the guy
raked up all his footprints.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.068
He was at the site
pretty recently,

32:20.112 --> 32:21.417
but I doubt
we'll ever know

32:21.461 --> 32:23.419
if Polly Kenner
was really buried there.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.943
Something spooked
those dogs.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.032
They're not trained to
react to lunch meat.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.903
HOLMES:
Could've been a dead animal.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.601
Or it was where he buried
all of the missing women.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.995
The point is we were invited
to that spot.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.257
Invited?

32:35.301 --> 32:36.693
The mannequin suggests
that his remark

32:36.737 --> 32:38.347
wasn't a slip
of the tongue after all,

32:38.391 --> 32:39.958
but he wanted us to find it.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.611
Why? Just to taunt you?

32:41.655 --> 32:44.266
Actually, I think it was meant
to encourage us.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.747
It's no fun for him
if there aren't bloodhounds--

32:46.790 --> 32:48.270
literal and figurative--

32:48.314 --> 32:49.402
on his trail.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.969
GREGSON:
So he got what he wanted.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.449
What do you think
he wants to do next?

32:53.493 --> 32:55.321
No idea.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.633
Where are you going?

33:03.677 --> 33:06.114
Going home. I'm spent.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.029
You should stay.
There's probably a dozen angles

33:08.073 --> 33:10.379
I can't think of right now
that should be considered.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.207
We'll pull traffic cam footage
near the construction site.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.643
Maybe we'll get a sense of where

33:13.687 --> 33:15.384
he was headed
when he moved the body.

33:15.428 --> 33:18.039
Well, if you find something, or
if the crime lab surprises us...

33:18.083 --> 33:19.171
I'll let you know.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.870
Uh, hold on. I'll find
someone to take you home.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.654
Oh, I'll be fine,
thank you very much.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.047
I'll get a taxi.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.876
I'll sleep well knowing
that you're on the case.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.884
[dance music playing]

33:39.104 --> 33:41.062
â™ª Uh

33:42.107 --> 33:43.586
â™ª Come on

33:46.546 --> 33:48.548
â™ª Uh

33:53.422 --> 33:55.424
â™ª Uh

33:56.730 --> 33:58.558
â™ª Come on...

34:09.134 --> 34:10.699
[grunts]

34:10.744 --> 34:12.746
It's been a while.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.617
Yeah.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.402
But I'm not here
to reminisce.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.967
Hmm.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.366
I heard you're working
for the police now.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.456
I consult.

34:27.500 --> 34:31.025
You work for them.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.114
[sighs]

34:33.158 --> 34:35.768
Fine. I'll-I'll go to Yevgeny.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.772
He doesn't change.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.687
[speaks Russian]

34:40.730 --> 34:44.168
You still don't have
sense of humor.

34:49.565 --> 34:52.264
That's all that $2,000 buys?

34:52.306 --> 34:54.962
It's all it buys you.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.747
You let me know if
you find someone

34:57.791 --> 35:02.274
willing to offer
a police discount for heroin.

35:05.277 --> 35:08.236
Don't be such a stranger.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.369
Come back and see us.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.327
Soon.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.038
â™ª

35:34.306 --> 35:36.395
[door opens]

35:36.438 --> 35:39.398
Crime lab finished processing
everything from the grave site.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.443
They got nothing.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.446
No animal remains?
Unidentified fibers?

35:44.490 --> 35:47.580
We knew he wiped the mannequin
down with rubbing alcohol.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.277
Now, soil analysis tells us

35:49.321 --> 35:51.671
he poured the stuff
over every inch of dirt

35:51.714 --> 35:54.282
that might have had
a clue buried in it.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.110
I was hoping the mass spec
would tell us

35:56.154 --> 35:57.198
something interesting about

35:57.242 --> 35:58.939
the paint he used
for these eyes.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.158
Off the shelf.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.029
Not color-matched.
Buy it anywhere.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.248
Where's your discard pile?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.163
That would be
the whole table.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.773
This case
is just different.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.949
The main reason he kills
is to get away with it,

36:08.992 --> 36:10.472
so premeditation
is the whole point.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.648
We're just gonna have
to watch and catch him when

36:12.692 --> 36:14.302
he's making his next move,
because this guy

36:14.346 --> 36:15.782
just does not leave
any evidence behind.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.566
Well, that's gonna be tough.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.613
Judge just denied our request
for an eavesdropping warrant

36:20.656 --> 36:22.745
and a video
surveillance warrant.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.486
What about everything
that Sherlock heard?

36:24.530 --> 36:26.706
Judge said she wouldn't consider
hearsay evidence

36:26.749 --> 36:28.316
because Sherlock
was hospitalized

36:28.360 --> 36:30.188
with neurological issues.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.017
The only bit of good news
I can tell you

36:34.061 --> 36:36.281
is Graham Jenkins
is gonna be released.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.631
I just talked to the
D.A. out in Trenton.

36:38.674 --> 36:41.024
They're filing paperwork
tomorrow.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.505
[phone chiming]

36:43.549 --> 36:45.681
[Watson sighs]GREGSON: Everything okay?

36:45.725 --> 36:47.335
I don't know.
It's Sherlock.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.684
I should go.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.773
Joan.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.471
Get some sleep yourself.

36:52.514 --> 36:53.820
Go.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.343
Okay.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.783
What's going on?

37:06.702 --> 37:08.791
Are you okay?

37:08.835 --> 37:10.924
I wouldn't say so, no.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.492
What is that?

37:13.535 --> 37:15.407
It's heroin.

37:16.669 --> 37:18.714
Bought some after I
left the precinct.

37:18.758 --> 37:23.371
I was going to tell you, but
I didn't think you'd approve.

37:23.415 --> 37:26.200
You can relax. It's not for me.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.376
It's for him.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.467
You're thinking
about dosing Michael.

37:32.511 --> 37:35.731
It is a rare advantage
to know a killer's mind.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.212
To know his greatest weakness.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.997
A little taste should do it.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.521
Do what?

37:42.564 --> 37:44.523
Unmoor him.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.569
He thinks he knows sobriety.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.529
What it takes to achieve
it, maintain it.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.227
He doesn't.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.924
He's played a
neat game so far,

37:54.968 --> 37:56.709
but this...

37:56.752 --> 37:59.407
this will knock him
off his stride.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.583
If you think
I'm not aware

38:01.627 --> 38:03.716
how repulsive my plan is--

38:03.759 --> 38:06.588
weaponizing heroin
to undo a fellow addict--

38:06.632 --> 38:09.199
I assure you, I am.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.551
But I feel I have little choice.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.600
He would taste it
in most liquids.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.776
We could maybe mix it
with some condiments...

38:20.820 --> 38:22.822
No, I'm not asking
you to help.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.606
You've taken
the Hippocratic oath.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.129
I know that.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.436
I also know that he's
murdered 14 women

38:28.480 --> 38:30.133
and we can't prove it.

38:30.177 --> 38:33.702
So, if this is what
we have to do to stop him,

38:33.746 --> 38:36.401
I'm fine with it.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.451
HOLMES:
He's not home.

38:43.495 --> 38:44.974
You hope.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.499
We've sent two different
messengers to his door.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.631
How much more certain
we gonna be if we send a third?

38:49.675 --> 38:51.894
I'm gonna go in the back.No, no. I will.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.809
Even half asleep,
I'm twice as fast

38:53.853 --> 38:55.463
with a dead bolt
as you are.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.378
Yeah, but I'm the one
with 20 grams of heroin

38:57.422 --> 38:59.206
in my purse, so... if
you think I'm gonna

38:59.249 --> 39:00.686
leave that with you,
you can think again.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.383
You be the lookout.

39:02.427 --> 39:05.778
And, you know, try and
look out this time.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.582
[phone ringing]

39:33.240 --> 39:34.415
Hello?

39:34.459 --> 39:35.982
MICHAEL:
You can tell your partner

39:36.025 --> 39:38.419
she can waste as much time
in there as she wants,

39:38.463 --> 39:40.290
but she's not going to find
anything.

39:40.334 --> 39:43.206
I've already left New York.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.823
HOLMES:
Where are you?

39:50.866 --> 39:52.564
MICHAEL:
Come on.

39:52.607 --> 39:55.567
I wouldn't be doing
either of us any favors

39:55.610 --> 39:57.395
if I made life that easy.

40:03.966 --> 40:07.187
HOLMES: You've got a very
wrongheaded conception of what

40:07.230 --> 40:08.971
constitutes a favor.

40:09.015 --> 40:12.192
But that's okay,
'cause I'll find you anywhere.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.063
It's funny.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.326
You sound better already.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.893
You're not fooling me.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.591
Oh, no?

40:19.634 --> 40:23.682
Yeah, I saw you in that
hospital bed the other night.

40:23.725 --> 40:26.119
I know the truth.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.642
You need time.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.210
And as it turns out,
I can give it to you.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.691
In fact, I am giving it to you.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.433
So, what does that mean?

40:35.476 --> 40:38.523
That means these past few days

40:38.566 --> 40:41.526
have been exactly
what I hoped for.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.485
I-I feel like myself again.

40:46.008 --> 40:49.447
So I'm going to go away
for a while, but...

40:49.490 --> 40:51.579
I'll be back.

40:51.623 --> 40:55.583
I want to give you time
to get better.

40:55.627 --> 41:01.371
But while I'm away, you have
my word I won't hurt anyone.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.505
'Cause your word means
so much to me.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.465
I'm your friend, Sherlock.

41:07.508 --> 41:10.163
I'll never lie to you.

41:12.861 --> 41:15.298
You're going to die in prison.

41:15.342 --> 41:19.433
â™ª Forgive me, Father,
for I have seen â™ª

41:19.477 --> 41:23.002
â™ª So much pain and suffering

41:23.045 --> 41:26.179
â™ª Is there any hope for me?

41:26.222 --> 41:28.181
â™ª Oh...â™ª

41:28.224 --> 41:29.748
My car's here.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.533
You have refills
for all your medications?

41:32.577 --> 41:34.317
They have pharmacies
in Vermont.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.320
I'm sorry.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.671
Leaving you to deal
with this on your own.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.934
Taking a break
from everything is smart.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.457
It's what your doctor wanted.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.285
Besides, we have
no shortage of people

41:45.328 --> 41:46.808
looking into Michael now.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.984
Every move he made.
We'll close this.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.465
You'll be back soon enough.
You'll be better.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.642
Don't make a habit of that
while I'm gone.

41:54.686 --> 41:55.948
What?

41:55.991 --> 41:57.819
Wishful thinking.

41:58.994 --> 42:00.822
Call me when you get there.

42:00.866 --> 42:03.303
â™ª Walking in the daylight
