They're interfering with

00:05.440 --> 00:09.009
my focus, my sleep,
my existence.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.706
You have to ask yourself--
do you want to get by,

00:10.749 --> 00:13.317
or do you want to get better?
If you want to get by,

00:13.361 --> 00:14.884
we can try some different
medications,

to get better,

00:16.625 --> 00:19.019

is a very long vacation.

to see me last night.

She told me she's an alcoholic.

They were gonna come down
next month for her birthday.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.808
GREGSON:
It's all right.

01:09.852 --> 01:12.072
We got people
notifying the family.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.334
Can you think of anybody

01:13.377 --> 01:14.857
that would've wanted
to hurt Maddie?

01:14.900 --> 01:16.337
She was a
third-grade teacher

01:16.380 --> 01:18.861

person I ever met.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.342

Uh, her boyfriend
moved to Argentina

01:22.734 --> 01:24.562

She took it pretty hard.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.087
I don't think she'd even been
on a date since he left.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.914
This doesn't make sense.

to describe it.

Yeah.

I was, but I came back.

they're out of fashion.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.761
Jewelry is mismatched, too.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.632
You think the killer
dressed her.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.112
We can check with Hannah,

02:36.156 --> 02:38.070
but I've been inside
this woman's closet,

02:38.114 --> 02:41.291
and I don't think anything
she's wearing belonged to her.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.207
If the killer
brought the outfit,

02:44.251 --> 02:45.382
what's the significance?

02:45.426 --> 02:46.644
It's not overtly sexual

02:46.688 --> 02:48.168
or flattering.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.213
I don't think he dressed her
for himself.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.433
I think he dressed her for us.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.739
There's dried blood
on these pants.

were forced through postmortem.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.239
She didn't have pierced ears.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
No, but the killer
was determined

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
to get the earrings on.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.767
He wouldn't settle
for an incomplete picture.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.509
She's not been dressed;
she's been decorated.

03:25.553 --> 03:28.033
And every ornament matters.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.513
You think everything
she's wearing

My lawyer does.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.985
He tried to get me a new trial,

09:55.029 --> 09:56.987
but they said
it's not proof of anything.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.337
They said I need proof.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.601
Then we'll find some.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.604
WOMAN: They're ours.
No question about it.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.345
They're also really tiny.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.651
I can't believe
you tracked these

10:08.695 --> 10:10.174
all the way back to my store.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.480
Yeah, it wasn't easy.

10:11.523 --> 10:12.829
We're hoping it'll be worth it.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.178
We want to identify everyone

10:14.222 --> 10:16.528
who ever bought a pair of those.

10:16.572 --> 10:20.010
You said you're
investigating a homicide?

10:20.054 --> 10:23.100
Is it the serial killer thing
I saw on the news?

10:23.144 --> 10:25.668
Did these belong to
someone he killed?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
All we can say at the moment

10:27.365 --> 10:29.193
is that the case
is very important.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.108
That's why we want everything
you've got

10:31.152 --> 10:33.110
on your customers,
all your sales records.

10:33.154 --> 10:37.854
Yeah, I-I wish I could help,
but we're pretty Stone Age here.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.683
This is, like, my
personal computer.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.685
We don't have a great
inventory system

10:42.729 --> 10:45.122
or a way to track
repeat customers or anything.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.124
You do take
credit cards, though.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.560
Those records might have

10:48.604 --> 10:50.693
the kind of information
we're looking for.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.174
You're welcome
to everything we've got.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.481
But a lot of our sales
are cash, and...

10:56.525 --> 10:59.180
those...

10:59.223 --> 11:01.878
they're a mess.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.663
On the plus side, I've
only got two employees.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.229
You should talk to them.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
They both worked here
when we sold those earrings.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.580
They might remember something.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.843
Here.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.235
They might remember
all the people

11:11.279 --> 11:12.846
who ever bought these earrings?

11:12.889 --> 11:15.979
Well, we only sold like
six pair, and they went quick.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.982
I got them from this really cool
designer up in Albany.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.680
We got them in...

11:20.723 --> 11:22.551
it was last Thanksgiving.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.553
I remember because
I wanted the designer

11:24.596 --> 11:26.511
to make more
for the holiday rush,

11:26.555 --> 11:27.817
but she was too busy.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.166
I don't suppose you still have

11:29.210 --> 11:30.820
the security footage
from back then?

11:30.864 --> 11:33.040
I don't have anything
from last week.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.695
We reuse the tapes
to save money.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.392
Sorry.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.527
You've been busy.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.529
Decorating. Not deducing.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.183
I had hoped
that one of these

11:46.227 --> 11:47.707
mundane horror stories
would provide a handhold,

11:47.750 --> 11:48.925
but so far
all I've encountered

11:48.969 --> 11:51.014
is subpar paperwork.

11:51.058 --> 11:54.061
There's been one
promising oddity.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.892
WATSON:
"You were never meant
to take the fall.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.632
Sorry about that."

12:00.676 --> 12:02.373
Graham Jenkins
received it in prison.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.724
He believes it's from the man
who killed his wife.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.595
Of course, it
wasn't signed,

12:06.638 --> 12:08.292
and it was
so woefully mishandled

12:08.336 --> 12:10.599
that there's no chance
of forensic analysis

12:10.642 --> 12:12.253
revealing the author's identity.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.733
If it is genuine,

12:13.776 --> 12:15.256
if the killer did send it,

12:15.299 --> 12:17.606
it was likely
to torment Mr. Jenkins.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.087
What intrigued me
was the postmark.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.393
WATSON:
It was sent from Vietnam.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.569
There's nothing here to suggest
a South Asian connection,

12:24.613 --> 12:26.310
but I could be
just missing it.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.922
Do you have any better
reason for optimism?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.619
Not really.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.273
The belt that Maddie was wearing

12:32.316 --> 12:34.536
came from a homeless woman
in Hoboken.

12:34.579 --> 12:38.409
So far, his victim profile
includes prostitutes, teachers,

12:38.453 --> 12:39.715
addicts, college students.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.456
This man
does not discriminate.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.980
It suggests that killing
is more about sport

12:44.024 --> 12:46.853
than it is a rage
against a certain type.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.985
There wasn't even
an open police file on this.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.726
Just some
social worker's report.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.293
Probably a dead end.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.077
Any progress with
the earrings?

12:54.121 --> 12:57.211
Um, they came from
a little shop in Williamsburg.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.083
The owner wasn't much help,
but I pulled security footage

13:00.127 --> 13:03.086
from a bank down the block
that had exterior cameras.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.785
It's a long shot,
but if the earrings

13:05.828 --> 13:08.744
were not a gift,
and if she walked past the bank,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.660
we may be able to use
facial recognition software

13:11.703 --> 13:14.619
to run the footage
against missing persons cases.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.752
So we could end up
with another thin file

13:16.796 --> 13:20.234
of stale police work to
pointlessly put on my walls.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.236
There has got to be
a pattern here somewhere.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.152
I just don't know if we're
going to find it tonight.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.895
When's the last time you slept?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.940
Night before last.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.507
And that headache
you've been fighting?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.422
That's worse.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.293
Unrelated, I'm sure.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.121
I'll rest when
I find this man.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.689
I want to find him, too,
but we have to pace ourselves.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.604
I'll retire to my sensory
deprivation chamber

13:42.647 --> 13:44.171
for one hour-- that's it.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
I'll go through the footage.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.175
If anything jumps out,
I'll come and get you.

you came up here to scrub
through security footage

14:24.298 --> 14:26.648
The woman who bought
the earrings.

WATSON: I don't see a bag
from the jewelry store.

14:32.610 --> 14:36.179
It must be in her purse or
her pocket, because that's her.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.833
How can you be sure?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.966
Because I've
seen her before.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.532
So have you.

Her name is

Okay. Come on in.

Too early to say

What?

What do you mean, you think?

A woman was murdered
two nights ago in Brooklyn.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.333
She, um...

16:26.376 --> 16:28.030

Sherlock was looking

She said the car
that hit hers was a GTI.

Oh, it's enough to make me want

20:38.585 --> 20:40.674
to murder the guy,
but get a warrant?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.371
He shopped the Kenner case
to Sherlock,

20:42.415 --> 20:44.547
and then he started circling
Maddie and Hannah.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
He has a clean record,
a good job,

20:46.723 --> 20:48.682
no demonstrable
connection

20:48.725 --> 20:50.553
to the ten other open
cases out there.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.599
I'll try to find
a friendly judge,

20:52.642 --> 20:55.819
but I'm telling you right now,
we're gonna need more.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.217
WATSON:
You're decorating again?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.872
Wallpaper's a little better.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.528
So, none of our mutual
acquaintances in recovery

21:08.571 --> 21:11.095
had a harsh word
to say about Michael.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.662
So I sought out
his financials,

21:12.706 --> 21:15.099
as well as his cell phone
and Internet metadata,

21:15.143 --> 21:17.101
for the last ten years.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.887
I know for a fact that we
haven't gotten a warrant yet,

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
so where did that come from?

21:21.323 --> 21:23.325
Our hacker friends at Everyone.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.501
They may be
a loose coalition

21:25.545 --> 21:27.024
of basement-dwelling anarchists,
but they're

21:27.068 --> 21:28.374
no fans of serial killers.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.114
Would you like to know
what it cost?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.594
Oh, God.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.944
Do I have to shave
your head again?

21:33.988 --> 21:35.076
Nothing.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.078
They forewent my
ritual humiliation

21:37.121 --> 21:38.949
and provided this gratis.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.604
It was almost enough
to restore my faith in humanity.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.565
Give me the highlights.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.568
Michael was on
a business trip to Da Nang

21:48.611 --> 21:50.265
the same month
that Graham Jenkins

21:50.309 --> 21:52.833
received a letter of apology
from Vietnam.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.620
I see that you circled a lot of
his credit card activity here.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.406
Those transactions correspond
to dates and towns

22:00.449 --> 22:02.059
where women went missing.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.671
You know, I would feel
a lot more optimistic about this

22:04.714 --> 22:06.716
if you had not obtained
all of this illegally.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.850
Even if I hadn't,
matching his travel itinerary

22:09.893 --> 22:11.460
to the crimes
would not be enough.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
That's just
intellectual onanism--

22:13.506 --> 22:14.681
stroking our own
suspicions

22:14.724 --> 22:17.161
without actually
nailing him to the wall.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.467
And yet...

22:18.511 --> 22:21.078
We know the proof
we need exists.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.429
He keeps trophies
from his victims.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.041
WATSON: And I doubt he used
all of his stash

22:27.084 --> 22:29.260
to dress up Maddie Williams.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.740
If you could briefly set aside

22:30.784 --> 22:34.004
your objections
to extrajudicial searches,

22:34.048 --> 22:36.746
perhaps we can go find the rest.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.228
WATSON: You said that Michael
goes to the gym every night.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.797
It's been two hours, and his car
is still parked outside.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.106
Your headache's back?

22:49.150 --> 22:51.108
Mmm.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.241
Did you bring your
gabapentin with you?

22:53.284 --> 22:54.895
I did not.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.200
Okay. I'm gonna
take you home.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.506
We're gonna get some.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.029
No, Watson.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.901
No, this is a bad idea.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.119
You look like
you're dying.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.860
There isn't any
at home, either.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.732
Your scrip was
for 90 days.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.735
You threw it out.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.606
It was affecting my work.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.173
And your headaches aren't?

23:12.216 --> 23:13.740
Listen.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.611
This man...

23:15.655 --> 23:18.179
this man caught me
in a moment of weakness.

23:18.222 --> 23:21.356
And since then, I've sat
across tables from him.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.924
I've been
to meetings with him.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.014
He's been to our home.

23:27.057 --> 23:32.411
I am not going to let him
take another life.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.200
Fine. You want to see
this thing through?

23:39.243 --> 23:41.028
There's a pharmacy
around the corner.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.464
I'm going to go
fill your scrip.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.552
You're going back

23:43.596 --> 23:45.119
on gabapentin tonight.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.034
I'll be back in ten minutes.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.660
MICHAEL: I thought she
would never leave.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.501
[line ringing]

24:19.545 --> 24:22.112
HOLMES: I can't take
your call at the moment,

24:22.156 --> 24:23.984
so please leave a message.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.169
[monitor beeping]

24:45.048 --> 24:47.050
[groans]

24:48.138 --> 24:49.618
You're awake.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.751
What'd you do to me?

24:51.794 --> 24:53.796
I didn't do anything.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.146
So, why am I
in a hospital?

24:56.190 --> 24:58.366
You were in the car.
You lunged at me.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.629
You passed out.
You're in bad shape.

25:00.673 --> 25:01.978
You're better now.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.458
Take it easy.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.938
If you hurt Watson...

25:04.981 --> 25:07.201
She's fine.
I didn't even come up

25:07.244 --> 25:09.029
to the car
until she had walked away.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.987
She kept texting
you, so...

25:11.031 --> 25:13.468
I finally replied with one:

25:13.512 --> 25:17.167
"All is well.
Be in touch soon."

25:18.995 --> 25:21.563
So, I lost consciousness,
so you drove me here?

25:21.607 --> 25:24.435
Sherlock... you
have to believe me.

25:24.479 --> 25:29.571
When I asked you to look into
Polly Kenner, I meant it.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.052
I thought it would
do you good.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.706
And what about the dozen or so

25:33.749 --> 25:36.143
other women
that came before her?

25:36.186 --> 25:39.494
They for my benefit
as well, were they?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.627
No.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.672
They were for mine.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.634
You could say you
had a hand in it,

25:48.677 --> 25:53.073
but for a long time,
I've had these urges.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.509
Things that I knew
were wrong.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.989
Things that I
knew were bad.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.861
But it hurt not to do them.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.342
That's how I became
a heroin addict.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.042
And that was worse--
much worse.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.392
So I joined the program.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.612
The rest is like
I told you.

26:10.656 --> 26:14.094
One night I was at a meeting,
and I heard you share.

26:15.269 --> 26:19.012
And I began to focus on my work,

26:19.055 --> 26:22.668
use it to stay clean.

26:22.711 --> 26:25.584
I just never told you
what my work was.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
You know, it's funny.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.721
You may be the only person

26:32.765 --> 26:35.898
who can really understand
that...

26:35.942 --> 26:40.555
it's not the work that
motivates you to stay clean.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.601
Like, when you kick heroin,
you wonder

26:42.644 --> 26:45.038
if you'll ever have
that feeling again.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.736
You know,
that... itch

26:47.780 --> 26:50.739
that you can't
wait to scratch.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.524
That's what those women
were for me.

26:53.568 --> 26:56.615
That's what they gave me back.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.442
And it worked.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
For a while.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.012
Not anymore?

27:03.056 --> 27:06.233
Getting away with murder
is an incredible feeling.

27:07.887 --> 27:10.541
But it got easy.

27:10.585 --> 27:14.110
A few months back,
I began to want to use again,

27:14.154 --> 27:16.373
so I figured I needed
to up the stakes.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.680
So, is that where I come in?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.464
You actually called me.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.553
I had my hands full with Polly.

27:22.597 --> 27:25.382
You just popped
up on my phone,

27:25.426 --> 27:28.516
and it clicked.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.345
We could help each other.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.042
If you really want
to test yourself,

27:33.086 --> 27:35.349
why don't you tell me
where you disposed of her?

27:35.392 --> 27:37.960
We can see how well
you covered your tracks.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.354
No, you-you're
not getting it.

27:40.397 --> 27:45.533
This isn't about the work that
got me through in the past.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.711
I need this now, Sherlock.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.713
So do you.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
I mean, you've
been struggling,

27:53.759 --> 27:55.674
obviously, and I...
I know you've

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
been thinking
about using lately.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.898
We may be
completely different people,

28:02.942 --> 28:07.424
but we share one very big thing
in common.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.038
Please take care
of yourself.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.085
We need each other.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.705
[sighs]

28:28.097 --> 28:30.360
You should go lie down.
Try and sleep.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.580
I think I've been
unconscious enough for one day.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.582
You were abducted
by a serial killer.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.062
You're lucky to be alive.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.064
Actually, according to your
medical chart, you barely are.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.675
You'd be strapped to a hospital
bed in St. Bede's right now

28:40.719 --> 28:42.546
if I didn't know their head
of internal medicine.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.896
I understand that, but I...

28:43.939 --> 28:45.767
Your blood pressure
and heart rate are way up.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.551
Your cortisol levels
are awful.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.988
You're not just
suffering from PCS.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.772
This is clinical fatigue now.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.731
I told you what Michael said.He thinks
he's playing

28:52.774 --> 28:53.993
some kind of game with you.
I don't even

28:54.036 --> 28:55.516
know why you're engaging
with him.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.780
Listen, you're making
terrible decisions right now

28:58.824 --> 28:59.999
because you're not
thinking clearly.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.957
But I am, and I'm telling you--

29:02.001 --> 29:03.916
you have to get better
to be better.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.832
You're right about all that.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.051
But Michael didn't just tell me
why he was doing

29:09.095 --> 29:11.097
what he's doing.
He also said

29:11.140 --> 29:12.838
that I was on the phone with him

29:12.881 --> 29:15.231
when he had his hands full
with Polly Kenner.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.625
It was a slip.

29:17.668 --> 29:20.193
He's given us something
to work with.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.935
So help me finish this.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.242
[sighs]

29:26.286 --> 29:29.855
HOLMES:
And, finally, D3-A25,

29:29.898 --> 29:32.945
A6-1B6.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.300
Are you sure?

29:40.343 --> 29:41.954
Even in my present state,
I'm able

29:41.997 --> 29:44.957
to recognize my own phone number
and read out loud.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.307
Then this one's weird.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.397
It was the first call
between you and Michael?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.920
I don't recall the date,

29:51.964 --> 29:53.661
but unless his metadata's
been manipulated,

29:53.704 --> 29:55.445
that's correct.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.578
The cell tower
that connected you

29:57.621 --> 29:59.798
on Michael's end was
out in Willowbrook.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.974
Polly Kenner didn't work out
in Staten Island, did she?

30:02.017 --> 30:04.063
No. When I looked
into her disappearance,

30:04.106 --> 30:05.804
her entire existence
revolved around

30:05.847 --> 30:07.893
a ten-block area in Greenpoint.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.938
Then I guess this one
is probably not related.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.461
Again, he said he had

30:11.505 --> 30:13.724
his hands full
with Polly Kenner when I called.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.119
This is the only time we spoke

30:17.163 --> 30:19.992
when he wasn't
in a dense, urban area.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.472
What if he was in these woods,
burying her?

30:22.516 --> 30:24.126
One cell tower

30:24.170 --> 30:26.172
is not enough to triangulate
his precise position.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.782
I've been
in the man's office.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.959
I can tell you
that each of these calls

30:31.003 --> 30:32.526
is routed near a
construction project

30:32.569 --> 30:34.310
his firm is working on.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.139
You really think he'd pick
a spot he could be linked to?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.662
Where would you bury
a dead body?

30:38.706 --> 30:40.360
Somewhere you've never
been before

30:40.403 --> 30:42.841
or somewhere you knew
you wouldn't be disturbed?

30:44.407 --> 30:46.540
[construction equipment
buzzing and whirring]

30:52.198 --> 30:53.677
[dogs barking]Hey, can I help you, fellas?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.288
GREGSON:
You the boss here?

30:55.331 --> 30:57.029
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.205
Tell the guys to knock it off
with the saw.

30:59.248 --> 31:02.164
You're spooking the dogs.Hey, Terry.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.123
[buzzing and whirring stop,
dogs stop barking]

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
Listen, whatever
this is,

31:06.212 --> 31:07.561
my crew's a good bunch.

31:07.604 --> 31:08.910
I mean, I'm not sure
everybody's got

31:08.954 --> 31:10.085
their I's dotted
on their paperwork...

31:10.129 --> 31:12.044
This isn't anything like that.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.524
Why you got dogs on my job site?

31:14.568 --> 31:18.180
Your guys aren't the only people
who have access to this place.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.530
Or to these woods.
