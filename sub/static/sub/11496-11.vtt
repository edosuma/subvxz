00:01.534 --> 00:04.236
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:04.238 --> 00:06.772
We got to go.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.974
We just got here.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.410
Yeah, I know, but I got to go.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.213
The sit-down "go."

00:14.215 --> 00:16.682
No, I am... I am tired
of being a slave

00:16.684 --> 00:18.417
To your fear
of public bathrooms.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.052
Do you know what people do
in there?

00:20.054 --> 00:22.221
They go to the bathroom.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.057
Exactly. It's-it's not the seat
as much as...

00:25.059 --> 00:27.393
(whispers):
The splash.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.595
You have ruined a lot of things
that I enjoy,

00:29.597 --> 00:31.930
And I am not gonna let you
take pooping from me.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.800
Oh, fine, but every time
you use a public bathroom,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.101
You are putting your ass

00:36.103 --> 00:38.504
Against every other ass
that has ever been there.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.105
See this guy?

00:40.107 --> 00:42.541
I might as well rub
my naked butt all over his.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.646
And he took pooping from me.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.149
Excuse me. Walden?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.316
Yes?

00:51.318 --> 00:53.252
I-I'm sure
you don't remember me,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.087
But I used to work for you.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.356
Sorry, I don't
remember your name.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.325
It's nicole, but you'd always
call me michelle.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.694
Right! Michelle!

01:02.696 --> 01:03.896
Yeah.
Hey.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.397
How you doing?
I-I haven't seen you

01:05.399 --> 01:06.698
Around the office in a while.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.535
Yeah, I stopped going in
after you fired me.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.570
Oh. Wow.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.205
That is...

01:13.207 --> 01:15.507
Are you here to kill me?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.377
I'm actually trying to get
a tech start-up off the ground.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.445
Or as my mom calls it,

01:19.447 --> 01:21.747
Wasting 20 hours a day
in the garage

01:21.749 --> 01:23.849
And not giving her grandkids.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.784
Let me guess:
You're looking for help.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.219
With the company,

01:27.221 --> 01:29.054
Not the grandkids.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.122
I mean, not that

01:30.124 --> 01:32.091
I wouldn't want to...
With you...

01:33.426 --> 01:35.694
Can you talk now?

01:35.696 --> 01:39.131
I  <i>am</i>looking for help...
With the company.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.567
I'll let you know
about the grandkids.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.268
Well, I would love
to hear about it.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.604
Why don't you call my office,
and we'll set something up?

01:45.606 --> 01:48.674
Yeah, when I worked for you,
I was kind of in charge

01:48.676 --> 01:51.577
Of blowing off the people
you told to "call your office."

01:51.579 --> 01:52.945
So you get it.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.947
(laughs)

01:54.949 --> 01:57.049
Look, 15 years ago,

01:57.051 --> 01:59.451
You cornered bill gates
in a steam room,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.887
And you pitched him the idea
for blungogo.Com,

02:01.889 --> 02:04.456
And six months later,
you were a billionaire.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.991
Yeah, what you don't know is

02:05.993 --> 02:07.993
That I also got tased
in the nuts

02:07.995 --> 02:09.795
By a security guard named randy.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.465
Look, I think
I have a really good idea.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.268
Everything you need
to know is right in here.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.139
Okay. I'll take a look at it.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.473
Thank you.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.877
I didn't even have to get
tased in the lady nuts.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.411
I still might tase you later.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.080
(laughs)

02:28.082 --> 02:29.248
Oh, it's not weird.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.582
We-we know each other.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.384
I fired her.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.752
I couldn't do it.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.521
We got to go. Now. Now!

02:35.523 --> 02:36.421
What?

02:36.423 --> 02:37.923
This is not a drill!

02:37.925 --> 02:39.992
Code brown!
Code brown!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.666
I wonder if I could train him
to go in the yard.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.102
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

02:50.104 --> 02:54.773
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.810
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

02:58.812 --> 03:01.113
(panting)

03:01.115 --> 03:02.414
Wow.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.550
Oh.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.518
Yeah, that was fun.
(sighs)

03:06.520 --> 03:07.786
Two thumbs up.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.321
Felt like more than that.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.826
Hey, uh, thanks
for letting me stay over.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.361
Thanks for letting
me stay under.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.264
Mmm.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.465
You know, I've been thinking--

03:20.467 --> 03:22.434
We've been doing this
for a couple of weeks,

03:22.436 --> 03:24.169
And I don't know
that much about you.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.171
Well, you know all
the important things.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.607
My favorite color's pink,
my favorite singer is pink,

03:28.609 --> 03:29.841
My favorite
body part is...

03:29.843 --> 03:31.977
Okay, fine.
If you don't want to talk,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.312
We don't have to talk.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.546
No, I'm kidding.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.348
Come on, ask me anything.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.317
Tell me about your family.
What's your mom like?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.686
Well, she's very,
very pretty.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.120
Mm-hmm.
Not too bright.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.456
Her boyfriend went
to harvard law school,

03:44.458 --> 03:47.159
And then broke up with her,
because he wanted a jackie,

03:47.161 --> 03:49.127
And she was more
of a marilyn,

03:49.129 --> 03:52.397
So she decided to
study real hard...

03:52.399 --> 03:53.599
Hold on a second.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.200
That's the plot
to   <i>legally blonde.</i>

03:55.202 --> 03:58.270
You saw that, huh?

03:58.272 --> 04:02.307
Uh, all right, I'll-I'll...
I'll tell you the truth.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.977
My mom is a
beautiful prostitute.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.912
Oh.
And my dad,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.046
Richard gere...

04:08.048 --> 04:10.582
You're unbelievable.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.552
Cut me some slack!

04:13.554 --> 04:16.521
I grew up in a town
that didn't allow dancing!

04:16.523 --> 04:19.591
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:19.593 --> 04:21.193
Mm. Good morning.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.362
Actually, it's a great morning.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.897
Somebody gave me
a billion-dollar idea.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.366
Oh, you got my e-mail.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.536
You know, with my idea.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.639
The app that helps you find
a clean public restroom

04:33.641 --> 04:34.873
Anywhere in the world.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.610
I called it "crapster."

04:38.612 --> 04:41.146
Yeah, as good of an idea
as that is,

04:41.148 --> 04:43.315
And actually, it's not that bad,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.951
I'm talking
about thought-recognition.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.287
Thought-control computing.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.921
Imagine you want to send a text,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.057
But, uh, you don't want
to take your phone out.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.259
Or imagine you want
to change the channel on the tv,

04:54.261 --> 04:55.427
But you don't have a remote.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.895
Imagine
you're in a strange city,

04:56.897 --> 04:58.463
And you can't find
a clean bathroom.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.233
Imagine you're in Italy,

05:01.235 --> 05:03.669
And you have to "arriva-doody."

05:03.671 --> 05:06.305
You know what?

05:07.206 --> 05:08.774
Here is a hundred dollars.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.609
I just bought your idea.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.711
Now, stop talking about it.

05:12.713 --> 05:17.683
Deal. Looks like I am getting
that filling after all.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.818
Morning.
Good morning.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.253
Oh, hey, morning.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.754
What are you guys up to today?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.856
I don't know.
Maybe we'll go to a bar

05:24.858 --> 05:26.124
And let guys buy us drinks

05:26.126 --> 05:28.060
If we're willing
to make out with each other.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.394
Allan:
Wait.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.562
Is-is that a thing?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.631
You and I should run that scam
with girls.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.402
Hey, I've got an idea.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.037
Let's go for a hike
in the canyon.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.340
I'd rather stay home
and yodel in your canyon.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.510
â™ª yodel-ay-hee hoo-ha!

05:47.980 --> 05:50.349
Come on, let's get
some fresh air, hang out.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.550
Just the two of us.

05:51.552 --> 05:55.087
Uh, yeah. Yeah, why not?
Sounds great.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.755
(clears her throat)
do you guys want to join us?

05:57.557 --> 05:58.890
Sure.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.393
You can never have
too much wood in the forest.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.828
I can't. I'm busy.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.296
Always busy.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.898
I can't remember the last time
this one took me anywhere.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.868
Hey, uh, jenny,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.036
Here's a hundred dollars.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.270
Lose him in the forest.

06:14.907 --> 06:18.009
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:18.011 --> 06:19.077
Yes?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.979
Yeah, I'm looking for nicole.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.014
Are you my new dad?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.549
Excuse me?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.385
It's a joke.
Try to keep up.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.686
Who are you?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.488
I'm walden schmidt.

06:29.490 --> 06:33.258
Holy schmidt!

06:37.163 --> 06:38.597
Oh, my god.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.799
Mr. Schmidt,
it is such an honor to meet you.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.100
I have a poster of you.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.502
A poster?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.770
Yeah, yeah, check it out.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.538
I made it in college.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.775
Walden:
Wow. It's, uh...

06:49.777 --> 06:51.943
Wow.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.146
I cut and pasted laura dern's
hair onto your face.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.680
It's pretty breathtaking, right?

06:55.682 --> 06:58.650
I'm sorry... Uh, who are you?

06:58.652 --> 06:59.918
Oh, uh, I-I'm barry.
Barry foster.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.654
But you can call me "bf,"
as in your biggest fan.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.989
(laughs)

07:03.991 --> 07:05.123
Walden!

07:05.125 --> 07:07.125
Nicole, hi.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.627
I read your proposal.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.495
I'm interested.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.763
Really?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.965
This is amazing.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.200
This is amazing.
(laughing)

07:15.202 --> 07:17.068
Oh, my fan fiction's come true.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.703
Nicole:
Barry,

07:18.705 --> 07:19.771
We talked about this.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.840
Right, right.
Boundaries.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.977
All right, here's-here's
what I'm prepared to do.

07:25.979 --> 07:30.115
In return for 51%
of your company,

07:30.117 --> 07:34.619
And him never
hugging me again,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.788
I will back
your project.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.390
I don't think I can do that.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.325
Neither do I.
(laughs)

07:40.327 --> 07:40.892
Barry!

07:40.894 --> 07:42.561
Okay.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.329
Look, I can't give up control.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.398
This company is my baby.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.334
But I will sell you
a minority share

07:49.336 --> 07:51.703
If you agree to work
as my product engineer.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.405
Oh, product engineer?

07:53.407 --> 07:55.440
I mean, do I look like barry?

07:55.442 --> 07:56.842
No offense, barry.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.077
Did you hear that?
He knows my name.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.913
I'm sorry, that's all
I can offer you.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.281
Well, then it's a pass.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.016
All right, thanks
for stopping by.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.786
No, no, no, come on, this
isn't how the story ends.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.921
Hold on. Th...

08:09.923 --> 08:12.557
That's it?
No negotiating?

08:12.559 --> 08:13.992
You heard my offer.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.694
There's also a
supplemental offer--

08:15.696 --> 08:17.696
Uh, best friends for life.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.333
All right, wait.
All right, fine. I...

08:21.335 --> 08:23.602
I will... Work for you,

08:23.604 --> 08:26.171
But I still need
a majority position.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.472
Good-bye, mr. Schmidt.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.142
What are you, like, some
kind of evil bond villain?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.078
All right... All right,
all right, fine!

08:33.080 --> 08:34.980
Deal.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.150
I'll... Be your number two.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.785
(clearing throat)
well...

08:40.787 --> 08:43.622
It'd actually be
number three, but...

08:45.224 --> 08:46.691
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

08:46.693 --> 08:48.193
Oh, thank god.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.394
(panting)

08:49.396 --> 08:50.762
I'm coming, charlie.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.965
I hope you have a guest room
in heaven.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.367
You shouldn't
feel so bad.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.069
He's in pretty good shape
for a guy in his 60's.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.804
He's 45.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.172
Whoa.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.842
I'll be right back.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.778
Ah... Uh... Do you mind?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.280
Actually...
(screams)

09:08.282 --> 09:11.049
Aah! It burns!
It burns!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.418
That's because it's vodka.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.520
Who brings vodka on a hike?

09:15.522 --> 09:17.756
Someone who thinks
hikes should be fun.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.725
Okay, that's it,
I'm packing it in.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.127
I think I saw a mom
with a stroller.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.495
I'm gonna hitch a ride
back downhill.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.196
No, no, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.698
Don't leave me alone
with brooke.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.301
What? Why not?
She's great.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.835
Well, here's the thing.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.505
She's-she's...
She's always trying to...

09:33.507 --> 09:35.774
Get to know me.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.809
That bitch.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.145
She's always asking me
these-these personal things.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.746
You know?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.848
"what are your dreams?"
"what was your childhood like?"

09:43.850 --> 09:45.250
"what's your last name?"

09:45.252 --> 09:47.018
You are just like your dad.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.587
He'd never open up to anybody

09:48.589 --> 09:50.188
'cause he was afraid
of rejection,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.057
So he'd reject them first.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.092
I don't want to
reject brooke.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.794
So, let her in.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.229
If you don't take a chance,
you haven't got one.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.998
Do you think I really believed

10:00.000 --> 10:01.967
That a complete stranger
would let me live

10:01.969 --> 10:03.768
In his malibu beach house
forever?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.638
No. But I took a chance,
and it paid off.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.140
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

10:09.142 --> 10:12.577
(speaking lyrics):
Everybody get up,
everybody get up...

10:12.579 --> 10:14.679
(singing):
â™ª hey, hey, hey

10:14.681 --> 10:16.848
â™ª hey, hey, hey

10:16.850 --> 10:18.316
â™ª hey, hey, hey...

10:18.318 --> 10:20.485
Hey, hey, hey!

10:21.520 --> 10:22.721
Oh, sorry.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.922
Sometimes
when I'm writing code,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.191
I get kind of lost
in my dope jams.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.593
Well, if you're gonna play
music, just play it out loud.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.261
You got it, number three.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.763
â™ª talk about getting blasted

10:31.765 --> 10:34.499
(singing along):
â™ª I hate these blurred lines

10:34.501 --> 10:36.334
â™ª I know you want it

10:36.336 --> 10:37.836
(singing along):
â™ª I know you want it

10:37.838 --> 10:40.538
â™ª I know you want it,
but you're â™ª

10:40.540 --> 10:42.173
â™ª a good girl

10:42.175 --> 10:44.809
â™ª the way you grab me

10:44.811 --> 10:46.478
â™ª talkin' 'bout gettin' nasty

10:46.480 --> 10:48.113
â™ª go ahead, get at me

10:48.115 --> 10:48.947
â™ª everybody get up

10:48.949 --> 10:50.649
â™ª what do they make dreams for

10:50.651 --> 10:52.250
â™ª when you got them jeans on

10:52.252 --> 10:54.252
â™ª what do we need steam for

10:54.254 --> 10:55.720
â™ª you the hottest bitch

10:55.722 --> 10:57.789
â™ª in this place
hey, hey, hey!

10:57.791 --> 11:00.458
â™ª you want to hug me...

11:00.460 --> 11:03.395
(music stops)

11:03.397 --> 11:05.730
It was the new guy's idea.
I was...

11:05.732 --> 11:07.332
What's that, barry?
I can't hear you

11:07.334 --> 11:09.067
From all the way under this bus.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.771
So, how's the code coming?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.572
Actually, you know,
I had a thought.

11:14.574 --> 11:18.076
Um, if we reconfigure
this kernel,

11:18.078 --> 11:20.412
We're gonna save
a lot of time and money.

11:20.414 --> 11:23.081
Yeah, it's-it's good.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.750
(high-pitched): It's just,
uh... Eh, it's-it's good.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.552
Wha-what do you think,
barry?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.087
(high-pitched):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:29.089 --> 11:32.157
It's-it's good. It's good.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.160
Why do you guys keep talking
with high voices?

11:35.162 --> 11:37.595
Why do you keep saying,
(high-pitched): "it's good"?

11:37.597 --> 11:39.064
It is good.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.066
Just, you know, for...

11:41.068 --> 11:42.967
Mmm... 2002.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.102
Ouch.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.704
I believe the correct
terminology in 2002

11:45.706 --> 11:47.972
Was, "oh, snap."

11:47.974 --> 11:51.376
(clears throat)
okay. Um...

11:51.378 --> 11:53.845
You know, I've been... I've
been doing this for a...

11:53.847 --> 11:55.113
A really long time,

11:55.115 --> 11:57.415
And I've-I've been
really successful.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.652
I know. We studied you
in school.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.421
Oh, I get it. You guys... You
guys are saying that I'm old?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.557
No.
Yeah.

12:05.559 --> 12:09.494
I thought we were going
a different way.

12:09.496 --> 12:13.498
Look, I respect you
enormously, but...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.400
I got to go with my gut.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.535
Okay. No problem.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.870
You're the boss.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.938
Thank you.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.272
Now, who wants chinese?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.408
Are you paying?
'cause I forgot my wallet...

12:23.410 --> 12:25.043
Yes, barry.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.746
Hey, I got one
just like him at home.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.183
Boy, oh, boy, you could cut
the sexual tension back there

12:32.185 --> 12:33.585
With a knife.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.053
Think she's into me?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.721
No, not you. Me.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.057
Me and her have had this whole
"will they, won't they" thing

12:39.059 --> 12:41.126
Going on for some time now.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.727
So it's like a...

12:42.729 --> 12:44.696
Ross/rachel thing?

12:44.698 --> 12:45.764
Who?

12:47.233 --> 12:48.600
Are those friends of yours?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.668
Oh, god. I am old.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.240
But with age comes wisdom.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.574
(clears throat)

12:56.576 --> 12:58.376
We're gonna do this my way.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.844
What?

12:59.846 --> 13:01.379
Nicole is wrong about the code.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.548
I'm sending you a file.
We're gonna rewrite it.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.016
Oh, this is bad.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.684
This is bad.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.019
I'm stuck between my hero

13:08.021 --> 13:10.221
And-and the future mother
of my children.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.856
Come on, barry.

13:11.858 --> 13:15.126
Don't you want to be
on a poster with me?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.762
Hop on the eagle, man.
Let's soar together.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.633
I don't know. I don't...
I don't know.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.201
You know you want it.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.971
â™ª you know you want it

13:26.973 --> 13:28.640
â™ª you know
you want it â™ª

13:28.642 --> 13:30.508
â™ª I'm a good girl

13:30.510 --> 13:32.577
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:36.582 --> 13:37.849
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
oh, good.
You're home.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.117
I need
to talk to you.
Oh,

13:39.119 --> 13:40.318
You know, actually, I'm not.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.986
I'm just here
for the essentials.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.623
Shower, change of clothes, bag
of performance-enhancing weed.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.292
Th-this won't take long.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.827
Uh, will you look
at this picture?

13:48.829 --> 13:50.829
Let me see.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.764
Was this taken
from the mars rover?

13:52.766 --> 13:53.998
No, that's my balls.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.400
(groans)

13:55.402 --> 13:57.902
Dude! What the hell?

13:57.904 --> 14:00.238
They've been burning
ever since I went on that hike.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.773
Maybe somebody's talking
about 'em.

14:01.775 --> 14:04.275
No, I'm serious.
What could it be?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.077
I don't know.
What, like, poison oak?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.512
I did take a leak in the bushes.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.782
And yet you couldn't go
in a coffee shop.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.250
Just look at the picture.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.252
Yeah. Fine.
I can't believe I'm gonna...

14:14.254 --> 14:17.255
Zoom in on your balls.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.524
I'm not gonna be able to...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.392
Oh, my god.

14:22.728 --> 14:23.728
It's a tick.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.863
What?

14:24.865 --> 14:27.265
You got a tick on your junk.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.367
Oh, god!

14:29.369 --> 14:31.536
Oh, god! Oh, god!
Oh, god!

14:31.538 --> 14:32.637
What's with him?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.973
He's got a tick on his 'nads.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.776
Huh. I never thought anything
could live off zippy.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.980
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

14:44.083 --> 14:46.484
I don't see how this is gonna
make us more productive,

14:46.486 --> 14:49.587
But I really don't care.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.856
And that is the beauty of pot.
(chuckles)

14:51.858 --> 14:54.058
You got work to do,
you don't care.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.594
You got bills to pay,
you don't care.
(chuckles)

14:56.596 --> 14:59.264
You see a picture
of your roommate's gonads...

14:59.266 --> 15:01.566
You care.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.368
(chuckles)

15:03.370 --> 15:06.537
But the image is fading.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.207
Yeah, marijuana is excellent.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.809
I don't know why I waited
this long to try it.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.912
Wait a second--
you've never been high before?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.381
I wanted it to be special.
And now I can tell everybody

15:16.383 --> 15:20.318
My first time
was with walden schmidt.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.653
Hey, when you tell that story,

15:21.655 --> 15:23.955
Maybe throw in
a few more details.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.092
(chuckles)
hey, aren't you glad
we took a second to relax?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.761
Mmm. Totally.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.231
You know, I kind of forgot
the meaning of the word "relax."

15:33.233 --> 15:35.900
Relax, relax, relax.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.936
Oh, god. I don't remember
what it means either.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.272
I'm losing my words.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.707
No, this is exactly, exactly

15:42.709 --> 15:44.776
What the commercials
warned me about.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.444
Barry, calm down.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.580
Just take a deep breath,
close your eyes, count to ten.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.082
All right, I trust you
with my life.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.650
You're my best friend.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.520
One...

15:55.522 --> 15:57.989
Two...

15:57.991 --> 16:00.391
Oh, my god, we have ice cream
sandwiches in the freezer.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.127
Hey, man, grab me one!

16:03.129 --> 16:05.463
Mmm, no,
grab me two!

16:05.465 --> 16:09.701
I want to make
an ice cream sandwich sandwich.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.669
That is an awesome idea.

16:15.441 --> 16:19.377
Are you staring at me
or am I just really paranoid?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.646
There's nothing
to be paranoid about.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.350
She's on to us. Abort.
I repeat, abort.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.652
I hate you.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.189
You don't.
You like me.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.391
You know what. Doesn't matter.

16:33.393 --> 16:37.395
Because I have a policy
about dating people I work with.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.565
Yeah, but it's
your policy, so...

16:40.567 --> 16:42.500
You can break it.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.303
You're the boss.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.805
I am, aren't I?

16:47.807 --> 16:51.642
I guess that makes me
the wo-man.

16:53.979 --> 16:54.979
You guys.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.048
I got great news.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.716
Ice cream sandwiches are
in the oven.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.251
They'll be ready in five.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.121
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

17:03.123 --> 17:04.655
You want a refill?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.758
Uh, no, I-I don't want
to get drunk.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.093
Oh, my god, did I somehow
get you pregnant?

17:09.095 --> 17:11.262
I want to get
to know you better,

17:11.264 --> 17:13.664
And I don't want anything
to get in the way of that.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.601
I really like you. Um...

17:16.603 --> 17:17.935
That's new for me.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.204
Hey, I feel the exact same way.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.740
I've never felt this vulnerable
with someone.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.576
You know, when it didn't involve
a safe word.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.911
So what are we gonna do?

17:26.913 --> 17:29.347
We can start by being honest
with each other.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.483
That's horrible.
Hey.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.752
Come on. Let's do this.

17:34.754 --> 17:38.022
Tell me a secret, something
you've never told anyone else.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.957
Something is wrong
with my balls.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.961
Something like that.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.431
I just... I-I had a tick
and I pulled it off

17:46.433 --> 17:47.698
And now they won't stop swelling

17:47.700 --> 17:49.500
And I'm afraid
they're gonna explode.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.436
So why are you telling us?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.271
Because brooke works in a salon.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.074
She waxes people. Maybe she's
seen something like this before.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.375
All right, l-let's see.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.277
Oh!

17:59.279 --> 18:01.779
Oh...

18:01.781 --> 18:03.981
Boy, if I wasn't gay before...

18:05.617 --> 18:07.618
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

18:07.620 --> 18:10.988
(exhales)
check it out, dude.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.462
Where's your other hand
in that picture?

18:19.598 --> 18:20.898
What the hell?

18:20.900 --> 18:23.668
Three people can't fit
on an eagle.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.972
You-you changed my code.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.974
Yeah. I made it better.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.210
No, you didn't.
We went over this.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.546
(chuckles)
okay. Everybody who's made
a billion dollars

18:35.548 --> 18:37.882
Off their software in this room,
raise your hand.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.750
(gasps, chuckles)

18:39.752 --> 18:41.986
Look at that. It's just me.
Okay.

18:41.988 --> 18:46.157
Everyone who owns 51% of
this company, raise their hand.

18:46.159 --> 18:49.327
(chuckles)
look at that. Just me.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.762
Everybody who's still
a little high

18:51.764 --> 18:53.631
And is worried that that's...

18:53.633 --> 18:56.434
Never gonna stop,
raise your hand.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.238
Crap. That's just me.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.173
Listen, just go

19:02.175 --> 19:03.174
With me on this.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.343
No, I don't work
for you anymore.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.412
Okay, look, I know you think
you know what you're doing.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.349
But, trust me, you don't.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.819
And I know you think
you still work here,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.622
But, trust me, you don't.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.159
You're fired.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.161
(whirring)

19:23.163 --> 19:25.530
Oh, snap.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.000
Look, I-I was just trying
to help.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.436
Well, it's gonna take me a day
to undo your "help."

19:32.438 --> 19:35.373
A day? Come on.
I can undo this in an hour.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.411
You should just...
You should just go, dude.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.246
Okay.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.915
Fine.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.249
If that's what you want.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.417
It is.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.153
Barry, it was an honor
to fly with you.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.391
Honor was all mine.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.227
At ease.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.931
All right.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.265
Oh, uh, one last thing.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.301
We're done.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.435
I don't work with you anymore.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.037
That's what
"you're fired" means.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.040
Good. So this isn't
a bad idea anymore.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.783
Can I be fired, too?

20:19.751 --> 20:21.452
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:23.789 --> 20:26.657
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
okay.
(grunts)
okay.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.826
Um, I just, uh, want
to point out that,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.895
Uh, due
to my engorged testicles,

20:30.897 --> 20:34.065
Uh, my penis is not currently
to scale,

20:34.067 --> 20:35.399
So...

20:35.401 --> 20:37.268
Yeah, yeah, here it is.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.270
When you pulled out the tick,
you didn't get all of it

20:39.272 --> 20:40.938
So it got inflamed.
Oh.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.006
(groans)

20:42.008 --> 20:43.341
It's like you're the hulk,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.977
But only your balls got angry.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.480
You know, this is what
relationships are all about.

20:49.482 --> 20:53.618
Watching your girlfriend pull
a tick out of your uncle's junk.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.187
Aw. I'm your girlfriend?

20:58.156 --> 21:00.791
If it's a boy, name it walden.
