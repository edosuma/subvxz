Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.320 --> 00:05.020
Last night I witnessed
one of the worst performances

00:05.021 --> 00:06.822
on scallops ever.

00:06.823 --> 00:08.924
(Announcer) Chef Ramsey took
the chefs back to basics,

00:08.925 --> 00:10.426
with a simple scallop
challenge...

00:10.427 --> 00:12.395
<i>(Gordon)

00:14.531 --> 00:16.165
(Announcer)
That the men found...

00:16.166 --> 00:17.666
I want five scallops
all the same!

00:17.667 --> 00:18.601
(Announcer)
Anything but simple.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.169
Start again!

00:20.170 --> 00:22.538
This is gonna be a little
[bleep] tougher than I thought.

00:22.539 --> 00:23.939
(Announcer)
Barbie was outstanding.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.708
Great job.

00:25.709 --> 00:28.110
Keep it simple, get perfect
plates up to that pass.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.279

was still mystified by the scallops.

00:38.555 --> 00:40.055
Chris, how long on those
scallops?

00:40.056 --> 00:42.057
Scallops, ten seconds.

00:42.058 --> 00:44.293
Touch those [bleep] scallops.
How dare you!

00:44.294 --> 00:46.929
(Chris) We cannot [bleep] up
scallops over and over again.

00:46.930 --> 00:48.531
(Announcer)
But to everyone's surprise,

00:48.532 --> 00:49.865
Barbie wasn't any better.

00:49.866 --> 00:50.866
Nothing.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.368
What's the matter with you?

00:52.369 --> 00:53.135
(Announcer)
And she was dethroned...

00:53.136 --> 00:54.136
Look at this.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.604
(Announcer)
As the scallop queen.

00:55.605 --> 00:57.239
Did you lose your mind
overnight?

00:57.240 --> 00:58.841
(Danielle)
Barbie, what is going on?

00:58.842 --> 01:00.943
You're, like,
our scallop champion.

01:00.944 --> 01:03.712

01:03.713 --> 01:05.714
Ladies, stop!

01:05.715 --> 01:07.416
Touch them.

kicked out of the kitchen...

Tiffany led the red team,

01:13.457 --> 01:15.391

against Barbie.

01:20.464 --> 01:21.931
(Announcer)
Back in the kitchen,

01:21.932 --> 01:23.833
Royce was clueless on garnish.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.434
<i>(Guy) Come on, Royce.</i>

01:25.435 --> 01:26.669
Royce gets so [bleep] nervous.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.503
He's like a little girl.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.872
I don't know how to
wake you up any more.

01:29.873 --> 01:30.873

And when the blue team

01:30.874 --> 01:31.941
made a fatal error...

01:31.942 --> 01:33.576
(Gordon) What is that?

01:33.577 --> 01:35.644
<i>I'm opening a steak house.</i>

01:35.645 --> 01:36.979
All of you, get out!

01:36.980 --> 01:38.280
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay decided

01:38.281 --> 01:39.415
there would be no winning team.

01:39.416 --> 01:42.051
A sinking ship,
and a runaway train.

01:42.052 --> 01:45.020

with two individuals.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.991
<i>(Announcer) And...

01:51.272 --> 01:52.761
<i>(Announcer) And...
Barbie.</i>

01:52.762 --> 01:54.864
(Announcer) And when chef
Ramsay had a question...

01:54.865 --> 01:56.532
So who is the worst
on the red team, then?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.033
(Announcer) Barbie didn't
hesitate to answer.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.702
Robyn and Kimmie, chef.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.836
What?!

02:00.837 --> 02:01.837

But in the end it was...

02:01.838 --> 02:03.973
Chris.

02:03.974 --> 02:06.108
(Announcer) Whose dream
of becoming head chef

Why were you firing the pizza

08:05.001 --> 08:06.435
when they didn't serve
the Cobb salad?

08:06.436 --> 08:08.070
I made a mistake, chef.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.038
(Kimmie)
Barbie, I cook the pizzas.

08:10.039 --> 08:11.874
Why are you making
the pizza already?

08:11.875 --> 08:12.941
They ain't even got
the Cobb salads yet.

08:12.942 --> 08:14.276
Communicate with me.

08:14.277 --> 08:15.577
Yo, where's the salad?

08:15.578 --> 08:16.778
How many fries?
We need any fries?

08:16.779 --> 08:18.814
<i>(Kimmie) I can't hear you.</i>

08:18.815 --> 08:20.249
Real quick, listen!

08:20.250 --> 08:22.517
All the Cobb salads
need to go out before

08:22.518 --> 08:24.353
<i>we can even start the entrees.
Let's go.</i>

08:24.354 --> 08:25.754
Thank you, Robyn.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.422
I'm gonna sit here and cut your
tomatoes.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.924
Somebody needed to step up.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.626
This is my chance
to prove myself,

08:30.627 --> 08:32.895
and prove to chef Ramsay that
I have what it takes to be here.

08:32.895 --> 08:35.197
Ladies, we got this, all right.
Come on, I'm gonna run it.

08:35.198 --> 08:37.099
Man, I felt like I had
a rocket up my [bleep]

08:37.100 --> 08:38.700
is how fast I was moving
in that kitchen.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.068
[Mimics wind]

08:40.068 --> 08:41.303
Behind, chef.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.337
Very nice.

08:42.337 --> 08:44.106
Service, please.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.474
Salads are out, ladies,
salads are out.

08:45.475 --> 08:47.376
Mmm, this is good.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.144
(Announcer) Thanks to Robyn,

08:49.145 --> 08:50.946
the women are moving on
to their first entrees.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.850
But over on the blue side,
nothing has left the kitchen.

08:54.851 --> 08:56.985
And it's all thanks
to the man on salads.

08:56.986 --> 08:58.220
<i>Royce!
Yes, chef?</i>

08:58.221 --> 08:59.521
Where's your Cobb salad?

08:59.522 --> 09:00.756
One minute, chef.

09:00.757 --> 09:01.823
Come on, Royce,
pick it up, buddy.

09:01.824 --> 09:02.958
<i>Let's get one out.</i>

09:02.959 --> 09:04.493
Royce is capable of doing this.

09:04.494 --> 09:06.261
Royce is gonna perform
like a [bleep].

09:06.262 --> 09:07.896
Royce is getting fired up.

09:07.897 --> 09:09.131
First one up.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.000
(Gordon) Unbelievable.

09:12.001 --> 09:14.469
<i>Hey, all of you, come here,
muppets.</i>

09:14.470 --> 09:19.274
Royce decide to put mushrooms
on a Californian Cobb salad.

09:19.275 --> 09:22.711
[Bleep] me.

09:22.712 --> 09:24.012
Royce is just a [bleep] idiot!

09:24.013 --> 09:25.714
It's mind-boggling.

09:25.715 --> 09:27.616
You're back there on salads.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.418
All's you're doing is
assembling something on a plate

09:29.419 --> 09:31.954
where 50% is already
done for you,

09:31.955 --> 09:33.288
and you can't get it right?

09:33.289 --> 09:34.890
I got salad coming right now.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.858
Why are you helping me
make a [bleep] salad?

09:36.859 --> 09:38.827
You didn't put out one!
Come on, guys, please.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.128
It's a [bleep] salad!

09:40.129 --> 09:41.596
Give me a bowl.
Give me a bowl!

09:41.597 --> 09:42.931
Salad's in the window.
Let's go.

09:42.932 --> 09:45.767
Second salad going up.
Just behind.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.672
Service, please.
Beautiful. Good job.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.941
(Announcer)
With Guy and Clemenza

09:52.942 --> 09:54.509
coming to the rescue,

09:54.510 --> 09:55.944
salads are finally leaving
the blue kitchen.

09:55.945 --> 09:58.647
Cobb salad.
Thank you.

09:58.648 --> 10:01.283
<i>(Justin) Keep pushing, keep pushing.
Do not give up.</i>

10:01.284 --> 10:03.185
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...

10:03.186 --> 10:05.354
Sliders, walking to the window.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.589
( Announcer) The women
are ready to send out

10:07.590 --> 10:09.891
their first table of entrees.
All they need is...

10:09.892 --> 10:12.227
<i>Pizza.
Barbie.</i>

10:12.228 --> 10:15.297
Pizzas need just...
oh, my [bleep] God!

10:15.298 --> 10:16.999
You're killing me!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.434
Barbie, you're a stupid bitch.
Get the [bleep] off my station.

10:19.435 --> 10:22.270
I don't need your help.
Just garnish the [bleep] pizzas.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.706
Barbie, Barbie! I need...
what are you doing?

10:24.707 --> 10:27.275
Just stay at your station!
Okay. Got it.

10:27.276 --> 10:29.611
(Kimmie) She's moving
around like a jumping Jack,

10:29.612 --> 10:31.613
and she's cooking pizzas
when she's not supposed to.

10:31.614 --> 10:34.216
Ladies, where is
the [bleep] pizza?

10:34.217 --> 10:36.752
Pizza's here, chef.

10:36.753 --> 10:39.454
That looks like [bleep].

10:39.455 --> 10:41.857
Hey, all of you, come here.
Welcome to America.

10:41.858 --> 10:45.260
Look at that.
You eat that bit now.

10:45.261 --> 10:46.895
Hey, come here.
You eat that as well.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.163
That's what you're
serving them.

10:48.164 --> 10:51.700
Burnt, [bleep] black pizza.

10:51.701 --> 10:55.003
I'd rather flee
the [bleep] country.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.339
I'm so sick of this bitch.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.974
With Barbie the way
that she is,

10:58.975 --> 11:00.142
I can't tell
if she's sabotaging

11:00.143 --> 11:01.243
or if she's actually
trying to help.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.644
Get off the pizzas.
Yes, chef.

11:02.645 --> 11:05.047
It's getting old, seriously.

11:05.048 --> 11:07.816
Barbie sucks.
She pisses everybody off.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.317
She needs to go home.

11:09.318 --> 11:10.619
(Announcer)
While Barbie has been deported

11:10.620 --> 11:12.154
from the pizza station...

11:12.155 --> 11:14.156
(Barbie) Building burgers.
I can build burgers.

11:14.157 --> 11:15.757
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...

11:15.758 --> 11:17.392
I got this in the [bleep] bag.

11:17.393 --> 11:19.327
(Announcer) Clemenza is ready
to give these new citizens

11:19.328 --> 11:21.897
a little taste of his part
of the world.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.665
You good, Clemenza?
I'm coming.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.333
Don't worry about
the pizza, man.

11:25.334 --> 11:26.601
Dude, coming from New York,
come on.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.736
I ate a lot of [bleep] pizza
in my life.

11:27.737 --> 11:29.337
My family actually owned
a pizzeria.

11:29.338 --> 11:31.339
It's right up my alley.
Pizza up, chef!

11:31.340 --> 11:33.475
What is that?

11:33.476 --> 11:34.976
It's not even cooked.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.345
Clemenza, the pizza's
not cooked enough.

11:37.346 --> 11:38.580
Thin, New York style
crisp pizza.

11:38.581 --> 11:39.981
I got it, chef.

11:39.982 --> 11:42.350
You should be able to nail
a New York style pizza.

11:42.351 --> 11:43.685
This is a joke!

11:43.686 --> 11:45.153
Get me another pizza going.

11:45.154 --> 11:47.222
What the [bleep]?
I don't know.

11:47.223 --> 11:49.858
How do you [bleep] up a pizza?
They take two seconds to cook.

11:49.859 --> 11:51.960
Dump the thing on the ground
and fire another one.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.562
Come on, Clemenza.
Come on, buddy. Come on!

11:53.563 --> 11:54.996
How long on the pizza?

11:54.997 --> 11:56.565
Coming up on the pizza soon.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.800
Make sure it's perfect,
Clemenza.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.403
(Announcer) While the men are
stalled, waiting on pizza...

12:01.404 --> 12:03.138
Bounce back.
I know.

Coming down the line.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.575

Rallies, and entrees continue

12:06.576 --> 12:08.510
to quickly make their way
to the dining room.

12:08.511 --> 12:11.613
Pizza's walking right now.
Burgers walking now.

12:11.614 --> 12:13.181
We got you, we're walking
to the window with you.

12:13.182 --> 12:14.349
Pizza time, babe.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.084
Now we're finally
communicating. Hallelujah.

Typically American.

12:22.225 --> 12:23.525
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful.

12:23.526 --> 12:24.826

12:28.364 --> 12:30.065

12:30.066 --> 12:32.067
(Announcer) And the men
are now counting on Brian

12:32.068 --> 12:33.668

12:33.669 --> 12:35.904
You got the slider up?
Coming right now, baby.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.806
It's go time.

12:37.807 --> 12:40.308
And I am going to be there
for my team.

12:40.309 --> 12:42.144
This is easy.
It's mini burgers.

12:42.145 --> 12:44.679
Oh, dear.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.348
Look at me, all of you!

12:46.349 --> 12:48.383
It's [bleep] raw.

12:48.384 --> 12:51.820

and we welcome them with that.

12:51.821 --> 12:53.221
<i>This is embarrassing.</i>

12:53.222 --> 12:55.357

Who did this?

12:59.462 --> 13:01.897
<i>(Gordon) Oh, God!</i>

13:44.973 --> 13:46.140
A slider.

13:46.141 --> 13:47.775
Brian, I'm gonna
help you right now.

13:47.776 --> 13:50.411

grown-ass men

13:50.412 --> 13:51.979

13:51.980 --> 13:53.247
It's a little burger.

15:48.263 --> 15:49.630
I'd like you all to hurry up

15:49.631 --> 15:54.301
because your private jet...
Oh, my God.

15:54.302 --> 15:56.236
<i>(Gordon) Is about to
taxi down the runway.</i>

15:56.237 --> 15:57.938
Hurry up.
Let's go.

15:57.939 --> 16:01.675
[Shrieking]

16:01.676 --> 16:04.545
Honestly, guys, it was just
like a fragmented kitchen

16:04.546 --> 16:06.947
with several of you
all doing your own thing.

16:06.948 --> 16:10.384
Where is the leader
on the blue team?

16:10.385 --> 16:13.487
<i>One of you guys
had better take over.</i>

16:16.291 --> 16:17.658
I'm taking it over, chef.

16:17.659 --> 16:19.293
I need to see it.
Yes, chef.

16:19.294 --> 16:21.695
I think Patrick's
way over his head.

16:21.696 --> 16:24.131
But if it gets us to win,
I don't really care.

16:24.132 --> 16:25.666
Let's see what he's got.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.568
Listen carefully.
I volunteered you all

16:27.569 --> 16:30.337
for some very difficult
hard labor...

16:30.338 --> 16:33.407
at one of California's
treasures...

16:33.408 --> 16:37.411
the Ballona Wetlands.

16:37.412 --> 16:38.745
<i>Got it?
(All) Yes, chef.</i>

16:38.746 --> 16:39.913
Let's go.

16:39.914 --> 16:42.749
Hell's Kitchen sucks
when you lose.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.018
We're in for a [bleep] day.
There's no way around it.

16:45.019 --> 16:47.721
I just gotta find a way
to turn this thing around

16:47.722 --> 16:49.156
in favor of the blue team.

16:49.157 --> 16:50.757
All right, guys,
you know what...

16:50.758 --> 16:52.359
Let's get positive
a little bit, all right?

16:59.033 --> 17:00.601
<i>(Gordon) Ladies, welcome.</i>

17:00.602 --> 17:02.603
Jump aboard your G4.

17:02.604 --> 17:06.306
Oh, this is crazy.

17:06.307 --> 17:08.008
Welcome, Kimmie. Enjoy.
Yes.

17:08.009 --> 17:10.477
We're going up, up, up.

17:10.478 --> 17:12.746
Yeah, we're going up in a G4.

17:12.747 --> 17:14.882
We're ready to rock out
with our [bleep] out.

17:14.883 --> 17:18.518
Ladies, congratulations.
Good job. Here's to the boys.

17:18.519 --> 17:20.420
(All) To the boys!

17:20.421 --> 17:23.723
(Announcer) While the women get
used to traveling in style,

17:23.724 --> 17:26.159
the men spend the day
on the laborious task

17:26.160 --> 17:28.194
of beautifying
an American treasure.

17:28.195 --> 17:29.663
So this is the acacia tree
right here that we're gonna

17:29.664 --> 17:32.599
cut down completely.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.202
<i>Holy [bleep]!</i>

17:35.203 --> 17:37.471
Big-ass thick tree,
like that,

17:37.472 --> 17:39.473
with [bleep] branches
sprouting out.

17:39.474 --> 17:41.241
We're gonna need Paul Bunyan
to chop this thing down.

17:41.242 --> 17:43.944
[Bleep] bugs.

17:43.945 --> 17:46.647
[Spits]

17:48.249 --> 17:49.883
<i>Oh, my God.
Look at that rhino!</i>

17:49.884 --> 17:52.819
He looks like Clemenza.
[Laughs]

17:52.820 --> 17:56.089
The safari.
[Makes animal sound]

17:56.090 --> 17:58.458
All you see is rhinoceroses

17:58.459 --> 18:01.061
and these tall giraffes
and baby giraffes.

18:01.062 --> 18:03.730
[Laughs]

18:03.731 --> 18:07.000
Dude, these giraffes want
to, like, make out with us.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.402
This is the most action
I've gotten in a week.

18:08.403 --> 18:09.136
This is nice.

18:09.137 --> 18:10.370
[Laughing and giggling]

18:10.371 --> 18:12.506
He's trying to eat your face.

18:12.507 --> 18:14.374
[Laughter]

18:14.375 --> 18:16.276
Congratulations.
Well done.

18:16.277 --> 18:18.211
On our next dinner service,
can you promise me one thing?

18:18.212 --> 18:21.415
Yes, chef.
Right hand up.

18:21.416 --> 18:22.582
I...
[All repeating]

18:22.583 --> 18:27.955
Swear...
That we will complete service.

18:27.956 --> 18:29.957
Ladies, good job.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.959
I apologize, everyone,
in front of chef,

18:31.960 --> 18:35.095
<i>for waking you up this morning.</i>

18:35.096 --> 18:37.297
You woke them up?

18:37.298 --> 18:38.966
Wow.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.368
<i>I will not let it happen again.</i>

18:41.369 --> 18:43.070
(Robyn) Hell no, I don't
believe Barbie's apology.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.705
That bitch is fake.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.373
I know it wasn't sincere.

18:46.374 --> 18:48.041
You can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

18:50.878 --> 18:53.180
Why are we fighting it?
It's not that big.

18:53.181 --> 18:55.015
Break it down, small pieces.

18:55.016 --> 18:56.917
Work smart, not hard.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.685
<i>Let's start loading these up.</i>

18:58.686 --> 19:01.455
Patrick, he's not leading
by example.

19:01.456 --> 19:03.857
He's leading by saying
what to do.

19:03.858 --> 19:05.759
Can you just take that one
wheelbarrow up to Guy?

19:05.760 --> 19:07.594
I don't like it.
Everybody together.

19:07.595 --> 19:10.197
One, two, three!

19:10.198 --> 19:12.866
Push! Let's go, baby, let's go!
Come on. Come on.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.901
[All grunt]

19:14.902 --> 19:16.870
Up, up, up, up, up.
Okay, ready?

19:16.871 --> 19:18.839
I'm 100% proud
of my team today, man.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.907
We came together as a unit,
and we got the job done.

19:20.908 --> 19:22.843
Push, push.

19:22.844 --> 19:25.145
But you know, unless we can
figure it out in the kitchen,

19:25.146 --> 19:27.080
all that [bleep]
doesn't really matter.

19:27.081 --> 19:30.283
Bravo. No more losing, guys.
No more losing.

19:33.888 --> 19:38.191
(Announcer) Hell's Kitchen is hours
away from opening its doors...

19:38.192 --> 19:40.293
We made a promise
yesterday, guys.

19:40.294 --> 19:42.629
Yeah, we did.
We cannot break that.

19:42.630 --> 19:43.997
We all gave chef Ramsay an oath

19:43.998 --> 19:45.732
that we will successfully

19:45.733 --> 19:48.168
complete this dinner service
tonight.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.504
(Announcer) The red team is confident
they will keep their promise.

19:50.505 --> 19:52.406
Feeling good, feeling great.

19:52.407 --> 19:54.441
(Announcer)
Over in the blue kitchen,

19:54.442 --> 19:56.610
Patrick is determined
to lead his team to victory.

19:56.611 --> 19:58.311
(Patrick) What's that? What's that?
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

19:58.312 --> 19:58.979
Cauliflower puree.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.447
You gotta heat that up first

20:00.448 --> 20:02.015
before you put it
in a squeeze bottle.

20:02.016 --> 20:04.084
(Announcer) But not everyone
is ready to follow.

20:04.085 --> 20:07.120
Everybody is [bleep]
wasting [bleep] time.

20:07.121 --> 20:08.789
Patrick's leading this team,

20:08.790 --> 20:10.390
and he's not doing anything
to help anybody.

20:10.391 --> 20:11.691
Royce, where we at?
Just getting our equipment.

20:11.692 --> 20:13.393
I wouldn't go so high on these.
I'm not.

20:13.394 --> 20:17.230
I just want him to know
that he sucks.

20:17.231 --> 20:19.633
(Patrick) Everyone make sure we
have nonstick pans, nonstick pans.

20:19.634 --> 20:21.234
<i>Got it.</i>

20:21.235 --> 20:23.270
Royce needs to calm down
on the cockiness.

20:23.271 --> 20:25.505
I don't need crap from him.
Shut up and do it.

20:25.506 --> 20:27.674
Let's do the proteins first.
I'm getting all the equipment first.

20:27.675 --> 20:30.143
You can step off.
Shut the [bleep] up!

20:36.247 --> 20:38.315
(Announcer) Tonight, the
doors of Hell's Kitchen

20:38.316 --> 20:40.084
will open for the third time.

20:40.085 --> 20:42.419
Dude, we are finishing
this [bleep] service, I swear.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.989
(Announcer) Unbelievably, neither
team has completed a dinner service.

20:44.990 --> 20:46.924
Royce, where we at?
Just getting our equipment.

20:46.925 --> 20:48.926
I wouldn't go so high on these.
I'm not.

20:48.927 --> 20:51.128
(Announcer) And there is a power
struggle in the blue kitchen

20:51.129 --> 20:52.529
between Royce and Patrick.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.999
Step off!
Shut the [bleep] up!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.401
(Royce) Right now, I know
that I need to step it up,

20:57.402 --> 20:58.969
but I don't need
one of my teammates

20:58.970 --> 21:00.537
telling me what to do.

21:00.538 --> 21:03.474
Especially
Mr. Bandana Patrick.

21:03.475 --> 21:05.643
Let's go, let's go.
Quick. Line up, please.

21:05.644 --> 21:10.648
Listen, James is fed up
apologizing to patrons.

21:10.649 --> 21:13.317
They are idiots.
I do apologize.

21:13.318 --> 21:14.852
I'll see what I can do.

21:14.853 --> 21:17.721
So I decided one person
from each team

21:17.722 --> 21:22.559
is gonna be working as waiters.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.862
Uh, ladies...
Tiffany.

21:24.863 --> 21:26.864
<i>Big smile. Yeah?
Yes, chef.</i>

21:26.865 --> 21:29.133
Uh, blue team...
Donald.

21:29.134 --> 21:30.934
Yes, chef.

21:30.935 --> 21:32.703
I need to see each
and every one of you

21:32.704 --> 21:34.938
focused for the entire service.
Yes?

21:34.939 --> 21:36.807
(All) Yes, chef.
The key tonight is...

21:36.808 --> 21:38.776
(All) Focus!
Okay.

21:38.777 --> 21:42.212
Go on your sections. Let's go, guys.
(All) Yes, chef.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.214
(Announcer) After two diointing
services from Royce...

21:44.215 --> 21:46.784
Royce, two seconds, please.

21:46.785 --> 21:48.952
Chef Ramsay knows
just who to call...

21:48.953 --> 21:50.587
Ralph, his boss at home.

21:50.588 --> 21:52.823
<i>Ralph, how are you?
I'm doing fantastic.</i>

21:52.824 --> 21:55.592
I know who he's calling...
Ralph Pagano...

21:55.593 --> 21:57.561
And I'm, like,
"Oh, [bleep]. Oh, [bleep]."

21:57.562 --> 22:00.497
Win, lose, or draw,
I've got no reservations

22:00.498 --> 22:02.700
about how I performed
and what I did here.

22:02.701 --> 22:05.669
Ralph. Just lift it a little
bit, will you, please? Come on.

22:05.670 --> 22:06.870
<i>Hey, chef.
Royce?</i>

22:06.871 --> 22:08.539
<i>Yeah.
How you doing?</i>

22:08.540 --> 22:10.474
It's [bleep] brutal, bro.

22:10.475 --> 22:12.276
Out of anybody that knows,

22:12.277 --> 22:14.912
<i>chef Ralph knows
Hell's Kitchen's no joke.</i>

22:14.913 --> 22:17.347
<i>This is your time.
This is what it's all about.</i>

22:17.348 --> 22:19.083
<i>Yes, chef.
It's time to step up</i>

22:19.084 --> 22:21.218
<i>and knock it out.
Thank you, chef.</i>

22:21.219 --> 22:23.420
I gotta push through
and I gotta stay confident.

22:23.421 --> 22:24.688
I gotta stay focused.
Being on the phone with him

22:24.689 --> 22:27.091
made me believe
that I can win this.

22:27.092 --> 22:28.892
Tonight's the night, right?
Tonight's the night.

22:28.893 --> 22:30.627
<i>Let's go. Uh, James.
Yes, chef.</i>

22:30.628 --> 22:31.895
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

22:31.896 --> 22:32.629
Yes, chef.

22:41.906 --> 22:44.241
(Announcer) Tonight's dinner
service is fully booked

22:44.242 --> 22:45.776
with excited diners...

22:45.777 --> 22:48.178
I'll have the risotto
and the rack of lamb.

22:48.179 --> 22:50.013
(Announcer) And American
heroes looking forward

22:50.014 --> 22:52.082
to an evening of fine dining.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.051
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

22:54.052 --> 22:55.719
(Announcer) And chef
Ramsay is hoping his chefs

22:55.720 --> 22:57.688
can finally deliver it.

22:57.689 --> 22:59.423
Okay, blue team, here we go.
Look at me.

22:59.424 --> 23:01.358
Focus. Let's go.
Flatbread away.

23:01.359 --> 23:03.827
Two spaghetti, two risotto.
(All) Yes, chef.

23:03.828 --> 23:05.796
I'm ready. I'll take this
[bleep] to the next level.

23:05.797 --> 23:06.697
I've come
with my "A" game, baby.

23:06.698 --> 23:08.198
"A" plus plus!

23:08.199 --> 23:09.633
I'm going with the risotto.
Go.

23:09.634 --> 23:11.702
Right behind you, chef.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.508
(Gordon) Who made the risotto?

23:17.509 --> 23:19.610
<i>Me, chef.
Risotto's delicious.</i>

23:19.611 --> 23:21.512
Keep it going, Royce.
Yes, chef.

23:21.513 --> 23:23.881
I'm back.
You got Royce Wagner back.

23:23.882 --> 23:25.849
I wish you'd spoken
to Ralph earlier. [Bleep] me.

23:25.850 --> 23:27.518
guys, keep it going!

23:27.519 --> 23:29.486
(Announcer) With Royce
delivering on appetizers,

23:29.487 --> 23:31.388
the men are off
to a smooth start.

23:31.389 --> 23:32.723
Keep it going, guys.
Don't lose focus.

23:32.724 --> 23:33.957
Keep it going.

23:33.958 --> 23:35.726
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
the women in the red kitchen...

23:35.727 --> 23:37.461
I'm dying on a spaghetti
and a risotto.

23:37.462 --> 23:39.263
(Announcer)
Are off to a bumpy beginning.

23:39.264 --> 23:41.632
<i>How long, Dana?
Right now, chef.</i>

23:41.633 --> 23:43.834
Put it down!
[Bleep].

23:43.835 --> 23:46.303
It's like soup.
Dana!

23:46.304 --> 23:49.072
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

23:49.073 --> 23:51.175
It's like canned soup.

23:51.176 --> 23:52.943
How much sauce you put
in there, Dana?

23:52.944 --> 23:55.479
Too much, chef.
Just [bleep] off with you.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.081
I mean, it's just like piss!

23:58.082 --> 23:59.616
I have another one coming
right now, chef.

23:59.617 --> 24:01.185
You know, I [bleep] up.

24:01.186 --> 24:03.287
Any one little thing
can set the whole team back.

24:03.288 --> 24:06.290
And I don't want to be the
person bringing my team down.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.158
Dana, get your wits about you.

24:08.159 --> 24:10.160
Just wake up a bit!
Yes, chef.

24:10.161 --> 24:12.029
Come on, ladies,
let's get it together.

24:12.030 --> 24:13.764
(Announcer)
While Dana's soupy spaghetti

24:13.765 --> 24:15.499
spells trouble
for the red kitchen...

24:15.500 --> 24:17.935
What else is going
with that, do you know?

24:17.936 --> 24:20.070
(Announcer)
Out in the dining room...

24:20.071 --> 24:21.104
James, can I have the tickets
written properly, please?

24:21.105 --> 24:23.507
Yes, chef.
A-p-p...

24:23.508 --> 24:26.777
(Announcer) Don's inability to
spell is a little troubling.

24:26.778 --> 24:30.681
A-p-p...
Both: e-t-i-z-e-r-s.

24:30.682 --> 24:32.850
With a line.
E-r-s.

24:32.851 --> 24:34.751
Not being the best speller
in the world,

24:34.752 --> 24:37.888
you know,
trying to write "appetizers..."

24:37.889 --> 24:40.257
Oh, man...
[Bleep] hard.

24:40.258 --> 24:41.725
Oh, [bleep] hard!

24:41.726 --> 24:43.861
It's right, sir.

24:43.862 --> 24:45.529
Congratulations.

24:45.530 --> 24:47.598
You've just gone past
sixth grade.

24:47.599 --> 24:49.600
Thick [bleep].

24:49.601 --> 24:51.702
(Announcer)
With Don's tickets finally in...

24:51.703 --> 24:54.104
Caesar salad coming to the pass.
Two Caesar salads.

24:54.105 --> 24:56.440
(Announcer) The blue team have
put their differences aside

24:56.441 --> 24:58.242
and are pushing out
the remaining appetizers.

24:58.243 --> 25:00.010
Right behind you, chef.
[lndistinct]

25:00.011 --> 25:01.945
That's what I like to hear.
Good work.

25:01.946 --> 25:03.447
Things are going smooth,
things are going out,

25:03.448 --> 25:05.182
things are looking good.
And for once,

25:05.183 --> 25:06.917
everything's coming together
beautiful right now.

25:06.918 --> 25:08.285
Service, please.
Here you go.

25:08.286 --> 25:10.320
Thank you.
That's really good.

25:10.321 --> 25:12.222
Guys, phenomenal start, yes?

25:12.223 --> 25:13.357
<i>Keep it going.</i>

25:13.358 --> 25:15.058
(All) Yes, chef.
First entree...

25:15.059 --> 25:16.860
Two Wellington, one lamb,
one cod. How long?

25:16.861 --> 25:20.530
20 minutes.
20 minutes?

25:20.531 --> 25:22.032
15 minutes. 15 minutes.

25:22.033 --> 25:24.868
What? Come here, you big boy.
Come here.

25:24.869 --> 25:27.271
10 minutes. I'm sorry.
10 minutes... Or less.

25:30.308 --> 25:32.142
I don't [bleep] know.
Give me a second.

25:32.143 --> 25:35.212
Let me get
my [bleep] head together.

25:35.213 --> 25:37.381
<i>How long?
Lamb's coming up.</i>

25:37.382 --> 25:39.349
Everything's coming up now.
Where is it?

25:39.350 --> 25:40.817
Coming through. Coming through.
Coming through.

25:40.818 --> 25:41.318
Lamb's going past.

25:41.319 --> 25:44.121
Lamb's up, chef.

25:44.122 --> 25:46.657
Clemenza!
Come here, you!

25:46.658 --> 25:50.160
Yes, chef.
[Bleep].

25:50.161 --> 25:51.962
They're cooked beautifully.

25:51.963 --> 25:54.298
Now that you've raised the bar,
you [bleep] stay there.

25:54.299 --> 25:56.133
I swear to God, I'll [bleep]
burst you if you drop it.

25:56.134 --> 25:58.502
<i>Thank you, chef.
Service, please.</i>

25:58.503 --> 26:01.038
It's a lamb chop, no big thing.
You know, I'm good like that.

26:01.039 --> 26:03.040
Throw it at me, I'll [bleep]
take whatever you got coming.

26:03.041 --> 26:04.608
Let's go.

26:04.609 --> 26:06.710
(Announcer) With Clemenza coming
through on the meat station,

26:06.711 --> 26:08.245
the men are off
to their best start yet.

26:08.246 --> 26:09.813
Back in the red kitchen,
Dana...

26:09.814 --> 26:11.581
How long on the spaghetti?

26:11.582 --> 26:13.417
(Announcer) Is trying to
redeem herself on appetizers.

26:13.418 --> 26:14.584
Lobster spaghetti
right behind you.

26:16.754 --> 26:18.989
<i>Very nice, that spaghetti.
Thank you, chef.</i>

26:18.990 --> 26:20.991
<i>Nice job, Dana.
Thank you.</i>

26:20.992 --> 26:23.727
What else can I say, dude?
I'm the best.

26:23.728 --> 26:25.729
The next table, firefighters.

26:25.730 --> 26:27.331
Do not screw
their [bleep] table.

26:27.332 --> 26:28.865
Let me tell you.
Yes, chef.

26:28.866 --> 26:30.467
Two scallops, one onion tart,

26:30.468 --> 26:32.402
<i>one lobster spaghetti.
(All) Yes, chef.</i>

26:32.403 --> 26:33.804
I'm feeling confident.

26:33.805 --> 26:36.406
I'm feeling like chef
is gonna say,

26:36.407 --> 26:38.575
"these scallops
are sexy, bitch!"

26:38.576 --> 26:40.844
<i>I don't know, I'm a sexy bitch.
I don't know.</i>

26:40.845 --> 26:43.714
Oh, [bleep].
[Bleep] me!

26:44.749 --> 26:48.018
Come here.

26:48.019 --> 26:52.022
All of you.
All of you, come here!

26:52.023 --> 26:53.023
Who cooked them?

26:53.024 --> 26:54.691
I did, chef.
You did?

26:54.692 --> 26:56.693
<i>Yes, chef.
For the firefighters of this country?</i>

26:56.694 --> 26:58.462
[Bleep]!

26:58.463 --> 27:01.465
[Bleep] scallops!

27:01.466 --> 27:03.367
Two more!
Hurry up!

27:03.368 --> 27:05.569
(Announcer) While Barbie tries
to bounce back on scallops...

27:05.570 --> 27:07.404
<i>Grab the scallops.
I'm grabbing scallops.</i>

27:07.405 --> 27:08.772
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...

27:08.773 --> 27:10.240
Listen up.
U.S. marines...

27:10.241 --> 27:13.276
Entree, three cod, three Wellington.
(All) Yes, chef.

27:13.277 --> 27:16.279
(Announcer) Patrick on fish,
and Clemenza on meat...

27:16.280 --> 27:19.149
I need two and a half minutes.
Can you go on that? You got two minutes.

27:19.150 --> 27:21.385
(Announcer) Seem to be
in sync, and are hoping

27:21.386 --> 27:23.920
to keep the blue kitchen's
positive momentum going.

27:23.921 --> 27:26.223
We're communicating.
The energy level is great.

27:26.224 --> 27:27.391
And it's a good sign.

27:27.392 --> 27:29.593
I'm gonna go to the pass.

27:29.594 --> 27:32.462
[Bleep] me. It's not gonna
[bleep] make it, man.

27:32.463 --> 27:34.464
<i>I've got three cod
in the window.</i>

27:34.465 --> 27:36.066
Where's the rest of it?

27:36.067 --> 27:38.068
They weren't cooked
all the way through, chef.

27:38.069 --> 27:39.403
I said I'm going to the pass.

27:39.404 --> 27:41.238
Two cod and two Wellington!

27:41.239 --> 27:43.340
Why is this so difficult?

27:43.341 --> 27:47.277
(Announcer) While Clemenza and
Patrick start over on their entrees,

27:47.278 --> 27:50.380
the red team is finally ready
to go with appetizers

27:50.381 --> 27:51.848
for the table of firefighters.

27:51.849 --> 27:53.216
All they need are...

27:53.217 --> 27:54.851
Scallops, how long?
Four minutes.

27:54.852 --> 27:57.254
What?

27:57.255 --> 27:58.722
Stop.

27:58.723 --> 28:01.024
If there's people that aren't
pulling their weight

28:01.025 --> 28:03.860
on the line, I'm going to
take control of their station.

28:03.861 --> 28:06.296
I know I'm the leadoff hitter,
and if I don't get us on base,

28:06.297 --> 28:08.765
you know, we're never gonna touch home.
You ready?

28:08.766 --> 28:10.567
(Announcer)
Thanks to Christina...

28:10.568 --> 28:12.469
Scallops walking.
Finally. Service, please.

28:12.470 --> 28:15.672
(Announcer) Appetizers are leaving
the red kitchen at a rapid pace.

28:15.673 --> 28:17.340
Here is your lobster spaghetti.

28:17.341 --> 28:19.309
<i>It's all good, huh?
All good.</i>

28:19.310 --> 28:20.944
(Gordon) Service, please.

28:20.945 --> 28:22.379
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

28:22.380 --> 28:24.181
Three cod, three Wellington.
How long?

28:24.182 --> 28:25.415
How long are the cod?
Three minutes.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.583
How long, Clemenza?

28:26.584 --> 28:27.717
Three minutes. Not even.

28:27.718 --> 28:28.852
If we're at three minutes,

28:28.853 --> 28:31.121
why are we slicing already?

28:31.122 --> 28:32.823
Just taking off the end chop.

28:32.824 --> 28:34.424
You slice it now,
it's gonna bleed out.

28:34.425 --> 28:35.959
<i>[Bleep]!
Let's go, Clemenza.</i>

28:35.960 --> 28:38.228
I blew one [bleep], I'm gonna be
down one [bleep] Wellington now.

28:38.229 --> 28:39.896
Yes, I'm gonna be short
two Wellington,

28:39.897 --> 28:40.997
three Wellington,
I'm telling you.

28:40.998 --> 28:41.998
How many more you got?

28:41.999 --> 28:43.834
I got one, two...
that's it.

28:43.835 --> 28:45.135
(Announcer) While Clemenza
searches for Wellingtons...

28:45.136 --> 28:46.903
[Bleep]!

28:46.904 --> 28:48.705
(Announcer)
Back in the red kitchen...

28:48.706 --> 28:50.640
First entree. Firefighters.
One cod,

28:50.641 --> 28:52.609
two Wellington,
one New York strip!

28:52.610 --> 28:54.244
(All) Yes, chef.
(Announcer) Kimmie on meat...

28:54.245 --> 28:56.379
Four minutes.
Four minutes, I can walk.

28:56.380 --> 28:58.915
(Announcer) And Briana on fish
are ready to impress chef Ramsay

28:58.916 --> 29:00.784
with their first set
of entrees.

29:00.785 --> 29:03.153
How long?
Two cod, four minutes.

29:03.154 --> 29:05.422
This is my chance to show chef
that I can be a leader,

29:05.423 --> 29:06.490
and I'm on point.

29:06.491 --> 29:07.924
I'm ready to step it up.

29:07.925 --> 29:09.392
I'm about to walk, Bri.

29:09.393 --> 29:11.595
[Bleep].
What's up?

29:11.596 --> 29:12.796
<i>Did you burn it?
Yes.</i>

29:12.797 --> 29:14.564
[Bleep] me, dude!

29:14.565 --> 29:16.066
My strips that came out
were perfect.

29:16.067 --> 29:17.200
My Wellingtons were good.

29:17.201 --> 29:19.069
The fish isn't cooked right.

29:19.070 --> 29:22.038
I gotta re-fire
that [bleep] again.

29:22.039 --> 29:24.641
Ugh!

29:24.642 --> 29:26.610
Kimmie, she just
burned it again.

29:26.611 --> 29:29.746
We're gonna need more time.
Ugh!

29:29.747 --> 29:32.482
Oh, my [bleep], Briana,
just cook the fish right!

29:32.483 --> 29:36.753
Coming up in five seconds.
Walking down. Walking down.

29:36.754 --> 29:39.189
Cod. Right here.

29:39.190 --> 29:42.058
[Bleep], I've got a half portion
of [bleep] cod.

29:42.059 --> 29:45.729
Where's the other half gone?

29:45.730 --> 29:50.033
Stop! All of you...

29:50.034 --> 29:54.304
<i>That's barely a portion,
and where's that going?</i>

29:54.305 --> 29:56.473
[Bleep]!

29:56.474 --> 29:59.576
I didn't realize they
shrank down that much, chef.

29:59.577 --> 30:01.545
It's a bit like your brain.
Not only is it shrunk,

30:01.546 --> 30:03.647
but it's disappeared!

30:03.648 --> 30:08.118
Can I have two New York strip
and two full portions of cod!

30:08.119 --> 30:09.419
(All) Yes, chef.

30:09.420 --> 30:10.720
(Announcer)
While Briana and Kimmie

30:10.721 --> 30:12.222
start over on their entrees...

30:12.223 --> 30:13.957
Kimmie, I'm so sorry.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.425
(Announcer)
Back in the blue kitchen...

30:15.426 --> 30:16.793
[Bleep], overcooked!

30:16.794 --> 30:18.929
(Announcer)
Clemenza has just realized

30:18.930 --> 30:20.564
he has a big problem
on his hands.

30:20.565 --> 30:23.400
(Clemenza)
I don't have any more.

30:23.401 --> 30:27.437
U.S. marines. How long?
I'm in trouble. This is not good.

30:27.438 --> 30:29.072
Chef, I don't have any more.

30:29.073 --> 30:33.410
Say that again.
Chef, I don't have any more.

30:33.411 --> 30:37.314
Hey, [bleep] baby rhino
screws the marines!

30:37.315 --> 30:40.083
It's pathetic!

30:40.084 --> 30:41.885
<i>It's the U.S. marines!</i>

30:48.380 --> 30:50.481
(Announcer)
90 minutes into dinner service,

30:50.482 --> 30:53.717
the blue team still has
half their entrees to serve.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.920
Three cod, three Wellington.
How long?

30:55.921 --> 30:57.822
(Announcer) But Clemenza...
Chef, I don't have any more.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.657
Say that again.
Chef, I don't have any more.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.992
(Announcer)
Has run out of beef Wellingtons.

31:01.993 --> 31:05.830
Hey, [bleep] baby rhino
screws the marines!

31:05.831 --> 31:07.865
All right, let's go, you.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.568
Your [bleep] mess,
you get yourself out of it.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.536
I know it's gonna look
embarrassing,

31:12.537 --> 31:14.638
but [bleep] take him to the marines.
Yes, chef.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.275
Guys, unfortunately, tonight
we ran short on Wellington.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.512
Can we recommend a New York
strip steak for you guys?

31:21.513 --> 31:25.049
I had six marines with that
hardcore [bleep] eyeball look

31:25.050 --> 31:29.386
staring at me, and I'm, like,
"holy [bleep]!"

31:32.858 --> 31:34.225
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.327
Appreciate it.
Thank you, guys.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.895
I'm totally relieved.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.297
It's probably the biggest
relief of pressure

31:40.298 --> 31:42.633
I've had in my life.
We can sub the New York strip!

31:42.634 --> 31:45.302
Next, it's three New York strip,
three cod.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.538
Yes, chef. I'll make it happen,
chef. Let's go!

31:47.539 --> 31:49.240
(Announcer) While the men
get started on a new order

31:49.241 --> 31:51.008
for the table of marines,

31:51.009 --> 31:53.377
back in the red kitchen,
Briana...

31:53.378 --> 31:55.346
I'm walking with the cod.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.414
(Announcer) And Kimmie are
finally ready with their entrees

31:57.415 --> 31:58.883
for the table of firefighters.

31:58.884 --> 32:00.618
Good. [Bleep] Finally!

32:00.619 --> 32:02.386
(Announcer) All they need is...
Garnish!

32:02.387 --> 32:03.554
Both: Yes, chef.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.256
Garnish is not a hard station,

32:05.257 --> 32:06.657
but I feel a pressure
that I have to make sure

32:06.658 --> 32:07.892
it's perfect.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.426
Hot pan, chef.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.395
I don't want to be on that
chopping block ever again.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.831
Where's the dumplings?
Where's the dumplings?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.132
Coming, chef.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.134
Coming?
I'm sorry, chef.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.669
They're not ready yet?
No, chef.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.005
'Cause you forgot?
Yes, chef.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.339
Pathetic!

32:22.340 --> 32:25.309
"Rosh, where are the dumplings?"
"I forgot."

32:25.310 --> 32:27.044
<i>Really? Really?</i>

32:27.045 --> 32:30.347
Can I get two full portions
of cod

32:30.348 --> 32:33.317
<i>with the garnish?
(All) Yes, chef.</i>

32:35.153 --> 32:38.055
(Announcer) While the red team
waits on Roshni,

32:38.056 --> 32:40.124
back in the blue kitchen...

32:40.125 --> 32:42.459
Three cod, three New York strip!
U.S. marines. How long?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.929
(Announcer) Clemenza and Patrick...
I'm ready to go.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.598

Service, please.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.008

in the red kitchen...

33:12.991 --> 33:14.358
Hey, have you readied
any garnish?

33:14.359 --> 33:15.926
<i>Yes, chef.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.295
(Announcer)
Briana, Roshni, and Kimmie

33:18.296 --> 33:19.797
are hoping that
their third attempt

33:19.798 --> 33:22.833
at the firefighters' entrees
will prove to be the charm.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.501
Look at your face.
Why so distraught?

33:24.502 --> 33:25.736
[Bleep] hell.

33:25.737 --> 33:29.006
[Bleep] me.
The dumplings, raw.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.475
Hey, come here, all of you.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.310
Here's the big insult.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.312

Stone cold.

33:35.313 --> 33:39.850

They're cold. Stone cold.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.218

33:41.219 --> 33:43.120
Oh, Roshni!

33:43.121 --> 33:46.123
Dumplings? Come on, that
the easiest part of the dish.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.425
You can't even poach
a dumpling.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.961
I'm sorry, chef.
Brutal!

33:50.962 --> 33:52.930
Every chef has a bad day,

33:52.931 --> 33:54.999
but I'm not letting it
get the best of me.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.900
I'm ready to fight back,
and I'm gonna fight back.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.637
Kimmie, I can walk?
Yeah, walk, walk!

33:59.638 --> 34:01.271
This is the cod.
Excellent.

34:01.272 --> 34:03.240
You guys are communicating well.
Good job.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.377
Oh, [bleep].
Burnt underneath.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.780
I got raw meat here.
Yeah?

34:09.781 --> 34:13.150
Who cooked the Wellington?

34:13.150 --> 34:14.851
I did, chef.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.888
Kimmie... I got one
sort of rare,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.257

it's been a nightmare.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.870
Pathetic!

34:32.871 --> 34:35.072
Chef's definitely
about to explode.

Get out!

34:56.998 --> 34:59.232

After a miserable evening

34:59.233 --> 35:01.268
of repeated failures
on entrees...

35:03.471 --> 35:05.238
Chef Ramsay has had enough.

35:05.239 --> 35:08.008
[Bleep] off out of here!

35:08.009 --> 35:10.210
Get out! [Bleep].

35:10.211 --> 35:12.245
I cannot believe we
[bleep] that up, yet again.

35:12.246 --> 35:15.115
My pride's gone,
my dignity's gone.

35:15.116 --> 35:18.552
Done. How long is it gonna
take me to [bleep] rebuild that?

35:18.553 --> 35:20.253
Ugh!

35:20.254 --> 35:22.589
(Announcer) While the women are left
to contemplate their failure...

35:22.590 --> 35:24.090

Come on. Last table. Let's go!

35:24.091 --> 35:25.592

are poised to achieve

35:25.593 --> 35:27.761
a convincing victory.
We got this, guys. Keep going.

35:27.762 --> 35:30.163
How long? Ten seconds on
that last steak, chef.

35:30.164 --> 35:32.599
Quickly. Sorry, chef.
Last steak is up.

35:35.303 --> 35:37.904

35:37.905 --> 35:39.072
[Laughter] Yay!

35:39.073 --> 35:40.740
I like it.

35:40.741 --> 35:43.610
<i>That's right, baby.
(Gordon) Good work.</i>

35:46.714 --> 35:51.685
Another very difficult,
painful evening.

35:51.686 --> 35:53.119
But in a sea of [bleep],

Royce... Welcome back.
Thank you, chef.

36:00.027 --> 36:03.230
Christina, you finally
found your voice.

36:03.231 --> 36:04.531
Yes, chef.

36:04.532 --> 36:07.868
Unfortunately,
your team didn't gel.

36:07.869 --> 36:12.239
The losing team tonight,
obviously, is the women.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.940
You went so far backwards,

36:13.941 --> 36:16.543

any entrees out.</i>

36:16.544 --> 36:21.348
Ladies, get upstairs
and start thinking

36:21.349 --> 36:23.550
of which two should be up
for elimination.

36:23.551 --> 36:26.052
I can name six straight off.

36:26.053 --> 36:28.588
Piss off.
Yes, chef.

36:31.192 --> 36:32.926
As a team, we absolutely
let him down.

36:32.927 --> 36:34.861
We cooked like a bunch
of [bleep].

36:34.862 --> 36:36.296
We'll be lucky if
it's only one person

36:36.297 --> 36:37.364
going home tonight.

36:37.365 --> 36:38.999
Let's make this short
and sweet.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.569
Who's going up?

36:42.570 --> 36:43.870
I'm going up.

36:43.871 --> 36:45.672
I'm absolutely not giving up.

36:45.673 --> 36:47.541
I know that I'm a strong chef,

36:47.542 --> 36:50.210
and I think that my going home
would hurt the team.

36:50.211 --> 36:52.512
I just pray that
chef Ramsay believes me.

36:52.513 --> 36:57.517
Does everyone agree that
their one vote is for Barbie?

36:57.518 --> 36:58.718
Uh, sorry, for Briana?

36:58.719 --> 37:00.153
Yes.
Yes.

37:00.154 --> 37:02.255
Okay, done.

37:02.256 --> 37:04.324
Who's the other vote for?

37:04.325 --> 37:06.393
Who else got
the most yelled at?

37:06.394 --> 37:08.995
We're all worried.

37:08.996 --> 37:11.131
We know that one of us is going
home, and it's upsetting.

37:11.132 --> 37:14.234
Thank God nobody is really
voting for me.

37:14.235 --> 37:17.137
I'm gonna say Barbie because...

37:17.138 --> 37:19.372
I mean, like, I feel like
you were very quiet.

37:19.373 --> 37:22.842
I'm voting for Barbie, because
Barbie, like, [bleep] me.

<i>What are you talking about?
We all had a sucky night.</i>

37:26.280 --> 37:30.050
But somehow I'm a scapegoat
again.

37:30.051 --> 37:32.018
I'm not willing to accept this.

37:32.019 --> 37:34.654
I will have to vote for Dana.

37:34.655 --> 37:39.526
Yeah, Dana got crushed
off the bat.

37:39.527 --> 37:42.128
[Bleep] off, Barbie. I hope
you get sent home tonight.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.431
(Dana)
Barbie can't do anything right.

37:44.432 --> 37:46.666
I mean, she sent up scallops,
they were raw.

37:46.667 --> 37:49.569
Every night in service,
she has made critical mistakes.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.605
So I'm gonna keep voting
for Barbie

37:51.606 --> 37:53.940
as long as she
keeps messing up.

38:10.758 --> 38:12.759
Our first nominee is Briana.
