"The night was..."

02:18.388 --> 02:20.473
(thunder)

02:22.350 --> 02:25.394
"The night was..."

02:41.077 --> 02:43.287
"The night..."

03:10.523 --> 03:12.691
(grunts)

03:12.775 --> 03:15.069
The Phantom of the Novel...

03:15.152 --> 03:18.197
..is coming to haunt
the pages of Larry Donner.

03:27.331 --> 03:29.833
Jeez, what the hell am I doing?

03:35.756 --> 03:38.759
Hello, Op. Remember me?
Professor Blank?

03:38.842 --> 03:42.721
We're back. Well, I'm sure
you all know the name Margaret Donner.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.057
- Unless you live under a rock.
- No!

03:45.140 --> 03:50.270
Ladies and gentlemen, the author
of the best-selling novel "Hot Fire".

03:50.354 --> 03:54.983
- Author of the best-selling novel?
- You must be very proud of yourself.

03:55.067 --> 03:58.070
- Well, l... I am.
- The woman stole my book!

03:58.153 --> 04:01.281
- What's to be proud of?
-..and there's just you,...

04:01.365 --> 04:05.744
..you facing you in that mirror,
do you say "Margaret, you did it"?

04:06.328 --> 04:08.413
- Yes, I do.
- Slut!

04:08.497 --> 04:11.416
She's a slut! Look at her! Slut!

04:11.833 --> 04:15.879
- Hey! Hey, man, your wife's on TV!
- Ex-wife, Lester. Ex-wife.

04:15.962 --> 04:20.091
- She looks good!
- Criminals don't age. It's a common fact.

04:20.175 --> 04:23.386
- What the hell do you want?
- Something for a gig.

04:23.470 --> 04:27.349
- You got anything in green?
- You borrowed all my green.

04:27.432 --> 04:31.102
It is a lot more difficult for women
to get themselves published...

04:31.186 --> 04:34.397
How about women thieves, Oprah?
Big difference.

04:34.481 --> 04:38.234
I would say that, once I was divorced,...

04:38.318 --> 04:40.195
..blissfully divorced,...

04:40.278 --> 04:45.241
..a freedom overcame me, and I was
allowed to be the writer, the artist,...

04:45.325 --> 04:50.121
..that I was never allowed to be within
the confines of my prison-like marriage.

04:50.205 --> 04:53.708
Did you think about writing
when you were with this beast?

04:53.792 --> 04:55.919
- Well, I did. I did, yes.
- (laughter)

04:56.002 --> 04:59.088
Because he fancied himself
a sort of a hack writer.

04:59.172 --> 05:04.052
I watched him at the typewriter and
thought: Oh, God, I can do that in spades.

05:04.135 --> 05:05.512
Then did, clearly.

05:05.595 --> 05:08.806
How do you think he will feel now
about your success?

05:09.098 --> 05:12.894
- Frankly, I don't really care how he feels.
- (laughter)

05:12.977 --> 05:15.813
- Well, Margaret...
- (applause)

05:17.565 --> 05:20.818
So she stole your book.
Write another one and forget it.

05:20.902 --> 05:22.820
- I am writing.
- Oh, you're writing?

05:22.904 --> 05:25.490
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah, right! "The night was..."

05:26.282 --> 05:28.493
- The night was what?
- I just started.

05:28.576 --> 05:32.789
- You been on "The night was" since July.
- It takes place in the Yukon.

05:32.872 --> 05:35.875
..severed the ties. You live in Hawaii now.

05:35.958 --> 05:39.670
- Yes. I just adore a tropical climate.
- Look at those earrings, man!

05:39.754 --> 05:41.839
It's your money.

05:42.590 --> 05:45.968
How was it that you, Margaret Donner,...

05:46.052 --> 05:51.974
..produced such a brilliant piece of
writing in... just your first time out?

05:53.434 --> 05:56.646
Well, Oprah, I mean...
it's the story of my life.

05:56.729 --> 05:59.815
It's my life, Margaret! And I want it back!

05:59.899 --> 06:04.195
"Hot Fire", ladies and gentlemen. Thank
you so much for being on the show.

06:04.278 --> 06:07.281
- My pleasure.
- I want it back!

06:09.033 --> 06:11.118
- Owen!
- (thunder)

06:11.202 --> 06:13.078
Owen!

06:13.370 --> 06:15.247
Owen!

06:16.332 --> 06:20.252
Owen! Owen!

06:20.377 --> 06:23.422
- What?!
- Get me a soda with some ice in it!

06:25.215 --> 06:26.884
- Owen, hurry up!
- Momma...

06:26.967 --> 06:30.095
- Chop chop, Owen! Come on!
- All right!

06:34.808 --> 06:37.728
- You were writing a letter!
- No, Momma!

06:37.811 --> 06:42.274
You were writing to tell them to take me
away! You want them to take me away!

06:42.357 --> 06:46.779
I'm writin' a story for class, Momma!
I don't want 'em to take you away!

06:46.862 --> 06:49.364
- Yes, you do!
- Owen loves his momma!

06:49.448 --> 06:51.533
(mimics) "Owen loves his momma."

06:51.617 --> 06:55.787
(singsong) Owen loves his momma,
Owen loves his momma...

07:19.978 --> 07:22.481
- Hurry up with that soda!
- Coming, Momma.

07:22.564 --> 07:26.485
(mimics) "Coming, Momma."
I'm choking to death, you moron!

07:26.818 --> 07:29.988
- You're too damn slow!
- I'm sorry, Momma.

07:30.071 --> 07:32.532
(mimics) "I'm sorry, Momma."

07:32.616 --> 07:36.369
- Where are the salted nuts?
- The salted ones are no good for you.

07:36.453 --> 07:38.663
The unsalted ones make me choke!

07:48.923 --> 07:52.761
Aarrghhh!

07:56.681 --> 07:57.724
Momma!

07:59.851 --> 08:02.562
You clumsy poop! What'd you do that for?

08:08.860 --> 08:11.362
Come on, move it, lard-ass!

08:13.615 --> 08:15.700
Pick up every piece!

08:26.753 --> 08:28.254
"'Dive,...

08:28.338 --> 08:31.758
..dive!' yelled the captain
through the thing."

08:32.592 --> 08:38.264
"So the man who makes it dive pressed
a button or something and it dove,...

08:38.347 --> 08:41.683
..and the enemy was foiled again."

08:41.767 --> 08:45.563
"'Looks like we foiled them again'
said Dave."

08:45.646 --> 08:47.940
"'Yeah' said the captain."

08:48.399 --> 08:52.653
"'We foiled those bastards again,
didn't we, Dave?'"

08:53.195 --> 08:55.281
"'Yeah' said Dave."

08:56.240 --> 08:58.326
"The end."

08:59.410 --> 09:01.287
OK.

09:02.038 --> 09:05.041
Here we have all the elements of drama.

09:06.083 --> 09:10.421
We have the tension, the horror of war...

09:10.504 --> 09:15.926
Uh... Mrs Hazeltine, when you're writing
a novel that takes place on a submarine,...

09:16.010 --> 09:19.889
..it's not a bad idea to know
the name of the instrument...

09:19.972 --> 09:22.266
..that the captain speaks through.

09:22.349 --> 09:27.229
- I used to know that.
- And your similes... need a little work.

09:27.313 --> 09:31.692
"His guts oozed nice
like a melted malted."

09:32.985 --> 09:35.696
Well, it's, um... a little...

09:35.779 --> 09:38.157
- Too harsh?
- A tad.

09:38.615 --> 09:41.035
Otherwise it was, um...

09:41.118 --> 09:43.203
..very good, it was, uh...

09:43.287 --> 09:45.372
..very real.

09:52.796 --> 09:56.091
Here's another one.
This is a real classic by Mr Pinsky.

09:56.175 --> 09:59.928
It's entitled 100 Girls I'd Like to Pork.

10:01.722 --> 10:03.432
Pork?

10:03.724 --> 10:05.893
It's a coffee-table book.

10:06.685 --> 10:09.521
100 Girls I'd Like to... hm.

10:12.649 --> 10:14.651
"Chapter 1 : Kathleen Turner."

10:15.277 --> 10:19.156
"Chapter 2: Cybill Shepherd.
Chapter 3: Suzanne Pleshette."

10:20.157 --> 10:22.951
"Chapter 4: The Girl
in the Taco Commercial."

10:23.744 --> 10:28.331
"Chapter 5: The Woman in 4B.
Chapter 6: The Oriental Laker Girl."

10:28.415 --> 10:30.500
"Chapter 7: Chris..."

10:30.584 --> 10:33.044
Mr Pinsky, this is not literature.

10:33.128 --> 10:36.840
Well, you know,
I would put in photographs,...

10:36.923 --> 10:40.927
..a brief character sketch,
like a biography,...

10:41.011 --> 10:43.179
..and a nice dust jacket.

10:43.263 --> 10:47.767
- Mr Pinsky, what is this?
- It's... Iiterature. It's a fantasy.

10:47.851 --> 10:51.438
Like Melville. This is
my great white whale.

10:51.521 --> 10:55.108
- It's whacking material.
- lsn't that literature?

10:55.191 --> 10:59.696
How do you associate Moby Dick to a list
of women you'd like to have sex with?

10:59.779 --> 11:02.574
- I think it's brave.
- (Mrs Hazeltine) He's vulgar.

11:02.657 --> 11:04.868
- They said Twain was.
- I'm saying he is.

11:04.951 --> 11:07.579
- I think you're vulgar.
- You're a no-talent shit.

11:07.662 --> 11:10.832
- Maybe I should change the title.
- (man) I like the title.

11:10.915 --> 11:13.543
- (bell)
- OK, I'll see you Wednesday, class.

11:13.626 --> 11:17.213
Good work today. Remember,
a writer writes... always.

12:00.089 --> 12:01.340
Argh! Oh!

12:01.424 --> 12:03.634
- This is your tie.
- Oh, God.

12:03.718 --> 12:06.595
- You dropped it.
- Oh. How'd that get in there?

12:07.471 --> 12:10.641
It got wet. I was afraid it would be ruined.

12:11.434 --> 12:12.685
Thanks.

12:12.768 --> 12:14.854
- Hi. I'm Owen.
- I know.

12:14.937 --> 12:17.356
Why didn't you read my story in class?

12:18.274 --> 12:21.610
- Your story?
- Yeah. Murder at my Friend Harry's.

12:21.694 --> 12:24.029
Why didn't you read it?

12:24.113 --> 12:27.074
- I did.
- You did? What'd you think of it?

12:28.159 --> 12:30.870
It's raining, lrwin.
Can't we discuss it tomorrow?

12:30.953 --> 12:33.789
Owen. Didn't you like it?

12:33.873 --> 12:37.293
- Well... no. No, I didn't.
- Why not?

12:37.459 --> 12:40.879
It was three pages long.
It was a murder mystery...

12:40.963 --> 12:44.341
..that, by the way, was no big trick
in finding the murderer.

12:44.425 --> 12:47.261
- What gave it away?
- You only had two characters,...

12:47.344 --> 12:50.264
..one of which was dead on page two!

12:50.347 --> 12:52.599
Well, one guy killed the other guy.

12:53.392 --> 12:56.603
- It wasn't motivated!
- Sure it was.

12:56.687 --> 12:59.523
A guy in a hat killed
the other guy in a hat.

13:00.482 --> 13:02.568
I have to go now, Owen.

13:08.282 --> 13:09.616
Thanks.

13:09.700 --> 13:13.412
- (bleep)
- Hi, Beth. It's me. It's, uh... 10.30...

13:13.495 --> 13:16.081
..and I did it again. I'm sorry.

13:16.164 --> 13:19.626
It's just that... Margaret was on the...

13:19.710 --> 13:22.337
Oy, there I go again. It's...

13:22.421 --> 13:25.549
I'll... Look, I'm sorry. That's all. Bye.

13:26.383 --> 13:27.843
(tuts)

13:31.805 --> 13:34.599
So Margaret's a big star. That's life.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.561
This is life, too.
That goes on, this goes on.

13:40.313 --> 13:41.439
Hm.

13:41.606 --> 13:43.650
The night was hot.

13:43.733 --> 13:46.778
Wait, no. The night... The night was...

13:47.529 --> 13:49.823
..humid! The night was humid.

13:49.906 --> 13:52.784
No, wait. Hot. Hot! The night was hot.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.287
The night was hot and wet. Wet and hot.

13:55.370 --> 13:59.666
The night was wet and hot... hot and wet...
That's humid. The night was humid.

13:59.749 --> 14:03.712
Maybe the night isn't humid.
Maybe... the night isn't humid.

14:03.795 --> 14:08.633
Maybe it was humid in the morning and
at night it was cold. That gives you fog.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.427
Ha! The night was foggy.

14:10.677 --> 14:14.848
The night... The night was...
The night was...

14:14.931 --> 14:18.476
The night... The night was dry,
yet it was raining.

14:19.310 --> 14:21.229
The... The... The...

14:21.312 --> 14:23.731
The streets were wet,...

14:23.815 --> 14:26.943
..but the night... was as bright...

14:27.026 --> 14:28.945
..as... the...

14:29.028 --> 14:33.324
..earrings in Margaret Donner's ears!
My God! I'm goin' outta my mind!

14:33.408 --> 14:34.826
Fuck it!

14:34.909 --> 14:38.037
The... night... was... humid!

14:38.663 --> 14:40.248
That's it and that's all.

14:40.331 --> 14:41.708
(grunts)

14:49.632 --> 14:54.178
Stop it, dammit!
I got a wax ball in my ear. Get it out.

14:55.388 --> 14:58.766
- Momma!
- You were writing to her, weren't you?

14:58.850 --> 15:01.894
Don't start that again, Momma.
And don't hit me!

15:01.978 --> 15:05.731
- You love her.
- There's no "her", Momma.

15:07.066 --> 15:11.529
- You were writing a letter.
- I'm writin' a story for class, Momma.

15:11.612 --> 15:14.448
- I take a class. I take a nice class.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:14.532 --> 15:18.911
- And I'm gonna be a writer some day.
- You know how that typing upsets me.

15:18.994 --> 15:21.580
I'm sorry, Momma. A writer writes.

15:21.664 --> 15:24.708
You're gonna be nothing.
You're gonna be nothing.

15:24.792 --> 15:29.839
You'll never get to first base.
All you do is type, type, type, type, type!

15:31.048 --> 15:34.093
You sit there typing all day
like a fat little pigeon.

15:34.176 --> 15:37.054
You won't ever hear it again, Momma.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.931
I promise.

15:42.768 --> 15:45.521
Aarrghhh!

15:45.771 --> 15:48.565
- Momma...
- I think you got it, sonny.

15:48.649 --> 15:51.986
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Owen baby.

15:54.905 --> 15:58.033
- I know, Momma.
- Owen, my little baby.

15:58.117 --> 16:01.245
- I know.
- Owen, my little baby boy.

16:03.038 --> 16:06.875
(Owen) And even though
he was mortally wounded,...

16:06.959 --> 16:09.920
..the guy in the hat got up...

16:10.003 --> 16:13.757
..and pulled himself up and...

16:14.341 --> 16:18.720
..staggered out into the dark night...

16:19.888 --> 16:22.432
..Iike a milkman...

16:22.516 --> 16:25.686
..going out on his route.

16:26.478 --> 16:28.021
(man) There he is, Owen.

16:28.105 --> 16:31.400
- Professor Donner...
- Not now, Owen. Another time.

16:34.236 --> 16:35.862
- Beth...
- Don't bother.

16:35.946 --> 16:38.907
- I gotta talk to you.
- You're 16 hours late.

16:39.616 --> 16:42.953
And I'm sorry. It's just that...
she was on the television.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.330
Margaret was on TV
and my mind went nuts.

16:45.413 --> 16:48.875
My mind went crazy. I saw
nothing but hate and death.

16:48.959 --> 16:52.462
And I'm sorry, and I did call.
I called you around 10.30.

16:52.546 --> 16:55.507
- Where were you?
- Did you think I'd stay in all night...

16:55.590 --> 16:57.676
..staring at my tandoori chicken?

16:59.052 --> 17:02.639
I know you're angry
and... you have every right to be angry.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.766
It's just that l...

17:09.270 --> 17:12.147
- It's my class.
- Ah. How do you do?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.983
(all) Hi.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.028
- What's your name?
- Beth Ryan.

17:17.112 --> 17:19.155
She teaches anthropology.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.740
Beth... Ryan?

17:22.282 --> 17:24.786
Don't even think about it.

17:24.868 --> 17:26.954
(man) Hang in there, Pinsky.

17:30.792 --> 17:35.421
Come on. I'm sorry. Do you know that
we are this far away from having a date?

17:35.505 --> 17:36.965
We're just this far.

17:37.048 --> 17:39.175
- (as Beth) Hello, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

17:39.258 --> 17:43.763
- You probably made tandoori chicken.
- (as Beth) Come on in, Larry. Oh...

17:43.846 --> 17:47.517
Come on, gimme a second chance.
What do you say? Come on!

17:47.600 --> 17:51.562
- I can't believe I'm saying this. Yes.
- Yeah? Great!

17:51.646 --> 17:54.023
Professor Donner,
I saw your wife on Oprah!

17:54.107 --> 17:55.650
Ex-wife. Ex!

17:56.526 --> 17:58.069
What's with him?

18:00.071 --> 18:02.156
(sighs) I can't get over this.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.742
- Why?
- Why? Why?!

18:04.825 --> 18:07.328
She steals my book! OK?

18:07.411 --> 18:11.874
- She goes on national television...
- I'm not gonna sit here and be barked at.

18:12.416 --> 18:15.336
Wait. Listen to me, Beth. The problem is...

18:15.419 --> 18:18.965
..I can't write. I'm dead inside.
I have no passion.

18:19.048 --> 18:23.427
You have passion. When you talk
about Margaret, you have passion.

18:23.511 --> 18:25.763
Slut!

18:26.222 --> 18:28.307
No, my ex-wife is a major slut.

18:28.391 --> 18:30.684
- But you're not a slut.
- Thank you!

18:30.768 --> 18:35.981
I'm talking about passion!
It's selfless, committed, overflowing!

18:36.065 --> 18:38.150
Not hate and murder!

18:38.234 --> 18:41.403
And slut! I hate her! I wish she was dead!

18:52.539 --> 18:53.707
Chill out.

18:55.793 --> 18:57.503
Thank you.

18:57.586 --> 18:59.463
It's so beautiful!

19:00.339 --> 19:02.925
It's very good, Phil. Very, very good.

19:03.008 --> 19:07.554
Forty yards of Naugahyde, a girl
and a dream. What can I say? It's...

19:07.638 --> 19:10.015
Well, I wrote it just like I lived it.

19:10.099 --> 19:13.769
Which is what you've been
teaching us: to write what we know.

19:13.852 --> 19:18.190
It's very good. It'll blow the lid off
the upholstery business as we know it.

19:18.273 --> 19:20.567
- Thank you.
- OK.

19:22.444 --> 19:27.658
Next is Murder at my Friend Harry's
by Owen... Lift.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.290
"Chapter 1. The night was humid."

19:36.958 --> 19:39.169
Class dismissed.

19:39.252 --> 19:42.172
I have an enormous headache in my eye.

19:57.562 --> 19:59.648
Yuck.

20:09.866 --> 20:12.160
OWEN

20:15.914 --> 20:17.999
(sighs)

20:44.692 --> 20:46.736
(car door closes)

20:56.120 --> 21:00.458
(Larry) I'm so sorry about the cafeteria.
It was Norman Bates in concert.

21:00.541 --> 21:04.253
It's just that I see her and l...

21:04.337 --> 21:07.048
- You wanna kill her.
- Metaphorically, yes.

21:07.131 --> 21:09.634
Specifically, without a doubt.

21:11.636 --> 21:15.139
- I'm glad you called.
- Me, too.

21:15.223 --> 21:17.016
I like trains.

21:17.099 --> 21:20.937
Every great romance or mystery
has a train in it.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.564
- Is this gonna be a great romance?
- Could be.

21:23.648 --> 21:27.777
We have a train, we have the moon,
we have compatible body parts.

21:28.694 --> 21:31.530
- Would you like to kiss me?
- I don't know.

21:31.614 --> 21:33.699
You don't know?

21:36.410 --> 21:38.704
Oh, you're so sweet, Beth.

21:38.788 --> 21:41.248
Oh, Larry, would you like to date me?

21:41.332 --> 21:46.754
- This isn't a date?
- Mmm... I was speaking euphemistically.

21:46.837 --> 21:50.090
- So you're... you're saying...?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:50.174 --> 21:53.510
So you're saying...?
Yeah, you are. I can feel that.

21:56.138 --> 22:00.017
- You're saying no?
- Kids are gonna sit here tomorrow.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.186
Awww...

22:03.812 --> 22:06.398
- I wanna make love to you, Beth.
- Oh, Larry...

22:06.482 --> 22:08.776
Sometime in the very near future.

22:08.859 --> 22:11.403
- Huh?
- I can't.

22:11.487 --> 22:13.655
- What?
- I have writer's block.

22:13.739 --> 22:16.533
- Everywhere?
- Yeah. It's no good. I can't.

22:18.911 --> 22:22.581
- On the train?
- Oh, I wanna ring the bell.

22:22.664 --> 22:24.708
(moans and sighs)

22:29.338 --> 22:31.423
- (Beth) Oh, take me, Casey.
- Who?

22:31.506 --> 22:34.676
- Take me, Casey.
- I'm taking you, I'm taking you.

22:40.891 --> 22:42.976
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

22:45.020 --> 22:47.814
Do you know Owen?
This is Owen. Owen is a dead man.

22:47.898 --> 22:51.485
- Did I come at a bad time?
- Owen... I'm dating.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.821
You read it, right? My story?

22:54.905 --> 22:56.990
- Yes.
- Good.

22:58.033 --> 23:01.369
Owen, you cannot follow me around
asking me questions.

23:01.453 --> 23:05.832
This stuff belongs in the classroom.
Not on my time. Do you understand me?

23:06.666 --> 23:08.668
Oh.

23:08.752 --> 23:10.837
I'm sorry.

23:11.546 --> 23:13.798
Good night, Miss Ryan.

23:17.135 --> 23:19.137
- Did you like it?
- No!

23:22.682 --> 23:24.350
(ringing)

23:24.976 --> 23:27.062
(Owen) Why didn't you like it?

23:27.353 --> 23:32.150
Because in a novel people have to have
more of a reason to commit a murder.

23:32.233 --> 23:36.279
If they just do it because they're crazy,
it's not strong enough for a novel.

23:36.362 --> 23:40.700
You mean, if someone ruined you
permanently, then you could murder 'em?

23:40.783 --> 23:45.288
Yes. Which brings us to the second point.
The motive: you have to eliminate it.

23:45.997 --> 23:50.376
- Eliminate the motive.
- Correct. I'll give you an example.

23:50.460 --> 23:53.212
My ex-wife. I hate her guts, right?

23:53.296 --> 23:58.092
Yeah. I overheard you in the cafeteria.
She really ruined you.

23:58.176 --> 24:02.513
Yes, she did. And I hate her with
a passion. But I would never murder her.

24:03.389 --> 24:05.933
- You'd get caught.
- Absolutely right.

24:06.017 --> 24:09.896
I would get caught because
I have a motive and people know that.

24:10.771 --> 24:13.399
I got a similar problem with my momma.

24:14.275 --> 24:19.488
Well, look at this, Owen. This is amazing.
You and I have something in common.

24:20.156 --> 24:23.409
- We do?
- Absolutely. Think about what I'm saying.

24:23.492 --> 24:26.996
And then you just draw on
your own personal experiences.

24:27.079 --> 24:31.375
You mean... how do you murder
and not get caught?

24:31.459 --> 24:33.961
So how do you not get caught?

24:34.795 --> 24:37.423
Owen? How do you not get caught?

24:37.506 --> 24:41.010
By eliminating the motive
and establishing an alibi.

24:42.470 --> 24:47.349
- How?
- I can't tell you everything. I don't know.

24:47.433 --> 24:50.644
- Go see a Hitchcock film.
- Wanna go to the movies with me?

24:50.728 --> 24:54.398
No, I don't wanna go to the movies.
It's real late and l...

24:54.481 --> 24:57.776
I'm gonna go now.
You're gonna be fine. OK?

24:59.236 --> 25:02.656
- Thank you, Professor Donner.
- Good night, Owen.

25:04.992 --> 25:07.286
Eliminate the motive.

25:08.203 --> 25:09.788
Eliminate...

25:09.872 --> 25:11.957
Elim...

25:12.041 --> 25:14.126
Eliminate the motive.

25:15.502 --> 25:17.588
Motive.

25:18.964 --> 25:20.841
Hitchcock.

25:21.425 --> 25:24.136
Let's say that you'd like
to get rid ofyour wife.

25:24.470 --> 25:26.763
Let's say that you have
a very good reason.

25:26.847 --> 25:29.892
- No, let's not...
- No, no. Let's say.

25:29.975 --> 25:33.687
You'd be afraid to kill her.
You know why? You'd get caught.

25:33.770 --> 25:37.107
And what would trip you up? The motive.

25:37.608 --> 25:42.112
Ah. Now here's my idea.
It's so simple, too.

25:42.696 --> 25:46.283
Two fellows meet accidentally,
like you and me.

25:46.366 --> 25:50.037
Each one has somebody
that he'd like to get rid of.

25:50.495 --> 25:53.415
So... they swap murders.

25:53.874 --> 25:57.794
- Swap murders? (laughs)
- Each fellow does the other's murder.

25:57.878 --> 26:01.965
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a total stranger.

26:02.257 --> 26:05.468
Like... you do my murder, I do yours.

26:06.386 --> 26:09.347
Your wife, my father. Crisscross.

26:09.431 --> 26:13.059
Some people are better off dead.
Each one has murdered a total stranger.

26:13.143 --> 26:16.521
They swap murders.
You do my murder. Crisscross.

26:16.605 --> 26:17.647
I do yours.

26:17.731 --> 26:20.191
They swap murders. Crisscross.

26:20.525 --> 26:22.777
Crisscross.

26:24.154 --> 26:28.950
(Beth) "Choo-Choo Charlie said
to himself: I think I can. I know I can."

26:29.034 --> 26:33.788
"He opened up his throttle and pushed
and pulled and pushed and pulled...

26:33.872 --> 26:38.626
..and it spluttered some more
and then... and then he... and then..."

26:42.297 --> 26:44.716
- How's that blockage problem?
- All aboard!

26:44.799 --> 26:46.593
- (Beth) Woo-woo!
- (phone rings)

26:46.676 --> 26:48.761
(Beth) No, no. Don't. Don't.

26:49.470 --> 26:53.099
- I'm buying a gun, Owen.
- You must wonder what happened to me.

26:53.182 --> 26:56.477
- Uh... no, not at all.
- I saw that movie.

26:56.561 --> 26:57.895
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

26:57.979 --> 27:01.315
I know now what you tried to tell me,
Professor Donner.

27:01.399 --> 27:02.942
- Oh, good.
- Crisscross.

27:03.026 --> 27:04.569
(Momma) Owen!

27:04.652 --> 27:08.114
- I'll call you in a few days, pal.
- Take your time, Owen. OK?

27:08.197 --> 27:10.533
- Bye.
- Owen!

27:11.367 --> 27:13.911
- Coming, Momma!
- Who were you talking to?

27:13.995 --> 27:17.790
- I just called the weather.
- You were talking to a machine?

27:21.377 --> 27:24.005
Two minutes ago
you were my agent, and now...

27:24.088 --> 27:26.966
Larry, I'm sorry.
That's the way the mop flops.

27:27.049 --> 27:30.094
After seven years I get
"That's the way the mop flops"?

27:30.177 --> 27:34.140
Larry, you must feel like this is
the lowest point of your entire life.

27:34.223 --> 27:37.893
Arnie, what are you doing?
Don't bend the fern. Fluff it!

27:37.977 --> 27:42.064
How, as a human being, can you give up
on somebody after seven years?

27:42.148 --> 27:47.111
Larry, this is a whole other agency.
Besides, you've never written anything.

27:47.194 --> 27:49.280
What about Hot Fire?

27:49.905 --> 27:54.034
This may be a tad bit disturbing, but
we've just signed your wife on as a client.

27:54.118 --> 27:57.705
Get me a doctor, Joel.
I'm having a heart attack.

27:57.788 --> 28:00.165
The book sold two million copies! Arnie...

28:00.249 --> 28:03.210
But I wrote that and you know that!
Arnie knows that!

28:03.294 --> 28:06.255
Margaret couldn't write
her name in the snow!

28:06.338 --> 28:10.676
Larry, for seven years I've given you
assignments. I've made your deals.

28:10.759 --> 28:14.930
And for seven years
you didn't want to "compromise your art"!

28:15.014 --> 28:19.101
Oh, boy. It is just like an agent
to think that a writer can't be an artist.

28:19.184 --> 28:22.563
- Don't change the subject. Where was l?
- You were letting me go.

28:22.646 --> 28:23.731
Thank you.

28:23.814 --> 28:27.484
For four years you've been writing
a novel no one has ever seen.

28:27.568 --> 28:31.864
So you get the shaft from your wife.
It's another excuse for not writing.

28:31.947 --> 28:37.452
Well, go ahead, Larry! Go! Go to Mexico!
Write your heart out! Andele, arriba!

28:37.536 --> 28:40.289
But I handle writers, Larry, not artists.

28:40.372 --> 28:43.417
You go be an artist.
Let the rest of the world make a living.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.837
Here. It's my favourite fuchsia.
Live and be well.

29:09.276 --> 29:11.695
That's the house. This is good here.

29:14.990 --> 29:19.077
- I'll be right back. I'm gonna visit my aunt.
- OK, bro.

29:58.408 --> 30:00.994
- (object drops)
- Oh, shit.

30:33.025 --> 30:35.403
(  Hawaiian music)

30:43.369 --> 30:45.454
Why, Mr Lopez.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.504
Can I borrow that... towel?

30:59.802 --> 31:01.887
My big Chihuahua.

31:03.848 --> 31:05.933
- Oh!
- (Mr Lopez growls)

31:06.016 --> 31:08.102
(Margaret laughs)

31:10.271 --> 31:12.356
Grrr! Ruff, ruff!

31:17.820 --> 31:19.905
Ruff, ruff! Ruff! Grrr!

31:23.867 --> 31:25.953
(phone rings)

31:26.036 --> 31:28.122
Ruff, ruff, ruff!

31:33.627 --> 31:35.712
- Ruff! Ruff!
- (Margaret moans)

31:37.422 --> 31:39.508
(phone still ringing)

31:42.970 --> 31:45.055
- Ruff, ruff!
- Hello?

31:45.681 --> 31:48.183
Oh, hi, Joel. It's my agent.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.352
- Ruff!
- My agente.

31:51.979 --> 31:53.814
How's LA, darling?

31:53.897 --> 31:57.442
Oh, nothing much. I'm having
a little trouble with the... gardener.

31:57.526 --> 32:00.153
- Ruff... ruff...
- What sound, sweetie?

32:00.237 --> 32:02.322
Oh, that's the... the TV.

32:02.406 --> 32:05.075
- Ruff! Ru-ruff!
- Uh... Old Yeller.

32:06.243 --> 32:08.412
Yes, I know they shot him in the end.

32:09.371 --> 32:11.456
Huh? Yes, darling.

32:11.540 --> 32:15.293
I'm aware of the book signing
tonight... in Maui.

32:16.378 --> 32:18.505
I'll be there. Kiss, kiss.

32:23.218 --> 32:25.679
(growling and moans ofpleasure)

32:54.707 --> 32:56.334
(motor starts)

32:57.252 --> 32:59.337
- (toots horn)
- Bye, Mr Lopez.

33:14.936 --> 33:17.021
(  Hawaiian music)

33:20.983 --> 33:23.069
Last boat to Maui!

34:02.399 --> 34:04.735
This is my first trip to the islands.

34:15.496 --> 34:18.581
(sings along with music)

34:53.283 --> 34:54.952
Oh!

34:56.036 --> 34:57.913
Oh, my God!

35:20.477 --> 35:22.896
(scream merging with laughter)

35:31.821 --> 35:33.907
The night...

35:34.074 --> 35:36.618
..was...n't.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.954
Oy.

35:42.332 --> 35:46.753
There's probably halibut right here
who could write better than me.

35:50.465 --> 35:53.176
Boy. The night was...

35:56.221 --> 35:58.765
If you got a line, fish, just yell it out.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.976
I'm up for grabs.

36:07.523 --> 36:09.817
- (engine fails to start)
- Perfect.

36:14.155 --> 36:16.240
(sighs)

36:17.325 --> 36:20.036
(faraway phone ringing)

36:25.208 --> 36:27.293
(phone still ringing)

36:33.966 --> 36:36.594
What about Brenda Lee?
You like Brenda Lee?

36:36.677 --> 36:38.763
- The jockey?
- No.

36:41.015 --> 36:43.100
(ringing)

36:45.061 --> 36:47.563
- Cloudy.
- (Owen) Aloha.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.192
- What?
- I said aloha.

36:51.567 --> 36:53.653
- Hello.
- Professor Donner?

36:54.945 --> 36:56.614
- Hello?
- Hello!

36:58.532 --> 37:01.118
- Hello.
- Professor Donner, stay by the phone.

37:01.202 --> 37:03.621
I don't want 'em
to be able to trace the call.

37:03.704 --> 37:04.997
(dialling tone)

37:13.339 --> 37:15.424
(groans)

37:16.550 --> 37:18.636
(phone rings)

37:19.595 --> 37:21.764
- Who is this?
- Professor Donner?

37:23.098 --> 37:25.684
- Aloha! Hello!
- Who is this?

37:25.768 --> 37:27.853
It's Owen!

37:29.313 --> 37:31.732
- Owen?
- Yeah, from class!

37:31.815 --> 37:33.901
What do you want?

37:34.610 --> 37:37.946
It's done. You want anything from Hawaii?

37:39.156 --> 37:41.658
- Hawaii?
- Wiki-wiki.

37:41.742 --> 37:43.827
Aloha 'oe

37:43.911 --> 37:48.040
- What are you doing in Hawaii?
- Crisscross. You know.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.044
Owen, I'm hanging up on you now.

37:52.336 --> 37:55.214
Oh, yeah, right! I got ya!
Boy, are you smart!

38:01.970 --> 38:03.513
(phone rings)

38:03.889 --> 38:09.269
She didn't feel a thing.
I know how important that is to you.

38:09.603 --> 38:11.688
- Who?
- Your wife.

38:12.731 --> 38:16.485
She had a little trouble walkin',
but that was from the gardener.

38:16.568 --> 38:20.447
- You saw my wife?
- She was kind of a tart, Larry.

38:20.530 --> 38:23.617
But I can see why you married her.
She was very beautiful.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.286
Owen, you stay away from my wife.

38:26.369 --> 38:28.455
(Owen hangs up)

38:31.875 --> 38:33.710
(phone rings)

38:33.793 --> 38:37.547
Did you hear what I said, Owen?
You stay away from my wife.

38:37.631 --> 38:41.843
- I told you, it's done. Nobody saw.
- What the hell are you talking about?

38:41.926 --> 38:44.554
Crisscross, like in the movie. Done!

38:45.055 --> 38:48.475
Owen, what the hell
did you do to my wife?

38:48.558 --> 38:50.894
I... I don't wanna say on the phone.

38:50.977 --> 38:54.105
All I can tell you is
that I killed her last night.

38:54.606 --> 38:56.357
(dialling tone)

38:56.441 --> 38:58.735
My God! Oh, my God.

38:59.319 --> 39:01.404
Oh, my God.

39:02.405 --> 39:03.448
(phone rings)

39:03.531 --> 39:06.618
Owen, what the hell did you do?
Tell me the truth.

39:06.701 --> 39:10.205
Meet me tonight at 7.30 at
Mulholland Drive and Cahuenga Pass.

39:10.288 --> 39:13.958
- We'll discuss your end ofthe bargain.
- What are you talking about?

39:14.042 --> 39:16.711
- You gotta kill my mother.
- Kill your mother?!

39:16.794 --> 39:19.297
7.30, Cahuenga Pass. Crisscross.

39:19.380 --> 39:21.466
- Owen, l...
- (Owen hangs up)

39:21.841 --> 39:23.843
Crisscross... Criss...

39:23.926 --> 39:28.014
Holy shit. He did it.
He did it! The little bastard did it!

39:28.097 --> 39:32.101
He killed my wi... No, he didn't do it.
He couldn't poss... No, he didn't do it.

39:32.185 --> 39:34.812
I'll call her up, call her up on the phone.

39:34.896 --> 39:38.399
She'll answer the phone,
I'll hang up, and she won't be dead.

39:38.483 --> 39:40.568
That's it and that's all.

39:44.697 --> 39:46.782
(phone rings)

39:50.995 --> 39:55.833
Come on, come on, Margaret. Answer
the phone. Answer the phone, Margaret.

39:56.250 --> 39:59.295
Why the hell isn't she
answering the phone?

39:59.378 --> 40:03.424
Because she's dead. That's why
she's not answering the phone.

40:03.507 --> 40:06.385
You don't answer the phone
when you're dead!

40:08.345 --> 40:11.640
They're gonna think I did it.
They're gonna think that I did it!

40:11.724 --> 40:14.977
Why would they think that I did it?
Because I hate her guts!

40:15.060 --> 40:17.938
That's why they'll think
that I did it. My God...

40:18.898 --> 40:20.566
I have no alibi.

40:20.649 --> 40:23.777
Lester! I was with you yesterday! Lester!

40:27.907 --> 40:32.369
- I was with you yesterday, right, Lester?
- Right. And now I'm with Ms Gladstone.

40:32.745 --> 40:35.122
I left the club at one.
I couldn't have done it!

40:35.205 --> 40:39.001
That's right. You couldn't have done it.
Close the door on your way out.

40:39.084 --> 40:43.338
I couldn't have gone to Hawaii and back
in that time. So what am I worried about?

40:43.422 --> 40:47.843
That's what I'd like to know. Hawaii
and back? No way, man. You're cool.

40:47.926 --> 40:53.015
Well... Now, if he left the club at one,
he could catch the three o'clock flight.

40:53.098 --> 40:56.518
You could be in Hawaii by five,
given the three-hour time change.

40:56.602 --> 40:59.521
- She's got a point.
- You could spend four hours there...

40:59.605 --> 41:02.316
..and still catch the last flight out by ten.

41:02.399 --> 41:05.903
- That's true.
- You'd arrive at LAX by 6am.

41:05.986 --> 41:10.198
An hour on the freeway...
You'd be home by seven.

41:10.282 --> 41:13.702
Whatever it is, you're fuckin' guilty, man.

41:13.785 --> 41:16.413
Meet Senior Flight Supervisor Gladstone.

41:16.496 --> 41:20.208
Hi. Pleased to meet you. Listen,
I've got a flight schedule in here.

41:20.292 --> 41:22.878
- I was on a rock!
- A rock?

41:22.961 --> 41:26.590
They're gonna think I did it!
I'm all motive and no alibi!

41:26.673 --> 41:28.842
I have no alibi! Motives are no problem.

41:28.925 --> 41:31.553
I'm up to my ass in motives.
I'm majoring in motives.

41:31.636 --> 41:36.099
Alibi, nowhere near my neighbourhood.
But motives: whooo-ooh!

41:36.183 --> 41:40.353
- I gotta go! Can I borrow your car?
- Sure, man. The keys are on the table...

41:40.437 --> 41:43.189
..next to the door. Goodbye.

41:43.940 --> 41:46.151
I gotta find Beth.

41:47.485 --> 41:50.488
What am I doing?
What the hell am I doing?!

41:50.572 --> 41:53.450
She's not dead.
I'm crazy. I'm a crazy man.

41:53.533 --> 41:56.286
She is not dead. He didn't kill her.

41:57.537 --> 42:01.708
News from Hawaii: Novelist Margaret
Donner is missing and presumed dead.

42:02.834 --> 42:05.628
- According to the police...
- Holy Christ!

42:05.712 --> 42:08.131
I'm not crazy! She's presumed!

42:08.214 --> 42:12.635
She was last seen boarding a boat
to Maui. She disappeared along route.

42:12.719 --> 42:16.306
- A search is on for the body.
- Margaret is dead! Poor Margaret!

42:16.389 --> 42:19.809
She is the renowned author
of the best-selling novel "Hot Fire".

42:19.893 --> 42:23.229
That slut! She is a slut! Slut!

42:23.313 --> 42:25.606
Foul play has not been ruled out.

42:26.482 --> 42:27.817
I'm gonna fry!

42:27.900 --> 42:29.986
(  didgeridoo playing)

42:31.404 --> 42:32.864
(door shuts)

42:33.406 --> 42:35.491
I'm in really deep shit, Beth.

42:35.575 --> 42:38.703
Ah. Look who's decided
to breeze back into my life.

42:39.162 --> 42:41.747
- I gotta talk to you.
- You have to talk to me?

42:41.831 --> 42:46.169
You don't return my calls or get in touch.
But hey, you need something from me?

42:47.712 --> 42:49.797
Make yourself at home. Have a seat.

42:49.881 --> 42:52.300
Can I offer you something? A cool drink?

42:52.383 --> 42:55.011
Would you listen to me?
I'm in a lot of trouble!

42:55.094 --> 42:57.430
- I'm on the edge of my seat.
- It's Margaret.

42:57.513 --> 42:59.515
Don't tell me! She's come back.

42:59.599 --> 43:02.101
- She's...
- Pregnant, put on weight...

43:02.184 --> 43:04.478
She's dead!

43:04.562 --> 43:06.147
Oh, God.

43:06.230 --> 43:08.941
- It's awful.
- Larry, I'm sorry.

43:10.609 --> 43:13.571
- Did she suffer?
- He said she didn't feel a thing.

43:13.654 --> 43:15.156
- Her doctor?
- Her killer.

43:15.239 --> 43:18.868
- She was killed?!
- She's dead. It works that way.

43:18.951 --> 43:21.829
Wait! Did the police find a clue
or have a motive or...

43:21.912 --> 43:26.500
If there was a motive, the fat little bastard
never would've killed her! Don't you see?

43:26.584 --> 43:29.003
Eliminate the motive, establish an alibi.

43:29.378 --> 43:32.882
- Just like I told him!
- Just like you told him?!

43:32.965 --> 43:36.719
- We were speaking hypothetically.
- Larry Donner! Did...

43:37.303 --> 43:40.806
- Did you pay a man to kill your wife?
- No! He just did it.

43:40.889 --> 43:44.476
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, look. I told a guy something...

43:44.560 --> 43:46.562
..and he took it the wrong way.

43:46.645 --> 43:49.148
What, uh... What did you say to him?

43:49.231 --> 43:52.568
- "Don't kill my wife", wink, wink?
- I don't like your tone.

43:52.651 --> 43:55.571
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I got noplace else to go.

43:55.654 --> 43:59.575
- My head is spinning.
- Oh, and my head isn't creamed corn?

43:59.658 --> 44:04.288
You announced that you may or may not
have inadvertently murdered someone.

44:04.371 --> 44:05.414
Mm-hm.

44:05.497 --> 44:09.710
This puts me in a highly distracted
state of mind. I am nauseous.

44:09.793 --> 44:15.007
Great! Margaret is dead, I have no alibi,
and you're mad that I upset your stomach.

44:15.090 --> 44:19.386
Well, excuse me. I'll just go
so the police can start their manhunt!

44:20.512 --> 44:23.223
One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper!

44:26.101 --> 44:29.020
Jeez, you think you know somebody.

44:40.949 --> 44:42.450
Cahuenga Pass.

44:42.534 --> 44:44.911
(Larry's voice)
Leave a snappy message. Bye.

44:44.995 --> 44:47.289
Larry, it's Beth. Um...

44:48.331 --> 44:53.003
Call me at home right now, OK?
As soon as you get in. I'm very confused.

44:53.086 --> 44:58.091
You... came in with just...
murder and Margaret, and I just...

44:58.842 --> 45:01.803
Call me... now. Thank you.

45:08.184 --> 45:10.645
- Larry!
- Get in the car, Owen.

45:10.728 --> 45:13.481
- This isn't your car.
- I borrowed it. Get in!

45:13.565 --> 45:17.110
I thought you might like to have this.
It belonged to Margaret.

45:17.193 --> 45:19.487
Get in the car. Get in the car!

45:23.074 --> 45:25.577
Look what you did. You killed my wife!

45:25.660 --> 45:27.745
No, I didn't. Yes, I did.

45:28.454 --> 45:31.833
You're sick, Owen. You need care.
I am taking you to the police.

45:31.916 --> 45:34.419
Did you know Hawaii
was a series of islands...

45:34.502 --> 45:38.131
..that was all spit up by the same
volcano? I never knew that.

45:38.214 --> 45:41.884
You killed somebody!
You're a murderer! You took a life!

45:41.968 --> 45:46.347
You're right. I'm no good.
How could I do that? I'm a sick, sick per...

45:46.431 --> 45:48.808
Cows!

45:48.891 --> 45:52.395
- Why did you kill my wife?!
- I thought you wanted me to.

45:52.478 --> 45:56.941
You said you wished she was dead.
I told you I wished my momma was dead.

45:57.024 --> 45:59.694
I kill your wife, you kill my momma.
That's fair.

45:59.777 --> 46:02.071
I am not killing your mother.

46:02.154 --> 46:06.075
- You have to turn yourself in.
- No. It was part of our plan.

46:06.158 --> 46:09.996
What plan?!
There was no plan, you moron!

46:10.579 --> 46:13.582
You killed a person and
I'm takin' you to the police!

46:13.666 --> 46:17.837
I'll just tell 'em that you did it.
You got the motive.

46:18.546 --> 46:20.840
- You're gonna tell them the truth.
- Huh?

46:20.923 --> 46:24.969
You're gonna tell the police the truth
or I'll kill us both, I swear!

46:25.678 --> 46:28.556
- I didn't do this only for me.
- Say goodbye, Owen.

46:28.639 --> 46:31.767
Larry... Larry, slow down.
You're goin' a tad fast.

46:32.685 --> 46:35.604
Please slow down, Larry!
I don't like goin' fast!

46:35.688 --> 46:38.691
- Are you gonna tell 'em you did it?
- Please slow down!

46:38.899 --> 46:40.568
Huh?

46:41.277 --> 46:43.696
- Yeah. I'll do it.
- OK.

46:44.655 --> 46:46.532
- Please stop the car!
- I can't!

46:46.615 --> 46:48.784
- Stop the car!
- There's no brakes!

46:48.867 --> 46:52.371
- What?! Watch out for that car!
- (car horn)

46:52.454 --> 46:55.249
- Oh. You're a good driver, Larry.
- Just shut up!

47:10.806 --> 47:12.266
Larry! Larry!

47:16.895 --> 47:19.940
Larry, you're originally
from the East, aren't you?

47:20.440 --> 47:23.694
- Owen!
- A man on our block was from the East.

47:23.777 --> 47:26.113
Mr Brockman.
He was in the button business.

47:26.196 --> 47:28.448
- Is that right?
- Yeah. This is good!

47:28.532 --> 47:30.617
It's like the Flintstones car wash.

47:44.381 --> 47:47.175
Larry! Ooh, I can't look!

47:47.259 --> 47:49.636
(truck horn)

47:54.641 --> 47:55.892
Whoa!

48:19.916 --> 48:23.586
So are you telling me
you weren't driving that car?

48:23.670 --> 48:26.339
Look, man. It's like I told you.

48:26.756 --> 48:30.927
He borrowed the car yesterday morning
and I haven't seen him since.

48:31.803 --> 48:36.432
- Did he say where he was going?
- No. Mumbled about motives and alibis.

48:36.516 --> 48:38.476
Motives and alibis?

48:38.559 --> 48:43.231
He figured that since Margaret ruined his
life, you'd think he killed her or somethin'.

48:43.314 --> 48:45.858
- You don't think he did?
- No, I don't think so.

48:45.942 --> 48:49.654
Personally, if the bitch stole my book,
I'd kill her. But that's me.

48:49.737 --> 48:52.615
Larry? There's no way he coulda done it.

48:52.698 --> 48:55.118
What makes you say that?

48:55.201 --> 48:58.287
Because Larry never did...

48:58.371 --> 49:00.248
..anything.

49:01.666 --> 49:05.503
OK. Here we go. Eggs a la Owen.

49:05.586 --> 49:08.464
(sighs) Owen, get it
through your thick head.

49:08.547 --> 49:11.342
I may be a lot of things,
but I am not a killer.

49:12.051 --> 49:14.470
You don't have to blow her brains out.

49:14.553 --> 49:17.765
Thank you! That takes
the pressure right off(!)

49:17.848 --> 49:20.810
She's old. She's got a bad ticker.

49:20.893 --> 49:23.938
All you gotta do is
jerk around a lot when you talk to her.

49:24.021 --> 49:26.941
- "Nice to meet you, Mrs Lift!"
- Would you stop it?

49:28.901 --> 49:33.030
Well, just meet her. Maybe she'd be
somebody you'd like to kill.

49:33.197 --> 49:36.158
(Momma) Owen! What the hell's
going on out there?!

49:36.242 --> 49:37.743
Nothing, Momma!

49:37.827 --> 49:42.164
- (whispers) We woke her up.
- Who are you talking to? Who's in there?

49:42.248 --> 49:43.916
- Nobody, Momma!
- (door bangs)

49:47.211 --> 49:49.296
Who's this?

49:50.673 --> 49:52.299
This is Cousin Paddy.

49:52.383 --> 49:56.553
He's gonna be stayin' with us for a while.
Isn't that nice?

49:57.429 --> 49:59.515
You don't have a Cousin Paddy!

50:01.934 --> 50:04.019
You lied to me!

50:04.812 --> 50:07.314
(Larry groans)

50:10.275 --> 50:13.195
- That's it. That's all.
- Larry... Larry.

50:14.655 --> 50:17.074
I'm sorry. She makes me so nervous.

50:17.157 --> 50:20.786
Come on. Go in there and sit down.
I'll get you some ice.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.749
So what do you think of her?

50:25.832 --> 50:28.377
I think she could relax a little bit.

50:29.461 --> 50:31.588
- Are you gonna do it?
- Owen...

50:31.672 --> 50:34.925
I'm not gonna kill your mother.
If you wanna do it, you do it.

50:35.008 --> 50:38.720
A guy kills my wife.
He can't even kill his own mother.

50:38.804 --> 50:41.348
- You wanna see my coin collection?
- No!

50:43.141 --> 50:45.227
I collect coins.

50:46.353 --> 50:49.856
- I got a dandy collection.
- I don't wanna see it, Owen.

50:51.233 --> 50:53.985
- But it's my collection.
- I don't care.

50:54.069 --> 50:56.821
Look, Owen. I'm just not in the mood. OK?

51:04.996 --> 51:07.165
Never showed it to anyone before.

51:10.085 --> 51:12.504
- All right, I'll look at it.
- No, it's OK.

51:12.587 --> 51:14.672
- Show it to me.
- No, you don't mean it.

51:14.756 --> 51:17.092
- Show me the damn coins!
- All right.

51:18.426 --> 51:20.512
This one is a nickel.

51:21.137 --> 51:23.515
This one also is a nickel.

51:24.808 --> 51:26.893
And here's a quarter.

51:27.894 --> 51:29.979
And another quarter.

51:32.106 --> 51:34.192
And a penny.

51:34.275 --> 51:37.278
See? Nickel, nickel,
quarter, quarter, penny.

51:37.362 --> 51:40.281
Are any of these coins worth anything?

51:40.865 --> 51:42.450
No.

51:42.533 --> 51:46.329
And here... is another nickel.

51:47.497 --> 51:50.666
- Why do you have them?
- What do you mean?

51:51.042 --> 51:55.630
The purpose of a coin collection is that
the coins are worth something, Owen.

51:55.713 --> 51:57.715
Oh, but they are.

51:57.799 --> 52:00.676
This one here I got in change...

52:00.760 --> 52:03.888
..when my dad took me
to see Peter, Paul and Mary.

52:04.722 --> 52:09.352
And this one I got in change
when I bought a hot dog at the circus.

52:09.435 --> 52:13.397
My daddy let me keep the change.
He always let me keep the change.

52:13.564 --> 52:15.316
This one...

52:15.399 --> 52:17.234
..is my favourite.

52:17.318 --> 52:21.614
This is Martin and Lewis
at the Hollywood Palladium.

52:22.114 --> 52:23.783
Look at that.

52:23.866 --> 52:27.286
See the way it shines on the little eagle?

52:29.622 --> 52:31.707
I loved my dad a lot.

52:34.293 --> 52:38.464
- So this whole collection is...
- Change my daddy let me keep.

52:39.298 --> 52:41.383
- What was his name?
- Ned.

52:41.467 --> 52:43.552
He used to call me his little Ned.

52:44.345 --> 52:46.889
That's why Momma named me Owen.

52:46.972 --> 52:49.058
I really miss him.

52:49.141 --> 52:52.478
- It's a real nice collection, Owen.
- Thank you, Larry.

52:52.561 --> 52:55.981
- Owen! Food!
- In a minute, Momma!

52:56.065 --> 53:00.444
Don't you "in a minute" me! Get off
your fat little ass or I'll break it for you!

53:00.527 --> 53:05.699
I want two soft-boiled eggs, white toast
and some of that grape jelly, goddammit!

53:05.783 --> 53:07.785
And don't burn the toast!

53:07.868 --> 53:09.411
- Kill her, Larry.
- I can't.

53:09.495 --> 53:13.999
You gotta kill her for me, Larry.
Don't you understand? Crisscross.

53:14.082 --> 53:18.587
Crisscross! You gotta do it, Larry!
If you don't, I will. I swear I will.

53:18.670 --> 53:21.089
Move it, fat boy!

53:21.173 --> 53:24.301
- That's it! I'm gonna choke her to death!
- No, Owen!

53:24.384 --> 53:26.553
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her!

53:28.138 --> 53:30.057
- Calm down, Owen.
- Larry...

53:30.140 --> 53:33.435
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK, Owen.

53:33.518 --> 53:35.604
I promise.

53:40.108 --> 53:42.069
Will you do it?

53:42.152 --> 53:44.112
Yeah. I'll do it.

53:44.237 --> 53:46.740
Larry, you're the best pal a guy ever had.

53:46.823 --> 53:49.159
Here. Look. I want you to have this.

53:49.242 --> 53:53.288
Look. Here. It's a souvenir from
the London Bridge gift shop in Arizona.

53:53.371 --> 53:58.835
Look. See? They brought this bridge over
from London, England, stone by stone.

53:58.919 --> 54:01.630
See the little bridge?
See the stones there?

54:01.713 --> 54:04.633
- Yeah, I see 'em.
- Here. You can have that.

54:09.304 --> 54:10.472
Crisscross.

54:12.057 --> 54:15.393
- When did you last see him?
- I can't remember. I told you.

54:16.478 --> 54:19.564
- The day after his wife disappeared?
- I didn't say that.

54:19.647 --> 54:24.319
- Miss Ryan, why are you protecting him?
- I'm not. I just don't think he killed her.

54:24.402 --> 54:26.988
Where do you think he is, Miss Ryan?

54:27.071 --> 54:28.990
I don't know!

54:30.074 --> 54:32.702
- He's in a lot of trouble.
- He didn't do it.

54:32.785 --> 54:35.622
Then who do you suppose did?

54:37.916 --> 54:40.919
- Somebody else.
- So you do think it was murder.

54:42.253 --> 54:45.465
- You know who killed her, don't you?
- No.

54:45.548 --> 54:48.676
- Yes, you do.
- I do not! He wouldn't tell me!

54:52.764 --> 54:56.476
Did Professor Donner
hire a man to kill his wife?

54:56.559 --> 54:59.687
No! He said... not really.

55:03.733 --> 55:08.446
And I heard him scream out
"l hate her! I wish she were dead!"

55:08.779 --> 55:12.366
Yeah, I heard him. He said
"l hate her. I wish she was dead."

55:12.450 --> 55:14.327
That's what he said.

55:14.619 --> 55:17.747
"l hate her. I wish she was dead."

55:18.706 --> 55:20.791
He called her a very bad name...

55:20.875 --> 55:24.128
..and screamed "l hate her.
I wish she were dead."

55:25.546 --> 55:27.632
It's a coffee-table book.

55:30.718 --> 55:32.720
(TV on)

55:35.056 --> 55:36.974
All right, Momma.

55:37.058 --> 55:39.477
Turn off the TV.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.312
OK.

55:43.189 --> 55:45.274
Goodbye, Momma.

55:50.362 --> 55:55.117
- She'll be sleepin' in a couple of minutes.
- I graduated from Yale.

55:56.076 --> 55:59.288
All right. Out you go.

55:59.705 --> 56:02.708
- Out? Out where?
- Out on the ledge. Go out on the roof...

56:02.791 --> 56:07.421
- No, no. I'm not going out on any ledge.
- You gotta make it look like a burglar.

56:07.504 --> 56:11.216
- You go in, you mess up things...
- No, Owen. This is going too far.

56:11.300 --> 56:12.843
- You want outta this?
- Yes.

56:12.926 --> 56:17.598
Then fulfil your end of the bargain. You go
in, stuff a pillow over her face and leave.

56:17.681 --> 56:21.185
You walk out that door.
You never have to see me again, OK?

56:21.268 --> 56:23.187
Oh, God!

56:25.647 --> 56:30.235
- OK. Out you go.
- Shit. I hate heights.

56:31.570 --> 56:32.571
Larry!

56:37.284 --> 56:39.369
- You all right? Move your hand.
- Why?

56:39.453 --> 56:41.163
Gotta close the window.

56:46.877 --> 56:49.463
And like this you kill an evening.

56:52.257 --> 56:54.760
Rats! Now I got Willard here.

56:56.595 --> 57:02.142
I'm bein' held captive by a little troll who
should be hanging off a rear-view mirror.

57:02.225 --> 57:04.311
I'm not doin' this.

57:07.105 --> 57:08.857
- Aargh!
- What are you doin'?

57:08.940 --> 57:11.985
I'm selling The Watchtower!
What do you think?!

57:12.068 --> 57:15.155
You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here!

57:17.532 --> 57:19.701
Rats.

57:19.784 --> 57:23.455
OK, forget about the burglar stuff.
Just go through her door.

57:23.538 --> 57:28.501
It's less dramatic but I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable. Here, use this.

57:28.585 --> 57:31.629
- I really don't like you, Owen.
- OK, I gotta go.

57:31.713 --> 57:35.091
If I'm late for my lane,
they tack on an extra buck.

57:43.433 --> 57:45.518
Ugh. What a week.

58:14.088 --> 58:19.468
Mrs Lift, I know you don't want to hear
anything derogatory about your son.

58:19.552 --> 58:25.266
I understand that. Because he's not a bad
man, Mrs Lift. He's a nice man, actually.

58:25.349 --> 58:28.352
He is a lunatic. No, Mrs Lift, he is.

58:28.436 --> 58:30.730
He's a lunatic. And, um...

58:31.063 --> 58:35.234
I don't have to be here now, Mrs Lift.
I could be in Mexico, out of all of this.

58:35.318 --> 58:37.820
I'm only here to stop him fr...

58:39.780 --> 58:42.283
How do you say this, Mrs Lift?

58:42.992 --> 58:45.119
Listen to me, Mrs Lift.

58:45.494 --> 58:48.831
Your son... killed my wife.

58:49.582 --> 58:53.335
And now he wants me to kill you.

58:54.545 --> 58:56.839
(snores)

58:57.256 --> 58:59.758
- Mrs Lift?
- (snores)

59:02.928 --> 59:06.599
- I'm gonna go read the paper now and...
- (snoring continues)

59:06.682 --> 59:09.226
I'm just glad we had this chance to talk.

59:10.686 --> 59:12.604
(snores)

59:14.481 --> 59:18.694
I'm a fugitive. The little bastard
turned me into Richard Kimble.

59:18.777 --> 59:22.239
He shit and shoved me in it.
I gotta get outta here! I gotta go!

59:23.615 --> 59:27.286
Where am I running? Evidence.
Incriminating evidence!

59:31.957 --> 59:33.834
Nothing.

59:37.921 --> 59:40.007
Ha! A lei.

59:40.549 --> 59:42.634
Poha jelly.

59:43.385 --> 59:45.470
Not enough!

59:46.054 --> 59:49.307
Poha jelly, a lei and a doll.
I need some evidence.

59:49.391 --> 59:51.476
Aha! Bingo. The mother lode.

59:51.560 --> 59:54.396
A plane ticket!
A little careless, Owen, aren't we?

59:54.479 --> 59:56.773
Los Angeles, Hawaii, 10am!

59:56.857 --> 59:59.943
(cackles) I got you! A plane ticket!

01:00:00.026 --> 01:00:02.112
With my name on it.

01:00:02.195 --> 01:00:04.072
Oh, God!

01:00:04.156 --> 01:00:06.241
(knock at door)

01:00:10.704 --> 01:00:12.581
Cops!

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.625
(knocking continues)

01:00:29.264 --> 01:00:31.349
Mr Lift?

01:00:34.644 --> 01:00:36.729
(heart thumping)

01:00:44.946 --> 01:00:47.115
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

01:00:47.198 --> 01:00:49.284
I hope there's no trouble.

01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:53.413
I was at the bowlin' alley all night.
I hope there's nothin' wrong.

01:00:53.663 --> 01:00:56.583
No, we'd like to ask you
about Professor Donner.

01:00:56.666 --> 01:01:00.003
- Professor Donner?
- Yes. Would you mind if we came in?

01:01:01.421 --> 01:01:04.007
- In the house?
- Just a few questions.

01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:07.176
I... I'm sorry. You can't.

01:01:09.637 --> 01:01:12.807
My momma's real sick.
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:01:13.224 --> 01:01:15.518
- lt'll only take a minute.
- No, l...

01:01:21.023 --> 01:01:23.317
OK! All right. Come on up.

01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:26.529
If it'll only take a minute,
that won't be so bad.

01:01:27.071 --> 01:01:29.156
Would you like to meet my momma?

01:01:32.493 --> 01:01:36.998
We understand you take Professor
Donner's course at Valley College.

01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:39.417
Yeah. Creative writing.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.211
I'm gonna put my bowlin' ball away.

01:01:42.294 --> 01:01:46.465
- I'm his star pupil.
- Do you have any idea where he is?

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:51.011
Did you try his apartment? He goes there
a lot. He keeps his stuff there.

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:55.099
You guys wanna have some tea?

01:01:55.182 --> 01:01:57.268
We've got orange pekoe,...

01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:59.812
..we've got lrish breakfast,...

01:01:59.895 --> 01:02:01.897
..we've got Darjeeling...

01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:05.609
Mr Lift, have you ever heard
Professor Donner talk about his wife?

01:02:05.693 --> 01:02:10.447
Professor Donner? Oh, he... he always
talked about her like she was an angel.

01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:13.909
He loved his wife.
He worshipped the ground she... Hi.

01:02:15.995 --> 01:02:18.789
Hi, tea! Hi, tea. Hi.

01:02:18.872 --> 01:02:22.334
You never heard him say
anything bad about her?

01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:27.548
Oh. This is lrish breakfast.
I'll get Darjeeling.

01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.009
Whatever you want, Mr Lift.
We won't be havin' any.

01:02:32.386 --> 01:02:35.180
- What was that question again?
- (Momma) Owen!

01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:40.435
Momma! You're alive!

01:02:42.646 --> 01:02:45.023
Old people - you have to reassure them.

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:49.903
Mr Lift, can we get back
to Professor Donner?

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.491
Yes. By all means, let's get back to him.

01:02:55.867 --> 01:02:58.912
- Mr Lift...
- Oh! You know what?

01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:01.456
This... This box is empty.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.709
Could you get me some tea in the pantry?

01:03:05.377 --> 01:03:08.088
Sure. No problem.

01:03:09.756 --> 01:03:14.177
(detective) You said that he loved his wife.
What gave you that idea?

01:03:15.178 --> 01:03:17.264
Oh! I'm sorry, officer.

01:03:17.347 --> 01:03:21.268
I have some tea right here on the stove.
It won't be necessary.

01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:24.813
- Oh. No problem.
- What was that question again?

01:03:24.896 --> 01:03:27.649
What makes you think
that he loved his wife?

01:03:29.609 --> 01:03:32.529
But you know what you could get me
is some sugar.

01:03:32.612 --> 01:03:35.365
Is it in the pantry?

01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:38.076
- Yeah.
- No problem.

01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:43.123
I shouldn't use sugar in my tea because
I'm carryin' around this spare tyre.

01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:47.001
I'd like to get rid of it
but it's so hard to cut back.

01:03:47.836 --> 01:03:51.798
- Owen! You did it, didn't you, Owen?
- No, Momma, I didn't.

01:03:51.881 --> 01:03:55.343
- Yes, you did!
- No! Honest to God, I didn't do it!

01:03:55.426 --> 01:03:58.388
You told them to take me away!

01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:01.474
Oh. No, Momma. No.

01:04:01.557 --> 01:04:06.854
- You came to take me away!
- I'm sorry. My momma's not feelin' well.

01:04:06.938 --> 01:04:09.273
Not feeling well, my foot!

01:04:09.357 --> 01:04:11.275
- I'm sorry.
- You little bastard!

01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:14.028
I said you'd desert me, and you did!

01:04:14.112 --> 01:04:17.407
The only way they'll get me
outta here is to drag me out!

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.618
You're gonna have to
take me out in a pine box!

01:04:21.994 --> 01:04:25.039
Get out! Get outta my house!

01:04:26.624 --> 01:04:28.501
Owen!

01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:31.379
You're grounded!

01:04:33.089 --> 01:04:35.800
I can't believe that you brought them here!

01:04:35.883 --> 01:04:38.719
- Why didn't you kill Momma?
- Because I'm not a killer!

01:04:38.803 --> 01:04:42.765
I can't put a pillow over her face
and squeeze the life out of her!

01:04:46.686 --> 01:04:49.647
- You see that door with the hook on it?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:55.403
Every night around nine o'clock, she yells
"Bath" and hangs her shawl on that hook.

01:04:55.486 --> 01:04:57.947
- I'll bet that's where I come in.
- Yeah.

01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:00.282
- Now, how did I know that?
- Come on, come on.

01:05:00.366 --> 01:05:02.118
- Watch out for my skates.
- Ow!

01:05:08.207 --> 01:05:10.292
(hinge falls down stairs)

01:05:11.835 --> 01:05:14.880
She'll get out of her chair,
she'll go to the door,...

01:05:14.964 --> 01:05:18.634
..you go behind her and pow!
Down the stairs she goes.

01:05:18.884 --> 01:05:22.513
- And where are you gonna be?
- Howie's Lanes. Come on.

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.904
To hell with this guy! What am l? Crazy?

01:05:39.696 --> 01:05:42.074
I'm outta here. I can't stay here.

01:05:42.825 --> 01:05:45.452
- I can't stay in this house!
- (siren)

01:05:54.086 --> 01:05:56.171
Stand back, please.

01:06:08.558 --> 01:06:11.061
Milk and Mallomars...

01:06:35.627 --> 01:06:37.712
Bath!!

01:06:38.922 --> 01:06:41.800
- Who the hell are you?!
- I'm Owen's friend.

01:06:41.883 --> 01:06:46.137
- Owen doesn't have a friend!
- That's because he's shy.

01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:48.348
No, he's not. He's fat and he's stupid.

01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:50.934
Get outta my house! Where is Owen?

01:06:51.017 --> 01:06:53.353
- Owen went bowling.
- I want Owen!

01:06:53.436 --> 01:06:56.231
- He'll be back soon.
- I want my bath and my medicine!

01:06:56.314 --> 01:06:58.816
- I can get it for you.
- Who the hell are you?

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.027
- Let me hang that up.
- I can do it myself!

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:05.615
- I know, but I'd like to hang it up for you.
- Get out of my way, you black bastard!

01:07:05.698 --> 01:07:07.408
What?!

01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:09.369
Mrs Lift!

01:07:09.452 --> 01:07:11.913
- He tried to kill me.
- What?

01:07:11.996 --> 01:07:14.457
I said, he's tryin' to kill me!

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.125
Mrs Lift! Don't...

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:19.045
I can hang up my own goddamn shawl.

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.593
He's trying to kill me!

01:07:25.676 --> 01:07:29.972
I asked for the salted nuts!
He brought me the unsalted nuts!

01:07:30.056 --> 01:07:32.683
The unsalted nuts make me choke!

01:07:37.855 --> 01:07:39.815
Aargh!

01:07:50.993 --> 01:07:53.079
Pain in the ass!

01:07:59.126 --> 01:08:01.003
Oh, no!

01:08:15.017 --> 01:08:17.435
Your friend had an accident. He's dead!

01:08:17.519 --> 01:08:20.648
You go bowling and leave
a corpse to take care of me!

01:08:20.731 --> 01:08:23.442
- He's dead?
- See for yourself!

01:08:25.277 --> 01:08:27.363
Larry! My friend!

01:08:27.446 --> 01:08:31.200
- My friend! Larry!
- (mimics) "My friend! My friend!"

01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:33.368
You little crybaby!

01:08:33.452 --> 01:08:36.997
Go bury him in the yard
before he stinks up the place!

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:47.149
Larry, you're alive!

01:09:50.236 --> 01:09:52.197
You killed her.

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:07.545
Holy shit! What a dream I was having!

01:10:07.629 --> 01:10:09.964
Louis Armstrong was trying to kill me!

01:10:10.298 --> 01:10:13.760
- Mrs Lift?
- Get away from me, you horse's ass!

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.766
(groans)

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:28.232
She's not a woman. She's the Terminator.

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:35.531
(dinging)

01:10:57.511 --> 01:11:00.681
The ex-husband of missing novelist
Margaret Donner...

01:11:00.765 --> 01:11:03.976
..is wanted for questioning
but has now himself disappeared.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.939
If you have any information regarding his
whereabouts, contact your local police.

01:11:09.023 --> 01:11:12.443
Owen! There's a murderer in the house!

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.362
Hello, police? I found him!
The wife murderer!

01:11:15.446 --> 01:11:17.740
- He's here!
- Gimme the phone!

01:11:18.157 --> 01:11:20.242
I'm on the next train to Mexico.

01:11:20.326 --> 01:11:24.079
- No! This is no time to panic.
- This is the perfect time to panic!

01:11:24.163 --> 01:11:28.459
She turned me in! Do what you want
with her. I gotta think about myself.

01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:30.628
Larry, don't leave me!

01:11:31.712 --> 01:11:33.422
Larry!

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:43.390
(cracking)

01:11:50.856 --> 01:11:53.150
I'm sorry, Larry.

01:11:53.692 --> 01:11:55.569
It's OK, Owen.

01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:59.823
- I messed everything up.
- Owen, it's gonna be OK.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.992
I ruined your life.

01:12:02.075 --> 01:12:05.829
Come on, Owen. Sometimes
things happen in life for a reason.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:11.543
No, really. Maybe I was meant to go to
Mexico to be a writer. You never know.

01:12:11.918 --> 01:12:14.129
This is a great ending.

01:12:14.212 --> 01:12:17.883
I don't have the beginning,
but this is a great ending.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:21.720
Story of my life. I always have
great endings and no beginnings.

01:12:21.803 --> 01:12:24.431
That's not good for a writer, is it?

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.600
No, it's not.

01:12:29.019 --> 01:12:32.105
How about "The night was humid"?

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:38.111
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah, hot and close.

01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:41.948
- Moist.
- Right. "The night was moist."

01:12:42.032 --> 01:12:45.827
This is what I'm talking about.
It's writing. Finding the perfect word.

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:49.748
The perfect start. "lt was the best
of times, it was the worst of times".

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:51.916
"Now is the winter of our discontent".

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.628
See what I'm saying?
Perfect beginnings. Perfect words.

01:12:55.712 --> 01:12:59.132
It's like us. We're on a train
to Mexico. We're on the lam.

01:12:59.215 --> 01:13:01.718
It's exciting, it's kinda mysterious.

01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:06.097
Do you say "The night was humid"
or "The night was moist"? That's writing!

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.349
The night was sultry.

01:13:13.813 --> 01:13:16.316
I'm getting the hell outta here!

01:13:17.942 --> 01:13:20.695
Too goddamn sultry in here!

01:13:25.241 --> 01:13:27.327
Where you goin'?

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.912
I'm gonna kill the bitch.

01:13:30.496 --> 01:13:33.166
- You want anything?
- You can get me a Chunky.

01:13:41.632 --> 01:13:45.720
- Come here, Mrs Lift.
- You stay away from me, you murderer!

01:13:50.516 --> 01:13:52.018
Momma...

01:13:52.268 --> 01:13:53.728
Mrs Lift!

01:13:54.145 --> 01:13:56.272
- (Owen) Momma!
- Murderer! Murderer!

01:13:58.482 --> 01:14:00.901
Momma... Momma...

01:14:01.277 --> 01:14:05.656
Sultry? I'll show you
something sultry, Mrs Lift!

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.366
G, 54.

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:12.455
Stupid bingo! Don't you idiots know
there's a murderer loose on this train?!

01:14:13.122 --> 01:14:15.833
- Mrs Lift, come back here.
- Bingo bastards.

01:14:15.916 --> 01:14:17.918
My mother's a little overmedicated.

01:14:18.002 --> 01:14:22.089
Murderer! Murderer!
There's a murderer on the train.

01:14:22.464 --> 01:14:25.676
Wake up, you nutheads! Murderer!

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:27.595
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:14:27.678 --> 01:14:30.306
Wake up! There's a murderer on the train!

01:14:31.098 --> 01:14:32.641
Mrs Lift?

01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:35.936
Aarrghhh!

01:14:36.687 --> 01:14:40.232
- Mrs Lift, be careful!
- Get away from me, you murderer!

01:14:42.151 --> 01:14:44.153
- No!
- (Momma yells)

01:14:48.031 --> 01:14:51.118
- Mrs Lift...
- Let me go, you murderer!

01:14:51.535 --> 01:14:52.911
Owen!

01:14:52.995 --> 01:14:55.330
- Larry, you'll kill her!
- Save me!

01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:59.209
I'm not tryin' to kill her!
I'm tryin' to save her, you toad!

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.050
Come on, Mrs Lift!

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:14.891
Owen! Save me!

01:15:18.395 --> 01:15:21.398
Aarrghhh!

01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:30.490
Owen! Save me!

01:15:30.574 --> 01:15:32.617
Owen!

01:15:32.701 --> 01:15:37.080
- What are you doin' to my momma?!
- Making a wish! What do you think?!

01:15:38.582 --> 01:15:40.625
Help!

01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:42.460
Oh, no! Larry!

01:15:59.394 --> 01:16:01.479
Oh, you saved me, my Owen!

01:16:01.563 --> 01:16:05.483
- Mrs Lift, are you OK?
- Beat it, chump!

01:16:07.026 --> 01:16:08.820
- Larry!
- Aarghhh!

01:16:12.615 --> 01:16:14.701
Bye, Larry!

01:16:20.498 --> 01:16:23.793
To tell you the truth,
it was all a little bit embarrassing.

01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:27.672
My earring fell over the rail.
I bent over to retrieve it.

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:30.133
The last thing I remember,
I was in the water.

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.052
She fell off the boat. She fell off the boat.

01:16:33.136 --> 01:16:35.680
The little bastard never laid a hand on her.

01:16:35.763 --> 01:16:37.932
This wonderful Adonis of the deep...

01:16:38.015 --> 01:16:40.727
Oh, I love that. "Adonis of the deep".

01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.855
She's rescued by a fishing boat!
The woman is priceless.

01:16:43.938 --> 01:16:47.191
- You gotta love this woman.
- Do you love this woman?

01:16:48.818 --> 01:16:53.489
Shikamoto nursed me back to health,
and we're going to be married.

01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:56.325
Who asked this guy
to pull her outta the water?

01:16:56.409 --> 01:16:58.619
(chuckles)

01:16:58.703 --> 01:17:01.581
Margaret Donner, author
of the best seller "Hot Fire",...

01:17:01.664 --> 01:17:05.710
..has sold the movie rights
of her ordeal at sea for $1.5 million.

01:17:05.793 --> 01:17:08.921
Will wonders never cease!
Back to you, Stan.

01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:15.136
She's a genius. She's getting $1.5 million
and I'm getting glucose four times a day.

01:17:15.219 --> 01:17:17.930
I'm getting something down the hall.

01:17:18.013 --> 01:17:21.725
- What?
- Anything. I can't take this any more.

01:17:21.809 --> 01:17:25.646
Every ten minutes,
it's "Margaret this" and "Margaret that".

01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:27.815
I'm sorry. I just can't help it.

01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:31.318
Hate's no good. I'm not
living here with you in hate.

01:17:32.111 --> 01:17:36.282
Get rid of it altogether, Larry,
or I'm leaving you.

01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:16.530
Oh!

01:18:18.865 --> 01:18:20.909
Oh, Larry!

01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:34.881
Argh!

01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:37.050
(static on TV)

01:18:47.519 --> 01:18:49.938
(gentle snoring)

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.455
His name was Owen...

01:19:07.539 --> 01:19:10.667
..and he wanted me to kill his mother.

01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:13.545
When I asked him why,...

01:19:13.628 --> 01:19:16.756
..he said because he didn't like her.

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:19.968
When I asked him why me,...

01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:23.763
..he said it was my idea.

01:19:28.142 --> 01:19:30.937
I was teaching college...

01:19:51.374 --> 01:19:53.459
(continues typing)

01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:06.055
(rings)

01:20:07.348 --> 01:20:09.976
- Hello.
- Aloha.

01:20:10.059 --> 01:20:12.561
- Owen! How are ya!
- I'm fine.

01:20:12.645 --> 01:20:16.148
- Where are you?
- In Topanga Canyon. I just killed Beth.

01:20:16.232 --> 01:20:19.360
- What?
- Nah, I'm kiddin'. Look out your window.

01:20:19.443 --> 01:20:22.071
You little couch potato!

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.158
- Hi, Owen!
- Hi, Larry.

01:20:26.784 --> 01:20:29.161
- Owen, come on up.
- OK.

01:20:30.037 --> 01:20:33.624
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too. It's been a year.

01:20:33.707 --> 01:20:36.627
- Wow. You look terrific.
- Thank you. So do you.

01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:39.213
- Well, thanks. How's Momma?
- Dead.

01:20:39.296 --> 01:20:42.258
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mm, well...

01:20:42.341 --> 01:20:44.051
Did you, um...

01:20:44.134 --> 01:20:45.803
No!

01:20:45.886 --> 01:20:48.472
No. Natural causes.

01:20:48.847 --> 01:20:51.600
- That's good.
- Yeah, well.

01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:55.396
- I see you're writing.
- I started the day I got outta the hospital.

01:20:55.479 --> 01:20:59.817
And I haven't stopped, Owen. I'm half a
paragraph away from finishing my book!

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.403
- That's great!
- Yeah, it's really somethin'.

01:21:02.486 --> 01:21:05.114
Well, you know what they say.

01:21:05.197 --> 01:21:08.450
(both) A writer writes... always.

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:11.036
Well, look. I won't keep you from it.

01:21:11.119 --> 01:21:14.498
- I just came by to say hello and...
- You just got here!

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:19.086
Actually, I gotta catch a plane. I'm goin'
to New York because... I wrote a book.

01:21:19.169 --> 01:21:22.339
- What?
- It's gonna be on the stands in two days.

01:21:22.798 --> 01:21:25.676
You wrote a book?
And it's gonna be published?

01:21:25.759 --> 01:21:28.387
- Yeah.
- Owen, that's unbelievable!

01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:31.556
It's called Momma and Owen
and Owen's Friend Larry...

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:36.228
..and it's all about you and me and
Momma and our experiences together.

01:21:37.479 --> 01:21:39.564
What's your book about?

01:21:42.275 --> 01:21:45.779
You wrote a book called Momma
and Owen and Owen's Friend Larry?

01:21:45.862 --> 01:21:47.948
Yeah.

01:21:48.865 --> 01:21:52.744
- It's all about our...
- (both)..experiences together.

01:21:54.955 --> 01:21:57.499
- Slut! You slut!
- Are you angry with me?

01:21:57.582 --> 01:22:00.168
- I don't like you, Owen!
- You want me to leave?

01:22:00.251 --> 01:22:02.754
No, I want you dead and in hell!

01:22:03.588 --> 01:22:05.298
(Owen gags)

01:22:05.382 --> 01:22:08.760
- I can't breathe!
- Because I'm choking you, you moron!

01:22:08.843 --> 01:22:10.470
Here!

01:22:10.553 --> 01:22:12.555
Here. I want you to have this.

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:14.516
- What is this?
- That's my book.

01:22:19.604 --> 01:22:23.107
- What is this? You wrote a pop-up book?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:26.277
See? Here's where we meet
in class. Pull that tab.

01:22:27.445 --> 01:22:31.241
See? And... And this is you and me
and Beth on the choo-choo.

01:22:31.324 --> 01:22:32.867
Toot, toot!

01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:37.622
And here's where you meet Momma.
See her cane?

01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:40.249
(mimics Momma) "Bath!"

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:45.088
- And these are my coins. See my coins?
- It's your coin collection!

01:22:45.171 --> 01:22:49.675
And here's... See, instead of you chuckin'
her off a train, we go on a picnic together.

01:22:49.759 --> 01:22:53.638
- What do we do? Devil-egg her to death?
- Oh, no. There's no death.

01:22:53.721 --> 01:22:56.516
- There's no death?
- No, this is a kids' book.

01:22:56.599 --> 01:22:58.601
- You wrote a pop-up book!
- Yeah.

01:22:58.684 --> 01:23:03.272
- This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
- Yeah, and here's the best part.

01:23:03.356 --> 01:23:07.985
We all go on vacation in Hawaii.
You... and me... and Beth.

01:23:09.237 --> 01:23:12.240
(Beth) "Hate makes you impotent,
love makes you crazy."

01:23:12.323 --> 01:23:14.951
"Somewhere in between
you can survive."

01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:18.120
- Gets better every time I read it.
- Thank you.

01:23:18.204 --> 01:23:21.832
- Except for the last line.
- I beg your goddamn pardon?

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:26.420
Hate makes you impotent, love makes
you crazy. In the middle you can survive?

01:23:26.504 --> 01:23:29.006
- Yeah!
- It's cryptic!

01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:31.550
- Cryptic, he says.
- That's right. Cryptic.

01:23:31.634 --> 01:23:32.551
Cryptic.

01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:36.847
Watch this, Beth. Have you ever seen
a weeble snorkel? Look at him.

01:23:36.931 --> 01:23:40.059
You know, actually,
I find it a little confusing.

01:23:40.142 --> 01:23:43.103
- Are you kidding me?!
- Just that last line.

01:23:43.187 --> 01:23:45.147
- Just the last line!
- Yeah.

01:23:45.231 --> 01:23:48.275
This is great. So you
and Sancho Panza agree on this?

01:23:48.359 --> 01:23:52.780
You're taking criticism from somebody
who had his book signing at Toys 'R' Us!

01:23:52.863 --> 01:23:55.282
I don't believe this.

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:58.952
- You're really agreeing with him?
- He's got a point.

01:23:59.036 --> 01:24:01.246
- He's got a point?!
- Yeah!

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:05.209
I'm a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate,
on the best-seller list.

01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:08.962
With his book, you get a free balloon!
I don't understand it.

01:24:09.046 --> 01:24:13.383
- (Beth) He's entitled to his opinion.
- I know he's entitled to his opinion.

01:24:13.467 --> 01:24:15.886
But look at him. He's a buoy with hair.

01:24:17.888 --> 01:24:22.267
Keep going a little further, Owen.
Maybe somebody'll harpoon you.

01:24:22.768 --> 01:24:24.853
("Shikisha" by Sipho Mabuse)

01:24:26.939 --> 01:24:29.024
People, get ready

01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:32.861
Wherever you are

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.408
People, get ready

01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:41.870
No matter how far

01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:02.933
Everywhere in the village

01:25:04.726 --> 01:25:07.646
People are dancing in the streets

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:11.274
It's the beginning of the new life

01:25:12.609 --> 01:25:15.737
You can turn it up on your radio

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:19.199
Shikisha

01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:21.201
Shikisha

01:25:21.284 --> 01:25:22.410
Shikisha

01:25:22.494 --> 01:25:24.579
Shikisha, wah, Shikisha

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.665
Shikisha

01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:29.751
Shikisha

01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:30.835
Shikisha

01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:33.004
Shikisha, wah, Shikisha

01:25:34.339 --> 01:25:37.133
People are dancing in the streets

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.637
Right across the Limpopo

01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:45.266
It's the beginning of the new age

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:49.520
So turn it up on your radio

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:53.024
Stomp your feet to the beat

01:25:53.107 --> 01:25:55.193
Feel the heat

01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:57.195
Stomp your feet to the beat

01:25:57.278 --> 01:25:59.363
Feel the heat

01:25:59.447 --> 01:26:01.491
Stomp your feet to the beat

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.659
Feel the heat

01:26:03.743 --> 01:26:05.745
Stomp your feet to the beat

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:07.455
Feel the heat

01:26:07.538 --> 01:26:09.749
Wah, Shikisha

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:12.585
Shikisha!

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:31.187
Stomp your feet

01:26:33.147 --> 01:26:35.232
Stomp your feet

01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:39.528
Stomp your feet

01:26:41.739 --> 01:26:43.824
Stomp your feet
