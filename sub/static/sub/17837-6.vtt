* When I see a man,
I see a lion *

13:11.859 --> 13:15.128
* When I see a man,
I see a lion *

13:15.162 --> 13:18.398
* You're the apple of my eye,
of my eye, of my eye *

13:18.431 --> 13:21.969
[music fading]

13:22.002 --> 13:26.206
[gun clicks]

13:26.239 --> 13:28.308
I ain't afraid
to play God, boy.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.277
I'm Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.279
Sniper Class 02-1.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.183
I could give two shits
about Sniper Class 02-1

13:36.216 --> 13:39.887
or Bob Lee Swagger.

13:46.026 --> 13:46.326
.

13:46.359 --> 13:46.826
BOB: Sergeant Major--

13:48.395 --> 13:49.462
O'BRIEN: I reckon
the person with the rifle

13:49.496 --> 13:50.463
is gonna dictate
this conversation.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.065
Where'd you find this?

13:52.099 --> 13:53.133
It was used to assassinate
the Ukrainian president.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.903
Really?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.504
So you come up here
thinking it's my bullet

13:57.537 --> 13:59.139
so I must be the shooter?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.508
Or that you sold it to
the person that took the shot.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.544
I hate to break it
to you, pork.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.613
That ain't my bullet.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.982
First prototypes
were sturdy like that.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.350
O'BRIEN: Then I realized
the only way

14:10.383 --> 14:12.052
to make a perfect bullet
more perfect

14:12.085 --> 14:14.154
is if it was untraceable
after it was fired.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.522
Mine splinter on impact.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.490
If it was mine
and they used it,

14:17.524 --> 14:20.460
there wouldn't be
any of it left.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.495
O'BRIEN:
What's your interest in it?

14:22.529 --> 14:23.931
BOB: They set me up.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.598
They framed me
for the assassination.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.968
Let me guess.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.938
A friend said he needed help.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.606
And you didn't see that ambush
coming a mile away?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.375
I taught you better than that.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.376
So you do remember me?

14:36.409 --> 14:37.444
O'BRIEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.912
You weren't a half-bad shot,

14:38.946 --> 14:40.380
even though you were
an annoying little shit,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.082
always looking
for a pat on the head.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.617
How'd you connect
that bullet to me?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.453
Tree of Liberty.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.221
The Tree--oh, yeah.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.622
O'BRIEN:
Had to raise some fast cash.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.992
Those Spokane boys,
they needed help,

14:52.025 --> 14:55.495
and their cash
was as green as anybody's.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.398
God damn Navy Squeal
couldn't shoot for shit anyway.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.400
You can keep making jokes,

15:00.433 --> 15:01.701
but a knockoff version
of your bullet

15:01.734 --> 15:05.072
was used on a head shot
at 1,500 yards.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.640
So whoever reverse-engineered it
did something right.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.543
1,500, huh?

15:10.577 --> 15:13.113
You want to learn
how to find the shooter?

15:13.146 --> 15:14.547
Get rid of your shit.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.551
[machine beeps]

15:23.256 --> 15:26.026
What's wrong, Mommy?

15:26.059 --> 15:29.196
Uh...nothing.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.731
Hey, come on, let's go.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.467
[ominous music]

15:34.501 --> 15:35.668
Are you hungry?
Yeah.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.504
You want to go eat?
Yeah?

15:37.537 --> 15:40.007
Hey, Julie, so how's it feel
knowing you went on TV

15:40.040 --> 15:42.642
and still no one
thinks your husband is innocent?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.244
Hey, do you know
what your daddy did, sweet--

15:44.277 --> 15:46.146
No, no, walk away now.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.580
You don't
like the attention?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.082
Maybe you shouldn't
have married a murderer.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.151
Hey, she's not interested,
okay?

15:51.184 --> 15:54.154
Mrs. Swagger, if I could just
have a minute of your time.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.058
I'm with my daughter.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.593
I'm writing a book
about your husband.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.728
Not interested.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.497
I don't think he did it.

16:04.531 --> 16:08.568
My publisher will pay
top dollar, six figures.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.204
I know that this
is not what this is about,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.240
but it's got to be hard
being the wife of the man

16:13.273 --> 16:16.276
that everybody believes
took a shot at the president.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.746
I can help.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.182
I said I'm not interested.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.584
[engine turns over]

16:24.617 --> 16:26.119
NADINE: You sure you
don't want to cop to these?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.121
Figured as much.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.090
Well, you think you're here
on goodwill to clear your name,

16:30.123 --> 16:31.691
only we have evidence

16:31.724 --> 16:34.094
you operated falsely
as a DHS agent,

16:34.127 --> 16:35.795
means we can hold you
for 72 hours.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.530
PAYNE: So you got me.

16:37.564 --> 16:41.634
But if I'm not DHS,
then what am I?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.204
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.605
No, it's fine.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.640
It's time to talk.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.680
I know Payne
was working with you.

16:55.748 --> 17:00.087
He's part of Homeland.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.621
Like you've never
been assigned an agent

17:01.654 --> 17:03.523
who turned out
to be bad news, hm?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.292
I barely knew the guy.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.094
Yeah.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.262
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around this whole thing.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.730
[scoffs]
We all are.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.565
You ever hear of Annex B?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.234
No, what is it?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.835
I have no idea.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.605
I can't seem to find it
in any of the federal databases.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.672
Must be above my clearance.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.141
Or it's bullshit.

17:21.174 --> 17:25.178
Well, maybe you'll
have better luck.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.814
Payne is talking about
something called Annex B.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.182
MEACHUM: Goddamn Payne.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.318
What is it?
I'm the one in the open.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.819
MEACHUM: Nothing you need
to worry about.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.755
Just do what you can
to shut Payne up.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.812
I know you didn't just
walk in uninvited.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.649
Isaac, holy shit.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.217
You didn't say
you were coming over.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.153
Oh, you pick up
a battalion command,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.387
now suddenly
I got to announce myself?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.821
Yeah, you do.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.190
I'm guarding
the nation's secrets.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.691
All you guard
is the president.

18:11.724 --> 18:12.825
Good to see you, brother.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.127
Good to see you too, man.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.128
It's been a minute, huh?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.263
Yeah.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.166
How's that mess in Seattle?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.234
Got Flashlight on the plane
in one piece.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.303
Just got to clean up now.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.238
You're a long way
from Brooklyn.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.873
We're both a long way
from Brooklyn now.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.710
Look at you, Pendo 5.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.446
You didn't come here
just to congratulate me.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.782
What do you need?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.450
I've known that look
since the fourth grade

18:37.484 --> 18:39.752
when you punched Andre Jones in
the nose, and you wanted me--

18:39.786 --> 18:41.621
you wanted me to tell
Mrs. Francis

18:41.654 --> 18:42.655
you were with me
the whole time.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.923
[laughs]

18:43.956 --> 18:47.194
You got a good memory.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.195
It's a good shot.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.762
Yeah.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.204
I need to get access
to the SCIF

18:57.237 --> 18:58.338
to get some intel.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.772
Before you say anything,

18:59.806 --> 19:02.409
I know it could put you
in a bad spot,

19:02.442 --> 19:04.444
but I wouldn't be here
if it weren't something big

19:04.477 --> 19:06.479
or something
I couldn't do myself.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.215
Messes with clearances, man.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.816
Demotion, early retirement,

19:09.849 --> 19:12.219
those are best-case scenarios
if shit goes south.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.753
I know.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.857
It's a lot to ask.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.892
But you're asking anyway.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.800
You did good
for yourself, man.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.436
I'm happy for you.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.243
Isaac.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.410
Hold up.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.786
Denise.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.356
Isaac, leave your phone.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.325
Thanks.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.894
[electronic beeping]

19:54.927 --> 19:56.763
[electronic trilling]

20:09.742 --> 20:11.344
Hey, Justin.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.714
You're not even gonna ask me
what this is about?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.283
Should I?

20:22.522 --> 20:24.957
What are we doing up here?

20:24.991 --> 20:26.426
We're gonna stare
out over the hills

20:26.459 --> 20:27.927
and recite poetry
to each other.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.962
What the hell
does it look like, pork?

20:29.996 --> 20:33.566
Jesus Christ.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.901
Open that up.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.975
BOB: Shit.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.043
What the hell is this?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.545
That's a Black King.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.547
And doing get any ideas;
she's mine.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.915
Give me that scope.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.785
Well, go on, set it up.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.387
Find the target, let's go.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.027
1,550 yards out.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.995
Yeah, rifle zeroed.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.765
Winds at 9, 10 miles an hour.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.367
[rifle clicks]

21:10.370 --> 21:13.373
[rifle blast]

21:13.406 --> 21:15.342
[laughing]

21:15.375 --> 21:16.576
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.944
You're like 5 feet high.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.812
I mean, holy shit.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.414
I saw a guy fire your bullet.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.815
It didn't sail like that.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.050
Yeah, just 'cause
he had my bullet

21:24.083 --> 21:25.485
doesn't mean he knew
how to use it.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.620
That feel like 220 grain
to you?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.021
It's 400.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.423
Good, you're not
completely stupid.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.458
Take another shot.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.593
[rifle clicks]

21:33.626 --> 21:35.495
Come on,
leg out and down, pork.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.596
I have a titanium hip.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.431
And I got a 5-inch dick.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.433
You don't hear me
bragging about it--let's go.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.370
[rifle blast]

21:43.403 --> 21:45.572
I don't know who
to feel sorry for,

21:45.605 --> 21:47.440
you for missing
2 feet from center,

21:47.474 --> 21:49.476
or me for not teaching you
how to shoot properly.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.644
[spent shell clinks]

21:51.678 --> 21:54.381
[rifle clicks]

21:54.414 --> 21:55.848
[exhales sharply]

21:58.585 --> 22:01.488
[rifle blast]

22:01.521 --> 22:04.424
[faint clang]

22:04.457 --> 22:08.027
Well, all right, then.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.630
That rifle and my bullet

22:10.663 --> 22:12.565
is rated at a quarter MOA.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.133
If your shooter had that

22:14.166 --> 22:16.102
and even a knockoff version
of my bullet,

22:16.135 --> 22:17.870
he'd be good
for at least 1,800 yards out,

22:17.904 --> 22:19.539
maybe farther
if the conditions were right.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.941
Put another one in there,
and listen up.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.543
There are four rifles
in the world

22:23.576 --> 22:25.678
that are strong enough
to fire a bullet like this one.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.847
And that's one of them
right there.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.090
You find the other Black Kings,

22:38.124 --> 22:41.428
you find your shooter.

22:41.461 --> 22:46.433
Hey, quick, quick,
shoot that bird.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.034
Give me the goddamn thing.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.705
[rifle blast]

22:52.739 --> 22:54.974
[laughs]

22:55.007 --> 22:58.110
I buy, you fly.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.479
Well, go get it.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.948
Bring the bird
back to the cabin.

23:01.981 --> 23:02.982
What do you mean?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.584
That hike will take me an hour.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.985
Well, it's a good thing

23:15.094 --> 23:15.462
.

23:15.495 --> 23:15.795
Got your bird.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.903
You can excuse yourself
whenever you're ready.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.171
Where are you going?

23:25.204 --> 23:26.806
I've got my business
to attend to.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.040
You can go on about yours.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.509
You said find
the other Black Kings,

23:29.542 --> 23:31.043
you find the shooter.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.012
Yeah, what, do you need me
to spell it out for you?

23:33.045 --> 23:35.014
But you still
would have needed somebody

23:35.047 --> 23:36.616
who was a damn good shot.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.051
Single mile head shot
with a variety of variables?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.987
Yeah, you'd have to be
pretty damn good.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.589
Well, then, who else
would have the other Black Kings

23:42.622 --> 23:43.956
that could make that shot?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.525
You got to know people.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.827
I must look like a walking
encyclopedia to you.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.062
No, more like a lonely asshole

23:50.096 --> 23:52.198
whose life revolves
around long guns and bullets.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.501
You watch it, boy.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.935
You might not have
people in your life

23:55.968 --> 23:58.004
you care about anymore,
but I do,

23:58.037 --> 24:00.072
and right now they're
suffering because of me.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.112
Man, I actually
used to look up to you.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.080
Now I really know
you're a fool.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.682
I don't know anyone else
who could've taken that shot

24:09.716 --> 24:11.083
besides you or me,

24:11.117 --> 24:12.885
and that's all I got
for you, pork.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.186
I'm not leaving
until I get an answer.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.888
Well, if you're
gonna stick around,

24:15.922 --> 24:18.991
make yourself useful
and clean the damn bird.

24:21.894 --> 24:26.232
You should see
the look on your face.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.500
You hate me.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.001
You probably get that a lot.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.570
That's true.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.572
I mean, sometimes I wonder
what it would be like

24:32.605 --> 24:34.173
to be on the other side of that.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.208
That's because
you're a sociopath.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.579
We're more alike
than you think.

24:39.612 --> 24:43.182
We both act first,
ask questions later.

24:43.215 --> 24:47.620
We both get shit on
by our bosses.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.255
Nah.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.158
We're two peas in a pod,
you and me.

24:57.630 --> 25:01.000
I'm curious, Jack.

25:01.033 --> 25:04.070
Have you ever felt
something for anyone?

25:07.039 --> 25:10.610
Yeah, sure.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.612
Right up until
the meter runs out.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.047
No, no.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.184
I'm talking
about that feeling...

25:21.120 --> 25:23.690
when you can't stop
thinking about a person.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.625
Sometimes you bother them

25:25.658 --> 25:30.096
because you want to see
if they'll react to you.

25:30.129 --> 25:34.934
What is it about me, Jack?

25:34.967 --> 25:37.970
Do I remind you
of your mother?

25:38.004 --> 25:39.739
Face it.

25:39.772 --> 25:43.042
You do feel something
for someone...me.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.644
You want to help me.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.113
Otherwise you wouldn't have
given me Annex B.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.362
Who's Hugh Meachum?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.364
He's the one that got away,

26:05.397 --> 26:08.300
or "getting away" might be
a better way to put it.

those militia idiots.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.010
Looks like our boy
found the bullet.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.779
We're rolling.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.213
All right, Isaac,
any longer,

26:21.247 --> 26:22.682
and people are gonna
start asking questions.

[gunfire on video]

26:26.085 --> 26:27.219
What is it?

26:27.253 --> 26:29.722
Annex B.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.390
It's not a file;
it's a program.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.292
ISAAC:
It's rated special access.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.261
I don't recognize
those uniforms.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.763

26:36.796 --> 26:39.065
There's a bunch
of documents as well.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.299
A lot of it's redacted.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.001
Looks like we've been
hiring PMCs

26:42.034 --> 26:44.003
to handle off-book black ops.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.838
That's unconstitutional.

into this.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.031
They shut us down.

What'd you get me mixed up in?

27:13.065 --> 27:14.033
Calm down.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.201
If anyone asks,

27:15.234 --> 27:17.236
I stole your credentials
and coerced you.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.872
You understand?

27:19.906 --> 27:24.076
Do you even have a plan?

27:24.110 --> 27:29.148
I keep telling myself I do.

27:29.181 --> 27:33.285
Didn't you have a wife
and son?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.420
Where are they?

27:34.453 --> 27:37.690
You know, I signed up in '69.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.325
I lied about my age

27:39.358 --> 27:42.294

to miss out on the action.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.698

they served.

You know, I tried to shake it,
let all that go.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.345
But never could.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.783
Thought that if I taught it,
maybe it would lose its power.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.486
But never did.

you were coming.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.302

Maybe we'll get lucky
and they'll be Air Force.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.472
Don't get in my way.
Yeah.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.374
Why would Payne
just give him up?

30:08.407 --> 30:10.910
To save his own ass.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.846
My guess is that Hugh Meachum
is the guy pulling the strings.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.114
Hugh Meachum is listed

30:15.147 --> 30:16.983
in the government directory
under DoD.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.985
That only happens when people
aren't supposed to know

30:19.018 --> 30:20.586
what you really do.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.855
My guess is, he's a spy.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.090
That's the rumor, anyway.

for a request

to be processed.

What can I say?

It's one of the benefits
of being in my shoes.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.907

any requests.

pretty convinced

with the answers.

meant to ask was,

30:59.425 --> 31:01.527
I did a few missions
with Mr. Payne,

31:01.560 --> 31:02.995
and he was found to be
unfit for duty,

31:03.029 --> 31:04.363

is in that file.

is the hardest part.

It's not the hardest part.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.065
Believe me.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.367

is tied to the assassination,

[bullet zips]

37:16.735 --> 37:18.304
[laughs]

37:42.461 --> 37:44.996
Couldn't have gotten them
before I got shot?

37:45.030 --> 37:46.798
[laughs]

37:59.511 --> 37:59.811
.

37:59.845 --> 38:00.479
BOB: What about
all the bodies?

38:01.913 --> 38:04.883
Ah, nature will
take care of them.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.920
My guess is,
no one will miss them.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.322
I can get you
to a hospital.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.023
No, no, no,
for this bug bite?

38:12.057 --> 38:13.091
How about into town to--

38:13.124 --> 38:14.360
Don't need anything.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.027
But I don't mind
running--

38:16.061 --> 38:17.696
Just get your stuff together
and get the hell out of here.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.666
I can take care of myself.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.737
Hey...

38:25.771 --> 38:27.673
Don't forget that.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.077
Just a stupid rifle,
come on, take it.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.922
[bullets rattle]

38:43.955 --> 38:45.957
Make 'em count.

38:49.961 --> 38:54.065
Bob Lee...

38:54.099 --> 38:57.068
You were the best shooter
I ever taught.

38:57.102 --> 39:01.807
Find that Black King,
and you finish it.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.942
And then do yourself a favor.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.944
Go home.

* It's time to say good-bye

39:14.453 --> 39:15.454
Hey.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.122
Hey, hey!

39:17.155 --> 39:20.025
He's a person of interest
in an ongoing investigation.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.561
Duty calls.
I want to speak to your C.O.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.430
We're taking custody of him.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.098
He's in violation of numerous
articles of the UCMJ.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.734
Okay, so who do I need
to talk to, then?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.736
The Secretary
of the Army.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.973
Hey, Jack...

39:35.006 --> 39:38.544
Don't get too comfortable.

39:38.577 --> 39:41.780
Who gave the authorization?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.449
UTEY:
Well, find out.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.517
[phone clicks]

39:45.551 --> 39:46.952
[sighs]
I know, I know.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.087
Meachum?
No, someone else.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.789
Official military orders.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.991
It just doesn't add up.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.092
Do you believe me now?

39:54.125 --> 39:56.762
[sighs]

39:56.795 --> 40:00.566
Oh, for Christ's sake,
are you gonna make me say it?

40:00.599 --> 40:04.002
Yes, I believe you now.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.171
All right, now let's get
back to work already.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.911
* I'm trying to survive

40:12.944 --> 40:17.783
* It's getting heavy
on my mind *

40:17.816 --> 40:21.453
* I'm walking on a tight rope

40:21.487 --> 40:23.889
* But I can't see
the other side *

40:23.922 --> 40:26.057
Where the hell you been?
Calm down.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.898
Payne's gone.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.165
What?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.901
He was cut free from the FBI.

40:35.934 --> 40:40.639
I've pinged his phone;
he's in the wind.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.808
That's gonna be
a problem for us.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.142
One of my agents
just disappeared,

40:44.175 --> 40:46.177
and the other appears
to be going rogue.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.080
So, yeah,
that's gonna be a problem.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.983
Swagger?

40:52.017 --> 40:53.184
How many men?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.220
Ten.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.526
The only reason
I signed up for any of this

41:00.559 --> 41:02.160
is because I thought
we were doing something

41:02.193 --> 41:04.229
that served
a greater purpose.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.597
Mm-hmm.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.633
One act prevents
a war, right?

41:07.666 --> 41:10.201
Or was it just to cover one
we'd already started?

41:10.235 --> 41:12.203
You have neither
the perspective nor the insight

41:12.237 --> 41:14.640
to sit there and act as if
you have this all figured out,

41:14.673 --> 41:18.544
so stop.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.612
Maybe I'm starting
to catch up.
