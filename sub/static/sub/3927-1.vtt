01:58.991 --> 02:00.367
Good luck.

03:39.216 --> 03:42.136
Hi. I have an appointment with...

03:42.303 --> 03:43.637
...Emily Charlton?

03:44.763 --> 03:47.266
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes?

03:47.433 --> 03:51.854
Great. Human Resources certainly has
an odd sense of humor. Follow me.

03:54.064 --> 03:56.901
Okay. So I was Miranda's
second assistant...

03:57.067 --> 04:00.070
...but her first recently got promoted,
and now I'm the first.

04:00.237 --> 04:02.448
- You're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

04:02.615 --> 04:05.117
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after a few weeks.

04:05.284 --> 04:07.077
We need someone
who can survive here.

04:07.244 --> 04:09.830
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, of course. Who's Miranda?

04:10.372 --> 04:13.125
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

04:13.292 --> 04:16.879
She's the editor in chief of Runway.
Not to mention, a legend.

04:17.046 --> 04:20.257
Work a year for her and you can get
a job at any magazine you want.

04:20.466 --> 04:24.136
- A million girls would kill for this.
- It sounds like a great opportunity.

04:24.303 --> 04:26.347
I'd love to be considered.

04:28.057 --> 04:29.642
Andrea...

04:29.808 --> 04:34.647
...Runway is a fashion magazine,
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

04:34.855 --> 04:37.107
What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?

04:40.152 --> 04:41.529
Oh, my God.

04:41.695 --> 04:43.113
No, no, no!

04:44.532 --> 04:46.367
What's wrong?

04:50.621 --> 04:53.332
She's on her way. Tell everyone.

04:53.499 --> 04:55.668
She's not supposed to be here until 9.

04:55.835 --> 04:59.046
Her driver just text-messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

04:59.213 --> 05:01.382
God, these people.

05:01.549 --> 05:04.176
- Who 's that?
- That I can't even talk about.

05:05.845 --> 05:08.264
All right, everyone. Gird your loins!

05:09.640 --> 05:12.017
Did someone eat an onion bagel?

06:13.704 --> 06:15.831
Sorry, Miranda.

06:26.675 --> 06:28.594
Move it.

06:29.762 --> 06:33.182
I don't understand why
it's so difficult to confirm appointments.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.184
I'm so sorry. I actually did confirm...

06:35.351 --> 06:38.062
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

06:38.270 --> 06:42.024
Tell Simone I won't approve that girl
she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

06:42.233 --> 06:45.694
I asked for clean, athletic, smiley.
She sent dirty, tired and paunchy.

06:45.903 --> 06:47.821
R.S.V.P. "yes" to
the Michael Kors party.

06:47.988 --> 06:52.034
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

06:52.201 --> 06:55.663
Then call Natalie at Glorious Foods
and tell her "no" for the 40th time.

06:55.829 --> 06:59.124
I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with rhubarb compote.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.795
Call my ex and remind him the
parent-teacher conference is at Dalton.

07:03.003 --> 07:05.548
Then call my husband,
ask him to meet me for dinner...

07:05.756 --> 07:07.675
...at that place I went to
with Massimo.

07:07.842 --> 07:09.844
Tell Richard I saw
the pictures he sent...

07:10.010 --> 07:12.221
...for that feature
on female paratroopers...

07:12.388 --> 07:14.056
...and they're all so unattractive.

07:14.265 --> 07:16.267
Is it impossible to find a lovely...

07:16.433 --> 07:18.102
...slender female paratrooper?
- No.

07:18.269 --> 07:19.854
- Am I reaching for the stars?
- No.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.313
Not really. Also...

07:21.480 --> 07:24.316
...I need to see all the things that
Nigel has pulled...

07:24.483 --> 07:26.151
...for Gwyneth's second cover try.

07:26.318 --> 07:29.154
I wonder if she's lost any of
that weight yet. Who is that?

07:29.780 --> 07:31.031
Nobody.

07:31.198 --> 07:34.201
Well, Human Resources sent her up
about the new assistant job.

07:34.368 --> 07:36.370
I was sort of
preinterviewing her for you.

07:36.537 --> 07:38.747
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for this...

07:38.914 --> 07:40.916
Well, clearly, I have to
do that myself.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.961
The last two you sent me
were completely inadequate...

07:44.170 --> 07:46.005
...so send her in.

07:46.172 --> 07:47.464
That's all.

07:48.632 --> 07:49.675
Right.

07:53.762 --> 07:55.973
- She wants to see you.
- She does?

07:56.140 --> 07:57.933
Move.

08:00.936 --> 08:02.688
This is foul. Don't let her see it.

08:02.855 --> 08:04.857
- That's my...
- Go.

08:12.323 --> 08:13.449
Who are you?

08:14.450 --> 08:15.993
My name is Andy Sachs.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.205
I recently graduated from
Northwestern University.

08:19.413 --> 08:22.041
And what are you doing here?

08:22.249 --> 08:26.629
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

08:27.213 --> 08:29.298
And...

08:30.799 --> 08:34.470
I came to New York to be a journalist,
and sent letters out everywhere...

08:34.636 --> 08:36.804
...and finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

08:37.014 --> 08:39.517
...and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources and...

08:40.601 --> 08:42.977
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.

08:43.187 --> 08:47.316
- So you don't read Runway?
- No.

08:47.483 --> 08:53.113
- Before today, you'd never heard of me?
- No.

08:53.322 --> 08:56.367
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

08:57.576 --> 08:59.203
Well...

08:59.787 --> 09:01.705
I think that depends on
what you're...

09:01.872 --> 09:04.750
No, no. That wasn't a question.

09:08.379 --> 09:11.340
I was editor in chief of
The Daily Northwestern.

09:11.507 --> 09:15.845
I also won a national competition for
college journalists with my series...

09:16.053 --> 09:17.721
...on the janitors' union...

09:17.888 --> 09:20.891
...which exposed the exploitation of...
- That's all.

09:27.815 --> 09:31.485
Yeah, you know, okay.
You're right. I don't fit in here.

09:31.652 --> 09:37.157
I am not skinny or glamorous and
I don't know that much about fashion...

09:37.324 --> 09:39.743
...but I'm smart.

09:39.952 --> 09:42.955
- I learn fast and work very hard.
- I've got the exclusive on...

09:43.122 --> 09:44.415
...the Cavalli for Gwyneth.

09:44.582 --> 09:47.793
The problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress she's wearing...

09:47.960 --> 09:51.046
...she looks like she's working
the stage at the Golden Nugget.

09:51.213 --> 09:54.466
Thank you for your time.

09:54.675 --> 09:57.595
Who is that sad little person?

09:57.761 --> 10:00.472
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

10:11.066 --> 10:12.401
Andrea.

10:17.364 --> 10:20.159
Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?

10:20.326 --> 10:22.703
Well, what was it, a phone interview?

10:23.495 --> 10:25.956
- Don't be a jerk.
- No, I'm just...

10:26.123 --> 10:28.751
Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.795
Okay, Doug. How is it that
you know who she is and I didn't?

10:32.004 --> 10:33.297
I'm actually a girl.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.966
That would explain so much.

10:36.175 --> 10:38.511
Look, seriously,
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.

10:38.677 --> 10:40.638
A million girls would kill for that job.

10:40.846 --> 10:43.599
Yeah, great.
The thing is, I'm not one of them.

10:43.807 --> 10:46.143
Well, look.
You gotta start somewhere, right?

10:46.352 --> 10:48.229
I mean, look at this dump
Nate works in.

10:48.395 --> 10:51.065
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello?

10:51.273 --> 10:54.735
Yeah, and Lily, she works at
that gallery, doing... You know...

10:54.902 --> 10:58.155
Oh, I'm sorry.
What exactly is it that you do, anyway?

10:58.322 --> 11:01.408
Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.

11:02.409 --> 11:05.204
- You're a corporate research analyst.
- Research analyst.

11:05.788 --> 11:07.706
- Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
- No.

11:07.873 --> 11:10.709
- It sucks. I don't... It's boring.
- It's all right. Breathe.

11:10.876 --> 11:12.127
- I'm trying.
- Take a drink.

11:12.336 --> 11:15.130
- I will have a drink.
- I would like to propose a toast.

11:15.339 --> 11:16.715
To jobs that pay the rent.

11:16.924 --> 11:20.636
- To jobs that pay the rent.
- Yes. To jobs that pay the rent.

11:20.845 --> 11:24.473
Oh, baby. You should see the way
these girls at Runway dress.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.433
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.769
You'll be answering phones
and getting coffee.

11:28.936 --> 11:31.272
You need a ball gown for that?

11:31.438 --> 11:33.357
I think I might.

11:33.524 --> 11:37.111
Well, I happen to think
you look great always.

11:38.904 --> 11:41.282
I think you're full of it.

11:42.825 --> 11:44.201
- Hey. Come on.
- Yeah.

11:44.368 --> 11:46.954
Let's go. I can think of
something we can do...

11:47.121 --> 11:50.249
...that doesn't require any clothing.
- Really?

11:57.923 --> 11:59.717
- Hello?
- Andrea.

11:59.925 --> 12:02.887
Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.264
She's putting up
the Sedona shoot from October.

12:05.431 --> 12:07.183
Come into the office this second.

12:07.391 --> 12:09.518
- Pick up her coffee order on the way.
- Now?

12:09.727 --> 12:11.395
Now, get a pen and write this down:

12:11.604 --> 12:14.231
I want one no-foam, skimmed latte...

12:14.440 --> 12:17.359
...with an extra shot and
three coffees with room for milk.

12:17.568 --> 12:20.654
Searing hot. And I mean hot.

12:25.409 --> 12:27.286
- Hello?
- Where are you?

12:27.453 --> 12:29.288
I'm almost there. Yeah.

12:29.914 --> 12:31.582
Shoot.

12:35.628 --> 12:38.631
Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?

12:38.839 --> 12:40.674
Has she died or something?

12:40.883 --> 12:43.844
No. God...

12:48.224 --> 12:50.684
Oh, about bloody time.

12:51.644 --> 12:55.564
I hope you know this is a very difficult
job for which you are totally wrong.

12:55.773 --> 12:58.234
If you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.

12:58.692 --> 13:01.070
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.

13:02.446 --> 13:05.407
- All right, where's the other layout?
- It's on its way.

13:05.616 --> 13:08.994
This is the first part of the collection,
which we talked about...

13:12.289 --> 13:14.917
Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.

13:15.084 --> 13:18.170
The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.

13:18.379 --> 13:21.298
Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.

13:21.507 --> 13:23.676
If I'm not here... Andrea, Andrea.

13:23.884 --> 13:25.386
- You are chained to that desk.

13:25.553 --> 13:27.763
Well, what if I need to...?

13:27.972 --> 13:30.307
What? No. One time,
an assistant left the desk...

13:30.474 --> 13:33.185
...because she sliced her hand open
with a letter opener.

13:33.394 --> 13:35.271
And Miranda missed Lagerfeld...

13:35.437 --> 13:38.399
...just before he boarded
a 17-hour flight to Australia.

13:38.566 --> 13:41.402
She now works at TV Guide.

13:42.486 --> 13:45.114
Man the desk at all times, got it.

13:48.492 --> 13:50.536
Miranda Priestly's office.

13:50.703 --> 13:51.996
No, she's not available.

13:52.204 --> 13:53.789
Who is...?

13:55.875 --> 13:57.835
Yes, I will tell her you called.

13:58.002 --> 14:00.045
Yet again.

14:01.172 --> 14:03.674
Remember,
you and I have totally different jobs.

14:03.883 --> 14:06.719
I mean, you get coffee
and you run errands.

14:06.886 --> 14:08.470
I am in charge of her schedule...

14:08.637 --> 14:11.432
...her appointments
and her expenses...

14:11.640 --> 14:15.936
...and most importantly, I get to go with
her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.

14:16.604 --> 14:19.398
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and parties.

14:19.565 --> 14:22.067
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.

14:23.444 --> 14:25.154
Okay, now, stay here.

14:25.362 --> 14:28.574
I'm going to the Art Department
to give them the Book.

14:28.741 --> 14:32.119
- The...?
- This is the Book.

14:32.286 --> 14:36.332
Now, it is a mockup of
everything in the current issue.

14:36.499 --> 14:40.169
We deliver it to Miranda's apartment
every night and she retu... Don't touch.

14:40.336 --> 14:42.838
She returns it to us in the morning
with her notes.

14:43.005 --> 14:46.217
Now, second assistant
is supposed to do this...

14:46.383 --> 14:50.221
...but Miranda is very private and
she does not like strangers in her house.

14:50.429 --> 14:53.390
So until she decides that
you're not a total psycho...

14:53.557 --> 14:55.726
...I get the lovely task of
waiting around for the Book.

14:58.312 --> 15:01.315
- Emily? What do I do if...?
- Deal with it.

15:06.487 --> 15:09.406
Hello, Mrs. Priestly's office.

15:10.074 --> 15:12.326
That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.

15:14.662 --> 15:18.457
You know, she is in a meeting.
Could I please take a message?

15:21.293 --> 15:22.878
Okay.

15:23.045 --> 15:25.756
Can you please spell "Gabbana"?

15:26.298 --> 15:27.925
Hello?

15:28.843 --> 15:30.344
Guess not.

15:31.804 --> 15:34.306
I guessed an eight and a half.

15:34.473 --> 15:37.184
Wow, that's very nice of you.

15:37.393 --> 15:39.937
But I don't think I need these.
Miranda hired me.

15:40.104 --> 15:42.523
- She knows what I look like.
- Do you?

15:46.777 --> 15:48.737
Emily.

15:49.029 --> 15:50.739
Emily?

15:51.490 --> 15:53.492
She means you.

15:56.704 --> 16:00.249
- We just cut on the bias and so what...
- No, that's not what I asked you.

16:00.416 --> 16:04.003
There you are, Emily. How many times
do I have to scream your name?

16:04.170 --> 16:05.379
Actually, it's Andy.

16:07.673 --> 16:11.844
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but everybody calls me Andy.

16:15.055 --> 16:19.518
- I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.
- Okay. What kind of skirts do you...?

16:19.685 --> 16:22.479
Please bore someone else
with your questions.

16:22.646 --> 16:26.192
And make sure we have Pier 59
at 8 a.m. Tomorrow.

16:26.358 --> 16:30.112
Remind Jocelyn I need to see those
satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.

16:30.279 --> 16:33.407
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie
if Maggie isn't available.

16:33.574 --> 16:35.159
Did Demarchelier confirm?

16:36.368 --> 16:38.787
- Did Demarcheli...?
- Demarchelier. Did he...

16:38.954 --> 16:40.498
Get him on the phone.

16:41.790 --> 16:43.501
Okay.

16:44.502 --> 16:45.961
And, Emily...

16:46.420 --> 16:47.463
Yes?

16:59.016 --> 17:00.100
That's all.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.811
It's the cavalier disregard for...

17:11.737 --> 17:13.446
Do you have Demarchelier?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.491
Demarchelier.

17:15.699 --> 17:17.284
Leave it.

17:17.451 --> 17:19.078
Do you have...? Oh.

17:21.288 --> 17:25.209
I have Miranda Priestly calling.
I have Patrick!

17:27.461 --> 17:30.548
She called me in there and then
she asked me about Pier 59.

17:30.714 --> 17:34.635
And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

17:34.802 --> 17:37.930
And she needs skirts
from Calvin Klein.

17:38.347 --> 17:41.642
And there was something
about a pony.

17:42.101 --> 17:44.270
- Did she say which skirts?
- No.

17:44.436 --> 17:46.522
- Did she say what kind?
- I tried to ask her.

17:46.689 --> 17:48.983
You may never ask Miranda anything.

17:49.149 --> 17:53.195
Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.

17:55.114 --> 17:56.615
- Me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:56.782 --> 17:58.450
Do you have some prior commitment?

17:58.617 --> 18:00.995
Some hideous-skirt convention
you have to go to?

18:16.844 --> 18:18.179
- Miranda?
- Are you there?

18:18.345 --> 18:21.223
I'm about to walk in.
I'll call you as soon as I...

18:24.894 --> 18:26.228
- Hello?
- While you're out...

18:26.395 --> 18:30.191
...Miranda needs you to go to Hermès
to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.

18:30.357 --> 18:33.194
Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.070
Miranda went out
to meet with Meisel.

18:35.237 --> 18:37.406
She'll want more Starbucks
when she gets back.

18:37.573 --> 18:41.202
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first...? Hello?

18:45.873 --> 18:47.917
Oh, my God.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.669
What took you so long?
I have to pee.

18:50.836 --> 18:52.505
- You haven't peed since I left?
- No.

18:52.671 --> 18:55.174
Been manning the desk, haven't I?
I'm bursting.

19:00.179 --> 19:01.972
Oh, hi.

19:03.641 --> 19:06.977
- You do coat. Do the coat.
- Okay.

19:08.187 --> 19:11.440
Be prepared. The run-through
is at 12:30, and people are panicking.

19:11.607 --> 19:14.151
So the phone is going
to be ringing off the hook.

19:14.318 --> 19:15.945
The run-through. Right.

19:16.487 --> 19:19.615
Yes. Editors bring in options
for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.

19:19.782 --> 19:22.284
She chooses every single thing
in every single issue.

19:22.451 --> 19:25.246
It's a huge deal. I don't know
why you don't know that.

19:25.412 --> 19:27.248
- Okay, are you ready?
- Oh, hi, hi.

19:27.790 --> 19:30.626
Right, well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

19:30.793 --> 19:32.795
- This is her, the new me.
- Hi.

19:32.962 --> 19:35.005
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.

19:35.172 --> 19:36.882
No, quite serious, yeah.

19:37.049 --> 19:39.134
I get 20 minutes for lunch,
and you get 15.

19:39.301 --> 19:41.554
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.891
- What exactly is she wearing?
- Her grandmother's skirt.

19:58.362 --> 20:01.532
Corn chowder.
That's an interesting choice.

20:01.907 --> 20:06.370
You do know that cellulite is one of
the main ingredients in corn chowder?

20:11.584 --> 20:13.294
None of the girls here eat anything?

20:13.460 --> 20:17.464
Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.

20:17.631 --> 20:19.133
Well, I'm a six.

20:19.967 --> 20:22.344
Which is the new 14.

20:25.931 --> 20:27.641
- Shoot.
- Oh, never mind.

20:27.808 --> 20:31.687
I'm sure you have plenty more poly blend
where that came from.

20:32.646 --> 20:33.939
Okay.

20:34.106 --> 20:36.275
You think my clothes are hideous,
I get it.

20:36.442 --> 20:39.486
But, you know, I'm not
going to be in fashion forever...

20:39.653 --> 20:43.657
...so I don't see the point of changing
myself just because I have this job.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.534
Yes, that's true.

20:45.701 --> 20:49.455
That's what this multi-billion-dollar
industry is all about, anyway, isn't it?

20:49.622 --> 20:50.956
Inner beauty.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.753
Hello?

20:56.712 --> 20:58.172
Right. Come on.

20:58.339 --> 21:00.925
Miranda's pushed the run-through
up a half an hour.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.635
She's always 15 minutes early.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.595
- Which means...?
- You're already late.

21:04.762 --> 21:07.515
- Come. Excuse me.
- Shoot!

21:09.642 --> 21:12.102
- Mr. Ravitz.
- Nigel.

21:13.562 --> 21:16.190
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

21:16.357 --> 21:21.612
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn
jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

21:21.779 --> 21:25.699
- What's that costing me?
- About 300,000.

21:26.283 --> 21:28.744
Must have been some lousy jackets.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.789
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:31.956 --> 21:34.041
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

21:34.208 --> 21:38.754
Oh, congratulations, young lady.
A million girls would kill for that job.

21:38.921 --> 21:40.840
Bye-bye.

21:41.799 --> 21:44.718
Chairman of Elias-Clarke. Irv Ravitz.

21:44.885 --> 21:49.640
You know what they say:
Tiny man, huge ego.

21:52.351 --> 21:55.187
No. And I've seen all this before.

21:55.354 --> 21:58.190
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so it's...

21:58.357 --> 22:01.318
- Where are all the other dresses?
- We have some right here.

22:01.485 --> 22:04.655
- Stand, watch and listen.
- I think it can be very interesting...

22:04.822 --> 22:05.865
No.

22:06.365 --> 22:08.993
No, I just...
It's just baffling to me.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.079
Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent run-through?

22:12.246 --> 22:15.291
You people have had
hours and hours to prepare.

22:15.457 --> 22:19.837
It's just so confusing to me.
Where are the advertisers?

22:20.004 --> 22:23.090
- We have some pieces from Banana...
- We need more, don't we? Oh.

22:23.257 --> 22:24.800
This is...

22:24.967 --> 22:28.053
- This might be... What do you think of...?
- Yeah. You know me.

22:28.220 --> 22:31.724
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon, and I'm onboard.

22:31.891 --> 22:35.269
- But do you think it's too much like...?
- Like the Lacroix from July?

22:35.436 --> 22:38.189
I thought that, but no,
not with the right accessories.

22:38.355 --> 22:40.399
Where are the belts for this dress?

22:40.733 --> 22:42.985
Why is no one ready?

22:43.152 --> 22:47.615
Here. It's a tough call.
They're so different.

22:54.246 --> 22:55.581
Something funny?

22:59.126 --> 23:01.754
No. No, no, nothing's...

23:01.921 --> 23:06.050
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

23:06.217 --> 23:10.387
You know, I'm still
learning about this stuff and...

23:10.554 --> 23:13.265
"This stuff"?

23:14.099 --> 23:19.230
Oh, okay. I see. You think
this has nothing to do with you.

23:20.272 --> 23:22.691
You go to your closet...

23:22.858 --> 23:27.196
...and you select, I don't know,
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

23:27.363 --> 23:31.158
...because you're trying to tell the world
you take yourself too seriously...

23:31.325 --> 23:32.993
...to care about what you put on...

23:33.160 --> 23:36.372
...but what you don't know is that
that sweater is not just blue.

23:36.539 --> 23:40.835
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.

23:41.001 --> 23:43.212
And you're also blithely
unaware of the fact...

23:43.379 --> 23:47.424
...that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns...

23:47.591 --> 23:51.762
...and then it was Yves Saint Laurent
who showed cerulean military jackets.

23:51.929 --> 23:53.389
I think we need a jacket here.

23:54.682 --> 23:58.727
Then cerulean quickly showed up in the
collections of eight different designers.

23:58.894 --> 24:02.022
And then it filtered down through
the department stores...

24:02.189 --> 24:06.360
...and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

24:06.527 --> 24:09.363
...where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.

24:09.530 --> 24:14.201
However, that blue represents
millions of dollars and countless jobs.

24:14.368 --> 24:17.580
And it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

24:17.746 --> 24:20.040
...that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

24:20.207 --> 24:23.586
...when, in fact, you're wearing
a sweater that was selected for you...

24:23.752 --> 24:26.547
...by the people in this room...

24:26.714 --> 24:29.049
...from a pile of "stuff."

24:29.675 --> 24:32.136
And then I said, no,
I couldn't see the difference...

24:32.303 --> 24:34.471
...between the two
absolutely identical belts.

24:34.638 --> 24:36.515
You should've seen
the look she gave me.

24:36.682 --> 24:39.852
I swear, I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

24:40.019 --> 24:41.395
It's not funny.

24:41.562 --> 24:45.608
She is not happy unless everyone around
her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

24:45.774 --> 24:48.736
And the clackers just worship her.

24:48.903 --> 24:50.738
- The who?
- They call them "clackers."

24:50.946 --> 24:53.616
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

24:53.782 --> 24:55.201
It's like:

24:57.161 --> 24:59.872
And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.

25:00.039 --> 25:04.543
The amount of time and energy
that these people spend...

25:04.710 --> 25:08.172
...on these insignificant, minute details.
And for what?

25:08.339 --> 25:11.217
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000...

25:11.383 --> 25:14.011
...reshooting something
that was fine to begin with...

25:14.178 --> 25:18.432
...to sell people things
they don't need. God!

25:20.392 --> 25:23.395
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?

25:23.562 --> 25:27.191
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh, no, no, no. Give me that.

25:27.358 --> 25:30.194
There's, like, $8 of Jarlsberg in there.

25:31.403 --> 25:33.072
Know what?

25:33.989 --> 25:36.408
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

25:36.575 --> 25:39.119
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

25:39.495 --> 25:41.789
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

25:41.956 --> 25:44.291
Easy there, tiger.

25:46.544 --> 25:49.588
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

25:51.298 --> 25:53.884
I don't see my breakfast here.
Where are my eggs?

25:54.051 --> 25:55.678
Excuse me!

25:55.845 --> 25:58.806
Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.

25:59.014 --> 26:02.434
Have the brakes checked on my car.

26:05.062 --> 26:08.148
Where is that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

26:08.816 --> 26:10.192
Girls need new surfboards...

26:10.359 --> 26:13.195
...or boogie boards
or something for spring break.

26:13.821 --> 26:16.532
- Hello?
- The twins also need flip-flops.

26:19.743 --> 26:21.787
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik...

26:21.954 --> 26:24.540
...and then go get Patricia.
- Who's that?

26:24.707 --> 26:26.584
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

26:26.750 --> 26:30.296
Get me that little table that I like
at that store on Madison.

26:30.462 --> 26:34.425
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.052
- Notes delivered today.
Where is everyone?

26:37.219 --> 26:40.347
Why is no one working?
- East Side.

26:41.515 --> 26:43.934
Get me Demarchelier.

26:50.149 --> 26:53.402
I have Miranda Priestly
calling for... Okay.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.739
I have Patrick.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.413
Thank God it's Friday, right?

27:04.580 --> 27:08.751
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we
don't have to be on call this weekend.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.920
You know, my dad's coming in
from Ohio.

27:11.086 --> 27:14.381
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner
and maybe see Chicago.

27:14.548 --> 27:16.258
You doing anything fun this weekend?

27:16.842 --> 27:18.260
Yes.

27:22.264 --> 27:24.225
Yeah, Nate said it was great.

27:24.391 --> 27:28.062
He actually... He applied here but they
wanted someone with more experience.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.189
- Here.
- What's this?

27:30.356 --> 27:32.858
I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.

27:33.025 --> 27:36.070
- Dad? How did you...?
- It's...

27:36.987 --> 27:39.114
I'm gonna kill Mom.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.117
Thank you.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.291
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

27:50.209 --> 27:54.630
So do you wanna start grilling me now,
or should we wait till after dinner?

27:54.797 --> 27:57.716
I thought I'd let you
at least enjoy the breadbasket first.

27:57.883 --> 27:59.844
No, no, no, that's okay.
Go right ahead.

28:00.469 --> 28:02.221
We're just a little worried, honey.

28:02.388 --> 28:04.932
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2 a.m.

28:05.099 --> 28:07.643
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.812
Hey, that's not fair.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.272
I wrote those e-mails.

28:12.356 --> 28:15.818
I'm trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

28:15.985 --> 28:19.822
...turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.950
Dad, you have to trust me.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.911
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

28:26.745 --> 28:29.540
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda
in a few months...

28:29.707 --> 28:33.502
...and she's gonna meet editors and
writers from every important magazine...

28:33.669 --> 28:35.546
...and in a year, that could be me.

28:36.672 --> 28:41.927
All right? Dad, I swear,
this is my break. This is my...

28:42.094 --> 28:44.471
My chance. This is...

28:44.638 --> 28:46.515
...my boss.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.769
I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.

28:50.936 --> 28:55.107
- Hello, Miranda?
- My flight has been cancelled.

28:55.274 --> 28:58.736
There's some absurd weather problem.
I need to get home tonight.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.405
The twins have a recital
tomorrow morning at school.

29:01.572 --> 29:02.990
- What?
- At school.

29:03.157 --> 29:05.826
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

29:05.993 --> 29:08.787
Hi. I know this is totally last minute...

29:08.954 --> 29:12.208
...but I was hoping that you could
maybe get a flight for my boss...

29:12.374 --> 29:14.668
...from Miami to New York tonight?

29:16.086 --> 29:19.006
- Yeah. Yeah, any kind of jet.
- Right here. Thank you.

29:19.173 --> 29:21.050
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.302
Yes, I need it tonight. I need it...

29:23.469 --> 29:26.347
- I thought you were going out...
- No. It's over here, honey.

29:26.514 --> 29:31.185
Hi, I'm trying to get a flight tonight,
for tonight, from Miami to New York.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.313
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

29:34.897 --> 29:37.441
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing?

29:37.608 --> 29:40.027
It's for Miranda Priestly.
She's a client of yours.

29:40.194 --> 29:42.196
She's flown with you before.
Yes, yes, hi.

29:42.363 --> 29:45.241
I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

29:45.407 --> 29:47.618
- Yeah. Sorry, hold on.
- What?

29:47.785 --> 29:49.286
Hello? Miranda, hi.

29:49.453 --> 29:52.957
I'm trying to get a flight, but no one
is flying, because of the weather.

29:53.123 --> 29:56.919
Please. It's just,
I don't know, drizzling.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.796
Well, someone must be getting out.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.756
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

30:00.923 --> 30:03.300
Call everybody else that we know
that has a jet.

30:03.467 --> 30:06.053
Call every... This is your respons...
This is your job.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.097
Get me home.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.891
Oh, my God.
She's going to murder me.

30:11.058 --> 30:14.228
What does she want you to do,
have the National Guard airlift her?

30:14.395 --> 30:16.772
Of course not. Could I do that?

30:17.189 --> 30:18.899
Come on. Come on.

30:20.693 --> 30:23.320
The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

30:23.487 --> 30:25.739
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

30:25.906 --> 30:32.371
Everyone except me,
because, sadly, I was not there.

30:33.372 --> 30:36.876
- Miranda, I'm so sorry.
- Do you know why I hired you?

30:37.626 --> 30:40.045
I always hire the same girl.

30:40.212 --> 30:45.217
Stylish, slender, of course,
worships the magazine.

30:45.384 --> 30:48.596
But so often, they turn out to be...

30:48.762 --> 30:51.515
...I don't know, disappointing. And...

30:52.975 --> 30:54.310
...stupid.

30:55.352 --> 30:59.398
So you,
with that impressive résumé...

30:59.565 --> 31:02.526
...and the big speech
about your so-called work ethic...

31:02.693 --> 31:05.613
...I thought you would be different.

31:06.363 --> 31:10.951
I said to myself, "Go ahead.
Take a chance.

31:11.118 --> 31:14.371
Hire the smart fat girl."

31:16.332 --> 31:18.375
I had hope.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.628
My God, I live on it.

31:21.629 --> 31:25.508
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than...

31:26.509 --> 31:28.928
More than any
of the other silly girls.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.518
I really did everything I could think of.

31:35.726 --> 31:37.978
That's all.

31:47.404 --> 31:49.907
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.470
She hates me, Nigel.

32:12.429 --> 32:16.767
And that's my problem because...
Oh, wait, no. It's not my problem.

32:16.976 --> 32:20.312
I don't know what else I can do
because if I do something right...

32:20.521 --> 32:23.148
...it's unacknowledged.
She doesn't even say thank you.

32:23.315 --> 32:28.362
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.489
So quit.

32:30.906 --> 32:32.324
What?

32:32.533 --> 32:34.326
- Quit.
- Qui...

32:34.535 --> 32:36.996
I can get a girl to take
your job in five minutes.

32:37.204 --> 32:38.956
One who really wants it.

32:39.165 --> 32:41.500
But no, I don't wanna quit.
That's not fair.

32:41.709 --> 32:44.211
But I... You know,
I'm just saying that...

32:44.420 --> 32:48.591
...I would just like a little credit for
the fact that I'm killing myself trying.

32:48.799 --> 32:52.636
Andy, be serious. You are not trying.

32:53.512 --> 32:56.515
You are whining.

32:57.474 --> 32:59.310
What do you want me
to say to you, huh?

32:59.810 --> 33:02.813
Do you want me to say, "Poor you,
Miranda's picking on you...

33:03.022 --> 33:05.065
...poor you, poor Andy"?

33:05.274 --> 33:09.445
Wake up, six. She's just doing her job.

33:09.653 --> 33:11.197
You are working at the place...

33:11.405 --> 33:14.408
...that published some of
the greatest artists of the century:

33:14.617 --> 33:17.828
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

33:18.037 --> 33:23.250
And what they did, what they created,
was greater than art.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.294
Because you live your life in it.

33:26.837 --> 33:30.716
Well, not you, obviously.
But some people.

33:30.925 --> 33:35.721
You think this is just a magazine?
This is not just a magazine.

33:35.930 --> 33:39.767
This is a shining beacon of hope for...

33:40.643 --> 33:41.894
Oh, I don't know.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.397
Let's say, a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...

33:45.564 --> 33:48.734
...pretending to go to soccer when he
was going to sewing class...

33:48.901 --> 33:52.071
...and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

33:52.279 --> 33:55.991
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls, and worse...

33:56.200 --> 33:58.786
...you don't care. Because this place...

33:58.994 --> 34:03.916
...where so many people would die
to work, you only deign to work.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.670
And you want to know why she
doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

34:07.878 --> 34:12.174
...and give you a gold star on your
homework at the end of the day.

34:13.967 --> 34:16.387
Wake up, sweetheart.

34:22.935 --> 34:25.312
Okay, so I'm screwing it up.

34:26.397 --> 34:30.985
I mean, I don't want to, I just wish
that I knew what I could do...

34:36.991 --> 34:40.161
Nigel? Nigel, Nigel.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.706
No.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.750
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

34:46.958 --> 34:50.670
There's nothing in this closet that'll
fit a size six, I can guarantee you.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.467
These are all sample sizes,
two and four.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.096
All right, we're doing this for you...

34:59.305 --> 35:01.140
- And...
- A poncho?

35:01.515 --> 35:03.809
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.645
We're doing this Dolce for you.

35:07.062 --> 35:09.857
And shoes...

35:10.065 --> 35:11.483
Jimmy Choos.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.904
Manolo Blahnik.

35:15.821 --> 35:18.866
Nancy Gonzalez, love that.

35:19.074 --> 35:21.327
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.914
- It might fit. It might.
- What?

35:25.122 --> 35:28.083
Okay, now Chanel. You're in
desperate need of Chanel.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.920
Shall we? We have to get
to the Beauty Department...

35:31.086 --> 35:34.048
...and God knows how long
that's going to take.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.801
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.638
Me neither. We were
in the Beauty Department...

35:40.846 --> 35:43.766
...and she held up the Shu Uemura
eyelash curler and said:

35:43.974 --> 35:45.726
"What is this?"

35:46.852 --> 35:49.522
I mean, I just knew from
the moment I saw her...

35:49.730 --> 35:52.483
...she was going to be
a complete and utter disas...

36:03.494 --> 36:04.912
Miranda Priestly's office.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.415
No, actually, she's not available
but I'll leave word.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.668
Okay, thanks. Bye.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.296
How did...?

36:15.798 --> 36:17.925
- Are you wearing the Ch...
- The Chanel boots?

36:18.133 --> 36:20.636
Yeah, I am.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.430
You look good.

36:25.724 --> 36:27.601
What?

36:28.519 --> 36:31.188
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.527
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man. Take it easy.

36:36.735 --> 36:38.946
Take care of that finger, huh?

36:56.130 --> 36:57.673
So...

36:59.008 --> 37:00.843
...what do you think?

37:02.887 --> 37:06.307
I think we better get out of here
before my girlfriend sees me.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.690
The gowns are fabulous, Ralph.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.985
We're gonna use the burgundy...

38:04.949 --> 38:07.159
...for the cover try...

38:11.330 --> 38:14.583
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.169
Take the fry and squeeze it.
See how firm that is?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.547
Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.133
There was a crisis
in the Accessories Department.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.262
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.057
I have exciting presents for all of you.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.434
Are you ready?

38:33.269 --> 38:36.522
- What is that?
- It's a Bang and Olufsen phone.

38:36.730 --> 38:39.191
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda
for her birthday.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.611
I looked it up online.
It's eleven hundred dollars.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.405
- What?
- Yep.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.783
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.285
A little Clinique.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.246
Oh, damn it, I love your job.

38:52.454 --> 38:53.831
Oh, one more...

38:54.039 --> 38:55.875
...little thing.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.587
- Do you want it? You want... Oh.
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!

38:59.753 --> 39:01.630
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God!

39:01.839 --> 39:04.758
This is the new Marc Jacobs!
This is sold out everywhere.

39:04.925 --> 39:08.095
- Where did you get this?
- Miranda didn't want it, so...

39:08.304 --> 39:13.184
Oh, no, no, no. This bag is, like,
$ 1900. I cannot take this from you.

39:13.559 --> 39:16.645
- Yeah, you can.
- Why do women need so many bags?

39:16.854 --> 39:19.273
- Shut up.
- You have one, you put all your junk...

39:19.481 --> 39:22.818
...in it, and that's it, you're done.
- Fashion is not about utility.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.571
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

39:25.738 --> 39:27.781
...used to express individual identity.

39:28.824 --> 39:31.285
- And it's pretty.
- That too.

39:31.494 --> 39:35.039
It turns out that there is more
to Runway than just fancy purses.

39:35.539 --> 39:39.126
Look. Here is an essay by Jay Mclnerney,
a piece by Joan Didion...

39:39.335 --> 39:42.379
...even an interview with
Christiane Amanpour.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.298
Someone's been
drinking the Kool-Aid.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.592
What are you...?

39:47.676 --> 39:48.802
- Nate.
- I got it.

39:48.969 --> 39:51.347
- It's... Yep, the dragon lady.
- Let me talk to her.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.476
- No. Okay, I need that. Lily, no, no, no!
- Tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

39:55.643 --> 40:01.232
It's gonna answer it! It's gonna
answer it! Gimme the phone! The phone.

40:03.275 --> 40:05.569
Hi, Miranda.

40:07.112 --> 40:08.489
Absolutely.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.700
I'm leaving right now.

40:12.660 --> 40:16.831
You know, you guys didn't
have to be such assholes.

40:48.696 --> 40:52.616
Excuse me.
I'm looking for James Holt.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.537
- That's him right there.
- Oh, oh, thanks.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.164
No problem.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.958
I put my stuff out there
and I pray they approve.

41:01.750 --> 41:06.005
Excuse me. I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.757
Oh, yes. You must be
the new Emily.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.302
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

41:11.510 --> 41:15.097
Oh, let me see that bag.
Very, very nice.

41:15.306 --> 41:19.101
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by
hand, finished with a metallic fringe.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.729
Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

41:22.980 --> 41:24.607
You.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.943
Duh. This way.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.825
Here we go. It's a sketch
of Miranda's dress for the benefit.

41:35.034 --> 41:38.287
Also the centerpiece of my spring
collection. Top-secret stuff.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.581
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

41:40.789 --> 41:45.336
Come on. You're working for Miranda,
you must be in need of hard liquor.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.840
Excuse us, girls.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.009
She'll have the punch.

41:55.721 --> 41:58.807
It's deadly. Have fun.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.314
He's right, you know.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.399
The punch.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.945
I drank it at his last party. I woke
up in Hoboken wearing nothing...

42:11.111 --> 42:13.531
...but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.033
Well.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.285
Wise.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.497
- Hi.
- Christian Thompson.

42:22.748 --> 42:25.251
Christian Thompson? You're kidding.

42:25.459 --> 42:28.879
No, you're... You write for, like,
every magazine I love.

42:29.088 --> 42:32.466
I reviewed your collection of essays
for my college newspaper.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.511
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

42:35.719 --> 42:37.847
- No, but...
- What do you do?

42:38.556 --> 42:44.103
Oh, well... I wanna work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.564
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

42:46.772 --> 42:48.774
I should read your stuff. Send it over.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.026
Yeah?

42:51.235 --> 42:53.404
That would... Thank you.
That would be great.

42:55.197 --> 42:58.492
Actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

42:58.701 --> 43:02.872
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad. That's... Whoa.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.040
You'll never survive Miranda.

43:06.792 --> 43:10.045
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

43:10.462 --> 43:12.256
You can't do that job.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.135
Gotta go.

43:16.343 --> 43:21.891
Okay. Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.616
Emily?

43:46.832 --> 43:50.002
Call James Holt's office. Tell them
I wanna move the preview up.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.089
Today at 12:30. Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.842
But we're not expected
until Tuesday.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.386
- Did she say why?
- Yes. She explained...

43:59.553 --> 44:03.224
...every detail of her decision-making.
Then we brushed each other's hair...

44:03.390 --> 44:06.393
...and gabbed about American Idol.
- I see your point.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.146
- What's a preview, anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.

44:09.355 --> 44:13.526
Miranda insists on seeing the designer's
collections before they show them.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.361
- Great to see you again.
- Hello.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.447
- And she tells them what she thinks?
- In her way.

44:18.656 --> 44:22.034
This season really began for me
with a meditation...

44:22.243 --> 44:24.787
...on the intersection
between East and West.

44:24.995 --> 44:28.374
There's a scale. One nod is good.
Two nods, very good.

44:28.958 --> 44:32.628
There's only been one actual smile on
record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.171
An obi belt.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.924
If she doesn 't like it,
she shakes her head.

44:37.132 --> 44:40.761
This is the dress we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.597
Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.683
Which means...?

44:50.145 --> 44:51.730
Catastrophe.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.067
Just... Just go.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.279
- I know.
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.448
- Appalled. I'll talk to him.
- You deal with it.

45:01.740 --> 45:05.411
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

45:05.619 --> 45:07.413
You still don't get it, do you?

45:07.621 --> 45:10.833
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.921
- Call my husband and confirm dinner...
- At Pastis? Done.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.798
And I'll need a change of clothes.

45:18.007 --> 45:21.510
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

45:23.095 --> 45:27.641
Fine. And Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.269
Have Emily give you the key.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.733
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

45:36.609 --> 45:40.654
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that
means I must've done something right.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.656
I'm not a psycho.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.617
And, you know she called me Andrea?

45:44.825 --> 45:47.828
I mean, she didn't call me Emily.
Isn't that great?

45:48.037 --> 45:50.122
Yeah, whoopee.

45:52.833 --> 45:56.962
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.006
Oh, okay.

45:59.215 --> 46:02.259
The Book is assembled by 10, 10:30...

46:02.426 --> 46:04.595
...and you must wait around for it
until then.

46:06.013 --> 46:09.433
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry-cleaning with the Book.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.523
Now, the car will take you
straight to Miranda 's townhouse.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.025
You let yourself in.

46:20.152 --> 46:25.783
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.
You do not look at anyone.

46:25.991 --> 46:31.038
This is of the utmost importance. You
must be invisible. Do you understand?

46:31.247 --> 46:34.458
You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.

46:34.667 --> 46:39.755
You hang the dry-cleaning in the closet
across from the staircase.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.849
And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.

46:57.022 --> 46:59.984
- Shit.
- It's that door to the left.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.615
Okay.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.874
Thank you.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.877
You can give the Book to us.

47:18.961 --> 47:21.589
- Which...? Which table?
- It's okay. Come on up.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.133
- No, I can't. I can't.
- What? It's okay. Come on.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.678
- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.

47:27.887 --> 47:31.015
Or you could bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

47:31.182 --> 47:35.436
She does? Right. She does.
All the time.

47:35.644 --> 47:38.606
Yeah? Okay.

47:45.404 --> 47:48.449
What did you expect me to do,
walk out in the middle of a shoot?

47:48.616 --> 47:50.993
I rushed out of an
investment committee meeting.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.746
- And I sat there waiting.
- I told you cell phones...

47:53.954 --> 47:55.456
...didn't work. No signals.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.958
I knew everyone in the restaurant
was thinking:

47:58.125 --> 48:01.128
"There he is, waiting for her again."

48:25.945 --> 48:27.321
Okay, okay.

48:27.488 --> 48:30.157
Okay, okay. It really wasn't
that big a deal. I promise.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.743
The twins said hello,
I said hello back and then...

48:32.910 --> 48:34.703
...I went up to give her the Book...

48:35.204 --> 48:37.331
You went upstairs?
You went upstairs. My God.

48:37.498 --> 48:41.001
Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

48:41.210 --> 48:44.088
Okay. Okay.
I made a mistake. I know.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.881
Andrea, you don't understand.

48:46.090 --> 48:49.260
If you get fired, that might
jeopardize Paris. If that happens...

48:49.426 --> 48:52.263
...I'll search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area for you.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.890
Hold on. She's gonna fire me?

48:55.057 --> 48:58.686
I don't know. She's not happy.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.229
Andrea.

49:10.823 --> 49:13.993
- Miranda, about last night, I'm...
- I need the Harry Potter book...

49:14.160 --> 49:15.411
...for the twins.

49:15.995 --> 49:18.622
Okay. Okay, I'll go down
to Barnes and Noble right now.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.668
Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?

49:24.628 --> 49:27.631
- Not that I can recall.
- We have all the published books.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.467
The twins want to know
what happens next.

49:31.927 --> 49:34.054
You want the unpublished manuscript?

49:34.221 --> 49:37.600
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

49:37.766 --> 49:40.269
And you can do anything, right?

49:48.194 --> 49:49.653
Yes, Bobbsey?

49:49.820 --> 49:53.449
I know, baby. Mommy's working
very hard to get it for you.

49:53.657 --> 49:57.286
She doesn't get it. You know, I could
call fricking J. K. Rowling herself.

49:57.453 --> 49:59.371
I'm not gonna get a copy
of that book.

49:59.580 --> 50:04.251
My girls leave for their grandmother's
at 4 so the book better be here by 3.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.254
- Of course.
- And I would like my steak here...

50:07.463 --> 50:09.006
...in 15 minutes.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.175
No problem.

50:11.884 --> 50:15.846
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.349
Smith and Wollensky's
doesn't open until 11:30.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.142
How am I gonna get the steak?

50:20.309 --> 50:24.230
Okay. I will be back
in 15 minutes. Wish me luck.

50:24.438 --> 50:25.606
No, shan't.

50:25.815 --> 50:29.693
Yes, yes, yes, I've been on hold.
Well, it's for Miranda Priestly.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.278
It's very important.

50:31.445 --> 50:35.658
Yes, I know. I know it's impossible
to get, but, well, I was wondering...

50:35.825 --> 50:39.787
...if you could make the impossible
possible, if that's at all possible?

50:39.995 --> 50:43.249
Yes, I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.293
No. Unpublished.

50:46.710 --> 50:50.798
Not a chance? Could you tell her
that it's for Miranda Priestly?

50:51.006 --> 50:53.008
Because I think it makes a difference.

50:58.347 --> 51:01.517
Let me call you back.
Hi. You probably don't remember me.

51:01.684 --> 51:04.854
We met at James Holt's party.
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.983
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

51:09.150 --> 51:11.402
Sorry to ask, but I am desperate.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.989
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a plan B.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.324
This is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.827
There is no plan B.
There's only plan A.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.872
Is she back? Am I fired?

51:23.038 --> 51:26.417
You know, I rarely say this
to people who aren't me...

51:26.584 --> 51:31.088
...but you have got to calm down.
Bloody hell.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.596
Coat, bag.

51:40.556 --> 51:42.933
What's that? Oh, I don't want that.

51:43.100 --> 51:47.855
I'm having lunch with Irv. I'll be back
at 3. I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

51:49.899 --> 51:53.027
And if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then...

51:53.235 --> 51:55.779
...don't even bother coming back.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.377
Hello?

52:11.212 --> 52:13.005
Quit? Are you sure?

52:13.214 --> 52:17.718
I failed. She's gonna fire me anyway.
I might as well beat her to the punch.

52:17.927 --> 52:21.639
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

52:21.847 --> 52:25.518
- Yeah, well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.480
- Hello?
- I'm brilliant. No, really.

52:29.939 --> 52:32.775
Monuments should be
erected in my honor.

52:32.942 --> 52:34.652
- You didn't.
- Oh, yes.

52:34.819 --> 52:39.490
Friend of a friend does the cover art,
and she happens to have the manuscript.

52:40.157 --> 52:45.621
Oh, no, because that would mean
that I actually did something right.

52:45.788 --> 52:47.790
It's just...

52:47.957 --> 52:50.000
The thing is, Christian, I was just...

52:50.209 --> 52:54.588
Look, you want this thing, you better
hurry. I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.181
Excuse me.

53:14.859 --> 53:17.111
Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you?

53:17.278 --> 53:19.989
Yes, I'm meeting someone
at the King Cole Bar.

53:20.156 --> 53:22.032
Right this way.

53:25.411 --> 53:28.247
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.

53:37.923 --> 53:42.720
One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

53:42.928 --> 53:45.306
Oh, no, I made two copies.
And had them covered...

53:45.472 --> 53:48.267
...reset and bound so they
wouldn't look like manuscripts.

53:48.475 --> 53:51.937
This is an extra copy to have on file,
you know, just in case.

53:52.104 --> 53:55.232
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

53:57.776 --> 54:01.280
They're with the twins. You know,
on the train on the way to Grandma 's.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.242
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

54:09.538 --> 54:11.081
That's all.

54:11.499 --> 54:12.833
Okay.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.477
- Hey.
- Hey, I went to Dean and DeLuca.

54:31.644 --> 54:35.981
Man, they charge, like,
$5 a strawberry there. But I figure...

54:36.315 --> 54:38.359
...since you quit your job...

54:38.943 --> 54:40.486
...we should celebrate.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.279
Listen, Nate...

54:42.696 --> 54:47.493
Wait, you quit your job, but you're still
working on the twins' science project?

54:49.495 --> 54:54.750
- Well, that's big of you.
- Okay, after we talked, I realized...

54:54.959 --> 54:59.922
...it doesn't make sense throwing away
all those months of hard work.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.049
I had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

55:02.216 --> 55:05.803
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks
and your boss is a wacko.

55:08.681 --> 55:10.599
All right.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.019
Whatever. It's your job.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.565
Nate.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.109
Come on.

55:20.276 --> 55:22.111
I'm still the same person I was.

55:22.278 --> 55:26.115
I still want the same things. Okay?

55:26.282 --> 55:30.161
I promise. Same Andy. Better clothes.

55:31.579 --> 55:33.414
I liked the old clothes.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.500
Really?

55:37.459 --> 55:40.754
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

55:41.380 --> 55:45.593
No? And this dress? It's new.

55:48.596 --> 55:51.265
Well, there is one other thing
that's new...

55:51.432 --> 55:54.518
...that I thought you might like, but...

55:55.811 --> 55:57.188
What about this?

55:59.273 --> 56:02.109
You don't like it,
I should better do the twins'...

56:21.962 --> 56:24.882
Is this number two look?
This is number two?

56:25.508 --> 56:29.512
- Hi.
- Hi. All right, turn around for me, darling.

56:29.720 --> 56:33.015
Oh, I get it. I get it. The piece
is called "Urban Jungle," right?

56:33.182 --> 56:36.393
Yes. The modern woman
unleashes the animal within...

56:36.560 --> 56:38.479
...to take on the big city.

56:38.646 --> 56:40.272
Good. Go.

56:41.190 --> 56:45.319
Sometimes I can't believe I talk about
this crap all day. Bobby, come here.

56:45.486 --> 56:47.446
- Thanks.
- Make sure Miranda gets these...

56:47.613 --> 56:51.408
...as soon as possible. And tell her that I
switched in the Dior for the Rocha.

56:52.785 --> 56:54.829
Great, can't wait.

56:54.995 --> 56:58.207
- Excuse me. Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.

56:58.374 --> 57:01.210
Don't make me feed you
to one of the models.

57:01.752 --> 57:05.589
It's a busy day. And my personal life
is hanging by a thread, that's all.

57:05.756 --> 57:10.219
Well, join the club. That happens when
you start doing well at work, darling.

57:10.386 --> 57:12.763
Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.807
That means it's time for a promotion.

57:22.398 --> 57:25.401
No. All right, February.
Back of the issue.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.736
Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?

57:27.903 --> 57:30.906
Yes. She'd rather do a summer cover,
because she has a movie...

57:31.115 --> 57:35.202
No. Also I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women.

57:36.162 --> 57:39.582
Woman. And I need to see a new draft
on that piece about shopping...

57:39.748 --> 57:41.959
...for a plastic surgeon. It's dull.

57:42.710 --> 57:46.505
And this layout for
the "Winter Wonderland" spread...

57:46.672 --> 57:49.049
Not wonderful yet.

57:49.258 --> 57:51.677
- Okay, I'll look at it.
- What about Testino?

57:51.844 --> 57:53.637
- Where are we on that?
- Zac Posen's...

57:53.846 --> 57:56.223
...doing some sculptural suits,
so I suggested...

57:56.390 --> 57:58.809
...that Testino shoot them
at the Noguchi Garden.

57:59.185 --> 58:00.686
Perfect.

58:00.895 --> 58:04.982
Thank God somebody came to work
today. What about accessories for April?

58:05.149 --> 58:09.820
One thought I had was enamel:
Bangles, pendants, earrings...

58:10.029 --> 58:12.031
No, we did that two years ago.
What else?

58:12.239 --> 58:15.451
They're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking I...

58:15.659 --> 58:19.955
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

58:20.164 --> 58:23.751
We thought of shooting them in an
industrial space. The contrast between...

58:23.918 --> 58:27.254
...the feminine florals, and the
rough-hewn background would create...

58:27.463 --> 58:29.965
...this wonderful tension with...
- No.

58:30.132 --> 58:32.927
Which would...

58:39.600 --> 58:42.645
Does anybody else have
anything I can possibly use?

58:43.562 --> 58:46.565
Antibacterial wipes, perhaps?

58:50.986 --> 58:55.282
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up, actually.

58:56.909 --> 59:00.454
God. It's the benefit tonight. I've been
looking forward to it for months.

59:00.621 --> 59:04.166
I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing
Valentino, for crying out loud.

59:05.626 --> 59:09.213
Right. Well, everybody will be
leaving soon to get ready...

59:09.380 --> 59:13.342
...so I suggest you go drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...

59:13.509 --> 59:15.219
...then I suppose you can go home.

59:15.427 --> 59:19.139
Yeah? Oh, wow, that is great.

59:19.306 --> 59:22.810
Perfect, actually. I need to get to
Magnolia Bakery before it closes.

59:22.977 --> 59:26.689
It's Nate's birthday tonight. So we're
having a little party for him, and...

59:26.897 --> 59:29.859
Yeah, I'm hearing this:
And I wanna hear this:

59:31.277 --> 59:33.028
Bye.

59:34.572 --> 59:38.117
I love my job,
I love my job, I love my job.

59:46.417 --> 59:48.085
Hello?

59:51.922 --> 59:55.426
Before the benefit tonight,
I need to make sure that you're both...

59:55.593 --> 59:57.636
...fully prepped on the guest list.

59:58.554 --> 01:00:02.600
But I thought that only the first
assistant went to the benefit.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.478
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:08.481
...an incubus of viral plague.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:12.234
You'll come and help Emily.

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:14.487
That's all.

01:00:15.196 --> 01:00:17.990
Right. These are all of the guests.

01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:21.494
Miranda invites everyone. We have
to make sure that they all think...

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:23.537
...that she knows
exactly who they are.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:25.789
And I've been studying for weeks.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:30.753
- I have to learn all these by tonight?
- Now, don't be silly, Andrea. These too.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.006
Better start without me.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:37.051
Andy, come on, it's his birth...

01:00:37.218 --> 01:00:39.261
Okay, but hurry.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.097
Believe me, I will.
This is the last thing I want to...

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:46.018
I love that. I'll call you
the second I'm leaving, okay?

01:00:46.519 --> 01:00:48.604
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:52.441
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.387
Nothing really. This is...
I mean, really, this is...

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:25.182
...the social event
of the season, and...

01:01:40.406 --> 01:01:43.784
Oh, my God. Andy, you look so chic.

01:01:43.993 --> 01:01:47.538
Thanks, Em. You look so thin.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.081
- Do I?
- Yeah.

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:52.126
It's for Paris. I'm on this new diet.
It's very effective.

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:55.629
I don't eat anything, and then
when I feel like I'm about to faint...

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:58.674
...I eat a cube of cheese.
- Well, it's definitely working.

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:02.178
I know. I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:22.573
That's John Folger, the new artistic
director of the Chelsea Rep.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.116
- John.
- Hey there.

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:27.036
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks. It's always nice seeing you.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.288
Stop fidgeting.

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:31.248
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.375
Just deal with it. You have to be here.

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:40.966
Emily. Come here.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.886
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet
from French Runway?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.846
Oh, my God, Miranda hates her.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.182
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:49.809
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:52.937
Miranda. Fabulous event, as always.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.605
You've brought Jacqueline.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:04.323
Wonderful. We're so happy that you
were able to come to our little gathering.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:07.785
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

01:03:08.536 --> 01:03:12.706
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:17.294
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:18.754
Yes, I did.

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:21.173
- We'll discuss it on Wednesday.
- Yes, I agree.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.175
- No business tonight.
- Not tonight.

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:24.844
Enjoy.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:29.640
- Em?
- Oh, great. Thanks.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.647
Oh... Oh, my God.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:39.150
I can't... I just can't remember
what his name is.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.361
I saw his name this morning on the list.
It's... Oh, I know this.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:45.281
It's something to do with...
Wait, he was part of the...

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:47.491
Oh, God, I know this. It's...

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.786
It's Ambassador Franklin.

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.664
And that's the woman
that he left his wife for, Rebecca.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.710
Rebecca.

01:03:57.877 --> 01:04:00.421
- Ambassador.
- Miranda, you look fabulous.

01:04:00.588 --> 01:04:03.299
- You're very kind.
- Thank you.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:08.220
Welcome back to civilization.
You must be so relieved.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.060
- Look at you.
- Hello.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:18.063
You're... You're a vision.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:20.065
Thank God I saved your job.

01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:24.904
Okay. You know, I figured out
a few things on my own too.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.490
Turns out, I'm not as nice
as you thought.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:28.782
I hope not.

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:32.203
Wow, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.122
...I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:39.668
Do you actually
say things like that to people?

01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:41.629
Evidently.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.130
Well, I gotta go.

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:46.467
Are you sure? Because my editor
for New York magazine is inside.

01:04:46.634 --> 01:04:48.552
You know, I could introduce you two.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.640
You sent over your stuff for me
to look at, I... Remember?

01:04:52.807 --> 01:04:54.475
- Yeah.
- All right, I gotta admit...

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:57.937
...I only read a couple because
it was a very large packet you sent.

01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.980
But what I did read wasn't half bad.

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:02.650
You know, I think...
I think you have a talent, Andy.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.611
He should meet you.
Why don't you come in?

01:05:05.778 --> 01:05:07.738
Just for one drink.

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:11.033
Okay. Yeah, I guess I could for one...

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:15.287
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:18.916
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:28.425
Roy, I'm sorry. Can you go any faster?

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.262
I'm sure Nate will understand.

01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:35.349
Yeah.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:40.187
Hey.

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.580
Happy birthday.

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:04.420
Nate, I'm so sorry.

01:06:04.587 --> 01:06:08.716
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on...

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:10.885
...and you know
I didn't have a choice.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:13.262
Don't worry about it.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.015
I'm going to bed.

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:19.393
Can we at least talk about this?

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:30.946
You look really pretty.

01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:14.406
Andrea?

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:27.753
Do you have the Book?

01:07:34.802 --> 01:07:38.305
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.

01:07:38.514 --> 01:07:41.976
I need the best possible team
with me.

01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:45.187
That no longer includes Emily.

01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:50.067
Wait, you... You want me to...?

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:56.282
No. Miranda, I... Emily would die.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:59.201
Her whole life is about Paris.

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:01.495
She hasn't eaten in weeks, I...

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:06.500
I can't do that, Miranda, I can't.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:10.171
If you don't go, I'll assume
you're not serious about your future.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:14.675
At Runway or any other publication.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:22.265
The decision's yours.

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:25.895
- But...
- That's all.

01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:29.625
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.669
You coming to bed anytime soon?

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.296
Yeah, five minutes, okay?

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:31.937
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.567
Do it now.

01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:48.662
Don't pick up.

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:50.247
Don't pick up. Don't pick up.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:51.457
- Don't pick...
- Hi.

01:10:51.624 --> 01:10:53.375
- Emily.
- Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.086
It's just, Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.756
She did tell me yesterday.
I forgot, like an idiot.

01:10:58.923 --> 01:11:03.010
- So I freaked out, of course.
- Emily... Emily, I need to talk to you.

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:05.846
I called Martine at home
and she opened the shop early...

01:11:06.013 --> 01:11:09.600
I'm sorry. She opened the shop early
for me, so I got them, which is great.

01:11:09.809 --> 01:11:12.561
Yeah, okay, Emily,
when you come in...

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:15.147
...there's something
I have to talk to you about.

01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:18.400
- I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:21.529
Well, good, because I've got
so much to deal with before I go.

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:23.322
I swear to God, I mean...

01:11:27.493 --> 01:11:28.911
Oh, my God!

01:11:29.537 --> 01:11:30.871
Emily?

01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:44.176
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a red-hot poker...

01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:45.761
...you should have said no.

01:11:45.928 --> 01:11:49.598
Emily, I didn't have a choice.
You know how she is.

01:11:49.765 --> 01:11:52.726
Please, that is a pathetic excuse.

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:57.982
Thanks.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:03.946
Do you know what really just gets me
about this whole thing?

01:12:04.113 --> 01:12:06.323
Is that, you know,
you're the one who said...

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.826
...that you don't really care
about this stuff.

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:12.329
You don't really care about fashion,
you just wanna be a journalist.

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:14.290
Oh, what a pile of bollocks!

01:12:14.456 --> 01:12:16.458
I know you're mad,
I don't blame you.

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:20.671
Face it, Andy, you sold your soul the day
you put on that pair of Jimmy Choos.

01:12:20.838 --> 01:12:25.426
I saw it. And do you know what really
just kills me about this whole thing?

01:12:25.593 --> 01:12:30.389
Is the clothes that you're gonna get,
I mean, you don't deserve them.

01:12:30.556 --> 01:12:33.392
You eat carbs, for chrissake!

01:12:33.726 --> 01:12:35.186
God!

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:37.521
It's so unfair.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:40.232
- Emily...
- Just go.

01:12:46.489 --> 01:12:49.325
- Emily, I...
- I said, go.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.832
You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?

01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:59.126
That's the coolest fashion event
of the year.

01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:02.421
- Who are you gonna see, Galliano?
- Yeah.

01:13:02.588 --> 01:13:04.173
- And Lagerfeld?
- Yep.

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:08.093
- And Nicolas Ghesquière.
- Ye... Okay, now you're scaring me.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:14.308
This show is amazing.
I am so proud of you.

01:13:14.475 --> 01:13:15.559
Thank you.

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:18.437
Start with the photos in the back,
work your way forward.

01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:21.023
The way I designed it.
Brilliant. You will love it.

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:23.067
- Of course.
- And you...

01:13:23.234 --> 01:13:25.027
...I have somebody
I want you to meet.

01:13:25.194 --> 01:13:26.612
Art and sex. Lead the way.

01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:28.948
- See you later.
- Okay.

01:13:47.716 --> 01:13:49.593
Hey.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.887
Hey, Miranda girl.

01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:55.099
Hi.

01:13:55.266 --> 01:13:56.892
I was just thinking about you.

01:13:57.059 --> 01:13:58.894
Oh, come on.

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:00.437
- It's true.
- No.

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:03.065
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview.

01:14:03.232 --> 01:14:05.401
And making my Paris plans...

01:14:05.568 --> 01:14:10.030
...I found myself wondering
if you were gonna be there.

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:15.327
Well, actually, I am going.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:16.954
Great.

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:20.332
I'm staying at a fantastic little hotel
in the seventh.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:24.211
Right across the street from a falafel
restaurant that will change your life.

01:14:26.172 --> 01:14:29.258
I'm sorry, I'll be too busy working.

01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:32.011
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.639
Well, that's just it.

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:38.434
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

01:14:51.363 --> 01:14:52.656
Lily.

01:14:54.033 --> 01:14:56.035
Lily, he's just a guy
I know from work.

01:14:56.202 --> 01:14:59.246
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- You're making a big deal out of...

01:14:59.413 --> 01:15:02.708
You know, the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate...

01:15:03.334 --> 01:15:05.044
...is always five minutes early...

01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:07.838
...and thinks, I don't know,
Club Monaco is couture.

01:15:08.464 --> 01:15:11.467
For the last 16 years,
I've known everything about that Andy.

01:15:11.634 --> 01:15:12.968
But this person?

01:15:13.135 --> 01:15:15.429
This glamazon
who skulks around in corners...

01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:17.389
...with some random,
hot fashion guy?

01:15:18.724 --> 01:15:20.893
I don't get her.

01:15:21.769 --> 01:15:24.480
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.

01:15:25.856 --> 01:15:27.775
You're going to Paris?

01:15:28.818 --> 01:15:30.736
Yeah, it just happened.

01:15:31.529 --> 01:15:34.323
I thought Paris was a big deal
for Emily or...

01:15:34.824 --> 01:15:37.284
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?

01:15:39.245 --> 01:15:40.830
Hey, Andy.

01:15:40.996 --> 01:15:42.623
Andy!

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.835
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I didn't have a choice.

01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.170
- Miranda asked me. I couldn't say no.
- I know.

01:15:48.337 --> 01:15:50.840
Your answer for everything:
"I didn't have a choice."

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:54.134
Like this job was forced on you,
like you don't make decisions.

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:58.097
You're mad because I work late and
I missed your birthday party. I'm sorry.

01:15:58.264 --> 01:16:02.226
- Oh, come on, what am I, 4?
- You... You hate Runway. And Miranda.

01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:05.354
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.

01:16:05.521 --> 01:16:08.566
Andy, I make
port-wine reductions all day.

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:10.651
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

01:16:10.818 --> 01:16:14.029
You know, I wouldn't care
if you were out pole-dancing all night...

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:16.657
...as long as you did it
with a little integrity.

01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:18.534
You used to say this was just a job.

01:16:18.701 --> 01:16:20.703
You used to make fun
of the Runway girls.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.038
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.

01:16:24.373 --> 01:16:26.750
- That's absurd.
- Hey, that's okay, that's fine.

01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:28.294
Just own up to it.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.173
And then we can stop pretending like
we have anything in common anymore.

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:35.968
- You don't mean that, you...
- No, I do.

01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:47.021
Well, maybe this trip
is coming at a good time.

01:16:47.188 --> 01:16:49.607
Maybe we should take a break.

01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:58.532
Nate?

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:11.921
I'm sorry. Just one second.

01:17:13.923 --> 01:17:16.050
You know, in case
you were wondering...

01:17:16.217 --> 01:17:18.344
...the person whose calls
you always take...

01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:20.346
...that's the relationship you're in.

01:17:20.513 --> 01:17:23.265
I hope you two
are very happy together.

01:17:31.565 --> 01:17:33.859
Hello, Miranda.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.226
Miranda.

01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:55.274
How are you? So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.

01:18:55.483 --> 01:18:57.943
- Do you like the collection?
- Absolutely.

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:00.863
This is very important.
Very, very important.

01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:02.865
This is my new Emily.

01:19:03.032 --> 01:19:04.241
Hello. How do you do?

01:19:04.408 --> 01:19:05.993
- I'm good.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.786
- A pleasure.
- You love the show?

01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:16.462
- Miranda. This way, please.
- This way.

01:19:21.926 --> 01:19:24.929
Miranda. Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.

01:19:25.095 --> 01:19:30.100
Miranda, what is Runway's position on
French fashion versus American fashion?

01:19:30.976 --> 01:19:34.438
I've been thinking.
You still owe me for Harry Potter.

01:19:34.605 --> 01:19:36.482
- Oh, do I?
- Of course you do.

01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:38.567
Are you working tonight?

01:19:39.944 --> 01:19:43.155
- No, actually, Miranda has a dinner.
- Great, you're free.

01:19:43.322 --> 01:19:46.408
Oh, but there is the problem
of le boyfriend.

01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:50.287
Wait, don't tell me,
the boyfriend non plus?

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.167
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:57.837
Not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.131
I'll call you.

01:20:01.674 --> 01:20:03.926
Christian, photo!

01:20:25.239 --> 01:20:27.658
Oh, there you are.

01:20:28.951 --> 01:20:34.206
We need to go over the seating chart.

01:20:34.415 --> 01:20:37.960
- For the luncheon.
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

01:20:38.127 --> 01:20:41.046
I have it right here.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.635
By all means, move at a glacial pace.

01:20:46.802 --> 01:20:48.679
You know how that thrills me.

01:20:56.187 --> 01:21:00.316
Okay. So...

01:21:01.192 --> 01:21:06.989
...first of all, we need to move
Snoop Dogg to my table.

01:21:07.156 --> 01:21:08.574
But your table's full.

01:21:10.367 --> 01:21:12.077
Stephen isn't coming.

01:21:12.786 --> 01:21:15.080
Oh, Stephen is...

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:19.168
So I don't need to fetch Stephen
from the airport tomorrow?

01:21:19.835 --> 01:21:23.547
Well, if you speak to him
and he decides to rethink the divorce...

01:21:23.714 --> 01:21:26.175
...then yes, fetch away.

01:21:26.842 --> 01:21:30.930
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:42.358
And then, when we get back to
New York, we need to contact Leslie...

01:21:42.983 --> 01:21:48.322
...and see what she can do
to minimize the press on all this.

01:21:51.784 --> 01:21:54.203
Another divorce.

01:21:54.370 --> 01:21:57.414
Splashed across "Page Six."

01:21:57.623 --> 01:22:00.626
I can just imagine
what they're gonna write about me:

01:22:00.793 --> 01:22:04.713
"The Dragon Lady. Career-obsessed.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.425
Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly."

01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:14.807
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check
for all the papers I sell for him.

01:22:16.767 --> 01:22:18.936
Anyway, I don't...

01:22:19.103 --> 01:22:22.606
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.

01:22:24.692 --> 01:22:30.030
But my... My girls, I just...
It's just so unfair to the girls.

01:22:30.197 --> 01:22:32.658
And it's just...

01:22:35.411 --> 01:22:37.163
...another disappointment.

01:22:37.329 --> 01:22:41.083
Another letdown.
Another father. Figure.

01:22:42.084 --> 01:22:43.878
Gone.

01:22:45.379 --> 01:22:48.090
Anyway, the point is...

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:51.427
The point is...

01:22:53.262 --> 01:22:57.433
The point is, we really need to figure out
where to place Donatella...

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.895
...because she's barely
speaking to anyone.

01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:13.157
I'm so sorry, Miranda.

01:23:13.324 --> 01:23:15.784
If you want me
to cancel your evening, I can.

01:23:15.993 --> 01:23:19.121
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:24.627
Is there anything else I can do?

01:23:26.212 --> 01:23:28.130
Your job.

01:23:31.175 --> 01:23:33.219
That's all.

01:23:59.286 --> 01:24:01.622
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.

01:24:01.789 --> 01:24:03.374
- Okay. Come in.
- All right.

01:24:08.254 --> 01:24:09.713
Who put that together for you?

01:24:10.923 --> 01:24:14.176
Oh, this isn't...
It's just something I threw on.

01:24:14.343 --> 01:24:17.263
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.

01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:23.769
- It's really just... No, it's... No.
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay, good.

01:24:23.936 --> 01:24:27.314
Gorgeous. Really.
I think that my work here is done.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.695
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.

01:24:32.862 --> 01:24:34.488
Okay. What are we toasting?

01:24:34.655 --> 01:24:39.493
We're toasting, my dear,
to the dream job.

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.788
The one that a million girls wanted.

01:24:42.955 --> 01:24:44.874
Which I got months ago.

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:48.711
I'm not talking about you.

01:24:51.714 --> 01:24:54.175
- James Holt.
- Yeah.

01:24:54.341 --> 01:25:00.556
Massimo Corteleoni is investing
in James' company and talking it global.

01:25:00.723 --> 01:25:04.226
Bags, shoes, fragrances, the works.

01:25:05.186 --> 01:25:08.647
And James needs a partner.

01:25:08.814 --> 01:25:14.570
And that partner would be me.

01:25:16.822 --> 01:25:18.616
- Does Miranda...?
- No, Miranda knows...

01:25:18.782 --> 01:25:21.744
...because she put me up for it.
Oh, God, no. Can you imagine?

01:25:22.161 --> 01:25:24.246
But... But... But you're leaving.

01:25:25.498 --> 01:25:28.792
- I can't imagine Runway without you.
- I know.

01:25:28.959 --> 01:25:32.505
I'm so excited, though!
For the first time in 18 years...

01:25:32.671 --> 01:25:34.673
...I'll call the shots in my own life.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.218
Oh, my God!

01:25:37.384 --> 01:25:42.348
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.561
Well, congratulations.

01:25:47.728 --> 01:25:50.564
Nigel, you deserve it.

01:25:52.525 --> 01:25:55.027
You bet your size-six ass.

01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:59.782
- Four.
- Really?

01:25:59.949 --> 01:26:03.702
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.

01:26:03.869 --> 01:26:07.164
- To us.
- Let me see that.

01:26:10.876 --> 01:26:12.545
Okay, I just wanna say that, yes...

01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:15.631
...there are things Miranda does
that I don't agree with...

01:26:15.798 --> 01:26:17.800
Come on, you hate her.
Just admit it to me.

01:26:17.967 --> 01:26:20.845
- No.
- She's a notorious sadist.

01:26:21.011 --> 01:26:23.139
And not... Not in a good way.

01:26:23.347 --> 01:26:26.308
Okay, she's tough.
But if Miranda were a man...

01:26:26.475 --> 01:26:30.187
...no one would notice anything about
her except how great she is at her job.

01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:33.983
I'm sorry, I can't... I can't believe this.

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:36.193
- You're defending her?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.738
The wide-eyed girl,
peddling her earnest newspaper stories?

01:26:40.364 --> 01:26:42.992
You, my friend,
are crossing over to the dark side.

01:26:45.161 --> 01:26:46.537
I resent that.

01:26:46.704 --> 01:26:49.790
- You shouldn't. It's sexy.
- Sexy?

01:26:52.751 --> 01:26:55.796
- Really?
- Really.

01:27:00.968 --> 01:27:03.554
So do you...? Do you know
where we're going? Because...

01:27:03.721 --> 01:27:04.763
- Yeah.
...I'm lost.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:07.558
Don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.

01:27:07.725 --> 01:27:10.186
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.

01:27:10.352 --> 01:27:12.521
You know, Gertrude Stein once said:

01:27:12.688 --> 01:27:16.984
"America is my country,
and Paris is my hometown."

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.279
It's true.

01:27:20.446 --> 01:27:23.282
What do you do?
Do you just write stuff like that down...

01:27:23.449 --> 01:27:26.911
...and then file it away
to use on us girls?

01:27:27.077 --> 01:27:28.871
I'm Christian Thompson.
That's my way.

01:27:29.038 --> 01:27:30.456
That's your way. Right.

01:27:30.623 --> 01:27:33.292
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

01:27:35.169 --> 01:27:37.755
You know, I never understood...

01:27:37.922 --> 01:27:40.925
...why everyone
was so crazy about Paris.

01:27:41.091 --> 01:27:47.056
But it is so beautiful.

01:27:50.226 --> 01:27:54.396
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't, I...

01:27:54.605 --> 01:27:58.359
You know, Nate and I just split up
a couple of days ago, and I can't...

01:28:02.363 --> 01:28:05.658
I've had too much wine
and my hearing... Vision...

01:28:05.825 --> 01:28:08.160
Judgment's impaired.

01:28:10.788 --> 01:28:15.000
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.839
I am out of excuses.

01:28:20.297 --> 01:28:21.674
Thank God.

01:29:10.181 --> 01:29:12.349
Yes.

01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:30.534
Oh, hi. What the hell is this?

01:29:30.701 --> 01:29:33.871
What does it look like? It's a mockup.

01:29:34.371 --> 01:29:36.081
Yeah. Of...?

01:29:36.248 --> 01:29:38.167
Of what American Runway
will look like...

01:29:38.334 --> 01:29:41.337
...when Jacqueline Follet
is the new editor in chief.

01:29:43.047 --> 01:29:44.548
They're replacing Miranda?

01:29:44.715 --> 01:29:48.427
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

01:29:50.805 --> 01:29:52.807
You're really surprised?

01:29:52.973 --> 01:29:56.852
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

01:29:57.561 --> 01:30:01.106
Not to mention that American Runway
is one of the most expensive books...

01:30:01.273 --> 01:30:02.608
...in the business.

01:30:02.775 --> 01:30:06.570
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.

01:30:06.737 --> 01:30:10.241
And Irv's a businessman, you know.

01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:13.577
Miranda will be devastated.
Her whole life is about Runway.

01:30:13.744 --> 01:30:15.454
- He can't do that to her.
- It's done.

01:30:15.621 --> 01:30:18.207
Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party for James.

01:30:18.874 --> 01:30:20.334
And she has no idea?

01:30:20.835 --> 01:30:22.920
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

01:30:25.923 --> 01:30:27.258
I have to go.

01:30:27.424 --> 01:30:31.262
Andy. Andy, it's done.

01:30:32.555 --> 01:30:33.889
Baby, it's done.

01:30:35.307 --> 01:30:37.560
I'm not your baby.

01:30:49.238 --> 01:30:52.283
- Oh, thank God. You're there.
- Excuse me?

01:30:52.449 --> 01:30:56.036
I need to talk to you right away.
It's about Jacqueline Follet. She's...

01:30:56.996 --> 01:31:00.708
Damn. Shit, shit, shit.

01:31:16.807 --> 01:31:18.142
- Yes?
- Oh, hello.

01:31:18.309 --> 01:31:21.228
Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I was wondering...

01:31:21.395 --> 01:31:23.647
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:31:23.814 --> 01:31:25.399
I need to talk to you.

01:31:25.566 --> 01:31:31.030
- Do not disturb me again.
- But... It's just... Miranda!

01:31:48.798 --> 01:31:50.132
Miranda?

01:31:50.299 --> 01:31:52.968
Miranda. Wait, I need to talk to you.

01:31:53.135 --> 01:31:56.096
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.

01:31:56.263 --> 01:31:58.265
Christian told me
he's gonna work for her.

01:31:58.432 --> 01:32:01.852
Irv is gonna tell you today. I thought
if I told you, you could fix it.

01:32:02.019 --> 01:32:04.563
- Do I smell freesias?
- What?

01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:07.858
No. I specifically told them...

01:32:08.025 --> 01:32:11.821
If I see freesias anywhere...

01:32:11.987 --> 01:32:14.907
...I will be very disappointed.

01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:19.995
For 72 years, Runway
has been more than a magazine.

01:32:20.162 --> 01:32:23.749
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.

01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:29.213
Miranda Priestly is the finest
possible guardian of that beacon.

01:32:29.755 --> 01:32:34.635
Setting a standard
that inspires people across the globe.

01:32:34.802 --> 01:32:38.681
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miranda Priestly.

01:32:56.407 --> 01:32:58.993
Thank you, my dear friend.

01:33:03.038 --> 01:33:06.208
Thank you very much
for coming today...

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:10.754
...to help celebrate
our dear friend, James Holt.

01:33:18.554 --> 01:33:24.727
But before I talk to you about James
and his many accomplishments...

01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:29.899
...I would like first
to share some news with you.

01:33:32.902 --> 01:33:37.740
As many of you know,
recently Massimo Corteleoni...

01:33:37.907 --> 01:33:41.911
...has agreed to finance
the expansion of the James Holt label.

01:33:42.077 --> 01:33:45.956
Transforming the work
of this visionary artist...

01:33:46.123 --> 01:33:50.586
...into a global brand,
which is really an exciting enterprise.

01:33:51.086 --> 01:33:54.048
Runway and James Holt
share many things in common.

01:33:54.215 --> 01:33:58.969
Chief among them,
a commitment to excellence.

01:33:59.136 --> 01:34:02.556
And so it should come as no surprise...

01:34:02.723 --> 01:34:06.018
...that when the time came
for James to choose the new president...

01:34:06.185 --> 01:34:07.853
...of James Holt International...

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:11.565
...he chose from within
the Runway family.

01:34:12.733 --> 01:34:16.904
And it's my great happiness today
to announce to you all...

01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:21.867
...that that person is my friend...

01:34:22.034 --> 01:34:26.997
...and long-time esteemed colleague,
Jacqueline Follet.

01:34:58.863 --> 01:35:04.577
And now to the main event:
Our celebration of James Holt.

01:35:05.327 --> 01:35:09.039
We at Runway are very proud
to have been among the first to...

01:35:09.206 --> 01:35:12.209
When the time is right
she'll pay me back.

01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:16.964
You sure about that?

01:35:17.131 --> 01:35:18.716
No.

01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:21.844
But I hope for the best.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.763
I have to.

01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:46.994
You thought I didn't know.

01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:52.041
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

01:35:53.125 --> 01:35:57.713
It just took me a little while to find
a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.927
And that James Holt job
was just so absurdly overpaid...

01:36:03.093 --> 01:36:06.013
...that of course she jumped at it.

01:36:06.806 --> 01:36:10.267
So I just had to tell Irv
that Jacqueline was unavailable.

01:36:10.976 --> 01:36:14.855
Truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do.

01:36:15.022 --> 01:36:17.316
Including her.

01:36:17.858 --> 01:36:21.153
Any of the other choices
would have found that job impossible...

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.406
...and the magazine
would have suffered.

01:36:25.449 --> 01:36:27.368
Especially because of the list.

01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:33.874
The list of designers, photographers,
editors, writers, models...

01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:36.418
...all of whom were found by me,
nurtured by me...

01:36:36.585 --> 01:36:39.463
...and have promised me
they will follow me...

01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:42.550
...whenever and if ever
I chose to leave Runway.

01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:46.762
So he reconsidered.

01:36:50.558 --> 01:36:56.856
But I was very, very impressed
by how intently you tried to warn me.

01:36:57.022 --> 01:37:02.486
I never thought I would say this,
Andrea, but I really...

01:37:03.988 --> 01:37:06.073
I see a great deal of myself in you.

01:37:09.618 --> 01:37:13.414
You can see beyond what people want,
and what they need...

01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:17.251
...and you can choose for yourself.

01:37:19.879 --> 01:37:22.923
I don't think I'm like that.

01:37:23.591 --> 01:37:25.342
I...

01:37:28.554 --> 01:37:32.016
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel.
I couldn't do something like that.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.937
You already did.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.735
To Emily.

01:37:43.486 --> 01:37:45.779
That's not what I...

01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:49.283
No, that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:50.993
Oh, no, you chose.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.162
You chose to get ahead.

01:37:54.163 --> 01:37:57.374
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

01:37:57.917 --> 01:38:02.087
But what if this isn't what I want?

01:38:02.671 --> 01:38:05.883
I mean, what if I don't wanna live
the way you live?

01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.720
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.

01:38:11.847 --> 01:38:15.434
Everybody wants to be us.

01:39:41.103 --> 01:39:44.273
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

01:39:45.107 --> 01:39:46.442
What's up?

01:39:47.985 --> 01:39:50.863
Well, I just...

01:39:51.322 --> 01:39:55.326
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.

01:39:55.618 --> 01:39:57.411
That...

01:39:57.578 --> 01:40:00.956
...I turned my back on my friends
and my family...

01:40:01.123 --> 01:40:04.168
...and on everything
I believed in and...

01:40:04.335 --> 01:40:07.755
- And for what?
- For shoes.

01:40:07.922 --> 01:40:10.674
And shirts.
And jackets and belts and...

01:40:10.841 --> 01:40:12.760
Nate...

01:40:16.472 --> 01:40:18.140
...I'm sorry.

01:40:26.148 --> 01:40:28.025
I...

01:40:28.526 --> 01:40:30.736
I flew up to Boston
while you were gone.

01:40:31.779 --> 01:40:33.447
Interviewed at the Oak Room.

01:40:34.657 --> 01:40:35.991
And?

01:40:37.326 --> 01:40:40.079
And you're looking at
their new sous-chef.

01:40:40.246 --> 01:40:43.999
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- Oh, that's great. Congratulations.

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:52.883
Don't know what I'm gonna do without
late-night grilled cheeses, but...

01:40:53.592 --> 01:40:57.096
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

01:40:57.263 --> 01:41:00.266
May even have Jarlsberg.

01:41:02.685 --> 01:41:04.895
We might be able
to figure something out.

01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:08.983
You think?

01:41:09.525 --> 01:41:11.318
Yeah.

01:41:17.616 --> 01:41:21.453
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:24.915
I actually...
I have a job interview today.

01:41:25.082 --> 01:41:26.792
Oh, yeah?

01:41:27.418 --> 01:41:28.752
That's what you're wearing?

01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:32.715
Shut up. I like this.

01:41:36.969 --> 01:41:38.304
Andy. Greg Hill.

01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:39.889
- Hello.
- Come on.

01:41:40.055 --> 01:41:41.390
These clips are excellent.

01:41:41.557 --> 01:41:44.393
This janitors' union thing,
that's exactly what we do here.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.272
My only question is: Runway?

01:41:48.439 --> 01:41:52.234
You were there for less than a year.
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

01:41:53.652 --> 01:41:56.030
Learned a lot.

01:41:57.448 --> 01:42:01.869
In the end, though,
I kind of screwed it up.

01:42:02.036 --> 01:42:06.040
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl...

01:42:06.207 --> 01:42:09.710
...next thing you know, I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...

01:42:09.877 --> 01:42:12.213
...saying of all the assistants
she's ever had...

01:42:12.379 --> 01:42:14.632
...you were by far
her biggest disappointment.

01:42:15.591 --> 01:42:20.930
And if I don't hire you, I am an idiot.

01:42:22.431 --> 01:42:25.059
You must have done something right.

01:42:57.466 --> 01:42:59.009
Miranda Priestly's office.

01:42:59.176 --> 01:43:00.761
Hey, Emily, it's Andy.

01:43:00.928 --> 01:43:02.263
Don 't hang up.

01:43:02.429 --> 01:43:04.348
I have a favor to ask you.

01:43:04.515 --> 01:43:07.184
- You have a favor to ask of me?
- Yeah.

01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:10.396
Thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

01:43:10.563 --> 01:43:13.649
...and I don't have any place
to wear them...

01:43:13.816 --> 01:43:16.861
...so I was wondering
if you could take them off my hands.

01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:22.324
Well, I don't know.

01:43:22.491 --> 01:43:26.704
It's a huge imposition,
and I'll have to get them taken in.

01:43:26.871 --> 01:43:29.540
I mean, they'll drown me.

01:43:29.707 --> 01:43:34.086
But I suppose I could help you out.
I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

01:43:34.253 --> 01:43:36.714
Thanks, Em, I appreciate it.

01:43:37.423 --> 01:43:38.757
Good luck.

01:43:48.851 --> 01:43:51.604
You have some very large shoes to fill.

01:43:52.938 --> 01:43:55.107
Hope you know that.

01:44:00.821 --> 01:44:03.991
I don't understand
why it's so challenging...

01:44:04.158 --> 01:44:08.662
...to get my car when I ask for it.

01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:55.584
Go.
