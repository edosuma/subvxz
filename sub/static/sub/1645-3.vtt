11:16.371 --> 11:17.633
He's a lawyer?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.808
Basically.

11:18.852 --> 11:22.507
That's why you want him
to have the book.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.553
Look, Sofia, the less you know
about this, the safer you'll be.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.598
The less I know,
the less help I'll be.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.730
Exactly.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.427
I just need you
to lay low for a while.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.255
Okay, sweetheart?What the hell is
going on, James?

11:31.299 --> 11:34.041
What is so important
about this book?

11:34.084 --> 11:34.998
Nothing.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.305
It just has notes in it,

11:37.348 --> 11:38.480
you know, phone numbers.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.742
It's people who know people

11:39.786 --> 11:41.657
who are going
to help me get out of here.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.703
You're lying.

11:44.529 --> 11:48.142
Why would I lie to you?

11:48.185 --> 11:51.362
You're the only person
in the world that I can trust.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.149
Come here.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.759
Come here.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.373
Now, I just need you
to trust me.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.679
And do what?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.768
Nothing.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.946
[buzzer sounding]

12:09.990 --> 12:12.253
[indistinct PA announcement]

12:34.492 --> 12:36.843
[overlapping chatter nearby]

12:36.886 --> 12:39.715
You looking for
something, blanquito?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.631
Yeah, yeah,
I am, I am.

12:42.674 --> 12:45.503
What you looking
for then?

12:45.547 --> 12:47.549
Just a little, uh...

12:47.592 --> 12:49.333
little something
to pass the time.

12:49.377 --> 12:52.249
You got paper?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.164
[paper rustling]

12:54.208 --> 12:56.427
Go down to the lost and
found with the rest of them.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.212
They'll hook
you up proper.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.953
All right.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.390
I find you sniffing around
where you don't belong,

13:02.433 --> 13:05.393
you'll find yourself
in that ring again...

13:05.436 --> 13:07.134
against me.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.136
I don't like your odds.

13:14.358 --> 13:18.667
[laughter]

13:27.371 --> 13:29.330

13:57.140 --> 13:58.925
Hello.

13:58.968 --> 14:02.232
LINCOLN:
Want you to check
something out, all right?

14:07.411 --> 14:09.413
LINCOLN:
Look at her left hand-- like
she's pointing at something.

14:32.697 --> 14:36.484
[distant PA announcement]

14:36.527 --> 14:38.442
Well, you'd better
tell my cousin

14:38.486 --> 14:40.357
he'd better make himself
available.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.577
Better him short money
than me short patience.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.320
[phone beeps]

14:46.363 --> 14:47.451
[groans]

14:47.495 --> 14:49.366
I need a charge.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.846
Teodoro,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.021
go on, get me
laundry, no?

14:52.065 --> 14:54.415
Sure thing, boss--
oh, I almost forgot.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.851
Uh, I talked to the barber.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.722
She's gonna squeeze you in
today around 2:00.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.029
If that pleases you,
patrón.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.291
[Lechero chuckling]

15:01.335 --> 15:03.511
Patrón.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.253
[laughs]

15:08.298 --> 15:10.257
[chuckling]

15:11.606 --> 15:12.868
I think it's time you made good

15:12.912 --> 15:14.565
on all the bad you've
done, Theodore.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.524
You and me, we're
going to make a deal.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.874
Lechero has
a cell phone.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.397
I need it.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.703
No problem.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.575
Shall I turn water into
wine while I'm at it?

15:24.619 --> 15:26.447
Maybe give the guy's
mother a good rodgering?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.579
She'd be a little old
for your tastes, no?

15:28.623 --> 15:29.972
Careful, Pretty.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.453
Don't bite the hand you
trying to get fed out of.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.585
I'm not looking for food,
I'm looking for a favor.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.326
Why the hell should
I do you a favor, huh?

15:36.370 --> 15:38.676
'Cause unlike your
new compadres, I
know who you are,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.852
what you've done
and who you've done it to.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.637
Let me get
this straight.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.682
You're saying you
gonna tell on me?

15:44.726 --> 15:48.338
What I'm saying is: this
here is a religious country,

15:48.382 --> 15:50.775
and I'm willing to bet the
good folks down in Panama

15:50.819 --> 15:52.647
don't take too
kindly to rapists

15:52.690 --> 15:55.519
and pedophiles.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.478
You want to bet
against me?

16:17.454 --> 16:18.499
Listen, mate.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.457
Here's what I know so far.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.677
I know you've got a brother
helping on the outside,

16:22.720 --> 16:24.157
I know he ran
into my girlfriend,

16:24.200 --> 16:27.595
and I know he took a book
from her that belongs to me.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.639
I'd like it back.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.511
What's so special
about this book?

16:30.554 --> 16:33.470
Well, unless it has directions
out of this prison,

16:33.514 --> 16:35.516
I don't think it should
really matter to you.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.519
You don't know
what matters to me.

16:38.562 --> 16:41.261
You can get that
book back when we
get out of Sona.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.479
Oh, yeah?

16:42.523 --> 16:43.915
And when the hell is that
exactly?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.047
Because so far
I haven't seen bollocks

16:45.091 --> 16:46.788
in the way
of breaking out of here.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.529
Okay.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.574
Let me tell you
what I know so far.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.837
Some very bad people
who have done

16:52.881 --> 16:54.578
some very bad things
want you alive

16:54.622 --> 16:57.364
and out of this prison,
which is why every bone

16:57.407 --> 16:59.888
in my body is telling
me to do the opposite.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.456
Then why are you doing it?

17:02.499 --> 17:06.373
You're upset because someone
took a book from you.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.636
This is what they took from me.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.116
So let's be clear.

17:10.159 --> 17:14.555
This is what matters
to me, not you

17:14.598 --> 17:17.253
and not your book.

17:18.211 --> 17:21.040
[phone ringing]

17:30.658 --> 17:31.963
Hello.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.617
MAN:
Cousin, how is it?

17:33.661 --> 17:35.663
Hey, Augusto.

17:35.706 --> 17:36.794
You tell me, man.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.232
Oh, business is cyclical,
don dada.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.756
Ebbs and flows,
ebbs and flows, you know.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.410
[chuckles]

17:43.453 --> 17:45.673
Seems like there's more ebbing
than flowing these days, huh?

17:45.716 --> 17:47.196
You think?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.111
I'm gonna tell you
what I think, man.

17:49.155 --> 17:53.028
I think a blackheart is trying
to steal my business.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.595
And...

17:54.638 --> 17:56.597
is taking advantage
of my situation.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.468
If there are mistakes
have been made,

17:58.512 --> 17:59.643
all I need is some honesty, man.

17:59.687 --> 18:02.211
No mistakes, patrón, I swear.

18:02.255 --> 18:06.694
Well, maybe the problem
isn't on the outside.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.043
Maybe the problem is...

18:08.087 --> 18:10.306
[phone beeps, static crackles]

18:10.350 --> 18:11.655
Augusto.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.267

Battery dead.

18:20.664 --> 18:21.665

18:21.709 --> 18:24.233
How me phone
come unplugged? Huh?

18:24.277 --> 18:25.495
My battery dead.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.323
None of you know
nothing, huh?

18:48.649 --> 18:50.694
Mr. Mahone?

18:50.738 --> 18:52.000
Raul Darinda.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.741
I am the public defender
appointed to your case.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.960
That's, uh...

18:56.004 --> 18:58.441
uh, that's great,
that's great.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.616
I-I've been putting together

18:59.660 --> 19:00.835
some notes that I...

19:00.878 --> 19:02.663
Looks like I have
some great news.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.578
We got you a trial date.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.449
[laughs]

19:06.493 --> 19:09.626
That's really... th-thank God.

19:09.670 --> 19:10.540
Thank God-- when?

19:10.584 --> 19:11.759
June 13.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.804
Oh, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, th-the...

19:13.848 --> 19:15.763
13th, 13th, that was last week.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.287
[stammering]:
What, we missed it?

19:18.331 --> 19:21.072
June 13 of next year,
Mr. Mahone.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.553
Next year.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.686
How the hell is that great news?

19:25.729 --> 19:26.948
It usually takes
two and a half years

19:26.991 --> 19:29.255
for a non-citizen to
get before a judge.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.345
I've got a guy in, in here,
his name is Michael Scofield,

19:32.388 --> 19:36.218
and he will testify
that he set me up

19:36.262 --> 19:40.048
and that he put the
drugs on the boat.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.789
Which will all be taken
into consideration...

19:41.832 --> 19:43.530
A year from now!

19:43.573 --> 19:45.662
I'm going to have to ask you
to calm down, Mr. Mahone.[laughs]

19:45.706 --> 19:47.534
It's open
and shut.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.971
It's a no-brainer for you.
I got a guy who can cop to...The notion

19:50.014 --> 19:51.973
of one inmate taking the fall
for another

19:52.016 --> 19:53.801
is not
exactly fresh

19:53.844 --> 19:55.455
and usually means
someone was pressured

19:55.498 --> 19:57.152
into the
confession.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.024
Well, here's the thing, Raul.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.374
I require a
certain medication

20:01.417 --> 20:06.509
that they, well,
they just don't provide here,

20:06.553 --> 20:08.859
and I am...

20:08.903 --> 20:11.732
[laughing]:
Let's just say
that it would be good

20:11.775 --> 20:12.776
for everybody

20:12.820 --> 20:16.693
if, um, if I got
this medication.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.826
Is that a threat?

20:18.869 --> 20:19.914
No.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.699
No, it's a reality,
it's, it's...

20:22.743 --> 20:25.224
It's called Varatril
and, and, and if you...

20:25.267 --> 20:27.008
Look, if you are asking me
to smuggle drugs

20:27.051 --> 20:28.488
into this prison,
then...

20:28.531 --> 20:30.794
No, no, I'm not... I'm not
asking you to smuggle it.

20:30.838 --> 20:31.839
I'm just saying
if you could get...

20:31.882 --> 20:33.057
Good luck, Mr. Mahone.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.839
No, just be a half hour.

for charge.

ain't back

both dead, you hear me?

is not going down alone.

at this number.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.869
All right,
but this Susan chick,

21:45.913 --> 21:47.654
she hasn't even agreed
to it yet, man.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.134
What? I only have 25 minutes

21:50.178 --> 21:51.440
with this phone, Linc.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.833
I'm meeting her right
now, but listen,

21:52.876 --> 21:54.095
Santa Rita ain't
a one-horse town.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.792
I mean, God, I hope
that Sara can give us

21:55.836 --> 21:56.967
some kind of clue
as to where...

21:57.011 --> 21:58.055
Just get her on the line.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.622
Just get her on the line, okay?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.798
This is a one-shot deal.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.322
Yeah, I know, man.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.327
I'm nearly there.

on the wrong foot here.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.733
I'm not a violent guy.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.996
It's just that
I need that shoe.

I can't hardly walk,
and this place--

22:29.435 --> 22:31.524
it changes people.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.013
That's a beautiful name.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.450

some kind of a deal.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.501
I like me men
a little more...

22:52.545 --> 22:53.589
How you say, uh... ?

22:53.633 --> 22:55.417
Not fat.
Fat? This is
all muscle.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
And I'd prove it to you
if I didn't think

22:57.463 --> 23:00.422
you'd take things
south of the border.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.510
Now, hold on.

23:01.554 --> 23:02.859
This is a negotiation.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.861
You don't have to...I no gonna cut you.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.646
I got clients.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.517
Get.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.127
Welcome, patrón.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.955
I'm so honored to have you.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.305
Let's make this quick.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.051
Where the hell
have you been?

23:21.095 --> 23:23.184
Well, a girl's got
to look her best.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.315
This ain't a game, sister.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.100
You'd better back
the hell up.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.536
It's becoming pretty clear
you need us,

23:27.580 --> 23:28.885
so stop pretending
you're in charge,

23:28.929 --> 23:31.322
and give us what we want
when we want it.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.455
Starting with the damn
phone call.

23:42.638 --> 23:43.987
[phone rings]Hello?

23:44.031 --> 23:45.902
SARA:
It's me.

23:45.946 --> 23:46.947
How are you?

23:46.990 --> 23:48.688
I'm tired.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.037
Where...? Where are you?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.821
It's a long story.

23:51.865 --> 23:55.999
As it turns out,
I don't appear to
be going anywhere.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.175
I know. I know.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.482
I'm working on that.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.354
Listen, Sara,
I miss how we used to talk.

24:03.398 --> 24:06.836
Do you remember...
how we used to talk?

24:06.880 --> 24:07.968
Yes.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.665
Oh, good.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.363
Good, because
I saw your picture today,

24:12.407 --> 24:14.322
and I want you to know
I understand...

24:14.365 --> 24:18.195
I understand
the difficult place you're in.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.154
Michael, listen, I...

24:20.197 --> 24:22.504
I don't want you
to think like that.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.549
Why is that?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.159
You have to know

24:25.202 --> 24:28.118
it's a lost cause.

24:28.162 --> 24:31.992
LJ and I--
we can see it now.

24:32.035 --> 24:35.082
It's a lost cause.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.431
Do you understand?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.564
No, no. No, I...
I don't. I don't.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.261
Help me understand.
Help me understand.

24:40.304 --> 24:45.309
All I can think of to help is,
maybe you just need more time?

24:45.353 --> 24:46.441
It's like... It's like

24:46.485 --> 24:48.051
they're giving you
until midnight,

24:48.095 --> 24:50.489
and I'm sitting here
at 3:00 a.m.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.533
[gun cocks]

24:51.577 --> 24:53.230
They're saying
I have to hang up.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.624
Sara, I love you.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.844
I love you, too.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.454
Sara?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.935
Sara?!

25:01.978 --> 25:03.893

25:08.594 --> 25:11.640
MICHAEL:
Linc, they were never
in Santa Rita.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.468
LINCOLN:
What?She said it was a lost cause.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.209
She said she could see
it was a lost cause.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.863
LINCOLN:
So?

25:16.906 --> 25:19.300
The patron saint
of lost causes is Saint Rita.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.041
She was never telling us
where they were.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.956
She was telling us what they
could see from where they were.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.654
He's on his way. We need to get
that phone back, like, rápido.

25:25.698 --> 25:26.568
One more thing, Linc.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.613
Come on, Pretty!Stall them!

25:28.831 --> 25:30.746
She said something
about needing more time.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.532
She said, it's like they were
giving us until midnight,

25:33.575 --> 25:35.490
but she was sitting
at 3:00 a.m.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.057
What the hell does that mean?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.015
I don't know. Maybe they're near
a clock or something.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.103
That's all I got.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.192
Listen, I got to go.

25:42.236 --> 25:44.107
It's up to you.

25:44.151 --> 25:47.067

Lechero!

26:19.142 --> 26:21.797
There's something
you should know.

26:21.841 --> 26:22.929
What?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.076
I think
that barber might have...

26:40.120 --> 26:44.515
Uh... cut me?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.735
Hmm.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.302
No.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.825
No. My mistake.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.435
I...

26:51.479 --> 26:52.915
You know, in fact,
that-that there

26:52.959 --> 26:54.090
might just be
the best shave

26:54.134 --> 26:55.309
I have ever seen.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.659
Boy, you look like
you need one today.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.009
[laughing]:
I might just do that.

27:00.053 --> 27:03.578
Can't be walking around,
looking all, uh, bhuttu.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.972

27:51.452 --> 27:53.933
[clicks phone shut]

27:53.976 --> 27:58.024
Find out everything you can
about this number.

[whistles]

28:01.854 --> 28:02.855
Yo!

28:04.770 --> 28:05.945
Don't move.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.555
I want to know
what the hell you're doing

28:07.598 --> 28:09.862
to James Whistler.I'm doing nothing
to James Whistler.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.386
Listen, we're on the
same team, all right?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.431
Take it easy. Just...

28:14.475 --> 28:16.303
Put the knife away.

28:16.346 --> 28:17.391
Put the knife away.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.698
Put... the knife away.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.397
We're not on the same team.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.790
You want your boy
out of Sona, right?

28:24.833 --> 28:26.356
Right?
Of course.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.098
Well, I'm one of the guys
who's going to break him out.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.534
No.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.188
No. I talked to him
this morning.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.755
He has a lawyer.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.235
I don't know what he's told you,
or who he is.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.540
I know who he is.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.847
Right. A fisherman that
people want out so badly

28:38.891 --> 28:41.241
they're willing to
kidnap my son to get him.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.330
Listen,

28:43.373 --> 28:45.462
you need to talk to him.

28:45.506 --> 28:49.249
You need to
talk to him.

MAN:
Where to, my friend?

28:54.994 --> 28:56.909
I'm looking for a statue,
a monument.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.476
Uh, Saint, Saint Rita.
Says it's in here...

28:59.520 --> 29:01.914
The lady of the lost causes.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.350
Yeah, that's it.The red light district.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.439
You looking
to party?

29:05.482 --> 29:07.310
Yeah.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.234
You all right?

29:18.278 --> 29:20.149
What do you want?

29:20.193 --> 29:22.891
Let you know you don't have
to watch your back.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.285
Make sure I don't have
to watch mine.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.461
My head was a free
ticket out of here.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.767
I don't begrudge anyone

29:28.810 --> 29:31.204
who did what they had
to do to try and get it.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.119
Besides...

29:36.122 --> 29:38.167
...you, uh,

29:38.211 --> 29:40.256
never know when you'll need
a friend in this place.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.432
[chatter in distance]

29:44.434 --> 29:46.262
Where are you from?

29:46.306 --> 29:49.831
Boardman, Ohio.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.964
Kalbarri.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.748
Australia. Good fishing.

29:53.792 --> 29:54.793
You've been?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.882
Passed through.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.971
Small world.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.843
What the hell are
you doing in Panama?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.021
I'm not really in the mood.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.505
You're that cop, aren't you?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.159
You know, I was looking
at that Scofield.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.422
I was trying to figure why he
looked so bloody familiar.

30:15.465 --> 30:16.989
Then, just now,
hearing your voice,

30:17.032 --> 30:19.165
I remember watching the press
when that first happened.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.906
And now you're in here together.

30:20.949 --> 30:23.386
Small world.

30:23.430 --> 30:27.608
You trying to get him out
of here?

30:27.651 --> 30:29.001
Extradition
or, uh...?

30:29.044 --> 30:32.308
I'm not really
in that line of work anymore.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.353
What's he all about?

30:33.396 --> 30:34.441
Scofield.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.443
I mean, is he
dangerous?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.532
[scoffs lightly]

30:38.575 --> 30:40.403
What's it to you?

30:40.447 --> 30:42.579
Just curious...

30:42.623 --> 30:45.495
as to what kind of chap
I'm dealing with.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.370
I guess that depends on why
you'd be dealing with him.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.852
Like I said...
you never know when you'll...

30:53.895 --> 30:56.419
Need a friend.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.420
Yeah.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.466
See, one thing about Scofield

30:59.509 --> 31:00.902
is that, for those

31:00.946 --> 31:03.557
that he cares about,
he'll do just about anything.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.647
But he'll screw you three ways
to Sunday if he doesn't.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.432
I can guess which side
you ended up on.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.916
Well...

31:17.440 --> 31:19.399
Thanks for the chat.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.488
You know, I really
just came by...

31:21.531 --> 31:22.750
No, you came by
'cause you wanted

31:22.793 --> 31:24.360
to find out more about Scofield,

31:24.404 --> 31:25.622
but that's cool.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.755
We're squared away.

There. She is there.

Saint Rita in this town?

32:06.533 --> 32:08.361

No. No comprendo.

It was the right place.

get to it in time.

Did they look all right?

As far as I could tell, yeah.

You can keep that.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.086
Keep it as a souvenir

can do this.

possible to get out.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.715
Well, unless this Sofia
is being held at gunpoint,

35:08.758 --> 35:10.717
we got nothing in common.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.327
But maybe you can
start by telling me

35:12.371 --> 35:14.112
why the Company's
so interested in you.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.504
What company?

35:18.812 --> 35:21.031
I don't have time
for games.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.471
Okay, okay, look.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.474
Look, I've been splitting
time between here

35:28.517 --> 35:30.824
and the Pacific Northwest
running charters.
Fishing?

35:30.867 --> 35:33.696
Fishing, sightseeing-- whatever
was paying the bloody rent.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.482
Now, about a year ago,
I took a guy out.

35:36.525 --> 35:37.526
He was some sort of naturalist.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.006
He was, uh...
he was taking

35:39.049 --> 35:40.312
water samples,
measurements.
What for?

35:40.355 --> 35:43.184
I don't know.
I didn't really care as long

35:43.228 --> 35:44.664
as the check cleared,
but here's the thing.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.318
A few months later,
I get a call from somebody

35:46.361 --> 35:48.189
wanting to know
where I took the guy.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.496
And I told them
I couldn't remember.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.586
But then these, um...

35:53.629 --> 35:55.370
then these
government types,

35:55.414 --> 35:57.590
they started showing up at
my flat asking questions,

35:57.633 --> 35:59.635
and I didn't know what to do.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.203
So I got low,
I came down to Panama,

36:02.247 --> 36:03.813
and I moved in
with Sofia full time.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.120
Until...Until the fight at the bar.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.427
Yeah, and then
I end up here,

36:08.470 --> 36:10.646
where those same people
show up at visitation

36:10.690 --> 36:12.213
saying they're
going to get me out.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.781
And when they do,
I'm to take them
to the same place

36:14.824 --> 36:16.217
that I took that guy.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.697
That's why I need
the book your brother copped.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.481
It's my trip log.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.353
I write notes
in the margins-- you know,
coordinates, landmarks.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.355
I need to retrace my steps
and find that location.

36:23.398 --> 36:26.227
I don't have a choice.That's a really
interesting story,

36:26.271 --> 36:28.186
but if that book's as valuable
as you say it is,

36:28.229 --> 36:30.231
maybe I should hold onto it
for a little while,

36:30.275 --> 36:31.885
make sure they hold up
their end of the deal.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.365
You don't get this, do you?

36:33.408 --> 36:35.018
I need time to be able...

36:35.062 --> 36:38.500
The only thing I'm responsible
for is getting you out of here.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.590

is between you and them.

36:41.634 --> 36:42.765

38:24.302 --> 38:26.521
Okay.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.308
I was walking earlier,

Now, I couldn't
tell who it was,

38:38.228 --> 38:40.622

corner, I recognized the faces--
