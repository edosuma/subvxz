Hi, Mickey.

00:05.291 --> 00:07.915
Can I borrow a stick of butter? Please?

00:09.041 --> 00:11.416
You know me.
I can't say... nnnn...

00:12.333 --> 00:13.333
Nnnn...

00:15.957 --> 00:18.041
About that butter?
Right.

00:22.291 --> 00:23.666
Bye, Mickey!

00:23.666 --> 00:24.790
Ugh.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.457
Ding-dong!

00:27.416 --> 00:30.499
Say, Mick, I was wondering if
I could borrow this here chair.

00:30.499 --> 00:32.499
My chair?
What for, goof?

00:32.874 --> 00:34.416
Charity.

00:34.666 --> 00:36.832
Well, gee, goofy, I...
Aw, thanks, Mick!

00:36.832 --> 00:39.291
I knew you was the charitable type.

00:42.416 --> 00:45.083
You know me.
I can't say... nnnn...

00:46.915 --> 00:48.832
Then you won't mind if I borrow your car?

00:49.790 --> 00:50.915
My car?

00:52.499 --> 00:54.499
Well, it wouldn't be much of
a charity drive without a car,

00:54.499 --> 00:56.000
now would it?

01:00.416 --> 01:02.291
Can I borrow $5?

01:02.291 --> 01:03.957
Nnnn... oh, my!

01:04.249 --> 01:05.624
Mind if I borrow your girl?

01:05.874 --> 01:06.957
Nnnn... nnnn... nnnn...

01:08.624 --> 01:10.166
Do you mind?

01:11.208 --> 01:13.333
Can we borrow some toilet paper?

01:15.624 --> 01:17.124
Your dog?

01:17.499 --> 01:18.874
Meow meow?

01:18.874 --> 01:19.957
Your house?

01:23.749 --> 01:25.790
Doh, you know me...

01:25.790 --> 01:28.291
You can't say no!

01:31.749 --> 01:34.166
Hey, Mickey.
Why the long face?

01:34.166 --> 01:36.249
I can't say, nnnn...

01:36.249 --> 01:37.374
Nnnn... nnnn...

01:37.874 --> 01:38.957
Nevermind.

01:40.291 --> 01:42.249
You never could say no!

01:43.291 --> 01:44.624
Donald, that's it.

01:44.624 --> 01:47.374
You're going to teach me
how to say... nnnn...

01:50.333 --> 01:52.000
No, I'm not.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.666
Exactly.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.208
If you insist.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.249
Nnn! Oh!

01:57.249 --> 01:58.249
Nnn! Oh!

01:59.249 --> 02:00.915
No! No!

02:01.416 --> 02:02.416
No!

02:02.915 --> 02:03.915
No?

02:04.832 --> 02:06.457
Donald, you did it.

02:06.457 --> 02:08.124
You can thank me later.

02:08.124 --> 02:09.749
No!

02:09.749 --> 02:11.832
I don't know what came over me.

02:11.832 --> 02:15.000
Excuse me, can you tell me
where I might find main street?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.832
Why of course, just
follow this street and...

02:16.832 --> 02:17.915
No!
Well!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.333
Help an old woman cross the street?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.749
My pleasure. No!

02:26.457 --> 02:27.499
No!

02:28.291 --> 02:29.499
Pull over.

02:29.499 --> 02:30.582
No!

02:30.957 --> 02:32.374
Swear to tell the truth.

02:32.374 --> 02:33.541
No!

02:34.166 --> 02:36.707
Do these horizontal stripes
make my butt look big?

02:37.041 --> 02:38.333
No!

02:47.749 --> 02:50.166
No, no, no.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.499
What?

02:54.291 --> 02:55.749
Returnin' the favor.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.000
Meow.

03:05.957 --> 03:07.582
Five, plus interest.

03:07.915 --> 03:09.291
You can keep her.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.624
Honk, honk!

03:14.915 --> 03:16.749
I thought I would return the flavor.

03:18.624 --> 03:21.291
Ha, I guess it pays to be
a nice guy after all.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.291
Ahem.

03:22.707 --> 03:24.499
Mind if we join you?

03:24.749 --> 03:26.832
As a matter of fact, yes!

03:27.249 --> 03:28.416
I do mind.
