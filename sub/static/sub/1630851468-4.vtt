00:12.960 --> 00:15.960
<i>In every family,</i>
<i>people have their role.</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:19.400
I guess there's no one here!

00:21.760 --> 00:24.720
<i>Mine was the fun one,</i>
<i>the goofball.</i>

00:24.760 --> 00:26.200
No! Ha-ha!

00:26.240 --> 00:28.640
<i>The lovable screw-up</i>
<i>in the family</i>

00:28.680 --> 00:30.280
<i>who, mostly, had it together.</i>

00:30.320 --> 00:32.720
My notes, Ben!

00:32.760 --> 00:33.960
Her notes, Ben!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.280
Yes, Ben!

00:35.320 --> 00:36.640
I'm sorry!

00:36.680 --> 00:37.920
That's it!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.240
No! No! No!

00:41.280 --> 00:43.640
Argh! Don't! Ha!

00:43.680 --> 00:46.800
Surrender your weapon, sir.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.240
<i>Now look at us.</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:51.080
<i>Me aside,</i>
<i>the Rafters are a mess.</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
<i>Mum and Dad</i>

00:52.160 --> 00:55.280
<i>gone from joined at the hip</i>
<i>to daily calls.</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:57.000
Nathan OK?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.640
About to take him biking.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.360
Good.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.800
I was thinking Rachel
should be home by about now.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.880
Uh, yeah.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.760
<i>Rachel tied to her desk,</i>

01:09.800 --> 01:12.440
<i>soon to factor in</i>
<i>being a single mum.</i>

01:12.480 --> 01:15.200
<i>And poor old Nath.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:18.000
<i>Single dad twice-divorced,</i>
<i>building screwed,</i>

01:18.040 --> 01:20.920
<i>and barely holding down</i>
<i>a part-time job.</i>

01:35.760 --> 01:37.920
- Want to go again?
- Come on!

01:37.960 --> 01:40.320
You do know, Dad, you've
got your very own Carbo here.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.280
You reckon? Not quite.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.920
I'm good. I'm good here. You go.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.920
OK. Won't be long.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.200
<i>Suddenly,</i>
<i>I'm the functional one.</i>

02:06.240 --> 02:07.880
<i>Can't take all the credit.</i>

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
The kids would love
a bag of red frogs.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.840
And some red cordial
to wash them down?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.680
And then a ladder
to get them off the ceiling.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.680
<i>Mum always said</i>
<i>'You'll know when you know.'</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:19.160
<i>And I did.</i>

02:23.720 --> 02:25.160
Hello.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.160
My future just a wall away.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.320
This is a bit weird.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.920
Thank God you swiped right.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.840
Would you like a drink?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.120
Yes.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.600
<i>I stretched out my break</i>

02:59.640 --> 03:01.720
<i>until Donna</i>
<i>threatened to fire me.</i>

03:01.760 --> 03:05.360
<i>I still can't believe she swiped</i>
<i>right, let alone married me.</i>

03:05.400 --> 03:07.800
Welcome home, Mrs. Rafter.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.640
Ooh! I like that.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.080
<i>And maybe that's why,</i>
<i>just like that,</i>

03:12.120 --> 03:14.520
<i>the goofball was gone.</i>

03:14.560 --> 03:19.480
<i>Now I was son,</i>
<i>brother, uncle, husband.</i>

03:19.520 --> 03:23.400
<i>And as for father?</i>
<i>Work in progress.</i>

03:23.440 --> 03:25.040
Babe?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.600
Hm.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.840
I really don't think
we should take it.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.640
Hm?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.400
Rachel's money.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.200
That's good. It's all good.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.440
I don't feel comfortable
taking money from her.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.520
Sweetheart, Rach doesn't do
anything she doesn't want to.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.600
I get that, but I'm saying
I don't want to take it.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.280
It'll put us
way ahead of the game.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.720
Soon as you're back on deck...

04:00.440 --> 04:03.080
<i>We work because we talk,</i>

04:03.120 --> 04:05.280
<i>like Mum and Dad used to.</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:09.240
<i>Ben Rafter -</i>
<i>never thought I'd say it -</i>

04:09.280 --> 04:12.080
<i>the most together one</i>
<i>in the family.</i>

04:40.880 --> 04:42.240
You don't think you're obsessed?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.760
What else are weekends for?

04:44.760 --> 04:45.920
Fair enough.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.200
One here for you.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.040
Uh...

04:53.760 --> 04:54.800
It's a good place here.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.560
Tell that to your mum for me.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.600
I just want you to know

05:02.640 --> 05:04.800
that I haven't come up
here to avoid responsibility.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.600
I know you think that I was
reckless for chucking in my job.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.360
Just worried.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.520
But if I hadn't, I would've
snapped or had a breakdown.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.600
I don't know. I was no good
to Eddie the way that I was.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.360
My thinking was to come here
and get my strength back.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.560
For him.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.040
You're in the right spot.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.920
Seems like it. Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.880
- Here he is!
- You ready to shred it?

05:29.920 --> 05:31.360
I was thinking we
should take Nath

05:31.360 --> 05:32.720
up around Patterson's track.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.720
You know,
the one I told you about.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.720
Yeah...

05:34.760 --> 05:35.920
I don't think
you have much choice.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.480
Well done.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.680
Know a senator dragging

06:59.720 --> 07:01.160
the chain on climate policy?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.320
What do you give them,

07:02.360 --> 07:03.680
other than a lump of coal?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.880
- Stress poo!

07:04.920 --> 07:07.480
- And flush 'em down the loo.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
Stress poos?

07:10.080 --> 07:11.360
This OK with Observation Earth?

07:11.400 --> 07:14.560
Save the planet with
a biodegradable stress poo.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.560
Uh, it's a bit more
than I expected,

07:17.600 --> 07:19.000
but...
...I'm sure it's fine.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.960
Mm. I guess.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.400
Hey, if having us all
at your place gets too much,

07:26.440 --> 07:28.440
please just say -
Donna has offered us a room.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.160
I will, but it's fine -
honestly.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.960
Come on through
and get one today.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.160
Hey, buddy,
you're looking stressed.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.360
Why don't you give your
stress poo a hefty press? Whoo!

07:38.400 --> 07:40.000
Listen, I might slip away
and see Dad.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
Are you right to take
Edward home?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.680
Yeah. Of course.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.920
If both those kids
get carried away

07:44.960 --> 07:46.360
you can always get Ben
to calm them down.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.960
Yeah, OK.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.320
Hello?

07:50.360 --> 07:52.240
Take that, Chuck.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.000
Don't poo-poo
the stress poo!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.360
Justin? American Justin?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.840
How can I help you, mate?

07:58.880 --> 08:00.720
Do you understand
what 'bad optics' means?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.480
Um...

08:02.520 --> 08:03.760
It means
'Shut down the live stream.'

08:04.400 --> 08:07.280
You're hawking
plastic landfill, man.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.240
I'm pretty sure
they're biodegradable.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.160
Just be glad it's not me
and not Rachel on this call.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.640
But they're really into it!

08:12.680 --> 08:14.000
I'm at Observation Earth

08:14.040 --> 08:15.920
about to negotiate on behalf
of your family and your sister.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.280
And if they're watching
this train wreck, they'll...

08:18.320 --> 08:19.560
Just shut it the hell down. Now!

08:19.600 --> 08:22.280
Copy that. Sorry.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.520
Hey, buddy, under duress?

08:23.560 --> 08:24.520
Here, give your stress poo

08:24.560 --> 08:25.520
a hefty press, hey!

08:28.160 --> 08:30.200
Cut it. Cut it! Cut it. Charles!

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
We should go
to that café more often.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.280
It was great to get out,
wasn't it?

08:43.320 --> 08:45.000
Hm.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.040
Oh, no, Dad, maybe leave
them on for now.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.640
Why don't we go to the lounge
room for a cup of tea?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.760
I've got time before work.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.720
Since when did you work?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.760
Well, I'm just filling
in for Nathan

09:09.840 --> 09:11.480
at the Boat Club, remember?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
With Donna.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.720
You know Donna?

09:16.760 --> 09:18.600
That new Indian Sheila, is it?

09:19.520 --> 09:21.520
Smells a bit funny,
if you ask me.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.840
No, Dad. That's...
That's your nurse. Rhea.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.520
She wears patchouli oil
and she's lovely.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
I didn't say she wasn't.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.320
Aren't we going
to some fancy café?

09:39.480 --> 09:40.840
Maybe another day.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.000
Good. I'm buggered.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.320
Mrs. Rafter?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.160
Hard morning with Dad?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.720
Yeah.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.880
I've got five minutes.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.120
I'm not saying
I expected a miracle,

10:21.160 --> 10:24.160
But I did think more time with
him would make a difference.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.640
For who?

10:25.640 --> 10:28.080
Well, him, obviously.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.400
No, I know he won't get better.
I understand that.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.240
I moved closer
to see him more often.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.760
I've said before

10:34.760 --> 10:38.840
that more time isn't
guaranteed quality time for him.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.720
It may be for you
and wonderful if so

10:41.760 --> 10:44.400
but if it makes you distressed...

10:46.640 --> 10:49.240
Ted lives in fragments -

10:49.280 --> 10:53.160
a fractured mosaic
remembered in parts, if at all.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.840
So the only person more frequent
visits might help is you.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.120
The question is
are they helping?

11:01.160 --> 11:05.160
Well, um, I'm out here
and not in there, so...

11:05.200 --> 11:10.840
And if Ted were well
and saw this, what would he say?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.800
He wouldn't like
to see me upset.

11:16.040 --> 11:20.920
Ted gets a lot more from his
family than most around here.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.360
It's not my place to give
advice, Mrs. Rafter,

11:25.400 --> 11:27.480
but from my experience
over the years,

11:27.520 --> 11:30.880
don't shape your life
around him.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.680
Thanks.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.960
I hope she's not too bummed.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.960
You're not too bummed

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
that we had to stop
the streaming, are ya?

11:45.040 --> 11:46.840
All protest artists
get shut down.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.280
Or it's not a real protest.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.760
Where did you read that?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.160
- Charles said.
- Oh.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
Charles knows.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.680
Can I keep my poo?

11:53.720 --> 11:55.120
Yeah.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.320
Hey, Benno, can you
just give me a hand?

11:57.360 --> 11:59.640
I left something
back at the...stall.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.720
Uh, yeah.
I'll catch you at the car.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.440
- So, I had a brainwave.
- Yeah?

12:06.480 --> 12:08.280
OK, so, um, before you guys,

12:08.320 --> 12:10.480
you know, have another
go with the baby,

12:10.520 --> 12:13.160
Retta and I reckon you
guys need some chill time.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.440
So you're coming
with us to Lesbos!

12:15.480 --> 12:16.720
Wait, what?

12:16.760 --> 12:19.360
Lesbos? The island.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.320
Greece! Hey?

12:21.360 --> 12:23.840
When we go back, you can come
with us, help us break it in.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.160
Mate, we can't afford it.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.640
Yeah, well, I can.
I'm raking it in.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.680
And, well, Retta reckons Cassie
seems a bit stressed lately.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.720
Yeah, that was before
we got Rachel's money.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.320
What, you didn't
reckon so today?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.640
- You reckon?
- Trust Retta.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.600
She knows these things.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.520
So what do you say?
Are you gonna do it?

12:44.560 --> 12:48.440
Just say yes, mate! Come on.
Greece. Just say it. Yes.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.600
'Yes, Carbo. Yes.'

12:50.640 --> 12:52.800
What do you reckon?
Hit the quarry next time?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.000
Kick it up a few notches?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.800
Hey, you were pretty good out
there. What do you say?

12:55.840 --> 12:58.400
I'd say you've got a visitor.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.560
- W-we'll clean the bikes.
- Yeah, whatevs.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.200
Mrs. Spade. This is a surprise.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.480
Really? I thought you
might've expected me.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.320
And may I say,
before you demonise me,

13:14.360 --> 13:16.920
Ruby's convictions
are one thing

13:16.960 --> 13:19.960
but denigrating the school on
social media quite another.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.520
We think you do
a great job, Mrs. Spade,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.200
it was just this
one misunderstanding.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.440
I have a request of you.
A local reporter

13:26.480 --> 13:29.520
wants to do a piece
on this matter for syndication.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.800
I was hoping you
might speak to him.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.640
To say what?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.000
Set the record straight.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.840
Just explain that you understand

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
our decision
about Ruby's artwork.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.280
There are two sides
to this thing, of course.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.120
And this whole thing has gotten
wildly out of hand.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.760
A ludicrous explosion
of worldwide attention.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.800
No argument there but I'm
not badmouthing my daughter.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.720
I'm not asking you to.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.000
Simply say you understand
why we did what we did.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.440
Well, all I know is that Rubes
put some poo on a painting

13:57.480 --> 13:58.920
and now she's being made out

13:58.960 --> 14:01.040
to be the next Greta
what's-her-name.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.400
That's precisely the online
world at its very worst.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.920
She's the hero,
we're the demons.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.160
The whole school suffers!

14:06.200 --> 14:07.400
It will blow over.

14:07.440 --> 14:11.160
Friction between the parents,
quite violent exchanges.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.240
I haven't heard any of that.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.680
Our lovely little town has
become an international joke!

14:16.720 --> 14:18.680
Right.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.760
Alright.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.200
He wants to go
to print tomorrow so...

14:27.720 --> 14:30.280
..the sooner you phone him,
the better.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.800
Yep.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.080
Hi, this is Julie Rafter.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.760
Please leave
a message after the beep.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.360
Oh! So that's what you
were doing with Carbo?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.960
Agreeing that we'd go
on a month's holiday.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.840
- Ben, you really should...
- I know what you're gonna say.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.560
But this isn't gonna cost us.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.200
Don't think of it as a holiday.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.880
What else would it be?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.120
For a whole month?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.680
Do I just drop the contracts
that I'm helping with

15:03.720 --> 15:05.560
just after we've taken
money from Rachel?

15:05.600 --> 15:08.960
Money to help us have a baby!
And this will be helping too.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.360
I know it's been stressful,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.800
and I know because
of your whole family thing

15:12.840 --> 15:15.400
it makes it hard for
you to accept gifts, but...

15:15.440 --> 15:18.200
It's not my family thing. It's
got nothing to do with gifts.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.680
It's because,
you know, you never...

15:19.720 --> 15:21.440
Carbo is coming from a...

15:21.480 --> 15:22.840
Sorry, go ahead.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.640
I interrupted. I'm sorry.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.800
I couldn't speak.
Literally could not speak.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.040
Ben gave me an opening

15:31.080 --> 15:34.440
and it's like my mind
just went blank - I froze.

15:34.480 --> 15:39.200
- OK.
- It wasn't logical. It was...

15:39.240 --> 15:40.480
It was what?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.760
It was like I was back with...

15:42.800 --> 15:44.280
With my first husband,

15:44.320 --> 15:48.040
if I tried to stand up to him
about the slightest thing...

15:48.800 --> 15:50.520
Go on.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.080
Well, I finally did stand up
to him and look what happened.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.040
He kicked you out.

15:57.240 --> 16:01.720
Alright. What I'm going to say
comes from love.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.560
Do you actually
want to overcome this?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.600
To tell Ben that
that's it for IVF?

16:06.640 --> 16:10.840
Or do you want to keep talking
about it and talking about it

16:10.880 --> 16:13.280
and hope that it
just fades away?

16:15.760 --> 16:18.080
Have you ever been
to a counselor?

16:18.120 --> 16:19.520
No.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.400
Could you get Ben to go with you
to see someone?

16:21.440 --> 16:22.720
It's me. Not him.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.120
It's a relationship, Cass.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.280
I think I have someone
I can recommend.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.000
A few couples I know
have been a bit rocky lately.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.960
Hm. Could the common
factor be me?

16:43.400 --> 16:47.320
I guess I had this romantic idea
that I'd help, somehow.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.800
It was one bad day.
Of course you're helping.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.920
Am I, though? Who?

16:51.960 --> 16:56.960
Dad's possibly worse. Ben and
Cassie seem to be coping.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.560
Nathan and Edward
aren't out on the streets

16:59.600 --> 17:02.640
and Rachel's...
she's flown in and flown out.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.120
Where's Dave in all this?

17:04.680 --> 17:06.400
We call.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.840
Do you know Ben even tried

17:08.880 --> 17:11.080
to give me marriage advice
yesterday?

17:11.080 --> 17:13.960
Which seems to be his new role -
the family glue.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.280
He's a good man.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.160
I moved to help them,
not the other way around.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.640
And I miss Dave.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.240
Then go back.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.440
Not without answers.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.880
I thought it was about family.
If it wasn't...

17:27.920 --> 17:29.800
Then what?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.640
The million-dollar question.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.480
Hey, have you got a minute?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.480
Yeah, sure, sweetheart.
What do you need?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.720
Actually, I was looking for
Donna. Have you got a sec?

17:38.760 --> 17:40.560
I rest my case.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.280
A month? And would you
like fries with that?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.200
I know it's a lot,
but hear my plan.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.560
I train up Nathan
and with Mum behind the bar

17:52.640 --> 17:54.880
and him doing my job,
I'm covered!

17:54.920 --> 17:56.960
You do remember
he just absented himself

17:57.000 --> 17:58.440
with no guarantee of return.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.960
He'll be back - in a few days,
he'll get bored. And he's skint.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.880
Just a heads-up...

18:03.920 --> 18:06.800
as much as I also would
love a holiday in Greece,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.800
you have to pay me in
solid gold to go with Carbo.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.200
Every moment of tranquillity
will be live-streamed.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.280
You'll plunge into that
turquoise Mediterranean Sea

18:16.320 --> 18:18.720
and he'll be down there
with his camera.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.000
Talking underwater.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.200
Cassie will lay down the law.
So is that a yes?

18:26.440 --> 18:29.680
Go on. Go look after your wife.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.160
She's lucky to have you.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.480
I reckon too.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.240
Thank you.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.720
Hey.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.440
Thanks again for chatting,
Mr. Rafter. I'll keep it quick.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.560
Alright, look, before we start,

19:02.560 --> 19:06.000
I think that Ruby's commitment
on climate is brilliant.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.240
But all this fuss over her
is a huge load of crap

19:09.280 --> 19:11.800
about a...well,
a little bit of crap.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.640
It's all just crap.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.040
Well, it's good
that you can laugh about it.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.800
Yeah. Too crazy
to take seriously.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.000
Oh! Don't know how you do it.
Looks like a hard slog.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.320
I guess I enjoy the challenge.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.400
There's always
a new carrot dangling.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.480
Today, Masters.
One day, maybe a PhD.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.680
Ooh! And your eyes just glowed.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.520
It's just tiring. And being
broke gets very old.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.560
You'll look back on it one day
and smile, I'm sure.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.200
You never went to uni?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.560
There was a saying...

19:51.560 --> 19:53.040
'A piece of paper
won't get you a husband.'

19:53.080 --> 19:54.640
No.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.960
- Ah. Different times.
- Ugh.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.960
'Typing, shorthand and home
economics is all a girl needs.'

20:00.000 --> 20:01.200
So said Mum, bless her.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.040
I do envy your generation.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.320
- Anyway, thanks for today.
- Oh, no worries.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.800
All that selling poo?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.560
And paintings.
I think I might leave school.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.760
I wouldn't be saying
that around Mum.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.480
Why? I only go to school
to become an artist.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.760
I already am one.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.000
One good day, Rubes.
You're not Banksy.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.720
He's a street artist.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.240
As if I don't know that.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.320
Even you knew that.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.400
I was talking to Edward.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.920
Getting a bit full of yourself.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.240
A good artist knows their worth.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.320
Let me guess - Charles?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.560
- He's lived.
- And you haven't yet.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.080
So if you want to put the
kibosh on the whole thing,

20:46.160 --> 20:47.560
tell Mum you're leaving school.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.280
I will too.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.480
See? You're a bad influence.
Now, tidy this all up.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.480
I don't want Cassie
coming home to a pigsty.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.240
Fine.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.760
And I won't have time for school
and Observation Earth.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.560
Just saying.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.960
Sorry. I had to make a decision.
I did call.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.320
I was working.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.800
And the reporter only had today
so I took care of it.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.040
What reporter? Was it about me?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.000
Uh, yes. Right, Dave?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
Then why didn't
they interview me?

21:19.080 --> 21:20.680
Good question. It is her art.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.800
It was about other stuff.
Adult stuff.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.520
How was your day, Rubes?
Market go well?

21:25.560 --> 21:28.160
- I made $350.
- Wait... What?!

21:28.200 --> 21:29.760
- Today?
- Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.320
Mostly from my paintings,
but some from the poo.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.920
And Carbo's
coming over tomorrow

21:34.960 --> 21:36.400
to film me making
a new piece.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.720
- And what's this one about?
- The prime minister.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.960
- Oh!
- It's called Heart of Coal.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.280
Carbo thinks it
could get us on the news.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.800
OK, well, let's talk about
that after dinner, shall we?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.320
Let me say good night
to your dad.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.320
OK. Bye, Dad. I miss you.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.160
You too, Rubes. Be good.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.880
And thanks for saying good
things to the reporter.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.640
Did you?

21:56.680 --> 21:59.160
First, where you want to start?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.640
The fact that she's about to
piss off the prime minister

22:01.680 --> 22:03.760
or she makes more money in
a day than both of us?

22:03.800 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, well, I'm starting to see
your point.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.960
I just don't like this to get
bigger than her. She's a kid.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.800
It's already changing her.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.640
Is that what you
said to the reporter?

22:11.680 --> 22:13.440
In so many words.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.760
He seemed pretty impressed,
actually.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.400
OK, well, I should get off.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.240
It's my turn for dinner.

22:20.280 --> 22:24.280
- OK. Love you.
- You too.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.520
'Night.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.440
'Night.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.400
Oi. Mind if I join?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.440
No kombucha tonight?

22:39.480 --> 22:41.000
It's hard to find in Buradeena.

22:43.520 --> 22:46.000
Besides, it's the first time
in a while I've felt like a beer

22:46.040 --> 22:47.880
and not been worried
I'd want three more.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.840
The last few days have felt like
a wheel alignment.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.880
Good.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.760
Good you're feeling a bit more
on top of things.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.000
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.480
Well, you know I'm here for you.
I'm your dad.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.160
It's funny, watching you
and Paddo

23:13.200 --> 23:14.720
made me realise something.

23:15.720 --> 23:21.360
It's not a dad I need right now.
I... I need a mate.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.920
Well, a mate it is.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.240
Cassie? Are you still up?

24:02.640 --> 24:05.960
Babe? About Greece.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.680
It isn't about the money.
Well, it's not just that.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.200
Ben?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.720
Ben?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.600
How could you
be so stupid?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.200
I was just
trying to hose it down.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.000
What, by calling your
daughter's artwork crap?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.080
That's not what I said.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.680
'It's just a big load of crap
about crap.' End quote.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.360
Who said that?

24:53.400 --> 24:55.360
No one, darling.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.440
Is that Ruby?

24:56.480 --> 24:57.760
Don't go online.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.560
Ruby? Look, it was just a joke
that I said to a journalist.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.040
He made
it sound like I was serious.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.960
It's a bit early for art,
isn't it?

25:05.000 --> 25:08.040
That's what Retta said.
But Rubes calls the shots.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.440
A bit too much these days,
I reckon.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.040
Why does that look like blood?

25:12.080 --> 25:15.800
She wants to up the impact. You
know, go big or go home, right?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.400
Hey, Justin really doesn't want
that live stream thing.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.800
Mate, the fans will flip out
if I don't.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.920
OK. Who's ready
to get carbonated?

25:23.960 --> 25:26.720
You said that to a journalist?

25:26.760 --> 25:29.080
Dave, stop speaking. Ruby,
it is not as bad as it sounds.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.960
I'm trying to save the world
and my dad thinks it's crap!

25:32.000 --> 25:34.880
Here she is,
what do you say, Rubes?

25:34.920 --> 25:36.400
Ready to stick it to the PM?

25:36.440 --> 25:38.000
Is that Carbo? Is he filming?

25:38.040 --> 25:40.240
- You called it crap.
- I didn't mean it!

25:40.280 --> 25:42.520
My dad thinks I'm a joke.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.880
Carbo, turn the camera off!

25:48.720 --> 25:49.760
- Oof!
- What?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.880
- Comments.
- They're commenting?

25:51.920 --> 25:52.880
Mm.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.000
Don't people have
better things to do?

25:54.040 --> 25:55.200
Nah. They don't seem to.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.800
What are they saying?
Actually, no, don't tell me.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.400
Well, she's officially
gone viral again.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.000
So, isn't this what you want?

26:03.040 --> 26:05.160
Not if the whole world
is laughing at her

26:05.200 --> 26:06.160
and it's my fault!

26:06.200 --> 26:07.640
This is exactly what I didn't
want to happen.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.040
Can't we shut it down?

26:15.760 --> 26:18.080
You gonna answer that?

26:23.720 --> 26:25.000
Mm-mmm.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.400
Hello.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.920
Dad, why didn't you call me
first? Or Justin.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.800
Buradeena's taking
a bit of a walloping, Rachel.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
The whole thing is
in danger of falling apart.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.120
This isn't what Ruby wants.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.760
Look, in
the scheme of things...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.520
In the scheme of things,
this is a nine-year-old girl

26:42.560 --> 26:44.520
who is being offered
an amazing opportunity

26:44.560 --> 26:46.040
that may never
come her way again

26:46.080 --> 26:47.720
which is always, always
depended

26:47.760 --> 26:49.680
on her parents presenting
a united front

26:49.720 --> 26:50.960
and being supportive.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.680
Not one parent completely
undermining her.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.280
Let's just calm it
down a little bit.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.320
Good luck, Justin,
spinning 'rogue father'.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.760
I'm not rogue and
I don't want to be spun.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.680
Speak to no one, do not answer
any calls, except from me.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.200
I'll phone in a few hours.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.640
Given how civil this one's been,
I can't wait for the follow-up.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.280
Margaret Thatcher,
eat your heart out.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.040
Who?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.800
I need to
see Dad before work

27:15.840 --> 27:17.400
but I'm not sure
I should leave her.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.760
Can't Donna get
someone to cover?

27:18.800 --> 27:21.680
She'll be fine. I've already got
a plan to cheer her up.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.080
The healing nature of art.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.600
You never cease to surprise.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.840
Ben Rafter - art-lover, fixer.
Who knew?

27:29.880 --> 27:32.280
To think I came down
here to help.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.240
You know, I keep
thinking about Greece.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.040
It's going
to wonderful for Cassie.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.960
We'll need someone
to carry our bags.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.240
Oh, what, your mother trailing
along the cobblestones?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.840
I don't think so.
Thanks, sweetheart.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.720
Bye.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.200
What am I doing?

27:57.240 --> 28:01.120
Dave's right. The kids don't
need me micromanaging them.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.080
Even if I do call it helping.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.720
This feeling isn't going away.

28:11.080 --> 28:16.000
Which means it isn't about
the kids or you at all.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.000
Donna asked me,
'Well, then what?'

28:26.040 --> 28:28.480
Then what?

28:30.560 --> 28:33.040
This is the fourth message
I've left for you, Ryan.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.080
You misquoted me.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.280
And on behalf of my daughter,
I demand an apology.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.440
And have the guts
to answer your bloody phone.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.200
Please tell me your solution
isn't buying drugs.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.720
Not yet.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.520
What if someone recognises me?

29:07.560 --> 29:09.320
Calm down, Picasso.
I think you'll be fine.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.600
There she is.

29:10.640 --> 29:14.280
The newest sacrifice to
the whims of the Twitterverse.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.960
Charles knows all.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.200
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.320
- Come on, you two.
- Coming.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.320
Thanks for this.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.920
Thank you for asking.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.400
Welcome. Come on in.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.680
- You know this artist?
- He cut off his ear.

29:43.720 --> 29:47.640
Poor Vincent. You probably made
more yesterday

29:47.680 --> 29:50.440
than he did in his whole career.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.640
Now he's called a genius.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.640
I bet people
didn't laugh at him.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.440
Oh, but they did. Even his own
mother thought he was a joke.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.680
Like Dad does me.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.480
An embryonic radical like you

30:03.520 --> 30:05.880
believing what you
read in the papers?

30:05.920 --> 30:08.000
Shame on you.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.320
I have no doubt he was
misquoted. Let it go.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.680
Fine women artists
battling social prejudice.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.040
Marie Bashkirtseff.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.760
Her journal tells us
she cried with rage

30:25.800 --> 30:30.640
because women were blocked from
the main art school in Paris.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.200
Marie Bracquemond
Talented, self-taught.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.800
Stopped by her new husband
from painting at all.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.320
Suffocated by their times.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.680
You're in good company, Ruby.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.760
All artists suffer.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.160
True artists rise above it

30:51.200 --> 30:53.760
and pour those feelings
into their work.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.960
Take 'Poor White Bears'.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.280
Your empathy for a starving
creature captured on canvas,

31:01.320 --> 31:03.960
your emotion, held there
for the future.

31:08.480 --> 31:12.840
- Who painted this one?
- That one is mine.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.360
Possibly the best thing I've
ever painted.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.960
I took it to the
market one weekend

31:20.000 --> 31:26.480
so confident, but sadly over two
full days, not a single bite.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.640
Perhaps you're
a stronger artist than I

31:28.680 --> 31:33.480
but rather than face the pain of
rejection again, I keep it here.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.680
It may not have sold but it is
exists. That's what matters.

31:37.720 --> 31:42.800
The work itself.
The rest is commerce.

31:42.840 --> 31:48.120
We combine these with
this and we make these.

31:48.160 --> 31:52.280
That eclipses
any momentary blues.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.280
This is the most grown-up
conversation I've ever had.

31:56.320 --> 32:00.960
And one you merit.
Now, pack away your woes,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.720
go home and paint
whatever our talk inspires.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.600
- What, now?
- Mm-hm.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.600
Something serious.
No more poo, I think.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.520
If that feels right.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.000
It's sort of done
but still protest, though.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.760
I want to make a difference.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.520
Then find what needs saying,
say it, and you shall.

32:26.640 --> 32:31.000
Let it free. It'll come out,
one way or another.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.080
You get why Dave
wants to stay, right?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.480
Oh, mate, I do now.
Last few days have felt like

32:45.520 --> 32:47.400
getting off one of
those hamster wheels

32:47.440 --> 32:48.840
that just keeps on turning.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.160
Not sure what I'll get up to
with you and Dad back at work.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.560
- He's a solid bloke, Dave.
- Yeah. He is.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.320
- And Julie.
- Yeah, we lucked out.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.040
Look, my dad
wasn't so great.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.960
Not someone we admired
as kids, let's put it that way.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.080
Look, I've learned a lot from
your old man.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.200
Not just the apprenticeship.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.200
He's been a role model,
and I like having one.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.600
It's a two-way street.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.720
It's been good for him
having you here too.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.560
Cheers. I appreciate that.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.280
Ah, it's true.

33:21.840 --> 33:25.560
Hey, remember that place up on
top of the hill?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.760
The big one? The new place?

33:26.800 --> 33:29.520
Yeah. It's a wellness retreat.
Your dad and I wired it up.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.960
They gave him a voucher
but you should use it.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.280
Oh... That's his.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.920
Dave doing hippy-dippy shit?

33:37.120 --> 33:38.720
No, I really should get back

33:38.760 --> 33:41.080
and get onto
the whole building thing.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.200
Alright, besides,
lots of ladies.

33:44.240 --> 33:50.400
And I saw the board.
'Probing sexual chakras'.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.160
You made that up.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.800
Nuh.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.280
Chakras, mate. Chakras.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.440
- Ben?
- Yeah.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.320
We need to talk.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.480
Sure.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.640
I tried to talk to you last
night but you were asleep.

34:38.640 --> 34:42.600
Babe, if Greece stresses you out
this much, we don't have to...

34:42.640 --> 34:44.680
I don't want the IVF.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.320
I only said yes again
because I love you.

34:48.360 --> 34:51.480
I agree that we shouldn't rush.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.280
We can wait a few cycles,
take as much time as you need.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.200
Ben, please, I'm done.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.360
I'm done with the hormones,
I'm done with the waiting,

35:02.400 --> 35:05.560
my cycles under a microscope.
My cycles!

35:05.600 --> 35:07.080
And the grief!

35:07.120 --> 35:10.280
The grief,
yours as much as mine.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.480
I cannot do it anymore.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.280
You're done? Just like that?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.920
Just... Oh, my God.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.760
Do you have any idea how hard
it's been for me to tell you?

35:21.800 --> 35:24.360
So that's my fault?

35:24.400 --> 35:27.280
You're blaming me because
you couldn't say how you feel?

35:28.440 --> 35:30.960
Name one time that I have
blocked you talking.

35:31.000 --> 35:31.960
One time.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.520
You don't need to because I knew
that you be angry and you are.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.040
I'm finished.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.920
This is our children we're
talking about, Cassie.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.160
Our family,
and you're just finished?

35:45.600 --> 35:50.600
I cannot let it be my life.
I will not let it.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.000
I cannot be a womb on legs.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.200
I'm sorry.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.560
Donna, I've gotta go.
Dave's had an accident.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.560
What's happened?

36:46.600 --> 36:47.680
He's had a bad fall
off his motorbike.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.920
It's his shoulder, his arm,
I'm not sure -

36:48.960 --> 36:50.120
I just have to
get up there, alright?

36:50.160 --> 36:51.640
Of course. Call me
when you know more.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.800
Let us know
when you get there.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.360
I will. I'll call you
as soon as I arrive.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.840
I'll be back soon, OK?

36:57.880 --> 37:00.280
I'm alright.
Don't worry about me.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.840
Tell Dad I hope he feels
better.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.960
I will. He's going to be fine.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Tell my dad I'm good.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.160
Oh! I will, darling.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.760
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.480
- Drive safe.
- I will.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.040
OK.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.480
- Mwah. Bye.
- Bye.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.640
I love you all.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.640
Love you, Mum. Bye.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.200
Bye.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.600
Last corner. You want us to help
you in your pyjamas or...

37:41.640 --> 37:44.760
No, no. I'll just
lie down for a tick.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.160
Here you go.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.400
Yep. Gotcha.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.640
You know what I can't
get out of my head?

38:04.280 --> 38:07.080
That split-second
from when you're in control

38:07.120 --> 38:09.320
and then you're
flying through the air

38:09.360 --> 38:11.280
feeling like you'll never stop.

38:15.680 --> 38:20.880
Until, slam, you do.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.600
And that's when I saw it.

38:29.960 --> 38:34.120
A spike sticking out of a log.
Like a dagger.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.360
Another six inches, it would've
gone straight through me.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.560
You were pretty lucky, eh.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.760
Gives a man perspective,
is all I'm saying.

38:50.280 --> 38:56.200
<i>Dad always the solid one.</i>
<i>Now on shifting sands.</i>

39:03.440 --> 39:06.520
<i>Suddenly the girl</i>
<i>with everything</i>

39:06.560 --> 39:09.840
<i>can feel everything</i>
<i>falling apart.</i>

39:31.200 --> 39:33.200
<i>And Nathan,</i>

39:33.280 --> 39:36.640
<i>the most likely to succeed,</i>
<i>who can't cut a break.</i>

39:51.280 --> 39:55.000
<i>And then there's me.</i>

39:55.040 --> 39:58.400
<i>The most together one</i>
<i>in the family.</i>

40:16.840 --> 40:19.480
You haven't said a word
to me all night.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.280
We will be fine. We are fine.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.440
Ben, we're not fine.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.800
I had to throw down vodka to
get the courage to talk to you.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.800
What does that say about us?

40:31.840 --> 40:35.080
A wife who's too scared
to tell her husband the truth?

40:35.120 --> 40:38.040
A husband who's
too obsessed to hear it.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.280
We need help. A counsellor.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.680
To say what?

40:43.760 --> 40:48.120
I've always wanted my own kids,
Cassie. Always have.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.800
You know how I feel.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.880
We don't need
marriage guidance people

40:51.920 --> 40:53.520
to tell us what we already know.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.040
Well, maybe I do!

40:55.080 --> 40:59.280
For heaven sake, Ben.
Stop lying to yourself.

41:12.600 --> 41:18.560
<i>And just like that, I'm as</i>
<i>screwed up as the rest of them.</i>
