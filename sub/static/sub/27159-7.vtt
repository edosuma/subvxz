WEBVTT

00:05.133 --> 00:09.433
I have spent
over $450,000 on surgery.

00:09.467 --> 00:12.133
[Dr. Dubrow]
You could easily
turn into a disaster.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.400
We have an expression
in this country--

00:13.433 --> 00:15.367
Put a fork in it.
You're done.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.166
When I see my breasts now,
it's gut-wrenching.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.600
They're so deformed.

00:19.633 --> 00:21.367
When I woke up
from anesthesia,

00:21.400 --> 00:24.500
the nurse said, "Surprise.
We fit 500 in you."

00:24.533 --> 00:26.567
And my jaw dropped.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.033
I had a doctor look at me
and go, "Are you sure

00:30.066 --> 00:31.600
"that was a surgeon
that actually did that

00:31.633 --> 00:33.066
and not an intern?"

00:33.100 --> 00:35.266
My body looks
like Frankenstein.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.367
[Dubrow]
That skin could all
die on us.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.367
[bleep]

00:39.400 --> 00:41.266
Is this gonna be
a disaster?

00:41.300 --> 00:42.567
Only one way to find out.

[Ann Marie]
You ready? I'm gonna
kick your butt.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.066
You think we should have
brought Ashley with us?

01:05.100 --> 01:07.600
No, I want to go
on a date with you.
This is nice. Oh.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.200
Fudd!
Fantastic.

01:09.233 --> 01:10.533
[laughing]

01:10.567 --> 01:13.533
My name is Ann Marie.
I'm 46 years old,

01:13.567 --> 01:16.433
and my body looks
like Frankenstein.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.600
I grew up
in Queens, New York--

01:19.633 --> 01:22.033
Jackson Heights,
to be exact--

01:22.066 --> 01:24.533
and I met John
while I was working
at the U.S. Open,

01:24.567 --> 01:26.467
and John was supposed to be

01:26.500 --> 01:28.433
my one-night stand.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.433
It was just so horrible.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.433
But he was such a great guy

01:33.467 --> 01:35.333
that I just never let him go.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.100
When we had our daughter,
my husband said,

01:37.133 --> 01:38.266
"We can't raise her
in the city.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.333
Let's go to Charleston."

01:39.367 --> 01:40.367
I said, "Let's go."

01:40.400 --> 01:41.667
And about a month later,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.333
I got diagnosed
with breast cancer.

01:43.367 --> 01:46.300
I was shocked.
I just wanted it out.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.500
The doctors said they could
do it in one surgery,

01:48.533 --> 01:51.166
and they removed
the breast tissue

01:51.200 --> 01:53.133
through the areola hole,

01:53.166 --> 01:55.600
and then took
my abdominal fat

01:55.633 --> 01:58.233
and created new breasts
out of it,

01:58.266 --> 02:01.467
then also took skin grafts
from my stomach

02:01.500 --> 02:03.333
and made new areolas.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.567
After my surgery,

02:04.600 --> 02:06.100
I started to notice

02:06.133 --> 02:09.200
that my skin
was starting to erode.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.333
It's called necrosis,

02:10.367 --> 02:13.400
and it means
that my skin was dying.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.200
It turned black and hard.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.500
The doctor started
cutting the necrosis

02:17.533 --> 02:19.166
off of my body,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.567
as my husband
cringed and watched.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.700
Afterwards,

02:22.734 --> 02:26.667
he instructed me
to stuff the holes...

02:29.367 --> 02:30.500
with...

02:32.633 --> 02:34.700
saline-soaked gauze.

02:34.734 --> 02:38.533
There were times
that I would just tremble

02:38.567 --> 02:41.633
'cause it smelled like death.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.367
It tore me apart.
It really did.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.633
I went to Charleston

02:45.667 --> 02:47.433
to live and enjoy my life

02:47.467 --> 02:49.400
with my husband, my daughter.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.233
This was our dream starting,

02:52.266 --> 02:55.467
and the necrosis
took a lot of that away.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.734
It took me away.

03:00.567 --> 03:03.633
The doctor mentioned
going back in

03:03.667 --> 03:05.433
for a second surgery

03:05.467 --> 03:07.367
to add nipples

03:07.400 --> 03:09.600
and to cut out
some of the scarring

03:09.633 --> 03:11.367
that had happened
with the necrosis.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.533
And when I woke up,

03:14.567 --> 03:17.500
I had more scars
than I had before,

03:17.533 --> 03:20.433
plus he added nipples
that kind of looked like, uh,

03:20.467 --> 03:22.400
a patchwork quilt.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.367
That's better, though.
Look.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.700
[John laughs]

03:26.734 --> 03:28.433
Yes.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.633
I reached out to Dr. Dubrow

03:30.667 --> 03:32.667
and Dr. Nassif because

03:32.700 --> 03:35.166
getting fixed,
it's definitely

03:35.200 --> 03:38.400
my way to say
"Screw you, cancer.
Screw you."

03:38.433 --> 03:41.567
I'm really hoping
that they'll fix me

03:41.600 --> 03:43.467
and make me normal again

03:43.500 --> 03:45.266
so I can be your--

03:45.300 --> 03:47.266
First of all,
you-- you are normal.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.533
I'm not normal.
Well...

03:49.567 --> 03:50.734
It's nice to know

03:50.767 --> 03:52.233
that John's there,

03:52.266 --> 03:53.667
but I feel bad that

03:53.700 --> 03:55.600
I don't look good for him.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.467
This is before the surgery.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.600
See that smile?

03:58.633 --> 04:00.533
That's what I'm hoping for.

04:00.567 --> 04:02.734
I want this girl to come back.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.633
The smile in that photo

04:04.667 --> 04:06.500
is the old Ann Marie,
the happy Ann Marie.

04:06.533 --> 04:08.367
It's been a rough year.
I don't want

04:08.400 --> 04:10.300
to see her
that way anymore.
I want to see her happy.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.767
Okay,
so want to bowl more?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.266
Let's bowl more.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.500
I'm Laura Necia,

04:17.533 --> 04:18.767
and I'm striving

04:19.000 --> 04:21.600
for ultimate perfection,
darling.

04:21.633 --> 04:26.200
I have spent over
$450,000 on surgery.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.433
My friends think that I'm
a little bit cray-cray

04:28.467 --> 04:30.333
and I'm putting
my life at risk,

04:30.367 --> 04:31.767
and I can totally
see their point,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.500
but I'm not listening,
and I'm not stopping.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.300
[chuckling]

04:36.333 --> 04:38.300
My addiction
to cosmetic surgery

04:38.333 --> 04:39.700
started when I
was quite young.

04:39.734 --> 04:43.633
Before surgery, I was an
absolute fugly down-and-out.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.266
And I know it sounds
quite shallow to say it,

04:46.300 --> 04:48.533
but at the time
I had nothing else to do.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.233
I wasn't very brainy,

04:50.266 --> 04:51.600
and I thought if I had

04:51.633 --> 04:53.233
a little bit
of plastic surgery,

04:53.266 --> 04:55.367
my life would change
for the better.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.000
I was about 18
when I first got my surgery

04:58.033 --> 04:59.734
for my boobs.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.767
My dad, he's been
really clever. He said,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.500
"You can have a car,
or you can have a boob job."

05:04.533 --> 05:06.300
And I was like, "Oh, come on.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.300
"You can't take a car
into a club with you.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.433
I'm not that stupid."

05:09.467 --> 05:11.266
I was going for the boobs.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.633
After my first surgery,

05:12.667 --> 05:14.467
I was just obsessed with it.
I was like,

05:14.500 --> 05:16.667
"Wow, you can change
just by going to sleep

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
and waking up
looking beautiful."

05:18.633 --> 05:23.000
I have done around 30
plastic surgery procedures.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.000
I've had hairline tattooing,

05:25.033 --> 05:26.633
six nose jobs,

05:26.667 --> 05:28.433
teeth straightening
and whitening,

05:28.467 --> 05:31.066
two jaw jobs,
two chin jobs.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.400
two lip lifts,

05:32.433 --> 05:34.333
seven boob jobs,

05:34.367 --> 05:35.667
one BBL,

05:35.700 --> 05:37.667
two designer vaginas,

05:37.700 --> 05:40.000
two ear pin-back,

05:40.033 --> 05:41.633
two earlobes done,

05:41.667 --> 05:43.500
two areola reductions,

05:43.533 --> 05:46.467
and a partridge
in a pear tree.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.567
I'm a real hustler. I do

05:48.600 --> 05:50.367
so many different jobs.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.000
I do waitressing, hostessing,

05:52.033 --> 05:53.266
and I'm a model.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.367
But if I have to dress

05:54.400 --> 05:55.467
as a cupcake

05:55.500 --> 05:56.700
and walk around the street,

05:56.734 --> 05:59.567
I don't care.
Anything I will do

05:59.600 --> 06:01.233
for my surgery fund.

06:01.266 --> 06:03.433
Well, nearly anything.

06:04.533 --> 06:05.767
I'm super excited

06:06.000 --> 06:07.633
to meet Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

06:07.667 --> 06:10.667
because at the moment I've
got horrible burger nipples,

06:10.700 --> 06:13.000
and who wants to have
burger nipples? Not me.

06:13.033 --> 06:15.600
I would like my areolas
to look like

06:15.633 --> 06:17.667
small little cute buttons,

06:17.700 --> 06:19.100
chocolate buttons.

06:19.133 --> 06:22.000
Mm, chocolate buttons.
And then I would like

06:22.033 --> 06:23.767
my nose to be
a little bit thinner,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.033
like more chiseled

06:26.066 --> 06:28.300
and not nostrils
that you can see up.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.667
I don't want people to see
up my nostrils, honey.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.467
We want it like that,

06:32.500 --> 06:34.667
like Cindy Crawford,
suit model. Yes.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.000
If Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif

06:37.033 --> 06:38.066
say no,

06:38.100 --> 06:39.533
I will be, like, "Eh?"

06:39.567 --> 06:41.533
I'll be a little bit
confused because,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.333
you know, I'm a work of art,

06:43.367 --> 06:45.066
and who wouldn't
want to be a part

06:45.100 --> 06:48.500
of this amazing
kind of canvas

06:48.533 --> 06:50.567
to stroke those brushes on

06:50.600 --> 06:52.667
and help progress even more

06:52.700 --> 06:55.567
in the pursuit of perfection?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.000
Ho ho ho ho!

07:03.567 --> 07:05.300
This patient Ann Marie

07:05.333 --> 07:09.567
underwent bilateral
DIEP flap reconstruction

07:09.600 --> 07:11.133
after breast cancer,

07:11.166 --> 07:13.600
and suffers from very
significant complications.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.433
Look.
Oh, jeepers.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.133
So--
Looks like she had
a high tummy tuck.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.633
Well, that's the thing.
You get a tummy tuck

07:19.667 --> 07:21.667
when you have
the abdominal tissue taken

07:21.700 --> 07:23.367
to reconstruct
your breasts.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.333
Oh, my God. Can you
please send in Ann Marie?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.433
Hi. Dr. Nassif, Ann Marie.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.533
Hi. Terry Dubrow.
Nice to meet you.

07:31.567 --> 07:32.567
Nice to meet you.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.667
Holy smokes.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.500
Today is the day that I may

07:35.533 --> 07:37.767
actually hear
that I can get fixed

07:38.000 --> 07:40.367
by such genius men.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
Okay, you obviously
were diagnosed

07:42.433 --> 07:44.100
with breast cancer,
right? On which side?

07:44.133 --> 07:45.367
Both.
Okay.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.066
So you underwent
a double mastectomy.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
Correct.
And they obviously

07:48.734 --> 07:50.133
gave you
reconstructive options.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.133
They kind of sold
the deep flap--

07:53.166 --> 07:54.734
They did?
...more than anything.

07:54.767 --> 07:58.100
A DIEP flap reconstruction

07:58.133 --> 08:01.400
is where you take the deep
inferior epigastric artery,

08:01.433 --> 08:04.467
which you rotate up,
and you sew in

08:04.500 --> 08:07.066
the artery and the vein
of the flap

08:07.100 --> 08:10.734
into a donor artery
and vein in the chest

08:10.767 --> 08:12.734
to keep that flap alive.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.533
Is that too technical?

08:14.567 --> 08:17.533
I had a doctor look at me
and go, "Are you sure

08:17.567 --> 08:20.133
"that that was a surgeon
that actually did that,

08:20.166 --> 08:23.166
not an intern?" and I was
like, [gasp], "Really?"

08:23.200 --> 08:25.100
How many days
were you in the hospital?

08:25.133 --> 08:26.767
About six days.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.500
They were gonna
send me home after five,

08:29.533 --> 08:31.600
but I had some bruising
on my breast

08:31.633 --> 08:33.433
and on my abdominal area,

08:33.467 --> 08:35.633
basically where I
developed the necrosis.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.467
DIEP flaps
rarely have soft tissue

08:38.500 --> 08:42.767
necrosis because it brings
its own blood supply in.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.200
The fact that it happened
either means

08:45.233 --> 08:46.734
it was a technical mistake,

08:46.767 --> 08:48.600
or post-operatively
something happened

08:48.633 --> 08:50.100
that was not recognized.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.467
So you had these
wound healing issues,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.100
and it left you
with some scarring, right?

08:54.133 --> 08:57.166
Yes. So I decided
to go back in.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.066
The doctor said
he can maybe get rid
of some of the scarring.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.667
Right.
He would make me smaller

09:01.700 --> 09:03.633
and add nipples.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.133
Okay.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.567
And he made m-more scars

09:07.600 --> 09:11.767
and the funny things that
I guess he calls a nipple.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.433
This is a physical

09:13.467 --> 09:14.633
and a mental thing
for Ann Marie right now.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.133
She's hurting a lot.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.533
Every day
she looks in the mirror,

09:17.567 --> 09:19.467
and she's in tears,
basically.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.700
And I don't want her
to suffer anymore.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.734
So tell me what are your
goals with your breasts.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.100
I don't know if you can
get rid of the scarring

09:26.133 --> 09:28.200
because
there's so much scarring.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.000
Right.
And there's a part of me

09:30.033 --> 09:31.467
that kind of
has accepted that.

09:31.500 --> 09:36.200
Mm-hmm.
But I want to not
look in the mirror

09:36.233 --> 09:38.100
and cringe.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.033
Are you here
for your appointment?

09:43.066 --> 09:45.000
Yes. I would like
a bigger arse.

09:45.033 --> 09:47.700
Today I'm gonna try
the butt vacuum.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.100
Am I Nicki Minaj or what?

09:50.133 --> 09:51.700
What I would like
to get back to

09:51.734 --> 09:54.266
is my natural breasts,

09:54.300 --> 09:56.166
removing these implants
entirely.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.567
If I could just
go back to natural,

09:58.600 --> 10:00.467
that would be
a dream come true.

10:03.367 --> 10:05.600
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

10:08.066 --> 10:10.133
Right now,
if I just sort of look

10:10.166 --> 10:12.033
at your breast tissue
the way it is,

10:12.066 --> 10:13.567
normally we like
to see the distance

10:13.600 --> 10:16.033
between the sternum
and here to be about 21,

10:16.066 --> 10:20.000
and you're about 29
on the left,

10:20.033 --> 10:22.600
and you're about 29
on the right,

10:22.633 --> 10:24.000
which means you have a--

10:24.033 --> 10:25.667
Oh, see, I thought
one was way longer.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.000
One mound is, but the nipples
are pretty even, okay?

10:29.033 --> 10:34.033
If I said to you,
"How about we lift them up

10:34.066 --> 10:36.166
"and, as we're going along,

10:36.200 --> 10:40.300
we try to remove
as much scar and possible

10:40.333 --> 10:43.000
and I got you to be
sort of a full C,"

10:43.033 --> 10:44.266
would that work for you?

10:44.300 --> 10:46.033
Small C?

10:46.066 --> 10:47.567
You want to be smaller?
Okay.
Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.300
Small C would be fine.
You'd be cool with that?

10:49.333 --> 10:51.333
Yes.
And if I had to

10:51.367 --> 10:53.700
remove these nipples
they made

10:53.734 --> 10:55.400
and remove
this skin paddle--

10:55.433 --> 10:57.133
Go for it.
Go for it, right?

10:57.166 --> 10:58.367
'Cause they look
like patchwork.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
They do.
So that makes it easier.

11:00.433 --> 11:03.567
If Terry is able
to perform this surgery,

11:03.600 --> 11:05.400
Ann Marie will have
the opportunity

11:05.433 --> 11:06.734
to use our tattoo artist

11:06.767 --> 11:08.166
that we have on staff

11:08.200 --> 11:10.133
who will make
nipples for her

11:10.166 --> 11:11.433
and give her a good result.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.066
Can I see your tummy
for a second?

11:13.100 --> 11:14.767
Show me what you don't
like about your tummy.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.433
Okay. You see this here?
Yeah.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.333
And then look
when I turn this way.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.133
Okay, so this is
poochier than this.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.433
Yes.
So if you could get--

11:21.467 --> 11:23.333
And it's crooked.
Right.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.000
Ann Marie actually needs

11:25.033 --> 11:27.233
a very significant
operation on the breasts,

11:27.266 --> 11:31.400
and I essentially
have to completely redo
the tummy tuck portion

11:31.433 --> 11:34.300
in order to give her
an acceptable result.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.266
I think we can do
something really nice.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.166
I really do. I do.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.700
I think we can do
something nice, okay?

11:39.734 --> 11:41.100
I really will.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.367
It's a perfect day
for meditating.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.000
Let's run a little
earth and cosmic energy.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.767
Shall we?
Sounds good.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.100
My name is Danielle.

11:53.133 --> 11:54.367
I'm a psychic
from San Diego.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.767
When I see my breasts now,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.200
it's gut-wrenching.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.667
They're so deformed,

11:58.700 --> 12:01.300
and I want these
implants taken out.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.133
Growing up, I was surrounded

12:03.166 --> 12:06.300
by beautiful big-breasted
family members.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.200
And I was Danielle Two-backs.

12:08.233 --> 12:10.700
I had a back on the front
and a back on the back.

12:10.734 --> 12:13.200
I wanted breast
implants so bad.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.734
My sophomore year
in high school,

12:14.767 --> 12:16.467
me and my friends
decided to dress up

12:16.500 --> 12:18.266
as Hooters girls
for Halloween,

12:18.300 --> 12:21.300
and we put in
pudding-filled balloons

12:21.333 --> 12:23.133
for our hooters.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.066
Unfortunately,
by the eighth period,

12:25.100 --> 12:26.367
a pin popped them by accident,

12:26.400 --> 12:29.133
and-- [gasp]--
pudding everywhere.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.433
After that, senior year,
I became a real Hooters girl

12:32.467 --> 12:34.300
and decided to go
not with the pudding,

12:34.333 --> 12:35.767
go with the silicone.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.066
I was referred to a doctor

12:38.100 --> 12:39.500
by a fellow Hooters girl.

12:39.533 --> 12:42.033
The first boob job
was perfect--

12:42.066 --> 12:44.433
the right size,
anatomically correct.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.166
I couldn't have asked
for anything better.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.000
But unfortunately,
within a year,

12:49.033 --> 12:50.066
they capsulized.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.300
They were hard as a rock,

12:51.333 --> 12:53.033
so sleeping
was a challenge.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.500
Exercising was a challenge.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.433
Everyday life
became a challenge.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.667
After two years,

12:57.700 --> 12:59.667
I decided it was time to get

12:59.700 --> 13:01.033
my second surgery.

13:01.066 --> 13:03.100
My doctor
replaced the implants,

13:03.133 --> 13:04.700
but, less than
six months later,

13:04.734 --> 13:07.400
my breast implants
started to recapsulize.

13:07.433 --> 13:10.433
Having breast implants
that are literally almost

13:10.467 --> 13:11.767
into your armpits

13:12.000 --> 13:13.767
and completely being squeezed

13:14.000 --> 13:16.100
by capsulized scar tissue

13:16.133 --> 13:18.700
is the most uncomfortable
experience.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.433
What I would like
to get back to

13:20.467 --> 13:22.767
is my natural breasts,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.233
removing these implants
entirely,

13:25.266 --> 13:26.233
and just being

13:26.266 --> 13:28.100
natural breast tissue.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.200
So you ready
for all this?

13:30.233 --> 13:31.333
You know, I thought

13:31.367 --> 13:33.066
I would be a whole lot
more nervous,

13:33.100 --> 13:34.533
but I'm getting
really excited.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.367
Pearl is my wife
of two years.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.166
After we got married,
we had our son Cruz,

13:39.200 --> 13:40.734
who is 2 years old.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.533
Having a family
means the world to me.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.200
If it wasn't for my son
and my wife,

13:45.233 --> 13:47.233
I'm not sure that I would
have really been able

13:47.266 --> 13:50.467
to get in touch with
what beauty really means,

13:50.500 --> 13:53.033
and that's inside,
not the outside.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.333
If I could just
go back to natural,

13:55.367 --> 13:57.066
that would be
a dream come true.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.233
I've grown
into a new woman,

13:59.266 --> 14:02.333
and I'm in a whole different
place in my life now.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.300
When I was 25,

14:04.333 --> 14:06.467
me and my best friend were,
walking in Barnes & Noble

14:06.500 --> 14:10.433
and this box that's
called the Psychic Circle
Angel Message Board

14:10.467 --> 14:13.033
literally fell off the shelf
and hit me in the head,

14:13.066 --> 14:15.066
and I said, "Well,
this only means one thing--

14:15.100 --> 14:17.000
I got to buy it."
And after that,

14:17.033 --> 14:18.433
I went into
a three-year study

14:18.467 --> 14:19.500
so I could become

14:19.533 --> 14:21.133
a psychic healer.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.166
I think
it's the time now.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.467
You'll
feel more comfortable

14:24.500 --> 14:27.166
and be able to express
yourself better.

14:28.266 --> 14:29.467
I love you.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.333
I love you, too.
Let's go.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.166
Hello.
Hello, darling.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.567
Are you here
for your appointment?

14:42.600 --> 14:45.066
Yes. I would like
a bigger arse.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.333
I am willing
to try anything once,

14:46.367 --> 14:48.500
literally anything,
even if you said

14:48.533 --> 14:50.066
"Horse [bleep] on your face

14:50.100 --> 14:51.600
is gonna make you look
five years younger,"

14:51.633 --> 14:54.100
I'd be like,
"Mix me up a bowl, girl.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.567
I'm gonna put it
on my face."

14:55.600 --> 14:59.467
And today I'm gonna
try a new procedure,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.433
and it's called
the butt vacuum.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.000
You excited?

15:03.033 --> 15:04.467
Yeah, I'm so excited.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.600
I just want
a bigger butt.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.200
Do you think
you have a small bum?

15:07.233 --> 15:09.300
No, I think I have
a really nice bum now,

15:09.333 --> 15:10.367
but I'll do anything
to get it bigger.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
This is quite extreme,
I'd say.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.567
Laura would literally
do anything

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
to get her body better,

15:15.233 --> 15:17.233
so any latest trend,
she's on it,

15:17.266 --> 15:18.533
but I do think it's a stage

15:18.567 --> 15:20.100
where it could go too far.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.066
So tell us, Janice,
how does it work?

15:22.100 --> 15:23.633
We use all your fat--
Uh-huh.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.133
...and squeeze it
all the way to your glutes.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.367
That way, it grows.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.133
Okay. Whoo!

15:30.400 --> 15:32.433
Happening.
It won't take long.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.200
Your bum's sucking
into the thing like that.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.333
My ultimate goal is to be

15:37.367 --> 15:38.533
totally happy in my eyes,

15:38.567 --> 15:40.266
and I think
I'm nearly there.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.400
I just need to do
a few more tweaks,

15:42.433 --> 15:44.400
and I will be complete.

15:44.433 --> 15:46.266
So you're more excited
to see the doctors now?

15:46.300 --> 15:49.467
Yeah. Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

15:49.500 --> 15:51.400
are meant to be
the best doctors in L.A.

15:51.433 --> 15:52.633
So if they can't fix me,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.400
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.433
I don't think you need
your nose at all.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.266
Like, I think
your nose is lovely.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.600
But I want it.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.433
I've spoken to Laura
quite a lot

16:01.467 --> 16:03.333
about plastic surgery,

16:03.367 --> 16:05.633
and I don't think
she actually knows
what perfect is.

16:05.667 --> 16:08.133
She looks great,
so that should be enough,

16:08.166 --> 16:10.200
but if they
don't think that, then
you can't tell them.

16:10.233 --> 16:11.300
All rightie.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.266
Oh, thank God that's finished.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.467
Am I Nicki Minaj or what?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500

an appointment with you

16:17.533 --> 16:18.500
for a consultation,

16:18.533 --> 16:20.300
I had a visitation

16:20.333 --> 16:22.300
from someone
who calls themselves

16:22.333 --> 16:25.233
Granny
or Grandma Nassif.

16:25.266 --> 16:26.433
It's gonna work.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.166
If I cut the main artery,

16:29.200 --> 16:31.300
I'm gonna kill
the entire breast.

Terry, you know there's
more to being a good surgeon

17:22.667 --> 17:24.400
than just wielding a scalpel.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.200
There's a little thing
called bedside manner.

17:27.233 --> 17:28.467
You might want to try it.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.467
Our next patient
is named Danielle.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.533
Let me show you.
Oh.

17:32.567 --> 17:36.333
That's a really extreme case
of capsular contraction.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.000
And by the way,
she's a psychic.

17:39.033 --> 17:40.467
So--
A real psychic?

17:40.500 --> 17:42.467
The real thing.
Let's call her in.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.667
Can you please
send in Danielle?

17:45.233 --> 17:46.600
Here she is.
Hi.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.467
Hi. Dr. Nassif.
Nice to meet you.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.500
Hi, Danielle.
Terry Dubrow.

17:49.533 --> 17:50.667
Hi. Nice to meet you.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.734
Right now,
going back to natural

17:52.767 --> 17:54.667
is the most
important thing.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.734
If Dr. Dubrow suggests
that getting an implant

17:57.767 --> 17:59.767
would be a better way
for me to go,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.633
I'm against the idea.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.400
Two things
we know about you

18:03.433 --> 18:04.767
that are very significant.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.266
1, you have capsular
contraction. Okay?

18:08.300 --> 18:10.266
And the second thing
we know about you

18:10.300 --> 18:12.233
is you're a psychic
clairvoyant, right?

18:12.266 --> 18:13.266
Correct.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.500
So, obviously,

18:14.533 --> 18:16.367
we're very fascinated
with that.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.500
Well, when I was setting
an appointment with you

18:18.533 --> 18:19.667
for a consultation,

18:19.700 --> 18:23.367
I had a visitation
from someone

18:23.400 --> 18:27.333
who calls themselves Granny
or Grandma Nassif, and--

18:27.367 --> 18:29.633
His grandmother.
His-- His mother.
But she--

18:29.667 --> 18:31.066
His mother?
His mother.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.300
But she's coming
as if she was recognized

18:34.333 --> 18:36.500
as a grandma figure.
Okay.

18:39.266 --> 18:43.100
So my mother was recognized
as a grandmother figure,

18:43.133 --> 18:45.633
which she has grandkids.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.667
Did she ever meet the kids?
Not my kids.

18:47.700 --> 18:51.767
My mother died right after
I got married, so--

18:52.000 --> 18:54.533
Well, your mother's
with you on your journey.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.000
Thank you.

18:56.033 --> 18:58.367
That's very sweet,
actually.

18:59.533 --> 19:01.734
Hearing a message from my mom,

19:01.767 --> 19:05.433
obviously, that just gets me

19:05.467 --> 19:07.266
right to the point of,
you know, just breaking down.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.667
My mom and I
were super close,

19:08.700 --> 19:10.033
and I miss her a lot.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.700
Okay, so take us back

19:11.734 --> 19:13.734
to the first time
you had breast surgery.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.734
I was about 19,

19:15.767 --> 19:18.266
and he did a great job,

19:18.300 --> 19:20.734
but within two years,
they were hard as a rock.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.567
Were they silicone
or saline?

19:22.600 --> 19:24.433
Silicone
on top of the muscle,

19:24.467 --> 19:27.600
and two years later
I got them removed.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.066
It was a different doctor,

19:29.100 --> 19:30.700
and I wanted to replace them

19:30.734 --> 19:33.500
with a 400-CC implant,

19:33.533 --> 19:35.567
but, when I woke up
from anesthesia,

19:35.600 --> 19:39.133
the nurse said, "Surprise.
We fit 500 in you."

19:39.166 --> 19:41.033
And my jaw dropped.

19:41.066 --> 19:44.066
So I was very disappointed
from the start,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.000
and within six months,

19:46.033 --> 19:47.533
they're already
capsulized again.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.700
Yeah. Of course.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.333
In a smaller person
like Danielle,

19:50.367 --> 19:52.000
the last thing you want to do

19:52.033 --> 19:54.700
is use a large implant
because it will cause

19:54.734 --> 19:56.667
more scar tissue to form.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.100
In addition, you should
never do something

19:59.133 --> 20:02.467
that you don't discuss
with the patient beforehand.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.000
What are you expecting?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.133
Well, I would--
What would you be happy with?

20:06.166 --> 20:09.400
I would be happy with
just getting them out.

20:09.433 --> 20:12.367
If I could get back to natural,
that would be awesome.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.100
Really?
Yeah.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.333
Good. All right,
so why don't we go
into the exam room

20:16.367 --> 20:17.700
and have a look?
Okay.

20:17.734 --> 20:19.734
Sometimes it's better
to take breast implants out,

20:19.767 --> 20:21.734
especially in cases
like Danielle,

20:21.767 --> 20:24.533
who's had a lot
of complications
up to this point.

20:24.567 --> 20:27.333
Breast implants
are not for everyone.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.533
Raise your arms.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.433
Look at this.
Look how distorted this is.

20:31.467 --> 20:34.367
So the scar tissue
has squeezed down
around there so much

20:34.400 --> 20:37.100
that it's causing
a concavity here

20:37.133 --> 20:39.567
and an outpouching
of the implant here.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.700
so let me see something now.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.633
Hold just like this
for one second.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.767
You have
what I would estimate

20:45.000 --> 20:48.133
a 3-centimeter thickness
of your own breast tissue.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.633
Hmm.
That's actually very good.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.500
Okay, if you take
the implants out,

20:52.533 --> 20:55.667
take the scar tissue,
obviously, along with it,

20:55.700 --> 20:58.734
I do believe I could do
an internal breast lift
or something.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.166
That's a tougher way
for me to get a good result

21:01.200 --> 21:03.133
because the implants
is kind of cheating.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.600
Yeah.
Makes the breasts
always look better.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.533
Danielle's case
is weirdly tricky.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.066
Although it's very
straightforward

21:09.100 --> 21:10.633
to just take
the implants out,

21:10.667 --> 21:13.100
it's much harder
to give her fullness

21:13.133 --> 21:16.467
based upon her own
deflated breast tissue.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.633
What's the scarring risk
on getting them taken out?

21:20.667 --> 21:22.767
No scars except for that
teeny little invisible one

21:23.000 --> 21:24.400
at the bottom of the areola.

21:24.433 --> 21:25.767
[Danielle]
I'm very excited.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.400
There's a toxic situation
in my body

21:28.433 --> 21:30.233
that needs to be let go of.

21:30.266 --> 21:31.667
It's time to get them out.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.467
All right,
I feel good about that.
All rightie.

Hello.

How are you?

21:39.066 --> 21:40.567
Good to see you.
Likewise.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.133
So you know I do this
for a living, right?

21:45.166 --> 21:48.200
I live for challenging cases.
You know that, right?

21:48.233 --> 21:50.133
Yeah.
But here's the thing.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.533
This underlying tissue

21:53.567 --> 21:56.200
is supplied
by a little artery and vein

21:56.233 --> 21:58.567
that's attached
to an artery and vein here.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.533
If I get into that area
in my manipulation,

22:02.567 --> 22:04.000
the whole thing
could die on me.

22:04.033 --> 22:08.066
That is definitely
a possibility.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.533
The big hurdle today
is that I don't know

22:10.567 --> 22:13.467
what I'm gonna find inside
Ann Marie's breast tissue

22:13.500 --> 22:17.033
because some of it
will be scarred-up,
old dead breast tissue

22:17.066 --> 22:18.767
and some of it
will be alive,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
and I don't know

22:20.033 --> 22:22.500
where the dead stuff ends

22:22.533 --> 22:24.066
and the live stuff starts,

22:24.100 --> 22:25.700
so it's very possible

22:25.734 --> 22:28.066
that this could be
a complete disaster.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.567
For Ann Marie's surgery,
I will start

22:34.600 --> 22:37.467
by excising the reconstructed
nipples from her mounds

22:37.500 --> 22:39.700
and perform a lift
by removing excess skin

22:39.734 --> 22:41.600
to give her
symmetric breasts.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.433
Then I'll move
on to her tummy

22:43.467 --> 22:44.700
and perform liposuction

22:44.734 --> 22:46.066
before making an incision

22:46.100 --> 22:47.600
at the bottom of her abdomen.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.567
I'll then create
a new belly button,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.133
tighten her abdominal wall,

22:51.166 --> 22:53.200
and remove excess skin
and the dog ears

22:53.233 --> 22:55.166
to achieve a natural contour.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.500
It's very rare that both
the abdomen and the breasts

22:58.533 --> 23:02.066
represent such a significant
challenge in one patient.

23:02.100 --> 23:06.000
Okay, let's start by just
experimenting with shape.

23:06.033 --> 23:07.667
So what if we did this?

23:07.700 --> 23:10.567
[stapling]

23:10.600 --> 23:12.000
Good job.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.500
All right, so we're
sort of trying it on

23:13.533 --> 23:15.000
without committing to it.

23:18.734 --> 23:20.467
See where that arrow is?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.734

die on us.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.600
Is this gonna be a disaster?

23:26.633 --> 23:29.266
Although I have a good plan
for Ann Marie,

23:29.300 --> 23:31.600
once I actually make
an incision,

23:31.633 --> 23:36.000
if I cut the main artery
to that flap,

23:36.033 --> 23:38.233
I'm gonna kill
the entire breast.

23:39.233 --> 23:40.600
It's gonna work.

23:40.633 --> 23:42.266
Only one way to find out.

I must say your breasts
look pretty good.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.300
It's just the burger nipples
I'm not happy with.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.600
They look like beef burgers.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.000
The breasts were very
difficult to start with,

24:55.033 --> 24:59.333
but the good news is
the tissue looks very alive.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.066

is I have no idea

25:01.100 --> 25:02.367
what I'm gonna find
in the abdomen.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.166
Let's start by
making an incision

25:05.200 --> 25:08.033
through her previous scar.

25:13.066 --> 25:14.467
We're tightening the muscle,

25:14.500 --> 25:17.333
and that's going smoothly.

25:17.367 --> 25:21.300
Then we're going to try
to lower the incision

25:21.333 --> 25:23.433
and remove the lower
portion of the skin

25:23.467 --> 25:25.467
to allow the scar
to be much lower,

25:25.500 --> 25:27.233
and then remove the dog ears.

25:30.433 --> 25:33.033
So that's one of the dog ears.

25:33.066 --> 25:34.166
It's a big one.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.300
Seems like a snake.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.266
Okay. We just finished
the stomach,

25:48.300 --> 25:51.300
and, looking
at the breast skin,

25:51.333 --> 25:52.734
it's completely alive,

25:52.767 --> 25:54.734
meaning the blood
supply is good.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.734
This was an extraordinarily
difficult operation.

25:56.767 --> 25:59.433
I went in with a lot of fear,

25:59.467 --> 26:01.300
but I'm coming out
the other side

26:01.333 --> 26:03.734

26:09.233 --> 26:10.767

26:54.133 --> 26:56.000
I do love Botox.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.066
Let's go to this patient.
Her name is Laura.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.433
She has had
a lot of plastic surgery,

27:00.467 --> 27:02.300
but most of it
looks pretty good.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.333
Let me show you what we're
talking about here.

27:04.367 --> 27:05.600
All right,
she had her nose done.

27:05.633 --> 27:07.367
She has lips injected.
Lips.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.200
She's got some brow
situations going on.

27:10.233 --> 27:12.333
But her breasts
look pretty good.

27:12.367 --> 27:14.233
So why don't you
bring in Laura?

27:14.266 --> 27:15.767
Let's figure out
what we can do for her.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.333
Can you please send in Laura?

27:19.066 --> 27:20.300
Hi.
Hi, Laura.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.033
Hi, Laura. Dr. Nassif.
Nice to meet you.

27:22.066 --> 27:23.600
Laura. We kiss in England.

27:23.633 --> 27:25.233
Oh. Oh, you're English.
Hi.

27:25.266 --> 27:27.066
I can't wait for Dr. Nassif

27:27.100 --> 27:28.233
and Dr. Dubrow to tell me

27:28.266 --> 27:29.367
"Yes, we can help you."

27:29.400 --> 27:30.533
I'm going for perfection,

27:30.567 --> 27:32.000
but I'm also

27:32.033 --> 27:33.233
a greedy little piggie.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.233
I have to go big or go home,

27:35.266 --> 27:36.400
and I ain't going home.

27:36.433 --> 27:38.367
It took me 11 hours
to fly here.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.500
I want to hear
the whole story, though,
how much stuff she's had.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.166
Um--
And when did they start?

27:42.200 --> 27:43.233
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.200
They started
when I was 18.

27:45.233 --> 27:47.133
First I've had
hairline tattoo.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.600
Okay.
Blepharoplasty of eyes,

27:49.633 --> 27:51.533
every part of my face

27:51.567 --> 27:53.533
that can be
Botoxed and filled,

27:53.567 --> 27:56.633
six nose jobs,
seven boob jobs,

27:56.667 --> 27:58.467
BBL.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.000
I've even had filler
on the balls of my feet

28:01.033 --> 28:03.533
because I wear a lot
of high heel shoes.

28:03.567 --> 28:05.533
Okay.
And instead of putting
those party pads in--

28:05.567 --> 28:07.467
Yeah.
...I put the party pads
in my feet.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.533
Right.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.033
You could spend

28:10.066 --> 28:11.266
a thousand dollars

28:11.300 --> 28:13.467
injecting filler
in your feet

28:13.500 --> 28:15.033
to cushion them
for your shoes,

28:15.066 --> 28:18.200
or, you know,
about $1.80 for,

28:18.233 --> 28:20.066
I don't know, a cushion?

28:20.100 --> 28:24.266
So, of those 30 operations
that you've had--

28:24.300 --> 28:26.567
Uh-huh.
...how many complications
do you think you've had?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.433
If I've had 30 operations,
probably about 20.

28:29.467 --> 28:30.600
Complications?
Yes.

28:30.633 --> 28:32.233
Okay.
I've been trying

28:32.266 --> 28:35.133
to get my boobs
as perfection as I can.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.667
I've had so many operations,
like seven.

28:37.700 --> 28:40.100
What do you keep doing,
replacing the implants?

28:40.133 --> 28:41.500
Taking them out,
replacing them--

28:41.533 --> 28:43.233
on top of the muscle,
behind the muscle,

28:43.266 --> 28:45.133
high profile, low profile,

28:45.166 --> 28:46.600
saline, silicone,

28:46.633 --> 28:48.333
teardrop, round,

28:48.367 --> 28:50.467
every which possible way.
Why?

28:50.500 --> 28:53.266
Because every time
I get them done,
I get a problem.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.567
So what are the problems
you've got?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.033
Double bubble.
Okay.

28:56.066 --> 28:57.433
Rippling.
Okay.

28:57.467 --> 28:59.400
But I must say your breasts
look pretty good.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.433
It's just the burger nipples
I'm not happy with.

29:01.467 --> 29:03.433
What did you call it?
Burger nipples.

29:03.467 --> 29:05.333
They look like beef burgers
on my nipples.

29:05.367 --> 29:07.066
Burger nipples.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.600
Burger nipples.

29:08.633 --> 29:13.333
So coming to us, what would be
potentially your goals next?

29:13.367 --> 29:15.200
I don't like
the burger nipple--

29:15.233 --> 29:16.333
Okay.
...and I just want it smaller.

29:16.367 --> 29:18.233
And my nose. I feel like,

29:18.266 --> 29:19.600
because he took too much
off here,

29:19.633 --> 29:21.433
it kind of pulled it up a bit.
Do you know what I mean?

29:21.467 --> 29:23.266
I love Alie's nose.
Turn to the side.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.600
Are you addicted
to plastic surgery?

29:26.633 --> 29:29.567
Yes, totally.
I absolutely am.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.166
Do you know what that means?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.333
That means you're never
going to be happy

29:33.367 --> 29:35.200
with any surgical procedure,

29:35.233 --> 29:38.467
therefore you should stop
maybe--
Doing surgery. I know.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.467
Maybe.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
Maybe.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.467
Laura admitting she's
addicted to plastic surgery

29:43.500 --> 29:45.300
is definitely a red flag.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.400
Our next step is to do
a careful examination of her

29:48.433 --> 29:50.533
and see whether she actually
has valid issues

29:50.567 --> 29:52.233
regarding her breasts
and her nose

29:52.266 --> 29:53.667
or it's the addiction
talking.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.367
I think the next thing to do
is go to the exam room.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.500
Okay.

29:57.533 --> 29:59.266
I want to see
what the breasts look like

29:59.300 --> 30:03.166
in terms of the skin because
I don't want a disaster.

30:04.467 --> 30:05.700
It's too dangerous.

30:05.734 --> 30:07.433
Laura really
needs to understand

30:07.467 --> 30:09.633
that's exactly
how people end up

30:09.667 --> 30:11.266
on our operating table.

30:14.767 --> 30:17.033
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

30:21.266 --> 30:22.567
Don't look. Don't look.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.033
Oh, she doesn't have
her makeup on.

30:24.066 --> 30:25.600
[laughing]
Oh, my goodness.

30:25.633 --> 30:27.533
I thought you were like,
"Is that the same girl?"

30:27.567 --> 30:29.200
As long as I've known Laura,

30:29.233 --> 30:30.700
she's been getting
plastic surgery.

30:30.734 --> 30:32.600
Obviously, she's not
happy with herself,

30:32.633 --> 30:35.433
but I just don't want her
to go over the top.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.367
Let me feel your nose.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.266
Is there a line
or a scar on your nose?

30:39.300 --> 30:40.433
I've had two lip lifts.

30:41.467 --> 30:43.266
Huh.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.767
So let's have a look
at the breasts.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.500
They're soft.
Hmm. Yeah.

30:46.533 --> 30:47.767
They're really soft.
I had to massage them a lot.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.633
Yeah. Okay. To achieve
an areola reduction

30:50.667 --> 30:52.033
that'll remain stable

30:52.066 --> 30:55.500
is to greatly downsize
your breast implants.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.000
Okay.

30:57.033 --> 30:59.433
Laura really needs
to understand

30:59.467 --> 31:02.367
that the plastic surgery
she has

31:02.400 --> 31:05.367
has already made her
look really good

31:05.400 --> 31:07.367
and that striving
for perfection

31:07.400 --> 31:10.000
is exactly how people
get into trouble

31:10.033 --> 31:12.367
and end up
on our operating table.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.066
[Nassif]
Here's the problem
with your nose.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.533
Your skin
is very, very tight.

31:16.567 --> 31:18.333
You've had six surgeries

31:18.367 --> 31:19.333
and two lip lifts.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.266
The seventh surgery

31:21.300 --> 31:23.000
could compromise your skin

31:23.033 --> 31:24.533
and you have tissue death.

31:24.567 --> 31:25.700
Okay.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.367
It's too dangerous.
Yeah.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.000
In addition, I think
the breasts look pretty good.

31:30.033 --> 31:31.333
We have an expression
in this country--

31:31.367 --> 31:33.033
Put a fork in it.
You're done.

31:33.066 --> 31:35.066
You're about to go
down to that place

31:35.100 --> 31:38.367
where you could easily
turn into a disaster.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.367
I really think you're done.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.066
I think the disadvantages

31:41.100 --> 31:42.333
greatly outweigh
the advantages.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.300
You look fantastic.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.467
Without makeup
you're beautiful.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.300
Yeah, you really are.
I know you're lying.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.667
No, no, you really are.
You look great.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.000
Final question--
As we walk out

31:54.033 --> 31:57.400
and you think about
whether you're gonna
have more procedures,

31:57.433 --> 31:59.367
you think you will
or you won't?

31:59.400 --> 32:01.100
I think I will.
Uhh.

32:01.133 --> 32:02.633
Just being honest.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.633
I'm definitely never ever

32:04.667 --> 32:06.033
gonna stop getting surgery.

32:06.066 --> 32:07.400
And I know
it's a bit of a cliché,

32:07.433 --> 32:09.033
but I know firsthand

32:09.066 --> 32:10.333
what plastic surgery
can do,

32:10.367 --> 32:11.500
how it can make you feel.

32:11.533 --> 32:12.667
I was an ugly duckling,

32:12.700 --> 32:15.066
and now I'm kind of a swan.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.433
It was a great pleasure
meeting you.

32:16.467 --> 32:17.567
Nice meeting you.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.600
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.133
[Dubrow]
Danielle, how are you?

32:24.166 --> 32:25.433
Great. How are you?
Good.

32:25.467 --> 32:27.100
Do me a favor.
Sit over to the side.

32:27.133 --> 32:29.633
So we're doing something
a little unusual

32:29.667 --> 32:31.100
with you today, okay?

32:31.133 --> 32:32.767
So normally
what we do for this

32:33.000 --> 32:35.333
is we go through the incision,

32:35.367 --> 32:36.700
and then we put a new
pair of implants in.

32:36.734 --> 32:40.400
But you, I think,
have wisely chosen

32:40.433 --> 32:42.433
to remove them.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.600
I will begin
Danielle's surgery

32:47.633 --> 32:50.133
by making incisions
through her previous scars

32:50.166 --> 32:52.066
and them remove her implants.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.033
Next I'll try to give her
a normal contour

32:55.066 --> 32:57.667
by repositioning
her breast and scar tissue

32:57.700 --> 32:59.133
for added fullness.

32:59.166 --> 33:00.734
Ultimately, the goal is

33:00.767 --> 33:02.400
to give her a natural look

33:02.433 --> 33:05.100
to avoid future breast
complications.

33:05.133 --> 33:08.433
So we're gonna go
through her old incision

33:08.467 --> 33:09.700
below her areola

33:09.734 --> 33:12.066
and then assess the implants

33:12.100 --> 33:13.467
and assess the pocket.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.066
All right, let's take
these implants out

33:15.100 --> 33:16.667
and see what's going on.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.567
She has the old variety

33:22.600 --> 33:26.433
of low-profile 500-CC
silicone implants.

33:26.467 --> 33:29.767
We don't really use
those breast implants

33:30.000 --> 33:31.166
very much anymore

33:31.200 --> 33:32.767
because they don't
really give you

33:33.000 --> 33:34.567
what you want
for a breast augmentation,

33:34.600 --> 33:36.500
which is anterior projection

33:36.533 --> 33:38.367
without a lot
of side breast.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.767
Let's look at her scar
tissue for a second.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.767
It's like cobwebs
on the inside or something.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.533
Feel in there.

33:45.567 --> 33:46.600
Oh, yeah.

33:46.633 --> 33:47.734
Isn't that bizarre?

33:47.767 --> 33:49.633
Look at that web.
Crazy.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.734
Normally, when you're
putting new implants in,

33:51.767 --> 33:53.133
you'd remove that web,

33:53.166 --> 33:54.400
but maybe we can use it.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.066
The goal today
with Danielle

33:56.100 --> 33:58.667
is actually the opposite
of what I normally would do

33:58.700 --> 34:00.567
if she wanted to keep
her breast implants.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.433
Instead of discarding
her scar tissue,

34:03.467 --> 34:05.066
I'm actually using it

34:05.100 --> 34:07.734
to increase her fullness
and her volume.

34:07.767 --> 34:10.467
All right, Dr. Mesk,
could you sit her up?

34:14.500 --> 34:16.200
No. That was too aggressive.

34:16.233 --> 34:17.533
[groans]

34:17.567 --> 34:19.400
Gosh, it's so right,

34:19.433 --> 34:21.200
but it's so wrong
at the same time.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.100
I know. I'm wondering
if you can release just--

34:23.133 --> 34:25.100
I know. Let's just
try to release that part.

34:25.133 --> 34:27.400
Clearly this internal
breast lift maneuver

34:27.433 --> 34:28.667
is a little too high.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.033
You kind of have to
figure it out

34:30.066 --> 34:31.133
as you go along.

34:34.233 --> 34:36.233
That might work.
Let's try that.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.133
Well, that's better.
Yes.

34:40.166 --> 34:42.066
What we need now is
we need nature's help.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.700
We need some postoperative
contraction

34:43.734 --> 34:47.734
to help my internal lift
to give me a little oomph.

34:47.767 --> 34:50.533
Let's close.
Let's hope for the best.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.166
Agree?
Agree.

34:55.233 --> 34:56.700
[woman] Hi.
[Dubrow]
How are you?

34:56.734 --> 34:58.767
So you know, I'm scared.
When are you not scared?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.200
So welcome to the world's
most painful patient.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.633
[laughing]

35:02.667 --> 35:05.233
For the least painful
procedure.
Yes.

35:05.266 --> 35:07.100
So you see this.
Mm-hmm.

35:07.133 --> 35:09.433
I'm scarred there
for my skin cancer.
Right.

35:09.467 --> 35:11.633
There's a big
composite graft there.
Right.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.233
Let's do some
microneedling for it.

35:13.266 --> 35:16.133
Microneedling is taking
tens of small needles

35:16.166 --> 35:18.100
that oscillate or go
in and out of your skin

35:18.133 --> 35:19.266
at a very rapid pace.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.600
When you do this,

35:20.633 --> 35:22.567
it stimulates
collagen production,

35:22.600 --> 35:24.467
which makes the appearance of

35:24.500 --> 35:27.633
uneven skin or scars,
irregularities,

35:27.667 --> 35:29.166
get a lot smoother.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.734
All right, I'm starting
to get nervous.

35:30.767 --> 35:32.500
I'm gonna lie you back
down a little bit.

35:32.533 --> 35:33.734
Okay. Otherwise,
I might faint.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.066
Can he hold my hand,
then?

35:35.100 --> 35:38.166
Oh, but seriously.
Okay.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.633
[buzzing]
This is the sound
of the pen, okay?

35:39.667 --> 35:41.767
Oh, God.
I'm gonna get started.

35:44.133 --> 35:46.133
Is there, like,
blood spurting out
everywhere right now?

35:46.166 --> 35:47.266
No.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.066
Did that hurt?
No.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.266
Does this hurt?
No.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.066
[laughing]

35:53.100 --> 35:54.734
Paul is such an easy target,

35:54.767 --> 35:58.033
but even easier when he's
lying in an examination chair.

35:58.066 --> 35:59.633
So you got in the fold?
Yep.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.734
And all around
the entire composite graft,

36:01.767 --> 36:03.533
even on this side.
I wonder if you--

36:03.567 --> 36:06.033
I wonder if you
should just do a--
well, I'm not numb.

36:06.066 --> 36:08.100
You're becoming
a plastic surgery addict.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.700
You know what? We
better get that mirror
out of his hands.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.533
Otherwise,
we'll be here all day.

36:16.266 --> 36:18.233
[Ann Marie] Hi.
[John]
Hey, doc. How are you?

36:18.266 --> 36:19.600
How you doing?

36:19.633 --> 36:20.734
Hi.
How are you?

36:20.767 --> 36:22.233
Hey, how are you?
How are you?

36:22.266 --> 36:24.100
I'm feeling pretty good.
I've got some pain,

36:24.133 --> 36:27.333
but, when I look at
my breasts wrapped up,

36:27.367 --> 36:29.633
they look like they're
the right size.

36:29.667 --> 36:32.633
So I'm super-duper hopeful.

36:32.667 --> 36:34.233
I want to see
what the breasts look like

36:34.266 --> 36:36.100
in terms of the skin
because

36:36.133 --> 36:38.066
I don't want a disaster.

36:39.367 --> 36:40.700
No, they're good.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.233
Are we still worried?

36:44.266 --> 36:45.567
That skin looks beautiful.
No.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.600
Well, we have to look
at this side.

36:47.633 --> 36:49.100
Yeah, and that's just--

36:49.133 --> 36:50.667
Yeah.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.066
When I look down,

36:52.100 --> 36:54.100
I see this awesome cleavage.

36:54.133 --> 36:56.033
It just looks so beautiful.

36:56.066 --> 36:59.133
And I couldn't have asked
for anything better.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.100
He definitely gets an A
in my book.

37:01.133 --> 37:03.133
So now she no
longer has nipples.

37:03.166 --> 37:05.767
Right. Okay.
So those nipples you had,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.166
let's face it. That's not
state of the art nipples.
They were so bad.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.533
Okay? We have a tattoo
specialist

37:10.567 --> 37:12.233
who is gonna
make you nipple tattoos

37:12.266 --> 37:15.333
that look better
than natural ones.

37:15.367 --> 37:19.000
So far, Ann Marie has a good
early postoperative result.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.133
I have to make sure

37:20.166 --> 37:22.166
that she continues to heal,

37:22.200 --> 37:23.533
that the breast
continues to take shape.

37:23.567 --> 37:24.734
Then she's gonna go on

37:24.767 --> 37:26.133
to get a nipple tattoo,

37:26.166 --> 37:27.266
the final stage

37:27.300 --> 37:29.033
of her breast reconstruction.

37:29.066 --> 37:31.400
I promised John
I would never get
another tattoo.

37:31.433 --> 37:33.233
You're getting this one.
[Ann Marie laughing]

37:33.266 --> 37:36.100
Nuhh.

37:36.133 --> 37:38.133
[Dubrow]
So let's see
what it looks like.

37:38.166 --> 37:41.266
Seeing my breasts
without the implants

37:41.300 --> 37:43.000
is shocking.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.233
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
[knock on door]
[Danielle] Hi.

37:52.433 --> 37:53.433
[Nassif]
Hello. How you feeling?

37:53.467 --> 37:55.100
I'm nervous to see them.

37:55.133 --> 37:57.100
Yeah.
I'm almost wondering

37:57.133 --> 37:58.700
if I shouldn't see them.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.100
Let me see them,
and I'll tell you.

38:00.133 --> 38:01.266
Okay. [laughing]

38:01.300 --> 38:03.233
I am 24 hours out of surgery,

38:03.266 --> 38:04.333
and I have no idea

38:04.367 --> 38:05.700
what to expect

38:05.734 --> 38:07.467
because I did not get
a replacement implant.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.367
So am I deflated?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.700
Am I symmetrical?

38:11.734 --> 38:14.400
I want to know,
but I'm frightened to see.

38:14.433 --> 38:16.333
So let's see
what it looks like.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.200
Look at that.
Is that great?

38:22.233 --> 38:23.467
See how I got them lifted up

38:23.500 --> 38:25.367
right into a B cup position?

38:25.400 --> 38:27.000
I'm still afraid to look.

38:27.033 --> 38:28.400
You don't want to look down.
Should I look?

38:28.433 --> 38:30.166
They'll definitely
look better than this,

38:30.200 --> 38:32.367
but I'm a little surprised
they look this good.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.467
Hmm.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.400
Seeing my breasts
without the implants

38:38.433 --> 38:40.266
is shocking.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.133
I've been living
for ten years

38:42.166 --> 38:45.667
with these huge boulders
on my collarbone.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.400
And now they're gone.

38:47.433 --> 38:49.166
It's a lot to take in.
[Dubrow] Right.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.734
It's a traumatic change, but--

38:50.767 --> 38:52.433
But have you--
I expected--

38:52.467 --> 38:54.000
Worse.
...something very scary.

38:54.033 --> 38:55.133
Yeah,
and they're not scary.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.300
They're not scary at all.
Uh-huh.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.367
I think you're gonna be
pleasantly surprised,

38:59.400 --> 39:01.433
in as little
as two to three weeks,

39:01.467 --> 39:03.467
how much more oomph you get

39:03.500 --> 39:07.133
as you shrink and retract
upwards.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.433
So let's just be patient.
Mm-hmm.

39:09.467 --> 39:11.500
And let's see
where you end up, okay?

39:11.533 --> 39:12.734
Okay.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.734
When the implants
were first removed,

39:19.767 --> 39:22.100
it wasn't as easy as I
thought it was gonna be.

39:22.133 --> 39:25.333
It took a while
to get used to it,

39:25.367 --> 39:28.734
but, now that I've got
my natural body back,

39:28.767 --> 39:33.133
I feel healthy and alive.

39:33.166 --> 39:35.000
This is just
exciting for me

39:35.033 --> 39:36.467
to finally see her
at peace

39:36.500 --> 39:38.467
and--
Comfortable.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.367
Comfortable. Now she's
gonna finally be free of it.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.166
I'm excited that Danielle
has her implants out.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.300
It's made my wife
a happier person,

39:46.333 --> 39:48.467
and now she can move on
with her life.

39:48.500 --> 39:52.066
Oh, my God!
Look at her!

39:52.100 --> 39:54.467
Beautiful, babe.
Beautiful!

39:54.500 --> 39:57.066
Danielle looks amazing.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.333
I couldn't even imagine

39:58.367 --> 40:00.233
that she was gonna look
that awesome.

40:00.266 --> 40:04.000
I have a room full
of the most important
people to me right now.

40:04.033 --> 40:05.266
I'm so happy for you.
[Danielle]
I love you.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.166
I love you, too.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.200
Before my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

40:09.233 --> 40:11.533
I had scar tissue
pushing my implants up,

40:11.567 --> 40:14.367
and I couldn't enjoy my life
the way I wanted to.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.033
Now that my implants
have been removed,

40:17.066 --> 40:18.300
I can think clearly.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.600
I have this natural energy

40:19.633 --> 40:21.200
from getting great rest.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.066
I am a brand-new me.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.567
Well, the doctors
did a great job.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.033
Let's cheer to them.

40:26.066 --> 40:27.233
Let's do it.

40:27.266 --> 40:29.467
Cheers to Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.533
[whooping]

40:30.567 --> 40:32.600
Cheer, doctors.
Thank you.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.533
So this is Jason.

40:40.567 --> 40:42.433
This is the man. Okay?

40:42.467 --> 40:45.100
He does all my areola
tattooing.

40:45.133 --> 40:46.266
He's kind of a genius
about it.

40:46.300 --> 40:47.300
[chuckling]
He really is.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.533
Now's the time

40:48.567 --> 40:50.567
to make the final
finishing touches

40:50.600 --> 40:53.166
on things, right?
So I'm excited.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.500
[Ann Marie]
Today is the final step.

40:55.533 --> 40:58.266
I'm not letting breast cancer
hold me down anymore.

40:58.300 --> 41:01.066
These symbolize
what I've gone through

41:01.100 --> 41:03.100
and how much better I am

41:03.133 --> 41:06.300
for the experience
of having cancer

41:06.333 --> 41:08.133
and defeating it.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.533
Cancer sucks,

41:09.567 --> 41:12.333
and I'm moving past it.

41:12.367 --> 41:14.200
Dude, those look really good.

41:14.233 --> 41:17.166
Yeah, somebody
in the room's a genius.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.100
Jason.
That's what I'm thinking.

41:19.133 --> 41:20.600
Oh, you mean me?
Yeah.

41:20.633 --> 41:22.166
I'm sorry. What?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
[laughter]

41:23.233 --> 41:25.066
I didn't hear you.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.266
If I had a nickel for every
time I was called a genius,

41:28.300 --> 41:29.600
I could afford my wife.

41:31.567 --> 41:33.633
All right,
so you ready for this?
Yes.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.266
Let's do it.
Okay.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.533
Ann Marie's had
one hell of a journey,
and I'm thrilled

41:38.567 --> 41:41.100
that we've gotten
to this final stage

41:41.133 --> 41:42.200
of her reconstruction.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.367
I'm just hoping

41:43.400 --> 41:45.200
this is the final chapter

41:45.233 --> 41:47.433
to getting her
where she needs to be

41:47.467 --> 41:49.433
to feel whole again.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.066
Do you want to see them?
Yeah.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.300
All right, so why
don't you take a look

41:52.333 --> 41:53.500
and see what you think?

41:56.333 --> 41:57.367
Thank you.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.066
[sniffling]
It's--

42:01.667 --> 42:04.433
Isn't that great?
It looks so real.

42:04.467 --> 42:06.533
I know. Doesn't it?

42:06.567 --> 42:08.166
Before my surgery,

42:08.200 --> 42:10.066
my body was torn up
by necrosis,

42:10.100 --> 42:11.533
and I looked
like Frankenstein,

42:11.567 --> 42:14.300
and my nipples were
sewn on like patchwork.

42:14.333 --> 42:15.600
I couldn't
look in the mirror,

42:15.633 --> 42:17.300
let alone let my husband
look at me.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.633
But now after surgery,

42:18.667 --> 42:20.400
I no longer look
like a monster.

42:20.433 --> 42:22.233
Those scars are gone.

42:22.266 --> 42:23.567
I'm happy at what I see,

42:23.600 --> 42:26.200
and I don't mind if John
catches a peek, either.

42:26.233 --> 42:27.700
Looks awesome.
[laughs]

42:27.734 --> 42:30.367
[Dubrow, Jason laugh]
Looks awesome.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.467
I'm happy.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.133
The smile she has now

42:33.166 --> 42:35.433
reminds me of the
pre-cancer surgery smile.

42:35.467 --> 42:37.333
I can't wait to see it
every single day now.

42:37.367 --> 42:42.400
I don't know what I did
right in my life

42:42.433 --> 42:46.166
to be lucky enough
to have this opportunity,

42:46.200 --> 42:47.400
honestly.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.400
This experience has shown me

42:49.433 --> 42:53.633
that, no matter what type
of hell I'm gonna go through,

42:53.667 --> 42:56.600
I'm gonna claw my way out
and come out on top,

42:56.633 --> 42:58.667
no matter what, and I know

42:58.700 --> 43:00.467
I'll be happy. I'll be whole.

43:00.500 --> 43:03.500
And you, holy smokes.
Huh? Huh?

43:03.533 --> 43:04.734
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.

43:04.767 --> 43:06.633
You've come a long way,
you know?

43:06.667 --> 43:09.367
A long way.
Thanks to you.

43:10.734 --> 43:12.367
[man]
I'm about to see the doctors

43:12.400 --> 43:14.300
to show off
my new luscious lips.

43:14.333 --> 43:15.500
Would you try
to take me home?

43:15.533 --> 43:17.500
Nah. I'm-- I'm not--
You would.

43:17.533 --> 43:19.400
He's staring at me
across the table.

43:19.433 --> 43:21.433
[laughing]

43:21.467 --> 43:23.367
There's a glass tube
right there.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.667
Careful, or stuff
will squirt out.

43:25.767 --> 43:27.633
That's a new one.

43:27.667 --> 43:30.233
You have that areola
of the nipple--

43:30.266 --> 43:31.667
Yeah.
...that's way over.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.633
It's basically
just in my armpit.

43:33.667 --> 43:36.500
This has a greater risk
for tissue breakdown.

43:36.533 --> 43:39.367
What good is a nipple
with a dead breast.
