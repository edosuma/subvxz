WEBVTT

00:09.573 --> 00:10.658
Unbelievable.

00:17.627 --> 00:19.747
- Hello? 
- There are no empty tables at Luke's.

00:19.792 --> 00:21.355
And I can do what about that?

00:21.416 --> 00:24.380
Well, I was hoping you'd develop mind control powers since I last saw you

00:24.436 --> 00:26.546
- and you could will people to leave. 
- No. If I could do that,

00:26.587 --> 00:29.844
I'd be using it to play the ponies or something. Your table would be low on the list.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.774
Selfish! Ooh, hold on a sec.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.903
- Kirk, may I? 
- May you what?

00:34.945 --> 00:35.916
- Sit with you? 
- Here?

00:35.967 --> 00:37.421
- Yes. 
- I have a girlfriend.

00:37.534 --> 00:40.227
- I'm not flirting with you Kirk. 
- Oh. Then, have a seat.

00:40.293 --> 00:41.062
Thanks.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.621
- I love that shirt. 
- It's an Arnold Palmer.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.899
- That was flirting. 
- Oh, man.

00:47.369 --> 00:50.586
- I'm back. So, what's going on with Lane? 
- She's here. She's fine.

00:50.631 --> 00:55.571
She's still a little bit in denial. She hasn't talked to her mom since the kick-out.

00:55.604 --> 00:57.123
- Poor Mrs. Kim. 
- Poor Mrs. Kim?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.805
- She kicked Lane out, I'm mad at her. 
- Why? She must be very lonely without Lane.

01:00.841 --> 01:05.444
Well, Lane's getting along pretty well here. She kind of fallen into a - rhythm.

01:05.489 --> 01:06.904
- Hey. 
- Hey, Take.

01:07.169 --> 01:09.013
Thanks you. Hey, you're out of breath.

01:09.114 --> 01:12.806
There were incredibly slow people in the coffee line, and I promised to wake Paris.

01:13.456 --> 01:15.443
- Up and at 'em! 
- Die.

01:15.497 --> 01:18.850
I got you a triple espresso that I'm going to put here right out of reach,

01:18.896 --> 01:22.024
- so sleepyhead has to get up to get it. 
- Die twice.

01:22.085 --> 01:23.425
Was she at the professor's again last night?

01:23.523 --> 01:26.108
Yes, but she claims she was up all night cramming.

01:26.181 --> 01:29.288
- Well, she was. 
- Oh, ick!

01:29.386 --> 01:31.900
Ick what? Are you talking about me? Who is that?

01:32.013 --> 01:34.379
It's my mom. We're not talking about you. You're so paranoid.

01:34.449 --> 01:36.129
Uh, hold on a sec. Luke's here.

01:36.426 --> 01:40.030
I swear, it feels like these stupid Firelight Festivals happen every week.

01:40.071 --> 01:42.339
- And a happy, happy to you too. 
- Order please.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.067
- Coffee and whatever muffin you have. 
- Comin' up.

01:44.295 --> 01:46.666
- You two an item now? 
- I have a girlfriend.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.858
Double dipping, you dog.

01:48.986 --> 01:50.982
You never told me why you're up so early.

01:51.018 --> 01:54.410
Well, I've got a quick meeting at the Dragonfly, and then Jason is coming here for the day.

01:54.494 --> 01:56.097
- Jason? 
- He's taking the morning off,

01:56.152 --> 01:58.815
so I'm taking him shopping for new furniture for his office.

01:58.867 --> 02:02.897
- Sounds fun. 
- Yeah. He's never really seen Stars Hollow, so I...

02:03.162 --> 02:06.327
- get to - show him around, right? 
- Hm. Um-hm.

02:06.368 --> 02:07.627
- Did I interrupt something? 
- No.

02:07.668 --> 02:11.298
Would my reminding you of the cell phone policy affect your behavior in anyway?

02:11.329 --> 02:13.194
- It's Rory. 
- Hello Rory!

02:13.331 --> 02:16.044
- How does it feel to be a step-dad? 
- Knock it off.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.651
- Gooood thinking. 
- What?

02:18.701 --> 02:22.195
Clamming up. He's always had a problem with your guys. Best to ease into it.

02:22.236 --> 02:24.084
Oh. No, no that's not why I stopped talking.

02:24.129 --> 02:27.647
Whoo, whoo! Good Morning Vietnam!

02:27.703 --> 02:28.727
- What was that? 
- Paris.

02:28.825 --> 02:31.512
She likes to do this thing in the morning with the triple espresso.

02:31.620 --> 02:34.743
- It's like Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider. 
- Jumping Cattle Hockey!

02:34.947 --> 02:36.683
Hey Paris, can you take this somewhere else, please?

02:36.806 --> 02:39.597
Ahh, wait, wait, wait. We got a little something else goin' on here --

02:39.653 --> 02:40.620
What's going on?

02:41.327 --> 02:45.127
A kinda odd rock-and-roll, hippy-chick came in, she's deep in conversation with Luke,

02:45.193 --> 02:47.646
- who is not looking too happy...
- What are they saying?

02:47.717 --> 02:49.473
They are rudely out of range.

02:49.913 --> 02:53.815
Hey hun, hun? Try to move in so you can hear 'em. Go

02:54.061 --> 02:56.590
She's joking. We're just friends, ha-ha.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.089
- A mystery woman! 
- Maybe she has something to do with his apartment?

02:59.135 --> 03:03.445
I mean he might be leasing out whichever one he's not using, or it's about his divorce with Nicole

03:03.482 --> 03:06.446
or the lack of one if the divorce is definitely off.

03:06.487 --> 03:11.284
Or maybe she's a friend of Nicole's or another attorney if it's not definitely off.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.633
Wait, Luke is the most complicated guy I know who also owns a Doobie Brothers record.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.036
- Sweet Mamma Jamma! 
- Oh! I've gotta wake Tanna.

03:17.229 --> 03:18.776
Wait, wait… denoument!

03:21.254 --> 03:23.542
- He sent her upstairs! 
- Weird!

03:23.645 --> 03:26.706
So what do you think? An early morning tryst with the county dominatrix?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.374
- Hmm, does she have a bag? 
- No.

03:29.436 --> 03:31.243
Then where would all her dominatrix stuff be?

03:31.324 --> 03:33.332
Oh, maybe they're using all the stuff he keeps on hand?

03:33.394 --> 03:35.099
- Fishing pole? 
- Nolan Ryan's rookie card?

03:35.170 --> 03:36.762
- Mystery! 
- Mystery!

03:36.850 --> 03:38.288
- Go ask him! 
- Who's yer daddy!

03:38.365 --> 03:40.448
- He's in back. 
- So go back there and ask him!

03:40.475 --> 03:41.975
- I have to know what's going on. 
- Okay.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.750
Aww, crap, crap crap!

03:43.930 --> 03:46.230
Oh, maybe later, I don't think now is such a good time.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.712
- I'll talk to you later. 
- Later.

03:56.700 --> 03:57.730
I have a girlfriend!

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:55.668 --> 04:57.173
Okay, open your eyes.

04:58.616 --> 05:01.033
Wow! I'm stunning.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.408
- Your stylist concurs. 
- Wow, so organized out here.

05:03.593 --> 05:05.936
- I tidied up a little. Excess stuff went into the cabinet. 
- Impressive.

05:06.288 --> 05:07.393
I'll get it.

05:08.147 --> 05:10.767
- How good do I look? 
- Would a comedic reply crush you?

05:11.509 --> 05:13.116
- Probably. 
- Terrif.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.847
- Where's the phone? 
- Buried somewhere.

05:15.098 --> 05:17.773
- Tanna's gonna knock boys out today. 
- With what? Sheer peculiarity?

05:17.814 --> 05:20.786
I am hoping that one boy notices. Chester Fleet.

05:20.827 --> 05:21.700
Chester Fleet?

05:21.771 --> 05:25.482
His father was instrumental in conducting research showing that neurons in the brain fire

05:25.518 --> 05:28.774
actively during REM sleep - with the exception of nerve cells involved

05:28.831 --> 05:31.697
with the transmitter chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine.

05:31.743 --> 05:35.558
I'd forgot the first part of that sentence by the time you finished, but I say jump him.

05:36.162 --> 05:38.590
Thanks Lane. See ya later.

05:38.999 --> 05:40.012
Finally.

05:40.489 --> 05:42.911
- Hello? 
- Hi Rory, its Jamie. How you doin'?

05:43.008 --> 05:46.305
Good Jamie. It's been a while. How's the second best school in the country?

05:46.361 --> 05:49.525
Princeton's fine. Hard, not as easy as slacker schools like Yale.

05:49.571 --> 05:50.785
I'm assuming you're looking for Paris?

05:50.836 --> 05:53.812
Yeah. I'm actually in town for a couple of days, so I'll probably see you at some point.

05:53.878 --> 05:54.692
Great. Here she is.

05:55.075 --> 05:56.930
Hey, I was just stepping out the door, what's up?

05:57.503 --> 05:58.128
Fine.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.186
Your hotel room's good?

06:01.104 --> 06:01.775
Good.

06:02.905 --> 06:06.535
Well, probably not tonight, unfortunately. Things are really bad on my end.

06:07.836 --> 06:11.696
I know, I'm so sorry but tonight was tentative, remember? Tonight wasn't set in stone.

06:12.941 --> 06:16.647
Well, I'm - dead tired, I have tons of studying to do

06:16.698 --> 06:18.931
and we have a little drama going on here at the suite.

06:19.269 --> 06:21.926
Rory's small town friend, Lane, is crashing in with us.

06:22.003 --> 06:24.773
She got kicked out of her house, and she's in pretty bad shape.

06:24.979 --> 06:28.197
She's pretty heavy into the drugs, totally Nancy Spungening it,

06:28.505 --> 06:31.050
chasing the dragon, and I kind of have to be here for support.

06:31.132 --> 06:32.401
The chick's bouncing off the walls.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.134
Yeah. Tomorrow, sure, absolutely.

06:36.872 --> 06:39.912
Tonight was tentative, Jamie, I'm sure I told you to pencil it in.

06:40.035 --> 06:42.268
Pencil. Okay, bye.

06:44.608 --> 06:45.975
- What? 
- Nothing.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.738
I had to say something like that. He doesn't always respond to the fact

06:48.771 --> 06:50.633
that I have to study, which I do, you know that.

06:50.695 --> 06:52.150
- Oh, sure. 
- And I'm seeing him tomorrow anyway.

06:52.201 --> 06:54.156
- What's "chasing the dragon?" 
- I've gotta go

06:54.417 --> 06:56.204
But I don't think you should be saying that...

07:01.857 --> 07:03.210
Hey, take it easy!

07:42.982 --> 07:47.032
Gentleman, gentlemen. There is no way to one hundred percent avoid liability

07:47.088 --> 07:49.264
for on-site accidents at any of your plants.

07:49.310 --> 07:51.757
It is unfortunate, but international accords preclude it.

07:52.147 --> 07:54.742
- Can you please translate Mr. Watanabi? 
- Okay.

07:57.671 --> 07:59.811
- I'm sorry. 
- What happed to taking the morning off?

07:59.867 --> 08:04.061
I have the morning off. Japan does not have the morning off. Here.

08:04.143 --> 08:06.339
- Care to join me? 
- With all those Japanese business men in the car? Kinky.

08:06.396 --> 08:09.959
Kinky? I'm sorry, what is kinky?

08:10.128 --> 08:13.769
You don't have to translate that, Mr. Watanabi. Where are we?

08:13.834 --> 08:16.616
- They must confer. 
- Oh, they really dig conferring.

08:17.194 --> 08:20.317
Please tell them that I will call them again tomorrow.

08:20.466 --> 08:23.118
Minna-san domo arigato. Gozaimasu.

08:27.205 --> 08:29.277
Here come on, get in here. It's cold out side.

08:29.396 --> 08:30.968
I thought we'd take my Jeep. It holds more stuff.

08:31.121 --> 08:31.894
That's good thinking.

08:36.192 --> 08:37.143
- Hello. 
- Hello.

08:37.932 --> 08:40.850
- So, where are we off today? 
- Well, I've got a fabulous little list here.

08:40.899 --> 08:43.763
Lots of places in neighboring Woodbury and we'll have to get a newspaper.

08:43.962 --> 08:45.324
- For...
- ... finding dead people.

08:45.514 --> 08:46.865
Ah, estate sales, got it.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.563
Then we can come back, hit a few places here and then grab some lunch.

08:49.619 --> 08:51.935
Do we have time for coffee now? I haven't had any for hours.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.521
- For hours? When did you get up? 
- Five.

08:53.604 --> 08:55.850
Wow, they have one of those in the morning too?

08:55.943 --> 08:58.615
You know how Asia is not taking the morning off? Neither is Europe.

08:58.682 --> 08:59.627
Well, coffee, it is then.

08:59.695 --> 09:02.199
How about you taking me to that place you're always talking about. What is it, um -

09:02.256 --> 09:04.678
- Duke's. 
- Duke's. Sure.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.403
Or, uh, we could go some place else.

09:06.495 --> 09:08.293
- Why? Why not Duke's? 
- It's not so special.

09:08.364 --> 09:09.327
You go there daily.

09:09.427 --> 09:12.021
Yeah, but I think Duke's is closed… and it's Luke's.

09:12.239 --> 09:14.257
Closed at eight in the morning on a Friday?

09:14.451 --> 09:16.238
- Yeah. Sabbath. 
- Duke's a Jew.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.774
- No, Luke's a Jew. 
- Sabbath's not 'til sundown.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.749
Well, he likes to get an early jump on his - Sabbathing.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.033
I bet he's open.

09:23.115 --> 09:26.243
Okay, but we run the risk of going and then discovering it's closed.

09:26.321 --> 09:27.984
Well, I say live dangerously or not at all.

09:28.051 --> 09:29.731
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

09:30.309 --> 09:34.523
All the other coffee in town sucks. Let's just go to Duke's - which is Luke's.

09:34.559 --> 09:35.705
- Which is Luke's? 
- Dukes.

09:36.361 --> 09:36.915
What?

09:37.887 --> 09:41.804
No, no Rietgaard, those documents were Fed-Ex'd to you on Wednesday.

09:42.270 --> 09:48.808
The dok-umen-ten were Fed-Ex'd, on

09:49.038 --> 09:52.074
aw, shoot, on… Monday is maandag, Tuesday is dinsdag…

09:52.148 --> 09:54.773
- How's your Dutch? 
- Oh great. I just don't like to share it.

09:54.834 --> 09:58.894
I'll just have the office fax it all over to you today. It's okay.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.408
Hey, is he ice-skating under a windmill, that's the picture I have in my head.

10:01.532 --> 10:03.897
Okay, Rietgaard, good bye. Bye.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.052
I am exhausted.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.624
Aww, and on your morning off!

10:07.716 --> 10:09.522
Yeah, I stink at taking mornings off.

10:09.672 --> 10:11.301
Well, here we are.

10:11.413 --> 10:12.456
Ahh, wait.

10:13.348 --> 10:14.239
No more calls.

10:14.685 --> 10:16.103
Whose truck is that?

10:16.230 --> 10:17.849
- Duke's? 
- Yeah, Luke's.

10:17.905 --> 10:19.288
- Are they different people? 
- Same person.

10:19.363 --> 10:21.679
- And that's his truck. 
- Yes, it's practically an appendage.

10:21.878 --> 10:24.213
So, that would be Luke.

10:24.306 --> 10:26.614
Boy, you sure like to do a lot of research before getting a cup of coffee.

10:26.762 --> 10:28.969
That's the doorknob. It twists to the right. C'mon.

10:29.015 --> 10:30.772
- Ahhh...
- What is with you?

10:30.870 --> 10:32.769
Yeah, I'm not in the mood for coffee anymore.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.611
You were jonesing not 5 minutes ago.

10:34.715 --> 10:37.388
No, it's passed. My 5 a.m. coffee just kicked in again.

10:37.474 --> 10:39.389
- You drink time-released coffee? 
- It's all the rage.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.552
- Okay. Well, I want coffee. 
- Okay, I'll wait for you here.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.014
What is with you?

10:43.485 --> 10:46.864
I was kind of tailgating Duke on the drive in.

10:46.971 --> 10:48.420
You were tailgating Luke?

10:48.631 --> 10:51.042
- Pretty rudely. There was honking. 
- Aw, geez.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.459
- Well, I didn't know it was Duke. 
- How fast was he going?

10:53.598 --> 10:54.887
Snail's speed. Like twenty.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.496
The speed limit here is twelve!

10:56.602 --> 10:58.988
Okay See this is one of the problems I have with small towns - proximity.

10:59.044 --> 11:01.329
You tailgate a guy in Manhattan and you never see him again,

11:01.395 --> 11:04.128
you tailgate a guy in a small town, he is the keeper of the coffee.

11:04.661 --> 11:06.808
- And he is looking at us! 
- Who Luke?

11:06.879 --> 11:07.759
- Is that his name? 
- YES!

11:07.816 --> 11:10.556
- Okay, don't look at him! Don't look at him! 
- This is ridiculous!

11:10.606 --> 11:12.158
- Okay go, go, go! 
- Where?!

11:12.315 --> 11:15.722
- Anywhere - else - for coffee, please. 
- Okay.

11:17.419 --> 11:18.238
Why are we stopping?

11:18.491 --> 11:20.698
Um, the next best place for coffee is at this place.

11:20.815 --> 11:23.744
Okay Please find us coffee at least fifty yards away from Duke's.

11:23.836 --> 11:27.584
Oh, oh okay finding coffee fifty yards from Luke's is another matter.

11:30.052 --> 11:32.055
- Hey Rory. 
- Oh, Jamie, hi.

11:32.187 --> 11:33.595
Sorry to pounce on you like that.

11:33.697 --> 11:35.230
That's okay, you're not pouncing. Wanna sit?

11:35.406 --> 11:36.350
Thanks.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.389
Listen, do you - ?

11:42.059 --> 11:42.877
Do I what?

11:43.154 --> 11:47.056
Look, I need to find out what's up with Paris, and I don't know who else to ask.

11:47.394 --> 11:51.377
I mean, I had to rearrange a million things to come here, and I could only manage two days

11:51.454 --> 11:52.462
and she won't see me.

11:52.743 --> 11:54.566
Well, you're going to see her tomorrow, aren't you?

11:54.648 --> 11:56.637
- If she doesn't cancel. 
- She's not going to cancel.

11:57.607 --> 12:00.075
- She wouldn't. 
- Well, she's been canceling plans for weeks.

12:00.158 --> 12:02.688
She's not calling me as much - I know, I sound pathetic.

12:02.815 --> 12:04.807
No you don't, and Paris has been so busy.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.947
You've been a freshman in college, you know what that entails.

12:07.188 --> 12:07.843
Yeah.

12:08.498 --> 12:10.931
Plus, I heard her telling you about my friend, Lane.

12:11.059 --> 12:14.796
She's been living in our suite and it's been really unfair to all my roommates.

12:14.903 --> 12:16.116
What is "chasing the dragon?"

12:16.208 --> 12:18.230
I don't know, but that's what Lane says she's been doing.

12:18.410 --> 12:21.427
She's in cold turkey now - going it,

12:21.663 --> 12:26.653
I mean - cold turkey and -- Paris has been really great helping out.

12:26.987 --> 12:28.391
Has she been seeing someone else?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.248
Not that I know of.

12:31.210 --> 12:35.275
I'll let you go. Thanks, this actually helped.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.480
Good. It will get better, Jamie. I really think that.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.203
Good.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.099
It's my birthday.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.516
Oh wow, happy birthday.

12:45.782 --> 12:46.393
Thanks.

12:53.003 --> 12:53.744
Thanks.

13:02.019 --> 13:03.426
- Hey! 
- Oh yeah.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.836
- You forget about me? 
- No, I'm just real, real busy, that's all.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.646
- Looks like a lull to me. 
- No, it can be deceptive.

13:10.066 --> 13:12.063
Hey, Kirk, you want another piece of pie?

13:12.140 --> 13:13.103
No, I'm fine.

13:13.666 --> 13:16.559
And this is the commencement of your classic mid-morning lull.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.535
People off to work, kids off to school.

13:18.746 --> 13:21.074
You may not have another soul in here for half an hour.

13:21.326 --> 13:24.721
It gets peaceful, quiet - kind of like a sweet death.

13:24.966 --> 13:26.006
He's trippy.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.598
Kirk, are you sure you don't want anything else?

13:27.675 --> 13:30.378
A spider monkey, but there is probably nothing you can do about it.

13:30.460 --> 13:31.499
Cool. C'mon.

13:32.785 --> 13:33.741
Coming sis.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.526
Liz?

13:41.177 --> 13:41.897
Liz?

13:42.088 --> 13:43.306
I'm in the closet.

13:44.688 --> 13:47.929
Oh my God. It's still here.

13:47.985 --> 13:49.722
- What's still there? 
- My pot.

13:49.875 --> 13:50.653
Your what?

13:50.817 --> 13:53.880
I used to stash it in a hole back behind Daddy's files

13:53.945 --> 13:56.967
cause it was the one place he wouldn't look. Isn't that wild? It's still here.

13:57.018 --> 14:00.762
- Will you give me that. 
- Relax, will ya. I don't do that any more.

14:00.935 --> 14:03.167
- What are you doing? 
- I'm putting it away.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.153
- Throw it in the trash. 
- So the garbage man can see it?

14:05.215 --> 14:07.441
- Isn't Hayward Donnelly still the garbage man? 
- Yes.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.790
- Well hell, he sold it to me. 
- I'll get rid of it, okay Liz?

14:10.868 --> 14:11.846
Okay, Luke.

14:14.190 --> 14:15.787
Boy, you look good.

14:17.335 --> 14:18.589
What about me, don't I look good?

14:18.818 --> 14:19.566
You look fine.

14:19.627 --> 14:23.104
I do not look fine, I look good. I am good. I am really good, Luke.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.113
Well, I'm glad.

14:24.425 --> 14:27.293
- I made us some coffee. 
- I don't drink coffee.

14:27.349 --> 14:31.490
Well, sit down and watch me drink it then. Come on, just for a minute.

14:34.635 --> 14:37.988
Look at us - catching up, and all.

14:41.950 --> 14:44.004
- I haven't seen you in two years. 
- Three years.

14:44.061 --> 14:47.371
- Three years, wow. 
- Liz, I gotta know why you're here.

14:47.435 --> 14:48.894
- To see you, I've missed you. 
- C'mon.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.273
I did, plus it's my twentieth high school reunion this Saturday,

14:52.335 --> 14:55.919
I thought I'd maybe come back and I'd check out what the rest of the class of 84's up to.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.026
- You're going to your high school reunion? 
- I even sent in a picture for the program.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.380
Wrote a little thing about myself, about how things are going good,

15:02.570 --> 15:07.224
I've got a great job, I've just moved into a really cool apartment with a big patio

15:07.286 --> 15:10.547
so I can finally get a dog. Plus, I have got -

15:10.598 --> 15:13.302
Wait, wait, wait - let me guess. A new, a new boyfriend!

15:13.372 --> 15:13.931
Yes!

15:14.027 --> 15:16.599
And this one - Oh, let me guess - is different from the others.

15:16.685 --> 15:17.402
Yes, he is.

15:17.454 --> 15:19.091
- I dare say, that he might even be the one! 
- Well, yeah!

15:19.722 --> 15:21.908
- C'mon, Liz. 
- You should meet him.

15:21.965 --> 15:26.992
Well you know what? As long as, unlike the others, he leaves your TV when he takes off, I'll love him.

15:27.564 --> 15:30.750
Okay, fine. You have good reason to think, to doubt -

15:30.801 --> 15:35.383
Good reasons? Liz, every time you find the one you wind up with your bank account cleaned out,

15:35.471 --> 15:39.122
your stuff missing, crying on the phone to me to bail you out,

15:39.178 --> 15:45.619
which I do happily, but you'll understand if I hold off on planning for the bachelor party for a while.

15:46.699 --> 15:47.355
Sure.

15:48.968 --> 15:53.442
Well - anyway - let's talk about something else.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.867
Yes. Let's talk about something else. You said you had a new job.

15:56.935 --> 16:00.129
Yes, I do. I do. I'm making my own jewelry:

16:00.252 --> 16:04.353
beaded necklaces and earrings, some crystal, getting into feathers now.

16:04.462 --> 16:04.962
Feathers?

16:05.061 --> 16:07.988
I'm really good, very big on the renaissance fair circuit.

16:08.045 --> 16:08.588
What's that?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.185
That's where I sell them, the renaissance fair circuit. It's a total trip.

16:11.260 --> 16:16.861
I wear the long skirt, I have a hat and one of those corsets that squishes my boobs all up high.

16:17.113 --> 16:20.794
- And I yell "Huzza for the tipper!" 
- And that's your great new job?

16:20.891 --> 16:24.767
- You sell earrings at the renaissance fair? 
- I know it sounds flaky -

16:24.906 --> 16:28.008
Oh no, what - huzzah for the tipper with your squished up boobs, not flaky at all.

16:28.069 --> 16:31.065
- Look, I have to go back to work. 
- Luke, come on.

16:31.131 --> 16:34.598
What come on, Liz? I mean, you're selling earrings in a booth

16:34.680 --> 16:36.818
- and you're hooked up with another winner. 
- You don't even know him.

16:36.906 --> 16:39.587
What about your son, huh? What about Jess, you talk to him lately?

16:39.661 --> 16:43.332
- You notice he's not even here? 
- Yeah, he sent me a letter. He's with his father.

16:43.398 --> 16:44.899
That's it? That's the extent of the contact?

16:44.980 --> 16:47.551
He's nineteen, you can't tell him anything.

16:47.623 --> 16:49.936
- Well, you definitely can't if you don't try. 
- I tried.

16:50.019 --> 16:51.314
No, I tried, you gave up.

16:51.392 --> 16:53.675
I thought you'd be better for him that I was.

16:53.752 --> 16:55.353
Oh yeah, I was great for him.

16:55.416 --> 16:58.487
I gave him a place to crash while he lied to me about everything,

16:58.564 --> 17:01.370
about going to school, about Wal-Mart - you know I stole his car?

17:01.436 --> 17:02.526
- You what? 
- In the middle of the night.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.690
I break into his car. I'm stealing it and hiding it in Dad's old garage.

17:05.799 --> 17:07.380
- Why? 
- Why? Because I'm crazy.

17:07.441 --> 17:12.132
Because I think now he'll have to go to school, now he'll have to graduate, now -

17:15.477 --> 17:19.571
well, we saw how that all turned out, he went to live with the bum who abandoned him -

17:19.644 --> 17:21.481
that's how great a job I did.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.041
You tried.

17:27.258 --> 17:28.561
Well, I'm great at trying aren't I?

17:31.809 --> 17:34.975
Well, I know you have a lot of work to do, so I'm gonna go.

17:38.664 --> 17:39.510
Where you staying?

17:39.704 --> 17:40.733
With Carrie Duncan.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.151
Crazy Carrie Duncan?

17:42.248 --> 17:45.120
- She's not crazy, she just likes the boys. 
- I'll say.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.275
You should talk. You made out with her at the homecoming game.

17:48.327 --> 17:54.747
I did not. I didn't not make out with Crazy Carrie Duncan at the homecoming game.

17:55.105 --> 17:56.339
It was really good to see you.

17:57.122 --> 17:58.279
And you do look good.

17:59.482 --> 18:02.247
I will make sure Carrie knows that.

18:15.804 --> 18:20.517
Wait, wait, wait, wait the tracking says its in Atlanta. What is it doing in Atlanta?

18:20.588 --> 18:22.038
Who is this country that speaks English?

18:22.263 --> 18:22.933
It's America.

18:23.051 --> 18:24.541
Everyday she learns something new.

18:24.602 --> 18:26.845
Okay, Dennis, it is time to get proactive on this.

18:27.008 --> 18:29.922
This is when mild mannered Jason Stiles suddenly darted into a phone booth

18:29.999 --> 18:32.143
and ripped off his shirt and became - Proactive Man.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.757
What? I'm sorry I didn't get that last part.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.383
Able to be proactive where ever there is activity of a pro nature.

18:36.434 --> 18:37.438
Dennis, just do this.

18:38.103 --> 18:41.360
A messenger is coming in an hour to pick up the box with the checks --

18:41.427 --> 18:43.700
the box with the checks in the drawer by the floor.

18:43.761 --> 18:45.819
The vessel with the pestle holds the brew that is true.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.738
I'm sorry, I'm kind of distracted.

18:48.850 --> 18:49.653
Get off the phone!

18:49.874 --> 18:51.783
It's the last one, I promise - two minutes tops.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.351
Two minutes and I'm going to throw that thing in the lake.

18:53.418 --> 18:54.888
- There's a lake? 
- We just drove by the lake.

18:55.005 --> 18:56.551
Aw, I missed the lake, can we drive by it again later?

18:56.851 --> 18:57.912
Two minutes!

19:10.894 --> 19:14.352
My deliveryman is very good, very dependable. He will call you with a two hour window.

19:14.426 --> 19:16.027
- Let me check his availability. 
- Thank you

19:16.192 --> 19:18.214
- Hi Mrs. Kim. Hi. 
- Lorelai.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.185
Wow, you've got a lot of new stuff in here.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.685
She's fine. She's at Yale with Rory.

19:30.763 --> 19:31.573
Here it is.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.980
Let's see, we have Monday between one and three open.

19:36.062 --> 19:36.780
Great.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.893
No, no, no. I don't see any reason why that can't work out.

19:43.123 --> 19:46.376
Okay! Ah, I'm sorry but your two minutes are up. Asia, Africa and where ever Jvork is from

19:46.463 --> 19:49.568
is just going to have to wait because I'm putting a kibosh on that phone.

19:49.669 --> 19:52.165
I'm sorry mister but I'm clicking that thing off myself.

19:52.384 --> 19:54.438
No, no, no. I am still here, Emily!

19:55.872 --> 19:58.370
There's just a lot of commotion around me.

19:59.512 --> 20:02.052
No, I'm not in the office. I took the morning off.

20:03.086 --> 20:06.137
Yes, Richard deserves a morning off too.

20:07.443 --> 20:10.726
Okay, I'll see you at the hotel. Okay, bye.

20:12.061 --> 20:14.355
I pulled a muscle waving at you.

20:14.452 --> 20:16.408
How was I supposed to know you were talking to my mother?

20:16.490 --> 20:20.427
It was a very personal wave. It was a big, broad, over the top personal wave.

20:20.488 --> 20:21.774
- She called you? 
- She called.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.427
Are you doing like a Mrs. Robinson thing with my mother?

20:24.605 --> 20:28.143
Yes. I was visiting Richard one day, and he stepped out and Emily lit a cigarette

20:28.209 --> 20:31.358
- and did that triangle thing with her thigh. 
- Well, you said hotel.

20:31.461 --> 20:35.357
Well, she wants me to come to some charity thing at a hotel tomorrow.

20:36.315 --> 20:39.611
Hey, wait, wait a minute. If I can't be on the phone then you cannot be on the phon..

20:39.668 --> 20:40.134
Hello?

20:40.185 --> 20:42.857
- Lorelai, its me. 
- Lorelai Gilmore's a hypocrite!

20:42.935 --> 20:45.040
- Hello Emily! 
- Why are you calling me Emily?

20:45.179 --> 20:48.059
'Cause that's your name, ask me again and I tell you the same.

20:48.138 --> 20:50.322
- And who was that yelling? 
- No one you'd know. What's up?

20:50.423 --> 20:53.903
Well, I'm having trouble filling these eight seats your father bought

20:53.978 --> 20:57.399
for the rare manuscript acquisition charity dinner tomorrow night.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.746
This is Jason. Oops.

20:58.838 --> 21:00.870
That's the same man I heard before. Is he harassing you?

21:00.953 --> 21:05.627
Ah, err, yes. I'm on the street. Get away you! It's just insanity out here today.

21:05.693 --> 21:08.168
Well, that's not good. Walk down a different street.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.553
I'm turning the corner as we speak. So, what, there's a manuscript thing?

21:10.631 --> 21:14.684
Yes, it's a fund-raiser, and we're stuck and I'm desperate for attendees.

21:14.757 --> 21:16.732
- I'll go. Sure. Yes. 
- Really?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.688
I'll be there. How much - how much do I give?

21:18.746 --> 21:20.015
Nothing. We've already paid.

21:20.076 --> 21:23.312
Okay, why don't you leave the details on where to meet up and all on the home machine.

21:23.373 --> 21:26.640
I will, thank you, and please get out of the street.

21:26.737 --> 21:27.689
I will, bye.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.461
Okay, okay, bye. Did she hear me?

21:30.543 --> 21:32.241
Yes, but she thinks you're a raving street loon.

21:32.385 --> 21:35.359
Okay, this is exactly the reason why I hate hiding relationships

21:35.452 --> 21:36.916
- I know. 
- We're gonna get caught.

21:37.049 --> 21:39.240
- We can't tell them. 
- We're gonna get caught.

21:39.316 --> 21:41.985
- This is just a freak occurrence. 
- This is destined to be repeated.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.454
They'll be mad that I hid it.

21:43.558 --> 21:45.631
They'll be madder the longer you hide it.

21:45.732 --> 21:48.344
They'll screw things up, I don't want that. I like us.

21:48.421 --> 21:49.512
But, it's inevitable.

21:49.891 --> 21:54.814
They're gonna see us together someplace, or a traffic report will take pictures of cars on the expressway

21:54.888 --> 21:58.006
and we'll be sitting in the car - and then Richard will be watching the news and he will see us,

21:58.083 --> 22:01.851
so barring some sort of Star Trek-like cloaking device -

22:01.932 --> 22:04.477
which was problematic in every incarnation of Star Trek -

22:04.536 --> 22:07.293
I remember Kirk complaining about it, I remember Picard complaining about it -

22:07.386 --> 22:09.532
they will see us, and we'll get caught.

22:09.643 --> 22:11.425
I'm very uncomfortable dating a Trekkie.

22:11.702 --> 22:15.670
Ah, I just don't feel good about this. It makes me very nervous.

22:15.741 --> 22:18.916
Listen, I've a very difficult phone call this morning with our Japanese partners

22:18.976 --> 22:23.463
and I didn't ever break a sweat, I had that testy call from the client from California -

22:23.574 --> 22:27.563
not a drop, but your mother calls and I'm soaked through.

22:27.651 --> 22:30.344
- On your morning off too, I'm sorry. 
- That's okay.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.840
Do you want me to wring your shirt out for you?

22:31.916 --> 22:34.241
No, it's old - and I like us too,

22:34.403 --> 22:37.180
by the way which is why I feel so strongly about this.

22:37.404 --> 22:38.695
- I know. 
- I'm not mad.

22:38.864 --> 22:39.622
I know that too.

22:39.687 --> 22:41.648
And I'll do what ever you want, you know them better than I.

22:42.673 --> 22:43.574
I'll tell them.

22:44.086 --> 22:45.618
- Really? 
- Yes. Yes.

22:46.421 --> 22:50.973
Tonight's our Friday night dinner. Dad's gone, but starting with Emily might be for the best.

22:51.034 --> 22:52.400
I could talk to Richard, if you want.

22:52.477 --> 22:54.530
Oh no, its my thing. I'll do it.

22:54.659 --> 22:56.707
Good. Oh, look phone is off.

22:56.768 --> 22:59.139
Oh. Good, let's go buy some furniture.

23:06.726 --> 23:08.780
So, you're just sitting here watching TV?

23:09.344 --> 23:12.006
I'm studying. Look at Ted Kennedy, huh?

23:12.134 --> 23:14.556
I always admired him as a senator, but you see him and think:

23:14.617 --> 23:17.378
It's just so unfair that fat men look good in suits.

23:17.534 --> 23:20.156
We girls get a couple of pounds and every piece of fashion betrays…

23:20.227 --> 23:21.247
- Off. 
- What?

23:21.422 --> 23:23.669
I want to talk to you about your boyfriend situation, Paris.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.366
- Jamie? 
- I'm sorry, I should have clarified "boyfriends."

23:25.543 --> 23:27.139
Oh. You mean a certain other fella.

23:27.233 --> 23:30.909
Let's cut the coyness. I want to talk about you having an affair with Professor Asher Fleming

23:31.001 --> 23:35.030
and at the same time stringing along poor Jamie, with no concern for his feelings.

23:35.132 --> 23:35.886
It's not an affair.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.541
Affair. Relationship. Fling. Tete-a-tete. What ever you want to call it.

23:39.639 --> 23:41.726
- Well, I'm very surprised by this. 
- How so?

23:41.861 --> 23:43.519
You've never wanted to discuss Asher before.

23:43.593 --> 23:46.495
Well, I don't particularly want to discuss him now, but I'm forced to.

23:46.566 --> 23:48.205
- What's forcing you... 
- I just ran into Jamie,

23:48.275 --> 23:52.786
and he's wandering around lonely, missing you, scared of losing you,

23:52.822 --> 23:54.369
and you're sitting here watching C-SPAN!

23:54.441 --> 23:56.693
Nobody watches C-SPAN. It's just on in the background.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.340
Well you gotta choose Paris, because this is becoming pretty clear

23:59.391 --> 24:02.125
that the what-ever-you-want-to-call-it with the professor is not a short-lived thing.

24:02.186 --> 24:04.707
I'd say that's accurate, and you can just call him Asher.

24:04.824 --> 24:07.785
No, he's my teacher, so I think I'll stick with professor.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.815
- Professor just makes him sound old. 
- He IS old!

24:09.897 --> 24:14.588
He's sixty. Today's sixty is what fifty was twenty years ago and he's got the body of a forty year old.

24:14.676 --> 24:16.441
I really don't want to talk about his body.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.987
I'm not denying that we've got a May-December romance going on here.

24:19.062 --> 24:23.410
This is not May-December, this is May - Ming Dynasty.

24:23.497 --> 24:25.162
An age difference like this is very common.

24:25.224 --> 24:27.643
People dating people the same age are passe now.

24:27.853 --> 24:31.535
My grandfather introduced you to him. Do you see how awkward this is for me?

24:31.597 --> 24:33.480
Well, hot men tend to run in packs.

24:33.804 --> 24:35.810
Do not ever say anything like that again.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.055
Mary, you are such a prude.

24:37.173 --> 24:40.684
Well, at least I'm not mean to people who love me. Where is your heart?

24:40.766 --> 24:44.454
I know I've mishandled the Jamie situation. He just can't take a hint.

24:44.607 --> 24:48.211
Well, you gotta do something, because one of us here does care about Jamie and I think its me.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.433
I know. He's my first real boyfriend.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.658
Well, you got lucky with him.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.238
And he's crazy about me, I never quite figured out why.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.455
Oh, don't get so self-deprecating. It's obnoxious.

24:56.526 --> 24:59.215
He's been so forgiving. I've been pretty mean.

24:59.352 --> 25:01.317
Just talk to him and see how it goes.

25:03.362 --> 25:06.490
Hey, it's me. We've got to end this - now.

25:07.027 --> 25:10.519
There's just no reason to prolong it. Sorry you came all the way out here.

25:10.868 --> 25:14.672
Well, Rory show me the light. She made me see there's just no point in going on.

25:14.764 --> 25:15.445
Paris!

25:15.516 --> 25:18.296
No, she just came home and we talked. She's right here if you want to ask her, yourself.

25:18.348 --> 25:19.438
Do not give me that phone!

25:19.526 --> 25:23.166
Anyhow, I'm really sorry Jamie. Really. Bye.

25:24.968 --> 25:26.985
That had all the tact of a Nazi storm trooper.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.197
- It was your idea. 
- Breaking up was not my idea.

25:29.253 --> 25:31.193
Well, he'd be stupid if he thought that's why I'd do it.

25:32.593 --> 25:35.725
This was good. It was right. I'm glad I did it.

25:36.371 --> 25:37.636
You can have the TV if you want.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.770
Hello Luke. It's getting cold again isn't it?

25:45.833 --> 25:48.151
Yup, it's that unpredictable time of year, Mrs. Cassini.

25:48.327 --> 25:50.026
- Stay warm. 
- Yeah, you too.

26:08.105 --> 26:13.624
It's a Rambler Ambassador, four door, a rusty brown pretty much a beat-up clunker.

26:14.402 --> 26:17.572
No. I don't know how long its been missing.

26:20.055 --> 26:21.648
I mean I saw it for sure last week.

26:23.204 --> 26:26.374
Nah, I don't drive it much, it's a second car, okay?

26:28.191 --> 26:32.406
Just, just call me when you find it. Thanks, Bye.

26:35.359 --> 26:36.783
- Oh hey. 
- Hey.

26:36.917 --> 26:39.881
Tanna just told me that that Chester Fleet guy liked her hair and asked her out.

26:39.957 --> 26:40.858
She's throwing up now.

26:40.991 --> 26:41.681
Good for her.

26:42.347 --> 26:43.132
Going somewhere?

26:43.420 --> 26:44.335
Home for the weekend.

26:44.755 --> 26:45.758
Just to get away from me?

26:46.254 --> 26:48.994
No, I've got dinner at my grandma's tonight - obligatory thing -

26:49.060 --> 26:53.055
and our town's having its Firelight Festival tomorrow which I haven't missed since I was one,

26:53.222 --> 26:57.754
so not seeing you is - Well - quite frankly just a fringe benefit.

26:58.174 --> 27:00.259
Would it make you feel any better to know how awful I feel?

27:00.406 --> 27:01.124
Nope.

27:01.225 --> 27:03.028
I don't understand why you're so upset about this.

27:03.063 --> 27:03.909
I know you don't.

27:03.991 --> 27:05.839
 I tried to call Jamie again, he won't pick up.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.706
- Can you blame him? 
- No. I know I let it go too long.

27:08.814 --> 27:12.711
I just wasn't sure what Asher was thinking at first. I wasn't sure if it was just a fling for him.

27:12.822 --> 27:16.073
But over the past couple of weeks, he's been mentioning stuff about the future.

27:16.167 --> 27:19.233
He's spending a month teaching a couple of courses at Oxford over the summer

27:19.310 --> 27:21.496
and then he asked me what I was planning to do over the summer.

27:21.854 --> 27:25.587
I mean there is a definite implication that he was wondering if I was available during the summer.

27:25.940 --> 27:29.203
I think he might ask me to go with him to Oxford. I mean, why else would he ask?

27:29.304 --> 27:31.024
- Beats me. 
- I'm not counting my chickens…

27:31.101 --> 27:32.811
- Its good thinking. 
- But it is the first indication.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.735
- Look, I've gotta hit the road. 
- It was his accent that did it.

27:35.914 --> 27:39.682
I'm such the total Anglophile. When I was a kid, I was in love with Neal Kinnock.

27:39.734 --> 27:41.306
- Who? 
- The former head of the Labour party.

27:41.357 --> 27:44.864
Teeth like a horse, but oh that voice, and then there was Roger Moore -

27:44.935 --> 27:47.332
- English accents are nice. 
- He TiVos Frontline.

27:47.403 --> 27:48.531
- Who does? 
- Asher.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.338
- So we can watch it together. 
- Terrific.

27:50.394 --> 27:52.074
You don't think he meant we'd be together this summer?

27:52.213 --> 27:54.378
- I wasn't there. 
- I'm not counting my chickens.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.625
- I think that's smart. 
- I never wanted to hurt Jamie.

27:57.393 --> 28:00.844
I just don't know how to do these things. I'm not very nice sometimes.

28:01.606 --> 28:03.302
I hope Asher doesn't see that in me.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.648
I didn't mean to hold you up. Have a good weekend.

28:09.369 --> 28:11.714
I just want you to be happy. You know that, right?

28:11.832 --> 28:14.012
Thanks. I'm happy.

28:24.022 --> 28:27.103
Mom? Hello?

28:31.431 --> 28:34.237
Oh, Rory. Good. I did not go suddenly half deaf.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.756
- Were you supposed to meet me here? 
- No, I'm a surprise.

28:36.832 --> 28:38.871
- As was your conception. 
- I'll just be two minutes.

28:39.004 --> 28:40.160
As was your conception.

28:40.391 --> 28:43.407
- Hey, how was your day with Jason? 
- Fun! He makes me laugh.

28:43.551 --> 28:44.548
Aww, I like that

28:44.753 --> 28:49.314
He's very off-center. It's been a while since I've been with someone off-center.

28:49.382 --> 28:49.975
Cool.

28:50.411 --> 28:53.038
I'm telling Mom tonight - about us.

28:53.529 --> 28:55.265
I think Grandma knows you're my mother.

28:55.685 --> 28:56.816
About me and Jason.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.603
- Very brave. 
- Yeah.

28:59.012 --> 29:01.020
Jason's wanted to from the beginning.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.624
It's the mature thing to do and that's why I didn't want to do it, but it's time.

29:04.268 --> 29:05.408
That's weird

29:05.596 --> 29:06.314
What's weird?

29:06.780 --> 29:07.434
This.

29:07.594 --> 29:08.408
Bread? Bread is weird?

29:08.474 --> 29:10.680
It's weird when its here. It does not make a good snack.

29:10.881 --> 29:13.164
It does when you add stuff to it, like cheese.

29:13.216 --> 29:13.861
We have cheese?

29:14.014 --> 29:16.713
Yeah. It's not "Donner Pass", we have cheese.

29:16.943 --> 29:19.359
Whoa! It's like a frickin' cornucopia.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.121
- Yeah, there's the stuff. 
- There's the cheese!

29:21.193 --> 29:23.184
Yeah, yeah. Why are you making such a big deal about this?

29:23.281 --> 29:26.394
Because we never had real food in this house the whole time I was growing up.

29:26.476 --> 29:29.052
What? We always had food. This fridge was never empty.

29:29.186 --> 29:32.493
Well, yeah. We had left overs from take-out - cold pizza, Luke's fries,

29:32.574 --> 29:35.627
- but never stuff you had to assemble. 
- Okay chill out on the inquiry.

29:35.687 --> 29:36.511
Is that a cucumber?

29:36.580 --> 29:39.722
Listen, you'd make a terrible private investigator, because you get hung up

29:39.768 --> 29:43.254
on all sorts of dumb stuff that does not matter - now come on. We're late, I'll drive.

29:43.328 --> 29:45.519
Sounds good. Oh my God, is that a tomato?

29:45.569 --> 29:46.132
Enough already.

29:50.996 --> 29:53.049
Ah, my girls are arriving together.

29:53.116 --> 29:54.177
- Hi, Mom. 
- Hi, Grandma.

29:54.529 --> 29:56.455
- You smell like coffee. 
- We haven't had any.

29:56.889 --> 29:58.681
It's so strong.

29:58.749 --> 30:00.397
Okay, Mom. I really don't like you sniffing me.

30:00.674 --> 30:01.605
Hey where's Grandpa tonight?

30:01.768 --> 30:04.728
He's in Manhattan having dinner with clients. He just called.

30:04.851 --> 30:07.151
They're at some restaurant near Times Square.

30:07.259 --> 30:09.956
He said that Times Square just keeps getting cleaner and cleaner.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.589
They didn't stumble upon one prostitute the whole night.

30:12.676 --> 30:15.374
Oh yeah. I heard the Disney Company had them all killed.

30:15.870 --> 30:18.926
What I don't understand is why Jason wouldn't make this trip instead.

30:18.994 --> 30:21.753
Oh. Well, he's maybe busy with his own thing.

30:21.845 --> 30:24.844
I know for a fact he wasn't. Richard said he took the whole morning off.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.892
Well, everyone deserves an occasional morning off.

30:26.986 --> 30:28.388
Richard never takes a morning off.

30:28.543 --> 30:32.152
He's up every day at five-thirty on the phone then it's out the door to the office.

30:32.305 --> 30:34.446
I bet Jason doesn't roll out of bed until eight.

30:34.517 --> 30:38.260
On the contrary - he - probably gets up earlier than eight.

30:38.311 --> 30:40.477
You know, I would think that he would have to, to keep up with Dad.

30:40.545 --> 30:42.055
- Makes sense. 
- Just a guess.

30:42.161 --> 30:45.822
I just find that boy so irritating. He's always trying to get in good with me.

30:45.879 --> 30:51.210
Complimenting me, agreeing with me. He's absolutely prostrating himself at my feet. It's so weak.

30:51.260 --> 30:55.108
Well you're a formidable opponent, Mom. They don't call you the Edie Amine of the DAR for nothing.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.906
He's so grating about it. I'm never fully comfortable around him.

30:57.988 --> 30:59.442
Well you should maybe try harder.

30:59.539 --> 31:03.819
I try. But every time I see him a new facet of his Jason-ish comes out.

31:03.917 --> 31:07.547
It's good to have different facets, and there's probably a lot you don't know about him.

31:07.634 --> 31:11.008
Oh, I'm sure about that. You two would be perfect for each other.

31:11.198 --> 31:14.039
What? Who, me and Jason?

31:14.147 --> 31:16.113
- A match made in heaven. 
- Well, thanks a lot!

31:16.190 --> 31:17.219
Don't get upset.

31:17.280 --> 31:21.990
Well Mom, you just spent the last five minutes listing every off-putting quality Jason has,

31:22.072 --> 31:25.094
real or imagined and then you put me on his level and you say we're perfect together.

31:27.806 --> 31:29.194
What's so funny?

31:30.133 --> 31:31.827
I'm sorry -

31:32.481 --> 31:36.496
Did I miss something? Did a clown come in behind me and start doing funny pratfalls, what?

31:36.619 --> 31:42.102
Just the idea of you and Jason together, it's funny.

31:42.676 --> 31:43.351
It's funny.

31:43.443 --> 31:47.145
It's very funny. I just said it as a joke.

31:47.248 --> 31:51.098
- You said it as a joke. 
- You took it so seriously.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.847
- But why is it so funny? 
- Well, think about it.

31:53.929 --> 31:56.336
I am. I just trying to figure out what you're thinking.

31:56.490 --> 31:57.867
Well, it's obvious.

31:57.990 --> 32:01.006
It's not obvious to me or to Rory. Rory's wondering, aren't you?

32:01.175 --> 32:05.370
- Yeah, why is that so funny, Grandma? 
- It would just be so ludicrous.

32:05.553 --> 32:10.058
But why, because he's a - you know, he's a hard-working guy from what I know.

32:10.190 --> 32:15.941
I'm sorry, you're making me laugh even harder about it. I just said it off hand.

32:16.715 --> 32:17.630
I know.

32:17.953 --> 32:18.726
Martini?

32:18.875 --> 32:21.281
You didn't have to shake it much with all that laughing, you know,

32:21.343 --> 32:23.195
the laughing just shook it on up for ya.

32:24.164 --> 32:26.354
It's good to laugh like that once in a while.

32:26.458 --> 32:27.932
Oh yeah. I know.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.263
You okay?

32:39.718 --> 32:40.486
You didn't tell her.

32:42.173 --> 32:42.868
Next time?

32:44.424 --> 32:46.394
How are your motor skills? I'll drive.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.163
- Luke. 
- Oh, Hey Coop.

32:54.229 --> 32:55.272
Good news, found the car.

32:55.509 --> 32:58.249
Oh good. Who would steal that thing. It's just a hunk of junk.

32:58.365 --> 33:00.940
It broke down on the expressway a couple of hours ago, the guy was in it.

33:01.432 --> 33:02.236
You got the guy?

33:02.333 --> 33:04.325
Yeah, but there's not a lot we can do, the guy's the owner.

33:04.641 --> 33:05.640
What do you mean? I'm the owner.

33:05.728 --> 33:08.298
Well, not according to the registration. It's registered to a --

33:08.339 --> 33:09.409
Jess Mariano.

33:09.501 --> 33:10.915
Yep. Says you're his uncle.

33:12.225 --> 33:15.230
Registration's long expired, too. It needs seeing to.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.606
But I just figured that since these seems like a family matter,

33:17.658 --> 33:19.484
I'd bring the car and the kid back to you.

33:23.274 --> 33:24.698
Yeah, a family matter.

33:27.810 --> 33:29.526
- Where do you want it? 
- Right there's fine.

33:29.654 --> 33:30.586
This isn't wasn't my idea.

33:30.755 --> 33:31.953
You'll take care of the registration?

33:32.019 --> 33:33.740
- Yeah, thanks Coop. 
- Yeah, thanks Coop.

33:33.856 --> 33:34.758
Lets go, Frank.

33:38.215 --> 33:39.162
Well, look who's back.

33:39.223 --> 33:40.928
I'm only here to retrieve my property.

33:41.015 --> 33:42.638
- You've got a lot of nerve. 
- You've got a lot of nerve.

33:42.694 --> 33:44.185
- How so? 
- You stole my car.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.795
Coop should have arrested you, why didn't he arrest you?

33:46.929 --> 33:47.727
Free donuts.

33:48.096 --> 33:48.807
Beautiful.

33:49.555 --> 33:50.835
So you got anything you wanna say?

33:52.198 --> 33:53.599
You could have washed it once in a while?

33:53.662 --> 33:58.306
Okay fine, the car is yours, our business here is done, hasta la vista, have a nice life.

33:58.382 --> 34:01.008
Our business here is not done. My car is wrecked because of you.

34:01.070 --> 34:01.551
Oh yeah?

34:01.618 --> 34:05.377
Three of the tires are leaking, its got no oil, the floats in the carburetor are probably cracked

34:05.473 --> 34:08.955
so it's back-firing like mad, I mean, people were ducking when I was driving by.

34:09.042 --> 34:10.853
Then it stalled and wouldn't start.

34:10.931 --> 34:14.648
Well, you can find Mr. Goodwrench in the Yellow Pages, I think it's under M or is it G?

34:14.725 --> 34:17.051
I can never tell with those kinds of things.

34:17.132 --> 34:19.405
- You're paying for the repairs. 
- Oh, don't make me laugh.

34:19.467 --> 34:20.844
It's broken because of you.

34:20.916 --> 34:23.819
That thing was a piece of junk to begin with, the paint is the only thing holding it together.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.469
And the expired registration? I'm gonna have to pay a fine.

34:26.538 --> 34:28.601
So, I guess it didn't work out with your dad, huh?

34:28.913 --> 34:29.989
It worked out fine.

34:30.070 --> 34:32.083
So, what are you doing back East, buddy? Still searching?

34:32.155 --> 34:32.911
Been traveling.

34:33.034 --> 34:36.257
Well, thanks for all the swell cards and letters you sent while you were away.

34:36.312 --> 34:38.717
You kicked me out, what were you expecting - a candygram?

34:38.780 --> 34:40.833
I didn't kick you out, you got yourself kicked out.

34:40.899 --> 34:42.983
Nice spin, you should work for Bush.

34:43.050 --> 34:45.092
So what did you get out of this Kerouac trip of yours?

34:45.159 --> 34:47.617
You write the great American novel or something? You learn how to play the harmonica?

34:47.674 --> 34:49.311
What do you care, you're not my guardian anymore.

34:49.373 --> 34:50.996
And I bless every day that I'm not.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.387
Well, when you're not good at something, it's best to cut and run.

34:53.454 --> 34:55.987
Aww, I'm sorry I tried to give you a decent life, Jess.

34:56.040 --> 35:00.263
I'm sorry I didn't think driving a fork-lift for the rest of your life was good enough for you.

35:00.331 --> 35:04.021
Oh that is condescending, isn't it? I thought you were a friend of the working man.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.676
Oh, that sister of mine, what a prize. What a prize.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.044
What does she have to do with any of this?

35:09.105 --> 35:12.224
I tell her about the car, she runs and tells you. That's what happened, right?

35:12.276 --> 35:14.001
Her claiming she had no contact.

35:14.087 --> 35:18.808
Again, the car is mine. Liz was doing the right thing, that's what family does.

35:18.885 --> 35:21.357
Family? What a joke coming from you.

35:21.930 --> 35:24.467
- Go clean your counters, I'm tired. 
- So, you staying in town?

35:24.594 --> 35:27.231
I don't know of any twenty-four hour auto shops around here, do you?

35:27.323 --> 35:29.383
- Well, you're not staying with me. 
- It didn't cross my mind.

35:29.427 --> 35:30.533
Get it fixed quick.

35:30.605 --> 35:32.729
Believe me, no one wants it fixed faster than me.

35:33.103 --> 35:34.987
You stay away from her while you're here.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.574
- Stay away from who? 
- You know who I mean.

35:37.661 --> 35:39.165
Gee, you're so cryptic.

35:39.243 --> 35:41.418
You've done all the damage there you're gonna, okay?

35:41.624 --> 35:43.691
I'm here to get my car, then I'm gone.

35:46.380 --> 35:48.873
- Where are you staying? 
- Backseat's as comfy as anywhere.

35:48.950 --> 35:49.553
Fine.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.296
Please do not say that word again.

36:00.393 --> 36:01.223
It's a free country.

36:01.565 --> 36:03.843
Just say hot chocolate or say nothing at all.

36:03.905 --> 36:05.539
Mmm, terrific "Ho-Cho".

36:05.636 --> 36:08.180
Oooh, I hate that. It's so cutsey-wootsey.

36:08.237 --> 36:09.773
Do you hate it as much as my favorite summer treat?

36:09.849 --> 36:11.426
- Don't! 
- An ice-cold Fro-Yo!

36:11.514 --> 36:13.746
Stop! Just stop - who are you calling?

36:13.848 --> 36:15.876
I'm calling Jason, I promised I would check in.

36:19.202 --> 36:21.299
- Hello. 
- I'm dying here, how'd it go?

36:21.416 --> 36:22.589
Well, it didn't.

36:23.843 --> 36:24.508
Sorry.

36:24.678 --> 36:25.369
You chicken out?

36:25.548 --> 36:28.635
Na - it's a long story - the timing was very bad.

36:28.727 --> 36:31.563
- You chickened out. 
- No, no. I - ah, yeah - kind of.

36:31.615 --> 36:34.493
- Lorelai, we've got to do it. 
- Well, the timing has to be right

36:34.565 --> 36:37.308
It's going to be awkward no matter when you do it.

36:37.385 --> 36:38.548
Not if they're both unconscious.

36:38.625 --> 36:41.015
Yeah, but then you're going to be dealing with why both your parents are unconscious,

36:41.088 --> 36:45.117
and doctors consultations, and phoning friends and relatives - the timing is bad there too.

36:45.501 --> 36:48.926
Listen, it's ah - trust me, this was not good timing,

36:49.029 --> 36:51.931
and I swear to you there'll be much better timing in the near future.

36:53.175 --> 36:56.233
Well, near is near - I can't define it more than that.

36:57.082 --> 36:59.500
Uh, it's closer than far, how's that?

37:02.351 --> 37:03.651
I don't believe this.

37:04.301 --> 37:09.037
Uh, honey - I gotta call you back, okay? Bye. Um, is that - ?

37:09.422 --> 37:10.465
- Yes. 
- Oh.

37:11.069 --> 37:12.089
I don't believe this.

37:13.338 --> 37:15.029
- What is he doing here? 
- What is he doing - there?

37:15.095 --> 37:17.091
Asleep in his car - is he living in it?

37:17.183 --> 37:18.080
I don't see stuff.

37:18.397 --> 37:20.026
Does Luke know he's here?

37:20.196 --> 37:22.212
Well, I know what you know.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.409
He - may not know.

37:24.792 --> 37:27.568
Well, it's right in front of his place. How could he not know?

37:27.634 --> 37:30.019
Well, it's freezing out here. He could die, he must not know.

37:30.118 --> 37:30.971
Or doesn't care.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.631
Do you think David Blain put him up to this?

37:32.763 --> 37:34.745
Why is he here? I mean, why did he come back?

37:34.929 --> 37:37.571
Light's still on in there, Luke's in there somewhere - should we go talk to him?

37:37.653 --> 37:41.965
No. It's too weird. And it's - weird.

37:42.119 --> 37:43.101
Definitely weird.

37:43.255 --> 37:44.391
Well, I'll just see you at home.

37:44.622 --> 37:47.336
I'm - cause I don't want to deal with this. I'll see you at home.

37:56.798 --> 37:57.622
Hey, come on in.

37:58.159 --> 37:59.674
Are you aware of whose out there?

37:59.768 --> 38:00.509
Yeah, I'm aware

38:00.642 --> 38:02.264
- That he's sleeping in his car? 
- Yeah.

38:02.358 --> 38:05.199
- It's about thirty-five degrees. 
- He's a tough guy, he can take it.

38:05.347 --> 38:07.011
Luke, why is he back here?

38:07.072 --> 38:08.750
- Because I'm stupid. 
- Meaning?

38:08.933 --> 38:12.455
Well his mom showed up -- for what reason I don't know --

38:12.516 --> 38:15.707
I'm still waiting for that shoe to drop. I mention Jess' car

38:15.788 --> 38:17.242
and then - boom - there's Jess.

38:17.513 --> 38:20.498
So the mystery woman from this morning? That's Liz?

38:20.570 --> 38:21.824
In all her glory.

38:22.551 --> 38:23.600
Quite a day you've had.

38:24.014 --> 38:25.106
Oh, it's been delightful.

38:25.428 --> 38:30.252
I think Bobby McFerrin's gonna write one of those happy boop-boopdy-doo songs of his about this.

38:30.312 --> 38:33.626
I mean, she lied to me about having contact with Jess, so she's lied about everything else.

38:33.723 --> 38:35.391
But why is he sleeping in his car?

38:35.746 --> 38:39.074
Because he's going to wait to have it fixed, it's a point of pride with the little punk.

38:39.126 --> 38:42.467
But please, don't tell Rory, he'll be gone tomorrow, no reason to upset her.

38:42.546 --> 38:44.721
- Well, she's already seen him. 
- Oh man!

38:44.880 --> 38:46.241
She's fine Luke. She's over it.

38:46.340 --> 38:48.209
Well, he won't go near her, I'll make sure of that.

38:48.259 --> 38:51.501
Again, I don't think it's necessary. She can fend for herself.

38:51.555 --> 38:53.964
- What a lie it all is! 
- All what is?

38:54.054 --> 38:56.958
Families. I mean, they're just messes.

38:57.234 --> 39:01.567
It's like this - spilled drink that just keeps spilling, and ya gotta keep cleaning it up,

39:01.654 --> 39:04.474
and you scrub and you scrub and you just can't get the stain up!

39:04.678 --> 39:07.408
Show me a happy family - just one.

39:07.485 --> 39:09.763
Didn't that Tolstoy-guy say something about families?

39:09.824 --> 39:11.161
- Probably 
- It's a famous thing he said.

39:11.227 --> 39:15.799
It's like: "all families are unhappy" …or, or, or "happy on the surface"…

39:15.862 --> 39:19.252
- or "unhappy in the same way"… 
- Sounds a little incomplete.

39:19.323 --> 39:22.753
Well, y'know, maybe he couldn't complete the thought because he was dealing with his stinkin' family.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.744
Do the Hallmark people know about you? 'Cause you're a natural.

39:24.822 --> 39:30.217
I'm tired of cleaning up messes. I'm tired of helping people who do nothing to help themselves!

39:30.279 --> 39:31.267
I'm sorry you're so upset.

39:33.146 --> 39:35.930
I just don't want you to have to deal with the frozen carcass in the morning

39:36.019 --> 39:37.298
- He'll be fine. 
- Okay.

39:38.896 --> 39:43.187
Try to get some rest, okay? Relax. Watch a little TV - no family shows…

39:44.508 --> 39:46.361
Yeah, yeah… I'm going up now.

39:47.623 --> 39:48.215
Bye.

39:58.143 --> 39:59.024
- Hey. 
- Hey.

40:01.685 --> 40:02.613
So, do you want an update?

40:03.191 --> 40:03.822
I guess.

40:04.189 --> 40:06.407
Well, the whole thing -

40:07.744 --> 40:10.068
the mystery woman from this morning? Jess' mom.

40:10.263 --> 40:10.913
Whoa.

40:11.353 --> 40:14.455
Still a mystery though. Luke's not quite sure what she's up to.

40:14.558 --> 40:15.423
She came with Jess?

40:15.706 --> 40:17.902
She called him or something. It's very confusing.

40:17.993 --> 40:20.165
Luke was not in an expansive story telling mood.

40:20.241 --> 40:23.949
All he knows is that Jess said he came for his car and he's not leaving without it.

40:24.311 --> 40:25.228
- Okay. 
- Yeah.

40:25.309 --> 40:29.227
Which means he might be here part of the day tomorrow, so uh, "Danger, Will Robinson."

40:29.309 --> 40:30.476
I can live with it, really.

40:30.588 --> 40:32.315
- That's what I told Luke. 
- Good.

40:32.892 --> 40:37.828
Okay. So, I'm going to go upstairs, get warm - Good night.

40:37.922 --> 40:39.974
- Hey, um, before you go. 
- Hmm?

40:40.128 --> 40:42.273
- What happened to our movie channels? 
- What do you mean?

40:42.370 --> 40:44.613
Well, I was flipping through cable and a bunch of our channels are gone.

40:44.718 --> 40:46.902
- Oh. Well, that's not right. 
- And you have bread.

40:47.046 --> 40:48.417
There's a connection?

40:48.546 --> 40:49.594
- Are you skimping? 
- What?

40:49.666 --> 40:53.501
Cutting back on things, cable, eating out, the bread, the cheese, the tomato.

40:53.557 --> 40:56.651
Okay, hey - if you're going to try me in a court of law,

40:56.712 --> 40:58.979
the bread, the tomato and I will need to hire a lawyer.

40:59.031 --> 41:02.150
There's no takeout in the fridge, no takeout containers in the trash.

41:02.231 --> 41:03.209
You're going through the trash?

41:03.291 --> 41:05.564
And I'm not seeing the stacks of magazines lying around.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.053
We always subscribe to everything.

41:07.130 --> 41:10.648
Yes, we do. I've read them all, they're in recycle bin - you can go check.

41:10.710 --> 41:14.397
It even seems a little darker in here - like you're using a lower watt bulb, or something.

41:14.464 --> 41:16.741
Oh my God, you're reading into everything.

41:16.828 --> 41:18.011
You're not having money problems?

41:18.099 --> 41:22.824
No. I mean, I'm not going to be on the Fortune 500 list anytime soon, but I'm fine.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.481
- With the Inn and everything? 
- Yes. We're getting a horse.

41:25.645 --> 41:27.750
Cool. And food for the horse?

41:27.841 --> 41:28.912
He'll be well fed.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.258
Just as long as you're well fed too.

41:30.376 --> 41:33.736
Yeah, I'll call the cable company in the morning. I think we should be getting those channels.

41:33.832 --> 41:34.851
Well, you'd tell me, right?

41:35.322 --> 41:35.947
Yes.

41:36.945 --> 41:37.604
Well, goodnight.

41:37.856 --> 41:38.737
Good night angel.

42:07.384 --> 42:08.167
Go away.

42:11.469 --> 42:13.452
- What? 
- I'm spending the night with Nicole.

42:13.512 --> 42:15.723
- Thanks for the update. 
- The hidden key is still in the same place.

42:15.822 --> 42:18.845
Now, you can stay out here and freeze to death if you want or you can go inside,

42:18.941 --> 42:20.748
I don't really give a damn, it makes no difference to me.

42:20.967 --> 42:21.797
Fine.
