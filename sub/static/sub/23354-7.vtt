00:02.302 --> 00:04.371
Tonight, on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:04.404 --> 00:06.340
Gordon travels though
the California desert

00:06.373 --> 00:08.408
and doesn't exactly find
an oasis.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.844
This has to be one of the worst
restaurants I've ever seen

00:10.878 --> 00:12.412
in my entire
cooking career.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.114
The food is wretched.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.817
- This is outrageous.
- Sticks to your  hand.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.385
Oh, God.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.923
The restaurant is a mess.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.725
It looks like somebody
peed on the ceiling,

00:24.758 --> 00:27.694
The walls, the doors.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.897
Could be throw-up.

00:29.930 --> 00:30.000
The owners are clueless.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.032
The owners are clueless.

00:32.065 --> 00:33.600
Why would you open a restaurant
if you'd never worked in one?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.269
'Cause we're insane.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.170
And the chef
is a ticking time bomb.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.805
What part of that don't you
frickin' understand?

00:38.839 --> 00:40.407
Ready to explode.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.775
It's a bad
in' day, pal.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.310
Bad day?!
Enough?

00:43.343 --> 00:45.279
Could this be the restaurant

00:45.312 --> 00:47.781
that leaves Gordon with
more questions than answers?

00:47.814 --> 00:49.583
I don't know
what's wrong with you,

00:49.616 --> 00:51.151
I don't know what's wrong
with you, and I

00:51.184 --> 00:52.886
don't know why they ing
even opened a restaurant.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.155
It's desperate times
in the desert,

00:55.188 --> 00:58.792
Next, on Kitchen Nightmares.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.000
Maybe that's the secret
success behind this place.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.961
Maybe that's the secret
success behind this place.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.563
Burn the  thing
down.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.350
Lancaster, California,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.252
70 miles
north of Los Angeles,

01:25.285 --> 01:26.954
is home to Casa Roma,

01:26.987 --> 01:28.889
the oldest restaurant
in the city.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.000
How's your pizza, guys?

01:30.000 --> 01:30.223
How's your pizza, guys?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.625
In spite of having

01:31.658 --> 01:33.994
Absolutely
no restaurant experience,

01:34.027 --> 01:37.264
Nylah and her son Jeremy bought
this failing landmark restaurant

01:37.297 --> 01:39.232
with the hope
of turning it around.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.834
Two-and-a-half years ago,
I was in real estate.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.803
I was sitting around looking
at business opportunities

01:43.803 --> 01:45.905
and I found Casa Roma.

01:45.938 --> 01:48.174
I talked my oldest son
into getting in with me,

01:48.207 --> 01:49.609
and had we have known

01:49.642 --> 01:51.244
the restaurant business
very well

01:51.277 --> 01:52.411
we probably
wouldn't have done it.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.546
We gotta get
this place turned.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.348
Soon.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.217
Me and my mom thought
we were buying a restaurant

01:57.250 --> 01:58.818
with a bar attached to it.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.000
You guys gonna
sit in the dining room or--

02:00.000 --> 02:00.420
You guys gonna
sit in the dining room or--

02:00.420 --> 02:01.487
We're gonna
go in the bar.
Okay.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.555
But, really,
this was a bar

02:02.556 --> 02:04.291
with a restaurant
attached to it.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.826
My bar does all my business.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.427
It's like
two different countries.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.829
Our bar is always packed,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.630
and the restaurant
sits empty.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.200
In food, on a good night,

02:13.233 --> 02:16.703
I'm making $175.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.606
On a slow night,
I'm making $9.00.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.041
I'm just asking--

02:21.074 --> 02:22.709
I don't want any
of your in' drama.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.010
That's bull,
and you know it.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.246
We've had almost 20 chefs
over the last 2 1/2 years,

02:26.279 --> 02:29.716
but I've had Drew for a year
and Erick for almost six months.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.000
Erick's a huge reason
why Casa Roma isn't doing well.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.652
Erick's a huge reason
why Casa Roma isn't doing well.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.987
Not one table!

02:34.020 --> 02:36.156
Not one table's had
their food yet.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.525
He lacks getting the food out
in a timely fashion.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.262
And his food is very bland.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.269
I'm gonna need
five chicken breasts.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.104
I'm good at this.
I'm good at it.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.572
Do I make it look fancy?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.607
Can I put pine trees
and stuff in it?

02:53.640 --> 02:54.775
That's not what I do.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.077
I make the food taste good.
It's presentable.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.479
And it's like, ",
that's pretty damn good."

02:59.513 --> 03:00.000
Erick and I do not
get along in the kitchen

03:00.000 --> 03:01.848
Erick and I do not
get along in the kitchen

03:01.882 --> 03:03.617
because he doesn't
produce very well

03:03.650 --> 03:05.352
and he expects me
to do everything.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.254
I need every ing one
of my pans right now.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.955
We totally are in dire need
of chef Ramsey's help.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.390
Because there's something

03:10.424 --> 03:12.025
that's got to be turned around
about this place.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.828
Because it definitely
is a nightmare.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.697
If I closed down,
I don't know what I would do.

03:17.731 --> 03:22.402
I raised four boys
and ran a home my whole life.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.704
Ahem, five years ago,
I got a divorce.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.007
And then I bought
this place 2 1/2 years ago,

03:27.040 --> 03:30.000
and it kind of
took up the...

03:30.000 --> 03:30.310
and it kind of
took up the...

03:30.343 --> 03:31.912
The time.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.947
I don't care about
getting rich from here.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.451
I just--it would be nice
to pay my bills, you know,

03:37.484 --> 03:42.489
and have some--some extra money
at the end of the month.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.795
"Casa Roma, since 1958."

03:48.829 --> 03:50.797
This restaurant's
nearly 50 years old,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.967
and by looking at the sign,
it shows.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.036
Time to find out
what it looks like inside.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.000
Hi.
How are you?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.942
Hi.
How are you?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.810
Oh, hi!
Nice to see you all.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.512
Nice to meet you.
Is it Nylah?

04:05.545 --> 04:06.746
I'm Nylah.
Good to see you.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.981
This is my son, Jeremy.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.483
Jeremy, how are you buddy?
Nice to see you.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.917
Now, this is, uh,
very cozy.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.185
No windows anywhere?

04:12.219 --> 04:13.753
No, not in
the bar part.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.555
We have a restaurant
part over there.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.123
In terms of business,
I mean,

04:17.157 --> 04:18.525
the bar's obviously busy.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.793
Our bar's always busy.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.261
Bar's always busy?
Always.

04:21.294 --> 04:23.063
Nice.
It's our restaurant
we can't get going...

04:23.096 --> 04:24.898
Mm-hmm.
To save our lives.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.700
What restaurant were you working
in before you got here?

04:26.733 --> 04:27.701
I wasn't.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.768
He wasn't.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.000
I work
in the grocery store

04:30.000 --> 04:30.203
I work
in the grocery store

04:30.237 --> 04:31.538
and he works
carpet cleaning.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.840
Grocery store
and carpet cleaning.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.141
I know.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.879
Is that blood down there?
What is that?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.013
No, just dirt.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.548
Oh, just dirt.
Dirt.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.149
And, just out of interest,
with no previous

04:43.183 --> 04:44.417
restaurant experience
anywhere,

04:44.451 --> 04:45.585
why would you
open a restaurant

04:45.619 --> 04:46.786
if you'd never
worked in one?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.889
'Cause we're insane.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.323
So, um, I think
it's about time

04:50.357 --> 04:51.458
I had a little taste.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.926
Okay.
Sounds good.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.027
Where's the dining room?
Right through here.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.262
Right through there.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.197
, that carpet
is disgusting.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.599
I was so excited when
Chef Ramsay walked in the door.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.000
It was like, "Wow, I can't
even believe he's here."

05:00.000 --> 05:02.335
It was like, "Wow, I can't
even believe he's here."

05:02.369 --> 05:04.704
I thought,
"Well, here we go.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.873
He's gonna see the nightmare
I'm really living."

05:12.612 --> 05:13.680
What is it?

05:18.451 --> 05:20.587
Crusty bits of lime, lemon.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.689
And bits of tissue...

05:22.722 --> 05:23.857
On my table.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.625
Hello.
Hello.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.360
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.
How are you?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.194
Good.
I'm Ashley.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.729
Ashley, like to see you,
darling.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.000
I'll just give you those.
They were on the table.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.431
I'll just give you those.
They were on the table.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.300
And little bits of lime
back from 1958.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.801
Oh...nice.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.303
Down the side of the bottom
of the chair, sorry love.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.270
That's okay.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.239
Excellent.
These seats.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.907
I feel like--I mean,
I know I'm not exactly

05:40.941 --> 05:42.609
the smallest,

05:42.642 --> 05:44.210
but I feel like
I'm just gonna...go through.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.412
Is that normal like that?

05:45.445 --> 05:47.480
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.683
I'll fix it in a minute.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.886
Um, "Casa Roma--
Fine Italian Dinning."

05:52.919 --> 05:54.087
Dining.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.090
Oh.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.258
Or is that just
an Italian spelling?

05:59.426 --> 06:00.000
Weird.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.894
Weird.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.563
Anyway, um, I'll start off
with stuffed mushrooms, please.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.065
Stuffed mushrooms.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.367
The monte cristo,
I'll go for that as well.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.568
Monte crisco.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.170
Yeah, I'm hungry
as you can see.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.806
And finally, I'm dying
to taste a pizza.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.174
A Casa Roma deluxe.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.742
What size would you like?

06:15.775 --> 06:16.876
Yeah, let's go for a medium.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.744
Medium?
Yeah.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.279
Thank you, darling.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.614
You already got it?

06:20.647 --> 06:22.015
Leave this damn
ing thing open.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.684
Hey, I got a big order.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.987
People say, "Well, he's
a five-star Michelin chef."

06:27.020 --> 06:28.855
Okay, so he's got
four tires and a spare.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.000
Kiss my.
It means nothing to me.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.925
Kiss my.
It means nothing to me.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.927
The  blinds here
are disgusting.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.061
Oh, my God.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.031
Why are you
hiding there?

06:40.266 --> 06:41.434
We're trying to see.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.969
Have they brought
any food to you?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.205
Yes, I found some limes
and lemons

06:45.238 --> 06:47.874
dehydrated down the side
of my, uh, chair.

06:47.907 --> 06:52.045
And bits of, uh,
tissue left on the, uh, table.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.413
Do you have
a cleaner in here?

06:53.446 --> 06:54.681
Yes, we do.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.182
Is she blind?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.000
Probably.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.387
Probably.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.055
Hey, you're not
doing nothing right now?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.657
I'm cleaning up
our stuff before--

07:03.690 --> 07:04.658
Get me a glass of ice water,
please.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.226
An ice water?
Yeah.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
Nylah, can I have
an ice water, please?

07:08.194 --> 07:09.362
Way to go.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.497
Two?

07:10.530 --> 07:11.665
She's standing
right there.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.200
Oh, my God.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.604
It's, um...zero for zero.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.140
15 minutes in--nothing.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.641
I'm starving.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.309
We got some appetizers
coming, right?

07:23.343 --> 07:24.310
What?

07:24.310 --> 07:26.012
Appetizers coming?

07:26.045 --> 07:28.047
It's cooking.

07:29.949 --> 07:30.000
Here's what snapped.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.984
Here's what snapped.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.085
Damn.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.422
We gotta get rid
of all these dirty dishes.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.224
This is killin' me.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.468
That's better.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.536
A proper seat.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.607
Just turn that one.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.708
Turn.
It's done.

07:55.741 --> 07:56.943
No, it's not--turn it!

07:56.976 --> 07:58.811
Why is the kitchen
so slow?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.684
Somebody wants me,
I'm out back.

08:04.717 --> 08:08.087
Past the half hour mark
now so, hey.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.022
Things are looking,
uh, hmm, a bit low.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.199
Hmm.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.038
Well, you got your
appetizers being made?

08:26.072 --> 08:27.039
Nope.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.240
Hey, what about
appetizers?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.609
They're all cooking.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.000
You wanna start
on those pizzas then?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.210
You wanna start
on those pizzas then?

08:31.243 --> 08:33.346
Just relax.
Take a chill.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.747
I might as well keep fit
and do something,

08:34.780 --> 08:35.681
hadn't I now?

08:35.715 --> 08:37.550
Go for a jog--
got a marathon coming up.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.052
Nothing wrong with
working off a lunch...

08:40.086 --> 08:42.121
When you get it.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.889
Do you have anything
on that last order ready?

08:43.923 --> 08:45.224
What's that?

08:45.257 --> 08:47.760
Anything on that last order
ready or close?

08:47.793 --> 08:49.662
No, we put everything
up at one time.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.863
We're just waiting for
the sandwich and the pizza.

08:50.896 --> 08:52.264
Have you got
one thing close?

08:52.298 --> 08:53.532
You want me to start--
If you got one thing close,
lay it out.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.001
Okay.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
Don't know why the
you wanna do that, but okay.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.000
Okay.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.773
Okay.

09:02.808 --> 09:03.976
We got the appetizers--
Oh,.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.045
Okay, great.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.047
I was nodding off then.
Huh?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.082
I was nodding off.
I know, I saw that.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.851
Thank you, my darling,
and that's stuffed with crab?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.185
Right.
Lovely.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.553
Thank you, my darling.
You're welcome.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.122
Wow.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.799
Soggy.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.100
Tasteless.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.702
There's no crab
or any form of flavor

09:29.735 --> 09:30.000
or texture or anything
in there.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.604
or texture or anything
in there.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.105
What worries me
more than anything,

09:33.139 --> 09:36.642
they're just full of water.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.714
How is everything?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.115
Uh, yeah, pretty vile.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.750
Um, are they frozen,
the mushrooms?

09:44.784 --> 09:46.385
Um...they should be
making them fresh.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.420
Really?
Yes.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.629
Didn't work.

09:56.662 --> 09:57.963
I told you.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.298
The, um...

09:59.331 --> 10:00.000
Stuffed mushrooms
that he got,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.167
Stuffed mushrooms
that he got,

10:01.200 --> 10:02.668
he could definitely tell--

10:02.702 --> 10:04.737
he said that it tasted
like it was frozen.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.006
And he didn't like those
at all, either.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.774
Deluxe pizza.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.142
What is that thing?

10:10.176 --> 10:12.445
What's that sandwich?

10:12.478 --> 10:13.479
That's an ugly sandwich.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.016
Yeah, no.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.217
I'm not worried
about him.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.852
Just see what he's got.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.220
If he wants to bitch
and moan, that's his drama.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.191
Here's the deluxe.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.159
And here's
your monte crisco.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.128
Thank you.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.000
Is that powdered sugar?

10:30.000 --> 10:30.229
Is that powdered sugar?

10:30.262 --> 10:31.897
Yes.
On the sandwich?

10:31.931 --> 10:32.998
Yes.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.133
With fries?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.401
Yes.

10:35.434 --> 10:36.502
Is that popular?

10:36.535 --> 10:37.536
No.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.109
It's actually dripping.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.447
Fat.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.216
Ew.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.852
When Chef Ramsay squeezed
the monte crisco

10:52.885 --> 10:56.021
and all that oil came out,
that really disgusted me.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.990
That was very disgusting.

10:58.023 --> 11:00.000
Pizza.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.526
Pizza.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.763
Maybe the best
is for last.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.103
Unfortunately...

11:11.137 --> 11:12.238
the dough is raw.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.873
So thick...

11:13.906 --> 11:16.242
It's like wallpaper paste--
raw.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.710
Oh, my God.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.545
And that's why...

11:19.578 --> 11:21.614
Clearly, there's nobody
in the restaurant.

11:21.647 --> 11:25.050
Because only people that can eat
this kind of

11:25.084 --> 11:27.586
are the ones in the bar...

11:27.620 --> 11:30.000
Drunk.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.122
Drunk.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.159
After a long wait
in an empty restaurant

11:33.192 --> 11:34.527
For some horrible food,

11:34.560 --> 11:36.896
Gordon gathers the staff...

11:36.929 --> 11:39.265
So you're the sous chef
and you're the head chef?

11:39.298 --> 11:42.001
To discuss the nightmare
that is Casa Roma.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.036
Lunch.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.671
Absolutely embarrassing.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.407
The fried sandwich...

11:48.441 --> 11:50.510
What planet are you on when you
put that  together?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.179
Casa Roma celebrates

11:53.212 --> 11:54.647
its 50th year this year.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.716
Yeah, I mean, what a
embarrassment.

11:59.852 --> 12:00.000
Erick, you knew
I was coming for lunch today.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.754
Erick, you knew
I was coming for lunch today.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.589
I didn't know when you--
whose you were.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.491
I said, "Which one is his?"
They wouldn't tell me.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.492
Ashley...

12:06.526 --> 12:08.061
You never asked which one.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.395
And it shouldn't matter

12:09.429 --> 12:10.730
If it was him or her
or whoever.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.598
It doesn't matter.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.034
I came here today, yeah,
to taste your best.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.636
Like any chef would do

12:16.669 --> 12:18.738
when they go into each other's
restaurants, yeah?

12:18.771 --> 12:20.640
I'm not here to ing
catch you off guard.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.076
So cut the  excuses
and give me some  respect

12:23.109 --> 12:24.510
for the restaurant alone!

12:24.544 --> 12:26.379
It was a bad
ing day, pal.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.880
Bad day?!
Now you're pushing it.
Enough.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.348
I get it.
We understand.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.000
A bad day?!

12:30.000 --> 12:30.383
A bad day?!

12:30.416 --> 12:31.617
Yeah,  happens.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.052
You never had a bad day?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.388
I do have bad days,
all the time.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.989
I'm obviously
having one today.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.191
Just relax,
take a chill pill.

12:38.224 --> 12:39.726
Reload and do it again.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.461
What the big problem is
with you, Erick,

12:41.494 --> 12:42.729
you've accepted it.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.197
In your opinion only.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.898
What?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.834
What part of that
don't you frickin' understand?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.602
What do you mean
"frickin' understand"?

12:49.635 --> 12:50.837
Yeah, what part of that
don't you understand?

12:50.870 --> 12:52.071
In your opinion only.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.439
I haven't accepted it.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.208
Yeah, and I
ed up stuff.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.776
Yeah, , so I try
and reload and redo it.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.778
There was nothing edible.

13:02.749 --> 13:03.983
Why are you
walking away, Erick?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.623
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares...

13:10.656 --> 13:12.558
This has to be one
of the worst restaurants

13:12.592 --> 13:14.627
I've ever seen
in my entire cooking career.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.330
Gordon takes on
an incompetent staff.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.532
Damn it, am I the only one
that in' works here?

13:19.565 --> 13:21.100
You haven't got a clue
what's going on.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.235
You're running around
crazy.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.569
We're spinning around.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.105
I need the door closed.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.308
And just when Gordon thinks
he's seen the worst of it...

13:30.576 --> 13:33.446
He goes where
he's never gone before:

13:33.479 --> 13:34.547
the bathroom.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.282
Look at that.

13:36.315 --> 13:40.186
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.858
Appalled by the food,

13:45.891 --> 13:47.659
Chef Ramsay's little chat
with head chef Erick

13:47.693 --> 13:49.661
didn't exactly
go over well.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.296
Lunch.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.699
Absolutely embarrassing.

13:53.732 --> 13:57.436
What planet are you on when you
put that  together?

13:57.469 --> 13:59.004
Why are you
walking away, Erick?

14:02.374 --> 14:05.477
I was in awe when Erick
talked to Chef Ramsay like that.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.514
He's coming here
to help us out.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.548
Don't be rude to him.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.483
You got two minutes?

14:11.517 --> 14:11.554
Two minutes?
I've got a week.

14:11.554 --> 14:14.253
Two minutes?
I've got a week.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.155
I'm not gonna give you
no excuses at all.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.724
All right?

14:18.757 --> 14:20.392
Long days.

14:20.425 --> 14:21.727
Haven't been
feeling 100%.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.794
But I'm here anyway.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.296
You do what
you gotta do.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.298
You work to try
and get these people better.

14:26.331 --> 14:28.567
Let me reload and we'll
see what we can do again.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.137
Okay, I think we got
caught flat-footed.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.739
But I get to reload
one time.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.340
I won't get caught
flat-footed again.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.675
You can bet your ass
on that.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.611
Sicilian Parmesan?

14:39.645 --> 14:40.846
Is that what we're writing?
Yep.

14:40.879 --> 14:41.554
C-e-c--

14:41.554 --> 14:41.847
C-e-c--

14:41.880 --> 14:42.848
S-a-n.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.883
Sicilian what?

14:44.917 --> 14:46.285
That's right.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.220
That isn't even how
you spell Sicilian.

14:48.253 --> 14:49.922
Doesn't anybody
know how to spell it?

14:49.955 --> 14:51.423
That might
be Celian.

14:51.456 --> 14:52.324
Sicilian's from Sicily.

14:52.357 --> 14:53.392
Really?

14:53.425 --> 14:55.060
'Cause S-i-c-i-l-y.

14:55.093 --> 14:56.361
I don't think there'd
be a "y."

14:56.395 --> 14:57.896
No, it's i-n.

14:57.930 --> 14:58.931
Sicilian.

14:58.964 --> 15:00.065
There we go.

15:00.098 --> 15:01.600
Thank God you guys
sawthat.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.540
Uh, do you work here
or you just bypassing?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.542
Come round,
so we can say hello.

15:12.377 --> 15:13.612
This is...
Jimmy.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.480
Jimmy.
And what do you do?

15:15.514 --> 15:16.915
Um, I'm the son
of the owners.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.884
I said what
do you do?

15:18.917 --> 15:20.319
Little bit of everything.
Uh-huh.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.820
Just try and help out.

15:21.853 --> 15:24.122
You're--what's that
in there?

15:24.156 --> 15:25.157
Cranberry juice.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.325
Cranberry juice?
Mm-hmm.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.559
Nice.
Little vodka.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.961
Vodka and cranberry juice?
Yes, yes.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.163
So you drink and work
at the same time.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.497
No, I don't work.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.599
Oh, you're not working?

15:33.632 --> 15:35.133
No, no.
Okay, right.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.002
So what do you do then
outside of here?

15:37.035 --> 15:38.337
What's your job?
What's your career?

15:38.370 --> 15:39.338
I do construction.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.672
Construction.
Operate heavy machinery.

15:40.706 --> 15:41.554
Okay, so no one's
got any cooking

15:41.554 --> 15:41.573
Okay, so no one's
got any cooking

15:41.607 --> 15:42.608
or restaurant experience?

15:42.641 --> 15:43.609
No, no.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.644
Ah.
Not at all.

15:45.677 --> 15:46.712
Excellent.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.251
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.785
Put your chair here,
and I'll put one on the end.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.587
I'm having
the chicken parmesan.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.989
He's gonna have the chicken
nuggets and fries.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.057
Okay, I got
calamari to start,

15:59.091 --> 16:00.859
and then kids' chicken nuggets
with fries.

16:00.892 --> 16:03.195
Excuse me?

16:03.228 --> 16:04.963
Do you have any questions
about the order?

16:04.997 --> 16:06.465
Kids spaghetti alfredo,
shrimp scampi.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.400
Chicken parm.
Marinara--okay.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.554
Erick, you want me
to saute, man?

16:11.554 --> 16:12.004
Erick, you want me
to saute, man?

16:14.039 --> 16:15.841
You want me to saute?

16:15.874 --> 16:17.776
Erick and I do not
get along in the kitchen

16:17.809 --> 16:20.012
because we don't really
communicate very well.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.947
Would you prefer
working on your own?

16:21.980 --> 16:24.016
Mm, sometimes, yeah.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.284
I can tell.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.485
Why is that?

16:26.518 --> 16:27.919
'Cause you're not
saying anything.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.288
Just doing
what I gotta do.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.589
Yeah. Oh, dear.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.693
Here's your
stuffed mushrooms.

16:34.726 --> 16:35.894
You're welcome.

16:35.927 --> 16:37.596
You dig in.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.554
Is it cooked, you think?

16:41.554 --> 16:42.501
Is it cooked, you think?

16:42.534 --> 16:43.702
Yours--no.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.204
You send that back.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.140
This sausage
is not done.

16:50.942 --> 16:53.412
Erick, this sausage
isn't done.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.550
I ain't got time
for this.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.319
It looks like
it's frozen.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.554
I'm sorry
about that, guys.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.456
Working here
is life for us.

17:04.489 --> 17:05.991
It's what pays our bills.

17:06.024 --> 17:09.094
And to know that the cook

17:09.127 --> 17:11.554
is keeping us
from making money,

17:11.554 --> 17:11.897
is keeping us
from making money,

17:11.930 --> 17:13.231
it's hard on us.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.833
What was wrong
with the calamari?

17:14.866 --> 17:16.635
Uh, what happened to
the calamari that's come back?

17:16.668 --> 17:17.969
They said that it tastes
like it was frozen.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.171
Is this normal?
Yes.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.306
Yeah.
What can you do?

17:21.340 --> 17:25.410
Drew, I need 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 chicken breasts, Drew.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.580
Erick doesn't ever really push
to get it done.

17:28.613 --> 17:31.817
He just keeps telling me,
"Oh, it's okay, I got it.

17:31.850 --> 17:32.918
Everything's gonna be fine."

17:32.951 --> 17:34.586
But it's not.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.089
Did you get the lasagna,
Drew, or no?

17:37.122 --> 17:39.424
Damn it, am I the only one
that in' works here?

17:43.161 --> 17:44.830
It's an hour
into dinner service,

17:44.863 --> 17:46.565
and several appetizers

17:46.598 --> 17:48.166
are getting sent back
to the kitchen.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.135
Yeah, that can...
go back.

17:50.168 --> 17:53.405
And only one table
has received its entrees.

17:53.438 --> 17:55.607
That's probably the worst
shrimp scampi

17:55.640 --> 17:57.609
that I've ever had
in my entire life.

17:57.642 --> 17:59.745
Let me take it back to the chef
and explain it to him.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.046
Thank you very much.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.347
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.217
Okay, guys, listen.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.918
Worst shrimp scampi
they ever had,

18:06.952 --> 18:08.754
and they said
no flavor at all.

18:08.787 --> 18:09.988
Well, what can you do?

18:10.021 --> 18:11.554
Get me some water, Jimmy.

18:11.554 --> 18:11.823
Get me some water, Jimmy.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.026
When food comes back
like that

18:15.060 --> 18:16.762
with the shrimps,
you never taste it?

18:16.795 --> 18:18.830
You know,
what can you do?

18:20.165 --> 18:21.733
I've never seen two cooks
so far apart from each other

18:21.767 --> 18:22.768
up until now.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.203
I get frustrated, but...

18:25.237 --> 18:26.872
I try not
to get angry at people.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.273
You know?

18:28.306 --> 18:30.008
Everybody says
I'm  anyway.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.344
So why should I
perpetuate the problem

18:32.377 --> 18:33.678
that's not necessary?

18:33.712 --> 18:35.280
But you need help.

18:35.313 --> 18:36.982
If you don't get help,
we're gonna be in the

18:37.015 --> 18:37.916
The next 10 or 15 minutes, no?

18:37.949 --> 18:39.184
Is it really
8:30 already?
It's true.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.552
We've been here
for two hours,

18:40.585 --> 18:41.453
and we haven't even
got our food?

18:41.486 --> 18:41.554
Is this normal?

18:41.554 --> 18:42.454
Is this normal?

18:42.487 --> 18:43.588
This is  normal.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.459
This...is incredible.

18:47.492 --> 18:48.794
Right through those doors

18:48.827 --> 18:50.629
has to be, to me,

18:50.662 --> 18:52.230
one of the worst restaurants

18:52.264 --> 18:53.899
I've ever seen
in my entire cooking career.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.434
The chef doesn't
give a.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.968
The owner's
completely clueless.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.603
And not any form
of communication

18:58.637 --> 18:59.971
between the kitchen,

19:00.005 --> 19:01.106
the restaurant,
and the management.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.074
It's a  shambles.

19:10.916 --> 19:11.554
What are you waiting on,
Ashley?

19:11.554 --> 19:12.217
What are you waiting on,
Ashley?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.985
I'm still waiting on...

19:14.019 --> 19:16.788
Chicken piccata
with penne marinara,

19:16.822 --> 19:18.623
an individual kids'
pepperoni pizza,

19:18.657 --> 19:20.258
a half order of
spaghetti with meat sauce,

19:20.292 --> 19:22.294
eggplant Parmesan
with angel and meat,

19:22.327 --> 19:24.596
chicken piccata,
angel with marinara,

19:24.629 --> 19:26.031
three chicken parms,

19:26.064 --> 19:27.332
and a veal parmesan.

19:27.365 --> 19:29.201
For just one table.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.669
I felt like crying,

19:30.702 --> 19:32.537
'cause it was
that embarrassing for me.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.039
Erick.
Yes, sir?

19:34.072 --> 19:35.640
Yeah, can I have
your undivided attention?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.409
Sure.
Nothing's happening.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.077
We've served one table of four,
one table of two

19:39.110 --> 19:41.546
for the last three tickets,
half the order's gone out,

19:41.580 --> 19:43.048
half is still on the board.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.850
You haven't got a clue
what's going on.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.151
You're running around
crazy.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.419
What chance have we got

19:47.452 --> 19:51.456
serving 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 tables?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.725
You asked for one more crack
at lunchtime.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.360
"Let me go, big boy.
Let me go, I wanna do it again."

19:55.393 --> 19:56.795
We're spinning around

19:56.828 --> 19:58.196
and serving.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.397
Do me a favor.

19:59.431 --> 20:00.932
Close the ing
restaurant.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.601
I can't stand any longer

20:02.634 --> 20:04.369
and watch
that embarrassment.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.409
As of now,
we're not gonna be

20:11.443 --> 20:11.554
serving any more
dinners tonight.

20:11.554 --> 20:13.111
serving any more
dinners tonight.

20:13.144 --> 20:16.114
I need the door
ing closed.

20:16.147 --> 20:17.349
Forget it!
All right.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.817
We're done
for the night.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.787
This is a joke, guys!

20:25.323 --> 20:26.892
Forget it!
Good night!

20:27.993 --> 20:29.861
What restaurant
stops their business

20:29.895 --> 20:32.664
and tells everybody
that they have to leave?

20:34.199 --> 20:35.667
There's no excuse.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.547
At a point in the service

20:48.581 --> 20:50.649
when more food was being
returned than sent out...

20:50.683 --> 20:53.652
I need the door
ing closed.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.854
Gordon shut down
the restaurant...

20:55.888 --> 20:57.489
As of now,
we're not gonna be

20:57.523 --> 20:59.625
serving any more dinners
tonight.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.193
And confronted the chefs about
the problems in the kitchen.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.662
This is a joke, guys!

21:03.696 --> 21:05.531
Forget it!
Good night!

21:05.564 --> 21:07.800
It's now time for the cold,
hard facts

21:07.833 --> 21:09.101
With owner Nylah.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.502
I don't even know
where to start

21:10.536 --> 21:12.004
with a 50-year-old chef

21:12.037 --> 21:13.676
that can't even
cook something basic.

21:13.676 --> 21:13.973
that can't even
cook something basic.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.508
Why are you employing
a chef that is that incompetent?

21:16.542 --> 21:19.245
Darling, he's not
in the slightest bit interested

21:19.278 --> 21:21.013
in ing
making it work.

21:21.046 --> 21:22.348
He doesn't give a
about his cooking.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.049
Doesn't give
a  about you.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.450
And he's here for one thing
and one thing only:

21:25.483 --> 21:27.185
paycheck.
money.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.021
And the only restaurant
that in' guy

21:29.054 --> 21:30.656
will ever get a job

21:30.689 --> 21:34.092
is in a restaurant that
doesn't have any customers.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.195
If you've got any chance
of surviving here,

21:36.228 --> 21:38.430
get rid of him.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.165
What are you scared of?
Talk to me.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.566
Nothing.
There's gotta
be something.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.767
Where am I gonna--
I need to find another chef.

21:42.801 --> 21:43.676
So Drew,
what's wrong with Drew?

21:43.676 --> 21:44.302
So Drew,
what's wrong with Drew?

21:44.336 --> 21:45.871
Drew, I think,
can carry it off.

21:45.904 --> 21:48.406
So get rid of him.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.741
Okay.

21:49.774 --> 21:52.010
Let's go.

21:52.043 --> 21:53.778
me.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.914
Un-ing believable.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.917
Hey.
Come here.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.385
I'm sorry.
I know.

22:00.418 --> 22:02.053
No, you don't know.
I feel bad.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.689
Just wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.

22:03.722 --> 22:04.356
Jeremy, come here.
I feel bad.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.158
I feel real bad.

22:09.294 --> 22:10.863
But the whole thing is,

22:10.896 --> 22:12.831
this isn't the first time
you've let us down.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.676
I don't know
what's going on.
I just can't do it.

22:13.676 --> 22:14.232
I don't know
what's going on.
I just can't do it.

22:14.265 --> 22:15.166
I know, but I can't do it.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.534
Erick, I gotta make--

22:16.568 --> 22:18.269
you guys get your
paycheck every week.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.771
Jeremy and I never
take a dime out of here.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.706
We understand that.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.307
I know, but I mean--

22:22.341 --> 22:23.809
the whole thing's
just not gonna work.

22:23.842 --> 22:24.977
Because you--

22:25.010 --> 22:26.278
Okay, so what
do you wanna do?

22:26.311 --> 22:27.813
I--we're
gonna part ways.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.249
Okay, no problem.
Okay.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.316
Damn it.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.018
I got a in'
bad deal.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.090
He couldn't pull off lunch,

22:38.123 --> 22:39.658
couldn't pull off dinner.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.928
And so...
We just had to let him go.

22:42.961 --> 22:43.676
I can't, you know,
I can't do this.

22:43.676 --> 22:45.831
I can't, you know,
I can't do this.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.167
With head chef Erick gone,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.335
Gordon is hoping
sous chef Drew

22:50.335 --> 22:51.669
can rise to the occasion.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.271
That was a tough one
tonight.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.406
Oh, very much so.
Yeah, yeah, very tough.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.307
Don't get down
in the dumps.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.775
Tonight was...
clearly,

22:56.808 --> 22:58.043
at its best.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.445
But...you don't need me
telling you that.

23:00.478 --> 23:02.213
'Cause that
was embarrassing.
Very much.

23:02.247 --> 23:03.515
Yeah, is that
how you run it?

23:03.548 --> 23:04.683
Hell, no.
Good.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.084
Tomorrow we go again.

23:06.117 --> 23:07.352
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.386
I need you.
All right.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.654
Yes?
Thank you.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.323
Good night.
Good night.

23:11.356 --> 23:13.124
I'm glad Erick's not
in our kitchen anymore,

23:13.125 --> 23:13.676
because maybe it'll give me
an opportunity

23:13.676 --> 23:14.760
because maybe it'll give me
an opportunity

23:14.793 --> 23:16.161
to step up and do something.

23:16.194 --> 23:19.631
Okay, that was embarrassing.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.300
Not only a bad morning,
but a bad evening.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.735
For every plate

23:22.768 --> 23:24.570
we put out there
this evening,

23:24.603 --> 23:26.739
we were losing what little
reputation we had left

23:26.772 --> 23:28.507
to salvage this place.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.542
What chance would we have of
getting all those tickets out?

23:30.576 --> 23:31.844
There was no chance.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.013
To put it bluntly,
that chef--

23:34.046 --> 23:37.383
possibly the worst chef
in America today.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.685
To quickly put a man like that
out of his misery

23:39.718 --> 23:41.520
is the biggest favor
you've done for him

23:41.553 --> 23:43.676
and the restaurant.

23:43.676 --> 23:44.023
and the restaurant.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.025
Okay, tomorrow's a new day.
I've got Drew.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.327
That's what I've got left
to work with.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.495
What's his strengths?

23:49.528 --> 23:51.597
Uh, I would
say pizzas.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.831
Calzones.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.867
Um, his lasagna is awesome.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.102
All right, Drew

23:57.136 --> 23:59.138
is the only saving grace
I've got there.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.940
I'm gonna work with him
tomorrow.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.608
I'm gonna be
by his side tomorrow

24:02.641 --> 24:04.476
to start from scratch.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.612
Okay?

24:06.645 --> 24:07.613
Good night.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.214
Thank you.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.283
I think Drew will step up.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.676
And I think if he gets
some confidence behind him,

24:13.676 --> 24:14.186
And I think if he gets
some confidence behind him,

24:14.219 --> 24:16.121
I think he can do it.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.763
Last 24 hours is one of
the toughest days ever spent

24:24.797 --> 24:26.131
in a restaurant.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.700
Last night, we did
get rid of the chef,

24:27.733 --> 24:29.201
which was a positive move.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.970
Now I need Drew
to step up to the mark

24:31.003 --> 24:32.338
and Jeremy to support
his mother more.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.906
I got here
early this morning,

24:33.939 --> 24:35.207
so I'm gonna check out
the place properly

24:35.240 --> 24:36.542
with no interference.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.520
Where do you start
in a place like this?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.360
Roast beef.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.495
Dating back when?

24:56.528 --> 24:58.897
And what in the hell
is that there?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.633
Just meat defrosting.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.535
Again, no sign
of what it is.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.571
Fresh Parma ham.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.306
It's caked in mold.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.242
This is outrageous.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.445
Look at it.

25:13.479 --> 25:13.676
It sticks to your
ing hand.

25:13.676 --> 25:15.481
It sticks to your
ing hand.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.449
It's that rancid.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.254
Ugh.  Hell.

25:24.490 --> 25:28.060
That's just over
three months old.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.267
God.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.878
after witnessing one
of the worst kitchen walk-ins

25:52.911 --> 25:54.446
he has ever seen,

25:54.479 --> 25:56.682
Gordon moves on to an area
outside the kitchen

25:56.715 --> 25:58.517
that restaurants
are judged upon:

25:58.550 --> 26:00.218
The bathroom.

26:00.252 --> 26:02.521
One of the best ways to check
the hygiene of any restaurant

26:02.554 --> 26:04.189
is always through
its bathrooms.

26:04.222 --> 26:07.125
Turn that on
and turn the lights off.

26:07.159 --> 26:08.560
Right.

26:08.593 --> 26:11.096
This could be quite scary.

26:11.129 --> 26:14.499
Oh, my good God.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.779
Green and yellow identifies
bodily fluids.

26:16.779 --> 26:18.570
Green and yellow identifies
bodily fluids.

26:18.603 --> 26:20.605
Any form of bleach
or any form of cleaning

26:20.639 --> 26:22.641
will be identified
through the color blue.

26:22.674 --> 26:26.278
But the bodily fluids on here
is extraordinary.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.182
Look--as high as the ceiling.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.117
Oh, my God.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.052
Even the ceiling's
caked in it.

26:34.086 --> 26:36.388
Oh, my God.

26:36.421 --> 26:38.724
This is shocking.

26:38.757 --> 26:40.792
"Wash your hands."

26:40.826 --> 26:41.927
Yeah.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.763
Honestly, I've seen enough.

26:44.796 --> 26:46.779
Let's get the
out of here.

26:46.779 --> 26:47.466
Let's get the
out of here.

26:51.703 --> 26:54.139
Disappointed by the state
of the restaurant,

26:54.172 --> 26:56.608
Gordon is concerned about
the family's commitment

26:56.641 --> 26:58.510
to its own restaurant.

26:58.543 --> 27:00.345
Right, got in early
this morning.

27:00.379 --> 27:03.081
It's like a new day,
and...

27:03.115 --> 27:05.317
I'm somewhat...

27:05.350 --> 27:06.718
not just confused,

27:06.752 --> 27:08.153
but disappointed, yeah?

27:08.186 --> 27:09.454
Come with me.
Let me show you something.

27:15.694 --> 27:16.779
How old is that?

27:16.779 --> 27:16.995
How old is that?

27:17.029 --> 27:18.096
Uh, Tuesday.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.531
Tuesday?!

27:19.564 --> 27:21.199
Aw, come on, guys.

27:21.233 --> 27:24.236
How old is this?

27:24.269 --> 27:26.271
Well, hold it
and smell it.

27:26.304 --> 27:27.372
Touch it!

27:27.406 --> 27:28.640
It's sticky.
Uck.

27:28.673 --> 27:30.075
Let's come outside.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.010
The walk-in is just
rubbish, really.

27:32.044 --> 27:33.578
It looks like.

27:33.612 --> 27:35.447
It's horrible, it's old.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.482
It's probably about as old
as Erick.

27:37.516 --> 27:40.085
This is the killer for me!

27:40.118 --> 27:41.953
Pass it round.

27:41.987 --> 27:43.789
It's three months old!

27:44.890 --> 27:46.258
And then, look,

27:46.291 --> 27:46.779
only in California.

27:46.779 --> 27:47.659
only in California.

27:49.528 --> 27:52.297
What...In the
is that?

27:53.465 --> 27:55.567
Made me sick.
I hated to see it.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.569
We talk about cleaning out
the refrigerator,

27:57.602 --> 27:59.738
making sure things are clean
all the time.

27:59.771 --> 28:02.140
And, to my surprise,
they aren't.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.375
Nylah, the state
of that fridge in there

28:04.376 --> 28:06.678
confirms whoever's
running this place

28:06.711 --> 28:09.614
in terms of kitchen management
has given up.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.416
They don't give a
about you

28:11.449 --> 28:12.951
And they don't give a
about standards.

28:12.984 --> 28:14.853
I went into the bathroom.

28:14.886 --> 28:16.779
And that's where
it got worse.

28:16.779 --> 28:16.821
And that's where
it got worse.

28:16.855 --> 28:17.956
I need two minutes with you.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.090
Okay.

28:19.124 --> 28:21.026
You start
taking that out, yeah?

28:21.059 --> 28:22.627
And, hey,
get a bin,

28:22.660 --> 28:25.497
and get every ounce of dirt
out of there.

28:27.432 --> 28:30.735
Having a dirty refrigeration
unit is one thing.

28:30.769 --> 28:33.471
Having a filthy bathroom
is something that

28:33.505 --> 28:35.473
scares the hell
out of me.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.142
This thing here

28:37.175 --> 28:38.376
detects body fluids.

28:38.410 --> 28:42.347
Just have
a look at this.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.049
That's body fluids up there?

28:44.082 --> 28:46.779
That there
has got nothing to do

28:46.779 --> 28:47.452
That there
has got nothing to do

28:47.485 --> 28:48.953
with any form of cleaning.

28:48.987 --> 28:53.124
Look at the  state
of this.

28:53.158 --> 28:56.528
Green, green, green,
green, green.

28:56.561 --> 28:58.663
Here's where it
gets really scary.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.832
How the hell
did it get up there?

29:00.865 --> 29:03.134
It looked like somebody may have
peed on the ceiling,

29:03.168 --> 29:05.203
the walls, the doors.

29:05.236 --> 29:07.305
You know.

29:07.338 --> 29:08.406
Could be throw-up.

29:10.442 --> 29:12.544
It made me sick--I didn't even
want to touch the doorknob

29:12.577 --> 29:14.112
coming out myself.

29:14.145 --> 29:15.580
Bring your son in, yeah.
I'm not going in there.

29:15.613 --> 29:16.779
My God.

29:16.779 --> 29:17.849
My God.

29:17.882 --> 29:20.919
This is body fluids.

29:20.952 --> 29:22.287
Body fluids on the ceiling?

29:22.320 --> 29:23.354
Uh-huh.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.156
People are peeing.

29:25.156 --> 29:26.157
Up on the ceiling?

29:26.190 --> 29:27.658
Well, maybe.

29:27.691 --> 29:30.995
As Nylah shows her sons
the bathrooms,

29:31.028 --> 29:34.298
Gordon's inspection continues
at the kitchen prep area.

29:34.331 --> 29:36.500
What in the
is going on here?

29:36.534 --> 29:38.636
It just shows
that there's no bleach.

29:38.669 --> 29:40.604
You know, these walls probably
haven't been washed.

29:40.638 --> 29:42.740
Oh, God.

29:42.773 --> 29:44.642
What in the
are they?

29:44.675 --> 29:46.010
Look at that there.

29:46.043 --> 29:46.779
Holy bleep.

29:46.779 --> 29:48.279
Holy bleep.

29:48.312 --> 29:49.747
Jimmy!

29:49.780 --> 29:50.614
People ing
on the ceiling.

29:50.648 --> 29:51.582
What?

29:51.615 --> 29:53.784
What is that?

29:53.818 --> 29:55.619
I supposed
it's meatballs.

29:55.653 --> 29:56.954
Good God.

29:58.989 --> 30:00.658
Have a look.

30:00.691 --> 30:03.360
Those are from
Super Bowl Sunday.

30:03.394 --> 30:05.262
Super Bowl Sunday?
Yes.

30:06.964 --> 30:08.299
What is that?

30:08.332 --> 30:09.900
That looks like
raviolis.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.636
What?
Soaking in water.

30:12.670 --> 30:13.637
Uck.

30:13.671 --> 30:15.372
I need to start
stepping up,

30:15.406 --> 30:16.779
taking the reins,
taking control.

30:16.779 --> 30:17.675
taking the reins,
taking control.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.844
And doing what I need to do.

30:19.877 --> 30:22.113
My big worry is

30:22.146 --> 30:24.215
this is not
difficult to spot.

30:24.248 --> 30:27.251
You could spend ten minutes
after every night's service

30:27.284 --> 30:28.886
behind the bar,

30:28.919 --> 30:30.955
walking through
the kitchen,

30:30.988 --> 30:32.823
and turning this place
upside down.

30:32.857 --> 30:34.992
And you don't need to be
a  rocket scientist

30:35.025 --> 30:36.093
to understand

30:36.127 --> 30:37.294
that this place

30:37.328 --> 30:40.097
is in desperate need
of support.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.432
Before I go any further,

30:41.465 --> 30:43.234
I want the in'
place clean.

30:44.702 --> 30:45.803
me.

30:54.813 --> 30:56.748
After a full day of cleaning,

30:56.781 --> 30:57.682
Gordon realizes
that if there is any chance

30:57.716 --> 30:59.250
of relaunching
this restaurant,

30:59.284 --> 31:01.186
he has to turn his attention
to Chef Drew.

31:01.219 --> 31:02.620
Drew, right now,

31:02.654 --> 31:04.489
I want you and I
to go and cook some pizzas.

31:04.522 --> 31:05.890
And I'd like Jeremy
and Nylah to taste them.

31:05.924 --> 31:07.959
I've got a little
trick up my sleeve.

31:07.993 --> 31:11.262
This is a secret
between you and I.

31:11.296 --> 31:12.263
Okay.

31:12.297 --> 31:13.698
Okay, I wanna find out

31:13.732 --> 31:15.533
if they can actually
tell the difference

31:15.567 --> 31:18.837
between a frozen pizza

31:18.870 --> 31:20.105
to something freshly made.

31:20.138 --> 31:21.072
That goes in.

31:21.106 --> 31:22.474
Okay.

31:22.507 --> 31:22.818
Array of ingredients.

31:22.818 --> 31:23.775
Array of ingredients.

31:23.808 --> 31:25.110
Fresh, vibrant, exciting.

31:25.143 --> 31:26.511
Let your imagination go wild

31:26.544 --> 31:28.747
and create
the ultimate pizza.

31:28.780 --> 31:29.881
Okay? Let's go.

31:31.316 --> 31:33.084
Who's the chef
of this place?

31:33.118 --> 31:35.387
I guess I am now.
That's right.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.355
While Drew creates his own
signature thick-crust pizza,

31:37.389 --> 31:39.758
Gordon is preparing a special
thin-crust pizza

31:39.791 --> 31:41.659
that will be
on Casa Roma's new menu.

31:41.693 --> 31:42.694
Lovely.

31:42.727 --> 31:44.429
Working with Chef Ramsay

31:44.462 --> 31:46.197
Was, like,
one of the best things ever.

31:46.231 --> 31:47.599
Like, oh, my God,

31:47.632 --> 31:49.367
I just worked
with a world-class chef.

31:49.401 --> 31:50.835
Frozen pizza.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.818
And yours.
Right--ready?

31:52.818 --> 31:53.004
And yours.
Right--ready?

31:53.038 --> 31:54.439
Uh-huh.
Nice.

31:56.474 --> 31:58.009
Okay.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.377
So two nice pizzas.

31:59.411 --> 32:00.712
We're gonna be
looking for a verdict

32:00.745 --> 32:01.746
on both these.

32:06.951 --> 32:08.186
I mean, I like this one.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.021
Mm-hmm, good.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.656
Same.
Jeremy, pick one
as well.

32:11.689 --> 32:13.024
Yeah.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.959
I'm so glad you chose
that one there.

32:14.993 --> 32:17.262
Because this one here
was frozen,

32:17.295 --> 32:18.329
cheap.

32:18.363 --> 32:19.798
I was shocked when Chef Ramsay

32:19.831 --> 32:21.833
told me the one pizza
was frozen.

32:21.866 --> 32:22.818
'Cause I thought it tasted
a lot like our pizza we have.

32:22.818 --> 32:24.335
'Cause I thought it tasted
a lot like our pizza we have.

32:24.369 --> 32:27.272
The good news is,
both of you know your pizzas.

32:27.305 --> 32:28.573
Now let me get you
my pizza.

32:28.606 --> 32:29.607
This is a thin crust.

32:29.641 --> 32:30.975
I like this too.

32:31.009 --> 32:32.911
These two...
Mm-hmm.

32:32.944 --> 32:34.379
Are the type of pizzas
that should be on your menus.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.381
We are gonna
relaunch this restaurant,

32:36.414 --> 32:38.483
and we're gonna
shout from the rooftops

32:38.516 --> 32:40.452
how good these pizzas are.

32:40.485 --> 32:41.486
I'm happy.

32:41.519 --> 32:43.188
Well done.
Very nice.

32:47.659 --> 32:50.128
In order to transform
Casa Roma,

32:50.161 --> 32:52.197
Gordon and his team
needed a full day

32:52.230 --> 32:52.818
to turn this broken-down
Italian restaurant

32:52.818 --> 32:54.766
to turn this broken-down
Italian restaurant

32:54.799 --> 32:56.468
into a contemporary pizzeria.

32:57.702 --> 32:59.304
Nice to see you guys.

32:59.337 --> 33:00.405
How we feeling?

33:00.438 --> 33:01.406
Nervous!
Nervous.

33:01.439 --> 33:02.574
Nervous?

33:02.607 --> 33:05.577
Just have a look
at the new decor

33:05.610 --> 33:07.779
of the outside
of the new Casa Roma.

33:07.812 --> 33:09.080
Take off your blindfolds!

33:09.114 --> 33:10.281
Wow!

33:10.315 --> 33:12.016
Nice, new colors.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.285
The concrete jungle
is gone, yes?

33:14.319 --> 33:16.387
The Italian flag.

33:16.421 --> 33:18.256
We've got the most amazing
Casa Roma Pizzeria.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.624
Oh, my God.

33:19.657 --> 33:21.126
But look at the windows.

33:21.159 --> 33:22.293
It felt like we were
in prison before.

33:22.327 --> 33:22.818
Now it's more inviting, yes?

33:22.818 --> 33:24.229
Now it's more inviting, yes?

33:24.262 --> 33:26.231
Are we ready to see
the new interior?

33:26.264 --> 33:27.398
Let's go.

33:27.432 --> 33:28.800
Come through.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.068
Come through,
come through, come through.

33:30.101 --> 33:31.136
Come through.

33:31.169 --> 33:33.638
Ohh, look at this!

33:33.671 --> 33:35.073
Oh, my God!

33:35.106 --> 33:37.642
I was shocked beyond shocked.

33:37.675 --> 33:39.477
It looked like a bright,
new pizzeria.

33:39.511 --> 33:42.547
We got a nice, new,
dry pizzeria.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.315
Carpets are gone!

33:44.349 --> 33:45.750
The booths have gone!

33:45.783 --> 33:48.219
Chairs realigned.
New colors.

33:48.253 --> 33:49.787
I love it.

33:49.821 --> 33:52.357
And the restaurant has been
painted from top to bottom.

33:52.390 --> 33:52.818
Oh, look
at those floors!

33:52.818 --> 33:53.658
Oh, look
at those floors!

33:53.691 --> 33:54.792
I know!

33:54.826 --> 33:56.194
No more hideous rugs.

33:56.227 --> 33:56.861
No more carpets to clean.

33:56.895 --> 33:58.062
Just nice.

33:58.096 --> 33:59.764
Come through.
Look.

33:59.797 --> 34:01.332
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

34:01.366 --> 34:03.334
Look at these new chairs.

34:03.368 --> 34:06.604
The bar has been sanded
and stained twice, rather nice.

34:06.638 --> 34:09.974
And now we have
a theme coming through, yes?

34:10.008 --> 34:12.443
We were trying to be
fine dining,

34:12.477 --> 34:13.945
and then we had the bar,

34:13.978 --> 34:15.280
and it was like
two different countries.

34:15.313 --> 34:18.249
Now it's all
blended together

34:18.283 --> 34:19.751
and we're one big pizzeria

34:19.784 --> 34:21.085
and everybody can come
and have fun now.

34:21.119 --> 34:22.818
This place needs

34:22.818 --> 34:22.921
This place needs

34:22.954 --> 34:24.889
to celebrate its 50th year

34:24.923 --> 34:26.090
with a comeback.

34:26.124 --> 34:27.559
We are gonna hold

34:27.592 --> 34:31.629
the first annual Casa Roma
Pizza-eating Contest.

34:31.663 --> 34:32.997
Yeah, thank you.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.032
I love this.

34:34.065 --> 34:34.999
I love this.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.301
Mwah!

34:36.334 --> 34:38.002
I'm glad
you're happy.

34:38.036 --> 34:40.905
Thank you so much.

34:40.939 --> 34:43.208
In recent years,

34:43.241 --> 34:45.343
The community's perception
of Casa Roma

34:45.376 --> 34:48.479
is as a bar with an inferior
Italian restaurant attached.

34:50.615 --> 34:52.818
Gordon knows this restaurant
now has to reintroduce itself

34:52.818 --> 34:53.351
Gordon knows this restaurant
now has to reintroduce itself

34:53.384 --> 34:55.553
as the new happening
pizzeria in town.

34:55.587 --> 34:57.755
Thank you very much indeed.

34:57.789 --> 34:59.324
Welcome to the first-ever

34:59.357 --> 35:01.426
Casa Roma Pizza-eating
Challenge.

35:01.459 --> 35:03.695
Excellent.

35:03.728 --> 35:06.097
It was great to see that many
people supporting us today

35:06.130 --> 35:09.100
And actually getting out
and being part of the relaunch.

35:09.133 --> 35:10.635
Okay, contestants,

35:10.668 --> 35:11.869
are we hungry?

35:11.903 --> 35:13.771
Yes.
Are we ready?

35:16.507 --> 35:17.809
Five minutes.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.711
On your marks, eat!

35:19.744 --> 35:21.512
Let's go!

35:26.784 --> 35:28.086
Come on, guys!

35:28.119 --> 35:29.821
Take some water, it goes down
a lot easier.

35:29.854 --> 35:30.822
I can't do it.

35:30.855 --> 35:31.856
Come on, Jimmy!

35:31.889 --> 35:33.424
I can't eat that much.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.027
Jeremy is substituting
for Jimmy!

35:38.596 --> 35:40.265
Squoosh 'em in, come on!

35:40.298 --> 35:42.767
Piz-za! Piz-za! Piz-za!

35:42.800 --> 35:45.403
3, 2, 1.

35:45.436 --> 35:47.438
Stop! Yes!

35:48.773 --> 35:50.508
We have a winner,

35:50.541 --> 35:51.843
ladies and gentlemen.

35:51.876 --> 35:52.818
Congratulations to Jose!

35:52.818 --> 35:54.545
Congratulations to Jose!

35:56.714 --> 35:59.250
The pizza-eating contest
was definitely a fun way

35:59.284 --> 36:00.451
of spreading the word

36:00.485 --> 36:02.220
that Casa Roma has changed.

36:02.253 --> 36:04.622
There's a new look to it
and there's a new menu.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.190
Give it up, please.

36:06.224 --> 36:08.159
Round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen, yes.

36:10.862 --> 36:12.897
Four hours prior to relaunch,

36:12.930 --> 36:14.866
Gordon goes over
the new dishes.

36:14.899 --> 36:18.336
This is doable, uncomplicated,

36:18.369 --> 36:21.906
Nothing frozen,
and freshly home-baked pizzas.

36:21.939 --> 36:22.818
Wow.

36:22.818 --> 36:23.141
Wow.

36:23.174 --> 36:24.409
Chicken wings,

36:24.442 --> 36:25.810
served with
a cherry pepper sauce.

36:25.843 --> 36:27.445
Stuffed mushrooms,

36:27.478 --> 36:28.579
for the house specialty,

36:28.613 --> 36:30.281
bruschetta--simple.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.384
Look at it.
It's a lot more condensed, yeah?

36:33.418 --> 36:35.586
It's cooked to order,
it's fresh.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.088
Okay, good.
Get familiar with the food.

36:37.121 --> 36:38.289
Have a little taste.

36:38.323 --> 36:40.224
The menu is easier,
it's lighter.

36:40.258 --> 36:42.360
It's more sufficient.
It should be great.

36:42.393 --> 36:43.394
That was good, huh?

36:43.428 --> 36:44.562
That's crazy.

36:44.595 --> 36:45.797
Tonight...

36:45.830 --> 36:47.298
Honestly,

36:47.332 --> 36:49.067
for me is one of
the most important nights

36:49.100 --> 36:50.201
in 50 years.

36:50.234 --> 36:51.436
We gotta make our mark.

36:51.469 --> 36:52.637
- Yes?
- Yes.

36:52.670 --> 36:52.818
Absolutely.

36:52.818 --> 36:53.671
Absolutely.

36:53.705 --> 36:55.006
Tonight's the night.

36:55.039 --> 36:56.708
Tonight is definitely
the night.

36:58.309 --> 37:01.312
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares...

37:01.346 --> 37:02.714
Drew is put to the test.

37:04.415 --> 37:06.584
It's like a loaf
of ing bread in there.

37:06.617 --> 37:07.552
Can he handle the heat
in the kitchen?

37:07.585 --> 37:08.553
Andrew...

37:08.586 --> 37:10.121
Stop pushing me
and just chill!

37:10.154 --> 37:12.123
- Can do.
- Oh,.

37:12.156 --> 37:14.559
Or will relaunch dinner
go up in flames?

37:14.592 --> 37:17.128
This is unbelievable.

37:17.161 --> 37:20.865
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

37:30.492 --> 37:31.760
God bless Casa Roma.

37:31.761 --> 37:33.229
Let's go, yes?

37:37.233 --> 37:38.467
How are we all
doing tonight?

37:38.500 --> 37:39.969
Thank you.

37:40.002 --> 37:41.471
Drew!

37:41.504 --> 37:43.306
First order on.
Most important--let's go.

37:43.339 --> 37:46.042
I wanna shine
for Chef Ramsay today.

37:46.075 --> 37:47.643
And it would be silly not to

37:47.677 --> 37:49.512
because I have the best
opportunity ever,

37:49.545 --> 37:51.347
that I've ever had
in my life, actually,

37:51.380 --> 37:52.849
to show that I
can handle it.

37:52.882 --> 37:53.007
We got our setup
for the mushrooms.

37:53.007 --> 37:54.150
We got our setup
for the mushrooms.

37:54.183 --> 37:55.852
Yep.
Wings.

37:55.885 --> 37:56.953
And garlic powder.
So we're ready.

37:56.986 --> 37:58.387
Good.

37:58.421 --> 37:59.889
Hi, guys.
How you doin'?

37:59.922 --> 38:01.491
Are we ready to order?

38:01.524 --> 38:02.892
For relaunch dinner,

38:02.925 --> 38:04.427
Drew has Nylah's son Jimmy

38:04.460 --> 38:06.829
assisting with calzones
and pizzas.

38:06.863 --> 38:08.464
Put the dough on
and stretch it all the way out

38:08.498 --> 38:09.499
till it's even with that.

38:09.532 --> 38:11.234
Jimmy had to be back there
to be solid

38:11.267 --> 38:13.169
and pick up the pace
a little bit.

38:13.202 --> 38:14.670
He's never done that before.

38:14.704 --> 38:16.239
Try not
to make love to it,

38:16.272 --> 38:17.740
and you'll
make it happen, okay?

38:17.774 --> 38:19.509
We're working on the calzones
right now, please.

38:19.542 --> 38:20.910
The wings.
Thank you.

38:20.943 --> 38:22.178
You're welcome.

38:22.211 --> 38:23.007
I'll be right back
with the other two.

38:23.007 --> 38:23.412
I'll be right back
with the other two.

38:23.412 --> 38:24.313
That is not done.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.348
These aren't cooked.

38:26.381 --> 38:28.150
So get--
get her back here.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.719
The whole evening started,
and everybody was in a rush,

38:30.720 --> 38:33.122
and all of a sudden
food was going out cold.

38:33.155 --> 38:34.690
Drew, they complained

38:34.691 --> 38:36.259
that these chickens
are bloody in the center.

38:36.292 --> 38:37.760
They're not even hot.
Quick refire.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.161
Oh, man, I was
rather embarrassed

38:39.194 --> 38:40.329
when the chicken came back.

38:40.362 --> 38:41.664
I was like,
"Oh, come on, not--

38:41.697 --> 38:43.699
We're not starting
like this, you know?"

38:43.732 --> 38:44.933
Here you go.

38:44.934 --> 38:46.268
I gotta relax

38:46.302 --> 38:48.104
and not try to rush things
that take time.

38:48.137 --> 38:51.741
That is the second time
she's brought that back

38:51.774 --> 38:53.007
and that is...underdone.
they're raw.

38:53.007 --> 38:54.543
and that is...underdone.
they're raw.

38:54.543 --> 38:55.644
Again?

38:55.677 --> 38:56.912
Yeah, they're raw.

38:56.945 --> 38:57.813
Let's just go
for a house salad.

38:57.846 --> 38:58.814
Okay.

38:58.847 --> 39:00.415
It was extremely
embarrassing.

39:00.416 --> 39:01.617
Chef Ramsay was
completely disgusted,

39:01.650 --> 39:02.818
as well was I.

39:02.851 --> 39:04.920
- Me.
- Same  table.

39:04.921 --> 39:06.489
That's the second
bowl.

39:06.522 --> 39:07.823
Look at me.

39:07.857 --> 39:10.159
They gotta go in the pan
and in the oven.

39:10.192 --> 39:11.827
They're not even
hot in the center.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.062
What's going on?
Not good enough.

39:14.096 --> 39:15.364
Come on.

39:15.397 --> 39:16.999
Once is a ing joke.

39:17.032 --> 39:18.901
Twice is just disgusting.

39:18.934 --> 39:20.636
No rush.
On the wings.

39:20.669 --> 39:21.937
I'm just trying
to tell everybody.

39:21.970 --> 39:23.007
Just keep workin'.

39:23.007 --> 39:24.039
Just keep workin'.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.874
I don't know what the hell
that thing is.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.276
Jimmy, this is your first
attempt

39:27.309 --> 39:28.777
at a calzone, ever,

39:28.810 --> 39:30.245
and it's the worst one
I've ever seen.

39:30.279 --> 39:31.680
But it's cooked.

39:31.713 --> 39:33.348
Look at the size
of the ing thing.

39:33.382 --> 39:34.349
Is that for two?

39:34.383 --> 39:35.651
It's a large.

39:35.684 --> 39:38.086
The calzone ishuge.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.155
You could probably feed
about five people with it.

39:40.188 --> 39:41.156
Jimmy...

39:41.189 --> 39:42.224
Yes?

39:42.257 --> 39:43.559
The calzones, yeah,
are huge, yeah?

39:43.592 --> 39:44.793
Be careful of the size.

39:44.826 --> 39:46.995
Oh, look
at all the cheese.

39:48.630 --> 39:50.566
I thought I had
a large.

39:50.599 --> 39:52.200
We should have just
got one of those.

39:52.234 --> 39:53.007
We could
feed the station.

39:53.007 --> 39:53.101
We could
feed the station.

39:53.135 --> 39:55.270
This is huge.

39:55.304 --> 39:57.306
Cut down the size
of the calzone, yeah?

39:57.339 --> 39:59.408
That can fill an entire
football end zone.

39:59.441 --> 40:01.076
Look at the size of it,
yeah?

40:01.109 --> 40:02.311
We want them coming back
for more, yeah?

40:02.344 --> 40:03.779
Your other ones are better.

40:05.547 --> 40:06.748
I need some form

40:06.782 --> 40:08.584
of quality control,
guys, yeah?

40:08.617 --> 40:10.586
It's like a loaf of ing
bread in there.

40:10.619 --> 40:12.487
Most important thing here
is standards.

40:12.521 --> 40:15.157
Slow down and pay attention
to detail, yeah?

40:16.525 --> 40:18.160
Has this pizza
been started yet?

40:18.193 --> 40:19.528
No, it just got up there
in the window.

40:19.561 --> 40:20.395
You wanna go ahead
and take that order

40:20.429 --> 40:21.496
and start looking at it?

40:21.530 --> 40:22.998
It's coming, because
he ed up

40:23.031 --> 40:24.366
And he had to make
another one.

40:24.399 --> 40:25.701
It's a calzone.
He's getting beat up over here.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.035
Just take a deep breath.

40:27.069 --> 40:28.503
Stop pushing me
and just chill.

40:28.537 --> 40:30.172
You're making me hurry up
I can't have

40:30.205 --> 40:31.239
Anything to  do with.

40:31.273 --> 40:32.374
Go for it.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.677
This is unbelievable.

40:35.711 --> 40:37.980
Drew now is starting to feel
the pressure, and it's showing.

40:38.013 --> 40:39.815
Cracks are appearing--
he's fighting with the owners,

40:39.848 --> 40:41.550
fighting with the chefs.

40:41.583 --> 40:43.151
If he's not careful, this place
is gonna start sinking.

40:43.185 --> 40:45.053
What a way to celebrate
50 years.

40:45.087 --> 40:47.089
Hold on, Jan,
do not take that.

40:47.122 --> 40:48.790
With orders in the kitchen
backed up...

40:48.824 --> 40:50.926
Don't tell me--
change it.
Okay, sorry.

40:50.959 --> 40:53.007
Customers have a lot
of time on their hands.

40:53.007 --> 40:53.795
Customers have a lot
of time on their hands.

40:53.829 --> 40:55.631
We gotta pull it together.

40:55.664 --> 40:57.499
We're like this rag
right here right now.

40:57.532 --> 40:59.201
You know?
We gotta pull it together.

40:59.234 --> 41:00.802
Okay, I need a large
deluxe calzone

41:00.836 --> 41:02.204
and a small deluxe calzone.

41:02.237 --> 41:04.306
The mushroom calzone's
fired.

41:04.339 --> 41:05.674
I got the calzone up.

41:05.707 --> 41:06.608
The calzone's in, right?
Yes, yes.

41:06.642 --> 41:08.110
Okay, thank you.

41:08.143 --> 41:10.545
In a dramatic turnaround,
head chef Drew

41:10.579 --> 41:12.547
Has finally taken
Gordon's advice

41:12.581 --> 41:14.449
by taking complete control
of the kitchen...

41:14.483 --> 41:16.685
This is your mushroom
calzone.

41:16.718 --> 41:19.321
And orders are moving out
to the customers promptly.

41:19.354 --> 41:20.722
Drew is doing a great job.

41:20.756 --> 41:22.124
He stepped up to the plate.

41:22.157 --> 41:23.007
I'm real proud of him.

41:23.007 --> 41:23.525
I'm real proud of him.

41:23.558 --> 41:25.127
It's good.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.328
Mmm.

41:26.361 --> 41:27.496
That is good.

41:30.132 --> 41:33.402
This one goes to the bar,
right here--thank you.

41:33.435 --> 41:36.004
So nice to actually see
food coming out, fast.

41:36.038 --> 41:37.539
It's pretty good, huh?

41:37.572 --> 41:39.374
I think the new menu
is a huge success,

41:39.408 --> 41:40.976
'cause it's just easier.

41:41.009 --> 41:42.044
Bye, guys!

41:42.077 --> 41:43.745
It was so good.

41:43.779 --> 41:45.480
Yes, I know,
and we're taking it home.

41:45.514 --> 41:47.449
That it, guys?

41:47.482 --> 41:49.051
I pulled it off.

41:49.084 --> 41:52.054
Thank God for Ramsay.

41:52.087 --> 41:53.007
Okay, it was well done.

41:53.007 --> 41:55.357
Okay, it was well done.

41:59.127 --> 42:01.930
After a most impressive
turnaround,

42:01.963 --> 42:04.900
Gordon has some final words
for the staff.

42:04.933 --> 42:06.201
I know I put

42:06.234 --> 42:08.336
a fork and a spoon
on the wall, yeah?

42:08.370 --> 42:10.038
But you didn't have to make
the  calzone to match it.

42:11.506 --> 42:13.141
I mean, crap.

42:13.175 --> 42:14.743
What was that,
for a tent top?

42:14.776 --> 42:16.411
Yeah.
Cut them down.

42:16.445 --> 42:17.713
We're here to make money,
not give it away.

42:17.746 --> 42:18.780
Yeah.

42:18.814 --> 42:19.781
Good.

42:19.815 --> 42:21.316
Now you've taken it.

42:21.349 --> 42:22.584
Make it work.

42:22.617 --> 42:23.007
We will.

42:23.007 --> 42:24.052
We will.

42:24.086 --> 42:25.554
We're gonna
keep each other

42:25.587 --> 42:26.855
motivated on this.

42:26.888 --> 42:28.557
Considering we have
a new menu,

42:28.590 --> 42:30.292
a new chef, new look,

42:30.325 --> 42:31.793
if we couldn't
make this restaurant work,

42:31.827 --> 42:33.295
we'd definitely be idiots.

42:33.328 --> 42:35.731
Trust me--if everyone
does their bit,

42:35.764 --> 42:38.266
three months down the line,
this place is gonna be rockin'.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.835
My heart's here.

42:39.868 --> 42:41.036
He saw that.

42:41.069 --> 42:43.672
He saw that it's
a dream of mine.

42:43.705 --> 42:46.441
And I just wanna--
I wanna make it live.

42:46.475 --> 42:47.442
What a week.

42:47.476 --> 42:49.211
When I first arrived,

42:49.244 --> 42:51.847
that had to be the worst-ever
Italian restaurant going.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.007
Then we made
some drastic changes--

42:53.007 --> 42:53.682
Then we made
some drastic changes--

42:53.715 --> 42:55.751
promoted the chef,
reinvigorated the owners,

42:55.784 --> 42:58.587
and turned this place into
a really nice, classy pizzeria.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.356
I only hope now
Lancaster embraces it.

43:01.389 --> 43:02.991
But one thing's for sure.

43:03.024 --> 43:05.827
That has to be the biggest
ing calzone

43:05.861 --> 43:08.263
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

43:08.263 --> 43:09.615
Holy mackerel.
