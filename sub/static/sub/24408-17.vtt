Ohh... [ Giggling ]

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
But why?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
What would you possibly need to get a peek for?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It was just a routine safety inspection!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Remember when the Ninja Kids stink-bombed

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
the whole creek last summer?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
No! You don't!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
'Cause guess who found their stockpile

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
and reported them to the authorities?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You're welcome!

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Oh, Craig, to have all your most precious items ruined.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
If only you could ruin something of Jason's,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
like his sash of badges!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Jane! George!

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm sorry, okay? These badges are all I got.

Please!

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Just like your maps. It's only fair.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Now remember, Craig,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
dismembering Jason's badges would be quite rude.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I guess you'll have to choose --

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
cake or revenge?

Hmm...Mm...

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The cake is a fake! Just like you!

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You invite kids here to fight each other

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000

Hey, Craig...

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I just gotta ask...

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
why didn't you cut off my badges?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I ruined your stuff.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
It wouldn't have accomplished anything.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Cutting off your badges

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
wouldn't have brought my maps back.

Hey, Jason! Eat gym socks, punk!
