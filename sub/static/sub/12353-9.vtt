00:54.334 --> 00:56.634
Hey, Clyde Oberholt.

00:56.668 --> 01:00.000
And you must be this pod
I've heard so much about.

01:00.034 --> 01:03.100
Jeannie van der Hooven.

01:03.134 --> 01:04.800
Doug Guggenheim.

01:04.833 --> 01:07.267
You recognize the name?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.167
Well, that's actually
a funny story.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.601
When I got into Harvard...

01:12.034 --> 01:14.100
My name is Marty Kaan.

01:14.134 --> 01:15.800
This is even stupid to bring up,

01:15.833 --> 01:18.668
but my last 360,
zero development needs.

01:18.701 --> 01:20.734
I aced my exams.

01:20.768 --> 01:23.034
Okay, I got one wrong.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.768
Though we don't know
the exact family tree

01:24.800 --> 01:26.200
of the Guggenheim name... uh...

01:26.234 --> 01:28.601
Yeah, I can...
I can shut the fuck up.

01:28.634 --> 01:31.467
I feel like I'm back in B school
going out on job interviews.

01:31.501 --> 01:34.800
Fuck. Excuse my French.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.867
We could hang out.
What are your likes and dislikes?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.000
I'll go first. Board games.

01:38.034 --> 01:39.967
Are you kidding me with this shit?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.467
I mean, look at yourselves.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.434
You can do better than this.
This is ridiculous.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.501
Hey, Dad, what's an ouroboros?

01:49.534 --> 01:52.434
Uh, I think it's a monkey.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.933
Close. It's a snake.

01:53.967 --> 01:55.634
A snake eating its own tail.

01:55.668 --> 01:58.034
A snake eating its own tail,
that's right. Mm-hmm.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.501
It's one of the symbols

01:59.534 --> 02:02.634
of cyclicality, like
everything going in a circle.

02:02.668 --> 02:04.967
It's also one of the assimilations

02:05.000 --> 02:06.467
of opposites,

02:06.501 --> 02:09.668
like, uh, dealing with a shadow.

02:09.701 --> 02:13.367
You remember I told you about
the shadow. Yeah, maybe.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.367
Yeah, right, right, right.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.234
Like dealing with those
parts of ourselves

02:18.267 --> 02:22.467
that, uh, we really need
to look at, but, uh,

02:22.501 --> 02:25.501
don't want to.

02:25.534 --> 02:28.067
Yeah, so for the
purposes of your report,

02:28.100 --> 02:31.567
it's a snake eating its own tail.

02:31.601 --> 02:33.067
Hmm, okay.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.367
In the financial services sector,

02:49.401 --> 02:54.034
there are legends and
then there are giants

02:54.067 --> 02:57.434
who dwarf these mere legends.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.833
K. Warren McDale...

02:59.867 --> 03:01.900
He looks like the ghost
of Christmas past.

03:01.933 --> 03:04.200
...Kenny to his friends.

03:04.234 --> 03:07.933
K. Warren McDale is such a giant...

03:07.967 --> 03:09.367
Oh, my God.

03:09.401 --> 03:11.734
How can he talk with all
that cock in his mouth?

03:11.768 --> 03:13.301
Skip, that's too big
for your mouth. Stop.

03:13.334 --> 03:14.634
Would you please? Shh!

03:17.167 --> 03:18.467
...towering...

03:18.501 --> 03:21.034
I was... over the rest of us.

03:21.067 --> 03:25.134
His mere presence sends
a signal to these

03:25.167 --> 03:27.701
so-called legends
to step aside. Skip?

03:27.734 --> 03:30.200
To move on, to... Jesus Christ.

03:30.234 --> 03:32.067
Anyway, a man who needs

03:32.100 --> 03:34.967
absolutely no introduction.
K. Warren...

03:35.000 --> 03:38.234
I'm bringing in another consultancy
to do a top-down on Galweather.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.334
Every partner, every PM,
every analyst

03:41.367 --> 03:43.467
will be interviewed.
There's going to be no exceptions.

03:43.501 --> 03:46.067
We'll be looking at
your leverage ratio,

03:46.100 --> 03:47.167
staffing pyramid,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.067
average revenue per partner,

03:49.100 --> 03:52.100
client side impact... Motherfucker.

03:52.134 --> 03:53.668
Every spot on your goddamn nutsack.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.267
So good luck.

04:00.334 --> 04:02.100
Hi, Kenny.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.000
I cannot wait to show
you our takeaways.

04:09.034 --> 04:10.833
Well, I always love
your takeaways, darlin'.

04:10.867 --> 04:11.933
Ooh.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.000
Hey, Marty.

04:15.034 --> 04:16.267
James.

04:16.301 --> 04:19.668
Motherfucking motherfucker.

04:19.701 --> 04:23.100
Okay, let me introduce you to our
outside team from Kinsley-Johnson.

04:23.134 --> 04:25.967
They are the best this
business has to offer.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.100
And I mean the best.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.467
It's funny how that works...

04:28.501 --> 04:31.034
Greg. Yeah, what?

04:31.067 --> 04:33.000
This is a nine-figure deal. Mm-hmm.

04:33.034 --> 04:35.534
I hope you're not nursing
a hard-on for Kaan here.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.100
I...

04:37.134 --> 04:38.501
Can you nurse a hard-on?

04:38.534 --> 04:40.100
If anybody can do it, you can.

04:40.134 --> 04:42.967
You're the hard-on that
needs a nurse. Ew. What?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.534
Because love him or hate him,
whether he survives or gets

04:45.567 --> 04:49.301
thrown to the wolves,
Marty Kaan is at least his own man.

04:49.334 --> 04:51.200
Thank you, K.

04:51.234 --> 04:54.800
And you and his team had
better learn to work together.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.301
If you don't start interfacing
in some real and meaningful way,

04:58.334 --> 04:59.833
I'm going to shitcan
the lot of you.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.234
Is that perfectly understood?

05:01.267 --> 05:03.867
I think that... Okay. Oh, good.

05:05.768 --> 05:07.034
Great speech, Skip.

05:07.067 --> 05:09.367
Very inspiring.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.701
Hi, Daddy. Please.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.167
Please don't do this here.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.567
Okay?

05:20.601 --> 05:22.501
Well, where am I supposed to do it?

05:22.534 --> 05:24.900
You always have that
little whore at your place.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.167
You aren't really getting off
on this right now, are you?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.234
I mean, that's too
twisted even for you.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.567
What are you...?
This little engagement? Yeah.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.601
Oh, please, you have
nothing to worry about.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.401
Oh, not good.

05:36.434 --> 05:39.034
I'm just the PM. I have six other
engagements going on this week.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.100
How long you think you guys
are going to stay bulletproof

05:41.134 --> 05:42.534
with business practices like that?

05:42.567 --> 05:45.933
Well, as long as our competition
is still shitting the bed.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.534
Oh...? Oh, which reminds me.

05:47.567 --> 05:50.034
I want you in my ass.

05:50.067 --> 05:53.134
See you later, sweetie. Yep.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.933
Bye, sycophants.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.701
Bye.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.768
Would it be weird if I hit that?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.234
You allergic to penicillin?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.867
No. Hit it.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.234
Are you seriously okay with that?

06:05.267 --> 06:06.867
Because I would hit her... it that.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.567
Okay, we have to be able
to say it to hit it.

06:09.601 --> 06:12.867
Want to go practice in
your office? Yeah, sure.

06:14.301 --> 06:15.701
It's all happening.

06:15.734 --> 06:17.701
We have to stop this train, Marco.

06:19.768 --> 06:21.867
I understand your concerns, Marty.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.000
But it sounded more like

06:24.034 --> 06:26.967
K. Warren wanted to blow
you than fire you. Ow!

06:27.000 --> 06:30.067
Fuck you, Kanani! What, too hard?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.933
What is it about the words "green
card" you don't understand?

06:32.967 --> 06:34.334
I'm from Hawaii.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.567
K. Warren doesn't
think in human terms.

06:36.601 --> 06:38.267
He thinks in piles of cash.

06:38.301 --> 06:41.234
I thought you made him piles of
cash in the mortgage collapse.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.933
That's not going to translate.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.000
When Greg and Skip get through
shitting all over me that...

06:45.034 --> 06:47.067
No, we got to do
something big here, man.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.768
Something fucking seismic.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.334
Burn this place down.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.301
Poison the well.

06:54.334 --> 06:57.200
Oh, that's it!
That is it! That's it!

06:57.234 --> 06:58.267
Oh, finally.

07:00.301 --> 07:02.501
Oh! All right, I'm out of here.

07:02.534 --> 07:03.933
You bitch.

07:03.967 --> 07:06.367
All right, same time next week.
Wednesday, okay?

07:06.401 --> 07:08.367
Thanks, baby. Bye, baby.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.367
Marco, let's seize our destiny.

07:13.401 --> 07:15.367
Skip wants me out of the business.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.367
Let's push his ass out.

07:17.401 --> 07:20.267
Or at least take this
merger away from MetroCap.

07:20.301 --> 07:21.501
Or both.

07:21.534 --> 07:23.967
Both?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.167
Mm-hmm.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.167
You got a both?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.867
You ever heard of a guy
named Enrique Cazuelas?

07:29.900 --> 07:32.000
South American oil money
flowing out of his ass.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.034
You bet I heard of him.
Yeah, sick money.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.301
Unfair money.

07:35.334 --> 07:36.501
And he owes me.

07:36.534 --> 07:37.701
I put together

07:37.734 --> 07:40.034
his entire international package.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.301
This might be a nice
little hobby for him.

07:42.334 --> 07:43.800
Enrique could be

07:43.833 --> 07:45.701
our white knight.

07:46.933 --> 07:50.334
And if you were to
say to Enrique, uh...

07:50.367 --> 07:53.701
"Let's blow Skip out of the water"?

07:54.501 --> 07:56.067
Vaporized.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.800
Oh, hey, Marty, Marty.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.167
Aw.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.701
Marty, Marty, Marty.
Greg, Greg, Greg.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.000
Marty, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:05.034 --> 08:07.067
Big-- big owie for Greggie.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.434
Poor me. Moving on.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.900
Anyway, we should have a meeting.

08:10.933 --> 08:13.334
You, me, your pod, a strategy sesh.

08:14.601 --> 08:16.067
Yeah. Right?

08:16.100 --> 08:18.200
That's complete bullshit. What?

08:18.234 --> 08:20.200
Are you fucking kidding me?
A strategy sesh...?

08:20.234 --> 08:22.734
Greg, you hate me.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.501
You hate my team.

08:24.534 --> 08:26.800
You orchestrated this whole
"merger/hostile takeover"

08:26.833 --> 08:28.701
'cause you want to
make me your slave.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.200
I... slave, I... It's just a word,
but it's true, right?

08:31.234 --> 08:32.668
You don't even want to fire me.

08:32.701 --> 08:34.400
You just want to
fucking humiliate me

08:34.433 --> 08:36.832
until my contract's up,
so that you can see me broken

08:36.866 --> 08:39.267
professionally.
Personally, if possible.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.034
But here's the
fucked-up thing, Greg.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.000
You also like me, don't you?

08:43.034 --> 08:46.267
And since you got here to L.A.
, you got your head all fucked up.

08:46.301 --> 08:50.267
You don't even know if you give a shit
about the things you used to care about
anymore.

08:50.301 --> 08:52.701
Your job, your career,
your New York life,

08:52.734 --> 08:54.234
your empty-headed ex-wife.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.167
This is only going to end one
of two ways between us, Greg.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.601
Either we're going to
move past this shit,

08:59.634 --> 09:01.734
or you and I are going to
fucking kill each other.

09:01.768 --> 09:03.501
So fuck the strategy sesh.

09:03.534 --> 09:05.167
Fuck it right in its lame ass.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.434
Here's what you and I need to do-
we need to go out.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.434
Let's go out and rage, man.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.401
Let's spend a shitload
of Metro's money.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.900
Let's drink.
Let's get so fucking high

09:13.933 --> 09:16.601
we black out and can't
even remember our names.

09:16.634 --> 09:19.734
And then let's do unspeakable things to
people we are never going to see again.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.401
And then we're gonna know.

09:21.434 --> 09:24.800
Then we're gonna know if we even
care anymore. Let's do that.

09:31.401 --> 09:32.634
Yes.

09:36.634 --> 09:38.434
Let's... let's do it! Let's do it!

09:38.467 --> 09:40.634
Yeah. Hey, uh, bring Jeannie.

09:40.668 --> 09:42.301
Oh, she's coming. Yeah.

09:42.334 --> 09:45.167
Strategy sesh? Bullshit!

09:48.634 --> 09:50.000
See you later!

09:53.768 --> 09:55.434
Hey, baby.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.567
Coming up here?

09:57.601 --> 09:59.634
To my work?

09:59.668 --> 10:03.467
No! Uh, actually,
I was just going down in the, um,

10:03.501 --> 10:06.267
the elevator 'cause I was
gonna go get a coffee,

10:06.301 --> 10:08.800
so I will, I'll meet
you downstairs, okay?

10:11.367 --> 10:13.734
Oh, Hey! Hey, hey! Oh, fuck! Hi.

10:13.768 --> 10:14.933
You're out of breath. Yeah.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.933
I was just gonna pop
up and surprise you.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.800
Oh, I... it's so
crazy up there today.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.000
Hey, where's your ring?

10:20.034 --> 10:22.833
Uh, I'm getting it resized

10:22.867 --> 10:24.434
'cause it, like, fell off

10:24.467 --> 10:27.267
the other day when I was
doing the... the, um...

10:27.301 --> 10:28.833
Are you all right? You're...

10:28.867 --> 10:31.301
Yes, um, yes.

10:31.334 --> 10:35.467
There's... these other, um...

10:35.501 --> 10:39.768
consultants in today assessing
our performance, and it's...

10:39.800 --> 10:41.501
Consultants consulting
the consultants?

10:41.534 --> 10:43.100
Yeah. It's fucked, right?

10:43.134 --> 10:45.467
That's like, the, uh... what is it,
the snake thing

10:45.501 --> 10:46.501
that eats its own...

10:46.534 --> 10:47.933
Yeah. Hey, Marty.

10:47.967 --> 10:50.800
And I wasn't... Mar...
? Marty? Marty Kaan?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.534
Marty Kaan!

10:52.567 --> 10:53.833
The man, the legend?

10:53.867 --> 10:56.867
Hold on a second. Do I know you?

10:56.900 --> 10:58.367
Jeans talks about you all the time.

10:58.401 --> 10:59.567
Some of it's actually
even pretty good.

10:59.601 --> 11:01.067
Who's this?

11:01.100 --> 11:05.668
Marty, this is Wes, my fianc?

11:11.534 --> 11:13.567
I'll call you back.

11:13.601 --> 11:17.501
Oh, my God. Wes.
Maybe she'll shut up

11:17.534 --> 11:19.401
talking about you now
that I've finally met you.

11:19.434 --> 11:21.034
Tells so many stories about...
I feel like

11:21.067 --> 11:22.134
I should fucking marry you,

11:22.167 --> 11:23.334
she tell so many Wes stories.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.701
It's, like, "Wes,
Wes, Wes, Wes, Wes."

11:25.734 --> 11:27.567
It's like a Wes-tern
up there. Right?

11:27.601 --> 11:28.833
He is funny.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.933
You don't need a PR firm,
not with this one,

11:30.967 --> 11:33.534
Miss Chatty Kathy.
Okay, good to meet you.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.434
Finally, it's good to, uh...

11:35.467 --> 11:36.933
That's the word: finally.

11:36.967 --> 11:39.034
Okay, okay.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.234
Take care.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.401
Yep.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.401
Marty Kaan.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.900
Oh, my God! Hurry, hurry!

11:54.933 --> 11:56.768
No! Here!

12:02.833 --> 12:04.768
Here, in the bag.

12:09.234 --> 12:11.034
You are not slick. What?

12:11.067 --> 12:13.067
What? What?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.933
Ah, echo in here, huh?

12:14.967 --> 12:17.401
Mostly, what are you doing up?

12:17.434 --> 12:18.933
None of your business.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.601
Oh, really?

12:20.634 --> 12:22.367
Remember how good you used to sleep

12:22.401 --> 12:24.467
after I'd spank your behind?

12:24.501 --> 12:26.034
Oh, no, no, no.

12:26.067 --> 12:28.367
I got his back on that one, Marty.

12:28.401 --> 12:30.167
Straight up.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.467
Ah, so, it's a conspiracy,
huh? A little two-against-one thing.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.967
Mm-hmm. I see.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.833
Go to bed. Night, Dad.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.601
Night, April!

12:38.634 --> 12:40.668
What?!

12:40.701 --> 12:43.267
Whoa. Whoa, what was all that?

12:43.301 --> 12:45.301
That was fresh.
Let me get some of that.

12:45.334 --> 12:48.067
Things have changed around here,
Mister. Night, Dad.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.768
Guess I'll just put
that back in there.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.000
Oh, God.

12:51.034 --> 12:52.567
I fucking hate you, Marty.

12:52.601 --> 12:53.800
Awesome.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.167
Welcome to the club.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.967
You care to elaborate?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.768
I really like that kid.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.301
Yeah, me, too.

13:00.334 --> 13:03.301
What's up with you?

13:03.334 --> 13:06.933
Nothing. I don't know. I just...

13:06.967 --> 13:09.668
I should just shut up and
live in the moment, right?

13:09.701 --> 13:12.334
Hey-hey-hey-hey.
Just give me a kiss.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.234
Is this just an
extended booty call?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.933
No.

13:23.967 --> 13:27.034
April, look at me.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.967
No.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.134
Come here.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.833
But, uh, you know,

13:37.867 --> 13:39.833
I won't bore you with
the details of that.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.567
Unless you want me to, I can.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.034
I can go into it for you.

13:43.067 --> 13:44.734
Fuck. I said it again.

13:44.768 --> 13:46.800
I don't even think about
bonuses until it's...

13:46.833 --> 13:48.301
Give me one...

13:48.334 --> 13:50.467
Oh, this is embar... I can't
believe this is happening.

13:50.501 --> 13:53.367
in front of everybody.
Warren Buffet. Super needy.

13:53.401 --> 13:56.367
Give me one sec. W. Buffed.

13:56.401 --> 13:58.200
Columbia. Are you joking?

13:58.234 --> 14:00.534
Went to Harvard. Nope.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.467
That's funny. I know people
who have gone to Harvard.

14:02.501 --> 14:04.034
I went to Wharton, actually.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.401
You know, I got into, uh,

14:05.434 --> 14:09.167
Lecoq in France,
the famous clowning school.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.234
Sell! Sell! Yeah.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.634
Then buy it back!
I don't know, man.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.267
I know, right?

14:19.301 --> 14:20.734
Marty's a great boss.

14:20.768 --> 14:22.034
I live by one rule:

14:22.067 --> 14:25.768
WWMD. What would Marty do?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.401
That's it.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.100
Oh, and also do whatever
the company wants.

14:30.134 --> 14:31.601
I've learned dedication.

14:31.634 --> 14:33.534
I've learned to do
anything to get the deal.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.067
Honestly?

14:35.100 --> 14:37.567
I learned the most to
learn from his mistakes.

14:37.601 --> 14:39.900
It's the only way you can
get better is by watching

14:39.933 --> 14:41.434
someone fuck up in front of you.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.234
You do whatever you have to do.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.701
Whatever it takes.

14:44.734 --> 14:46.933
And then you deal with
the fallout later.

14:46.967 --> 14:49.701
And that fallout can be your family,
can be your parents,

14:49.734 --> 14:51.567
can be your kids, relationships.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.701
All those things fucking
go by the wayside.

14:53.734 --> 14:56.067
Are you prepared for that?
I'm just joking.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.701
I don't know what the fuck this is.

14:57.734 --> 14:59.768
You just, you just do what you do.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.567
You kids kill me.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.867
Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

15:08.900 --> 15:12.301
Do you realize I've never had

15:12.334 --> 15:13.768
Korean barbeque in my life?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.900
Man, that was awesome!

15:14.933 --> 15:16.234
That was bone-fucking awesome!

15:16.267 --> 15:17.800
Yep. Doug?

15:17.833 --> 15:19.000
Doug, what are you doing?

15:19.034 --> 15:20.234
I think I'm gonna float away!

15:20.267 --> 15:21.734
You are, bro, I'm gonna help you.

15:21.768 --> 15:23.301
Come here. I'm gonna
help you. Wait. No.

15:23.334 --> 15:25.401
Yes. You're good, you're good,
you're good. Look at you.

15:25.434 --> 15:26.800
I feel like I'm made
out of balloons.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.434
Look at you. You're awesome.
Help him, help him.

15:28.467 --> 15:29.967
There you go. Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Jeannie van der...

15:32.034 --> 15:34.067
Hooven.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.401
Hoo...

15:36.434 --> 15:39.134
Greg Norbert! That's right.

15:40.301 --> 15:42.401
Leave it. Let it go. Let it go.

15:42.434 --> 15:43.734
It's not worth it.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.434
Wow, you are a deep, deep...

15:45.467 --> 15:46.501
You're deep. You're a deep well.

15:46.534 --> 15:49.301
I know. Yes, I am, Greg.

15:49.334 --> 15:51.134
Yes, yes. I am.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.634
She's a very deep well.

15:52.668 --> 15:54.167
She is full of secrets.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.768
Secrets that are a great
Westery to most of us.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.134
What does that mean?
What secrets are we talking about?

16:00.167 --> 16:03.501
You ever go, you ever
go stand-up paddling?

16:03.534 --> 16:05.334
I don't know what that means.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.601
Hey. Yeah?

16:06.634 --> 16:08.668
Do we have a play here? Not yet.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.534
I love L.A.! I love it!

16:12.634 --> 16:13.867
This way!

16:13.900 --> 16:16.701
I'll meet you there in a sec.
All right.

16:16.734 --> 16:17.967
Hey-hey-hey,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.501
feeling all... feeling all
boxed in and withdrawn?

16:22.534 --> 16:23.900
I feel okay. You feel okay?

16:23.933 --> 16:25.167
I do. Feel okay? No, no!

16:25.200 --> 16:26.401
You do feel good?

16:26.434 --> 16:28.301
No, no, no! I'm so sorry.

16:28.334 --> 16:30.634
What do mean,
you're sorry?! I had to.

16:30.668 --> 16:32.334
Even with the weight of
the world on you, man?

16:32.367 --> 16:35.067
Like, with Greg the Company
Slayer standing over you,

16:35.100 --> 16:37.234
broadsword held high? Zounds,
my lord! You still good?

16:37.267 --> 16:39.301
I think I'm O.D.'ing I'm overd'ing.

16:39.334 --> 16:41.000
You're not overd'ing.
I'm overd'ing.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.668
One day you come into my life,
you devastate my fucking life,

16:43.701 --> 16:45.768
I come and I devastate
your fucking career, man.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.301
You're not gonna do that. You know,

16:47.334 --> 16:49.401
I spend my whole career
kissing up to my boss.

16:49.434 --> 16:51.234
He doesn't give a shit
about Greg Norbert. Nada!

16:51.267 --> 16:52.467
Hold it. No, no, no...

16:52.501 --> 16:54.668
That's not legal in L.A.?

16:54.701 --> 16:56.967
Excuse me. Mr. Greg Norbert?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.800
I heard before. I overheard you
say that it doesn't matter.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.800
And I just thought,

17:01.833 --> 17:04.601
I wanted to tell you that I think
that's a subjective statement.

17:04.634 --> 17:07.701
Yes, Norbert, having a job matters to me.
And to me. And to me.

17:07.733 --> 17:08.967
No-no-no-no-no- no-no-no-no!

17:09.000 --> 17:10.768
No, imagine both
you guys get fired.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.701
You guys can spend
more time together,

17:12.733 --> 17:14.099
maybe even start a family.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.434
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No!

17:16.467 --> 17:18.501
The direction of your
lives will change.

17:18.534 --> 17:20.967
Greg, can we just go back
to the part where you said

17:21.000 --> 17:23.501
Doug Guggenheim and I are
starting a family together?

17:23.534 --> 17:24.833
Is that a sore subject?

17:24.867 --> 17:26.501
'Cause it is for so many couples.

17:26.534 --> 17:28.000
Exactly. It is, you guys.

17:28.034 --> 17:29.367
Oh, no, I get it. Stop.

17:29.401 --> 17:30.634
I see what you've done.

17:30.668 --> 17:31.867
No, it's for straight couples, too.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.067
I know. It is.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.067
Exactly. Big decision.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.833
That's the thing. Clyde and I,

17:35.867 --> 17:37.067
we are a straight couple!

17:37.100 --> 17:38.900
That is the worst thing
you could have said.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.867
There's no... There's no judgments!

17:40.900 --> 17:42.734
Dude, I'm so high.

17:44.034 --> 17:47.034
Uh, Gregory? Gregory?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.867

19:02.501 --> 19:06.634
Albert Hoffman takes 25 times
the threshold dose of LSD

19:06.668 --> 19:09.567
and rides his bicycle through
the streets of Basel.

19:09.601 --> 19:13.701
The first therapeutic use
of lysergic ac diethylamide.

19:13.734 --> 19:17.267
The drug later goes on to be
used as a psychotomimetic,

19:17.301 --> 19:20.134
a psychotropic,
in CIA mind control studies,

19:20.167 --> 19:22.900
and as a great way
to see a concert.

19:22.933 --> 19:26.200
But for our purposes,
please observe one Gregory Norbert.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.768
I've watched him
these past few weeks

19:29.800 --> 19:32.567
poised on the precipice of... what?

19:32.601 --> 19:35.134
Self-actualization?

19:35.167 --> 19:37.467
Genuine epiphany?

19:37.501 --> 19:40.401
Consciousness-opening revelation?

19:40.434 --> 19:43.601
Whatever it fucking takes for him

19:43.634 --> 19:45.900
to leave his hands off
me and my company,

19:45.933 --> 19:48.434
please, Lord, let us pray.

19:58.367 --> 19:59.768
Uh, 10,000.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.100
What was that?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.334
10,000-- that's how
many restaurants

20:02.367 --> 20:03.833
there are in Manhattan.

20:03.867 --> 20:05.234
That's what you're
going to ask, right?

20:05.267 --> 20:06.601
Actually L.A.

20:06.634 --> 20:08.434
L.A. Oh. QSR or fine dine?

20:08.467 --> 20:10.100
Wow. Fine dine.

20:10.134 --> 20:11.768
4,617.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.467
Yeah. Do you want to
know my methodology?

20:15.501 --> 20:17.034
Uh, supply side or demand side,
uh, triangulating...

20:17.067 --> 20:19.301
What about, uh... $560.

20:19.334 --> 20:21.200
A month. Huh?

20:21.234 --> 20:23.367
That's what you spend on
your electricity bill.

20:23.401 --> 20:25.334
Wow.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.167
Impressive, huh?
I can see he's married,

20:27.200 --> 20:29.334
so I impute the 1.7 children.

20:29.367 --> 20:30.601
No stepfamily-- yet.

20:30.634 --> 20:32.034
I mean, and given the typical...

20:32.067 --> 20:34.167
Okay. Okay.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.501
It's all up here.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.000
And locked away in
the Guggen-vault.

20:37.034 --> 20:38.833
Sometimes it's too much.

20:38.867 --> 20:41.668
I went to Andover with your fianc?

20:41.701 --> 20:43.034
Amanda.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.367
Oh, good.

20:44.401 --> 20:46.668
Good school. Good fianc?

20:46.701 --> 20:48.034
Do you think you'll want

20:48.067 --> 20:50.634
to keep working after
you get married?

20:50.668 --> 20:53.501
Not like you'll have to,
with all of Wes's money.

20:53.534 --> 20:57.467
Um, that's...

20:57.501 --> 20:59.734
none of your fucking business.

21:00.768 --> 21:02.200
But yeah,

21:02.234 --> 21:03.734
I will keep working

21:03.768 --> 21:05.534
until I'm a senior partner...

21:06.567 --> 21:08.200
...and you're still perfecting

21:08.234 --> 21:09.833
cappuccino orders.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.467
When I look down the
barrel of this thing

21:11.501 --> 21:12.701
and I really think it through--

21:12.734 --> 21:14.000
right, when the dust settles--

21:14.034 --> 21:16.067
you know what I see?
I see you guys.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.067
I see Kinsley.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.833
And I want you to have

21:19.867 --> 21:23.668
the first shot at Clyde Oberholt.

21:23.701 --> 21:25.401
Start the bidding now.

21:26.967 --> 21:29.200
Be the first ones.

21:30.601 --> 21:32.401
You want me to take it back.

21:32.434 --> 21:33.701
I know people laugh at me.

21:33.734 --> 21:35.100
Uh, behind my back,
sometimes to my face.

21:35.134 --> 21:37.200
Uh, I'm a social retard.
I get that.

21:37.234 --> 21:39.434
Uh, do I have many friends?
Not really.

21:39.467 --> 21:42.567
But when it comes to numbers,
there is no one better.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.200
That's not a brag.
You can look it up.

21:44.234 --> 21:45.768
So, uh...

21:45.800 --> 21:47.200
having said that, can I...

21:47.234 --> 21:49.567
can I ask what you, uh,
wrote down about me?

21:49.601 --> 21:52.234
Oh... don't write that down.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.067
Stop writing down stuff I say.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.833
When this doesn't happen,

21:55.867 --> 21:58.367
and then you're sitting
on this side of the desk

21:58.401 --> 22:00.100
and they're looking
at you three assholes

22:00.134 --> 22:01.734
going, "Which one did it?"

22:01.768 --> 22:03.534
When you start fucking
each other over,

22:03.567 --> 22:05.200
you try to throw him under the bus,

22:05.234 --> 22:06.601
you offer to fuck her,

22:06.634 --> 22:09.434
you give him a blow job,
you give him a hand job,

22:09.467 --> 22:11.134
all of a sudden,
you're gay, what happens?

22:11.167 --> 22:12.800
How do you get out of that?

22:12.833 --> 22:16.301
I'm not going to forget any of you.

22:16.334 --> 22:17.867
And when it doesn't go down,

22:17.900 --> 22:19.800
I'm coming for each one
of you motherfuckers.

22:19.833 --> 22:22.134
Now, write that
shit in your report.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.501
Well, he is into it-- I mean,
in theory.

22:38.534 --> 22:40.800
The Argentinean peso

22:40.833 --> 22:42.167
is a little wonky right now,

22:42.200 --> 22:44.434
but I think he's going
to come through.

22:44.467 --> 22:46.933
Jesus Christ. Your man's
that liquid? Oil? Yeah.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.800
No, that's seriously liquid.
No, that's liquid.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.434
Oh. Greg.

22:53.467 --> 22:54.668
Hey. Hey.

22:54.701 --> 22:55.933
Hey.

22:55.967 --> 22:57.833
Hey. Hey.

23:01.867 --> 23:03.434
Is there something
I can do for you?

23:03.467 --> 23:05.200
Oh. No, actually,

23:05.234 --> 23:07.000
I'm good.

23:07.034 --> 23:10.334
I am real... good.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.301
Good. Uh, should we, uh...

23:12.334 --> 23:14.701
Oh, yeah. Let's...

23:28.900 --> 23:31.267
Uh-oh.

23:31.301 --> 23:32.800
So vulnerable.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.367
So how was my team?

23:34.401 --> 23:35.933
Weren't they amazing?

23:35.967 --> 23:37.668
Everything I'd expected.

23:37.701 --> 23:39.200
I'm not trying to
shut your shop down.

23:39.234 --> 23:40.467
I hope you know that, sweetie.

23:40.501 --> 23:41.701
I prefer you with your balls.

23:41.734 --> 23:43.501
Wow.

23:43.534 --> 23:46.734
That's so sweet and...
patronizing at the same time.

23:46.768 --> 23:48.534
Hmm.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.734
Maybe you should teach me a lesson.

23:52.768 --> 23:54.501
I think I'm just going to go home.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.867
Ugh! You're being such
a boner killer lately.

23:56.900 --> 24:00.301
Monica, maybe we
could just let it go.

24:00.334 --> 24:02.301
I mean, can you imagine

24:02.334 --> 24:04.534
what a relief that could be?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.167
Yeah, maybe.

24:18.701 --> 24:19.900
Hold on. Hold on, Marty.

24:19.933 --> 24:21.167
Hold on. Come on in.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.401
Follow me. What?

24:22.434 --> 24:23.668
Come on. Just follow me.

24:23.701 --> 24:24.900
Nah, this way. This way.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.867
Wait right here.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.734
Okay. Wait.

24:31.768 --> 24:33.334
Dad...

24:33.367 --> 24:35.668
why are you taking Sinemet?

24:38.833 --> 24:40.800
Why are you going through my shit?

24:40.833 --> 24:42.367
I wasn't going through... Shh! Shh!

24:42.401 --> 24:44.200
I wasn't going through your shit.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.867
There was a pill in the middle
of the floor the other day.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.567
Why are you taking
Parkinson's drugs?

24:48.601 --> 24:51.234
Do the math.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.601
Why didn't you tell me?

24:55.634 --> 24:59.267
Because... I figured you'd
just try to-- I don't know--

24:59.301 --> 25:01.167
you know, kill me off
preemptively, you know,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.267
to avoid any sort of,
uh, well, discomfort

25:03.301 --> 25:04.867
or pain in the future,
and I thought...

25:04.900 --> 25:06.167
Are you serious?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.501
Yes, I'm fucking serious, Marty.

25:09.734 --> 25:11.267
This shit is manageable.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.668
They've got all kinds of drugs.

25:12.701 --> 25:14.334
They got therapies.

25:14.367 --> 25:16.200
And I'm going to be around
for a very long time.

25:16.234 --> 25:17.668
Like it or not, huh?

25:17.701 --> 25:20.267
I don't want some
sort of prepackaged,

25:20.301 --> 25:22.134
un-messy relationship with my son.

25:22.167 --> 25:23.867
I want you to continue
to challenge me,

25:23.900 --> 25:27.367
you know, and to take me for
granted and to be the...

25:27.401 --> 25:28.800
unbelievably fucking difficult

25:28.833 --> 25:30.867
person that you are.

25:32.734 --> 25:34.501
Because I like that person.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.100
By the way,

25:38.134 --> 25:41.200
it's my body, and I can
tell whoever the hell

25:41.234 --> 25:43.601
that I want to tell, okay? Pop.
Pop, Pop, Pop.

25:43.634 --> 25:46.334
Okay. I hear you.

25:47.401 --> 25:49.701
Thanks for the concern.

25:49.734 --> 25:52.100
Truly.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.267
Wait right here.

25:56.967 --> 25:58.501
Come. Look.

25:58.534 --> 26:00.467
Come on, this way. Come on.

26:00.501 --> 26:03.234
Sure it hasn't kicked in yet?
Your hands are shaky as hell.

26:04.634 --> 26:06.501
All right. Keep your
eyes closed, now.

26:06.534 --> 26:07.768
Okay.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.267
Are we... are we still whispering?

No, we're not whispering.
