14:24.193 --> 14:26.361

- You need to leave, now.

Dad, I'm scared.

14:40.876 --> 14:42.177
What's happening?

14:42.211 --> 14:44.279
Take this. Climb Allegheny.

14:44.313 --> 14:46.147

14:46.182 --> 14:47.616
I'll come get you when I can.

14:47.650 --> 14:49.351

14:49.385 --> 14:50.552
Allison, listen, I need
you to be my brave girl.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.787
Okay? Just follow your instincts.

14:52.822 --> 14:55.023

15:34.627 --> 15:36.728
We need to know exactly what she saw.

15:36.762 --> 15:38.263
It's La Mojana.

15:38.297 --> 15:39.731
It's a local legend.

15:39.765 --> 15:41.466
A woman that changes shape,

15:41.500 --> 15:43.935
takes people into the
jungle and eats them.

15:43.970 --> 15:47.339
The cartel encourages it to keep
peasants out of the jungle.

15:47.373 --> 15:50.008
(speaking Spanish)

15:52.411 --> 15:54.479
Si. La Mojana.

15:54.513 --> 15:56.581

15:56.616 --> 15:58.516
We need to get her back to the camp.

15:58.551 --> 15:59.918
(Mato) No, no, no... she stays.

15:59.952 --> 16:01.620
We're walking into a shit storm,

16:01.654 --> 16:03.021
and I need every soldier I got.

16:03.055 --> 16:05.390
She's just a kid.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.925
I'm taking her back.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.394
You got a job to do...

16:09.428 --> 16:10.495
with us.

16:10.529 --> 16:11.830
Flynn's right.

16:11.864 --> 16:14.266
Oh... we got La Mojana out there,

16:14.300 --> 16:15.700

Yo, G.I. Joe Barbie, she's a big girl.

16:18.404 --> 16:20.405
I was slitting
throats when I was her age.

16:21.807 --> 16:23.775
You want your payday
like Jackson promised?

16:23.809 --> 16:26.678
Send your weakest man to take
the girl back to camp,

16:26.712 --> 16:28.513
otherwise, we take her.

16:28.547 --> 16:30.415
And you go home empty-handed.

33:09.736 --> 33:12.104
Regan, if I hadn't have joined the unit,

33:12.139 --> 33:14.774
would you have... contained me?

33:20.480 --> 33:22.548
Not in human form?

33:22.583 --> 33:23.849
Well, what form is it in?

33:23.884 --> 33:25.117
<i>(Regan) I don't know, exactly.</i>

33:25.152 --> 33:27.086
All I know for sure is
that it's a Hunter.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.421
And Mato saw it?

33:28.455 --> 33:29.655
<i>Has he been...</i>

33:29.690 --> 33:31.023
It's been handled.

33:31.058 --> 33:33.659
Your protocol left us shorthanded.

33:33.694 --> 33:36.062
We need additional
support. Eyes in the sky.

33:36.096 --> 33:37.763
<i>(Jackson) I'll see what I can do.</i>

33:37.798 --> 33:39.632
(Carroll) We need it now. Can't
wait till the morning.

33:39.666 --> 33:41.601
<i>- Understood.
- That thing can hunt at night.</i>

33:41.635 --> 33:42.902
It has the advantage.

33:42.936 --> 33:44.737
<i>You have a location on the target?</i>

33:44.771 --> 33:46.479
(Regan) It's injured, scared.

33:46.540 --> 33:47.673
I think it'll head to the mountains.

33:47.708 --> 33:49.408
You think or you know?

33:49.443 --> 33:51.043
(Regan) That's what I would do.

33:51.078 --> 33:52.612
(Jules) That makes
sense with what we understand

33:52.646 --> 33:53.813
about their language.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.581
Higher elevation means more miles

33:55.616 --> 33:57.617
to anticipate potential attacks.

33:57.651 --> 33:59.418
<i>(Jackson) We could have a
drone out there in an hour.</i>

33:59.453 --> 34:00.853
(Jules) And then what happens?

34:00.887 --> 34:02.455
22-year-old kid from Iowa

34:02.489 --> 34:05.057
with an Xbox
controller and a Snowden complex

34:05.092 --> 34:06.659
gets one of these things in his sights?

34:06.693 --> 34:08.060
How do we contain that?

34:08.094 --> 34:10.896
We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

34:10.931 --> 34:12.031
I'll reach out to Langley.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.801
If we wanna catch this
thing, we gotta leave now.

34:15.835 --> 34:18.371
Has ETU ever caught one that
doesn't look like you?

34:18.405 --> 34:21.674
We've never captured
one alive in any form.

34:21.708 --> 34:25.610
Then we better, uh, catch
this one, right?

34:27.447 --> 34:29.382
How we gonna find it in the dark?

34:29.416 --> 34:32.018
You can find anything if
you want it badly enough.

34:35.400 --> 34:39.475
(police radio chatter)

34:41.043 --> 34:42.043
(door buzzes)

34:59.629 --> 35:02.164
(Jackson) Hello, Allison.

35:02.199 --> 35:04.066
My name is Truss Jackson.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.234
Homeland Security.

35:11.074 --> 35:13.309
I'm not here to hurt you.

35:23.854 --> 35:25.855
Stop staring, you dirty old freak.

35:25.889 --> 35:26.989
(chuckling)

35:27.023 --> 35:28.924
What, you never seen a girl before?

35:30.093 --> 35:31.927
Not like you.

35:34.264 --> 35:37.399
I have an... old photograph of you

35:37.434 --> 35:40.469
that I put into the system years ago,

35:40.504 --> 35:44.373
just in case you ever got arrested.

35:44.407 --> 35:46.642
And here you are.

35:50.447 --> 35:52.915
Cute kid.

35:52.949 --> 35:54.316
But that's not me.

35:54.351 --> 35:57.119
Allison Regan of Circleton,
West Virginia.

35:57.153 --> 35:59.355
Daughter of Ted and Liana Regan.

35:59.389 --> 36:01.023
Never heard of 'em.

36:01.057 --> 36:03.893
Disappeared age 16 after a home invasion

36:03.927 --> 36:06.262
by unidentified intruders.

36:06.296 --> 36:10.866
You sure that's not who you are?

36:10.901 --> 36:12.902
(crickets chirping)

36:17.207 --> 36:18.841
(sniffing)

36:26.917 --> 36:29.818
(electronic beeping)

36:29.853 --> 36:30.953
Go.

36:30.987 --> 36:32.421
Langley said no.

36:32.455 --> 36:34.323
<i>- You have to abort.
- Why?</i>

36:34.357 --> 36:35.524
Bullshit!

36:35.559 --> 36:36.919
Without backup, you're vulnerable.

36:36.927 --> 36:38.894
Without a drone, you're blind.

36:38.929 --> 36:40.229
It's too dangerous.

36:40.263 --> 36:42.331
It's injured. We have the advantage.

36:42.365 --> 36:43.933
It's a new form of Hunter.

36:46.937 --> 36:48.003
Abort.

36:48.038 --> 36:49.405
<i>That's an order.</i>

36:49.439 --> 36:52.174
You're breaking up. You said report?

36:52.208 --> 36:54.376
Abort! I said abort.

36:54.411 --> 36:56.612
Copy that! We'll complete the
mission and report, over.

36:56.646 --> 36:58.180
- Carroll!
- (phone beeps off)

36:58.214 --> 36:59.882
We're gonna catch shit for that.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.283
Well, we better make it worth it.

38:47.524 --> 38:51.527
I was with Australian Special
Forces in Afghanistan.

38:51.561 --> 38:54.396
We thought we were
hitting a terrorist cell.

38:54.431 --> 38:56.165
Turned out to be just one guy in a room.

38:56.199 --> 38:58.534
Two of us went in.

38:58.568 --> 39:00.269
Opened fire, both clips.

Nothing.

39:05.575 --> 39:07.309
it leapt at Brendan

39:10.947 --> 39:14.249
But slowly... playfully.

39:14.284 --> 39:15.317
Like a cat.

39:16.653 --> 39:19.188

39:19.222 --> 39:20.422
it kept looking at me.
