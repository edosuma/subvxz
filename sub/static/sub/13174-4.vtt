00:06.500 --> 00:08.037
We're gathered here today

00:08.061 --> 00:13.183
to witness the holy union of
Jess Kato and Todd Hinkle.

00:13.208 --> 00:14.993
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.222
I can.

00:16.247 --> 00:17.829
It's all I've ever wanted.

00:17.854 --> 00:22.642
Todd has chosen to recite his
vows in Jess' native language.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.170
Babe, you learned Japanese for me?!

00:25.195 --> 00:27.408
_

00:27.433 --> 00:28.368
_

00:28.393 --> 00:30.362
Oh, my God!

00:31.257 --> 00:35.442
_

00:35.467 --> 00:39.356
_

00:39.381 --> 00:45.276
_

00:45.301 --> 00:49.722
_

00:49.747 --> 00:54.410
_

00:54.624 --> 00:59.603
_

00:59.628 --> 01:04.453
_

01:05.880 --> 01:07.015
Arigato.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.297
I love you so much.

01:09.322 --> 01:11.425
And now the rings.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.617
My God, babe!

01:17.365 --> 01:18.770
It's so beautiful. Is that...

01:18.795 --> 01:19.995
My Callaway.

01:20.020 --> 01:22.874
I melted it down and forged this ring.

01:23.363 --> 01:26.525
After all, it's just a golf club.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.944
That's what I said!

01:29.246 --> 01:30.921
Todd...

01:31.247 --> 01:35.219
do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

01:35.332 --> 01:37.153
Abso-lutely.

01:37.178 --> 01:38.736
- Yes!
- Forever?

01:38.761 --> 01:41.160
Like, you're 100% sure?

01:41.185 --> 01:42.262
Of course.

01:42.417 --> 01:43.952
It's been seven years.

01:43.986 --> 01:46.289
I think I'd know after seven years.

01:50.260 --> 01:55.000
Then I can now pronounce
you Mr. and Mrs. Todd Kato.

Ohh! Oh!

02:13.215 --> 02:14.416
Todd!

02:14.450 --> 02:16.176
- What? What, what, what, what, what?!
- Todd!

02:16.201 --> 02:19.478
Oh, Jesus! Ew! Who beefed in here?

02:19.503 --> 02:22.415
Oh, Jess, go outside
if you have to fart.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.609
Todd!

02:23.634 --> 02:24.705
What are we doing?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.224
Well, I was trying to sleep.

02:27.249 --> 02:28.773
No, Todd, I'm serious.

02:28.798 --> 02:30.267
We've been together for seven years.

02:30.292 --> 02:32.692
Do you want to build
a life with me or not?

02:33.834 --> 02:35.436
Do I really have to
answer this right now?

02:35.461 --> 02:37.154
Oh, my God!

02:37.179 --> 02:38.704
I'm sleeping outside!

02:38.729 --> 02:40.732
Jess, come on! It's the
middle of the night.

02:40.757 --> 02:42.993
I get sleepy brain. You know that.

02:43.018 --> 02:44.437
Jess!

02:44.462 --> 02:46.429
Jess! Come on!

02:46.899 --> 02:48.984
Bugs out here!

02:49.009 --> 02:50.029
Jess?!

02:50.054 --> 02:52.023
♪♪

02:52.048 --> 02:53.446
Holy hell.

02:53.472 --> 02:54.866
Why is the water so high?

02:55.315 --> 02:56.764
The pile!

02:56.789 --> 02:58.452
Guys!

02:58.961 --> 03:00.531
Guys!

03:00.975 --> 03:02.419
The stuff!

03:02.444 --> 03:05.643
All the chips... so many chips!

03:05.668 --> 03:06.612
Hurry!

03:06.637 --> 03:08.456
The tide is gonna take...

03:10.999 --> 03:14.152
...all the stuff.

03:17.437 --> 03:18.610
Yep.

03:18.635 --> 03:20.464
Yep, looks like the tide got

03:20.489 --> 03:22.392
the community pile during the night.

03:22.417 --> 03:23.936
The ocean can be a fickle bitch.

03:23.961 --> 03:25.206
Wait, so all the airline food

03:25.231 --> 03:26.763
and sun block and first-aid stuff...

03:26.788 --> 03:28.011
It's all just gone?

03:28.036 --> 03:29.620
The only thing left are those two bags,

03:29.645 --> 03:31.022
and they're both completely empty.

03:31.173 --> 03:33.545
And I haven't been able to catch
any boar in a couple of days.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.347
Damn it! Whose genius idea was it

03:36.372 --> 03:37.967
to put all of our stuff
next to the water?

03:37.992 --> 03:39.791
Well, at this point,
does it even matter?

03:39.816 --> 03:40.688
It was Turdhole's.

03:40.713 --> 03:41.909
Oh, come on, Karen!

03:41.934 --> 03:43.694
I didn't want the jungle bugs to get in.

03:43.719 --> 03:45.455
You shitting me, Turdhole?!

03:45.480 --> 03:47.224
I should kill you.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.007
Oh!

03:49.032 --> 03:50.783
I'm so tired of this island.

03:51.074 --> 03:52.509
Pack...

03:52.534 --> 03:55.622
think of it as your
sacrifice to the ocean.

03:55.647 --> 03:59.585
Enjoy those peanut butter-filled
pretzels, Mother Gaia.

03:59.611 --> 04:00.618
Are you high right now?

04:00.643 --> 04:02.258
A little bit, yeah.

04:03.051 --> 04:04.921
Hey, Jess, I need to talk to you.

04:04.946 --> 04:05.975
What do you want, Todd?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.295
Meet me in the tent in 10, please.

04:11.825 --> 04:13.226
Owen: Okay.

04:13.539 --> 04:15.928
Relax. You can do this.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.579
Deep breath.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.894
Owen, hurry up, I got to go!

04:27.919 --> 04:29.388
I'm going, okay?

04:29.413 --> 04:32.756
Okay.

04:32.781 --> 04:33.900
You're in a safe place.

04:33.925 --> 04:37.127
You're in a beautiful marble bathroom.

04:37.456 --> 04:39.342
What do you got? What do you got here?

04:39.367 --> 04:42.330
There's a big... big old roll
of double-ply right there.

04:42.355 --> 04:43.961
Okay. Here we go.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.303
Other people have to
use the shit hole...

04:49.328 --> 04:50.974
Diane, I am going!

04:50.999 --> 04:53.102
One second!

04:53.615 --> 04:54.910
Whew.

04:56.128 --> 04:57.909
Nobody's here. Nobody's here.

04:57.935 --> 05:01.738
You are all alone.

05:01.763 --> 05:04.189
Owen, it has been half an hour!

05:04.213 --> 05:05.813
Don't look at me!

05:05.839 --> 05:08.133
What do you want, Todd?

05:11.371 --> 05:12.772
Oh, my God!

05:12.797 --> 05:13.972
Jess?

05:13.996 --> 05:15.441
Babe?

05:15.467 --> 05:17.020
Will you...

05:17.045 --> 05:19.564
check this shit out!

05:20.089 --> 05:21.548
W-What?

05:21.573 --> 05:22.916
What... What is this?

05:22.941 --> 05:25.044
It's the community pile. I saved it,

05:25.069 --> 05:26.821
and now everyone thinks it's gone.

05:26.846 --> 05:29.020
How rad is that?

05:29.434 --> 05:30.956
Why do you look so disappointed?

05:30.981 --> 05:33.362
No, no, no. There's, like,
a ton of beef jerky in here.

05:33.387 --> 05:34.703
This stuff belongs to everyone, okay?

05:34.728 --> 05:36.467
No, no, no, no. They think it's gone.

05:36.492 --> 05:37.835
This is ours now.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.096
Jess...

05:39.407 --> 05:41.307
Baby, this is for us.

05:41.332 --> 05:42.731
All right, remember what you said.

05:42.756 --> 05:43.987
You want to build a life together.

05:44.012 --> 05:45.747
Well, that's what I'm trying to do.

05:45.772 --> 05:47.736
And this... this can be...

05:47.761 --> 05:49.593
our nest egg.

05:51.034 --> 05:53.425
Oh, my God, you are so unbelievable!

05:53.961 --> 05:55.585
What are you talking about?!

05:55.610 --> 05:57.759
When I said that, Todd, I
wasn't talking about things.

05:57.784 --> 06:00.189
- Hey, keep your voice down.
- I was talking about a proposal.

06:00.214 --> 06:00.837
What?!

06:04.159 --> 06:08.126
I thought you were going to
propose to me on this trip.

06:08.151 --> 06:11.122
But instead, it was a
"Hangover 2" locations tour.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.817
You love the Wolf Pack.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.645
When I first met you,

06:16.670 --> 06:18.668
I thought you were the
coolest senior at ASU.

06:18.693 --> 06:20.128
- I was.
- And when we both graduated,

06:20.153 --> 06:23.550
I followed you to Scottsdale
because we had fun together.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.469
But now...

06:26.408 --> 06:28.206
...I need something more.

06:28.541 --> 06:30.398
Okay, Jess, just...

06:30.423 --> 06:31.502
Return the stuff

06:31.527 --> 06:34.678
or I'll tell everyone you took it.

06:42.577 --> 06:43.545
Pack: Chet?

06:43.579 --> 06:44.614
Chet?!

06:44.646 --> 06:46.789
Chet?! Chet?!

06:46.814 --> 06:48.282
Oh, hi. Hey, whoa.

06:48.314 --> 06:50.026
Hey, little man. What's up?

06:50.051 --> 06:51.185
I'm done with this island.

06:51.217 --> 06:53.320
There's no food. It's all
in the water somewhere.

06:53.345 --> 06:56.208
I'm starving. I'm covered
in rashes right now.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.453
I don't have my jacket anymore.

06:57.478 --> 06:58.871
You want to know why?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.264
That dude's wearing it.

07:00.322 --> 07:01.853
Okay, it doesn't even fit him!

07:01.878 --> 07:04.448
And I can't get it back because
he doesn't know English.

07:04.473 --> 07:07.184
So whatever it is that has you all chill

07:07.209 --> 07:09.985
and totally okay with
dying here, I want in.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.526
I want to do your drugs.

07:11.551 --> 07:15.720
Buddy, drugs are for
expansion, not escapesion.

07:15.964 --> 07:19.408
You do not want drugs.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.803
Yes... I... do.

07:25.146 --> 07:26.514
- All right.
- Great.

07:26.539 --> 07:27.498
But you got to promise to expand.

07:27.523 --> 07:29.695
Yeah, yeah, I'll open up my
mind, whatever, expansion.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.338
Dope, dope, dope, dope.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.264
Beautiful.

07:32.289 --> 07:33.691
Follow me.

07:33.716 --> 07:35.896
What? Where are we going?
Why can't we do drugs here?

07:35.921 --> 07:39.136
Easy! First I'm gonna take
you on a vision quest, man.

07:39.161 --> 07:41.480
We're gonna explore your unconscious.

07:41.505 --> 07:42.823
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

07:42.847 --> 07:46.112
I, for one, am very excited
about being inside you.

07:46.137 --> 07:48.384
That's very weird. Don't say that.

07:49.581 --> 07:50.981
Hey, where's my SkyMall?

07:51.006 --> 07:52.734
I lost it. Okay?

07:52.759 --> 07:54.688
Yeesh! What's up with you?

07:54.713 --> 07:57.681
I don't know, Danny. Maybe
it's that we're starving.

07:57.705 --> 08:01.335
Or maybe that it feels like a
hot fart outside all the time.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.589
Owen, come on. It's me. What's going on?

08:08.112 --> 08:13.375
Ever since the crash, I
have not been able to, uh...

08:14.250 --> 08:16.525
- To go.
- To go?

08:16.550 --> 08:18.187
- To evacuate.
- Evacuate, like the plane?

08:18.212 --> 08:19.847
To go, dude. I haven't been able to go.

08:19.872 --> 08:20.952
To go? Where do you have
to go? We're on the island.

08:20.977 --> 08:22.045
We're kind of stuck here.

08:22.070 --> 08:23.272
To go.

08:23.651 --> 08:25.299
- Like poop?
- Yeah, poop.

08:25.324 --> 08:27.208
Oh. Owen, it's been like two weeks.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.175
- Has it been two weeks?
- I think.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.959
Oh, my G... I know it's
been two weeks, man.

08:31.984 --> 08:32.767
I'm just...

08:32.792 --> 08:35.648
There's people everywhere, always.

08:35.673 --> 08:37.903
And I have to be alone.

08:38.754 --> 08:41.328
All right. Come with me.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.967
There's something I need to show you.

08:47.856 --> 08:49.124
Todd?

08:49.149 --> 08:51.516
I gave you a chance
to tell them yourself.

08:51.649 --> 08:54.295
Fine. Coming in!

08:56.149 --> 08:57.502
Oh, hey.

08:57.527 --> 08:58.368
What's happening?

08:58.393 --> 09:01.335
Look, Jess, the truth is,

09:01.359 --> 09:03.926
I was going to propose
to you on this trip.

09:03.951 --> 09:05.119
I was just...

09:05.144 --> 09:07.119
waiting for the perfect moment.

09:07.785 --> 09:09.711
But then I realized...

09:10.794 --> 09:15.725
that every moment with
you is perfection.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.384
Jess...

09:18.409 --> 09:20.596
will you marry me?

09:20.621 --> 09:22.371
Oh, my God!

09:22.397 --> 09:24.556
Babe, yes, of course!

09:24.580 --> 09:26.355
Dope.

09:26.381 --> 09:29.170
And you won't tell anyone
about the stuff, right?

09:29.297 --> 09:30.631
What?

09:30.655 --> 09:32.292
Oh, God, Jess.

09:32.563 --> 09:34.633
Look, if I didn't save this crap,

09:34.658 --> 09:36.104
the tide would have swept it away.

09:36.129 --> 09:38.976
We can't trust those
dodo brains out there.

09:39.465 --> 09:41.266
We can only trust each other.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.904
I-I guess, I...

09:42.929 --> 09:45.132
Babe, are we a team?

09:45.463 --> 09:47.303
Or not?

09:50.004 --> 09:51.519
Hell yeah, we are.

09:51.544 --> 09:52.543
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoo!

09:52.568 --> 09:54.567
Ow!

09:54.592 --> 09:55.983
I knew you'd say yes.

09:56.009 --> 09:58.383
I knew you'd waffle,
and then you'd cave.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.223
Danny, where are you taking me?

10:01.248 --> 10:01.920
Shh!

10:01.945 --> 10:04.191
Don't shush! I am a grown man.

10:04.217 --> 10:06.320
What could be so secret you shush me?

10:07.043 --> 10:08.865
That.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.249
Mother of God.

10:11.274 --> 10:15.170
The center cabin bathroom.
It just landed here?

10:15.195 --> 10:16.938
I found it a few days ago.

10:17.038 --> 10:19.440
Had I known, I would
have told you earlier.

10:19.465 --> 10:20.899
I'm a shy pooper myself.

10:20.924 --> 10:21.610
Jesus!

10:21.635 --> 10:24.019
- Have you told anyone about this?
- No.

10:24.044 --> 10:26.505
The others, they cannot
find this, Danny.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.586
They're animals. They're animals, Danny!

10:28.611 --> 10:30.301
- They'll tear it apart.
- Owen! Owen, Owen...

10:30.326 --> 10:32.261
You're safe here, okay?

10:32.286 --> 10:35.118
This will just be our little secret.

10:36.976 --> 10:38.870
Danny, thank you.

10:39.335 --> 10:40.991
Thank you.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.462
Yeah.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.178
Oh, my God, this is so good.

11:04.203 --> 11:06.987
Yeah. Melty Pop-Tarts are the best.

11:07.012 --> 11:07.848
Mm-hmm.

11:07.873 --> 11:10.169
And anyone who doesn't like
Brown Sugar-Cinnamon...

11:10.573 --> 11:12.297
can go to Hell.

11:12.322 --> 11:13.952
I have to admit,

11:13.977 --> 11:16.384
it is very nice having sun block.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.103
Yeah, well...

11:18.128 --> 11:21.265
maybe your future husband
isn't so selfish after all.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.376
Maybe not.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.126
What the hell was that?

11:27.151 --> 11:27.630
I don't know.

11:27.655 --> 11:28.863
All right. Hold on.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.289
- Go check it out.
- Hold on.

11:30.313 --> 11:31.647
Stay here.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.519
Whoa! Awesome!

11:45.544 --> 11:47.519
What are they fighting over?

11:47.545 --> 11:48.759
Airline pretzels.

11:48.784 --> 11:50.235
They're fighting over airline pretzels?

11:50.261 --> 11:52.589
It's the only food we have left.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.348
Finish him!

11:56.917 --> 11:58.389
Oh! Yeah.

11:58.414 --> 11:59.589
Whoa.

11:59.614 --> 12:01.709
Oh, wow.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.965
These guys must really
be hungry, then, huh?

12:06.105 --> 12:08.188
Is that brown sugar-cinnamon
on your mouth?

12:08.213 --> 12:11.268
What? No, the Pop-Tarts
washed out to sea.

12:11.293 --> 12:12.604
Let me taste it.

12:12.629 --> 12:14.066
- Taste?
- Come on. Let me taste it.

12:14.091 --> 12:15.972
Hey, hey! Hey, no, no, no!

12:15.997 --> 12:19.364

12:21.927 --> 12:24.365
Isn't it glorious, Pack?

12:24.515 --> 12:26.086
You know the Iroquois Nation

12:26.111 --> 12:28.501
used to call their
land chimi-chok chok...

12:28.634 --> 12:30.262
for "sacred mother."

12:30.287 --> 12:32.958
How did they say, "Can we
do the drugs now, please?!"

12:32.982 --> 12:34.317
Look around, man!

12:34.342 --> 12:35.998
Get high on this, brother.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.616
Listen to that waterfall.

12:37.641 --> 12:38.771
Just trees and bullshit.

12:38.796 --> 12:41.206
Just do me a favor. Open one eye.

12:41.231 --> 12:42.638
Open the other eye.

12:42.663 --> 12:43.982
Now see.

12:44.007 --> 12:45.894
Okay? What else do you need?

12:45.918 --> 12:48.053
What about my Audi?! Huh?

12:48.078 --> 12:51.420
I just bought a charcoal-gray Audi.

12:51.445 --> 12:57.319
Buddy, it's just rubber and
metal and whistles and glass.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.447
Who cares about your
Audi? Your legs, dude!

12:59.472 --> 13:00.587
Don't... All right, don't.

13:00.612 --> 13:02.918
Your legs are flesh Audis.

13:02.943 --> 13:04.188
Yeah, I'm out of here, man.

13:04.213 --> 13:07.717
Thank you, Chet, for this
enormous waste of time!

13:07.742 --> 13:09.785
I just want to do drugs, okay?

13:09.810 --> 13:11.145

existential search for wisdom,

It's got to be a mistake.

20:11.271 --> 20:13.711
Uh, no, I don't think so.
I'm gonna stay on the beach.

20:13.736 --> 20:16.341
Can you imagine going into
the jungle by yourself?

20:16.367 --> 20:19.093
Especially at night?
Oh, hell no, no way.

20:20.479 --> 20:22.592
Hello!

20:22.617 --> 20:24.686
Anybody!

20:24.711 --> 20:26.399
Shit! What the

20:26.424 --> 20:27.903
What the shit was that?!

20:27.928 --> 20:29.421
Hey, what's going on?

20:29.445 --> 20:30.606
Where's our stuff?!

20:30.631 --> 20:31.646
It was in here!

20:31.671 --> 20:32.706
What is this, a joke?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.374
I told you I don't get many jokes.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.526
It was in here, Karen, I swear.

20:36.551 --> 20:38.767
Todd: Hey, boners!

20:39.015 --> 20:41.167
It's all gone!

20:41.192 --> 20:42.615
I hid it.

20:42.859 --> 20:46.423
From now on, I control the stuff!

20:46.448 --> 20:49.104
God damn it, Todd! Who
do you think you are?!

20:49.129 --> 20:53.801
I'm the friggin' king of the island!

20:53.826 --> 20:56.647
Yeah!

20:56.672 --> 20:59.008
Ooh!

20:59.033 --> 21:01.369
Whoo!

21:01.600 --> 21:02.703
Whoo!
