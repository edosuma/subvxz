01:14.740 --> 01:17.351
Hey, buddy, what's up?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.680
Okay.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.651
What do you say we turn
that frown upside down?

01:29.440 --> 01:31.520
It's a little early for that, isn't it?

01:32.200 --> 01:36.871
Are you kidding me? Out here
it's never too early for a cold one.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.780
All right, let's go for a walk.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.691
Might do you some good.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.751
Come on.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.199
- You look like shit.
- Thanks.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.780
You're welcome.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.980
Get enough sleep?

02:14.060 --> 02:15.871
Rough night.

02:16.260 --> 02:19.671
- Nightmares back again?
- Never left.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.691
This one was a little different,
but they always end the same with her in...

02:26.320 --> 02:28.600
Look, man, we don't have to keep doing this.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.291
Yes, we do, it's why I'm here.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.388
Man, you've got to do something
about those dreams of yours.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.091
Tried.

02:39.318 --> 02:42.180
They're just getting harder
and harder to shake.

02:42.910 --> 02:45.401
Then move on.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.383
I can't do that, Alex, you know that.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.620
The tree over there is where
I met Anna for the first time.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.920
Down here by the water
is where we had our first kiss.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.831
This is her home, our home.

03:06.980 --> 03:10.791
I tried to leave, but I can't.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.781
It's just... I can't.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.753
You always did love the sunsets.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.640
Every sunset is beautiful.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.040
Remember that day down by the lake?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.780
It was a lot of fun, good times.

03:41.860 --> 03:43.691
Of course I do.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.900
Simpler time, when we were happy.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.891
What do you mean? We're happy now, aren't we?

04:00.640 --> 04:04.360
I had a dream about you last night.
Been dreaming about you a lot lately.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.431
What do you suppose that means?
You were out in the lake by yourself, rowing.

04:08.511 --> 04:12.180
I was calling and calling for you,
but you wouldn't answer.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.300
I don't know, maybe you couldn't
hear me all the way out there.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.810
I mean, it was a dream, after all.

04:18.839 --> 04:22.132
And then you turned to me
and you waved. And like that...

04:23.312 --> 04:25.211
...you were gone.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.100
It's hard to believe just how quickly
the darkness creeps in all the way out here.

04:34.780 --> 04:38.051
- The night will fall.
- What did you say?

04:49.340 --> 04:50.896
Anna.

04:51.649 --> 04:54.500
No! No!

05:20.120 --> 05:22.721
Hey, buddy, everything okay?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.730
I, um...

05:26.048 --> 05:29.460
- ...sorry for calling so late.
- It's okay, man, I'm still working.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.351
What's up?

05:33.740 --> 05:36.991
- Brett, you there?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

05:38.480 --> 05:40.160
You were right.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.713
I need to get away from this place.

05:43.997 --> 05:46.266
You want me to make the call or not?

05:47.140 --> 05:49.380
You really think I should go to Sofia?

05:49.460 --> 05:51.271
I do.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.437
It's an amazing city and with your
background you're a perfect fit for the gig.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.640
Go try it for a few weeks.
If you don't like it, come back here...

06:00.720 --> 06:03.925
...and we'll get back to drinking beer,
figure something else out.

06:04.005 --> 06:05.572
Thanks.

06:06.290 --> 06:08.892
- Well?
- Who's the client?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.136
Let's make the call and find out.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.792
Make the call.

06:21.070 --> 06:23.610
- You ready?
- I'm ready, I'll call you when I get there.

06:23.690 --> 06:27.010
Are you sure? And remember,
you don't like it, we go to plan B.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.970
What's plan B?

06:29.050 --> 06:31.630
There is no plan B,
now get the fuck out of here.

06:31.710 --> 06:34.659
- Take care of her for me, all right?
- Yeah.

07:37.830 --> 07:40.030
Ah, American?

07:40.110 --> 07:42.110
Yeah, Los Angeles.

07:42.190 --> 07:45.012
I... I speak American.

07:46.250 --> 07:51.110
I mean, I speak English,
but you know what I mean.

07:51.190 --> 07:54.659
Where do you learn to speak Bulgarian?

07:55.150 --> 07:59.030
My wife. I've lived in Varna
for the last three years.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.610
A little rusty though.

08:01.690 --> 08:05.572
Haven't... don't really
speak it much anymore.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.088
It survived the bombing.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.012
Excuse me?

09:25.350 --> 09:27.130
The building.

09:27.210 --> 09:30.150
You were wondering why it looks
so out of place in a street like this.

09:30.230 --> 09:33.274
- Okay.
- It was the only one that survived.

09:34.390 --> 09:38.230
- The rogue missile back in '99 hit here?
- Oh, no, that was further out.

09:38.310 --> 09:42.990
Closer to the Serbian border, in fact.
This building is much older than that.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.592
Sorry.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.330
Who are ya?

09:47.410 --> 09:50.270
I'm sorry. Please, forgive my manners.

09:50.950 --> 09:56.030
I'm Martin Barker and this here
is my associate, Goran Stoichkov.

09:56.110 --> 10:01.057
We've been expecting you, Mr. Anderson.
Or may I call you Brett?

10:01.137 --> 10:06.070
- Brett's good. So you two own this place?
- No, Martin runs it and I assist him...

10:06.150 --> 10:09.616
...but the property actually
belongs to a firm in the US.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.470
Let's go inside.

10:12.550 --> 10:15.827
Do the interview in my office,
I can show you around.

10:35.650 --> 10:37.172
Wow.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.654
Impressive.

10:40.734 --> 10:43.770
Yes. It's really something else, isn't it?

10:44.450 --> 10:46.192
Come on inside.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.690
Tell me, Brett.

11:00.070 --> 11:04.861
How many years have you been
at the Los Angeles Police Department?

11:04.941 --> 11:07.192
15, retired four.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.390
How many years have you been living in Varna?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.890
Uh, three years and some change.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.839
If you don't mind me asking...

11:15.919 --> 11:18.566
...why Varna? I mean...

11:18.946 --> 11:21.410
...it's a strange choice for an American.

11:21.990 --> 11:25.289
Went there on vacation and never left.

11:25.369 --> 11:28.370
Varna is where you met your wife, correct?

11:29.650 --> 11:31.450
My wife?

11:31.530 --> 11:34.290
Yeah, I met her at a lake there.
What does that have to do with the interview?

11:34.370 --> 11:36.779
I must apologize, Brett, but...

11:36.859 --> 11:39.910
...I'm sure you can understand
given the position on offer...

11:39.990 --> 11:42.570
...it's important for us to know
as much as we possibly can...

11:42.650 --> 11:45.284
...about any potential candidate.

11:45.364 --> 11:47.090
Maybe I missed something
on the job description...

11:47.170 --> 11:50.590
...but what does my dead wife have
to do with me being hired or not?

11:50.670 --> 11:53.472
I'm sorry, Brett. I...

11:54.090 --> 11:56.972
...we didn't mean to offend.

11:57.310 --> 12:02.590
It's just that the company
we work for is a little bit particular...

12:02.670 --> 12:07.112
...about who they employ
as security here at the Zahari.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.380
Please.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.372
Forgive me.

12:11.790 --> 12:14.550
And I am sorry about your wife.

12:14.630 --> 12:15.810
Thank you.

12:15.890 --> 12:19.898
Do you have any plans to return
to the U.S., Mr. Anderson?

12:20.290 --> 12:24.470
Call me Brett. And no,
I consider Varna my home now.

12:24.550 --> 12:26.772
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.630
You don't speak any Bulgarian, do you?

12:31.710 --> 12:36.470
Ah, a little. Enough to make
myself understood, you know.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.630
In any case, language isn't really...

12:39.710 --> 12:42.470
...an essential requirement for the job.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.690
But I think that's good to know.

12:44.770 --> 12:47.392
So what is an essential requirement?

12:49.890 --> 12:52.550
Well, whilst there's nothing...

12:52.630 --> 12:56.350
...particularly demanding
about your position...

12:56.430 --> 13:00.550
...Goran and I, and more
importantly the management...

13:00.630 --> 13:04.810
...expect a certain type of discretion.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.790
I see.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.210
So, what kind of business
do you guys run out of this place...

13:10.290 --> 13:13.670
...other than four apartments
in a three story building?

13:13.750 --> 13:16.296
Sorry for the questions,
you know, old habits die hard.

13:16.376 --> 13:18.110
It's perfectly okay.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.415
We store our own products
in the basement of the building...

13:20.495 --> 13:24.670
...and we run a property real
estate company out of the office.

13:24.750 --> 13:28.630
You know, it generates a little bit
extra money, income throughout the year.

13:28.710 --> 13:30.932
What sort of products?

13:35.450 --> 13:36.972
Come.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.490
Let me show you something.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.970
This elevator is nearly
as old as the building itself.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.270
Judging by that key I can tell.

13:45.850 --> 13:48.830
It's old, but it definitely works.

13:48.910 --> 13:51.365
Maybe we should take the stairs?

13:51.990 --> 13:53.630
I want to show you the basement.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.030
And the only way to the basement
is with this elevator.

13:56.110 --> 13:57.490
What if there is a power outage?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.630
It automatically switches
to a hydraulic system.

14:00.710 --> 14:04.251
There is a panic button that is
wired directly to our office...

14:04.331 --> 14:06.390
...as well as our cell phones.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.764
In any case, that's never happened.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.628
Hope it stays that way.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.410
Fascinating.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.130
Certainly is.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.310
- What's on the top floor?
- The penthouse.

14:31.390 --> 14:35.012
The owner of the company stays
in the building from time to time.

14:36.290 --> 14:40.410
So, you have to use the key
every single time you use the lift?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.970
Every time. Won't work otherwise.

14:43.050 --> 14:47.292
There's two keys. I have one
on me all time. You have the other.

14:56.870 --> 14:59.139
The basement is deep underground.

15:00.970 --> 15:02.812
Takes a minute.

15:09.650 --> 15:13.423
You're going to need the key
to get in the basement as well.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.133
This way, please.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.950
In here you start the most
important part of your routine.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.750
8:00 a.m. sharp, every morning.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.870
Some pretty vintage equipment you got here.

15:40.950 --> 15:43.030
It all serves a purpose.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.170
What are all the monitors for?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.073
Follow me.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.113
Wow.

16:08.490 --> 16:11.110
What do you keep back there, King Kong?

16:11.190 --> 16:12.870
This is our storage hangar.

16:12.950 --> 16:16.373
We seldom use it and you won't
ever need to venture inside.

16:22.910 --> 16:24.670
What do these symbols mean?

16:24.750 --> 16:29.950
What we discovered is these are actually
letters from the Enochian alphabet.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.250
Unfortunately,
we just don't know what they mean.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.830
It's pretty sturdy as you can see.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.670
Yeah, makes you wonder what it was built for.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.131
Anyway. The monitors in the other room...

16:40.211 --> 16:43.813
...are connected to security cameras
inside the hangar. Come.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.870
All the cameras are connected
to this computer...

16:54.950 --> 16:57.890
...which records 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

16:57.970 --> 16:59.690
How do you see anything
with the lighting in there?

16:59.770 --> 17:01.770
We had the building rewired
a few years ago.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.930
Just didn't have time to do the hangar.

17:04.010 --> 17:06.846
So until we do, this is all we got.

17:08.470 --> 17:09.710
Is there sand on the floor?

17:09.790 --> 17:11.589
The inside of the hangar was never finished.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.470
So yes, what you are
looking at is grit and sand.

17:14.550 --> 17:19.030
So, say I take this job. What exactly
is it that I do when I come down here?

17:19.109 --> 17:22.930
Okay. You use this computer
to check recordings every day...

17:23.010 --> 17:26.130
...twice a day. It's a simple piece
of software which is designed...

17:26.210 --> 17:28.990
...to red-flag anything out of the ordinary.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.990
All you have to do is click...

17:32.070 --> 17:35.845
...on one of the flagged recordings
and it brings it up on the screen.

17:35.925 --> 17:37.730
There's a log book over there.

17:37.810 --> 17:40.870
You need to sign it and fill it out
every time you come down.

17:40.950 --> 17:43.907
- When was the last time something came up?
- Never.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.710
What do you need all the cameras for then?

17:47.790 --> 17:50.030
To protect our interest.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.150
How large is this space?

17:52.230 --> 17:56.450
Cameras have been placed throughout
so we can see what we need to see.

17:56.530 --> 18:00.450
That is if you can see anything at all.
I mean, I never go in there?

18:00.530 --> 18:03.670
No. Just come down, check the recordings...

18:03.750 --> 18:06.027
...and make sure you fill that log book out.

18:06.630 --> 18:10.990
But if you notice anything out of
the ordinary, and we mean any...

18:11.070 --> 18:14.024
Goran's trying to say...

18:14.104 --> 18:18.790
...is even if you get the slightest
inkling of something strange...

18:19.370 --> 18:22.593
...you have to let us know
as soon as possible.

18:24.090 --> 18:25.459
Like what?

18:25.539 --> 18:29.850
I wouldn't worry about it. I mean,
you've seen the size of the door, right?

18:29.930 --> 18:32.616
- That's a good point.
- However...

18:32.696 --> 18:36.510
...if you do see something strange, use this.

18:36.590 --> 18:39.310
You press speed dial one...

18:39.390 --> 18:41.830
...and someone will answer
and instruct you what to do.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.750
- Someone?
- An employee.

18:44.830 --> 18:48.510
- Consultant, if you might.
- So, that's it?

18:48.590 --> 18:50.613
That's it.

18:55.990 --> 18:59.746
- Milan said something about an apartment.
- Yes. There's a two bedroom apartment...

18:59.826 --> 19:01.810
...on the first floor.

19:01.890 --> 19:05.390
I mean, it's small, but it's cozy.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.130
Has cable TV and all the bells and whistles.

19:09.710 --> 19:12.913
So, but that's only if you're interested.

19:15.350 --> 19:18.153
- I'm interested.
- Great news.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.268
Welcome aboard.

19:20.348 --> 19:23.790
We'll need to sign some papers upstairs.
Then we can show you where you are staying.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.727
Alright.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.753
Welcome to your new home.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.350
You should find everything you need in here.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.953
This is great.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.810
Thanks.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.250
Here's my contact details.

20:00.330 --> 20:04.490
We are not here every day,
so if you need anything at all just call.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.251
- When do I start?
- Tomorrow.

20:09.610 --> 20:12.727
One last thing. Please remember...

20:12.807 --> 20:15.430
...to always lock the front main entrance...

20:15.510 --> 20:18.790
...every night, 11:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.

20:19.370 --> 20:20.490
That's it.

20:20.570 --> 20:23.710
I'll drop by later to leave the keys
to the main entrance.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.074
Great. Where do I get
a bite to eat around here?

20:26.154 --> 20:30.130
There's a restaurant across the street
or you can try the cafÃ© around the corner.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.033
Alright.

20:33.730 --> 20:36.950
- Thank you.
- Oh, and Brett...

20:37.030 --> 20:38.390
Yeah?

20:38.470 --> 20:40.326
Make yourself at home.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.433
Hello?

22:32.558 --> 22:34.101
Hello?

22:41.130 --> 22:42.553
Sorry.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.033
Wait!

22:54.810 --> 22:57.893
Yeah, these guys, uh,
they are a little strange.

22:57.973 --> 23:02.836
And I think I almost gave the cleaning lady
a heart attack when I bumped into her.

23:03.910 --> 23:06.550
Yeah, just scared the crap out of her is all.

23:06.890 --> 23:10.270
But you're right about this job being
a walk in the park, there's nothing to it.

23:10.350 --> 23:13.196
Yeah, I don't really do anything.
I'm just being paid to...

23:13.276 --> 23:15.513
...I guess, watch a bunch of empty rooms.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.933
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

23:23.050 --> 23:25.930
Thanks, man. Well, maybe
you should consider visiting me.

23:26.010 --> 23:29.670
Maybe you'd actually be inspired to write
something that people would want to read.

23:30.622 --> 23:34.310
I'm just saying, man, I've read coloring
books with better character development.

23:36.390 --> 23:38.257
All right, bye.

23:48.530 --> 23:50.570
American coffee, please.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.770
Uh, you don't want that shit.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.500
- Can I offer you a real coffee instead?
- Well, I happen to love that shit...

23:57.580 --> 24:01.250
...but sure, I'll go ahead and try
one of your so-called coffees, sure.

24:01.330 --> 24:03.210
Take a seat.

24:07.470 --> 24:10.096
I saw you yesterday in the cab...

24:10.176 --> 24:12.264
...while I was cleaning outside.

24:14.290 --> 24:15.350
Visiting someone?

24:15.430 --> 24:18.074
Actually I just took a job around the corner.

24:18.610 --> 24:23.013
At the Zahari? I thought that place
was some sort of a retirement home.

24:25.970 --> 24:28.493
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what it is.

24:34.470 --> 24:36.110
Not bad.

24:36.190 --> 24:37.993
Told you.

24:40.490 --> 24:43.130
- Brett.
- Welcome to Sofia, Brett.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.050
I'm Zara.

24:45.130 --> 24:49.213
Uh, so, um, what kind of work
do you do over there at the Zahari?

24:49.293 --> 24:51.310
- Security.
- Security?

24:51.390 --> 24:55.370
For what? I never see anybody
going or coming from that place.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.928
When I figure it out I'll let you know.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.808
Is this your place?

25:02.170 --> 25:04.870
No, I just... I just work here.

25:04.950 --> 25:07.410
This pays the bills
while I study for my Masters.

25:07.490 --> 25:10.713
- What are you majoring in?
- Art history.

25:11.810 --> 25:13.228
So...

25:14.007 --> 25:15.809
...pleasure to meet you.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.743
The pleasure is all mine.

26:14.410 --> 26:16.233
Christ, Brett.

27:26.890 --> 27:29.550
- Coffee?
- Please.

27:29.630 --> 27:31.592
Did you catch that storm the other night?

27:31.672 --> 27:33.790
- Yeah.
- Kept me up all night.

27:33.870 --> 27:35.777
End of the world, I tell you.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.273
I saw a removal van parked outside.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.113
All moved in?

27:42.560 --> 27:44.830
Are you spying on me, Zara?

27:45.410 --> 27:47.247
No, I...

27:47.669 --> 27:51.324
...there's nothing else to do around
these parts except watch people.

27:58.630 --> 28:01.290
So, tell me, Brett...

28:01.370 --> 28:06.090
...how does an American man wind up
in Bulgaria working as a security guard?

28:06.170 --> 28:08.974
It's a long story, but...

28:09.054 --> 28:12.630
...the short version is is once upon
a time I was a cop in Los Angeles.

28:12.710 --> 28:16.113
- So a security job seemed to fit.
- And you what...

28:16.193 --> 28:20.010
...came to Bulgaria just to watch
other people's stuff?

28:20.710 --> 28:23.050
Not exactly. I flew in from Varna.

28:23.130 --> 28:26.590
That's where I live. Well, lived.

28:26.670 --> 28:28.640
Live, lived?

28:28.720 --> 28:31.149
Yeah, it's a long story, like I said.

28:32.060 --> 28:36.030
- I retired there.
- A little young to be retired, aren't you?

28:36.110 --> 28:38.024
I'll take that as a compliment, thank you.

28:40.330 --> 28:43.890
Did you know that your building
is quite famous around these parts?

28:43.970 --> 28:45.920
There are a lot of history
behind those walls.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.957
Yes, so people keep telling me.

28:49.310 --> 28:53.353
I've only ever read about it,
never actually been inside but...

28:54.430 --> 28:58.264
...this place has weathered
a lot over the years.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.230
- Never been inside?
- Uh, no.

29:02.410 --> 29:05.770
Yeah, well, maybe sometime you can come by...

29:05.850 --> 29:08.670
...I could show you around.
I mean, it's pretty spectacular inside.

29:08.750 --> 29:12.440
It would also liven up
what is usually a very boring day.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.792
Call me and we'll set something up.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.193
I would if I had your number.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.213
Let me see your phone.

29:28.790 --> 29:30.799
Well, now you do.

30:33.030 --> 30:34.833
What the...

30:56.490 --> 30:58.535
- <i>Ya?</i>
- Yeah, um...

30:58.615 --> 31:02.513
...I was told to call
this number if something...

31:03.250 --> 31:05.210
<i>What's the problem, Mr. Anderson?</i>

31:05.290 --> 31:08.803
Uh, well, actually I'm not sure.

31:08.883 --> 31:12.333
I'm not even positive I saw
something, it's just that...

31:12.990 --> 31:16.430
<i>I'm on the way, Mr. Anderson.
Meet me at the front of the building...</i>

31:16.510 --> 31:19.130
<i>...in, shall we say, 15 minutes?</i>

31:19.710 --> 31:21.190
Sure.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.122
Who is this I'm talking to?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.074
Hello?

31:27.306 --> 31:28.855
Hello?

31:53.630 --> 31:55.453
Wait please.

31:58.130 --> 32:00.790
- Mr. Anderson?
- Uh, yeah.

32:00.870 --> 32:03.333
- Sorry, I didn't realize...
- Don't worry, Mr. Anderson...

32:03.413 --> 32:06.790
...you're not the first.
And you certainly won't be the last.

32:06.870 --> 32:08.393
Jacob.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.900
Pleasure to meet you, Jacob.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.775
He's been paid, Mr. Anderson.

32:16.830 --> 32:19.410
- It's Brett.
- Ah.

32:19.490 --> 32:24.750
Well, then, Mr. Brett, would you be so kind
as to escort me downstairs to the basement?

32:24.830 --> 32:26.490
Absolutely.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.253
This way. Watch your step.

32:35.608 --> 32:38.893
I wasn't always blind during my time here.

32:41.690 --> 32:44.293
I remember it like the back of my hand.

32:45.690 --> 32:48.093
I'm sorry, you worked here?

32:48.910 --> 32:51.333
For some time, yes.

32:53.420 --> 32:57.479
What did the camera record?
And again, I remind you, Brett...

32:57.559 --> 32:59.573
...please, in detail.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.630
It's just a blur.

33:01.710 --> 33:04.770
I mean, it looked like the shadow
of something moving really fast.

33:04.850 --> 33:08.490
I tried to play it back slowly
and I couldn't make anything out.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.230
I'm going to need you to play it back.

33:11.310 --> 33:13.230
Frame by frame.

33:13.310 --> 33:16.159
And take me through everything
you see on the screen.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.810
It's a couple of frames is all there is.

33:19.890 --> 33:21.950
I mean, it's less than a second.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.570
Can you make anything else out?

33:25.650 --> 33:28.670
You said it looked like a shadow.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.790
Shadow of what?

33:30.870 --> 33:34.533
Honestly, Jacob, I have no idea.

33:35.070 --> 33:36.913
It could be anything.

33:39.990 --> 33:43.310
Are there any marks on the ground?

33:43.390 --> 33:45.346
What kind of marks?

33:45.426 --> 33:47.693
Like footprints.

33:48.530 --> 33:52.470
No, nothing. Am I supposed
to be looking for footprints?

33:52.550 --> 33:54.663
Play it again, please.

34:00.550 --> 34:02.970
Well, maybe if the lighting was better
in there I could see something.

34:03.050 --> 34:05.530
But honestly, I don't know
what the hell I'm looking at.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.710
And I really think we should go
in there and take a look around.

34:07.790 --> 34:09.369
Absolutely not.

34:12.110 --> 34:13.913
You know what, Jacob?

34:14.909 --> 34:18.530
I'm playing along because you
seem like a nice enough guy.

34:19.010 --> 34:23.530
But honestly, I'm getting a little sick and
tired of this Cloak and Dagger bullshit.

34:23.610 --> 34:27.050
Who are you? Why did you take a cab
over here in the middle of the night...

34:27.130 --> 34:30.666
...to come look at some blur which is probably
nothing, but we're not gonna know that...

34:30.746 --> 34:32.790
...because you won't let me go
in there and take a look around.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.050
My, my, my.

34:35.130 --> 34:39.955
Martin did say you are the inquisitive type.
He certainly wasn't wrong.

34:41.290 --> 34:42.813
But...

34:44.170 --> 34:46.639
...I believe he picked
the right man for the job.

34:47.270 --> 34:51.083
You didn't answer my question, Jacob.
Who are you?

34:51.933 --> 34:53.777
Very well.

34:56.375 --> 35:00.410
I work for Martin, Goran...

35:00.490 --> 35:03.880
...and the company
as a consultant, Brett. Satisfied?

35:03.960 --> 35:07.110
Consultant? Well, they did mention
something about that in the interview.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.510
- You could've just said that.
- Yes, I could have, but I didn't.

35:10.590 --> 35:13.430
And before I worked for Martin and Goran...

35:13.510 --> 35:16.610
...I did what you are doing now.

35:16.690 --> 35:19.104
How long did you work for these people?

35:19.670 --> 35:22.895
Until my eyesight was taken from me.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.730
What good is a night watchman who's blind?

35:27.810 --> 35:30.033
Answer me that, Brett.

35:41.710 --> 35:45.530
Should we call Martin and Goran so they can
tell someone at the company what's happened?

35:45.610 --> 35:49.614
There's no need for that.
I shall inform them in the morning.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.223
What are you doing?

35:58.960 --> 36:01.183
Listening, Mr. Anderson.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.473
I'm listening.

36:44.590 --> 36:49.770
- <i>Zara.</i>
- Brett, hi. Um, what's up?

36:49.850 --> 36:53.310
<i>Sorry for calling so late. I was just wondering
if you could help me with something.</i>

36:54.590 --> 36:56.227
I can try, yeah.

36:56.307 --> 36:59.858
What you were telling me today about this
building being so famous around these parts...

36:59.938 --> 37:02.838
...I was trying to find something online but
all I could find were a couple of pretty...

37:02.918 --> 37:04.719
<i>...light articles.</i>

37:05.230 --> 37:09.310
Well, there isn't really much
about things like that online.

37:09.390 --> 37:13.730
The stories mostly came from locals
and people who live nearby, you know.

37:13.810 --> 37:16.216
Yeah, well, I guess that explains it.

37:16.296 --> 37:20.090
<i>Why do you ask?
Are you looking into the murders?</i>

37:20.170 --> 37:21.793
Murders?

37:23.413 --> 37:28.050
Didn't they tell you about the twin girls that
were found dead there when you took the job?

37:28.130 --> 37:30.525
No. No, they didn't.

37:30.605 --> 37:32.453
Oh, geez.

37:32.970 --> 37:34.993
A while back...

37:36.320 --> 37:40.210
...this guy tried to break into the building
in the middle of the night.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.870
<i>When the police were called...</i>

37:43.870 --> 37:46.110
...they checked the trunk of his car...

37:46.190 --> 37:51.362
...and found the bodies of two
eight year old girls, twins, inside it.

37:51.442 --> 37:52.730
Christ.

37:52.810 --> 37:54.970
It actually gets a lot weirder.

37:55.050 --> 37:57.730
Turns out he was their father.

37:57.810 --> 37:59.910
He claimed their mother killed them, but...

37:59.990 --> 38:03.203
...when the police went looking
for her, they couldn't find her.

38:04.690 --> 38:06.950
- What happened to her?
- She disappeared.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.120
Nobody knows where.

38:09.430 --> 38:11.910
Well, did he say anything else?

38:11.990 --> 38:14.810
He wouldn't speak to the cops or anyone else.

38:15.290 --> 38:19.293
Couple of days later and he was
found dead. He hung himself.

38:20.970 --> 38:23.650
Listen, um, if you have some
time tomorrow, could we meet?

38:23.730 --> 38:26.650
I can meet you,
after I finish up at the cafÃ©.

38:26.730 --> 38:28.253
Perfect.

41:11.424 --> 41:15.214
- Mr. Anderson, Brett, you're awake.
- Yeah, Martin, listen, I'm sorry.

41:15.294 --> 41:19.330
My alarm, last night,
I'm not really sure what happened.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.770
It's okay, these things happen.

41:21.853 --> 41:24.550
- You met Jacob last night.
- I did, yeah.

41:24.630 --> 41:28.495
- Called him, correct?
- Was I not supposed to?

41:28.575 --> 41:31.870
No, no, no. You did the right thing,
you did the right thing.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.090
I'm here, I'm making a copy
of the recordings.

41:34.170 --> 41:36.210
I've gotta get it to the company,
they want to review it.

41:36.290 --> 41:38.930
Shouldn't we go in there
and check things out?

41:39.010 --> 41:40.433
No.

41:43.130 --> 41:45.791
Everything I need, right here.

41:45.871 --> 41:50.090
Look, keep doing what you're doing.
And get that alarm clock fixed, yes?

41:50.170 --> 41:52.850
- Sure, yeah.
- All right, goodbye, Brett.

41:52.930 --> 41:54.453
Bye.

42:43.470 --> 42:44.993
Wow!

42:47.110 --> 42:49.333
This place is so cool.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.313
Wait until you see the apartment.

43:01.910 --> 43:05.173
Finally. This is Zahari's place.

43:21.990 --> 43:23.813
She's very pretty.

43:24.847 --> 43:27.350
- Who is she?
- It's my wife.

43:27.430 --> 43:30.470
- My late wife.
- Oh, sorry.

43:30.550 --> 43:33.510
I didn't mean to say...

43:33.590 --> 43:37.013
It's okay. Don't worry.

43:41.750 --> 43:45.690
- You look good in uniform.
- That was taken a very long time ago.

43:45.770 --> 43:48.413
- And who's that?
- That's...

43:49.090 --> 43:51.933
...it's Frank, my old partner.

43:52.013 --> 43:55.590
That actually was the last day
I ever wore that uniform.

43:55.670 --> 43:57.202
Why?

43:57.282 --> 43:59.527
I quit two weeks later.

44:00.250 --> 44:02.890
What did you do? Shoot someone?

44:02.970 --> 44:04.950
It was a kid.

44:05.030 --> 44:07.390
Gang member. He was 15 years old.

44:07.470 --> 44:11.252
He had just murdered Frank in front of me,
and I was gonna be next...

44:11.332 --> 44:14.141
- ...if I didn't do something.
- Jesus, I'm sorry. Jesus.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.310
I'm sorry. Really, I...

44:17.390 --> 44:19.643
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave, you know, I have to...

44:19.723 --> 44:23.170
...because I don't want to put
my foot in my mouth again.

44:23.250 --> 44:25.453
Wait, no, no, no, no.

44:25.810 --> 44:28.653
Don't leave. Stay, stay.

44:29.990 --> 44:31.713
I want you to stay.

46:08.650 --> 46:10.610
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:10.690 --> 46:12.530
I thought you'd gone.

46:13.210 --> 46:15.241
I'm not going anywhere.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.953
Couldn't sleep?

46:21.650 --> 46:23.400
Bad dream.

46:26.290 --> 46:28.333
I can fix that.

47:09.450 --> 47:11.253
What the...

47:48.670 --> 47:51.893
- And you touched nothing?
- No.

47:55.690 --> 47:58.650
- Are you sure?
- Martin, please.

47:58.730 --> 48:01.410
Look, I checked the monitor, I saw
whatever the hell it was that was on it...

48:01.590 --> 48:03.930
...and I called you. In that exact order.

48:04.010 --> 48:06.253
It's fine, fine.

48:07.471 --> 48:09.630
He followed procedures, Martin.

48:09.710 --> 48:11.913
Exactly as requested.

48:12.690 --> 48:16.313
Now, let us examine the footage, shall we?

48:28.290 --> 48:30.970
See right there,
you know what that looks to me?

48:31.050 --> 48:32.843
That looks just like...

48:34.370 --> 48:36.410
Are you certain they are footprints?

48:36.490 --> 48:38.450
I'm looking right at it, Jacob.

48:38.530 --> 48:41.310
And what is it with you
three questioning everything I say?

48:41.390 --> 48:44.013
I... I see them, too.

48:45.390 --> 48:48.833
We're going to have to go inside the hangar.

48:50.410 --> 48:52.213
Take a closer look.

48:54.030 --> 48:57.436
Jake, I need you to wait here, please.

48:57.516 --> 48:59.470
We are going inside?

48:59.550 --> 49:01.973
Now we are talking. Let's go.

49:43.430 --> 49:44.973
Coming or not?

50:06.250 --> 50:10.630
The door operates on a timer. As long
as we have the key, we can get out.

50:10.710 --> 50:13.050
What happens if you don't?

50:13.130 --> 50:14.453
Please.

50:51.650 --> 50:53.560
What do you suppose made these tracks?

50:53.640 --> 50:55.750
I have no idea.

50:55.830 --> 50:57.990
An animal obviously got in here.

50:58.070 --> 51:01.550
Need to look around.
Find how it got in and seal it up.

51:02.330 --> 51:04.130
No. We shouldn't.

51:04.210 --> 51:07.352
I've everything we need. We're leaving. Now!

51:07.432 --> 51:10.010
If we don't seal it up,
we're gonna end up down here...

51:10.090 --> 51:12.389
...every time something sets the system off.

51:17.090 --> 51:19.113
The tracks end here.

51:20.770 --> 51:22.350
Martin?

51:24.315 --> 51:25.903
Seriously?

51:29.090 --> 51:32.810
I've never seen anything like this
before, Martin. We can't just ignore it.

51:32.890 --> 51:36.430
I'm not ignoring it, okay, I just don't
know what to do until he sees them.

51:36.510 --> 51:39.033
- I know that but we have to...
- What the hell is going on?

51:41.610 --> 51:44.633
Nothing. Everything is under control.

51:46.710 --> 51:49.090
- Martin.
- I've gotta make some calls.

51:49.170 --> 51:51.510
- We'll talk later.
- What's going on?

51:51.590 --> 51:55.310
What's up with you two? What's got you
so spooked about being in there?

51:55.390 --> 51:59.395
Tomorrow. Let's talk tomorrow.
I promise, first thing in the morning.

52:12.309 --> 52:14.730
Jesus Christ, Jacob.

52:14.810 --> 52:17.053
I'm... I'm so sorry.

52:17.390 --> 52:20.113
Could you please take me upstairs?

52:21.157 --> 52:24.010
Martin and Goran left in such a hurry, it...

52:24.090 --> 52:26.743
...appears they have abandoned me.

52:31.970 --> 52:33.793
And, Brett...

52:34.630 --> 52:37.033
...do not go into the hangar alone.

53:44.850 --> 53:46.373
Hello?

53:57.830 --> 53:59.353
Hello?

54:19.350 --> 54:20.873
Hello?

54:52.470 --> 54:55.750
- <i>Hello?</i>
- It's me. Can I come in?

54:56.130 --> 54:57.941
I'll be right down.

55:02.090 --> 55:04.520
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

55:05.210 --> 55:06.773
What?

55:07.610 --> 55:09.453
My calls.

55:09.870 --> 55:12.795
- Why haven't you been answering them?
- What are you talking about?

55:12.875 --> 55:16.270
- Did I do something wrong?
- Wait. Zara, no!

55:16.350 --> 55:19.233
What are... what are you
talking about? Calls?

55:19.870 --> 55:22.110
I haven't been doing anything,
I haven't been ignoring you at all.

55:22.190 --> 55:24.030
Just shut up.

56:56.750 --> 56:59.973
What the... hell, Brett!

57:01.630 --> 57:03.616
Are you okay?

57:03.696 --> 57:05.490
I'm sorry.

57:05.570 --> 57:07.393
I'm sorry.

57:08.010 --> 57:10.486
- You don't seem it.
- I'm okay.

57:10.566 --> 57:12.413
My head.

57:12.590 --> 57:14.530
I thought you were...

57:14.610 --> 57:16.034
Anna?

57:16.114 --> 57:17.610
Yeah.

57:19.370 --> 57:20.950
Brett.

57:21.030 --> 57:24.869
Talk to me. Talk to me,
tell me what's going on.

57:30.790 --> 57:32.633
Have you been in therapy?

57:34.470 --> 57:37.647
My friend Alex tried to hook me up
with a shrink, but no.

57:38.950 --> 57:40.773
It's this place.

57:41.330 --> 57:44.962
The visions, the dreams are stronger here.

57:46.990 --> 57:49.243
There's something about this building.

57:50.150 --> 57:51.973
Something bad.

57:52.890 --> 57:54.564
Brett...

57:54.983 --> 57:58.510
...it's not the building.
You have to go to a doctor.

57:58.590 --> 58:01.230
No, these people have been hiding
something from me since I got here.

58:01.310 --> 58:03.560
Something like what, Brett?

58:06.098 --> 58:07.940
It's hard to explain.

58:09.730 --> 58:11.753
It's just there.

58:12.110 --> 58:15.940
It's just gnawing away at the back
of my mind and no matter how hard I try...

58:16.020 --> 58:17.900
...I can't ignore it.

58:20.730 --> 58:22.968
These people are hiding something from me.

58:24.390 --> 58:26.684
I have a bad feeling about this place.

58:40.630 --> 58:44.190
- Hello?
- Brett? It's Jacob Keaton.

58:44.270 --> 58:46.510
I must speak with you immediately.

58:46.590 --> 58:48.688
Jacob, how did you get...

58:48.768 --> 58:51.053
...never mind. I'll be right down.

59:00.270 --> 59:03.153
- How did you get here?
- I drove.

59:04.530 --> 59:09.193
I'm blind, Brett.
I'm not in a coma. I took a taxi.

59:10.930 --> 59:14.448
- It's four in the morning, Jacob.
- We are running out of time.

59:14.528 --> 59:16.372
I think it has started.

59:17.370 --> 59:19.173
What's started?

59:21.270 --> 59:23.093
Jacob, what's started?

59:30.390 --> 59:34.930
Oh, hi. I better put some clothes on.

59:35.010 --> 59:37.190
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

59:37.270 --> 59:39.093
And you are?

59:40.963 --> 59:44.447
- Zara.
- EnchantÃ©, Miss Zara.

59:45.700 --> 59:48.340
Jacob Keaton, at your disposal.

59:48.420 --> 59:49.930
Pleasure.

59:50.010 --> 59:52.013
I'm just gonna... okay.

59:56.850 --> 59:58.937
- What's this about?
- Oh.

59:59.017 --> 01:00:02.893
I shall require you to
accompany me to the penthouse.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.790
There's no one there, Jacob.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.210
In fact, we are the only people
in the entire building.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.350
I checked all the apartments that Martin
and Goran said people were living in...

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.708
...and there was no one there.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.050
They're empty.

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:20.150
Why are they empty, Jacob?

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.780
What is it that got Martin and Goran
so spooked out earlier today?

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.490
If you come with me,
I shall explain everything.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.560
Where are you going?

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.210
- Open it.
- I don't have a key.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.113
Yes, you do.

01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:58.973
This way.

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:34.035
There's nothing to be afraid of here.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.563
He is dying.

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:57.210
Jacob, who is this man?

01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:58.853
Zahari.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.865
His name is Zahari.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.504
The architect?

01:02:05.584 --> 01:02:10.225
- If this is Zahari that would make him like...
- 150 years old, give or take.

01:02:10.305 --> 01:02:13.950
You don't really expect me to believe that this
is the guy that built the building, do you?

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:17.552
- Come on, Jacob!
- Young man...

01:02:17.632 --> 01:02:20.791
...I am going to need you to help me stop...

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.250
...what I fear is about to occur here.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:27.050
How can I help you stop something when I
don't even understand what you're saying?

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.569
Do you believe in the afterlife, Brett?

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.290
Do I believe in the afterlife?
What kind a question is that?

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:36.340
No, I don't.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.450
This place...

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.570
...this building...

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.909
...it occupies a space...

01:02:43.989 --> 01:02:46.340
...directly over...

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.242
...one of the seven gates...

01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:51.503
...each one, each gate...

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.890
...a kind of, how shall I say...

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:58.040
...doorway to the other side.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.985
Other side?

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:02.825
The Nightworld.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:05.605
Land of the dead.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.605
Okay, I'm out of here.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.559
You must listen. The remaining six gates...

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:15.970
...are scattered throughout the world...

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.370
...the location only known
to the guardian tasked...

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:23.070
...with protecting his gate, his doorway.

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.145
Now, if...

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:28.283
...God forbid, the dead...

01:03:28.363 --> 01:03:31.385
...they somehow found a gateway...

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.395
...on the other side...

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.990
...then they could move freely
between this world...

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.510
...and their Nightworld.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.929
Zahari and the others, they feared that...

01:03:42.009 --> 01:03:45.081
...that something,
something else, something...

01:03:45.161 --> 01:03:47.730
...from before the time of man...

01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:50.665
...would find its way through
and into our world...

01:03:50.745 --> 01:03:55.027
...so they sought to prevent
that from ever happening.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.410
You don't actually believe this crap, do you?

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:04.068
- Do you know what you sound like?
- This man, this good man...

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:07.945
...he was tasked
with responsible for creating...

01:04:08.025 --> 01:04:10.150
...designing, crafting the seals...

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.738
...which prevent anything from crossing over.

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:17.070
He agreed to remain here,
in this very building...

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.470
...to serve as the last guardian...

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:24.670
...the keeper of the seventh
and final gateway.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.170
If he is the guardian of the last seal,
who are the others?

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.590
Ah, this I do not know. But...

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:35.845
...each of the seven guardians
answers to a man named Pritchard...

01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:37.970
...Isaac Pritchard.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.090
He is the only one who knows the location...

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.265
...of all the gateways.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:47.250
This man, how can he still be here?

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:51.543
I mean, how can he
still be alive after all this time?

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.199
Zahari...

01:04:54.861 --> 01:04:56.240
...he was an alchemist.

01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:59.303
He was able to prolong his life...

01:04:59.383 --> 01:05:01.980
...by unnatural means.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.365
Maria.

01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.525
- Who?
- The cleaner.

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:17.044
She was walking around with a cart full
of medical supplies the day I got here.

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:24.010
- What is she doing with him?
- That is no concern of ours, Brett.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:26.594
What you must understand is this...

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.790
...Zahari is dying.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:32.910
Which means that the gateway
beneath us is vulnerable.

01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:36.530
What you saw on the cameras
the other day, I...

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:40.866
...I suspect it most likely means
that someone or something...

01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:44.127
...is trying to force its way
through and into our world.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:47.110
They know the gateway is exposed.

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:50.410
So we must act now to stop them...

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:53.210
...or it will be breached
and we will never be able to.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:55.535
Stop who?

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.190
Who do we need to stop?

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.810
I must get to the basement now!

01:06:01.868 --> 01:06:04.090
I cannot do this on my own.

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:06.190
We're not going anywhere near the basement.

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:08.130
You must listen to me!

01:06:08.929 --> 01:06:10.910
I'm through listening to you, Jacob.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:14.270
I'm gonna go call Martin and Goran
and then I'm taking you home.

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:18.407
If you do not do as I ask,
everything you know...

01:06:18.487 --> 01:06:21.170
...everything you love will end.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:30.810
No one's picking up.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:42.183
Rats always leave the sinking ship.

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:45.314
Are you going back to Varna?

01:06:45.394 --> 01:06:48.542
No. I don't know.
Can we not do this right now?

01:06:48.622 --> 01:06:51.919
I just think we should get out of this
place until I figure out what to do.

01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.614
- Where did he go?
- Stubborn old bastard.

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:03.030
<i>He has a key.</i>

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.645
What the hell is that?

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:24.919
Tell me. What do you see in there?

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:27.705
Footprints.

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:30.205
Hundreds of them.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.125
Alex? What the hell is he doing here?

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.925
Do not let him go in there.

01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:53.270
- Alex? What are you doing here?
- Good to see you, too, buddy.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.256
- How did you get through the front gate?
- That gate was opened and I just...

01:07:57.336 --> 01:08:00.350
...kind of walked in.
And where the fuck have you been?

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.045
I've been here. Come in.
I need to get something.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.450
If you've been here this whole time,
then how come I haven't been able...

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:11.170
...to get a hold of you for five days?

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.490
- You're screwing with me, right?
- Yeah, I'm screwing with you.

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:20.210
Come on, man, you know me. You think I'd
hop on a bus and take a six hour road trip...

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:23.330
- ...to Sofia just to screw with you?
- Yeah, but you and I talked yesterday.

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.305
Oh, no, we didn't.

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:29.425
Jacob will know what's going on.
Just come with me.

01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:33.104
What's going on, man? You're freaking me out.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:36.630
Okay, you want me to go just say so.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:39.812
Brett? Hey, what's the gun for, man?

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:53.069
You want to tell me what's been
going on these past five days?

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.361
It hasn't been five days.

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.149
I need to talk to Jacob first.

01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:01.170
Wait, who's this Jacob guy
you keep bringing up?

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:06.725
Hey! Are you sure this thing's safe?

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.662
- What's happening?
- Zara...

01:09:12.743 --> 01:09:15.430
...when you came over earlier you said
I haven't been answering my phone.

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:17.950
- Yes, why?
- Why did you ask me that?

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.388
When was the last time
we saw each other or spoke?

01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:24.069
Four, five days ago. I thought you
were blowing me off, that's why I came.

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:26.830
- I don't know.
- Jacob, what the hell is going on?

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:29.870
How can I lose five days?
How is that possible?

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.930
I remember talking to Alex yesterday.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:35.710
And then I remember seeing you
and Martin and Goran. And now this.

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:39.395
How could I lose five days?
How could anyone lose five days?

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.270
In the Nightworld, the concept of time...

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:46.336
...it has no place, no meaning.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.250
- It simply ceases to...
- What's he talking about?

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:53.830
- What is it?
- What was that?

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:57.414
- I can't make anything out.
- We must go inside. Now!

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.345
Inside where?

01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:04.545
My friend, you take this.

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.813
You'll need it in there.

01:10:06.893 --> 01:10:09.925
- What is it?
- It works in there.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.985
I'm good.

01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:17.450
What do we do when we get in there?
How do we stop this?

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:21.412
We must seal the breach before
it becomes completely unstable...

01:10:21.492 --> 01:10:23.840
- ...and it's too late.
- Too late for what?

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.995
How do we seal it?

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:31.559
I possess the key.

01:10:31.639 --> 01:10:33.445
I can guide you.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.630
Okay. Look, you two stay here.

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.830
Someone please tell me
what the fuck's going on here!

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:43.370
Just... please. Stay here with her!

01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:51.590
- Now what?
- Look, you two just stay here!

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:54.530
- Jacob, come on, let's go.
- No, man, I'm going with you.

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.427
I'm going, too.

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.805
Fine.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.465
We'll all go, but we stick together. Get him.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.030
Jacob, these symbols, what do they mean?

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.370
They are the seals.

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.870
Glyphs. The protection symbols.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.419
- Protection from what?
- The dead.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:48.190
Only those from the land of the living...

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.945
...can unlock this door from both sides.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:26.870
Brett!

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:30.230
It's okay. It's supposed
to do that, we're not locked in.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.336
Jacob, what are we looking for down here?

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:37.178
We need to go further into this hangar.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.175
How much further?

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:43.125
Further.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.282
This place is huge.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.224
How are we supposed to find anything in here?

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:23.259
Jacob, I need you to be straight
with me about something.

01:13:23.339 --> 01:13:26.023
There was an incident
that happened a few years back.

01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:30.150
With the twin sisters. You were
working here when that happened, right?

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.440
Yes, I remember.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.325
So why this place? Why here?

01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:43.608
The father of those children,
he believed absolutely...

01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:45.610
...that this building...

01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:48.810
...held the power to bring them back.

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:51.030
Bring them back from where?

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:52.965
The dead, of course.

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.185
I see.

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.068
Sir...

01:14:00.482 --> 01:14:03.632
...you're fucking crazy.
But you know that, don't you?

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:35.638
I see you.

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:42.090
- What's wrong?
- Yeah, what's wrong, Jacob?

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:45.190
- The guardian.
- Zahari?

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:47.280
He is gone.

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:56.370
- Go, go, go, go. They're coming.
- Who's coming?

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:00.170
- The dead, you idiot!
- Of course, who else could it be?

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.630
Tell me you're not buying this bullshit.

01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:05.990
Look around, there's nobody here.
It's just me, you, her...

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.450
...and a creepy blind guy
who's missing a few marbles.

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:14.245
What?

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.965
Do you hear that?

01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:22.210
- I don't hear a thing.
- What is it? Brett?

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:24.156
Brett, wait!

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.629
Brett, wait!

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:41.925
Brett.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.258
Brett, where are you?

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.545
Brett, where are you?

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.405
I can't see him.

01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:00.281
Hello?

01:16:10.831 --> 01:16:12.410
Hello?

01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:17.828
Hello? How did you get down here?

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:31.334
- Brett?
- Oh, my God! No!

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.928
No! You're not real!

01:16:37.008 --> 01:16:39.430
You're not real, you can't be real! No!

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:41.550
It's me.

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:44.250
- Your Anna.
- What?

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.615
No, it's impossible.

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:49.668
Where are you!

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:54.367
Brett, where are you?

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.245
I can't see him.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:02.390
Hey. This is all your fault, man!

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:06.310
You put all this shit in his head
and now my friend is losing his damn mind.

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:10.270
He said he heard someone.
We need to go after him.

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:14.005
What we need is to get out of here. So hurry!

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:19.925
Anna?

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.553
Anna? Here, come with me.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:29.559
Come on, come on.

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.165
Come on.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.795
Brett.

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.370
Fuck me.

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:12.189
Come, come!

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.890
Wait. Wait.

01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:26.385
I... I dropped the key.

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.890
Shit!

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:40.630
I got it!

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:52.915
Zara!

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:06.710
Brett!

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:08.385
Zara!

01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:12.030
- Do you have the key?
- Here.

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.929
Where are the others?

01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:35.195
Oh, my God!

01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:39.590
What happened?

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:46.145
Brett.

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:47.998
Is that...

01:19:49.332 --> 01:19:50.899
Yes.

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:56.610
How is this... how is this possible?
How is this possible?

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:58.565
I don't know.

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:01.174
She found her way back.

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:03.530
Just hold on.

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.085
Anna?

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:40.365
I'm scared.

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:45.665
How?

01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:48.895
How could you be...

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:52.939
- ...here?
- None of that matters anymore.

01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:56.813
I made my way back to you.

01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:59.740
I'm here.

01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:02.725
I'm here now.

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:05.750
I'm here now.

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:07.430
Brett.

01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:10.750
- We need to get out of this place.
- But I can't.

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:13.717
Brett. This is not Anna.

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:16.770
What are you talking about?

01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:21.230
Anna's dead, Brett. She is dead.

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.249
No, she's not.

01:21:23.329 --> 01:21:26.650
She's right here. She came back
for me, Zara, can't you see that?

01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:28.350
Brett, please!

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:31.265
I need you to do something for me, baby.

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:35.331
I need you to open that door for me.

01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:38.085
- No, don't.
- To free me.

01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:41.710
- To free my soul.
- Brett, don't. Don't!

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.820
I can't, I can't do that, Anna.
Those things... those things are going...

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:49.104
Yes, you can. You can. That's the only way.

01:21:49.184 --> 01:21:51.590
We can be together forever.

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:54.650
You have to open the door for me, baby.

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:56.490
Why?

01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:58.450
Why did you leave me?

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.010
Why did you give up on us, Anna?

01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:03.950
I did it for us, baby.

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:07.665
- I don't understand.
- I did it 'cause...

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.485
...I wanted to be together forever.

01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:14.325
I never left.

01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:16.879
I've always been with you.

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.805
I brought you here.

01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:24.910
Everything you've ever done
since I've been gone...

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:27.411
...has been leading up to this moment.

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:30.210
Don't you feel it?

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:33.367
- Brett, please.
- You know it's true, don't you?

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:35.525
I...

01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:37.830
I...

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:40.965
Brett. Where is the key?

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.849
Where is the key?

01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:49.775
Now, open the door.

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:55.765
Open the door.

01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:58.870
Open the door!

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.545
Brett!

01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:04.535
Stay away from him, bitch!

01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.896
Give me the key, bitch!

01:23:23.976 --> 01:23:25.865
Fuck you!

01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:51.805
You're never gonna hurt me.

01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:54.630
It's me.

01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:56.605
Your Anna.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.685
You love me.

01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:04.565
Not her.

01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:17.205
Come on. Come on, here.

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.370
- Brett.
- What?

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:38.530
It's too late.

01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:39.741
The door...

01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:42.272
- What? What?
- ...is open.

01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:04.610
Hey. Hey! Look at me!

01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:06.424
- You stay with me, Zara!
- I'm sorry.

01:25:06.504 --> 01:25:10.601
No! It's okay. It doesn't matter, okay?
You stay with me. Hey, look at me!

01:25:10.681 --> 01:25:13.930
Zara, stay with me, okay?
Look at me, right here, all right?

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:15.458
- All right? Okay, cool.
- Okay. I'm here.

01:25:15.538 --> 01:25:18.170
We're gonna be there, all right?
We're gonna be there, all right?

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.830
- Yeah. Yes.
- It's gonna be good.

01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:22.230
- Okay.
- Okay. Look at me. Right?

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:24.125
Keep looking at me.

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.870
Okay, okay, good, we're getting it.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.765
Be careful.

01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:45.150
Okay. Come on, come on.

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:47.890
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:49.495
Yeah.

01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:53.038
Zara!

01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.870
Zara, come on. Zara! Look at me. Look at me!

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:04.045
No, no.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.245
Brett.

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:09.450
Come on.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:10.925
No.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.845
Jacob?

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.930
I'm sorry, old friend.

01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:22.575
Who are you?

01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:26.200
My name is Isaac Pritchard, Mr. Anderson.

01:27:26.670 --> 01:27:29.615
Did anyone else make it out
of the building with you?

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:33.006
Is there anyone else alive inside?

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.595
Pritchard?

01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:41.053
Mr. Anderson, are you the only one
who made it out of the building?

01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:45.390
They're dead.

01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.385
They're all dead.

01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:52.530
Okay. I need you to go
with my people, Mr. Anderson.

01:27:52.831 --> 01:27:55.890
Everything will be fine. I promise you.

01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.769
I'll explain everything to you on the way.

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:03.454
- Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere safe.

01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:05.390
You've done your part now, Mr. Anderson.

01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:08.030
We're going to take care
of everything now from here.

01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.730
Please, just go with my men.

01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:12.685
They'll see to you.
