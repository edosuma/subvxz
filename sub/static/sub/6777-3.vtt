01:49.070 --> 01:53.837
* WHERE DO I GO,

01:53.940 --> 01:57.068

DUH, DUH, DUH *

01:57.180 --> 02:01.844

02:18.600 --> 02:20.329
SLOW DOWN, BITCH.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.089
HEY, WE JUST WANT
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.235
YOU KNOW YOU WANT
SOME OF THIS.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.503
BITCH, YOU KNOW
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.248
HEY, CALLIE !

02:29.350 --> 02:31.602
HEY, CALLIE,

02:31.710 --> 02:32.642
GODDAMNIT, ZACH !

02:32.750 --> 02:33.739
( tires screeching,
horn honking )

02:33.850 --> 02:35.249
OH, SHIT, CALLIE !

02:35.350 --> 02:39.616
CALLIE, CALLIE !

02:39.720 --> 02:46.489
* SAY IT'S ONLY A PAPER MOON
SAILING OVER A CARDBOARD SEA *

02:46.600 --> 02:50.229
* BUT IT WOULDN'T
BE MAKE BELIEVE *

02:50.330 --> 02:54.061
* IF YOU BELIEVED IN ME

02:54.170 --> 02:58.266
* YES, IT'S ONLY
A CANVAS SKY *

02:58.370 --> 03:03.444
* HANGING OVER
A MUSLIN TREE *

03:03.550 --> 03:10.649
* BUT IT WOULDN'T BE MAKE
BELIEVE IF YOU BELIEVED IN ME *

03:10.750 --> 03:13.856
PERFECT.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.827
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I WANT IT
TO SOUND IN PASADENA.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.522
UCH, IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.

03:18.630 --> 03:22.464
BARITONES, SOMEONE AMONG YOU
WAS SINGING A "B" FLAT,

03:22.570 --> 03:24.526
OF ALL
INAPPROPRIATE NOTES.

03:24.630 --> 03:25.767
AND UM,

03:25.870 --> 03:28.668
THERE WAS A CERTAIN TENOR
WHO WAS SHARP ON THE "G".

03:28.770 --> 03:30.408
A LOT.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.035
I CAN ONLY PRAY TO JESUS YOU
KNOW WHO YOU ARE, EVAN.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.199
IT WAS THE EMOTION,
DENNIS.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.574
THAT'S TOUCHING,
BUT NO ONE CARES.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.318
OKAY,

03:39.420 --> 03:42.139
SADLY FOR OUR AUDIENCES
WHO HAVE PAID $25 TO HEAR US,

03:42.250 --> 03:45.219
WE DO NOT HAVE TIME
TO WORK ON THAT TONIGHT.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.185
BUT PLEASE,
AND I AM BEGGING YOU

03:47.290 --> 03:49.429
FROM A PLACE OF
RAW DESPERATION,

03:49.530 --> 03:52.419
LEARN YOUR PARTS
THIS WEEKEND.

03:52.530 --> 03:55.158
FOR THEM,
IF NOT FOR ME.

03:55.260 --> 03:58.559
DISMISSED.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.665
DAVID, HEY.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.431
ARE YOU GOING TO EVAN'S
OPEN HOUSE TOMORROW ?

04:04.540 --> 04:06.735
NO, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I CAN'T--

04:06.840 --> 04:08.398
I PROMISE IT WON'T BE ONE OF
THOSE SLOPPY SCENES WHERE

04:08.510 --> 04:10.444
EVERYBODY ENDS UP
NAKED IN THE POOL,

04:10.550 --> 04:12.142
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE IMAGE OF

04:12.250 --> 04:13.945
THEIR SOGGY PUBIC HAIR IN YOUR
MIND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.039
( laughing )

04:15.150 --> 04:16.242
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

04:16.350 --> 04:18.489
YEAH, IT'S JUST,
I'M GOING AWAY.

04:18.590 --> 04:19.579
OH.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.419
WELL, I'M SURE
HE'LL HAVE ANOTHER.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.819
I HOPE SO, BECAUSE
I'D REALLY LOVE TO GO.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.079
OKAY.

04:26.190 --> 04:28.329
WELL, SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.863
( moaning )

04:34.970 --> 04:36.232
SHH !

04:36.340 --> 04:38.365
SHUT UP.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.973
MY MOM'S A REALLY
LIGHT SLEEPER.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.638
SORRY.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.274
THAT WAS...

04:44.380 --> 04:46.814
IT WAS A REALLY
GREAT ONE.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.978
IT WAS ?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.139
MMM.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.786
HOW WERE YOURS ?

04:51.890 --> 04:53.050
GOOD.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.650
JUST GOOD ?

04:54.760 --> 04:56.011
BOTH ?

04:56.120 --> 04:58.782
IT WAS JUST ONE.

04:58.890 --> 05:01.427
BUT IT WAS GOOD.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.093
IT WAS VERY GOOD.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.499
I THINK
WE CAN DO BE'I'I'ER.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.475
ARE YOU TIRED ?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.571
IT'S REALLY LATE...

05:19.680 --> 05:23.081
I WAS THINKING
I'D SLEEP OVER.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.919
I DON'T KNOW...

05:25.020 --> 05:26.351
I GUESS.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.882
IS THAT COOL ?

05:27.990 --> 05:30.686
YEAH, FUCK IT.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.951
DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM,
THOUGH.

05:33.060 --> 05:36.791
'CAUSE MY MOM GETS UP TO PEE
LIKE 500 TIMES A NIGHT.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.205
NOW I HAVE TO PEE.

05:46.310 --> 05:48.130
JUST GO
OUT THE WINDOW.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.800
THAT'S WHAT NATE USED
TO DO WHEN THIS WAS HIS ROOM.

05:50.910 --> 05:56.485
JUST TRY TO AVOID THE AVOCADO
TREE 'CAUSE WE EAT THOSE.

05:58.420 --> 06:01.810
JUST DO IT.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.128
ALMOST THERE !

06:10.230 --> 06:11.868
MY ASS IS
KILLING ME.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.562
SCIATICA ?

06:13.670 --> 06:14.864
NO!

06:14.970 --> 06:18.064
IT'S USED TO BEING NESTLED
IN A NICE SOFI' CAR SEAT

06:18.170 --> 06:20.138
FOR THIS TRIP.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.128
( spitting )

06:22.240 --> 06:24.379
I JUST LOVE
THE FRESH AIR.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.210
IT SMELLS A LOT
LIKE DOG CRAP.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.072
WE HAD A LITTLE DOG,
YEARS AGO.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.614
A TERRIER WE GOT FOR NATE
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH DAVID

06:31.720 --> 06:34.154
SO, HE WOULDN'T BE JEALOUS
OF THE BABY, YOU KNOW ?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.488
YIPPIE,
HE CALLED HIM.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.455
BUT HE HAD SOME KIND
OF A RARE HEART DEFECT,

06:37.560 --> 06:40.552
SO, THE DAY WE CAME
HOME WITH DAVID,

06:40.660 --> 06:43.925
YIPPIE CRAWLED UNDER
NATE'S LITTLE BED AND DIED.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.698
THAT'S HOW MY LAST
HUSBAND WENT.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.461
HEART DEFECT.

06:49.570 --> 06:52.471
JOGGED FIVE MILES
EVERY MORNING,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.275
THEN ONE DAY ?

06:54.380 --> 06:55.733
POOF.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.239
46 YEARS OLD.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.578
OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.773
IT WAS BETTER THAN
WITH MY FIRST HUSBAND.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.814
MELANOMA AT 25.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.185
AND IT WAS IN AND OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL FOR 10 YEARS.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.110
CHEMO THREE TIMES.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.983
THAT WAS HARD.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.388
I REALLY LOVED HIM.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.458
I'M SO SORRY.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.799
WHEN DID
YOU REMARRY ?

07:19.900 --> 07:24.064
WELL, THERE WAS ONE
IN BETWEEN THE TWO THAT DIED.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.263
HE WAS JUST A DOG.

07:26.370 --> 07:29.407
HE TRIED TO SLEEP WITH EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.909
HE'LL PROBABLY
LIVE TO BE 100

07:31.010 --> 07:33.274
AND SCREWING OTHER PEOPLE'S
WIVES THE WHOLE TIME.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.177
SONOFABITCH.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.145
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.411
IT'S OKAY,
IT IS FUNNY.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.409
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
OF MYSELF AS LUCKY

07:42.530 --> 07:44.623
HAVING ONLY BURIED
ONE HUSBAND BEFORE.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.721
LUCKY, UNLUCKY,
I DON'T KNOW.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.458
I'M UNLUCKY I RAN
THROUGH THREE HUSBANDS.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.494
I'M LUCKY I GOT TO RETIRE
EARLY OFF THE INSURANCE.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.160
I'M UNLUCKY MY SON
SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE.

07:55.270 --> 07:58.068
I'M LUCKY I NEVER HAD
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.968
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT
WORKS OUT FAIR IN THE END.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.604
I'M SURE IT DOESN'T.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.008
I STILL HAVE TO HAUL MY OWN ASS
OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.611
I WENT TO THIS...

08:06.720 --> 08:10.486
I TOOK A KIND OF A SEMINAR
THAT WAS ABOUT THAT--

08:10.590 --> 08:12.148
OH, EST ?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.717
LIFESPRING ?
THE PLAN ?

08:13.820 --> 08:14.787
THE PLAN.

08:14.890 --> 08:16.357
MY DAUGHTER WAS INTO
THAT FOR YEARS.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.189
SHE WAS
A GROUP LEADER,

08:18.290 --> 08:20.850
SHE INSPIRED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.919
NOW, SHE'S HOARDING FIREARMS
IN A COMPOUND IN MONTANA.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.292
NO!

08:26.400 --> 08:29.836
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY
SUSCEPTIBLE TO GROUP MENTALITY.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.478
MAYBE I COULD HAVE GIVEN HER
A STRONGER SENSE OF SELF,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.174
BUT YOU KNOW,
I DID MY BEST.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.872
SOME THINGS ARE
JUST GENETIC.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.618
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO ?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.312
CAN'T YOU GET SOME KIND
OF DE-PROGRAMMER TO GO IN

08:41.420 --> 08:42.819
AND RESCUE HER ?

08:42.920 --> 08:44.478
YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHE'S AN ADULT.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.717
I MEAN
IT'S HER LIFE NOW.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.482
MAYBE I SCREWED HER UP,
MAYBE I DIDN'T.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.729
MY SON
TURNED OUT FINE.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.321
HOW ARE YOUR KIDS ?

08:54.430 --> 08:56.250
FINE...

08:56.360 --> 08:58.191
I THINK.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.939
I HAVE TO GO.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.304
I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW IN TWO
HOURS AND I HAVE TO SHOWER !

09:04.410 --> 09:05.707
WHAT KIND OF JOB ?

09:05.810 --> 09:07.402
AS AN ACCOUNTANT FOR
A CHAIN OF DRY CLEANERS ?

09:07.510 --> 09:09.205
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
GOOD WITH BOOKS.

09:09.310 --> 09:10.800
SOUNDS FUN.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.138
OH, I KNOW.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.410
BUT, I NEED
THE EXTRA INCOME

09:13.520 --> 09:14.817
AND IT'S GOOD FOR ME
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.239
YOU'RE OUT OF
THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

09:16.350 --> 09:17.681
THAT'S TRUE.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.417
I THINK IT WOULD BE BE'I'I'ER
TO GO TO BREAKFAST.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.250
THE FRENCH MARKETPLACE
HAS A $3.99 SPECIAL.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.158
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.825
SHE WAS RUNNING
FROM A GROUP OF

09:28.930 --> 09:31.467
BOYS WHO WERE
WHISTLING...

09:31.570 --> 09:34.733
AND SHE GOT SCARED THAT
THEY WERE FOLLOWING HER

09:34.840 --> 09:38.037
INTO A PARKING
STRUCTURE.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.176
SO...

09:40.280 --> 09:43.670
SHE RAN INTO THE STREET.

09:43.780 --> 09:47.318
THE CAR WAS SPEEDING,
IT WAS DARK...

09:47.420 --> 09:50.844
I'M SO SORRY.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.680
DID THEY
CATCH THE BOYS ?

09:53.790 --> 09:56.281
THEY WERE THE ONES
WHO CALLED THE AMBULANCE.

09:56.390 --> 10:01.726
THEY WERE
HER FRIENDS.

10:01.830 --> 10:05.425
I'M SORRY, I DON'T
QUITE UNDERSTAND... ?

10:05.530 --> 10:07.339
THEY WERE JUST
PLAYING AROUND.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.069
THEY WERE ALL
IN A STATE OF SHOCK

10:11.170 --> 10:15.436
THAT A WOMAN COULD BE
TERRIFIED BY A GROUP OF MEN

10:15.540 --> 10:18.247
CHASING HER
AT NIGHT.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.146
OF COURSE YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S YOUR FRIENDS.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.649
WHEN THEY SAW HER RUNNING,
THEY TRIED CALLING HER NAME.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.719
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.669
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.215
CAROL ?

10:55.320 --> 10:57.641
I'M HERE
WITH YOUR CAKE.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.785
THAN KS.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.448
JUST PASS IT
IN HERE.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.654
IN WHERE ?

11:05.530 --> 11:07.998
ARE YOU OKAY ?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.796
I JUST NEED TO HAVE MY CAKE
IN A SAFE WHITE PLACE TODAY.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.891
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN ?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.163
I HAD A VERY UPSE'ITING
CONFERENCE CALL

11:16.270 --> 11:17.931
WITH KATE HUDSON'S PEOPLE.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.166
OH.

11:19.270 --> 11:21.738
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY DEMEANING
TO HAVE THESE LITI'LE GIRLS

11:21.840 --> 11:23.569
IN THEIR $800 SHOES,

11:23.680 --> 11:25.500
WHO GREW UP WATCHING
MUSIC VIDEOS TELLING ME

11:25.610 --> 11:27.544
WHAT "A MOVIE" IS.

11:27.650 --> 11:29.709
I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR 20 YEARS.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.583
I'VE WORKED WITH STALLONE,
ELLEN BARKIN,

11:31.690 --> 11:33.658
MELANIE FUCKING GRIFFITH.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.251
MY WORK IS
EVERYTHING TO ME !

11:36.360 --> 11:37.918
I HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD A LIFE !

11:38.030 --> 11:40.590
I'M ON THE FUCKING SET, DEALING
WITH EVERYONE ELSE'S CRISIS,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.452
ROPING IN THE DIRECTOR,
FIRING THE WRITER,

11:42.560 --> 11:43.891
WRANGLING THE STAR.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.729
AND WHO TAKES
CARE OF ME ?

11:45.830 --> 11:49.664
WHO EVEN WANTS
TO TAKE CARE OF ME ?

11:49.770 --> 11:55.128
THAT SOUNDS
REALLY HARD.

11:56.880 --> 12:00.941
UCH, IT'S SO BRIGHT
OUT HERE.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.645
CAREFUL, LISA !

12:03.750 --> 12:04.944

12:15.730 --> 12:17.163

12:17.270 --> 12:18.521
LISA, HONEY ?

12:18.630 --> 12:20.996
YOUR HUSBAND'S CAR WAS IN THE
DRIVEWAY AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.568
I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS
HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM THIS IS.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.001
HE CAME HOME SO LATE.

12:25.110 --> 12:26.463
I'M SURE HE THOUGHT YOU
WOULDN'T NEED TO GET OUT.

12:26.570 --> 12:27.935
WHAT IF I DID,
THOUGH ?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.371
YOU WOULD
HAVE CALLED US.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.277
NO, I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU
IN YOUR PRIVATE TIME...

12:31.380 --> 12:32.677
AT HOME, NO !

12:32.780 --> 12:34.042
I'LL TELL HIM.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.880
IT'S NOT THAT CHALLENGING
TO FIND STREET PARKING !

12:37.850 --> 12:39.579
IS IT A SNAKE ?

12:39.690 --> 12:41.157
OR SOME KIND OF
TROPICAL VINE ?

12:41.260 --> 12:44.024
IT'S KIND OF A COMBINATION
OF MAORI TA MOKO

12:44.130 --> 12:47.759
AND ALSO JAPANESE KANJI FOR,
LIKE, INNER WISDOM, I THINK.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.498
THIS, RIGHT HERE.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.090
OH, MY.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.667
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO AN INTERVIEW.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.193
I DECIDED THAT JOB
WASN'T REALLY ME.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.836
OH.

12:56.940 --> 13:00.728
WELL, THERE'S EGGS
AND BACON IN THE FRIDGE.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.877
AND I THINK THERE ARE
STILL SOME FROZEN WAFFLES.

13:03.980 --> 13:06.574
YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN THERE
SINCE LIKE, 1992.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.568
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
THEY'RE PERFECT LY FRESH.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.489
I'LL TAKE
A WAFFLE !

13:22.760 --> 13:24.421
LET'S SAY...

13:24.530 --> 13:26.566
YOU'VE JUST MET
SOMEONE, OH,

13:26.670 --> 13:28.797
A MONTH OR SO AGO,

13:28.900 --> 13:31.232
AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS
OF EXCHANGING MESSAGES,

13:31.340 --> 13:34.070
YOU FINALLY GET TOGETHER
FOR A NICE ACTIVITY,

13:34.180 --> 13:35.909
LIKE A HIKE,
FOR EXAMPLE,

13:36.010 --> 13:37.238
AND YOU HAVE
A DELIGHTFUL TIME

13:37.350 --> 13:39.375
AND YOU THINK
THE OTHER PERSON DID TOO.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.744
HOW LONG WOULD YOU WAIT
TO CALL THE PERSON

13:41.850 --> 13:43.340
TO SET UP
ANOTHER DATE ?

13:43.450 --> 13:45.042
WHO CALLED
WHO FIRST ?

13:45.150 --> 13:46.879
IS THIS
ANOTHER BOYFRIEND ?

13:46.990 --> 13:48.116
NO, IT IS NOT.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.529
BUT I DON'T
APPRECIATE THAT TONE.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.321
I DID ORIGINALLY.

13:53.430 --> 13:54.897
WAIT.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.353
IT'S HIS TURN.

13:56.460 --> 14:02.160
IT'S REALLY BAD TO BE,
LIKE, BEGGING FOR IT.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.202
HM.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.904
THE WAFFLES ARE
IN THE TOASTER.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.501
NICE TO MEET YOU,
DEAR.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.848
YOU DON'T WANT
TO EAT THOSE.

14:16.950 --> 14:19.009
I CAN MAKE YOU
SOME TOAST.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.953
THAT'S OKAY, I'LL GRAB
SOMETHING ON THE WAY TO WORK.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.550
OH, DO YOU WANT TO SEE
"A CLOCKWORK ORANGE"

14:23.660 --> 14:24.922
TOMORROW NIGHT ?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.327
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT,
AND RUSSELL SAYS

14:26.430 --> 14:29.297
IT'S LIKE MANDATORY VIEWING
FOR ALL HUMANS.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.493
I CAN'T, WE'RE PLAYING
AT THE SMELL.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.897
REALLY ?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.160
WHAT TIME
DO YOU GUYS GO ON ?

14:34.270 --> 14:36.488
WE PROBABLY WON'T
START UNTIL LIKE 11...

14:36.600 --> 14:38.261
OKAY.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.930
BUT IT MAY NOT BE
THAT FUN FOR YOU,

14:41.040 --> 14:43.440
I HAVE THESE OTHER FRIENDS
COMING WHO YOU DON'T KNOW...

14:43.550 --> 14:44.847
SO, CAN'T I MEET THEM ?

14:44.950 --> 14:47.418
I DON'T THINK YOU
REALLY WANT TO.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.318
OH, OKAY.

14:50.420 --> 14:54.754
BUT FRIDAY'S AWESOME, IF YOU
WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE THEN.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.986
NO, IT'S ONLY TOMORROW.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.978
FRIDAY'S
"EYES WIDE SHUT".

14:58.090 --> 14:59.387
DO YOU WANT
TO SEE THAT ?

14:59.490 --> 15:01.321
I DID.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.591
OKAY, SO...

15:03.700 --> 15:07.591
WE'LL DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.375
"PRIVATE BALCONIES,
INVIGORATING POOLS AND JACUZZI,

15:15.480 --> 15:18.005
"GOURMET CUISINE
AND AN ARRAY OF ACTIVITIES

15:18.110 --> 15:20.340
"ARE JUST SOME OF THE PLEASURES
AWAITING OUR GUESTS AT

15:20.450 --> 15:23.544
THE ROMANTIC REFUGE
THAT IS LOS LOMOS."

15:23.650 --> 15:25.208
I HOPE THERE'S
SHUFFLEBOARD.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.582
( laughing )

15:26.690 --> 15:28.908
I'M SERIOUS, THEY HAD IT
AT THIS PLACE IN SANTA BARBARA

15:29.020 --> 15:30.920
MY PARENTS USED TO TAKE US
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.622
I REALLY HAD
A KNACK FOR IT.

15:32.730 --> 15:35.028
IT WAS THE ONLY THING
I COULD EVER BEAT NATE AT.

15:35.130 --> 15:37.325
"THE PICTURESQUE VILLAGE
NEARBY OFFERS

15:37.430 --> 15:40.137
"VISITORS SOPHISTICATED
RESTAURANTS, ART GALLERIES,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.538
ANTIQUE
AND SPECIALTY SHOPS."

15:42.640 --> 15:45.461
I JUST WANT TO SIT BY THE POOL
AND DRINK PINA COLADAS ALL DAY.

15:45.570 --> 15:51.543
* IF YOU LIKE PINA COLADAS
AND GETTING CAUGHT IN THE *

15:51.650 --> 15:53.914
WHOOPS, DOES
THAT COUNT ?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.112
YES, IT DOES.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.642
YOU OWE ME A DOLLAR.
BUT I STOPPED !

15:56.750 --> 15:57.819
I STOPPED !

15:57.920 --> 15:59.148
ALRIGHT, 50 CENTS.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.956
I SHOULD GET A DOLLAR
EVERY TIME YOU SAY

16:01.060 --> 16:02.812
THE WORD "CALORIE"
OR "CARB".

16:02.920 --> 16:03.887
HOW OFI'EN
DO I SAY THOSE ?

16:03.990 --> 16:05.924
A LOT,
MORE THAN I SING.

16:06.030 --> 16:07.429
I DON'T
THINK SO.

16:07.530 --> 16:12.422
( radio chatter)

16:14.300 --> 16:16.234
( male )
eight different
segments.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.898
Tell us the significance of
those eight segments

16:18.010 --> 16:19.432
to the story of life.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.407
In fact, we've just taken
the animal portion of life

16:22.510 --> 16:26.469
and in terms_of
anImal evolution,

16:26.580 --> 16:30.448
there's been some great, new
work over the last few years

16:30.550 --> 16:32.939
that's really been able
to uncover a story

16:33.060 --> 16:35.688
of how this great diversity
of animal life

16:35.790 --> 16:38.350
we share the planet today
with has come about.

16:38.460 --> 16:41.952
And it turns out that there_are
really a million or so speCIes

16:42.060 --> 16:45.621
of animals that scientists
have given names to.

16:45.730 --> 16:49.769
There are really only eight
different body plans...

16:56.680 --> 16:58.500
WHATCHA DOING ?

16:58.610 --> 17:01.317
PUMPING.

17:01.950 --> 17:04.145
MMMOOOOO !

17:04.250 --> 17:06.184
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
FEEL EVEN SEXIER

17:06.290 --> 17:09.384
THAN I ALREADY DO
AT THIS MOMENT.

17:11.190 --> 17:12.748
YOU'RE CRAZY.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.896
YOU COULDN'T
BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.456
YOU'RE LIKE
A FOUNTAIN OF LIFE.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.788
EW.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.334
SHE'S STILL
SLEEPING ?

17:20.440 --> 17:23.409
DID CAROL SNEAK IN HERE
AND SLIP HER SOME COGNAC ?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.034
HARDLY, SHE MISSED
HER EARLY NAP

17:25.140 --> 17:26.607
BECAUSE I HAD TO USE
THE BLENDER ALL MORNING.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.371
WHERE DID YOU PARK ?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.504
IN THE STREET.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.908
AND SHE COULD'VE TOTALLY
GO'I'I'EN OUT THIS MORNING.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.341
OF COURSE.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.042
BUT THE REALITY IS SHE HAS
TROUBLE DRIVING IN REVERSE,

17:35.150 --> 17:37.380
SO, IT MAKES HER NERVOUS
TO HAVE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.014
SHE JUST DOESN'T
WANT PEOPLE TO THINK

17:39.120 --> 17:40.656
SHE DRIVES
AN AMERICAN CAR.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.658
WHATEVER.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.819
LET'S DO OUR PART
FOR PEACE.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.429
EW!

18:00.540 --> 18:03.839
HI, HOMOS !

18:03.950 --> 18:06.145
THAT'S MY SON,
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.717
FUDGE PACKERS !

18:07.820 --> 18:09.242
PILLOW BITERS.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.647
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A FAMILY PLACE.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.843
TWINKLE TOES !

18:12.950 --> 18:15.657
FAGGOTY-ASS FAGGOTS.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.759
( female )
HONEY, YOU BETTER
TURN OVER !

18:36.410 --> 18:39.208
HERE'S SOME SHADE FOR YOU
RIGHT HERE, HONEY.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.887
( loud screeching )

18:52.460 --> 18:54.599
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM !

18:54.700 --> 18:56.759
HE CAN SLEEP
THROUGH A DIRTY BOMB.

18:56.860 --> 18:57.963
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET UP.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.298
PLEASE, I NEED
THE EXERCISE.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.038
ALL WE'VE DONE SINCE
WE GOT HERE IS EAT.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.994
AND THE FOOD'S
NOT EVEN THAT GOOD.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.931
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.031
BUT I HEARD THE GIRL
WHO DOES THE AQUA HIP HOP CLASS

19:07.140 --> 19:08.573
IS TERRIFIC.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.272
IF YOU CAN GET YOURSELF INTO
THE POOL AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.472
THANKS FOR
THE TIP.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.877
I'M SHEILA,
BY THE WAY.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.015
HI.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.873
( loud screeching )

19:20.320 --> 19:22.754
HEY, SMILE !

19:22.860 --> 19:25.328
SO, ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR PINA COLADA ?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.591
OH GOD, NO, THEN THEY'LL
REALLY THINK WE'RE GAY.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.053
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.264
I JUST THINK PEOPLE HERE ARE
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.997
YEAH, LIKE WHO ?

19:33.100 --> 19:35.091
WASN'T THAT LADY
OVER THERE NICE TO YOU ?

19:35.200 --> 19:36.758
YES, WE HAVE AN AEROBICS
DATE TOMORROW MORNING.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.929
AND THEN AFTERWARDS WE'RE ALL
GOING TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.598
I'LL JUST
TAKE A BEER.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.734
NOT LITE.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.240
HEY, WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING A PICTURE OF US ?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.341
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.940
SMILE !

19:54.820 --> 19:56.412
OH NO,
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.488
I WAS ON THE VERGE OF
GETTING AN IMPULSE HAIRCUT.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.182
THOSE NEVER
WORK OUT.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.494
WHO DO YOU USE ?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.056
I HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE NEW.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.627
I JUST GO
TO SUPERCUTS.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.197
YOU CAN'T
DO THAT !

20:06.300 --> 20:07.528
BETTINA !

20:07.640 --> 20:10.063
A WOMAN'S HAIR IS THE GATEWAY
TO HER SENSUALITY.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.776
NOT THE HAIR
ON HER HEAD, HONEY.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.277
WHAT DO U THINK ?

20:16.380 --> 20:18.746
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TRY IT ON.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.976
NO, NO,
IT'S FOR YOU.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.115
OH...

20:21.220 --> 20:22.539
THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY MY STYLE.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.744
SWEETIE, I SAY THIS
WITH A HEART FULL OF LOVE,

20:25.850 --> 20:28.387
BUT YOUR STYLE COULD USE
A TINY SHOT OF ADRENALINE.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.048
I LIKE
A CLASSIC LOOK.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.698
TRY IT,
JUST FOR FUN.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.627
NICE !

20:39.730 --> 20:41.061
I DON'T KNOW.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.899
ISN'T IT
A LITTLE TRENDY ?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.206
ARE YOU
KIDDING ME ?

20:44.310 --> 20:45.800
IT'S PERFECT.

20:45.910 --> 20:48.504
AND 30% OFF.

20:49.610 --> 20:54.013
OKAY, NOW TRY
THE GOLD SILK NUMBER.

20:56.020 --> 20:59.387
( laughing )

20:59.490 --> 21:01.185
I'M SO PSYCHED
FOR VALERIE DOANE.

21:01.290 --> 21:02.848
HER SCULPTURE
IS AMAZING.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.120
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ?

21:04.230 --> 21:05.185
SHE'S NOT COMING
THIS SEMESTER.

21:05.290 --> 21:06.587
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

21:06.690 --> 21:08.226
THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
I TOOK THIS COURSE.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.399
YEAH, I KNOW,
YOU AND EVERYBODY.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.899
BUT SHE GOT SOME KIND
OF TRAVEL GRANT,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.127
SO, SHE'S IN ISRAEL AND NOW,
WE HAVE SOME OTHER GUY COMING.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.369
THAT SUCKS !

21:15.470 --> 21:17.301
THIS PLACE IS
FUCKING LAME.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.809
IT'S JUST ONE CLASS.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.673
I KNOW BUT NOTHING'S TURNING OUT
TO BE AS GOOD AS IT LOOKED

21:20.780 --> 21:23.032
IN THE CATALOG.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.568
WHO'S THIS
OTHER GUY ?

21:26.680 --> 21:28.170
OLIVER SOMETHING
SOMETHING.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.316
OLIVIER CASTRO-STAAL.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.183
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AWESOME.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.383
'CAUSE I HEARD HE WAS
KIND OF ON HIS OWN TRIP.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.651
WELL, VALERIE DOANE'S
INCOHERENT.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.955
I TOOK A SEMINAR
WITH HER AT BAMF,

21:40.060 --> 21:42.426
IT WAS GARBAGE.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.706
WAS THAT HIM ?

21:58.410 --> 22:01.140
THIS IS
THE WRONG ROOM...

22:01.250 --> 22:03.389
ARE YOU HERE FOR
"FORM IN SPACE" ?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.117
THIS IS
THE RIGHT ROOM.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.209
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A STUDIO CLASS ?

22:06.320 --> 22:07.514
THE CATALOG
SAID LECTURE.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.850
WELL, THAT'S BU LLSHIT.

22:09.960 --> 22:16.024
I DON'T DO LECTURES SO THIS
IS GOING TO BE A STUDIO CLASS.

22:16.130 --> 22:17.495
IF ANYONE NEEDS
A LECTURE

22:17.600 --> 22:19.090
FOR WHATEVER REASON PEOPLE
HAVE FOR THESE THINGS,

22:19.200 --> 22:20.929
THEN GO NOW.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.032
I WON'T
BE OFFENDED.

22:24.140 --> 22:25.767
OH, YOU CAN
JUST TALK.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.064
UM...

22:27.170 --> 22:29.968
I NEED A LECTURE
TO BALANCE OUT
MY COURSE LOAD.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.342
OKAY.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.749
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ART
IN THIS CLASS.

22:34.850 --> 22:38.445
IN THE END, I'LL PUT LECTURE
ON THE FORMS FOR THE PEOPLE

22:38.550 --> 22:40.017
WHO NEED LECTURE,

22:40.120 --> 22:41.917
AND STUDIO ON THE FORMS
FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED STUDIO.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.157
AND THAT'S IT.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.852
IF THIS UPSETS
YOUR SENSE OF ORDER,

22:44.960 --> 22:48.555
THEN YOU CAN GO NOW,
I WON'T BE OFFENDED.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.390
BUT GO NOW, SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH AMBIVALENCE

22:51.500 --> 22:53.297
IN THIS ROOM.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.038
AMBIVALENCE IS
POISON FOR ART.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.438
IF I EVER SEE ANYONE
TORMENTED OVER SOME DECISION,

22:57.540 --> 22:58.837
THIS WAY OR THAT WAY,

22:58.940 --> 23:00.578
I WILL BE OFFENDED
AND I WILL THROW YOU OUT

23:00.680 --> 23:03.376
FOR THE SAKE
OF THE CLASS.

23:09.050 --> 23:10.278
GOOD.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.484
THAT WAS
A BAD VIBE.

23:12.590 --> 23:16.151
OKAY, THERE ARE NO EASELS
IN THIS STUPID ROOM,

23:16.260 --> 23:18.478
SO, EVERYONE
GET ON THE FLOOR.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.251
GET ON THE FLOOR !

23:20.360 --> 23:23.352
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR DRAWING PADS ?

23:23.470 --> 23:25.665
WE THOUGHT THIS
WAS A LECTURE CLASS...

23:28.700 --> 23:30.759
TAKE ONE AND PASS IT.

23:30.870 --> 23:33.009
IF YOU HAVE A PENCIL,
YOU'RE LUCKY,

23:33.110 --> 23:35.533
IF YOU ONLY HAVE A PEN,
YOU'RE LUCKIER.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.505
ALRIGHT, YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
TO DRAW A PICTURE

23:37.610 --> 23:42.172
OF THE DAY IN YOUR LIFE
THAT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE.

23:43.950 --> 23:45.315
GO.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.854
WAIT, WHAT DYOU MEAN
"A PICTURE OF THE DAY" ?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.609
G0, I SAID.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.834
SHE JUICED YET ?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.498
YEAH, JUST ABOUT.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.760
HEY, YOU FILE
THAT CERTIFICATE ?

24:03.870 --> 24:06.168
CLAIRE'S GOING
TO DO IT TOMORROW.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.238
STUPID KIDS.

24:08.340 --> 24:11.707
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE SHE REALLY
SORT OF PANICKED, THOUGH ?

24:11.810 --> 24:14.142
MAYBE SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE...

24:14.250 --> 24:16.616
I DON'T KNOW.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.314
VANESSA GETS
SCARED ALL THE TIME.

24:19.420 --> 24:22.014
EVEN WHEN SHE'S OUT WITH
THE KIDS, SHE GETS IT.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.724
ASK LISA.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.559
I'M NOT SURE LISA GETS IT
THAT MUCH, I MEAN,

24:25.660 --> 24:27.355
SHE DOESN'T WEAR HIGH HEELS
OR TIGHT SKIRTS OR ANYTHING.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.859
VANESSA SAYS
SHE GETS IT EVEN

24:28.960 --> 24:30.621
WHEN SHE'S WEARING
HER BIG FAT SWEATPANTS.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.960
BUT YOU KNOW,
SHE'S PRETTY HOT.

24:33.070 --> 24:34.469
LISA'S HOT.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.162
YEAH, LISA'S HOT.

24:36.270 --> 24:40.104
I JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR WIFE LIKE THAT.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.338
WHEN DOES IT STOP SOUNDING WEIRD
THAT SOMEONE'S YOUR "WIFE" ?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.873
VANESSA FELT
LIKE MY WIFE

24:44.980 --> 24:47.107
ALREADY WHEN
WE WERE 16 YEARS OLD.

24:47.210 --> 24:49.610
HMM.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.039
HEY, LISTEN, NATE.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.186
THE FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE,
FOR MOST PEOPLE,

24:53.290 --> 24:57.112
IS THE HARDEST, ESPECIALLY
WITH A BABY ON TOP, TOO.

24:57.220 --> 24:59.154
THAT COULD BE TOUGH
FOR ANYONE.

24:59.260 --> 25:01.296
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S GREAT.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.597
IT IS,
I'M TOTALLY INTO IT.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.089
ALRIGHT, I'M JUST SAYING,
EVEN IF SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.395
THAT'S NORMAL.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.764
I'M INTO IT.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.721
( knocking )

25:32.830 --> 25:35.526
COME IN.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.465
ARE YOU
FEELING BETTER ?

25:43.570 --> 25:46.266
YOU'RE A LITTLE
LATE WITH THIS.

25:46.370 --> 25:49.806
I HAD TO GO
AND GET MORE PSYLLIUM.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.673
OH, GOD.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.338
THE BABY'S HERE.

25:53.450 --> 25:54.769
I'M SORRY.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.677
WE HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT
THE CHILD CARE THING.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.714
I TRIED TO CALL NATE'S MOM,
BUT I GUESS SHE WAS HURT

25:58.820 --> 26:01.357
WHEN I GOT SO ANGRY
ABOUT THE PEANUT BUTTER,

26:01.460 --> 26:03.724
IT REALLY COULD
HAVE MADE MAYA SICK--

26:03.830 --> 26:06.128
SWEETIE,
I'M SORRY.

26:06.230 --> 26:08.050
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR LITTLE
GIRL AND NATE'S FINE.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.618
BUT I JUST, I CAN'T
GET INTO ALL THIS.

26:11.730 --> 26:14.597
OKAY, LET'S TALK
ABOUT DINNER.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.430
MARLO'S ASSISTANT SAID

26:17.540 --> 26:19.633
SHE'S ONLY EATING RAW FOODS
AT THE MOMENT.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.231
I REALLY FEEL

26:22.340 --> 26:25.776
THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING
SENSITIVE TO ME AT ALL.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.145
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT DINNER.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.649
GOD, LISA.

26:30.750 --> 26:34.117
I MEAN, I'VE OBVIOUSLY
HAD A VERY DIFFICULT MORNING

26:34.220 --> 26:36.085
AND YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
YOUR OWN AGENDA.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.316
I DIDN'T MEAN...

26:37.420 --> 26:38.557
YOU'RE RUSHING ME
THROUGH THE MENU

26:38.660 --> 26:39.957
SO YOU CAN GO DEAL
WITH YOUR BABY.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.197
SHE'S FINE.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.029
I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HER AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

26:43.130 --> 26:46.395
WELL, I REALLY FELT IT EARLIER
WHEN I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN,

26:46.500 --> 26:50.197
BUT THE BABY WAS CRYING AND THAT
WAS CLEARLY YOUR PRIORITY.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.904
NO ONE WAS
WATCHING HER.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.808
THAT IS NOT
MY PROBLEM !

26:54.910 --> 26:58.971
WHEN I HIRED YOU FOR THIS JOB,
YOU WERE TOTALLY UNENCUMBERED.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.868
AND NOW, NOW THERE'S
NATE AND HIS DIRTY CAR

27:02.980 --> 27:05.312
AND THE HER
AND HER NEEDS--

27:05.420 --> 27:08.480
NATE AND THE BABY HAVE NOT
AFFECTED MY COOKING AT ALL.

27:08.590 --> 27:11.252
THEY HAVE AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY
TO SUPPORT ME EMOTIONALLY.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.397
AND YOU LIVE
IN MY HOUSE !

27:14.500 --> 27:15.489
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST I DO ?

27:15.600 --> 27:16.749
PUT MAYA UP
FOR ADOPTION ?

27:16.860 --> 27:19.328
OH, I'VE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH MY THERAPIST,

27:19.430 --> 27:20.931
AND SHE'S VERY CONCERNED
BY THE WAY

27:21.040 --> 27:22.735
THAT I ALLOW YOU
TO TREAT ME,

27:22.840 --> 27:24.762
BECAUSE I--
OH MY GOD--

27:24.870 --> 27:27.805
REQUIRE, AND I FUCKING DESERVE,
A LOT MORE ATTENTION,

27:27.910 --> 27:29.832
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.374
I WILL NOT FEEL
ASHAMED ABOUT THAT.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.369
IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU WERE HIRING ME

27:35.480 --> 27:36.777
TO BE YOUR FUCKING
WET NURSE,

27:36.880 --> 27:38.609
I WOULD'VE ASKED FOR
HEALTH INSURANCE.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.278
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?

27:40.390 --> 27:43.188
LISA, LISA ?!

27:43.290 --> 27:44.882
LISA, GODDAMN IT !

27:44.990 --> 27:49.723
THE MOMENT WAS WHEN
MY FRIEND O-D'D.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.361
HM.

27:52.470 --> 27:56.361
WRITE DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER
YOUR FAVORITE ARTIST.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.404
IN FACT,
EVERYONE DO THIS.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.405
IS IT KANDINSKY ?

28:06.510 --> 28:09.809
LET'S SEE.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.542
BECAUSE YOU'RE USING
KANDINSKY'S LANGUAGE HERE.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.481
IT'S THE SAME WITH
MOST OF THESE DRAWINGS.

28:15.590 --> 28:17.854
WE DESPISE
OURSELVES SO MUCH,

28:17.960 --> 28:20.383
THAT WE CONSIDER OUR OWN POINT
OF VIEW IS TRIVIAL.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.890
BUT THAT'S BULLSHIT,
THAT'S YOUR FATHER TALKING.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.525
OR WHATEVER BAD TEACHERS
YOU HAD BEFORE ME.

28:25.630 --> 28:28.667
YOU WITH
THE RED HAIR.

28:28.770 --> 28:29.668
WHO DID YOU WRITE ?

28:29.770 --> 28:31.328
HOPPER ?

28:31.440 --> 28:33.635
NO, I WROTE
MODIGLIANI.

28:33.740 --> 28:34.968
WERE YOU LYING ?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.809
NO, BUT I ALSO
WROTE NAN GOLDIN,

28:36.910 --> 28:38.138
BECAUSE I'M REALLY
MORE INTO PHOTOGRAPHY--

28:38.250 --> 28:41.139
WHEN DID YOU SEE
THE HOPPER SHOW AT MOCA ?

28:41.250 --> 28:43.810
LAST WEEK.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.388
OKAY, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

28:46.490 --> 28:49.414
SHE SEES 50 PAINTINGS BY HOPPER,
SHE STARTS TO DRAW LIKE HIM,

28:49.520 --> 28:53.183
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER THAN
DRAWING FROM THE EYE INSIDE.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.656
YEAH, BUT ARTISTS
GET INFLUENCED BY ART,

28:55.760 --> 28:57.159
THAT'S PART OF
THE PROCESS.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.262
UNTIL YOU LOCATE
THE INSIDE EYE,

28:59.370 --> 29:02.828
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT,
IT'S LIKE A COLORING BOOK.

29:02.940 --> 29:05.761
EVERY WORK YOU MAKE HAS
TO BE A SURPRISE TO THE EARTH.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.475
A SEEING THAT
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE

29:08.580 --> 29:11.845
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
EXACTLY WHAT IS INSIDE OF YOU

29:11.950 --> 29:16.011
CONFRONTS EXACTLY
WHAT IS OUTSIDE OF YOU.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.880
OKAY, NEXT !

29:22.560 --> 29:23.686
DEFINITELY.

29:23.790 --> 29:24.984
AND THE BLACK SUIT.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.921
AND THE COCKTAIL DRESS.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.725
OH, I'M NOT
BUYING ANYTHING.

29:28.830 --> 29:30.491
WHY NOT ?

29:30.600 --> 29:31.862
NOTHING WAS
PERFECT.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.268
NOTHING IN LIFE
IS PERFECT.

29:34.370 --> 29:36.588
WELL, THAT MAKES IT EASY
TO STAY WITHIN A BUDGET.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.100
IF YOU DON'T
BUY THIS BLACK SUIT,

29:39.210 --> 29:41.201
I'M GONNA
BUY IT FOR YOU.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.006
THAT'S THE SWEETEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD,

29:44.110 --> 29:46.442
BUT I'D JUST RETURN IT
AND GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

29:46.550 --> 29:47.608
UCH.

29:47.710 --> 29:49.746
FINE.

29:49.850 --> 29:52.512
I'M GOING TO GO BACK
FOR THE SANDALS.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.923
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THIS ?

29:59.030 --> 30:00.224
JUST LEAVE THAT THERE,

30:00.330 --> 30:01.957
TH EY'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT FOR YOU.

30:02.060 --> 30:05.223
I KNOW, BUT IT
SEEMS SO RUDE.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.738
WONDERFUL COLOR
FOR YOU.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.660
HOW MUCH ?

30:10.770 --> 30:12.931
TOO MUCH.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.974
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

30:15.080 --> 30:17.640
IT'S ONE OF
MY LITTLE PLEASURES.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.207
BETTINA !

30:19.310 --> 30:20.402
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

30:20.510 --> 30:22.944
IF THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE
$350 FOR A PIECE OF FABRIC

30:23.050 --> 30:25.780
THAT COSTS 20 BUCKS TO MAKE,
THEY SHOULD LOSE A FEW.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.380
YOU WANT ONE ?

30:27.490 --> 30:31.051
I CERTAINLY DO NOT !

30:31.160 --> 30:32.923
IT WOULD BE
A GREAT HELP TO ME

30:33.030 --> 30:36.249
IF YOU TRIED TO LOOK
A LITTLE LESS SUSPICIOUS.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.397
FORTUNATELY,
WOMEN OUR AGE ARE INVISIBLE,

30:39.500 --> 30:43.266
SO, WE CAN REALLY
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.401
( groaning )

30:51.510 --> 30:53.068
WHAT ?

30:53.180 --> 30:56.843
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE STUPID FIESTA BARBECUE.

30:56.950 --> 30:59.418
OH, COME ON,
IT'LL BE FUN.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.750
WHAT'S FUN ABOUT
STANDING AROUND A POOL

31:01.860 --> 31:04.078
WITH A BUNCH OF STRAIGHT
PEOPLE SHAKING MARACAS ?

31:04.190 --> 31:06.249
THERE'S GOING
TO BE A MARIACHI BAND.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.294
WHY CAN'T THERE BE JUST
ONE OTHER GAY COUPLE ?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.550
SOME LESBIANS FROM
THE BAY AREA ?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.696
HEY, THAT KID
IN THE POOL WAS GAY.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.597
THE 11-YEAR-OLD ?

31:14.700 --> 31:16.839
OH DAVID, RELAX.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.532
YOU'RE LETTING
THIS MATTER TOO MUCH.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.437
I'M SORRY, BUT
SOMETIMES I JUST GET

31:20.540 --> 31:22.804
EXHAUSTED BY THE RUNNING
COMMENTARY IN MY HEAD ALL DAY

31:22.910 --> 31:24.207
LONG ABOUT HOW TO BE.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.175
"IS THIS SHIRT
TOO TIGHT,"

31:26.280 --> 31:27.474
"IS THAT GESTURE
TOO FLAMBOYANT,"

31:27.580 --> 31:29.775
"WHO AM I OFFENDING
JUST BY BEING HERE ?"

31:29.880 --> 31:31.108
MAYBE YOU'RE
BEYOND ALL THAT,

31:31.220 --> 31:35.384
BUT I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
YOU'D AT LEAST UNDERSTAND.

31:36.690 --> 31:37.918
IT WOULD JUST BE NICE,
ON VACATION,

31:38.030 --> 31:39.486
TO NOT HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

31:39.590 --> 31:40.579
SO, DON'T.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.918
OFFEND PEOPLE,
WHO CARES ?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.520
WE PAID FOR
OUR ROOM, RIGHT ?

31:43.630 --> 31:46.599
I CAN'T JUST
TURN IT ON AND OFF.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.190
WELL, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TRY.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.963
NO ONE GETS A BREAK FROM
THR REALITY, YOU KNOW ?

31:56.310 --> 31:58.175
MEXICAN FOOD
GIVES ME THE RUNS.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.077
AND WHAT ABOUT
WHAT FRANK SAID ?

32:00.180 --> 32:03.115
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I HAVE THE RUNS.

32:03.220 --> 32:07.338
NO, ABOUT US BEING
LESS ISOLATED.

32:13.290 --> 32:15.827
I'M NOT DOING
A LIMBO CONTEST.

32:15.930 --> 32:17.750
THAT'S HAWAIIAN.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.293
WELL, GOOD.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.765
BUT IF THERE IS ONE, YOU'D
BE A FOOL NOT TO ENTER IT.

32:20.870 --> 32:23.236
YOU KNOW
YOU'D WIN THAT THING.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.174
IT MAKES
YOU LOOK 20.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.178
GET IT.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.633
DO I WANT
TO LOOK 20 ?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.446
OKAY, IT MAKES
YOU LOOK 30.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.974
FOR $15 I COULD BUY
A BAG OF GROCERIES.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.980
OH YEAH, BUT
A BAG OF GROCERIES

32:38.090 --> 32:40.411
DOESN'T MAKE YOU WANT
TO LOOK AT YOURSELF.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.784
EXCUSE ME,
EXCUSE ME.

32:42.890 --> 32:45.825
I'D LIKE
TO GET THIS.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.227
"FLIRTATION ?"

32:47.330 --> 32:49.059
LET ME SEE
IF WE HAVE ANY LEI-T.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.593
IT'S VERY POPULAR.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.895
HMM.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.638
WE MAY BE OUT.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.368
OH, SHE FOUND IT !

32:57.470 --> 33:00.234
NO NO, SORRY.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.138
WRONG ONE,
KEEP LOOKING.

33:08.150 --> 33:10.311
WE'RE ALL SOLD OUT.

33:10.420 --> 33:13.742
OH, ALRIGHT THEN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

33:13.850 --> 33:16.114
MM-HMM, BYE-BYE.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.695
THANK YOU.

33:43.780 --> 33:47.386
OH, DAVID,
SALSA, COME ON !

33:47.490 --> 33:49.048
WELL, WHAT DO
WE DO FOR DINNER ?

33:49.160 --> 33:50.582
GO TO THAT
CHEESY TOWN ?

33:50.690 --> 33:52.453
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF OUTLET
MALLS AND CHAIN RESTAURANTS.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.926
THE ROOM SERVICE MENU
LOOKED LIKE HEAVEN.

33:55.030 --> 33:57.658
GOOD, LET'S GO.

33:57.760 --> 34:01.025
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE
WE CAN GET REALLY DRUNK.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.842
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

34:12.950 --> 34:13.974
I QUIT.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.638
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

34:15.750 --> 34:16.842
WHOA, WHAT ?

34:16.950 --> 34:18.918
I WOULD RATHER
LIVE ON THE STREET

34:19.020 --> 34:20.339
AND BEG FOR RICE
WITH A BOWL

34:20.450 --> 34:23.487
THAN SPEND ONE MORE NIGHT
UNDER THIS ROOF.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.498
ALRIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

34:28.600 --> 34:33.469
SHE JUST UNLEASHED
SO MUCH INSANITY AT US.

34:33.570 --> 34:36.937
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR MAYA
TO BE AROUND

34:37.040 --> 34:38.860
THAT KIND OF
HOSTILE DEMENTIA.

34:38.970 --> 34:40.801
IF THAT'S WHAT I WANTED FOR HER,
I'D BE LIVING WITH MY MOTHER.

34:40.910 --> 34:43.231
I'M NOT SURE MAYA'S REALLY
THAT IN TOUCH WITH IT--

34:43.340 --> 34:45.240
SHE'S VERY
ABSORBENT !

34:45.350 --> 34:47.341
OKAY.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.140
I KIND OF WISH WE COULD
HAVE TALKED THIS THROUGH

34:53.250 --> 34:55.855
BEFORE YOU QUIT.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.019
DID YOU
ACTUALLY QUIT ?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.358
YES, I ACTUALLY QUIT !

34:59.460 --> 35:02.224
WE HAVE TO LEAVE
TOMORROW MORNING !

35:08.300 --> 35:10.131
SO, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING,

35:10.240 --> 35:11.764
THAT WE'D GO STAY AT
MY MOM'S, I GUESS ?

35:11.870 --> 35:13.428
WELL, YEAH,
FOR NOW.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.974
THAT'S NOT THE WORST THING
THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN, IS IT ?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.105
NO...

35:18.210 --> 35:20.201
IT'S NOT THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED EITHER...

35:20.310 --> 35:22.915
I'M SORRY,
I SNAPPED.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.512
MY HUMANITY JUST
ROSE UP.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.808
C'MERE.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.059
OKAY.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.526
ALRIGHT.

35:35.630 --> 35:39.623
(crying )

35:41.500 --> 35:43.036
OH, MY GOD !

35:43.140 --> 35:44.835
SHH !

35:44.940 --> 35:47.534
TH ESE WALLS ARE
LIKE PAPER.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.699
( moaning )

35:49.810 --> 35:51.698
SO FUCKING WHAT ?

35:51.810 --> 35:53.368
WE'RE ON VACATION,

35:53.480 --> 35:55.175
YEAH, WE'RE GAY

35:55.280 --> 35:56.838

36:13.400 --> 36:17.598

36:20.970 --> 36:24.599

36:24.710 --> 36:26.109
* UPTIGHT

36:26.210 --> 36:27.871
* OUT OF SIGHT

36:27.980 --> 36:31.586
* I'M A POOR MAN'S SON FROM
ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS *

36:31.690 --> 36:35.057
* THE ONLY SHIRT I HAVE
IS HANGING ON MY BACK *

36:35.160 --> 36:39.085
* BUT I'M THE ENW OF
EVERY SINGLE GUY *

36:39.190 --> 36:42.296

36:54.070 --> 36:57.198

DAMN IT !

37:02.820 --> 37:04.549
BE CAREFUL !

37:04.650 --> 37:06.186
SORRY.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.451
LISA, YOU'RE CARRYING
TOO MUCH.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.529
IT'S FINE, I JUST DIDN'T
REALIZE HOW TALL IT WAS.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.766
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF
DAVID'S FURNITURE YOU NEED.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.691
BUT HE HAS SOME LOVELY PIECES
STORED IN THE GARAGE.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.509
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING,
JUST THAT ROCKING CHAIR...

37:27.070 --> 37:28.901
IT'S A MUCH BETTER SPACE
THAN CAROL'S.

37:29.010 --> 37:30.637
IT'S BIGGER...

37:30.740 --> 37:31.968
YEAH.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.809
THERE'S NO KITCHEN.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.719
I TOLD LISA, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COOK IN THE HOUSE

37:35.820 --> 37:36.616
WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.914
THAN KS.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.715
IT WON'T BE FOR
TOO LONG, RUTH.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.651
I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.726
RUTH, YOU CAN
PICK HER UP.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.902
THAT'S NICE
LIPSTICK, MOM.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.899
THANK YOU, DEAR,
IT'S NEW.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.807
HEY.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.716
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
PUT DOWN YOUR CHARCOAL.

38:21.030 --> 38:25.592
OKAY, THIS IS IT.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.729
CAN YOU SEE
WHY THIS IS GOOD ?

38:34.310 --> 38:37.700
BECAUSE IT'S
IN HER OWN LANGUAGE ?

38:37.810 --> 38:41.200
YES, BUT THE WAY I TELL
IF SOMETHING IS GOOD IS...

38:41.310 --> 38:44.416
DOES IT MAKE ME
WANT TO THROW UP ?

38:44.520 --> 38:47.512
THIS DRAWING INSTANTLY
MAKES ME FEEL NAUSEOUS.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.554
YOU CAN TELL IF
SOMETHING IS TRUTHFUL,

38:49.660 --> 38:52.424
EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,
IF IT AFFECT S YOUR BODY.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.623
YOUR LIVER
AND YOUR BOWELS

38:54.730 --> 38:57.221
ARE MORE IMPORTANT
AS AN ARTIST THAN YOUR EYES.

38:57.330 --> 38:59.264
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR AWAY
FROM YOUR BRAIN.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.122
I DON'T KNOW.

39:01.230 --> 39:03.232
I THINK IT SEEMS
KIND OF OBVIOUS.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.604
BECAUSE YOU'RE
EMBARRASSED BY YOURSELF.

39:05.710 --> 39:10.079
IN THE BEGINNING,
IF YOU HATE SOMETHING,

39:10.180 --> 39:11.772
'5 GOOD.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.849
BECAUSE YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
THE BEAUTY OF YOUR OWN TRUTH.

39:14.950 --> 39:16.770
YOU'RE USED TO BEING
A NORMAL PATHETIC HUMAN

39:16.880 --> 39:19.542
WHO DOES ONLY WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE WANT.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.312
BUT WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE
REALLY WANT IS TO FUCK YOU

39:22.420 --> 39:24.650
AND TO MAKE
MONEY OFF YOU

39:24.760 --> 39:26.159
AND TO HANG YOU
IN THE LIVING ROOM

39:26.260 --> 39:27.989
WITH THE FANCY
SECURITY SYSTEM.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.523
LIKE THIS !

39:29.630 --> 39:31.188
WHO DID YOU MAKE
THIS TO PLEASE ?

39:31.300 --> 39:32.619
ME?

39:32.730 --> 39:34.459
YOUR MOTHER,
YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

39:34.570 --> 39:37.767
DOES ANYONE
FEEL SICK FROM THIS ?

39:37.870 --> 39:39.406
NO.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.728
SO WHO
THE FUCK CARES ?

39:59.060 --> 40:01.949
I'M A FRIEND
OF CALLIE'S.

40:02.060 --> 40:05.826
AND I WAS THERE,
THE NIGHT...

40:05.930 --> 40:08.364
SHE DIED.

40:08.470 --> 40:11.906
I WANTED TO SPEAK
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVED HER.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.377
AND I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT WHO SHE WAS TO ME,

40:15.480 --> 40:17.675
AND TO US,

40:17.780 --> 40:20.271
WHICH IS THIS
BRAVE, BRAZEN,

40:20.380 --> 40:22.848
TOTALLY HEROIC PERSON.

40:22.950 --> 40:28.217
THIS ROCK CLIMBING,
BODY SURFING,

40:28.320 --> 40:31.118
BACK TALKING,
TRUTH-OR-DARE CHAMPION.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.018
I NEVER EVEN ONCE
SAW HER SCARED...

40:34.130 --> 40:37.156
BEFORE.

40:38.600 --> 40:43.469
I GUESS WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO SAY TO HER IS...

40:43.570 --> 40:48.473
WE WERE JUST PRETENDING
TO BE THIS THING THAT WE'RE NOT,

40:48.580 --> 40:51.947
I DON'T THINK,

40:52.050 --> 40:55.713
AND THEN SHE WAS THIS THING
THAT SHE'S NOT...

40:55.820 --> 40:58.846
I'M SORRY.

40:58.950 --> 41:02.716
BUT WHEN SHE SAW
THAT IT WAS US,

41:02.820 --> 41:05.584
SHE HAD THIS LOOK,
LIKE,

41:05.690 --> 41:10.992
"HOW COULD
THIS BE YOU ?"

41:16.370 --> 41:18.964
MRS. MORTIMER ?

41:20.540 --> 41:23.668
( sobbing )

41:48.030 --> 41:50.863
I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

41:50.970 --> 41:52.506
WHAT ?

41:52.610 --> 41:54.066
THE MOTHER,
MRS. MORTIMER.

41:54.170 --> 41:56.070
YOU KNOW, I JUST, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.432
YOU DON'T REALLY
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.245
I DIDN'T.

42:00.350 --> 42:01.669
YEAH, BUT LIKE--

42:01.780 --> 42:03.714
HUG HER,
DON'T HUG HER.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.617
YOU KNOW,
I FREEZE UP.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.017
YOU CAN'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.758
YOU JUST HAVE TO REALLY
BE THERE WITH THEM.

42:08.860 --> 42:09.781
JUST...

42:09.890 --> 42:12.552
BE PRESENT.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.294
I DON'T
THINK I CAN.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.561
SURE YOU CAN.

42:19.670 --> 42:23.128
NO, DOWNSTAIRS,
IT'S JUST A BODY.

42:23.240 --> 42:27.836
BUT UP HERE, LIKE THIS
YOUNG GIRL, YOU KNOW,

42:27.940 --> 42:30.306
SHE'S SOMEONE'S SISTER,
AND SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER.

42:30.410 --> 42:31.968
I CAN'T HELP
BUT TO THINK

42:32.080 --> 42:35.675
WHAT IF IT WAS JULIO,
OR VANESSA, EVEN ?

42:35.780 --> 42:39.113
AND I JUST CAN'T...

42:41.120 --> 42:43.452
YOU DON'T EVER THINK,
"WHAT IF IT WAS MAYA ?

42:43.560 --> 42:44.629
WHAT IF IT WAS LISA ?"

42:44.730 --> 42:46.186
I DON'T,
ACTUALLY.

42:46.290 --> 42:47.757
NOT THEM.

42:47.860 --> 42:50.988
I CAN'T BRING THEM
IN HERE WITH ME, YOU KNOW ?

42:51.100 --> 42:53.967
I JUST WANT THEM TO BE
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT LIFE.

42:54.070 --> 42:58.234
THAT WAY I CAN COME HERE
AND DEAL WITH WHAT ISN'T.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.749
WELL, YOU'RE
LUCKY THEN.

43:14.690 --> 43:17.318
SO, HOW'D IT GO
LAST NIGHT ?

43:17.420 --> 43:18.648
AWESOME.

43:18.760 --> 43:21.126
I MEAN, WE SCREWED UP A LOT,
BUT NO ONE NOTICED.

43:21.230 --> 43:24.154
IT WAS
FUCKING LOUD.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.296
EVERYONE WAS WALKING AROUND
WITH LIKE COCKTAIL NAPKINS

43:26.400 --> 43:28.197
IN THEIR EARS.

43:28.300 --> 43:30.029
SO, LISTEN.

43:30.140 --> 43:33.303
I KIND OF WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE

43:33.410 --> 43:35.401
"SEEING OTHER PEOPLE"
THING.

43:35.510 --> 43:37.603
OKAY.

43:40.910 --> 43:44.141
I'M NOT THAT
INTO IT.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.478
OKAY.

43:45.590 --> 43:48.582
I MEAN...

43:48.690 --> 43:52.581
IT MAKES ME FEEL WEIRD,
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,

43:52.690 --> 43:54.851
IF PEOPLE ARE
INTO EACH OTHER,

43:54.960 --> 43:57.554
THEN, THAT SHOULD BE,
PRETTY MUCH ENOUGH.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.298
YOU KNOW ?

43:59.400 --> 44:01.493
AT SOME POINT, YEAH.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.592
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

44:04.710 --> 44:08.532
LIKE WHEN IT GETS REALLY
SERIOUS OR WHATEVER.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.471
WELL, WHEN DOES THAT
USUALLY HAPPEN FOR YOU ?

44:10.580 --> 44:12.207
IT DEPENDS.

44:12.310 --> 44:16.542
OKAY, WELL, HOW ABOUT LIKE
AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS ?

44:16.650 --> 44:18.345
YOU MEAN LIKE US,
NOW ?

44:18.450 --> 44:19.644
YEAH.

44:19.750 --> 44:22.253
I DON'T KNOW.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.553
OKAY...

44:25.660 --> 44:27.628
I MEAN, DO YOU ?

44:27.730 --> 44:29.994
WELL, YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I'M SAYING.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.797
IT'S JUST NOT REALLY MY THING,
TO LIKE SLEEP AROUND.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.334
I'M NOT
SLEEPING AROUND.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.703
I JUST MEAN,
I'M KIND OF A LIKE

44:41.810 --> 44:46.270
ONE AT A TIME
SEXUAL PERSON, I THINK.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.345
SO...

44:51.450 --> 44:54.578
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

44:54.690 --> 44:57.056
I DON'T THINK
I'M THERE.

44:57.160 --> 45:00.482
JUST NOT AT THIS
EXACT POINT IN TIME.

45:00.590 --> 45:02.353
WELL, WHY NOT ?

45:02.460 --> 45:04.428
IS IT 'CAUSE YOU LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE BETTER ?

45:04.530 --> 45:07.567
NO, SO TOTALLY NOT.

45:07.670 --> 45:09.865
IT'S JUST...

45:09.970 --> 45:12.200
IT KIND OF HAS TO BE
MORE ORGANIC FOR ME,

45:12.310 --> 45:14.460
LIKE NOT SOME KIND
OF CONTRACT OR WHATEVER.

45:14.570 --> 45:17.698
IT HAS TO EVOLVE.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.173
BUT I'M NOT
SAYING IT WON'T.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.942
IT SO TOTALLY COULD.

45:25.050 --> 45:26.847
WELL, NOT FOR ME,
NOT WHEN IT'S LIKE

45:26.950 --> 45:28.349
"YOU CAN'T
COME HEAR ME PLAY

45:28.450 --> 45:31.055
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME OTHER
GIRL IS GONNA BE THERE."

45:33.460 --> 45:35.325
YEAH.

45:35.430 --> 45:38.399
OKAY.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.107

45:51.210 --> 45:53.474
I GUESS.

45:53.580 --> 45:55.878
WHOA.

45:55.980 --> 46:00.940
WELL, CAN I HAVE A HUG,
OR SOMETHING ?

46:04.660 --> 46:05.558
NO.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.981
I'M JUST
GOING TO GO.

46:25.380 --> 46:29.544
( radio playing )

46:45.370 --> 46:46.689
Remember us ?

46:46.800 --> 46:48.028
Mmm-hmm.

46:48.130 --> 46:49.939
Okay, you just called
a little while ago

46:50.040 --> 46:51.564
about needing a signature
on the admission's form.

46:51.670 --> 46:53.001
HEY!

46:53.110 --> 46:54.532
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.528
NOTHING, JUST
WATCHING THIS.

46:56.640 --> 46:59.473
OKAY, BUT YOU CAN
WATCH WITH US.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.241
ISN'T MAYA SLEEPING ?

47:01.350 --> 47:03.341
YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T MIND
THE TV, IF IT'S LOW,

47:03.450 --> 47:05.145
AND I HAVE A MILLION
THINGS I NEED TO ASK YOU.

47:05.250 --> 47:07.138
LIKE WHAT ?

47:07.250 --> 47:10.185
LIKE, WHEN DO YOU WANT
TO DO THE CHILD-PROOFING ?

47:10.290 --> 47:12.383
AND HOW SHOULD WE DEAL WITH MAYA
WHILE I LOOK FOR A JOB ?

47:12.490 --> 47:15.288
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT--

47:15.400 --> 47:16.526
THEN DON'T.

47:16.630 --> 47:18.552
NOT YET,
JUST TAKE A BREAK.

47:18.660 --> 47:19.820
WE'RE NOT
PAYING RENT.

47:19.930 --> 47:21.295
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T
STAY HERE FOREVER.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.539
NOT FOREVER, BUT WE CAN RELAX
FOR A FEW DAYS, CAN'T WE ?

47:23.640 --> 47:26.268
OKAY.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.939
ALSO, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT VACCINATING.

47:35.050 --> 47:37.075
I DOWNLOADED A TON OF
INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET

47:37.180 --> 47:38.943
AND I'M STILL
REALLY AGAINST IT,

47:39.050 --> 47:40.312
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
REALLY WEIGHED IN.

47:40.420 --> 47:42.308
GOD KNOWS
YOUR MOTHER WANTS IT.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.809
OKAY, PRINT IT OUT, I'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT IT LATER TONIGHT.

47:44.930 --> 47:47.023
OKAY.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.433

47:57.540 --> 48:00.464

48:17.720 --> 48:20.052
* MISS MY LIFE

48:20.160 --> 48:23.288

48:23.400 --> 48:24.753
THAT'S ME.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.168

48:26.270 --> 48:28.488

A VERY NICE VOICE.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.431

YOU DIDN'T ?

48:30.540 --> 48:31.393
WELL, PRACTICALLY.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.865
I JUST DON'T LIKE
WHEN YOU SING AT ME.

48:32.970 --> 48:37.134
( singing )

48:37.240 --> 48:40.607
* AND I THINK IT'S GONNA
BE A LONG, LONG TIME *

48:40.710 --> 48:44.316
* 'TIL TOUCH DOWN BRINGS ME

49:00.900 --> 49:02.788
OH, SHIT.

49:02.900 --> 49:04.868
WE'RE SUPPOSED
BE GOING AGAINST TRAFFIC.

49:04.970 --> 49:07.165
THERE MUST BE
AN ACCIDENT.

49:07.270 --> 49:09.579
* AND I THINK IT'S GONNA
BE A LONG, LONG TIME *

49:09.680 --> 49:13.309
* 'TIL TOUCH DOWN BRINGS ME

49:13.410 --> 49:15.412
LOOKS LIKE IT
MIGHT BE PICKING UP.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.011
NOT MUCH.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.578
WHO KNOWS WHEN WE'RE
GONNA GET HOME NOW.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.355
I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE STOPPED FOR FOOD.

49:25.460 --> 49:26.722
IT'S LUCKY WE DID.

49:26.830 --> 49:29.526
WE'RE GOING TO GET HOME
TOO LATE TO MAKE ANYTHING NOW.

49:29.630 --> 49:31.495
IT'S NOT MY FAULT !

49:31.600 --> 49:33.898

BE A LONG, LONG TIME *

49:48.580 --> 49:51.549
* 'TIL TOUCH DOWN BRINGS ME

49:51.650 --> 49:55.188
* I'M NOT THE MAN
