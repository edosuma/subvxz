WEBVTT

00:13.471 --> 00:15.807
(melodic glitch)

00:17.767 --> 00:20.186
(screechy clattering)

00:26.025 --> 00:28.278
(vacuum white noise)

00:47.046 --> 00:49.507
(liquid softly spurting)

00:51.301 --> 00:54.387
(faint voices)

00:55.597 --> 00:57.098
(distant city traffic)

01:21.372 --> 01:24.042
(soft snipping)

01:24.876 --> 01:27.212
(soft peeling)

01:35.178 --> 01:37.597
(melodic drone)

02:13.258 --> 02:20.139
<i>The butterflies that represent</i>
<i>our</i>
<i>visiting ancestors don't harm</i>
<i>anyone.</i>

02:20.223 --> 02:23.560
<i>Far from that. They're</i>
<i>miraculous.</i>

02:23.643 --> 02:25.478
(wind swirls)

02:25.854 --> 02:28.815
<i>I remember that my dad used to</i>
<i>say</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:32.861
that they don't make noise
when they come and go from the
sky

02:32.944 --> 02:37.031
<i>so if you have a wish and ask,</i>
<i>they will grant it.</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:41.911
(wind whoosh)

02:44.372 --> 02:46.416
(birds chirping)

02:51.129 --> 02:53.089
(wings softly fluttering)

03:19.240 --> 03:20.950
(approaching footsteps)

03:21.409 --> 03:25.955
Those butterflies look like a
bear, no?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.791
To me it looks more like someone
hanging themselves.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.251
A dead person.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.300
Hey.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.345
Imagine touching those
butterflies

03:40.428 --> 03:43.014
and then they all fly away?

03:43.097 --> 03:47.226
Yeah, it would look like a
plague
with all of them together.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.729
Come on... fly!

03:50.146 --> 03:51.356
Wow.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.115
(boy happily sighs)

04:01.950 --> 04:03.451
(wings flapping)

04:05.578 --> 04:06.579
(gentle lapping of water)

04:07.080 --> 04:09.749
-Drinking water?
-Mendel, come!

04:19.759 --> 04:22.762
<i>One morning I woke up...</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:24.514
Let's go...

04:25.390 --> 04:27.934
<i>-There were no survivors.</i>
<i>-One, two, three...</i>

04:28.810 --> 04:30.561
<i>No humans.</i>

04:31.062 --> 04:34.148
-Come here, stinker.
-No, you stink!

04:35.942 --> 04:39.195
<i>Not even the</i>
<i>resemblance of an animal.</i>

04:40.697 --> 04:42.115
<i>Only me.</i>

04:43.157 --> 04:46.119
(chainsaw buzzing, trees
falling)

04:49.914 --> 04:52.333
(dogs barking, distant voices)

05:00.299 --> 05:02.969
(dog howling)

05:07.890 --> 05:09.642
(animal figurine falls)

05:17.275 --> 05:18.860
Simón.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.029
What?

05:21.112 --> 05:26.034
Can a dead person still breathe?

05:26.451 --> 05:31.664
No, because when someone dies,
they stop existing.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.918
Simón.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.128
What?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.298
How does one stop existing?

05:41.007 --> 05:45.178
When your body vanishes,
and all that's left is your
soul,

05:45.595 --> 05:49.390
but after that, the soul
goes to heaven.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.685
And how does it go to heaven?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
In an elevator.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.107
Get some rest.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.068
Simón.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.447
What?

06:04.906 --> 06:09.869
-And what is the elevator
connected to?
-To a cloud.

06:10.328 --> 06:14.791
And... did our parents take that
elevator?

06:17.794 --> 06:18.920
Yes.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.636
Good night.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.223
-Simón.
-What now?

06:30.306 --> 06:31.432
Good night.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.602
(puffs out flame)

06:38.397 --> 06:40.191
(wind chimes clanking)

06:40.274 --> 06:42.902
(wind blowing)

06:42.985 --> 06:44.278
<i>Mendel.</i>

06:44.362 --> 06:46.114
<i>It's your uncle Gabino.</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:51.744
<i>I tried calling several times</i>
<i>but I can't get ahold of you.</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:54.997
<i>I am guessing you haven't</i>
<i>spoken to your brother.</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:56.541
<i>So...</i>

06:57.416 --> 06:58.626
<i>(coin drops)</i>

06:58.709 --> 07:01.295
<i>Your grandma is not doing so</i>
<i>well.</i>

07:01.379 --> 07:03.047
<i>Call me back.</i>

07:04.006 --> 07:06.634
<i>Hope all is well in New York.</i>

07:07.051 --> 07:08.261
<i>Goodbye, son.</i>

07:09.428 --> 07:11.806
(ambient city rumble)

07:13.724 --> 07:16.602
(traffic noises, street sounds)

07:20.314 --> 07:22.733
(distant siren wailing)

07:27.905 --> 07:30.950
(passing car whoosh)

07:37.331 --> 07:39.709
(faint reggaeton music)

07:55.141 --> 07:57.560
(brakes squealing)

08:00.021 --> 08:03.733
(small town bustle)

08:07.153 --> 08:07.987
Thank you.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.657
-Want some help?
-No, thank you.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.202
My American nephew!

08:14.911 --> 08:15.703
Uncle!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.039
-How are you?
-Good. And you?

08:18.456 --> 08:19.665
Fine.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.918
-You're taller, no?
-Yeah.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.462
What do they feed you over
there?

08:25.379 --> 08:26.797
Nothing but sausage?

08:28.674 --> 08:29.675
Exhausting?

08:29.759 --> 08:30.927
Kind of.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.847
(bus driving away)

08:42.188 --> 08:43.940
How is it going with the hotel?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.483
It's going...

08:46.484 --> 08:48.778
We're in the busy season.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.196
Right.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.782
How does it look?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.369
Nothing changed, right?

08:56.911 --> 08:59.205
Some things did.
Others didn't.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.750
Did you know that Estelita
went to study in Queretaro?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.001
No.

09:04.335 --> 09:08.130
So your aunt and I are alone
but we're okay.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.592
Welcome home.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.303
Despite the circumstances.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.516
And how are you?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.186
Hanging in there.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.232
It's not easy to lose one's
mother.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.653
But you know what your
grandma was like...

09:31.529 --> 09:36.075
She lived how she wanted...
and died when she wanted.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.161
She's resting now.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.125
They're still cutting, right?

09:45.584 --> 09:47.461
Who's going to stop them?

09:47.878 --> 09:50.673
It will soon turn into a desert.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.009
Well... they're gangs, son.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.761
The last days of the
butterflies.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.015
You see that container?

10:00.182 --> 10:03.019
See what it says?
Drinking water.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.563
You know what these assholes put
in there?

10:06.147 --> 10:06.897
Cyanide.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.818
They empty it,
remove the label and say it's
water.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.404
Motherfuckers.

10:15.364 --> 10:19.285
Why would they ever decide
to reopen the damn mine?

10:19.368 --> 10:22.455
Because people need to work,
son.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.753
-Simón is still working there?
-Yeah.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.218
Don't judge your brother.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.014
I know.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.438
But they should have
a bit of a conscience.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.150
(loud truck engine)

10:53.110 --> 10:55.404
This land belongs to no one.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.783
(nostalgic chords)

11:06.207 --> 11:08.668
(animated town life)

11:09.293 --> 11:11.045
Have you seen Vicente?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.090
Vicente?

11:15.007 --> 11:19.387
He's around, a bit lost with
his spiritual and new-age stuff.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.516
He may have gone to India
to find himself.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.936
I'm sure he did.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.275
-This will always be your home.
-Thank you, uncle.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.238
Dolores, can I have Room #2?

11:39.990 --> 11:43.285
Listen...
This kid is like my son.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.996
I'm going to write his name
here.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.383
(wind gusting)

11:58.634 --> 11:59.844
(dogs barking)

12:02.388 --> 12:03.973
(horn honking)

12:14.900 --> 12:16.652
(Mendel quivers)

12:17.403 --> 12:20.739
The big ones scare me 'cause...

12:21.699 --> 12:23.534
-Why?
-I don't know.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.287
The little animal is already
dead.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.247
(grandma exclaims)

12:31.792 --> 12:33.669
(she quietly chuckles)

12:34.044 --> 12:36.338
You look like your dad.

12:40.050 --> 12:44.763
Don't make that sad face.
That's a good thing.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.354
(heavy sigh)

12:56.525 --> 12:57.776
Let's go in, son.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.366
(soft prayers)

13:09.914 --> 13:10.706
Hi dear.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.835
Mendel.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.798
-Remember your uncle?
-No.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.385
We always show him photos of
you.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.305
Hi uncle.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.105
<i>Hi love.</i>

13:40.611 --> 13:42.738
(deep sigh)

13:48.410 --> 13:50.412
(prayers get louder)

14:29.660 --> 14:32.788
(door creaks open)

14:40.087 --> 14:41.213
Go play.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.473
-How are you?
-Good.

14:51.890 --> 14:56.687
Brisa... son, I'm heading to the
hotel.
A few Canadians just arrived.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.690
-I'll be right back.
-Don't worry. We'll be here.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.443
-Thank you dear.
-Take care, uncle.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.239
(kids playing)

15:08.699 --> 15:10.409
How are you?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.077
What's new in your life?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.454
All good.

15:13.537 --> 15:17.666
I'm working with Juan Carlos
at the hair salon in the
mornings.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.545
And Gerardo?

15:21.629 --> 15:25.090
He works in Zitacuaro.
In the copper factory.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.053
Good old Gerardo.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.600
And did you get married?

15:36.393 --> 15:37.978
Why would I get married?

15:39.688 --> 15:41.440
That's not for me.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.152
Well, you should get on it
'cause
we've all got a few kids here.

15:48.822 --> 15:53.285
Remember when we were like them
and we'd go
up the mountain to squish
people?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.245
Like this.

15:56.038 --> 15:56.747
(squish noise)

16:00.876 --> 16:03.504
Mommy, can I go to the store
to buy candy with Jesus?

16:03.921 --> 16:06.799
No, my love.
Go and play with your brothers.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.805
Will you stay for a bit?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.559
I'm leaving in two days.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.728
Right after the funeral.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.898
Well, that's a shame.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.070
If you have time and want to
stop by

16:28.821 --> 16:30.864
the house, that'd be great.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.827
Gerardo would be very happy to
see you.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.163
My love...

16:38.622 --> 16:40.708
-Don't play like that. Please!
-Mommy, it...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.168
I've told you a thousand times!

16:44.128 --> 16:44.837
Miss Janeth?

16:45.295 --> 16:46.130
Yes?

16:46.213 --> 16:50.968
My mom told me that we're
hurting planet Earth a lot.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.721
That's why I drew red lines.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.639
What Brisa is saying
is very true.

16:56.181 --> 17:02.020
We're not taking good care of
our planet.
We're hurting animals and
plants.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.691
-What do we see in Brisa's
drawing?
-Monarchs!

17:06.191 --> 17:07.443
And where do they come from?

17:07.526 --> 17:14.992
Canada. Texas.
Michoacán. Angangueo.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.204
Monarchs have super vision and
they can see us from very far.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.914
Very good, Vicente!

17:22.499 --> 17:23.917
(soft prayers)

17:26.587 --> 17:28.505
(distant Mexican folklore music)

17:45.647 --> 17:47.357
(metal clinking)

17:52.446 --> 17:53.697
(door creaks open)

17:54.323 --> 17:55.783
What are you doing?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.995
I'm just... looking.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.876
(door swinging closed)

18:14.802 --> 18:16.845
There's nothing to see.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.098
I live here with my family.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.436
This is also my house.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.194
You show up when
you feel like it.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.947
-Now you...
-Don't start with that shit.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.574
This is my house, Mendel!

18:53.382 --> 18:55.425
I also lost my grandma.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.553
(door flings open)

18:58.011 --> 19:00.222
(loud prayers)

19:10.065 --> 19:12.359
(deep sigh)

19:14.611 --> 19:16.655
(steps forward)

19:18.448 --> 19:19.741
-Goodbye.
-See you soon.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.660
Bye.
Thank you for coming.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.245
Bye, my dear.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.502
Uncle, I'm getting married.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.255
But you're still so young.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.675
My boyfriend found a job in
Toluca so...

19:37.009 --> 19:38.760
we're moving there.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.346
-When is it?
-In December.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.891
I want you to be my padrino.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.392
(he exclaims)

19:45.851 --> 19:47.895
What's your dad going to say?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.147
Nothing.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.108
You're my uncle.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.574
-I'll try.
-Yes, uncle, I want you to come.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.368
(distant drilling)

20:06.955 --> 20:08.540
(kiss)

20:09.374 --> 20:12.461
Go back inside.
I'm going to walk around.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.255
I'll be back shortly.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.970
(amplified indistinct voice)

20:22.638 --> 20:26.016
Sing. Sing. Sing.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.981
The butterfly skirt...

20:34.191 --> 20:35.734
(girls laughing)

20:36.193 --> 20:37.819
(cloth wing flapping)

20:38.362 --> 20:39.738
Monarchs!

20:40.322 --> 20:43.367
My favorite animal is the dog,
but I don't want to be one.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.701
A lion is better.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.913
I want to be a fox 'cause
I can't sleep at night.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.626
Why not a monkey?
It's the animal that looks most
like us.

20:53.210 --> 20:57.005
Yeah, but animals are
stronger than humans.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.968
I want to be a lion because
they're stronger and smarter...

21:01.051 --> 21:04.179
-Shh, Vicente! They're coming!
-The wolf will eat us.

21:04.262 --> 21:07.057
Wolf, wolf, are you there?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.476
(roaring)

21:09.559 --> 21:12.062
(Mexican folklore music)

21:12.813 --> 21:15.357
Faster, faster,
Fly... fly...

21:16.024 --> 21:17.359
(children agitated)

21:19.486 --> 21:21.154
Towards the trees...

21:23.198 --> 21:28.036
Do you hear that? What's coming?
The animals... run... hide.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.330
(tires rolling)

21:30.914 --> 21:32.541
(indistinct car radio)

21:33.166 --> 21:38.630
<i>You can rent it in pharmacies,</i>
<i>supermarkets,</i>
<i>perfume shops, natural remedy</i>
<i>stores around the country...</i>

21:41.425 --> 21:42.467
(clicks radio off)

21:47.597 --> 21:49.725
(car door shut closed)

21:54.271 --> 21:55.564
(roosters crowing)

21:55.897 --> 21:57.315
(firm handshake)

21:57.649 --> 22:00.193
(patting shoulders)

22:00.986 --> 22:02.404
What's up, Vicente?

22:02.904 --> 22:04.448
-How are you?
-Good.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.165
Damn, dude, like five years?

22:19.212 --> 22:19.963
(Vicente sniffs)

22:20.964 --> 22:22.549
I follow you on Face...

22:22.883 --> 22:24.968
But you never post anything,
man.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.058
Why didn't you come see Rosa?

22:35.771 --> 22:39.399
I have my own way of
saying goodbye to the dead.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.404
Nice boots, bro.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.407
(chuckling)

22:48.408 --> 22:50.494
I'll trade them if you want.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.624
(distant machinery)

22:56.333 --> 22:58.001
What's the deal with that guy?

22:58.085 --> 22:59.252
Who?

23:00.003 --> 23:01.546
Your president.

23:02.464 --> 23:07.302
What the hell!
That guy's not my president.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.890
Do I look orange to you?

23:13.600 --> 23:16.269
Maybe a tad over here.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.314
He thinks he offends us by
calling us animals!

23:19.856 --> 23:21.566
But we are!

23:22.776 --> 23:25.570
(mimicking animal noises)

23:29.908 --> 23:31.785
(snarling)

23:33.245 --> 23:35.497
(howling)

23:36.915 --> 23:38.166
(Vicente laughs)

23:38.667 --> 23:40.210
Are you drunk, asshole?

23:40.293 --> 23:41.670
I'm alive, asshole!

23:42.087 --> 23:46.299
(Mendel laughs, coughs)

23:52.305 --> 23:54.558
Remember when...

23:55.142 --> 23:57.394
when we lit...

23:58.562 --> 24:01.189
the fire with the Christmas
tree?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.567
(laughing)

24:05.986 --> 24:08.822
We almost burnt the entire farm,
asshole.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.116
It was your fault, man.

24:11.199 --> 24:11.783
You.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.286
-It was your idea, dude!
-No, it was all you.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.164
Who comes up with that shit?

24:23.086 --> 24:25.255
You like it over there?

24:31.761 --> 24:33.221
I don't know.

24:37.976 --> 24:41.396
(distant amplified announcement)

24:44.274 --> 24:46.818
(solemn Mexican folklore music)

24:47.402 --> 24:48.820
(town bustle)

24:49.362 --> 24:51.656
Come try the pulque,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.575
Good evening.

24:55.076 --> 24:55.827
Thank you.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.748
Don't forget your candles.

25:01.249 --> 25:04.377
(men chanting in Spanish)

25:05.545 --> 25:06.171
Grandma?

25:06.546 --> 25:09.925
Are my parents going to
eat from the ofrenda?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.302
Yes, son.
They're on the way.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.305
Yeah, they're coming
with all the dead

25:15.388 --> 25:18.099
-and will devour you alive!
-Stop that, Simón!

25:23.021 --> 25:25.065
(soft singing)

25:26.816 --> 25:29.361
You have an old soul.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.239
-An old soul?
-Yes.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.324
Remember.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.035
You're not weak.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.704
You're strong.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.460
Simón, calm down.
Stop throwing rocks.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.671
Come here.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.798
Please.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.633
(Simon sighs)

25:55.804 --> 25:56.638
Let me help.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.643
The first one here.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.603
We need to leave the knives
in the ground

26:03.687 --> 26:07.357
and then count three, four
steps,
then stab the ground with a
knife.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.776
And like this,
we'll outline five points.

26:11.152 --> 26:15.907
-With a lighter.
-Let's make sure the elements
are in place.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.451
Can you light it up with that?

26:19.911 --> 26:21.371
All good with the coins?

26:21.788 --> 26:24.040
How about the rocks?
Yes?

26:27.502 --> 26:31.131
Place the coins on the rocks...

26:33.258 --> 26:35.135
There are seven piles.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.346
One coin for each of

26:38.805 --> 26:40.557
the seven points.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.810
(clattering of precious stones)

26:44.561 --> 26:45.645
(fire crackling)

26:46.271 --> 26:48.565
We are gathered here today...

26:50.025 --> 26:52.902
to remember someone
who is no longer with us

26:53.236 --> 26:56.364
in the way we've been used to.

26:58.825 --> 27:03.538
This person will stay
with us in many ways,

27:04.581 --> 27:06.082
(knife scraping)

27:06.750 --> 27:08.335
In our memories,

27:09.461 --> 27:11.046
in the smells,

27:11.838 --> 27:13.465
in the landscapes,

27:14.591 --> 27:17.552
in the flesh,
in the animals,

27:20.013 --> 27:22.557
in the birds that hover in the
sky,

27:23.767 --> 27:26.478
in the ants that burrow the
earth.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.481
(soft blowing)

27:29.564 --> 27:32.025
We are here together, united...

27:32.734 --> 27:34.027
(louder blowing)

27:34.611 --> 27:37.155
to continue the life cycle.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.617
(throat singing)

27:41.409 --> 27:43.495
(deep, gruff vocalizing)

27:45.997 --> 27:48.625
(fire crackling)

27:59.469 --> 28:02.305
(spitting)

28:21.241 --> 28:23.576
(man blows loudly)

28:24.744 --> 28:27.372
(boy panting)

28:28.206 --> 28:30.291
(birds chirping)

28:32.377 --> 28:33.378
Hurry.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.171
Mendel. Run.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.590
Wait up.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.883
Open your eyes.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.303
-What's that?
-It's a mini-dinosaur.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.305
(slimy crawl)

28:44.973 --> 28:46.474
(faint groans)

28:49.394 --> 28:51.688
It looks like it's laughing.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.523
(human guttural growling)

28:54.107 --> 28:58.570
It's not laughing.
It just saw you and wants to eat
you.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.906
(high-pitch ticking)

29:02.699 --> 29:04.492
(throat singing)

29:05.076 --> 29:07.120
(fire crackling)

29:08.204 --> 29:11.249
(mimicking animal sounds)

29:18.506 --> 29:21.676
(grunting)

29:27.432 --> 29:29.267
(hissing)

29:30.852 --> 29:32.437
(howling)

29:36.149 --> 29:37.984
(man barking)

29:38.943 --> 29:41.070
(animal noises)

29:50.079 --> 29:51.372
(deep rumbling)

29:52.790 --> 29:54.626
<i>Don't move.</i>

29:55.585 --> 29:58.463
(boy makes popping noise)

29:59.130 --> 30:00.840
<i>After the storm,</i>

30:00.924 --> 30:03.218
<i>the flood,</i>

30:04.928 --> 30:06.346
<i>the wind</i>

30:07.514 --> 30:09.224
<i>shakes the trees</i>

30:09.933 --> 30:11.684
(boy making whooshing noise)

30:14.229 --> 30:21.277
<i>and the muertitas</i>
<i>fall like dead leaves.</i>

30:21.778 --> 30:24.197
(boy blowing, metallic chime)

30:25.073 --> 30:26.950
<i>A few water droplets</i>

30:27.450 --> 30:29.244
<i>can erase you</i>

30:29.911 --> 30:32.330
<i>in an instant.</i>

30:34.374 --> 30:37.335
<i>Help me. Help me.</i>

30:37.919 --> 30:40.588
<i>I'm not dead.</i>

30:42.465 --> 30:44.634
<i>That's how our parents died.</i>

30:44.968 --> 30:49.013
<i>They couldn't breathe</i>
<i>that long under water.</i>

30:50.265 --> 30:52.058
(subway trundling)

30:56.062 --> 30:57.689
(brakes squealing)

31:01.901 --> 31:04.362
(ghostly voices faintly howling)

31:09.909 --> 31:11.744
(kids skateboarding)

31:20.628 --> 31:22.505
(indistinct chatter in English)

31:27.885 --> 31:29.721
(faint child scream)

31:38.646 --> 31:40.106
(soft, indistinct remarks)

31:40.189 --> 31:42.150
(scooping into plastic cup)

31:54.829 --> 31:57.874
Have you guys been faking your
laughs
at all my jokes?

31:58.541 --> 31:59.125
(laughter)

31:59.208 --> 32:00.251
You have, huh?

32:00.335 --> 32:01.878
Did you know about this?

32:01.961 --> 32:02.503
(Mendel laughs)

32:02.587 --> 32:05.548
So do you think this is a master
regulator
in a different species?

32:05.882 --> 32:09.093
Yeah, well, actually,
this is the Buckeye.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.637
optix removed...

32:11.012 --> 32:14.307
The orange is blue now.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.185
So it is evolutionarily
conserved, then?

32:17.852 --> 32:18.936
Yeah.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.481
Optix plays a role
in wing evolution.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.692
Black one's got kind of a heavy
metal vibe,
don't you think?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.987
Like rejected artwork
from In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida?

32:28.363 --> 32:29.947
(group laughter)

32:30.031 --> 32:33.159
In monarchs here, for example,
at the border,

32:33.826 --> 32:36.704
the white scales become wider.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.540
(street noise and chatter)

32:40.958 --> 32:42.960
Please help the homeless.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.803
(door opens)

32:52.178 --> 32:53.179
Santos.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.681
How are you doing?

32:54.764 --> 32:55.598
Good.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.018
How are you?

32:59.352 --> 33:02.480
-All good for now.
-That's great.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.649
Hope it stays that way.

33:05.566 --> 33:06.359
(liquid pouring in a cup)

33:08.319 --> 33:09.612
(opera-esque music)

33:13.908 --> 33:17.161
(mechanical clicking)

33:18.830 --> 33:21.874
(soft squelching, squirting)

33:31.134 --> 33:33.177
(phone ringtone)

33:39.100 --> 33:39.809
Yeah?

33:39.892 --> 33:44.188
<i>Hey, I called you like five</i>
<i>times.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

33:44.772 --> 33:47.608
Ah shit.
Time flew by, dude.

33:48.067 --> 33:51.446
<i>Well, get your ass down here.</i>
<i>We already ate but we're still</i>
<i>here.</i>

33:51.863 --> 33:57.285
<i>Lucía brought a cute friend.</i>
<i>I told her about you. She wants</i>
<i>to meet you...</i>

33:59.454 --> 34:00.663
Okay, well...

34:02.623 --> 34:05.209
Send me the details
and I'll be there soon.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.462
(woman laughing, Latin music)

34:07.920 --> 34:09.172
Thank you.

34:09.964 --> 34:10.923
Careful... careful.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.425
Coming through.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.802
Don't we look like brothers?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.721
Danish. Danish.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.473
I'm the older one.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.474
Obviously.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.517
Yeah, with the beard, you know?

34:21.601 --> 34:24.520
Do not pay attention
to those Mexican assholes.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.063
Where are you from?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.691
I'm from Michoacán,
a place called...

34:28.775 --> 34:29.859
Hot land.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.403
Yeah, it's not because of the
climate.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.323
Wait, so you are all scientists?

34:35.406 --> 34:36.407
Yes, yes.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.909
Biologists.

34:38.326 --> 34:42.288
Pablo tries to figure out
why fruit flies don't sleep,

34:43.080 --> 34:47.293
and Mendel tries to understand
why butterflies are so colorful.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.546
That sounds way sexier
than it actually is.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.842
We spend most of the time
looking through a microscope...

34:54.926 --> 34:56.719
-Yeah...
-at insects.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.387
-Just like God.
-Yeah.

34:58.888 --> 34:59.972
-Like God, you know?
-Whoa.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.224
(laughter)

35:01.682 --> 35:02.934
What about you?

35:03.017 --> 35:07.980
I work for Human Rights Watch.
Um, I'm a paralegal.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.899
-Okay.
-Mm-hm.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.401
-Anyway, let's do these tequila
shots.
-Yeah.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.820
No, no, no, but this is not
tequila.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.154
This is mezcal.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.823
It's a little bit more fancy,
you know?

35:16.906 --> 35:19.700
-Too much blah blah blah.
-And not enough gloo gloo gloo.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.662
With the left! So it repeats...

35:23.079 --> 35:28.042
-For CRISPR and the genetic
revolution!
-Genetics!

35:28.501 --> 35:29.293
(gasp in unison)

35:29.669 --> 35:31.254
No, no, no...!

35:31.587 --> 35:33.673
-Take one, take one orange.
-You sip on it.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.467
If not, you're going to get
drunk
in two minutes, okay?

35:36.551 --> 35:37.635
You kiss the mezcal.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.805
-Easy going, easy going...
-I'm fine.

35:41.138 --> 35:42.557
(chuckling)

35:43.099 --> 35:45.685
(singing in Spanish)

35:52.275 --> 35:55.319
The one who sings is Colombian

35:55.653 --> 35:57.196
and her name...

35:57.280 --> 36:00.908
her name is Maria Raquel.

36:02.201 --> 36:03.411
(Sarah laughs)

36:03.828 --> 36:06.747
Look how my people dance.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.416
(indistinct chatter)

36:08.833 --> 36:11.043
How the band plays...

36:12.628 --> 36:17.258
so we can keep having fun,
so we can keep partying

36:17.758 --> 36:20.803
till tomorrow.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.181
Get ready.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.517
(piano playing)

36:27.935 --> 36:29.687
(piano sweep)

36:30.021 --> 36:32.064
Oh no!

36:32.648 --> 36:33.983
Salsa dancers!

36:35.067 --> 36:36.736
(drum beat)

36:41.782 --> 36:44.535
And as the chorus says...

36:45.536 --> 36:47.622
Dance, dance the way Raquel
does!

36:48.205 --> 36:49.749
(laughter)

36:52.460 --> 36:53.127
Sorry!

37:00.760 --> 37:03.763
(soft, steady beeping)

37:04.764 --> 37:07.308
(machine drone)

37:20.905 --> 37:23.282
(beeping gets louder)

37:36.754 --> 37:39.048
(industrial hum, screeching
train)

37:48.432 --> 37:50.268
(door creaks open)

37:50.977 --> 37:53.020
And, ready, bend the knees.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.564
Ready, hup!

37:55.898 --> 37:58.359
There we go... back, forward,
stretch!

37:58.734 --> 38:00.778
Forward, back,
forward... good.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.989
Back, forward, stretch.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.449
Forward, back, forward.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.742
Legs behind.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.244
Little arch.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.081
This time, kick forward,
backward, forward.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.541
Good, hold it right there,

38:13.624 --> 38:15.209
push the thigh into the bar,
keep it steady.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.086
Arch, arch, arch...

38:17.169 --> 38:19.255
Good, all right,
and bring it down.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.757
Kick, forward, backward,
forward. Hup!

38:22.425 --> 38:24.719
Good, good..
all right... nice.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.512
Um, watch when you're coming
through.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.596
We got people in the air.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.724
-No street shoes inside, okay?
-Sorry.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.517
All right, Andy, you're up.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.354
I had a friend who did trapeze
for a couple of years,

38:35.730 --> 38:38.691
and one day,
I just went along with her and,

38:39.025 --> 38:40.860
I don't know,
I fell in love.

38:41.318 --> 38:43.654
-That sounds really stupid.
-No.

38:43.738 --> 38:44.530
(airplane engine hum)

38:44.905 --> 38:48.284
How would the world be like
if a human being can fly?

38:49.326 --> 38:53.080
Well, we'd definitely
all have to wear helmets

38:53.497 --> 38:54.915
all the time.

38:56.459 --> 39:00.755
And you'd have to be
a little concerned about

39:01.297 --> 39:04.300
people peeing on you.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.220
(they laugh)

39:09.513 --> 39:11.515
Yeah, some people deserve it.

39:12.266 --> 39:15.436
Yeah, I can think of a couple
people
who deserve it.

39:17.646 --> 39:22.443
And we could fly over borders.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.237
Yeah.

39:26.030 --> 39:26.947
Hm.

39:27.323 --> 39:32.328
And we could have
weird, flying pets.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.413
Like a moth.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.248
(Sarah makes a fluttering sound)

39:37.041 --> 39:37.917
(laughter)

39:38.417 --> 39:39.543
Or an owl.

39:39.919 --> 39:40.836
(Mendel hoots)

39:40.920 --> 39:42.046
Yeah.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.632
Hm.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.386
Hm...

39:50.554 --> 39:52.014
Maybe... I mean,

39:52.723 --> 39:54.767
you need to learn

39:55.476 --> 39:57.645
how to fly since your childhood,
you know?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.689
-Mm-hm.
-Like walk and talk and...

40:01.065 --> 40:01.899
Yeah.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.693
You'd have to get a license,
at some point.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.445
Pass a test.

40:08.239 --> 40:13.994
And if you broke the rules,
you'd get grounded.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.163
-Grounded?
-Yeah, like, punished.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.667
Like you wouldn't be able
to leave the ground.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.335
Hm.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.921
And then you get...

40:24.004 --> 40:28.467
you can smoke pot
to fly again.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.094
What?!

40:30.177 --> 40:32.805
You don't have to get high
to get high.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.683
(laughter)

40:40.271 --> 40:41.730
(distant rumble)

40:42.189 --> 40:43.274
(passing car whoosh)

40:43.691 --> 40:44.733
<i>Mommy, help him!</i>

40:45.192 --> 40:46.485
<i>Grab him!</i>

40:48.362 --> 40:49.405
<i>Mommy, help him!</i>

40:50.156 --> 40:51.031
<i>Grab him!</i>

40:51.615 --> 40:52.616
(distant siren)

40:53.033 --> 40:54.827
(gushing water)

40:55.286 --> 40:56.162
(violin staccato)

40:56.245 --> 40:58.998
<i>Help us. because</i>
<i>we're drowning.</i>

40:59.665 --> 41:00.583
(wind gusting, siren wailing)

41:01.083 --> 41:03.419
<i>The water is coming into our</i>
<i>houses.</i>

41:03.961 --> 41:05.129
<i>Help us.</i>

41:05.629 --> 41:10.843
<i>I am begging... for all the</i>
<i>small children...</i>
<i>For everyone here.</i>

41:13.846 --> 41:15.097
<i>(heavy breathing)</i>

41:15.556 --> 41:16.724
<i>(hollow wind)</i>

41:17.558 --> 41:21.312
<i>Mom, come!</i>
<i>Mom, please, no!</i>

41:24.064 --> 41:26.066
(water bubbling)

41:30.404 --> 41:33.782
<i>Mendel, come, climb up!</i>
<i>Water is rising!</i>

41:34.158 --> 41:34.992
<i>Hurry!</i>

41:35.075 --> 41:37.077
<i>-Let's go.</i>
<i>-Mom!</i>

41:38.037 --> 41:39.079
<i>Climb up, Mendel!</i>

41:39.705 --> 41:41.165
(fast clapping)

41:41.665 --> 41:42.583
(shriek)

41:42.666 --> 41:44.168
(shower curtain squeak)

41:45.502 --> 41:47.213
(shower running)

42:00.309 --> 42:01.393
(distorted blowing)

42:03.020 --> 42:06.774
(distorted snipping)

42:09.109 --> 42:10.778
(hollow wind)

42:13.530 --> 42:15.866
(tearing flesh)

42:21.622 --> 42:22.498
(scissor snipping)

42:26.085 --> 42:27.461
Hello, everybody, thank you.

42:27.544 --> 42:29.171
Thanks for coming tonight,

42:29.255 --> 42:30.923
thanks for coming tonight.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.383
We're going to continue
with more works

42:32.466 --> 42:33.842
around the subject of othering,

42:33.926 --> 42:35.386
as we do it to nature

42:35.469 --> 42:37.638
as much as we do it to humans.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.516
We believe that
we live in a time where

42:40.891 --> 42:44.645
social and environmental issues
can't be really treated
separately anymore.

42:44.728 --> 42:48.941
With that, I would like to
introduce you
to Lucía Barreto from Venezuela.

42:50.484 --> 42:51.402
(applause)

42:52.069 --> 42:55.072
Did you hear about
the wild cats in Texas?

42:56.282 --> 42:58.409
I don't spend my time watching
CNN.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.953
Dude, about eight of them died.

43:01.537 --> 43:05.040
They can't cross the border
because of
the highway and all the shit
there.

43:05.499 --> 43:08.544
And that asshole still wants a
wall.
What the fuck?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.587
They don't get it.

43:10.671 --> 43:14.300
They need to fuck with the
Mexican cats
to prevent inbreeding, dude.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.385
It's obvious, dude.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.555
But I do think abstraction
is very powerful,

43:19.638 --> 43:23.183
which is why
I like to perform my research.

43:23.767 --> 43:24.935
So I ask you:

43:25.436 --> 43:27.187
What does it feel like
to be a tree?

43:27.271 --> 43:29.189
Can we dream like a tree?

43:29.523 --> 43:31.775
Can we feel its pain
while it's being poisoned

43:31.859 --> 43:33.861
by acid rain?

43:42.328 --> 43:44.455
Say goodbye to the lungs of our
planet.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.498
Education, human rights...

43:46.582 --> 43:48.208
Quiet, please.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.752
Shut up, dude.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.630
(birds chirping)

43:54.214 --> 43:54.965
(animal noises)

43:55.424 --> 43:57.134
(performance music starts)

44:06.643 --> 44:08.187
(quiet wing flapping)

44:12.858 --> 44:14.651
(wings fluttering)

44:17.905 --> 44:19.406
(human groans)

44:23.660 --> 44:28.874
(distant humming and clapping)

44:33.045 --> 44:35.047
Reach out with your right hand.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.594
Here comes your bar.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.764
Now grab on
with your left hand.

44:45.891 --> 44:47.476
What the fuck am I doing here?

44:48.894 --> 44:50.187
-You got it.
-All right, Mendel.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.899
Nice and tall,
tight on the takeoff.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.943
Ready, bend your knees...

44:56.360 --> 44:57.444
Fuck it.

44:58.028 --> 44:58.821
And hup!

44:59.238 --> 44:59.905
(metal screech)

44:59.988 --> 45:03.325
Back, forward, stretch,
forward, back.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.660
Nice, nice, nice.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.578
-Back, forward.
-(net swish)

45:06.662 --> 45:08.414
-Oh!
-Yikes!

45:09.039 --> 45:10.749
That's okay, darlin'.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.209
Next!

45:12.876 --> 45:13.752
(boy blowing, woman speaking)

45:14.128 --> 45:16.213
<i>So I became interested</i>
<i>in the common Buckeye,</i>

45:16.296 --> 45:17.506
<i>Junonia coenia,</i>

45:17.589 --> 45:19.800
because in the warm months,
such as in the summer,

45:20.175 --> 45:22.469
if you rear it in warm
conditions
and long day lengths,

45:22.553 --> 45:25.055
it develops this tan color,
as we see here.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.100
But if we switch it
to cold conditions and short-day
lengths,

45:28.434 --> 45:29.476
such as in the fall,

45:29.560 --> 45:31.186
it becomes this dark red color.

45:32.187 --> 45:36.400
(music begins, distorted
howling)

45:37.151 --> 45:43.198
<i>I use CRISPR-Cas9 to modify</i>
<i>the colors of butterfly wings.</i>

45:44.825 --> 45:52.040
<i>Only a few pigment genes are</i>
<i>necessary to change</i>
<i>both color and structure of the</i>
<i>scales.</i>

45:53.292 --> 45:57.880
<i>Eliminating a control gene like</i>
<i>optix</i>
<i>explains evolution...</i>

45:58.338 --> 46:00.924
<i>explains biodiversity.</i>

46:02.926 --> 46:05.179
CRISPR is really interesting to
me,

46:05.679 --> 46:07.556
and you're using CRISPR
in your butterfly work.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.058
Yes, okay, so quick overview
to explain it.

46:10.434 --> 46:14.396
One analogy that a lot of people
use
is that of a word processor,

46:14.813 --> 46:18.859
and it gives us certain
functions
that are similar.

46:19.526 --> 46:21.612
-Stop it!
-Cut, copy, paste,

46:22.070 --> 46:23.989
and the revolution
in the technology

46:24.072 --> 46:25.073
is that it gives us a cursor,

46:25.491 --> 46:28.619
so we can pinpoint exactly
the gene we want to work on.

46:28.952 --> 46:30.871
And that has been revolutionary.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.332
It's kind of scary, frankly, to
me.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.335
You know, I mean,
I'm not anti-science,

46:36.793 --> 46:39.046
but I see the Frankenstein
future here, possibly.

46:39.546 --> 46:41.381
But I think
it's also important

46:41.757 --> 46:43.967
to talk about the potential
of the technology.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.303
But there's also the fact
that it means

46:46.637 --> 46:48.388
down the line
a generation,

46:48.472 --> 46:50.766
two generations,
ten generations later,

46:50.849 --> 46:54.228
we've turned some of us
into other creatures altogether.

46:54.686 --> 46:55.479
Doesn't that...

46:55.562 --> 46:58.106
It's a new technology, yes,
there are risks.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.609
We couldn't have left our cave
without a risk.

47:00.692 --> 47:01.109
(crowd laughter)

47:01.193 --> 47:02.444
I get that,

47:02.528 --> 47:06.406
and I get these interesting
things
you're doing with butterflies.

47:06.740 --> 47:10.410
But beyond butterflies, it gets
kind of scary,
doesn't it?

47:12.037 --> 47:13.497
So tell me.

47:13.580 --> 47:16.291
What is all the hype about
optix?

47:19.294 --> 47:22.047
It's a DNA sequence.

47:22.631 --> 47:24.132
It's a code.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.553
It controls many aspects
of the butterfly wing,

47:28.011 --> 47:33.100
like shape, color, patterns.

47:34.810 --> 47:38.230
So, if you change the sequence,

47:38.647 --> 47:40.691
then you change the color?

47:42.150 --> 47:45.946
Yeah, it may control many
aspects.

47:46.446 --> 47:47.864
You can change the color,

47:48.448 --> 47:53.787
you can appear, disappear, new
color,

47:54.204 --> 47:57.165
or make the butterfly invisible.

47:58.125 --> 48:02.588
How do you know which sequence
controls that specific color?

48:02.671 --> 48:04.381
Well, you don't really know.

48:04.464 --> 48:09.052
You just have to turn it off
and see what happens.

48:11.430 --> 48:12.639
You know,

48:13.098 --> 48:16.226
we know that your brain
controls your finger.

48:16.935 --> 48:24.151
Well, you can think of optix
as your brain, your third eye.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.820
(wind gushing)

48:27.321 --> 48:29.615
(birds chirping)

48:32.784 --> 48:33.702
Um...

48:33.785 --> 48:36.663
I see something like...
a scythe...

48:38.206 --> 48:41.251
and a person
with one foot.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.340
A tree.

48:47.924 --> 48:51.053
How about you watch
while I kill them!

48:51.386 --> 48:52.721
Fly!

48:54.389 --> 48:55.641
(light switch click)

48:57.851 --> 48:59.645
(faint sigh)

49:00.646 --> 49:02.064
(opening wooden box)

49:05.317 --> 49:06.860
(wooden box shuts)

49:09.196 --> 49:10.739
(distant car honking)

49:14.326 --> 49:16.620
-Hey, wanna go to the soccer
field in a bit?
-Yeah.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.498
-What time? Around three?
-Okay.

49:20.165 --> 49:21.750
Hey, you can't come here.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.794
What's going on?
He wants ice cream.

49:24.169 --> 49:26.338
No, he just can't be here.

49:26.421 --> 49:27.714
No, Mendel!

49:27.798 --> 49:29.675
I bet I can 'cause
I have superpowers!

49:29.758 --> 49:31.426
No, you can't go through!

49:32.260 --> 49:34.721
This is only for grown ups.
Mendel, no!

49:35.138 --> 49:37.349
You can't come!
It's forbidden.

49:39.685 --> 49:42.479
(drone, loud snipping)

49:50.278 --> 49:53.532
(fast wing flapping)

49:54.199 --> 49:55.617
(water bubbling)

49:56.868 --> 49:58.537
(distorted beep)

49:59.329 --> 50:00.872
(plucking strings)

50:01.623 --> 50:03.291
<i>Don't move.</i>

50:06.294 --> 50:07.462
(boy softly blowing)

50:10.841 --> 50:11.341
(eyelid beat)

50:11.675 --> 50:13.969
<i>This horrendous creature...</i>

50:14.511 --> 50:16.763
<i>doesn't want to grow up,</i>

50:16.847 --> 50:19.307
<i>doesn't want to grow old.</i>

50:21.893 --> 50:23.186
(splashing)

50:24.646 --> 50:28.942
<i>It doesn't know if it belongs</i>
<i>on land or in water.</i>

50:30.152 --> 50:32.320
(humans hissing in unison)

50:33.071 --> 50:35.615
<i>It stayed frozen in time.</i>

50:36.366 --> 50:37.993
(string plucking)

50:38.577 --> 50:39.536
(grunting)

50:40.620 --> 50:42.080
It's all set, buddy.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.792
Assistant Professor of Molecular
Neurobiology Lab.

50:46.209 --> 50:48.545
They gave me the job in Tucson.

50:48.962 --> 50:51.339
The mecca of Drosophila
research.

50:51.673 --> 50:53.592
They called and told me...

50:53.675 --> 50:56.428
they'd give me a start-up fund
for the next three years.

50:56.511 --> 51:01.516
Enough for a postdoc
and a few rotating PhD students.

51:02.267 --> 51:03.351
What?

51:04.644 --> 51:06.021
(lab faint chatter)

51:07.481 --> 51:11.234
That's great, man.
Congrats.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.569
(Mendel chuckles)

51:12.903 --> 51:13.695
It's great.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.573
The Tucson Fly Center is badass!

51:17.240 --> 51:18.325
(Pablo exhales)

51:18.408 --> 51:23.079
One hop and you're
on the other side eating pork
tacos.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.791
You can stop complaining
they're not good here.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.293
It's not the Yankees,
but I get the Diamondbacks.

51:28.627 --> 51:29.169
Ah?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.338
And Lucía?

51:31.421 --> 51:32.631
She's happy...

51:32.714 --> 51:36.301
but she is staying a bit longer,
to finish up a few papers.

51:36.384 --> 51:37.803
She'll join me after.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.554
And you?
What's new?

51:39.638 --> 51:44.768
All good. With Bob,
we're going to publish optix.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.687
(elevator ring, footsteps)

51:48.772 --> 51:51.024
I'm gonna miss you, brother.

51:52.692 --> 51:54.361
(Mendel slurps, swallows)

51:55.904 --> 51:56.822
And Sarah?

51:56.905 --> 51:57.697
Good?

51:59.282 --> 52:01.868
Do you get a hard-on
when you're on the trapeze?

52:04.120 --> 52:04.913
Yes or no?

52:04.996 --> 52:05.831
You're an ass.

52:06.164 --> 52:08.750
Go back to your shitty flies
and let me work, dude.

52:09.501 --> 52:10.418
(laughing)

52:10.836 --> 52:13.004
(Pablo walks away)

52:16.591 --> 52:19.177
(subway humming)

52:32.524 --> 52:34.234
(subway rattling)

52:39.948 --> 52:42.617
(distant traffic)

52:43.618 --> 52:46.079
(distant chatter)

52:48.373 --> 52:50.959
(water lapping)

52:52.294 --> 52:53.587
(faint car horns)

52:54.045 --> 52:55.672
(water crashing against rocks)

52:55.755 --> 52:57.966
(kids playing far away)

53:02.721 --> 53:06.349
(rhythmic ticking)

53:11.563 --> 53:12.647
<i>Mommy, help him!</i>

53:13.189 --> 53:14.274
<i>Grab him!</i>

53:15.066 --> 53:16.026
(water splashing)

53:16.401 --> 53:17.319
<i>Help him!</i>

53:18.278 --> 53:19.154
<i>Help him!</i>

53:21.239 --> 53:25.577
<i>Please! To everyone who can see</i>
<i>us from other states.</i>

53:25.952 --> 53:28.663
<i>Help us, because</i>
<i>we're drowning.</i>

53:31.082 --> 53:36.546
The mines were filled up with
water.

53:37.172 --> 53:39.257
And then it burst.

53:40.926 --> 53:45.555
The water was coming, coming,
and coming,

53:46.556 --> 53:49.017
in the streets,

53:49.851 --> 53:51.811
into the houses.

53:52.854 --> 53:57.192
The walls were cracking.

54:03.907 --> 54:07.285
The river was howling.

54:08.161 --> 54:09.371
(car honks)

54:09.996 --> 54:12.832
I don't really remember
what happened.

54:13.333 --> 54:17.337
Some flashes, sensations.

54:20.548 --> 54:23.343
I remember the screams.

54:24.719 --> 54:25.971
(faint drone)

54:26.388 --> 54:29.015
I lost my parents, I...

54:29.599 --> 54:32.352
lost my home.

54:35.355 --> 54:37.315
I'm so sorry.

54:37.899 --> 54:41.403
Even if we share
that horrible nightmare,

54:41.987 --> 54:43.863
my brother and I.

54:47.367 --> 54:50.912
In a way... we survived,
I mean...

54:51.830 --> 54:54.666
but in a way...

54:55.625 --> 55:01.339
the river took a part of him
away.

55:02.799 --> 55:04.676
(cars honking)

55:07.512 --> 55:11.558
And... part of me too.

55:13.351 --> 55:15.353
(distant city traffic)

55:15.937 --> 55:18.857
(city white noise)

55:22.485 --> 55:25.071
(footsteps)

55:26.656 --> 55:28.491
<i>Hi Mendel, how are you?</i>

55:29.200 --> 55:31.202
<i>It's Lupita, your sister-in-law.</i>

55:31.870 --> 55:35.331
<i>I figure you must be really busy</i>
<i>with your research</i>

55:35.415 --> 55:38.835
<i>because we haven't heard</i>
<i>from you in a while.</i>

55:40.170 --> 55:44.966
<i>I'm sending you this message</i>
<i>because</i>
<i>Gaby is getting married soon.</i>

55:45.759 --> 55:52.057
<i>We're really happy. Don Gabino</i>
<i>is even</i>
<i>remodeling the hotel for the</i>
<i>party.</i>

55:53.308 --> 55:55.977
<i>I know about your issues with</i>
<i>Simón.</i>

55:56.436 --> 56:00.523
<i>If he finds out that I reached</i>
<i>out,</i>
<i>he'll be upset.</i>

56:02.817 --> 56:04.903
<i>I hope you can make it.</i>

56:05.236 --> 56:07.781
<i>It wouldn't be the same without</i>
<i>you.</i>

56:08.448 --> 56:10.450
<i>We're family, no?</i>

56:12.952 --> 56:14.496
(Mendel softly exhales)

56:18.374 --> 56:19.793
(phone ringing)

56:30.637 --> 56:31.221
Hi, this is Pablo Quintero...

56:31.304 --> 56:33.098
Hello?
C'mon, man.

56:33.681 --> 56:35.517
Molecular Biology at the
University of Arizona.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.602
<i>You know what to do.</i>

56:39.270 --> 56:40.230
(voicemail beeps)

56:41.397 --> 56:43.191
Please call me back, bro.

56:45.985 --> 56:48.404
Congratulations.

56:48.988 --> 56:52.075
Proof for your family,
if they needed any more.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.452
(Bob exhales)

56:56.162 --> 56:59.040
One gene down, only 30,000 to
go.

57:00.834 --> 57:03.336
Now, we're gonna map the entire
wing.

57:03.878 --> 57:04.879
Yeah.

57:07.173 --> 57:08.174
(distant lab noises)

57:10.093 --> 57:11.678
That's all you got?

57:13.304 --> 57:13.930
Yeah.

57:16.057 --> 57:18.852
-Yeah...
-What's wrong?

57:20.103 --> 57:21.771
I don't wanna talk about it.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.314
Okay.

57:24.732 --> 57:26.151
(wheels chair over)

57:28.528 --> 57:30.071
All right.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.659
So, tell me.

57:35.076 --> 57:37.704
What's wrong?
You don't like the cover art?
What?

57:38.413 --> 57:39.539
No.

57:39.956 --> 57:40.999
It's okay.

57:41.332 --> 57:42.625
It's fine.

57:43.334 --> 57:45.253
It's not okay.

57:45.837 --> 57:49.215
This is what you came here to
do.

57:49.799 --> 57:51.342
And you did it.

57:51.676 --> 57:55.138
You gotta accept that and you
gotta honor it
and you gotta celebrate it.

57:57.348 --> 57:59.350
This is you.

58:02.770 --> 58:05.481
(lab equipment rattling)

58:06.649 --> 58:08.443
(distant traffic)

58:17.035 --> 58:19.871
A word to the wise.

58:20.788 --> 58:22.498
(pats shoulder)

58:23.124 --> 58:24.459
(footsteps)

58:25.126 --> 58:27.378
(test tubes spinning)

58:40.642 --> 58:41.809
(Mendel sighs)

58:42.185 --> 58:44.270
(piano music begins)

58:50.109 --> 58:52.111
(roosters crowing)

58:52.820 --> 58:54.948
(crunchy squish)

58:58.117 --> 58:59.369
(sprinkling water)

58:59.869 --> 59:01.871
Wow.
What is that?

59:01.955 --> 59:02.872
(grandma chuckles)

59:03.206 --> 59:05.917
It's called grana cochinilla.

59:09.504 --> 59:10.838
Uh-hum.

59:12.924 --> 59:15.593
-It looks like blood.
-Yes.

59:16.219 --> 59:17.804
But it's not.

59:17.887 --> 59:19.555
(amused sigh)

59:21.891 --> 59:23.559
(plastic lid clattering)

59:24.185 --> 59:26.187
(sigh)

59:28.189 --> 59:30.108
(footsteps)

59:31.317 --> 59:33.027
(heavy door clicks, screeches
open)

59:33.569 --> 59:34.946
(plastic Petri dish tapping)

59:35.446 --> 59:37.323
(wing rustling)

59:40.910 --> 59:42.578
(distant traffic)

59:43.079 --> 59:46.165
(fluttering)

59:51.504 --> 59:55.466
<i>Imagine painting</i>
<i>a butterfly with numbers.</i>

59:58.261 --> 59:59.220
(slicing)

59:59.595 --> 1:00:04.017
<i>The coloring instructions are</i>
<i>written in the genetic code.</i>

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:08.479
<i>Paint number two... red.</i>

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:10.940
<i>Paint number one... black.</i>

1:00:11.316 --> 1:00:12.191
(scraping)

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:15.778
<i>A cascade effect on color and</i>

1:00:16.195 --> 1:00:16.779
(metallic clinking)

1:00:16.863 --> 1:00:21.951
<i>The pigments and the delicate</i>
<i>butterfly scales fuse together</i>

1:00:22.410 --> 1:00:26.539
<i>creating a mosaic of colors and</i>
<i>patterns.</i>

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:31.878
<i>This helps the insect</i>
<i>hide or attract partners.</i>

1:00:34.213 --> 1:00:35.506
(liquid suction)

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:41.012
<i>Is everything okay?</i>
<i>I haven't heard from you in a</i>
<i>while.</i>

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:43.473
<i>You seem distant.</i>

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:49.812
Well, I was hoping to reach you,
but, uh, anyway...

1:00:50.188 --> 1:00:50.980
(door swings open)

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:52.148
(laughs)

1:00:52.231 --> 1:00:53.608
-This is your first tattoo,
isn't it?
-Yeah, it is.

1:00:53.691 --> 1:00:54.609
Yeah, I can tell, man.

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:57.278
Look, I'll tell you what,
why don't you look at some of my
work,

1:00:57.362 --> 1:00:58.780
And let me pull some references
up,
all right?

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:00.740
-Okay, good.
-Have a seat. Go ahead.

1:01:02.158 --> 1:01:03.910
What kind of work do you do,
man?

1:01:04.243 --> 1:01:06.162
Uh, I am scientist.

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:07.622
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:01:07.705 --> 1:01:08.790
What kind of science?

1:01:08.873 --> 1:01:10.541
-Biology.
-Biology.

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:14.629
Hey, man, did you hear that
story about, um,
what the fuck are they doing.

1:01:14.712 --> 1:01:16.589
Doing something crazy,
trying to put, like,

1:01:16.672 --> 1:01:18.424
dinosaurs with chickens or some
shit?

1:01:18.508 --> 1:01:21.010
Oh yeah, the guy from Harvard.

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:22.595
Yeah, yeah...

1:01:22.678 --> 1:01:25.431
They're trying to make
these little fuckin' chicken
raptors.

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:27.767
It's crazy, man.
You've seen Jurassic Park, no?

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:29.519
They're all gonna die, man.

1:01:29.602 --> 1:01:30.686
They're fuckin' nuts.

1:01:31.062 --> 1:01:32.188
(laughs)

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:34.732
We're gonna start from, uh,
yeah,

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:38.820
from the shoulder up
down to the wrist, okay?

1:01:40.154 --> 1:01:41.280
Okay.

1:01:41.614 --> 1:01:43.157
Just gonna take a loose
measurement.

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:47.036
Just gonna go around your
shoulder
and take it down to the wrist
just like that.

1:01:48.162 --> 1:01:50.123
(marker on crumpling tracing
paper)

1:01:53.459 --> 1:01:55.211
(cars passing by)

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.258
That'll do it.

1:02:01.008 --> 1:02:03.886
So, from there I can kind of
plot out
where we're gonna put
everything.

1:02:03.970 --> 1:02:08.015
I know it looks crazy, but we'll
size it up
and I'll be able to mock it up
for you, okay?

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:10.017
-Okay, good.
-Yeah, man.

1:02:10.476 --> 1:02:16.274
She crossed over the border
illegally
through Texas with her three
kids.

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:19.777
And, of course, they caught her
and they took her into custody.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:22.738
And then they separated her
from her kids,

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:26.576
and the kids have been in New
York City
for three weeks without their
mother.

1:02:26.659 --> 1:02:30.329
And we've been trying to talk to
them
through the social worker.

1:02:31.456 --> 1:02:33.082
How does it make you feel?

1:02:33.749 --> 1:02:35.126
Terrible.

1:02:36.919 --> 1:02:40.256
I mean, doing this job?

1:02:40.798 --> 1:02:42.633
How do you feel?

1:02:43.009 --> 1:02:44.093
(Sarah sniffles)

1:02:44.469 --> 1:02:47.763
I feel good, but that's not the
point.

1:02:50.057 --> 1:02:51.184
(Sarah inhales)

1:02:51.642 --> 1:02:53.102
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

1:02:53.186 --> 1:02:55.605
You're acting like you know
better.

1:02:56.647 --> 1:02:58.816
Actually, I know better.

1:03:00.401 --> 1:03:02.737
Yeah, of course you do.

1:03:03.571 --> 1:03:05.615
(restaurant chatter)

1:03:09.076 --> 1:03:10.828
What's going on with you?

1:03:11.454 --> 1:03:13.539
What's going on with what?

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:16.959
I haven't heard from you till
today.

1:03:17.752 --> 1:03:24.217
You showed up with this tattoo
that you didn't even tell me
about.

1:03:24.884 --> 1:03:26.719
And what's wrong with that?

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:30.348
Nothing's wrong, it's just
weird.

1:03:31.265 --> 1:03:33.518
It's not weird.

1:03:36.145 --> 1:03:38.189
Okay, it's not weird.

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:45.988
(Mendel sips, sighs)

1:03:46.864 --> 1:03:50.701
(distant piano, keys clinking)

1:03:51.536 --> 1:03:53.079
(clears throat)

1:03:58.209 --> 1:04:00.002
(door unlocking)

1:04:00.711 --> 1:04:02.463
(door creaks open)

(bubbling liquid)

1:04:39.292 --> 1:04:42.336
(faint drone)

1:04:46.799 --> 1:04:48.551
(hand hits glass)

(fast melodic chords)

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:57.476
(water lapping)

1:05:00.187 --> 1:05:02.064
(snapping twigs)

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:11.490
<i>When the monarchs arrive to Lake</i>
<i>Superior,</i>
<i>they don't cross it directly.</i>

1:05:12.950 --> 1:05:15.661
<i>They take a little detour</i>
<i>in the middle of the lake</i>

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:18.080
<i>and then they continue</i>
<i>their journey south.</i>

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:21.208
<i>As if there was something in</i>
<i>the middle. Something...</i>

1:05:21.709 --> 1:05:23.753
<i>that prevented them</i>
<i>from going further.</i>

1:05:24.128 --> 1:05:25.713
<i>An obstacle.</i>

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:31.927
<i>They say that in the middle of</i>
<i>the lake,</i>
<i>there once existed a mountain.</i>

1:05:32.553 --> 1:05:35.973
<i>One of the highest in North</i>
<i>America.</i>

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:43.731
<i>The mountain is no longer there</i>
<i>but the butterflies still</i>
<i>remember it.</i>

1:05:44.815 --> 1:05:45.900
(owl hoots)

1:05:46.233 --> 1:05:47.902
(fire crackling)

1:05:51.447 --> 1:05:54.367
(rhythm accelerates)

1:05:56.702 --> 1:05:59.163
(metal coin on rock)

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:01.874
(violin crescendo)

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:04.001

(Mendel grunts)

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:47.294
(grunting)

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:53.050
(nocturnal trilling)

1:07:14.029 --> 1:07:15.531
<i>Grandma?</i>

1:07:15.865 --> 1:07:18.117
<i>How old is the forest?</i>

1:07:20.327 --> 1:07:23.164
<i>One million years,</i>
<i>more or less.</i>

1:07:25.082 --> 1:07:26.709
(wind howling)

(liquid ejecting)

1:07:46.353 --> 1:07:47.938
(plastic tip snapping in)

1:07:52.985 --> 1:07:54.987
(chair rolls, Mendel sniffs)

1:07:55.070 --> 1:07:56.363
(string chords)

1:08:01.535 --> 1:08:03.579
(plastic cap snaps closed)

1:08:05.623 --> 1:08:08.292
<i>And how can an animal like that</i>
<i>create that color?</i>

1:08:08.709 --> 1:08:10.628
<i>Well, it's like magic.</i>

1:08:11.086 --> 1:08:16.008
<i>The grana cochinilla symbolized</i>
<i>the rays of the sun and fire.</i>

1:08:16.091 --> 1:08:16.675
(roaring fire)

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:18.928
<i>People still paint with it.</i>

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:20.930
(plastic lid drops)

1:08:22.431 --> 1:08:25.559
(latex glove stretches, Mendel
sniffs)

1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:57.550
(distant night traffic)

1:08:57.967 --> 1:09:00.427
-What'd you say you called it
again?
-Ommochrome.

1:09:00.511 --> 1:09:01.804
Ommochrome.

1:09:03.013 --> 1:09:05.975
And you're sure...
you want to put this in your
skin?

1:09:06.058 --> 1:09:08.018
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:09:08.102 --> 1:09:09.228
Okay, man.

1:09:09.645 --> 1:09:11.814
As long as you sign that waiver,
I'm down.

1:09:11.897 --> 1:09:12.481
(chuckles)

1:09:12.565 --> 1:09:18.028
You will definitely be the first
client of mine
to have butterfly ink.

1:09:19.446 --> 1:09:20.447
Ready?

1:09:20.531 --> 1:09:21.282
(tattoo gun buzzing)

1:09:21.615 --> 1:09:22.199
Yeah.

1:09:22.825 --> 1:09:24.702
Let's get some color on you.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:29.748
All right, man, let's do it.

1:09:31.584 --> 1:09:33.252
(tattoo gun buzz)

1:09:38.007 --> 1:09:39.592
It's not that bad, right?

1:09:39.675 --> 1:09:40.384
No.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:42.219
(chuckles)

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:52.521
(eerie music begins)

1:10:05.576 --> 1:10:06.535
(water gushing)

1:10:08.579 --> 1:10:10.623
(eerie melodic rumble)

1:10:12.249 --> 1:10:14.126
(swirls, hollow vacuum)

1:10:15.419 --> 1:10:17.713
(Mendel hisses)

1:10:17.796 --> 1:10:19.882
(heavy wind blowing)

1:10:22.551 --> 1:10:23.802
(crackling)

1:10:27.056 --> 1:10:28.682
(metallic chime)

1:10:29.141 --> 1:10:33.520
(whooshes of metal, water, fire
and wind)

1:10:34.188 --> 1:10:36.148
(cocoon cracks open)

1:10:39.276 --> 1:10:41.779
(scissors cutting, Mendel
panting)

1:10:44.323 --> 1:10:48.160
(creasing plastic wrap)

1:10:52.164 --> 1:10:54.083
(metal squeak)

1:11:06.512 --> 1:11:08.806
(slimy skin)

1:11:16.355 --> 1:11:18.357
(chair rolls)

1:11:22.069 --> 1:11:24.488
(fizzing liquid)

1:11:26.782 --> 1:11:28.492
(water trickling)

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.462
(water running)

1:11:42.965 --> 1:11:44.550
(Mendel sighs)

1:11:47.636 --> 1:11:49.013
(sighs again)

1:11:51.765 --> 1:11:54.518
(paper shuffling)

1:11:56.687 --> 1:11:58.564
(Mendel sips, swallows)

1:12:07.197 --> 1:12:08.782
(paper creasing)

1:12:08.866 --> 1:12:13.954
We met, danced, went for a
picnic, kissed, went north
and on December 21, 2019, we're
getting married.

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:19.251
(siren wailing)

1:12:19.585 --> 1:12:21.253
(envelope drop)

1:12:21.795 --> 1:12:23.005
(heavy sigh)

1:12:23.797 --> 1:12:26.050
(distant construction noise)

1:12:27.176 --> 1:12:28.719
(deep rumbling)

1:12:29.178 --> 1:12:31.513
(waves roaring)

1:12:33.891 --> 1:12:36.185
(soft rattling)

1:12:36.894 --> 1:12:38.937
(animal groans)

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:40.355
(fire crackling)

1:12:40.689 --> 1:12:42.733
(bubbly solution)

1:12:43.108 --> 1:12:45.944
(animal howling)

1:12:46.820 --> 1:12:49.239
(gear clinking)

1:12:50.365 --> 1:12:53.035
All right, Sarah,
tall on this take-off, all
right?

1:12:53.368 --> 1:12:54.912
Not into the bar.

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:56.330
Here we go, all right.

1:12:56.663 --> 1:12:58.207
Manny, layout.

1:12:58.582 --> 1:12:59.625
Ready.

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:01.251
Hup!

1:13:01.710 --> 1:13:02.544
Hey!

1:13:03.712 --> 1:13:07.216
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is a layout catch.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:10.844
(wind blowing)

1:13:11.512 --> 1:13:12.638
(faint city traffic)

1:13:12.721 --> 1:13:14.932
Can you see the rabbit in the
moon?

1:13:17.851 --> 1:13:18.519
Yeah.

1:13:19.144 --> 1:13:20.687
(laughter, cars passing)

1:13:20.771 --> 1:13:22.022
Do you know the legend?

1:13:22.106 --> 1:13:23.107
Mm-mm.

1:13:23.607 --> 1:13:24.817
Me neither.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.360
(laughter, wind swirls)

1:13:26.443 --> 1:13:29.404
Everybody in Mexico
can see the rabbit.

1:13:29.738 --> 1:13:32.324
And when you are a child,
people talk about it.

1:13:32.407 --> 1:13:36.995
And when I ask the people
from other parts of the world,

1:13:37.079 --> 1:13:39.331
they can't see it,
just the Mexicans.

1:13:39.414 --> 1:13:40.541
(cosmic wind swirls)

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:44.628
By the way, Mexico means
the belly button of the moon.

1:13:45.129 --> 1:13:48.298
We have a connection,
special connection with the
moon.

1:13:48.382 --> 1:13:49.800
(Sarah chuckles)

1:13:53.929 --> 1:13:55.055
(distant horn blares)

1:14:02.813 --> 1:14:03.772
(kiss)

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:10.779
(airplane humming above)

1:14:15.242 --> 1:14:18.245
(dogs barking far away)

1:14:18.954 --> 1:14:20.539
<i>A few years ago...</i>

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:27.880
<i>A storm froze about six or seven</i>
<i>million</i>
<i>butterflies in my town of</i>
<i>Angangueo.</i>

1:14:28.338 --> 1:14:29.715
<i>Many died</i>

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:33.177
<i>but a few survived like true</i>
<i>monarchs.</i>

1:14:34.219 --> 1:14:36.972
<i>The first ray of sun touched</i>
<i>them</i>

1:14:37.931 --> 1:14:39.516
<i>and they began to melt.</i>

1:14:41.018 --> 1:14:45.355
<i>We helped a few with our breath.</i>
<i>They came back to life</i>

1:14:45.898 --> 1:14:47.357
<i>and flew once again.</i>

1:14:48.817 --> 1:14:50.861
(distant dog barking)

1:14:51.612 --> 1:14:53.488
(faint music)

1:14:57.659 --> 1:14:59.870
(children playing)

1:15:03.248 --> 1:15:05.209
(leaves rustling)

1:15:06.793 --> 1:15:07.920
(distant shouting)

1:15:13.926 --> 1:15:16.094
(swooping wind)

1:15:16.178 --> 1:15:18.347
(wind chimes)

1:15:19.348 --> 1:15:27.189
What would the future
look like if we could fly?

1:15:27.773 --> 1:15:33.237
I don't know... but can you
imagine
how much intelligence we would
need to do that?

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:37.824
-Maybe by like 2023?
-Right.

1:15:38.951 --> 1:15:41.954
So how about...
when we get to grandma's...

1:15:43.455 --> 1:15:47.292
we put glasses on the table and
we shoot them with bows.

1:15:50.087 --> 1:15:51.505
(truck rumbling)

1:15:53.173 --> 1:15:55.050
(dog barking)

1:16:01.473 --> 1:16:03.684
(hurried footsteps)

1:16:04.434 --> 1:16:06.478
-Let me help you.
-Leave it!

1:16:07.104 --> 1:16:09.731
Paco, bring the rest.

1:16:09.815 --> 1:16:11.650
(steam whistle)

1:16:13.235 --> 1:16:14.152
Hi uncle.

1:16:14.653 --> 1:16:15.654
How are you?

1:16:15.737 --> 1:16:16.780
Alright.

1:16:16.863 --> 1:16:17.656
Good.

1:16:20.075 --> 1:16:20.701
(chair rattling)

1:16:21.034 --> 1:16:23.203
You know what your shirt says?

1:16:24.204 --> 1:16:25.664
Umm, no...

1:16:26.415 --> 1:16:28.041
That your feet stink.

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:29.251
(chuckles)

1:16:29.334 --> 1:16:30.711
I'm joking.

1:16:32.087 --> 1:16:34.256
How do you feel about
your sister getting married?

1:16:35.257 --> 1:16:39.177
Pretty cool.
They're moving to Toluca.

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:40.595
(Mendel snickers)

1:16:41.221 --> 1:16:43.223
You also want to go to Toluca?

1:16:43.598 --> 1:16:45.684
I want to study in Mexico City.

1:16:45.767 --> 1:16:46.852
Like you.

1:16:47.311 --> 1:16:48.854
I want to go to the Supernova.

1:16:48.937 --> 1:16:49.980
What's that?

1:16:50.522 --> 1:16:55.193
It's the best music school
in Mexico City.

1:16:56.653 --> 1:17:01.033
For me... music is a way of
being.

1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:04.328
It's another life.

1:17:05.412 --> 1:17:08.165
My dad says no.

1:17:09.041 --> 1:17:11.126
He thinks music isn't a real
career.

1:17:11.501 --> 1:17:13.420
But... I want to leave...

1:17:13.837 --> 1:17:16.506
and maybe I can drop by
to see you in New York.

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:17.466
Sure.

1:17:18.342 --> 1:17:20.093
You're always welcomed.

1:17:20.844 --> 1:17:22.095
(distant voices)

1:17:22.596 --> 1:17:24.931
You're very different from dad.

1:17:25.015 --> 1:17:26.308
How so?

1:17:27.351 --> 1:17:29.728
Well... I don't know.

1:17:30.395 --> 1:17:31.730
You just are.

1:17:32.939 --> 1:17:34.399
Look at you.

1:17:34.941 --> 1:17:36.360
(Mendel chuckles, steam whistle)

1:17:37.110 --> 1:17:39.905
When I was a kid,
I admired your dad a lot.

1:17:40.572 --> 1:17:42.157
I wanted to be like him.

1:17:43.450 --> 1:17:44.743
He was my hero.

1:17:45.118 --> 1:17:47.204
He taught me how to ride a
horse, bareback.

1:17:47.287 --> 1:17:49.081
He taught me how
to ride a bike.

1:17:49.414 --> 1:17:50.040
So?

1:17:50.415 --> 1:17:52.292
Should I bring you coffee or
what?

1:17:52.667 --> 1:17:53.752
Come on.

1:17:54.127 --> 1:17:56.588
(chair rattling)

1:17:59.841 --> 1:18:01.426
(sliding table)

1:18:07.641 --> 1:18:09.684
(sigh)

1:18:10.852 --> 1:18:13.814
Don't continue putting
ideas in his head.

1:18:14.398 --> 1:18:15.482
(table hits the floor)

1:18:15.857 --> 1:18:17.109
I didn't.

1:18:19.236 --> 1:18:20.946
Your kids want to fly, dude.

1:18:21.029 --> 1:18:22.739
That's not your problem.

1:18:25.117 --> 1:18:26.034
(neighing horse)

1:18:26.493 --> 1:18:28.036
We're from the same blood.

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:29.955
I don't want to argue.

1:18:30.038 --> 1:18:33.125
Well... things aren't that easy.

1:18:33.208 --> 1:18:37.295
No, they're not easy.
They'll never be.

1:18:38.922 --> 1:18:40.507
You don't get it.

1:18:42.968 --> 1:18:44.511
You're my brother!

1:18:45.846 --> 1:18:49.015
Mendel. I live here.

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:57.190
You weren't here when we didn't
have work,
when we didn't have enough to
feed your nephews.

1:18:57.524 --> 1:18:59.943
I spent two years without work.

1:19:03.029 --> 1:19:08.034
And you?
With your high life over there.

1:19:08.827 --> 1:19:13.206
You don't even have the balls to
have
your own family. Now you come,
judge.

1:19:14.791 --> 1:19:17.085
I stayed! You left.

1:19:26.178 --> 1:19:28.013
(Mendel whimpers)

1:19:28.513 --> 1:19:31.475
I left with all the demons
that you put inside me.

1:19:31.558 --> 1:19:32.851
And me!?

1:19:33.477 --> 1:19:36.104
I stayed in the house
where it all happened!

1:19:39.774 --> 1:19:42.986
I don't even remember
what happened that night!

1:19:45.238 --> 1:19:50.076
All my memories are the ones
you put in my head.

1:19:54.789 --> 1:19:57.209
(breathes heavily)

1:20:03.548 --> 1:20:05.509
(exhales slowly)

1:20:06.092 --> 1:20:08.386
The mine filled up with water.

1:20:09.679 --> 1:20:11.640
That shit exploded.

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:15.060
A ton of people died, dude.

1:20:18.647 --> 1:20:22.317
And you still go to that shitty
place
to work every day. Come on,
man...

1:20:22.734 --> 1:20:24.319
Don't fuck with me!

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:29.574
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

1:20:30.492 --> 1:20:33.787
(heavy sighs)

1:20:36.248 --> 1:20:37.290
(swallows)

1:20:37.707 --> 1:20:40.126
Good that you can't remember
'cause I do.

1:20:42.879 --> 1:20:44.881
I saved you.

1:20:46.049 --> 1:20:48.009
You were drowning
in your room.

1:20:48.093 --> 1:20:49.678
I managed to get in.

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:54.432
I took you upstairs.
And I didn't let go of you all
night

1:20:54.516 --> 1:20:58.728
while the water kept rising.

1:21:07.279 --> 1:21:09.573
(Mendel cries softly)

1:21:11.241 --> 1:21:12.576
Why didn't you ever tell me?

1:21:12.951 --> 1:21:14.452
Because you don't get it!

1:21:14.536 --> 1:21:16.871
'Cause you don't live here.

1:21:18.164 --> 1:21:20.292
(footsteps approaching)

1:21:22.002 --> 1:21:22.669
(Mendel sniffs)

1:21:22.752 --> 1:21:24.588
What's going on here?

1:21:25.046 --> 1:21:25.880
Nothing, uncle.

1:21:25.964 --> 1:21:28.884
The tables.
The tablecloths are ready.

1:21:29.843 --> 1:21:32.012
(distant fanfare)

1:21:33.221 --> 1:21:36.349
Let's hurry 'cause it's getting
late.

1:21:38.018 --> 1:21:39.477
Thank you.

1:21:45.233 --> 1:21:46.943
(footsteps)

1:21:47.402 --> 1:21:49.112
(amplified town announcement)

1:21:49.571 --> 1:21:51.656
No, well, you aimed high.

1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:53.658
Not like my people.

1:21:54.409 --> 1:21:58.288
Did you find a cure for death?

1:21:58.830 --> 1:21:59.664
I'm on it.

1:21:59.998 --> 1:22:02.626
Or rather the origin of life, my
son.

1:22:02.709 --> 1:22:04.210
That's the idea.

1:22:04.586 --> 1:22:06.755
But he's not finding anything.

1:22:07.088 --> 1:22:07.589
(laughter)

1:22:07.672 --> 1:22:11.509
Well, he's following his
father's dreams
to make the world a better
place.

1:22:11.593 --> 1:22:12.385
Right?

1:22:12.469 --> 1:22:16.514
My uncle told me you had
a revelation, madrina.

1:22:16.598 --> 1:22:19.643
Ah! You're going to laugh at me.
Why do you...

1:22:20.393 --> 1:22:22.437
Wait and see.
Look.

1:22:22.812 --> 1:22:25.815
All this time seeing
this magazine in the kiosk

1:22:25.899 --> 1:22:27.734
until I decided to buy it.

1:22:27.817 --> 1:22:29.694
Look what it says here.

1:22:29.778 --> 1:22:30.987
Just look.

1:22:31.071 --> 1:22:31.821
(faint town bustle)

1:22:31.905 --> 1:22:36.368
That name of yours finally makes
sense.

1:22:36.451 --> 1:22:39.704
-My namesake.
-I understand why your dad
insisted so much.

1:22:39.788 --> 1:22:41.831
This scientist...

1:22:41.915 --> 1:22:42.874
of genetics.

1:22:42.957 --> 1:22:44.376
And the articles are good.

1:22:44.459 --> 1:22:46.127
The name always seemed
so strange to me.

1:22:46.211 --> 1:22:48.880
But when you were a boy
I never dared to ask.

1:22:48.963 --> 1:22:50.548
I learned a lot of things...

1:22:50.632 --> 1:22:53.843
Right here.
About life... and death.

1:22:53.927 --> 1:22:54.969
Look.

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:57.305
(butterflies fluttering)

1:22:58.515 --> 1:23:00.517
(birds chirping)

1:23:01.434 --> 1:23:06.940
The legend says that a nagual
is your soulmate, is your animal
spirit.

1:23:07.399 --> 1:23:07.982
Mm.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:13.905
And some people can transform
themselves
into the animal,

1:23:14.322 --> 1:23:17.409
like dogs or cats or whatever.

1:23:18.284 --> 1:23:21.996
And when I was a child,
I pretend to be an animal, a
bear.

1:23:22.330 --> 1:23:24.666
-A bear?
-My friend, Vicente,

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.210
pretended to be a lion.

1:23:27.585 --> 1:23:31.131
And we'd play here in this
forest.

1:23:31.673 --> 1:23:32.549
(footsteps on dirt road)

1:23:32.632 --> 1:23:34.759
Chasing each other.

1:23:35.301 --> 1:23:37.512
Ruling the land.

1:23:37.595 --> 1:23:40.807
So, are you like lord of all
this land?

1:23:40.890 --> 1:23:42.016
Yes, I am.

1:23:42.392 --> 1:23:44.602
-Hot land
-I'm the lord of this.

1:23:44.978 --> 1:23:45.562
Yeah.

1:23:45.937 --> 1:23:46.730
(laughing)

1:23:47.647 --> 1:23:49.357
(birds chirping, wing flutter)

1:23:50.024 --> 1:23:52.318
Thank you for bringing me here.

1:23:52.402 --> 1:23:53.862
Thank you for coming.

1:23:58.950 --> 1:24:00.118
(kiss)

1:24:03.329 --> 1:24:06.791
They say that
in the Day of the Dead in
Mexico,

1:24:07.417 --> 1:24:11.421
the butterflies arrive
to Angangueo

1:24:11.796 --> 1:24:16.092
and they are the soul
of our relatives.

1:24:17.510 --> 1:24:19.888
(children playing, folklore
music)

1:24:20.513 --> 1:24:22.557
(crowd cheering)

1:24:31.316 --> 1:24:33.943
Kiss! Kiss!

1:24:34.861 --> 1:24:36.696
(chanting continues)

1:24:40.658 --> 1:24:43.912
(trio band playing, singing)

1:24:45.747 --> 1:24:48.082
One more! One more!

1:24:49.501 --> 1:24:51.669
(clapping)

1:24:52.253 --> 1:24:56.299
(faint reverberating cacophony)

1:24:58.343 --> 1:25:00.804
The animals are stronger than
humans.

1:25:01.137 --> 1:25:04.557
I prefer being a lion 'cause
they're stronger and smarter--

1:25:04.641 --> 1:25:06.768
Shhh...
Vicente, they're coming.

1:25:06.851 --> 1:25:08.061
(chatter echo, singing)

1:25:08.144 --> 1:25:10.313
Wolf, wolf...
Are you there?

1:25:10.855 --> 1:25:12.565
(shouting)

1:25:12.899 --> 1:25:16.277
(Mexican folklore music)

1:25:20.406 --> 1:25:23.827
(kids laughing, playing)

1:25:33.545 --> 1:25:34.879
(roaring)

1:25:35.338 --> 1:25:37.340
(growling)

1:25:38.341 --> 1:25:42.470
(crowd applause)

1:25:45.390 --> 1:25:47.225
(rooster crowing)

1:25:47.559 --> 1:25:48.810
Tell me, doctor...

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:55.149
What would happen if you combine
human and animal genes?

1:25:55.650 --> 1:25:57.944
And why would we do that?

1:25:58.027 --> 1:25:58.945
(Mendel laughs)

1:25:59.028 --> 1:26:00.655
Why do you want to know?

1:26:01.197 --> 1:26:03.116
I'm interested in my DNA.

1:26:03.199 --> 1:26:05.493
The other day, I spit into a
tube...

1:26:05.910 --> 1:26:08.955
to know the percentage of
Neanderthal in me.

1:26:09.581 --> 1:26:12.625
The average is 2.7%.

1:26:13.042 --> 1:26:14.752
I have 2.6%.

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:17.964
I would have guessed at least
8%.

1:26:18.423 --> 1:26:19.674
(laughs)

1:26:21.134 --> 1:26:23.970
(drawer opens, keys jangle)

1:26:27.473 --> 1:26:31.644
(footsteps on dried leaves)

1:26:39.569 --> 1:26:41.404
(distant swirling wind)

1:26:42.030 --> 1:26:44.741
Dust we are...

1:26:45.575 --> 1:26:47.869
and to dust we shall return.

1:26:49.621 --> 1:26:51.539
(Vicente sighs)

1:26:51.956 --> 1:26:53.291
(deep rumbling)

1:26:53.791 --> 1:26:56.502
(owl hooting, wind howls)

1:26:57.211 --> 1:27:00.798
(dusk creature orchestra)

1:27:01.758 --> 1:27:02.717
(coin tapping)

1:27:03.134 --> 1:27:04.844
(fire crackling)

1:27:22.946 --> 1:27:24.739
(owl hooting)

1:27:25.698 --> 1:27:27.825
(rhythmic strings chords)

1:27:37.919 --> 1:27:40.296
(nocturnal animals)

1:28:01.609 --> 1:28:05.738
<i>Thousands of years ago,</i>
<i>the Native American Indians</i>
<i>decided to travel south.</i>

1:28:06.823 --> 1:28:09.367
<i>The journey was very long and</i>
<i>tiresome.</i>

1:28:10.034 --> 1:28:12.036
<i>There was a lot of suffering.</i>

1:28:12.662 --> 1:28:16.165
<i>So they decided to leave behind</i>
<i>the elders and the children</i>

1:28:16.582 --> 1:28:19.502
<i>next to a few trees</i>
<i>that would protect them.</i>

1:28:20.295 --> 1:28:22.130
<i>They were very sad</i>

1:28:22.588 --> 1:28:25.383
<i>so God came closer to console</i>
<i>them.</i>

1:28:25.842 --> 1:28:27.510
<i>"Don't cry anymore."</i>

1:28:28.219 --> 1:28:34.934
<i>He turned them into butterflies</i>
<i>so they could join</i>
<i>their families, who were waiting</i>
<i>for them with open arms.</i>

1:28:38.896 --> 1:28:41.274
(agitated bird and other
creatures)

1:28:52.243 --> 1:28:53.244
(woman exhales)

1:28:53.327 --> 1:28:54.787
(human and animal sounds)

1:28:54.871 --> 1:28:56.497
(jaguar roars)

1:28:58.791 --> 1:29:00.251
(wings fluttering)

1:29:00.835 --> 1:29:02.879
