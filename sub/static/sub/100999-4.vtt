WEBVTT

00:00.070 --> 00:01.150
Previously on Condor...

00:01.190 --> 00:05.170
You said they took him. But they didn't kill him...
-I don't know.

00:05.210 --> 00:10.100
- What happens?
- We need a lie detector test.

00:10.140 --> 00:16.000
What would you do
if Vasily Sirin contacted you?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.120
Obey your orders.

00:19.110 --> 00:24.080
Sammy's got a lot of anger against Reuel Abbott.
He thinks he was involved with his father's death.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.210
I don't want it to be something that can just wash away
and grow back. I want it to be permanent.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.110
You here to volunteer?

00:30.150 --> 00:32.240
I haven't seen you around before.
- My first time.

00:33.001 --> 00:35.501
If I give you my number, will you call me?
- Absolutely.

00:36.030 --> 00:40.110
- Why were you watching Piper?
- There's a file on Gordon in Bob Partridge's home office.

00:40.150 --> 00:44.220
He has an alarm system.
We'll give you something to spray on the keypad at brunch.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.910
- I'm not doing anything.
- I told you everything that I know.

00:48.010 --> 00:51.810
You know why I think you'll do it?
You have a hard time walking away from a fight.

00:52.090 --> 00:58.220
At some point a man in this job learns it's all
just a chess match. - Fuck the Agency!

00:59.010 --> 01:02.110
So, what did you learn?
- He's erratic. He's emotional. He's bad with money.

01:02.150 --> 01:07.050
He's the perfect candidate for recruitment
by a foreign power. -Thank you.

01:07.090 --> 01:11.140
Door's open.
Ìf you ever wanna feel useful.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.100
How was the drink?

02:57.110 --> 03:02.060
You know that sailors call the ocean 'the drink'?
- That and bourbon.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.400
- Gordon always did like his booze.

03:04.563 --> 03:08.526
Hey, I just saw Sammy riding his bike.
Where's he off to so late?

03:10.050 --> 03:14.000
I don't know. He's 17.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.030
Why are you spending so much time with Gordon?

03:22.140 --> 03:27.060
I like him. He's a nice guy.
- I know you too well to believe that.

03:28.180 --> 03:31.124
What other reason would I have for 
wanting to spend time with him?

03:31.243 --> 03:32.485
That's my original question

03:33.240 --> 03:37.110
You're being paranoid.
- I'm feeling paranoid.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.210
Sitting here replaying things in my mind.
- What things?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.041
Like this morning you said you were 
coming to church with us

03:43.405 --> 03:46.401
and then afterwards you got us invited 
for brunch at Eva and Gordon's

03:46.440 --> 03:50.490
He invited us. - The car accident that you got 
into on your way home from the airport.

03:50.530 --> 03:54.360
You missing Bob's funeral
because you hit your head.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.300
Either of those things on their own wouldn't 
mean much but when you put them together ...

03:59.220 --> 04:02.080
Do you remember how bad you used to 
feel when you worked for the CIA

04:02.080 --> 04:04.947
and you couldn't tell anybody what you did?

04:05.170 --> 04:07.220
I'm not in the CIA.

04:08.010 --> 04:10.160
Remember how much you 
used to hate lying?

04:10.160 --> 04:11.680
I still hate lying.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.149
Then I guess I'm just being paranoid. 
Good night.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.120
Mae...

04:30.020 --> 04:36.200
After Bob died I was asked to step in to 
help an asset of his that was in trouble.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.030
It was temporary.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.140
That's why I ... came home.

04:47.150 --> 04:50.000
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you the truth.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.070
And what about Gordon? Are you 
working with him? - No.

04:54.170 --> 05:00.030
So you're not back with the Agency?
- Like I said, it was temporary.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.060
For someone that hates lying,
you're very good at it, Joe.

05:06.060 --> 05:10.230
Maybe you're so good at it you 
can lie to yourself. Good night.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.060
Hello?
- Who is it?

06:08.100 --> 06:13.000
It's Reuel Abbott, from earlier today.
- The CIA man.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.641
I was hoping you'd call. 
I wasn't expecting it to be so soon.

06:15.741 --> 06:19.883
Well, I was actually planning on 
waiting, but... you know...

06:20.050 --> 06:25.070
Waiting is a young person's game.
How are things over at the CIA?

06:25.110 --> 06:28.200
I think I should probably tell you that
I really do work for the CIA.

06:29.130 --> 06:30.482
You are the Deputy Director.

06:30.482 --> 06:34.962
You're also the most famous person named Reuel 
on the internet. I googled you on my break.

06:35.050 --> 06:38.800
I hope you haven't read too much of what 
the internet has to say about me.

06:38.802 --> 06:41.523
Because it's not great.

06:41.685 --> 06:43.721
Let's face it, the internet has gotten out of control.

06:44.140 --> 06:48.240
I mean, I can't look away but if I took any 
of it too seriously I'd never leave my house.

06:49.030 --> 06:53.150
Well, you know, all of human 
kind's best tools are really like that.

06:53.190 --> 06:56.163
Double edged sword. Fire cooks our 
food and heats our homes

06:56.163 --> 06:59.046
and at the same time engulfs 
entire cities in flames.

07:00.110 --> 07:03.020
Is everyone at the CIA as philosophical as you?

07:03.060 --> 07:07.160
James Angleton was a poet.
He was a close friends with Ezra Pound.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.150
Pound was a fascist.
- Nobody's perfect.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.140
Who shot you?

07:29.060 --> 07:33.200
- Do you call yourself "Cat" now?
- Did you mess up my stuff?

07:44.030 --> 07:47.220
Americans
can't say Yekaterina.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Do you let it sit?

07:54.160 --> 07:59.090
It's too dangerous to take it out.
Then the artery may burst.

08:00.080 --> 08:05.230
Sasha got lead poisoning from a bullet
several years after he was shot.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.190
What are you trying to say?

08:11.090 --> 08:17.000
I had nowhere to go.
They were going to kill me.

08:17.150 --> 08:20.020
Now they will kill both of us.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.200
So.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.150
Get up.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.220
There is menswear there.

08:55.070 --> 08:59.140
Katja ... Do you have a girlfriend?

08:59.180 --> 09:01.040
Now get dressed.

09:29.150 --> 09:32.442
What the fuck do you tell yourself 
that you do for a living?

09:32.442 --> 09:35.082
The most that any one person 
can do morality-wise

09:35.100 --> 09:38.220
is to have his own tribe of people 
that he'd be willing to die for.

10:09.190 --> 10:14.040
- We have the same size.
- He was bigger.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.240
There's $10,000 and a gun.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.030
Are you abandoning me?

10:23.070 --> 10:30.030
I arranged your leg and gave you
my escape bag. That must be enough.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.140
Police! Hands up!

11:14.684 --> 11:16.562
Don't you fucking move!
Where's your wife?

11:16.842 --> 11:20.040
My wife? - Who else is in the house?
My wife is dead.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.120
Where's the body? Where is she?

11:22.160 --> 11:27.190
Buried in Rock Creek cemetery. She's been dead for 
two years. What the hell are you doing in my house?

11:41.050 --> 11:42.220
Excuse me.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.100
Mr. Abbott?

11:52.110 --> 11:54.230
Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

11:55.020 --> 11:58.180
Tell me what you heard?
- You were 'swatted'.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.040
Like a fly?
- It's a harassment tactic.

12:02.045 --> 12:05.482
Someone called 911 and said 
they were hiding in your closet

12:05.482 --> 12:07.881
while you were holding 
your wife at gunpoint.

12:07.925 --> 12:12.935
Can you hold it back down there please for a minute.
We're talking. Thank you.

12:12.975 --> 12:17.121
And they didn't even think to look into my 
marital status or my wife's earthly status...

12:17.121 --> 12:18.522
before kicking down my door?

12:18.725 --> 12:21.905
Swatting's a new phenomenom.
They're still figuring out how to deal with it.

12:22.043 --> 12:22.871
Clearly.

12:22.895 --> 12:26.095
The CIMC thinks that it could have been 
the Russians or North Koreans.

12:27.105 --> 12:29.895
But you don't think so.

12:31.005 --> 12:34.642
No. This feels personal.

12:35.042 --> 12:37.282
You would even say childish.

12:37.945 --> 12:39.105
Sammy!

12:43.065 --> 12:44.935
Sammy!

12:44.975 --> 12:49.035
All right. Just hold here...
OK.

12:49.075 --> 12:51.644
- Hey. I'm seeing a lot of you lately.

12:51.644 --> 12:53.724
Morning pal.
-Morning.

12:54.042 --> 12:55.747
Just getting patched up here.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.025
Sammy! You're gonna be late.

12:58.085 --> 12:59.965
How're you feeling?

13:00.955 --> 13:04.664
We did a little drinking last night.
- I heard.

13:04.762 --> 13:07.080
I'm sure Eva loved you coming home plastered.

13:07.125 --> 13:13.015
Well... we made up.
- Don't be gross. There's a child sitting here.

13:13.055 --> 13:17.055
No, you misunderstand.
What I was saying was, we had sex.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.945
Sammy!

13:20.985 --> 13:24.000
All rights. Gord's good to go.
- Good as new.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.403
Thank you. - You're welcome.
- See you later.

13:27.985 --> 13:31.945
What are you doing today?
- I don't know. Nursing this hangover you gave me.

13:31.985 --> 13:36.081
Don't blame me. Each man's hangover 
is his own responsibility. - True enough!

13:36.081 --> 13:37.324
See you later!
- Bye!

13:43.915 --> 13:48.295
I'm sorry about last night.
- Yeah, me too.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.915
Good morning. - Good morning
You can have a bowl of cereal.

13:52.955 --> 13:55.005
I'm not hungry.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.025
Are you feeling all right?

13:59.115 --> 14:01.842
Why do you smell like alcohol?

14:01.842 --> 14:06.003
Oh my God! Have you been drinking?

14:07.135 --> 14:09.105
Who were you drinking with?

14:10.115 --> 14:12.005
Nobody.

14:12.045 --> 14:18.115
You got drunk by yourself?
What, does this happen a lot? Why?!

14:18.905 --> 14:21.125
I don't know.
- Go to your room!

14:23.075 --> 14:24.975
And hydrate.

15:02.955 --> 15:05.065
Hey.
- Hi, Lily. How you doing?

15:05.105 --> 15:09.105
You know. 
As well as can be expected.

15:09.895 --> 15:14.055
Shall we have dinner or something?
- I'd love that.

15:23.095 --> 15:25.115
How's your hand, idiot?

15:25.905 --> 15:30.045
Sorry, not you.
You said in your message there was a problem.

15:33.115 --> 15:35.075
Are you sure?

15:36.965 --> 15:41.945
I'm gonna have to call you back. Thank you.

15:47.935 --> 15:49.995
What did I do?

15:50.035 --> 15:54.075
I signed up for Meal Train for Lily.
I was having food delivered today.

15:54.115 --> 15:58.965
And the restaurant just called to tell 
me that our Visa got declined.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.803
How is that even possible?
I just paid it.

16:01.803 --> 16:02.923
Yeah, I meant to tell you about that.

16:02.985 --> 16:07.125
I got stuck with the bill
at dinner last Monday.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.895
Is it a stupid question to ask why?

16:09.935 --> 16:12.725
Well, we can't split the bill nine ways 
so we played credit card roulette.

16:12.725 --> 16:14.801
I had a bad run of luck.

16:14.801 --> 16:17.905
Run?
- Last two.

16:17.945 --> 16:21.123
Maybe you just can't afford to 
go to this dinner any more.

16:21.123 --> 16:24.003
It's business. It'll all even out
over 162 games.

16:24.025 --> 16:28.035
What the fuck does that even mean?
- Use the Mastercard. It's still good.

16:31.955 --> 16:38.095
Hi, this is Eva Piper again.
I'm so sorry, our Visa got stolen.

16:38.975 --> 16:42.905
Do you still have my other 
card on file? Thanks.

16:42.945 --> 16:46.995
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:55.065 --> 16:58.922
So the caravan is coming to look
at the house on Tuesday.

16:58.922 --> 17:01.841
The caravan? With a bunch of camels?

17:01.895 --> 17:05.125
Real estate agents. I'm gonna need 
a few hours in the morning to...

17:05.915 --> 17:12.125
Real estate agents? Why?
- Gordon we are about to run out of money.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.202
We're not selling this house.

17:14.202 --> 17:16.644
We have been though this.
If we don't sell the house...

17:16.645 --> 17:19.160
I'll get the money.
- How?

17:19.324 --> 17:26.895
I'll figure it out.
Ye gods honey, your optimism...

17:26.935 --> 17:30.985
Hey, pull up a chair.
Breakfast at the Pipers.

17:31.025 --> 17:33.121
I didn't realise you were such a voyeur.

17:33.121 --> 17:36.941
I'm divorced. I haven't had a life,
so this is my entertainment.

17:36.945 --> 17:39.081
You didn't have a life when 
you were married either.

17:41.945 --> 17:45.080
Lucky for you, I'm not afraid 
of a little self-knowledge.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.564
Not like your friend over here,
'cos he is a fucking mess.

17:48.915 --> 17:51.935
Cruller? - I would have thought a cop would be more 
sensitive about eating donuts in front of people.

17:52.925 --> 17:56.035
Fuck you.
I'm the head of counter-espionage.

17:56.075 --> 18:01.115
You're an FBI agent stationed inside 
the CIA. For us, you're just a cop.

18:01.905 --> 18:05.025
I am sensing some hostility 
from you this morning.

18:06.995 --> 18:08.120
What have I missed?

18:08.120 --> 18:11.081
They fight, they fuck, they fight, they fuck...

18:11.095 --> 18:13.241
Some couples just run hot.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.842
Maybe you're too close to them.
Maybe you should recuse yourself.

18:17.975 --> 18:19.589
I just want to get to the truth.

18:19.589 --> 18:22.042
And and you want the truth to be 
that your friend is innocent.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.407
That's because I believe that that is the truth
- Based on what?

18:25.407 --> 18:27.442
Based on years of friendship.

18:27.915 --> 18:34.115
You say that as if it's an advantage
when it is so clearly a weakness.

18:34.945 --> 18:37.975
We've got Gordon from two separate sources.

18:38.015 --> 18:42.115
One who's dead and the other is inside 
Russian intelligence known only to you.

18:42.905 --> 18:47.005
Is that what this is about? - that
I have not shared my source with you?

18:48.985 --> 18:53.035
Can't rate the intel if I can't judge the source.
And how do you expect me to trust that?

18:53.075 --> 18:58.945
I expect you to trust me.
And I trust the source.

19:03.015 --> 19:06.005
Did you ever think that maybe the 
Russians are setting Gordon up?

19:07.895 --> 19:10.895
Gordon fits the mold of a double agent.

19:10.935 --> 19:14.985
Career stalled out, money 
problems, marital problems ...

19:15.025 --> 19:19.035
And probably a bunch of other fucking problems
that science hasn't even discovered yet.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.025
Which is exactly why they 
would set him up.

19:22.065 --> 19:26.985
Or maybe that's why he was 
approached in the first place.

19:27.915 --> 19:32.055
Maybe you were the one that was approached.
- Me?

19:32.095 --> 19:34.985
You got Gordon served to 
you on a silver platter

19:35.025 --> 19:39.945
by a single source inside the SVR
whose identity is known only to you.

19:43.995 --> 19:50.065
You can't tell me that you're not predisposed to 
suspect a man who appears to be living a double life.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.945
Fuck you.

19:52.945 --> 19:58.915
We've all got weakness. As long as we 
understand it as well as our enemy does.

20:01.005 --> 20:03.995
Bring up the laundry room.
- Stand by.

20:08.045 --> 20:09.806
Are we getting this?

20:09.806 --> 20:12.000
We don't have that phone.

20:12.915 --> 20:14.965
It must be a burner.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.323
Hey, it's me.  Listen, I'm gonna need 
an advance on our arrangement.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.720
I'll make it up to you.

20:22.882 --> 20:25.362
I wouldn't be asking if I didn't.

20:28.065 --> 20:29.895
Great.

20:36.915 --> 20:40.995
- Are you still here?
- You look nice.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.975
You don't love me anymore.

21:04.945 --> 21:09.015
You were my superior. You had
power over me. Is it love?

21:09.055 --> 21:14.005
You've been with Americans for
so long that you think like them.

21:14.995 --> 21:21.135
I was there, Katja. I loved
you very much and you loved me.

21:22.955 --> 21:25.065
Don't take it from me.

21:28.075 --> 21:34.995
I have to say you came. I'm saying
you threatened me with a gun.

21:35.035 --> 21:40.135
You also have to tie me up.
Use your brain! People are looking for you.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.025
I can't handle
more lie detectors.

21:44.065 --> 21:46.915
We are a threat to each other.

21:47.105 --> 21:49.125
So let's help each other.

21:58.075 --> 22:00.985
The dead cannot help the living.

22:02.105 --> 22:05.135
Admit that you want to stay here.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.955
I'm going home
after completing the mission.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.045
I do not believe you.

22:12.095 --> 22:16.035
I've been looking at your stuff.
You thrive here.

22:17.935 --> 22:22.105
Is that your persuasion tactic?
"Help me so you can stay in the United States."

22:22.895 --> 22:27.025
- You wanted to get rich.
- And chased the rest of my life.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.965
People are coming soon.

22:40.895 --> 22:46.915
- Then you send me to my death.
- No, you did it yourself.

22:53.085 --> 22:57.015
Hey. How are you feeling?

22:58.055 --> 23:01.125
I'm not feeling so great this morning either.

23:02.125 --> 23:07.105
I know you told my Mom that you 
were gonna look after me today

23:07.895 --> 23:11.995
but I'm 17 and I don't need a babysitter.

23:16.965 --> 23:22.915
You know, by the time I was 17, I had already 
been away from home for three years.

23:23.965 --> 23:26.125
What?
- Boarding school.

23:26.915 --> 23:29.895
Hey, you ever try
your dad's hangover cure?

23:30.015 --> 23:34.045
It tastes like shit,
but it works.

23:36.935 --> 23:39.005
Go on, try it, it will make 
youl feel better.

23:46.095 --> 23:48.065
You forgot the mustard.
- That's it!

23:56.995 --> 24:00.035
Sorry.
- It's just mustard.

24:08.895 --> 24:11.095
I guess when you do the kind 
of shit that my dad did

24:11.135 --> 24:15.045
you need a pretty reliable hangover cure.

24:18.035 --> 24:23.965
Sammy there's something I want to show you.
- Maybe some other time. Thanks.

24:24.005 --> 24:27.115
I want to tell you about the day your dad died.

25:00.945 --> 25:07.075
Vasily Sirin has jumped off.
He left Vienna and traveled here.

25:07.115 --> 25:09.025
I thought so.

25:09.065 --> 25:15.895
He knows who Volk's double agent
in the CIA is, and has sold the information.

25:15.935 --> 25:19.995
We tried to arrest him,
but he escaped.

26:05.015 --> 26:08.945
- Where are we going?
- I have an errand.

26:15.005 --> 26:17.565
Your dad was the best 
friend that I ever had.

26:18.484 --> 26:21.525
and he proved it to me right there.

26:23.995 --> 26:25.985
Get in!

26:27.085 --> 26:32.055
If he had been one a second later,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

26:34.025 --> 26:37.095
He traded his life for mine, Sammy.

26:45.065 --> 26:47.945
That's a debt that I can't repay.

26:48.085 --> 26:54.105
All I can do is look after his family.
Which is what he would have wanted.

26:54.895 --> 26:59.005
Maybe. Or maybe you 
didn't know him at all.

27:00.955 --> 27:04.095
I knew him.
- Even after knowing what he tried to do?

27:04.135 --> 27:11.035
Yeah. And I judge him 
for it too, Sammy.

27:11.095 --> 27:14.035
But after the things that I did...

27:14.925 --> 27:16.005
No!

27:20.055 --> 27:22.055
What kind of things?

27:26.905 --> 27:32.065
After your dad was killed, I went to 
the home of this woman, Kathy Hale.

27:34.005 --> 27:37.955
To protect myself I had 
to forcibly restrain her.

27:41.065 --> 27:43.005
She was killed...

27:46.075 --> 27:47.995
...because of me.

27:53.055 --> 27:56.045
All we can do is wrestle with our demons.

27:59.895 --> 28:03.985
And hope that we win 
more often than we lose.

28:19.935 --> 28:22.403
I sent a SWAT team to Reuel Abbott's house.

28:23.043 --> 28:26.562
What?
- Last night.

28:27.985 --> 28:30.901
Sammy, they're gonna trace it back to...
- No, I was careful.

28:30.901 --> 28:34.101
I bought a burner with cash at a 
place where they don't ask for ID.

28:34.115 --> 28:36.995
And I got rid of the phone.

28:41.065 --> 28:44.975
I've been thinking I should turn myself in.
-No, no, no.

28:48.015 --> 28:53.115
If I don't take responsibility,
then how am I any different from him?

28:53.905 --> 28:56.975
Sammy, you're nothing like Reuel Abbott!

28:58.935 --> 29:00.095
I meant my dad.

29:08.135 --> 29:14.925
Don't let one mistake ruin your life.
Instead, learn from it.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.095
Don't be so stupid again.

29:21.935 --> 29:27.005
I would have loved to see the look on the sonofabitch's 
face when the SWAT team came through the door.

29:35.095 --> 29:37.095
Are you going to stay?

29:43.125 --> 29:49.985
You know, maybe... I haven't 
really been honest with...

29:50.025 --> 29:53.955
...anybody about why 
I came back here.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.895
Why did you come back?

29:59.975 --> 30:02.045
I'm still figuring that out.

30:14.025 --> 30:15.935
7–4–8–0.

30:34.015 --> 30:37.975
Hey. Where have you been all day?

30:38.015 --> 30:41.075
I've been dealing with some things onsite.
Let's get dinner.

30:41.115 --> 30:45.085
I can't, I got a business dinner.
- Fuck it. Move it. Let's get shitfaced.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.025
I can't. Sorry, pal.

30:48.955 --> 30:53.115
It must be a big meeting.
- Yeah, I think it could be.

30:55.105 --> 30:59.115
Good. Good luck.
- Thanks, pal.

31:45.065 --> 31:46.995
Something to drink?

31:57.035 --> 31:58.945
I don't drink.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.075
Well, I need one.

32:13.935 --> 32:15.105
Are we waiting for someone?

32:26.965 --> 32:29.105
Why are you looking at me like that?

32:37.945 --> 32:44.935
I'm trying to decide
if I can trust you or not.

32:48.095 --> 32:52.065
You take me to a secluded house
you drink -

32:52.105 --> 32:58.115
- and you're just legally close to me.
Who should trust who right now?

32:58.905 --> 33:00.945
Just legally close?

33:02.115 --> 33:05.905
You have nothing to fear from me.

33:05.985 --> 33:10.995
I don't turn on women.
- What a gentleman.

33:23.095 --> 33:26.895
Sorry I'm late.

33:26.935 --> 33:29.905
Who is this?
- Don't worry about her.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.945
I'll need you to sign for it.

33:52.935 --> 33:56.895
- She's just my type.
- Go away.

34:02.035 --> 34:03.995
What was that about?

34:46.135 --> 34:48.045
Down here.

34:53.895 --> 34:56.995
Do you want a drink?
- I'm OK.

35:09.915 --> 35:12.895
Fuck, man. You really came through for me.

35:19.955 --> 35:23.985
Tell meyou think that's his bookie?

35:24.025 --> 35:25.975
I'm sorry. Trace.

35:30.025 --> 35:32.115
I have to make some calls.

35:37.115 --> 35:39.945
Hey. Do you have a minute?

35:47.995 --> 35:49.995
Take it, my friend.

35:58.985 --> 36:03.115
Sorry, I scared you
by taking you all the way out.

36:03.905 --> 36:10.095
- You're making me nervous.
- It's because you have secrets.

36:10.965 --> 36:12.925
Everyone has secrets.

36:14.025 --> 36:19.915
What is crucial is that it has
nothing to do with Vasily Sirin.

36:21.935 --> 36:23.895
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:23.935 --> 36:27.975
I'm considering buying a house
here in Washington.

36:28.015 --> 36:31.075
- How are you doing here in the area?
- Nice.

36:31.115 --> 36:38.005
I want to learn a little about the
real estate market. May I come in?

37:13.955 --> 37:15.995
You lied to me.

37:20.935 --> 37:22.995
You said you don't drink.

37:24.105 --> 37:28.125
As I said, I was nervous. Do you want one?

37:29.955 --> 37:35.925
- May I look around?
- Of course.

37:43.015 --> 37:44.975
It's a big house.

37:45.955 --> 37:47.985
Yes, I was lucky!

37:54.015 --> 37:57.095
Are these the original wall panels?

37:57.135 --> 37:59.895
I think so.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.065
Nice views.

38:38.135 --> 38:42.995
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.945
I'm actually disappointed.

38:55.075 --> 39:00.925
I didn't think it was my residence
that interested you.

39:08.025 --> 39:09.995
I'm not prepared for that.

39:11.985 --> 39:15.065
- I understand.
- Let me help you.

39:46.085 --> 39:50.135
So, we'd be at lunch...

39:50.975 --> 39:57.895
...and Bob would see one of his counterparts, working 
at the Russian embassy under diplomatic cover...

39:57.935 --> 39:59.995
...and he'd have the guy paged.

40:00.945 --> 40:07.095
"Would Boris Ustinov from the KGB,
please come to the front desk."

40:08.955 --> 40:13.125
I don't know, it seemed
more of a game back then.

40:13.915 --> 40:19.055
Don't get me wrong: people died.
People died but they weren't our people.

40:19.095 --> 40:23.945
They were nameless, faceless 
and very far away.

40:29.115 --> 40:32.025
Eva, there was something...

40:35.055 --> 40:38.985
You said something to me at the hospital.

40:39.025 --> 40:41.125
You probably don't remember but...

40:41.915 --> 40:46.085
I asked you to kill the men
that killed your uncle.

40:46.995 --> 40:50.035
That is not something I would forget.

40:52.015 --> 40:55.085
So you... meant it?

40:56.005 --> 41:00.085
I meant it.
I mean it.
