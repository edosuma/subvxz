WEBVTT

00:00.759 --> 00:03.110
What's up, guys? Bizaardvark
here with our friends,

00:03.145 --> 00:04.327
Dirk, Bernie, and Amelia.

00:06.765 --> 00:08.231
Today we're going to be doing

00:08.266 --> 00:09.799
the "Create a Superhero
Challenge."

00:09.834 --> 00:11.618
We each have 30 seconds

00:11.654 --> 00:14.054
to pick whatever we want
from these trunks...

00:14.089 --> 00:16.147
and create our own superhero.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.991
At the end,
we'll introduce who we are

00:18.026 --> 00:19.768
and what superpower we have.

00:19.803 --> 00:21.628
Nobody take being handsome.

00:21.663 --> 00:23.946
That's my power.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.239
- Uh...
- Just let him have it.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.575
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, yeah!

00:26.610 --> 00:28.084
Here we go!

00:28.119 --> 00:29.978
- Okay.
- Hey, you took my helmet, man.

00:30.013 --> 00:32.539
- It's mine, now.
- Are these fishing boots?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.282
Time's up.

00:34.317 --> 00:35.834
I am, as it says on my shirt,

00:35.869 --> 00:37.577
DIY Woman,

00:37.612 --> 00:39.246
with the power to create

00:39.281 --> 00:41.081
any piece of clothing,

00:41.158 --> 00:43.283
out of any piece of material
in the entire world.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.153
- Very good.
- (horn honks)

00:46.188 --> 00:47.671
And then this is my cape.

00:47.706 --> 00:49.164
- Wow!
- Can you fly?

00:49.199 --> 00:50.715
No.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.068
Hiya! I'm Sanitary Man.

00:53.103 --> 00:54.894
Scrub, scrub. Clean, clean.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.755
I've been cleaning
since I was born.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.615
And remember kids,
if it's not sanitary,

00:58.651 --> 01:00.408
it's not sanitary.

01:00.443 --> 01:02.127
- Good job.
- All right, man.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.495
Yeah!

01:03.531 --> 01:04.471
I am Vision Woman.

01:04.506 --> 01:05.872
I can see all.

01:05.908 --> 01:07.574
I see everything.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.401
I even have eyes
in the back of my head.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.278
I have four pairs
of eyes in the front.

01:11.355 --> 01:13.082
- That way I can see up here...
- No, there's five.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.540
- There's five.
- Five? Okay, I can't see.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.018
- I can't see how many...
- Vision Woman can't see.

01:18.053 --> 01:19.761
- Okay, all right. Next!
- Exactly.

01:19.797 --> 01:21.879
My name is Linda.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.365
Fishing may not be a superpower

01:23.400 --> 01:24.674
to some people,

01:24.710 --> 01:25.895
but to me, it's my whole life.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.677
This horn right here

01:27.713 --> 01:29.796
- summons every fish in the water.
- (honks)

01:29.832 --> 01:31.592
Since we don't have water here,
you can't really see the fish,

01:31.616 --> 01:32.677
but... (horn honks)...
The fish are coming.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.034
I am Gardeno,

01:34.069 --> 01:36.094
prepared for any situation

01:36.129 --> 01:37.729
your grandma's garden
can throw at me.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.731
I can snip weeds or set traps.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.816
- I'm ready... Gardeno.
- (horn honks)

01:41.852 --> 01:43.968
All: Let's go save the world!

01:44.004 --> 01:45.696
- Whoo!
- I'm a gardener.

01:45.731 --> 01:46.938
(honking continues)

01:46.973 --> 01:49.048
I will summon the fish.

01:49.084 --> 01:52.043
Everyone go to the ocean.
They're coming!

(zombie voices) Rebecca...

02:55.100 --> 02:58.785
Tony is dying to go
to prom with you.

02:58.820 --> 03:02.572
Do you accept his promposal?

03:02.607 --> 03:05.759
Say yes, if you've got
any brains.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.072
(cheering)

03:10.107 --> 03:12.707
Aw. Zombie nerd love.

03:12.743 --> 03:14.960
The grossest kind.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.670
Who would've thought
we would become

03:16.705 --> 03:18.955
the promposal queens
of Sierra High?

03:18.991 --> 03:20.732
I would have.
We spend all our time

03:20.768 --> 03:22.567
being creative and making videos

03:22.602 --> 03:24.562
while other people go out
and develop emotionally.

03:27.599 --> 03:29.759
We should really reconsider
how we spend our free time.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.270
That promposal was amazing!

03:34.305 --> 03:36.397
You guys are on fire!
Nine for nine.

03:36.432 --> 03:38.625
What can we say, we're good.

03:38.660 --> 03:41.695
Hey, so, uh, do you think you could
hook me up with a promposal?

03:41.730 --> 03:44.039
Bernie, prom is for seniors.
You're a freshman.

03:44.074 --> 03:47.309
More like a fresh... man.

03:47.344 --> 03:48.904
Someone's allowed to wear
deodorant now.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.312
You know you're supposed to put
that on under the shirt, right?

03:55.761 --> 03:57.102
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.717
Anyway, uh, there's this girl
I've had my eye on for prom.

04:03.752 --> 04:06.127
Her name is Kate
and she's a senior.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.403
I'm sure she'd be into me, too.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.191
What was that?

04:11.226 --> 04:12.617
A wink.

04:16.431 --> 04:19.082
You know what? We could
use a good challenge.

04:19.118 --> 04:20.842
We're gonna make it ten for ten.

04:20.877 --> 04:22.343
Dust off your tux, my friend,

04:22.378 --> 04:23.670
you are going to prom!

04:23.705 --> 04:25.714
Yes!

04:25.749 --> 04:27.415
(phone dials)

04:27.450 --> 04:29.184
Grandma,

04:29.219 --> 04:29.893
what you doing after school?

04:29.928 --> 04:33.096
'Cause this guy needs to go
to the deodorant store.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.247
Dirk!

04:42.282 --> 04:45.141
You're just in time for the
series finale of Cali Beach High.

04:45.176 --> 04:47.310
Guess who I'm dressed as?

04:47.345 --> 04:49.278
Duh, you're Kylie,

04:49.314 --> 04:51.247
the varsity
beach volleyball star.

04:51.282 --> 04:52.351
Where's your evil twin sister?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.433
You mean...

04:54.469 --> 04:55.910
Delilah?

04:58.190 --> 04:59.630
That's for kissing
Kylie's boyfriend.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.392
I'm dressed as Brody,
the troubled lifeguard

05:03.428 --> 05:04.988
with a quick temper
and mysterious past!

05:08.158 --> 05:10.275
That's for kissing Delilah!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.677
(phone alarm chimes)

05:12.713 --> 05:14.987
You guys, it's starting!

05:15.023 --> 05:17.382
I'm sorry, guys.
I love Cali Beach High,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.119
but I promised my brother I'd
watch it with him this weekend.

05:19.143 --> 05:21.036
So, please, no spoilers.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.355
(theme music plays)

05:29.988 --> 05:32.347
Okay, punching bag man,

05:32.382 --> 05:34.215
we should be safe
from any spoilers in here.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.410
Amelia: He died?
I can't believe he died!

05:38.955 --> 05:41.489
Okay, don't freak out.

05:41.525 --> 05:43.875
I mean, she could be
talking about anyone.

05:43.910 --> 05:48.129
Amelia: Principal Tate
McCallister died!

05:48.164 --> 05:50.798
Still not a spoiler. I mean,
he could have dyed his hair,

05:50.834 --> 05:53.493
or... or... or his Easter eggs.

05:53.528 --> 05:55.553
Viking guy: Principal
Tate McCallister died!

05:55.588 --> 05:57.199
And now they're burying him
in the ground!

05:57.223 --> 05:59.341
At a funeral! Because he's dead!

05:59.376 --> 06:01.359
That is what's happening
right now!

06:01.394 --> 06:03.103
La, la, la, la, la...

06:06.391 --> 06:10.202
All right, all you have to do
is show us who Kate is,

06:10.278 --> 06:11.923
and we'll start working
on your perfect promposal.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.538
And perfect is what
you'll be getting.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.282
Super cocky high-five!

06:15.317 --> 06:16.449
Ch, ch, ch...

06:18.904 --> 06:20.019
There she is!

06:20.055 --> 06:21.621
(rock music plays)

06:22.940 --> 06:25.417
♪ ♪

06:32.484 --> 06:33.484
(record scratches)

06:34.377 --> 06:36.336
Wait.

06:36.371 --> 06:38.029
Kate...

06:38.064 --> 06:41.249
is Katherine Davis?

06:41.284 --> 06:43.418
She's captain
of the tennis team.

06:43.453 --> 06:45.778
And class president,
and an honor roll student!

06:45.813 --> 06:47.814
Yeah, her legs are long.

06:49.967 --> 06:52.302
Uh...

06:52.337 --> 06:54.871
have you ever talked
to Kate before?

06:54.906 --> 06:56.466
- Like, in my head?
- So, that's a "no."

06:58.443 --> 07:00.560
Bernie, are you sure that

07:00.595 --> 07:01.889
is who you really
want to ask to prom?

07:01.913 --> 07:06.358
Yup. I would have never had the
guts to ask Kate on my own,

07:06.393 --> 07:09.018
but now that I have you guys,
I'm guaranteed a "yes."

07:09.054 --> 07:10.978
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to get fitted

07:11.014 --> 07:12.338
for a large child-sized suit.

07:18.012 --> 07:20.163
Frankie, this is awful!

07:20.198 --> 07:21.981
Kate is never
gonna say yes to Bernie.

07:22.016 --> 07:23.625
She is totally
out of his league.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.427
I know! Our perfect
promposal record

07:25.462 --> 07:26.870
is about to be shattered.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.255
And more importantly,

07:29.290 --> 07:31.224
our friend will be devastated.

07:31.259 --> 07:32.967
He'll be publicly humiliated

07:33.002 --> 07:34.360
and probably scarred for life.

07:37.199 --> 07:39.359
You know, sometimes you make
me feel like a bad person.

07:44.614 --> 07:46.831
What's up, guys? Bizaardvark
here, with Amelia.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.416
From Perfect Perfection.

07:50.779 --> 07:52.320
You've got to promote the brand.

07:52.355 --> 07:54.280
We're here for a
Multi-Task Challenge

07:54.315 --> 07:55.540
where we try to do two things

07:55.575 --> 07:56.766
at the same time.

07:56.801 --> 07:57.983
We're gonna see if Paige

07:58.019 --> 07:59.227
can jump rope while bageling.

07:59.263 --> 08:01.112
Cream cheese.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.708
- All right, there we go.
- There we go.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.824
(giggling)

08:04.859 --> 08:06.292
Here I go.

08:06.328 --> 08:08.470
Come on, spread it.

08:08.505 --> 08:09.641
You already spread it?
I didn't see.

08:09.665 --> 08:11.439
Good job! We did it!

08:11.474 --> 08:13.174
Now, we're gonna try
to play paddle ball

08:13.209 --> 08:14.261
while putting on lip gloss.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.127
Ready? Go!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.487
- Oh, wait...
- Ah!

08:21.025 --> 08:22.634
Ahh!

08:22.669 --> 08:23.885
- We did it.
- Yup.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.562
Think we nailed it.

08:25.597 --> 08:27.505
For the final round,
Frankie will multi-task

08:27.540 --> 08:28.906
three things at once.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.133
What?

08:30.168 --> 08:33.445
She'll be jumping rope,
while holding this dessert,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.274
and texting, "I hope I don't
drop this thing."

08:35.298 --> 08:36.581
I was not aware of this.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.991
That's gonna drop.

08:38.026 --> 08:39.220
- You've got this!
- You've got it!

08:39.244 --> 08:40.969
- It's got to be a challenge.
- Easy as pie.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.671
Ahh!

08:43.706 --> 08:45.448
(laughs)

08:45.483 --> 08:47.275
This isn't gonna work!

08:47.310 --> 08:48.868
Okay, I have, "I hop."

08:48.904 --> 08:50.895
You got to try. You do hop!

08:50.931 --> 08:52.530
- Hold that pie!
- Hold that pie!

08:52.566 --> 08:54.974
Ahh!

08:55.010 --> 08:57.126
I did it! "I hope I don't
drop this thing!" I did it!

08:57.162 --> 08:59.921
And that was
the Multi-Task Challenge.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.957
- That was pretty dang hard.
- It was really, really hard.

09:02.993 --> 09:04.687
Especially holding up this thing.
I think I have biceps now.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.452
Yeah. Oh!

09:09.474 --> 09:11.541
We can't let Bernie
prompose to Kate,

09:11.576 --> 09:13.434
or he'll be humiliated
when she rejects him.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.621
I still don't know
if convincing him

09:14.645 --> 09:16.362
to go to this
body builder convention

09:16.397 --> 09:18.473
on the night of prom
is gonna work.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.566
Of course it'll work,
the dude loves his muscles.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.905
Any time anyone asks him
for directions,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.970
he's like...

09:24.005 --> 09:25.513
it's over there.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.516
And it's never over there.

09:30.503 --> 09:31.863
Oh, here he comes.
Get in position!

09:33.631 --> 09:35.623
Whoa!

09:35.659 --> 09:37.259
What's going on?
I thought the gym was...

09:38.036 --> 09:39.193
over there.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.739
Or is it over there?

09:46.152 --> 09:49.095
Hey, broseph. We're just
getting ready for BodyCon.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.481
You know,
the bodybuilder convention?

09:51.516 --> 09:52.827
No way!
Is that coming back to town?

09:52.851 --> 09:55.543
Last year I didn't have all
this chest hair to show off.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.589
- Uh...
- Just let him have it.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.268
Anyway, it's on the night
of the 23rd.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.020
You should come with us.

10:06.055 --> 10:07.622
The 23rd? That's prom night.

10:07.657 --> 10:09.665
But... they're giving
out weights

10:09.700 --> 10:12.018
to the first hundred
people who come.

10:12.054 --> 10:14.062
They're literally free weights.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.398
I am cheap.

10:19.678 --> 10:21.911
But I can't pass up
going to prom with Kate,

10:21.946 --> 10:23.746
especially when I'm
gonna look so good

10:23.781 --> 10:25.523
promposing in my tuxas.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.375
- Your what?
- My tuxas.

10:27.410 --> 10:29.778
It's like a tux, but more Texas.

10:29.813 --> 10:31.529
You mean it's shaped like Texas?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.381
No, I mean it feels like Texas.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.249
You mean, like a cactus?

10:35.285 --> 10:39.312
No! That's obviously a cactux!

10:39.347 --> 10:41.947
Oh, and I also made a list of other
things I want in my promposal.

10:43.284 --> 10:45.159
A mariachi band?

10:45.195 --> 10:46.827
A baseball player?

10:46.863 --> 10:48.855
A T-shirt cannon?

10:48.890 --> 10:50.148
Is there a theme here?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.399
Did you think about it?

10:51.434 --> 10:53.017
Did you think about it?

10:54.253 --> 10:55.561
So much.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.440
Also, be pirates.

11:01.402 --> 11:02.610
Well, that didn't work.

11:04.047 --> 11:06.022
What do we do now?

11:06.057 --> 11:07.965
What if,

11:08.001 --> 11:11.085
before Bernie can
prompose to Kate,

11:11.120 --> 11:12.829
another girl asks him to prom?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.623
(both laughing)

11:23.108 --> 11:25.325
No, but seriously,

11:25.360 --> 11:26.729
we need to bribe someone
to ask Bernie to prom.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.336
See?

11:28.371 --> 11:29.929
You can be a bad person too.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.042
(horn sounds)

11:35.077 --> 11:36.911
Live Like a Viking channel!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.622
(laughing)

11:39.658 --> 11:41.983
Yes, ships and shields
are very good.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.726
Oh.

11:43.761 --> 11:46.079
Greetings, viking warriors.

11:46.156 --> 11:48.372
Welcome to another episode
of Live Like a Viking!

11:48.407 --> 11:51.350
Today's topic: Vikings!

11:51.385 --> 11:53.586
Sweet. I'm just glad
to be somewhere

11:53.663 --> 11:55.532
where people aren't talking
about Cali Beach High.

11:55.556 --> 11:56.784
Then you've come
to the right place.

11:56.808 --> 12:00.535
But first, let's dish about
the finale of Cali Beach High.

12:00.570 --> 12:03.479
Can we please
stick to viking stuff?

12:03.515 --> 12:04.995
"Can we please
stick to viking stuff?"

12:07.786 --> 12:10.386
Today we're bringing on
special guest Amelia,

12:10.422 --> 12:12.747
from Perfect Perfection,

12:12.782 --> 12:15.524
to teach us about
how to make viking snacks.

12:15.559 --> 12:18.386
Yeah, we've got grapes,

12:18.421 --> 12:20.120
or some sort of meat leg.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.782
(gasps) Speaking of legs,

12:22.859 --> 12:24.520
isn't it cool that Chad
won the surfer competition

12:24.544 --> 12:26.377
with only one leg?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.987
That was on Cali Beach High!

12:28.023 --> 12:30.765
Guys, please! No spoilers!

12:30.800 --> 12:33.384
"Guys, please! No spoilers!"

12:33.420 --> 12:35.745
Let's take some calls
from our warriors at home.

12:39.117 --> 12:41.909
Phil, from Houston, you're on.

12:41.945 --> 12:43.595
(over phone) Hey, VG.
Had a quick question

12:43.630 --> 12:46.338
on battle helmets
vs. Battle shields.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.350
Perfect. Mind if I
take this one?

12:49.385 --> 12:50.994
- In the Dare world...
- But before that,

12:51.029 --> 12:54.614
can you discuss the big breakup
on Cali Beach High? Yeah!

12:54.649 --> 12:56.732
- No!
- Which one?

12:56.767 --> 12:58.434
Everyone broke up. Everyone!

12:58.469 --> 13:00.911
Oh...

13:00.947 --> 13:02.814
Except Principal Tate McCallister.
He died!

13:05.552 --> 13:07.163
- What's up, guys? I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.019
(together)
And we're Bizaardvark.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.215
- Do you want to make pancakes?
- I'd rather make art.

13:10.239 --> 13:11.274
How about we make pancake art?

13:11.298 --> 13:12.451
I love it when we compromise.

13:12.475 --> 13:13.794
- Batter up!
- Is that a sports thing?

13:13.818 --> 13:15.201
I don't know.

13:15.237 --> 13:16.496
(together)
Pancake art challenge!

13:16.520 --> 13:18.087
Flower!

13:18.122 --> 13:20.006
Okay, I'm gonna make
a sunflower.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.003
I am just gonna make a rand...
I don't even know.

13:25.655 --> 13:27.872
Oh, man. I think I'm gonna
be good at this.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.006
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.636
Okay, um, how am I
gonna flip this?

13:33.672 --> 13:35.162
(gasps) Oh, my gosh, I did it!

13:35.198 --> 13:36.213
(screams)

13:36.248 --> 13:37.882
Flower!

13:37.917 --> 13:39.475
Next up, we're gonna make a cat.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.294
- Cat?
- Yeah.

13:41.329 --> 13:43.489
- That's like a step up from a flower.
- I know, it is.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.718
My cat is superior because...

13:48.753 --> 13:52.146
Ohh! Because it doesn't
have a body?

13:52.182 --> 13:54.515
Yours doesn't have a body.
How does it move around, huh?

13:54.550 --> 13:57.260
- Go.
- Ohh! It looks so good!

13:57.295 --> 13:58.453
Oh, my gosh.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.037
(together) Cats!

14:00.072 --> 14:01.358
I think that we should make
portraits of each other.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.832
Ooh! Yeah!

14:08.623 --> 14:10.915
(gasps) Oh, my God. Look at you!

14:10.950 --> 14:13.008
It looks so great!

14:13.044 --> 14:15.269
Wow! Where are my glasses?

14:15.304 --> 14:17.738
I forgot your glasses!

14:17.773 --> 14:19.242
- Oh my gosh, it totally does look like you.
- It does.

14:19.266 --> 14:21.409
(together) Portraits!

14:21.444 --> 14:23.388
- I think I did pretty well.
- I think I did pretty well too.

14:23.412 --> 14:24.823
- You know what?
- I think we both did very well.

14:24.847 --> 14:26.355
Our creations!

14:27.934 --> 14:29.951
Mmm.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.873
Mmm, so good. Tastes almost
better than it looks.

14:39.554 --> 14:41.395
(screams)

14:41.430 --> 14:44.423
There's five bucks
in my retainer case!

14:44.458 --> 14:46.000
Not on my watch, buddy.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.434
Bernie Schotz, your mission
is to go to prom with me.

14:55.470 --> 14:58.212
Do you accept?

14:58.247 --> 15:00.548
Bernie (thinking): Amelia
Duckworth is asking me to prom?

15:00.583 --> 15:03.409
Wait...

15:03.445 --> 15:05.019
something good
is happening to me?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.223
My Bernie senses are tingling.

15:09.258 --> 15:12.392
Before I say yes,

15:12.428 --> 15:14.603
how did you come up
with this promposal idea?

15:14.638 --> 15:15.988
Uh...

15:19.018 --> 15:20.201
Line?

15:22.546 --> 15:25.014
Seriously?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.675
Sorry, Bernie, if it makes
your feel any better,

15:27.711 --> 15:30.351
I only did it because they gave me
this really cute outfit to wear.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.656
That is pretty cute.

15:34.692 --> 15:37.438
What are you guys doing? You're supposed
to be helping me ask Kate to prom!

15:37.462 --> 15:40.087
We are trying to help you.

15:40.123 --> 15:42.615
We just... we don't want you
to get humiliated in public.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.183
Humiliated?

15:46.921 --> 15:49.161
You don't think there's a
chance Kate will say yes to me?

15:50.766 --> 15:51.766
No.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.655
Oh.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.031
I get it now.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.320
My friends think I'm a loser.

16:04.405 --> 16:05.405
Bernie, wait.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.296
You really think
my outfit's cute?

16:17.552 --> 16:19.493
Hey, Bernie.

16:19.529 --> 16:22.004
Oh. Hey.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.081
Did you come here
to make me feel bad again?

16:24.116 --> 16:26.050
'Cause when Bernie Schotz
is getting jacked,

16:26.085 --> 16:27.885
nothing can make me feel small.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.061
(groans)

16:30.923 --> 16:32.189
Maybe one less?

16:34.552 --> 16:36.285
We are so sorry.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.878
We feel awful for what we did.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.332
Yeah, we were just
trying to protect you.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.907
From what? Exposing
myself as a loser?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.493
(groaning)

16:45.880 --> 16:47.288
One less.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.494
It's my fault, anyway.

16:53.530 --> 16:56.439
I pictured myself walking
into that prom with Kate,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.125
and it felt so good.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.026
You might not know this
about me,

17:01.062 --> 17:02.262
but I don't get a lot of wins.

17:04.015 --> 17:08.092
I don't even know if Kate
would have said yes,

17:08.127 --> 17:10.644
but if she did, I would have
felt like I could do anything.

17:14.692 --> 17:16.808
You know what, Bernie?

17:16.844 --> 17:18.597
- You deserve the chance to find out.
- Yeah.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.262
And we're gonna help you
ask Kate to prom

17:20.297 --> 17:21.772
with our biggest,
best promposal yet!

17:21.807 --> 17:24.375
Really?

17:24.452 --> 17:27.019
Thanks, guys! I'm feeling
confident already.

17:27.055 --> 17:28.704
Make it one more.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.585
(groaning)

17:34.620 --> 17:36.128
Maybe one less?

17:38.607 --> 17:40.140
This isn't a battle-axe
convention!

17:40.175 --> 17:41.751
Hey guys, I'm Amelia,

17:41.786 --> 17:42.726
and these are my friends,

17:42.761 --> 17:44.278
Bernie and Viking Guy.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.529
And today we're doing

17:45.565 --> 17:46.355
the Viking Ring Toss Challenge.

17:46.390 --> 17:49.400
Oh, I love it! It has the
word "viking" in it!

17:49.436 --> 17:51.085
What is it?

17:51.120 --> 17:53.495
Well, you stand there
like a pole,

17:53.531 --> 17:55.439
while Bernie and I
take these rings,

17:55.474 --> 17:57.077
throw them at your head, and try
to land them on your horns.

17:57.101 --> 17:58.784
Oh.

17:58.819 --> 18:01.119
Quick, before he backs out!
Go, go, go!

18:01.155 --> 18:03.395
Here, put these on, put these on.
Okay, just stand still.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.275
- (buzzer)
- You're horrible.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.560
Oh! That was pretty good.

18:08.596 --> 18:10.629
Whoa. Not so good.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.056
Great game, guys. I'm winning.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.424
Wait, I have an idea.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.646
What if this time, we try it
while you're on your knees?

18:16.670 --> 18:18.870
Yeah, 'cause I'm short.

18:18.906 --> 18:20.567
- Oh, you're doing the...
- No, like, both knees.

18:20.591 --> 18:23.468
That doesn't matter. I have to
look regal while I do this.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.377
You got worse!

18:25.413 --> 18:26.807
You're closer and I'm down
here and you're worse!

18:26.831 --> 18:30.508
This is really hard, but I
have a really good strategy.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.560
- (chuckles)
- Jump cut!

18:32.595 --> 18:33.886
Yeah, we did it!

18:33.921 --> 18:35.771
Every ring is on your head!

18:35.806 --> 18:37.732
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:37.767 --> 18:39.475
Oh, dear! Oh...

18:39.510 --> 18:40.751
Sorry!

18:40.786 --> 18:42.319
(slow motion laugh)

18:47.010 --> 18:49.226
Guys, great news!

18:49.261 --> 18:51.003
I just watched the finale
of Cali Beach High

18:51.038 --> 18:53.089
and I am ready to dish.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.315
Can you believe Chad
rode that dolphin

18:55.350 --> 18:57.159
into the eye of a hurricane?

18:57.194 --> 18:59.428
Chad...

18:59.463 --> 19:00.588
Which one was he again?

19:02.358 --> 19:05.592
Chad. The main character
of the show?

19:05.627 --> 19:07.213
The one who we find out
is secretly dating

19:07.237 --> 19:08.879
Kylie's evil twin
sister, Delilah?

19:08.914 --> 19:11.190
What are all these names?

19:11.225 --> 19:13.792
Is this a dream you had?

19:13.827 --> 19:16.703
Guys, it's Cali Beach High.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.596
Two days ago you couldn't
stop talking about it.

19:17.631 --> 19:19.590
Exactly.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.268
Cali Beach High
is so two days ago.

19:22.303 --> 19:23.936
Now we're watching
a brand new show

19:23.971 --> 19:25.921
that's totally different:

19:25.956 --> 19:29.116
Zombie Beach High!

19:29.151 --> 19:31.743
Don't say anything. That's the
next show I want to watch...

19:31.779 --> 19:34.012
Can you believe that zombie Chad

19:34.048 --> 19:35.681
and zombie Kylie are married?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.649
And adopted a puppy?

19:37.684 --> 19:40.044
You want to know a spoiler?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.896
I really don't.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.464
The puppy's a zombie!

19:45.442 --> 19:48.118
You know what? I give up.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.593
Just tell me
any spoiler you want to.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.050
I'm going out with
your mom next weekend!

19:57.647 --> 20:00.356
No!

20:03.252 --> 20:05.878
Guys, you all set?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.532
Paige (over walkie-talkie):
Yup. All stations are a go.

20:07.556 --> 20:10.449
Copy. How's my breath? (Exhales)

20:10.484 --> 20:13.324
- Paige: Bernie, walkie-talkie's don't...
- Frankie: Tell him it's fine.

20:14.621 --> 20:17.048
Guys, here she comes!

20:17.083 --> 20:18.483
Paige: We're on our way.
Go get her!

20:20.903 --> 20:22.920
- Kate!
- (gasps)

20:24.816 --> 20:26.798
You don't know me,

20:26.834 --> 20:29.359
but my name is Bernie Schotz.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.387
- As you know, prom is...
- Wait.

20:31.422 --> 20:34.639
- Are you asking me to prom?
- Don't pepper spray me!

20:34.675 --> 20:37.317
(laughs) You're funny.

20:37.352 --> 20:39.845
I'd love to go with you.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:41.790 --> 20:44.183
I'm so glad someone
finally asked me.

20:44.218 --> 20:45.834
Most guys don't even talk to me

20:45.870 --> 20:48.111
because they think
I'm intimidating.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.488
By the way, I love that suit.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.450
It's kind of like a Texas tux.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.912
Like a tuxas.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.708
Oh, my gosh.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.095
This is the happiest
I'll ever feel.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.030
(laughs) You're cute.

21:07.065 --> 21:11.402
(giggles) What's happening?

21:11.437 --> 21:14.113
I'm just glad you didn't do
one of those huge promposals.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.716
If you had done one,

21:16.751 --> 21:19.393
I would have
definitely said "no."

21:19.428 --> 21:21.437
(quietly) Back, back!
Everyone, back!

21:24.325 --> 21:26.992
Wait! What about the
other things we planned?

21:27.027 --> 21:28.736
(dramatic music plays)

21:32.416 --> 21:33.783
(baseball bat clanks)

21:33.818 --> 21:36.126
What was that?

21:36.161 --> 21:37.736
Uh, what... is... anything...

21:37.771 --> 21:38.996
really?

21:40.399 --> 21:43.842
Wow, you're deep.

21:43.877 --> 21:45.619
(dramatic music plays)

21:45.654 --> 21:47.413
- (gasps) The cake!
- Go!

21:47.448 --> 21:49.006
We should practice
our slow dance!

21:54.012 --> 21:56.071
Oh, wow. You're good!

21:56.106 --> 21:57.389
My grandma taught me.

21:59.135 --> 22:00.692
(mariachi music playing)

22:00.728 --> 22:02.728
What the...?

22:02.763 --> 22:05.313
(music stops)

22:05.349 --> 22:07.850
Did you just hear music?

22:07.885 --> 22:09.735
Only in my heart.

22:11.847 --> 22:14.239
- That's everything, right?
- Oh, no.

22:14.274 --> 22:16.542
The T-shirt cannon
confetti bomb finale.

22:16.577 --> 22:19.119
(dramatic music plays)

22:32.501 --> 22:34.359
What was that?

22:34.395 --> 22:36.637
That... was Bernie Schotz
getting his first win.

22:41.602 --> 22:43.769
Come on, Kate. This is gonna
be the best night ever.

22:46.715 --> 22:49.035
Paige (narrating): Yes, Bernie
did take Kate to the prom...

22:52.880 --> 22:55.400
Frankie (narrating): And oh, man,
it was a complete train wreck.

22:57.026 --> 22:59.192
Paige: Trying to request a song,

22:59.228 --> 23:01.412
Bernie tripped
and destroyed the DJ table.

23:03.733 --> 23:05.373
Frankie: Then he fell
into the punch bowl.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.319
Paige: His uncoordinated
dance moves

23:09.354 --> 23:11.505
gave her a horrific
bloody nose...

23:13.701 --> 23:16.886
Frankie: And somehow started
three simultaneous fires.

23:16.921 --> 23:19.496
(sirens wail)

23:19.531 --> 23:21.699
Bottom line: It was
a better night than usual

23:21.734 --> 23:22.799
for Bernie Schotz.

23:22.834 --> 23:27.946
Yeah.
