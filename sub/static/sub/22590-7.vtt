00:09.177 --> 00:12.222
<i>NARRATOR". Another brisk bright day
blossoms in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.388 --> 00:16.351
<i>But is day the only thing
that's blooming, or isn't blooming?</i>

00:16.518 --> 00:19.187
The park is ready, commissioner.
The police are ready.

00:19.354 --> 00:23.441
All the flower children in Gotham City
are ready for their fancy flower-in.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.443
But there are no flowers.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.113
No flowers in Gotham City, Chief O'Hara?

00:29.280 --> 00:32.116
Somehow someone
has cornered the flower market.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.576
Mainly the lilacs.

00:33.743 --> 00:38.164
Oh, sure, there's gonna be trouble
at that flower-in with no flowers, begorra.

00:38.331 --> 00:40.083
Plenty of trouble.

00:41.584 --> 00:44.629
And all because I, Louie, the Lilac...

00:45.296 --> 00:47.173
...the great Louie, the Lilac...

00:47.340 --> 00:49.801
...have cornered the flower market.

00:49.968 --> 00:52.804
But what do you expect
to gain by that, Louie?

00:53.179 --> 00:55.265
Some young people
of the flower generation...

00:55.431 --> 00:57.934
...will be the future leaders
of the country, Arbutus.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.479
And when I have them within my flower-power,
and control their minds...

01:01.646 --> 01:05.775
...Gotham City will be my garden
to loot and plunder.

01:05.942 --> 01:09.028
And later, the world.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.280
To the Flowermobile.

01:10.446 --> 01:12.073
Let's start with Princess Primrose.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.492
They all tune in on her.

01:17.328 --> 01:21.499
<i>NARRATOR".
While at the flowerless flower-in...</i>

01:48.985 --> 01:51.863
Some flower-in, Princess Primrose,
without any flowers.

01:52.030 --> 01:55.491
I mean, it's freaky, man.
Like, how can we take a flower love trip?

01:55.658 --> 01:59.871
Think flowers, Dogwood.
You know, just think flowers.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.583
Barbara. Barbara Gordon.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.003
Hello, Thelma.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.464
It's not Thelma any longer, Barbara.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.549
I'm Princess Primrose.

02:11.716 --> 02:16.387
I'm a flower child now,
and these are my flower friends.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.723
We're having a flower-in, you know.

02:18.890 --> 02:22.185
It's cool, man, and you'll blow your mind.

02:22.352 --> 02:26.481
I think we'll call you Hyacinth.

02:26.648 --> 02:29.150
I think you've flipped a petal or two.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.320
It's Louie, the Lilac, in his Flower mobile.

02:32.487 --> 02:35.198
Oh, I knew Louie, the Lilac
would come to our rescue.

02:35.365 --> 02:36.908
There you are. Flowers.

02:37.075 --> 02:38.576
Oh, I'm grooved, man.

02:38.743 --> 02:43.581
Lilacs for my flower children.
There you are. Lilacs, lilacs.

02:43.748 --> 02:47.126
Flowers. Lilacs for my flower children.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.128
Flowers. Lilacs.

02:49.295 --> 02:53.257
There you are, all of you. Lilacs, lilacs.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.637
Ah, Princess Primrose.

02:58.388 --> 03:03.935
Come, let's go back to my greenhouse
and plan our worldwide flower-in.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.658
Away, Acacia.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.247
Man, now, that really gets me uptight.

03:24.414 --> 03:27.083
I mean, Princess Primrose splitting
with Louie, the Lilac?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.960
I mean, that's a bum trip.

03:29.127 --> 03:32.630
Like, these plastic flowers
ain't where it's at, man.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.382
I'm tuned out, you know?

04:46.788 --> 04:50.208
But, Daddy, somehow he mesmerized her
and then drove off with her.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.961
Barbara, the police have many serious things
to worry about.

04:54.128 --> 04:58.049
Besides some Princess Primrose
being whisked away from a public park...

04:58.216 --> 04:59.592
...in a Flowermobile.

04:59.759 --> 05:03.471
That's just it. She wasn't whisked away,
she was kidnapped. I'm sure of it.

05:03.638 --> 05:07.391
And she's a friend of mine. I went to college
with her when she was Thelma Jones.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.895
We're late for a meeting
with the city council, Barbara. Relax.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.980
I can't relax.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.817
I'm late too. I should've
been at the library an hour ago.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.445
Barbara, a good librarian is a calm librarian.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.550
Of course, Ms. Gordon. I'll call him.

05:40.716 --> 05:44.428
It's, uh, Commissioner Gordon's
daughter, sir.

05:44.846 --> 05:47.306
Barbara Gordon on the red phone?

05:47.932 --> 05:49.350
This is Batman, Ms. Gordon.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.103
I probably shouldn't have used
this phone, Batman.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.980
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

05:54.146 --> 05:58.025
Not at all. Robin and I were just
putting a flower decal on the Batmobile.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.028
We're to be guests of honor
at a flower-in this afternoon.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.282
That's what I wanted to talk to you about,
the flower-in.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.660
<i>NARRATOR". And in Louie, the Lilac's
isolated greenhouse...</i>

06:07.827 --> 06:11.789
<i>...which, in turn,
houses his humid hothouse...</i>

06:11.956 --> 06:14.667
I don't know what you did to me,
Louie, or why I'm here...

06:14.834 --> 06:17.545
...but how can I run a flower-in
from this greenhouse?

06:17.712 --> 06:20.339
Flower-ins aren't of prime importance
to me, Primrose.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.384
It's the flower children,
and you're their princess.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.304
Sometimes I think
I'm too much of a ding-a-ling.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.682
- So does Barbara Gordon.
-Barbara Gordon?

06:29.849 --> 06:33.811
The police commissioner's daughter
who works at Gotham Library.

06:33.978 --> 06:38.399
She was walking through the park this morning
when you arrived in your Flowermobile.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.067
Police Commissioner Gordon?

06:44.155 --> 06:46.616
All right, Primrose, into the hothouse.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.161
A good place to keep you out of sight
until your friends get my message.

06:50.328 --> 06:54.206
Lock the door. When the stupefying aromatic
spray from my pocket lilac wears off...

06:54.373 --> 06:58.419
...she may try to get out. Acacia,
you keep your eye on her, you understand?

06:58.586 --> 07:01.339
And see that the hothouse
lets off more steam than she does.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.176
Arbutus, tail Barbara Gordon. Who knows
what she might have told her father?

07:05.593 --> 07:06.928
Get going.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.846
I'm going down to police headquarters.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.766
The Batmobile's usually parked
in an alley nearby.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.434
This may be my big chance.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.811
I don't dig this fade-out
of Princess Primrose.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.482
And I don't dig Louie, the Lilac, either.
Or his plastic flowers.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.860
I mean, flower people try to do good,
you know, and spread joy-pollen.

07:23.027 --> 07:25.029
But all Louie does is make a bad scene.

07:25.196 --> 07:29.700
So let's us make a little rumble
down at fuzztown. Come on.

07:41.045 --> 07:44.048
My daughter Barbara had no right
to call you with the red phone.

07:44.215 --> 07:46.759
It precipitated the first
real argument we've ever had.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.552
'Tis a sad thing to hear.

07:48.719 --> 07:52.556
She was understandably concerned
about Princess Primrose.

07:52.723 --> 07:55.476
And this Louie, the Lilac,
what do you know about him?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.811
Very little, Batman.

07:56.978 --> 08:00.272
We'll check with the Batcomputer about
the present whereabouts of Louie, the Lilac.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.068
- Yes, Bonnie?
- Commissioner...

08:04.235 --> 08:07.071
<i>...there are a bunch of flower children
out here to see you.</i>

08:07.238 --> 08:08.739
Flower children?

08:08.906 --> 08:11.659
All right, send them--
Wait a minute, Bonnie. Hold on.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.578
We'll go out the window.
Otherwise, we'll be mobbed.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.415
Mobbed? In police headquarters?

08:17.581 --> 08:20.793
The flower children think we're cool, man.
We turn them on, you know.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.838
Yes, please, be gentle
with your visitors, commissioner.

08:24.005 --> 08:27.508
Although it may not be understood
by more literal minds...

08:27.675 --> 08:30.011
...in their own way,
they're doing what they can...

08:30.177 --> 08:34.807
...to correct the world's woes
with love and flowers.

08:40.730 --> 08:43.441
All right, Bonnie. I'll see them now.

08:48.154 --> 08:51.157
Brace yourself for some nutty
nosegays, Chief O'Hara.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.420
What's that?

09:04.587 --> 09:06.839
It's a flowery little advertising card, Robin.

09:07.006 --> 09:11.177
"Lila's Lilac Shop. 11 Lavender Lane."

09:11.343 --> 09:13.721
This bears investigation.
I strongly suspect...

09:13.888 --> 09:19.935
...that this lilac-colored card
could be a plant.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.533
Lila? Louie.

09:37.495 --> 09:39.371
- Lila?
-Yes, Louie.

09:39.538 --> 09:43.000
You may be receiving a couple
of unusual customers, Lila.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.376
Batman and Robin.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.045
Batman and Robin?

09:46.212 --> 09:48.339
If they've fallen for my little ruse.

09:48.506 --> 09:51.008
<i>Do you still have
some</i> alba <i>vulgaria in stock?</i>

09:51.175 --> 09:52.843
Poison lilacs?

09:53.010 --> 09:56.347
There may be some tired ones around,
Louie. Why?

09:56.514 --> 10:01.352
I'm sure that the dynamic duo will be
overwhelmed by their fragrance anyway, Lila.

10:01.519 --> 10:06.607
And I'll be there shortly to help you dispose
of the soon-to-be-creped crusaders.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.906
Amazing.

10:14.073 --> 10:16.575
Truly amazing.

10:17.076 --> 10:19.787
Look at all these lilacs, Robin.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.916
Good day, gentlemen.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.962
Obviously you haven't been affected
by the current flower shortage in Gotham City.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.713
I guess I'm just lucky.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.842
Lucky, or being favored
for some special reason?

10:33.008 --> 10:35.553
I'm afraid I don't understand you, Batman.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.389
But my display is nice, isn't it?

10:38.556 --> 10:43.894
And I have some other very rare lilacs
in the rear room, if you'd like to see them.

10:44.061 --> 10:47.898
I'm always interested
in the unusual of any specie.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.359
I'll bring them out.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.161
What do you think? A wild lilac chase'?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.454
I think she makes a delightful distraction...

11:02.621 --> 11:06.667
...for whatever Louie, the Lilac's
ultimate scheme may be.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.505
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.715
I'll get them.

11:12.882 --> 11:16.218
Robin, look out.
Those could be poison alba vulgaria.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.518
<i>While</i> in Barbara Gordon's apartment...

11:24.685 --> 11:29.356
I may be imagining things, Charlie, but I think
some man followed me home from the library.

11:29.523 --> 11:33.068
He came up the service stairs
when I took the elevator.

11:34.028 --> 11:38.449
If he found the fire escape landing,
he might very well be out on my--

11:38.908 --> 11:40.951
What are you doing on this terrace?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.913
Just admiring the view of Gotham City,
lady, that's all.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.374
From my terrace? Faced the wrong way?

11:47.541 --> 11:50.294
The police will be interested in this.

11:52.838 --> 11:56.550
The police ain't gonna be interested
in nothing at all, lady.

11:59.303 --> 12:02.806
<i>NARRATOR". And while Barbara
faces her vexatious visitor...</i>

12:02.973 --> 12:06.727
<i>...what's happening in the hothouse
of Louie's greenhouse?</i>

12:06.894 --> 12:10.147
Man-eating lilacs? Holy purple Cannibals.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.565
Exactly, Boy Blunder.

12:11.732 --> 12:16.028
A rare specie just in from Brazil which I
crossed with even more carnivorous plants.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.988
And gusty gourmands they are.

12:18.155 --> 12:22.159
They got ahold of an explorer one day in the
jungle and left nothing but his shoelaces.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.663
What happened to Princess Primrose?

12:25.829 --> 12:29.291
She's drying out in the office.
Flower children wilt fast.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.378
She and her flower friends
will do more than just wilt...

12:32.544 --> 12:34.088
...before I'm through with them.

12:34.255 --> 12:38.592
- Come on, let's get out of here.
-Oh, yes, Louie. It's so humid in here.

12:42.972 --> 12:47.184
Gosh, Batman, what a way to go.
Eaten alive by a lilac.

12:47.351 --> 12:51.939
Well, Robin, at least it's a flowery finish.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.611
<i>NARRATOR". With the dynamic duo
being devoured whole...</i>

12:57.778 --> 13:00.990
<i>...by a strange specie of man-eating lilac...</i>

13:01.156 --> 13:04.201
<i>...what are we doing here in the Batcave?</i>

13:04.368 --> 13:07.329
<i>Maybe this call on the red phone will tell us.</i>

13:07.496 --> 13:08.664
I'm sorry, sir. He's out.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.749
- Out where?
-I don't know, sir.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.545
When he and Master Robin left,
they were on their way to your office.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.631
When they left, they were
on their way back to the Batcave...

13:17.798 --> 13:22.052
...to consult the Batcomputer about
a renowned criminal named Louie, the Lilac.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.595
Louie, the Lilac?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.931
If you hear from Batman,
have him contact me.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.683
Of course, sir.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.065
Barbara's phone is dead, Batman is out.
Nothing is going--

13:35.232 --> 13:37.776
Now, commissioner,
watch your blood pressure.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.571
To consult the Batcomputer...

13:40.738 --> 13:45.242
...about a renowned criminal
called Louie, the Lilac.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.789
And he hasn't been heard from since.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.935
"Lila's Lilac Shop. 11 Lavender Lane."

14:12.644 --> 14:15.898
At least they're gentle about it.
I haven't felt one bite me yet.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.317
Man-eating lilacs have no teeth, Robin.

14:18.484 --> 14:21.987
It's a process of ingestion
through their tendrils.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.365
Batman, we've gotta
get out of this somehow.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.493
Can't you get to your utility belt
and signal Alfred?

14:27.659 --> 14:30.788
No, they've already consumed
my utility belt, Robin.

14:30.954 --> 14:36.085
And my hands are entwined
by these vicious vines.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.128
Holy Luther Burbank.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.631
How are they doing, Louie?

14:40.798 --> 14:42.800
Ooh! I can't look.

14:42.966 --> 14:47.221
A lilac's digestive processes
are much slower than a human.

14:47.388 --> 14:48.931
It takes a little time.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.641
You monster.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.309
Monster?

14:52.476 --> 14:57.523
What would your flower children think
of such language from their princess?

14:57.689 --> 15:02.528
I'm sure that when you speak to them shortly,
you'll talk of me in much more endearing terms.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.577
Let's really put my flower-power
to work in the park.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.663
To the flower-in.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.295
<i>Whilst</i> in Barbara's apartment...

15:20.712 --> 15:25.384
Lady, it don't take no 10 minutes
to powder your nose in a locked bedroom.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.139
- Who are you? What do you want?
-From one interloper to another...

15:30.305 --> 15:33.350
...perhaps you might answer those questions.
-I ain't interloping.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.186
A lady friend of mine
just locked herself in her bedroom.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.815
If she looked herself in the bedroom,
there must have been a reason.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.818
Well, that's her reason and mine, not yours.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.447
- You, uh, got some connection with Batman?
-Speaking of connections...

15:46.613 --> 15:49.533
...what happened to that phone?
-She was gonna call the cops--

15:49.700 --> 15:54.538
So you ripped out the phone and she locked
herself in her bedroom? Why were you here?

15:54.705 --> 15:55.873
Now, wait a minute, wait.

15:56.039 --> 16:00.085
Everything's gonna be all right. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving now. I'm getting out of here.

16:00.919 --> 16:04.423
The cops and her father,
Commissioner Gordon.

16:11.972 --> 16:15.559
Strange, that looked like Batgirl
out on the terrace.

16:15.726 --> 16:16.852
Batgirl?

16:17.686 --> 16:18.729
Batgirl?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.399
Oh, Barbara, I've been so worried about you.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.193
What was Batgirl doing here?

16:24.359 --> 16:28.739
Batgirl? I believe you saw the intruder
who followed me home from the library.

16:28.906 --> 16:32.284
I tried to call you at the office,
but he ripped out the phone.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.245
Put men around this building
and have that phone repaired.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.080
When you wanted to be on your own...

16:37.247 --> 16:41.710
...when you insisted on taking an apartment,
I was afraid something like this would happen.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.795
Oh, Daddy, nothing's happened.

16:43.962 --> 16:47.090
I locked myself in the bedroom
and I'm perfectly all right. Really.

16:47.257 --> 16:51.303
- I think you should move back home.
-Is that what you were trying to call me about?

16:51.470 --> 16:54.973
No, I-- I thought you might have dinner
with me tonight.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.558
But when the line was dead...

16:56.725 --> 16:59.770
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry.
And I'd love to have dinner with you tonight.

16:59.937 --> 17:03.065
First I have to go back to the library
for a while this afternoon.

17:03.232 --> 17:06.734
I'd only come home for lunch
and discovered the intruder.

17:06.902 --> 17:10.821
Well, he won't intrude on you again,
I can tell you that for sure.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.450
I hope you're right, Chief O'Hara.

17:15.202 --> 17:19.248
Thank you for being worried about me.
I'll call you when I get home from work.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.290
Good girl. Bye.

17:25.546 --> 17:27.798
There's a lot of traffic on that balcony today.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.385
I went through your service hall,
and then came along the outside ledge.

17:31.552 --> 17:36.348
I couldn't risk being caught. After all,
we're the only ones who know our little secret.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.726
The rumor's around that something's
happened to Batman and Robin.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.020
Mr. Wayne looked into it a bit...

17:42.187 --> 17:44.481
...but I have reason to believe...

17:44.648 --> 17:48.819
...that they were last seen
in a florist's on Lavender Lane.

17:48.986 --> 17:54.032
Though the Batmobile has been located
outside an isolated greenhouse.

17:55.033 --> 18:00.664
I can't tell all you flower children what a fine
and generous man Louie, the Lilac, is...

18:00.831 --> 18:04.376
...and how he's cornered the flower market
to make this flower-in a success.

18:04.543 --> 18:08.922
And what hopes and dreams he has
for us and the future of the world.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.968
And what hopes and dreams he has
for us and the--

18:13.135 --> 18:18.015
<i>NARRATOR". What's this? Apparently Louie's
stupefying aromatic spray has worn off.</i>

18:18.181 --> 18:19.850
And...

18:23.312 --> 18:26.356
You've tripped out, Primrose.
Groovy, but in the wrong groove.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.191
You're right, man.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.526
He's tuned out.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.320
Grifty.

18:31.486 --> 18:35.240
And now he's putting a period on Batman
and Robin in his poisonous purple pad.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.783
Batman and Robin?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.703
Wow, man, he ought to be
called Louie, the Louse.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.080
Get us out of here, Acacia. Get us out quick!

18:44.541 --> 18:46.293
After him!

18:46.710 --> 18:48.754
- Let's go!
- Let's get him!

19:02.517 --> 19:06.772
<i>NARRATOR". And shortly,
back with the semi-digested duo.</i>

19:06.938 --> 19:10.359
One of these monsters is nibbling
at my ear, Batman.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.695
I said, one of these monsters
is nibbling at my ear.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.530
I heard you, Robin.

19:15.697 --> 19:19.284
I've managed to loosen one foot.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.536
There's a flower pot next to it.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.373
If I can just kick it through that glass.

19:24.748 --> 19:28.377
Well, we finally got rid
of those flower creeps for now.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.797
But' I'll get my flower-power to work yet.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.385
I wonder how the Brazilian man-eaters
are doing with the dynamic duo.

19:41.682 --> 19:44.393
Aah! They're not even chewed up a little.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.270
Nor will we be. A word of advice, Louie.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.399
One blast of cool air
kills these blooming cannibals...

19:50.565 --> 19:53.694
...far quicker than
they can devour any human repast.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.903
Gosh, yes.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.488
Get Azalea, Petunia.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.586
Not you again.

20:53.670 --> 20:57.090
- How did you get mixed up in this?
-Maybe some other time and place...

20:57.257 --> 21:01.511
...we can have a question-and-answer session,
Batman, but not here.

21:04.848 --> 21:09.311
Louie, she's got a spray can
of powdery mildew.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.189
Don't use it. Don't use that spray.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.776
Anything it touches molds and decays.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.081
They're getting away, Batman.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.375
Don't worry, Robin. Go out to the Batmobile.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.295
Alert Commissioner Gordon,
he'll round them up.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.255
He's mildewed.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.927
He's wilting.

21:46.223 --> 21:50.894
Maybe mildewed and wilting and molding
and decaying on the outside, Lila.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.730
But inside I'm still Louie, the Lilac.

21:53.897 --> 21:58.068
And somehow, some day, I'm going
to control the flower market of the world.

21:58.235 --> 22:01.404
And with it, the entire flower generation.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.784
Batman, there's about a thousand
flower children outside.

22:05.951 --> 22:09.454
They found your Flowermobile,
and they're after your budding scalp.

22:09.621 --> 22:14.084
Louie, it looks like it's lilac time for you.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.919
Never.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.256
Never! Never!

22:20.590 --> 22:23.426
Batman, he's thrown himself
into the man-eating lilacs.

22:23.593 --> 22:27.931
Don't worry, Robin. That cold blast of air
put those lilacs in a torpor.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.725
Go back outside
and calm the flower children.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.978
- They'll mob me.
-Groovy.

22:34.938 --> 22:38.483
And I think your car's arriving.
Batgirl, would you take this young lady--?

22:38.650 --> 22:42.779
She's gone, Batman.
She knew when to get out of here.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.491
Smart dame. Who is she?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.953
I don't know.

22:50.245 --> 22:53.957
I never have, perhaps I never will.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.792
But I Wish I did.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.507
I calmed down the flower children
and they've gone, Batman.

23:44.674 --> 23:48.178
And the police have taken Lila away.
I said we'd bring in Louie, the Lilac.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.808
Holy hoof beats.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.853
Exactly, Robin.

23:57.020 --> 24:01.191
And if I'm not mistaken, a band
of Bessarovian Cossacks just rode by.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.985
Olga, wait for me. Olga.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.655
Oh, come on. Excuse me.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.907
Darling, hurry up. We don't have all day.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.201
- Oh, Olga.
-Come on.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.037
Olga, wait for me. Wait.

24:14.204 --> 24:17.123
Egghead. What do you suppose he's
doing back in Gotham City?

24:17.290 --> 24:19.834
And that woman.
She looked like a real Tartan princess.

24:20.001 --> 24:24.756
I predict that Batman and Robin will soon
be getting a call on the red telephone.

24:24.923 --> 24:28.885
But first let's rescue Louie, the Lilac,
from those clinging vines.

24:29.052 --> 24:31.054
<i>NARRATOR".
Be sure to watch the next episode...</i>

24:31.221 --> 24:34.224
<i>...for what Egghead
and a Tartar princess named Olga...</i>

24:34.391 --> 24:37.102
<i>...have in store for the Caped Crusaders.</i>
