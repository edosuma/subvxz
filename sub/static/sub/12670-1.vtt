00:30.675 --> 00:32.040
Cambodia.

00:33.278 --> 00:36.008
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

00:36.214 --> 00:39.377
Another world, a secret world.

00:39.684 --> 00:43.620
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

00:43.822 --> 00:47.349
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

00:48.293 --> 00:51.489
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

00:51.695 --> 00:54.789
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

00:55.166 --> 00:57.930
It was there, amidst the fighting...

00:58.135 --> 01:01.468
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

01:01.672 --> 01:05.266
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

01:05.476 --> 01:08.468
...a man who was to change my life...

01:08.679 --> 01:11.648
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

01:20.858 --> 01:23.656
So here we go
with Voice of America...

01:23.861 --> 01:25.852
...news for Southeast Asia.

01:26.063 --> 01:30.193
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

01:30.401 --> 01:32.664
Clouds too in Washington.

01:32.869 --> 01:36.635
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

01:36.840 --> 01:38.705
...within the next few days.

01:38.908 --> 01:41.536
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

01:43.379 --> 01:47.406
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

01:47.617 --> 01:51.212
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

01:51.421 --> 01:54.288
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

01:54.491 --> 01:57.119
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

01:57.327 --> 02:00.694
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

02:00.897 --> 02:04.765
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

02:04.968 --> 02:07.766
...for an American President
in 20 years.

02:19.581 --> 02:22.345
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

02:22.551 --> 02:25.520
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

02:25.721 --> 02:27.382
...for a stay of the injunction...

02:27.589 --> 02:31.081
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

02:31.293 --> 02:34.285
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

02:34.496 --> 02:38.762
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.212
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

03:21.175 --> 03:23.302
Information. Information.

03:23.511 --> 03:28.448
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

03:28.649 --> 03:32.278
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

03:53.707 --> 03:55.834
Mister, you want taxi?

03:56.042 --> 03:58.306
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

04:25.838 --> 04:28.898
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

04:33.312 --> 04:34.973
What's all this shit?

04:38.017 --> 04:39.416
I'm sorry.

04:40.219 --> 04:43.586
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

04:44.089 --> 04:47.650
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

04:47.860 --> 04:50.294
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

04:50.496 --> 04:53.431
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

04:53.632 --> 04:55.997
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

05:05.977 --> 05:08.309
What the fuck is that on your head?

05:10.815 --> 05:14.307
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

05:15.953 --> 05:18.615
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

05:20.491 --> 05:22.618
No, I just came from the airport.

05:23.561 --> 05:26.553
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

05:26.898 --> 05:29.389
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

05:29.867 --> 05:30.856
Thanks a lot.

05:48.719 --> 05:49.913
What do you want to eat?

05:52.022 --> 05:52.886
Want some eggs?

05:53.090 --> 05:56.617
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

05:56.827 --> 05:59.057
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

05:59.262 --> 06:00.820
I'm having a café complet.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.831
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

06:11.575 --> 06:15.136
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

06:15.345 --> 06:17.244
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

06:17.847 --> 06:20.782
I read somewhere that they put...

06:23.119 --> 06:26.748
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

06:26.956 --> 06:28.116
What's the difference?

06:29.592 --> 06:34.029
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

06:48.344 --> 06:50.744
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

06:50.946 --> 06:52.277
What was it? A rocket?

06:52.481 --> 06:55.177
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

07:04.058 --> 07:05.491
I've been looking for you.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.251
I left a message for you.

07:07.462 --> 07:09.487
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.632
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

07:12.834 --> 07:16.201
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.730
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

07:19.941 --> 07:22.432
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

07:23.411 --> 07:24.469
We're going.

07:24.746 --> 07:27.237
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.406
Where you going, Schanberg?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.412
Neak Luong.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.876
Neak Luong's closed.

08:02.082 --> 08:05.848
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.545
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

08:09.756 --> 08:14.659
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

08:14.862 --> 08:17.728
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

08:20.299 --> 08:21.459
Let's go!

08:32.410 --> 08:34.504
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

08:38.551 --> 08:43.453
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.985
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.492
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

08:50.696 --> 08:52.755
You don't know anything about it?

08:53.499 --> 08:54.557
No, I don't.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.023
All right.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.360
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

09:00.572 --> 09:02.597
...and then I'd like a comment.

09:02.974 --> 09:06.671
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

09:06.878 --> 09:10.974
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

09:11.182 --> 09:12.740
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

09:12.951 --> 09:16.751
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

09:17.322 --> 09:20.587
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

09:20.992 --> 09:25.156
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

09:25.363 --> 09:27.263
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

09:27.465 --> 09:30.628
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

09:30.835 --> 09:34.896
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

09:38.776 --> 09:39.743
No comment.

09:40.711 --> 09:41.871
How many killed?

09:44.949 --> 09:46.246
How many wounded?

09:51.822 --> 09:54.552
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

09:56.827 --> 10:01.059
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

10:43.940 --> 10:45.066
I'm sorry.

10:45.641 --> 10:47.609
This is just not good enough.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.801
This is a big story...

10:50.013 --> 10:54.245
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

10:54.450 --> 10:56.543
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

10:56.753 --> 10:58.744
I want to get down that river!

10:58.955 --> 11:00.683
We should be down there now!

11:13.068 --> 11:14.399
I'll be here.

11:16.972 --> 11:18.462
Good night, Sydney.

11:27.582 --> 11:29.345
- Messages?
- No, sir.

11:29.885 --> 11:30.874
No, sir.

11:32.921 --> 11:36.152
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

11:36.358 --> 11:38.826
Let's get together again soon, okay?

11:39.027 --> 11:40.391
- Bob?
- See you.

11:40.861 --> 11:41.828
Bob?

11:42.930 --> 11:44.921
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

11:45.132 --> 11:48.329
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

11:48.536 --> 11:51.505
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

11:51.705 --> 11:54.003
Let's not start insulting each other.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.937
Good night, Sydney.

11:58.846 --> 12:00.313
All right, good night.

12:05.786 --> 12:07.651
You've heard of pilot error?

12:07.855 --> 12:09.345
Computer malfunction?

12:09.790 --> 12:11.690
They screwed up on the coordinates.

12:11.892 --> 12:15.658
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

12:17.398 --> 12:20.094
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

12:21.701 --> 12:23.692
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

12:23.903 --> 12:28.602
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

12:30.043 --> 12:31.271
How many?

12:33.680 --> 12:36.478
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

12:36.683 --> 12:39.948
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

12:40.153 --> 12:43.247
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

12:43.723 --> 12:46.419
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

12:49.129 --> 12:51.324
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.631
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

12:54.234 --> 12:57.635
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

12:57.837 --> 13:00.305
Americans take themselves so seriously.

13:00.507 --> 13:05.307
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

13:05.511 --> 13:09.106
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

13:09.314 --> 13:11.839
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.108
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

13:13.318 --> 13:15.309
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

13:15.521 --> 13:17.921
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

13:19.658 --> 13:22.422
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

13:23.829 --> 13:26.263
The Yanks all at sea...

13:30.102 --> 13:32.195
- All right?
- Very possible.

13:33.372 --> 13:34.839
Let's go then!

13:42.847 --> 13:44.337
This is good work.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.543
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

14:29.893 --> 14:30.882
One hundred!

14:36.933 --> 14:38.400
- All right?
- All right.

14:46.243 --> 14:47.938
Nice going, Pran.

15:46.701 --> 15:49.363
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

15:49.570 --> 15:54.007
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

16:20.535 --> 16:22.628
Tell me what she's saying.

16:24.938 --> 16:26.428
She needs help.

16:30.377 --> 16:33.005
Her shop was destroyed last night.

16:34.214 --> 16:35.647
Her husband killed.

16:35.849 --> 16:37.077
How many bombs?

16:39.019 --> 16:40.281
She doesn't know.

16:41.388 --> 16:43.413
Does she know where the hospital is?

16:45.192 --> 16:46.523
"Just over there."

16:52.833 --> 16:55.063
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

16:57.704 --> 17:00.502
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

17:00.874 --> 17:04.105
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

17:05.277 --> 17:08.246
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

17:09.515 --> 17:10.378
"Five."

17:10.849 --> 17:13.284
Her husband was killed already.

17:17.589 --> 17:18.852
What's this?

17:19.325 --> 17:21.088
What are these guys over here?

17:26.432 --> 17:29.333
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

17:52.457 --> 17:54.448
They kill a lot of villagers.

17:54.826 --> 17:57.386
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

17:57.595 --> 17:59.620
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

17:59.831 --> 18:01.822
...then set the rags alight.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.226
Film! No film!

18:03.435 --> 18:04.925
I know there's no film.

18:05.136 --> 18:06.262
No camera!

18:07.539 --> 18:08.597
No camera!

18:08.940 --> 18:10.134
It's all right.

18:13.111 --> 18:14.544
Just take it easy.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.076
Tell them we're jour...

18:31.762 --> 18:33.161
Come on! Get in!

19:17.340 --> 19:18.967
I'm worried.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.809
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.809
They accuse me and they arrest me.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.873
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.377
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.221
I want some cigarettes.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.868
And I need to take a leak.

19:50.038 --> 19:52.029
Would you tell them I need to piss?

20:16.197 --> 20:17.687
He said, "No piss."

20:19.534 --> 20:20.660
What does that mean?

20:21.202 --> 20:23.067
That's no piss.

20:27.576 --> 20:29.805
I've had enough of this bullshit.

20:30.477 --> 20:32.468
I got a story to get to New York!

20:37.718 --> 20:39.015
Don't leave me!

20:49.897 --> 20:51.159
I won't leave you.

21:59.998 --> 22:02.398
They brought in the whole press corps!

22:02.601 --> 22:05.934
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

22:16.381 --> 22:18.508
I am going to tell you something.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.411
I'm walking out of here.

22:20.619 --> 22:22.951
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

22:23.221 --> 22:26.213
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

22:26.425 --> 22:28.359
...and I am walking out of here!

22:31.128 --> 22:34.393
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

22:42.807 --> 22:46.937
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

22:47.144 --> 22:48.941
It's still a restricted area.

22:49.146 --> 22:51.410
Now, if you look across the river...

22:51.615 --> 22:54.550
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

22:54.752 --> 22:56.549
...who moved in over
the past few days.

22:56.754 --> 22:59.985
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

23:00.191 --> 23:03.683
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

23:04.595 --> 23:06.290
Get in the chopper now!

23:06.597 --> 23:10.055
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

23:10.267 --> 23:12.461
That won't stop my story!

23:15.205 --> 23:16.137
What is this?

23:16.339 --> 23:19.365
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

23:19.576 --> 23:22.477
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

23:22.679 --> 23:24.510
If anybody ever reads about this...

23:24.714 --> 23:27.410
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

24:07.589 --> 24:08.783
Good morning.

24:09.625 --> 24:10.614
What time is it?

24:12.594 --> 24:14.118
Six o'clock.

24:15.564 --> 24:16.462
Shit.

24:16.665 --> 24:17.893
Telex for you.

24:18.534 --> 24:20.001
You been to the telex?

24:22.404 --> 24:23.769
We made the front page.

24:23.972 --> 24:24.939
Sure.

24:27.042 --> 24:29.101
We must be doing something right.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.678
My wife is very worried.

24:40.321 --> 24:43.916
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

24:45.426 --> 24:46.859
Well, Pran...

24:48.062 --> 24:52.465
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

24:53.901 --> 24:56.995
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

24:57.205 --> 24:59.366
...the future could be very bad.

25:01.242 --> 25:02.539
What do you think?

25:05.613 --> 25:06.944
I don't know.

25:09.450 --> 25:10.815
I don't know either.

25:13.587 --> 25:15.555
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

25:16.790 --> 25:18.189
Let's get going.

25:19.159 --> 25:20.126
All right.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.696
Don't go back to sleep.

25:27.901 --> 25:28.993
I won't.

25:37.978 --> 25:40.208
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.438
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

25:42.649 --> 25:46.085
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

25:46.286 --> 25:48.550
Now look at all this fucking mess!

25:55.761 --> 25:58.992
In America, everybody got a good car.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.599
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

26:03.802 --> 26:06.862
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

26:07.072 --> 26:09.267
Mercedes, number one!

26:09.808 --> 26:12.333
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

26:15.314 --> 26:17.782
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

26:17.983 --> 26:20.042
Mercedes, number one, okay?

26:58.323 --> 26:59.381
What did he say?

26:59.590 --> 27:02.616
He said he thought all
American people left already.

27:03.261 --> 27:05.195
Made in the USA.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.724
Are we winning?

27:10.635 --> 27:12.728
No, you're not winning.

27:12.937 --> 27:14.267
What should we do?

27:14.471 --> 27:17.702
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

27:20.677 --> 27:23.009
The first section came
by Route number 36.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.377
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.075
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.953
He doesn't know how many.

27:32.155 --> 27:34.146
They expect an attack today.

27:34.358 --> 27:35.848
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

27:36.059 --> 27:37.458
- Why there?
- Don't know.

27:37.661 --> 27:39.595
How many mortar rounds you have...?

27:54.011 --> 27:57.605
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

28:00.249 --> 28:02.513
Come on, let's get him out of here!

28:30.212 --> 28:31.543
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

28:31.747 --> 28:33.681
I'm not happy here, Syd.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.782
Jon, I'm leaving.

28:36.051 --> 28:37.609
Syd, come on!

28:37.952 --> 28:38.941
Come on!

28:52.534 --> 28:54.001
Sydney, this way!

29:15.323 --> 29:17.119
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

30:06.706 --> 30:09.641
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

30:09.842 --> 30:12.743
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

30:12.945 --> 30:15.846
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

30:16.048 --> 30:16.946
I can't eat.

30:17.150 --> 30:21.985
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

30:22.722 --> 30:25.782
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

30:25.992 --> 30:29.155
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

30:29.362 --> 30:32.957
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

30:33.166 --> 30:37.397
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

30:37.602 --> 30:40.935
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

30:41.139 --> 30:45.098
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.127
No more electricity.

31:40.397 --> 31:43.025
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.202
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

31:45.402 --> 31:47.734
Alan, this country's split apart.

31:47.938 --> 31:51.738
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

31:51.942 --> 31:53.034
Any port.

31:54.211 --> 31:58.010
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

31:58.214 --> 32:01.775
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

32:04.487 --> 32:07.479
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

32:07.690 --> 32:12.423
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

32:12.629 --> 32:14.893
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

32:15.098 --> 32:18.067
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

32:20.203 --> 32:23.138
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

32:23.339 --> 32:26.934
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

32:27.143 --> 32:28.405
Dith Pran and family.

32:28.611 --> 32:29.635
Right.

32:30.980 --> 32:35.815
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

32:36.019 --> 32:40.751
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

32:41.390 --> 32:44.723
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

32:44.926 --> 32:47.224
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

32:47.429 --> 32:50.330
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.660
What about the airlift?

32:52.868 --> 32:54.426
We're taking it with us.

32:55.304 --> 32:58.637
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

32:58.840 --> 33:01.206
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

33:02.511 --> 33:06.277
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

33:17.759 --> 33:21.216
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

33:26.300 --> 33:30.669
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

33:30.871 --> 33:34.807
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

33:50.224 --> 33:51.782
I'm sorry. I'm late.

33:51.992 --> 33:53.254
Where you been?

33:53.594 --> 33:56.324
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

33:56.530 --> 33:58.157
Yes. I'm sorry.

34:00.700 --> 34:04.158
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

34:04.371 --> 34:08.068
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

34:09.309 --> 34:13.302
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

34:14.981 --> 34:17.347
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

34:17.550 --> 34:18.983
6 p.m.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.987
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

34:24.190 --> 34:26.181
This is a newspaper.

34:29.161 --> 34:30.891
How about update tomorrow?

34:33.666 --> 34:36.533
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

34:46.011 --> 34:48.411
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

34:49.648 --> 34:50.512
Good news?

34:50.716 --> 34:52.513
No, not good news.

34:58.524 --> 35:01.254
They say that when
this place goes up...

35:04.663 --> 35:08.258
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

35:09.501 --> 35:13.164
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

35:16.008 --> 35:18.442
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

35:20.945 --> 35:22.970
Do you want to stay
or leave?

35:31.689 --> 35:32.713
And how about you?

35:33.925 --> 35:35.790
That's none of your business.

35:41.732 --> 35:44.462
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

35:48.039 --> 35:49.233
I know.

35:50.007 --> 35:51.634
You love my family.

35:55.913 --> 35:58.814
But me, I'm reporter too.

35:59.517 --> 36:01.007
You know what I mean?

36:16.199 --> 36:19.862
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

36:20.070 --> 36:21.435
Take it easy.

36:26.476 --> 36:29.570
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

37:42.483 --> 37:45.179
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

37:46.454 --> 37:48.149
This is the last check.

37:51.025 --> 37:53.585
Last check. This is the last check!

38:00.201 --> 38:01.691
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

38:02.003 --> 38:05.062
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

38:05.505 --> 38:07.302
Now, I want you to go right now!

38:07.741 --> 38:09.333
I want you to leave now!

38:09.543 --> 38:11.636
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

38:25.092 --> 38:27.287
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

38:30.464 --> 38:33.763
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

38:33.967 --> 38:36.595
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

38:36.803 --> 38:40.034
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

38:53.219 --> 38:54.982
Have you seen Pran?

38:55.187 --> 38:56.176
No, I haven't.

38:56.956 --> 38:57.980
Where is he?

39:01.994 --> 39:03.791
Well, it's been real.

39:09.301 --> 39:10.791
They're gonna miss it.

39:11.570 --> 39:14.095
Why don't you check around
the other side?

39:14.774 --> 39:17.800
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

39:29.921 --> 39:32.355
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

39:32.557 --> 39:34.752
No, have you looked at the hotel?

39:34.959 --> 39:36.824
He's at the post office!

39:37.228 --> 39:38.820
The post office!

40:07.491 --> 40:09.755
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

40:10.027 --> 40:12.222
Move your asses out of here!

40:12.696 --> 40:14.163
Hold those doors!

40:18.135 --> 40:21.070
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

40:36.954 --> 40:38.444
Yes, sir, what's your name?

40:38.655 --> 40:40.020
Dith Pran family, sir.

40:40.224 --> 40:41.987
Dith Pran family?

40:42.192 --> 40:44.524
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

40:44.995 --> 40:47.485
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

40:47.697 --> 40:49.961
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

40:58.407 --> 40:59.874
Rockoff, help me!

43:12.205 --> 43:13.035
Run!

43:13.506 --> 43:14.996
There's no time!

44:23.574 --> 44:24.541
Wait a minute.

44:28.245 --> 44:29.269
Smile.

44:56.206 --> 44:57.264
Jon.

44:57.841 --> 44:58.933
Hello, Sydney.

45:16.359 --> 45:20.261
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

45:23.033 --> 45:24.330
Who told you that?

45:27.303 --> 45:29.032
The British Embassy.

45:59.535 --> 46:01.196
Khmer Rouge coming.

46:01.403 --> 46:04.566
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

47:08.902 --> 47:10.301
No more fighting!

47:10.670 --> 47:12.001
I be right back!

47:28.155 --> 47:29.986
No more fighting! No more war!

47:30.423 --> 47:31.753
What do you think?

47:32.858 --> 47:34.587
I don't like the look of this.

47:34.793 --> 47:39.492
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

47:39.698 --> 47:42.633
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

47:42.902 --> 47:46.099
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

48:53.537 --> 48:55.903
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

48:56.740 --> 48:59.470
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

48:59.676 --> 49:02.042
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

49:13.390 --> 49:16.689
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

49:16.893 --> 49:18.588
Okay, let's have her over.

49:24.401 --> 49:28.997
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

49:29.906 --> 49:31.931
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

49:32.843 --> 49:35.436
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

49:35.645 --> 49:38.239
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

49:41.083 --> 49:45.247
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

50:13.082 --> 50:15.606
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

50:15.817 --> 50:18.251
For God's sake, back it up now!

51:33.994 --> 51:37.520
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

51:38.030 --> 51:39.327
They won't let him in.

52:02.922 --> 52:04.048
All right?

58:22.925 --> 58:23.857
Okay?

58:24.059 --> 58:25.253
Looks all right.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.728
I'm coming!

01:01:34.646 --> 01:01:36.671
Just a minute! He's with me!

01:01:36.948 --> 01:01:38.779
He's with The New York Times!

01:01:38.984 --> 01:01:42.181
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:46.154
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

01:01:46.423 --> 01:01:49.085
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.894
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:57.499
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

01:01:57.701 --> 01:02:00.363
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:03.699
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:08.469
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

01:02:08.679 --> 01:02:12.979
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

01:02:13.183 --> 01:02:17.313
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:22.083
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:23.759
...are not clear.

01:02:29.665 --> 01:02:32.099
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

01:02:57.894 --> 01:02:58.758
That's the consul.

01:03:08.036 --> 01:03:10.971
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:18.975
Look, piss off! Please!

01:03:19.181 --> 01:03:22.309
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

01:03:30.058 --> 01:03:32.049
First, the main points of the news.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.784
BBC, Dougal.

01:03:36.531 --> 01:03:39.364
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

01:03:39.568 --> 01:03:43.402
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:48.274
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:49.534
...Hugh Elder.

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:53.606
Where do they get this crap?

01:03:54.148 --> 01:03:57.276
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

01:03:58.385 --> 01:04:00.910
Could we not all look at once, please?

01:04:01.689 --> 01:04:05.284
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

01:04:06.026 --> 01:04:06.856
You're kidding.

01:04:07.061 --> 01:04:10.519
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

01:04:10.731 --> 01:04:13.700
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:15.630
With specially trained hens.

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:21.135
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

01:04:21.342 --> 01:04:23.105
...like their regular fowl.

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:27.837
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:29.973
I told you.

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:34.115
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.949
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

01:04:38.158 --> 01:04:41.252
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.088
...be handed over to them.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.026
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

01:04:46.232 --> 01:04:48.325
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

01:04:48.535 --> 01:04:51.971
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

01:04:52.172 --> 01:04:56.108
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.211
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

01:06:29.417 --> 01:06:32.046
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:35.189
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:39.159
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:44.664
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.260
Half of them are under 15.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.907
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.097
Can you help?

01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:54.877
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:57.138
I'd prefer it if it was you.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.950
What did you do that for?

01:07:10.395 --> 01:07:12.556
The guy's insecure enough already.

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:17.359
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

01:07:20.072 --> 01:07:23.633
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

01:07:24.143 --> 01:07:26.203
...and the Cambodians out.

01:08:04.221 --> 01:08:06.018
If you have papers,
you have a name.

01:08:06.223 --> 01:08:08.418
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

01:08:09.192 --> 01:08:11.821
Look, I fight for five years.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:13.828
Useless war.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:17.600
Fuck!

01:08:20.004 --> 01:08:22.769
Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:26.741
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

01:08:27.112 --> 01:08:28.807
Does Syd know how serious this is?

01:08:29.014 --> 01:08:32.676
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

01:08:33.452 --> 01:08:37.513
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

01:08:37.723 --> 01:08:39.919
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

01:08:40.126 --> 01:08:44.323
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:48.435
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

01:08:48.636 --> 01:08:49.863
It's worth a try.

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:53.970
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:10.822
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

01:09:11.026 --> 01:09:12.788
Give me two or three weeks.

01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:16.322
If you get there first, let me know.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:19.629
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

01:09:20.469 --> 01:09:24.200
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

01:09:25.108 --> 01:09:27.099
I got no time to give you.

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:30.475
Swain's got an idea.

01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:38.885
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:41.615
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

01:09:41.826 --> 01:09:44.853
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

01:09:45.064 --> 01:09:46.053
I don't think so.

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:48.593
Give him your passport.

01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:50.961
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:52.228
Khmer Rouge took everything.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.463
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

01:09:54.673 --> 01:09:55.537
Fuck!

01:09:56.108 --> 01:09:58.736
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

01:09:58.944 --> 01:10:02.972
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:06.746
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.443
We'll find the film.

01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:12.957
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.718
No, I haven't got any film!

01:10:14.929 --> 01:10:19.560
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:24.534
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.935
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

01:10:27.275 --> 01:10:28.242
Shit!

01:10:28.745 --> 01:10:32.544
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

01:10:32.748 --> 01:10:36.081
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

01:10:41.157 --> 01:10:43.990
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

01:10:44.894 --> 01:10:48.422
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

01:10:48.632 --> 01:10:49.530
What?

01:10:50.868 --> 01:10:54.702
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

01:10:56.107 --> 01:10:57.768
Come on down here.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.310
Go to the end of the hall there.

01:11:01.646 --> 01:11:03.637
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:07.182
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

01:11:07.386 --> 01:11:10.651
Syd, I have got the camera...

01:11:11.357 --> 01:11:12.948
...I have got the film...

01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:16.418
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

01:11:21.133 --> 01:11:23.363
All right. Don't smile.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.031
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

01:11:29.476 --> 01:11:30.841
Stop, please.

01:11:31.044 --> 01:11:34.037
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:50.120
Okay, cover it.

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:58.098
This fucking paper, I don't know.

01:11:58.837 --> 01:12:01.432
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:05.305
Ankertill Brewer.

01:12:06.179 --> 01:12:08.613
Ankertill Brewer.

01:12:24.232 --> 01:12:26.564
Getting an image.
Look at it.

01:12:26.768 --> 01:12:28.327
Look, the bugger's face.

01:12:28.538 --> 01:12:30.802
It sure is. Come on.

01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:33.003
Come on.

01:12:34.009 --> 01:12:35.101
Come on.

01:12:36.678 --> 01:12:38.203
Now fix it.

01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:41.349
That's good.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.951
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

01:12:47.257 --> 01:12:48.588
Goddamn it.

01:12:49.927 --> 01:12:51.656
Goddamn this paper!

01:12:51.862 --> 01:12:55.128
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

01:13:04.577 --> 01:13:06.169
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:09.372
I did it.

01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:13.050
Let me have that.

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:16.781
It's fading.

01:13:17.723 --> 01:13:18.690
Take it out.

01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:22.692
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:24.659
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

01:13:24.865 --> 01:13:25.923
Fuck!

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:28.500
Goddamn it!

01:13:32.507 --> 01:13:35.908
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

01:13:36.177 --> 01:13:37.508
Could I just...?

01:13:37.945 --> 01:13:39.776
I'll just do it myself, okay?

01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:43.315
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.277
Fuck.

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:47.587
Sorry.

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:03.466
That's it.

01:14:20.192 --> 01:14:21.591
It's perfect.

01:14:22.928 --> 01:14:24.054
Perfect.

01:14:38.844 --> 01:14:41.142
Welcome to New York. We got it.

01:14:41.347 --> 01:14:43.508
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

01:14:43.716 --> 01:14:46.413
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

01:14:46.653 --> 01:14:50.282
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.958
This is the last call for passports.

01:14:53.727 --> 01:14:55.389
Can I have your passports, please?

01:14:56.164 --> 01:14:58.132
Can I have your passports, please?

01:14:59.534 --> 01:15:00.523
Thank you.

01:15:00.835 --> 01:15:02.894
Passports, ladies and gents.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.267
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.778
Your passports, please.

01:15:12.983 --> 01:15:15.144
On this passport depend my life.

01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:17.649
Thank you.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.187
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

01:15:24.794 --> 01:15:28.252
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

01:15:28.465 --> 01:15:31.026
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.827
Come on, passports, please.

01:15:34.205 --> 01:15:36.298
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

01:15:36.507 --> 01:15:37.701
Going...

01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:39.039
...going...

01:15:43.682 --> 01:15:44.706
...gone.

01:16:16.517 --> 01:16:17.712
Is this lunch?

01:16:23.325 --> 01:16:24.189
What?

01:16:27.396 --> 01:16:29.455
It seems certain
that the majority...

01:16:29.665 --> 01:16:34.398
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

01:16:34.603 --> 01:16:37.970
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

01:16:38.274 --> 01:16:39.332
Hello again.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:48.743
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:51.620
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

01:16:54.092 --> 01:16:55.753
Now, listen, everybody.

01:16:57.695 --> 01:17:02.098
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.268
Probably in the next 24 hours.

01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:08.462
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

01:17:08.941 --> 01:17:10.966
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.579
These so-called journalists
have no right...

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:27.954
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:31.825
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

01:17:32.032 --> 01:17:34.398
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

01:18:28.394 --> 01:18:30.828
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:44.464
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:48.740
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.572
Don't forget. All right?

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.682
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

01:20:53.884 --> 01:20:55.647
You had no right to keep him here!

01:20:55.853 --> 01:20:57.980
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

01:20:58.189 --> 01:21:01.159
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

01:21:01.393 --> 01:21:03.452
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

01:21:03.662 --> 01:21:06.654
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

01:21:12.338 --> 01:21:13.703
Goodbye, Rockoff.

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:38.691
Tell my wife I love her...

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.232
...and look after all my children.

01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:45.973
She doesn't speak any English.

01:21:47.877 --> 01:21:49.276
Please...

01:21:49.945 --> 01:21:53.540
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

01:22:29.688 --> 01:22:31.087
Dith Pran.

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:35.222
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:38.625
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

01:22:39.566 --> 01:22:42.558
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

01:22:43.169 --> 01:22:46.536
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.570
In April 1975.

01:22:47.774 --> 01:22:52.474
4144-5364...

01:23:24.447 --> 01:23:26.677
Pran is a resourceful man.

01:23:26.883 --> 01:23:29.512
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.551
...and then he'll make his move.

01:23:47.973 --> 01:23:50.669
Thank you for coming...

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:53.070
...and taking care of her
and her family.

01:23:53.279 --> 01:23:56.738
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

01:23:57.384 --> 01:23:58.749
That's not true.

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:02.853
That's absolutely not true.

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:12.657
It's not true. It's not.

01:24:13.935 --> 01:24:15.800
She doesn't believe you...

01:24:16.003 --> 01:24:19.063
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

01:24:42.199 --> 01:24:43.393
You're a good man.

01:24:45.802 --> 01:24:49.761
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

01:24:53.744 --> 01:24:55.075
You better go.

01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:38.016
For the past 5 years...

01:26:38.591 --> 01:26:41.686
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

01:26:42.129 --> 01:26:46.565
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

01:26:46.766 --> 01:26:50.828
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:52.736
As the President spoke...

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.467
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:02.615
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.785
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:08.385
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:13.857
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

01:27:20.437 --> 01:27:23.406
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

01:27:23.607 --> 01:27:27.338
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

01:27:27.544 --> 01:27:29.068
We will aid Cambodia.

01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:33.682
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

01:32:36.879 --> 01:32:38.006
Sydney...

01:32:38.749 --> 01:32:42.685
...I think of you often
and often my family.

01:32:43.353 --> 01:32:46.686
They tell us that God is dead.

01:32:46.923 --> 01:32:50.155
And now the party they call
the Angka...

01:32:50.361 --> 01:32:53.090
...will provide everything for us.

01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:56.666
He says Angka has identified...

01:32:56.868 --> 01:32:58.859
...and proclaims the existence...

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.300
...of a bad new disease...

01:33:01.506 --> 01:33:06.410
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

01:33:06.612 --> 01:33:09.581
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

01:33:10.482 --> 01:33:14.510
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

01:33:15.088 --> 01:33:17.522
The enemy is inside us.

01:33:18.024 --> 01:33:20.219
No one can be trusted.

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.993
We must be like the ox...

01:33:32.205 --> 01:33:35.903
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:39.546
No love but for the Angka.

01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:45.776
People starve...

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:49.215
...but we must not grow food.

01:33:52.161 --> 01:33:54.129
We must honor the comrade children...

01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:57.595
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

01:34:26.264 --> 01:34:27.663
Is anybody of us...

01:34:27.867 --> 01:34:28.731
...a doctor...

01:34:29.368 --> 01:34:30.460
...professor...

01:34:30.703 --> 01:34:32.136
...and student?

01:34:32.605 --> 01:34:34.402
Angka needs you.

01:34:35.241 --> 01:34:37.210
Angka has forgiven all the past.

01:34:52.126 --> 01:34:53.217
Sydney...

01:34:54.261 --> 01:34:58.722
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

01:34:58.933 --> 01:35:01.595
...in the years
of the great struggle...

01:35:01.802 --> 01:35:05.899
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

01:35:06.975 --> 01:35:10.035
...because now is the year zero...

01:35:10.312 --> 01:35:12.974
...and everything is to start anew.

01:35:21.624 --> 01:35:23.786
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

01:35:24.228 --> 01:35:27.026
I must show no understanding.

01:35:27.565 --> 01:35:29.692
Not of French or English.

01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:32.398
I must have no past, Sydney.

01:35:33.704 --> 01:35:35.831
This is the year zero...

01:35:36.407 --> 01:35:38.637
...and nothing has gone before.

01:35:50.823 --> 01:35:54.657
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

01:35:55.061 --> 01:35:58.053
The war has killed love, Sydney.

01:35:58.497 --> 01:36:02.195
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

01:36:02.536 --> 01:36:05.903
And no one dare ask where they go.

01:36:06.273 --> 01:36:10.574
Here, only the silent survive.

01:41:54.917 --> 01:41:57.512
Mercedes, number one!

01:47:30.915 --> 01:47:35.318
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

01:47:37.923 --> 01:47:41.916
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

01:47:44.195 --> 01:47:47.688
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

01:47:48.033 --> 01:47:50.160
But I can't stand here tonight...

01:47:50.369 --> 01:47:53.031
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

01:47:53.238 --> 01:47:57.869
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

01:48:00.646 --> 01:48:04.083
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

01:48:04.284 --> 01:48:08.618
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

01:48:09.289 --> 01:48:11.723
...concerned themselves
with many things:

01:48:13.094 --> 01:48:17.155
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

01:48:18.466 --> 01:48:21.333
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

01:48:21.636 --> 01:48:25.936
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

01:48:26.908 --> 01:48:29.172
They had domestic concerns as well...

01:48:29.377 --> 01:48:34.179
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

01:48:35.017 --> 01:48:38.714
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

01:48:38.921 --> 01:48:40.514
...in their own careers.

01:48:41.291 --> 01:48:43.987
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

01:48:44.194 --> 01:48:46.719
...were the Cambodians themselves.

01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:48.961
Not the people...

01:48:49.433 --> 01:48:51.425
...not the society...

01:48:51.903 --> 01:48:53.530
...not the country.

01:48:54.806 --> 01:48:58.173
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

01:49:02.114 --> 01:49:03.877
Dith Pran and I...

01:49:04.616 --> 01:49:06.606
...tried to record and bring home...

01:49:06.818 --> 01:49:10.585
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

01:49:11.123 --> 01:49:12.920
To human beings...

01:49:14.226 --> 01:49:16.990
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

01:49:17.197 --> 01:49:19.028
...but who paid the price...

01:49:19.232 --> 01:49:21.427
...and took the beating for them.

01:49:26.907 --> 01:49:31.071
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

01:49:31.612 --> 01:49:33.239
I'm very honored...

01:49:33.914 --> 01:49:36.577
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

01:49:49.297 --> 01:49:53.028
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

01:49:55.705 --> 01:49:58.469
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

01:49:58.674 --> 01:50:00.073
I'm sorry.

01:50:03.146 --> 01:50:06.047
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:09.510
Abe, meet my sister.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.551
I'm very happy to meet you.

01:50:11.755 --> 01:50:14.224
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

01:50:15.326 --> 01:50:16.293
One second.

01:50:16.494 --> 01:50:19.691
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

01:50:19.898 --> 01:50:22.868
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

01:50:23.068 --> 01:50:25.934
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.880
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

01:50:41.488 --> 01:50:44.184
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

01:50:44.391 --> 01:50:47.656
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

01:50:49.130 --> 01:50:51.860
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

01:50:52.066 --> 01:50:52.896
What?

01:50:53.301 --> 01:50:55.997
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

01:50:56.203 --> 01:50:59.332
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

01:50:59.541 --> 01:51:02.271
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

01:51:04.179 --> 01:51:06.306
The fuck you didn't.

01:51:06.914 --> 01:51:10.407
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

01:51:10.619 --> 01:51:12.951
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

01:51:13.155 --> 01:51:14.713
I'm doing everything I can.

01:51:14.923 --> 01:51:18.223
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

01:51:18.428 --> 01:51:21.693
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

01:51:21.898 --> 01:51:25.562
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

01:51:26.437 --> 01:51:28.462
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

01:51:28.672 --> 01:51:32.335
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

01:51:36.047 --> 01:51:39.847
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

01:51:40.385 --> 01:51:41.909
Life isn't a '40s movie.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.955
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

01:51:47.559 --> 01:51:50.357
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:56.464
Congrats.

01:51:58.537 --> 01:52:01.097
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

01:52:01.307 --> 01:52:03.503
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:06.577
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:09.146
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

01:52:09.349 --> 01:52:13.081
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

01:52:13.755 --> 01:52:15.586
We made a mistake.

01:52:16.157 --> 01:52:18.751
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.486
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

01:52:21.697 --> 01:52:22.857
That is provocative...

01:52:23.065 --> 01:52:26.466
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:29.102
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

01:52:29.303 --> 01:52:30.862
Don't you believe them?

01:52:31.073 --> 01:52:34.941
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

01:52:35.144 --> 01:52:37.442
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

01:52:37.646 --> 01:52:40.138
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:42.716
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

01:52:42.919 --> 01:52:45.353
Will you be covering the boat people?

01:52:45.555 --> 01:52:46.681
No, I will not.

01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:48.586
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.155
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

01:52:55.733 --> 01:52:58.362
I must have sent 500 letters.

01:53:03.875 --> 01:53:07.607
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:10.509
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

01:53:11.016 --> 01:53:13.280
I don't know who I didn't write to.

01:53:19.759 --> 01:53:22.421
I never really gave him any choice.

01:53:27.868 --> 01:53:30.996
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

01:53:39.948 --> 01:53:43.407
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

01:53:46.722 --> 01:53:50.020
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

01:53:54.029 --> 01:53:56.554
But I never discussed it with him.

01:54:07.744 --> 01:54:10.680
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

01:54:16.721 --> 01:54:18.586
And I stayed because...

01:57:58.027 --> 01:57:59.893
I'm trapped, Sydney.

01:58:00.096 --> 01:58:04.294
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

01:58:04.934 --> 01:58:08.335
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

01:58:08.638 --> 01:58:10.732
I must take much care.

01:58:11.275 --> 01:58:15.336
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.784
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:25.455
And now they say we must fight them.

01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:31.458
I miss you, my wife, my children.

01:58:31.664 --> 01:58:35.121
And my heart hungers for news of you.

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:00.784
New China Radio reports...

01:59:00.995 --> 01:59:04.295
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.866
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

01:59:07.136 --> 01:59:09.866
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

01:59:10.072 --> 01:59:12.506
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

01:59:16.245 --> 01:59:17.610
Taxi driver, huh?

01:59:35.466 --> 01:59:37.297
I think you speak English.

01:59:37.768 --> 01:59:39.065
Sit down.

01:59:45.277 --> 01:59:47.802
You know, I love this country.

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:52.414
I sacrificed everything for it.

01:59:53.887 --> 01:59:57.378
My wife died for the revolution.

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:03.991
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:08.493
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

02:00:10.337 --> 02:00:12.396
And they don't trust me.

02:00:14.909 --> 02:00:15.773
I fear...

02:00:17.178 --> 02:00:19.511
...really fear for the future.

02:00:23.919 --> 02:00:27.412
I think you love my son.

02:00:30.526 --> 02:00:31.788
For his sake...

02:00:32.862 --> 02:00:34.261
...look after him.

02:00:38.901 --> 02:00:41.495
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

02:00:41.704 --> 02:00:44.172
If the Vietnamese get here...

02:00:44.373 --> 02:00:46.535
...Angka will destroy everything...

02:00:48.679 --> 02:00:50.237
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

02:03:59.585 --> 02:04:03.021
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

02:13:22.429 --> 02:13:24.329
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

02:13:27.267 --> 02:13:31.226
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

02:13:31.438 --> 02:13:33.133
Abe, I've got some great news!

02:13:46.355 --> 02:13:49.415
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

02:13:49.625 --> 02:13:52.526
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

02:13:52.728 --> 02:13:54.822
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

02:13:55.031 --> 02:13:57.898
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

02:13:58.101 --> 02:14:00.729
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

02:14:01.104 --> 02:14:02.800
Is your mother there?

02:14:05.409 --> 02:14:06.568
When?

02:14:08.978 --> 02:14:11.641
All right,
I want you to get this down.

02:14:12.483 --> 02:14:15.145
No, write it down. Write it down.

02:14:16.687 --> 02:14:18.814
I've got a message from your dad!

02:15:31.768 --> 02:15:32.962
How you been?

02:15:46.051 --> 02:15:47.075
Do you forgive me?

02:15:47.786 --> 02:15:50.380
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
