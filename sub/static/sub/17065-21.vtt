WEBVTT

00:00.703 --> 00:02.921
<i>The Westport Town & Country Club.</i>

00:02.984 --> 00:06.195
<i>Upside... it's completely free
if you live in the city limits.</i>

00:06.297 --> 00:08.347
<i>Downside... no mom in this town</i>

00:08.432 --> 00:10.416
<i>has the decency to let herself go.</i>

00:10.484 --> 00:13.652
<i>Women over 25 who actually want
to be seen in a bathing suit.</i>

00:13.738 --> 00:15.220
<i>It's unnatural.</i>

00:15.306 --> 00:16.672
God. It's so nice here.

00:16.757 --> 00:19.274
Said those kids the first time
they saw Neverland Ranch.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.911
- What's that?
- Nothing. Mama's just being silly.

00:22.963 --> 00:25.297
Just don't befriend pop stars.

00:25.383 --> 00:27.733
Maybe Adele.

00:27.818 --> 00:30.703
Okay, this is where I leave you, gang.

00:30.788 --> 00:33.138
Mom, please make Dad change
before you go.

00:33.224 --> 00:35.724
That shirt was out of style
when he bought it 20 years ago.

00:35.793 --> 00:37.603
Joke's on you. I didn't buy this shirt.

00:37.688 --> 00:39.470
It's a hand-me-down from my uncle.

00:39.547 --> 00:41.563
Ugh. There's Emma Conway.

00:41.599 --> 00:43.399
She's gonna make me
play doubles with her.

00:43.484 --> 00:44.450
She's terrible.

00:44.535 --> 00:46.035
Just tell her you don't want to.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.369
Yeah.

00:47.455 --> 00:49.471
Or I could hide in the bathroom all day.

00:49.523 --> 00:52.024
Honey, you have got to start
saying "no" to people.

00:52.109 --> 00:53.642
It's not so hard.

00:53.694 --> 00:55.244
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where the towels are?

00:55.296 --> 00:56.745
No!

00:56.831 --> 00:58.580
Actually, it's just right over there.

00:58.666 --> 01:00.683
I'm in the middle of a life lesson.

01:00.735 --> 01:02.317
I'll be in the clubhouse

01:02.353 --> 01:03.986
schmoozing with the Wall Street guys

01:04.038 --> 01:06.922
so one day I can buy this place
and turn it private

01:07.007 --> 01:09.108
so people like us can't get in.

01:10.227 --> 01:12.194
Okay. Have fun. I'll miss you.

01:12.229 --> 01:14.663
You don't have to miss me.
I'm coming with you.

01:14.749 --> 01:15.864
Don't you want to go swimming?

01:15.933 --> 01:17.132
I'll live.

01:17.184 --> 01:19.385
Ah, but, honey, I was
gonna go home and watch shows

01:19.470 --> 01:21.987
that are inappropriate
for a girl your age.

01:22.073 --> 01:23.872
Ah, screw it. You're an old soul.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.508
You can watch TV-MA. Come on.

01:29.764 --> 01:32.631

01:39.523 --> 01:41.807
Guess I don't need
my pool shoes anymore.

01:41.892 --> 01:43.859
Whoa! Honey!

01:43.894 --> 01:45.060
Your feet stink.

01:45.112 --> 01:47.646
Whoa!

01:47.732 --> 01:48.981
Are you showering?

01:49.066 --> 01:50.733
Yeah, with soap and everything.

01:50.785 --> 01:52.901
By any chance, would
"everything" be a dead seal?

01:54.071 --> 01:55.537
Hey! Are you guys just getting here?

01:55.573 --> 01:57.122
No, we're on our way out.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.958
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause
Marigold and Anna-Kat could...

02:00.044 --> 02:01.126
What is that smell?

02:01.212 --> 02:02.377
It's, um...

02:02.413 --> 02:04.379
No, no, no. You know
I like finding the smell.

02:10.253 --> 02:11.804
- Oh, my.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.090
I know. Now I'm gonna
have to tell everybody

02:15.176 --> 02:16.341
I gave a goat a ride.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.843
Hi, Marigold.

02:17.928 --> 02:18.894
Hi, Mrs. Otto.

02:18.929 --> 02:19.978
Just call me Katie.

02:22.817 --> 02:24.016
Can't.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.237
So, is Taylor inside the club?
Marigold loves Taylor.

02:28.272 --> 02:31.023
Doris, you cannot force Taylor
to babysit for you.

02:31.108 --> 02:34.109
I need a break.
I've been with her all day.

02:34.161 --> 02:35.861
It is 10:15.

02:35.946 --> 02:38.363
She's so boring.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.083
Doris! Don't you have a nanny?

02:41.118 --> 02:42.951
Two, but they're taking care
of my other children.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.186
How many nannies
do you want me to have?!

02:46.090 --> 02:48.257
Fine. I'll take care of her by myself.

02:54.181 --> 02:55.681
How's it going in there?

02:55.766 --> 02:57.816
Great. No need to come in and check!

02:57.902 --> 02:59.485
<i>Now I have to come in and check.</i>

02:59.570 --> 03:01.653
<i>That's how I got caught
with pot in my flashlight.</i>

03:01.739 --> 03:03.872
<i>"No need to check if it works, Mom!"</i>

03:05.309 --> 03:06.608
What are you doing?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.160
You weren't supposed to come in.

03:08.245 --> 03:09.361
Why aren't you in the shower?

03:09.446 --> 03:10.412
I'm scared.

03:10.464 --> 03:12.264
- Of a shower?
- Of the water.

03:12.349 --> 03:15.067
Since when are you scared of water?

03:15.152 --> 03:16.935
They sunk the unsinkable Slocum.

03:17.021 --> 03:18.921
A fire started in the Lamp Room.

03:18.956 --> 03:22.691
The lucky passengers drowned.
The rest burned to death.

03:22.743 --> 03:25.027
Anna-Kat...

03:25.062 --> 03:27.863
less reading, more video games.

03:27.948 --> 03:30.165
Titanic, the Lusitania...

03:30.201 --> 03:31.433
Water kills.

03:31.468 --> 03:33.435
Is that why you wanted
to leave the club?

03:33.521 --> 03:35.187
So you didn't have to go to the pool?

03:35.272 --> 03:38.574
Yes. And I'm not showering, either.

03:38.659 --> 03:41.560
Oh, baby. Don't be scared.

03:41.645 --> 03:43.395
We'll figure it out.

03:44.815 --> 03:47.833
Ohh! Soon.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.585
Real...

03:49.670 --> 03:51.270
real soon.

03:54.575 --> 03:56.575
Dad, a word?

03:56.660 --> 03:59.428
In the clubhouse, I was talking
with Cooper, Tripp, and Weston.

03:59.463 --> 04:00.929
Man, do your friends sound white.

04:01.015 --> 04:03.999
Some of the guys were discussing
the best college golf programs.

04:04.034 --> 04:06.618
Your school came up.
I mentioned you taught there.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.587
And the guys were really impressed.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.806
So you're coming to say you weren't
embarrassed by me for the first time ever?

04:10.858 --> 04:12.574
No. Don't misread the situation.

04:13.577 --> 04:15.127
It's about your jalapeño rating.

04:15.212 --> 04:16.628
My jalapeño rating? What's that?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.346
It's a website students use to rank

04:18.382 --> 04:20.115
how attractive their professors are.

04:20.184 --> 04:21.817
Oh, okay.

04:21.869 --> 04:24.586
1.5. Is that out of 2?

04:24.622 --> 04:26.121
No, it's out of 5.

04:26.206 --> 04:28.390
When is anything ever out of 2?

04:28.442 --> 04:29.524
Siskel and Ebert.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.492
Who's that?

04:30.527 --> 04:33.879
Two guys. Both dead. Forget it.

04:35.749 --> 04:38.233
1.5 jalapeños, huh?

04:38.269 --> 04:39.902
Yeah, but who's really
gonna see this thing?

04:39.987 --> 04:42.838
It's only limited to everyone
who has the Internet.

04:42.873 --> 04:46.358
All you had to say was "lots of people."

04:47.478 --> 04:49.945
There you are, Taylor.
I need you to watch Marigold.

04:49.997 --> 04:51.330
What? No. I'm supposed to play tennis.

04:51.415 --> 04:52.748
Are you back-talking me?

04:52.833 --> 04:54.216
What?! N-No. I-I just...

04:54.268 --> 04:55.995
Great. Then we're agreed.
See you at 6:00.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.152
Don't forget to feed her.

04:59.373 --> 05:03.208
I'm allergic to lots of stuff,
but I don't remember what.

05:06.397 --> 05:10.065
"Professor Otto looks like
a beige sweater came to life

05:10.150 --> 05:12.618
and then threw up
another beige sweater."

05:12.703 --> 05:14.252
Ouch.

05:14.338 --> 05:15.504
I just spoke to Dr. Ellie.

05:15.589 --> 05:17.973
- Oh.
- She said exposure therapy

05:18.008 --> 05:21.443
is the best way to get Anna-Kat
over her fear of water.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.578
What if we just pour
a splash of water on her face

05:23.631 --> 05:25.964
over and over until
she's not scared anymore?

05:26.050 --> 05:28.717
That's called waterboarding, so no.

05:28.769 --> 05:30.319
Why don't you just take her to the pool?

05:30.354 --> 05:31.520
She's always loved it there.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.288
Just take her hand
and slowly walk her in.

05:33.324 --> 05:36.341
Or your hands. You have hands.

05:36.427 --> 05:38.727
She's not gonna do it with me.
You're her favorite.

05:38.762 --> 05:39.928
Ah, I've always known it,

05:39.980 --> 05:41.430
but it feels so good
to hear someone else say it.

05:41.515 --> 05:42.898
Well, I'm glad someone is feeling good.

05:42.983 --> 05:45.000
Do you want to hear what my
students are writing about me?

05:45.035 --> 05:47.085
"What is with his sweaters?

05:47.171 --> 05:50.022
Does he herd sheep
during his office hours?"

05:50.107 --> 05:52.774
Oh, Greg, get over
your jalapeño thing already.

05:52.860 --> 05:54.276
Get over it?

05:54.328 --> 05:56.862
That's not what you're
supposed to tell me.

05:56.947 --> 05:59.297
Whenever you're feeling
insecure, I always boost you up.

05:59.383 --> 06:01.083
But you like doing that.

06:01.168 --> 06:04.219
For me, it is a lot of work
and it doesn't come naturally.

06:04.254 --> 06:05.554
Fine.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.439
But will you please just
take our daughter to the pool

06:07.524 --> 06:09.024
and help her get over her fear of water?

06:10.461 --> 06:11.877
I can't.

06:11.962 --> 06:12.711
Why not?

06:12.796 --> 06:14.212
Don't get me wrong.

06:14.298 --> 06:16.598
I am comfortable with who I am.

06:16.633 --> 06:18.633
I am comfortable
with the way that I look.

06:18.686 --> 06:19.851
Except...

06:19.937 --> 06:20.986
Except what?

06:22.523 --> 06:24.823
Except when I am in that bathing suit

06:24.908 --> 06:28.377
around those stupid women
at that stupid pool.

06:28.412 --> 06:30.829
Oh, honey.

06:32.966 --> 06:35.517
You have nothing to be
self-conscious about.

06:35.552 --> 06:37.552
You're more beautiful
than any of those women.

06:37.604 --> 06:39.354
Incidentally, this is
how you buck someone up.

06:39.390 --> 06:41.473
And you can't let them get in your head.

06:41.558 --> 06:44.276
You're right. I'm being silly.

06:44.361 --> 06:48.697
For you and for our smelly
child, I'll get over it.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:14.621 --> 07:16.714
Are you ready to make water
your friend again?

07:16.762 --> 07:20.163
You sure this is the right thing
to do? Dr. Ellie's divorced.

07:20.199 --> 07:22.032
She doesn't get everything right.

07:22.084 --> 07:25.218
Mommy's gonna be with you
every step of the way.

07:25.304 --> 07:27.054
There you are, Taylor.

07:27.139 --> 07:28.722
Marigold has not stopped talking

07:28.807 --> 07:30.624
about how much fun she had
with you yesterday.

07:30.709 --> 07:33.226
Yeah? Did she tell you that
as a knock-knock joke?

07:33.312 --> 07:34.878
Guess how many I heard yesterday.

07:34.947 --> 07:36.830
Knock-knock! 6,000.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.582
That sounds like Marigold.

07:38.634 --> 07:39.750
- So, I was thinking...
- I gotta go.

07:39.802 --> 07:41.935
Marigold, look.
Taylor's playing tag with you.

07:42.021 --> 07:44.271
And you're it. Go get her.

07:44.356 --> 07:45.906
I never thought I would say this,

07:45.991 --> 07:48.125
but I love how you're taking
advantage of my daughter.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.277
Taylor really needs to learn
to stand up for herself.

07:50.362 --> 07:52.062
I know. She's a bully's dream.

07:52.131 --> 07:53.497
- Mm-hmm.
- And pretty, too.

07:53.549 --> 07:56.767
It always feel better
to break the hot ones.

08:03.392 --> 08:05.842
Tommy Bahama is never the answer, Dad.

08:05.911 --> 08:07.361
It's 90% silk.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.513
And it's sweet you think
that's a good thing.

08:10.182 --> 08:12.165
I have a plan to help you
with your jalapeño rating.

08:12.234 --> 08:14.017
It's vests.

08:14.069 --> 08:15.702
It's not vests.

08:15.771 --> 08:17.671
Come on.

08:17.756 --> 08:20.457
Here we are.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.393
The water won't kill you.
I won't let it.

08:23.479 --> 08:26.029
That's what they said about
the passengers on the Slocum

08:26.081 --> 08:27.214
right before they found out

08:27.299 --> 08:29.516
their life jackets
were filled with sawdust.

08:29.601 --> 08:31.101
They filled them with sawdust?

08:31.186 --> 08:32.986
And metal. To save money.

08:33.072 --> 08:35.839
Oh, God. Why couldn't you just
read Berenstain Bears?

08:35.874 --> 08:37.340
All right.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.976
Just a toe. Here we go.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.165
See? Not so bad.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.800
Not so bad.

08:46.885 --> 08:48.552
Now just a little bit more.

08:50.522 --> 08:52.355
Still not dead!

08:52.441 --> 08:55.542
One more step.

08:55.627 --> 08:59.096
I think I can go all the way in,
if you come with me.

09:00.616 --> 09:02.032
All right.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.118
<i>Dear, sweet, forgiving cover-up,</i>

09:05.204 --> 09:07.771
<i>I'm afraid this is where
we say "goodbye."</i>

09:07.806 --> 09:10.323
Katie? Katie Otto?

09:10.409 --> 09:12.275
We never see you in the pool.

09:14.697 --> 09:17.414
<i>Oh, God. Look at them.</i>

09:17.499 --> 09:19.766
<i>They've never eaten a
French-toast stick in their life.</i>

09:19.852 --> 09:23.620
Why don't you go in first
and show me how fun it is?

09:23.656 --> 09:25.756
No! I'm only doing it with you.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.391
<i>Come on, Katie.</i>

09:27.426 --> 09:29.976
<i>Why are you letting these
skinny idiots psych you out?</i>

09:30.062 --> 09:32.279
<i>Just take the stupid cover-up off</i>

09:32.364 --> 09:34.031
<i>and get your well-rounded ass
in the pool!</i>

09:36.468 --> 09:38.969
<i>Nope! Maybe tomorrow.</i>

09:39.004 --> 09:41.605
My cover-up got right to the point

09:41.657 --> 09:43.240
where my thighs meet,
and then I chickened out.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.509
I'm mad at myself for
letting Anna-Kat down

09:45.544 --> 09:47.928
but even madder for letting those
clavicle moms get in my head.

09:48.013 --> 09:49.146
Clavicle moms?

09:49.231 --> 09:51.615
This... is supposed to
be covered in meat!

09:51.667 --> 09:52.866
Okay.

09:52.951 --> 09:54.951
Well, getting into your head
is what those women do.

09:55.037 --> 09:56.386
They hate being in their own heads.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.804
It's all Botox and daddy issues.

09:57.890 --> 10:01.208
Mm. They convinced me to use
organic makeup last summer. Dumb.

10:01.293 --> 10:05.036
And I want to get in the pool.
I love being in the pool.

10:05.122 --> 10:06.596
But it's the unveiling.

10:06.682 --> 10:07.970
- Ugh.
- Ugh. It's the worst!

10:08.048 --> 10:08.899
Totally.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.417
Mnh-mnh. Don't try to get in on this.

10:10.502 --> 10:11.835
You two weigh less than my left boob.

10:13.172 --> 10:14.971
And it's the walk to the pool
that I hate.

10:15.007 --> 10:16.573
You're in nothing but a swimsuit,

10:16.608 --> 10:18.658
and everyone is watching
every jiggle and shake.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.210
Hmm.

10:20.295 --> 10:21.928
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just being crazy.

10:23.148 --> 10:25.649
Uh, you're not being crazy.
They're totally judging you.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.033
It makes them feel better

10:27.119 --> 10:28.785
- about their meaningless life choices.
- Mm-hmm.

10:28.871 --> 10:31.421
The point is, you just got
to sack up and get past it

10:31.473 --> 10:35.142
because Anna-Kat's stink is
starting to become your stink.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.160
Oh, yeah.

10:37.229 --> 10:39.312
That's what that is.

10:46.388 --> 10:47.387
Anything?

10:47.473 --> 10:50.357
It's worse than I expected. Total loss.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.959
Everything is too conservative
and out-of-date.

10:53.045 --> 10:54.077
What about the turtlenecks?

10:54.129 --> 10:55.595
Oh, Dad.

10:55.681 --> 10:57.230
Under a suit coat, they look sharp.

10:57.316 --> 11:01.451
Do you want 1.5 jalapeños for
the rest of your life? Do you?!

11:01.537 --> 11:02.836
No.

11:02.921 --> 11:05.388
Okay. Good.

11:05.441 --> 11:07.023
Sorry I had to raise my voice.

11:09.161 --> 11:11.661
Look at my outfit. Nice, right?

11:11.697 --> 11:14.181
Keep in mind we're working
with the same budget.

11:14.266 --> 11:15.599
That's true. How do you do it?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.686
All you need is one piece
of good clothing

11:17.780 --> 11:18.852
to build an outfit around.

11:18.937 --> 11:20.203
You mean like...

11:21.490 --> 11:22.672
...this?

11:22.708 --> 11:24.508
Stop!

11:24.543 --> 11:25.625
Listen.

11:25.711 --> 11:27.727
If you have a Picasso
hanging on your wall,

11:27.813 --> 11:30.730
everyone just assumes the rest
of the art is equally priceless.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.532
- Huh.
- See?

11:32.618 --> 11:34.284
I got this expensive shirt,

11:34.369 --> 11:38.021
which offsets these outlet pants
and discount-bin sneakers.

11:38.056 --> 11:41.358
You're right. That shirt
makes the whole outfit sing.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.960
I took the liberty of using
a generous gift card

11:43.996 --> 11:46.012
from a birthday-party swag bag

11:46.098 --> 11:48.431
and bought you...

11:48.517 --> 11:51.034
...this.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.170
Oh, Oliver, thank you,

11:53.255 --> 11:55.088
but I really can't pull that off.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.107
Uh, I think you're gonna
have to return it.

11:57.142 --> 11:58.775
- No.
- No?

11:58.861 --> 12:01.595
No. You are wearing this jacket.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.847
You are going to turn around
your jalapeño rating...

12:03.932 --> 12:05.899
or else I am going to the kitchen

12:05.984 --> 12:07.651
to eat your good almonds.

12:07.736 --> 12:09.669
No!

12:11.757 --> 12:15.225
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- No.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.111
- How do you do that?
- What?

12:18.197 --> 12:19.579
Say "no" to people like that.

12:19.665 --> 12:22.165
Doris is totally gonna stick me
with Marigold again.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.917
Teach me how to be a jerk like you.

12:24.002 --> 12:26.052
First of all, I'm not a jerk.

12:26.138 --> 12:27.854
I'm more like a lovable scamp.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.307
Second, see this thing right here?

12:30.392 --> 12:32.275
Yeah. Talk to that.

12:32.327 --> 12:34.744
It appears you're looking in
their eyes, but you're not,

12:34.780 --> 12:37.030
so you can't tell if they're
hurt or mad or anything.

12:37.115 --> 12:38.665
You just say whatever you want.

12:38.750 --> 12:39.749
And that works?

12:39.835 --> 12:41.668
With everyone but Mom.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.303
She's the only person in the world

12:43.388 --> 12:45.739
who cares less about
people's feelings than I do.

12:48.527 --> 12:51.461
Ooh! Garment bag. Fancy.

12:51.496 --> 12:53.380
Yeah. Oliver used some gift card
to buy me a jacket.

12:53.465 --> 12:55.465
I think he's trying to
improve my jalapeño score.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.467
- Let me see it.
- Yeah, here.

12:59.471 --> 13:01.238
Whoa!

13:01.273 --> 13:03.573
It's like Ryan Gosling, but a jacket.

13:03.659 --> 13:04.958
I know, right?

13:05.043 --> 13:08.011
But... I can't wear it.
It's really not my style.

13:08.046 --> 13:09.346
What do you mean?

13:09.381 --> 13:11.681
Because it's not the color
and texture of twigs?

13:11.767 --> 13:13.900
- Hey!
- Get over yourself and put it on.

13:13.986 --> 13:16.519
- Hmm.
- Mom! We have a problem.

13:16.605 --> 13:19.356
I tried to comb Anna-Kat's hair,
and the brush got stuck.

13:21.193 --> 13:22.792
Her hair is all matted.

13:22.828 --> 13:24.544
You didn't take her to the pool.

13:24.630 --> 13:25.378
I'm going to.

13:25.464 --> 13:26.846
She's growing dreadlocks!

13:26.932 --> 13:28.515
People will think
we're neglectful parents

13:28.600 --> 13:30.383
or, worse, that we want our kids
to have dreadlocks!

13:30.469 --> 13:32.852
Tomorrow, I'll take her to
the community pool in Norwalk.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.881
For 5 bucks, you can
use the pool all day.

13:34.951 --> 13:36.356
Yeah, and they throw in
pinkeye for free.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.607
Why are you being like that?

13:37.693 --> 13:39.326
Because I'm supposed to get over
wearing this jacket,

13:39.411 --> 13:40.827
but you can't get over
wearing a bathing suit

13:40.913 --> 13:42.245
to help our daughter de-stank?

13:42.281 --> 13:43.947
She's not that dirty.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.750
I don't even remember eating rice.

13:47.836 --> 13:49.619
Look at this.

13:49.671 --> 13:52.289
Look at what this family has become.

13:52.341 --> 13:53.957
You're all going to the pool tomorrow.

13:54.009 --> 13:55.292
You're wearing that jacket.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.845
You're wearing that bathing suit
so she gets in that pool!

13:58.931 --> 14:00.597
And you want me to
stand up to Doris, right?

14:00.632 --> 14:03.133
I don't care what you do.
But the rest of you,

14:03.218 --> 14:06.303
I'm trying to make connections,
secure internships,

14:06.388 --> 14:09.139
and you're pulling me down
like three crazy anchors.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.691
Just like Lena Ackerman
was pulled down with the Slocum

14:11.777 --> 14:14.311
when the water of the East River
claimed her as its own.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.397
Okay. Enough of that.
Tomorrow, we go in the pool.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.483
And, by the way,
you're not so normal, either.

14:20.535 --> 14:22.406
When you were 7 years old,

14:22.477 --> 14:24.321
you were obsessed with seeing me naked.

14:31.018 --> 14:34.781
<i>Today, we are showing this club
what the Ottos are made of.</i>

14:39.814 --> 14:43.033
<i>Whenever we're walking
as a group like this,</i>

14:43.111 --> 14:45.412
<i>I like to imagine
we're doing it in slo-mo.</i>

14:45.490 --> 14:47.457
<i>I think we look really cool,</i>

14:47.482 --> 14:48.948
<i>but other people probably just think,</i>

14:48.984 --> 14:51.751
<i>"Man, they sure bring
a lot of crap to the pool."</i>

14:54.923 --> 14:56.289
Okay, we'll see you at the pool.

14:58.677 --> 15:01.144
All right, Taylor.
Looks like you're up first.

15:01.213 --> 15:04.799
There will be people like Doris
out there your entire life.

15:04.869 --> 15:07.650
- Don't worry, Mom. I got this down.
- Hey, guys!

15:07.736 --> 15:09.702
Hi, Doris. Marigold.

15:09.754 --> 15:12.539
So, Marigold had such
a great time with you,

15:12.591 --> 15:15.308
we were thinking a sleepover
may be in order for you gals!

15:15.393 --> 15:16.526
Uh-huh.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.995
Uh, you can gossip,
she can braid your hair.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.280
But don't braid her hair.

15:20.332 --> 15:21.497
And apply her ointment at 6:00.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.082
And here's her overnight bag...

15:23.134 --> 15:24.217
No.

15:24.302 --> 15:25.518
Excuse me?

15:25.554 --> 15:27.353
You can't keep bullying me
into babysitting your kid!

15:27.405 --> 15:28.855
But you're best friends.

15:28.907 --> 15:31.491
No, we're not. She's like
7 years younger than me.

15:31.543 --> 15:34.427
- Technically, I could be her mother.
- That's just not true.

15:34.462 --> 15:35.762
- But you said...
- No buts!

15:35.847 --> 15:37.614
You birthed her, you play with her!

15:37.699 --> 15:39.232
And a lip wax wouldn't kill you.

15:39.284 --> 15:40.500
All right. All right.

15:40.535 --> 15:41.868
Let's just go ahead and break it up.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.202
Marigold, you come with me.

15:43.288 --> 15:46.005
I don't want you hanging around
with her anymore.

15:46.057 --> 15:49.475
Wow! Honey! You did it!

15:49.527 --> 15:51.477
And you also just made
a very powerful enemy.

15:51.529 --> 15:54.047
I don't care. I love the new me.

15:54.082 --> 15:57.300
I'm gonna tell Emma's under-nose
that she sucks at tennis.

15:59.137 --> 16:00.770
I don't think I can do this.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.038
Come on.

16:05.043 --> 16:07.126
The only jackets I've ever worn
have been part of a suit

16:07.198 --> 16:08.297
or a classic blue blazer.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.897
Without matching slacks,
this feels... unsafe.

16:12.183 --> 16:13.783
Let me tell you a story.

16:13.868 --> 16:16.486
You remember when we first moved
to Westport,

16:16.571 --> 16:18.321
and I was going through that...

16:18.390 --> 16:19.907
...Harry Potter phase?

16:19.992 --> 16:22.525
I remember a lot of robes
getting caught in car doors.

16:22.611 --> 16:24.644
Then Mom bought me
that pair of red pants.

16:24.696 --> 16:26.746
I felt like a complete idiot
wearing them.

16:26.781 --> 16:29.132
And yet you had no problem wearing
the Sorting Hat to school.

16:29.217 --> 16:32.352
The point is, look at me now.
The pants worked.

16:32.387 --> 16:34.687
Now you go make that jacket work.

16:34.723 --> 16:35.888
Thanks, Dad.

16:54.009 --> 16:55.975
Did you see me?! I crushed it!

16:56.061 --> 16:57.977
I went out there, and heads turned.

16:58.029 --> 17:00.246
You did great. Place is abuzz.

17:03.585 --> 17:05.435
Don't look back. Play it cool.

17:06.604 --> 17:09.188
Crushed it.

17:09.273 --> 17:10.406
Here's the plan.

17:10.492 --> 17:14.127
We are going to get in
and get over ourselves.

17:14.179 --> 17:16.262
Okay.

17:22.921 --> 17:24.037
<i>Coast is clear.</i>

17:29.527 --> 17:31.577
Everyone's got to shower!

17:31.613 --> 17:32.945
What?!

17:32.997 --> 17:35.548
Everyone has to shower
before getting in the pool.

17:36.551 --> 17:38.000
Well, that's stupid!

17:42.774 --> 17:45.058
<i>If Taylor can stand up to Doris</i>

17:45.143 --> 17:46.726
<i>and Greg can wear that ridiculous jacket</i>

17:46.778 --> 17:48.644
<i>that I'm pretending he can pull off,</i>

17:48.730 --> 17:50.296
<i>then I can do this.</i>

17:50.331 --> 17:52.165
<i>I've got nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

17:52.217 --> 17:53.966
<i>But if I'm being totally honest,</i>

17:54.002 --> 17:56.469
<i>I'm a little ashamed
of Greg in that jacket.</i>

17:56.521 --> 18:00.106
Okay, honey, we're gonna
do this together.

18:00.191 --> 18:02.158
Together.

18:21.913 --> 18:23.346
I don't think I can do it.

18:23.431 --> 18:27.350
Baby, we've come all this way.
We're not giving up now.

18:27.435 --> 18:31.070
If I don't jump in right now,
I don't think I ever will.

18:31.122 --> 18:33.239
Screw it.

18:34.542 --> 18:38.795
One, two, three!

18:47.539 --> 18:48.905
Hey!

18:48.990 --> 18:51.214
- We did it!
- We did it!

18:52.343 --> 18:53.926
You're a rock star!

18:56.264 --> 18:58.931
<i>Why was I avoiding this?</i>

18:58.983 --> 19:01.984
<i>It feels so good, swimming
with my favorite child,</i>

19:02.070 --> 19:04.537
<i>laughing, not worried
about what anyone thinks.</i>

19:04.572 --> 19:05.988
<i>I got worked up for nothing.</i>

19:07.759 --> 19:08.875
You are banned from the pool!

19:08.960 --> 19:11.511
You are 16 years old! Shut up!

19:15.467 --> 19:19.018
I mean, who are they to judge me?

19:19.070 --> 19:21.270
Nobody should judge anyone.

19:21.356 --> 19:24.757
Plus, my face is
so much better than theirs.

19:31.666 --> 19:34.550
Honey, I am so proud of you
for getting in the water!

19:34.636 --> 19:36.419
Thanks, Mama. I'm glad I did it.

19:36.504 --> 19:38.304
I was really starting
to stink this morning.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.556
Yeah. We went from B.O. to petting zoo.

19:40.642 --> 19:42.758
I'm going to go take a shower.

19:42.844 --> 19:45.561
Great. But first,
run these down to the wash.

19:45.647 --> 19:47.180
You mean in the basement?

19:47.265 --> 19:49.899
Yeah. That's where
the washing machine is.

19:49.984 --> 19:52.652
I can't down there!
The basement is underground!

19:52.687 --> 19:55.271
I could end up buried alive
like those Chilean miners!

19:55.356 --> 19:58.157
33 men trapped for over 2 months.

19:58.193 --> 20:00.409
They barely escaped with their lives!

20:00.495 --> 20:02.445
How do you know about that?

20:02.530 --> 20:04.197
I read it in my new book,

20:04.249 --> 20:06.866
"Trapped Below: Death in the Darkness."

20:08.036 --> 20:09.335
Greg!

20:09.370 --> 20:13.039
