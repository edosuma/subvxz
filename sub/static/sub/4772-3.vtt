"...barking, 'Dapper pups, dapper cuts'"?
Dave!

00:18.268 --> 00:20.270
-Good. Pineapple's so juicy.
-Yeah.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.814
-It really is!
-I love pineapple. It's great for juice.

00:22.898 --> 00:23.774
- Dave!
- Desserts.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.485
-Oh, shit.
-Where's Dave? Huh?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.987
- Out of the way!
- Oh! So sorry.

00:29.071 --> 00:29.988
I can see you, Dave.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.866
Hey, Lindsay.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.618
-How's my favorite reporter?
-Cut the crap.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.080
I pitched you a piece on the recent
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact,

00:38.163 --> 00:42.417
and instead you've assigned me
a puff piece on dog treats.

00:42.501 --> 00:46.713
Look, we're not <i>50 Minutes.</i>
We're local news, okay?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.757
How you guys doing?
Wendy keeping you in good shape?

00:48.840 --> 00:49.841
- Great!
- Come on.

00:49.925 --> 00:53.178
You need to let me do hard news.
Grow a set.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.932
Honey, we've done the research and
our viewers want to see your pretty face

00:57.015 --> 00:59.601
delivering the good news.
So, don't fight it.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.104
Sorry to interrupt.
There's a call for Lindsay on line three.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.355
- You're a sell-out, Dave.
- Okay.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.691
You're an incompetent sell-out.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.858
Great job!

01:06.942 --> 01:08.318
Nadine, you have that feature
about jeans yet?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.987
This is Lindsay.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.323
<i>Meet me in the garage </i>
<i>down the street in one hour.</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:14.616
Wait, who's this?

01:14.700 --> 01:18.287
<i>Do as I say and you might just expose</i>
<i>the biggest case of political corruption</i>

01:18.370 --> 01:20.038
<i>this country has ever seen.</i>

01:20.122 --> 01:21.790
<i>-Don't be late.</i>
-Wait, what's your name?

01:21.873 --> 01:25.168
<i>The parking garage down the street.</i>
<i>One hour. Be there.</i>

01:28.880 --> 01:31.550
Tell Dave he needs to stretch out
that aerobics piece

01:31.633 --> 01:34.177
because I'm following a real lead.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.441
These open houses are so nerve-wracking.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.360
You put so much time and energy into them
and then it's, like,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.237
is anybody even gonna show up?

01:52.321 --> 01:53.780
Just call it off, Beth.

01:53.864 --> 01:57.075
Don't sell this place.
It means too much to too many people.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.871
I can take you with me, Mitch.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.290
Hey, this camp means a lot to me too,
you know.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.502
Just because I fell into a large puddle
of toxic waste and was turned into a can

02:07.586 --> 02:09.463
doesn't mean I don't care anymore.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.505
I know that, Mitch.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.049
I know.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.509
-Hi!
-I saw the ''for sale" sign.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.969
Oh, yes, of course, of course.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.430
Uh, let me give you a tour
of the facilities.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.349
Oh, no! No, no, that won't be necessary.

02:20.432 --> 02:24.061
You see,
I represent a very motivated buyer.

02:24.144 --> 02:28.899
I've been authorized to make you an offer
I believe you'll find sufficient.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.319
Oh, my God!

02:33.320 --> 02:35.822
-You've got yourself a deal.
-Very good.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.159
I'll have the paperwork drawn and be back
within an hour with the cashier's check.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.119
-Pleasure doing business with you.
-And also with you.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.497
-May I use your phone for a second?
-Yes!

02:46.708 --> 02:50.003
Did you hear that, Mitch?
I'm gonna be rich!

02:50.087 --> 02:53.131
I'm gonna be rich! Rich!

02:53.215 --> 02:55.592
Everything went according to plan,
Mr. President.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.553
- <i>Good.</i>
- The camp is yours within an hour.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.138
<i>- Very good.</i>

03:01.640 --> 03:04.684
<i> We are slip slidin' </i>
<i>ever closer to high noon.</i>

03:04.768 --> 03:06.395
<i>Oh, hi, noon! </i>

03:06.478 --> 03:10.941
<i>And with the dance only 510 minutes away,</i>
<i>decorations must be made.</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:15.153
<i>So time to gather on the main lawn</i>
<i>for a carnival of craft making.</i>

03:15.237 --> 03:18.198
So take a handful of hay
and then dip it in the paint,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.325
and glue it onto one of these sticks.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.953
We need 50 hay sticks
for the dance tonight!

03:23.036 --> 03:24.329
Hello, hello, hello.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.082
Donna!

03:27.165 --> 03:28.500
I did not think we'd ever see you again

03:28.583 --> 03:31.461
after you left camp
the second day back in '81.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.922
Weren't you gonna go live out in a yurt
with that Israeli guy?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.383
-What was his name?
-Yaron.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.303
-Wow. You guys are still together?
-Yeah, we're still together, so...

03:40.387 --> 03:43.640
Whoa. Of course, we are still together.
We've been using our system.

03:43.724 --> 03:48.520
Donna and Yaron have made these videotapes
to help couples stay in love.

03:48.603 --> 03:52.315
- I brought my copy for you guys to sign.
- Oh, she did! She did bring it.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.735
- Yes!
- Oh, look at us.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.987
-Thank you.
-That's sweet. That's really sweet.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.574
But, yeah, we, you know,
we sort of uncovered the secret truths

04:00.657 --> 04:02.993
-of our early life's journeys.
-Early life's journey.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.121
We just felt that they were too important
to not share with other people.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.789
To share with, uh, others.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.168
But these secrets were just too good
to give up for nothing.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.212
- They were too good.
- So, it's $149.99 for the entire set.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.714
-And then there's tax and shipping.
-And then there's tax.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.966
But also this weekend,
friends and family discount,

04:19.050 --> 04:21.178
$79.99, and that includes
a rainy day handbook

04:21.261 --> 04:24.473
as well as a signed copy
of the poster, so...

04:24.556 --> 04:26.808
I... I brought all 16 volumes.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.894
- You go, girl!
- It's amazing.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.273
So what... what are some good tips
for keeping the passion alive?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.275
- Well, one of my favorites--
- Uh-uh...

04:35.358 --> 04:39.446
If you want the secrets to a passionate
and successful relationship,

04:39.529 --> 04:41.990
they're really easy to get.
It's just $79.99.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.451
Which is just this weekend only, so...

04:44.534 --> 04:46.953
But, uh, these people,
they are, uh, family to us.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.874
Yeah, I know, I know. And our families
also all bought the program,

04:50.957 --> 04:54.169
not because they were nice, but because
this system actually works, so...

04:54.252 --> 04:57.464
Donna...

05:10.977 --> 05:12.687
Yeah, I mean, basically, we...

05:12.771 --> 05:14.523
- The secret truths, it's...
- Whoa.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.029
You've been gone for ten years
and nothing's changed.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.829
Oh, hey! Look, it's Claire!

05:28.912 --> 05:30.997
Can I ask you something, J.J.?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.958
You can ask me anything.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.086
Um...

05:37.963 --> 05:41.591
Could you just... Um, the camera...
Put the camera... Put it down.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.510
-Sorry. What's up?
-Um...

05:44.928 --> 05:47.847
Well, I know this is gonna sound
totally crazy...

05:48.682 --> 05:53.436
but sometimes I get the feeling
that Mark is...

05:54.145 --> 05:56.022
I can't even believe I'm saying this...

05:57.023 --> 06:00.068
but, um, being unfaithful to me.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.699
If you knew anything,
you'd tell me, right?

06:05.782 --> 06:06.825
Absolutely.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.953
So, do you know anything?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.081
No, um, no. Sorry, no.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.959
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

06:16.042 --> 06:17.919
Do I not look sure?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.339
I'm sorry. You're right.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.133
I don't know what I was thinking.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.634
I just...

06:24.718 --> 06:27.304
Sometimes I just get crazy and stupid.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.307
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not stupid. You're the...

06:30.390 --> 06:32.309
You're very, very smart.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.769
Oh, there's Victor.
Will you excuse me? Victor!

06:38.857 --> 06:40.859
<i>And that concludes our closer look</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:44.321
<i>at the role intercourse can play</i>
<i>in a healthy relationship.</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:47.699
<i>This next exercise is called</i>
<i>the Plant of Trust.</i>

06:47.782 --> 06:49.367
<i>Let's practice. </i>

06:49.451 --> 06:52.579
<i>-I trust you with my heart.</i>
<i>-I trust you with my soul.</i>

06:52.662 --> 06:55.915
<i>-I trust you with my days.</i>
<i>-I trust you with my nights.</i>

06:55.999 --> 06:58.084
<i>I trust you with my finances.</i>

06:58.168 --> 07:01.630
<i>-I trust you with my medical pres...</i>
<i>-Prescription.</i>

07:01.713 --> 07:03.757
<i>-Prescript...</i>
<i>-Prescription.</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:07.844
Hey!

07:09.346 --> 07:11.181
Whoa. Rudy, slow down, man.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.475
You don't wanna be
the next Willie-Shits-His-Pants!

07:13.558 --> 07:15.769
Who's Willie-Shits-His-Pants?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.354
Seriously?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.356
It's like the oldest ghost story
in Firewood lore.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.815
- Tell it, douche.
- Yeah!

07:20.899 --> 07:22.317
- Please! Please!
- Okay!

07:22.400 --> 07:25.779
The year is 1921.

07:25.862 --> 07:30.742
It was the last day of summer
and the night of the big barn dance.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.621
All summer long, Willie had a huge crush
on this shy girl named Vivian.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.000
Oh, my God, they're telling the story
of Willie-Shits-His-Pants.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.211
Wow. Some things never change.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.880
So, Willie and Vivian are dancing.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.175
But all of a sudden, when everyone
in the camp was watching them,

07:47.258 --> 07:51.763
Willie fully fuckin' drops a deuce
right in his pants.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.641
- Ew.
- The dookie was so perfectly round

07:54.724 --> 07:56.601
that it rolled down his pants leg
and onto the floor.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.896
That is true.
It was a perfectly round dookie.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.856
Willie was so embarrassed,
he ran out into the night.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.192
And was never...

08:04.275 --> 08:05.276
seen...

08:05.360 --> 08:06.861
again!

08:10.240 --> 08:12.117
I smell a doo-doo.

08:25.255 --> 08:30.135
...ninety-nine, a hundred.
Give me some bug juice, dick weeds.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.720
- Hello.
- Hi, Vic.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.472
-Shalom, Victor.
-Oh, Donna.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.015
-Yeah.
-And, uh, Yaron.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.058
-Yaron.
-Yaron.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.102
- Ya...
- Yaron.

08:39.184 --> 08:43.023
-Victor, we've been watching you--
-Admiring you.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.316
-Yeah, observing you.
-Sussing you out.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.402
-Taking stock.
-You know, you're strong.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.404
-And healthy.
-Oh.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.366
Thanks. Do you... do you guys need help
moving a couch or something?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.118
Not moving a couch.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.871
Making a life.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.459
It's total bull crap
that Beth wants to sell the camp.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.712
I know. So some guy is just gonna
pay her straight cash for this place?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.921
Sounds fishy to me.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.049
That old man
knocked over your bug juice, Betsy!

09:09.132 --> 09:10.925
I wish we could buy the camp.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.261
But I certainly don't have
that type of coin laying around.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.181
I know. It makes me so mad.
I just... I wanna hit something!

09:17.307 --> 09:18.391
Fuck!

09:18.475 --> 09:19.350
Wait!

09:19.934 --> 09:22.395
I know who might have the money.
But we don't have much time.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.272
Who is really good at windsurfing?

09:27.859 --> 09:28.985
Me.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.704
Good thing these guys
are having their reunion, too.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.663
Yeah.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.124
- I hope this works.
- It will.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.629
Remember, our camps have been allies
since the 1978 Accord of Lake Winnisuki.

09:49.672 --> 09:53.218
I can't stand these preppy doinks
and their fake waterfall.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.555
How do you know Blake's gonna be here?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.475
Our parents still vacation together
on the Vineyard.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.560
Katie?

10:03.353 --> 10:06.022
Katie Finnerty.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.899
As I live and breathe.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.610
Okay.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.153
Well, welcome to Tigerclaw.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.906
Hi, Courtney.
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.742
Well, you are a little bit.
My recital's about to start.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.536
Why don't you watch?

10:38.221 --> 10:40.974
She's... she's really gotten better.

10:47.021 --> 10:50.275
Well, if it isn't
the old Camp Firewood gang.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.485
Goodness gracious. Me, oh, my.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.612
Katie, you look as stunning as ever.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.825
Andy, my old dance partner.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.996
That is one heck of a goatee
you're sporting.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.248
I know.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.376
Long time no see, old friends.
What brings you to our side of the lake?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.717
We, uh, want to talk to you
about something.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.928
It's important.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.805
Hmm.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.934
Important, you say? I see. Hmm.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.775
Victor, we have something...

11:32.859 --> 11:35.987
uh, to... to ask you,
to talk to you about.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.197
-Okay.
-Uh, a proposition sort.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.867
- What was that?
- It's...

11:40.950 --> 11:43.286
It's a proposition of sorts.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.579
-That's what he said?
-Yeah.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.416
Victor, Donna and I wish to have a child.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.128
But my seed, it is, uh...
like the Midbar Yehuda.

11:52.211 --> 11:57.592
It is, uh, arid, harsh...
lifeless.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.801
-Victor?
-Yeah?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.846
We want you to be our sperm donor.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.643
Oh! Oh. Oh, you guys are going to do
artificial insemination?

12:06.726 --> 12:11.397
No, there's... there's no time for
a clinical procedure...

12:11.481 --> 12:13.733
'cause I'm ovulating
right this very moment.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.778
Victor, if we are going to have our baby,

12:17.362 --> 12:23.076
we need you to have intercourse
with Donna tonight.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.291
You think about it.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.338
Come on. Okay. Good. Okay.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.758
Bye-bye now.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.280
- Is that you?
- Keep your voice down.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.867
- Is someone listening?
- You can never be too careful.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.203
Listen, there's something going on,
and I need you to--

13:07.286 --> 13:08.955
All right, Joan,
where the hell is the car?

13:09.038 --> 13:12.291
I told you, it's not in this section.
You never listen to me.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.795
No, I remember. B2.
I swear to God. I swear to God.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.463
I brought you here to tell you

13:17.547 --> 13:20.633
that there's a conspiracy
involving very evil forces.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.968
I have a photographic memory.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.303
Shit! They're coming back.
Listen, hold on.

13:24.387 --> 13:28.224
I remember telling you to remember
where we parked the goddamn LeSabre!

13:28.307 --> 13:32.812
Okay, okay. We don't need
to get sarcastic. We're on the same team.

13:32.895 --> 13:33.938
This goes much deep--

13:34.022 --> 13:35.732
You know what?
They're... they're circling back.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.775
God damn it. This is ridic--

13:37.859 --> 13:39.402
You know what? I'll write it down.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.279
You take a picture
with your photographic memory,

13:41.362 --> 13:43.740
and then I'll take a cyanide pill.
How about that, huh?

13:43.823 --> 13:47.618
Christ! Just check P3.
Or go ask the parking attendant?

13:47.702 --> 13:50.038
Excuse you, mister!

13:50.121 --> 13:51.831
-Butt out, buddy.
-Jesus!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.418
Go to this address.
All your questions will be answered.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.586
But why me?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.297
When you find the answer,
you'll know why I chose you.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.137
- What color's the damn car, Joan?
- Burgundy!

14:06.220 --> 14:09.348
- Burgundy? It's maroon!
- No, that's different.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.893
I don't wanna a fight.
I just wanna get home.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.770
I wanna go home!

14:31.537 --> 14:34.874
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.960
I am not a cat,
and I did not drag them in.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.338
These guests graced us
of their own accord.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.802
Fleckner, how long has it been,
for goodness' sake?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.179
- As long as my greasy dick.
- Ha!

14:48.262 --> 14:50.640
Very good. Katie, how are your parents?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.810
Last I heard, they were changing
their tennis court from grass to clay.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.521
Oh, yes, their second serve
has a lot more bite now.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.939
Hmm.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.067
Uh, guys, I am about to harmonize.
Who's coming?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.861
Oh, poodles!
We're talking shop.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.323
Oh, poo! Well, do come join the fun
when you're done.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.160
It was nice seeing you two.
Enjoy the grouse.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.914
Whitney, you dumb bitch, put that down.

15:14.997 --> 15:19.252
-Now, you said you had important business.
-We do. We have a favor to ask you.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.212
An outsider is trying to buy
Camp Firewood,

15:21.295 --> 15:24.841
and we want to protect the camp
from outside investors.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.677
Which is why
we want you to beat her offer.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.221
We want Tigerclaw to buy Camp Firewood.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.350
Well, that certainly is a favor.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.397
Hey, look, man, I know we've had
our differences in the past--

15:39.480 --> 15:41.190
Our differences are exactly that.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.359
In the past.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.528
Tigerclaw and Firewood share
more than a lake.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.571
We share a common history.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.323
We are each other's yin and yang.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.285
Fire and ice. Fresca and Squirt.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.328
This buyer you speak of
is coming for your camp today,

15:54.412 --> 15:57.874
but they'll come for ours tomorrow,
itching to build B. Dalton Booksellers

15:57.957 --> 16:01.961
or a Circuit City
or a Blockburster Verdio.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.631
Now more than ever,
we need to stick together.

16:08.885 --> 16:09.760
Give us a moment.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.443
<i>♪ Come on, everybody ♪</i>

16:26.486 --> 16:27.612
<i>♪ Come on, everybody ♪</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:37.997
This feels right. You know,
you and me trying to save the camp.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.166
Yeah, and that's all we're doing.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.753
We could do more,
like with our tongues and butts.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.213
Andy, I want to be clear with you.

16:45.296 --> 16:48.799
I'm 26, and maybe it was a different story
when I was 16,

16:48.883 --> 16:51.928
but right now,
I am all about long-term commitment.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.513
So you wanna fuck?

16:53.596 --> 16:55.765
-No, just friends.
-Yeah, friends that fuck.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.225
No, just friends.

16:57.892 --> 16:58.726
Whatever.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.353
We have arrived at our decision.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.482
Let's go save Camp Firewood.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.321
And here is your cashier's check.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.367
All you need to do is sign
right there on the contract

17:14.450 --> 17:16.410
and our business is done.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.162
Well, all good things must end, right?

17:19.497 --> 17:20.498
Goodbye, Firewood.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.751
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Katie!

17:24.627 --> 17:26.671
What are they doing here?

17:26.753 --> 17:28.881
We'd like to put in an offer
to buy Camp Firewood.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.134
Absolutely not!
We have a verbal agreement.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.928
Beth, listen to Blake.
Just give them a chance.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.973
Look, we don't have ten million dollars
to throw in your face, Beth.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.184
But we can offer something she cannot.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.310
Peace of mind.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.479
The peace of mind
that comes with knowing

17:43.563 --> 17:45.648
you'll leave Firewood
with your legacy intact.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.568
You know what people like her do
with summer camps, Beth?

17:49.944 --> 17:51.654
They turn them into B. Dalton Booksellers.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.825
We can't let that happen, Beth.
You can't let that happen.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.868
Ms. Burkhart, what are you planning
to do with this camp?

17:57.952 --> 17:58.869
That's none of your business.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.079
-Oh!
-Bingo.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.956
You know what our plans are
for Camp Firewood?

18:03.040 --> 18:03.958
Graham, show Beth the plans.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.170
There's nothing on it.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.716
That's because we're not planning
on changing a thing.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.509
It's perfect just the way it is.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.178
We'll keep everything here the same
as it's been since time immemorial.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.764
We make a solemn Tigerclaw oath.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.226
Tigerclaw true salute.
Sun to moon, lips are mute.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.561
Tiger growl!

18:27.315 --> 18:31.402
Wow. That was a real impressive pitch
from you guys.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.945
Yet we still haven't heard a number.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.369
That's our first, best, and last offer.
We pray it is sufficient.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.762
-You know what to do.
-Yeah.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.472
You got yourself a deal, Blake.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.605
-You'll regret this.
-Bye-bye now!

19:50.523 --> 19:51.732
- Walk out.
- Bye-bye.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.402
We'll arrange for the transfer
of the money this afternoon.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.154
Oh, thank you so much.
You've saved the spirit of Camp Firewood.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.280
Thank you.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.645
Hmm.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.833
Sir, I don't know what happened.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.294
Your offer was a hundred times better,

20:53.377 --> 20:57.715
but she went with the other guys because
she wanted the camp to stay the same.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.842
I failed you, Mr. President.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.720
I'd like to offer you my resignation.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.724
Well, there's no need for that.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.311
Those Firewood rubes did exactly
what you said they'd do, Mr. President.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.772
You? I can't believe
I didn't see you there.

21:13.731 --> 21:14.565
They're in on it?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.567
I knew those old junior counselors

21:16.650 --> 21:19.403
wouldn't let me buy Firewood off
with money.

21:19.487 --> 21:23.365
So I gave them something they value
more than anything else in the world.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.578
The childish belief
that they actually make a difference.

21:29.830 --> 21:34.001
And I saved $9,900,000.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.963
Firewood is mine!

21:45.137 --> 21:47.097
Yes!

21:50.059 --> 21:51.519
Oh, my God.

21:52.937 --> 21:53.979
Did you hear something?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.484
Well, don't just sit there, you imbeciles!

21:58.567 --> 21:59.944
Get him!

22:28.556 --> 22:31.433
-Looks like your luck ran out.
-Nowhere to go now.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.686
I'm not so sure.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.356
Ha! You'd never make it alive.
That's a 50-foot drop.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.524
You're a dead man.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.570
I'll take my chances.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.164
No one could survive a jump
from that height.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.624
Let's get out of here.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.252
We don't need to wait another 30 seconds
to see what happens.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.847
I'm alive!

23:11.056 --> 23:13.058
I'm alive!
