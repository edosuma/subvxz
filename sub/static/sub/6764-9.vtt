02:46.379 --> 02:47.539
Hi, Brandon.

02:47.714 --> 02:51.411
- Hi, you're late.
- So?

02:51.585 --> 02:54.019
So l thought you said you got here
at 7:00 every morning.

02:54.187 --> 02:56.087
l was beginning to think
you weren't gonna show.

02:56.256 --> 02:58.383
Oh, l didn't think
l was being clocked.

02:58.558 --> 03:00.025
A little eager, aren't we?

03:00.193 --> 03:03.026
Well, my father always told me never
to keep a beautiful woman waiting.

03:03.530 --> 03:07.057
Well, in that case,
are you ready to start sweating?

03:07.567 --> 03:09.159
You can work me
as hard as you want.

03:09.669 --> 03:12.137
Yeah, l was hoping you'd say that.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.605
Yeah.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.494
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

03:36.663 --> 03:37.891
Hi,

03:38.064 --> 03:40.123
I was just Iooking at my ring,

03:40.300 --> 03:41.631
Yeah, do you still like it?

03:41.801 --> 03:43.894
l love it.

03:44.504 --> 03:46.096
Do you still like me?

03:46.273 --> 03:48.468
- Stuart,
- Well?

03:48.642 --> 03:51.770
Of course. l love you.

03:53.413 --> 03:54.675
Good.

03:54.848 --> 03:56.247
Then you get to have lunch with me.

03:56.416 --> 03:59.874
TweIve-thirty, corner of
SepuIveda Pass and MuIhoIIand,

04:00.353 --> 04:03.550
lt's a construction site.
So dress for the occasion.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.215
l'll wear my hardhat.

04:06.393 --> 04:07.883
Bye.

04:12.299 --> 04:15.291
Remind me why we had children.

04:15.468 --> 04:17.766
Jim, what if she's pregnant?

04:17.938 --> 04:19.565
No, absolutely not.

04:19.738 --> 04:22.367
lf it was something like that,
she would tell us.

04:23.209 --> 04:25.507
Who gets engaged at 1 8,
in this day and age?

04:25.679 --> 04:28.580
- Good morning.
- Brenda, are you pregnant?

04:28.748 --> 04:32.275
Daddy, l'm not even gonna dignify that
with an answer.

04:32.452 --> 04:34.283
Come on, you guys,
just be happy for me.

04:34.454 --> 04:36.422
Honey, just try to understand.

04:36.590 --> 04:38.683
You and Stuart haven't known
each other for very long.

04:38.858 --> 04:40.519
Marriage is a big step.

04:40.694 --> 04:43.094
We just don't want you to get hurt.

04:43.263 --> 04:46.255
Honey, you're young,
your youth is calling out to you.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.867
You don't see Stuart
for who he really is,

04:49.035 --> 04:51.094
what his little imperfections
might be.

04:51.938 --> 04:53.132
Well, nobody's perfect.

04:53.306 --> 04:54.864
Honey, what's the rush?

04:55.041 --> 04:57.771
lf it's good now, why won't it be good
six months from now?

04:57.944 --> 05:00.344
Look, l am not going to get hurt.

05:00.513 --> 05:01.980
So please stop.

05:02.148 --> 05:04.981
l know what l'm doing.
lt's gonna be fine, l promise.

05:08.054 --> 05:09.282
Thank you for understanding.

05:09.456 --> 05:11.583
And thank you for everything, really.

05:11.758 --> 05:15.717
But l gotta go meet the girls
for breakfast.

05:15.895 --> 05:18.989
lt's gonna be okay.
Promise, lt will be.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.903
Somehow l didn't find that
very reassuring.

05:26.406 --> 05:28.499
So you sure l can't buy you
that cup of coffee?

05:28.675 --> 05:30.666
No, l gotta get in gear.
The library's calling.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.312
Somehow l have trouble seeing you
as an academic.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.277
You're not stuffy enough.

05:35.448 --> 05:37.439
Yeah, l guess you don't realize
that anthropologists

05:37.617 --> 05:39.209
are the free spirits of academia.

05:39.386 --> 05:41.684
Maybe l should change my major.

05:41.855 --> 05:44.949
Listen, l was wondering,

05:45.125 --> 05:46.990
how'd you like to come over
to my place tonight?

05:47.794 --> 05:50.456
You know, a little dinner,
some conversation?

05:51.131 --> 05:53.031
Food and words. What a concept.

05:53.199 --> 05:55.997
Expression is very important to me.

05:56.169 --> 06:01.232
Of course, like the Aborigines,
l'm a firm believer in body language.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.399
Fortunately, l'm fluent in Aborigine.

06:04.277 --> 06:06.472
Come around 7:30.
322 Hope Street.

06:06.646 --> 06:08.705
The green house, can't miss it.

06:09.149 --> 06:10.946
Okay.

06:16.923 --> 06:18.891
Bren, that is not a ring, that is a rock.

06:19.059 --> 06:21.653
Oh, it's not that big, you guys.

06:21.828 --> 06:23.557
Brenda, honey,
let me put it to you this way:

06:23.730 --> 06:29.191
lf you and your fiance ever wanna
buy a diner, be sure to look me up.

06:29.369 --> 06:31.837
- Have you guys set the date yet?
- Hardly, no.

06:32.005 --> 06:33.438
And if my parents have it their way,

06:33.606 --> 06:36.734
the wedding will be held sometime
in the year, what, 201 6.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.470
You know, l always thought
you would be the first to get engaged.

06:39.646 --> 06:43.343
Me? See, l had my money on you.

06:43.516 --> 06:45.882
No, if there's one thing
that l've learned from my mother,

06:46.052 --> 06:48.384
it's that marriage
is not to be entered into lightly.

06:48.555 --> 06:49.988
Oh, so l guess that explains

06:50.156 --> 06:52.351
your prolonged engagement
to John Sears.

06:52.525 --> 06:54.823
Donna, l would hardly call it
an engagement.

06:54.994 --> 06:56.291
We haven't actually gone out yet.

06:56.463 --> 06:58.863
And here, l thought you would have
something juicy to report.

06:59.032 --> 07:00.966
Sorry to disappoint you, Bren.

07:01.134 --> 07:02.863
But for once, l'm taking things slow.

07:03.036 --> 07:05.402
- And how does he feel about that?
- He's fine.

07:05.572 --> 07:09.406
l mean, he knows l'm just coming out
of a relationship and everything

07:09.576 --> 07:11.441
and he's not pressuring me.

07:11.611 --> 07:13.806
He's turning out to be
a pretty cool guy.

07:13.980 --> 07:17.381
Well, l bet you he's taking
lots of cold showers.

07:18.318 --> 07:20.149
Bren...

07:23.690 --> 07:25.089
- Sanders.
- What's up, man?

07:25.258 --> 07:27.385
- You missed the Gamma party.
- Well...

07:27.560 --> 07:29.391
lt was a wild night, man.
Should have seen it.

07:29.562 --> 07:32.998
Erica Standhouse
was crawling all over Sears.

07:33.166 --> 07:35.566
lt's a dirty job,
fortunately l'm a dirty guy.

07:37.570 --> 07:38.764
Who's Erica Standhouse?

07:38.938 --> 07:42.066
Just a little someone to tide me over
till Kelly Taylor gets her head together.

07:42.609 --> 07:44.440
So, Sanders,
remember l was telling you

07:44.611 --> 07:47.842
about that freshman from Clark Hall
who practically threw herself at me?

07:48.681 --> 07:52.014
Well, it turns out she's got a friend
who's dying to meet a KEG man.

07:53.686 --> 07:55.483
No, no, no.

07:55.655 --> 07:57.953
- Celeste would kill me.
- Oh, a little whipped are we?

07:58.458 --> 08:00.551
No, we have
an understanding, though.

08:00.727 --> 08:03.093
- So don't tell her.
- Look, from what l've been told,

08:03.263 --> 08:06.926
Deborah's friend is ready,
willing and able.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.660
Well, Celeste is suspicious,
perceptive and unforgiving.

08:09.836 --> 08:13.704
Oh, come on, Sanders.
Celeste doesn't go to school here.

08:13.873 --> 08:17.400
- She'll never know what you're doing.
- Believe me, she'll know.

08:17.577 --> 08:20.910
Wait a minute, hold it.
Am l hearing what l think l'm hearing?

08:21.080 --> 08:24.174
ls a lowly pledge refusing to come
to the aid of a brother in need?

08:24.350 --> 08:27.376
This is not a good thing, Sanders.

08:27.554 --> 08:28.919
She better not be a dog.

08:29.088 --> 08:30.646
l guarantee you,

08:30.824 --> 08:34.554
this will be the easiest
pledge assignment you'll ever get.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.597
Okay, this one's for your insurance.

08:42.769 --> 08:43.793
All right.

08:43.970 --> 08:47.633
This one's to give us permission
to roll over the bonds.

08:47.807 --> 08:50.332
This one allows you
to increase your draw.

08:50.510 --> 08:53.741
- Oh, l like this one.
- l thought you would.

08:54.981 --> 08:57.415
Okay, so that's it?

08:57.584 --> 08:59.745
- Pretty painless.
- Thank you.

08:59.919 --> 09:02.046
So where you headed this weekend?

09:02.222 --> 09:05.589
Oh, l don't know, l figured
l'd go to Baja. South swells up,

09:05.758 --> 09:07.453
soak up some rays,
soak up some enchiladas.

09:07.627 --> 09:11.063
But don't worry, no stowaways.
l'm not taking Brenda this time.

09:12.866 --> 09:16.097
To tell you the truth,
l kind of wish you were.

09:16.269 --> 09:19.796
Do l detect some cynicism from the
soon-to-be father of the bride?

09:19.973 --> 09:21.440
Tell me something.

09:21.608 --> 09:23.337
Do you know anything
about her fiance?

09:24.210 --> 09:25.939
A little.

09:26.112 --> 09:27.670
And?

09:28.915 --> 09:30.815
Let's just say,

09:30.984 --> 09:34.181
Stuart Carson is no choirboy,
and leave it at that.

09:34.988 --> 09:36.216
Care to elaborate?

09:37.156 --> 09:38.851
No.

09:39.893 --> 09:42.987
But you don't think that it's a good idea
that she's marrying this guy, do you?

09:43.162 --> 09:45.995
No, l don't think it's a good idea.
l think it's a lousy idea.

09:46.165 --> 09:48.633
l think your daughter's
out of her ever-loving mind.

09:48.801 --> 09:52.100
But my opinion
doesn't really count anymore, Jim.

09:52.272 --> 09:53.762
l don't think that's the case at all.

09:53.940 --> 09:57.467
ln fact, l think you underestimate
the influence you still have with her.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.042
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Jim.

10:01.214 --> 10:04.047
Are you--?
You're not trying to talk me into doing

10:04.217 --> 10:06.412
what it sounds like
you're trying to talk me into doing,

10:06.586 --> 10:09.749
because l'll tell you right now, l do not
want to get involved in this at all.

10:10.189 --> 10:12.623
Dylan, somebody's
gotta get through to her.

10:12.792 --> 10:15.158
She's not listening to me,
she's not listening to her mother.

10:15.328 --> 10:18.456
Right now, l'd say you're the only hope
that Cindy and l have.

10:25.939 --> 10:27.702
Thanks.

10:28.341 --> 10:30.605
Here she comes.

10:31.411 --> 10:34.346
You little monkey. You come here.

10:34.514 --> 10:36.982
- Erin.
- l throw it in the sand.

10:37.150 --> 10:39.175
You did?

10:39.352 --> 10:41.752
You know it's tough being a toddler,
isn't it?

10:41.921 --> 10:44.913
Yes, it's even harder being a parent.

10:45.091 --> 10:48.652
Go play. Which is why l asked you
to meet me here.

10:48.828 --> 10:50.261
What's the matter?

10:50.430 --> 10:53.627
l know l made a scene the other night
at the Walshes' anniversary party,

10:53.800 --> 10:56.530
but when l found out
that Mel went down to Cabo

10:56.703 --> 11:00.332
and left Erin with David and Donna,
l just lost it.

11:00.506 --> 11:03.475
Mom, l'm sure
that everybody understood.

11:03.643 --> 11:05.634
Well, l think you should know
that my lawyer and l

11:05.812 --> 11:09.179
have decided to take Mel to court
to get full custody of Erin.

11:09.849 --> 11:12.841
Mom, it was only one weekend.

11:13.186 --> 11:16.314
lsn't there any way
that you can settle this out of court?

11:16.489 --> 11:21.222
No, l want Erin to grow up in a healthy
and stable environment,

11:21.394 --> 11:22.861
and you and l both know
that right now

11:23.029 --> 11:25.589
the only thing Mel's interested in
is his girlfriend.

11:25.765 --> 11:28.427
l don't wanna make the same mistakes
with Erin that l made with you.

11:28.601 --> 11:30.262
She needs a full-time parent.

11:30.436 --> 11:33.132
Well, Mel did want
joint custody of her.

11:33.306 --> 11:37.367
Honey, that was about his ego,
not about his daughter.

11:39.779 --> 11:42.339
You know how much l care
about David.

11:42.515 --> 11:44.483
Yeah, l do too.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.982
Don't be surprised if things get
a little tense around there

11:47.153 --> 11:50.953
in the next few weeks.
After all, blood is thicker than water.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.716
l'm sure we will be fine.

11:53.626 --> 11:57.289
Okay, just remember
what your father used to say,

11:57.463 --> 12:01.900
''Hope for the best, but don't forget
to be prepared for the worst.''

12:06.205 --> 12:07.229
Just a minute.

12:11.277 --> 12:14.007
Hi, they told me downstairs
l could find David Silver up here.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.774
- Sure, can l tell him who's here?
- Just tell him it's Jerry.

12:16.949 --> 12:19.110
Okay. David, Jerry's here.

12:19.285 --> 12:21.412
l don't know any Jerry.

12:21.954 --> 12:24.787
Well, he's standing here at the door.

12:24.957 --> 12:27.289
Just one second, okay?

12:32.265 --> 12:34.256
Hi, can l help you?

12:34.434 --> 12:36.527
- Are you David Silver?
- Yes, l am.

12:36.702 --> 12:39.102
Then this is for you, David.
Have a nice day.

12:39.272 --> 12:40.830
What is it?

12:41.007 --> 12:42.770
lt's a subpoena.

12:42.942 --> 12:45.342
Why are you being subpoenaed?

12:46.312 --> 12:49.179
l don't believe this. Jackie's bringing
a custody suit against my father.

12:49.348 --> 12:52.579
l've gotta give a deposition
to her lawyers.

12:53.653 --> 12:55.780
What's a deposition?

13:06.432 --> 13:08.525
Excuse me, do you know
where l can find Stuart Carson?

13:08.701 --> 13:11.397
- Yeah, behind the trailer.
- Thanks.

13:12.472 --> 13:14.235
Look, l'm not gonna take the blame
for you.

13:14.407 --> 13:16.898
You okayed that steel shipment
six weeks before you were ready

13:17.076 --> 13:18.703
and now it's gotta be paid for.

13:18.878 --> 13:21.438
Do you have idea how much interest
we're gonna lose on this money?

13:21.614 --> 13:23.514
Who do you think you are,
you little pissant?

13:23.683 --> 13:26.311
lf your father's got a problem
with the management on this project,

13:26.486 --> 13:28.147
you tell him
to come down here personally.

13:28.321 --> 13:30.915
l don't take my marching orders
from some errand boy.

13:31.090 --> 13:34.457
- Even if his name is Carson.
- Okay.

13:35.027 --> 13:37.757
Let's just cool down,
it's no big deal, all right?

13:37.930 --> 13:40.421
- l'm not the one making it a big deal.
- Okay.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.431
Look, why don't you just draw up
another budget

13:42.602 --> 13:44.866
and we'll deal with it tomorrow,
all right?

13:48.941 --> 13:50.932
Hey there, love of my life.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.670
Maury, come and meet my fiancee.

13:53.846 --> 13:55.780
Does she dress up this site
or what, huh?

13:57.617 --> 13:59.278
Yeah.

14:02.922 --> 14:04.890
David, what is your problem?

14:05.057 --> 14:06.752
l just don't wanna lie, okay?

14:06.926 --> 14:08.917
Who said anything about lying?

14:09.095 --> 14:10.562
l go out of town for 1 7 hours,

14:10.730 --> 14:13.028
and Jackie makes me out
to be some kind of a monster.

14:13.199 --> 14:15.861
Do you have any idea how much
child support l give that woman?

14:16.035 --> 14:18.503
Look, David,
the goal of this deposition tomorrow

14:18.671 --> 14:23.108
is to frame your father's trip to Cabo
in the best possible light.

14:23.276 --> 14:25.744
l know that. l just don't know
what you want me to say.

14:25.912 --> 14:28.039
You simply say
that your father hired a babysitter,

14:28.214 --> 14:30.512
when the babysitter didn't arrive,
he called you.

14:31.284 --> 14:33.616
- And?
- And that's it.

14:33.786 --> 14:36.687
You're Erin's older brother,
you're a very responsible young man,

14:36.856 --> 14:38.483
and your father knew
he could trust you.

14:38.658 --> 14:41.491
But the babysitter didn't show up
and Erin was running a fever.

14:41.661 --> 14:43.288
But that doesn't have anything to do

14:43.462 --> 14:45.191
with your father's intentions,
now, does it?

14:45.364 --> 14:48.629
Look, David, you'll do fine.

14:48.801 --> 14:50.701
Just wear a suit.

14:50.870 --> 14:55.136
Now, remember, Jackie's lawyer
is gonna use every trick in the book

14:55.308 --> 14:57.868
to try to get you to say something
damaging about your father.

14:58.044 --> 15:00.103
- Wonderful.
- Hey, don't sweat it.

15:00.279 --> 15:04.113
lf she backs you into a corner,
you just say, ''l can't remember.''

15:04.283 --> 15:06.183
How can l say that?
This was a couple days ago.

15:06.352 --> 15:08.411
Hey, leave the lawyering to me,
okay?

15:09.021 --> 15:11.649
A witness saying, ''l can't remember,''
is par for the course.

15:11.824 --> 15:14.588
David, the only reason Jackie
is going after Erin

15:14.760 --> 15:16.785
is because l have a girlfriend.

15:16.963 --> 15:18.954
That's what this is all about.

15:19.131 --> 15:21.895
And l need to know
that l can count on you tomorrow.

15:22.735 --> 15:23.759
Of course he can.

15:23.936 --> 15:27.667
David's gonna come through this
with flying colors. Aren't you, bud?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.240
Yeah, l'll do my best.

15:36.682 --> 15:37.910
This just isn't working out.

15:38.084 --> 15:39.984
lt's like a waste of his time
and mine.

15:40.152 --> 15:42.143
D'Shawn is determined
to just skate by.

15:42.321 --> 15:44.881
Look, l told you this was gonna be
a struggle. So get creative.

15:45.057 --> 15:47.457
- Try a different approach.
- Any suggestions?

15:47.627 --> 15:50.425
Yeah, but l can't get into it now,
l gotta catch a flight to San Diego.

15:50.596 --> 15:53.429
l'm doing a motivational seminar
for the entire Chargers' team.

15:53.599 --> 15:55.328
- Cool.
- Well, it's a living.

15:55.501 --> 15:57.230
Anyway, we'll get back into
the D'Shawn thing

15:57.403 --> 15:58.836
when l get back from San Diego.

15:59.472 --> 16:01.099
Okay.

16:01.841 --> 16:04.366
l've got a couple of hockey tickets
for the Mighty Ducks tonight.

16:04.543 --> 16:06.135
- You interested?
- Not tonight.

16:06.312 --> 16:08.405
l've got some other
indoor sports planned.

16:08.581 --> 16:10.242
l see. Hot date, huh?

16:10.416 --> 16:12.782
Well, in that case,
take a tip for my motivational seminar:

16:13.552 --> 16:15.452
''Score and score often.''

16:15.621 --> 16:17.486
- Come on, l'll walk you out.
- Okay.

16:57.196 --> 16:59.426
Bravo, bravo.

16:59.598 --> 17:01.122
God, l'm sorry.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.030
Let me just collect my stuff,
l'll get out of your way.

17:04.203 --> 17:07.194
No need to leave on account of me.
Actually, l came here to see you.

17:07.373 --> 17:10.069
- You did?
- You are Laura Kingman, right?

17:10.242 --> 17:11.334
l think so.

17:11.510 --> 17:13.410
Your roommate told me
l could find you here.

17:13.579 --> 17:18.811
- Where'd you learn to dance like that?
- l took dance all through high school.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.646
- Terrific.
- l'm still learning.

17:21.820 --> 17:24.118
- Can l ask you something?
- Sure.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.251
Who are you?

17:26.425 --> 17:27.790
Forgive me, l'm Steve Sanders.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.827
l'm Keith's friend from the KEG house.
lt's nice to meet you.

17:30.996 --> 17:33.157
God, l'm such a mess.

17:33.833 --> 17:35.164
Oh, no, you're not.

17:35.701 --> 17:37.430
l'm all sweaty and disheveled.

17:37.603 --> 17:40.367
Some of my best friends are sweaty
and disheveled.

17:41.273 --> 17:43.503
Listen, you don't have to go out
on a blind date with me

17:43.676 --> 17:44.700
if you don't want to.

17:44.877 --> 17:46.071
Well, we just met, right?

17:46.679 --> 17:48.476
lt's not a blind date anymore.

17:52.351 --> 17:53.511
Hey, Kel.

17:53.686 --> 17:55.620
Dylan, we should really stop meeting
like this.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.688
- How are you?
- l'm getting by. You seen Brenda?

17:57.857 --> 18:00.826
Yeah. l had breakfast with her
this morning. Why?

18:00.993 --> 18:03.723
l want to see where her head's at
with all this marriage stuff.

18:03.896 --> 18:04.954
A little jealous, are we?

18:05.131 --> 18:07.964
Wrong. l just think she's making
a mistake marrying this guy.

18:09.502 --> 18:11.129
Well, l think
you should let her be happy.

18:11.303 --> 18:12.930
Because it's really
none of your business.

18:13.105 --> 18:15.096
Kelly, the guy is bad news, okay?

18:15.274 --> 18:18.937
Well, you can't always choose who
you fall in love with, now, can you?

18:19.111 --> 18:20.669
Adios.

18:23.315 --> 18:24.543
Well, that was a treat.

18:24.717 --> 18:28.016
Definitely the most unique
chicken salad l've ever had.

18:28.187 --> 18:31.054
Well, maybe that's because
it was liverwurst.

18:31.223 --> 18:33.851
You fed me liverwurst?

18:34.026 --> 18:36.859
No, it was chicken salad, l swear.
lt was dark meat.

18:37.029 --> 18:39.122
Good. l thought we were about to have
our first fight.

18:39.298 --> 18:43.894
Well, while we're on the subject,
l'm sorry about that scene earlier.

18:44.904 --> 18:46.838
Maury's all right.
He's just a little hotheaded.

18:47.006 --> 18:48.405
You don't have to apologize to me.

18:48.574 --> 18:52.305
Well, l'd resent me too, you know,
coming in here, the boss' son.

18:52.478 --> 18:54.742
l mean, at the end of the day
l get to go back to Bel Air.

18:54.914 --> 18:57.781
What does Maury go home to?
A little house in the Valley?

18:57.950 --> 19:02.410
A wife, kids,
a mortgage he can barely afford.

19:02.588 --> 19:04.681
You just gotta have a little perspective,
you know?

19:08.060 --> 19:09.288
What was that for?

19:09.462 --> 19:11.020
Your perspective.

19:11.664 --> 19:12.756
Thanks.

19:13.799 --> 19:15.562
And your sensitivity.

19:16.302 --> 19:17.792
And your maturity.

19:18.304 --> 19:20.431
And the way you make me feel
when you kiss me.

19:23.476 --> 19:24.568
l'm crazy about you.

19:25.945 --> 19:28.175
And since you've finished
your chicken salad,

19:28.347 --> 19:29.678
you get dessert.

19:30.249 --> 19:31.807
Oh, and what's for dessert?

19:37.923 --> 19:38.981
Right here?

19:39.158 --> 19:42.093
Well, actually,
l had something else in mind.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.332
l wish l didn't have to
go back to school this afternoon.

19:59.845 --> 20:03.281
Brenda, if there's one thing l learned
at my one semester at Pepperdine,

20:03.449 --> 20:06.009
it's that they don't take attendance
in college.

20:06.185 --> 20:09.177
Well,
l wish l could stay here forever.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.913
Well, l don't know about forever,

20:11.090 --> 20:13.217
but for the next month,
it's yours, it's ours.

20:14.126 --> 20:15.388
What?

20:15.561 --> 20:17.256
l took the room for a month.

20:17.429 --> 20:19.294
lt could be our getaway.

20:19.465 --> 20:21.695
Or you can come here by yourself
if you need to,

20:21.867 --> 20:26.201
to think, sleep, study, whatever.

20:26.372 --> 20:29.899
You are incredible.
l've never met anyone like you.

20:30.075 --> 20:32.373
l've gotta get pen and paper.

20:32.545 --> 20:33.739
Why?

20:33.913 --> 20:36.438
Because l've gotta see
what my new name is gonna look like.

20:37.816 --> 20:39.716
Okay.

20:40.219 --> 20:43.450
- Well, there's paper, but no pen.
- Oh, there's one in my briefcase.

20:45.858 --> 20:48.952
l remember in junior high,
we used to practice writing our names

20:49.128 --> 20:52.154
just to see how it went
with every cute boy we knew.

20:52.331 --> 20:55.459
Somehow, Brenda Boycarsky
just didn't quite make it,

20:55.634 --> 20:57.693
you know what l mean?

20:57.870 --> 21:00.202
Well, Brenda Walsh-Carson
sounds good.

21:09.248 --> 21:10.306
What is this?

21:11.450 --> 21:13.418
Oh, God. Brenda.

21:15.955 --> 21:17.684
This is supposed to be for me, right?

21:18.123 --> 21:20.751
Yeah. lt's a prenuptial agreement.

21:20.926 --> 21:22.621
Yeah, l can read.

21:22.795 --> 21:24.285
lt was my father's idea.

21:24.463 --> 21:26.021
l wasn't even going to show it to you.

21:26.198 --> 21:28.325
That's why you're carrying it around
in your briefcase?

21:28.500 --> 21:31.560
Brenda, you know my father.
He's all business.

21:32.071 --> 21:35.165
He just thinks it's important to
get certain matters out into the open.

21:35.341 --> 21:37.309
And what about you?

21:37.476 --> 21:38.534
What do you think?

21:40.946 --> 21:41.970
l don't know.

21:42.147 --> 21:43.910
Am l supposed to get
an attorney or something?

21:44.083 --> 21:46.449
No, no, no. lt's not that big a deal.

21:46.619 --> 21:48.348
Well,
maybe it's not a big deal to you.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.546
l mean, in your world l'm sure
this kind of thing happens all the time.

21:52.391 --> 21:55.883
l just didn't realize that marriage
was a business deal.

21:56.061 --> 21:57.289
Brenda.

21:57.463 --> 21:59.863
Brenda, don't go like this, please.

22:00.299 --> 22:02.631
l didn't hear you say
that l don't have to sign it.

22:05.537 --> 22:07.334
l thought so.

22:23.122 --> 22:26.649
- Hey, you going out tonight?
- Yup, l have a date.

22:27.793 --> 22:30.489
Aren't you even gonna ask me
who it's with?

22:30.663 --> 22:33.962
- Sorry. Who is she?
- Not telling.

22:35.467 --> 22:38.459
Brandon, l'm in no mood for jokes.

22:38.637 --> 22:40.434
Why, what's the matter?

22:41.040 --> 22:42.905
Promise not to tell anyone?

22:43.075 --> 22:46.067
Not even Mom and Dad?
Especially not Mom and Dad.

22:46.245 --> 22:47.712
Sure, what is it?

22:48.547 --> 22:51.072
The Carsons want me to sign
a prenuptial agreement.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.013
You're kidding. What does it say?

22:53.185 --> 22:55.210
lt says that if Stuart and l
ever get divorced,

22:55.387 --> 22:58.447
l'm not entitled
to any of the Carsons' money.

22:58.624 --> 23:00.285
As if l would ever want it.

23:02.795 --> 23:04.592
And l actually thought
that he loved me.

23:04.763 --> 23:08.426
Now, Bren, it doesn't necessarily mean
that he doesn't love you.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.592
No, it just means
that he doesn't trust me.

23:12.204 --> 23:15.640
l think this is gonna be
the shortest engagement in history.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.538
Well, maybe that wouldn't be
such a bad thing.

23:19.511 --> 23:20.978
You don't like Stuart either, do you?

23:21.146 --> 23:23.910
lt's not that l don't like him, Bren.
l just-- l don't know the guy.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.176
l really don't know him.

23:26.351 --> 23:28.911
Yeah, well,
maybe l don't know him either.

23:31.824 --> 23:33.883
l could cancel my date
if you wanna hang out tonight.

23:34.059 --> 23:35.617
No, it's okay.

23:35.794 --> 23:38.490
There's a poetry reading
at school tonight. l wasn't gonna go,

23:38.664 --> 23:41.462
but maybe it'll take my mind
off of all this.

23:48.407 --> 23:50.136
Talk about lndian summer.

23:50.309 --> 23:51.833
How glad am l
that we live by the beach?

23:52.010 --> 23:54.410
lt's like ten degrees cooler here.

23:54.813 --> 23:56.542
What's happening?

23:57.316 --> 23:59.546
Why don't you ask your mother?

24:00.919 --> 24:03.479
- l guess you heard about the lawsuit?
- Heard about it?

24:03.655 --> 24:05.680
l gotta give a deposition tomorrow
for her lawyers.

24:05.858 --> 24:07.223
How long have you known
about this?

24:07.993 --> 24:09.858
Jackie just told me about it
this morning.

24:10.896 --> 24:13.456
Look, David, l tried to talk her out of it.
l'm really sorry.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.691
Yeah, not as sorry as l am.
Not as sorry as my father is.

24:16.869 --> 24:18.769
Well, he's the one
who started this whole thing.

24:18.937 --> 24:21.371
Started what? Jackie's the one
challenging his custody rights.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.600
Let us not forget that he's the one who
was fooling around with his hygienist.

24:24.777 --> 24:27.541
- What does that have to do with this?
- Everything.

24:27.713 --> 24:28.907
Would you guys stop this?

24:29.081 --> 24:31.413
Didn't you make a pact not to let Mel
and Jackie's problems

24:31.583 --> 24:32.607
become your own?

24:34.453 --> 24:36.045
Fine.

24:41.827 --> 24:43.419
You don't have to hang out
in the kitchen.

24:43.595 --> 24:45.790
Oh, yes, l do.
The salad needs chopping

24:45.964 --> 24:49.627
and you're looking at a man with years
of kitchen cleaver experience.

24:49.802 --> 24:51.497
So l see.

24:51.670 --> 24:54.935
- Well, welcome to my kitchen.
- Thank you. lt's a lovely kitchen.

24:55.107 --> 24:58.008
Yeah, l must say, being out in the wild
of Central America

24:58.177 --> 25:00.805
made me miss its little luxuries.

25:00.979 --> 25:04.244
- Cuisinart, pasta maker--
- Running water.

25:04.416 --> 25:05.781
Yeah, exactly.

25:06.819 --> 25:09.014
Now, tell me something,

25:09.888 --> 25:11.685
these too spicy?

25:13.725 --> 25:16.592
No, just right. What do you think?

25:28.440 --> 25:29.498
l like it hot.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.634
Me too.

25:31.810 --> 25:35.211
Not now. lf we keep this up,
we won't get to the main course.

25:35.380 --> 25:38.713
Well, one thing
you need to know about me,

25:38.884 --> 25:43.014
no matter how many hors d'oeuvres
l sample, l never seem to get full.

25:43.188 --> 25:47.215
Well, good. Because l have prepared
an authentic Guatemalan feast.

25:47.392 --> 25:48.984
How exotic.

25:49.161 --> 25:51.129
And that's just my cooking.

25:58.837 --> 26:01.670
- Hey, cool masks.
- Thanks.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.934
My husband and l spent years
collecting them.

26:05.544 --> 26:06.670
Your husband?

26:08.947 --> 26:11.438
So how long
have you been divorced?

26:11.617 --> 26:14.245
l'm not divorced, Brandon.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.744
Really?

26:16.588 --> 26:18.647
Don't worry. He's far away.

26:21.159 --> 26:22.649
l mean, is this a problem for you?

26:23.161 --> 26:25.186
Because it's certainly not for me.

26:26.398 --> 26:29.196
So you guys have some sort
of understanding?

26:30.569 --> 26:34.027
Well, he doesn't ask, l don't tell.
lt's sort of like the military, you know?

26:36.241 --> 26:39.472
But, look, l don't wanna talk about him
right now.

26:39.645 --> 26:43.172
l mean,
unless you feel you really need to.

26:48.186 --> 26:50.177
Nope, can't say that l do.

26:50.822 --> 26:52.653
Come on, let's eat.

27:03.235 --> 27:05.795
With you,
The earth was a bed of grass

27:05.971 --> 27:08.735
We sIept in it Iike two seeds

27:08.907 --> 27:11.375
With you, I was more than I am

27:11.543 --> 27:14.137
Your mouth, the sun

27:14.313 --> 27:16.838
Made everything possibIe

27:17.015 --> 27:20.382
I burn with the Iove that I Iost
When I Iost you

27:22.387 --> 27:23.411
Thank you, Dylan.

27:23.922 --> 27:26.254
And thanks to all of you
for coming tonight

27:26.425 --> 27:29.292
on our first Thursday-night reading.

27:29.461 --> 27:30.894
Thanks again.

27:38.704 --> 27:40.069
That was beautiful.

27:40.238 --> 27:42.297
Thanks. l found it last night.

27:42.474 --> 27:44.203
Kind of reminds me of you.

27:49.781 --> 27:53.012
- You wanna get some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

27:55.787 --> 27:57.049
l didn't say it was a bad movie.

27:57.222 --> 27:59.315
l just like LethaI Weapon 2
a hell of a lot better.

27:59.491 --> 28:03.052
Oh, l'll take Mel Gibson
anywhere, anytime, anyplace.

28:03.228 --> 28:04.718
Sanders, where'd you find this girl?

28:04.896 --> 28:08.354
Well, l dialed one of those
1 -900 numbers.

28:09.868 --> 28:11.597
Excuse us,
where is the little-girls' room?

28:11.770 --> 28:15.001
Oh, out the door and bang a left.

28:15.674 --> 28:18.199
Oh, but enter at your own risk.

28:19.111 --> 28:20.510
Laura's terrific, man.

28:20.679 --> 28:23.011
Yeah, she's a lot of fun.

28:23.181 --> 28:24.842
Well, listen,
just for your information,

28:25.017 --> 28:27.178
John's otherwise engaged
for the evening.

28:27.352 --> 28:30.788
- Oh, with who? Erica or Kelly?
- Beth.

28:30.956 --> 28:31.980
- Beth?
- Yeah.

28:32.157 --> 28:33.920
Beth, who--?

28:34.092 --> 28:35.719
Brother Sears is quite the player,
huh?

28:35.894 --> 28:38.089
Yeah, an inspiration to us all.

28:38.263 --> 28:40.697
So anyway,
if you need a bedroom it's available.

28:40.866 --> 28:42.265
Thanks, but l have a girlfriend.

28:43.035 --> 28:46.801
Hey, man, l'm just making you aware
of all your options, all right?

28:57.215 --> 28:59.308
Who is in charge
of cleaning your bathrooms?

29:00.619 --> 29:02.484
Me. Why, is it disgusting?

29:03.388 --> 29:04.946
lt was an adventure.

29:05.123 --> 29:07.887
l'm sorry about that. Do you want one
of these before l take you home?

29:08.060 --> 29:09.721
Why, do you have
an early class tomorrow?

29:10.529 --> 29:11.553
No.

29:16.334 --> 29:18.734
l'm kind of surprised
to see you out alone tonight.

29:18.904 --> 29:19.928
Why?

29:20.105 --> 29:23.973
You and your fiance,
you've been inseparable lately.

29:24.142 --> 29:26.576
Well, l can get along without him.

29:26.745 --> 29:29.111
You really love this guy, Bren?

29:30.182 --> 29:32.446
Tonight's not the night to ask.

29:32.984 --> 29:35.509
Well, if you're not sure,
then you better not marry him.

29:35.687 --> 29:39.555
- Dylan, you know me better than that.
- l know you better than anybody.

29:40.625 --> 29:41.649
l know you do.

29:41.827 --> 29:44.227
And l gotta tell you,
secretly in the back of my mind,

29:44.396 --> 29:46.125
l've been hoping the whole thing
falls apart.

29:47.032 --> 29:48.897
Dylan, come on, that's not fair.

29:49.067 --> 29:51.695
l don't wanna hear that,
especially tonight.

29:51.870 --> 29:53.565
lf you marry this guy, Bren,

29:54.172 --> 29:56.106
you and l
will never have another chance.

29:56.575 --> 29:58.304
What are you talking about?

30:00.879 --> 30:03.211
You're just trying
to get me to break up with Stuart.

30:03.381 --> 30:04.405
Hey, at this point,

30:04.583 --> 30:07.450
l would say or do anything to get you
to call off this stupid engagement.

30:07.619 --> 30:08.950
Why?

30:09.121 --> 30:10.986
You've only known the guy for what,
three weeks?

30:11.156 --> 30:14.057
Oh, that's an original line.
Like l haven't heard that one before.

30:14.226 --> 30:16.285
Your parents are very worried
about you.

30:17.429 --> 30:19.158
Have you been talking
to my parents?

30:21.299 --> 30:23.062
My father put you up to this,
didn't he?

30:23.235 --> 30:25.795
Hey, l talked to your father,
but he didn't put me up to anything.

30:25.971 --> 30:26.995
l care about you.

30:27.172 --> 30:30.335
l am so sick and tired of everybody
telling me how to live my life.

30:30.876 --> 30:34.312
lt's my life, Dylan.
l will live it how l want to.

30:40.519 --> 30:41.543
Well, after all that food,

30:41.720 --> 30:44.348
l'm certainly glad l decided
to get back into shape.

30:44.523 --> 30:46.388
l think you're in great shape.

30:46.558 --> 30:49.118
For someone my age?

30:59.271 --> 31:01.569
You think we'd be
more comfortable upstairs?

31:01.740 --> 31:04.231
l always thought beds
were overrated.

31:04.409 --> 31:06.001
Yeah, you're right.

31:06.178 --> 31:08.442
Let's get naked right here.

31:10.916 --> 31:13.146
- Oh, God, look what l did.
- Don't worry about it.

31:13.318 --> 31:14.910
- You can't take me anywhere.
- lt's okay.

31:15.086 --> 31:17.577
No, no, that's all right, l got it.
l got it, hang on.

31:20.892 --> 31:22.587
Wait a minute.

31:24.696 --> 31:27.358
ls your husband Professor Randall?

31:27.532 --> 31:28.931
You know him?

31:29.100 --> 31:32.866
Know him?
l'm in his freshman sociology class.

31:33.038 --> 31:35.939
So what? l mean, it's a huge class.
l'm sure he barely even notices you.

31:36.107 --> 31:39.599
No, you don't understand.
l talk to him every day.

31:41.079 --> 31:44.344
- l tutor this basketball player--
- You're D'Shawn Hardell's tutor?

31:44.516 --> 31:46.484
The one and only.

31:48.453 --> 31:51.388
Well, then l guess we'll just have to be
a little more careful.

31:52.023 --> 31:54.218
Look, l gotta go.

31:55.327 --> 31:56.589
Why?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.291
When l look at this picture,
do you know what l hear him saying?

32:04.469 --> 32:07.495
''l have my life and she has hers.

32:08.073 --> 32:10.166
l just want my wife to be happy.''

32:10.342 --> 32:12.003
And you know
what l hear him saying?

32:12.177 --> 32:16.204
l hear him saying, ''You touch my wife,
l'm gonna flunk you, pal.''

32:18.416 --> 32:19.906
This is just wrong.

32:20.085 --> 32:22.144
You're not leaving?

32:22.320 --> 32:26.518
Listen, dinner was great.
l had a wonderful time.

32:26.691 --> 32:28.659
Thank you very much, l gotta go.

32:28.827 --> 32:30.795
Come on.
You're acting like a silly little kid.

32:30.962 --> 32:34.489
No, no, no.
A silly little kid would stay.

32:36.701 --> 32:38.259
Good night.

32:49.114 --> 32:52.675
Oh, Brenda, would you come in here,
honey? We'd like to talk to you.

32:52.851 --> 32:55.319
Yeah, that's fine
because l really wanna talk to you too.

32:55.487 --> 32:58.285
l'm glad you're both here because
l don't wanna have to say this twice.

32:58.456 --> 32:59.582
Don't take that tone with us.

32:59.758 --> 33:02.226
Right now, l will take any tone
l damn well please.

33:02.394 --> 33:03.725
Brenda.

33:05.096 --> 33:07.064
How could you humiliate me like that,
Dad?

33:08.066 --> 33:09.260
What are you talking about?

33:09.434 --> 33:11.766
You know exactly
what l am talking about.

33:12.337 --> 33:13.929
What exactly did you say to Dylan

33:14.105 --> 33:16.005
to get him to throw himself at me
like that?

33:17.108 --> 33:19.508
l mean, did you really think
l would fall for it?

33:19.978 --> 33:21.741
My God, what is wrong with you?

33:22.914 --> 33:26.077
You call this love?
You claim to love me?

33:26.251 --> 33:28.014
And then you pull some stunt
like this?

33:30.221 --> 33:31.654
What if l had listened to Dylan?

33:32.157 --> 33:34.318
And then eventually found out
about your little deceit.

33:34.492 --> 33:36.323
Where would that have left me?

33:38.163 --> 33:40.290
My God, l can't even trust
my own parents anymore.

33:41.833 --> 33:45.394
You know, at least when the Carsons
play games, they're up front about it.

33:45.904 --> 33:46.996
What do you mean by that?

33:47.639 --> 33:49.266
Nothing.

33:50.408 --> 33:53.241
- Brenda, come back. We need to talk.
- No, l am finished talking.

33:53.411 --> 33:55.379
Now, l am going upstairs
and l'm going to pack.

33:55.547 --> 33:56.809
And then l'm leaving this house.

33:56.981 --> 34:00.007
And l don't want either one of you
to try and stop me.

34:17.068 --> 34:20.525
Yeah, thanks, Larry.
Yeah, l'll call if we hear anything.

34:20.705 --> 34:23.036
Yeah, l know you're concerned.
So are we.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.869
Thanks.

34:25.744 --> 34:26.904
So, what did he say?

34:27.078 --> 34:29.273
Apparently, Stuart and Brenda
had a fight yesterday,

34:29.447 --> 34:32.074
and Stuart hasn't heard
from Brenda since.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.242
Jim, l'm sorry.
l kind of feel like this is my fault.

34:35.420 --> 34:39.014
Don't be ridiculous.
lf it's anyone's fault, it's mine.

34:39.190 --> 34:40.554
l don't know what l was thinking.

34:40.725 --> 34:43.489
Listen, guys,
l know Brenda like l know myself.

34:43.661 --> 34:45.150
And l know
she wouldn't run out of here

34:45.330 --> 34:47.092
without knowing
exactly where she was going.

34:48.132 --> 34:49.225
l'm sure she's fine.

35:13.558 --> 35:16.220
Hi, is this the concierge?

35:16.394 --> 35:19.522
Yes, this is Room 31 6.

35:20.031 --> 35:22.795
ls there a notary public in the hotel?

35:25.170 --> 35:29.163
Sanders, you stud, you gotta tell me
what went on last night.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.331
l hear you put my room to good use.

35:31.509 --> 35:33.568
Yeah, well, l guess.

35:33.745 --> 35:34.803
What do you mean,
you guess?

35:34.979 --> 35:36.947
Don't tell me
the evening was a total loss.

35:37.115 --> 35:38.605
No, it...

35:39.217 --> 35:40.707
No, it wasn't a total loss.

35:40.885 --> 35:42.978
So share and share alike,
my brother.

35:43.154 --> 35:45.486
Was Laura worth writing home about,
or what?

35:46.024 --> 35:47.252
What do you care?

35:47.425 --> 35:50.019
l mean, how many girls can you juggle
at one time, Sears?

35:50.195 --> 35:51.719
As many as l can.

35:51.896 --> 35:53.955
What about Kelly?

35:54.132 --> 35:55.929
What about her?

35:56.100 --> 35:57.965
You told me
you were crazy about her.

35:58.136 --> 35:59.865
And you told me
you were crazy about Celeste.

36:00.038 --> 36:02.666
That's different.
l'm doing Keith a favor.

36:03.508 --> 36:05.999
Hey, l understand, Steve.

36:06.478 --> 36:08.446
l hope Celeste sees it that way.

36:13.251 --> 36:17.153
David, l'd like to discuss the events
of Saturday, October the 30th,

36:17.322 --> 36:19.222
when your father left Erin
in your custody

36:19.390 --> 36:23.759
to go down to Cabo, San Lucas,
with his lady friend.

36:24.963 --> 36:27.193
Did he leave you a number
where he could be reached?

36:27.365 --> 36:28.832
Yes, he did, on the refrigerator.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.831
Well, then why didn't you call him

36:31.002 --> 36:33.266
when you first realized
that Erin was running a fever?

36:33.771 --> 36:37.104
Well, because l didn't realize
Erin was sick until--

36:38.910 --> 36:40.309
Go on.

36:40.478 --> 36:43.413
Well, until Jackie took her home
from the Walshes' party.

36:43.948 --> 36:45.108
Really?

36:45.283 --> 36:46.614
She was dehydrated

36:46.784 --> 36:49.514
and listless
with a temperature of 1 03.

36:49.687 --> 36:52.019
But you, who had been with her
for the previous four hours,

36:52.190 --> 36:54.750
had no indication
that there was any trouble?

36:55.460 --> 36:57.894
She seemed fine, really, she did.

36:58.363 --> 37:01.457
But, of course,
you have no formal training

37:01.633 --> 37:03.692
or experience with child care?

37:05.136 --> 37:06.660
Well, l lived with Erin for over a year

37:06.838 --> 37:08.931
and was involved
in almost every aspect of her life.

37:09.107 --> 37:12.338
l changed her diaper, l fed her.

37:13.511 --> 37:16.480
Honestly, l feel l'm capable
of taking care of Erin

37:16.648 --> 37:18.309
under any circumstances.

37:19.517 --> 37:21.075
Okay.

37:23.555 --> 37:27.355
Why did Mel and Jackie decide
to get a divorce?

37:30.495 --> 37:32.258
l guess they just weren't happy.

37:32.430 --> 37:36.594
Wasn't it because your father was
having an affair with his hygienist?

37:36.768 --> 37:38.429
Yeah, l guess so.

37:38.603 --> 37:42.471
And why did your mother
and father decide to get a divorce?

37:42.640 --> 37:44.130
What does this have to do with Erin?

37:44.309 --> 37:46.539
l'm just trying to show
a pattern of behavior,

37:46.711 --> 37:49.680
which any court
would find admissible.

37:49.847 --> 37:50.939
lt's okay, Mel.

37:51.115 --> 37:55.518
This isn't the first time your father's
had affairs with his hygienists, is it?

37:56.988 --> 37:58.012
No.

37:58.189 --> 38:01.955
ln fact,
your father's repeated infidelity

38:02.126 --> 38:05.562
is what caused your mother
to file for divorce.

38:06.764 --> 38:08.231
l don't remember.

38:10.535 --> 38:13.265
You don't remember when your
mother had a nervous breakdown?

38:13.438 --> 38:16.601
Look, lady, you wanna start
dredging up this crap about my past?

38:16.774 --> 38:19.436
Then let's start talking
about Jackie's cocaine addiction

38:19.611 --> 38:21.511
and all the men
that she slept around with.

38:21.679 --> 38:22.703
- Gary.
- Mel.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.007
She is not exactly
a model of motherhood.

38:25.183 --> 38:26.445
Now, l am a damn good father

38:26.618 --> 38:29.348
and you are not taking my little baby
away from me.

38:29.854 --> 38:32.982
Tell her, David.
Tell her all the time l was there for you.

38:33.157 --> 38:35.284
For your nursery school,
and your Little League,

38:35.460 --> 38:37.394
and your bar mitzvah.

38:39.897 --> 38:41.091
Tell her!

38:42.166 --> 38:43.190
Yeah.

38:45.136 --> 38:48.537
Because of my father's infidelity,
my mother had a nervous breakdown.

39:00.118 --> 39:01.278
Great, thank you.

39:04.355 --> 39:06.414
Brandon.

39:06.591 --> 39:07.785
Professor Randall.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.857
Hey, l'm glad l caught up with you.

39:11.029 --> 39:12.621
You didn't hang around
after class today.

39:12.797 --> 39:14.594
No, l had some business
to take care of.

39:14.766 --> 39:15.790
How was San Diego?

39:15.967 --> 39:18.663
lt was terrific. Listen,
l understand you met my better half.

39:19.737 --> 39:22.331
- Lucinda.
- Lucinda?

39:22.507 --> 39:24.998
Yeah, she said she worked out
with you at the gym the other day.

39:25.176 --> 39:26.973
Oh, right, right, Lucinda, yeah.

39:27.145 --> 39:28.669
Anyway,
she was very taken with you.

39:28.846 --> 39:31.542
And we both decided we'd like
to have you over for dinner sometime.

39:31.716 --> 39:33.308
- Dinner?
- Yeah, so maybe next week.

39:33.484 --> 39:35.975
Why don't you see what's good for you
and get back to us?

39:36.154 --> 39:38.452
Sure, great.

39:38.623 --> 39:41.558
- Yeah, well, l gotta run.
- See you.

39:42.827 --> 39:44.852
Yeah.

39:54.138 --> 39:57.699
Well, l'm glad you like it, Stuart.
l'll get my guys right on it.

39:58.676 --> 40:00.371
Hi.

40:01.512 --> 40:03.139
Brenda.

40:03.815 --> 40:06.147
Everyone's been worried sick
about you. Where have you been?

40:06.317 --> 40:08.251
At the hotel.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.410
l called there.

40:10.588 --> 40:12.249
Yeah, l know.
l wasn't answering the phone.

40:12.423 --> 40:14.152
l really didn't feel
like talking to anybody.

40:14.325 --> 40:17.624
l needed some time by myself
to think things out.

40:18.863 --> 40:21.058
Well, you're entitled.

40:21.232 --> 40:23.723
Glad you had some time to be alone.

40:25.303 --> 40:28.329
l want you to know that l didn't fall in
love with you because of your money.

40:28.506 --> 40:30.167
l know that,
that's not what this is about.

40:30.341 --> 40:32.104
l never would've thought of
suggesting it if--

40:32.276 --> 40:35.177
- Will you just please let me finish?
- l'm sorry. Go ahead.

40:36.347 --> 40:39.180
l would never want to depend on you,
because you have more than me.

40:39.350 --> 40:41.614
Or more than my family.

40:41.953 --> 40:43.784
That's not what marriage is about.

40:44.388 --> 40:46.219
And if one day, we split up,

40:46.390 --> 40:49.325
l certainly wouldn't want anything
that didn't belong to me.

40:50.828 --> 40:52.659
Stuart, your parents are not wrong.

40:53.131 --> 40:55.395
They don't know me any better
than my parents know you.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.690
So the bottom line is,

40:58.369 --> 41:01.361
a prenup is probably
a very good idea.

41:01.873 --> 41:04.068
l just hated being blind-sided,
that's all.

41:04.242 --> 41:06.210
You're right. l was scared.

41:06.377 --> 41:08.038
l didn't know how you would take it.

41:08.212 --> 41:09.770
And l didn't want to lose you over it.

41:10.448 --> 41:11.915
l know.

41:14.418 --> 41:16.943
Signed, sealed and delivered.

41:17.588 --> 41:18.885
You'd do this for me?

41:19.056 --> 41:20.523
l love you.

41:20.691 --> 41:23.592
l'm not gonna let your father
or my father stand in our way.

41:27.331 --> 41:29.128
l love you so much, Brenda.

41:31.068 --> 41:34.902
ln six months, l'm tearing this up.
l don't care what my father says.

41:35.439 --> 41:37.771
l'm never letting you go.

41:43.548 --> 41:46.312
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

41:46.484 --> 41:49.510
Look, we're reheating up a casserole
my mom sent over if you're hungry.

41:49.687 --> 41:53.589
l'd really rather starve to death
than eat something your mother made.

41:54.692 --> 41:56.250
Look, l don't know
what happened today--

41:56.427 --> 41:58.657
No, you don't know.

41:58.963 --> 42:00.794
You weren't there when my father
started crying

42:00.965 --> 42:02.865
because your mother's lawyer
went on the warpath.

42:04.335 --> 42:05.563
Listen, l'm sorry.

42:05.736 --> 42:07.727
You're sorry.
That's exactly what l said

42:07.905 --> 42:10.135
when my dad looked at me
with tears in his eyes and said,

42:10.308 --> 42:11.741
''How could you sell me out?

42:14.378 --> 42:16.505
You know, my mom said
something like this could happen.

42:16.681 --> 42:18.012
You know what, Kelly?

42:18.182 --> 42:21.083
l really don't care what your mother
says anymore, all right?

42:21.252 --> 42:22.617
And l think you should just shut up

42:22.787 --> 42:25.085
before l say something
l might just regret.

42:26.257 --> 42:28.589
Fine. Have a nice life.

42:28.759 --> 42:30.659
Kelly, don't be mad.
He didn't mean what he said.

42:30.828 --> 42:33.763
- Let's go back, we'll talk this thing out.
- Sorry, Donna, it is too late.

42:33.931 --> 42:37.423
lf anybody calls for me,
just tell them l'm staying at my mom's.

42:38.302 --> 42:40.236
David, l know you're upset,

42:40.404 --> 42:42.463
but what happened today
has nothing to do with Kelly.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.868
Donna, l don't care.

42:44.041 --> 42:46.407
Well, l do because now
she's moving out of the house.

42:46.577 --> 42:50.240
lf you're gonna start taking her side,
why don't you leave too?
