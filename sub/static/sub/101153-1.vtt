Translation: aytug2001

01:59.186 --> 02:02.825
Have you been convicted of a serious crime before?

02:17.495 --> 02:19.495
I shot him.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.794
Really?

02:23.056 --> 02:25.369
He was a tough motherfucker.

02:25.805 --> 02:27.805
I shot him 9 times.

02:28.704 --> 02:30.480
I finally killed it.

02:32.321 --> 02:34.321
- Are you done? - Yes sir.

02:34.810 --> 02:36.709
You can call me Ed.

02:37.285 --> 02:38.809
Come with me.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.747
Have you ever worked at a gas station?

02:45.215 --> 02:46.407
No.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.798
Do you have your own car?

02:50.144 --> 02:51.910
Not yet.

02:52.066 --> 02:56.264
But my friend can bring me or I can come by bus. - OK.

03:03.344 --> 03:06.329
We're looking for someone to work on the night shift.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.322
From 10am to 6am.

03:09.868 --> 03:13.180
Let me tell you, there won't be much work here.

03:13.592 --> 03:15.392
But you have guests.

03:15.455 --> 03:18.650
Hunters and farmers come around four o'clock.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.433
Are these watches suitable for you?

03:21.786 --> 03:24.425
Yes, I can work whenever you want.

03:27.821 --> 03:30.203
I wish you had more experience.

03:30.334 --> 03:34.073
I learn fast and I am very hardworking.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.274
You mean you were convicted of a serious crime?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.084
Yes.

03:45.027 --> 03:46.690
Did you go to jail?

03:49.429 --> 03:51.141
A short time.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.517
Why?

04:01.689 --> 04:03.816
I burned my boyfriend.

04:11.922 --> 04:13.620
Was it right?

04:17.053 --> 04:18.386
Yes.

04:19.345 --> 04:22.331
- When did you get out? - Two weeks ago.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.918
My parole officer told me here.

04:26.039 --> 04:29.143
- You mean you have a parole officer? - Tom Doogan.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.414
It was he who told me this job.

04:32.729 --> 04:34.376
I know Tom.

04:40.605 --> 04:43.043
I need this job a lot.

04:44.742 --> 04:48.423
I had a job interview this morning, actually the man did not like it very much.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.393
It reminded me of my daughter's husband. He is the only one in the ass.

04:54.522 --> 04:56.923
I usually act with my hunch.

04:58.903 --> 05:01.243
Do you promise not to do anything for me?

05:01.318 --> 05:03.352
Yes, promise.

05:04.264 --> 05:06.981
Well, the job is yours.

05:09.678 --> 05:11.250
Thank you.

05:12.553 --> 05:16.491
I've been looking for work since I got out of jail.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.843
It was very good.

05:19.981 --> 05:21.619
You will not regret.

05:21.708 --> 05:25.118
- Can you start tonight? - Sure, absolutely.

05:26.099 --> 05:28.485
Is there a number I can reach you?

05:28.780 --> 05:32.236
No, I don't have a mobile phone right now.

05:32.342 --> 05:33.715
Home phone?

05:35.064 --> 05:37.429
Come here around 9:30.

05:37.536 --> 05:41.462
I'll show you around and show you how to use the cash register.

05:42.685 --> 05:44.291
Okay.

05:45.669 --> 05:48.261
Nice to meet you, Mary. Good luck.

05:48.562 --> 05:50.159
Thank you.

05:50.712 --> 05:53.627
Tell Tom he owes me a pack of 6 beers.

06:05.789 --> 06:07.137
Eee?

06:08.327 --> 06:09.788
I got a job.

06:09.866 --> 06:13.600
Oh my god, Mary! Congratulations.

06:14.169 --> 06:18.387
Her salary is not very good and I have to work in the night shift, but ...

06:18.760 --> 06:20.760
... whatever is my acceptance, right?

06:20.835 --> 06:24.099
You definitely have to get into work. This is a great first step.

06:24.548 --> 06:26.426
So when do you start?

06:27.095 --> 06:30.542
- This night. - Wow, it was fast.

06:31.228 --> 06:32.713
Yes.

06:32.776 --> 06:35.965
I will take you to this lunch to celebrate. What are your plans?

06:36.826 --> 06:39.397
I need to speak to my parole at 11 o'clock.

06:39.604 --> 06:43.109
- Shall we meet at Canton Square at 12:30? - OK.

06:43.284 --> 06:45.475
I think this is the beginning of a new life.

07:45.043 --> 07:47.894
- 12:30. - See you then.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.693
Help me! Help me!

08:33.128 --> 08:35.128
Help me!

08:35.370 --> 08:37.587
I did it all for you, Mary.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.924
Watch me, Mary.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.039
I know you love watching.

09:17.984 --> 09:19.507
You are not real.

09:19.569 --> 09:21.116
You are not real.

09:25.407 --> 09:27.126
You are not real.

09:51.877 --> 09:54.900
Yeah yeah. I'm fine.

09:57.502 --> 10:01.818
Why didn't you knock on the door? You can't just go into people's house.

10:02.708 --> 10:04.032
The door was open.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.382
- Is it already 11? - Yes.

10:09.082 --> 10:10.571
Who's in the bathroom?

10:12.449 --> 10:13.773
Nobody.

10:29.345 --> 10:31.345
Who were you talking to?

10:32.328 --> 10:34.253
I wasn't talking to anyone.

10:53.123 --> 10:56.019
I tried to call you. What's wrong with your phone?

10:58.466 --> 11:00.734
- Not plugged in. - Why?

11:01.679 --> 11:05.003
- Because I don't want a phone. - Put the phone on the wall.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.382
This is not a request.

11:07.794 --> 11:10.604
Things can get harder if I can't reach you.

11:11.898 --> 11:15.183
Listen, I have information about your boyfriend and you.

11:15.630 --> 11:18.627
I'm sure you'll carry some things in your life.

11:20.285 --> 11:23.157
Now you have a chance to do something.

11:24.013 --> 11:26.013
So don't mess it up.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.332
I am not crazy.

11:28.357 --> 11:30.979
Dosyan says paranoid and delusional.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.778
Seeing hallucinations.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.663
- I did not do anything. - So why are you here?

11:39.264 --> 11:42.933
You should hide those deniers who care about them.

11:46.328 --> 11:49.287
- I got a job. - Well done.

11:51.326 --> 11:54.362
- Where? - Deer gas station.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.944
Did you see? You listened to my advice.

11:59.229 --> 12:01.350
- Ed says he owes him a 6-pack beer. - Yes.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.726
I owe more of that old bastard than 6 beer.

12:04.343 --> 12:06.026
When do you start?

12:06.680 --> 12:07.855
This night.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.742
Well.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.545
Thank you.

12:12.829 --> 12:14.913
I'll come to control you tonight.

12:25.024 --> 12:27.273
Let me give you a secret.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.721
Most people did not want you to be released.

12:29.781 --> 12:32.300
They still think his condition is pretty unstable.

12:32.465 --> 12:35.435
Many families and officials want you to fail.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.347
It would be a pleasure for you to do something stupid.

12:38.372 --> 12:42.743
So they will use that thing against you, they will click you in and throw you the key.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.713
Just like your boyfriend.

12:45.738 --> 12:48.465
Guess who's your only source of information?

12:49.572 --> 12:51.345
- Joyful. - Right.

12:51.423 --> 12:54.657
So watch your behavior, report to me every day.

12:55.013 --> 12:57.692
I make sure he's not back to jail.

12:58.084 --> 12:59.611
Is that clear?

13:01.246 --> 13:04.014
- I thought you didn't care. - Not anyway.

14:23.502 --> 14:24.865
Are you okay?

14:26.665 --> 14:27.974
Yes.

14:27.999 --> 14:32.349
- What were you looking at? - Nothing. I thought I saw someone.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.112
- Who? - Nobody.

14:35.159 --> 14:38.625
- Are you ready? - Yes. Shall we go to Harmons or Mayflower?

14:39.104 --> 14:40.706
Mayflower olsun.

14:53.005 --> 14:55.831
Come on. Tell me more about this job.

14:56.706 --> 14:58.280
What do you want to know?

14:59.021 --> 15:00.665
What did the shop owner say?

15:02.057 --> 15:04.376
“I wish you had more experience,” he said.

15:04.412 --> 15:07.576
It's the gas station. You don't do brain surgery.

15:07.731 --> 15:10.901
Yes, but I have never worked at a gas station before.

15:11.190 --> 15:14.029
My cousin is working and is an idiot.

15:14.078 --> 15:16.430
So you can handle it.

15:17.636 --> 15:20.035
I can't eat, I'm so nervous.

15:20.111 --> 15:22.085
Why are you nervous?

15:23.384 --> 15:24.857
I do not know.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.668
If you don't eat, can I have it?

15:29.165 --> 15:30.856
Of course.

15:35.521 --> 15:39.932
You asked what I was looking for outside.

15:41.242 --> 15:44.613
- Yes. Someone was looking at me.

15:45.051 --> 15:46.461
Kim?

15:46.633 --> 15:48.596
It looked like James.

15:48.621 --> 15:50.776
James is in prison.

15:51.948 --> 15:53.825
Yes I know.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.252
And even if a miracle came out ...

15:58.314 --> 16:02.564
... I doubt if he can walk. You turned the man into coal.

16:15.928 --> 16:17.629
Are you sure you're okay?

16:20.318 --> 16:21.610
Yes.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.067
Are you taking your medicine?

16:26.650 --> 16:28.022
Yes.

16:28.713 --> 16:31.399
Yes but...?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.525
I still see delusions sometimes.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.179
My God.

16:37.678 --> 16:41.590
Don't talk to the parole officer or doctor about them.

16:41.691 --> 16:44.829
- I'm not talking. - You can't get out of your life.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.457
Do you think I'll be okay?

16:50.723 --> 16:53.683
Listen, you've had a lot.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.379
How is it, I can't imagine.

16:57.772 --> 17:01.220
But you can't live in the past.

17:02.092 --> 17:05.521
You slept as much as you could, what happened.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.623
You have to look ahead.

17:09.420 --> 17:10.634
Yes.

17:12.048 --> 17:13.445
You are right.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.971
Everything will be fine.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.487
Come on, let's get out of here.

17:57.674 --> 18:00.679
Hello? - I'm glad you put on the phone.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.820
I said I was going to wear it.

18:05.035 --> 18:06.296
Well done, Mary.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.668
- I hope everything will be fine. - Thank you.

18:09.832 --> 18:11.101
Bye.

18:27.476 --> 18:29.409
Yeah, Tom?

18:29.721 --> 18:32.010
You watched my daughter die.

18:34.259 --> 18:37.082
I'm going to watch your death now.

19:15.243 --> 19:17.243
Hi.

19:34.801 --> 19:36.777
Rain is expected tonight.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.987
Mary.

19:40.338 --> 19:42.467
We've talked about this before.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.165
You can't panic every time it rains.

19:47.845 --> 19:50.947
Do you know the song called "Raindrops" in the 50s?

19:51.598 --> 19:53.187
No.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.696
Raindrops.

19:58.562 --> 20:01.303
Many raindrops.

20:01.962 --> 20:03.938
It's like raindrops ...

20:03.963 --> 20:06.363
OK, please. Stop saying.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.114
Yeah, I know that song.

20:11.994 --> 20:15.926
James calls me whenever it rains and ...

20:17.369 --> 20:19.707
... he played that song on the phone.

20:23.176 --> 20:25.978
I knew it would kill someone.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.935
God, that's a terrible thing.

20:33.955 --> 20:36.945
Is that why you don't want a phone?

20:38.929 --> 20:40.833
It's one of many reasons.

20:44.690 --> 20:47.979
You were the only one with me in this time.

20:51.022 --> 20:54.573
I couldn't have done any of this without you.

20:57.087 --> 20:58.969
So thank you.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.031
No need to thank me.

21:02.645 --> 21:06.082
We have been friends since the age of five. You're like one of my family.

21:07.940 --> 21:10.209
I never turn my back on you.

21:11.957 --> 21:14.199
I know what everyone says about me.

21:14.224 --> 21:16.420
What do I say to them, you know?

21:16.892 --> 21:18.945
What? - Fuck you.

21:43.959 --> 21:46.496
Are you sure you want to work here?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.698
I have no choice.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.704
This place is in a deserted place.

21:56.886 --> 21:59.421
I don't like you being alone here.

21:59.766 --> 22:01.391
Nothing happens.

22:02.285 --> 22:04.369
What are you doing?

22:04.763 --> 22:08.519
I'm coming too. How should I see this scum from the inside.

22:25.732 --> 22:27.732
- Hi. - May I help you?

22:27.777 --> 22:29.308
Ben Mary.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.958
I was going to start tonight.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.296
Right, right. Hello, I'm Bobby.

22:37.321 --> 22:38.691
- Hi. - Hi.

22:38.716 --> 22:40.864
- This is Deb. - Hi.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.904
- Do you sell beer? - Yeah, at the back.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.445
Ed said he would work at a gas station for the first time.

22:50.605 --> 22:52.440
- Yes. - OK.

22:52.465 --> 22:55.550
It's pretty simple. So don't worry.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.195
- Do you want to come over here and look? - Yes.

23:01.129 --> 23:05.548
This cash register. This is a barcode reader.

23:05.807 --> 23:09.625
You read the barcode and press this button and this button.

23:09.747 --> 23:13.989
And those who buy gasoline need to come in. Because the pumps are old, not automatic.

23:15.706 --> 23:17.575
I will also buy a pack of cigarettes.

23:17.819 --> 23:19.311
OK.

23:20.378 --> 23:22.754
Identity check is precise because 12 at once.

23:22.778 --> 23:25.458
... I was in trouble because I was selling a cigarette to someone aged.

23:25.752 --> 23:28.604
- You sold a cigarette to a 12-year-old boy? - Yes.

23:28.858 --> 23:32.483
Yes, but he had breasts. So I'm confused.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.706
Do you want to spend what you bought?

23:39.485 --> 23:41.740
- Of course. - All right.

23:43.111 --> 23:45.299
Ask if he's credit card or debit card.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.401
Is that a credit or debit card?

23:47.437 --> 23:49.256
- ATM card. - OK.

23:50.167 --> 23:53.167
It keeps 9.75.

24:00.616 --> 24:03.655
You see, it's that simple. Bravo.

24:03.702 --> 24:05.382
- Yes. - All right.

24:05.407 --> 24:09.311
I'll get you a key and let the rest of the shop go.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.135
- OK. - OK.

24:16.149 --> 24:17.691
Sweet man.

24:17.808 --> 24:20.273
For someone working at the gas station.

24:20.826 --> 24:24.060
Will you stay here all night?

24:24.247 --> 24:26.216
No, I'm going.

24:26.317 --> 24:29.091
I wanted to make sure everything was okay.

24:29.637 --> 24:31.418
Everything is OK.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.430
Then I will call and check you.

24:34.455 --> 24:35.650
OK.

24:37.548 --> 24:39.205
And don't be too drunk.

24:39.522 --> 24:41.030
You have to get me at 6 o'clock.

24:41.059 --> 24:43.493
When was I so drunk?

24:49.672 --> 24:55.383
Translation: aytug2001

25:26.730 --> 25:28.195
Fuck!

25:53.087 --> 25:55.103
We only have five channels.

25:55.772 --> 25:59.043
No problem. I won't be watching TV that much.

25:59.339 --> 26:05.193
Now it is but you will beg to find a fictitious series at 3 o'clock at night.

26:05.575 --> 26:07.294
Believe me.

26:07.553 --> 26:10.803
Okay. Here are the keys to the shop.

26:10.828 --> 26:14.147
This opens the round front door, okay?

26:14.172 --> 26:17.991
So when you leave the market, you will use this to lock the door.

26:18.104 --> 26:22.005
This weak opens the back door and the sink door.

26:22.030 --> 26:24.834
I keep that door closed all the time.

26:26.214 --> 26:27.744
What is that for?

26:28.566 --> 26:30.273
What do you think it is for?

26:30.850 --> 26:32.514
The sink outside?

26:34.064 --> 26:35.763
You learn fast.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.525
Well, I think these are enough.

26:40.754 --> 26:43.140
I think you're ready for your first night.

26:44.082 --> 26:47.699
It will be a stagnant night. It's always on Mondays.

26:55.089 --> 26:58.997
If you have a problem call me, okay?

26:59.382 --> 27:02.120
Ed everything later in the night ...

27:02.144 --> 27:04.883
... wants me to check if it's okay.

27:04.937 --> 27:07.765
- OK. - Any other problems before you go?

27:10.613 --> 27:13.175
Has this place ever been robbed?

27:15.454 --> 27:18.495
Thing...

27:21.971 --> 27:24.073
Only by me.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.069
You can eat and drink anything you want.

27:27.163 --> 27:31.255
Just keep your hands away from these babies.

27:31.303 --> 27:33.568
- I do not want it, thanks. - OK.

27:33.713 --> 27:36.908
Ed doesn't know, just throw the trash in the back.

27:39.621 --> 27:41.949
And if you smoke, smoke outside.

27:42.346 --> 27:43.589
OK.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.377
I think that's it.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.683
See you later, Mary.

27:49.817 --> 27:51.261
Ll see.

27:54.702 --> 27:56.604
I hate the rain.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.223
Disgusting.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.251
The brain is ready.

29:27.957 --> 29:30.206
- The patient is also ready. - Beautiful.

32:27.793 --> 32:29.121
Hi?

33:28.539 --> 33:30.241
Deer gas station. I'm Mary.

33:30.266 --> 33:31.890
How long are you open until night?

33:32.235 --> 33:34.898
- We are open 24 hours. - Thank you.

33:49.017 --> 33:52.227
- Deer gas station. I'm Mary. - How long are you open until night?

33:53.639 --> 33:55.482
Didn't you just call?

34:20.987 --> 34:23.011
Deer gas station. I'm Mary.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.043
How long are you open until night?

34:25.369 --> 34:28.049
- Call anyway ... - You like watching people die.

34:56.725 --> 34:59.132
Hi, I'm Debbie. Thank you for calling.

34:59.157 --> 35:01.437
Hi, Deb. Just me.

35:01.982 --> 35:05.540
Would you call me at the number I left? I need to talk to you.

36:18.114 --> 36:19.731
Behave yourself.

36:35.272 --> 36:36.842
Damn it.

36:55.332 --> 36:56.492
Hi.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.068
- Hi. - Ed here?

36:58.491 --> 37:00.275
No, it won't be until morning.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.206
I will fill it. Diesel.

37:06.961 --> 37:09.226
Pump number two?

37:09.542 --> 37:11.237
Yes, ma'am.

37:12.321 --> 37:13.938
OK.

37:50.961 --> 37:52.937
A bad night to be out.

37:53.097 --> 37:55.394
Let me say that much.

37:56.081 --> 37:58.136
I've never seen you here before.

37:58.286 --> 38:00.560
This is my first night.

38:01.982 --> 38:03.474
Did you like it?

38:03.753 --> 38:05.550
Yes good.

38:05.716 --> 38:08.286
So why is this here? Are you a student or something?

38:08.408 --> 38:09.611
No.

38:12.148 --> 38:14.976
It was time to hire a beautiful person.

38:16.511 --> 38:19.893
Why a beautiful woman like you ...

38:20.978 --> 38:22.720
... works in such a dump?

38:23.417 --> 38:24.800
I needed work.

38:25.457 --> 38:27.605
Let your boyfriend look at you.

38:27.854 --> 38:29.546
I do not have a boyfriend.

38:33.190 --> 38:35.291
How come?

38:35.387 --> 38:39.703
Because I tried to kill him. Got 159.75, please.

38:44.779 --> 38:47.764
Damn it. I think I am falling in love.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.847
- Is it a debit card or a credit card? - Credit.

38:54.974 --> 38:58.208
If you get tired of not having a man with you,

38:59.101 --> 39:01.343
... I don't sleep for 24 hours.

39:02.529 --> 39:06.051
Thank you, but I won't be dating anyone for a while.

39:10.468 --> 39:12.671
Pity on those machines.

39:29.691 --> 39:31.055
Damn it!

39:35.278 --> 39:37.755
You forgot your credit card!

40:09.722 --> 40:12.295
Oh my God!

40:14.387 --> 40:18.032
- What are you doing here? - I called you but you did not hear.

40:18.152 --> 40:19.468
Yes, I did not hear.

40:19.493 --> 40:22.879
- What are you doing outside? Someone forgot his credit card.

40:23.615 --> 40:25.662
- Damn it. - God, your lip is bleeding.

40:25.687 --> 40:28.634
Yeah what happened, you punched my face. - Sorry.

40:28.925 --> 40:31.300
- Let's go inside. - Yes.

40:35.212 --> 40:37.673
He had a solid right crochet.

40:37.966 --> 40:41.177
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

40:41.202 --> 40:43.419
I wouldn't want to be that person.

40:43.643 --> 40:44.862
Yes.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.870
You would not want.

40:48.786 --> 40:50.747
Do you hurt?

40:51.010 --> 40:52.509
No problem.

40:52.985 --> 40:54.376
Sorry.

40:57.498 --> 41:00.483
So what are you doing here?

41:00.802 --> 41:03.927
Ed asked me to come and look at you.

41:06.626 --> 41:08.069
How's it going?

41:08.094 --> 41:12.123
I had one customer.

41:14.494 --> 41:15.521
Do you know him?

41:15.546 --> 41:19.036
- A big, tall, bald man driving a truck. - Yes, he is.

41:19.107 --> 41:21.941
Yes, he deliberately left him here.

41:22.199 --> 41:24.199
Why would he do something like that?

41:24.340 --> 41:29.277
Because Ed had slept with this girl until he hit him.

41:31.178 --> 41:34.108
How can someone sleep with him?

41:35.171 --> 41:37.038
He gave him money.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.710
Disgusting.

41:40.993 --> 41:43.078
They were doing it in that chair.

41:51.351 --> 41:53.343
How is everything going?

41:57.625 --> 41:59.109
I'm fine.

41:59.872 --> 42:01.942
Ed told me he went to jail.

42:03.361 --> 42:04.970
Right.

42:05.079 --> 42:07.759
So that's why he asked you to look at me.

42:08.199 --> 42:09.934
To make sure I'm not stealing anything.

42:09.959 --> 42:12.980
No, he just wondered if everything is fine.

42:13.826 --> 42:14.928
Eee?

42:15.537 --> 42:18.092
Looking from here looks fine.

42:24.946 --> 42:27.211
Can i ask you a question?

42:29.685 --> 42:30.982
Of course.

42:31.716 --> 42:35.114
Why did you burn your boyfriend?

42:43.833 --> 42:46.021
I think the news spread immediately.

42:52.886 --> 42:54.816
Do you really want to know?

42:55.746 --> 42:57.668
Do you want to talk?

43:00.741 --> 43:02.601
Not really.

43:03.491 --> 43:05.171
Well.

43:09.111 --> 43:11.158
My boyfriend...

43:13.159 --> 43:15.456
...James Lincoln Fields idi.

43:17.063 --> 43:18.626
Did you fall in the rain?

43:20.808 --> 43:21.988
Yes.

43:22.624 --> 43:25.616
- He killed 30 women. - 35.

43:29.287 --> 43:32.029
So you're the "audience" too.

43:32.774 --> 43:34.063
Yes.

43:35.570 --> 43:37.289
The press told me that.

43:39.616 --> 43:42.201
Did you watch all those girls getting killed?

43:44.252 --> 43:45.900
Not all of them.

43:46.987 --> 43:49.002
What kind of feeling did he have?

43:54.473 --> 43:56.481
As if I want to die.

44:01.429 --> 44:03.858
I still want to die every day.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.992
- You don't have to talk about them. - No problem.

44:10.399 --> 44:12.547
How did you learn?

44:13.875 --> 44:16.434
- Did you ... - Did you kill someone?

44:21.571 --> 44:23.454
Can I take a sip of that?

44:24.985 --> 44:26.274
Thank you.

44:39.329 --> 44:41.775
One night I came home from work.

44:42.474 --> 44:43.966
And...

44:45.574 --> 44:47.145
The house smelled.

44:48.104 --> 44:49.526
So bad.

44:52.889 --> 44:55.850
An animal or a clogged sewer pipe ...

44:56.606 --> 44:59.349
I thought ...

45:01.385 --> 45:05.059
I went down to the basement and ...

45:08.425 --> 45:10.175
... flooded all over.

45:15.336 --> 45:17.203
Koku ...

45:18.635 --> 45:20.939
... seemed unbearable, so ...

45:22.310 --> 45:25.279
... I was about to go upstairs to call James.

45:26.492 --> 45:27.968
Later...

45:30.501 --> 45:32.419
I saw corpse pieces.

45:36.131 --> 45:37.764
Then I got it.

45:38.356 --> 45:42.950
He buried corpses under our house.

45:44.422 --> 45:47.086
I turned my back to call James.

45:49.902 --> 45:51.902
He was waiting for me.

45:54.702 --> 45:56.784
Did you understand the situation?

46:01.658 --> 46:05.759
I always knew something was happening, but ...

46:08.747 --> 46:11.145
I guess I didn't want to believe it.

46:24.294 --> 46:25.747
What did you do next?

46:29.989 --> 46:31.107
Nothing.

46:33.567 --> 46:35.958
I remained an audience to what happened.

46:37.192 --> 46:40.896
Why didn't you run or go to the cops?

46:43.615 --> 46:45.388
He said he would kill me.

46:46.275 --> 46:48.267
And my whole family.

46:50.775 --> 46:53.822
I'm not making excuses for what I did, but ...

46:56.151 --> 46:57.860
I was young.

46:58.619 --> 47:00.499
And I was scared.

47:02.251 --> 47:04.610
What else I could do, I didn't know.

47:11.989 --> 47:14.051
After that, he made me watch.

47:17.414 --> 47:19.430
What happened when you stopped watching?

47:21.257 --> 47:24.593
His name was Christine Rogers.

47:27.672 --> 47:29.469
He was very young.

47:30.071 --> 47:33.555
After that, I didn't want to live anymore.

47:35.332 --> 47:36.808
So ...

47:38.485 --> 47:40.268
While he was sleeping ...

47:42.082 --> 47:44.065
I set the house on fire.

47:46.926 --> 47:48.652
When you're in it?

47:55.783 --> 47:57.751
Still alive, right?

48:01.379 --> 48:03.121
Why rain?

48:04.113 --> 48:06.862
So that their spirits can be cleaned.

48:16.957 --> 48:18.871
I was very ill.

48:21.730 --> 48:24.136
What is not real ...

48:25.384 --> 48:27.264
... I couldn't distinguish.

48:30.272 --> 48:33.991
I saw the victims everywhere.

48:36.498 --> 48:38.388
How are you now?

48:42.395 --> 48:44.325
Good day or bad.

48:46.443 --> 48:48.224
But I'm getting better.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.953
It's good to hear that.

49:00.410 --> 49:02.027
These...

49:02.830 --> 49:06.104
... if you don't tell anyone?

49:06.725 --> 49:09.881
Although I don't say that, people already learn somehow.

49:10.785 --> 49:12.253
Yes.

49:14.651 --> 49:16.261
I have to go.

49:17.634 --> 49:19.806
- OK. - No trouble, I hope?

49:20.719 --> 49:22.289
Yes.

49:27.979 --> 49:30.448
Do you have anything to ask before you go?

49:33.430 --> 49:35.594
Did anyone really eat from those?

49:36.404 --> 49:37.958
Of these?

49:41.588 --> 49:43.026
Let's see.

49:54.163 --> 49:56.281
You don't realize what you're missing.

49:56.306 --> 49:58.132
My God.

49:58.779 --> 50:00.193
So disgusting.

50:03.892 --> 50:06.203
Thanks for the pork tongue, Mary.

50:06.396 --> 50:08.740
I will tell Ed that he is fine.

50:09.831 --> 50:12.417
- Thank you. - See you, Mary.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.281
Ll see.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.813
Do you have a sink?

50:37.060 --> 50:39.380
Yeah, outside.

50:40.474 --> 50:41.700
Come on.

50:51.729 --> 50:53.190
Damn it.

50:57.448 --> 50:58.916
Fuck!

51:04.778 --> 51:07.251
- Have you got an ID? - Yes there is.

51:12.817 --> 51:15.294
Thank you, Tom. - No problem.

51:21.527 --> 51:24.668
It costs $ 11.

51:25.140 --> 51:27.007
- Get it. - Thank you.

51:28.719 --> 51:29.938
Here you go.

51:31.117 --> 51:32.422
Excuse me.

51:34.548 --> 51:36.251
Deer gas station. I'm Mary.

51:36.283 --> 51:38.760
♪kie Rain drops ♪

51:42.253 --> 51:43.592
Are you all right, ma'am?

51:43.617 --> 51:47.756
Let me tell you, your sink is completely flooded.

51:51.810 --> 51:53.162
Lets go.

52:01.744 --> 52:03.010
Damn it!

52:03.919 --> 52:05.122
Fuck!

52:37.435 --> 52:38.713
Wonderful.

54:37.706 --> 54:39.104
Help me!

54:48.092 --> 54:51.021
Why don't you help?

54:53.626 --> 54:55.340
This is not real.

54:55.676 --> 54:56.910
You are not real.

54:57.108 --> 54:59.425
You are not real. You are not real.

54:59.512 --> 55:01.949
You are not real. You are not real.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.451
You are not real.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.134
What are you looking here?

56:06.159 --> 56:08.725
I was passing by, I said, "How are you?"

56:09.754 --> 56:11.493
It's a late hour to be out, isn't it?

56:11.518 --> 56:13.231
I don't sleep much.

56:13.522 --> 56:16.963
- Phones are not working here? - You don't have to check me up.

56:16.988 --> 56:18.893
I have no control over you.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.532
Ed called me and asked a few questions about you.

56:21.619 --> 56:22.971
Wonderful.

56:23.275 --> 56:24.931
Did you tell him everything?

56:26.347 --> 56:28.699
Look, why don't you send me back?

56:28.777 --> 56:30.276
Is that what you want?

56:31.109 --> 56:34.977
For your information, I told him that he was a good person who fell bad.

56:35.101 --> 56:37.616
And now that you're trying to streamline your life.

56:38.076 --> 56:39.295
Thank you.

56:39.423 --> 56:40.821
Are you okay?

56:41.757 --> 56:43.030
I'm fine.

56:46.082 --> 56:48.253
I'll use the sink, where?

56:49.131 --> 56:51.092
Outside is unusable.

56:51.566 --> 56:53.318
You will have to use the back.

56:53.343 --> 56:55.315
The thin key opens the door.

56:56.258 --> 56:57.680
Thank you.

57:13.102 --> 57:14.571
May I help you?

57:27.273 --> 57:28.804
Hello, Mary.

57:29.186 --> 57:30.670
You are not real.

57:31.224 --> 57:32.676
You are not real.

57:33.332 --> 57:34.715
You are not real.

57:43.987 --> 57:45.135
I'm real.

57:55.087 --> 57:57.986
I heard them release you, I said let me come and see how you are.

58:01.622 --> 58:03.747
You still think I'm not real, right?

58:06.735 --> 58:09.126
Do you still see things you don't want to believe?

58:12.559 --> 58:15.504
You're just like me, Mary. He liked to watch them die.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.668
I'm not like you.

58:17.938 --> 58:19.602
You are worse.

58:20.749 --> 58:23.921
You could stop me but you didn't.

58:25.055 --> 58:26.938
You let people die.

58:27.827 --> 58:29.960
To the death of innocent people.

58:30.266 --> 58:33.485
- I was ill. You still believe your own lies.

58:35.616 --> 58:36.944
Still.

58:40.221 --> 58:42.158
These are not happening.

58:45.044 --> 58:47.317
Tonight you will watch people die.

58:49.125 --> 58:52.117
And I bet every claim ...

58:52.619 --> 58:55.780
... you will like it. Later...

58:57.966 --> 58:59.864
I will watch you die.

59:02.614 --> 59:04.489
There is nothing you can do for this.

59:10.035 --> 59:12.464
My parole officer is at the back.

59:12.692 --> 59:14.445
Do you think I'm not aware of this?

59:14.685 --> 59:16.920
I'll tell him.

59:20.556 --> 59:22.119
What if I'm not real?

59:25.280 --> 59:27.595
They'll shut you in forever, Mary.

59:31.038 --> 59:32.827
I know it's not real.

59:34.319 --> 59:36.404
And I will prove it to you.

59:50.330 --> 59:52.228
I was going to buy gas.

59:53.339 --> 59:54.503
Of course.

59:54.651 --> 59:57.534
Can I get $ 10 on pump number three?

59:58.245 --> 59:59.573
Well.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.730
There is bad rain outside.

01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:06.072
Yes.

01:00:07.155 --> 01:00:09.678
Your money's worth.

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:12.175
Thank you.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:15.196
How long are you open until night?

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:24.313
Why do you keep calling me?

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:25.724
How so?

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:28.062
You called me before.

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.136
I know it was you.

01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:33.963
- I'm sorry, do I know you? - You know me!

01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:36.439
What do you want!

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:38.972
I think you confused me with someone else, dear.

01:00:38.997 --> 01:00:41.431
Don't lie. I am aware of everything.

01:00:41.456 --> 01:00:43.724
I am aware of every shit.

01:00:43.749 --> 01:00:46.924
- What's going on? This woman called me all night.

01:00:46.949 --> 01:00:49.104
I don't know what he's talking about.

01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:51.283
- He's one of them. - Who's that, Mary?

01:00:52.485 --> 01:00:55.760
Someone keeps calling and threatening me.

01:00:55.809 --> 01:00:57.582
Are you sure it's that woman?

01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:02.268
- I do not know I do not know. - Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:02.293 --> 01:01:05.063
Because I am paranoid and delusional, remember.

01:01:05.088 --> 01:01:07.250
You should have told me.

01:01:08.854 --> 01:01:11.462
Look, you have to tell me everything and be honest with me.

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:14.185
Only in this way can we get somewhere.

01:01:15.459 --> 01:01:17.756
- Do you understand? - OK.

01:01:20.095 --> 01:01:21.580
It's late.

01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:26.538
Goodnight.

01:01:28.993 --> 01:01:30.328
Thank you.

01:01:51.079 --> 01:01:52.688
Debbie?

01:02:39.739 --> 01:02:43.166
You like watching.

01:03:33.066 --> 01:03:35.347
Tom Doogan's phone. Leave your name and number.

01:03:36.385 --> 01:03:38.745
Tom, you have to call me.

01:03:39.403 --> 01:03:40.942
I think something is happening.

01:03:41.243 --> 01:03:43.204
Please call me.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.718
911.

01:03:59.596 --> 01:04:01.330
Mary, nothing.

01:04:02.837 --> 01:04:04.306
Everything is OK.

01:04:04.706 --> 01:04:06.058
There is nothing.

01:04:12.277 --> 01:04:15.357
Hello? - This is an emergency call center.

01:04:15.537 --> 01:04:17.451
We received a call from this number.

01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:20.845
Sorry, I thought I turned it off before I connected.

01:04:21.249 --> 01:04:22.638
Do you have an emergency?

01:04:22.663 --> 01:04:25.686
No, I didn't want to call. Sorry.

01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:15.661
- If you want to make a call ... - Shit!

01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:07.866
You are not real.

01:07:08.288 --> 01:07:09.906
You are not real.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.619
Help.

01:07:35.859 --> 01:07:39.363
- Please help. - Calm down.

01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:41.677
We must call the police.

01:07:42.411 --> 01:07:44.012
It will kill me.

01:07:44.085 --> 01:07:47.809
- Everything is OK. - No, you don't understand.

01:07:48.867 --> 01:07:51.003
Fuck! The phone is still not working.

01:07:58.967 --> 01:08:00.842
Do you remember him?

01:08:09.224 --> 01:08:11.980
He was only 18 years old.

01:08:12.818 --> 01:08:15.186
The university was in first grade.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.484
He would be a doctor.

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:25.953
But you and that beast got all this from him.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.328
I did not do.

01:08:28.531 --> 01:08:32.865
You watched her while killing my daughter.

01:08:45.908 --> 01:08:48.046
When I heard they release you ...

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:50.425
I had to come and do something.

01:10:57.969 --> 01:10:59.821
No! No!

01:11:06.545 --> 01:11:08.615
- Are you okay? - Yes.

01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:09.899
Damn it.

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:22.415
- Is he dead? - Yes.

01:11:23.267 --> 01:11:25.353
I tried to call you, but the phones are cut.

01:11:25.528 --> 01:11:27.020
I know.

01:11:28.072 --> 01:11:30.619
She said I killed her daughter.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.331
İsmi Carol Rogers.

01:11:34.034 --> 01:11:36.041
Her daughter's name was Christine.

01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:37.463
No.

01:11:43.628 --> 01:11:46.034
Will nobody forgive me?

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.569
No.

01:11:53.506 --> 01:11:54.506
Fuck.

01:11:54.531 --> 01:11:55.853
What?

01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:58.257
We must reach the cops.

01:11:59.537 --> 01:12:01.146
Why did you come back?

01:12:02.467 --> 01:12:04.902
- I have something to tell you. What?

01:12:05.645 --> 01:12:08.169
- Come on, we're leaving. - No, tell me what happened.

01:12:08.573 --> 01:12:10.424
There was an accident in prison.

01:12:10.851 --> 01:12:12.281
What kind of accident?

01:12:12.388 --> 01:12:14.521
A major storm cut off the electricity.

01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:17.020
Some prisoners fled.

01:12:17.444 --> 01:12:19.483
James is one of those escaped prisoners.

01:12:21.597 --> 01:12:23.058
Was that real?

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.023
They didn't want me to tell you because they didn't think you could chase it.

01:12:27.508 --> 01:12:28.977
He was here.

01:12:29.903 --> 01:12:31.020
Born?

01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:34.753
No!

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:43.865
No. Making.

01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:14.149
No! No!

01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:15.798
No!

01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:17.901
No!

01:13:20.788 --> 01:13:23.546
No! No!

01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:26.018
No!

01:13:59.777 --> 01:14:01.988
I told you I was real.

01:14:04.216 --> 01:14:07.037
I apologize for hurt you. Are you okay?

01:14:12.388 --> 01:14:14.364
I was watching you.

01:14:20.408 --> 01:14:23.165
I really thought that wife would kill you.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.376
But Tom did me a favor.

01:14:35.609 --> 01:14:38.023
He killed her so I wouldn't have to kill.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.959
Now we are together again.

01:14:44.444 --> 01:14:46.092
Just like the old days.

01:14:48.122 --> 01:14:49.754
What are you going to do?

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.125
You know what to do.

01:14:52.633 --> 01:14:53.953
No.

01:14:54.492 --> 01:14:55.843
Please do not.

01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:09.517
You don't have to do this.

01:15:10.197 --> 01:15:11.621
Yes, it is necessary.

01:15:33.348 --> 01:15:35.058
I trusted you.

01:15:36.767 --> 01:15:38.853
In return, you did these to me.

01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:41.238
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

01:15:41.533 --> 01:15:43.072
You should be.

01:15:44.228 --> 01:15:46.047
No.

01:15:53.457 --> 01:15:55.153
Watch me, Mary.

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.209
- No. - Watch!

01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:28.299
- Watch me, Mary. - No.

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:29.727
No.

01:16:30.146 --> 01:16:31.326
No.

01:16:52.247 --> 01:16:55.592
No Please. Please do not. Please.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.277
Please.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.583
- Please stop. - Tell me you Love Me.

01:17:02.104 --> 01:17:03.439
No.

01:17:04.435 --> 01:17:06.606
Say that you love me and he won't die.

01:17:13.326 --> 01:17:14.849
I love you.

01:17:15.153 --> 01:17:16.645
I love you too.

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:30.477
I love you much.

01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:35.737
I do all this for you, you know?

01:18:25.771 --> 01:18:27.818
You like watching, right?

01:18:32.724 --> 01:18:33.949
Said.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:37.122
No.

01:18:40.005 --> 01:18:42.172
You're disappointing me, Mary.

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:50.911
You like watching people burn, right?

01:18:52.049 --> 01:18:53.752
Fuck.

01:19:19.817 --> 01:19:22.032
We will be together again soon.

01:19:22.097 --> 01:19:25.659
I will never be with you.

01:19:30.498 --> 01:19:32.018
Help!

01:19:32.086 --> 01:19:33.984
Help!

01:20:25.378 --> 01:20:26.792
Let's.

01:20:29.598 --> 01:20:31.824
- Ed is holding a gun in his closet. What?

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.595
In your closet. Number 37. Right there.

01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:36.806
Go get it, go get it before it comes back.

01:20:37.868 --> 01:20:40.001
- With a lock on it. - OK.

01:20:40.693 --> 01:20:43.110
- Do you have the key? - No. - Shit.

01:20:45.018 --> 01:20:47.557
Mary, Mary. There's a pipe over there.

01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:49.671
There's a pipe over there.

01:20:58.008 --> 01:20:59.493
Hi?

01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:25.734
Hey sweetie. Are you here?

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:28.447
You have my credit card.

01:21:28.816 --> 01:21:31.485
See that little knob on the gun?

01:21:31.884 --> 01:21:33.508
From there, the rifle opens.

01:21:35.874 --> 01:21:37.569
Put two cartridges inside.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:40.412
Well done to my daughter.

01:21:41.957 --> 01:21:43.050
Those et.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.253
Those et. Those.

01:22:11.964 --> 01:22:13.362
Damn it.

01:22:14.901 --> 01:22:16.448
Damn it.

01:22:18.289 --> 01:22:20.433
Untie my hands, unfasten my hands.

01:22:21.826 --> 01:22:23.060
Git.

01:22:25.613 --> 01:22:27.658
Come on come on.

01:22:33.265 --> 01:22:35.547
911, please report your emergency.

01:22:35.604 --> 01:22:38.215
I'm at the Deer gas station on highway 6.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.464
I think someone might have robbed this place.

01:22:41.148 --> 01:22:43.195
You'd better send a vehicle here.

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:46.048
Sir, please stay in your car until the authorities arrive.

01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:49.113
Okay.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:14.097
Point the rifle towards the door.

01:23:14.387 --> 01:23:16.634
Pull the trigger as soon as you get inside.

01:23:18.099 --> 01:23:19.653
I will not die here.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:22.036
I will not die here.

01:23:27.568 --> 01:23:29.629
I have to pick you up at 6 o'clock.

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.930
Hold the gun like this.

01:23:42.792 --> 01:23:44.652
As soon as he comes in ...

01:23:45.126 --> 01:23:46.532
...download it.

01:24:08.874 --> 01:24:10.147
Damn it.

01:24:10.362 --> 01:24:12.410
- Hold it to the door. - OK.

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:42.397
Come on, bastard.

01:25:03.564 --> 01:25:05.588
- I shot him. - Let's.

01:25:18.582 --> 01:25:19.910
No.

01:25:27.374 --> 01:25:28.881
It wasn't.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.575
I shot someone.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.648
It's not your fault.

01:25:37.893 --> 01:25:39.292
You did not know.

01:25:39.326 --> 01:25:41.537
I did it, I pulled the trigger.

01:25:41.965 --> 01:25:43.810
Give me the gun.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.141
Fireworks. Let's.

01:25:50.761 --> 01:25:52.923
It's always my fault.

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:10.292
If he enters the door, I will blow his head.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:13.895
No, we can't stay here.

01:26:14.743 --> 01:26:16.226
We're dead.

01:26:16.344 --> 01:26:17.766
Let's.

01:26:39.151 --> 01:26:41.166
Stay near me.

01:26:42.481 --> 01:26:46.450
- How many bullets do we have? - Two.

01:26:47.008 --> 01:26:49.098
Okay okay.

01:27:07.699 --> 01:27:09.652
- The cops are here. - Yes.

01:27:09.738 --> 01:27:12.019
All right, let's go.

01:27:29.354 --> 01:27:31.062
Fuck.

01:27:42.933 --> 01:27:47.561
I'm officer Collins. Coal Bank road, I'm at Deer gas station.

01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:50.255
I answer the 911 call.

01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:53.070
I'll go out and take a look.

01:27:58.504 --> 01:28:01.444
- Squat on the ground. Place. - Please. Help.

01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:02.960
- Please help me. - Calm down.

01:28:02.985 --> 01:28:04.430
Is there anyone else inside?

01:28:04.835 --> 01:28:07.857
Yes. Coming, we need to go right away.

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.053
Stand up.

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.753
Slowly.

01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:13.207
Tell me what's going on.

01:28:13.482 --> 01:28:14.795
He's in the shop.

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.536
Who's in the shop?

01:28:16.742 --> 01:28:18.453
James Lincoln Fields.

01:28:18.697 --> 01:28:20.517
It's after me.

01:28:20.682 --> 01:28:22.572
Get in the car, get in the car.

01:28:34.787 --> 01:28:36.271
I'm officer Collins ...

01:28:36.296 --> 01:28:37.578
No! No!

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:30.816
Translation: aytug2001

01:29:38.637 --> 01:29:40.231
Hi?

01:29:59.032 --> 01:30:00.759
Hi?

01:32:36.057 --> 01:32:37.890
Stop! Stop!

01:32:39.047 --> 01:32:40.874
Stop, please! Stop!

01:33:36.136 --> 01:33:37.745
Mary!

01:33:43.056 --> 01:33:44.216
Fuck!

01:34:10.722 --> 01:34:12.472
Stay with me.

01:34:24.293 --> 01:34:26.871
I'm not going anywhere without you, Mary.

01:34:36.152 --> 01:34:38.224
It's time to go, dear.

01:36:32.514 --> 01:36:34.959
911, please report your emergency.

01:36:46.094 --> 01:36:47.563
I love you.
