WEBVTT

00:08.995 --> 00:09.800
Hello.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.325
Oh, hey, Julia;
I was just on my way over.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.679
Anything I need to bring?

00:14.746 --> 00:17.137
Thai food, wine, batteries?

00:19.612 --> 00:21.466
What do you mean, "Don't come"?

00:23.448 --> 00:25.223
Gee, do you really think
your psychiatrist

00:25.223 --> 00:27.531
is the best judge
of who you should sleep with?

00:29.488 --> 00:30.799
Well, sure you could do better.

00:30.799 --> 00:32.261
We could both do better.

00:33.445 --> 00:35.705
But in the meantime,
I am on my way over.

00:36.554 --> 00:38.615
Okay, okay, need
to stop you here.

00:38.615 --> 00:39.778
There is a big difference

00:39.845 --> 00:41.743
between "meaningless"
and "degrading."

00:44.371 --> 00:45.111
You know what?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.269
I think we just have
to agree to disagree.

00:48.345 --> 00:50.883
Okay, then,
you have a nice life, too.

00:54.646 --> 00:56.880
Why do these women
insist on getting well?

00:57.945 --> 01:00.245
Hey, Alan...
Hang on, Charlie.

01:00.312 --> 01:02.178
This is an
important moment,

01:02.245 --> 01:03.978
and I want
to savor it.

01:05.643 --> 01:07.436
Alan...

01:07.646 --> 01:08.955
J.

01:10.045 --> 01:11.514
Harper.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.145
What's the big deal?
It's just an alimony check.

01:16.212 --> 01:18.112
<i>Not an alimony check.</i>

01:18.178 --> 01:22.317
This is my final alimony check.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.850
Isn't it beautiful?

01:26.045 --> 01:27.245
Oh, wait.

01:27.312 --> 01:28.579
Judith is getting married
this weekend.

01:28.646 --> 01:29.612
Exactly.

01:29.679 --> 01:31.073
And you know
what that means.

01:31.074 --> 01:33.379
You can finally kick in
a few bucks around here?

01:35.212 --> 01:36.896
Good one. No.

01:37.712 --> 01:40.279
It means Alan gets
new underwear.

01:42.145 --> 01:45.178
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go pick up my son

01:45.245 --> 01:47.255
and deliver this last drop
of blood money

01:47.255 --> 01:49.545
to the former Mrs. Alan Harper

01:49.612 --> 01:51.811
and soon-to-be
Mrs. Herb Melnick.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.314
May God have
mercy on his soul.

01:57.746 --> 01:58.746
Amen.

02:00.877 --> 02:02.078
So, you want
some company?

02:02.145 --> 02:03.445
You want to come
with me?

02:03.512 --> 02:05.612
Eh, why not?
I don't have
any plans.

02:05.679 --> 02:06.869
You got stood up
again, didn't you?

02:08.741 --> 02:10.078
I'm starting to think
all these girls

02:10.145 --> 02:12.212
have the same
damn shrink.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.679
All right, well, if you're
gonna come, grab your camera.

02:14.746 --> 02:16.186
You can take some snapshots
of Pharaoh Judith

02:16.186 --> 02:17.551
letting her Alan go.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.550
Got the camera right here.

02:20.612 --> 02:22.379
You carry it with you?

02:22.445 --> 02:24.078
I thought I had a date.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.445
Takes video, too.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.808 --> 02:52.692
I got to hand it to you,
Charlie.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.923
Stopping at the copy place
was a great idea.

02:56.057 --> 02:58.414
And the picture
will make a terrific
Christmas card.

03:00.657 --> 03:02.429
JUDITH:
Want to get
the door, Herb?!

03:02.429 --> 03:04.072
HERB:
Stop yelling at me!

03:04.072 --> 03:05.506
I'm not yelling!

03:05.573 --> 03:06.860
This is yelling!

03:07.506 --> 03:09.040
You know what?
This really isn't that funny.

03:11.472 --> 03:12.739
Oh, hi, Alan,
Charlie.

03:12.806 --> 03:13.906
Herb.
Hey.

03:13.973 --> 03:15.072
This a bad time?

03:15.139 --> 03:17.172
The Spanish Inquisition
was a bad time.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.072
This is hell.

03:19.139 --> 03:20.131
Come in.

03:20.439 --> 03:21.848
So what's going on?

03:21.848 --> 03:23.667
A little pre-
wedding jitters?

03:23.839 --> 03:24.940
You could call it that,

03:24.940 --> 03:27.112
but we'd just
be sugar-coating hell.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.006
Oh, don't worry.

03:29.072 --> 03:30.806
As soon as Judith puts
on that beautiful
white gown

03:30.873 --> 03:31.975
and starts marching
down that aisle...

03:31.975 --> 03:33.606
She doesn't want
to wear white.

03:33.673 --> 03:34.850
Says it makes
her look fat.

03:35.172 --> 03:36.873
Oh, well, that's nice.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.339
She wants to look
trim and fit

03:38.406 --> 03:39.763
for the honeymoon.

03:39.763 --> 03:41.712
You're sugar-coating
hell again, Alan.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.477
If you really want
to help the guy,

03:43.477 --> 03:45.439
stop talking and smother him
with a pillow.

03:46.432 --> 03:47.860
Hey.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.201
Hey, there's the blushing bride.

03:50.406 --> 03:52.109
She doesn't look fat
at all.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.039
Go ahead.
Give her the check.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.245
What check?

03:57.233 --> 04:00.806
Oh, uh, well, I-I figured
as long as I was here,

04:01.229 --> 04:06.296
that I would give you your last
and final alimony check.

04:08.940 --> 04:09.948
Got it.

04:10.506 --> 04:12.139
What the hell are you doing?

04:12.205 --> 04:13.606
Just a little
souvenir.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.053
I'll go find Jake.

04:15.072 --> 04:16.873
See? She's being
a good sport.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.370
Let's get one
withhe big check.

04:18.372 --> 04:20.471
Forget the big check.

04:20.539 --> 04:24.606
So, um, you know, um,
I-I read an interesting
story the other day.

04:24.673 --> 04:27.006
Uh, married men
live, on average,

04:27.072 --> 04:29.006
ten years longer
than single men.

04:29.072 --> 04:30.906
What if they
don't want to?

04:31.469 --> 04:33.873
Come on, you and Judith
were made for each other.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.572
What could possibly
come between you?

04:35.573 --> 04:36.372
My sister.

04:36.439 --> 04:38.006
You got a sister?

04:38.072 --> 04:39.839
Down, Charlie.

04:39.906 --> 04:41.986
She came out a few days early
to help with the wedding,

04:41.986 --> 04:43.306
but it's not really helping.

04:43.372 --> 04:44.873
What does she look like?
Charlie!

04:44.940 --> 04:46.639
She doesn't have
a therapist, does she?

04:46.706 --> 04:47.706
Charlie, I swear to God!

04:47.773 --> 04:49.773
So what do you think?

04:49.839 --> 04:52.439
Should I wear it or have a vet
check it for worms?

04:52.506 --> 04:56.040
No, no, it looks fine.

04:56.105 --> 04:58.205
Oh, Myra, this is
Judith's first husband, Alan.

04:58.272 --> 05:00.205
Hi.
So how does this work?

05:00.272 --> 05:02.072
Do you get your
original testicles back

05:02.139 --> 05:04.172
or does my brother
give you his?

05:05.873 --> 05:08.539
Myra, the castration jokes
are getting a little old.

05:09.266 --> 05:10.339
Not in my house.

05:11.606 --> 05:13.506
Myra, this is Alan's brother,
Charlie.

05:13.573 --> 05:15.239
Oh, yeah, the booze-
riddled sleazebag.

05:16.372 --> 05:18.040
She did not hear that from me.

05:18.105 --> 05:20.472
It's not like it's a big secret.

05:20.539 --> 05:21.839
JUDITH:
Myra,

05:21.906 --> 05:23.306
where the hell is Jake?

05:23.372 --> 05:25.040
How should I know?

05:25.105 --> 05:27.040
Because I asked you
to get him ready to go
to his father's.

05:27.105 --> 05:31.105
You also asked me to try on
this satin stool sample.

05:31.172 --> 05:33.606
Herb, tell your sister
it's a lovely dress.

05:33.673 --> 05:35.372
Herb, tell your fiancÃ©e
the diet pills

05:35.439 --> 05:38.072
are affecting her judgment
but not her ass.

05:38.139 --> 05:39.873
That's it,
she's got to go.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.006
I can't throw
out family!

05:42.072 --> 05:44.706
And that's the
bitch of it, Herb.

05:47.272 --> 05:49.105
Hey, um, Charlie and I

05:49.172 --> 05:51.006
were thinking of taking
Jake out to a movie.

05:51.072 --> 05:52.739
We were?
We were.

05:52.806 --> 05:54.472
Myra, would you like
to join us?

05:54.539 --> 05:56.040
You didn't say anything
about a movie.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.706
I wanted to
surprise you.

05:58.773 --> 06:00.706
Hey, you know what?
That's a great idea.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.339
Go to a movie
with Alan and Charlie.

06:02.406 --> 06:04.940
Can I wear my pretty new dress?

06:05.006 --> 06:07.539
Get her out, Herb.

06:07.606 --> 06:11.040
Hey, look what I found
in the bushes.

06:21.927 --> 06:24.973
God, I hate
family movies.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.673
What, you don't buy
the central premise

06:26.739 --> 06:28.673
that a dog
can play hockey?

06:30.773 --> 06:33.539
Well, not as a
power forward.

06:36.973 --> 06:39.940
Oh. We're flying the
friendly skies, are we?

06:40.639 --> 06:42.139
After you.

06:42.205 --> 06:44.105
Why, thank you.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.739
So, you're staying
at Judith's.

06:49.806 --> 06:51.539
Yep.

06:51.606 --> 06:53.406
What does she
say about me?

06:53.472 --> 06:55.006
Well, if she's telling
the truth,

06:55.072 --> 06:57.973
we really shouldn't be drinking
out of the same cup.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.906
That might be
the nicest thing

06:59.973 --> 07:02.739
she's ever
said about me.

07:02.806 --> 07:06.006
I just don't understand
what my brother sees in her.

07:06.072 --> 07:11.506
You know, 15 years
ago I asked the exact
same question.

07:11.573 --> 07:12.806
A little tip?

07:12.873 --> 07:14.806
Don't do it during
the wedding toast.

07:16.506 --> 07:19.072
Maybe you can clear
something up for me.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.906
Herb says you're
a successful jingle writer,

07:21.973 --> 07:23.973
but Judith says you are
a drunken talentless hack

07:24.040 --> 07:26.139
who passed out and fell
into a pit of money.

07:28.128 --> 07:29.806
So what do you
need cleared up?

07:32.472 --> 07:35.372
Boy, you got me
at a disadvantage.

07:35.439 --> 07:37.172
I don't know why
Judith hates you.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.773
Hmm, it's hard to say.

07:39.839 --> 07:41.573
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm smart.

07:41.639 --> 07:43.839
Maybe it's because
I'm independent.

07:43.906 --> 07:46.205
Maybe it's because I offered my
brother a thousand dollars

07:46.272 --> 07:47.576
to call off the wedding.

07:48.653 --> 07:51.006
I did the same thing
with my brother.

07:51.105 --> 07:52.439
You did?

07:52.506 --> 07:56.006
Well, actually, it was a
thousand-dollar hooker...

07:58.521 --> 08:00.573
...but the thought
was the same.

08:05.940 --> 08:09.639
So, Myra...
what do you do?

08:09.706 --> 08:12.072
I teach high school
economics.

08:12.139 --> 08:13.873
Huh.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.406
It may sound
like a boring life,

08:15.472 --> 08:18.606
but at night, I dress up like
a giant spider and fight crime.

08:20.873 --> 08:23.573
Interesting. Now,
did you decide spider

08:23.639 --> 08:25.139
and have the costume made

08:25.205 --> 08:27.973
or did you find the costume
and say, "Okay, spider"?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.706
Are you mocking
the Scarlet Arachnid?

08:33.306 --> 08:35.072
Sorry, sorry.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.673
It's just hard to believe
that you're Herb's sister.

08:37.739 --> 08:39.673
He's so...

08:39.739 --> 08:41.172
Hapless?

08:42.211 --> 08:44.727
I was going to say "tall,"
but hapless works.

08:46.072 --> 08:49.072
To hapless Herb.

08:49.139 --> 08:51.072
To the Scarlet Arachnid.

08:52.070 --> 08:53.288
Shh.

08:53.372 --> 08:55.105
My enemies are everywhere.

08:57.839 --> 09:02.272
* Let's all go to the lobby,
let's all go the lobby *

09:02.339 --> 09:07.906
* Let's all go the lobby
and have ourselves a treat. *

09:08.817 --> 09:10.517
We're here.

09:10.773 --> 09:14.105
Oh, yes,
Judith's house of pain.

09:14.172 --> 09:16.306
Shh, shh, ixnay!

09:16.372 --> 09:17.372
That's her id-kay.

09:18.289 --> 09:20.177
We're... here.

09:20.973 --> 09:23.839
Well, thanks
for the movie.

09:23.906 --> 09:24.845
Wait. Wait, wait.

09:24.845 --> 09:27.473
I'll walk you.
Why, thank you.

09:28.973 --> 09:29.947
CHARLIE:
Whoa!

09:31.228 --> 09:32.256
MYRA:
You okay?

09:32.808 --> 09:35.114
CHARLIE:
I never know till I sober up.

09:37.108 --> 09:38.634
I think
they like each other.

09:38.634 --> 09:40.873
Well, sure they
like each other.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.292
<i>No, I mean, they like
like each other.</i>

09:43.292 --> 09:44.715
Oh, no, Jake.

09:44.715 --> 09:46.541
<i>Your Uncle Charlie
only like likes</i>

09:46.541 --> 09:48.271
a certain type of woman.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.052
Mom calls 'em tramps.

09:52.105 --> 09:53.950
That's as good
a word as any.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.978
Thanks, that was fun.

09:58.036 --> 09:59.935
Yeah, it was.

10:00.239 --> 10:01.093
See ya around.

10:01.573 --> 10:02.457
Yeah.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.039
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.004
Who cares?

10:12.139 --> 10:14.472
Looks like Aunt Myra's
a tramp, huh?

10:20.046 --> 10:22.180
me on, Judith,
so he gave her a kiss.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.518
It's no big deal.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.113
That's how Charlie says
good-bye.

10:25.864 --> 10:28.046
Some people shake hands,
some people wave,

10:28.113 --> 10:30.554
my brother darts his tongue
in and out of your mouth.

10:31.919 --> 10:33.279
What'd I miss?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.797
You know Dr. Melnick?

10:34.797 --> 10:36.180
Guy your mom's
marrying?

10:36.592 --> 10:38.238
He has a sister...
Got it.

10:39.846 --> 10:42.479
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with you, Judith.

10:42.881 --> 10:44.146
Wait, hang on a second.

10:44.213 --> 10:45.646
Jake, are you done
with your breakfast?

10:45.712 --> 10:47.346
Yeah.
Then get out.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.679
Fine, Berta will just tell me
later, right?

10:49.746 --> 10:50.746
Right.

10:54.413 --> 10:55.879
Okay, Judith, that's insane.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.679
Charlie would not do Myra
just to piss you off.

10:58.746 --> 11:00.913
I don't think.

11:00.979 --> 11:02.779
How would I know
what he sees in her?

11:02.846 --> 11:04.646
She got working girl parts?

11:06.646 --> 11:07.579
You know what?

11:07.646 --> 11:09.480
You leave. Send Jake back.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.380
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

11:12.447 --> 11:13.913
I'll talk to him.

11:13.979 --> 11:15.813
I, I don't know.

11:15.879 --> 11:18.579
I'll, uh, I'll tell him
to keep his hands off Myra.

11:18.646 --> 11:20.712
And then I'll tell
the rain not to fall,

11:20.779 --> 11:23.612
the Earth not to spin
and you to stop nagging me!

11:30.846 --> 11:33.346
Oh, boy, I'm going
to pay for that.

11:33.841 --> 11:35.413
You know what your problem is?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.746
Phone cojones.

11:37.461 --> 11:38.113
Excuse me?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.547
When you're
on the phone with her,

11:39.612 --> 11:41.480
you got boulders
between your legs.

11:43.013 --> 11:46.547
The minute you hang up,
you're as smooth as a Ken doll.

11:47.746 --> 11:49.979
Phone cojones.

11:50.046 --> 11:51.447
Good to have a name for it.

11:52.314 --> 11:54.013
So, tell me about the sister.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.280
I don't know.

11:55.346 --> 11:56.640
She doesn't seem
like his type at all.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.579
What, no coin slot
in her forehead?

11:59.646 --> 12:01.447
Morning.
Morning.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.380
Charlie, we need
to talk about Myra.

12:04.132 --> 12:05.991
Yeah, that was
probably a mistake.

12:05.991 --> 12:06.733
It was?

12:07.186 --> 12:08.879
She's a nice kid, but...

12:08.946 --> 12:10.313
she's just not,
you know...

12:10.380 --> 12:13.113
A red-hot simpleton
with no self-respect?

12:15.046 --> 12:16.579
I just hope she
didn't take

12:16.646 --> 12:17.946
that whole kiss
thing too seriously.

12:18.013 --> 12:19.979
So, you're not planning
on pursuing her?

12:20.046 --> 12:21.712
No, no, no.

12:21.779 --> 12:23.413
In fact, I got
a date tonight

12:23.480 --> 12:26.413
with a lovely sex
addict whose therapist
is on vacation.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.213
It's what we
eligible bachelors

12:29.280 --> 12:31.547
call "a window
of opportunity."

12:33.080 --> 12:35.013
You know, Charlie, there's
a special section in hell

12:35.080 --> 12:36.612
reserved for people like you.

12:37.878 --> 12:38.513
That's good,

12:38.579 --> 12:40.500
'cause I'd hate
to have to stand on line.

12:42.046 --> 12:44.646
So I'm like, "Yeah,
I can make a lot of money

12:44.712 --> 12:46.180
"as a lingerie model,
but then who's

12:46.246 --> 12:48.946
gonna take me seriously
as a director?"

12:49.881 --> 12:50.812
Good point.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.180
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't beautiful.

12:53.246 --> 12:55.513
I mean, ugly people
have it so easy, you know?

12:56.372 --> 12:57.266
I've heard.

12:57.579 --> 13:00.413
So, what about you?
Still writing jingles?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.046
Just during the day.

13:02.113 --> 13:05.080
At night, I dress up as a
big spider and fight crime.

13:05.146 --> 13:07.413
Huh. You know,
I dated a cop once.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.979
Well, it wasn't
so much a date

13:09.046 --> 13:11.513
as a way to get
out of a ticket.

13:11.867 --> 13:12.745
Interesting.

13:12.979 --> 13:15.346
Okay. Here we are.

13:15.413 --> 13:17.879
Ah. I hope this place
has fresh lobster.

13:17.946 --> 13:20.513
That frozen stuff
is just disgusting.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.712
JUDITH:
You know what, Herb?

13:37.779 --> 13:39.346
Forget it.
I'll do it myself.

13:39.413 --> 13:41.447
HERB:
I said I would do it--
I'll do it!

13:41.513 --> 13:43.346
MYRA:
For God's sake,
Judith, get off his back!

13:43.413 --> 13:45.146
JUDITH:
No one's talking to you, Myra!

13:45.213 --> 13:46.979
HERB:
Okay, everyone calm down.

13:47.046 --> 13:48.413
I'm doing it.

13:49.513 --> 13:50.679
Oh. Hi, Charlie.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.913
Hey, Herb.

13:51.979 --> 13:54.946
Just taking out the trash.

13:55.013 --> 13:57.746
Yeah, I'm coming from
doing the same thing.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.447
Great. He leaves
the door wide op...

14:01.513 --> 14:02.946
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:03.013 --> 14:04.513
That's a good question.

14:04.579 --> 14:05.513
See, the thing is I...

14:05.579 --> 14:06.846
Oh, hey, Charlie.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.146
Hi, Myra.

14:09.213 --> 14:10.547
No. No.
I forbid it.

14:10.612 --> 14:12.013
Not in my house.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.612
What brings you
to the cul-de-sac of the damned?

14:16.225 --> 14:17.612
Just in the neighborhood.

14:17.679 --> 14:18.813
That's nice.

14:18.879 --> 14:19.846
Come on in.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.088
Thanks.

14:23.046 --> 14:25.979
I said no! Doesn't anybody
listen to me?!

14:26.046 --> 14:27.413
I'm doing
it! Look!

14:30.779 --> 14:34.313
You know, I really didn't
expect to see you again.

14:34.812 --> 14:36.579
Well, I wasn't
doing anything, so...

14:36.646 --> 14:37.846
MYRA:
No, Alan, listen to me.

14:37.913 --> 14:40.213
He's here right now!

14:40.280 --> 14:42.313
Why would I kid
about that?

14:42.380 --> 14:45.146
I don't know, maybe his
other date didn't work out.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.879
Ah, the plot thickens.

14:51.946 --> 14:54.280
Okay, okay, I can explain.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.746
No, I can't.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.712
Give it a shot.

15:00.398 --> 15:02.436
Well, um...

15:02.447 --> 15:05.612
I was with this girl,
and I suddenly realized

15:05.679 --> 15:08.146
that I'd rather be with
someone who I, you know,

15:08.213 --> 15:10.180
actually enjoy being with.

15:10.575 --> 15:12.547
Oh just forget it, Alan;
you're useless.

15:13.088 --> 15:14.781
Herb, do something!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.246
Hey.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.080
I'm thinking about
going out for ice cream.

15:20.146 --> 15:21.779
Anyone want
to join me?

15:21.846 --> 15:25.746
Charlie, when's the last time
you had a cone with sprinkles?

15:26.655 --> 15:28.113
You know what, Herb?
Judith can relax.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.499
I'm gonna check into a hotel.

15:29.603 --> 15:30.367
Myra, no.

15:30.367 --> 15:31.762
You don't have to do that.

15:31.837 --> 15:33.064
Yes, she does.

15:33.985 --> 15:35.183
Hey, she's my sister!

15:35.184 --> 15:36.818
She can stay as
long as she wants!

15:37.694 --> 15:39.048
I really appreciate this.

15:39.048 --> 15:40.891
I'll go get my stuff.

15:40.891 --> 15:42.224
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:42.251 --> 15:43.518
You don't have
to stay at a hotel.

15:43.584 --> 15:44.951
I got plenty of
room at my place.

15:44.951 --> 15:46.217
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

15:46.284 --> 15:47.851
N-N-No, no, no, no.

15:47.918 --> 15:49.317
No strings attached.

15:49.833 --> 15:50.518
Really?

15:50.534 --> 15:51.278
Really.

15:53.074 --> 15:54.951
Still, I couldn't
impose like that.

15:55.018 --> 15:56.085
It's no imposition.

15:56.152 --> 15:57.251
It's a big house.

15:57.317 --> 15:58.617
There's plenty of room
for everybody.

15:58.618 --> 15:59.914
You sure?

15:59.914 --> 16:01.205
Absolutely.

16:01.317 --> 16:02.832
Okay, then.

16:02.842 --> 16:03.851
I'll be right back.

16:04.602 --> 16:05.844
JUDITH:
Herb!

16:07.551 --> 16:08.885
You want to come, too?

16:12.251 --> 16:13.718
Are you nuts?

16:13.785 --> 16:16.152
With Myra out of the house,
I might get lucky tonight.

16:17.666 --> 16:18.311
Really?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.617
She seems pretty angry.

16:19.618 --> 16:21.651
It's better when she's angry.

16:23.251 --> 16:25.418
Coming, pookie!

16:33.484 --> 16:35.217
This just sucks.

16:35.974 --> 16:38.284
It's just for a couple of
days till the wedding.

16:38.351 --> 16:40.618
<i>Yeah, but why does she
have to stay in my room?</i>

16:40.685 --> 16:42.384
Because... I don't know.

16:42.451 --> 16:44.085
You're the kid.

16:44.152 --> 16:46.018
Yeah, well, it's not fair.

16:46.085 --> 16:47.818
Yeah, well, get over it.

16:51.152 --> 16:53.317
Oh, my God!

16:53.384 --> 16:54.718
Jake, that's disgusting.

16:54.785 --> 16:56.685
Yeah, well, get over it.

16:59.317 --> 17:00.718
Go to sleep.

17:04.751 --> 17:06.351
Did you brush
your teeth?

17:06.869 --> 17:09.018
Dad, I'm asleep.

17:09.285 --> 17:10.917
Go brush your teeth.

17:10.984 --> 17:12.851
I can't; I don't have
my toothbrush.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.152
Well, go get it.

17:14.748 --> 17:15.451
Man!

17:15.518 --> 17:18.217
I have to do everything
around here.

17:28.018 --> 17:29.484
Aunt Myra?

17:29.551 --> 17:31.751
I have to get my toothbrush.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.618
Aunt Myra?

17:44.085 --> 17:45.851
Aunt Myra?

17:50.018 --> 17:52.384
Huh.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.570
Oh.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.418
Huh.

18:00.785 --> 18:01.718
Hi.

18:01.785 --> 18:03.284
Hi.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.052
Is everything okay?

18:06.118 --> 18:07.418
Everything's fine.

18:07.484 --> 18:09.184
I just wanted to chat.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.851
Oh. Okay.

18:11.918 --> 18:14.085
I can go if you want.
No, no. No.

18:14.152 --> 18:15.384
No, this is fine.

18:15.451 --> 18:16.785
So...

18:17.843 --> 18:18.775
What's up?

18:18.775 --> 18:21.384
Well, we never really talked
about that kiss last night.

18:21.451 --> 18:23.317
Right, right.

18:24.051 --> 18:25.418
That was a little
out of character for me.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.718
Really? That's not
the word on the street.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.785
Okay, let me explain. Um...

18:32.851 --> 18:35.785
With me, kissing is usually
just a prelude to sex,

18:35.851 --> 18:38.818
but last night, sex was
the last thing on my mind.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.818
Oh, gee, what girl doesn't
like to hear that?

18:42.290 --> 18:44.253
No, no. No, wait, let me finish.

18:46.118 --> 18:48.751
I kissed you
because I really liked you,

18:48.818 --> 18:53.251
and I wanted to express
my... liking of you.

18:53.317 --> 18:55.052
Be still, my
beating heart.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.052
Oh, come on, Myra.

18:57.118 --> 18:59.384
I drove all the way
to Judith's house to see you.

18:59.451 --> 19:00.951
And you know what's at Judith's
house?

19:01.018 --> 19:02.261
Judith!

19:03.368 --> 19:05.235
That was very
brave of you.

19:05.302 --> 19:07.035
Oh, no, it wasn't
brave, it was...

19:09.035 --> 19:11.302
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what it was,

19:11.368 --> 19:14.235
and I'm not really sure
what to do here.

19:14.302 --> 19:16.201
What do you
want to do here?

19:17.163 --> 19:19.207
Let's forget about me
for a second.

19:19.207 --> 19:19.995
??????????

19:20.201 --> 19:21.021
What about me?

19:21.235 --> 19:23.001
You kissed first.

19:23.068 --> 19:24.068
Why'd you do that?

19:24.135 --> 19:25.524
Oh, I was plowed.

19:27.353 --> 19:27.996
Really?

19:28.556 --> 19:30.001
Oh, come on, you moron.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.701
I'm sitting in the
middle of your bed

19:31.768 --> 19:33.622
in my sexiest lingerie.

19:35.434 --> 19:37.068
All right.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.402
I'm pretty sure
I know what to do now.

19:42.801 --> 19:44.134
Charlie?

19:44.135 --> 19:44.958
Yeah?

19:45.634 --> 19:48.501
I don't want to put any
pressure on you, but...

19:49.256 --> 19:50.653
I'm a virgin.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.415
You are?

19:56.132 --> 19:59.302
Man, you got to stop
sleeping with dumb girls.

19:59.368 --> 20:00.709
It's rubbing off on you.

20:03.395 --> 20:05.062
bed?

20:05.129 --> 20:06.678
Aunt Myra's not there.

20:06.795 --> 20:07.967
I'm sure she will be.

20:08.395 --> 20:10.084
She's probably just getting
something in the kitchen.

20:18.601 --> 20:20.674
That's not the kitchen.
