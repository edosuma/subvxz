01:18.360 --> 01:19.919
Should be enough to get me up north.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.389
-The Wasteland?
-That's where I'll find Ankara.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.835
NIX: Who's Ankara?

01:24.920 --> 01:28.515
SUNNY: A witch. If anyone will know
how to stop Pilgrim, it's her.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.273
Let's get you out of here.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.478
| should've known you'd lead me to him.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.393
Let him go, M.K.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.120
I'm gonna let Pilgrim
deal with you later.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.952
For now, get out of my way.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.432
He's right. This isn't your fight.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.871
| don't want to hurt you.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.955
You can't.

Can he go dark again?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.314
Not for a while.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.199
You should kill me while you can.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.352
Pilgrim will find you and I'll be there.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.238
You know you can't go back now.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.913
Did you manipulate what I saw
in the mirror chamber?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.395
-It was your vision.
-Don't play games with me.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.557
You think I turned on you,

04:38.640 --> 04:40.278
is that it?

04:40.360 --> 04:43.273
Just like Bajie and the girl,

04:43.360 --> 04:45.237
Tilda.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.550
Always looking for enemies.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.433
When the real enemy is
the darkness within you.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.077
The darkness that would consume you
if you were ever to get your Gift back.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.834
The vision you just survived proves that.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.915
Does this mean that I can
never get my Gift back?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.833
Is that the only reason
you would fight Pilgrim?

Not merely your own.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.556
So, what now?

05:25.640 --> 05:29.395
Now, you are ready to begin.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.720
We've been walking for hours.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.710
You need to rest your leg.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.916
Here, drink.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.194
I'm fine.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.599
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

06:09.840 --> 06:12.992
Pilgrim, I'm sorry
for what he did to you.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.680
It's not your fault.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.637
Yes, it is.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.672
Castor tried to warn me.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.914
It hurts, doesn't it?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.229
Waking up.

06:30.600 --> 06:35.310
| used to kill for my Baron,
same as you did for Pilgrim.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.995
It was so easy letting someone else
choose my life for me.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.151
| remember.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.880
At least now we get to choose
how to set things right.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.952
Nix no longer matters.
You have other Dear Ones now.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.713
Half of whom we have already lost.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.191
Have faith.
The Chamber will soon be restored.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.113
Faith is for mortals.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.477
A god has only himself to believe in.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.200
All this power inside me.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.477
| can feel it,
coursing through my blood like fire.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.631
Begging to be unleashed,

07:10.720 --> 07:13.394
to conquer this world
in the name of Azra.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.471
But what good is a conqueror
without an army?

07:17.560 --> 07:19.597
-Leave us.
-No, stay.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.074
Your failure allowed Sanzo to escape.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.719
| told you it was Nix.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.239
How do I know you didn't help her?

07:27.320 --> 07:30.073
How do I know you're not
the next to betray me?

07:31.040 --> 07:34.396
Because you need a dark-eyed army,
and I know where to find you one.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.710
The Monastery is here,
hidden in the mountains.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.440
They capture people with The Gift
and bring them there for training.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.477
But if anyone defies them
or tries to escape,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.995
The Master uses these needles
to put them to sleep.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.354
Sleep?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.432
It's more like a coma.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.953
You've known of this place.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.469
Why are you only telling us now?

08:01.560 --> 08:04.359
Because I was afraid of going back.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.512
The Master is the most powerful
person I've ever seen.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.239
Until me.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.674
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Hello, boys.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.717
| need to have a quick word
with The Master.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.997
You think she could...
You think she could squeeze me in?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.720
(EXCLAIMS) You're pinching me.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.475
All right.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.839
Hello.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.116
You look good.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.271
Lost a bit of weight?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.355
Thanks, ladies.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.511
It was only a matter of time before
you showed up, begging for forgiveness.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.114
| have never begged for
anything in my life.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.155
But on occasion, I do grovel. So...

09:21.240 --> 09:22.878
So at the end, I'd like to say,

09:22.960 --> 09:27.670
I'm sorry for jeopardizing
the entire world. All right?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.400
In my defense,
| only took Sunny to see Ankara

09:30.480 --> 09:32.357
"cause I thought she could
help his dying son.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.272
| didn't realize he'd be some
kind of catalyst.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.351
Catalyst?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.114
But it turns out Sunny and Pilgrim
are long lost brothers of Azra.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.235
Ankara used to tell stories about
lost children of Azra.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.117
| thought these were the ravings
of a mad woman.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.558
Yeah, well, it turns out those ravings
were completely true.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.473
The fault is mine.
| should have needled her,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.473
not forced her into exile.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.870
(SCOFFS) That's your answer
to everything, isn't it?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.873
Hey, neither of us
can change what you did

10:03.960 --> 10:06.076
but I'm here because I want to fix it.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.713
-You're gonna help me or not?
-No.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.030
You are going to help us.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.433
Oh, shit.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.595
Bajie?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.836
(MUTTERS) Flea.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.354
(WIND BLOWING)

10:30.360 --> 10:33.193
How can you be sure Ankara
will know how to stop Pilgrim?

10:33.280 --> 10:36.591
She's the one who set this all in motion.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.036
Sent me to Pilgrim to start the Chamber.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.350
She's the only chance we have.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.713
What sort of person
lives out here all alone?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.672
A dangerous one.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.598
Black Lotus.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.634
More are on the way. We must hurry.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.631
You're not going anywhere.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.030
Until you tell me how to stop Pilgrim.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.509
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
You wanted to heal your son.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.160
| told you there would be a price to pay.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.719
-(FLESH SQUELCHES)
-(WHIMPERS)

11:36.840 --> 11:41.596
If you won't help me, there's no reason
why I shouldn't leave you here to die.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.236
(SHUDDERING)
Get me to Black Wind alive

11:45.320 --> 11:47.152
and I'll tell you what you need to know.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.071
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

11:56.960 --> 11:58.598
Her Clippers aren't quitting.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.149
What's more,
they're coordinating their attacks.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.793
What does that tell us?

12:02.880 --> 12:04.473
Chau's alive and she's
directing them from hiding.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.076
What?

12:11.160 --> 12:13.959
I'm thinking we should
kill two birds with one stone.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.069
One of them literally.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.118
The one person who will know
about The Widow is Chau.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.555
Find her and we can get some answers.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.870
-And then?
-We'll bring back her head.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.715
Once we parade that around, it'll take
the fight out of her Lieutenants.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.110
So, how do we find Chau?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.316
| know someone who can point us
in the right direction.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.110
All those years in prison,
my mother never visited.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.630
Well, maybe it's time I visited her.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.194
All the Harbingers will be ready to
depart for the Monastery by nightfall.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.679
Excellent.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.036
We're gonna leave
the Fortress undefended?

12:58.120 --> 13:00.680
The Barons are too busy fighting
each other to be any threat.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.154
Don't underestimate The Widow.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.709
If the rumors from
the battlefield are true,

13:04.800 --> 13:06.791
she may already be dead.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.918
The boy is right.
We can't leave our home unprotected.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.355
Then you should stay, watch the flock.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.470
Give me two Harbingers,

13:28.560 --> 13:31.712
| will make certain no one defies you.

13:34.720 --> 13:40.352
It's time to put the fear of the gods
into the Badlands.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.039
NIX: We're not going to get
very far like this.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.714
SUNNY: Those Black Lotus
didn't get here on foot.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.279
There's their truck. Let's go.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.113
Master. Hey, we don't have time for this

13:59.200 --> 14:01.589
and I definitely don't have time for her.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.637
We should be taking the Abbots
and we should be marching

14:03.720 --> 14:05.597
on Pilgrim's Fortress now.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.353
Pilgrim will just shut them down.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.477
-I've seen him do it with my eyes.
-All right.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.437
So, you knew he was a threat
and you've done nothing to stop him?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.193
MINERVA:
I'm not the one who sent the signal.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.920
Typical Bajie, always blaming
everyone else for your mistakes

14:16.040 --> 14:17.553
No, no. You don't get to judge me.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.278
You're no better than Pilgrim.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.033
I'm fighting for a just cause.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.873
Really? Is that what you tell Veil,
when you pinched her out to Quinn.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.076
THE MASTER: Enough. Both of you.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.594
Follow me.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.437
-Go on.
-Yeah, fine.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.033
(SIGHS)

14:42.960 --> 14:45.031
What are these for?
The chopstick challenge?

14:45.120 --> 14:46.838
THE MASTER:
You were once a great team.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.038
So much so that Bajie
sacrificed his Gift for you.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.509
Oh, really? He never mentions it.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.432
THE MASTER:
And I've not forgotten, Bajie,

14:54.520 --> 14:57.512
that you told me Minerva was the best
novice you ever trained.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.594
| don't know if I used those exact words.
But yeah, pretty good.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.638
Seems the two of you
have a lot to work out.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.314
MINERVA: This is ridiculous.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.358
I'm not going to fight him.
Where are you going?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.760
(LAUGHS)

15:11.840 --> 15:14.958
As if she's going to tell you.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.077
Don't you ever shut up?

15:17.160 --> 15:18.798
Why don't you make me?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.230
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:57.840 --> 16:00.195
Maybe you're not the best
novice I ever taught, huh?

16:00.280 --> 16:01.509
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:09.880 --> 16:10.711
Huh?

16:14.120 --> 16:15.235
(GROANS)

16:20.040 --> 16:22.475
(CHUCKLES) I did not expect that.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.789
Huh.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.992
NIX: Sunny, she's waking up.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.033
SUNNY: What's in Black Wind?
Some kind of healer?

16:43.240 --> 16:45.914
We're not going anywhere
until you tell me what's in Black Wind.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.957
A healer won't do any good

16:48.040 --> 16:49.838
once the Black Lotus
have marked you for death.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.311
My only hope is to find a ship
and get out of the Badlands for good.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.792
-They've come after me, too.
-Then you're as damned as me.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.558
The Black Lotus are an ancient cult.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.199
A secret order whose sole mission

17:03.280 --> 17:05.839
is to eradicate the Dark Gift
from the face of the world.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.829
Pilgrim says they're the ones
who destroyed Azra.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.232
(EXHALES) They see The Gift
as a perversion of the natural order.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.472
They train in special techniques
to hunt and kill Dark Ones.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.837
They won't stop until
every one of us is dead.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.638
That includes you, Sanzo.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.874
No...

17:31.960 --> 17:34.110
-What is it?
-(SHUDDERING BREATHS)

17:37.760 --> 17:40.912
| can feel her eyes. Searching for me.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.912
(BIRD SCREECHING)

(CONTINUES WHIMPERING)

18:21.200 --> 18:22.599
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
She found me.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.999
-She's with the Catalyst.
-Sunny's alive?

18:32.080 --> 18:34.276
