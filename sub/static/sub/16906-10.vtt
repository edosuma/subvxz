WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:05.498
Really, Bev? Thank you so much.
That is wonderful news.

00:06.194 --> 00:07.194
"Wonderful news"?

00:07.195 --> 00:10.331
The last time I said that
was when my pet gnus

00:10.365 --> 00:11.966
learned the true meaning of Christmas.

00:12.001 --> 00:14.302
Classic Tracy...
You'll miss this.

00:14.336 --> 00:16.671
Anyway, that was one
of the adoption agencies

00:16.705 --> 00:17.922
we're working with,

00:17.957 --> 00:19.641
and they may have a kid
who's perfect for us.

00:19.675 --> 00:21.876
He's a three-year-old boy
from Transylvania.

00:21.894 --> 00:23.761
Stay with me.
His name is Dracul.

00:23.812 --> 00:24.979
Hear me out.

00:25.014 --> 00:27.649
He is a hemophiliac
with a sleep disorder.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.350
Children change everything.

00:29.384 --> 00:31.019
Right now you can do what you want,

00:31.053 --> 00:32.103
but once you have kids,

00:32.154 --> 00:33.855
you have to be on their schedule,

00:33.889 --> 00:35.106
watch their cartoons,

00:35.157 --> 00:36.441
and touch their poop.

00:36.492 --> 00:38.660
Tracy, you still do whatever you want.

00:38.694 --> 00:40.828
That's right, I do.

00:40.863 --> 00:42.163
But you don't.

00:42.197 --> 00:43.665
So have fun while you can.

00:43.699 --> 00:46.367
Be spontaneous.
You know, stop being yourself.

00:46.401 --> 00:47.535
I'm spontaneous.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.537
For instance, I started talking

00:49.571 --> 00:53.240
before I had an example
of how I'm spontaneous.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.084
Nice haul, Mr. CEO.
Did you get my gift?

01:04.102 --> 01:06.253
I assume it was the bottle of wine

01:06.271 --> 01:08.189
with the card, reading, "dear doritos,

01:08.223 --> 01:10.858
"what about just selling bags
full of your dust?

01:10.893 --> 01:12.593
I could put it
on chicken or fish."

01:12.611 --> 01:14.112
Obviously,
there was a mix-up.

01:14.146 --> 01:16.064
I wrote you a very heartfelt note

01:16.098 --> 01:18.449
that said, "congratulations
on becoming CEO.

01:18.484 --> 01:20.868
Do you know anyone
at Doritos?"

01:20.903 --> 01:22.487
Well, I'm not CEO yet.

01:22.538 --> 01:23.955
The board has
to rubber-stamp me.

01:23.989 --> 01:25.669
There'll be a party for me
later this week.

01:25.708 --> 01:27.492
Then I have to drive around
with my headlights off

01:27.543 --> 01:28.743
until someone flashes me.

01:28.777 --> 01:30.378
Then I have to...
Well, it's not important.

01:30.412 --> 01:32.997
In the meantime,
I'm tying up some loose ends.

01:33.048 --> 01:34.749
I'm heading down to Florida
this afternoon

01:34.783 --> 01:36.384
to take care of my mother's estate.

01:36.418 --> 01:39.337
Fittingly, she left everything
to her live-in nurse, Martha...

01:39.388 --> 01:41.756
The house I paid for, the silver,

01:41.790 --> 01:43.758
my grandfather's purple heart.

01:43.792 --> 01:46.094
It's terrible what alcoholism
can do to the body.

01:46.128 --> 01:47.595
She really didn't leave you anything?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.430
That's not very nice.
I loved my mother, Lemon...

01:49.464 --> 01:51.516
Obviously, because
of Stockholm syndrome.

01:51.567 --> 01:54.986
But she was, on her best day,
a miserable old crone

01:55.020 --> 01:57.605
whose only joy came
in sharing her unhappiness

01:57.639 --> 01:59.841
with others, even in death.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.776
She is the only person in the world

02:01.810 --> 02:03.411
to have sarcastic last words.

02:03.445 --> 02:05.213
"I just want you
to be 'happy'."

02:05.247 --> 02:06.948
Mother, how I "miss" you.

02:06.982 --> 02:09.650
Anyway, I thought you might like
to come to Florida with me.

02:09.668 --> 02:11.085
I can get you a V.I.P. pass

02:11.120 --> 02:12.537
to Universal's Harry Potter world.

02:12.588 --> 02:15.923
Okay, I am not some kind
of "nerdery" slut.

02:15.958 --> 02:17.125
I like <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:17.159 --> 02:18.926
Lemon, I'm not relishing this trip.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.795
It would be nice
to have someone with me.

02:20.829 --> 02:23.881
- Are you coming or not?
- Yes. I am.

02:23.932 --> 02:27.268
How's that for spontaneous...
Florida on a work day?

02:27.302 --> 02:28.335
To that store

02:28.353 --> 02:32.506
that sells long-sleeve
S.P.F. shirts!

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074

02:45.378 --> 02:47.615
30 ROCK
S07 Ep10 - Florida

02:48.065 --> 02:51.038
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:51.110 --> 02:53.411
Hey, I need somebody
to sign for this water.

02:53.462 --> 02:56.330
No, you need a nobody
to sign for that water.

02:56.364 --> 02:57.915
We're on TV.

02:57.966 --> 02:59.500
Okay, then who's in charge?

02:59.534 --> 03:01.035
Well, Liz, but she's in Florida.

03:01.053 --> 03:03.754
Or Pete, but he went
to a line producers' convention

03:03.806 --> 03:05.139
in Albany.

03:05.174 --> 03:06.507
I saw him pack a wig.

03:06.541 --> 03:10.144
Tracy, does this mean we're in charge?

03:17.552 --> 03:18.853
Where do you want the water?

03:43.545 --> 03:45.963
I'm sorry.
Where is Liz Lemon?

03:46.014 --> 03:47.215
She's out of the office.

03:47.249 --> 03:49.100
Is there anything
we could help you with?

03:49.134 --> 03:50.801
We've got about...
Ten minutes

03:50.853 --> 03:52.920
before we've got to go watch shopping.

03:52.938 --> 03:54.539
Well, this does affect the two of you.

03:54.573 --> 03:57.808
I'm Martin Lutherking
from NBC's in-house counsel.

03:57.860 --> 04:01.479
A former <i>TGS</i> employee
has filed a harassment lawsuit

04:01.530 --> 04:04.699
against this production
and both of you individually.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.433
Complainant is seeking damages
in the amount

04:06.451 --> 04:09.436
of $50 million.

04:10.455 --> 04:12.740
Hold my calls, giant bee.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.825
I assume you know this woman.

04:14.877 --> 04:18.161
- Wassername!
- What's her name?

04:18.213 --> 04:21.048
So these are the things
your mother wanted you to have.

04:22.634 --> 04:26.053
The baby shoe she found
after that fire.

04:26.088 --> 04:28.055
God, she loved looting.

04:28.090 --> 04:29.924
Colleen was such a lovely woman.

04:29.958 --> 04:32.426
Thank you, Martha,
but you don't have to do that.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.228
I mean, you knew Colleen.

04:34.263 --> 04:36.130
And there's so much I miss...

04:36.148 --> 04:37.732
Her kindness, her laugh.

04:37.766 --> 04:40.134
Her laugh, of course.

04:40.152 --> 04:42.103
She was the happiest person I ever met.

04:42.137 --> 04:43.187
Sure.

04:43.238 --> 04:45.690
Remind me of some of the happy things

04:45.741 --> 04:46.908
my mother would do.

04:46.942 --> 04:49.527
You know, tell jokes...

04:49.578 --> 04:51.529
And the pranks!

04:51.580 --> 04:55.116
Her nickname here
was Mrs. Silly.

04:55.150 --> 04:57.285
Tell me, Martha,

04:57.319 --> 04:59.870
how long did you work
for my mother exactly?

04:59.922 --> 05:03.090
I'm sorry.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.625
What the hell was that?

05:04.659 --> 05:06.794
She'll miss Colleen's laughter?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.963
That woman clearly didn't even
know my mother.

05:08.997 --> 05:10.497
This is a scam.

05:10.515 --> 05:12.183
She took advantage of an old lady.

05:12.217 --> 05:13.634
I saw this on <i>Dateline.</i>

05:13.668 --> 05:16.637
Next, we'll be holding hands
in adjacent bathtubs.

05:16.671 --> 05:19.106
Or maybe that was a Cialis
commercial... it's all a blur.

05:19.141 --> 05:22.143
I'm calling the police.

05:25.364 --> 05:27.898
<i>Thank you for calling
Florida emergency services.</i>

05:27.950 --> 05:29.817
<i>If this is regarding
an anaconda in a crawl space,</i>

05:29.851 --> 05:31.068
<i>press 1.</i>

05:31.119 --> 05:32.870
<i>If a sinkhole full
of Indian bones has appeared</i>

05:32.904 --> 05:34.405
<i>in your living room, press 2.</i>

05:34.456 --> 05:36.374
<i>If you want to know
why JAG wasn't on this week,</i>

05:36.408 --> 05:37.591
<i>press 3.</i>

05:37.626 --> 05:39.210
<i>If your shabbos goy...</i>

05:39.244 --> 05:41.412
Why can't we just cut this state adrift

05:41.463 --> 05:42.913
and let it crash into Cuba?

05:42.965 --> 05:44.415
We'll just solve this
ourselves, like that woman

05:44.466 --> 05:45.716
on <i>Dateline</i> who tried to solve
her sister's murder,

05:45.751 --> 05:47.168
then disappeared.

05:47.202 --> 05:49.337
But <i>we</i> won't go scuba-diving
with the husband.

05:49.371 --> 05:50.871
Lemon, when Martha comes back,

05:50.889 --> 05:52.873
I'll distract her
while you sneak around

05:52.891 --> 05:54.225
and go through her things.

05:54.259 --> 05:57.845
It's a caper!
Who's spontaneous now, Tracy?

05:57.879 --> 05:59.597
Okay, start from the beginning.

05:59.631 --> 06:01.565
Well, the plaintiff's
deposition alleges that...

06:01.600 --> 06:02.900
No, further back.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.102
What kind of dinosaur
was your grandfather?

06:05.153 --> 06:07.188
The plaintiff alleges that there is

06:07.222 --> 06:10.358
a widespread culture
of depravity here at <i>TGS...</i>

06:10.392 --> 06:13.995
Sexual harassment, intimidation,
threats of violence.

06:14.029 --> 06:17.498
Her deposition is very gross.

06:17.532 --> 06:19.566
I'm going to use this doll to show you

06:19.584 --> 06:21.702
what Tracy and Jenna did to me.

06:21.736 --> 06:22.753
No, no, no!

06:22.788 --> 06:23.838
Yes.

06:30.012 --> 06:31.929
She's lying like a rug.

06:31.963 --> 06:35.182
"Rug" is an offensive term
for Persians that I made up.

06:35.217 --> 06:37.018
We would never do that to a page...

06:37.052 --> 06:38.769
Maybe that tall Asian one.

06:38.804 --> 06:40.304
Yeah, Miranda.

06:40.355 --> 06:42.589
Her hair is so thick and black.

06:42.607 --> 06:43.891
Please don't include me in this.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.560
Look, legal views this
as a frivolous lawsuit.

06:46.594 --> 06:49.280
Hazel Wassername, aka Richard Drench,

06:49.314 --> 06:52.066
has a long history
of suing former employers.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.902
So all we need is for everyone
who works at <i>TGS</i>

06:54.936 --> 06:56.737
to sign this affidavit

06:56.771 --> 06:58.622
saying that they have never witnessed

06:58.657 --> 07:01.409
or been party
to any inappropriate behavior.

07:01.443 --> 07:02.877
I once played a lawyer in a movie,

07:02.911 --> 07:04.611
so I know all about winning
your son's love back

07:04.629 --> 07:06.380
thanks to a magic camera.

07:06.415 --> 07:08.366
Yes, movies are terrible.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.001
Well, don't worry.
We'll get everyone to sign.

07:11.053 --> 07:12.837
We really don't want this
to go to court

07:12.888 --> 07:14.138
for a number of reasons.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.924
You two could be personally
liable for any damages.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.077
Hank Hooper hates any type
of negative publicity like this.

07:20.112 --> 07:22.146
And I didn't super-duper finish
law school.

07:22.180 --> 07:25.182
So...

07:27.402 --> 07:28.819
I'm sorry about that.

07:28.854 --> 07:31.772
I just miss your mother so much.

07:31.806 --> 07:34.408
She was an angel that fell from heaven.

07:34.443 --> 07:35.910
Yes.

07:35.944 --> 07:37.912
So was Lucifer.

07:37.946 --> 07:40.164
Do you have a bathroom I could use?

07:40.198 --> 07:42.450
Down at the end of the hall.

07:42.484 --> 07:44.168
I may be in there a while
because I have

07:44.202 --> 07:46.587
a gluten thing that turns
my business white.

07:46.621 --> 07:49.623
Just go!

07:54.662 --> 07:58.132
So, Martha, tell me
some more funny Colleen stories.

08:02.504 --> 08:04.722
Colleen had two night tables?

08:04.773 --> 08:06.240
<i>Kama sutra?</i>

08:10.529 --> 08:12.313
Who is "M"?

08:19.788 --> 08:21.572
Shmesbians!

08:21.623 --> 08:23.574
Where are my manners?
This is Florida.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.826
Let me boil up a pot of hot gatorade.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.961
Is blue okay?

08:31.699 --> 08:33.082
Jack, bedroom...

08:33.135 --> 08:34.635
Lies.
Martha's been telling me

08:34.669 --> 08:36.419
Colleen loved children and animals.

08:36.471 --> 08:38.972
The only animal Colleen
ever bought me was a myna bird

08:39.006 --> 08:41.842
who was later revealed to be
Colleen's personal spy.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.309
I told that bird everything.

08:43.345 --> 08:44.929
No, Jack, it's not a scam.

08:44.980 --> 08:48.382
I think Martha and Colleen
were... together.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.317
- Have you lost your mind?
- It's a thing.

08:50.352 --> 08:52.052
Men die first,
and these older women are alone

08:52.070 --> 08:53.487
and turn to each other
for companionship,

08:53.522 --> 08:55.489
like my Aunt Linda
and her roommate, Jean.

08:55.524 --> 08:56.564
But they weren't lesbians.

08:56.575 --> 08:58.058
My God, of course they were!

08:58.076 --> 08:59.726
Lemon, listen to what you're saying.

08:59.744 --> 09:01.195
Colleen Donaghy was gay?

09:01.229 --> 09:02.696
She stopped watching the bruins

09:02.730 --> 09:04.915
because Derek Sanderson's
mustache made him look,

09:04.950 --> 09:07.168
"like he takes his sandwich
with a pickle."

09:07.202 --> 09:09.336
They shared a bed, Jack...
A sleep number bed,

09:09.371 --> 09:11.755
set to two drastically different
firmness levels.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.574
Only an insane person would do that

09:13.592 --> 09:14.625
if they were sleeping alone.

09:14.676 --> 09:15.742
Insane!

09:15.760 --> 09:17.244
Martha tricked Colleen into thinking

09:17.262 --> 09:18.345
she was her friend,

09:18.380 --> 09:20.097
and of course two friends
can share a bed.

09:20.131 --> 09:22.466
For example, Abraham Lincoln
and his roommate,

09:22.517 --> 09:24.852
Joshua fry speed,
slept in the same bed together

09:24.886 --> 09:27.354
until Joshua died from dancing
too long at a party.

09:29.441 --> 09:30.774
The gatorade's on.

09:30.809 --> 09:33.110
While we're waiting,
I DVR'd a documentary

09:33.144 --> 09:36.263
about the woman who designed
all of pat summitt's blazers.

09:41.138 --> 09:43.419
Kenneth, we have a sign affidavit

09:43.463 --> 09:44.713
regarding this Hazel situation

09:44.747 --> 09:47.582
from everyone on the <i>TGS</i> crew
except you.

09:47.616 --> 09:49.751
Look, I get it.

09:49.785 --> 09:52.421
I know how former lovers
can have a hold over you

09:52.455 --> 09:53.972
long after they're gone.

09:54.007 --> 09:55.891
In some ways, I'm still pinned

09:55.925 --> 09:57.526
under a passed-out
Harvey Weinstein,

09:57.560 --> 09:58.994
and it's Thanksgiving.

09:59.028 --> 10:01.813
But the truth is,
Hazel is gone, Ken Jennings,

10:01.848 --> 10:04.983
and to prove it, we hid a camera
on a gigolo friend of ours

10:05.018 --> 10:07.185
and asked him to seduce Hazel.

10:07.236 --> 10:08.557
Sloppy Rodney...
Do you know him?

10:08.571 --> 10:09.821
He has syphilis.

10:09.856 --> 10:11.773
Hey, baby, you want to get down?

10:11.807 --> 10:13.191
Sloppy Rodney?

10:13.242 --> 10:15.327
It's me, Richard Drench.

10:15.361 --> 10:16.945
I remember that ass.

10:18.498 --> 10:20.582
Please stop.

10:20.616 --> 10:24.152
Hazel isn't the reason
I won't sign that affidavit.

10:24.170 --> 10:26.654
The truth is, I have seen
a lot of inappropriate things

10:26.672 --> 10:27.923
here at <i>TGS,</i>

10:27.957 --> 10:29.674
and I don't want to lie about it.

10:29.709 --> 10:30.926
What's the big deal?

10:30.960 --> 10:32.294
Lying is easy.

10:32.328 --> 10:34.212
For example, there isn't
a hole in my pocket

10:34.263 --> 10:35.847
I keep touching my penis through.

10:35.882 --> 10:36.882
See? Easy.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.666
Not for me, sir.

10:38.684 --> 10:41.019
I've lost a lot this past year.

10:41.054 --> 10:44.056
I went from being a page to a janitor.

10:44.107 --> 10:45.974
My girlfriend dumped me.

10:46.008 --> 10:49.311
The only thing I have left
is my integrity.

10:49.345 --> 10:52.531
Now, you both know
I would do anything for you.

10:52.565 --> 10:55.067
But I want you to think long and hard

10:55.118 --> 10:58.370
before you ask me
to sign that affidavit,

10:58.404 --> 11:01.573
because you'd be making me
give up who I am.

11:01.624 --> 11:04.626
- Whatever. Sign it.
- Sign it.

11:08.131 --> 11:10.465
I apologize.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.751
We never had the need for
a second bedroom around here.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.553
This is usually where I store

11:14.587 --> 11:17.973
my woodworking tools
and the pottery I make.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.396
What's the problem, Lemon?

11:24.430 --> 11:25.814
They're just lumpy flowers.

11:25.848 --> 11:28.550
Now, I don't know who usually
sleeps on which side,

11:28.568 --> 11:30.885
so I put a strawberry calcium chew

11:30.903 --> 11:32.571
on both night tables for you, Liz.

11:32.605 --> 11:33.605
We're coworkers,
Ms. Edwards.

11:33.656 --> 11:34.656
We're not...
No, no, no.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.942
I'm sorry.
I just assumed...

11:36.993 --> 11:38.226
That's quite all right.

11:38.244 --> 11:39.778
A lot of people are making
wild assumptions today.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.947
Our relationship is purely platonic,

11:41.998 --> 11:44.332
if Plato had an elderly,
shut-in aunt.

11:44.367 --> 11:45.367
You know what Plato did have?

11:45.401 --> 11:46.681
A gay relationship with Socrates.

11:46.702 --> 11:47.902
Lemon, the only way
you're like Socrates

11:47.920 --> 11:49.421
is you have the body hair
of a Greek man.

11:49.455 --> 11:50.922
Are you sure you aren't married?

11:50.957 --> 11:52.791
'Cause this seems pretty married.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.626
Siri, find me the nearest hotel.

11:54.677 --> 11:56.178
Finding hookers.
Is that right?

11:56.212 --> 11:57.596
You don't want to go out.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.414
The Vietnam vets
are starting to retire,

11:59.432 --> 12:02.083
and they get antsy at night
around all these palm trees.

12:02.118 --> 12:03.118
No, that's all right.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.603
We can sleep together,

12:04.637 --> 12:06.888
because there's nothing weird
about two friends sharing a bed,

12:06.922 --> 12:09.941
- right, Jack?
- Of course not.

12:13.762 --> 12:15.864
Your pajamas have a turtleneck.

12:15.898 --> 12:16.938
They're from the L.L. Bean

12:16.949 --> 12:18.984
maritime professional collection.

12:19.035 --> 12:20.986
So what way do you want

12:21.037 --> 12:22.787
to totally normally sleep together?

12:22.822 --> 12:25.824
Face-to-face,
or butt-to-butt?

12:28.711 --> 12:31.713
Careful...
Old mattress.

12:39.722 --> 12:40.972
It goes without saying, Lemon,

12:41.007 --> 12:42.591
that nothing will happen
in this bed tonight,

12:42.625 --> 12:45.026
and I am referring,
of course, to your...

12:45.061 --> 12:46.328
Digestive failings.

12:46.362 --> 12:48.230
I'd laugh, but I'm trying not to do

12:48.264 --> 12:50.982
the thing that you just referred to.

12:56.939 --> 12:59.991
Why didn't anything
ever happen between us?

13:00.026 --> 13:01.443
Good God, Lemon.

13:01.477 --> 13:03.712
If you're trying to conjure
my mother's ghost,

13:03.746 --> 13:05.497
you could just shake a jar of coins

13:05.531 --> 13:06.982
while praising Jimmy Carter.

13:07.016 --> 13:09.100
No, I'm not saying
I wanted something to happen.

13:09.135 --> 13:10.602
But why didn't something happen?

13:10.636 --> 13:12.204
We've spent a lot of time together.

13:12.255 --> 13:14.839
We've been drunk together
and day-drunk together

13:14.874 --> 13:16.541
and on the rebound at the same time,

13:16.592 --> 13:18.460
and also, you're kind of a slut.

13:18.494 --> 13:21.096
I did sleep with Jenna a lot
during season three.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.064
If I were a different person,

13:23.099 --> 13:24.799
would you have hit on me?

13:24.833 --> 13:26.351
I understand
what you're getting at, Lemon.

13:26.385 --> 13:28.703
There was a particularly
youth-oriented priest

13:28.738 --> 13:32.274
in my childhood parish who
went after everybody but me...

13:32.308 --> 13:35.076
Even fat Ralph, and he ate his boogers.

13:35.111 --> 13:37.145
I felt so unpretty.

13:37.179 --> 13:39.064
No, this isn't about appearance, Jack.

13:39.115 --> 13:40.848
Did nothing ever happen between us

13:40.866 --> 13:43.735
because I'm not fun?

13:43.786 --> 13:45.120
Good God, Lemon.

13:45.154 --> 13:47.122
Obviously, our relationship,
however you define it...

13:47.156 --> 13:48.490
Mentor/mentee...

13:48.524 --> 13:49.958
Sister-ployee/work oracle...

13:49.992 --> 13:53.211
Is more interesting
than some dating scenario.

13:53.246 --> 13:55.130
And obviously, to ruin what we have

13:55.164 --> 13:57.582
with a tawdry,
yet expert sexual encounter

13:57.633 --> 13:58.800
would've been a mistake.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.885
Obviously, but is it
the kind of mistake

14:00.920 --> 14:03.588
that I should have made?

14:03.623 --> 14:05.307
Tracy told me I haven't lived.

14:05.341 --> 14:07.842
You're allowing Tracy to criticize

14:07.876 --> 14:09.344
your life choices...
Tracy Jordan?

14:15.651 --> 14:17.435
Now what?

14:17.486 --> 14:18.687
But he's right.

14:18.721 --> 14:20.322
I haven't done anything impulsive ever.

14:20.356 --> 14:22.691
I don't have any tattoos
or broken bones.

14:22.725 --> 14:23.775
I've never been high,

14:23.826 --> 14:25.443
except for that choir trip to Montreal

14:25.494 --> 14:27.579
where I accidentally ate
a pound of marijuana.

14:27.613 --> 14:29.681
Also, maybe I was
never attracted to you

14:29.715 --> 14:31.366
because you're the kind
of person who finds a way

14:31.400 --> 14:33.752
to talk about herself while
lying in my dead mother's bed.

14:33.786 --> 14:35.170
Okay.

14:35.204 --> 14:36.621
Well, for the record, it's mutual.

14:36.672 --> 14:38.573
I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit

14:38.591 --> 14:41.092
to be with a middle-aged man
with crippling mommy issues.

14:41.127 --> 14:43.995
First of all,
it's "champing" at the bit.

14:44.030 --> 14:45.547
Horses champ.

14:45.581 --> 14:47.749
And second of all, I'm not going
to fight in bed with a woman

14:47.767 --> 14:48.850
I'm not even having sex with.

14:48.884 --> 14:50.435
Why? Is it weird?

14:50.469 --> 14:52.304
Of course it's weird.

14:52.355 --> 14:55.106
- Lincoln was super gay.
- Thank you.

14:55.141 --> 14:58.727
And I don't even want to think
about my mother.

14:58.761 --> 15:01.429
And I know those pots aren't flowers.

15:01.447 --> 15:04.399
They're my mother's vagina.

15:07.995 --> 15:11.636
Jay-Mo, I like to flouring a
joke about bjork's swan dress...

15:11.671 --> 15:12.671
Tired.

15:12.672 --> 15:13.672
I've seen dresses

15:13.673 --> 15:14.806
that look fly,

15:14.841 --> 15:16.558
but never dresses that can fly.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.227
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

15:19.262 --> 15:22.414
I've got this weird,
sick feeling in my stomach.

15:22.448 --> 15:23.515
Me too.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.233
It's the same feeling I got in 1997

15:25.268 --> 15:27.052
when that jury foreman
looked at me and said,

15:27.086 --> 15:28.153
"guilty!"

15:28.187 --> 15:30.739
And I had to close my water park.

15:30.773 --> 15:33.825
I forgot to make an opening
at the end of the slide.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.660
Is that what this is...
Guilt?

15:35.695 --> 15:36.945
I don't think so.

15:36.996 --> 15:39.414
I mean, what have we done
to feel guilty about?

15:39.448 --> 15:42.083
We don't care that
we made Kenneth lie, right?

15:42.118 --> 15:44.619
No! Come on!
It's Kenneth.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.922
Although he has been acting
a little different

15:46.956 --> 15:48.924
since yesterday.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.675
What?
Did I miss a spot?

15:50.710 --> 15:52.243
I don't care.

15:52.261 --> 15:54.679
All I care about is which jazz club

15:54.714 --> 15:57.632
I'm going to tonight.

15:57.683 --> 15:59.217
He's broken.

16:01.971 --> 16:03.772
Good morning, Jack.

16:03.806 --> 16:05.256
You sleep okay?

16:05.274 --> 16:07.559
Colleen's myna bird told me
you spent the night in the car.

16:07.593 --> 16:11.146
I slept fine.

16:11.197 --> 16:13.982
Before you leave,
I wanted you to have this.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.567
That was taken at the wrap party

16:15.601 --> 16:17.652
for our community center's
production of <i>Grease.</i>

16:17.703 --> 16:19.321
Your mother was Sandy.

16:19.372 --> 16:21.239
Well, the fourth Sandy.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.074
The first three died
falling off the car

16:23.108 --> 16:24.409
during "Summer lovin'."

16:24.443 --> 16:27.445
I don't know the last time
I saw her so happy.

16:31.667 --> 16:36.054
I'm glad she had you
to, take care of her.

16:37.790 --> 16:38.974
Lemon?

16:39.008 --> 16:41.142
Jack, you need to come
to Orlando and pick me up.

16:41.177 --> 16:44.145
I'm in Harry Potter world jail.

16:45.848 --> 16:48.850
Kenneth Parcell isn't signing
your precious affidavit.

16:48.901 --> 16:52.187
That is a Christmas card
from my estranged daughter.

16:52.238 --> 16:53.655
Tell him, Ken.

16:53.689 --> 16:56.024
If you've ever experienced
anything inappropriate at work,

16:56.075 --> 16:59.077
just tell the truth.

17:06.652 --> 17:07.919
Well, sir...

17:07.954 --> 17:09.588
No, Kenneth, you have
something in your teeth.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.489
I'm just trying to lick it off.

17:11.507 --> 17:14.626
Let me do it.
I'm your friend.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.711
Want to see a porno my cousin is in?

17:29.341 --> 17:31.175
To close a very important deal,

17:31.193 --> 17:32.953
I'm going to need
to loan you to David Geffen

17:32.979 --> 17:34.062
for the weekend.

17:34.113 --> 17:35.730
Why do I even take birth control pills

17:35.781 --> 17:37.649
if I'm always gonna be alone?

17:37.683 --> 17:39.150
You might as well take them, Kenneth.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.069
You take them!

17:41.120 --> 17:42.404
Take them!

17:42.455 --> 17:45.690
Now, for days
that weren't my birthday...

17:45.708 --> 17:47.993
Get me Philadelphia.

17:48.027 --> 17:50.495
'Cause I wanted to sound cool,
okay, Tucker?

17:50.529 --> 17:53.832
Fine, get me Gary Derekson.

17:57.303 --> 17:58.336
Well, I did it.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.056
I tried to live life, and it sucked.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.842
I came here without studying
the park map beforehand,

18:03.876 --> 18:05.644
which is how I ended up in a long line

18:05.678 --> 18:07.211
that turned out to just be
a crowd of people

18:07.229 --> 18:09.014
watching two owls have sex.

18:09.048 --> 18:10.432
Then the park started to fill up,

18:10.483 --> 18:13.384
but, I'm being spontaneous,
so I tried to cut the line

18:13.402 --> 18:15.603
for the flight of the hippogriff,

18:15.655 --> 18:18.273
which is when Duncan here caught me.

18:18.324 --> 18:19.941
What is the point, Jack?

18:19.992 --> 18:22.027
I am who I am,
and I'm never gonna change.

18:22.061 --> 18:23.445
I'll die full of regrets,

18:23.496 --> 18:25.080
like that time I sat
next to Richard Grieco

18:25.114 --> 18:27.615
on an airplane and just let him
read his <i>Hustlers</i>

18:27.667 --> 18:29.834
without ever telling him I was a fan.

18:29.869 --> 18:30.952
Lemon, you're wrong.

18:31.003 --> 18:32.537
People can change.

18:32.571 --> 18:35.006
Maybe tomorrow, maybe when you're 85,

18:35.041 --> 18:38.093
you'll find a reason to do something

18:38.127 --> 18:39.294
totally out of character.

18:39.345 --> 18:43.131
After all, that's what Colleen did.

18:43.182 --> 18:44.632
Not to make this about me,

18:44.684 --> 18:45.917
but are you admitting that I was right

18:45.935 --> 18:49.888
about your mother's
late-in-life lez-out?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.690
I just can't believe it.

18:51.724 --> 18:54.192
I know, and a woman
of color too... good for her.

18:54.226 --> 18:57.145
No, not that.
I can't believe she was happy.

18:57.196 --> 18:59.064
She was Mrs. silly.

18:59.098 --> 19:00.699
- Sketch idea.
- At the end,

19:00.733 --> 19:02.266
when she said she just wanted me
to be happy,

19:02.284 --> 19:03.605
I thought she was being sarcastic,

19:03.619 --> 19:05.436
because when I was growing up,
I thought people

19:05.454 --> 19:07.122
who wanted to be happy were weak...

19:07.156 --> 19:09.908
Hippies, Italians,
kindergarten teachers.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.626
What am I supposed to do with this?

19:11.660 --> 19:13.661
I don't know how to be happy.

19:13.713 --> 19:14.913
What are you talking about?

19:14.947 --> 19:16.548
That is enough
of your black Irish nonsense.

19:16.582 --> 19:17.799
Of course you're happy.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.634
It's never been the goal, Lemon.

19:19.668 --> 19:21.753
The goal has always been
money or prestige

19:21.787 --> 19:24.472
or, when playing hockey, the goal.

19:24.507 --> 19:26.457
Jack, in an hour, you are
flying to New York City

19:26.475 --> 19:29.928
on a private jet
to a party celebrating you

19:29.962 --> 19:32.147
as Kabletown's next CEO.

19:32.181 --> 19:33.542
It's everything you've ever wanted.

19:33.566 --> 19:36.518
And Colleen is looking down
on you right now,

19:36.569 --> 19:39.237
and you're happier
than you've ever been.

19:39.271 --> 19:42.357
Of course I am.

19:53.819 --> 19:54.919
Hello, Beverly.

19:54.954 --> 19:56.254
It's just Bev, Liz.

19:56.288 --> 19:57.705
My mother died while naming me.

19:57.757 --> 20:00.458
Well, I do have an opportunity
for an immediate placement.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.093
Really?
Okay.

20:02.128 --> 20:03.378
There is one issue.

20:03.429 --> 20:05.797
It's two children...
A brother and a sister,

20:05.831 --> 20:07.015
and we don't want to split them up.

20:07.049 --> 20:09.184
Two?
Boy, that wasn't our plan.

20:09.218 --> 20:11.102
<i>I know.
It's a lot to take on.</i>

20:11.137 --> 20:12.437
Why don't you discuss it

20:12.471 --> 20:13.688
with that little action figure
you're married to?

20:13.722 --> 20:15.073
No, no, we'll do it.

20:15.107 --> 20:17.108
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we'll take them.

20:17.143 --> 20:19.060
We'll take both kids.

20:19.111 --> 20:20.695
There you are, Liz.

20:20.729 --> 20:22.280
I'm on my way up to see Jack,

20:22.314 --> 20:25.150
but as long as I'm still CEO,
I want to say two things.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.652
One, did you get a little sun?
You're glowing.

20:27.686 --> 20:31.022
And two, because of the lawsuit
and the P.R. nightmare

20:31.040 --> 20:33.158
and the den of sin you've built here,

20:33.192 --> 20:35.577
I have to go ahead and cancel <i>TGS.</i>

20:35.628 --> 20:38.630
Next Friday is your last show.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.250
Great news, Liz.

20:42.301 --> 20:44.202
Kenneth doesn't have
different hair anymore.

20:46.889 --> 20:49.507
Liz?
Liz?

20:52.423 --> 20:53.907
I showed up without a bra one day,

20:53.909 --> 20:56.759
and I was viciously harassed
until I put on a shirt.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.378
I once saw Kenneth Parcell naked.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.046
It was horrible.

21:01.048 --> 21:03.165
His body is just a smooth beige tube

21:03.167 --> 21:04.350
with a head.

21:04.352 --> 21:06.435
Frank Rossitano was always trying

21:06.437 --> 21:08.470
to give me pornography

21:08.472 --> 21:10.439
that I had given him
in the first place.

21:10.441 --> 21:11.907
I mean, what a re-gifter.

21:11.909 --> 21:15.510
There were these
two African-American giants

21:15.512 --> 21:18.197
that were always pressuring me

21:18.199 --> 21:20.314
to join their book club.

21:20.370 --> 21:23.567
Can have please a glass with water?
Thank you.
