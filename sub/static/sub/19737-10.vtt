32:13.883 --> 32:15.851
it's quite possible
that all of this violence

32:15.885 --> 32:17.986
is focused solely on his mother.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.721
I mean, think about
what Sara Yee told us

"It's not your fault.
It's how you were raised."

32:22.692 --> 32:24.326

32:24.360 --> 32:25.894
for his sister's suicide?

32:25.929 --> 32:27.696
That would explain why
it's so important for him

32:27.730 --> 32:29.798
to display the bodies on
the outside of the buildings.

32:29.832 --> 32:31.533
Right, because staging
them there would act

32:31.568 --> 32:33.669

against his mother's work.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.383
Right, but in Michael's

32:48.418 --> 32:51.219
he considered himself a
victim of his mother's neglect.

32:51.254 --> 32:53.322
