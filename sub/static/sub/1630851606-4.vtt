00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
[upbeat reggae music playing]

00:13.179 --> 00:14.723
-[John B] Okay, ready?
-Yeah.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.018
-One, two…
-[grunts]

00:20.270 --> 00:23.565
Hey, listen,
we're gonna get some gas, find a phone,

00:23.648 --> 00:25.066
and get out of here, all right?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.651
How are we gonna pay for the gas?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.653
Don't worry about it. We'll figure it out.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.073
[Kie] They're fancy people.
They've had three governors in the family.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.284
They've run Charleston
for, like, 300 years.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.995
[JJ] These Kooks
make our Kooks look like Pogues.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.750
You sure this is the place, Pope?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.127
Pretty sure.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.212
All right.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.343
[JJ] Fat City, for sure.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.306
[Pope] Twenty-seven King Street.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.933
[JJ] Talk about home security.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.021
Are those spikes to keep people out?

01:04.355 --> 01:05.190
No.

01:05.273 --> 01:07.275
The slave quarters are over there.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.071
[sighs] These spikes
were to keep people in.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.243
[John B] That looks so good. I'm starving.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.541
-We gotta get some food. Follow my lead.
-Okay.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.168
[indistinct chattering]

01:26.086 --> 01:27.504
How is everything?

01:27.587 --> 01:30.465
-Is there anything else I can get for--
-[gasps]

01:30.548 --> 01:31.883
Oh my God. Uh…

01:32.467 --> 01:34.135
You idiot.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.553
I'm so sorry.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.889
Oh my God. Your shoes!

01:37.972 --> 01:40.391
-This is a $1,700 jacket!
-[Sarah] I am so sorry.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.644
A hundred percent on me.
I'm sorry. I bumped into him.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.104
Is there anything I can do?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.481
[John B] No, I'm sorry. This is on me.
I bumped into him.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.526
-You're saying you're gonna pay for it?
-I don't have any money. I'm broke.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.277
-Of course you don't.
-[server] Sir--

01:51.361 --> 01:52.320
Pathetic!

01:52.904 --> 01:55.240
-[server] Let me talk to a manager, okay?
-I'm sorry.

01:56.908 --> 02:00.328
-No need for name-calling, sir.
-[server] Here you go. sir. Anything…

02:00.411 --> 02:02.831
-Did you get it?
-What are you talking about?

02:03.915 --> 02:04.791
You mean this?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.751
Oh my God.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.463
-I'll sugar mama you.
-[John B] I was hoping you would say that.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.090
[knocks echoing]

02:13.508 --> 02:14.926
You think that was too much?

02:15.009 --> 02:17.345
It echoed the entire house.
That's for sure.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.389
-So they definitely heard it.
-Maybe nobody's home.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.898
You must be Pope.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.567
Um…

02:32.944 --> 02:34.237
Are you Mr. Limbrey?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.615
Ms. Limbrey was expecting you yesterday.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.952
Oh. I'm… I'm sorry.
My car broke down on the way up here.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.204
Carburetor blew up
in the middle of Nowheresville.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.206
Sorry about that.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.127
Yeah, she was, uh, real upset
when you didn't show up.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.714
We tried to call,
but there's no number on the invitation.

02:52.797 --> 02:53.715
[JJ clears throat]

02:53.840 --> 02:56.759
-We got here as fast as we could.
-She also expected you to come alone.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.638
I mean, these are my friends. They helped
find the Royal Merchant too. I--

03:00.722 --> 03:03.516
The instructions were explicit.
Your friends can stay outside.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.977
[JJ] We're kind of a package deal, man.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.813
JJ. It's okay. I got this.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.649
I'll be good.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.319
Yeah. We'll be right here.

03:14.903 --> 03:15.987
-Keep the car running.
-Yep.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.072
[suspenseful music playing]

03:31.711 --> 03:33.046
[sighs]

03:37.258 --> 03:38.509
Just wait in here.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.387
Ms. Limbrey will be right with you.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.865
[sighs]

04:11.417 --> 04:14.254
[clanking]

04:15.713 --> 04:18.341
[footsteps approaching]

04:24.222 --> 04:25.223
Mr. Heyward.

04:25.974 --> 04:26.891
[chuckles softly]

04:27.642 --> 04:28.935
I'm Carla Limbrey.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.604
Uh, Pope.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.775
People call me Pope.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.777
[Limbrey] Have a seat.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.953
Thank you so much for everything.
This really means a lot to me.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.579
Can I offer you something?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.707
I'm okay. Thank you.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.542
Well, you look thirsty.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.802
I think a toast is in order.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.470
To finding the unfindable.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.598
Against all odds,

05:07.682 --> 05:10.560
you and your friends managed
to beat everyone to the Royal Merchant,

05:10.643 --> 05:11.894
including me,

05:11.978 --> 05:14.605
and Lord knows I tried.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.568
I also know that you've since lost
the gold to Ward Cameron.

05:19.068 --> 05:19.902
How do you know that?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.196
Ward Cameron and I have
a long and tortured history.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.073
I funded his first development project.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.701
-But he wouldn't tell you--
-[Limbrey] He didn't need to.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.579
Ward and I were partners
in the search for the Royal Merchant,

05:29.662 --> 05:32.040
and I'm afraid that Big John Routledge

05:32.123 --> 05:34.542
was not the only one
that Ward double-crossed.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.004
Okay.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.673
[inhales]

05:42.216 --> 05:43.217
What else do you know?

05:43.301 --> 05:47.430
I know that Rafe Cameron killed
Sheriff Peterkin. I have proof of it.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.683
-So you can clear John B's name?
-Easily, at any time.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.358
[Gavin on tape] …of the gun.
He's protecting his son.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.902
It was Rafe Cameron
who killed Sheriff Peterkin.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.278
-Gavin.
-Gotta be honest--

06:02.362 --> 06:04.322
I know exactly what happened
on that tarmac.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.949
[Pope] So you have the evidence,
and you know he's innocent.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.578
Why don't you just go clear his name?
It's the right thing to do.

06:10.661 --> 06:14.374
My friend, the Limbreys did not maintain
their position in the Lowcountry

06:14.457 --> 06:16.167
for these past 300 years

06:16.250 --> 06:19.462
by giving away
something of value for free.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.422
Yes, I can exonerate your friend,

06:21.506 --> 06:26.260
but first, there is something that I want.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.640
It's a little thing, really.
I think you know what it is.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.476
I want the key.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.896
A key?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.607
-[Limbrey scoffs]
-Like truck keys?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.818
I have house keys.
I'm… I'm sorry. I don't know-- A key?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
I'm afraid our relationship
won't be very productive

06:43.986 --> 06:45.947
if we aren't honest with each other.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.409
Denmark's key.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.161
As in Denmark Tanny?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.079
Yes.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.499
Ms. Limbrey, I'm sorry, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.793
But for my friend, I'll… I'll go find it.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.421
I'll… I'll do what I need to do.
I'll go find one if you need it.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.172
But I don't know
what you're talking about,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.424
and I don't have it on me.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.385
[Limbrey] Come now.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.558
Do you recognize this?

07:18.354 --> 07:19.355
Ring any bells?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.191
No.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.277
I'm sorry. It doesn't.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.319
Hmm.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.157
You can keep that. [chuckles]

07:35.997 --> 07:37.081
Come with me.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.293
I'd like to show you something. I think…

07:41.210 --> 07:43.171
I think you'll find it interesting.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.052
Look, if Limbrey is legit,

07:51.095 --> 07:54.515
then Ward gets arrested,
and maybe Sarah gets the gold.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.101
Does that look voluntary?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.603
[man] Keep walking.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.563
-[JJ] That would be a negative.
-[Kie] Come on.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.064
-Wait, hold on, hold on.
-What?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.694
-[JJ] They're going into the alley.
-Go around back?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.988
-Yeah. We'll meet them on the other side.
-Okay.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.407
-Hey, be chill. Be chill.
-Yeah, sure.

08:12.450 --> 08:16.162
All of this,
all the way down to the Ashley River,

08:16.245 --> 08:17.622
was owned by my family.

08:18.706 --> 08:23.461
The Limbreys have lived in the house
since it was built 280 years ago.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.546
That's where the slaves were kept.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.799
Thank goodness
we've made progress since then.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.511
Yeah, thank goodness.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.137
Look, where did they go?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.847
[JJ] What if they went underground?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.934
Because in C.H.U.D., when they took people
down into the sewers,

08:38.017 --> 08:40.895
it would turn the humans into humanoids
'cause of the radiation.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.439
-And then all of a sudden--
-Focus. That doesn't make any sense.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.399
-Right. Sorry. Did you see him?
-No.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.861
All right. [clears throat]
How many hot dogs you want?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.155
Okay, like, 50.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.367
-Fifty hot dogs?
-A hundred. I don't care.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.832
[couple talking indistinctly]

09:01.916 --> 09:02.750
Shit.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.421
No.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.716
[breathing nervously]

09:10.800 --> 09:12.301
They ran out of the real deal.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.636
-Sh.
-They're vegan. What?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.805
[whispers] He's right there!
He's literally right--

09:16.639 --> 09:18.349
Hey! You!

09:18.432 --> 09:21.644
Come here! Thieves!
You stole my money! Come here.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.814
-Hey, come here! Come here, you!
-[John B and Sarah grunt]

09:31.279 --> 09:32.905
Here lies Denmark Tanny,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.616
the famous ex-slave.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.867
You know the story.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.078
What… what story?

09:39.161 --> 09:43.708
Denmark Tanny was a freedman,
a wealthy planter.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.460
He was able to buy
the freedom of his three sons,

09:46.544 --> 09:50.381
but when he tried
to buy his wife and daughter's freedom,

09:51.132 --> 09:54.385
my paternal ancestors refused.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.638
When his wife, Cecilia,
tried to run with the baby,

09:58.681 --> 10:00.474
they set the hounds on her.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.268
[bell tolling]

10:02.852 --> 10:06.647
Cecilia drowned trying to escape,
the baby survived,

10:06.731 --> 10:10.151
and Denmark was hung…

10:12.653 --> 10:15.323
allegedly for abetting a slave revolt

10:15.406 --> 10:19.785
but really for gathering
the remains of his wife.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.791
Never heard this story?

10:27.960 --> 10:28.794
No.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.048
And I think once is enough.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.466
Hey!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.179
-You think that I'm stupid?
-No. No, no, I don't.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.681
Why else
would the Routledge boy involve you?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.726
-Your family has the key.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.019
Hey. Did Ward get to you?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.480
No. Ward Cameron? Are you crazy?

10:47.563 --> 10:50.024
The key leads to the cross,
the Cross of Santo Domingo.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.069
"The real treasure lies
at the foot of the angel."

10:53.944 --> 10:58.074
Those were Denmark's last words.
Does that ring any bells?

10:58.157 --> 11:01.327
No, it doesn't.
It doesn't ring any bells and, um…

11:02.870 --> 11:06.207
Uh, thank you, but I'm… I'm gonna go back
to the 21st century now.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.466
We'll trade with his father.
His son for the key.

11:18.969 --> 11:19.970
Go.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.147
Crazy people.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.441
Okay. All right.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.360
[panting]

11:36.987 --> 11:38.489
[suspenseful music playing]

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
What you got?

11:48.332 --> 11:49.542
[crackling]

11:50.501 --> 11:51.460
[both grunting]

11:53.337 --> 11:55.464
[Pope grunting, groaning]

11:59.635 --> 12:01.345

-What you got?

12:03.055 --> 12:05.141
[crackling]

12:05.808 --> 12:07.184

12:07.268 --> 12:09.729
-[grunts]
-[shouts, groaning]

12:11.272 --> 12:12.440
[Pope gasping]

12:12.523 --> 12:14.817
[both grunting, groaning]

12:19.655 --> 12:20.531
Come on!

12:21.449 --> 12:22.950
-Pope!
-[panting]

12:23.033 --> 12:24.994
-[JJ] Pope, come on!
-[Kie] Come on!

12:25.703 --> 12:27.997
-[JJ] Go! Just leave him! Leave him!
-[groaning]

12:29.415 --> 12:30.332
[grunts]

12:31.125 --> 12:32.042
[grunts]

12:33.377 --> 12:34.503
-[JJ] Go!
-[Kie] Okay.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.421
[JJ] Go, go, go!

12:37.047 --> 12:39.091
-Scoot over.
-Ow! Who were those people?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.719
-We're getting out of here.
-That was crazy. Let's get out of here.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.098
[tires squealing]

12:46.182 --> 12:47.558
[panting]

36:53.544 --> 36:55.588
I didn't think
I was ever gonna see you again,

36:55.671 --> 36:57.173
and here you are. You're…

36:59.258 --> 37:00.885
in your backyard. You're home.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.803
I'm not coming home.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.056
-Sare Bear, you're here--
-I said stay back.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.099
I'm staying back.
I'm right here. I'm just--

37:10.603 --> 37:13.189
I can't stand to see you hurt, and…

37:15.942 --> 37:19.612
I just want to protect you,
and I can't do that when you're with him,

37:19.695 --> 37:21.530
and he's got you in these situations.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.200
You just can't even know
what it's been like.

37:24.825 --> 37:25.826
I thought you--

37:28.955 --> 37:30.206
I thought you were dead.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.794
-Do you remember the night of the storm?
-[Ward] Yeah.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.337
On the radio, you promised me

37:36.420 --> 37:38.839
that if I came back,
you would tell the truth.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.342
You remember?

37:45.346 --> 37:47.139
I'm going to testify against you.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.184
-That you lied.
-[sighs]

37:50.268 --> 37:52.603
[Sarah] And that Rafe lied
and that Rose lied.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.356
-Oh, sweetie.
-Just convince Rafe to turn himself in.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.068
I'm not gonna do that.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.198
But why? John B didn't shoot Peterkin.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.702
No, he didn't kill Sheriff Peterkin,
but he is the reason she's dead.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.619
What?

38:08.703 --> 38:11.372
[Ward] I offered to help him
for just the tiniest little bit

38:12.164 --> 38:15.334
of what was already rightfully mine,
and he said no. You know why he said no?

38:15.418 --> 38:17.878
Because he's greedy,
like his father before him.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.631
He's so crazy for all that goddamn gold

38:20.715 --> 38:24.135
that he wouldn't share any of it
with the one person that could help him.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.511
So crazy for that gold

38:25.594 --> 38:27.722
that he pulls his van
in front of our airplane

38:27.805 --> 38:29.974
almost killing you and me on that tarmac.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.810
That's why we were even there.
That's why Peterkin was there.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.645
That's why it all happened. Him.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.024
No.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.736
It was Rafe.

38:44.488 --> 38:48.034
And he's gonna get caught,
and he's gonna drag all of you with him.

38:48.117 --> 38:48.951
Honey,

38:50.244 --> 38:51.245
he's not,

38:51.871 --> 38:55.374
because I'm not gonna let it happen.
You still don't understand.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.462
Sarah, this family, all of this…

39:02.673 --> 39:04.091
I didn't have it growing up…

39:06.469 --> 39:07.470
any of it.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.433
And if you think there is anything

39:12.516 --> 39:14.727
that I wouldn't do
to keep us all together,

39:15.311 --> 39:17.480
sweetheart,
you haven't been paying attention.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.902
If you don't tell the truth,
you'll never see me again.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.195
You don't mean that.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.616
You're my favorite, Sarah. Rafe knows it.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.202
But no.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.623
I'm not gonna choose
between my daughter and my son.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.625
I can't.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.378
But I will tell you
that, in the end, it will be okay.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.797
We will all be okay,
and we will be right back here.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.007
We'll be together, and we'll be a family.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.392
What happened to you?

40:06.153 --> 40:07.613
[sniffling, crying]

40:20.584 --> 40:22.378
[line ringing]

40:23.295 --> 40:26.006
-[woman] Kildare County Sheriff.
-Sheriff Shoupe, please.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.508
[woman] Who can I tell him is calling?

40:27.591 --> 40:28.759
-Ward Cameron.
-[woman] Hold please.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.678
The tape, you heard it?

40:31.804 --> 40:34.974
Just a few seconds.
But it's definitely Gavin.

40:37.184 --> 40:40.312
I think Ward might have betrayed Limbrey
like he did your dad.

40:42.606 --> 40:46.402
Do you think Limbrey and your dad
might have been working together?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.577
[John B] Hey, there she is.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.415
[Kie] Sarah!

41:00.833 --> 41:01.834
[Pope] You made it.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.295
[John B] What happened?

41:05.546 --> 41:06.630
So, how'd it go?

41:07.715 --> 41:10.551
You guys were right.
It didn't work. [sniffles]

41:11.302 --> 41:13.929
-Sorry.
-Welp, then that settles it, guys.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.016
Now, y'all need to load up
in the paddy wagon

41:17.099 --> 41:18.893
and get the heck out of Dodge right now.

41:18.976 --> 41:22.146
Right, you'll need supplies, and
you'll have to split as soon as possible.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.564
Guys, I think it's too late.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.484
-[siren wailing]
-[John B] They followed you here?

41:29.361 --> 41:31.697
-Must've been your father.
-We have to find another way out.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.659
Stay on the beach
with your hands in the air!

41:35.743 --> 41:36.952
-[Pope] Go now! Go!
-Sarah!

41:37.036 --> 41:39.246
-Go! Guys!
-[Pope] Run! Come on! Come on!

41:41.123 --> 41:42.124
[all panting]

41:43.876 --> 41:45.753
[officers yelling indistinctly]

41:45.836 --> 41:47.004
[JJ] We've got to outrun them!

41:47.087 --> 41:49.381
-[Pope] Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
-[Kie] Go!

41:50.382 --> 41:52.384
-[officer] Go, go!
-[indistinct chattering on radio]

41:52.468 --> 41:53.552
[Pope] Let's go! Let's go!

41:53.636 --> 41:54.720
-[Kie] Go!
-[John B] Go!

41:54.803 --> 41:56.138
Go! Go!

41:58.432 --> 41:59.975
[dramatic music playing]

42:00.059 --> 42:01.852
You're okay. You're okay.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.521
[indistinct chattering on radio]

42:03.604 --> 42:05.856
-[Kie] Sarah, you good?
-[John B] Yeah. You okay?

42:05.940 --> 42:07.441
-[Sarah] Yeah.
-[John B] Go! Go! Go!

42:07.525 --> 42:09.276
[officers speaking indistinctly]

42:10.069 --> 42:11.237
[whimpering]

42:11.320 --> 42:12.696
[John B] JJ, grab her hand.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.367
[officer] Move! Move! Move!

42:17.660 --> 42:19.453
-[Pope] Go!
-[JJ] Come on! Let's go.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.205
-Freeze!
-Stop!

42:21.288 --> 42:23.207
-[John B] Come on!
-[officer] Stay where you are!

42:23.290 --> 42:25.501
-[Pope] Go! Get up! Get up!
-[JJ] Go! Go! Go!

42:25.584 --> 42:27.169
-[grunting]
-[John B] Behind the tree!

42:27.253 --> 42:29.255
[group coughing, panting]

42:29.338 --> 42:31.340
[sirens wailing]

42:31.423 --> 42:34.009
-[indistinct shouting]
-We're trapped. They surrounded us.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.594
-[officer] Freeze!
-What do we do?

42:35.678 --> 42:37.596
[JJ] No getting out of it.
We gotta make a stand.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.849
-[panting]
-[officers shouting indistinctly]

42:43.686 --> 42:44.520
[Sarah whimpers]

42:44.603 --> 42:45.813
[officer] It's over now!

42:46.480 --> 42:47.606
[blowing]

42:47.690 --> 42:49.024
[officer] Don't move!

42:54.029 --> 42:55.072
[sighs]

42:56.615 --> 42:57.533
[sirens wailing]

43:08.961 --> 43:12.214
[officers shouting indistinctly
in background]

43:22.266 --> 43:23.642
[officer 1] Get those hands up now!

43:23.726 --> 43:25.102
It's gonna be all right.

43:25.686 --> 43:27.354
[officer 2] You're not going anywhere!

43:28.606 --> 43:29.523
Here we go.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.358
[siren wailing]

43:34.486 --> 43:37.448
[officer 3] Go around now! Nice and easy!

43:39.325 --> 43:40.284
John B!

43:42.161 --> 43:43.579
Step out into the clearing!

43:44.121 --> 43:46.123
-Get down. Do not move!
-[John B] I'm surrendering!

43:46.206 --> 43:47.958
-Don't move!
-[Thomas] Hands up, John B!

43:48.042 --> 43:50.878
[Shoupe] Stay right where you are.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

43:50.961 --> 43:53.339
-[Plumb] Don't move!
-Hey, listen, Shoupe, I wanna testify.

43:53.422 --> 43:56.675
It's about time. Get down. Do not move
a muscle. Everybody else, don't move.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.428
[Plumb] Don't move.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

43:59.511 --> 44:00.554
[JJ] Serious? Come on!

44:00.638 --> 44:01.722
[Shoupe] Hey, Thomas!

44:01.805 --> 44:04.099
-No!
-Stop! Let him go!

44:04.183 --> 44:05.142
[grunts]

44:05.225 --> 44:07.686
Sheriff, what is that?
You're gonna let that happen?

44:07.770 --> 44:09.104
Don't move!

44:09.188 --> 44:10.397
[Kie screaming indistinctly]

-Stand down!
-Get off!

44:13.734 --> 44:15.152
[panting]

44:15.235 --> 44:16.654
This is for Peterkin.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.281
-[grunts]
-[Kie] No!

44:21.367 --> 44:23.285
[upbeat reggae music playing]
