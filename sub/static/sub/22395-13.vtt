00:04.000 --> 00:10.625
So beautiful. So
radiant. So irresistible.

00:11.291 --> 00:14.750
Oh, boy! That is one tasty dish.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.583
I'll say.

00:18.375 --> 00:21.458
I thinks I'm in love.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.709
Well, what are you
waiting for? Go for it, goofy.

00:23.709 --> 00:27.792
Good idea, Mick. Time for
a little southern hospitality.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.083
<i>Excusez-moi, </i>miss.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.625
Oh, goofy, wait. You can't
go over there looking like that.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.250
What's wrong with the way I look?

00:36.250 --> 00:38.625
Uh, nothing. What he's trying to say is,

00:38.625 --> 00:39.959
a guy like you

00:39.959 --> 00:43.291
doesn't stand a chance
with a saucy dish like that.

00:43.291 --> 00:46.041
What? You say somethin', Donald?

00:46.041 --> 00:50.375
He said, "let's help our
bestest buddy get his true love."

00:50.375 --> 00:53.792
What? What would I do without you guys?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.333
Hug someone else?

00:55.750 --> 00:57.291
Don't worry, goofy.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.792
This makeup will have you
looking like a new man in no time.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.959
Now, let's see.
A-ha!

01:01.959 --> 01:03.667
A little of this...

01:05.250 --> 01:06.500
A little of this...

01:07.709 --> 01:09.500
And last but not least...

01:09.500 --> 01:11.000
Ta-da!

01:11.834 --> 01:14.000
How do I look?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.083
Ridiculous.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.000
Well, I'd date him. Hmm.

01:17.458 --> 01:18.917
Forget good looks.

01:18.917 --> 01:22.667
What goofy needs is cold, hard cash.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.333
But, Donald, we don't have any money.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.500
No, but my rich uncle does.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.792
Ah, so nice of you all to visit.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.542
Now, what can I do
for my favorite nephew?

01:35.917 --> 01:37.500
Goofy needs a million dollars.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.959
And if all else fails...

01:48.959 --> 01:51.000
Muscles!

01:51.000 --> 01:54.375
All right, goofy,
get ready to feel the burn.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.625
I don't see any muscles.

01:59.625 --> 02:02.000
Maybe we just need to
speed things up a bit.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.709
Mickey, were you playing
with my makeup again?

02:28.792 --> 02:29.792
Whoa!

02:37.333 --> 02:39.417
Aw, shucks, goof.
Sorry we didn't help.

02:39.417 --> 02:42.667
Didn't help? Why, y'all
taught me a powerful lesson.

02:42.667 --> 02:43.792
We did?

02:43.792 --> 02:46.041
You showed me that it's better to be me

02:46.041 --> 02:48.834
than to risk my life
trying to be someone else.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.792
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:50.792 --> 02:53.458
I've got a date with destiny.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.917
- Excuse me, miss?
- Goofy?

02:56.917 --> 03:03.208
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but I
just wanted to tell you that I love you.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.834
Oh, sugar.
You had me at "sorry."

03:09.375 --> 03:11.000
Not you.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.959
You!

03:15.542 --> 03:18.792
Oh, baby, I love you.
I hunger for you.

03:18.792 --> 03:21.750
He's in love with a sandwich?

03:22.458 --> 03:26.583
I now pronounce you husband and sandwich.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.166
You may kiss the bread.
