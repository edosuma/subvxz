WEBVTT

00:11.854 --> 00:14.948
Oh, he's so cute.

00:15.024 --> 00:17.356
He's in my third-period class.

00:17.426 --> 00:19.519
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

00:19.662 --> 00:22.654
What y'all staring at old Sunshine for?

00:22.731 --> 00:25.598
I'm the one dominating on the field.
He ain't played a minute all year.

00:25.668 --> 00:27.431
Who cares about the field?

00:27.503 --> 00:29.437
I don't want to be the one
to break your heart,

00:29.505 --> 00:31.268
but Sunshine's from California.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.274
Yeah, a California dreamboat.

00:33.342 --> 00:38.871
No, Sunshine is from California.
He's a California man.

00:38.948 --> 00:41.246
You talking to my girl?

00:41.317 --> 00:46.220
I don't see any livestock around here,
so I don't know what you talking about.

00:46.288 --> 00:48.017
Oh!

00:49.024 --> 00:50.753
<i>(girl) Rodney, stop it.
Leave him alone.</i>

00:50.826 --> 00:52.851
Get off me. Get off me.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.893
<i>(boy) You want some?</i>

00:56.966 --> 00:59.298
Break it up. Break it...

00:59.368 --> 01:01.461
Get your hands off me, man!

01:01.537 --> 01:04.631
- Hey, get off me!
- Julius, man.

01:04.706 --> 01:05.969
Chill!

01:06.041 --> 01:08.032
Petey, get these girls out of here!

01:08.544 --> 01:10.512
Get out of here.
Let's go, come on!

01:10.579 --> 01:12.410
- Uncle Tom traitor!
- Uncle Tom!

01:12.481 --> 01:16.144
I know you didn't call me no Uncle Tom.
Y'all better back off me now, man.

01:16.218 --> 01:17.651
Go! Move!

01:17.720 --> 01:20.621
Looks like you went to the zoo
and made some new friends, Bertier.

01:20.689 --> 01:24.455
Oh, big smart guy, huh?

01:35.037 --> 01:37.631
Marie's asked about Sheryl. Wanted
to know if she'd come spend the night.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.606
I told her I'd run it by you,
see what you thought.

01:39.675 --> 01:41.199
Yeah.

01:41.277 --> 01:44.440
She's over at the Boones' tonight.
I was gonna swing by on my way home

01:44.513 --> 01:45.502
and pick her up.

01:45.581 --> 01:48.015
Over at the Boones', huh?

01:48.083 --> 01:50.108
Yeah.

01:52.488 --> 01:56.254
So that's the way it is, huh?
Hey, you haven't changed a bit.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.817
You always wanna try and please
everybody, be the nice guy.

02:00.696 --> 02:04.097
Sooner or later, a man's got to pick sides.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.000
As for me, well, I'm not gonna put myself
through the rest of the season with that...

02:08.070 --> 02:13.906
Hey, I brought you here.
I want you with me.

02:13.976 --> 02:17.571
But you got to do what you got to do.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.746
That's all you can say to me
after all we've been through?

02:23.819 --> 02:25.787
- ''Do what you got to do''?
- Hey, Herb...

02:25.854 --> 02:28.516
You go to hell.

02:37.733 --> 02:40.759
That veer's getting better.
I'll admit that.

02:40.836 --> 02:43.862
- But you're still weak on the left side.
- We're not weak on the left side.

02:43.939 --> 02:46.373
We just got to work harder on the left side.
That's all.

02:46.442 --> 02:48.137
- That's not the problem.
- What is the problem?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.178
You think it is, but it ain't.
It's your pass reads.

02:50.245 --> 02:52.440
It's not... It's a run anyway.
It's not a pass.

02:52.514 --> 02:55.381
<i>- The veer is a run, not a pass.
- All right, you two. That's enough of that.</i>

02:55.451 --> 02:58.852
Sheryl, don't you want to play with Nicky?

02:59.621 --> 03:04.285
- I hate playing with dolls.
- I'm not playing. I'm accessorizing.

03:04.360 --> 03:10.094
Yeah, why don't you go accessorize?
Don't you want to go accessorize with...?

03:10.165 --> 03:12.861
<i>( man) Hey, Coach Coon!</i>

03:14.903 --> 03:17.565
In the back. In the back.

03:25.314 --> 03:27.805
<i>(tires screech)</i>

03:41.497 --> 03:44.057
Where's Coach, man?
What he want with us now?

03:44.133 --> 03:46.727
- Coaches ain't called this meeting tonight.
- We did.

03:47.069 --> 03:48.058
We outta here.

03:48.137 --> 03:49.934
Hey, how y'all gonna walk out
on your teammate like that?

03:50.005 --> 03:51.529
He say he got something to say,
y'all got to listen to him.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.838
Turn around! Turn around!
Where you going? Turn around!

03:54.910 --> 03:56.844
Coach Boone brought us this far, y'all,

03:56.912 --> 03:59.813
but he ain't gonna be there
for us forever, man.

03:59.882 --> 04:02.350
So what?
We won a few games.

04:02.418 --> 04:05.478
And y'all fools think that's something?

04:05.554 --> 04:08.887
Man, that ain't nothing, y'all!
And you know what else?

04:08.957 --> 04:14.156
We ain't nothing, either.
Yeah, we came together in camp. Cool.

04:14.229 --> 04:16.857
But then we're right back here
and the world tells us

04:16.932 --> 04:18.593
that they don't want us to be together.

04:18.666 --> 04:22.763
We fall apart like we ain't
a damn bit of nothing, man!

04:22.838 --> 04:27.537
And y'all think we done won something?
Man, we ain't won nothing, y'all.

04:27.609 --> 04:31.045
- Nothing!
- Rev, what's that you're always telling me

04:31.113 --> 04:34.776
when I get sick of trying to keep up
with my grades and stuff?

04:34.850 --> 04:40.254
<i>* Even youths grow tired and weary</i>

04:40.322 --> 04:42.882
<i>* Even young men stumble and fall</i>

04:42.958 --> 04:48.487
<i>* But those who trust in the Lord
will renew their strength</i>

04:48.564 --> 04:51.761
See, amen! Amen!
That's what I'm talking about.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.598
- Amen. Amen, right?
- That's right, Rev.

04:54.670 --> 04:58.333
<i>- Yeah! Yeah!
- * They will soar on wings like eagles</i>

04:58.407 --> 05:02.400
<i>* Oh, like eagles, y'all
like eagles, y'all</i>

05:02.478 --> 05:08.974
<i>- * They will walk and not grow faint
- Yeah! Can I get an amen!</i>

05:12.221 --> 05:15.213
Yeah! Yeah!

05:16.458 --> 05:20.224
We're playing Groveton Friday night, y'all!

05:20.295 --> 05:22.490
You all gonna play
like you ain't got no heart?

05:22.564 --> 05:25.124
- No!
- Do y'all want a victory?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.691
- Yeah!
- Do y'all want a victory?

05:27.769 --> 05:29.896
- Yeah!
- Turn in!

05:29.972 --> 05:32.133
<i>(chanting) Ooh, ooh, ooh...</i>

05:34.476 --> 05:36.341
Yeah!

05:37.513 --> 05:42.007
Like I said, we will not be intimidated.
We're gonna play football games.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.951
- Hatred, violence will not intimidate us!
- Coach! Coach!

05:45.020 --> 05:46.510
Is that why you need
the state troopers, Coach?

05:46.588 --> 05:49.386
Look, I don't need
no John Brown state troopers.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.255
You can tell whoever threw this brick
through my window,

05:51.326 --> 05:54.056
they can come visit me anytime!
I'll be at home.

05:54.129 --> 05:57.690
I think it's time you stopped antagonizing
everybody and learned a little humility.

05:57.766 --> 05:58.755
Humility, huh?

05:58.834 --> 06:02.930
If you could just keep your mouth shut
and didn't brag so much...

06:03.005 --> 06:05.633
Oh, I see. So you're blaming me
for what happened last night?

06:05.707 --> 06:08.267
No, I am talking
about setting a good example

06:08.343 --> 06:10.106
for our boys and for the community.

06:10.178 --> 06:12.112
I don't scratch my head unless it itches,

06:12.180 --> 06:15.274
and I don't dance unless I hear
some music. I will not be intimidated.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.339
That's just the way it is.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.410
If you wanna carry your sinful pride with
you to your grave, that's your business.

06:19.488 --> 06:23.481
But when your sins endanger
my little girl it becomes mine.

06:23.559 --> 06:25.459
My sins?

06:25.527 --> 06:29.054
You think my sins had something to do
with what happened last night?

06:29.131 --> 06:31.861
I'm sorry about what happened
to your daughter. I really am.

06:31.934 --> 06:36.769
But maybe you got a small taste
of what my girls go through. Hm?

06:36.838 --> 06:38.999
Welcome to my life, Yoast.

06:47.983 --> 06:51.544
- What's going on?
- Coach.

06:53.822 --> 06:57.758
We wanted to let you know we was gonna
warm up a little different tonight.

06:57.826 --> 07:00.056
<i>( announcer) This is the first
true test of the season</i>

07:00.128 --> 07:02.392
<i>for the undefeated
T. C. Williams Titans.</i>

07:02.631 --> 07:07.068
<i>'Cause tonight. they're going up
against the undefeated Groveton Lions.</i>

07:07.736 --> 07:13.072
<i>Their all-state noseguard Kip Tyler
is as mean as a copperhead snake.</i>

07:13.942 --> 07:17.002
<i>And here come the Titans!</i>

07:17.079 --> 07:23.040
<i>They're playing in front of a capacity
crowd for the first time this season.</i>

07:23.118 --> 07:24.244
<i>(chanting) Hoo-hah!
We're here!</i>

07:24.319 --> 07:26.378
Hoo-hah!
Feels good!

07:26.455 --> 07:27.979
Hoo-hah!
We're here!

07:28.056 --> 07:29.717
Hoo-hah!
Feels good!

07:29.791 --> 07:31.554
Hoo-hah!
We're here!

07:31.627 --> 07:33.151
Hoo-hah!
Feels good!

07:33.228 --> 07:35.093
Hoo-hah!
We're here!

07:35.163 --> 07:37.563
Hoo-hah!
Feels good!

07:39.968 --> 07:42.698
Julius Campbell's playing
strong-side linebacker.

07:42.771 --> 07:45.797
He's so good, he's got all-American
written all over him.

07:45.874 --> 07:48.172
- Sheryl!
- And Gerry Bertier...

07:48.243 --> 07:51.644
I do not care.

07:51.713 --> 07:55.740
Five! Six!
Five, six, seven, eight!

07:55.817 --> 07:59.583
<i>* Everywhere we go,

07:59.655 --> 08:03.421

<i>* Who we are,

08:07.763 --> 08:11.631
<i>* So we tell them,

<i>* Ooh, ah, oh, yeah</i>

08:23.512 --> 08:27.608
Who do they think they are,
The Beatles?

08:27.683 --> 08:30.277
All right, quit gawking!
Warm up!

08:30.719 --> 08:32.846
- Tyler.
- Coach?

08:32.921 --> 08:34.821
Shut 'em up. Hard.

08:39.494 --> 08:41.985
Ready!

08:42.063 --> 08:44.191
Omaha, Budds! Omaha!

08:44.265 --> 08:46.063
- Set!
- Omaha!

08:47.436 --> 08:48.994
Hike!

08:52.908 --> 08:54.899
Song's over, sambo!

09:09.024 --> 09:11.185
- What happened, Lastik?
- I audibled.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.022
Rev, I swear to God. I audibled.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.858
- I didn't hear it.
- All right, fellas, coming through.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.367
- Swear to God.
- Let's take a look at that, son.

09:19.434 --> 09:23.598
He broke a bone in the wrist. He won't
be throwing any more this season.

09:23.672 --> 09:28.200
- You got one minute, Coach.
- Take the other timeout, Coach.

09:29.578 --> 09:32.342
- Ronnie Bass!
- Coach, Rev's going back in, right?

09:32.414 --> 09:35.315
- Not at quarterback, son.
- I can't make that pitch, Coach.

09:35.383 --> 09:37.613
Yes, you can.

09:37.686 --> 09:42.123
When I was 15 years old, I lost my mother
and my father in the same month, Ronnie.

09:42.190 --> 09:45.455
The same month. 12 brothers and sisters.
I was the youngest one.

09:45.527 --> 09:49.361
But they were all looking up to me. I wasn't
ready yet, either. But they needed me.

09:49.431 --> 09:52.423
Your team needs you tonight.
You're the Colonel.

09:52.501 --> 09:54.298
You're gonna command your troops
tonight. You understand?

09:54.369 --> 09:59.068
- Yes, sir.
- Twins right, 48-0 read. Let's go.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.130
Let's go.

10:03.245 --> 10:06.271
What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen
a football injury before, you wimps?

10:06.348 --> 10:09.943
Let's go. Show some life in those legs.
I got it. It's gonna be all right.

10:10.018 --> 10:13.044
Budds, you release this time.
Louie, let him through, all right?

10:13.121 --> 10:15.885
- What?
- Just let him through. Trust me.

10:15.957 --> 10:19.484
- You had 12 brothers and sisters?
- Eight.

10:19.561 --> 10:20.892
Yeah.
12 sounds better.

10:24.866 --> 10:27.391
Ready!

10:27.469 --> 10:29.027
Set!

10:29.104 --> 10:31.334
Blue, 21 ! Blue, 21 !

10:31.406 --> 10:33.499
Hut!

10:39.548 --> 10:41.379
Whoo!

10:45.153 --> 10:47.621
Ref! Unnecessary roughness!
That's a penalty!

10:47.689 --> 10:49.850
On the quarterback?
Are you kidding me, Coach?

10:54.796 --> 10:59.631
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Did you see that, man?
That's a bad white boy, man.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.191
Hike!

11:06.541 --> 11:08.634
We've got ourselves a football player.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.699
Hut!

11:09.778 --> 11:15.011
<i>* Na na na na. hey. hey. hey
Goodbye</i>

11:15.083 --> 11:17.449
Hut!

11:17.519 --> 11:23.014
<i>* Na na na na. hey. hey. hey
Goodbye</i>

11:34.569 --> 11:37.663
All right, listen up, listen up, listen up.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.764
Listen up, listen up, listen up!

11:39.841 --> 11:42.139
Whoa.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.201
Game ball...

11:45.280 --> 11:47.874
...Ronnie Bass.

11:47.949 --> 11:49.382
Thank you.

11:49.451 --> 11:53.785
Hey, this ball right here... hey, this ball
right here goes to the real king right here.

11:53.855 --> 11:57.313
- Thanks for teaching me the veer, Rev.
- Aw, come on.

11:57.392 --> 12:02.261
<i>( all chant) Rev! Rev! Rev! Rev! Rev! Rev!
Rev! Rev! Rev! Rev!</i>

12:05.233 --> 12:09.567
Coach, can I speak with you in private?

12:09.638 --> 12:11.936
Sure.

12:13.108 --> 12:16.202
What's on your mind, son?

12:16.278 --> 12:20.112
I want Ray off the team, Coach.

12:20.181 --> 12:22.911
- You know my policy, Gerry.
- Yes, I do.

12:22.984 --> 12:28.820
And I respect it. But I know that Ray
missed that block on purpose.

12:28.890 --> 12:32.951
Sometimes you just got to cut a man loose.

12:33.028 --> 12:34.620
Mm.

12:34.696 --> 12:37.597
Well, you're the captain.

12:37.666 --> 12:41.932
You make a decision,
but you support your decision.

12:42.671 --> 12:45.003
We'll remember this one for a long time.

12:45.073 --> 12:48.531
Hey, guys, wait up.
I want to catch a ride with you.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.237
Ray?

12:53.848 --> 12:56.544
- You're out.
- What?

12:56.618 --> 13:00.520
I'm not gonna let you play
for this team anymore.

13:01.957 --> 13:04.619
Oh, yeah, Jerry Lewis?

13:04.693 --> 13:09.027
Gonna go and tell Coach Coon
what to do, just like last time?

13:09.097 --> 13:13.966
But then that's right -

the Titans are having, Coach.

a holding penalty on me every time.

29:56.537 --> 29:59.301
I should have been there with you.

29:59.373 --> 30:02.399
What are you talking about?

30:02.476 --> 30:06.105
You would've been in the bed
right next to me.

30:06.180 --> 30:10.116
You can't be hurt like this.

30:10.184 --> 30:13.119
You...
You're Superman.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.962
I was afraid of you, Julius.

30:25.232 --> 30:28.429
I only saw what I was afraid of.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.897
And now I know
I was only hating my brother.

30:34.675 --> 30:36.870
I'll tell you what, though.

30:36.944 --> 30:41.142
Um, when all this is over,

30:41.215 --> 30:44.480
me and you are gonna move out
to the same neighborhood together.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.143
OK?

30:47.154 --> 30:51.181
And we'll get old and we'll get fat.

30:51.258 --> 30:55.092
<i>And there ain't gonna be
all this black/white between us.</i>

31:01.335 --> 31:03.394
Left side.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.496
Strong side.

31:14.248 --> 31:17.649
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:17.718 --> 31:21.745
- Uh, the Marshall film.
- Well, that's good.

31:21.822 --> 31:24.518
We're gonna have to be real sharp

31:24.591 --> 31:28.118
on the offensive and defensive sides
of the football.

31:28.195 --> 31:30.459
Figure we give the kids
a couple of extra practices this week,

31:30.531 --> 31:33.728
make sure they stay focused.

31:33.801 --> 31:37.794
- Got a press conference today at 12...
- Press conference?

31:37.871 --> 31:40.965
Listen, what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing.

31:41.041 --> 31:43.305
But we are not gonna parade around...

31:43.377 --> 31:45.937
Hold on, hold on.
I'm not talking about parading.

31:46.013 --> 31:50.279
I'm talking about going out there,
presenting a strong, united front.

31:50.350 --> 31:54.286
Now, I'm hurting...
just like you are, Yoast.

31:54.354 --> 31:57.152
But the season is not over yet.

31:57.658 --> 32:02.357
I didn't... We did not come this far
to just break down and lose now.

32:02.429 --> 32:06.559
Everything's not always
about winning and losing.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.329
I'm a winner.

32:09.403 --> 32:11.394
I'm going to win.

32:11.472 --> 32:17.104
Is this even about football anymore?
Or is it just about you?

32:18.178 --> 32:22.376
<i>( reporter) Coach Boone.
Coach, you lost Bertier.</i>

32:22.449 --> 32:24.041
Is your defense in trouble?

32:24.118 --> 32:28.885
You cannot replace a Gerry Bertier...

32:28.956 --> 32:32.517
...as a player or person.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.897
I don't know, Mama.

32:43.070 --> 32:45.800
Maybe Yoast was right.
Maybe I pushed 'em too hard.

32:45.873 --> 32:48.364
Gerry had an accident.

32:50.144 --> 32:55.081
Sometimes life's just hard.
For no reason at all.

32:55.149 --> 32:57.777
You think I was blinded
by my own ambition?

32:57.851 --> 33:00.615
Mm.

33:00.687 --> 33:06.125
Whatever kind of ambition it took
to do what you did around here,

33:06.193 --> 33:09.720
this world could use
a lot more of it, Herman.

33:20.674 --> 33:24.075
- Hey, Coach.
- How ya doing?

33:30.450 --> 33:32.145
This for me?

33:33.487 --> 33:37.446
I want you to be my eyes
out there, all right?

33:37.524 --> 33:40.823
Any of these guys slack off,
you just let me know.

33:41.528 --> 33:44.190
You bet I will.

33:45.532 --> 33:48.592
- How ya doing, Gerry?
- I'm all right, Coach.

33:48.669 --> 33:50.728
I was talking with these guys
about Marshall, trying...

33:50.804 --> 33:53.568
You know what? We don't need
to talk about football right now, Gerry.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.167
I think this is a good time
for reflection and for prayer.

33:57.244 --> 34:00.680
Coach? I'm hurt.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.238
I ain't dead.

34:03.317 --> 34:06.616
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

34:08.188 --> 34:12.090
You know, I've been reading up
on the activities that they got

34:12.159 --> 34:14.992

34:15.661 --> 34:17.891

Well, I'm glad to hear that, son,
but I'm already married.

Coach, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

35:11.418 --> 35:13.784
You abandoned your team
in their moment of need, Petey.

35:13.854 --> 35:16.220
- Sorry won't make up for that.
- Yeah, I know, but listen,

35:16.290 --> 35:19.748
I want to play for you.
I want to play for the championship.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.989
You can play for me next year.
You sit on that bench.

35:23.063 --> 35:25.054
Show me you can support
your teammates.

Excuse me, young lady.
You can't be here right now.

Just give him a little cushion.
Just give him a little cushion.

38:19.306 --> 38:20.933
And when they throw that ball,
you stick him!

38:21.007 --> 38:23.032

He's a mile ahead of you, Coach.

we'd get the ball a little more.

Sweetheart, you better
get back to your seat.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.465
- I can't, Coach.
- What?

39:22.536 --> 39:24.663
Ed Henry's got Boone's number,
sure as shooting.

39:24.738 --> 39:28.765
And you ain't doing nothing
against that shotgun.

39:28.842 --> 39:32.107
Look, Coach, now ain't the time
to be proud.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.706
All right, we're in a fight.

39:35.916 --> 39:41.354
You boys are doing all that you can do.
Anybody can see that.

39:41.421 --> 39:44.652
Win or lose,

39:44.724 --> 39:50.356
we're gonna walk out of this stadium
tonight with our heads held high.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.922
Do your best.
That's all anybody can ask for.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.834
No, it ain't, Coach.
With all due respect,

39:57.904 --> 40:01.670
you demanded more of us.
You demanded perfection.

40:01.741 --> 40:05.438
Now, I ain't saying that I'm perfect,
'cause I'm not.

40:05.512 --> 40:08.174
And I ain't gonna never be.
None of us are.

40:08.248 --> 40:12.275
But we have won every single game
we have played till now.

40:12.352 --> 40:15.685
So this team is perfect.

40:15.755 --> 40:18.986
We stepped out on that field
that way tonight.

40:19.059 --> 40:22.051
And if it's all the same to you,
Coach Boone,

40:22.128 --> 40:24.187
that's how we want to leave it.

40:24.264 --> 40:25.561
Yeah.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.658
I hope you boys have learned
as much from me this year

40:28.735 --> 40:30.965
as I've learned from you.

40:31.037 --> 40:36.168
You've taught this city how to trust the soul
of a man rather than the look of him.

40:36.242 --> 40:39.507
And I guess it's about time
I joined the club.

40:39.579 --> 40:44.642
Herman, I sure could use your help.
Ed Henry's kicking my ass out there.

40:44.818 --> 40:47.286
Listen up.
This is our time now.

40:47.354 --> 40:50.721
Second half is our time! We're gonna
make some changes on defense.

40:50.790 --> 40:55.056
They're spreading us out too far.
We're gonna put Sunshine, Alan,

40:55.128 --> 40:59.394
Glascoe, Davis, you're gonna play
both ways, rest of the game.

40:59.466 --> 41:02.435
I don't want a receiver to get across
that line of scrimmage.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.834
Coach Yoast will tell you
where you're playing, all right?

41:04.904 --> 41:08.499

- Sir, I can play with Roosevelt.

41:21.521 --> 41:25.252
But I cannot play with these guys.

41:25.325 --> 41:26.986
No, I tell you what.
I didn't warm the bench all year

41:27.060 --> 41:32.999
so I could watch us go down
on my account. Put Petey in. He's better.

41:33.066 --> 41:38.003
