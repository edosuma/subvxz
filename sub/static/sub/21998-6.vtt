00:01.211 --> 00:04.351
We lost the third baby, Jack.
I'm-I'm very sorry.

00:04.719 --> 00:06.286
Previously on This Is Us...

00:06.321 --> 00:08.922
He pushed... a stranger on me.

00:09.352 --> 00:11.796
And that stranger became my child.

00:12.197 --> 00:14.820
And that child became my life.

00:14.845 --> 00:16.178
He became you.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.343
Eight years ago, I was pregnant
for the first time,

00:19.368 --> 00:22.029
and Randall was vying
for partner at his firm.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.165
And he made sure I didn't lift a finger.

00:24.199 --> 00:26.300
And then, one morning,
I was in the bathroom,

00:26.334 --> 00:28.669
and he... called out to me.

00:29.132 --> 00:30.971
He was confused, because he...

00:31.671 --> 00:33.398
couldn't see anything.

00:33.712 --> 00:35.492
No, the kids are gonna be fine.

00:35.964 --> 00:37.431
We're their parents, Bec.

00:38.164 --> 00:39.357
We do the best we can.

00:39.382 --> 00:40.982
But at the end of the day...
what happens

00:41.016 --> 00:42.683
to them, how they turn out...

00:42.990 --> 00:44.367
that's bigger than us.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.696
Jimmy said that his mom's handing out

01:03.721 --> 01:05.465
pennies this year, so
tomorrow we'll skip them

01:05.489 --> 01:06.610
and go straight to the Baileys.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.070
They have full-size candy bars.

01:08.095 --> 01:09.468
Okay, Mr. King of Pop.

01:09.493 --> 01:12.023
- Can you try this on for me, please?
- Thank you.

01:12.127 --> 01:14.974
We don't need a map.
We're not gonna get lost

01:14.999 --> 01:16.687
trick-or-treating in
our own neighborhood.

01:16.712 --> 01:18.835
It's not about getting lost,
it's about maximizing

01:18.870 --> 01:20.578
our house-to-candy ratio.

01:21.859 --> 01:23.017
- Mom.
- You know what?

01:23.041 --> 01:25.075
If he wants to use a
map, he can use a map.

01:25.108 --> 01:26.887
- Hey, Bug, here you go.
- What are you doing?

01:26.911 --> 01:28.672
- Try that on, please.
- Stop. You can't draw on it.

01:28.696 --> 01:30.032
And then, here is your stethoscope,

01:30.056 --> 01:32.015
'cause I think vets
use stethoscopes, right?

01:32.040 --> 01:34.341
- I don't want to be a vet anymore.
- What?

01:34.456 --> 01:36.490
- Why not?
- It's not pretty.

01:36.609 --> 01:38.477
- I...
- Hey, hey, sorry I'm late.

01:38.511 --> 01:40.101
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:40.126 --> 01:43.764
Who wants to carve some pumpkin corpses?

01:43.789 --> 01:45.789
Mwah.

01:45.835 --> 01:47.052
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

01:47.087 --> 01:48.053
Do I have to be a vet?

01:48.088 --> 01:49.555
I want to be Sandy from Grease.

01:49.589 --> 01:51.343
- Pretty Sandy, not tough Sandy.
- Okay.

01:51.368 --> 01:53.390
Yeah, you can be pretty Sandy.
Mom can handle that, right?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.070
Jack, I just finished her costume.

01:55.095 --> 01:57.046
- Well, I...
- I can use my yellow sweater.

01:57.071 --> 02:00.173
Hey. She can, she can
use her yellow sweater.

02:00.198 --> 02:01.468
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:02.242 --> 02:05.244
Oh, and Kevin's doing
his cigar-smoking bum again.

02:05.279 --> 02:06.589
Oh, yeah. That's his ultimate fantasy,

02:06.613 --> 02:08.609
no chores and nothing tucked in. Jack...

02:08.633 --> 02:10.026
Oh, hey, Randall... yeah?
Check this out.

02:10.050 --> 02:11.969
I've been working on something for you.
Ready? Here.

02:11.993 --> 02:14.703
Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Whoo-hoo! Ooh!

02:14.728 --> 02:17.435
- -Really, Dad?
- Okay. Yes, really.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.636
I'm gonna go change, and then
we're gonna carve some pumpkins,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.656
okay? Get 'em ready. Line 'em up.

02:22.951 --> 02:24.051
- Hey.
- Huh?

02:24.076 --> 02:25.543
Jack. You...

02:25.666 --> 02:27.781
You have to stop doing that, with Kate.

02:27.806 --> 02:28.906
Doing what?

02:29.636 --> 02:31.604
Saying yes to anything that she wants.

02:31.638 --> 02:33.757
- Oh, come on. No, I don't.
- You do.

02:33.782 --> 02:35.750
- It was a costume, Bec.
- Jack.

02:35.797 --> 02:38.154
What-Whatever-whatever
makes the kid happy.

02:38.179 --> 02:41.271
You cannot bear to see her
disappointed, can you?

02:43.586 --> 02:44.937
- What was that?
- Nothing.

02:44.962 --> 02:47.303
No, you made a...
You made some sort of sound.

02:47.328 --> 02:49.001
I just don't know
what that's supposed to mean.

02:49.025 --> 02:50.023
I just...

02:50.048 --> 02:53.093
I find it funny that you're accusing me

02:53.118 --> 02:54.375
of being too easy on Kate

02:54.400 --> 02:56.901
when you treat Randall
like a glass figurine.

02:57.695 --> 02:59.007
Uh, I do not.

02:59.032 --> 03:00.232
- Okay.
- No...

03:00.257 --> 03:01.804
Mm. No, we're not...

03:01.829 --> 03:03.829
I'm not letting you reroute
the conversation, Jack.

03:03.921 --> 03:06.671
You realize, that by saying yes
to everything that Kate wants,

03:06.696 --> 03:08.726
it's not preparing her
for the real world.

03:08.751 --> 03:11.484
- Okay.
- No, no. High school and college

03:11.509 --> 03:14.978
and her 20s? Oh, my God, her 20s
are gonna be nothing but noes.

03:15.003 --> 03:18.772
Hang on. Didn't I say
yes to you in your 20s?

03:20.586 --> 03:23.354
- Wait, you said yes to me in my 20s?
- Yeah. Sure did.

03:23.388 --> 03:24.899
- Are you kidding me right now?
- No, I...

03:24.923 --> 03:26.591
- Yeah.
- No way.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.452
I don't think you're
remembering your 20s.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.560
Oh, I remember my 20s.

03:29.595 --> 03:30.638
- You clearly don't, Jack.
- No.

03:30.662 --> 03:31.859
I remember my 20s.

03:31.884 --> 03:33.437
- Yeah?
- Did a lot of this.

03:33.565 --> 03:34.648
Uh-huh.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.703
- All that, oh, my gosh.
- I do remember that.

03:36.728 --> 03:38.473
There was so much of that
going on in our 20s.

03:38.497 --> 03:40.031
People don't forget their 20s.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.375
No, I got it.

03:52.450 --> 03:53.500
Uh-huh.

03:53.754 --> 03:55.062
Flight 235.

03:56.343 --> 03:58.117
Okay, he'll be in baggage claim.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.250
Yeah.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.609
Okay, Rebecca.

04:01.882 --> 04:03.546
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

04:03.768 --> 04:05.202
Oh, and thank you.

04:05.597 --> 04:07.464
I'm so glad you're gonna be here.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.726
Yeah, my mom is coming as soon
as she gets over the flu.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.984
It's been a rough couple months.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.984
Um...

04:16.425 --> 04:18.117
Better, I think.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.101
You'll see when you get here.

04:21.683 --> 04:23.015
Yeah. Okay.

04:23.761 --> 04:25.765
All right. Bye.

04:39.098 --> 04:40.555
Okay, did you need anything else, or...?

04:40.579 --> 04:41.656
- No.
- Uh... okay.

04:41.681 --> 04:42.718
Just the check, please.

04:42.743 --> 04:44.226
Your favorite customer is here.

04:48.351 --> 04:50.101
Hey. Can I get you some coffee?

04:50.361 --> 04:51.679
Uh, yeah, if it's hot.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, it was, it was just brewed.

04:57.055 --> 04:58.616
- How's the pressure?
- Hmm?

04:58.641 --> 04:59.941
Too hard, too soft?

04:59.976 --> 05:01.676
- No, you can go harder.
- Yeah?

05:01.711 --> 05:03.953
Mm-hmm. You got a future here, Kevin.

05:04.164 --> 05:05.812
You're gonna be cutting hair in no time.

05:05.837 --> 05:07.504
Nah. Nah, nah, nah.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.797
I'm just, uh, here till
pilot season starts.

05:09.822 --> 05:11.203
- Mm.
- Yeah.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.188
I-I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,

05:13.212 --> 05:14.846
"That's what he said last year," right?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.437
About, you know, only being here
till pilot season starts.

05:23.088 --> 05:25.929
Okay. Fifth time's the charm.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.015
Here you go...

05:33.632 --> 05:35.199
Come on, man.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.484
Come on, damn it.

05:37.301 --> 05:39.453
Nope. Not gonna get me.

05:40.443 --> 05:41.484
Round six.

05:41.828 --> 05:42.929
Here we go.

05:45.722 --> 05:48.890
So, you're early, but it's
Friday, so, uh, tuna melt?

05:49.284 --> 05:50.960
Extra onions, well-done fries?

05:50.985 --> 05:52.601
You know me too well.

05:53.609 --> 05:54.609
Stay.

05:54.693 --> 05:55.759
Talk a while.

05:56.889 --> 05:57.906
Okay.

05:59.188 --> 06:00.321
So, what's new?

06:00.659 --> 06:02.459
You trick-or-treating tonight, or...?

06:02.484 --> 06:05.664
No. No, I'll be at the, uh,
the South Hills Lounge,

06:05.689 --> 06:07.171
buying my guys some drinks.

06:07.389 --> 06:09.007
What about you? Party on campus?

06:09.295 --> 06:10.595
Uh, it's night school.

06:10.841 --> 06:13.429
So, there'... there's no parties

06:13.549 --> 06:15.398
or a campus.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.149
'Cause everyone's like,

06:17.173 --> 06:19.718
"Hey, anyone ever tell you
you look like Tom Cruise?" or,

06:19.743 --> 06:21.875
"Hey, you're like a young Tom Cruise."

06:22.520 --> 06:24.866
"Oh, you're like a, you're like
a young Tom Cruise, but tall."

06:24.890 --> 06:26.869
You know what I mean? And then,
all of a sudden, everything

06:26.893 --> 06:28.633
slows down, right? Because
they're like, "Well,

06:28.657 --> 06:30.593
I don't know.
He's a little too Tom Cruise."

06:30.651 --> 06:32.531
Or, "He's like Tom Cruise,
but he's too tall."

06:32.555 --> 06:35.187
And I'm like "Guys, hello!
I can act shorter.

06:35.278 --> 06:37.356
- But no one's got an imagination...
- Kevin.

06:37.599 --> 06:39.492
- Too much pressure?
- Too much whining.

06:39.921 --> 06:40.921
Okay. Sorry.

06:41.393 --> 06:42.994
I broke the damn fan.

06:43.715 --> 06:45.976
Oh. Baby, it's October.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.757
We don't need a ceiling
fan in the nursery.

06:48.782 --> 06:50.734
No, no, we need air circulation, Beth.

06:50.992 --> 06:52.437
That's what they say crib death is,

06:52.462 --> 06:54.352
you know, little pockets of
trapped air that get stuck

06:54.376 --> 06:55.657
in the baby's throat, and they
wake up in the night and...

06:55.681 --> 06:57.742
You know what we don't
need to talk about right now?

06:58.628 --> 06:59.718
Crib death.

07:00.390 --> 07:02.391
It's in none of the books
under suggested topics

07:02.416 --> 07:04.585
for the day before delivery.

07:06.873 --> 07:07.921
You're right.

07:08.234 --> 07:09.648
- Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.664
Hey. Did you eat anything today? Hmm?

07:13.482 --> 07:16.492
You know what the doctor said
about blood sugar levels and mood...

07:16.743 --> 07:17.765
Okay.

07:19.017 --> 07:20.539
These are fun-size, Beth.

07:21.001 --> 07:23.002
I wanted to be the house
with the full-size candy.

07:23.162 --> 07:25.335
And the wife who's not worried
about her husband.

07:25.483 --> 07:27.156
I'm not worried about you, baby.

07:27.376 --> 07:30.111
You know, it was two months ago, okay?

07:30.326 --> 07:32.156
You're good. We're good.

07:34.766 --> 07:37.945
You know what, I just got to get
this fan thing off my mind. Sorry.

07:43.089 --> 07:44.882
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.164
Hmm?

07:46.476 --> 07:47.695
He's gonna come through.

07:49.418 --> 07:50.656
He always comes through.

Ta-da!

08:04.779 --> 08:05.787
I don't get it.

08:05.812 --> 08:08.294
What?! We're Sonny and Cher.

08:08.601 --> 08:09.599
Who are they?

08:09.624 --> 08:11.158
You don't know who Sonny...?

08:11.666 --> 08:13.021
♪ I got you, babe ♪

08:13.202 --> 08:15.814
- ♪ Hey, I got you. ♪
- Oof.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.552
No, that was Cher 'cause
I think you sound great.

08:18.577 --> 08:20.225
Great, it sounded like Rebecca.
Okay, guys, let's go.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.560
This is stupid.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.599
I don't want to use Randall's weird map.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.740
I want to go to the Johnsons'
haunted house first.

08:25.765 --> 08:28.600
No, we have to use my map
to get to the good candy first,

08:28.625 --> 08:30.154
then we go to the haunted house.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.107
Okay, so how about we vote?

08:32.131 --> 08:33.522
- Map or haunted house?
- No, no, no, no.

08:33.546 --> 08:34.607
- Haunted house!
- No map!

08:34.631 --> 08:36.732
No fair! Mom promised.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.599
Aw, don't be a baby. We voted.

08:38.624 --> 08:40.035
- No!
- Kev...

08:40.061 --> 08:41.469
We'll spend too much
time in the haunted house.

08:41.493 --> 08:43.552
I planned everything so perfectly!

08:43.577 --> 08:46.552
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Randall, it's fine.

08:46.577 --> 08:47.777
It's fine, okay?

08:47.802 --> 08:48.836
We'll use the map.

08:49.222 --> 08:50.982
- I did promise him, Jack.
- Okay.

08:51.284 --> 08:54.019
Why don't you take them
and I'll take him?

08:54.202 --> 08:56.091
And we'll be done by...

08:56.246 --> 08:58.482
Look, 8:07, Eastern Standard Time, okay?

08:58.507 --> 09:00.224
And then we'll meet
back up with you guys.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.952
Yep. Great. Okay. Uh, guys,
get your pillow cases.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.600
Go. Come on. Randall,
get your pillow case.

09:03.624 --> 09:04.771
Okay. Go, go, go.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.380
This is exactly what I was
talking about earlier.

09:06.404 --> 09:07.005
Jack...

09:07.030 --> 09:08.727
No. He's too rigid and
it's getting worse.

09:08.752 --> 09:11.153
No, no. He's not rigid. He's anxious.

09:11.178 --> 09:13.084
Mom, come on, come on, come on.
We're late.

09:13.478 --> 09:15.069
- Look, Jack, I did promise him.
- Yeah. Go.

09:15.093 --> 09:16.818
Okay, uh, 8:07.
I'll be the one with the wig

09:16.843 --> 09:18.521
- and the devoted fan base, okay?
- Mom, come on.

09:18.545 --> 09:20.030
- I'm coming!
- Wait, wait a minute.

09:20.054 --> 09:22.732
With-Without you, I...
What is my costume?

09:23.294 --> 09:25.193
Great. So, I-I'm Rhoda.

09:25.218 --> 09:26.896
I'm Rhoda with a mustache.

09:26.921 --> 09:29.060
- Come on, Dad, haunted house!
- Yep. Haunted house!

09:29.116 --> 09:30.779
Haunted house! Here we go.

09:58.027 --> 09:59.146
Perfect.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.037
- Dude!
- Hey.

10:02.062 --> 10:05.298
Dude, I booked a new
Christian Bale movie.

10:07.763 --> 10:09.127
- What?!
- Yeah.

10:10.052 --> 10:12.489
How did the... Wow.
That's... congratulations.

10:12.514 --> 10:14.648
You know, that's-that's-that's just...
good for you.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.248
No, it's good for both of us, dude.

10:16.273 --> 10:18.647
Don't even worry about paying me
back for rent last month, okay?

10:18.671 --> 10:21.982
Because this is all thanks to
you for encouraging me and all.

10:22.007 --> 10:24.365
Yeah, well, you know, I mean,
I say nice things to you,

10:24.390 --> 10:26.428
you say them back to me.
That's the arrangement, right?

10:26.452 --> 10:30.529
Yes. So, Brett, the director,
invited me to a private party

10:30.554 --> 10:32.912
with the cast tonight
and you got to come with.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.431
Oh, no, dude,
that's your fast lane now, man.

10:35.456 --> 10:37.678
- That's-that's your thing, I'm...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:37.702 --> 10:39.505
Come on, you are so talented.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.497
This is gonna happen for you. It is.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.341
You just need some introductions, okay?

10:47.357 --> 10:48.318
Please.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.686
You know what, the hell with it.
Let's go.

10:49.710 --> 10:50.748
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.318
Home, baby.

10:52.428 --> 10:53.451
Hey.

10:53.555 --> 10:55.435
Hi, Rebecca!

10:55.460 --> 10:57.461
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, there she is.

10:57.486 --> 10:59.957
Oh, it's good to see
you, too, sweetheart.

10:59.982 --> 11:02.029
Oh, how are you?

11:02.054 --> 11:03.460
- I'm hanging in there.
- Yeah?

11:03.484 --> 11:05.384
Oh, you look wonderful.

11:05.409 --> 11:07.732
Oh, thank you.
You're a good liar.

11:07.757 --> 11:09.763
Ah, not lying.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.177
Hey, babe, why don't you
take her luggage up?

11:12.207 --> 11:14.375
- On it.
- Thank you.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.677
You're welcome, Ma.

11:18.827 --> 11:20.227
- He looks good.
- Yeah? Really?

11:20.252 --> 11:21.951
- You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

11:21.976 --> 11:24.130
I... I think he looks a little tired,

11:24.155 --> 11:26.591
but that's to be expected, right?

11:26.713 --> 11:28.347
- I'm really glad you're here.
- Me, too.

11:28.623 --> 11:30.391
It's been stressful with the baby due

11:30.416 --> 11:32.435
- and-and, just in case...
- I know.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.724
Yeah, I know. I know, I know.
Well, I'm glad to be here.

11:35.749 --> 11:37.146
- Oh, my gosh, babe.
- Ah!

11:37.171 --> 11:39.106
- Hey.
- I was just telling your mom

11:39.131 --> 11:40.865
how I haven't seen my
feet in months. Yeah.

11:40.890 --> 11:43.638
You know, you two are
really loud whisperers.

11:45.324 --> 11:47.013
You haven't quite got that down yet.

11:48.706 --> 11:50.896
So, I'll tell you what.
Uh, I'm gonna leave.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.296
I'm gonna take that fan back
and get a new one,

11:53.320 --> 11:55.685
and you guys can talk about me
as loud as you want,

11:55.710 --> 11:58.232
but when I come back...

11:59.151 --> 12:00.498
...let's be normal.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.005
All right?

12:03.660 --> 12:04.959
- Baby.
- Hmm?

12:04.984 --> 12:07.982
It's Halloween and it's
getting dark. You really want...

12:08.007 --> 12:09.764
I can drive three miles
to the hardware store, Beth.

12:09.788 --> 12:12.056
Oh. Yeah. Of course. Here.

12:12.479 --> 12:14.529
- Let me move my stuff for you.
- Uh-huh.

12:14.645 --> 12:18.130
Look, that way this fan thing
won't be hanging over my head.

12:19.182 --> 12:20.582
Or it will be hanging over my head.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.623
See what I did there? Fan joke.

12:24.607 --> 12:25.755
I'm gonna go.

12:30.567 --> 12:33.998
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

12:37.061 --> 12:39.062
It's too crowded.
Let's come back later.

12:39.097 --> 12:40.364
No, he said he'd be here.

12:40.398 --> 12:42.209
Do you see any Ninja Turtles?

12:42.667 --> 12:44.101
Wha... Wh-What do you mean, who?

12:44.135 --> 12:45.349
- Who's he?
- Billy.

12:45.983 --> 12:47.888
- Who's Billy?
- There's one!

12:49.301 --> 12:51.248
Kev, wh-what's going on right now?

12:52.107 --> 12:53.513
She's gonna ask Billy Palmer

12:53.538 --> 12:55.263
to go through
the haunted house with her,

12:55.288 --> 12:57.404
and if it gets scary,
he might hold her hand.

12:58.051 --> 12:59.287
She has a crush on him.

12:59.481 --> 13:01.021
Come on, that's ridiculous. She's ten.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.294
It's ridiculous
because he's Billy Palmer.

13:03.654 --> 13:05.449
He's almost as popular as me,

13:05.474 --> 13:07.630
and no way is he gonna hold her hand.

13:08.474 --> 13:10.794
Can I just go trick-or-treating
on my own now?

13:11.138 --> 13:12.576
Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

13:12.601 --> 13:14.419
Just, hey, houses I can see, Kev,

13:14.444 --> 13:16.404
- and then you come right back.
- Okay!

13:40.004 --> 13:41.052
Hi.

13:42.008 --> 13:43.857
Uh, they canceled class tonight,

13:43.882 --> 13:46.709
so I thought I would take
my new costume for a spin.

13:46.881 --> 13:50.084
It's "Nervous Girl Taking a Chance."

13:52.886 --> 13:54.013
Well, I'm glad you're here.

13:54.038 --> 13:55.529
- You are?
- I am.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.051
Can't you tell from my costume?

13:57.172 --> 13:59.044
"Guy Who's Happy to See You."

14:00.702 --> 14:03.373
I was hoping it was
"Guy Who Buys Me a Drink."

14:08.491 --> 14:10.935
Uh, I was actually leaving, so...

14:11.287 --> 14:14.560
Oh. Yeah, that-that... cool.

14:14.585 --> 14:16.185
Can we go someplace quieter?

14:18.669 --> 14:19.990
Yeah, I live nearby.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.084
Oh, okay. Look.

14:28.066 --> 14:31.115
- There he is. There he is.
- Oh, yeah. Look at that.

14:31.615 --> 14:32.419
You know what I love?

14:32.444 --> 14:33.827
I love how everyone's just
all of the sudden decided

14:33.851 --> 14:35.584
- that he's the man, you know?
- Yeah.

14:35.768 --> 14:36.866
He's, like, barely done anything.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.090
Yeah. Totally.

14:38.893 --> 14:39.740
You want to meet him?

14:39.765 --> 14:41.255
- Hell yeah. Huge fan.
- Yeah.

14:41.407 --> 14:43.541
- Brett.
- Oh, there he is.

14:43.865 --> 14:45.802
- Here's our Jason.
- How are you?

14:45.827 --> 14:46.771
Hey, man.

14:46.796 --> 14:48.755
Hey, this is my friend, Kevin Pearson.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.435
- He's an actor, too.
- Hey. How are you?

14:50.460 --> 14:52.030
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
You know what I loved...

14:52.054 --> 14:54.654
Hey, man, you killed it
today. Come on.

14:54.679 --> 14:56.014
- Laura wants to talk to you.
- Oh.

14:56.038 --> 14:57.974
- She thought you were great.
- Oh. Oh, my God.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.107
Great.

15:01.247 --> 15:02.654
We've changed, you know?

15:03.602 --> 15:06.691
- We're so polite.
- Hmm.

15:06.716 --> 15:09.233
We tiptoe around each
other like strangers.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.606
And it's hard for me
to tiptoe right now.

15:12.187 --> 15:13.325
Then don't.

15:13.995 --> 15:15.567
He's a lot stronger than he seems.

15:15.592 --> 15:17.255
You didn't see him.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.950
You did not see him
that morning, Rebecca.

15:21.105 --> 15:25.684
Just blind and weeping
and a million miles away.

15:25.709 --> 15:26.709
Hmm.

15:28.279 --> 15:29.755
And has it happened since?

15:29.984 --> 15:31.872
No, not so far.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.145
He says it's fine, but I just...

15:36.567 --> 15:38.137
I don't believe him anymore.

15:39.319 --> 15:40.426
You should.

15:41.485 --> 15:42.880
You know Randall.

15:42.905 --> 15:44.325
When he gets knocked down,

15:44.350 --> 15:46.114
- he gets right back...
- You weren't there.

15:47.558 --> 15:48.583
You're right.

15:49.173 --> 15:50.941
You're right, I-I wasn't there.

15:54.783 --> 15:56.294
You know, my friends are telling me

15:56.319 --> 15:58.187
that I need to join something
called Facebook?

15:58.212 --> 16:02.091
To see, uh, all the-the baby
pictures you're gonna post.

16:02.116 --> 16:03.489
Oh, no, don't even bother.

16:03.514 --> 16:05.653
I'm not gonna be one of those
moms who posts a picture

16:05.678 --> 16:07.473
every time a baby burps, okay?

16:07.498 --> 16:10.395
They say that it's-it's
a good way to-to, um,

16:10.420 --> 16:14.723
stay connected and feel part
of a community. I don't know.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.598
I could help you set it up.

16:18.905 --> 16:20.403
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

16:21.422 --> 16:24.278
Yeah, okay, I would like that.
I'll try it.

16:24.303 --> 16:25.341
Cool.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.341
- Hey, sweetheart?
- Hmm?

16:32.401 --> 16:34.602
You're gonna believe him again.

16:39.319 --> 16:40.395
7:45.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.700
- Right on schedule.
- Yeah! That's great.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.091
Hey, hey, hey, but let's,

16:44.116 --> 16:46.076
uh, let's go to to this house.
That's the Larsens.

16:46.224 --> 16:47.497
Nah, they talk too much

16:47.611 --> 16:49.528
and they make you do tricks,
like hopscotch.

16:49.553 --> 16:51.684
Yeah, but it's gonna be really quick

16:51.709 --> 16:53.732
because there's no one waiting
in line over there, so let's go.

16:53.756 --> 16:56.551
Mom, it's because they always
have licorice and-and...

16:57.441 --> 17:00.110
Let's just stay on my map, okay?

17:00.214 --> 17:01.450
Hey, hey, Randall.

17:01.844 --> 17:03.958
The plan is not set in stone.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.800
We can change it. We can...

17:06.577 --> 17:07.877
we can improvise.

17:08.053 --> 17:09.942
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

17:10.307 --> 17:12.541
It means when you make
something up in the moment

17:12.567 --> 17:14.270
and it can be a lot of fun.

17:14.295 --> 17:15.403
Can you try it for me?

17:15.839 --> 17:17.356
Just take one minute.

17:19.503 --> 17:20.700
Fine!

17:22.574 --> 17:23.692
Okay.

17:34.466 --> 17:35.622
Can I help you, sir?

17:37.059 --> 17:38.083
What?

17:38.448 --> 17:40.137
Oh, yeah. Um...

17:41.195 --> 17:42.387
I need, uh...

17:44.801 --> 17:47.505
Sorry, uh, this doesn't work.

17:47.843 --> 17:49.310
I can get you a new one.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.966
It's for the baby.
I got a baby coming tomorrow.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.833
Oh, congratulations.

17:55.496 --> 17:58.137
Uh, okay, well, let me just see which...

17:58.162 --> 17:59.762
I had a breakdown
a couple of months ago.

18:01.806 --> 18:04.278
You know, nervous, mental,
whatever you want to call it.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.692
And I'm not the same, you know?

18:07.971 --> 18:09.012
Like I was.

18:09.887 --> 18:10.926
And I know it.

18:12.064 --> 18:13.998
And my wife knows it, too.

18:19.341 --> 18:21.145
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks, man.

18:23.127 --> 18:24.833
See, that morning, uh,

18:25.350 --> 18:27.294
the morning that I had the thing,

18:28.197 --> 18:29.567
I was on the Internet.

18:29.729 --> 18:32.512
This site: "Where Your Baby Is Now."

18:33.808 --> 18:36.755
And at six months along,
they start dreaming.

18:37.391 --> 18:38.426
You know that?

18:39.480 --> 18:42.015
Before that, it's all cells
and parts, you know,

18:42.040 --> 18:44.122
but then they actually start dreaming.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.559
And that's a person, right?

18:47.573 --> 18:51.943
A whole little universe of hopes
and dreams and happiness

18:51.968 --> 18:53.401
and sadness, and I just thought,

18:53.426 --> 18:56.606
whoa, I... I can't be in charge
of a universe.

18:57.282 --> 19:00.247
I can't even hang a ceiling fan,
turns out.

19:03.842 --> 19:06.770
I don't have any answers,
except at work,

19:07.564 --> 19:10.278
but at work if I'm wrong,
it's just money.

19:11.308 --> 19:13.411
But what if I'm wrong with a baby?

19:15.298 --> 19:17.044
Why are you asking me?

19:19.318 --> 19:20.411
That.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.700
And if it's not racist, the turban.

19:24.551 --> 19:26.380
Eastern wisdom is
kind of a thing, right?

19:26.405 --> 19:28.591
Oh, yeah, East Trenton.

19:32.661 --> 19:33.880
I will tell you one thing.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.676
I have five kids.

19:36.007 --> 19:38.255
And before the first one was born,

19:38.532 --> 19:40.176
I was all questions, too.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.850
Can I? Will I?

19:44.116 --> 19:47.341
But what they don't
tell you is that babies

19:47.768 --> 19:49.270
come with the answers.

19:49.502 --> 19:52.458
They come out, they look up at you,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.091
and you at them, and...

19:59.571 --> 20:01.403
...they tell you who you are.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.001
You'll see.

20:05.049 --> 20:07.380
Tomorrow you'll have
all the answers you need.

20:08.021 --> 20:09.067
Huh.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.505
That's pretty good
for East Trenton, excuse me.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.223
Oh, man.

20:17.496 --> 20:18.880
What's the "G" stand for?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.091
Garuda.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.700
Damn.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.067
Almost had a baby named after me
until I said that, didn't I?

20:30.404 --> 20:31.692
Best fan on the market.

20:32.469 --> 20:33.497
Grab one.

20:33.522 --> 20:35.208
I'll meet you at Returns.

20:41.752 --> 20:43.106
Mm.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.294
Ma?

20:47.563 --> 20:48.575
What?

20:49.612 --> 20:51.669
No, no. No, we're inducing tomorrow.

20:51.694 --> 20:52.920
This isn't supposed to happen
until tomorrow.

20:52.944 --> 20:55.106
Yeah, I know. I know.

20:55.178 --> 20:57.679
I've called 911, but the roads
are blocked for Halloween.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.204
So just get home as soon as you can.

20:59.229 --> 21:01.163
Okay, I got him. I got him, sweetheart.

21:01.195 --> 21:03.275
- He's coming. He's coming, yeah.
- Tell him to come!

21:07.349 --> 21:08.520
It's happening, Garuda.

21:08.545 --> 21:09.708
It's happening.

21:17.943 --> 21:18.989
Hey, Brett.

21:19.685 --> 21:21.755
It's a great party, man.
This is awesome.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.220
And... oh, and that script, I
read that script this afternoon.

21:24.356 --> 21:26.024
Blew me away. Awesome.

21:26.058 --> 21:27.464
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

21:27.489 --> 21:29.260
- All yours.
- Oh, thank you. That...

21:29.287 --> 21:31.803
Are you, uh, are you casting
any more projects at the moment or...?

21:31.827 --> 21:34.195
No, I just like to cast
one movie at a time.

21:34.457 --> 21:36.044
- Funny that way.
- Right.

21:36.325 --> 21:37.809
I-I get it.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.239
Uh, that-that character Jason,
I'm-I'm in love with him.

21:41.372 --> 21:42.896
- I love it.
- Well, it's nothing on the page

21:42.920 --> 21:44.029
compared to what your
friend does with it.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.348
Yeah. Yeah, no, he's great...
I'm just, I'm...

21:47.584 --> 21:49.091
Well, I was just curious, uh...

21:49.850 --> 21:51.317
I mean, it's an interesting choice,

21:51.342 --> 21:52.489
you know, going with Zeke.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.255
Well, because the character's described

21:55.280 --> 21:57.817
like this all-American,
handsome guy, right?

21:58.281 --> 22:01.223
And Zeke's more, uh, he's like...

22:03.406 --> 22:05.366
I mean, come on, he's like
a character guy, right?

22:06.309 --> 22:09.536
Just, uh, I'm-I'm curious if
you read any actors, you know,

22:09.561 --> 22:10.842
like the character was described?

22:10.866 --> 22:12.051
You mean like you?

22:12.918 --> 22:15.786
No, I... I'm-I'm just,
I'm-I'm, I mean I could...

22:15.811 --> 22:17.903
I could come in and I could,
I could read it for you.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.832
You know, just so you get an idea

22:19.857 --> 22:23.326
of what it feels like,
you know, as it's... written.

22:24.073 --> 22:25.067
Or not.

22:25.092 --> 22:26.451
You know, I don't
have to do any of that...

22:26.475 --> 22:28.153
Look, Zeke's obviously
the right choice.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.786
He's-he's the right man for
the job, and I-I just, uh...

22:31.186 --> 22:33.333
- Congratulations on...
- Wow.

22:34.716 --> 22:37.351
You know, I-I thought
I had you pegged already.

22:37.581 --> 22:39.215
- Uh-huh.
- You know, pretty boy,

22:39.258 --> 22:40.833
big deal in high school.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.958
Actor, waiter, talent optional.

22:43.374 --> 22:45.130
There's a thousand of you guys out here.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.380
But what I never
figured you for was this.

22:47.828 --> 22:49.770
A guy that would
steal his friend's part.

22:51.445 --> 22:53.130
I... I don't know... I wasn't...

22:53.155 --> 22:54.833
You will never work for me, buddy.

22:55.058 --> 22:56.333
Not in a movie.

22:56.365 --> 22:57.950
Not even carrying a tray.

23:08.036 --> 23:10.098
Come on, Billy. Don't be a jerk.

23:11.079 --> 23:13.309
Please don't break
my little girl's heart.

23:22.510 --> 23:24.255
- How'd it go?
- It was awesome!

23:24.280 --> 23:25.613
He held my hand really tight

23:25.638 --> 23:26.887
when the goblin jumped out.

23:26.912 --> 23:28.279
Well, of course he held your hand.

23:28.304 --> 23:29.749
I mean, this-this is

23:29.773 --> 23:31.731
the most adorable hand in Pittsburgh.

23:31.783 --> 23:34.200
Next to your other
equally adorable hand.

23:34.225 --> 23:35.934
I mean, really it's a tie.

23:35.959 --> 23:38.645
- I got to tell Molly.
- Yeah. Go... go tell Molly.

23:39.672 --> 23:40.755
Oh.

23:46.614 --> 23:47.740
I'm gonna go with my friends.

23:47.764 --> 23:48.825
Hey, Kev, come here.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.419
Come here.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.793
Did you just give Billy your candy

23:57.818 --> 23:59.580
so that he'd hold hands
with your sister in there?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.333
I can always get more candy, Dad.

24:01.499 --> 24:02.499
It's easy.

24:02.656 --> 24:03.841
Can I go with my friends?

24:03.866 --> 24:05.442
- Yeah. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.848
Excuse me, have you guys seen Cher?

24:12.487 --> 24:14.708
No? Cher? Okay, thanks.

24:15.614 --> 24:16.848
Hey, Randall.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.512
Randall.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.333
Randall, stop!

24:21.106 --> 24:22.925
What? I did the Larsens' house.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.981
I improvised like you wanted
without my map.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.286
Now can I just go home?

24:26.311 --> 24:27.536
No. No, come here.

24:27.561 --> 24:28.739
I want you to sit down.

24:28.764 --> 24:30.364
Please. I want to talk to you.

24:33.324 --> 24:36.122
Hey. What is going on?

24:36.342 --> 24:37.973
You always talk to me.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.286
What's wrong?

24:40.308 --> 24:43.075
Did you and Dad lose the baby
and just couldn't find it?

24:43.741 --> 24:44.833
What?

24:45.096 --> 24:46.481
That's what the Larsens said.

24:46.564 --> 24:48.031
They said I was a miracle.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.563
Because you had three babies

24:49.588 --> 24:52.059
and you lost one and got me instead.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.559
Oh.

25:02.817 --> 25:03.989
Randall.

25:07.455 --> 25:09.403
We-we didn't lose him.

25:10.284 --> 25:11.489
Not like that.

25:15.351 --> 25:16.442
He didn't...

25:16.991 --> 25:18.559
He didn't live.

25:21.199 --> 25:22.731
Sometimes that can happen.

25:22.756 --> 25:27.473
Sometimes a baby dies...
right in the beginning.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.387
But your dad and I had

25:32.537 --> 25:34.942
all this room in our hearts
for three babies.

25:36.412 --> 25:37.676
And we saw you.

25:38.394 --> 25:39.630
We met you.

25:40.911 --> 25:42.567
So, yeah, you are a miracle.

25:43.722 --> 25:46.317
But you're not "instead" of anything.

25:46.342 --> 25:49.036
You are the way
it was always supposed to be.

25:55.172 --> 25:56.497
What was his name?

26:00.530 --> 26:01.606
Kyle.

26:04.637 --> 26:06.794
Kyle probably looked like you and Daddy.

26:08.215 --> 26:09.239
And them.

26:11.504 --> 26:12.739
Nobody looks like me.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.208
I know.

26:19.394 --> 26:22.997
Hey, this wasn't some big secret
we were keeping from you.

26:23.109 --> 26:25.716
We always, always
planned on telling you.

26:26.442 --> 26:28.723
We were just waiting
until you were old enough.

26:30.029 --> 26:31.091
I'm ten.

26:32.941 --> 26:34.130
Yes, you are.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.403
You're ten and a bit.

26:55.484 --> 26:56.934
- Good, sweetheart.
- Hey!

26:57.707 --> 26:59.551
- Oh, Randall, thank God.
- She okay?

26:59.576 --> 27:00.976
- She's fine.
- Hey. You okay, baby?

27:01.001 --> 27:02.787
The ambulance is still
about five minutes away.

27:02.811 --> 27:04.045
How did you get here so quickly?

27:04.069 --> 27:05.981
- No, I left the car on Maple.
- Oh... come down.

27:06.005 --> 27:07.183
- I'm here now.
- Yeah, yeah, he's here.

27:07.207 --> 27:08.519
- You just hold on to me. Okay.
- I got to go down.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.022
- I got you.
- Yeah, okay. Okay, okay.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.451
- I'm scared, Randall.
- It's okay, baby.

27:11.475 --> 27:12.906
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing, sweetheart.

27:12.930 --> 27:15.231
- Oh! Ow!
- Okay. Okay.

27:15.609 --> 27:17.395
Um, she's crowning.

27:17.991 --> 27:20.567
- This is happening.
- Ow!

27:22.149 --> 27:24.583
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go get some towels.

27:24.608 --> 27:25.848
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.911
Shift. Okay.

27:30.161 --> 27:31.572
- How far away is the ambulance?
- They're coming.

27:31.596 --> 27:32.973
They're coming. They're coming.
Just breathe.

27:32.997 --> 27:34.174
- No! No, no.
- Sweetheart, you just need to breathe.

27:34.198 --> 27:35.599
I'll just... I'll wait. I'll wait.

27:35.633 --> 27:37.144
No, you can't wait.
You can't wait. Hey, Beth.

27:37.168 --> 27:40.348
Beth, honey, this isn't two months ago.

27:40.583 --> 27:42.520
Or last week or even this morning.

27:42.551 --> 27:45.200
This is now, and I see you, baby.

27:46.598 --> 27:50.395
And I can see our baby's head,
and we got this, okay?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.761
- Okay.
- I got you.

27:52.786 --> 27:55.122
- Okay.
- Okay. Mm.

27:55.184 --> 27:56.393
And you're doing great.

27:56.921 --> 27:58.559
- I got to move.
- Okay. Okay.

27:58.622 --> 28:00.099
- I need to...
- Okay, where you going?

28:00.123 --> 28:01.757
Okay, get this under her.

28:03.593 --> 28:05.438
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

28:05.462 --> 28:06.762
Push, push, push. Come on.

28:06.796 --> 28:08.506
Breathe. They're telling
me you got to push again.

28:08.530 --> 28:09.075
Okay.

28:09.099 --> 28:11.028
- On this next contraction...
- Okay.

28:26.742 --> 28:28.059
- Oh!
- It's a girl.

28:31.287 --> 28:32.887
Here we are. Here we are.

28:33.256 --> 28:34.348
Okay.

28:37.388 --> 28:39.200
It's okay. It's okay.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.216
Well, I got an early morning.

28:55.762 --> 28:56.817
I better go.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.911
You're married, aren't you?

29:13.375 --> 29:16.278
Yeah. You never talk about
your life, other than work.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.778
And you left your neighborhood bar

29:20.025 --> 29:21.700
when you saw people noticing me.

29:22.009 --> 29:24.403
And now you're scrambling to go home.

29:25.419 --> 29:26.966
I'm pretty sure, uh...

29:27.586 --> 29:28.637
Yeah, I'm...

29:28.875 --> 29:32.012
I knew about it for a while,
so I'm not judging you.

29:34.788 --> 29:38.758
So... why'd you do this?

29:39.292 --> 29:40.403
If you knew.

29:43.313 --> 29:44.583
I don't know.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.333
I...

29:50.677 --> 29:54.036
I'm just tired of waiting
for things to feel right.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.919
Nothing has felt right in a long time.

29:59.015 --> 30:02.851
I thought... that maybe
I would just do it

30:02.876 --> 30:05.184
and it'll feel right after.

30:07.456 --> 30:08.723
Which it doesn't.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.684
At all.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.161
I don't know what to say.

30:23.399 --> 30:25.114
Kate? It's Mom.

30:25.361 --> 30:27.356
- Pick up, pick up, pick up!
- Ugh, God.

30:27.381 --> 30:29.216
Randall and Beth had a baby girl!

30:29.499 --> 30:31.433
Oh, my God. Can you hand me the phone?

30:31.458 --> 30:32.700
Oh, pick up, pick up!

30:40.813 --> 30:42.817
Kate, hey. What time is it there?

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
What?

30:47.711 --> 30:49.137
A girl? Yeah?

30:49.162 --> 30:50.887
Oh, that's...

30:52.036 --> 30:53.153
That's wonderful.

30:54.336 --> 30:55.426
Uh...

30:56.875 --> 30:57.926
Yeah.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.122
Yeah, I could probably get away.

31:01.624 --> 31:02.708
Oh, babe.

31:03.649 --> 31:05.161
I got to tell you what...

31:05.823 --> 31:07.372
Oh, no, what happened?

31:10.655 --> 31:14.473
The Larsens told Randall about Kyle.

31:18.186 --> 31:19.285
Yeah.

31:21.686 --> 31:23.720
And you weren't there,

31:23.745 --> 31:26.286
and I had to tell him everything.

31:27.633 --> 31:28.794
All by myself.

31:28.846 --> 31:30.028
I'm sorry.

31:30.733 --> 31:32.317
I'm sorry. How did it go?

31:33.647 --> 31:36.466
Oh, I think, I think it went okay.

31:36.491 --> 31:37.653
I don't know.

31:37.738 --> 31:38.770
Ugh.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.942
I just, I wanted you
to be there, you know?

31:42.429 --> 31:44.163
I know. I know.

31:44.188 --> 31:46.255
'Cause what's Cher without Sonny?

31:47.039 --> 31:49.270
- Right?
- I think it's the other way around.

31:49.295 --> 31:50.630
- No.
- Yeah.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.020
Yeah.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.841
I don't know how any of this
would work without you.

31:56.674 --> 31:58.008
♪ In the spring...

31:58.276 --> 32:00.044
Well, we don't need to worry about that.

32:00.364 --> 32:01.786
Because you got me, babe.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.223
You know what, that'd be a great
song. Right? Wouldn't it?

32:05.248 --> 32:06.581
Not with you singing it.

32:06.606 --> 32:08.440
Oh, not with me singing it? Okay.

32:10.802 --> 32:13.192
Mom! You ready
to get back to the hospital?

32:13.458 --> 32:14.925
Beth said the baby just latched.

32:15.155 --> 32:17.512
- Ma.
- I'm sorry.

32:17.581 --> 32:19.872
I'm sorry, it just slipped
out of my hands.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.130
No, it's okay.

32:21.878 --> 32:22.911
It's okay.

32:26.169 --> 32:29.036
That was one of the happiest
moments of my life.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.950
Okay.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.239
So these are happy tears?

32:36.602 --> 32:38.505
But also your dad isn't here.

32:41.865 --> 32:44.161
And that's just something
I'm gonna have to deal with

32:44.186 --> 32:45.856
for the rest of my life.

32:45.913 --> 32:48.815
The happiest moments will also be...

32:49.466 --> 32:51.122
a little sad.

32:53.020 --> 32:54.255
I know, Mom.

32:56.698 --> 32:58.059
He probably would've taken credit

32:58.084 --> 32:59.387
for all that hair on her head,

32:59.412 --> 33:01.132
even though it's got
nothing to do with him.

33:03.767 --> 33:05.544
Yeah. He would have.

33:10.449 --> 33:12.012
What are you gonna name her?

33:12.669 --> 33:13.770
Oh, man.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.659
Uh...

33:16.240 --> 33:17.512
We had Jack for a boy.

33:19.105 --> 33:20.278
That was the plan.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.102
And, uh, Jasmine for a girl,

33:23.168 --> 33:25.575
but we're not sold on it yet.

33:25.702 --> 33:27.700
It doesn't have to be
a "J" name, Randall.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.458
It'll come to you.

33:31.862 --> 33:32.872
Yeah.

33:33.409 --> 33:34.481
I'm sure it will.

33:36.612 --> 33:38.528
I'm sorry.

33:38.553 --> 33:39.786
It's okay. I got you.

34:24.574 --> 34:25.708
Wow.

34:26.167 --> 34:28.176
This is a huge house.

34:28.302 --> 34:29.302
Yeah.

34:31.746 --> 34:32.949
What a day, huh?

34:33.692 --> 34:35.716
Epic day, yeah, you know.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.067
We finally have proof
that Randall had sex

34:38.092 --> 34:39.851
at least one time in his life.

34:39.882 --> 34:41.255
So, that's exciting.

34:42.737 --> 34:45.340
Yeah. Everything is falling
into place for him.

34:45.364 --> 34:46.341
Mm-hmm.

34:46.366 --> 34:48.176
Which is great, right?

34:48.201 --> 34:50.293
'Cause if Randall figures his crap out,

34:50.319 --> 34:52.255
we're, like, five years away

34:52.380 --> 34:54.208
from you and me figuring out ours.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.458
Right? And I met that great new guy...

34:56.484 --> 34:59.169
Yeah, and... yeah, and, uh,
and I'm crushing it.

34:59.194 --> 35:00.497
Right? In L.A.

35:01.107 --> 35:03.653
I'm telling you, it's all
happening for us, you know?

35:03.707 --> 35:06.130
- It is.
- Happening for us in the 20s.

35:06.155 --> 35:07.083
Mm-hmm.

35:07.108 --> 35:09.911
- Crushing the 20s.
- Crushing the 20s.

35:11.056 --> 35:12.489
- Bam.
- Mmm.

35:21.179 --> 35:23.341
I haven't had an audition
in, like, six months.

35:24.384 --> 35:25.919
The new guy is married.

35:28.896 --> 35:29.896
Real... oh.

35:31.370 --> 35:32.505
Thanks.

35:32.845 --> 35:34.528
- Have a little more?
- Okay.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.676
Married, huh?

35:39.834 --> 35:41.575
Yeah. But he's nice,

35:41.600 --> 35:42.926
which makes it harder.

35:43.354 --> 35:44.888
He asks questions.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.403
- He knows my class schedule.
- I mean, come on,

35:47.428 --> 35:49.684
that's, you know, that's-that's a...
that's a low bar.

35:55.282 --> 35:57.551
You really haven't had
an audition in six months?

35:58.288 --> 36:00.801
No, it's been more
like a year, actually.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.911
Where are you at?
I mean, what are you...

36:05.935 --> 36:08.684
You still sitting in your car,
eating fast food,

36:08.709 --> 36:10.473
staring at where the house used to be?

36:14.066 --> 36:15.231
He's gone.

36:16.671 --> 36:18.387
Okay? And he's not coming back,

36:18.412 --> 36:21.333
and even if you sit there
in the exact same spot

36:21.358 --> 36:23.231
that you were when he left, he's not...

36:24.306 --> 36:25.395
coming back.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.723
I know.

36:30.869 --> 36:32.520
And he wouldn't want you to stay.

36:34.251 --> 36:36.184
Not if there was nothing for you there.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.762
You know what he'd want for you?

36:40.280 --> 36:41.419
Hmm?

36:41.968 --> 36:43.036
Everything.

36:45.165 --> 36:46.426
Yeah, for you, too.

36:53.267 --> 36:56.203
You know, maybe I'll take
an acting class. I know it's...

36:56.776 --> 37:00.145
Or join a crappy improv troupe.
I guess I could do that.

37:00.170 --> 37:02.071
That's the spirit. Yes.

37:02.416 --> 37:03.770
I bet you're hilarious.

37:03.795 --> 37:06.372
I'm probably a pretty funny guy.

37:38.467 --> 37:39.841
Hi, little boy.

37:41.282 --> 37:43.926
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get over here.

37:50.530 --> 37:52.801
I was really nervous to meet you.

37:53.756 --> 37:54.825
See...

37:55.580 --> 37:58.294
I talked to my other babies over there

37:58.957 --> 38:00.973
the whole time they were inside of me.

38:03.129 --> 38:04.903
But you weren't there, so...

38:08.188 --> 38:10.645
I wanted to come and introduce myself.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.911
And say hello and let you hear my voice.

38:23.169 --> 38:25.153
Hi there, sweet girl.

38:25.414 --> 38:28.192
I wanted to properly welcome you
to the world.

38:29.255 --> 38:30.458
You are...

38:30.957 --> 38:32.176
beautiful.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.856
Oh, my goodness.

38:34.004 --> 38:36.755
I mean, all babies
are beautiful, but you...

38:39.977 --> 38:42.559
...you are Randall and Beth beautiful.

38:44.562 --> 38:46.051
And that is special.

38:51.098 --> 38:52.270
You know...

38:53.908 --> 38:55.864
I've been here before, Tess.

38:57.208 --> 39:00.114
You think that you're at the
beginning of your journey, right?

39:02.008 --> 39:04.372
But you also began a long time ago.

39:04.792 --> 39:05.926
Do you know that?

39:06.718 --> 39:08.301
'Cause I was there,

39:10.176 --> 39:12.137
and somebody else was there, too.

39:14.848 --> 39:16.731
Somebody really good.

39:18.529 --> 39:20.255
And we lost a baby,

39:21.002 --> 39:23.294
and we thought it was an ending, but...

39:24.179 --> 39:26.137
it was also a beginning.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.966
Do you see those guys over there?

39:30.991 --> 39:32.992
That's your brother and your sister.

39:36.476 --> 39:37.919
That's Kevin and Kate.

39:39.630 --> 39:43.145
And the man, the sweet man
who fed you this afternoon?

39:46.321 --> 39:47.466
That's your dad.

39:49.459 --> 39:51.426
And life has a middle, too,

39:51.594 --> 39:54.247
and middles can be the
hardest because...

39:55.240 --> 39:57.887
that's when you can get really lost.

40:00.182 --> 40:02.559
But middles can be a
beginning sometimes.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.176
Welcome to Hollywood.

40:04.548 --> 40:05.911
- Please!
- Fine.

40:06.054 --> 40:08.309
I know I'm the best hairstylist
in town,

40:08.334 --> 40:09.919
- so I'll do your hair.
- Yes!

40:10.055 --> 40:11.357
I'll put cornrows in it, and I'll make

40:11.381 --> 40:12.888
- you look like Beyoncé.
- Yes!

40:12.913 --> 40:13.989
And if you're lucky,

40:14.845 --> 40:16.434
you can have it all.

40:18.112 --> 40:19.169
And you...

40:20.163 --> 40:21.278
are lucky.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.380
You are the luckiest,

40:25.643 --> 40:26.708
prettiest,

40:28.052 --> 40:29.692
sweetest baby

40:31.231 --> 40:33.255
ever named after a ceiling fan.

40:35.301 --> 40:37.403
Oh.

40:38.549 --> 40:39.637
I think I...

40:41.189 --> 40:43.114
forgot to introduce myself.

40:49.587 --> 40:50.684
I'm your mom.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.325
You know, I thought my
journey had come to an end,

41:01.350 --> 41:02.750
but I don't know.

41:02.906 --> 41:04.216
I don't know. Maybe...

41:04.540 --> 41:06.176
maybe we're both

41:06.630 --> 41:08.169
at our next beginning.
