00:01.420 --> 00:03.216
We're suing you and your
entire firm for fraud.

00:03.418 --> 00:04.718
I never saw this thing
in my life.

00:04.924 --> 00:06.158
That document
never came into this office,

00:06.225 --> 00:07.359
or you would have seen it.

00:07.426 --> 00:08.426
A lot of people
are gonna think

00:08.494 --> 00:10.128
I buried that document.

00:10.196 --> 00:11.830
How can you bury
what doesn't exist?

00:11.898 --> 00:12.898
You think that I don't know
that there's a power struggle

00:12.965 --> 00:14.366
going on between Jessica
and Hardman?

00:14.433 --> 00:16.033
This guy gets one whiff
of what we've been hiding

00:16.102 --> 00:18.370
from Hardman--
I know, we can't trust him.

00:18.437 --> 00:20.972
Louis, is there anything
you want to tell me?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.674
Let me explain
something to you.

00:22.742 --> 00:24.476
That memo doesn't hurt me.
It helps me.

00:24.544 --> 00:25.944
It's gone.

00:26.012 --> 00:28.146
Your actions
have left me no choice

00:28.214 --> 00:30.182
but to terminate your employment
at Pearson Hardman,

00:30.249 --> 00:34.186
effective immediately.

00:59.145 --> 01:02.280
Ray, I need you
to pick me up in an hour,

01:02.348 --> 01:04.916
and I need you
to bring me a tux.

01:07.053 --> 01:08.820
That's thrilling--

01:08.888 --> 01:10.388
I'm not here.

01:12.458 --> 01:13.892
God, what...

01:13.960 --> 01:15.861
what are you doing here?

01:15.928 --> 01:17.729
Are you watching
<i>Diff'rent Strokes?</i>

01:17.797 --> 01:19.798
Uh, yeah, well,
it's the touching story

01:19.866 --> 01:21.833
of a couple of orphans, so...
Don't.

01:21.901 --> 01:23.768
It's a nice building.

01:23.836 --> 01:25.370
How long ago
was it condemned?

01:25.438 --> 01:27.005
Oh, great, so did you come
all the way over here

01:27.073 --> 01:28.940
just to criticize
where I live, or...

01:29.008 --> 01:30.375
That's a side benefit.

01:30.443 --> 01:32.310
You've got to be kidding me.
What?

01:32.378 --> 01:34.045
Ah, that--
sentimental value.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.047
So just put that away.

01:36.115 --> 01:37.315
- Nice panda.
- Thank you.

01:37.383 --> 01:38.783
Grandmother.
Christmas thing.

01:38.851 --> 01:41.353
Get your tux on.
We got a situation.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.954
A situation
that requires a tux?

01:43.022 --> 01:45.023
Where--where
is this tuxedo situation?

01:45.091 --> 01:47.492
Atlantic City.
Can you get dressed now?

01:47.560 --> 01:48.593
- Yeah, I could.
- But?

01:48.661 --> 01:51.196
I don't have a tux.

01:51.264 --> 01:52.497
I'm not Bruce Wayne.

01:53.448 --> 01:55.215
Don't I know it.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.430
Wow.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.101
Rachel.

02:14.169 --> 02:15.202
Louis, hi.

02:15.270 --> 02:17.237
At the ballet.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.839
Are you an aficionado?

02:18.907 --> 02:20.607
Since I was a girl,
yes.

02:20.675 --> 02:23.110
Me too.
I mean, a boy.

02:23.178 --> 02:24.378
I got that.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.679
So are you--

02:25.747 --> 02:27.114
you here with someone?

02:27.182 --> 02:28.382
You know, Donna was supposed
to come with me,

02:28.449 --> 02:30.217
and then she cancelled
at the last minute.

02:30.285 --> 02:31.285
Oh, you talked to her?
How is she?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.486
No, I haven't.

02:32.554 --> 02:33.687
I keep calling,
but she just won't...

02:33.755 --> 02:35.122
Answer.
I know. I tried.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.324
You tried?

02:37.392 --> 02:40.127
Yeah.

02:40.195 --> 02:42.462
Are you here
with someone?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.931
Oh, I'm alone.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.632
I feel it's a better way to
experience the dance, you know?

02:45.700 --> 02:47.801
Too distracting
to have to talk about it.

02:47.869 --> 02:49.570
I just want to--
To feel it.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.671
No, I know.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.945
I should probably
get going.

02:58.012 --> 03:01.882
Wait.
I have an extra ticket,

03:01.950 --> 03:04.117
third row.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.853
Yeah, I like to buy
a seat to my right

03:05.920 --> 03:08.989
just as a precaution.

03:09.057 --> 03:11.325
Yeah.
I would love to.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.660
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay.

03:13.728 --> 03:16.096
You just carry around
an extra tux

03:16.164 --> 03:17.297
for the random occasion?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.565
Something told me
you'd need it.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.334
And by "something,"
I mean common sense.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.636
And by "need it,"
I mean you're an idiot.

03:22.704 --> 03:24.805
Haha.
So can I ask why

03:24.873 --> 03:28.375
we are going to Atlantic City
instead of just messengering

03:28.443 --> 03:30.277
these contracts?
No.

03:30.345 --> 03:32.012
You know, I'm sensing
a little hostility,

03:32.080 --> 03:33.247
and you know what I think?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.515
I think
that you're still stung

03:35.583 --> 03:37.084
about Donna,
and you see a chance

03:37.151 --> 03:40.220
to blow off some steam,
and you need a wingman.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.656
Easy, Dr. Phil.
We're here.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.959
There.
How's that?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.508
That's right.
We're not in Kansas anymore.

04:01.576 --> 04:02.976
Let's move, Dorothy.

04:03.044 --> 04:05.245
You didn't tell me
you were bringing me here.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.980
And that's a problem how?

04:07.048 --> 04:09.316
I'm sort of banned
from here.

04:09.384 --> 04:10.817
For smoking weed?

04:10.885 --> 04:12.953
Counting cards.
I mean, I was smoking weed,

04:13.021 --> 04:14.621
but they banned me
for counting cards.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.123
What?
My brain just does it.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.724
I can't help
that it keeps track.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.226
And that's your defense?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.228
It was three years ago.
I was broke.

04:21.296 --> 04:22.963
Well, which is it,
your brain just does it,

04:23.031 --> 04:24.197
or you were broke?

04:24.265 --> 04:25.332
What are you,
some kind of lawyer?

04:25.400 --> 04:26.733
Get inside.
You're wearing a tux.

04:26.801 --> 04:29.703
They're not gonna know
who you are.

04:29.771 --> 04:32.306
Speaking of which,
this isn't Havana in the 1950s.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.640
Why do we have
to wear tuxes?

04:33.708 --> 04:34.841
What are you,
Moe Green?

04:34.909 --> 04:35.943
Moe Green lived in Vegas.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.377
I know
where Moe Green lives.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.579
Complimentary champagne?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.848
You think this happens
if you walk in here

04:41.916 --> 04:43.617
in a T-shirt
and jeans?

04:43.685 --> 04:45.185
You have a guest,
Keith Hoyt.

04:45.253 --> 04:47.187
Can you let him know
I'm here?

04:47.255 --> 04:49.589
Mr. Hoyt left a message
for you to meet him

04:49.657 --> 04:51.758
in the Poker Room,
Mr. Specter.

04:51.826 --> 04:53.226
The floor manager
assured me

04:53.294 --> 04:55.128
that he'd be kept away
from the tables.

04:55.196 --> 04:58.131
I'm sorry, I have
no record of that here, sir.

05:00.935 --> 05:02.336
Double down.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.503
Okay, so let me
get this straight,

05:03.571 --> 05:05.505
he has a gambling problem?

05:05.573 --> 05:06.974
And drinking.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.575
Why is he
in Atlantic City?

05:08.643 --> 05:10.243
Because he's
the keynote speaker

05:10.311 --> 05:11.645
at a clean energy conference,

05:11.713 --> 05:14.181
and he promised me
he'd stay out of trouble.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.749
And you took the word
of an addict?

05:18.519 --> 05:19.753
He's been clean
five years.

05:19.821 --> 05:21.321
No drinking,
no gambling.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.489
So that's why you're here.

05:22.557 --> 05:23.690
You're concerned
about him.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.359
- Yes.
- But you also want to gamble.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.061
He has a problem.
I do not have a problem.

05:28.129 --> 05:30.130
Uhhuh.

05:35.003 --> 05:37.704
Holy shit.

05:37.772 --> 05:38.905
Look at this guy.

05:38.973 --> 05:41.008
Those are $25,000 chips.

05:41.075 --> 05:44.644
That's three stacks of four...
by seven...

05:44.712 --> 05:47.147
That is $3,125,000.

05:47.215 --> 05:49.683
That's Keith.

05:49.751 --> 05:52.819
Well, at least we don't have
to worry about him losing.

05:52.887 --> 05:55.288
All in.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.823
- Or...
- Keith.

05:56.891 --> 05:58.892
Harvey.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.394
This is a bad idea.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.496
You haven't seen my hand.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.535
I call.

06:16.244 --> 06:17.611
Straight.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.851
Full house.

06:24.919 --> 06:26.286
- He's got one out.
- Yeah, we're fine

06:26.354 --> 06:29.656
- unless the river's a...
- 10 of clubs.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.036
That is some tough luck
right there.

06:43.104 --> 06:46.006
Tommy, please,
just give me 48 hours.

06:46.074 --> 06:48.742
Sorry, Keith.
Deal's a deal.

06:48.810 --> 06:50.744
- Tommy.
- That was insane.

06:50.812 --> 06:52.946
You just lost $3 million.
Who the hell's that guy?

06:53.014 --> 06:56.516
It's worse.
That napkin--

06:56.584 --> 06:58.518

lost my company.

Explain to me,
how you sell your company

07:37.087 --> 07:38.888
on a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

07:38.956 --> 07:39.989
I didn't sell it.

07:40.057 --> 07:42.792
I just put it up
as collateral.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.461
On a cocktail napkin
at a poker table.

07:45.529 --> 07:47.897
I had aces
full of kings.

07:47.965 --> 07:49.132
The odds were with him.

07:49.199 --> 07:51.000
Come on, you saw it.
It was bullshit.

07:51.068 --> 07:53.002
The guy rivered me.
No, what's bullshit is,

07:53.070 --> 07:54.404
you should have
never been at that table

07:54.471 --> 07:56.506
in the first place,
much less drunk at that table.

07:56.573 --> 07:58.007
I gave
the keynote speech, Harvey.

07:58.075 --> 08:01.511
They toasted me.
I had...one drink.

08:01.578 --> 08:03.246
You're an alcoholic
at a casino.

08:03.313 --> 08:04.747
You don't get any drinks.

08:04.815 --> 08:07.817
I'm not an alcoholic.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

08:07.885 --> 08:09.786
And those dots
aren't connected?

08:09.853 --> 08:11.988
Let me explain.
You had a drink.

08:12.055 --> 08:14.023
You gambled.
You lost your company.

08:14.091 --> 08:17.260
I know, it was stupid.
Is there anything we can do?

08:17.327 --> 08:18.261
What I should do
is walk through that door

08:18.328 --> 08:19.262
and make you
live with this.

08:19.329 --> 08:20.563
Well, you won't,
will you?

08:20.631 --> 08:23.366
Because you owe me.

08:28.105 --> 08:31.307
What exactly
was on the napkin?

08:31.375 --> 08:33.275
I don't
remember exactly,

08:33.342 --> 08:34.910
but the deal was,
he was gonna give me

08:34.977 --> 08:36.578
$3 million
to back my bet,

08:36.647 --> 08:38.448
and when I won,
I'd give him his money back

08:38.515 --> 08:40.283
with an extra $1/2 million.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.418
And if you lost,
he'd just get the company.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.955
I didn't think
I could lose.

08:46.023 --> 08:48.357
We need to get
a look at that napkin.

08:48.425 --> 08:50.026
Need to get
a look at that napkin.

08:50.093 --> 08:52.028
You need to keep an eye on him
and make sure he doesn't

08:52.095 --> 08:54.564
touch a drink, a chip,
or a deck of cards.

08:54.631 --> 08:56.232
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm at Atlantic City.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.667
I'm in a tux.
You want me babysitting?

08:57.734 --> 08:58.835
I'm supposed to be
your wingman.

08:58.902 --> 09:00.369
I'm trusting you
with him.

09:00.437 --> 09:02.371
That is
being my wingman.

09:02.439 --> 09:04.574
No, th--

09:07.544 --> 09:09.278
- Magnificent.
- Superb.

09:09.346 --> 09:11.314
- Riveting.
- Outrageous.

09:11.381 --> 09:12.482
Insulting.

09:12.549 --> 09:15.318
Disgusting.

09:15.385 --> 09:16.819
Don't let it
ruin your evening.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.721
- I'm--I mean, I won't.
- No.

09:18.789 --> 09:19.856
- I won't.
- Yeah.

09:19.923 --> 09:21.724
I wo
hey, asshole.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.059
Why don't you have
a little more respect for the--

09:23.126 --> 09:24.360
oh, my God,
it's you.

09:24.428 --> 09:28.364
- Yes, it is I.
- Sergei Baskov!

09:28.432 --> 09:30.800
I profaned at you.
I'm so sorry.

09:30.868 --> 09:32.969
No, no, no, please,
you're defending the ballet.

09:33.036 --> 09:34.904
I was defending
the ballet.

09:34.972 --> 09:39.075
Our rehearsal space...

09:39.142 --> 09:42.278
two ballerinas
sprained their ankles.

09:42.346 --> 09:44.647
Well, that's why Katya
didn't dance tonight.

09:44.715 --> 09:45.915
- Of course.
- Sadly, yes.

09:45.983 --> 09:48.551
The Royal Hall is
beautiful, magnificent,

09:48.619 --> 09:52.288
but behind the scenes,
they look with a blind eye.

09:52.356 --> 09:55.191
Well, if I may be so bold,

09:55.259 --> 09:56.626
please, it would
be my honor

09:56.693 --> 09:58.461
to right
this wrong for you.

09:58.529 --> 10:00.129
Oh, I could not impose.

10:00.197 --> 10:03.499
Thank you
so much though.

10:03.567 --> 10:04.934
Please, allow me
to be your Nutcracker

10:05.002 --> 10:06.769
and join in the battle
against the Mouse King.

10:06.837 --> 10:08.037
The Mouse King.

10:08.105 --> 10:09.939
Well, in that instance,

10:10.007 --> 10:13.409
then I would be in your debt,
Mr...Light.

10:13.477 --> 10:14.677
- It's actually Mr.--
- Wonderful.

10:14.745 --> 10:16.379
Thank you.
Wonderful.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.628
Oh, excuse me,
I'm terribly sorry.

10:32.696 --> 10:34.797
You know what
a napkin's good for, Tommy?

10:34.865 --> 10:37.466
That's what
a napkin's good for.

10:37.534 --> 10:40.803
Peter Lawford called.
He wants his tux back.

10:40.871 --> 10:42.338
Let me tell you something.

10:42.406 --> 10:44.674
Steven Spielberg
did a pre-nup on a napkin.

10:44.741 --> 10:46.876
Didn't hold up,
which is why Amy Irving

10:46.944 --> 10:49.278
is the richest out-of-work
actress in Hollywood.

10:49.346 --> 10:51.414
That's because
his napkin didn't meet

10:51.481 --> 10:53.883
the minimum requirements
of a contract.

10:53.951 --> 10:55.284
My client's does.

10:55.352 --> 10:56.852
Why did you ask me
what exactly

10:56.920 --> 10:58.220
was written
on the napkin?

10:58.288 --> 10:59.789
'Cause no matter
what it was written on,

10:59.856 --> 11:02.291
for a contract to be valid,
it needs to have three things:

11:02.359 --> 11:04.160
An offer, acceptance...

11:04.227 --> 11:05.227
And consideration.

11:05.295 --> 11:07.163
- What's consideration?
- Quid pro quo.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.298
You both get something.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.400
Like I get his chips
and he gets my--

11:11.468 --> 11:13.235
Company.
That is a valid--

11:13.303 --> 11:14.670
Contract, yes.

11:14.738 --> 11:16.706
You forgot one thing:
Competence.

11:16.773 --> 11:18.641
My client was drunk,
and you knew it.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.277
Do you have proof of that?
How many drinks did he have?

11:21.345 --> 11:23.446
- I don't remember.
- That's a good start.

11:23.513 --> 11:24.547
Well, here's
what's gonna happen.

11:24.615 --> 11:26.515
We're going to give you
your money back

11:26.583 --> 11:28.050
and throw in the $500,000

11:28.118 --> 11:29.885
you would have
gotten had Keith won,

11:29.953 --> 11:32.154
and then we're never
gonna hear from you again.

11:32.222 --> 11:33.656
Sorry.

11:33.724 --> 11:37.259
My advisors tell me that that
company's worth $30 million,

11:37.327 --> 11:38.995
and I'm keeping it.

11:39.062 --> 11:40.696
Well, when you show up to
open the door with your napkin,

11:40.764 --> 11:42.632
it's not gonna fit
in the lock.

11:42.699 --> 11:43.933
So if he wants
to take your company,

11:44.001 --> 11:45.368
he's gonna have
to do it in court.

11:45.435 --> 11:47.837
And then,
you'll be playing at my table.

11:54.678 --> 11:55.611
I need a list of everything
that's wrong

11:55.679 --> 11:57.046
with the rehearsal space.

11:57.114 --> 11:58.414
For example,
the creaky floorboards,

11:58.482 --> 12:00.249
they're affecting
certain dancers' attitudes.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.585
Oh, they shouldn't
let that get them down.

12:02.653 --> 12:04.053
"Attitude" is a pose.

12:04.121 --> 12:06.789
Oh, yeah,
like striking an attitude.

12:06.857 --> 12:09.358
Whatever, I do that
all the time.

12:09.426 --> 12:11.360
Okay.

12:11.428 --> 12:14.063
I also need a list of
the ballet company principals.

12:14.131 --> 12:16.799
Okay, um,
integrity, fidelity,

12:16.867 --> 12:18.601
patriotism--
Not that kind of principle.

12:18.669 --> 12:20.936
- Okay, we're done.
- How am I supposed to know?

12:21.004 --> 12:23.105
Rachel, you've
just been drafted.

12:23.173 --> 12:25.007
Oh, but she's
not even a--

12:25.075 --> 12:26.742
Not what?
She's not what, Harold?

12:26.810 --> 12:28.778
Ms. Zane not only knows
more about ballet than you do,

12:28.845 --> 12:30.246
she also knows
more about law.

12:30.313 --> 12:32.314
- But--
- zip it.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.784
My mind's been racing ever since
we met Sergei yesterday,

12:34.851 --> 12:37.486
so I dictated a to-do list
for you to handle.

12:37.554 --> 12:39.288
I'm on it.

12:39.356 --> 12:42.958
Okay.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.798
- Jessica.
- Where are you?

12:48.865 --> 12:50.866
- In a meeting.
- Do people often yell

12:50.934 --> 12:53.202
"I hit the jackpot"
in your meetings?

12:53.270 --> 12:55.604
If you know where I am,
why are you asking?

12:55.672 --> 12:58.074
Because the answer tells me
I should be worried.

12:58.141 --> 13:00.643
It's just poker.

13:00.711 --> 13:02.645
Harvey, I know
losing Donna's been hard.

13:02.713 --> 13:04.547
I'm fine.

13:04.614 --> 13:06.515
You haven't hired
her replacement.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.284
She's irreplaceable.

13:08.351 --> 13:11.120
- I'm assigning you a temp.
- Excellent.

13:11.188 --> 13:12.688
Not for you.
You should fold.

13:12.756 --> 13:15.424
- Damn it.
- I swear I'm listening.

13:15.492 --> 13:17.793
No, no, the judge
assigned to your fraud case

13:17.861 --> 13:20.062
just denied our motion to seal.
What?

13:20.130 --> 13:21.731
That motion's a slam dunk,
and we need it.

13:21.798 --> 13:23.466
Who's the judge?
Ella Follman.

13:23.533 --> 13:24.834
Don't know her.
You?

13:24.901 --> 13:27.937
I'm about to.
We're already being sued,

13:28.004 --> 13:31.140
but I guess she decided
my headache wasn't big enough.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.877
Now come home before
you wind up in trouble.

13:34.945 --> 13:37.079
I'm doing just fine.

13:40.016 --> 13:41.650
I had nothing.

13:41.718 --> 13:43.352
Are you trying
to impress me?

13:43.420 --> 13:44.887
With nothing?

13:44.955 --> 13:46.622
I don't remember you
impressing that easily.

13:46.690 --> 13:48.958
I don't remember
being impressed at all.

13:51.561 --> 13:54.497
I need copies of last night's
poker room security footage.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.065
- I can't give you that.
- Yes, you can.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.366
And you will.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.041
Thank you.

14:06.109 --> 14:07.743
Hello, Jessica.

14:07.811 --> 14:11.147
Ella...
Ella Medeiros.

14:11.214 --> 14:13.315
Ella Follman.
Married name.

14:13.383 --> 14:15.851
- I haven't seen you since--
- Your little prank?

14:20.891 --> 14:23.225
Oh, the things we do
when we're young.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.729
- What can I do for you?
- You denied our motion.

14:26.797 --> 14:28.864
I have to say, I'd assumed
it was a formality.

14:28.932 --> 14:31.500
Well, you know what
they say about assuming.

14:31.568 --> 14:34.370
- Ella--
- It's Judge Follman.

14:34.437 --> 14:37.239
<i>Judge</i> Follman...

14:37.307 --> 14:39.241
These allegations
are serious.

14:39.309 --> 14:41.177
I know
how serious they are,

14:41.244 --> 14:44.713
and I also know how important
this case is to your firm.

14:44.781 --> 14:46.315
Then you also know that,
until proven,

14:46.383 --> 14:49.552
they have no business being
placed in public record.

14:49.619 --> 14:52.154
I see what you're saying.

14:52.222 --> 14:56.192
Humiliating someone for no good
reason doesn't seem fair.

14:59.262 --> 15:01.664
Do we have a problem?

15:01.731 --> 15:03.766
No, not at all.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.167
I just happen to be
of the opinion

15:05.235 --> 15:07.303
that trials
are about truth.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.806
And truth requires openness.

15:12.209 --> 15:14.343
Rest assured, Jessica,

15:14.411 --> 15:17.880
those who have done wrong
will get what's coming to them.

15:27.829 --> 15:30.131
There's one thing
I'm not clear on.

15:30.198 --> 15:31.499
Go through
the security footage

15:31.566 --> 15:33.267
and count the number
of drinks Keith had.

15:33.335 --> 15:36.771
We establish his state of mind,
then file a motion to dismiss.

15:36.838 --> 15:38.773
How hard is that?
Not the thing I'm unclear on.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.808
I don't have time to explain
where babies come from.

15:40.876 --> 15:42.610
How exactly did you
get this footage?

15:42.677 --> 15:43.778
Head of security
owed me one.

15:43.845 --> 15:45.279
Which brings me
to my next question:

15:45.347 --> 15:47.982
Everyone always owes you one,
but Keith says you owe him one.

15:48.049 --> 15:49.517
Why?
Why don't you just ask him?

15:49.584 --> 15:51.452
- I did. He wouldn't tell me.
- Exactly.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.521
Because if he had,
I wouldn't owe him one anymore.

15:53.588 --> 15:56.023
Mr. Specter, I'm Cameron,
your new assistant.

15:56.091 --> 15:57.691
- Where are my--
- Messages.

15:57.759 --> 15:59.794
Urgent to normal,
top to bottom.

15:59.861 --> 16:01.529
I also took it upon myself
to fan the folders

16:01.596 --> 16:03.364
on your desk
in alphabetical order.

16:03.431 --> 16:04.698
Wow, look at that, Harvey.

16:04.766 --> 16:06.634
He fanned your folders
in an order of some sort.

16:06.701 --> 16:08.602
I also reorganized
your filing system

16:08.670 --> 16:09.970
and redid your calendar.

16:10.038 --> 16:12.206
Ha, that is not going
to be a problem at all

16:12.274 --> 16:14.542
because Harvey loves change.

16:14.609 --> 16:18.279
- It was a train wreck.
- Yep.

16:20.816 --> 16:22.883
He's in mourning
over your predecessor.

16:22.951 --> 16:24.885
Her filing system,
her calendar--

16:24.953 --> 16:26.120
it's probably best
if nothing else

16:26.188 --> 16:27.688
is different in there
this morning, okay?

16:27.756 --> 16:31.625
- Uh-oh.
- Mike...

16:31.693 --> 16:33.260
Yeah.

16:33.328 --> 16:34.695
You might want
to take an early lunch.

16:34.763 --> 16:37.798
Yeah.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.266
Oh, wow.

16:39.334 --> 16:42.236
Harold, can I get the rest
of the files on the ballet case?

16:42.304 --> 16:43.437
Sure, let me
grab them for you.

16:43.505 --> 16:45.606
Thank you.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.374
What is it about ballet?

16:47.442 --> 16:49.276
I just--I don't get it,
you know?

16:49.344 --> 16:53.047
There's no words,
there's no story,

16:53.114 --> 16:56.717
there's no action.
It's just all...

16:56.785 --> 17:00.788
and...

17:00.856 --> 17:03.324
and like...I don't...

17:04.593 --> 17:06.260
Please tell me
that Louis isn't behind me.

17:06.328 --> 17:07.828
Louis isn't behind you.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.097
Hi.
Hi.

17:10.165 --> 17:14.468
Penelope Cruz, Zoe Saldana,
Audrey Hepburn--

17:14.536 --> 17:15.736
what do they
all have in common?

17:15.804 --> 17:18.439
- They're all hot?
- No, dumbass.

17:18.506 --> 17:21.842
They all owe
their success to ballet

17:21.910 --> 17:25.145
because it gives them
discipline and grace,

17:25.213 --> 17:26.747
it embodies our emotions,

17:26.815 --> 17:30.251
it's breathtaking in its beauty,
and most importantly,

17:30.318 --> 17:32.353
it expresses what cannot
be put into words.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.754
You want
to get ahead here, Harold?

17:33.822 --> 17:35.656
Take ballet,
because right now,

17:35.724 --> 17:37.558
the only thing
that's breathtaking about you

17:37.626 --> 17:39.927
can easily be put
into words: Nothing.

17:39.995 --> 17:42.263
Now releve your ass
back to work.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.468
I need everything you got for me
first thing tomorrow.

17:47.535 --> 17:49.470
- I'm on it.
- Good.

17:52.173 --> 17:55.476
Yes, immediately.
Thank you.

17:55.543 --> 17:57.811
What happened
with Judge Follman?

17:57.879 --> 17:59.380
There might
be a slight problem.

17:59.447 --> 18:00.547
What did you do?

18:00.615 --> 18:01.882
Why do you assume
I did something?

18:01.950 --> 18:03.150
- What did you do?
- There was a prank.

18:03.218 --> 18:04.551
How bad was it?

18:04.619 --> 18:06.687
We went to law school
together, and I got her drunk.

18:06.755 --> 18:08.222
- So?
- So she woke up in front of

18:08.290 --> 18:09.790
the entire con law class.

18:09.858 --> 18:11.892
- It's recoverable.
- She might have been naked.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.160
- "Might have"?
- Was.

18:13.228 --> 18:15.062
- We're screwed.
- Come on, Harvey.

18:15.130 --> 18:17.865
She was uptight.
I just straightened her out.

18:17.933 --> 18:19.199
It's what you do
with uptight people.

18:19.267 --> 18:21.001
Why don't you
ever do that to Louis?

18:21.069 --> 18:24.004
I did.

18:24.072 --> 18:27.141
That was you?
He blamed me.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.043
You can be uptight
sometimes too.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.611
That's why I let him
think it was you.

18:30.679 --> 18:32.813
- Told him it was me.
- That's what I said.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.551
- It's okay, I deserved it.
- What?

18:37.619 --> 18:38.852
Do you remember
when he was so mad

18:38.920 --> 18:40.821
when his cat peed
in the corner of his office?

18:40.889 --> 18:42.823
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't his cat.

18:46.761 --> 18:49.763
You know,
this is no joke.

18:49.831 --> 18:52.733
We're being sued.
I'm in trouble.

18:52.801 --> 18:54.935
- I know.
- What are you gonna do?

18:55.003 --> 18:59.573
I'm gonna get her
off our case.

19:24.299 --> 19:26.133
Hey.

19:26.201 --> 19:28.002
You're studying up
to break the house?

19:28.069 --> 19:29.403
Counting drinks.

19:29.471 --> 19:31.205
Don't most people
count cards?

19:31.272 --> 19:32.639
It's a thing.

19:32.707 --> 19:34.775
Ah! Right there.
You see that?

19:34.843 --> 19:35.876
Drink number 15.

19:35.944 --> 19:38.278
Your client?
That's awful.

19:38.346 --> 19:39.346
No, no, no,
it's good.

19:39.414 --> 19:40.447
We're even
putting him in rehab

19:40.515 --> 19:41.715
to help
nullify his contract.

19:41.783 --> 19:42.883
Touching.

19:42.951 --> 19:45.586
Harvey truly cares
about his clients.

19:45.653 --> 19:46.854
Uhuhuh, my idea.

19:46.921 --> 19:49.123
Well, you're really
coming along.

19:49.190 --> 19:51.358
What are you
doing here so late?

19:51.426 --> 19:52.593
Working with Louis.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.996
I'm sorry?
With Louis?

19:56.064 --> 19:57.765
Associate work.

19:57.832 --> 20:02.236
He, um...he replaced
Harold with me.

20:03.671 --> 20:06.340
Good for you.

20:06.408 --> 20:08.542
Looks like you're
really coming along.

20:08.610 --> 20:11.879
Thank you, Mike.

20:18.219 --> 20:20.687
And that was
the last drink of the night.

20:20.755 --> 20:23.157
16 drinks in 11 hours

20:23.224 --> 20:24.892
in a 180-pound man,

20:24.959 --> 20:27.428
and that's a blood
alcohol level of .16%,

20:27.495 --> 20:29.196
double the legal limit.

20:29.264 --> 20:31.565
Your Honor, you've heard
the expression "beer goggles."

20:31.633 --> 20:34.401
Well, when my client was looking
at that dirty napkin,

20:34.469 --> 20:36.970
all he saw
was Angelina Jolie.

20:37.038 --> 20:40.574
Your Honor, my client
entered into a contract

20:40.642 --> 20:41.842
with a man that was
aware enough to realize

20:41.910 --> 20:43.410
that he had a good hand,

20:43.478 --> 20:45.512
aware enough
to ask for help,

20:45.580 --> 20:47.014
aware enough to sign
a piece of paper

20:47.082 --> 20:49.850
for the sole purpose of winning
a large pot of money,

20:49.918 --> 20:51.318
and now he's mad
he lost.

20:51.386 --> 20:53.787
Our client has
a history of drinking

20:53.855 --> 20:55.556
and has agreed
to be placed into rehab.

20:55.623 --> 20:57.958
That has nothing
to do with this.

20:58.026 --> 20:59.560
That tape clearly shows
that Keith didn't

20:59.627 --> 21:02.062
make any of those decisions
while he was sober.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.965
Maybe not.
But you did.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.333
What?

21:06.401 --> 21:07.868
The next morning,
you came to my client

21:07.936 --> 21:10.170
and offered to pay him what
you'd owed him if you'd won.

21:10.238 --> 21:11.271
I don't care
what he says

21:11.339 --> 21:12.873
about his client's
state of mind,

21:12.941 --> 21:15.409
he was stone-cold sober.
Which clearly demonstrates

21:15.477 --> 21:17.644
they were perfectly happy
with the terms of the contract.

21:17.712 --> 21:19.613
Your Honor,
those were settlement talks,

21:19.681 --> 21:21.915
not subject
to disclosure here.

21:21.983 --> 21:23.484
Mr. Specter,
you're asking me

21:23.551 --> 21:25.919
to dismiss this contract
without a trial.

21:25.987 --> 21:28.755
Let's have it.

21:28.823 --> 21:31.458
Yes, I made an offer.

21:31.526 --> 21:34.695
Then I'm sorry, counselor,
I'm not ruling for dismissal.

21:34.762 --> 21:36.797
This goes forward
to trial.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.402
This guy is
pissing me off.

21:48.469 --> 21:50.604
Yeah, he's really good.
Kind of inspiring, actually.

21:50.672 --> 21:51.805
You trying
to piss me off more?

21:51.873 --> 21:54.274
Yeah, it focuses you.
It's what you do to me.

21:54.342 --> 21:55.442
Yeah, I do that
because you don't have

21:55.510 --> 21:57.878
a natural killer instinct.
Yes, I do.

21:57.946 --> 21:59.379
Good, because
I need you to use it.

21:59.447 --> 22:00.681
See what I did there?

22:00.748 --> 22:02.049
Yeah.
What's our end game?

22:02.116 --> 22:03.951
Interim control
of the company.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.819
Possession is
9/10 of the law.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.621
Whoever is in control
in the interim

22:07.689 --> 22:09.389
is likely to be
in control in the end.

22:09.457 --> 22:10.457
Plus, if we're
in the driver's seat,

22:10.525 --> 22:11.959
we can drag
this trial out forever.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.727
And we can do anything
we want in the meantime.

22:13.795 --> 22:14.995
By the time
this is over,

22:15.063 --> 22:17.264
he won't even get back
his $3 million in chips.

22:17.332 --> 22:18.365
What do you
need me to do?

22:18.433 --> 22:19.599
Find out everything
there is to know

22:19.667 --> 22:20.767
about this Tommy guy

22:20.835 --> 22:22.502
and get his ass in here
for a deposition.

22:22.570 --> 22:25.706
On it.

22:25.773 --> 22:27.808
Louis,
I finished.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.977
You were here all night?

22:30.044 --> 22:31.445
You said you wanted everything
by this morning,

22:31.512 --> 22:33.680
so here's everything
on the lease agreements

22:33.748 --> 22:35.148
and all of the financials.

22:35.216 --> 22:37.484
Oh, no, Sergei waltzed me
through the financials earlier.

22:37.552 --> 22:38.885
Did you know that
he danced with Nureyev?

22:38.953 --> 22:41.888
I did.
Um, also...

22:41.956 --> 22:44.858
I found this.

22:46.427 --> 22:49.997
Lead paint?

22:50.064 --> 22:52.666
Okay, this is...
excellent.

22:52.734 --> 22:54.768
- You can use it?
- "Use it"?

22:54.836 --> 22:58.038
We are gonna pas de deux
all over their asses with it.

22:58.106 --> 23:00.040
"We"?

23:03.911 --> 23:06.546
- Get out.
- Okay.

23:19.494 --> 23:21.561
Here to buy me
a drink?

23:21.629 --> 23:23.363
That didn't go so well
for me last time.

23:23.431 --> 23:26.566
No. No, I'm here
same as everyone else,

23:26.634 --> 23:29.369
to contribute to
your reelection campaign.

23:29.437 --> 23:30.637
Actually, I already did.

23:30.705 --> 23:33.607
Pearson Hardman is
now a platinum-level donor.

23:33.674 --> 23:35.976
Go, Follman.

23:36.044 --> 23:37.744
I know
what you're doing.

23:37.812 --> 23:39.479
Of course, you don't have
to disclose this,

23:39.547 --> 23:40.814
and neither do we,

23:40.882 --> 23:44.684
but I am of the opinion
that elections are about truth,

23:44.752 --> 23:46.920
and truth
requires openness.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.724
You think
you can get me to recuse

23:50.792 --> 23:52.726
by implying
a conflict of interest?

23:52.794 --> 23:54.094
You know,
I hadn't thought of that.

23:54.162 --> 23:55.996
I'll simply
return the money.

23:56.064 --> 23:57.531
That is certainly
your prerogative.

23:57.598 --> 24:01.401
But it could look like
you took money for favors

24:01.469 --> 24:03.770
and then got scared.

24:03.838 --> 24:05.906
No one forced liquor
down your throat, Ella.

24:05.973 --> 24:09.042
You got drunk,
we played a bad joke,

24:09.110 --> 24:11.411
but that was
a long time ago.

24:11.479 --> 24:14.047
You know, a man's reputation
is at stake,

24:14.115 --> 24:17.184
and I'm not
joking with you now.

24:17.251 --> 24:19.686
Cheers.

24:24.525 --> 24:27.761
Lastly, section 5,
page 30 states

24:27.829 --> 24:29.096
that the Royal Hall
is responsible

24:29.163 --> 24:31.298
for all maintenance and repairs
of the rehearsal space.

24:31.365 --> 24:32.966
I'm aware of what
the lease says, Mr. Litt,

24:33.034 --> 24:34.267
having drafted it myself.

24:34.335 --> 24:35.735
Okay, well, then
how do you explain this?

24:35.803 --> 24:37.304
The Royal Hall's
knowing failure to fix

24:37.371 --> 24:40.574
the air conditioning system
has created a toxic environment.

24:40.641 --> 24:41.975
Lead-based paint.

24:42.043 --> 24:44.811
See, your disregard
for the safety of your charges

24:44.879 --> 24:47.114
takes it from a tenant dispute
to a criminal action,

24:47.181 --> 24:48.248
a fact that
I will happily bring

24:48.316 --> 24:49.449
to the attention
of the district attorney

24:49.517 --> 24:51.451
unless repairs
are made yesterday.

24:51.519 --> 24:53.920
Then you'll be exposing
the ballet itself

24:53.988 --> 24:56.590
because the terms require
they cover all repairs

24:56.657 --> 25:00.494
from a special fund they
stopped paying into a year ago.

25:00.561 --> 25:02.295
No, no, no, no, payments have
been going out every month.

25:02.363 --> 25:03.864
Then perhaps
you should figure out

25:03.931 --> 25:07.434
where they've been going in
because it's not here.

25:09.270 --> 25:10.770
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

25:10.838 --> 25:12.639
Our financial records say--
Mr. Litt,

25:12.707 --> 25:14.207
we were willing
to look the other way,

25:14.275 --> 25:16.643
but since you have come in here
and threatened me,

25:16.711 --> 25:19.546
I'm going to take
legal action of my own.

25:19.614 --> 25:21.548
We'll be filing
for eviction.

25:21.616 --> 25:23.550
It's time
the ballet moves on.

25:33.094 --> 25:35.896
Can you tell me what
this is exactly, Mr. Walsh?

25:35.963 --> 25:37.164
I don't know.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.498
If I told you
it was a yaw drive,

25:38.566 --> 25:41.134
would that mean
anything to you?

25:41.202 --> 25:44.538
A yaw drive keeps the rotor
facing the right way,

25:44.605 --> 25:46.106
even when
the wind direction changes.

25:46.174 --> 25:49.442
If you have a problem with this,
you're not getting any power.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.244
I'm sorry, where exactly
did you study engineering?

25:51.312 --> 25:52.779
I didn't.

25:52.847 --> 25:55.415
But you're suggesting that
you can run an energy company.

25:55.483 --> 25:57.017
My client's
gonna be running it,

25:57.084 --> 25:58.685
not designing parts.

25:58.753 --> 26:00.754
Well, does your client
have any idea

26:00.821 --> 26:05.158
how to protect the company
from the numerous allegations

26:05.226 --> 26:06.927
made by the Jarvis
Homeowners Association?

26:06.994 --> 26:08.428
Are you even
aware of these allegations?

26:08.496 --> 26:10.197
I haven't taken over
the company yet, Mr. Specter.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.132
Well, let me explain
something to you.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.501
My client's company
needs to remain viable

26:14.569 --> 26:15.936
during the course
of this trial,

26:16.003 --> 26:19.039
and these allegations are
a threat to its very existence.

26:19.106 --> 26:21.007
And I don't think someone
who doesn't know the difference

26:21.075 --> 26:23.210
between a yaw drive
and a carburetor

26:23.277 --> 26:25.378
is the man for the job.
He's right.

26:25.446 --> 26:27.547
I don't know
anything about energy.

26:27.615 --> 26:29.015
And I'll tell you
something else:

26:29.083 --> 26:32.018
I also know very little
about ice cream.

26:32.086 --> 26:34.087
Yeah, I mean,
I enjoy vanilla,

26:34.155 --> 26:35.989
but beyond that,
nothing.

26:36.057 --> 26:37.891
Vanilla...
could've guessed.

26:37.959 --> 26:39.960
I assume
you have a point.

26:40.027 --> 26:41.595
I don't know anything
about any of the companies

26:41.662 --> 26:42.862
that I've turned around.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.899
But I don't have to
because I hire experts

26:45.967 --> 26:47.968
to advise me
on operating them.

26:48.035 --> 26:50.470
And the one thing all
these experts have in common

26:50.538 --> 26:52.539
is that none of them
has a drinking problem.

26:52.607 --> 26:54.541
- Your Honor--
- He raised the issue.

26:54.609 --> 26:56.810
His client--
and I quote--

26:56.877 --> 26:59.145
"has a history of drinking"
and was, in fact,

26:59.213 --> 27:01.881
so intoxicated that night
that his own lawyers

27:01.949 --> 27:04.884
had to place him to rehab.
He disputed that.

27:04.952 --> 27:06.553
That is not
the subject of this hearing.

27:06.621 --> 27:08.488
- Your Honor, he's trying to--
- I know what he's trying to do.

27:08.556 --> 27:10.523
He's using
your words against you.

27:10.591 --> 27:12.859
But they are your words,
Mr. Specter.

27:12.927 --> 27:16.429
The issue of the napkin contract
will be heard at trial,

27:16.497 --> 27:19.266
but in the interim,
Thomas Walsh

27:19.333 --> 27:22.469
will assume control
of the company.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.206
Thank you.

27:34.231 --> 27:35.504
This is just wrong.

27:35.505 --> 27:37.006
I know, this ruling
doesn't make any sense.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.774
No, I meant this.

27:38.842 --> 27:40.609
- The hot dog is wrong?
- It's a truck.

27:40.677 --> 27:41.944
This is New York.

27:42.012 --> 27:45.448
I want a cart, a vendor,
or a vague sense of danger,

27:45.515 --> 27:47.349
that the hot dog might
be made of anything.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.784
Okay, well, I think
I saw some cats

27:48.852 --> 27:49.985
lurking out
behind the truck.

27:50.053 --> 27:53.656
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

27:53.724 --> 27:55.458
Not so bad.
All right, street meat,

27:55.525 --> 27:56.592
you wanna talk
about what just happened?

27:56.660 --> 27:57.860
No, I don't.

27:57.928 --> 27:59.462
You said whoever's in control
in the interim--

27:59.529 --> 28:01.931
- I know what I said.
- So what's the other 1/10?

28:01.998 --> 28:03.199
What are you
talking about?

28:03.266 --> 28:04.900
You said possession
is 9/10 of the law.

28:04.968 --> 28:07.169
So I figure we need
the other 1/10, right?

28:07.237 --> 28:09.071
- We're not gonna win this.
- What?

28:09.139 --> 28:11.040
- We don't have him.
- It's a 10% chance,

28:11.108 --> 28:13.042
but it's still a chance.
I mean, the odds are--

28:13.110 --> 28:14.043
I'm not talking
about the odds,

28:14.111 --> 28:15.745
I'm talking about the man.

28:15.812 --> 28:16.946
Wow, I've never
heard you say

28:17.013 --> 28:18.614
another lawyer's
better than you before.

28:18.682 --> 28:20.483
He's not,
he's just got a better hand,

28:20.550 --> 28:23.085
and he knows it.

28:23.153 --> 28:25.421
- What if we play a new hand?
- I'm listening.

28:25.489 --> 28:27.323
You're always talking
about this gun

28:27.390 --> 28:29.692
being pointed
at your head.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.761
What if we take off
our jacket

28:31.828 --> 28:34.964
and show them that we have
a bomb strapped to our chest?

28:35.031 --> 28:37.166
It's a metaphor,
metaphor.

28:44.474 --> 28:47.676
- You wanted to see me?
- It was Sergei.

28:47.744 --> 28:49.545
He lied to me.

28:49.613 --> 28:52.014
The money went
into his account.

28:52.082 --> 28:53.549
There's no way
that you could have--

28:53.617 --> 28:57.086
What, known?
It's my job to know.

28:57.154 --> 29:00.790
God, I never take anyone
at their word.

29:00.857 --> 29:02.525
You know I was
eight years old

29:02.592 --> 29:04.160
when I saw him perform
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>

29:04.227 --> 29:06.662
Eight.

29:06.730 --> 29:10.432
Everybody else was into sports,
and I was this rebel,

29:10.500 --> 29:12.568
gliding down my own path.

29:12.636 --> 29:14.003
He inspired me.

29:14.070 --> 29:15.871
That's why I'm
so light on my feet.

29:15.939 --> 29:17.439
I just can't do it to him.

29:17.507 --> 29:18.974
I cannot do it
to him, Rachel.

29:19.042 --> 29:20.643
He <i>is</i> the ballet.

29:20.710 --> 29:23.646
No, the ballet
is bigger than Sergei.

29:26.516 --> 29:29.585
It embodies
our emotions,

29:29.653 --> 29:32.755
it is breathtaking
in its beauty,

29:32.823 --> 29:34.924
and most importantly,

29:34.991 --> 29:37.960
it expresses what cannot
be put into words.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.930
- Yes, but--
- No buts.

29:40.997 --> 29:44.166
The Louis I know wouldn't be
defeated by something like this.

29:44.234 --> 29:47.670
He is ruthless.
He is mean.

29:47.737 --> 29:50.973
And if someone wronged him,
he wouldn't hesitate

29:51.041 --> 29:53.976
to tear them apart
limb from limb.

30:03.653 --> 30:05.154
You ruined everything.
I took your help,

30:05.222 --> 30:06.188
and now we're evicted!
I want to--

30:06.256 --> 30:07.723
Shut up, Sergei.

30:07.791 --> 30:10.092
- How dare you?
- Me?

30:10.160 --> 30:13.195
You, you brought disgrace
on my beloved ballet.

30:13.263 --> 30:15.831
- I <i>am</i> the ballet.
- You were the ballet.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.032
And now you're done,

30:17.100 --> 30:18.868
and the Royal Hall,
they've been paid.

30:18.935 --> 30:20.936
How?

30:21.004 --> 30:22.204
I reorganized accounts,
moved money.

30:22.272 --> 30:23.505
I did what I do.

30:23.573 --> 30:25.374
I showed them how
they can pay for everything

30:25.442 --> 30:28.410
by eliminating
your bloated salary.

30:30.513 --> 30:31.847
Well,

30:31.915 --> 30:33.315
the board would never agree,
so it's ridiculous.

30:33.383 --> 30:35.584
Oh, please, stop.
It's why they're here, Sergei.

30:35.652 --> 30:37.152
This isn't
about the eviction.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.621
They know what you've done.

30:38.688 --> 30:40.322
They want to see your face
when they tell you you're fired.

30:40.390 --> 30:44.059
But I'm giving you one chance
to avoid scandal.

30:44.127 --> 30:45.728
My leaving
is a scandal.

30:45.795 --> 30:47.096
Your leaving
is a gift.

30:47.163 --> 30:48.931
Take it before
I change my mind.

30:59.709 --> 31:01.443
You wanted
to see me?

31:01.511 --> 31:04.213
That was
a good speech.

31:06.082 --> 31:07.750
Got me right here.

31:07.817 --> 31:10.653
The only thing is,
you said, <i>"we</i> played a joke."

31:10.720 --> 31:13.222
There was no "we."
It was you.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.758
You targeted me.
What do you want me to say?

31:15.825 --> 31:20.496
I was young, I was stupid,
and I'm sorry.

31:20.563 --> 31:23.766
You were young and smart,

31:23.833 --> 31:25.968
and I don't believe
you're sorry for a second

31:26.036 --> 31:29.505
because it was no accident
that the classroom you chose

31:29.572 --> 31:31.006
belonged to the Professor

31:31.074 --> 31:32.808
who was conducting
the interviews

31:32.876 --> 31:35.044
for the job
we both wanted.

31:36.846 --> 31:39.915
- I had no idea.
- You sabotaged me.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.451
There were
dozens of applicants.

31:42.519 --> 31:44.119
No, we both know
it was you or me.

31:44.187 --> 31:46.522
- I didn't know that he--
- Objection.

31:46.589 --> 31:49.458
Bullshit.

31:49.526 --> 31:51.694
What do you want, Ella?

31:51.761 --> 31:54.830
I want to recuse myself.

31:54.898 --> 31:57.266
On one condition:

31:59.336 --> 32:01.437
Admit you know
what you did.

32:06.443 --> 32:08.610
I wanted that job.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.512
I know what I did.

32:10.580 --> 32:14.383
I'm not sorry
I did it.

32:14.451 --> 32:17.786
And I'd do it again.

32:28.531 --> 32:29.531
You look confused.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.667
I am.

32:31.735 --> 32:34.003
About what?

32:34.070 --> 32:37.473
I...like Louis.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.508
Trust me, I've been there.

32:39.576 --> 32:43.078
Doesn't last.

32:43.146 --> 32:46.081
Oh, my God.
Is that--

32:48.385 --> 32:50.119
is that Louis' dictaphone?

32:50.186 --> 32:51.754
Oh, yeah, I needed it

32:51.821 --> 32:54.089
to transcribe the notes
for the ballet case.

32:54.157 --> 32:55.424
Do you have any idea
what this means?

32:55.492 --> 32:59.395
Rachel, this is a window
into the mind of Louis Litt.

32:59.462 --> 33:01.397
It's a dictaphone.

33:01.464 --> 33:03.032
That he treats
like his best friend.

33:03.099 --> 33:04.566
- Mike.
- Ahh--come on, gotta try it.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.936
Goal number seven:
Perfect the British accent.

33:08.004 --> 33:09.938
Hey, top of the morning,
mate.

33:10.006 --> 33:11.473
Would ya like
some tea and crumpets?

33:11.541 --> 33:12.641
- Yes!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:12.709 --> 33:14.143
We really--
we really shouldn't.

33:14.210 --> 33:16.278
Oh, no, but I think
we really, really should.

33:16.346 --> 33:18.881
Come up with a catchphrase.
Injunct this.

33:18.948 --> 33:20.482
Hey, Harold,
injunct this.

33:20.550 --> 33:22.084
This is insane.

33:22.152 --> 33:23.485
Insanely awesome.

33:23.553 --> 33:24.853
You just got Litt up.

33:24.921 --> 33:27.423
Excuse me, Miss Zane,
you just got Litt up.

33:27.490 --> 33:30.259
- Oh, no, Rachel.
- No, no, no! Enough.

33:30.326 --> 33:32.194
- No, you just got Litt up.
- I feel dirty.

33:32.262 --> 33:33.896
Wait, wait,
this is a gold mine.

33:33.963 --> 33:35.998
One more, come on.

33:36.066 --> 33:38.267
They're settling?
You wanted that?

33:38.334 --> 33:40.102
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

33:40.170 --> 33:41.937
CM plays what they should have
in the first place,

33:42.005 --> 33:43.372
and the suit
against us goes away.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.107
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

33:45.175 --> 33:48.277
Where the hell is Donna?

33:48.344 --> 33:51.013
He recorded us.

33:51.081 --> 33:52.714
He must have planted this
in Harvey's office.

33:52.782 --> 33:55.384
No, th--
that's horrible.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.019
- That's why he turned on me.
- Wait a minute.

33:57.087 --> 33:58.487
What are you going to do?
I don't know.

33:58.555 --> 34:01.523
But if I tell Harvey about this,
he is gonna kill Louis.

34:03.893 --> 34:05.094
Come on, let's go.
They're in the conference room.

34:05.161 --> 34:06.962
- Okay.
- Everything all right?

34:07.030 --> 34:08.764
Uh, yeah, no.

34:08.831 --> 34:10.232
Did you get
that power of attorney?

34:10.300 --> 34:12.034
Yeah. Let's go
set off that bomb.

34:12.101 --> 34:14.036
Thanks.

34:19.109 --> 34:21.643
By the way, where did you
find that yaw drive anyway?

34:21.710 --> 34:25.481
Pulled it out
of the back of a photocopier.

34:25.547 --> 34:28.283
Gentlemen, as you are
now in control of the company,

34:28.351 --> 34:30.485
we thought it best to bring
a problem to your attention.

34:30.553 --> 34:32.387
How selfless of you.

34:32.455 --> 34:33.889
These are amended copies
of the allegations

34:33.956 --> 34:36.358
against your company by the
Jarvis Homeowners Association.

34:36.426 --> 34:38.893
Nice try.
I looked into those allegations.

34:38.962 --> 34:41.396
Not a single expert has backed
one of their claims.

34:41.464 --> 34:43.699
- Well, one has now.
- Keith Hoyt.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.501
Who better to speak
to the harmful effects

34:45.568 --> 34:48.737
than the man who designed
the wind farm himself?

34:48.804 --> 34:50.539
No, no, if he
goes through with this,

34:50.607 --> 34:51.974
that company
goes out of business.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.641
There's no way he kills
his own company.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.210
You're right,
he wouldn't.

34:55.277 --> 34:58.013
But I would,
and as you pointed out,

34:58.081 --> 35:00.315
Keith's judgment
has been impaired lately,

35:00.383 --> 35:01.483
so I convinced him
to let me

35:01.551 --> 35:03.218
make the decisions
going forward.

35:03.286 --> 35:05.053
I now have
power of attorney,

35:05.121 --> 35:07.122
and I'd rather see
this company worth nothing

35:07.190 --> 35:10.659
than let you have it.

35:10.727 --> 35:12.728
- This is bullshit.
- Let him finish.

35:12.795 --> 35:15.664
Something's coming.

35:15.732 --> 35:17.866
We have
three choices here.

35:17.934 --> 35:21.069
We move forward with the suit--
lose-lose--

35:21.137 --> 35:24.506
we can give you your money back,
plus the $500,000,

35:24.574 --> 35:28.177
or you and I
can play poker for it.

35:28.244 --> 35:30.179
And I'm not giving you
your money back.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.253
Are you crazy?

35:38.321 --> 35:40.155
You're gonna gamble
a man's company?

35:40.223 --> 35:42.624
What, no, you're gonna
gamble for $30 million?

35:42.692 --> 35:44.159
It was your idea.

35:44.227 --> 35:46.428
No, it was my idea
to make him take the $500,000.

35:46.495 --> 35:49.297
But it's not $500,000,
it's $3.5 million.

35:49.365 --> 35:51.233
Why give him that when
I could take it for free?

35:52.868 --> 35:55.303
Okay.

35:55.371 --> 35:57.105
But let me take it.

35:57.173 --> 35:59.641
What? A minute ago,
you were ready to fold.

35:59.709 --> 36:01.376
What are you gonna do
if he goes all in?

36:01.444 --> 36:02.744
Harvey, I know
the odds of every card

36:02.812 --> 36:04.279
in every hand
before it's even dealt.

36:04.347 --> 36:06.581
Pick a card in your mind,
any card.

36:06.649 --> 36:09.050
Wh

36:09.118 --> 36:11.253
Okay, what, now you're gonna
tell me what the card is?

36:11.320 --> 36:12.520
I'm gonna tell you
what it isn't.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.956
It's not one of
the 52 cards in a deck

36:15.024 --> 36:16.524
because you think
you're smarter than me.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.193
It's a baseball card

36:18.261 --> 36:22.597
or football card or...

36:22.665 --> 36:25.634
It's the joker.

36:25.701 --> 36:27.969
I told you this before.
I'm gonna tell you again.

36:28.037 --> 36:31.273
I don't play the odds.
I play the man.

36:31.340 --> 36:33.441
Well, let me
tell you one thing.

36:33.509 --> 36:36.311
- What?
- Louis bugged your office.

36:36.379 --> 36:39.014
He heard our whole conversation
about Tanner's lawsuit,

36:39.081 --> 36:40.448
and then he ran,
and he told Hardman.

36:40.516 --> 36:43.018
You just saying that
to make me mad, so I can focus?

36:48.924 --> 36:50.592
You're not the only one
who can play the man.

37:00.903 --> 37:03.438
You really think
you can handle me?

37:03.506 --> 37:05.273
Oh, I think
I'll be just fine.

37:05.341 --> 37:07.208
'Cause this isn't
Sunday afternoon bridge

37:07.276 --> 37:09.077
with your grandmother.

37:09.145 --> 37:10.945
I don't see how that's
an insult to a person.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.851
I'll just keep dealing.

37:34.870 --> 37:37.972
Look, we're supposed to play
until one of us is busted,

37:38.040 --> 37:41.743
even if it takes all night,
but you know what?

37:41.811 --> 37:44.779
I don't have all night.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.881
Who's the grandmother now?

37:46.949 --> 37:48.883
Better.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.955
He can't help you.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.523
But I do know why
you're looking to him.

37:55.591 --> 37:57.892
You see,
I looked into you.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.195
You say
you're a self-made man.

38:00.262 --> 38:02.564
Your ex-wife
had a different story

38:02.631 --> 38:04.466
when she told me
why she left you.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.201
She said you had
a chip on your shoulder

38:06.268 --> 38:08.436
because everything you ever got
came from daddy.

38:08.504 --> 38:10.905
Now, you may not think
this is true anymore.

38:10.973 --> 38:12.807
You said yourself,
you're not an expert.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.776
But you hire them
to advise you,

38:14.844 --> 38:17.746
run your companies,
and fight your battles.

38:17.813 --> 38:22.183
Tonight, it's you, me,
and that stack of chips.

38:22.251 --> 38:24.185
Let's play.

38:46.942 --> 38:48.576
You think you can
bait me into calling you

38:48.644 --> 38:51.579
when you got me beat?

38:55.684 --> 38:57.318
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

38:57.386 --> 39:01.790
You're right, Tommy,
I do have you beat.

39:01.857 --> 39:04.392
But these shity cards,

39:04.460 --> 39:07.729
they don't have
anything to do with it.

39:13.569 --> 39:15.370
After that, he was on tilt,
never recovered.

39:15.438 --> 39:16.871
Took me 20 minutes
to bust him.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.106
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

39:18.174 --> 39:19.374
How fast did you
want me to beat him?

39:19.442 --> 39:20.809
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

39:20.876 --> 39:22.844
You're out of control.
I'm fine.

39:22.912 --> 39:25.113
Fine? Let me
connect the dots for you.

39:25.181 --> 39:26.648
Donna's gone.

39:26.715 --> 39:28.850
You took Mike
to a casino,

39:28.918 --> 39:30.385
and two days later,
you're gambling

39:30.453 --> 39:33.121
with a client's
$30 million company.

39:33.189 --> 39:34.622
I wasn't gambling,
I was playing poker.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.258
- Harvey, save it.
- Save it?

39:37.326 --> 39:39.594
Gambling is what you do when
you're playing against the house

39:39.662 --> 39:40.862
and hoping to get Blackjack.

39:40.930 --> 39:42.297
I'm playing
against people,

39:42.364 --> 39:44.165
and against people,
I win.

39:44.233 --> 39:46.067
In a back room card game,
that might be true,

39:46.135 --> 39:48.603
but you didn't know
anything about this guy.

39:48.671 --> 39:50.338
He could've been Phil Ivey
for all you know.

39:50.406 --> 39:52.207
You're gonna beat
Phil Ivey?

39:52.274 --> 39:53.808
No, I did know,
and I was right.

39:53.876 --> 39:55.176
This time.

39:55.244 --> 39:56.911
But you know
what else gambling

39:56.979 --> 39:59.447
and what you did
have in common?

39:59.515 --> 40:02.217
This.

40:02.284 --> 40:03.685
You think
I didn't remember

40:03.752 --> 40:07.455
your "Life is this,
and I like this" speech?

40:07.523 --> 40:09.290
When you get that from your job,
it's one thing,

40:09.358 --> 40:11.426
but then you start chasing it.
No, I wasn't chasing it.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.027
We were going
to lose this in court.

40:13.095 --> 40:15.430
- Then lose.
- No! I am not--

40:15.498 --> 40:19.467
You're not what?
A human being?

40:19.535 --> 40:22.537
We're people,
and sometimes we lose.

40:22.605 --> 40:23.805
Sometimes?

40:23.873 --> 40:25.306
Look, I don't
know about you,

40:25.374 --> 40:27.442
but I feel like that's
all we've been doing lately.

40:27.510 --> 40:31.045
Hardman's back, Donna's gone,
we're being sued--

40:31.113 --> 40:33.648
I mean, we're fighting
for our goddamn lives here.

40:33.716 --> 40:36.951
I just had a huge win,
and I am not in the mood to hear

40:37.019 --> 40:40.622
why it might have
turned out as a loss.

40:40.689 --> 40:44.626
Harvey...

40:44.693 --> 40:48.329
you're right.

40:48.397 --> 40:50.632
We are being sued,

40:50.699 --> 40:52.567
and our backs
are against the wall,

40:52.635 --> 40:55.036
and I need to know

40:55.104 --> 40:57.372
that this bullshit
is out of your system

40:57.439 --> 40:59.674
and that you can focus.

40:59.742 --> 41:01.376
Can you do that?

41:03.178 --> 41:05.947
I'm focused.

41:21.163 --> 41:22.363
I was--

41:22.431 --> 41:24.399
I don't give a shit
what you were doing.

41:24.466 --> 41:25.833
You know, Harvey, you can
make fun of me all you want,

41:25.901 --> 41:27.969
but watch your tone.

41:32.308 --> 41:36.077
What the hell
is that?

41:36.145 --> 41:38.580
That's not yours.

41:38.647 --> 41:42.216
This is a violation
of my privacy.

41:42.284 --> 41:43.885
You know what,
I have a right to know

41:43.953 --> 41:46.854
what's going on at this firm,
just as much as you.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.624
Okay.
Did you tell Jessica?

41:49.692 --> 41:51.259
There's gonna
come a day, Louis,

41:51.327 --> 41:52.860
when I need
something from you,

41:52.928 --> 41:56.898
and when I do, you're gonna
remember that I let this pass.

41:56.966 --> 42:00.134
Daniel Hardman
is not the answer.

42:00.202 --> 42:02.904
You owe me.
