00:42.863 --> 00:44.403
Cold, cold, cold, cold !

00:45.012 --> 00:47.337
Icy feet, stupid frozen-tundra house!

00:48.608 --> 00:52.182
Honey, why are you sleeping in here? Your room is way warmer.

00:53.158 --> 00:56.640
Okay, here's the question for today, kids.

00:57.184 --> 00:58.795
What the hell are the Eskimos thinking?

00:58.954 --> 01:01.515
I mean, yes, the hoods are cute, but it's always cold. Always!

01:01.919 --> 01:04.925
Plus you have to eat fish for breakfast and you have to eat whales

01:05.037 --> 01:07.602
and then polar bears and penguins

01:07.879 --> 01:09.188
and Santa Claus...

01:10.484 --> 01:14.627
Okay, coffee's on, Pop-Tarts are pop-tarting!

01:15.835 --> 01:17.673
If you're just going to lie there, I'm going to have to sit here.

01:18.094 --> 01:20.787
I'm going to make myself very comfortable on a nice, warm Rory!

01:20.971 --> 01:22.235
Why is it so cold in here?

01:23.653 --> 01:24.596
I thought I was sitting on you!

01:24.835 --> 01:26.069
Oh, really? Good trick...

01:26.228 --> 01:28.098
Well, if you are there, then who is this?

01:28.344 --> 01:28.983
I don't know.

01:29.177 --> 01:30.299
We've got a stranger in our house.

01:30.446 --> 01:32.070
- Robert Downey, Jr? 
- Or a murderer.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.058
... who needed to take a nap before committing his crimes?

01:35.521 --> 01:36.909
I think this belongs to you.

01:37.088 --> 01:38.486
She must have followed me home from Yale.

01:38.726 --> 01:40.268
I told her she could hang out there this weekend.

01:40.390 --> 01:41.712
But why do that when you can come here

01:41.810 --> 01:43.150
and sleep where penguins need a coat?

01:43.314 --> 01:44.747
Yeah, why is it so cold in here?

01:44.892 --> 01:47.323
I broke that stupid window trying to lock it last night.

01:47.503 --> 01:48.558
Well, get it fixed, woman.

01:48.701 --> 01:50.472
I left Luke a message just now. He'll do it.

01:50.656 --> 01:52.489
Before or after the re-enactment of Alive?

01:52.644 --> 01:54.758
- Hopefully before. 
- Why don't you call a guy?

01:54.860 --> 01:56.673
- What guy? 
- A window fixing guy.

01:56.826 --> 01:59.437
Ah, Luke always gets mad when I pay someone

01:59.672 --> 02:01.464
to do something that he could do for free.

02:01.812 --> 02:05.719
And then he lectures me about it every time I see him and it's annoying.

02:06.708 --> 02:09.258
"Oh, you paid him how much to fix the window?

02:09.384 --> 02:12.335
What, you couldn't just find someone to steal your purse that day?

02:12.514 --> 02:14.598
Hey, while you're at it I've got an idea,

02:14.669 --> 02:17.133
why don't you go down to a Versateller and let them charge you five bucks

02:17.194 --> 02:19.077
to take your own money out of the bank?

02:19.123 --> 02:22.349
Or buy some tickets at Ticketmaster and wind up paying more in service charges

02:22.451 --> 02:24.260
than it would cost you to see the band?

02:24.423 --> 02:27.346
Oh, here's a great fifty buck mark up on a bottle of wine

02:27.439 --> 02:29.660
that it would have cost you ten dollars in the supermarket you're missing!"

02:29.778 --> 02:31.300
Oh my God, Luke is annoying.

02:34.478 --> 02:35.119
So…

02:36.112 --> 02:36.685
What?

02:38.738 --> 02:39.998
Just wondering what you're thinking about.

02:41.201 --> 02:42.410
I'm thinking about nothing.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.581
Nothing wouldn't happen to wear a leather jacket

02:44.662 --> 02:46.782
and be able to pull off an extremely convincing

02:47.104 --> 02:49.434
- "Adrian!" would it? 
- No, it wouldn't.

02:50.976 --> 02:52.245
You think he froze to death?

02:52.389 --> 02:54.667
- No, He wasn't sleeping here. 
- Right.

02:55.066 --> 02:56.225
I'm sure Luke took care of it.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.362
Hey, did somebody sit on me just now?

02:59.495 --> 03:01.047
- No, why? 
- My hip hurts.

03:01.246 --> 03:02.685
Oh, getting old...

03:06.055 --> 03:08.809
Hey, did anyone ever think that maybe Sylvia Plath wasn't crazy,

03:08.962 --> 03:10.079
she was just cold?

04:33.724 --> 04:35.618
Come on guys, push harder.

04:36.478 --> 04:38.578
We need more stars in the gazebo area.

04:38.690 --> 04:42.004
I repeat: we need more stars in the gazebo area.

04:42.220 --> 04:43.371
Do you copy? Roger.

04:43.843 --> 04:45.475
I'm supposed to say roger, Kirk.

04:46.438 --> 04:48.291
I don't think so. Copy. Roger.

04:48.712 --> 04:51.261
Roger means I heard you, Kirk. I was supposed to say roger.

04:51.506 --> 04:54.982
Negative. I am in charge here and I say roger! ROGER.

04:55.100 --> 04:55.966
No, you don't.

04:56.114 --> 04:57.492
Just let him say roger, Joe.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.391
If he says roger, what the hell am I supposed to say?

04:59.524 --> 05:00.257
Who cares?

05:00.917 --> 05:03.200
- Get out of the way, Kirk. 
- Hold on. Roger.

05:03.374 --> 05:04.456
This car is not stopping.

05:04.609 --> 05:07.578
I am planning the Firelight Festival. Taylor left me in charge,

05:07.640 --> 05:09.161
and I have to make sure everything is perfect.

05:09.237 --> 05:10.170
- Move! 
- Roger.

05:11.408 --> 05:13.211
Shouldn't you have a marching band behind you?

05:13.353 --> 05:14.060
Go away.

05:14.250 --> 05:17.976
The Budweiser Clydesdales prancing along, Ann Jillian waving in the back.

05:18.079 --> 05:21.080
I've got to get my car to Gypsy so she can fix it and I can leave.

05:21.214 --> 05:22.790
So you decided to push it there.

05:22.902 --> 05:23.795
I didn't have a choice.

05:23.943 --> 05:25.059
Just push this piece of junk out of my way!

05:25.171 --> 05:26.814
I'm going as fast as I can, jerk!

05:27.029 --> 05:29.568
Jess, do you at all find this ridiculous?

05:30.035 --> 05:33.220
Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do find this ridiculous.

05:33.456 --> 05:38.084
I find it ridiculous that Gypsy won't walk twenty feet to take a look at my car.

05:38.176 --> 05:39.358
Hire a tow truck.

05:39.527 --> 05:41.381
It costs eighty bucks to hire a tow truck.

05:41.663 --> 05:44.407
Oh, come on, it's like freakin' Carnivale out here.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.635
- I'll give you the eighty bucks. 
- No.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.774
- You're blocking the whole street. 
- I don't want your money.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.669
You wanna get out of here, let me pay the eighty bucks.

05:50.788 --> 05:51.734
I'll pitch in ten.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.463
Hey, how about more walkie, and less talkie.

05:54.595 --> 05:56.123
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

05:56.363 --> 05:58.605
Go home, you won't have to watch.

05:59.035 --> 05:59.613
Fine.

06:04.473 --> 06:05.891
- Well? 
- Still looking.

06:06.050 --> 06:07.628
- What's the matter with it? 
- Still looking.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.704
You've been circling around the thing for fifteen minutes.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.789
You waiting for it to tell you where it hurts?

06:11.902 --> 06:13.181
I've seen dumber things talk.

06:13.550 --> 06:15.158
Just tell me what's wrong with the car.

06:15.384 --> 06:16.510
You need a carburetor.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.956
- So how long until it's fixed? 
- Not sure.

06:19.408 --> 06:20.878
It has to be today.

06:21.088 --> 06:24.677
I have to walk out of this half-mile, four-block, freakhole of a medical experiment.

06:24.917 --> 06:25.895
You are delightful.

06:26.592 --> 06:29.986
I'll have you out of here tonight. Go away and come back at closing.

06:30.113 --> 06:30.656
Fine.

06:30.799 --> 06:32.561
And bring a lot of money because I'm going to overcharge you

06:32.659 --> 06:34.209
like you've never been overcharged before.

06:34.384 --> 06:35.668
I'll bet you say that to all the guys.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.712
On second thought, maybe I'm closing early tonight.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.551
I'm going.

06:41.449 --> 06:42.309
That's not her.

06:43.585 --> 06:44.158
What?

06:44.378 --> 06:45.484
She cut her hair.

06:45.684 --> 06:46.809
Don't know what you're talking about.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.571
Okay, my mistake.

06:54.348 --> 06:57.163
Okay, now. Hold it.

06:58.816 --> 07:01.188
Oh, okay, how does it look?

07:01.310 --> 07:02.236
Festive and femme.

07:02.401 --> 07:03.825
Yes, and completely ineffective.

07:03.993 --> 07:05.330
Maybe it just needs another layer.

07:05.452 --> 07:06.354
Yes, of glass.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.679
Nice. Something to protect us from freezer burn.

07:08.808 --> 07:09.773
Come over here and help us.

07:09.928 --> 07:11.546
I'm not going to help you Barbie Band-aid our window.

07:11.698 --> 07:16.076
I will, however, help you to call one of the many extremely qualified window repairmen

07:16.205 --> 07:17.587
that I've circled for you in the phone book.

07:17.711 --> 07:19.718
Hey, if we fix the window before Luke comes over,

07:19.886 --> 07:21.596
he will have his feelings hurt. Do you want that?

07:21.719 --> 07:23.495
- Phone book's on the kitchen table. 
- Where are you going?

07:23.608 --> 07:26.204
I'm going to take a walk, get a Danish, hit the bookstore,

07:26.306 --> 07:27.715
- and I'll be back for lunch. 
- Okay.

07:27.934 --> 07:29.951
Maybe if we add a layer of tinfoil.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.927
Hey, professional window guys are driving by,

07:32.998 --> 07:34.437
pointing and laughing. I just thought you should know.

07:34.518 --> 07:35.277
Thank you.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.383
So, listen, I have some errands to run today. Do you need anything?

07:39.608 --> 07:40.494
No, I'm fine.

07:41.093 --> 07:44.022
Okay. I'll probably be heading down Elm.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.551
Well, that's a good street.

07:46.940 --> 07:47.984
Yes, it is.

07:48.425 --> 07:50.780
If there is anything you'd want me to do on Elm,

07:50.878 --> 07:53.314
or anyone you wanted me to see, I could...

07:53.463 --> 07:54.251
That's okay.

07:56.679 --> 07:57.733
Has she said anything to you?

07:58.220 --> 07:59.642
No, but she's wanted to.

07:59.950 --> 08:00.831
How can you tell?

08:01.071 --> 08:02.361
Let's just say it's a mom thing.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.449
Yeah, well...

08:05.972 --> 08:07.421
Okay, well maybe tomorrow then.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.713
- Hello? 
- It's a complete disaster!

08:16.836 --> 08:19.263
- My existence? 
- Not everything is about you, Lorelai.

08:19.436 --> 08:20.113
Oh, sorry.

08:20.271 --> 08:22.309
The rare manuscripts acquisition fundraiser is tonight

08:22.422 --> 08:24.951
and we still haven't filled our table. I'm four people short.

08:25.098 --> 08:27.061
The Burles are going to visit their daughter in New Hampshire.

08:27.331 --> 08:29.697
Well then they can just go straight to hell, then, can't they?

08:29.831 --> 08:31.602
Mom, I already said I'd go.

08:31.730 --> 08:33.265
But we still have a half empty table.

08:33.404 --> 08:35.442
Well, fewer people to fight over the centerpiece.

08:35.652 --> 08:37.192
Stop it. This is not funny.

08:37.352 --> 08:39.908
The last person who didn't fill her table was Loretta Bobbins.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.273
Do you remember Loretta Bobbins?

08:41.474 --> 08:42.544
- No. 
- Exactly!

08:42.789 --> 08:45.361
Once you do not fill your table, you do not get another table to fill.

08:45.452 --> 08:47.674
- You are off the list. 
- Mom, that's not gonna happen to you.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.677
- You said you would come. 
- I am coming.

08:49.839 --> 08:50.894
And you're bringing someone.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.118
I never said I was bringing someone.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.638
- I'm telling you to now. 
- Mom, it's tonight.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.696
I need you to bring someone, Lorelai.

08:56.849 --> 08:59.256
- But I… 
- Loretta Bobbins, Lorelai.

08:59.404 --> 09:02.154
All right, the Dartmores are trying to change Bitty's viewing.

09:02.221 --> 09:03.342
They'll call back in a minute.

09:03.526 --> 09:05.554
They owe us, Richard. Remind them that they owe us.

09:06.644 --> 09:08.857
All right. I'll see you tonight at six o'clock sharp

09:08.953 --> 09:11.118
and don't wear those pantyhose with the seams up the back.

09:11.206 --> 09:12.420
You look like ten cents a dance.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.435
Richard, I need a gimlet.

09:16.909 --> 09:19.471
After we light the bonfire, the dancers should come through.

09:19.634 --> 09:20.478
Okay, Kirk.

09:20.663 --> 09:24.272
They'll circle the gazebo. Jazz hands, jazz hands, jazz hands.

09:24.502 --> 09:25.783
Then out come the flaming batons.

09:25.988 --> 09:26.980
That sounds good, Kirk.

09:27.370 --> 09:28.303
Are you ignoring me?

09:28.608 --> 09:30.651
Since you were old enough to walk, Kirk.

09:30.882 --> 09:32.035
- What do you think? 
- I think it's good.

09:32.152 --> 09:33.205
Is there too much turquoise?

09:33.335 --> 09:35.056
Are you kidding? Turquoise is timeless.

09:35.397 --> 09:36.791
What are you doing?

09:37.002 --> 09:40.047
Oh, hey, Luke. You remember my friend Carrie, right?

09:40.277 --> 09:41.799
Oh, yeah. Hey, Carrie.

09:41.951 --> 09:45.342
Hi, Butch, good to see you. Been under any bleachers lately?

09:45.465 --> 09:47.174
No, I haven't.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.806
- What is that? 
- It's an earring tree.

09:49.934 --> 09:52.253
- And what is it for? 
- You hang earrings on it.

09:52.356 --> 09:53.287
And what is it doing here?

09:53.410 --> 09:54.900
I thought I'd put some of my earrings out,

09:54.992 --> 09:57.598
you know, and see if I could sell some to the good people of Stars Hollow.

09:57.748 --> 09:58.557
- No. 
- Why?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.071
- They're cute. 
- This is a diner.

10:00.189 --> 10:02.688
- People come here to eat, not shop. 
- But now they can do both.

10:02.806 --> 10:05.167
Hey, Liz, can I talk to you for a moment?

10:05.278 --> 10:07.455
Liz, you want me to negotiate with him for you?

10:07.543 --> 10:09.795
No, she doesn't, Carrie. Thanks for the offer. Liz, please?

10:09.954 --> 10:11.284
Sure, my brother.

10:11.971 --> 10:14.418
Why are you so stressed about this?

10:14.567 --> 10:17.357
Liz, do you remember when you decided to make those ceramic pots?

10:17.474 --> 10:18.657
Without a kiln?

10:18.898 --> 10:20.321
- And how did that go? 
- Pretty bad.

10:20.393 --> 10:22.303
You were depressed for a month, you cut all your hair,

10:22.416 --> 10:25.082
- you threw out all your clothes... 
- I remember the bad times.

10:25.216 --> 10:28.432
You put those earring out on my counter and nobody buys them…

10:28.558 --> 10:30.470
They sell great at the fairs.

10:30.607 --> 10:33.419
I'm sure they do, but this is not a renaissance fair.

10:33.511 --> 10:35.773
Look around. Everybody here has a life.

10:35.871 --> 10:38.242
No one's gonna buy them. Please, just...

10:38.446 --> 10:41.749
Oh, look at this. Oh, these are so cute!

10:41.862 --> 10:44.002
- Luke, are you selling these? 
- He sure is.

10:44.191 --> 10:46.572
- I'll take 'em. 
- Excuse me, I wanted those.

10:46.762 --> 10:49.142
Turquoise? With your complexion?

10:49.255 --> 10:51.052
They're for Lulu. She's a sweetheart.

10:51.211 --> 10:52.594
Does she have pierced ears?

10:52.752 --> 10:54.052
I can check.

10:54.381 --> 10:57.283
Joe, have you ever noticed my girlfriend's lobes?

10:57.677 --> 10:58.333
What?

10:58.722 --> 11:01.010
Okay, thank you both for the show of support.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.362
It's very kind but you don't have to do this.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.235
Do what?

11:04.354 --> 11:06.249
Pretend that you like them because Liz made them.

11:06.377 --> 11:08.767
- Who's pretending? 
- Yeah, they're phat.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.846
- They're gonna fall apart. 
- No they're not.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.680
They're gonna make people's ears green and send them to the hospital.

11:12.782 --> 11:14.517
You cannot design my ad campaign.

11:14.604 --> 11:16.499
- Liz! 
- You need to nap, Jack.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.859
I'm cool, they're cool, everybody's cool.

11:19.094 --> 11:21.169
- Stop, Kirk! 
- Ouch! She slapped me!

11:21.640 --> 11:25.700
- Who saw her slap me? 
- Okay, relax you two.

11:25.823 --> 11:27.200
I can make you whatever you want!

11:27.344 --> 11:29.745
I want these ones in fuchsia pink. I want these in purple...

11:30.909 --> 11:33.753
Hi, I'd like a large coffee and a cherry Danish, please.

11:40.753 --> 11:41.449
I'm leaving.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.592
- A little farther back. Roger. 
- What?

11:51.822 --> 11:54.146
It's gotta go back farther. Roger.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.395
I can't hear you.

11:55.713 --> 11:58.273
Speak into to your walkie-talkie. Roger.

11:58.448 --> 11:59.840
Kirk, what are you saying?

12:00.644 --> 12:02.317
Speak into your...

12:02.487 --> 12:05.140
Speak into your walkie-talkie! Roger!

12:05.595 --> 12:08.067
I lost my walkie-talkie. I told you that.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.341
Then it's your own fault! Roger!

12:11.494 --> 12:14.575
Hey, Luke, hey Luke, hold on!

12:15.339 --> 12:17.857
Please, I know you owe us nothing but our dead frozen carcasses

12:17.966 --> 12:19.967
may someday haunt you in your old age, or not...

12:20.044 --> 12:21.098
because you don't know who I am.

12:21.211 --> 12:22.547
Hi. Sorry. I thought you were Luke.

12:22.873 --> 12:25.722
- I should put on some lipstick. 
- No, I just saw the truck.

12:26.096 --> 12:27.523
I borrowed the truck.

12:27.837 --> 12:28.717
- Right. 
- He knows.

12:29.091 --> 12:30.898
- I'm sure he does. 
- I'm Liz, Luke's sister.

12:31.062 --> 12:34.472
Oh, Luke's sister, yeah, I knew you were here.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.770
Hi, I'm Lorelai. So, is Luke in the diner?

12:36.899 --> 12:39.245
No, he just stepped out for a sec. You need him for something?

12:39.351 --> 12:40.637
I just needed to tell him something, I...

12:41.082 --> 12:42.064
You want me to give him a message?

12:42.612 --> 12:43.884
Sure, yeah...

12:44.323 --> 12:46.627
tell him Lorelai wanted to gently remind him about the window.

12:46.776 --> 12:48.813
I'll be home until five-thirty and tell him I looked cold.

12:49.033 --> 12:52.168
- Oh, you're the wife. 
- The wife?

12:52.319 --> 12:54.764
Yeah, I knew he got married, but I hadn't seen the face yet.

12:54.886 --> 12:57.435
So, oh wow, it's good to meet you.

12:57.691 --> 12:59.714
No, no, no. I'm not the wife.

12:59.847 --> 13:03.733
I'm the friend and the customer, not the wife.

13:03.918 --> 13:06.616
Oh, sorry. You look like his type, so…

13:06.744 --> 13:08.876
No, no, not his type or his wife,

13:09.129 --> 13:11.004
just his friend. And his customer.

13:11.173 --> 13:12.202
Still good to meet you.

13:12.365 --> 13:14.092
You too. Luke has told me a lot about you.

13:14.389 --> 13:16.979
- Yeah, like what? 
- Oh, like you're his sister…

13:17.112 --> 13:17.942
He admits it!

13:18.146 --> 13:20.434
And that, you know, you're here visiting him,

13:20.568 --> 13:23.056
and how happy he is that you're visiting him.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.044
- He did not say that. 
- I think he did.

13:25.274 --> 13:28.397
He's not probably too thrilled I'm here. I'm kind of pain in his ass.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.198
- Aren't we all? 
- Yeah, but I'm special.

13:31.807 --> 13:35.545
I kinda screw up a lot and then he has to fix it and then we fight

13:35.627 --> 13:38.176
and then I screw up again and he fixes it - it's a pattern.

13:38.468 --> 13:40.065
Luke likes his routine.

13:40.223 --> 13:42.667
He's pretty amazing though. No matter how much I screw up,

13:42.778 --> 13:46.112
he just keeps fixing it. I need money, he gives me money.

13:46.215 --> 13:47.920
No place to live, Luke finds an apartment.

13:48.089 --> 13:50.285
Even my kid when I was having trouble with him...

13:50.470 --> 13:52.517
- Did you ever meet Jess? 
- Oh yes, I did.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.991
I tell you, he was hell on wheels.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.056
I couldn't do a thing with him. I didn't know what to do, so...

13:58.457 --> 14:00.751
- Luke fixed it? 
- He tried.

14:00.894 --> 14:02.528
He wasn't entirely successful.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.607
I don't know, maybe if I had sent Jess to him a little sooner…

14:07.756 --> 14:11.082
Anyhow, Luke did what he could. He always does.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.915
He's like my hero, you know.

14:13.454 --> 14:16.459
Like one of those Greek gods with the golden helmets

14:16.573 --> 14:18.327
and the shields and the sandals.

14:18.435 --> 14:20.774
- And the little white toga dresses. 
- I sound silly.

14:21.241 --> 14:21.972
No, you don't.

14:22.409 --> 14:24.671
Take it from someone who's run to Luke many a time.

14:25.522 --> 14:27.417
He's definitely one of the good ones.

14:28.175 --> 14:29.275
Maybe THE good one.

14:30.186 --> 14:33.632
Yeah, I miss him. I've even been thinking of moving back here.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.388
- To Stars Hollow? 
- Maybe.

14:35.496 --> 14:39.949
I've discussed it with my boyfriend. I'm not sure how Luke would like it, but I sure would.

14:40.815 --> 14:41.905
I should get going.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.129
Sure.

14:43.390 --> 14:46.283
It was nice to meet you, friend and customer, not wife.

14:46.627 --> 14:47.732
Nice to meet you too.

14:48.317 --> 14:49.837
I'll be sure and give him your message.

14:50.018 --> 14:51.296
Don't forget, human popsicle.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.206
I have to tell you this is a real treat having you two girls over,

14:59.294 --> 15:02.617
like spur of the moment, I don't know what I did to get so damned lucky.

15:02.796 --> 15:05.294
We just realized we hadn't seen you very much lately

15:05.366 --> 15:07.839
and we thought "Hey, today is the perfect day to catch up with Babette."

15:07.935 --> 15:09.283
Oh, yeah, the perfect day.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.163
Well I am tickled pink.

15:11.484 --> 15:13.968
Here you go-- hot cocoa.

15:14.076 --> 15:14.899
Thanks, Babette.

15:15.084 --> 15:16.701
Ah, we don't deserve such treatment.

15:16.819 --> 15:18.022
Of course you do...

15:18.191 --> 15:22.318
two young hotsy-totsies like yourselves hanging out with an old bird like me.

15:22.405 --> 15:23.993
You deserve a lot better.

15:24.642 --> 15:27.834
So, you kids going to the Firelight Festival tonight?

15:27.998 --> 15:28.591
You bet.

15:28.714 --> 15:30.470
We're going to be late though because we have to make a pit stop

15:30.556 --> 15:31.826
at one of my mother's charity events.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.136
- Oh, sounds ritzy. 
- Like the cracker.

15:34.289 --> 15:36.343
The festival should be quite a shindig.

15:36.506 --> 15:40.495
Just watching Kirk trying to get those stars hung was worth the price of admission.

15:40.627 --> 15:43.689
You know, he insisted on demonstrating the correct way to hang 'em

15:43.756 --> 15:45.680
and treed himself. It took the fire department

15:45.773 --> 15:47.915
and two cans of tuna to get him down.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.209
I hate that I missed that.

15:49.377 --> 15:52.264
Plus, the whole town is buzzing about Jess coming back.

15:52.475 --> 15:56.618
Stupid little pisher, trying to sneak out of town without anyone knowing.

15:56.812 --> 15:58.824
This town, what is he kidding?

16:00.027 --> 16:02.245
Oh, I'm so sorry, sugar.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.370
Here I am, going on and on about Jess.

16:04.585 --> 16:05.849
It's fine, Babette. I'm fine.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.370
- She's fine. 
- You sure?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.524
- Yes. I'm sure. 
- She's fine.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.846
- I saw him. 
- Who?

16:10.942 --> 16:11.655
- Jess? 
- Yes.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.597
- When? 
- Where?

16:12.736 --> 16:14.246
- Today at Weston's. 
- He went into Weston's?

16:14.420 --> 16:16.083
- That little bastard. 
- What happened?

16:16.207 --> 16:18.024
I went in, he saw me and he left.

16:18.182 --> 16:19.284
- No! 
- He said nothing?

16:19.482 --> 16:22.418
No, he said something. He said, "I'm leaving."

16:22.785 --> 16:24.240
Way to state the obvious.

16:24.521 --> 16:27.041
It was so weird. I mean, he's the one who left town.

16:27.184 --> 16:30.962
He's the one who didn't call and now he just gets up and walks out like he's mad.

16:31.055 --> 16:32.033
What does he have to be mad about?

16:32.145 --> 16:34.869
Exactly! I should be mad. It's my town.

16:34.947 --> 16:36.836
I should be the one to walk out in a huff.

16:36.983 --> 16:38.470
You still stuck on him, honey?

16:38.577 --> 16:39.487
No, I'm not.

16:39.964 --> 16:42.585
I just wasn't expecting him to come back, that's all.

16:42.745 --> 16:43.614
He'll be gone soon.

16:43.978 --> 16:45.535
Yeah, I know. He'll be gone soon.

16:45.668 --> 16:47.885
Oh my God, I forgot the marshmallows!

16:49.220 --> 16:50.472
He'll be gone soon.

16:51.131 --> 16:52.472
Mayday! Mayday!

16:52.569 --> 16:54.546
The Morrison kids have stolen the bonfire again!

16:54.617 --> 16:57.838
I repeat: the kids have stolen the bonfire again! 

16:58.017 --> 16:59.338
Cesar, I'm back.

17:00.670 --> 17:01.581
What did you burn?

17:02.964 --> 17:04.034
- Liz! 
- Luke, hi!

17:04.140 --> 17:05.712
- What are you doing? 
- I just needed some things.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.531
- Steaks? 
- Yeah.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.273
You needed steaks?

17:07.351 --> 17:09.133
I'm making dinner upstairs and you don't have anything.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.034
Then go to a store.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.594
Oh, come on, a couple of steaks. What's the big deal?

17:12.721 --> 17:13.929
The big deal is, I run a diner.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.868
I sell food, that's how I make my living. It's how I can afford all this.

17:16.981 --> 17:19.086
Oh, you can spare a couple of things.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.154
How do you know what I can spare? That's a whole pie.

17:21.231 --> 17:22.839
It's a peach pie. Nobody eats the peach.

17:22.925 --> 17:24.103
A lot of people eat the peach.

17:24.202 --> 17:27.468
I'll buy a pie tomorrow. Tonight I'm making a feast for my guys.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.520
Your guys? Who are your guys?

17:29.628 --> 17:31.794
- You and T.J. 
- T. J.?

17:32.009 --> 17:35.306
Yep, you're really gonna like him. He's upstairs right now waiting for us and he...

17:35.368 --> 17:38.492
Upstairs in my apartment? You left some guy named T.J. alone in my apartment?

17:38.567 --> 17:40.872
- Ah, Liz! 
- I've been gone twenty seconds.

17:40.974 --> 17:42.889
- That's all it takes. 
- To do what?

17:42.991 --> 17:44.835
Steal the singing "Be Happy" Bass?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.519
Hey, that is my singing "Be Happy" Bass

17:46.622 --> 17:48.845
and it had better still be up there, including the batteries.

17:52.925 --> 17:54.194
Hey, I thought I'd make chili.

17:56.063 --> 17:57.403
You are not Liz.

17:57.789 --> 17:59.259
Already smarter than the last guy.

17:59.801 --> 18:03.154
Hi, baby. Look what I found downstairs.

18:03.984 --> 18:04.900
You must be Luke.

18:05.014 --> 18:06.559
I think she's talking about the steaks.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.673
I was not talking about the steaks.

18:08.925 --> 18:12.892
This is my "Him." This is my guy.

18:13.077 --> 18:14.321
This is T.J.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.054
- Guess what it stands for? 
- What?

18:17.392 --> 18:19.190
- T.J. Guess what it stands for? 
- I don't know.

18:19.308 --> 18:19.973
Just guess.

18:20.102 --> 18:21.853
- I can't. 
- Come on.

18:22.073 --> 18:25.088
- Thomas Jefferson? 
- No. Thomas Jefferson?

18:25.207 --> 18:27.091
Wow, that's a weird guess.

18:27.198 --> 18:28.580
Okay, you know, I've gotta go back.

18:28.687 --> 18:31.488
Oh no, come on, Cesar's there, sit down.

18:31.633 --> 18:32.323
You want a beer?

18:32.476 --> 18:34.786
You mean one of my beers out of my fridge? Sure, why not.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.835
Coming right up.

18:36.568 --> 18:38.534
Oh, I'm so excited.

18:38.673 --> 18:40.766
My two favorite guys are here with me,

18:40.945 --> 18:42.126
drinking, talking…

18:42.312 --> 18:44.775
And soon, there will be chili.

18:47.054 --> 18:48.237
I forgot something.

18:48.472 --> 18:51.252
Oh my God, this is freaky.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.966
It's like fate. Jess didn't know we were here.

18:54.248 --> 18:58.057
I had no idea that Jess would come by and now look at us together.

18:58.338 --> 19:02.245
All the men in my life are drawn here to me.

19:03.325 --> 19:05.905
This is positive. This means something. Do you feel it?

19:06.080 --> 19:06.811
I sure do.

19:07.026 --> 19:08.906
Baby, this is my kid.

19:09.198 --> 19:09.889
This is Jess.

19:10.739 --> 19:12.583
Jess, this is T.J.

19:12.771 --> 19:14.266
- Guess what it stands for. 
- No.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.361
Oh, you'll stay for dinner.

19:16.811 --> 19:18.198
I've gotta go check on my car.

19:18.373 --> 19:20.769
Come on, we're making a ton of food. There's beer.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.208
- My beer. 
- I'm not hungry.

19:22.350 --> 19:24.491
Oh please, stay for a little while.

19:24.615 --> 19:26.503
I think you guys are really gonna get along great.

19:35.046 --> 19:38.250
T.J. is really enjoying Stars Hollow. Aren't you, baby?

19:38.346 --> 19:39.764
Oh yeah, this place is great.

19:40.056 --> 19:42.320
- It reminds me of New York. 
- How?

19:42.458 --> 19:45.227
- You know. 
- Neither one is in space.

19:45.422 --> 19:47.358
- No, that's not it. 
- Of course not.

19:47.516 --> 19:48.668
There's an energy, right?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.765
There is. I feel it. A very similar energy.

19:53.389 --> 19:55.682
Liz showed me your old house and your school.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.178
Like the picture of you in the shorts.

19:57.439 --> 20:01.017
My brother was very big in athletics in his day.

20:01.351 --> 20:03.532
And the ladies loved him.

20:04.141 --> 20:05.610
Ask Carrie. They went out.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.509
Crazy Carrie and I did not go out.

20:08.826 --> 20:10.761
- They just made out. 
- We did not make out.

20:10.869 --> 20:14.264
We did not go out. We did nothing that involved the word out.

20:14.586 --> 20:15.932
I think he's still hung up on her.

20:16.030 --> 20:18.201
- A lightening bolt, please. 
- I gotta go.

20:18.430 --> 20:22.099
Oh, okay, but come back after you've checked your car.

20:22.209 --> 20:24.376
We'll save you some food. You look good.

20:25.205 --> 20:25.824
Handsome.

20:26.070 --> 20:27.529
If I was some girl, I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

20:28.319 --> 20:29.761
- Come back, okay? 
- Okay.

20:30.197 --> 20:32.690
Yeah, if you do, I'll draw your portrait on my Etch-A-Sketch.

20:32.828 --> 20:33.863
Hey, can't miss that.

20:35.138 --> 20:35.798
We'll see.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.662
Hey, Jess wait a sec.

20:43.110 --> 20:45.327
- So, wow. 
- Yep.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.447
If I had to pick anyone in the world for my sister to be with,

20:47.534 --> 20:49.372
that guy would definitely be his cab driver.

20:49.478 --> 20:50.826
I don't know. He had a certain something.

20:50.913 --> 20:53.058
- Yeah, lack of chromosomes. 
- That sounds right.

20:53.129 --> 20:53.898
So, what do we do?

20:54.465 --> 20:56.104
- About what? 
- About that, them, him.

20:56.279 --> 20:56.842
Nothing.

20:57.364 --> 20:59.227
- Where are you going? 
- To check on my car.

20:59.382 --> 21:01.224
But Jess, don't you think that we should discuss this?

21:01.379 --> 21:03.422
- Discuss what? 
- T.J.

21:03.616 --> 21:05.675
- I thought we just did. 
- But we didn't come up with a solution.

21:05.761 --> 21:08.085
- A solution to what? 
- Are we having the same conversation?

21:08.177 --> 21:09.495
A solution to him.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.437
A solution would have been birth control. Too late, move on.

21:12.551 --> 21:14.993
Jess, we have to do something about this.

21:15.811 --> 21:17.004
- Like what? 
- I don't know.

21:17.107 --> 21:18.357
- We have to say something. 
- Like what?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.067
He's a grown man with an Etch-A-Sketch!

21:20.163 --> 21:22.268
So shake him real hard. Maybe he'll disappear.

21:22.370 --> 21:23.845
Oh come on. What, do you like this guy?

21:23.958 --> 21:26.128
Of course I don't like this guy. I don't like any of the guys,

21:26.334 --> 21:28.260
but she's gonna do what she's gonna do.

21:28.377 --> 21:32.078
No, I do not accept that. We can go to Liz together. We can tell her...

21:32.165 --> 21:33.758
She does not care what we think.

21:34.106 --> 21:35.744
She really doesn't care what I think.

21:36.005 --> 21:38.069
I've got nineteen years of proof to back me up.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.548
Yes, she does. You just have to find the right angle with Liz.

21:40.793 --> 21:42.779
- Can I go please? 
- No, you can't go.

21:42.877 --> 21:47.731
We have to fix this. I cannot watch her throw her life away again with a loser again.

21:47.844 --> 21:49.005
You see, this is your problem.

21:49.230 --> 21:51.418
You're going to help people whether they want it or not.

21:51.566 --> 21:53.367
You have to fix everything.

21:53.670 --> 21:55.114
You have to fix everyone.

21:55.298 --> 21:59.035
You think it makes you a good guy, but really, it just makes you a pain in the ass.

21:59.932 --> 22:02.696
You make it so that when people fail you,

22:02.890 --> 22:07.260
you get to feel like the martyr and they get to feel like not only did they screw up,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.214
but they also disappointed you.

22:09.679 --> 22:12.676
You interfere and you make everything worse.

22:12.849 --> 22:13.787
No one is asking for your help.

22:14.109 --> 22:15.660
No one wants your help.

22:15.829 --> 22:18.026
Focus on your own life and leave everyone else alone.

22:27.411 --> 22:29.398
Give it back! I mean it!

22:29.541 --> 22:31.277
I'm in charge here guys! Come on!

22:33.074 --> 22:34.093
Give it back! I need that!

22:35.705 --> 22:36.714
Hey, Andrew.

22:38.409 --> 22:39.996
Can you track these down for me? They're all out of print.

22:40.103 --> 22:41.164
- You got it. 
- Thanks.

22:56.463 --> 22:57.010
Ow! Damn it.

22:57.343 --> 22:57.884
Hello?

22:59.926 --> 23:00.656
Oh, Luke.

23:00.988 --> 23:01.971
Oh yeah. Hey.

23:02.504 --> 23:03.429
How did you get in here?

23:03.681 --> 23:04.987
You left your bedroom window open.

23:05.315 --> 23:06.803
My bedroom window is on the second floor.

23:07.358 --> 23:07.986
What did you do?

23:08.173 --> 23:12.007
I promised to fix your window, so I'm here to fix your window.

23:12.170 --> 23:13.594
Oh, my God, you cut yourself.

23:13.721 --> 23:15.764
- Glass was broken. 
- Hence the need for fixing.

23:15.943 --> 23:19.051
I'm sorry. Are you drunk?

23:19.563 --> 23:22.149
I am not drunk. I do not get drunk.

23:22.308 --> 23:25.768
I had some beer-beers. More than one.

23:26.046 --> 23:29.083
A few. And then I came here and I climbed your tree.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.632
- Well, good thinking. 
- And then I fell out of your tree.

23:31.806 --> 23:32.677
Sit down.

23:32.942 --> 23:35.492
I landed flat on my back. I felt like Kirk.

23:35.819 --> 23:36.848
Hold your hand up in the air.

23:38.089 --> 23:40.966
And then I climbed back up the tree. This time I made it.

23:41.161 --> 23:43.761
I got in. Sorry about the lamp.

23:44.213 --> 23:46.070
You know, Luke, you could have broken your neck.

23:46.311 --> 23:48.224
You know, it would have been all right if I had.

23:48.349 --> 23:50.495
I would have fixed it because that's what I do:

23:50.725 --> 23:53.454
I fix things. Even when they don't want to be fixed.

23:54.236 --> 23:55.593
- Let me see your hand. 
- Why?

23:55.731 --> 23:59.065
Because it is bleeding and I need to look at it. Ew! Gross!

23:59.654 --> 24:02.305
- It's fine, leave it. 
- I can't leave it, it's cut.

24:02.491 --> 24:03.371
That's my wrist.

24:03.715 --> 24:05.061
Ah, sorry.

24:06.305 --> 24:07.555
You're very good at this.

24:07.985 --> 24:10.012
- I don't like blood okay? 
- So leave it alone.

24:10.134 --> 24:11.301
No, I can't leave it.

24:12.849 --> 24:14.358
Do you want to tell me what happened?

24:15.578 --> 24:16.186
Nothing.

24:17.492 --> 24:18.152
What are you doing?

24:18.507 --> 24:20.533
- I'm going to fix the window. 
- Forget the window.

24:20.692 --> 24:21.962
I can't forget the window.

24:22.135 --> 24:24.322
I made a promise and I'm the reliable guy

24:24.516 --> 24:27.046
who helps everybody out whether they like it or not.

24:27.195 --> 24:28.260
- What? 
- Oh, yeah.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.616
Nothing I can do about it, just the way I am.

24:31.029 --> 24:32.653
It is my big problem.

24:32.934 --> 24:35.080
Didn't know it was my big problem until today,

24:35.213 --> 24:38.874
but now I know. It is my big problem.

24:39.150 --> 24:41.592
- Got a handful of Barbie. 
- Luke, what happened today?

24:41.828 --> 24:45.479
Today I found out what a big, dumb, idiot guy I am.

24:45.607 --> 24:50.559
Just an imposing, judgmental know-it-all who blows around yelling

24:50.686 --> 24:53.804
and complaining and screwing up everybody else's life.

24:54.024 --> 24:55.734
- I hardly think you're... 
- I'm dumb.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.596
Yeah, not like Jess. Jess is smart.

24:58.756 --> 25:00.926
You know, he doesn't care about anybody else's life.

25:01.043 --> 25:04.126
He just takes care of himself.

25:04.623 --> 25:05.908
Did you and Jess have a thing?

25:06.118 --> 25:08.110
He informed me that I am nothing

25:08.387 --> 25:12.011
but an unwelcome burden to everyone around me.

25:12.943 --> 25:15.427
- Luke, that's not true. 
- Yes, it is.

25:16.025 --> 25:16.860
Luke, stop it.

25:18.340 --> 25:21.437
Liz was just saying today how grateful she is to have you as her brother

25:21.554 --> 25:23.654
- and how much she looks up to you. 
- You talked to Liz?

25:23.834 --> 25:25.810
- I thought she was you. 
- I'm a man.

25:25.994 --> 25:27.413
She was in your truck.

25:27.699 --> 25:30.055
When I'm in my truck, I'm still a man.

25:30.383 --> 25:32.276
I couldn't see who was driving, okay?

25:32.399 --> 25:34.473
I went over the truck and we met and we started talking.

25:34.594 --> 25:35.861
You shouldn't have talked to Liz.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.499
She worships you.

25:38.405 --> 25:41.882
She said she even wants to move to Stars Hollow so she can be closer to you.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.308
- She didn't say that. 
- She did say that.

25:44.565 --> 25:47.827
Jess is an unhappy kid, Luke. He's angry.

25:48.026 --> 25:50.535
- He doesn't mean the things he says. 
- He did me a favor.

25:50.827 --> 25:55.573
Listen, why don't you hang out here and rest for little while, okay?

25:55.700 --> 25:58.051
- We'll get you a real bandage. 
- I like the Barbie ones.

25:58.313 --> 26:01.702
Yes, honey, but the other kids will beat you up if they see you with one of those.

26:04.334 --> 26:05.070
I'll be right back.

26:17.625 --> 26:18.531
You sure I can't help you?

26:20.097 --> 26:21.292
Can I hand you something?

26:22.182 --> 26:24.961
You know, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to run.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.992
Just curious--have you noticed since you started standing there,

26:29.232 --> 26:31.465
there's been a lot less of the clinking sounds?

26:31.735 --> 26:34.479
And the clinking sounds are the sounds tools make when they fix things.

26:34.624 --> 26:35.970
You've been fixing this car for hours.

26:36.113 --> 26:37.726
And I'm not done, so, back off.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.659
- Jess! 
- Hey, she sounds mad.

26:41.111 --> 26:43.702
You've been here less than twenty-four hours and already I wanna kill you.

26:43.813 --> 26:45.585
- What did I do to you? 
- All the crap you said to Luke...

26:45.677 --> 26:46.747
- What crap? 
- A man who has done nothing

26:46.808 --> 26:49.584
- but support you and try to help you. 
- I don't know what you're talking about.

26:49.722 --> 26:52.200
You do know what I'm talking about. Don't act stupid.

26:52.328 --> 26:55.257
Why would you do that? What an incredibly insensitive, mean-spirited--

26:55.344 --> 26:57.719
Oh, drop it. This has nothing to do with Luke. This is about Rory.

26:57.847 --> 26:59.645
This is not about Rory. This is about Luke.

26:59.825 --> 27:02.282
Don't you have an ounce of sensitivity in that thick head of yours

27:02.380 --> 27:05.681
or are you so mad at the entire world that you don't care who you hurt?

27:05.835 --> 27:07.663
And I suppose we're still not talking about Rory?

27:07.852 --> 27:09.439
Wow, second "Rory" in ten seconds.

27:09.639 --> 27:11.779
You sure have Rory on the brain. I wonder why that is.

27:11.933 --> 27:13.874
- You started this! 
- Is that why you came back here?

27:14.078 --> 27:16.465
Are you still hung up on her Jess ? Is that why you came back?

27:16.670 --> 27:17.621
- No. 
- Good.

27:17.908 --> 27:21.850
Because she is over you. She has moved on and she is very happy.

27:22.050 --> 27:23.985
Please hurry up so I can get the hell out of here.

27:24.154 --> 27:25.046
I second that.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.814
I wonder where Demi and Ashton are sitting.

27:34.933 --> 27:36.207
- I think we're late. 
- We're not late.

27:36.325 --> 27:37.518
Grandma said dinner starts at six.

27:37.635 --> 27:39.555
- Yeah, well that means seven. 
- In what universe?

27:39.677 --> 27:41.589
They invite you at six knowing you won't be here until seven

27:41.675 --> 27:43.657
so dinner won't start until eight. Actually we're early.

27:43.815 --> 27:45.638
Oh, there they are. Hey. Hi Mom.

27:46.384 --> 27:48.379
- Oh, that's a bad face. 
- Told you we were late.

27:48.711 --> 27:50.989
- What is Rory doing here? 
- Hi, Grandma.

27:51.122 --> 27:52.304
You weren't supposed to bring Rory.

27:52.426 --> 27:54.107
You're really helping the kid's self-esteem here, Mom.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.872
You don't know one man that would be willing to spend the evening with you?

27:56.990 --> 27:57.989
I thought you liked Rory.

27:58.116 --> 28:00.091
We do like Rory but we're short of men.

28:00.205 --> 28:01.086
Well so am I.

28:01.244 --> 28:04.040
Honestly, Lorelai. It's not your looks that keep them away. Think about that.

28:04.137 --> 28:05.458
Excuse me, should I stay, or--?

28:05.550 --> 28:07.685
Of course you should stay. We can't do anything about that now.

28:07.787 --> 28:08.669
Come on, come on...

28:08.879 --> 28:11.136
So on a wigged-out level of one to ten, Mom is at--

28:11.218 --> 28:12.174
- Frances Farmer? 
- Yeah.

28:12.717 --> 28:14.439
Rory, what are you doing here?

28:14.690 --> 28:16.219
Lorelai couldn't find a man.

28:16.369 --> 28:18.160
You weren't specific, Mom. You didn't say, "Bring a man."

28:18.428 --> 28:20.521
And if I had, you would have been able to find one?

28:20.624 --> 28:21.590
Rory, sit over there.

28:22.441 --> 28:25.553
Marjorie, Shawna, this is my daughter Lorelai and her daughter Rory.

28:25.810 --> 28:26.958
This is Marjorie and Shawna.

28:28.217 --> 28:29.707
Who are Marjorie and Shawna?

28:30.084 --> 28:31.980
Richard and Jason's secretaries.

28:32.112 --> 28:35.794
Dull girls, like two rolling pins sitting across from you, but we were desperate.

28:35.917 --> 28:37.627
- Hello, Emily, Richard. 
- Ah, Jason.

28:37.862 --> 28:38.657
You're late, Jason.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.140
I know, I'm sorry but I got hung up talking to Feriman in the lobby.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.178
Feriman is here?

28:42.323 --> 28:44.120
Yes, and he's three drinks ahead of everybody else.

28:44.283 --> 28:46.177
- Oh, marvelous. 
- No, don't sit there!

28:46.362 --> 28:48.846
- Sit next to Lorelai. Rory move over. 
- Why?

28:49.004 --> 28:50.576
- You two, pretend you're together. 
- What?

28:50.718 --> 28:51.615
Emily, good idea.

28:51.918 --> 28:54.702
Shawna, Marjorie, for God's sake, look like you belong here.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.002
Oh yes, that's much better.

28:57.181 --> 28:59.194
- So who else is joining us? 
- No one.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.553
We brought one of Richard's coats to hang over the chair.

29:01.716 --> 29:03.181
We're saying it's Marjorie's husband.

29:03.432 --> 29:06.254
He's making the rounds and at about eight he'll get sick and have to leave.

29:06.361 --> 29:08.071
Does everybody understand the story?

29:08.225 --> 29:10.653
I think so. But then we'll have to hide his jacket.

29:10.805 --> 29:13.657
So I suggest I put it under my dress and pretend to be pregnant,

29:13.765 --> 29:16.939
then Jason can pretend to be the doctor, then Rory can dig a tunnel, and...

29:17.057 --> 29:19.269
I might have known you'd turn this into something ridiculous, Lorelai.

29:19.352 --> 29:20.381
Yeah, I wanna be the doctor.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.614
Oh good Lord.

29:22.008 --> 29:23.897
And Jason, move closer to Lorelai.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.714
And for God's sake, you two, at least act like you like each other.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.845
Hey, your mom said.

29:32.423 --> 29:33.375
Hey, there you are.

29:33.503 --> 29:36.867
Yes here I am, at my job. Will wonders never cease?

29:36.974 --> 29:39.110
- Major party happening outside. 
- So I hear.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.184
You gotta see it.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.437
I'm sure you can see enough for the both of us.

29:42.755 --> 29:44.925
Big fire, crazy punch, too.

29:45.028 --> 29:46.815
Seriously, man, come on out. You won't believe it.

29:46.898 --> 29:49.748
No, T.J., actually, I will believe it, because, see, I live here,

29:49.897 --> 29:54.167
so I've seen this festival, oh let's say, about five thousand times.

29:54.291 --> 29:55.679
Yes, I see your point.

29:55.832 --> 29:58.862
Okay, Liz and I are taking off right after the festivities,

29:58.944 --> 30:00.654
so maybe you can come out and say sayonara.

30:00.818 --> 30:02.503
- I'll come out as soon as I can. 
- Great.

30:03.184 --> 30:04.018
How long do you think?

30:04.479 --> 30:05.504
How long I think what?

30:05.641 --> 30:06.860
How long do you think you will be doing that?

30:06.998 --> 30:08.755
- I don't know. 
- Looks like you're almost done.

30:08.871 --> 30:11.017
- Well I'm not. 
- The stack is getting pretty small.

30:11.147 --> 30:13.485
Look, I will be out soon, okay?

30:13.629 --> 30:14.299
Okay.

30:15.252 --> 30:17.658
- I am going to hold you to that. 
- I consider myself warned.

30:23.158 --> 30:25.292
The importance cannot be overstated.

30:25.347 --> 30:28.400
Language is humanity's lifeline.

30:28.559 --> 30:31.876
That is why I thank each and every one of you

30:31.918 --> 30:38.400
for your loyal support of the Ephram Wordus Rare Manuscript Acquisition Foundation.

30:38.774 --> 30:44.329
Because without it, we would just be stuck rooting around Nag Hammadi.

30:48.006 --> 30:49.034
Psst! I don't get it.

30:49.501 --> 30:50.826
- Me neither. 
- You go to Yale.

30:51.036 --> 30:53.289
I skipped Obscure Manuscript Humor 101.

30:53.699 --> 30:54.573
Hey, why was that funny?

30:54.886 --> 30:56.750
- No... no idea. 
- You were laughing.

30:57.205 --> 30:59.617
Take a poll. No one in this room has any idea

30:59.719 --> 31:01.184
what this crazy old man is talking about.

31:01.451 --> 31:02.525
What a bunch of poseurs.

31:02.729 --> 31:05.040
...hundreds of literary artifacts

31:05.234 --> 31:07.860
which might otherwise have been lost.

31:07.973 --> 31:09.636
How far do you think we can push this?

31:09.756 --> 31:10.999
- I'm not sure. 
- Dancing?

31:11.132 --> 31:12.524
- Possibly. 
- Stroll on the terrace?

31:12.618 --> 31:13.114
Passable.

31:13.314 --> 31:14.557
Making out in the coat-check room?

31:14.670 --> 31:15.997
Oh, that's going to be tricky.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.344
So, once again, I thank you

31:19.513 --> 31:22.340
and I hope you all have a lovely evening.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.231
I'm going to go find Feriman.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.438
I have to say hello to Babe Wellington.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.638
Mom, how much longer do Jason and I have to pretend to be together?

31:35.044 --> 31:36.911
Lorelai, don't do this to me.

31:37.045 --> 31:40.430
Until this evening is over, you are together and I don't want to discuss it again.

31:40.612 --> 31:41.243
Fine.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.054
- I just secured us the coatroom. 
- Let's go.

31:45.019 --> 31:47.172
I'm going to make out in the coatroom. Don't eat my chicken.

31:47.291 --> 31:48.345
That's going on your tombstone.

31:48.893 --> 31:49.497
Jason.

31:50.004 --> 31:52.452
Oh, hello. I didn't know you'd be here.

31:52.610 --> 31:53.880
- You look well. 
- Thank you.

31:54.002 --> 31:55.211
- How is business? 
- Very good.

31:55.425 --> 31:57.018
- I'm pleased to hear. 
- How's your golf game?

31:57.249 --> 31:58.989
Well it certainly can't match yours but I'm catching up.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.155
- Well, when you're ready… 
- I'll give you a call.

32:01.304 --> 32:02.808
Fine. Good to see you again.

32:02.963 --> 32:03.679
Same to you.

32:06.229 --> 32:07.642
Well, who was that?

32:07.928 --> 32:09.592
- My father. 
- Your father?

32:09.700 --> 32:11.739
And you two have met before?

32:12.178 --> 32:14.887
Yes, briefly. I believe there was an Aquaman party involved.

32:15.071 --> 32:18.205
Oh, man. This business thing must have been really bad for you guys.

32:18.348 --> 32:18.972
What do you mean?

32:19.239 --> 32:22.110
I mean, that was so cold. You talked like you barely knew each other.

32:22.239 --> 32:23.935
Oh, no, no, we've always been like that.

32:24.174 --> 32:24.948
You're kidding.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.774
No, actually, asking me about my golf game

32:27.861 --> 32:29.952
was actually a little too touchy-feely for me.

32:30.119 --> 32:33.058
Wow, who would have thought I would ever put my mother

32:33.140 --> 32:34.839
next to someone and think, "warm?"

32:35.567 --> 32:37.493
Jason, I just heard your father was here.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.216
How could you possibly have found that out this quickly?

32:40.335 --> 32:42.152
News travels fast here. People talk.

32:42.372 --> 32:44.200
- So, what did Floyd say? 
- Well...

32:44.312 --> 32:46.350
Richard, Floyd was just here.

32:46.642 --> 32:47.680
We know, Mom, we saw him.

32:47.984 --> 32:50.001
He came by the table? What nerve.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.478
- How dare he talk to his son. 
- Be quiet, Lorelai.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.205
If he's here he must have a motive.

32:54.312 --> 32:57.066
That's right. He never cared about rare manuscripts before.

32:57.195 --> 32:58.930
He must be trying to get information.

32:59.079 --> 33:00.512
Richard, I don't think he had an agenda.

33:00.655 --> 33:02.171
What was his body language like?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.198
He was breathing and standing.

33:04.404 --> 33:05.842
I think all signs point to alive.

33:06.063 --> 33:08.074
What did he ask you about?

33:08.202 --> 33:09.354
He asked me about my golf game.

33:09.513 --> 33:10.650
- Not the business? 
- No.

33:10.802 --> 33:12.303
Oh, oh, oh. He's tricky.

33:12.426 --> 33:14.055
He didn't ask about the business, Dad, okay?

33:14.199 --> 33:16.861
I know he didn't ask about the business, Lorelai. That was deliberate.

33:16.984 --> 33:19.615
So he wanted to know nothing on purpose? The fiend.

33:19.794 --> 33:20.802
Please, stay out of it.

33:20.962 --> 33:23.672
He is planning something. Jason, I think we should strategize.

33:23.777 --> 33:24.951
Richard, I really don't think...

33:25.083 --> 33:26.849
I have been doing this a lot longer than you have, my boy.

33:27.055 --> 33:31.284
If a man like Floyd Stiles comes over to you and does not ask about the business,

33:31.508 --> 33:33.941
you can be sure that something very big is coming.

33:35.939 --> 33:38.764
I guess I have to go. If you'll excuse me, ladies.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.991
Bye. Nobody was believing you two as a couple anyway.

34:21.007 --> 34:23.504
This is Bird Dog One to Bird Dog Two.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.706
The southwest corner is secure.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.538
I'm at the southwest corner, Kirk.

34:28.324 --> 34:29.279
Then where the hell am I?

34:30.524 --> 34:33.273
Well, look who finally came out of his cave.

34:33.411 --> 34:35.213
Oh, Carrie. What a coincidence.

34:35.371 --> 34:36.933
You remember Anna, Jill.

34:37.041 --> 34:38.695
Hello, Anna. Hello, Jill.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.623
We just came from the reunion so we're a little tipsy.

34:41.777 --> 34:45.838
Ah, you know, drink water, and take some aspirin before you go to bed.

34:46.032 --> 34:48.545
I told them that you're trying to pretend

34:48.596 --> 34:51.121
that you don't remember the night.

34:51.217 --> 34:53.040
I don't remember the night.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.657
- I remember the night. 
- The whole reunion remembered the night

34:55.780 --> 34:57.536
- We all talked about it. 
- Terrific.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.866
Everybody had a crush on Butch Danes in high school.

35:00.009 --> 35:02.523
So serious, so intense.

35:02.650 --> 35:04.760
So hot in those tiny little shorts.

35:04.899 --> 35:07.003
Okay, I should go find Liz.

35:07.136 --> 35:08.545
Oh, I'll help you find her.

35:08.652 --> 35:10.505
Oh, no, I don't wanna break up the party.

35:10.618 --> 35:12.466
Oh, there's always room for a foursome.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.906
So twenty years later, none of you are married?

35:16.014 --> 35:17.141
Oh, no, we're all married.

35:17.315 --> 35:18.180
Oh, there's Liz.

35:19.942 --> 35:21.144
They're not gonna run out of punch are they?

35:21.237 --> 35:24.032
- They never run out of punch. 
- Oh, okay, I should go.

35:24.216 --> 35:30.417
Wait, we're all going to the Styx/REO Speedwagon/Journey concert next week.

35:30.530 --> 35:32.614
We have an extra ticket if you're interested.

35:32.865 --> 35:36.857
Oh, wow. If it was just Styx and REO Speedwagon,

35:36.951 --> 35:39.485
I'd be there, but Journey freaks me out.

35:39.587 --> 35:41.000
Sorry. Enjoy the festival.

35:42.526 --> 35:46.545
So there's a line a mile long, the place is going crazy for the earrings.

35:46.632 --> 35:47.896
Oh, come on T.J.

35:48.056 --> 35:49.586
Hey, I'm just telling it how it is.

35:49.781 --> 35:53.380
The last fair we went, the line was so long it blocked the fruit-ice stand.

35:53.549 --> 35:57.728
And traditionally the fruit-ice people are not the nicest people on the circuit

35:57.844 --> 36:00.052
but you block their stand and they really go crazy.

36:00.190 --> 36:02.515
They threw lemon rinds. But it didn't matter.

36:02.617 --> 36:04.439
Most people stayed and they bought plenty.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.309
People seem to like my stuff.

36:06.723 --> 36:09.192
We're heading to Minnesota next month. Big fair there.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.199
And this time we're unveiling the booth.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.356
The booth?

36:12.499 --> 36:15.673
T.J. just built me the greatest booth. You should see it.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.806
You've gotta have a good booth. It's the first thing people see.

36:18.929 --> 36:20.696
Earrings are small. You don't know they're there

36:20.762 --> 36:24.141
until you're right up on them, but a booth and a nice sign?

36:25.145 --> 36:27.286
A person's standing at the jousting match,

36:27.445 --> 36:29.856
they turn around and,"Hey, look at that booth with the nice sign."

36:29.918 --> 36:33.122
They come over, take a look at Lizzie's stuff, and bam, they're hooked.

36:33.475 --> 36:35.970
Well, Luke, nice of you to join us.

36:36.098 --> 36:37.423
Oh hi, Luke, I didn't see you there.

36:37.536 --> 36:39.932
Yeah, I heard you were leaving right after the festival, so...

36:40.244 --> 36:42.278
I'm so glad that you came out.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.222
See you later, Liz.

36:46.399 --> 36:49.532
Can you believe this thing? It hasn't changed one bit since we were kids.

36:49.635 --> 36:52.138
Yeah, same crazy gathering that Mom would take us to.

36:52.262 --> 36:55.109
- And then Dad after she died. 
- He hated it worse than we did.

36:55.220 --> 36:56.772
He only took us 'cause Mom liked it.

36:56.935 --> 37:00.310
- Of course, that Founder's Day punch… 
- Lethal.

37:00.396 --> 37:03.305
The first time I ever threw up on booze it was Founder's Day punch.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.319
That's a nice story.

37:04.933 --> 37:08.451
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about Jess.

37:08.783 --> 37:11.180
Boy, that statement could encompass a whole myriad of things.

37:11.379 --> 37:13.575
I'm sorry I told you I wasn't in touch with him.

37:13.879 --> 37:17.575
It's just been the last six months he started calling and he asked me not to tell you,

37:17.707 --> 37:19.893
so I was trying to bond or something.

37:20.723 --> 37:22.331
I just mentioned the car to him.

37:22.439 --> 37:24.036
I didn't know he'd come back here and try to take it.

37:24.411 --> 37:26.786
It's okay. It's his car and he should have it.

37:27.124 --> 37:28.762
I'm just trying to make things better with us.

37:29.075 --> 37:31.256
You should. It's fine.

37:32.172 --> 37:33.595
I have a feeling about him.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.311
I think he's going to be okay.

37:36.642 --> 37:38.168
He's kinda like Dad, don't you think?

37:38.516 --> 37:41.324
- Oh, I don't know. 
- Oh, I do. I think he's like Dad.

37:42.036 --> 37:44.988
I want to thank you for everything that you did for him.

37:45.515 --> 37:46.882
Well it never hurts to take a shot.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.700
At least you know you tried.

37:49.094 --> 37:51.591
Sometimes things take a while before they sink in.

37:52.074 --> 37:52.909
It did with me.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.627
Sorry, I'm so boring tonight.

37:55.837 --> 37:57.292
I only had one cup of punch.

37:57.551 --> 37:59.963
Gary switched us over to club soda after that.

38:00.169 --> 38:01.203
You're not boring.

38:02.382 --> 38:04.296
- Who's Gary? 
- That's T.J.'s real name.

38:04.423 --> 38:05.514
T.J.'s real name is Gary?

38:05.662 --> 38:06.470
Gary?

38:06.681 --> 38:08.350
How the heck did he get - Never mind.

38:08.781 --> 38:12.436
I heard him talking back there, Gary.

38:13.342 --> 38:14.940
It sounds like things are going pretty good.

38:15.047 --> 38:16.926
- They are. Really good. 
- Good, good.

38:18.816 --> 38:21.325
Oh, hey, wait. I just made these last night.

38:23.152 --> 38:24.407
You can give them to your wife.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.818
Or Lorelai. Whoever...

38:27.836 --> 38:28.493
Thanks.

38:28.646 --> 38:31.191
Well, I'm going get my stuff together. We need to leave soon.

38:31.313 --> 38:33.402
- Tell Gary I went back to your place. 
- I'll do that.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.098
See you.

38:44.145 --> 38:47.130
Gone for the rest of the night. We're stuck with the rolling pins.

38:47.273 --> 38:49.874
- God! So boring! 
- I am starving.

38:50.093 --> 38:53.203
What? The possibly beef and some sort of cream sauce

38:53.279 --> 38:54.442
did nothing to curb your appetite?

38:54.682 --> 38:56.659
Do you want to start with burgers or do a cart-to-cart attack?

38:56.834 --> 38:59.689
There's two of us. I think we can accomplish both goals.

38:59.848 --> 39:01.543
I'm going to get the burgers, you hit the carts.

39:01.635 --> 39:02.624
- I'll meet you by the bonfire. 
- Okay.

39:03.458 --> 39:05.450
- T.J. 
- Hi, you're here. Cool.

39:05.547 --> 39:08.452
Yeah, so, Liz is back at my place getting your stuff,

39:08.534 --> 39:10.544
- she just wanted me to tell you. 
- Okay. Thanks.

39:11.450 --> 39:14.922
So look, I kind of heard you guys talking,

39:15.029 --> 39:18.925
and things seem to be going pretty good for Liz which is different,

39:19.038 --> 39:22.529
and a nice change, and I know that you guys are thinking about moving here,

39:22.786 --> 39:27.266
and I just wanted you to know, it's okay by me.

39:27.743 --> 39:30.042
Okay. I didn't realize we needed your permission.

39:30.247 --> 39:33.534
Oh, no. You don't.

39:33.651 --> 39:34.879
Maybe you misunderstood me here.

39:35.127 --> 39:39.002
I was just trying to say that I assumed because my sister has a history with guys,

39:39.165 --> 39:41.398
you know, that, you know, you were like the others.

39:41.839 --> 39:44.414
But, you seem like a pretty good guy.

39:44.628 --> 39:46.697
Thanks. You're a dick.

39:49.953 --> 39:51.541
So, I just heard the tail end of that conversation

39:51.658 --> 39:53.487
and I'm assuming you haven't changed your name to Richard?

39:53.587 --> 39:55.448
Long, long story. I'll tell you later,

39:55.549 --> 39:58.156
but here's a teaser: the word Etch-A-Sketch comes up.

39:58.320 --> 39:58.996
I'm hooked.

40:00.388 --> 40:01.289
You're all dressed up.

40:01.628 --> 40:02.390
Just for you.

40:03.266 --> 40:04.003
You go somewhere?

40:04.295 --> 40:06.942
My parents had a charity event and

40:07.209 --> 40:09.932
they needed a chair filled and who fills a chair better than I?

40:10.059 --> 40:10.941
No one comes to mind.

40:11.397 --> 40:13.609
So, did Jess leave yet?

40:14.295 --> 40:19.015
I stopped by Gypsy's earlier and she was just about done then, so probably.

40:19.450 --> 40:21.202
- No good-byes? 
- No.

40:21.330 --> 40:24.228
Liz has a feeling about him, though. She thinks he's gonna be fine.

40:25.565 --> 40:26.798
- He could be. 
- Yeah.

40:28.671 --> 40:29.393
Oh, hey,

40:32.359 --> 40:32.998
here.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.008
Pretty.

40:39.655 --> 40:42.609
Liz made them yesterday. She wanted you to have them.

40:43.725 --> 40:46.433
Oh, great. Well, be sure to tell her thanks for me.

40:46.572 --> 40:47.157
I will.

40:55.510 --> 40:57.334
- There. 
- Thank you for your business.

40:57.461 --> 40:59.336
- Do not come again. 
- Not likely.

41:28.391 --> 41:31.028
- I get to leave first! 
- Rory, wait! Stop!

41:31.163 --> 41:32.437
No, you don't get to walk away!

41:32.774 --> 41:35.664
- Hold on! 
- My town! I leave!

41:35.765 --> 41:37.460
I just wanna--where are you going?

41:37.669 --> 41:39.599
- None of your business! 
- We look like idiots.

41:39.702 --> 41:41.350
- I don't care! 
- Stop running!

41:41.857 --> 41:43.527
- Stop following! 
- Oh, come on!

41:44.151 --> 41:45.427
Go away, I'm leaving!

41:45.840 --> 41:47.315
- Rory, stop! 
- Why?

41:47.504 --> 41:48.549
Because I wanna talk to you.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.980
About what? What do you want to talk to me about?

41:51.432 --> 41:53.460
When did you learn to run like that?

41:53.793 --> 41:55.773
You know, I have actually thought about this moment.

41:55.989 --> 41:58.394
A lot. What would Jess say to me I ever saw him again?

41:58.493 --> 42:02.097
I mean, he just took off, no note, no call, nothing, how could he explain that?

42:02.200 --> 42:05.388
And then a year goes by. No word, nothing,

42:05.487 --> 42:08.384
so he couldn't possibly have a good excuse for that, right?

42:08.667 --> 42:11.209
I have imagined hundreds of different scenarios

42:11.292 --> 42:14.119
with a hundred different great last parting lines,

42:14.215 --> 42:16.766
and I have to tell you that I am actually very curious

42:16.874 --> 42:18.292
to see which way this is going to go.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.512
Could we sit down?

42:21.821 --> 42:23.713
No. You wanted to talk, so talk.

42:24.262 --> 42:25.327
What do you have to say to me?

42:30.499 --> 42:31.409
I love you.
