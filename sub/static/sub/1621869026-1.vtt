There's three feet

28:34.531 --> 28:37.167
They'd have to be
right above us to hear.

28:43.908 --> 28:45.609
What is it?
Some kind of...

28:47.377 --> 28:50.681
Some kind of feedback
from the microphone?

we could in the house.

30:09.027 --> 30:10.727

30:14.766 --> 30:17.367
It was when she
started screaming...

30:18.870 --> 30:20.504
we had to come here.

30:23.908 --> 30:25.475
That was smart.

30:27.979 --> 30:29.546
