WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:01.435 --> 00:02.203
- Another body
at Yates' burial ground.

00:03.537 --> 00:05.473
- Someone committed
this horrific crime

00:05.506 --> 00:07.841
to piggyback it onto crimes
I've been accused of.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.976
- You know who the killer is.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.611
- Dr. Carl Rudnick.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.846
- Accusing the Deputy Chief ME
of rape and murder?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.815
- Oh, you can't think that I had
anything to do with this.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.618
- Carl Rudnick,
you're under arrest.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.653
- Something happened to Susie.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.389
She was supposed to call
this morning.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.091
Rudnick's still in custody,
isn't he?

00:23.124 --> 00:25.126
- No, he made bail last night.

00:25.159 --> 00:29.430
- We're not sure it's Susie.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.798
- We are now.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.640
male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:39.673 --> 00:43.144
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.479
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:45.513 --> 00:47.481
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:47.515 --> 00:48.982
are members of an elite squad

00:49.016 --> 00:50.984
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.454
These are their stories.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.390
- What the hell
is going on here?

00:56.424 --> 00:57.691
- Exigent circumstances.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.127
- Oh, nice try.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.295
I don't hear
anyone screaming for help.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.165
You have a warrant
to search Dr. Rudnick's house?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.633
- We had one yesterday.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.502
- And now you need a new one.
- Really, Rita?

01:08.536 --> 01:11.505
- We don't know
that Dr. Rudnick was involved.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.873
- Where's your client, Rita?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.575
- I haven't heard from him.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.911
- He is the suspect
in this murder, okay?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.148
You hear from him,
you better let us know.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.750
- The only legal obligation
I have

01:22.783 --> 01:24.952
is to make sure
that he shows up at trial.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.188
- Wow. You're claiming
attorney-client privilege

01:27.221 --> 01:30.291
for a psychopath
who's on the run,

01:30.324 --> 01:31.392
who gutted a woman.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.294
- I have no knowledge of that,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.929
and I have no knowledge of
any future acts he may commit.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.531
- His car is missing.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.032
He's not answering
his telephone.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.202
We need to search
this house now.

01:41.235 --> 01:45.673
- And you can as soon
as you get a warrant.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.020
- Fin's at Real Time
checking traffic cams.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.722
Sarge is
at Rudnick's town house.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.424
There's no sign of this guy.
He's in the wind.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.360
- Yeah, well, he murdered
and dismembered Susie Frain.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.595
I wouldn't have
stuck around either.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.431
We're still missing
a left leg.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.567
[camera shutter clicking]

02:17.238 --> 02:18.939
Ah, that's a calf.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.709
- Sawed off at the left knee,
not a lot of blood.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.745
- [gags, groans softly]

02:24.778 --> 02:26.614
- You guys got this, right?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.549
- [clears throat]
Yeah, give me one second.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.817
Oh.
[vomits]

02:29.850 --> 02:32.920
- Oh, easy.
You all right?

02:32.953 --> 02:36.724
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.563
I am going
to drive us back, okay?

02:42.596 --> 02:45.466
[camera shutter clicking]

02:45.499 --> 02:47.034
- 12 hours
after Rudnick posts bail,

02:47.067 --> 02:48.736
a potential prosecution witness

02:48.769 --> 02:50.338
is found in pieces
with the morning tide?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.240
- We're well aware
of the problem.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.707
- Counselor.
- Where the hell is he?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.243
- This is all we know, okay?

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
He was last seen posting bond
at 8:00 p.m. last night.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.812
- Uber driver confirms
dropping him off

02:58.846 --> 03:00.080
at his Harlem town house.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.283
So, sometime between last night
and this morning,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.884
he goes
to Susie Frain's apartment,

03:03.917 --> 03:05.453
he dismembers her,
he bags the body,

03:05.486 --> 03:06.787
dumps her in the water
at Fort Tilden,

03:06.820 --> 03:07.921
and then he disappears.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.390
- We've got a BOLO
out on his car,

03:09.423 --> 03:10.658
his credit, his bank cards.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.892
So far, no hits.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.160
- No sightings,
no traffic cams.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.595
Does everyone know
he dresses in drag?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.497
- We've alerted state troopers
and the FBI.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.266
- Oh, they already know.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.133
The ME's office,
the mayor's office,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.336
the people in my office...
[cell phone vibrating]

03:22.370 --> 03:23.904
People are falling over
themselves to point fingers.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.373
- Okay, I get it.
It's a mess, all right?

03:25.406 --> 03:28.108
No leave, no vacation, no--

03:28.141 --> 03:30.811
- Yes, I'll hold
for the governor.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.046
Find him.
- Okay.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.350
- Wow. Somebody
needs a vacation.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.118
- You can't blame him.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.288
I mean, the guy jumps bail,
and then he kills our witness.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.489
- Speaking of,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.591
we need to notify Yates
that his fiancée is dead.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.359
- Look, that's not a priority
right now.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.494
He'll find out on the news.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.297
- I know he will,
but the photo, Sergeant,

03:49.297 --> 03:51.799
the photo that Rudnick sent to
Susie pretending he was Lena--

03:51.832 --> 03:54.702
CSU tore her house apart.
They couldn't find it anywhere.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.304
- Yeah, of course
they couldn't.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.138
That's why Rudnick went
to her house in the first place.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.873
- So check her phone records.
Find out if she called Rudnick.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.175
- What, do you think she was
using that photo for blackmail?

04:02.209 --> 04:05.479
You know she did not come up
with that idea on her own.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.180
- Which is why
I need to talk to Yates.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.949
You know he's more open
when it's just the two of us.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.684
- Nice try, Rollins.

04:10.718 --> 04:14.054
[telephones ringing
in the background]

04:16.724 --> 04:18.559
- [sighs]
Susie.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.696
Can I see the body?

04:22.730 --> 04:25.232
- That's not going to be
possible, Dr. Yates.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.368
- Are you sure it was her?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.036
- We're sure.
I'm sorry.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.706
- So we were hoping, uh,
to talk to you

04:32.740 --> 04:36.009
about your last conversation
with Susie Frain.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.145
- Yes, of course.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.080
How did Rudnick kill her?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.582
- Still waiting
on the autopsy.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.884
- You are?

04:43.917 --> 04:47.020
Could you ask the ME
to test her HCG levels?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.389
- Excuse me?

04:48.422 --> 04:51.359
- I'd like to know
whether Susie was pregnant.

04:51.359 --> 04:55.363
That afternoon in April before
I was arrested,

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
we made love.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.367
I could sense
that she was ovulating.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.569
When we had our conjugal,

05:01.602 --> 05:04.605
she agreed to take
a pregnancy test.

05:06.774 --> 05:11.379
It's quite possible that I was
going to be a father...

05:11.379 --> 05:13.547
and he took that from me.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.926
[dramatic music]

06:09.470 --> 06:09.603
.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.238
- You got something?
- Yeah, I got a hold of Fin.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.075
He and TARU have been going
through Rudnick's computers,

06:15.108 --> 06:17.277
finances, flagging every credit
card that they could find.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.446
- Okay, any hits?
- Not yet.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.613
But they did find this.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.282
So Dr. Crazy's been wiring
money from a trust

06:22.315 --> 06:23.617
to four different
personal accounts

06:23.651 --> 06:25.052
under four different names.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.220
- So contact these people.
- We're trying, Sarge.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.457
But as of now, their only
known addresses are PO boxes.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.625
I mean, we can't find
any employers, phone listings.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.527
- Okay, so they're
false fronts.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.463
- I just got something
from the DMV.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.064
See that Terry Fish account
up there?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.365
I just found a Teresa Fish

06:38.466 --> 06:40.468
that has an apartment
in the same zip as that PO box.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.302
- Great.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.737
- Oh.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.905
Rudnick's a blonde now.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.341
- Teresa got her license
in October of last year.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.310
I'll put a BOLO out.
- You know what? I'll do that.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.812
You two,
get up to that apartment.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.648
If we get lucky,
Rudnick may be hiding there.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.488
- Hey, you all right?

07:00.488 --> 07:02.556
- Why wouldn't I be?
- I don't know.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.857
Usually, you're two steps
ahead of me,

07:03.891 --> 07:05.726
and I've never seen you queasy
at a crime scene before.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.529
- Yeah, I had a bad bagel
yesterday.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.897
I'm totally fine.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.004
- I wondered if something
happened to poor Terry.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.741
I ain't seen her in a while
here, maybe since April.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.243
Is she okay?
We miss her around here.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.012
- You know her?
You talk to her much?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.514
- Is that a joke?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.148
- Does it look
like either of us are laughing?

07:28.181 --> 07:30.417
- It sounds like a joke.

07:30.518 --> 07:34.054
Terry's mute, deaf too.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.723
She used to write
me little notes, you know,

07:35.756 --> 07:39.359
if she needed something,
but never a complaint.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.630
She paid her rent a year
in advance.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.866
[knock at door]
Terry!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.868
Oh, what am I doing?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.237
It's not like she can hear me.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.825
- You lay this new floor
in here?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.460
- I told you she was
a good tenant.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.228
She must have put
that in herself.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.564
- Right.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.586
Carisi.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.721
- Hey, I found more wigs
and floral print dresses,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.289
lots of them.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.158
- It's red hair,
just like Rachel Groves'.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.494
And these look
like cutting marks to you?

08:47.595 --> 08:50.130
- Totally.
I'll call CSU.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.235
- I got your message
about Rudnick's aliases

08:55.268 --> 08:57.304
so I rechecked
his Jane Doe autopsies.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.306
The last one
was in October.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.743
50-year-old homeless woman
found dead on the E train,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.144
listed as natural causes.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.413
- Never ID'd.

09:06.446 --> 09:10.450
- Rudnick's paperwork says "no
match on fingerprints or DNA."

09:10.483 --> 09:12.252
But I got a print hit

09:12.285 --> 09:17.090
on a New York City food stamp
application--Teresa Fish.

09:17.124 --> 09:20.327
- Rudnick wanted to make sure
that nobody would miss her

09:20.360 --> 09:22.495
so he could steal
her identity.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.498
- Identity thief,
rapist, killer--

09:25.532 --> 09:27.234
the damage
he's done to this office,

09:27.267 --> 09:28.836
it makes me furious.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.337
- Not to mention they
brought him up from Dade County

09:30.370 --> 09:32.472
instead of giving you
that promotion.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.275
You know,
you should reapply.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.912
- Before I do that,
I need to rerun DNA and prints

09:38.946 --> 09:42.249
on every body he's ever sent
to Potter's Field.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.351
- [sighs]

09:44.384 --> 09:46.987
Thank you, Melinda.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.689
- You were right.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.859
One can see pronounced gouges
on this bottom layer.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.094
- Any guess
on what the implement was?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.096
- I'd say
it's a large, flat blade,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.866
maybe a cleaver.
- Oh.

09:58.899 --> 10:03.603
- Aha, it's a pattern,
white marks, strokes.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.039
- So he tried to wipe off the
blood, maybe what, with bleach?

10:06.073 --> 10:09.042
- Yeah, but he didn't
get it all, hence the glow.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.684
- [grunts]

10:16.717 --> 10:18.886
Okay.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.125
Dried blood.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.560
- Quite apparent something
barbarous happened here.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.829
- Yeah.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.197
- Hey, you up
for a flight?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.499
- No, not really.
- Tough luck.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.201
Our plane leaves
in 40 minutes.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.236
Rudnick just got picked up
in Syracuse for shoplifting.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.570
Take a look.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.210
- We ran the prints,
but the system was down.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.678
By the time we got a match,
he was gone.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.079
He said his flight
was leaving in an hour.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.581
- So you let him walk?
Great.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.483
- We thought we had
a 50-year-old cross-dresser

10:50.517 --> 10:53.186
near tears because his mother
was dying in Canada.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.088
He stole a frickin' box
of Coffee Nips.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.223
- All right, I get it.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.692
- We did give him a desk ticket.
- Good for you!

10:58.726 --> 11:00.393
- Listen, Rollins,
their system was down.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.629
He said his mother
was dying.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.431
All right,
we've had a long day.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.933
- The good news is, no one
with that name got on a plane,

11:05.966 --> 11:07.167
train, or rented a car.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.435
- Did you check
his other aliases?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.070
'Cause he has
at least four.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.739
- We did. Look, we got
this entire town locked down.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.974
He's not going anywhere.
- Planes, trains, automobiles.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.242
Did you check buses?

11:15.275 --> 11:16.944
A Meta Bus left an hour
ago for Buffalo.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.345
He could walk to Canada
from there.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.446
- Yeah.
- What time does it arrive?

11:19.479 --> 11:20.748
- It just left Rochester.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.182
It's going to be there
in two and a half hours.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.085
- We're going
to need a squad car now.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.758
- Here comes our bus.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.830
- You're the detectives
from New York?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.531
- Yeah.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.533
- Bob Hencamp, Buffalo PD.
- Dominick Carisi.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.835
This is Detective Rollins.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.103
We call her Sunny.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.839
- Sunny Rollins?
Okay.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.941
Troopers picked up the bus
on I-90 an hour ago,

11:47.975 --> 11:49.542
followed at a discreet distance.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.911
- Well,
he's still on board.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.380
- There was an E. Howard credit
card purchase in Syracuse.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.816
Bus didn't make any stops
between Rochester and here.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.517
- Okay, well,
let's do this thing.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.253
Nice and easy, all right?
We don't want to spook him.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.092
- Dr. Rudnick.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.927
- This is your guy?
- I'm Ellie Howard,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.796
and I fully intend
to pay my fine for shoplifting.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.463
- Ms. Howard, stop.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.965
Why don't you come
with us, all right?

12:11.999 --> 12:14.634
We'll sort this out.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.136
- Hands behind your back,
please.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.905
- [sighs]
Is that really necessary?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.507
- Let him do his job.

12:22.509 --> 12:26.279
[handcuffs clicking]

12:33.854 --> 12:33.987
.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.455
- So you got a cross-dressing
rapist, murderer

12:36.356 --> 12:38.158
in your ME's office.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.828
You guys down in New York City
really are progressive.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.462
- Did he say anything?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.831
- He bitched
when we searched him.

12:43.864 --> 12:47.500
Maybe because he had a money
belt with 64,000 in cash.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.169
- So why is he shoplifting
Coffee Nips, then?

12:49.202 --> 12:52.840
- Well, that's
the $64,000 question.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.242
Just give me a minute
to finish paperwork,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.911
and he's all yours.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.947
- Do you have
a cause of death?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.681
- Manner, homicide.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.017
No one ends up
like this accidently,

13:04.051 --> 13:06.486
Cause of death,
exsanguination.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.055
- So she bled out
when he cut her up.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.424
- No, the dismemberment
occurred post-mortem.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.094
The problem is I can't find
the initial wound.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.729
Most likely trauma
to the femoral vein or artery--

13:16.763 --> 13:18.665
stab wound, maybe gunshot.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.333
- To the missing left thigh?

13:20.367 --> 13:23.770
- I would guess that's
why Rudnick made it disappear.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
There's something else.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.075
Susie's tox screen
came back clean,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.543
but her HCG levels were high.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.079
She was pregnant.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.219
- We aren't actually
going to drive

13:39.252 --> 13:40.753
all the way back
to Manhattan, are we?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.222
- Shut up.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.957
You took the bus
up here anyway, right?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.459
- Yes, when I was traveling
incognito.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.895
- What were you
thinking, anyway,

13:47.928 --> 13:49.729
skipping out
on a $2 million bail?

13:49.762 --> 13:50.898
- Well, what were
they thinking?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.765
They charged me with two
murders, then let me go.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.236
Who wouldn't run?
[cell phone ringing]

13:56.269 --> 13:58.471
- Hey, Sarge.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.907
Yeah, we're making
pretty good time,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.475
as long
as we don't get pulled over.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.476
We should be back around--

14:03.510 --> 14:05.612
Wait. Hold on.
Let me check my app.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.280
- Noon.
- Wait. Hold on.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.615
- Noon.
- Noon.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.951
All right,
we'll be back around noon.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.054
All right.
Copy that.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.290
They found his car.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.525
- Why are you whispering?

14:18.558 --> 14:19.960
Rudnick, they found your car.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.230
- Well, give yourselves
a gold star.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.832
- We sure it's Rudnick's?

14:25.933 --> 14:27.567
- Plates and all identifiers
are stripped,

14:27.600 --> 14:28.936
but we got the VIN
off the engine block.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.470
- Okay, so why here?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.439
- The train to the plane
is a block away.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.574
- Oh, so had
we found this any earlier,

14:34.607 --> 14:36.009
we would have been
searching JFK.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.378
- While he got across the border
on his Meta Bus.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.148
He's not stupid,
but he was in a rush.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.515
He left blood.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.651
Now, it's just a trace,

14:44.684 --> 14:46.954
but that's all I need.
- Great.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.321
I'll call Barba.

14:48.355 --> 14:52.993
- A young man
like yourself working at SVU.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.527
That has to be depressing.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.630
- You work in a morgue.
- I find peace in that.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.232
I bring closure to people.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.434
- Yeah,
when you're not killing them.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.004
- Death, in its way,
is the ultimate closure.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.639
- Is that a confession?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.508
- Thanks.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.280
Sure you don't want
something more substantial?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.714
- Mm, yes, I'm sure.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.018
Do you people think
about what you eat?

15:18.051 --> 15:20.187
- Nope.
- You should.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.688
All that cholesterol--

15:21.721 --> 15:23.456
I could tell you
both right now what your livers

15:23.490 --> 15:25.492
are going to look like when
they're eventually on the slab.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.395
- You know what?
Don't.

15:30.197 --> 15:33.300
- I don't mean to be a nuisance,
but may I use the facilities?

15:35.202 --> 15:37.204
- [scoffs]

15:38.871 --> 15:40.307
- [sighs]

15:40.340 --> 15:42.775
- Whoa.
Hey, it's still occupied.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.144
Hey, look, it's my uncle.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.214
I'll see if I can hurry
him along, okay?

15:48.315 --> 15:51.184
- Well, This is unfortunate.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.854
They think I killed that woman
and cut her up.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.158
I don't understand why.

15:58.191 --> 16:02.029
Of course, I do understand.
It's still offensive.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.530
So are they.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.532
[sighs]

16:05.565 --> 16:09.369
Quiet, Doctor, quiet.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.038
Good man.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.573
[toilet flushes]

16:15.575 --> 16:17.944
- Hey, Doc, come on,
we got to go.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.712
- Oh.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.715
Could I trouble you
for my phone?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.085
I need to call my lawyer.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.388
- Mr. Barba?
- Uh-huh?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.223
[scoffs]

16:30.257 --> 16:32.892
Rita...

16:32.925 --> 16:35.062
you have one hell
of a client.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.096
Kills a pregnant witness

16:36.129 --> 16:37.930
and tries to cross the border
in a dress.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.499
- Dr. Rudnick was out on bond.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.768
He was simply taking
in the sights of Buffalo.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.071
- Uh-huh.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.939
We have a DNA match
from Rachel Groves' hair

16:46.973 --> 16:50.610
and blood on the kitchen floor
of an apartment that he leased.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.446
- He's an ME.
He autopsied her body.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.582
It could be
cross-contamination.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.584
- Well, he didn't autopsy
Susie Frain,

16:57.617 --> 16:59.152
and we found her blood
in his car.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.753
- They were old friends.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.322
He gave her a ride.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.923
She bled from a paper cut.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.925
Both those cases
were circumstantial,

17:05.958 --> 17:09.429
and don't get me started
on a 13-year-old body in a wall.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.598
- So why are you here, Rita?

17:11.631 --> 17:14.267
- You have an ME accused
of being a serial killer.

17:14.301 --> 17:18.738
The last thing your bosses want
is a long, drawn-out trial.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.109
And these headlines--
how are your migraines?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.450
- Your solution is?

17:30.483 --> 17:34.121
- Dr. Rudnick pleads to one
count of tampering with evidence

17:34.154 --> 17:37.457
and one count
of unlawful disposal of a body.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.228
This goes away
as quietly as possible.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.795
- Misdemeanors?

17:42.829 --> 17:46.466
He killed three women.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.135
I can offer manslaughter,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.369
20 years on each,
served concurrently.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.937
- A public defender
can get as much.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.140
He is paying
for more than that.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.976
- I hope there's enough money
in the world, Rita.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.147
I really do.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.949
- You better hope
you don't get a conviction,

18:02.982 --> 18:04.484
because if you do,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.154
every case Dr. Rudnick touched
will be subject to an appeal,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.156
starting with Greg Yates.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.996
- I was so worried...

18:17.029 --> 18:20.700
about what might happen
to Susie.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.169
She was always so trusting.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.505
She never saw the dark side
of people.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.174
- Like Dr. Rudnick.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.747
What did she say to you
when you last spoke?

18:34.781 --> 18:39.519
- She firmly believed
that if she asked him,

18:39.552 --> 18:42.922
he would work to set me free
in exchange for the photo.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.758
I knew she was walking
into the lion's den,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.059
but she wouldn't listen.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.461
I...

18:48.495 --> 18:51.631
I think she wanted me out
to be there when she gave birth.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.500
- So she told you
she was pregnant.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.769
- No, she didn't need to.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.638
I knew.

18:58.671 --> 19:02.209
She had
a slightly different scent...

19:02.242 --> 19:04.511
like you do.

19:21.261 --> 19:21.394
.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.289
- Ms. Calhoun,
are you ready to proceed?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.692
- We are, Your Honor.
- Mr. Barba.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.860
- Your Honor, in addition

19:53.893 --> 19:55.362
to the two standing charges
of murder one,

19:55.395 --> 19:58.531
the defendant is now charged
with the murder of Susie Frain.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.967
- Dr. Rudnick,
how do you plead?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.769
- I apologize for being late,
Your Honor.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.871
John Buchanan
for the defense.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.339
My client pleads not guilty.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.074
- I know who you are,
Counselor,

20:08.107 --> 20:10.443
but I'm not a fan
of courtroom theatrics.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.545
What's going on here,
Ms. Calhoun?

20:12.579 --> 20:16.316
- I just need a moment
to confer with my client.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.285
- So he is still your client.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.353
- He is, Your Honor. Dr. Rudnick
has retained us both.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.554
- You have?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.556
- Rita, the state
saw fit to double down.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.358
I thought it prudent
to do the same.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.159
Now, you both have
my complete confidence.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.061
- May we proceed?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.597
People on bail.
- Remand.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.865
While out on bail,
the defendant murdered

20:32.899 --> 20:35.368
and dismembered
a prosecution witness.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.703
- Another wild accusation.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.339
- More to the point, he is free
to travel within the state.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.574
He has violated
no court order.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.510
- That is absolutely correct.
- Enough, Doctor.

20:43.543 --> 20:47.246
Your bail was a privilege
that has just been revoked.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.081
You are remanded to Rikers.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.385
- In that case, I have a motion
to separate these three charges.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.720
- As do I.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.456
- Coordinate,
and I'll let the presiding judge

20:56.489 --> 20:57.690
know what he's in for.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.359
Good day.
[gavel bangs]

21:04.331 --> 21:05.565
- Hey.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.733
Missed you in court.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.569
- Yeah.
- You look green.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.404
Have a ginger ale.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.239
[can rattles]

21:13.340 --> 21:15.107
- I'm good.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.909
[can opens]

21:16.943 --> 21:18.845
- So have you told
anybody yet?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.621
- Nope.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.493
I just found out.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.098
And not that it's any
of your business,

21:39.131 --> 21:40.800
but, you know,
it's not Nick's, so...

21:40.833 --> 21:43.102
- Okay.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.604
What are you going to do?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.939
- I'm not going to do anything.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.742
- Well, you might want
to tell the sarge.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.151
- Whiskey.
Does that mean it's bad news?

21:59.185 --> 22:01.921
- [sighs] Rudnick's dream team
just got their first win.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.222
The judge granted
their motion

22:03.255 --> 22:04.557
to separate out
the three charges.

22:04.591 --> 22:07.059
- How?
There's a clear pattern.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.861
- [sighs]
Not really.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.398
The murders are spread out
over 13 years,

22:11.398 --> 22:13.400
and the motives
are arguably different.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.667
Lena was his fiancée.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.603
Susie was blackmailing him,

22:16.636 --> 22:19.038
and Rachel--she was just easy
pickings, crime of opportunity.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.607
- Okay, I get it.
So the judge thought

22:20.640 --> 22:22.041
that linking the three
together would be

22:22.074 --> 22:25.177
more prejudicial than probative.
- Prejudicial than probative.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.946
- Okay.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.280
So what do you need from me?

22:28.314 --> 22:31.751
- A thigh,
to establish cause of death.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.453
Susie Frain
is our strongest case.

22:33.486 --> 22:37.023
- The thigh is gone,
but you don't need it.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.691
He cut her up, Barba.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.428
I don't care how good
those lawyers think they are.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.597
When the jury sees
what he did to that woman...

22:44.631 --> 22:46.533
he's done.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.438
- [sighs]

22:53.440 --> 22:55.307
- Were you able
to identify the victim?

22:55.341 --> 22:57.710
- Yes.
In another bag we opened,

22:57.744 --> 23:01.648
we found the decapitated head
of Susie Frain.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.850
It was...

23:03.883 --> 23:05.718
one of the most
gruesome crime scenes

23:05.752 --> 23:07.019
that I've ever witnessed.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.655
- Objection.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.458
These injuries occurred
after Ms. Frain's death.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.560
They have no bearing
on the murder charge

23:13.593 --> 23:15.828
and serve only
to prejudice this jury.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.464
- Overruled.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.965
I'll allow up to a point,

23:18.998 --> 23:20.567
and I want to remind the jury

23:20.600 --> 23:22.469
that you're here to determine
the facts of the murder

23:22.469 --> 23:26.038
and not what happened
to the body post-mortem.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.876
- Sergeant Benson, the body
on the beach was Susie Frain?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.811
- Yes, without a doubt.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.880
DNA links all the pieces.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.815
- Nothing further.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.491
- Good morning, Sergeant.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.258
When you first met Ms. Frain,

23:46.292 --> 23:49.028
it was in connection with
another murder case, correct?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.497
- It was.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.665
- The brutal kidnapping,
rape, and murder

23:52.699 --> 23:57.336
of a Chicago PD employee by
Ms. Frain's fiancée, Greg Yates.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.571
- Yes.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.339
- Did Ms. Frain

24:00.372 --> 24:03.910
maintain his innocence even
after Dr. Yates' conviction?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.411
- Objection.
Relevance.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.313
- Your Honor,
I intend to show a direct line

24:07.346 --> 24:12.084
between Ms. Frain's pathological
desire to clear her fiancée

24:12.118 --> 24:14.587
and the events
that led to her death.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.523
- I'll allow.

24:16.523 --> 24:20.092
- Did Ms. Frain ever become
aware that Dr. Carl Rudnick

24:20.126 --> 24:23.029
was the Deputy Chief ME
for Manhattan

24:23.062 --> 24:27.199
who had supervised the autopsies
of Dr. Yates' victims?

24:27.233 --> 24:28.768
- Yes, and I know
that it's your job

24:28.801 --> 24:30.336
to try to make a connection
between the two--

24:30.369 --> 24:33.372
- Well, so let me do my job.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.341
And after that,

24:35.374 --> 24:39.045
did you and ADA Barba

24:39.078 --> 24:40.880
helpfully arrange
for a conjugal visit

24:40.913 --> 24:44.283
between Ms. Frain
and Dr. Yates?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.052
- We did.

24:46.085 --> 24:49.656
- Once reunited, did they both
spontaneously accuse Dr. Rudnick

24:49.689 --> 24:50.890
of a series of crimes?

24:50.923 --> 24:52.191
- Yes, but there were also

24:52.224 --> 24:53.626
two other women
who had been murdered.

24:53.660 --> 24:57.664
- So is it possible
that they were colluding

24:57.697 --> 25:01.601
to incriminate Dr. Rudnick
in hopes of discrediting him

25:01.634 --> 25:05.304
and thus bolstering
Yates' chance for an appeal.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.239
- Objection.
Speculation.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.375
- Is it?

25:09.408 --> 25:11.678
Withdrawn.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.913
Nothing further.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.182
Thank you, Sergeant.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.491
- Susie Frain was cooperating

25:25.592 --> 25:27.660
with a separate investigation
into Dr. Rudnick.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.095
- Objection, Your Honor.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.763
- This line goes directly
to motive.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.833
- I'll allow
but only in that context.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.602
- In what way was Ms. Frain
cooperating?

25:35.602 --> 25:37.336
- She was searching
for photos

25:37.369 --> 25:39.972
which we believed would provide
evidence against Dr. Rudnick,

25:40.006 --> 25:41.107
but she was murdered

25:41.140 --> 25:42.842
before she had the chance
to deliver them to us.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.445
- Did you find these photos
in her home?

25:46.478 --> 25:49.015
- No, but as the crime-scene
pictures show--

25:49.048 --> 25:51.417
- People's exhibit 47A,
47B, Your Honor.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.653
- Objection.
This is prejudicial.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.921
- It's a crime scene.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.690
- Agreed. Overruled.

25:57.724 --> 26:01.193
- So you can see
her ransacked memento boxes,

26:01.227 --> 26:03.630
and we also later
obtained security footage

26:03.630 --> 26:05.031
from her mini-storage facility.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.365
- People's exhibit 48A.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.167
- Where you can see the victim

26:08.200 --> 26:11.537
had retrieved those same boxes
the day before she was murdered,

26:11.638 --> 26:13.339
so we believe
whoever killed her

26:13.372 --> 26:14.941
took the incriminating photos
with them.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.743
- Objection.
Pure speculation.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.879
- Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.250
- Nothing further.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.652
- You just said
that Ms. Frain

26:25.652 --> 26:27.253
had agreed to search
for these photos.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.722
Is there any reason
to think that she found them?

26:29.756 --> 26:31.523
- Sergeant Benson and I
were informed of that fact

26:31.557 --> 26:32.759
by Dr. Yates.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.426
- Dr. Yates.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.396
You mean
the convicted murderer?

26:37.429 --> 26:41.934
I see from the prison logs
that you visited Dr. Yates

26:41.968 --> 26:43.770
a half a dozen times
in the last few weeks.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.673
- I was hoping he could help me
with a number of unsolved cases.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.875
- Two of those visits
you undertook on your own.

26:48.908 --> 26:52.578
Is that common practice
for a female NYPD detective?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.082
- He was more open to me
that way.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.450
- So he confided in you.

26:58.484 --> 27:02.554
Did he also enlist you to help
him get a conjugal visit

27:02.588 --> 27:04.356
with Ms. Frain?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.492
- Sure.
- Given that, it seems fair

27:06.525 --> 27:10.062
to say that you had
a relationship with Mr. Yates.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.231
- Not in the way you mean.
- Oh, how do I mean it?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.532
- Objection.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.301
- I'll rephrase.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.836
Did anyone in your squad

27:16.869 --> 27:19.471
ever think that Mr. Yates
was toying with you,

27:19.505 --> 27:22.008
attempting to implicate
Dr. Rudnick

27:22.041 --> 27:25.177
in an effort
to exonerate himself?

27:25.211 --> 27:29.015
- All informants
have an agenda.

27:29.048 --> 27:32.318
Good detectives...

27:32.351 --> 27:34.253
evaluate their credibility.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.723
- Your answer is yes, then?

27:36.723 --> 27:38.057
- Objection.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.159
- Withdrawn.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.628
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

27:47.466 --> 27:50.436
- Hey, you okay?

27:50.469 --> 27:53.405
- Yeah, I thought it was Rudnick
on trial, not Yates or me.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.775
- A lot of pressure up there.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.377
- It is.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.747
Also, um...

28:00.780 --> 28:03.449
I'm pregnant.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.484
- Wow.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.254
- Not Nick's.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.289
- Okay.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.291
Thanks for telling me.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.660
- And I know with the squad
being shorthanded,

28:14.761 --> 28:16.162
it's not the best time for me,

28:16.195 --> 28:17.429
but I want to promise you

28:17.463 --> 28:20.132
this is not going to affect
my ability to do my job.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.534
- Actually, it is,
Amanda, you know.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.203
- Yeah, of course,
but I just meant--

28:24.236 --> 28:26.438
- Look, I know you're going
to fight me on this,

28:26.472 --> 28:28.107
but as soon
as the Department hears,

28:28.140 --> 28:30.209
they're going
to put you on restricted duty.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.780
- Can we wait to tell them?

28:33.780 --> 28:36.682
I just want to work
until the last minute.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.819
- I know what a hard worker
you are.

28:39.852 --> 28:43.322
It's a really good thing,
'cause...

28:43.355 --> 28:46.525
because being a single mom
is, uh...

28:46.558 --> 28:49.295
it's not easy.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.797
- Well, I may not be on my own.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.866
My mom might actually
move up to New York.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.467
- Good, good.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.136
- Yeah.

28:57.169 --> 29:01.540
- Well, I want you to know
I'm--I'm really happy for you.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.910
And, you know, if you want

29:03.943 --> 29:08.614
or need to talk
about anything...

29:08.647 --> 29:10.316
I'm here.

29:20.860 --> 29:20.993
.

29:21.660 --> 29:22.661
- Susie Frain's cause of death
was exsanguination.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.097
She bled out.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.532
- Yet you were unable
to determine

29:26.565 --> 29:28.467
where the initial wound
was made, Dr. Warner?

29:28.500 --> 29:29.468
- Correct.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.970
I believe it was in the piece

29:31.003 --> 29:34.073
of Susie Frain's thigh
that remains missing.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.842
- What made you come
to that conclusion?

29:35.875 --> 29:38.677
- The lack of blood
in her other body parts.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.980
- And how many
different body parts

29:41.013 --> 29:42.481
were you able to examine?

29:42.514 --> 29:43.482
- Objection.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.051
The prosecution
keeps trying

29:45.084 --> 29:48.087
to poison this jury with what
happened to the victim's body.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.858
- Overruled. But let's
move it along, Mr. Barba.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.593
- Despite being unable
to locate the initial wound,

29:54.626 --> 29:56.095
what did you list
as manner of death?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.429
- Homicide.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.266
No one ends up cut
into pieces like this

30:00.299 --> 30:02.969
after an accidental
or natural death.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.304
- Nothing further.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.673
- Dr. Warner...

30:07.706 --> 30:11.410
both Ms. Frain's
and my client's blood

30:11.443 --> 30:14.280
were found
in Ms. Frain's house.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.782
Isn't that right?
- Yes.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.952
- Defense exhibit 13.

30:19.986 --> 30:24.290
My client had defensive wounds
on his hand and forearms

30:24.323 --> 30:26.125
when you examined him.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.826
- Yes, he did.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.396
However, I can't tell you
how he sustained those injuries.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.899
- Just like you can't tell us
how Ms. Frain

30:32.932 --> 30:34.566
sustained her fatal injury.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.169
- Dr. Rudnick walked
out of that house.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.138
Susie Frain did not.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.474
- And yet your own autopsy can't
determine how she was killed.

30:44.010 --> 30:48.480
Dr. Rudnick was hired as
your supervisor two years ago.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.150
Did you apply
for that position?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.419
- Yes, but that's not--
- Withdrawn.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.955
Nothing further.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.357
- Redirect, Your Honor.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.093
In your opinion,
could Dr. Rudnick's wounds

31:01.127 --> 31:03.930
have been self-inflicted
after he killed Ms. Frain?

31:03.930 --> 31:05.697
- Yes, absolutely.

31:05.731 --> 31:09.001
- Thank you.
Prosecution rests.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.371
- The defense
calls Dr. Carl Rudnick.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.115
Dr. Rudnick, tell the jury
in your own words

31:23.149 --> 31:26.618
what happened the night you went
to Ms. Frain's apartment.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.121
- She attacked me
with a kitchen knife.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.822
There was a struggle.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.760
I killed her accidently
in self-defense.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.033
Dr. Yates
had brainwashed Susie

31:41.067 --> 31:43.235
into believing
I'd been setting him up.

31:43.269 --> 31:46.672
She accused me of tampering with
the autopsies of his victims,

31:46.705 --> 31:48.707
which is patently absurd.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.543
He'd operated
in several disparate states.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.745
And I made the impertinent
mistake of laughing.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.747
- And what did she do?

31:55.781 --> 31:57.549
- She grabbed a knife
and attacked me.

31:57.583 --> 32:02.154
I defended myself, resulting in
these cuts on my hand and arms.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.655
- Could you step down

32:03.689 --> 32:07.726
and demonstrate how you received
those wounds, Dr. Rudnick?

32:07.759 --> 32:08.995
- Objection. Prejudicial.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.829
- What?
How will the jury know

32:10.862 --> 32:13.065
what really happened
if I can't demonstrate?

32:13.099 --> 32:14.633
- Your Honor,
I think a demonstration

32:14.666 --> 32:16.102
could be informative.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.803
- I'll allow it,
but don't milk it.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.095
- Is this how she held it?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.131
- Yes. She pulled the knife
from the butcher block

32:45.164 --> 32:46.298
and swung it down at me.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.034
- Like this?

32:48.034 --> 32:50.136
- Yes, I fended her off
for a moment.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.637
- But she kept coming.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.673
- Unfortunately, I pushed
her wrist on the downward swing.

32:54.706 --> 32:58.177
She put her body weight
into the thrust,

32:58.210 --> 33:01.047
and momentum drove the knife

33:01.047 --> 33:03.549
into her left thigh.

33:03.582 --> 33:07.053
[breathing shakily]

33:07.086 --> 33:09.621
- Doctor...

33:09.655 --> 33:12.358
do you need a moment?

33:12.391 --> 33:14.060
- No.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.228
I'm fine.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.097
Thank you.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.400
Thank you.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.407
[sighs]

33:28.440 --> 33:30.942
- What happened next?

33:30.976 --> 33:32.311
- Well, when I saw the blood,

33:32.344 --> 33:34.746
I knew it had hit
the femoral artery.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.549
I was in shock,
uh, bleeding.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.686
I momentarily lost
consciousness,

33:40.719 --> 33:43.589
and when I came to,
it was too late to save her.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.657
- And then what happened?

33:45.691 --> 33:46.825
- I stitched my cuts,

33:46.858 --> 33:48.827
because I was afraid
to go to the hospital.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.396
- Why was that?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.998
- I felt
if I went in bleeding,

33:53.099 --> 33:55.000
no one would believe
a word I had to say.

33:55.101 --> 33:58.304
- How would you describe
your state of mind?

33:58.337 --> 34:00.106
- I was panicking.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.108
That's why I tried to get rid
of Susie's body.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.775
I'm not proud of that,

34:03.809 --> 34:06.945
but by then, I felt the whole
system had turned against me.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.781
It was fight or flight,
and I chose to flee.

34:09.815 --> 34:13.752
- And when you fled, you
disguised yourself as a woman.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.587
- Everyone was looking
for Carl Rudnick.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.789
No one was looking for Carla.

34:17.823 --> 34:20.492
It seemed to be a good idea
at the time.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.895
- Thank you, Doctor.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.731
- Mr. Barba.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.134
- Dr. Rudnick, are you the
Deputy Chief Medical Examiner

34:28.134 --> 34:29.401
for Manhattan?

34:29.435 --> 34:32.538
- I was.
I believe I'm on leave now.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.673
- As such, you would know
exactly how to mimic

34:34.706 --> 34:36.708
defensive wounds, wouldn't you?

34:36.742 --> 34:37.943
- Are you implying that--

34:37.976 --> 34:41.147
- Yes or no.
- Yes.

34:41.147 --> 34:45.451
- And you would know how
to cut up and dispose of a body.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.419
- An unfortunate area
of expertise

34:47.453 --> 34:50.021
for someone accused of murder,
but it is mine.

34:50.055 --> 34:51.590
- Did you use
a reciprocating saw

34:51.623 --> 34:53.159
and bolt cutter to do so?

34:53.159 --> 34:56.162
People's Exhibit 52--

34:56.162 --> 34:59.431
a receipt for a saw
and bolt cutter...

35:01.767 --> 35:04.002
From Home Depot...

35:04.035 --> 35:08.840
paid with Carl Rudnick's
American Express card at 11:50

35:08.874 --> 35:12.178
on the night Susie Frain
was murdered.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.645
- Yes, luckily, I was
able to make it there

35:13.679 --> 35:15.514
before closing time.
- Ha.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.816
As you said, you knew
exactly what you were doing,

35:17.849 --> 35:19.785
so it is no accident
that the one part

35:19.818 --> 35:21.487
of Susie Frain's body,

35:21.520 --> 35:24.790
the piece that could confirm
or refute your story,

35:24.823 --> 35:27.759
her left thigh,
is the part that's missing.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.795
- Well, you're not suggesting
I can control the vagaries

35:29.828 --> 35:31.730
of the tides, are you?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.833
It is my most fervent wish
that Susie's limb be found,

35:34.866 --> 35:36.802
because it would prove
what I'm saying.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.904
I mean, the angle
of the blade's entry

35:38.937 --> 35:40.972
would show her wound
was self-inflicted.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.241
- Self-inflicted?

35:42.274 --> 35:43.542
Did she dismember herself too?

35:43.575 --> 35:46.645
- No, obviously I did that.

35:46.678 --> 35:49.848
I didn't know of any other way
to get her out of there.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.454
- That was brutal.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.223
- You got some good shots in
towards the end of your cross.

35:57.223 --> 36:00.492
- Did I? Two hours--
every time I lunged, he parried.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.294
The longer he was up there,
the more the jury liked him.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.595
- How is that possible?

36:03.629 --> 36:05.096
- I don't know--
I mean, he's peculiar,

36:05.130 --> 36:06.598
but there's something
interesting about him.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.899
It's weird,
but at the end of our road trip,

36:07.933 --> 36:09.468
I kind of missed the guy.
- You kind of miss--

36:09.501 --> 36:10.736
You missed him?
- Yeah.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.970
- I thought you two
talked too much.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.505
- Yeah, he does talk.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.140
I mean,
he went into the bathroom.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.842
He was alone in the stall.
He thought nobody was listening,

36:16.875 --> 36:18.510
and he kept
the conversation going alone.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.978
- You know what? He talks
during his autopsies too.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.247
He records everything.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.548
I don't know--
we might go through them,

36:22.581 --> 36:24.783
see if he let something slip.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.452
They're city property,
public records.

36:26.485 --> 36:30.356
- It's worth a shot.
Make a night of it, Rollins?

36:30.389 --> 36:35.060
- Caucasian female,
late 20s, red hair.

36:35.093 --> 36:38.630
Like so many redheads,
less susceptible to anesthesia.

36:40.566 --> 36:44.536
She felt everything
that was being done to her.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.272
- I found out
why he likes redheads.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.839
That's all I got.
- Shh.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.279
I think I got something.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.513
- From an autopsy?

37:09.328 --> 37:09.461
.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.397
- Given the change
in tenor of this conversation,

37:12.631 --> 37:14.966
I'm contacting my lawyer.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.668
I'd like to exercise
that right.

37:16.702 --> 37:17.869
- Feel free.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.572
We will wait to continue
questioning you

37:20.606 --> 37:22.641
until a lawyer arrives.

37:25.143 --> 37:28.814
[footsteps departing,
door closes]

37:28.847 --> 37:31.783
- They can't pin these on you.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.788
Rachel was a crack whore.

37:38.624 --> 37:41.427
And with
the green nail polish

37:41.460 --> 37:44.463
and the proximity
to Yates' victims...

37:46.131 --> 37:48.199
That's far too much
reasonable doubt.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.436
And Lena,

37:50.469 --> 37:53.339
nobody
will buy Yates' word.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.774
And my only risk there
is Susie.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.108
She's dumb as a post,

37:57.142 --> 38:00.346
but she still can put
two and two together.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.548
And if she does...

38:04.383 --> 38:08.354
I suppose
I'll have to kill her...

38:08.387 --> 38:09.988
just like the others.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.061
[sighs]
Kill them all, Carl...

38:18.730 --> 38:21.367
Whatever it takes.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.369
[door opens]

38:23.369 --> 38:25.871
Rita, it's very good of you
to come on such short notice.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.741
- Of course, Carl, but I'm
afraid I have some bad news.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.944
- This is clearly inadmissible,
Your Honor.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.547
- I understand
why you'd like to think that.

38:35.581 --> 38:39.050
Walk me through the provenance
and chain of evidence.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.886
How did this fall
into your hands?

38:40.919 --> 38:42.721
- We asked Dr. Rudnick
to come in for an interview,

38:42.754 --> 38:44.656
and he gave us permission
to record it.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.592
- Your Honor, Dr. Rudnick
had asked for counsel.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.059
- And when he did,
we immediately stopped

38:48.093 --> 38:49.294
questioning him
and left the room.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.396
- Yes, but you
left the camera on.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.798
- He knew that he was
being recorded.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.232
We weren't interrogating him.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.402
This was
a spontaneous admission.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.603
Your client talks to himself.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.238
- Not only is this inadmissible
under Miranda,

39:00.271 --> 39:02.040
but it's also Brady material

39:02.073 --> 39:03.675
that should have been
made available to us.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.976
- It was.
A copy of this video

39:05.010 --> 39:07.145
has been in your possession
since day one.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.080
You must have stopped watching
when we stopped questioning.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.181
- He's right, Mr. Buchanan.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.150
If you turned this off,
it's on you.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.419
This is admissible.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.086
- I was simply thinking
out loud.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.187
- Carl.

39:16.221 --> 39:19.257
- We'll let the jury
determine that.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.927
- You had the recording
for the entirety of my ordeal,

39:21.960 --> 39:25.597
and you didn't know it?
- Carl.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.599
- Your Honor, I immediately move
for new counsel

39:27.633 --> 39:29.701
on the basis
of incompetent defense.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.102
- [chuckles]
That's your right.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.604
I should caution you,
though--

39:32.638 --> 39:35.641
this material is admissible
no matter who defends you.

39:41.980 --> 39:46.117
Dr. Rudnick, I understand
you'd like to change your plea.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.786
- Yes, Your Honor.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.790
- On the charge of murder in
the first degree of Susie Frain,

39:51.823 --> 39:53.091
how do you plead?

39:53.124 --> 39:55.293
- Guilty as charged.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.695
[audience murmuring]

39:56.728 --> 39:57.963
- And to the outstanding charge

39:57.996 --> 40:02.468
of murder in the first degree
of Rachel Groves?

40:02.501 --> 40:05.070
- I'm afraid
I'm guilty on that one as well.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.806
- Your Honor, at this time,

40:07.839 --> 40:10.141
the prosecution would like
to withdraw its charge

40:10.175 --> 40:12.478
of murder in the first degree
of Lena Grunwald.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.480
- All right, Counselors,
thank you for your time.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.081
And now that justice
has been served,

40:16.114 --> 40:17.783
I declare
this court adjourned.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.085
[gavel bangs]

40:24.189 --> 40:27.593
- Wait. He gets away
with Lena's murder.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.094
- Well, he'll still do
25 to life

40:29.127 --> 40:30.762
for the other two charges.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.064
Maybe you two will be
roommates one day.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.600
[chuckles]

40:34.633 --> 40:36.935
- He did it, you know.

40:36.968 --> 40:40.371
Lena--he strangled her
to death.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.675
- Her skull
was also fractured.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.113
- Strangulation
was the cause of death.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.381
Skull fracture
was post-mortem.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.786
- You sound pretty sure
about that.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.455
- I'm just
piecing it together,

40:57.489 --> 40:59.791
but if I had to guess...

40:59.825 --> 41:02.293
Lena was his first time.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.530
Carl screwed up,

41:04.563 --> 41:06.865
and he had to call someone
with more experience

41:06.898 --> 41:10.268
to help him finish.

41:11.737 --> 41:14.673
- And how did
this person help?

41:14.706 --> 41:16.975
- He probably advised Carl

41:17.008 --> 41:19.978
to keep Lena alive

41:20.011 --> 41:22.548
as long as possible.

41:22.548 --> 41:26.852
Such a waste
to have her die so quickly.

41:35.861 --> 41:40.031
- Why are you telling
me this now?

41:40.065 --> 41:43.835
- Because I believe
when one life ends,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.436
another begins.

41:45.470 --> 41:48.574
You are bringing life
into this world

41:48.574 --> 41:52.043
just as I lost my wife
and my child.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.647
I feel a connection to you.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.851
You'll be back.

41:59.885 --> 42:03.454
And I will be here.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.699
[wolf howls]
