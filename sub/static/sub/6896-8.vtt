WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:10.677
Vaux, you're picking up our
fighter parts in the market.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.720
The crates are labeled "Ronto Meat."

00:12.805 --> 00:14.681
And watch out for Imperial troops.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.349
They've increased patrols.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.517
Good luck.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.519
You said you had another mission.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.687
What do you want me to do?

00:20.771 --> 00:22.438
Actually, this one's for her.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.692
Hey!

00:26.026 --> 00:28.528
There's a courier coming in
who has secret information.

00:28.612 --> 00:32.448
I need you to pick him up
and transport him to Havok outpost.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.741
Sounds easy enough.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.743
lf it was easy, I'd send someone else.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.578
This information is important.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.372
We have to get it through.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.124
Keep a low profile.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.543
Don't worry. You can trust me.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.711
What's this courier look like?

00:45.254 --> 00:48.673
I don't know,
but they'll respond to this code phrase.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.174
Got it.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.762
Hey, I can be low profile, too.

00:54.847 --> 00:58.516
You can be backup,
along with Chopper,

00:58.600 --> 00:59.976
but she is in charge.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.352
Understood.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.813
Leader?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.149
Always figured you for a loner.

01:06.817 --> 01:07.942
Not always.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.696
You sure make it seem that way.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.283
You spend a lot of time
in your room, alone.

01:15.367 --> 01:19.162
And you actually
tend to eat alone. Sometimes.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.913
And combat practice alone.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.915
And go off probably to be alone.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.210
And I don't know. I guess sometimes,
you know, I'll find you alone...

01:26.295 --> 01:28.337
After I've, maybe, followed you,

01:28.422 --> 01:31.549
and you're angry
and I've heard you say more than once,

01:31.633 --> 01:32.967
"I want to be alone."

01:33.051 --> 01:36.471
But actually,
I've heard you say quite often,

01:36.555 --> 01:38.765
just straight, "Leave me alone."

01:44.271 --> 01:46.272
Okay. What is that?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.565
Nothing.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.947
Garel Shuttle 3765 from Coruscant

01:55.032 --> 01:57.366
has arrived in Bay 22.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.495
So how do we find this courier?

02:00.579 --> 02:04.123
The code phrase is,
"It's a long way to Alderaan."

02:04.541 --> 02:06.083
I think it's this guy.

02:06.168 --> 02:09.837
Hey. It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.047
Okay.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.133
It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.888
It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.141
It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.061
It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.149
Hangar 22 is now closed.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.700
It's gonna be a long way back
to the Ghost if we miss the courier.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.454
We couldn't have. Hera had
confirmation he boarded the shuttle.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.665
Are you sure you were saying
the code phrase right?

02:45.749 --> 02:49.544
Yes, yes. It's a long way to Alderaan.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.632
What's the matter with this thing?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.009
Wait a minute. That is the courier.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.471
Talk about a low profile.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.348
He came in with the cargo payload.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.268
He's unit EG-86.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.270
Nice to meet you, EG.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.857
I don't get why they'd hide
such important information

03:10.941 --> 03:12.567
in this binary box brain.

03:12.651 --> 03:16.112
Well, would you suspect that thing
of being a spy full of secrets?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.364
No. I guess not.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.949
That's too bad.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.787
Because I would.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.665
Ketsu Onyo.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.924
I saw your mark, old friend.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.134
Friend?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.928
That's a generous term
considering what happened.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.722
You two know each other?

03:42.806 --> 03:44.390
Still a bounty hunter, I see.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.058
Tell me you don't miss it.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.019
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.521
You were a bounty hunter?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.273
That explains a lot.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.609
I don't think Ketsu's here for a reunion.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.985
You know me well.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.320
I'm just here for the droid.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.823
Not you, Chop. Him.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.244
So, Sabine, how do you know her?

04:05.329 --> 04:08.164
She never told you how we broke
out of the Imperial Academy?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.665
That was a long time ago.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.209
Before you got greedy
and left me for dead.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.504
You'd have been better off dead

04:15.589 --> 04:17.423
than joining this band of rebels.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.509
I didn't believe it until I saw
the Empire put a bounty on you.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.345
You gonna try to collect on it?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.221
Haven't decided yet.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.599
Besides, I work for the Black Sun now,

04:26.683 --> 04:29.268
and I have another job to finish first.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.853
I can't let you do that.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.113
How 'bout we all relax before...

04:41.198 --> 04:42.406
You there.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.783
That happens.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.409
Citizens, what's going on here?

04:45.494 --> 04:46.827
There's a curfew on this hangar.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.454
You need to leave immediately.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.164
Don't interrupt us!

04:57.923 --> 05:00.383
Nice shot. Haven't lost your touch.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.970
Good thing you haven't either.

05:04.513 --> 05:05.680
Stay here!

05:11.269 --> 05:12.478
Okay, change of plans, Chop.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.563
Get Boxy here onto that shuttle.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.288
Sabine! Go!

05:38.255 --> 05:41.507
I'm sorry, but there are no more flights
scheduled for this evening.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.093
-lf you contact...
-Yeah, I don't have time to book a ticket.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.595
Chopper, shut him down and take over.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.390
That is unacceptable.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.393
This is my ship, and I will
not take "no" for an...

06:01.403 --> 06:03.154
Bet you're glad you brought backup.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.530
Yeah, it's working out great.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.866
Exactly as planned. Now, hang on!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.756
Hera, the mission's gotten complicated.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.300
I thought you were
keeping a low profile.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.385
Yeah, well, it just went high profile.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.640
There's no escape.
We have you surrounded.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.480
Hello, boys.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.483
I'm afraid this has all been
a terrible misunderstanding.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.318
One that you're gonna answer for.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.111
Now drop your weapons.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.155
-Don't do it.
-Do what?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.490
This?

06:48.950 --> 06:49.950
What the...

06:52.245 --> 06:53.245
Hey!

07:06.593 --> 07:08.385
No, no... No, no, no!

07:14.976 --> 07:17.186
-Where did she go?
-I don't know.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.818
Bounty hunting scum.
Garel's crawling with them.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.451
I'm sure Ezra's fine.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.869
Now, program the hyperdrive.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.663
We need to get to those
rendezvous coordinates.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.001
We got lucky to get away so easily.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.507
Scanning a ship? No.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.646
Yep, that's Ketsu, all right.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.148
She knocked out our hyperdrive,

08:02.232 --> 08:03.983
which means I bet
I know her next move.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.276
Lock yourselves down.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.417
Too late!

08:31.887 --> 08:32.928
Chopper!

08:42.647 --> 08:44.940
Hang on! I gotta seal the hatch.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.647
Next time I steal a ship,
it'll be one with guns.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.405
No hard feelings, Sabine.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.658
It's not personal, just business.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.494
And speaking of business,
here's the deal.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.372
Toss out the power droid,
and I'll let you live.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.249
And if I refuse?

09:43.708 --> 09:47.544
I'll blow up the shuttle
and scoop my bounty from the debris.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.636
I don't believe it.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.346
You better believe it.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.099
I'll do whatever it takes
to complete my mission.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.353
No, I... I don't believe you can do it.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.898
Maybe that's true,
but I've changed more than you realize.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.984
I have new loyalties now.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.534
Right. Finally part of Black Sun.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.786
Just like we always dreamed.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.705
I got the best weapons, best ship,

10:22.789 --> 10:24.832
and I'm feared across the galaxy.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.792
I can't believe I wanted that.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.586
The Black Sun are slavers
and assassins

10:29.671 --> 10:32.798
who don't care about anything
but body counts and quotas.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.508
They'd kill you too, for a profit.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.844
Speaking of which, your time is up.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.887
Now hand over the droid.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.729
You can't do it.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.857
I really wish
it hadn't come to this, old friend.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.987
What?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.033
You?

10:59.117 --> 11:01.702
That's my weapons array!
What have you done?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.871
So long, old friend.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.477
I'll hold her steady. Just get him inside.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.317
No, you don't.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.713
Where's Chopper?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.091
Calm down. What are you saying?

12:08.186 --> 12:10.813
All right, Ketsu. Let's make a trade.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.233
I'll extend the docking ramp
and get your little friend ready.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.866
I had a feeling she wouldn't leave you.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.243
She was always soft.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.629
Try anything, and I'll disintegrate you.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.345
Stay here.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.395
Well, well. While I've changed,

12:51.479 --> 12:53.480
it seems you haven't changed at all.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.486
You're not giving up
the courier, are you?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.155
Nope. You're gonna have to take him.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.781
And this astromech.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.159
Not very smart,
sticking your neck out for it.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.660
Chopper's more than a droid.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.620
He's a rebel and a friend.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.957
Sabine.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.672
We were once friends.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.716
Tell you what. Give me the power droid,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.926
and I'll share my cut with you.
Like the old days.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.637
I don't do things
just for money anymore.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.433
That's right. Now there's "the cause."

13:29.893 --> 13:33.312
You really think your little rebel group
can overthrow the Empire?

13:33.396 --> 13:36.773
Grow up, little sister.
You can't be that foolish.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.694
Once we were like sisters.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.405
But we only cared about ourselves.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.491
It's called survival.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.619
You, of all people,
should know you can't trust anyone.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.370
I forgive you.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.663
For what?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.165
For leaving me for dead.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917
And I still trust you.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.460
And you're wrong.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.379
I met people who gave me
a second chance in life,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.256
and that's what I'm giving you.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.846
Imperial cruiser to Garel shuttle 63725.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.307
Your craft has been
identified as stolen.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.100
Prepare to be boarded.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.521
Looks like we're friends again.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.606
Don't have much of a choice.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.368
Hold position for docking.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.412
Attempt to flee,
and you will be fired upon.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.919
Thanks to your little rust bucket,
I've got no firepower.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.671
And as long
as we're docked to this shuttle,

14:40.755 --> 14:43.715
we can't use the Shadow Caster's
hyperdrive to escape.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.969
Chop, overload the hyperdrive
on the shuttle.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.473
What are you doing?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.476
Buying us time.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.689
Attention, Imperial vessel.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.735
Please be aware, our ships have
suffered extensive damage

15:03.820 --> 15:06.071
and are in danger of self-destruction.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.406
I am scanning.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.157
System failures in both ships

15:09.242 --> 15:12.160
and a hyperdrive
coolant leak in the shuttle.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.913
Shuttle craft, you have
two minutes to stabilize.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.999
Then we will be coming aboard.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.251
What can you do in two minutes?

15:20.128 --> 15:21.253
Watch.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.213
Chopper, purge the reactor,

15:23.298 --> 15:24.923
then get over to the Shadow Caster

15:25.008 --> 15:27.801
and prepare to disengage
the docking tube on my signal.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.888
You're going to blow up the shuttle?

15:31.973 --> 15:34.725
Which will get us
the time we need to make our escape.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.103
I should have known. You always
liked to make things go boom.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.771
Something I learned from you.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.107
Still got the armory of
explosives you used to carry?

15:42.191 --> 15:43.358
On my ship.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.778
Only friends I've ever needed.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.447
Until today.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.575
I'll plant them on the shuttle
to give the reactor an extra kick.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.201
That's the Sabine I remember.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.037
Now you get sentimental.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.289
Just get the Shadow Caster
ready to fly.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.299
Sir, I'm registering
a power surge on the shuttle.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.051
Imperial cruiser to shuttle.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.553
We are reading a power surge
on your vessel.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.472
Your reactor core is unstable.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.265
Contain the problem immediately.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.561
It is looking pretty bad over here.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.313
I'd keep my distance if I were you.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.983
Whichever one of you thieves
is in charge, identify yourself.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.235
You should probably talk to the captain.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.696
Hey, Captain. Wake up!

16:30.031 --> 16:31.907
Not take no for an answer!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.575
Your ship is under attack.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.786
You need to exercise
emergency protocol.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.705
-Under attack?
-See that Imperial cruiser out there?

16:38.790 --> 16:41.541
It's getting ready to destroy
your shuttle for being stolen.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.918
Destroy my ship?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.754
Time to go.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.173
Sir, the shuttle's thrusters
are powering up.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.258
Target the control hub. Disable it.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.391
I think they're onto us.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.977
Droid, release the docking tube,
or we're all gonna die.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.822
We have sustained severe damage.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.949
Engaging emergency protocols.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.951
Full power to the thrusters!

17:25.044 --> 17:27.963
Warning! I have engaged
emergency protocols.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.632
Good for you!

17:32.969 --> 17:34.803
Detecting a reactor malfunction.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.472
How did that happen? Where am I?

17:42.478 --> 17:45.313
This shuttle captain is bold, but foolish.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.108
Activate tractor beam.
Take hold of that ship.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.779
Happy now, droid? Get us outta here!

18:02.665 --> 18:05.000
Sir, the other ship
is powering up rapidly.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.585
Their hyperdrive is online.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.170
Lock onto both ships.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.429
It's too late. They've got us.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.805
Not for long.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.935
Are those explosives?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.691
Reactor breach!

18:40.286 --> 18:41.453
Status report!

18:41.537 --> 18:44.372
Sir, the shuttle exploded
and broke our lock.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.124
We've suffered significant damage,

18:46.209 --> 18:48.960
and the second ship is gone.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.988
You can report to Senator Organa

19:17.073 --> 19:19.908
that his intel
has arrived safe and sound.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.422
Let's get you home.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.189
So this is really happening?

19:51.274 --> 19:54.317
Last I saw these two,
they were gonna shoot each other.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.528
lf I'm not mistaken,
when we first met you,

19:56.612 --> 19:58.196
you were stealing from us.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.452
Congratulations on
the successful mission.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.874
Thank you for helping our cause.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.209
Well, it was mostly an accident.

20:11.294 --> 20:15.046
I'm not sure I'm ready for
a full-on fight with the Empire just yet.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.715
No one ever is.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.387
I'm Ezra. We almost
blasted each other earlier.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.889
I know who you are.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.640
Sabine told me all about you.

20:26.142 --> 20:29.644
She did? Well, what... What'd she say?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.813
I mean, it was all good, right?

20:32.690 --> 20:34.691
Ezra, can I get a moment here?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.568
Sure.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.158
You mean, you two.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.035
A moment, right.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.536
I'll just be over there.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.288
You could've left me on that shuttle,

20:48.372 --> 20:50.832
taken the droids
and made a good profit.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.460
It's only money.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.669
Thank you.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.422
It must be nice
to have people backing you up.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.425
I had that once, when we were friends.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.801
Haven't had that since.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.847
Look, if you think you'd want to
help us out, make a difference,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.599
just let us know.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.643
I'll think about it.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.269
That's a start.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.692
Think that's the last we've seen of her?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.199
No, and I'm glad.
