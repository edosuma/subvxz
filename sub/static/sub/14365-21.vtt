<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:03.899 --> 00:07.334
It will only respond
to the power of a Prime!

00:09.938 --> 00:13.239
Our sensors detected
a second Iacon-locator beacon.

00:13.308 --> 00:14.074
I'll go.

00:14.142 --> 00:17.777
<i>Smokescreen chooses a vehicle
mode with screaming double "38s"</i>

00:17.846 --> 00:20.647
<i>on the doors,
making him an easy target.</i>

00:20.716 --> 00:23.516
<i>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more
than concerned about Jack's safety.</i>

00:23.585 --> 00:29.923
The Star Saber, a legendary
weapon forged by Solus Prime.

00:33.795 --> 00:39.766
We Decepticons now
face our darkest hour.

00:39.835 --> 00:42.168
I am receiving a message.

00:42.237 --> 00:45.438
- From who?
- Alpha Trion.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.463
<b>2x21 - Alpha, Omega</b>

00:48.876 --> 00:50.544
<i>Forgive me, lord Megatron.</i>

00:50.545 --> 00:54.131
<i>While I do not question
the wisdom of our tactical retreat,</i>

00:54.132 --> 00:55.982
know that I am fully prepared to

00:56.051 --> 01:00.186
lead the troops in a counterattack
against the Autobots.

01:00.255 --> 01:03.623
Counterattack? Perhaps
you failed to notice

01:03.692 --> 01:07.727
Optimus Prime cleave an entire
mountain with a single blow.

01:07.796 --> 01:11.364
With the Star Saber in his
possession, my enemy can

01:11.433 --> 01:14.434
obliterate us all with
a wave of his hand!

01:14.503 --> 01:19.072
I must find a way to tip the
balance of power back in our favor.

01:19.141 --> 01:23.777
Do we not also possess a
powerful relic of the ancients

01:23.845 --> 01:27.814
Indeed ...
the forge of Solus Prime.

01:27.883 --> 01:33.520
But it is useless, except
in the hand of a Prime.

01:38.126 --> 01:45.031
But I might wield that power if
I were to control such a hand!

01:45.100 --> 01:51.104
Optimus, what is Alpha Trion saying?

01:51.173 --> 01:56.360
<i>I wish that I could meet you under
better circumstances, Optimus Prime,</i>

01:56.361 --> 02:01.548
<i>but I fear that Iacon will not
withstand the next Decepticon assault.</i>

02:01.616 --> 02:06.252
So you speak to me
from across the ages.

02:06.321 --> 02:11.056
<i>If you are listening to this message,
then I take solace that</i>

02:11.126 --> 02:14.561
<i>you now possess the Star Saber.</i>

02:14.629 --> 02:18.832
<i>I am certain that you have
deduced how these Cybertronian</i>

02:18.900 --> 02:24.437
<i>relics and Decepticon weapons came
to be found on such a remote world.</i>

02:24.506 --> 02:28.975
<i>Indeed, I transported them
there, not so much to keep them</i>

02:29.044 --> 02:35.215
<i>far from Megatron's hands, but
to ensure that they reach yours.</i>

04:26.508 --> 04:30.777
Easy, Optimus.

04:30.845 --> 04:35.081
- So, did Alpha try and ask about me?
- What was the message?

04:35.150 --> 04:40.128
It is paramount that we recover
the final four Iacon relics ...

04:40.129 --> 04:41.788
the Omega keys.

04:41.856 --> 04:43.956
- Keys?
- To what?

04:44.025 --> 04:48.094
To the regeneration
of our home planet.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.437
<i>Earth's Moon is
a barren rock, is it not?</i>

04:57.505 --> 05:02.442
Indeed, Dreadwing. But the
Moon is not our destination.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.915
<i>A space bridge?</i>

05:08.983 --> 05:13.719
<i>Our very own, relocated here
after the Autobots discovered</i>

05:13.788 --> 05:15.655
<i>its whereabouts on Earth.</i>

05:15.856 --> 05:19.258
The dark side of the Moon is
hidden from prying human eyes

05:19.327 --> 05:24.664
and, more importantly,
well out of the Autobots' reach.

05:24.732 --> 05:26.303
Come, Dreadwing!

05:27.942 --> 05:29.819
We shall travel to the
one place in the galaxy

05:29.820 --> 05:34.907
which may provide us with a
means of defeating Optimus Prime.

05:43.150 --> 05:47.053
Pack your gear.
We're going back to Cybertron!

05:50.925 --> 05:55.294
Well, believe it now,
Bumblebee. Civilization at last.

05:55.363 --> 05:58.331
- But I just got here.
- Remember oil baths?

05:58.399 --> 06:02.401
The first thing I'm gonna do planetside
is soak for an entire solar cycle.

06:03.538 --> 06:09.575
- I can't wait to tell Miko.
- And Jack.

06:12.947 --> 06:16.682
Uh... Optimus, keys open doors.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.152
Can they really revive an entire planet?

06:19.220 --> 06:23.356
While I am unfamiliar with
the lore of these Omega keys,

06:23.424 --> 06:27.960
Alpha Trion knew many secrets,
and the ancients possessed

06:28.029 --> 06:32.999
technology that has long been lost
to what we consider modern science.

06:40.807 --> 06:45.745
<i>The devastation to our home
world is worse than I remember.</i>

06:45.813 --> 06:49.849
<i>Curse the Autobots to the pit!</i>

06:50.751 --> 06:53.920
Whatever their function,
this much is certain ...

06:53.921 --> 06:59.492
we cannot restore Cybertron without
all four Omega keys in our possession.

06:59.561 --> 07:02.795
Which means we can't afford
to lose a single one to Megatron.

07:02.864 --> 07:06.666
Four sets of coordinates from
Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

07:06.734 --> 07:10.570
It is logical to conclude that
each corresponds to the location

07:10.638 --> 07:16.275
of one of the Omega keys. I must
not waver until I decode them all.

07:16.344 --> 07:20.413
The future of our home
world depends on it.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.453
<i>A tomb.</i>

07:27.522 --> 07:31.424
One known to contain
the remains of Primes.

07:31.492 --> 07:35.428
Please tell me you're
not averse to desecration.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.965
It is just that being in
such a place evokes powerful

07:39.033 --> 07:42.535
emotions, considering
the fate of my twin.

07:42.604 --> 07:46.372
Then you should delight in
our purpose here, to exact our

07:46.441 --> 07:51.711
revenge of Skyquake and
of all our fallen brethren.

08:10.030 --> 08:16.035
You shall require a more practical
means of carrying such a blade.

08:16.104 --> 08:19.672
I feel funny saying this, but
I'm not sure I want to go back.

08:19.741 --> 08:23.643
Who knew we'd ever get
so used to our new home?

08:25.613 --> 08:28.614
Yeah. I don't think I'd
ever want to leave Miko.

08:28.683 --> 08:31.250
We've made friends here, family.

08:31.319 --> 08:35.587
<i>We could always... text them.</i>

08:35.657 --> 08:39.625
Besides, been fighting for so long,
I don't know if I can do anything else.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.094
You can go back into construction.

08:42.163 --> 08:46.385
The power of the ancients may breathe
life back into Cybertron's core,

08:46.386 --> 08:50.169
but our war-ravaged cities
will surely require rebuilding.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.538
I wouldn't make any
travel plans just yet.

08:52.607 --> 08:56.475
We still have to locate these Omega
keys and secure them before the 'Cons do.

08:56.544 --> 08:58.377
Yeah, like that'll be a problem.

08:58.446 --> 09:02.848
Optimus has the Star Saber now.
Megatron's end is in sight.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.759
<i>Yes, I can do it, lord Megatron,</i>

09:05.760 --> 09:10.022
if you're certain that's
what you really want.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.526
Like nothing I've ever
desired before, Doctor.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.262
- I shall induce stasis.
- No!

09:16.331 --> 09:22.702
I wish to bear witness as
you attach my new appendage.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.637
Coming up.

09:36.951 --> 09:41.620
Autobots, I have decoded the first
set of the final four coordinates.

09:41.689 --> 09:45.324
Divide into teams in the event
that I'm able to decode another

09:45.393 --> 09:47.126
before the first team returns.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.362
I'm on team one.
Who's with me?

09:49.430 --> 09:52.598
I'll go.

09:52.667 --> 09:56.313
After you, sir ...
ma'am ...

09:57.746 --> 09:58.671
...commander?

09:58.740 --> 10:00.606
This should be interesting.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.184
Yes.

10:19.926 --> 10:26.132
At long last, the power of
the Primes belongs to me!

10:43.199 --> 10:45.067
First one is here.

10:45.169 --> 10:49.872
No locator beacon, which means the
relic's still buried right about...

10:51.108 --> 10:52.975
...there.

11:02.919 --> 11:07.222
The forge of Solus Prime
possesses the ability to create

11:07.291 --> 11:09.325
anything from raw material.

11:09.393 --> 11:15.397
And in this case, said raw material
would be a big hunk of Dark Energon.

11:26.510 --> 11:29.495
Uh, Arcee, I-I owe you an apology.

11:29.496 --> 11:32.481
I never meant to endanger Jack.

11:32.550 --> 11:36.318
Humans squish easily.
I get that now.

11:36.387 --> 11:42.825
This isn't just about Jack. Team Prime
can't afford any casualties, human or bot.

11:42.893 --> 11:44.760
I've already lost two seasoned partners.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.562
I don't need a rookie on my scorecard.

11:47.999 --> 11:52.401
Not gonna happen.
Elite guardsman's honor.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.336
Wait. You lost two partners?

12:06.249 --> 12:09.685
You have decoded the next
set of Iacon coordinates.

12:09.754 --> 12:12.354
Excellent work, Soundwave.

12:16.560 --> 12:22.464
Ha. Nice of the humans to pile all
these rocks on top of our relic, huh?

12:36.580 --> 12:40.215
Pretty much spells
things out, doesn't it?

12:40.284 --> 12:42.418
Come on.
Help me move this.

12:52.128 --> 12:55.631
The ancient humans must have thought
the Omega key was a gift from the gods.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.267
And, in a sense, they weren't wrong.

13:04.641 --> 13:08.243
The relic... now!

13:08.312 --> 13:11.180
Two against one.
We can take him.

13:17.487 --> 13:20.856
Ratchet, ground bridge, now!

14:02.365 --> 14:04.233
Smokescreen!

14:12.842 --> 14:17.546
What manner of treasure
did Iacon send us this time?

14:17.615 --> 14:21.350
I would slice you in two right now...

14:21.418 --> 14:23.919
but I need you to deliver a message.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.923
Tell Optimus Prime that
if he wants this relic,

14:26.924 --> 14:29.858
he must come and claim it himself!

14:36.916 --> 14:39.918
<i>And then Smokescreen
was just... gone... </i>

14:39.987 --> 14:42.988
like he turned to dust.

14:43.657 --> 14:45.157
Poor kid.

14:45.225 --> 14:49.795
Arcee, do not blame yourself. It
could just as easily have been you.

14:51.332 --> 14:55.100
I say we go claim a piece of
Megatron's miserable, metal hide!

14:56.003 --> 15:00.639
No. We have already lost
another one of our own today.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.308
I will not risk more lives.

15:03.377 --> 15:07.980
Given what Arcee witnessed,
it stands to reason that Megatron

15:08.048 --> 15:12.751
now possesses might to equal
the Star Saber, which means only

15:12.820 --> 15:16.121
I have a chance of
recovering the Omega key.

15:16.190 --> 15:19.758
The fate of Cybertron
rests upon its retrieval.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.627
Whether Megatron knows it or not.

15:38.611 --> 15:44.049
Claim your prize,
Optimus, if you can.

15:48.588 --> 15:53.225
By the Allspark, Megatron,
what have you done?!

15:53.293 --> 15:57.029
This. I find it affords me certain

15:57.097 --> 16:04.671
advantages, such as the use
of the Forge of Solus Prime.

16:06.740 --> 16:11.576
My first creation, fashioned
from the very blood of Unicron.

16:11.645 --> 16:18.250
I call it the Dark Star Saber ...
slayer of Primes, if you will.

17:08.769 --> 17:13.038
At last we take our rightful
places, Optimus, as gods,

17:13.107 --> 17:19.478
wielding the power of the cosmos!

17:19.546 --> 17:22.380
I am but a soldier, Megatron,

17:22.449 --> 17:27.452
and you are a prisoner of
your own twisted delusions!

17:53.113 --> 17:56.314
My Dark Star Saber has
tasted one spark tonight.

17:56.383 --> 18:00.252
It still thirsts for that of a Prime!

18:28.514 --> 18:32.184
And so it ends, just as I envisioned,

18:32.185 --> 18:35.854
with your head beside my new trophy.

18:35.923 --> 18:38.690
<i>Oh, you mean this?</i>

18:38.759 --> 18:43.962
Finders keepers.

18:44.031 --> 18:48.133
You!

18:48.202 --> 18:50.068
Smokescreen, fall back!

19:11.791 --> 19:13.692
Ratchet, ground bridge!

19:13.760 --> 19:15.493
No!

19:15.562 --> 19:19.064
Missed us.

19:39.152 --> 19:42.120
Run, Optimus, run!

19:42.189 --> 19:45.440
Those trinkets from
Iacon will not save you,

19:45.441 --> 19:52.430
not when I now possess the
power to tear this world apart!

20:02.808 --> 20:07.746
- Smokescreen?!
- And Omega key number one.

20:07.814 --> 20:11.816
But... how?
I mean, I saw you.

20:11.885 --> 20:15.720
I, uh, decided to
borrow the Phase shifter.

20:17.457 --> 20:19.591
- Again?
- Good thing, too.

20:19.660 --> 20:25.363
The wave from the blast
hit me like a wrecking ball.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.736
<i>The impact must have
activated the shifter.</i>

20:31.805 --> 20:35.040
<i>I don't know how long I was
unconscious, but when I made my</i>

20:35.108 --> 20:43.114
<i>way back outside, Optimus and Megatron
were deep in an epic throwdown.</i>

20:43.183 --> 20:45.850
I waited for the right
moment to make my move.

20:45.919 --> 20:47.852
You're learning.

20:47.921 --> 20:51.589
So, can I keep it? I mean,
it is really working out for me.

20:51.658 --> 20:53.291
Fine, fine.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.895
Yes!
Signature weapon!

21:04.337 --> 21:08.773
You got yours.
Optimus lost his.

21:08.842 --> 21:11.776
The balance of power shifted again.

21:11.845 --> 21:14.979
While he may have wielded the
power of the ancients for only

21:15.048 --> 21:21.553
one day, Optimus does not require
it to be the mightiest of warriors.
