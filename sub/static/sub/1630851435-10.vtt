WEBVTT

01:42.977 --> 01:46.189
Zero Block. This is A-Block. Over.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.360
This is Zero Block. A-Block. Over.

01:50.944 --> 01:55.365
I now have visual confirmation
of Baki Hanma. Over.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.035
Roger. Report in detail. Over.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.164
Currently, the shooting squad
has apprehended Baki Hanma.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.042
It looks like the warden
is lecturing him. Over.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.878
That'll likely be a long lecture.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.590
Be patient and keep monitoring
the situation. Over.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.842
Roger that.

02:14.342 --> 02:17.220
Will patiently keep monitoring. Over.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.639
Good luck. Over and out.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.143
You're acting pretty tough.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.146
Even in this dismal situation,

02:26.229 --> 02:31.985
you claim you can be like Unchained,
unbound by anyone.

02:35.655 --> 02:40.743
Would I be correct to assume that
you believe you can escape this situation?

02:42.287 --> 02:43.163
Of course.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.748
How exciting.

02:49.752 --> 02:53.089
The shooting squad has now
surrounded Baki Hanma. Over.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.675
How kind of them. Over.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.678
Even now?

02:59.846 --> 03:00.680
Yeah.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.024
I would love to hear
what leads you to believe that.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.444
Then, could you please show me
how you'd escape?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.696
I'm already doing it.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.281
Oh-ho!

03:22.243 --> 03:23.203
Huh?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.206
I broke them earlier.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.458
When?

03:28.541 --> 03:31.336
When you entered my space.

03:32.128 --> 03:32.962
With this.

03:36.674 --> 03:37.967
Impossible.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.720
And, it wasn't just you.

03:45.767 --> 03:50.230
The six shooters here.
I've taken each of their second buttons.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.231
What?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.235
In other words, here.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.989
I took the buttons
from the weakest point on the torso.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
It's taking forever.

04:09.999 --> 04:14.754
Your plan ended in failure,
the moment you surrounded me.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.466
Your arrogance, bolstered by your guns,

04:19.217 --> 04:21.886
led you to enter too close into my space.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.764
Even now,

04:25.473 --> 04:28.977
if someone here pulls their trigger,

04:29.978 --> 04:35.024
and they don't precisely hit my cerebellum
which controls my motor nerves,

04:35.108 --> 04:37.151
I will definitely make a move.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.656
Of course, in that case,
I'll be taking much more than buttons.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.535
Maybe I'll crush the groin with a kick,

04:46.077 --> 04:47.537
or gouge the throat,

04:48.830 --> 04:50.665
or pierce the philtrum.

04:51.791 --> 04:56.254
In any case, at least two
out of the six will certainly die.

04:57.630 --> 05:02.677
Plus, not one of them here knows
the location of the cerebellum.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.265
What are you thinking?

05:07.974 --> 05:11.102
A shot in the head or the heart
and you'll die on the spot.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.437
It's common sense.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.818
It's time to stop listening
to this child's nonsense.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.322
Shoot him in the knee
and teach him a lesson.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.455
They can't do it.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.458
Too bad, Warden.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.794
They understand.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.341
They understand the fact
that they're actually the hostages.

05:43.051 --> 05:47.597
Warden, I hate to be a bother, but would
you put your arm around my shoulders?

05:48.681 --> 05:51.434
So that it comes across
as friendly to anyone watching.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.603
Like you would to your best friend.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.356
Now!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.610
A sight, the first in history,

06:00.693 --> 06:04.489
of gun-wielding hostages
taken by a barehanded criminal.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.242
Oh my.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.287
Now we see the warden's whimsy.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.831
What's going on, A-Block?

06:13.915 --> 06:14.749
Nothing.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.835
Everyone's going on a friendly picnic.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.753
Picnic?

06:18.836 --> 06:20.671
Oh, I get it.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.508
Nice of the Warden.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.515
Open!

06:38.106 --> 06:41.859
At the whimsical warden's direction,
the remaining two doors…

06:42.860 --> 06:44.654
opened without hesitation.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.412
Baki was clearly Unchained.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.289
Game over.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.463
Inmate Baki Hanma returns.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.799
Put the cuffs on.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.053
Are you insulting us?

07:09.137 --> 07:14.809
I just wanted to see
if I could get out or not.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.811
I see.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.814
So, you've succeeded
in becoming Unchained?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.608
Won't you congratulate me?

07:25.403 --> 07:28.990
Given my position, I can't do that.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.325
Doors opening!

07:48.509 --> 07:49.594
Mister.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.118
Did you abandon your escape?

08:14.202 --> 08:17.622
Less of an escape, more of an… outing?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.626
Like I care!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.336
He's angry!

08:23.419 --> 08:26.631
Oliva never gets upset.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.634
Going on a walk wasn't my goal.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.387
What was your goal, then?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.140
Mr. Oliva.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.143
Does my freedom bother you?

08:40.394 --> 08:44.190
You think you're on my level, kid?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.737
Going outside when I please,
without using weapons.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.572
And, coming back when I'm finished.

08:52.365 --> 08:57.161
How are you and I any different?

08:59.163 --> 09:00.164
Michael.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.000
Take off his cuffs.

09:03.084 --> 09:03.918
Huh?

09:04.001 --> 09:09.423
I was only going to tell you
if he didn't come back from his outing.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.930
In Japan there's the saying:
"to cauterize the skin with moxa."

09:19.725 --> 09:22.728
Resist all you want, kid.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.439
No need to take them off.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.691
Huh?

09:32.029 --> 09:35.700
You just had a flashy fight
with Mr. Guevaru two days ago,

09:35.783 --> 09:38.286
and although you're still a bit beat up,

09:38.369 --> 09:42.206
you think,
"My opponent's a kid. No problem."

09:43.040 --> 09:45.710
You don't know who you're dealing with!

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
I'll let it slide for today.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.258
Grab some food, and try again!

09:54.427 --> 09:57.346
What a thing to say to Mr. Unchained!

09:57.430 --> 10:02.351
"Grab some food, and try again!"

10:13.446 --> 10:15.114
I get it.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.620
You're right.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.081
I haven't eaten breakfast today.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.376
Call it forgetful.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.379
That was some good advice!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.884
Must be tough being an adult.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.639
As the original Mr. Unchained,

10:39.722 --> 10:45.102
responding to the challenges
of a new Unchained

10:45.186 --> 10:47.647
would be beneath your dignity.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.108
So you hold in your flaring anger

10:51.192 --> 10:53.319
to assert your dignity.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.906
That's more or less it, isn't it?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.660
No adult wants to dance
to some brat's tune.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.664
What's wrong, young Baki?

11:05.873 --> 11:11.212
All I said was
that I forgot to eat breakfast.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.174
All this talk of the original
and the new Unchained,

11:15.758 --> 11:18.427
you're not yourself today, little Baki.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.932
It doesn't matter now.

11:23.516 --> 11:29.021
I don't care if you are free or unfree.

11:30.022 --> 11:34.443
I just wanted to show to the old man
who mistakenly thinks

11:34.527 --> 11:36.153
he's the most free in the world…

11:36.779 --> 11:39.949
that if I wanted to,
even I could leave a prison, too.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.995
I don't really feel like I'm not free now.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
I don't even need to go out.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.209
Let's go back in, Warden.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.378
It's just so stupid.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.216
Not feeling free unless
you're the most free person in the world.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.219
How unfree.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.555
Poor thing.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.732
Um, uh… Mister.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.988
I'll just put this in the garage.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.490
Hm?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.993
Uh, the bike.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.997
Yeah, I'll do it.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.998
Uh, okay.

12:36.046 --> 12:36.881
Um…

12:44.764 --> 12:47.016
I was just thinking of trading it in.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.978
Get me a brand new one.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.778
Every day.

12:59.945 --> 13:00.863
Every day.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.284
Whatever happens, every day…

13:07.995 --> 13:09.705
I go to Maria.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.795
I might be called
the strongest man in America,

13:16.295 --> 13:20.049
or the most selfish man in America.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.636
But, this daily duty…

13:25.221 --> 13:30.309
this ritual, is actually my only respite.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.814
Three minutes before the appointed time.

13:36.023 --> 13:40.569
It's been over ten years since we met.

13:41.737 --> 13:46.575
And yet, I'm giddy,
as if it were the first day we met.

13:47.284 --> 13:52.289
Attentive, as if it were the last day
we might ever have together.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.098
There you are!

14:09.723 --> 14:10.850
You're late.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.606
Forgive me, honey.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.985
I was so worried about being on time,

14:21.485 --> 14:24.864
I neglected to consider your feelings.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.366
I was careless.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.034
I'm so sorry!

14:35.457 --> 14:36.625
Hm?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.085
Oh, I see!

14:38.711 --> 14:41.797
You want to beat me
at rock-paper-scissors.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.133
Hurry up.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.887
You know I'm competitive
when it comes to contests.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.141
I'm the strongest in America,
even in rock-paper-scissors.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.809
Just hurry up!

14:54.727 --> 14:58.314
Here it comes!

14:58.397 --> 15:01.400
Rock-paper-scissors!

15:04.236 --> 15:07.615
Ah, darn it! I lost!

15:07.698 --> 15:10.659
I couldn't decide between rock or paper.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.955
Right, this time for sure!

15:15.039 --> 15:18.667
Rock-paper-scissors!

15:19.335 --> 15:21.712
Ah, I lost again!

15:22.379 --> 15:24.423
I should have done paper!

15:24.506 --> 15:25.674
Scissors!

15:25.758 --> 15:29.053
Argh, I did rock!

15:29.136 --> 15:31.639
To lose three in a row!

15:31.722 --> 15:35.935
I thought for sure that paper was coming.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.188
No matter how many times we do it…

15:39.271 --> 15:41.106
I shouldn't have done scissors!

15:41.190 --> 15:43.442
…the winner is whoever we say it is.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.445
It's the most ambiguous game in the world.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.234
Darling?

16:27.486 --> 16:31.490
I couldn't even win once tonight.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.369
But, next time I won't let you win.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.998
The winner is whoever we say it is.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.210
The most gentle game in the world.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.632
Solitary confinement.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.552
Known as the Black Door.

16:52.636 --> 16:55.180
In a sense, it is where the lucky ones,

16:55.723 --> 16:58.225
who were captured instead of shot,
are held.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.645
That being said…

17:02.187 --> 17:04.148
Boss! Boss!

17:04.815 --> 17:05.649
What?

17:05.733 --> 17:08.152
My shoulder! My arm's about to fall off!

17:09.069 --> 17:12.364
Please! Please take off the finger-cuffs!

17:12.448 --> 17:14.408
Please! I won't run away!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.161
Boss! Boss!

17:17.244 --> 17:19.997
Water! Just a cup of water!

17:20.080 --> 17:21.915
How long will this last?

17:22.499 --> 17:23.917
I'll never do it again!

17:44.021 --> 17:46.023
You seem to be doing well.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.941
And you?

17:48.525 --> 17:52.780
Baki. Reality is harsh.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.824
No matter how much
you laugh at my lack of freedom,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.577
or how loudly you profess your comfort,

17:59.119 --> 18:00.454
this is reality.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.457
I'm going to eat now.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.502
A luxurious 100,000-kilocalorie meal.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.880
I have such an appetite.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.757
It must be tough on the cook.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.969
World-class wine as my apéritif.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.807
For dessert, cognac in a musk melon.

18:20.307 --> 18:24.686
For a digestif,
the very best sherry, and a cigar.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.357
After I eat, I may go for a walk.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.777
Or, take a nap on my king-size bed.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.052
You should chew on that.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.763
The difference in our situations.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.391
Arizona State Prison.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.269
This is my kingdom.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.523
Oliva, I can vow this.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.025
In the very near future,

19:13.735 --> 19:15.779
you will grovel before me.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.157
Begging me to fight you.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.410
Begging me to accept your challenge.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.169
Oh man, too funny.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.213
It's such a good time with you.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.675
Hey, think about it.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.678
You, the most elite person here,

19:40.262 --> 19:44.683
just pissed on a person
who can't even move.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.187
That's how different
our situations are right now.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.480
But look at you.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.692
You aren't laughing at all!

19:57.279 --> 20:00.824
Aren't you gonna laugh, Unchained?

20:00.908 --> 20:04.203
Or can't you laugh, Unchained?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.215
Mister, please look at this.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.841
Something I found.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.386
1985 Lomanée-Conte Magnum.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.056
From the very best of years,

20:24.139 --> 20:28.018
this one bottle
is as expensive as a luxury car.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.396
Goodness gracious me!

20:44.993 --> 20:46.370
As expected.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.872
It's good, is it not?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.750
An immaculate Pinot-Noir.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.378
A magnificent fruit flavor.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.672
Cask-aged,

20:57.339 --> 21:00.384
and an earthy scent from a rich soil.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.135
And, the herbs.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.055
A slight nuance of tobacco.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.642
Though I only had but a sip,

21:09.726 --> 21:13.605
it's like a 100-piece orchestra.

21:14.481 --> 21:19.861
Despite a complex blending
of a myriad of flavors,

21:19.945 --> 21:25.867
None of them are too ostentatious,
and each remain distinct.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.787
The perfect balance.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.418
However,

21:34.501 --> 21:38.380
what about this liquid of fermented grapes

21:39.172 --> 21:43.468
makes it worth 10,000 times the cost
an affordable ten-dollar wine?

21:43.552 --> 21:44.678
Um, Mister?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.181
The deliciousness is
at most 11 or 12 times.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.685
The pleasure is at most 14 or 15 times.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.697
Call the Warden.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.701
Sorry, Baki.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.038
I wanted to get you some ice, but…

22:17.252 --> 22:18.962
It's delicious.

23:46.716 --> 23:51.179
