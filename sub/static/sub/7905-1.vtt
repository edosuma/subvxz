03:09.182 --> 03:13.016
You couldn't hide, Johnny!
Nobody hides from us!

03:18.024 --> 03:19.013
Shit!

03:19.192 --> 03:21.752
Get me ice. I broke my goddamn hand.

03:21.928 --> 03:23.259
Sure, boss.

03:40.914 --> 03:42.245
Fuck you!

03:42.415 --> 03:43.575
Just do me!

03:43.850 --> 03:45.750
Sure, Johnny. But first...

03:45.919 --> 03:48.012
...Mr. Canelli wants a little souvenir.

03:51.524 --> 03:52.513
Open up!

03:52.692 --> 03:53.852
Open up!

03:54.027 --> 03:57.019
We'll send this to your
Witness Protection buddies.

03:57.197 --> 03:59.256
See if it sings on its own.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.864
They can take it to the trial.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.195
Open up!

04:08.775 --> 04:09.537
Benny?

04:27.293 --> 04:28.624
Who the hell are you?

04:36.736 --> 04:37.464
Close your eyes.

04:37.637 --> 04:38.228
Who are you?!

04:38.404 --> 04:38.995
Shut up!

04:45.078 --> 04:45.806
You too!

04:45.979 --> 04:46.809
It's okay.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.913
Do what he says.

04:50.316 --> 04:52.409
Don't move. You're dead.

04:57.323 --> 04:59.416
I need the clothes you're wearing.

04:59.592 --> 05:00.820
Your ring.

05:00.994 --> 05:02.154
Your watch.

05:02.595 --> 05:03.994
All your IDs.

05:04.264 --> 05:05.322
Now.

05:05.598 --> 05:06.656
Do it!

05:10.670 --> 05:12.103
Come with me.

05:18.845 --> 05:20.335
Grab the other one.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.112
Let's go.

05:39.532 --> 05:42.126
Put your clothes on them. Move!

06:07.727 --> 06:10.218
There's been a murder
at 232 Alden Drive.

06:10.563 --> 06:11.996
Send the police.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.334
They killed you, then
turned on each other.

06:18.338 --> 06:19.828
Right.

06:20.573 --> 06:22.564
You sons-of-bitches.

06:28.581 --> 06:29.673
Shit!

06:29.916 --> 06:31.907
This doesn't work without an audience.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.521
Outside. Let's go.

06:55.875 --> 06:56.705
Get in.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.729
Thank you.

07:24.904 --> 07:28.465
Thank you. Anything you
ever need, just ask me.

07:28.641 --> 07:32.077
You endangered your life and
the U.S. Marshals protecting you.

07:32.245 --> 07:33.234
What?

07:33.413 --> 07:35.404
You went to your old restaurant.

07:35.581 --> 07:39.483
You went back to Gennaro's?
Johnny, are you stupid?!

07:39.652 --> 07:41.142
It's the osso buco.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.255
I was fucking dying for a decent meal!

07:44.424 --> 07:47.325
Next time, you're dead!
This only happens once.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.097
Get out.

08:10.516 --> 08:11.949
That was our ride!

08:14.720 --> 08:15.652
Let's go.

08:15.822 --> 08:16.686
Go.

08:18.124 --> 08:21.184
You won't see me again.
But I'll know your every move.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.454
Use your heads, lie low
and no one will hurt you.

08:24.630 --> 08:28.964
Skip out on your testimony and I'll
deliver you to the Canelli family.

08:29.302 --> 08:30.291
I promise.

08:30.470 --> 08:33.962
I owe you big time. I'm a
stand-up guy, you got it?

08:34.140 --> 08:38.304
You ever need anything, you
let me know. What's your name?

08:38.477 --> 08:40.378
Honey, he doesn't want to be pen pals.

08:40.546 --> 08:43.481
Smile. You've just been erased.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.909
John, would you look at something?

09:18.184 --> 09:21.676
One is from our shop, the others
are real. What do you think?

09:27.527 --> 09:29.017
That's the fake.

09:31.264 --> 09:32.595
Who the hell is that?

09:32.765 --> 09:34.596
If I tell you, I'd have to kill you.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.701
Shut up and run this again.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.146
With a little sleight of hand...

10:26.319 --> 10:30.915
...one very dead John Doe trades
places with one very live scumbag.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.580
Robert, sit down.

10:34.493 --> 10:35.585
You know...

10:38.264 --> 10:41.597
...if God was as forgiving as WITSEC...

10:41.767 --> 10:43.667
...hell would be one empty joint.

10:44.003 --> 10:45.834
God doesn't have our court system.

10:48.174 --> 10:50.938
I understand you had a busy night.

10:51.444 --> 10:53.002
A witness got careless.

10:53.179 --> 10:55.170
-I see.
-I had to defuse the situation.

10:55.348 --> 10:58.442
And that included breaking
into the county morgue?

10:58.618 --> 11:03.351
Someone taught me that improvisation
is the heart of field work.

11:03.956 --> 11:04.888
It was you.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.615
In the old days. Weather's changed.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.956
Now every asshole in
Congress is down our backs.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.791
I'm telling you to walk softly.

11:13.032 --> 11:16.468
That's why Beller called me in?
Because of the morgue?

11:16.702 --> 11:18.033
No, no, no.

11:19.038 --> 11:21.472
He doesn't know anything about that.

11:21.641 --> 11:23.199
I don't think he has to.

11:23.709 --> 11:25.973
Shadow Ops still has some privileges.

11:27.046 --> 11:28.308
You're right.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.146
John...

11:32.485 --> 11:33.645
...good work.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.385
I had a good teacher.

11:35.888 --> 11:37.150
Bullshit.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.722
You had the best.

11:43.896 --> 11:48.492
14,640 some-odd people
under WITSEC protection...

11:48.668 --> 11:51.398
...and not one with a profile like this.

11:51.570 --> 11:52.662
That bad?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.671
That good. This young
lady, Miss Cullen...

11:56.075 --> 11:58.509
...is a real live, bona fide...

11:59.078 --> 12:00.670
...honest person.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.507
Then why does she need us?

12:02.748 --> 12:05.683
She's a senior executive
at Cyrez Corporation.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.012
They're major defense contractors.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.745
Top-secret weapons research.

12:09.922 --> 12:13.756
Looks like someone inside
Cyrez is selling out Uncle Sam.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.187
Feds need her to prove their case.

12:16.362 --> 12:19.593
She's the key witness in the
hottest scandal since lran-Contra.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.524
-When does this go down?
-Tomorrow.

12:21.701 --> 12:25.432
The sting's in place.
When it's over, she's all yours.

12:25.705 --> 12:28.196
Sealed file on relocate.
Your eyes only.

12:28.374 --> 12:32.367
As usual, only you and I will be privy
to the exact location of your witness.

12:32.545 --> 12:33.705
But, John...

12:34.046 --> 12:37.379
...there are some serious
players in Washington...

12:38.017 --> 12:39.541
...who could be badly burned.

12:44.623 --> 12:45.954
So could she.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.906
Welcome to Cyrez Corporation.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.588
Morning, Dave.

13:27.166 --> 13:27.996
She's in.

13:30.002 --> 13:31.094
Anything yet?

13:31.270 --> 13:32.259
Not yet.

13:35.007 --> 13:37.601
That's right, lady. We're right here.

13:56.962 --> 13:57.951
We're on.

14:02.501 --> 14:03.331
Hear me?

14:03.536 --> 14:04.696
We hear you.

14:04.904 --> 14:05.893
I look okay?

14:06.071 --> 14:07.629
Tell her she looks great.

14:07.807 --> 14:09.365
Not bad, Miss Cullen.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.541
Not bad for an amateur.

14:13.045 --> 14:14.478
We're right with you.

14:16.482 --> 14:17.380
Yeah.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.142
Then let's do it.

14:25.658 --> 14:27.649
-Good morning, Miss Cullen.
-Good morning.

14:27.827 --> 14:28.816
Station C?

14:29.829 --> 14:31.160
Yes.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.230
And how long today?

14:33.666 --> 14:34.724
10 minutes.

14:37.069 --> 14:38.058
Okay.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.254
You're doing just fine, Lee.

15:14.607 --> 15:16.871
Hope we bought the right combination.

15:18.944 --> 15:19.911
Bingo!

15:24.650 --> 15:25.275
Shit!

15:25.451 --> 15:28.284
It's okay. We lose
transmission in the vault.

15:28.621 --> 15:29.713
What now?

15:30.122 --> 15:31.612
Now we wait.

15:32.892 --> 15:36.794
She's only got 5 minutes
till the shift change.

16:45.364 --> 16:46.797
What's taking so long?

16:47.032 --> 16:49.796
Sweetheart, you've got 2 minutes left.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.838
Shouldn't have used her.

17:30.009 --> 17:31.738
Shit! She's out of time.

17:58.871 --> 18:01.271
Welcome back, Lee. We're with you.

18:08.847 --> 18:10.007
Miss Cullen...

18:10.182 --> 18:12.912
...Mr. Donahue would like to see you.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.518
In a minute.

18:14.687 --> 18:16.245
He said right now.

18:16.522 --> 18:18.353
-What's going on?
-They made us.

18:30.369 --> 18:33.270
Check the directory.
Where's Donahue's office?

18:33.439 --> 18:35.031
25th floor.

18:35.207 --> 18:36.196
I know.

18:36.542 --> 18:37.600
25th floor.

18:37.776 --> 18:40.267
Get ready to roll. It could go south.

18:43.115 --> 18:44.548
What is it, William?

18:49.788 --> 18:52.222
Someone I trusted for 5 years.

18:52.725 --> 18:55.387
Someone I told others could be trusted.

18:56.061 --> 18:57.323
I was pulling--

18:57.496 --> 18:58.258
Don't!

18:59.631 --> 19:02.293
We're way beyond bullshit here.

19:09.475 --> 19:10.635
Who do you work for?

19:11.810 --> 19:13.402
Shit, we're dead.

19:14.146 --> 19:16.080
I should ask you that question.

19:16.248 --> 19:18.409
I thought it was for the U.S.
government.

19:18.584 --> 19:20.245
Come on, Lee.

19:21.086 --> 19:22.986
What do you think we do here?

19:23.422 --> 19:25.413
This isn't the Red Cross.

19:25.758 --> 19:28.989
We make weapons.
Things that kill people.

19:29.495 --> 19:31.827
If the government won't pay the cost...

19:32.164 --> 19:34.428
...it's my job to find someone who will.

19:35.834 --> 19:38.667
Treason is part of the
corporate strategy?

19:40.172 --> 19:42.606
I asked who you were working for.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.340
You didn't tell me.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.272
My God.

19:45.444 --> 19:46.934
Holy shit.

19:50.783 --> 19:52.011
Christ.

19:52.184 --> 19:53.845
Get her out of there.

19:55.687 --> 19:57.177
What is this?

19:58.624 --> 20:00.182
A camera?

20:05.030 --> 20:09.023
For the FBl, William.
They heard everything you just said.

20:09.635 --> 20:11.125
They're watching us now.

20:13.639 --> 20:16.199
And you think that makes you safe?

20:20.846 --> 20:21.505
You...

20:22.548 --> 20:24.209
...have no fucking idea!

20:25.717 --> 20:27.548
How could you do this to me?

20:33.826 --> 20:35.987
I hope you understand, Lee.

20:36.562 --> 20:38.655
You leave me no choice.

20:59.184 --> 21:00.913
Wait a minute! Stop her!

21:02.521 --> 21:04.352
Stop! Hey!

21:08.694 --> 21:09.922
Go, go, go!

21:17.269 --> 21:18.429
Hard evidence.

21:20.439 --> 21:22.202
It's all yours, gentlemen.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.033
We've handled these situations before.

21:26.211 --> 21:28.202
You haven't answered my question.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.109
We told you there'd be risks.

21:30.616 --> 21:34.108
You told me I'd have complete
protection the entire time.

21:34.286 --> 21:37.050
It didn't go as smoothly
as we anticipated.

21:37.222 --> 21:38.780
That's an understatement.

21:38.957 --> 21:41.551
Remember, Miss Cullen, you came to us.

21:41.727 --> 21:45.288
I came to you with a clerical error.
You asked for my help.

21:45.464 --> 21:46.795
And we got it.

21:46.965 --> 21:50.401
If Cyrez sells weapons' technology,
that's high treason.

21:50.569 --> 21:54.972
This disk and your testimony will put
all the co-conspirators behind bars.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.904
You've done a great
service for your country.

21:58.577 --> 22:00.408
It's time to think about your safety.

22:08.587 --> 22:11.579
This is U.S. Marshal John Kruger,
Witness Protection Program.

22:11.757 --> 22:13.748
He'll handle your personal security.

22:14.493 --> 22:15.824
My protection?

22:16.128 --> 22:19.620
Your new identity, relocation.
I'll take you through it step-by-step.

22:20.766 --> 22:23.428
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.

22:24.169 --> 22:26.831
You're in an extremely
high-risk situation.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.498
Wasn't it explained to you?

22:31.443 --> 22:33.775
Your boss was just a middleman, Lee.

22:33.946 --> 22:36.107
There are more dangerous
people involved.

22:37.282 --> 22:39.773
You expect me to give up my whole life?

22:39.952 --> 22:43.183
Until the trial. Then you're
completely out of danger.

22:43.355 --> 22:45.118
And how do you know that?

22:45.290 --> 22:46.621
How do you know?

22:48.026 --> 22:51.462
Look, I will keep up my end of
the bargain. I will testify.

22:51.964 --> 22:53.295
But that's it.

22:54.366 --> 22:55.958
I'm going home.

23:01.707 --> 23:03.971
Put people on her right away...

23:04.209 --> 23:06.700
...or we'll need a seance
for her testimony.

23:07.312 --> 23:09.143
Who brought her into this?

23:09.314 --> 23:12.306
She volunteered. She had
security clearance....

23:12.484 --> 23:14.475
You told her it's a walk in the park.

23:14.653 --> 23:18.145
When she finds out her life isn't
her own anymore, it's too late.

23:18.323 --> 23:20.553
We had no case without her.

23:20.726 --> 23:24.492
It's easier to put her ass on
the line than yours, isn't it?

23:38.176 --> 23:38.904
Sully.

23:39.077 --> 23:40.567
Frediano, how you doing?

23:40.746 --> 23:42.737
Good. Have something for you.

23:42.914 --> 23:43.903
Let's see.

23:50.255 --> 23:51.244
Your receipt.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.251
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.222
It's me.

24:30.629 --> 24:32.392
Your music has arrived.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.302
Get Mr. Morehart down here.

26:15.233 --> 26:16.825
-It's me.
-Lee?

26:17.002 --> 26:19.402
I heard about Donahue. Are you okay?

26:19.571 --> 26:20.902
I'm fine.

26:21.406 --> 26:24.671
-I shouldn't have trusted them.
-Of course not. The Feds are idiots.

26:24.843 --> 26:26.504
They'll blow the case or bury it.

26:30.182 --> 26:31.513
The Feds are here.

26:32.684 --> 26:33.844
They're watching.

26:34.019 --> 26:37.750
Let me write this story and I'll
nail Cyrez all over the front page.

26:37.923 --> 26:39.914
It may not be safe to
talk on this phone.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.267
I'll call you.

26:49.434 --> 26:51.925
Wait. Did you make a copy?

26:52.103 --> 26:54.094
-Yeah.
-That's your insurance, Lee.

26:54.272 --> 26:56.706
Go public. They don't dare touch you.

27:00.946 --> 27:02.436
Lee, what's wrong?

27:02.714 --> 27:04.875
I don't know. I got to go.

27:10.789 --> 27:12.051
Hi, baby.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.880
What are you doing here?

27:14.059 --> 27:16.391
Waiting for you. How are you doing?

27:16.561 --> 27:19.121
So you just let yourself into my house?

27:19.297 --> 27:20.628
I've worried about you.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.060
I haven't heard from you in days.

27:23.235 --> 27:25.897
There's nothing to talk about.
It's over.

27:26.071 --> 27:27.231
You know that.

27:48.660 --> 27:49.490
Come on.

27:49.661 --> 27:51.925
That doesn't hurt you to say that?

27:52.097 --> 27:53.655
It hurt me 3 months ago.

27:53.832 --> 27:58.269
But after the phone calls, after
the notes on my car, and tonight...

27:58.937 --> 28:00.768
...it's getting a lot easier.

28:23.361 --> 28:24.521
Get down.

28:44.049 --> 28:45.209
Who're you seeing?

28:45.984 --> 28:47.542
Come on, Darryl.

28:47.719 --> 28:49.209
I know you're seeing someone.

28:51.823 --> 28:53.484
Let's see who that is.

28:57.562 --> 28:58.722
What's this?

28:58.997 --> 28:59.827
And a card.

28:59.998 --> 29:01.158
Get down!

29:08.907 --> 29:10.898
Oh, shit! Go, go, go!

29:23.254 --> 29:24.687
Come here!

29:28.360 --> 29:29.759
Stay down.

29:41.106 --> 29:42.539
I don't have a shot.

30:10.301 --> 30:11.893
You, go, go.

30:39.497 --> 30:41.829
-What are you doing?
-Lighting a fuse.

31:44.729 --> 31:46.060
Are you hit?

31:46.231 --> 31:47.562
Are you bleeding?

31:48.066 --> 31:49.158
I don't think so.

31:50.068 --> 31:52.662
-Are they following us?
-No. Just calm down.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.031
You'll be fine.

31:54.706 --> 31:55.934
I'm not fine.

31:56.107 --> 31:57.438
They tried to kill me!

31:59.010 --> 31:59.999
Darryl's dead.

32:00.845 --> 32:01.675
You're alive.

32:02.747 --> 32:04.339
Keep you that way.

32:07.418 --> 32:08.749
Your hand.

32:10.688 --> 32:13.020
There's a first aid kit under your seat.

32:16.594 --> 32:19.085
That weapon, or whatever it was...

32:19.264 --> 32:21.027
...was from your company, wasn't it?

32:21.266 --> 32:22.927
It's an E.M. prototype.

32:23.101 --> 32:24.693
It's not supposed to exist.

32:24.869 --> 32:25.597
E.M.?

32:25.770 --> 32:27.761
Electromagnetic pulse.

32:27.939 --> 32:30.533
No gunpowder, no conventional bullets.

32:30.708 --> 32:33.438
They fire aluminum rounds at
almost the speed of light.

32:34.112 --> 32:35.443
A rail gun.

32:36.114 --> 32:38.105
Yeah, that's another name for them.

32:38.449 --> 32:40.940
The Navy's worked on them for years.

32:41.119 --> 32:44.213
The smallest one I've heard of
is mounted on a battleship.

32:44.622 --> 32:47.455
Cyrez was contracted
to scale them down...

32:47.725 --> 32:50.455
...to design a compact
hypervelocity, pulse weapon...

32:50.628 --> 32:52.960
...most powerful assault rifle on earth.

32:53.131 --> 32:55.793
They took millions, then
said it was impossible.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.798
They looked real enough to me.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.470
Maybe Cyrez found a higher bidder.

33:00.805 --> 33:04.798
They're connected everywhere:
Defense, CIA, NSA...

33:05.243 --> 33:07.143
...maybe even your people.

33:09.647 --> 33:11.137
Still want to put them away?

33:13.985 --> 33:14.974
Yes.

33:16.421 --> 33:17.979
I'll hide you until the hearings.

33:18.489 --> 33:21.981
No one will know where.
Not my boss, not WITSEC.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.422
No one.

33:23.795 --> 33:24.784
Can you do that?

33:24.996 --> 33:29.262
The Feds knew it'd be a death sentence
for you, and let you walk right into it.

33:30.268 --> 33:31.599
I'm stupid.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.502
You trusted them, that's all.

33:35.273 --> 33:36.604
Now, trust me.

33:51.189 --> 33:52.781
This is Morehart.

33:53.024 --> 33:54.184
We have a problem.

33:55.193 --> 33:57.024
Go ahead. This line's secure.

33:58.963 --> 34:00.794
The Cullen woman is still alive.

34:00.965 --> 34:02.125
Are you serious?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.858
It gets worse.

34:04.035 --> 34:05.195
She has a disk.

34:05.470 --> 34:08.132
She tried to access our program with it.

34:09.641 --> 34:13.543
Do you have any idea the risk
I took to get this back?!

34:13.710 --> 34:16.202
I know. She must have made a duplicate.

34:16.813 --> 34:18.145
Then get it.

34:18.315 --> 34:19.647
Whatever it takes!

34:19.817 --> 34:20.976
Understood.

34:22.553 --> 34:23.884
One other thing.

34:24.322 --> 34:25.721
I checked her phone records.

34:25.889 --> 34:26.879
And?

34:27.725 --> 34:30.319
She called a woman named lsaacs.

34:30.495 --> 34:32.827
A reporter for the Washington Herald.

34:35.667 --> 34:36.827
I see.

34:39.070 --> 34:41.061
You know what has to be done.

34:41.672 --> 34:42.661
Do it.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.670
The Joint Chiefs are ready.

34:51.081 --> 34:53.016
I'll be right there. Thank you.

35:17.709 --> 35:20.109
That's it. That's everything I am.

35:20.611 --> 35:21.942
That's nothing.

35:22.113 --> 35:24.274
It's a few numbers and some plastic.

35:25.116 --> 35:26.777
What you are is in here.

35:27.452 --> 35:30.046
No one can take that from you.

35:32.557 --> 35:34.047
They'll try.

35:34.225 --> 35:35.886
We'll stop them.

35:42.734 --> 35:43.894
I need the rest.

35:45.136 --> 35:46.125
That's all.

35:46.304 --> 35:47.965
No. This.

35:49.407 --> 35:50.635
This?

35:56.748 --> 35:58.739
It's St. George.

36:00.985 --> 36:04.978
It's silly, but when I was a kid I
used to have nightmares about dragons.

36:05.823 --> 36:07.256
He watched over you.

36:07.425 --> 36:08.357
Yeah.

36:08.993 --> 36:10.984
Well, that's my job now.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.766
Get some sleep.

36:17.835 --> 36:19.268
We leave at dawn.

36:19.937 --> 36:21.097
Okay.

36:22.106 --> 36:23.095
Night.

36:41.025 --> 36:44.188
There's a place I know where
it's easy to disappear.

36:47.465 --> 36:49.695
There's a woman there I helped.

36:49.867 --> 36:53.200
She testified against the
yakuza bosses in San Francisco.

36:53.371 --> 36:55.532
Her new name is Mei-Ling.

36:56.140 --> 36:58.700
You'll be safe with
her until the hearings.

37:16.727 --> 37:18.558
Your new name is Deborah Elliott.

37:18.729 --> 37:21.220
You think of me as a "Deborah?"

37:21.833 --> 37:23.061
I don't know.

37:23.334 --> 37:25.996
I could have used
something more fun, like...

37:26.571 --> 37:27.731
...Debbie?

37:28.339 --> 37:29.169
Deb?

37:29.874 --> 37:30.863
Deborah's fine.

37:31.042 --> 37:32.270
AAA credit.

37:33.177 --> 37:34.075
What's my limit?

37:34.245 --> 37:36.577
It is not a license to shop.

37:36.747 --> 37:38.578
I want you to lay low right now.

37:38.749 --> 37:40.239
Mei-Ling will take care of you.

37:42.019 --> 37:43.179
You know the signal.

37:43.421 --> 37:45.252
911 . Get out of the apartment.

37:45.423 --> 37:48.517
Go straight to the pay
phone and wait for my call.

37:48.693 --> 37:52.754
It's a public place, with
6 exits and 6 ways out.

37:53.030 --> 37:54.088
And...

37:55.032 --> 37:56.590
...l work alone.

37:56.767 --> 37:59.759
If anyone comes to you
and claims I sent them...

38:02.206 --> 38:03.366
...use this.

38:04.108 --> 38:05.939
You just pull the trigger.

38:09.213 --> 38:11.044
I guess I won't see you again.

38:12.116 --> 38:14.209
If everything goes well...no.

38:15.119 --> 38:17.553
At least not until the trial.

38:20.625 --> 38:21.751
Thanks.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.121
Thank me when it's over.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.901
Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper...

38:41.078 --> 38:44.639
...spoke before Congress
today about the Cyrez scandal.

38:44.815 --> 38:47.409
Private contractors are
within parameters...

38:47.585 --> 38:50.076
...of Defense Department spending.

38:50.254 --> 38:54.088
I look forward to the Cyrez
hearing. I'm confident...

38:54.258 --> 38:57.159
...we'll be vindicated of
mismanagement of funds.

38:57.762 --> 39:01.163
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
for the opportunity.

39:16.747 --> 39:18.476
Thanks for coming.

39:18.649 --> 39:21.311
You know I don't like
meeting outside of work.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.316
It's not my choice.

39:23.487 --> 39:24.749
Are they with you?

39:27.158 --> 39:28.250
Yeah.

39:33.164 --> 39:34.995
Whether I like it or not....

39:35.166 --> 39:36.326
Listen, John...

39:38.769 --> 39:40.327
...we've got a problem.

39:40.838 --> 39:41.998
What's up?

39:43.341 --> 39:45.332
Someone's murdering our witnesses.

39:45.509 --> 39:48.501
We've got 3 confirmed
kills in the last 48 hours.

39:48.679 --> 39:50.271
-Who?
-Not one of yours.

39:50.448 --> 39:52.177
Not one of mine. Not yet.

39:52.350 --> 39:54.284
-Did they break cover?
-No.

39:54.452 --> 39:56.352
No, that is the problem.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.286
And there's no way anyone could
know all 3 of their locations.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.359
There's a mole inside WITSEC.

40:06.630 --> 40:09.121
Beller thinks so. He may be right.

40:09.533 --> 40:14.129
All 3 singers were witnesses in
some high profile federal cases.

40:14.305 --> 40:18.036
All with international ties.
That's our common thread.

40:18.809 --> 40:21.039
Other singers fit the profile.

40:21.212 --> 40:22.201
Six.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.974
One's yours and one's mine. So...

40:25.216 --> 40:27.980
...we have to replant them immediately.

40:28.152 --> 40:30.382
The jet is fueling as we speak.

40:30.721 --> 40:32.313
I work alone.

40:32.656 --> 40:33.645
You know that.

40:33.824 --> 40:35.223
Not today.

40:35.393 --> 40:36.826
Beller's orders.

40:37.061 --> 40:39.495
Buddy system, CIA escorts...

40:40.064 --> 40:41.827
...3 teams. We're one of them.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.159
Fine.

40:43.334 --> 40:44.995
We do yours first.

40:57.014 --> 40:58.572
This is John Kruger.

40:58.749 --> 41:02.241
These are agents Schiff and Calderon.
I forgot which is which.

41:02.420 --> 41:04.183
-I'm Schiff.
-And I'm Calderon.

41:04.355 --> 41:05.515
Know her?

41:06.257 --> 41:07.087
Should l?

41:07.258 --> 41:11.024
She was reporting on Cyrez.
It could be connected to your witness.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.028
Did someone take her out?

41:13.197 --> 41:15.028
Peeled her like an onion.

41:15.199 --> 41:17.258
If she knew anything, she talked.

41:19.370 --> 41:22.931
This here is Deputy Monroe.
He's one of ours.

41:23.274 --> 41:26.710
Monroe, you're looking at
a legend: Mr. John Kruger.

41:26.877 --> 41:28.936
-Deputy.
-Sir, it's a pleasure.

41:33.717 --> 41:35.207
Nice rig.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.883
-How many of these you got?
-Three.

41:38.055 --> 41:39.716
Different parts of the country.

41:39.890 --> 41:44.623
Handy for quick relocates. Sometimes
we run violent felons for the Feds.

41:45.296 --> 41:47.628
Chauffeurs for degenerates.

41:48.132 --> 41:50.566
Don't you get tired of babysitting scum?

41:50.734 --> 41:51.792
Yeah.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.630
But in your case, we'll
make an exception.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.703
Who the hell does he think he is?

42:04.081 --> 42:06.743
He thinks he's the best guy in the game.

42:06.917 --> 42:10.080
I think he's right.
Try not to piss him off.

42:38.115 --> 42:39.514
You're east.

42:39.683 --> 42:40.672
You're west.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.443
You're north. Here.

42:42.620 --> 42:45.282
We've got the boathouse,
garage, back door.

42:45.456 --> 42:46.480
Front entrance.

42:47.191 --> 42:48.453
You and me, buddy.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.692
I don't want to get shot today.

42:51.862 --> 42:53.625
Keep your safeties on.

42:53.797 --> 42:55.788
We'll find her inside baking muffins.

42:55.966 --> 42:57.365
This is my witness.

42:57.535 --> 43:00.629
Her name is Allison.
She's a very nice lady.

43:00.804 --> 43:02.795
So let's bring her out safely.

43:02.973 --> 43:03.962
Here you go.

43:06.877 --> 43:08.538
Let's go, big guy.

43:21.892 --> 43:23.655
The engine's still warm.

45:00.324 --> 45:01.484
Shut up!

45:03.827 --> 45:04.759
You're early.

45:04.928 --> 45:05.656
You're late.

45:33.357 --> 45:34.688
Hush, now.

45:37.194 --> 45:39.287
He won't hurt you anymore.

45:53.310 --> 45:54.709
Get an ambulance!

45:55.379 --> 45:56.471
Go on!

45:58.315 --> 45:59.873
Sorry, honey.

46:18.836 --> 46:20.235
We lost her.

46:22.172 --> 46:24.663
Why send 5 men to kill one woman?

46:28.846 --> 46:30.336
They were waiting for us.

46:30.748 --> 46:32.079
We've been set up.

46:35.519 --> 46:36.281
Yours?

46:42.393 --> 46:43.291
Call her.

46:43.527 --> 46:45.927
No phones. We must live-contact her.

46:46.430 --> 46:47.590
Where is she?

46:48.198 --> 46:49.426
Atlanta.

46:51.034 --> 46:52.695
Let's move, then.

47:08.719 --> 47:10.880
Here. You'll like this better.

47:28.138 --> 47:29.469
You all right?

47:31.575 --> 47:33.065
I think so, sir.

47:33.811 --> 47:35.142
First time under fire?

47:38.916 --> 47:40.747
It's okay to be shaky.

47:40.918 --> 47:42.647
Hell, I'm shaky.

47:44.488 --> 47:46.080
The thing is, sir...

47:47.257 --> 47:48.986
...l don't know what I feel.

47:49.426 --> 47:50.757
It was terrible and....

47:50.994 --> 47:53.485
Exciting at the same time?

47:55.766 --> 47:59.497
Nothing to be ashamed of.
It's perfectly natural.

48:00.270 --> 48:01.430
Tell him.

48:01.605 --> 48:02.469
It's natural.

48:11.348 --> 48:12.679
The game's that way.

48:14.518 --> 48:18.181
Like a drug. You get hooked,
there's no turning back.

48:41.144 --> 48:42.805
Take me.

48:44.047 --> 48:45.378
My old man...

48:46.650 --> 48:48.311
...a little nobody in D.C.

48:49.820 --> 48:51.048
Nice quiet guy.

48:51.722 --> 48:53.713
Anyway, on his deathbed...

48:54.391 --> 48:58.657
...he tells me that all those
years he was working for the CIA.

48:59.563 --> 49:01.497
I had to be part of that world.

49:01.665 --> 49:04.828
I joined the CIA, couple of years...
now I'm at WITSEC.

49:28.258 --> 49:29.589
Hey, buddy.

49:30.694 --> 49:33.686
What about you, sir?
Why did you join WITSEC?

49:36.934 --> 49:38.765
Sir, is something wrong?

49:39.269 --> 49:40.759
Answer the kid.

49:41.371 --> 49:42.599
Go ahead.

49:43.206 --> 49:44.264
Sir?

49:46.610 --> 49:48.043
Come on.

49:52.549 --> 49:54.107
You.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.065
What the hell is going on?

50:15.238 --> 50:16.569
He cleared the numbers.

50:16.740 --> 50:17.798
What the hell?!

50:17.975 --> 50:18.907
Quiet.

50:19.076 --> 50:20.976
Did you capture that call?

50:26.750 --> 50:28.809
Got it. New York prefix.

50:30.921 --> 50:32.081
Taxi!

50:34.825 --> 50:35.814
City Zoo.

50:36.259 --> 50:38.159
New York. Tell him to change course.

50:38.328 --> 50:41.092
-I'll call WITSEC.
-No, that won't be necessary.

50:41.264 --> 50:43.755
We must report flight plan changes.

50:43.934 --> 50:46.994
Monroe, you did great work
back there. Sit down.

50:47.170 --> 50:48.262
Sit down.

50:49.439 --> 50:51.669
Did I give you your evaluation yet?

50:52.609 --> 50:53.598
Evaluation?

50:56.013 --> 50:57.503
A+, kid.

50:59.282 --> 51:02.183
Damn it! Get me a
Wet-Nap or something!

51:03.020 --> 51:04.180
Who's in New York?

51:04.454 --> 51:06.183
4 or 5 guys we can trust.

51:07.624 --> 51:08.613
Get them.

51:09.459 --> 51:10.949
Clean this mess up.

51:35.886 --> 51:36.978
Confused?

51:38.655 --> 51:39.747
New York.

51:39.990 --> 51:41.389
You're off course.

51:42.492 --> 51:44.323
No, we're not.

51:46.396 --> 51:48.159
You'll take us to her.

51:54.671 --> 51:57.333
You did a very, very bad thing.

51:58.842 --> 52:00.002
You killed Monroe.

52:04.347 --> 52:06.747
Now that makes you the mole.

52:09.186 --> 52:11.245
That makes you a murderer.

52:13.356 --> 52:14.550
Easy, Big John.

52:18.528 --> 52:19.859
I'm a businessman.

52:23.366 --> 52:25.698
A very, very serious businessman.

52:25.869 --> 52:27.097
Businessman?

52:27.771 --> 52:30.262
Selling weapons to your old CIA pals?

52:30.707 --> 52:32.368
Is it just the money?

52:32.542 --> 52:35.375
Trying to start your own dirty,
little war somewhere?

52:35.612 --> 52:36.943
Wars?

52:37.547 --> 52:39.105
Wars, John?

52:39.716 --> 52:41.206
Wars come and go.

52:41.551 --> 52:43.781
We did Nam, we lost.

52:44.221 --> 52:45.950
We did the Gulf, we won.

52:46.623 --> 52:47.715
What changed?

52:48.225 --> 52:49.283
Nothing.

52:49.793 --> 52:51.124
Nothing ever does.

52:51.728 --> 52:54.458
The only difference is who
gets rich and who gets dead.

52:54.631 --> 52:57.122
Personally, John, I prefer rich.

52:57.968 --> 53:00.129
You must be a very rich man by now.

53:00.403 --> 53:02.132
It doesn't have to end like this.

53:02.639 --> 53:04.630
I can make you part of it. A big part.

53:05.575 --> 53:08.305
Just give up the girl. What do you say?

53:08.812 --> 53:10.143
Drop your gun.

53:10.981 --> 53:11.970
What?

53:12.649 --> 53:14.640
If you drop your gun now...

53:14.818 --> 53:16.649
...l promise I won't kill you.

53:22.492 --> 53:24.585
I'll have to take my chances.

53:50.954 --> 53:54.856
You nailed me with this cheap
piece of mail order shit!

54:07.637 --> 54:08.865
Think about it!

54:09.039 --> 54:11.030
You jump, you'll go through
there like shit through a goose!

54:11.541 --> 54:12.530
You're right!

54:26.489 --> 54:27.547
Engine fire!

55:51.074 --> 55:52.473
Turn this thing around!

55:52.642 --> 55:54.906
I'm trying to keep us in the air!

55:55.078 --> 55:57.308
Turn it around and take him out!
Now!

56:15.265 --> 56:18.496
I want his face all
over this windshield.

57:37.414 --> 57:39.746
Oh, man. Did that hurt?

57:39.949 --> 57:42.213
It had to hurt. I saw it.

57:44.220 --> 57:45.209
Where is this?

57:45.388 --> 57:46.286
Earth.

57:46.456 --> 57:47.787
Welcome.

57:55.065 --> 57:56.965
Is that your daddy's truck?

57:58.468 --> 58:00.800
Think he'd mind if I borrow it?

58:01.571 --> 58:03.061
I don't know.

58:03.973 --> 58:05.907
Is this yours?

58:08.311 --> 58:09.573
Like it?

58:09.779 --> 58:10.768
Yeah.

58:11.081 --> 58:12.742
What about a trade?

58:14.417 --> 58:16.078
50 bucks.

58:16.920 --> 58:18.581
50 bucks?

58:32.902 --> 58:34.130
Shit.

58:34.904 --> 58:37.634
We traced her to Chinatown,
but she was long gone.

58:37.807 --> 58:40.139
No shit, Dick Tracy.
It was a run signal.

58:40.310 --> 58:41.743
The cab companies?

58:41.911 --> 58:45.472
Three pickups of solo women
within 15 minutes of the call.

58:45.915 --> 58:47.075
Drop-offs?

58:47.317 --> 58:50.411
Madison and 53rd.
89th and Central Park West.

58:50.587 --> 58:51.918
New York City Zoo.

58:52.155 --> 58:53.486
-That's it.
-The zoo?

58:53.656 --> 58:57.148
First a run signal, then straight
to a public meeting place.

58:57.327 --> 58:59.158
-Your shooters?
-Standing by.

58:59.329 --> 59:02.423
I want two teams to sweep
from the north and south.

59:04.334 --> 59:05.426
Go!

59:37.534 --> 59:41.527
Ladies and gentlemen, the zoo
will be closing in 10 minutes.

59:43.206 --> 59:44.104
Miss Cullen?

59:45.708 --> 59:48.541
Ma'am, I'm here to help.
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

59:49.879 --> 59:51.210
Where's John Kruger?

59:51.814 --> 59:56.148
On his way. He sent me to be sure
you're safe until he gets here.

01:00:00.156 --> 01:00:01.214
Really?

01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:05.050
Then he showed you
the secret handshake?

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:12.323
Shit!

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.537
DeGuerin!

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.231
The bitch just shot me!

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:24.176
We're on our way. Don't kill her.
Do you hear me?

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:28.642
What's going on?

01:00:28.918 --> 01:00:30.909
U.S. Marshal. Close all exits.

01:00:31.087 --> 01:00:32.179
People are inside.

01:00:32.355 --> 01:00:33.913
Get them out, now!

01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:35.580
Let's go.

01:00:36.192 --> 01:00:37.420
You two, here.

01:00:37.594 --> 01:00:39.687
Everyone, please exit the zoo.

01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:42.197
Let's go, immediately!

01:00:42.365 --> 01:00:44.697
Police emergency! Thank you!

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:03.941
Come on!

01:01:43.593 --> 01:01:44.924
He's here.

01:02:25.134 --> 01:02:26.533
Hold your fire!

01:02:26.703 --> 01:02:27.533
Lee...

01:02:27.804 --> 01:02:29.863
...just drop your weapon.

01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:42.212
Move!

01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.652
-You're late!
-Traffic.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.893
-How's your ammo?
-I'm out.

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:02.333
Damn it! Two rounds left.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.832
Move!

01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:06.731
Ready to go?

01:03:07.076 --> 01:03:10.239
Stay down. When I say
so, head for the door.

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:13.006
Go.

01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:57.554
Let's go.

01:04:40.136 --> 01:04:41.899
You're luggage.

01:05:03.593 --> 01:05:05.083
How many casualties?

01:05:05.228 --> 01:05:08.163
Three. Kruger took them
out like that, cold.

01:05:08.331 --> 01:05:11.323
-I can't believe this.
-His prints were on the weapon.

01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:14.163
Run prints on him? That's moving fast.

01:05:16.005 --> 01:05:17.438
I was there.

01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:20.439
Why would he do a thing like this?

01:05:20.676 --> 01:05:21.665
Look...

01:05:21.944 --> 01:05:26.176
...the man has nothing to keep
him honest. He's been bought.

01:05:27.116 --> 01:05:29.016
I've known John for years.

01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:30.015
We're losing time.

01:05:31.354 --> 01:05:33.515
If he's innocent, why's he on the run?

01:05:33.689 --> 01:05:34.747
And his witness?

01:05:35.258 --> 01:05:36.850
She's in it with him.

01:05:37.026 --> 01:05:38.857
What the hell do you mean?

01:05:39.128 --> 01:05:42.529
We identified ourselves.
She shot one of my men.

01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:46.633
Fine.

01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:50.703
Do whatever it takes to bring him in.

01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:53.971
But--

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:55.074
Sir?

01:05:56.879 --> 01:05:58.369
Bring him in alive.

01:06:06.989 --> 01:06:08.217
Captain?

01:06:08.658 --> 01:06:10.558
Put out a citywide A.P.B.

01:06:10.726 --> 01:06:14.218
Lock this town up so tight
it'll make his balls ache.

01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:40.317
Beller.

01:06:40.756 --> 01:06:42.747
-Captain.
-John, where are you?

01:06:42.925 --> 01:06:47.419
DeGuerin is the mole. He killed
the others to flush out my witness.

01:06:47.597 --> 01:06:48.586
Come in.

01:06:48.764 --> 01:06:50.095
I'll protect my witness!

01:06:50.266 --> 01:06:53.030
You'll put her in danger.
You'll both end up dead.

01:06:53.202 --> 01:06:56.831
DeGuerin has been bought.
My witness knows too much.

01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:59.769
Federal agents say you are the shooter.

01:07:02.945 --> 01:07:04.276
I'll call you back.

01:07:04.447 --> 01:07:05.436
When?

01:07:05.615 --> 01:07:07.276
When I have proof.

01:07:15.858 --> 01:07:17.450
It's gone too far.

01:07:19.061 --> 01:07:20.722
We're on our own.

01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:22.730
What can we do?

01:07:23.232 --> 01:07:25.632
We can't stay on the run for long.

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.470
We need hard evidence.

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:47.018
You kept a copy?

01:07:47.323 --> 01:07:51.760
I was supposed to give it to
a friend of mine, a reporter.

01:07:52.094 --> 01:07:53.652
-She asked me--
-Claire lsaacs?

01:07:55.464 --> 01:07:56.692
How do you know?

01:07:59.268 --> 01:08:00.758
She's dead.

01:08:00.903 --> 01:08:02.370
They killed her.

01:08:04.106 --> 01:08:06.006
How could they have known?

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.301
-I didn't tell anyone.
-I know. It's not your fault.

01:08:08.644 --> 01:08:09.975
Maybe they tapped her phone.

01:08:10.146 --> 01:08:11.408
There's many ways....

01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:15.407
Everything's going to be all right.

01:08:15.618 --> 01:08:17.676
I was just trying to cover myself.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.180
I didn't know who I can trust.

01:08:20.856 --> 01:08:22.846
Now, I'll get us both killed.

01:08:23.024 --> 01:08:23.787
No.

01:08:24.126 --> 01:08:26.117
This may be all that keeps us alive.

01:08:26.295 --> 01:08:28.286
I don't even know what's on that.

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:29.625
We'll see.

01:08:30.933 --> 01:08:33.367
It's completely hacker-proof.

01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:36.430
There's no way to run it outside Cyrez.

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:39.033
Then we'll run it from the inside.

01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:44.301
It's like a fortress. We can't go
back there. They'd expect that.

01:08:45.548 --> 01:08:47.812
I'd hate to disappoint them.

01:08:49.952 --> 01:08:54.218
The streets are clear. The police
are safely back in their donut shops.

01:08:55.658 --> 01:08:57.216
This is Father Rodriguez.

01:08:57.893 --> 01:08:58.951
Pleasure.

01:08:59.228 --> 01:09:01.457
I was not always Father Rodriguez.

01:09:01.663 --> 01:09:04.962
I was born again, with a
little help from our friend.

01:09:05.401 --> 01:09:09.564
His Columbian associates wanted to
introduce him to God personally.

01:09:10.072 --> 01:09:12.165
I've been given a second chance at life.

01:09:12.341 --> 01:09:14.832
This time, I'm using it for God's work.

01:09:15.243 --> 01:09:16.734
Anything else I can do?

01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:19.479
We need a car. Just for a day or two.

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:21.071
Done.

01:09:21.183 --> 01:09:24.277
It burns as much oil as
gas, but it's yours.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.089
You sure about this?

01:09:34.263 --> 01:09:36.254
There's no one else I can trust.

01:09:56.218 --> 01:10:00.712
It's raining men,
Hallelujah it's raining men

01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:22.309
Hello, Johnny.

01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:24.242
Yo!

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:26.313
I need to talk to you right away.

01:10:31.153 --> 01:10:32.916
I've got one question.

01:10:33.055 --> 01:10:36.320
Was it your idea to hook me up
with the Village People here?

01:10:36.492 --> 01:10:37.925
You're safe?

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.051
From the mob, yeah.

01:10:40.663 --> 01:10:44.759
No self-respecting wiseguy would be
caught dead in a joint like this.

01:10:44.934 --> 01:10:47.266
Do me just one favor.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:51.666
Don't let on that I'm straight.
I don't want to break any hearts.

01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:52.930
Trust me.

01:10:53.075 --> 01:10:56.670
You said if I ever need anything,
I could come to you?

01:10:56.846 --> 01:10:58.177
I need your help.

01:10:58.948 --> 01:11:00.848
Wait. You need my help?

01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:03.179
Now.

01:11:03.953 --> 01:11:04.942
You got it.

01:11:05.087 --> 01:11:08.454
Cover me for a few seconds.
I got to help a friend.

01:11:08.691 --> 01:11:11.182
Who's he? He looks rough!

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.793
Don't start.

01:11:12.962 --> 01:11:15.089
Do you two need a moment alone?

01:11:16.799 --> 01:11:18.357
We're fine, thanks.

01:11:18.701 --> 01:11:20.191
Just an idea.

01:11:20.469 --> 01:11:22.960
Kevin just...worries about me.

01:11:24.373 --> 01:11:25.601
Don't ask.

01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:31.973
You want me to help
you break into Cyrez?

01:11:32.114 --> 01:11:32.978
Yeah.

01:11:33.115 --> 01:11:34.480
You shitting me?

01:11:34.617 --> 01:11:37.313
I thought I'd help you
move a sofa or something.

01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:39.044
Pull over up ahead.

01:11:40.623 --> 01:11:42.215
I'll help you out.

01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:46.122
All we need is some tanks,
a few rocket launchers...

01:11:46.495 --> 01:11:50.226
...and a set of balls
like the King of Bayonne.

01:11:50.499 --> 01:11:51.625
You need these.

01:11:55.237 --> 01:11:56.829
I'll meet you at his place.

01:12:01.243 --> 01:12:03.074
I look like I've got gas?

01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:27.397
Gentlemen.

01:12:27.603 --> 01:12:29.264
What's going on?

01:12:29.672 --> 01:12:31.663
It will be contained in 24 hours.

01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:33.171
Not good enough.

01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:36.543
We have problems. They're solvable.

01:12:37.046 --> 01:12:38.536
We must cancel the shipment.

01:12:38.747 --> 01:12:39.771
Not an option.

01:12:39.949 --> 01:12:44.181
What do we do with 10 tons of assault
weapons that's not supposed to exist.

01:12:44.386 --> 01:12:47.048
I am the eyes and ears of your world.

01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:48.884
There's too much heat.

01:12:49.058 --> 01:12:50.389
You don't get it.

01:12:50.559 --> 01:12:52.550
The money has changed hands.

01:12:52.695 --> 01:12:55.892
These are not the kind
of people you cancel on.

01:13:00.803 --> 01:13:03.704
Get those guns out of the
country tonight or you're dead.

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:06.697
Now...

01:13:07.142 --> 01:13:09.633
...how will you contain the situation?

01:13:09.912 --> 01:13:12.813
Kruger has to show up at Cyrez.
I'll be waiting.

01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:14.313
Why would he risk it?

01:13:14.483 --> 01:13:18.977
The disk is the only thing
that'll clear him and the woman.

01:13:19.154 --> 01:13:20.587
This better work.

01:13:20.723 --> 01:13:23.590
The disk. The girl. The guns.

01:13:23.726 --> 01:13:25.990
By dawn, they don't exist. Clear?

01:13:26.662 --> 01:13:27.651
Yeah.

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.161
Crystal.

01:13:29.999 --> 01:13:33.435
In 2 weeks, the House Armed
Services Committee announced...

01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:36.935
...it will begin official
hearings into the Cyrez scandal.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.672
It's crawling with reporters.
We've got to keep a lid on this mess.

01:13:42.845 --> 01:13:47.612
By tomorrow you'll be chuckling about
this in your kiss-ass country club.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.240
Who's running this camera?

01:13:49.451 --> 01:13:50.509
I am.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.113
This is Haggerty, head of security.

01:13:53.255 --> 01:13:54.244
Good.

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:58.250
We'll keep everything
nice and low-profile?

01:13:58.694 --> 01:14:00.025
Ever do any wetwork?

01:14:00.195 --> 01:14:02.026
On 3 different continents.

01:14:02.197 --> 01:14:05.189
To impress me, Slick,
do your fucking job.

01:14:05.367 --> 01:14:07.028
How many people do you have?

01:14:07.202 --> 01:14:10.262
12 professionals.
They'll do what it takes.

01:14:10.472 --> 01:14:14.203
Plus 20 more on the security
force, who'll follow orders.

01:14:14.376 --> 01:14:15.468
Fine.

01:14:15.644 --> 01:14:19.478
Make sure my man has
your full cooperation.

01:14:19.648 --> 01:14:23.277
We've got every possible
point-of-entry under surveillance...

01:14:23.485 --> 01:14:25.385
...from the rooftop to the sewers.

01:14:25.554 --> 01:14:26.714
He's a ghost.

01:14:26.889 --> 01:14:30.655
If he wants in, he'll get in.
Where's he go to run this disk?

01:14:30.793 --> 01:14:33.660
The central vault.
No other terminal can access it.

01:14:34.163 --> 01:14:37.223
To read the disk,
there's only one way in.

01:14:38.567 --> 01:14:40.501
Outstanding, gentlemen.

01:14:41.003 --> 01:14:45.235
All we do is sit back and wait
for Mr. Kruger to come to us.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.172
Where are you going?

01:14:53.315 --> 01:14:57.308
Take it easy. I've got a
delivery for Blevens, 14th floor.

01:14:57.519 --> 01:14:59.578
We can't accept any deliveries.

01:14:59.755 --> 01:15:01.746
"We can't accept any deliveries."

01:15:02.191 --> 01:15:04.182
I'm just messing with you, man.

01:15:04.426 --> 01:15:08.089
Call Blevens to authorize it.
Pepperoni and cheese.

01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:11.329
Maybe you don't understand.

01:15:11.533 --> 01:15:13.694
This is a high-security facility.

01:15:13.936 --> 01:15:18.339
You don't understand.
This is a Papa Genoche's pizza.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.533
If he doesn't get it while it's still
hot, he gets two free out of my pocket!

01:15:22.711 --> 01:15:24.702
-I'm trying to save for a computer.
-Search him.

01:15:24.847 --> 01:15:26.542
Get your hands off me!

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:29.612
Listen...

01:15:29.852 --> 01:15:32.286
...l got a bad heart and a good lawyer.

01:15:32.454 --> 01:15:33.443
Shut up.

01:15:34.456 --> 01:15:35.616
He's clean.

01:15:38.293 --> 01:15:39.726
Cheese and pepperoni.

01:15:45.634 --> 01:15:47.124
Pal, hit the road.

01:15:47.369 --> 01:15:48.563
I said, go!

01:15:59.481 --> 01:16:01.073
What's going on?

01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:04.083
Pizza delivery guy is having a seizure.

01:16:04.253 --> 01:16:05.743
Who ordered a pizza?

01:16:05.888 --> 01:16:09.483
This is all we need. Get him
to the infirmary immediately.

01:16:31.813 --> 01:16:34.680
-How're we doing?
-We'll be on the road in an hour.

01:16:34.917 --> 01:16:37.010
They roll or I need to know why.

01:16:37.186 --> 01:16:38.244
Yes, sir.

01:16:38.687 --> 01:16:40.678
Come on! Let's move it!

01:16:44.693 --> 01:16:45.921
You're expected.

01:16:46.929 --> 01:16:49.090
Infirmary is through the loading dock.

01:16:49.264 --> 01:16:50.253
Patient stable?

01:16:50.432 --> 01:16:51.763
I'm not sure. Hurry.

01:16:51.934 --> 01:16:53.026
Thank you.

01:17:10.219 --> 01:17:12.710
He looks stable. Give him some oxygen.

01:17:21.463 --> 01:17:23.226
He's fibrillating! Code blue!

01:17:23.465 --> 01:17:25.057
No, it's okay!

01:17:29.972 --> 01:17:30.870
Gel.

01:17:34.142 --> 01:17:35.302
Clear!

01:17:38.747 --> 01:17:40.874
This way. They're waiting for you.

01:17:41.984 --> 01:17:44.077
Here we go again. Clear!

01:17:46.989 --> 01:17:48.251
Increase voltage.

01:17:50.592 --> 01:17:52.583
Let's do it one more time.

01:17:53.662 --> 01:17:54.594
Let's not.

01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:58.595
You, over there, against the wall.

01:17:58.767 --> 01:17:59.995
On the floor.

01:18:00.502 --> 01:18:01.833
Face the wall.

01:18:03.005 --> 01:18:03.994
On the floor.

01:18:04.172 --> 01:18:05.503
My God! Terrorists!

01:18:05.674 --> 01:18:07.164
You want terror?

01:18:07.843 --> 01:18:10.334
You want some fricking terror?!

01:18:10.512 --> 01:18:12.104
I'll jump-start your ass!

01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:13.111
Tape them.

01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:15.276
Face the wall!

01:18:18.687 --> 01:18:19.779
Keep it secure.

01:18:21.423 --> 01:18:22.617
Handle that?

01:18:22.924 --> 01:18:23.913
Get out!

01:18:27.362 --> 01:18:28.522
Let's go.

01:18:36.138 --> 01:18:37.366
We have a problem.

01:18:37.639 --> 01:18:39.038
What is it?

01:18:40.142 --> 01:18:42.201
-He's running the disk.
-Shit!

01:18:42.377 --> 01:18:43.537
Impossible.

01:18:43.712 --> 01:18:46.044
Any activity at Station 1?

01:18:46.214 --> 01:18:47.545
All clear.

01:18:47.716 --> 01:18:50.810
My ass! He's in.
He just didn't use the door.

01:18:50.952 --> 01:18:53.216
Get your men down there, now! Go!

01:19:15.477 --> 01:19:17.968
-What are you doing?
-No, I know this.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.078
It changes.

01:19:19.247 --> 01:19:21.738
Screw that. Get out of the way.

01:19:24.986 --> 01:19:26.078
Check it.

01:19:43.372 --> 01:19:44.930
Somebody talk to me.

01:19:45.107 --> 01:19:48.508
He's at a remote terminal
somewhere in the building.

01:19:51.513 --> 01:19:53.447
-You said he couldn't.
-He can't.

01:19:53.715 --> 01:19:56.445
Donahue designed it so
no outside activity--

01:19:56.618 --> 01:19:58.108
Donahue is dead.

01:19:58.954 --> 01:20:02.788
You'll wish you were too, if you
don't find out what's going on...

01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:04.949
...and you find out now.

01:20:05.127 --> 01:20:06.958
-Holster it.
-Take a hike, junior.

01:20:07.462 --> 01:20:09.453
I said, holster your--

01:20:14.136 --> 01:20:18.800
Some people take things for granted,
like the ability to chew solid food.

01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:20.130
I'll find him.

01:20:22.544 --> 01:20:23.533
How?

01:20:23.979 --> 01:20:27.312
I'll scan the terminals,
eliminate them one by one.

01:20:27.482 --> 01:20:29.746
If he stays on-line, I'll nail him.

01:20:30.419 --> 01:20:31.408
Do it.

01:20:33.422 --> 01:20:34.480
How we doing?

01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:38.323
You were right. Donahue
left himself a back door.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.755
But we still have to break his code.

01:20:43.165 --> 01:20:46.999
We've got another 5 or 6
minutes until they trace us.

01:20:49.337 --> 01:20:50.668
Recognize this?

01:20:50.839 --> 01:20:51.498
No.

01:20:51.673 --> 01:20:54.005
Warmer. It's an accounting format.

01:20:54.176 --> 01:20:56.508
Stop me if I get lucky.

01:20:59.347 --> 01:21:00.177
How we doing?

01:21:00.348 --> 01:21:02.179
Eliminating low clearance programs.

01:21:02.584 --> 01:21:04.279
South wing is clean.

01:21:04.453 --> 01:21:05.511
Two to go.

01:21:05.687 --> 01:21:08.520
Two federal investigators
downstairs want to talk.

01:21:09.524 --> 01:21:12.459
Do what you've got to do,
but get rid of them.

01:21:12.594 --> 01:21:15.028
-You can't be seen here.
-I won't be. Go.

01:21:17.466 --> 01:21:19.696
I need a chopper on the roof.

01:21:19.868 --> 01:21:20.800
Right.

01:21:22.537 --> 01:21:24.368
Those are offshore banking deposits.

01:21:24.806 --> 01:21:27.297
"UBS." That's Union de Banques Suisses.

01:21:27.476 --> 01:21:29.376
$52 million.

01:21:30.378 --> 01:21:32.972
If it's an arms sale, it's a major one.

01:21:33.114 --> 01:21:34.877
Let's see who their buyer is.

01:21:38.053 --> 01:21:39.213
"Sergei...

01:21:39.387 --> 01:21:41.378
...lvanovich Petrofsky."

01:21:41.756 --> 01:21:42.745
Who's that?

01:21:43.225 --> 01:21:44.317
Bad news.

01:21:45.627 --> 01:21:47.492
Head of a cartel in the Russian Mafia...

01:21:48.063 --> 01:21:51.999
...selling drugs, guns and
influence to very unpleasant people.

01:21:56.905 --> 01:21:58.338
He's in the north wing.

01:21:58.507 --> 01:21:59.633
Get moving.

01:22:00.242 --> 01:22:01.402
Let's go.

01:22:02.344 --> 01:22:03.641
-How long?
-I don't know.

01:22:03.845 --> 01:22:06.643
15 terminals are
running secure programs.

01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:11.842
You got 5 minutes.
Find them and call me.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.351
Let's go.

01:22:15.524 --> 01:22:17.515
There it is. Delivery date...

01:22:18.426 --> 01:22:20.018
...tonight, midnight.

01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:22.425
1,000 units to Baltimore Harbor.

01:22:22.597 --> 01:22:24.087
1,000 units of what?

01:22:31.373 --> 01:22:33.603
1,000 E.M. guns.

01:22:34.109 --> 01:22:37.272
Are they insane?
lf these get offshore....

01:22:37.612 --> 01:22:40.672
There will be a whole new
era of world terrorism.

01:22:45.887 --> 01:22:48.879
Got him. 25th floor, Donahue's office.

01:22:49.057 --> 01:22:51.685
Scramble. Alpha Chief
to the north wing, now!

01:22:54.396 --> 01:22:55.624
They're onto us.

01:22:56.965 --> 01:22:58.956
They're erasing the goddamn disk.

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:38.604
Come on!

01:23:51.753 --> 01:23:54.449
I'll cover you.
Meet me at the ambulance.

01:23:54.623 --> 01:23:55.681
Go!

01:24:07.969 --> 01:24:09.459
Lee, run!

01:24:21.783 --> 01:24:23.148
Listen, John!

01:24:23.284 --> 01:24:24.683
My rules!

01:24:25.787 --> 01:24:29.223
Mess with me, I'll mail her
back to you in little pieces.

01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:45.799
Fire alert.

01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:46.905
Fire Alert.

01:24:47.308 --> 01:24:51.301
This is not a drill. Please
proceed to the nearest exit.

01:25:23.778 --> 01:25:26.770
In this car I can get us to
Baltimore in 40 minutes.

01:25:26.948 --> 01:25:29.041
You're not coming with me.

01:25:29.284 --> 01:25:31.047
I'll drop you off.

01:25:31.219 --> 01:25:33.551
Don't give me this, "I work alone" shit.

01:25:33.722 --> 01:25:36.953
You've already done enough.
This is not your fight.

01:25:37.292 --> 01:25:40.784
Look, just indulge me
for a minute, okay?

01:25:41.129 --> 01:25:42.790
If it weren't for you...

01:25:42.964 --> 01:25:46.866
...my tongue would be hanging
on Canelli's trophy wall.

01:25:47.469 --> 01:25:49.460
Look, you need me.

01:25:50.739 --> 01:25:53.367
My cousin Tony runs those docks.

01:25:53.575 --> 01:25:56.237
If your ship is there, he will find it.

01:26:21.102 --> 01:26:22.660
You're short one envelope.

01:26:22.837 --> 01:26:24.600
Infantino didn't pay.

01:26:25.006 --> 01:26:26.906
What do you mean, didn't pay?

01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:28.700
What'd he say?

01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:31.674
He said, "Tell that fat
fuck Tony Two-toes...

01:26:31.846 --> 01:26:33.837
...l ain't paying him another dime."

01:26:34.682 --> 01:26:36.343
I know that voice.

01:26:36.618 --> 01:26:38.176
But it can't be him.

01:26:40.188 --> 01:26:42.122
Not unless he's a ghost.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.020
Boo.

01:26:47.695 --> 01:26:49.185
Johnny C. !

01:26:49.998 --> 01:26:51.397
You got whacked!

01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:54.033
Must have been another guy.

01:26:54.803 --> 01:26:57.363
Another guy rat out Canelli too?

01:26:57.539 --> 01:26:59.370
Canelli's a piece of shit.

01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:01.941
I got no love for Canelli, either.

01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:04.202
But...

01:27:06.447 --> 01:27:08.813
...this time you went over the line.

01:27:10.318 --> 01:27:11.444
I'm still here.

01:27:12.654 --> 01:27:14.884
What you did was wrong.

01:27:15.056 --> 01:27:18.548
He got a drug dealer and
his poison off the streets.

01:27:20.562 --> 01:27:22.029
Whose the tree trunk?

01:27:23.064 --> 01:27:25.225
This is the guy who saved my ass.

01:27:25.567 --> 01:27:27.159
My cousin, Tony Two-toes.

01:27:27.735 --> 01:27:28.429
That's Sal.

01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:32.171
Little Mike.

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.672
Your funeral was absolutely beautiful.

01:27:35.343 --> 01:27:37.675
Canelli finds out he's still breathing--

01:27:37.846 --> 01:27:41.247
Screw Canelli. We got
bigger problems. Tell him.

01:27:41.416 --> 01:27:43.247
There's a major arms deal going down.

01:27:43.918 --> 01:27:47.081
A U.S. contractor's selling out
to international terrorists.

01:27:52.493 --> 01:27:56.088
Mr. 60 Minutes. Tell me
something I don't know.

01:27:56.264 --> 01:27:58.926
It will happen tonight on your docks.

01:28:01.202 --> 01:28:03.193
That I didn't know.

01:28:08.877 --> 01:28:10.606
Quite a lot of security.

01:28:11.112 --> 01:28:12.511
Expecting trouble?

01:28:13.615 --> 01:28:15.708
I'm a Boy Scout. Always be prepared.

01:28:15.884 --> 01:28:17.112
Why's she here?

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:21.282
Just think of her as
an insurance policy...

01:28:21.522 --> 01:28:24.013
...if someone crashes the party.

01:28:24.626 --> 01:28:26.457
You're not telling me something.

01:28:26.628 --> 01:28:30.029
Just a bump in the carpet.
Nothing for you to worry about.

01:28:31.299 --> 01:28:34.029
Relax. You'll be out
of here in 20 minutes.

01:28:34.969 --> 01:28:36.402
What about her?

01:28:37.639 --> 01:28:38.970
Whatever.

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:42.041
Once you're in international
waters, her policy expires.

01:28:42.243 --> 01:28:43.540
Personally...

01:28:43.978 --> 01:28:46.742
...l'd shoot her and
throw her overboard.

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:50.640
It would be such a shame.

01:28:50.919 --> 01:28:52.750
Don't even think about it.

01:28:56.557 --> 01:29:00.550
I think and do what I like.
You will soon learn about this.

01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:03.922
Last crate's on its way.

01:29:05.433 --> 01:29:06.991
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

01:29:10.838 --> 01:29:11.827
DeGuerin....

01:29:22.583 --> 01:29:24.676
This is Kruger. Get me Beller.

01:29:25.853 --> 01:29:27.684
Start a trace on this.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.191
I've got proof Cyrez is selling
weapons on the black market.

01:29:36.364 --> 01:29:37.854
Daniel Harper's in on it.

01:29:38.032 --> 01:29:40.296
Undersecretary of Defense Harper?

01:29:40.468 --> 01:29:42.868
Yes. DeGuerin is their facilitator.

01:29:43.037 --> 01:29:45.369
He is the mole.
It all goes down tonight.

01:29:45.873 --> 01:29:48.364
Come and get me. Baltimore docks.

01:29:48.543 --> 01:29:50.204
Pier 57.

01:30:14.335 --> 01:30:15.324
Report.

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:17.401
Range is clear.

01:30:17.572 --> 01:30:19.005
Not a creature is stirring.

01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:25.640
Clear on the south.

01:30:27.248 --> 01:30:28.738
Quiet on the east.

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.514
Listen up. This is the last load.

01:30:31.652 --> 01:30:34.519
Keep your heads up and
your assholes puckered.

01:30:34.756 --> 01:30:36.917
If he's out there, I want him.

01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.860
Sunshine....

01:30:44.098 --> 01:30:45.929
I want to talk to you.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.159
This is a restricted area.

01:30:48.369 --> 01:30:52.100
You're telling me.
What the hell are you doing here?

01:30:52.306 --> 01:30:53.273
Excuse me?

01:30:53.441 --> 01:30:55.773
We're from Local 129, sonny.

01:30:55.943 --> 01:31:00.778
We heard you was loading a ship without
assistance of bona fide union labor.

01:31:00.948 --> 01:31:02.438
Say it ain't so.

01:31:03.184 --> 01:31:04.776
Sir, we have a situation.

01:31:05.119 --> 01:31:06.609
You certainly do.

01:31:06.788 --> 01:31:08.779
Stand by. We're coming to you.

01:31:16.964 --> 01:31:18.397
What is it?

01:31:18.566 --> 01:31:20.625
I'll explain something to you.

01:31:20.802 --> 01:31:25.136
Nothing moves off these docks without
it don't get loaded by the union.

01:31:25.473 --> 01:31:28.203
I don't see no union people around here.

01:31:28.409 --> 01:31:29.205
Do you?

01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:33.642
This is a matter of national security.
Clear this area immediately!

01:31:33.815 --> 01:31:35.214
That's a threat?

01:31:35.416 --> 01:31:37.077
Absolutely.

01:31:51.232 --> 01:31:52.324
What was that?

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.933
Gunfire at the warehouse!

01:32:00.842 --> 01:32:03.174
Nobody screws with the union.

01:32:09.117 --> 01:32:10.607
Perimeter, check in.

01:32:11.018 --> 01:32:12.451
Talk to me!

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.178
We have a security breach.

01:32:14.355 --> 01:32:16.516
Check it out! Get that crane moving!

01:33:11.913 --> 01:33:14.507
Movement in the southwest corner.

01:33:17.018 --> 01:33:17.882
It's nothing.

01:33:25.426 --> 01:33:26.916
There they are.

01:33:27.428 --> 01:33:28.759
Commie bastards.

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:33.765
Not Communists. They're a federation
of independent liberated states.

01:33:33.935 --> 01:33:36.199
Don't make me hurt you, Mikey.

01:33:36.337 --> 01:33:38.532
Keep your eyes on that crane.

01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:40.230
Can I hit that guy from here?

01:33:43.844 --> 01:33:47.439
You're lucky if you hit the
floor if you fell on it.

01:33:52.653 --> 01:33:53.483
Got him.

01:33:53.654 --> 01:33:54.552
30 yards.

01:33:54.722 --> 01:33:55.711
Fry the bastard.

01:34:03.764 --> 01:34:05.095
Jesus Christ.

01:34:25.486 --> 01:34:27.147
Fuck me!

01:34:31.892 --> 01:34:33.587
I think we got him!

01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:35.251
He's toast!

01:34:35.997 --> 01:34:37.658
I think we even got the roaches.

01:34:38.099 --> 01:34:40.158
Royce, Somes, you're recon.

01:34:40.334 --> 01:34:42.325
Bring me back the good news.

01:34:42.503 --> 01:34:44.164
E.M. team, cover them.

01:34:44.672 --> 01:34:45.832
Roger.

01:35:17.705 --> 01:35:19.434
Come on, goddamn it.

01:35:50.905 --> 01:35:52.736
Nice shotgun, asshole.

01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:31.833
Schiff! Calderon!

01:37:34.341 --> 01:37:35.740
They missed.

01:37:39.079 --> 01:37:40.171
Johnny?

01:37:40.514 --> 01:37:42.175
I'll be right out.

01:37:45.019 --> 01:37:46.418
Open fire!

01:38:02.102 --> 01:38:04.195
It looks as if your friend has arrived.

01:38:04.371 --> 01:38:06.430
I'll enjoy introducing him to you.

01:38:06.607 --> 01:38:10.941
I won't have the pleasure.
He's forced me to hasten our departure.

01:38:11.946 --> 01:38:13.379
And yours.

01:39:36.363 --> 01:39:37.694
Goddamn it!

01:39:37.865 --> 01:39:39.958
Now you are pissing me off!

01:39:42.036 --> 01:39:43.196
Drop the guns.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:46.870
Now.

01:39:57.051 --> 01:39:58.211
Thanks.

01:39:59.653 --> 01:40:00.642
Shut up!

01:40:02.389 --> 01:40:04.323
Take it up! Now!

01:42:12.853 --> 01:42:14.844
Here. Grab the ladder.

01:42:21.462 --> 01:42:22.326
Hold on.

01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:25.689
Say good-bye, John.

01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:30.698
Good-bye.

01:43:15.415 --> 01:43:16.905
John, buddy!

01:43:18.752 --> 01:43:20.413
Don't let me go like this.

01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:23.679
Help me!

01:43:39.706 --> 01:43:40.866
Son-of-a-bitch!

01:43:43.944 --> 01:43:45.104
Drop the gun!

01:44:21.815 --> 01:44:23.248
Get him out!

01:44:35.262 --> 01:44:36.661
Thank you, John.

01:44:42.402 --> 01:44:43.130
Ready?

01:44:43.303 --> 01:44:44.668
Let's go!

01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:20.965
How does it feel to be
indicted for treason?

01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:22.472
No comment.

01:45:22.643 --> 01:45:25.544
Marshal DeGuerin! What about you?

01:45:25.979 --> 01:45:27.207
I'm proud.

01:45:27.381 --> 01:45:28.370
Of treason?

01:45:28.982 --> 01:45:30.813
Of my patriotism.

01:45:31.718 --> 01:45:33.879
Our actions stopped a secret alliance...

01:45:34.054 --> 01:45:37.649
...this administration has had
with some of our worst enemies.

01:45:38.659 --> 01:45:40.991
The public deserves to know the truth.

01:45:41.161 --> 01:45:43.220
When we're in court, they will.

01:45:47.501 --> 01:45:49.162
They could get away with this.

01:45:49.336 --> 01:45:51.236
If Morehart takes the fall.

01:45:54.408 --> 01:45:55.841
You did well.

01:45:57.577 --> 01:46:00.171
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:46:02.349 --> 01:46:03.748
Ready?

01:46:12.526 --> 01:46:14.426
Pretty impressive speech.

01:46:15.028 --> 01:46:18.088
Learn to keep your mouth
shut in front of the press.

01:46:18.765 --> 01:46:20.528
Doesn't matter, anyway.

01:46:22.869 --> 01:46:25.429
It'll never go to trial without her.

01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:22.490
I'm not sure we should start again.

01:47:22.662 --> 01:47:23.390
Why not?

01:47:23.597 --> 01:47:27.158
With the bitch gone, we'll
spin doctor ourselves clean.

01:47:27.334 --> 01:47:30.497
What if she's told her
friends, her family?

01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:32.501
Fuck her family and friends.

01:47:32.672 --> 01:47:34.833
I'll kill them. One by one.

01:47:35.175 --> 01:47:37.166
Next year, she won't even be a memory.

01:47:37.344 --> 01:47:39.437
Robert, you always amaze me.

01:47:39.846 --> 01:47:41.609
Me? Thank you.

01:47:42.115 --> 01:47:44.675
But I got to hand it to you, Danny.

01:47:44.851 --> 01:47:47.342
That was brilliant work back there.

01:47:48.288 --> 01:47:49.516
What?

01:47:49.856 --> 01:47:51.016
The van.

01:47:51.191 --> 01:47:53.785
It was beautiful, clean, swift.

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.690
Witnesses will say we
were never near it.

01:47:56.863 --> 01:47:58.194
I like your style.

01:47:58.365 --> 01:48:00.356
You know, you remind me of me.

01:48:00.801 --> 01:48:02.530
I thought you set that up.

01:48:02.702 --> 01:48:04.135
Didn't you--

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.198
What the hell?

01:48:11.044 --> 01:48:11.976
What is it?

01:48:27.727 --> 01:48:28.694
Hello?

01:48:32.065 --> 01:48:33.396
It's for you.

01:48:39.339 --> 01:48:41.330
You've just been erased.

01:48:54.354 --> 01:48:56.083
Oh, my God!

01:48:56.923 --> 01:48:58.185
Let me out!

01:48:58.859 --> 01:48:59.848
Break it!

01:49:00.026 --> 01:49:01.186
Get off of me!

01:49:32.459 --> 01:49:33.391
What happened.

01:49:38.298 --> 01:49:40.061
They caught a train.

01:49:41.305 --> 01:49:47.482
