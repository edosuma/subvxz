01:38.298 --> 01:39.731
Brother.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.436
My Lord Beothric.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.107
He is mortally wounded.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.276
Brother...

01:51.278 --> 01:53.912
you're a king now.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.381
Rule well...

01:56.383 --> 01:58.750
as Father would have wished.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.323
Eirick. Brother!

02:08.328 --> 02:12.297
<i>Everybody has a story to tell
about their lives.</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:16.535
<i>My story begins the day I die.</i>

02:21.941 --> 02:24.710
<i>There is in nature
an irregular occurrence</i>

02:24.712 --> 02:28.580
<i>when the sun burns red
as the moon crosses its path.</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:31.783
<i>This is the Blood Eclipse,</i>

02:31.785 --> 02:33.952
<i>a time when a pathway
could be opened</i>

02:33.954 --> 02:36.221
<i>between Heaven, Earth and Hel,</i>

02:36.223 --> 02:40.259
<i>which the Vikings called
Valhalla, Mittgard and Helheim.</i>

02:40.261 --> 02:42.895
<i>The Viking gods
used holy relics as keys</i>

02:42.897 --> 02:46.165
<i>to unlock the gates
to reign over man.</i>

03:01.981 --> 03:05.484
<i>But over time,
the tale faded into myth.</i>

03:05.486 --> 03:07.786
<i>Men abandoned the Viking gods</i>

03:07.788 --> 03:11.823
<i>and embraced the new
Christian god and his son.</i>

03:11.825 --> 03:12.991
<i>Yet one god,</i>

03:12.993 --> 03:15.260
<i>the God of Thunder,</i>

03:15.262 --> 03:16.995
<i>did not forget.</i>

03:16.997 --> 03:19.264
<i>He resolved
to take on human form,</i>

03:19.266 --> 03:20.599
<i>find the keys,</i>

03:20.601 --> 03:22.367
<i>and re-establish
the Viking gods</i>

03:22.369 --> 03:24.303
<i>for all eternity.</i>

03:57.370 --> 03:58.470
Huh?

03:58.472 --> 03:59.838
Row!

04:02.041 --> 04:04.376
Jesus!

04:04.378 --> 04:07.779
Norsemen!

04:07.781 --> 04:11.083
Norsemen!
{screaming}

04:11.085 --> 04:14.586
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

04:14.588 --> 04:17.789
Deum de Deo,
lumen de IÃºmine,

04:17.791 --> 04:20.325
Deum verum de Deo vero,

04:20.327 --> 04:25.063
GÃ©nitum, non factum,
ConsubstantiÃ¡lem Patri,

04:25.065 --> 04:29.534
- Per quem Ã³mnia facta sunt.
- Norseman! Norseman!

04:29.536 --> 04:30.969
The Viking Norseman!

04:32.438 --> 04:33.672
They've come for it.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.441
Close the door!

04:36.443 --> 04:38.043
{yells}

04:38.045 --> 04:40.812
Charge!

05:04.904 --> 05:07.572
{shouts}

05:24.857 --> 05:27.626
None enter the abbey before me.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.094
Aye, My Lord.

06:26.953 --> 06:30.021
God is our sword.
Faith is our shield.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.901
Where is the abbey?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.970
This way, My Lord.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.189
Begone!
This is the house of God!

07:37.191 --> 07:38.523
I am a god!

07:38.525 --> 07:40.959
- Blasphemy!
- Silence!

07:46.566 --> 07:48.567
I am Thor,

07:48.569 --> 07:52.304
son of Odin,
brother of Baldur.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.306
I've come for that
which is not yours,

07:54.308 --> 07:58.176
nor your one god,
nor his son.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.112
The necklace.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.714
It is a holy relic.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.849
Indeed.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.151
It is the necklace
of Mary Magdalene.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.602
You are no god.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.904
You're blood runs
as red as a man's.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.174
Fool.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.576
Even Gods must travel
in the body of flesh,

08:31.578 --> 08:33.578
here in this middle realm.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.982
Was not your own Jesus
pierced and broken?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.126
My Lord, we are ready
to sail with the tide.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.095
Good.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.663
Hmm...

08:51.665 --> 08:55.166
I shall give you
what you truly desire,

08:55.168 --> 08:57.769
closer thee to thy god.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.131
{growls}

10:31.297 --> 10:34.366
{growling}

11:08.034 --> 11:10.101
Forgive me, old friend.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.864
State your business.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.438
My Lord Frey.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.540
There's no need for that,
my friend.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.408
Rise.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.013
God, that stench of bear's
very strong.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.082
Better I stink of his blood
then he of mine.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.084
{chuckles}

11:59.086 --> 12:01.219
Eirick Bloodletter.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.222
High Thane of the Jomsberg.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.458
A huntsman.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.260
I was never fond
of that name.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.897
Most of your kind would kill
to make such a name.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.373
- Skal.
- Skal.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.318
Eirick...

12:33.320 --> 12:36.254
a decade in these woods,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.823
how have you kept your wits?

12:38.825 --> 12:42.293
I would have lost them sooner
had I stayed, My Lord.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.363
And you managed to find
a measure of peace

12:45.365 --> 12:47.565
up here with the bears
and the wolves?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.934
I have.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.936
Then my heart is heavy.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.807
Then lighten it with
what you came here to say.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.580
I bring you news of coming war.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.917
Thor has returned
to the Mittgard

13:05.919 --> 13:09.554
and gathered around him the
Northern Kings of the mortal,

13:09.556 --> 13:11.523
the Trondelag.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.925
There's turmoil in the world.

13:18.864 --> 13:21.399
I was there, Eirick...

13:22.902 --> 13:25.036
at the battle before time,

13:25.038 --> 13:26.538
and I've seen what would
become of this world

13:26.540 --> 13:29.440
if the Jotunn Giants
are set loose again.

13:29.442 --> 13:33.344
I would not see
such things again.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.615
Thor is here

13:37.617 --> 13:40.051
to open the gates
of Valhalla,

13:40.053 --> 13:43.488
Mittgard and Helheim.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.223
You must stop it.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.958
How?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.227
I'm a man.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.429
I am no match for a god.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.598
But you are not just a man.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.900
You are far more.

13:55.902 --> 13:59.470
Ordinary men are not
brought back to life.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.519
My sister gave you
the gift of life

14:14.521 --> 14:17.889
because of her love of you.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.961
For years, you lit her world
with your love.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.662
The ultimate love.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.533
That between a man
and a goddess.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.802
She brought you back

14:30.804 --> 14:34.372
because she could not bare
the world without you.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.975
She never asked for anything
in return.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.576
Eirick?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.698
Freyja.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.701
Live...

15:03.703 --> 15:06.070
my lover.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.041
Live.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.477
Eirick,
you are now an undead.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.580
Only an undead...

15:15.582 --> 15:18.216
can pass through Helheim
and return to Mittgard.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.486
Not even a god,
not even me,

15:21.488 --> 15:23.988
can enter and return,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.490
but you can.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.194
There is in Helheim
a gilded horn.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.097
Now, once blown
in the very face of Thor

15:33.099 --> 15:35.166
will destroy Thor's human flesh

15:35.168 --> 15:39.404
and send him back to the place
of spirits where he belongs.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.208
You can choose to deny me.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.478
You can stay here.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.182
But the pathway will be opened
during the coming Blood Eclipse.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.418
Retrieve the horn,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.420
make your way
to the Henge of Stones,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.555
inside the Fort at Trondheim.

15:57.557 --> 16:02.193
Blow the horn there,
and Thor will be defeated.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.799
What you ask of me
is impossible.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.301
I would have chosen
a weaker man

16:10.303 --> 16:13.538
had it been a simpler task.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.510
Go first to Osberg.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.814
There you will fine a wizard
by the name of Alcuin.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.417
He will lead you
to the gates of Hell.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.020
Wind to your back, Viking.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.991
Clear skies above.

16:44.470 --> 16:50.608
{grunting}

17:15.200 --> 17:17.201
If you're gonna
stand there and watch,

17:17.203 --> 17:20.438
I'd as soon you come here
and give me a hand.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.413
I should've known it was you.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.215
Stink of fucking bear shit
for miles.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.418
So I'm told.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.653
I've got to say
it's good to see you,

17:35.655 --> 17:38.556
so bear shit be damned
'cause you're still my king,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.625
even if you do look
like a hermit.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.260
No longer.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.297
I need your boat.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.699
Well, I knew it wasn't
a courtesy call.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.502
Look to be honest with you,
it's not mine anymore.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.205
It belongs to another.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.407
But I have a feeling
we could work something out.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.477
We'll have to collect it
in Osberg.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.145
Osberg?

18:01.147 --> 18:02.814
That's where I'm headed
and then to Trondeheim.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.316
Well, it's a long way,
so we best get going.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.419
No, Sven. This journey of mine,
it's dangerous.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.621
You have a wife,
family, child-

18:10.623 --> 18:13.858
Yeah, and I'm a Viking
first and foremost,

18:13.860 --> 18:17.562
so give me a moment to collect
my things and bid farewell,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.263
and I'll be back.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.569
You know, it's ten years.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.672
Ten years.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.813
I thought you would've showed
your face here before then.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.748
{laughs}

18:59.438 --> 19:02.907
Hey, my friend, can you
give us a ride to Osberg?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.576
Osberg? Everyone's
going north, not east.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.546
Kings of the Trondelag
are spending silver

19:08.548 --> 19:09.780
like they have
a mine of it.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.884
Wood, iron, warriors.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.986
Anything that can go north
for war, they buy.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.522
What business of you
in Osberg?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.690
None of your fucking business.

19:20.926 --> 19:24.262
Well, can you pay?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.931
Yeah, we can pay you in fur.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.769
If you were virgin girls,
I'd take your fur for pay.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.739
Come on.
Give me a hand here.

19:36.742 --> 19:39.577
{horse whinnies}

19:43.015 --> 19:46.717
Help, help, help.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.352
{knocking}

19:48.354 --> 19:51.322
- Help!
- There's something inside.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.325
Pay no attention to that.
It's just a slave.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.663
What the-

19:58.665 --> 20:02.200
Hah! What manner of man
is collared yellow?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.003
Maybe he's a Laplander
or a dwarf.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.905
Way too ugly to be an elf.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.341
Damn you.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.679
Enough!

20:16.682 --> 20:17.915
Release him.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.550
What?

20:21.019 --> 20:23.621
You heard me. Release him.

20:29.995 --> 20:35.299
- {chatter}
- {festive music}

20:50.415 --> 20:51.949
That's the one.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.541
Welcome to Osberg.

21:17.543 --> 21:21.045
Did you think you could
mess with Ustus and live?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.614
Now put your weapons down,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.750
and you might live
to regret them words.

21:25.752 --> 21:29.720
Smart tongues don't waggle
for long. Kill 'em.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.346
You free me, I repay debt.
We're even.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.686
It's gotta be worth
keeping the wee man.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.421
Will you join us?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.124
Food.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.431
{laughing}

22:50.635 --> 22:52.636
I'm looking for
King Karl Redbeard.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.004
What do you want?

22:54.006 --> 22:56.207
Tell him that Eirick Bloodletter
of the Jomsberg's here

22:56.209 --> 22:58.676
and wishes to seek his counsel.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.811
Alcuin the wizard.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.613
Strange man.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.683
I never really understood
what was in his head.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.986
Well, he's no longer with us,
as you can see.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.857
I'm afraid you've come
a few moons too late,

23:12.859 --> 23:16.227
not that any of us will miss him
very much, I shouldn't think.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.928
What happened?

23:17.930 --> 23:22.500
A group of warriors,
Geat warriors they were,

23:22.502 --> 23:25.169
came to trade,
not many in number.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.706
That was the last
we saw of Alcuin.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.776
The Geats, they've taken him
to Gotland.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.677
Yes, Gotland.

23:33.679 --> 23:37.948
They must've taken him
to their leader Heflar.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.752
From what I understand,
he's not very fond of visitors,

23:41.754 --> 23:43.187
if you know what I mean.

23:43.189 --> 23:48.259
Anyway, if you are sincere
in finding the druid Alcuin,

23:48.261 --> 23:50.728
then you're going to need ships.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.496
We have a ship.

23:52.498 --> 23:55.099
Well, then you're
going to need men.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.802
You're going to have to cut
your way through there.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.071
Yes, here, here.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.240
Thank you, my dear.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.210
A pleasure as always.
{laughs}

24:06.212 --> 24:08.679
Well, anyway,

24:08.681 --> 24:11.549
let me see what I can do to help
you gentlemen out this evening.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.618
In the meantime,
let's drink, shall we?

24:16.221 --> 24:18.088
Ahh!

24:20.659 --> 24:23.661
By the way...

24:23.663 --> 24:25.463
who's your friend?

24:26.765 --> 24:28.132
We found him.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.868
I think he might be an elf.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.803
But he fights like a Valkyrie.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.739
An elf, you say. Well!

24:35.741 --> 24:37.808
A big bastard, isn't he?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.978
Yang Fu Sun.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.683
Yang? Is that your name?

24:47.819 --> 24:50.020
Eirick.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.188
Sven.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.724
Karl.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.960
Eirick.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.129
- Shh-fen.
- That's close enough.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.265
Yang.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.335
Strange little name
for a strange wee man.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.770
Shh-fen.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.880
{crowd cheering}

25:18.183 --> 25:21.986
Friends!

25:22.954 --> 25:25.122
Kinsmen.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.524
Thanes.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.594
Lords.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.596
Good fellows all, eh?

25:32.598 --> 25:34.732
{laughs}

25:34.734 --> 25:36.934
And the rest of you bastards.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.802
{laughter}

25:38.804 --> 25:40.838
Well, we have guests.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.842
Guests of great fame
and grim repute.

25:44.844 --> 25:48.045
Welcome Eirick Bloodletter,

25:48.047 --> 25:51.248
once King of the Jomsbergs.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.652
That same Eirick

25:54.654 --> 25:58.122
who smashed the Danish army
at Jutland!

25:58.124 --> 26:00.758
{murmuring}

26:00.760 --> 26:04.995
Who fought outnumbered
on Zealand.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.897
And...

26:06.899 --> 26:12.403
back to back with his great
friend, Sven Stavanger,

26:12.405 --> 26:15.839
fought from noon until night.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.910
Eirick Bloodletter,

26:19.912 --> 26:23.814
so... beloved...

26:23.816 --> 26:27.384
of the great goddess Freyja,

26:27.386 --> 26:30.387
that when he was
struck down in battle,

26:30.389 --> 26:34.892
he was rised, rised, rised...

26:34.894 --> 26:37.394
by her divine...

26:37.396 --> 26:39.697
intervention.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.104
Come now, brother, come.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.106
Let us see your face, sir.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.710
That face,
that until this night,

26:52.712 --> 26:56.113
we have all known
only by legend.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.949
Sir!

27:03.788 --> 27:05.990
I stand here today

27:05.992 --> 27:10.094
for a god has asked me
to write a song

27:10.096 --> 27:12.329
for people to sing
in years to come.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.132
A somber song it may be.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.936
It requires a journey
to Helheim and back.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.471
Yet we are Vikings

27:20.473 --> 27:24.174
and unafraid of anything
that hell may fling on us.

27:24.176 --> 27:28.479
So any man here who would
be a Viking, come.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.881
Follow me.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.791
Not exactly
an inspirational speech.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.092
It's been a while.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.961
You're telling me.

27:43.963 --> 27:48.298
We're gonna be rowing
our fucking selves to Gotland.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.309
I'm Olaf, son of Redbeard.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.944
Welcome.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.047
And I am Gregor,
also a Redbeard.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.715
Welcome.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.252
Anyone else?

28:27.939 --> 28:29.807
Yomar.

28:29.809 --> 28:33.177
I'm a hunter,
and my bow is yours.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.878
Thank you.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.816
I'm called Henrik.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.453
Will there be any fighting?

28:42.455 --> 28:43.921
There will, lad.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.423
Then I'm with you.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.092
Any chance of gold?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.561
- {laughter}
- Not really.

28:50.563 --> 28:54.798
Well, little enough to be
made here, I suppose.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.433
Can you deal with
an old bugger like me?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.368
We can.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.016
Bernard.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.852
Killer of women and children.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.163
I ask again.

29:27.465 --> 29:30.033
Any more men?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.186
Brynna the Fair.

29:49.188 --> 29:52.489
Daughter of Hildegard,
reader of wind.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.026
This is not a quest for a woman.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.996
{laughter}

29:58.998 --> 30:01.398
Thank you, brothers.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.173
A toast! Toast now!

30:09.175 --> 30:13.177
To honour, to glory,
to a valiant death

30:13.179 --> 30:16.246
and then on to
the hall of heroes. Skal!

30:16.248 --> 30:18.916
Skal!

30:23.388 --> 30:26.056
Please, take one of my ships.

30:26.058 --> 30:30.327
Not this- this bucket.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.396
- Does it float?
- What do you care?

30:32.398 --> 30:34.364
The man promised you
a good death,

30:34.366 --> 30:36.233
and drowning is as good
as any other.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.468
Olaf's right. We should
take his father's longship.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.271
No. In this,
we'll pass unnoticed.

30:41.273 --> 30:44.308
Hopefully leave the same way.

30:56.054 --> 30:59.156
Sven, I told you
that woman was not to come.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.392
- Well, I'm afraid she has to.
- Why?

31:02.394 --> 31:05.395
You remember the conversation
we had about the boat?

31:05.397 --> 31:08.298
Well, that is the new owner.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.502
And captain.
You're crew on my ship.

31:12.504 --> 31:16.440
You'll do as ordered
as any man here will.

31:16.442 --> 31:20.210
If you don't like it,
I hope you swim well.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.499
My Lord, we had
nothing but success.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.369
We've raided
as far south as EspaÃ±a,

31:45.371 --> 31:46.737
across the Angle Sea,

31:46.739 --> 31:50.707
and down their rivers
as far as the village of Paris.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.443
But still no word on
the Horn of Helheim.

31:56.381 --> 32:01.718
Whoever possesses the horn
possesses the power to stop me.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.755
My Lord, I cannot see how.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.624
Our warriors and our ships
are ready.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.027
Christianity lies at our feet.

32:10.029 --> 32:15.299
With you, a god made man,
nothing can stop us.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.503
Even a god can be stopped.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.522
I know you had no choice
to take me.

32:38.524 --> 32:42.526
But I will say this wind
won't abate anytime soon.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.096
What does a woman know
about winds and waves?

32:46.098 --> 32:48.665
As much as anyone whose
mother died in childbirth

32:48.667 --> 32:50.767
and whose father took her
on the longboats.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.438
I have sailed the great seas
to Angle Isle and Greenland

32:54.440 --> 32:58.275
and woven a course
between mountains of ice.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.445
I've been shipwrecked
on the Great Island

33:01.447 --> 33:06.149
and almost died of thirst,
becalmed on the Sea of Sighs.

33:06.151 --> 33:09.319
Perhaps voyaging to Helheim
will be easier than that.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.455
You can still get it wrong.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.391
I say by nightfall,
we'll all be rowing.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.660
And I say we won't.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.822
- {whispering}
- Hmm.

33:45.824 --> 33:50.761
We go to far Gotland,
to the Fjord of Jorgumandr.

33:50.763 --> 33:53.130
Wolfred, get fifty men.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.367
You!
Guard the Henge of Stones.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.436
It has begun.

34:11.516 --> 34:14.650
<i>EIRICK= I can feel
the bad blood.</i>

34:14.652 --> 34:16.686
<i>That's what you get
when there are strangers</i>

34:16.688 --> 34:18.722
<i>sleeping next to you.</i>

34:18.724 --> 34:22.692
<i>I can smell the stench
of a traitor amongst us.</i>

34:43.380 --> 34:45.449
Men are just so full of wind.

34:48.686 --> 34:51.521
Eirick, Eirick.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.862
Land ho, elf eyes.

35:03.801 --> 35:07.170
Gotland. We're here.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.888
This is way too quiet
for my liking.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.224
Stay close.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.814
{scream}

36:24.816 --> 36:27.551
{shouting}

36:53.311 --> 36:54.711
I got one.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.417
Henrik!

38:42.520 --> 38:44.454
To Helheim!

38:59.870 --> 39:02.539
Bloodletter!

39:17.488 --> 39:19.022
Eirick!

39:31.469 --> 39:34.404
The broach is up there.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.518
God, what a jail.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.188
Prison for a wizard
of the earth.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.791
No contact with the ground.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.726
Are you Alcuin?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.931
Heflar of the Geats
was many things.

40:01.933 --> 40:05.034
None of them virtuous,
most of them cunning.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.103
I have you to thank
for his death,

40:07.105 --> 40:10.206
Thane of Jomsberg.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.175
You know of me, wizard?

40:13.944 --> 40:17.947
I saw the possibility
of your arrival.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.183
Will you let me down?

40:20.185 --> 40:24.888
If you promise to take me
to the gates of Helheim.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.691
Any man may find those gates.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.927
Most eventually do.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.629
I plan on returning.

40:32.631 --> 40:36.199
None who cross that bridge
may ever return,

40:36.201 --> 40:38.234
Thane of Jomsberg.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.670
The dead know me
as one of their own.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.610
Ah!

40:47.612 --> 40:51.047
Freyja's mortal lover.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.817
I heard tell,
but did not believe.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.587
I hear many things
from many voices,

40:57.589 --> 41:00.056
Eirick Bloodletter.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.759
Will you help me?

41:02.761 --> 41:05.195
I'll show you the way.

41:05.197 --> 41:08.765
Close it is to any man's heart
that truly seeks it.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.739
Lower me, please.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.676
Please.
Please let me down.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.979
Soldiers come from the north.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.714
Many horses.

41:57.716 --> 42:01.551
You have powerful enemies,
Thane Eirick.

42:07.958 --> 42:11.261
Come, wizard.
Time is against us.

43:40.818 --> 43:42.051
A wizard was kept there, sire.

43:42.053 --> 43:44.787
It was as you said=
an iron cage, no roof.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.789
Good.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.392
Now we shall see
if he's all you think he is.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.994
Who is this wretch?

43:53.097 --> 43:57.166
My- My Lord...

43:57.168 --> 43:59.202
raider ship...

43:59.204 --> 44:01.170
killed our men,

44:01.172 --> 44:06.809
killed our great King Heflar,

44:06.811 --> 44:09.445
took the druid.

44:09.447 --> 44:11.748
Who took the druid?

44:11.750 --> 44:16.719
I heard the druid
call him by his name,

44:16.721 --> 44:20.390
Eirick,
Thane of Jomsberg.

44:20.392 --> 44:24.327
Heflar called him...

44:24.329 --> 44:26.095
Bloodletter.

44:26.097 --> 44:30.233
Eirick Bloodletter.
A fine name.

44:30.235 --> 44:31.934
You know him, sire?

44:31.936 --> 44:34.270
We return to Trondheim.
It is done.

44:34.272 --> 44:37.240
My Lord, surely we should
pursue them.

44:37.242 --> 44:39.375
No.

44:39.377 --> 44:42.378
He will come for me.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.350
How much further?

44:47.352 --> 44:49.118
Oh, not far now.

44:52.890 --> 44:56.392
In Helheim, there are many
things you must beware of,

44:56.394 --> 44:59.762
but one thing
you cannot avoid.

44:59.764 --> 45:03.032
At the gate of Helheim
lies a massive hound,

45:03.034 --> 45:05.268
a hound called Garm.

45:05.270 --> 45:08.171
He has no eyes, but he can
smell out the living

45:08.173 --> 45:10.239
and the dead.

45:10.241 --> 45:12.408
You may not escape.

45:19.516 --> 45:21.818
It is there!

45:26.457 --> 45:28.124
How do I reach it?

45:28.126 --> 45:29.992
Swim far and deep.

45:29.994 --> 45:32.929
Follow the current
as it gets colder and colder,

45:32.931 --> 45:34.464
to the very depths.

45:34.466 --> 45:38.000
There you will see the gates.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.103
Eirick, you sure about this?
It's madness.

45:40.105 --> 45:42.105
Aye! Madness it is.

45:42.107 --> 45:44.173
All bravery is.

45:45.342 --> 45:47.410
You're gonna need tallow.

46:01.058 --> 46:02.892
Are you scared?

46:04.595 --> 46:06.195
Terrified.

46:06.197 --> 46:07.530
You should be.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.602
I don't know if you're
the bravest man I've ever met

46:12.604 --> 46:14.871
or the biggest fool.

46:21.111 --> 46:24.247
If I don't return by sunup,
go home.

46:24.249 --> 46:26.315
You just make sure
you come back.

46:27.251 --> 46:28.551
Eirick go?

46:28.553 --> 46:29.886
Eirick go.

46:29.888 --> 46:31.087
Yang no go?

46:31.089 --> 46:32.522
Yang no go.

46:33.991 --> 46:36.626
Full wind with you,
my friend.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.961
Clear skies above.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.599
<i>ALCUIN= Swim far and deep.</i>

47:16.601 --> 47:19.502
<i>Follow the current
as it gets colder and colder,</i>

47:19.504 --> 47:21.170
<i>to the very depths.</i>

47:21.172 --> 47:23.306
<i>There you will see the gates.</i>

47:35.519 --> 47:41.557
{gasping}

48:32.142 --> 48:36.612
{low growling}

49:44.214 --> 49:47.183
{screaming}

50:20.117 --> 50:21.784
Father.

50:23.420 --> 50:26.355
Of all the torment
in this place,

50:26.357 --> 50:30.526
none has caused me more pain
than seeing you here.

50:30.528 --> 50:33.329
I always believed you'd stand
at the right hand of Odin.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.767
I was a picture of a king.

50:37.769 --> 50:39.769
A coward of worst kind.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.339
Too afraid to live.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.876
The door of Heaven
never opened for me.

50:46.878 --> 50:50.679
Here I've been,
here I shall stand.

50:52.182 --> 50:54.283
How did you know I was here?

50:54.285 --> 50:56.819
A whisper in my ear.

50:58.455 --> 51:01.891
This is a place for torment.

51:01.893 --> 51:05.428
A settling of account.

51:05.430 --> 51:09.231
Eirick, you are not my son.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.734
Lies.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.869
We are the dead!

51:13.871 --> 51:16.172
Lies offer no comfort here.

51:16.174 --> 51:19.508
Truly you're not my son.

51:19.510 --> 51:21.544
Your mother never knew.

51:21.546 --> 51:24.480
He came, had my face,
my image,

51:24.482 --> 51:27.249
and she was deceived.

51:29.319 --> 51:32.521
You are my father,
whether you seeded me or not.

51:34.858 --> 51:37.460
Why are you here?!

51:37.462 --> 51:39.428
I seek the Horn of Helheim.

51:39.430 --> 51:42.598
And then?!

51:42.600 --> 51:44.700
Then I will return.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.236
No, my son.

51:47.238 --> 51:50.439
You will remain here
among the dead forever.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.342
Not without a fight.

51:53.344 --> 51:57.480
That's the difference between
the living and the dead.

51:57.482 --> 51:59.482
Hope.

52:00.517 --> 52:02.852
Will you help me find it?

52:02.854 --> 52:04.653
Hmm...

52:08.425 --> 52:11.494
You will find the horn
within the Gate of Souls.

52:14.931 --> 52:20.202
{moaning}

52:22.239 --> 52:27.610
{moaning continues}

52:55.705 --> 52:57.673
Alive.

53:03.980 --> 53:06.649
Stay with us.

53:11.488 --> 53:12.588
Forever.

53:25.001 --> 53:26.035
Father, now!

53:26.037 --> 53:29.405
{yelling}

53:29.407 --> 53:31.373
Damn you!

53:31.375 --> 53:34.210
{yells}
You will not have him!

53:46.323 --> 53:49.024
Maybe we should go.

53:49.026 --> 53:52.294
What need have we with Helheim?

53:52.296 --> 53:56.065
He said it himself. If he
doesn't return by sunrise-

53:56.067 --> 53:58.300
Yeah, I know what he said.

53:58.302 --> 54:00.469
But the ship stays on course,
and so do you.

54:00.471 --> 54:04.273
I say we leave!
Who's with me?

54:05.842 --> 54:08.844
He's been in there
the whole night.

54:08.846 --> 54:10.646
He's probably dead by now.

54:10.648 --> 54:13.082
How many more of us
do you want killed?

54:13.084 --> 54:14.617
Coward.

54:14.619 --> 54:17.653
Where is your honour?

54:17.655 --> 54:21.523
You're a killer of women
and children.

54:21.525 --> 54:24.860
What do you know of honour?

54:24.862 --> 54:28.297
All my life, I was a farmer.

54:30.033 --> 54:33.936
But then the raiders came.

54:33.938 --> 54:38.340
Blood of these same Geat cowards
we killed yesterday.

54:39.676 --> 54:42.077
Burned down my farm,

54:42.079 --> 54:44.947
my father's home,

54:44.949 --> 54:49.018
killed my wife
and my children.

54:51.655 --> 54:53.589
Carved me hollow,

54:53.591 --> 54:56.458
left me blank,

54:56.460 --> 54:59.528
so the only thing I crave
is the death I deserve.

55:02.399 --> 55:05.401
So I killed those raiders.

55:05.403 --> 55:08.103
I killed them all.

55:08.105 --> 55:11.740
I killed their wives.

55:11.742 --> 55:13.909
I killed their children.

55:13.911 --> 55:17.613
Burned their homes
and their ships.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.782
And I listen to their screams

55:19.784 --> 55:23.419
as they watched their seed
wiped from the middle kingdom.

55:29.392 --> 55:32.494
They meant to take
all that I had,

55:32.496 --> 55:36.498
but there could not
take my honour.

55:36.500 --> 55:40.469
And I'd rather die with honour
than to live a coward.

55:40.471 --> 55:44.106
That's a man spoken
like a true Viking.

55:45.975 --> 55:47.209
We wait.

55:47.211 --> 55:50.145
Wait. Look out for Garm,
the Hound of Helheim.

55:50.147 --> 55:51.947
He is the gatekeeper.

55:51.949 --> 55:55.150
I past it before.
He let me through.

55:55.152 --> 55:59.021
Just because he lets you in
doesn't mean he'll let you out.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.067
{growling}

56:12.069 --> 56:13.736
Run!

56:13.738 --> 56:14.970
{growls}

56:39.929 --> 56:43.165
We can't outrun him.
He can smell your blood.

56:44.734 --> 56:46.168
Turn around.

56:47.170 --> 56:48.437
Turn around, boy!

56:54.177 --> 56:56.612
Think well me, always.

57:00.016 --> 57:01.950
I am here!

57:01.952 --> 57:03.886
Raahh!

57:41.758 --> 57:43.692
Think well of me, son.

57:44.794 --> 57:45.994
Always.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.702
Things aren't always
as they seem, my love.

57:55.138 --> 57:58.607
You must blow the horn
in the face of Thor to stop him.

58:03.279 --> 58:04.646
{gasps}

58:06.816 --> 58:08.884
{horn blowing}

58:08.886 --> 58:10.052
Brynna, wake up.

58:13.089 --> 58:15.057
He's there!

58:27.270 --> 58:28.270
- Eirick.
- Brother.

58:28.272 --> 58:29.938
- Eirick. Brother
- Eirick.

58:29.940 --> 58:32.174
- Eirick.
- Eirick.

58:33.109 --> 58:35.210
- Eirick.
- Huh?

58:45.355 --> 58:47.623
So you're back.

58:51.327 --> 58:53.729
Are you gonna be all right?

58:58.735 --> 59:01.203
Eirick, sit down
and drink this.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.278
I saw my father.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.680
No, you never.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.850
What you saw was some type
of spirit made in his image.

59:14.852 --> 59:17.152
No. It was him.

59:17.154 --> 59:19.221
He told me I wasn't his son.

59:19.223 --> 59:21.223
Well, that can't be true,
can it?

59:21.225 --> 59:23.125
I grew up with you,

59:23.127 --> 59:24.793
and I know your face,
and I know his,

59:24.795 --> 59:27.062
and he is your father
for sure.

59:27.064 --> 59:31.667
It makes no sense.
It makes no sense.

59:31.669 --> 59:35.938
But you got what you went for.

59:35.940 --> 59:38.106
You did it.

59:39.943 --> 59:42.978
If only I knew
what she gave me

59:42.980 --> 59:46.081
when she gave me
the gift of life,

59:46.083 --> 59:50.218
I would've lived, Sven.
I swear I would've lived.

59:50.220 --> 59:53.889
Yeah, but it's
not over yet, is it?

59:53.891 --> 59:54.990
No.

59:54.992 --> 59:57.993
So let me say something.

59:57.995 --> 01:00:02.898
Something I should've said
a long, long time ago.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.267
I've never met a man
so brave

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.803
and so afraid to be
what he actually is.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.638
Eirick, listen to me.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.909
You are a great man.

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:18.447
You were born to lead men,
to inspire men.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:21.183
But ever since I've known you,
all you've ever done

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:24.119
is try and prove that you're
just like everybody else,

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.722
but you're not.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:32.427
I am pleased to see you,
My Lord.

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.463
I doubted you would return,

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:38.700
and I did my best to turn aside
the crew and sail for home,

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.335
My Lord.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:43.905
Warick, you seem so frightened.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.875
Often the most cautious
are the most wise.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:47.976
Warick the Wise.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.013
There's a fine name
for a Viking.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.180
Welcome back.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.953
Did you decide?

01:00:57.955 --> 01:00:58.987
What?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.390
Am I brave or a fool?

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:02.824
Both.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:14.002
I have to blow this horn
in the face of Thor.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.772
Tell me what I should do.

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:20.809
He will be at Trondheim
at the Henge of Stones.

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:21.877
For the Blood Eclipse?

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.513
Yes, but you will have

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:28.116
the gathered armies
of the Trondelag to face.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.519
We have an army.

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:33.155
It's been a very long time.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.890
Mm.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:37.426
You think your brother's
gonna be glad to see you?

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.161
No.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.263
<i>EIRICK= So Eirick
the Bloodletter</i>

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:44.232
<i>has became Eirick
the Harrower of Hell.</i>

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.035
<i>But my story is far from over.</i>

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:50.305
<i>I now have to make a journey
to the place I dread most.</i>

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.773
<i>Home.</i>

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:55.210
<i>With the horn and protection
of Lord Frey and Frejya,</i>

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.012
<i>I believe all would be well,</i>

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:59.281
<i>and the Jomsberg would
fight with me once more.</i>

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.383
<i>But nothing prepared me
for the biggest betrayal</i>

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.819
<i>that is yet to come.</i>

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:14.796
Sven, drop the anchor.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.403
Look! Jomsberg!

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.282
This doesn't feel right.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.384
Not all of us should go.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.421
I'll stay behind,
if it pleases you.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.423
Perhaps you'll keep Yang.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.191
He's a prize to men
who keep slaves.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:45.827
That will be safe with me.

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.199
Yang no go?

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.336
Good.

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:56.538
Brynna, you stay behind.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.807
Keep in eye on Alcuin.

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:05.013
State your business. This is
the fortress of Jomsberg.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.915
We suffer no visitors.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:08.517
You suffer no visitors?

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:10.285
What if that visitor
pulled your unconscious body

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.921
out of the Sea of Zealand?

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:15.624
Eirick? Is that you?

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.225
It is.

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.628
Welcome home, My Lord.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.531
Good to see you, old friend.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.499
Hardly a moon goes by
when our swords

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:28.103
don't wet the ground with
some poor bastard's claret.

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:30.438
We only fight for gold now.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.041
Not like the old days.

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:34.976
No more rushing off
for desperate battles

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.578
with terrible odds.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.480
No more raids.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.315
What would your father say,

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:43.985
the Jomsberg, mercenaries
to the highest bidder?

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:13.081
I'll not be questioned by you
in this hall again, Jorgen!

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.250
If you don't like it,

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.385
then give back
your share and go!

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:22.090
My Lord Beothric
and great captains of Jomsberg,

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:26.194
I present Eirick,
son of Alfred.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:35.303
Let my brother step forward.

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.043
Beothric.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.980
- Brother.
- Eirick.

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:48.683
I never thought I'd see you
in this hall again.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:51.319
I never thought to come.

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:55.123
But now that I have...

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.524
it feels good.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:59.327
But I have to say

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.463
your hospitality leaves
a little bit to be desired.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:04.165
You've not offered us
even a sip of water,

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.167
let alone a drop
of the hard stuff.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:10.739
We drink mead in this hall
to celebrate and to mourn.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:14.309
Your being here
is cause for neither.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:18.346
We were warned you'd come.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:21.583
Come here to take back
the throne of our father?

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.385
Brother, no.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:27.255
But then,
look around you, brother.

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:32.460
See the poor trappings
of our father's era?

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:38.066
No. No, you do not.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:44.005
20,000 gold coins I'm paid
by the Byzantine emperor

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.508
for a squadron
of our warriors.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:52.247
Arthur of the Angles
pays me 30,000 in silver

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:56.117
so that I may keep
his throne safe.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:06:00.055
For I, the younger
and lesser brother

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.390
sits on this throne,

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.592
and our kingdom is rich.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.495
And now you come.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.297
You're mistaken, brother.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.132
I did not return
for the crown.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.701
Instead I've been
asked by the gods

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:15.370
to take on a battle
with impossible odds.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:17.672
- With whom?
- The god Thor.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:20.241
Thor?

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.546
Just because he came back
from the dead,

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:28.249
he thinks he can take on
the God of Thunder?

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.186
I came here to ask
for your help,

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.754
not to be mocked.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:33.989
Let's go.

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:38.293
No, brother, I cannot
allow you to leave.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:43.631
A listening ear
for all who despise my reign,

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:47.502
a figurehead for those
who would overthrow me?

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.237
Forgive me, brother.

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:51.940
Take them away!

01:06:51.942 --> 01:06:56.411
Search them and bring
whatever you find to me.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:05.120
I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:08.089
Why don't you just give
Lord Beothric what he wants?

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:10.692
Then we don't have to do this.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.758
Someone's approaching,
and it's not one of us.

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:58.273
You are friends
of My Lord Eirick?

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:01.409
We are.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.913
Then know this=
He has been betrayed.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:07.215
He and his fellows
are in the dungeon.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:09.584
I might get you
into the keep,

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:13.555
but by oath, I cannot raise
a sword against my brothers.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:18.359
But you might get him out,
get him back to the boat.

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.562
Eirick needs us.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:23.264
- Eirick need Yang?
- Yes.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.899
These Jomsberg
are no brawlers, my lass.

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.602
They're the finest warriors
on earth.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.839
Good. Arrogant men fall easiest.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:50.825
We'll not pass
that courtyard unseen.

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:54.229
I wouldn't be so glum,
good Yorik.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.743
Alcuin, hurry up.

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:12.212
Go! I will join you
in due time.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:24.559
{muttering}

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.232
{muttering}

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:48.983
This leads
straight to the dungeons.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:51.252
Your friends are down there.

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:17.979
The king is sending us north
with a slave for barter.

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.750
{chatter}

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.819
- Do you hear that?
- Shh!

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.769
Brynna! Good?

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:50.672
Yes, Yang, I'm fine. You?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:53.608
I'm fine. Come.

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.864
- Open the gate.
- Fuck you, whore!

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.502
Open the door.
Open the door!

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.471
Whatever you say, my lady.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.111
Hey, it's the little man.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:31.846
Yang good?

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.047
No, Yang,
you're fucking brilliant.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:34.048
Where's Eirick?

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.783
Next cell.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:53.835
Oh...

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:13.654
By Odin's blind eye,
what have they done to you?

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.965
Brynna, where's the horn?

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:25.733
With Alcuin.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.469
Where is he?

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.531
The druid and the horn,
where are they?

01:13:56.533 --> 01:13:58.499
Cut them down.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:01.669
I'd stay still if I were you,
My Lord.

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:03.838
See how he betrays
his brother?

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.908
May he not treat you the same.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.478
What did Thor offer you
to betray me?

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:18.553
Why, all of the Angle Isles
to rule as I see fit.

01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:20.254
You see, brother,

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:22.790
you're not the only one
with the counsel of the gods.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.760
You can keep your Angle Isles
and the throne.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.728
But understand this.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.199
When I have subdued Thor,
I will come back for you,

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:33.201
and we will have
our reckoning.

01:14:33.203 --> 01:14:37.972
It is you who does not
understand, brother.

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:42.777
The horn itself
commands the highest price.

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:45.713
Without it, you're worthless.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:48.049
King of Jomsberg!

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.552
Would this be what you seek?

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.088
You bastard! Traitor!

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:58.659
My, my.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.529
This is a fine thing.

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:07.268
You see, brother,
the message was very simple.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.070
Your brother's coming,

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:12.773
and he carries
the Horn of Helheim.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:16.077
Retrieve it and capture him.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:20.114
And with the help
of your friend here, I have.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:26.687
So now it's time
for my reckoning with you.

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.357
Take him away.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:32.560
Treat him as befits a royal.
Use a sword.

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.731
Throw the rest of a cliff.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:42.169
Druid, come.
Drink with me.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.705
I thought there was
a traitor amongst us.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.940
It's Alcuin the wizard.

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:49.777
He owes us his life.
How could he do that?

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:52.680
In return for Beothric's gold.

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.691
My Lord, we are with you.

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.826
We will take you away from
this place and give you shelter.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.328
We will also gather
our group of men

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.896
to join you
to fight the Trondelag.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.665
What about the other captains?

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.199
For them, it's treason.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.139
That looks like it hurts.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:55.610
Let me.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.950
If this quest goes on
too much longer,

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.052
there won't be
much of you left.

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.022
We've lost the horn.

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:10.424
The odds are against us.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:14.228
Could we not fight
without it?

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:17.832
The horn is the only thing
that can stop Thor.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:21.636
Maybe I have no right
to ask the men to go on.

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:24.739
Or you.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:32.747
I know you said you would ask
no more of me than any man,

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:35.483
but what if I wanted
to give you...

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:37.985
what only a woman can?

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.926
Brynna...

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:50.031
I promised my heart to another
many years ago.

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.243
I wondered how I ever loved
such a human fool.

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:03.244
Freyja?

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.413
No.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.482
Be still there.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:11.185
Don't turn around.

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:16.223
We are far from one another
right now,

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:19.026
but through this
I can speak.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:33.374
I barter myself with the gods...

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:36.277
so that you might live again.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:41.916
But your life
came with a condition,

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:46.220
that you and I...

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.522
can never experience
love again.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:52.393
But at least you lived.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:56.797
I'd rather be dead
than live my life without you.

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.499
You must.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.453
I brought you back...

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:23.357
so that you should live.

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:26.026
We can no longer be.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:28.562
Eirick...

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.298
stop living in memories.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.902
If a man spends his life
looking backwards,

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.938
he'll miss what's
right in front of him.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.375
And what is
right in front of me?

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.110
Hope.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.047
A chance for joy,

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:49.350
happiness.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.952
A chance for the one thing

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:56.924
that mortals have
that the gods desire=

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:59.360
love.

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:01.428
It's no shame to love again.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.901
For what little time is left,
Thor has-

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:09.904
Then fight for
your right to tomorrow.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:11.972
Fight...

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.509
so that your name
is whistled down the ages

01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:17.978
as a name for goodness,

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.314
for worth,

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.183
and for light.

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:45.539
I'm- I'm sorry.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.009
I- I didn't mean to.

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.946
If you take me, I'm yours.

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:56.317
I'll think about it,
My Lord.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:43.464
I know that look
on a man's face.

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:45.199
Amazing what
a good night's sleep can do.

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.468
More like a night
not sleeping.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.536
There's your army, My Lord.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.988
You do your men
and Jomsberg proud.

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:10.190
This will be a great battle.

01:22:10.192 --> 01:22:12.493
They'll sing songs about
the few that went to Trondheim

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:15.696
and smashed
the armies of the god.

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:19.199
Men, we leave soon,
before Beothric finds out!

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:31.478
Forgive us, sire.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.048
We have traitors in our midst.

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:40.287
Some of our brothers have
sided with your brother, sire.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.972
The king is dead.

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.242
The druid.

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:16.390
What are they to do
with only a few hundred men?

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:18.759
They are the Jomsberg.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:22.096
Who knows what they'll do?

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:24.298
I care little.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.799
Tomorrow I shall have
the horn,

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:27.401
and no army
in this middle kingdom

01:23:27.403 --> 01:23:28.869
will be able to stop me.

01:23:28.871 --> 01:23:34.375
The Gates of Valhalla, Mittgard
and Helheim will swing wide.

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:38.679
My Lord, what is this plan?

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:39.813
What are you saying?

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:41.682
I shall open the pathway...

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:44.385
to open the gates
of Heaven and Hell.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:46.453
It will wreak havoc
upon our world.

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:52.459
I care little for your world.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.264
Thousands of our people
will die.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:24:01.468
These people fell our fields,
build our ships.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:04.338
Surely you cannot be unaware of
the havoc that this will cause.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.740
Fool! Of course I am aware.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:09.877
Only by my forging mayhem
upon the world

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:14.314
can the Christian god
be destroyed forever.

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:16.850
This is not about
our Viking quests

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:19.153
or extending our realm.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:22.689
It's about you and the gods
at the expense of mortals.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:26.527
What care have I for mortals?
I am a god.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:28.429
You may care little, My Lord,

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:32.366
but I'll not you lead us
into our own destruction!

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.655
You forgot one thing.

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:01.462
Only those
with the blood of gods

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:03.497
can use the weapons
of the gods.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:08.669
You, Wolfred...

01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:11.705
suffer from a lack of vision.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:14.274
Kings of the North,
prepare your men.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:17.344
The battle for the middle
kingdom starts at sunrise.

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.347
Captain.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:27.588
I name you King of Nordland,
in place of Wolfred.

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.738
{pants}
So many.

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.008
Your men probe the shield wall
right to left

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.877
and throw our full weight
on the left flank

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.745
once the wall has broke.

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:00.614
- And if we break it?
- Then we push through.

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.783
And if Thor shows up
before then?

01:27:02.785 --> 01:27:06.320
I'll shall call him out,
and we'll fight to the death.

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.828
The eclipse.

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.897
It will begin soon.

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:21.301
Men, we camp here
for the night.

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:49.363
Men of Jomsberg,
Vikings, brothers...

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.066
across the ridge
is the army of the north,

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.102
more than a thousand strong.

01:27:55.104 --> 01:27:58.538
We are but a few.
Five to one.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.541
If you wish,
I'll ride to their captains

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:05.712
and ask for an extra day
so they can gather more men.

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:08.749
It only seems fair.

01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:11.451
Some of you know me.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.887
Some of you have bled with me.

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:20.927
Some of you have heard
tall tales of battles won,

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:24.564
of gods and goddesses.

01:28:24.566 --> 01:28:26.967
This is me,
Eirick of Jomsberg,

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:29.036
and my song is
not yet finished.

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:34.608
The measure of a man is not
measured in his battles won,

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:37.511
the dead by his swords,
or the gold he has stored away.

01:28:37.513 --> 01:28:39.913
A man is measured
by his courage,

01:28:39.915 --> 01:28:41.915
his devotion to family,

01:28:41.917 --> 01:28:44.484
his willingness
to grab his destiny.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:45.852
If we do not fight this day,

01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:47.654
there will be
a generation of terror,

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:52.059
and the gods will unleash
horrors of the old age.

01:28:52.061 --> 01:28:55.529
Today you do not
fight for yourself.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:58.598
Today...

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.805
you fight for your wives,
your sons, your daughters.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:07.874
If you should die this day,

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:10.811
die with the faith that you
have stood shield to shield

01:29:10.813 --> 01:29:13.680
with your brothers.

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:16.083
And die as a Viking should,

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:18.085
with honour.

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.821
Come.

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.426
Follow me!

01:29:26.428 --> 01:29:29.129
{cheering}

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.602
Now that's more like it.

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.877
{man shouting commands}

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.883
They don't stand a chance
against our mighty army.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:51.485
Take position!

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.821
To the wall!

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:58.725
{rumbling}

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:00.727
{shouting}

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:09.836
Fire!

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:11.571
Take cover!

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:19.780
First wave, form a new line!

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:41.501
Retreat!

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:17.597
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.496
We've broken down the wall,
Captain,

01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:31.464
but we've lost many of our men.

01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:35.101
We have to win this.
We'll fight to the very end.

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:36.970
{shouting}

01:34:36.972 --> 01:34:38.772
Another captain comes!

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.323
My Lord, your brother is dead.

01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:00.427
We pledge ourselves to you
in your noble cause.

01:35:00.429 --> 01:35:03.430
Come, let us join the fight.

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.502
- Sire.
- Speak, man.

01:35:09.504 --> 01:35:12.305
They've broken to the left.
They've reinforced.

01:35:12.307 --> 01:35:13.940
Let's ride.

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.326
Gregor!

01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:03.957
- We're broken.
- Who will tell Thor?

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:05.558
To hell with him.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.962
I ride to my ships and beyond.
Stay if you wish.

01:36:08.964 --> 01:36:11.431
- Save yourself if you can.
- You're not Vikings.

01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:14.834
To hell with you, too,
King of Nordland.

01:36:14.836 --> 01:36:16.469
Back to the fortress!

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.072
Retreat! Retreat!

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:21.868
- There's none left for us.
- Fine with me.

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:26.940
I didn't come here
to be a casual observer.

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:59.172
I won't let you do it.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.548
So...

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.183
what now, Eirick?

01:38:10.185 --> 01:38:12.352
You cannot stop me.

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:16.956
Did you come just to see me
open the Gates of Helheim?

01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:20.360
I may not have the horn,
but do you see me running?

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:24.964
I've come to face you, Thor,
and die if I must.

01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:26.499
Ah, yes.

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.269
The horn.

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:34.274
By blowing this here,

01:38:34.276 --> 01:38:36.643
you thought to send me
back to Valhalla.

01:38:36.645 --> 01:38:38.578
I will try.

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:43.049
You cannot stand against me,
my son.

01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:45.418
{thunderclap}

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:50.290
Your father did not know
the truth.

01:38:50.292 --> 01:38:54.260
He took after his form
to lay with your mother.

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:56.663
I did not need such artifices.

01:38:56.665 --> 01:39:00.033
She was a willing whore
to my desires.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.770
Did you truly believe

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:06.639
a mortal man could
rise from the dead,

01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:09.509
could drink from a cup
of Frey without dying?

01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:11.644
Could lay with
the Goddess of Love

01:39:11.646 --> 01:39:14.480
without being driven insane
by desire?

01:39:14.482 --> 01:39:17.717
The blood of the gods
is in your veins.

01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:21.087
My blood is in your veins.

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:24.057
Yield to me

01:39:24.059 --> 01:39:28.027
and together we shall rule
the world with our fist,

01:39:28.029 --> 01:39:30.430
and we shall drive
the one god and his son

01:39:30.432 --> 01:39:32.398
from the face of the earth.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:35.802
I will not let you destroy
the middle kingdom.

01:39:35.804 --> 01:39:37.236
Then fight.

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:23.383
{whips crack}

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:16.295
No! Eirick!

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:04.577
Your weapon
holds no fear for me!

01:43:04.579 --> 01:43:06.913
I have the blood
of the gods in me.

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.949
I have the blood of the gods.

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:36.842
{horn blows}

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:06.872
May I have
the Horn of Helheim?

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.911
Lord Frey.

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:19.018
Poor Thane of Jomsberg.

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:26.058
You can blow this
until the sea freeze is over,

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.328
but it was never meant
to blow Thor away.

01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:32.398
No, it was meant
for another...

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.500
higher purpose.

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:37.770
- But you said-
- Yes.

01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:42.808
I told you only an undead
could enter Hell.

01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:44.644
Being gods,

01:44:44.646 --> 01:44:49.548
both Thor and I needed you
to obtain this horn.

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:51.350
You see,
three relics are needed

01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:54.453
to open the gates of Heaven,
Earth and Hell.

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:59.825
The necklace of Mary Magdalene
from Mittgard,

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:04.597
the Hammer of Thor
from Valhalla,

01:45:04.599 --> 01:45:07.667
and the Gilded Horn
of Helheim.

01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:09.535
You poor fool.

01:45:09.537 --> 01:45:13.039
The horn is the final key,

01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:15.474
and you've brought it to us.

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:18.577
Why are you doing this?

01:45:18.579 --> 01:45:21.947
Men... are ungrateful.

01:45:21.949 --> 01:45:23.949
We have protected you for ages,

01:45:23.951 --> 01:45:27.420
then you abandon us
for some new god?

01:45:27.422 --> 01:45:31.590
It is time for man
to pay the price.

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.865
My son...

01:45:39.867 --> 01:45:42.635
together we could have
ruled the world.

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:17.670
{screaming}

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:20.806
FREY= The horn's breaking!

01:46:20.808 --> 01:46:22.775
Something's wrong.

01:46:34.087 --> 01:46:36.489
Why is this happening?

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.759
Because it's a fake!

01:46:39.761 --> 01:46:43.529
I gave a false horn
to Beothric!

01:46:43.531 --> 01:46:45.631
I listened to what
the earth told me!

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:03.682
ALCUIN= I knew your plans, Frey.

01:47:03.684 --> 01:47:06.619
And I learned
you would betray us.

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:16.195
Nature will always tell
the story of a traitor.

01:47:16.197 --> 01:47:17.663
No one-

01:47:17.665 --> 01:47:19.932
god or mortal-

01:47:19.934 --> 01:47:21.867
should rule the earth!

01:47:21.869 --> 01:47:26.071
{screaming}

01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:31.577
{screaming}

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:42.455
{screaming}

01:48:07.047 --> 01:48:08.747
Brynna.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.321
It's a good death.

01:48:15.323 --> 01:48:18.324
It should've been me.

01:48:18.326 --> 01:48:21.594
No one chooses their fate.

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:29.602
You're not responsible
for my life

01:48:29.604 --> 01:48:32.004
or anyone else's.

01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:33.939
Only your own.

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:37.743
{groans}

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:39.912
I'm at peace.

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:46.051
I have a glorious death.

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:51.824
Send me back to sea.

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.160
Behold, Brynna the Fair.

01:49:28.162 --> 01:49:31.297
You see your mother
awaiting you in paradise?

01:49:31.299 --> 01:49:33.399
Behold, Gregor the Formidable.

01:49:33.401 --> 01:49:35.301
Do you see our kinsmen?

01:49:35.303 --> 01:49:37.269
Behold, Warick the Wise.

01:49:37.271 --> 01:49:39.405
Do you see your rest
awaiting you in paradise?

01:49:39.407 --> 01:49:41.774
Behold, Bernard the Viking.

01:49:41.776 --> 01:49:45.244
His paradise is his honour
and family.

01:49:49.182 --> 01:49:50.416
And there I see my friends

01:49:50.418 --> 01:49:52.885
surrounded by those
who have gone before.

01:49:52.887 --> 01:49:58.057
For when my time comes,
I shall join them there gladly.

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.363
<i>ERICK= Such marks the passing</i>

01:50:04.365 --> 01:50:07.066
<i>of the old gods
from middle kingdom.</i>

01:50:07.068 --> 01:50:10.169
<i>Mankind is now free
to choose their gods,</i>

01:50:10.171 --> 01:50:12.671
<i>their friends,
their enemies.</i>

01:50:12.673 --> 01:50:14.974
<i>I became known as
Eirick Thorson.</i>

01:50:14.976 --> 01:50:18.744
<i>My men and I have become the
guardians of the holy relics.</i>

01:50:18.746 --> 01:50:23.349
<i>Not many know of our existence,
so our song...</i>

01:50:23.351 --> 01:50:26.018
<i>our song is not yet sung.</i>
