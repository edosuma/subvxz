02:22.520 --> 02:25.410
There he is.
That's what I want to see, baby.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.562
- You ready?
- Bring people. I'll dance.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.246
<i>- I need you on your A game.
- I'll bring the show.</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:32.926
But one second.
Could we just...? Time-out.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.242
- Just get a crowd, man. All right?
- Yes.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.085
- Yo, Donny. First bus of the day.
- All right.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.130
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
please come this way.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.251
Step this way. Please come closer.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.803
I got something special for y'all
and his name is Donny Bray.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.088
- Hey.
- What he does with his feet...

02:51.240 --> 02:53.720
has never been seen
on Bourbon Street.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.407
He's going to show you
the real New Orleans.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.211
I think they're ready, let's go.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.604
I taught him everything he knows.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.248
Hey. Nice catch.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.165
Come on, come on.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.046
<i>Hey-</i>

04:04.480 --> 04:07.086
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.161
All right. All right, let's go.
Shaw's over.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.005
That's it. Shaw's over.
Move it on. Let's go.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.810
<i>Hey-</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:19.524
What's wrong? What did I do?

04:19.680 --> 04:22.490
You're not supposed to be
within 100 feet of a bar...

04:22.640 --> 04:25.962
or around the criminal element.
A condition of your parole.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.528
Come on, man. This is New Orleans.
There's a bar every 20 feet.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.524
- Ladies, please...
- Why are you hassling me?

04:32.680 --> 04:34.045
Because you don't listen.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.682
I told you you have to have a job
or you're in violation.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.326
Dancing is my job, okay? It's what I do.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.324
And how do I know this is legit?
You got a work slip?

04:43.480 --> 04:46.324
- You got a W-2 you can show me?
- This is bullshit.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.485
- You want me back in jail.
- You're not as dumb as you look.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.045
You know, kid, you answer to me
for the next six months.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.680
And I'm telling you now,
you're done with this.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.890
You got it or do we have a problem?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.960
No problem.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.964
Good. Let's move it.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.207
"Do we have a problem?"
Give me a break.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.409
That PO keeps busting my chops,
I'll swing at him one day.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.050
This place looks hot.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.524
What, Static? Yeah, it is hot, man.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.286
Number one underground
club in New York.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.887
You know, my brother started
that place with his partner, Kaz.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.883
That's him.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.206
Right. I see the family resemblance.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.170
We're foster brothers, obviously.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.770
You know, they're hiring
dancers up there at the moment.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.531
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Paying pretty good, too.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.124
Yeah.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.643
What are you doing?

06:19.800 --> 06:22.883
Won't let me dance here?
Hell with them. Going to Brooklyn.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.805
Six more months of parole.
You can't leave the state.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.931
- Hell, you can't even get in a club.
- Don't worry. I got a plan.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.244
Listen, if my parole officer calls,
just tell him I'm working the pipeline...

06:34.400 --> 06:37.609
- ...between Shreveport and Baton Rouge.
- Are you nuts?

06:37.760 --> 06:40.001
You call me.
I'll call him right back.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.730
I'll fly in for my check-ins.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.811
I'll be making so much money dancing
for Nick, I'll fly back first class.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.964
Crazy. If your foster bro
finds out you skipped parole...

06:49.120 --> 06:52.966
- ...he's sending you back.
- He doesn't need to know then.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.162
- Yo, D, have a good time.
- All right, man.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.840
<i>- I'll see you guys later.
- You owe me 50 bucks.</i>

07:07.000 --> 07:08.764
Check's in the mail.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.565
So I asked,
knelt right there by the pews.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.927
I said, "Girl, do you need a prayer?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.481
Because I would definitely
put hands on you."

08:08.640 --> 08:10.642
Nick, you said that to her in church?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.320
Choir practice, 6th grade.
Her name was Tiffany.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.245
Gave the Book of Psalms a remix.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.563
I don't know how you do it.
My lines always come out wrong.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.042
Because you got to commit to it.
You got to own it.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.080
- What's your best line?
- I ain't giving you shit.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.971
- Come on, man, what's your best line?
- My best line?

08:29.120 --> 08:33.044
All right, my best line.
Science class, 10th grade.

08:33.240 --> 08:39.087
I looked at this chick and I said,
"Baby, your lab bench or mine?"

08:40.720 --> 08:42.484
- Really?
- Man, I knew it.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.440
- That's your best line?
- Come on, man.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.762
How long since you seen your bro?

08:48.960 --> 08:52.203
Two years, man. Two years too long.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.806
Me and him used to get into some shit.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.528
Yeah, Nick here.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.688
What do you mean they're back?
I'm close. No, I'm close. I'll handle it.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.047
- I said I'll handle it.
- Who is it?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.884
Guess.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.285
Come on, we're late.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.009
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Natsumi.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.084
Shuffle heel toe.
Toe heel step. Shuffle heel toe.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.281
Do we have a party?

09:58.440 --> 09:59.930
- Yeah.
- Yes.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.207
Keep it going.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.368
- You okay?
- Yeah.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.528
Told you to stay out
of my neighborhood.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.206
Consider us your eviction notice.
Get the drums.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.728
- No. What are you doing?
- Whoa, easy there, Hello Kitty.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.326
Does it look like
I'm into Crouching Tiger?

10:45.480 --> 10:49.041
- You're disgusting.
- Yeah, you just get your ass out of here.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.283
Tell your brother
I won't be so easy on you next time.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.605
You Okay?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.250
Yeah.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.011
Who's that?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.768
- Hey, Nick. What's up?
- What's up, dude?

11:25.920 --> 11:28.400
- What's this? You got peach fuzz now?
- Shut up.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.291
<i>Look at you, Dukes of Hazzard,
where'd you get this?</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:34.410
Oh, you got jokes. I got it where I got it.

11:34.560 --> 11:38.281
- Thought you finished puberty.
- You got jokes.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.284
- Why were you so late?
- Got some business to handle.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.522
- Business?
- Business.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.242
Glad you finally called, baby brother.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.243
You know, I've been kind of busy.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.641
How's it feel to be
back in the free world?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.882
I'm not going through that ever again.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.725
I had this parole officer
on my case once a week.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.043
Couldn't step foot in a club, a bar.
Couldn't do anything.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.091
- No, I'm not going back to that.
- So you're a law-abiding citizen now?

12:03.280 --> 12:04.611
Good for you.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.804
I always knew you were tone-deaf.
I didn't say that.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.081
Long ways out, don't you think?

12:35.240 --> 12:37.686
Keeps its mystery that way.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.842
One-way street out there.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.004
You mean it avoids regular cop patrols.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.322
I knew you'd fit right in.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.762
Welcome to Static.
Standing room only five nights a week.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.649
- Nice.
- Did you get your brother?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.689
- Yes, sir. This is D, Raphael.
- Hey.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.050
Hey, man.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.165
- Don't even.
- I didn't say anything.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.287
This place used to be a factory.
Built ship motors, you believe that?

13:04.440 --> 13:07.728
Immigration buckled down,
sent the illegal's packing.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.360
The company didn't
want to pay real wages...

13:10.560 --> 13:12.881
- ...so they went chapter 11.
- You stepped in.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.567
We are the DIY generation, bro.
Come on, my place is around back.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.084
- I finished all the invoices.
- Great.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.169
And you must be Donny.
I'm Tatianna.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.045
Hi. Yeah, I've seen your
body painting dance online.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.050
- It's cool. I like it.
- She keeps our IT straight.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.846
And his ass out of trouble.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.567
You'll keep pushing
until something pops off.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.405
Pops off? I'm not the one who started it.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.210
Then be the man and end it.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.886
Come on, little brother,
I'll show you around.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.764
You grew up with this guy?

13:46.440 --> 13:48.761
Yeah, since I was 6.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.206
This is the room
that Kaz used to stay in.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.250
Right here is where we
first dreamt up Static.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.243
So when do I meet him?

13:58.440 --> 14:01.922
- That ain't gonna happen.
- I thought you guys were partners.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.926
Were. You wouldn't believe
the stuff that's gone down, man.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.242
- So what happened?
- There was this guy...

14:08.400 --> 14:11.882
Michael Griffith. Made millions
on Wall Street swapping bonds...

14:12.080 --> 14:13.600
when everybody else was in the toilet.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.202
Sleazy bastard would roll through
three times a week with clients.

14:17.360 --> 14:20.443
He'd buy out VIP.
Just dumb all the way around.

14:20.600 --> 14:25.049
And then she walked in.
Aya, Kaz's sister.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.521
We let her and her crew
perform at the club.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.087
Michael became obsessed with her.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.801
Kept hitting on her
like she was the sweetest deal in town.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.204
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah, she all right.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.921
Kaz painted it. Matter of fact,
he painted all of this.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.448
Anyway, Aya wouldn't give
Michael the time of day.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.490
Michael whispers to Kaz
that I'm screwing him over.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.642
Says he'll set him up in a new club.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.962
Promises that his sister can dance there.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.925
- New club?
- Now they're our competition.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.882
Really walked into it here, huh?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.528
You'll catch up.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.843
Say, man. Make yourself at home.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.287
- All right.
- Oh, hey...

15:08.440 --> 15:10.090
I'm glad you're here.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.083
Are you okay? You weren't hurt?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.605
- We're fine.
- You sure?

15:25.760 --> 15:27.171
Yeah.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.802
- Where's Natsumi?
- I'm in here.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.760
Not you. No guns in my house.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.365
Wait...

15:41.280 --> 15:42.930
Told you guys not to go there.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.368
- If you want to rehearse, use OTC).
- I'm on a deadline.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.010
- For what?
- For work.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.766
We're meeting a woman
later this week. A producer.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.685
- Who this time?
- With Racketeer. She's real.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.686
So was the last one. So is the banks,
asking for their credit cards back.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.888
Now I gotta buy you guys new drums.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.646
I'll take care of my own problems.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.768
Look, Michael would
invest in your show.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.649
- Please.
- He works Wall Street.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.371
And that road connects
everywhere, including INS.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.569
This producer could sponsor me.
I don't need Michael.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.087
If they sign, produce and sponsor you.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.208
Okay? Your visa's up in three weeks.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.046
- You could say, "Good luck."
- They're gonna send you back to Japan.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.522
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked to get you here?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.166
It took three years
just to get you on a plane.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.245
- I am doing this for us.
- And I want us to do it the right way.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.202
I need the bathroom!

16:44.600 --> 16:45.601
Toilet!

16:52.920 --> 16:55.446
Hope you don't need your bowl.
He will use it.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.604
It's okay. Michael gave it to me.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.244
It's your rent.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.287
- Will you talk to her for me?
- Sure.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.521
Are you serious?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.280
It's Gina. She wants to know the plan.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.808
Tell her to get dressed.
We're gonna do a show.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.369
Hold up right there.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.530
Rusko's spinning tonight.
We're gonna have a full house.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.650
All right. You don't
have to worry about patrols.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.088
Knew I could count on you.
This is B, New York's finest.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.846
This is Donny.
Newbie's gonna be helping me out.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.650
Cool.

17:57.320 --> 18:02.611
See, he'll warn us if the ABCs are sniffing
for a spot without a liquor license.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.002
What am I going to be doing here
anyway?

18:06.160 --> 18:08.527
Learning. Tend bar,
work street promotions...

18:08.680 --> 18:11.206
do some inventory,
follow me for a year or so.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.687
- Year?
- You always want things yesterday.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.888
Give it time. We're gonna open clubs...

18:16.040 --> 18:19.010
in Manhattan, Queens,
maybe one with your name on it.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.851
Want me to walk around
selling Jager shots too?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.368
- You're the one that called me.
- Give me something real to do.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.966
It's complicated, man.
You don't just dive in.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.963
You gotta earn it.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.885
We're live at Static
where a dozen artists will be...

18:33.040 --> 18:36.203
auctioning their work to buy
art supplies for schools.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.522
Put a smile on your face, would you?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.722
Hey. How's my favorite blogger?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.723
- Good to see you.
- You too.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.963
As always we are so happy
to give back here at Club Static.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.806
End of the day, it's about collaborating
with as many people as I can.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.930
You all make sure you
come on out and support. Much love.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.085
You heard it from the man himself.
Now get down here to Static and support.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.566
- Nicky.
- What's up?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.606
It's always like this.
You never give me a chance.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.091
Nobody gave me shit.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.402
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Wall Street.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.485
I don't care what they say, you boys
deserve those bonuses, you hear me?

19:20.680 --> 19:24.002
That's what we do. Cheers.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.561
- Maybe she'll be your next bond.
- Maybe.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.723
You know what that is.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.962
Check your watches
and lace your sneaks.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.531
It's showtime.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.684
Give it up for the Kings and Queens.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.811
Cut it.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.804
Aya.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.522
I bet I could do some of that.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.680
It's a long way from
dancing on a street corner.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.167
But I could. I could do
something different.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.800
- Bring something new.
- You criticizing my shit?

21:28.960 --> 21:30.530
No, I didn't say that.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.200
I worked way too hard
for you to mess things up.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.806
- Whatever.
- It's not whatever, it's what is.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.881
I'm going to get a closer look.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.881
Just stay off my stage.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.164
Move, man, move.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.646
Get out the way.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.564
<i>Hey-</i>

24:34.720 --> 24:35.881
- Move.
- Back it up.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.845
What's this? Who's this?

24:41.560 --> 24:44.609
- Come on. Let's not get into it.
- We own this.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.682
Oh, my gosh.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.207
Cobu is back in the house.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.650
Yeah.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.208
How the hell did they get in here, huh?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.124
I don't know.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.290
You're fired.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.841
What are you doing?

26:52.760 --> 26:55.969
<i>Cobu. Cobu. Cobu.</i>

27:07.360 --> 27:11.206
Ladies and gents,
how many clubs do you see this in?

27:11.720 --> 27:14.530
Yo, people, people. What is going on?
Make some noise.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.728
Welcome back, Aya.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.724
- Give me some tape. Give me some tape.
- What? Hang on.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.211
Here you go.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.250
That's some serious execution.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.970
Out of the way.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.327
What?

27:42.560 --> 27:43.561
All right.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.843
Whoa, has she met her match,
ladies and gentlemen?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.604
All right.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.411
We got a battle on our hands.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.924
You ready to get this place
jumping old-school style?

28:17.040 --> 28:18.530
Let me see your hands up.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.884
You Okay?

28:27.160 --> 28:28.764
No.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.727
- Again?
- Hey.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.125
Come outside for a second.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.089
Raphael.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.608
Hey, get the hell out of here.
What do you think you're doing?

29:26.160 --> 29:28.606
- Give me that beer.
- Yo, behind you.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.611
All right.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.204
All right.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.522
Yo, Nick, we got a hiccup.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.884
Put it away.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.610
What's up, Nick?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.081
Why don't you get out?
What you looking at?

30:02.240 --> 30:03.321
Take her with you.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.528
All I want is the drums you stole.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.728
I told you to stay away from my sister.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.723
I can handle this.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.010
Show our guests out.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.531
No need to be gentle.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.887
I give this hole in the wall two weeks.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.320
- Let's go.
- No.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.165
- Let me go.
- Hey. You're hurting her, man, come on.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.560
<i>Hey-</i>

30:23.320 --> 30:24.367
You crazy, man?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.082
Kaz, we'll kill you.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.051
Let's go.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.091
Aya.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.129
- Hey, Nick, you all right?
- Let's go.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.761
<i>Hey-</i>

30:47.400 --> 30:49.084
Aya.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.320
- Come on. Come on.
- Aya.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.606
What?

30:53.760 --> 30:55.489
Aya.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.850
GO, go!

30:58.040 --> 30:59.610
Aya.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.281
All right, we made it.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.571
- Who are you?
- What?

31:10.760 --> 31:11.966
Who are you?

31:12.120 --> 31:14.600
You jump up on the bar,
put cans on your feet.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.888
- Who does that?
- You were up there too.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.130
Where to?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.489
- Ten blocks at the subway.
- Okay.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.051
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.007
It's a tight squeeze here,
don't you think?

31:28.160 --> 31:31.562
File a complaint. I am a courier too.
I have many jobs.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.327
It is New York.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.128
Are you okay?

31:46.360 --> 31:47.964
He hit you.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.008
Been popped harder.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.330
I'm Donny.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.330
Aya.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.320
Yeah, I know.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.684
How do you know Nick?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.844
He's my brother.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.411
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.484
Well, our moms used
to work together. Mine split.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.405
So Nick and his mom took me in
when I was just a kid.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.688
So, yeah, he's my brother.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.127
- This is crazy.
- It was kind of crazy.

32:21.280 --> 32:25.524
- But we kind of got used to it.
- No, no, no. You saw what happened.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.967
Nick and Kaz were ready
to kill each other.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.363
Listen, I just got in today.
I'm not into all that back there.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.529
You're in it now.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.641
What the...?

32:40.640 --> 32:41.801
Stop.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.962
- Don't.
- Well, how can I find you?

32:44.120 --> 32:45.406
Give me your phone.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.130
Aya.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.007
Come on.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.004
- Didn't know my phone could do that.
- Go.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.645
Let's go.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.644
Are you fucking crazy?
Someone could have been killed.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.411
No, stop it.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.407
We can keep this up right here
if you want.

33:07.880 --> 33:11.248
Either shoot somebody or pay me.
My meter's running.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.843
Get in the car now.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.164
Get in the car.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.405
In the car.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.450
- What kind of stunt was that, huh?
- What are you doing?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.728
Someone could have been hurt.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.691
See? This is exactly
what I warned you about.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.127
You don't know shit.
You been here one day.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.964
Look at the mess you've caused.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.964
Listen, I have nothing to do
with you and her brother.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.329
- I told you to stay off my stage, didn't I?
- I was on the bar.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.041
I'm gonna hire a babysitter next time.
Now get your ass in the car.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.123
Yo, let's roll.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.088
Forget this.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.527
Man, you don't even know
where you're going.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.723
Yo, Nick, you want me
to go get him?

34:10.880 --> 34:12.324
No.

34:12.480 --> 34:16.121
Let him dance with a hat
on the ground for a few days.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.126
<i>You've reached Nick.
You know what to do.</i>

35:12.320 --> 35:14.049
Hey, man, it's Donny.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.283
Just give me a call back when you can.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.169
Wish us luck.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.247
We put this together for you.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.851
Thank you.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.728
- How many girls do you use again?
- Six, counting me.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.282
This next one has a softer vibe.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.605
That's better.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.764
So when are you performing next?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.688
We don't really have a spot right now.

36:39.880 --> 36:43.407
But I need to see you live,
in front of a crowd.

36:43.560 --> 36:46.291
The audience goes crazy
when they see us.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.930
It happened the other night.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.730
But I wasn't there.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.291
Camille. Your 2:30's here.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.327
Look, we produce live acts.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.921
We find you names to tour with
or open for.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.641
We connect you with investors
to fund off-Broadway runs.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.646
But we need to know if there's
an audience for anything we back.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.486
Good luck.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.206
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

38:31.760 --> 38:35.287
Admit it. You were only there last night
to show Nick up.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.445
- You hate losing as much as I do.
- I didn't lose.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.848
You did give him your number...

38:52.040 --> 38:53.087
Michael.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.368
He's even learning Japanese
to impress you.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.007
I understood some of that.
My impressive Japanese, right?

39:02.160 --> 39:03.844
Natsumi. Hi.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.082
Aya, how are you?

39:06.280 --> 39:08.044
Good, thank you.

39:18.200 --> 39:23.366
<i>Let's hear it one more time
for Blueprint Cru.</i>

39:28.920 --> 39:30.524
New system sounds great.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.121
A little too much bass, if you ask me.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.770
<i>Hey-</i>

39:34.920 --> 39:38.970
- Here we go with the Korean again.
- Maybe he didn't want you to understand.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.804
So come on, let's do this.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.645
Sunday night,
you and your girls perform here.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.088
- You can go on as late as midnight.
- We can invite Camille.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.806
- Camille?
- This producer that's interested in us.

39:49.960 --> 39:50.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.805
She just needs to see us live
in front of a crowd.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.088
Want to use my place
for your audition?

39:56.240 --> 39:59.244
Your and my brother's place,
you mean.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.320
Yeah, I don't think
it's gonna work like that.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.644
See, if you perform here, it's exclusive.
Nowhere else.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.681
<i>- Look, it's just business, okay?
- I'll tell you what. I'm a fair guy.</i>

40:12.840 --> 40:17.402
I'll match whatever this producer offers
and I'll add 2 percent of the door.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.840
That's good business.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.923
Thank you, but no.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.320
Aya.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.000
I said, no, thank you.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.162
- Excuse me.
- Aya.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.850
Aya.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.363
I got guests to show backstage.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.171
Let's get a technician in
to calibrate that bass.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.440
<i>Put your hands together,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

40:40.600 --> 40:44.366
<i>Tonight's headliner,
all the way from Korea.</i>

40:44.520 --> 40:47.091
<i>U-Know.</i>

42:19.640 --> 42:21.051
<i>Hey-</i>

42:21.800 --> 42:23.962
What are you doing here?

42:24.120 --> 42:26.202
If Kaz sees you...

42:29.960 --> 42:31.803
Forget your brother.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.489
I came to see you.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.524
What we did last night...

42:36.680 --> 42:39.490
I haven't done something like that
in a long time.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.163
It was amazing.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.604
It was okay.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.330
Okay?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.241
Well, what if I said I was holding back?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.765
Then I'd say you're lying.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.203
- Let's get out of here then and find out?
- No, I can't.

42:54.360 --> 42:57.728
- I have to work.
- This late?

42:57.880 --> 43:01.851
Something happened at Static.
I don't know what it was.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.409
You felt it too.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.730
I don't even know you.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.564
We can solve that problem.

43:08.720 --> 43:13.169
We can't solve anything.
Kaz, my brother, could hurt you.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.203
I'm not afraid of him.

43:17.840 --> 43:21.765
Well, there's the door. Let's just get
out of here, okay? Nobody's looking.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.682
This way.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.966
Hi, Aya.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.248
Rei, Kaori, I need your help.

43:33.080 --> 43:35.242
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

43:35.400 --> 43:36.447
Keep it on.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.322
Get him out of here... Hurry!

43:39.480 --> 43:40.606
- Go. Go.
- Aya.

43:50.840 --> 43:54.367
- I just want you to be successful.
- I'm not gonna work for Michael.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.841
I'll be here, okay?
Nothing's gonna happen.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.048
You can't always protect me.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.643
What if Nick's right?

44:04.800 --> 44:07.406
What if all you did was steal his idea?

44:08.280 --> 44:09.770
Steal?

44:09.920 --> 44:12.241
He's the one who screwed me, okay?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.084
And you can't patent an idea.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.562
I opened up a real club,
not some underground joint.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.961
Nick has to bend rules and skirt laws.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.770
He can never do what I've done.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.924
But how much of yourself
have you given up?

44:31.080 --> 44:33.367
You're running out of time, Aya.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.365
- Come on.
- Hey.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.442
I don't believe you paid
the cover charge.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.285
Yeah, your joint's over-priced.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.123
Did Nick send you?

45:05.360 --> 45:08.330
No, I just wanted to see this dump
for myself.

45:09.800 --> 45:13.885
Well, now that you've seen it,
don't come back here no more.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.246
One thing.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.488
What kind of shampoo
does this guy use?

45:20.360 --> 45:23.842
What is this? What is this? Are you nuts?
If someone sees.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.490
It's Nick's brother.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.802
You're that Wall Street prick, right?

45:27.960 --> 45:30.486
Yeah, he came looking for Aya.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.729
Come on, let's go.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.645
Let's go.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.201
Come on, man.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.325
Five, six, seven, eight.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.007
Turn, jump-

48:04.800 --> 48:06.325
Turn, jump-

48:07.400 --> 48:08.845
Right.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.809
Left.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.931
Amazing. Next group.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.130
Thanks.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.809
Hey, I'm here, right? Let's go.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.561
Okay.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.446
- You ready?
- Yeah.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.170
- You want to speed up?
- Okay.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.085
- Speed up?
- Let's go. Five, six, seven, eight.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.766
- Turn, jump.
- What?

48:37.160 --> 48:38.605
Turn, jump-

48:42.920 --> 48:44.649
Come on. That wasn't bad, right?

48:44.800 --> 48:48.964
I mean, it wasn't great,
but it wasn't bad.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.804
Rookie.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.845
Sorry.

48:54.520 --> 48:55.521
Okay.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.648
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye-bye.

48:57.800 --> 49:01.202
- Bye, thanks.
- Bye. Good night. Bye.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.043
Nice class.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.643
Can't you take a hint?

49:16.320 --> 49:17.526
I'm not going anywhere.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.569
Not without that dance.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.729
All right? One dance.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.607
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.369
How did I do, teach?

51:23.840 --> 51:29.483
I give you an F. But for extra credit,
I'll let you buy me dinner.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.010
- No, you don't have to do that.
- You've got to see this.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.527
Red Bull.
They're canceling our sponsorship.

51:40.680 --> 51:42.091
Here's why.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.362
This just got posted.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.844
Links are everywhere.

51:48.040 --> 51:52.204
YouTube, Facebook,
Yelp, Foursquare.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.210
<i>- Let go of her. You're hurting her.
- What?</i>

52:00.720 --> 52:02.688
Shit didn't happen like that.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.524
There were no gunshots.

52:04.720 --> 52:07.724
"Static, Brooklyn. Avoid at all costs."

52:09.480 --> 52:11.642
He's trying to shut us down.

52:14.520 --> 52:17.410
If you want the digs,
you have to pay premium.

52:17.560 --> 52:19.608
Premium.

52:20.440 --> 52:23.762
No, no, no. Screw you, Lawrence.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.642
Damn Brits again.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.848
They don't take no for an answer.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.405
DJ's samples.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.689
- And you still need to approve these.
- Thanks.

52:35.720 --> 52:39.247
They're not going to renew her visa
again. You know that, right?

52:39.400 --> 52:41.164
She may never feel the same way.

52:41.320 --> 52:45.211
Then again she might.
If she just gives it a chance.

52:45.360 --> 52:48.125
Why her?
I mean, you can have anyone you want.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.408
She's not anyone.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.483
Man, she fights.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.085
She doesn't quit.

52:54.240 --> 52:58.370
Look, I can have the paperwork done by
Monday. I have an attorney on standby.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.488
Is she going to work here or not?

53:00.640 --> 53:03.291
So what?
Stealing my ideas wasn't enough?

53:03.440 --> 53:04.601
- Step back.
- Don't try.

53:04.760 --> 53:08.526
- Now you're trying to ruin me?
- I take it you're not here for a drink.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.286
Don't play stupid.
It's all over the Internet.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.442
- You got some nerve.
- Man, shut up.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.604
- You like the club?
- Look, Kaz built everything you have.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.922
Found your promotions,
your sponsors...

53:19.080 --> 53:22.129
that took your hole-in-the-wall club
to the next level.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.205
And where did you get off sitting
in my VIP with a boner for his sister?

53:29.240 --> 53:32.050
So, what's it feel like pimping her out
to this fool?

53:32.200 --> 53:35.966
You didn't keep your promises.
All I wanted was to be treated fairly.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.645
You were a street artist.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.929
- Get out or I'm calling the cops.
- Go on. Pizza'll get here faster.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.970
We were partners
and you kept everything for yourself.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.246
You were hired help.

53:45.400 --> 53:50.122
Unless you're here for that drink,
I have a business to run.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.487
Yeah, well, so do I.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.291
And that's the last time
I plan on saying it.

54:00.120 --> 54:03.841
Hey, and tell that runt brother of yours
to stay the hell away.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.806
I can't get those drums of yours
out of my head.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.291
They were great.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.448
They're from Asia. It's called taiko.

54:22.600 --> 54:26.207
What's that lettering on the front?
What does that mean?

54:26.360 --> 54:28.806
Cobu. It's the name of our crew.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.200
Cobu?

54:30.360 --> 54:35.207
It means, dance like drumming,
drum like dancing.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.483
Drum like dancing.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.244
I like that.

54:39.720 --> 54:44.567
One producer's interested in us,
but she has to see us play live.

54:44.760 --> 54:49.288
And if she backs us, I'll be able to stay.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.686
- Stay?
- In America.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.728
- Wait, otherwise you have to leave?
- In three weeks.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.609
That's crazy.

54:58.760 --> 55:02.560
Wait, if this lady signs you
then she can get you a work visa, right?

55:02.720 --> 55:06.566
Yeah, but it costs money
to book a space.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.241
And I'm broke.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.401
What are you gonna do?

55:13.400 --> 55:16.051
- Change the subject.
- That's what you're gonna do?

55:16.200 --> 55:19.249
Okay. All right. All right. All right.
I won't ask anymore.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.243
So, what's next for you?

55:22.440 --> 55:25.364
- What do you mean?
- Are you going to perform in Static?

55:26.160 --> 55:27.810
Nick and I, we have issues.

55:27.960 --> 55:31.965
I know he wants the best for me, but
you know the whole older-brother thing?

55:32.120 --> 55:33.406
- Oh, yeah.
- It gets old.

55:33.600 --> 55:36.604
I know.
There's so much I can't tell my brother.

55:36.760 --> 55:41.687
Well, you know, sometimes I've learned
it's better not to say anything.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.083
And easier, too.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.730
What?
Ls there something you want to say?

55:53.240 --> 55:59.122
You know, dancing, I like it, but it's been
more about making money for me.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.246
I don't get it.

56:02.400 --> 56:05.609
When I move my feet,
people are all watching what I'm doing...

56:05.760 --> 56:09.048
instead of paying attention
to what's going on around them.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.409
I was just a distraction. I was working
with a bunch of guys.

56:12.560 --> 56:15.484
You know, pickpockets,
credit-card thieves, you name it.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.809
Just about anything
you could take from tourists, we did.

56:19.200 --> 56:23.091
I was young, but I knew better.

56:24.120 --> 56:28.330
This one guy
was working a pretty big scam.

56:28.480 --> 56:32.326
And one day I got caught.

56:33.800 --> 56:36.770
And I had to serve two years in jail.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.603
Would you do it again?

56:50.680 --> 56:52.170
No.

56:52.920 --> 56:57.289
No, I've moved on from all that.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.609
Do you mean that?

57:05.600 --> 57:07.011
Yeah.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.164
Yeah, I mean that.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.366
- I love the way you talk.
- Shut up.

57:19.520 --> 57:24.367
No, I do. The way your words sound.
It's cute.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.363
I'm trying.

57:26.520 --> 57:28.887
Anyways, this is it.

57:30.440 --> 57:35.207
Hey, how do you say it in Japanese,
"Good night"?

57:38.360 --> 57:40.886
- What?
- And in Korean:

57:44.560 --> 57:46.005
You speak both.

57:46.160 --> 57:49.403
I'm Korean in blood, born in Japan.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.722
Our histories are long
and complicated.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.726
Maybe it's why I love it here.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.165
All right.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.330
What is it?

58:18.560 --> 58:21.040
Your grades are improving.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.322
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

58:28.240 --> 58:31.164
- You can teach me that one tomorrow.
- Maybe.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.683
<i>- Hey, boss.
- What's up, Jim?</i>

58:49.880 --> 58:53.805
Get everything you can for me
on a real pain in the ass, Donny Bray.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.803
He's a dancer from New Orleans.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.610
- Call me back.
- Yes, sir.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.367
Kaz here.

59:07.560 --> 59:10.211
Your sister's been hanging out
with Nick's brother.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.641
I expect you to do something
about it.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.884
These are Michael's guests from Britain.
This is Lawrence.

59:17.040 --> 59:20.806
Dublin, not Britain. I've been
waiting an hour. The sod's ducking me.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.291
Michael's been delayed.

59:22.440 --> 59:25.489
He'll crap his pants
if I get my hands around his neck.

59:25.640 --> 59:28.007
Why don't you guys enjoy yourselves,
okay?

59:28.160 --> 59:30.083
Natsumi, buy these men a drink.

59:31.400 --> 59:32.640
I'll take your drink.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.326
But I'm not enjoying shit.

59:48.760 --> 59:50.125
<i>Everybody check this out.</i>

59:50.280 --> 59:55.446
<i>I want to give a toast to my man Kaz.
Hard work. Blood, sweat and tears.</i>

59:55.600 --> 59:59.286
<i>Static is going to be a huge success.
Thank you, guys, for coming out.</i>

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.011
<i>I love you, man.</i>

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.530
<i>- I owe this guy everything.
- L owe this guy everything.</i>

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.401
<i>Club Static's gonna be the hottest club
in New York.</i>

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.770
Here's the tally for tonight.
And Aya left this for you.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.611
Thanks.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.601
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.240
<i>- Yo, D, it's me, man.
- Hey, Rene', what's up?</i>

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.842
Your PO won't stop snooping.
Whatever you're doing, do it quick.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.924
You're digging yourself in a hole,
deeper every minute.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.923
<i>- Okay, man, all right.
- Peace.</i>

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.441
We're off 15 percent.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.443
But it really hit us in VIP.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.250
Maybe it was just a slow night.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.961
Back-to-back slow nights
all because of that damn video.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.441
Nick, what are you going to do?

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.601
<i>Hey-</i>

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.967
Nick, what?

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.769
Hey, can we talk?

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.562
You got a lot of nerve, man.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.963
You disappear for four days,
then you blow back up in here.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.281
I'm here now, okay?

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.131
- It's too late. I got bigger problems.
- Let me help.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.169
- Come on, put me to work.
- Whatever.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.328
Bobby. You got another back to use.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.448
- No, not that.
- Well, then what?

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.204
What I do.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.806
That New Orleans thing
ain't gonna cut it here.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.806
You said it. You want this club
to feel fresh and new. Then mix it up.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.767
Come on, man, I can do this.
Just give me a shot.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.244
All right. We'll call it an audition.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.243
You'll be outside tonight.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.850
Inside.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.247
Inside and on-stage.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.247
You got one shot.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.445
One dance.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.330
Don't blow it.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.761
I'm gonna want the house band, too.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.644
Raphael's gonna need your camera
tonight.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.689
And then he had an idea
for a routine and it wasn't bad.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.481
- Maybe we should try it out sometime.
- You're supposed to be working.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.405
You've been talking about this guy
since I walked in.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.962
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.320
Are you sure about this,
with everything that's going on?

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.491
I know. It makes no sense.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.162
You really do like him.
And you never like anybody.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.410
Okay. Okay.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.167
Most guys just take, you know?
They want to control me.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.728
- Like Michael.
- And Kaz.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.249
Plus I'm always busy.
I don't have time for a guy.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.644
But this one, Donny?

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.163
I want to make time for him.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.011
Well, don't worry. You've only known him
a few days. It won't last. He's a guy.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.569
Come see the dust fly tonight?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.449
Where is he?
Is he going to do this or not?

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.850
Hey, can I borrow these?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.526
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.167
All right, people,
give it up for New Orleans in the house.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.362
- Come on, man.
- Come on, man.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.089
Excuse me.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.651
Let's get it started.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.769
Four on the floor.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.851
Yeah.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.644
Come on, get up here.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.122
All the hoofers, let's go.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.969
Let's go, come on, baby.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.925
That's right.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.724
That's my brother. That's my brother.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.046
That's my brother.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:54.126
All right, well, this is it.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.328
Just make yourself at home.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.766
- Do you want a drink?
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.281
We've got pretty good
tap water in there.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.930
No.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.049
I'm sorry it's such a mess.
I haven't really been staying here much.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.766
I was so proud of you tonight.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.726
Thanks.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.369
Probably wouldn't have done it
if it hadn't been for you.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.650
Would you miss me
if I had to go back to Japan?

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.124
More than you know.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.325
Yo, yo, Donny.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.369
Come get some breakfast over here.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.491
Just whipped up some grillades,
fried some beignets.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.485
Oh, wow, okay.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.009
Now I know why you danced
like you had a hard-on.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.323
Just wait here, okay?

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.003
Come on, man, don't OD it.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.084
What the hell are you thinking?
Kaz will come after you.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.768
- You guys created this together, man...
- Screw him. It's you and me now.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.365
We're back.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.127
And all those dreams we thought died,
us running our own joint...

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.608
hiring and firing, making our own rules,
it can happen. Now.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.366
That's you, Nick.
That's always been about you.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.284
You want to dance now, fine.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.171
There. You just got paid to dance.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.369
Next shift is tonight at 10.
Just give up the girl.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.809
Not a chance.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.731
Does she know?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.050
Does she know you quit
everything you ever start?

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.882
And when you think you have it...

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.045
you hold it for five seconds
and then you let it go like you always do?

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.286
- We're out.
- "We"? It's "we" now? Get back here.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.851
I said, we're out.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.404
I'm done.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.923
- What's going on?
- Come on.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.082
Donny, wait a sec...

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.405
Nick?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.246
Nick.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.765
Is it done?

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.160
What?

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.009
You saw them.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.687
- She spent the night.
- I said, is it done?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.926
You can't do this now.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.801
Look, if you won't do it,
I'll hire somebody that will.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.290
Ten minutes.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.326
It's still uploading.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.925
Thank you.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.522
I can't believe he talked to you
that way.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.966
Forget it. That's Nick.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.201
"Forget it"?

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.648
Did you see the way he looked at me?
So much hate in his eyes.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.723
Listen, Aya, forget it. All right?

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.291
It's me and you now.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.650
But then what? He's your brother,
Kaz is mine. We can't change that.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.246
I told my brother
to shove it in front of you.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.241
If it wasn't for him growing up, I'd get my
ass kicked three times a week, not twice.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.129
I'm feeling this too.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.163
So you think I'm not?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.651
- You didn't answer my calls.
- Sorry. I had my phone off.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.285
What?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.844
What's going on?
Speak English, already. Please.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.889
Let's go, Aya. Now.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.644
I'll call you later, okay?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.126
Aya.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.287
Taxi.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.280
- I think we got it. We'll be in touch.
- Okay, thanks.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.484
They found the car in an alley.
It had been stolen.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.051
Was anyone hurt?

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.846
- Luckily, no.
- Yeah, but we could still get sued.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.843
The police recommend we shut down.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.850
- If things are that serious...
- Things are that serious.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.965
I got clients from out of town. This is
bad for business, my investment.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.485
I'll handle Nick, okay?

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.529
- Nick?
- Look, you've had your chance.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.206
I'm relieving you of running OTO.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.885
- What?
- This is my club.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.044
This is our club.
And I own 51 percent.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.202
- You can't do that.
- I can do that.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.250
After last night, we'll be lucky
to draw half capacity.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.042
Stay on as adviser, but you're through with
day-to-day operations. I call the shots.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.205
What did you say to me?
What did he say to me?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.445
Let him stay.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.843
I want you to see this.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.370
<i>Hey, guys, look at the headache
at OTO's last night.</i>

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.241
<i>You want fun without the drama?
Check it out at Static.</i>

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.966
I didn't know.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.408
- Why would we believe you?
- I don't care what you believe.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.161
- After all the lies your brother told?
- You stole from him.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.685
You gonna step to me?

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.046
Man, screw you.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.525
Break his legs.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.409
- He didn't do it.
- Out back.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.166
- Get off.
- I was with him all night.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.766
He didn't do it, okay?

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.770
Donny, I think you should go.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.407
Aya.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.130
Please.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.525
Okay.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.641
You back?
There's a slot open at 12 if you want it.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.721
Man, somebody could have been killed.
You used me.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.881
- Let him go.
- Get off me.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.161
I get knocked down,
I get up and I keep fighting.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.244
- That's all either of us know.
- Kaz didn't screw you.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.165
- You screwed yourself. You're an asshole.
- Nick.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.051
Nick.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.361
I couldn't stop them.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.204
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this?

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.169
- Where's B?
- B's suspended.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.245
- So are the others you bought off.
- This building was condemned in '09.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.564
You sublet it from a management
company that's not even licensed.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.803
This is his property now,
and we're here to escort you off.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.849
What? You can't throw me out.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.606
We can if you've been running
an illegal club.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.765
Serving alcohol without a license,
violating safety and fire codes.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.127
- I built this. This is mine.
- Not anymore.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.248
Everyone out, now. Let's go.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.164
I close million-dollar deals
before morning coffee.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.642
This? This is nothing.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.164
And you,
white trash with gourmet Chinese.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.810
Stick to dollar carryout.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.290
You son of a bitch.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.489
- Donny.
- Restrict that man right now. Let's go.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.001
Grab him. Get him out of here.
Let's go.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.049
Did you see that?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.642
That's assault, pal.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.287
Open up.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.843
Donny? Donny.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.520
Aya. Aya.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.486
Donny.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.530
She's okay. She's okay. She's with me.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.045
Bray.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.084
You're lucky.
Someone wants to cut you a break.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.045
Let's go.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.808
Keep moving straight ahead, please.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.604
Give us five minutes.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.649
We don't need those, do we?

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.970
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. You?

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.610
Let's go.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.404
So I know everything.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.801
I know you jumped parole
back in Louisiana.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.486
What?

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.441
- You forgot to mention that, didn't you?
- Aya, I...

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.284
It's complicated.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.331
Cops don't know it, yet. As soon
as they run your priors they'll find out.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.326
Then you'll be back to New Orleans
and back to jail for parole violation.

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.529
You had six months left. That's what?

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.206
Six more months behind bars.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.683
Doesn't have to be that way.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.169
Because here's the deal.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.209
That remains our little secret.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.045
I don't press charges
and you're free to walk out...

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.289
get on the next plane, train, bus,
I don't care what...

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.364
back to New Orleans
to never come back here again.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.125
And you come work for me.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.490
- Aya, no.
- Keep your little friend here out of jail.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.608
- Don't do it.
- Shut up.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.522
And I give your brother his job back.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.890
Normally, I give my clients
two minutes to decide...

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.566
once I put the deal on the table.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.521
Your time starts now.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.724
He can't do this.
Who the hell does he think he is?

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.329
Aya, I'm sorry. I tried to tell you.
I wanted to tell you.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.006
It doesn't matter now.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.083
I'm not even angry.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.562
- Where are you going?
- To accept.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.405
You can't.
I don't want you paying for my mistakes.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.608
There's nothing you can do.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.691
If you don't leave, you go back to jail.
I won't let that happen.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.765
<i>- I'll be fine, all right? Don't worry about me.
- Donny, take a look around.</i>

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.968
Look where we are.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.244
We had our time,
but you and I are over.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.323
So he's dropping the charges.
You're free to go.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.362
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Nick is looking for you.</i>

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.808
I know Nick's looking for me.
I need your help with something.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.969
- Is it on?
- Yeah, it's ready.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.167
Yeah? Okay.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.526
I left New Orleans Monday night.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.411
A day later, everything changed.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.803
<i>That's when I met Aya.</i>

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.209
<i>Since then a lot has happened.
It's been pretty crazy.</i>

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.682
And some of it you've probably
even seen on here.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.804
<i>As of today, the two hottest clubs
in Brooklyn are gone.</i>

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.601
<i>They shut down Static. Took it from Nick
and everyone who works there.</i>

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.928
<i>And Kaz has been demoted.</i>

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.367
<i>OTO will never be the same.</i>

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.645
<i>Yeah, maybe Nick and Kaz went too far
and let their egos get in the way...</i>

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.486
<i>but these guys created something
special. Something visionary.</i>

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.287
<i>But who really brought them down?</i>

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.568
<i>Some bullshit operator on Wall Street.</i>

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.166
<i>An asshole who ruined
everything for everyone.</i>

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.800
<i>One of those guys who has money
but nothing else.</i>

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.328
<i>No vision, no morals,
but they wind up with all this power.</i>

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.802
<i>So, what are we gonna do now?
Just stand by and let this go down?</i>

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.451
<i>Not me. Not anymore.</i>

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.211
I'm not gonna throw the towel in this time.
I'm making things happen now.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.725
<i>I'll start something new.</i>

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.929
<i>Bringing artists together
just like Nick and Kaz did.</i>

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.610
<i>So I'm hosting a pop-up club tonight.</i>

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.331
You guys wanna come down
and check this place out.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.603
It's gonna be a great night,
no cover charge.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.240
And you know what? Drinks are free.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.805
Free drinks?

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.407
We gotta fill this place up.
Gotta get them here somehow, right?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.369
- What if this doesn't work?
- It has to.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.000
Listen, just get everyone together,
okay?

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.481
<i>Go back to Static,
raid the liquor stash.</i>

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.531
<i>We've got a lot of work to do.
But don't tell Aya. Not yet.</i>

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.330
<i>We gotta time this just right.</i>

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.362
- Hi, I'm looking for a Camille.
- Camille Young?

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.686
Yes?

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.004
Hi. I'm with Cobu. I'm the manager.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.642
- Who? What are you talking about?
- The group with girls and drums.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.849
I've seen their stuff.
You gotta check them out. Amazing.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.606
And I came to give you this.
It's tonight.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.243
They'll be there with a live audience.
Everything you need to see them in action.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.731
Very nice. Thank you.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.564
Wait. You got to... Just...

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.888
And it starts at 10.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.565
So I'll see you there, right?

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.931
Maybe.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.846
Rocketeer Entertainment.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.002
- May I help you?
- Yeah, sorry.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.366
Yeah?

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.448
Thank you.
I knew you'd stick around.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.568
You're the only honest person I know.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.525
This is business.

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.603
You never touch me, you never try.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.764
Exclusive terms.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.681
My immigration lawyer's the best.
He'll look after everything you need.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.281
- And Kaz?
- Well, I tried calling him...

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.204
and he hasn't called me back.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.285
Maybe you can give him a shout
and talk some sense into him.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.726
I'll need you to sign where it's indicated.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.970
Don't I get two minutes?

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.244
Why don't you read it over?

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.683
You can bring it back with you
tomorrow night when you start.

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.121
<i>Hey, it's Donny, Nick's brother.</i>

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:02.170
<i>Listen, I need your help
promoting something.</i>

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.848
He's expecting you.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.690
The guy's a wanker.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.330
Thinks I'm a Brit.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.171
Thinks I'm Japanese.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.847
He's been screwing me out of deals
for months now.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.800
So the answer is, I'm interested.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.924
Yo, Nick, it's past 9.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.485
He's still not answering.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.608
- Forget him.
- Yeah?

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.648
- Let's go.
- All right.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.885
Wait.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.002
Your brother,
he kind of made other plans.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.487
- What are you doing out here?
- Kaz, I have to show you something.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.563
- I gotta go inside.
- Please.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.570
Please?

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.364
I'll be back.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.560
- This place?
- Yup.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.009
Come on.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.328
- All right, so where is he?
- Give it a minute.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.688
What's he doing here?

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.291
What's this about?

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.084
I told you.
Can you wait a little bit?

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.284
Come on.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.924
Wait.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.003
- Did you know Nick was here?
- Yes.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.646
Trust me, Camille's going to be here.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.765
There she is.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.723
I'll be right back.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.045
What's up, man?

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.290
Hey, welcome to OTO.
Under new management.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.369
- Thought there'd be more people.
- It's early, have a seat.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.807
- What are you drinking? Scotch.
- Scotch.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.965
Excuse me, sweetheart, can you get
a scotch for my friend? Thanks.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.491
Somebody hacked into our mailing list?

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.044
Oh, wait. One second.

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.286
<i>I left New Orleans Monday night.
A day later, everything changed.</i>

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.125
<i>That's when I met Aya.</i>

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.290
<i>All my life I've charged into things
without thinking.</i>

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.569
<i>Doing some pretty dumb stuff.</i>

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.771
<i>But I want to get something right.</i>

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.571
<i>I'm not going to throw the towel in
this time.</i>

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.844
<i>Not on you.</i>

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.846
<i>I left New Orleans Monday night.</i>

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.844
<i>A day later, everything changed.</i>

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.210
Why are you in Brooklyn, baby?

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.491
- I can't believe you did all this.
- I couldn't leave town.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.329
Not without one last dance.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.320
End this now.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.206
I already did.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.807
I sold my 49-percent share in OTO.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.891
What?

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.522
Oh, and by the way,
meet your new partner.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.729
Come on.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.882
What's worse than being partners
with a pissed off Irishman?

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.203
- What?
- When he's pissed at you, friend.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.522
Hey, come on.
Kaz. Kaz, you can't do this.

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.726
Kaz.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.726
Don't touch the shirt.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.930
Excuse me.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.967
Coming through.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.724
Excuse me.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.723
Hey, Kaz.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.329
Go finish this.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.371
All right, guys, come on.
Come on.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.123
- Cobu.
- Cobu.

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.601
Start tweeting.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.441
We're live right now...

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.367
right outside of Bushwick...

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.241
witnessing something new and unseen.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.930
Aya, you're amazing.
I'm so proud of you. That was great.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.491
Donny.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.650
What now?

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.131
I go back.

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.851
I do time. I finish parole.
It doesn't matter.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.441
I'll get through it.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.491
There you are.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.804
I loved what you did. I want to see you
in my office first thing Monday.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.689
Does this mean she can stay?

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.481
Bring your passport.
I'll take care of everything. And you.

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.722
You put all this together?

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.847
- He did.
- I want you dancing for me as well.

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.886
Well, I'm kind of booked
for the next six months.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.840
- I have to go back to Louisiana.
- But you're coming back?

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.928
Nothing could stop me.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.883
Are we good?

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.526
We're good.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.682
- Did good, little brother.
- Thanks, man.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.650
You know I brought your sax, right?
You're playing it.

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.564
- Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, man.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.451
Yeah!
