I asked about the part, he said he was
this close to making a decision.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.264
All right, Kathleen! Taking control.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.932
Yeah.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.101
Now, a woman my age would never high five.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.144
-But a woman in her 30s...
-Mm-hmm.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.397
He seems like an okay guy.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.149
Chuck? God, no, he's disgusting.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.777
He claims to have slept with
over a thousand women.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.695
That guy?

14:22.778 --> 14:25.155
Did not take him long
to tell me that either.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.282
Who's that lady?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.785
Oh, that's Nikki.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.121
She's new to the company.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.540
She's sweet,
but she's way heavier than she looks.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.585
Are you sure blondie's not gunning
for that lead part?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.712
She's really chatting him up over there.

14:40.212 --> 14:44.508
[Kathleen] Well, Chuck's the king.
It means he can hit on whoever he wants.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.719
The rules of the stage.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.806
Mmm. That doesn't sound real.
To hell with the rules.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.099
Go and stop that shit.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.226
You know what? You're right.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.645
To hell with the rules.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.148
[rock music playing over speakers]

15:02.401 --> 15:04.403
[inaudible dialogue]

15:09.533 --> 15:12.369
I think I'm gonna get this part.
I'm gonna be Anna.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.996
I'm gonna be the "I."

15:14.079 --> 15:17.041
Nice. You can act circles
around that Nikki.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.003
Right? Okay, wait here.
I gotta go fuck Chuck in the bathroom.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.298
-What? No. That's not what I meant.
-It's gonna work.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.383
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty good.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.844
-But--
-I've had way worse.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.139
I did a show once with that creepy
little guy from <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

15:34.016 --> 15:35.184
[sighs]

15:35.267 --> 15:37.645
All I know is,
no one else is getting that part.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.108
Couldn't find the guy. Coward.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.196
So, why don't you tell me your life story?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.116
Are you a boy or a girl?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.369
Let's find out.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.084
-You finished?
-Well, I didn't, but Chuck did.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.212
Let's go.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.926
I was with this one company in Des Moines.

16:09.009 --> 16:12.054
Some crazy, wild people in that theater.

16:12.137 --> 16:16.016
One night... a bottle of 100-proof tequila

16:16.100 --> 16:18.018
was poured on the stage

16:18.102 --> 16:21.855
-and the whole damn thing lit on fire.
-[chuckles]

16:21.939 --> 16:25.526
George Wendt lost an eyebrow.
Do you know who he is?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.237
He's the married one on <i>Cheers</i>.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.990
Seems fun. Why'd you leave?

16:31.407 --> 16:35.035
Well, they canceled the show
until the stage could be rebuilt.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.247
I didn't want to wait around
until next season.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.249
So, I moved on.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.085
-[Sophia] You've been all over.
-Yeah.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.878
Wait, stop.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.258
Tomorrow is Christmas,
and I don't have a tree.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.552
You want to steal one?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.222
Hell, yeah.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.933
[soul music playing]

16:59.852 --> 17:02.062
[both laughing]

17:04.231 --> 17:05.983
[Kathleen] It's a victimless crime, right?

17:06.066 --> 17:10.279
Yeah. Trees grow out of the ground.
So, how can you really own one to sell?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.864
You know, in 24 hours,

17:11.947 --> 17:15.284
these trees will just be
basically trash on the side of the road.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.411
-[Sophia] Ow!
-Okay. Okay.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.498
[grunts] We have no upper-body strength.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.292
Help us, Jesus.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.421
Help us steal. Silent night. [screams]

17:27.504 --> 17:28.964
Oh, it's stuck. It's stuck.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.091
[laughing]

17:32.134 --> 17:32.968
Yes!

17:35.012 --> 17:39.099
It doesn't really matter, because,
you know, Nasty Gal no longer exists.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.477
But she still doesn't wanna talk to me.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.729
You don't need her.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.398
You don't need anyone.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.610
Well, I kind of need, like,
the barista at Starbucks.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.446
'Cause, what, am I gonna,
like, hit a bunch of buttons,

17:52.529 --> 17:54.114
and then foam appears?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.742
-[laughs]
-Ta-da!

17:57.117 --> 18:00.621
Is it an ornament,
or a tangle of Satan's pubes?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.122
[chuckles]

18:03.207 --> 18:06.710
Gosh, you're so cool and fun.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.879
[groans]

18:10.672 --> 18:13.592
Why didn't I see that when you were 12?

18:16.553 --> 18:18.972
Well, we're out of wine.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.391
All we have is this.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.354
And there's not enough for the both of us,
so I'm just gonna take it.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.815
Mom.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.650
Mm?

18:31.735 --> 18:32.820
Why did you leave?

18:36.156 --> 18:37.699
[sighing] Oh, honey.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.868
Well...

18:44.123 --> 18:46.416
I know it's hard to understand, but I...

18:49.002 --> 18:51.547
I just had to get out of there.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.802
So, you don't think that I'm...
a garbage person?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.512
No, no.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.972
No, no, no.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.477
It had nothing to do with you.
I mean, it wasn't my dream to be a mother.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.771
But your father was...

19:08.480 --> 19:11.066
We... were doing so well.

19:11.150 --> 19:15.237
And then... suddenly,
he just stopped believing in me.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.738
Why?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.032
It's what he does.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.994
He crushes dreams.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.454
Yeah.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.166
There are a lot of things
I wasn't around to teach you.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.334
But here's something that I can:

19:30.544 --> 19:36.049
in life, the only one
who can make you happy is you.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.762
The great big lie
is that we need other people.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.017
But... [clears throat] No.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.895
The truth is...

19:51.064 --> 19:53.108
we all die alone.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.402
Totally.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.283
I really am my mother's daughter.

20:03.076 --> 20:07.456
You are your mother's manicurist.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.667
[both laughing]

20:14.171 --> 20:16.423
Well, I guess I...

20:17.132 --> 20:19.968
I'd better...
I'd better get to bed if I'm going to get

20:20.052 --> 20:21.845
my beauty sleep before the matinee.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.764
Make yourself at home.

20:25.557 --> 20:29.394
Hey. Why don't you stay a little longer?

20:29.478 --> 20:33.815
Like through the new year,
or as long as you want?

20:34.983 --> 20:38.362
Sure. Yeah.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.423
[all singing scales]

21:03.845 --> 21:04.846
Fun night, huh?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.431
Yeah, pretty fun.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.601
There'll be lots of nights like that
to come once you're my king.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.395
What do you mean?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.022
Anna does whatever her king asks.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.900
And I mean whatever.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.238
Oh, Kathleen, I'm sorry,
but Anna's going to someone else.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.159
-Wait. What was last night about?
-Last night?

21:26.243 --> 21:29.371
That was just two actors releasing
some pent-up energy after a show.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.750
You're joking right now, right?
This is a fucking joke.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.169
No. And even if I were,
it wouldn't change the fact

21:36.253 --> 21:38.964
that you are just too old
to play the role.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.718
I mean, I'm sorry, but Anna can't be 50.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.638
This is bullshit, and you know it, Chuck.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.515
I deserve that part.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.896
Well, if it's not me,
then who did get it?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.400
Tell me. Who got the part?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.737
As is customary,
I was going to make a formal announcement.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.990
But since you must know,
my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,

22:05.073 --> 22:07.743
the part of Anna in <i>The King and I</i>
goes to Nikki.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.536
Congratulations, Nikki.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.121
[laughing] Oh, shit.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.208
What's so funny, Topper?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.169
-Nothing.
-[Kathleen] Hm?

22:17.252 --> 22:19.504
'Cause the only thing
that I think is funny

22:19.588 --> 22:23.759
is your pathetic British accent.
It's almost as bad as Keith's résumé.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.219
-What the fuck did I do to you?
-It's not just you.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.972
It's this whole shitty,
amateurish production.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.974
-Jesus, Kathleen. Let's go outside--
-No!

22:31.058 --> 22:33.185
You're gonna shut up and listen to me.

22:33.268 --> 22:36.980
You wouldn't know a good actor
if she shit down your mouth.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.900
This entire theater lacks artistic merit.

22:39.983 --> 22:43.987
And you... You are a lousy lay.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.990
-Are you done?
-Oh, yeah, I'm done.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.994
-I'm out of here forever.
-[Chuck] Really? Where are you gonna go?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.747
-I'll go back to Des Moines.
-Des Moines, that's rich.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.583
You think Bobby's gonna take you back
after what you pulled?

22:56.666 --> 22:59.419
His fire insurance premiums
have doubled thanks to you.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.004
[Kathleen] I'll go back to Carbondale.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.632
Have fun.
Say hi to my picture on the wall.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.177
Fuck you, Topper.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.013
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Fuck all of you!

23:11.223 --> 23:13.183
Fuck this place and fuck everything!

23:14.434 --> 23:16.228
You can all kiss my ass.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.107
We're leaving.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.153
This is perfect.
It's Christmas, won't be any traffic.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.615
We'll just blow out of here
and not even look back.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.367
Blow out of here where?

23:30.951 --> 23:33.412
Oh, I don't know.
Somewhere. I'll figure it out.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.040
Hawaii. Oh, let's go there.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.543
We'll just lie on the beach
and eat pineapple

23:39.626 --> 23:42.379
-and be alone together.
