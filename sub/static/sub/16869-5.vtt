Come on, it's the least I can do.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.211
I mean, I love Joe, but at some point,
man needs his own space,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.960
and until I find my own space,
that means your space.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.804
So, as a token of my appreciation...

01:34.320 --> 01:36.322

01:36.520 --> 01:38.170

do you like it buttered or not?

01:38.360 --> 01:41.648
Barry, sometimes a man
just wants to butter his own bread.

Okay, sorry. I was just...
Yeah, no, you're right.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.931
Look, don't-- Don't get it twisted, okay?
I love having you here.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.522
You're a great guest. Not sure how
I feel about our other visitor though.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.968
- Wells?
-"Please, call me H.R."

01:54.200 --> 01:55.201
So, you don't like him?

01:55.400 --> 01:57.528
Well, it's not so much
that I don't like him. I just...

01:58.280 --> 02:01.250
The way he says things,
there's something about him.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.801
I don't know what it is.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.128
Dude, he's only been here a few days.
Let him settle in.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.761
I know we've had
our Wells issues in the past,

02:07.960 --> 02:09.848
but you can't just stop trusting everybody

02:10.039 --> 02:12.008

You can't live like that.

- Okay, all right.
-Yeah, I'll see you there.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.801
Yeah, well, I can take you.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.006
No. No. I'm gonna drive myself today.

- Can I help you?
-I'm here to see Dr. Tannhauser.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.241
Do you have an appointment?

02:52.480 --> 02:54.801
No, but I'm pretty sure she'll see me.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.525
You can just tell her
Caitlin Snow is here.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.690
Dr. Tannhauser is a very busy woman.
I'm sure you can understand.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.362
I appreciate the diligence, Jackie,
but Caitlin's always welcome here.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.562

03:05.960 --> 03:07.769
Nice to see you, too, Mom.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.964
So, what brings you here?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.886
Well, I didn't forget your birthday,
did I? I'm pretty sure I sent a card.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.248
You did. In April.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.841
Thank you.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.562
Look, I read your new paper
on applications in cryo-medicine,

03:23.800 --> 03:25.882
and I think you might be able to help.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.560
I had no idea you kept up on
the literature over at S.T.A.R. Labs.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.285
That's still what it's called, right?

03:30.520 --> 03:33.967
Yes, and I have a patient
who could use your help.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.651
Well, if you want to send over the file,

03:35.840 --> 03:37.444

04:16.760 --> 04:18.410
- Good morning.
-H.R.: Good morning.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.331

04:22.960 --> 04:26.328

04:31.320 --> 04:32.970

04:33.160 --> 04:35.606
Yes indeed, Miss West. (CHUCKLES)

04:35.800 --> 04:38.963
I took the liberty of
reading through your ledgers last night.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.527
A lot of information to absorb,
but let's see how I did.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.041

04:45.240 --> 04:51.009
Okay! And an iced Americano
with two-- No, three

04:51.200 --> 04:52.690
shots of espresso.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.691
That happened, Walter.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.161
- It's Wally.
-Wally!

04:57.400 --> 04:59.880
Now, for my fleet of foot friend...

05:00.720 --> 05:02.131

05:13.720 --> 05:15.563
- Thank you so much.
-(SPEAKING NORMALLY) You're welcome.

05:16.600 --> 05:21.083
Did you know on my Earth
coffee crop was wiped out by blight?

05:21.400 --> 05:26.486
I mean, that's one more reason to
stay on this Earth, for the coffee alone.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.971
Yeah, well, that's if you stay.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.561
If I stay, time is of the essence.
Here's what I propose.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.046
A series of team-building exercises.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.164
Now, I've hidden a series of clues
all around the facility.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.409
What I propose is,
we break into two groups, all right?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.886
And you can pick a partner.
You know what--

05:41.080 --> 05:45.529
Okay. I have to stop you, H.R.
lam not feeling this.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.808
It's the roast, isn't it?
I should have gone with a dark--

05:48.000 --> 05:50.480
No, it's not the roast, the roast is fine.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.449
Our trust isn't something that
you can just build with games.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.607

-No.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.689
<i>This is something
that goes back three years.</i>

05:57.880 --> 06:00.611
It's something that's been forged in fire.
Sometimes literally.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.806
So, maybe you should just
step back and observe.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.247
See what we do here, how we operate.
Did you get that?

06:07.440 --> 06:08.805
Excellent note. I'm gonna run with that.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.930
Where's Caitlin, by the way?
Have you seen--

06:11.120 --> 06:12.406
- Yes, so she was here.
-She was?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.961
- All right, yeah, you know, we talked...
-What?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.362
...and she knocked back
a triple-shot latte,

06:17.720 --> 06:20.326
and she left you a message.
So, I'm gonna...

06:21.880 --> 06:24.724
Yeah, let me just play it for you.

hidden in the facility.

You guys have been
at each other's throats for a year now.

That's just it.
From my perspective, it's been two weeks.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.970
to track the direction
the monster's heading in.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.207
(TRILLING)

10:16.480 --> 10:18.130
We got him. Head north three blocks.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.127
I lost him.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.567
Yeah, me, too.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.801
I don't get it. I don't get it.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.209
Every meta-human we've encountered
has been exactly that, meta-human.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.970
So, where did this thing come from?

10:38.240 --> 10:40.368
I don't know where it came from, man.
It just vanished.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.607
That's all I know. It was gone.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.491
Yeah, but in my experience,
things are always different.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.365
- What?
-Than they appear.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.086
There must be a reason the darn thing
can just disappear like that.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.248
Maybe the darn thing's got
some kind of cloaking mechanism.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.925
Uh, that's a good idea,

10:54.120 --> 10:55.884
but right now I would settle for,
"How can we stop it?"

10:56.080 --> 10:57.206
- Yes, obviously.
-How?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.926
- I don't know.
-We don't have a magic monster lasso.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.770
<i>H.R.: But you know what we could...</i>

11:02.080 --> 11:05.084
Oh, sorry, I forgot. I'm just observing.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.402
No, H.R., please,
we're open to any idea right now.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.371
On my Earth, we have ropes
made out of carbon fiber.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.763
They are ultralight,
but strong enough to pull a battleship.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.486
We could restrain it with that.
Right? What do you think?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.843
- Okay, I think it's...
-Okay.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.003
I think it's worth a shot.
We can spin it down in my workshop.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.241
Yes. Good.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.681
Yeah, there was something else
that was weird, though.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.770
I saw a transformer explode
as this thing passed by it.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.570
- That is weird.
-What's weird about that?

11:29.760 --> 11:32.604
Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.
it exploded before it got to it.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.446
Kind of reminds me of that Hitchcock movie
where the extra covers his ears

11:35.640 --> 11:36.687
before the gun goes off.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.127
You have Hitchcock on this Earth?
Oh, brilliant.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.370
Murder on the Titanic! "Who did it?"
"Who cares? We're drowning."

11:42.600 --> 11:44.568
The beast must emit
some kind of electrical pulse.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.643
Is there a way I could
get a look at that transformer?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.805
No. The whole place is a crime scene now,
with Julian in charge of it.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.122
Ah, Julian. Who's that?

11:52.280 --> 11:54.965
That's the CSI guy you don't like, right?

11:55.480 --> 11:56.641
Imean...

11:57.800 --> 11:59.086
Yeah, all right.

12:03.880 --> 12:04.961
He's great.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.731
Sorry. Cold hands.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.405
I didn't even notice.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.761
- I'm Nigel, by the way.
-Nice to meet you.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.648
We're gonna
help you figure this out, Caitlin.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.651
Let's get you to the lab.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.481
CAITLI N I <i>What's this?</i>

12:26.080 --> 12:28.765
<i>DR. TANNHAUSER: it's to test how your
ability affects molecular motion.</i>

12:29.080 --> 12:30.650
That shaft is solid tungsten,

12:30.840 --> 12:32.763
and it's heated to
over 2,000 degrees centigrade.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.291
<i>I want you to cool it down.</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:36.329
And when we determine how you can do that,

12:36.640 --> 12:38.290
<i>we can figure out
the best way to help you.</i>

12:38.520 --> 12:40.363
Best we could do in such little time.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.523
So, this is where
you've been for the last hour.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.162
Ihadto
reschedule my day for this, Caitlin.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.602
A lot of things around here
require my attention.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.921
I remember.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.371
Whenever you're ready.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.207
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

12:58.520 --> 13:00.602
(SIZZLING)

13:21.160 --> 13:22.571
Hey, Julian.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.367
You seen this?

13:24.560 --> 13:27.370
It's bad enough
we have the metas destroying the city.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.971
- Now we have this thing to worry about.
-Mmm-hmm.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.521
Is there any point in me asking
where you've been for the last hour?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.882
Or should I just assume
the rules still don't apply to you?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.566
I was, um...

13:36.560 --> 13:37.721
Yes, okay.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.570
Look. Hey, man, so I know that you and I,
we got off on the wrong foot.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.247
We never managed to find the right one,
and I'll take that.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.767
That's probably my fault,
but, um, I just...

13:48.920 --> 13:51.924
I don't want things
to be like that anymore, you know?

13:53.240 --> 13:54.571
I'd like it if things changed.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.888
It's funny, 'cause I remember you
saying something similar to that

13:57.080 --> 13:58.764
right before you stole
the case from underneath me.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.568
Do you have any idea
what it's like to work side by side

14:01.760 --> 14:03.683
with someone
with such little regard for the rules?

14:03.920 --> 14:06.082
You may very well
be contaminating my work.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.448
That's exactly why I wanna learn from you.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.681
I don't follow.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.566
You know, whenever I read your reports,

14:15.760 --> 14:19.970
it's clear that
your evidence collection techniques are

14:20.280 --> 14:21.770
far superior to mine.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.401
Go on.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.365
I don't know. I mean,
if I could just shadow you for a day,

14:29.560 --> 14:31.961
maybe ask a few questions,

14:32.440 --> 14:36.604
I think that you could really
help bring my skills up to snuff.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.086
<i>What do you say?</i>

14:40.640 --> 14:41.801
Sorry.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.971
What if I gave up the lab?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.885
There's a storeroom downstairs
that I could convert,

14:48.080 --> 14:51.766
so if you let me
follow you on this case, lab's yours.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.327
Lab's mine?

14:54.560 --> 14:58.121
Okay. Deal.
You can't slow me down, though.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.166
- I would never.
-All right. I'll call you.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.483
How long have you had these abilities?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.847
They started manifesting a few months ago,

15:10.160 --> 15:13.004
but I'm assuming I got them when
the particle accelerator exploded,

15:13.240 --> 15:14.321
just like all the other metas.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.847
- And you haven't told anyone?
-Just you.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.845
I told you, you never should have
taken that job at S.T.A.R. Labs.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.244
You could've stayed here,
had access to world-class facilities.

15:23.520 --> 15:27.081
And have all of my work
be in the shadow of your reputation.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.529
Of course, the only time
you need your mother

15:29.760 --> 15:30.841
is when you're in trouble.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.167
What's that supposed to mean?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.966
Oh, come on, darling.
You ran off to Central City

15:35.360 --> 15:37.601
to play scientist
with that disgraced quack.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.683
I was trying to make a name for myself.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.288
For three years, barely a word,
until trouble hits,

15:43.520 --> 15:46.046
and then here you come, walking through
the door and expecting Mommy

15:46.280 --> 15:48.044
to drop everything in her life
to try to fix it.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.801
- You have no idea what I've been through.
-(MACHINE TRILLING)

15:51.040 --> 15:52.883
Dr. Tannhauser, look at this.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.571
She's absorbed all that energy? How?

16:05.040 --> 16:07.042
I'm not sure yet,
but if we can figure that out,

16:07.320 --> 16:09.322
this could
change everything we're doing here.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.248
So then the Flash, my Flash again,
not your Flash, we hatched a plan

16:18.480 --> 16:22.883
to gather all the remaining meta-humans
into one place for a final showdown.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.242
They called it "World War M."
it was glorious.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.241
Two forces on opposing sides
of the stadium. The tension built.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.241
No. it was like that movie,
the gladiator was the lead gladiator.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.766
<i>What was that called?</i>

16:35.240 --> 16:36.401
<i>Gladiator.</i>

16:36.720 --> 16:39.610
That's better. On my Earth, it was
called Sweaty Men. That didn't take.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.411
<i>So, the two forces charge into battle,
and when they do--</i>

16:42.760 --> 16:44.603
- I need to take a five.
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.886
- Let's take a--
-By myself.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.844
Yeah, you go ahead.
I'll keep working on this.

16:54.560 --> 17:00.124
So, entry triple A, colon, two.
Plan is proceeding.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.601
Characters are in place.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.525
Nobody seems the wiser as to why I'm here.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.367
Hey-

17:11.560 --> 17:12.971
I had to give
a witness report on the attack,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.804
and I thought I would
make it a lunch date.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.963
Yeah, cool. I'll clear a spot.
Let's do this.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.281
- Yeah.
-(SIGHS)

17:19.599 --> 17:20.886
Are things any better with Julian?

17:21.079 --> 17:23.810
Oh, my God, it's like every time
I try to get to know the guy,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.041
he does something
that makes it really hard to.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.487
All I know now is
that he dislikes meta-humans

17:28.640 --> 17:30.085
about as much as he dislikes me.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.647
Maybe you should try
and see things from his perspective.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.404
He might have a reason
to dislike both of you

17:34.600 --> 17:35.806
that you don't know anything about.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.491
Did you just hit me with a Joe-ism?

17:37.760 --> 17:38.966
Well, sometimes he's right.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.446
- Sometimes he's not.
-Yeah.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.961
Speaking of which,
I just saw him downstairs,

17:43.280 --> 17:46.170
and he was talking to the DA.
He blew off a date with her.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.004
I saw him do the same thing last week.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.250
I don't know. Maybe he's not into her.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.807
No, he's into her.
I mean, when I asked him about her,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.081
he basically told me to buzz off.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.645
You're not too good at buzzing off,
are you?

17:55.840 --> 17:57.922
Nope. When it comes to my dad, no.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.482
(SIGHS) Well, look who it is.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.966
Looks like I have an opportunity

18:03.160 --> 18:05.686
to see things from Julian's perspective
right now.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.849
Sorry about lunch. I gotta go.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.170
See you later. I need that.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.287
If you don't stop squirming,
I'll never find a vein.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.648
What exactly are you testing for now?

18:17.840 --> 18:21.162
Any polymorphism that could help us
understand how you're able to absorb

18:21.360 --> 18:24.364
that much energy from molecules
to create gelid surroundings.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.683
You realize
I've run all of these tests already?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.524
Then, what was the point of coming here?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.046
Seriously, Mom?

18:30.880 --> 18:33.042
I'm terrified of what I'm becoming.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.882
You realize you haven't
asked me once how I'm feeling?

18:36.120 --> 18:38.327
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.966
Believe me, it's for your benefit
as much as it is mine.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.964
Right, because that's your specialty,
isn't it?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.889
Being cold, just like after...

18:45.200 --> 18:46.326
After what?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.565
After Dad died.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.890
I did everything I could
to save your father.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.050
Well, you lost your daughter
at the same time.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.326
You're the one who went away, Caitlin.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.567
Because I had to.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.686
You realize you never acted
like my mother again after Dad got sick?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.491
You barely even look at me.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.050
I couldn't handle the pain.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.411
My work got me through it.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.925
Losing someone like that.
You have no idea what that feels like.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.571
Actually, I do.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.525
My husband died over a year ago.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.561
I'm sorry.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.041
What do you got?

19:31.760 --> 19:35.242
I said get here quick,
but that was quicker than I expected.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.569
No, yeah, it was a crazy Uber driver.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.405
Well, the blast pattern
and the scoring on the insulation

19:42.600 --> 19:44.841
suggests that
it was a power surge that blew it out.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.441
So, it's a coincidence?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.445
I highly doubt it. But I'll figure it out.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.371
Someone in this city has to
do something about these metas.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.767
What do you mean?

19:54.040 --> 19:56.122
We have a whole police force
working to stop these metas.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.811
No, you have the Flash.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.361
So, it's not just bad metas
you don't like. It's all the metas.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.207
I'm just saying that because of him,
the police department has got lethargic.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.640
I mean, why do anything at all

20:08.880 --> 20:10.450
if the Flash is gonna
save the day every time?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.805
It's a bit like you with
the rule breaking. A momentary fix,

20:14.040 --> 20:15.804
and now you're lazy, sloppy.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.326
Cool. Thanks.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.486
Uh, I think the Flash is actually
a source of inspiration for the city.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.484
I think he kind of provides hope.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.969
Yes, that's one of many things that
we'll have to disagree on, Allen.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.323
What? Do you see something?

20:34.600 --> 20:39.003
A pattern. The creature's movements,
they seemed random at first,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.402
but they were contained
to a prescribed area.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.127
You know, like the creature was
stuck in an invisible fence.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.129
Traffic cameras were down, right?

20:47.320 --> 20:51.325
Maybe it was being watched
or controlled by somebody that

20:51.520 --> 20:53.648
needed to keep it

How? Triangulate!

31:46.360 --> 31:47.486
- BARRY: <i>Guys, which</i> way?
- Get the--

31:47.640 --> 31:48.880
All right, you take over.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.886
<i>CISCO: Found it.
It's at Second and Fulton.</i>

31:54.320 --> 31:55.401

32:03.560 --> 32:06.404
OFFICER 1: I have a <i>lock</i> on the target.
OFFICER 2: Fire when ready.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.605
Stop! Stop firing! It's a hologram!

32:23.040 --> 32:24.371
<i>OFFICER 2: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</i>

32:26.680 --> 32:28.284
OFFICER 1: <i>A</i> hologram?
OFFICER 3: Where'd <i>it</i> go?

32:29.280 --> 32:32.045
Detective West, where's Julian?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.526
He was here!

32:34.040 --> 32:35.371
Cisco, I need that location.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.201
Hamilton Building, 25th floor.
There's more power going there

32:39.400 --> 32:41.050
than anywhere else in
the building combined.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.491
Line of sight to all the attacks.
That's where he is.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.482
<i>JULIAN: I said put your hands up!</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:53.451
<i>This is C.C.P.D.! Freeze!</i>

32:53.960 --> 32:57.043
Stop what you're doing!
I said put your hands up!

33:03.600 --> 33:04.726
(PANTING)

33:05.080 --> 33:06.127
(BARRY GRUNTS)

33:09.320 --> 33:10.446
You're just a kid.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.244
Yeah, a kid you almost killed!

33:12.400 --> 33:13.811
You're gonna pay for that one, buddy.
You're gonna--

33:14.000 --> 33:15.570
Yeah, I don't think so, man.
I think you're the one

33:15.760 --> 33:17.922
that's gonna be paying for
all the damage you did to this city.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.924
For a very long time.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.287
(BOY GRUNTING)

33:24.080 --> 33:25.684
Hey, Flash.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.286
Thank you.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.525
You're welcome.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.841
Come on.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.371
Do you realize how many innocent people
could have been hurt, or worse?

33:44.680 --> 33:47.365
What made you do something like this?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.887
I just wanted
to feel powerful for a change.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.361
And that did it? Scaring people?

33:52.680 --> 33:55.047
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it did.

33:55.360 --> 33:59.684
You know, the kids at my school,
they tease me every day.

33:59.960 --> 34:04.284
I'm the weirdo there. And I'm just
sick of feeling scared all the time.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.848
I just wanted someone else
to feel that way for a change.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.005
Look“.

34:17.320 --> 34:21.291
I know sometimes
things are hard at your age.

34:24.159 --> 34:27.164
But trust me, it does get better.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.719
So, what happens now?

34:33.120 --> 34:34.884
Well, there are severe consequences
for what you did,

34:35.080 --> 34:37.321
and you're just gonna have to accept that.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.722
But listen, you're young.

34:41.639 --> 34:45.201
You can turn all of this around.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.123
All right. Come on.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.091
You were named
"Entrepreneur of the Decade"

34:58.320 --> 35:00.288
-by Tech Magazine?
-That's right.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.562
Is any of what's on here true?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.371
- All of it.
- CISCO: <i>How?</i>

35:04.600 --> 35:06.284
You can barely turn on a computer.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.328
There are two parts to every idea.
There is the inception and the execution.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.162
- I provide the former.
-So, you come up with the ideas?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.767
Yeah, I don't know how to implement them.
I'm the idea man.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.566
So you didn't actually solve
the cryptogram that we sent you?

35:19.800 --> 35:22.929
No, that was my partner
at S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.284
I'm the face of the company.
I'm more of the inspiration

35:27.520 --> 35:28.601
behind the company.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.490
Then I was exposed.
Well, people thought that I was

35:32.720 --> 35:35.246
something that I guess I wasn't.
Anyway, it...

35:35.600 --> 35:38.809
It kind of all fell apart for me.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.371
But then I got your message.
My partner brought me your message.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.927
I realized he's bringing me an opportunity

35:47.160 --> 35:49.970
to come to this Earth to write this book.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.767
So many planets in the multi-verse,
and we happen to pick

35:54.000 --> 35:57.288
the one Wells who's not a scientist.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.881
You're right.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.281
I wasn't completely honest with you,
with all of you.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.960
<i>I feel badly about that. I regret that.</i>

36:05.160 --> 36:07.686
But let me ask you a question.
Has there been none

36:07.880 --> 36:10.486
amongst you that has ever shaded the truth

36:10.680 --> 36:13.331
<i>for what you believe
to be the greater good?</i>

36:15.040 --> 36:17.611
-It sounds to me like you're a con man.
-Yeah.

36:17.800 --> 36:22.089
Was I a con man when I showed
San Francisco here how to track the beast

36:22.320 --> 36:25.164
using car alarms?
Was I a con man when I showed him how to

36:25.360 --> 36:26.964
fashion a rope using carbon fiber?

36:27.200 --> 36:30.488
- I came up with those ideas!
-You were prompted by my suggestions.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.720
That is how ideas work!
People, you need a muse!

36:35.120 --> 36:36.565
I can be your muse.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.525
What about stopping
all the metas on your Earth?

36:39.720 --> 36:43.281
More of an advisory role for me,
but I was there. I remembered how we--

36:43.480 --> 36:45.960
You don't think that's something?
Let me present you with a scenario.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.321
<i>You're confronted with something,</i>

36:47.520 --> 36:49.841
a threat that you've never seen before.
You don't know how to stop it.

36:50.040 --> 36:54.523
Who does? That's value to you.
Let me prove my worth to you.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.963
If I fail, I will... (IMITATES WHOOSHING)
Right back to my Earth,

36:58.160 --> 37:00.367
but if I succeed,
I will have succeeded not just

37:00.560 --> 37:03.370
in redeeming myself, but also,

37:03.720 --> 37:05.848
I will have done some good with my life.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.004
You know, you're lucky we're pretty big on

37:08.240 --> 37:11.767
redemption and doing good here,
so I think you can,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.526
I don't know, stay for a few weeks,
try to prove yourself,

37:14.720 --> 37:17.724
but if not... (IMITATES WHOOSHING)
Back to your Earth.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.291
Thank you.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.289
Hey, no more repackaging.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.561
Word is bond.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.485
That, just no more that.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.567
- All right, H.R.
-Okay.

37:33.480 --> 37:37.724
- Where you been?
-I actually went to visit my mother.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.647
Your mother? Oh, boy. Why?

37:43.320 --> 37:47.211
To see if we could work through
some of our issues.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.806
And I think we might actually
be on the road to recovery.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.689
When it comes to family,
you gotta do whatever it takes,

37:55.880 --> 37:59.805
'cause one day,
you might not be able to do that anymore.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.402
Glad you're back.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.610
This is home.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.204
<i>JULIAN: I nearly killed</i> a <i>kid tonight.</i>

38:23.480 --> 38:26.643
The monster we were chasing,
it turns out it was just a hologram

38:26.920 --> 38:29.207
<i>operated by a 15-year-old boy.</i>

38:30.440 --> 38:32.283
Flash came to save the day.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.687
And he saved me from doing something--

38:38.800 --> 38:41.644
- I heard.
-You know what's sad?

38:41.880 --> 38:45.930
That kid, he's just acting
'cause he's scared, you know?

38:46.120 --> 38:49.727
He wants everyone to be terrified
and to run away from the monster

38:49.920 --> 38:51.843
so he can feel powerful.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.007
- I know what that's like.
-How do you mean?

38:57.480 --> 39:01.121
I come from a pretty wealthy family
back in England.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.370
It's a long line of generations of
old money, tradition, nonsense, really,

39:07.560 --> 39:09.210
and I was the heir.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.767
I was their firstborn son.
I was supposed to inherit the lot.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.691
<i>But I was the odd duck</i>

39:14.880 --> 39:20.125
who would rather go in the garden
and collect samples of insects

39:21.400 --> 39:24.563
rather than learn how to tie

39:24.760 --> 39:26.000
a Windsor knot.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.170
Or which fork to use first at dinner.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.761
Yeah. No, I wanted more.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.644
You know?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.970
I came here to do the one thing
that they couldn't stop me from doing:

39:37.160 --> 39:40.562
becoming a scientist,
becoming a great scientist.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.889
Then just as I got to
the top of my field, poof!

39:45.440 --> 39:47.408
The world changes overnight.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.246
Meta-humans. I don't know
a single thing about meta-humans.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.841
I don't know how they talk.
I don't know how they walk.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.050
I certainly don't know
the first thing about stopping them, so

39:58.480 --> 40:01.450
rendered useless.
I suppose that's the monster

40:01.640 --> 40:05.929
that I'm running from now.
Just feeling powerless.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.091
Yeah, I feel the same way
some days, Julian.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.847
I lost my mom when I was a kid.
Lost my dad recently.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.849
<i>It's a scary world. People die.</i>

40:18.520 --> 40:20.921
Trusts are betrayed. Things change.

40:23.120 --> 40:26.841
Change can be a good thing, you know?
it can bring

40:27.040 --> 40:29.771
<i>new experiences,
new opportunities, people.</i>

40:31.040 --> 40:36.126
You can treat 'em like a potential enemy
or like a new friend.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.847
Just trust that everything's
gonna be okay.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.285
Yeah, maybe you're right.

You can stop.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.808
I was really wrong about the Flash,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.401
so I could be wrong about you, too.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.763
Good night, mate.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.486
Juhan?

41:09.120 --> 41:10.326

41:12.160 --> 41:14.003
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.531
All right.
