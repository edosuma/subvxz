00:56.717 --> 00:59.987
The secretary is so sorry, Mr. Ambassador.

00:59.988 --> 01:02.089
She was called away to a
meeting at the White House.

01:02.090 --> 01:03.257
Hmm, regarding the talks

01:03.258 --> 01:05.092
with Iran, no doubt.

01:05.093 --> 01:06.727
I hear there's a snag.

01:06.728 --> 01:07.962
Of course,

01:07.963 --> 01:09.230
you couldn't say, could you?

01:09.231 --> 01:10.531
She did want me to tell you

01:10.532 --> 01:12.867
that Canada is a very high priority.

01:12.868 --> 01:14.101
Ah.

01:14.102 --> 01:16.936
Very nice of her to say.

01:21.243 --> 01:23.778
What you're looking at, Mr.
President, is an act of war

01:23.779 --> 01:26.714
on the part of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.

01:26.715 --> 01:29.517
I'm looking at a building
that could be a Walmart.

01:29.518 --> 01:32.520
It's the heavy-water
production plant, sir.

01:32.521 --> 01:34.488
It's the same heavy-water
reactor the Iranians

01:34.489 --> 01:37.425
agreed to halt construction
on over a week ago.

01:37.426 --> 01:39.360
Sir, I've been negotiating.

01:39.361 --> 01:41.662
I'm getting nowhere with
these people here in Vienna

01:41.663 --> 01:43.264
for almost 18 months.

01:43.265 --> 01:45.733
Right now, if you ask me,
I need to go in that room

01:45.734 --> 01:47.535
and tell them the talking is over.

01:47.536 --> 01:48.803
What are you proposing, Allen?

01:48.804 --> 01:50.271
Well, sir, we have a squadron

01:50.272 --> 01:52.106
of F-18's on a carrier in the Gulf.

01:52.107 --> 01:55.276
They can be over that
thing in 40, 45 minutes.

01:55.277 --> 01:58.012
And then boom... you won't need a satellite

01:58.013 --> 01:59.413
to know that something's going on.

01:59.414 --> 02:02.450
Uh, so we're clear, as chief

02:02.451 --> 02:04.618
U.S. negotiator for the
Middle East peace talks,

02:04.619 --> 02:06.654
you are recommending

02:06.655 --> 02:08.189
a threat of military

02:08.190 --> 02:10.024
aggression against Iran.

02:10.025 --> 02:11.559
Correct.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.828
The trouble with a threat is

02:13.829 --> 02:16.497
you have to be ready to act on it.

02:16.498 --> 02:17.965
Elizabeth?

02:17.966 --> 02:19.567
Sir?

02:19.568 --> 02:21.068
You agree with Mr. Bollings?

02:21.069 --> 02:24.071
Well, he's-he's been

02:24.072 --> 02:25.606
in the room since day one, sir.

02:25.607 --> 02:27.942
Right. He was Secretary
Marsh's appointment.

02:27.943 --> 02:31.111
Under your advisement, Mr. President.

02:31.112 --> 02:32.913
Of course.

02:32.914 --> 02:35.682
But now I'd like to know what
my new secretary of state thinks.

02:39.955 --> 02:43.424
Wasn't there some discussion
that if the Iranians

02:43.425 --> 02:45.192
shut down this particular reactor

02:45.193 --> 02:47.962
on schedule, we would give
them something in return?

02:47.963 --> 02:51.031
We did discuss lifting
the ban on airplane parts.

02:51.032 --> 02:55.069
Right, because we haven't given
them any new parts or planes

02:55.070 --> 02:56.504
since the Revolution.

02:56.505 --> 02:58.072
Maybe it's time to put that on the table.

02:58.073 --> 03:00.374
You can't reward this kind of action...

03:00.375 --> 03:02.276
No. It's not a reward

03:02.277 --> 03:05.312
if you also stipulate they
have to allow inspectors.

03:05.313 --> 03:07.114
To make sure that that thing is turned off

03:07.115 --> 03:08.482
when they say it's turned off.

03:08.483 --> 03:12.186
Something the Iranians have
refused to do up until now.

03:12.187 --> 03:14.620
Carrot and stick.

03:15.756 --> 03:17.625
I like it.

03:17.626 --> 03:19.960
Do you think you could
make that work, Allen?

03:19.961 --> 03:23.163
Well, I can try, sir.

03:23.164 --> 03:24.632
If you both think it will work.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.867
I do.

03:26.868 --> 03:29.303
And it had better.

03:29.304 --> 03:32.806
Otherwise...

03:32.807 --> 03:35.643
There's no way Iran gets a
nuclear weapon on my watch.

03:35.644 --> 03:37.912
Otherwise, it's war.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.614
So, we're going with the peace talks

03:40.615 --> 03:43.083
in Vienna with Iran are continuing.

03:43.084 --> 03:44.518
And we continue to look for progress.

03:44.519 --> 03:46.487
Well, we can't say continue
twice... it sounds desperate.

03:46.488 --> 03:47.955
Just keep it short and simple.

03:47.956 --> 03:49.256
- Nothing to sound the alarms.
- Right.

03:49.257 --> 03:52.259
We've given them 48 hours
to shut down the reactor.

03:52.260 --> 03:53.494
After that, say a prayer

03:53.495 --> 03:57.131
to whatever God you
pray to by whatever name.

03:57.132 --> 03:58.799
Sorry.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.634
Did I just bring the mood down?

04:00.635 --> 04:02.423
You're in good hands
with Mr. Bollings, ma'am.

04:02.424 --> 04:04.397
- Really?
- As a U.S. Special Envoy,

04:04.398 --> 04:06.540
he negotiated the settlement
in Northern Ireland.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.576
- Brought about the cease-fire in Kosovo.
- Yeah.

04:08.577 --> 04:10.044
And he's rumored to be on the short list

04:10.045 --> 04:11.145
for a Nobel Prize.

04:11.146 --> 04:13.814
So I've heard. A lot.

04:13.815 --> 04:15.349
Why are you all out here?

04:15.350 --> 04:16.416
The Honorable

04:16.418 --> 04:18.017
Lester Clark, Ambassador of Canada,

04:18.019 --> 04:19.286
is still in your office.

04:19.286 --> 04:20.321
Holy crap!

04:20.322 --> 04:21.654
Which is not soundproof.

04:21.656 --> 04:23.290
Damn it.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.658
Is he mad?

04:24.659 --> 04:26.727
In a Canadian kind of way.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.031
Is this about that
explosion on the pipeline?

04:31.032 --> 04:32.766
- It's probably about the party.
- Which party?

04:32.767 --> 04:34.735
The reception Canada's throwing
for her at their embassy

04:34.736 --> 04:36.337
this weekend, welcoming her to her new job.

04:36.338 --> 04:37.938
Oh, wait, not everybody made the list.

04:37.939 --> 04:39.106
The meeting could be about both.

04:39.107 --> 04:40.541
And not to worry, we're all on the list.

04:40.542 --> 04:41.809
And we're all plus one.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.243
You guys bringing Callie and Winthrop?

04:43.244 --> 04:44.578
- Carly.
- He prefers Win.

04:44.579 --> 04:45.679
Whatever. Just let me know

04:45.680 --> 04:46.981
so I can put their names on the list.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.382
Are you bringing a date, Blake?

04:48.383 --> 04:49.750
- Yes.
- Anybody we know?

04:49.751 --> 04:50.918
Not yet.

04:50.919 --> 04:52.653
He never identifies a gender.

04:52.654 --> 04:53.954
It's rude to ask, too, right?

04:53.955 --> 04:55.856
He knows... about us.

04:55.857 --> 04:57.424
He does not. Every time this happens,

04:57.425 --> 04:58.759
you think everybody knows.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.995
This does not happen enough
times to create a ratio.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.229
Last night was an aberration.

05:02.230 --> 05:04.665
Yes. Our sixth aberration?

05:04.666 --> 05:05.966
Best to date in my opinion.

05:05.967 --> 05:07.801
Look, it only happens when
we work late under pressure

05:07.802 --> 05:10.104
and someone says... I admit, usually me...

05:10.105 --> 05:11.505
"A tequila shot couldn't hurt."

05:11.506 --> 05:13.289
So we have to not do that anymore.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.042
Because I'm with Win
and you're with Callie.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.744
- Carly.
- These episodes are dishonest

05:16.745 --> 05:17.745
and weak.

05:17.746 --> 05:19.580
And fun.

05:19.581 --> 05:21.515
But mostly dishonest and weak.

05:21.516 --> 05:22.483
Look, I mean it.

05:22.484 --> 05:25.085
Last night was the absolute last time.

05:25.086 --> 05:27.954
Absolutely.

05:37.665 --> 05:39.900
It's clearly an act of Eco-terrorism

05:39.901 --> 05:41.335
aimed at stopping the building

05:41.336 --> 05:42.936
of a link between our two countries.

05:42.937 --> 05:44.152
Well, whatever it was, it happened

05:44.153 --> 05:47.775
on Canadian soil... or
Canadian arctic tundra.

05:47.776 --> 05:49.276
Forgive me.

05:49.277 --> 05:51.512
But it's subarctic taiga.

05:51.513 --> 05:54.548
It isn't tundra unless there's permafrost.

05:54.549 --> 05:57.117
My mistake.

05:57.118 --> 05:59.486
But until we know the
motives and nationality

05:59.487 --> 06:00.988
of the people responsible,

06:00.989 --> 06:02.990
we can't say what it...

06:02.991 --> 06:05.492
clearly is or isn't.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.327
Madam Secretary?

06:07.328 --> 06:09.496
My government has been very clear

06:09.497 --> 06:11.465
about its commitment to this pipeline.

06:11.466 --> 06:12.733
Can you say the same?

06:12.734 --> 06:15.569
No, not until you make it
clear why you're asking.

06:15.570 --> 06:18.038
Well, the State Department...
your State Department...

06:18.039 --> 06:19.907
is sitting on a report.

06:19.908 --> 06:21.709
The Environmental Impact

06:21.710 --> 06:23.010
Assessment of the Pipeline.

06:23.011 --> 06:24.611
I haven't had a chance to review that.

06:24.612 --> 06:26.113
It was prepared under my predecessor.

06:26.114 --> 06:27.247
Yes. Secretary Marsh

06:27.248 --> 06:30.584
assured me last time
we talked in this office

06:30.585 --> 06:33.721
that its conclusions would be favorable.

06:33.722 --> 06:35.355
Look...

06:35.356 --> 06:37.858
the longer you withhold this report,

06:37.859 --> 06:40.360
the more hope you give these bomb-throwers

06:40.361 --> 06:42.329
and Eco-activists that
they can pressure you

06:42.330 --> 06:43.964
into killing the pipeline.

06:43.965 --> 06:45.299
Is that what you want?

06:45.300 --> 06:46.934
Wow. I-I-I don't know

06:46.935 --> 06:49.770
which fallacy to start with.

06:49.771 --> 06:52.673
Allow me to rephrase.

06:52.674 --> 06:54.174
I want your word

06:54.175 --> 06:56.777
that you will make it a priority

06:56.778 --> 06:59.211
to release the report on the pipeline.

07:00.581 --> 07:02.816
Yes. To read...

07:02.817 --> 07:04.752
and release. You have my word.

07:04.753 --> 07:06.453
There should be no misunderstanding

07:06.454 --> 07:08.622
- between friends.
- Well, I agree.

07:08.623 --> 07:10.057
Friends should have parties.

07:10.058 --> 07:12.126
Like the one you're
throwing me Friday night.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.260
Thank you again by the way.

07:13.261 --> 07:14.762
You're most welcome.

07:14.763 --> 07:16.797
Our two countries have always found a way

07:16.798 --> 07:19.500
to work out our differences amicably.

07:19.501 --> 07:23.370
Right. I mean, at least
since the War of 1812.

07:23.371 --> 07:24.705
Not to bring up a touchy subject.

07:24.706 --> 07:26.140
And why would it be touchy?

07:26.141 --> 07:29.109
Well... we won.

07:30.578 --> 07:32.146
Madam Secretary?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.081
The War of 1812

07:34.082 --> 07:36.583
was a draw.

07:40.454 --> 07:42.723
We're looking at a live
feed now of the palace

07:42.724 --> 07:44.792
where representatives of
the United States and Iran

07:44.793 --> 07:47.194
are resuming talks on nuclear disarm...

07:47.195 --> 07:48.796
Something smells really good!

07:48.797 --> 07:51.031
Mom, what's really happening?

07:51.032 --> 07:53.867
When will you get the part that
she can't talk about her work?

07:53.868 --> 07:54.835
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

07:54.836 --> 07:57.204
It's chicken chili this
time. And cornbread.

07:57.205 --> 07:59.273
- It tastes pretty good.
- Wow! Yum.

07:59.274 --> 08:01.275
We get no heads-up on nuclear war?

08:01.276 --> 08:03.177
Listen, all you need to
know is that your government

08:03.178 --> 08:05.746
is doing everything to keep you safe.

08:05.747 --> 08:08.048
Yeah, even if it means nuking someone else.

08:08.049 --> 08:09.743
Hey, cut it out. Nobody's getting nuked.

08:09.744 --> 08:10.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:10.418 --> 08:12.352
How can you absolutely know that?

08:12.353 --> 08:14.555
You can't absolutely know that.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.023
Look. Come here.

08:16.024 --> 08:19.293
There was a time when nuclear war was

08:19.294 --> 08:21.495
a much bigger possibility
and it didn't happen then.

08:21.496 --> 08:23.230
When was that?

08:23.231 --> 08:26.266
Well, back when your dad and I were young

08:26.267 --> 08:28.494
and dinosaurs roamed the earth.

08:28.495 --> 08:30.070
Yeah, you know, like, before the Internet.

08:30.071 --> 08:32.172
Okay, somebody tell Mom about their day.

08:32.173 --> 08:33.407
And make it good.

08:33.408 --> 08:35.808
Why don't you tell Mom about your day?

08:35.809 --> 08:37.177
- Oh, no.
- Mom?

08:37.178 --> 08:38.879
- What?
- Did you know

08:38.880 --> 08:41.114
that today Dad also made the news?

08:41.115 --> 08:42.883
- Don't tell her everything.
- Come on, Dad!

08:42.884 --> 08:44.183
No, no, no! What happened?

08:44.184 --> 08:45.152
Apparently...

08:45.153 --> 08:46.954
I made some list of famous spouses.

08:46.955 --> 08:48.255
Uh, prettiest spouses.

08:48.256 --> 08:50.557
TMI Magazine's list of The Arm Candy.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.759
Top Ten: U.S. Government Edition.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.229
- Get out!
- Dad is number three.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.663
Well...

08:56.664 --> 08:58.198
Who's one and two?

08:58.199 --> 09:00.467
Oh, they're both women and
they're both former supermodels.

09:00.468 --> 09:02.336
Yeah, just so you know where
the country's priorities lie.

09:02.337 --> 09:03.637
Aw, I think it's adorable.

09:03.638 --> 09:06.506
All right, that was a very good start.

09:06.507 --> 09:07.872
More. I need more good news.

09:07.873 --> 09:09.543
I got assigned the world's stupidest report

09:09.544 --> 09:11.478
- in English class today.
- Oh, come on.

09:11.479 --> 09:13.847
- Which I am totally psyched about.
- And I'm dying to hear about.

09:13.848 --> 09:15.849
- What is it?
- I have to interview a parent or caregiver

09:15.850 --> 09:17.551
about their lives. It's a 500-word essay

09:17.552 --> 09:18.585
about their occupation.

09:18.586 --> 09:20.287
What they like and don't like about it.

09:20.288 --> 09:22.890
The teacher is obviously angling
for me to write about you, Mom.

09:22.891 --> 09:25.459
- Of course.
- That's why I'm writing about Dad.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.361
Mr. Arm Candy.

09:31.732 --> 09:34.334
I'm telling you it's not just rebellion.

09:34.335 --> 09:36.103
Honey, it is.

09:36.104 --> 09:38.472
He's not interested in the
life of a religious scholar.

09:38.473 --> 09:40.741
No, but you were a Marine Corps pilot.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.943
And you guys can talk about cool

09:42.944 --> 09:45.312
fighter jets and stuff like that.

09:45.313 --> 09:47.414
Come on, he's an anarchist.

09:47.415 --> 09:49.182
He's not interested in my military history.

09:49.183 --> 09:50.550
Oh.

09:50.551 --> 09:52.920
Without government institutions,

09:52.921 --> 09:55.489
what would the anarchists
have to anarchy about?

10:04.264 --> 10:07.067
Hello? Yeah, put her through. Thanks.

10:07.068 --> 10:10.304
Seized when?

10:10.305 --> 10:12.739
Blockaded? No, um...

10:12.740 --> 10:15.574
I'll be right in. Thank you.

10:21.214 --> 10:22.716
We're at war with Iran?

10:22.717 --> 10:25.084
No. With Canada.

10:28.255 --> 10:31.591
These are a few fishing
boats, Madam Secretary.

10:31.592 --> 10:32.960
These are American boats,

10:32.961 --> 10:35.562
boarded and seized.

10:35.563 --> 10:37.664
Uh, the salmon, I believe, are Canadian.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.833
It's a clear violation

10:39.834 --> 10:42.035
of the 2009 revision

10:42.036 --> 10:43.570
to the Pacific Fisheries Treaty

10:43.571 --> 10:44.938
of 1985.

10:44.939 --> 10:46.873
This is simple enforcement.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.275
You're trying to strong-arm me

10:48.276 --> 10:49.776
into releasing the pipeline report.

10:49.777 --> 10:50.811
I'm sorry

10:50.812 --> 10:52.079
you feel that way.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.481
What if instead of releasing the report,

10:54.482 --> 10:57.417
I canceled the Level P-1
temporary athletic visas

10:57.418 --> 10:59.786
of every Canadian national in the NHL?

10:59.787 --> 11:01.588
For violations

11:01.589 --> 11:03.991
to Section 101 of the Immigration

11:03.992 --> 11:06.159
and Nationality Act of 1965?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.894
Simple enforcement.

11:07.895 --> 11:11.431
Hockey season starts soon.

11:11.432 --> 11:13.834
That'll be a short season.

11:13.835 --> 11:15.258
I'm sure you wouldn't stoop to that.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.352
And I was sure that in
the face of our trying

11:17.353 --> 11:19.273
to avoid military escalation with Iran,

11:19.274 --> 11:20.798
you wouldn't stoop to this.

11:20.799 --> 11:22.317
I repeat, Madam Secretary,

11:22.318 --> 11:24.714
it's a clear violation
of the Fisheries Treaty.

11:24.715 --> 11:25.445
You know what?

11:25.446 --> 11:26.813
You're right.

11:26.814 --> 11:29.481
Let's get the president in on this.

11:31.651 --> 11:33.186
Secretary McCord for President Dalton.

11:33.187 --> 11:37.424
What do I get out of this, Madam Secretary,

11:37.425 --> 11:38.792
if I release the boats?

11:38.793 --> 11:41.161
You get to not find
yourself on the business end

11:41.162 --> 11:44.664
of a midnight call with
President Dalton about salmon.

11:44.665 --> 11:45.699
Do you want to wake him?

11:45.700 --> 11:49.202
I don't know, Lester. Do I?

11:49.203 --> 11:50.737
Your boats will be released.

11:50.738 --> 11:51.838
Thank you.

11:51.839 --> 11:53.040
Cancel the call.

11:53.041 --> 11:56.009
And I will read and release the report.

11:56.010 --> 11:56.873
When I'm ready.

11:56.874 --> 11:58.232
Well, this is not the last you've heard

11:58.233 --> 11:59.880
on the matter, Madam Secretary.

11:59.881 --> 12:01.381
I believe you, Lester.

12:01.382 --> 12:02.449
Good night.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.454
Who'd you call?

12:07.455 --> 12:09.022
My sister.

12:09.023 --> 12:11.390
She's used to it.

12:15.195 --> 12:16.763
I try to lecture so the students

12:16.764 --> 12:19.666
grasp the organization of what I'm saying,

12:19.667 --> 12:21.435
see the way the subject is laid out.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.571
So that later they can
see the whole pattern.

12:24.572 --> 12:26.073
Understand it and retain it.

12:26.074 --> 12:27.374
Right.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.476
Okay, so did you always
want to be a teacher?

12:29.477 --> 12:32.312
No, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

12:32.313 --> 12:33.680
Except go to college.

12:33.681 --> 12:36.149
Which for me wasn't really an option,

12:36.150 --> 12:38.532
unless I figured out a
way to pay for it myself.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.421
That's how I wound up in the ROTC,

12:40.422 --> 12:42.556
and that's why I joined
the Marine Corps Air Wing.

12:42.557 --> 12:44.624
Wait. Wait...

12:44.625 --> 12:46.860
s-so you, like, didn't even
care about flying planes?

12:46.861 --> 12:48.361
No, of course I did.

12:48.362 --> 12:49.396
What, are you nuts?

12:49.397 --> 12:51.531
I always wanted to fly a plane.

12:51.532 --> 12:53.100
It took me five years of active duty

12:53.101 --> 12:55.135
to get in the cockpit, but I did it.

12:55.136 --> 12:56.670
Okay.

12:56.671 --> 12:58.405
So, you flew some planes.

12:58.406 --> 13:01.341
And then you left because
you decided to teach religion?

13:01.342 --> 13:03.376
Well, the transition was

13:03.377 --> 13:05.112
a little more complicated than that.

13:05.113 --> 13:06.513
Mom's on TV.

13:06.514 --> 13:08.148
30 years of mutual mistrust

13:08.149 --> 13:10.350
cannot be resolved overnight.

13:10.351 --> 13:12.919
But there has been tangible
progress on key issues,

13:12.920 --> 13:14.620
so, thank you.

13:15.755 --> 13:17.824
- Eric.
- How do you respond to reports

13:17.825 --> 13:19.226
the Iranian president's visit

13:19.227 --> 13:20.760
to the White House may be postponed,

13:20.761 --> 13:22.195
even canceled?

13:22.196 --> 13:25.065
I see no indication of
that happening at this time.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.533
The visit in itself

13:26.534 --> 13:29.703
is a significant step. I
mean, you have to remember that

13:29.704 --> 13:32.172
formal diplomatic relations
between our countries

13:32.173 --> 13:34.474
ended in 1980.

13:34.475 --> 13:37.677
President Shiraz will be
the first Iranian leader

13:37.678 --> 13:39.212
to visit Washington since that time.

13:39.213 --> 13:41.914
Yeah, that is if we don't go to war.

13:45.285 --> 13:46.820
It's okay, honey.

13:46.821 --> 13:48.560
That was great. Just spot on.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.489
- Professional.
- Good.

13:49.490 --> 13:52.926
Just one observation... it's
more of a note than a criticism...

13:52.927 --> 13:55.495
your voice gets a little
breathy when you lie.

13:55.496 --> 13:57.497
But... I WA... I was not lying.

13:57.498 --> 13:58.865
I meant "obfuscate."

13:58.866 --> 14:00.534
I was reassuring.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.969
Your voice gets breathy
when you're reassuring.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.138
And doing a very good job

14:05.139 --> 14:07.417
- reassuring.
- Mr. Jackson asked for a moment

14:07.418 --> 14:09.910
- of your time. Here he is.
- Mm. I see that. Thank you.

14:09.911 --> 14:12.879
Seriously, nice deflection in there.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.015
- You're getting the hang of this.
- Are you telling me I'm

14:15.016 --> 14:17.317
- shrinking into the role?
- Except I hear you found

14:17.318 --> 14:19.486
a way to offend the Canadians.
How'd you manage that?

14:19.487 --> 14:20.654
The situation

14:20.655 --> 14:22.589
with Canada is being managed.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.424
Is it? I don't know if you've noticed,

14:24.425 --> 14:26.359
but you're getting all sorts of attention.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.962
They're right outside your building.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.202
The longer you hold off on this

14:35.203 --> 14:37.470
environmental permit
report, the more of a story

14:37.471 --> 14:38.572
it becomes.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.540
Yeah, the Canadians made the same threat.

14:40.541 --> 14:43.944
- Point. Of course I meant "point."
- Well, the Canadians are right.

14:43.945 --> 14:45.212
Release it.

14:45.213 --> 14:47.814
Give the president the
excuse he needs to approve it

14:47.815 --> 14:50.417
and get this whole Canadian
pipeline off his plate.

14:50.418 --> 14:52.819
I've been a little busy
trying to avoid war with Iran.

14:53.850 --> 14:56.456
The pipeline report is
a thousand-page document.

14:56.457 --> 14:58.690
You need to read it?

14:59.759 --> 15:01.528
Of course you do.

15:01.529 --> 15:02.796
So read it,

15:02.797 --> 15:03.997
then sign off.

15:03.998 --> 15:05.998
You got a day.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.202
That's less time than we gave the Iranians.

15:09.203 --> 15:11.870
Sometimes you got to walk and chew gum.

15:17.411 --> 15:18.945
Futile

15:18.946 --> 15:21.106
and aggressive attempt...

15:26.052 --> 15:27.520
...by a so-called superpower

15:27.521 --> 15:30.457
in its decline to impose its
will on a sovereign people.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.725
Just tell him I want a simple yes or no.

15:36.463 --> 15:38.530
No.

15:51.345 --> 15:54.080
Madam Secretary, Mr.
Jackson is asking to see you.

15:54.081 --> 15:56.850
Already? He wants an update
on the pipeline report?

15:56.851 --> 16:00.320
I... You can tell him
this: I'm on page 411 and

16:00.321 --> 16:02.522
I have real problems with
it. Have you read this?

16:02.523 --> 16:04.957
Uh, no one has, ma'am.

16:05.558 --> 16:07.294
Except the people who wrote it.

16:07.295 --> 16:08.595
Well, who did write it?

16:08.596 --> 16:10.964
I will find that out for you.

16:10.965 --> 16:14.034
Um, Mr. Jackson is calling
about something else.

16:14.035 --> 16:15.902
The talks in Vienna have adjourned

16:15.903 --> 16:17.971
and you're wanted right
away at the White House.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.025
I don't understand.

16:22.026 --> 16:23.410
Bollings didn't make the airplane offer?

16:23.411 --> 16:25.211
He said he tried but it was too late.

16:25.212 --> 16:26.846
They were so outraged by the notion

16:26.847 --> 16:28.511
of foreign inspectors
on the ground, he Nev...

16:28.512 --> 16:29.149
He wasn't supposed

16:29.150 --> 16:31.275
to lead with that. It's
the carrot before the stick.

16:31.276 --> 16:32.519
I'm just relaying what he said.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.187
Mr. President, I'm having real questions

16:34.188 --> 16:36.256
about how Allen is doing his job.

16:36.257 --> 16:37.590
Then ask him the questions

16:37.591 --> 16:38.992
and get those questions answered.

16:38.993 --> 16:40.393
These are your peace talks now.

16:40.394 --> 16:42.662
If it all gets kicked back
to me, what are you here for?

16:42.663 --> 16:44.731
This is what State does. I want to know

16:44.732 --> 16:46.666
why I don't give the order now. Today.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.301
Blow Hekmat off the face of the earth.

16:48.302 --> 16:50.737
Put an end to the Iranians' equivocation.

16:50.738 --> 16:53.340
Sir, you do that... you
even threaten to do that...

16:53.341 --> 16:54.641
that's the end of the talks.

16:54.642 --> 16:57.043
I mean, sure, you might set
back their weapons development

16:57.044 --> 16:59.346
six months... maybe a year at most...

16:59.347 --> 17:02.048
but you'll have convinced
them to go full bore.

17:02.049 --> 17:04.117
They'll take their reactors,
stockpiles, everything

17:04.117 --> 17:06.519
underground where we can't
detect it, we can't get at it.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.320
When we bomb them with bigger bombs,

17:08.321 --> 17:11.156
again and again and again.

17:11.157 --> 17:13.593
And the joke of it, sir...

17:13.594 --> 17:15.662
is that this is exactly
what the militants want.

17:15.663 --> 17:18.464
This is not what I need from you.

17:18.465 --> 17:20.266
What do you need, sir?

17:20.267 --> 17:21.233
For you to fix this.

17:21.234 --> 17:24.102
Have I been unclear about that?

17:25.771 --> 17:27.107
Sir, in fairness, she, uh,

17:27.108 --> 17:29.476
she inherited a lot of this,

17:29.477 --> 17:30.944
including Allen Bollings.

17:30.945 --> 17:34.379
- This was Marsh's agenda.
- Vincent Marsh is dead.

17:35.482 --> 17:37.382
When are you gonna do your job?

17:45.735 --> 17:53.560
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

17:59.687 --> 18:03.140
Sometimes I think it's better
when two people can just

18:03.141 --> 18:05.409
- talk, one-on-one.
- I think I understand you,

18:05.410 --> 18:06.477
Madam Secretary.

18:06.478 --> 18:08.613
Let's hope so.

18:08.614 --> 18:10.381
I've just sent you a photograph.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.917
Zahed Javani.

18:12.918 --> 18:14.285
He's their former UN ambassador.

18:14.286 --> 18:17.021
Yeah. He's just joined the talks.

18:17.022 --> 18:18.623
Oh, so I've heard.

18:18.624 --> 18:21.726
Their story is he's just
there as an observer.

18:21.727 --> 18:24.128
There's another story that he used his time

18:24.129 --> 18:25.663
at the UN well, taking advantage

18:25.664 --> 18:27.999
of the fact that it's the one place

18:28.000 --> 18:31.102
he can legally speak to
Americans on American soil.

18:31.103 --> 18:33.404
He's rumored after this
to be on his way to Tehran

18:33.405 --> 18:34.739
to be the new foreign minister.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.674
So I've heard.

18:36.675 --> 18:39.209
It's not my first time
dealing with these people.

18:40.778 --> 18:42.847
I think you can talk to him.

18:42.848 --> 18:44.682
What do you mean? One-on-one?

18:44.683 --> 18:47.418
A take-aside, where the others can't hear.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.120
And then, if you repeat our offer...

18:49.121 --> 18:52.623
airplane parts and inspectors
for a chance to be a part again

18:52.624 --> 18:55.359
of the civilized world... he might actually

18:55.360 --> 18:58.229
be ready to listen and do something.

18:58.230 --> 18:59.997
And what makes you think it will work?

18:59.998 --> 19:01.999
Oh, based on my read of him.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.267
I'm pretty good at reading people.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.769
You can ask around.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.071
Well, it's worth a try.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.640
Good luck.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.212
Madam Secretary.

19:15.213 --> 19:16.747
You wanted to meet with the people

19:16.748 --> 19:18.049
who wrote the pipeline report?

19:18.050 --> 19:20.984
Oh. Yeah.

19:23.688 --> 19:24.922
Oh. Wh-Whoa.

19:24.923 --> 19:26.223
Hey, what the hell happened?

19:26.224 --> 19:27.425
- Nothing.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.

19:27.426 --> 19:29.193
A little encounter with a protester.

19:29.194 --> 19:30.761
Matt had to engage in a debate.

19:30.762 --> 19:32.997
Look, he started by
claiming that the pipeline

19:32.998 --> 19:34.598
would add CO2 to the atmosphere,

19:34.599 --> 19:36.233
so I had to tell him that it's

19:36.234 --> 19:38.469
nothing compared to the trucks
and tanker cars we'd need

19:38.470 --> 19:39.837
if we didn't have the pipeline.

19:39.838 --> 19:41.539
And anyway, oil from Canada

19:41.540 --> 19:43.251
could potentially supply America's energy

19:43.252 --> 19:45.404
- for the next 30 years.
- And then he sludged you?

19:45.405 --> 19:48.145
No, no. He had a few more comments to add.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.615
Yeah. Yeah, I pointed out to him
that his T-shirt was misspelled.

19:51.616 --> 19:53.584
You know? "Greenhouse gases"
doesn't have a double "S"

19:53.585 --> 19:55.086
It's one "S."

19:55.087 --> 19:56.487
I might have sludged you for that.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.922
Get cleaned up.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.192
She's right.

20:01.193 --> 20:03.894
Correcting people's grammar
and spelling is so annoying.

20:03.895 --> 20:05.529
- Do you do it to Carly?
- You know what?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.365
I don't do anything to Carly anymore.

20:07.366 --> 20:08.899
We broke up.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.301
Since when?

20:12.303 --> 20:14.704
Yesterday.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.508
Not because of me.

20:17.509 --> 20:20.144
Of course not.

20:20.145 --> 20:22.012
- We had issues.
- What kind of issues?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.931
- I corrected her spelling.
- Tell me you did not

20:23.932 --> 20:25.649
break up with her because
you want to keep having...

20:25.650 --> 20:27.051
What? Aberrations?

20:27.052 --> 20:28.718
With me.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.089
How you guys doing?

20:32.090 --> 20:34.258
That is...

20:34.259 --> 20:36.527
not why I broke up with her.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.494
I don't believe you.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.065
Oh, that's... that's nice.

20:41.066 --> 20:43.000
That's really...

20:43.001 --> 20:44.702
really nice.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.203
No meta-analysis.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.806
Tables and statistics
that are out-of-date

20:48.807 --> 20:50.775
or-or just plain irrelevant.

20:50.776 --> 20:52.843
Right here... there's an entire section

20:52.844 --> 20:55.312
in here that seems lifted
from somewhere else,

20:55.313 --> 20:56.881
talking about the effects

20:56.882 --> 20:59.183
of fracking in the Everglades.

20:59.184 --> 21:00.885
In Florida.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.319
Who did this research?

21:02.320 --> 21:04.789
Secretary Marsh contracted
out to an independent firm.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.522
And then what?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.560
Bruce and I both took a pass at it.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.329
And neither one of you raised
an eyebrow at the content?

21:12.330 --> 21:14.210
We were tasked with
languaging, Madam Secretary.

21:15.467 --> 21:16.867
That's nice verbing, Bruce.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.702
I was looking for a yes or no.

21:18.703 --> 21:19.837
Come on, you guys.

21:19.838 --> 21:22.973
This reads like it was
written by an oil lobbyist.

21:22.974 --> 21:26.209
What was the name of the independent firm?

21:26.844 --> 21:28.746
The Cathcart Group.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.849
It was written by an oil lobbyist.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.751
The biggest one on K Street, in fact.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.920
I think that's enough for now.

21:35.921 --> 21:38.521
Thank you both for coming in.

21:43.727 --> 21:45.396
I know what you're thinking.

21:45.397 --> 21:46.964
That Secretary Marsh commissioned

21:46.965 --> 21:49.667
an oil lobby to create fake reports

21:49.668 --> 21:51.368
so we could rush the pipeline through?

21:51.369 --> 21:52.970
It looks bad... I know.

21:52.971 --> 21:54.638
He made no secret of being a friend

21:54.639 --> 21:56.774
- to the oil companies.
- Nadine, it is bad.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.743
They were some of his biggest
contributors to his campaign.

21:59.744 --> 22:01.846
But he wasn't in anyone's pocket.

22:01.847 --> 22:04.114
You have to believe that.

22:04.115 --> 22:07.751
He was for energy independence,
as is the president.

22:07.752 --> 22:09.086
This report

22:09.087 --> 22:12.356
says exactly what the
White House wants it to say.

22:12.357 --> 22:14.692
Jackson told you as much.

22:14.693 --> 22:17.495
I know.

22:17.496 --> 22:22.031
But I can't put my name
on a falsified document.

22:24.401 --> 22:27.872
Mr. Jackson also gave you a day.

22:27.873 --> 22:31.809
Starting over on this
report would take six months.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.979
Are you really ready to
tell that to the president?

22:34.980 --> 22:38.716
I just got a call from Vienna.
The Iranians walked out.

22:38.717 --> 22:39.505
They've adjourned?

22:39.506 --> 22:41.519
No, walked out, as in
they've ended the talks.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.981
Packing up and leaving. Allen
Bollings is getting on a plane.

22:43.982 --> 22:45.117
There's going to be a full briefing

22:45.118 --> 22:47.591
at the White House as
soon as he touches down.

22:47.592 --> 22:49.493
All right,

22:49.494 --> 22:50.628
- think about this.
- Mm-hmm.

22:50.629 --> 22:52.663
You admire people who protest, correct?

22:52.664 --> 22:53.797
- Mm-hmm.
- The right to dissent.

22:53.798 --> 22:55.499
Well, in my work, I get to teach

22:55.500 --> 22:57.635
and learn about the greatest,
most articulate protesters

22:57.636 --> 22:59.703
in the history of mankind.

22:59.704 --> 23:01.839
Martin Luther, for example.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.641
The leader of the Protestant Reformation.

23:03.642 --> 23:04.875
The original protestors.

23:04.876 --> 23:06.243
Yes, I've heard you say that.

23:06.244 --> 23:07.711
Okay, well, there's others.

23:07.712 --> 23:10.447
There's Ignatius of Loyola,
Joan of Arc, Blaise Pascal.

23:10.448 --> 23:13.684
These people were not
exactly rule followers.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.653
Mm-hmm, right.

23:15.654 --> 23:18.956
Oh, wow. Okay.

23:18.957 --> 23:21.025
Listen, buddy, you should
just write about Mom.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.793
I totally get it, I understand.

23:22.794 --> 23:24.194
It's not gonna hurt my feelings.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.096
No, no. It's too late. It's due tomorrow.

23:26.097 --> 23:29.195
- Oh. Really?
- No. I didn't mean it like that.

23:29.196 --> 23:30.592
- I'm kidding you.
- All right, listen.

23:30.593 --> 23:32.469
I think they forgot about
us. You want a refill?

23:32.470 --> 23:34.371
Sure.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.479
Yeah, I know you. You're the husband.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.015
I've seen you in a
magazine. The Arm Candy list.

23:46.618 --> 23:48.919
You're married to the lady
secretary of state, right?

23:48.920 --> 23:50.888
Yeah.

23:50.889 --> 23:54.325
Hey, he's Mr. Secretary of State.

23:54.326 --> 23:55.593
That's nice, thanks.

23:55.594 --> 23:58.495
Your wife and this president...

23:58.496 --> 24:01.265
they want to make peace with the Iranians.

24:01.266 --> 24:04.368
Why don't we just pack up
our balls and send them over?

24:04.369 --> 24:06.702
I'm here with my kid, okay?

24:08.205 --> 24:10.341
You know how many of my friends died

24:10.342 --> 24:12.710
trying to get out from
under these bastards?

24:12.711 --> 24:15.546
And now your wife wants to make peace?

24:15.547 --> 24:17.514
I'll tell you what I think about that.

24:17.515 --> 24:18.749
She's a piece.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.550
She's a real piece of work.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.188
Get off me, man!

24:24.189 --> 24:25.689
You're drunk, and you're in uniform.

24:25.690 --> 24:26.824
You know what that means?

24:26.825 --> 24:28.774
Big Chicken Dinner...
Bad Conduct Discharge.

24:28.775 --> 24:30.761
- You MP?
- No.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.330
Fortunately for you,
Captain, USMC. Retired.

24:33.331 --> 24:36.266
Just don't disgrace yourself
in public, okay, Lieutenant?

24:36.267 --> 24:37.701
You need a cup of coffee,

24:37.702 --> 24:39.336
I'll buy you one, I'll put you in a cab.

24:39.337 --> 24:41.071
He's with us, sir. I'll take care of him.

24:41.072 --> 24:43.239
- Get him out of here.
- Thank you, Captain.

24:50.381 --> 24:52.915
I'm sorry you had to see that.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.135
At that point, I made
it very clear to Javani.

25:06.136 --> 25:09.605
Turn off the reactor,
let in the inspectors.

25:09.606 --> 25:10.473
And?

25:10.474 --> 25:12.675
And if he could agreed
to it, if he could get

25:12.676 --> 25:16.344
the Supreme Leader to agree
to it, then we'd let U.S.

25:16.446 --> 25:19.482
aerospace firms resume selling
them planes and equipment.

25:19.483 --> 25:20.816
What was Javani's exact response?

25:20.817 --> 25:23.152
Well, sir, his response was no response.

25:23.153 --> 25:26.589
What they always say
when they can't say yes.

25:26.590 --> 25:29.525
That he would take it under consideration.

25:29.526 --> 25:31.460
The next thing I hear, the talks are off,

25:31.461 --> 25:33.962
and the entire delegation
has left the building.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.165
I'm sorry, sir,

25:36.166 --> 25:37.667
but, uh,

25:37.668 --> 25:40.336
I guess it just proves what
we've suspected all along.

25:40.337 --> 25:41.903
They were never serious.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.043
I want a complete COA.

25:47.044 --> 25:49.712
Not just how we take out that reactor,

25:49.713 --> 25:54.016
but every centrifuge
and stockpile, every lab

25:54.017 --> 25:55.751
and enrichment device.

25:55.752 --> 25:57.186
I want you to tell me

25:57.187 --> 25:59.221
we can take out any hope
of their getting a bomb,

25:59.222 --> 26:02.325
not for months or years,
but for an entire generation.

26:02.326 --> 26:04.593
Give me a briefing by 1200 hours.

26:04.594 --> 26:06.028
Yes, sir.

26:06.029 --> 26:07.496
No more deadlines?

26:07.497 --> 26:09.632
No ultimatums?

26:09.633 --> 26:11.567
They say they're done with
talking, then so are we.

26:11.568 --> 26:13.134
Let's give action a chance.

26:13.736 --> 26:15.570
Bess?

26:19.509 --> 26:24.747
This morning, I woke up
thinking, I get to be it.

26:24.748 --> 26:26.549
The one who lands it.

26:26.550 --> 26:29.118
Peace in the Middle East.

26:29.119 --> 26:32.455
And tonight, I'm the guy who's going

26:32.456 --> 26:35.323
to order air strikes against Iran.

26:38.694 --> 26:42.331
That's why I want to talk to
you about that pipeline report.

26:42.332 --> 26:46.802
Sir... isn't that a fairly
low priority right now?

26:46.803 --> 26:48.170
It all connects.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.206
I want energy independence
for this country.

26:50.207 --> 26:53.342
I want us free of the influence
of people who want to kill us.

26:53.343 --> 26:54.410
Yeah.

26:54.411 --> 26:56.445
Ten presidents before me... ten...

26:56.446 --> 26:59.248
have all got bogged down over there.

26:59.249 --> 27:00.950
Iran, Iraq, the Middle East.

27:00.951 --> 27:02.952
But if I can get that freedom

27:02.953 --> 27:05.087
for at least the next generation,

27:05.088 --> 27:08.624
that's a legacy I can live with.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.126
That report is a fake.

27:10.127 --> 27:12.628
- It's a little one-sided.
- Sir,

27:12.629 --> 27:14.263
it's false.

27:14.264 --> 27:15.998
Let me ask you something.

27:15.999 --> 27:18.033
Of those ten that came before you,

27:18.034 --> 27:19.568
how many got us into trouble

27:19.569 --> 27:21.437
giving us something other than the facts,

27:21.438 --> 27:23.239
including leading us into war?

27:23.240 --> 27:25.241
What do you want?

27:25.242 --> 27:27.476
Six months. That's how long it'll take

27:27.477 --> 27:29.612
to get you a new one, a real one,

27:29.613 --> 27:30.946
and then you can decide.

27:30.947 --> 27:32.882
Don't worry about Canada.

27:32.883 --> 27:35.084
I think I have a way to
get them to live with it.

27:35.085 --> 27:36.452
It's a big ask.

27:36.453 --> 27:39.755
Nothing compared to my next one.

27:39.756 --> 27:42.358
I need you to give me a day
before you send those bombers

27:42.359 --> 27:44.393
into Iran.

27:44.394 --> 27:47.629
A day? For what?

27:48.264 --> 27:50.798
For me to do my job.

27:53.969 --> 27:57.544
She asked me to get her
the Canadian ambassador.

27:57.545 --> 27:58.889
- No one else?
- No.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.515
Well, that doesn't
sound like war with Iran.

28:00.516 --> 28:01.663
Unless she's canceling the party

28:01.664 --> 28:03.618
- because of war with Iran.
- She told me to wake him up

28:03.619 --> 28:05.481
if I have to. That's not
about canceling the party.

28:05.482 --> 28:08.951
I have Secretary McCord
for the ambassador. Yes.

28:08.952 --> 28:10.852
Hey, can you come here?

28:16.626 --> 28:18.627
Look, there may not even be a tomorrow,

28:18.628 --> 28:21.030
but, uh, for what it's worth...

28:21.031 --> 28:22.465
Yes?

28:22.466 --> 28:26.836
I did not break up with
Carly because of you.

28:26.837 --> 28:29.872
We were coming up on
our one-year anniversary,

28:29.873 --> 28:34.342
and... I didn't want to
give her the wrong idea.

28:35.678 --> 28:37.680
What idea was that?

28:37.681 --> 28:40.615
That she was the one.

28:41.617 --> 28:45.054
I mean, she was almost
the one, but not quite.

28:45.055 --> 28:47.890
And I'm not saying that

28:47.891 --> 28:50.693
anybody else I know is
the one. I'm just saying,

28:50.694 --> 28:52.695
she wasn't.

28:52.696 --> 28:54.730
Got it.

28:54.731 --> 28:57.566
Uh, okay.

28:57.567 --> 28:59.635
Do you think Win is the one?

28:59.636 --> 29:01.337
Yes.

29:01.338 --> 29:04.006
Oh. Cool. Good for...

29:04.007 --> 29:06.374
for you.

29:09.278 --> 29:11.347
Oh, my...

29:28.464 --> 29:30.866
Oh, very nice.

29:30.867 --> 29:33.168
She wears brink-of-disaster very well.

29:33.169 --> 29:36.071
I am having unclean thoughts
about my boss's husband.

29:36.072 --> 29:38.007
Okay, you're talking out loud.

29:38.008 --> 29:39.475
- Where's Winthrop?
- Win.

29:39.476 --> 29:41.076
- Thank you.
- And he had to work.

29:41.077 --> 29:42.411
Oh, what does he do again?

29:42.412 --> 29:44.380
He's a lobbyist for an alternative

29:44.381 --> 29:45.714
health care pharmaceutical company.

29:45.715 --> 29:47.630
- Oh, the medical marijuana thing.
- That is just one aspect.

29:47.631 --> 29:49.652
God. Everybody goes there.

29:49.653 --> 29:51.654
Uh, where's your date?

29:51.655 --> 29:53.856
Uh, new relationship.

29:53.857 --> 29:56.091
I thought this shindig
was a little, you know,

29:56.092 --> 29:58.360
big to bring in a start-up.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.862
Also in government work?

29:59.863 --> 30:01.130
SEC lawyer.

30:01.131 --> 30:03.065
SEC lawyer by the name of...?

30:03.066 --> 30:04.567
Chris.

30:08.305 --> 30:10.306
French Canadian.

30:10.307 --> 30:13.708
I'm only getting every
third word, but who cares?

30:15.010 --> 30:17.411
I'm guessing that isn't Carly.

30:25.187 --> 30:27.923
...take it from a block of ice.

30:27.924 --> 30:31.427
Especially in Winnipeg, they have large...

30:31.428 --> 30:32.828
Hi. We were just talking

30:32.829 --> 30:33.762
about ice.

30:33.763 --> 30:35.864
Ice is a wonderful substance.

30:35.865 --> 30:39.868
You might say we Canadians
know a lot about it.

30:39.869 --> 30:42.304
And we also know the
wonderful things that happen

30:42.305 --> 30:43.505
when it melts.

30:43.506 --> 30:45.674
Your Northwest Passage.

30:45.675 --> 30:47.443
Our Northwest Passage. Thank you, again.

30:47.444 --> 30:49.178
The trade route?

30:49.179 --> 30:50.479
Atlantic to Pacific.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.747
The water route to China

30:51.748 --> 30:54.116
that so many died looking for.

30:54.117 --> 30:55.384
For a long time, it didn't exist.

30:55.385 --> 30:56.719
Now it exists all the time, right?

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
Because of global warming

30:57.721 --> 30:59.188
and the melting of the Canadian ice pack.

30:59.189 --> 31:01.156
Which both countries agree is a bad thing.

31:01.157 --> 31:03.859
And which, with patience,
we will both do our best

31:03.860 --> 31:05.294
to keep from getting worse.

31:05.295 --> 31:07.463
In return, Madam Secretary,

31:07.464 --> 31:09.431
unlike her predecessor,

31:09.432 --> 31:12.901
has agreed to recognize Canadian
claims to the northern waters.

31:12.902 --> 31:17.139
Again, merci, Madame la Secrétaire.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.341
Thus ending disputes
over the shipping rights

31:19.342 --> 31:20.743
that have lasted for centuries.

31:20.744 --> 31:22.044
Since the War of 1812,

31:22.045 --> 31:23.445
if I'm not mistaken.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.414
Which many think was a U.S. victory,

31:25.415 --> 31:28.550
but historians agree was
more like a... a draw.

31:28.551 --> 31:31.620
Hand to God, I did not prep him.

31:31.621 --> 31:32.621
I didn't.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.526
Shall we?

31:42.665 --> 31:44.667
I'm supposed to ask you to dance.

31:44.668 --> 31:48.070
Yes. To create a distraction.

31:48.071 --> 31:50.572
What makes you think I wasn't
going to ask you anyway?

31:50.573 --> 31:53.708
You're very kind, Dr. McCord.

32:06.088 --> 32:07.556
Down here to the right.

32:07.557 --> 32:09.258
- Okay.
- Good luck.

32:09.259 --> 32:11.325
Thank you.

32:16.065 --> 32:19.868
So, where's your Canadienne Francaise?

32:19.869 --> 32:21.336
We exchanged data.

32:21.337 --> 32:22.771
We both had to work.

32:22.772 --> 32:24.206
Decided to keep it professional.

32:24.207 --> 32:27.209
Smart.

32:27.210 --> 32:28.944
It looks odd.

32:28.945 --> 32:30.612
Us not dancing.

32:30.613 --> 32:33.415
We probably should.

32:33.416 --> 32:34.983
Yeah, to be professional.

32:34.984 --> 32:36.918
Exactly.

32:53.669 --> 32:56.572
Ambassador Javani.

32:56.573 --> 32:59.907
I've been looking forward to
meeting you, Madam Secretary.

33:09.546 --> 33:12.323
It's very generous of your
host to offer us this piece

33:12.324 --> 33:13.825
of Canadian soil on which to meet.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.223
Since I am not allowed
to step foot on yours

33:16.224 --> 33:17.757
outside of the, uh,

33:17.758 --> 33:20.026
- UN grounds in Manhattan.
- Well,

33:20.027 --> 33:22.796
I'm hoping that our diplomatic
status will change soon.

33:22.797 --> 33:23.763
It will.

33:23.764 --> 33:26.331
If you take military action.

33:26.966 --> 33:30.537
We don't want war, Mr. Javani.

33:30.538 --> 33:32.939
Then why send us your Mr. Bollings, huh?

33:32.940 --> 33:34.974
He is a bully

33:34.975 --> 33:36.976
and a saber-rattler.

33:36.977 --> 33:39.479
What did he say to you?

33:39.480 --> 33:41.014
You need to ask?

33:41.015 --> 33:44.951
He said that he brought
a message from, uh, you

33:44.952 --> 33:46.586
and the president

33:46.587 --> 33:48.755
saying that the next step would be bombings

33:48.756 --> 33:50.824
unless the reactor was shut down

33:50.825 --> 33:53.693
and inspectors allowed in
within the next 24 hours.

33:53.694 --> 33:55.328
Nothing else?

33:55.329 --> 33:57.963
No. Nothing else.

33:59.833 --> 34:02.001
Was there supposed to be?

34:03.637 --> 34:05.705
Secretary McCord,

34:05.706 --> 34:07.540
is it possible that, um,

34:07.541 --> 34:12.344
you and your chief negotiator
are not in perfect agreement?

34:12.346 --> 34:14.414
I was hoping as much

34:14.415 --> 34:17.016
when I accepted your invitation here.

34:17.016 --> 34:18.299
Via Ambassador Clark.

34:18.300 --> 34:20.136
Ambassador, I'm sorry, but
you're gonna have to give me

34:20.137 --> 34:22.545
a reason to believe
everything you just told me.

34:22.545 --> 34:24.657
And why would I be lying?

34:24.658 --> 34:27.226
When I have taken such
a risk in coming here.

34:27.228 --> 34:29.763
If certain factions found out, I-I...

34:29.764 --> 34:31.496
I would be destroyed.

34:35.668 --> 34:38.371
I have, um...

34:38.371 --> 34:40.672
I have two boys,

34:40.674 --> 34:44.043
nine and 11.

34:44.043 --> 34:47.013
I do not want them to inherit a war

34:47.014 --> 34:50.215
any more than you want
that for your children.

34:54.454 --> 34:57.590
I have a copy of a letter from me

34:57.591 --> 35:00.727
to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

35:00.728 --> 35:03.997
It authorizes lifting the ban

35:03.998 --> 35:08.268
on trade in civilian
airplanes and equipment

35:08.269 --> 35:12.605
by American firms with
the Republic of Iran.

35:12.606 --> 35:17.409
Take it to your Supreme Leader.

35:20.113 --> 35:22.115
You haven't signed it.

35:22.116 --> 35:24.284
I'll put my name there

35:24.285 --> 35:27.020
when that reactor goes offline

35:27.021 --> 35:29.389
and an inspector tells me it's offline.

35:29.390 --> 35:30.690
And if you

35:30.691 --> 35:32.425
and President Shiraz want help

35:32.426 --> 35:36.463
in bringing your more
militant faction into line,

35:36.464 --> 35:39.532
you can also say that you personally forced

35:39.533 --> 35:42.836
this concession from me and my president.

35:42.837 --> 35:46.406
You can tell 'em that
you got the Great Satan,

35:46.407 --> 35:49.075
the United States, to blink

35:49.076 --> 35:52.078
in a private meeting between us

35:52.079 --> 35:54.813
in New York.

35:55.448 --> 35:57.849
I don't have to show him.

35:58.952 --> 36:00.520
I'll call him.

36:00.521 --> 36:02.489
Tonight.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.523
Thank you.

36:06.059 --> 36:08.161
Tell me,

36:08.162 --> 36:11.831
is it true that while you were at the CIA,

36:11.832 --> 36:15.134
I was referred to as your boyfriend?

36:18.038 --> 36:21.207
Uh, it was more of a joke.

36:21.208 --> 36:25.177
Well, not a joke, but...
more of a code name.

36:25.812 --> 36:27.347
And what was it code for?

36:27.348 --> 36:30.350
I had my eye on you.

36:30.351 --> 36:34.420
I picked you as a sort of
metaphorical dance partner.

36:34.421 --> 36:35.588
Hmm.

36:35.589 --> 36:36.923
I thought you were

36:36.924 --> 36:40.192
someone who could help lead us to peace.

36:42.428 --> 36:44.464
Well, I hope that I can join you

36:44.465 --> 36:48.033
in that dance one day, Madam Secretary.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.472
Thank you.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.556
Hey.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.058
There he is.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.427
The prettiest one at the ball.

37:08.428 --> 37:10.062
Ah, that would still be your mother.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.830
Hey, buddy. You're up kind of late.

37:11.831 --> 37:16.067
Alison went to bed early,
but he said he wasn't sleepy.

37:17.169 --> 37:19.638
Maybe he needs to talk to someone

37:19.639 --> 37:21.640
who isn't his sister.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.375
Okay, where is Mom?

37:23.376 --> 37:24.977
She still had some stuff to do.

37:24.978 --> 37:26.445
She'll be a little while.

37:26.446 --> 37:28.412
Are we going to war?

37:29.615 --> 37:31.884
Well, your mother's gonna
do everything in her power

37:31.885 --> 37:33.252
to make sure we don't.

37:33.253 --> 37:34.586
And you know Mom

37:34.587 --> 37:36.788
when she makes up her mind about something.

37:36.789 --> 37:38.323
Yeah.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.325
You were in a war, right?

37:40.326 --> 37:41.460
Yeah. Desert Storm.

37:41.461 --> 37:43.561
That was the first time we invaded Iraq.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.465
Did you fly fighter jets?

37:46.466 --> 37:47.533
Mmm.

37:47.534 --> 37:48.901
F/A-18 Hornet.

37:48.902 --> 37:50.935
Yeah.

37:54.139 --> 37:56.107
Did you kill anyone?

38:01.313 --> 38:03.714
Yes, I did.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.385
How many?

38:09.354 --> 38:10.989
Well, it's like this.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.391
You're 20,000 feet up.

38:12.392 --> 38:14.593
You press a button, look at your screen,

38:14.594 --> 38:16.762
and you see if you hit your target.

38:16.763 --> 38:20.931
And I always hit my target.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.337
I'll tell you this.

38:25.338 --> 38:27.806
By the time you find yourself
in a situation like that,

38:27.807 --> 38:33.111
you've made up your mind
how you feel about...

38:33.112 --> 38:35.414
a lot of things.

38:35.415 --> 38:37.482
It's part of the training.

38:37.483 --> 38:41.886
You don't take an action like that lightly.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.057
Do you still think about it?

38:50.462 --> 38:52.197
I do, yeah.

38:52.198 --> 38:54.498
A lot.

38:59.271 --> 39:01.172
Good night, Dad.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.974
Good night.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.600
- I'm taking the stairs.
- I'm taking the stairs.

39:28.601 --> 39:29.968
You were supposed to take the elevator.

39:29.969 --> 39:31.470
I took the stairs because I thought

39:31.471 --> 39:32.604
you were taking the elevator,

39:32.605 --> 39:34.047
so we wouldn't get here at the same time.

39:34.048 --> 39:35.626
Oh, well, now we're getting here

39:35.627 --> 39:37.609
at the same time, both taking the stairs.

39:37.610 --> 39:39.544
And we both have coffee
from the same place.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.246
We should just make a public announcement.

39:41.247 --> 39:43.481
Sounds good to me.

39:44.116 --> 39:46.485
Also, I got you this coffee.

39:47.887 --> 39:49.788
Good morning. You're both late.

39:49.789 --> 39:50.989
We're both early.

39:50.990 --> 39:52.557
Total coincidence.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.559
She's already called a meeting.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.261
The talks with Iran are set to resume,

39:56.262 --> 39:58.230
and we need to get out the good news.

39:58.231 --> 39:59.431
What happened?

39:59.432 --> 40:02.934
The reactor at Hekmat went
offline four hours ago,

40:02.935 --> 40:05.304
weapons inspectors are in
the air, and I understand

40:05.305 --> 40:08.173
there's to be an announcement
from the Treasury Department.

40:08.174 --> 40:10.208
We're selling them
commercial airplane parts.

40:10.209 --> 40:11.343
That's great.

40:11.344 --> 40:12.978
I'm assuming you didn't get my e-mails

40:12.979 --> 40:17.147
because there's no signal in the stairwell.

40:18.050 --> 40:20.018
I have started taking the stairs.

40:20.019 --> 40:22.821
The whole 10,000 steps a
day thing... for my heart.

40:22.822 --> 40:24.489
Health.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.991
And she inspired me

40:25.992 --> 40:27.993
to care about my heart.

40:27.994 --> 40:29.895
In a health way.

40:29.896 --> 40:33.230
Mmm. How can I say this
with love and respect?

40:34.366 --> 40:37.735
No one cares.

40:45.044 --> 40:47.412
So they blinked.

40:47.413 --> 40:49.614
My tactics worked.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.550
Well... well, not exactly, Allen,

40:51.551 --> 40:52.951
but the details are irrelevant.

40:52.952 --> 40:55.554
No, I called you in here on something else.

40:55.555 --> 40:58.088
The president wants your resignation.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.465
I want to hear this from
the president himself.

41:06.466 --> 41:09.033
Oh, trust me... you don't.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.870
What is the charge?

41:11.871 --> 41:12.956
You looked the leader

41:12.957 --> 41:14.264
of the free world in the eye

41:14.265 --> 41:16.441
and lied about making an offer to Javani.

41:16.442 --> 41:18.510
Now, who told you that?

41:18.511 --> 41:20.377
Javani.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.014
You went behind my back.

41:23.015 --> 41:27.986
You never really had faith
in this process, did you?

41:27.987 --> 41:30.655
You were always hoping
for a military solution.

41:30.656 --> 41:31.957
Yes.

41:31.958 --> 41:33.258
I was.

41:33.259 --> 41:36.461
Because I sat across from
the Serbians in Kosovo,

41:36.462 --> 41:38.930
the Provos and IRA in Northern Ireland.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.433
And I know what they
understand, and it's force.

41:41.434 --> 41:43.935
You don't let them know you're
prepared to make concessions

41:43.936 --> 41:46.538
because they already know you're weak.

41:46.539 --> 41:47.906
And they know it, Madam Secretary.

41:47.907 --> 41:50.142
You and this president...
they know what you are.

41:50.143 --> 41:52.511
The Iranians, Javani...

41:52.512 --> 41:55.347
they know, if they can just
string you along long enough,

41:55.348 --> 41:57.282
delude you with enough
please-and-thank-yous,

41:57.283 --> 42:00.684
that's all they need to get what they want.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.754
Then one day,

42:02.755 --> 42:07.092
we'll all wake up to a
mushroom cloud over Tel Aviv.

42:07.093 --> 42:09.227
My God, is that what you really believe?

42:09.228 --> 42:10.629
Yes.

42:10.630 --> 42:12.597
As did your predecessor.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.933
Vincent Marsh gave me this job

42:14.934 --> 42:18.069
because he knew how to do his job.

42:18.070 --> 42:20.205
And I'll tell you another thing.

42:20.206 --> 42:22.707
If he'd lived, Vincent
Marsh would have been

42:22.708 --> 42:24.910
the next president of the United States

42:24.911 --> 42:27.245
and I'd be sitting in that chair.

42:27.246 --> 42:30.014
I'd have your job.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.486
But it's my job now.

42:34.487 --> 42:36.987
And you're fired.

42:50.402 --> 42:52.204
Do you need anything, ma'am?

42:52.205 --> 42:54.206
Yeah. Would you send Blake in?

42:54.207 --> 42:55.540
Of course.

42:55.541 --> 42:58.308
Thanks, Nadine.

43:02.147 --> 43:04.548
Ma'am.

43:06.952 --> 43:09.420
How much can I trust you, Blake?

43:10.088 --> 43:12.057
With your life, Madam Secretary.

43:12.058 --> 43:13.692
And your career, obviously.

43:13.693 --> 43:16.026
The latter will be sufficient.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.398
I need you to help me run
an investigation on someone,

43:20.399 --> 43:22.933
and I need it to be confidential.

43:23.568 --> 43:24.936
Yeah, no problem.

43:24.937 --> 43:26.571
Uh, someone in the State Department?

43:26.572 --> 43:28.038
Yeah.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.241
Nadine.
