WEBVTT

00:09.390 --> 00:10.975
So what'd you think?

00:10.977 --> 00:11.976
It was good.

00:11.978 --> 00:13.110
That's it?

00:13.112 --> 00:14.979
"Good"?

00:14.981 --> 00:17.248
I enjoyed it.
When you told me

00:17.250 --> 00:19.166
I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"

00:19.168 --> 00:22.002
I didn't think you meant showing
me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

00:22.004 --> 00:23.454
for the first time.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.457
My apologies.
I chose my words poorly.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.259
I should have said
you were about

00:28.261 --> 00:30.577
to have your world
rocked on my couch.

00:33.415 --> 00:35.266
Anyway, thank you
for watching it.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.251
It's one of my
all-time favorites.

00:37.253 --> 00:39.436
It was very entertaining...

00:39.438 --> 00:41.889
despite the glaring
story problem.

00:43.108 --> 00:45.142
Story problem?!

00:45.144 --> 00:47.511
You-- oh, Amy...

00:48.930 --> 00:51.365
What a dewy-eyed
moon-calf you are.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.534
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

00:53.536 --> 00:56.954
is the love child of Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas,

00:56.956 --> 00:59.657
two of the most gifted
filmmakers of our generation.

00:59.659 --> 01:02.142
I've watched it 36 times,

01:02.144 --> 01:04.878
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

01:04.879 --> 01:08.899
which I can only watch when
it's still light out, but...

01:08.901 --> 01:12.219
I defy you to find
a story problem.

01:12.221 --> 01:14.621
Here's my jaw... drop it.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.457
All right.

01:17.459 --> 01:19.593
Indiana Jones
plays no role

01:19.595 --> 01:21.095
in the outcome
of the story.

01:21.097 --> 01:23.063
If he weren't
in the film,

01:23.065 --> 01:25.349
it would turn out
exactly the same.

01:25.351 --> 01:28.852
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

01:28.854 --> 01:32.823
Indiana Jones was the one
in the hat with the whip.

01:32.825 --> 01:36.910
No, I do, and if he
weren't in the movie,

01:36.912 --> 01:38.812
the Nazis would have
still found the ark,

01:38.814 --> 01:41.865
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died...

01:41.867 --> 01:44.451
just like they did.

01:49.307 --> 01:50.924

02:22.930 --> 02:23.729
Hey!

02:23.731 --> 02:25.181
Hi! I thought you went

02:25.183 --> 02:27.099
to the comic book store
on Wednesdays.

02:27.101 --> 02:29.151
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

02:29.153 --> 02:31.487
and they don't need me
there to make it awkward.

02:33.323 --> 02:35.758
They have each other
for that.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.110
So, how was school?

02:38.112 --> 02:39.445
Oh, good.
Check it out.

02:39.447 --> 02:42.515
The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.675 --> 02:53.125
You bought my mom's book?

02:53.127 --> 02:54.276
Yeah!

02:54.278 --> 02:56.512
It's on the recommended
reading list

02:56.514 --> 02:57.797
for my psychology class.

03:01.952 --> 03:04.637
Come on.
Not that book.

03:04.639 --> 03:06.973
It-It's got, like,
every horrible story

03:06.975 --> 03:10.026
from my childhood in it.

03:10.028 --> 03:12.244
Oh, cool.
Are there pictures?

03:13.080 --> 03:15.731
Seriously, please find
another book.

03:15.733 --> 03:18.734
Oh, come on. Why?
How bad could it be?

03:18.736 --> 03:20.870
There-There's chapters
about potty training,

03:20.872 --> 03:23.072
and bed-wetting and...

03:23.074 --> 03:25.541
masturbation.

03:27.361 --> 03:28.828
Basically, if something
came out of me,

03:28.830 --> 03:30.413
she wrote about it!

03:31.965 --> 03:33.833
You know what?
Do whatever you want,

03:33.835 --> 03:36.218
just don't talk
to me about it.

03:36.220 --> 03:40.206
Not even the chapter on
the breast-feeding crisis?

03:44.044 --> 03:47.229
It was not a crisis.

03:47.231 --> 03:49.098
Apparently, I favored
the left one,

03:49.100 --> 03:50.933
she got a little
lopsided.

03:52.235 --> 03:55.387
Oh, my God, you still go left!

03:59.676 --> 04:03.162
Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

04:03.164 --> 04:05.414
Halle Berry.

04:06.566 --> 04:07.833
Why?

04:07.835 --> 04:09.802
Stuart and I are putting
dating profiles online,

04:09.804 --> 04:11.270
and it's one of the questions.

04:12.506 --> 04:15.240
And thank you-- I'd kill
for that woman's bone structure.

04:16.526 --> 04:19.462
Why are you reading
Pride and Prejudice?

04:19.464 --> 04:20.745
I'll tell you why.

04:20.748 --> 04:23.833
Amy ruined <i>Raiders</i>
<i>of the Lost Ark</i> for me,

04:23.835 --> 04:25.434
so now I'm trying to find

04:25.436 --> 04:27.853
something beloved to her
and ruin that.

04:28.955 --> 04:32.108
Because her life wasn't enough?

04:34.145 --> 04:37.480
Wait... how can, how can
anyone ruin <i>Raiders?</i>

04:37.482 --> 04:38.531
It's perfect.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.782
Yeah, except for the fact

04:39.784 --> 04:42.451
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

04:42.453 --> 04:46.739
With or without him, the Nazis
find the ark, open it and die.

04:51.111 --> 04:54.463
Aw! Aw!
Aw!

04:55.432 --> 04:56.499
Hey, wait a minute.

04:56.501 --> 04:58.634
No, the Nazis were digging
in the wrong place.

04:58.636 --> 05:00.302
The only reason
they got the ark

05:00.304 --> 05:01.837
was because Indy
found it first.

05:01.839 --> 05:03.789
Actually, they were
only digging in the wrong place

05:03.791 --> 05:05.057
because Indy had
the medallion.

05:05.059 --> 05:06.625
Without him, they would have
had the medallion

05:06.627 --> 05:08.460
and dug in the right place.

05:10.330 --> 05:12.648
Aw! Aw!
Aw!

05:16.403 --> 05:17.803
Okay, I know you don't

05:17.805 --> 05:19.188
want to talk about it,

05:19.190 --> 05:21.724
but can I just ask you one
question about your mom's book?

05:21.726 --> 05:22.658
No.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.093
I just want to know

05:24.095 --> 05:26.428
why a five-year-old boy
puts on his mom's makeup

05:26.430 --> 05:29.115
and wears balloon boobies.

05:31.618 --> 05:34.286
They weren't boobies,
they were muscles.

05:34.288 --> 05:35.538
And the makeup was green.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.840
I was pretending
to be The Hulk.

05:37.842 --> 05:40.259
You were wearing
her bra.

05:40.261 --> 05:41.961
That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

05:41.963 --> 05:44.597
Can we please stop talking
about this?!

05:44.599 --> 05:46.715
Okay, okay.

05:46.717 --> 05:48.050
But you know,
as a student of psychology

05:48.052 --> 05:52.221
who got a check-plus on
her first homework assignment...

05:52.223 --> 05:54.857
I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

05:54.859 --> 05:56.025
Okay, fine.

05:56.027 --> 05:58.110
Do you want to know why
I dressed like The Hulk?

05:58.112 --> 05:59.812
Because I was always mad
at my mom

05:59.814 --> 06:02.214
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

06:02.216 --> 06:04.216
Well, why were you so angry?

06:04.218 --> 06:06.702
Gee, I don't know.
Maybe it's because

06:06.704 --> 06:08.787
I was always the subject
of her little experiments.

06:08.789 --> 06:11.657
Did you get to the chapter where
she staged the Easter egg hunt

06:11.659 --> 06:14.326
with no eggs to see
how long I'd keep looking?

06:16.129 --> 06:18.664
The answer, by the way: June.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.384
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
I wish there was something

06:22.386 --> 06:24.253
I could do to make you
feel better.

06:24.255 --> 06:26.055
I do, too, but there's not.

06:26.057 --> 06:28.641
Really?
Are you sure about that?

06:31.544 --> 06:34.513
Of course, who am I to argue
with a check-plus student?

06:35.465 --> 06:36.515
Mmm...

06:36.517 --> 06:37.983
Just warning you--
I'm gonna go right.

06:37.985 --> 06:39.885
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

06:48.445 --> 06:50.963
Is makeup really necessary?

06:50.965 --> 06:53.365
Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

06:53.367 --> 06:54.934
the first thing they see
is your picture.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.835
I just want to make
sure you look fun

06:56.837 --> 06:58.704
and full of life
and not like a body

06:58.706 --> 07:00.372
they just pulled out
of the river.

07:01.858 --> 07:05.244
All right,
here we go, and...

07:05.246 --> 07:06.428
smile.

07:11.251 --> 07:13.869
Okay, uh-uh,
that one's in the bank.

07:13.871 --> 07:15.854
How about this?

07:15.856 --> 07:18.390
Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

07:18.392 --> 07:19.892
But when you do,

07:19.894 --> 07:22.878
imagine the camera is the girl
you want to meet.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.863
You got it.

07:33.873 --> 07:35.090
Okay, uh,

07:35.092 --> 07:37.660
let's try it again.

07:37.662 --> 07:40.579
Uh, but this time, pretend
the girl you want to meet

07:40.581 --> 07:42.381
doesn't want to hurt you.

07:42.383 --> 07:45.935
I don't think
I can give you that.

07:45.937 --> 07:47.720
Come on. One more time.

07:57.097 --> 07:59.982
Yeah, it's,
it's a little blurry,

07:59.984 --> 08:02.418
but I think that works
in your favor.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.736
Do you want a beer?

08:03.738 --> 08:05.254
Sure.

08:05.256 --> 08:07.406
Hey, have you finished writing
your profile yet?

08:07.408 --> 08:08.907
Almost.

08:08.909 --> 08:10.025
Oh, what did you put

08:10.027 --> 08:12.027
as the one-word description
of yourself?

08:12.029 --> 08:14.646
I put: unobjectionable.

08:15.632 --> 08:17.199
But now that I hear it out loud,

08:17.201 --> 08:19.468
it just seems like
I'm being cocky.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.520
What did you put
for your best feature?

08:21.522 --> 08:23.172
My parents' money.

08:24.758 --> 08:27.126
Uh, what did you put
for your best feature?

08:27.128 --> 08:30.045
I put: not applicable.

08:30.047 --> 08:32.496
Come on, dude, you're being
too hard on yourself.

08:32.499 --> 08:34.499
You've got a lot
of good stuff going on.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.900
Really? Like what?

08:35.903 --> 08:38.537
Well, okay, you're a,
you're a talented artist,

08:38.539 --> 08:40.472
you own your own business.

08:40.474 --> 08:43.409
Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

08:43.410 --> 08:47.129
Okay, well, can we imply

08:47.131 --> 08:49.448
that you're well-endowed?

08:49.450 --> 08:53.902
I do have one
oddly long testicle.

08:54.921 --> 08:58.190
Okay, now you're talking
like a winner!

09:01.828 --> 09:04.179
Whatcha doin'?

09:04.181 --> 09:06.865
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>

09:06.867 --> 09:09.335
is a flawless masterpiece.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.670
He's got too much pride,

09:11.672 --> 09:14.640
she's got too much prejudice--
it just works.

09:14.642 --> 09:16.541
So you're looking
to ruin something for her

09:16.543 --> 09:17.760
in the funny pages?

09:17.762 --> 09:21.680
Amy has a fondness for
the comic strip <i>Marmaduke.</i>

09:21.682 --> 09:24.316
Mm-hmm. And...?

09:24.318 --> 09:26.902
And I think I've got it.
Consider:

09:26.904 --> 09:30.022
a family possesses a dog
that is so large

09:30.024 --> 09:33.725
and poorly disciplined,
he causes nothing but problems.

09:33.727 --> 09:36.445
Why do they keep him?!

09:36.447 --> 09:39.248
Maybe they fell in love with him
as a puppy

09:39.250 --> 09:41.333
and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

09:41.335 --> 09:43.986
Of course.

09:43.988 --> 09:46.171
You know, why couldn't she
just like <i>Ziggy?</i>

09:46.173 --> 09:47.239
Yeah?

09:47.241 --> 09:49.358
That thing's riddled
with plot holes.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.795
Sorry, buddy.
Ooh!

09:52.797 --> 09:55.881
I think she's a fan
of <i>Garfield</i> as well.

09:56.851 --> 09:59.768
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.086
I'll see you later.

10:01.088 --> 10:02.988
I gotta go watch a stupid
football game with Penny.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.690
Wait-- hang on.

10:04.692 --> 10:05.974
You've spent time with Amy.

10:05.976 --> 10:08.694
Can you think of anything
she's fond of

10:08.696 --> 10:12.731
that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

10:16.569 --> 10:18.770
I gotta go.

10:23.042 --> 10:24.393
You ready to go?

10:24.395 --> 10:26.578
Yep. Hey, and maybe this time

10:26.580 --> 10:29.465
you don't try and talk sports
with the guys.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.216
Some sports bar.

10:31.218 --> 10:33.385
It's like they never
even heard of Quidditch.

10:34.270 --> 10:35.554
Do we really have to go?

10:35.556 --> 10:36.955
Oh, come on.
Every time we're about

10:36.957 --> 10:38.574
to hang out with my friends,
you don't want to.

10:38.576 --> 10:39.741
It's like, "It's too loud,"

10:39.743 --> 10:41.626
or "the bathroom's too dirty,"

10:41.628 --> 10:44.229
or "they put a chicken wing
in my ear..." I mean...

10:44.231 --> 10:46.131
Well, you're-you're right.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.132
Let's just go.

10:47.134 --> 10:48.750
Hey, what's going on with you?

10:48.752 --> 10:49.634
Nothing, I'm fine.

10:49.636 --> 10:51.186
All right, hang on.

10:51.188 --> 10:52.721
is this still about
your mom's book?

10:52.723 --> 10:55.407
No. Not everything is
about my mom.

10:55.409 --> 10:56.808
'Cause if you're still
upset about that,

10:56.810 --> 10:57.876
we don't have to go.

10:57.878 --> 10:59.828
Except this is
totally about my mom.

11:01.814 --> 11:03.031
I'm so sorry.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.316
I never should have
read that book.

11:04.318 --> 11:05.751
You know what?
You want to just get dinner

11:05.753 --> 11:06.668
and watch the game here?

11:06.670 --> 11:09.838
That sounds nice. Yeah.
Okay.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.790
Or, you know,
we could get take-out

11:11.792 --> 11:12.991
and watch the Blu-ray
extended version

11:12.993 --> 11:15.761
of <i>The Hobbit</i> movie
with commentary track.

11:18.831 --> 11:21.750
On account of how sad
I am about my mom.

11:31.034 --> 11:32.468
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

11:32.470 --> 11:34.637
One sec!

11:35.856 --> 11:36.589
Hey. Sorry.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.510
Hi, Penny.

11:40.512 --> 11:41.511
Hi.

11:41.513 --> 11:42.612
All right, sweetie.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.980
You hang in there today.

11:43.982 --> 11:45.815
I'll try, but I might
be sad again tonight.

11:45.817 --> 11:47.400
Okay.

11:49.686 --> 11:51.104
Wow!

11:51.106 --> 11:53.322
Sex at work?!

11:53.324 --> 11:54.357
Leave it alone.

11:54.359 --> 11:55.391
That's my girlfriend.

11:55.393 --> 11:56.392
Sorry.

11:56.394 --> 11:58.678
Who just had sex
with me at work!

11:59.614 --> 12:01.464
Damn. How'd you
swing that?

12:01.466 --> 12:03.783
Well, whenever I
talk about how
awful my mom was,

12:03.785 --> 12:05.901
Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

12:05.903 --> 12:07.303
Seriously?
Look, I mean...

12:07.305 --> 12:10.473
I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

12:10.475 --> 12:11.507
I-I got her to watch

12:11.509 --> 12:14.761
a six-part documentary
on <i>Monty Python.</i>

12:15.745 --> 12:17.463
Even I was bored,
I just wanted to see

12:17.465 --> 12:18.914
if she'd make it
to the end.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.184
You sound kind of
proud of it.

12:21.186 --> 12:22.085
I am; I'm really proud.

12:22.087 --> 12:23.770
Yeah.

12:24.988 --> 12:26.572
Hello, Sheldon.

12:26.574 --> 12:27.573
Is everything okay?

12:27.575 --> 12:28.574
Yes.

12:28.576 --> 12:29.709
Why?

12:29.711 --> 12:30.927
Well, the last time you made

12:30.929 --> 12:32.061
an unscheduled video-chat,

12:32.063 --> 12:34.130
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

12:34.132 --> 12:37.867
and you thought someone might be
trying to slip you a mickey.

12:38.936 --> 12:40.970
April 13...

12:40.972 --> 12:43.940
a dark night, indeed.

12:43.942 --> 12:45.641
So what can I do for you?

12:45.643 --> 12:47.743
I'm calling to invite you

12:47.745 --> 12:50.596
to a spontaneous date night
tomorrow evening.

12:50.598 --> 12:51.481
Really?

12:51.483 --> 12:52.781
Yes.

12:52.783 --> 12:54.050
You were kind enough

12:54.052 --> 12:55.968
to watch <i>Raiders of</i>
<i>the Lost Ark</i> with me.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.421
So I'd like to return the favor

12:58.423 --> 13:00.289
by inviting you
to watch an episode

13:00.291 --> 13:03.142
of your favorite childhood
television series,

13:03.144 --> 13:05.394
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

13:07.130 --> 13:09.465
That sounds lovely.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.651
Why are you
rubbing your hands together?

13:14.221 --> 13:16.105
Um...

13:16.107 --> 13:17.240
I'm putting on lotion.

13:17.242 --> 13:18.741
Are you in or not?

13:18.743 --> 13:20.409
Of course I'm in.

13:20.411 --> 13:21.661
Excellent.

13:21.663 --> 13:23.579
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

13:23.581 --> 13:24.797
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

13:24.799 --> 13:26.349
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

13:26.351 --> 13:29.252
Good night, indeed.

13:30.621 --> 13:31.921
What a rube.

13:31.923 --> 13:34.874
Why would I put on lotion
when I have such soft hands?

13:37.160 --> 13:38.994
You were really
quiet during dinner.

13:38.996 --> 13:39.962
Is everything okay?

13:39.964 --> 13:41.013
Yeah.

13:41.015 --> 13:42.882
I guess I was just
thinking about my mom,

13:42.884 --> 13:45.167
and how sad
my childhood was.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.355
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

13:49.357 --> 13:50.723
I'm gonna take a bath;
you do the dishes.

13:50.725 --> 13:53.609
How about I take
a bath with you

13:53.611 --> 13:55.361
and see what happens.

13:56.363 --> 13:57.563
Here's what's gonna happen:

13:57.565 --> 13:58.614
I'm gonna take a bath,

13:58.616 --> 13:59.949
and you're gonna do the dishes.

13:59.951 --> 14:01.117
That's it?

14:01.119 --> 14:02.902
No compassion?

14:02.904 --> 14:04.120
Aw, poor Howie.

14:04.122 --> 14:05.271
We good?
I'm gonna take a bath.

14:05.273 --> 14:07.323
Bernie...

14:07.325 --> 14:09.492
God, what is going on with you?

14:09.494 --> 14:11.644
I'm sharing my pain.

14:12.629 --> 14:15.882
And I'm not buying it.
Try again.

14:17.234 --> 14:20.136
I'm learning to be
a man in a culture

14:20.138 --> 14:22.871
where it's increasingly
difficult to know how...?

14:22.873 --> 14:25.825
Strike two.

14:25.827 --> 14:27.894
I'm copying Leonard.

14:27.896 --> 14:29.044
When he does this to Penny,

14:29.046 --> 14:31.147
they have sex and
watch <i>Monty Python.</i>

14:31.149 --> 14:32.448
Howard!
I know.

14:32.450 --> 14:33.349
It was dumb,

14:33.351 --> 14:34.383
I shouldn't
have done it.

14:34.385 --> 14:36.903
And it's making
me feel sad...

14:36.905 --> 14:39.322
So sad.

14:41.057 --> 14:43.242
You know, why don't
you take a bath? I'll do the dishes.

14:47.264 --> 14:50.733
Three, two,
one...

14:50.735 --> 14:51.918
That's it.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.687
Our dating profiles are
live on the Internet.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.572
Attention all shoppers:

14:56.574 --> 15:00.259
my business is open
for business!

15:00.261 --> 15:02.929
That's right, ladies.

15:02.931 --> 15:04.580
For all you know,

15:04.582 --> 15:06.866
I'm confident
and fun to be around.

15:10.021 --> 15:11.687
Oh, cool, it tells you

15:11.689 --> 15:13.339
when someone's reading
your profile.

15:13.341 --> 15:15.608
"Jenny309."

15:16.893 --> 15:19.195
I hope that's not her weight.

15:19.197 --> 15:21.614
If it is, I'll...
I'll take her.

15:22.783 --> 15:24.850
Good one.

15:26.204 --> 15:28.654
Ooh, I got one, too.

15:28.656 --> 15:30.923
The ladies are
coming to us.

15:32.459 --> 15:34.710
Oh, man, if I'd started
this years ago,

15:34.712 --> 15:37.279
I'd be divorced two
or three times by now.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.783
What...? Another one.

15:40.785 --> 15:42.785
You know,
it... it's weird.

15:42.787 --> 15:44.303
When they're reading
your profile, does it...

15:44.305 --> 15:45.972
does it make you
feel exposed?

15:45.974 --> 15:48.140
Like they see you naked?

15:49.326 --> 15:52.461
Well, they're not running
away screaming, so, no.

15:54.948 --> 15:56.565
I love <i>Little House.</i>

15:56.567 --> 15:58.951
It made me want to
live on a farm so much

15:58.953 --> 16:00.686
I tried to milk my cat.

16:04.140 --> 16:05.458
That tangy bowl of Cheerios

16:05.460 --> 16:06.909
was not worth the stitches.

16:08.945 --> 16:11.197
Well, you sit back, relax

16:11.199 --> 16:14.583
and enjoy a beloved
childhood memory.

16:17.722 --> 16:21.007
You see that cabin there?

16:21.009 --> 16:24.293
I read they were illegally
squatting on Indian land.

16:24.295 --> 16:26.262
Yeah.

16:26.264 --> 16:28.547
Personally,
I think what we did

16:28.549 --> 16:30.933
to the Native
Americans was wrong,

16:30.935 --> 16:33.436
but this is your
favorite show, not mine.

16:33.438 --> 16:36.589
Oh, look at little
Laura Ingalls,

16:36.591 --> 16:39.125
eating that
peanut butter sandwich.

16:39.127 --> 16:40.676
Peanut butter?!

16:40.678 --> 16:43.396
Huh!

16:43.398 --> 16:45.681
That's strange,
since peanut butter

16:45.683 --> 16:48.684
wasn't introduced
until the early 1900s.

16:51.038 --> 16:53.205
If I knew this show
was about time travel,

16:53.207 --> 16:56.158
I would have watched it
much sooner.

16:58.745 --> 16:59.912
You're trying to get back at me

16:59.914 --> 17:02.064
for what I said about
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

17:02.066 --> 17:03.632
That's silly.

17:03.634 --> 17:06.585
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,

17:06.587 --> 17:07.970
since telephones
only existed

17:07.972 --> 17:09.704
in large cities
at that time.

17:09.707 --> 17:12.508
This is more like
<i>Little House on the Preposterous.</i>

17:14.294 --> 17:17.045
Sheldon, we're
in a relationship.

17:17.047 --> 17:19.265
When you get angry,
just tell me.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.416
You don't need to seek revenge.

17:21.419 --> 17:24.119
Are you sure?

17:25.005 --> 17:26.739
Every time my dad
stayed out all night,

17:26.741 --> 17:30.359
my mom would put hamster poop
in his chewing tobacco.

17:32.061 --> 17:33.796
Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

17:33.798 --> 17:35.998
Fine.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.283
I'm mad at you.

17:37.285 --> 17:39.835
Not only did you ruin
<i>Raiders</i> for me,

17:39.837 --> 17:41.754
you may have ruined
the whole franchise.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.789
Except for the fourth one,

17:43.791 --> 17:46.125
which was bad before
you got your mitts on it.

17:47.677 --> 17:48.961
I-I shouldn't have said it.

17:48.963 --> 17:49.979
I'm sorry.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.914
Thank you.

17:51.916 --> 17:53.282
Do you feel better?

17:53.284 --> 17:54.850
Yes.

17:54.852 --> 17:57.386
But not as good as
I'm going to when I tell you

17:57.388 --> 17:59.805
that your precious Garfield
has no reason to hate Mondays.

18:00.757 --> 18:03.258
He's a cat.
He doesn't have a job.

18:07.831 --> 18:11.484
Hey, I was just--
what is happening?

18:12.602 --> 18:14.320
Oh, just a little treat.

18:14.322 --> 18:16.071
I know you've been
feeling really bad

18:16.073 --> 18:17.523
about your mom lately.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.408
Oh, oh, I have.

18:19.410 --> 18:20.943
So bad.

18:20.945 --> 18:22.912
And I wanted
to make you feel better,

18:22.914 --> 18:25.131
so I planned something
very special for you.

18:25.133 --> 18:26.148
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

18:26.150 --> 18:29.084
I can already feel it working.

18:30.286 --> 18:32.655
Hello, Leonard.

18:34.257 --> 18:36.375
Mom?!

18:36.377 --> 18:39.912
I understand you have been
whining about my parenting

18:39.914 --> 18:42.515
in order to emotionally
manipulate your girlfriend.

18:42.517 --> 18:44.366
I... uh...

18:44.368 --> 18:45.684
Bernadette told me
everything.

18:45.686 --> 18:47.820
Now you don't get
the left or the right.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.590
Let's discuss

18:51.592 --> 18:53.642
why you continue to involve me

18:53.644 --> 18:55.044
in your sex life.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.245
Oh, please, Mommy.

18:56.247 --> 18:58.831
No, Mommy.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.065
When you were six years old,

19:00.067 --> 19:03.102
you walked in on me
and your father naked.

19:04.337 --> 19:05.738
I was swatting his bottom

19:05.740 --> 19:09.041
with your brand
new Ping Pong paddle.

19:11.478 --> 19:15.047
I didn't dream that?

19:15.049 --> 19:17.883
How did that make you feel?

19:17.885 --> 19:19.552
Penny, come back!

19:19.554 --> 19:22.188
I'm sad for real now!

19:23.390 --> 19:25.057
In the last two hours,

19:25.059 --> 19:27.676
162 women have
read our profiles.

19:27.678 --> 19:29.395
How many of them have
sent us messages?

19:29.397 --> 19:30.863
Combined?
Yes.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.065
Zero.

19:35.184 --> 19:36.986
Dude, this is...
this is brutal.

19:36.988 --> 19:40.155
I don't think I've
ever felt so rejected.

19:40.157 --> 19:41.857
And I had a rescue dog

19:41.859 --> 19:44.410
who ran back
to the pound.

19:46.997 --> 19:48.196
This is the worst.

19:48.198 --> 19:49.197
If we're gonna get shot down,

19:49.199 --> 19:50.649
we might as well just
go to a bar

19:50.651 --> 19:51.767
and do it old school.

19:51.769 --> 19:54.019
And make them
look us in the eye.

19:54.021 --> 19:55.638
Yeah, anything is
better than this.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.189
Hello.

19:57.191 --> 19:58.540
Not interested.

20:01.094 --> 20:03.345
I was wrong.
This is worse.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.617
Wait, wait-- if it wasn't
for Indiana Jones,

20:18.619 --> 20:20.702
the ark would never have
ended up at the warehouse!

20:20.704 --> 20:22.621
That's true!

20:22.623 --> 20:24.740
He collected and
delivered the ark

20:24.742 --> 20:26.792
to the proper
authorities for filing.

20:26.794 --> 20:27.526
Like a hero!

20:27.528 --> 20:29.878
Yeah!
Yes! Right!

20:31.498 --> 20:32.664
Although, technically,

20:32.666 --> 20:34.249
Indy was supposed
to take the ark

20:34.251 --> 20:35.501
to a museum to be studied.

20:35.503 --> 20:37.169
He couldn't even get that done.

20:38.910 --> 20:41.043
Aw...
