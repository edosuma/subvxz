WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:01.800
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.833 --> 00:03.667
I DIDN'T GET THE HEART.
YOU DIDN'T GET THE HEART.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.367
I CANNOT FALL FOR A PATIENT.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.333
(Miranda) WHAT'S GOIN' ON
BETWEEN STEVENS AND DENNY?

00:07.367 --> 00:09.500
IS IT A CRUSH,
IS IT AN INNOCENT FLIRTATION,

00:09.533 --> 00:12.567
OR IS STEVENS ACTUALLY
CROSSING THE LINE?
I'M CONSIDERING
THE POSSIBILITY

00:12.600 --> 00:16.033
OF MAYBE HAVING
A DATE WITH A VET.
IS HE SICK AGAIN?

00:16.067 --> 00:18.833
I GOT HOME. HE WAS LISTLESS
AND HADN'T EATEN ALL DAY.
THOSE GIRLS
WERE STARING AT ME

00:18.867 --> 00:21.100
LIKE I WAS A RODENT
OR SOMETHING.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.500
I'M A SURGEON FIRST,
JUST LIKE YOU.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.733
NO, NOT JUST LIKE ME.
I AM A PERSON FIRST.

00:25.767 --> 00:28.300
IF BURKE CAN FORGIVE ME
FOR FALLING ASLEEP DURING SEX--
BURKE HASN'T FORGIVEN YOU.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.600
YOU LEFT ME. YOU DON'T GET
TO CALL ME A WHORE.

00:30.633 --> 00:33.400
THIS THING WITH US
IS FINISHED. IT'S OVER.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.333
***

00:35.367 --> 00:37.267
(Meredith) IN LIFE,
WE ARE TAUGHT

00:37.300 --> 00:39.233
THAT THERE ARE
SEVEN DEADLY SINS.

00:39.267 --> 00:41.167
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT HERE.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.567
WE ALL KNOW THE BIG ONES--
GLUTTONY, PRIDE, LUST...

00:44.600 --> 00:45.800
HE'S PICTURING MY FACE.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.533
HE'S TOTALLY PICTURING
THAT DART

00:48.567 --> 00:50.100
PUNCTURING MY SKULL.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.367
BUT THE SIN YOU DON'T HEAR
MUCH ABOUT IS ANGER.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.567
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.100
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE THINK
ANGER'S NOT THAT DANGEROUS...

00:58.133 --> 01:00.367
***

01:00.400 --> 01:02.500
DEREK--
DEREK IS PICTURING YOU.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.467
THAT WE CAN CONTROL IT...

01:04.500 --> 01:07.700
HE CALLED ME A WHORE.
HE LOST THE RIGHT TO PICTURE ME.

01:07.733 --> 01:11.467
SO I FELL ASLEEP DURING SEX--
SO WHAT?

01:11.500 --> 01:13.600
ASS!
ASS!

01:13.633 --> 01:15.567
OH, ASS! HEY.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.567
WELL, WELL, ISOBEL STEVENS
HAS FINALLY LEFT THE HOSPITAL.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.700
DOES THIS MEAN HEART PATIENT
DUDE FINALLY KICKED IT?

01:20.733 --> 01:23.067
I'M SORRY.
THIS SECTION OF THE BAR

01:23.100 --> 01:24.467
IS FOR SURGEONS.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.800
WE DON'T SOCIALIZE
WITH GYNECOLOGISTS.

01:26.833 --> 01:28.333
(mouths words)

01:28.367 --> 01:30.067
(laughter)

01:31.200 --> 01:33.267
GEORGE!
HI.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.500
MY POINT IS,
MAYBE WE DON'T GIVE ANGER

01:35.533 --> 01:36.567
ENOUGH CREDIT.
HEY.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.467
HI, CALLIE.
HEY, DR. TORRES.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.800
MAYBE IT CAN BE A LOT MORE
DANGEROUS THAN WE THINK.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.167
AFTER ALL, WHEN IT COMES
TO DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR...

01:44.200 --> 01:46.167
GIN AND TONIC
AND A BEER.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.767
IT DID MAKE THE TOP SEVEN.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.667
***

01:52.700 --> 01:55.333
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS?

01:55.367 --> 01:57.767
YES, HE SAID BONE CANCER,
SO THAT WOULD BE HIS DIAGNOSIS.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.633
I HEARD HIM.
I WAS DOUBLE-CHECKING.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.567
I STILL NEED TO DO
A BONE SCAN

02:03.600 --> 02:05.733
TO SEE HOW FAR IT'S SPREAD.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.267
OSTEOSARCOMAS ARE AGGRESSIVE,

02:07.300 --> 02:09.100
BUT, UH, WE CAN TRY
AND TREAT IT WITH CHEMO

02:09.133 --> 02:10.300
OR REMOVE THE TUMOR
ENTIRELY.

02:10.333 --> 02:14.067
IF IT'S SPREAD TOO FAR, WE MAY
HAVE TO AMPUTATE THE LIMB.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.433
AT THAT POINT,
SHOULD WE EVEN BOTHER?

02:15.467 --> 02:17.633
(Meredith) OH, RIGHT,
LET'S JUST LET HIM DIE.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.800
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO SUFFER, MEREDITH.
RIGHT.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.567
(bell dings)

02:23.600 --> 02:26.433
SO WHAT'S--I MEAN,
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON?

02:26.467 --> 02:28.367
NO.
NO.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.267
DID YOU GUYS HAVE
A FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.400
NO.
NO.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.167
SO... WE'RE ALL STILL...
FRIENDS?

02:35.200 --> 02:36.533
YES.
YES.

02:36.567 --> 02:39.067
(bell dings)

02:44.267 --> 02:45.067
(sighs)

02:45.100 --> 02:46.733
I HEARD YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING A HEART

02:46.767 --> 02:48.800
FOR A TRANSPLANT.

02:48.833 --> 02:51.733
MERCY WEST HAS A HEART,
AND I'M GOING TO GET IT, YES.

02:51.767 --> 02:54.200
CAN I GO? 'CAUSE, UM,
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE...

02:54.233 --> 02:57.100
WITH DR. BAILEY
WHEN SHE WENT TO GET A HEART.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.067
YOU CAN ASK HER.
I WAS VERY HELPFUL.

02:59.067 --> 03:00.267
OH, I'M SURE YOU WERE,

03:00.300 --> 03:03.367
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP ON THIS ONE.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.067
(siren whoops)

03:06.067 --> 03:08.567
(man) 22-YEAR-OLD WHITE MALE.
G.S.W. TO THE LEFT SHOULDER.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.567
(woman) THREE DEAD ON SCENE,
MULTIPLE WALKING WOUNDED.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.133
FIVE MOST INJURED
ARE COMING IN BEHIND US.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.067
WE'RE GONNA NEED...
WHY ARE THEY ALL
IN THE HALLWAY?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.433
OVERFLOW FROM THE E.R.

03:15.467 --> 03:17.367
PARAMEDIC TOLD US
SOME EMPLOYEE WENT POSTAL,

03:17.400 --> 03:19.300
SHOT UP A RESTAURANT.
I HEARD HE GOT AWAY.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.367
REALLY?
NEAL HANNIGAN
AND DEBORAH FLEISS.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.833
THEY WERE PAYING AT THE REGISTER
WHEN THE GUNMAN CAME IN.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.833
SHE'S GOT A THROUGH AND THROUGH
TO THE RIGHT UPPER ARM.

03:25.867 --> 03:26.967
GOOD DISTAL PULSES.

03:27.067 --> 03:29.800
HE SUSTAINED A POSSIBLE
GRAZE WOUND TO THE RIGHT BACK.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.300
LET'S IRRIGATE THE WOUND,
GET THEM TO X-RAY

03:32.333 --> 03:33.800
AND ORDER A TET-TOX FOR BOTH.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.167
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
TAKE CARE OF MY DEBORAH FIRST.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.433
OH, NOW YOU'RE CONCERNED.
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.800
SORRY?

03:39.833 --> 03:41.733
THE SHOOTING STARTS
AND YOU DUCK BEHIND ME,

03:41.767 --> 03:43.367
AND YOU'RE SORRY?
HE DUCKED BEHIND--
YOU DUCKED BEHIND HER?

03:43.400 --> 03:45.300
IT WAS INSTINCT.
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.100
DEB, HONEY,
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.067
LOVE MEANS NEVER HAVING
TO USE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

03:49.067 --> 03:50.400
AS A HUMAN SHIELD.

03:50.433 --> 03:52.067
(Neal) WE SHARED A BULLET.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.833
DEBORAH, IT WENT THROUGH YOU
AND INTO ME.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.333
THAT'S A SIGN WE SHOULD BE
TOGETHER FOREVER, A SIGN.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.067
NO, NEAL, THIS IS A SIGN.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.167
SHE IS SQUIRTING WATER
THROUGH MY ARM.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.433
LOOK. I CAN SEE YOU
THROUGH MY ARM.

04:02.467 --> 04:03.600
THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.300
GOOD LUCK.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.233
LOWER LEFT LEG DEFORMITY
FROM G.S.W.

04:08.267 --> 04:11.100
PEDAL PULSE IS STRONG
AND INTACT.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.067
PARAMEDIC SAID HE GOT 5
OF MORPHINE IN THE FIELD.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.267
OH, TRUST ME.
IT WAS NOT ENOUGH.
PROBABLY GOT THE TIBIA.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.433
RULE OUT OTHER INJURIES AND THEN
GET HIM UP TO RADIOLOGY.

04:17.467 --> 04:19.800
LET'S GET HER UP TO C.T.
GET AHOLD OF HER PARENTS

04:19.833 --> 04:22.133
AND GET 'EM DOWN HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.167
WHAT'S HER NAME, BY THE WAY?
(George) KENDRA.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.533
KENDRA THOMAS.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.400
KENDRA.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.767
(Izzie) ALMOST GOT IT.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.333
OHH! DO YOU
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

04:33.367 --> 04:35.433
BECAUSE THAT REALLY HURTS,
YOU KNOW?

04:35.467 --> 04:38.067
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY HURTS?
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.733
YOU'RE LUCKY.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.667
LUCKY? THERE'S NO LUCK.
QUICK THINKING, DOLL.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.167
EXCUSE ME?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.100
I'M A QUICK THINKER, SMART,
ALWAYS RIGHT ON IT.

04:45.133 --> 04:48.100
AS SOON AS I SAW HIM--PETEY--
HE'S THE SHOOTER... (chuckles)

04:48.133 --> 04:51.433
HEY, I KNEW WHEN I FIRED HIM
HE WAS NO GOOD.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.333
AS SOON AS I SAW HIM,
I THOUGHT, OH, HERE WE GO.

04:53.367 --> 04:54.333
I JUST KNEW WHAT WAS COMING.

04:54.367 --> 04:57.200
HEY, CHAZ, LARRY,
NO OFFENSE,

04:57.233 --> 04:59.267
BUT YOU GUYS GOTTA THINK QUICKER
ON YOUR FEET.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.400
(laughs)

05:00.433 --> 05:02.767
THEY HAVE GUNSHOT WOUNDS,

05:02.800 --> 05:04.667
VERY SERIOUS GUNSHOT WOUNDS,

05:04.700 --> 05:06.700
LIFE-THREATENING
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.567
IT REALLY HELPS
THAT I'M AN ATHLETE,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.100
'CAUSE THE SECOND I SAW PETEY
WITH THAT GUN,

05:11.133 --> 05:14.333
I WAS, LIKE, CAT-QUICK, JUST
DOVE RIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.300
THOSE GUYS... NOT SO SMART.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.200
I'M GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS

05:18.233 --> 05:20.267
AND SAY THAT PETEY
WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.833
YOU SEEN ANY ENEMA KITS?

05:24.867 --> 05:27.400
WE HAVE 13 G.S.W.s.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ENEMA KITS?

05:27.433 --> 05:29.233
I'M TRAPPED UPSTAIRS
WITH THE GYNO-BEAST

05:29.267 --> 05:31.667
ON THE UTERUS PARADE.
ADDISON CAN'T DO THIS
TO YOU FOREVER, ALEX.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.067
YOU WANNA BET?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.433
I SWEAR TO GOD,
SHE'S RUINING VAGINAS FOR ME.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.367
2 DEAD, 14 INJURED.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.300
THE POLICEMAN SAID
THE GUNMAN GOT AWAY,

05:39.333 --> 05:41.233
SO THERE COULD BE
MORE INCOMING.

05:41.267 --> 05:44.167
I COULD STAY.
WE COULD SEND BAILEY.
NO, NO.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.067
YOU'RE OUR ONLY CARDIOTHORACIC
TRANSPLANT SPECIALIST.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.300
YOU GO GET THAT HEART.

05:52.267 --> 05:56.333
OH, FORGET IT, KAREV.
I ALREADY ASKED.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.500
IT'S NOT GONNA... HAPPEN.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.633
(Alex) DR. BURKE!

06:00.667 --> 06:02.733
DR. BURKE!

06:02.767 --> 06:04.667
I HEARD YOU WERE GETTING
A HEART. CAN I GO WITH YOU?

06:04.700 --> 06:06.233
I ASKED FIRST.

06:06.267 --> 06:09.133
YOU DIDN'T GET ASSIGNED
ANY GUNSHOT CASES?

06:09.167 --> 06:12.067
WELL, YEAH, BUT IF YOU HAD
PUT ME ON THIS WHEN I ASKED,

06:12.067 --> 06:13.800
I WOULD'VE BEEN FREE.
I DIDN'T.
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.067
NO, HE'S ON THE GYNIE SQUAD.
NOT IF YOU PUT ME
ON THIS TRANSPLANT.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.200
PLEASE!

06:20.233 --> 06:22.100
LET'S GO, KAREV.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.500
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
WHOO! SEE YOU LATER, YANG.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.767
WHOO!

06:32.733 --> 06:35.100
SO WHO'S THE LUCKY PATIENT?

06:38.833 --> 06:42.067
DENNY DUQUETTE.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.167
THE ANSWER IS NO, STEVENS.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.100
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA ASK.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.267
YOU WANT TO HELP PREP
DENNY DUQUETTE FOR TRANSPLANT.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.200
SO IT'S TRUE?
HE'S GETTING A HEART THEN?

07:15.233 --> 07:17.700
SEE, YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:17.733 --> 07:20.067
YOU'RE OVERLY ATTACHED
TO YOUR PATIENT.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.533
SO THE ANSWER IS NO,
YOU CANNOT PREP HIM.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.067
GO BACK TO SUTURES.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.800
I KNOW
DENNY'S CARDIAC PARAMETERS.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.700
I KNOW HOW HIS LVAD WORKS
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER INTERN.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.633
I ALSO KNOW HIS MEDS BETTER.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.567
I KNOW THE FREQUENCY,
THE DOSAGE, THE QUANTITY

07:31.600 --> 07:33.267
AND HIS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.500
I PROMISE, I WILL--
I WILL BE 100% PROFESSIONAL.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.433
OH, NO FLIRTING,
NO KNITTING HIM SWEATERS,

07:38.467 --> 07:40.200
NO MARATHON GAMES OF SCRABBLE?

07:40.233 --> 07:43.067
I WILL TREAT HIM
WITH THE SAME PROTOCOL

07:43.100 --> 07:45.667
I WOULD ANY OTHER PATIENT.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.533
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.600
YOU CAN INFORM HIM
THE HEART'S COMING.
THANK YOU, DR. BAILEY.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.567
STEVENS...
THANK YOU.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.533
YOU SO MUCH AS SIT
ON THAT BED--
GOT IT!

08:01.167 --> 08:02.833
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

08:02.867 --> 08:04.767
YOU'RE AT WORK,
YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB,

08:04.800 --> 08:06.700
AND SOMEBODY COMES IN
AND SHOOTS YOU,

08:06.733 --> 08:08.633
JUST PUTS A BULLET
IN YOUR HEAD.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.767
19 YEARS OLD.
I CALLED HER PARENTS.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY, ALSO--

08:10.800 --> 08:13.267
GOOD, 'CAUSE WE NEED TO GET HER
INTO THE O.R. IMMEDIATELY.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.300
I MEAN, THE BULLET'S GONE
RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDLINE.
ALSO, UH...

08:15.333 --> 08:17.367
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THE HEMATOMA.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.333
ALSO?
WHAT?

08:19.367 --> 08:20.533
YOU SAID "ALSO" TWICE.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.333
YEAH, ALSO, SHE'S PREGNANT.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.300
(sighs)

08:25.333 --> 08:27.233
YEAH, I'M MANAGEMENT,
SO I'M 100% COVERED.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.167
SO I COULD SPEND A YEAR
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.067
IT WOULDN'T COST ME A CENT.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.833
THAT'S WHY WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT MANAGEMENT, CHAZ,

08:32.867 --> 08:35.733
YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO ME,
'CAUSE NOW, YOU'RE SCREWED.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.400
I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU JUST SPEND
ONE DAY IN THIS E.R.,

08:38.433 --> 08:40.333
THAT'S THREE... (whistles)
MONTHS RENT.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.267
YOU WANT TO BE
A 60-YEAR-OLD WAITER?

08:42.300 --> 08:44.200
IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU CAN
PLEASE UP MY MORPHINE?

08:44.233 --> 08:45.800
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
HEADING TOWARDS...
IF HE KEEPS TALKING,

08:45.833 --> 08:48.100
PRETTY SOON,
I'M GONNA NEED SOME.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.667
CAN YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT KENDRA FOR ME?

08:50.700 --> 08:52.167
ARE YOU TWO FRIENDS?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.633
NOT FRIENDS, EXACTLY.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.567
BUT, UH, EVERYBODY LIKES HER,
YOU KNOW?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.767
SHE'S--SHE'S JUST--
SHE'S NICE.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.700
SHE'LL COVER YOUR SHIFT
WHEN YOU NEED IT,

09:00.733 --> 09:02.633
SHE'S GOOD WITH THE CUSTOMERS,

09:02.667 --> 09:04.633
SHE'S REAL GENEROUS WHEN
IT COMES TO TIPPING BUSBOYS.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.567
LET ME GUESS,
YOU'RE A BUSBOY.
I AM.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.367
PLUS, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CALLS BRAD ON HIS CRAP.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.800
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

09:11.833 --> 09:14.667
YEAH, I WISH. I'M SAVING UP
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.167
I NEED THE JOB.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.633
WHAT, ARE YOU SOCIALIZING?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.800
I'VE GOT FIVE MORE PATIENTS
FOR YOU TO SEE,

09:19.833 --> 09:21.733
AND WILL HERE
NEEDS TO GET TO SURGERY.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.767
MOVE YOUR ASS.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.133
I NEED THE JOB.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.467
I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.400
AM I GETTING
A BETTER TELEVISION?

09:33.433 --> 09:35.533
'CAUSE THIS ONE
IS RIDICULOUSLY SMALL,

09:35.567 --> 09:37.467
AND IT DOESN'T GET
THE PORNY CHANNELS.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.767
YOU'RE GETTING A HEART,
DENNY.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.500
I DON'T MEAN TO BE DRAMATIC
AND ALL...

09:45.533 --> 09:48.400
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO REPEAT THAT.

09:48.433 --> 09:49.633
AND YOU SAY IT SLOW,

09:49.667 --> 09:52.533
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF
THOSE MOMENTS IN LIFE

09:52.567 --> 09:55.333
THAT I'M GONNA WANT
TO REMEMBER IN DETAIL.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.433
YOU...

09:57.467 --> 09:59.400
ARE GETTING A HEART

09:59.433 --> 10:01.267
FROM MERCY WEST.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.833
DR. BURKE ALREADY LEFT
TO GET IT.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.767
I GUESS THIS MEANS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO START

10:04.800 --> 10:06.633
TAKING YOU
ON SOME REAL DATES.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.733
I GUESS SO.
(laughs)

10:08.767 --> 10:10.600
HERE WE ARE,
MR. DUQUETTE.

10:12.567 --> 10:13.633
WHAT ARE THESE?

10:13.667 --> 10:15.300
D.N.R. PAPERS.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.167
DO NOT RESUSCITATE?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.100
(Patricia) I'LL LEAVE THESE HERE
AND COME BACK.

10:20.133 --> 10:21.400
(sighs)

10:21.433 --> 10:23.033
WHY ARE YOU SIGNING THESE?

10:23.067 --> 10:24.167
YOU'RE GETTING A HEART.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.833
IF THIS HEART DOESN'T
COME THROUGH FOR SOME REASON--

10:26.867 --> 10:28.833
IT WILL.
THE LAST ONE DIDN'T.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.767
YOU ARE ON AN LVAD, OKAY?

10:30.800 --> 10:34.400
THAT COULD GIVE YOU
ANOTHER TWO YEARS RIGHT THERE.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.733
IZZIE...

10:35.767 --> 10:38.500
IF I DON'T GET THIS HEART...

10:38.533 --> 10:39.700
I'M DONE.

10:39.733 --> 10:43.233
I'M... I'M JUST--
I'M TIRED.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.067
(sighs)

10:45.100 --> 10:46.167
NO.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.500
NO. I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
MAKE THIS DECISION, NOT NOW.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.733
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY
BECAUSE I THOUGHT D.N.R.

10:50.767 --> 10:53.233
WAS A PATIENT'S CHOICE.

10:56.067 --> 10:59.200
LISTEN TO ME...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.800
I BELIEVE IN HEAVEN,
IZZIE.

11:02.833 --> 11:06.300
AND IF I HAD TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN...

11:06.333 --> 11:08.767
THIS LIFE HERE...

11:10.400 --> 11:13.300
AND--AND ONE IN HEAVEN...

11:15.733 --> 11:17.600
I CHOOSE HEAVEN.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.767
OKAY?

11:19.800 --> 11:21.167
OKAY.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.067
OKAY.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.100
THE X-RAYS WILL TELL US
THE LOCATION OF THE BULLET.

11:31.133 --> 11:33.067
MINE WAS A THROUGH
AND THROUGH, RIGHT?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.067
SO THERE'S NO BULLET.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.233
YEAH, WELL, WE WANT TO
MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HIT BONE.
HOWEVER THIS TURNS OUT,

11:37.267 --> 11:39.067
I WANT YOU TO OPERATE
ON MY FIANCéE FIRST.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.300
I DON'T CARE IF I'M DYING.
YOU'RE NOT DYING.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.567
I'M ALSO NOT
YOUR FIANCéE ANYMORE.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.067
WE ALREADY SENT OUT
THE INVITATIONS.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.733
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
SIX WEEKS FROM NOW.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.800
DEBORAH, PLEASE.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.267
I LOVE YOU.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.233
(Cristina)
OH, DON'T FALL FOR IT.

11:54.267 --> 11:55.633
EXCUSE ME, BUT--
THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT,
HUH?

11:55.667 --> 11:57.567
WITH THE "I LOVE YOUS"
AND THE "MOVE IN WITH MES,"

11:57.600 --> 12:00.800
AND THEY SUCK YOU IN,
AND HE MELTS YOUR RESOLVE.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.300
AND THE MINUTE YOU ACTUALLY
NEED SOMETHING,

12:02.333 --> 12:04.333
SOMETHING YOU TOTALLY DESERVE,

12:04.367 --> 12:06.067
OH, FORGET IT. YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

12:06.067 --> 12:08.667
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
PASS YOU OVER FOR SURGERY

12:08.700 --> 12:11.100
OR THEY'RE GONNA DUCK BEHIND YOU
WHEN SOMEONE'S SHOOTING.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.433
YOU'RE VERY, VERY BITTER.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.567
(Neal) THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.733
SEE?
WE'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

12:16.767 --> 12:19.167
SHUT UP, NEAL.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.267
MM-HMM.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.067
(Preston)
THERE ARE TWO DONORS?

12:24.067 --> 12:26.767
TWO BROTHERS TRIED TO PASS
A SEMI ON A DOUBLE YELLOW

12:26.800 --> 12:28.700
AND CAME OUT ON THE LOSING END
OF A HEAD-ON.

12:28.733 --> 12:30.633
BOTH ARE A MATCH
FOR YOUR GUY.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.500
SO WE GET OUR PICK?
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.500
U.N.O.S. HAS ALREADY ASSIGNED
WHO GETS WHICH DONOR.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.600
(Alex) SO WHO'S RETRIEVING
THE OTHER HEART?

12:38.633 --> 12:41.267
(woman) TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH,
PRESTON.

12:42.533 --> 12:44.100
WHY IS JUNIOR HERE?

12:44.133 --> 12:46.300
YOUR EGO GET TOO BIG
FOR ONE MAN TO CARRY?

12:46.333 --> 12:49.300
(laughs) DR. HAHN HERE
GRADUATED SECOND

12:49.333 --> 12:52.167
IN OUR CLASS
AT JOHNS HOPKINS, DR. KAREV.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.200
ASK HER WHO GRADUATED FIRST.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.633
(whispers) GOD.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.400
(Addison) KENDRA'S FETUS
IS 12 WEEKS ALONG.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.600
SEEMS HEALTHY.

13:03.633 --> 13:05.500
DID YOU HEAR ME, DEREK?

13:05.533 --> 13:06.800
I HEARD YOU.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.800
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON

13:10.833 --> 13:12.133
BETWEEN YOU AND MEREDITH?

13:12.167 --> 13:15.367
I TOLD YOU,
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
KENDRA'S PARENTS ARE HERE.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.200
LET THEM KNOW THE SITUATION,
SIGN THE CONSENT FORMS

13:18.233 --> 13:20.133
AND THEN SCRUB IN.
YES, DR. SHEPHERD.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.800
THANK YOU.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.600
(monitors beeping erratically)

13:28.633 --> 13:30.533
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO MY DONOR?

13:30.567 --> 13:32.400
(woman)
HE WENT INTO V-FIB.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.067
I CAN SEE THAT.
GIVE ME THE PADDLES.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.333
KAREV, TAKE OVER COMPRESSIONS.
YOU GAVE EPI?

13:36.367 --> 13:38.267
THREE ROUNDS.
AND WE SHOCKED HIM TWICE.

13:38.300 --> 13:42.067
I'M GONNA HIT HIM AGAIN
AT 360. CLEAR.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.833
HE'S ASYSTOLIC.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.700
I DON'T GET IT.
THE GUY'S ALREADY DEAD.

13:48.733 --> 13:51.433
AND NOW HIS HEART
HAS JOINED THE REST OF HIM.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.600
SO WE CAN'T USE IT?

13:52.633 --> 13:54.667
NO, KAREV,
WE CANNOT USE IT.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.233
THE MUSCLE IS DEAD.
THE HEART IS USELESS.

13:58.267 --> 14:01.367
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

14:02.767 --> 14:05.067
(Alex) DR. BURKE.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.267
OH, MY GOD!

14:06.300 --> 14:08.767
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!
STOP RIGHT NOW.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.700
DON'T MOVE THAT SCALPEL,

14:10.733 --> 14:12.700
NOT EVEN A SINGLE SLICE.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.367
JUST BECAUSE YOUR DONOR'S
HEART DIED

14:21.400 --> 14:24.700
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO
GIVE YOU MINE.
IS YOUR PATIENT HIGHER
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.600
IS HE HIGHER
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST?

14:26.633 --> 14:27.833
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.500
WELL, NEITHER DO I.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.667
KAREV, GET U.N.O.S.
ON THE PHONE, NOW.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.367
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.267
HEY, HEY.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.433
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
BEAT HIM UP?

14:38.467 --> 14:39.633
IF I HAVE TO.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.333
OKAY, JUST HOLD ON.

14:41.367 --> 14:45.300
PATHETIC, PRESTON.
REALLY PATHETIC.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.733
I FINISHED ALL FIVE
OF YOUR PATIENTS.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.833
DO YOU MIND
IF I SCRUB IN?

14:51.867 --> 14:53.767
I'VE NEVER SEEN
AN O.R.I.F. BEFORE.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.733
CAN'T. THE BOARD'S
ALL BACKED UP LIKE CRAZY.

14:55.767 --> 14:58.400
WILL'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
A FEW HOURS

14:58.433 --> 14:59.767
'CAUSE EVERY OTHER SPECIALTY
THINKS THEIR SURGERIES

14:59.800 --> 15:01.467
ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ORTHO.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.400
FREAKIN' SUPERIOR,
MACHO JERKS.

15:04.433 --> 15:07.300
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION
ABOUT BONE CANCER?

15:07.333 --> 15:08.700
YEAH.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.067
IN A DOG.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.100
A DOG?
MY DOG.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.067
WELL, DEREK'S DOG.
DO YOU KNOW DR. SHEPHERD?

15:15.067 --> 15:16.533
IT'S OUR DOG.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.733
WE SHARE THE DOG,
WHICH IS--WELL, NEVER MIND.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.633
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
IF YOU KNEW THE SUCCESS RATE

15:21.667 --> 15:24.400
OF CURING OSTEOSARCOMA
IN A CANINE LEG.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.467
WE HAVE AN ACTUAL HUMAN PATIENT
WITH A-A BULLET

15:29.500 --> 15:31.200
LODGED IN HIS TIBIA,

15:31.233 --> 15:33.733
WHO MIGHT WALK WITH A LIMP
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

15:33.767 --> 15:35.667
WHO MIGHT EVEN CONCEIVABLY
LOSE HIS LEG,

15:35.700 --> 15:38.533
AND YOU'RE ASKING ME
ABOUT YOUR PRECIOUS DOG

15:38.567 --> 15:40.233
THAT YOU SHARE WITH
YOUR PRECIOUS McDREAMY?

15:40.267 --> 15:43.733
YEAH, I-I KNOW ABOUT HIM.
AND YOU THINK I CARE?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.667
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.533
(Hahn) YOUR GUY'S ON AN LVAD.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.267
HE'S PROBABLY UP
AND WALKING AROUND.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.067
MY GUY STILL NEEDS
HIS DOBUTAMINE DRIP.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.367
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

15:54.400 --> 15:58.167
HE CAN CLIMB MOUNT SHASTA
ON A DOBUTAMINE DRIP.
(man) As of this morning,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.733
Dr. Hahn's patient was
22 hundredths of a point ahead.

16:00.767 --> 16:02.100
WELL, THAT'S BASICALLY A TIE.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.533
Except that Dr. Hahn's patient
was admitted

16:04.567 --> 16:06.467
into the transplant program
before Mr. Duquette.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.067
HOW LONG BEFORE?

16:10.433 --> 16:11.600
17 seconds.

16:11.633 --> 16:14.367
17 SECONDS.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.400
MIGHT AS WELL BE 17 WEEKS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.367
(cell phone rings)

16:21.867 --> 16:23.633
HELLO.
Alex?

16:23.667 --> 16:25.067
WHERE'S DR. BURKE?
What do you want?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.733
I WANT TO KNOW HOW
THE HEART RECOVERY IS GOING.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.767
HE'S WORKING ON IT.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.700
"He's working on it"?
So he's operating now?

16:31.733 --> 16:33.667
THERE WERE TWO DONORS, IZZIE.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.967
Our guy's heart flatlined,

16:35.067 --> 16:37.733
and now he's trying
to get the other guy's.
BUT THERE'S A LIST.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.533
YES, AND THE HIGHER GUY
GETS THE HEART.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.333
DENNY'S GETTING SICKER.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.100
WHAT?

16:45.133 --> 16:47.200
DENNY'S GETTING WORSE
BY THE SECOND.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.133
His, uh, his sats
are in the 80s.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.100
IZZIE.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.233
70s.

16:51.267 --> 16:53.167
HIS SATS ARE NOW
IN THE 70s AND DROPPING.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.733
Izzie, I'm not
gonna lie for you.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.800
THEN PUT BURKE
ON THE PHONE.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.600
HEY.

17:00.633 --> 17:01.567
HEY.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.300
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. KAREV?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.567
UH... HOURS AGO.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.367
OKAY.

17:10.433 --> 17:12.633
SORRY. I, UH...

17:12.667 --> 17:15.067
I'M--I'M NOT SORRY.
I JUST--

17:15.067 --> 17:16.200
I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE

17:16.233 --> 17:18.133
BECAUSE I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.067
AND I DON'T USUALLY
HAVE TROUBLE,

17:20.100 --> 17:21.667
BUT WHAT I NEED TO ASK,

17:21.700 --> 17:24.300
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I WANT THE ANSWER TO.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.300
BUT I HAVE TO ASK,
SO I'M JUST GONNA ASK YOU,

17:26.333 --> 17:27.600
AND THEN YOU ANSWER,

17:27.633 --> 17:30.267
AND THEN, UM...
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE, OKAY?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.333
OKAY.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.200
ARE YOU SLEEPING
WITH MY HUSBAND?

17:34.233 --> 17:37.800
NOT SINCE BEFORE I KNEW
HE WAS MARRIED.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.767
OKAY.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.400
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, IT JUST--

17:43.433 --> 17:45.667
IT FELT LIKE--
IN THE VET'S OFFICE

17:45.700 --> 17:47.767
THIS MORNING AND THEN AGAIN
IN THE ELEVATOR--

17:47.800 --> 17:52.100
IT FELT A LITTLE LIKE YOU TWO
WERE HAVING A LOVERS' QUARREL?

17:52.133 --> 17:54.267
NO, WE'RE NOT.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.700
I'VE MOVED ON.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.233
I'M DATING FINN.

17:58.267 --> 18:02.067
YOU'RE DATING THE VET?

18:04.800 --> 18:05.833
OKAY.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.400
ADDISON...

18:07.433 --> 18:10.500
NO, NO, THANKS. I'M--I'M GOOD.
THANKS. I'M GREAT.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.233
(sighs)

18:14.267 --> 18:16.100
(Preston)
Flash pulmonary edema?

18:16.133 --> 18:19.067
Is--is it the LVAD?
Is the LVAD working?
ABSOLUTELY.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.233
WELL, DID YOU PUT HIM
ON A NITRO DRIP?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.167
UM, I... YES.
YES, OF COURSE.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.833
PRESTON, SHE COULD BE PUTTING
PADDLES DIRECTLY ON HIS HEART.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.067
HE'S STILL NOT GETTING
THIS THING.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.067
How's his blood pressure?
IT'S, UH, STILL DROPPING.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.433
82 OVER 40.
Then take him off the drip
and put him on dopamine, now.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.600
DON'T HANG UP.

18:34.633 --> 18:38.500
ACCORDING TO MY INTERN,
DENNY DUQUETTE NOW QUALIFIES

18:38.533 --> 18:40.533
AS A 1A CANDIDATE
FOR THAT HEART.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.200
THAT PUTS HIM AHEAD
OF DR. HAHN'S PATIENT.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.133
I'M OUTTA HERE.
THIS IS JUST CRAP.
(man) Dr. Hahn.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.067
WHAT?
If Dr. Burke
wants to run labs,

18:47.100 --> 18:49.133
do an echo and a B.N.P.
to fully ascertain

18:49.167 --> 18:51.800
the status of his patient,
we'll allow it.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.067
THAT'LL TAKE AN HOUR.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.467
Is the donor stable?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.400
Dr. Hahn,
is the donor stable?

18:57.433 --> 18:59.767
YES, THE DONOR
IS CURRENTLY STABLE.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.067
In that case, Dr. Burke, you've
got an hour to get those tests.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.433
DR. STEVENS.

19:04.467 --> 19:06.167
I HEARD.
Good.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.467
GET GOING THEN.

19:20.567 --> 19:21.733
B.P.'s 220 OVER 130.

19:21.767 --> 19:23.667
THE BRAIN IS FUNGATING
OUT OF THE WOUND.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.767
WHAT'S FUNGATING?
HERNIATING.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.300
(woman)
SHE'S BRADYCARDIC.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.133
LET ME GET 50 MANNITOL
AND 20 FUROSEMIDE.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.833
WHAT'S HER PULSE?
DOWN TO 32.

19:31.867 --> 19:34.800
COME ON, KENDRA. CO2?

19:34.833 --> 19:36.200
40.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.667
OH, GOD.
THE CLOT'S ALREADY EVACUATED.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.600
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
BUT--

19:41.633 --> 19:44.767
SHE'S BRAIN DEAD.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO NOW.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.067
THERE IS NO SPONTANEOUS
BRAIN ACTIVITY,

19:48.067 --> 19:50.200
AND SHE ISN'T GOING TO
WAKE UP.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.533
OH, GOD.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.400
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?
IS THE BABY OKAY?

19:54.433 --> 19:57.367
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL,
THE BABY'S FINE, BUT...

19:57.400 --> 19:59.100
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.233
ESSENTIALLY,
YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.767
WE NEED YOUR CONSENT TO
REMOVE HER FROM LIFE SUPPORT.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.667
WHAT IF WE KEPT KENDRA ALIVE?

20:06.700 --> 20:07.800
COULD THE BABY LIVE?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.733
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.267
ARE YOU PART OF THIS FAMILY?
DO YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER?

20:13.300 --> 20:15.533
IF YOU DON'T, YOU REALLY
OUGHTA JUST SHUT UP.

20:15.567 --> 20:19.400
OUR DAUGHTER...
COULD HAVE THIS BABY?

20:21.200 --> 20:23.100
YOU KNOW, EVEN WITH
ALL THESE CUTS,

20:23.133 --> 20:24.433
I DON'T FEEL ANY PAIN.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.367
I SWEAR, I HAVE
THE HIGHEST PAIN THRESHOLD

20:26.400 --> 20:28.300
OF ANYBODY I KNOW. (slurping)

20:28.333 --> 20:30.233
MY GOD. IF I COULD
SAY SOMETHING TO THAT GUY

20:30.267 --> 20:31.700
AND NOT GET FIRED...

20:31.733 --> 20:34.433
HE CAN'T FIRE ME.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.667
UH, MR. ECKLES, BRAD,

20:36.700 --> 20:40.300
UH, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU THAT
YOU'RE NOT FEELING MUCH PAIN

20:40.333 --> 20:42.500
FROM YOUR VERY MINOR INJURIES,
BUT THERE ARE

20:42.533 --> 20:44.433
A GREAT MANY PEOPLE
IN THIS HOSPITAL

20:44.467 --> 20:46.800
WHO ARE IN A GREAT AMOUNT
OF PAIN.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.667
SEE, THEY HAVE BULLETS
IN THEIR BONES,

20:48.700 --> 20:50.600
IN THEIR CHESTS
AND IN THEIR BRAINS,

20:50.633 --> 20:52.267
BULLETS FROM A GUN
THAT WAS AIMING FOR YOU.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.433
AND ALTHOUGH THEY CAN'T SAY IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BOSS OF THEM,

20:54.467 --> 20:56.733
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE,
AT THIS MOMENT,

20:56.767 --> 20:58.733
ARE PRAYING--
NOT THAT THEY'LL LIVE,

20:58.767 --> 21:00.500
NOT THAT THE PAIN
WILL SUBSIDE--

21:00.533 --> 21:03.400
THEY'RE PRAYING TO GOD
FOR YOU, AT THIS MOMENT,

21:03.433 --> 21:05.400
TO SHUT THE HECK UP.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.167
(mouths words)

21:12.200 --> 21:15.267
NO PROBLEM.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.133
KAREV. HE STOOD THERE
AND CHOOSE THAT MORON OVER ME.

21:18.167 --> 21:20.067
YOU KNOW,
I'M TRYING TO HELP THE DOG,

21:20.100 --> 21:21.567
AND HE'S STANDING THERE

21:21.600 --> 21:23.500
TALKING ABOUT
PUTTING THE DOG DOWN,

21:23.533 --> 21:24.667
LIKE DOC MEANS NOTHING.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.567
HE'S NOT REWARDING KAREV.
HE'S PUNISHING ME.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.433
AND HE HATES FINN, WHO,
BY THE WAY, IS GREAT WITH DOGS.

21:30.467 --> 21:32.367
HE WITHHOLDS SURGERY
WHEN I'M A BAD GIRLFRIEND.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.233
IT'S HIS M.O.

21:34.267 --> 21:35.767
I MEAN, HOW CONTROLLING

21:35.800 --> 21:37.600
AND MACHO AND PETULANT
IS THAT?

21:37.633 --> 21:39.533
AT LEAST
HE'S NOT SHOOTING PEOPLE

21:39.567 --> 21:41.567
OR PUTTING DOWN DOGS.
(Cristina) I'M DUMPING HIM.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.667
THIS RELATIONSHIP
IS SO OVER.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.700
UM, I-I TOLD A LIE...
TO DR. BURKE.

21:50.733 --> 21:53.233
GOOD FOR YOU.
FIGHT THE POWER.

21:53.267 --> 21:54.433
NO, NO, I NEED... UM...

21:54.467 --> 21:56.367
GOD, I CAN'T THINK.
I-I CAN'T...

21:56.400 --> 21:59.667
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO I DO?

21:59.700 --> 22:02.733
THERE'S THIS GUY AHEAD OF DENNY
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

22:02.767 --> 22:05.533
(sighs) HE'LL GET
THE NEXT HEART, IZ.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.600
NO! HE NEEDS
TO GET THIS HEART.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.367
HE'LL PROBABLY GET A HEART
AT SOME POINT,

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
BUT AS LONG AS DENNY'S
DOING WELL ON THE LVAD

22:15.433 --> 22:17.633
AND THERE'S SOMEONE AHEAD OF HIM
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST,

22:17.667 --> 22:19.333
HE'S NOT GONNA GET
THIS HEART.

22:19.367 --> 22:21.167
OKAY?

22:22.867 --> 22:25.267
YES.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.067
YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.067
THANK YOU.

22:29.067 --> 22:32.133
THANK YOU. (mutters)

22:32.167 --> 22:34.067
OKAY, IF I WAS GONNA
PICK SOMEONE

22:34.100 --> 22:36.600
WHO WAS GONNA GO PSYCHO
AND SHOOT UP THE PLACE...

22:38.500 --> 22:40.167
IT'S IZZIE.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.233
TOTALLY.

22:44.867 --> 22:47.767
WHAT'S ALL THAT?
HEART STUFF.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.333
SO YOU'RE GONNA PUT THIS HEART
IN ME IN MY ROOM?

22:50.367 --> 22:53.333
I DIDN'T KNOW TRANSPLANTS
WERE SO INFORMAL.

22:55.133 --> 22:57.600
THERE--THERE MAY NOT
BE A HEART, DENNY.

22:57.633 --> 23:00.733
SOMEBODY AT MERCY WEST
MIGHT GET IT INSTEAD.

23:00.767 --> 23:05.300
SO THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN...
AGAIN.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.333
NOT NECESSARILY.

23:09.433 --> 23:12.767
I HAVE BEEN OVER THIS
AND OVER THIS,

23:12.800 --> 23:16.067
AND IT CAN'T BE A LIE
AND IT CAN'T BE FAKE.

23:16.067 --> 23:18.133
WE NEED CHARTS.
WE NEED TEST RESULTS.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.400
WE NEED U.N.O.S. TO BELIEVE US,
SO IT HAS TO BE REAL.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.233
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
IZZIE?

23:24.267 --> 23:27.400
IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO GET THE HEART,

23:27.433 --> 23:30.300
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET WORSE--
MUCH WORSE--

23:30.333 --> 23:32.233
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IT
VERY QUICKLY.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.167
WELL, I-I DON'T
SEE THAT HAPPENING.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.067
YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.733
I AM GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN.

23:56.467 --> 23:59.333
IT'S BEEN 30 MINUTES ALREADY.
IS STEVENS ANSWERING HER PAGE?

23:59.367 --> 24:01.267
SHE'S PROBABLY BUSY GETTING
THE TEST RESULTS.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.600
YOU CALL BAILEY?

24:02.633 --> 24:06.400
UH, SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
EITHER.

24:06.433 --> 24:09.167
YOU CAN CHECK THE CHART
ALL YOU WANT,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.500
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS HEART.
WELL, YOU MAY NOT
WANT IT.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.733
HIS ANGIOGRAM SHOWS
30% L.A.D.

24:13.767 --> 24:17.067
STILL NOT ENOUGH
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.433
IZZIE.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.300
IZZIE, STOP AND LISTEN TO ME.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.667
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.167
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.100
I WILL BE HERE THE WHOLE TIME
TO MAKE SURE OF THAT,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.767
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS STUFF IS FOR.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.833
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME DYING,
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS WRONG.

24:31.867 --> 24:33.333
YOU HAVE WAITED A YEAR
AND A HALF TO GET THIS THING.

24:33.367 --> 24:35.600
WHO KNOWS WHEN THE NEXT ONE
IS GONNA COME ALONG?
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

24:35.633 --> 24:38.633
NO! IT MAY BE
TOO LATE BY THEN.
THEN IT'S TOO LATE,
ALL RIGHT?

24:38.667 --> 24:40.100
NOW GET THIS STUFF
OUTTA HERE.
DENNY...

24:40.133 --> 24:43.067
PLEASE...
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.300
NO, IZZIE.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.233
I'M NOT ABOUT TO STEAL A HEART
FROM ANOTHER MAN'S CHEST.

24:47.267 --> 24:49.633
NOT TO MENTION, THIS WILL BE
THE END OF YOUR MEDICAL CAREER.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.567
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT MY MEDICAL CAREER.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.500
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.267
I'M GONNA CALL A NURSE.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.200
EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED INTO
THE TRANSPLANT PROGRAM

24:57.233 --> 24:59.633
IS CLOCKED IN TO THE SECOND.
TO THE SECOND, DENNY.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.833
YOU WERE CLOCKED IN
TO THE SECOND,

25:01.867 --> 25:04.100
AND SO WAS THE OTHER GUY,
I CHECKED WITH U.N.O.S.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.667
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WHEN YOU ENTERED THE PROGRAM

25:06.700 --> 25:08.767
AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE PROGRAM
IS 17 SECONDS.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.500
THAT'S IT, DENNY.
17 SECONDS.

25:11.533 --> 25:15.267
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN
THE LENGTH OF A DECENT KISS.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.367
SO THIS OTHER GUY--

25:16.400 --> 25:19.800
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THIS HEART.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.733
I'M SURE HE DOES,

25:21.767 --> 25:24.333
BUT SO DO YOU.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.500
AND IF YOU TELL ME
ANY MORE CRAP

25:27.533 --> 25:29.433
ABOUT HEADING TOWARDS
THE LIGHT

25:29.467 --> 25:31.367
OR LOOKING DOWN ON ME
FROM HEAVEN,

25:31.400 --> 25:33.733
I SWEAR, I WILL
KILL YOU MYSELF RIGHT NOW!

25:33.767 --> 25:36.600
IZZIE...

25:38.533 --> 25:41.700
JUST...
I'M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

25:41.733 --> 25:45.167
ALL RIGHT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.600
WHAT ABOUT ME?

25:47.633 --> 25:50.500
WHAT ABOUT ME
WHEN YOU GO TO THE LIGHT?

25:50.533 --> 25:52.533
IZZIE--
NO, I GET IT...

25:52.567 --> 25:54.667
IZZIE--
OKAY? I GET IT.
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.767
YOU'LL BE FINE.
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

25:56.800 --> 26:01.167
SO DON'T DO IT FOR YOURSELF.
DO IT FOR ME, PLEASE.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.100
PLEASE, DENNY.
PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.500
BECAUSE IF YOU DIE--

26:04.533 --> 26:06.467
OH, GOD,
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.700
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FOR ME,

26:08.733 --> 26:11.300
OR I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE YOU.
FOR DYING?

26:11.333 --> 26:14.800
NO! FOR MAKING ME LOVE YOU.
PLEASE.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.100
(sobs) PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME.
COME HERE.

26:17.133 --> 26:19.433
OKAY? PLEASE.

26:19.467 --> 26:21.767
OKAY? I CAN'T DO THIS
IF YOU DON'T.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.500
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THIS--
PLEASE.

26:25.533 --> 26:27.067
(sobs) OKAY?

26:27.100 --> 26:28.467
OKAY.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.200
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

26:31.233 --> 26:34.267
(sobbing)

26:34.300 --> 26:36.200
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF ANALYZING AN X-RAY,

26:36.233 --> 26:39.100
AND YOUR FRIEND MEREDITH
STARTS ASKING ME ABOUT HER DOG.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.467
HER DOG, GEORGE.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.400
SHE WANTS A MEDICAL OPINION
ABOUT HER DOG.

26:42.433 --> 26:45.267
SHE LIKES HER DOG.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.200
WHY ARE YOU
DEFENDING MEREDITH?

26:47.233 --> 26:50.300
WHAT?
I GET IZZIE.
I MEAN, I-I DON'T,

26:50.333 --> 26:52.500
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
DEFEND IZZIE, THAT'S FINE.

26:52.533 --> 26:55.367
I-I DON'T GET
HOW YOU CAN DEFEND MEREDITH.
HEY.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.300
WE'RE INTERNS.
WE ALL STARTED OUT TOGETHER.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.667
MEREDITH, IZZIE,
CRISTINA AND ME--

26:58.700 --> 26:59.900
WE STARTED OUT TOGETHER.

27:00.067 --> 27:03.100
GEORGE, THAT WOMAN HURT YOU
AS BADLY AS ANYONE CAN BE HURT.

27:03.133 --> 27:05.067
YOU WERE DEVASTATED
WHEN I MET YOU.

27:05.067 --> 27:08.667
LOOK... THEY'RE FAMILY.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.633
IZZIE AND MEREDITH
AND CRISTINA--

27:10.667 --> 27:12.567
THEY'RE--THEY'RE MY FAMILY.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.467
I CAN HATE MEREDITH, AND I
CAN--I CAN BE ANGRY AT HER,

27:15.500 --> 27:17.433
BUT I'M ALWAYS
GONNA DEFEND HER.

27:17.467 --> 27:20.300
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FORGIVE MEREDITH, BUT I DO?

27:20.333 --> 27:23.633
IF YOU WANT A CHANCE
TO BE PART OF THE FAMILY, YEAH.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.533
(Izzie) DR. BURKE, HELLO.

27:26.567 --> 27:28.467
Stevens, where the hell
have you been?

27:28.500 --> 27:30.467
Have you got the lab results?

27:30.500 --> 27:32.600
UM... AHEM.
I'M WORKING ON THAT.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.167
STEVENS, I NEED ANSWERS.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.533
STEVENS?

27:35.567 --> 27:37.467
You should get back here
with the heart

27:37.500 --> 27:39.067
as soon as you can.

27:39.067 --> 27:42.067
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU...
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:42.067 --> 27:43.267
PRESTON...

27:43.300 --> 27:44.800
IZZIE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

27:44.833 --> 27:46.733
As soon as I get
confirmatory tests and labs

27:46.767 --> 27:48.667
to raise
Denny's U.N.O.S. status,

27:48.700 --> 27:50.600
I will fax them over to you,

27:50.633 --> 27:52.533
AND THEN YOU SHOULD WASTE
NO TIME IN GETTING BACK HERE

27:52.567 --> 27:54.067
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH

27:54.067 --> 27:56.800
TO KNOW HOW LONG
DENNY WILL HAVE ONCE I START.

27:56.833 --> 27:59.333
START?

27:59.367 --> 28:02.167
What did you do, Izzie?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.533
WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:03.567 --> 28:06.433
I'm going to hang up now.
Just hurry.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.267
(line disconnects)

28:18.700 --> 28:20.400
ACCORDING TO MY INTERN,

28:20.433 --> 28:22.733
DENNY DUQUETTE IS
IN PULMONARY EDEMA,

28:22.767 --> 28:24.467
AND HE HAS BEEN INTUBATED

28:24.500 --> 28:26.100
AND PLACED ON
MULTIPLE I.V. DRIPS.

28:26.133 --> 28:28.500
SO PRESTON GETS THE HEART.
GREAT. LET'S OPEN THIS GUY.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.833
HOWEVER... GIVEN THIS
UNUSUAL SITUATION,

28:30.867 --> 28:32.700
AND OUT OF RESPECT
TO DR. HAHN,

28:32.733 --> 28:35.533
I'D LIKE TO CONFIRM
THOSE RESULTS.
YOU--YOU JUST DID.

28:35.567 --> 28:37.200
IN PERSON.

28:37.233 --> 28:39.700
I WANT TO CONFIRM THEM
IN PERSON.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.767
(Hahn) ARE YOU KIDDING?
BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE,

28:41.800 --> 28:43.333
IT'LL BE ANOTHER HOUR.

28:43.367 --> 28:45.767
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, BURKE?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.700
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TALK
TO YOUR CHIEF,

28:47.733 --> 28:49.600
CONFIRM THE RESULTS
WITH HIM?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.433
WELL, BECAUSE OF
THE SHOOTINGS TODAY

28:55.467 --> 28:57.267
AT THE RESTAURANT, UH,

28:57.300 --> 28:58.767
ALL OUR ATTENDINGS
ARE STILL IN SURGERY.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.233
EXACTLY.

29:00.267 --> 29:02.067
NOW IF YOU PREFER,
I CAN JUST CALL U.N.O.S.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.600
AND HAVE THEM GIVE ME
THE HEART.

29:04.633 --> 29:07.633
OR I CAN GO AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT REALLY BELONGS TO ME.

29:10.267 --> 29:11.567
GO.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.533
THANK YOU.

29:16.433 --> 29:18.333
I'M GOING BACK
TO SEATTLE GRACE.

29:18.367 --> 29:20.267
YOU STAY HERE
AND PROTECT MY HEART.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.200
IF THAT WOMAN SO MUCH
AS LOOKS AT A SCALPEL,

29:22.233 --> 29:23.600
TACKLE HER.

29:23.633 --> 29:25.100
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:25.133 --> 29:26.600
YES, SIR.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.533
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

29:30.567 --> 29:31.600
ARE YOU READY TO TALK?

29:31.633 --> 29:33.667
UH, MY PATIENT, KENDRA THOMAS,
SHE'S BRAIN DEAD.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.600
HER PARENTS WANT TO KEEP HER
ALIVE TO HAVE THE BABY.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.067
SO YOU WANT ME TO TALK
TO THE PARENTS?

29:38.067 --> 29:39.800
WELL, I TRIED ALREADY,
BUT I FIGURED, YOU'RE NEONATAL.

29:39.833 --> 29:42.333
YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER SHOT
AT IT THAN I DO.
OKAY.

29:42.367 --> 29:44.400
IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN GIVE THEM
A MUCH MORE DETAILED PICTURE--
I SAID I'D DO IT.

29:44.433 --> 29:46.833
MR. AND MRS. THOMAS,
DR. SHEPHERD ASKED ME

29:46.867 --> 29:48.767
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER

29:48.800 --> 29:51.533
AND HER PREGNANCY.
WE'VE MADE UP OUR MINDS.
SHE'S HAVING THE BABY.

29:51.567 --> 29:54.267
I KNOW KENDRA MEANT
THE WORLD TO YOU,

29:54.300 --> 29:55.767
AND I KNOW
THE TERRIBLE GRIEF

29:55.800 --> 29:58.233
YOU MUST BE GOING THROUGH
RIGHT NOW.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.533
BUT FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT,
THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.467
WELL, IF WE'D WANTED
YOUR OPINION, MISS,

30:02.500 --> 30:04.200
WE'D ASK FOR IT.

30:04.233 --> 30:06.133
IT'S JUST--WE--
WE LOVE OUR DAUGHTER.

30:06.167 --> 30:07.333
PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

30:07.367 --> 30:09.667
I DO UNDERSTAND.
I DO.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.533
YOU THINK
IF YOU LOVE HER ENOUGH

30:11.567 --> 30:13.467
OR LOVE HER BABY ENOUGH,
THAT IT WILL

30:13.500 --> 30:14.633
KEEP HER CLOSE TO YOU.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.100
BUT SHE'S ALREADY GONE, AND IF
YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS,

30:17.133 --> 30:18.667
YOU'RE RISKING--

30:18.700 --> 30:21.167
WELL, I MEAN, IF KENDRA WERE
TO CONTRACT AN INFECTION,

30:21.200 --> 30:23.100
SHE COULD PASS IT ON
TO THE FETUS.

30:23.133 --> 30:24.600
IT COULD CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE--
WE'RE TAKING OUR CHANCES.

30:24.633 --> 30:29.400
THEY KEEP ORGAN DONORS ALIVE
AFTER THEY'RE GONE.

30:29.433 --> 30:31.100
WHY NOT KENDRA?

30:31.133 --> 30:33.667
ORGAN DONORS ARE NOT
KEPT ALIVE FOR SIX MONTHS.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.167
YOUR DAUGHTER IS BRAIN DEAD.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.567
SHE CAN'T REGULATE
BODY TEMPERATURE,

30:36.600 --> 30:38.067
HORMONE OUTPUT.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.633
THESE THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
FOR A FETUS.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.667
YOU GUYS CAN REGULATE
THAT STUFF, RIGHT?
WE COULD TRY. I--

30:43.700 --> 30:46.200
WELL, THEN TRY, DAMN IT! WHAT
THE HELL'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

30:46.233 --> 30:48.133
THE PROBLEM HERE, AS I SEE IT,
IS YOU WANT TO USE

30:48.167 --> 30:49.267
YOUR DAUGHTER'S CORPSE
AS AN INCUBATOR.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.833
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(Derek) OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

30:50.867 --> 30:52.467
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US, PLEASE?
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
DEREK? LET GO OF ME.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.200
THOSE PEOPLE JUST LOST
THEIR DAUGHTER.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.133
I KNOW.
THAT WAS MY POINT, DEREK.

30:56.167 --> 30:58.067
THEY NEED TO FACE THAT.
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.833
A LITTLE SENSITIVITY
WOULD BE NICE HERE, OKAY?

30:59.867 --> 31:01.767
THEY LOVE THEIR DAUGHTER.
THEY DON'T WANT TO LET GO.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.667
ALL RIGHT?
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IS NOT ABOUT LOVE, DEREK.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.800
IT'S--IT'S--
WELL, IT'S LIKE YOU.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.267
EXCUSE ME?
YEAH.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.133
LIKE HOW YOU PRETEND
TO LOVE ME,

31:10.167 --> 31:12.067
BUT REALLY, YOU'RE JUST USING ME
TO FILL SOME NEED YOU HAVE

31:12.100 --> 31:13.833
TO BE A GOOD GUY.
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

31:13.867 --> 31:16.333
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.
OH, WHAT, YOU WALK AWAY?
THAT'S ALL I GET?

31:16.367 --> 31:17.433
JUST CALM DOWN, PLEASE.

31:17.467 --> 31:19.833
WHAT? WHAT? YOU'RE NOT GONNA
YELL AT ME, CALL ME NAMES,

31:19.867 --> 31:22.333
OR, I-I DON'T KNOW,
IGNORE ME IN AN ELEVATOR?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, ADDISON?

31:22.367 --> 31:23.733
I WANT YOU TO CARE.

31:23.767 --> 31:26.100
I SLEEP WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND,
AND YOU WALK AWAY.

31:26.133 --> 31:28.833
HE COMES OUT HERE FROM NEW YORK
AND RUBS IT IN YOUR FACE,

31:28.867 --> 31:31.233
AND STILL, YOU GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

31:31.267 --> 31:33.167
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
OH, I KNOW.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.467
MAYBE WHAT I SHOULD DO IS GO OUT
ON A DATE WITH THE VET,

31:36.500 --> 31:38.400
BECAUSE THAT
SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING

31:38.433 --> 31:40.333
THAT SENDS YOU
INTO A BLIND RAGE.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.267
OH, BUT WAIT,
THAT WON'T WORK EITHER,

31:42.300 --> 31:44.067
BECAUSE I'M NOT MEREDITH GREY.

32:09.433 --> 32:11.767
I KNOW THIS IS A BAD TIME,

32:11.800 --> 32:13.700
BUT HAVE YOU DECIDED
IF YOU STILL WANT

32:13.733 --> 32:15.833
TO GO AHEAD WITH THE BABY?

32:15.867 --> 32:20.067
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED
ON ANYTHING.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.433
SIR...

32:24.467 --> 32:27.067
YOU ASKED ME BEFORE
IF I HAD A DAUGHTER.

32:27.067 --> 32:28.800
I DON'T, BUT I HAVE A FAMILY.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.733
I ACTUALLY HAVE
A COUPLE OF FAMILIES.

32:30.767 --> 32:32.233
THE THING ABOUT FAMILY

32:32.267 --> 32:35.767
IS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY
LIKE WHAT THEY DO--

32:35.800 --> 32:37.133
THEIR CHOICES
AND THEIR DECISIONS--

32:37.167 --> 32:38.833
BUT YOU STICK BY THEM.

32:38.867 --> 32:41.533
RIGHT NOW, ONE OF MY FRIENDS,

32:41.567 --> 32:44.333
HER BOYFRIEND IS DYING.
HEART FAILURE. HE'S 36.

32:44.367 --> 32:46.433
I CHECKED
KENDRA'S DRIVER'S LICENSE.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.500
SHE'S A DONOR.
SHE'S NOT A MATCH FOR HIM,

32:48.533 --> 32:50.433
BUT SHE COULD SAVE
A DOZEN OTHER LIVES.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.100
AND FROM WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT KENDRA, WHAT I'VE HEARD,

32:53.133 --> 32:55.267
I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT IF
SHE HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN

32:55.300 --> 32:58.300
WHERE SHE IS RIGHT NOW
AND SAVING A DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE,

32:58.333 --> 33:00.800
SHE'D SAVE THOSE PEOPLE.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.833
THAT WOULD BE HER DECISION.

33:02.867 --> 33:08.200
SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
YOU STICK BY HER ONE LAST TIME.

33:12.733 --> 33:15.167
EXCUSE ME.

33:19.267 --> 33:21.067
YOU PAGED?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.533
YEAH. THESE ARE, UM...

33:23.567 --> 33:26.067
THESE ARE X-RAYS OF A HUMAN
WITH AN OSTEOSARCOMA

33:26.067 --> 33:27.533
ON HIS TIBIA.

33:27.567 --> 33:29.733
IT'S THE CLOSEST I COULD GET
TO MIRRORING

33:29.767 --> 33:31.833
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
TO YOUR DOG.

33:31.867 --> 33:35.300
IN THIS PATIENT,
THE CANCER WAS AGGRESSIVE

33:35.333 --> 33:38.067
AND IT SPREAD QUICKLY,
AND HE DIED

33:38.100 --> 33:39.600
WHEN IT FINALLY METASTASIZED
ON HIS LUNGS.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.300
THE HUMAN DIED?

33:41.333 --> 33:43.067
YES, THE HUMAN DIED.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.133
THANK YOU, CALLIE.

33:48.167 --> 33:52.067
YOU'RE WELCOME, MEREDITH.

33:57.633 --> 34:00.700
HUH. YOU MADE UP WITH HIM.

34:00.733 --> 34:02.633
I TOLD HIM I'D GIVE HIM
ONE MORE CHANCE.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.300
AND I TOLD HER
SHE WON'T HAVE TO.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.467
WHAT I WENT THROUGH TODAY--
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH TODAY--

34:07.500 --> 34:09.167
IT'S CHANGED ME.
MM-HMM.

34:09.200 --> 34:11.067
THIS BULLET
WILL ALWAYS REMIND ME

34:11.067 --> 34:13.500
TO DO THE RIGHT THING
BY MY DEBORAH.

34:13.533 --> 34:14.833
HERE YOU GO.

34:14.867 --> 34:17.567
AND WHATEVER'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND,

34:17.600 --> 34:19.400
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST TRY
AND FORGIVE HIM.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.567
THAN ALL THAT ANGER.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.567
THANKS.

34:31.133 --> 34:33.300
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, WILL.

34:33.333 --> 34:37.633
WE'LL GET YOU THE O.R.
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

34:37.667 --> 34:39.500
MY FRIEND KENDRA...

34:39.533 --> 34:41.133
DR. GREY SAID

34:41.167 --> 34:44.700
THAT IF ANYBODY HAD
ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE ME,

34:44.733 --> 34:47.600
THAT THEY WOULD LET ME KNOW
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

34:47.633 --> 34:50.167
I'M SORRY.

35:04.833 --> 35:07.800
I'M--I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOME TIME OFF, MAN.

35:07.833 --> 35:10.267
I'M GONNA TALK TO THE OWNER,

35:10.300 --> 35:12.133
MAKE SURE THEY KEEP
YOUR JOB FOR YOU.

35:12.167 --> 35:14.433
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU GOT SHOT.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.200
NOT MY FAULT EITHER.

35:16.233 --> 35:18.433
YOU KNOW, I-I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER.

35:18.467 --> 35:21.267
PETEY HAD THE GUN.
I'M JUST SAYING...

35:21.300 --> 35:23.300
PEOPLE BLAME MANAGEMENT,
BUT...

35:23.333 --> 35:25.233
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN.

35:25.267 --> 35:28.667
I MEAN, I...
I DO THE BEST I CAN.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.500
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, RICHARD,

35:35.533 --> 35:37.600
BUT IF YOU KNEW THE DAY
THAT I HAD--

35:37.633 --> 35:39.533
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOSPITAL
HAS THOSE DAYS, ADDISON,

35:39.567 --> 35:42.700
AND NO ONE MAKES A SCENE
IN FRONT OF THEIR PEERS.

35:42.733 --> 35:44.333
GET IT TOGETHER.

35:46.067 --> 35:47.700
ADDISON...

35:47.733 --> 35:50.200
I CAN'T COMPETE.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.133
HE'S NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR,

35:52.167 --> 35:54.700
HE'S NOT TRYING TO HURT ME,
HE'S JUST...

35:54.733 --> 35:57.600
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
DEREK LOVES MEREDITH

35:57.633 --> 36:00.567
ARE DEREK AND MEREDITH.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.367
HOW DO I COMPETE WITH THAT?

36:05.233 --> 36:10.067
SO WHAT MAKES ANGER DIFFERENT
FROM THE SIX OTHER DEADLY SINS?

36:10.067 --> 36:13.200
***

36:21.300 --> 36:25.233
***

36:38.133 --> 36:39.767
(elevator bell dings)

36:39.800 --> 36:41.700
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE REALLY.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.800
YOU GIVE IN TO A SIN
LIKE ENVY OR PRIDE,

36:44.833 --> 36:49.167
AND YOU ONLY HURT YOURSELF.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.133
I LOVE YOU.

36:51.167 --> 36:54.267
***

36:54.300 --> 36:56.733
I'M SORRY. I'M...

36:56.767 --> 36:59.800
I-I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
I JUST--I...

36:59.833 --> 37:02.433
I-I HAVE VERBAL DIARRHEA,

37:02.467 --> 37:04.767
AND I'M A MORON.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.300
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

37:06.333 --> 37:08.067
ARE YOU--
ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

37:08.067 --> 37:09.733
GEORGE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

37:09.767 --> 37:12.500
I WOULDN'T ASK
IF IT WEREN'T IMPORTANT. IT'S--

37:12.533 --> 37:14.200
OKAY.

37:16.133 --> 37:19.267
I'LL CALL YOU... LATER?

37:19.300 --> 37:20.733
SURE.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.267
(bell on door rings)

37:23.300 --> 37:26.167
WERE WE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE DINNER TONIGHT?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.100
***

37:28.133 --> 37:30.067
TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT DOC.

37:30.067 --> 37:31.533
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

37:31.567 --> 37:34.600
YOU'VE BEEN DOWNPLAYING
HOW SICK HE IS, HAVEN'T YOU?

37:34.633 --> 37:35.733
(sighs)

37:35.767 --> 37:37.433
BEST CASE SCENARIO,

37:37.467 --> 37:40.100
I WOULD SAY DOC HAS
MAYBE A YEAR LEFT.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.333
OKAY.

37:41.367 --> 37:44.767
AND DOC IS NOT
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.167
OKAY.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.133
MEREDITH?

37:47.167 --> 37:49.667
DAMN IT.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.800
OH, I'M...

37:51.833 --> 37:53.733
I'M SORRY.

37:53.767 --> 37:56.633
I AM SO SORRY.
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM.

37:56.667 --> 37:58.367
I DO.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.700
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

38:00.733 --> 38:03.733
***

38:05.500 --> 38:07.400
YOU NEED MY HELP
FOR AN E.K.G.?

38:07.433 --> 38:09.633
NO. COME.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.100
OKAY, AFTER I DO THIS,

38:11.133 --> 38:13.167
I MIGHT HAVE TO SHOCK YOU
A FEW OF TIMES.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.133
DO WHAT?

38:15.167 --> 38:17.067
YOU FEELIN' GOOD?
I THINK SO.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.533
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME AGAIN.

38:19.567 --> 38:21.467
THE, UM, THE LVAD HAS BEEN
INSERTED INTO YOUR ABDOMEN

38:21.500 --> 38:22.600
AND IS CONNECTED
TO YOUR HEART.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.600
THIS CORD LEADS
TO THE POWER SOURCE.

38:24.633 --> 38:26.567
THIS ONE IS CONNECTED
TO THE PUMP

38:26.600 --> 38:28.367
THAT PUMPS YOUR HEART
FOR YOU.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.367
I HAVE THE CRASH CART,
THE DEFIBRILLATOR, THE AMBU BAG,

38:31.400 --> 38:33.067
SALINE--
DO WHAT, IZZIE?

38:33.100 --> 38:34.167
UM...

38:34.200 --> 38:36.667
I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD SAY STUFF.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.733
(Izzie) DENNY,
DO YOU WANT TO SAY STUFF?

38:38.767 --> 38:42.767
KISS ME... RIGHT HERE.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.800
***

38:47.567 --> 38:49.433
SEE?

38:49.467 --> 38:51.800
A KISS IS WORTH
A THOUSAND WORDS.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.300
A PICTURE. A PICTURE
IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.233
YOU'RE GONNA CORRECT ME
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

38:56.267 --> 38:58.333
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE INTRUSIVE--

38:58.367 --> 39:00.167
JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND, GEORGE!

39:00.200 --> 39:02.067
(Izzie) OKAY...

39:02.067 --> 39:03.433
YOU READY?

39:03.467 --> 39:05.567
AS I'LL EVER BE.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.533
***

39:08.567 --> 39:10.767
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

39:10.800 --> 39:12.500
TRY LUST OR COVETING,

39:12.533 --> 39:15.333
AND YOU'LL ONLY HURT YOURSELF

39:17.067 --> 39:19.233
BUT ANGER...

39:19.267 --> 39:21.167
ANGER IS THE WORST...

39:21.200 --> 39:23.133
(gunshots firing)

39:23.167 --> 39:24.800
(glass shatters)

39:24.833 --> 39:27.767
(gunshots continue)

39:27.800 --> 39:29.400
OKAY, WE'RE DONE.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.800
WHAT IS THAT?
ARE THOSE GUNSHOTS?

39:33.400 --> 39:36.300
THE MOTHER OF ALL SINS.
PETEY.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.067
DENNY, IF THERE REALLY IS SOME
KIND OF BIG, GLOWING LIGHT--

39:39.067 --> 39:42.067
I'M GONNA TRY LIKE HELL
TO STAY OUT OF IT.
EXACTLY.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.267
I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THIS.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.333
JUST MAKE SURE
NOBODY COMES THROUGH THAT DOOR.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:49.167 --> 39:53.100
***

39:53.133 --> 39:54.667
I'M STOPPING HIS HEART, GEORGE.

39:54.700 --> 39:57.567
NOT ONLY CAN ANGER
DRIVE YOU OVER THE EDGE,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.233
WHEN IT DOES,

39:59.267 --> 40:02.433
YOU CAN TAKE AN AWFUL LOT
OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH YOU.

40:02.467 --> 40:06.300
***

40:06.333 --> 40:08.400
IZZIE...

40:10.100 --> 40:13.033
(sirens wailing)

40:13.067 --> 40:15.133
OH, DR. BURKE!

40:15.167 --> 40:16.733
I NEED SOME HELP!

40:16.767 --> 40:20.500
***

40:21.667 --> 40:25.467
(Izzie) IT'S OKAY.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.467
BURKE WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.467
***

40:34.300 --> 40:37.300

continuous tone)
