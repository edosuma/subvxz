and I was dead from not eating?

02:54.950 --> 02:56.680
They'd cry their eyes out.

Hey! No tag-backs!

03:54.750 --> 03:55.950
Yeah, you cheater.

03:56.010 --> 03:56.910
You lie like a fly

03:56.980 --> 03:58.110

in its eye.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.410
The fly was funny,

03:59.490 --> 04:01.590
and the booger
was the icing on the cake.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.410
Friends, we love you all

04:03.490 --> 04:05.760
but I also have
a sinister motive

04:05.820 --> 04:07.720
for asking you all here--

04:07.790 --> 04:10.390
sinister being Latin
for left-handed.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.790
But enough joking.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.320
That was a joke?

04:28.110 --> 04:30.270
Well sir, like one out of
every nine Americans

04:30.350 --> 04:32.490
I'm left-handed,
and let me tell you

04:32.550 --> 04:34.460
it ain't all
peaches and cream.

to left-handed zithers.

"The Leftorium."

04:54.040 --> 04:55.740
So, Homer,
I'm dying to know

04:55.810 --> 04:57.280
what do you think
of The Leftorium?

04:57.340 --> 04:59.740
It sounds like
a pretty dumb idea to me.

04:59.810 --> 05:01.550
I know it's a little risky

05:01.610 --> 05:04.080
and it's going to be
a lot of hard work

05:04.150 --> 05:06.650
but, gosh darn it, it's going
to be a lot of fun too.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.990

Flanders?

No, it isn't.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.700
No! Don't say.

05:56.770 --> 05:58.610
Otherwise,
it won't come true.

05:58.670 --> 06:01.340
Ooh, that would be a shame.

you going to do?

Marge, TV gives so much
and asks so little.

are staring at the TV

instead of getting
some much-needed exercise.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.350
Those children's parents

the ancient art of karate.

have you sold anything?

08:30.620 --> 08:33.320
Not yet, but one
of the mall security guards

We learn karate
so we need never use it.

how <i>not to hit a guy.</i>

For now, let us read.

08:59.850 --> 09:01.160
Akira, my good man,

09:01.220 --> 09:02.590
when do we
break blocks of ice
with our heads?

09:02.650 --> 09:05.080
First you must fill your head
with wisdom.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.660
Then, you can hit ice with it.

09:06.730 --> 09:07.760
Yo, <i>sensei, can I go
to the bathroom?</i>

09:07.830 --> 09:10.030
You can
if you believe you can.

No, I do not know

Please tell me
because I'm dying to know.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.000

( <i>sobbing )</i>

18:41.130 --> 18:43.070
It's all my fault.

18:43.130 --> 18:44.230
No, it's not.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.040
Yes, it is.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.960
You tried to warn me

18:47.040 --> 18:49.440
about gambling
my family's future

18:49.510 --> 18:51.250
on some pig in a poke.

18:51.310 --> 18:52.550
I didn't listen.

18:52.610 --> 18:54.880
Homer, you were
a true friend.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.380
No, I was a swine.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.550
Listen, Flanders.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.350
Do you still have
that store?

19:00.420 --> 19:01.760
For two more days.

19:01.820 --> 19:05.060
Then it becomes
Libertarian Party headquarters.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.180
I hope they have better luck
than I did.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.400
Flanders, you open that store
tomorrow.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.130
Homer, there's no point.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.230
I said do it!

19:15.700 --> 19:17.740
Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.140
Remember last month
when I paid back that loan?

19:21.210 --> 19:24.080
Well, now I need <i>you
to do a favor for <i>me.</i></i>

19:24.140 --> 19:26.810
A left-handed corkscrew?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.050
Oh, baby.

19:28.110 --> 19:30.540
"Kiss me-- I'm left-handed?"

19:30.620 --> 19:31.820
( <i>laughs )</i>

19:31.880 --> 19:34.110
That's a classic.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.120
Whoa!

19:35.190 --> 19:36.320
Homer Simpson's on the phone.

19:36.390 --> 19:37.620
Tell him I went out.

19:37.690 --> 19:39.690
He needs you
to help Ned Flanders.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.130
Ned Flanders is in trouble?!

19:42.290 --> 19:44.320
Smithers, I'm licked.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.670
You open this can.

19:45.730 --> 19:47.800
Okay, but you softened
it up for me, sir.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.170
Hold it, Smithers.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.260
<i>I'll open the can.</i>

19:51.340 --> 19:52.040
But, sir, how?

19:52.100 --> 19:53.500
To the mall!

19:53.570 --> 19:54.810
I'll explain on the way.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.850
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.910
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.880
Homer:
Come on, ya' lefties.

20:06.950 --> 20:08.260
What did I tell you?

20:08.320 --> 20:09.990
Homer?

20:10.050 --> 20:13.350
It's all here,
and it's all backwards.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.650
That's right.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.400
( <i>excited voices buzzing )</i>

20:21.000 --> 20:25.210
The worm has turned, has it not,
my tin-plated friend?

20:25.270 --> 20:28.440
Look at you--
you who were once so proud.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.810
Feel the wrath
of the left hand of Burns.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.150
My life begins today.

20:35.210 --> 20:37.310
Wow! What an icebreaker.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.690
Left-handed ledgers.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.220
Now, I can write
all the way to the edge.

20:41.290 --> 20:44.190
Aha! Left-handed nunchukas.

20:44.260 --> 20:46.490
Wow!

20:46.560 --> 20:48.330
The boys
at the Diners Club

20:48.390 --> 20:50.520
will think I've
gone quite mad.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.070
Oh, I'll have
that roadster in the
corner as well.

20:53.130 --> 20:55.100
( <i>crowd gasps )</i>

20:55.170 --> 20:56.440
Yes, sir.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.470
Huzzah for the shopkeep.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.440
All:
Huzzah!

21:00.510 --> 21:04.110
Homer, affordable tract housing
made us neighbors

21:04.180 --> 21:06.010
but you made us friends.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.580
To Ned Flanders

21:07.650 --> 21:10.250
the richest left-handed man
in town.
