00:01.431 --> 00:03.366
Previously on Dance Moms...
HOLLY: That doesn't seem like

00:03.366 --> 00:05.001
mature choreography.
Don't care.

00:05.001 --> 00:07.337
Kira gave me an ultimatum.

00:07.337 --> 00:09.739
Kalani or Brynn.

00:09.739 --> 00:12.008
No, I'm not coming back
as long as she's there.

00:12.008 --> 00:13.543
My back hurts so bad.

00:14.511 --> 00:16.179
KIRA:
<i>So go (bleep) yourself!</i>

00:16.179 --> 00:17.814
You don't want to be here,
just go home.

00:17.814 --> 00:20.450
This is why she's a pathetic
piece of (bleep)!

00:20.450 --> 00:22.418
Are you yelling at Brynn?

00:22.418 --> 00:24.287
Go ask your kid
what I said!

00:25.288 --> 00:26.823
The problem does not lie
with Brynn.

00:26.823 --> 00:28.458
It lies with you.

00:28.458 --> 00:31.694
You're... on probation.

00:32.962 --> 00:34.664
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:34.664 --> 00:37.066
Kalani, what is the deal
with your mother?

00:37.066 --> 00:38.568
She doesn't want to be here.

00:38.568 --> 00:40.036
I don't think she has
any intent of coming back.

00:40.036 --> 00:41.871
Kalani shouldn't be here, then.

00:41.871 --> 00:42.906
Ashlee, help me out. Come on.
Ooh!

00:42.906 --> 00:44.774
ASHLEE:
<i>I feel like Abby asking me</i>

00:44.774 --> 00:46.609
<i>to help her in the office</i>
<i>is kind of win‐win for me.</i>

00:46.609 --> 00:49.012
Okay, so if I do a good job,
you don't have to pay me,

00:49.012 --> 00:50.280
<i>but can Brynn</i>
<i>do a solo next week?</i>

00:50.280 --> 00:51.614
(kissing)

00:51.614 --> 00:53.349
MELISSA: <i>Ashlee can do</i>
<i>whatever she wants.</i>

00:53.349 --> 00:54.818
I never kissed Abby's butt.
Abby was my friend.

00:54.818 --> 00:56.953
Your child's getting everything
handed to her.

00:56.953 --> 00:58.788
ASHLEE: <i>Abby is gonna see</i>
<i>Brynn and Maddie</i>

00:58.788 --> 01:00.824
<i>dance together, and that's</i>
<i>gonna be it for Kendall.</i>

01:00.824 --> 01:02.859
JILL:
<i>You don't have a team of two!</i>

01:02.859 --> 01:04.828
You're a bitch!
You're a (bleep) bitch!

figure it out?!

01:17.941 --> 01:19.142

01:19.142 --> 01:19.909
Get out!

01:19.909 --> 01:21.311
Listen, wait.

01:21.311 --> 01:23.713
You need to leave.
Please leave.

01:23.713 --> 01:24.881
I'm calling the police.

01:24.881 --> 01:27.350
I need the police.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.120
Why did that hang up?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.056
JILL: <i>I don't know</i>

01:33.056 --> 01:36.526

01:36.526 --> 01:38.795
Her behavior is
totally unpredictable.

01:38.795 --> 01:41.231
I am hysterical.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.966
We received an
e‐mail that...

01:42.966 --> 01:44.567
she's resigning.

01:44.567 --> 01:45.702
What?

01:45.702 --> 01:46.836
She's had it.

01:46.836 --> 01:47.871
I'm finished.

01:47.871 --> 01:49.072
This is a huge studio

<i>to run,</i>
<i>and that's a lot of stress</i>

01:51.474 --> 01:53.142

01:53.142 --> 01:54.677
<i>I just feel bad</i>

01:54.677 --> 01:56.312
for her poor employee

01:56.312 --> 01:58.114
<i>who got caught</i>
<i>right in the crossfire.</i>

01:58.114 --> 01:59.782
I just had to get rid of my girl

01:59.782 --> 02:01.484
that works here.
JILL: Abby, you're not

02:01.484 --> 02:03.319
the easiest person
to‐to deal with.

02:03.319 --> 02:05.455
JESSALYNN:
Do you have a replacement?

02:07.857 --> 02:09.592
No, she just walked out.

02:09.592 --> 02:12.462
You just need to find somebody
and live and learn and move on.

02:12.462 --> 02:13.963
Gonna get this show on the road?

02:13.963 --> 02:15.832
Yeah.
Yeah, we're here.
Yes, let's do it.

02:15.832 --> 02:16.833
Girls! Come on, let's go!

02:16.833 --> 02:19.269
We're ready for pyramid!

02:21.771 --> 02:23.806
All right, so...

02:23.806 --> 02:25.942
we need to get
through the pyramid

02:25.942 --> 02:27.543
and start the
choreography.

02:27.543 --> 02:29.612
On the bottom, we have...

02:29.612 --> 02:30.713
Brynn.

02:30.713 --> 02:31.981
ASHLEE:
Why?

02:31.981 --> 02:35.518
Because Brynn does well
in a group dance,

02:35.518 --> 02:38.087
<i>but you don't</i>
<i>stand out in the group.</i>

02:38.087 --> 02:40.056
<i>You don't draw me in.</i>

02:41.391 --> 02:42.759
You said we were
still on probation.

02:42.759 --> 02:44.861
You said Brynn's great,
you said I suck.

02:46.129 --> 02:47.230
You basically said

02:47.230 --> 02:49.198
I need to kiss your butt
like Melissa does.

02:49.198 --> 02:50.633
Melissa never butted in.

02:50.633 --> 02:51.935
She never interrupted.

02:51.935 --> 02:53.069
JESSALYNN:
Melissa also

02:53.069 --> 02:54.504
sucks up to you.

02:54.504 --> 02:57.440
I think maybe you're
the replacement.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.475
Maybe you could help me
out and answer the phone

02:59.475 --> 03:01.144
a little bit.
ASHLEE: If you want me to.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.546
MELISSA:
<i>Now Ashlee wants</i>

03:03.546 --> 03:05.315
to work for her.
It's 'cause she doesn't

03:05.315 --> 03:07.183
have any friends
to go out and play.

03:07.183 --> 03:09.185
<i>But she's trying</i>
<i>to kiss Abby's butt.</i>

03:09.185 --> 03:10.820
<i>You know what,</i>
<i>she can do whatever she wants.</i>

03:10.820 --> 03:13.256
I never kissed Abby's butt.
Abby was my friend.

03:13.256 --> 03:15.191
I'm getting
so much slack from everybody

03:15.191 --> 03:16.893
that, you know,
I always kiss your butt

03:16.893 --> 03:18.828
and everything and...
They need to get over it.

03:18.828 --> 03:19.996
They've been jealous
since Maddie

03:19.996 --> 03:21.431
from day one,
and they still are.

03:21.431 --> 03:23.333
MELISSA: You know I love you.
I know.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.234
And when those women
say bad things about you,

03:25.234 --> 03:28.137
it hurts my heart and it hurts
Maddie's heart, too.

03:28.137 --> 03:31.207
ABBY LEE:
Next on the pyramid...

03:35.878 --> 03:38.314
... we have Maddie.
MOMS: What?!

03:38.314 --> 03:39.449
ABBY LEE:
Maddie...

03:39.449 --> 03:41.217
it was fine.

03:41.217 --> 03:42.485
You were in the group dance.

03:42.485 --> 03:44.053
We're thrilled to have you back.

03:46.189 --> 03:47.857
All right, next...

03:50.193 --> 03:51.728
...Kendall.

03:54.731 --> 03:55.631
And next...

03:58.001 --> 03:59.168
... Kalani.

03:59.168 --> 04:02.472
Moving up...

04:04.974 --> 04:06.109
... we have Nia.

04:07.677 --> 04:09.212
And...

04:09.212 --> 04:10.580
JoJo.

04:12.015 --> 04:13.983
I guess it's no
surprise now.

04:13.983 --> 04:18.254
On top of the pyramid was
our highest‐scoring soloist...

04:18.254 --> 04:20.189
Mackenzie.
(cheering)

04:20.189 --> 04:22.225
<i>She nailed it. So...</i>

04:22.225 --> 04:24.794
competition this week.
We're local.

04:24.794 --> 04:27.663
We're going to Fierce
Dance Competition

04:27.663 --> 04:29.065
at Panorama City High School.

04:29.065 --> 04:30.833
This week,

04:30.833 --> 04:32.502
the group routine

04:32.502 --> 04:33.703
will pay homage

04:33.703 --> 04:36.205
to none other
than Mr. Bob Fosse.

04:36.205 --> 04:37.407
Oh, yay!
(girls cheering)

04:37.407 --> 04:39.342
HOLLY:
I like that.

04:39.342 --> 04:40.710
That's fun.
That's good stuff.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.145
JILL: I love Fosse.
Yeah.

04:42.145 --> 04:43.579
I love that.

04:43.579 --> 04:47.016
Our routine will be entitled
"Bittersweet Charity."

04:47.016 --> 04:48.518
(chuckles)

04:49.986 --> 04:51.220
You're dance hall girls.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.157
Obviously, you will
be wearing heels.

04:54.157 --> 04:55.625
(girls cheering)

04:55.625 --> 04:57.060
MELISSA:
<i>Our girls just started</i>

04:57.060 --> 04:59.328
dancing in heels
in class this year,

04:59.328 --> 05:01.397
but they've never
competed in heels.

05:01.397 --> 05:04.067
<i>None of them, except Kalani.</i>

05:04.067 --> 05:07.103
So it's gonna be a challenge,
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

05:07.103 --> 05:09.405
We have two duets.

05:09.405 --> 05:11.507
(girls cheering)

05:11.507 --> 05:12.708
Oh!

05:14.143 --> 05:16.079
My first duet is going...

05:18.948 --> 05:21.317
...to Kendall and Kalani.

05:21.317 --> 05:22.585
(girls cheering)

05:22.585 --> 05:23.586
Hey!

05:23.586 --> 05:25.855
You are doing a jazz duet.

05:25.855 --> 05:28.524
The name of the duet

05:28.524 --> 05:30.693
is "Grifters."

05:30.693 --> 05:32.428
And...

05:32.428 --> 05:35.364
a grifter is a con artist.

05:35.364 --> 05:37.767
KALANI:
<i>I'm super excited</i>

05:37.767 --> 05:40.303
I have a group dance
and a duet this week,

05:40.303 --> 05:42.205
but my back
has been really hurting,

05:42.205 --> 05:44.373
so I have to make sure
that I'm extra careful.

05:45.675 --> 05:47.577
Kalani, what...

05:47.577 --> 05:49.912
is the deal with
your mother?

05:52.815 --> 05:54.217
That's not okay.

05:54.217 --> 05:57.120
JESSALYNN: <i>Abby has these little</i>
<i>underlying digs, so...</i>

05:57.120 --> 05:59.222
maybe this whole
grifter thing is meant

05:59.222 --> 06:00.423
<i>for Kira.</i>

06:00.423 --> 06:01.824
<i>But then again,</i>

06:01.824 --> 06:04.460
Kira probably doesn't even know
what a grifter is.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.629
My second duet...

06:09.465 --> 06:11.200
...is going to...

06:13.469 --> 06:15.538
...Maddie and Brynn.

06:15.538 --> 06:18.207
(girls cheering)

06:18.207 --> 06:19.609
Okay, so...

06:20.776 --> 06:21.811
Mm‐hmm.

06:21.811 --> 06:24.413
ABBY LEE: Your lyrical
duet is entitled

06:24.413 --> 06:27.083
"Together as One."

06:29.218 --> 06:30.386
JILL:
<i>Maddie and Kendall</i>

06:30.386 --> 06:32.755
have been duet partners
for years.

06:32.755 --> 06:34.190
<i>Kendall and Kalani</i>

06:34.190 --> 06:36.192
get a duet this week.

06:36.192 --> 06:37.660
<i>Very excited for it.</i>

06:37.660 --> 06:40.096
<i>I just wish Kendall</i>
<i>could be with Maddie.</i>

06:40.096 --> 06:42.532
Okay, so, two of my

06:42.532 --> 06:46.068
strongest dancers
are going up against

06:46.068 --> 06:48.371
my number‐one girl
and the new girl.

06:48.371 --> 06:51.374
The new girl,
who your mother's

06:51.374 --> 06:54.110
giving me ultimatums:
"I'm not coming back

06:54.110 --> 06:56.179
<i>unless that woman's gone."</i>

06:56.179 --> 06:58.381
Your mother constantly...

07:02.652 --> 07:05.421
Nothing makes a dancer
work harder

07:05.421 --> 07:07.690
than putting another dancer
who's better

07:07.690 --> 07:09.192
right in front of them.

07:09.192 --> 07:10.927
<i>If Kalani and Kendall</i>

07:10.927 --> 07:13.829
<i>really want to beat</i>
<i>Maddie and Brynn,</i>

07:13.829 --> 07:16.332
then they need to step out
onstage in perfect unison.

07:16.332 --> 07:17.600
♪ ♪

07:17.600 --> 07:20.002
So this is
one, two, three, four,

07:20.002 --> 07:23.105
five, six, drop seven.

07:23.105 --> 07:24.807
ASHLEE:
<i>Okay, so I thought</i>

07:24.807 --> 07:27.443
the‐the title "Grifter,"

07:27.443 --> 07:29.645
I thought for sure
Abby was gonna relate it

07:29.645 --> 07:31.180
back to Kira.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.115
JESSALYNN: I can't believe
Kalani said that about her mom.

07:33.115 --> 07:34.617
She didn't cover for her at all.

07:34.617 --> 07:36.352
Nope.
MELISSA:
Doesn't want to be here.

07:36.352 --> 07:38.154
She's like, "The truth is she
doesn't even want to be here."

07:38.154 --> 07:39.555
Yeah, but you know what?
Kalani did

07:39.555 --> 07:40.856
<i>the right thing.</i>
JESSALYNN: <i>Yeah, but she</i>

07:40.856 --> 07:43.192
<i>could've just said,</i>
<i>"She just had a baby."</i>

07:43.192 --> 07:45.094
She is kind of pulling one
over on you,

07:45.094 --> 07:46.462
like, "Take my kid
for a little bit,"

07:46.462 --> 07:48.331
or, "Oh, a few more weeks."

07:48.331 --> 07:50.266
I don't think she has
any intent of coming back.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.368
It's always
gonna be something.

07:52.368 --> 07:54.537
But, if that's the case,
like, I mean,

07:54.537 --> 07:55.905
Kalani shouldn't be here, then.

07:55.905 --> 07:58.274
JESSALYNN:
<i>I feel bad for Kalani.</i>

07:58.274 --> 08:01.477
<i>Like, her mom's not here,</i>
<i>she's living with Melissa.</i>

08:01.477 --> 08:03.045
<i>Kalani needs a mom.</i>

08:03.045 --> 08:05.181
Kira needs to figure out
how she can get back here

08:05.181 --> 08:09.051
and take care of Kalani and
be an active member of the team.

08:09.051 --> 08:10.219
ABBY LEE:
<i>Maddie,</i>

08:10.219 --> 08:11.554
you are the team.

08:11.554 --> 08:13.356
You represent
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

08:13.356 --> 08:15.658
Everybody knows her name.

08:16.792 --> 08:18.294
And you have two other
people over there

08:18.294 --> 08:19.462
who are your friends,

08:19.462 --> 08:20.963
but they want to win.

08:20.963 --> 08:23.499
They have something to prove.
You have something to prove.

08:23.499 --> 08:26.035
So, will "Together as One"‐‐

08:26.035 --> 08:29.138
the wholesome, the sweet,

08:29.138 --> 08:31.207
the kind‐‐
come out on top?

08:31.207 --> 08:33.509
Or will it be "The Grifters"‐‐

08:33.509 --> 08:35.945
sneaky, underhanded?

08:35.945 --> 08:37.213
KENDALL:
We're gonna defeat

08:37.213 --> 08:38.881
the first place win.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.049

17:07.823 --> 17:09.324
"Normally I can push through
the pain and I deal with it,

17:09.324 --> 17:11.360
but this has been hard."
JILL: Well, I...
Maybe she shouldn't

17:11.360 --> 17:12.728
dance this weekend.
I think she shouldn't.

17:12.728 --> 17:14.163
It's awkward
for me because,

17:14.163 --> 17:16.598
as a mom, I feel one way,

17:16.598 --> 17:18.100
and she's not my child.
Plus, I don't want

17:18.100 --> 17:20.469
to be disrespectful to Kira,
because I don't know what Kira

17:20.469 --> 17:21.737
has said to her.
Yeah.

17:21.737 --> 17:23.505
It would be great
if Kira was here to be able

17:23.505 --> 17:24.973
to say, "Kalani, you're
not dancing." I don't know

17:24.973 --> 17:26.875
if Kira would do that or not.
You're the guardian here.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.911
You could say, "You know what,
Kira, I'm here, you're not.

17:28.911 --> 17:31.280
"If it's up to me,
I'm making that call.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.948
"If you want
to override my decision,

17:32.948 --> 17:34.316
you need to get here."

17:34.316 --> 17:36.718
JILL: It's very selfish for
her mother not to be here.

17:37.853 --> 17:40.055
ABBY LEE:
<i>Ashlee!</i>

17:40.055 --> 17:42.090
<i>You're late!</i>
ASHLEE: <i>Sorry! Sorry.</i>

17:42.090 --> 17:44.426
I don't have my makeup on.
I don't have my hair done.
Well...

17:44.426 --> 17:46.728
But you have your makeup
and hair done. I work first.

17:46.728 --> 17:48.397
I put myself secondary

17:48.397 --> 17:50.532
to my students and my business.

17:50.532 --> 17:52.634
I always have.

17:52.634 --> 17:55.304
I have some kind of virus.
I never had acne.

17:55.304 --> 17:57.072
I never had pimples as a kid.

17:57.072 --> 17:58.173
Can it be stress?

17:58.173 --> 17:59.274
No.

17:59.274 --> 18:01.176
Believe me,
I'm under stress a lot.

18:01.176 --> 18:03.612
I yell, I get it out, it's over.

18:03.612 --> 18:04.947
ASHLEE:
<i>I feel like Abby asking me</i>

18:04.947 --> 18:07.216
to help her in the office
is kind of win‐win for me,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.117
because, number one,
I don't have to sit out

18:09.117 --> 18:10.519
and listen to those women bitch.

18:10.519 --> 18:12.855
And number two,
Abby likes me more.

18:12.855 --> 18:14.556
I'm helping.
I'm doing a good job.

18:14.556 --> 18:18.093
I'm really trying to do kind
of what you've asked me to do.

18:18.093 --> 18:21.096
And now that I've been back,
like, helping and doing stuff

18:21.096 --> 18:22.998
for you, now with those
moms, it's even worse.

18:22.998 --> 18:24.499
And so what do I do?
Oh, well...

18:24.499 --> 18:26.401
Half of the arguments start
with, "Well, you're not even

18:26.401 --> 18:29.238
really on the team." I mean,
what is she gonna have to do?

18:29.238 --> 18:32.040
The problem is, with your life,
it might need you.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.509
Mm‐hmm. And I can only
say in this moment...

18:34.509 --> 18:36.178
And before,
you chose that life

18:36.178 --> 18:38.580
over Brynn and Brynn being
in the dance company.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.550
I think you were here before,
and you... and you left.

18:41.550 --> 18:44.386
My life is totally different,
and I'm ready to focus on her.

18:44.386 --> 18:45.754
She wants to be here.

18:45.754 --> 18:49.591
She's gonna work her butt off
to be your star dancer.

18:49.591 --> 18:51.660
I just don't want to put Brynn
on the team

18:51.660 --> 18:54.963
and then be made a fool of
if something goes awry

18:54.963 --> 18:56.531
in‐in your home life.
And then,

18:56.531 --> 18:58.834
wait a minute, I‐I look like
the idiot because I gave you

18:58.834 --> 18:59.902
a second chance.
I agree.

18:59.902 --> 19:01.904
Uh, does that make sense?

19:06.275 --> 19:08.777

KIRA: Hello?

19:16.218 --> 19:19.187
Hi. Kalani is dancing, but...

19:19.187 --> 19:20.756
I‐I really don't think

19:20.756 --> 19:21.790
it's a great idea.

19:31.767 --> 19:33.769
You need to make the call,

19:38.407 --> 19:39.775
HOLLY:
<i>This is exactly why</i>

19:39.775 --> 19:41.510
Kira needs to be here.

19:41.510 --> 19:42.678
<i>She needs to put her foot down.</i>

19:44.313 --> 19:45.280

19:49.418 --> 19:52.020
I just don't want to let, like,
Kendall down and the group down.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.055
MELISSA:
You're not.

19:55.857 --> 19:57.893

No.

Kalani can't

20:07.803 --> 20:09.104
<i>and shouldn't dance.</i>

20:09.104 --> 20:11.139
KENDALL: Kalani, please don't
stress about this duet.

20:11.139 --> 20:13.175

No, I just feel bad.

I'm the first dance teacher

25:46.975 --> 25:49.678
JILL:
<i>She's out doing Abby's hair,</i>

25:49.678 --> 25:51.846
and the kid gets
all the good choreography

25:51.846 --> 25:54.215
and gets everything handed
to her, and I'm sure she'll get

25:54.215 --> 25:55.684
a solo next week and...

25:55.684 --> 25:57.652
Not if Maddie
makes her look bad.

25:57.652 --> 25:59.187
JILL:
<i>Brynn's on probation,</i>

25:59.187 --> 26:01.690
<i>so I think, this week,</i>
<i>Ashlee thinks</i>

26:01.690 --> 26:05.393
this is her way
of getting her kid on the team.

26:07.362 --> 26:09.197
JILL:
Nia, thanks for stepping in.

26:09.197 --> 26:10.365
This is your kind of dance.

26:10.365 --> 26:12.434
You know that.
And you...

26:12.434 --> 26:14.235
More time. But, you know...
We needed more time.

26:14.235 --> 26:16.338
Well, yeah,
but that's always the case.

26:16.338 --> 26:17.939
HOLLY:
Yeah.

26:17.939 --> 26:21.509
<i>I'm not stupid. I know my kid's</i>
<i>the underdog this week.</i>

26:21.509 --> 26:24.079
But the more opportunities
that Nia has onstage the better.

26:24.079 --> 26:25.680
<i>Everything's</i>
<i>a learning experience.</i>

26:25.680 --> 26:28.717
You didn't touch Abby's face,
did you?

26:28.717 --> 26:30.318
JILL:
Did you do her hair?

26:30.318 --> 26:32.821
I did do her hair.
It looks a lot better.

26:32.821 --> 26:36.091
But she has high
hopes for our duet.

26:36.091 --> 26:37.292
She's like,

26:37.292 --> 26:38.760
"I wish that kids
from our studio

26:38.760 --> 26:40.495
"were gonna come watch
these two dance together,

26:40.495 --> 26:42.897
'cause it's gonna be
so beautiful."

26:42.897 --> 26:45.333
Yeah, and it's a really
level playing field.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.402
JILL: I know. But you know
the problem with that?

26:47.402 --> 26:48.570
Is she enjoys saying that.

26:48.570 --> 26:51.506
That's so rude,
because the day will come

26:51.506 --> 26:53.608
where your child
isn't sitting on top...

26:53.608 --> 26:55.009
HOLLY:
That's just wrong.

26:55.009 --> 26:56.778
JILL: ... and you won't
want to do her hair,

26:56.778 --> 26:59.180
and you'll be
just like the rest of us.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.648
Your day will come.

27:00.648 --> 27:03.585
It'll be really
fun when it does.

27:03.585 --> 27:04.819
Well, we'll see.

27:04.819 --> 27:06.221
Melissa's day
still hasn't

27:06.221 --> 27:08.223
really even come.
JESSALYNN: Oh...

27:08.223 --> 27:10.291
JILL: You're not Melissa.
You never will be.
I'm not...

27:10.291 --> 27:11.659
ASHLEE: I don't want
to be Melissa.

27:11.659 --> 27:14.062
JILL: Well, then why would you
compare yourself to Melissa?

27:14.062 --> 27:15.597
I'm Abby's friend.

27:15.597 --> 27:17.432
Abby said if you want to be...

27:17.432 --> 27:19.167
We heard you say it five times!
You're just
a surrogate fill‐in.

27:19.167 --> 27:21.770
When my kid stops
being discounted by
everybody else here,

27:21.770 --> 27:23.872
then maybe I'll be a
little bit less arrogant.

27:23.872 --> 27:26.040
We don't discount her.
Talk to the queen.
I told her great job yesterday.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.109
Would you listen for a second?!
JILL: No!

27:28.109 --> 27:29.511
I'm tired
of listening to you!

27:29.511 --> 27:30.912
Stop it!

27:30.912 --> 27:32.647
It's not
about your child!

27:32.647 --> 27:34.649
(bleep) you, Jill!
I'm not talking about that!

27:34.649 --> 27:35.850
Would you listen?!

27:35.850 --> 27:38.319
You just said,
"Brynn, blah, blah, blah."

27:38.319 --> 27:40.955
Let me finish my damn sentence!

27:40.955 --> 27:42.957
Okay, but how does this
affect you and Brynn?

27:42.957 --> 27:44.292
It doesn't, Jill, okay?!
Okay, then why

27:44.292 --> 27:46.127
did you have to bring
your child into it?

27:46.127 --> 27:47.629
No, it doesn't affect me!
You're a bitch!

27:47.629 --> 27:48.897
You're a (bleep) bitch!
Okay. Oh! Oh!

27:48.897 --> 27:49.864
Just shut up!

27:49.864 --> 27:52.066
Oh, she's so classy lady!

27:52.066 --> 27:53.067
Nice!

27:54.669 --> 27:57.672
I clearly do not have
any allies on this team.

27:57.672 --> 28:00.442
I mean, even Holly, she's
kind of nice to me sometimes,

28:00.442 --> 28:02.177
<i>but when it comes down to it,</i>

28:02.177 --> 28:04.179
<i>she's not really happy</i>
<i>that Brynn is getting</i>

28:04.179 --> 28:06.381
<i>all these things</i>
<i>that Nia has never gotten.</i>

28:06.381 --> 28:08.983
Abby's the only one,
I feel like, at this point,

28:08.983 --> 28:11.252
that's even somewhat
of an ally of mine.

28:11.252 --> 28:12.587
ABBY LEE:
You're crying.
Yes.

28:12.587 --> 28:14.022
Why are you crying?

28:14.022 --> 28:15.356
(phone beeps)

28:15.356 --> 28:17.192
'Cause I'm tired
of being screamed at.
Huh?

28:17.192 --> 28:18.693
Save those tears
for your pillow.

28:18.693 --> 28:21.763
Just the constant picking, and
I'm not allowed to say anything.

28:21.763 --> 28:23.231
Well, I don't blame you.
Don't cry.

28:23.231 --> 28:25.400
You're a pretty girl.
You don't need to be crying.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.968

GIANNA:
Even if, like, if Nia

33:41.749 --> 33:43.584

then Kendall would

33:43.584 --> 33:45.019
look over and think
she was wrong,

33:45.019 --> 33:46.521
rather than Nia
being wrong,

No.

34:40.741 --> 34:43.077
that Nia was gonna
step into Kalani's part

34:43.077 --> 34:45.479
<i>and do the duet, but now,</i>

34:45.479 --> 34:47.815
after she saw Brynn onstage
with Maddie

34:47.815 --> 34:50.518
and saw how good
they look together,

34:50.518 --> 34:52.220
now it's a different story.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.754
There's no competition.

34:53.754 --> 34:56.023
Take Maddie,
who's doing the exact

34:56.023 --> 34:58.492
same thing
since she was three years old.

34:58.492 --> 35:00.895
When you want her to win,
you give her

35:00.895 --> 35:02.697
what she's been doing
since she was three.

35:02.697 --> 35:04.966
Maddie does tap.
She won tap, jazz...
ABBY: Thank me! I'm smart!

35:04.966 --> 35:06.300
ABBY: I've got it
figured out!
Right.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.536
But it does
my child no good.

35:08.536 --> 35:10.471
You don't have
a team of two.

35:10.471 --> 35:12.273
Although you would like to,

35:12.273 --> 35:13.875
you don't.
You have a team

35:13.875 --> 35:15.109
of seven kids.

35:15.109 --> 35:16.310
Give seven kids

35:16.310 --> 35:17.912
equal opportunity.
But...

35:17.912 --> 35:22.083
Give them every chance to go out
and feel good about themselves.

35:22.083 --> 35:25.019
What? I wasn't put on this Earth
to make your kid feel good.

35:25.019 --> 35:27.288
Okay, okay.
I was put on this Earth
to teach her how to dance.

35:27.288 --> 35:28.122
Period.

35:29.957 --> 35:31.525
ABBY LEE:

Melissa, you have a hard time
when it's not about your kids.

35:39.700 --> 35:40.968

<i>for the first time,</i>

35:54.181 --> 35:56.317
that they can handle
mature choreography

35:56.317 --> 35:59.720
<i>without Kalani</i>
<i>and do well with it.</i>

35:59.720 --> 36:03.557
Girls, this is a Broadway
number that I would love to do.

36:03.557 --> 36:07.361
I hope and pray that you all
get that experience someday,

36:07.361 --> 36:10.431
to step on a Broadway
stage and say,

36:10.431 --> 36:11.432
"I did it."

36:11.432 --> 36:12.900
All right,

36:22.777 --> 36:24.178
I'm really nervous
for the group dance

40:47.541 --> 40:49.476
Maddie, you need to
have a solo next week.

40:49.476 --> 40:52.313
You need to be
polished and wonderful

40:52.313 --> 40:55.316
and just as amazing as you were
in the duet in your own solo.

40:55.316 --> 40:57.151
Okay?
Thank you.

<i>that I did this week,</i>
<i>so one way she can repay me</i>

41:02.990 --> 41:04.592
is giving Brynn solos.

41:04.592 --> 41:07.828
It sounds like you for sure
decided a solo for Maddie,

41:07.828 --> 41:09.930
but you're still iffy
on the other ones?

41:09.930 --> 41:12.366
Haven't even
thought about it.

41:12.366 --> 41:14.301
I'm obviously hoping
for Brynn to have one.

41:14.301 --> 41:16.070
You have to
understand, how many

41:16.070 --> 41:18.706
more hours in class has she been
working her butt off?

41:18.706 --> 41:21.575
MELISSA: Our kids work
just as hard as your daughter.

41:21.575 --> 41:23.110
I didn't mention
anybody else's child

41:23.110 --> 41:25.045
in that sentence.
I know, but when you say...

41:25.045 --> 41:27.548
If I say, "Oh, my God,
my daughter just works so hard,

41:27.548 --> 41:28.816
Abby, oh, my God," that means

41:28.816 --> 41:30.484
none... no other kids
work hard.

41:30.484 --> 41:31.919
No, it doesn't mean that.

41:31.919 --> 41:33.387
Well, to me, it does.

41:33.387 --> 41:36.257
When you get it thrown in your
face every day. You know what?

41:36.257 --> 41:38.325
JILL: That's exactly
what she means by that.

41:38.325 --> 41:41.328
We've heard it...
a hundred times.

41:41.328 --> 41:42.696
ASHLEE:
I just think, Melissa,

41:42.696 --> 41:44.632
you have a hard time
when it's not about your kids.

41:47.568 --> 41:48.802
This show is good

41:48.802 --> 41:50.037

41:50.037 --> 41:51.205
Okay? So, just saying.

41:52.973 --> 41:55.075
I'm done.

ABBY LEE:

42:02.082 --> 42:04.618
Brynn, Maddie, Kendall.

42:04.618 --> 42:07.154
JILL:
You sabotaged six other kids

42:07.154 --> 42:09.423
to make sure
yours got what she needed.

42:09.423 --> 42:11.058
ASHLEE:
You are pure evil.

42:11.058 --> 42:12.760
You guys can all go to hell.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.695
(screaming)

42:14.695 --> 42:16.830
JILL:
So, Abby is not coming down.

42:16.830 --> 42:18.832
ABBY LEE: Today these moms
made a decision.

42:18.832 --> 42:21.235
And their decision
was detrimental.
