00:31.440 --> 00:36.018
(man) ♫ I love your funny face

00:36.153 --> 00:40.020
♫ Your sunny, funny face

00:40.823 --> 00:43.030
♫ For you're a cutie

00:43.159 --> 00:45.235
♫ With more than beauty

00:45.578 --> 00:48.033
♫ You've got a lot of

00:48.163 --> 00:50.120
♫ Personality-N-T

00:50.248 --> 00:54.542
♫ You fill the air with smiles

00:55.086 --> 00:59.748
♫ For miles and miles and miles

00:59.882 --> 01:02.171
♫ Though you're no Mona Lisa

01:02.301 --> 01:04.922
♫ For worlds I'd not replace

01:05.053 --> 01:08.754
♫ Your sunny, funny face

01:10.683 --> 01:18.773
(women)
♫ You've made my life so glamorous

01:19.233 --> 01:26.231
♫ You can't blame me
for feeling amorous

01:26.364 --> 01:31.109
♫ Oh, s'wonderful

01:31.619 --> 01:36.530
♫ S'marvelous

01:55.433 --> 01:56.761
(military drum beat)

02:04.316 --> 02:06.355
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.937
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.988
(Miss Prescott) Now hear this!

02:39.138 --> 02:42.554
I simpIy cannot release this issue
the way it is!

02:42.683 --> 02:47.345
In the 60 years of Quality
magazine, this hits rock bottom.

02:47.479 --> 02:51.263
If I let this go through, I will have
failed the American woman.

02:51.399 --> 02:53.308
(all) No, Miss Prescott,
don't say that!

02:53.443 --> 02:56.562
The great American woman,
who stands out there naked,

02:56.696 --> 02:59.815
waiting for me
to tell her what to wear.

02:59.949 --> 03:02.071
It doesn't speak.

03:02.201 --> 03:05.700
And if it won't speak to me,
it won't speak to anyone.

03:06.788 --> 03:10.038
A magazine
must be like a human being.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.871
If it comes into the home
it must contribute.

03:13.002 --> 03:16.121
It just can't lie around.

03:16.255 --> 03:18.461
A magazine must have...

03:19.549 --> 03:22.384
..blood and brains and pizzazz.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.004
This is just paper!

03:24.137 --> 03:27.552
If I send paper to the American
woman, I will have let her down.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.923
(all) No, Miss Prescott,
you mustn't say that.

03:30.059 --> 03:32.098
Yes. D for down.

03:32.227 --> 03:33.721
D for dreary.

03:33.854 --> 03:38.232
D for dull and for depressing,

03:38.359 --> 03:40.185
dismal and deadly!

03:43.697 --> 03:46.448
Ahh! Here it is!

03:46.575 --> 03:49.575
Here is our theme.
Here is our answer. Pink!

03:49.702 --> 03:51.529
(excited chatter)

03:56.208 --> 03:59.826
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Listen, take this to all the designers.

03:59.961 --> 04:02.250
I want dresses made up in
exactly this shade of pink.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.254
Babs, take this to Kaiser Delmont.

04:04.382 --> 04:06.707
I want shoes and stockings
in exactly this colour.

04:06.843 --> 04:09.416
Laura, everything goes pink!

04:09.553 --> 04:12.720
I want the whole issue pink.
I want the whole country pink!

04:12.848 --> 04:17.059
Lettie, take an editorial.
"To the women of America..."

04:17.185 --> 04:19.853
No, make it
"To the women everywhere."

04:20.188 --> 04:21.765
Banish the black,

04:21.898 --> 04:23.440
burn the blue,

04:23.566 --> 04:25.642
and bury the beige.

04:25.776 --> 04:27.650
From now on, girls...

04:29.571 --> 04:33.189
♫ Think pink! Think pink
when you shop for summer clothes

04:33.325 --> 04:37.369
♫ Think pink! Think pink
if you want that quelque chose

04:37.495 --> 04:39.286
♫ Red is dead, blue is through

04:39.413 --> 04:41.205
♫ Green's obscene, brown's taboo

04:41.332 --> 04:45.246
♫ And there is not the slightest
excuse for plum or puce

04:45.377 --> 04:46.919
♫ Or chartreuse

04:47.045 --> 04:50.710
♫ Think pink!
Forget that Dior says black and rust

04:50.840 --> 04:54.540
♫ Think pink! Who cares
if the new look has no bust?

04:54.677 --> 04:56.669
♫ Now, I wouldn't presume to tell a woman

04:56.804 --> 04:58.262
♫ What a woman ought to think

04:58.389 --> 05:00.879
♫ But tell her if she's gotta think,
think pink

05:01.016 --> 05:03.589
(women) ♫ For bags, pink for shoes

05:03.727 --> 05:06.264
♫ Razzle, dazzle and spread the news

05:06.729 --> 05:10.063
♫ And pink's for the lady
with joie de vivre

05:11.734 --> 05:14.485
♫ Pink's for all the family

05:14.945 --> 05:17.815
♫ Try pink shampoo

05:18.198 --> 05:20.274
♫ Pink toothpaste too!

05:20.909 --> 05:23.316
♫ Play in pink, all day in pink

05:23.453 --> 05:26.240
♫ Pretty gayin' pink

05:29.041 --> 05:29.990
♫ Drive in pink

05:30.125 --> 05:31.156
♫ Come alive in pink

05:31.293 --> 05:34.128
♫ Have a dive in pink

05:36.881 --> 05:41.425
♫ Go out dancing
but just remember one thing

05:41.553 --> 05:43.296
♫ You can get a little wink

05:43.430 --> 05:45.138
♫ If you got a little pink

05:45.265 --> 05:48.965
♫ In your swing

05:51.812 --> 05:56.937
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
it's the latest word, you know

05:58.151 --> 06:02.979
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
and you're Michelangelo

06:04.615 --> 06:07.450
♫ Feels so gay, feels so bright

06:07.576 --> 06:10.945
♫ Makes your day, makes your night

06:11.079 --> 06:14.946
♫ Pink is now the colour to which
you gotta switch

06:15.083 --> 06:16.707
♫ To which you gotta switch

06:16.835 --> 06:18.033
♫ Every stitch

06:18.169 --> 06:19.829
♫ Every stitch you switch

06:19.962 --> 06:24.588
♫ Think pink! Think pink
on the long, long road ahead

06:24.717 --> 06:26.127
♫ On the road

06:26.260 --> 06:30.968
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
and the world is rosy red

06:31.097 --> 06:32.591
♫ Everything's rosy

06:32.724 --> 06:35.641
♫ Everything on the great horizon

06:35.768 --> 06:38.010
♫ Everything that you can think

06:38.771 --> 06:41.855
♫ And that includes the kitchen sink

06:42.399 --> 06:43.858
♫ Think pink

06:43.984 --> 06:45.644
♫ Think pink, think pink

06:45.777 --> 06:47.236
♫ Think pink, think pink

06:47.362 --> 06:50.031
♫ Think pink, think pink,
think pink!

06:53.242 --> 06:54.701
Maggie?

06:55.286 --> 06:57.159
Dovitch! I want to see you.

06:57.287 --> 07:00.371
Girls, back to work.
Gentlemen, that will do!

07:00.499 --> 07:03.120
The Union Pacific railroad
is going to paint a whole train pink

07:03.251 --> 07:04.745
and send it on a north west tour.

07:04.878 --> 07:07.582
TWA will let me know this afternoon
if we can have a pink plane.

07:07.713 --> 07:11.047
I haven't seen a woman in two weeks
in anything but pink.

07:11.175 --> 07:14.508
- What about you?
- Me? I wouldn't be caught dead!

07:14.636 --> 07:18.468
Dovitch, I can't wait to tell you
about my feature for the next issue.

07:18.598 --> 07:22.180
It's my newest project.
And when you hear it, you will drop!

07:22.310 --> 07:24.551
- Now what?
- Just you listen.

07:24.687 --> 07:27.356
Dick Avery started working on
the pictures this morning.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.972
He's more excited about it
than any of us.

07:30.108 --> 07:34.188
Here it is. Clothes for the woman
who isn't interested in clothes.

07:34.738 --> 07:38.153
(man) Marion, give me a long look.

07:38.282 --> 07:39.362
Longer.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.115
Longer!

07:42.245 --> 07:46.243
Steve, eh, tip that back light down
a bit, will you? OK.

07:47.959 --> 07:52.419
Hold it, boys.
Beethoven isn't working. Try Brahms.

07:52.546 --> 07:56.246
Ahm, look, Marion,
I'd like to try it again.

07:56.383 --> 07:59.004
This time,
let's see if we can't get with it.

07:59.135 --> 08:02.006
Keep in mind
that you're a woman who thinks.

08:02.138 --> 08:05.008
Now, that is a piece of
sculpture by Itsabuchi.

08:05.141 --> 08:10.098
Look at it as if you understand it.
As if it understands you. See?

08:13.189 --> 08:17.317
No Marion, I'm afraid that's not the way we
look when we're thinking of Itsabuchi.

08:17.443 --> 08:20.397
React to it. Just... say it.

08:21.822 --> 08:24.906
Itsabuchi, hmm?

08:25.993 --> 08:30.072
You haven't quite got it.
Now, listen carefully.

08:30.205 --> 08:33.158
You are in the Museum of Modern Art,
Marion.

08:33.291 --> 08:36.160
Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion.

08:36.293 --> 08:39.413
You have come across this statue.
And it says something to you

08:39.546 --> 08:42.037
because you are intellectual,
always thinking.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.339
What are you thinking?

08:45.468 --> 08:48.041
I'm thinking this
is taking a long time,

08:48.179 --> 08:51.678
and I'll never be able to
pick up Harold's laundry.

08:51.974 --> 08:55.177
When Harold doesn't get his laundry,
disaster!

08:55.310 --> 09:00.186
If we don't get this fixed, you may never
see Harold's laundry or Harold again. Let's go.

09:00.315 --> 09:04.312
The woman who thinks must come
to grips with fashionable attire.

09:04.444 --> 09:08.571
A woman can be beautiful, as well
as intellectual. See facing page.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.108
And how is the facing page?

09:10.240 --> 09:14.238
The facing page looks about
as intellectual as a snake.

09:14.369 --> 09:17.121
Nonsense. Marion can be very deep.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.286
Look at her. She's reading.

09:20.416 --> 09:23.536
Marion, dear, what are you reading?

09:23.669 --> 09:25.128
Minute Men From Mars!

09:26.797 --> 09:30.212
Are we all gonna hang around,
or get somebody else?

09:30.342 --> 09:32.879
- How about Lucy Brand?
- On her honeymoon.

09:33.011 --> 09:35.680
- Betty Hayes?
- She's in jail.

09:35.805 --> 09:38.474
Are there no models around
who can think as well as they look?

09:38.599 --> 09:41.601
Marion might look better
in a different background.

09:41.728 --> 09:44.266
We can go on location.
Some intellectual hang-out.

09:44.397 --> 09:46.389
- Somewhere with books.
- A book store!

09:46.524 --> 09:50.189
Of course! One of those sinister places
in Greenwich Village. Come on, girls!

09:50.319 --> 09:54.482
Let's hurry. We might have to stop and
pick up Harold's laundry on the way.

10:02.038 --> 10:03.283
There's one.

10:04.248 --> 10:05.825
(Dick) Driver, stop here.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.416
That's sinister enough.

10:10.795 --> 10:13.417
Melissa, for heaven's sake, help me
with this lamp! It's heavy.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.873
I can't, Babs, I got my hands full.

10:22.389 --> 10:26.801
It's movingly dismal. We couldn't
have done better if we'd designed it ourselves.

10:26.935 --> 10:29.223
Marion looks smarter already.

10:29.354 --> 10:30.978
(woman screams)

10:33.733 --> 10:37.564
I'm sorry. I didn't see you up there.
Are you alright?

10:39.363 --> 10:43.941
Yes, thank you. Can I help you?
Would you like a book?

10:44.075 --> 10:47.942
- (Miss Prescott) Marion, over here.
- Who are those?

10:49.205 --> 10:50.580
May I help you?

10:50.706 --> 10:53.576
Thank you very much.
I think we have everything we need.

10:53.709 --> 10:55.666
Please tell me what all this is about.

10:55.794 --> 10:58.000
We're just going to take
a few pictures.

10:58.129 --> 10:59.707
Pictures? What sort of pictures?

10:59.839 --> 11:01.879
- Are you the owner?
- No, Dr Post is.

11:02.008 --> 11:04.296
I work here,
and I'm in charge in her absence.

11:04.427 --> 11:07.131
I'm Jo Stockton. Can you help me?

11:07.263 --> 11:09.338
How do you do? I'm Dick Avery.

11:09.473 --> 11:10.967
What about these pictures?

11:11.099 --> 11:12.724
Well, we are using the
shop as a background

11:12.851 --> 11:15.520
for some fashion pictures
for Quality magazine.

11:15.645 --> 11:19.179
I'm sorry. but I can't let you do
this. Dr Post would never approve.

11:19.315 --> 11:21.557
She doesn't approve
of fashion magazines.

11:21.692 --> 11:25.559
It's chi-chi and an unrealistic
approach to self-impressions
as well as economics.

11:25.696 --> 11:29.313
- We're going to have trouble. She's a thinker.
- She's also a talker!

11:29.449 --> 11:31.276
I must ask you to leave.

11:31.409 --> 11:33.200
We throw ourselves at your mercy.

11:33.327 --> 11:36.447
Haven't poor helpless people like us
a right to make a living?

11:36.580 --> 11:38.537
I have asked you to leave.
That is my right.

11:38.666 --> 11:40.243
If the rights of the individual

11:40.375 --> 11:43.162
are not respected by the group,
the group itself cannot exist for long.

11:43.295 --> 11:44.494
What does that mean?

11:44.630 --> 11:47.963
"Do unto others as
you would have others do unto you."

11:48.092 --> 11:50.084
We'll only do unto you for a moment,

11:50.219 --> 11:53.634
and it's no more
than we would do unto ourselves.

11:53.763 --> 11:55.886
Girls, I want all these books rearranged.

11:56.015 --> 11:59.265
They look too much alike.
They're too pat. Mix them up.

11:59.393 --> 12:01.516
No, you mustn't mix them up.

12:01.645 --> 12:04.219
The books on this shelf
pertain to empiricism,

12:04.356 --> 12:07.974
and on this shelf, materialism,
and on this, psychopiscoparalysm.

12:08.110 --> 12:11.525
Put them back. Oh, please talk to her.
It'll take me hours.

12:11.654 --> 12:14.572
One never talks to Maggie Prescott.
One only listens.

12:14.699 --> 12:18.648
Here. I think we ought to use her
in the shot. Miss, come here, please.

12:18.786 --> 12:21.952
- Me?
- You're selling a book to that girl.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.076
Her?

12:23.206 --> 12:25.531
It's very simple. Just pretend
that Marion can read.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.125
Say, listen!

12:27.252 --> 12:28.746
Alright, Marion, let's go.

12:28.878 --> 12:32.294
But this would be a violation
of all my principles!

12:32.423 --> 12:35.210
It would be hypocrisy for me
to lend myself to this sort of idealism.

12:35.342 --> 12:36.753
- I'm sorry, but...
- Shush.

12:36.885 --> 12:40.384
Now, tell Marion about the books
so that we can get out of here.

12:42.390 --> 12:46.304
This book deals with epiphenomenalism,
which has to do with consciousness

12:46.435 --> 12:49.389
as a mere accessory
of physiological processes

12:49.521 --> 12:54.432
whose presence or absence
makes no difference...

12:55.110 --> 12:57.149
Whatever are you doing?

12:57.278 --> 12:58.559
Alright, hold it!

12:58.696 --> 13:01.650
- Good. Get her in another outfit.
- Put on the shebop.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.649
None of you seems to realise you're
trespassing on private property.

13:05.786 --> 13:09.320
You run around, sublime ignorant of the fact
that I can have you put in jail.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.994
- For the last time...
- You're getting tiresome.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.536
What are you doing?

13:13.668 --> 13:15.660
Let go. Let go of my arm!

13:15.795 --> 13:19.080
I know you don't mean any harm child,
but you are in everyone's way.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.625
Now, we won't be a moment.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.211
Let me in!

13:23.343 --> 13:26.629
The air will do her good.
She was very pale.

13:35.104 --> 13:36.135
Alright, hit it.

13:36.563 --> 13:38.437
Hold it. Ready?

13:38.565 --> 13:40.356
Good. One more, please.

13:40.484 --> 13:42.559
Alright. Hit it.

13:42.694 --> 13:43.773
Hold it. Ready?

13:44.863 --> 13:47.485
Very good, Marion.
One more, please. Last one.

13:47.616 --> 13:48.814
Alright, here we go.

13:48.951 --> 13:50.409
Hit it.

13:50.535 --> 13:52.326
Hold it. Ready.

13:52.454 --> 13:55.123
OK, that's it. That ought to do.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.416
(bell rings)

14:13.389 --> 14:15.844
- Quite through?
- Thank you. You've been wonderful.

14:15.975 --> 14:18.216
We'll mention the shop
in the magazine.

14:18.352 --> 14:19.632
Don't you dare!

14:19.770 --> 14:21.596
(Miss Prescott) Taxi!

14:22.689 --> 14:23.685
(bell jingles)

14:23.815 --> 14:26.057
Oh, no!

14:28.361 --> 14:29.689
Oh!

14:29.820 --> 14:31.231
Hello there.

14:31.363 --> 14:33.486
I stayed to help you
put these things back.

14:33.615 --> 14:35.987
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
we made such a mess.

14:36.118 --> 14:38.655
Which shelf for materialism?

14:38.787 --> 14:41.028
Just hand them to me.

14:42.332 --> 14:44.573
Oh, no.

14:47.711 --> 14:49.585
You should be ashamed of yourself.

14:49.713 --> 14:51.622
I'm sorry, we don't usually
barge in that way.

14:51.757 --> 14:54.793
I mean a man of your ability
wasting his time

14:54.926 --> 14:57.796
photographing silly dresses
on silly women.

14:58.721 --> 15:02.588
Most people think they're
beautiful dresses on beautiful women.

15:02.725 --> 15:04.966
At most, a synthetic beauty.

15:06.061 --> 15:07.888
Trees are beautiful.

15:09.939 --> 15:12.264
Why don't you photograph trees?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.519
I do what I do for a living.
It has to do with supply and demand.

15:15.653 --> 15:19.068
You'd be amazed how small
the demand is for pictures of trees.

15:19.198 --> 15:21.523
My work is very pleasant,
the pay is excellent,

15:21.658 --> 15:23.567
and I get a trip to Paris every year.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.196
I certainly envy you that.

15:25.328 --> 15:28.115
I'd be in Paris now
if I could afford it.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.328
You'd have a ball.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.915
You'd go to a party every night,
drink nothing but champagne,

15:35.045 --> 15:38.496
swim in perfume, and a new love
affair every hour on the hour.

15:38.632 --> 15:42.415
If I went to Paris, it would be
to go to Emile Flostre's lectures.

15:42.552 --> 15:44.509
Who goes to Paris for lectures?

15:44.637 --> 15:47.554
Professor Flostre
is the greatest living philosopher,

15:47.682 --> 15:50.090
and father of empathicalism.

15:50.226 --> 15:52.896
Oh? What's empathicalism?

15:53.604 --> 15:58.266
The most sensible approach to
true understanding and peace of mind.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.942
Sounds great, but what is it?

16:00.069 --> 16:01.812
It's based on empathy.

16:01.945 --> 16:04.270
Do you know
what the word "empathy" means?

16:04.406 --> 16:07.323
No, I'll have to have
the beginner's course on that one.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.941
Empathy.
Is it something like sympathy?

16:10.078 --> 16:11.986
Oh, it goes beyond sympathy.

16:12.121 --> 16:14.825
Sympathy is to understand
what someone feels.

16:14.957 --> 16:17.282
Empathy is to project
your imagination

16:17.417 --> 16:21.462
so that you actually feel
what the other person is feeling.

16:21.588 --> 16:24.423
You put yourself
in the other person's place.

16:24.549 --> 16:26.790
Do I make myself clear?

16:36.977 --> 16:39.550
- Why did you do that?
- Empathy.

16:39.687 --> 16:43.637
I put myself in your place and
I felt that you wanted to be kissed.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.940
I'm afraid you put yourself
in the wrong place.

16:48.070 --> 16:51.688
I have no desire to be kissed
by you, or anyone else.

16:51.823 --> 16:55.523
Don't be silly. Everybody wants
to be kissed, even philosophers.

16:56.911 --> 17:00.077
I'm sorry, Mr Avery, we don't stock
what you're looking for.

17:00.206 --> 17:01.450
I'll let you out.

17:01.582 --> 17:04.867
Don't bother. I'll throw myself out.

17:08.671 --> 17:09.666
Goodbye.

17:11.174 --> 17:13.628

(Miss Prescott) Well, Dovitch,
what do you think?

21:35.912 --> 21:38.319
(Dovitch) They're all good models.
What have you got in mind?

21:38.456 --> 21:40.365
(Miss Prescott) A fantastic idea.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.955
It staggers me that
nobody's thought of it before.

21:43.085 --> 21:45.754
I'm going to select a girl
to be the Quality Woman.

21:45.879 --> 21:49.462
This one girl will represent everything
the magazine stands for.

21:49.591 --> 21:53.090
It's a great gimmick. Well, any
of these models would be alright.

21:53.219 --> 21:57.134
She's got to be more than alright.
She's got to have pizzazz.

21:57.265 --> 22:01.132
An entire collection is going to be designed
for her by the greatest couturier in Paris.

22:01.269 --> 22:03.676
- Paul Duval?
- Yes, Paul Duval.

22:03.813 --> 22:08.059
And he's going to let us photograph
the collection before the opening.

22:08.192 --> 22:10.564
We'll scoop every other magazine!

22:10.694 --> 22:12.900
- Staggers you, doesn't it?
- I can't believe it.

22:13.029 --> 22:17.109
Why, he would be barred from Harper's Bazaar and
Vogue, and all the other fashion magazines!

22:17.242 --> 22:21.109
Nonsense. If the project comes off,
we'll all be heroes.

22:21.245 --> 22:25.492
Wait till you see what I've got.
The girl. The Quality Woman.

22:25.624 --> 22:26.787
Oh, Marion's...

22:26.917 --> 22:29.953
Forget about Marion. This is the other girl
I'm talking about.

22:30.086 --> 22:31.995
That thing from the book shop?

22:32.130 --> 22:34.703
Maggie, she's new.

22:35.174 --> 22:36.503
She's fresh.

22:36.676 --> 22:38.253
You've gone out of your mind.

22:38.385 --> 22:41.505
One can't deny that she is, ehm,
unusual. Who is she?

22:41.638 --> 22:45.422
Don't even ask. The thought of her
makes me shudder. Dreadful, dreadful girl.

22:45.559 --> 22:47.385
If this is some sort of joke...

22:47.519 --> 22:50.970
It's no joke. If we do her over
and fix her up, she'd be great for us.

22:51.105 --> 22:52.385
She'd devour us all.

22:52.523 --> 22:54.681
- Come on, Maggie.
- Well, look at her.

22:55.859 --> 22:57.816
I think her face is perfectly funny.

22:57.945 --> 23:01.064
The Quality Woman must have grace,
elegance and pizzazz.

23:01.197 --> 23:03.867
This is the first time
I've seen you lack imagination.

23:03.992 --> 23:07.407
Every girl in Quality
has grace, elegance and pizzazz.

23:07.536 --> 23:10.905
What about a girl with character,
spirit and intelligence?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.246
That certainly would be novel
in a fashion magazine.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.332
Sir, I owe you a drink.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.369
Can you make me some black
and white enlargements?

23:17.504 --> 23:19.211
- Yes.
- Use our darkroom.

23:19.339 --> 23:22.256
- Let me study the possibilities.
- Now you are talking.

23:22.383 --> 23:25.384
- I'm not promising anything.
- You don't have to.

23:26.512 --> 23:29.845
Runs around here
like he owns the magazine!

23:29.973 --> 23:32.464
Lettie, remember that creature
in the book shop?

23:32.601 --> 23:34.308
Get her up here. Order some books.

23:34.435 --> 23:37.685
- A large order, so she can't refuse.
- $50 worth?

23:37.813 --> 23:40.351
Yes, $50 worth if necessary.

23:40.483 --> 23:44.811
$50 to get her up here. We'll have to
drug her to get her to Paris.

23:53.327 --> 23:55.996
Er, Miss Prescott, please.

23:56.122 --> 23:59.954
- Lettie, you'd better come out here.
- I've got the books she ordered.

24:00.710 --> 24:03.995
Miss Prescott's secretary
will deal with you.

24:04.672 --> 24:07.542
Oh, it's you. Well, come on in.

24:08.217 --> 24:09.415
Come on.

24:15.265 --> 24:16.759
The books are here.

24:21.562 --> 24:22.760
Come in.

24:30.653 --> 24:34.982
That'll be $52 and 75 cents,
and $1.20 for the taxi.

24:35.116 --> 24:36.942
$53.95.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.867
Drop the books.

24:38.994 --> 24:40.572
Come on, drop the books.

24:40.704 --> 24:42.946
- On the floor?
- Yes, drop them.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.702
Straighten up, shoulders back.

24:47.835 --> 24:51.880
If you girls only knew
how important posture is.

24:52.006 --> 24:54.627
Look, I didn't come here
to enroll in a military school.

24:54.758 --> 24:57.545
All I want is $53.95.

24:57.677 --> 24:59.385
The Modigliani is $12.50,

24:59.512 --> 25:02.846
and the Braque and Hieronymus Bosch
come to $22.75.

25:02.974 --> 25:05.097
$7 for the post-impressionists

25:05.226 --> 25:08.143
and $10.50 for The Egyptians -
Fourth to Seventh Dynasties

25:08.270 --> 25:12.433
make it a total of $52.75,
and there's $1.20 for the taxi.

25:12.566 --> 25:14.973
- Talks incessantly.
- The body's good.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.731
It'll be better
when we get through with it.

25:17.862 --> 25:21.231
- Through with what?
- She might do.

25:21.365 --> 25:22.776
Might do what?

25:23.701 --> 25:25.325
The bones are good.

25:25.452 --> 25:29.070
Suppose we leave my bones alone
and give me my $53.95?

25:29.206 --> 25:31.115
The eyebrows up, a light powder.

25:31.249 --> 25:34.369
I want a little rouge here.
She needs a marvelous mouth.

25:34.502 --> 25:36.993
The hair is awful. It must come off.

25:37.129 --> 25:39.702
Would you mind telling me
what all this is about?

25:40.174 --> 25:43.922
We may as well get started. Babs,
get that dreadful thing off of her.

25:44.052 --> 25:46.757
Now, wait a minute. Just a minute!

25:46.888 --> 25:48.715
Don't! Stop!

25:49.349 --> 25:52.717
This is my second and last encounter
with you lunatics.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.307
You just keep your hands off me,
all of you.

25:55.979 --> 25:59.431
I come here to make a simple delivery and I
find myself being pillaged and plundered.

25:59.567 --> 26:02.770
Well, I'll have no more of it.
I don't want my hair cut.

26:02.903 --> 26:06.237
I don't want my eyebrows up or down.
I want them where they are.

26:06.365 --> 26:11.110
And I see no functional advantage
in a marvelous mouth.

26:11.244 --> 26:14.198
I'm leaving now, and if anyone
makes a move to stop me

26:14.330 --> 26:17.200
there'll be plenty of hair cut,
and it won't be mine.

26:20.544 --> 26:21.824
Bring her back, girls, alive!

26:28.843 --> 26:30.254
(women) Hurry up.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.595
Hurry. Over here.

26:42.856 --> 26:45.525
Hey,
didn't you see that light outside?

26:46.400 --> 26:49.899
In desperation, one does not examine
one's avenue of escape.

26:50.029 --> 26:51.571
Oh, it's you.

26:54.199 --> 26:56.357
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print.

26:56.493 --> 27:00.324
That's alright.
What's all the desperation about?

27:00.455 --> 27:02.162
Those people.

27:02.290 --> 27:05.160
They don't care about
anyone's feelings.

27:05.918 --> 27:08.872
Pulling my clothes
and cutting my hair.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.005
- (knock at door)
- (woman) Is that girl in there?

27:12.132 --> 27:14.089
(whispers) Please don't give me away!

27:14.217 --> 27:16.423
Maybe you should give them
a chance...

27:16.552 --> 27:18.675
There was no one here when I came in.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.844
If you see her, hang on to her.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.177
I'll do that.

27:25.894 --> 27:30.223
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
I thought you'd make a good model.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.691
This is your idea?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.726
Yeah, I'm the one you sue.

27:35.361 --> 27:37.400
Oh, how could I be a model?

27:38.322 --> 27:41.773
I have no illusions about my looks.
I think my face is funny.

27:41.908 --> 27:43.486
That's what Maggie said.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.575
I hate to admit it,
but she's right.

27:45.703 --> 27:49.321
What you call funny,
I call interesting.

27:51.792 --> 27:54.544
It's too ridiculous
even to think about.

27:54.670 --> 27:58.370
- I couldn't do it.
- Let me be the judge of that.

27:59.049 --> 28:02.999
I wouldn't take you to Paris
if I didn't think you'd work out.

28:03.137 --> 28:06.303
- Paris?
- Yeah. Look at it this way.

28:06.431 --> 28:08.637
Modeling
may not be as bad as you think.

28:08.808 --> 28:13.019
If it is, you'll be in Paris.
You can see your friend Professor Whosis.

28:13.146 --> 28:14.770
- Flostre?
- Yeah.

28:14.897 --> 28:17.352
You can talk to him
and go to his lectures.

28:17.483 --> 28:19.522
That way it won't be a total loss.

28:20.485 --> 28:22.312
A means to an end.

28:22.446 --> 28:25.814
Or a means to a beginning,
according to how it works out.

28:25.949 --> 28:27.147
Now, let's see.

28:28.868 --> 28:30.410
There we are.

28:30.536 --> 28:33.537
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

28:33.664 --> 28:36.949
How can you possibly
make a model out of that?

28:37.084 --> 28:38.542
You can't be serious.

28:38.668 --> 28:40.910
When I'm done, you'll look like...

28:41.045 --> 28:45.707
What do you call beautiful?
A tree. You'll look like a tree.

28:46.342 --> 28:49.924
♫ Frankly, dear,
your modesty reveals to me

28:50.054 --> 28:52.627
♫ Self-appraisal often makes us sad

28:53.640 --> 28:57.340
♫ And if I add, your funny face
appeals to me

28:57.894 --> 29:00.681
♫ Please don't think
I've suddenly gone mad

29:01.939 --> 29:05.639
♫ You have all the qualities
of Peter Pan

29:06.360 --> 29:12.195
♫ I'd go far before I'd find
a sweeter pan

29:12.532 --> 29:16.660
♫ I love your funny face

29:18.704 --> 29:22.867
♫ Your sunny, funny face

29:24.960 --> 29:28.044
♫ For you're a cutie

29:28.171 --> 29:31.088
♫ With more than beauty

29:31.215 --> 29:38.095
♫ You've got a lot of
personality for me

29:38.222 --> 29:42.930
♫ You fill the air with smiles

29:43.560 --> 29:48.387
♫ For miles and miles and miles

29:49.690 --> 29:52.644
♫ Though you're no Mona Lisa

29:52.776 --> 29:55.777
♫ For worlds I'd not replace

29:55.904 --> 29:59.771
♫ Your sunny, funny face

31:00.087 --> 31:04.167
♫ I love your funny face

31:06.051 --> 31:09.466
♫ Your sunny, funny face

31:11.347 --> 31:14.134
♫ You're not exotic

31:14.267 --> 31:16.971
♫ But so hypnotic

31:17.519 --> 31:19.975
♫ You're much too much

31:20.606 --> 31:24.306
♫ If you can cook the way you look

31:24.442 --> 31:27.941
♫ I'd swim the ocean wide

31:29.655 --> 31:34.281
♫ Just to have you by my side

31:35.786 --> 31:37.992
♫ Though you're no Queen of Sheba

31:39.331 --> 31:42.533
♫ For worlds I'd not replace

31:53.093 --> 31:54.966
♫ Your sunny

31:56.137 --> 31:58.593
♫ funny

31:59.474 --> 32:02.593
♫ face

32:10.359 --> 32:11.984
(excited chatter)

32:13.028 --> 32:16.646
Ladies, feast your eyes
on our Quality Woman.

32:16.782 --> 32:18.240
Marvelous!

32:19.826 --> 32:22.399
I'm sorry about the trouble.
I didn't realise.

32:22.537 --> 32:26.534
My dear, let me do the apologizing.
I behaved abominably.

32:26.666 --> 32:29.203
She's agreed to go to Paris.
She can hardly wait.

32:29.335 --> 32:30.330
Marvelous!

32:30.461 --> 32:34.410
This is not a loss of integrity.
It is a means to an end, and...

32:34.548 --> 32:37.169
There's no time for talking.
Tell us on the plane.

32:37.300 --> 32:41.132
Alright, girls, we've got to
get cracking. To work and to Paris.

33:37.479 --> 33:41.013
- Would you like to take a guided tour of Paris?
- No no no, we're not tourists.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.390
Do we look like those people who
run around gaping all day?

33:43.526 --> 33:46.099
I guess they can't understand
anyone coming to Paris to work.

33:46.237 --> 33:49.403
We should all go straight to
our hotels and get some rest.

33:49.531 --> 33:51.773
- I am exhausted.
- I know how you feel.

33:51.908 --> 33:54.446
I'm so tired it's an effort for me
to say I'm tired.

33:54.577 --> 33:57.282
(Miss Prescott) Goodbye.
I'll be in touch.

34:14.137 --> 34:16.045
♫ I want to step out

34:16.181 --> 34:17.804
♫ Down the Champs Élysées

34:17.933 --> 34:19.639
♫ From the Arch of Triumph

34:19.768 --> 34:21.310
♫ To the Petit Palais

34:21.436 --> 34:24.056

34:38.618 --> 34:41.902

34:43.956 --> 34:46.493

of thinking men

34:46.625 --> 34:49.495
♫ Like Jean-Paul Sartre

34:51.170 --> 34:53.708
♫ I must philosophize
with all the guys

34:53.840 --> 34:57.339
♫ Around Montmartre and Montparnasse

34:57.468 --> 34:59.176
(all) ♫ I'm strictly tourist

34:59.303 --> 35:00.963

35:01.096 --> 35:02.756
♫ When they parlez-vous me

♫ Lafayette, we are here

38:53.889 --> 38:56.345
♫ Bonjour, Paris

38:56.475 --> 38:58.514
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

39:01.146 --> 39:02.344
Bonjour!

39:03.606 --> 39:05.433
Well, how was that?

39:10.612 --> 39:12.190
- Allo?
- (chatter)

39:12.322 --> 39:16.616
Duval! I can't hear myself think,
and I'm trying to think in French.

39:16.743 --> 39:19.198
- Maggie!
- Ssh! I'm calling again.

39:19.329 --> 39:21.866
I shouldn't design
a collection for you.

39:21.998 --> 39:25.615
I am jeopardizing my position
with Harper's Bazaar and Vogue,

39:25.751 --> 39:27.542
all for a girl who does not appear.

39:27.669 --> 39:32.829
You're too important for jeopardy.
Relax. She will be here without fail.

39:32.966 --> 39:36.500
You said she would be here at ten
this morning. It is now past five.

39:36.636 --> 39:38.961
- She's not at the hotel.
- Forget about her.

39:39.096 --> 39:42.595
We've started the campaign.
There isn't time to get someone else.

39:42.724 --> 39:43.756
Well, where is she?

39:43.892 --> 39:47.343
Maybe at the top of the Eiffel Tower,
or the bottom of the Seine.

39:47.479 --> 39:50.314
Maybe she's in a traffic jam.
How should I know?

39:50.440 --> 39:51.638
Oh, c'est naturel.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.772
(both) ♫ Bonjour, Paris

39:55.903 --> 39:57.646
Bonjour, bonjour.

39:57.780 --> 40:00.816
I'm throwing a shindig
to christen the Quality Woman.

40:00.949 --> 40:03.522
Leave it to Dick to find
a delicatessen in Paris.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.744
Imported all the way
from Napa Valley, CaIifornia.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.033
Melons from Florida.

40:08.164 --> 40:11.283
About the guest of honour.
Where is she? How does she look?

40:11.417 --> 40:13.623
If she's here, she looks invisible.

40:13.752 --> 40:15.461
- She didn't show?
- She did not.

40:15.588 --> 40:18.161
These gentlemen are waiting
to do her face, her hair.

40:18.299 --> 40:20.754
Duval needs measurements.
Where is she?

40:20.885 --> 40:23.755
I wouldn't like to swear in court,
but I have a pretty good idea.

40:23.887 --> 40:26.460
(Miss Prescott)
Do keep it to yourself!

40:26.598 --> 40:29.967
I'll have her here tomorrow morning
at ten o'clock without fail.

40:30.101 --> 40:32.058
In the meantime, be my guests.

40:34.939 --> 40:35.934
Strike.

40:46.616 --> 40:47.814
(beeping)

40:55.999 --> 40:57.956
Salaud! Dégueulasse!

40:58.084 --> 40:59.282
Je vous déteste!

40:59.961 --> 41:01.159
Oh, chérie!

41:02.463 --> 41:04.290
This must be the place.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.097
(band tunes up)

41:17.894 --> 41:19.092
Thank you.

41:20.813 --> 41:23.767
Monsieur, Gigi would like to dance.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.856
- Who's Gigi?
- I am Gigi.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.816
Some other time. I just stopped by
to pick up the wife and kids.

41:29.946 --> 41:34.026
All that is delicious
is not nutritious.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.323
Avaricious, av...

41:36.452 --> 41:38.658
I feel a hostile vibration.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.412
That'll be me. Sorry.

41:47.295 --> 41:48.789
Has he been that way long?

41:48.921 --> 41:51.839
Three hours.
It is the ultimate in concentration.

41:51.966 --> 41:53.709
Feels so good when you stop.

41:55.469 --> 41:58.007
I have no doubt in my mind
that in less than ten years,

41:58.138 --> 42:03.214
people everywhere will know that
only empathicalism can bring peace.

42:03.351 --> 42:06.850
Peace through understanding
is the only real...

42:07.938 --> 42:10.607
Well, hello, how are you?

42:10.733 --> 42:12.690
Just fine, thank you.
How are you?

42:12.818 --> 42:14.478
How long have you been in Paris?

42:14.611 --> 42:16.937
This is Mr Avery.
These are my friends.

42:17.073 --> 42:19.112
How do you do, boys?

42:19.241 --> 42:22.740
Would you mind if I had
my own conversation with this lady?

42:22.869 --> 42:26.036
- They don't understand English.
- You were talking English.

42:26.164 --> 42:29.912
It's hard to explain,
but it's all part of empathicalism.

42:30.042 --> 42:32.913
We don't have to communicate
with words.

42:33.045 --> 42:36.912
They understand me through the way
I feel, and the tone of my voice.

42:37.049 --> 42:40.583
- Sort of like a dog?
- Obviously, you don't understand!

42:40.719 --> 42:42.213
Who's buying the wine?

42:42.345 --> 42:44.752
- I am.
- I understand more than you think!

42:44.889 --> 42:48.423
- If you're saying that the wine...
- Let me show you something.

42:50.477 --> 42:54.309
Gentlemen, may I tell you
that you look like a mess of worms?

42:54.439 --> 42:58.271
And that you not only look like,
but you are, a mess of worms.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.808
I'll bet you've been here
all these years

43:00.945 --> 43:03.862
because if you left,
you'd be picked up for vagrancy.

43:03.989 --> 43:06.527
- Bravo.
- Your defence rests.

43:06.658 --> 43:08.781
This isn't funny.
You don't belong here.

43:08.910 --> 43:11.662
Neither do you,
which brings us to why I'm here.

43:11.788 --> 43:13.579
Monsieur, you dance with Mimi?

43:13.706 --> 43:16.162
No, thanks, I'm busy.
Didn't Gigi tell you?

43:16.292 --> 43:19.708
That's very rude,
refusing to dance with Mimi.

43:19.837 --> 43:22.754
Where I come from,
the man asks the girl to dance.

43:22.881 --> 43:24.921
You must come from the Stone Age!

43:25.050 --> 43:29.546
We think freely here. If a girl wants
to dance with a man, she asks him.

43:29.679 --> 43:33.213
We're not inhibited by
outmoded sociaI conventions.

43:33.349 --> 43:36.848
I can see that.
Do you ask men to dance with you?

43:37.561 --> 43:39.185
Isn't it time you realised

43:39.313 --> 43:43.641
that dancing is nothing more than
a form of expression or release?

43:43.775 --> 43:47.060
There's no need to be formal
or cute about it.

43:47.195 --> 43:51.524
As a matter of fact, I rather feel
like expressing myself now.

43:51.657 --> 43:53.815
And I could certainly use a release.

43:53.951 --> 43:55.990
(discordant dramatic music)

44:35.280 --> 44:37.320
(slow, moody jazz)

45:50.764 --> 45:53.220
(fast jazz)

47:30.938 --> 47:34.389
- Bonsoir. Vous étiez formidable.
- Merci.

47:34.525 --> 47:37.525
Well, you certainly made friends
and influenced people.

47:37.652 --> 47:39.941
They're empathicalists.

47:40.071 --> 47:44.697
You talk a lot about this empathy.
Ever do anything about it yourself?

47:44.825 --> 47:46.367
I don't know what you mean.

47:46.494 --> 47:50.408
- Why not throw some empathy my way?
- I still don't know what you mean.

47:50.539 --> 47:53.112
How do you think I feel when
you don't show up for the job?

47:53.250 --> 47:54.530
I'm responsible for you.

47:54.668 --> 47:58.535
An empathicalist should feel me
asking for unemployment insurance.

47:58.671 --> 48:00.249
Show up where?

48:00.381 --> 48:04.330
They've been waiting for you
at Duval's all day.

48:04.468 --> 48:07.385
I had no idea. Nobody told me.

48:07.512 --> 48:10.383
We've been calling you
on the telephone for hours.

48:12.308 --> 48:17.053
I've been at the cafe all day.
I'm terribly sorry.

48:17.188 --> 48:20.354
Now, I don't want to sound like
the personnel department,

48:20.482 --> 48:23.852
but you ought to get to bed early.
The camera picks up everything.

48:23.986 --> 48:27.022
I don't want to spend my entire
life retouching your pictures.

48:27.156 --> 48:31.070
When we're finished, you can spend
all your time making small talk.

48:31.201 --> 48:35.412
Small talk? I suppose you think
the neckline of a dress

48:35.538 --> 48:38.492
makes for world-shaking conversation?

48:38.624 --> 48:41.791
Anything you don't understand,
you call small talk.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.955
- What do you think of Flostre?
- Don't change the subject.

48:45.089 --> 48:47.923
- It's the same subject.
- I haven't met Flostre.

48:48.050 --> 48:51.584
You haven't? By now
I thought you two'd be buddies.

48:51.719 --> 48:55.847
You don't find Flostre in cafes,
except on special occasions.

48:55.973 --> 48:59.389
Not everyone interested in
empathicalism meets him,

48:59.518 --> 49:02.435
any more than every American
meets the President.

49:02.562 --> 49:05.896
An invitation to Flostre's home
is a great honour,

49:06.024 --> 49:08.479
and as hard to get
as an invitation to...

49:08.610 --> 49:10.353
The White House.

49:10.486 --> 49:13.238
I don't think jokes about
professor Flostre are funny.

49:13.364 --> 49:16.779
No more jokes. But let's be friendly.
We have to work together you know.

49:16.909 --> 49:21.202
You don't have to be friendly
to work together. Acquainted will do.

49:21.329 --> 49:23.618
Am I supposed to
go over to Duval's now?

49:23.748 --> 49:25.575
I said you'd be there
at 10:30 in the morning.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.582
- I'll be there.
- Promise?

49:27.710 --> 49:29.537
I said I'd be there, and I will.

49:29.670 --> 49:32.339
- Alright.
- This is where I get off, good night.

49:32.798 --> 49:35.585
Wait a minute. Don't go away mad.

49:35.717 --> 49:39.845
Can't we walk and get friendly,
or better acquainted, or something?

49:39.971 --> 49:42.426
No, thanks. I've got to go to bed.

49:42.557 --> 49:46.554
I don't want you spending
your life retouching my pictures.

49:46.685 --> 49:48.428
You are mad, aren't you?

49:50.439 --> 49:52.265
No, I'm not mad, I...

49:54.192 --> 49:57.276
I'm hurt, and disappointed, and...

49:58.738 --> 49:59.936
..and mad.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.250
(clattering)

50:32.769 --> 50:35.935
♫ I didn't mean to
start any scene to

50:36.064 --> 50:38.733
♫ Make you sigh, or to die

50:39.317 --> 50:42.317
♫ It's most immoral
for us to quarrel

50:42.444 --> 50:45.480
♫ Why can't we both agree?

50:45.614 --> 50:49.314
♫ Don't you know Ben Franklin
wrote about this thing at length?

50:49.451 --> 50:53.115
♫ On the proposition that
in union there is strength

50:54.080 --> 50:58.029
♫ Why raise a storm up
if we'll just warm up?

50:58.167 --> 51:03.955
♫ We'll be much stronger

51:09.177 --> 51:12.462
♫ For I need you, and you need me

51:13.597 --> 51:15.673
♫ Let's kiss and make up

♫ And out the doorway

51:28.986 --> 51:30.943

52:36.839 --> 52:38.333
(Spanish music)

54:54.254 --> 54:56.294
(chatter)

55:00.093 --> 55:02.216
What are they doing?
They've been in there for hours!

55:02.345 --> 55:04.384
There was a lot to be done.

55:05.765 --> 55:08.884
- They don't look happy.
- They don't look unhappy.

55:10.811 --> 55:12.934
I can't tell. Do they look pleased?

55:13.063 --> 55:16.017
- They don't look displeased.
- (Duval) Everyone.

55:16.149 --> 55:18.437
- Maybe this is the grand finale.
- I'm getting nervous.

55:18.568 --> 55:20.809
- You should.
- Sit down.

55:20.945 --> 55:26.531
My friends, you saw enter here a waif,
a gamin, a IowIy caterpillar.

55:27.409 --> 55:31.109
We open the cocoon but
it is not a butterfly that emerges.

55:31.246 --> 55:36.156
- It's not?
- No, it is a bird of paradise.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.247
Lights!

55:40.546 --> 55:41.541
Curtain!

56:01.898 --> 56:03.096
Oh...

56:29.798 --> 56:33.547
- Beautiful! I don't believe it.
- Maggie, what did I tell you?

56:33.678 --> 56:36.464
You look absolutely fabulous.
How does it feel?

56:36.597 --> 56:38.720
It feels wonderful, but it's not me.

56:38.849 --> 56:41.386
The hair, the dress. It's perfection.

56:41.518 --> 56:44.139
You see how much we accomplish
when you appear?

56:44.270 --> 56:48.647
Try to stay with us for a while.
Duval shows the collection on Friday.

56:48.774 --> 56:51.561
The night before,
we'll introduce you to the press.

56:51.694 --> 56:54.564
It is your great opportunity.
It will be your evening.

56:54.696 --> 56:56.854
- You will be there?
- Yes, of course.

56:56.990 --> 56:59.481
Dick, that gives you a week
to photograph her.

56:59.617 --> 57:02.820
I want marvelous pictures.
Give me a lot of pizzazz.

57:02.954 --> 57:06.654
Take her, and whatever you do,
don't let her out of your sight.

57:07.499 --> 57:09.990
Now, just do what I tell you.
Don't worry about it.

57:10.127 --> 57:14.290
Now here, hold these balloons high
in the air, and when I say "run",

57:14.422 --> 57:17.755
run as fast as you can
and don't let the balloons go.

57:17.884 --> 57:20.505
Run as fast as I can
and don't let the balloons go.

57:20.678 --> 57:22.966
Right. Now, ready?

57:23.097 --> 57:26.097
Head up a little. You're so happy.

57:26.224 --> 57:27.802
Alright, run!

57:27.934 --> 57:29.132
Run!

57:29.269 --> 57:31.178
What? Oh, why did I ever...

57:31.854 --> 57:34.345
- What's wrong?
- I don't know which way to go.

57:34.482 --> 57:35.940
That way.

57:36.067 --> 57:39.186
I'm sorry, I'm terribly nervous.
I've never done anything like this.

57:39.319 --> 57:43.186
There's nothing to be nervous about.
You're in Paris, the Tuileries.

57:43.323 --> 57:47.237
You've got balloons. There's
a sudden shower. You're very happy.

57:47.368 --> 57:50.073
- Why am I so happy?
- Because I say you are.

57:51.705 --> 57:54.825
That's all you have to know.
You're happy. Now, run!

57:56.084 --> 57:57.282
Great. That's great.

57:57.419 --> 57:58.617
Now, stop!

57:59.629 --> 58:00.827
Wonderful!

58:09.430 --> 58:11.387
Now listen closely, today you're not happy.

58:11.515 --> 58:14.006
- I'm hurt and...
- Right, now you're a creature of tragedy.

58:14.142 --> 58:17.226
Heartbroken, suffering.
You're Anna Karenina.

58:17.770 --> 58:19.597
Shall I throw myself under the train?

58:19.731 --> 58:24.107
We'll see. For now, just wonderful,
noble self-sacrifice.

58:24.485 --> 58:26.940
Your lover
has just kissed you goodbye.

58:30.407 --> 58:33.194
You may never know that kiss again,
or love again.

58:33.326 --> 58:35.652
Marcel, put some tears in her eyes.

58:38.623 --> 58:40.415
There are tears in her eyes.

58:40.542 --> 58:43.377
Good. You're not only a model,
you're an actress.

58:43.503 --> 58:49.125
Jo, give me the works.
Heartbreak, longing, tragedy.

58:49.258 --> 58:50.882
Wet your lips.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.132
Good. Alright. Now, la steam!

58:54.262 --> 58:55.258
La steam!

58:55.388 --> 58:57.760
That's great. Just like the movie.

58:57.891 --> 58:59.764
Poor Anna Karenina.

58:59.892 --> 59:01.470
No, not too much steam.

59:01.602 --> 59:05.682
Cut down the steam.
That's wonderful. That's it.

59:08.775 --> 59:13.152
Good. Now give her some flowers.
Flowers. Arms full.

59:13.279 --> 59:16.280
Alright. More. More. More!

59:16.657 --> 59:19.230
Alright, Jo, it's spring.
You're in love.

59:19.368 --> 59:22.369
Now, turn around. Fabulous!

59:29.627 --> 59:31.916
(Tristan und Isolde by Wagner)

59:37.009 --> 59:39.167
Now, you're walking out of the opera,

59:39.303 --> 59:42.256
leaving to the lush passionate
music of Tristan and Isolde.

59:42.389 --> 59:44.714
- You're very unhappy.
- What happened now?

59:44.849 --> 59:46.925
A rendezvous at the opera.
Two seats.

59:47.059 --> 59:49.052
He didn't show up. You're furious.

59:49.186 --> 59:53.515
When I say go, walk down with fire
in your eyes and murder on your mind.

59:53.649 --> 59:54.847
Wet your lips.

59:55.275 --> 59:59.107
You're Isolde. You're a queen.
Now, go, go, go!

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.901
You're furious at Tristan.

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.656
That's great.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.250
(horn blows)

01:00:18.379 --> 01:00:20.537
Today,
you're just a simple little girl.

01:00:20.673 --> 01:00:24.504
You live on the Seine river, and you're
trying to catch a fish for your lunch.

01:00:25.636 --> 01:00:28.672
Jo, fish! I want you
to look like you're fishing.

01:00:28.805 --> 01:00:31.592
I'm trying,
but I've never fished before.

01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:35.508
That's quite obvious. You might
just as well be flying a kite.

01:00:36.646 --> 01:00:38.603
Don't look like such an amateur.

01:00:38.773 --> 01:00:40.184
You're just not fishing!

01:00:40.316 --> 01:00:43.400
I am, but it's caught on something.

01:00:43.528 --> 01:00:45.899
Well, give it a yank.

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.069
Pretend you caught a fish.
Pull it out.

01:00:49.575 --> 01:00:51.152
Marvelous!

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:59.449
- Here's what I want you to be.
- I know. I'm a princess at a ball.

01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:03.830
The bird is really Prince Charming,
turned into a bird by a wicked sorcerer.

01:01:03.962 --> 01:01:06.536
But we've decided
not to let it spoil the ball

01:01:06.673 --> 01:01:09.674
and to go on dancing
as if nothing had happened.

01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:11.425
You've outgrown me.

01:01:12.512 --> 01:01:15.631
Alright. Now, give him a kiss.

01:01:16.098 --> 01:01:19.514
He's your Prince Charming, isn't he?
Well, get happy!

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:22.055
That's a killer.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.890
Alright, Marcel, lights!

01:01:32.154 --> 01:01:35.025
Jo! Jo, where are you?

01:01:36.074 --> 01:01:38.779
Tell me when you're ready. Say "go".

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.152
I'm ready. What are you gonna do?

01:01:41.287 --> 01:01:44.656
Never mind what I'm going to do.
Just say "go".

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.744
Alright. Go!

01:01:50.254 --> 01:01:53.420
Holy Moses! You look fabulous!

01:01:53.548 --> 01:01:54.746
Look, stop.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.665
Stop!

01:01:56.801 --> 01:02:01.048
- I can't stop. Take the picture.
- Stop!

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:05.094
I don't want to stop. I like it.
Take the picture.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.818
(children singing)

01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:29.445
Alright, this is your wedding day,
the happiest day of your life.

01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:32.914
Bells are ringing, flowers blooming,
angels singing.

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:37.538
The man you love more than anyone
is inside the church waiting for you.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.500
What's the matter?

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.586
I just feel so dishonest standing
here in this wedding dress.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.049
It's not the happiest day of my life.
And there's no one's waiting for me anywhere.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:53.310
But you weren't Anna Karenina.
The bird wasn't Prince Charming.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.761
- Please, Dick.
- I don't understand.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.521
Yes, I know.

01:02:57.648 --> 01:03:00.104
Oh, mais quelle mariée charmante!

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:03.685
On ne m'avaitpas dit qu'ily aurait
un mariage aujourd'hui.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.935
Mais entrez donc.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:07.147
I'm afraid you got us wrong Padre,
we're not here to get married.

01:03:07.282 --> 01:03:11.030
- Such a beautiful bride.
- This is not my dress.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.868
We're here to take some pictures.

01:03:12.995 --> 01:03:17.040
Nous sommes ici pour photographie,
pour la magazine de la fashion.

01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:20.415
I'm sorry. Perhaps we should've
asked your permission first.

01:03:20.544 --> 01:03:23.544
No wedding? Aah, quel dommage!

01:03:23.671 --> 01:03:25.213
Merci.

01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:27.545
Jo!

01:03:32.888 --> 01:03:34.465
Jo?

01:03:37.517 --> 01:03:40.850
I'm terribly sorry. I don't know
what's the matter with me.

01:03:40.979 --> 01:03:44.561
Forget it and relax.
We've been working too hard.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.181
I suppose we'll be going home soon?

01:03:47.318 --> 01:03:49.191
That's it. You're probably homesick.

01:03:49.319 --> 01:03:53.364
Well, just this last picture,
then you'll be through.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.609
- And then what happens?
- We go home.

01:03:57.327 --> 01:03:58.358
And then?

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:00.614
What do you mean?

01:04:00.746 --> 01:04:02.537
Will I see you any more?

01:04:02.665 --> 01:04:05.998
And how! If you model, I can get you
all the bookings you can handle

01:04:06.126 --> 01:04:09.577
- We'd be working together every day.
- I'll model.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.670
Good. We'll put you to work right now.

01:04:11.798 --> 01:04:15.297
Stand here, please.
There's a good place. Fine.

01:04:18.762 --> 01:04:19.758
Lovely.

01:04:19.888 --> 01:04:22.842
Now, tip your head just a little bit.

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:26.175
Good. A little smile.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.059
Jo.

01:04:32.108 --> 01:04:33.139
Yes?

01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:35.645
Something is wrong.

01:04:36.612 --> 01:04:38.319
No. Why?

01:04:38.447 --> 01:04:41.117
You're the saddest looking
bride I've ever seen.

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:43.483
You look as if you've been jilted.

01:04:43.619 --> 01:04:45.695
This is your wedding day.

01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:49.778
The day you've dreamt of all your life.
You're marrying the man you love.

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.873
The man who loves you.

01:04:52.919 --> 01:04:54.117
He's the only...

01:04:55.213 --> 01:04:56.790
And you're...

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:08.721
Oh Dick, I thought
it would never happen.

01:05:10.226 --> 01:05:13.641
I never want to go home.
I love Paris!

01:05:13.771 --> 01:05:17.934
I love these clothes and
the little church. And I love you.

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:23.609
What did you say?

01:05:23.738 --> 01:05:25.896
I love Paris.

01:05:26.032 --> 01:05:27.823
That's not what I heard.

01:05:30.619 --> 01:05:32.078
My, my, my...!

01:05:34.873 --> 01:05:36.664
Well, what do you know!

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.127
♫ He loves

01:05:41.087 --> 01:05:42.878
♫ And she loves

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.832
♫ And they love

01:05:46.383 --> 01:05:50.795
♫ So why can't... you love

01:05:51.179 --> 01:05:56.137
♫ And I love too?

01:05:58.853 --> 01:06:00.596
♫ Birds love

01:06:00.729 --> 01:06:02.852
♫ And bees love

01:06:03.774 --> 01:06:07.522
♫ And whispering trees love

01:06:08.445 --> 01:06:10.236
♫ And that's what

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:14.862
♫ We both should do

01:06:18.745 --> 01:06:22.790
♫ I aIways knew someday

01:06:24.042 --> 01:06:26.829
♫ You'd come along

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.668
♫ We'll make a twosome

01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:36.214
♫ That just can't go wrong

01:06:37.179 --> 01:06:39.218
♫ Darling

01:06:41.057 --> 01:06:42.885
♫ He loves

01:06:43.727 --> 01:06:45.518
♫ And she loves

01:06:45.645 --> 01:06:47.934
♫ And they love

01:06:48.064 --> 01:06:52.690
♫ So won't you love me

01:06:53.653 --> 01:07:00.271
♫ As I love you?

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:27.214
Armande, let me see
a breeze in the trees.

01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:30.215
Not too much.
I don't want a cyclone.

01:10:30.347 --> 01:10:31.806
Fountains.

01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:36.595
It's thrilling!
It makes me cry for the Carolines.

01:10:36.728 --> 01:10:39.265
The correspondent from Pakistan
has just accepted.

01:10:39.397 --> 01:10:42.433
The correspondent from
Madrid finally will be
able to make it after all.

01:10:42.566 --> 01:10:45.602
And the man from the Istanbul
press will be at the presentation.

01:10:45.736 --> 01:10:47.694
Good. Now, where on earth is Jo?

01:10:48.364 --> 01:10:49.443
Here she is.

01:10:49.573 --> 01:10:52.325
Thank heavens.
I thought you'd stand us up again.

01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:55.156
- How did the wedding pictures go?
- Wonderfully.

01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:57.160
Yes, he's a marvelous photographer.

01:10:57.289 --> 01:11:01.368
All you have to do is sit there.
I make my speech to the press,

01:11:01.501 --> 01:11:04.418
the curtains will open
and you dazzle 'em!

01:11:04.545 --> 01:11:06.870
- Give 'em the old pizzazz.
- I'll try.

01:11:07.006 --> 01:11:09.331
Afterward, I will introduce
you to them personally.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:11.755
Be charming and answer
all of their questions.

01:11:11.885 --> 01:11:15.301
- Well, what sort of questions?
- It's remarkably simple.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:17.837
I've been written editorials
on it for years.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:19.717
As one lady to another...

01:11:19.851 --> 01:11:22.472
We ought to look like
one lady to another.

01:11:22.603 --> 01:11:25.176
They'll want to know
who does your hair,

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.231
what you eat, drink,
what sheets you sleep on.

01:11:28.358 --> 01:11:31.312
You're the authority
on how to be lovely.

01:11:31.444 --> 01:11:33.271
What am I going to tell them?

01:11:33.404 --> 01:11:35.527
Just listen and repeat after me.

01:11:36.365 --> 01:11:39.485
♫ On how to be lovely

01:11:39.618 --> 01:11:42.738
♫ You gotta be happy

01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:44.863
♫ When you can feel light and gay

01:11:44.998 --> 01:11:48.782
♫ Then you'll be lovely as a holiday

01:11:49.085 --> 01:11:52.002
♫ On how to be charming

01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:55.000
♫ You gotta be merry

01:11:55.132 --> 01:11:57.421
♫ If only to weave a spell

01:11:57.551 --> 01:12:02.212
♫ And you'll be
lovely as a carousel, too

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:06.760
♫ I know you can show how

01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:09.727
♫ It's all in the know-how

01:12:09.853 --> 01:12:12.890
♫ And once you know, oh how

01:12:13.023 --> 01:12:14.647
♫ The world looks good to you

01:12:14.775 --> 01:12:16.684
♫ As it should to you

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.147
♫ On how to be lovely

01:12:20.279 --> 01:12:23.482
♫ You gotta be jolly

01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:25.276
♫ When you can be fancy-free

01:12:25.743 --> 01:12:30.203
♫ And flash a smile that folks
come flocking to see

01:12:32.666 --> 01:12:36.248
♫ You'll be as lovely as can be

01:13:06.447 --> 01:13:09.447
♫ Can't do it with make-up

01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:12.148
♫ You just gotta wake up

01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:15.366
♫ And starting to take up

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.158
♫ The life delirious

01:13:17.582 --> 01:13:19.159
♫ Nothing serious

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:22.911
♫ On how to be lovely

01:13:23.045 --> 01:13:25.666
♫ You gotta be cheery

01:13:25.797 --> 01:13:28.086
♫ I'll give you a guarantee

01:13:28.216 --> 01:13:30.007
♫ You don't need dough

01:13:30.134 --> 01:13:33.135
♫ You don't need a college degree

01:13:35.056 --> 01:13:38.424
♫ Make sorrow incidental

01:13:38.559 --> 01:13:41.096
♫ Let joy be monumental

01:13:41.228 --> 01:13:45.723
♫ And you'll be lovely

01:13:52.279 --> 01:13:55.778
♫ You'll be as lovely as can be

01:14:08.419 --> 01:14:10.494
Ah, beautiful!

01:14:11.672 --> 01:14:13.249
Beautiful!

01:14:13.381 --> 01:14:14.959
These are not my clothes.

01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:18.709
They were Ient me for tonight.
I'm being presented to the press.

01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:21.845
Alors! Your picture will be
in all the newspapers?

01:14:21.972 --> 01:14:22.968
Oh, yes.

01:14:23.098 --> 01:14:26.134
And they'll ask me
all sorts of questions.

01:14:26.268 --> 01:14:27.382
Oh!

01:14:27.519 --> 01:14:31.599
I think perhaps you had better stay
here with me, huh?

01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:33.644
Hello!

01:14:36.068 --> 01:14:38.524
Don't you remember me?
Jo Stockton?

01:14:38.654 --> 01:14:39.982
C'est Jo!

01:14:40.114 --> 01:14:43.482
On vous a manquée, mais on n'a pas
le temps de s'arréter maintenant.

01:14:43.617 --> 01:14:46.487
Flostre part au café
et on est déjé en retard. Au revoir.

01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:49.620
What were they saying about Flostre?

01:14:49.747 --> 01:14:53.959
That he is speaking at the café
and that they are late.

01:15:07.139 --> 01:15:09.380
Mr Avery will be by in five minutes.

01:15:09.516 --> 01:15:12.007
Will you ask him to pick me up at the cafe?

01:15:18.774 --> 01:15:20.482
Vous retrouverez tout cela

01:15:20.609 --> 01:15:22.317
Á travers tous mes écrits
sur l'empathicalisme.

01:15:22.444 --> 01:15:25.361
La spiritualité
inhérente á I'empathicalisme

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:29.652
matérialise les plus nobles aspects
de la nature humaine.

01:15:29.784 --> 01:15:31.741
Consciemment ou inconsciemment,

01:15:31.869 --> 01:15:34.739
elle est perceptible
dans tout ce qui nous touche.

01:15:34.872 --> 01:15:39.414
Dans nos meilleures sculptures...
Et dans notre meilleure littérature.

01:15:48.801 --> 01:15:50.176
Pardon, monsieur.

01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:53.173
Je suis... terribly sorry.

01:15:53.305 --> 01:15:55.878
- I...
- Quite alright, mademoiselle.

01:15:56.016 --> 01:15:57.214
You're quite welcome.

01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:04.518
Etudiez la statue un instant.
Je reviens tout de suite.

01:16:08.235 --> 01:16:09.812
Now, mademoiselle.

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:12.945
I can't believe it.
I thought you'd be old!

01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:15.777
Well, I mean, a philosopher
and professor.

01:16:15.908 --> 01:16:18.909
It all suggests age.
I mean, maturity.

01:16:19.036 --> 01:16:21.029
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

01:16:21.163 --> 01:16:25.741
Not at all. There's no reason why someone
brilliant shouldn't be young.

01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:29.539
I find myself
at an awkward disadvantage.

01:16:31.047 --> 01:16:33.086
You know who I am.

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:38.378
But except that you are
very charming, I don't know you.

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:42.343
I'm so excited about meeting you,
I forgot to introduce myself.

01:16:42.474 --> 01:16:45.677
If only you knew how anxious
I am to talk to you.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.645
I came from New York
just to see you!

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:52.720
You couldn't have a more loyal
disciple of empathicalism than I.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:57.236
- Than whom?
- I'm sorry. I'm Jo Stockton.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:01.108
I'm enchanted,... Miss Stockton.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:07.619
And since you've come such a long way
to talk with me,

01:17:07.747 --> 01:17:10.238
by all means, let's talk.

01:17:16.338 --> 01:17:18.876
(Jo) ..there's so much
you can teach us.

01:17:19.007 --> 01:17:21.000
(Flostre) I may go next year.

01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:24.669
You must see Greenwich Village.
It's our Left Bank.

01:17:24.804 --> 01:17:28.089
People there think, and do things.
Useful things.

01:17:28.224 --> 01:17:31.225
- Do you live in Greenwich Village?
- Of course.

01:17:31.352 --> 01:17:35.515
Then I will certainly come. Perhaps we
can do useful things together.

01:17:35.647 --> 01:17:39.098
I'm sure that in all America
there's no empathicalist

01:17:39.234 --> 01:17:40.858
as charming as you.

01:17:40.985 --> 01:17:43.310
Well, I hate to throw
a wet blanket...

01:17:43.446 --> 01:17:46.400
Darling, guess who this is.
You'll never guess!

01:17:46.532 --> 01:17:49.201
- Your brother?
- Professor Flostre.

01:17:49.326 --> 01:17:53.904
- This is Dick Avery.
- Professor? I thought you'd be old.

01:17:54.039 --> 01:17:57.123
- So did I. Aren't you surprised?
- I'm overcome.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:01.081
For you, my dear,
I promise never to grow old.

01:18:01.212 --> 01:18:03.619
- Come on, Jo.
- What's the matter?

01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:05.547
We've got to get over to Duval's.

01:18:05.674 --> 01:18:08.544
Must you go so soon?
I was just beginning to know you.

01:18:08.677 --> 01:18:11.880
Couldn't I stay?
The professor wants to talk to me.

01:18:12.013 --> 01:18:15.547
- You've heard it all before.
- Have you lost your mind?

01:18:15.683 --> 01:18:18.637
- We'll talk about that later.
- What are you doing?

01:18:18.769 --> 01:18:21.770
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life!

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:25.100
What's got into you?
Have you any idea...

01:18:28.987 --> 01:18:31.062
How could you be so rude?

01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:34.032
Embarrassing me
in front of Professor Flostre!

01:18:34.158 --> 01:18:36.399
What am I going to tell him?

01:18:36.535 --> 01:18:40.781
You're not gonna tell him anything.
You'll never see him again.

01:18:40.914 --> 01:18:44.080
- Not going to see him again?
- That's what I said.

01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:46.331
Now, just a moment...

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.876
I went through all this nonsense
to meet this man.

01:18:50.005 --> 01:18:51.630
So I could talk to him.

01:18:53.467 --> 01:18:57.216
I worship everything he stands for.
The way he thinks.

01:18:57.346 --> 01:19:00.133
You might as well tell me
never to eat again.

01:19:00.933 --> 01:19:04.183
The man from Herald Tribune has brought
a correspondent from Sweden.

01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:06.552
- The more the merrier.
- They are here, Miss Prescott.

01:19:06.688 --> 01:19:09.226
Get them quiet, Duval.
I'll be right back.

01:19:09.357 --> 01:19:13.354
When a man looks at a woman
the way Flostre looks at you,
it doesn't take any imagination...

01:19:13.486 --> 01:19:15.525
(all speak at once)

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:22.318
If you weren't so serious,
this would be terribly funny.

01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:25.287
I'll check the lights,
then I make my speech.

01:19:25.413 --> 01:19:26.788
Everybody, ready!

01:19:26.914 --> 01:19:28.823
Flostre may be the
quiz kid of the centure,

01:19:28.958 --> 01:19:31.793
the greatest philosopher
since Aristotle.

01:19:31.919 --> 01:19:35.418
But he's also a man.
He's more man than philosopher!

01:19:35.547 --> 01:19:38.548
Are you suggesting that
Flostre's interest in me is
anything but intellectual?

01:19:38.675 --> 01:19:41.166
He's as interested in your intellect
as I am.

01:19:41.302 --> 01:19:42.465
(fanfare)

01:19:42.595 --> 01:19:45.679
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
my friends.

01:19:45.806 --> 01:19:49.673
I have asked you here to meet
the woman selected to represent

01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:53.937
the most discriminating
publication in the world, Quality.

01:19:54.064 --> 01:19:56.471
Let's forget it
and get this over with.

01:19:56.607 --> 01:19:57.722
Forget it?

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:01.192
Attack Flostre and you attack
the things I believe in.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.274
We're fortunate to have found out
these things now.

01:20:04.406 --> 01:20:06.861
I'm certain you'll not be
disappointed.

01:20:06.992 --> 01:20:10.158
She is a rare creature...
chosen from hundreds

01:20:10.286 --> 01:20:13.869
for her appearance, her grace,
her poise...

01:20:13.998 --> 01:20:16.868
and her ineffable charm.

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:19.456
We can never
reconcile our differences.

01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:21.246
They are too basic and too elemental.

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.546
This is not the time or place
to discuss our differences.

01:20:24.674 --> 01:20:26.583
Please, let's get this show on.

01:20:26.718 --> 01:20:29.802
Yes, the show! Our personal lives
couldn't matter less, could they?

01:20:29.929 --> 01:20:33.712
- Would you please sit down?
- Leave me alone!

01:20:37.769 --> 01:20:40.604
May I present the Quality Woman!

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:42.769
(fanfare)

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:15.541
(Miss Prescott)
What does that one say?

01:21:15.679 --> 01:21:19.379
All of them say the same thing.
Everyone in Paris is laughing.

01:21:19.516 --> 01:21:22.801
- I'm not.
- I should think you wouldn't be,
this is all your fault.

01:21:22.935 --> 01:21:26.719
I know. I said some things last
night I shouldn't have said. She got upset.

01:21:26.856 --> 01:21:29.975
- Just a lovers' quarrel.
- A what?

01:21:30.109 --> 01:21:33.062
- You mean, you and that girl...
- Why not?

01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:35.483
Impossible!
You're in the fashion world.

01:21:35.613 --> 01:21:38.318
We're cold, artificial
and without sentiment.

01:21:38.449 --> 01:21:41.699
- How can you possibly be in love?
- I'm a black sheep.

01:21:41.827 --> 01:21:45.161
What about my collection?
Without her I cannot show it.

01:21:45.289 --> 01:21:48.408
- The gowns were sewn on her!
- I'm facing ruin!

01:21:48.542 --> 01:21:51.115
Don't worry, she'll show up.
The girl has integrity.

01:21:51.252 --> 01:21:55.250
She's filled with virtues.
Only she's not wasting them on us.

01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:57.836
I went to the cafe, but she isn't there.

01:21:57.967 --> 01:21:59.046
So where is she?

01:21:59.176 --> 01:22:02.046
She's at her hotel,
but she won't take messages.

01:22:02.179 --> 01:22:06.342
So I bribed the desk clerk into
letting me copy her phone messages.

01:22:07.934 --> 01:22:11.137
"At 10:15, Dick Avery called."

01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:13.843
"At 11:30, Dick Avery called."

01:22:15.232 --> 01:22:18.850
"At 12:16, Professor Flostre called."

01:22:20.028 --> 01:22:22.649
Lousy, rotten good-for-nothing!

01:22:24.199 --> 01:22:27.982
"Having an evening of international
philosophy, poetry,

01:22:28.119 --> 01:22:30.954
song and meditation tonight
at my salon."

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.373
"Would be delighted if you would
join us. Emile Flostre."

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.623
Obviously, that's where she'll be tonight.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.910
Not showing my collection.
I'm ruined.

01:22:40.046 --> 01:22:42.797
I'll go to Flostre's tonight
and bring her back.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:46.506
And take someone who isn't
emotionally involved. Like me.

01:22:46.635 --> 01:22:47.880
You'll never get in.

01:22:48.011 --> 01:22:51.961
Empathicalists have a very firm
way of dealing with what they
call hostile vibrations.

01:22:52.098 --> 01:22:54.969
Let's turn into
a couple of friendly vibrations.

01:22:55.101 --> 01:22:58.552
Until we get in. As they say,
if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.

01:23:07.947 --> 01:23:10.947
- Do I look grubby enough?
- Yeah. How's the beard?

01:23:11.075 --> 01:23:13.151
- Full of pizzazz.
- Come on.

01:23:16.538 --> 01:23:18.198
Oui? Qui est vous?

01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:20.904
Nous sommes voyager ici
pour la meditation.

01:23:21.042 --> 01:23:22.322
Quels noms?

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.456
La.

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:26.954
Ah! Monsieur et Madame Barker
de Florida.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.876
- Florida.
- That's us. De Tallahassee.

01:23:31.009 --> 01:23:32.468
Bon. Entrez.

01:23:32.594 --> 01:23:34.882
- Come on, sugar.
- Alright, darlin'.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.555
- Où est Flostre?
- Pourquoi?

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:43.761
I don't know. I just asked.

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:51.650
♫ On me demande

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:54.695
- (woman sobs)
- ♫ Pourquois l'ai tué

01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:56.482
C'est triste!

01:23:56.615 --> 01:23:59.782
- What's the matter?
- The song's a bundle of laughs.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:06.030
♫ Un moment de passion engageante
Je le détestais

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:08.870
She stabbed her lover
because she hated him.

01:24:09.001 --> 01:24:11.575
♫ Mais quande l'ai vu

01:24:12.546 --> 01:24:16.211
♫ Mort, froid, et massacré

01:24:16.341 --> 01:24:19.176
Now that the poor thing is dead...

01:24:19.302 --> 01:24:24.213
♫ Tout d'un coup, je savais bien
Que je l'ai aimé

01:24:24.348 --> 01:24:26.756
Now that he's dead, she loves him.

01:24:27.935 --> 01:24:29.844
♫ Ma téte éclate

01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:35.431
♫ Je suis complétement dérangée

01:24:35.567 --> 01:24:38.402
This kid's a little confused.

01:24:38.528 --> 01:24:40.650
♫ Et maintenant

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.068
♫ Il n'y a plus rien

01:24:43.199 --> 01:24:45.274
♫ Il n'y a qu'un seul reméde

01:24:45.409 --> 01:24:47.069
Now she's gonna get even.

01:24:47.202 --> 01:24:50.737
- ♫ Je vais mejeter sur la rue
- She's gonna kill herself.

01:24:50.872 --> 01:24:52.911
♫ Corbillard

01:24:56.127 --> 01:24:58.166
(man) C'est tragique!

01:24:58.295 --> 01:25:01.000
- C'est tragique!
- You can say that again.

01:25:01.131 --> 01:25:02.045
Hey!

01:25:07.638 --> 01:25:09.180
Look up the airstay.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.678
We're on the wrong floor.

01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:15.435
Un moment, s'il vous plaît.

01:25:15.562 --> 01:25:18.598
Suivez moi.
Il me semble qu'ily a une erreur.

01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:21.518
Ily a un autre couple
qui s'appelle Barker de Florida.

01:25:21.651 --> 01:25:23.726
Oh-oh, the real Barkers.

01:25:23.861 --> 01:25:25.569
Now what's this all about?

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:30.698
- They are not from Tallahassee!
- They ain't even from Miami.

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:33.530
I've never seen these people
in Tallahassee,

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:36.911
and I have been in every corner
of Tallahassee.

01:25:37.039 --> 01:25:40.704
- Is this some sort of a gag?
- I know who he is!

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:44.535
- Il est un photographer de fashion.
- Fashion?!

01:25:44.671 --> 01:25:47.292
She's a fashion editor.
Get 'em out!

01:25:47.424 --> 01:25:50.175
At once,
or Mr Flostre will hear about this.

01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:53.836
Now, wait, we're spiritual singers
on a tour and...

01:25:53.971 --> 01:25:56.544
Now the hostile vibrations
have gone...

01:25:56.682 --> 01:25:58.805

01:30:21.003 --> 01:30:24.502
(Jo) Intellectual gratification
is imperatively nonexistent.

01:30:24.631 --> 01:30:29.044
- Only you can fulfill that potential.
- This is it.

01:30:30.261 --> 01:30:33.345
- Flostre, there you are.
- Professor, we need you!

01:30:33.473 --> 01:30:37.173
What are you doing here?
You look ridiculous!

01:30:37.351 --> 01:30:41.051
We've come to see Flostre. Professor,
Maggie and I need guidance.

01:30:41.188 --> 01:30:43.513
We realize what futile aimless lives we lead.

01:30:43.648 --> 01:30:47.183
- When did you realize this?
- Today. At about two o'clock.

01:30:47.318 --> 01:30:50.319
- Just after lunch.
- Professor, don't believe them!

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:53.067
We want to sit at your feet
and learn.

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:55.903
We sit at your feet,
humble and ignorant, but so willing.

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:57.908
You two just leave his feet alone.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:00.408
Professor, they want to make
a fool of you.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:03.373
- Are you trying to make a fool out of Flostre?
- Who, me?

01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:07.248
You're making things difficult.
You don't own empathicalism.

01:31:07.378 --> 01:31:09.502
It's in the public domain, isn't it?

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:13.213
- Why don't you trust these people?
- Because I know them well.

01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:16.343
I know what they're here for
and it is not guidance.

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.759
Don't listen to her, master.
She is but a child.

01:31:18.889 --> 01:31:20.798
They came to see me, not you.

01:31:20.933 --> 01:31:23.767
To get me over to Duval's
to model their collection.

01:31:25.478 --> 01:31:28.894
- I should have known.
- You should've heard what he said last night!

01:31:29.023 --> 01:31:32.973
If we'd come a few minutes later,
you'd have found out for yourself.

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:34.770
You've said enough, Mr Avery.

01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:37.939
Not yet. I haven't told you
what a phony you are.

01:31:38.073 --> 01:31:41.691
- Get out of my house.
- I'm not ready to leave.

01:31:41.826 --> 01:31:44.068
I think I can change your mind.

01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:46.777
- Catch!
- (Jo screams)

01:31:46.914 --> 01:31:48.705
Oh! Oh, no!

01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:53.290
Look what you've done!
Bursting in here like a hoodlum!

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.745
- I never touched him.
- Go away!

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.667
It's time your waking up
to some of your responsibilities.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.543
Will you please leave?

01:32:00.676 --> 01:32:03.677
Duval can't show his collection
without you, regardless what you feel about me!

01:32:03.804 --> 01:32:06.377
You can't do this to him,
or to all the other people involved!

01:32:06.515 --> 01:32:07.629
Hundreds of people.

01:32:07.849 --> 01:32:10.008
I'm not interested in your people,
than you are in mine!

01:32:10.143 --> 01:32:14.603
- Your empathy is a little one-sided.
- Get out!

01:32:14.731 --> 01:32:15.810
Alright!

01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:18.517
I assume you mean me, too?

01:32:19.318 --> 01:32:21.524
On you it looks cute, sugar.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.781
Well, you certainly fixed everything!

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:32.907
If you can't lick 'em, join 'em
and if you can't join 'em, lick 'em!

01:32:33.039 --> 01:32:35.529
- Tell Duval I'm sorry, we tried.
- Where are you going?

01:32:35.666 --> 01:32:39.200
There's a plane to New York
at 10:30pm and I'm going with it.

01:32:40.045 --> 01:32:42.915
You can't do this to me! Come back!

01:32:43.048 --> 01:32:47.590
How dare you leave me in the street
like this! Taxi!

01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:01.515
- Have they gone?
- They've gone.

01:33:01.648 --> 01:33:04.897
- And you're still here?
- I'm still here.

01:33:05.026 --> 01:33:06.982
Are you alright?

01:33:07.111 --> 01:33:08.273
Well.

01:33:08.987 --> 01:33:12.653
In fact, I feel wonderful.

01:33:14.035 --> 01:33:16.442
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

01:33:16.579 --> 01:33:20.907
I had no idea they were coming,
or what got into Dick.

01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:26.117
My dear, you mustn't assume guilt
for something that was unavoidable.

01:33:27.171 --> 01:33:28.879
They've gone.

01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:34.088
You are here.
That's all that matters now.

01:33:34.219 --> 01:33:37.090
Nice of you to say so,
but if it hadn't been me...

01:33:37.222 --> 01:33:39.926
You have the most penetrating eyes.

01:33:40.058 --> 01:33:42.727
I can still see them
when I close mine.

01:33:42.852 --> 01:33:44.643
- Professor?
- Call me Emile.

01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:47.937
Would there be any value
in my contacting philosophers

01:33:48.065 --> 01:33:51.231
in cities like
Omaha and Detroit and...

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.064
and acquainting them
with empathicalism?

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:57.564
Your mouth suggests to me
burgundy velvet.

01:33:57.699 --> 01:34:02.609
Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in,
has contacts in several universities.

01:34:02.745 --> 01:34:04.536
Please.

01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:09.117
Don't say another word.

01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:12.335
- But I came here to talk.
- We'll talk.

01:34:12.462 --> 01:34:15.830
- Later.
- Why don't I come back later?

01:34:15.965 --> 01:34:17.423
But I need you now.

01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:21.632
Professor Flostre, I came here
to talk with a philosopher.

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:24.335
You're talking like a man.

01:34:24.472 --> 01:34:27.592
But I am a man. And you're a woman.

01:34:27.767 --> 01:34:30.174
That's not what I came
to talk about!

01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:31.770
My dear.

01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:37.857
There is a magical moment
waiting for us.

01:34:37.984 --> 01:34:41.934
- Don't come any closer.
- Why are you behaving like this?

01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:46.780
- I thought you said you come from Greenwich Village?
- I'm moving uptown. Yonkers.

01:34:46.909 --> 01:34:48.533
But before you move...

01:35:02.465 --> 01:35:06.082
I cannot keep them waiting any longer.
I must make an announcement.

01:35:06.218 --> 01:35:09.717
- What shall I say?
- Tell them it was all my fault.

01:35:21.733 --> 01:35:23.476
Maggie, where's Dick?

01:35:23.610 --> 01:35:27.274
You told him to go and he went.
He flies at 10:30pm.

01:35:27.405 --> 01:35:28.567
Oh no, he mustn't!

01:35:28.697 --> 01:35:30.904
I knew you would not let us down!

01:35:31.033 --> 01:35:34.651
- You must do the collection!
- Later. I've got to get to Dick.

01:35:34.786 --> 01:35:37.703
- Later? We are so late already.
- I want to help.

01:35:37.831 --> 01:35:41.116
I know how you feel,
even if you think I don't.

01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:45.912
- I can put myself in your place.
- Maggie, that's empathy!

01:35:46.046 --> 01:35:49.497
That's what you've been talking
about! Why didn't you say?

01:35:49.633 --> 01:35:52.918
Get to work. I'll take care
of Dick. Leave it to me!

01:35:53.053 --> 01:35:55.970
Lettie, what is the name
of Dick Avery's hotel?

01:35:56.097 --> 01:35:58.848
- Le Savoyard.
- Get me the number.

01:35:58.974 --> 01:36:02.177
- Quick, how long before we can begin?
- We're ready.

01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:06.306
Messieurs et mesdames.

01:36:06.439 --> 01:36:09.974
We are proud to bring you
a new collection by Paul Duval,

01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:12.149
inspired by the Quality Woman,

01:36:12.278 --> 01:36:16.738
chosen to represent a great American
fashion magazine, Quality.

01:36:16.865 --> 01:36:19.072
We begin with hors d'oeuvre.

01:36:32.588 --> 01:36:35.873
Hotel Savoyard?
M. Dick Avery, s'il vous plaît?

01:36:41.054 --> 01:36:42.631
(bell rings)

01:36:42.764 --> 01:36:47.674
- Monsieur, your bill is ready.
- I know. 352,428 francs.

01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:50.810
- Merci, monsieur. Come back soon.
- Thank you.

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.847
(woman) He doesn't answer, madame.
I will give you the desk.

01:36:55.984 --> 01:36:57.608
(phone rings)

01:36:57.735 --> 01:37:01.779
Hello. Monsieur Avery?
He just left.

01:37:01.906 --> 01:37:04.443
Well, run out and get him!
It's urgent!

01:37:05.242 --> 01:37:06.440
Oui, madame.

01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:11.946
I'm so sorry. It was too late.

01:37:21.883 --> 01:37:23.507
(applause)

01:37:26.762 --> 01:37:30.759
- Did you get him?
- No. We'll get him at the airport.

01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:33.464
- I can't find the number!
- How are you spelling it?

01:37:33.602 --> 01:37:36.175
- A-U-L-Y.
- Orly. O-R-L-Y.

01:37:36.312 --> 01:37:38.803
- You were there!
- I'm just so nervous.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.932
- Are you ready?
- (Jo) Just about.

01:37:41.067 --> 01:37:43.736
(announcer)
Monsieurs et mesdames, Jonquille.

01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:44.940
(Jo) I'm ready.

01:37:51.534 --> 01:37:54.784
You can board your plane now,
monsieur. Pleasant flight.

01:37:54.912 --> 01:37:55.943
Thanks.

01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:02.331
(loudspeaker)
Attention! Attention!

01:38:02.461 --> 01:38:06.244
Monsieur Avery?
Monsieur Richard Avery?

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:08.338
Maggie, is there any news?

01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:12.594
They promised they'd get my message
to him before he got on the plane.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.759
(clock strikes)

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.133
It's too late.

01:38:16.265 --> 01:38:20.344
The clock must be fast.
He just hasn't got the message yet.

01:38:30.277 --> 01:38:33.860
I'm sure he got it.
He didn't want to talk to me.

01:38:36.533 --> 01:38:39.070
I don't blame him.
I hurt him too much.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.542
And now, the finale
of the collection. Wedding Day.

01:39:02.139 --> 01:39:04.013
What a beautiful bride!

01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:06.180
Yes. Pity it isn't her wedding.

01:39:24.201 --> 01:39:25.446
Professor!

01:39:25.578 --> 01:39:27.404
Keep away from me, you!

01:39:27.538 --> 01:39:30.953
If you lay one finger on me,
I will call your embassy.

01:39:31.082 --> 01:39:34.700
I want to apologize.
She wasn't worth fighting about.

01:39:34.836 --> 01:39:37.587
- Don't tell me I did that!
- You?

01:39:37.713 --> 01:39:40.121
You didn't even give me a headache.

01:39:40.257 --> 01:39:43.957
She did this to me, with a statue
that cost 200,000 francs.

01:39:44.094 --> 01:39:47.545
- She did that?
- I have 18 stitches in my head.

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:50.254
- She gave you 18 stitches?
- And a gashed lip.

01:39:50.391 --> 01:39:52.051
And six stitches in my ear.

01:39:52.185 --> 01:39:55.304
Professor, I love every broken bone
in your body!

01:40:00.776 --> 01:40:03.527
Excuse me, Duval. Where is Jo?

01:40:03.653 --> 01:40:06.322
She was magnificent!
You should've seen her!

01:40:06.447 --> 01:40:09.365
- Where is she?
- I don't know, she was here...

01:40:09.492 --> 01:40:11.568
Lettie! Have you seen Jo?

01:40:11.702 --> 01:40:14.619
No, I...
Oh, Dick, she was just great!

01:40:14.746 --> 01:40:17.154
Maggie, where's Jo?
Have you seen her?

01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:19.366
She was here a while ago,
but she's disappeared.

01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:22.335
- Did she say where she was going?
- I understand now.

01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:25.628
She put herself in your place,
so put yourself in her place.

01:40:25.756 --> 01:40:28.164
You'll meet each other
in somebody's place.

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.217
That's it!
Maggie, you ought to be president.

01:40:31.345 --> 01:40:32.755
I thought I was!
