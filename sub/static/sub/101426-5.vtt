and I will deal with the Dodo stuff.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.160
[groans] Did I ever tell you
that I love you?

29:53.240 --> 29:55.200
Nope. [sighs] Please don't.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.800
[instrumental music on stereo]

30:00.880 --> 30:02.880
[Reza] What was the plan
when you got there?

30:02.960 --> 30:06.520
Casually question Gustav about murder
over champagne and canapes?

30:06.600 --> 30:09.320
I guess I wanted to catch him on the hop
and see how he'd react.

30:09.800 --> 30:10.880
[opening bottles]

30:10.960 --> 30:13.320
Man, how certain are you
of this Gustav thing?

30:13.880 --> 30:17.840
I mean, before, you said he was a target.
Now you're telling me he's part of it.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.440
He's involved, Rez. I can't say how,
but it--

30:20.520 --> 30:23.400
-It was in his eyes.
-[Reza] That's not gonna hold up in court.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.840
Listen, I've been over Gustav's life.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.480
Criminal records, firearm database,
education, business history, the lot.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.960
-Wait, you got access to all that?
-[Kurt] Mm-hm.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.920
-[Reza] And?
-Only stains in his record

30:35.000 --> 30:36.560
are speeding violations

30:36.640 --> 30:39.200
and a six-month suspension
from his boarding school.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.920
What would a Munck have to do
to get excluded from school?

30:43.600 --> 30:46.000
-The right question.
-Well, you want me to ask it?

30:46.680 --> 30:49.160
-If...
-Come on, I can handle a few phone calls.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.080
Bro, I'm bored out my fucking mind here.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.160
Gustav's teachers, his classmates,
other kids from school.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.640
Yeah, well is there anyone else
that would've been around back then?

31:05.120 --> 31:07.120
[suspenseful music plays]

31:18.080 --> 31:18.920
[dog barks]

31:21.560 --> 31:22.880
[dog panting]

31:28.720 --> 31:30.400
You never mentioned who you were.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.320
Neither did you, Detective.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.920
Do you mind if I walk with you?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.320
It's a free country.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.320
Did you enjoy the party?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.080
You getting thrown out was entertaining.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.360
Nice you still attend though,

31:57.080 --> 32:00.560
considering you and Leopold
have been separated for such a long time.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.040
Ooh, have we?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.440
You've lived out here alone
for over 15 years.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.600
Family is family.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.280
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

32:11.640 --> 32:14.640
So I can say I'm not answering you,
and we can go about our days.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.520
Did you leave, or were you pushed away?

32:18.840 --> 32:19.760
I left.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.160
Why?

32:23.480 --> 32:27.080
People change. Leopold and I grew apart.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.800
But you never divorced.

32:30.440 --> 32:34.600
You left just after the time
Gustav was excluded from school.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.520
What was that for?

32:37.320 --> 32:39.880
This is when I say
I'm not answering your question.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.760
[Kurt] You left... when they were boys.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.080
-That must've been hard.
-[sighs] I have always seen my children.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.080
But still.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.520
I mean, normally,
children stay with their mother.

32:53.480 --> 32:58.040
-Being a Munck is <i>not </i>normal.
-Especially true for your boys.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.840
Karl-Axel growing up with the pressure
of being next in line, that's one thing;

33:01.920 --> 33:05.000
Gustav must've felt ignored,
irrelevant even.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.000
What damage would that do to a child?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.000
[Kurt] The <i>fideikommiss.</i>

33:12.960 --> 33:15.920
That's why you left, isn't it?
You thought it was wrong.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.280
The reason Leopold
and I separated is <i>our </i>business.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.200
True.

33:21.280 --> 33:25.280
But a mother isn't parted
from her children without a good reason.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.920
What can you know about motherhood?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.600
I know what it's like
to grow up without one.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.240
I must get back.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.960
I'm sorry about your mother.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.840
[distant voices]

34:14.840 --> 34:15.680
Oh, great.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.320
[Kurt] Nice car.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.280
I hear you had to walk for miles
to get a taxi.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.520
It was a nice stroll.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.200
I'm looking for Mona.

34:26.800 --> 34:27.880
Well, she's not here.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.240
Maybe you should give her a call.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.320
[chuckles] Oh, I get it.
She's not answering.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.360
-I'll tell her you dropped by.
-Thanks.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.160
Hey.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.560
I don't care if you celebrate midsummer's
with the royal family.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.200
I know you're involved, Gustav.
And I'll find out how.

34:47.880 --> 34:48.960
Just so you know.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.320
Go fuck yourself, Detective.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.400
[beep]

35:03.520 --> 35:05.240
[mechanic whirring]

35:11.160 --> 35:12.760
I'll take an Americano, please.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.520
[both chuckle]

35:14.960 --> 35:17.040
-No shit.
-You better watch your back.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.720
-You had your physical?
-Yeah, just passed it.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.120
And Becker,
she put me straight back on duty.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.520
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Well, we had more important things to do.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.240
On that, a wall of silence
on Gustav Munck's school.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.880
Headmaster, teachers,
even the kids in his year.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.720
You know, they remember
so little of Gustav Munck, it's...

35:35.800 --> 35:37.720
almost like
they've been briefed to forget.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.480
-[Kurt] Mm-hm.
-[Reza inhales sharply]

35:39.560 --> 35:43.280
Though I did find out what typically
it would take to be suspended.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.000
An act of violence.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.080
[keyboard clacking]

35:59.480 --> 36:03.480
Hospital records
from... 17 years ago in Sigtuna.

36:04.240 --> 36:08.120
-Someone's down a rabbit hole.
-Can we access the actual medical files,

36:08.200 --> 36:10.000
as in,
what the patients were admitted with?

36:10.080 --> 36:12.560
Yeah. If we have a good reason.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.320
We have a good reason.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.920
What's this list of names?

36:23.000 --> 36:26.080
[Kurt] Uh... pupils who went
to boarding school with Mr. Munck.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.960
Kids go to hospital for lots of reasons.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.920
Hope you've got a way
of narrowing this down.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.320
Gustav was suspended April 14th.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.840
-Let's start with two weeks before that.
-Get you!

36:37.880 --> 36:38.720
Okay.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.160
There's two entries.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.280
One kid with influenza,
not in Gustav's class.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.720
[softly] Shit.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.120
[suspenseful music plays]

37:06.200 --> 37:08.000
Is there a police record of this?

37:09.080 --> 37:11.280
-No.
-The school didn't report it?

37:16.120 --> 37:17.400
This was done by Gustav.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.880
Normally, I'd be inclined to say
you're getting ahead of yourself, but...

37:25.560 --> 37:26.760
look what I found.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.880
-Dodovic walking into a building?
-What's inside?

37:36.080 --> 37:37.640
Eman Dodovic and the Muncks.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.120
Gustav and Dodo
must be in business together.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.560
[Rask] And the plot thickens.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.080
[man] No! Oh, no!

37:52.160 --> 37:54.160
-[laughs]
-[others laugh]

37:55.160 --> 37:59.160
-It was the mansion or the desert.
-[all laughing raucously]

38:09.560 --> 38:10.520
Eman Dodovic.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.600
I do apologize,
but you'll have to excuse me.

38:24.960 --> 38:25.880
[sighs]

38:34.120 --> 38:35.360
[Dodovic clears throat]

38:37.200 --> 38:40.120
I thought we agreed
business hours were off-limits, Josef.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.680
I don't remember agreeing to anything.

38:44.840 --> 38:48.000
You know, your boss
pulled some moves back in the day.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.120
Crazy son of a bitch.

38:50.640 --> 38:54.440
I mean, he wasted years
trying to put me away.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.400
Cost him his family.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.600
But still, we had fun.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.320
Show him the picture.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.960
[Hemberg] Why were you
in a Munck Corporation building?

39:09.040 --> 39:11.320
-Business.
-Who were you meeting?

39:11.400 --> 39:14.400
Why don't you ask the guys
you've had follow me the last few weeks?

39:14.920 --> 39:15.800
They should know.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.760
Look, I'm an upstanding citizen.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.400
I'll throw you a bone.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.880
Contact my lawyer.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.720
He'll tell you why I was there.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.200
[Rask] <i>A shipping contract.</i>

39:47.320 --> 39:49.200
Deal agreed between Munck Corporation

39:49.280 --> 39:51.760
and EMD International,
a company of Eman Dodovic.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.840
They're to handle all of their maritime
import and exports.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.240
Smuggler gets shipping contract.
Sounds like a piss take.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.680
It'd be lucrative enough
for Dodo to truly go straight.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.440
-He could be telling the truth.
-If it's legit, the Munck Corporation

40:05.520 --> 40:07.800
would've had to make an announcement
to shareholders.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.200
-[Rask] Already on it.
-[phone vibrates]

that is where the extra weight,

-Just the truth.

Detective Kurt Wallander.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.040
I'm looking for Tomas Von Rosen.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.640
Well, you've found him.
Uh, what can I do for you, Detective?

41:36.560 --> 41:40.440
Talk to me about something that happened
a long time ago, at boarding school.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.960
Oh-- That?

41:45.920 --> 41:49.280
-Well, it was nothing.
-That's not what your medical report says.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.240
[chuckles]

41:52.320 --> 41:54.480
I take it
you didn't go to boarding school?

41:56.160 --> 41:57.960
It's hard for outsiders to understand,

41:58.040 --> 41:59.280
-but...
-[door chimes]

41:59.360 --> 42:01.360
...this kind of thing happened a lot.
Excuse me.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.520
[Kurt] Wh-Wh-What kind of thing?

42:10.040 --> 42:11.200
There's a hierarchy.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.560
Older boys, uh...

42:14.600 --> 42:16.440
play pranks on the younger ones.

42:16.520 --> 42:17.840
This was no prank.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.720
This was torture.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.600
I'm sorry, I can't talk about it.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.520
Why?

42:25.320 --> 42:26.880
Were you made to sign something?

42:29.240 --> 42:30.320
I'll be right there.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.200
Because I don't want to.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.320
Now please, leave me alone.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.440
We're in the middle of an investigation,

42:37.520 --> 42:39.840
and what you know
could make the difference.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.560
So, please... I understand it's...

42:43.240 --> 42:44.560
difficult to talk about

42:44.640 --> 42:46.160
and painful to go back there.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.200
Yes... it is...

when you've spent a lifetime
trying to forget.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.920
[Kurt] You have a choice.
You can save lives.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.160
More people are suffering like you did.

43:05.640 --> 43:06.480
Fine.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.360

At the beginning, it's the usual stuff.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.560
You know, while you're suffocating.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.720
They stripped me naked...

43:23.840 --> 43:25.520
tied me to a chair with these...

43:26.760 --> 43:27.720
thick ropes...

43:28.760 --> 43:29.880

He had a crowbar...

43:42.800 --> 43:43.640

he said he wanted to see
how far he could go...

43:50.520 --> 43:53.280
without... me dying.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.880
[voice quavering]
And, when I couldn't take it anymore...

44:09.320 --> 44:10.240
he just sat there.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.720
He just sat there...

44:18.320 --> 44:19.360
and watched me...

44:21.080 --> 44:21.960
suffer.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.120
And this person was Gustav Munck?

44:30.040 --> 44:30.880
No...

44:33.720 --> 44:34.800
not Gustav.
