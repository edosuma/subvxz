00:58.224 --> 01:00.267
Emily!

03:02.265 --> 03:04.600
You're the medical examiner?

03:28.416 --> 03:30.459
Mr. Rose?

04:28.309 --> 04:29.643
l'm sorry, Mr. Rose. ..

04:31.813 --> 04:34.273
. ..but l cannot state conclusively...

04:34.440 --> 04:39.403
. ..that the cause of death
was natural.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.864
Your daughter, she. . . .

04:57.171 --> 04:59.214
Excuse me, Father?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.883
Father Moore.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.594
You'll have to come with me.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.565
-Father Moore!
-Will you plead guilty?

05:16.733 --> 05:19.318
-Tell us about the exorcism!
-Over here, Father Moore!

05:19.485 --> 05:22.738
We're at Crescent County Courthouse.
We show you Father Richard Moore. . . .

05:22.905 --> 05:25.574
-What about the parents?
-They're not talking to the police.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.908
Do we charge them?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.286
No. Even the priest admits
he ran the show.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.121
We need a Christian on this.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.539
Preferably a Catholic.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.791
Somebody that knows this shit
inside out. ..

05:34.959 --> 05:37.961
. ..and who the public will see
as unbiased.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.256
We're going after a holy man here.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.092
Ethan Thomas.

05:45.094 --> 05:48.764
He's not Catholic, though.
Methodist, l think.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.434
But the guy practically lives at church.
Choir, teaches Sunday school.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.771
He's no choirboy in the courtroom.
l've seen him tear people up.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.065
He's a shrewd son of a bitch.

06:01.903 --> 06:05.655
All right, pull him off whatever
he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.347
There's ambition. She never stops.
She even works while she drinks.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.557
-Gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner.
-Of course.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.018
-Hello.
-l was so sure Van Hopper would fry...

06:35.186 --> 06:37.979
. ..but you proved me wrong, lady.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.481
The system worked, that's all.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.402
Gentlemen, you'll excuse us,
will you?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.654
Have you seen the news
about this priest?

06:45.822 --> 06:49.491
l heard something about an exorcism
gone bad, but l don't know the details.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.119
The DA charged him
with negligent homicide.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.705
They offered a very reasonable plea
bargain, but the priest turned it down.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.124
Do not ask me to take this--

06:57.291 --> 07:00.544
The archdiocese
specifically requested you.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.339
-Why me?
-They followed the Van Hopper trial.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.174
They think you're smart...

07:06.342 --> 07:07.759
. ..and convincing.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.429
They want you to ask the priest
to reconsider.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.847
Well, what if he won't?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.975
This sounds like a quagmire.
lf l'm smart, l'll leave it alone.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.271
Erin, the Van Hopper case
got you back on the fast track.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.481
Once again, you're a rising star.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.235
-Chivas, neat, please.
-Tanqueray martini, dry.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.780
-What are you saying?
-l'm saying, you do this for me. . .

07:29.198 --> 07:31.992
. ..and the rising star keeps rising.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.410
The case is yours.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.124
And just how high
do l get to rise this time?

07:41.377 --> 07:43.712
l've been junior partner
for too long now, Karl.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.047
-lt's not like other firms haven't called.
-Erin--

07:46.215 --> 07:50.135
l want my name on the door,
right next to yours.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.723
Okay.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.099
Try to get the deal.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.518
lf the priest won't
and this goes to trial...

07:58.686 --> 08:01.188
. ..the archdiocese feels he could
be an embarrassment.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.273
So under no circumstances
is he to testify.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.859
No, of course.
lf l'd put Van Hopper on the stand. . .

08:06.027 --> 08:10.071
. ..he'd be marking time on death row
instead of sunbathing in Miami.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.615
His tab.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.226
Good morning, l'm Erin Bruner.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.852
May l sit down?

08:43.563 --> 08:46.942
They brought the chair
for my public defender.

08:48.402 --> 08:52.906
l guess they left it when they decided
l wasn't going to kill myself with it.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.459
My firm represents the archdiocese.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.462
Yes.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.132
Yes, l was expecting them
to send someone.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.928
-Why did they choose you?
-l wanted this case.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.557
-So you like the spotlight?
-l'm used to it.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.308
l defended James Van Hopper.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.936
And now you've come
to further your celebrity.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.354
No.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.691
l'm here to make senior partner
at my firm.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.488
-Are you a Catholic?
-No.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.992
l'm an agnostic, l guess.
l'm not really sure.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.994
lf you're not sure, then you are one.

09:41.038 --> 09:44.624
l don't think you're the right attorney.
l'll stick with my public defender.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.294
He can't get the DA
to get you a better deal. l can.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.337
l won't be making
any plea agreement.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.798
lf you don't, the archdiocese
won't post your bail.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.050
You'll be stuck in here for the trial.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.222
Do you understand how long
they can put you away?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.640
lt's been explained to me.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.269
The DA's office doesn't like it when
religion holds itself above the law.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.021
And this prosecutor,
Ethan Thomas?

10:06.188 --> 10:09.024
You're gonna need somebody
hungry and smart.. .

10:09.191 --> 10:11.026
. ..and aggressive
to even have a chance.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.738
What would your strategy be to defend
me against such a formidable man?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.365
-That depends.
-On what?

10:17.533 --> 10:18.908
On how you wanna be defended.

10:23.664 --> 10:27.083
What's your main concern,
other than staying out of jail?

10:27.251 --> 10:30.754
-ls it how you're being portrayed?
-l don't care about my reputation.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.797
l'm not afraid of jail.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.678
What l care about
is telling Emily Rose's story.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.307
l want people to hear
what only l can tell.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.184
And what is that?

10:44.352 --> 10:45.935
What really happened to Emily. ..

10:46.103 --> 10:48.063
. ..and why.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.693
lf l let you defend me. . .

10:53.861 --> 10:57.906
. ..will you promise to let me testify and
tell the truth about what happened?

10:58.658 --> 11:03.244
And what is the truth you would tell?
That the ritual killed her?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.914
-Was it your fault she died?
-No.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.166
All right.
Then l'll let you tell her story.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.087
But only if you agree to let me do
whatever else it takes to win.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.942
You're not used to
this kind of place.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.405
l'm sure our life is very strange
to you.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.117
Not so strange.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.787
l grew up in a little town.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.748
But our house wasn't as nice
or as big as this.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.917
My mother, she raised me alone.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.962
She was a schoolteacher,
so we had very little money.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.423
What a wonderful thing to be.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.218
That was Emily's dream,
to be a teacher.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.097
That's why she went away
to the university.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.523
A lot of cats live here.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.152
There are. . .

12:17.319 --> 12:19.988
. .. 1 1 now, l think.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.698
Emily always brought them home.

12:21.866 --> 12:26.703
Ever since she was a little girl,
she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.792
Before these troubles began...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.335
. ..was Emily a happy girl?

12:34.962 --> 12:36.504
Oh, yes.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.924
Before she went away
to university...

12:40.092 --> 12:42.927
. ..my Emily was so very happy.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.932
What is going on--? Girls!

12:51.020 --> 12:52.896
Mama.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.357
ls it--?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.194
lt's a scholarship, Mama.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.364
They pay for it.
They pay for everything.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.825
This is your dream, Emily.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.579
You'll be leaving us.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.707
lt's okay.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.711
l'll be okay.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.839
l'm gonna show this to your father.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.351
-Counselor. Thanks for meeting me.
-Sure.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.730
Can l buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas?
He makes an excellent martini.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.857
Just water for me, please.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.859
So...

13:40.027 --> 13:42.862
. ..the judge thinks we should offer
a new plea agreement.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.200
She feels the community might be
better served without this trial.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.536
How do you feel about it?

13:49.703 --> 13:51.412
Personally.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.457
My job is to represent
the interests of the people.. .

13:54.625 --> 13:56.334
. ..and make an effort to be objective.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.588
l ask because l know
you're a churchgoer.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.590
Now you're set to prosecute
a man of God.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.093
Your priest broke the law. . .

14:05.261 --> 14:07.303
. ..and a young girl is dead.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.432
lf he's a man of God, then, personally,
l think he's even more subject.. .

14:11.600 --> 14:15.270
. ..to the laws of moral behavior.
lf it were up to me, he'd get no deal.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.190
And forgiveness and compassion?
lsn't that part of your creed?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.359
Or does that just get in the way
of your work?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.948
lf you have compassion
for your client. . .

14:27.116 --> 14:29.450
. ..you'll persuade him to accept this:

14:29.618 --> 14:31.953
Charges reduced
to reckless endangerment.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.247
Twelve months in a county jail.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.833
Reducible to six, plus probation,
if he stays out of trouble.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.710
Somehow l expect
he can manage that.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.922
But please understand me.
lf he refuses, l will seek the maximum.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.134
Father Moore has made it clear
there will be no plea agreement.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.137
He will not lie or admit to something
he is not guilty of.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.807
-And he was never neglectful of Emily.
-"Never neglectful"?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.809
Have you seen
the postmortem photographs?

14:59.231 --> 15:02.984
We'll go to trial. My client wants
the public to know the truth.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.445
Good.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.364
So do l.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.118
Have a good night, counselor.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.149
Let the record show that the defendant
and his counsel are present. . .

16:25.317 --> 16:27.026
. ..and that the jury is seated.

16:27.569 --> 16:31.364
-Mr. Thomas, you may begin.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.617
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Ethan Thomas.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.246
l'm the assistant district attorney,
and l represent the people.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.832
ln the case before you,
the evidence will show...

16:41.000 --> 16:45.712
. ..that the victim had a serious medical
condition that demanded treatment.

16:45.879 --> 16:50.091
We will prove that the victim's
condition rendered her physically. . .

16:50.259 --> 16:55.263
. ..and psychologically incapable
of caring for herself.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.973
Her care...

16:57.141 --> 16:58.891
. ..was then wholly entrusted.. .

16:59.393 --> 17:03.271
. ..to that man, the defendant,
Father Richard Moore.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.065
She became his responsibility...

17:07.026 --> 17:09.902
. ..and he betrayed
that responsibility...

17:10.069 --> 17:12.613
. ..by persuading her to abandon
her medical treatment...

17:12.781 --> 17:15.282
. ..in favor of religious treatment:

17:15.992 --> 17:19.619
A ritual exorcism,
performed by the defendant. . .

17:19.788 --> 17:24.791
. ..allegedly to cure the victim
by ridding her of demonic forces.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.088
We will demonstrate
that this course of action. . .

17:29.256 --> 17:32.216
. ..directly resulted
in the victim's death.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.344
l said a moment ago
that l represent the people.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.598
We all know what that means,
but it's a little abstract, isn't it?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.309
Miss Bruner,
the attorney for the defense. . .

17:41.477 --> 17:44.312
. ..is seated right next
to the man she represents.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.815
And l stand here
to represent the people.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.277
That's not really why
l stand here today.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.990
l'm here on behalf of someone
who can't sit at a table. . .

17:57.159 --> 18:00.411
. ..and look at you every day
and gain your sympathy...

18:01.038 --> 18:03.831
. ..someone who can't take the stand
to testify...

18:03.999 --> 18:07.335
. ..and tell you what happened
in her own words.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.172
A young girl. . .

18:11.340 --> 18:13.299
. ..that could've been your daughter.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.802
Could've been mine.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.889
A girl who trusted
Father Richard Moore with her life.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.106
This is what she looked like. . .

18:31.360 --> 18:35.696
. ..before the defendant began
his religious treatment.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.244
This is a photograph taken of her
on the day that she died.

18:56.051 --> 19:00.888
l stand here for Emily Rose.. .

19:02.182 --> 19:04.892
. ..who died horribly...

19:05.060 --> 19:07.979
. ..at age 1 9.

19:09.731 --> 19:13.401
You won't be able to see Emily sitting
here day after day during this trial.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.654
But l hope you'll remember her
as she was when she was alive. . .

19:18.490 --> 19:20.032
. ..and full of. . .

19:21.410 --> 19:24.245
. ..hopes and dreams.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.084
And as she was when Father
Richard Moore was finished with her...

19:31.336 --> 19:32.879
. ..and left her to die.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.884
Thank you.

19:38.802 --> 19:42.096
ls the defense prepared
to make its opening statement?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.101
l'd like to reserve
my opening statement...

19:47.269 --> 19:49.562
. ..until the presentation
of the defense's case.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.522
As is your privilege.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.400
Prosecution may begin.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.068
That was already my plan.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.779
Thank you, Your Honor.
The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.

19:58.947 --> 20:03.701
l've known Emily her entire life.
l took care of all of the Rose girls.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.954
Can you describe Emily
as you knew her growing up?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.457
She was a bit sickly
in her early years.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.295
She stayed inside a lot,
reading, learning music.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.464
How did she feel about
going to school?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.633
Objection.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.969
l'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily
about going off to college?

20:22.137 --> 20:24.680
Yes. She told me she was excited. . .

20:24.848 --> 20:29.352
. ..but nervous that she would be away
from her family in the big city.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.562
This was an overwhelming change
for her.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.606
Did you stay in touch
after she went away?

20:33.774 --> 20:39.195
Yes. She wrote me a letter
saying that she'd been to a dance...

20:39.363 --> 20:41.447
. ..and she'd met a boy
named Jason.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.699
She didn't want her mother
to know this. . .

20:43.867 --> 20:46.410
. ..because her mother did not
approve of dancing. . .

20:46.578 --> 20:48.663
. ..and had warned her
about the boys at school.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.625
Did Emily communicate with you again
last fall after you received the letter?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.418
Actually, it was her mother.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.506
She telephoned me. . .

20:58.674 --> 21:01.342
. ..waking me out of a deep sleep
at 4 in the morning.

21:02.761 --> 21:07.139
She asked me to call Emily at
a payphone on the university campus.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.229
When Emily answered,
she was quite hysterical.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.858
At first, she just
sobbed uncontrollably.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.071
But eventually she calmed down
enough to tell me what happened.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.534
She said that she was alone
that weekend.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.287
Her roommate had gone home.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.376
She had awakened...

21:36.295 --> 21:39.297
...and thought she smelled
something burning.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.925
There was no alarm,
but she got up...

21:43.719 --> 21:45.886
...afraid there was a fire.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.073
Dr. Mueller, what's your position
at the university hospital?

24:53.241 --> 24:55.910
l am chairman of
the Department of Neurology.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.370
And after you heard
about the dorm-room incident. ..

24:58.538 --> 25:00.122
. ..what were your initial thoughts?

25:00.290 --> 25:03.417
At first, l thought perhaps
Emily had taken illegal drugs.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.419
Some type of hallucinogen.

25:05.587 --> 25:09.465
But we ran tests and found no trace
of drugs in her system.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.926
And the more she explained
the incident to me...

25:12.093 --> 25:15.304
. ..the more l began to suspect
something else.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.975
Epilepsy results from uncontrolled
electrical activity in the brain.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.895
ln a severe, or grand mal, seizure...

25:23.063 --> 25:25.606
...a person may lose consciousness
for several minutes...

25:25.774 --> 25:29.109
...and suffer involuntary contractions
of all the muscles of the body.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.737
ls it possible for a person
suffering such a seizure...

25:31.905 --> 25:35.241
...to have hallucinations or perceive
the things that Emily described?

25:35.408 --> 25:38.953
The muscle contractions could feel
like an extreme pressure on the body.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.956
And it is certainly possible,
with all that brain activity...

25:42.123 --> 25:46.418
. ..for a person to perceive all sorts
of strange and violent things.

25:46.836 --> 25:50.130
So suspecting that Emily was
epileptic, how did you proceed?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.550
l administered
an electroencephalograph.

25:52.717 --> 25:53.968
What did the EEG reveal?

25:54.135 --> 25:58.597
lt showed a possible epileptic focus
in the patient's left temporal lobe.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.558
Did this require a specific treatment?

26:00.725 --> 26:03.894
Yes, l began a medication schedule
for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.

26:04.062 --> 26:08.148
l also advised regular follow-up
examinations and further tests.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.318
But Emily failed to keep
her follow-up appointments with me.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.572
She give any reason for discontinuing
these appointments?

26:14.739 --> 26:18.450
Yes, she told me she was convinced
that her condition was a spiritual one.

26:18.618 --> 26:22.913
lt was the conviction of her priest,
she said, and she shared his beliefs.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.666
Was it your impression
that Emily had placed her care. ..

26:25.834 --> 26:27.751
-. . .entirely--?
-Leading the witness.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.378
Sustained.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.549
After the end of October...

26:33.717 --> 26:36.051
. ..did you ask Emily
why she had stopped. . .

26:36.219 --> 26:37.928
. ..filling her Gambutrol
prescriptions?

26:38.096 --> 26:42.516
Yes. She said that Father Moore had
suggested she stop taking the drug.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.351
And what, in your medical opinion. . .

26:44.519 --> 26:46.770
. ..was the result
of Father Moore's suggestion?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.106
l believe Father Moore's suggestion
killed her.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.691
Objection, Your Honor!

26:50.859 --> 26:54.194
The witness is asserting outrageous
conclusions based on pure hearsay.

26:54.863 --> 26:59.533
Technically correct, but l'll allow it
as part of his expert opinion testimony.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.452
Thank you, Dr. Mueller.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.870
Your witness.

27:03.038 --> 27:08.042
You said you observed a possible
epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.879
Doesn't this imply what you observed
may not have been an epileptic focus?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.672
Yes, that's also possible.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.009
Would Father Moore's advice to stop
taking Gambutrol be good advice. . .

27:17.177 --> 27:19.094
. ..if Emily were, in fact,
not epileptic?

27:19.304 --> 27:22.473
Of course. But that's not
the case here. She was epileptic.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.183
Really.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.978
When Emily saw objects move
on their own.. .

27:28.146 --> 27:30.981
. ..and felt an invisible presence
on top of her...

27:31.149 --> 27:33.692
. ..was she experiencing symptoms
typical of epilepsy?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.069
Not typical, no.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.905
Are they typical indications
of any other conditions?

27:38.073 --> 27:41.200
-Say, for example, psychosis?
-Yes, l would say that's correct.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.913
But isn't psychosis an entirely different
medical condition from epilepsy?

27:46.956 --> 27:49.249
-Yes, in my--
-So aren't you selectively choosing.. .

27:49.417 --> 27:52.419
. ..what parts of Emily's experiences
fit your epilepsy diagnosis...

27:52.587 --> 27:54.922
. ..while ignoring those which
indicate something else?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.424
-Objection. Argumentative.
-Withdrawn.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.219
No further questions.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.045
We have to work fast.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.589
They're only giving me an hour
with you tonight.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.384
Listen.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.637
Before we get started,
there's something l have to tell you. . .

28:43.805 --> 28:46.974
. ..something l should've said to you
before l let you take the case.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.475
Okay.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.773
There are forces
surrounding this trial.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.652
Dark, powerful forces.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.323
Just be careful, Erin.
Watch your step.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.410
l see.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.997
Look--

29:10.999 --> 29:13.459
Father, you don't have to worry
about me.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.085
l'm an agnostic, remember?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.838
Demons exist,
whether you believe in them or not.

29:18.173 --> 29:22.426
Your involvement in this trial might
just open you up to their attacks.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.555
Look, Father,
l appreciate your concern...

29:26.723 --> 29:29.016
. ..but you need to be worried
about yourself.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.519
Ethan Thomas is using the medical
aspects of this case as ammunition. . .

29:32.687 --> 29:36.523
. ..and l have to be prepared
for his attacks, so. ..

29:36.691 --> 29:42.446
. ..with what little time we have, l think
we need to focus on your defense.

29:54.042 --> 29:58.212
Now, what l need from you is more
information about Emily's condition.

29:58.379 --> 30:02.424
Specific details of how it progressed
after the dorm-room episode.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.718
Well, after the first incident. . .

30:04.886 --> 30:10.808
. ..she was sent to the university
hospital for testing and observation.

30:46.761 --> 30:50.722
Emily once told me that in her
dorm room, she resisted the demons...

30:50.890 --> 30:53.725
. ..but at the hospital
they overcame her.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.561
So she believed. . .

30:55.728 --> 30:57.896
. ..that her possession
began at the hospital?

30:58.940 --> 31:01.942
Yeah, l think she did.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.112
And after that, things just went
from bad to worse.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.153
Emily!

33:49.444 --> 33:50.861
Emily?

34:21.391 --> 34:23.435
Oh, my God. Emily?

34:24.937 --> 34:27.481
Don't touch me.

34:34.112 --> 34:37.239
Jason, please. . .

34:38.242 --> 34:40.659
. ..don't leave me.

34:48.002 --> 34:50.545
And l never did leave her.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.339
I stayed until the end.

34:54.300 --> 34:58.220
So much of what we shared
was like a nightmare. . .

34:58.387 --> 35:01.348
. ..but l wouldn't give up
a single minute l spent with her.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.019
She woke me up, you know?

35:06.187 --> 35:10.690
To things l never felt before,
things l never knew l could feel.

35:12.735 --> 35:16.196
l never knew how dead l was
until l met her.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.537
--residential north metro district
where James Van Hopper...

35:23.704 --> 35:25.997
...acquitted after
a controversial trial...

35:26.165 --> 35:28.959
-Can you turn that up, please?
-...has apparently struck again.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.002
lt was inside
this quiet suburban home...

35:31.170 --> 35:34.798
...that police say James Van Hopper
murdered a young couple today.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.717
Sources close to the investigation
say that Van Hopper...

35:37.885 --> 35:40.137
...who was acquitted
of murder charges in April...

35:40.304 --> 35:42.264
...may have known
both of the victims.

35:42.431 --> 35:46.434
Their names are being withheld
pending family notification.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.475
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly army. . .

40:37.643 --> 40:39.602
. ..holy Michael, the archangel. ..

40:39.770 --> 40:42.063
. ..defend us in battle
against the princes...

40:42.231 --> 40:44.691
. ..powers and rulers of darkness.

41:05.004 --> 41:09.174
Counsel Bruner, my courtroom day
begins at 9:30 a.m.

41:09.341 --> 41:13.303
-l'm sorry, Your Honor, l--
-Which was 1 7 minutes ago.

41:15.347 --> 41:16.890
Ready to proceed?

41:18.017 --> 41:19.392
Yes, Your Honor.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.187
Dr. Briggs, please state
your qualifications for the court.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.564
l have advanced degrees
in medicine...

41:24.732 --> 41:27.650
. ..psychiatry and neurology
from Johns Hopkins. . .

41:27.818 --> 41:31.946
. ..and l have had three books
and several dozen papers published.. .

41:32.114 --> 41:35.033
. ..in the fields of neurology
and neuropsychiatry.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.244
What was the cause of death,
as determined by the autopsy?

41:38.412 --> 41:42.790
The decedent expired due to a gradual
shutdown of the bodily functions.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.876
Why did her body shut down?

41:45.044 --> 41:48.004
The autopsy found
that it was a cumulative effect...

41:48.172 --> 41:51.841
. ..from numerous physical traumas
exacerbated by malnutrition. ..

41:52.009 --> 41:56.930
. ..which severely inhibited her ability
to recuperate from those traumas.

41:57.097 --> 42:01.559
ln other words, her starving body
had little or no means to recover. . .

42:01.727 --> 42:05.688
. ..from the injuries it was sustaining,
and so it eventually just gave out.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.524
How did Emily get these injuries?

42:07.691 --> 42:10.527
Some were the result
of violent epileptic seizures. . .

42:10.694 --> 42:12.362
. ..and some were self-inflicted.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.281
And why, in your opinion,
did Emily injure herself...

42:15.449 --> 42:16.908
. ..and why did she stop eating?

42:17.076 --> 42:20.286
Upon review
of her complete medical file. . .

42:20.454 --> 42:22.956
. .. l concluded that Emily's epilepsy
had evolved. ..

42:23.123 --> 42:26.626
. ..into a condition known as
psychotic epileptic disorder.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.628
This is a rare development,
to be sure. . .

42:28.796 --> 42:31.172
. ..but one that l have witnessed
numerous times.

42:31.340 --> 42:35.134
-Emily was epileptic and psychotic?
-Yes.

42:35.302 --> 42:38.805
Explain how this psychotic epileptic
disorder would manifest itself.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.808
The seizures would have
the symptoms of schizophrenia. . .

42:41.976 --> 42:45.395
...such as auditory
and visual hallucinations...

42:46.063 --> 42:48.064
...and sometimes extreme paranoia.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.484
The seizures may lock up the joints
and slightly contort the body.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.696
The pupils will dilate,
making the eyes appear black.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.698
So you believe
that Emily had epilepsy...

42:56.865 --> 42:59.659
. ..which developed into
a form of violent psychosis...

42:59.827 --> 43:02.161
. ..a condition that can be controlled
with Gambutrol?

43:02.329 --> 43:05.832
Yes. And it would've been,
if she'd continued her treatment.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.793
ln your opinion, if Emily
had continued with her medication...

43:08.961 --> 43:11.462
-. . .would she be alive today?
-Absolutely.

43:11.630 --> 43:17.010
lf treated early, psychotic epileptic
disorder is rarely fatal.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.845
l mean, this--

43:19.013 --> 43:22.348
This was a very sick girl.

43:22.683 --> 43:25.226
The defendant should've realized
that Emily was in need. ..

43:25.394 --> 43:28.146
. ..of continued medical treatment.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.983
Thank you, doctor. Your witness.

43:34.903 --> 43:38.948
Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol
could've controlled Emily's condition.

43:39.658 --> 43:40.867
How do you know that?

43:41.035 --> 43:44.662
lt's the inevitable result
of taking the drug.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.706
lt would've controlled
her seizures. . .

43:46.874 --> 43:48.916
. ..which were the root cause
of her psychosis.

43:49.084 --> 43:52.045
But wasn't Emily still experiencing
psychotic symptoms. ..

43:52.212 --> 43:54.380
. ..even after she started
taking the medication?

43:54.548 --> 43:57.425
Yes. Because Gambutrol
has a cumulative effect.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.719
lt takes time to build up
in the system.

43:59.887 --> 44:03.264
You assume that Gambutrol would've
helped her, but you don't know.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.725
lt's a reasonable assumption, but. ...

44:06.226 --> 44:07.810
No, of course, l can't be certain.

44:09.396 --> 44:14.776
Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic
disorder" a common medical term...

44:14.943 --> 44:16.569
. ..or did you just make it up?

44:17.321 --> 44:19.822
Well, l distinguished
and named the--

44:19.990 --> 44:23.409
So psychotic epileptic disorder
is really your own pet theory?

44:23.577 --> 44:25.244
-Objection. Argumentative.
-Sustained.

44:25.412 --> 44:29.374
When Emily chose
to stop her medical treatment.. .

44:29.541 --> 44:31.584
. ..what do you think
should've been done?

44:31.752 --> 44:33.503
Upon recognizing her condition...

44:33.671 --> 44:36.881
. .. l would have tranquilized her
and force-fed her.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.383
And then, if necessary.. .

44:38.550 --> 44:41.094
. .. l would've treated her
with electroconvulsive therapy.

44:41.261 --> 44:44.180
Electroshock treatment. You would've
done this against her will?

44:46.016 --> 44:47.392
To save her life?

44:50.437 --> 44:52.271
Absolutely.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.532
Nothing further.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.870
The witness may step down.

45:09.206 --> 45:12.959
Your Honor, l offer into evidence this
photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.794
And having done so, the people rest.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.921
The photograph is entered
into evidence.

45:17.089 --> 45:22.051
We are recessed until
tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp...

45:22.219 --> 45:25.138
. ..at which time the defense
will give its opening statement...

45:25.305 --> 45:26.973
. ..and call its first witness.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.309
l'm sorry l was late.

45:30.477 --> 45:33.980
l didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power
outage knocked out my alarm clock.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.482
-lt won't happen again.
-No, l didn't sleep either.

45:37.151 --> 45:38.484
What kept you awake?

45:39.570 --> 45:41.028
Doesn't matter.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.782
You're under attack.

45:46.368 --> 45:47.952
What are you talking about?

45:48.829 --> 45:51.247
You're in a spiritual battle, Erin.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.625
The forces of darkness are trying
to keep you away from the light.

45:56.211 --> 45:57.712
Don't let them.

45:59.047 --> 46:02.091
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.

46:03.302 --> 46:06.345
We're getting creamed.
l can't believe l walked right into that.

46:06.513 --> 46:09.724
Look, if we don't find a doctor
to testify that Emily. ..

46:09.892 --> 46:15.188
. ..wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic
or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.

46:23.489 --> 46:26.532
Care of the city's main branch
and the university library...

46:26.700 --> 46:28.910
. .. l bring you another dozen
fun-filled books. ..

46:29.077 --> 46:32.497
. ..about the demonic
and the mentally deranged.

46:33.832 --> 46:35.374
They burned women at the stake...

46:35.542 --> 46:37.668
. ..during witch hunts
for being possessed.

46:37.836 --> 46:39.670
Glad you don't have to defend
those guys.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.256
-How are we on our medical experts?
-Not good.

46:42.424 --> 46:45.676
The psychiatrist you wanted
is tied up in another trial.

46:45.844 --> 46:49.764
And the neurologist is sailing
to Costa Rica.

46:50.015 --> 46:52.225
This book l'm reading,
it's by an anthropologist.

46:53.227 --> 46:56.562
lt's about contemporary cases of
possession, mostly in the Third World.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.023
People there are still
primitive and superstitious.

46:59.191 --> 47:00.566
Maybe.

47:00.734 --> 47:03.402
Maybe they see possession
for what it really is.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.488
Maybe we've taught ourselves
not to see it.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.659
-You saying you believe in this stuff?
-No.

47:09.827 --> 47:13.162
Maybe we shouldn't just try
to invalidate the prosecution's case...

47:13.330 --> 47:15.915
. ..by punching holes
in the medical approach.

47:16.083 --> 47:20.586
Maybe we should also try
to validate the alternative.

47:24.132 --> 47:28.094
-Validate possession in a court of law?
-Yes.

47:30.222 --> 47:34.225
Okay. l guess we could bring in
some priests to talk about exorcisms--

47:34.393 --> 47:36.644
No, the archdiocese
won't let us do that.

47:36.812 --> 47:40.189
They wanna limit the Church's
exposure to Father Moore.

47:40.357 --> 47:43.276
l've got three articles by the
anthropologist who wrote this book.

47:43.443 --> 47:45.444
She approaches
the subject of possession. . .

47:45.612 --> 47:49.073
. ..from a scientific perspective
and doesn't try to debunk it.

47:49.241 --> 47:52.076
-You want me to track her down?
-Yeah.

47:53.287 --> 47:56.455
Keep looking for a medical expert
to refute Dr. Briggs.

47:56.623 --> 47:59.417
But send the case file
to this Dr. Sadira Adani.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.337
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

48:03.505 --> 48:06.132
. ..as you know by now,
my name is Erin Bruner...

48:06.300 --> 48:08.467
. ..and l represent the defendant,
Richard Moore.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.763
Mr. Thomas has contended
that Emily Rose suffered...

48:12.931 --> 48:14.891
. ..from a serious medical condition. ..

48:15.058 --> 48:18.477
. ..that required medical treatment,
nothing more.

48:18.645 --> 48:21.355
He has asserted that any attempt
by my client. . .

48:21.523 --> 48:24.650
. ..to help Emily by anything
other than medical means...

48:24.818 --> 48:28.654
. ..was not only inappropriate,
but criminally negligent.

48:30.157 --> 48:32.909
l'm now gonna ask
that you keep an open mind. . .

48:33.076 --> 48:36.370
. ..to what our evidence
and testimony will show.

48:36.538 --> 48:39.498
Medical treatment was not
the answer for Emily...

48:39.666 --> 48:43.336
. ..because she simply did not suffer
from a medical condition.

48:43.503 --> 48:48.049
She was neither epileptic
nor psychotic.

48:50.844 --> 48:54.513
Emily Rose's condition, in fact,
was demonic possession.

48:54.681 --> 48:58.184
An exorcism was her only hope
for a cure.

48:58.352 --> 49:02.355
Some of you may find yourself unable
to reconcile Emily's beliefs...

49:02.522 --> 49:04.857
. ..or those of the defendant
with your own.

49:05.025 --> 49:09.195
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.

49:09.655 --> 49:13.199
Because you will see that after the
utter failure of doctors to help Emily...

49:13.951 --> 49:17.411
. ..Father Moore simply tried
to help Emily in a different way...

49:17.579 --> 49:23.167
. ..using an approach that he,
Emily and her family firmly believed...

49:23.335 --> 49:25.544
. ..was her only chance for relief.

49:25.712 --> 49:28.381
And we will show that
despite his greatest efforts...

49:28.548 --> 49:30.716
. ..and his sincere love for Emily. . .

49:32.219 --> 49:37.056
...there was nothing he could've done
to prevent the death of Emily Rose.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.228
Are you okay?

49:43.563 --> 49:45.064
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

50:18.515 --> 50:22.852
She said it was terrible to hear
the clinking of spoons and forks.

50:23.311 --> 50:26.188
She was always hungry,
but she said they wouldn't let her eat.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.608
Who did she mean by "they"?

50:30.527 --> 50:33.446
The forces that were
in control of her.

50:33.613 --> 50:35.948
That were inside her.

50:37.492 --> 50:39.035
You know, the demons.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.289
Tell us what else happened
that night.

50:47.294 --> 50:49.795
l walked her back to her dorm...

50:50.422 --> 50:53.215
. ..and she seemed really nervous
and scared.

50:53.383 --> 50:57.219
So l held her for a while,
trying to calm her down.

50:57.387 --> 51:02.892
l fell asleep, but when l woke up,
she wasn't beside me.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.490
Emily?

51:29.669 --> 51:31.212
Hey.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.259
Can you hear me?

51:49.231 --> 51:51.857
l called her father, and he told me
to bring Emily home.

51:54.444 --> 51:56.737
Jason and l put Emily to bed...

51:56.905 --> 51:59.115
...hoping she would sleep.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.283
And when did Father Moore
become involved?

52:03.078 --> 52:05.162
Emily stayed home after that.

52:05.330 --> 52:09.458
She didn't return to school,
and she kept getting worse.

52:09.626 --> 52:14.296
Eventually, when she didn't get better,
we called our priest, Father Moore.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.716
When he arrived,
l sent my daughter Alice upstairs...

52:17.884 --> 52:20.261
...to see if Emily was awake.

52:29.729 --> 52:31.063
Emily?

52:34.276 --> 52:36.235
Can l come in?

52:50.375 --> 52:53.544
-Our Father, who art in heaven--
-Emily?

52:57.883 --> 53:00.593
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs?

53:00.760 --> 53:02.970
--as it is in heaven.

53:03.138 --> 53:06.557
Give us this day our daily bread. . . .

53:55.232 --> 53:56.523
Emily, can you hear me?

54:12.624 --> 54:13.999
Let's get her off the floor.

54:15.335 --> 54:16.502
Alice, no!

54:29.432 --> 54:32.518
l am the one who dwells within.

54:34.688 --> 54:38.816
And l am the one who comes
in His name.

54:40.694 --> 54:44.405
Think you can force me out, priest?

54:45.573 --> 54:46.782
Try.

54:48.994 --> 54:50.661
l dare you.

55:52.390 --> 55:55.601
You've suffered a terrible loss,
Mr. Rose. l know this is difficult.

55:55.769 --> 55:58.145
So thank you for being here today.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.855
Sir, do you often read the Bible?

56:00.023 --> 56:01.815
-Yes, l do.
-So do l .

56:03.276 --> 56:04.610
What about the DSM?

56:04.778 --> 56:07.654
The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders...

56:07.822 --> 56:10.949
. ..commonly referred to
as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

56:11.117 --> 56:12.618
-Have you read that?
-No.

56:12.786 --> 56:15.079
So you're not aware
that according to the DSM. ..

56:15.246 --> 56:19.458
. ..a person's refusal to eat is
a common indication of anorexia?

56:19.626 --> 56:23.087
Objection. The witness just said
he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor.

56:23.254 --> 56:25.589
-Sustained.
-Mr. Rose. . .

56:26.132 --> 56:28.342
. ..are you aware
that catatonic rigidity...

56:28.510 --> 56:30.928
. ..specifically a locking up
of the body's joints.. .

56:31.096 --> 56:32.805
. ..is a known symptom of psychosis?

56:32.972 --> 56:35.307
No. l haven't studied these things.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.643
Have you ever visited
an insane asylum. . .

56:37.977 --> 56:40.104
. ..or a hospital for the mentally ill?

56:40.814 --> 56:43.649
Once. My aunt was in one
before she died.

56:43.817 --> 56:46.944
Really? So there's a history
of mental illness in your family?

56:47.445 --> 56:48.987
l suppose.

56:49.155 --> 56:52.032
Sir, if you saw someone
eating insects...

56:52.492 --> 56:56.745
. ..on a street corner, would you say
that that person is mentally ill?

56:56.913 --> 56:59.456
-Probably, yes.
-So can you say with confidence. . .

56:59.624 --> 57:02.209
. ..that the behavior you saw
in your daughter's bedroom. . .

57:02.377 --> 57:05.337
. ..could not be the behavior of
someone suffering from psychosis?

57:05.505 --> 57:09.341
l don't know. She never had
any problems like that before.

57:09.926 --> 57:13.846
lt just didn't feel that way to me
or to Father Moore.

57:15.181 --> 57:17.057
-And you trusted him, right?
-Yes.

57:17.225 --> 57:18.934
He is our parish priest.

57:19.102 --> 57:22.354
Fair enough. And after that night,
would you say that you. . .

57:22.522 --> 57:25.065
. ..put your daughter entirely
in Father Moore's care?

57:25.233 --> 57:27.818
Yes. We had done all we could.

57:27.986 --> 57:30.320
We said she was in his hands now. ..

57:30.780 --> 57:32.698
. ..body and soul.

57:33.783 --> 57:36.785
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

57:36.953 --> 57:38.954
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
You may step down.

57:41.207 --> 57:44.001
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.

57:44.169 --> 57:48.380
l am currently a professor
of anthropology and psychiatry...

57:48.548 --> 57:50.674
. ..at Northwestern University.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.551
Where did you receive
your education?

57:52.719 --> 57:54.928
At Yale, and then at Cambridge.

57:55.096 --> 57:57.556
And what is your specific area
of expertise?

57:57.724 --> 58:02.060
l study the spiritual experiences
of people in various cultures. . .

58:02.228 --> 58:05.564
. ..and the physiological
and psychological changes...

58:05.732 --> 58:09.109
. ..they undergo
during these experiences.

58:09.277 --> 58:13.322
Would it be accurate to say that you
specialize in the study of possession?

58:13.490 --> 58:18.535
Yes. "Possession" is one term
for a basic human experience. . .

58:18.703 --> 58:23.540
. ..reported by a great number
of people all around the world.

58:23.708 --> 58:27.753
ln my fieldwork, l've seen
many people who experienced...

58:27.921 --> 58:32.716
. ..a sense of being invaded by
an entity from the supernatural realm.

58:32.884 --> 58:34.843
Why do you think
Emily was invaded?

58:35.011 --> 58:37.304
Why did this possession
happen to her?

58:37.472 --> 58:39.932
Based on my study of the case file. . .

58:40.099 --> 58:44.228
. .. l believe that Emily Rose
was a hypersensitive.

58:44.395 --> 58:46.897
A person with
an unusual connection. . .

58:47.065 --> 58:50.901
. ..to what Carlos Castaneda called
"the separate reality."

58:51.444 --> 58:56.073
Hypersensitives are born
different from everyone else.

58:56.241 --> 59:00.118
They can have visions of the future,
or see the dead. . .

59:00.286 --> 59:03.539
. ..and sometimes be
uniquely susceptible...

59:03.706 --> 59:06.750
. ..to invasion by an entity
that is alien to them.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.085
Objection.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.463
On what grounds?

59:11.631 --> 59:13.507
How about silliness, Your Honor?

59:13.675 --> 59:15.425
A young girl
suffered terribly and died.

59:15.593 --> 59:19.137
Do we have to subject her illness
to this pseudoscientific analysis?

59:19.305 --> 59:22.224
Both counselors,
please approach the bench.

59:22.600 --> 59:25.185
Your Honor, this testimony
is beyond ridiculous. Visions--

59:25.353 --> 59:28.564
Supernatural belief systems
are shared by millions of people.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.148
We're in The Twilight Zone here.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.734
Her expertise is relevant
to the issues in this case.

59:32.902 --> 59:35.028
Let's have a witch doctor
sift through bones--

59:35.196 --> 59:36.655
Stop.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.952
We've heard a great deal
of testimony. . .

59:42.120 --> 59:46.206
. ..in support of a medical explanation
for Emily's condition.

59:46.374 --> 59:48.500
Now we have a witness
who has spent her career. . .

59:48.668 --> 59:51.962
. ..studying the defense's
alternative explanation.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.172
An exorcism expert, if you will.

59:55.466 --> 59:57.759
l think we'll hear
what she has to say.

59:57.927 --> 59:59.219
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:06.101
Dr. Adani, why do you think
Emily's exorcism failed?

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:11.523
The medical treatment.
Specifically, the drug Gambutrol.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.150
Please explain.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:17.738
The exorcism ritual results
in a specific brain activity.. .

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:21.700
. ..that cuts the person off from
the possession experience.

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:26.705
But Emily's exorcism
could not have achieved this. . .

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.583
. ..because the doctor
gave her Gambutrol. . .

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.670
. ..which has an intoxicating effect
on the brain.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:37.799
The drug made her immune
to the psycho-spiritual shock. . .

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.927
. ..that exorcism
is intended to provide.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:45.098
What do you believe was the result of
treatment with this intoxicating drug?

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:49.019
Gambutrol locked Emily
in the possessed state.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:52.564
This left her unable to respond
to the exorcism. . .

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:57.027
. ..and therefore, it directly
contributed to her death.

01:00:58.404 --> 01:00:59.655
Thank you, doctor.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.241
No further questions.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.250
l'm looking at a list of
your published articles, doctor.

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:14.586
You've been quite busy and prolific.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:18.423
So based on your time spent
with Holy Roller snake-handlers. . .

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:22.678
. ..voodoo priestesses
and lndians tripping on peyote buds.. .

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:26.723
. ..based on observing
these bizarre individuals. ..

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:28.934
. ..you've concluded
that possession is...

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.686
. ..a basic, typical
human experience?

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.396
l must say, counselor.. .

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:35.232
. ..that's quite a laundry list
of disdain. ..

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.944
. ..and one that thoroughly
mischaracterizes my research.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:43.865
No, l don't think possession
is a typical experience.

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:48.745
But l am convinced that it is
a scientifically verified. . .

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:50.789
. ..culturally universal one.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.333
Have you ever used Gambutrol
in your studies. . .

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:56.962
. ..to test your theory about its effect
on the possession experience?

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:00.757
Absolutely not. That would be
dangerous to the patient.

01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:04.636
So this notion of Gambutrol locking
someone in a possessed state...

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:08.140
. ..the key to your assertion that
her medical treatment harmed Emily. . .

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:10.475
. ..this would be your own
pet theory, correct?

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:13.311
-You're just making this one up?
-Objection. Argumentative.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:14.771
Sustained.

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:18.525
Although l think he's just taking
a page from your book, counselor.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.237
No further questions.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.914
Erin!

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:35.292
l've got a doctor
who wants to testify.

01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:37.502
He's an eyewitness, Erin.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:39.504
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:41.047
-What?
-He called us.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:44.426
Dr. Graham Cartwright,
Department of Abnormal Psychiatry. . .

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.553
. ..at St. Mary's Hospital.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:56.688
Dr. Cartwright. Ring a bell?

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.648
Yes.

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:00.901
He was there?

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:04.112
-Yes.
-Father. ..

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.532
. ..if you want me to defend you,
you've got to give me...

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.242
. ..all the information l need.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:12.370
With all of this medical testimony
helping the prosecution.. .

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:15.957
. ..how could you not tell me
that a doctor attended the exorcism?

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:21.713
He asked that l keep
his involvement confidential...

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.673
. ..and l said l would.

01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:41.233
Dr. Cartwright?

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:47.322
l recognize you from those
courtroom drawings on the news.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.659
You're much prettier in real life.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:55.372
-May l sit?
-Yes, please.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.421
You're losing.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.510
l had hoped Father Moore
wouldn't need me. ..

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.263
. ..but l don't wanna see him
put away.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.641
How do you know him?

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:18.436
Well, l was his parishioner
at St. Vincent's Church. . .

01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:20.105
. ..about 1 5 years ago.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.901
l hadn't seen or heard of him for years
when he called me last fall.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.654
But he needed help, so. . ..

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.408
What kind of help, doctor?

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:35.620
He wanted a medical perspective
from a psychiatrist...

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:39.082
. ..you know, one that he knew,
trusted. ..

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:44.713
. ..to observe Emily's physical
and mental state during this. . . .

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:48.466
During the exorcism.

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.594
Yeah.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:01.479
Doctor.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:05.066
Can you help our case?

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:10.697
That girl was not schizophrenic. . .

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.992
. ..and she was not epileptic,
or any combination of the two.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.411
l've seen hundreds of people
with those problems.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.957
They can be terrible afflictions,
of course, but they don't scare me.

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:24.002
But what you saw that night in Emily,
that did scare you.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.880
God, if l'd known,
l never would've been there.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.261
l started praying again
since then, you know.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:40.560
l examined that girl before l drove
back to the city that night.

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.354
She was lucid...

01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:46.441
. ..and she was completely aware
of this separate entity inside her.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:51.863
When she wasn't in his grip, she was
totally herself, completely normal.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:56.076
The awareness of her alternate mental
state is counterindicative of psychosis.

01:05:56.243 --> 01:05:57.911
Crazy people
don't know they're crazy.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.537
That's right.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.291
You'll testify to all of this, in detail?

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.043
Everything you saw?

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:08.088
Send me the case files
and tell me when to be in court.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:10.298
Thank you, doctor.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.009
We need this.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:17.389
Before he was arrested,
Father Moore sent this to me.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:19.975
He asked me to take care of it.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.395
lt's your burden now.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.399
One more thing.
When you saw Emily...

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:30.568
. ..did Father Moore ask you
to give her any medical help?

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:35.824
He was already trying to stop her from
injuring herself and urging her to eat.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.660
And l told him, as a doctor,
l couldn't help her.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:48.920
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:55.885
Don't you get it?

01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:58.304
He's not just an eyewitness
to the exorcism.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:01.683
He can also refute the prosecution's
medical case. This is huge for us.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.893
When do l get to testify?

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.063
l don't know. Let's take this
one step at a time.

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:08.565
No.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:13.862
What matters most is Emily's story,
which only l can tell.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.365
l understand.

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.537
Have you thought about
what l said before?

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:27.500
About dark forces
and demonic attacks?

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.257
Yes, l have.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:43.349
That day, after Briggs testified. . .

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.854
...l was feeling awful.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:52.025
And l went out for a walk
just to clear my head...

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:56.488
...and l was thinking about
what you said to me. Thinking:

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.824
"What if demons really do exist?"

01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:03.495
And wondering what that
would mean if l believed that.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:09.375
Because God knows,
l have my own demons.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.379
And l saw something
lying on the sidewalk.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.386
lt was a gold locket...

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.682
...with the initials E.C.B.
engraved on it.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:30.395
My middle name is Christine.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:33.983
Erin Christine Bruner.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:39.363
And of all the people walking by
that day, l found that locket.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.323
What are the chances of that?

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:45.411
l don't know, maybe it was a sign.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:49.666
Or maybe it was just some
incredible coincidence.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.210
But it made me feel. . .

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:56.631
. ..like no matter what mistakes
l've made in the past.. .

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:00.593
. ..at that moment, l was exactly
where l was meant to be.

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.970
Like l was on the right path.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:09.060
You sound more like a mystic
than an agnostic.

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:13.148
Are you wearing the locket now?

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.109
No.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.237
You should.

01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:27.036
The archdiocese
doesn't want you to testify.

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:31.457
They're just afraid
that l'll embarrass them.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.919
Testify to some medieval-sounding
supernatural nonsense.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.921
They're expecting me
to talk you out of it.

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:40.800
l've just decided
l'm not even gonna try.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.053
Why not?

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:47.182
lf the archdiocese
wants to avoid embarrassment. . .

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:50.059
. ..they need you to walk out of here
a free man.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.395
l believe a jury will find you
sincere and credible. . .

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.441
. ..and when Dr. Cartwright
corroborates your testimony...

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.943
. ..and refutes the prosecution's
medical arguments...

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:00.778
. ..we'll get an acquittal.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.990
And everyone will thank me for it.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.116
Emily!

01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:01.589
God help me.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.100
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.518
l do.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.062
Father Moore, before you could
perform the exorcism...

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.856
. ..you had to get the sanction
of the Church, correct?

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:21.359
Yes, on October the 27th
of last year. . .

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:25.363
. .. l presented my assessment and
recommendation to the archbishop. ..

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:29.200
. ..and he authorized the exorcism
that day before l left the office.

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:32.370
Tell us what happened that night.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.330
l drove home.

01:11:34.498 --> 01:11:37.750
l sat up till after midnight
studying The Roman Ritual. ..

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:39.502
. ..thinking about what lay ahead.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.629
You mean The Roman Ritual
of Exorcism.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.381
A text used by Catholic priests...

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.591
. ..as a guide to performing
the exorcism rite.

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:48.469
Yes, l think l actually fell asleep
with the book in my hand.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.388
What happened next?

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.765
l woke up, freezing.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.060
It was exactly 3 a.m.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.980
Three a.m. is the demonic
witching hour.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:02.233
lt's a way for demons
to mock the Holy Trinity.

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:05.737
lt's an inversion of 3 p.m. ,
the miracle hour...

01:12:05.904 --> 01:12:10.575
. ..which is traditionally accepted
as the hour of Christ's death.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.578
l thought l smelled
something burning.

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:17.415
Only later did l connect it...

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.918
...and l remembered that that same
smell of something burning...

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:23.629
...had been perceived by Emily.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:38.079
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now and--

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:46.796
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our--

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.344
At the hour of--

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:28.379
What do you make of this gesture,
this nod in your direction?

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:34.469
l don't know. Some kind
of acknowledgment, l guess.

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:37.180
That the game is on.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:43.186
You're really God's gunslinger,
aren't you, Father?

01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:46.856
Standing tall and facing the devil
with your prayer book at your side.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.400
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's harassing my witness.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:54.030
Sustained. Mr. Thomas, you know
l won't allow that in my courtroom.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.240
Forgive me, Your Honor.

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:02.079
Father, did you understand this
black-robed figure to be the devil?

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:04.081
l believe it was
a demonic manifestation.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:06.626
Like the demonic force
you believe possessed Emily?

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:08.794
-Yes.
-Why do you think it appeared to you?

01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:11.339
l believe the demonic
can appear as an apparition...

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.509
. ..much like a ghost,
in an attempt to excite our fear.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:18.012
-Did it excite your fear, Father?
-lt scared the hell out of me.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.682
So this night, when you began to
prepare Emily's exorcism. . .

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.310
. ..was it your first encounter
with this demon ghost?

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.395
-Yes.
-Have you seen it again?

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.275
l've seen it ever since.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.325
No further questions at this time.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.915
Redirect, Your Honor.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:50.545
Father Moore, after you received
the bishop's authorization. . .

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.505
. ..when did you proceed
with an exorcism?

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:54.006
October 31 st.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.009
On Halloween.
lsn't that a bit dramatic?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.055
Halloween tradition is based on
legends throughout history...

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.392
. ..that indicate a real increase
in spiritual activity on that night...

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.645
. ..and l thought we could use the
occasion to draw them into the open.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.022
-The demons, you mean?
-Yes.

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:11.649
Father Moore...

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.486
. ..can you identify this?

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.448
lt's my tape recorder.
l used it to record the exorcism.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.660
lnside is the tape l made that night.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.580
Why would you make such a tape?

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.832
Ever since the technology
has been available. . .

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.502
. ..exorcists have used tape recorders
to authenticate the ritual. . .

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.379
. ..and provide a record for review.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:36.591
l offer into evidence this
cassette recorder and audiotape.. . .

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:40.011
Objection. The people were not aware
of the existence of this tape...

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:41.887
-. . .until last night.
-Neither were we.

01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:45.057
This tape is new evidence that came
into our possession yesterday.

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:48.477
We provided counsel for the people
with a transcript of its contents.

01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:51.063
You mean this tape was not
given to you by your client?

01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:53.816
No, Your Honor. We received it
from a reluctant witness...

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:57.570
. ..Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also
be called to testify to its authenticity.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:17:00.531
The people will find his name
on the updated witness list. ..

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.366
. ..we provided to them this morning.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:09.040
Very well. l'll allow it into evidence.

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.629
Father Moore.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.549
Will you play the tape for us now?

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.934
This is the exorcism of Emily Rose.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:32.897
Those present are myself,
Father Richard Moore...

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.401
. ..Nathaniel, Emily's father. . .

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:41.530
. ..Jason, her friend. . .

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.911
. ..a doctor who is here
to monitor Emily during the ritual...

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:49.497
. ..and Emily herself.. .

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.584
. ..who has given her permission
for the ritual to be performed.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.796
All right, now listen.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.802
You may say the rosary or any
private prayer for her deliverance...

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:06.013
. ..when you're not responding
to my words.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.973
Above all...

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.310
. ..do whatever l ask,
without question.

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:15.648
Don't ask it any questions.. .

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:19.193
. ..or pay any attention
to what it says.

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:21.987
"lt"?

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:24.573
We won't be dealing
with Emily tonight.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:31.414
Restrain her.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:42.758
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:05.448
lt has begun.

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:07.032
Let us pray.

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.500
"Because she hopes
in you, my God."

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:19.628
"Send her help from
the holy place, Lord."

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:22.506
"And give her heavenly protection."

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:24.800
"May the Lord be with you."

01:19:24.968 --> 01:19:27.344
"And with your spirit."

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:32.683
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:36.562
My God. Are you all right?

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:39.023
Dolls and kisses
and crosses and wishes. . .

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.026
. ..you think that can save
your little girl?

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:49.533
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:51.452
l'm fine.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.205
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:59.835
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.

01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:01.921
And lead us not into temptation--

01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:06.383
But deliver us from evil!

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:11.263
Who are you, demon?
Tell me your name.

01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:23.234
l am the one who dwells within. . . .

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.110
ln the Name of Christ.. .

01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:27.404
. ..identify yourself!

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:31.116
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:34.411
Trick or treat.
l give you treats and tricks.

01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:37.498
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:44.630
Father Moore!

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:56.934
Papa!

01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:25.045
Emily!

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:30.384
She feels so hot, Father!
She's burning up!

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:37.474
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!

01:21:42.522 --> 01:21:43.772
Emily!

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.874
Doctor! l need you here now.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.670
Watch her vital signs.

01:22:07.797 --> 01:22:10.341
ln the beginning was the word.

01:22:10.508 --> 01:22:12.301
And the word was with God.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:15.930
And the word was the word,
and what a wonderful word it was.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:17.473
Through him all things remain.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.267
Without him, nothing was made
that has been made.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:25.481
And the 70 disciples
returned again with joy, saying:

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:29.401
"Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name."

01:22:29.569 --> 01:22:32.821
Her heart is racing.
lt's almost 1 80 beats a minute.

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:36.784
l beheld Satan as lightning
fall from heaven.

01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:41.747
Behold. l give you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions. . .

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.083
. ..and over all the power
of the enemy.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.378
And nothing shall,
by any means, hurt you.

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:49.713
Nothing. . .?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:11.777
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:23.372
Release him, demon. l command you
in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.011
Tell me your name, wicked one.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.096
One, two, three, four, five, six!

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.890
He who commands you is he
who ordered you thrown down...

01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:44.601
. ..from the highest heaven
into the depths of hell.

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:49.773
ln the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
l now command you:

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:51.191
Tell me your name!

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.360
One, two, three, four, five, six!

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:57.656
Hear, therefore, and fear,
Satan, enemy of the faith.

01:23:58.074 --> 01:23:59.700
Give me your name, demon!

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:06.623
Names!

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:12.337
One, two, three, four, five, six!

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:15.257
Ancient serpents. . .

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:19.344
. ..depart from this servant of God!

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.097
Tell me your six names!

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:27.728
We are the ones who dwell within!

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:31.148
l am the one who dwelt within Cain!

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:34.610
l am the one who dwelt within Nero!

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:38.322
l once dwelt within Judas!

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:39.907
And l was with Legion!

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.659
l am Belial!

01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:47.206
And l am Lucifer. . .

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:50.250
. ..the devil in the flesh.

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:07.351
Mr. Rose.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.603
Doctor, help him!

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:29.623
After a few moments,
Mr. Rose revived...

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.584
...but the exorcism
had to be abandoned.

01:25:33.044 --> 01:25:38.090
Emily was taken to her room
and soon fell into a deep sleep.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:41.135
The whole thing
was a complete failure.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:45.055
Describe her behavior from the night
of the failed exorcism...

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.890
. ..until the time of her death.

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.393
Violence towards others and herself.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.437
Sometimes she screamed
for hours on end.

01:25:52.605 --> 01:25:55.774
She drove her head through windows,
tried to bite....

01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:59.194
Tried to bite holes in the walls,
breaking several more of her teeth. . .

01:25:59.362 --> 01:26:01.822
. ..as you saw in
the postmortem photograph.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.158
-You witnessed this?
-Some of it, yes.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.535
l tried to visit every day. . .

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.745
. ..and the family told me the rest.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.497
Did you attempt another exorcism?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:14.168
l wanted to, but Emily refused.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:16.211
And without the consent
of the possessed. . .

01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:18.839
. ..the exorcism ritual
can't be performed.

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.632
Did you encourage her to eat?

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.302
Yes, every time l saw her. ..

01:26:23.469 --> 01:26:26.513
. ..but the few times she tried,
it seemed like....

01:26:27.056 --> 01:26:29.933
Seemed like she couldn't swallow,
or she couldn't keep it down.

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:31.435
What about medical care?

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:35.022
l wanted her to continue. l never said
she should quit seeing her doctors.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.608
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:40.986
But you did suggest she stop
taking the drug Gambutrol.

01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:45.699
Yes.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:51.705
After the exorcism,
she asked for my counsel.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:54.374
She told me that the drugs
had never helped her.

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:57.419
After all, she was on Gambutrol
during the exorcism...

01:26:57.587 --> 01:27:00.130
. ..when her so-called symptoms
were at their peak.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:05.636
Ultimately, we both felt that
she was beyond medical care. . .

01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:10.224
. ..and that she had to see this
through to the end. . .

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:12.809
. ..by faith alone.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:20.984
The dual voices we just heard
on this tape...

01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:26.156
. ..you're certain that they were both
coming from Emily at the same time?

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:27.616
Yes. Yes, l heard them.

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:30.285
Have you tampered
with this tape in any way?

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.329
No. No, l have not.

01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:36.333
No further questions at this time.

01:27:41.047 --> 01:27:42.339
Mr. Thomas.

01:27:46.135 --> 01:27:50.305
Father Moore, you consider this tape
to be proof of the supernatural?

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:55.018
l think it's a record
of certain indications...

01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:57.104
. ..that Emily was possessed.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.981
Signs of possession,
you may call them.

01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:02.359
By "signs of possession," would you
mean her speaking in languages...

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.528
. ..we might assume
she couldn't possibly know?

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:07.864
And the vocalization of two
distinct voices simultaneously?

01:28:08.032 --> 01:28:11.410
Yes. Among other signs that l
observed and described to the court. . .

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:13.537
. ..while the tape was playing.
Things l saw.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.205
Things you can't hear
on the tape.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.332
We'll just have to take
your word, won't we?

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.167
-Your Honor.
-Mr. Thomas.

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.629
l apologize.
Father, as Emily's parish priest. . .

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.674
. ..are you aware that she underwent
advanced catechism training?

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.426
Yes. Yes. Her family is very devout.

01:28:27.593 --> 01:28:31.013
And in that training, did she study
Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.347
Yes, l think that's right.

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:35.892
Might have even studied Aramaic,
Christ and his disciples' language...

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.563
. ..which, according to the transcripts,
we also heard on the tape, correct?

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.524
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
lt wasn't part of her training.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.277
But it was offered as an elective
at her catechism school.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:48.280
l have the school's curriculum
here if you'd like to see it.

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:52.242
No. l'll accept that she might have
been exposed to that language.

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.286
And according to
her high school records...

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:57.039
. ..German was the foreign language
she studied there, yes?

01:28:57.206 --> 01:28:58.415
l don't know. lf you say so.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:02.210
So that covers the strange languages
we heard on the tape, correct?

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.838
Did l miss any?

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:07.299
-No.
-Good.

01:29:07.467 --> 01:29:09.760
We've already established
you're no medical expert.

01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:11.261
You said it's not your field.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:15.140
But are you aware of the dual sets of
vocal cords every human possesses?

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:16.683
-No.
-Have you heard of. . .

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:21.188
. ..the superior vocal cords, which are
higher than the ones we use to speak?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.066
No. So you didn't know that
Tibetan monks, for example. . .

01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:26.985
. ..as part of their religious training,
teach themselves. . .

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:30.614
. ..to activate both sets
of vocal cords at once?

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.449
No, l didn't know that.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:35.285
Well, now that you do know,
would you think it's possible...

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:37.245
. ..that Emily, in her psychotic state. . .

01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:39.706
. ..might have activated both sets
of vocal cords. . .

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:43.293
. ..so as to achieve the amazing effect
we heard captured on your audiotape?

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:44.795
Her state was not psychotic.

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:47.631
Father Moore, you told us
that in the exorcism we heard. . .

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:51.301
. ..you actually saw, once again,
this black-robed figure. . .

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:54.137
-. . .or demonic apparition, am l right?
-Yes.

01:29:54.305 --> 01:29:56.932
But we couldn't see him
when you played the tape, correct?

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.642
-No, of course not.
-Of course not.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.645
So that would be another
supernatural aspect of the exorcism. . .

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:05.315
-. . .your tape doesn't prove, correct?
-Yes.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:08.068
Where is your dark figure, Father?

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.570
ls he here now?
Do l look like your demon ghost?

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.656
-Your Honor.
-Counselor.

01:30:16.327 --> 01:30:18.203
l have nothing further.

01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:21.206
Does the defense wish to redirect?

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:24.835
No, Your Honor, but we reserve
the right to recall the witness later.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:27.879
Very well.
The witness may step down.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:37.681
Your Honor, my next witness
must have been detained.

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:39.850
lf we could take a short recess
so l could--

01:30:40.017 --> 01:30:43.520
You've made this court wait before,
counselor. l'm inclined to--

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:45.355
Your Honor, please.

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:48.191
Dr. Cartwright came to us
in good conscience...

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:51.528
. ..as an eyewitness to the exorcism
on Father Moore's tape.

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.781
He can substantiate
all of my client's testimony--

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:58.118
Your Honor, the defense has already
presented its exorcism testimony...

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.871
. ..in dramatic fashion.
Do we really have to--?

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.797
We have absorbed some
extraordinary testimony today.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.884
l think we'll take some time
to consider it.

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:16.761
Court is adjourned
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

01:31:19.223 --> 01:31:22.184
-You can't find him?
-l went to meet him, he didn't show.

01:31:22.351 --> 01:31:24.394
l called his office, l called his house.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:29.232
Okay. Go to the hospital, ask around.
Somebody's gotta know where he is.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.371
What the hell happened?

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:47.250
Tell Father Moore l'm sorry.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:51.505
Tell him l know the demons are real
and l admire his courage...

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.882
. ..for standing and speaking
against them.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.927
Tell him l know what they can do.

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:22.410
-Cartwright's dead.
-l heard.

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:24.996
Are you drunk?

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:30.210
-Not yet, but l'm working on it.
-Have you seen this?

01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:37.592
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Karl....

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.136
You told me you'd talk him out
of testifying.

01:32:40.304 --> 01:32:42.639
lnstead, you put on a freak show
with taped demons. . .

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:44.599
. ..and a dead girl
speaking in tongues...

01:32:44.767 --> 01:32:48.979
. ..and your client testifies that the
archbishop sanctioned the exorcism.

01:32:49.605 --> 01:32:51.690
We'll be lucky if
the archdiocese isn't named--

01:32:51.857 --> 01:32:54.317
l had a doctor
who was gonna corroborate.

01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:57.487
Besides that, Father Moore's
testimony's crucial to his defense.

01:32:57.655 --> 01:33:00.198
Did you forget the archdiocese
is paying for this defense?

01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:02.200
The archdiocese isn't on trial.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.496
l swore an oath to do
what's best for my client.

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:08.832
Spare me the law school pieties,
Bruner.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.042
You cashed in your conscience
at the door.

01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:14.129
-People can change.
-Like James Van Hopper?

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.342
lt's not over.

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.761
l can put Mr. Rose on the stand. . .

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.139
. ..to corroborate Father Moore
about the exorcism.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:27.142
And there are the girls.
Her sister Alice, she saw part of it.

01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.270
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.813
Thomas will rip them to pieces.

01:33:31.981 --> 01:33:34.691
You'll be worse off than you are now,
if that's possible.

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.485
You're gonna replace me
on this case.

01:33:38.195 --> 01:33:40.280
You've screwed it up
beyond all repair.

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:43.325
But the archdiocese feels
that replacing you now. . .

01:33:43.492 --> 01:33:46.369
. ..would only draw more
unnecessary attention to the trial.

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:48.121
But just so we're clear, Bruner. . .

01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:53.043
. ..if you put that priest
on the stand again, l will fire you.

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:21.655
You've been crying.

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:28.161
-Dr. Cartwright is dead.
-What?

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:33.416
He was killed.
There was an accident. l'm sorry.

01:34:36.295 --> 01:34:38.421
l know he was your friend.

01:34:42.426 --> 01:34:43.927
We've lost.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.640
Without his testimony, it's over.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.434
No.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:55.939
No, no, no, it isn't over. We're telling
Emily's story. That's what matters.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.316
-lt can't be worth all this.
-Yes, it is worth it.

01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:01.569
Just let me go back on the stand
and tell the rest of the story.

01:35:01.737 --> 01:35:03.905
-l can't do that.
-You must!

01:35:04.448 --> 01:35:06.199
You must.

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:16.501
Erin, you once said that you felt
you were on the right path.

01:35:17.586 --> 01:35:20.630
Don't stray from that path.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:23.633
Here, take this.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:26.177
-What is this?
-Just read it.

01:35:26.345 --> 01:35:29.764
And then decide
what you want to do.

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:36.187
I saw your eyes today in court when
l explained the significance of 3 a.m.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:42.986
lt's not going to stop
until Emily's story is told.

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.404
Are you gonna make a statement?

01:36:28.699 --> 01:36:30.784
Do you believe it was the devil?

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:44.964
ls the defense ready to proceed?

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:49.052
Yes, Your Honor. The defense
recalls Father Richard Moore.

01:36:56.393 --> 01:36:59.729
The witness is reminded
that he is still under oath.

01:37:09.198 --> 01:37:12.408
-When did you last see Emily alive?
-The night before she died.

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:15.870
Her mother, Maria, called me
and said that Emily had asked for me.

01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:18.623
-Why did she ask to see you?
-To give me this.

01:37:19.124 --> 01:37:21.459
Did Emily explain to you
the letter's significance?

01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:26.965
Yes. She said she'd written it the
morning after the failed exorcism...

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.634
. ..and that it was important
for me to share.

01:37:33.639 --> 01:37:36.516
Father Moore,
was Emily a good person?

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:43.439
l believe that one day
Emily will be recognized as a saint.

01:37:44.441 --> 01:37:47.277
-So she loved God.
-Yes. She was very devout.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.280
Father Moore, if Emily loved God. ..

01:37:50.447 --> 01:37:53.199
. ..if she was so good and so devout,
why do you think God. . .

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.118
-. . .allowed this to happen?
-Objection.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:56.953
What is the relevance
of that question?

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:59.372
Father Moore's belief
in this matter is crucial...

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.584
. ..in establishing his and Emily's
understanding of her condition.

01:38:02.751 --> 01:38:05.753
And that mutual understanding
is paramount in determining. . .

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:08.131
. ..whether Father Moore was,
in fact, negligent.

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:12.135
l'm going to allow it.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.846
Your Honor, you're not really gonna
let someone testify. . .

01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:18.182
. ..about why God would allow
the death of a young girl?

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:20.894
The objection has been overruled.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.229
Again, Father Moore:

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:29.277
Why did God allow Emily to become
possessed by demons and then die?

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.030
l can let Emily answer that.

01:38:36.493 --> 01:38:39.495
"Last night, on Allhallows' Eve. . .

01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:44.167
. ..Father Moore tried to cast
six demons from my body.

01:38:44.793 --> 01:38:46.586
They refused to go.

01:38:47.796 --> 01:38:50.298
After the attempted exorcism. . . ."

01:38:50.633 --> 01:38:55.303
I was taken to my room,
and l fell into a deep sleep.

01:38:57.139 --> 01:39:02.185
l awoke a few hours later,
hearing a voice calling out my name.

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:20.054
"Again, I heard a voice
calling my name.

01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:23.808
lt was the Blessed Holy Mother
of God.

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.978
And when l looked at her. . .

01:40:27.563 --> 01:40:30.815
. ..she smiled at me and said:

01:40:31.608 --> 01:40:34.777
'Emily, heaven is not blind
to your pain.'"

01:40:34.945 --> 01:40:38.489
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her
in the middle of a field?

01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:41.451
-Yes.
-And do you believe her?

01:40:41.618 --> 01:40:43.494
l believe Emily spoke the truth.

01:40:45.122 --> 01:40:46.497
Please continue.

01:40:49.084 --> 01:40:53.296
"l asked the Blessed Mother,
'Why do l suffer like this?'"

01:40:53.922 --> 01:40:56.924
Why did the demons
not leave me tonight?

01:40:58.343 --> 01:41:01.679
"She said, 'l am sorry, Emily.

01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.016
The demons are going to stay
where they are.'

01:41:05.809 --> 01:41:09.145
Then she said,
'You can come with me in peace...

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:12.148
...free of your bodily form...

01:41:12.649 --> 01:41:15.777
...or you can choose
to continue this.

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:19.113
You will suffer greatly.

01:41:19.281 --> 01:41:24.994
But through you, many will come to
see that the realm of the spirit is real.

01:41:26.997 --> 01:41:29.832
The choice is yours.'"

01:41:37.674 --> 01:41:39.801
l choose to stay.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:13.751
"ln the end,
good will triumph over evil.

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:16.712
Through my experience. ..

01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:20.091
. ..people will know
that demons are real.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:26.264
People say that God is dead.

01:42:28.892 --> 01:42:31.394
But how can they think that. . .

01:42:31.937 --> 01:42:34.063
. ..if l show them the devil?"

01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:43.614
Did you see these wounds on both
of Emily's hands and both feet?

01:42:43.782 --> 01:42:48.744
Yes. Yes, the wounds
lasted for some time.

01:42:48.912 --> 01:42:53.166
And did you attach any supernatural
significance to these wounds?

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:57.461
l believe they were stigmata.

01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:59.630
By that, you mean
supernatural injuries...

01:42:59.798 --> 01:43:02.800
. ..that correspond to the crucifixion
wounds of Jesus Christ?

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.635
Yes.

01:43:05.762 --> 01:43:11.976
Stigmata are a sign, a mark
indicating one is touched by God.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:20.359
After that night, why do you think
Emily refused another exorcism?

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:24.989
l believe she'd accepted her fate.

01:43:27.409 --> 01:43:30.453
ls there anything else
you'd like to say about Emily?

01:43:34.666 --> 01:43:36.125
No.

01:43:39.129 --> 01:43:40.838
The defense rests.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:52.266
Father Moore attaches
divine significance...

01:43:52.434 --> 01:43:55.978
. ..to the wounds
on Emily's hands and feet.

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:57.647
Why?

01:43:58.982 --> 01:44:02.985
Because he sees them as confirmation
of what he wants to believe.

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:07.490
That Emily was a saint,
touched by the hand of God.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:12.036
l'm afraid the truth
is far less inspiring.

01:44:12.704 --> 01:44:18.042
Because the truth is, by the time
these miraculous wounds appeared. . .

01:44:18.543 --> 01:44:21.379
. ..Emily had already shown
a tendency to injure herself...

01:44:21.546 --> 01:44:24.840
. ..and simply did so again
on one of the barbed-wire fences. . .

01:44:25.008 --> 01:44:28.386
. ..surrounding the Rose family farm.

01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:39.563
Father Moore's beliefs are based on
archaic and irrational superstition.

01:44:39.731 --> 01:44:42.775
Emily suffered
because she was sick...

01:44:44.152 --> 01:44:45.903
. ..not because she was a saint.

01:44:48.198 --> 01:44:51.867
l'm a man of faith.
And l am also a man of facts.

01:44:52.494 --> 01:44:58.082
And in here,
facts are what must matter.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:01.877
And these are the facts of this case:

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:07.008
Emily Rose had epilepsy,
which caused psychosis.

01:45:07.342 --> 01:45:10.886
And, given time,
medicine would have cured her.

01:45:11.054 --> 01:45:15.558
But it didn't. Why? Because Father
Richard Moore convinced Emily...

01:45:15.726 --> 01:45:20.187
. ..that she wasn't ill,
that she didn't need medicine.

01:45:20.355 --> 01:45:23.190
And in the weeks
leading up to her death. ..

01:45:23.358 --> 01:45:27.445
. ..when she was clearly in need
of medical treatment. ..

01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:30.364
. ..he failed to have her hospitalized.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.917
So...

01:45:42.627 --> 01:45:45.880
. ..the defense has given us
an extraordinary. . .

01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:51.052
. ..creative explanation
for the events that led to this.

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:57.892
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you believe it.

01:45:58.352 --> 01:46:03.105
Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil
that did this to Emily Rose.

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.694
lt was the defendant.

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:31.342
Counselor.

01:46:36.973 --> 01:46:40.643
Ethan Thomas calls himself
a man of faith.

01:46:46.024 --> 01:46:48.818
l, on the other hand,
am a woman of doubt.

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:55.074
Angels and demons.

01:46:55.867 --> 01:46:57.785
God and the devil.

01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:05.167
These things either exist,
or they do not exist.

01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:09.630
Are we all alone in this life?

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.341
Or are we not alone?

01:47:13.218 --> 01:47:15.136
Either thought is astonishing.

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:23.144
Do l really believe that this tragedy
is the work of the devil?

01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:25.104
To be honest, l don't know.

01:47:26.731 --> 01:47:29.525
But l cannot deny that it's possible.

01:47:30.152 --> 01:47:31.986
The prosecution
wants you to believe. ..

01:47:32.154 --> 01:47:35.489
. ..that Emily's psychotic
epileptic disorder was a fact...

01:47:35.657 --> 01:47:39.785
. ..because facts leave no room
for reasonable doubt.

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:42.204
But this trial isn't about facts.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.916
This trial is about possibilities.

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:49.211
ls it a fact that Emily
was a hypersensitive. . .

01:47:49.379 --> 01:47:50.921
. ..as Dr. Adani suggests?

01:47:51.089 --> 01:47:56.844
A person who's more likely, by her
very nature, to become possessed?

01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:02.057
l can't say that, but the question is:

01:48:02.684 --> 01:48:03.893
ls it possible?

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:09.857
ls it a fact that Gambutrol
anesthetized Emily's brain...

01:48:10.025 --> 01:48:13.486
. ..so that the exorcism ritual
was rendered ineffective?

01:48:15.697 --> 01:48:17.531
l can't be sure of that.

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:21.160
But is it possible?

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:27.124
ls it a fact that Emily
was beloved by God?

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:32.713
And that after her exorcism,
she chose to suffer till the end. . .

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:35.799
. ..so that we might believe
in a more magical world?

01:48:35.967 --> 01:48:39.678
A world where the spiritual realm
really exists?

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:42.348
l can't say that's a fact.

01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:45.184
But ask yourself:

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:48.812
ls it possible?

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.566
lt's what Emily believed.

01:48:52.734 --> 01:48:54.443
lt's what Father Moore believed.

01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:59.281
And that sincere belief is what
determined her choices and his.

01:48:59.449 --> 01:49:03.202
Now, for the most
important question:

01:49:04.663 --> 01:49:07.373
ls Father Richard Moore guilty. . .

01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:11.293
. ..beyond a reasonable doubt,
of negligent homicide?

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:16.715
Did he, in fact, neglect
Emily's needs in such a way. . .

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:19.301
. ..that her death
is now on his hands?

01:49:19.469 --> 01:49:23.556
No! That is not a fact.

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:26.475
lt is not a fact
that Emily was epileptic.

01:49:26.643 --> 01:49:31.063
lt is not a fact
that she was psychotic.

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.731
Facts...

01:49:33.441 --> 01:49:36.735
. ..leave no room for possibilities.

01:49:38.154 --> 01:49:39.572
The only fact. . .

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:44.827
. ..the only thing l know
beyond a doubt in this case.. .

01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:48.539
. ..is that Father Moore
loved Emily with his whole heart.

01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:52.251
He did everything in his power
to help her.

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:57.172
He has risked his very freedom
so we could hear her story.

01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:05.681
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

01:50:05.849 --> 01:50:09.226
. ..in my job l sometimes
have to defend bad men.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:13.522
Father Richard Moore
is not one of them.

01:50:16.693 --> 01:50:18.611
Don't send a good man to prison.

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:21.864
l'm not asking that you believe
everything that Father Moore believes.

01:50:22.032 --> 01:50:25.492
l'm simply asking that you believe
in Father Moore.

01:50:42.552 --> 01:50:44.637
Madam Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

01:50:44.929 --> 01:50:46.513
We have, Your Honor.

01:50:58.610 --> 01:51:00.736
Please read the verdict out loud.

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:08.410
"ln the case of The People
v. Father Richard Moore...

01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:11.372
. ..we, the jury, find the defendant. . .

01:51:11.539 --> 01:51:14.458
. ..guilty of negligent homicide."

01:51:16.252 --> 01:51:18.671
The court thanks the jury
for its service.

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:23.967
Sentencing for this case
will be set for April 3rd.

01:51:24.135 --> 01:51:26.303
Your Honor, if it pleases the court. . .

01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:28.681
. ..Father Moore requested
at the start of trial. . .

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:31.642
. ..that if found guilty,
he would be sentenced immediately.

01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.769
Yes, l recall that.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:38.148
Does the prosecution have any
objection to expedited sentencing?

01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:40.693
Very well.

01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:47.449
Father Richard Moore,
do you understand this sentence. . .

01:51:47.617 --> 01:51:50.285
-. . .which has been found against you?
-Yes, Your Honor.

01:51:50.453 --> 01:51:52.830
And do you understand
the gravity of this crime?

01:51:52.997 --> 01:51:57.501
That you may, under the law, be
sentenced to a term of up to 1 0 years?

01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:59.002
Yes, l do.

01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:01.130
Are there any statements
you wish to make. ..

01:52:01.297 --> 01:52:02.881
. ..before l impose this sentence?

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.967
-No, Your Honor.
-Very well.

01:52:05.135 --> 01:52:07.261
Excuse me, Your Honor.. .

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:09.805
. ..but the jury would like to make
a recommendation.. .

01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:11.849
-. . .regarding the sentence.
-Objection.

01:52:12.308 --> 01:52:13.809
Sit down, counselor.

01:52:13.977 --> 01:52:17.521
lt's only a recommendation,
and l would like to hear it.

01:52:19.983 --> 01:52:22.526
We recommend a sentence
of time served.

01:52:32.662 --> 01:52:33.996
l'll accept that.

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:40.502
You are guilty, Father Moore.

01:52:41.755 --> 01:52:43.505
And you are free to go.

01:52:44.841 --> 01:52:47.843
-This court is dismissed.
-All rise.

01:52:55.852 --> 01:52:57.186
Thank you.

01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:27.174
Well, you shocked us all.

01:53:27.717 --> 01:53:30.177
Everyone at the firm sees this
as another victory.

01:53:30.345 --> 01:53:32.387
The archdiocese is pleased.

01:53:32.555 --> 01:53:35.474
They feel the trial has raised
public interest in the Church.

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:37.392
Have you seen the news?

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.145
There's our priest,
leaving the courthouse a free man...

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:41.980
. ..right next to you.

01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:44.566
Just like James Van Hopper.

01:53:46.402 --> 01:53:48.403
All right, l'll say it. l was wrong.

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.072
But l'm ready to make it right.

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.408
l'm offering you
a full partnership in the firm.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.580
Keep it.

01:54:22.981 --> 01:54:25.732
Will you be able to return
to your parish?

01:54:29.112 --> 01:54:30.779
l can't go back.

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.781
Not now.

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:36.952
Once you've looked
into the darkness...

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:41.623
. .. l think you carry it with you
for the rest of your life.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.462
What about you?

01:54:49.966 --> 01:54:52.634
l believe you've seen
the darkness too.

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:57.931
l don't know.

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:02.686
l'm not sure what l've seen.

01:55:11.696 --> 01:55:15.157
-Who chose the epitaph?
-l did.

01:55:15.992 --> 01:55:19.912
lt's from the second chapter
of Philippians, verse 1 2.

01:55:20.538 --> 01:55:22.538
Emily recited it to me
the night before she died.
