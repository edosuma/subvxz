WEBVTT

00:00.485 --> 00:02.352
<i>When I make a move to change the way</i>

00:02.388 --> 00:03.754
Boden's doing things, I want to make sure

00:03.789 --> 00:05.389
that you're ready to step up.

00:05.424 --> 00:07.324
Yes, Chief, I am.

00:07.429 --> 00:08.995
Are we doing something wrong here?

00:09.031 --> 00:11.531
Why shouldn't we go for it?

00:11.567 --> 00:13.166
Get a C-collar on this guy.

00:13.202 --> 00:15.368
You keep consistently
undermining my authority.

00:15.404 --> 00:16.870
Take the next shift off.

00:16.905 --> 00:19.372
- You're suspending me?
- You're lucky that's all.

00:19.408 --> 00:21.174
Wallace Boden, can you
tell me if you've ever

00:21.210 --> 00:22.976
been at the house of Serena Holmes?

00:23.011 --> 00:24.244
<i>Yeah, she locked herself out.</i>

00:24.279 --> 00:25.579
Wow, thank you.

00:25.614 --> 00:28.115
She told us a man named
Boden broke down her door

00:28.150 --> 00:29.483
and attacked her.

00:29.518 --> 00:30.884
I'd like you to come with me.

00:33.755 --> 00:35.989
Run it by me again,

00:36.024 --> 00:39.392
the nature of your
relationship with Ms. Holmes.

00:39.428 --> 00:41.728
I told you before, we
don't have a relationship.

00:41.763 --> 00:42.963
She rented the apartment next door.

00:42.998 --> 00:45.265
She asked for my assistance.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.000
And you gave it to her, correct?

00:47.035 --> 00:48.401
Yes, I did.

00:48.437 --> 00:49.536
Kicked her door down?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.304
At her request, yes.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.606
Like you, I'm a civil servant.

00:52.641 --> 00:55.909
People need help, I don't hesitate.

00:55.944 --> 00:58.411
Did you touch Ms. Holmes at that time?

01:00.816 --> 01:02.482
No, I did not.

01:02.518 --> 01:04.985
Threaten her in any way?

01:11.193 --> 01:14.494
Are we finished here?

01:14.530 --> 01:16.263
Put it this way.

01:16.298 --> 01:21.434
Your account doesn't exactly
jibe with the 911 call.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.503
Feel like changing it, I'd do so

01:23.539 --> 01:27.040
before the State's Attorney
approves felony charges.

01:33.749 --> 01:36.449
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36.485 --> 01:40.153
- How was the drive?
- The usual... long.

01:40.189 --> 01:43.723
- Hey.
- Good to see ya.

01:43.759 --> 01:45.926
- Suspended?
- Yeah, it's not big deal.

01:45.961 --> 01:47.360
The hell it isn't.

01:47.396 --> 01:48.361
What the hell kind of operation's

01:48.397 --> 01:49.529
Wally Boden running anyway?

01:49.565 --> 01:51.198
The captain is the one who dinged me.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.832
I got it under control.

01:52.868 --> 01:54.334
How much longer you in town?

01:54.369 --> 01:56.169
I was going to split right after the gala,

01:56.205 --> 01:57.470
until I heard this

01:57.506 --> 01:59.806
jag-off put you on ice. You hit him back?

01:59.841 --> 02:01.441
Look, it's been a rough couple days.

02:01.476 --> 02:03.476
I don't need you coming in here
and telling me what I did wrong.

02:03.512 --> 02:06.146
Don't be rolling over, Kelly.

02:06.181 --> 02:08.815
- Benny.
- Hey, Casey.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.684
You got a take on this mess?

02:10.719 --> 02:12.686
We put a call into the union reps.

02:12.721 --> 02:14.487
It's just a ding right now.

02:14.523 --> 02:15.989
In my day, somebody came at your buddy,

02:16.024 --> 02:18.491
he got dragged into the alley.

02:18.527 --> 02:20.393
First of all, this is a captain...

02:20.429 --> 02:23.196
who stepped up to Kelly off-duty, in a bar.

02:23.232 --> 02:24.331
Fair game.

02:24.366 --> 02:26.366
Second of all, if Kelly had kept his cool,

02:26.401 --> 02:27.801
it may not have come to this.

02:27.836 --> 02:31.304
And yes, I got his back, if
that's what you're asking.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.206
Do you?

02:33.242 --> 02:35.041
It's good seeing you, Benny.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.077
Running late for shift.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.084
This guy, what's his name?

02:44.119 --> 02:46.820
Don't get involved.

02:46.855 --> 02:49.256
Something Patterson, right?

02:54.129 --> 02:56.129
[laughs]

02:57.599 --> 02:58.798
I can't stop thinking about you.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.501
I know. Same.

03:01.536 --> 03:03.270
Not at work, though, right?

03:03.305 --> 03:06.273
- Never.
- Oh.

03:13.915 --> 03:16.349
You hear anything from Chief, Lieutenant?

03:16.385 --> 03:18.685
I went by his office. The lights were out.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.853
Left a message.

03:19.888 --> 03:21.588
Said he'll be in in a couple hours.

03:21.623 --> 03:23.156
Is everything okay?

03:23.191 --> 03:25.392
Far as I know. Why?

03:25.427 --> 03:28.928
Well, 18 years I been
crawling hallways with the guy,

03:28.964 --> 03:31.164
and never once has he been late to shift.

03:31.199 --> 03:33.667
That guy's the Cal Ripken of the CFD.

03:33.702 --> 03:36.469
Silent auction for the
charity gala kicks off today

03:36.505 --> 03:39.205
and all proceeds go to
help young burn victims,

03:39.241 --> 03:41.207
so don't be cheap asses!

03:41.243 --> 03:42.809
Four-man Squad today.

03:42.844 --> 03:44.444
More drills for everyone.

03:44.479 --> 03:45.945
- Severide dodged a bullet.
- Yeah.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.317
I'm not expecting a Christmas card,

03:50.352 --> 03:52.218
and I don't give a damn if you like me,

03:52.254 --> 03:53.920
but you will respect the rank.

03:56.224 --> 03:59.559
- Understood?
- [alarm sounds]

Back up!

04:27.589 --> 04:28.855
- You see what happened?
- Yeah,

04:28.890 --> 04:30.123
I was ringing up a customer.

04:30.158 --> 04:31.958
The guy swerved to avoid
a car and hit the curb.

04:31.993 --> 04:33.827
It launched like a missile.

04:33.862 --> 04:35.628
It must've have killed him on impact.

04:35.664 --> 04:37.997
Come over here. It's gonna be okay.

05:01.788 --> 05:03.421
Shallow breathing, rapid pulse.

05:03.456 --> 05:05.456
We don't transport him
fast, he's gonna bleed out.

05:05.492 --> 05:07.725
Keep his weight off the
glass. We'll cut him out.

05:07.761 --> 05:08.960
Herrmann, backboards and cribbing.

05:08.995 --> 05:10.528
<i>Two of them. You and Dawson inside.</i>

05:10.563 --> 05:13.865
- Mouch and Otis out.
- Help me, please!

05:13.900 --> 05:15.600
Guys, you need to back up.

05:15.635 --> 05:18.636
[crowd murmuring]

05:19.973 --> 05:22.407
Hey, back up.

05:22.442 --> 05:24.075
Jimmy, traffic control.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.444
Get those rubberneckers
the hell out of here.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.714
Keep it moving. Let's go.

05:29.749 --> 05:31.282
Lung's nicked. He's crashing.

05:31.317 --> 05:33.418
- Hang in there, okay?
- We're gonna get you out.

05:36.823 --> 05:39.323
Otis, hurry up with the
rest of that cribbing!

05:42.462 --> 05:44.128
Yo, back off.

05:46.699 --> 05:48.366
Hey, back off!

05:53.740 --> 05:55.139
- Keep it moving.
- All right. All right.

05:55.175 --> 05:56.340
Take it easy.

05:59.045 --> 06:00.645
[grunts]

06:02.382 --> 06:05.483
- What the hell?
- Lieutenant!

06:05.518 --> 06:08.052
I'm fine. Deal with this.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.989
I'm so sorry.

06:12.025 --> 06:14.125
Yeah, okay. Just keep moving.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.632
- We're good.
- Coming in.

06:21.668 --> 06:23.367
Cruz, let's score this.

06:28.341 --> 06:31.342
[glass clinking]

06:33.746 --> 06:34.812
Good!

06:34.848 --> 06:35.813
Let's roll him on Chili's three.

06:35.849 --> 06:38.850
One, two, three.

06:40.854 --> 06:44.155
Onto the backboard on
three. One, two, three.

06:47.227 --> 06:49.494
Ready? One, two, three.

07:05.645 --> 07:08.479
- Define traffic control.
- I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.681
There was this kid, and he
was trying to take a picture.

07:10.717 --> 07:13.384
Next time, stick to your post.

07:14.921 --> 07:17.555
Yes, sir.

07:17.590 --> 07:21.559
Hoo, Captain R-F-C must be
crushed he missed a photo op.

07:21.594 --> 07:24.195
You an officer, Otis?

07:24.230 --> 07:26.230
- No, sir.
- Then keep your mouth shut.

07:26.266 --> 07:28.533
It's a captain you're talking about.

07:41.114 --> 07:43.581
- Dawson, how you doing?
- Good, Captain.

07:43.616 --> 07:45.316
How is it being back?

07:48.054 --> 07:49.954
Fine.

07:49.989 --> 07:53.424
Job can be difficult following a trauma.

07:53.459 --> 07:54.425
If that's a question,

07:54.460 --> 07:56.260
respectfully, I decline to answer.

07:56.296 --> 07:59.697
There something I'm unaware of here?

07:59.732 --> 08:00.731
Just want to make sure my words

08:00.767 --> 08:03.701
don't come back to bite me.

08:03.736 --> 08:06.170
Did I do something to put you off?

08:06.205 --> 08:09.273
Let's just say the trust
factor around here...

08:09.309 --> 08:10.474
It's been higher.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.813
Excuse me.

08:21.888 --> 08:24.388
What's the latest on Severide's suspension?

08:24.424 --> 08:25.656
Anybody hear anything?

08:25.692 --> 08:28.392
Last time I checked, one
shift meant one shift.

08:28.428 --> 08:29.927
Yeah, but, like, one shift one shift?

08:29.963 --> 08:32.797
Or does it extend to all CFD events?

08:32.832 --> 08:36.333
Uh-uh, forget that. I told
you and Cruz last year,

08:36.369 --> 08:38.736
- Trawling Tradition's over with.
- What's that?

08:38.770 --> 08:41.272
Every gala, Cruz and Otis
follow around Severide,

08:41.307 --> 08:43.039
and chase after the girls in his wake.

08:43.076 --> 08:45.876
Enough feeding on
Severide's crumbs, all right?

08:45.912 --> 08:49.580
Otis, there's got to be
somebody you want to bring.

08:54.387 --> 08:56.754
Hey, there he is.

08:56.789 --> 08:59.390
Starting to worry about you, Chief.

08:59.425 --> 09:01.892
Can I have a word with you
and Mouch in my office, please?

09:03.329 --> 09:06.564
- Yeah.
- Casey.

09:17.510 --> 09:19.644
I swear on my child's
life, I didn't do this.

09:19.679 --> 09:23.614
Given your reputation, they
got to know this is nuts.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.282
Truth is, I don't know
what to do from here.

09:25.318 --> 09:27.351
Your first call is your union steward.

09:27.387 --> 09:29.553
- I'll handle that.
- Got a lawyer, Chief?

09:29.589 --> 09:32.556
- I didn't do nothing wrong.
- All the more reason.

09:35.862 --> 09:37.061
Ashley Daniels.

09:37.096 --> 09:38.663
She's Cindy's best friend from childhood.

09:38.698 --> 09:40.998
She's a high-powered
criminal defense attorney.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.434
Cindy'll give her a call,
get you in right away.

09:45.138 --> 09:47.672
Thanks.

09:47.707 --> 09:51.342
That's two to you, Cruz.

09:51.377 --> 09:53.744
Joey Cruz.

09:53.780 --> 09:58.149
Hey, there he is. I'm glad you came.

09:58.184 --> 09:59.617
I didn't have nothing better to do

09:59.652 --> 10:01.085
and you said come, so you know, I came.

10:02.522 --> 10:03.621
This is who I was telling you guys about...

10:03.656 --> 10:06.123
Freddie Clemente, Leon's boy.

10:06.159 --> 10:08.392
Hey, I'll meet you inside in a sec, okay?

10:08.428 --> 10:09.593
Okay.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.900
Um, I, uh...

10:15.935 --> 10:17.234
I just wanted to say thank you

10:17.270 --> 10:19.403
for letting Freddie spend
some time in the house.

10:19.439 --> 10:20.871
Means a lot to me.

10:20.907 --> 10:23.274
Yeah, well, sometimes
people need a hand up.

10:25.478 --> 10:27.311
Thanks again.

10:32.318 --> 10:34.018
I know it's a delicate question.

10:34.053 --> 10:36.253
Were there any relations with Ms. Holmes?

10:36.289 --> 10:39.523
Serena Holmes was my
neighbor, nothing more.

10:39.559 --> 10:41.959
Okay, I have to ask...

10:41.994 --> 10:45.496
The reason being that a surprise
on the stand can be fatal.

10:45.531 --> 10:48.365
The circumstantial
evidence is pretty damning.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.401
She picked you out of a photo array,

10:50.436 --> 10:52.303
and your boot print's on her front door.

10:52.338 --> 10:54.371
Have they looked into this woman?

10:54.407 --> 10:58.175
I mean, she targeted my
husband, fabricated an assault.

10:58.211 --> 11:00.044
There's no way she got crazy overnight.

11:00.079 --> 11:01.912
It'll all come out, Donna.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.547
Now, is there anyone who can corroborate

11:03.583 --> 11:06.383
your version of the events?

11:06.419 --> 11:08.419
I was alone at the time.

11:08.454 --> 11:09.754
You need to know,

11:09.789 --> 11:12.156
because you admitted to
kicking in Ms. Holmes' door,

11:12.191 --> 11:14.759
Detective Wheeler is
pushing to upgrade the charge

11:14.794 --> 11:17.261
from aggravated battery to home invasion.

11:17.296 --> 11:19.797
- Meaning?
- If convicted,

11:19.832 --> 11:23.300
instead of 3-5 years,
you're looking at 30.

11:26.839 --> 11:28.472
[exhales sharply]

11:37.321 --> 11:38.888
[knock on door]

11:38.923 --> 11:40.122
81's incident report for that last call.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.691
Thank you.

11:41.726 --> 11:43.960
Matt, I appreciate you
getting my back with Otis.

11:45.897 --> 11:48.331
Chain of command, that's all.

11:48.366 --> 11:50.032
Appreciated nonetheless.

11:54.252 --> 11:57.153
The confrontation with Severide...

11:57.188 --> 11:59.922
It warrants a formal report?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.657
That's why I wrote it up.

12:04.629 --> 12:06.562
He threatened me with physical violence.

I could have charged him
with conduct unbecoming.

That's not what he said.

My loyalty is to the job...
being the best officer I can.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.080
That's why I told Severide

12:24.115 --> 12:25.781

knocking him on his ass.

About 20 years back I get in this beef

12:51.275 --> 12:54.944
with Billy Ryman, Engine Lieutenant on 36.

12:54.979 --> 12:56.679
He starts squawking to the Battalion Chief.

"Benny's been ghost payrolling," he says.

working, but he's never there."

13:05.490 --> 13:07.256
Which was true.

Joe's kid had cancer. He's
where he should have been.

13:10.795 --> 13:13.496
Let me guess. You went ballistic.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.098
Well, I called one of my buddies at CPD

13:16.134 --> 13:17.867
and had Ryman tailed home.

13:17.902 --> 13:20.469
Turns out he was living in the suburbs.

13:20.505 --> 13:23.773
Didn't want to relocate after
getting hired by the city.

13:23.808 --> 13:27.711
A week later, he got axed
for falsifying his residence.

13:33.217 --> 13:36.552
I turned over a couple
rocks on Captain Patterson.

13:36.587 --> 13:40.523

before, just stay out of it.
