Or just your side hustle?

00:38.097 --> 00:39.347
Hmm, the silent type, eh?

00:40.460 --> 00:42.060
That's how I like my men anyway.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.274
Wanna be my boyfriend?

00:46.275 --> 00:48.607
Uh.

00:48.608 --> 00:49.600
Ah. - Oopsy.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.600
- Jeez.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
Boy,

00:59.290 --> 01:00.433
you look thirsty.

01:01.610 --> 01:02.610
Here,

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
have some water.

01:05.850 --> 01:06.850
- I'm good, thanks.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.783
I insist.

01:17.130 --> 01:20.139
So what are your
plans for the night?

01:20.140 --> 01:21.615
Anything

01:21.616 --> 01:22.616
special?

01:24.739 --> 01:27.900
- Um, you know, just the uje.

01:27.901 --> 01:29.068
How 'bout you?

01:30.067 --> 01:32.083
A little bit of this,

01:33.540 --> 01:34.830
and a little bit of that.

01:36.424 --> 01:37.424
- Total.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.523
This taste kinda funny.

02:17.796 --> 02:19.065
It should.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.804
I said it should, shouldn't it?

02:22.805 --> 02:23.638
- Um,

02:23.639 --> 02:24.709
no.

02:24.710 --> 02:25.710
Why?

02:28.420 --> 02:30.486
It's an off-brand.

02:30.487 --> 02:31.487
- Oh.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.159
Oh, look at that.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160
Here we are.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.333
Have a good night.

02:50.790 --> 02:51.949
- Yeah,

02:51.950 --> 02:52.950
you too.

03:02.571 --> 03:04.904
- Uh, can you, please, un...

03:06.427 --> 03:07.427
Help me, mm.

03:19.793 --> 03:21.926
- You just have to push it.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.413
Hard. - Okay.

03:25.264 --> 03:26.264
Thanks.

03:32.536 --> 03:33.923
Wait, Alissa?

03:35.741 --> 03:37.125
You forgot something.

03:37.126 --> 03:38.185
- What is...

04:05.868 --> 04:08.159
I live in Hollywood.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.169
It's a shit hole.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.379
People come here from
all over the world

04:12.380 --> 04:14.429
just to be disappointed.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.918
Dreamers move here to
accomplish their dreams,

04:17.920 --> 04:21.349
and end up
accomplishing nothing.

04:21.350 --> 04:24.019
The only honest thing
about this place

04:24.020 --> 04:25.353
is the dishonesty.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.089
The boulevard of broken dreams.

04:29.090 --> 04:32.579
People trying to deceive
you at every corner.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.019
Tourist traps out the yang.

04:35.020 --> 04:38.069
The only place where you can
see all the super heroes.

04:38.070 --> 04:42.653
Vader, Sponge Bob, all sucking
off the teet of society.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.689
They're the true winners.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.529
They're they only
so-called actors

04:47.530 --> 04:48.830
that are actually working.

04:49.796 --> 04:52.673
Schmucks give 'em five
bucks a pop for a pic.

04:53.810 --> 04:54.810
Good for them.

06:09.007 --> 06:10.069
- Hi, there.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.509
Jason, correct?

06:11.510 --> 06:12.679
Yes.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.350
Okay, this is our first time.

06:16.490 --> 06:17.667
Well, at this anyway.

06:20.851 --> 06:22.329
I'm kiddin' around.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.163
I'm kiddin' around.

06:23.164 --> 06:25.599
- I had a half a glass of vino
before I got in your car.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
- I had the other half.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.899
We don't normally do that.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.419
- No.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.489
- It was good wine.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.849
Really good.

06:33.850 --> 06:34.740
From a box.

06:34.741 --> 06:35.949
- Yeah.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.730
So how do you like driving?

06:40.810 --> 06:42.949
- Oh, my God, please
tell us some stories.

06:42.950 --> 06:43.800
What do you mean?

06:43.801 --> 06:45.479
- Any weirdos, you
ever get any weirdos

06:45.480 --> 06:46.649
in the car? - Yeah, yeah.

06:46.650 --> 06:47.720
All the time.

06:49.544 --> 06:51.569
- Tell me, tell me,
tell me, I wanna know.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.403
Normally?

06:52.404 --> 06:53.614
- Normally or weirdly.

06:54.890 --> 06:55.890
- Well.
- Tell us.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.439
- When that happens,

06:59.440 --> 07:00.440
if they're

07:01.750 --> 07:03.409
weird. - Ah.

07:03.410 --> 07:04.669
- Or annoying.

07:04.670 --> 07:05.503
- Right.

07:05.504 --> 07:06.584
I hate those people.

07:06.585 --> 07:07.538
- I, - Oh, my God,

07:07.539 --> 07:09.085
Tell us, tell us.
- Tell us, tell us,

07:09.086 --> 07:10.166
tell us, you gotta tell us.

07:11.545 --> 07:13.378
I kill them.

07:20.487 --> 07:21.487
- Oh,

07:22.878 --> 07:24.859
you really had me. - Oh, my God.

07:24.860 --> 07:25.902
- Oh, my gosh.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.423
- That freaked me out.
- That was good.

07:28.021 --> 07:29.712
I really thought
you killed people.

07:29.713 --> 07:31.489
Wow.

07:31.490 --> 07:32.799
That was good. - That was good.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.299
Have you done any acting?

07:34.300 --> 07:35.459
'Cause you could be good.

07:35.460 --> 07:36.509
- Yeah.
- Would you like

07:36.510 --> 07:38.180
to hear a joke?

07:40.353 --> 07:41.353
Yes.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.090
- He's 100% blind.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.410
- Hmm.
- I can't see a thing.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.560
No, but seriously, I'd
love to hear a joke.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.509
A man walks into a bar.

07:51.510 --> 07:52.839
- Mm, been there.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.599
He's like, wow,

07:54.600 --> 07:58.809
there's so many beautiful
women in this bar.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.799
So he goes up to the bar,

08:00.800 --> 08:03.263
and there's a man
sitting at the bar,

08:04.470 --> 08:06.219
and he says to the man,

08:06.220 --> 08:07.220
hey, buddy,

08:07.940 --> 08:11.503
do you see all these beautiful
women here at this bar?

08:12.530 --> 08:14.279
And the man says,

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
yes,

08:16.150 --> 08:17.419
and in fact,

08:17.420 --> 08:19.269
I can have sex

08:19.270 --> 08:21.633
with any women in this bar.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.649
Now the man looks at
him weird and says,

08:26.650 --> 08:27.863
hold on a minute,

08:29.170 --> 08:31.159
what makes you think
you can have sex

08:31.160 --> 08:33.602
with any women in this bar?

08:34.722 --> 08:38.023
And the man takes a drink
and looks at him and says,

08:39.640 --> 08:41.293
because I'm a rapist.

08:48.608 --> 08:49.608
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.609 --> 08:52.659
Yeah.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.959
You know what I could
see you doing?

08:54.960 --> 08:58.029
Hosting one of those
murder mystery shows,

08:58.030 --> 08:59.169
where you give that deadpan

08:59.170 --> 09:00.459
the whole time. - Yeah.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.209
- Oh, I, I could totally

09:02.210 --> 09:03.649
do something like that.

09:03.650 --> 09:04.483
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

09:04.483 --> 09:05.316
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:05.317 --> 09:06.357
- I mean, my husband here

09:06.358 --> 09:07.798
can point you in the
right direction

09:07.822 --> 09:09.949
'cause he does improv
every Saturday night

09:09.950 --> 09:11.091
at the Yuks Yard.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.099
- Guilty, guilty.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.089
The Yuks Yard?

09:15.090 --> 09:17.259
Sounds like a real hootenanny.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.749
- It really is.
- It is.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.110
- You know, we have
a whole troop.

09:20.134 --> 09:22.029
- Yeah.
- Um, for instance,

09:22.030 --> 09:25.929
this one time we had about
14 of us in the group.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.219
- Oh, my God, so funny.
- And we started doing.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.238
Yuk you.

09:29.239 --> 09:30.440
Oh.

09:30.441 --> 09:31.390
- Oh.

09:31.391 --> 09:33.469
Would you look at that?

09:33.470 --> 09:34.340
We're here.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.469
- Wow, yeah, that was fast.

09:36.470 --> 09:37.579
Thank you. - Mm.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.220
- You should totally
come tomorrow night.

09:39.244 --> 09:40.219
- It's totally free.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.759
- Yeah, it's just a
two drink minimum.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.779
- Mm-hmm, and parking
is $20 dollars,

09:43.780 --> 09:46.229
but it's from from 9 to ten,

09:46.230 --> 09:47.929
so if you move your
car then you're fine,

09:47.930 --> 09:49.410
but hang onto your
ticket if you park

09:49.411 --> 09:50.381
in the lot across the street

09:50.382 --> 09:53.019
because if you lose it's a
$100 dollars which is crazy.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.239
And I made that
mistake twice, so.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.389
Yeah, it's $220 to get
it out of impound.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.223
- Yeah.
- Which they

09:58.223 --> 09:59.056
will do to you.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.189
- Yeah.
- Sounds

10:00.190 --> 10:01.669
like a plan.

10:01.670 --> 10:02.859
- Good, okay.
- Great.

10:02.860 --> 10:03.800
- Alright, we'll
see you tomorrow.

10:03.801 --> 10:06.189
- Yuks Yard, 8 o'clock.
- Yes, see you tomorrow.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.769
- See you tomorrow, thank you.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.839
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.690
Bye, Jason.

10:10.691 --> 10:13.200
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

10:18.590 --> 10:20.853
I'd rather set myself on fire.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.857
- Headed on over
to my lady's pad.

10:30.858 --> 10:32.279
- Mm.
- Well,

10:32.280 --> 10:33.713
gonna Netflix and chill.

10:33.714 --> 10:35.579
If you know what I mean?

10:35.580 --> 10:37.890
Oh, I know exactly

10:38.730 --> 10:39.989
what you mean.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.682
- Good, good.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.319
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.429
We'll, ah, you know, we'll
probably just hang out,

10:46.430 --> 10:48.889
cook some dinner, maybe
catch a flick, you know?

10:48.890 --> 10:51.439
Sounds like a blast.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.877
You gotta please the ladies.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.039
Am I right?

10:54.040 --> 10:55.689
Yes, indeed.

10:55.690 --> 10:56.729
Yes, indeed.

10:56.730 --> 10:57.809
Exceedingly

10:57.810 --> 10:58.810
so.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.113
She doesn't deserve it.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.709
What?

11:06.710 --> 11:08.653
- You said, she
doesn't deserve it.

11:09.980 --> 11:13.459
Oh, I'm not talking
about anybody.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.460
Am I?

11:15.432 --> 11:16.432
- Hmm.

11:20.660 --> 11:21.963
So, ah,

11:23.330 --> 11:25.871
you married, Mr.,

11:25.872 --> 11:27.399
Mr.,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.319
Mr. Jason?

11:29.320 --> 11:30.699
No.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.533
Single.

11:31.534 --> 11:33.203
- Hah, that's the
way it should be.

11:34.750 --> 11:35.799
Any kids?

11:35.800 --> 11:38.069
I just said I was single, moron.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.519
- Oh, okay.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.460
I mean...

11:40.461 --> 11:41.710
You mean, what?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.160
- You can still have
kids and be single.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.223
I have two boys.

11:50.130 --> 11:51.679
Two

11:51.680 --> 11:53.173
little boys.

11:54.911 --> 11:55.969
- Cool.

11:55.970 --> 11:57.193
Cool beans.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.762
How 'bout you?

11:59.763 --> 12:00.862
- Uh, nah.

12:00.863 --> 12:02.213
Nah, just a girlfriend.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.179
Well, good for you.

12:05.180 --> 12:07.179
- Yeah, uh-huh, or at least

12:07.180 --> 12:09.779
she thinks she's my girlfriend.

12:09.780 --> 12:10.969
Go on.

12:10.970 --> 12:13.769
- I mean, don't get me wrong.

12:13.770 --> 12:14.873
I'm a monogamous guy.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.389
But?

12:17.390 --> 12:19.319
- A red-blooded, American male.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.819
Meaning?

12:20.820 --> 12:24.789
- I mean, guys, you know,
we're not monogamous.

12:24.790 --> 12:25.790
By our nature.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.758
Hmm.

12:27.759 --> 12:28.759
If you say so.

12:30.290 --> 12:31.773
- Oh, yeah, right here.

12:33.936 --> 12:34.986
Right here's perfect.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.579
Hey, have a good night, man.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.570
You too.

12:38.571 --> 12:41.720
Have fun with your girlfriend
or whatever she is.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.291
If you say so.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.899
No, I'm kidding, man.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.329
I'm kidding, have a good one.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.011
You have to, ah, push one it.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.012
Hard.

12:54.061 --> 12:55.719
- Got it.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.948
Hey, ah, if you're
not busy later,

12:58.949 --> 12:59.949
can you

13:00.620 --> 13:02.245
pick me up

13:02.246 --> 13:03.313
at this address?

13:05.260 --> 13:06.713
Say at like 10?

13:08.150 --> 13:09.150
Can you do that?

13:13.230 --> 13:14.740
Um, I don't know.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.429
I'm not sure. - Uh.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.930
I'll make it worth your while.

13:21.270 --> 13:22.529
Okay.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.030
- Alright, I'll see you there.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.669
Oh, my God, hi, are you Jason?

13:39.670 --> 13:41.129
Yes, get in.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.509
- Oh, hi, Jason.

13:42.510 --> 13:44.549
Wow, that is so funny.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.729
I have a cousin named Jason.

13:46.730 --> 13:48.050
He doesn't look
like you, though.

13:48.074 --> 13:50.067
Oh, small world.

13:50.729 --> 13:51.899
- Hey, buckle up.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.579
- I'm okay, he looks
like a safe driver.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.670
- Fine, have it your way.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.729
Last time I saw
my cousin, Jason,

14:00.730 --> 14:03.319
we were in Fiji,
weren't we, honey?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.599
- Uh-huh.
- So we

14:04.600 --> 14:07.049
went to Fiji and,
oh, my goodness.

14:07.050 --> 14:10.219
The water and everything,
it was so gorgeous.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.919
We went on this excursion,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.239
and our tour guide was this
cute little Asian man.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.279
He had a little rice picker hat.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.861
It was just adorable.

14:17.862 --> 14:19.019
I could car less where

14:19.020 --> 14:22.339
you went with your
cousin, Jason, bitch.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.779
Wow,

14:23.780 --> 14:25.706
congratulations.

14:25.707 --> 14:27.719
Him and a few million
other American men

14:27.720 --> 14:29.779
are all named Jason.

14:29.780 --> 14:32.909
How can this dude put up
with this mindless broad?

14:32.910 --> 14:34.759
Look at him on his phone.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.459
He's probably on a
dating app trying

14:36.460 --> 14:39.939
to find other women to fool
around with in his spare time.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.543
If he has any spare time.

14:42.430 --> 14:43.749
What a moron.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.459
- And my mother inherited
my grandmother's ring,

14:46.460 --> 14:47.679
and I'll tell you what,

14:47.680 --> 14:50.299
it was not a small
ring, it is huge,

14:50.300 --> 14:52.140
and she was gonna give
it to me for my wedding,

14:52.164 --> 14:54.499
but I told her, no, it's better
off if my sister takes it.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.769
So my sister has it.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.349
What a great idea.

14:57.350 --> 15:00.039
Two meaningless zoo
animals getting together

15:00.040 --> 15:02.609
to live a fantasy dream.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.610
What a nightmare.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.889
How can this idiot
handle being with her?

15:07.890 --> 15:09.499
She's babbling.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.660
- And a lotta people say that

15:10.684 --> 15:13.009
was a really humble
thing to do on my part,

15:13.010 --> 15:15.402
but that's just who
I am as a person.

15:15.403 --> 15:16.529
I bet even if

15:16.530 --> 15:18.329
I don't say another word,

15:18.330 --> 15:19.330
she'll continue on

15:20.152 --> 15:21.152
and on

15:21.773 --> 15:22.773
and on.

15:22.774 --> 15:24.149
- I love giving to charities

15:24.150 --> 15:26.719
and animal rights,
that's like my passion.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.969
I think it's just so disgusting
what they do to those geese.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.869
You know, to get their,
what do you call it?

15:31.870 --> 15:33.379
The, the down feathers?

15:33.380 --> 15:34.689
Ooh, that's disgusting.

15:34.690 --> 15:36.359
Isn't it disgusting, babe?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.499
- Yeah,

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
right.

15:40.490 --> 15:41.490
I'm listening, babe.

15:41.491 --> 15:42.621
It's disgusting.

15:42.622 --> 15:44.304
- You're shittin'
right, it's disgusting.

15:44.305 --> 15:45.505
Ooh.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.439
Wait a minute.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.899
Where are we?

15:49.900 --> 15:51.640
- I had to stop for a moment.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.610
Can you believe this, honey?

15:57.410 --> 15:59.319
- My apologies.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.370
I have to get something
out of the trunk.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.803
Thank you for being patient.

16:04.820 --> 16:08.963
You both seem like two
very patient individuals.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.763
Especially you, Susie.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.290
- Go.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.543
It's totally cool.

16:18.650 --> 16:19.969
I'm very patient.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.379
I am patient.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.080
It's part of who I
am as a person.

16:32.210 --> 16:33.210
- Here,

16:34.280 --> 16:35.630
you both look very thirsty.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.199
Would you like some

16:38.200 --> 16:39.200
water?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.859
- Oh, thank you.

16:41.860 --> 16:42.909
How cute.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.139
Teeny tiny little water bottle.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.959
This kinda reminds me
of something, babe.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.710
Doesn't it remind
you of something?

16:49.700 --> 16:51.519
- Ha-ha, very funny.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.589
- That is funny.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.029
I'm so funny.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.359
Yeah, I said it,
said it was funny.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.409
- You know, I could
write a comedy sitcom

16:58.410 --> 17:00.399
and sell it to a network.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.429
I should take one of
those improv classes.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.799
Uh, I could do standup.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.378
I bet I would be so
good at standup.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.048
Wouldn't I be good?

17:08.049 --> 17:09.859
Ah, yeah.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.628
- Oh, no, you'd, you'd be good.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.138
- That's right.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.519
I'm way funnier then
that one fat bitch

17:17.520 --> 17:18.714
from the Comedy Channel.

17:23.983 --> 17:24.983
Mm, mm, mm.

17:24.983 --> 17:25.983
Mm-mm.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.706
Not one sip for you, young man.

17:28.707 --> 17:31.330
You take one sip you'll have to
pee pee time in two minutes.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.063
- So, we don't have any ti...

17:35.880 --> 17:37.026
Ow.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.489
Ow, what the hell?

17:39.490 --> 17:40.460
My stomach hurts.

17:40.461 --> 17:42.139
Are you okay?

17:42.140 --> 17:44.003
No, my stomach really hurts.

17:46.730 --> 17:47.730
- Thank you so much, - Ow.

17:47.730 --> 17:48.680
For being patient.

17:48.681 --> 17:50.408
- Yeah, no problem.

17:50.409 --> 17:51.752
- Ow, ow, ow,

17:51.753 --> 17:53.939
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
Are you okay?

17:55.670 --> 17:57.929
- Yeah, it's just my...

17:57.930 --> 17:58.930
- Don't worry.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.494
You'll be home soon.

18:02.495 --> 18:03.745
- Ow, ow.
- Shh.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.654
Be quiet, we'll be home soon.

18:10.095 --> 18:11.245
- Shh.
- My stomach hurts.

18:11.246 --> 18:12.499
It's probably the shellfish.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.869
It's not the shellfish.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.409
- You had shellfish,

18:15.410 --> 18:16.649
your stomach doesn't hurt.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.757
- That's cause I'm not
shellfish like you.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.409
- Not funny.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.789
I'm sorry.

18:22.790 --> 18:23.889
- Ow.

18:23.890 --> 18:24.810
The water.

18:24.811 --> 18:25.891
I just took a sip of water.

18:25.915 --> 18:26.665
It's the water.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.449
- Susie,

18:28.450 --> 18:30.609
water doesn't make
your stomach hurt.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.169
- Yes, it does.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.223
- That doesn't make
any sense, here look.

18:37.130 --> 18:38.630
No, no, don't do it.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.660
No.

18:41.456 --> 18:44.512
No.

18:44.513 --> 18:45.659
Ow.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.699
It's fine, we're fine.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.700
- Ow, ow, ow.

18:49.470 --> 18:51.227
I think he drugged the water.

18:53.190 --> 18:54.283
- You're ridiculous.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.444
I just took a big
gulp and I feel fine.

18:58.445 --> 18:59.539
Hey, driver?

18:59.540 --> 19:02.053
You didn't drug the
water, did you?

19:02.054 --> 19:03.559
Me?

19:03.560 --> 19:06.039
- No, the other driver that's
driving us around right now.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.139
Huh, you are so smart.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.929
Did you or didn't you?

19:10.930 --> 19:12.569
I would do nothing of the sort.

19:12.570 --> 19:15.210
- See honey, he would
do nothing of the sort.

19:16.700 --> 19:17.700
- Ow.

19:19.020 --> 19:20.579
My stomach.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.580
See?

19:22.740 --> 19:24.779
- Ah, it's gotta
be the shellfish.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.219
- It's not, you're an idiot.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.013
Oh, my God, it's the water.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.923
- It's finally digesting.

19:31.783 --> 19:32.783
- That's it.

19:32.784 --> 19:34.160
I am calling the cops.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.789
Yes, I'd like to
report an emergency.

19:38.790 --> 19:41.899
My boyfriend and I have been
drugged by our Hitch driver.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.669
I haven't done anything.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.069
- Susie.
- Yes, we live,

19:45.070 --> 19:46.099
uh, yes.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.319
Um. - Susie, you're

19:47.320 --> 19:49.282
overreacting. - Ooh.

19:49.283 --> 19:50.116
Give me your phone.

19:50.117 --> 19:51.477
- No, I'm not giving
you my phone.

19:51.501 --> 19:53.309
Get outta here.
- Quit being shellfish.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.069
- It's not funny dude.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.239
- Yes, yes, yes.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.439
Um,

19:57.440 --> 19:58.273
yes, he's drugged us.

19:58.274 --> 19:59.394
Get off. - Give me the phone.

19:59.395 --> 20:00.345
- My boyfriend is trying

20:00.346 --> 20:01.993
to rape me. - Give me the phone.

20:01.994 --> 20:05.226
- I live at 407
Highland Hills, please.

20:05.227 --> 20:06.227
- Give me the phone.

20:09.830 --> 20:10.999
Is she okay?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.183
She'll be fine.

20:13.650 --> 20:15.483
My stomach really
does hurt, though.

20:16.398 --> 20:18.213
It's probably the shellfish.

25:26.370 --> 25:27.499
Oh, wow, hi.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.679
- Hello there.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.309
- It's weird, I thought
you were farther.

25:31.310 --> 25:33.455
- The app does that sometimes.

25:33.456 --> 25:34.360
- Oh,

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
okay.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.750
- Here's your Hawaiian
veggie burger.

25:40.067 --> 25:41.645
- The app told me.

25:41.646 --> 25:42.479
- Oh,

25:42.480 --> 25:43.589
duh.

25:43.590 --> 25:45.345
Okay, thanks, bye.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.820
- Yeah,

25:52.821 --> 25:54.339
no.

25:54.340 --> 25:56.709
My place isn't really
like fit for that.

25:56.710 --> 25:58.309
- I'm sure it's not,

25:58.310 --> 26:00.149
but it'll be real quick.

26:00.150 --> 26:01.380
I really have to

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
urinate.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
Pretty please?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.169
- Yeah,

26:16.170 --> 26:17.399
sure.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.803
Um, just excuse the mess.

26:19.880 --> 26:20.999
And be quick.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.843
- Oh, it will only
take a minute.

26:40.411 --> 26:41.828
Alright.

26:43.298 --> 26:44.381
Come to mama.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.188
Mm-hmm.

26:49.609 --> 26:50.881
Mm.

27:02.168 --> 27:03.288
Yeah.

27:11.402 --> 27:12.402
Shit.

30:34.629 --> 30:35.629
- Uh, aw.

30:52.065 --> 30:53.065
- Shit.

31:19.839 --> 31:21.482
Shut up, shut up you mutt.

31:24.248 --> 31:25.248
Piffin?

31:30.390 --> 31:31.390
Piffin?

31:44.500 --> 31:45.500
Piffin?

31:47.554 --> 31:48.554
Hmm.

32:22.128 --> 32:23.172
Oh, hi.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.149
I don't believe I've ever
seen you around here.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.288
Excuse me, I have to get by.

32:26.289 --> 32:27.253
Well, why are you so nervous?

32:27.254 --> 32:29.009
- I have, I've got a rider,

32:29.010 --> 32:30.049
I'm gonna be late.

32:30.050 --> 32:31.450
Really, how...
- I'm a Hitch driver.

32:31.451 --> 32:32.284
- Oh, that explains everything.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.622
Leave me alone.

32:34.623 --> 32:35.623
- Fine.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
- Dude.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.219
What the hell took you so long?

33:15.220 --> 33:16.210
I apologize.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.579
I was caught up.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.139
- Well, you're gonna make
me late for my show.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.769
Again, I, I apologize.

33:21.770 --> 33:22.816
I'm, I'm sorry.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.879
- Well, step on it.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.979
Um, we will get there
safe and sound.

33:29.980 --> 33:32.029
Without getting a ticket.

33:32.030 --> 33:34.699
- It's okay, my
followers can wait.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.480
Your followers?

33:38.860 --> 33:39.860
Know what?

33:45.466 --> 33:46.466
Spankie?

33:47.460 --> 33:50.459
- I'm Spankie
frickin' Valentine.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.749
Oh.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.129
So you're a porn star?

33:53.130 --> 33:54.459
- Wow.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.460
Because that would make sense.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.047
- No.

34:16.047 --> 34:19.433
For your information,
I'm a musician.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.989
Oh, a musician.

34:20.989 --> 34:21.989
That's rare.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.619
Especially in LA.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.659
- Oh, and it's so rare you being

34:26.659 --> 34:29.987
a Hitch driver in
LA, now isn't it?

34:29.989 --> 34:34.478
I, I was just kidding with you.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.369
What type of music
do you perform?

34:37.370 --> 34:39.060
I'm intrigued.

34:39.061 --> 34:39.920
- Oh,

34:39.920 --> 34:40.753
well,

34:40.753 --> 34:41.699
I,

34:41.701 --> 34:42.748
I do pop

34:42.750 --> 34:43.690
and rock

34:43.690 --> 34:44.523
and

34:44.523 --> 34:45.420
hip hop.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.909
Pretty much any style,
I like to do it all.

34:47.909 --> 34:50.070
Wow, I'm impressed.

34:51.699 --> 34:52.978
Thank you so

34:52.980 --> 34:54.359
much.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.592
You're welcome so much.

35:01.098 --> 35:02.098
What about me?

35:02.099 --> 35:04.642
- I don't know, do you
play any instruments?

35:04.643 --> 35:08.249
I, I used to, not anymore.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.919
- Okay, so, what instrument
did you used to play?

35:11.920 --> 35:12.753
- Well...
- Wa, wa, wa,

35:12.753 --> 35:13.586
wa, wa, wait.

35:13.586 --> 35:14.430
Let me guess, let me guess.

35:14.431 --> 35:15.629
I got this.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.963
You were totally in a
marching band, right?

35:19.130 --> 35:20.499
You figured me out.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.369
- I know, it's, it's
totally normal.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.379
Kids like you do the whole
marching band scene, I get it.

35:25.380 --> 35:28.203
What do you mean, kids like me?

35:29.810 --> 35:32.012
- I, I'm not trying to be mean.

35:32.013 --> 35:33.189
Oh, no, don't worry.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.599
You won't offend me.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.743
- Well, you know, like, nerdy.

35:40.060 --> 35:41.939
Guilty as charged.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.519
- Hey, I mean, nerds
rule the world.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.510
Really, so true. - Yes, they do.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.239
- Like, I was totally
just talking

35:47.240 --> 35:48.499
to my boyfriend about this.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.649
Oh.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.053
You have a boyfriend.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.429
- Yes.

35:53.430 --> 35:55.604
Oh, that's too bad.

35:57.687 --> 36:00.489
Means you can't have any fun.

36:00.490 --> 36:02.119
- Oh, honey,

36:02.120 --> 36:05.409
I have more fun than you
could possibly imagine.

36:05.410 --> 36:06.350
Really, now?

36:06.351 --> 36:08.899
- Yeah, especially,

36:08.900 --> 36:10.739
I love

36:10.740 --> 36:13.189
hitting on hot Hitch drivers

36:13.190 --> 36:14.339
just

36:14.340 --> 36:15.509
like

36:15.510 --> 36:16.510
you.

36:18.370 --> 36:21.363
- Whatever.

36:22.410 --> 36:25.169
- Oh, come one, I
almost had you there.

36:25.170 --> 36:26.649
No, not really.

36:26.650 --> 36:30.059
- Oh, come on, you
would have wanted to.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.969
Wanted to what, exactly?

36:31.970 --> 36:32.970
- You know.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.199
It's alright, most guys do.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.349
Wow, you're so modest.

36:38.350 --> 36:39.629
- Well, I mean, when you have

36:39.630 --> 36:41.259
like a couple million followers

36:41.260 --> 36:44.749
and 90% of them are guys,
it's kinda hard not to be.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.429
Does your boyfriend know?

36:46.430 --> 36:49.379
- My boyfriend totally
knows my demographic.

36:49.380 --> 36:51.449
In fact, he encourages

36:51.450 --> 36:54.819
flirtation and that I wear,
you know, like sexy outfits.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.709
It means more merch sales.

36:56.710 --> 37:00.063
Aren't you worried
about security?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.799
- Nah.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.300
That's why I got this bad boy.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.290
Hmm.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.539
Here,

37:08.540 --> 37:10.669
have some of this.

37:10.670 --> 37:11.670
- I'm okay.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.709
No, I insist.

37:14.710 --> 37:15.710
- I'm good.

37:16.670 --> 37:18.939
You should really
have some water

37:18.940 --> 37:20.860
before your concert.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.260
Teach me what?

37:27.890 --> 37:28.919
This isn't candy.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.423
Same difference.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.099
Whatever you want.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.593
- That's usually how it goes.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.818
- I was only playing.

37:50.819 --> 37:51.819
Hmm.

37:53.550 --> 37:55.999
- Oh, my gosh, I love this song.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.753
Don't you love this song?

40:47.237 --> 40:50.539
I was worried about you.

40:52.812 --> 40:55.979
- You weren't
answering my texts.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.163
- My apologies.

40:59.430 --> 41:01.309
I was busy.

41:01.310 --> 41:02.893
Taking care of things.

41:07.075 --> 41:08.340
- Come to bed.

41:45.571 --> 41:48.299
- I have to be going.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.300
Soon.

41:55.069 --> 41:56.084
- Come here.

42:10.539 --> 42:11.539
Uh-huh.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.934
What's gotten into you?

42:29.935 --> 42:30.935
I like it.

43:23.933 --> 43:24.933
Yes.

43:24.934 --> 43:26.730
- Yeah, alright, get in babe.

43:34.010 --> 43:35.010
Come over here.

43:35.011 --> 43:36.331
Give me some of
that sugar, baby.

43:36.355 --> 43:37.355
C'mon, mm,

43:37.961 --> 43:38.961
yeah.

43:39.915 --> 43:42.105
Mmm, baby.

43:42.106 --> 43:45.412
- Mm, days, babe, we
talkin' about nights.

43:47.950 --> 43:50.563
And Dave's gonna make you a
happy girl tonight, yeah.

43:59.660 --> 44:01.360
Okay, kids, here we are.

44:03.143 --> 44:07.667
Alright, c'mon, let's go, baby.

44:07.668 --> 44:09.251
C'mon, you alright.

44:11.340 --> 44:12.340
You alright.

44:12.341 --> 44:14.090
You alright, just
wait right there.

44:15.088 --> 44:17.459
Hey,

44:17.460 --> 44:19.155
here you go.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.873
This is a $50 dollar bill.

44:20.874 --> 44:22.319
- I know.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.009
I just, I need you to come back

44:24.010 --> 44:26.599
to that bar around
like, midnight.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.590
Don't have the app on.

44:27.591 --> 44:30.029
Alright, I'll just,
I'll be waiting.

44:30.030 --> 44:31.239
- Alright, okay.
- Hey, hey.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.560
- Sure, sure, okay.
- I'll make it

44:32.561 --> 44:33.481
worth your while.

44:33.482 --> 44:34.513
- Okay.
- Promise.

44:35.770 --> 44:36.770
Midnight.

44:36.770 --> 44:37.770
Midnight.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.393
Oh, great.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.199
Trace?

44:50.200 --> 44:51.429
Yeah.

44:51.430 --> 44:52.557
Get in.

44:52.558 --> 44:53.743
Thanks.

44:54.750 --> 44:56.329
It's cold out there, man.

44:56.330 --> 44:57.310
You keepin' it warm in here?

44:57.311 --> 44:58.543
Yes, I am.

44:59.540 --> 45:00.540
- Cool.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
Damn.

45:05.780 --> 45:07.229
- I don't know, you ever like,

45:07.230 --> 45:09.739
look up at the stars and

45:09.740 --> 45:12.429
think, you know, maybe
we're not alone?

45:12.430 --> 45:14.009
- Whenever I look up at the sky,

45:14.010 --> 45:15.239
I don't see anything.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.969
We live in LA, for chrissakes.

45:16.970 --> 45:18.050
- No, you know what I mean,

45:18.074 --> 45:19.449
like when you go
up in the hills,

45:19.450 --> 45:22.933
and you can get away from
all this and it's clear.

45:23.860 --> 45:26.719
Oh, you're talking about aliens?

45:26.720 --> 45:28.189
- Yeah, man.
- Oh, I think about

45:28.190 --> 45:29.679
them all the time.

45:29.680 --> 45:30.513
Really?

45:30.514 --> 45:31.719
No.

45:31.720 --> 45:33.629
- Well, NASA states
that there's hundreds

45:33.630 --> 45:37.349
of billions of galaxies
in the universe,

45:37.350 --> 45:41.129
and there's roughly the same
amount of habitable planets.

45:41.130 --> 45:42.120
Uh-huh.

45:42.121 --> 45:44.149
- Meaning, out of
hundreds of billions

45:44.150 --> 45:46.179
of planets in the
known universe,

45:46.180 --> 45:48.409
we're just one tiny spec.

45:48.410 --> 45:49.260
Uh-huh.

45:49.261 --> 45:52.409
- I mean, how can there not
be other live out there?

45:52.410 --> 45:54.009
Well, you make a valid point.

45:54.010 --> 45:55.130
What made you think of this?

45:55.154 --> 45:57.319
- I don't know, man.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.383
It's just been on my mind.

45:59.384 --> 46:01.190
Okay.

46:03.330 --> 46:04.330
Yes.

46:07.550 --> 46:08.550
Both.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.679
I have a brother who's

46:12.680 --> 46:15.239
a, a little bit older than me,

46:15.240 --> 46:17.143
and I have a sister
who's younger.

46:18.683 --> 46:19.683
- Cool.

46:19.683 --> 46:20.516
You guys get along?

46:20.517 --> 46:22.680
Well, sort of.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.930
Well, I mean, we
don't not get along.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.889
- I see.

46:27.890 --> 46:31.059
I mean, we all sort of
live our own lives.

46:31.060 --> 46:32.429
- I know what you mean.

46:32.430 --> 46:33.410
Oh?

46:33.411 --> 46:35.969
- Yeah, we're just all so busy.

46:35.970 --> 46:37.628
Exactly.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.229
You got any kids?

46:40.230 --> 46:42.559
I have two boys.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.480
Two

46:43.481 --> 46:45.399
little boys.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.459
- Nice,

46:46.460 --> 46:47.420
nice.

46:47.421 --> 46:49.689
What makes you ask?

46:49.690 --> 46:51.790
- I don't know, I'm
just curious, I guess.

46:53.856 --> 46:54.856
Question.

46:54.857 --> 46:56.560
Ah, here it comes.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.290
Wow, that's a really
personal question.

47:02.170 --> 47:05.669
- Sorry, man, I'm not meaning
to be personal or anything.

47:05.670 --> 47:08.299
I believe in God or a God.

47:08.300 --> 47:09.589
Good for you.

47:09.590 --> 47:10.822
Do you not believe?

47:10.823 --> 47:12.199
I mean, it's cool if you don't.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.719
I have, you know, friends
that are atheists.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.699
I was an atheist for awhile.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.853
I believe in the idea of a god,

47:19.690 --> 47:21.889
but I don't believe
there's some guy

47:21.890 --> 47:24.449
with a white beard
sittin' up in the clouds

47:24.450 --> 47:28.260
and sendin' people to
Hell for stupid reasons.

47:30.510 --> 47:34.325
Oh, you know, like,
jerkin' you gherkin'.

47:34.326 --> 47:35.329
- Huh,

47:35.330 --> 47:36.979
yeah, huh.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.459
I don't know man,
Heaven and Hell

47:38.460 --> 47:39.969
are a whole other topic for me.

47:39.970 --> 47:42.569
Now listen, let's
stick to aliens.

47:42.570 --> 47:43.689
- Sure.

47:43.690 --> 47:46.239
I mean, if there any aliens

47:46.240 --> 47:50.379
then I, I hope they're
vastly superior to humans.

47:50.380 --> 47:51.669
It shouldn't be that hard.

47:51.670 --> 47:53.139
- I don't know, we are like

47:53.140 --> 47:56.069
the most intelligent beings
in the known universe.

47:56.070 --> 47:57.759
That's a scary thought.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.049
- I guess, but think about all
that man has accomplished.

48:01.050 --> 48:06.050
I mean, goin' to space, building
the Great Wall of China,

48:06.190 --> 48:07.699
Pyramids in Egypt.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.429
Slave labor.

48:09.430 --> 48:10.779
It's great.

48:10.780 --> 48:12.669
- Yeah, but think about
how far we've come,

48:12.670 --> 48:14.079
and how far we'll go.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.479
The possibilities are endless.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.749
I really feel like
we're moving backwards

48:18.750 --> 48:20.059
rather than forwards.

48:20.060 --> 48:20.930
Really?

48:20.931 --> 48:24.139
Yeah, I mean, take
cellphones for instance.

48:24.140 --> 48:26.999
Everybody's glued to
these cellphones.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.879
I pick up a passenger,

48:28.880 --> 48:31.259
the ride's 20 minutes long,

48:31.260 --> 48:35.413
they're glued to their phone
the entire length of the ride.

48:36.670 --> 48:38.889
I remember a time
when people used

48:38.890 --> 48:42.099
to communicate with each other.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.733
When people used to
engage with one another.

48:45.890 --> 48:48.519
I remember a time
when your neighbors

48:48.520 --> 48:49.839
would leave their doors open,

48:49.840 --> 48:52.889
and you could come over
at anytime you wanted to.

48:52.890 --> 48:54.729
- Yeah, man, but look
at all the stuff

48:54.730 --> 48:57.179
you can do on cellphones
that we couldn't do before.

48:57.180 --> 49:00.059
Like order a pizza by
just tapping a few times.

49:00.060 --> 49:01.459
I mean, it's like magic.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.159
We've been able to
do that for decades.

49:04.160 --> 49:08.289
It's called picking up a
phone and placing an order.

49:08.290 --> 49:09.220
- Like, dude, I don't know.

49:09.221 --> 49:11.419
Did something like happen to
you when you were younger

49:11.420 --> 49:14.449
that just made you
give up and lose hope?

49:14.450 --> 49:16.829
I haven't lost all hope.

49:16.830 --> 49:18.859
Well, it doesn't sound like it.

49:18.860 --> 49:20.423
I'm just observing.

49:21.430 --> 49:24.749
I mean, take that
guy for an example.

49:24.750 --> 49:27.289
Oh, he's texting while driving.

49:27.290 --> 49:30.099
If that isn't a manslaughter
case waiting to happen,

49:30.100 --> 49:32.619
I, I don't know what is.

49:32.620 --> 49:33.849
People are so tuned out,

49:33.850 --> 49:36.053
they have no idea of
their surroundings.

49:36.980 --> 49:38.659
The majority of them are morons.

49:38.660 --> 49:40.639
- Hmm, see that's
why once in a while

49:40.640 --> 49:41.849
I get away from it all.

49:41.850 --> 49:43.259
Oh, really?

49:43.260 --> 49:44.329
- I unplug.

49:44.330 --> 49:47.009
I go out into the wilderness.

49:47.010 --> 49:49.393
A guy like you out
in the wilderness?

49:50.250 --> 49:51.339
- Yeah.

49:51.340 --> 49:52.409
I can't even picture

49:52.410 --> 49:55.046
a guy like me out
in the wilderness.

49:55.047 --> 49:57.679
See, what are you
complaining about?

49:57.680 --> 49:59.779
I'm not complaining.

49:59.780 --> 50:00.843
I'm observing.

50:02.130 --> 50:03.219
- Well, believe it or not,

50:03.220 --> 50:06.999
camping can lead to some
very valuable insights.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.559
More people should be like you.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.589
You're quite the model citizen.

50:11.590 --> 50:13.069
- You know, I think they are.

50:13.070 --> 50:14.419
They just kinda
put up this front

50:14.420 --> 50:16.329
for other people
to make them think

50:16.330 --> 50:19.459
they live a certain way
and they're so happy.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.116
Especially out here in LA.

50:21.117 --> 50:22.959
Now that's deep.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.569
- Look, when people see me,

50:24.570 --> 50:27.149
they get a whole
different idea about me.

50:27.150 --> 50:28.889
I can't imagine.

50:28.890 --> 50:32.107
- They see this gothic,
emo, pussy boy.

50:32.969 --> 50:35.579
Well, I, I mean, when
you walked to the door,

50:35.580 --> 50:37.599
you looked like Bela Lugosi

50:37.600 --> 50:40.069
on his way to a
Transylvania party.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.399
You don't really scream out,

50:41.400 --> 50:43.079
hey, come here and
give me a hug.

50:43.080 --> 50:44.383
Touche.

50:45.302 --> 50:47.549
But you know, when
people get to know me,

50:47.550 --> 50:50.469
they see that I'm
actually just like them.

50:50.470 --> 50:52.589
But you're not like them.

50:52.590 --> 50:54.109
I'm not?

50:54.110 --> 50:55.869
You don't look like them.

50:55.870 --> 50:57.133
You don't act like them.

50:58.150 --> 50:59.919
Most people are judgemental.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.709
- Well, yeah, I'm
judgemental too,

51:01.710 --> 51:03.929
but I don't know, you
know what I mean.

51:03.930 --> 51:05.009
Yeah, but...

51:05.010 --> 51:08.729
- Just, what I'm saying is
just because I look like this

51:08.730 --> 51:11.009
doesn't mean that I'm a bad guy.

51:11.010 --> 51:13.999
It just means you're
misunderstood.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.900
- I mean, I wouldn't
even go that far.

51:17.770 --> 51:19.919
Hey, I'm up here to the right.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.920
Oh.

51:25.340 --> 51:26.340
Well,

51:27.190 --> 51:29.399
thank you for taking the time

51:29.400 --> 51:31.509
to have a meaningful
conversation with me.

51:31.510 --> 51:32.999
- No problem, man.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.313
Ah, hey, if you ever need
anything, um, here's my card.

51:38.210 --> 51:39.210
Okay.

51:39.950 --> 51:41.633
- Well, off to work, hmm.

51:42.650 --> 51:44.169
You work here?

51:44.170 --> 51:45.003
- Yeah.

51:45.004 --> 51:46.623
Got the graveyard shift.

51:48.220 --> 51:49.669
Drive safe.

51:49.670 --> 51:50.670
I'll try.

52:05.020 --> 52:06.859
Are you Jason?

52:06.860 --> 52:08.389
I should be.

52:08.390 --> 52:09.390
- Thanks.

52:29.059 --> 52:32.023
Adorbs little hula
girl, isn't she?

52:33.340 --> 52:34.340
Thank you.

52:35.410 --> 52:37.836
- I was being sarcastic.

52:37.837 --> 52:38.920
Oh.

52:41.180 --> 52:44.339
- You just thought that
was adorable, didn't you?

52:44.340 --> 52:47.049
Like you didn't even
think about like,

52:47.050 --> 52:52.101
the raping and pillaging of
like the continent of Hawaii?

52:52.125 --> 52:53.582
Hmm.

52:53.583 --> 52:56.110
I didn't realize Hawaii
was a continent.

52:57.747 --> 52:58.960
No.

53:00.510 --> 53:01.830
No.

53:05.167 --> 53:06.999
At Goodwill.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.343
It was a good find.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.409
- So, you're not gonna
take it down because

53:14.410 --> 53:18.409
like it was a really
good find at Goodwill?

53:18.410 --> 53:20.859
I didn't think it
would offend anyone.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.669
- Well, you as a white,

53:23.670 --> 53:26.099
privileged male should know that

53:26.100 --> 53:29.199
that is very offensive
to some people.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.139
So now you're judging me?

53:31.140 --> 53:32.669
- I'm not judging you.

53:32.670 --> 53:34.709
I don't judge,

53:34.710 --> 53:36.669
but you're obviously ignorant

53:36.670 --> 53:38.369
because you didn't even know

53:38.370 --> 53:41.259
about the raping and
pillaging of Hawaii.

53:41.260 --> 53:43.369
What do you want me to say?

53:43.370 --> 53:45.479
- I don't want you
to say anything.

53:45.480 --> 53:47.109
I just want you to take down

53:47.110 --> 53:50.053
your little
sexualized hula girl.

53:51.180 --> 53:52.180
Not gonna happen.

53:52.181 --> 53:54.472
You can give me one
star if you want.

53:54.473 --> 53:58.539
- Huh, I will do more
than give you a one star.

53:58.540 --> 54:01.939
Cool, um, you can get off here.

54:01.940 --> 54:05.873
- No, I'd like you to take
me to my destination.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.019
Oh, sure.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.869
I'll totally do that.

54:10.870 --> 54:11.963
- Gee, thanks.

54:13.370 --> 54:16.329
I'm not quite sure
why my beautiful

54:16.330 --> 54:18.919
Hawaiian hula
princess offends you.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.749
- Yeah, worst thing in the world

54:20.750 --> 54:23.569
is if someone takes away
your little hula tramp.

54:23.570 --> 54:24.410
Pretty funny.

54:24.411 --> 54:27.989
The real comedy is how much
you're offended by it.

54:27.990 --> 54:29.399
- I'm getting
offended because this

54:29.400 --> 54:31.949
is something that
hurts and effects me.

54:31.950 --> 54:34.189
How does it effect you again?

54:34.190 --> 54:36.049
- It's offensive.

54:36.050 --> 54:37.636
How many times do I
have to tell you,

54:37.637 --> 54:39.483
you ignorant little twat?

54:40.670 --> 54:42.769
You look thirsty.

54:42.770 --> 54:44.112
Looks like you could use some

54:45.070 --> 54:46.375
water.

54:48.450 --> 54:52.373
- Oh, a thirsty girl like
you should stay hydrated.

54:53.580 --> 54:54.679
- Alright, look bitch.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.069
Maybe your other
little hula whores

54:57.070 --> 54:59.219
would fall into your
little thirst trap.

55:01.560 --> 55:04.020
- You think that all
women are just toys.

55:04.021 --> 55:04.854
I didn't say that.

55:04.855 --> 55:06.549
- That's what you're saying

55:06.550 --> 55:09.329
by failing to take
that stupid doll down.

55:09.330 --> 55:12.391
That we're all just toys
for boys to play with.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.719
Exactly.

55:13.720 --> 55:15.049
- Wow.

55:15.050 --> 55:19.199
I care way too much for you to
have such an obnoxious doll.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.889
That's sad, actually.

55:20.890 --> 55:23.325
- It's not sad, it's important.

55:23.326 --> 55:24.280
It's pathetic.

55:24.281 --> 55:26.159
- It's not pathetic.

55:26.160 --> 55:28.579
Can I have your name, please?

55:28.580 --> 55:30.999
The name is in the app.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.053
- No, smart ass, your full name.

55:33.930 --> 55:34.930
Jason.

55:37.640 --> 55:38.959
Palmer.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.199
- Thank you.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.267
You're the worst passenger
I've ever had on Hitch.

55:45.268 --> 55:47.409
- Huh, I feel special.

55:47.410 --> 55:48.243
It's pathetic that

55:48.244 --> 55:50.297
you're taking offense to a doll.

55:50.298 --> 55:51.327
- Women

55:51.328 --> 55:52.514
are not dolls.

55:52.515 --> 55:53.515
Women are not dolls.

55:54.682 --> 55:55.777
This

55:55.778 --> 55:56.611
is a doll.

55:56.612 --> 56:00.369
- That is a disrespectful object
that you have in your car,

56:00.370 --> 56:01.203
and you

56:01.203 --> 56:02.050
as a

56:02.051 --> 56:03.209
fat,

56:03.210 --> 56:04.043
white,

56:04.044 --> 56:05.609
privileged male

56:05.610 --> 56:07.319
should know better
that some people

56:07.320 --> 56:09.639
might find that offensive.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.889
You want me to pull
it off the dash?

56:11.890 --> 56:12.909
- No.
- It's Super Glued.

56:12.910 --> 56:14.470
- I'm just saying,
you could just maybe

56:14.494 --> 56:16.889
set it down for like a second.

56:16.890 --> 56:19.009
You should know that
not all passengers

56:19.010 --> 56:20.939
are going to find that amusing,

56:20.940 --> 56:22.179
and you're gonna experience

56:22.180 --> 56:24.213
this again, by the
way, and again.

56:25.050 --> 56:26.050
Okay.

56:30.460 --> 56:31.629
- So,

56:31.630 --> 56:32.849
I hope

56:32.850 --> 56:34.219
that like from this lesson.

56:34.220 --> 56:35.989
What was the lesson again?

56:35.990 --> 56:38.439
That you're a bitch?

56:38.440 --> 56:39.290
Oh,

56:39.290 --> 56:40.123
cool lesson.

56:40.124 --> 56:41.579
- I'm not a bitch.

56:41.580 --> 56:43.703
You're not pleasant now are you?

56:43.704 --> 56:47.229
- Ah-ho, so now I haven't
been pleasant enough

56:47.230 --> 56:50.009
to the little fat man
who's driving me.

56:50.010 --> 56:53.239
I've been nothing but
pleasant to you.

56:53.240 --> 56:56.529
- Bee-tee-dubs, I've been
recording this the entire time.

56:56.530 --> 56:57.998
I'm super excited.

56:57.999 --> 56:59.329
Oh,

56:59.330 --> 57:00.163
dope.

57:00.164 --> 57:03.309
- You're gonna be on
the World Wide Web.

57:03.310 --> 57:07.669
Cool, I always wanted to
be an internet sensation.

57:07.670 --> 57:09.099
- It'll be hilar.

57:09.100 --> 57:10.549
I'm ending this ride now.

57:10.550 --> 57:12.479
You can call another
Hitch if you want to.

57:12.480 --> 57:15.662
- No, you can take me all
the way to my house.

57:15.663 --> 57:17.589
I'm, I'm ending the ride now.

57:17.590 --> 57:19.359
Here's the sidewalk.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.643
Have a wonderful night.

57:21.880 --> 57:23.339
- Thank you.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.769
I'm super excited.

57:24.770 --> 57:26.929
Can I have your
name again, please?

57:26.930 --> 57:28.529
No.

57:28.530 --> 57:29.520
- I want your name.

57:29.521 --> 57:31.479
Give me your name again.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.793
Look, please exit my vehicle.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.259
- Fine, then I'll
just stay here.

57:38.260 --> 57:40.989
Please, get out of my vehicle.

57:40.990 --> 57:42.279
- No, I won't.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.349
Why don't you just
call the police?

57:44.350 --> 57:46.159
Why don't you just call 911

57:46.160 --> 57:48.383
about how I won't get
out of your car?

57:50.870 --> 57:52.699
This is my vehicle,

57:52.700 --> 57:55.403
and I am telling you to get out.

57:57.050 --> 57:58.419
- Fine.

57:58.420 --> 58:00.114
Here's what I'll
do instead then.

58:38.801 --> 58:41.420
- Don't come any
closer to me, freak.

58:41.421 --> 58:42.502
R, rape,

58:42.503 --> 58:43.920
rape, no, no, no.

59:02.716 --> 59:03.966
- Aloha, bitch.

01:00:00.438 --> 01:00:03.073
Oh, my God, I'm so lit.

01:00:03.074 --> 01:00:03.929
- Oh, my God.

01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:04.762
Oh, God,

01:00:04.762 --> 01:00:05.762
me too.

01:00:15.793 --> 01:00:17.710
Here we are.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.330
C'mon, baby, let me go
show you my yacht, mmm.

01:00:27.793 --> 01:00:28.793
Here you go, man.

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:31.882
You, you, you really
don't have to.

01:00:31.883 --> 01:00:33.029
- Huh,

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.863
it's good.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:34.863
Just take it.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.339
Look, just, can you
come back again?

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.339
What happened to the first girl?

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.509
- I dumped her.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:45.379
Oh, so she was your girlfriend?

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.240
- I don't mean to
be rude, alright,

01:00:46.241 --> 01:00:48.109
but I'm not paying you
to ask questions.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.163
Just come back in
about two hours.

01:00:52.137 --> 01:00:53.309
I don't know.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:54.510
Just once more.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.695
I'm not sure about this.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:00.479
- This time I'll really
make it worth your while.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.079
If you say so.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.793
- Alright, my man, two hours.

01:01:10.893 --> 01:01:11.893
- [Anchor Michael Buckley]
Who wore it best,

01:01:11.894 --> 01:01:13.349
Amy Toomer or Cassie the Lassie,

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:15.569
find out next on the fall
fashion fail of the week.

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:19.809
Ah, Los Angeles, city of dreams.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.459
The beaches,

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.869
the glam,

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.903
the celebrities,

01:01:25.024 --> 01:01:26.689
the traffic.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:29.339
Getting around this town
can sure be a hassle.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.579
We're here to help.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:33.539
Our experienced drivers and
our hybrid electric fleet

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.440
will... - Breaking news.

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.889
Social media celebrity,
Spankie Valentine

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.949
never showed up to
her concert tonight

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.749
and is apparently missing.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:44.139
The social media icon was last
seen on Snap in her Hitch,

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.709
in what appears to be
on the way to her show.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:49.309
These two photos are the
last we heard from her.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:52.139
The first one says my hitch
driver is making me late.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.329
The next one says
his name is Jason,

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:57.219
give him one star,
thumbs down emoji.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.299
This guy Jason looks like
a creep, if you ask me.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.027
If you see or have any
information on this driver.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.780
Ah, move over, dude.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.432
Oops, sorry.

01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:12.553
Just sit in the front, dude.

01:02:12.577 --> 01:02:14.069
Yeah, go in the
front, you big dick.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.929
Too late, sandwich party.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.030
Oh, not again.

01:02:18.554 --> 01:02:19.804
Oh, man.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.220
- Hey, you look like
that guy on the news.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.538
- Oh, that guy.

01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:34.849
Oh, that guy.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:36.673
I beg your pardon?

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.459
It's been all over the news.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.509
There's like this
Hitch Driver Killer

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.829
or Hitch Killer
Driver, whatever.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.179
They sent like a sigalert out.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.429
Didn't you get one?

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:49.789
Oh, is there now?

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:52.749
- Yeah, and it's funny, you
kinda match the description.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.279
Oh, well that's mumbo jumbo.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.169
- We're just messin'
with ya, man.

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:58.269
Hey, look it up.

01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:59.270
Look it up.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.669
- Dude, he's the killer.

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:04.349
He's totally the killer.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.599
Dude, I think he
actually is the killer.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.659
- I know, dude, that's
what I just told him.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.899
Okay, okay, what was
the killer's name?

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.289
Do you remember him,
do you remember?

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.970
- Ah, it was Jason.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.973
- The app said Justin.

01:03:28.824 --> 01:03:29.824
- No.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.449
- Well, check the app, dude.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.430
- Okay, jeez.
- Yeah, c'mon.

01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:36.529
- Give me a second.
- C'mon, hurry up.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.130
I'm on like one percent.

01:03:39.837 --> 01:03:42.132
- It's ah,

01:03:42.133 --> 01:03:43.219
it's dead.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.489
Oh, what'd we do?

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.289
- Nothing, we do nothing.

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:49.170
We act

01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:50.179
calm,

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.659
and we be

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.219
cool.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.827
- Calm and cool, yeah, I can do.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.109
Oh, I can't do this,
I'm way too hammered.

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.029
Too hammered for what exactly?

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:09.503
- Not, not, even to
hammer, what, nothing.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:15.413
- How sure are you his name
was Justin on the app?

01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:18.657
- Pretty sure.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.919
That's not gonna cut it.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.229
Why don't we ask him his name?

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:24.859
That's a novel idea.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.079
- Okay.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:26.913
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

01:04:26.914 --> 01:04:28.010
Let's do it. - Let's do it.

01:04:28.011 --> 01:04:29.283
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:31.105
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

01:04:31.106 --> 01:04:32.466
- That's what I
said, let's do it.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.240
- Okay, so ask him his name.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.649
- You, you ask him.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.793
- You ordered the Hitch, not me.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.840
- I think Ed should ask.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.279
Does it not say in your app?

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.702
- Yeah, but this guy's an
idiot and his phone died.

01:04:51.703 --> 01:04:52.690
- Huh, yeah, I'm an idiot.

01:04:52.691 --> 01:04:54.309
My phone died.

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.089
- Yeah, dumb ass.
- Just, you know, curious.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.579
It's okay.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.783
My name is Justin.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.429
- I can't tell if
you're messing with us.

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:04.263
Is he messing with us?

01:05:04.264 --> 01:05:05.339
- I can't tell.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.399
Why would I be messing with you?

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.919
- Because you're
a psycho killer,

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.379
dude. - Ed.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:14.609
- I mean, just kidding.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.059
Dude, he's definitely
the killer.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.700
- 100%.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.429
- Nothing.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:21.500
We do nothing.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.629
- He's one dude.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.259
We're three dudes.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.810
We could totally take him.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.835
Sure.

01:05:30.836 --> 01:05:32.479
- Yeah, just a little louder.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.238
Just, turn it up, turn it up.

01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:37.570
That's as loud as it goes.

01:05:38.597 --> 01:05:39.597
- He doesn't have a gun.

01:05:39.597 --> 01:05:40.570
- Yeah, but he might have a gun.

01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:41.942
- Because killers have guns.

01:05:41.943 --> 01:05:42.937
He doesn't have a gun.

01:05:42.937 --> 01:05:43.936
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Well, I think we should

01:05:43.937 --> 01:05:45.318
check, he might have one.
- Don't think, no, nobody's,

01:05:45.319 --> 01:05:46.759
- He might have one hid.
Got, nobody,

01:05:46.783 --> 01:05:48.809
nobody's got a gun.
- Boys, I don't have a gun.

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:50.519
My name is Justin.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.099
I'm not the killer.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.799
As you said for yourself,
the killer's name is Jason.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.499
You have nothing to worry about.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.890
- I thought you said you didn't

01:05:58.891 --> 01:06:00.771
know anything about it?
- Okay, yeah, it's cool.

01:06:00.795 --> 01:06:03.619
You know what, I'm sorry, man,
we're just a little tipsy.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.453
Our bad.

01:06:04.454 --> 01:06:05.579
No worries.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.729
We're only five minutes away.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.869
Here,

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:10.253
have some waters.

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:12.570
- Thanks.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.380
- Dude, du, du, du, du,
dude, don't drink that.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.962
Don't drink that.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.229
- No, dude, what if it's

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:20.396
rape water?

01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:23.029
- Uh, uh-hum, yeah,
yeah, yeah, rape water.

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:25.659
It's water people give you
so they can rape you.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.354
- Dude, I'm takin' my chances.

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:32.919
- Dude, if you end up in a
gutter with a sore butt hole,

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.439
that is one you.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.479
Ah, hey, listen man, ah,
it looks like actually,

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.329
this is great, you can
just drop us off here,

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just right
up the street, right here.

01:06:41.594 --> 01:06:43.986
- Strange, the app says
we're five minutes away.

01:06:43.987 --> 01:06:45.499
- No, you know, that's wrong.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.325
Maps are stupid,
this is the bar.

01:06:47.326 --> 01:06:49.465
- Uh-huh.
- This, this isn't the bar.

01:06:49.466 --> 01:06:50.919
Ow, what did you do that for?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.289
- You can just pull over here.

01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.123
Thank you.

01:06:53.123 --> 01:06:53.956
Are you sure?

01:06:53.957 --> 01:06:55.819
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is great.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.239
This is great.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.439
- Oh,

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.999
okay.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.369
Have a great night.

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.370
- Great, thanks, man.

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:03.203
- Thanks.

01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:04.036
- Thanks.
- Get out of the car,

01:07:04.037 --> 01:07:06.913
get out of the car.
- Alright, alright.

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:15.419
So, yeah, that was
definitely the killer.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.458
- No, shit, Sherlock.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060
- Yes.

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:24.209
- But he said his
name was Justin.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.569
The app said his
name was Justin.

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:28.619
I'm pretty sure...
- He said his name was Justin.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.499
So his name must be Justin?

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.929
I say my name is Josh,

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.109
and I'm a huge dip shit.

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:35.799
- Yeah, but you're not Josh.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800
I'm Josh.

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.950
- Do you really think
he's gonna roll up to us

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.759
and be like, hey guys,
my name's Jason,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.659
the serial killer Hitch driver?

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.630
I'm a murderer.

01:07:44.631 --> 01:07:45.963
Welcome to your nightmare.

01:07:47.305 --> 01:07:49.026
- Oh, that's a good point, yeah.

01:07:49.027 --> 01:07:50.869
So, let's just get to a bar,

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:53.059
find you a charger,
turn your phone on,

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.699
and then we can report
this son of a bitch.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.100
- Wait, give, give me a sec.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.380
- Uh,

01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:02.571
Jesus Christ.

01:08:02.572 --> 01:08:03.572
- Jesus.

01:08:11.903 --> 01:08:12.903
Yes.

01:08:12.904 --> 01:08:14.319
Crazy.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.800
- Yeah, man, I feel
sorry for whoever

01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:17.724
has to get in that
Hitch driver's car.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.559
Likewise.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.889
- I mean, I, I, I, honestly,

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.379
I wasn't even gonna
get one with all

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.769
the hubbub and shit goin' on.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.259
But you decided to anyway?

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.139
- Yeah, man, I mean,
I'm starving.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.500
I don't have anymore
food at home,

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:33.038
and I haven't eaten all day, so.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.499
So you decided to
go grocery shopping

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.099
at one in the morning?

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.729
- Hey, man, I mean,
when you gotta eat,

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:40.769
you gotta eat and, and plus,

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:43.229
I mean, if I was to ride
with that Hitch driver,

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:45.908
he wouldn't be able to fool me
like he does everybody else.

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:46.743
Oh, yeah?

01:08:46.743 --> 01:08:47.576
- Yeah, man, I mean, apparently

01:08:47.577 --> 01:08:49.799
he's giving people
drugged up waters.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.633
Really?

01:08:50.634 --> 01:08:52.959
- Mm-hmm, so rule number one,

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.817
don't drink the damn water
the Hitch driver gives you.

01:08:55.818 --> 01:08:58.313
That sounds like a
great strategy.

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:00.229
- It's simple.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.644
Would you like a.

01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:05.788
Gummi Bear?

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:08.433
- Mm, I love Gummi
Bears, thank you.

01:09:13.957 --> 01:09:17.519
But anyway, if I
were to get killed,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.760
I aint goin' out like no bitch.

01:09:18.783 --> 01:09:20.234
I'm goin' down like a badass.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.609
How does one go out
like a badass?

01:09:24.973 --> 01:09:26.023
- I don't know, like,

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:30.300
what if he sets me on fire
and throws me off a cliff?

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:33.729
And you don't feel
like that's overkill?

01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:46.089
- Uh-oh, we got some
heat on our tail.

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:47.140
I see that.

01:09:48.258 --> 01:09:49.944
- Hope he don't pull us over.

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:51.863
Now, why would they do that?

01:09:53.852 --> 01:09:55.403
- You never know nowadays, man.

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:02.549
It's not lookin'
good for you, man.

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.809
Look, will you shut up?

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:06.483
- Oh, oh, man, just,

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.412
just chill.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.050
- No problem, license and
registration, please?

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.963
- I'm not not cooperating, sir.

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:24.723
- No deal, he, um,

01:11:25.608 --> 01:11:28.720
he just had a, a long night.

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.709
- No, sir, I, I, in
fact, I'll probably

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:33.989
go a few more hours, actually.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:36.129
- Look, we can do
this the easy way

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:37.999
or the hard way, your choice.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.430
- Officer of the law,
is, is that a threat?

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:42.800
Okay, okay.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440
- Hold on a sec.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.060
- No.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.419
Answer me, you ever
been arrested?

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.029
- Yes, once.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.689
What for?

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:12.270
- Trespassing.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.673
- We were ghost hunting.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.903
- I was 17.

01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.210
- Now don't get smart
with me, buddy.

01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:30.239
- I'm not, I'm not.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.419
I'm 42, sir.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.969
- You don't look 42.

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:35.159
- Thank you.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.969
- That wasn't a compliment.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:39.373
- Look, sir, I really
need to get him home.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:42.319
On a hunch, it doesn't look

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.039
like he's in a rush.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.123
- Regardless, I'm on the clock.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.759
- Don't you get more money,
ah, for a longer ride?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.490
- I do, but if I take too
long it can effect my score.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.659
- 4.91.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.939
- Hmm.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.119
Why not five?

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.769
- Because five is unattainable.

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:01.969
Look sir, no offense,

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:04.339
but don't you have
anything better to do?

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.993
- As a matter of fact, I don't.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.479
Look, if you must know,

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.449
you fit the description of
somebody we've been looking for.

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:15.599
- What,

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.529
a fat guy in a car?

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.139
- It has nothing to
do with your weight.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.549
- No, I get it, I
understand now.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.129
You're looking for a fat guy,

01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:25.649
and you see me driving
around in this vehicle,

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:27.579
so automatically

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.340
you assume that...
- Look, if you gotta know,

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:31.589
your car fits the description
of what we're looking for.

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.679
- Oh, my car, so since
I'm the only fat person

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.979
who's driving a Prius
around Los Angeles

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.439
at one in the morning,

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.619
you're automatically gonna

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.679
pull me over, even though...
- I don't have to be

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.513
the nice guy, here.

01:13:41.514 --> 01:13:43.689
Do you call this being
the nice guy, sir?

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:45.179
- Yeah, I call this being nice.

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.480
- Look, are you gonna
give me a ticket or not?

01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:55.629
- Get outta here.

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:57.139
Have a nice night.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.140
- Thank you, sir.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.143
- I'd like to mention that, ah,

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.920
you shouldn't be
driving this thing

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.159
around here at this hour.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.959
A lot of weirdos.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.160
- Yes, sir, I won't sir.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.023
- And clean out that glove
compartment of yours.

01:14:17.733 --> 01:14:18.733
It's a mess.

01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:19.813
- Yes, sir.

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:34.399
You, you fell asleep.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.989
- Ah, man, I feel weird.

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.729
Well you said you hadn't
eaten in a while.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.796
- Yeah, man, but, I
mean, not only that,

01:14:41.797 --> 01:14:42.966
like, shh,

01:14:42.967 --> 01:14:44.216
mm.

01:14:44.217 --> 01:14:46.717
Uh-oh, we're almost
to your destination.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:50.593
Long enough.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.103
What cop?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.975
Oh, ah, he went the other way.

01:15:01.976 --> 01:15:02.976
- Okay, I see.

01:15:12.977 --> 01:15:14.186
And here we are.

01:15:14.187 --> 01:15:15.329
- Ah.
- Have a good night.

01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:16.197
- Ah, you too.

01:15:16.198 --> 01:15:20.439
Ah, hold on, ah, would you
mind just waiting on me?

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.779
Like 10 or 15 minutes?

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.939
Unfortunately, I don't
get paid to wait.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.899
- Well, look, I got
a $20 dollar bill

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.109
with your name on it,

01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:30.532
if you could just wait for me?

01:15:30.533 --> 01:15:31.567
Fine.

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:32.735
- You the man.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.442
Friday night.

01:15:53.443 --> 01:15:54.443
TGIF.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.639
I can't think of a
more pathetic excuse

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.729
of an existence than to live
every week for the Friday.

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:04.009
Hopeless men and
women, young and old,

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:05.879
are out looking to score.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.809
Or worse, find their
significant other.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:12.359
Getting drunk, stoned,

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.319
loaded, lit.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.419
Looking to take part
of a fiesta of flesh.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.409
Irreparable consequences
that could last a lifetime.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:24.609
Or at least 18 years.

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:26.709
Or at least $300
dollars of which

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.499
you have to borrow
from your aunt,

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.629
who made the same
mistake 20 years ago.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.859
This is the definition
of our generation.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.839
To go out and get shit faced,

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.339
and come back and do it
again week after week.

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.299
Doing whatever it takes to avoid

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.449
the mundane and arduous
stresses of everyday life.

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:57.819
We are not taught
to handle our shit.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.049
We are taught to blame,

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:02.169
and then beg, borrow,

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:03.379
steal

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.379
just to further our careers
for a bump in our salaries,

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.389
but I digress.

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:11.199
I'm no saint.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.969
I'm a slave to the wheel.

01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:15.671
Chauffeuring around these
grown adolescents.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.709
But this is what separates
myself from the rest.

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:32.529
I do this because I
choose to do this.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:35.869
Not because another has
told me where to work,

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:37.549
when to work,

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.679
and how much money to make.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.749
I am doing this out of the
sheer generosity of my being.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.269
I am giving them the opportunity

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.239
to end their suffering
much sooner,

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.269
than drawing out
their existences

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.519
as peons for decades.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.523
Spawning more drones.

01:17:56.703 --> 01:17:57.703
Hello, can I interest you

01:17:57.704 --> 01:18:00.403

Will a dollar work?

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:03.270

You're a good man.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620
you don't know me.

01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:36.521
But thanks.

01:20:42.882 --> 01:20:43.882
This eye,

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.523

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:37.949
- I'm just getting some
groceries and what not.

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.910
- Oh, yeah, I'm about to
head in there real quick,

01:21:39.911 --> 01:21:42.071
but, hey, you been hearing
what's been going on lately?

01:21:42.095 --> 01:21:44.779
- Bro, yes, craziness.
- Oh, that's just so crazy,

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.849
I'm only driving my own
damn car from now on.

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:49.579
- That's right sane.
- Duh, I don't have the time,

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.319
Okay? - Right, exactly.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.533
- I would never like.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.979
Wait.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.449
Really?

01:21:58.450 --> 01:21:59.940
- Damn, yeah, just a...

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.819
- Sorry, I mean, shit,
I was, I was hungry.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.039
- God, you know you could
have asked me for a ride.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.930
- I know, man, I mean,

01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.885
it's right up the street though.

01:22:09.885 --> 01:22:10.718
It's fine.
- Listen, Bro, literally,

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:12.289
I'll be ten minutes.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:13.376
I'll be in and out,

01:22:13.377 --> 01:22:14.639
and I can drive you home.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.629
- Bro, honestly, I don't even
think I can wait that long.

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:18.666
Ten minutes?

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.169
- Ah, I am starving.

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:21.489
Oh, my.

01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:22.859
It's fine man, he's chill.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.229
It's whatever.

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:26.030
- You're seriously about
to get in that Prius?

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:30.919
- You know the killer
drives a Prius.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.239
Okay, yeah, and literally

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.139
every other Hitch driver in
the greater Los Angeles area.

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.529
Is everything okay?

01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:38.850
Ah, yeah, it's,
everything's good.

01:22:38.874 --> 01:22:41.484
I'm sorry, I'll be right
there in a second.

01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:45.579
- He looks

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.716
like a killer.

01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:47.583
- Shh,

01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:48.416
uh.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:49.410
- Just give me five minutes.

01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:50.569
I'll be in and out.

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:51.403
- Just chill, bro.
- You don't to have to wait.

01:22:51.404 --> 01:22:53.204
- Like five minutes.
- Just, just, chill, man.

01:22:53.228 --> 01:22:55.679
Look, I appreciate you, look,
check it out, check it out.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.179
I'll hit you when I
get to the house.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.180
How 'bout that?

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.559
- Man, alright, I just
don't wanna wake up

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.749
and see you on the news.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.379
- You won't bro, I promise.
- You know, as dead.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.404
- Alright, man.
- Alright, man.

01:23:07.405 --> 01:23:08.885
- Appreciate you, man.
- Alright, man.

01:23:08.909 --> 01:23:10.409
- Take it easy, man.
- Later.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.289
Is everything okay?

01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:22.450
- Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

01:23:22.474 --> 01:23:25.404
It's just my friend being
worried as always.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.079
Did you get all the
groceries you needed?

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.749
- Oh, my gosh, yes.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:33.069
I cannot wait to get home
and cook this stuff.

01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:35.099
Well, if you're hungry now,

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.579
there's still some
Gummi Bears for you.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.909
Hell, yes.

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:39.910
Thank you.

01:23:43.898 --> 01:23:44.898
- Tremain,

01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:49.793
you really need to listen
to your friends more.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.983
Don't blame me.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.203
This was your idea.

01:25:01.671 --> 01:25:03.256
What the hell?

01:25:03.257 --> 01:25:05.253
Get back, get back here.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.818
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:08.986
Keep on going.

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:14.379
I think I got it.

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:16.020
- Oh, man, I just had
to get outta there.

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:18.199
Well, what, what the
hell just happened?

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.019
- Ran into one of
mix ex's, and, hah,

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.812
woo, she was not happy.

01:25:21.813 --> 01:25:23.719
- Hmm.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.129
- Look, thanks for giving
me a ride though, man.

01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:28.709
Sorry for putting
you through this.

01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:30.619
I sort of feel like
an accomplice.

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.449
- No, nah, nothing like that.

01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:35.169
So you saw an ex,

01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:38.099
and the bouncers chased
you out the door?

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.739
- Well, I mean,
she lied to them.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.240
Told them I was harassing her.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:44.599
Were you?

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.102
- No, of course not.

01:25:46.103 --> 01:25:48.343
I mean, she's just a
bitch, skank, whore.

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.873
Here we are.

01:25:52.874 --> 01:25:53.933
- Ah, thanks, man.

01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:57.019
So you gonna come
up for a drink?

01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.739
You know, I'd rather not.

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.037
- Alright, c'mon.

01:26:00.038 --> 01:26:01.579
I mean, you owe it to yourself.

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.383
Look, you work hard all day.

01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:05.602
I should be going home.

01:26:05.603 --> 01:26:08.099
- This is my last night in LA.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:08.980
True.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:09.980
However.

01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:13.119
Before I forget,

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120
here.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.489
This is an insane
amount of money.

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:27.322
- Look, I have more money
than I know what to do with.

01:26:27.323 --> 01:26:28.423
Just one drink.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.279
I do owe it to myself.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.489
- Yes, you do.

01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:34.490
You deserve it.

01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.599
You earned it.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Now didn't you?

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:39.911
C'mon?

01:26:39.912 --> 01:26:41.449
You know you want to.

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:42.866
You know you want to.

01:26:42.867 --> 01:26:44.949
- Oh, okay.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:45.783
Sure, why not?

01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:46.783
- Awesome.

01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:01.917
My brother, let's drink.

01:27:01.918 --> 01:27:03.568
C'mon, my yacht's
right this way.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:06.030
Special drink for you.

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.560
It's my family recipe.

01:27:11.068 --> 01:27:12.818
You're gonna like it.

01:27:14.715 --> 01:27:15.715
Promise.

01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:24.510
We're here.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.320
This definitely belongs
to his father.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.280
Welcome aboard.

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:54.113
- Wow.
- I know.

01:27:54.114 --> 01:27:55.407
Thank you.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.519
Oh, man, what is your drink
of choice, my friend?

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.490
What is your poison?

01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:02.959
- Oh,

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.329
liquor is

01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:05.970
liquor.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760
No.

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.220
Let me help.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.969
I need you to taste this,

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:15.579
and then tell me again

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.549
that liquor is

01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:18.550
liquor.

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.170
Swish that around for a minute.

01:28:31.227 --> 01:28:32.227
Ah.

01:28:33.402 --> 01:28:35.067
- That's exquisite.

01:28:35.068 --> 01:28:36.297
- That is is.

01:28:36.298 --> 01:28:37.759
That it is.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.549
I'm gonna make us a drink.

01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:41.109
Something special.

01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:44.093
It's my family recipe
called the Legend.

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.097
- Sounds, ah,

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.311
legendary.

01:28:48.312 --> 01:28:50.759
That it is my friend.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.421
That it is.

01:28:52.422 --> 01:28:54.722
I'll tell you what, you
go check out the view.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.129
- Yeah.

01:28:58.130 --> 01:28:59.796
- It's up there.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.660
Drinks are ready.

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.820
- Wow.

01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:26.989
This really is quite a boat.

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:28.467
- Ah, I know.

01:30:28.468 --> 01:30:29.869
I know.

01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:31.476
Oh.

01:30:31.477 --> 01:30:32.477
I'm sorry.

01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:36.279
Sorry, they just, they
leave 'em here, you know?

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.622
- Hmm.
- I'll tell you what,

01:30:37.623 --> 01:30:39.059
nah, you want it.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.289
Take it.

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:41.290
It's yours.

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.040
- Smells like a good year.

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220
- 2001.

01:30:49.487 --> 01:30:51.073
That's your drink, right there.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.713
Hmm, you know what,

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.113
I'm actually just
learning Spanish, so, uh,

01:31:00.003 --> 01:31:01.083
let me give it a go, I have

01:31:01.107 --> 01:31:02.886
I have this cheer
that I just learned.

01:31:03.815 --> 01:31:05.429
Aribba,

01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:06.769

01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:08.159
al centro,

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.379
al dentro.

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.280
And we drink.

01:31:10.281 --> 01:31:12.149
- Salud.
- Salud.

01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:13.486
Ah. - Gracias.

01:31:13.487 --> 01:31:14.487
Mm.

01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:17.819
- Mm.

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.979
Oh, this is incredible.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.890
- Legendary.

01:31:20.891 --> 01:31:22.559
- Legends.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.707
- Legendary it is, my friend.

01:31:32.991 --> 01:31:35.331
Just a splash,
that's all you need.

01:31:35.332 --> 01:31:36.165
- Alright.
- Chill it down

01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:37.313
just a bit.

01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:42.680
To.

01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:45.786
New friends.

01:31:45.787 --> 01:31:46.992
- To

01:31:46.993 --> 01:31:47.900
nuevos

01:31:47.901 --> 01:31:49.074
amigos.

01:31:49.075 --> 01:31:51.719
Alright.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.130
- Bottoms up.

01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:54.413
- Oy, bottoms up.

01:32:00.151 --> 01:32:01.696
Ah.

01:32:01.697 --> 01:32:03.497
- Ah.
- The perfection, every time.

01:32:04.856 --> 01:32:05.856
- Yes.

01:32:08.957 --> 01:32:12.832
Hmm.

01:32:21.136 --> 01:32:22.827
How are you feeling?

01:32:22.828 --> 01:32:23.828
Dizzy?

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.719
- Oh.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.803
- You little shit.

01:32:39.995 --> 01:32:41.795
You thought you were
better than me?

01:32:43.412 --> 01:32:44.600
You thought you knew

01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:47.652
how to take me out?

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.479
Don't you

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.548
try

01:32:55.711 --> 01:32:58.749
to be the boss?

01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.868
I'm the new captain
of this ship.

01:33:19.896 --> 01:33:20.896
Adios,

01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:22.910
amigo.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.759
Every night he's
with a new chick.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.410
Never seen him with
the same chick twice.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.380
- One of those
yachts over there.

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:40.099
He claims it's the largest one.

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.100
- Copy that.

01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:54.232
They're onto me.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.580
- Let's take a look at it.

01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:17.709
- Jesus Christ.

01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:21.909
I'll call it in.

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:24.059
- It was only a matter

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.060
of time.

01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:41.640
- This time I have a reason.

01:34:43.568 --> 01:34:45.586
Eh, just let me get
something real quick.

01:35:13.895 --> 01:35:16.562
- I didn't know you had tattoos.

01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:20.291
Oh.

01:35:21.276 --> 01:35:22.276
Oh, wait.

01:35:27.373 --> 01:35:28.373
No.

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:13.911
- Come out, with your hands up.

01:36:13.912 --> 01:36:16.245
Come out with your hands up.

01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:21.689
Get your hands up.

01:36:23.042 --> 01:36:25.669
- Hands up.

01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:26.959
Right there, hands up.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.970
- Higher.
- Don't take another step.

01:36:30.210 --> 01:36:31.515
Get on the ground.

01:36:31.516 --> 01:36:32.363
On the ground.

01:36:32.364 --> 01:36:35.199
- Down on the ground,
god damn it.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.347
Handcuff him.

01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:38.170
What's going on?

01:36:38.171 --> 01:36:39.623
Shut the fuck up.

01:36:41.190 --> 01:36:42.190
Get up.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.659
Off...

01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:54.703
Head down.

01:36:56.124 --> 01:36:57.124
Get in there.

01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:02.954
- The other off...
(door slamming shut.

01:37:16.570 --> 01:37:17.570
Yes.

01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:19.719
Which one, brothers or sisters?

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.720
Both.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.983
I have a brother who's a, a
little bit older than me.
