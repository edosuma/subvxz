02:18.225 --> 02:19.886
Get out of here!

02:48.155 --> 02:50.146
You're taking all our money again.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.737
You'll feel better when you get home.

03:16.016 --> 03:17.984
There's one over there.

03:24.491 --> 03:27.221
- Gonna be a long night, Mary.
- Too bloody long.

03:34.802 --> 03:37.965
It's quiet, isn't it? You having any luck?

03:38.071 --> 03:39.629
Not much, love.

03:47.147 --> 03:50.116
- Give you a penny for a suck.
- Piss off.

03:52.119 --> 03:54.587
- Hi. Where's Kate?
- Across the street.

04:01.695 --> 04:02.719
Miss?

04:03.831 --> 04:06.231
- What do you want?
- Shut your hole, bitch.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.662
I know you.
You're Geordie, from Nichol Street.

04:09.837 --> 04:12.635
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?

04:13.207 --> 04:15.107
I'd never forget you, McQueen.

04:17.744 --> 04:20.838
Will you stop that?
Buttons are hard to come by.

04:22.182 --> 04:24.776
What does a whore need buttons for?

04:24.918 --> 04:29.287
I warned you and your friends.
Payment was expected Monday.

04:29.623 --> 04:31.591
I'm working, ain't I?

04:31.725 --> 04:32.783
We all are.

04:33.894 --> 04:38.297
And I am making sure
that no one troubles you.

04:39.566 --> 04:42.364
I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly.

04:42.870 --> 04:44.770
And I expect to be paid...

04:45.072 --> 04:48.166
...or else you will be very troubled.

04:48.442 --> 04:50.342
Now, you tell...

04:51.178 --> 04:52.736
...your five...

04:53.146 --> 04:56.707
...friends they bring me my money
by tomorrow...

04:57.484 --> 04:59.315
...or this friend of mine here...

04:59.486 --> 05:01.750
...will be your next customer.

05:38.125 --> 05:41.253
- You're bloody filthy this morning.
- I bleedin' stink.

05:41.328 --> 05:45.094
- What'd you get up to last night?
- You don't want to know.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.158
Give us a look.

05:55.909 --> 05:57.399
Mary.

05:58.478 --> 06:00.241
Thank God I found you.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.845
He's coming.

06:02.082 --> 06:04.073
Albert's coming today.

06:04.184 --> 06:06.482
I need you to look after the baby.

06:06.687 --> 06:08.154
Let's have a hold.

06:09.222 --> 06:13.124
- I'm so proud of her.
- She's the most gorgeous little girl.

06:13.727 --> 06:15.490
Isn't she beautiful?

06:17.030 --> 06:18.930
She's lovely, isn't she?

06:19.166 --> 06:20.861
I'll be seeing you in a bit.

06:21.168 --> 06:22.999
Get us a jar of gin, will you?

06:23.637 --> 06:25.264
You look fine, Ann.

06:25.672 --> 06:28.573
Must be nice,
having a rich man looking after you.

06:29.009 --> 06:32.877
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?

06:34.414 --> 06:38.578
She is a perfect love, but, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.

06:38.752 --> 06:41.050
- The Nichols gang...
- They want our blood.

06:41.221 --> 06:43.746
- Know what they said they'd do?
- Don't start.

06:43.857 --> 06:45.688
What's she saying?

06:45.859 --> 06:48.054
They want £1 a week from each of us.

06:48.161 --> 06:50.095
Count yourself lucky.

06:50.230 --> 06:53.563
Good and lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of you.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.727
We need £4 to pay them,
so we can't spare the time.

06:58.205 --> 07:00.571
I'll get you the £4 from Albert.

07:00.674 --> 07:02.767
He might say no. I can't take a chance.

07:02.843 --> 07:05.243
He won't. I know he won't.

07:05.612 --> 07:08.206
He's been in France on business.

07:08.382 --> 07:10.907
He wrote, he sold a lot of his paintings.

07:10.984 --> 07:13.544
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.

07:13.754 --> 07:16.450
- To you perhaps, but...
- I'll ask for meself.

07:16.590 --> 07:19.115
I'll get you the £4. I promise.

07:29.870 --> 07:32.134
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

07:32.806 --> 07:34.137
Remember me?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.509
Remember who I am?

07:38.045 --> 07:42.812
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected. Much sooner.

07:44.151 --> 07:46.779
Be a good man. Get him home quickly.

07:46.953 --> 07:48.648
Quickly and quietly.

07:49.022 --> 07:50.455
Understood?

07:53.126 --> 07:54.616
Well said.

07:55.128 --> 07:57.392
Very well said.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.302
Take them out.

08:38.405 --> 08:40.236
What is the meaning of this?

08:40.307 --> 08:42.798
Kidney, what in God's name are you doing?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.605
I want this room in pieces.

08:56.690 --> 08:58.419
I demand an explanation.

08:58.525 --> 08:59.890
It's Albert.

09:08.802 --> 09:10.064
Get off me.

09:12.572 --> 09:13.903
Please. No!

09:20.514 --> 09:22.175
Who knows?

09:24.718 --> 09:26.242
I didn't know.

09:26.787 --> 09:28.550
I swear, I didn't.

09:28.855 --> 09:31.050
How can I tell anyone else?

09:33.727 --> 09:35.422
Who knows?

09:39.166 --> 09:40.895
Who knows?

09:46.039 --> 09:48.701
I don't know who they could be.

09:49.176 --> 09:51.940
Albert must've mixed in
with something terrible.

09:52.345 --> 09:55.246
She's hungry and cold, poor thing.

09:57.150 --> 09:59.015
I've got to take her to them.

09:59.152 --> 10:01.416
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.

10:01.488 --> 10:04.218
You go. Leave baby Alice with them.

10:04.291 --> 10:07.260
I'll get to work,
and I'll meet you later at the Ten Bells.

12:06.413 --> 12:08.278
Notice something, Inspector?

12:23.997 --> 12:26.659
I pay. I already pay.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.563
I'm not after you, Emperor. Where is he?

12:32.205 --> 12:33.502
Move it!

12:43.383 --> 12:44.611
Get up.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.343
Get up!

12:52.359 --> 12:53.621
Hello, darling.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.236
Sergeant.

13:13.013 --> 13:14.537
It's night.

13:14.681 --> 13:18.139
Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.
Indeed it is night.

13:18.218 --> 13:20.209
Our genius has returned to us.

13:20.687 --> 13:22.154
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:22.288 --> 13:26.224
Remember, if you ever wish to escape
the dreary confines of your duties...

13:26.459 --> 13:28.120
...this never happened.

13:28.294 --> 13:29.693
Cut along now.

13:32.932 --> 13:34.593
Have I lost a day?

13:34.801 --> 13:37.463
No. It's only four hours since you left here.

13:39.205 --> 13:41.765
Deepest apologies for the rude awakening.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.635
I suspect you enjoyed that.

13:44.778 --> 13:47.679
"I must be cruel only to be kind,"
as the poet said.

13:47.847 --> 13:51.339
Although, I'd happily wallop you
every time you chase the dragon.

13:51.684 --> 13:54.380
I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.

13:54.788 --> 13:56.415
You've seen something?

13:57.190 --> 13:58.680
What did you see?

14:01.428 --> 14:03.919
A petticoat saturated with blood.

14:05.765 --> 14:08.256
They used to burn men like you alive.

14:09.502 --> 14:13.029
Sometime this evening,
a bangtail was murdered in George Yard.

14:13.273 --> 14:15.707
That doesn't sound
much out of the ordinary.

14:16.142 --> 14:17.973
It was the way she was done.

14:18.778 --> 14:23.078
It was the way the bangtail was done
that cries out for a man of your talents.

14:33.526 --> 14:35.551
Her name was Martha Tabram.

14:35.762 --> 14:38.390
I don't know what sort of name Tabram is.

14:38.898 --> 14:40.832
It sounds foreign to me.

14:42.035 --> 14:43.832
This is not what I saw.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.463
Not the woman of your dreams?

14:46.773 --> 14:48.001
Are you sure?

14:50.643 --> 14:52.372
- Show him.
- You show him.

14:53.346 --> 14:57.476
Why do I have to be exposed
to this degradation over and over again?

14:57.951 --> 15:00.249
I've looked at the mess twice.

15:06.059 --> 15:10.155
Before he cut her throat,
he removed her livelihood as a keepsake.

15:20.707 --> 15:24.006
Gentlemen,
we are indeed fortunate today...

15:24.511 --> 15:29.710
...to be able to observe an entirely new
approach to the treatment of insanity.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.452
Dr. Ferral, I was just saying
to my colleagues...

15:33.653 --> 15:37.987
...we're here in the hope you'll permit us
to observe this new treatment of yours.

15:38.191 --> 15:41.922
I wasn't expecting
such distinguished visitors.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.825
But you're all welcome, of course.

15:43.997 --> 15:45.624
I'm ready to begin.

15:45.932 --> 15:48.162
- Who is your patient?
- Ann Crook.

15:48.601 --> 15:53.061
An unfortunate, Sir William,
who is hysterical and violent.

15:53.239 --> 15:55.764
And has severe delusions of persecution.

15:56.109 --> 15:58.737
Poor girl. Do please proceed.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.306
Gentlemen.

16:51.364 --> 16:53.332
We have one tap above...

16:57.370 --> 16:59.463
...and one into the left lobe.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.433
And...

17:05.444 --> 17:07.071
...one on the right...

17:07.680 --> 17:11.047
...and this unlucky patient's dementia...

17:11.384 --> 17:13.545
...will no longer take a violent form.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.150
Thanks to this simple procedure...

17:17.390 --> 17:21.156
...we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.

17:26.898 --> 17:30.198
What could I do? I had to leave
the baby with Ann's parents.

17:30.336 --> 17:32.930
Rich man?
Thought he was gonna take care of her?

17:33.006 --> 17:34.940
Knew that was too good to be true.

17:35.008 --> 17:37.340
They're gonna kill every one of us.

17:37.610 --> 17:40.101
Who is this Albert anyway?

17:40.179 --> 17:43.740
Who cares about Albert
and Ann's troubles?

17:43.816 --> 17:45.443
What are we gonna do?

17:45.585 --> 17:48.452
We can't stay clear
of the Nichols boys forever.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.955
They say that they held
poor Martha down...

17:51.057 --> 17:53.617
...and watched her bleed
until she passed out.

17:53.726 --> 17:55.819
Then they cut her throat.

17:55.962 --> 17:59.398
McQueen is mad.
He enjoys hurting women.

17:59.599 --> 18:03.592
It's insane that they want £4.
How are we gonna get £4?

18:03.670 --> 18:06.798
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.

18:08.374 --> 18:11.172
Behave yourselves or bugger off.

18:11.411 --> 18:12.969
You can bugger off.

18:13.413 --> 18:15.438
We work, girls.

18:15.615 --> 18:19.415
We work the streets harder than ever.
Right?

18:19.819 --> 18:20.877
Right?

18:23.423 --> 18:25.948
All right. We can do it here, but hurry up.

18:26.059 --> 18:28.755
- The bobbies are tracking us tonight.
- Right.

18:28.861 --> 18:31.091
Gotta get the old man hard first.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.030
Give it here. I'll put it in meself.

18:37.537 --> 18:40.165
- Is that in?
- Of course it is. Come on.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.675
It's not.
You got it stuck between your legs.

18:43.743 --> 18:46.075
No, I haven't. Come on.

18:46.179 --> 18:48.170
I knows it when I feels it.

18:59.892 --> 19:01.689
That's mine, Polly.

19:02.195 --> 19:03.753
That's my money.

19:08.334 --> 19:10.768
I could pop your eye out.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.034
The customers wouldn't mind.

19:13.172 --> 19:16.164
They don't mind if a whore can see.

19:18.344 --> 19:20.812
- What's that you got there?
- What've I got here?

19:21.581 --> 19:24.482
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.

19:24.784 --> 19:27.810
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.

19:28.354 --> 19:31.687
Move! Or I'll bash that smart mouth.

19:33.693 --> 19:35.627
You're a dead woman.

19:43.102 --> 19:46.230
Lovey, he won't bother you again tonight.

19:46.639 --> 19:48.197
That's right. Look.

19:48.307 --> 19:51.902
One for the Nichols, and one for me.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.279
Come here.

19:57.350 --> 19:59.614
We'll work the streets together.

19:59.752 --> 20:02.220
I'll keep my eye on you, love.

20:07.493 --> 20:09.051
You pig!

20:09.429 --> 20:11.420
You disgusting pig!

20:14.400 --> 20:16.368
Yeah, I'm a pig.

20:16.536 --> 20:18.731
I'm what's wrong with the world.

20:19.505 --> 20:21.132
Be on your own then.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.103
No!

20:23.876 --> 20:26.344
You don't want the company of a pig!

20:27.847 --> 20:30.077
What the fuck are you looking at?

20:47.266 --> 20:48.733
Thirsty?

20:54.340 --> 20:57.036
That was the thing that was in my dream.

20:57.677 --> 21:01.238
- What's it called again?
- Cleopatra's needle.

21:01.681 --> 21:04.775
Cleopatra. She was a beauty, wasn't she?

21:05.318 --> 21:10.551
It was carved 1,500 years
before the Son of God was born.

21:12.124 --> 21:15.753
Six men died to bring it here...

21:16.195 --> 21:18.254
...from Egypt.

22:21.661 --> 22:23.856
May the good Lord have mercy.

22:36.809 --> 22:40.074
She was like that when I found her.
All murdered.

22:40.313 --> 22:42.679
What kind of monster did this?

22:53.292 --> 22:55.783
The boys have made their rounds
of the taverns...

22:55.861 --> 22:59.388
...and the delightful domiciles
that make up this charming street.

22:59.565 --> 23:02.056
Will it surprise you
that no one heard a sound?

23:02.435 --> 23:05.495
Her throat was cut,
but there's no arterial spray on the wall.

23:05.738 --> 23:08.036
She was killed somewhere else.

23:12.445 --> 23:14.709
It rained last night, didn't it?

23:17.350 --> 23:19.011
She's dry.

23:20.453 --> 23:23.183
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.

23:23.356 --> 23:25.722
Her throat must've been cut
in the carriage.

23:25.825 --> 23:27.918
I imagine they stopped it over there.

23:28.194 --> 23:29.320
They?

23:30.596 --> 23:32.029
There's more than one?

23:32.498 --> 23:33.988
Most definitely.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.465
This was all in your vision?

23:43.776 --> 23:44.800
Jesus!

23:46.512 --> 23:49.640
So, definitely more than one person.

23:49.782 --> 23:52.478
It has to be a message
from the Nichols boys. Right?

23:55.187 --> 23:56.848
What the hell?

23:57.156 --> 23:58.817
That's grapes, isn't it?

23:59.225 --> 24:02.251
What the hell would a bangtail
be doing with grapes?

24:46.906 --> 24:49.272
I'd like to give them an answer.

24:49.608 --> 24:51.872
- What?
- The Nichols boys.

24:52.111 --> 24:56.548
I'd welcome the opportunity to give them
an answer to their bloody message.

24:57.316 --> 25:00.752
There is most definitely a message here.
You're right about that.

25:00.953 --> 25:02.784
What am I wrong about?

25:04.256 --> 25:08.454
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.323
That's cruel.

25:10.563 --> 25:13.726
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.

25:15.301 --> 25:17.292
This is methodical.

25:17.970 --> 25:20.370
The butchery is irrational, yet...

25:20.906 --> 25:23.238
...meticulous and deliberate.

25:25.778 --> 25:28.508
Altogether a different breed of killer.

25:30.416 --> 25:33.317
As soon as possible,
I'd like to know what he took.

25:33.419 --> 25:36.149
What do you mean "what he took"?

25:36.822 --> 25:38.881
- Didn't you notice?
- What?

25:39.692 --> 25:42.183
He's taken at least one of her organs.

25:42.328 --> 25:43.852
Oh, no.

25:51.937 --> 25:53.996
I want every veterinarian...

25:54.273 --> 25:57.674
...butcher, furrier in the district
interviewed.

25:58.344 --> 26:01.279
Furrier? What did he do, sir? Skin her?

26:01.514 --> 26:03.573
Pipe down, Withers.

26:04.016 --> 26:07.713
When the Inspector is talking
you are listening, understand?

26:08.187 --> 26:09.654
Yes, Sergeant.

26:10.256 --> 26:12.156
He disemboweled her.

26:13.058 --> 26:16.221
After he cut her throat,
stabbed her in the chest...

26:16.328 --> 26:20.526
...cut open her stomach,
and took out her intestines.

26:24.336 --> 26:26.998
At least one of her organs was removed.

26:27.540 --> 26:31.567
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's report
for more details.

26:33.813 --> 26:35.178
I see.

26:36.682 --> 26:40.413
One thing's for certain,
an Englishman didn't do it.

26:43.622 --> 26:47.285
Maybe one of these Red Indians...

26:47.693 --> 26:52.460
...wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.

26:54.233 --> 26:56.394
With all due respect, sir...

26:56.535 --> 27:00.938
...I believe this was done by someone with
at least a working knowledge of dissection.

27:01.006 --> 27:04.908
- An educated man, such as a doctor...
- An educated man? That's preposterous.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.137
No well-bred man would do this.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.778
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

27:11.784 --> 27:14.651
A tradesman is a possibility, sir.

27:15.421 --> 27:18.549
But there's a strong indication against it.

27:18.791 --> 27:21.282
There was a sprig of grapes
under her body.

27:21.393 --> 27:23.293
What are you driving at?

27:23.429 --> 27:28.389
No one in Whitechapel, no matter
what their trade, could afford grapes.

27:28.567 --> 27:31.001
Obviously,
they were given to her by the killer.

27:31.403 --> 27:34.338
It follows that he must be
someone with money.

27:34.773 --> 27:38.004
What about the Jews? A Jew butcher?

27:38.377 --> 27:42.677
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
Plenty of them in Whitechapel.

27:43.015 --> 27:46.041
Sir, for the sake of public safety
in general...

27:46.452 --> 27:50.183
...l'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumor it might be a Jew.

27:52.491 --> 27:56.484
I know your reputation for making guesses
that turn out to be right.

27:56.962 --> 28:00.125
Someone told me
you claim to dream the answers.

28:00.299 --> 28:03.564
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.

28:03.936 --> 28:08.270
But be certain you don't proceed
without proof. Is that clear?

28:08.407 --> 28:09.806
Of course, sir.

28:09.975 --> 28:14.207
Personally, I don't care. The fewer
pinch-pricks on the streets, the better.

28:14.813 --> 28:18.544
But the sooner you find this butcher
or tailor...

28:18.684 --> 28:22.211
...the sooner we can all celebrate
your promotion.

28:23.222 --> 28:25.053
Keep me informed.

28:51.917 --> 28:55.683
Every cellar, every stable. We'll find him.

28:55.754 --> 28:58.450
It's the bleeding Jews. Let's kill them!

31:00.546 --> 31:02.411
I have wonderful news.

31:02.714 --> 31:04.113
Tell me.

31:04.550 --> 31:07.075
Surely you, of all people, can guess.

31:07.586 --> 31:09.747
I don't want to guess with you.

31:11.924 --> 31:14.017
Dr. Marbury says...

31:16.528 --> 31:18.325
Dr. Marbury says?

31:19.998 --> 31:23.661
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.

31:55.501 --> 31:57.196
"Ay, to die

31:57.703 --> 31:59.603
"and go we know not where

31:59.771 --> 32:02.467
"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot"

32:05.644 --> 32:08.306
A simple "rest in peace" would suffice.

32:08.413 --> 32:09.641
Yes, sir.

32:10.582 --> 32:12.948
"In the midst of life we are in death...

32:13.118 --> 32:16.110
"...of whom may we seek for succor,
but of Thee, O Lord...

32:16.822 --> 32:19.450
"...who for our sins art justly displeased?

32:20.192 --> 32:22.717
"Yet, O Lord God most holy...

32:22.794 --> 32:24.421
"...O Lord most mighty..."

32:38.877 --> 32:40.868
Good afternoon, ladies.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.974
I'm Inspector Abberline.
This is Sgt. Godley.

32:44.049 --> 32:47.382
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.

32:47.486 --> 32:50.853
We understand they were both friends
of you ladies.

32:51.190 --> 32:54.682
Close friends.
We're hoping you'd be able to help us.

32:54.793 --> 32:56.761
Don't know nothing.

32:56.995 --> 32:58.326
Me neither.

32:58.430 --> 33:01.365
Why are you bothering us?
You ought to bother McQueen.

33:01.533 --> 33:05.094
- Is he the boss of Nichol Street?
- The heart and soul of the gang.

33:05.204 --> 33:08.605
Isn't it your job to be knowing
that small detail?

33:10.576 --> 33:13.067
What makes you think McQueen did this?

33:13.345 --> 33:15.210
Can't prove nothing by me.

33:17.316 --> 33:20.217
- You're Mary Kelly, right?
- That's right.

33:21.220 --> 33:24.246
Unless one of you is willing to testify
against McQueen...

33:24.323 --> 33:26.188
...I can't do nothing.

33:26.725 --> 33:28.625
Surely, Inspector...

33:28.760 --> 33:31.092
...a strong, handsome man like you...

33:31.263 --> 33:34.528
...could do anything
you put your brilliant mind to.

33:35.734 --> 33:38.601
I'm a coward and a weakling.
I can't help meself.

33:38.737 --> 33:42.400
What's your excuse?
Why are you so bloody useless?

33:46.044 --> 33:48.478
Come on, Mary. They won't help us.

34:13.071 --> 34:14.333
Is that you?

34:16.275 --> 34:19.141
Before my mother died, back in Ireland.

34:19.878 --> 34:22.540
- Is that when you came here?
- Yeah.

34:22.714 --> 34:25.842
- When I was 8.
- When things was good.

34:26.351 --> 34:30.047
We were starving,
but we were starving in fresh air.

34:32.391 --> 34:34.188
I was thinking...

34:34.860 --> 34:38.226
...we ain't never gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys...

34:38.397 --> 34:40.558
...and feed our own mouths.

34:42.234 --> 34:45.397
You said those men...

34:45.570 --> 34:48.539
...who took the rich artist man
and her as well...

34:48.706 --> 34:52.666
You said they was clean-shaven,
and their clothes was neat.

34:53.378 --> 34:55.676
- Right.
- They weren't criminals, then.

34:56.315 --> 34:58.806
They weren't the Nichols boys.

34:59.051 --> 35:00.678
They was unusual.

35:01.019 --> 35:02.543
Perhaps even official.

35:02.888 --> 35:04.583
What are you getting at?

35:06.224 --> 35:10.820
Maybe we could go with the papers,
get paid for the story.

35:11.229 --> 35:12.526
"Where's Ann Crook?"

35:12.597 --> 35:16.226
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.

35:16.335 --> 35:17.893
It's a mystery, to boot.

35:18.003 --> 35:20.233
Not a bad plan. What do you think, Mary?

35:20.372 --> 35:23.830
We should talk to that inspector,
the one at Polly's funeral.

35:24.009 --> 35:25.636
Fuck me! No.

35:25.844 --> 35:29.541
If we go to the papers, they might hurt Ann
even worse. Or hurt the baby.

35:29.715 --> 35:33.742
Worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?

35:33.852 --> 35:35.513
I don't know for sure.

35:35.687 --> 35:38.656
But I think we're better off
talking to that inspector.

35:38.757 --> 35:41.385
Lord, you are young after all.

35:44.329 --> 35:45.921
Four bitches.

35:46.264 --> 35:47.731
That's what I thought.

35:47.933 --> 35:49.958
You only paid for one person.

35:50.068 --> 35:51.797
- They're my guests.
- Guests?

35:52.037 --> 35:54.403
Let me welcome your guests.

35:55.874 --> 35:59.275
Go on! Get out!

35:59.511 --> 36:02.002
Get out of here, you bloody whores.

36:02.848 --> 36:04.816
When you have four pence...

36:04.983 --> 36:09.420
...you can come back
with your ladies in waiting, Your Grace.

36:09.921 --> 36:11.411
Shut up.

36:13.425 --> 36:14.892
Back to work then.

36:14.993 --> 36:16.927
Let's try and stay together.

36:17.062 --> 36:20.896
- We can't. You know that.
- Then stay good and clear of Nichol Street.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.958
Come on.

36:24.369 --> 36:26.064
All right, Annie?

36:27.038 --> 36:28.437
Bloody bastard.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.974
- How's your head?
- Very funny.

38:30.428 --> 38:31.452
Boo!

38:35.467 --> 38:37.367
I didn't frighten you, did I?

38:38.670 --> 38:40.103
I've been looking for you.

38:40.171 --> 38:42.071
Been looking all over for you.

38:42.274 --> 38:44.174
You've been looking for me?

38:44.709 --> 38:47.542
Not for me. On behalf of my gentleman.

38:47.812 --> 38:50.713
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find you.

38:50.916 --> 38:53.612
Your gentleman sent you to find me?

38:53.818 --> 38:57.720
Get off! I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blithering idiot.

38:57.822 --> 39:00.222
It's the truth! The God's truth.

39:01.059 --> 39:03.289
He's seen you. He likes you.

39:03.929 --> 39:06.591
He said, tonight, only you'll do.

39:07.866 --> 39:12.894
He said to find you, take you to
Hanover Street where he's waiting for you.

39:13.104 --> 39:14.867
You're very pretty.

39:18.910 --> 39:21.242
Go on. Get in, I'll take you there.

39:22.714 --> 39:25.979
I almost forgot.
My gentleman got you a present.

39:26.418 --> 39:28.886
- You like grapes?
- Yeah.

39:35.327 --> 39:38.854
Your gentleman, he must be very refined.

39:39.164 --> 39:41.428
- Very refined indeed.
- Get in.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.964
- I'll take you there.
- All right.

39:54.879 --> 39:56.369
Here we are.

40:05.056 --> 40:07.684
- I'm a lucky lady.
- You are, lady.

40:08.293 --> 40:11.490
Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?

40:11.830 --> 40:13.889
Just the usual, I expect.

40:15.567 --> 40:17.728
This alley takes you to the yard.

40:17.869 --> 40:21.896
My gentleman is quiet.
He doesn't like disturbances.

40:22.707 --> 40:26.643
What I want to know is, a toff like him...

40:26.811 --> 40:28.938
...how much is he offering?

40:30.315 --> 40:32.306
Here, £2 for now.

40:32.651 --> 40:34.482
That'll do me.

40:34.653 --> 40:36.245
Let me see you.

40:37.622 --> 40:41.285
- Down there?
- Straight down to the door at the end.

40:46.331 --> 40:48.231
Straight down there, right?

41:19.431 --> 41:21.331
You watch your mouth!

41:22.934 --> 41:26.062
Any more information?
My readers want to know.

41:26.438 --> 41:29.805
Is it true you found a piece
of leather apron in her mouth?

41:30.041 --> 41:35.104
No. But if it's your fancy, I'd be delighted
to stuff your mouth with leather.

41:36.114 --> 41:39.709
Give us a tidbit, Sergeant.
We'll put your picture on the front page.

41:41.586 --> 41:44.214
Do something about this.
This is ridiculous.

41:45.423 --> 41:48.984
There's a bloody murderer on the loose.
What about my wife?

42:20.892 --> 42:22.359
This is Annie.

42:23.294 --> 42:26.024
Yes. Another of the circle of friends.

42:26.231 --> 42:27.858
Annie Chapman.

42:28.032 --> 42:32.526
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn't the Nichols boys?

42:34.806 --> 42:38.435
Did the constable show you the bit
of leather found by the waterspout?

42:38.510 --> 42:40.944
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

42:41.513 --> 42:46.143
Leather apron. Dear God,
we could be looking for a butcher after all.

42:46.951 --> 42:48.248
I saw her.

42:49.821 --> 42:51.584
- This one?
- Yeah, last night.

42:53.725 --> 42:55.317
I saw her face.

43:00.498 --> 43:04.798
- Don't trample over this area.
- Let us see the body!

43:04.936 --> 43:07.268
- Come on, let us see.
- Oh, God.

43:07.338 --> 43:09.101
There's your typical Londoner...

43:09.174 --> 43:12.769
...imbued with the Christian spirit
of sympathy for his fellow man.

43:12.877 --> 43:15.072
Or fellow whore, in this case.

43:15.180 --> 43:17.307
He's really outdone himself this time.

43:17.415 --> 43:19.349
He not only severed the intestines...

43:19.450 --> 43:23.147
...he's carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.

43:23.321 --> 43:25.482
I think he's taken more organs this time.

43:31.563 --> 43:34.259
Grapes again. Why grapes?

43:35.466 --> 43:38.435
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.

43:38.870 --> 43:41.862
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.

43:42.574 --> 43:44.735
This ain't killing for profit.

43:46.244 --> 43:47.973
This is ritual.

43:48.146 --> 43:49.841
Yeah, but why grapes?

43:59.324 --> 44:01.986
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

44:12.170 --> 44:14.434
I've never fully understood that tradition.

44:14.772 --> 44:16.239
They're for the ferryman.

44:17.008 --> 44:20.967
The ferryman who takes the body
across the river into the land of the dead.

44:21.045 --> 44:23.479
If she don't have the money to pay him...

44:23.681 --> 44:27.674
...she'd have to wander,
forever lost between the two worlds.

44:35.393 --> 44:37.486
I need to consult a doctor.

44:37.629 --> 44:39.358
Are you ill, Inspector?

44:39.864 --> 44:41.695
A surgeon, to be specific.

44:42.166 --> 44:45.431
The killer removed
the victim's uterus and its attachments.

44:45.737 --> 44:48.433
My God. He's out of his mind.

44:48.973 --> 44:51.134
That's very astute of you, sir.

44:51.276 --> 44:54.268
I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.

44:54.445 --> 44:56.572
I'm sorry, sir. I meant nothing by it.

44:56.714 --> 44:59.478
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.

44:59.784 --> 45:03.151
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.

45:03.488 --> 45:05.319
The police surgeon has neither.

45:05.957 --> 45:08.221
- No. Request denied.
- Why?

45:08.459 --> 45:10.324
Are you questioning my decision?

45:10.461 --> 45:12.326
No, sir. I simply want to know why.

45:12.430 --> 45:15.593
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.

45:15.967 --> 45:20.301
You start consulting doctors, and
all sorts of wild notions will be printed.

45:20.505 --> 45:23.065
No one else is to see the bodies.

45:24.842 --> 45:26.332
It is my honor...

45:26.577 --> 45:31.241
...to present this unique
medical phenomenon.

45:32.250 --> 45:35.549
Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick...

45:35.620 --> 45:36.848
John Merrick.

45:36.921 --> 45:38.513
I beg your pardon.

45:38.589 --> 45:43.720
Mr. John Merrick was an attraction
at a side show.

45:44.896 --> 45:49.526
Now he's being cared for
at England's leading hospital.

45:49.867 --> 45:55.066
With your generosity,
we will be able to continue to do so.

45:56.341 --> 45:58.901
Ladies and gentlemen...

45:59.043 --> 46:01.807
...Mr. John Merrick.

46:04.949 --> 46:06.280
Turn around.

46:19.030 --> 46:21.590
It should've been killed at birth.

46:28.306 --> 46:29.796
Good health!

46:38.383 --> 46:41.352
That will be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.

46:58.236 --> 46:59.601
...a psychotic patient.

47:00.038 --> 47:02.063
Pardon me, sir. Are you Dr. Ferral?

47:02.173 --> 47:03.197
I am.

47:04.008 --> 47:06.499
I'm Inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.

47:06.711 --> 47:09.373
Oh, my Lord! You're the Ripper case.

47:09.514 --> 47:11.209
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

47:11.349 --> 47:12.611
Jolly good.

47:12.884 --> 47:16.752
You've come to the perfect place.
We've got butchers aplenty here.

47:17.422 --> 47:18.446
I see.

47:18.523 --> 47:22.357
I could certainly use your expertise
to help solve this case.

47:22.627 --> 47:25.460
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.

47:25.563 --> 47:26.587
Really?

47:27.432 --> 47:31.766
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.

47:32.336 --> 47:35.965
This country's overrun
with foreigners, Orientals.

47:36.808 --> 47:38.537
Jews.

47:38.776 --> 47:43.008
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.

47:43.748 --> 47:47.411
That's who you should be pursuing,
don't you think?

47:48.186 --> 47:51.815
Excuse me.
You don't belong here, do you?

47:53.891 --> 47:57.657
I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.

47:58.896 --> 48:00.557
What's that, sir?

48:01.332 --> 48:02.765
Want of feeling.

48:03.267 --> 48:07.431
He knows everything about anatomy
and nothing about the soul.

48:08.573 --> 48:10.564
How may I assist you, Inspector?

48:10.641 --> 48:12.905
Forgive my ignorance, but...

48:13.444 --> 48:15.071
...are you a surgeon?

48:15.279 --> 48:16.541
I was.

48:17.115 --> 48:20.573
Unfortunately,
I suffered a brain seizure six months ago.

48:20.785 --> 48:25.882
- I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
- Yes, these days I limit myself to teaching.

48:26.491 --> 48:31.155
So you see, I'm accustomed
to answering questions, Inspector.

48:34.465 --> 48:38.367
Could you tell me
what sort of a knife this would be?

48:46.177 --> 48:49.169
I think you mean to draw a Liston knife.

48:49.480 --> 48:52.813
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.

48:52.984 --> 48:55.646
Because there was
no anesthetic on the battlefield...

48:55.786 --> 48:59.381
...he had to carry out
his amputations very quickly.

49:00.091 --> 49:03.356
Do you, by any chance,
have the police surgeon's report available?

49:03.728 --> 49:06.162
- Yes, I do, sir.
- May I?

49:06.964 --> 49:09.159
You must keep this confidential.

49:09.233 --> 49:10.666
Of course.

49:13.471 --> 49:15.098
Thank you.

49:29.353 --> 49:32.083
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?

49:32.156 --> 49:33.919
Not if he cut their throats first.

49:37.328 --> 49:41.128
How can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?

49:41.732 --> 49:42.892
Grapes.

49:44.235 --> 49:46.032
He offers them grapes first.

49:48.072 --> 49:51.701
- Grapes are very tempting.
- They'd gobble them up.

49:51.776 --> 49:55.007
He might offer them a drink
to ease them down.

49:55.146 --> 49:57.080
A drink laced with laudanum.

49:58.716 --> 50:00.547
How do you know that?

50:00.685 --> 50:03.483
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies.

50:03.554 --> 50:05.852
And I smelled the laudanum on their lips.

50:06.157 --> 50:09.615
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

50:09.860 --> 50:13.523
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.

50:17.535 --> 50:20.663
How long have you chased the dragon,
Inspector?

50:25.476 --> 50:27.842
These should help with the headaches.

50:30.581 --> 50:35.109
Opium leaches minerals out of the body,
so I've also given you a tonic.

50:35.486 --> 50:37.750
That'll help to restore your appetite.

50:38.522 --> 50:40.683
Thank you very much, sir.

50:43.461 --> 50:47.158
- I'm a fool.
- I don't think you're a fool.

50:47.698 --> 50:49.063
Far from it.

50:49.267 --> 50:52.930
I ought to have known that you're
physician ordinary to the royal family.

50:53.104 --> 50:57.336
It's certainly an honor, but it's an honor
bestowed on many doctors.

50:57.508 --> 51:02.036
Now, about our friend here.
He cut their throats from left to right.

51:02.113 --> 51:04.377
Therefore, he's right-handed.

51:04.582 --> 51:06.277
Excuse me.

51:06.484 --> 51:10.352
He had to slice
through four layers of tissue...

51:10.588 --> 51:12.886
...and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.

51:13.024 --> 51:14.548
After that...

51:15.426 --> 51:20.193
...he entered the abdominal cavity, so he
would've used more than the Liston knife.

51:20.431 --> 51:24.731
Perhaps he was carrying
a portable amputation kit similar to this.

51:26.037 --> 51:27.732
What do you think?

51:35.780 --> 51:38.476
Is it possible that the killer
is an educated man?

51:38.949 --> 51:43.545
Perhaps someone who studied medicine,
but who is not a surgeon himself?

51:45.089 --> 51:48.684
The intestines are simple enough,
but the uterus?

51:49.126 --> 51:52.391
The liver, very hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.

51:52.463 --> 51:54.931
And he was working quickly, in the dark.

51:55.132 --> 51:57.498
I had held out hope that this...

51:57.968 --> 52:01.460
...monster was a veterinarian or a furrier...

52:01.539 --> 52:04.997
...or an especially well-educated butcher.

52:05.543 --> 52:07.807
No, I must admit, if I were you...

52:09.013 --> 52:13.177
...l'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.

52:14.452 --> 52:16.010
Damn him.

52:45.182 --> 52:47.207
Want me to suck it?

52:47.284 --> 52:49.377
I can suck the Thames dry.

52:50.521 --> 52:52.751
Don't be frightened, dearie.

53:08.205 --> 53:11.902
How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?

53:15.312 --> 53:17.940
No lesions have appeared.

53:18.382 --> 53:21.681
There is some neural damage,
slight trembling of the right hand...

53:21.752 --> 53:25.745
...but I'm more than hopeful,
the treatment will arrest the disease.

53:26.257 --> 53:30.353
He seems, to us,
to be suffering greatly in his mind.

53:30.995 --> 53:33.555
Is the disease affecting his emotions?

53:34.031 --> 53:36.693
Yes, of course, his mood is depressed...

53:36.834 --> 53:40.634
...because of the news of the diagnosis.

53:41.138 --> 53:44.699
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.

53:44.842 --> 53:47.868
You are a true physician, Sir William.

53:48.112 --> 53:51.912
In all ways,
you attend to the health of our empire.

53:52.082 --> 53:53.845
We are grateful.

53:54.118 --> 53:56.086
Thank you, ma'am.

54:10.234 --> 54:14.933
This is the beginning of a five-pointed star.

54:16.106 --> 54:19.041
- Like the bloody Jewish star!
- Withers.

54:19.810 --> 54:22.438
The Inspector is talking,
which means you are what?

54:22.546 --> 54:24.480
- I'm listening, sir.
- Yes.

54:26.417 --> 54:29.443
This area would form a likely point.

54:29.687 --> 54:33.054
I want double shifts
within these streets until further notice.

54:33.123 --> 54:35.921
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.

54:36.060 --> 54:38.392
Stop anyone suspicious...

54:38.562 --> 54:41.087
...including well-dressed gentlemen.

54:41.265 --> 54:42.755
By the way, Withers...

54:43.300 --> 54:46.292
...the Star of David has six points.

54:48.439 --> 54:51.738
Right! "Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

54:53.511 --> 54:54.944
Dismissed!

55:03.787 --> 55:07.587
Why have you called me here?

55:09.093 --> 55:10.993
It's just...

55:11.896 --> 55:15.559
It's just,
you say three more have to be killed.

55:16.567 --> 55:18.432
I can't take it, sir.

55:18.936 --> 55:20.767
It's everywhere.

55:20.938 --> 55:22.872
It's in all the papers.

55:25.409 --> 55:27.673
I'm just a simple chap, sir.

55:27.845 --> 55:30.313
I'm not a great man like you.

55:31.515 --> 55:35.144
I just don't know where I am at anymore.

55:36.854 --> 55:38.879
There, there, Netley.

55:39.790 --> 55:42.623
I shall tell you where we are.

55:45.329 --> 55:50.494
We are in the most extreme
and utter region of the human mind.

55:52.136 --> 55:57.164
A radiant abyss,
where men meet themselves.

55:58.342 --> 56:00.606
I don't understand that.

56:00.878 --> 56:03.244
I don't understand, sir.

56:05.382 --> 56:07.680
Hell, Netley.

56:10.087 --> 56:11.714
We're in Hell.

56:23.334 --> 56:26.963
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

56:32.176 --> 56:34.110
Sorry about that, Inspector.

56:34.244 --> 56:37.907
She's madly in love with me,
although she hides it well.

56:39.149 --> 56:43.085
You said McQueen killed your two friends.
What are you doing here?

56:43.220 --> 56:46.417
I see. Women are butchered
right and left in your district...

56:46.523 --> 56:49.287
...and you can't do piss about it,
and I'm the fool?

56:49.426 --> 56:53.522
We're watching. Can't arrest them
without evidence, so we watch them.

56:53.731 --> 56:56.723
- What else can we do?
- I'll testify.

56:56.934 --> 57:00.529
If you keep meself and me friends alive,
I'll testify.

57:00.704 --> 57:02.103
To what, precisely?

57:02.473 --> 57:05.237
McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him £1 a week.

57:05.342 --> 57:07.503
- No.
- What do you mean, "No"?

57:07.745 --> 57:10.737
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?

57:10.948 --> 57:13.473
I won't. I promise I won't.

57:14.418 --> 57:17.717
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.

57:17.921 --> 57:22.119
But his boys, they'll take their revenge
on you and your friends.

57:23.460 --> 57:25.189
I can't let you do it.

57:30.934 --> 57:33.494
It's your round this time!

57:37.041 --> 57:38.668
I confess, I have an appetite.

57:39.376 --> 57:44.609
One day, I'll be a great big, round woman
with a skinny little man for a husband.

57:45.115 --> 57:48.016
And a dozen plump children, I imagine.

57:49.053 --> 57:50.782
Do you think that's funny?

57:50.854 --> 57:52.947
An unfortunate like me
being a decent mother?

57:53.123 --> 57:55.023
No, I didn't mean that at all.

57:55.192 --> 57:57.160
You'll be a wonderful mother someday.

57:57.294 --> 57:59.319
Honest, I can see it.

57:59.630 --> 58:02.724
I see you in a little cottage by the sea...

58:03.033 --> 58:04.660
...surrounded by children.

58:05.202 --> 58:07.693
I can see it, Mary, clear as day.

58:10.708 --> 58:14.144
- I really do have visions, you know.
- Are you serious?

58:14.411 --> 58:18.108
Sgt. Godley calls it my intuition.

58:19.183 --> 58:22.812
As a matter of fact,
I have one about you in this case.

58:23.954 --> 58:25.945
You have visions about me?

58:26.490 --> 58:27.821
What might those be?

58:31.829 --> 58:33.854
I want you to think carefully.

58:33.997 --> 58:36.932
Besides McQueen,
besides these awful murders...

58:37.000 --> 58:41.903
...has anything happened to you or your
friends that's a bit out of the ordinary?

58:43.640 --> 58:47.098
Ben Kidney?
That's Special Branch she's describing.

58:47.377 --> 58:50.642
What would Ben Kidney and Special Branch
be doing in Whitechapel?

58:50.748 --> 58:51.772
Wait a minute.

58:52.015 --> 58:54.916
She's Irish-born, isn't she?
There's your answer.

58:55.085 --> 58:58.885
A secret Irish rebel.
That's why they'd be after her, right?

58:59.223 --> 59:03.353
They were after Ann Crook, who was
having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.

59:03.761 --> 59:05.456
A man she bore a child...

59:05.829 --> 59:09.265
...a child that's now missing,
along with its grandparents.

59:10.634 --> 59:11.965
Great.

59:12.236 --> 59:14.636
Drive on, please, driver.

59:17.441 --> 59:21.605
You do not fuck with Special Branch.
They fuck with you.

59:29.186 --> 59:32.815
I don't know what you're thinking,
and I don't care to know.

59:39.730 --> 59:43.325
- Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
- Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.

59:43.400 --> 59:45.664
Didn't say where. Could be for the night.

59:45.736 --> 59:48.569
No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,
and I should wait.

59:48.672 --> 59:50.435
Where are you going?

59:51.708 --> 59:53.801
He said I should wait in his office.

59:55.012 --> 59:57.674
And what floor is Mr. Kidney's office on?

59:59.283 --> 01:00:03.617
I don't know what floor, because
I haven't been to his fuckin' office, have I?

01:00:03.987 --> 01:00:08.151
He told me the desk man'd let me up,
but I'm happy to stand here like a knob...

01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:11.393
...because you disobeyed
Ben Kidney's order.

01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:15.560
- It's the second floor on the right.
- Thanks.

01:01:58.268 --> 01:01:59.565
Free Ireland!

01:02:01.939 --> 01:02:03.804
Free Ireland!

01:02:07.844 --> 01:02:08.902
Get inside, sir!

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:25.020
Just some gunpowder, that's all.
Little more than a firework.

01:02:25.963 --> 01:02:27.692
Anyone go in or out?

01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:32.991
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir, there's
an Inspector Abberline in your office.

01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:46.472
No, there's nothing missing here.

01:02:47.484 --> 01:02:50.180
Webster dossier seems to be complete.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:55.416
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell them.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.079
- No.
- Yes.

01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:20.809
No, not together. Too suspicious.

01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:25.212
You wait for me, and if she's in there,
you can visit her on your own.

01:03:25.322 --> 01:03:28.849
I'm going with you right now,
or I'm going to the newspapers.

01:03:30.794 --> 01:03:32.193
I mean it.

01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:44.603
There are a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary to remove...

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:47.074
...the front part of the brain.

01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:50.212
Her records indicate that she was violent...

01:03:50.313 --> 01:03:54.249
...threatening to do harm to herself
and others.

01:03:54.518 --> 01:03:58.010
- Does she have any relations?
- No, she's a ward of the state.

01:03:58.188 --> 01:04:00.452
- That's a lie.
- Listen to me.

01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:03.584
You're under arrest,
and here to assist my investigation.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.424
- Keep your mouth shut! Is that clear?
- Sorry, sir.

01:04:07.164 --> 01:04:08.188
Good.

01:04:09.132 --> 01:04:11.066
What else do you know about her?

01:04:11.134 --> 01:04:14.433
All we know is
that she was an unfortunate...

01:04:14.604 --> 01:04:17.129
...who lived in the Whitechapel district.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:20.267
I'd like to ask her a few questions.

01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:24.079
You won't get any sense out of her.

01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:26.548
I'm used to that.

01:04:39.996 --> 01:04:41.020
Hello.

01:04:41.832 --> 01:04:43.629
I brought Mary Kelly.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.563
Do you remember Mary Kelly?

01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:51.337
Ann, you know me,
I'm your best friend in all the world.

01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:53.371
Go away.

01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.475
Go away.

01:04:58.181 --> 01:05:01.708
I'm going to find baby Alice.
I'm going to take care of her.

01:05:02.786 --> 01:05:04.947
Alice is laughing to me.

01:05:07.557 --> 01:05:09.889
Laughing to me all day long.

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.689
It's all right, darling.

01:05:13.363 --> 01:05:14.762
What about her father?

01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:18.698
Have you seen Alice's father, Ann?

01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:22.868
He's a prince.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.007
A prince.

01:05:27.978 --> 01:05:29.536
And I'm a queen.

01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:37.010
How do you know he was a painter?

01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:39.816
He hired us to pose as artist's models.

01:05:39.923 --> 01:05:42.756
What exactly does that entail,
artist's models?

01:05:43.627 --> 01:05:46.255
We stood very still, so he could paint us.

01:05:47.063 --> 01:05:49.588
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?

01:05:49.699 --> 01:05:52.099
I'm sorry, I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:54.102
England doesn't have whores...

01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:57.071
...just a great mass
of very unlucky women.

01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:59.842
So Ann Crook...

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:03.001
...and the painter became lovers.
Is that it?

01:06:03.146 --> 01:06:06.172
He married her in a lovely Catholic church.

01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:09.512
Saint Savior's.
I was a witness, as a matter of fact.

01:06:09.653 --> 01:06:11.848
Married her in a Catholic church?

01:06:13.523 --> 01:06:16.321
What do you think they've done
to baby Alice?

01:06:19.296 --> 01:06:21.821
Special Branch dumped her
in Bishopsgate?

01:06:22.132 --> 01:06:24.623
Yeah, as an unknown.

01:06:25.035 --> 01:06:26.229
Why?

01:06:26.803 --> 01:06:29.033
When I find out, I'll tell you.

01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:33.004
- Take me to her. You have to.
- No. Not yet.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.839
I need to know more first.

01:06:36.947 --> 01:06:38.278
Look...

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:43.208
...I promise that I'll help you
with baby Alice, but not yet.

01:06:43.753 --> 01:06:46.813
You've got to trust me, Mary,
at least a little bit.

01:06:48.325 --> 01:06:51.317
I do. I do trust you.

01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:52.685
Good.

01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:56.863
Do you have little ones, Inspector?

01:06:57.133 --> 01:06:58.157
No.

01:07:02.138 --> 01:07:04.732
A year ago... No, two years...

01:07:05.909 --> 01:07:08.207
I'm sorry, more than two years...

01:07:08.878 --> 01:07:12.211
...my wife passed away...

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.514
...giving birth to what I'm told was a son.

01:07:16.519 --> 01:07:17.884
I'm sorry.

01:07:19.155 --> 01:07:20.383
Thanks.

01:07:25.895 --> 01:07:28.728
I want to show you some paintings
on the way out.

01:07:28.832 --> 01:07:32.359
- You're going to take me into the gallery?
- Why not?

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:34.767
Come on.

01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:01.061
- Did you see the look on her face?
- I think she stopped breathing.

01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:07.600
She's a fright.

01:08:08.104 --> 01:08:09.799
Look at those cold eyes.

01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:13.608
I feel like someone's walking
over my grave.

01:08:13.743 --> 01:08:16.268
There's one more painting
I want you to see.

01:08:34.596 --> 01:08:36.531
You know him, don't you?

01:08:37.434 --> 01:08:41.370
"Those whom God has joined together,
let no man put asunder."

01:08:42.272 --> 01:08:45.867
I pronounce that they be man and wife.

01:09:01.057 --> 01:09:05.118
- Sir William Gull, please.
- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.

01:09:07.863 --> 01:09:12.198
Sir William? It's Inspector Abberline.
I need to speak with you, sir.

01:09:12.535 --> 01:09:15.765
Sir William is ill.
He can't receive any visitors.

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:20.170
I said...

01:09:21.511 --> 01:09:23.341
...you can't go in.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:26.313
It's all right, Dr. Ferral,
I don't mind company.

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:29.010
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you please?

01:09:35.058 --> 01:09:39.825
I wish I could tell you
that your story was fantastical.

01:09:42.131 --> 01:09:43.895
Unhappily, I cannot.

01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:49.497
I know for a fact that the Prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.207
And I suppose
that it's more than possible...

01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:55.972
...he concocted this elaborate deception...

01:09:56.312 --> 01:09:59.611
...to have some privacy
while he indulged in his secret life.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.344
But I know one reason I have for stating...

01:10:03.753 --> 01:10:08.247
...that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.

01:10:09.526 --> 01:10:10.891
What's that, sir?

01:10:13.997 --> 01:10:17.831
If you repeat what I'm about to tell you,
both our lives are in jeopardy.

01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:20.699
Indeed, I hope for your sake
that what I'm about to say...

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:23.705
...will steer you clear
of the very real danger you're in.

01:10:23.807 --> 01:10:26.537
I think I'm well past
the point of safe return, sir.

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:30.707
Prince Edward has syphilis.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.477
Not a pleasant state secret, but a vital one.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.451
That proves it.

01:10:39.856 --> 01:10:43.417
I couldn't understand why the Prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends...

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:47.987
...especially so savagely,
but he's not merely killing them...

01:10:49.432 --> 01:10:51.093
...he's punishing them.

01:10:51.568 --> 01:10:53.866
He wants revenge. Don't you see, sir?

01:10:53.937 --> 01:10:56.303
No, Inspector, I don't see.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.137
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the Prince's mental state...

01:11:01.678 --> 01:11:05.671
...clever though they may be,
can't overcome the physical impossibility...

01:11:05.782 --> 01:11:07.579
...of his committing these crimes.

01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:12.587
The disease is far enough along
that his hands tremble uncontrollably.

01:11:13.022 --> 01:11:17.755
He's very weak, and the killings
of Jack the Ripper require sure hands...

01:11:17.961 --> 01:11:19.622
...and considerable vigor.

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:23.494
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?

01:11:24.634 --> 01:11:26.534
Whatever else the Prince may be...

01:11:26.603 --> 01:11:29.367
...he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.

01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:11.547
...to the center of the lodge
and force him to kneel...

01:12:11.614 --> 01:12:13.741
...for the benefit of prayer.

01:12:19.322 --> 01:12:22.814
Vouchsafe Thy name,
almighty Father of the universe...

01:12:22.892 --> 01:12:25.383
...to this, our present convention.

01:12:27.397 --> 01:12:28.796
Who is this?

01:12:29.532 --> 01:12:32.126
A poor candidate in a state of darkness.

01:12:32.702 --> 01:12:36.468
He comes of his own free will,
perfectly prepared...

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.931
...humbly soliciting to be admitted...

01:12:40.109 --> 01:12:43.169
...into the mysteries and privileges.

01:12:43.479 --> 01:12:48.644
In all cases of danger and distress,
in whom do you put your trust?

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:50.646
In God.

01:12:51.654 --> 01:12:54.555
How did he find out
about the unfortunate and her child?

01:12:55.224 --> 01:12:59.456
He has that kind of cleverness you'll
sometimes find in the middle classes.

01:12:59.996 --> 01:13:03.693
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.

01:13:06.002 --> 01:13:08.470
Thank God that's not something
you're burdened by.

01:13:08.538 --> 01:13:09.596
Yes, thank God.

01:13:09.939 --> 01:13:11.634
Recite the solemn oath.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:15.171
"Never to reveal our secrets...

01:13:15.445 --> 01:13:20.178
"...under no less a penalty
than my throat be cut across...

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:23.948
"...my tongue be torn out by its root...

01:13:24.654 --> 01:13:28.647
"...and that I be buried in sand
a cable's length from shore."

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.951
You don't think
Gull has confided in him, do you?

01:13:33.129 --> 01:13:35.893
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?

01:13:36.799 --> 01:13:37.857
No.

01:13:38.368 --> 01:13:40.359
He's not that foolish.

01:13:44.607 --> 01:13:46.905
Let the brother receive the light.

01:13:59.822 --> 01:14:02.814
- I keep on hearing...
...no time to scream...

01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:05.551
Another beautiful murder.

01:14:07.096 --> 01:14:09.360
Fear me. Jack the Ripper.

01:14:10.366 --> 01:14:11.993
They're rubbish. You know that.

01:14:12.068 --> 01:14:14.366
Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.

01:14:14.437 --> 01:14:17.702
But why you believe
that red-headed jezebel, I'll never know.

01:14:17.774 --> 01:14:21.232
Has it occurred to you
that she likes to make up stories?

01:14:21.344 --> 01:14:24.245
Particularly about men.
She is after all, a whore.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.972
She's a woman who...

01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:30.878
"A rose by any other name"?

01:14:31.788 --> 01:14:32.982
Is that it?

01:14:34.323 --> 01:14:37.986
Frederick, my dear chum,
no one is more delighted than I am...

01:14:38.094 --> 01:14:42.428
...that you decided to resume your interest
in the fairer sex, but please remember...

01:14:42.498 --> 01:14:46.298
...a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.

01:14:46.402 --> 01:14:47.892
- Sgt. Godley.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:48.004 --> 01:14:49.631
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.

01:14:49.739 --> 01:14:52.401
- Right away.
- I tried to stop them, Inspector.

01:14:52.475 --> 01:14:54.466
This arrived in this afternoon's post.

01:14:56.646 --> 01:15:00.173
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman preserved for you...

01:15:00.316 --> 01:15:04.218
"...the other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."

01:15:04.387 --> 01:15:07.481
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.

01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:09.449
"From Hell."

01:15:10.626 --> 01:15:12.856
At least they got the address right.

01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:16.591
It can't be. Are you sure he was the same?

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:19.294
I know him. I posed for him twice meself.

01:15:19.402 --> 01:15:22.769
I stood there naked as a babe,
watching him paint me for hours.

01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:25.569
And he was with Ann for what,
over a year?

01:15:25.675 --> 01:15:27.074
Nearly two.

01:15:29.879 --> 01:15:32.609
Here you are. Hello, girls.

01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:35.247
I told you to wait for me.

01:15:35.318 --> 01:15:38.583
I can't stay in a pub and not have a drink.

01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:41.452
It's cruel. But look who I bumped into.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.114
Remember Ada?

01:15:44.927 --> 01:15:46.394
She's from France.

01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:47.520
Bruxelles.

01:15:52.201 --> 01:15:54.396
She is pretty, isn't she?

01:15:56.372 --> 01:15:58.966
Not in public, love.

01:15:59.175 --> 01:16:02.576
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.

01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:05.942
Ada, you stay where you are.

01:16:06.415 --> 01:16:09.009
Come on, Mary, get the drinks in.

01:16:19.395 --> 01:16:22.523
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.

01:16:22.598 --> 01:16:25.863
- I can keep them that long.
- That's something, anyway.

01:16:25.968 --> 01:16:27.196
Thank you.

01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:30.900
What about baby Alice?
Are you sure she's all right?

01:16:31.007 --> 01:16:33.908
She's all right.
We'll get her out after this is over.

01:16:34.343 --> 01:16:35.640
"We'll get her"?

01:16:36.012 --> 01:16:37.309
Listen.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:41.282
I want you and your friends off the street
until I can sort this thing out.

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.978
- For how long?
- A few days at least.

01:16:44.086 --> 01:16:48.250
You better throw us in jail because
we have no money for food or a doss.

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:50.283
All right, take this.

01:16:51.427 --> 01:16:54.396
Buy some food, get a room, and stay there.

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.722
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.

01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:03.163
In three days, come to the Ten Bells,
I'll leave a message with the barkeep.

01:17:07.977 --> 01:17:09.001
What?

01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.043
It's not enough?

01:17:11.147 --> 01:17:14.639
I wish I could show you the little village
where I was born.

01:17:14.817 --> 01:17:16.478
It's so lovely there.

01:17:17.787 --> 01:17:20.585
It's by the sea,
where you said you saw me.

01:17:21.424 --> 01:17:24.655
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in...

01:17:25.328 --> 01:17:27.387
...but now I'm not so sure.

01:17:32.568 --> 01:17:33.592
Don't.

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:35.794
What?

01:17:36.639 --> 01:17:38.539
Do you think I'm paying you back?

01:17:38.774 --> 01:17:41.004
I didn't mean it as business.

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:42.407
I'm still a woman.

01:17:42.511 --> 01:17:45.446
They haven't taken that away from me,
not yet anyways.

01:17:58.661 --> 01:17:59.821
Enough of that.

01:18:01.964 --> 01:18:03.727
Now, lad, at least take...

01:18:06.369 --> 01:18:07.563
Sorry, sir.

01:18:30.526 --> 01:18:32.050
One more turn.

01:18:34.196 --> 01:18:36.061
And curtsy.

01:18:38.634 --> 01:18:39.794
And we're done.

01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:51.408
Don't be modest, girl.

01:18:52.014 --> 01:18:53.606
They don't care what we do.

01:19:01.357 --> 01:19:03.382
I paid for your supper, remember.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.787
Stop shaking your head at me, you slag!

01:19:07.863 --> 01:19:10.855
- Leave her alone!
- She's my business, not yours!

01:19:10.967 --> 01:19:15.768
- Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
- No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!

01:19:16.439 --> 01:19:19.670
Don't go out tonight, it's not safe.

01:19:19.775 --> 01:19:22.141
I'll just get something to sustain myself.

01:19:22.244 --> 01:19:24.610
- I'll be right back!
- Don't be so fucking stupid!

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.140
- Do without for a night.
- No. I want a fucking drink.

01:19:33.055 --> 01:19:34.249
Here we are.

01:19:34.323 --> 01:19:35.381
Service records.

01:19:35.491 --> 01:19:40.019
"Grenadier Guards. Lt. Benjamin Kidney."

01:19:40.863 --> 01:19:41.887
There.

01:19:42.565 --> 01:19:44.089
Just as you suspected.

01:19:45.468 --> 01:19:47.663
Before he joined Special Branch...

01:19:47.903 --> 01:19:50.167
...Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:53.570
Part of his duties included
assisting a field surgeon.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:57.138
Let me tell you something of which
I am absolutely certain.

01:19:57.246 --> 01:20:01.080
Assisting an expert is a different thing,
a very different thing...

01:20:01.183 --> 01:20:02.707
...from doing it oneself.

01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:05.821
Think about it.
Someone's got to clean up after the Prince.

01:20:06.022 --> 01:20:08.820
Whose job is it to take care
of the widow's messes?

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:11.457
You've turned into Othello,
do you know that?

01:20:11.627 --> 01:20:14.653
Everything is a suspicion.
And like that tragic Moor...

01:20:14.764 --> 01:20:17.358
...all your suspicions will end up
in your own demise.

01:20:17.466 --> 01:20:20.594
Heaven's sake,
these women aren't just being silenced.

01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:24.400
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?

01:20:24.473 --> 01:20:25.963
To scare people.

01:20:26.142 --> 01:20:28.940
- To keep their mind off the real point.
- Which is?

01:20:29.245 --> 01:20:31.372
Think what's at stake for Special Branch.

01:20:31.547 --> 01:20:34.880
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:39.046
Married her in a Catholic church,
they had a baby, a legitimate baby...

01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:42.887
...who is in fact
heir to the throne of England.

01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:44.619
All these women were there.

01:20:45.094 --> 01:20:47.927
All these women were eyewitnesses
to an event...

01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:51.263
...that could rip the empire to pieces.

01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:02.103
Once she starts drinking,
she'll go all night, you know that.

01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:06.544
- She knows how dangerous it is.
- She don't believe you about the Prince.

01:21:06.715 --> 01:21:10.446
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.

01:21:17.093 --> 01:21:18.526
Hello, sir.

01:21:19.762 --> 01:21:22.731
Is anything wrong, my dear?

01:21:22.898 --> 01:21:26.834
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.

01:21:29.672 --> 01:21:31.037
Thirsty?

01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:40.012
Always parched, sir.

01:21:42.017 --> 01:21:45.248
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby
that we might go...

01:21:45.321 --> 01:21:48.620
...while my coachman keeps watch.

01:21:48.858 --> 01:21:49.916
Yeah.

01:21:53.295 --> 01:21:54.489
This way.

01:21:54.897 --> 01:21:55.989
Follow me.

01:22:25.127 --> 01:22:26.389
It's this way.

01:22:27.596 --> 01:22:28.790
Follow me.

01:22:32.168 --> 01:22:33.829
I dropped my grapes.

01:22:52.888 --> 01:22:53.912
No!

01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:57.525
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:02.654
Shut up!

01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.216
I hear someone coming, sir.

01:23:31.327 --> 01:23:32.385
Sir!

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.649
It's one of them, isn't it?

01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:02.557
The throat's cut the same way.

01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:03.915
Yeah.

01:24:04.994 --> 01:24:06.484
He didn't finish.

01:24:07.796 --> 01:24:09.787
She's no less dead for that.

01:24:11.734 --> 01:24:13.861
He won't be satisfied by this.

01:24:18.307 --> 01:24:19.638
Wilkins.

01:24:21.777 --> 01:24:24.905
Fetch the ambulance. Go on, run along.

01:25:08.424 --> 01:25:10.449
Excuse me, miss.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.158
You could be dead...

01:25:53.936 --> 01:25:55.130
...right now.

01:25:56.271 --> 01:25:58.831
But then there would be
too many bloody questions.

01:26:02.044 --> 01:26:04.205
Ignore the old man's blathering.

01:26:04.713 --> 01:26:08.911
Find a scapegoat,
or next time we won't care who asks:

01:26:09.351 --> 01:26:12.320
"Whatever happened
to Inspector Abberline?"

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.549
We should hurry up, sir. It's clearing up.

01:26:43.218 --> 01:26:45.778
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?

01:26:46.588 --> 01:26:48.078
Chalk, sir?

01:26:49.057 --> 01:26:52.026
They found another one in Mitre Square!

01:27:16.885 --> 01:27:20.719
Nice work, Inspector.
You've encouraged him to do two a night.

01:27:20.789 --> 01:27:22.882
Out of the fucking way.

01:27:30.999 --> 01:27:32.660
Catherine Eddowes.

01:27:34.236 --> 01:27:36.966
There's some writing on the wall,
just down the road.

01:27:37.039 --> 01:27:38.734
You should have a look at it.

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:44.004
"The Jews are the men
that will not be blamed for nothing."

01:27:44.313 --> 01:27:46.941
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.284
Madam, slow down.

01:27:54.923 --> 01:27:57.289
Make sure you get the apron as well.

01:28:08.203 --> 01:28:10.364
It was written by the killer, sir.

01:28:10.973 --> 01:28:12.736
And how do you know that?

01:28:13.075 --> 01:28:15.873
I was here three quarters of an hour ago.

01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:19.508
This building, mostly Jews live here.
Is that right?

01:28:19.715 --> 01:28:21.148
Yeah, that's right.

01:28:21.216 --> 01:28:22.376
Ready now, sir.

01:28:22.484 --> 01:28:24.975
Put that away,
and get out of here immediately.

01:28:27.656 --> 01:28:28.987
Abberline?

01:28:29.658 --> 01:28:31.626
- Wash that off.
- What?

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.990
- You heard me.
- It's evidence, sir.

01:28:34.096 --> 01:28:35.324
Listen to me.

01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:39.958
In another hour, there will be
1,000 people poking about in here.

01:28:40.168 --> 01:28:43.763
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.

01:28:43.906 --> 01:28:47.103
We'll have mayhem on the streets,
so wash it off.

01:28:47.643 --> 01:28:51.579
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.

01:28:51.713 --> 01:28:54.944
- Look for yourself.
- I don't have to look, I've seen it.

01:28:55.951 --> 01:28:58.852
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."

01:28:58.921 --> 01:29:00.445
I don't know what this refers to...

01:29:00.522 --> 01:29:04.583
...but I'm sure it's got nothing to do
with the people who live around here.

01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:11.293
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.

01:29:12.668 --> 01:29:14.568
What are you looking to him for?

01:29:14.803 --> 01:29:16.236
Wash it off!

01:29:16.572 --> 01:29:17.869
Yes, sir.

01:29:19.975 --> 01:29:23.308
Six men have seen it already,
the Sergeant has copied it down.

01:29:23.412 --> 01:29:25.903
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.

01:29:26.014 --> 01:29:29.006
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.

01:29:29.084 --> 01:29:32.815
No, all I am doing is taking charge
of an investigation...

01:29:32.888 --> 01:29:37.757
...that you have bungled to the point
of gross inefficiency, and I've had enough.

01:29:38.594 --> 01:29:41.062
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.

01:29:42.898 --> 01:29:45.389
Inspector Abberline is suspended.

01:29:46.401 --> 01:29:48.631
All of his privileges are cancelled.

01:30:05.153 --> 01:30:07.246
You have not seen her, then?

01:30:08.223 --> 01:30:10.885
If she comes around, give her this.

01:30:13.228 --> 01:30:14.593
Long letter, eh?

01:30:16.798 --> 01:30:18.265
This is for your trouble.

01:30:20.302 --> 01:30:22.566
The letter's private, you understand?

01:30:22.838 --> 01:30:24.328
I understand.

01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:16.616
Who is this?

01:31:21.863 --> 01:31:23.854
Recite the solemn oath.

01:31:23.965 --> 01:31:25.990
"Never to reveal our secrets..."

01:31:45.954 --> 01:31:47.615
Grapes again.

01:31:49.224 --> 01:31:50.555
Why grapes?

01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:53.083
This ain't killing for profit.

01:31:53.595 --> 01:31:55.392
He's not that foolish.

01:31:55.597 --> 01:31:58.361
- Are you questioning my decision?
- Find a scapegoat.

01:32:00.035 --> 01:32:02.026
"...my throat be cut across..."

01:32:02.304 --> 01:32:03.635
This is ritual.

01:33:12.641 --> 01:33:17.578
"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."

01:33:18.847 --> 01:33:19.871
Jews.

01:33:51.479 --> 01:33:54.039
It's me, Ada. Only me.

01:33:55.383 --> 01:33:58.045
I bring everything for supper.

01:34:01.089 --> 01:34:03.148
You little thief, I need this money.

01:34:03.258 --> 01:34:07.695
I just take some money and buy food,
for me and for you. Is that bad, Mary?

01:34:09.464 --> 01:34:12.490
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen...

01:34:13.401 --> 01:34:16.564
...until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.

01:34:16.838 --> 01:34:18.135
Understand?

01:34:19.407 --> 01:34:21.068
I stay with Mary.

01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:23.200
Beautiful Mary.

01:34:24.079 --> 01:34:27.537
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.

01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:28.773
Pardon?

01:34:31.786 --> 01:34:33.686
Here's to our feast.

01:35:09.024 --> 01:35:12.152
I'm so sorry to greet you like this,
Inspector...

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.187
...but I'm late for an appointment.

01:35:14.262 --> 01:35:17.891
Will you excuse me
if I finish dressing while we talk?

01:35:18.033 --> 01:35:19.967
- Please, go on.
- Thank you.

01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:24.839
I'd like to speak to you
about the Freemasons, if I might.

01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.964
Yes.

01:35:27.809 --> 01:35:31.370
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet...

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.909
...and also the locations of the bodies...

01:35:37.319 --> 01:35:39.150
...form a pentacle star.

01:35:39.521 --> 01:35:42.581
A pentacle star is the symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not?

01:35:42.657 --> 01:35:43.715
Yes.

01:35:45.927 --> 01:35:48.122
And the way that these women
were killed...

01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:50.629
...throats cut left to right...

01:35:52.133 --> 01:35:54.124
...their organs removed.

01:35:56.237 --> 01:35:59.070
They're reenactments, aren't they?

01:36:01.209 --> 01:36:03.040
Reenactments of what?

01:36:03.778 --> 01:36:05.006
The Jews.

01:36:06.414 --> 01:36:09.508
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons.

01:36:09.651 --> 01:36:11.676
That's how they were executed.

01:36:11.853 --> 01:36:15.380
Yes, so the Great Book tells us.

01:36:16.758 --> 01:36:20.387
So Jack the Ripper
isn't just merely killing whores.

01:36:21.596 --> 01:36:23.564
He's executing traitors.

01:36:24.032 --> 01:36:26.523
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.

01:36:26.868 --> 01:36:29.063
Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector...

01:36:29.137 --> 01:36:31.537
...that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:34.337
I don't want to arrest him.

01:36:37.412 --> 01:36:40.074
The Ripper has one more traitor
yet to kill...

01:36:40.715 --> 01:36:42.808
...and I will stop him.

01:36:48.289 --> 01:36:50.189
Did they come to you, sir...

01:36:51.393 --> 01:36:53.054
...as a loyal Mason?

01:36:54.496 --> 01:36:58.159
Did they ask you to help them
cover up the Prince's secret marriage?

01:37:01.469 --> 01:37:03.460
That's how it started, yes.

01:37:04.439 --> 01:37:07.272
And then you discovered
the Prince had syphilis.

01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:11.570
He's going to die of it, Inspector.

01:37:13.381 --> 01:37:16.373
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?

01:37:19.154 --> 01:37:22.487
You're physician in ordinary to the Queen...

01:37:24.125 --> 01:37:27.652
...entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.

01:37:28.797 --> 01:37:33.496
Only you had reason to believe
that these unfortunates...

01:37:34.335 --> 01:37:36.030
...these whores...

01:37:36.638 --> 01:37:38.970
...these traitors...

01:37:40.675 --> 01:37:42.802
...destroyed your life's work.

01:37:51.653 --> 01:37:54.053
Below the skin of history...

01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:57.217
...are London's veins.

01:37:57.959 --> 01:38:00.655
These symbols, the mitre...

01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:02.821
...the pentacle star...

01:38:03.465 --> 01:38:08.300
...even someone as ignorant
and degenerate as you...

01:38:09.204 --> 01:38:13.573
...can sense that they course
with energy and meaning.

01:38:17.145 --> 01:38:18.908
I am that meaning.

01:38:21.316 --> 01:38:22.908
I am that energy.

01:38:30.892 --> 01:38:34.123
One day, men will look back...

01:38:36.131 --> 01:38:39.726
...and say I gave birth to the 20th century.

01:38:46.641 --> 01:38:48.871
You're not going to see the 20th century.

01:39:30.652 --> 01:39:32.552
Roll up his sleeve.

01:39:37.692 --> 01:39:39.250
Don't struggle.

01:39:40.595 --> 01:39:42.586
You'll only make this more painful.

01:41:05.346 --> 01:41:07.007
Are you all right?

01:41:07.282 --> 01:41:09.409
There's someone under there.

01:43:07.769 --> 01:43:08.963
Dr. Gull?

01:43:13.107 --> 01:43:15.667
You were describing the human heart.

01:43:23.584 --> 01:43:25.643
The human heart...

01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:28.778
...is a dense and powerful muscle...

01:43:30.458 --> 01:43:33.450
...much like the organic equivalent
of mahogany...

01:43:34.595 --> 01:43:39.362
...and notoriously difficult to burn.

01:43:43.204 --> 01:43:45.035
It's about the size of a fist.

01:43:47.008 --> 01:43:50.375
It provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.

01:43:52.046 --> 01:43:57.040
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles and four valves.

01:43:59.053 --> 01:44:02.284
It is, in effect, a single pump...

01:44:03.257 --> 01:44:05.919
...powering a double circuit.

01:44:07.862 --> 01:44:12.526
In the adult, the heart rate averages
70 to 80 beats a minute.

01:44:15.570 --> 01:44:18.095
Such is the force of the heart beat...

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:25.878
...that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...

01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:29.177
...a six-foot jet of blood...

01:44:30.618 --> 01:44:32.677
...is released.

01:45:14.862 --> 01:45:16.420
...fear no God.

01:45:17.265 --> 01:45:18.493
Arise.

01:45:19.934 --> 01:45:21.902
Your faith is well-founded.

01:45:57.538 --> 01:45:59.028
Another murder!

01:46:01.442 --> 01:46:03.467
Don't go in there. There's no need.

01:46:04.111 --> 01:46:05.635
How bad is it?

01:46:07.548 --> 01:46:09.539
She's in pieces, sir.

01:46:10.117 --> 01:46:12.278
Sergeant, he can go in.

01:46:24.498 --> 01:46:26.022
Give him to me.

01:46:26.133 --> 01:46:28.158
He'll be taken care of. I swear.

01:46:28.235 --> 01:46:31.727
- I want him.
- It's over. He's done. I give you my word.

01:46:31.839 --> 01:46:32.863
Fuck your word!

01:46:32.974 --> 01:46:36.375
I'll bring every last one
of you fucking cunts down.

01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:38.478
You and your fucking brothers.

01:46:38.613 --> 01:46:39.978
Listen to me.

01:46:40.147 --> 01:46:44.243
Your difficult situation
has been thoroughly discussed.

01:46:44.652 --> 01:46:48.520
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.

01:46:51.459 --> 01:46:54.155
No! This is not helping anything.

01:46:56.063 --> 01:46:59.055
Don't be a fool, Inspector.

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:02.736
You will be very closely watched.

01:47:02.970 --> 01:47:06.497
You're all there now.
Where were you when this was happening?

01:47:06.641 --> 01:47:09.769
All right for you, standing around chatting.
What about us?

01:47:10.277 --> 01:47:13.212
Inspector Abberline is in charge.

01:47:13.614 --> 01:47:16.640
Give him all the assistance he requires.

01:47:25.559 --> 01:47:27.720
Remember, you're being watched.

01:47:28.763 --> 01:47:31.960
Men, clear this passage. Move them away.

01:47:32.166 --> 01:47:33.531
Move back. Make way, you.

01:47:40.875 --> 01:47:43.173
Shall we proceed, Inspector?

01:48:03.264 --> 01:48:05.323
Body lies in middle of bed.

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.896
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.

01:48:10.705 --> 01:48:12.935
The left arm is close to the body.

01:48:13.474 --> 01:48:17.604
The forearm flexed at a right angle,
resting across the abdomen.

01:48:18.546 --> 01:48:22.710
The right arm is slightly abducted
from the body.

01:48:23.150 --> 01:48:27.985
It rests on the mattress with
the elbow bent and the forearm supine.

01:48:29.023 --> 01:48:32.891
The fingers are clenched,
indicating a struggle as she died.

01:48:34.328 --> 01:48:36.387
Notice something, Inspector?

01:48:37.665 --> 01:48:38.825
No.

01:48:40.601 --> 01:48:41.932
No, go on.

01:48:47.341 --> 01:48:50.640
Came in not long before dawn,
in a bit of a rush.

01:48:50.811 --> 01:48:52.506
Left this for you.

01:49:00.187 --> 01:49:02.382
"I know you asked me to wait.

01:49:02.523 --> 01:49:06.653
"If I'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.

01:49:07.194 --> 01:49:10.220
"I'm going to the orphanage
to collect baby Alice.

01:49:10.498 --> 01:49:12.830
"Here's an address where you can find us.

01:49:12.933 --> 01:49:15.026
"We'll wait for you eagerly.

01:49:15.136 --> 01:49:19.835
"I know in my heart,
we can be happy living by the sea.

01:49:20.107 --> 01:49:22.075
"Just as you saw.

01:49:22.743 --> 01:49:25.268
"I hope to be with you soon, dearest.

01:49:25.646 --> 01:49:28.171
"All my love, Mary."

01:49:40.528 --> 01:49:43.429
We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.

01:49:43.931 --> 01:49:48.595
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and throne.

01:49:49.036 --> 01:49:52.096
Not to engage in these ghastly rituals.

01:49:52.673 --> 01:49:56.507
Of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.

01:49:56.877 --> 01:49:59.744
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.

01:49:59.914 --> 01:50:02.144
The threat is past, Your Majesty.

01:50:02.650 --> 01:50:05.710
In his way, Sir William has been loyal.

01:50:06.153 --> 01:50:08.519
And we are grateful for that.

01:50:08.889 --> 01:50:11.585
The rest is in your hands, Lord Hallsham.

01:50:12.126 --> 01:50:15.027
We wish to hear nothing further of this.

01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:18.361
Knight of the East.

01:50:18.632 --> 01:50:21.157
We are gathered here,
beneath the God of love...

01:50:21.402 --> 01:50:25.099
...and before the sight
of the Great Architect, to judge this case.

01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:30.468
You stand accused of mayhems that
have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.

01:50:30.644 --> 01:50:34.273
You stand before your peers,
Masons and doctors both.

01:50:34.748 --> 01:50:37.342
I have no peers present here.

01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:38.713
What?

01:50:39.053 --> 01:50:42.022
No man amongst you is fit to judge...

01:50:42.389 --> 01:50:45.153
...the mighty art that I have wrought.

01:50:46.227 --> 01:50:50.926
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand nor live by.

01:50:54.635 --> 01:50:57.035
The Great Architect speaks to me.

01:50:57.805 --> 01:51:01.468
He is the balance,
where my deeds are weighed and judged.

01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:04.800
Not you.

01:51:06.213 --> 01:51:07.612
Knight of the East...

01:51:08.082 --> 01:51:09.947
...hear our judgment.

01:52:00.467 --> 01:52:02.560
They're not watching you anymore.

01:52:07.241 --> 01:52:10.506
I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.

01:52:11.278 --> 01:52:13.041
They think she's dead.

01:52:13.213 --> 01:52:16.148
If I disappear,
or change my routine suddenly...

01:52:16.483 --> 01:52:18.644
...they might wonder why.

01:52:19.253 --> 01:52:21.517
You know who you're going to turn into?

01:52:21.689 --> 01:52:24.988
That old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside...

01:52:25.092 --> 01:52:29.426
...because as soon as he's had a few drinks,
he goes on about the girl who got away.

01:52:29.496 --> 01:52:30.963
Is that what you want?

01:52:31.165 --> 01:52:34.066
Do you want to live the rest of your life
like a ghost?

01:52:34.735 --> 01:52:36.100
No.

01:52:38.072 --> 01:52:40.700
What I want is to go to her.

01:52:41.909 --> 01:52:45.936
But at the slightest hint she's alive,
they will spare no expense...

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.747
...and no trouble.

01:52:48.215 --> 01:52:49.773
So I'll stay.

01:52:50.551 --> 01:52:51.916
And watch them.

01:53:29.556 --> 01:53:31.922
Alice!

01:53:32.393 --> 01:53:34.224
Come here, darling.

01:53:38.999 --> 01:53:40.660
Coming, Mother.

01:54:24.611 --> 01:54:25.805
Get up.

01:54:27.748 --> 01:54:30.342
Get up! Come on.

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.995
"Good night, sweet prince."
