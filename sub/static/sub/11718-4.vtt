<i>What's cooking, Max?</i>

03:58.903 --> 04:02.555
One right hand
of a John Doe murder vic.

04:02.607 --> 04:04.941
Approximately
30 to 40 years old.

04:05.026 --> 04:06.943
- Where's the rest of him?
- The Coast Guard is dragging

04:07.028 --> 04:10.530
the shorelines of Waikiki Beach
where the hand was found.

04:10.581 --> 04:12.332
Why are we tagging
this guy a homicide?

04:12.399 --> 04:14.734
This guy-- it's a hand.
He could be shark food.

04:14.785 --> 04:17.921
Blood had elevated
levels of lead,

04:18.005 --> 04:20.040
indicating the victim
was indeed shot.

04:20.091 --> 04:22.792
The hand was then
severed postmortem

04:22.877 --> 04:24.794
by something sharp enough
to cut through a bone.

04:24.879 --> 04:28.014
Most likely a boat rotor
cut through a body dump.

04:29.634 --> 04:32.752
All right, what are you doing?

04:32.803 --> 04:34.855
MAX
We're dealing with a wet body,

04:34.922 --> 04:36.223
so after 24 hours
of submersion,

04:36.274 --> 04:37.691
the skin separates
from the dermis.

04:37.758 --> 04:38.975
Try to roll a print

04:39.060 --> 04:40.727
and you only get
a black smudge.

04:40.778 --> 04:42.195
But the outer
layer of the skin

04:42.263 --> 04:44.898
actually maintains its ridging.

04:46.934 --> 04:50.370
All you need is an extra set of
hands and you're in business.

04:54.742 --> 04:58.044
You're putting the guy's
hand like it's a glove.

04:58.112 --> 05:00.780
Max, that's disgusting.

05:00.831 --> 05:03.466
Yes, but very effective.

05:09.323 --> 05:11.457
Sweet. We got a hit.

05:11.509 --> 05:14.394
The victim's name
is Blake Spencer.

05:14.461 --> 05:16.646
Okay, got a local address?

05:20.167 --> 05:22.102
Sir, we're told
Blake Spencer lives here?

05:22.153 --> 05:25.138
Sure, it's the apartment
above the bar. Why?

05:25.189 --> 05:27.774
Blake Spencer was found
murdered this morning.

05:27.825 --> 05:31.077
Murdered?

05:31.145 --> 05:32.478
I don't get it.

05:32.530 --> 05:35.282
He was such a good kid.
How well did you know Blake?

05:35.333 --> 05:37.167
Blake was a lot more
than just a renter.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.703
I considered him a friend.

05:39.787 --> 05:41.371
You see that cutlass?

05:41.455 --> 05:42.839
That's Royal Navy.

05:42.924 --> 05:45.292
Blake got it off an 18th
century British schooner

05:45.343 --> 05:46.793
that sank off
the Antilles.

05:46.844 --> 05:48.595
He gave it to me as a thanks

05:48.662 --> 05:50.297
for not going after him
for back rent.

05:50.348 --> 05:51.664
So Blake was a diver?

05:51.716 --> 05:53.633
Damn good one.
Best salvage diver

05:53.684 --> 05:56.169
who ever walked though my door.
Salvage diving.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.503
That's, uh,
that's dangerous work.

05:57.555 --> 05:59.022
Lucrative, too.

05:59.106 --> 06:01.107
Blake found wreck sites
all over the world.

06:01.175 --> 06:03.143
Had collectors lining
up to buy from him.

06:03.194 --> 06:05.779
So why's he living in
an apartment above a bar?

06:05.846 --> 06:07.314
He moved back to Hawaii
after his mom got sick.

06:07.365 --> 06:09.733
Had to put her in a
rest home near Waipahu.

06:09.817 --> 06:12.352
You know, that didn't keep
him out of the water though.

06:12.403 --> 06:15.905
From what I could tell he was
going after a new wreck.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.523
He tell you what it was?

06:17.575 --> 06:18.691
Nah.

06:18.743 --> 06:20.410
But if Blake was interested
in it,

06:20.494 --> 06:22.162
it had to be something big.

06:24.882 --> 06:28.418
Here you go.
Thank you.

06:28.502 --> 06:30.253
Thanks.

06:30.338 --> 06:32.589
I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

06:32.657 --> 06:33.840
Lovely place.

06:33.891 --> 06:36.092
I'll get Lori
to track down the mother.

06:36.177 --> 06:38.211
All right, what's
missing here?

06:38.262 --> 06:39.712
Oh, besides a box spring,

06:39.764 --> 06:42.649
a television, anywhere to sit,
I have no idea.

06:42.716 --> 06:46.269
Blake traveled the world
diving shipwrecks,

06:46.354 --> 06:47.604
looking for
hidden treasure.

06:47.672 --> 06:51.157
Don't you think he would have
kept something?

06:51.225 --> 06:53.026
He's got a sick mother
to support.

06:53.077 --> 06:55.495
Maybe he had to
sell everything.

06:55.562 --> 06:59.115
Or he was sinking everything
into his next treasure hunt.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.202
Guy maxed out his credit card
on boat and equipment rentals.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.671
12 grand alone last month.

07:04.738 --> 07:06.456
You know, this is
generally not the kind

07:06.540 --> 07:08.208
of reading material you find
under a mattress.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.243
Looks like codes
and stuff.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.745
I bet they're
navigational coordinates.

07:12.797 --> 07:14.047
Blake probably encoded them

07:14.098 --> 07:16.132
to protect his dive sites.

07:16.217 --> 07:17.550
A lot of trouble to go through.

07:17.601 --> 07:19.469
Must be something pretty valuable.

07:19.553 --> 07:21.688
You hear that?

07:21.755 --> 07:23.306
Huh?
Listen.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.495
You know, the treasure
Blake was looking for--

07:45.579 --> 07:48.164
looks like he already found it.

07:48.232 --> 07:50.567
Yeah, and it might
have got him killed.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.355
Excuse me,
Mrs. Spencer,

08:02.356 --> 08:04.073
I'm Officer Lori Weston.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.641
Is it okay if I come in
and talk to you?

08:05.692 --> 08:09.061
Please, come in.

08:09.129 --> 08:10.813
Can I get you
something to drink?

08:10.864 --> 08:12.865
- Or eat?
- No, thank you.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.450
I have a sandwich here.

08:14.501 --> 08:16.419
My son likes one
when he comes home.

08:16.486 --> 08:17.653
Your son?

08:17.704 --> 08:19.154
- You mean Blake?
- Yes.

08:19.206 --> 08:21.340
He should be home any minute.

08:21.425 --> 08:23.259
He's always so
hungry after school.

08:23.326 --> 08:25.628
Blake's still in school?

08:25.679 --> 08:28.431
Sixth grade now.

08:28.498 --> 08:30.750
His teachers say he's one

08:30.817 --> 08:32.835
of the smartest
in his class.

08:37.006 --> 08:38.224
Do you have children?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.775
No, ma'am. I don't.

08:39.842 --> 08:42.561
Well, you have plenty
of time for that.

08:42.645 --> 08:44.179
Did you say

08:44.231 --> 08:46.198
you wanted to talk

08:48.151 --> 08:49.952
Is something wrong, dear?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.357
<i>It's amazing.</i>

08:55.409 --> 08:58.327
I mean, one day you are

08:58.378 --> 08:59.829
The next thing you know,

08:59.880 --> 09:01.314
you' hanging from
the ceiling in a museum

09:01.381 --> 09:03.633
and children are looking

09:03.700 --> 09:05.051

09:05.135 --> 09:07.336
Yep, kind of puts

09:14.711 --> 09:15.845
Hi. Dr. Gabrielle Asano.

09:15.896 --> 09:17.096
I'm the museum's curator

09:17.180 --> 09:19.231
of historic and cultural affairs.
Nice to meet you.

09:19.316 --> 09:21.434
Nice to meet you, too.
Nice to meet you.

09:21.518 --> 09:24.053
Very nice to meet you.

09:25.689 --> 09:26.989
Danny.

09:27.057 --> 09:28.223
- Huh?
- The coins?

09:28.275 --> 09:29.892
Oh, sorry.

09:29.943 --> 09:31.444
Um...

09:31.528 --> 09:33.362
Have...

09:33.413 --> 09:34.997
you ever seen
anything like this?

09:35.065 --> 09:36.231
What's the matter?

09:38.234 --> 09:41.704
As a matter of fact... I have.

09:41.755 --> 09:45.708
The <i>Princesa Del Mar</i>
was a Spanish trade galleon

09:45.759 --> 09:47.376
lost at sea in 1682,

09:47.427 --> 09:50.079
after it came under cannon fire
from English pirates.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.681
These coins

09:51.748 --> 09:53.082
are from that wreck.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.601
Spanish galleon?
Is it possible

09:55.686 --> 09:57.920
that something like that could
have sunk in local waters?

09:57.971 --> 09:59.105
Absolutely.

09:59.189 --> 10:00.556
The galleon's believed
to have diverted here

10:00.607 --> 10:02.058
for repairs
after the pirate attack.

10:02.109 --> 10:04.143
Salvage divers have been
looking for the wreck for years.

10:04.227 --> 10:06.862
Right, so what you're saying is,
whoever recovered these coins

10:06.930 --> 10:08.430
may actually have
found the <i>Princesa?</i>

10:08.482 --> 10:09.699
Pirate ships

10:09.766 --> 10:11.934
and cannonballs
and treasure.

10:11.985 --> 10:14.570
I thought this stuff only
happened in movies.

10:14.621 --> 10:17.289
I can assure you
the treasure is very real.

10:17.374 --> 10:19.108
And very valuable.

10:19.159 --> 10:21.660
Valuable? How, uh, how much
are we talking about?

10:21.745 --> 10:24.046
On the collectible market,
the coins would fetch

10:24.114 --> 10:25.414
maybe a couple thousand...

10:25.949 --> 10:26.916
...each.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.384
And the <i>Princesa</i>

10:28.451 --> 10:30.920
was believed to be carrying
several tons of them.

10:30.971 --> 10:32.121
That's a lot of money.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.090
That's a lot of motive.

10:34.141 --> 10:36.809
Gentlemen, would you mind if
I held on to these for a while?

10:36.893 --> 10:39.261
On behalf of the museum,
I'd like to authenticate them.

10:39.312 --> 10:41.964
I'm sorry, but these coins are actually
evidence in a murder investigation.

10:42.015 --> 10:43.816
Yeah, but...

10:43.900 --> 10:46.102
I'm thinking it won't hurt to
just give her one little coin.

10:48.855 --> 10:50.806
Go ahead.
It's fine.

10:50.857 --> 10:52.825
<i>It's just one coin.</i>

10:52.909 --> 10:54.810
- Why are you losing your mind?
- I'm not losing my mind.

10:54.861 --> 10:56.562
If you want to ask her out,
ask her out.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.147
- I'm just saying.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:58.198 --> 11:00.002
Who said anything
about asking her out?

11:00.003 --> 11:01.617
Come on.
You left Dr. Asano a coin

11:01.618 --> 11:03.119
so you have a reason
to go back and see her.

11:03.170 --> 11:04.286
- It's fine.
- Uh, that's not true.

11:04.337 --> 11:05.821
I left her a coin
because she might

11:05.872 --> 11:07.173
be able to help
with our investigation.

11:07.257 --> 11:09.592
Really? You know
what you should do?

11:09.659 --> 11:11.177
You should ask her out
for coffee.

11:11.261 --> 11:13.546
I don't want... I'm not...

11:13.630 --> 11:14.964
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

11:15.015 --> 11:16.665
Coffee's not a relationship.
It's a beverage.

11:16.716 --> 11:18.184
That's not true.
Every single relationship

11:18.268 --> 11:19.652
starts with a cup of coffee.

11:19.719 --> 11:21.103
Then it's dinner
and a movie. Okay?

11:21.171 --> 11:22.671
Next thing you know, you're
divorced, you're moving

11:22.722 --> 11:24.273
to Hawaii so you can see your
daughter every other weekend.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.357
You need to talk
to somebody professionally.

11:25.442 --> 11:27.193
- Okay?
- I do. You.

11:27.277 --> 11:28.494
And now the session's over.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.146
No, the session's
not over, Danny.

11:30.197 --> 11:31.647
You need to get back
on the horse, and a cup

11:31.698 --> 11:33.616
of coffee's a good place to start.
What are we doing?

11:33.683 --> 11:34.867
Need to make a stop.
Just wait here.

11:50.366 --> 11:52.334
Hi, Cat.

11:55.088 --> 11:56.972
- Thank you for meeting me.
- Yeah.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.474
Got that for you.

11:58.541 --> 12:00.209
Oh, look at that.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.211
Thank you.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.819
What do you need
this time?

12:09.886 --> 12:11.237
What do you
make of this?

12:13.406 --> 12:15.674
<i>Our victim was a wreck diver,</i>
<i>and we think</i>

12:15.742 --> 12:18.160
that he may have been killed
at one of his dive sites.

12:18.228 --> 12:20.095
Okay, well, if you're right
about these being coordinates,

12:20.163 --> 12:21.747
then the cipher
should be easy to crack.

12:21.815 --> 12:23.582
I'll run cryptography
and let you know what I find.

12:23.667 --> 12:24.917
Mahalo.

12:28.755 --> 12:30.906
See, this is usually
the part where, you know,

12:30.957 --> 12:32.892
you ask me out
to dinner as a thank you.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.910
Oh, no... absolutely.
Anywhere you want, okay?

12:34.961 --> 12:36.228
But before you decide,

12:36.296 --> 12:40.082
I, uh... I need to ask
you one more favor.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.852
Sasabune, <i>omakase</i> menu.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.520
Yeah.

12:44.587 --> 12:45.888
Now, what's the favor?

12:45.939 --> 12:47.523
Fine.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.591
Um...

12:49.643 --> 12:51.560
you remember Joe White?

12:51.611 --> 12:52.945
Your old commander?
Yeah.

12:53.029 --> 12:54.480
Yeah, yeah. Uh, I heard
he's overseeing

12:54.564 --> 12:56.565
SEAL Team training at Pearl now.
Yeah, he is.

12:56.616 --> 12:58.567
Uh...

12:58.618 --> 13:01.270
look, he submitted a piece
of intel for analysis, okay?

13:01.321 --> 13:03.438
It's a video I'm trying
to pull sound from.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.291
DOD has been sitting
on it for weeks now.

13:05.375 --> 13:07.776
I just... I was hoping you
could check the status for me.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.611
Look, if the request
came from Joe,

13:09.663 --> 13:11.130
I'm sure it's
being handled.

13:11.214 --> 13:14.300
Could you just check
for me, please?

13:15.785 --> 13:18.053
Do you think someone at DOD
is giving you the runaround?

13:18.121 --> 13:20.923
I don't know. I don't
know what's going on.

13:21.958 --> 13:23.458
Yeah. Okay.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.460
<i>Good timing.</i>

13:25.512 --> 13:27.229
The Coast Guard
just recovered the rest

13:27.297 --> 13:28.764
of Blake Spencer's body
at sea.

13:28.815 --> 13:31.133
Max found traces of helium
in the lung tissue.

13:31.184 --> 13:34.253
So we know Blake was killed
right after a mixed gas dive,

13:34.321 --> 13:35.321
which means deep water.
Exactly.

13:35.405 --> 13:36.605
And check this out.

13:36.656 --> 13:38.741
He still had
his dive bag on him.

13:38.808 --> 13:40.642
What is that?
There's something in there.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.962
I had everything sent
to the crime lab for analysis.

13:43.029 --> 13:44.413
I'm heading over there now.
Hopefully, whatever's

13:44.480 --> 13:46.081
inside that bag
could lead us to our killer.

13:46.149 --> 13:47.266
Good. Hey.

13:47.334 --> 13:49.118
Did you get anything
from the mother?

13:49.169 --> 13:50.336
Not exactly.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.288
How'd she take it?

13:52.339 --> 13:53.923
I didn't tell her.
What? What are you talking about?

13:53.990 --> 13:55.991
- Why not?
- The woman's suffering from Alzheimer's.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.293
She thinks Blake's
11 years old.

13:57.344 --> 14:00.012
There's no way she'd
be able to process it.

14:00.096 --> 14:01.931
Uh, how'd the
museum work out?

14:01.998 --> 14:04.183
How'd it go, Danny?
How was the museum?

14:04.267 --> 14:05.500
Enough, okay?

14:05.552 --> 14:07.002
Turns out that our victim
uncovered a major shipwreck.

14:07.053 --> 14:09.271
So we're thinking that somebody
got hip to what he was doing,

14:09.339 --> 14:11.006
followed him out to the site
and killed him.

14:11.057 --> 14:13.692
We need to find out who else
knew about that treasure.

14:15.026 --> 14:16.050
An old wallet?

14:16.075 --> 14:17.675
It's the only thing I
found in the dive bag.

14:18.014 --> 14:21.850
And last I checked,
17th century pirates

14:21.901 --> 14:24.370
didn't carry leather wallets
made in New York City.

14:24.454 --> 14:26.622
Right. So it
belonged to Blake?

14:26.689 --> 14:27.689
I don't think so.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.041
But based on
the oxidation,

14:29.125 --> 14:30.376
I'd say this thing
was submerged

14:30.460 --> 14:31.961
for at least 50 years.

14:32.028 --> 14:34.213
I may be able to date
it more accurately

14:34.297 --> 14:36.081
once I'm done
processing these.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.300
Wow, there was
money inside it.

14:38.368 --> 14:40.386
The wallet prevented the bills
from deteriorating completely,

14:40.470 --> 14:41.837
but the ink is mostly gone.

14:41.888 --> 14:44.539
Either way, he didn't get
this off the <i>Princesa.</i>

14:44.591 --> 14:45.924
All right, so he could
have been diving

14:46.009 --> 14:47.176
another wreck
when he was killed.

14:47.227 --> 14:49.561
I'll let you know when
I'm done processing.

14:49.646 --> 14:51.347
Yeah, thanks, Charlie.

14:51.398 --> 14:52.714
Hey.

14:54.384 --> 14:56.402
Um, I need a favor.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.355
This is my
activity log

14:59.406 --> 15:01.323
for the HPD database.

15:01.391 --> 15:02.891
The login that's
circled here

15:02.942 --> 15:05.361
was made from an IP address
that I don't recognize.

15:05.412 --> 15:07.363
Now, I managed
to back-trace it

15:07.414 --> 15:10.499
through a couple of proxies,
but I can't get past a VPN.

15:10.566 --> 15:11.900
Can you help?

15:13.236 --> 15:15.454
Chin, if someone hacked
into your account,

15:15.538 --> 15:16.922
you need to notify
the department.

15:17.007 --> 15:20.376
I will-- if the threat's legit.

15:21.411 --> 15:23.712
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

15:23.763 --> 15:25.264
Thanks.

15:30.970 --> 15:32.488
Thanks for the beer.

15:32.555 --> 15:34.106
Mm-hmm.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.041
Thanks for nothing.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.893
Can I buy you a drink?

15:37.944 --> 15:40.863
Seen you making the rounds.
You a cop?

15:40.930 --> 15:42.431
Mm-hmm. Lori Weston, Five-O.

15:42.482 --> 15:43.615
Jimmy Koller.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.617
Nice to meet you,
Jimmy Koller.

15:45.702 --> 15:47.453
Well, that's an
interesting ring.

15:47.537 --> 15:49.705
What is that, white
gold or something?

15:49.772 --> 15:50.873
Oxidized silver.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.458
Got it off the HMS <i>Pegasus.</i>

15:52.542 --> 15:55.627
Right. Thought you
might be a diver.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.629
You... by any chance,
you know a Blake Spencer?

15:57.714 --> 15:58.964
As well
as the next guy.

15:59.049 --> 16:01.283
Blake mostly kept to himself,
but I heard he was a real pro.

16:01.334 --> 16:02.885
Hmm.

16:02.952 --> 16:05.471
You hear anything about him
diving the <i>Princesa Del Mar?</i>

16:05.555 --> 16:07.122
No.

16:07.173 --> 16:09.675
But I know a guy who's been
hunting the <i>Princesa</i> for years.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.677
Sunk a lot of money
into finding her, too.

16:12.729 --> 16:15.797
And who might that be?

16:15.849 --> 16:15.931
I'm Jesse Billings,
president of Voyager Marine,

16:19.018 --> 16:22.304
the world leader in deep water
shipwreck exploration.

16:22.355 --> 16:25.607
Today, I'm going to offer you
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

16:25.658 --> 16:27.242
to invest in what just may be

16:27.310 --> 16:29.912
the greatest treasure hunt
of all time.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.780
For the past
two years,

16:31.831 --> 16:33.031
Billings has been
pitching investors

16:33.116 --> 16:34.316
on the hunt for the <i>Princesa.</i>

16:34.367 --> 16:36.618
He's already sold
millions in shares.

16:36.669 --> 16:38.454
Which means he had a lot to lose
if someone found

16:38.505 --> 16:40.956
the wreck before he did.

16:41.007 --> 16:42.424
At Voyager Marine,
This is Detective Williams.

16:42.492 --> 16:43.658
our world-class team
of researchers,

16:43.710 --> 16:45.511
<i>technicians and divers</i>

16:45.595 --> 16:48.130
<i>search the oceans for treasures</i>

16:48.181 --> 16:49.948
once thought lost forever.

16:50.016 --> 16:52.167
Here's what I don't get--
with all the resources

16:52.218 --> 16:53.685
that Jesse had,
how was Blake able

16:53.770 --> 16:55.187
to beat him to
the <i>Princesa?</i>

16:56.606 --> 16:57.940
That's how.

16:58.007 --> 17:00.008
That's our dead diver.

17:00.059 --> 17:01.643
Blake worked
for Jesse Billings.

17:01.694 --> 17:03.061
So he didn't discover
the <i>Princesa;</i>

17:03.146 --> 17:04.780
he stole the coins
from his boss.

17:04.847 --> 17:06.815
Yeah, and you know what?
I bet Jesse was pretty upset

17:06.866 --> 17:08.650
- when he found out about it.
- Thank you.

17:08.718 --> 17:09.984
Um, only one problem
with that theory.

17:10.036 --> 17:11.286
Just got off the phone

17:11.354 --> 17:13.122
with Dr. Asano
from the Bishop Museum.

17:13.189 --> 17:15.574
The coins we found
in Blake's apartment are fake.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.175
- You think I killed Blake Spencer.
- He's a mind reader.

17:30.176 --> 17:31.927
Yes, that's what we think.

17:31.994 --> 17:33.995
Why would I kill
my best diver?

17:34.046 --> 17:35.847
I'll tell you why--
because Blake found out

17:35.932 --> 17:38.300
that the treasure hunt
you hired him for was a scam.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.337
Why don't you take
a look at this photo?

17:45.892 --> 17:47.025
Where did you get these?

17:47.110 --> 17:48.343
We found those
in Blake's apartment.

17:50.596 --> 17:52.998
Those coins are about
as real as your tan.

17:53.065 --> 17:55.283
You know what? I bet you
haven't even dipped a toe

17:55.351 --> 17:56.684
in the water in years.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.686
But I have to commend you

17:58.738 --> 18:00.355
on a somewhat elaborate scam.

18:00.406 --> 18:03.158
It's pretty good-- you dump a
bunch of fake coins in the ocean

18:03.209 --> 18:05.710
to convince your investors
that you have found

18:05.795 --> 18:07.496
the <i>Princesa Del Mar.</i>

18:07.547 --> 18:09.247
But you didn't find
the <i>Princesa,</i> did you?

18:09.332 --> 18:10.882
And Blake realized
the coins were fakes,

18:10.967 --> 18:12.300
and that's why he took them.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.136
And you knew he was going
to open his mouth

18:14.203 --> 18:15.870
about it,
so you had to kill him.

18:17.390 --> 18:20.208
I've, uh...

18:20.259 --> 18:22.644
I've salted a few shipwrecks--

18:22.711 --> 18:25.347
I admit that--
but I had no idea

18:25.398 --> 18:27.048
Blake knew it.

18:27.099 --> 18:28.883
I swear.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.388
- Got some news on those bills.
- Great.

18:37.109 --> 18:38.577
What is it?

18:41.897 --> 18:43.882
I traced that IP address
you gave me.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.067
That login was made
from a home computer.

18:46.118 --> 18:48.170
- Okay. Do we know the owner?
- Yeah.

18:48.237 --> 18:49.754
It was Kono.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.757
Kono was dismissed
from the force.

18:52.842 --> 18:55.010
What's she doing
using your password

18:55.077 --> 18:56.344
to access
HPD files?

18:56.412 --> 18:57.879
You know what?

18:57.930 --> 18:59.247
That was me.

18:59.298 --> 19:01.749
I was at Kono's house
that day.

19:01.801 --> 19:04.752
I used her computer to check up
on some case work.

19:06.355 --> 19:07.606
- Thanks.
- Right.

19:07.690 --> 19:08.923
So what do we know
about those bills?

19:08.975 --> 19:10.592
Took some work,
but I was able

19:10.643 --> 19:12.277
to piece together
one of them.

19:12.345 --> 19:14.279
- What is that, a five?
- Good eye.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.815
It's pretty faded, but
there's still some ink there.

19:16.899 --> 19:19.067
And wait till
you see this.

19:23.706 --> 19:27.192
The Hawaiian overprint note,
issued in 1942.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.160
After Pearl Harbor,
the decision was made

19:29.228 --> 19:31.763
to pull all the paper money
on the Islands and destroy it,

19:31.831 --> 19:33.781
replacing it with this.
Why?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.417
Because, had the Japanese
invaded Hawaii, they would have

19:35.468 --> 19:37.135
been able to seize huge sums
of U.S. currency.

19:37.220 --> 19:38.620
But this way, the
Federal Reserve

19:38.671 --> 19:41.473
just declares the Hawaii-stamped
bills worthless. Problem solved.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.141
Of course, the invasion
never happened.

19:43.226 --> 19:45.594
When the war ended, the
overprint notes were recalled.

19:45.645 --> 19:47.479
Okay. How did Blake get this?

19:47.563 --> 19:48.630
Not from the <i>Princesa.</i>

19:48.681 --> 19:50.265
He must have been diving
another wreck.

19:50.316 --> 19:52.317
If that wallet
was underwater for 50 years,

19:52.401 --> 19:54.603
he may have been salvaging a ship
that sunk during World War II.

19:54.654 --> 19:57.606
Okay, hang on a second.
Catherine decrypted

19:57.657 --> 20:00.225
the coordinates from
Blake's notebook.

20:00.293 --> 20:03.078
Look where they fall.
It's a straight line from Oahu to Maui.

20:03.145 --> 20:04.312
His wreck must
have sunk

20:04.363 --> 20:05.747
along a ferry
or shipping route.

20:05.814 --> 20:07.165
That's a lot of ground to cover.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.000
And Blake could have been killed
at any one of these sites.

20:09.085 --> 20:10.835
I may know
how to find which one.

20:15.408 --> 20:17.342
<i>According to Blake's</i>

20:17.410 --> 20:19.794
credit card company, he rented
one of your salvage boats.

20:19.845 --> 20:21.496
Yeah. Most of
my business

20:21.547 --> 20:22.747
is wreck divers.

20:22.815 --> 20:24.999
Blake wasn't due back
until tomorrow.

20:25.051 --> 20:27.335
Did he say where he planned on diving?
I didn't ask,

20:27.386 --> 20:28.970
and he wouldn't
have told me if I had.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.689
Blake didn't talk
to anybody about his work.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.941
Okay, Mr. Julian, that boat
is now a crime scene,

20:33.008 --> 20:35.026
so you think you can help us
find where it is?

20:35.111 --> 20:37.445
All my rentals are equipped
with tracking systems.

20:37.513 --> 20:39.180
Just a second.
I'll pull it up.

20:39.231 --> 20:40.482
Okay, perfect.
Great.

20:43.286 --> 20:45.353
Is there a problem?

20:45.404 --> 20:47.674
The transponder on his boat
isn't working. Must be busted.

20:47.675 --> 20:49.451
Or Blake disabled it
because he didn't want

20:49.492 --> 20:51.859
anyone following him to his dive site.
Okay, listen to me.

20:51.911 --> 20:53.795
Give me the tags
and a description of the boat.

20:53.862 --> 20:55.413
Okay, if Blake's killers
haven't sunk the boat,

20:55.498 --> 20:57.365
it's got to still be out there
somewhere, right?

20:57.416 --> 21:00.168
<i>6588, Sector Honolulu.</i>

21:00.219 --> 21:01.670
<i>Request op and position.</i>

21:01.721 --> 21:04.005
<i>Sector Honolulu, 6588,</i>

21:04.056 --> 21:07.225
operations normal, position
21 degrees, 45.3 minutes north,

21:07.310 --> 21:10.679
<i>157 degrees, 25.4 minutes west,</i>

21:10.730 --> 21:13.348
one plus one zero minutes
to bingo.

21:13.399 --> 21:16.067
<i>Continuing parallel search</i>
<i>for the overdue vessel.</i>

21:16.152 --> 21:18.353
<i>So let me ask you a question.</i>

21:18.404 --> 21:20.388
If a woman leaves
the relationship status

21:20.456 --> 21:23.041
on her profile page empty,
does that generally mean

21:23.109 --> 21:25.310
that she is single
or that she is taken?

21:25.378 --> 21:28.079
Is this about the hot
doctor from the museum?

21:28.164 --> 21:30.415
I mean, you should
ask her out.

21:30.483 --> 21:32.467
What, he... he talked
to you about this?

21:32.535 --> 21:34.052
What, are we
in high school?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.070
- No, we're not, but...
- Hey, guys.

21:36.122 --> 21:37.305
Coast Guard just called.

21:37.373 --> 21:39.290
They found Blake's boat
40 miles east of Oahu.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.226
Pilot says it is not moving
with the currents.

21:41.293 --> 21:42.877
Ooh!
Even I know what that means.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.030
- Means the boat is anchored.
- That's right.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.765
So the site Blake was diving
must be right below it.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.133
Yeah, there's only one way
to find out.

21:48.217 --> 21:49.367
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Those are deep waters.

21:49.435 --> 21:51.302
You'd be crazy
to dive that by yourself.

21:51.387 --> 21:53.254
Yeah, I would.
That's why I'm taking a partner.

21:53.305 --> 21:55.190
Partner?

21:58.778 --> 22:02.213
Steve, glad you called.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.962
Chin, it's not
a good time.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.798
I want to know why
you were using

22:19.865 --> 22:21.466
my password to access
HPD records.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.421
I wanted to see
my case file.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.740
Why?

22:28.808 --> 22:30.759
'Cause I want to know
what they have on me.

22:30.810 --> 22:33.127
See if there's any chance of me
ever getting my badge back.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.446
You could have just asked me.

22:34.513 --> 22:35.963
You just got reinstated
a month ago.

22:36.015 --> 22:38.132
Last thing I want to do
is cause you any trouble.

22:38.184 --> 22:40.635
You shouldn't
even be here.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.643
What the hell
is he doing here?

22:48.694 --> 22:50.829
Lieutenant Kelly.

22:50.913 --> 22:54.649
It's nice to see you
got your badge back.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.837
Yeah, some of us,
we weren't so lucky.

22:58.921 --> 23:00.622
You got ten seconds
to turn around

23:00.673 --> 23:04.292
and go back to your car, Ray.

23:04.343 --> 23:05.877
You want me to leave, Kono?

23:05.961 --> 23:07.429
No.

23:15.471 --> 23:17.689
Bye-bye.

23:24.947 --> 23:27.682
Good ol' cousin Chin.

23:27.733 --> 23:30.785
He's back with
Five-O, that right?

23:30.853 --> 23:33.872
Yeah.

23:33.956 --> 23:37.909
And, uh, you used his password
to get me those HPD files?

23:41.664 --> 23:45.250
I can't decide whether that
was really resourceful...

23:45.334 --> 23:47.802
or incredibly stupid.

23:49.889 --> 23:51.038
Look, Frank,

23:51.090 --> 23:53.591
you came to me for access,
I got you access.

23:53.676 --> 23:55.093
Chin won't be a problem.

23:55.177 --> 23:56.594
I'll make sure of it.

23:56.679 --> 23:57.762
You better.

23:57.847 --> 24:00.064
Your cousin starts
poking his nose

24:00.149 --> 24:01.382
where it doesn't belong,

24:01.433 --> 24:03.685
that's gonna be a problem
for all of us.

24:03.736 --> 24:08.273
I might not handle it
as delicately as you.

24:16.916 --> 24:18.700
We got blood.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.705
Gunshot spatter and a pool here
where Blake must have dropped.

24:23.756 --> 24:26.257
Why right here?

24:26.342 --> 24:28.593
Could have set up
while Blake was diving,

24:28.677 --> 24:31.062
and popped him right when
he got out of the water.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.514
Got a slug here. Nine mil.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.303
All right,
check out this trajectory.

24:38.387 --> 24:40.638
Shooter had to be on the boat
for this to line up.

24:40.723 --> 24:43.641
Which means he either forced
his way on or...

24:43.726 --> 24:46.945
Or Blake trusted him enough
to have him on board.

24:53.402 --> 24:55.119
So, uh, you hear

24:55.204 --> 24:59.106
anything back from the DOD about
that surveillance video yet?

24:59.158 --> 25:00.825
Still no word.

25:02.745 --> 25:04.078
What?

25:04.129 --> 25:05.997
I just can't shake this feeling

25:06.081 --> 25:07.749
there's something you're not
telling me, Joe.

25:07.800 --> 25:11.336
Well try harder
'cause when we break 150 feet

25:11.420 --> 25:13.221
and the narcosis sets in,
you're gonna have

25:13.288 --> 25:15.340
enough trouble keeping your head
straight without those thoughts

25:15.424 --> 25:16.841
bouncing around in it.
Understand?

25:16.926 --> 25:19.427
Yeah.
Okay. I splash first.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.229
We're gonna follow
the anchor line down.

25:21.296 --> 25:23.348
Stay close, stay focused.

25:23.432 --> 25:26.901
- Now let's go see what Blake found.
- Yes. sir.

25:55.598 --> 25:57.265
♪ ♪

26:25.360 --> 26:27.211
♪ ♪

26:46.293 --> 26:47.885
Max, you need a hand?

26:47.886 --> 26:48.970
Oh, thank you,

26:49.021 --> 26:50.555
but it is against
protocol

26:50.639 --> 26:52.223
for anyone but the ME
to handle the remains.

26:52.307 --> 26:54.776
No, no, I don't want to help.
There's actually a hand

26:54.843 --> 26:56.778
right there if you want,
if you need a hand.

26:56.845 --> 26:57.929
Ah, that was very humorous.

26:57.996 --> 26:59.614
Hey, guys, so the car
is a late 1930's

26:59.681 --> 27:01.783
Packard model ambulance,
military issue.

27:01.850 --> 27:04.185
So, this guy
could have been a soldier?

27:04.236 --> 27:05.269
I don't know. Max?

27:05.337 --> 27:06.687
Well, I can't answer that.

27:06.739 --> 27:10.792
But I can tell you that we have
a full skeleton here.

27:10.859 --> 27:13.294
It's male,
roughly six feet tall.

27:13.361 --> 27:15.713
As for the COD, well,
it wasn't anything nefarious.

27:15.781 --> 27:17.248
Just a few broken bones.

27:17.332 --> 27:18.866
Any chance we can get
an ID on him?

27:18.917 --> 27:22.670
Teeth are intact, however,
if he is as old as the car

27:22.721 --> 27:24.255
that we found him in,
then most likely

27:24.339 --> 27:26.808
we don't have dental records
that go that far back.

27:26.875 --> 27:28.025
So ID'ing him would
be a long shot.

27:28.093 --> 27:30.044
We could always take him
to JPAC.

27:30.095 --> 27:31.646
They got X-rays and records

27:31.713 --> 27:33.314
going all the way back
to the '30s.

27:33.381 --> 27:35.349
So if this guy served,
he's probably in the system.

27:35.417 --> 27:37.351
Let's hope so.
Blake died salvaging this car.

27:37.419 --> 27:39.854
We need to find out
why it was worth killing for.

27:39.905 --> 27:43.274
Okay. Bag him up, kid.
You're going with.

27:43.358 --> 27:45.176
Yes!

28:15.107 --> 28:16.474
Did you know that JPAC

28:16.558 --> 28:18.509
is the largest forensic
lab in the world,

28:18.577 --> 28:20.945
and that it specializes
exclusively

28:21.029 --> 28:22.480
in postmortem
identification?

28:22.548 --> 28:23.597
Which, incidentally,

28:23.649 --> 28:25.850
is my favorite type
of identification.

28:31.106 --> 28:33.574
You need a paper bag
or something?

28:33.625 --> 28:34.826
Huh? Oh, sorry.

28:34.910 --> 28:37.245
It's just this place
is like my Graceland.

28:37.296 --> 28:39.080
Okay.

28:40.082 --> 28:41.132
But no souvenirs.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.250
Gentlemen.

28:42.301 --> 28:43.568
Hi, I'm Dr. Tallridge.

28:43.635 --> 28:45.169
Scientific Director.
Joe White.

28:45.254 --> 28:46.453
Max Bergman.

28:46.505 --> 28:48.339
Max, welcome to JPAC.

28:48.423 --> 28:50.374
Um, why don't we find
a lab table

28:50.442 --> 28:52.593
and see what you got here.

28:53.962 --> 28:55.930
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I researched archives</i>

28:55.981 --> 28:58.416
for the <i>Advertiser</i>
and <i>The Maui News.</i>

28:58.484 --> 28:59.851
Went all the way
back to 1938.

28:59.935 --> 29:01.018
No articles
mentioning anything

29:01.103 --> 29:02.904
about a car
lost at sea.

29:02.971 --> 29:04.989
I found something with Naval
History and Heritage Command.

29:05.073 --> 29:06.524
These guys, they keep records

29:06.608 --> 29:07.909
of every incident report
ever filed.

29:07.976 --> 29:09.911
This was dated

29:09.978 --> 29:11.245
July 19, 1942.

29:11.313 --> 29:13.314
A Navy transport vessel
was delivering supplies

29:13.365 --> 29:16.033
to Maui when a big storm hit,

29:16.118 --> 29:18.119
sending some of the cargo
overboard.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.204
Including a 1939 Army ambulance.

29:20.289 --> 29:22.089
You found it.

29:22.157 --> 29:23.674
I did find it,
but it doesn't explain why

29:23.759 --> 29:26.093
Blake was salvaging that car.
I don't get it.

29:26.161 --> 29:27.378
Maybe there's something
valuable inside.

29:27.462 --> 29:29.463
No, I mean, according
to this report,

29:29.515 --> 29:32.433
the ambulance was transporting
a body for burial.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.603
The deceased was a
Captain Robert S. Murphy.

29:35.670 --> 29:37.722
You think those were
his remains inside?

29:37.806 --> 29:40.841
I don't know. I mean, there were
bones in the front seat.

29:40.893 --> 29:42.393
There was no casket
in the back.

29:42.477 --> 29:43.861
Wait a minute.

29:44.813 --> 29:46.447
I've seen this guy before.

29:46.514 --> 29:49.066
I was just a little girl
when my father died.

29:49.151 --> 29:52.853
We were living in Maui,
he was stationed at Pearl.

29:52.905 --> 29:54.322
After the attack,

29:54.373 --> 29:59.577
it took a few days until we
heard that he'd been killed.

29:59.661 --> 30:01.662
Dad was supposed
to have been buried

30:01.713 --> 30:03.915
in the family plot, but...

30:03.999 --> 30:05.699
But he never made it home.

30:05.751 --> 30:11.339
Not knowing where he was,
it always haunted my mother.

30:11.390 --> 30:13.007
Haunted the rest of us, too.

30:15.093 --> 30:18.596
Mrs. Spencer,
I'm... I'm so very sorry.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.214
No family

30:20.282 --> 30:23.017
should ever have to suffer
through something like that.

30:24.036 --> 30:26.370
You've served,
haven't you?

30:26.438 --> 30:27.822
Yes, ma'am, Navy.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.241
I can tell.

30:30.325 --> 30:31.993
You have that
look about you.

30:32.060 --> 30:36.364
My son Blake wants to be
a sailor when he grows up.

30:36.415 --> 30:39.850
I can't keep that boy
out of the water.

30:44.456 --> 30:45.673
Mrs. Spencer...

30:47.926 --> 30:49.343
...about Blake...

30:49.411 --> 30:51.128
Mrs. Spencer,
thank you.

30:51.213 --> 30:53.848
We'll, uh, we'll be
on our way.

30:53.915 --> 30:55.549
<i>But she still doesn't know</i>
<i>about Blake.</i>

30:55.601 --> 30:58.603
Better to tell her
when we have answers.

30:58.687 --> 30:59.854
He was looking for
his grandfather.

30:59.921 --> 31:00.972
That's why finding
that ambulance

31:01.056 --> 31:02.023
was so important
to him.

31:02.090 --> 31:03.524
He wanted to give
his mother some closure

31:03.591 --> 31:04.809
by finally bringing home
the body.

31:04.893 --> 31:06.510
Yeah, I understand why it
was important to Blake,

31:06.578 --> 31:08.145
but why would somebody
kill him for it?

31:08.230 --> 31:10.264
Joe, go ahead.
Steve, we got a match on those remains.

31:10.315 --> 31:12.249
All right, did it come back
to a Captain Robert Murphy?

31:12.317 --> 31:13.401
No.

31:13.452 --> 31:14.601
Docs ID'd our man

31:14.653 --> 31:16.937
as Private Miles Brodic.

31:16.989 --> 31:19.106
He served with the 27th Infantry
out of Schofield.

31:19.157 --> 31:21.742
Beyond that, I can't tell you
much about him because his file

31:21.793 --> 31:24.211
has been classified
for nearly 70 years.

31:24.279 --> 31:25.212
Well,

31:25.280 --> 31:26.497
let's get it
declassified.

31:26.581 --> 31:29.250
A few months into
his enlistment,

31:29.301 --> 31:31.285
Private Miles Brodic faced
a court-martial

31:31.336 --> 31:34.388
on multiple charges
of petty theft.

31:34.456 --> 31:37.091
He was dishonorably
discharged in May of '41.

31:37.142 --> 31:38.342
After his discharge,

31:38.427 --> 31:40.461
Brodic took a job
at Kealani Cemetery.

31:40.512 --> 31:43.230
He was there when the
bombs dropped on Pearl.

31:43.298 --> 31:44.682
He was also there when
the government issued

31:44.766 --> 31:46.851
the order to recall
all the paper money

31:46.935 --> 31:48.352
on the islands
and replace it

31:48.437 --> 31:50.137
with the Hawaiian
overprint note.

31:50.188 --> 31:52.273
Sorry, I don't understand.

31:52.324 --> 31:53.691
Lori, Kealani Cemetery

31:53.775 --> 31:55.609
is where all the recalled money
was sent to be destroyed.

31:55.661 --> 31:57.311
They burned
over a hundred million dollars

31:57.362 --> 31:58.863
of it at the crematorium there.

31:58.947 --> 32:00.781
Actually, not all the
money was destroyed.

32:00.832 --> 32:02.249
According to
the military,

32:02.317 --> 32:05.319
$2 million was siphoned off
by someone with inside access.

32:05.370 --> 32:06.820
Brodic.

32:06.872 --> 32:10.624
By the time the MPs got wind
of it, Brodic was long gone.

32:10.676 --> 32:13.494
Anybody want to guess how he
snuck the loot off the island?

32:13.545 --> 32:16.213
Robert Murphy's casket.

32:16.298 --> 32:18.432
Brodic knew it was going
to Maui, so he stashed

32:18.500 --> 32:20.217
- his money inside of it.
- Explains why somebody

32:20.302 --> 32:21.268
would shoot Blake over it.

32:21.336 --> 32:22.269
That money is still
valid currency.

32:22.337 --> 32:23.471
So we find that casket,

32:23.522 --> 32:24.605
we find our killer.

32:24.672 --> 32:26.223
Anybody want
some shrimp mochi

32:26.291 --> 32:27.341
for dessert?

32:30.562 --> 32:33.233
That's, uh, shrimp-
flavored ice cream?

32:33.258 --> 32:34.181
Mm-hmm.

32:34.182 --> 32:36.951
Huh, that's, that's interesting.
I'm full.

32:37.018 --> 32:38.202
Yeah, I'm good, too,
but thank you.

32:38.286 --> 32:39.353
Shoots.

32:39.404 --> 32:40.521
I'll just leave the bill.

32:43.175 --> 32:45.076
I'll settle up with the big man.

32:45.143 --> 32:46.410
Thanks, Joe.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.012
You guys are gonna
want to see this.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.346
You remember
Remo Julian?

32:49.414 --> 32:50.831
Yeah.

32:50.882 --> 32:52.967
Isn't that the charter operator
that Blake rented his boat from?

32:53.034 --> 32:55.202
Mm. He's also
a very accomplished liar.

32:55.253 --> 32:57.505
Crime lab just finished
processing the boat.

32:57.556 --> 32:59.673
They found the transponder
intact and fully functional.

32:59.725 --> 33:02.059
Okay, so Remo was playing
with us

33:02.144 --> 33:03.894
when he said it
was malfunctioning.

33:03.979 --> 33:05.146
Mm-hmm. It gets better.

33:05.213 --> 33:07.064
I hacked into his system,

33:07.149 --> 33:08.715
pulled the navigational
logs for his entire fleet.

33:08.767 --> 33:11.852
Turns out there were two boats
at Blake's dive sites

33:11.903 --> 33:13.521
the night that
he was killed.

33:13.572 --> 33:15.239
Remo tracked Blake out there.

33:18.226 --> 33:19.360
<i>Remo Julian!</i>

33:19.411 --> 33:20.745
Five-O!

33:27.953 --> 33:28.686
Clear.

33:28.754 --> 33:30.204
Clear.

33:30.255 --> 33:32.039
I checked the rest of the floor.

33:32.090 --> 33:34.041
Remo's gone.

33:34.092 --> 33:35.526
Steve!

33:35.594 --> 33:36.877
Danny?

33:40.632 --> 33:42.249
I think I found Captain Murphy,

33:42.300 --> 33:44.751
our vic's grandfather.

33:44.803 --> 33:48.689
Remo took the money and tossed
the bones aside like trash.

33:48.756 --> 33:51.025
Looks like he left
in a hurry, too.

33:51.092 --> 33:54.028
All right, so that's how
he dried the cash, right?

33:54.095 --> 33:55.813
Guys, I got fresh blood
on this bill.

33:55.897 --> 33:57.114
This could mean we have
another victim.

33:57.199 --> 33:59.400
Take a look
at this coffin.

33:59.451 --> 34:01.452
Looks like it could have
been in our sunken ambulance.

34:07.459 --> 34:09.243
Doesn't look like Remo Julian

34:09.293 --> 34:11.629
will be giving us any answers.

34:19.565 --> 34:21.813
Looks like COD
was blunt-force trauma

34:21.813 --> 34:22.885
to the head.

34:22.886 --> 34:25.304
Victim also shows signs
of defensive wounds

34:25.371 --> 34:27.755
on his arms and his neck.

34:27.841 --> 34:29.842
Hmm. That's peculiar.

34:29.893 --> 34:30.842
What'd you got?

34:30.893 --> 34:32.143
Subdermal bruising.

34:32.210 --> 34:35.647
Looks like the fatal blow
left an indentation

34:35.715 --> 34:37.683
on the victim's skull.

34:39.853 --> 34:41.652
Oh.

34:41.721 --> 34:45.407
And it looks like our killer
wears a very unique ring.

34:45.492 --> 34:47.391
Take a look at this.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.862
That's the crest
of the HMS <i>Pegasus.</i>

34:51.898 --> 34:52.864
How did you know that?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.699
Because I met Remo's killer.

34:54.751 --> 34:56.668
Jimmy Koller.

34:56.735 --> 34:58.403
That's an interesting
ring. What is that?

35:27.117 --> 35:28.283
Move in.

35:59.649 --> 36:01.316
Okay, listen,
there's a tiny, tiny chance

36:01.401 --> 36:03.769
that you're going to get out
before your 90th birthday.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.687
But that window
of opportunity

36:05.772 --> 36:07.472
is closing rapidly,
you understand?

36:10.326 --> 36:11.810
Okay, window's closed. Thanks.

36:11.861 --> 36:13.946
Wait.

36:15.165 --> 36:16.949
Blake radioed Remo
from the wreck site.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.317
Said he needed a winch
and a couple guys

36:19.369 --> 36:20.752
to help dredge something up.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.788
Right, 'cause
not often you find

36:22.839 --> 36:24.423
a casket at the bottom
of the ocean.

36:24.490 --> 36:26.041
Especially one
with $2 million in it.

36:26.125 --> 36:29.378
All right, so how long before
you and Remo turned on Blake?

36:29.462 --> 36:31.096
Hey, Remo and I were willing
to split the money

36:31.163 --> 36:32.714
three ways, but Blake
gave us some line

36:32.799 --> 36:34.633
that the bones belonged
to his grandfather.

36:34.684 --> 36:36.802
He was just trying
to cut us out.

36:36.853 --> 36:38.503
So you killed him.

36:38.555 --> 36:39.805
Then you killed Remo

36:39.856 --> 36:42.173
so you could take
the whole $2 million

36:42.225 --> 36:44.009
to yourself, right?

36:44.060 --> 36:45.143
No honor among thieves.

36:45.195 --> 36:46.778
Blake wasn't lying.

36:46.846 --> 36:48.447
He didn't care
about the money.

36:48.514 --> 36:51.066
And that really was
his grandfather.

36:51.150 --> 36:52.851
He just wanted
to bury the man,

36:52.902 --> 36:55.237
put the past behind him.

36:55.305 --> 36:57.823
<i>Family plot's</i> <i>still in Maui.</i>

36:57.874 --> 37:00.542
VA's making arrangements to send
the remains there for burial.

37:00.627 --> 37:02.211
All right. Did you
notify the family?

37:02.295 --> 37:04.580
Not yet. I wanted Sylvia
to hear it from me.

37:04.664 --> 37:06.632
You going to tell her
about Blake, too?

37:06.699 --> 37:08.333
She needs to understand
her son didn't die for nothing.

37:08.384 --> 37:09.534
Because of what he did,

37:09.586 --> 37:10.869
her father can finally
be laid to rest.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.721
Small consolation, I know.

37:12.805 --> 37:15.591
It's times like these, all the
little things help, don't they?

37:15.675 --> 37:16.925
Yeah.

37:17.010 --> 37:19.428
Listen, Lori, I can make the
notification if you want.

37:19.512 --> 37:20.596
Hey, thanks. No.

37:20.663 --> 37:22.481
I need to do this on my own.

37:22.548 --> 37:24.215
It's not the first time

37:24.267 --> 37:27.019
I've had to tell a parent
they lost a child. I just...

37:27.070 --> 37:29.888
hoped I'd never have
to do it again.

37:34.410 --> 37:36.078
Who's that?

37:37.914 --> 37:39.898
That is an old friend.

37:39.949 --> 37:41.500
Excuse me a second.

37:41.567 --> 37:43.585
Okay.

37:48.791 --> 37:50.509
Hey.

37:50.576 --> 37:52.678
Hey.

37:52.745 --> 37:55.130
Uh, dinner's not
until 8:00, and you...

37:55.214 --> 37:57.248
I think
you may be a little overdressed.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.800
Hmm.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.803
Actually, I'm going to need
to ask for a rain check.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.421
Okay.

38:03.473 --> 38:05.223
Orders came in today,

38:05.275 --> 38:07.425
and I'm being sent T.A.D.
to NAVCENT.

38:08.594 --> 38:09.861
My flight for the Gulf
leaves tonight.

38:09.929 --> 38:11.029
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

38:11.097 --> 38:13.098
Wow.

38:13.149 --> 38:14.700
Yeah.

38:14.767 --> 38:16.818
So...

38:16.903 --> 38:19.154
Yeah.

38:19.238 --> 38:22.157
Anyway, um,

38:22.241 --> 38:23.575
before I left, I just wanted

38:23.626 --> 38:25.443
to get back to you
about that thing

38:25.495 --> 38:26.578
that you asked me about.

38:26.629 --> 38:28.046
Yeah.
I checked with the DOD,

38:28.114 --> 38:30.415
and they said that they haven't
received any intel requests

38:30.466 --> 38:31.616
from Commander White.

38:32.635 --> 38:34.553
You sure about that?

38:34.620 --> 38:36.922
Yeah.

38:36.973 --> 38:38.807
I'm so sorry.

38:38.891 --> 38:40.625
Yeah.

38:41.644 --> 38:43.762
I should probably go pack.

38:43.813 --> 38:45.981
Yeah, listen,
um, Catherine,

38:46.065 --> 38:48.684
uh, about this
rain check, uh...

38:48.768 --> 38:50.402
you're-you're probably
gonna get some leave

38:50.469 --> 38:51.937
in the next few months.

38:51.988 --> 38:53.939
Why don't we meet
somewhere halfway?

38:53.990 --> 38:56.141
I don't know.
Mumbai or something?

38:58.477 --> 39:01.279
I like Indian food.

39:22.268 --> 39:24.720
<i>I know, but if your mom</i>
<i>catches you</i>

39:24.804 --> 39:27.689
up this late,
she's gonna kill us both, okay?

39:27.774 --> 39:29.674
Go to bed, all right?

39:29.726 --> 39:32.527
And I'm gonna see you
really soon, and I can't wait,

39:32.612 --> 39:33.862
'cause I'm gonna kiss you

39:33.946 --> 39:37.149
all over
your little monkey face, okay?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.368
All right.

39:39.452 --> 39:41.870
Yeah, Danno loves you,
too, baby.

39:41.954 --> 39:44.022
All right.

39:45.408 --> 39:47.025
Okay.

39:56.535 --> 39:58.303
Detective Williams.

39:59.689 --> 40:00.756
What are you doing here?

40:00.840 --> 40:03.558
Uh, well, it's a nice night,

40:03.643 --> 40:05.677
and I was wondering
if you'd like

40:05.728 --> 40:09.047
to get a cup of coffee with me.

40:14.386 --> 40:16.387
I would like that.

40:32.121 --> 40:34.790
Chin, I'm really not up
for a lecture right now.

40:34.874 --> 40:37.342
Good, because I'm not here
to give you one.

40:38.594 --> 40:40.545
I'm here to apologize.

40:40.596 --> 40:45.250
Everything you're going
through right now

40:45.301 --> 40:47.436
I've been through myself.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.438
Getting kicked off the force,

40:49.522 --> 40:50.972
dealing with disappointment,

40:51.057 --> 40:53.975
the frustration,
the anger.

40:54.043 --> 40:57.395
I remember what that felt like.

40:57.447 --> 41:00.649
And I also remember that
the only person who stood by me

41:00.733 --> 41:04.202
through all of it was you.

41:06.906 --> 41:09.040
You're not alone in this, Kono.

41:11.610 --> 41:13.545
When you want to talk,

41:13.612 --> 41:16.298
