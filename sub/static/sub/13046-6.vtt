31:50.218 --> 31:52.519
I'm losing them in the brush!

31:52.521 --> 31:55.622
This is as close as I can get you!

31:57.492 --> 32:00.193
Then take us higher.

32:00.195 --> 32:03.263
Vulture Team, focus your firepower

32:03.265 --> 32:05.299
on the wave from the north.

32:05.301 --> 32:07.467
<i>We'll take care of the rest.</i>

32:07.469 --> 32:10.203
[Shouting continues]

32:16.311 --> 32:19.413
If we take a position
that creates the right angle

32:19.415 --> 32:22.449
for the five-inch, Nathan James
can take out the east flank.

32:22.451 --> 32:24.685
Once they lock onto our coordinates,

32:24.687 --> 32:26.620
we'll have plenty of time to scram.

32:26.622 --> 32:28.589
Got it!

32:28.591 --> 32:31.224
Nathan James, request
you target our location

32:31.226 --> 32:33.293
and prepare to fire the five-inch.

32:33.295 --> 32:34.761
Copy that, Nomad.

32:34.763 --> 32:35.565
Guns, T.A.O..

32:35.660 --> 32:38.065
Slew EOSS and get a
bearing and range on the helo.

32:38.067 --> 32:39.700
Guns, aye.

32:41.903 --> 32:44.137
[Whirring]

32:45.006 --> 32:47.374
I'm out!

32:47.376 --> 32:49.376
Nearly Winchester here, too.

32:49.378 --> 32:51.694
And here I thought we were in trouble.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.873
- [Chuckles]
- [More shouting]

32:54.016 --> 32:55.415
Vulture Team, Nathan James.

32:55.417 --> 32:56.817
Preparing to fire on your whiskey.

32:56.819 --> 32:58.719
You need to clear south-southwest.

32:58.721 --> 32:59.653
Do you copy?

32:59.655 --> 33:01.254
That way. That way.

33:01.256 --> 33:03.323
We copy, Nathan James,
but we're gonna need a minute.

33:03.325 --> 33:05.826
<i>Roger. Standing by.</i>

33:05.828 --> 33:08.161
[Banging]

33:08.163 --> 33:11.465
Nishioka: I got the helo.
Calculating firing solution now.

33:11.467 --> 33:14.267
If they can hold steady,
I can find a target

33:14.269 --> 33:16.136
and they can get out of the way.

33:16.138 --> 33:18.205
I can't lock on. The
shift is too strong.

33:18.207 --> 33:21.408
Nomad, we can not lock target.

33:26.180 --> 33:28.081
If you bank hard from a hover,

33:28.083 --> 33:31.918
how far can you get in 6.4 seconds?

33:31.920 --> 33:34.688
50, 60 yards, maybe.

33:36.190 --> 33:38.458
Nathan James.

33:38.460 --> 33:41.461
<i>Take your visual on us.
We will hold position.</i>

33:41.463 --> 33:43.096
<i>Give us a count.</i>

33:43.098 --> 33:45.465
You fire, we dive!

33:45.467 --> 33:48.535
That's too dangerous.

33:50.972 --> 33:53.640
Nomad, request approved.

33:53.642 --> 33:56.043
Expect incoming on my mark.

33:56.045 --> 33:59.012
T.A.O., request batteries
release on helo's position.

33:59.014 --> 34:01.014
Vulture Team, are you clear?

34:01.016 --> 34:04.551
It's now or never, sir!

34:04.553 --> 34:07.220
Start the countdown. Go, go, go, go, go!

34:09.956 --> 34:13.360
Five... four...

34:13.362 --> 34:14.995
You bank hard, girl.

34:14.996 --> 34:17.864
Two...

34:17.866 --> 34:20.600
Batteries release, kill target with guns!

34:21.768 --> 34:23.003
Shot over!

34:23.005 --> 34:23.704
Shot out!

34:23.706 --> 34:25.138
Hang on!

34:26.974 --> 34:28.175
[Screaming]

34:33.911 --> 34:35.413
[Helicopter blades whirring]

34:35.415 --> 34:37.715
[Tom coughing]

34:43.121 --> 34:44.288
You all right?

34:44.290 --> 34:46.791
[Groans] Yeah.

34:48.092 --> 34:51.329
Mike. Mike!

34:51.331 --> 34:53.531
You okay?

34:56.034 --> 34:58.169
- Never better.
- Come on.

34:58.171 --> 34:59.937
[Grunting]

34:59.939 --> 35:03.307
We're all good here, sir.

35:03.309 --> 35:06.210
[Panting]

35:06.212 --> 35:08.045
It's quiet.

35:08.047 --> 35:10.314
Kilo is clear!

35:10.316 --> 35:12.216
Target confirmed.

35:12.218 --> 35:15.253
<i>Enemy appears to be neutralized.</i>

35:15.255 --> 35:18.689
<i>Nice shooting, Nathan James!</i>

35:18.691 --> 35:20.825
Green, Taylor... secure the camp,

35:20.827 --> 35:22.827
find Miller and Rios.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.463
We're going after Takehaya.

35:25.465 --> 35:28.065
Yes, sir.

35:30.903 --> 35:34.572
At the last point of contact,
Nathan James was here.

35:34.574 --> 35:36.174
There are at least a dozen reasons

35:36.176 --> 35:38.009
why we might not have heard from them.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.477
Most likely, they went to Emcon.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.145
Without telling us?

35:41.147 --> 35:44.215
It's protocol, in the
case of imminent threat.

35:49.454 --> 35:51.656
[Chatter]

36:01.400 --> 36:02.533
[Groans]

36:02.535 --> 36:03.968
[Speaking Japanese]

36:09.608 --> 36:11.642
Aah! [Groans]

36:11.644 --> 36:13.144
- [Gun cocks]
- Stop!

36:16.014 --> 36:19.116
I don't care how
much she needs your blood.

36:19.118 --> 36:22.787
I will kill you if you
make one more stupid move.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.191
[Groaning]

36:33.332 --> 36:35.199
[Groaning stops]

36:36.535 --> 36:38.703
You okay, doc?

36:40.572 --> 36:42.039
I'm fine.

36:46.678 --> 36:50.014
Miller! Miller!

36:50.016 --> 36:51.182
Miller!

36:52.684 --> 36:53.684
Whoa! Hold!

36:53.686 --> 36:56.254
Leave! Now!

36:56.256 --> 36:57.555
Let him go

36:57.557 --> 36:58.856
It's over, Takehaya.

36:58.858 --> 37:00.958
What was it you said?

37:00.960 --> 37:04.095
"It's not over till I'm dead."

37:04.097 --> 37:05.796
That can be arranged.

37:05.798 --> 37:08.165
Take him down! Don't worry about
me, just take the shot!

37:16.742 --> 37:19.076
You don't want to die now.

37:19.078 --> 37:22.162
You have too much to live for.

38:15.934 --> 38:19.637
Lieutenant, where are we?

38:19.639 --> 38:23.274
Based on the trajectory of
the missile before it hit the UAV,

38:23.276 --> 38:26.110
we believe the Chinese
ship is loitering here...

38:26.112 --> 38:27.878
on the northeast side of the island.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.180
Probably one of their destroyers.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.182
You pick up any signals on SLICK 32?

38:31.184 --> 38:33.651
No, sir. So far, they've been quiet.

38:33.653 --> 38:35.653
Should we call St. Louis?

38:35.655 --> 38:37.121
We can't break Emcon.

38:37.123 --> 38:38.656
Not until we're out
of their engagement zone.

38:38.658 --> 38:41.926
Tell the bridge to head South
for open water at flank speed.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.661
Aye, sir.

38:43.663 --> 38:46.731
Good job today, Lieutenant.

38:46.733 --> 38:49.033
Thank you, sir.

39:57.736 --> 40:00.037
Master Chief...

40:00.039 --> 40:04.008
Hi. I'm Sasha Cooper.

40:04.010 --> 40:05.509
How you doing?

40:17.622 --> 40:19.623
[Groaning]

40:28.033 --> 40:31.902
How many we lose looking for us?

40:31.904 --> 40:34.638
Kudelski in the minefield.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.341
On the island...

40:37.343 --> 40:41.979
Wallace, Butler, Cruz.

40:44.115 --> 40:46.183
All my fault.

40:46.185 --> 40:47.852
Never should have
gone in that nightclub.

40:47.854 --> 40:50.588
There were coming for us,
Mike, no matter what we did.

40:50.590 --> 40:51.956
Who?

40:51.958 --> 40:56.093
The Chinese, Vietnamese, Takehaya?

40:56.095 --> 40:58.262
What the hell's going on, Tom?

41:01.566 --> 41:04.201
That's what we're going to find out.

41:06.071 --> 41:09.406
Get some rest.

41:09.408 --> 41:12.543
When you're ready, ship's yours.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.481
