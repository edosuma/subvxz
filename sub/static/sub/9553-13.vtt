01:22.870 --> 01:24.920
Oh, Richie,
close the door.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.920
It's freezing.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.920
I want to spend the night
at Jenny Piccalo's.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.430
Will you please tell Mom
she is not boy crazy?

01:32.430 --> 01:34.430
Oh, is that the only reason
you're helping me,

01:34.430 --> 01:35.300
so I'll talk to Mom?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.130
No, I also need 50 cents.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.130
Jenny Piccalo's charging
admission.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.970
Admission?
Yeah.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.600
She has a <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Sunbather magazine{\r}.</font></font></i>

01:44.720 --> 01:46.060
Shh, here comes Mom.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.060
Oh, children, I didn't
hear you come in.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.060
What happened?!

01:53.060 --> 01:54.560
I just cleaned this!

01:54.560 --> 01:55.570
Oh, Richie did it, Mom.

01:55.570 --> 01:56.870
Thanks.

01:56.870 --> 01:57.980
Can I spend the night
at Jenny Piccalo's?

01:57.980 --> 01:59.740
Oh...
Mom, this is the stuff
for the school

01:59.740 --> 02:01.240
time capsule project.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.070
Don't touch that.

02:02.070 --> 02:04.160
It's supposed to be at the gym.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.910
Well, Potsie dropped the
anchor on the gym floor,

02:06.910 --> 02:08.910
and the coach
attacked him

02:08.910 --> 02:10.410
with a barbell,
what was I supposed to do?

02:10.910 --> 02:12.250
I don't care
about that.
Mom!

02:12.250 --> 02:13.800
Can I go?
Richard,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.920
I am tired of picking
up after you.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.720
Well, you don't have
to pick up after me, Mom,

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
I'm trying to take
care of it myself.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.590
And this is
my responsibility.
Well, I work

02:20.590 --> 02:21.930
so hard around
here, I...

02:21.930 --> 02:23.430
Well, this is
very important...
Hi. Daddy's home.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.310
RICHIE:
You're not supposed
to know about it.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.930
(both arguing at once)

02:27.760 --> 02:30.770
Hi, Daddy's home.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.770
MARION:
Yes, Howard, dear.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.770
Dad, can I have
50 cents?

02:34.770 --> 02:36.690
Is that the way you greet
your father?

02:37.610 --> 02:39.110
(smooching loudly)

02:39.110 --> 02:41.110
Now, wait, wait, wait,
wait, hold it.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.110
How about one
for real, huh?

02:43.110 --> 02:45.500
There, you see,
money can't buy that.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.330
Howard, would you look
and see

02:47.830 --> 02:49.340
what your son has
done here?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.340
It's nice,
very nice.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.340
Mom, it's not my fault,

02:53.340 --> 02:54.790
if Dad wouldn't let us
use his vault.

02:54.790 --> 02:56.760
Well, why don't you put
the stuff in the garage?

02:56.760 --> 02:57.630
I can't put it
in the garage!

02:57.630 --> 03:01.550
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

03:01.550 --> 03:03.520
Hi, Daddy's home.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.440
Hi, Dad.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Oh, Howard.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.940
Oh, your nose
is cold, dear.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
I can't put it
in the garage

03:10.440 --> 03:11.940
because there's a hole
in the roof

03:11.940 --> 03:13.440
and water will get down
and ruin everything, Mom.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.450
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, stop!

03:15.450 --> 03:17.950
Look! Hold it, hold it!
That is enough.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.450
If you don't mind,

03:19.450 --> 03:21.730
I would like just
a few moments of
peace and quiet.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.210 --> 03:32.210
All right, I'm gonna
tell you something--

03:32.210 --> 03:34.210
I want you to call
the police.

03:34.210 --> 03:37.220
Someone stole one
of my T-shirts.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.720
Fonz, I've got
your T-shirt.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.220
You've got a whole closet
full of T-shirts.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.220
How did you know
one is missing?
They're numbered.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.560
You took number 23.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.760
You go find me
my T-shirt, huh?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.760
Oh, my mechanic's magazine here,
you take this, too, huh?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
I'm not taking
your magazine,

03:51.760 --> 03:53.770
and I'll find your
T-shirt, Fonz.
All right, now
look, look, look.

03:53.770 --> 03:55.270
This is ridiculous.
Will everybody
just calm down

03:55.270 --> 03:57.100
and we'll all get to the bottom
of this?

03:57.100 --> 03:58.910
You are the bottom
of this.

03:58.910 --> 04:01.190
I mean, look at this
room, dear.
Me?

04:01.190 --> 04:02.910
You wouldn't let us
use your vault, Dad.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.360
Yeah, I don't
understand.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.860
You have this old vault

04:05.860 --> 04:07.360
from when the store
was a pawn shop.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.370
And it's a good
thing, too,

04:09.370 --> 04:11.370
because we were robbed
three times last year.

04:11.370 --> 04:12.870
Yeah, but now you've got a safe,

04:12.870 --> 04:14.170
and you don't use that vault
for anything.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.960
Oh, yes I do.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.959
I have a hammock in
there; I take a nap.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.260
It's my place.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.050
A man has got to have a place
to get away from everything.

04:24.050 --> 04:25.550
You understand that,
don't you, Fonzie?

04:25.550 --> 04:28.430
I do indeed, but I
ain't your wife.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.300
Excuse me, boys.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.110
Howard,

04:32.110 --> 04:33.860
what do you really
do in that vault?

04:33.860 --> 04:37.360
I take Jane Russell there,
every day, for lunch.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.310
Marion, if I was gonna
do anything,

04:39.310 --> 04:40.810
I wouldn't do it
down at the store!

04:40.810 --> 04:42.650
Where would you do it?

04:48.320 --> 04:51.120
Take the vault, Richard,
it's yours.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.210
That's great, Dad.
Now I got a place.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.960
Yeah, well, I hope
you're satisfied.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.000
Now I have to call
Jane Russell

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
and tell her she can't
use the vault for a while.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.500
Oh, Howard,

05:02.500 --> 05:04.000
I'm sorry I acted
like that,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.920
I'm just upset
about all this mess.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.310
You know what?

05:07.310 --> 05:09.590
I'm gonna make you
a pork chop dinner.

05:09.590 --> 05:11.930
Listen, sweetheart,
this was all my fault.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.930
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.930
I'm gonna take you out
for a nice dinner.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.770
Just the two of
us alone, huh?

05:17.770 --> 05:19.070
I'll get my coat.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.070
Okay, I'll warm
up the car.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.070
Richard, have
a TV dinner.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.190
See you later, guys.

05:27.190 --> 05:30.200
I think you handled that
very well, Mr. C.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.120
I thought so, Fonzie.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.120
I hate pork chops.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.420
RICHIE:
Oh, okay,

05:36.420 --> 05:38.540
I found your T-shirt, Fonz,
you satisfied?

05:38.540 --> 05:39.840
Well, you're very lucky.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.760
Look...

05:40.760 --> 05:42.130
you gotta give us something

05:42.130 --> 05:43.680
for the time capsule
project, Fonz.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.180
Now think about this:

05:45.180 --> 05:47.460
In a hundred years, it's
gonna be the '50s again.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.180
Well, I never looked at it
that way.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.050
Yeah, right.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.880
And the people of those '50s

05:51.880 --> 05:53.890
are gonna want to know
about our '50s.

05:53.890 --> 05:55.890
And I think you should
be represented, Fonz.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.270
Those people are gonna want
to know about the Fonz.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.780
All right, all right,

06:01.780 --> 06:03.280
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do--

06:03.280 --> 06:05.280
I'll give you something
for your class project.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.280
Tell you the truth,
I don't know why,

06:07.280 --> 06:09.290
it's only a hundred years,

06:09.290 --> 06:10.790
I'm still gonna be here.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.790
Heyyy.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.990
(chorus humming
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Happy Days theme{\r})</font></font></i>

06:19.000 --> 06:20.080
You said you were just gonna

06:20.080 --> 06:21.580
have the place
for about an hour.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.500
Well, it's four hours.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.420
Hey don't worry, Al.
Guess what?

06:24.420 --> 06:26.420
We're putting one of your menus
in the time capsule.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.420
RICHIE:
Yeah.
Oh, that's nice.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.420
What's the specialty?

06:30.420 --> 06:32.430
Chicken fricassee
and meatballs.

06:32.430 --> 06:34.310
That's good, no fish.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.230
Now, you said
you needed one booth,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.560
and what did you do,
you set up tables!

06:38.560 --> 06:40.350
The place is a mess!

06:40.350 --> 06:42.820
Well, I know it got a
little out of hand, Al.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.240
Yeah, come on, Al,
be a pal.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.110
Yeah, you're
a second father!

06:46.110 --> 06:47.660
Such a nice guy.
Aw, come on.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.160
We'd be nothin'
without you, Al.
...best friends.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.660
What do you say?
Come on,
you're a good guy.

06:51.660 --> 06:54.000
I'm such a pushover.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.330
Hello,
I'm Miss Radcliff.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.340
Oh, hi.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.840
Before I go, I want
to thank you

07:00.840 --> 07:02.120
for letting us use
your restaurant.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.960
Oh, I like
to help the kids

07:03.960 --> 07:05.460
with their school
projects.

07:05.460 --> 07:06.960
I love them,
and they love me.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.460
That's nice.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.460
(yapping)

07:12.600 --> 07:14.430
Just kidding.
Yeah.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.440
Hey, hey,
let me use this.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.940
I want to make
my cook laugh--

07:17.940 --> 07:19.940
he has no life.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.890
Clarence,
close your eyes.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.900
Hi, Fonzie.
Nice hairdo, Al.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.900
Hey, uh, Cunningham.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
Hey, Fonz.
Fonzie.

07:33.900 --> 07:34.900
I said Cunningham.

07:34.900 --> 07:35.910
RALPH & POTSIE:
Oh, right, Fonz.

07:36.910 --> 07:38.410
Fonz, what did you
bring us, huh?

07:38.410 --> 07:39.830
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.
Oh, sorry.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.300
I was thinking about
what you said the other day

07:42.300 --> 07:44.750
about not being around
in a hundred years.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.550
Yeah, we're
all mortal.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.420
You're mortal,
I might move to California.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.420
So, I brought
with me...

07:52.420 --> 07:53.920
♪ Ta-da! ♪

07:53.920 --> 07:55.930
The original Fonzie
leather jacket.

07:57.340 --> 07:59.010
Oh.

08:01.730 --> 08:04.600
See that right there, that
lipstick stain right there?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
Yeah.
That's Lucy Bergdorf.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.600
I was seven, she was 16,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.520
and did she learn fast.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.410
That's terrific.
Yeah.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.910
You've been wearing leather
jackets for a long time.

08:15.910 --> 08:17.410
That's right.
What'd you wear
before that?

08:17.410 --> 08:19.420
Leather jammies?

08:19.420 --> 08:20.920
I didn't hear that,
Cunningham.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.830
I said did you wear
leather...

08:21.830 --> 08:25.250
I heard it!
Oh.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.260
And, uh, who is the
very sophisticated chick

08:27.260 --> 08:28.260
with the glasses?

08:28.260 --> 08:30.710
Oh, forget about
her, Fonz.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.710
She is one cold fish.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.210
She's from the Board
of Education,

08:35.210 --> 08:36.720
in charge of special
projects.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.179
(Radcliff claps)
All right,

08:38.179 --> 08:39.690
stop dallying, girls.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.690
Alfred has a business
to run here.

08:41.690 --> 08:43.110
Heyyy.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.190
He's saying hello.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.480
That's his way.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.280
Yes, see, he's
the Fonz.
Mm.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.280
On behalf of the Board
of Education,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.280
it's nice meeting you.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.290
(imitating Radcliff):
On behalf of the Board
of Education,

08:56.290 --> 08:58.290
it's nice
meeting you.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.990
Brrr.
RICHIE:
Yeah.

09:04.990 --> 09:07.580
I told you she's an icicle.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.380
Hey, defrosting is my specialty.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.880
Hey, Fonz.
All right.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.170
Let's get these
other boxes.
Yeah.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.470
Most of the boxes are gone.

09:15.470 --> 09:16.970
Is there anything else
you want us to do?

09:17.470 --> 09:19.310
Miss Radcliff told us to
do anything you want.

09:21.180 --> 09:23.980
I really like
this project.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.570
Yeah, girls, just load up
these last few boxes
and you can go home.

09:30.850 --> 09:32.860
He's such a Potsie.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.360
Well, listen, guys,

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
why don't you just let me
load up this last box,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.360
and you guys can go on
by yourselves, okay?

09:40.360 --> 09:41.660
He's right.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.450
We should try to get
to know Rebecca

09:43.450 --> 09:44.950
and Candy a little
better, Potsie.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.450
Oh, yeah.

09:46.450 --> 09:47.950
Let's take 'em up
to Inspiration Point.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.960
It's four degrees
outside.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.840
I don't do my best work
with mittens on.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.350
Look, you better
get going

09:56.350 --> 09:57.850
before the chicks
split on you.

09:57.850 --> 09:59.630
Right, see you,
Rich.
Right, see you.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.380
I'm ready, Richie,
let's go see your
father's vault.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.560
Yeah, we were just gonna
drop off these boxes

10:10.560 --> 10:11.980
and leave, that's all.

10:11.980 --> 10:13.400
Right-- to the vault,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.900
at the hardware store,
where it's warm...

10:15.900 --> 10:17.900
And there's lawn
furniture.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.780
Good idea, Rich.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.150
It was.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.120
CANDY:
Well, we're ready.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.120
Anything else you
want us to do?

10:24.120 --> 10:25.120
Uh, yeah, uh, girls,

10:25.120 --> 10:26.580
we're all going down
to the vault.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.580
Richie said we could help
pick out the things

10:28.580 --> 10:30.330
that go in the
time capsule.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.970
BOTH:
Good thinking, Rich.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.800
It's really
nice of you

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
to ask my friends
to go along.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.640
I didn't.
I didn't ask your friends.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.470
Come on, girls,
let's go get our coats.

10:41.470 --> 10:44.480
What a magnanimous gesture
on your part,

10:44.480 --> 10:47.480
to allow us to play
this role in history.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.480
What'd she say,
Malph?

10:51.480 --> 10:54.490
She's got 140 IQ--
I don't know.

10:54.490 --> 10:56.490
Boy, am I lucky.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.440
I'm going with the smartest
girl in the class!

10:59.440 --> 11:00.410
I'm more lucky.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.690
I'm with the dumbest.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.920
RICHIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Well, how do you
like the vault{\r}?</font></font></i>

11:08.920 --> 11:10.290
POTSIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">It's great!
Look at all this stuff{\r}.</font></font></i>

11:10.290 --> 11:13.170
RALPH:
We've even got mannequins
for chaperones.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.210
POTSIE:
Hey, a hammock.

11:14.210 --> 11:15.710
Hammock?

11:15.710 --> 11:17.710
Now what, may I ask, are
we gonna do with that?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.180
Sit on it, Rebecca.

11:22.130 --> 11:24.050
I still got it.

11:24.050 --> 11:27.300
Hey, hey,
that box moved!

11:27.300 --> 11:28.800
Hey, is somebody
in there?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.690
Come on out!

11:31.560 --> 11:33.560
RALPH:
All right, Fonz.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.560
POTSIE:
Hey.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.650
Sorry, Fonz,
we're just, uh,

11:38.650 --> 11:40.650
showing the girls
the vault.

11:40.650 --> 11:43.650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
a couple of lights, a wall,

11:43.650 --> 11:46.120
a very big, big
door-- good-bye.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.570
(thump)

11:47.570 --> 11:48.910
Is somebody else
in there?

11:48.910 --> 11:50.790
Hey, hey,
come on out.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.880
BOYS:
Miss Radcliff!

11:58.130 --> 11:59.840
RADCLIFF:
Well,

11:59.840 --> 12:01.800
everything seems
in its place,

12:01.800 --> 12:04.310
and you're all
in your place,

12:04.310 --> 12:06.810
and I'm leaving
this place.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.310
Yeah, yeah, uh, listen,
Miss Icecliff, uh...

12:09.310 --> 12:11.060
Radcliff.
Whatever.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.400
(singsongy):
You didn't tell me.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.400
(singsongy):
Do you think I
planned this?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
Listen, uh,
call me, huh?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.240
Mm.
All right.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.990
Check.

12:23.990 --> 12:26.030
So long, Miss Radcliff.

12:26.030 --> 12:27.530
Boy, do you have a way
with girls...
Oh, wait!

12:27.530 --> 12:29.030
What are you doing?

12:29.030 --> 12:30.030
What's the matter?

12:30.030 --> 12:31.500
You just locked us
in here!

12:31.870 --> 12:33.870
Oh, come on, Rich,
now, don't kid.

12:34.290 --> 12:35.870
I'm not kidding.

12:36.370 --> 12:37.340
What should we do?

12:38.790 --> 12:40.260
(screaming)

12:40.790 --> 12:42.290
Open the door!

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
Open up!

12:43.800 --> 12:45.800
Come back, come back,
please!

12:45.800 --> 12:46.630
No!

12:46.930 --> 12:50.020
Here we have a man
in complete self-control.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.520
(screaming)

12:51.520 --> 12:53.520
Open the door!

12:53.520 --> 12:54.970
(Ralph crying)

12:55.390 --> 12:56.980
RALPH:
Open...!

13:01.950 --> 13:02.980
(overlapping screaming
and shouting)

13:02.980 --> 13:04.480
You, Potsie!
Ralph!

13:04.480 --> 13:06.490
I didn't know!
I didn't...
You let us in here!

13:06.490 --> 13:07.490
Maniac...
You crazy?

13:07.490 --> 13:08.990
It was an
accident.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.990
What are we gonna do now?
What?! What?!

13:10.990 --> 13:12.490
Ralph, you're gonna be
very calm now.

13:12.990 --> 13:13.990
You're very...
You're cool, right?

13:13.990 --> 13:14.990
You okay?

13:14.990 --> 13:16.500
Right, Fonz.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
All right.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.000
Richie, open the door.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.000
I can't, Fonz.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.840
The vault only opens
from the outside.

13:23.090 --> 13:24.170
(high-pitched whimper)

13:24.170 --> 13:26.140
Ralph?

13:28.090 --> 13:31.090
Do you mean to tell me
that we are stuck in here?

13:31.090 --> 13:32.090
Well...

13:32.090 --> 13:33.600
(clears throat)

13:33.600 --> 13:36.600
Uh, my dad will be coming
to let us out... on Monday.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.600
(all gasping)

13:38.020 --> 13:39.070
It's Friday.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.100
It could be worse.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.910
Potsie, talking only
reminds me that you're here.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.740
All right,
everybody,

13:46.240 --> 13:47.740
now clear out
of the way.

13:47.740 --> 13:50.250
I'm going to get us
out of here.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.250
Just move away, girls.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.700
Are we out?

13:56.700 --> 13:59.210
I see stars.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.210
Uh, Ralph, this
is a steel door.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.710
You're going to need a
longer run with this one.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.210
Probably from
Albuquerque.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.210
I can't stand this.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.210
There's no air.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.720
I'm going to go crazy.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.050
I've got claustrophobia.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.390
Claustrophobia is an
emotional response

14:13.390 --> 14:14.890
to an irrational
problem.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.890
I'm going to shove
her 140 IQ...

14:16.890 --> 14:17.890
(all talking at once)

14:17.890 --> 14:19.390
No. Ralph, Ralph!
Ralph, stop it!

14:19.390 --> 14:21.390
All right, everybody
just take it easy.

14:21.390 --> 14:22.900
Just relax.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.400
There's no reason
to be frightened.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
We're all going
to get out of here...

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
Monday.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.040
All right, Rich,
here we are.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
You know, I think
it's dumb

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
that if girls get scared
they can cry,

14:39.040 --> 14:42.050
but the guys think
they got to put up a big front.

14:42.050 --> 14:45.550
All right, we're going
to have a new rule in here.

14:45.550 --> 14:47.500
From now on, no fronts.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.970
If you want to
cry, just cry.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.970
(wailing)

14:55.980 --> 14:57.260
Aw...
Oh...

14:57.480 --> 14:58.560
All right, all right,
take it easy.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.570
We got a disaster here.
I'm taking over.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.070
There's martial law now.
Get over here.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.070
All right.
All right, Fonz.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.070
Tell us what to do
so we can go home.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.020
All right, now we're all

15:06.020 --> 15:07.570
in the same predicament,
you understand?

15:07.570 --> 15:08.570
Except mine's a little worse.

15:08.570 --> 15:09.860
At least you have me.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.250
Okay, listen, anybody got gum,
candy, something like that,

15:14.250 --> 15:16.670
give it to me,
I'll ration it out, right?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.030
RICHIE:
Oh, Fonz, I think
I got some Jujubes here.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.950
Oh, well, they're
stuck to my pocket,

15:21.950 --> 15:23.960
but I could pick
out the lint, uh...

15:23.960 --> 15:26.960
Uh, Red, why-why don't you just
save that for later, all right?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.340
Just save 'em, okay?

15:28.630 --> 15:31.710
All right, we got no food,
so Potsie here is going to sing,

15:31.710 --> 15:34.220
and make us all forget
about our hunger, right, Pots?

15:34.220 --> 15:35.720
Oh, yeah, I'll
sing, Fonz.
Right.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.220
Here's a ukulele.

15:37.220 --> 15:39.220
Great. You know
how to play it?
Sure.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.110
POTSIE:
Hit it.

15:41.390 --> 15:42.470

15:44.480 --> 15:45.890

15:49.620 --> 15:51.980
RICHIE:
Right. Uh, Potsie,

15:52.200 --> 15:54.290
just play something we
could all sing to, okay?

15:54.290 --> 15:55.290
Oh, I'm hungry.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.290
Look, we're all
starving to death.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.290
No, no, not to
death, not to death.

15:59.790 --> 16:00.790
So-So just
play something,

16:00.790 --> 16:02.240
and-and get our
mind off food.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.660
Okay, we got it,
we got it-- ready?

16:04.660 --> 16:05.660

(Potsie hums melody)

17:01.770 --> 17:03.720
Still awake, huh, Fonz?

17:04.020 --> 17:05.609
Yeah, it's a bad habit I got.

17:05.609 --> 17:06.980
I don't sleep on the weekends.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.310
Yeah.

17:09.310 --> 17:12.280
I guess we really loused up
your date with Miss Radcliff.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.230
You didn't help.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.569
You want to sit down?

17:15.869 --> 17:16.950
Think it'll hold both of us?

17:17.450 --> 17:18.450
We'll find out.

17:18.450 --> 17:20.460
You know, Fonz, I was just
wondering something,

17:20.460 --> 17:22.960
and, well, you're going to say
it's kind of silly.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.960
There must be
a logical explanation for it...

17:24.960 --> 17:25.910
Just spit it
out, Cunningham.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.380
Well, see, it's just that, uh,

17:28.380 --> 17:32.380
I-I can't figure out
how the air gets in here.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.750
(laughs)

17:35.090 --> 17:37.170
Yeah, it looks like we
got a problem in that area.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.670
(both laughing)

17:38.670 --> 17:40.680
Yeah, I think we have
a big problem.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
(both laugh)

17:41.680 --> 17:43.680
Just don't tell them.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.680
Oh, yeah, I-I hate
to see girls cry.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
I hate to see Malph cry.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.690
(both laugh)

17:49.690 --> 17:51.690
Yeah.

17:51.690 --> 17:53.190
Yeah, we're in big trouble.

17:53.190 --> 17:54.690
Yeah.

17:54.690 --> 17:58.690
You know, Fonz, how
when-when you get in trouble,

17:58.690 --> 18:01.200
you start thinking
about your life?

18:01.200 --> 18:05.200
Well, see, I just realized that
I never kissed my Aunt Bessie.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.340
See, I always pull away.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.170
I... I just give her a hug.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.010
Well, so what?
You were a little kid.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.430
No, Fonz.
It was last Wednesday.

18:15.430 --> 18:16.430
And I'm telling you
something--

18:16.430 --> 18:18.430
if I get out of this
all right,

18:18.430 --> 18:19.430
things are going
to be different

18:19.430 --> 18:20.430
between me
and Aunt Bessie, Fonz.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.430
I'm going to change
my ways with her.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.140
I'm going to be a different
person, Fonz...

18:24.640 --> 18:26.440
Red, Red, why are
you talking so crazy?

18:26.610 --> 18:28.690
Because I'm nervous, Fonz!
I'm very nervous!

18:28.690 --> 18:30.690
All right, that happens
to be natural.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.190
I'm not even nervous.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.700
I'm scared.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.650
You probably don't know
about being scared, but...

18:35.650 --> 18:37.620
Well, let me tell you
something-- you've been

18:37.620 --> 18:39.450
on the road as long as I have,
you understand scared.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.320
Yeah, but you always said
you liked being on your own,

18:42.320 --> 18:43.660
how you never
needed a family.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.490
Hey, what am I going to say?

18:45.490 --> 18:47.990
You know, the only advice
my father ever gave me?

18:47.990 --> 18:49.500
He was just about
to leave home,

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
pats me on the head,
he says, "Fonzarelli..."

18:51.500 --> 18:53.000
Very warm man, my father.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
He said, "Fonzarelli,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.890
don't go out in the rain
in your socks."

18:59.810 --> 19:01.760
That... That's touching.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.180
What does it mean?

19:03.180 --> 19:04.680
I don't know.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.680
I've been trying
to figure that out for years.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.070
Well, we've got plenty
of time tonight, Fonz.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.680
(muffled):
I can't take it anymore.

19:36.680 --> 19:37.630
I got candy!

19:37.630 --> 19:39.090
I don't understand him.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.100
He's not enunciating.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.550
No, no-- I
think he said,

19:41.550 --> 19:43.520
"Loosen the bell.
The goat is home."

19:46.970 --> 19:48.970
What an odd thing to say.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.970
No. He's got candy,
and we're starving!

19:51.970 --> 19:53.980
(all talking at once)

19:55.480 --> 19:56.980
That's right.
Just hold it.

19:56.980 --> 19:58.980
Now what is this
all about, Ralph?

19:58.980 --> 20:00.370
Let go of his hand.

20:00.370 --> 20:03.240
I was going to hold out, Fonz,

20:03.240 --> 20:06.040
but I couldn't do it
to my friends.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.160
(door bell jingling
in distance, door shuts)

20:09.160 --> 20:11.160
I hear something.
I hear something!

20:11.160 --> 20:12.660
POTSIE:
I heard something, too.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.660
(all screaming
and shouting)

20:15.660 --> 20:17.080
Whoa!

20:17.080 --> 20:19.000
All you people do
is jump up and down

20:19.000 --> 20:20.500
and yell and scream
like that, huh?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.000
You want people to come in here

20:22.000 --> 20:23.340
and find a panic
with the Fonz around?

20:23.340 --> 20:25.670
Now, will you sit down
and have a picnic?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.680
I said sit down!
Hurry up, come on, sit down.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.150
Make nice.

20:31.150 --> 20:33.070
Ralph, will you get over there
with your friends?

20:37.850 --> 20:39.610
I knew I could open it.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.610
Nick, you clean out
the cash register,

20:41.610 --> 20:43.610
and I'll take the vault.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.450
Hey, there's kids in here!

20:46.450 --> 20:47.780
FONZIE:
Hey, wait a minute.
First of all,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.280
I ain't a kid.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.750
Second of all,
you touch one thing in here,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.700
I'll make your face look
like that permanently!

20:52.700 --> 20:54.090
Now get out
of here!

20:54.090 --> 20:55.590
Let's go, Harry!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.090
(door bell jingles)

20:59.090 --> 21:01.590
Those guys-- they
were robbers!

21:01.590 --> 21:03.510
We were saved by robbers.

21:03.510 --> 21:05.010
We're out of here!

21:05.010 --> 21:06.010
We're saved!

21:06.010 --> 21:07.020
(cheering and squealing)

21:07.020 --> 21:08.520
(door slams,
door bell jingles)

21:08.520 --> 21:10.020
I hear a noise.
They're coming back!

21:10.020 --> 21:11.520
Close the door!
No!

21:14.520 --> 21:17.390
You know, you never cease
to amaze me, Potsie.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.780
Sorry, Fonz.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.030
I lost my head.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.320
All right, now, listen,
I got the robber's license.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.320
Everybody go home.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.320
Oh. Hey, Becky?
Becky!
Yeah?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
When am I going
to see you again?

21:29.320 --> 21:31.820
When they open
the time capsule.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.830
Only kidding.
Oh.

21:33.830 --> 21:35.210
RALPH:
Let's go, Candy.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.080
But I'm driving
with the top down.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.080
I need all the air
I can get.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.080
I know it's cold.
You'll button up.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.050
(door bell jingles)
Great evening.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.090
You ought to get outside
once in a while.

21:44.090 --> 21:45.470
Air!

21:45.470 --> 21:46.840
Air!
I'll drive you home.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.170
I'm sorry
about tonight.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.060
It was fun.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.310
Can you get the vault
for tomorrow night?

21:52.310 --> 21:55.430
Yeah. I think that
can be arranged.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.820
You were very brave.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.780
Very brave.

22:07.780 --> 22:08.830
(soft chuckle)

22:08.830 --> 22:10.330
I'm glad I didn't cry.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.330
(store door opens, bell jingles,
door closes)

22:12.330 --> 22:13.750
FONZIE:
All right,
Richie, here.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.700
Here's the make of the car
and the license number.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.170
You give this to your father
to check it out, all right?

22:17.170 --> 22:18.670
Oh, good, Fonz.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.670
Listen, I-I got
to thank you for something.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.170
You know, everybody in here--

22:22.170 --> 22:24.680
they-they went a little crazy,
but-but not you.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.680
You know, you...

22:25.680 --> 22:28.180
Everybody was jumping up,
and then the robbers,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.680
and then... and then, you see,
we were all kind of...

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
but-but you were just...

22:31.680 --> 22:33.690
Am I making any sense, Fonz?

22:33.690 --> 22:35.190
Well, more sense than,

22:35.190 --> 22:37.140
"Don't wear your
socks in the rain."

22:39.610 --> 22:43.110
Boy, this was
a very interesting evening.

22:43.110 --> 22:45.900
You learn a lot about yourself
when you're under pressure.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.700
Yeah.
I learned that I never want

22:47.700 --> 22:49.200
to be under pressure with Ralph.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.700
RICHIE:
Yeah.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.200
You want this chair?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.710
Yeah... Yeah,
take that, Fonz.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.210
You know, something else.

22:56.210 --> 22:58.710
People act very different
when they're scared.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.710
Even you acted
a little different, Fonz.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.210
Oh, well, you mean that
conversation we had...

23:02.710 --> 23:03.720
Oh, no, no,
don't get me wrong,

23:04.220 --> 23:05.220
I didn't mean
you were scared.

23:05.220 --> 23:06.720
No, no.
You were never scared.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.170
You were just trying
to make me feel better.

23:08.170 --> 23:10.670
Yeah, right. I mean,
I don't get scared.

23:10.670 --> 23:12.140
No, Fonz.
Yeah, right.

23:14.180 --> 23:18.180
I know you know,
but he don't have to know.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.400
That's a little
pushy, Marion.
