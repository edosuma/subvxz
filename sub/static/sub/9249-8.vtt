WEBVTT

00:05.445 --> 00:07.513
Here we go.
Dinner is served.

00:07.514 --> 00:08.681
VINCE:
Thank God.

00:08.682 --> 00:09.949
I am starving.

00:09.950 --> 00:12.352
Nothing like that first meal
after a good colonoscopy.

00:12.353 --> 00:15.521
Seriously, I don't know
why people are so squeamish.

00:15.522 --> 00:17.557
My procedure today was
downright pleasant.

00:17.558 --> 00:18.891
In and out.

00:18.892 --> 00:21.059
I've had oil changes
that took longer.

00:21.061 --> 00:23.363
Now I'm just picturing you
up on some lift

00:23.364 --> 00:25.464
with a couple greasy
mechanics under you.

00:25.466 --> 00:27.232
Been there.

00:27.234 --> 00:29.702
Come on,
let the man crow.

00:29.703 --> 00:32.572
He's footloose
and polyp-free.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.608
Doctor said I had the
prostate of a 12 year old.

00:35.609 --> 00:38.944
Joyce, you still got the
picture in your purse?

00:38.946 --> 00:41.347
You're the one who wanted
to have a family meal.

00:41.348 --> 00:42.881
I know, but I
always forget

00:42.883 --> 00:45.685
that the family in my head is
never the one that shows up.

00:45.686 --> 00:47.019
(chuckles)

00:47.020 --> 00:47.987
Here it is.

00:47.988 --> 00:49.989
This is definitely going
on the fridge.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.122
Look at that colon.

00:51.124 --> 00:52.524
(groaning)
Huh?

00:52.526 --> 00:55.060
Pink as this ham.

00:56.395 --> 00:58.764
Wow, that's not
a bad lipstick color.

00:58.765 --> 01:00.031
What do you think, Mol?

01:00.033 --> 01:03.869
Well, as repulsed as I
am, it is encouraging

01:03.870 --> 01:06.372
to see a man take
responsibility for his health

01:06.373 --> 01:07.840
and actually go
to the doctor.

01:07.841 --> 01:08.873
VINCENT:
Oh, yeah.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.509
I go every daylight saving.

01:10.510 --> 01:12.578
Spring forward,
the doc checks the front.

01:12.579 --> 01:14.679
Fall back, he checks the crack.

01:14.681 --> 01:16.514
JOYCE:
And when was the last time

01:16.516 --> 01:17.949
he went to the doctor?

01:17.951 --> 01:19.084
Before me.

01:19.085 --> 01:20.619
That was his mother's
administration.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.054
Oh, come on, it wasn't
that long ago.

01:22.055 --> 01:24.123
I remember it was the year
the Cubs missed the World Series

01:24.124 --> 01:25.923
'cause that kid interfered
with that foul ball.

01:25.925 --> 01:29.961
That was 12 years ago; I helped
TP that bastard's house.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.929
12 years ago? Mike.

01:31.931 --> 01:33.766
Why should I go?
I feel great.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.501
If there's something wrong,
my body will tell me.

01:35.502 --> 01:38.002
What, are you deaf?

01:38.004 --> 01:39.638
Mike, it's not really
a big deal.

01:39.639 --> 01:41.640
You just get naked,
hop up on the table,

01:41.641 --> 01:44.810
put your feet in stirrups
and try not to sneeze.

01:44.811 --> 01:46.745
Please don't help.

01:46.746 --> 01:49.014
I already know what
the doctor's gonna do, okay?

01:49.015 --> 01:50.582
He's gonna charge me
for some cockamamy test,

01:50.583 --> 01:53.885
push some pills I don't need,
and tell me to lose 20 pounds.

01:53.886 --> 01:55.454
20?
Watch it,

01:55.455 --> 01:58.756
or you're gonna get a boot in
that pretty pink colon of yours.

01:58.758 --> 02:01.059
Mike, I'm only being a pest
because I love you,

02:01.060 --> 02:04.528
but know this:
I have not yet begun to nag.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.363
VICTORIA: Mike, you
really should go.

02:06.365 --> 02:07.798
JOYCE:
Don't be a baby.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.532
Grow a pair
and have them looked at.

02:09.535 --> 02:10.836
Yeah, why don't you just
make an appointment?

02:10.836 --> 02:13.604
Okay, if it will shut
you all up, I will do it.

02:13.606 --> 02:15.606
Thank you.
VINCENT: You won't regret it, pal.

02:15.608 --> 02:17.943
If you get your colon checked,
go to my guy.

02:17.944 --> 02:20.277
Steady hand
and generous with the lube.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.281
That's a good quality
in a doctor.

02:23.282 --> 02:25.015
And a lover.

02:25.017 --> 02:26.584
It's a...

02:26.585 --> 02:28.619
it's a different family.
I know.

03:02.060 --> 03:03.494
Hey, hon.

03:03.496 --> 03:05.129
Did you make
a doctor's appointment?

03:05.131 --> 03:07.965
Put that down,
and I'll tell you.

03:09.368 --> 03:10.702
No, I did not.

03:10.703 --> 03:12.603
(scoffs) And what's
today's excuse?

03:12.605 --> 03:14.939
'Cause you already used lost
your phone, lost the number,

03:14.941 --> 03:16.541
couldn't charge
your cell phone,

03:16.542 --> 03:20.811
bad reception, uh, too busy
giving CPR to a police horse.

03:22.147 --> 03:25.183
Well, today wasn't as heroic,
but it was just as frustrating.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.118
I-I called, and then I got lost

03:27.119 --> 03:28.753
in that stupid
automated phone system.

03:28.754 --> 03:30.522
I pressed one and ended up
on a Spanish menu,

03:30.523 --> 03:33.524
then I got bounced from
<i>departmente</i> to <i>departmente.</i>

03:35.260 --> 03:37.728
I just got the hell
out of there.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.097
Okay.

03:39.098 --> 03:40.432
You can call them now.

03:40.433 --> 03:41.699
Whoa, no can do.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.567
The close at cinco-thirty.

03:45.637 --> 03:47.672
All right, can we just stop
with the charade?

03:47.673 --> 03:48.939
I already made you
an appointment.

03:48.941 --> 03:50.041
What?
Yeah.

03:50.042 --> 03:53.111
<i>Mañana</i> morning
at <i>ocho</i> o'clock.

03:53.112 --> 03:54.512
Molly, that's
too soon.

03:54.513 --> 03:55.779
I got to prepare.

03:55.781 --> 03:57.849
I mean, I got to get
some time off of work.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.349
I got to buy clean underwear.

03:59.351 --> 04:01.986
Yep, I already cleared it
with your boss.

04:01.987 --> 04:05.489
And there's a three-pack of
tighty-whities on the bed.

04:06.758 --> 04:09.226
You didn't have to do that.
I'm not a baby, you know.

04:09.228 --> 04:11.195
Well, then when you get a shot,
maybe you won't cry.

04:11.197 --> 04:13.363
Shot? Nobody said
anything about needles.

04:20.238 --> 04:22.807
How the hell am I supposed
to know my group plan number?

04:22.808 --> 04:24.108
Same as mine.

04:24.109 --> 04:26.978
5-0-7, 1-2-3, M, double-O, 1.

04:26.979 --> 04:29.079
You've got it memorized?

04:29.081 --> 04:31.082
Of course I do; got to know it
for my dermatologist,

04:31.083 --> 04:33.783
my orthopedist, my internist,
my ENT and my hypnotist.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.722
Helped me quit smoking
and moderate my foot fetish.

04:40.524 --> 04:42.493
Of course, you love
going to the doctor.

04:42.494 --> 04:44.729
Taking off your shirt,
showing off all your muscles,

04:44.730 --> 04:46.864
parading around
for all the nurses.

04:46.865 --> 04:48.065
Yeah, well, I don't parade,

04:48.066 --> 04:51.701
but if the door is open,
the door is open.

04:51.703 --> 04:53.571
A-And by the way,
those gowns are optional;

04:53.572 --> 04:55.572
you don't have
to wear them.

04:55.574 --> 04:58.409
Do you know what it's like for a
guy my size to go to the doctor?

04:58.410 --> 05:00.011
It's humiliating, okay?

05:00.012 --> 05:01.679
My whole life
I've spent layering

05:01.680 --> 05:02.980
so I can cover all this.

05:02.981 --> 05:04.748
Here, it's on full
display, nude.

05:04.749 --> 05:06.984
I can't even put
a tasteful scarf on the lamp

05:06.985 --> 05:09.719
like I do at home.

05:09.721 --> 05:12.256
Man, being naked is the last
thing you have to worry about.

05:12.257 --> 05:13.824
I'd be more concerned
about what's going on

05:13.825 --> 05:15.826
under that husky hood,
you know?

05:15.827 --> 05:17.261
Your blood pressure,
cholesterol,

05:17.262 --> 05:19.295
glucose levels,
triglycerides,

05:19.297 --> 05:21.130
your bad knees,
your sciatica.

05:22.766 --> 05:25.769
Low testosterone,
high estrogen.

05:25.770 --> 05:27.438
And that skin tag village
on your neck

05:27.439 --> 05:29.705
I got to look at
eight hours a day.

05:29.707 --> 05:32.076
Whatever problems I
might have will go away

05:32.077 --> 05:33.677
if I just lose
a little weight.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.711
In fact, that's probably all
he's gonna tell me anyway.

05:35.713 --> 05:38.247
If he doesn't,
you need to change doctors.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.218
Maybe I should save us
a lot of embarrassment...

05:41.219 --> 05:42.818
lose the weight
and then come back.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.788
Yeah, I don't think
Molly would like that.

05:44.789 --> 05:46.623
Well, that's why you're
not gonna tell her.

05:46.624 --> 05:47.623
Where are you going?

05:47.625 --> 05:49.325
Get my diet started.

05:49.327 --> 05:52.161
You heard what I think
the doctor's probably gonna say.

05:56.767 --> 05:57.734
I am so sorry.

05:57.735 --> 05:59.736
Yes, we will try
and reschedule.

05:59.737 --> 06:02.905
I'm sure he had his reasons
for running out like that.

06:02.907 --> 06:04.841
No, there wasn't
a family emergency.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.878
That won't happen
until he gets home.

06:07.879 --> 06:09.379
Okay.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.213
All right, well, thank you.

06:11.215 --> 06:13.816
Well, the big chicken
flew the coop.

06:15.652 --> 06:17.153
Ah, don't worry about it.

06:17.154 --> 06:20.323
Took me a long time to train
Vince to go to the doctor.

06:20.324 --> 06:21.992
Finally fed him
some beets.

06:21.993 --> 06:24.627
He thought he was
crapping blood.

06:25.629 --> 06:28.431
Been going twice a year since.

06:28.432 --> 06:30.033
That's not gonna work.

06:30.034 --> 06:32.201
Mike won't eat beets.

06:32.203 --> 06:34.403
Well, Carl loves to be naked.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.474
And?

06:38.476 --> 06:40.410
That's it.

06:40.411 --> 06:43.046
He just loves to be naked.

06:43.047 --> 06:44.714
You know, Mike's always saying
that he doesn't want me

06:44.715 --> 06:46.349
to treat him like a baby,
but right now

06:46.350 --> 06:47.750
I'd like to swat him
on the bottom

06:47.751 --> 06:49.484
and put him to bed
without a bottle.

06:49.486 --> 06:50.752
Carl likes that, too.

06:50.754 --> 06:53.056
All right,
all right, okay.

06:53.057 --> 06:56.059
See, the problem is you're
treating him like a child,

06:56.060 --> 06:58.827
when you should be
treating him like a dog.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.598
I'm listening.

07:02.599 --> 07:05.033
Look, remember how we used
to get Monroe to the vet?

07:05.035 --> 07:07.737
Trail of Snausages
to the back of the car.

07:07.738 --> 07:09.672
He thinks he's going
to the park.

07:09.673 --> 07:12.074
Next thing you know,
his balls are gone

07:12.075 --> 07:14.409
and he's not humping
you girls anymore.

07:17.013 --> 07:20.715
Mom, I want to send him
to the doctor, not neuter him.

07:20.717 --> 07:22.685
Hey, I'm just saying.

07:22.686 --> 07:24.720
Get him there.

07:24.721 --> 07:26.721
And then decide.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.695
Wow, this is great.

07:32.696 --> 07:34.797
I didn't even know
the air show was in town.

07:34.798 --> 07:36.832
Plus, all those mini Kit-Kats
in the driveway?

07:36.833 --> 07:38.134
What a morning!

07:38.135 --> 07:40.136
Well, you deserve it.

07:40.137 --> 07:41.303
Such a good boy.

07:41.304 --> 07:44.773
Going to the doctor,
you're such a good boy.

07:44.775 --> 07:46.307
It wasn't a big deal.

07:46.309 --> 07:47.475
Like it was nothing.

07:47.477 --> 07:49.577
Exactly.

07:49.579 --> 07:52.480
Hey, wait, isn't the airfield
the other way?

07:52.482 --> 07:55.049
You know what the funny thing
is about doctors?

07:55.051 --> 07:56.251
What's that?

07:56.253 --> 07:58.620
When you ditch an appointment,
they call to reschedule.

07:58.622 --> 07:59.788
(doors lock)

07:59.789 --> 08:02.057
Wait, where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

08:02.058 --> 08:03.926
Where you should have
gone two days ago.

08:03.927 --> 08:06.427
Aw, we can't go to the doctor's;
we'll miss the air show.

08:06.429 --> 08:08.696
There is no air show!

08:08.698 --> 08:10.765
You lied?!
You lied first.

08:10.767 --> 08:12.668
You didn't even go
to the doctor.

08:12.669 --> 08:14.269
Oh, I went, I just didn't stay.

08:14.270 --> 08:15.703
Unlock this door.

08:15.705 --> 08:16.839
Go ahead.
(doors unlock)

08:16.840 --> 08:17.872
Jump out.

08:17.874 --> 08:19.141
I'm going 30. Either way,

08:19.142 --> 08:21.676
you are gonna see
a medical professional.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.914
It's tight.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.616
That's very tight.

08:36.618 --> 08:38.618
Uh, it's pinching.
Do you know what you're doing?

08:38.620 --> 08:40.820
Yeah, I do.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.024
Just know, if my blood
pressure is high,

08:44.025 --> 08:46.159
it's 'cause of you.

08:46.161 --> 08:47.528
Step on the
scale, please.

08:47.529 --> 08:49.896
(groans) Is that
really necessary?

08:49.898 --> 08:52.165
You want me to guess?

08:52.167 --> 08:56.402
Fine, but you better subtract
a couple pounds for this gown.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.087
There you go.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.826
How about a little bedside
manner for the next guy, huh?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.528
Start high, go low.

09:21.529 --> 09:22.963
Now for your height.

09:22.964 --> 09:25.031
Six feet on the dot
since I'm 17.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.500
Five-eleven.

09:26.501 --> 09:27.834
What?!

09:27.835 --> 09:30.302
That's impossible.
Do it again.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.872
The doctor will be
right with you.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.653
Mr. Biggs, nice
to meet you.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.886
I'm Dr. Wexler.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.290
So, how are we
feeling today?

09:50.291 --> 09:52.424
Well, not great
to be honest.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.094
And I don't want
to get anybody fired,

09:54.095 --> 09:56.595
but your girl there was a little
stingy with the height bar.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.934
So, I see here you haven't
had a check-up since, uh...

10:00.935 --> 10:03.369
Wow, turn of
the century.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.038
I just don't see
the point, Doc.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.639
You're just gonna tell me
I'm too fat

10:06.640 --> 10:08.207
and I need
to lose some weight.

10:08.209 --> 10:11.243
Yeah, but I'd say
it nicer than that.

10:11.245 --> 10:13.613
And I would also say...

10:13.614 --> 10:16.482
Deep breath.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.483
Again.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.753
...that you're at an age
where carrying that weight

10:20.754 --> 10:22.988
can cause serious
medical problems.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.957
I know, dude.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.793
Deep breath, please.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.229
Ow.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.597
Is that tender?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.533
I wouldn't say tender.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.200
Ow! Stop it.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.968
How long has that
area been sensitive?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.104
I don't know;
nobody ever touches those.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.107
Hmm, well, it's
probably nothing,

10:41.108 --> 10:43.808
but just to be safe, we should
do some follow-up tests.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.944
What does that mean?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.178
Means I'd like to
get some images,

10:46.179 --> 10:47.278
see what's going
on in there.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.382
Make sure
everything's okay.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.983
No, everything's okay.
I just wasn't ready.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.151
Here, here, d-do it again.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.155
You got a bony finger.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.723
You'll be happy about
that in a minute.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.430
Look at this.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.698
I posted my colon picture
on Facebook.

11:08.434 --> 11:11.202
I already got
30 likes.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.671
It's a good-looking
picture.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.206
You better not put that
on ChristianMingle.com.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.710
VICTORIA:
There he is.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.480
How was the air show?

11:21.481 --> 11:24.516
Really?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.384
So, what'd
the doctor say?

11:26.386 --> 11:29.020
I don't want
to talk about it.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.024
Poor guy probably just got
his first prostate exam.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.393
Let's just leave him alone and
let him sort out his feelings.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.397
(scoffs)
Is he okay?

11:39.399 --> 11:42.467
Yeah, the doctor found
a little cyst in his chest.

11:42.468 --> 11:46.103
He thinks it's nothing, but he
wants Mike to get a mammogram.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.472
What?
Oh, no.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.840
How scary for him.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.842
Okay, we're not making
a big deal out of this.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.177
You know, he just wants to
rule out anything more serious.

11:53.179 --> 11:57.214
Are you telling me guys got to
worry about their boobs now?

11:57.216 --> 11:59.316
It's a lot more common
than you think.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.286
Oh, God, I thought
we just had to worry

12:01.287 --> 12:04.455
about the ball,
the bat and the dugout.

12:06.191 --> 12:07.959
Oh, God, I feel
something!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.661
Joyce, what is that?

12:09.662 --> 12:10.695
It's your nipple.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.029
Has it always
been that big?!

12:12.031 --> 12:13.631
ALL:
Yes.

12:18.069 --> 12:21.171
Mike, don't start looking up
breast lumps on the Internet.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.041
You're just gonna
upset yourself.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.010
Oh, I wasn't. I'm looking
at air show videos.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.978
You know, like I was promised.

12:27.980 --> 12:33.150
Listen, I know that the idea
of a mammogram is scary.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.786
No, it's not,
'cause I'm not getting one.

12:34.787 --> 12:35.953
Doctor said it was nothing.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.122
He said it was
"probably nothing."

12:37.123 --> 12:38.356
Well, that's close
enough for me.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.791
Well, not for me.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.426
Well, it doesn't matter
'cause it's my body.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.926
We're done talking about it.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.395
It's just a little test;
women do it all the time.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.765
And I am a man, ready to
deal with manly problems.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.701
It's a hernia, I just
push it back in.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.369
High cholesterol, choke
down some egg whites.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.770
But a fatty lump
in my breast?

12:52.771 --> 12:54.938
Come on, what am I
supposed to do with that?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.440
Get checked out?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.142
Ah, you're a dog
with a bone, lady.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.711
It's not happening.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.512
Yes, it is, because I love
you, and you made a vow

13:02.514 --> 13:04.282
to spend the rest of
your life with me.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.284
And damn it, it's gonna
be a long happy life

13:06.285 --> 13:08.285
whether you
like it or not!

13:08.287 --> 13:10.254
Yeah, well...

13:10.255 --> 13:12.422
Oh, stop loving me
so much!

13:13.991 --> 13:15.525
What?

13:19.664 --> 13:22.333
You know what the problem
with our health care system is?

13:22.334 --> 13:24.035
Too many people
going to the doctor

13:24.036 --> 13:25.836
just 'cause
something hurts.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.872
Uh, isn't that why
we're supposed to go?

13:27.873 --> 13:29.539
No, that's why <i> you</i> go.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.942
And everybody else
who's a hypochondriac.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.210
I'm old school...
something hurts,

13:33.211 --> 13:35.178
you rub dirt on it
and walk it off.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.214
Rub dirt on it?

13:37.215 --> 13:38.481
That's how you get ringworm.

13:38.483 --> 13:41.786
Which is not
a real worm.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.755
It's a fungus;
it clears up on its own.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.689
Eventually.

13:46.691 --> 13:49.693
The old Mike Biggs "ignore it
and it'll go away" strategy?

13:49.694 --> 13:51.362
Well, that's better
than the Carl McMillan

13:51.363 --> 13:53.196
"everything's
something" strategy.

13:53.198 --> 13:55.199
You remember that heart attack
you had last year

13:55.200 --> 13:57.134
that turned out
to be gas?

13:57.135 --> 14:00.571
Huh? Appendicitis that
turned out to be gas?

14:00.572 --> 14:02.706
Huh? Slipped disc?

14:02.707 --> 14:04.441
Gas!

14:04.442 --> 14:05.709
You don't need a doctor,

14:05.710 --> 14:08.679
you need to quit
drinking ginger ale.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.647
So good though.

14:10.648 --> 14:12.216
Look, I'm just saying,

14:12.217 --> 14:15.485
my way of doing things
has worked out fine so far.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.521
All right, well, the key
phrase there is "so far."

14:17.522 --> 14:19.490
All right? You didn't just
roll off the showroom floor.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.858
You've logged
a lot of hard miles

14:20.859 --> 14:23.125
on that cement truck
you call a body.

14:23.127 --> 14:25.028
All right, I may have suffered
a few dings and dents

14:25.029 --> 14:27.331
along the way, but that's
no reason to assume the worst.

14:27.332 --> 14:29.065
Hey, I'm not assuming the worst.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.936
'Cause you go on that Internet,
you scare yourself to death.

14:33.938 --> 14:36.006
Stay in your bed all night,
feeling yourself up,

14:36.007 --> 14:37.440
thinking "what if."

14:37.442 --> 14:39.910
Is that why you were
so tired today?

14:39.911 --> 14:41.378
I didn't sleep a wink.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.879
That's all the more reason you
need to go get it checked out.

14:43.881 --> 14:46.216
You know, so we can find out
it's only a pulled muscle.

14:46.217 --> 14:47.851
You know, or a gas bubble.

14:47.852 --> 14:50.886
Or you pinned yourself with
your badge a few too many times.

14:50.888 --> 14:53.722
I do do that.

14:53.724 --> 14:55.692
Exactly.

14:55.693 --> 14:59.763
Hmm, you've probably just got
yourself a case of badge boob.

14:59.764 --> 15:01.031
You think that's
what it is?

15:01.032 --> 15:02.765
Well, that's what
we're here to find out.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.433
Imaging center's on the left.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.468
Ah, you got to be kidding me.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.504
Hey, Molly made the appointment,

15:07.505 --> 15:09.105
I was just supposed
to get you here.

15:09.106 --> 15:10.974
Oh, and she also wants you
to take a picture

15:10.975 --> 15:12.141
with the radiologist for proof.

15:12.143 --> 15:15.077
Fine.

15:15.079 --> 15:17.414
But just know,
someday, somehow,

15:17.415 --> 15:19.748
somebody is taking me
to an air show.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.585
Good luck!

15:22.586 --> 15:24.119
(can opens)

15:26.990 --> 15:29.124
God, that's so good.

15:35.031 --> 15:37.466
Are you waiting
for your wife?

15:37.468 --> 15:40.602
Oh, no, hers are perfect,
mine are a little sketchy.

15:42.138 --> 15:45.375
I'm just really uncomfortable;
it's my first time here.

15:45.376 --> 15:46.575
WOMAN 2:
I understand.

15:46.577 --> 15:49.245
First mammogram I
got, I was petrified.

15:49.246 --> 15:52.214
Now I just go in, get
squished and get out.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.318
I'm sorry, "squished"?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.920
Has anyone told you what's
gonna happen in there?

15:58.922 --> 16:03.092
Well, my wife tried,
but I put a pillow over my head.

16:03.093 --> 16:04.193
It takes five minutes.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.062
They put your breasts
on a plate of glass,

16:06.063 --> 16:07.730
position it,
then another plate comes down.

16:07.731 --> 16:10.265
Like a marshmallow
between two graham crackers.

16:12.535 --> 16:16.838
Only thing missing is a piece
of chocolate and a ghost story.

16:17.940 --> 16:20.409
My partner and I just busted
a crack house,

16:20.410 --> 16:23.478
and it's not as scary as this.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.080
Look, you got nothing
to worry about.

16:25.081 --> 16:26.782
Unless they
find something.

16:26.783 --> 16:28.184
They caught mine
pretty early.

16:28.185 --> 16:29.851
Now I'm five
years clean.

16:29.853 --> 16:30.786
Ah, that's great.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.187
WOMAN 1: But you
got to be diligent.

16:32.189 --> 16:33.556
You know, early detection
is the key...

16:33.557 --> 16:35.524
that's why I come
every year.

16:35.525 --> 16:37.192
Thing about cancer,

16:37.193 --> 16:40.328
can't just ignore it and
wish for it to go away.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.964
Wow.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.066
You ladies are
a lot braver than I am.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.099
But you're here.

16:45.101 --> 16:46.801
That takes a
lot of courage.

16:46.803 --> 16:49.805
No, it takes a lot of deceit
on my wife and partner's part.

16:49.806 --> 16:52.673
But... thank you.

16:54.009 --> 16:55.977
Ma?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.915
Molly told me.

16:59.916 --> 17:02.183
I thought you could
use some company.

17:05.887 --> 17:08.055
Thanks, Ma.

17:10.892 --> 17:14.161
Just so you know, you get
the lumpy breasts from me.

17:17.232 --> 17:19.834
Like two socks
full of gum balls.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.384
Well, I'm glad your lump
turned out to be nothing.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.719
I'd hate for anything to happen
to that sweet rack of yours.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.421
(laughs)
Thanks, honey.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.523
Can I, uh, see
the tickets again?

17:39.525 --> 17:43.460
Mike, you went to the doctor;
the air show is real this time.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.463
Well, excuse me for thinking
you might be taking me

17:45.464 --> 17:47.498
to the dentist to get
my rotten tooth looked at.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.901
You said you took care of that
six months ago.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.503
Did I? (chuckles)

17:52.505 --> 17:54.506
Hey, check out
my neck, huh?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.275
Skin tag village,
population zero.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.410
That's nice.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.979
You know, Mol, there's no reason
to be afraid of the doctor.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.948
Are you kidding?
I go twice a year.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.984
Three times if you
include the dentist,

18:05.985 --> 18:07.552
which is where
you're going next.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.686
Oh, I hate the dentist.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.355
All those metal tools
in my mouth.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.990
There's worse places
metal tools can go.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.392
You want to hear about my
last gynecological exam?

18:14.393 --> 18:15.527
No.
Oh, really?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.228
Well, first she
takes the speculum...

18:17.229 --> 18:19.897
in case you didn't know, it's
like a cold metal salad tong.

18:19.898 --> 18:20.999
Okay, enough, enough!

18:21.000 --> 18:23.590
Then she scrapes my
cervix. My cervix!

18:23.591 --> 18:26.528
Okay, I'll go to the dentist!
Just make it stop!
