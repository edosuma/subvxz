WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:09.635
You should've been there last night,
you would've loved it.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.095
Two warriors
squaring off in the ring.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.889
l had plans with McGee.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.683
Mud glistening off their thongs.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.685
Wait, back up a second.
You were with McGeek?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.812
No, he was with me.
l was making him dinner.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.440
Why would you make
McGeek dinner?

00:23.607 --> 00:25.984
- l like to cook.
- You cook?

00:26.151 --> 00:28.362
- Jimmy seemed to like it.
- Palmer?

00:28.529 --> 00:31.615
l've never even been to your place
and you're cooking dinner for McGee

00:31.782 --> 00:33.367
and the autopsy gremlin?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.911
At what point did the Earth
come off its axis?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.372
Perhaps now, Tony.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.915
What's wrong with that picture?

00:40.082 --> 00:42.084
Containers aren't unloaded
at the dock.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.643
Clear.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.563
Custom seal's been broken.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.605
Tony!

01:15.826 --> 01:17.327
Get inside.

01:40.392 --> 01:43.020
l think we've just been screwed
in here, Tony.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.147
The term is ''bolted.''

01:45.314 --> 01:47.024
Same difference.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.046
l tried that. Bolted from the outside.

02:42.213 --> 02:43.464
l knew your idea was stupid.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.466
My idea?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.553
Yes. Taking up a defensive position
inside a metal box. Yes.

02:48.719 --> 02:51.013
- You're not panicking on me, are you?
- l don't panic.

02:51.222 --> 02:54.100
This is me, mad.

02:58.396 --> 03:01.524
l'm not getting any reception.
How about you?

03:05.820 --> 03:08.906
- l'm braless.
- l noticed that earlier.

03:09.073 --> 03:12.493
- But on your phone they're ''bars.''
- Don't you have anything better to do

03:12.660 --> 03:13.911
than correct my English?

03:14.537 --> 03:16.664
- Like what?
- Like getting us out of this box

03:16.873 --> 03:19.333
- you trapped us in.
- Okay, first of all,

03:19.917 --> 03:22.295
this is not my fault.

03:22.503 --> 03:27.258
Second of all, l like dark,
tight spaces.

03:27.925 --> 03:32.930
Unless, of course, they insist
on some form of commitment.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.642
l was referring
to my childhood bedroom.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.689
lt looks like our smugglers
have removed most of the cargo,

03:41.856 --> 03:44.025
so they're probably
not coming back.

03:44.192 --> 03:49.655
We're still locked in a box
and freezing to death.

03:49.822 --> 03:51.532
Somebody might have heard
the gunfire.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.160
Yeah, well, if they did,
they'd be here by now.

03:54.327 --> 03:57.997
You know what we could do? Fire
a couple of rounds out of these shafts.

03:58.164 --> 04:00.291
- Maybe someone will hear us.
- Oh, yeah.

04:00.458 --> 04:03.544
Maybe they didn't hear
the massive firefight.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.255
So let's just waste
the little ammunition we have.

04:06.422 --> 04:08.633
You know what?
You're brilliant. Genius.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.636
Sarcasm is the refuge
of a shallow mind.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.597
What do you suggest we do?

04:16.057 --> 04:19.101
l suggest we bust out of here now.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.313
Okay, Bugsy, l'll take care of the
security guard and go through the--

04:22.480 --> 04:24.857
- This is not funny. lt's not funny.
- l know.

04:26.442 --> 04:31.405
What we need to do is relax
and remain calm,

04:32.198 --> 04:34.325
and wait.

04:34.909 --> 04:36.160
For what?

04:36.828 --> 04:39.705
For them to come in
with reinforcements?

04:41.415 --> 04:42.875
For Gibbs.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.920
Trust me, he'll find us.

04:50.216 --> 04:52.301
l believe you.

04:52.468 --> 04:54.595
The question is,

04:54.762 --> 04:57.807
will it be before
we freeze to death?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.520
<i>Our intel was wrong, Gibbs.</i>

05:02.687 --> 05:04.438
<i>The container isn't filled
with small arms,</i>

05:04.605 --> 05:06.732
<i>- it's a shipment of explosives--
- C-4?</i>

05:06.941 --> 05:10.111
<i>Worse. Unexploded
KMGU cluster bomblets.</i>

05:10.278 --> 05:12.321
<i>- From where?
- lraq.</i>

05:12.488 --> 05:15.241
<i>Al-Qaeda pays kids 50 cents a day
to collect the bomblets.</i>

05:15.408 --> 05:18.161
<i>Most of them end up dead,
the lucky ones, crippled.</i>

05:18.327 --> 05:20.705
<i>- These bomblets are--
- Highly unstable.</i>

05:20.872 --> 05:22.790
Yeah, l'd say that's worse.

05:22.957 --> 05:25.418
<i>French intelligence out of Dakar
believe they may have been loaded</i>

05:25.626 --> 05:28.921
<i>- onto a Senegalese ship last week.
- Last week?</i>

05:29.547 --> 05:31.549
Why are we just hearing
about this today?

05:31.716 --> 05:33.634
<i>Have you ever worked
with the French, Gibbs?</i>

05:38.473 --> 05:40.308
Yeah, a few times.

05:40.475 --> 05:42.852
<i>Then you know what l'm up against.</i>

05:43.060 --> 05:45.271
l've got two agents down
at the docks.

05:45.438 --> 05:47.148
l need more than
''They may have been loaded

05:47.315 --> 05:50.526
<i>- on a Senegalese ship,'' Tom.
- We're working on it, Jethro.</i>

05:50.693 --> 05:53.404
<i>- Just tell your people to be careful.
- Where are they now, McGee?</i>

05:53.571 --> 05:55.406
Tony said that they were relocating.

05:56.699 --> 05:59.494
- Why?
- Said that they had new intel.

06:00.703 --> 06:02.830
Are you waiting for me
to say please?

06:03.039 --> 06:06.167
l couldn't really make it out.
The phone reception was already hinky

06:06.334 --> 06:08.711
- before l lost them.
- Well, un-lose them.

06:08.878 --> 06:12.548
l don't want them touching anything
without a bomb squad present.

06:18.471 --> 06:20.515
Pinch me now.

06:21.974 --> 06:24.101
Another crate of movies.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.479
Look at them all.

06:26.646 --> 06:30.399
Maybe there's a crate
full of DVD players in here.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.860
Let's not forget
the battery operated generators

06:33.027 --> 06:34.946
and the popcorn machines.

06:35.112 --> 06:37.240
l'm open to all things cinema.

06:39.909 --> 06:41.744
They're East lndian. Bollywood.

06:42.537 --> 06:44.622
No subtitles.

06:44.789 --> 06:47.166
lt's low on the list of genres,
l know,

06:47.375 --> 06:48.876
but extremely babe-heavy.

06:49.335 --> 06:51.295
Where are the small arms?

06:51.462 --> 06:56.092
<i>l mean, why would they shoot at us
over copies of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai?</i>

06:56.259 --> 06:58.177
Does it matter?
We need to get out of here, Tony.

06:58.344 --> 07:01.013
Yeah, l heard that
the first 50 times you said it.

07:02.056 --> 07:04.058
- You're not claustrophobic, are you?
- No.

07:04.225 --> 07:07.728
Because l'm telling you, that would
be another nail in the shoe of my day.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.941
What if we blow a hole at the bottom
of this door, near where the bolt is?

07:12.900 --> 07:16.237
lt might enable us to jam something
under it and force it open.

07:16.404 --> 07:20.700
Not liking it. Firing a bullet
in the air and it's bound to ricochet.

07:24.954 --> 07:26.122
As l was saying,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.916
there's a good chance
the bullet might ricochet

07:29.083 --> 07:30.793
- and kill one of us.
- Sorry.

07:31.377 --> 07:34.922
- Why are you on top of me?
- l'm protecting you, Tony.

07:35.089 --> 07:36.757
- Don't.
- Well, you didn't seem to mind

07:36.924 --> 07:38.259
when we were undercover.

07:38.426 --> 07:42.013
That might have something to do
with the fact that you were naked.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.266
Perhaps if it were warmer in here.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.563
Let me rephrase the question.

07:51.105 --> 07:53.399
Why are you still on top of me?

07:56.319 --> 07:59.113
Our last contact with them was here,
the North Expansion.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.783
They were checking out a West African
cargo chip that pulled in two days ago.

08:02.992 --> 08:05.203
What about the GPS stuff
in their phones?

08:05.369 --> 08:07.371
Well, see, that's the strange thing.

08:07.538 --> 08:09.582
Their cell phone reception is bad
around the docks

08:09.957 --> 08:11.542
but GPS chip should not be affected.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.961
They run on a separate satellite
networks, we should be able

08:14.128 --> 08:16.589
- to pick them up anyway.
- Should, McGee?

08:16.798 --> 08:18.382
For some reason we can't.

08:20.218 --> 08:22.595
Phones-- Phones could be turned off.

08:23.304 --> 08:26.641
Chips could be disabled.
They could be in a structure

08:27.058 --> 08:29.185
that is blocking the GPS signal.

08:29.352 --> 08:32.438
- Like the hold of a ship?
- Possibly. You know,

08:32.605 --> 08:34.190
l'm thinking
that they might be waiting

08:34.357 --> 08:37.943
to get into a better cell reception area
before calling in.

08:38.486 --> 08:41.823
Maybe doesn't cut it, McGee.
You should have let me know.

08:42.448 --> 08:43.448
l know.

08:43.658 --> 08:46.536
See, the thing is you were busy,
boss. You were in the restroom.

08:46.702 --> 08:49.497
You ever had a conversation
in the head, McGee?

08:49.664 --> 08:54.043
One time l did. The person that l was
talking to were so distracted my shoes

08:54.210 --> 08:56.963
they kind of got--
Sorry, l should have let you know.

08:57.129 --> 08:59.215
Don't apologize.
lt's a sign of weakness.

09:00.716 --> 09:04.470
Let's find them before DiNozzo
blows both his arms off.

09:11.185 --> 09:12.520
This doesn't make any sense.

09:12.687 --> 09:15.314
Maybe this isn't the container
they used to smuggle their weapons.

09:15.481 --> 09:18.359
This is the only container that wasn't
sealed. The rest of them are closed.

09:18.526 --> 09:20.653
- They off-loaded them already?
- That might explain

09:20.820 --> 09:22.321
how they got automatic weapons.

09:22.488 --> 09:25.950
- We're missing something.
- Besides warmth?

09:26.784 --> 09:31.998
Ziva David, does this space
seem different to you?

09:32.206 --> 09:33.374
Define different.

09:33.541 --> 09:37.670
Does it seem smaller
than the outside dimension?

09:37.837 --> 09:44.343
Usually containers are 40 feet long.
This one's only 34 on the inside.

09:51.726 --> 09:54.061
Somebody's been doing renovations.

09:54.228 --> 09:55.313
Plywood.

10:00.651 --> 10:02.153
Not bad.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.197
- l can almost forgive you now.
- For what?

10:04.363 --> 10:07.575
- For locking us in this box.
- Ladies first.

10:10.578 --> 10:11.746
What do you see?

10:12.580 --> 10:13.581
Trouble.

10:13.789 --> 10:15.208
Arabic script.

10:15.958 --> 10:20.588
- What does it say?
- ''This end up. Handle with care.

10:21.798 --> 10:25.384
Caution: explosive ordinance.''

10:25.551 --> 10:28.429
- A bomb?
- l think so, yes.

10:28.596 --> 10:32.600
And what does this say exactly?

10:33.142 --> 10:34.393
''Death to America.''

10:36.979 --> 10:38.231
Great.

10:38.397 --> 10:40.316
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?

10:40.483 --> 10:46.489
Perhaps, if it involves
a violent and painful death.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.540
Careful.

10:55.706 --> 10:58.251
This may be booby-trapped
a dozen different ways.

10:59.001 --> 11:01.879
- So why are we opening it again?
- Because if it is a bomb,

11:02.046 --> 11:03.548
it may be armed.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.386
Hey, listen, if this thing goes off

11:08.553 --> 11:11.597
- l just want you to know--
- This is not your fault. l know.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.766
No, l was gonna say

11:15.101 --> 11:17.562
your life would have had
more meaning if you'd slept with me.

11:17.728 --> 11:20.273
lf you had anything else on your mind,
perhaps l would have.

11:20.481 --> 11:23.234
- Really?
- No.

11:23.401 --> 11:25.945
- Ready?
- Hold on.

11:34.620 --> 11:35.621
All right.

11:41.335 --> 11:42.420
Up an inch.

11:44.505 --> 11:46.340
No visible wires. Proceed.

11:49.010 --> 11:52.763
- Oh, my God.
- Well, l didn't expect to see that.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.351
There's gotta be millions in here.

11:57.518 --> 12:01.647
More than enough to bankroll
one hell of a terrorist op.

12:01.814 --> 12:08.154
These DVDs were just decoys
to get through Customs.

12:10.573 --> 12:11.991
l'll tell you what.

12:12.658 --> 12:16.829
When we get out of here,
l'm gonna buy you a house.

12:17.288 --> 12:19.373
But it's gonna have to be
a fake house

12:19.540 --> 12:21.000
because these are counterfeit.

12:21.584 --> 12:23.169
How can you tell?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.797
The Treasury ran a workshop with us.

12:25.963 --> 12:28.508
First, they're freshly printed.

12:28.674 --> 12:31.552
Your Treasury
prints millions everyday.

12:31.719 --> 12:34.263
So do countries like Syria
and North Korea.

12:34.472 --> 12:36.849
Hundred dollar bill hasn't
been redesigned since '96,

12:37.058 --> 12:39.435
which makes it very vulnerable
to this kind of counterfeit.

12:39.644 --> 12:41.896
Still, that doesn't explain
how you know they're fake.

12:42.063 --> 12:45.066
The ink. lt smells.

12:46.609 --> 12:48.569
Yes, like ink.

12:48.736 --> 12:51.739
Well, our money doesn't smell.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.616
Here.

12:53.783 --> 12:55.451
Try it.

12:56.077 --> 12:57.411
Give it a little sniff.

12:58.329 --> 13:00.248
Oh, God.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.543
That smells like stale alcohol and...

13:05.586 --> 13:07.421
...your armpit.

13:10.007 --> 13:14.178
Yeah. The point is,
it doesn't smell like ink.

13:14.762 --> 13:19.725
Now, there's only one way
to know for sure.

13:21.185 --> 13:24.272
lf it burns orange, it's real.

13:33.781 --> 13:35.032
lmpressive,

13:35.199 --> 13:38.452
but irrelevant. Real or not,
our friends are coming back for it.

13:38.619 --> 13:41.247
They may already be here.

13:41.956 --> 13:45.126
Your people
checked in with me at 7:06.

13:45.293 --> 13:47.044
DiNozzo and David, right?

13:47.211 --> 13:50.339
They were surveilling containers for
illegal contraband from West Africa.

13:50.506 --> 13:52.633
- That's them.
- Well, they're staked out by the dock

13:52.800 --> 13:54.427
- on the North Expansion.
- Not anymore.

13:54.594 --> 13:56.179
- They changed their post.
- Now this--

13:56.345 --> 13:58.806
l've got to tell you something.
l made it very clear to them

13:58.973 --> 14:02.810
that any change of plans goes through
this office. Where are they now?

14:02.977 --> 14:06.230
That would be the purpose of this visit,
Mr. Lake. We lost contact.

14:06.397 --> 14:08.774
For all we know, they're out
wandering around somewhere lost.

14:08.941 --> 14:10.610
My people don't get lost.

14:10.776 --> 14:13.779
Agent Gibbs, this is one of the
largest ports on the East Coast.

14:13.946 --> 14:16.324
Believe me, it happens all the time.
Matthew?

14:16.491 --> 14:17.658
- Sir?
- Do me a favour.

14:17.825 --> 14:18.993
We've got two missing Feds.

14:19.202 --> 14:21.746
Take your team and sweep the sectors
by the North Expansion.

14:21.913 --> 14:22.997
Call me when you find them.

14:23.164 --> 14:24.999
You're welcome to wait here
while we locate them.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.919
lt would be helpful if we could review
the security camera footage.

14:28.085 --> 14:29.670
Sure. l'll have
one of my techs work on it.

14:29.837 --> 14:31.839
Hey, what kind of contraband
were they looking for?

14:32.006 --> 14:34.759
- Arms shipment. Explosives.
- What ship?

14:34.926 --> 14:37.595
We'll have to lock it down,
and search it container by container.

14:37.762 --> 14:40.014
Our intel indicates
that it might be Senegalese.

14:40.181 --> 14:42.350
Might be?
Meaning you don't have any idea?

14:42.517 --> 14:44.101
No, not yet.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.020
Do you have any idea
how busy we are here?

14:46.187 --> 14:49.690
Right now l've got three ships
sailing under the Senegalese flag.

14:49.857 --> 14:51.984
Two more coming in on Thursday.

14:52.151 --> 14:53.694
Well, how accurate
is your intelligence?

14:55.988 --> 15:00.535
Do you guys know how many intel
BOLOs l get in one week?

15:00.701 --> 15:02.578
How many of them
turn out to be false alarms?

15:02.745 --> 15:05.456
l'm going to need more than chatter
before we disrupt the port.

15:05.623 --> 15:06.707
Yeah?

15:06.916 --> 15:08.668
Well, l need to find my people.

15:10.545 --> 15:12.463
- Abby?
- ls he always like that?

15:12.630 --> 15:13.798
Yeah, pretty much.

15:16.217 --> 15:20.054
One million, 820.

15:20.721 --> 15:22.682
- One million--
- Counting your riches, King Cole?

15:23.391 --> 15:24.725
Midas.

15:24.892 --> 15:26.894
King Cole had a merry old soul.

15:27.061 --> 15:30.815
That's 1 20 million.

15:32.233 --> 15:35.027
Thanks.
You made me lose count again.

15:35.194 --> 15:36.946
Good.

15:37.113 --> 15:38.865
Now you can put your soul
to good use.

15:39.031 --> 15:40.741
- Doing what?
- Helping me set up

15:40.908 --> 15:42.577
this defensive perimeter.

15:42.743 --> 15:46.914
Actually, l was warming to your
earlier idea of getting us out of here.

15:47.081 --> 15:49.750
- lf we burn these bills--
- We'll die of smoke inhalation, Tony.

15:49.917 --> 15:51.878
Oh, no, no, no. Look up.

15:52.044 --> 15:53.671
Heat rises, right?

15:53.838 --> 15:56.924
So the smoke is gonna go out through
these ventilation slots

15:57.091 --> 16:01.929
and draw attention to our position.
Not to mention the added benefit

16:02.096 --> 16:04.724
- of heat production.
- Are you serious?

16:04.891 --> 16:06.642
Well, it makes more sense
than firing a gun

16:06.809 --> 16:09.937
inside a metal box now, doesn't it?

16:11.439 --> 16:13.357
Don't worry about a thing.

16:13.524 --> 16:16.277
The worse thing that can happen
is it gets a little smoky in here.

16:17.612 --> 16:19.655
lt's kind of fun.

16:19.822 --> 16:22.450
lt's a little crazy, actually.

16:25.953 --> 16:28.789
- Now, that feels good.
- Okay, well, it's a little warmer.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.751
Hey, that's a lot of fire.

16:31.918 --> 16:34.962
Here we go.
Out the ventilation shaft.

16:42.261 --> 16:44.263
lt's okay. lt's okay.

16:48.059 --> 16:50.102
l can barely hear you, Gibbs.
Where are you?

16:50.269 --> 16:53.439
Norfolk Port Authority.
We're sending over surveillance--

16:53.606 --> 16:55.566
- Surveillance what?
- Videos.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.820
l want you to look at this morning's
recording of the North Expan--

16:58.986 --> 17:01.364
<i>- --and three.
- For what, exactly?</i>

17:01.531 --> 17:04.784
- Anything of Tony and Ziva.
- Tony and Ziva aren't here, Gibbs.

17:04.951 --> 17:06.618
l know that, Abby.
We're looking for them.

17:06.786 --> 17:07.787
Are they missing?

17:11.165 --> 17:14.417
Hold on, okay?
l got another call coming in.

17:15.336 --> 17:19.006
- Abby Sciuto, NClS--
- Find Tony and Ziva, Abs.

17:19.173 --> 17:21.425
The videos are on their way
to you right now.

17:21.592 --> 17:22.969
- Can l talk to McGee?
- Why?

17:23.136 --> 17:27.848
Because l need to know what codec
they use for encoding their video.

17:32.728 --> 17:34.856
- Hello?
- What happened to Tony and Ziva?

17:35.481 --> 17:37.316
Abby, it's not a really good time
right now.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.861
You'd better call me as soon
as you're Gibbs-free, McGee.

17:40.111 --> 17:42.363
<i>- l will. l will.
- Promise me.</i>

17:42.530 --> 17:44.448
Abby, l promise. Okay?

17:44.615 --> 17:46.242
Okay, transfer is complete.

17:46.409 --> 17:49.954
Copy of all of our security footage
since the time that your agents arrived.

17:50.121 --> 17:51.747
Where are those
Senegalese ships docked?

17:51.914 --> 17:54.458
Piers Five Alpha, Three Tango,
and Six Delta.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.714
- l want to see them.
- l think that means we go with him.

18:07.430 --> 18:08.890
Definitely your worst idea yet.

18:09.056 --> 18:12.226
No, my worst idea was challenging
a date to an oyster-eating contest.

18:12.393 --> 18:14.061
The air in here is like soup.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.522
Hey, do you want
to give me a hand, please?

18:16.689 --> 18:18.232
Sure.

18:18.733 --> 18:22.320
So riddle me this, Batgirl.

18:23.070 --> 18:27.200
How does one wrangle an invite
to dinner at your place?

18:27.366 --> 18:30.912
Why?
You feel a little left out, Tony?

18:31.078 --> 18:34.499
l mean, McGee l can understand.
He's a good guest.

18:34.665 --> 18:36.834
l'll bet he brought a bottle of wine.

18:37.502 --> 18:38.669
And dessert.

18:38.878 --> 18:40.880
Yeah, big surprise there.
But Palmer...

18:41.047 --> 18:44.175
l've had more stimulating
conversations with cats.

18:44.509 --> 18:48.179
l like him.
And he was very helpful to me.

18:48.346 --> 18:49.931
How?

18:50.598 --> 18:52.266
He tuned my piano.

18:56.103 --> 18:57.605
l used to play piano.

18:58.397 --> 18:59.398
But not anymore?

19:00.316 --> 19:02.777
My mother forced me to take lessons
from this woman

19:02.944 --> 19:06.948
who used to hit me with a ruler
every time l made a mistake.

19:07.615 --> 19:08.699
l haven't played since.

19:09.408 --> 19:11.202
Were you any good?

19:12.078 --> 19:13.621
Yeah, she was.

19:17.959 --> 19:21.879
l need you to re-sample
the histopathology for me.

19:24.257 --> 19:25.258
ls something wrong?

19:26.717 --> 19:28.886
- Why does he do that, Ducky?
- Who?

19:30.138 --> 19:31.597
Gibbs.

19:31.764 --> 19:33.307
Why does he withhold?

19:34.475 --> 19:36.936
He wants me to check
the Norfolk Terminal security video

19:37.145 --> 19:38.396
for Tony and Ziva.

19:38.604 --> 19:40.731
- Oh, it's probably nothing.
- Oh, no.

19:41.607 --> 19:42.608
lt's something.

19:42.817 --> 19:46.195
Gibbs can smell the rotten cabbage
in the middle of the pile.

19:46.362 --> 19:48.322
Do you think Tony and Ziva
are in trouble?

19:48.489 --> 19:50.741
l'm thinking
that's what Gibbs is thinking.

19:51.742 --> 19:54.120
Then we do have cause for concern.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.792
Very well done, darling.

19:59.959 --> 20:02.628
But where
are we going to put the divan?

20:02.795 --> 20:04.672
Actually, you know,
it looks pretty good.

20:05.214 --> 20:07.341
l particularly like your firing slots.

20:08.676 --> 20:11.929
Of course, against automatic weapons
it'll disintegrate in 30 seconds.

20:12.096 --> 20:13.473
Yeah.

20:13.639 --> 20:17.810
What is it about danger and
uncertainty that makes me feel so--

20:17.977 --> 20:19.437
Horny?

20:19.604 --> 20:23.274
Hungry. l'd kill for a pizza right now.

20:24.275 --> 20:25.735
What?

20:25.902 --> 20:27.361
You don't have to joke about it.

20:28.070 --> 20:30.114
lt's all right to admit you're scared.

20:33.701 --> 20:36.662
You've obviously never seen
a Steve McQueen movie.

20:36.829 --> 20:40.374
Why must you equate everything
in life to your stupid movies?

20:40.541 --> 20:44.754
Now, see, that's your problem.
You have no fantasy life.

20:46.214 --> 20:49.050
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Yeah. Really?

20:49.217 --> 20:53.971
Okay, well then, throw one out there.
Let's hear a Ziva David fantasy.

20:54.138 --> 20:56.891
- lt concerns you.
- l'm all ears.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.101
And a sumo wrestler.

21:00.061 --> 21:01.562
You can stop there.

21:02.438 --> 21:06.692
You see, it's all about hot women
and brave men to you.

21:06.859 --> 21:09.070
Anything deeper
and you shut it down.

21:09.237 --> 21:10.696
That's not true.

21:10.863 --> 21:12.406
l like a lot of deep movies.

21:12.573 --> 21:14.408
Pick a genre, any genre.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.160
Okay. Best dating movie.

21:16.327 --> 21:18.162
<i>Night of the Living Dead.
l'm kidding.</i>

21:18.329 --> 21:19.914
<i>Tom Jones.</i>

21:20.081 --> 21:22.250
Eating as sex.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.210
<i>- Best sex movie.
- Body Heat.</i>

21:24.377 --> 21:26.504
William Hurt, Kathleen Turner.
Smart noir.

21:26.712 --> 21:30.466
l like the whole sweaty,
chairs-through-glass-doors thing.

21:30.675 --> 21:33.511
Yeah. l prefer the air conditioner on.

21:33.678 --> 21:36.389
And if anybody threw a chair
through my door

21:36.556 --> 21:40.601
l would probably shoot them.

21:40.768 --> 21:43.604
Did you just reveal something
about your sex life?

21:43.771 --> 21:44.856
Obliquely.

21:45.022 --> 21:47.400
l'm stunned because
you never talk about yourself.

21:47.567 --> 21:48.985
Why is that?

21:49.152 --> 21:50.653
Maybe l like a little privacy.

21:50.820 --> 21:54.198
No, l understand.
But we could die here.

21:54.365 --> 21:57.368
l mean, you know,
we're in a cold metal box.

21:57.535 --> 21:59.912
So give me something.
Happiest moment?

22:00.121 --> 22:01.289
Most embarrassing moment?

22:01.455 --> 22:04.125
First time you realized
Daddy wasn't perfect.

22:13.968 --> 22:17.805
- Okay, l'll tell you mine.
- We're not sharing.

22:23.644 --> 22:26.189
We're being lifted by a forklift.

22:34.822 --> 22:36.407
See if you can
find their vehicle, McGee.

22:36.574 --> 22:38.159
On it.

22:42.079 --> 22:44.999
What time's that ship scheduled
to get underway?

22:45.166 --> 22:47.627
They're still off-loading,
so some time tomorrow afternoon.

22:47.835 --> 22:48.920
Hey, boss, l found it.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.884
lt's locked.

22:57.345 --> 22:58.930
Find them, McGee. Spread out.

23:03.351 --> 23:05.812
How many times do these containers
come and go on a given day?

23:06.020 --> 23:08.022
On this dock, thousands.

23:13.236 --> 23:14.779
You know what this is?

23:14.946 --> 23:16.322
That's a blood trail.

23:18.032 --> 23:20.868
Do you still think
this is just chatter, Lake?

23:21.619 --> 23:23.955
- Boss?
- What do you got, McGee?

23:42.181 --> 23:44.559
Now, this is where
the blood trail stops, boss.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.352
You mean starts.

23:46.519 --> 23:48.521
Yes, that's what l mean.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.606
Now, l've broken the area
into four sections.

23:51.566 --> 23:53.609
Area one, over here,

23:53.776 --> 23:55.778
is where all the action
seems to have been centred.

23:55.945 --> 23:58.739
We've recovered
three different types of brass.

23:59.907 --> 24:02.243
lt must have been
one hell of a gunfight.

24:02.410 --> 24:05.746
Yeah, well, l'll bet Tony
and Ziva thought so, McGee.

24:06.789 --> 24:07.957
They were right here.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.419
Well, we recovered the other
two types of brass from over there

24:11.627 --> 24:14.088
where the blood trail started.
Back there.

24:15.423 --> 24:19.260
- They were caught in a crossfire.
- Now look, boss. Boss.

24:19.427 --> 24:22.096
You don't--
You don't think they're--

24:23.306 --> 24:24.974
Should we put divers
in the water or--?

24:26.976 --> 24:29.020
They're not in the water.

24:29.604 --> 24:31.606
McGee, if they were in the water,
they'd be dead.

24:31.772 --> 24:33.983
lf they were dead, l'd know about it.
They're not dead.

24:36.569 --> 24:38.279
My people have been
rounding up dock workers.

24:38.446 --> 24:39.822
So far, no one's heard any gunfire.

24:39.989 --> 24:41.991
l wanna find out if there were
other containers here.

24:42.158 --> 24:44.535
Yeah, well, we're compiling a manifest
of every container

24:44.744 --> 24:47.788
off-loaded from the ship.
lf they've left the port, we'll find them.

24:47.955 --> 24:49.832
- lf not?
- Are you asking me

24:49.999 --> 24:52.919
- to search every container still in port?
- No, l'm ordering you.

24:53.085 --> 24:54.837
Make it happen, McGee.

24:59.967 --> 25:02.345
They shot him three times.

25:02.512 --> 25:04.013
At least they got one of them, Duck.

25:04.180 --> 25:07.475
Can l ask where they are?

25:08.893 --> 25:13.105
- Not if you're expecting an answer.
- What does your gut tell you?

25:14.065 --> 25:17.485
- Tell me about this guy.
- Twenty-five to 35 years old.

25:17.693 --> 25:20.571
Mortally wounded.
He was able to run about 50 yards

25:20.738 --> 25:23.616
before a massive loss of blood
brought him down.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.160
And someone dragged him in here.

25:26.327 --> 25:29.121
- Foreign born.
- You got his l.D.?

25:29.288 --> 25:30.706
No dental work.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.335
No caps or crowns.

25:34.502 --> 25:36.546
The work is primitive.

25:36.712 --> 25:39.382
And l thought England was bad.

25:40.174 --> 25:41.425
Third world?

25:41.634 --> 25:45.012
l should say so. Oh, something else
you may be interested in.

25:45.179 --> 25:47.849
His hands are soft.
No discernible calluses.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.227
He's not a dock worker.

25:51.394 --> 25:54.397
Well, l'll know more
when l get him back.

25:54.564 --> 25:56.774
You'll find them, Jethro.

25:56.983 --> 25:58.818
A question or statement, Duck?

25:59.902 --> 26:02.280
More of a prayer.

26:05.575 --> 26:08.119
Under normal circumstances,
this would be considered fun.

26:08.286 --> 26:10.913
Yeah, well, l can't tell
where we're going.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.082
There's only three ways
we're gonna get there.

26:13.249 --> 26:14.625
- Train--
- That's quaint.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.253
We could be like the homos
in those old movies.

26:17.420 --> 26:20.131
''Hobos,'' not homos.

26:20.298 --> 26:21.757
That would be my third choice.

26:21.924 --> 26:23.968
- A ship?
- That was my second choice.

26:24.135 --> 26:25.595
Days without food or water.

26:32.810 --> 26:34.979
- Sounds like a truck.
- That's my first choice.

26:35.146 --> 26:39.942
- Hey, let us out of here.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

26:40.610 --> 26:42.361
- Stop.
- What? Okay.

26:42.528 --> 26:44.906
lf l fire a shot out of here,
they'd know that we were in here.

26:45.072 --> 26:47.033
That's not a good idea.
lt's not a good idea.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.160
- Okay.
- You're assuming whoever's driving

26:49.327 --> 26:50.328
doesn't know we're here.

26:50.536 --> 26:52.538
lf they do, they can't leave the port
with us aboard.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.082
They'll take us back inside
and they'll deal with us first.

26:55.291 --> 26:56.709
Right.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.253
Right. Okay, l have a plan.

27:00.129 --> 27:01.881
We build a time machine.

27:02.048 --> 27:03.466
We could leave a trail.

27:03.633 --> 27:06.093
Sorry, Gretel, l left all
my breadcrumbs back at the office.

27:06.302 --> 27:09.472
Well, then, it's a good thing
we've got all this dough.

27:13.226 --> 27:15.269
l'm starting to get
really freaked out here, Gibbs.

27:15.436 --> 27:18.648
l found Tony and Ziva on the port video
but l don't think it's enough.

27:18.815 --> 27:21.901
- lt's all right, Abs.
- l just feel like l'm failing them and l--

27:22.068 --> 27:24.070
Just take us through it.
Start with pier three.

27:24.237 --> 27:26.155
<i>Okay.
Are you getting this too, McGee?</i>

27:26.322 --> 27:27.990
Yep. Transmission is good.

27:28.157 --> 27:29.325
All right.

27:29.492 --> 27:31.953
Their car pulled up at 7:57.

27:32.161 --> 27:33.621
They got out,

27:34.539 --> 27:37.208
and then they leave two minutes
and 32 seconds later.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.001
Anyone else in the car?

27:42.421 --> 27:43.589
No.

27:43.798 --> 27:45.675
<i>Take me to the other location, Abby.</i>

28:12.201 --> 28:14.036
Okay.

28:14.203 --> 28:17.957
You stick with that. l'm going to see
if the reception is any better.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.502
Nothing.

28:21.669 --> 28:23.671
What we need is a better antenna.

28:23.838 --> 28:27.592
Any kind of wire would work.
Any kind of conductor, really.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.677
Hey. Your necklace.

28:29.844 --> 28:33.139
We can attach it to the end of the
antenna and slip it out of the slot.

28:33.306 --> 28:36.476
Cell phone antennas are vertical.
The wire can't dangle.

28:37.810 --> 28:39.770
Well, we need to stiffen it, Ziva.

28:39.937 --> 28:41.022
l've heard that before.

28:41.731 --> 28:43.941
Work with me here.

28:44.150 --> 28:50.114
We can slice the spines off these
DVDs and sandwich it in between.

28:51.741 --> 28:53.242
- You okay?
- Yes.

28:53.409 --> 28:56.621
- l still need something to reflect off.
- The side of the container.

28:56.787 --> 28:58.414
The angle needs to be precise, Tony.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.751
The response l'm looking for here is,
''Cool, Tony!''

29:02.376 --> 29:03.753
l'm saying it might work.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.881
<i>When this is all over, we're gonna
watch Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.</i>

29:08.090 --> 29:09.926
This is where it gets disturbing.

29:10.092 --> 29:12.220
<i>lt's like looking at an Escher print.</i>

29:12.386 --> 29:14.722
<i>l was able to isolate four segments.</i>

29:14.889 --> 29:18.309
At 8:1 6 l have them getting out
of the North Expansion sector.

29:18.518 --> 29:20.895
Then at this point
they walk out of frame.

29:21.103 --> 29:23.773
Another camera
picked them up at 8:1 9.

29:23.940 --> 29:25.358
You see them here...

29:26.943 --> 29:30.071
<i>...and then here.
And they have their guns drawn.</i>

29:30.238 --> 29:32.907
<i>The problem is, there's another
container blocking the camera.</i>

29:33.074 --> 29:35.868
Now, look at the bottom left corner
of your screen.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.414
Boss, that's our dead guy.

29:40.957 --> 29:43.501
l ran his photo
and l got a positive lD, Gibbs.

29:43.751 --> 29:46.295
lnterpol identified him
as Moussa Senghor,

29:46.504 --> 29:49.465
a Senegalese citizen. He's on
the international terrorist watch list.

29:49.632 --> 29:53.636
Boss, Moussa Senghor
has ties to Wilson N'Diaye.

29:53.803 --> 29:55.805
- He's--
- Al-Qaeda money man.

29:55.972 --> 29:58.432
Financed the attack
on four Bali night clubs last year.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.770
<i>- lt's a good job, Abby.
- The bad news is he wasn't alone.</i>

30:06.399 --> 30:08.943
<i>- There's no lD on him yet.
- What else you got, Abs?</i>

30:09.735 --> 30:11.571
Just this.

30:12.864 --> 30:14.282
They shot the camera.

30:14.448 --> 30:17.952
Abby, can you rewind it
and pull back to the wide angle?

30:19.412 --> 30:20.496
<i>Can you freeze it there?</i>

30:21.164 --> 30:23.124
Boss, l think l know what happened.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.334
These are the crime scene photos
from the dock.

30:25.501 --> 30:27.587
And this is from
the security camera taken earlier.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.797
The container by Ziva is missing.

30:29.964 --> 30:32.842
- lf they were in a crossfire--
- They took cover inside.

30:34.010 --> 30:37.763
Abby, put another CAFF-POW
on my tab.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.265
Just one, Gibbs?

30:40.641 --> 30:41.976
You haven't found them yet.

30:45.104 --> 30:48.274
- How's it coming?
- My fingers aren't working.

30:48.441 --> 30:50.276
Do you want me to do it?

30:50.443 --> 30:53.529
l've got it. Just give me one
of your little hair squinchie things.

30:53.696 --> 30:55.364
The term is ''scrunchie.''

30:57.074 --> 30:59.327
Thank you.
Now l've just got to figure out

30:59.494 --> 31:01.496
how to attach this thing
to the cell phone.

31:01.662 --> 31:04.707
We may not need to.
We now have

31:04.874 --> 31:08.628
several hundred thousand
dollars out there floating around.

31:08.795 --> 31:10.546
lt's a matter of time
before they find us.

31:21.390 --> 31:23.935
The symbol's from the company
that uses this type of container.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.145
l tell you, the problem is
without a tracking number,

31:26.312 --> 31:28.231
- l can't tell you where this one went.
- McGee.

31:28.731 --> 31:30.775
We've got six teams
covering the gates out on the port.

31:30.942 --> 31:32.819
They're intercepting containers
with the markings.

31:32.985 --> 31:35.696
- What about the ones still in port?
- Used by this same company?

31:37.240 --> 31:39.784
Approximately 862.

31:39.992 --> 31:42.662
- l only need one.
- They're spread all over the complex.

31:42.829 --> 31:45.289
- lt would take days to search them all.
- We won't have to.

31:45.498 --> 31:47.959
- How much does one weigh?
- l don't know. About five tons.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.086
l can't imagine they're easy to move.

31:50.253 --> 31:51.754
No, of course not.
There's only two ways.

31:51.921 --> 31:53.756
A crane or a top-loader forklift.

31:53.923 --> 31:55.883
No, there's no crane
in range of the crime scene.

31:56.050 --> 31:58.511
lt had to be moved by a top-loader
and we only have 1 0 of those

31:58.719 --> 32:01.430
with maybe 20 qualified operators
to drive them.

32:01.597 --> 32:04.600
Kristen. Get me a list of the top-loading
forklifts that operated

32:04.767 --> 32:07.770
in the North East Expansion today.
Plus, l want names of all the drivers.

32:07.937 --> 32:09.438
- Right away.
- We find that forklift--

32:09.605 --> 32:10.690
We find who moved it.

32:18.781 --> 32:21.325
We're backing up. Almost done?

32:21.534 --> 32:24.078
l just got to figure out
how to attach it.

32:25.621 --> 32:27.623
l may be able to help you with that.

32:29.917 --> 32:31.461
What?

32:31.627 --> 32:34.464
- Friction burns?
- Yeah, what difference does it make?

32:34.630 --> 32:36.466
lt doesn't.
l'm just wondering how you got them.

32:36.632 --> 32:39.469
Well, if you live long enough,
maybe l'll tell you some day.

32:39.635 --> 32:42.096
You know,
l can only take it two ways.

32:42.263 --> 32:44.265
Were you, McGee and Palmer
playing Twister last night?

32:44.432 --> 32:45.600
What's a Twister?

32:45.808 --> 32:47.727
Exactly.
That means you were having--

32:59.322 --> 33:02.742
lf you're gonna make that phone call,
now is the right time to do it.

33:12.126 --> 33:13.586
The grooves match.

33:14.754 --> 33:17.590
All three rounds that you pulled out
of toothless downstairs

33:17.757 --> 33:18.758
came from Tony's weapon,

33:18.966 --> 33:21.636
and none of the blood samples
taken from the dock

33:21.803 --> 33:23.471
match Tony or Ziva's blood type.

33:23.638 --> 33:24.972
l think they're going to be okay.

33:25.139 --> 33:29.060
Tony is only one
of our very best agents and Ziva,

33:29.227 --> 33:33.147
she's basically a trained killer, right?
l mean, she could take care of herself.

33:33.314 --> 33:37.777
And l got a direct link
to four different GPS satellites.

33:37.944 --> 33:40.655
Either of them get an area
with reception again, bam.

33:41.656 --> 33:46.369
We got them. l really don't think that
there's any reason to worry, Ducky.

33:46.536 --> 33:48.371
They're gonna be fine.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.669
l need you to tell me
they're going to be okay.

33:55.545 --> 33:57.505
Of course they are.

33:59.006 --> 34:01.175
l want every building swept,
room to room.

34:01.342 --> 34:02.760
Start with the vacant ones first.

34:02.927 --> 34:04.387
Cell reception's unreliable in the area

34:04.554 --> 34:06.514
so all movement
will be coordinated by radio.

34:06.681 --> 34:08.516
Tactical frequency is two,
admin is four.

34:08.683 --> 34:10.184
- Go. Go. Find them.
- Hey, Gibbs.

34:10.351 --> 34:13.312
l only have two top-loaders working
in the Northern Expansion today.

34:13.478 --> 34:15.857
One here in pier seven
off-loading a ship

34:16.023 --> 34:18.317
and the other one
is at an auxiliary warehouse.

34:18.484 --> 34:20.570
Now, the drivers
should still be with the rigs.

34:20.735 --> 34:23.864
- l'll send some of my people--
- No, we got it. Let's roll, McGee.

34:26.449 --> 34:28.703
- You understand that gibberish?
- A little.

34:29.454 --> 34:30.455
What's he saying?

34:30.663 --> 34:33.748
They're either discussing letting us go
or the best way to murder us.

34:36.043 --> 34:37.210
lt's a complicated language.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.089
- Well, l'd go with number two.
- Me too.

34:40.255 --> 34:43.050
- Get any reception?
- Negative.

34:43.217 --> 34:46.387
l'm gonna have to stick this antenna
out one of the ventilation slots.

34:48.097 --> 34:51.766
lf you want to live you will
come out of the container now.

34:51.976 --> 34:54.061
What was that? Speak up.

34:59.150 --> 35:01.861
l said, come out now, woman.

35:02.862 --> 35:07.617
Come out now or we will come in.

35:09.786 --> 35:11.037
What is your answer?

35:12.455 --> 35:13.706
This.

35:18.294 --> 35:20.129
She shot me.

35:20.671 --> 35:22.590
She shot me!

35:23.633 --> 35:26.093
Make your call. We only have
a couple of minutes now.

35:31.966 --> 35:35.470
Okay, l think we turn up here,
past this next row of warehouses.

35:35.637 --> 35:36.804
You think, McGee?

35:36.971 --> 35:40.016
Well, boss,
maybe if you slowed down a little l'd--

35:42.227 --> 35:44.062
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Boss, it's me.</i>

35:44.229 --> 35:45.313
<i>- Tony.
- Yeah.</i>

35:46.856 --> 35:49.567
Boss, it's a long story,
but the really short version is

35:49.734 --> 35:52.403
that we're trapped in a container
with millions in phoney U.S. bills

35:52.570 --> 35:55.281
- in some port building.
- You're coming in broken, DiNozzo.

35:55.448 --> 35:56.449
Say again.

35:56.658 --> 35:58.368
<i>lf you can hear me,
we left a trail of money.</i>

35:58.535 --> 36:00.328
<i>- Money?
- Follow the money.</i>

36:01.204 --> 36:02.831
<i>- Phone Abby.
- Tony, get down.</i>

36:02.997 --> 36:05.124
- They're coming again.
- DiNozzo.

36:05.291 --> 36:08.586
Keep the damn phone on.
Abby will find you.

36:08.753 --> 36:10.588
<i>You can look for it.
We're out of time. Hurry.</i>

36:10.755 --> 36:12.882
<i>- We're low on ammo--
- Tony.</i>

36:13.049 --> 36:14.509
Damn it.

36:14.676 --> 36:17.345
See if you can get him back
on that thing.

36:23.726 --> 36:26.688
l knew it, Ducky.
l knew they were alive.

36:26.855 --> 36:31.401
Okay. l just need a second
and l'll be able-- No, no, no!

36:31.568 --> 36:34.195
- What's wrong?
- l lost him again.

36:34.362 --> 36:38.366
- But there they are. On the map.
- No, that's just a general fix.

36:38.533 --> 36:41.870
Means they're somewhere
within a 500-metre radius.

36:42.036 --> 36:44.789
- lf l had one more second l could've--
- Five-hundred metres

36:44.956 --> 36:48.626
is better than we were a moment ago.
You'd better tell Gibbs.

37:19.866 --> 37:22.160
l can't get through
to Gibbs or McGee.

37:22.327 --> 37:26.080
Did you try them
through the port security office?

37:26.247 --> 37:29.834
l was just about to do that.

37:32.253 --> 37:33.254
Port security.

37:33.463 --> 37:36.591
l need to speak to Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs, please.

37:36.758 --> 37:38.760
He's not here right now.
lf you want, l can

37:38.927 --> 37:40.512
pass the message to him
over the radio.

37:40.678 --> 37:43.056
We've got a GPS fix
on our missing NClS agents.

37:43.223 --> 37:46.893
Hold on. Hey.
They got a fix on the missing Feds.

37:47.101 --> 37:49.896
<i>- What are the coordinates?
- They're on the south side,</i>

37:50.063 --> 37:54.609
within a 500-metre radius
of warehouses one through four.

37:54.776 --> 37:55.860
Okay. Hey, thanks.

38:05.328 --> 38:07.288
l'm down to four rounds. You?

38:07.455 --> 38:10.250
- Six, but it doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

38:12.669 --> 38:14.796
Because a few more bursts like that
and we're dead.

38:15.338 --> 38:17.090
l've got an idea.

38:18.174 --> 38:19.968
How come that doesn't comfort me?

38:21.261 --> 38:22.762
We found your money.

38:22.929 --> 38:24.806
Cease fire or we start burning it.

38:27.475 --> 38:29.435
He's bluffing.

38:34.148 --> 38:37.819
Stop! Stop!
What are you proposing?

38:37.986 --> 38:39.320
Surrender.

38:41.656 --> 38:43.366
Then throw out your weapons.

38:43.533 --> 38:45.827
- Not us, you idiot.
- No!

38:46.828 --> 38:48.079
l think not.

38:48.288 --> 38:50.331
There's $50 million in there.

38:50.957 --> 38:53.168
You'll be dead
before you can burn half of it.

38:53.334 --> 38:55.420
He's got a valid point.

38:55.587 --> 38:58.298
We just have to stall long enough
for Gibbs to find us.

39:00.091 --> 39:04.220
l just need to talk to my partner
about that for a second.

39:07.682 --> 39:09.517
That's a solid copy.
We're heading that way now.

39:09.684 --> 39:11.477
Those warehouses
are about two clicks from here.

39:11.644 --> 39:13.229
We make a left
past these loading docks.

39:15.732 --> 39:17.859
- Did you see that?
- That guy back there?

39:19.319 --> 39:22.155
Yeah, McGee.
The one stuffing money in his pockets.

39:28.411 --> 39:30.371
- NClS.
- l didn't steal it. l swear.

39:30.538 --> 39:32.373
l found it.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.626
Where?

39:36.419 --> 39:38.421
There was a container truck.

39:38.588 --> 39:40.798
lt had money
just floating out the back.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.550
Which way?

39:44.093 --> 39:46.221
Which way?

39:47.222 --> 39:48.765
lt went that way.

39:49.599 --> 39:51.726
- Let's go.
- Boss, that's the wrong direction.

39:51.893 --> 39:54.103
- According to the GPS fix--
- Not according to DiNozzo.

39:54.270 --> 39:56.189
He said follow the money.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.040
l'm empty.

40:14.207 --> 40:15.625
This is your last chance.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.002
Come out or you die.

40:18.169 --> 40:19.754
So about those friction burns?

40:20.421 --> 40:23.091
Only when l'm absolutely positive
we're going to die.

40:23.466 --> 40:25.927
Okay. l've got two minutes.

40:27.303 --> 40:28.555
And Tony?

40:29.222 --> 40:31.099
l'm sorry l didn't invite you
to dinner last night.

40:31.266 --> 40:33.977
- What is your decision?
- Freeze. Port security.

40:34.143 --> 40:35.895
Get your hands in the air.
Get on your knees.

40:36.062 --> 40:39.107
- Do it! Agent DiNozzo. Agent David.
- Lake?

40:39.274 --> 40:42.068
You two had a lot of people worried,
let me tell you.

40:43.153 --> 40:45.613
- Where's Gibbs?
- He's on his way.

40:45.780 --> 40:46.948
Hey, do me a favour.

40:47.115 --> 40:49.200
Cover them
while l radio for some help.

40:49.367 --> 40:51.286
We're out of ammo.

40:51.452 --> 40:54.622
Gee, that's too bad.
Come on, Wilson. Get up.

40:54.789 --> 40:57.417
Get the money.
Get it into the van. Quickly.

40:57.584 --> 40:59.794
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry up.

41:00.336 --> 41:03.089
When this is over,
the woman is mine.

41:03.256 --> 41:05.383
We'll see, Wilson.
l'll be perfectly honest with you,

41:05.592 --> 41:07.302
l don't know
if they're gonna be alive then.

41:07.468 --> 41:09.929
You know, you two
almost cost me $50 million.

41:10.138 --> 41:12.432
Actually, by now
it's more like 1 0 or 1 2.

41:13.183 --> 41:14.767
We burned some of it.

41:15.310 --> 41:19.063
- Do you think this is funny?
- Not me, personally.

41:19.230 --> 41:22.025
But l do. Drop it.

41:23.193 --> 41:24.277
Hey, what are you doing--?

41:25.653 --> 41:27.489
- You two okay?
- Let us out!

41:27.655 --> 41:29.240
No.

41:30.450 --> 41:31.451
Oh, God.

41:31.659 --> 41:34.662
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me.

41:34.829 --> 41:38.416
- Where are you going?
- l've been locked in a box all day.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.543
The ladies' room.

41:41.669 --> 41:44.130
You missed a little spot
by my left ear there.

41:44.339 --> 41:47.091
l'd do it myself,
but my wound here prevents it.

41:47.258 --> 41:49.010
Yeah, wound.

41:49.177 --> 41:52.096
- lt's a two-inch scratch.
- l was grazed by a bullet.

41:52.263 --> 41:55.934
Another six inches to the left
and bam! No more DiNozzo.

41:56.142 --> 41:57.602
Under the chin too.

41:57.769 --> 41:59.812
You know what? l'm done.
Do it yourself.

42:00.146 --> 42:01.147
Fine.

42:01.356 --> 42:04.025
Just don't come to me looking for
sympathy the next time you get shot.

42:04.192 --> 42:07.153
Okay, you did not get shot.
l talked to Ziva.

42:07.320 --> 42:10.114
- You cut it on a wooden box.
- Hey.

42:10.281 --> 42:12.992
There was a lot going on
in that container.

42:13.159 --> 42:14.953
Nobody's exactly sure
what happened.

42:15.119 --> 42:18.373
All l know is l was running
for my life in a hail of gunfire.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.333
Tony.

42:21.084 --> 42:23.378
l was so worried about you.

42:23.586 --> 42:24.921
Oh, my God, are you okay?

42:25.463 --> 42:27.048
Gunshot.

42:28.258 --> 42:29.634
McGee.

42:29.801 --> 42:32.178
- Why didn't you tell me?
- lt's barely a scratch.

42:33.012 --> 42:34.389
Oh, poor baby.

42:36.683 --> 42:39.394
- Who's gonna drive you home?
- l am.

42:39.561 --> 42:41.563
l'm making him dinner tonight.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.572
- What was that for?
- l'm glad you're not dead.

42:51.072 --> 42:53.199
- Me too.
- So, what are you making him?

42:53.366 --> 42:55.243
- ltalian.
- You cook ltalian?

42:55.410 --> 42:57.412
Her cooking rocks, Tony.

42:57.579 --> 43:00.248
What was the name of that dish
you made last night at your party?

43:00.415 --> 43:04.252
Cholent. Slow-cooked beef
with potatoes and beans.

43:04.460 --> 43:06.254
lt wasn't bad.
