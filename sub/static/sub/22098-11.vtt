00:20.938 --> 00:23.898
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.900
MAN: This is
the Battlestar Pegasus

00:25.984 --> 00:27.944
to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.028
Please respond.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.947
Pegasus?
How could that be?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.740
The entire fleet
was destroyed.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.203
Adm. Cain.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.415
On behalf of the officers
and the crew of the Pegasus,

00:40.624 --> 00:43.042
welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.129
The Cylon fleet is composed
of two base ships,

00:46.213 --> 00:47.922
about a dozen or so
support ships

00:48.006 --> 00:52.635
and one large vessel that we
are still unable to identify.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.638
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.099
I'm going to
integrate the crews.

00:58.183 --> 01:02.186
I thought you said you had no
desire to interfere with my command.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.066
I'm Laird,
Pegasus Deck Chief.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.110
You're an
aeronautical engineer?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.278
Yeah, I was.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.196
So you're really a civilian?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.825
I was on the Scylla, and we
got picked up by the Pegasus.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.952
Things happen.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.912
How much time do I have?

01:19.997 --> 01:22.331
Weeks, a month at the outside.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.587
Will I be able to work?

01:28.046 --> 01:30.298
Unless the cancer goes to your
brain. If that happens, you...

01:31.800 --> 01:34.093
CAIN: We have
our own Cylon prisoner.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.263
NO. 6: She's obviously been
abused. Tortured.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.931
Will you help her, Gaius?

01:40.017 --> 01:41.893
You really want to get close,

01:41.977 --> 01:43.186
you got to use
the stealth ship

01:43.270 --> 01:44.979
we constructed
aboard Galactica.

01:45.063 --> 01:48.691
APOLLO: Carbon composite? It's gonna
be hard as hell to see on dradis.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.444
Starbuck,
you're off this mission.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.404
A surveillance package?

01:53.489 --> 01:54.530
Go get the Blackbird.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.033
Take some pretty pictures
of our Cylon ship.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.534
Who the hell's this Thorne?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.952
GAGE: Lt. Thorne, sir.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.954
Your little robot girl's
in for quite a ride.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.875
TYROL: Get off her!

02:09.004 --> 02:11.547
...either of you
frakking move! Don't move!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.510
They've been found guilty
on all counts.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.845
She's going to execute them
both for murder and treason.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.473
Galactica is launching Vipers
and a Raptor.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.725
Why are you launching Vipers?

02:25.062 --> 02:27.438
I'm getting my men.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.982
Launch the alert Vipers.

02:54.258 --> 02:58.094
KAT: Galactica, Kat. I've got inbound
Pegasus Vipers coming right at me.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.512
Request instructions.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.014
We've gotta let 'em
defend themselves.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.102
We should turn our main
batteries on Pegasus.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.814
(CLICKING)

04:30.228 --> 04:31.812
(ALARM BLARING)

04:31.897 --> 04:34.065
KAT: Galactica, Kat.
Request weapons free.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.900
We need your help.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.862
DUALLA: Kat, Galactica.
Do not fire unless fired upon.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.657
I repeat,
do not fire unless fired upon.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.497
Galactica, Kat. They're really
frakking with us out here!

04:49.581 --> 04:51.457
HOTDOG: Galactica, Hotdog.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.250
One of them just pulled
into my kill slot.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.294
HOTDOG: Got him in range.
Locking on.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.922
Galactica, standing by...

04:58.006 --> 04:58.965
(GRUNTING)

04:59.049 --> 05:00.675
PILOT 1: Hotdog, watch
yourself, he's right behind you!

05:00.759 --> 05:04.053
HOTDOG: Evasive action,
come on! Frakking frakkers!

05:06.556 --> 05:09.725
Okay. You're gonna have
to break your course now.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.603
HOSHI: Narcho, Pegasus.
Do not fire first.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.819
HOSHI: Stinger, Pegasus. You are
ordered to relieve Capt. Adama of duty

05:19.903 --> 05:22.363
and aid in the attack mission
on Galactica.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.535
STINGER: Your weapon, Captain.
You're relieved.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.121
HOSHI: Rock Star,
this is Pegasus.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.415
What's your call position?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.962
PILOT 2:... around your wing.
Come around, come around!

05:39.006 --> 05:41.257
Permission to go aft.
Granted.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.640
KAT: This one attempted to shoot
at me. He's right on top of me!

05:49.725 --> 05:52.268
HOSHI: Break away! Break away!
You're too close!

05:56.106 --> 05:57.523
Come on, break.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.533
Frak me! They're all over us!

06:07.617 --> 06:09.952
Galactica,
request weapons free.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.912
KAT: They're coming around
for another pass.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.123
Repeat, request weapons free!

06:22.632 --> 06:24.300
Come on, Starbuck.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.969
Tell me
you're out there somewhere.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.061
(WHISPERING)
What the hell is...

06:35.145 --> 06:36.437
(BEEPING)

06:45.906 --> 06:48.240
STARBUCK: Starbuck here.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.410
What the hell is going on?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.661
HOTDOG:
Warning! Watch your back!

06:52.746 --> 06:53.913
GAETA: Dradis contact!

06:53.997 --> 06:55.998
A single bogey
and it's nearly on top of us!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.124
Identify.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.043
No transponders,
no recognition codes,

06:59.127 --> 07:01.170
it has to be
a Cylon Raider, sir.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.547
Admiral, sir,
she's gotta be a Raider.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.801
Well, how the frak did it get in
so close without being detected?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.261
I don't know, sir. I assure
you it came out of nowhere.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.056
PILOT 3: Pegasus,
request vertical cross.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.516
Right.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.643
PILOT 4: They're just everywhere,
Captain. They're coming up close!

07:15.727 --> 07:18.479
Recall the Vipers,
bring the ship about

07:20.690 --> 07:22.399
and prepare
to engage the enemy.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.903
HOSHI: All Pegasus Vipers, all
Pegasus Vipers, emergency recall.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.197
There's a Cylon Raider
right on top of you.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.283
DUALLA: Attention, all Galactica
Vipers, you got a Cylon Raider

07:31.368 --> 07:32.493
coming right at you.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.412
There you are, you bastard.
On my lead!

07:35.497 --> 07:38.040
Break right, full power,
X- axis climb!

07:46.133 --> 07:48.884
Starbuck to all Vipers,
do not fire.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.345
Repeat, do not fire.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.472
I'm a friendly, okay?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.391
We're all friendlies,

07:55.767 --> 07:58.227
so let's just be friendly.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.731
That's no Raider, that's that
stealth ship of yours.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.067
It was flying and it wasn't
cleared to launch.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.655
You got me. I'm just
a passenger back here.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.160
Galactica, Kat.
It's the Blackbird, Galactica.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.579
KAT: Repeat,
it's the Blackbird.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.497
What the hell is the
Blackbird doing out there?

08:18.582 --> 08:19.665
HOTDOG:
All pilots hold fire.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.334
It's Starbuck. She launched in
the Blackbird a couple hours ago,

08:22.419 --> 08:24.712
said she was running
flight tests for Adm. Cain.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.463
That doesn't sound likely.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.175
Another one of her
crazy-assed stunts.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.509
Thank the gods!

08:30.594 --> 08:33.262
You can say that again.
Get me Pegasus.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.686
This is Pegasus Actual,
go ahead.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.857
We can either stand-down or we
could start shooting at each other.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.692
It's your call.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.776
Admiral.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.363
Wait one.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.661
We're receiving a download,
Admiral.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.458
That is the Cylon fleet.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.002
Are these from our
recon mission?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.713
No, sir. The recon mission
was aborted.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.131
These are from Blackbird.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.260
Thrace.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.306
She took off and did the
whole recon mission alone.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.143
My gods,
look at these shots, Jack.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.856
She put her nose right up their
backsides, and they never even knew it.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.442
Admiral, I still have
Commander Adama on the line,

09:28.526 --> 09:31.070
and our fighters are still
requesting instructions.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.655
Should they resume the attack?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.294
All right. Joint recall.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.006
Both ships stand-down
to Condition Two.

09:51.341 --> 09:54.551
Then I want you to report
to me directly. In person.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.972
I have no intention of
cooling my heels in your brig.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.726
Fine.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.563
Neutral ground.
Colonial One, no aides.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.024
Be there in 15 minutes.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.696
Stand-down, Condition Two.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.584
There you are.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.731
ROSLIN: Let's start this
by admitting an ugly truth.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.318
What happened out there today was
the result of failure in leadership

11:34.402 --> 11:36.403
of everyone in this room.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.614
We are the leaders
of this fleet.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.866
As such, we need
to set an example.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.577
We cannot continue to let
the conflicts between us...

11:43.661 --> 11:46.538
Oh, let's cut through
the hand-holding, shall we?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.500
Two of his men murdered
one of my officers

11:49.584 --> 11:51.585
while protecting a Cylon.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.670
They're guilty.
They admitted it.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.174
And under regulations
I have complete authority

11:57.258 --> 11:59.009
to try, convict
and sentence them.

12:00.136 --> 12:04.098
And you and I both know that the
penalty for that crime is death.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.435
Admiral, surely
the spirit of the law

12:08.520 --> 12:11.897
requires something more here
than summary executions.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.822
Is this what the two of you have
been doing for the past six months?

12:20.615 --> 12:24.368
Debating the finer points of
Colonial law? Well, guess what?

12:24.452 --> 12:26.120
We're at war.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.791
And we don't have the luxury of
academic debate over these issues.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.210
You want to cut through it,
fine.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.632
You have Pegasus,
he has Galactica.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.428
Two heavily armed,
very powerful warships.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.639
Now, I am sure that Pegasus
would prevail in any fight.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.683
I wouldn't count on that.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.813
ROSLIN: But certainly
there'd be heavy damage,

12:52.897 --> 12:55.482
and you'd take
significant casualties.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.111
So you can go out there and
fight it out with Galactica,

12:59.195 --> 13:00.988
or you can compromise.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.908
And those are the only two
options on the table, period.

13:10.331 --> 13:14.126
How the two of you have survived
this long, I will never know.

13:16.379 --> 13:20.757
All right. Lt. Thrace has sent
me detailed recon information

13:20.842 --> 13:23.302
on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.346
And I need Galactica to get it.
So I'm willing to go this far.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.267
I'll suspend the executions
until after the attack.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.102
I want them back on Galactica.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.480
I don't give a damn
what you want.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.441
You're frakking lucky you're
not staring at your own warrant.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.415
The destruction of the Cylon
fleet will take priority

13:53.500 --> 13:55.667
over all other considerations.

13:55.752 --> 13:59.671
After that, we will meet back here
and we will resolve this issue.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.964
Thank you.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.288
Stand at ease, Lieutenant,
and come forward.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.966
It seems you've had
quite a day.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.885
I'm promoting you to Captain.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.887
I'm making you Commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.224
You're promoting me?

14:53.601 --> 14:56.019
I need a CAG with guts
and initiative

14:56.104 --> 14:57.980
to plan and lead
the attack on this fleet.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.567
Now, I thought
Stinger was that man,

15:01.651 --> 15:03.735
but he managed to let
Capt. Adama contact you

15:03.820 --> 15:05.946
and pull off that fly-by stunt
right under his nose,

15:06.030 --> 15:07.489
so he's out.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.659
And Capt. Adama, sir?

15:12.787 --> 15:16.498
Truth be told, I came this close
to throwing him in the brig,

15:17.375 --> 15:19.418
but I couldn't exactly
charge him and not you,

15:19.502 --> 15:22.170
so I've just revoked
his flight status.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.843
I want him on my team, sir.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.690
And do you always
get what you want?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.028
Most of the time, sir.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.071
Good.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.366
Me, too.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.332
All right, you can have him.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.586
I hear you want to return
to Caprica.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.379
Yes, sir.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.466
We have people
back there still alive.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.344
Yes, and they deserve to be
saved. I absolutely agree.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.888
In fact, I will go
one step further

16:13.348 --> 16:16.058
and I will say
that our ultimate goal

16:18.394 --> 16:20.020
is that we should return
to the 12 Colonies

16:20.104 --> 16:22.230
and kick the Cylons
the frak out of our homes.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.735
What do you think
of that, Captain?

16:27.737 --> 16:31.073
I think that's the best idea
I've heard all day, sir.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.955
I'm afraid this can only
end one way.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.126
You've gotta kill her.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.718
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:51.803 --> 16:54.179
Like she said,
let's cut through it.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.098
The two of you

16:56.182 --> 16:57.849
were willing to go
to war today.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.268
Do you think she's going
to step down from that?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.937
She's gonna bide her time

17:02.730 --> 17:05.107
and hit you the first chance
she gets. That's a given.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.612
I hate to lay this on you,
Bill, but she is dangerous,

17:10.697 --> 17:13.949
and the only thing that you can do
is to hit her before she hits you.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.120
I'm not an assassin.

17:20.915 --> 17:21.957
No.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.545
You're not an assassin.
You are a Colonial officer

17:26.629 --> 17:29.548
who has taken an oath
to protect this fleet.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.010
What do you think that she is
going to do with the civilian fleet

17:34.095 --> 17:35.846
once she has eliminated you?

17:39.475 --> 17:40.684
You know I'm right.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.937
You just don't wanna face it.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.451
Has the whole world gone mad?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.630
COTTLE: Your fluid and
electrolyte levels are stable.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.216
I think the baby's
gonna be fine.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.844
You do have a cracked rib,
though,

18:15.928 --> 18:20.182
a hairline fracture, which means
it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.020
But I'm not seeing any signs of
permanent damage from the attack.

18:30.193 --> 18:33.445
The attack. Is that what
we're calling it now?

18:33.988 --> 18:35.697
They were not
from the Galactica.

18:41.037 --> 18:44.206
They were from the Pegasus.
So what?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.169
What about Helo and the Chief?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.006
I heard a rumor
they're gonna be executed.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.803
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.222
Well,
how're you gonna do that?

19:00.848 --> 19:03.058
Isn't Adm. Cain in command?

19:05.436 --> 19:06.812
What happened to you...

19:06.896 --> 19:08.563
COTTLE: Was unforgivable.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.903
...happened aboard my ship,
on my watch,

19:15.196 --> 19:16.780
and it's my responsibility.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.410
So I just want you to know
that I personally apologize.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.873
See that she's okay,
then back into her cell.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.397
Aren't we supposed to be dead?

19:50.481 --> 19:53.149
Admiral said execution in an
hour. It's been at least two.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.568
Hey, I'm not complaining.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.362
COMPUTER:
ID confirmed.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.947
(DOOR OPENING)

20:06.539 --> 20:09.791
So, just how many different
kinds of stupid are you?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.546
More than we can count.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.591
What's going on, Captain?

20:17.675 --> 20:20.051
Good news,
you're not dead yet.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.805
Bad news,
it's a delay, not a pardon.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.600
There's a big op coming up,

20:26.684 --> 20:28.852
and the firing squad's
on hold till it's over.

20:30.438 --> 20:34.900
Yeah, the old man went to the mat for
you guys on this one, and then some.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.528
We were this close to a
shooting war with the Pegasus.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.449
Frak me.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.577
What the hell's going on? I
thought the Cylons were the enemy.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
Yeah. Now it's us.

21:01.719 --> 21:02.928
What's wrong, Gaius?

21:05.681 --> 21:06.681
Nothing.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.477
Nothing.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.566
I suppose I just

21:18.069 --> 21:19.319
lost interest.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.366
In me?
No, not in you. In...

21:26.744 --> 21:29.037
In this. In this place.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.709
I suppose I just don't
really miss it anymore.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.214
You know what I miss?

21:43.427 --> 21:44.636
Sports.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.305
You're joking.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.390
No.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.479
I used to go to the pyramid
court just before game time.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.730
Scalp two tickets.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.735
If I timed it right, I'd just
be sitting down at the horn.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.570
Sit back.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.782
Let the energy of the crowd
flow over me.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.951
Waves and waves of emotion.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.579
Like electric current.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.041
Why did you get two tickets?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.836
One for me and one for you.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.046
I knew I'd never
get you to go.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.257
Pyramid was far too lowbrow
for you. But...

22:25.761 --> 22:27.971
I always liked to feel
that you were there with me.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.890
(DOOR OPENING)

22:31.475 --> 22:33.101
COMPUTER:
ID confirmed.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.576
Well, I see that you
got it to eat.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.204
That's progress, I suppose.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.792
Can you get it to roll over,
beg?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.210
(SCOFFING)

23:01.630 --> 23:03.798
See what it
can make of these.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.183
You know, this thing
used to sit in our mess

23:14.643 --> 23:17.771
and eat our food
and listen to our stories.

23:19.982 --> 23:23.151
Didn't you?
You just sat there,

23:25.321 --> 23:29.741
listening to us, pretending
to be our friend. Didn't you?

23:29.950 --> 23:31.534
Admiral, please!

23:32.286 --> 23:35.413
Any physical contact with
the subject will only help

23:35.498 --> 23:37.207
to set my efforts back
at this point.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.218
Find out about that ship.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.365
(SCREAMING)

24:38.060 --> 24:39.561
I want to die.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.940
Will you help me do that?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.362
Will you kill me, please?

24:51.282 --> 24:52.782
(GINA SOBBING)

25:03.836 --> 25:06.838
I'm just still getting up to speed
on the way you do things around here,

25:06.922 --> 25:09.340
but I'm reasonably sure that we
can have all the birds in the air

25:09.425 --> 25:10.633
for the attack thing, sure.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.261
I mean, yes, sir.

25:13.929 --> 25:14.929
Thank you, Chief.

25:16.599 --> 25:17.849
MAN 1: Hey! Hey!

25:17.933 --> 25:18.975
(CRASHING)

25:19.059 --> 25:21.060
MAN 2: I got it, I got it.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.062
MAN 1: Give me a hand.
Cally.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.568
Laird's not military, is he?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.612
No, sir.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.364
He was a civilian
aeronautical engineer

25:33.449 --> 25:35.950
on a ship called the Scylla.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.285
Civilian?

25:38.954 --> 25:40.955
Do you know how he got
on the Pegasus?

25:42.291 --> 25:46.085
Scuttlebutt is that the Pegasus
used to have a civilian fleet,

25:46.629 --> 25:48.171
but something
happened to them.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.091
Thank you.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.564
Laird's ship was the Scylla.

26:11.445 --> 26:15.281
The Scylla was
a civilian transport.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.912
We found her
and a few other civies

26:20.996 --> 26:23.248
about a week after the attack.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.671
They were good ships.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.799
FTL drives and weapons, even.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.679
A lot of potential spare parts
that we could use on Pegasus.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.433
So the Admiral
made a decision.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.689
Military needs are a priority.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.151
You stripped them.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.570
You stripped the ships
for parts.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.117
Sweet mother of Artemis.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.329
How much equipment
did you take?

27:06.208 --> 27:07.375
You take their jump drives?

27:11.797 --> 27:13.798
Left all those people
marooned out there?

27:13.882 --> 27:14.924
No, not all.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.473
Adm. Cain looked over the passenger
list and she made a decision

27:22.558 --> 27:25.935
about who was valuable
and who wasn't.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.903
Scylla was the toughest.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.157
Laird and 15
other men and women.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.867
They were all...

27:41.201 --> 27:43.578
All traveling
with their families,

27:43.662 --> 27:45.830
wives, husbands, children.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.874
The selectees

27:48.792 --> 27:51.711
refused to go.
There was resistance.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.631
So, the order came down

27:57.509 --> 28:02.013
to shoot the family
of anyone who refused to come.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.267
So we did.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.522
Two families. We put them
up against the bulkhead

28:14.109 --> 28:15.777
and we shot them.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.001
The CAG's work is never done.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.588
Hi. How're you doing?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.468
Oh, you mean
apart from being demoted,

28:41.011 --> 28:43.930
finding myself working
for one of my pilots?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.975
Great. Never better.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.731
You know I had nothing
to do with that, right?

28:53.816 --> 28:55.024
Never thought you did.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.826
I just checked in
on Helo and Tyrol.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.537
They're hanging tight for now.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.580
Good.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.876
Help me plan this op.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.170
I've been staring
at this roster...

29:18.799 --> 29:21.843
Do you want to just carry on
as if nothing's happened?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.761
Lee, she's in command.
What do you wanna do?

29:24.805 --> 29:26.889
There's nothing we can do.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.353
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.

30:22.196 --> 30:26.157
Were you aware of your true nature
as a Cylon when you boarded the ship

30:27.201 --> 30:30.411
or would you describe
yourself as a sleeper agent?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.583
I knew what I was.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.630
I was a soldier. I had a
mission, I carried it out.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.843
I thought that when it was
done, I was going to die.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.679
That you would kill me.

30:50.432 --> 30:54.310
Then I... Then I would
download into a new body.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.812
Be reborn.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.357
But you didn't kill me.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.151
The things you did to me...

31:02.236 --> 31:05.571
What they did to you
was wrong, evil.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.324
But I'm not one of them.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.619
You have to believe me.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.625
Things are going to get better
for you from this moment on.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.503
I promise.

31:20.671 --> 31:23.631
I don't want things
to get better. I want to die.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.885
But you know you can't die.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.304
You do know that, don't you?

31:32.099 --> 31:35.726
Your consciousness will merely transfer,
and you'll wake up in another body.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.521
Not if you destroy that.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.525
What, this?

31:44.695 --> 31:47.655
This ship? Tell me,

31:52.327 --> 31:54.870
what's so important
about this ship?

31:59.084 --> 32:02.336
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.131
At the moment, we are too far
away from the Cylon home world

32:05.215 --> 32:06.882
for the normal
downloading process to work.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.343
Which is why
they built this ship.

32:09.595 --> 32:13.514
It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.976
Now, this ship has been
traveling with the fleet,

32:17.060 --> 32:19.020
trailing Galactica
for the last several months.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.314
So it's a safety net.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.025
A place where they fall
back to when they die.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.819
And if they lose
their safety net...

32:28.780 --> 32:31.449
Then any Cylon
who dies out here...

32:31.533 --> 32:33.034
Would be dead.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.912
As in, really dead.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.792
And I dare say
they won't like that.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.669
No, sir.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.380
They might even
stop chasing us.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.967
Why risk getting killed if you
can't just wake up all nice and cozy

32:50.052 --> 32:51.344
in a brand-new body?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.973
Doctor, I think
you've just identified

32:56.058 --> 32:57.725
the most important ship
in the galaxy.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.864
I have good days and bad days,
but don't look so worried,

33:11.948 --> 33:13.741
I'm not dying today.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.286
I wasn't worried.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.748
What can I do for you?

33:22.292 --> 33:24.335
You were right about Cain.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.756
Pegasus had a civilian fleet
with her.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.092
Fifteen ships.

33:33.553 --> 33:37.640
Cain stripped them
for parts, supplies,

33:39.267 --> 33:40.476
people.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.148
I wish I could say I was
surprised, but it's who she is.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.026
She's playing for keeps.
You gotta do the same.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.654
What's gotten into you?

33:51.738 --> 33:52.738
What?

33:53.615 --> 33:55.866
You've become
so bloody-minded.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.121
I know that as long
as Cain lives,

34:01.248 --> 34:03.541
your survival is at risk.
I know that.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.959
(COUGHING)

34:22.185 --> 34:23.936
What can I get you?

34:25.439 --> 34:26.814
A new body.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.486
Perhaps one of those
young Cylon models

34:32.571 --> 34:34.655
from the Resurrection ship?

34:35.157 --> 34:37.283
I can't see you as a blonde.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.911
You'd be surprised.

34:49.671 --> 34:50.921
I'll see you tomorrow?

34:51.006 --> 34:52.131
Mmm-hmm.

35:02.476 --> 35:03.809
Commander,

35:05.687 --> 35:07.897
she won't hesitate
to kill you.

35:09.691 --> 35:10.691
Don't let her.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.547
You know,
when we get out of here,

35:34.883 --> 35:37.009
I'm gonna make some changes.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.387
Yeah?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.139
Like what?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.184
Me and Sharon.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.939
It's done.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.446
I mean, really done.
I can't do it anymore.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.616
I mean, don't get me wrong.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.576
LT, what we did,

36:03.870 --> 36:06.956
I would do again
in a heartbeat.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.919
I gotta let it go.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.215
I so thought I'd let go.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.633
Yeah,

36:18.885 --> 36:20.678
I know what you mean.

36:22.264 --> 36:23.305
You?

36:23.598 --> 36:24.890
Yeah, me.

36:25.892 --> 36:29.728
What, you think I don't have
second thoughts sometimes?

36:31.731 --> 36:35.276
You think I don't wonder if
I'm losing my frakking mind?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.696
I'm in love with a woman
I know isn't a woman.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.869
I'm having a baby that's...

36:45.328 --> 36:48.664
That's what, half machine?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.301
You really do love her,
don't you?

37:00.385 --> 37:01.468
Yeah.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.471
Yes, I do.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.976
And I can't let go of it.

37:12.314 --> 37:15.816
But if you can, let her go.

38:16.878 --> 38:20.798
Our primary objective is a vessel
named Resurrection by the Cylons.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.508
It's guarded by
two Base Stars,

38:22.592 --> 38:25.052
which have been following us
throughout this sector.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.430
Our plan, simply put,
is to let them find us.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.725
We will wait
in this system here,

38:31.810 --> 38:34.812
and appear to be conducting
mining operations.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.522
STARBUCK: When the Cylons
launch their Raiders,

38:36.606 --> 38:39.316
Galactica and most of the
civilians will jump away.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.819
A small group of civilians
will be left behind.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.113
To the Cylons, they'll
appear to be having trouble

38:44.197 --> 38:48.158
with their FTL drives and attempting
to escape at sub-light speed.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.412
The Cylon Raiders
pursue the civilian decoys,

38:51.871 --> 38:55.416
pulling the Raiders farther away
from the Cylon Base Stars as they can.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.585
APOLLO: Once the Raiders have
been drawn off by the decoys,

38:58.920 --> 39:03.007
Galactica and Pegasus will jump
in and attack the Base Stars,

39:04.551 --> 39:08.512
while I jump in in the
Blackbird stealth fighter

39:08.638 --> 39:10.431
and take out the FTL drives

39:10.515 --> 39:12.975
on the Resurrection ship,
preventing it from jumping away.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.854
Why not have the stealth ship carry
nukes and destroy it right at the start?

39:16.938 --> 39:20.232
We ran simulations on that. We
determined that the Cylons would detect

39:20.316 --> 39:22.359
the nuclear warheads
and destroy the stealth ship

39:22.444 --> 39:24.903
before it got
within weapons range.

39:25.447 --> 39:29.700
When the FTL is destroyed,
Galactica and Pegasus

39:29.784 --> 39:31.535
will take on the Base Stars,

39:31.619 --> 39:35.122
and our attack squadrons will go
after the Resurrection ship itself.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.416
How many squadrons?

39:39.461 --> 39:40.502
All of them.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.475
Is there a problem,
Commander?

39:56.519 --> 39:59.646
I need time to study
the operational details.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.818
Suit yourself. I've gone over
the details and I'm satisfied.

40:05.695 --> 40:09.782
I want your CAG to stay and help
me answer some of my questions.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.577
One hour, Thrace.

40:13.661 --> 40:14.953
Yes, sir.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.171
Stay focused, son.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.692
Jack, I want to transfer a
detachment of Marines to Galactica.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.363
And I want you
to hand-pick them.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.701
Completely reliable.
Completely loyal.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.371
Razors.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.457
I have a mission for you,
Kara.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.668
Anything for you.
You know that.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.963
Don't accept too quickly.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.382
You won't like this one.

41:10.677 --> 41:11.718
I don't like it.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.306
But I've decided
that it has to be done.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.184
I'm transferring you
to Galactica as well.

41:20.728 --> 41:24.106
I'll tell Adama that you're
there to be my eyes and ears.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.068
He'll hate it,
he'll think you're my spy

41:28.153 --> 41:30.445
and try to freeze you out
of decision-making,

41:31.573 --> 41:33.240
but he'll accept it.

41:33.616 --> 41:37.119
Now, I want you to stay
in CIC throughout the attack.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.538
Stay with Adama.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.082
ADAMA: After the attack
is completed,

41:42.584 --> 41:45.127
and you've accounted
for your pilots,

41:45.587 --> 41:49.006
I want you to land your bird
on the Pegasus to report

41:49.090 --> 41:50.716
directly to CIC.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.928
You'll take Lee with you.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.847
He'll watch your back.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.017
Position Marines in key areas
throughout the ship and keep a squad

42:00.101 --> 42:02.019
posted just outside CIC.

42:02.103 --> 42:05.314
Now, there will be the normal chaos
and emotional high after the attack.

42:05.398 --> 42:08.442
They'll be slapping each other on
the back, celebrating the victory.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.526
That'll keep their guard down.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.445
Security will be lax.

42:14.282 --> 42:17.201
I will ask for you
over the wireless.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.245
I will call you directly. And
when I have you on the line

42:20.330 --> 42:24.041
and you hear me give the
command "Execute case orange"...

42:24.375 --> 42:26.293
When you hear me
say "Downfall"...

42:28.922 --> 42:32.799
...you are to signal the Marines
to terminate Adama's command.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.012
Start it with Adama.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.308
...I want you
to pull out your weapon

42:42.936 --> 42:45.354
and shoot Adm. Cain
in the head.
