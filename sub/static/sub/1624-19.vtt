09:32.036 --> 09:33.403
My friend
Candice travelstead

09:33.404 --> 09:35.552
used one to make weight
for prom.

09:35.553 --> 09:37.123
Are you done with that?

09:37.124 --> 09:39.092
Yeah, switch?

09:39.093 --> 09:40.293
On spring break,
I always loved

09:40.294 --> 09:41.600
spending the day
at the beach.

09:41.601 --> 09:44.144
Just the chilling
and the girl talk.

09:44.145 --> 09:45.915
Yeah.
Tell me again,

09:45.916 --> 09:48.565
about the sound the anal gland
made when you squeezed it.

09:48.566 --> 09:49.936
Please, stop.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.587
I already told you twice.

09:51.588 --> 09:53.654
And now, wynonna Judd
won't even look at me.

09:53.655 --> 09:56.476
Well, not without
her lawyer in the room.

09:56.477 --> 09:59.076
I'm hungry.
What do you eat on vacation?

09:59.077 --> 10:00.780
Anything we want.

10:00.781 --> 10:02.565
Let's see.

10:04.268 --> 10:07.103
I bet their refrigerator is
stocked with all kinds of pates

10:07.104 --> 10:09.989
and cheeses
and those parm crisp things.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.624
By the way, nice suit.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.460
You look like someone should
be pouring a 40 on you

10:13.461 --> 10:15.178
in a rap video.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.114
Thanks.

10:18.115 --> 10:19.466
There's nothing.

10:19.467 --> 10:22.141
I mean, come on,
what kind of gays are they?

10:22.142 --> 10:24.685
All anal gland
and no cheese.

10:24.686 --> 10:26.923
I just expected
everything to be better.

10:26.924 --> 10:28.647
You know,
champagne on ice,

10:28.648 --> 10:30.343
thousand
thread-count sheets.

10:30.344 --> 10:32.860
I mean, the towels...
They're not even bath sheets.

10:32.861 --> 10:34.314
Wait, the towels
aren't good?

10:34.315 --> 10:36.739
Because I already stole two.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.017
They're fine,
they're just not

10:38.018 --> 10:39.324
what I was expecting.

10:39.325 --> 10:40.904
What's happening
over there?

10:40.905 --> 10:43.370
You could use
a little shoulders.

10:43.371 --> 10:45.308
You're right,
enough, we're on vacay.

10:45.309 --> 10:47.110
Come on, let's go get dressed
and find someplace to eat.

10:47.111 --> 10:49.112
Are you crazy?
I am not leaving this thing.

10:49.113 --> 10:51.795
This is the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

10:51.796 --> 10:53.867
Okay, we'll order in,
pretend it's room service.

10:53.868 --> 10:56.258
They must have a menu drawer
here somewhere.

10:56.259 --> 10:57.504
Plus, we'll never
find a restaurant

10:57.505 --> 10:59.386
with a portable sauna
section.

10:59.387 --> 11:01.591
"Food network party tonight

11:01.592 --> 11:03.676
"to celebrate
the release of a cookbook.

11:03.677 --> 11:05.100
Food and drink provided."

11:05.101 --> 11:07.714
Free foodie food,
free foodie drinks?

11:07.715 --> 11:10.049
- Yay, let's go.
- No, I like it in here.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.815
It's amazing.

11:11.816 --> 11:13.503
Ashley wants to go.

11:13.504 --> 11:15.522
Ashley wants to go.

11:15.523 --> 11:17.613
Fine,
but can I bring the dog?

11:17.614 --> 11:19.025
I've always wanted
to be one of those girls

11:19.026 --> 11:20.727
who brings a tiny dog
to a public place

11:20.728 --> 11:22.445
and just
looks at everyone, like,

11:22.446 --> 11:24.953
"yeah, I have a tiny dog,
so what?"

11:24.954 --> 11:26.816
You can be whoever
you want to be.

11:26.817 --> 11:28.101
You're on vacation.

11:28.102 --> 11:29.702
I'm gonna go invite
Brendon to come.

11:29.703 --> 11:31.710
You gotta have a crush
on spring break.

11:31.711 --> 11:34.123
Well,
I'm sitting in my crush.

11:34.124 --> 11:35.923
Hey, shouldn't you
put something on?

11:35.924 --> 11:37.808
Uh, it's spring break.

11:42.283 --> 11:44.300
Aah!

11:46.587 --> 11:49.055
Barbra, get help.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.841
Go, Barbra Streisand, go.

11:56.330 --> 11:57.880
Hey,
look at the book title,

11:57.881 --> 12:01.448
<i>306 degrees of heaven:
Bacon.</i>

12:01.449 --> 12:05.071
Heaven bacon.
That's good wordplay.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.739
It's okay.
Not much of a crowd.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.372
Party's a little
disappointing.

12:08.373 --> 12:10.827
Bacon truffle,
Barbra Streisand?

12:10.828 --> 12:13.085
Mm?

12:13.086 --> 12:17.233
Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog
a truffle, so what?

12:17.234 --> 12:19.068
Miss, miss.

12:19.069 --> 12:20.801
Excuse me,
what are these things for?

12:20.802 --> 12:22.261
Oh, it holds your drink
while you get food.

12:22.262 --> 12:24.924
- Both: No!
- Yeah.

12:24.925 --> 12:27.432
Yeah, these are great when
you see them for the first time.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.178
For me,
it was on a yacht

12:29.179 --> 12:30.394
in the Mediterranean.

12:30.395 --> 12:32.415
You know what else
these are good for?

12:32.416 --> 12:34.857
Frees up your shoulders
to shimmy.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.276
You shimmy.
I'm gonna walk over here

12:37.277 --> 12:41.655
and find us a bigger, shinier
something to do later.

12:41.656 --> 12:43.092
Later?
We're going home

12:43.093 --> 12:44.944
- to our amazing apartment.
- Or not.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.396
Come on, Max,
it's spring break.

12:46.397 --> 12:47.981
Let's not get tied down.

12:47.982 --> 12:49.399
I'll be over there.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.100
Yeah, we'll be over there.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.785
Oh.

12:54.121 --> 12:57.004
Hi. You're not allowed
to have dog in here.

12:57.005 --> 12:58.922
Unless he wants
to buy the book.

12:58.923 --> 13:01.592
What are you,
some kind of foodie bouncer?

13:01.593 --> 13:03.677
Worse.
I wrote the book.

13:03.678 --> 13:05.470
Yeah, nice sleeves.

13:05.471 --> 13:09.052
You get those in
the tattoo gold rush of '09?

13:09.053 --> 13:10.392
I'm Zeke.
What's your name?

13:10.393 --> 13:12.672
I'm Max.
This is my tiny dog.

13:12.673 --> 13:15.105
I take her everywhere,
so what?

13:15.106 --> 13:17.900
Hey, Max, you wanna try
my thick-cut bacon?

13:17.901 --> 13:20.847
Maybe. Let's just
take things slow.

13:22.349 --> 13:23.633
I'm telling you,
it serves

13:23.634 --> 13:25.351
the best
vegan stew anywhere.

13:25.352 --> 13:27.117
You really should put it
in your blog.

13:27.118 --> 13:29.489
Oh, if I write one more
article about something vegan,

13:29.490 --> 13:32.775
all of my devoted
10,000 readers will hold hands

13:32.776 --> 13:35.542
and jump collectively
out a window.

13:35.543 --> 13:38.814
And I know you like to find
what's new and what's next.

13:38.815 --> 13:40.047
Chocolate bacon?

13:40.048 --> 13:43.286
I just need
a minute over there.

13:43.287 --> 13:45.719
Hi, couldn't help
but overhear.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.256
If you're looking
for what's new,

13:47.257 --> 13:48.991
I found these
two adorable girls

13:48.992 --> 13:50.390
who run a cupcake business

13:50.391 --> 13:51.844
out of their home
in Williamsburg.

13:51.845 --> 13:53.630
I know how that sounds,
but trust me,

13:53.631 --> 13:56.146
totally fresh
and not at all overexposed.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.357
And you're someone
I should listen to because...?

13:58.358 --> 14:00.520
Sorry,
didn't introduce myself.

14:00.521 --> 14:03.320
Ashley Emerson,
style editor for <i>Elle.</i>

14:03.321 --> 14:05.530
Oh.

14:05.531 --> 14:07.009
If you're interested,
I think I might have

14:07.010 --> 14:08.177
a card in here somewhere.

14:08.178 --> 14:10.160
Was holding on to it
for Martha.

14:10.161 --> 14:13.449
Mr. Bacon action figure.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.582
A world of bacon sampler.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.737
And I want to apologize for
the food network trucker hat,

14:17.738 --> 14:19.188
which has nothing
to do with bacon

14:19.189 --> 14:21.023
and everything to do
with me being a sellout.

14:21.024 --> 14:22.125
Guess what.

14:22.126 --> 14:23.590
Ashley just gave our card

14:23.591 --> 14:26.829
to a woman who's such a bitch
she must be important.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.081
She's a food blogger.

14:28.082 --> 14:29.215
It's a long shot,

14:29.216 --> 14:30.800
but we need to get
some exposure.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.385
Whoa, we are on vacation.

14:32.386 --> 14:35.388
No business talk.
That was the deal, right?

14:35.389 --> 14:39.475
This is Zeke, chef-slash-
author-slash-corporate sellout.

14:39.476 --> 14:41.650
We were, uh...

14:41.651 --> 14:43.396
We were thinking about
going back to the apartment

14:43.397 --> 14:45.815
- to hang out.
- Oh, sounds fun.

14:45.816 --> 14:47.406
Can I see you alone
for a second?

14:47.407 --> 14:48.851
Well, not alone.

14:48.852 --> 14:51.535
I bring my tiny dog
everywhere, so what?

14:51.536 --> 14:54.390
Come on, I heard
of an after-party in Soho

14:54.391 --> 14:56.325
and an after-after-party
in dumbo.

14:56.326 --> 14:57.577
So, let's go-ho.

14:57.578 --> 15:00.002
Have fun and get
this vacation started.

15:00.003 --> 15:02.699
I'm holding a tiny dog
at a bacon-book party

15:02.700 --> 15:05.168
and laughing with a guy
who wrote a book about bacon.

15:05.169 --> 15:08.176
I think my vacation's
already started.

15:08.177 --> 15:09.789
All right,
well, have fun.

15:09.790 --> 15:11.387
I'm gonna go par-tay.

15:11.388 --> 15:14.627
Eh, did your thing, Ash.

15:23.773 --> 15:25.151
I don't want
to say that I'm hot.

15:25.152 --> 15:28.738
But the bacon
in my pocket is done.

15:28.739 --> 15:31.540
We said turns were
five minutes, you bastards.

15:32.841 --> 15:34.976
Oh, hi.
More sauna fun.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.996
Max, can I see you
in the hall for a second?

15:36.997 --> 15:40.949
But it's my turn
to sweat my balls off.

15:40.950 --> 15:44.235
Don't think the clock's
not running while I'm out there.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.954
We're going
on a real vacation.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.655
How quickly
can you pack a bag?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.207
And don't worry about
appropriate evening wear.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.542
Every four seasons
has a Gucci

15:50.543 --> 15:52.470
near the Bulgari store
in the lobby.

15:52.471 --> 15:55.163
None of those words
made any sense.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.099
I think you've had
a spring break stroke.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.384
No, seriously, there's a car
waiting downstairs

15:59.385 --> 16:01.136
to take us
to a private plane.

16:01.137 --> 16:02.637
We can be at Teterboro
in 20 minutes

16:02.638 --> 16:03.888
and Tahiti in 8 hours.

16:03.889 --> 16:06.541
The Greek
is paying for everything.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.510
What did they give you?

16:08.511 --> 16:10.654
What's the last thing
you can remember?

16:10.655 --> 16:12.313
Nothing.

16:12.314 --> 16:13.866
I just had some cristal.

16:13.867 --> 16:16.327
Some cristal meth?

16:16.328 --> 16:18.069
No, I'm just
really excited.

16:18.070 --> 16:20.738
I went to the after-party
and this shipping magnate.

16:20.739 --> 16:22.323
Don't worry,
it's not gonna be sexual.

16:22.324 --> 16:24.058
More like a father thing.

16:24.059 --> 16:26.754
Anyway, let's go... finally
got us a good vacation.

16:26.755 --> 16:28.839
But we're having
a good vacation.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.565
Max, don't take this
personally,

16:30.566 --> 16:32.233
but you don't know what
a good vacation is

16:32.234 --> 16:33.803
because you've
never been anywhere.

16:33.804 --> 16:35.888
I mean, you walked
into that apartment

16:35.889 --> 16:39.007
and your face lit up, like...
Like it was amazing.

16:39.008 --> 16:41.092
And that's because
you don't know that it's not.

16:41.093 --> 16:43.628
Trust me.
I've been everywhere.

16:43.629 --> 16:47.358
And I'm telling you,
this is the worst vacation ever.

16:47.359 --> 16:50.585
So let's ditch the bacon freak
and the beer bro,

16:50.586 --> 16:53.087
get on that plane, spend
one great day at the beach,

16:53.088 --> 16:55.449
and then come back
and make $8 an hour.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.141
That sounds fun.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.776
You kind of skipped over
the part where we get abducted

16:58.777 --> 17:00.778
and Nancy grace
covers the year-long search

17:00.779 --> 17:02.289
for our bodies.

17:02.290 --> 17:03.931
[Phone beeps]

17:03.932 --> 17:05.584
It must be Constantine.
He's gonna be upset.

17:05.585 --> 17:08.269
You never
keep a Greek waiting.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.904
Oh, my God, Max,
we just got an email

17:09.905 --> 17:12.406
on our website from that
food blogger at the book party.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.659
She said if we drop off four
cupcakes by tomorrow morning,

17:14.660 --> 17:17.628
she'll consider writing about
them for her column that day.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.390
Well, what's it gonna be,
Caroline or Ashley?

17:19.391 --> 17:22.584
Cupcakes or Tahiti?
Your call.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.479
Is the Greek
still waiting?

17:25.480 --> 17:27.387
He just pulled away.

17:27.388 --> 17:29.525
I'm sure he'll come back here
for Ashley sometime.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.236
And when that happens,
I wouldn't want to be her.

17:32.237 --> 17:34.864
Well, after tomorrow,
you won't be.

17:34.865 --> 17:35.990
What can I do?

17:35.991 --> 17:37.732
You mean after
your two personalities

17:37.733 --> 17:39.702
meet and kill each other?

17:39.703 --> 17:41.603
Max, I told you
I needed a break.

17:41.604 --> 17:44.206
I just didn't know it was
gonna be a psychotic one.

17:44.207 --> 17:45.690
You really need
to chill.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.108
You can't
keep freaking out

17:47.109 --> 17:48.443
because you're not where
you want to be...

17:48.444 --> 17:50.445
On vacation
or in our business.

17:50.446 --> 17:53.549
I mean, it's life.
Lower your expectations.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.634
This microbrew
is actually really good.

17:55.635 --> 17:57.652
Tastes better
in the batter.

17:57.653 --> 18:00.055
Hey, crumble up some of that
maple bacon for me.

18:00.056 --> 18:01.839
Sorry about
that stuff I said

18:01.840 --> 18:03.726
about you never having
gone anywhere.

18:03.727 --> 18:05.326
Why?
I never have gone anywhere

18:05.327 --> 18:07.178
or done anything.

18:07.179 --> 18:08.930
And now I'm thinking
that's kind of a good thing,

18:08.931 --> 18:11.049
because I can still
get excited and make a face

18:11.050 --> 18:12.850
when something's new to me.

18:12.851 --> 18:14.153
'Cause, basically,
everything is.

18:14.154 --> 18:15.779
That must be nice.

18:15.780 --> 18:19.241
All right, here,
taste it.

18:19.242 --> 18:22.694
My beer-batter, maple bacon,
spring break cupcake.

18:25.664 --> 18:29.376
Oh, my God, you made
the "something new" face.

18:29.377 --> 18:32.036
I did, because
you made something new.

18:32.037 --> 18:35.406
- It's delicious.
- Do the face again.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.768
Oh, there they are,
the world travelers.

18:45.769 --> 18:47.978
Shouldn't people be throwing
confetti or something?

18:47.979 --> 18:49.704
I'm all out.

18:49.705 --> 18:53.424
I snorted mine
in the power outage of '65.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.860
How was your vacation?

18:54.861 --> 18:57.178
Well, it turned out
to be more of a daycation,

18:57.179 --> 18:59.046
but we had a great time,
didn't we, Max?

18:59.047 --> 19:00.565
Yes, we did.

19:00.566 --> 19:02.868
Max, things sure are dull
around here without you.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.552
Everyone walking around
all P.C.,

19:04.553 --> 19:07.047
nobody called me black.
Hell.

19:08.665 --> 19:10.825
I haven't left once
since you've been gone.

19:10.826 --> 19:13.879
When it comes to this job,
you are my vacation.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.563
Aw.

19:15.564 --> 19:17.732
And that, Earl,
is why I got

19:17.733 --> 19:20.418
all five
of these gift bags for you.

19:23.005 --> 19:25.072
Welcome, again,
to the Williamsburg diner.

19:25.073 --> 19:26.934
This way, please.

19:26.935 --> 19:30.878
I have looked up "down-low"
and "rice queen" on Wikipedia.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.080
And, no, I'm not
a secret homosexual

19:33.081 --> 19:35.609
or a man who chases
only Asian men.

19:35.610 --> 19:38.704
I'm great, I'm straight.
Get used to it.

19:40.864 --> 19:42.523
Hi, guys.
How was your vacation?

19:42.524 --> 19:44.577
Great. Did you have fun
at our place?

19:44.578 --> 19:46.620
Totes.
Your saunas are sick.

19:46.621 --> 19:49.707
I know.
Could they be any gayer?

19:49.708 --> 19:52.099
No.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.652
Just one thing.
Wynonna's still a little upset

19:54.653 --> 19:56.380
about the anal gland event.

19:56.381 --> 19:57.989
What?

19:57.990 --> 20:00.992
I told you she wouldn't
know it was a joke.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.281
How could she not know
it was a joke?

20:07.282 --> 20:10.728
I mean, who would ask someone
to squeeze their dog's pooper?

20:10.729 --> 20:12.813
We're paying you
another 50.

20:12.814 --> 20:15.306
Dude, she went
second knuckle deep

20:15.307 --> 20:19.445
in your beagle's back door
for only another 50?

20:19.446 --> 20:20.904
150.

20:20.905 --> 20:22.797
Thank you.

20:22.798 --> 20:24.315
And just one other thing.

20:24.316 --> 20:26.634
Our business is actually
not that great right now,

20:26.635 --> 20:28.352
so if you could recommend us
to any of your friends,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.164
- that would really help.
- Good for you.

20:30.165 --> 20:32.916
I'm sure business will
pick up after that blog blurb.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.276
- Wait, blog blurb?
- About your beer-battered

20:35.277 --> 20:36.744
maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

20:36.745 --> 20:38.005
We just read about it.

20:38.006 --> 20:40.424
Yeah, in that
foodie bitch's blog.

20:40.425 --> 20:41.884
Max, it worked.

20:41.885 --> 20:43.761
Let's go look at the blog
on Han's computer.

20:43.762 --> 20:45.554
Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

20:45.555 --> 20:48.506
We got a little break
and a big break.

20:57.332 --> 20:59.333
Yeah,
I did it again.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.769
Yeah.

21:07.526 --> 21:09.176
Welcome back.

21:09.177 --> 21:12.005
You missed the best
two days of my life.
