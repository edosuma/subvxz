00:26.777 --> 00:28.237
Hey, everybody.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.489
Welcome to Bull Mountain...

00:30.531 --> 00:32.156
a slice of heaven...

00:32.198 --> 00:35.702
nestled in the cleavage
of Alaska's high country.

00:35.744 --> 00:39.206
It all started when a young
buck named Herbert Muntz...

00:39.248 --> 00:41.667
saw the promise
of a new life...

00:41.708 --> 00:45.212
and staked his claim to it
the old-fashioned way--

00:45.254 --> 00:47.464
he stole it from the Eskimos.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.551
'Round these parts,
he became known as "Papa."

00:50.592 --> 00:53.470
Each year,
Papa would say thank you...

00:53.512 --> 00:54.930
by droppin' his britches...

00:54.972 --> 00:57.808
and blazing down
that mountain bare-assed...

00:57.850 --> 01:01.395
in one of his famous
"moon-shine" runs.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.772
Papa loved to ski...

01:03.814 --> 01:06.149
and Papa loved to drink...

01:06.149 --> 01:09.528
but most of all,
Papa loved to ski and drink...

01:09.570 --> 01:13.198
at the same time.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.869
Last year,
he died with his boots on...

01:16.910 --> 01:20.873
Bull Mountain,
don't go changin'!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.917
And not much else.

01:23.959 --> 01:27.254
Nowadays, Papa's boy
runs the mountain.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.841
But us locals still carry on
the free-wheelin' spirit...

01:30.883 --> 01:32.342
of Papa's life.

01:32.384 --> 01:36.096
You could say that this
mountain's a lot like a woman.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.682
Just when you think you
know every inch of her...

01:38.724 --> 01:40.893
and you're about
to dip your skis...

01:40.934 --> 01:44.771
into some soft, deep powder--

01:44.771 --> 01:47.774
You got two broke legs,
cracked ribs...

01:47.816 --> 01:49.651
then you pay
your twenty bucks...

01:49.693 --> 01:53.197
just to let her punch your
lift ticket all over again.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.510
News flash.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.303
Muntz is selling the mountain.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.096
The entire mountain?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.015
Why would he want
to get rid of this place?

04:25.057 --> 04:27.559
I like this place
exactly the way it is.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.727
Maybe the buyer can supply...

04:28.769 --> 04:30.854
the mountain
with what it really needs--

04:30.896 --> 04:32.397
hot friggin' chicks.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.567
Guys, you know, more girls?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.985
Let's give Lance a chance,
all right?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.862
I gotta refuel the tanks.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.991
Jenny, what's going on?

04:43.033 --> 04:44.159
Jenny!

04:44.201 --> 04:46.245
What's up, guys?

04:46.245 --> 04:47.621
What, are you drinking
without me?

04:49.706 --> 04:50.874
Hey, Lance.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.876
Hey, girlfriend.
What you drinkin'?

04:52.918 --> 04:58.048
Whatever the lady would like,
just put it on my tab.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.343
I will have a beer, then.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.555
And five shots of Goldschlager,
please.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.266
Rick, you are an idiot
not to go for Jenny...

05:07.307 --> 05:09.893
and don't give me
this broken heart rigamarole.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.191
Are you sniffing me?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.112
There you go.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.072
Thank you.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.576
Man. If I was her...

05:25.617 --> 05:27.995
I'd be gettin' with every dude
on this mountain.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.913
Hey, boys.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.583
You're killin' me!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.501
Cheers, everybody!

05:38.088 --> 05:40.966
People.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.970
And Pig Pen,
my poor excuse for a brother.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.263
Our boy Rick here...

05:46.305 --> 05:48.682
has been bitching
and moaning all week long...

05:48.724 --> 05:49.850
I have not.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.311
And I think it's time
that we do something...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.563
to cheer him up.
Don't you agree?

05:54.605 --> 05:59.651
Perhaps tonight is the night
that we crown this year's...

05:59.693 --> 06:01.653
King of the Mountain.

06:01.737 --> 06:02.863
Did somebody just say...

06:02.905 --> 06:04.907
King of the Mountain?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.166
I know you want
to defend your title.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.169
If I must.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.006
Good evening.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.592
You all know the rules
of King of the Mountain.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.801
Rule number one--

06:24.843 --> 06:27.804
you do not talk about
King of the Mountain.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.725
Rule number two--
there are no rules.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.685
What about rule number one?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.563
That's more of a guideline
than a rule.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.773
Do not interrupt!

06:38.982 --> 06:42.402
And now, the three-peat champion
of King of the Mountain...

06:42.444 --> 06:43.904
Rick Rambis. Richard?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.367
OK. Here's how it works.

06:48.367 --> 06:52.996
Everyone must have a beer.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.206
It's a race to the bottom.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.083
The first one
to the statue of Papa Muntz...

06:56.124 --> 06:59.253
with the most beer
in your glass--Pig Pen--

06:59.294 --> 07:02.339
shall be proclaimed this year's
King of the Mountain.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.674
And, as an added bonus...

07:03.715 --> 07:05.926
you also win the contents
of Eric's stolen wallet...

07:05.968 --> 07:07.302
which are, Luke?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.762
Two bucks...

07:08.804 --> 07:10.347
a condom...

07:10.389 --> 07:12.724
expiration date 1 997...

07:12.724 --> 07:14.726
and a picture
of his grandma--no!

07:14.726 --> 07:16.687
That's Nancy Reagan.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.605
But most importantly...

07:18.605 --> 07:20.983
pushing, shoving,
and cheating are encouraged.

07:22.734 --> 07:26.196
Try not to wipe out
like you did last year...

07:26.238 --> 07:28.156
and the year before,
and both years before that.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.366
Thanks, Luke,
I really appreciate that.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.742
No problem.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.910
Pig Pen, if you would.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.495
Strap 'em in.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.832
On your marks, get set--

07:39.168 --> 07:41.670
Everybody ready?

07:41.712 --> 07:43.505
Go!

07:43.547 --> 07:45.674
-Suckers!
-Cheater!

07:45.716 --> 07:47.551
Not tonight, Pig Pen!

07:58.812 --> 08:01.899
Go grand, Anthony!

08:01.940 --> 08:03.233
Don't wipe out.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.280
Here I come, baby!

08:23.170 --> 08:25.255
Damn!

08:27.424 --> 08:29.801
Coming through.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.948
Get away from my head!

08:53.534 --> 08:56.370
Stop!

09:04.253 --> 09:05.462
Hey, no fair!

09:07.256 --> 09:08.632
Nice!

09:12.344 --> 09:13.804
Shit!

09:24.982 --> 09:26.775
Ride 'em, cowboy!

09:30.320 --> 09:31.947
Go!

09:31.989 --> 09:33.365
Let's move it!

09:54.219 --> 09:56.889
Don't let him pass!

09:56.930 --> 09:58.599
We got him, Jenny!

10:00.142 --> 10:02.102
Go!

10:02.144 --> 10:03.353
Come on! We're gonna beat him!

10:10.652 --> 10:12.613
Where did he come from?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.535
His mug's empty.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.704
The beer!

10:20.746 --> 10:22.080
Beer? I got beer! I got it!

10:23.916 --> 10:26.126
Come on!

10:32.341 --> 10:35.344
If you haven't kissed up
to the king, let me know.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.138
Goin' to drink, everybody!

10:38.180 --> 10:39.473
Actually, I have to turn in.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.266
I have to give Mr. Mays
a snowboard lesson.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.228
I got fag practice in
the morning, so I understand.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.814
Walk me home, Your Highness.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.211
Guys, stop!

11:09.253 --> 11:11.380
If you're planning
on coming up...

11:11.421 --> 11:13.799
with some lame-ass excuse
to get into my house...

11:13.841 --> 11:16.176
just so we can "hook up"...

11:16.218 --> 11:18.095
I might let you.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.304
Not that you're being...

11:19.346 --> 11:20.722
particularly charming
or anything.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.892
I guess it's the moonlight
and a bottle of Goldschlager...

11:23.934 --> 11:26.979
that just brings out
the romance in a girl.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.981
Can I ask you something?

11:30.691 --> 11:33.318
You broke up with your boyfriend
this summer, right?

11:36.446 --> 11:37.948
Are we about to have
another conversation...

11:37.948 --> 11:40.117
about how you're still
on the rebound?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.660
I guess not.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.246
Look, Rick, I feel for you,
'cause I've been through it...

11:44.246 --> 11:46.415
but it's time to move on.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.543
The general rule of thumb
is one week of mourning...

11:49.585 --> 11:51.044
for every six months
you were together...

11:51.086 --> 11:54.047
so you were together,
what, two weeks?

11:54.089 --> 11:55.215
Three weeks.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.968
OK. Three weeks.
So, then that means--

11:58.010 --> 12:02.014
I get it. You're right.
It's stupid.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.765
Yes, it is.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.894
So, you still want to hook up?

12:06.935 --> 12:10.105
You gotta try a lot harder
than that, Rick.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.985
So, you still want to hook up?

12:15.027 --> 12:16.862
How's that?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.155
Good night.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.990
Good night.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.535
-See you tomorrow.
-Later.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.912
Hey, listen.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.748
You better enjoy your reign as
King now, because next year...

12:27.789 --> 12:29.541
I'm Queen of the Mountain, baby.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.001
We'll see about that.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.212
Passed out again.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.130
Fire!

12:36.715 --> 12:38.133
Well, boys,
what's it gonna be tonight?

12:38.175 --> 12:39.968
We gonna shave his eyebrows?

12:40.010 --> 12:42.804
Passe. Done that, took pictures.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.350
I'm gonna need a bucket,
a paint brush...

12:46.350 --> 12:47.809
and ten pounds of salt.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.605
Lance, get his pants.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.815
Where are you taking him?
Come on!

12:53.857 --> 12:55.984
Try to hold up his fat ass.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.403
Look at him.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.871
Shoo!

13:50.330 --> 13:52.082
Get!

13:53.292 --> 13:55.043
Good boy--I mean, girl.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.754
Good girl.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.799
My ass is numb!

14:04.636 --> 14:06.430
Look alive, Eric.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.612
John Majors!

14:21.653 --> 14:25.115
Ted Muntz. It's so good
to finally meet you in person.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.242
Welcome to Bull Mountain.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.453
The Eskimos around here
have a saying--

14:33.999 --> 14:35.292
Slow down there, Nanook.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.960
You're gonna give yourself
an aneurysm.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.300
Will you smell that, boys?

14:43.342 --> 14:45.302
Smells like money.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.971
This place has got
some serious potential.

14:48.013 --> 14:51.266
I can see it now, huh?
Can't you see it?

14:51.308 --> 14:54.937
Condominiums, eateries,
shopping, wine bars, cigar bars.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.313
What the hell--bar bars!

14:57.564 --> 15:00.901
Yeah, we can totally sell
this whole rustic bit.

15:00.901 --> 15:04.446
This is a diamond in the rough.
That's good.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.948
Write that down
for the brochure.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.783
No, wait. Better yet--

15:07.824 --> 15:09.201
"Black diamond in the rough."

15:09.243 --> 15:11.245
You know? Sort of a ski thing.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.413
I'm Eric Montclair.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.457
Well, who asked you?

15:15.457 --> 15:16.792
Just kidding, Short Stack.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.628
So it's some mountain, huh?

15:19.670 --> 15:22.047
Yeah,
but the name "Bull Mountain"--

15:22.089 --> 15:25.926
it's a little too...

15:25.926 --> 15:27.719
shitty.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.389
You want to rename the mountain?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.391
Yeah. Something good.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.725
I'm gonna have
to polish this turd...

15:33.725 --> 15:35.477
if I want to sell
my investors on it.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.479
I mean, your hotel
looks like a Motel 6...

15:37.521 --> 15:39.606
ate a yard sale
and barfed it out.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.984
Muntz, there's some
really pissed off Eskimos...

15:42.025 --> 15:43.485
outside right now, man. They
say they want their land back.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.404
Very funny, Rambis.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.656
Mr. Majors,
this is Rick Rambis--

15:47.698 --> 15:49.449
one of our low
to mid-level employees.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.368
You must be the big hotshot
who's gonna buy the mountain.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.245
John Majors of Major Resorts.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.874
Rick Rambis of Rick Rambis.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.042
You any good
on that board there, son?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.752
I'm all right.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.045
You wouldn't mind
playing tour guide...

16:02.045 --> 16:03.547
to an old fart like me,
would you?

16:03.589 --> 16:06.884
Actually, Rick's got a pretty
heavy workload tomorrow...

16:06.925 --> 16:09.386
but I would be delighted to
show you around the mountain.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.388
No offense, Short Stack,
but you give me the creeps.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.265
I think Rick here'll
do just fine.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.516
You don't mind, do you Rick?

16:14.558 --> 16:15.684
No problem.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.728
Good.
First thing in the morning.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.981
I'll take a Geritol
so I can keep up.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.816
Chop chop with them bags there.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.443
So, what does this mean,
selling the mountain?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.945
I don't know.
Maybe this guy will be cool.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.823
Maybe he'll help us build
a lift up to Hangman's Peak.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.075
Can you get an STD
from a polar bear?

16:32.117 --> 16:33.869
What is your brother doing?

16:44.463 --> 16:46.590
What do we got, Whitey?

16:46.632 --> 16:49.259
Solid Gold Dancers
trapped on Beaver Mountain.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.969
Somebody help us!

16:51.011 --> 16:52.179
Looks pretty hairy, sir.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.890
Just the way I like it!

16:54.932 --> 16:57.434
Lock 'em and load 'em, boys!

17:01.688 --> 17:03.106
I'm goin' in!

17:19.205 --> 17:20.999
What are we gonna do?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.956
Please, the whole cabin
is freezing!

18:00.998 --> 18:02.207
We're saved!

18:05.252 --> 18:08.797
Good morning, ladies.
The name's Pen.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.887
A suit.

18:14.887 --> 18:19.308
I need everybody to be calm
and take your tops off.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.810
And tie them together.

18:21.852 --> 18:25.147
Now! Move! I don't have
time to discuss this!

18:28.025 --> 18:30.194
Wicked!

18:30.235 --> 18:32.613
You. Grab me around my waist.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.990
Lower. Nice.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.491
You, get the door!

18:36.533 --> 18:39.161
The door's stuck!

18:39.203 --> 18:41.330
Just jiggle it!

18:43.123 --> 18:45.501
It's gonna be OK, ladies.
Jiggle more!

18:50.214 --> 18:52.549
You have to jiggle the handle.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.510
Jiggle it.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.181
Open the door, Pig Pen!

18:59.223 --> 19:00.474
Come on, man.

19:00.516 --> 19:01.558
Jiggle it.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.143
Open the door!

19:07.189 --> 19:08.482
I'm coming!

19:08.524 --> 19:11.693
He's had a crush on that bench
for a long time.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.909
Did you enjoy your nap?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.966
So, Rick, did you
hit it last night or what?

19:34.007 --> 19:37.010
No, man, we just talked.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.014
God. You know, maybe...

19:41.056 --> 19:43.058
we should clarify something.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.601
When you won the race
last night...

19:44.643 --> 19:46.728
that made you
King of the Mountain.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.523
Not King of
the No-ball Pussy Losers.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.275
They already have
their own king--

19:51.316 --> 19:52.442
my brother.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.569
What?

19:53.610 --> 19:56.864
Are you still hung up on Anna?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.741
Here's what I don't get,
all right, is...

19:59.783 --> 20:01.410
you met this chick...

20:01.451 --> 20:04.204
and you got
freaky-deaky with her...

20:04.246 --> 20:05.581
and then, poof!
She disappears.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.584
How's there a problem with that?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.294
Pig Pen, when I want advice...

20:10.335 --> 20:12.254
about a good
"Planet of the Apes" film...

20:12.296 --> 20:14.298
or maybe how to get the resin...

20:14.339 --> 20:16.717
out of my bong,
I'll come to you, OK?

20:16.758 --> 20:19.678
But I am not gonna take
romantic advice from somebody...

20:19.720 --> 20:22.014
who cannot spell
romantic or advice.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.433
Or bong.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.060
Listen, man, I just want
to hear the story, that's all.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.313
I mean,
you've never even told me it...

20:29.354 --> 20:30.606
not even once.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.900
If I tell you, will you
promise to shut up about it?

20:36.695 --> 20:42.743
I met her at the most beautiful
romantic place on earth...

20:42.826 --> 20:44.745
Cancun, Mexico.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.414
There was this little cantina
called Pedro O'Horny's.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.416
Me and Luke, see,
we had just shown up...

20:49.458 --> 20:50.626
and then I saw her.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.673
From the moment
we caught eyes...

20:56.715 --> 20:58.926
I knew she wasn't like
the other girls there.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.887
She was French.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.931
She had her top on.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.307
Plus, she wasn't puking.

21:05.349 --> 21:11.313
Drink!

21:18.654 --> 21:21.323
We spent every day together
for three weeks.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.991
It was like heaven...

21:23.033 --> 21:25.827
but you couldn't
drink the water.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.162
And then, one day,
she asked me...

21:27.204 --> 21:29.581
to go on one of them
tandem bike rides...

21:29.623 --> 21:32.626
but she never showed up.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.006
I never saw Anna again.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.259
Who?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.635
God!

21:41.677 --> 21:43.178
Chicken!

21:44.179 --> 21:46.765
Guys, a little sensitivity here!

21:46.807 --> 21:50.435
God! Can't you see
this is a dejected man?

21:50.477 --> 21:53.689
Well, Rick, get your
dejected head out of your ass.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.691
Papa Muntz wanted you
to run this mountain.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.903
Carpe the diem!

21:59.945 --> 22:02.739
Seize the...carp!

22:05.033 --> 22:06.243
What?

22:09.746 --> 22:12.499
Make sure you bundle up because
it's freezing out there, OK?

22:12.541 --> 22:14.418
Hey, Toby.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.503
Let me check your boot.

22:16.587 --> 22:17.754
You're good now.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.756
-Thanks, Jenny.
-You're welcome.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.342
Hey, Jenny, you think
you could tie up my boots?

22:22.384 --> 22:24.678
Stewart, I think you
can do up your own boots.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.598
I kind of like
the way you do it.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.933
OK. How about I do up one,
and you do the other.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.727
Cool.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.188
The rabbit and the loops...

22:35.647 --> 22:37.566
I can do it
without the song, you know.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.193
I kind of like the song,
Stewart.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.029
-What's up, Rick?
-What's up, dude?

22:42.070 --> 22:44.239
Get out of here.
You're welcome.

22:44.281 --> 22:46.325
You're pretty good
with these kids, Jenny.

22:47.618 --> 22:50.579
I seem to have a thing
for immature boys.

22:50.621 --> 22:51.914
Ouch!

22:51.955 --> 22:55.083
At least Stewart has his act
together enough to ask me out.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.793
I think we're
checking out a movie...

22:56.835 --> 22:58.545
right after his nap time.

22:58.587 --> 23:00.547
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

23:00.589 --> 23:03.467
Would you...

23:03.509 --> 23:04.927
Would I...

23:04.927 --> 23:08.263
Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

23:09.806 --> 23:11.767
I'm sorry.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.102
It sounded like you were
asking me out on a date.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.312
We could meet at the inn.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.773
Say, 8:00?

23:17.814 --> 23:19.107
Right now I have
to go seize the carp.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.777
-Wish me luck.
-I'll see you there.

23:24.238 --> 23:25.697
Morning, Mr. Majors.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.407
Please.

23:27.449 --> 23:31.537
My daddy was Mr. Majors.
Actually, he was Mr. Mankowicz.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.746
Just call me "John."

23:32.788 --> 23:35.791
OK, John. Well,
where do you want to start?

23:35.874 --> 23:37.668
Most people can't do
the whole mountain in one day.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.336
Well, I ain't most people.

23:39.378 --> 23:41.630
You try
and keep up there, hotshot.

23:57.855 --> 24:01.525
You ever been on one
of those lesbian chat rooms?

24:01.567 --> 24:03.527
-Are they good?
-I don't know.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.489
You see that up there?

24:07.531 --> 24:08.949
That's Hangman's Peak.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.158
Damn. You ski that?

24:10.200 --> 24:13.370
Yeah. It's a hustle,
but, as you can tell...

24:13.412 --> 24:15.038
it's almost impossible to hike.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.331
I think that if we put
a lift to the top...

24:16.373 --> 24:17.875
it would be the most
popular snowboard park...

24:17.916 --> 24:19.459
in the entire country.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.879
You know, Rick, what I'll do--
I'll think on that.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.006
'Cause I like your style...

24:24.047 --> 24:25.632
and I might need a little help.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.843
Yeah? What for?

24:27.885 --> 24:29.178
Well, my investors,
they're coming...

24:29.219 --> 24:32.973
to check this place out,
and, well, they spook easily.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.474
If this deal's
gonna go through...

24:34.516 --> 24:37.186
this whole town's
gonna have to play ball.

24:37.227 --> 24:39.146
I don't think Muntz
has the pull around here...

24:39.188 --> 24:41.565
to do that, but...

24:41.565 --> 24:42.900
you do.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.569
Can you hear me?

24:45.611 --> 24:50.908
OK. As most of you have heard,
by next week...

24:50.949 --> 24:53.452
Bull Mountain
will have new management.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.037
I'm selling it...

24:55.078 --> 24:57.414
for lots and lots
of American dollars...

24:57.456 --> 25:01.752
to your future boss
Mr. John Majors.

25:04.046 --> 25:06.256
Thank you.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.425
Thank you and good morning.

25:08.467 --> 25:11.011
I can't tell you
how happy and excited...

25:11.053 --> 25:12.554
I am to be here today.

25:12.638 --> 25:15.516
Now, I know we're all
gonna be homies...

25:15.557 --> 25:17.809
but I do believe
in the golden rule...

25:17.851 --> 25:21.647
and that is, he who has
the gold card makes the rules.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.234
Pipe down, retard.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.402
And to publicize
my purchase of the mountain...

25:27.444 --> 25:28.695
I've invited my board members--

25:28.737 --> 25:30.864
that's the board of directors
and my investors--

25:30.906 --> 25:32.866
here for
the anniversary festival.

25:32.908 --> 25:35.369
As my employees,
you're expected to behave...

25:35.410 --> 25:38.205
in a manner consistent
with a world-class resort.

25:38.247 --> 25:39.456
Any questions you might have...

25:39.498 --> 25:42.543
will be answered
in your new rule book...

25:42.584 --> 25:45.170
which numbnuts here
is gonna pass out.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.297
I think that's you.

25:47.339 --> 25:51.802
And I have a super-duper
surprise for all of you--

25:51.844 --> 25:53.345
a brand-new, streamlined...

25:53.387 --> 25:56.306
top of the line,
high-performance uniform!

25:56.348 --> 25:58.642
Don't sweat having
to pay for 'em.

25:58.684 --> 26:00.644
We'll just deduct the cost
from your first paycheck.

26:00.686 --> 26:03.188
Welcome to
the Major Resort family!

26:03.230 --> 26:05.858
There's no business
like snow business!

26:06.942 --> 26:08.986
I told you. You look great.

26:09.027 --> 26:11.446
It doesn't really allow my dice
to roll down there...

26:11.446 --> 26:12.823
and by dice, I mean testicles.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.658
Speaking of testicles,
let me get a beer.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.076
The suits
are not that bad, guys.

26:16.118 --> 26:19.705
Rick, these scuba outfits
make us look ridiculous.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.707
Who does this Majors asshole
think he is?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.126
I'm not gonna wear
this unitard--period.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.503
Guys, I love Bull Mountain
as much as anyone else...

26:26.545 --> 26:29.006
but a little change,
it's not gonna hurt this place.

26:29.047 --> 26:32.259
I don't know, Rick. Why would we
even want this place to change?

26:32.301 --> 26:34.636
We don't want it
to turn into Aspen.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.763
But have you seen
the women from Aspen?

26:36.805 --> 26:38.098
I--no.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.474
Other than
the occasional girl...

26:39.516 --> 26:40.767
who comes here
on the weekend trip...

26:40.809 --> 26:42.811
this place
is a sausage factory.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.021
There are gonna be
some hotties...

26:44.062 --> 26:47.149
some slammin' bods
with pants so tight...

26:47.191 --> 26:48.525
it looks like
they were painted on.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.361
Babe, I love chicks.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.447
Chicks love me,
so it's all good.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.573
Calm down, Lance.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.408
Look, Muntz is gonna
sell this mountain...

26:56.450 --> 26:57.743
and somebody's
gonna buy it anyway.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.661
Do you have $1 00 million?
I don't. You?

26:59.703 --> 27:02.664
No. We're not models.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.167
Guys, look.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.002
All I'm saying is
that if we play ball...

27:07.044 --> 27:08.504
the mountain will still be ours.

27:08.545 --> 27:11.965
You foolish boys.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.218
This is how it all starts.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.886
I've seen it all before.

27:15.886 --> 27:17.721
I was there.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.725
Yeah.
It was called the eighties.

27:21.767 --> 27:24.978
Ford was president,
Nixon was in the White House...

27:25.020 --> 27:28.524
and FDR was runnin'
this country into the ground.

27:28.565 --> 27:31.443
I was bummin'
in a hole-in-the-wall town...

27:31.485 --> 27:34.154
in what is now called Utah.

27:34.196 --> 27:36.406
Some fella
from Colorado shows up...

27:36.448 --> 27:39.493
starts makin'
so-called improvements, right?

27:39.535 --> 27:40.953
Well, 'fore we knew
what hit us...

27:40.994 --> 27:43.247
the streets
are runnin' with latte.

27:43.288 --> 27:46.834
It got so bad that
a fellow that liked to...

27:46.875 --> 27:49.503
you know,
smoke a little grass...

27:49.545 --> 27:51.964
or drink a little ripple,
crow like a rooster...

27:52.005 --> 27:55.175
maybe challenge the mayor's son
to a gentleman's duel...

27:55.217 --> 27:58.178
was uncouth, against God.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.556
More like
bad real estate values.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.182
Stumpy had to go!

28:02.224 --> 28:05.686
Richard,
be careful what you wish for.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.063
You got it, Stump.

28:08.105 --> 28:09.356
-I will.
-All right?

28:09.398 --> 28:11.233
God!

28:11.275 --> 28:13.694
I'm good.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.780
Better put somethin' on that.

28:16.822 --> 28:21.368
Welcome to our local cantina.
I like to stop in and have a...

28:21.410 --> 28:24.121
Stumpy's right. You can't
let them do that to this place.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.707
Women or no women,
we gotta stand on it...

28:26.748 --> 28:29.960
and I need to stop talking
for a second.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.726
Hey, Rick, come on over here.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.019
No. You know what?
You guys are right.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.228
This guy's really bad
for business.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.272
I'm gonna go let him know.

28:53.150 --> 28:55.485
Rick, this is
my stepdaughter Inga.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.945
Hello there.

28:56.987 --> 28:59.198
Rick, I'd like you and retard
to show me the kitchen.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.866
Sweetheart,
I got a little work to do.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.409
Buy yourself a drink at the bar.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.036
I won't be long.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.164
Nice place.
When's his lease up?

29:07.206 --> 29:09.166
Whenever I say it is.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.501
Good.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.669
Hey, boys,
look good in those uniforms.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.692
-Boys, watch confidence at work.
-Be strong.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.404
God, here she comes.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.955
What my friend's
trying to say is...

29:47.996 --> 29:49.456
welcome to the El Matador...

29:49.498 --> 29:51.875
which is Spanish
for the matador.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.836
Want a drinkie-poo?

29:53.877 --> 29:55.879
I was wondering
if you can make...

29:55.921 --> 29:59.132
a kind of drink.
It's called...

29:59.174 --> 30:01.927
what is the word
in English for this?

30:01.969 --> 30:03.345
Horny maker.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.889
One fuzzy navel for the lady.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.562
So you're, like,
Majors's daughter?

30:11.603 --> 30:14.231
Schtepdaughter.

30:14.273 --> 30:18.026
I'm supposed to my
schtrepsister be meeting here.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.779
One more fuzzy navel
for the lady.

30:30.205 --> 30:32.040
My schtepsister.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.208
It's Anna.

30:34.543 --> 30:36.753
Oh, my God!

30:40.132 --> 30:41.341
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

30:41.383 --> 30:43.510
It's been a long time.

30:43.552 --> 30:45.596
-What are you doing here?
-I was having a beer.

30:45.637 --> 30:48.182
-In Alaska?
-I like cold beer.

30:48.223 --> 30:50.017
Does that mean--is Rick around?

30:50.058 --> 30:52.227
No. You didn't hear?

30:52.269 --> 30:58.108
Rick perished
in a dogsled accident.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.276
Four dogsled pileup.

30:59.318 --> 31:02.529
And it's awful.
The dogs survived, though.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.907
You used to be
a much better liar.

31:04.948 --> 31:10.078
Anna, I don't know why you're
here, but leave him alone, OK?

31:11.914 --> 31:14.958
Play it once
for old time's sake.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.127
-Play what once?
-Well, the song.

31:18.212 --> 31:20.380
-Song!
-Please, play it.

31:20.422 --> 31:24.968
OK. Well, I think
I could play it once.

31:34.186 --> 31:35.812
-Oh, that's not it?
-No, that's not it.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.397
Very nice, though. Please.

31:37.439 --> 31:38.565
I don't know if I know--

31:38.607 --> 31:40.484
You know what song
I'm talking about. Please.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.487
All right.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.531
Please play it. Come on.

31:47.366 --> 31:48.909
He's gonna kill me.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.162
Thank you.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.999
Luke, I thought I told you
to never play that...

31:59.670 --> 32:01.421
Song.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.382
Hey, Anna, you made it!

32:03.423 --> 32:04.800
Come here, kid.
Give me a hug.

32:06.134 --> 32:09.471
Sweetheart, this is Muntz.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.974
-And this bright young man is--
-We've met.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.980
Majors is your father?

32:18.021 --> 32:21.191
Yes. He likes to think
he's Napoleon...

32:21.233 --> 32:23.110
working his way across Europe.

32:23.151 --> 32:25.988
His first wife was English,
my mother was French...

32:26.029 --> 32:27.364
and Inga's mother was Swiss.

32:27.406 --> 32:29.324
And I just hired
a Russian girl trainer.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.577
Look out.

32:31.618 --> 32:32.911
Hey, girls, it's bedtime.

32:32.953 --> 32:35.539
We got a long day ahead of us
tomorrow. Come on, Inga.

32:35.581 --> 32:37.875
Retard, walk me out.

32:39.710 --> 32:43.380
I didn't know you were here,
Rick. I'm really sorry.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.136
I really have to go, but...

32:56.268 --> 32:59.563
Of all the bars in all
the ski towns in Alaska...

32:59.605 --> 33:02.065
why'd she have
to come to this one?

33:04.860 --> 33:06.069
Thanks.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.616
There you go, Jenny. Enjoy it.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.808
I don't think he's coming,
Jenny.

33:47.778 --> 33:50.822
We'll put him in Rick's car.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.407
Got him, Lance?

33:52.449 --> 33:53.825
I got him, OK?

33:53.867 --> 33:56.912
This is gonna be rightly stupid.

34:01.458 --> 34:04.294
Get him in.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.088
I got it.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.090
-Come on!
-You sure this is a good idea?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.424
It might give him
a heart attack.

34:09.466 --> 34:11.467
As the inheritor
of his estate...

34:11.467 --> 34:14.012
I take full legal
responsibility.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.347
Come on! Get out of the way!

34:15.389 --> 34:17.641
OK, come on.

34:17.683 --> 34:20.643
One, two, three!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.244
OK, they're packed.
Let's skedaddle.

34:37.286 --> 34:38.453
Spin him!

34:44.710 --> 34:48.672
One...two...three...

34:48.672 --> 34:50.882
Oh, my God!

34:50.924 --> 34:53.467
Oh, God! Please!

34:53.510 --> 34:56.179
I got it!

34:56.221 --> 34:57.431
We're stopping!

34:58.640 --> 34:59.808
Lord.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.518
Oh, my God!

35:01.560 --> 35:03.520
What's wrong with you?

35:03.604 --> 35:05.105
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

35:18.493 --> 35:19.703
-All right!
-Beautiful!

35:24.166 --> 35:26.084
This is what you're gonna do
to Bull Mountain?

35:26.126 --> 35:29.004
No. Snownook.

35:30.255 --> 35:33.133
That's the name
my people say tests the best.

35:35.719 --> 35:40.265
Did I ever tell you
how I invented snowboarding?

35:47.189 --> 35:48.941
That's a hot tub, Pig Pen.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.400
Wicked!

35:50.442 --> 35:52.402
Hey, there.

35:56.448 --> 36:01.286
I don't want credit for it,
but they keep givin' it to me.

36:09.294 --> 36:11.547
She's gonna kill me.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.508
Hey, retard.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.803
There's gonna be a lot more
changes goin' on here.

36:17.845 --> 36:20.556
Come on, boys!
You're workin' on my time now.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.273
Wait!

36:29.314 --> 36:32.276
Hold up! I can explain it!
I can explain everything.

36:32.317 --> 36:36.864
Relax. I stopped by the bar
last night, and Pig Pen told me.

36:36.947 --> 36:39.908
Look, I'm really sorry
about that.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.119
I will make it up to you
any way that I can.

36:42.202 --> 36:43.620
You don't have to leave.

36:43.662 --> 36:46.290
Don't flatter yourself.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.417
I'm doing my laundry.

36:50.085 --> 36:53.547
So that means
you're not mad at me?

36:53.630 --> 36:55.757
Yeah, I am.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.259
I'll get over it, though.

36:57.259 --> 37:00.262
Look, I really am sorry.

37:02.556 --> 37:05.392
Look, I don't do
this pining thing well...

37:05.434 --> 37:08.562
so why don't you figure out
what the hell it is you want...

37:08.604 --> 37:10.063
and let me know?

37:58.195 --> 38:00.739
Welcome, girlfriend.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.938
Buy you a beer?

39:55.979 --> 39:57.940
I'm good.

39:59.066 --> 40:03.487
Look, I'd like to apologize
if you'll let me.

40:03.570 --> 40:06.490
There's things about me
you don't know, Rick.

40:06.532 --> 40:08.492
Now, there's something
I have to tell you, though.

40:08.534 --> 40:11.328
You know what?
Hold that thought.

40:12.496 --> 40:14.998
I don't even care anymore.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.834
Cheers.

40:58.375 --> 41:01.295
Hey, you're dribbling!
Watch the shoes!

41:01.295 --> 41:02.588
Sorry.

41:07.551 --> 41:10.637
I'm hot!

41:10.679 --> 41:12.639
-Want to see my piece?
-What?

41:12.681 --> 41:14.641
See, I just started training
for the biathalon.

41:14.683 --> 41:15.976
Where's Inga going?

41:17.603 --> 41:19.938
Don't you worry, little brother.
I got your back on this one.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.317
I'm gonna do her.

41:23.358 --> 41:25.652
But how does that help me?

41:27.863 --> 41:30.574
Well, what do you know?
Just the two of us!

41:41.376 --> 41:44.379
I got trained.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.013
Inga, I love you!

41:54.806 --> 41:55.933
Oh, my God!

41:55.974 --> 41:58.685
Are you hurt?

41:58.685 --> 42:00.521
Yeah, I think so.

42:00.562 --> 42:02.397
Anthony, is that you?

42:02.439 --> 42:06.026
Can you go get some ice
from the bar?

42:06.068 --> 42:08.487
This is Alaska. You're sittin'
on ice, little leprechaun.

42:08.487 --> 42:10.531
Yes. Go, Anthony.

42:10.572 --> 42:13.283
I will wait here with him.

42:13.325 --> 42:15.035
Damn him!

42:15.077 --> 42:16.787
Tell Inga where it hurts.

42:16.828 --> 42:18.455
Evevywhere.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.726
"Duck."

42:41.979 --> 42:43.981
Come in.

42:45.566 --> 42:47.901
Make yourself at home. Just
don't hit me anymore in my nuts.

42:47.943 --> 42:49.319
Sorry. Oh, my God.

42:49.361 --> 42:51.613
This is good?

42:51.655 --> 42:53.490
Yes, this is very good.

42:53.532 --> 42:56.118
Tell me, where did
you get these scars?

42:56.159 --> 42:57.995
Let's see.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.830
Skateboard...

42:59.872 --> 43:01.999
truck accident...

43:02.040 --> 43:03.876
and a fire hydrant.

43:03.917 --> 43:08.005
I bet each one has
its own exciting story, no?

43:08.005 --> 43:09.506
No, not really.

43:09.548 --> 43:11.550
I skateboarded off a truck
into a fire hydrant.

43:11.592 --> 43:14.845
I never met
an American boy before.

43:14.887 --> 43:18.307
Are you all so wild?

43:18.348 --> 43:21.727
Yeah.
We have a saying around here.

43:21.768 --> 43:24.605
No brains, no headache.

43:26.565 --> 43:29.151
We have a saying
in Switzerland, too.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.654
No swimsuit...

43:34.323 --> 43:35.782
no tan lines.

43:38.869 --> 43:41.330
We have another saying
around here.

43:41.330 --> 43:43.290
-What's that?
-I don't know.

43:44.583 --> 43:47.252
I didn't mean to leave you
like that in Mexico.

43:47.294 --> 43:50.589
I'm sorry. I just--
Believe me, I had to.

43:50.631 --> 43:53.967
Why? Some other guy
come sweep you off your feet?

43:54.009 --> 43:55.427
You were the other guy.

43:55.469 --> 43:57.638
-I don't understand.
-I'm engaged.

43:57.679 --> 43:59.515
I was engaged when I met you.

43:59.556 --> 44:01.642
And I love him, Rick.
I really do.

44:01.683 --> 44:05.437
And when I met you...
I don't know, I just...

44:05.479 --> 44:08.315
I fell in love with you, too,
I guess.

44:08.357 --> 44:09.900
I didn't know what to do.

44:12.152 --> 44:14.530
Hey, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

44:14.530 --> 44:17.366
I had ten other engaged chicks
fall for me that week, too...

44:17.407 --> 44:19.368
so I barely even--which one
were you, the brunette?

44:19.368 --> 44:21.286
Please, I wanted
to say good-bye to you...

44:21.286 --> 44:22.454
and tell you everything...

44:22.496 --> 44:24.915
but when the time came
to do it...

44:24.957 --> 44:27.125
I didn't think I'd be able to,
so I left.

44:29.086 --> 44:31.129
And I really did fall for you.

44:31.171 --> 44:33.549
That's why I left.

44:36.051 --> 44:42.766
There, I said what I had
to say, so I'm going now.

44:43.976 --> 44:45.561
Wait.

44:45.602 --> 44:49.231
Look, I'm sorry, too, OK?

44:49.273 --> 44:51.316
For being a prick.

44:51.358 --> 44:54.903
It's just that I was
a little...bummed out.

44:54.945 --> 44:56.780
I deserved it. It's OK.

44:56.822 --> 44:59.032
You did.

44:59.074 --> 45:01.785
You want some coffee
or something?

45:01.827 --> 45:03.871
That would be really nice.

45:07.583 --> 45:11.587
This making out is a lot of fun.

45:11.628 --> 45:16.758
But I'm ready--how do you say--
to schlafenzeit.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.387
Yeah. Schlafenzeit.
Anything you say.

45:27.853 --> 45:29.938
No. What are you doing?

45:30.022 --> 45:33.942
Schlafenzeit. Sleepy time.
I'm going to bed now.

45:33.984 --> 45:36.278
I'm sleepy.

45:36.320 --> 45:40.365
No, stay. We'll cuddle.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.038
Good night.

46:15.234 --> 46:19.446
So...your fiance...

46:19.446 --> 46:22.366
Barry. He's in medical school.

46:22.407 --> 46:24.409
He's flying up
in a couple of days to see me.

46:24.451 --> 46:27.913
That's gonna be a little tricky
unless he's a pilot, too.

46:29.873 --> 46:33.293
He's a pilot, too?
He's a doctor and a pilot?

46:33.335 --> 46:35.087
I think I want to have sex
with this guy.

46:38.882 --> 46:40.843
I have to go now.

46:40.884 --> 46:43.637
Let me show you out.

46:47.015 --> 46:52.813
I just--I want you to know
that I am happy for you.

46:52.855 --> 46:58.652
And...this Barry guy is lucky.

46:58.694 --> 47:00.654
Thank you.

47:00.696 --> 47:02.072
Good night.

47:11.415 --> 47:13.041
Go.

47:44.114 --> 47:47.117
Oh, my God.

47:47.159 --> 47:49.620
You need help don't you?

47:49.661 --> 47:52.247
Just a sec.

47:57.252 --> 47:59.129
How's the hot tub, Luke?

47:59.171 --> 48:01.256
You know,
the Eskimo have nine words...

48:01.298 --> 48:04.510
for a hell mooch
stuck in a hot tub.

48:04.551 --> 48:07.513
Hell, they only got
eight words for snow.

48:09.473 --> 48:11.266
There we go.

48:21.652 --> 48:23.570
Yeah, physics, really.

48:23.612 --> 48:26.406
Expansion and contraction.

48:26.448 --> 48:29.326
All right.

48:29.368 --> 48:30.869
Right here.

48:30.911 --> 48:32.329
One.

48:32.371 --> 48:33.539
Two.

48:33.580 --> 48:35.707
Three!

48:44.258 --> 48:45.634
Was it worth it?

48:49.388 --> 48:50.556
Rough night?

48:50.639 --> 48:52.599
I've had worse.

48:53.851 --> 48:55.644
Thanks.

49:02.025 --> 49:04.111
Anna's getting married.

49:04.152 --> 49:07.948
To some rich asswipe
doctor dude named Barry.

49:07.990 --> 49:09.908
He's coming in
day after tomorrow.

49:09.908 --> 49:11.159
-Ouch!
-Thanks, man.

49:11.201 --> 49:14.162
No. I got molested
by a hot tub last night.

49:14.204 --> 49:15.372
It's a long story.

49:16.957 --> 49:18.500
You know what I really hate
about this chick...

49:18.542 --> 49:21.837
is that I think--I know
that I'm in love with her.

49:21.879 --> 49:23.922
And...it sucks.

49:23.964 --> 49:26.592
-Have you told her this?
-No, not really.

49:26.633 --> 49:30.429
Well, listen, you've got
to do it before it's too late.

49:30.470 --> 49:34.516
Before she becomes
Mrs. Doctor Asswipe.

49:34.558 --> 49:36.768
Otherwise, you're gonna
regret it your whole life.

49:36.810 --> 49:39.479
"No regrets." That's my motto.

49:39.521 --> 49:42.900
That and "Everybody
Wang Chung Tonight."

49:42.941 --> 49:45.360
You know what? You're right.

49:46.528 --> 49:48.739
You're absolutely right.

49:49.907 --> 49:52.284
I'm not gonna let Anna
get away again.

49:52.326 --> 49:55.370
When this Barry guy gets here,
I'm gonna have to face him.

49:55.412 --> 49:57.414
And I'm gonna look at him
and tell him...

49:57.414 --> 49:58.957
like a sensible mature adult...

49:58.999 --> 50:02.336
"Finders keepers,
losers weepers, pal."

50:06.006 --> 50:07.841
I'll have to work on that one.

50:07.883 --> 50:10.260
And if he doesn't like it...

50:10.302 --> 50:12.054
we'll kick his ass.

50:12.095 --> 50:14.473
Definitely.

50:14.515 --> 50:17.351
Attention, all guests...

50:18.685 --> 50:21.313
Where's Jenny?
I don't want to go!

50:21.355 --> 50:22.523
You're going back in line.

50:22.564 --> 50:26.151
Hey, fellas.
Great day, isn't it?

50:27.402 --> 50:28.946
Man, who the hell are you?

50:28.987 --> 50:30.989
I'm the new Team Snownook
patrol leader.

50:31.031 --> 50:33.534
"Keepin' it real
while keepin' it safe."

50:33.617 --> 50:37.204
You on the roof,
knock off the grab-ass.

50:37.246 --> 50:38.789
What the hell is going on here?

50:38.830 --> 50:40.374
Don't you eyeball me!

50:40.415 --> 50:44.461
Hey, Luke, why don't you
mind your own beeswax...

50:44.503 --> 50:49.007
before my fist makes
an appointment with your ass?

50:49.049 --> 50:51.677
Eric, you ever notice
that you're always...

50:51.718 --> 50:53.470
talking about putting something
up my ass?

50:53.512 --> 50:55.848
And that time,
it wasn't even a threat.

50:55.889 --> 50:59.017
Technically, that was flirting.

51:02.187 --> 51:05.399
Wait a second.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.942
Where are you going
with the bull?

51:09.152 --> 51:11.446
Talk to the horn!

51:11.446 --> 51:13.282
Where are you taking the bull?

51:13.323 --> 51:15.617
Listen, I've had it with these
jackass employees of yours.

51:15.659 --> 51:17.077
This morning, there was a boy...

51:17.119 --> 51:18.871
with his little Elvis
stuck in my hot tub.

51:18.912 --> 51:20.455
Now, how in the hell
does that happen?

51:20.497 --> 51:22.666
Well, the jets
can feel quite nice--

51:22.708 --> 51:24.793
Stop talking.
Effective immediately...

51:24.835 --> 51:26.920
I'm taking some steps
to clean this place up.

51:26.962 --> 51:29.089
Poured out
a perfectly good beer.

51:31.091 --> 51:33.177
I love that smell.

51:33.218 --> 51:36.263
That's the smell
of you all getting fired.

51:36.305 --> 51:38.599
What, fired?

51:38.640 --> 51:40.392
Welcome to your first
random drug test.

51:40.434 --> 51:42.311
I'll need you
to fill these cups.

51:42.352 --> 51:44.313
Go make tinkle,
or it's your job.

51:44.354 --> 51:47.107
I don't have to write a test
to tell you that I take drugs.

51:47.149 --> 51:51.737
Pig Pen, you go to the bathroom
in the cup!

51:53.739 --> 51:56.617
Jeez. He's way too into this.

52:05.959 --> 52:08.170
Drink up, half-pint.

52:25.938 --> 52:27.606
I will have your ass!

52:27.606 --> 52:29.107
How you doing tonight?

52:29.107 --> 52:30.484
Thanks a lot.

52:30.526 --> 52:31.693
How you doin', ladies?

52:35.614 --> 52:37.533
Ladies.

52:37.574 --> 52:39.868
Private party tonight, guys.

52:39.910 --> 52:41.286
We're cool, man.
We're regulars here.

52:41.328 --> 52:43.080
Just ask Lance.

52:43.121 --> 52:45.123
What part of "private party"
did you miss?

52:50.879 --> 52:52.798
Hey, there, Rick.
Nice monkey suit.

52:52.840 --> 52:56.510
I barely even recognize
this place.

52:56.552 --> 52:59.263
-A little face lift.
-Can I get a beer?

52:59.304 --> 53:01.723
Hey, Village Person,
why don't you be a macho man...

53:01.723 --> 53:03.725
and cut me some limes?

53:24.079 --> 53:25.539
Hello, stranger.

53:25.581 --> 53:28.125
You clean up pretty nice,
Rambis.

53:28.166 --> 53:30.919
Thank you.
You look amazing.

53:30.961 --> 53:33.672
Thank you.
Would you like to dance?

53:33.714 --> 53:35.507
Sure.

53:43.432 --> 53:46.226
You're not wearing underwear.

53:46.268 --> 53:48.520
You can't with this dress.

53:48.562 --> 53:50.689
Your excuse is better than mine.

53:50.731 --> 53:52.816
Sweetheart.

53:52.858 --> 53:55.611
I need to borrow Fred Astaire
here for one hot minute.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.446
Dance with Tito there.
He loves to boogie.

53:57.446 --> 53:58.614
-Hi, John!
-Hi, boys.

53:58.655 --> 54:01.575
And then I just sneaked in,
and...

54:09.249 --> 54:11.919
What did they do to the bar?

54:16.465 --> 54:19.301
How did you guys get in?

54:19.343 --> 54:21.762
The back door was unlocked.

54:21.803 --> 54:24.056
There's gonna be some
big changes on the mountain...

54:24.097 --> 54:25.933
once I get in the driver's seat.

54:25.974 --> 54:29.561
But I wanted you to know
that I want you to stay on...

54:29.603 --> 54:32.022
and to run
the day-to-day operations...

54:32.064 --> 54:34.483
and be the new manager
of Snownook.

54:34.525 --> 54:35.692
You serious?

54:35.734 --> 54:38.237
Of course I'm serious.
Here's your contract.

54:38.278 --> 54:39.613
Take a gander.

54:39.655 --> 54:44.743
-That's a big number.
-Not bad.

54:44.785 --> 54:47.454
But as the new manager...

54:47.496 --> 54:49.206
all my friends
get to stay on board, right?

54:49.206 --> 54:51.625
You drive a hard bargain,
son, but done deal.

54:51.667 --> 54:53.168
Thanks, John.

54:53.210 --> 54:55.712
Don't thank me.
You deserve it.

54:55.754 --> 54:57.548
Welcome to the team, pard.

54:57.589 --> 54:59.383
You are good.

54:59.424 --> 55:01.510
You're messing with--

55:01.552 --> 55:04.763
I'm gonna take Kung Fu
and kick your friggin' ass.

55:04.805 --> 55:06.181
We'll have the party
at our place.

55:06.223 --> 55:08.016
We don't need their
fancy-shmancy shit...

55:08.058 --> 55:09.643
and their blue ropes.

55:15.732 --> 55:17.609
What's up, man?

55:17.651 --> 55:18.986
What's going on here?

55:19.027 --> 55:20.195
If you ain't on the list...

55:20.237 --> 55:21.446
there's nothing
I can do for you, buddy.

55:21.446 --> 55:23.031
Ladies, how you doing?

55:23.073 --> 55:24.533
-I'm good.
-Mind if we join you?

55:24.575 --> 55:26.326
Not at all. Go on, have fun.

55:26.368 --> 55:29.663
I'm likin' that. Come on, man.
Give me a break. What's up?

55:29.705 --> 55:31.665
Are you from around here?

55:31.707 --> 55:35.377
OK, then $40.
All the locals in free. Come on.

55:48.974 --> 55:50.976
Let me get some of that.

55:59.943 --> 56:02.029
Cheers!

56:05.407 --> 56:07.326
Ladies, you're missing out.

56:10.329 --> 56:14.166
Say hello to the new manager...
of the mountain.

56:14.166 --> 56:17.085
You straight?

56:17.085 --> 56:19.254
Come here!

56:19.296 --> 56:20.756
Hey, everybody!

56:20.797 --> 56:23.926
Cut the music off!

56:23.926 --> 56:26.386
Pig Pen, put her down!

56:26.428 --> 56:29.097
Our friend
little Rick Rambis...

56:29.139 --> 56:32.017
is the new manager
of the mountain, y'all!

56:33.435 --> 56:37.564
And you're all fired!
Every one of you!

56:38.815 --> 56:41.276
Are you saying that
I have to kiss your ass now?

56:41.318 --> 56:42.486
As long as you shave.

56:42.486 --> 56:43.987
-Shave what?
-My ass!

56:44.029 --> 56:48.075
Hey, boss, I'm gonna
call in sick tomorrow, OK?

56:50.869 --> 56:54.957
-Hey, congratulations, boss!
-Thank you.

56:54.998 --> 56:56.458
Watch your hands, mister.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.460
I could sue you
for sexual harassment now.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.337
I'm gonna get me some.

57:00.379 --> 57:01.547
Look, just because
I'm your boss...

57:01.588 --> 57:03.090
doesn't mean things
change between us, OK?

57:03.131 --> 57:05.551
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

57:10.806 --> 57:12.975
She has a fiance, Rick.

57:13.016 --> 57:14.393
I know.

57:14.434 --> 57:17.312
Look, your personal life
is none of my business...

57:17.354 --> 57:18.564
but I don't want
to make a habit...

57:18.605 --> 57:20.566
out of being your
little shoulder to cry on, OK?

57:20.649 --> 57:22.818
Look, I know. I was just--

57:22.860 --> 57:28.198
Yeah. Go. Get outta here.

57:36.331 --> 57:38.083
Can I talk to you?

57:45.507 --> 57:47.926
What I have to say isn't really
gonna take that much time.

57:47.968 --> 57:49.761
I've been practicing.

57:49.803 --> 57:51.305
Anna, I love you.

57:51.346 --> 57:53.932
Rick, don't.

57:53.974 --> 57:55.726
Look,
I'm not gonna lose you again.

57:55.767 --> 57:59.062
Not to Barry, not to anybody.

57:59.104 --> 58:00.480
I want to fight for you.

58:00.522 --> 58:05.110
And...I think
that you should tell Barry...

58:05.152 --> 58:06.820
that things are over
between you two.

58:18.540 --> 58:23.712
You're really not making
my life easy, you know that?

58:23.754 --> 58:25.923
I'm not an easy guy.

58:28.008 --> 58:32.095
There you are! Come inside.
You look so beautiful tonight...

58:32.137 --> 58:34.181
I wanted to see
if you wanted to dance.

58:35.933 --> 58:39.019
Come on. Not you.
Him in his white tuxedo.

01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:18.785
No, you didn't.

01:00:46.188 --> 01:00:48.398
Beautiful.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.488
Why, those dirty
little bastards.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.573
I know it sucks...

01:00:56.615 --> 01:00:58.116
that they're ruining
the town and everything...

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.454
but this
is the best vanilla latte...

01:01:02.496 --> 01:01:05.958
I have ever had
in my entire life.

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:11.171
You can actually taste
the vanilla beans that these--

01:01:13.382 --> 01:01:14.800
I don't like the coffee.

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:18.303
Rick, check it,
the doctor is in!

01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:20.305
It's show time, baby, come on!

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:24.268
So, you girls like Porsches?

01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:26.520
Later.

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:27.896
Let's kick his ass!

01:01:27.938 --> 01:01:29.481
No, let's handle ourselves
like adults.

01:01:29.523 --> 01:01:30.816
Be mature about this.

01:01:30.858 --> 01:01:33.986
Adults kick other adults' asses
all the time.

01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:43.161
Rick, this is Barry.

01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.372
What's up, Rick? Hey, guys.

01:01:45.414 --> 01:01:49.376
Just give me a second here.

01:01:57.593 --> 01:02:01.305
I'm having second thoughts
about kicking this guy's ass.

01:02:01.346 --> 01:02:03.182
God.

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:06.894
First floor, Alaska.

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:09.730
What's up, guys?
It's great to finally meet you.

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.565
Anna has told me
a lot about you.

01:02:11.565 --> 01:02:14.234
Who's the jacuzzi Casanova?

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:16.653
That's him right there!

01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:18.614
They call him that...

01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:23.619
'cause he had himself up in it,
you know, lovin' it strong.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.246
-Thank you, Stumpy.
-No problem!

01:02:26.288 --> 01:02:27.956
Take these twice a day...

01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:30.250
and you will be back
at the plate in no time.

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.877
Will these make it bigger?

01:02:31.919 --> 01:02:34.254
That'd be nice.

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:39.051
So, are you, like,
a crippled guy?

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:42.888
No. I'm just a really lazy guy.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.682
It happened at the X Games
a couple of years ago.

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:47.768
Piled into a fence.
Pretty messy.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.561
They show the clip
on ESPN all the time.

01:02:49.603 --> 01:02:53.565
In the intro
for "Sports Bloopers"?

01:02:53.607 --> 01:02:56.109
-You're that dude?
-I'm that dude.

01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:59.238
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I wipe out all the time.

01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:00.572
Ever since I was a little kid...

01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:02.324
I wanted to be either
a doctor or a blooper...

01:03:02.366 --> 01:03:06.119
so it's basically win-win for me
except now I can't feel my legs.

01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:09.122
Pig Pen, what are you doing?

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:10.666
He doesn't feel that.

01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:12.459
So, anyway, what the hell
does a guy gotta do...

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:14.086
to get a drink in this town?

01:03:14.127 --> 01:03:16.129
Actually, I'll catch up
to you guys later.

01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.841
I have to--nice to meet you.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:21.593
Used to be my bar,
but they kind of took it away.

01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:23.762
They got wine, if you want wine.

01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:25.389
What?

01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:42.781
Staff room, right now,
or so help me, I will get my--

01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:44.449
You don't even have
to say it, Eric. I know.

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.118
Come on. Let's move.

01:03:48.787 --> 01:03:52.124
Got a little surprise
for you boys.

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:01.967
Anthony, Luke, Pierre...

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:05.053
Pierre? Your name's Pierre?

01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:07.139
Majors is really pissed.

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:08.932
He thinks you're all
totally incompetent.

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:12.644
He's given me no choice.
You're fired.

01:04:12.644 --> 01:04:14.813
Effective immediately.
I'm sorry.

01:04:14.855 --> 01:04:17.024
I really am.
I've nothing against you...

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:21.153
but it's either this,
or he won't buy the mountain.

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:23.447
Muntz! How can you do this?

01:04:23.447 --> 01:04:26.325
I mean,
this is all that we have.

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:29.494
What's Pierre gonna do?
He's very stupid.

01:04:29.536 --> 01:04:31.288
And you're gonna side
with Majors...

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:34.166
who calls you a retard
to your face?

01:04:34.166 --> 01:04:37.461
We say stuff like that, too,
but not to your face.

01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:40.464
And you know why?
We're your friends.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:42.508
You guys brought this
on yourselves.

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.593
The hot tub, the drug test--

01:04:44.635 --> 01:04:47.095
you're disrupting
the whole town.

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:54.561
Now...you didn't help me out,
and now I can't help you out.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:56.396
I'm sorry.

01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:59.066
Knock, knock.

01:05:00.317 --> 01:05:03.820
Hey there, Rick.
Welcome to the winning team.

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:07.699
Got you a little gift.
I'll see you out there.

01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:09.159
Hey, thanks a lot.

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:16.708
"Hey there, Rick.
Welcome to the winning team.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.545
"Got you a little gift.
I'll see you out there."

01:05:30.764 --> 01:05:32.766
Those bastards.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:40.566
We rule.

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:45.779
I'm sorry, guys.
My dad can be a jerk, I know...

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:47.948
but it's not like you get
to pick your parents.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.378
Needed burnin'.

01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:03.964
What are we gonna do now?

01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:06.758
I'm not good at anything else.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.220
Not that I was good at this,
whatever this whole thing was...

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.306
but at least
it was familiar to me.

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:14.349
I can fly you guys
down to Anchorage if you want.

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:16.643
You guys can get rides
from there to wherever.

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:18.437
Look, if worse
comes to worse...

01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:20.981
we can always get jobs
on an oil rig.

01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:24.735
Our uncle works on one in Nome,
and we'd be great at that.

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.320
Pig Pen, you're on fire.

01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:32.618
Guys on oil rigs
get laid a lot, right?

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:33.827
On their occasional break...

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:37.372
from their 1 9-hour work day
in the freezing sleet...

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:38.999
yeah, they get laid
all the time, Pig Pen.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:40.792
All right, I'm down.

01:06:40.834 --> 01:06:42.252
I'm in.

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:44.838
We should go
and say good-bye to Rick.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.840
He knows that we're leaving...

01:06:46.882 --> 01:06:48.258
then he's gonna
throw it all away.

01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:51.011
So...we have to do
the honorable thing...

01:06:51.053 --> 01:06:53.514
and steal a few street signs...

01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:55.307
and leave town
with our tail between our legs.

01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:59.353
Oh, my God, guys.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:01.522
What's wrong with you?

01:07:01.563 --> 01:07:04.525
I don't know where to start.

01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:07.444
Ever since they took
my bar away from me...

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:09.947
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

01:07:09.988 --> 01:07:12.908
A lot of drinking
and a lot of thinking.

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:16.828
A lot of thinking
about why I act the way I do.

01:07:16.828 --> 01:07:20.749
Why I feel the need to have
countless sexual conquests...

01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.459
one after the other...

01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:26.296
and I think it's due
to the fact that I'm...

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:29.967
I don't know how to say this.
I'm...

01:07:30.008 --> 01:07:31.343
Gay?

01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:33.387
What?

01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:35.180
Gay?

01:07:37.474 --> 01:07:39.184
Come on, guys!

01:07:39.226 --> 01:07:41.687
Mr. October batting
for the other team?

01:07:41.728 --> 01:07:44.022
Lance, everybody knows.
Nobody cares.

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:46.733
It's OK. You know?
I mean...

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:51.113
if you weren't gay,
you'd be a pretty weird guy.

01:07:52.948 --> 01:07:54.116
Really.

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:05.377
Come on.

01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:11.008
I was just gonna say
that I was adopted, but...

01:08:11.049 --> 01:08:13.594
since we're having
this conversation...

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:23.145
Hey, Rick, lookin' good.
Money suits you.

01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:25.189
Thanks, Mr. Majors.

01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:26.939
Mr. Majors?
What happened to John?

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:29.651
After all,
you're practically family now.

01:08:29.693 --> 01:08:32.487
And not that bogus
Majors Resort "family"...

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.365
that I tell the minimum wagers
they're in, either.

01:08:35.407 --> 01:08:36.867
Where are all my friends?

01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:40.287
They're gone, Rick.
Business 1 01.

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:41.913
Listen, I was doing you a favor.

01:08:41.955 --> 01:08:44.582
See, those guys
are just dead weight.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.960
Now you can run this place
to your full potential.

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:50.796
You'll make a boatload.
Maybe you'll marry my daughter.

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:53.091
I got work to do.

01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:55.010
Get that statue out of here!

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.761
This thing weighs a ton!

01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:59.805
Who is this guy?

01:08:59.848 --> 01:09:01.433
What the...

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:08.357
Bull Mountain!
Don't go changin'!

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:11.026
Get that sign straight, guys!

01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:20.618
I quit!

01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:25.999
That's a $300 hat, bitch!

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:30.962
I can't believe I was so stupid!

01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:34.216
Rick! Jeez, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:36.676
Barry is flying the guys
to Anchorage.

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:39.470
-What do you mean?
-They're leaving, Rick. Come on.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.147
I've always wanted
to be a flight attendant.

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:50.357
You showing a movie today?

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:51.817
It's not "Alive," is it?

01:09:57.739 --> 01:09:59.449
You guys are just gonna leave?

01:09:59.491 --> 01:10:01.159
You can come with us
if you want to.

01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:05.205
You're not gonna throw
your life down the tubes...

01:10:05.247 --> 01:10:06.748
just 'cause we're incompetent.

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:08.000
You were born
to run this mountain.

01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:10.460
This is what you want to do.
You're staying, period.

01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:13.505
I appreciate that,
I really do, but I just quit.

01:10:13.547 --> 01:10:16.842
In that case, hop on.

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:19.344
We got plenty of room for you
if we throw out one of the kegs.

01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:20.846
You can't leave.

01:10:20.888 --> 01:10:24.099
Bull Mountain is not just
our job, it's our home.

01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:26.935
Not really. You've seen
what they've done to the place.

01:10:26.977 --> 01:10:28.854
We're not the locals anymore--
they are.

01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:31.148
Snownook's not our town, Rick.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.775
Bull Mountain,
that was our town.

01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:35.861
Technically,
it belonged to the Eskimos...

01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:37.279
but we stole it fair and square.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:40.282
They're right, Rick.
Bull Mountain's gone.

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:42.117
They even tore down
the statue of Papa Muntz.

01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:43.911
What?

01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:50.459
You guys remember
Papa Muntz's last toast...

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:51.752
right before he died?

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:53.754
No. Remind me.

01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:56.507
He held up his beer, he looked
at the mountain that he loves...

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:58.300
and he said,
"Don't go changin'."

01:10:58.342 --> 01:11:00.636
His last words were
from a Billy Joel song?

01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:01.887
"Don't go changin'."

01:11:01.887 --> 01:11:03.013
Bull Mountain is our home...

01:11:03.055 --> 01:11:04.640
and I say,
let's do somethin' about it.

01:11:04.681 --> 01:11:06.725
It's our home!

01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:09.102
-Let's do somethin'!
-It is our town!

01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:12.564
You got a plan?

01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:15.442
I'm in.

01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:16.610
-Me, too.
-Same here.

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:18.403
Let's do it.

01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:20.322
-Let's do it. Come on.
-Unpack your bags.

01:11:20.364 --> 01:11:23.283
I'm down,
but if we're stayin'...

01:11:23.325 --> 01:11:26.703
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of!

01:11:47.266 --> 01:11:51.019
I've never been
a man of words...

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:54.857
but there's something
that I have to say to you.

01:11:54.898 --> 01:11:59.862
Inga, I've loved you from
the first time that I saw you...

01:11:59.903 --> 01:12:03.907
and I love you more than
any man's ever loved a woman...

01:12:03.949 --> 01:12:08.579
that he's never
actually spoken to.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.707
I'm only gonna
offer this once.

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:15.502
Inga, will you...

01:12:15.544 --> 01:12:18.005
have sex with me?

01:12:23.427 --> 01:12:27.848
Nothing would piss off
my schtepfather more.

01:12:29.141 --> 01:12:31.518
Let's do this.

01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:34.771
All right, guys,
you know what to do.

01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:37.983
It's time to destroy
this little celebration!

01:12:49.203 --> 01:12:54.625
Let's go. Come on, guys.
All right.

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:56.502
Anthony, come on.
What are you doing?

01:12:56.543 --> 01:12:57.711
What?

01:12:57.753 --> 01:12:59.713
It's time to get
back on that board, man.

01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:08.388
Welcome, friends and investors.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.350
We may be 1 0,000 feet
above sea level...

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:14.561
but this is the ground floor
you're gettin' in on today.

01:13:14.603 --> 01:13:17.564
The ground floor of a dream.

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:20.025
Now, with my signature
and your money...

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.818
we can make this dream
come true.

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.947
Yes, sir. The future is ours.

01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.490
Just one beautiful...

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:29.493
state-of-the-art
gondola ride away. Hit it!

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:43.507
I thought I fired your ass!

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:46.969
Inga, get your clothes on!

01:13:48.512 --> 01:13:50.389
You're just like your mother.

01:13:51.807 --> 01:13:54.726
Guys, if this is gonna
be it, let's make it count.

01:13:56.353 --> 01:14:00.023
Stay low, don't hit any kids,
and most of all...

01:14:00.065 --> 01:14:01.483
-don't sit down.
-Why not?

01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:03.569
'Cause we're doin' this
Papa Muntz style, baby.

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:05.571
Get' em off!

01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:09.283
Come on, get 'em off!

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:11.243
Luke, if you would
do the honors, please.

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:14.538
Everybody, pants at half-mast.

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:19.251
Let's put Papa Muntz
back where he belongs.

01:14:19.293 --> 01:14:23.338
All right, then.
One...two...three!

01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:27.759
Four...

01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:30.095
five...

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:32.806
Sorry about that, folks.

01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:35.267
I assure you everything's
completely under control.

01:14:36.852 --> 01:14:39.021
Everything's just fine!

01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:40.606
Duck!

01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.610
What the hell
is Captain Cripple doing here?

01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:45.944
What?

01:14:49.656 --> 01:14:50.824
Honey--

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:52.326
Lock her in the Humvee
till he's gone.

01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:53.952
Nineteen.

01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:55.537
Twenty.

01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:57.664
Come on, baby. Twenty-one.

01:14:57.706 --> 01:14:58.832
Don't touch me!

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:01.084
You better learn
some manners, little lady.

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:02.669
Get in!

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:06.006
-So, what's up?
-Guard duty.

01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.216
Nice!

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:20.771
Everything is fine!

01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:37.746
Hey, man, don't fret!

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:43.877
Afternoon, everybody.

01:15:44.962 --> 01:15:47.965
Rick, you ungrateful jerk!

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:52.886
Get out of my way!

01:15:58.141 --> 01:15:59.935
Stop! Thief!

01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:01.144
Hey, stop those guys!

01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:03.063
Get those guys out of here!
Bunch of losers!

01:16:10.153 --> 01:16:11.655
What the hell's
he doin' up there?

01:16:11.697 --> 01:16:13.907
Wait!

01:16:21.999 --> 01:16:23.709
Shit!

01:16:26.253 --> 01:16:28.213
How's that for irony?

01:16:31.425 --> 01:16:33.468
Come on!

01:16:38.765 --> 01:16:40.851
I'm your father.

01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:42.352
OK. Whatever.

01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:43.937
Go! Get out of here!

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:52.070
All right. At my signal...

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.864
unleash hell.

01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:56.909
Wait! Don't leave!

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.119
So there's a few bad apples!

01:16:59.161 --> 01:17:01.914
So my daughter's a whore!
This is a hell of a deal!

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:08.837
Hey, come on, kids.

01:17:08.879 --> 01:17:11.256
Let's--play safe, all right?

01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:17.137
Was that a bottle?

01:17:29.816 --> 01:17:32.319
-Want to go for a ride?
-Where are we going?

01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:33.695
We're getting out of here.

01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.324
Hang on.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.913
You want me? Here I come!

01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:51.088
Papa...

01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:55.467
you will be restored
to your rightful place.

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:12.985
Why did you take me
around this way?

01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:14.862
Because you're
getting on that plane.

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:16.989
-I don't understand.
-Come on.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:20.033
I'm gonna stay here, so your dad
doesn't know where you went.

01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:21.994
Wait! Last night you said--

01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:24.538
Look, last night
we both said a lot of things.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.207
Some of 'em were true,
most of them weren't...

01:18:27.249 --> 01:18:30.169
but I thought about it, and it
all adds up to one thing--

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:33.839
you're gettin' on that plane
where you belong--with Barry.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:38.260
Look, we'll always have
Pedro O'Horny's, right?

01:18:39.761 --> 01:18:41.013
We'd lost that
until you came here.

01:18:57.446 --> 01:18:58.614
Go.

01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:01.325
Thank you, Rick.

01:19:37.319 --> 01:19:39.780
Think this is funny, retard?

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:43.283
Damn, what was that?

01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:46.286
Is it me, or do you even fight
like a retard?

01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:49.373
Do it!
Call me retard one more time!

01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:50.916
-Retard!
-I hate you!

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:57.548
Oh, you can't get
to heaven on rollerskates

01:19:57.589 --> 01:19:59.800
'Cause you'll roll right past...

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:05.848
Ride, Papa!

01:20:08.934 --> 01:20:12.020
You big lug!

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:18.318
This is how you repay me?

01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:19.820
What the hell you got
to say for yourself?

01:20:19.862 --> 01:20:21.238
I've got one thing
to say to you.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.866
Get off our mountain, asshole!

01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:28.287
All right, fine.
You win. I'll go.

01:20:29.288 --> 01:20:31.248
But first,
I'm gonna whomp your ass!

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.333
Bring it on, big man!

01:20:40.716 --> 01:20:41.967
Papa Muntz!

01:20:45.137 --> 01:20:47.848
Damn! What the hell was that?

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:49.308
That was my dad!

01:20:49.349 --> 01:20:51.226
Look out! Watch out!

01:20:55.105 --> 01:20:56.315
Stop!

01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:59.401
Help!

01:21:06.033 --> 01:21:07.618
Let me go!

01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:13.498
Help me!

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.170
Stop!

01:21:19.713 --> 01:21:21.006
Where's Anna?

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.932
Where's your boot?

01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:35.395
Let's get a drink. Come on.

01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:41.401
Nice work, Lance.

01:21:41.443 --> 01:21:42.903
Hey, fellas!

01:21:42.945 --> 01:21:44.488
Check it out!

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.365
Isn't that Anthony?

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:56.750
Speech!

01:22:00.087 --> 01:22:02.422
Hot sluts with tits.

01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.842
Lance, you don't have
to do that anymore, buddy.

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.552
Oh, sorry.

01:22:06.593 --> 01:22:08.971
Old habits die hard.

01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.138
I love men!

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.557
Lance, you don't have
to do that, either.

01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:12.724
Who wants me?

01:22:12.766 --> 01:22:17.896
Help! Retard?
Short Stack? Anybody?

01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:31.285
Man, you must be proud, huh?

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:36.540
-So, do you ever miss her?
-Who?

01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:39.126
That is the right answer.

01:22:40.502 --> 01:22:42.921
So...

01:22:42.963 --> 01:22:44.840
you want to get a drink
with me later?

01:22:44.882 --> 01:22:48.844
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that, Ricky.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:58.020
You know, things worked out...

01:22:58.061 --> 01:23:02.065
pretty well for our friends
up here on Bull Mountain.

01:23:02.107 --> 01:23:03.358
Rick and Jenny?

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.362
Yeah, they got together,
and then some!

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:09.364
Two sweet kids like that...

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:12.034
they could do mighty well
by one another.

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:15.829
Anybody who ever tells you
that money won't buy you love--

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:18.248
hell, they ain't ever been
to Reno.

01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.875
I was at the buffet table.

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:22.794
This gal comes up to me,
and I flash them dimes...

01:23:22.836 --> 01:23:25.380
and we went right up
to her hotel room--

01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:27.216
well, it was a car.

01:23:27.257 --> 01:23:29.259
This is the good one.

01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:39.686
You're pretty good
on that thing, son.

01:23:39.728 --> 01:23:41.146
I'm a genius.

01:23:47.945 --> 01:23:50.948
Actually, he was Mr. Mankowicz,
but you can call me...

01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:54.201
Set!

01:23:54.243 --> 01:23:56.537
Who is under my table?

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:59.289
Who put a farting machine
under my table?

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:04.378
This uniform
makes my nuts rageous.

01:24:04.419 --> 01:24:07.005
This uniform's
really cramping my Hardy Boys.

01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:08.215
It's no mystery.

01:24:08.257 --> 01:24:10.592
This outfit is suffocating my...

01:24:10.634 --> 01:24:13.220
Lance, can I get a drink for...

01:24:19.643 --> 01:24:22.145
Cut!

01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:35.826
Are we still makin' this movie?

01:24:35.868 --> 01:24:37.911
Are we done with this crap?

01:25:10.986 --> 01:25:13.739
When this country
went off the gold standard--

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.701
Your paper is paper,
nothin' more than paper...

01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:20.120
and if you don't believe me,
by God...

01:25:20.162 --> 01:25:22.206
you go talk to Alan Greenspan!

01:25:22.206 --> 01:25:25.584
I swear to God,
he's runnin' this country!
