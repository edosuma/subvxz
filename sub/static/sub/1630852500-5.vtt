WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:07.200
It just says <i>"Scream".</i>

00:08.280 --> 00:10.720
Yeah, Steven, that's all we need.
So, just scream.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.120
Shouldn't take too long.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.280
Steven, this is Clem Fandango,
can you hear me?

00:15.280 --> 00:17.320
Yeah, I can hear you, Clem Fan...

00:17.320 --> 00:20.600
Why the fuck is Clem Fandango
in a trash can?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.920
It's a free soaking bath.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.560
Didn't have time to go wild
river swimming this morning.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.440
Of course he didn't. Oh, how
stupid of me. I'm terribly sorry.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.280
No problem, Steven.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.720
And any particular reason why
you're dressed as Jack the Ripper?

00:34.720 --> 00:36.160
I'm on the penny-farthing today.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.480
Oh, right.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.600
Just a great way to see LA.
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.240
I bet that's really handy up
the hills and across the canyons.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.440
No, Steven, a penny-farthing's not
practical for that kind of terrain,

00:45.440 --> 00:48.200
it's more for Silver Lake,
parts of Highland Park.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.280
I couldn't give a shit.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.880
What have I got to do?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.200
Just scream, Steven.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.560
Ready when you are.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.640
Sounded pretty good to me.
Alrighty, so, I'll see you soon, fellas.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.840
Have a good day.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.480
Sorry, sorry, Steven, that...
That really didn't sound like a scream.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.560
You what? I said it didn't
sound much like a scream.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.520
I'll just talk to Clem about it.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.800
OK, so we've just discussed it,

01:22.800 --> 01:24.400
and, with regret,

01:24.400 --> 01:26.880
have to say we both don't feel
that sounded like a scream.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.880
Yeah, we just discussed it,
at length, and,

01:30.880 --> 01:33.040
well, neither of us thought
it sounded like a scream.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.280
Yeah, well, I did think
it sounded like a scream.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.880
You thought that sounded like
a scream? Yeah, I bloody did!

01:40.480 --> 01:41.560
What the fuck.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.000
OK, so, we've just discussed it,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.600
and maybe we could write it down
phonetically. Might help.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.200
Just take a sec.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.520
Phonetically!

01:52.920 --> 01:55.440
That's not a scream,
that's just uuuuh.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.840
Well, why not try it?

01:56.840 --> 01:59.160
Well, if I tried that,
it would just sound like uuuuh.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.520
Give it a go.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.320
OK, Steven, we're ready.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.920
Uuuuh.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.440
I think that might have been worse
than the first one, Steven.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.200
Yes, because I can't scream!

02:08.200 --> 02:09.480
Sorry, Steven?

02:09.480 --> 02:11.200
I can't scream.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.200
You satisfied? I cannot scream.
I've never been able to scream.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.160
Even as a small child,
I could never scream.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.360
Hey, hey, Steven,
it's all cool, man.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.400
No, I'm sorry. Look, you're going
to have to get somebody else.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.200
I apologise for wasting your time.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.720
Good morning to the both of you.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.800
Sorry, Brooke, I couldn't help
noticing we're in a stagecoach.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.200
Yeah, I needed a little more space
this week, I got Orson Welles

03:23.200 --> 03:27.680
dropping in, but I'll be back in
my regular office real soon.

03:27.680 --> 03:33.240
Now, talking of stagecoaches, how would
you like to appear in a western?

03:33.240 --> 03:35.080
A western?

03:35.080 --> 03:37.240
Bit old-fashioned, wouldn't you say?

03:37.240 --> 03:42.840
This is one of those modern westerns
with drugs and aliens.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.760
Aliens? Good God!

03:44.760 --> 03:48.120
Well, if it doesn't clash with
Star Wars, then count me in.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.240
You'll be shooting in Death Valley.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.400
Death Valley?
I've heard that's particularly hot.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.920
And what red-blooded man wouldn't
want to be dressing up as a cowboy!

03:57.920 --> 04:02.840
Next week, you'll be having the time
of your goddamned life! Bang, bang.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.120
Hello?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.640
Uh, sorry, Steven,

04:12.640 --> 04:15.960
but there aren't enough unit drivers
to take you to our desert location

04:15.960 --> 04:19.440
so we're going to have to
pull your trailer, if that's OK?

04:19.440 --> 04:21.080
Sorry, what was that?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.560
Good God!

04:30.600 --> 04:32.080
Stop!

04:33.160 --> 04:34.440
What the fuck!

04:40.760 --> 04:42.480
Heaven help me.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.160
Stop the bus!

04:48.880 --> 04:50.320
Christ!

04:51.960 --> 04:53.120
Uh-ah!

05:22.560 --> 05:24.360
Bloody place.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.400
Yee-haw! How long you been out
in the desert, cowboy guy?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.600
Look at his eyes, Gypsy.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.280
That must have been
one hell of a trip.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.960
The fastest way into your mind is
through your eyes.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.960
That's what Barney told me.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.160
Good afternoon.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.440
You haven't seen a film set
anywhere near here, have you?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.880
Is that accent from the past?

06:48.880 --> 06:50.280
No.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.840
Are you Canadian?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.080
No, I'm not.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.280
Wait! I know this guy!

06:55.280 --> 06:59.000
You were the dude sitting
in the creepy photo car.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.760
No, no, no, I'm on my way to
a film set but my trailer ended up

07:03.760 --> 07:05.760
in the middle of the desert,
would you believe.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.800
Far out, man.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.960
Jesus Christ!

07:07.960 --> 07:11.040
You scared the shit out of me!
Where did you come from?

07:12.960 --> 07:14.640
Oh, my God, it's you.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.120
Howdy, partner.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, howdy. Erm...

07:21.000 --> 07:24.320
My name's Steven Toast, and, uh...

07:24.320 --> 07:25.760
...I need your help.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.880
You need my help?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.320
You sure?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.760
We're all here to help
each other, brother.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.720
Fantastic. Look, I need to get
back to Los Angeles.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.320
Is there a town near here
where I can get a taxi?

07:38.320 --> 07:41.440
Hey, Barney, why don't we take him
back to the ranch?

07:41.440 --> 07:46.480
OK, now. What if I was to
give you a ride back to LA?

07:47.960 --> 07:50.920
Would you do something for me,
cowboy?

07:50.920 --> 07:54.280
That would depend on
the nature of the request.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.560
In for a penny, in for a pound.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.600
My!

08:06.200 --> 08:08.800
Say, Snorky, twirl for me.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.080
Twirl!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.200
Blimey.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.720
Get up.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.600
Why don't you girls go with blondie,
fetch my guitar,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.560
and make yourselves look pretty.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.400
Daddy's got talk business
with his new Canadian buddy.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.720
Canadian?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.400
Sit down, cowboy.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.200
Is that a scorpion?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.800
About that favour you said you were
going to do for me...

08:50.800 --> 08:52.760
Yep. I remember.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.160
You know he's out there somewhere.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.080
Out in the desert.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.280
Who? Whom is out there?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.600
Rusty Halloween, that's who.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.400
I sent him off a year ago to find me
the meanest deadliest

09:06.400 --> 09:09.560
sidewinder rattlesnake
in the whole damn desert.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.120
<i>"But, Uncle Barney, why would you
want to bring a nasty-ass</i>

09:15.120 --> 09:17.920
<i>rattlesnake back here?"
</i>you might be thinking.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.160
I wasn't thinking that.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.200
I got plans for that snake.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.840
A guy in Sacramento
twisted my melons, man,

09:25.840 --> 09:27.960
and Barney can't let that roll.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.760
You dig?

09:29.760 --> 09:34.560
So, I got to send him
a messsssssssssssssssssss...

09:34.560 --> 09:36.880
...sssssssssssssss...

09:36.880 --> 09:39.200
...ssssssssssssssssssssage.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.240
You dig what I'm saying, cowboy?

09:41.240 --> 09:45.440
Yes. I'm sorry about that hissing.
I have a speech impediment

09:45.440 --> 09:47.880
which means I can't say the word
<i>message </i>properly.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.760
Yes, you can,
you said it right there.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.920
Did I?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.240
Yes.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.000
Anyway... I need you to find me
Rusty Halloween.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.920
That's all very interesting

09:59.920 --> 10:03.920
but I've got a part in
the new Star Wars movie.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.600
Yeah, sure.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.240
So... I don't really have time to go
searching the desert for snakes.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.120
Mm-hm? <i>GYPSY! Ugh!</i>

10:15.600 --> 10:17.920
You're going to head
in that direction.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.760
After about four hours, you'll hit
a town called Gaping Hole.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.040
Ask for a drifter named
Rusty Halloween.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.480
Gypsy!

10:25.480 --> 10:27.040
Bring out the water.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.920
Do you not have a bigger container?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.120
That's all we got, cowboy.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.760
And don't get any ideas about
cutting loose.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.680
Or coming back without a snake.
You dig?

10:40.680 --> 10:42.120
I dig.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.760
Now, I just need you to sign this.
Snorky!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.320
What the hell is that?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.760
Oh, this thing? It just says that
if you don't do what I ask,

10:50.760 --> 10:52.600
then you agree to be
hunted down and killed.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.280
And what if I refuse to sign it?

10:57.800 --> 11:00.840
Between you and me, she's crazy.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.680
Likes that shit more than I do.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.440
Yeah, so I can see.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.840
All right, I'll sign.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.320
Just here.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.000
Oh, and another thing. Snorky!

11:17.720 --> 11:21.320
When you find Halloween,
give him this goldfish.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.640
Do what?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.520
This is Halloween's goldfish.
He loves this goldfish.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.440
I'm sure he's missing it like hell.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.760
You seriously want me
to travel across the desert

11:29.760 --> 11:31.520
with this goldfish?

11:31.520 --> 11:34.040
Bye-bye, cowboy guy.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.000
Jim?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.640
Hey, Steven.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.320
God, a familiar face.
What are you doing here?

12:29.320 --> 12:32.800
If you want to use the phone,
it's not working.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.520
Don't you have a mobile?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.640
Hm?

12:35.640 --> 12:37.320
Listen, to cut a long story short,

12:37.320 --> 12:39.680
I'm looking for someone
called Rusty Halloween

12:39.680 --> 12:42.480
who lives out here in the desert.
Do you know him?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.200
Jim?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.160
Jim?

13:20.520 --> 13:22.840
A glass of water, please, barman.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.800
And a whiskey,
if you'd be so kind.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.800
I needed that. Tell me, I'm looking
for a man called Rusty Halloween.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.200
Do you know him?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.040
Rusty Halloween?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.000
Snake guy? That's the chap.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.640
Well, I recall
he owned a private zoo

13:55.640 --> 13:56.720
and then one day,

13:56.720 --> 13:59.520
he let all his animals roam free
here in the desert.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.840
I ain't seen him in a while.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.720
You know, it was his damn tiger
that bit of Sheriff Baker's arm.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.120
Sounds like our man.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.040
Listen, do you have a toilet here?

14:12.040 --> 14:13.240
A toilet?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.600
Yes.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.440
Oh, um, a latrine.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.800
A shit box.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.600
A bathroom.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.480
Well, sure.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.520
It's right upstairs.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.680
<i>♪ My grandfather's hands
went a-wandering ♪</i>

14:41.680 --> 14:45.280
<i>♪ Wandering from north to south. ♪</i>

14:45.280 --> 14:46.440
Ooh.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.400
I'm terribly sorry,
this must be the wrong room.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.680
No, no, no, come on in.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.520
My name's Wildcat Lil.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.560
I got Wildcat in my name
but I got a heart of gold.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.960
Howdy, stranger.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.680
Whatcha doing here in Gaping Hole?

14:59.680 --> 15:02.760
I'm looking for a chap
called Rusty Halloween.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.760
Geez, that's one hell of an accent,
are you from Toronto?

15:05.760 --> 15:07.920
No, I'm not from Toronto.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.600
You say you're looking for
Rusty Halloween? The snake guy?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.680
Yes, I am.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.160
He hung around here for
a while last winter.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.040
We're a tightly-knit community.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.800
It's just me, bartender,
never really says much,

15:19.800 --> 15:22.400
Sheriff, Doc Brown,
and Bill, the old-timer.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.160
The sheriff lost an arm in a fight
with a wild tiger, which was

15:26.160 --> 15:29.080
one of the animals released from
Halloween's private zoo.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.160
Yeah, I've just heard
that from the old-timer downstairs.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.200
That tiger is still out there
in the desert somewhere.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.360
Do you think the sheriff might know
Rusty Halloween's exact whereabouts?

15:41.360 --> 15:43.760
He might,
but he ain't around right now.

15:43.760 --> 15:48.080
He's at an international human rights standards
for law enforcement conference in Sweden.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.680
Should be back in a few days.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.320
Mm.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.120
Maybe I'll hang around.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.480
Well, that will be just fine.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.280
Good Lord.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.880
I once heard a preacher in Tucson
say that a goldfish

16:07.880 --> 16:09.920
is as smart as any human being

16:09.920 --> 16:13.440
and if he had heads and arms and legs,
well, there would be nothing

16:13.440 --> 16:16.280
to stop it becoming president
of this here United States.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.600
Well, I don't doubt
that for a second.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.400
You're looking for Halloween,
ain't you?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.120
Yeah. Mm.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.760
I know where he is.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.600
You do? Mm-hm.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.440
I saw him about two weeks ago.
About 20 mile from here.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.640
He lives in an old abandoned
tin mine out by Silver Creek.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.880
An old abandoned tin mine, you say?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.320
Yeah.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.560
And how do I find it?

16:39.560 --> 16:40.880
Well,

16:40.880 --> 16:42.520
the best way

16:42.520 --> 16:43.800
is Google Maps.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.840
In 50 yards, turn right.
Then, turn left.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.960
Oh, shit!

17:05.960 --> 17:07.440
Back in the bag!

17:10.760 --> 17:14.360
You're on private property, cowboy.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.880
Is that a goldfish in your bag?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.880
Yes, it is.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.280
You better come inside.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.760
Ho-ho! My, oh, my!

17:28.760 --> 17:32.080
I can't actually believe it's you,
little fella.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.840
I'd heard you and the goldfish
were close.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.800
Shit, is that your real accent?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.160
Vancouver, right? Sit down.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.960
Listen, I don't suppose you have
any food, do you? I'm starving.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.360
Food?

17:47.360 --> 17:49.680
Supplies ran out weeks ago.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.280
All I got left is, uh...

17:52.680 --> 17:55.440
...a little box of
anti-snakebite pills.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.240
Hey. I've got something to show you.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.600
What's that?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.640
Dolphin World.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.200
In Miami.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.720
Oh-ho-ho-ho, baby!

18:13.720 --> 18:16.240
Whoo!

18:16.240 --> 18:18.320
Welcome home, little buddy.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.880
Welcome home.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.160
Now, ain't that something.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.280
It certainly is.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.360
Look, I'm starving, are you sure
you don't have anything to eat?

18:36.160 --> 18:38.440
Hope you don't mind
having the head, mister,

18:38.440 --> 18:40.160
because I just can't
look him in the eyes.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.440
Not a problem.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.400
It's most generous of you.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.600
Must be a bit weird...

18:47.600 --> 18:50.480
finally reuniting with your
beloved goldfish,

18:50.480 --> 18:53.520
playing with it in the miniature
version of Dolphin World in Miami,

18:53.520 --> 18:55.040
and then eating it?

18:56.920 --> 19:00.040
Lots of crazy things happen
out here in the desert.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.880
I heard you had a private zoo.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.880
That's right.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.680
It started out small.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.600
A few mice and a hen.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.360
And things got out of hand.

19:12.360 --> 19:17.600
Tigers, elephants,
emus, llamas, apes.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.120
Had to let them all go.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.560
There's still a tiger out
there somewhere.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.600
When did you run into Barney?

19:27.600 --> 19:30.200
I'm guessing that's
the purpose of your visit.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.640
Guilty as charged.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.720
I heard he sent you out here
to get him a giant rattlesnake.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.920
That's right,
but I haven't seen any.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.400
Like you, I can't go back
until I find one.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.040
That Barney is mad as
a pack of baboons.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.760
And that Gypsy, who he rolls with,

19:44.760 --> 19:46.960
she scares
the living shit out of me.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.400
She's worse. Mm.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.800
Finally told me if I didn't
complete his task, he'd kill me.

19:51.800 --> 19:57.400
Mentioned something about some chap
in Sacramento twisting his melons.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.440
That's all very, very puzzling.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.640
Ah! That's Barney all right.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.160
That was surprisingly filling.
May I use your facilities?

20:10.160 --> 20:12.200
My what? Your lavatory.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.600
Your water closet. Your bathroom...

20:14.600 --> 20:16.720
...as you Americans say, inaccurately.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.960
This is just a one-room cabin in the
middle of the Death Valley desert,

20:19.960 --> 20:22.800
there ain't no water lavatories,
you're going to have to go outside.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.480
I'm presuming you don't have
any toilet paper?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.200
A toilet what?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.600
Let's hope there aren't
any complications.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.720
Least that sandstorm's died down.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.200
I wouldn't fancy getting
any of that up my Khyber.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.000
Khyber.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.160
Jesus H Christ.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.520
Uh.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.240
I say, Rusty Halloween!

21:08.240 --> 21:10.920
I think I've found your...

21:12.160 --> 21:14.040
Snake? Yes.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.720
I can't believe it.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.400
It's a giant sidewinder rattler.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.880
I've been searching for you
for months.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.440
Open the crate.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.760
Now, stay perfectly still and listen
very carefully to everything I say.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.800
If a rattler feels threatened...

21:38.920 --> 21:43.760
...the best way to avoid attack
is to move very, very slowly...

21:45.440 --> 21:47.000
...assess the situation...

21:48.280 --> 21:49.840
...and listen carefully for any...

21:52.440 --> 21:53.480
Oh, f...

21:53.480 --> 21:54.840
Fucking brilliant.

21:59.960 --> 22:04.080
Don't know how I managed that but
nice job, even if I say so myself.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.160
Now, all I need to do is
nail the fucker shut.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.720
I'm alive.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.960
I wasn't killed by the tiger.
Thank God.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.640
Oh, shit!

22:25.720 --> 22:27.680
Hey, I was talking to Sheriff Baker,

22:27.680 --> 22:31.400
and he was telling me all about
his lecture at the international

22:31.400 --> 22:34.960
human rights standards for law
enforcement conference in Sweden.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.600
Yeah? So, what did he say?

22:36.600 --> 22:40.360
Well, primarily,
there are four domains of practice...

22:40.360 --> 22:43.960
assessment, primarily pre-employment
referrals...

22:46.720 --> 22:48.520
I need help.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.000
Toast!

22:50.000 --> 22:53.200
Looks like your arm's been
chewed damn right off!

22:54.400 --> 22:56.200
Guess we better
clean him up them, Doc?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.360
Hot damn!

22:59.800 --> 23:01.040
You're lucky, Toast,

23:01.040 --> 23:04.440
you've got the kind of arm
that can be easily reattached.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.400
You need to keep it on ice
till you get to a hospital.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.440
I'll just give you
some more painkillers.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.000
It doesn't hurt that much,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.600
not since I took some of Rusty
Halloween's anti-snakebite pills.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.000
Those pills kept you
going for a while,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.640
but there will be a delayed shock.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.920
Believe me, by tomorrow,

23:23.920 --> 23:27.760
you'll be praying to the devil
himself to ease your pain.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.320
Ah, shit.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.840
All right, well,
thank you very much, Doc Brown.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.640
You better get some rest.

23:33.640 --> 23:38.400
I, uh, got a bottle of Wild Turkey
waiting for me at Ma Reilly's place.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.120
I'll see you all tomorrow.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.440
Night, Bill.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.160
I've got to go and perform
a vasectomy early tomorrow.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.240
So, I better go.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.480
Night, Doc. Good luck with that.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.160
I must thank you, Wildcat Lil,
you've been very kind to me.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.520
It's been nice having you around.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.200
I must say, it gets kind of lonely

24:00.200 --> 24:02.840
looking at the same old faces
all the time and...

24:05.240 --> 24:06.680
...you've got a nice face.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.000
Hm.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.000
Ooh!

24:15.000 --> 24:17.480
Well, this is very good.
Very good indeed.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.200
And that'll do it.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.120
Coffee?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.640
Don't mind if I do.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.720
Presuming you don't have any tea?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.240
No tea here, honey.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.840
Ain't got no cups neither so I have
to pull it straight into your face.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.800
All right, just a little.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.240
Last night's sex was superb.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.840
You certainly live up to your name,
Wildcat Lil.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.360
I've never had sex with
a one-armed man before.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.200
Apart from Sheriff Baker.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.600
Where is my arm?

24:53.600 --> 24:55.000
It's in the mini fridge.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.200
Right, well, I better get back
to crazy Barney

24:57.200 --> 24:58.760
and deliver his snake pronto.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.760
How do I get out of here,
my darling?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.480
You can borrow my mule and cart.

25:04.320 --> 25:08.960
oh, darn it! Doc Brown or Bill
must have taken my mule!

25:08.960 --> 25:11.280
Can you pull the cart yourself?

25:11.280 --> 25:13.280
I'm sure I can manage that.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.360
I'll make sure you get
your mini fridge back.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.480
Lucky it's solar powered.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.760
Don't forget your pill.
You heard what the doc said.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.360
As soon as the painkillers wear off,
the pain will be tremendous.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.360
Hopefully,
you'll be back in LA by then.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.640
Let's hope so.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.720
You've been very kind to me.
I'll never forget you, Wildcat Lil.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.200
Goodbye!

25:47.200 --> 25:48.480
Bye.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.880
Shit.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.120
Hey, look who it is.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.360
What happened to your arm, cowboy?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.560
It was bitten off by a tiger.
Your snake's in the wooden box.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.840
Hold on, buddy.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.000
This snake is dead.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.680
It looks all right to me.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.720
Don't dance with me, man.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.920
This snake is as dry
as a goddamn bone.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.840
Why didn't you feed him?

26:52.840 --> 26:56.480
I don't know. I guess that means
we've got to kill you.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.360
Ain't that right, Gypsy?

26:58.360 --> 26:59.840
Sure is.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.280
He signed a contract.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.200
Yeah, at gunpoint.

27:03.200 --> 27:07.560
And I don't remember any stipulation
about the snake having to be alive.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.280
Is that right, cowboy?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.440
Yes.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.760
Turn around now!

27:16.600 --> 27:17.920
Step over here.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.640
What the hell is that?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.280
It's a box with dead rattlesnake
in it.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.280
What's in the mini fridge?

27:29.560 --> 27:32.520
My arm. It got bitten off
by a tiger.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.800
Is that so? Yeah-yeah.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.360
You ever hear an accent
like that before, Mickey?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.120
Toronto, am I right?

27:39.120 --> 27:40.360
Ha-ha-ha!

27:40.360 --> 27:43.120
Looks like we've got the hippie
that ambushed that movie crew.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.400
No, no, no, I'm one of the actors.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.600
I'm actually over here to
appear in the new Star Wars movie.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.320
Oh, yeah, sure.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.720
You don't want me,
you want these two.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.520
Shit. They were there a second ago.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.920
Sure they were. All right.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.080
Now, get your goddamn hands
in the air

28:03.080 --> 28:07.240
and don't you move,
you Canadian cowboy bastard.
