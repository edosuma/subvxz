00:05.830 --> 00:07.616
Jamie! Downstairs!

00:09.661 --> 00:11.185
Go, go, go! Come on, move it!

00:13.056 --> 00:15.058
Police!
Break it up, break it up!

00:15.102 --> 00:16.146
Stop! Guys, stop!

00:17.278 --> 00:18.888
Police! That's enough! Break it up!

00:18.931 --> 00:21.282
That's enough! Break it up!

00:23.588 --> 00:25.155
Stay here!

00:25.199 --> 00:27.027
Get... Stay back! Hey! It's over!

00:27.070 --> 00:29.510
It's over. What happened to him?
Hey. Hey, everybody get back.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.771
Hey! What happened to him?!

00:32.815 --> 00:34.164
Fight broke out.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.924
Turned around, called 911,
and when I looked back,

00:35.948 --> 00:37.559
the guy was laying
on the ground.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.865
Call a bus! Put a rush on it!

00:39.909 --> 00:41.582
All right. I need a bus.
We're at 47th and 8th Street.

00:41.606 --> 00:44.305
We got a guy down,
bleeding out. Brianna, let's go.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.568
Every... hey! Hey, sir!
You can't leave right now!

00:46.611 --> 00:48.048
Get back! You, too!

00:48.091 --> 00:49.527
Stay back! Break that up!

00:49.571 --> 00:52.313
Nobody gets out of here
without getting I.D.'d first!

00:52.356 --> 00:54.663
Put your hands on the bar!

00:58.797 --> 01:00.712
Police, fire or medical,
what's your emergency?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.107
There's someone
breaking into my house.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.804
Okay, ma'am.
What's your address?

01:05.848 --> 01:07.371
12 Bayview Avenue, Malba.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.156
Get up.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.724
Now. Let's go, now. What's the matter, Mom?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.920
Get up. You know what you
have to do. Here's the phone.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.685
But... Go. Go! Now!

01:16.728 --> 01:18.034
Go!

01:18.078 --> 01:21.255
Quiet, unless I say anything.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.128
Janko, hop on the bus
with the victim.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.999
Keep me updated
from the hospital.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.523
Sure thing, boss.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.786
Officer, have they
been Mirandized?

01:30.829 --> 01:31.787
Yes, they were, Sarge.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.355
Okay. I want him, him, him, him

01:34.398 --> 01:35.791
and her all going
to the precinct.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.880
I want them all transported
separately, all right?

01:37.923 --> 01:39.142
Davis, take her.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.206
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I don't understand.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.318
We didn't do anything.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.798
You're coming with me. No!

01:42.841 --> 01:44.843
We didn't do anything! Hey! Hey! Let's go!

01:44.887 --> 01:46.952
All right, she said
she didn't do anything! JAMIE Hey. Hey.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.108
You get your hands off her.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.805
Hey.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.894
Taking a ride. Come on.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.897
Can you tell me
how this fight got started?

01:54.940 --> 01:57.639
I got a lawyer who makes more
in a day than you do in a year,

01:57.682 --> 01:59.162
so I don't have to
tell you anything.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.077
Good. Tell the judge, then.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.384
You saw what happened
to the last guy

02:03.427 --> 02:05.342
that got into it with me.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.039
I stabbed him.

02:08.866 --> 02:10.782
He deserved it.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.181
Reagan.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.226
It's Isabel Delgado.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.141
I think someone is here
to kill me.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.229
Okay, where are you?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.839
At my house!

02:23.882 --> 02:24.970
Did you call 911?

02:25.014 --> 02:26.189
I already did.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.645
They said they were
on their way, but...

02:27.669 --> 02:29.192
First, calm down, all right?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.498
My God!

02:30.541 --> 02:31.803
Where are the boys?

02:31.847 --> 02:33.327
God! Hello?

02:34.241 --> 02:36.982
No! No!

02:37.026 --> 02:38.114
Isabel!

02:38.158 --> 02:40.116
No! No!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.161
No!

02:41.204 --> 02:42.858
No! No! Damn it.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.875
Where is she? The living room.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.616
What about the boys?
Where are they?

03:01.659 --> 03:03.052
What boys?

03:03.095 --> 03:04.488
The two sons. Where are they?

03:04.532 --> 03:07.274
I don't know. We did a search.
We didn't find anybody.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.110
This is not good.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.330
I'm gonna look around.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.246
Get CSU and the ME's office
over here.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.035
Boys?

03:33.691 --> 03:34.997
Boys?

03:42.744 --> 03:43.832
Boys?

03:48.793 --> 03:51.143
Hey. It's okay.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.797
I'm the police.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.365
Your mom wanted me to find you

03:55.409 --> 03:56.975
and get you out of there, okay?

03:57.019 --> 03:59.413
Why don't you do me a favor.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.069
Hey. It's okay.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.941
Promise you, it's safe.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.073
Come on.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.947
You, too. Come on.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.310
Mom? Mom? Okay. We're gonna go...

04:13.340 --> 04:14.950
We'll go talk about that
right now.

04:14.993 --> 04:15.994
Hey, hey, hey!

04:16.038 --> 04:17.387
Don't move! Get your hands up!

04:17.430 --> 04:18.997
I'm unarmed, okay?!

04:19.041 --> 04:21.826
Dad! Wait.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.175
Hold on.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.588
All right, come here.
Come here. I'm here now.

04:24.612 --> 04:27.005
Come here. I'm here.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.051
Daddy's here now, okay?
Daddy's here.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.053
All right. You okay?

04:32.141 --> 04:33.273
Where's Mom?

04:36.928 --> 04:38.103
Where's my wife?

04:38.147 --> 04:39.975
Boys, why don't you come with me

04:40.018 --> 04:42.760
for a minute so your dad
can talk to Detective Reagan.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.196
You guys got to go.No.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.328
No, I don't want to go.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.677
Go with the nice lady.
All right?

04:46.721 --> 04:47.939
No.You got to go. All right?

04:47.983 --> 04:50.246
Go.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.684
Can't go inside.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.687
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:56.731 --> 04:58.689
Let him go. Let him go.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.604
Isabel!

05:02.171 --> 05:04.347
No. No.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.914
No.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.090
No.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.961
No, no.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.015
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.756
I'm so sorry.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.853
Tomorrow morning,
we're rolling out

05:55.877 --> 05:57.357
the Crime Stopper trucks
in Midtown.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.749
Good.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.553
And you're scheduled for
a photo op with the chiefs.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.188
Putting the use-of-force
report in your bag

06:03.232 --> 06:06.061
so you can look at it
on the way home.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.584
How about the highlights?

06:07.628 --> 06:09.238
Lowest firearms discharges

06:09.281 --> 06:11.719
since we started
keeping record in 1971.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.068
Good. Which you'll lead with

06:13.111 --> 06:14.635
at the presser tomorrow morning.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.898
Okay. My detail ready?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.777
Okay.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.257
What was that look about?

06:28.300 --> 06:29.867
We've learned that
there's some division

06:29.911 --> 06:32.000
in the 16th between the precinct

06:32.043 --> 06:33.654
and some members
of the community.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.090
Okay.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.894
There's a small community group
who always shows up

06:36.918 --> 06:38.876
to complain about
quality-of-life crimes,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.182
stuff like that.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.096
Okay.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.358
Well, this community group

06:42.402 --> 06:45.143
has gotten very demanding.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.493
One woman in particular

06:46.536 --> 06:48.843
has been throwing
your name around.

06:48.886 --> 06:49.713
Well...

06:49.757 --> 06:50.932
Saying she has your ear,

06:50.975 --> 06:53.543
and that if the C.O.
doesn't beef up security

06:53.587 --> 06:56.024
in certain buildings,
she's gonna give you a call

06:56.067 --> 06:57.286
and have him fired.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.331
Okay. So take care of it.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.290
Since when have any of you
had a problem

07:01.333 --> 07:03.466
setting the record straight
on my behalf?

07:03.510 --> 07:06.991
Since the lady's
about to be your sister.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.908
Excuse me?

07:14.042 --> 07:17.262
It's Eddie's mother, Lena Janko.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.922
Okay.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.366
I've never even met her.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.935
Boss, I think
you should meet with her.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.807
See what the problem is,

07:39.850 --> 07:41.983
do everything you can to fix it,

07:42.026 --> 07:45.073
and then make sure she knows
it's a onetime deal.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.340
That could be icky.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.735
You heard the term
"happy wife, happy life"?

07:54.778 --> 07:57.389
That applies
to mother-in-laws, too.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.526
Sid's right.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.884
Hey. What's going on?

08:13.928 --> 08:17.671
I got stuck with homicide call.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.500
You have a Mark Sanzo in
custody for attempted murder?

08:20.543 --> 08:22.153
No, not attempted.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.517
Just got off the phone
with Eddie.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
Campbell died
on the operating table.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.332
What do you have on Sanzo?

08:27.376 --> 08:29.334
He said he did it. Was he Mirandized?

08:29.378 --> 08:31.467
Yes. Signed statement?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.489
What difference does that make?
He already confessed.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.924
Well, I'm just
gathering facts, Jamie.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.212
He asked for a lawyer,
and so all questions ceased.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.520
And what about
the murder weapon?

08:40.563 --> 08:41.825
We can't find one yet.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.219
ADA Reagan.

08:44.261 --> 08:47.135
I'm Ashley Dirk,
representing Mark Sanzo.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.852
Well, your client
will be charged with murder

08:48.876 --> 08:51.531
in the second degree for
the death of Stephen Campbell.

08:51.574 --> 08:52.836
Based on what?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.012
He confessed to
a police officer at the scene.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.274
And is that police officer

08:56.318 --> 08:58.320
the only witness
to the alleged confession?

08:58.363 --> 09:00.148
What difference does that make?

09:00.191 --> 09:01.410
Guess you're the officer.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.543
Reagan. Any relation?

09:03.586 --> 09:05.501
My brother, Sergeant Reagan.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.502
That's rich.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.591
You calling me a liar?

09:08.635 --> 09:09.592
Yes.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.854
I am.

09:10.898 --> 09:11.507
And now I'd like

09:11.551 --> 09:12.595
to see my client.

09:12.639 --> 09:13.964
You can see him
at his arraignment.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.381
I can handle this,
Sergeant Reagan. Thank you.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.061
Do you have a murder weapon?

09:24.085 --> 09:25.913
Not yet. And a jury won't be

09:25.956 --> 09:28.829
suspicious of a confession
where the only witness

09:28.872 --> 09:31.745
is your cop brother and there's
no corroborating evidence?

09:31.788 --> 09:34.182
I guess we'll find out
in court, won't we?

09:36.924 --> 09:39.709
I want a blood alcohol test
on my client.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.450
Fine. I'll arrange it.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.626
And I'll arrange a hearing
on the admissibility

09:43.670 --> 09:44.801
of the alleged statement.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.835
Lena, nice to finally meet you.

10:18.879 --> 10:22.273
Now I know where Jamie
got his good manners from.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.275
And his good looks.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.496
Mwah. Mwah.

10:29.106 --> 10:33.284
This is my first time in
a police commissioner's office.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.509
It's so nice.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.554
Very masculine.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.429
Given the family
history, it's ironic

10:47.472 --> 10:50.388
that Edit is marrying into
a cop's family, don't you think?

10:50.432 --> 10:52.042
Eddie is a terrific cop.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.783
Edit. Her name is Edit.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.481
Edit is a terrific cop.

10:56.525 --> 10:57.526
Please.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.449
You know,
my real name's Francis,

11:07.492 --> 11:09.625
but hardly anyone calls me that.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.322
Well, I can understand
why my daughter

11:11.366 --> 11:13.760
loves your
family so much. And we love her.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.805
And I love that I'm never
gonna have to pay

11:15.849 --> 11:17.894
for a parking ticket again.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.767
Well...

11:20.810 --> 11:23.465
Don't I get one of those
"get out of jail free" cards?

11:23.508 --> 11:26.424
Well, actually,
they're called courtesy cards,

11:26.468 --> 11:29.253
as in "please extend
all courtesies."

11:29.297 --> 11:31.865
And avoiding the
night in the clink

11:31.908 --> 11:34.389
would be a real
courtesy, I get it.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.739
I'm not sure you do.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.828
Francis.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.134
Lena.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.851
What's the point of a job
if you can't take

11:41.875 --> 11:43.964
full advantage of it?

11:44.007 --> 11:49.665
Well, see, we try very hard
not to use the job

11:49.709 --> 11:53.974
or the family name
to influence outcomes.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.022
But, that being said,

11:59.066 --> 12:02.460
if there's anything
you need some advice on,

12:02.504 --> 12:04.593
I'm your guy.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.552
You mean like how many layers
should the wedding cake be

12:07.596 --> 12:08.989
or who's on the guest list?

12:09.032 --> 12:14.168
Actually, I think that's
Jamie and Edit's bailiwick.

12:14.211 --> 12:18.912
I know she's been wanting
to introduce you and I,

12:18.955 --> 12:22.002
but I've been so busy,
what with moving and all.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.787
So, she's gonna be very happy
that we finally met.

12:24.831 --> 12:29.270
No, I think it's best if Edit
didn't know that I was here.

12:29.313 --> 12:32.621
She would be very disappointed
that she wasn't here for it.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.928
I know she's very sensitive
about these things,

12:34.971 --> 12:38.714
and... I wouldn't
want to upset her.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.720
Okay.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.686
It's very nice
to meet you, Francis.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.745
So, Luis Delgado just
walked right up to you

13:09.789 --> 13:11.747
after being on the lam
for six months?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.531
Who the hell are you?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.751
Agent John Wise, DEA.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.100
You two know each other?

13:17.144 --> 13:18.469
He was my brother's handler
when he was a CI.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.190
Delgado is my damn case.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.149
No, Delgado's our collar.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.803
But his charges are federal.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.868
Good. Well, you can get to those
after we're done with him.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.242
You're the ones that
lost him in the first place.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.113
We all want to get
Sangriento, right?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.290
Delgado can help us do that.

13:33.334 --> 13:36.076
I'm willing to work
with you on this. I'm not.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.600
He may be able to help us
get a bigger fish.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.341
Really? Like how big?

13:40.384 --> 13:42.038
Jose Rojas big.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.084
Does this mean you're gonna be

13:44.127 --> 13:45.476
making more deals with Delgado?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.237
Let us see what he's willing
to give up first.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.871
How about just tell us
why Delgado's wife

13:48.915 --> 13:50.090
was targeted first.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.223
Probably the same reason
they targeted yours.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.399
Why don't we go ask him.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.489
Great.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.318
Ooh, Detective Reagan.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.800
I'll catch up.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.456
They said it would be okay
if I came up to say hello.

14:08.499 --> 14:11.676
Hello. Anything else
I can help you with?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.896
Actually, I'm the one helping.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.247
The department asked me
to work with the Cold Case Squad

14:17.291 --> 14:19.423
on a child murdered
back in 1996.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.469
Nice. I didn't know you
did that kind of thing.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.428
I took a detour

14:24.472 --> 14:27.301
because I wanted to see
how things were going with you.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.999
They're going good. In fact,
I'm working a case right now.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.281
I really need to get back to it.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.567
Your wife's murder case.

14:34.177 --> 14:38.442
Sorry. Occupational hazard.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.880
It's all good.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.884
Okay, but,
you need to be careful.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.102
I'm always careful.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.409
Extra careful.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.412
The people that you are
going after...

14:51.455 --> 14:54.154
They're incredibly dangerous.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.203
Occupational hazard, right?

15:11.606 --> 15:14.261
He'll only talk to you.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.711
She spoke to you on the phone.
What did she say?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.278
She was scared.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.411
She knew it was
coming, I'm sure.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.586
She's married to you.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.893
Collateral damage.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.331
Just like your wife.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.421
Wasn't your wife also killed

15:44.465 --> 15:46.380
because of what you do
for a living?

15:46.423 --> 15:48.382
I'm not trying to rile you.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.600
We have something in common.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.214
We both want Jose Rojas.

15:54.257 --> 15:58.392
He's responsible for
the murder of my wife.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.871
And of yours.

15:59.915 --> 16:03.005
Keep talking.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.051
They call him "the clam"
because he never talks.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.878
No one who works for him
talks either.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.230
What are you trying to say?

16:10.273 --> 16:13.581
I'm saying I'm willing
to be the first.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.627
Or you hope
I'm willing to make a deal.

16:16.671 --> 16:20.544
No. I just want
to bring him down.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.329
But I'll only work with you.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.461
Why?

16:24.505 --> 16:27.029
Because we're not so different.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.519
Maybe you can track down
the security video,

16:38.562 --> 16:39.887
and we'll just have to
go through the...

16:39.911 --> 16:42.566
Mark Sanzo was released?
Confession was thrown out.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.915
What are you talking about?

16:43.959 --> 16:46.396
Blood alcohol was, 12.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.658
He was legally drunk.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.704
Judge decided
there was no way that Sanzo

16:49.747 --> 16:52.054
could have knowingly
waived his Miranda rights.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.162
He was able to
follow directions.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.796
He wasn't slurring
his words, Erin.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.407
Even if the confession wasn't
thrown out, his lawyer would've

16:57.451 --> 17:00.019
eviscerated us on the stand.
There was no murder weapon,

17:00.062 --> 17:02.412
no security video
and no eyewitness.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.066
And no corroborating evidence.

17:04.109 --> 17:06.068
Except that he bragged
that he did it.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.376
Why'd you even allow the blood alcohol?
Why would I object to it?

17:09.419 --> 17:11.049
Because you know where
she's going with that.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.424
Jamie, the job of a prosecutor
is to find the truth.

17:14.468 --> 17:18.124
Exactly. And the truth is that
Sanzo killed Stephen Campbell.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.994
Why are you taking this
so personally?

17:20.039 --> 17:23.303
The guy told me to my face...
To my face, Erin...

17:23.346 --> 17:24.739
That he killed Stephen Campbell.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.151
Now you're gonna
stand here and tell me

17:26.175 --> 17:27.436
that doesn't matter?

17:27.481 --> 17:29.241
That we're just supposed
to let this guy walk?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.788
That's how it works, Jamie. That's it?

17:30.832 --> 17:32.834
That's all you got for me,
"That's how it works"?

17:32.877 --> 17:34.401
Well, if we can't put a guy away

17:34.444 --> 17:36.185
who admits that
he killed someone,

17:36.229 --> 17:38.187
then it doesn't work at all!

17:38.231 --> 17:39.884
Why am I taking this
so personally?

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
The better question
is why you're not.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.636
Hey, it's me, Luis.
I need to meet.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.160
I have some information

17:54.203 --> 17:56.684
about a DEA takedown.

17:56.727 --> 17:59.121
No, no, not-not over the phone.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.688
I want to do it in person.

18:00.731 --> 18:01.689
Yeah, okay, at the club.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.732
I'll be there.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.610
Can you get a location?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.718
Yeah. According to this,
the middle of the East River.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.502
We're really gonna take
a chance on this guy?

18:13.527 --> 18:15.746
He's gonna take off again
like he did last time.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.270
- Yes, we are.
- He'll be wired.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.054
We'll be sitting on the place.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.163
No, I can't be wired. That's
the first thing he'll look for.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.338
That's why we're gonna
modify your phone.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.319
It'll act as the wire.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.755
When things start to go south,

18:24.799 --> 18:26.061
we'll have an agreed upon word

18:26.105 --> 18:28.585
that you can just... Ponche.

18:28.629 --> 18:29.412
"Ponche."

18:29.456 --> 18:31.066
That's your safe word?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.242
What's it mean? It's a drink.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.288
"It's a drink."
You expect me to believe that?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.596
Listen to me.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.860
If this is another one
of your setups, I swear...

18:42.904 --> 18:45.472
If he says it's a drink,
it's a drink.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.867
It's time to go.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.531
Okay, who's saying grace? Jamie.

19:01.575 --> 19:04.186
Not feeling
so grateful today, Pop.Nonsense.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.319
You've got every reason
in the world to be grateful.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.861
Except for having to tell
a young woman

19:07.885 --> 19:09.670
that her fiancé
was murdered in a bar fight

19:09.713 --> 19:11.865
and the guy who confessed to it
is still walking around.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.171
You really gonna
do this right now?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.892
- Yeah.
- Wait.

19:14.936 --> 19:17.286
It's because of her
that your perp got bail?

19:17.330 --> 19:19.506
He didn't get bail;
The charges were dismissed.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.986
And we can bring charges
again once we have some

19:22.030 --> 19:24.772
actual evidence to prove the
case beyond a reasonable doubt.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.774
You mean, more than a confession?
Since when

19:26.817 --> 19:28.210
does a confession matter to her?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.386
Come on, Danny. Well, Dad, I'm
just saying

19:30.430 --> 19:33.259
that, you know, how many times
have I had to argue with her

19:33.302 --> 19:35.217
about the legal technicalities

19:35.261 --> 19:37.176
of a case that allowed
one of my perps to walk,

19:37.219 --> 19:39.395
and Harvard over here
has taken her side

19:39.439 --> 19:41.223
about the law every single time.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.094
I understand the law,
but ADAs have

19:43.138 --> 19:45.247
at their discretion to
take a cop at their word. DANNY

19:45.271 --> 19:46.900
This isn't about taking
your word. It's about facts.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.230
The dinner table

19:48.274 --> 19:51.407
is meant to be
a demilitarized zone.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.453
Really? I mean,
it never feels like that.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.237
What? You think
they argue too much?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
No, I just mean
that you guys are not shy

19:57.283 --> 19:58.719
about disagreeing, at all.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.808
Well, you assume your family's
gonna have your back.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.723
And you're right to assume that.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.160
Maybe, but sometimes your family
can work against you.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.161
Exactly.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.815
Really? I didn't mean you.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.686
I was talking about me.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.993
Your family doesn't like you?

20:12.036 --> 20:12.994
They love me,

20:13.037 --> 20:14.256
but it's complicated.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.693
I get that.
Family can be embarrassing.

20:16.737 --> 20:17.955
Excuse me?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.957
Like when your dad
gets into it with a guy

20:20.001 --> 20:22.264
and that guy turns out to
be your crush's father.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.526
Or your mom shows up

20:23.570 --> 20:25.441
to your apartment unannounced.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.051
Or you get arrested for truancy

20:27.095 --> 20:29.750
and your dad tells the cops
to keep you in a holding cell.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.621
Hey, you never
did it again, did you?

20:31.665 --> 20:32.927
Or you got to go back

20:32.970 --> 20:33.991
to your precinct,
tell everyone that your sister

20:34.015 --> 20:35.451
threw out your confession.

20:35.495 --> 20:36.974
The judge threw it out;
I didn't.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.194
I can't believe I have
to explain this to my brother

20:39.238 --> 20:41.109
who has a law degree.Please.
Please, please.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.198
Can we argue or disagree
or whatever it is

20:43.242 --> 20:44.286
you're gonna call it

20:44.330 --> 20:45.722
after we say grace?

20:45.766 --> 20:47.289
Yeah, I'm starving.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.117
Bless us, Lord,

20:49.160 --> 20:50.858
and these Thy gifts

20:50.901 --> 20:52.401
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty

20:52.425 --> 20:54.253
through Christ, our Lord.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.820
Amen.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.242
So you've been working here a couple
of years now? Yeah, about that.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
Have you ever gotten any
complaints from, tenants?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.792
Only complaints I hear
are from one tenant. Janko.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.186
Lena Janko? Could there be more than one?

21:15.230 --> 21:16.666
Pain in the ass?

21:16.710 --> 21:18.340
Some of the other tenants
found out she was married

21:18.364 --> 21:20.409
to that shyster,
and they weren't happy about it.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.064
How's that? Somebody
spray-painted her door.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.458
Wrote the word "bitch" on it.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.982
Do you know who did that?
You guys must have cameras.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.810
I'm Anna Goodman.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.072
I'm on the board.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.354
Is there something
I can do to help?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.988
They were asking
about Lena Janko.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.337
What'd she do now?

21:35.381 --> 21:37.165
What do you mean?
She's done something wrong?

21:37.208 --> 21:39.036
Maybe you should start
with how she used

21:39.080 --> 21:41.082
her maiden name
to get board approval.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.344
And then she moves in

21:42.388 --> 21:44.694
and we find out
she's basically Ruth Madoff.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.436
We're not here
to investigate Mrs. Janko.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.656
The only thing I know
is that my husband and I

21:49.699 --> 21:51.527
lost a quarter
of a million dollars

21:51.571 --> 21:53.921
because of her financial fraud.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.619
Wasn't it her husband
who was indicted? As far as I'm concerned,

21:56.663 --> 21:59.927
that bitch should be
in a cell right next to him.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.363
Excuse me.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.713
Gentlemen.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.715
Thank you.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.500
Looks like
we might not even need

22:07.543 --> 22:10.807
to see the security footage.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.421
Hey, Sarge, you got a minute?

22:15.464 --> 22:17.248
Kind of busy, Anthony.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.729
You know, you were way
out of line with Erin.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.078
You're out of line right now.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.186
Yeah, you think
she wants to have

22:22.210 --> 22:23.733
a murderer out
there walking free

22:23.777 --> 22:25.169
any more than you do?!

22:25.213 --> 22:27.322
Hey, Anthony, do me a favor.
Don't come in my precinct

22:27.346 --> 22:28.999
and try to school me
about my sister.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.001
Yeah, well, then get your head
out of your ass!

22:31.045 --> 22:32.829
I got work to do.

22:35.310 --> 22:38.139
I'm gonna need copies
of your memo book pages.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.099
Front and back.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.321
Fine.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.412
And can you make sure these...

22:50.456 --> 22:52.109
these are the names
of all the people

22:52.153 --> 22:54.155
that were in the bar that night?

22:58.028 --> 23:00.379
Looks like everybody
that was there when we arrived.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.032
Anybody in particular stand out?

23:02.076 --> 23:04.513
Anybody we should be
concentrating on?

23:04.557 --> 23:06.167
Brianna Cabello.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.909
She's not a finance wiz,
more of a hanger-on.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.345
She say anything?

23:10.389 --> 23:13.783
No. Just, a gut instinct.

23:15.785 --> 23:19.223
You should understand that,
since yours is big enough.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.796
The Boy Scout's
got some spunk after all.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.016
We done here? We're not.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.583
You want to help me lean on her?

23:30.626 --> 23:33.803
Maybe we could find
another way to get Sanzo.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.632
Hell yeah.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.261
Twice in one week.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.133
I'm starting to feel special.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.135
Good.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.963
So, Lena.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.660
Yes, Francis?

24:04.704 --> 24:08.621
There was an assault
on a woman in your building.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.711
And that same woman had graffiti

24:11.754 --> 24:13.930
spray-painted on her door.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.019
So, what...

24:16.063 --> 24:19.109
I'm hoping to get from you

24:19.153 --> 24:23.940
is why that woman didn't file
a police report either time.

24:23.984 --> 24:27.596
Maybe she was hoping
it would go away on its own.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.381
Or...

24:30.425 --> 24:34.342
sometimes victims don't want
friends and family to know.

24:35.430 --> 24:38.259
I understand
that need for privacy.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.956
I hope you do, too.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.393
I like to think I do.

24:44.874 --> 24:48.530
Lena, you have moved four times
in the last five years.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.621
You've been checking up on me.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.102
Well, kind of.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.499
I'm married to a man who's made

25:00.542 --> 25:03.327
many people's lives
a living hell.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.461
So it follows
that a lot of people

25:06.505 --> 25:09.203
wouldn't mind seeing me suffer.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.553
So you move
instead of fighting back,

25:11.597 --> 25:14.034
instead of letting Eddie know
what's really going on?

25:14.077 --> 25:15.209
Edit.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.210
Edit.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.559
You wouldn't understand.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.605
Try me.

25:21.215 --> 25:24.827
Edit and I were both blindsided
by my husband's crimes.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.787
But the worst part

25:27.830 --> 25:31.312
was when the case
was made public.

25:33.314 --> 25:36.796
I couldn't protect her.

25:36.839 --> 25:41.017
That hurt me more
than anything Armin ever did.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.456
I'm sure, as a parent,
you must understand.

25:48.721 --> 25:52.202
I don't want
to shame her anymore.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.162
Fighting back
isn't shaming anyone.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.033
Well, of course I would
expect that from you.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.469
You're a Reagan.

26:00.341 --> 26:03.213
You know...

26:03.257 --> 26:06.390
it's not easy
competing with your family.

26:08.697 --> 26:13.093
Maybe... the mistake
is thinking you have to.

26:18.098 --> 26:22.145
You need to file a complaint
against the person who did this.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.234
If I do that,

26:24.278 --> 26:26.933
the entire building
will be against me.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.674
You know,

26:28.717 --> 26:31.851
it has been my experience
that, if you do that,

26:31.894 --> 26:34.375
the whole building
will gain respect for you.

26:36.159 --> 26:39.423
Well, that's easy to say...

26:39.467 --> 26:43.210
coming from
a police commissioner.

26:43.253 --> 26:47.344
I don't have
the entire NYPD behind me.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.739
Yeah, you do.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.707
Brianna Cabello.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.318
Investigator Abetemarco from
the district attorney's office.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.363
I think you know this guy.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.715
Nice getup. You ever hear
of performance art?

27:09.758 --> 27:11.542
Ever hear
of hindering prosecution?

27:11.586 --> 27:13.414
I already gave a statement.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.329
That was before
Stephen Campbell died.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.939
The charge is now murder.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.202
I don't have
anything more to say.

27:19.246 --> 27:22.815
Okay, so can you sign something
to that effect?

27:22.858 --> 27:24.077
Just a formality, really.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.166
If you put down
that you didn't see anything

27:26.209 --> 27:27.733
and then sign at the bottom.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.432
Should we tell her? No.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.434
W-Wait, tell me what? Nothing, just that,

27:33.477 --> 27:35.610
well, we watched the video.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.133
Wait, wait, what video?

27:37.177 --> 27:39.701
The hidden camera
behind the cash register.

27:39.745 --> 27:40.702
The owner uses it

27:40.746 --> 27:42.008
to spy on his employees.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.400
If you could just write down

27:43.444 --> 27:45.533
that you didn't see anything,
then sign it.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.884
Mark would never
intentionally kill anyone.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.713
Well, he can explain
that it was an accident.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.584
Maybe the D.A.
would reduce the charges.

27:53.628 --> 27:54.890
Did Mark Sanzo

27:54.934 --> 27:56.849
stab Stephen Campbell
during that bar fight?

27:57.893 --> 28:00.809
Did he stab him?! What did
he do with the knife?!

28:02.202 --> 28:05.727
He gave it to the bartender,
Mike, before the cops arrived.

28:08.556 --> 28:11.385
Wait, wait.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.387
There is no video, is there?

28:13.430 --> 28:14.605
No.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.309
Detective Baez and Agent Wise

28:22.352 --> 28:23.702
will be watching from the truck.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.313
I'll be watching
from the corner. I know the drill.

28:26.356 --> 28:29.751
Then you realize that Rojas may
suspect that you're cooperating.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.101
In which case,
you're talking to a dead man.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.450
Doesn't really matter.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.235
It'll matter to your boys.

28:35.278 --> 28:38.151
If you gave me a gun, I could
shoot Rojas when he came in.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.414
If you suspect
that it's a setup,

28:40.457 --> 28:42.111
use your safe word, "poncho..."

28:42.155 --> 28:43.765
Ponche.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.289
Your wife's favorite drink.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.465
She discovered it
on our honeymoon.

28:48.509 --> 28:52.426
So I never knew if she liked it
for the taste or...

28:52.469 --> 28:53.906
for the memories.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.170
21-15, are we a go? Good to go up here.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.828
Telling me to go
screw myself in Spanish?

29:05.047 --> 29:08.747
It means "put a good face
to the bad times." See?

29:11.967 --> 29:14.448
Good luck.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.413
Look...

29:23.457 --> 29:25.851
your brother didn't need
any convincing

29:25.894 --> 29:27.287
to work with the DEA.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.594
He came to us,
asking to work as a CI.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.642
Everybody loves a hero.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.854
Sorry to hear about your wife.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.248
Heard it was a break-in.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.945
I think it's someone
who knows us.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.077
Yeah? Like who?

30:18.120 --> 30:20.079
I'll figure it out
one way or the other.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.602
You know me.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.083
Yeah.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.172
About 30 years now?
DELGADO Since back when

30:26.215 --> 30:28.304
we were both begging
in the streets in Chiapas.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.132
We had each other's backs then.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.918
Now you got my back again?

30:32.961 --> 30:36.747
The DEA is planning a raid on
your stash house in the Bronx.

30:36.791 --> 30:37.966
How you know that?

30:38.010 --> 30:39.141
We've been made.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.883
Just give it another second.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.102
I hear things.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.494
I hear things, too.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.584
Like you cooperating
to make a deal.

30:47.628 --> 30:50.805
You think the DEA is gonna offer
a deal to someone like me?

30:54.940 --> 30:57.943
The wire dropped out.
What happened?

30:57.986 --> 30:59.901
Get him back.

30:59.945 --> 31:03.426
What's a cop doing sitting
outside watching the club?

31:03.470 --> 31:04.601
What are you talking about?

31:04.645 --> 31:07.474
Unmarked car on the corner.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.519
It won't be unmarked for long.

31:15.395 --> 31:18.267
Reagan, get down!

31:19.225 --> 31:21.444
Get down! Shots fired!

31:23.533 --> 31:25.231
Get down!

31:26.841 --> 31:27.886
Drop it! Drop it!

31:36.677 --> 31:39.288
Stay right there.
You wait for backup.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.341
Police! Get out of the way!

31:48.384 --> 31:49.429
Move!

31:50.430 --> 31:52.040
- Police!
- Whoa!

31:52.084 --> 31:53.215
Where'd they go?

31:53.259 --> 31:55.914
Get out of here. Go! Get out!

32:58.019 --> 32:59.934
Police!

32:59.978 --> 33:00.979
Drop it!

33:02.589 --> 33:05.679
Shoot through me! Kill me!
I don't care! Just kill him!

33:05.722 --> 33:07.724
Just kill him!

33:07.768 --> 33:10.031
Shut up!

33:10.075 --> 33:11.598
Just shoot him!

33:11.641 --> 33:14.296
Just shoot through me and kill
me! I don't care! Shoot him!

33:14.340 --> 33:16.211
Let him go.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.650
Let him go right now! You won't shoot me!

33:20.694 --> 33:23.131
Let him go, or I swear to God
I'll blow your head off.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.177
Right now!

33:28.658 --> 33:29.853
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.226
Shoot him!

33:31.270 --> 33:32.445
Nobody will know!

33:32.488 --> 33:34.055
Reagan, he ordered

33:34.099 --> 33:35.535
your wife to be killed.

33:35.578 --> 33:36.753
You won't do it.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.496
Do it!

33:42.542 --> 33:43.586
Danny?

33:45.414 --> 33:47.851
Danny. You okay?

33:54.206 --> 33:55.511
Cuff him.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.653
Get him out of here.

34:30.893 --> 34:32.766
We got the murder weapon.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.074
It's being tested for DNA,
but the latent prints confirm

34:37.118 --> 34:39.380
that it's Mark's fingerprints
on the knife.

34:39.425 --> 34:42.514
That's great.Now...

34:42.558 --> 34:45.039
both you guys need
to change the playbook.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.388
What's that supposed to mean?

34:46.431 --> 34:48.172
Means that you always
dig your heels in

34:48.216 --> 34:51.045
and insist that you're right

34:51.089 --> 34:53.091
and never want to hear
the other side.

34:54.527 --> 34:58.139
And, you, I got why this case

34:58.183 --> 35:01.447
got under your skin, but you
can't come in with guns blazing,

35:01.490 --> 35:04.624
no respect for the D.A.'s office
and Erin's position in it.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.974
Neither side
listens to the other.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.460
So...

35:16.462 --> 35:18.290
you need to talk it out,

35:18.333 --> 35:19.378
and you'll realize

35:19.421 --> 35:22.555
that both of you were wrong.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.125
Good luck...

35:30.824 --> 35:32.608
and good night.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.704
And remember
to turn off the lights.

35:41.748 --> 35:44.751
Come on. I'll buy
you a real drink.

35:56.589 --> 35:57.981
Why'd you warn me?

35:58.025 --> 36:00.419
I didn't want Rojas to win.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.510
Why didn't you shoot him?

36:04.553 --> 36:06.903
Because Rojas didn't win.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.691
He gave up,

36:11.734 --> 36:14.041
and as much as I wanted
to shoot that son of a bitch,

36:14.084 --> 36:17.218
if I did, it would've been
murder, so...

36:17.262 --> 36:20.961
He murdered my wife.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.615
He murdered yours.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.705
I would've shot him.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.620
That's why I couldn't.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.815
I hope that consoles you
when you're watching the trial

36:29.839 --> 36:32.538
and all his high-priced lawyers
paint him as the victim.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.409
He'll never get out of prison.

36:34.453 --> 36:38.457
You have a lot
of faith in the system.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.593
My boys will be men
when I get out.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.643
I hope they turn out like you.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.429
Thank you.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.910
But I hope they look like me,
'cause I'm better looking.

37:02.089 --> 37:05.962
When I come out, my boys will
have nothing in common with me.

37:06.006 --> 37:10.750
Yeah, I could check in on them,
every now and again,

37:10.793 --> 37:13.622
make sure they're on
the straight and narrow,

37:13.666 --> 37:16.625
they're safe.

37:16.669 --> 37:18.497
If you want.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.241
I'd be grateful for that.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.158
Hey, Reagan.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.986
Yeah.

37:30.030 --> 37:33.163
I'm sorry about your wife.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.736
I'm sorry about your wife, too.

37:57.231 --> 38:00.669
Okay. How's it going?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.671
We got our guy.

38:02.715 --> 38:05.761
That's not what
I'm talking about.

38:05.805 --> 38:09.591
Look, she and I have been
butting heads, too, lately.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.593
It's... it's her new job.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.465
It's gonna happen.

38:13.508 --> 38:16.381
We had a drink.
We talked it out.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.905
All good?

38:19.949 --> 38:21.516
All good.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.213
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.345
Hey. Hey.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.912
Hi.

38:25.955 --> 38:28.218
Sorry we're a little late.
No, it's my fault, really.

38:28.262 --> 38:30.656
Um, there was an incident
in my building.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.658
The president of the board
was arrested.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.705
Everything okay now? Yes.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.620
I-I think it will be.

38:41.362 --> 38:46.367
Anyway, I would like
to introduce you to my mom.

38:48.195 --> 38:50.240
Well.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.158
Nice to finally meet you.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.551
Frank.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.118
Lena.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.396
Hey.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.876
Hey.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.837
All good?

39:26.015 --> 39:28.017
All good.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.638
Hi.

39:39.681 --> 39:43.032
I'd tell you I just happened
to be in the neighborhood,

39:43.076 --> 39:46.209
but you'd probably know
that I was lying, so...

39:46.253 --> 39:48.386
Um, come in.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.173
Um... have a seat.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.003
Can I make you some tea?

39:57.046 --> 39:59.222
No. Thanks.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.791
You know...

40:05.054 --> 40:07.317
my gift is not contagious.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.319
I know.

40:09.363 --> 40:13.106
If I was scared of that, I
promise you I wouldn't be here.

40:16.805 --> 40:20.766
I, arrested the guy
who murdered my wife.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.333
God.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.466
I am...

40:25.510 --> 40:27.555
I'm so happy to hear that.

40:27.599 --> 40:31.124
Yeah. He'll be going away
for a very long time.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.518
I like to tell people,

40:33.561 --> 40:37.826
when they lose someone
extremely important to them,

40:37.870 --> 40:42.309
that you'll really
never get over it.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.834
Gee, thanks.

40:45.878 --> 40:50.839
You don't get over it,
but you do get through it.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.189
And the only way to get
through it is to stop

40:53.233 --> 40:58.847
focusing on what you don't have,
and focus on what you do have.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.508
You still wear
your wedding ring.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.599
Yeah, it's a...

41:13.993 --> 41:16.430
symbol of a promise I made.

41:16.474 --> 41:21.479
She knows that you kept
that promise when she was alive.

41:21.522 --> 41:24.960
And she told you this?

41:25.004 --> 41:28.398
No. I'mtelling you.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.969
You need to let her go.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.528
It's okay.
