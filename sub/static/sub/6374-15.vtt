00:01.862 --> 00:04.269
charlie, I didn't even know you were in town.

00:04.269 --> 00:05.238
Do you remember how you felt watching me

00:05.238 --> 00:06.315
hit on all those women?

00:06.315 --> 00:09.206
That's how I feel every time I see gio around you.

00:09.206 --> 00:10.613
I hate that you feel that way.

00:10.613 --> 00:11.941
I just won't see him anymore.

00:11.941 --> 00:13.300
Betty!

00:13.828 --> 00:15.113
Want a ride?

00:15.113 --> 00:17.050
I'm here to warn you about renee.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.641
I don't believe anything you have to say.

00:18.691 --> 00:20.425
Why are you trying to break up me and daniel?

00:20.425 --> 00:21.816
Renee, we both know what happens to you

00:21.816 --> 00:23.675
when things get too serious with men.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.363
(Renee) this is nothing like stony brook.

00:25.363 --> 00:26.863
I had a breakdown.

00:27.050 --> 00:28.113
I take these.

00:28.113 --> 00:29.612
(Wilhelmina) good job, marc.

00:29.612 --> 00:30.925
Those pills are all that stand

00:30.925 --> 00:33.050
between my sister and the nuthouse.

00:33.488 --> 00:36.800
 No candles... ever.

00:38.784 --> 00:40.253
it's 2:00 in the morning.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.300
That gives us five hours till your next meeting.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.988
(Daniel) how can you sound so chipper?

00:44.988 --> 00:47.613
We've been up till 2:00 A.M.
For the last five nights.

00:47.613 --> 00:48.675
I can barely think.

00:48.675 --> 00:50.487
Well, I have to be chipper enough for the both of us.

00:50.487 --> 00:52.425
And besides, past midnight,

00:52.425 --> 00:54.175
"mode" pays to send me home in a town car,

00:54.175 --> 00:54.999
which is pretty cool.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.409
Do you know they have free btles of water?

00:56.409 --> 00:57.987
Yes, and a minibar.

00:57.987 --> 01:01.425
Don't touch that. Daniel,I need you sharp at 7:00 A.M.

01:01.425 --> 01:02.175
oh, hold on.

01:02.175 --> 01:02.831
I have another call.

01:02.831 --> 01:04.050
Go ahead.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.112
Betty!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.237
Daniel isn't home yet,and I'm worried.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.628
Hi, renee.

01:11.628 --> 01:13.987
Uh, yeah, his meeting went really late,

01:13.987 --> 01:15.691
but I have him on the other line right now.

01:15.691 --> 01:17.237
Oh, thank god.

01:17.237 --> 01:18.128
Put me through.

01:18.128 --> 01:20.753
I just have to go over his schedule for tomorrow first.

01:20.753 --> 01:21.769
Betty, please.

01:21.769 --> 01:23.300
I really need to talk to him.

01:24.063 --> 01:26.425
Okay. All right.

01:27.925 --> 01:30.238
daniel, uh, you have renee on the line.

01:30.238 --> 01:30.863
Hey, baby.

01:30.863 --> 01:32.300
Hi, sexy.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.863
I'm just lying on the bed...

01:33.863 --> 01:35.550
all alone.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.753
Are you wearing those new panties I got you?

01:37.753 --> 01:38.999
Not anymore.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.738
No--oh. Oh.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.112
women don't really do this,do they?

01:49.112 --> 01:50.894
Yes, they do,

01:50.894 --> 01:52.925
and they're usually wearing bikinis and covered in mud.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.550
Really?

01:54.550 --> 01:56.519
Hi, I'm calling from hilda's beautilities

01:56.519 --> 01:59.925
with a glamour opportunity or...

01:59.925 --> 02:02.300
a glamour-tunity!

02:02.300 --> 02:04.050
Hello? Hello?

02:04.050 --> 02:05.565
how manyalls is that?

02:05.565 --> 02:09.238
15. I guess people in queens just don't care about beauty.

02:09.238 --> 02:12.112
I need 30 sandwiches before the editorial meeting,

02:12.112 --> 02:13.999
or people will forget to eat again,

02:13.999 --> 02:16.691
and daniel doesn't want anyone passing out like last year.

02:16.691 --> 02:17.800
Excuse me.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.050
Thank you, gio.You're the best.

02:20.050 --> 02:21.268
No, you are.

02:21.268 --> 02:24.238
No, you arE.You are.

02:24.238 --> 02:25.175
Okay, okay, okay.

02:25.175 --> 02:27.378
I-I'm hanging up now. Bye.

02:27.550 --> 02:30.253
I barely got any sleep last night. I'm a wreck.

02:30.253 --> 02:32.988
Daniel's been keeping you late every night this weeK.

02:32.988 --> 02:35.987
Yeah, but I spent half the night dealing with his girlfriend.

02:35.987 --> 02:37.999
So wait, she just calls you in the middle of the night?

02:37.999 --> 02:40.925
No, no, first she calls,then she texts.

02:40.925 --> 02:42.566
It's been going on for, like, a week.

02:42.566 --> 02:44.503
It's definitely getting in the way of my work.

02:44.503 --> 02:47.175
Let's not let your hair get in the way, too, huh?

02:47.175 --> 02:50.690
I can have this hot mess fixed in two minutes.

02:51.987 --> 02:54.625
So what's going on with you and gio?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.363
I heard you guys on the phone.

02:56.363 --> 02:57.862
It's nothing.

02:59.253 --> 03:01.863
So... okay, gio and I are friends again. So what?

03:01.863 --> 03:04.394
 So... wasn't henry jealous of you guys?

03:04.394 --> 03:11.113
(Sighs) yeah, he is,but henry doesn't know that I am talking to gio again.

03:11.113 --> 03:13.550
Ooh, drama.

03:13.550 --> 03:15.300
Tell mama hilda everything.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.800
"Mama hilda"?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.999
I'm trying it out.

03:18.503 --> 03:20.800
Look, gio is a great guy,

03:20.800 --> 03:23.488
and I wanna be his friend,and I don't wanna upset henry.

03:23.488 --> 03:26.175
I mean, he has been so swe since charlie showed up.

03:26.175 --> 03:28.675
Yeah, but are you sure hiding things from him--

03:28.675 --> 03:30.613
that's the best thing for your relationship?

03:30.613 --> 03:33.815
Yes.And besides, charlie is leaving for tucson...

03:33.815 --> 03:35.315
 today! 

03:35.315 --> 03:38.612
And I want my last four weeks with henry to be stress-free.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.878
Oh, I gotta go.Don't wait up!

03:40.878 --> 03:41.675
All right.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.191
Just got a call--

03:44.191 --> 03:45.862
your first appointment.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.487
Let me see. Let meee.

03:48.565 --> 03:49.425
Is this a joke?

03:49.425 --> 03:50.800
This says "gina gambarro."

03:50.800 --> 03:51.862
So I thought you guys made up.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.191
We did... till we didn'T.

03:54.191 --> 03:57.612
I might have called her a skank to a few people.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.175
Well, she is!

03:59.175 --> 04:00.613
Well, apparently she forgives you,

04:00.613 --> 04:02.644
because she wants a manicure.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.863
Mom, don't we need the business...

04:06.613 --> 04:09.316
even skanky business?

04:13.875 --> 04:15.362
Oh, daniel.

04:15.362 --> 04:18.988
Good morning. Coffee,your notes for your advertising meeting,

04:18.988 --> 04:20.565
rachel zoe got pushed to 11:00,

04:20.565 --> 04:22.378
and if you rush back after lunch,

04:22.378 --> 04:23.675
I'm hang curtains put in your office

04:23.675 --> 04:26.941
so you can nap between 2:00 and 2:45, right before christian siriano.

04:26.941 --> 04:28.363
You scheduled a nap for me?

04:28.363 --> 04:29.816
I need you at your best.

04:29.816 --> 04:30.675
Oh, I love you.

04:30.675 --> 04:31.925
I know. (Sniffs)

04:31.925 --> 04:32.999
mmm. You sme good.

04:32.999 --> 04:35.425
Oh, it's viktor & rolf,gift from renee.

04:35.425 --> 04:37.550
You know, she's always doing little things for me.

04:37.550 --> 04:37.863
Yeah.

04:37.863 --> 04:40.128
Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

04:40.128 --> 04:43.753
Renee keeps calling me  to schedule fun things for you two to do together.

04:43.753 --> 04:44.237
See? That's what I mean.

04:44.237 --> 04:45.425
She's thoughtful.

04:45.425 --> 04:49.363
Yes, but have you taken a look at how packed your schedule is this week?

04:49.363 --> 04:50.159
D you make that?

04:50.159 --> 04:52.362
Mm. I have a system.

04:52.362 --> 04:55.800
Thing is, she gets mad  every time I tell her

04:55.800 --> 05:00.425
that you obviously don't have time for a cooking class or dinner at lupa.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.941
I know it's a busy week, betty, but I really like this girl.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.300
Can you try and work things out?

05:08.687 --> 05:10.612
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

05:10.612 --> 05:11.925
Thank you.

05:18.425 --> 05:20.363
hi, renee.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.300
I'm just concerned,dr. Remus.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.925
Renee's behavior this past week has been so erratic.

05:26.925 --> 05:31.613
Is it possible her medication's not working anymore,

05:31.613 --> 05:33.613
or perhaps she stopped taking her pills?

05:33.613 --> 05:35.362
Well, it's possible,but it would take some--

05:35.362 --> 05:39.175
well, what symptoms might I look for to know if she's backsliding?

05:39.175 --> 05:42.925
Well, your sister has struggled for years with issues of paranoia...

05:42.925 --> 05:44.925
what do you mean he's in a meeting?

05:44.925 --> 05:46.300
Well, who's he meeting with?

05:46.300 --> 05:47.191
Is he trying to avoid me?

05:47.191 --> 05:48.675
No. Why would you even say that?

05:48.675 --> 05:53.200
Probably coinciding with a rise in irrational,jealous behavior...

05:53.238 --> 05:56.191
I know you can't tell me if there's somebody else.

05:56.191 --> 05:57.316
You didn't say anything.

05:57.316 --> 05:57.988
There is someone, isn't there?

05:57.988 --> 06:00.394
Renee, you didn't even give me a chance to speak.

06:00.394 --> 06:04.112
As well, I'd expect you might encounter severe mood swings...

06:04.112 --> 06:06.237
no, his afternoon cannot be booked up,

06:06.237 --> 06:10.362
because I scheduled his and her massages for us today at bliss.

06:10.362 --> 06:11.550
The weekend would be better.

06:11.550 --> 06:12.999
Bliss!

06:12.999 --> 06:16.347
Usually followed by some kind of emotional crash.

06:16.347 --> 06:18.362
Are you... crying?

06:18.362 --> 06:19.675
(Crying) no. No.

06:19.675 --> 06:27.050
I hesitate to even bring this up,but is there a time we should consider...

06:27.050 --> 06:30.363
committing my poor sister?

06:31.500 --> 06:32.753
We have a lot of work to do.

06:32.753 --> 06:34.675
Oh, that's what that means.

06:34.675 --> 06:37.754
It's funny how you take away the tiny movements that create wrinkles and suddenly...

06:37.754 --> 06:38.425
(singsongy) poker face.

06:38.425 --> 06:39.999
Oh, let's get serious, marc.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.659
Right now we only have one problem--

06:41.659 --> 06:44.862
dr. Facial hair in there says he won't commit renee

06:44.862 --> 06:47.999
until she is a danger to herself or others.

06:47.999 --> 06:50.737
(Normal voice) danger? We don't want to hurt anyone, do we?

06:50.737 --> 06:52.999
Of course not, but the sooner this is over with, the better.

06:52.999 --> 06:53.691
Well...

06:53.691 --> 06:55.800
and your future's at stake, too, marc.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.441
Renee knows about bradford's baby

06:57.441 --> 07:00.999
and could expose our less-than-legal method of procuring a donor.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.706
Well, I switched the pills about a week ago,

07:02.706 --> 07:04.707
so the crazy train should be arriving

07:04.707 --> 07:06.987
at gare du renee  about, well, now.

07:06.987 --> 07:10.362
Okay, well, if it doesn't,I'm gonna have to give her a little push.

07:10.362 --> 07:14.629
Schedule a lunch today with my sister at la brulee...

07:14.629 --> 07:15.800
consider it lunched.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.362
Then go back to my place and keep an eye on christina.

07:18.362 --> 07:19.050
Ugh. But she scares me.

07:19.050 --> 07:20.582
She's so cranky all the time.

07:20.582 --> 07:21.878
Well, then pamper her.

07:21.878 --> 07:23.441
Let's not forget...

07:23.441 --> 07:25.909
that walking womb is carrying my heir.

07:25.909 --> 07:27.175
Oh, don't pout.

07:27.175 --> 07:28.925
You haven't the lips for it.

07:33.237 --> 07:34.737
I mean,I know I promised daniel

07:34.737 --> 07:36.315
I would try and get along with her,

07:36.315 --> 07:38.362
but it's gotten worse today.

07:38.362 --> 07:40.050
Renee is driving me nuts.

07:40.050 --> 07:42.425
Hey, just 'cause you promised you'd be nice

07:42.425 --> 07:44.675
doesn't mean you let renee walk all over you.

07:44.675 --> 07:47.379
Next time she crosses the line, say something.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.550
Oh, uh, well,

07:48.550 --> 07:50.050
it looks like we're all set here with the sandwiches.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.894
Thank you, gio. Bye.

07:57.050 --> 07:57.987
Hi.

07:57.987 --> 07:59.753
Uh, hey. Was that gio?

07:59.753 --> 08:01.987
What? Oh, yeah.

08:01.987 --> 08:03.999
He was dropping off sandwiches or something.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.550
Hey, listen, why don't we celebrate tonight?

08:06.550 --> 08:09.316
You and I should find a place to have dinner at.

08:09.769 --> 08:11.500
Betty, I have to tell you something.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.050
It's about charlie.

08:15.456 --> 08:18.362
Can I pretend for one second that it's gonna be good news?

08:18.362 --> 08:20.253
She had a panic attack at the airport,

08:20.253 --> 08:23.628
and her doctor's afraid it might bring on early labor.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.503
He doesn't want her to travel.

08:25.737 --> 08:27.300
She's staying here?

08:28.078 --> 08:29.675
Until the baby's born.

08:30.891 --> 08:33.736
Look, I am gonna make this work, I promise.

08:33.736 --> 08:36.238
I get it. It's fine.

08:36.238 --> 08:39.999
Besides, new york city is a great place to be born--

08:39.999 --> 08:43.424
it's very international,it's got great public transportation.

08:43.424 --> 08:44.254
You know what?

08:44.254 --> 08:46.300
Um, it's getting really busy around here.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.925
I re--I gotta go.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.488
Betty, I'M...

08:52.719 --> 08:54.441
sorry.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.941
and before you know it,

09:01.941 --> 09:06.487
bang--he asked me to be mrs. Dr. Goldfarb.

09:06.487 --> 09:08.425
Well, that is quite a story.

09:08.425 --> 09:10.925
And the best part about elopin' on a cruise

09:10.925 --> 09:13.363
is we were already in canc鶱.

09:13.363 --> 09:15.643
We honeymooned in his time-share.

09:15.643 --> 09:18.363
Mm, that is so great.

09:18.363 --> 09:19.988
And also, you shouldn't feel bad.

09:19.988 --> 09:21.925
Everyone gains weight on a cruise.

09:22.625 --> 09:26.237
You're probably not used to seein' designer clothes.

09:26.237 --> 09:28.128
Roomier is a look ya pay for.

09:28.128 --> 09:31.925
So, gina, what brings you back to the neighborhood?

09:31.925 --> 09:34.738
Just wanted to say hello to all my old friends...

09:34.738 --> 09:37.925
And I wanted to know how you're doing, of course.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.237
Oh, things are great.

09:39.237 --> 09:42.503
Got my cosmetology license,I'm running my own business.

09:42.503 --> 09:44.800
You are lucky that I could fit you in today.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.363
And I have to say,this place is adorable.

09:48.363 --> 09:51.675
It kind of reminds me of my closet up in mount kisco.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.815
Yeah, well, we did what we could with the space.

09:54.815 --> 09:56.999
It hasn't exactly been the easiest year.

09:56.999 --> 09:59.300
Oh, that's right.

09:59.300 --> 10:03.362
I was so sorry to hear about santos, hilda,

10:03.362 --> 10:08.050
but if I've learned anything,it's that a higher power has a plan for all of us.

10:08.050 --> 10:11.472
Maybe you're just meant to be alone, and that's okay.

10:11.472 --> 10:12.925
Oh, sorry.

10:12.925 --> 10:15.925
That's a, um, that's a sensitive part of the nail.

10:16.563 --> 10:16.675
All right.

10:16.675 --> 10:17.999
I think we are done here.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.925
You are so good at this.

10:19.925 --> 10:22.800
I think I should come back later and have you do my feet.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.363
Oh, and I could bring larry.

10:24.363 --> 10:25.487
It'll be fun.

10:27.187 --> 10:28.941
Ciao.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.409
 It's never enough  um, what do you think you're doing?

10:39.409 --> 10:41.503
Oh, I'm concerned about daniel's posture,

10:41.503 --> 10:43.940
so I found this great alexander technique teacher,

10:43.940 --> 10:46.999
but he can only see him this afternoon, so...

10:46.999 --> 10:50.315
oh, um, see,daniel's schedule is my job,

10:50.315 --> 10:53.565
so please don't touch his calendar.

10:53.565 --> 10:57.550
Well, he's my boyfriend,so if I want daniel to do something,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.425
you can't stop me, missy.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.300
Well, he's not available this afternoon.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.175
Sorry.

11:03.237 --> 11:05.488
 Yes, he is.

11:05.488 --> 11:07.238
No, he really isn'T.

11:07.238 --> 11:07.628
Let go.

11:07.628 --> 11:08.347
You let go.

11:08.347 --> 11:10.237
give me back my schedule.

11:15.438 --> 11:16.925
what's goin' on?

11:19.112 --> 11:22.488
Daniel, I tried.It's not wking.

11:22.488 --> 11:23.925
I know you really like this girl,

11:23.925 --> 11:25.675
but when it comes to is office,

11:25.675 --> 11:27.999
it's her or me.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.128
What the hell was that?

11:31.128 --> 11:32.940
Isn't it obvious? Your assistant

11:32.940 --> 11:34.300
is totally in love with you.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.999
I can't believe it's never occurred to you before--

11:57.999 --> 12:00.612
the way she follows you around, hanging on your every word.

12:00.612 --> 12:01.999
Well, renee, she's my assistant.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.862
That's sort of her job, right?

12:03.862 --> 12:06.237
It's so sweet how modest you are.

12:06.687 --> 12:08.238
What do you mean?

12:10.250 --> 12:12.550
You exude mystique...

12:12.550 --> 12:14.050
power...

12:14.375 --> 12:16.113
sexuality.

12:16.113 --> 12:16.987
Frankly,

12:16.987 --> 12:19.613
I'm surprised most women don't just tear your clothes off.

12:20.050 --> 12:21.550
Well, it's happened.

12:21.550 --> 12:24.237
And how many of them have been your assistants?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.987
But that doesn't mean that betty is actually--

12:26.987 --> 12:28.987
(gasps) doesn't it?

12:28.987 --> 12:32.425
She spends all day around a man most women would only dream of having...

12:32.425 --> 12:36.800
going over your schedule,determining where you go...

12:36.800 --> 12:39.816
which women you can talk to.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.769
No, she does do that--

12:41.769 --> 12:43.675
look, I'm just saying be careful.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.175
You know, I've seen this sort of thing happen before,

12:46.175 --> 12:49.425
and it can become a problem.

12:49.613 --> 12:52.800
Maybe you should ask yourself,

12:52.800 --> 12:55.597
is there something you might have said to lead her on?

12:56.312 --> 12:58.237
 (Daniel) you scheduled a nap for me?

12:58.237 --> 12:59.269
 Oh, I love you.

12:59.269 --> 13:00.613
 I know. (Sniffs)

13:00.613 --> 13:02.363
 mmm, you smell great.

13:02.363 --> 13:04.175
Oh, god.

13:04.987 --> 13:07.625
I am telling you, there is something weird about renee,

13:07.675 --> 13:10.250
and it is not just  that she's been getting in the way of my work.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.863
I thought the same thing last week,

13:11.863 --> 13:15.237
and then things went strangely quiet around here.

13:15.237 --> 13:17.237
I think wilhelmina figured out I was snoopin'.

13:17.237 --> 13:20.238
She threw out the baby monitor I was using to listen in.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.999
(singsongy) christina!

13:21.999 --> 13:24.800
Time for a decadent foot rub.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.925
(Whispers) and marc has been creepily nice ever since.

13:26.925 --> 13:28.487
oh, go away, you wanker!

13:28.487 --> 13:30.487
Well, how long does wilhelmina expect you

13:30.487 --> 13:32.816
to be on this leave of absence from "mode," anyway?

13:32.816 --> 13:34.269
I'm stuck in here until she's sure

13:34.269 --> 13:35.862
the baby's safely on the way.

13:35.862 --> 13:37.238
I heard on "the view" that relaxation

13:37.238 --> 13:41.206
is good for all those baby-makin' hormones.

13:41.206 --> 13:42.253
(Whispers) wait a minute.

13:42.253 --> 13:47.175
m-morning sickness! Oh, oh, oh!

13:47.175 --> 13:49.550
okay, I'll check on you later!

13:49.550 --> 13:50.925
All right.

13:50.925 --> 13:53.816
Okay, if you want me to start snooping, I will,

13:53.816 --> 13:54.863
but you have got to get onto daniel.

13:54.863 --> 13:56.504
See what you can find out, okay?

13:56.504 --> 13:57.628
Okay.

14:02.613 --> 14:05.425
it is just like you to choose this place afteeverything

14:05.425 --> 14:06.629
I went through here.

14:06.629 --> 14:08.331
Whatever are you talking about?

14:09.425 --> 14:12.503
Oh, my.

14:12.578 --> 14:15.550
This was gregory's favorite place, wasn't it?

14:15.550 --> 14:16.675
I just realized that.

14:16.675 --> 14:17.925
W utterly tasteless of me.

14:17.925 --> 14:18.893
I'll be leaving now.

14:18.893 --> 14:20.940
No, renee. No, please sit.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.363
I want to apologize for how I've acted.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.112
I only had your best interests at heart.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.238
You see, in the past,

14:31.238 --> 14:35.659
daniel has cheated on his girlfriends a lot,

14:35.659 --> 14:40.112
kind of indiscriminately, but he really seems to have changed for you.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.894
You're just saying all of this because you want to start a fight with me.

14:42.894 --> 14:44.050
Haven't we fought enough, renee?

14:44.050 --> 14:44.972
You're my sister.

14:44.972 --> 14:45.863
I care about you.

14:45.863 --> 14:48.738
Then why do you want me to think that daniel cheats?

14:48.738 --> 14:50.612
 Used to cheat.

14:50.612 --> 14:56.113
So there's really no reason for you to be worried or jealous.

14:56.113 --> 14:56.987
Well, I'm not worried.

14:56.987 --> 15:01.253
And come to think of it,what betteplace than this to toast your joyous future

15:01.253 --> 15:06.815
and say good-bye to all those awful memories of gregory larson.

15:06.815 --> 15:08.363
Happy birthday.

15:08.534 --> 15:11.425
 gregory... jealous... larson.

15:11.425 --> 15:12.503
There must be a mistake.

15:12.503 --> 15:14.190
I-I think you have the wrong table.

15:14.190 --> 15:17.300
No candles. No candles.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.300
you are a dear.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.800
(Betty) daniel?

15:35.831 --> 15:38.425
I thought it wasa little too bright in herefor your nap.

15:38.425 --> 15:39.999
Oh, you don't have to do that.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.737
I'm actually, uh, fine.

15:41.737 --> 15:43.363
Oh, don't be silly.

15:43.363 --> 15:46.988
It'll be so much better with the lights off.

15:50.562 --> 15:52.175
what are you doing?

15:52.175 --> 15:54.362
Just trying to help you relax.

15:54.362 --> 15:58.675
I need you at your bestthis afternoon.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.347
How about a massage?

16:04.250 --> 16:07.487
just--just let bettytake care of everything.

16:09.610 --> 16:11.237
you smell so good, daniel,

16:11.237 --> 16:15.238
like--like muscles and power.

16:16.703 --> 16:17.925
I want you.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.175
No!

16:21.625 --> 16:23.987
I mean, maybe.

16:26.050 --> 16:30.987
Um, what i think daniel is trying to sayis that he would really like

16:30.987 --> 16:34.238
to see some new,different layout ideas...

16:34.238 --> 16:36.722
like, um, in an hour?

16:38.688 --> 16:41.878
but good job. Thanks.

16:44.265 --> 16:46.237
Did I really just fall asleepin the middle of a meeting?

16:46.237 --> 16:48.175
Yes, but it's fine.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.737
I think they thought it wassome sort of power move.

16:51.516 --> 16:53.315
You're probably just exhausted.

16:53.315 --> 16:54.362
You just need some rest.

16:54.362 --> 16:57.112
No, no, no! Uh, you don't have to close the shades.

16:57.112 --> 16:58.940
Totally awake. I'm--I'm fine.

16:58.940 --> 17:02.363
Um, okay.

17:02.609 --> 17:06.705
Daniel,now that we're alone...

17:07.375 --> 17:11.487
there's something that I've beenmeaning to talk to you about.

17:11.487 --> 17:13.925
It's a little personal.

17:13.925 --> 17:18.487
Um..how personal?

17:19.375 --> 17:23.050
It's about...relationships?

17:24.186 --> 17:26.487
Just need a second, okay?

17:32.987 --> 17:34.237
Well, I think we're safe.

17:34.237 --> 17:37.050
The way renee reactedto those candles,shouldn't take long.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.362
Best to keep dr. Remuson speed dial.

17:39.362 --> 17:43.253
So sad gucci doesn't makea straitjacket. 

17:43.425 --> 17:45.863
I get no joyfrom this, marc.

17:45.956 --> 17:47.987
Well, that's not true.

17:47.987 --> 17:50.863
I get a little joy,but it's tempered with sadness.

17:50.863 --> 17:54.238
Well, you're not the onewho's guilty of mur--

17:54.782 --> 18:00.472
(gasps) marc,you really have to be carefulabout mentioning reneeand the "m" word.

18:00.472 --> 18:02.706
but since the coast is clear,can I just say it once?

18:02.706 --> 18:03.831
(Filtered voice) fine.

18:03.831 --> 18:05.800
 Murder.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.347
Oh, don't forget to changethe locks on my armoire,just in case.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.206
Did I hear right thatyou fell asleep in a meeting?

18:14.206 --> 18:17.894
Yeah, but, uh, it was kind ofa power move, you know?

18:17.894 --> 18:20.300
Okay, you know how importantthis christian siriano meetingis, right?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.691
We're competing with "vogue,""bazaar" and "elle"

18:22.691 --> 18:24.300
to get his designsin the september issue.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.863
He's saidhe's only doing one. 

18:25.863 --> 18:26.300
Seriously?

18:28.125 --> 18:29.503
so he's kind of a diva.

18:29.503 --> 18:31.113
I need you at your best,daniel.

18:31.113 --> 18:31.722
And look at you.

18:31.722 --> 18:33.347
You're all linty.

18:33.347 --> 18:35.050
Here. I noticedyou were linty, too.

18:35.050 --> 18:36.581
Oh, betty,you don't have to--

18:36.581 --> 18:37.925
oh, don't worry about it.

18:37.925 --> 18:38.862
You know I don't mind.

18:39.363 --> 18:45.050
So, uh, daniel,that thing I wantedto ask you about earlier--

18:45.050 --> 18:46.925
it's about renee.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.690
I mean, I don't know muchabout her, daniel,

18:48.690 --> 18:51.690
other than she's crazy about you.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.612
What time is that, uh,siriano meeting?

18:53.612 --> 18:54.440
Oh, don't worry about it.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.050
You've got plenty of time.

18:56.438 --> 18:58.237
But seriously, daniel,

18:58.237 --> 19:00.675
I mean,how much do youreally know about her?

19:00.675 --> 19:03.112
You guys have beenmoving so fast.

19:03.112 --> 19:04.113
Okay.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.800
I'm lint-free. Thanks.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.160
Are you okay?Great.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.238
Uh, you know, you never reallytalk about henry anymore.

19:11.238 --> 19:12.113
How's--how's he doing?

19:12.113 --> 19:16.190
Fine, I guess. Uh, I don'tget to see him that often,

19:16.190 --> 19:17.487
what with all the work this week.

19:17.487 --> 19:20.187
It's almost like you'remy boyfriend now. (Laughs)

19:23.253 --> 19:24.628
oh, hi, christian.

19:24.628 --> 19:25.565
Hi, christian.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.050
Amanda, um, what would you doif someone had a crush on you,

19:28.050 --> 19:31.050
and it started to affectyour ability to do work?

19:31.050 --> 19:33.300
Oh, my god. I knew it.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.737
Someone has a crush on me.

19:35.737 --> 19:36.550
Is it nick pepper?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.144
Because he's beenacting really weirdever since we made outthat one time.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.488
No, not someonewith a crush on you.

19:41.488 --> 19:43.300
Som-someonewith a crush on me.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.112
Oh. I get it.

19:46.112 --> 19:47.175
Yeah.

19:47.175 --> 19:49.863
And I am mostly over you,but I do have a rulethat if I date someone,

19:49.863 --> 19:52.175
I get to think about themin the shower sometimes.

19:52.175 --> 19:54.175
I'm talking about betty.

19:54.175 --> 19:57.237
Wait, you think bettyhas a crush on you?

19:58.175 --> 20:00.691
(Gasps) although she ison the rocks with that hot accountantof hers.

20:00.691 --> 20:03.612
I heard they werefighting this morning.

20:03.612 --> 20:04.753
Wait, they're fighting? Why?

20:04.753 --> 20:05.425
Yawn. More baby mama drama.

20:05.425 --> 20:08.050
I guess the girlhe got all preg-nasty

20:08.050 --> 20:09.503
is waitin' aroundto pop it out,

20:09.503 --> 20:11.050
so now triple chinsis into you.

20:11.050 --> 20:12.363
What am I gonna do?

20:12.363 --> 20:14.238
Daniel,I will tell you this--

20:14.238 --> 20:16.550
when you're lettingsomeone down,

20:16.550 --> 20:19.300
it helps to besensitive to their feelings.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.315
You weren't alwaysthat way with me.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.941
Oh, amanda,I'm sorry. I-I--

20:24.941 --> 20:28.268
anyway. I just always thoughtshe'd end up with that guy gio.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.863
He's so patheticallyinto her,

20:29.863 --> 20:32.362
always up heredelivering her sandwiches.

20:32.362 --> 20:34.675
And give betty enough food,it's just a matter of time

20:34.675 --> 20:36.175
before she falls in love.

20:36.378 --> 20:37.999
Thanks, amanda.

20:38.722 --> 20:39.987
What was thatabout gio and betty?

20:39.987 --> 20:42.800
Nothing. He's justtotally in love with her.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.999
Oops.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.441
You could do better.

20:56.362 --> 20:58.425
Wait, this is allabout gina gambarro?

20:58.425 --> 21:02.362
Oh, you should've seen herwith her designer earrinand her gucci belt.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.925
There wasn't an inch of her thatwasn't covered in brand names.

21:04.925 --> 21:07.613
Okay, hilda, pleasedon't tell justin I said this,

21:07.613 --> 21:09.738
but none of this stuffactually means anything.

21:09.738 --> 21:12.566
 Ay, look, all I knowis that as I'm sitting there

21:12.566 --> 21:14.440
and she's telling meabout her great life,

21:14.440 --> 21:17.675
I'm looking aroundat our little houseand my stupid salonand I'm thinking,

21:17.675 --> 21:19.612
what do I haveto show for myself?

21:19.612 --> 21:22.999
So gina marriedsome guy for money.

21:23.394 --> 21:24.363
So what?

21:24.363 --> 21:29.237
 You have a wonderful son,a family that loves you.

21:29.237 --> 21:30.707
You should notbe jealous of her.

21:30.707 --> 21:31.999
She should be jealous of you. 

21:31.999 --> 21:33.238
That's what I said.

21:33.238 --> 21:34.999
That's why I'm here--

21:34.999 --> 21:36.300
to make her jealous.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.925
Hilda, this is not healthy.

21:37.925 --> 21:39.816
(Sighs) you know, you're oneto talk about jealousy,

21:39.816 --> 21:42.441
what with charlie and henryand henry and gio.

21:42.441 --> 21:43.363
Oh, come on.

21:43.363 --> 21:45.550
That is totally different.

21:45.550 --> 21:46.378
Oh, that's right.

21:46.378 --> 21:49.300
You still won't tell henrythat you're friends with giobecause that's healthy.

21:52.425 --> 21:53.347
you know what?

21:53.347 --> 21:54.784
I have a lot of work to do.

21:54.784 --> 21:55.488
Bye.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.254
(lowers voice) christina, pleasetell me you found something.

21:59.254 --> 22:01.316
Betty,wilhelmina was going on about renee

22:01.316 --> 22:02.737
and--and locked drawers,

22:02.737 --> 22:04.425
so I took a knife and I brokein, and now I need you here.

22:04.425 --> 22:05.753
Wait, wait. Slow down. What?

22:05.753 --> 22:07.300
Wilhelmina and marchave gone out,

22:07.300 --> 22:08.641
and I need helpto go through all these files.

22:08.691 --> 22:10.519
There's just too many of them.

22:10.519 --> 22:11.784
Why? What's in there?

22:11.784 --> 22:15.629
Evidence. You see, wilhelminawas talking about renee,

22:15.629 --> 22:18.238
and then she mentionedthe "m" word.

22:18.484 --> 22:19.988
(Gasps) the "m" word?

22:19.988 --> 22:21.925
Wait, there are a lot of wordsthat start with "M."

22:21.925 --> 22:23.457
 Murder!

22:31.187 --> 22:32.472
hey, henry.

22:33.188 --> 22:34.237
What can I do for you?

22:36.112 --> 22:37.488
You can stay away from betty.

22:39.313 --> 22:40.596
Excuse me?

22:40.596 --> 22:42.800
I only havefour weeks left with her.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.129
I don't need to be hearingthat you're always around

22:45.129 --> 22:47.113
with some crush.

22:48.343 --> 22:49.613
"Crush"?

22:49.999 --> 22:51.503
I don't know whereyou're getting that from.

22:51.503 --> 22:54.487
Just stay away from her,got it?

22:54.487 --> 22:56.363
Oh, I see.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.675
You wanna fit.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.394
All right. Well,

23:00.394 --> 23:01.862
let's get it over with.

23:01.862 --> 23:03.503
What? Wait.That's not what I meant.

23:03.503 --> 23:04.629
It wasn't?No.

23:04.629 --> 23:06.237
'Cause in my neighborhood,

23:06.237 --> 23:08.000
when a guy says what you just said,

23:08.050 --> 23:09.237
it means he wants a fight.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.847
I'll even let youhave the first punch.

23:11.847 --> 23:12.999
I'm not gonna hit you.

23:12.999 --> 23:13.987
It'll make you feel better.

23:13.987 --> 23:14.566
Go ahead.

23:14.566 --> 23:16.237
Take a swing, like this.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.612
Son of a bitch!

23:21.612 --> 23:22.488
I'm sorry. Oh, god.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.550
Man, you can hit.

23:23.550 --> 23:24.628
I thought you were gonna hit me.

23:24.628 --> 23:27.610
Well, I wasn'T. I was just trying to scare you off.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.753
I didn't think you were gonna actually hit me.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.144
Yeah, neither did I.

23:32.562 --> 23:35.800
Here.Put that on there.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.113
Sit--sit down.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.988
So what's up, henry?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.925
Are you really mad at me, or...

23:41.925 --> 23:43.878
is this about something else?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.863
I'm stuck.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.316
I try to be a good boyfriend,

23:51.316 --> 23:53.438
and I end up not being the dad I want to be,

23:53.488 --> 23:56.988
and I try to be a good father,and I end up hurting betty.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.862
I'm just... scared I'm gonna lose her.

24:05.625 --> 24:10.113
You know,the one thing I don't get is,

24:10.113 --> 24:12.815
if you have four weeks left with her,

24:12.815 --> 24:16.253
then what the hell are you doing wasting your time here with me?

24:19.313 --> 24:22.050
Henry did what to you?

24:22.550 --> 24:23.863
henry punched gio.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.331
Really? Good for him.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.238
well,what did you do to deserve it?

24:28.238 --> 24:29.862
Well, I'm just saying.

24:29.862 --> 24:31.488
But look, gio,I'm really busy.

24:31.488 --> 24:33.800
I can't talk right now.Can I call you back?

24:35.238 --> 24:37.613
ugh. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell henry about gio.

24:37.613 --> 24:39.953
I knew something like this would happen.

24:39.999 --> 24:40.800
This'll take your mind off it.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.175
Come and see the dirt that wilhelmina's got on all these people--

24:43.175 --> 24:47.050
madonna, trent lott,george clooney!

24:47.050 --> 24:48.925
Oh, renee's got to be in here somewhere.

24:48.925 --> 24:49.999
Ryan seacrest?

24:49.999 --> 24:51.237
I don't know why she's sittin' on that.

24:51.237 --> 24:52.987
Someone should take him down.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.050
What's this? "Rhonda slater."

24:57.050 --> 24:58.613
You think maybe they're related?

24:58.613 --> 25:00.753
Rhonda--that is renee's real name.

25:01.078 --> 25:02.222
Oh, my gosh.Here, here, here.

25:02.222 --> 25:04.238
There's a lot of stuff here.

25:06.438 --> 25:10.315
Hey, look at this."Stony brook professor dies in fire."

25:10.315 --> 25:13.175
Renee was talking to wilhelmina about stony brook.

25:13.175 --> 25:17.300
"Professor greg larson died in a house fire on saturday.Arson is suspected."

25:17.300 --> 25:19.660
His name is larson,and he died of arson.

25:19.660 --> 25:23.175
Unfortunate.It's a picture of renee with professor larson.

25:23.175 --> 25:28.378
Ooh. They were lovers.This is gettin' good.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.362
nina, I didn't realizeyou'd be coming along, too.

25:31.362 --> 25:35.378
Well, darling,the show has me keeping an eye on christian.

25:35.378 --> 25:36.128
Where is he, by the way?

25:36.128 --> 25:37.363
Fashionably late?

25:37.363 --> 25:38.956
Oh, he loves to make an entrance.

25:38.956 --> 25:41.863
Winning this contest has really gone to his head.

25:48.175 --> 25:49.987
The house of siriano has arrived.

25:49.987 --> 25:51.878
Worship me, bitches.

25:51.878 --> 25:53.863
Hi, mr. Siriano.Daniel meade.

25:53.863 --> 25:57.925
On behalf of "mode,"I'd like to sayhow fierce it isto have you here.

25:57.925 --> 26:01.112
Oh, okay, but no one uses that word around me. It's ov.

26:01.112 --> 26:03.737
Allow me to apologize for my brother. He didn't know.

26:03.737 --> 26:04.988
Hello, ferosha.

26:04.988 --> 26:08.237
You're certainly a hot tranny mess,minus the mess, of course.

26:08.237 --> 26:10.566
Oh, thanks, I think.

26:10.566 --> 26:13.612
Oh, but this placeis a bit boring. Models...

26:13.612 --> 26:14.285
work it.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.300
You know what couldgive it some drama?

26:25.300 --> 26:27.175
What the hell's going on here, daniel?

26:27.175 --> 26:28.738
Uh, nothing's going on.

26:28.738 --> 26:31.629
We're just kind of in the mile of a meeting here, sweetie.

26:31.629 --> 26:33.113
Yeah, I see this.

26:33.613 --> 26:35.237
Are these your whores?What?

26:35.237 --> 26:36.519
Is this your slut?No.

26:36.519 --> 26:38.284
And after everything we've been through,

26:38.284 --> 26:41.050
I will not lose you without a fight.

26:41.050 --> 26:43.362
Actually, that works.

26:43.613 --> 26:46.112
So renee had an affair with her professor.

26:46.112 --> 26:47.878
Here, look. What's this?

26:48.284 --> 26:49.487
Looks like commitment papers.

26:49.487 --> 26:51.362
For a gay wedding.Renee's a lesbian.

26:51.362 --> 26:55.050
christina.For a mental institution.

26:55.050 --> 26:55.613
Look.

26:55.613 --> 27:01.863
"renee slater...involuntarily hospitalized...six years."

27:02.672 --> 27:04.737
I have never been so...

27:04.737 --> 27:05.941
what the hell is the matter with you?

27:05.941 --> 27:07.941
I had to do something to get your attention, daniel.

27:07.941 --> 27:08.999
You have been avoiding me.

27:08.999 --> 27:11.863
I have called and called,but that betty won't let me through.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.488
I have been in meetings.

27:13.488 --> 27:16.363
Yeah, with beautiful women.You're surrounded by them.

27:16.363 --> 27:18.346
I know your history, daniel.

27:18.346 --> 27:21.550
how many times do I have to tell you,there are no other women?

27:25.125 --> 27:28.425
there better not be,or I swear to god,I will kill you!

27:31.000 --> 27:34.925
Sometimes there's no other word--fierce.

27:42.688 --> 27:44.300
look, you tried to warn me.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.890
I'm just afraid renee might hurt someone.

27:46.940 --> 27:49.862
Oh, daniel,I'm so relieved you called.

27:49.862 --> 27:52.425
It must have been such a hard decision for you to make.

27:52.425 --> 27:53.737
call dr. Remus.

27:53.737 --> 27:57.315
I think daniel will help the doctor over his commitment issues.

28:01.988 --> 28:04.909
??????????????

28:04.909 --> 28:07.613
Didn't you say the other day that she flipped out when you tried to light a candle?

28:07.613 --> 28:08.753
I did.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.487
One sister's a pyro,the other one's a psycho--

28:10.487 --> 28:11.999
real winnersin this family, eh?

28:11.999 --> 28:13.112
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

28:13.112 --> 28:16.862
So renee has an affair with professor larson,

28:16.862 --> 28:22.863
he dies in a fire,and then she is hospitalized for being a jealous pyromaniac.

28:22.863 --> 28:25.394
Renee murdered her boyfriend.

28:25.394 --> 28:27.753
Daniel.

28:28.285 --> 28:29.925
Hello, "mode" magazine.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.581
Amanda, it's betty.I need to talk to daniel.

28:31.581 --> 28:34.300
Okay, betty.What is this regarding?

28:34.300 --> 28:37.722
Amanda, quit screwing around.It's betty suarez.

28:37.722 --> 28:39.113
Oh, that is so weird.

28:39.113 --> 28:42.628
We have a girl who works herewith, like,the exact same name.

28:42.628 --> 28:43.737
You sound much prettier, though.

28:43.737 --> 28:45.987
Look, daniel isn't answering his cell phone.

28:45.987 --> 28:48.113
I know he's supposed to be in that meeting with christian siriano,

28:48.113 --> 28:49.565
but I really need to talk to him.

28:49.565 --> 28:51.222
I think that meeting may have ended.

28:51.222 --> 28:52.238
What?

28:52.238 --> 28:52.999
Daniel already went home.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.550
Oh, no. I scheduled him to go home and take a nap.

28:55.550 --> 28:56.238
He probably turned his cell phone off.

28:56.238 --> 29:00.050
And he's probably exhausted from that huge fight he had

29:00.050 --> 29:01.862
with his girlfriend in the middle of the meeting.

29:01.862 --> 29:02.769
What fight?

29:02.769 --> 29:04.987
Well, everyone's talking about it.

29:04.987 --> 29:07.862
And you know what? I am all for some boyfriend stalking.

29:07.862 --> 29:08.440
I mean, who isn't?

29:08.440 --> 29:12.425
But that woman was...crazy 

29:12.425 --> 29:16.175
oh, no. I think renee went off the deep end.

29:16.175 --> 29:17.816
I have to go find daniel.

29:23.687 --> 29:28.612
sorry I took so long,and, gina, I have to apologize for that outfit this morning.

29:28.612 --> 29:30.640
I usually dress down for work.

29:30.690 --> 29:33.300
I don't want to intimidate the clientele.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.284
It's a little flashy for me.

29:35.284 --> 29:38.656
Is it? I have so many clothes like this,

29:38.706 --> 29:40.503
I guess I just don't notice.

29:40.503 --> 29:42.675
Shouldn't we get started?

29:42.675 --> 29:45.050
You can put my pradas anywhere.

29:47.625 --> 29:48.953
this shoe doesn't look right.

29:48.999 --> 29:51.000
Oh, you know those luxury brands.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.237
Everything's handmade, so it's unique, like a snowflake.

29:54.237 --> 29:58.188
This isn't a snowflake. It's a snow-fake.

29:58.238 --> 30:01.988
Excuse me?This is prada.

30:01.988 --> 30:05.050
 This is nada.

30:05.050 --> 30:07.579
You are pathetic,with your fake-ass hair

30:07.629 --> 30:09.425
and your fake-ass clothes.

30:09.425 --> 30:10.863
I bet you're not even married.

30:10.863 --> 30:12.332
Oh, I am so married.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.566
He's out parking the 5 seriesright now.

30:14.566 --> 30:15.487
Then he isn't a doctor.

30:15.487 --> 30:17.175
Oh, he's a doctor all right.

30:17.175 --> 30:19.737
Look.That says "chiropractor."

30:19.737 --> 30:21.862
That's not even a real doctor.

30:21.862 --> 30:22.363
Sorry I took so long.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.754
It's, uh, hard to finda space around here.

30:24.754 --> 30:29.800
Honey, i want to leave.But I just found a space.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.191
Yeah, why rush off?

30:31.191 --> 30:33.379
You and dr. Chiropractorjust got here.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.925
Please?

30:40.125 --> 30:42.362
I'll do whatever makes you happy.

30:47.375 --> 30:50.987
if you get your kicks makin' my wife feel lousy,then I'm sorry.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.238
Your life must be pretty sad.

30:56.987 --> 31:00.875
renee is,among other things, a borderline personality.

31:00.925 --> 31:04.862
Without medication,she'll fixate on a personand become extremely jealous

31:04.862 --> 31:06.750
if she thinks she's losing her hold on them.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.625
That can manifest itself with violence,

31:09.675 --> 31:11.878
specifically,the setting of fires.

31:11.878 --> 31:13.722
And you're saying she killed this guy

31:13.722 --> 31:14.862
she was seeing--larson.

31:14.862 --> 31:16.863
Well, it's a bitmore complicated than that.

31:16.863 --> 31:18.800
With my father's intervention,we were able to get renee

31:18.800 --> 31:22.175
the help she neededand keep the good slater nameout of the paper.

31:22.175 --> 31:24.297
I'm sorry.It's just, I can't believerenee would want to kill me.

31:24.347 --> 31:26.441
Well, technically you're right.

31:26.441 --> 31:29.675
Renee focuses her angeron a "gatekeeper"--

31:29.675 --> 31:32.300
someone she thinksis keeping her from her lover.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.999
Yes, yes, distinctions.

31:33.999 --> 31:36.890
What's important is we get renee back into the asylum where she belongs.

31:36.940 --> 31:37.691
Wait.

31:37.691 --> 31:40.050
What--what did you mean,"trying to keep herfrom her lover"?

31:40.050 --> 31:44.113
Well, in larson's case,renee was convinced his secretary wasin love with him,

31:44.113 --> 31:46.987
so renee started a fire,hoping to trap her.

31:46.987 --> 31:50.363
That larson got caught in itwas just bad luck.

31:50.363 --> 31:52.999
As long as she's not worried about another woman,

31:52.999 --> 31:54.363
you're fine.

31:54.688 --> 31:56.175
Oh, my god.

32:00.938 --> 32:01.687
hello?

32:02.687 --> 32:03.800
Daniel!

32:05.437 --> 32:09.250
Daniel, it's betty.The door is open.

32:15.062 --> 32:17.112
Daniel?

32:21.719 --> 32:24.316
I wanted to have a specl evening with daniel,

32:24.316 --> 32:27.862
but once again,here you are, betty,

32:27.862 --> 32:33.909
getting in between us...just like you've been doingall along.

32:37.125 --> 32:38.612
Daniel's mine, betty...

32:38.612 --> 32:40.925
and I'm not gonna let you have him.

32:41.703 --> 32:44.675
Renee, th-this is all a-a terrible misunderstanding.

32:44.675 --> 32:48.391
I see how you look at him,how you talk to him.

32:48.441 --> 32:50.113
No. No, no. No,

32:50.113 --> 32:53.109
I-I talk to him like this,"hi, daniel. It's betty."

32:53.159 --> 32:54.957
See? That's normal.

32:54.957 --> 32:59.313
Then why are you doing everythingto keep him away from me?

32:59.363 --> 33:01.113
You answer his phone.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.063
Betty,you control his appointments.

33:03.113 --> 33:07.566
I'm his assistant.That is what assistants do.

33:11.438 --> 33:13.862
He sleeps  with his assistants!

33:16.750 --> 33:19.750
renee,I have a boyfriend--

33:19.800 --> 33:21.999
henry--who I love very, very much.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.175
Then why are you spendingall of your days

33:24.175 --> 33:28.254
and all of your nights at work with my boyfriend?

33:28.254 --> 33:31.237
Uh, maybe because it's, uh,it's a really busy time,

33:31.237 --> 33:34.875
or, uh, maybe there are some things that I don't wanna talkto henry about.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.862
So you're lying to him?You're a liar.

33:36.862 --> 33:41.188
 No. No.Henry is leaving for tucson,

33:41.238 --> 33:43.691
so I don't really want him to know about gio.

33:43.691 --> 33:45.629
Gio? Who's gio?He's this other guy.

33:45.629 --> 33:46.999
Henry's a little jealous of him.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.300
He punched him.It's complicated.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.988
So you have two guys.Isn't that enough?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.109
hello?Daniel, it's betty!

33:59.159 --> 34:00.254
I'm in your apartment.

34:00.254 --> 34:02.441
Renee's crazy.She's trying to kill me!

34:02.441 --> 34:04.175
Help me! Hurry!

34:04.175 --> 34:07.113
 betty.Betty, are you still there?

34:07.113 --> 34:08.688
Are you all right?

34:09.125 --> 34:10.675
she's got bettyat my apartment.

34:10.675 --> 34:13.375
I hope you know, I prayed this day would never come,daniel.

34:13.425 --> 34:16.175
I don't care what you have to do,you get us there faster.

34:18.063 --> 34:19.656
I really hopeit doesn't come to this,

34:19.706 --> 34:21.391
but I know some very good people

34:21.440 --> 34:24.378
who would love  to be your assistant...

34:25.312 --> 34:27.393
you know,if we're too late.

34:29.972 --> 34:33.112
I swear to you,I don't want daniel.

34:33.112 --> 34:38.188
And you only think I do,because of some weird little jealousy thing you've got goin' on.

34:38.237 --> 34:40.112
Why shouldn't I be jealous?

34:40.112 --> 34:41.641
He's my boyfriend, betty.

34:41.690 --> 34:44.534
Yes.Yes, I understand that.

34:44.534 --> 34:46.800
See--see,my boyfriend--henry--

34:46.800 --> 34:49.112
he got--gothis ex-girlfriend pregnant,

34:49.112 --> 34:51.612
so I spend a lot of time being really jealous of charlie.

34:51.612 --> 34:53.425
Charlie? There's another guy?

34:53.425 --> 34:54.565
No, no, no. That's a girl.

34:54.565 --> 34:58.175
Stop it!Stop telling me these things.

35:08.703 --> 35:10.863
okay. All right.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.691
Renee,you don't want to make this worse than it already is.

35:22.375 --> 35:25.566
renee,the apartment is on fire.

35:25.847 --> 35:27.707
We need to get out of here.

35:27.707 --> 35:30.050
You are not going anywhere.

35:30.050 --> 35:33.207
You will never take daniel away from me, ever again.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.987
I didn't take daniel from you.

35:36.987 --> 35:39.675
You made this all up in your head.

35:39.675 --> 35:43.800
You are so afraid to lose him that you can't see what's real.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.175
I am just his assistant.

35:46.175 --> 35:50.253
Daniel loves you.What?

35:50.253 --> 35:55.050
He loves you.You think daniel loves me?

35:55.050 --> 35:57.300
Yes. He loves you.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.144
I-I can--I can see it in his eyes

35:59.144 --> 36:02.050
and the--and the way he talks about you.

36:02.050 --> 36:06.441
Renee, it's what's real.Daniel loves you.

36:09.562 --> 36:12.425
I don't know what's wrong with me, betty.

36:12.469 --> 36:15.488
Nothing makes sense anymore.

36:20.187 --> 36:21.362
come on.

36:31.831 --> 36:33.628
it's bolted from the inside.

36:34.390 --> 36:36.113
Oh, be a man, daniel.

36:49.531 --> 36:51.300
you don't pay me enough.

36:54.563 --> 36:56.331
at least everyone made it out.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.375
here you go.

37:00.375 --> 37:04.456
I don't know what happened.I'm so sorry, daniel.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.628
I really thought I was getting better.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.925
I never meant to--I'm sorry, too.

37:19.875 --> 37:23.863
willie, I know this must be hard--don't say anything.

37:23.863 --> 37:25.500
We chose our side.

37:25.550 --> 37:27.190
It's over.

37:27.797 --> 37:29.300
There, there.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.800
We're gonna get you the help you need.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.222
she looked so lost afterwards,

37:58.222 --> 38:00.112
and then they just took her away.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.562
That is so sad.

38:02.612 --> 38:04.363
Do you think daniel's gonna be okay?

38:04.363 --> 38:06.175
Forget daniel.Are you okay, mija?

38:06.175 --> 38:09.675
Yes, papi, I'm fine.I keep telling you.

38:09.675 --> 38:12.488
You wait till your daughtergets caught in a fire with a crazy lady,

38:12.488 --> 38:13.987
see if you take it this well.

38:13.987 --> 38:18.550
Dad, she wasn't crazy.I mean, yes,she is mentally ill,

38:18.550 --> 38:23.331
but I don't know,I sorta kinda understood her.

38:23.331 --> 38:26.863
Just as long as you are absolutely sure you're okay.

38:26.863 --> 38:32.988
Dad... I am fine.I'm fine.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.738
Now I have to go to work.what?

38:36.738 --> 38:37.878
Daniel didn't give youthe day off?

38:37.878 --> 38:42.175
Well, he tried,but I refused.

38:42.175 --> 38:44.128
I really think he's gonna need a friend today.

38:47.863 --> 38:50.784
Betty, wait. Here. It's the stuff I took from "mode."

38:50.784 --> 38:53.925
Oh. Did it work?Not really.

38:53.925 --> 38:56.253
I mean, I told gina off,and I made her feel bad,

38:56.253 --> 38:58.488
and that was cool, but...

38:58.488 --> 39:02.409
you know, she found somebody,and it seemed like they were really in love.

39:02.672 --> 39:08.129
I wish I had that.Hilda, you will.

39:08.129 --> 39:15.050
And for what it's worth,gina might be in love,but she's still trash.

39:15.050 --> 39:19.238
Betty... you always know what to say to make me feel better.

39:26.875 --> 39:32.519
are you okay?I don't know.As long as you're okay.

39:32.519 --> 39:34.425
Daniel...

39:35.594 --> 39:37.800
you know,you're gonna be fine.

39:38.375 --> 39:43.675
You are handsome,and you're successful and kind.

39:44.269 --> 39:47.269
You'll find someone worthy of you.

39:47.269 --> 39:50.925
I just...I really loved her.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.999
You know, amanda says I need to be more sensitive,

39:57.999 --> 40:01.800
and she's right, so I'm not gonna talk about this in front of you.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.253
I'm sorry.

40:04.562 --> 40:07.628
Sensitive?What do you mean?

40:09.500 --> 40:13.375
Well, you know.Um, no, I don't know.

40:13.425 --> 40:15.425
You mean,'causeenry's leaving?

40:15.425 --> 40:17.675
Come on, betty.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.800
I know you have a crush on me.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.862
What?

40:21.862 --> 40:23.050
Look, it was bound to happen.

40:23.050 --> 40:27.112
We're just gonna have to work through it together.

40:27.112 --> 40:29.999
Yeah. You're right.

40:30.563 --> 40:34.988
I love you.I've always loved you.

40:34.988 --> 40:39.253
I can't stop thinking about you.

40:39.253 --> 40:40.268
You're making fun of me.

40:40.268 --> 40:43.690
 No. No, I mean, I just--I wish I could be your morning bag

40:43.690 --> 40:48.847
so I could get caught between your beautiful, beautiful teeth.

40:49.188 --> 40:49.503
come on.

40:49.503 --> 40:52.566
You know I love you,but not like that.

40:53.063 --> 40:55.237
oh, there's the guy i do love,

40:55.237 --> 40:58.316
and I need to go talk to him,so can I be excused, please?

40:58.316 --> 40:59.999
yeah.

41:03.000 --> 41:03.675
betty.

41:03.675 --> 41:06.863
Henry, look,I know about you and gio.

41:06.863 --> 41:10.613
And--and I'm sorry that I didn't just tell you that we were friends again.

41:10.613 --> 41:14.937
I don't want you to be jealous. I love you.

41:14.987 --> 41:16.925
That's all that matters to me.

41:16.925 --> 41:19.362
Betty, you can be friends with whomever you want.

41:19.362 --> 41:22.612
Really? Of course.I'm just glad you're okay.
