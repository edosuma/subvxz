19:31.458 --> 19:32.625
Uh, did you drive down?

19:33.959 --> 19:35.500
Yeah, yeah, I came down
as quick as I could.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.333
Yeah, uh, not much traffic?

19:37.667 --> 19:40.166
No. Who's coming to Capeside?
[LAUGHING]

19:40.166 --> 19:41.417
Yeah, well, you were.

19:42.959 --> 19:44.083
Thanks. I appreciate it.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.041
[SIGHS]

20:09.667 --> 20:11.333
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.542
For what?

20:12.542 --> 20:14.000
Your silence speaks volumes.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.667
No offense, George, but you

20:16.667 --> 20:17.583
don't know me well enough

20:17.583 --> 20:18.834
to know what my silence means.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.166
With Mr. Gold, it means
he's trying to formulate

20:21.166 --> 20:23.542
the best possible way
in which to eviscerate me.

20:23.542 --> 20:24.333
What did he say?

20:26.208 --> 20:27.875
Why won't you talk to me about
my film?

20:29.208 --> 20:30.542
Alright, look.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.250
I'm, I'm new at this, George.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.000
I mean... [LAUGHS]

20:36.542 --> 20:37.875
Do you have any idea
how bizarre it is

20:37.875 --> 20:39.208
to come back to your
old High School

20:39.208 --> 20:40.583
and try and say
something profound

20:40.583 --> 20:41.542
about life on the outside?

20:41.542 --> 20:44.333
No offense, and other
obligatories, but

20:44.333 --> 20:46.875
I'm as ill-suited to
psychoanalyze your

20:46.875 --> 20:48.542
crippling self-doubt
as you apparently

20:48.542 --> 20:50.041
feel you are to
critique my film.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.917
And my Mother serves dinner at
6:00, so...

20:52.917 --> 20:53.917
I'm stalling, George, because I

20:53.917 --> 20:55.083
don't know what to say, alright?

20:55.083 --> 20:56.333
I don't know what to tell you.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.208
I mean, keep going.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.208
You know, your film's good.
It's very good.

21:01.583 --> 21:02.750
Yeah, you got stuff to learn.

21:02.750 --> 21:03.625
I mean, you know...

21:04.417 --> 21:05.083
You could probably
trust yourself

21:05.083 --> 21:05.750
when you go in for shots.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.375
You need to work on continuity,

21:07.375 --> 21:08.625
but other than that, I mean...

21:10.208 --> 21:12.041
The important stuff,
the stuff you can't teach,

21:12.041 --> 21:14.291
is, it's there.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.333
So I'm a natural genius.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.417
There's nothing left for me

21:18.417 --> 21:19.417
in these antiquated halls?

21:19.417 --> 21:21.291
You are so much like me
when I was your age.

21:21.291 --> 21:23.792
Yeah. Mr. Gold said that, too.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.291
Did he?

21:26.250 --> 21:27.250
Well...

21:30.041 --> 21:31.250
Remember this feeling.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.458
George, remember what it was
like

21:33.458 --> 21:35.708
to make a film about
something that you loved.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.125
To have the confidence
to do it your way,

21:38.125 --> 21:39.834
to control your vision,
keep it your own.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.875
I mean, that's...

21:42.125 --> 21:43.333
[SIGHS]

21:44.083 --> 21:45.083
I miss that.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.583
Yeah. You do sort of have the

21:47.583 --> 21:49.625
stink of a burnout
talent on you.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.291
It's scary.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.625
Yeah, I'm a poster child.
Get out

21:54.625 --> 21:56.166
of here before I rub off on you.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.750
I thought it was good...

22:05.583 --> 22:06.458
Creek Days.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.291
Syrupy sweet
with lame music and all that,

22:11.625 --> 22:13.291
but not too many people
have heart anymore.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.917
You can't lose that, right?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.500
Hope not.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.500
Alright.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.875
Stay in school, keep your

22:28.875 --> 22:30.583
nose clean, don't do sports.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.000
Anyway, I blame your Mother,
Pacey.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.208
She got herself
this new cookbook,

22:46.208 --> 22:48.000
Bacon Makes The world Go 'Round

22:48.000 --> 22:49.125
[LAUGHING]

22:50.333 --> 22:51.667
Well, I guess that's
not the worst

22:51.667 --> 22:52.750
concept I've ever heard of.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.166
It is when the bacon is going

22:55.166 --> 22:56.417
on top of the apple crisp.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.417
[LAUGHING]

22:58.417 --> 22:59.875
I think she's trying to kill me.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.041
Which is really funny

23:02.041 --> 23:03.166
'cause you're the only one in

23:03.166 --> 23:04.458
the family who's got any money.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.417
[LAUGHING]

23:09.041 --> 23:09.959
You know, this stuff is serious.

23:09.959 --> 23:11.417
I mean, if you got
heart problems, Pop,

23:11.417 --> 23:12.542
you really gotta
take care of that.

23:12.542 --> 23:13.583
Calm down.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.417
This is nothing. Just a little

23:15.417 --> 23:16.708
exaggerated arrhythmia.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.208
Hell, you probably got the same
thing.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.542
I don't know what your brother's

23:21.542 --> 23:22.542
getting all worked up about.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.625
Well, I think you gave him
a bit of a scare.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.208
He said you went down pretty
hard.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.750
Ah, he's just looking
for some drama.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.291
He needs to get out more.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.250
He needs to get a life like you.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.750
Listen, it can't be
good for you being

23:38.750 --> 23:40.083
away from the office this much.

23:40.542 --> 23:41.875
Well, I'm pretty sure they'll

23:41.875 --> 23:43.625
understand, given
the circumstances.

23:43.625 --> 23:44.917
What about your clients?

23:44.917 --> 23:46.041
You're my father.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.083
[SCOFFS]

23:53.083 --> 23:54.125
You really would do anything

23:54.125 --> 23:55.041
for me, wouldn't you?

23:58.708 --> 24:00.417
Even after everything,
you're still...

24:03.500 --> 24:05.542
You grew up to be one
of the good guys, Pacey.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.125
I always knew you would.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.375
I should've told you that more
often.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.834
Well, maybe I just
didn't always hear you.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.667
Yeah.

24:34.875 --> 24:39.500
[TYPING]

24:39.500 --> 24:40.542
Patrick: [SIGHS]

24:50.959 --> 24:53.000
Joey, I noticed you're reading
Don DeLillo.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.458
White Noise  is one of my
favorite books.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.667
Really? And when in
your 15 years of

24:57.667 --> 24:59.708
life did you manage
to read this?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.458
I'm 16, actually.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.583
I look younger than I am.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.917
I just got my license. You want
to see?

25:06.500 --> 25:09.000
Will you please shut up?
I'm trying to write.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.083
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.125
Joey and I can go
in the other room if you want.

25:12.125 --> 25:12.959
No, we can't...

25:12.959 --> 25:14.166
Patrick, why don't you just
leave?

25:15.125 --> 25:15.792
What's your problem?

25:15.792 --> 25:17.291
Oh, you really have to ask?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.041
I asked you over here to study.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.792
- You and I both know...
- Ok, fine. Whatever.

25:22.291 --> 25:24.000
I asked you over
here to be with me,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.542
not salivate over my babysitter.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.458
I mean, do you have any idea
how gross that is?

25:27.458 --> 25:28.959
Can't believe you still
need a babysitter.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.208
When your parents go out of
town,

25:30.208 --> 25:31.625
don't they make you stay
with the Johnsons?

25:31.625 --> 25:33.834
Yeah, that's just for safety
purposes.

25:33.834 --> 25:34.834
Yeah, so you don't accidentally

25:34.834 --> 25:35.750
choke on your own spittle.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.667
Ok. That's enough
from the both of you.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.708
Can we just forget
about it and move on?

25:39.708 --> 25:41.208
Oh, easy for you to say, Helen.

25:42.125 --> 25:42.834
Excuse me?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.250
You know, the face that launched

25:44.250 --> 25:45.542
a thousand ships and all that.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.333
Get people all riled up and then

25:47.333 --> 25:48.667
go knit somewhere in solitude.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.959
Ok. I think you're mixing up
your epics.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.583
The point is, my boyfriend is

25:53.583 --> 25:55.250
blatantly flirting with you.

25:55.542 --> 25:56.917
Would you really call it that?

25:56.917 --> 25:58.375
Since when am I your boyfriend?

25:58.375 --> 26:00.542
Ugh! I hate you so much right
now.

26:00.542 --> 26:02.000
I hate you with the burning

26:02.000 --> 26:03.542
passion of a thousand STDs.

26:03.542 --> 26:04.875
We haven't had the talk.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.208
No, how could we?

26:06.208 --> 26:08.125
Whenever I try to be
serious with you,

26:08.125 --> 26:10.208
you, like, turn into
some freak of nature

26:10.208 --> 26:11.375
and you do stuff like this.

26:12.208 --> 26:12.917
Like what?

26:12.917 --> 26:14.208
Like staring at Joey all night.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.458
Like selling me out in homeroom

26:15.458 --> 26:16.250
when we were both late.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.375
Like not agreeing
to go to the dance

26:18.375 --> 26:19.875
with me until Lauren
Riley said no.

26:19.875 --> 26:21.250
Ok. The homeroom thing

26:21.250 --> 26:22.542
was because I was trying

26:22.542 --> 26:24.000
to save your reputation.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.250
And the Lauren thing
was purely defensive.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.458
And... I got scared.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.417
I don't know. I was just...

26:31.166 --> 26:32.542
Keeping my options open.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.000
Options. Yeah, well, take me

26:34.000 --> 26:35.375
off your list of options.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.375
That should make things so much

26:37.375 --> 26:39.083
easier for your
tortured, assy soul.

26:45.750 --> 26:46.917
I probably shouldn't have said

26:46.917 --> 26:48.125
that thing about the options.

26:48.375 --> 26:49.375
To begin with.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.375
Hey, there you are. Dougie,

26:51.375 --> 26:52.917
Dad's ready to see you now.

26:52.917 --> 26:53.959
Yeah, that's ok.

26:54.417 --> 26:55.625
Uh, actually, the
nurse said they're

26:55.625 --> 26:56.708
gonna be shutting
down visiting hours

26:56.708 --> 26:58.834
in about 20 minutes,
so we got to get a move on.

27:00.041 --> 27:01.041
Did he ask for me?

27:02.959 --> 27:04.417
What, like did he send for you?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.333
Doug, we're talking
about our Father

27:07.333 --> 27:08.166
here, not the king of England.

27:08.166 --> 27:09.834
He knows we're both here to see
him.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.792
I love the amount of knowledge

27:12.792 --> 27:14.125
you've acquired on Dad

27:14.125 --> 27:15.834
in the hour that you've been
here.

27:16.667 --> 27:17.291
You're starting to throw

27:17.291 --> 27:18.000
around paternal references

27:18.000 --> 27:19.625
like they're going out of style.

27:20.542 --> 27:21.625
Well, you've always
been more up on

27:21.625 --> 27:22.583
high fashion than I have been...

27:22.583 --> 27:26.000
Just don't even start, Pacey,
for once.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.959
I mean, I know you're
all on your game

27:27.959 --> 27:29.625
since dear old Dad's
given you the nod...

27:29.625 --> 27:31.000
Ok, look. Hold on.
What is it that you

27:31.000 --> 27:32.291
actually want to
talk to me about?

27:32.291 --> 27:34.250
Because, from my way of seeing
things,

27:34.667 --> 27:35.500
you and I are just two brothers

27:35.500 --> 27:36.959
trying to take care
of our family.

27:36.959 --> 27:37.959
No, Pacey. I'm the one

27:37.959 --> 27:39.291
taking care of the family.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.250
I'm the one who's been taking

27:40.250 --> 27:41.291
care of the family for years.

27:41.291 --> 27:42.625
Oh, now, Doug, don't you

27:42.625 --> 27:44.125
dare get righteous on me.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.083
You cannot lord your
resentment over

27:46.083 --> 27:47.792
me because that was your choice.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.625
Yeah, I do happen to make
choices.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.875
I know that's a
foreign concept to

27:51.875 --> 27:53.291
somebody who plays
musical careers.

27:53.291 --> 27:54.667
How did we get here?
Am I stepping

27:54.667 --> 27:55.834
on your turf or something?

27:55.834 --> 27:57.166
Are you the only member of the
family

27:57.166 --> 27:58.959
who's allowed to be
caring and compassionate?

27:58.959 --> 28:00.583
What did you expect me to do,
Doug?

28:00.583 --> 28:01.375
Just chomp on my cigar on

28:01.375 --> 28:02.291
the other end of the phone

28:02.291 --> 28:04.291
and cut a check for
the man's funeral?

28:04.291 --> 28:05.667
I'm a member of this family.

28:05.667 --> 28:06.959
Yeah, conveniently.

28:06.959 --> 28:07.834
I mean, that's the way it is

28:07.834 --> 28:08.750
with you lately, isn't it?

28:09.125 --> 28:10.500
You know, you just swoop

28:10.500 --> 28:12.000
in with your fancy gifts.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.208
You just pull the wool over the

28:13.208 --> 28:14.458
whole Witter family's' eyes.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
And then you're out.

28:16.834 --> 28:17.834
And everybody forgets.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.500
Forgets what?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.875
That I'm the family failure?
Am I

28:22.875 --> 28:24.667
just never supposed to grow up?

29:07.708 --> 29:08.875
that the son he ignored for

29:08.875 --> 29:10.208

who checks up on repairs.

38:03.917 --> 38:05.208
I do not know, but sometimes

38:05.208 --> 38:06.250
I feel like I've been

38:06.834 --> 38:07.917
playing the part, wearing the

38:07.917 --> 38:09.000
suit for so long, that...

38:10.542 --> 38:11.917
I may have forgotten how I got

38:11.917 --> 38:12.959
there in the first place.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.792
Yeah. I know you deal
with this more than I do,

38:14.792 --> 38:16.208
but some kid called me "Sir"
today.

38:16.583 --> 38:17.959
[LAUGHING]

38:17.959 --> 38:19.750
- Dawson: What is that?
- I know. It's strange.

38:19.750 --> 38:20.959
Every time I hear "Mr. Witter,"

38:20.959 --> 38:21.959
I look over my shoulder.

38:22.583 --> 38:23.458
Who called you sir?

38:23.458 --> 38:24.458
This kid in my...

38:25.875 --> 38:27.291
I almost said this
kid in my class.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.500
I went to Capeside High today.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.125
What, in your mind?

38:31.125 --> 38:32.291
[LAUGHING] Almost.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.667
Uh, no. I went to go talk to Mr.

38:33.667 --> 38:34.625
Gold's film class.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.000
Get out of here.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.583
[LAUGHING] Really?

38:37.583 --> 38:39.667
I guess that's what they call

38:39.667 --> 38:41.583
coming full circle, huh?

38:42.125 --> 38:43.166
Yeah.

38:43.583 --> 38:44.542
Yeah, I went there.

38:44.542 --> 38:47.792
I was supposed to talk
about where I am now

38:48.750 --> 38:49.792
and the glamour of the real

38:49.792 --> 38:50.959
world and all that, but...

38:53.792 --> 38:54.667
It was weird, Pace. I was

38:54.667 --> 38:55.834
watching this kid's film today,

38:55.834 --> 38:57.000
and all I could think was,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.208
"I don't know anything."

39:00.708 --> 39:01.667
Or maybe I did,

39:01.667 --> 39:05.291
and I just lost it somewhere
along the way.

39:06.834 --> 39:08.041
Yeah, I know what you mean.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.000
Phew. [LAUGHING]

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Being here...

39:15.333 --> 39:16.291
Being at the High School,

39:16.291 --> 39:17.250
all these ghosts around me,

39:17.250 --> 39:20.458
I just, wanna go back.
I wanna start over.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.208
Do things the right way.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.291
Yeah.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.458
Yeah. I'd like the time back.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.041
But I wouldn't have it the way
it was.

39:34.792 --> 39:35.792
[SIGHS]

39:36.792 --> 39:39.375
I just want to pinpoint
that moment in your life

39:39.375 --> 39:40.291
where everything goes wrong.

39:41.583 --> 39:43.250
I'm thinking it was
probably puberty for me.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.291
I could skip that, too.

39:45.834 --> 39:46.875
But if you didn't have all the

39:46.875 --> 39:47.750
great loves of your life,

39:47.750 --> 39:48.583
you wouldn't have anything

39:48.583 --> 39:49.500
to make your movies about.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
True.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.000
Except now that I actually have

39:53.000 --> 39:54.667
enough distance from all that,

39:54.667 --> 39:56.083
and I can actually say something

39:56.083 --> 39:57.375
about the loves of my life,

39:57.375 --> 39:58.708
I can't afford to make movies.

39:58.708 --> 39:59.750
Afford?

40:00.708 --> 40:02.375
Those are the people I cater to,
my friend.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.917
Come on. I'm a wizard of high
finance.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.458
Right, right, right.

40:06.208 --> 40:07.834
I'm the kind of person you prey
on.

40:07.834 --> 40:08.708
[LAUGHING]

40:08.708 --> 40:10.875
Sentimental losers with 10-cent
dreams.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.708
More like 10,000,
but who's counting, right?

40:12.708 --> 40:14.166
I'm sorry, but... [LAUGHING]

40:14.667 --> 40:16.583
You're just freaking me
out there, Mr. Witter.

40:17.875 --> 40:18.750
Alright, we can talk about

40:18.750 --> 40:19.708
that some other time, sir.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.792
Alright.

40:29.125 --> 40:30.708
Listen, I just made some coffee.

40:30.708 --> 40:31.708
Do you want to come in and

40:31.708 --> 40:32.875
sit down for a little while?

40:33.750 --> 40:34.959
It's been a long day.

40:36.750 --> 40:39.625
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that, man.

41:11.959 --> 41:12.959
[SIGHS]

41:28.166 --> 41:29.083
Pacey Answering Machine: Hey

41:29.083 --> 41:30.125
you've reached my cellphone,

41:30.125 --> 41:31.959
sorry I missed you, leave
a message at the beep.

41:34.166 --> 41:35.208
Hi, it's me.

41:36.583 --> 41:38.792
So, I thought that I
would have an answer

41:38.792 --> 41:41.041
when I picked up the
phone, but I didn't.

41:41.583 --> 41:45.125
And then I thought
I would think of something

41:45.458 --> 41:47.667
as I was talking, but, [LAUGHS]

41:48.834 --> 41:49.875
No such luck.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.583
Um... Pace...

41:54.500 --> 41:55.959
I think the problem is trying

41:55.959 --> 41:57.333
to figure this out alone.

41:57.333 --> 41:58.708
I, I think that maybe we
should...

42:00.125 --> 42:01.417
Do it together, you know?

42:03.667 --> 42:04.834
And...

42:05.750 --> 42:06.792
You know how they say if you

42:06.792 --> 42:07.834
could do it all over again,

42:07.834 --> 42:08.917
what would you change?

42:10.458 --> 42:11.458
Well...

42:13.500 --> 42:15.291
I'd probably change a lot of
things.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.542
But I'm also really lucky

42:18.542 --> 42:20.041
that I have the chance.

42:20.667 --> 42:21.708
And...

42:23.500 --> 42:24.667
I guess what I'm saying is

42:24.667 --> 42:26.166
that I'm not gonna look at you

42:26.166 --> 42:28.333
and think of everything
that happened. I'm...

42:31.750 --> 42:33.041
I'm gonna look at you and think

42:33.041 --> 42:34.166
of everything that could.

42:41.542 --> 42:42.667
Call me.

42:44.583 --> 42:45.625
Bye.
