WEBVTT

00:11.140 --> 00:12.929
- Clear!
- Clear!

00:12.930 --> 00:13.970
Whoa!

00:13.980 --> 00:16.340
Go! Go! Go!

00:16.360 --> 00:18.180
Not clear!

00:18.220 --> 00:19.700
Excuse me.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.980
Don't stop, don't stop, don't
stop, don't stop, don't stop!

00:23.000 --> 00:24.710
There we go!

00:24.720 --> 00:26.609
Looks we found our
canaries in a coal mine.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.880
All right, enough of the perv committee.

00:28.890 --> 00:30.780
- Come on, let's go.
- This is gonna last forever!

00:30.790 --> 00:33.260
- Oh, there you go!
- Aah!

00:33.300 --> 00:35.270
- Oh, my God! Get out!
- What the hell?!

00:35.280 --> 00:37.200
Carbon monoxide leak in
the building, folks.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.550
You need to get out.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.360
Okay, well, just give us a
minute so we can finish up.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.000
Are you crazy? There's a gas leak.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.919
Okay. Well, just let us get dressed.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.020
- Okay, come on.
- Come on, let's go.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.240
Hey, disconnect those two
and get them outside.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.290
Andy and I will search
right, you guys go left.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.710
We'll meet at the stairwell in 10.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.080
And keep your mask on.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.389
We don't know how bad this gas leak is.

00:55.390 --> 00:56.580
Copy.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.820
What is wrong with you people?

01:00.830 --> 01:02.300
I am a first responder.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.680
- Yeah.
- Just one quick second.

01:03.700 --> 01:04.840
This only takes one second.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.840
Hey!

01:09.900 --> 01:12.440
Hey, Tony, why did you
kill the music, man?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.380
I'm not Tony. Tacoma FD.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.470
Yeah, right. Nice outfit, dude.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.490
What are you guys doing here?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.530
Gas bongs, brah.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.360
Hello! Anybody home?

01:22.370 --> 01:23.760
Captain!

01:23.780 --> 01:25.120
Okay, ma'am, stay calm.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.980
Oh, my cat.

01:27.650 --> 01:30.800
My cat... Rumpelstiltskin!

01:31.860 --> 01:33.720
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:33.730 --> 01:35.580
Cap, Chief said to keep our masks on.

01:35.590 --> 01:36.980
Do I ever do what he tells me?

01:36.990 --> 01:38.590
Yeah, but Chief's the Chief.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.520
And if he told you to jump
off a building, would you?

01:40.530 --> 01:41.600
I did last week.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.640
Just take her out. I'll get the cat.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.990
Listen to me, fireman.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.200
Let me just blow a little bit
of smoke in your gas hole.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.760
I said no!

01:52.080 --> 01:53.670
What the hell?!

01:53.680 --> 01:55.210
You know this mask is expensive.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, so is this.

01:57.620 --> 01:59.120
That's my weed, man.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.500
Let's go. Get out of here.

02:00.510 --> 02:02.960
- You're a dick.
- Tell it to your barber.

02:02.970 --> 02:03.970
Come in, Chief.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.350
What's up, Ike?

02:05.360 --> 02:06.550
It's Captain Penisi, sir.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.419
He took in a lot of gas.
We have to help him out.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.620
Where's his mask?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.820
He gave it to an old lady, sir.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.220
Ah, come on.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.420
All right, we'll clear the floor.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.090
- You get him outside.
- Copy, sir.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.290
- Out.
- Idiot.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.630
I hope he pukes in the parking lot.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.200
That'll teach him to take his mask off.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.400
Shit, Eddie, come on.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.500
Eddie, I was just kidding.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.120
Look out, look out, look out, look out.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.500
Come on, buddy, stay with me.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.110
Come on, Rumpelstiltskin.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.200
Come on, don't quit on me
now, buddy. Stay with me.

02:38.210 --> 02:39.830
Hey, he's gone, all right?

02:39.840 --> 02:41.330
He had nine good ones, man. Let him go!

02:41.340 --> 02:43.050
Bullshit! Not on my watch!

02:44.370 --> 02:45.960
Stay with me here!

02:49.900 --> 02:51.530
- Ugh!
- Man!

02:54.740 --> 02:56.530
Come on, get up. Get up.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.110
I thought that was you on the ground.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.060
You all right?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.880
It's cool.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.880
Furball. Furball.

Yeah.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.120
Mmm!

03:53.220 --> 03:54.880
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

03:54.900 --> 03:55.950
- Baby!
- Come on!

03:55.960 --> 03:58.870
- Son of a prick!
- Yeah, winner! Losers!

03:58.880 --> 04:00.430
Yeah, whoo!

04:00.440 --> 04:01.560
Winner-loser what?

04:01.570 --> 04:04.270
I bet that you would spill sauce
on yourself on the first bite,

04:04.280 --> 04:05.670
and they guessed the second.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.340
- Thanks, Chief.
- What was the bet?

04:07.350 --> 04:09.470
Loser sleeps in a satin
teddy for a month.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.410
- Ooh.
- That was the bet?

04:11.420 --> 04:13.080
- You guys sound bored.
- Yeah, kind of.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.340
We haven't had a fire in weeks.

04:14.350 --> 04:15.470
That's a good thing, Ike.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.560
- You should get a hobby.
- I got a hobby, Chief.

04:17.579 --> 04:20.550
I do needlepoint. Eh?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.019
- Oh, deer.
- Let me see.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.690
- Oh, that's super cute.
- Thank you.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.220
You should knit yourself a toupee.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.880
That's a funny joke, but
I'm not even bald, so...

04:29.890 --> 04:31.160
But you're starting to bald.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.640
I'm starting to thin, maybe, but no.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.960
So you should knit yourself a toupee.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.880
I mean, it's needlepoint,
so it keeps me calm.

04:39.890 --> 04:41.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you look calm.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.770
Yeah, it looks like
it's calming you down.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.040
Don't aggravate him. There
will be hell toupee.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.510
Maybe both of you guys
should find a hobby.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.790
"Hell toupee."

04:50.720 --> 04:51.830
Hey, why don't you guys play cards

04:51.840 --> 04:52.910
or tell jokes like the old days?

04:52.920 --> 04:54.830
Man, the old days are busted.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.200
What? Jokes are great.

04:56.210 --> 04:57.380
Come on, Andy, tell a joke.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.190
- Chief, I'm not good at jokes.
- You're great at jokes.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.920
Come here. Come on. Let's go, up here.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.840
- Come on.
- Andy.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.230
- Come on, Andy.
- Come on, get up here.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.250
- Do it, man.
- Come on.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.390
Don't be afraid to put
yourself out there.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.660
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

05:07.670 --> 05:08.790
Friendly room, guys.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.400
Come on, Andy.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.100
Everybody gather around.
Myawani's gonna tell a joke.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.560
Come on, man, come on!

05:15.570 --> 05:17.210
Here we go. Wait till we're seated.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.810
- Okay.
- All right.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.120
No opener?

05:23.910 --> 05:25.750
Let's see. Uh...

05:25.760 --> 05:29.670
A pirate walks into a bar with
a ship wheel around his dick.

05:33.270 --> 05:35.070
Bartender says, uh, "You know

05:35.080 --> 05:36.940
you have a ship wheel on your dick?"

05:36.980 --> 05:39.120
The pirate says, "Arr!

05:39.160 --> 05:42.100
It drives me nuts." So...

05:44.380 --> 05:46.680
- Fuck you, guys.
- No, no, no. Wait.

05:46.690 --> 05:47.980
Who put the ship's wheel on his dick?

05:48.020 --> 05:50.320
- What?
- Who put the wheel on his dick?

05:52.550 --> 05:55.030
All right. It was okay.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.380
Hey, what's all this crap?

05:56.420 --> 05:57.550
Gifts for Cap.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.960
- _
- He's a celebrity.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.790
Ah, give me a break.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.980
Hey, check it out.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.080
Nut Nuts Doughnuts
made me cat doughnuts.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.190
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

06:06.200 --> 06:07.790
- Nice.
- Cute.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.550
Siamese cat, anyone? Hmm?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.160
Chiefy, you know you want some.

06:12.180 --> 06:14.660
So what? You save a cat and all
of a sudden you're a star?

06:14.670 --> 06:17.160
Yeah, I'm a hero. Heroes get gifts.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.640
Look at this. Cat mat.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.230
Shock the cat right off
your couch. You'd love it.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.260
That seems terribly cruel and inhumane.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.110
Whatever. Granny revived seven people.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.200
How come he's not on the front page?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.460
Do I have to spell it out for you?

06:28.470 --> 06:29.520
Is it because you're black?

06:29.530 --> 06:32.140
No, you racist. Because
people love cats.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.150
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.170
I love cats.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.820
I love animals you can eat.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.550
Mmm!

06:37.560 --> 06:39.880
- Oh!
- Son of a prick!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.570
- How many times is that already?
- Number two.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.540
Why don't you just slow down
and get it in your mouth?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.860
It's not a speed issue.
I got a big torso.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.420
Sauce naturally falls on it.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.530
By that logic, if we
stuff you into a girdle,

06:49.540 --> 06:50.600
you'll stop spilling.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.760
I don't want to wear a girdle.

06:51.770 --> 06:52.990
- Oh!
- Chief!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.150
Dab it, for God's sake.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.650
You're mashing it all around.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.910
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come on!

06:57.920 --> 06:59.530
Do the whole shirt so it's pink.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.520
All right, all right, all
right, all right. Listen up.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.980
Downtown finally assigned
us a new rookie.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.040
Probie starts today.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.850
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

07:06.860 --> 07:08.380
Come on!

07:08.390 --> 07:09.520
It's about time.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.170
I'm gonna make him go
out to that parking lot

07:11.180 --> 07:13.790
- and kick rocks for no good reason!
- Yeah!

07:13.800 --> 07:15.640
I'm gonna make him pop out
the dents in my Thermos.

07:15.650 --> 07:16.660
Yeah.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.190
Oh, man, I'm gonna make him
feel, like, so uncomfortable.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.040
- Oh, man! It's gonna be awesome!
- Okay, okay, listen.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.160
There are a few wrinkles I
need to talk to you about.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.700
- Hey, Luce, what's up?
- Hey, Dad.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.330
Honey, can you wait
outside for a second?

07:32.340 --> 07:33.580
We have some things we
got to finish up here.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.160
Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.150
Ooh, when the probie gets here...

07:38.180 --> 07:40.490
... I'm gonna make him
renew my passport.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.320
Oh, oh, and we should make
him wear thigh-high boots.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.760
I'm gonna make him call me sensei.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.400
Okay.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.790
- I like that.
- Listen.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.220
There will be no hazing of the probie.

07:54.230 --> 07:55.440
- What?
- Why not, Chief?

07:55.460 --> 07:57.620
Because it's degrading and
it undermines unit cohesion.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.370
What? You love hazing.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.520
I've never supported hazing.

08:00.530 --> 08:01.770
- What?
- Really?

08:01.780 --> 08:03.440
Yeah!

08:03.450 --> 08:04.460
- Yeah!
- How's that, buddy?

08:04.470 --> 08:05.800
You guys, you guys, now
pull him out of there

08:05.810 --> 08:07.340
and let's put his head in the toilet!

08:07.350 --> 08:09.000
I don't know, Chief.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.180
Oh, come on. You guys
are too soft. I'll do it.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.890
Regardless, there will be no hazing.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.100
Chief, what?

08:14.110 --> 08:15.330
- Come on.
- This is ridiculous!

08:15.340 --> 08:17.370
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Now you're getting this back.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.970
- You're kidding, right?
- Come on.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.190
Coming from you, that's rich.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.950
- It doesn't add up.
- This is the worst.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.180
Yeah, well, that's how it's gonna be.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.100
Is Lucy the new probie?

08:27.740 --> 08:29.280
I wanted to talk to you guys about that.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.600
- Chief.
- Um...

08:30.610 --> 08:32.120
And you're just telling us now?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.360
Don't act surprised. You knew she was

08:33.370 --> 08:34.370
in the training program.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.570
I thought she was going
for a desk job downtown.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.840
Well, she wants to be a firefighter.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.390
Yeah, but, Chief, she's a girl.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
Yeah, so what?

08:41.409 --> 08:43.809
Well, we've never had a girl
firefighter before, sir.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.300
There are plenty of stations
with female firemen.

08:46.310 --> 08:47.390
Get used to it.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.800
Says the biggest chauvinist here.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.200
- Oh, I'm a chauvinist?
- Yeah.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.030
That's ridiculous. I
have three daughters.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.280
But you always said that
women can't be firefighters.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.460
I have never said that.

08:55.470 --> 08:57.940
Unbelievable. Look at
Seattle... girl firefighters.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.000
Ha.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.890
What are they gonna do,
paint their trucks pink?

09:02.230 --> 09:04.910
They'll probably get lost
on the way to the fire.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.280
What would your mom think about that?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.240
That was a long time ago.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.540
That was last year.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.760
Plus, we only have one bunk room.

09:11.780 --> 09:12.810
Where is she gonna sleep?

09:12.820 --> 09:14.330
In Afghanistan, the men and women

09:14.340 --> 09:15.570
slept in the same barracks.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.840
Yeah, well, this isn't Afghanistan.

09:16.850 --> 09:18.550
You sure? Because it seems to me

09:18.560 --> 09:20.110
you want your daughter to wear a burka.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.130
What's that supposed to mean?

09:21.140 --> 09:22.220
You don't know what a burka is?

09:22.230 --> 09:23.550
- You can't see their face.
- Yeah.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
- Just their eyes.
- Yeah.

09:24.570 --> 09:25.890
They're like women ninjas.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.940
I know what a burka is!

09:26.960 --> 09:28.240
Do you know what a ninja is?

09:28.260 --> 09:30.760
Okay, so, what if I'm overcome by smoke

09:30.780 --> 09:33.390
and I have to be carried down
three flights of stairs?

09:33.400 --> 09:36.270
I'm 210 pounds of pure muscle, Chief.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.550
You do the math.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.030
Do you know 210 pounds of muscle

09:39.040 --> 09:41.080
weighs the same as 210
pounds of fat, right?

09:41.100 --> 09:43.640
Yeah, no, everybody knows
that muscle is heavier.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.760
- Ah.
- What about farting?

09:45.780 --> 09:47.000
There will be no more farting.

09:47.010 --> 09:48.420
- Oh!
- What?

09:48.450 --> 09:50.850
- That's all I do.
- Yeah, now, you're gonna ban farting?

09:50.860 --> 09:52.960
- Yeah, so what?
- Here we go, guys, ready?

09:53.020 --> 09:55.000
Oh!

09:55.010 --> 09:56.520
That's great! This is what I wanted!

09:56.560 --> 09:59.140
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah, you love farts!

10:02.900 --> 10:04.760
You fart all the time, Chief.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.280
We call your office the Fart Hut.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.000
- No farting.
- Whoa, Chief, I can't stop farting.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.320
Do you have any idea how
gassy creatine makes me?

10:11.340 --> 10:12.520
Then stop using creatine.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.440
Fuck no, brother!

10:14.470 --> 10:15.590
No way!

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
Yeah!

10:18.780 --> 10:20.420
And there will be no more swearing.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.520
Oh!

10:26.820 --> 10:27.990
That's what we love about this pla...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.110
Hey!

10:29.120 --> 10:31.500
Lucy, welcome to the station.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.700
Ugh! Are you just telling them now?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.200
No.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.360
No, no, no, no.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.190
I knew this was gonna
happen. Look, I get it.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.740
You guys are worried that I'm
gonna bust up the sausage party.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.740
What?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.280
Stop. This is a fire station.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.180
You talk about sports, you play pranks,

10:49.200 --> 10:50.460
you make fun of the bald guy.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.640
And Uncle Eddie talks about
how much he likes a finger

10:53.650 --> 10:55.800
up his ass during sex and
calls it his tingle button.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.850
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

10:56.860 --> 10:58.010
- Whoa!
- I've never heard that.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.640
T.M.I.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.710
Who told you about the tingle button?

11:00.720 --> 11:02.570
It doesn't matter. Everybody knows.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.580
Whoa, whoa.

11:03.590 --> 11:05.660
I also know you guys don't
think I'm strong enough.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.460
- What?
- No, no.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.460
I guarantee at least one
of you pulled the old

11:10.480 --> 11:12.880
"what if she has to carry me
down a flight of stairs?"

11:14.920 --> 11:16.380
No one said that.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.520
Regardless, I'm a part of the team now,

11:18.530 --> 11:20.460
and I just want you to think
of me as one of the guys.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.140
Then, uh, see you in the showers.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.540
Not if I see you first.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.930
What?

11:27.940 --> 11:29.010
All right, everybody get to work.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.640
Hit the road. Enough sitting around.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.310
We got things to do. Hurry up.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.020
- Grats.
- Thank you.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.110
What the hell, Dad? Why
didn't you tell them?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.520
Yeah. Why didn't you tell us?

11:38.580 --> 11:39.820
Why are you here? She's my daughter.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.580
Yeah, and I'm her uncle and the captain,

11:41.590 --> 11:42.820
and now she's on my crew.

11:42.840 --> 11:43.900
I got it, Uncle Eddie.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.320
Dad, I know you're
embarrassed that I'm joining

11:46.340 --> 11:48.190
your pranky little fart club over here,

11:48.220 --> 11:49.570
but you have to accept it.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.750
All right. First, if you're
gonna be a firefighter,

11:51.760 --> 11:52.990
you lose the attitude.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.020
And you call me Chief.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.000
Perfect.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.480
That's the way it should be.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.640
All right, now, I'm gonna
go grab my bunk, Chief.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.300
Mm.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.010
- What are you doing?
- What?

12:06.020 --> 12:08.460
If you don't treat her like a
firefighter, no one else will.

12:08.470 --> 12:09.590
Yeah, thanks. Why don't
you just worry about

12:09.600 --> 12:10.650
the new rules, Captain?

12:10.660 --> 12:12.590
Which rules? The no-farting,
no-swearing rules?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.790
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.420
Then go fuck yourself, fatso.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.000
That includes fight farts!

12:21.320 --> 12:22.550
She's a firefighter.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.600
You better figure out how
to get on board with that.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.780
- It stinks in here.
- Good.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.350
Son of a prick! Every time!

12:37.360 --> 12:38.620
Mm!

12:38.630 --> 12:40.380
Who makes a cat-shaped doughnut anyway?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.000
Mm, mm.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.000
Hmm.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.930
_

13:08.110 --> 13:12.150
_

13:20.960 --> 13:22.590
_

13:31.960 --> 13:33.280
Oh, wow.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.260
Ooh, ooh. Hey, look at this girl.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.890
- What?
- Yeah, buddy.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.430
What site is this? I'm signing up.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.400
Oh, no, it's for guys
with thinning hair.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.180
- It's called Thinder.
- Thinder?

13:45.210 --> 13:47.040
I thought that was the one
with the really thin girls.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.160
No, that's Wafer.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.310
Thinder's the one that has
Jude Law as the spokesperson.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.940
- Ooh, Jude Law?
- Yeah.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.510
I liked him in "Young Pope."

13:53.520 --> 13:55.000
Yeah. I wish he was older.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.940
What if I just, like,
thinned my hair out

13:57.950 --> 13:59.260
and take a profile pic like this?

13:59.270 --> 14:01.210
- It looks like I'm balding, like...
- Uh, no, no, no.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.280
They keep watch for impost-hairs.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.240
- Imposters?
- Impost-hairs.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.420
- Who keeps watch?
- The fuzz, man.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.160
You messing with me?

14:10.170 --> 14:11.490
- I am.
- Yeah.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.640
Hey.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.170
You guys come up with
any good hazing ideas?

14:14.180 --> 14:15.900
Cap, it's the Chief's daughter.

14:15.910 --> 14:16.910
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.980
She's a legacy.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.820
I'm a legacy, and I got
hazed relentlessly.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.270
Yeah, but, Cap, she's a girl.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.940
That girl was an All-American
judo champ in college

14:24.950 --> 14:26.500
and could kick all of our asses.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.080
I'd like to see her try.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.390
Now, let's welcome her to the
station with a friendly prank,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.460
and let's be creative about it.
Ike, what did we do to you?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.870
Covered my dick in birdseed and
hung a bird feeder off it.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.820
All right, we can't do that.
Andy, what did we do to you?

14:38.850 --> 14:40.500
Shaved my nuts and then
put peppermint patties

14:40.510 --> 14:42.440
- in my underwear.
- Oh, yeah.

14:42.450 --> 14:43.790
- That was good.
- That was good.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.160
Yeah, we can't do that one either.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.410
All right, Granny, how
about you? What did we do?

14:46.420 --> 14:47.570
Oh, you don't remember?

14:47.580 --> 14:49.210
You buttered the shower floor,

14:49.220 --> 14:52.050
videotaped me flopping
around all greasy and naked,

14:52.060 --> 14:54.380
and then you sent the tape to
my brother at Camp Pendleton.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.460
You know how awkward
it was at Christmas?

14:57.470 --> 14:59.340
- Seemed funny at the time.
- It's still funny now.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.860
Do we just do dick stuff?

15:00.880 --> 15:02.160
Yeah.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.440
I think we need to come up with
some equal-opportunity hazing.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.420
Wait, we can do the
peppermint patty thing.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.570
In the meantime, though,
let's do the ram-a-doodle.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.610
- Oh, Cap!
- Yes!

15:10.620 --> 15:11.970
- Come on!
- Are you kidding me?

15:11.980 --> 15:13.370
- Come on.
- Ram-a-doodle's great.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.380
What's wrong with the ram-a-doodle?

15:14.390 --> 15:17.140
- It's awesome.
- The ram-a-doodle's busted.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.330
Lucy!

15:38.340 --> 15:39.930
Lucy!

15:39.940 --> 15:41.780
Uh, coming!

15:41.860 --> 15:43.860
Hey, Luce!

15:44.020 --> 15:45.960
Lucy!

15:46.600 --> 15:48.380
Lucy!

15:49.950 --> 15:51.690
Lucy!

15:53.070 --> 15:54.130
Hey.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.830
Um, could you go out there
and get the ram-a-doodle?

15:56.840 --> 15:58.250
The ram-a-doodle?

15:58.260 --> 16:00.840
Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, right out
the garage and to the right.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.420
- You'll see it.
- Okay.

16:02.430 --> 16:03.550
It's lying right there
around the corner.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.620
- You can't miss it.
- Great.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.740
- Today, please.
- Come on, probie.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.590
Oh, hey, Chief, do you mind showing me

16:07.600 --> 16:09.010
where the outside water hookup is?

16:09.020 --> 16:10.920
Uh, yeah, it's out here.

16:12.060 --> 16:15.900
- No, no, no, no!
- Chief! Chief!

16:15.920 --> 16:17.420
Oh, shit!

16:17.440 --> 16:19.680
Myawani, you're scraping toilets!

16:19.720 --> 16:22.240
Chief, th... w... d...

16:22.250 --> 16:23.340
Ugh!

16:23.350 --> 16:24.390
I'm sorry.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.460
What the hell is this?

16:25.470 --> 16:27.380
- The ram-a-doodle.
- I know it's the ram-a-doodle.

16:27.390 --> 16:28.850
I've been ram-a-doodled
a thousand times.

16:28.860 --> 16:30.850
A thousand one.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.050
I said she was off-limits!

16:32.060 --> 16:33.180
Why am I off-limits?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.510
- 'Cause you are. You're off-limits.
- Chief, she's a rookie.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.980
She gets pranked, she does grunt work,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.260
she gets a dumb rookie nickname
just like the rest of us.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.760
- Thank you.
- Off. Limits.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.530
All right, shitface. Good job.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.310
- You're gonna fit right in here.
- I grew up here.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.170
You think I don't know
what the ram-a-doodle is?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.200
If you're gonna come at me,
you better come correct.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.740
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

16:53.750 --> 16:54.760
It's on.

16:54.770 --> 16:56.240
Yes. Awesome.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.590
What's my dumb rookie nickname?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.010
That'll come in time.

16:59.020 --> 17:00.800
All right, well, what was yours?

17:00.860 --> 17:02.280
Come on, Tingle Button.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.650
Of course. What was my dad's?

17:04.660 --> 17:05.770
No, can't.

17:05.780 --> 17:07.680
- That I'm not saying.
- Tuna Can.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.720
- Oh, Granny.
- Come on, Granny.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.020
Why? 'Cause he likes tuna?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.240
Uh, sure.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.630
- Yeah, that's it.
- He loves it.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.680
It's because his junk is
wider than it is long.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.500
Oh, God damn it!

17:17.510 --> 17:18.700
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

17:18.710 --> 17:19.740
- That...
- It's gross.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.780
- Stop picturing it.
- Ugh. Oh.

17:21.810 --> 17:23.310
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

17:23.319 --> 17:24.770
Go outside if you're
gonna throw up, okay?

17:24.780 --> 17:26.290
- Lucy!
- Yeah, coming.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.300
- Don't look him in the eyes.
- Lucy!

17:29.320 --> 17:31.390
Oh.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.880
What's the matter?

17:32.900 --> 17:34.390
Nothing.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.500
I'm just trying to get something
gross out of my head.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.960
All right, well, I made a decision.

17:40.990 --> 17:42.640
I'm transferring you to another station.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.450
What?

17:44.460 --> 17:45.860
It's better for both of us.

17:45.870 --> 17:47.540
I'll get the process started.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.650
Station 24, all units respond.

17:53.660 --> 17:56.530
- Load it up!
- Possible fire in assisted-living center.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.380
All units respond.

18:01.590 --> 18:03.030
Here you go, Chief. It's all set up.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.190
Thank you, Captain Penisi.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.320
You are a real hero.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.920
Aww. Hey, let's take another one.

18:12.930 --> 18:14.020
Just in case. Come on, go.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.080
Come on, Chief. He doesn't mind.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.170
He's a monkey wrench, this guy.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.320
Cheese.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.460
- Chief, it's all good.
- Oh, that's great.

18:19.470 --> 18:21.060
Someone just left their hot plate on.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.260
- False alarm.
- Excuse me, Chief.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.660
We're having another...

18:24.670 --> 18:28.080
issue, which requires
emergency medical assistance.

18:37.790 --> 18:40.480
Geez. Where did he get the Viagra?

18:40.890 --> 18:42.750
I can't see out my right eye.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.870
We're not exactly sure where he got it.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.620
We assume it was bought
from another resident.

18:47.630 --> 18:48.900
Does he have any Propecia?

18:48.980 --> 18:51.090
- Andy!
- I'm kidding, Chief.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.450
I don't really need it. I mean,
that stuff is expensive,

18:53.460 --> 18:56.160
but it's more of, like,
preventative for me.

18:56.170 --> 18:58.390
You know what I mean?
Obvious... Obviously.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.100
- Yeah.
- My arm is numb.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.900
What you're experiencing is a priapism.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.500
The blood flow to your phallic region

19:03.510 --> 19:04.740
is impairing your circulation.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.230
How many pills you take?

19:06.240 --> 19:07.250
Eight.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.600
Eight? Most I can handle is four.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.580
I was supposed to have a big night,

19:11.590 --> 19:14.400
a three-way with Ruthie and Louise.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.820
Oh, Randall.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.130
You know Louise passed away last week.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.200
That's what you think.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.520
Sir, we're gonna have
to take care of that

19:21.530 --> 19:22.890
before it causes permanent damage.

19:22.900 --> 19:23.920
What's that?

19:23.980 --> 19:25.900
Oh, we have to aspirate the erection.

19:25.940 --> 19:28.210
We draw the blood and
then we inject the member

19:28.220 --> 19:29.260
with epinephrine.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.060
What?

19:32.070 --> 19:34.800
Tradition is low man on the
totem pole does the job, Chief.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.010
I'll do it.

19:38.020 --> 19:39.980
Terry, chiefs don't aspirate dicks.

19:39.990 --> 19:42.150
- This one does.
- If it's my job, I'll do it.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.140
- No, you won't.
- It's rookie tradition.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.380
If she wasn't a woman, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.780
She's not a woman. She's my daughter.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.420
I've seen a penis before, Chief.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.550
- No, you haven't!
- And I've touched a penis before.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.930
- No, you haven't!
- I vote for her.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.220
Don't touch that dick. Don't
you touch that penis!

19:56.250 --> 19:58.400
- Now we're talking.
- Don't you touch that dick!

19:58.420 --> 20:00.960
Let go of the dick!

20:00.970 --> 20:02.900
- You let go of the dick!
- Ooh!

20:02.910 --> 20:04.500
- Get off the dick!
- Chief, come on.

20:04.510 --> 20:06.100
- Let go!
- Let go of the dick!

20:06.110 --> 20:08.060
Don't talk to me like that!
It's not your daughter!

20:08.460 --> 20:11.410
Aaah!

20:15.440 --> 20:16.980
Anything else, Chief?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.320
Mm.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.980
Um, don't.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.830
Hey.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.610
Hey.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.880
I'm going to, uh, I'm
gonna grab a bite to eat

20:33.890 --> 20:35.750
and then head home.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.650
Cool.

21:03.150 --> 21:04.940
You did a good job today.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.410
You handled it like a professional.

21:06.430 --> 21:07.650
Pun intended.

21:08.620 --> 21:09.930
What pun?

21:11.030 --> 21:13.270
Never mind.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.220
Come on.

21:17.230 --> 21:21.990
Hey, um, I was thinking about
what you said earlier today,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.230
and I think you're right.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.510
I can go anywhere, and I'm
just an added stress for you.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.690
Uh, I was thinking about that too.

21:29.730 --> 21:32.800
And, um, I don't think that
I could trust anyone else

21:32.810 --> 21:36.650
to teach you properly,
so you're staying.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.710
Really?

21:37.810 --> 21:39.590
You mean it?

21:40.860 --> 21:43.670
Yeah. I want you here.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.950
Ah, come on. Ah!

21:47.970 --> 21:51.250
Hey, uh, you want half of my sandwich?

21:51.270 --> 21:52.930
Yeah, you sure you got enough here?

21:52.940 --> 21:55.100
Oh, I think so.

21:56.470 --> 21:59.050
Awesome. Thank you. Cheers.

22:03.050 --> 22:06.470
Oh, son of a prick! Every time!

22:06.480 --> 22:08.770
Oh, come on, you people are savages.

22:08.850 --> 22:12.070
Of all the traits you
inherited from your dad,

22:12.080 --> 22:13.610
that one is the worst.

22:14.950 --> 22:16.390
Dab it, for Christ's sake.

22:17.230 --> 22:18.880
What is wrong with you people?

22:18.890 --> 22:19.930
Go to bed!

22:19.950 --> 22:22.820
- I'm going.
- We're having a moment.

22:22.830 --> 22:24.760
Gonna hose you slobs down.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.930
Get it? It's a firefighter joke.

22:26.950 --> 22:28.260
- Pretty good, though, right?
- Yeah.

22:28.270 --> 22:29.300
Yeah.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.700
Free Willy. More like let's
cover these feet up.

22:35.710 --> 22:38.970
You know, it's actually
pronounced whh-ale.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.370
Did you know that?

22:42.330 --> 22:44.030
Oh, yeah!

22:44.070 --> 22:45.840
- Yeah!
- Oh, God.

22:45.850 --> 22:47.470
- So good.
- You like that, huh?

22:47.480 --> 22:49.220
Yes! I love it!

22:49.230 --> 22:50.850
What happened, guys? Did you lose a bet?

22:50.860 --> 22:53.250
Yeah. Yeah, got to wear
these for a month.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.120
I don't get it. What's the punishment?

22:55.130 --> 22:57.050
We have to wear girls' clothes.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.610
And aren't they comfortable?

22:58.620 --> 23:00.970
Actually, it's unbelievable.

23:01.030 --> 23:02.740
- Yeah.
- Soft. It's so soft.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.110
- Yeah, it's really soft.
- See?

23:04.130 --> 23:05.390
Girls' clothes aren't that bad.

23:05.430 --> 23:07.110
Not at all. Asshole!

23:07.130 --> 23:08.770
Hey, man! I hate feet.

23:08.810 --> 23:10.130
Hey, hey, anyway.

23:10.170 --> 23:13.250
Lucy, you had a great first day today,

23:13.260 --> 23:14.760
and we wanted to commemorate that

23:14.770 --> 23:17.450
by giving you your
official rookie nickname.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.630
- Yes!
- Yeah.

23:18.670 --> 23:21.980
Lucy McConky, you're
officially known as...

23:21.990 --> 23:24.530
- Chunk Light.
- There it is.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.990
Wait, wait, wait. Why Chunk Light?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.010
Don't get it?

23:27.020 --> 23:28.940
Because you come from the Tuna Can.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.740
You remember, right? Your dad's dick?

23:30.750 --> 23:33.160
Oh, come on. I just got over this.

23:33.170 --> 23:36.460
But, uh, we also want to say truce.

23:36.470 --> 23:38.410
You know, no more
pranks, no more hazing.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.230
We'll just end it now, cool?

23:40.240 --> 23:41.770
I think that's a great idea.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.440
- Cool. Truce.
- Oh, man.

23:43.450 --> 23:44.450
Thank you.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.469
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

23:45.470 --> 23:47.840
- Truce.
- Glad we're past that.

23:47.850 --> 23:50.210
That was good, though. That was good.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.500
Hey, thank you, guys, so much for making

23:53.510 --> 23:55.010
my first day so special.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.920
- You kidding me?
- It was a pleasure.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.250
Y'all are the best.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.650
Night, guys.

23:59.710 --> 24:00.770
Good night.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.730
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

24:07.740 --> 24:09.660
Whoa! Whoa!

24:09.670 --> 24:11.390
Cat mat, bitches!

24:11.400 --> 24:14.070
Whoop-whoop!

24:14.080 --> 24:15.930
Chief!

24:16.510 --> 24:17.590
Good night.
