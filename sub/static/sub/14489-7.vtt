00:21.356 --> 00:23.358
People, as company bureaucrat,

00:23.441 --> 00:27.111
I will today be conducting
the annual performance review.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.280
With a twist.

00:29.572 --> 00:30.573
(ALL GASPING)

00:30.823 --> 00:32.784
Oh, no. The firing tie.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.537
Correct. I will be
evaluating each of you,

00:35.620 --> 00:38.164
and the lowest-rated employee,
possibly Zoidberg,

00:38.248 --> 00:40.583
will be fired at sundown.
Zoidberg.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.670

00:43.753 --> 00:47.298
Let the interviews begin. Good
luck, everybody but Zoidberg.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.301
My Primary duties?

00:50.385 --> 00:54.222
Well, I assist the Professor
in whatever important research

00:54.305 --> 00:56.391
he happens to be engaged in.

00:56.766 --> 00:57.767
(SNORING LOUDLY)

00:58.309 --> 01:03.648

that science lamp right away.

01:04.524 --> 01:06.776
(SNORING)

01:11.072 --> 01:12.949
Now, Leela, couldn't
we just fire you

01:13.074 --> 01:14.951
and have Fry or
Bender fly the ship?

01:15.034 --> 01:18.079
Not if you stand on their
air hose much longer.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.330
Noted.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.166
(BENDER YELLING)

01:23.501 --> 01:26.796
My job? Toilets 'n' boilers,
boilers 'n' toilets.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.673
Plus that one boiling toilet.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.967
Fire me, iffen you dare.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.267
Now, then, while many
of you do half-ass jobs

01:39.350 --> 01:43.938
and the rest do jobs whose ass ratio
ranges from 42% to a mere 11%,

01:44.022 --> 01:47.775
only the most pathetically useless
employee will be fired today.

01:47.859 --> 01:49.944
And that employee is...

01:51.529 --> 01:52.989
Hermes Conrad.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.198
What?
No way!

01:54.282 --> 01:55.283
Hermes, no!

01:55.450 --> 01:59.120
Yes. My performance review proves
the main drag on our profit

01:59.203 --> 02:01.581
is the time I waste on
performance reviews.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.374
But you can't
fire yourself now.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.209
We were just getting
to know each other.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.503
I've already notified
the central bureaucracy.

be here two seconds ago.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.260

to tell me to pack it in?

Only if you buy
me dinner first.

(LAUGHING)

02:19.724 --> 02:20.892
I'm being fired.

02:21.059 --> 02:23.311
I don't think it's appropriate
to joke around like that.

02:23.394 --> 02:24.646
You're right, Hermes.

02:24.729 --> 02:28.358
Meet Mark 7-G, the machine
who's replacing you.

02:28.483 --> 02:31.736
I'm Mark 7-G, the machine
who's replacing you.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.822
(SIGHING) Will you be
conducting an exit interview?

02:34.906 --> 02:37.950
Well, I wouldn't say no to a
little friendly debriefing.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.707
Bureaucrat Conrad, you are ordered
to relieve yourself of duty.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.459
Sounds like a party.

02:49.879 --> 02:50.922
Goodbye.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.133
(SIGHING)

03:02.850 --> 03:04.352
Well, this is it.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.312
But I want you to
know working here

03:06.437 --> 03:08.356
has been
the experience of a lifetime.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.982
Off you go.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.196
So, I hear you're a machine...
Ow!

03:15.279 --> 03:16.322
Traitor!

03:16.406 --> 03:18.991
My friend's ample tuchus
is barely out the door,

03:19.075 --> 03:21.494
and you're already schmoozing
up to his replacement?

03:21.577 --> 03:22.870
Um, Zoidberg?

03:22.954 --> 03:24.580
I don't think
Hermes really liked you.

03:24.664 --> 03:27.834
In fact, he hated you more
than anyone ever hated anyone.

03:27.917 --> 03:32.130
What, you mean the remarks and the hits?
That was just friend teasing.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.549
You don't understand.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.343
He was the only one
who cared enough to insult me.

03:37.427 --> 03:39.554
I insult you, you fat sack.

03:39.637 --> 03:43.891
Sure, when it's convenient. But
Hermes was always there for rne.

03:43.975 --> 03:48.146
And now he's gone, thanks to you, Mr.
Bigshot 7-G.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.942
I'll never see Hermes again.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.781
On the bright side,
I'll never see Zoidberg again.

03:59.490 --> 04:03.828
There, there, husband. I made
your favorite, curried goat.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.455
It better be spicy.

Not bad.

I just don't know
how we'll get by.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.619
Then I guess this wouldn't be a good
time to tell you that I'm pregnant.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.745
What?

04:45.828 --> 04:46.913
And you're not the father.

No!

See now? Things don't seem
so bad anymore, do they?

04:54.545 --> 04:56.547
You're right.
Thank you, LaBarbara.

04:56.631 --> 04:58.925
Oh, also, I wrecked the car.

Me don't think so.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.528
You calling me crazy?

05:18.611 --> 05:21.739
Ain't nothing crazy about rne but my brain.
Right, brain?

05:21.823 --> 05:26.118
Right! No, not you, right brain.
Right, left brain? Right!

05:26.536 --> 05:28.162
Okay, then.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.831
Do something, Hermes.

05:29.914 --> 05:34.043
I can't! When I fight machinery,
machinery always wins!

to the electromagnetic chair.

Stop! It's driving me sane!

become an executioner.

and wear a cool hood.

Nah, I like my
victims to know who did it.

the whole package fits neatly in the

07:45.675 --> 07:49.845
I'm kind of a harpoon snob, and let
me say, that thing is gorgeous.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.348
But do you really
need chest artillery?

07:52.431 --> 07:53.641
It's not just a weapon.

Good old Hermes.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.562
When he stops insulting,
that's when I worry.

08:39.645 --> 08:40.855
Oh, dear!

08:40.938 --> 08:44.608
I was leaning over the sink
eating pureed clams

08:44.692 --> 08:47.361
when my teeth
fell in the disposal.

could you retrieve them?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.254
Oh, no. No more implants.

emotionless machine like you.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.508
That's sweet, Hermes.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.219
Maybe I should
get an extendo-arm.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.562
How long will it take to
install an extendo-arm?

Thank you, Hermes.

09:35.076 --> 09:37.453
I don't know. it seems
like a lot of trouble

09:37.578 --> 09:39.914
to cut off your arm
just to snake a drain.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.832
It's not just a drain snake.

No way.

But, Hermes,
old friend, didn't you say

09:54.637 --> 09:56.639
you were through
with the implants?

09:56.722 --> 09:58.808
Oh, don't be
such a spoilsport.

them away, shall I, why not?

hear what you think.

else that's Jamaican."

10:46.147 --> 10:48.899
Well, I must admit
it's not bad.

10:48.983 --> 10:52.319

a day off my cornrowing routine.

never be the same.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.215
is the difference
between you and a robot?

11:54.298 --> 11:57.384
I still have one thing
no robot shall ever have.

11:57.468 --> 12:00.846
A good old
flesh-and-blood human brain.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.890
Yes, a big, smart brain.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.893
Not like dum-dum Zoidberg,
right, Hermes? Right?

12:05.976 --> 12:09.313
Mecha-Hermes has no interest
in such nonsense.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.072
Mr. Conrad, did you remember
to save the trimmings for me?

12:18.155 --> 12:20.115
Yes, yes, Doctor. Right here.

12:24.078 --> 12:27.373
Wait. You're not eating my
discarded flesh, are you?

12:27.456 --> 12:29.583
How could you even
ask such a thing?

12:29.667 --> 12:32.878
Of course I tried eating you,
but your flesh was too spicy.

12:32.962 --> 12:35.881
Thanks to years of LaBarbara's
curried goat, no doubt.

12:35.965 --> 12:38.759
But my mecha-stomach
has no need of goat.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.720
Mecha-Hermes has spoken!

12:41.971 --> 12:43.264
Mecha-Hermes
still wants to know

12:43.389 --> 12:44.723
what you're doing
with his pieces.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.643
Something wonderful.

did you enjoy the show?"

13:39.570 --> 13:40.988
Alas, no.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.241
Seeing what I once was
filled me with regret.

13:44.325 --> 13:46.577
You could always
undo your implants.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.163
Regret that I still
have one human part.

13:49.246 --> 13:54.668
That meat puppet disgusts me. It's
time for the ultimate upgrade.

13:54.752 --> 13:57.338
But the only thing you haven't
upgraded is your brain.

You can't do this thing. You don't
even know whose brain that is.

It doesn't matter.

And commence
living without me.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.595
Because I will commence

I'm using that word correctly.

Oh, I can't do this, Hermes.
