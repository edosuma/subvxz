00:21.600 --> 00:24.000
Steven, it's 7-damn-30
in the morning.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.960
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.880
Red, be nice.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.480
Steven, we're waiting.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.440
Oh, I've been living
in the basement.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.320
You know, I did notice a dusting
of curly hair on the floor...

00:40.400 --> 00:43.280
but I just wrote it off to
my changing teenage body.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.520
I moved back in when
my dad got transferred.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.080
Transferred?
He's a bartender.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.120
Where'd he get transferred to,
the jukebox?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.640
You know, Red, if it's cool,
I'd kinda rather not talk about it.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.120
Well, Steven, it's important
to get these things out in the open.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.560
Kitty, let him
do what's natural...

01:06.640 --> 01:08.840
and keep his feelings
bottled up.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Attaboy.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.800
Well...

01:14.880 --> 01:17.200
Welcome back,
Steven.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.800
You know, maybe we can
spruce up your old room...

01:19.880 --> 01:21.920
since I decided
to redo the basement.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.440
What? You're redoing
the basement?

01:25.520 --> 01:27.880
Well, honey,
no one uses it.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.680
I use it.
Every day.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
It's my Batcave.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.480
I'll find you
a good, cheap contractor.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.480
Oh, no, no, no. This is something
I want to handle myself.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.440
- This is going to be expensive, isn't it?
- Maybe.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.560
Don't you like
anything cheap?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.480
I like you.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.160
Yeah, I'm gonna
miss it down here.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.080
A lot of good times.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.680
I broke my foot
climbing out of this dryer.

02:40.960 --> 02:45.200
Yeah, I hit my head playing handball
with the soap in that shower.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.880
Me and Jackie totally did it, like,
a bajillion times on this old sofa.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.640
Michael, that's private.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.000
I got news for you.
It wasn't that private.

03:05.280 --> 03:10.160
Oh, my God! That is
the biggest spider I have ever seen.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.960
I think it had a rat
in its mouth.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.280
Okay, I think maybe the basement
isn't the place for me after all.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.880
Oh, you know what, Mom?
I think you might be right.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.680
I mean, not only is it bug-infested,
but in all honesty...

03:26.760 --> 03:28.640
I think it
might be haunted.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.920
Get out.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.720
That's spooky.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.200
I don't know, Mrs. Forman.
I mean, sure, it's a pit now...

03:44.280 --> 03:48.640
but if you paint, fumigate and get rid
of Eric, this could be a great room.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.080
Hey, wh...
Hey, okay.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.000
You're not
my girlfriend anymore. Okay?

03:54.040 --> 03:55.920
So you don't get an opinion
on my stuff now.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.920
Mom, don't listen to her.
She's crazy.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.600
Wait, I disagree with you,
so I'm crazy?

04:01.680 --> 04:04.960
I think the last time I disagreed
with you was the sanest thing I ever did.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.000
Okay, are you referring
to our breakup?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.680
Because I must remind everyone that she wore
my promise ring around her neck.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.800
That's crazy.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.839
Ring, finger.
Finger, ring.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.520
- Well, you're lucky I didn't shove the ring up your ass.
- Mom!

04:25.560 --> 04:28.280
All right. Wait.
Who said, "Get out"?

04:34.360 --> 04:37.760
Anyway, Mrs. Forman, we have a bunch of
decorating magazines at home.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.040
- I'll bring 'em over.
- Well, thank you, Donna.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.400
And I think that ring
looked nice around your neck.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.560
Donna, what the hell?
What, we're not going out anymore...

04:49.640 --> 04:51.640
so you don't
like my basement?

04:51.720 --> 04:53.560
Well, I guess now that
I'm an ex-girlfriend...

04:53.640 --> 04:55.480
I'm free to tell
the truth.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.400
Free at last!
Free at last!

04:57.480 --> 04:59.320
Whoo!

05:01.400 --> 05:04.520
- Michael, get Eric some ice.
- Why?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.960
For that wicked burn!
Burn, Eric! Burn!

05:15.200 --> 05:18.160
Oh, happy day.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.800
Your friend Fez has taken his love of dance
to its logical conclusion.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.720
I have joined
a ballet class.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.000
Man, no offense, but you're,
like, one good cry away...

05:31.040 --> 05:33.680
from being
the total woman.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.560
Oh, really? Well,
would a total woman...

05:37.640 --> 05:39.760
have her own
pink satin slippers?

05:50.200 --> 05:53.320
Oh, Red, here. Um,
meet our contractors.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.920
This is Theo and...

05:55.960 --> 05:57.880
Hey, Mr. Eric's Dad.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.840
This is who you hired
to redo our basement?

06:03.920 --> 06:08.120
Well, no, no.
Actually, I hired Theo.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.920
And, uh, I didn't
really expect Leo.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.720
That was, um...
That was a bonus.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.600
Here.
Shoo, Leo.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.560
Don't worry, ma'am.
Leo is solid.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.880
And he's not allowed to
touch anything electrical.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.280
Kitty, I hate to
interfere...

06:29.360 --> 06:31.440
I understand
your concern, sir.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.120
But I'm not an irresponsible
screwup like my cousin Leo.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.040
That's true, man.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.880
I used to be like Leo, sitting
around all day, wasting my life.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.800
But then one day
the smoke cleared.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.560
See, Red?
He had an epiphany.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.480
Actually, I ran out of weed,
and the smoke cleared.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.240
But, uh...

06:56.280 --> 06:59.280
Then I saw how trashed
my apartment was, so I rebuilt it.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.520
Been a contractor
ever since.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.200
Well, I'm sold.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.880
Okay, Donna, when did you
stop liking my basement?

07:16.920 --> 07:20.720
I never liked it. There were a lot of things
I kept to myself when we were dating.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.720
Yeah, well...

07:22.800 --> 07:25.120
there were plenty of
things I kept to myself.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.960
Plenty.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.360
Like what,
for instance?

07:32.440 --> 07:35.320
I'm sure Donna would
like to know.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.520
Yeah, like what,
for instance?

07:39.600 --> 07:41.800
Well, like...

07:41.880 --> 07:44.520
Why don't...
you just start first?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.760
Okay.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.560
You know how when you eat, and you
smack your lips in that really cute way?

07:50.640 --> 07:52.560
Yeah.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.360
It's disgusting.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.720
That's all you got?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.680
No. You have
tiny wrists.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.800
What?

08:08.760 --> 08:10.640
No, I don't.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.160
Mom, do I have
tiny wrists?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.920
No, not tiny.
Dainty.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.520
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>No, no.</i>

08:20.600 --> 08:22.960
The doctor always said
you were in the normal range.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.480
See? Normal,
Big Bone Magoo.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.600
Ooh. That's nice.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.720
You don't have to
tell me.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.640
It's really cool you're here.
Most men won't take ballet class.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.760
Oh, my pet,
most men are not Fez.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.220
This whole basement thing
is Donna's fault.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.020
I mean, what's her problem?
She's been messing with me all day.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.940
- It could be payback.
- For what?

10:01.980 --> 10:04.860
Well, she had to see
you naked for two years.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.540
That must've
been unpleasant.

10:11.620 --> 10:15.740
You know, for a guy who's been orphaned
twice, you <i>really</i> lack compassion.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.660
Speaking of
hurtful things...

10:21.500 --> 10:24.420
Hey, where's
your dad, man?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.460
Okay.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.540
He, uh...

10:28.620 --> 10:30.460
He went to work
for the police...

10:34.340 --> 10:37.900
developing high-tech handcuffs
to restrain people with tiny wrists.

10:59.780 --> 11:03.100
Hey, uh,
puffy-shirt guy called.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.300
He wants his puffy shirt back.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.580
Things at ballet class have
taken a turn for the worse.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.900
Somehow, I've become
one of the girls...

11:18.020 --> 11:19.940
a hairy, brown girl.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.980
Hey, uh, Fez...

11:25.060 --> 11:27.420
does that shirt come with
its own bicycle pump?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.820
You should talk.
That shirt makes you look like...

11:30.900 --> 11:32.740
a stick of
Fruit Stripe gum.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.980
God, what did you have
for breakfast this morning...

11:39.060 --> 11:41.300
Carnation Instant Bitch?

11:46.140 --> 11:48.100
Okay, that one
was out of the park.

11:48.180 --> 11:51.220
I am so bored with you two.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.860
You know what? I actually
want to talk about Fez.

11:53.940 --> 11:58.060
Fez, why don't the women
at ballet love you?

11:58.140 --> 12:02.100
I don't know. They let me touch
their thighs but not their hearts.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.700
You know what might help?

12:06.780 --> 12:08.980
If you dressed
a little more masculine.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.420
Hey, Hyde, you know what
my favorite ballet is?

12:11.460 --> 12:13.420
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>

12:22.580 --> 12:24.540
Hey, guys.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.700
Don't you think it's time to knock off?
You know, maybe forever?

12:27.740 --> 12:30.500
Yeah, well, we're not done yet.
Don't let us get in your way.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.420
Do whatever
you'd normally do.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.660
This is what you normally do?

12:45.740 --> 12:48.780
I used to do this, too,
back when I was being an artist.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.980
I love art.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.180
But I hate work.
But...

12:56.260 --> 12:58.500
I love art.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.420
But I hate work.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.420
Do you hear that, Forman?

13:03.460 --> 13:05.620
Theo's an artist
who hates work...

13:05.700 --> 13:07.580
and who at this moment...

13:07.620 --> 13:10.860
is very open to suggestion.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.980
Oh. I gotcha, Hyde.

13:16.060 --> 13:19.220
Theo, cluck like a chicken.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.340
Do it. Ow!

13:23.100 --> 13:25.140
Oh.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.140
Theo, if you're unhappy,
and I hope you are...

13:28.220 --> 13:30.300
you gotta be true
to yourself.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.860
Give up construction, man.
Go back to art.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.460
You broke up with Art?

13:39.420 --> 13:41.420
I don't know
what Eric's problem is.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.860
I wasn't being a bitch,
was I?

13:43.900 --> 13:48.660
Oh. Donna, I know from bitch,
and yes... yes, you were.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.980
But I feel much
closer to you now.

13:57.580 --> 14:01.460
All right. Okay.
I know what's going on here.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.540
You're being mean to Eric
because you wanna do it with him.

14:05.980 --> 14:08.020
When Jackie dumped me,
I had a buttload...

14:08.100 --> 14:10.380
of leftover "wanting to
do it with her" feelings.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.940
Oh, my God.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.900
You morons
might be right.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.260
But why do I have these
stupid feelings left over?

14:23.340 --> 14:25.380
I just want to be
friends with him now.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.380
What a child.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.940
So innocent.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.580
You're never gonna
be friends with him.

14:34.660 --> 14:38.500
The only reason he was friends with you
was so he could do it with you.

14:40.020 --> 14:44.380
Really? So he made friends
with me when I was five...

14:44.460 --> 14:48.020
so he could do it
with me when I was 17?

14:48.060 --> 14:50.900
Well, that and your
sweet Big Wheel.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.940
Okay, off to
ballet class now.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.020
More masculine, yes?

15:11.900 --> 15:14.340
Okay.
We're all done.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.700
But you've only
been here a day.

15:19.780 --> 15:22.740
Well, you know what they say:
Rome was built in a day.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.220
No. Uh, "Rome wasn't
built in a day."

15:31.300 --> 15:34.620
Oh? Well, your basement
was built in a day.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.580
Ta-da.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.540
Y-You didn't
do anything.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.780
It's a commentary.

15:58.860 --> 16:02.700
See, you wanted to change your basement
into something that it wasn't.

16:02.780 --> 16:06.940
So instead of giving you something
that you thought you wanted...

16:07.020 --> 16:10.980
I gave you something
that you needed.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.060
Red, I think
my contractor's on dope.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.620
No need to thank me.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.340
Oh, we won't.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.340
Because you didn't
do anything, hophead.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.020
Look! It's art!

16:43.220 --> 16:45.420
I moved everything
in this basement...

16:45.500 --> 16:47.860
two inches to the left.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.700
Oh, yeah.

16:53.780 --> 16:57.020
I call it "Basement...
Two Inches to the Left."

16:59.460 --> 17:01.940
It's wild, huh?

17:02.020 --> 17:04.500
I mean, it's like...
Where are you?

17:09.819 --> 17:11.700
All right.

17:13.020 --> 17:17.460
Mrs. Eric's Mother
would like you to leave now.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
Okay, you don't get it.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.300
But when your life shifts
two inches to the left...

17:25.380 --> 17:27.260
you're gonna
call me.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.980
Oh, yes. You are
gonna call <i>me!</i>

17:33.820 --> 17:37.500
And if you like our work,
tell your friends, okay?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.580
Well, well, well.

17:47.620 --> 17:50.780
- Look who finally got his basement back.
- Yep.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.900
Outwitted two hippie burnouts.

17:54.180 --> 17:56.060
Walk tall.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.380
So, hey, Hyde.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.140
Come on.
Where's your dad? Really.

18:06.220 --> 18:08.460
Fine. You want to know?

18:08.540 --> 18:10.940
He and my mom
got back together.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.940
No way.
No way.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.060
That's great.
So, where are they?

18:16.420 --> 18:18.340
I can't tell you.

18:18.420 --> 18:21.700
- Why not?
- 'Cause they won't tell me.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.540
They split on you?

18:28.940 --> 18:30.780
Oh, man.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.180
Oh, man. See, this is why
I didn't wanna tell you.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.660
I knew you'd get all
<i>After School Special</i> on me.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.100
Me?

18:45.180 --> 18:47.140
Please.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.060
It's okay.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.620
You're home now.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.660
- Get off me, man.
- No, you let me love you, orphan boy!

19:05.940 --> 19:07.860
Don't hide
from your feelings!

19:20.580 --> 19:22.700
- So, hey.
- Hey.

19:22.780 --> 19:25.100
Look, I'm sorry
I've been so...

19:26.220 --> 19:28.900
Bitchy?

19:28.980 --> 19:32.500
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.
Who said "bitchy"?

19:32.580 --> 19:35.980
Yeah, well, it turns out
that there are some...

19:36.060 --> 19:38.620
lingering feelings
or something.

19:38.700 --> 19:42.900
Not real feelings...
just, like, lingering urges.

19:44.860 --> 19:48.900
But they're just lingering feelings.
They're not actual feelings.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.900
I just wanna make that
very clear.

19:50.980 --> 19:54.580
You have. By using the word "lingering,"
like, six times.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.460
Okay.

19:59.980 --> 20:02.940
And the basement's
actually really cool.

20:03.020 --> 20:05.740
And your wrists
are very wide.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.860
Hmm.

20:17.940 --> 20:21.540
Um, there must be some way
to break the tension here.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.860
Oh, I know.
Let's just have sex.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.220
- Okay.
- Really?

20:28.300 --> 20:30.220
No. See ya.

20:32.540 --> 20:35.540
Like I wanted to.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.380
I did want to.
