00:35.000 --> 00:36.120
Fuck's sake.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.360
About time.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.000
What the fuck?

01:36.320 --> 01:39.840
Wow, banging his teacher. Respect.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.240
I was proud of myself when I accidentally
touched Mr. Smith's arse in assembly.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.680
I'm gonna talk to him.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.600
Is that wise?

01:46.680 --> 01:47.880
The state of you...

01:47.960 --> 01:49.280
You'll end up taking his head off.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.920
Jenny's got herself involved in something.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.160
She's not in on it alone.
This kid's got something to hide.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.560
I'll come with you.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.880
Is that wise?

01:57.960 --> 01:59.200
Hey, I'm fine.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.600
You don't look fine.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.120
I'm not. I'm exhausted.
I was just trying to be macho.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.080
Just go rest.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.880
- I'll call you when I've spoken to him.
- All right.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.600
Christ.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.240
loan!

04:04.640 --> 04:08.760
For Christ's sake. What? Leave me alone.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.000
Right.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.440
Piss off!

04:36.880 --> 04:38.360
Do you think I'm stupid?

04:38.440 --> 04:40.640
I can tell when I'm being followed.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.640
And, frankly, I'm not in any state.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.520
Okay? Physically, mentally,
to deal with this shit.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.640
I nearly died
helping Tom find his daughter.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.040
So, whatever it is you think I've done,
I haven't.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.080
All right? Get back in your car,

04:55.160 --> 04:59.160
drive back to your station
and look for someone else to haunt.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.560
You're my dad.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.360
That is not how I wanted to tell you,

05:09.440 --> 05:11.480
or how I imagined it, but...

05:14.040 --> 05:16.600
My mum's Corrina...

05:17.280 --> 05:19.840
your girlfriend at med school.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.920
Well, she was.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.960
She died.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.280
I came here to find you.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.600
I visited you when you were
in the hospital,

05:33.680 --> 05:35.240
when you were unconscious.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.040
Sat by your bedside,
hoping to God that you wouldn't...

05:46.600 --> 05:48.080
I'd love a hug.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.640
Actually, a little bit slacker.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.680
- I've got stitches.
- Sorry.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.120
It's okay. It's okay.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.360
The police requested all the CCTV
from the day of the fire.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.400
They needed to see everyone that went in
and everyone that went out.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.240
I suspect they're following up leads
even as we speak.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.920
- Wanna drink?
- No, thanks.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.600
So, the police have taken all the disks,

06:39.680 --> 06:43.080
so there's no way of checking on a vehicle
that might have entered that day.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.000
No, I didn't say there was no way
of checking.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.480
I have backup.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.840
But I can't be giving out information
that might affect a criminal prosecution.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.320
Todd, I just need to know

06:53.400 --> 06:55.640
when a particular vehicle
entered the community.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.480
It might have nothing to do with the fire.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.120
"Might." Key word.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.240
I don't fancy two years
at Her Majesty's pleasure

07:04.320 --> 07:06.280
for perverting the course of justice.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.320
Do your employers know
you're an alcoholic?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.480
Alcoholic? Oh, this is just...

07:11.560 --> 07:13.000
The residents might be interested.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.040
Right.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.520
- It's like that?
- My daughter's in trouble,

07:18.600 --> 07:21.280
so right now, yes, it's exactly like that.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.480
Show me where to look, then step outside.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.840
You were never here.
The conversation didn't happen.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.760
Okay?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.800
I hadn't really
come out at that point.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.960
I was still trying to convince myself
I was straight, but...

07:35.040 --> 07:36.280
I knew.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.560
I mean, I knew.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.000
I don't know. Maybe I thought I was bi.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.320
Sorry. You don't wanna hear all this.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.600
No, I do.

07:48.880 --> 07:49.920
Anyway,

07:51.120 --> 07:52.440
your mum...

07:53.440 --> 07:54.680
Corrina and me...

07:55.560 --> 07:56.840
We were...

07:59.440 --> 08:00.640
I loved her.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.080
She was my best mate.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.400
But I think she knew, deep down...
I think she knew what I preferred.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.720
Did you not think it was weird,

08:12.800 --> 08:15.360
when she quit,
just left and didn't come back?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.360
She made her excuses.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.440
She said she hated her course,
and I bought into them.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.600
Perhaps part of me was relieved
she was the one breaking it off.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.840
We kept in touch for a bit on the phone,

08:28.920 --> 08:31.760
but, at that age, things just fade away.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.039
How did you find me?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.480
I'm a detective.

08:39.558 --> 08:42.280
No, but, I mean, it's so long ago.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.240
Mum always said that my dad
was a one night stand,

08:47.320 --> 08:49.440
that he'd never be part of my life.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.200
Right.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.760
I just accepted that.
I never thought of pursuing it.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.720
It was her sister, my aunt, who told me.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.080
She took me aside at the funeral

09:01.160 --> 09:03.640
and said mum hadn't told me
the gospel truth.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.480
She couldn't remember your exact name.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.840
She said Pete Maypole.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.640
It's close.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.360
But she knew that you were
in the same year at med school,

09:14.440 --> 09:16.720
so it didn't take much detective work.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.400
I found out you were a medic,
that you'd been in the army.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.920
I was glad you were someone good.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.960
But this was four years ago.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.480
So, why now?

09:41.520 --> 09:42.680
I'm pregnant.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.320
First a dad...

09:48.400 --> 09:49.720
now a granddad.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.240
Things are moving quickly.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.040
Congratulations.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.400
The father...

10:03.480 --> 10:06.200
my boyfriend, Max, he...

10:08.280 --> 10:10.960
We met on the job, but...

10:12.640 --> 10:14.120
What happened?

10:14.600 --> 10:15.920
He was killed.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.120
Line of duty.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.440
I'm sorry.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.920
And something about being alone,

10:36.200 --> 10:39.520
losing someone else, it made me realize,

10:40.960 --> 10:42.800
for me and the baby...

10:45.120 --> 10:47.000
I need you in my life.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.840
I hope I'm not a disappointment...

10:53.720 --> 10:55.120
in the flesh.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.520
I think we need each other, don't you?

11:27.360 --> 11:28.560
I hope you find her.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.760
loan.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.840
loan.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.840
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

11:42.920 --> 11:45.200
- You lied to me.
- What?

11:45.280 --> 11:47.040
About the night of the party.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.160
About what you were doing
and who you were with.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.800
Which means you're the person
with the most to hide.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.320
Or she is. Your teacher?

11:57.080 --> 11:58.520
Did Jenny know?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.680
Did Chris?

12:01.640 --> 12:03.280
What aren't you telling me?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.760
Tom... Mr. Delaney...

12:07.400 --> 12:09.320
She didn't know, I swear.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.440
No one knows.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.080
Zoe's husband does.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.000
What?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.160
- Shit.
- The night of the party,

12:17.240 --> 12:20.000
- did Jenny see you going out to her?
- No.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.080
Well, she saw me just before, but...

12:24.640 --> 12:25.600
What?

12:26.640 --> 12:27.680
Details!

12:30.200 --> 12:32.160
She texted me. Zoe.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.320
She was waiting outside,
but I was desperate for a pee.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.560
So, I'm upstairs banging on the door.

12:40.880 --> 12:41.720
When it finally opens...

12:41.800 --> 12:44.000
- Fuck's sake.
- About time.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.200
It's Jenny.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.360
She's got this weird look
on her face, troubled.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.320
But I'm bursting, so I...

12:49.400 --> 12:52.280
head into the toilet
and someone else comes out.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.720
What the fuck?

12:55.560 --> 12:56.400
Henry.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.640
I don't know what they were doing,
but they didn't see me and Zoe.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.800
No one did.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.240
Henry.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.120
I'm just making a drink.
Would you like anything?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.160
Uh, no, thanks.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.920
Actually, is Henry home?

13:35.480 --> 13:38.640
Henry? Yeah, he's upstairs
with Ellen and Carrie. Why?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.640
What's up? What do you want him for?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.480
Straight question.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.000
And I'm asking this as a friend.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.400
"A friend."

13:48.480 --> 13:50.240
As me to you.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.920
Do you think he's telling the entire truth
about the night of the party?

13:56.360 --> 13:58.200
Yes, I do. Why wouldn't he?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.200
I'm worried he's holding something back.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.840
Where did you get this from?

14:01.920 --> 14:05.160
I'm worried he might know more
than he's admitted about Jenny,

14:05.240 --> 14:07.520
about whatever she's involved in.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.960
Well, he doesn't.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.480
I've asked. We've been through it.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.200
I'd be able to tell if he's lying.
He's a crap liar.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
He's not lying. I'd know.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.920
Can I talk to him?

14:17.960 --> 14:20.240
I know the place you're in right now...

14:20.320 --> 14:21.840
He was in the toilet with Jenny

14:21.920 --> 14:24.000
at the party,
and something went on in there.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.840
- Says who?
- loan.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
loan.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.680
Look, Tom, I'm completely exhausted,

14:32.760 --> 14:34.640
and I've got about an hour
until I have to...

14:34.720 --> 14:36.880
Five minutes, a couple of questions.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.880
No.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.960
He's a sick kid.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.840
Now, you have to believe me.
He's got nothing more to tell us.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.320
Have you got company?

15:09.400 --> 15:10.280
She was just leaving.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.600
She?

15:18.400 --> 15:19.240
You knew.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.000
Yeah. Listen...

15:22.080 --> 15:23.160
Don't worry.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.480
I'm too happy to be mad at you.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.120
I've got a little girl.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.680
I wanted to tell you.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.760
Hey, I get it. It wasn't your place.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.400
What happened with loan?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.800
loan? What's this?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
My daughter, the copper.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.360
He's pointing the finger at Henry.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.520
He says he and Jenny
were acting suspicious at the party.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
What, deflecting?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.440
No, I believe him.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.240
So speak to Henry.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
Yeah, I tried to.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.120
Sophie wouldn't let me.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.240
She totally blocked it.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.080
It's like she was protecting him.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.760
Do you want me to speak to him?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.840
In a professional capacity?

16:07.880 --> 16:10.000
Yeah. That'll please her.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.360
Oi, sleepyhead.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.400
Oh, man.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.640
I've gotta go back to work.
I need you to look after the kids for me.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.840
The least you could have done
is brought me a beer...

16:27.920 --> 16:29.480
Hey!

16:30.040 --> 16:32.400
They're inside. Carrie's still here.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.640
All right.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.640
So, Bobby comes
into the community in his car,

16:45.280 --> 16:47.320
which has altered plates.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Suspicious.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.440
Parks it up outside an empty house.
Double suspicious.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.960
And then leaves.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.120
What do you think, by foot?

16:56.200 --> 16:57.680
Presumably.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.040
Yeah, but it's not gonna take the cops
long to track that, is it?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.400
They've got the CCTV.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.640
They'll be logging everyone

17:04.720 --> 17:08.319
that came in and went out
either side of the fire.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.880
Who drives somewhere, miles from
where they live, and leaves a car?

17:14.839 --> 17:16.598
Someone who's got something to hide.

17:21.358 --> 17:22.760
Oh. Hi.

17:24.358 --> 17:25.880
I need to question Henry,

17:26.680 --> 17:29.120
as part of the Chris Chahal
murder investigation.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.880
And I think, for transparency,

17:31.960 --> 17:33.840
it's better
if I do it down at the station.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.800
Are you arresting my son?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.400
I'm not arresting him.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.160
It's just voluntary questioning.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.800
Voluntary?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.680
Well, in that case, I decline.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.040
Okay, fine, I'll arrest him then.
Is that what you want?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.440
I'm calling Sophie.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.360
Stay.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.560
Oh, used to love this song.
Great video. You remember?

18:12.640 --> 18:13.960
No, oddly, it's slipped my mind.

18:14.040 --> 18:18.920
It had these semi-naked dancers in masks,
writhing around.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.080
It really stayed with me.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.240
- Yeah, I'm looking for Bobby.
- He's not here.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.040
Any idea where he is?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.400
Not a clue.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.320
Has he been around today? Jesus.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.040
- Are you all right?
- It's all right. I got stabbed.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.080
He's, um...

18:35.160 --> 18:37.640
No, no, I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.640
So, he was here yesterday?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.360
I just told you he was here yesterday.

18:42.040 --> 18:42.960
Alone?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.000
Guys, he's not here, okay?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.120
- Unless you want a drink...
- Oh, okay.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.360
Yeah, thanks.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.200
We'll have two beers
and whatever you're having.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.240
Staff-only keypad entry.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.000
There's a table next to it.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.720
Okay, you get the beers.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.360
This is ridiculous
and you are out of order.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.800
Henry, get in my car. I'm taking you home.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.080
Obstructing an investigation
because it's your son...

19:23.160 --> 19:24.280
Go to the car now, and you.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.080
Mum, I don't mind.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.360
It's just routine questioning,

19:27.440 --> 19:28.920
based on information received.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.680
What, from Tom? From my fucking...
Well, whatever he is.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.720
What, and you couldn't call me, no?
You couldn't ask my permission?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.400
I went to your house. Procedure.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480
Car. Now.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.360
Sophie, you can't do this.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.960
If you do, I'll have no option
but to go over your head.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.120
Fine, I wanna be there with him.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.280
You know that's not possible.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.600
What about me?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.640
Can I be in there?

20:05.440 --> 20:06.680
Eight-four-eight-five-eight-six.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.120
How very thematic.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.680
Are we both going, or...

20:11.440 --> 20:12.680
is it just you?

20:12.760 --> 20:14.280
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

20:14.840 --> 20:17.280
you take a knife to the gut.
See how brave you feel.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.840
Someone comes, call me.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.280
I want to go through the events
of Saturday, the 2nd of September.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.760
Specifically, Sia Marshall's party.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.960
And I'd like you to answer
as thoroughly as possible,

22:04.040 --> 22:07.000
including any detail,
no matter how seemingly irrelevant, okay?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.280
- Are you okay?
- He's okay.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.680
He's okay. Aren't you?

22:13.920 --> 22:15.320
Let's just get this over with.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.280
There's nothing to be scared about.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.520
Could you tell me about any contact

22:20.600 --> 22:23.720
that you had with Chris Chahal
the night of the party?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.360
Um...

22:26.040 --> 22:27.800
Chris was wasted.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.640
He got into a fight.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.320
Uh, some kid badmouthing his mum.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
Mike Lloyd-Powell. Uh...

22:37.120 --> 22:40.840
I dived in, not even thinking,
tried to break them up.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.200
Uh... I got blood all over me.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.400
And that was it. That was me and Chris.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
You're doing good.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.640
Soon be done.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.600
What about Jenny Delaney?

22:51.400 --> 22:52.960
What contact did you have with her?

22:53.720 --> 22:59.560
Uh, we saw a bit of each other
at various points, had a drink, chatted.

23:00.120 --> 23:00.960
Anything else?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.240
Like what?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.720
Anything more intimate?

23:05.800 --> 23:08.000
No. No.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.960
Only, we have information
that would suggest

23:12.040 --> 23:14.080
you were seen exiting
the bathroom together.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.520
And that Jenny seemed quite upset.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.480
Right. Yeah. Well, yeah, we did.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.080
And why would that be?

23:22.920 --> 23:25.800
It's quite unusual, even at a party,

23:25.880 --> 23:28.160
to be sharing a bathroom
with a girl, isn't it?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.480
Not in my experience.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.720
Henry?

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
Well, it's, um...

23:36.040 --> 23:38.560
She'd... It's just...

23:39.240 --> 23:41.720
What? What, Henry?

23:42.440 --> 23:43.880
Just tell her the truth.

23:45.080 --> 23:45.960
Uh...

23:46.040 --> 23:48.400
- Chris Chahal was murdered.
- I know.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.640
Murdered, Henry, at that party.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.800
It's not about his murder!
I don't know anything about his murder!

23:53.880 --> 23:55.000
Then talk to me.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.280
I'm good with tech, yeah? Phones, apps.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.520
Jenny had seen this weird thing
on her phone.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.000
It's a replica calendar.
You'd hardly notice it,

24:06.080 --> 24:07.400
but she mentioned it to me.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.400
And, um... well, I delved around a bit
on her phone.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.640
And, uh...

24:14.000 --> 24:16.960
Well, it became obvious that...

24:17.720 --> 24:20.240
What? What?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.440
Someone was spying on her.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.360
- A cloning app?
- Mmm.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.480
It takes your messages, uh, texts,
not WhatsApp,

24:27.560 --> 24:29.200
and pings 'em to another account.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.720
Well, it means someone can read
every message you send or receive.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.800
Who the fuck has done that?
Who the fuck would do that?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.640
And who did she think was responsible?

24:42.400 --> 24:45.600
Um... her dad or Chris.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.800
They were the only people who had access
to her phone.

24:48.880 --> 24:49.920
Um...

24:50.000 --> 24:51.480
She chose her dad.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.400
Started ranting about him, um...

24:54.040 --> 24:56.640
about how he wasn't even there
when her mum died,

24:56.720 --> 24:58.720
about how he was with my mum.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.920
She, uh...

25:00.000 --> 25:04.120
Um, started calling them
both all kinds of...

25:04.200 --> 25:06.200
all kinds of fuckers,

25:06.280 --> 25:07.960
and then she started on me.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.960
She started... She started, uh...

25:12.040 --> 25:13.000
She started saying...

25:13.080 --> 25:14.040
It's all right, mate.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.400
Oh, shit. He's having a seizure. Fuck!

25:22.480 --> 25:23.440
It's okay.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.200
It's okay. It's all right.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.040
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.440
What are you doing? Get an ambulance now!

25:37.880 --> 25:39.560
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.000
- Excuse me.
- I was just... I was just...

25:42.080 --> 25:43.560
'80s theme.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.760
That's brilliant. Whose idea was that?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.400
The owner. Sorry, I need to get past.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.600
That's gotta be weird for you,
though, right?

25:49.680 --> 25:52.160
Working in an '80s bar,
when you were born in...

25:52.240 --> 25:55.240
No, don't tell me,
'cause I've got this skill

25:55.320 --> 25:57.640
where I can guess anyone's birth year.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.960
Here's a clue.
It's a long time after yours.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.280
Okay. Bollocks.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.080
Oh.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.880
- Hello?
- Incoming.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.120
Hide.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.680
You trying to get yourself killed?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.040
He's dangerous.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.840
What do you mean? Why say that?

27:27.920 --> 27:30.120
- Go.
- Have you seen my daughter?

27:30.200 --> 27:31.480
- Is she with him?
- Trust me.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.720
Get out of here.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.800
- Did she see you?
- We need to get out of here.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.360
- What happened?
- I don't think we're safe.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.200
Eric!

27:59.280 --> 28:00.120
Eric!

28:01.600 --> 28:02.640
Eric!

28:02.720 --> 28:03.680
Sorry.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.720
Wait!

28:10.440 --> 28:11.440
What?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.200
What?

28:13.280 --> 28:16.360
Mate, a guy just came out, old guy.
Which way did he go?

28:16.440 --> 28:17.960
Oh, um...

28:18.600 --> 28:20.000
That way.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.760
Which way? Did he go to another bar?

28:22.840 --> 28:24.440
That's classified information, that.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.120
Prick. You go that way.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.360
I'll go this way. Call me if you see him.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.520
- You got him?
- No.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.880
Let's use logic, mate.
He's not young. He's not fit.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.160
There is no way he's done the 100-meter
sprint outside that bar.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.760
So, where did he go?

29:11.760 --> 29:12.880
I'm doubling back, mate.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.360
Okay, I'll circle the block
and meet you back there.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.920
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.080
Eh?

29:34.160 --> 29:35.000
Prick, was it?

29:35.080 --> 29:36.800
What? Oh, God.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.840
Come on, mate.
No, that was just banter.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
- Banter?
- Yeah, just a little bit of, um...

29:42.000 --> 29:43.880
- Just a playful insult, yeah.
- Oh.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.600
I'll tell you what.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.480
Call me something. Go on.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.640
- Dickhead.
- Ah.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.480
You can do better than that.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.040
Fuckwit.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.600
Mmm...

29:56.040 --> 29:58.600
- Gaylord.
- Now you're talking.

30:01.720 --> 30:04.200
- Let yourself in, man.
- See you later.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.640
- All right?
- All right.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.960
How you doing?

30:25.040 --> 30:27.120
- Good. How are you?
- Good, yeah.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.120
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.520
No sign.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.000
Why "don't call"?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.120
Found him.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.480
What did he say?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.240
I didn't talk to him.
I think he's meeting someone.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.960
I mean, what if it's Bobby?

31:13.040 --> 31:15.240
One of the staff was giving him a message.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.440
- I don't understand. Why...
- We can follow him.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.440
I slipped my phone in his pocket.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.920
We use your phone to trace mine.
See where it leads us.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.720
Yeah.
One, two, three, push. Yeah.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
This is you.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.880
This is all on you.
I told you that he wasn't up to it.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.040
If anything happens...

31:44.920 --> 31:46.080
Take a seat there.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.600
Shit. Looks like
he's just going back home.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.360
At least we can corner him.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.440
You think we should go to this
other place Bobby owns, Bar Exile?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.360
How far is it?

32:13.800 --> 32:14.960
Wow.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.280
What?

32:16.360 --> 32:20.120
First hits.
"Bar destroyed in arson attack."

32:20.680 --> 32:22.360
- Arson?
- Yeah.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.520
Totally destroyed.

32:25.920 --> 32:29.160
And he was in the community
the day Helen's house went up.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.280
Where Bobby goes, fire follows.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.440
Sophie.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.160
Hi.

32:37.640 --> 32:38.680
Henry's collapsed.

32:38.760 --> 32:41.400
We've just arrived at your hospital.
Can you come, please?

32:41.480 --> 32:42.680
Of course.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.680
You sent her, didn't you? Emma?

32:44.760 --> 32:46.560
You sent her to question him.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.480
Well, she pushed him too hard.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.160
I'm sorry, Sophie.
I'm really sorry.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.760
I'm just scared.
Can you just come, please?

32:56.080 --> 32:57.360
Shit.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.320
Your girlfriend hates my daughter.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.200
Who'd have thought
we'd be saying that sentence?

33:08.440 --> 33:09.760
Someone to see you.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.680
Jojo.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.480
I know we've been through this before.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.960
But a boy doesn't just appear dead
in a pool at a party.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.840
Okay? So we must be missing something.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.240
I want you to walk me,

33:22.800 --> 33:26.400
very slowly, through every moment
of that evening,

33:27.160 --> 33:28.960
starting with the call from your daughter.

33:29.520 --> 33:34.400
And I want you to tell me everything,
no matter how inconsequential, okay?

33:59.200 --> 34:00.760
How is he? What are they saying?

34:01.760 --> 34:03.080
Not enough.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.040
I'll talk to them, surgeon to surgeon.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.520
- Give me ten minutes.
- It's the fucking least you can do.

34:08.639 --> 34:10.880
- Josh.
- She told me what happened, Tom.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.400
I'm looking after your kid,
and you do this?

34:13.480 --> 34:14.639
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.040
No, fuck sorry.
Fuck your sorry!

34:18.679 --> 34:20.280
He's banging... Close your ears, please.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.520
Just close your ears.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.719
He's banging you, fine.
Whatever. Not my problem.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.040
But this? This?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.880
Hey, he's gonna be okay.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.760
You don't know that! How do you...

34:29.840 --> 34:30.800
Go find out.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.800
Go!

34:33.719 --> 34:36.639
And don't worry.
I'll look after your daughter. Again.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.000
Sorry.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.960
We made the decision
to put his body in the freezer,

34:43.040 --> 34:45.120
big chest freezer in the garage.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.760
I suppose we thought it'd keep it...

34:46.840 --> 34:47.719
fresh.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.719
It was crazy thinking,
panic thinking.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.920
And then we cleaned the swimming pool.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.560
I've watched enough cop dramas to know

34:55.639 --> 35:00.480
that there's always DNA or whatever
if you don't clean the crime scene.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.120
At the time, I thought,
"It's just as well I did that,"

35:03.200 --> 35:05.080
'cause I'm emptying the filter,

35:06.200 --> 35:07.920
and amongst all the leaves and crap,

35:08.480 --> 35:10.200
one of Sia's pendants was in there.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.520
I was like, "See. Evidence."

35:15.080 --> 35:16.360
It's always the little things.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.920
Why would Sia's pendant be
at the bottom of the pool?

35:21.200 --> 35:23.920
Well, I assume that when
she was pulling his...

35:25.520 --> 35:28.200
When she was getting Chris
out of the pool, it came off.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.760
Things don't just fall off.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.640
Well, no, not in the ordinary run
of things, but moving a body...

35:35.320 --> 35:37.560
- What?
- Unless there was a struggle.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.320
- No.
- Someone fighting for their life.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.760
No!

35:40.840 --> 35:43.000
I know my daughter.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.640
I believe her. She found the kid drowned.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.720
She had no reason to kill him.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.120
So, no. No struggle. No fight.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.760
And where's this pendant now?

35:58.720 --> 36:00.800
I put it back in her jewelry box.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.480
Stable.

36:08.560 --> 36:09.680
What is that shit?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.960
- It means he's going to be fine.
- Ah.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.080
His seizure was caused by him
not managing his illness properly,

36:19.160 --> 36:22.200
fluid he can't process,
which causes high blood pressure.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.720
Josh.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.880
I fucked up.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.560
Hmm.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.840
You havin' a nap?

37:08.440 --> 37:09.760
I'm scared for Jenny.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.920
I sent Emma because, right now...

37:14.000 --> 37:15.800
I'd do anything to find my daughter,

37:15.880 --> 37:17.600
put my arms around her,

37:18.240 --> 37:23.560
and tell her, no matter what she's
involved in, we can make it all right.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
Jenny knew you were spying on her.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.440
Josh says Henry found the app.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.960
Oh, shit.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.960
This is all such a mess.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.720
Come here.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.200
Jesus.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.800
Oh.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.280
What? It's you.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.720
Where are you taking us, Eric?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.520
I know where he's going.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.560
What the hell's he doing here?

39:11.720 --> 39:13.920
That's what we're gonna find out.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.960
May I help you?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.760
Yeah, Dr. Tom Delaney
and Dr. Peter Mayfield.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.120
We've, um, been called.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.080
Report to the center.

39:43.040 --> 39:43.880
Evening.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.360
Hi. Uh, we're doctors
accompanying Mr. Pratchett.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.920
He's just arrived.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.480
Mr. Pratchett?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.760
- Yeah, he didn't say anything about...
- Really?

39:56.320 --> 39:57.720
Can you get him back?

39:57.800 --> 40:00.160
I mean, we were following in our car.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.400
That is weird. There must be
some kind of a mix up, is there?

40:04.880 --> 40:06.120
One moment.

40:09.480 --> 40:12.080
Yeah, I've got two doctors
with Mr. Pratchett.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.680
Stop!

40:15.760 --> 40:18.000
Hello, mate. Thank God you're here.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.640
- Is this, um, Jasmine Hall?
- Move!

40:21.600 --> 40:23.400
Eric! Eric!

40:28.200 --> 40:29.240
Get on the floor!

40:29.800 --> 40:30.760
On the floor now!

40:30.840 --> 40:32.440
Final warning!

40:32.520 --> 40:34.560
Stop! Stop!

40:34.640 --> 40:36.000
He's with me.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.720
You deserve answers.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.640
I can't protect him anymore.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.000
Protect who?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.680
My son, Craig.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.760
Is this yours?

41:40.600 --> 41:42.400
No, I've never seen it before in my life.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.240
He never recovered.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.920
He never spoke again.

42:11.640 --> 42:15.560
Better than dead, yes, but no life.

42:16.440 --> 42:19.440
No real life, in places like this.

42:20.640 --> 42:24.720
Did my wife used to come here
to visit him?

42:30.680 --> 42:31.800
Why?

42:34.440 --> 42:37.520
They were friends at school.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.520
And she hated

42:41.600 --> 42:43.280
that he ended up like this.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.960
Hated what happened.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.080
What happened?

42:46.160 --> 42:49.960
Do you know why the gates and walls
in the community were built?

42:50.040 --> 42:52.240
- Because of the school fire.
- Right.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.040
Eight children died.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.160
No one felt safe anymore.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.360
People thought it was an outsider.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.040
But Craig and some friends...

43:02.960 --> 43:04.680
They were kids, understand.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.120
They were angry with a teacher

43:07.760 --> 43:10.520
for how he'd treated them.

43:11.120 --> 43:15.760
They wanted some sort of silly revenge.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.560
That's all it was meant to be.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.880
It got out of control.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.560
It was late.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.000
They didn't realize people were
in the school...

43:27.600 --> 43:28.440
other kids.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.760
Who?

43:33.920 --> 43:34.960
Who was involved?

43:36.640 --> 43:37.480
Craig.

43:39.640 --> 43:40.520
Helen.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.680
Bobby.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.120
Who else?

43:55.280 --> 43:56.120
Rachel?

43:59.480 --> 44:01.040
Maybe I deserve this.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.320
The four of them. It makes sense.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.360
No, it wasn't four.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.800
There was five of them.
Five kids.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.240
Who else?

44:19.960 --> 44:21.560
You lied to me.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.480
Sophie.
