WEBVTT

02:34.529 --> 02:36.565
Ho/a.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.275
Hey, what's wrong?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.905
My dad...

02:55.884 --> 02:56.919
Ready?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.071
We flee death,

03:24.245 --> 03:26.031
and we give ourselves to death.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.788
We flee death,
and we give ourselves to death.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.078
We flee death,

03:31.252 --> 03:33.083
and we give ourselves to death.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.408
You don't need to see this.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.448
Don't look. Don't look.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.834
We flee death,

04:16.047 --> 04:17.833
and we give ourselves to death.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.459
We flee death,

04:19.634 --> 04:21.249
and we give ourselves to death.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.269
Mom, it's been two days.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.781
Mom, it's been two days.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.814
We've been south of the
compound, we've been north.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.232
They could have gone east.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.243
Mom, we have to go
back to the Abigail.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.779
- We're never gonna find him like this.
- He's out here, I know he is.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.572
Travis might have gone back.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.742
Madison, there's
water on the boat.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.081
We can't keep scavenging.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.291
The truck's running on fumes.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.387
Okay.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.807
Miguel, how's it going?

06:38.981 --> 06:39.936
It's okay.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.896
I just can walk a little...

06:48.074 --> 06:49.280
Come in, come in.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.031
Bring it over here!

07:01.379 --> 07:03.586
Hey, boy! Come here!

07:04.006 --> 07:05.166
Me?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.080
Yeah, you.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.715
Make yourself useful.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.096
How are we doing today, Don
Oliver/o?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.258
Dr. Nuhez, please excuse my language,

07:16.269 --> 07:17.930
Dr. Nuhez, please excuse my language,

07:18.104 --> 07:20.390
but / feel like shit.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.184
I'm not a doctor.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.769
I'm a pharmacist.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.309
And my name is Alejandro.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.104
/ won 't be here much longer.
Don Alejandro.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.819
You should consider

07:31.993 --> 07:34.200
saving the meds.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.407
Not today.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.572
Maybe tomorrow.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.971
- Maybe tomorrow. Who knows.
- Yeah.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.090
Okay...

08:02.607 --> 08:05.144
Hey! Focus!

08:17.830 --> 08:18.330
- No.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.947
- No.
- Where the hell did it go?

08:22.001 --> 08:23.707
The military waited for us to land.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.119
They waited and...

08:30.218 --> 08:31.628
What now?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.759
We walk into the sea.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.516
Okay, we need shelter.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.470
That hotel up the beach.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.137
- Come on, let's go.
- If we go, he'll never find us.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.103
- He's not looking.
- He always comes home.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.143
Mom, it's me and you now
whether you like it or not.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.985
Mom, it's me and you now
whether you like it or not.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.093
Nothing's moved.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.052
The place will be picked clean.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.602
It could be crawling.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.509
Better indoors than out.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.346
The water is even dirtier
than the bandages.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.395
Come. We have to
take care of something.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.498
Someone locked this place down.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.963
Where are they now?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.322
Are you out of your mind?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.707
The service is subpar.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.955
- Where...
- Close the door!

12:45.473 --> 12:47.009
Where the hell are we going?

12:51.312 --> 12:52.893
Hello.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.027
Shit.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.199
We've got some walking to do,
so we better get things clear.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.031
One, around los muertos, you
stay absolutely quiet.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.071
Two, around me, you
stay absolutely quiet.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.367
Two, around me, you
stay absolutely quiet.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.873
Three, when we get
where we're going,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.784
we're gonna see some
real hijos de puta.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.498
Unless I tell you, you stay--

13:18.547 --> 13:21.004
Absolutely quiet. Yeah, okay.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.129
Put on your makeup. I can
smell you from here.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.928
So one thing before I
can't talk anymore.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.179
So one thing before I
can't talk anymore.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.347
Why me?

13:39.026 --> 13:41.893
Because, gringuito,

13:41.946 --> 13:43.937
nobody's gonna miss you.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.500
Who's gonna miss you?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.707
The only one who will miss
me is already missing.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.818
Happiest day of somebody's life.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.322
Until it wasn't.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.618
You know, I was
almost married once.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.375
Who was the lucky guy?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.753
His name was William.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.256
He was a good man.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.174
Couldn't have been that good.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.140
You said almost.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.682
He was moving to New Mexico.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.857
Santa Fe.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.610
And I had to take
care of my parents.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.646
The past, it'll make you sick.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.363
The past, it'll make you sick.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.400
Madison, let's find the kitchen.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.696
Madison, let's find the kitchen.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.878
Mom, let's go.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.979
So this morning, what was that?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.106
So this morning, what was that?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.321
Those near death deliver
themselves to the dead

15:58.374 --> 16:00.740
and join the wall.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.785
Our brothers, our sisters

16:03.837 --> 16:06.453
protect them.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.839
They protect us.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.835
What if you're wrong?

16:12.888 --> 16:15.300
What if your friend just
became lunch for no reason?

16:17.893 --> 16:20.726
This, the world, the dead,

16:20.771 --> 16:22.352
what do you think is happening?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.138
You who are weak
and have no faith,

16:24.191 --> 16:25.146
tell me, what do you believe?

16:25.192 --> 16:27.148
I don't know.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.731
Every so often the
ocean washes red.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.442
The coast fill with
foam and trash.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.482
The sun becomes like poison and
it burns the water and the land,

16:34.493 --> 16:37.235
The sun becomes like poison and
it burns the water and the land,

16:37.287 --> 16:38.902
washing it clean.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.450
This is no different.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.289
The dead, they're returning.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.329
And when they go, this
world will be as new.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.796
And when they go, this
world will be as new.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.543
- This the pharmacist's idea?
- It's the truth.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.090
- This the pharmacist's idea?
- It's the truth.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.346
Without him, we'd be lost.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.598
You don't look too found.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.726
You really don't get it, do you?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.189
He was bitten.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.145
Bullshit.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.604
You're bit, you turn.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.269
Not him.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.483
You really believe that?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.489
l have no need to believe.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.366
I saw.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.278
Keep walking, gringuito.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.179
We should check the rooms.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.261
All of them.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.643
You know, the guests had luggage,
the minibars might be stocked.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.098
The kitchen was empty.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.685
Go floor by floor, room by room,

17:48.734 --> 17:50.565
- we'll find something.
- Let's look down here.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.943
- You look down here.
- I want you with me.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.774
Ofelia and I will check the tower and
we'll meet back here before sunset.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.814
No, I said no.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.074
We checked every
hall, every door.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.905
If there are infected,
we would have seen them.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.696
Survivors would have come out.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.239
The place is dead.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.916
- Alicia.
- She can take care of herself.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.748
Doing it half my life.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.878
Have a seat. Drinks on me.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.388
- Not now, Victor.
- Especially now.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.674
- I'm good.
- Well, you look like shit.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.558
Oh, thank you.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.095
You're welcome.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.434
You need some color
in your cheeks.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.475
You need a drink.
I need a drink.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.521
You need a drink.
I need a drink.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.396
Come now, it's medicinal.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.658
Come now, it's medicinal.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.504
Who are these guys?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.541
They're a gang. One of many.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.667
They're a gang. One of many.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.755
They control East Tijuana.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.137
All goods, all
supplies come here.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.007
They're drug dealers.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.301
They deal with everything now.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.891
And they will hang you for
looking at them wrong.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.577
Welcome to Marco's.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.253
We need water.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.668
What? No welcome?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.301
What do you have for me?

20:02.409 --> 20:05.401
You know the drill.
Whatever fits into the cart.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.032
- The deal are two.
- Not anymore.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.707
Come.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.966
Come on, let's shop.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.567
-Mmm.
- I'll tell you right here, right now,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.159
-Mmm.
- I'll tell you right here, right now,

20:48.205 --> 20:50.116
the way to make a
perfect martini.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.622
Gin over rocks in a shaker.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.909
Come up real close to it

20:54.962 --> 20:57.499
and whisper vermouth.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.333
- Is that so?

20:59.383 --> 21:00.623
- Wait, what?
- What?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.086
- Say that again.
- Is that so?

21:02.135 --> 21:04.126
Aha, how did I not realize

21:04.137 --> 21:05.388
Aha, how did I not realize

21:05.430 --> 21:07.421
that our very own Madison Clark

21:07.432 --> 21:09.047
that our very own Madison Clark

21:09.101 --> 21:10.966
is a Southern belle.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.305
Alabama.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.640
Mm-hmm.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.521
Tended bar to put
myself through school.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.557
And I'll tell you right
here, right now,

21:18.568 --> 21:19.603
And I'll tell you right
here, right now,

21:19.653 --> 21:21.393
your story is bullshit.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.152
Your martini's bullshit.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.063
And that vermouth shtick
is as old as the hills.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.403
All right.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.659
Educate me, Ms. Clark.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.406
Bring me tequila.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.378
God, I hate hotels.
Oh, they creep me out.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.595
God, I hate hotels.
Oh, they creep me out.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.552
The dead walk the earth and
it's hotels that creep you out?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.218
I think it's the carpets.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.692
Shit, we better go back.
Come on.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.736
- Wait.
- Alicia.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.403
Wait, not yet.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.764
Somebody's marked
the infected rooms.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.275
Hey, come on.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.124
Well, minibar's down to peanuts.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.001
Guess they were allergic.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.735
Come on, let's go.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.198
Ofelia.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.309
So what are we looking for?

24:07.362 --> 24:09.353
Water, gauze, vitamins,

24:09.406 --> 24:11.818
anything we can use
in the infirmary.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.250
Stop.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.465
Only what we need.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.896
Nick.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.945
Just fill it up, okay?

24:55.994 --> 24:57.985
Should use the bottom here.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.269
Hey, there's still hot water.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.105
Why do you think he gave up?

25:35.116 --> 25:36.617
Why do you think he gave up?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.201
What?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.033
That man.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.664
I'd have tried, like,
50 diﬁerent things

25:48.713 --> 25:50.089
before I would have.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.122
Maybe he was tired.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.291
Tired of what?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.924
Surviving.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.303
You don't get tired
of surviving.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.434
You just push on.
You-- you got to.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.815
What?

26:07.857 --> 26:10.473
We're not gonna make it.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.399
Don't say that.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.362
You know, my father,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.949
he was always one
step behind hope.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.789
| see that now.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.206
Then Daniel was wrong.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.381
That's all we have.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.668
We lose that and we're dead.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.885
I'm sorry.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.561
You have me.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.067
For what it's worth, you know?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.773
We're your family now.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.982
Family is family.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.084
Hey.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.687
Leave him alone, you bastard!

27:30.857 --> 27:32.097
- Damn!
- Leave him!

27:32.275 --> 27:34.311
He want's to fuck with us!

27:39.866 --> 27:40.696
You son of a bitch!

27:44.663 --> 27:45.994
What did you do?
What did you just do?

27:46.039 --> 27:47.870
Bring me the machete.
Explain to him what will happen.

27:47.916 --> 27:48.905
Hey, I'm sorry.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.203
Do you know what will happen?

27:51.711 --> 27:52.871
We cut your hands of.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.169
- They're gonna chop off your hand.
- No, no, no, wait.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.206
Translate for me. Ask him if
that's his sister in there.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.920
- That your sister in there? Ask him.
- What's he saying?

27:59.969 --> 28:01.095
Ask him is that his sister?

28:02.097 --> 28:04.463
Is this your sister in there ?

28:06.267 --> 28:08.258
No, no, no, wait, wait.
If he doesn't let me go,

28:08.311 --> 28:09.061
we'll take our
business elsewhere.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.095
If you don 't let him go
we 'll take our business elsewhere.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.142
If you don 't let him go
we 'll take our business elsewhere.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.277
Si, si, no more Oxy.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.983
Yeah, you're gonna
run out of Oxy.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.569
- No more Oxy, man. Tell him.
- I'll give him ten seconds.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.443
Tell him that there is nothing left. Nothing left.
The pharmacy is empty. It's all gone.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.489
Tell him that there is nothing left. Nothing left.
The pharmacy is empty. It's all gone.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.372
You have your stash, but at the
rate you're going through it, man,

28:30.417 --> 28:32.874
that's gonna last, what, a few weeks?
- It will be enough for two weeks at most.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.910
Maximum. And, yeah, you can
find a substitute, sure,

28:34.921 --> 28:36.536
Maximum. And, yeah, you can
find a substitute, sure,

28:36.589 --> 28:38.580
but that crave's gonna get
worse and worse and worse

28:38.591 --> 28:40.127
but that crave's gonna get
worse and worse and worse

28:40.176 --> 28:42.167
and your sister needs her family.
- She needs it.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.714
and your sister needs her family.
- She needs it.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.924
- Familly.
- You son of a bitch!

28:45.974 --> 28:48.807
Yeah, they need it. You let your
sister go for one week without it,

28:48.852 --> 28:51.309
you're gonna pray she turns
just so you can kill her.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.265
If she doesn't get the stuff

28:53.398 --> 28:56.140
you'll have no choice but killing her.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.524
- You need Oxy.
- She needs oxy.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.064
- We have Oxy.
- We have oxy.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.445
But now, if you want it,

29:09.456 --> 29:10.912
But now, if you want it,

29:10.957 --> 29:12.948
we want another cart of water.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.124
If you want more oxy

29:19.174 --> 29:22.086
than we want another
cart of water.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.375
Another one.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.785
What?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.544
They don't know
where our coloniais

29:59.589 --> 30:01.329
and we can't let them know.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.963
They ever followed you before?

30:03.009 --> 30:05.375
No, but I never had a stupid
gringo call them out.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.259
They could have killed
us both right there.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.261
Well, we're safe,
we got the water.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.468
No, now we're not safe.
Now they're interested.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.055
It was not your place.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.640
If you want to die, go ahead.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.850
I'm sorry.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.936
Lo siento.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.486
What?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.520
It means I'm sorry.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.196
If we were sitting here
before it all went to hell,

30:34.207 --> 30:36.072
If we were sitting here
before it all went to hell,

30:36.125 --> 30:38.832
maybe both of us would have
skipped down to Rosarito.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.709
No, it wouldn't have happened.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.417
Steven and | always took
the kids to Joshua Tree.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.457
Ah, you never know.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.379
Ah, you never know.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.760
I could have come
down to see Tom,

30:49.806 --> 30:51.797
you would have been on some
god-awful family getaway.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.548
you would have been on some
god-awful family getaway.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.592
You would have snuck away
from your motherly duties,

30:55.603 --> 30:57.434
You would have snuck away
from your motherly duties,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.392
snuck down to the
bar and found me.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.353
I would have sat next to you.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.359
We would have talked.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.489
Sure, I'd talk to you.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.525
I would have talked about
coming up in the world,

31:11.536 --> 31:12.571
I would have talked about
coming up in the world,

31:12.620 --> 31:14.611
some nonsense

31:14.622 --> 31:16.453
some nonsense

31:16.499 --> 31:18.410
to impress you.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.916
Anything but Tom.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.788
You would have hit on me?

31:28.219 --> 31:30.551
I'm a seducer of
people, Madison.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.013
It would have been fun.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.726
But now there's
no coming, no up,

31:45.737 --> 31:47.193
But now there's
no coming, no up,

31:47.238 --> 31:49.229
and no world to talk about.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.276
and no world to talk about.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.030
No Tom.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.037
No Steven.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.824
There's not even a goddamn bar.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.085
She's right.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.128
Alicia's right.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.425
I'm never gonna see Nick again.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.272
He's alive.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.932
The boy is bulletproof.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.600
Yeah, you don't get it.

32:30.531 --> 32:33.364
That boy was born lost.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.745
Like his daddy.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.078
He's been slipping
through my fingers

32:40.124 --> 32:42.706
ever since the day I
gave birth to him.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.913
Maybe you've been
holding on too tight.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.954
- Obviously not.
- Okay. All right.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.250
- Obviously not.
- Okay. All right.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.875
It's his father's darkness.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.842
You leave them alone,

32:56.891 --> 32:58.973
they head straight
towards death.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.107
How did Steven pass?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.652
Came home from the work site.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.948
Came home from the work site.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.829
It was late.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.243
Crossed the divider...

33:27.630 --> 33:29.586
into oncoming traffic.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.260
He fell asleep?

33:41.269 --> 33:43.510
That's what I told the kids.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.899
You were trying to protect them.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.032
I keep trying to save them.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.903
They keep dying.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.624
Over and over.

34:10.256 --> 34:13.214
Travis stopped that for
a while, you know?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.137
These things...

34:22.268 --> 34:24.975
we can only live with them.
We can't choose.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.012
We can choose.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.183
We can choose.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.564
Yeah, absolutely choose.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.976
I didn't have to have Nick.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.270
You know, I could
have not had Alicia,

34:35.323 --> 34:37.860
but I wanted to be a mother.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.900
I chose despite the
past and I chose wrong.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.152
I chose despite the
past and I chose wrong.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.868
Hey, that's the drink talking.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.283
No, no, no. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm good.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.247
Whool I'm good, I
have a hollow leg.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.173
Cheers. Come on.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.049
- Cheers. To motherhood.
- Okay, to motherhood.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.755
All right.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.897
- To false hope.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.237
To false hope.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.286
All right.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.700
Ah.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.638
Ofelia? Your turn.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.015
Ofelia?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.621
Mom!

37:35.670 --> 37:37.752
Mom!

37:42.426 --> 37:43.802
Ofelia?

37:46.973 --> 37:49.385
Ofelia!

37:49.433 --> 37:51.469
Where the hell are you?

38:12.665 --> 38:14.701
Alejandro will find you.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.591
Hola.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.635
Here. I got you something.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.511
Here. I got you something.

38:37.565 --> 38:40.227
It's a little bit smushed,
but it should be all right.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.312
Take it. It's yours.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.063
Okay. Well, it's
here if you want it.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.189
Okay. Well, it's
here if you want it.

39:03.049 --> 39:03.959
/ am sorry.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.844
Nick.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.702
I hear you almost started
a war over a Gansito.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.793
I hear you almost started
a war over a Gansito.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.876
That girl's father died today.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.127
That girl's father died today.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.920
/ just thought she
might need something.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.349
And what did you
think she needed?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.383
Something. Anything. Comfort.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.474
Something. Anything. Comfort.

39:59.605 --> 40:02.017
If it's comfort you want to offer,
you're going to need more cake.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.148
Not everything can
be about death.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.685
You're exactly wrong.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.834
This morning, you saw
me inject that man.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.250
Saline solution.

40:31.303 --> 40:34.215
It will do nothing to protect
him from the infection.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.756
- He will soon die.
- So why inject him?

40:36.809 --> 40:38.970
Like you, I would prefer
that he not fear.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.933
And yet we are running
out of medicine.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.973
Nicholas, when we run out of cake
and drugs, where will we turn?

40:44.984 --> 40:46.520
Nicholas, when we run out of cake
and drugs, where will we turn?

40:46.569 --> 40:49.060
Comfort is no
supplement for faith.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.853
You do that girl no favors.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.897
So you're just gonna wait?

40:52.908 --> 40:54.739
So you're just gonna wait?

40:54.785 --> 40:56.946
What good is faith when
the water runs out?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.739
This is a test.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.499
The dead are walking toward
their final resting place.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.786
And when they leave,

41:06.839 --> 41:09.330
when the world is
washed clean of death,

41:09.383 --> 41:11.624
we the faithful will remain.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.884
We have been chosen.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.510
We will outlast death.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.638
How do you know?

41:17.683 --> 41:19.514
Why are you so sure?

41:33.782 --> 41:35.443
Dnnk

41:38.287 --> 41:40.994
You're welcome to stay with us.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.031
But if you ever put my
people in danger again,

41:43.042 --> 41:44.202
But if you ever put my
people in danger again,

41:44.251 --> 41:46.367
I will feed you to the wall.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.513
To family.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.341
To family.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.428
- Whool

42:08.108 --> 42:09.848
To Nick.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.477
All right.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.071
Madison.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.162
Madison.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.373
We need to go now.

42:26.418 --> 42:27.794
Okay.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.255
We flee death,

42:41.433 --> 42:43.048
and we give ourselves to death.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.137
Yes, Lord.

42:44.311 --> 42:47.018
They say the Lord created the world

42:47.189 --> 42:49.271
and that we owe Him our lives.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.231
But that's not true.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.351
Life is a breath between to deaths.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.477
Life is a breath between to deaths.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.646
And this is where life ends.

42:56.657 --> 42:57.897
And this is where life ends.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.950
Our parents, brothers,
friends and neighbors...

43:08.961 --> 43:10.792
Our parents, brothers,
friends and neighbors...

43:10.963 --> 43:12.954
- They leave.
- Their time has come.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.713
The great pilgrimage of souls,

43:14.883 --> 43:17.545
the great migration
of the dead has begun.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.765
- But what about us?
- Not us.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.351
They thought we were dead already.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.558
We know the dead. He won 't take us.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.025
We know the dead. He won 't take us.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.696
We won 't follow him.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.150
This world belongs to us,

43:39.325 --> 43:41.316
the believers,
the chosen ones, the bereaved.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.113
the believers,
the chosen ones, the bereaved.

43:43.329 --> 43:46.036
We already died
and we're not afraid anymore.

43:46.248 --> 43:48.534
We are the children of resurrection.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.745
We flee death,

43:50.919 --> 43:52.455
and we give ourselves to death.

44:19.531 --> 44:20.441
But never...

44:21.450 --> 44:22.940
...will we go away.
