03:51.100 --> 03:53.600
Why in the worldwould I want to go with you?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.840
Because I don't wantto go by myself.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.590
Saul,you know I wouldn'tdo this if I had a choice,

03:58.590 --> 03:59.900
but if I don't talk to them,

03:59.900 --> 04:02.350
then holly will,and you and I both knowthat if she does,

04:02.350 --> 04:06.460

Oh,right,and never getanother wink of sleepwaiting for hollyto spread her venom?

04:26.020 --> 04:28.290
This was not an idle bluff.

04:28.370 --> 04:33.690
I just don't want this familyto suffer the consequencesof any more of william'smoral lapses.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.780
Well,why don't you just askone of the kids to go with you?

04:36.780 --> 04:38.460
Are you kidding me?

04:38.460 --> 04:41.710
If they find outwhat I'm doing,they'll be all overthat poor family.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.610
I'll have anotheritalian opera on my hands.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.110
Saul,come on,please.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.450
I-I thoughtI could count on you.

04:48.450 --> 04:53.090
You can count on me,just not for this.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.000
Are you on your way out?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.100
In a minute,to do some errands.

05:07.330 --> 05:10.060
Uh,swag from a children'sliteracy conference.

"Senator mccallistercan't be with us today.

05:13.430 --> 05:17.070
"So in his place,I'd like you to welcomehis lovely wife kitty.

05:17.070 --> 05:21.040
"And then I smile at seaof disappointed faces.

05:22.350 --> 05:23.710
William would do that.

05:23.710 --> 05:26.810
He would agree to attendsome event,and then--

05:26.810 --> 05:28.790
and then he'd get called awayat the last minute,

05:28.790 --> 05:32.270
and I would have to goin his place all by myself.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.230
I hated it.

05:34.230 --> 05:41.050
Now I realize he wasprobably off diddling hollyor connie laffertyor god knows who.

05:41.050 --> 05:44.380
At--at leastrobert is awaytalking to world leaders.

05:44.380 --> 05:46.530
It's not quite the same.

05:46.530 --> 05:47.240
-No.
-Plus,look at this.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.340
I got a goody bag out of it.

05:49.340 --> 05:51.550

06:02.720 --> 06:03.800
Do you know if she has it?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.540
Yeah,she has it,and so does paigeand so does cooper.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.460
It's the standardgrandmother gift.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.610
Well,is there any reasonyou're not keeping itfor your own baby?

06:11.610 --> 06:14.650
It would feel likewe were tempting fate.

06:14.650 --> 06:17.540
I mean,we haven't even beenchosen by a birth mother yet,and I...

06:17.540 --> 06:20.390
I don't want to--I don't want to jinx anything.

06:20.390 --> 06:23.610
Well,then why don't youlet me keep it for youuntil you're ready?

06:23.610 --> 06:25.140

06:46.690 --> 06:48.350

06:48.350 --> 06:51.900
You know,I'm very goodat solving problems head-on.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.320
But I'm not goodat waiting around.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.790
You know...

07:01.790 --> 07:07.130

07:27.700 --> 07:29.100

Holly threatened me.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.320
We're running awayfrom holly?

07:57.320 --> 08:01.390

08:01.390 --> 08:03.310
-I have to talk to them before--
-we're going to bakersfield?

08:03.310 --> 08:04.320
Why didn't you tell me?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.430
Because I was put inan untenable position and I--

08:06.430 --> 08:08.280

10:11.340 --> 10:13.490
Just catching upon robert's voting record.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.910
You know,trying to get up to speedbefore I start the new job.

10:15.910 --> 10:16.850
Cool.

10:16.850 --> 10:21.420
Well,um,I was hopingthat maybe you'd come with meto justin's N.A.Meeting.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.950
He's gettinghis 1-year chip today.

10:22.950 --> 10:23.690
It's been a year?

10:23.690 --> 10:26.810
Yeah,and,you know,he doesn't wantto make a big deal out of it,but I do.

10:26.810 --> 10:30.010
And seeing as he creditsyou and tommyfor getting him throughthe detox,

10:30.010 --> 10:34.010
I was thinkingit would be nice if,well,for justin,if--

10:34.010 --> 10:36.130
if youwould be there to support him,

10:36.130 --> 10:40.200
maybe set aside your own issuesto celebrate and,uh--

10:40.200 --> 10:43.140
I'm sorry.Why the hard sell?What'S...

10:43.470 --> 10:45.220
oh,you're inviting tommy.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.230
Come on.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.660
Justin misses hangingout with you two together.

10:48.660 --> 10:51.100
I mean,it would be an amazinggift if you guys both went.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.350
Can't we just buy him a watch?

10:52.350 --> 10:53.120
Kevin.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.320
Look,I'm really sorry.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.010
There's just a lot of murky,polluted waterunder the fraternal bridgeright now.

10:59.010 --> 11:02.710
Listen,I knowit's a lot to ask,but if you could just set asideyour differenc for one hour.

11:02.710 --> 11:06.310
One hour--that's it.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.080
come on.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.540
I know you'rea bigger man than this.

11:08.540 --> 11:11.550
I'm actually not.I'm very small and petty.

11:13.470 --> 11:18.020
Okay,I'll be therewith the man who fed me,betrayed me,kicked me outof the family business.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.020
I'll do that for justin.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.100
Thank you,thank you,thank you.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.560
If kevin behaves,I'll behave.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.620
All right.I'll see you then.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.980
Okay.Od-bye,rebecca.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.430
How do I look?

11:31.430 --> 11:32.190
Fine.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.020
Great.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.180
You said "fine.

11:34.180 --> 11:36.010
"I know better than to havethis conversation with you.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.290
Why do you carewhat I think anyway?

11:37.290 --> 11:38.640
I've gotthis big job interview.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.640
I want to look young and hip.

11:40.640 --> 11:44.160
You know,casualwithout being apathetic,professional,not corporate.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.410
This sounds like a de.

11:45.410 --> 11:48.770
I'd be much less nervousif it was a date.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.400
It's a job.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.480
It's such a great job.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.220
It's C.F.O.Of a small internet company.

11:54.220 --> 11:57.070
They specialize in organicand local produce.

11:57.070 --> 12:00.550
It's a start-up,flexible hoursand they're comfortablewith a telecommute,

12:00.550 --> 12:02.350
so I can work from home.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.670
It's so perfect that...

12:03.670 --> 12:04.540
I'm not gonna get it.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.640
A start-upis your perfect job?

12:06.640 --> 12:07.940
Well,it's not reallya start-up.

12:07.940 --> 12:11.410
You know,from what I gather,it's more of an already-started.

12:11.410 --> 12:13.580
Good salarycommensurate with experience.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.660
Stock options,which is great,'cause apparentlyin this job market,

12:16.660 --> 12:19.260
I'm only worth half as muchas I used to be.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.810
I mean,you,food--it's a slam dunk.

12:21.810 --> 12:22.810
Right.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.140
But the internet thing...

12:24.140 --> 12:26.160
these guys are apparently,like,wunderkinds.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.970
I'm afraid they're gonna takeone look at meand see a person

12:27.970 --> 12:29.380
-who'sold enough to be their--
-mother.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.900
I was gonna say big sister.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.490
Wow,I fell into that one.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.800
Sarah,it's your firstjob interview since school,and you're nervous.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.910
It's fine.

12:36.910 --> 12:38.380
Yeah,well,I should be.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.300
I'm a mother of twowith a mortgageand alimony payments.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.260
I've gotta nailthis interview,tommy.

12:43.260 --> 12:44.850
Sarah,you will.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.610
Relax.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.600
They'dbe foolish not to hire you.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.250
-You think?
-Yeah,sure.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.930
You,uh,screwed your coworker,uh,you almost tankeddad's company,

12:53.930 --> 12:56.560
and you quitwithout any notice.

12:58.450 --> 13:00.490
the current weather condition in bakersfield...

13:00.490 --> 13:01.220
hi,honey.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.210
I guess you'rereally tied up in meetings.

13:03.210 --> 13:07.370
But,um,mom and iare on our way to bakersfield.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.200

13:12.980 --> 13:14.350
They'retalking about you on the radio.

13:14.350 --> 13:18.670
Mccallister of california is expected to spend five days touring the middle east...

13:18.670 --> 13:19.780

13:19.780 --> 13:21.180
Middle east?

13:21.180 --> 13:23.060
-Wait a minute.
-Iraq and turkey.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.400
In a press conference...

13:24.400 --> 13:25.080
oh,no.No,no,no.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.600
Robert,robert,are--are you--are you crazy?

13:27.600 --> 13:31.110
Now why on earth would you goto the most dangerous placeon this planet and not tell me?

13:31.110 --> 13:32.830
And why did I have tohear about it on the radio?

13:32.830 --> 13:35.900
And--and call me.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.230
He lied to youabout where he's going.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.770
that is the house.

13:47.770 --> 13:50.250
Well,it--it's pretty.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.430

14:01.650 --> 14:03.370
I feel sick to my stomach.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.020
I think I'm gonna cry.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.390
You ring the bell.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.060

We're refueling in cypress.

14:26.110 --> 14:27.010

14:27.010 --> 14:28.960
I-I wanted to let you knowbefore the press broke it,

14:28.960 --> 14:32.130
but the state departmentinsisted we keep it classifieduntil we were on the ground.

14:32.130 --> 14:34.980
Okay,but I seriously doubtthe state department...

14:34.980 --> 14:36.860
thought thatI would notify hamas.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.180
Look,you need to see thisfor what it is--

14:38.180 --> 14:40.430
an opportunity to influencepolicy on a world stage.

14:40.430 --> 14:42.840
Robert this about yourunning again in 2012.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.030
I don't want to havethis argument now.

14:44.030 --> 14:44.850
I'm not arguing.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.120
-I'm just stating a fact.
-excuse me,senator.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.230

All right.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.080
I love you,too.

14:54.590 --> 14:55.710
not home.

14:55.710 --> 14:58.040
Oh,so--so what now?

14:58.040 --> 14:59.780
We wait.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.580
Hi.I'm sarah walker.

15:02.580 --> 15:03.560
I hope I'm not late.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.750
No,no,not at all.We're early.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.700
-Hi,kyle dewitt.This is my partner.
-Kyle,hi.

15:06.700 --> 15:07.870
Ethan,right?

15:07.870 --> 15:08.670
Yep.

15:08.670 --> 15:09.850
Hey,how are you?

15:09.850 --> 15:11.110
Nice to meet you.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.380
So I'm so sorrythat we're doing this here.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.740
It's just that our officesare--are being renovated.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.240
There's no need to apologize.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.190
This--this is great.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.860
So what do you knowabout,uh,greenatopia?

15:20.860 --> 15:21.840
Not very much.Just what the recruitertold me.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.030
So please tell me more.

15:25.030 --> 15:26.810
Okay,good.We'll startat the beginning then.

15:26.810 --> 15:29.680
This company was bornunder one basic assumption--

15:29.680 --> 15:31.460
people want to do moreto help the environment,

15:31.460 --> 15:33.770
they just don't have accessto enough information.

15:33.770 --> 15:34.590
They're confused.

15:34.590 --> 15:35.440
And who can blame 'em?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.760
You know,any globally conscious consumeris immediately confronted

15:37.760 --> 15:40.190
with all these decisionsthe secondthey walk into a supermarket.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.930
Do they buy organic producefrom overseas,

15:41.930 --> 15:43.810
or do they buycoentionalthat's locally grown?

15:43.810 --> 15:45.600
You know,do you contributeto groundwater pollution,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.390
ingest pesticides intoyour system,

15:47.390 --> 15:50.980
or do youexpand your carbon footprintand increase global warming?

15:50.980 --> 15:56.140
Because of the dieselthat it takes to getyour australian organic mangoto your plate.

15:56.140 --> 15:57.350
You're right.

15:57.350 --> 16:00.360
Save your body,or save the planet--that's a toughconsumer choice.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.780
Exactly.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.790
So a couple of years ago,I'm out surfing.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.390
Oddly enough,I get my bestideas when I'm out in the ocean.

16:06.390 --> 16:07.140
GhT.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.760
And,uh,it's in between sets,I'm waiting on this wave,and this idea comes to me--

16:09.760 --> 16:12.550
what if there was a web sitewhere people could log onand find out

16:12.550 --> 16:15.230
what kind of impactthe food they buyhas on the environment?

16:15.230 --> 16:17.020
And that's the originof greenatopia.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.010
Just log on,enter your zip code and boom--

16:19.010 --> 16:23.930
our robust and efficientdatabase retrieval enginegives you all the pertinentinformation you need.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.040
It's,uh,well,it's genius.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.660
It is the internet its best,you know?

16:28.660 --> 16:32.400
It's--it's the democratizationof information.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.340
RighT.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.220
And while we helpmom-and-pop americamake nutritious,

16:35.220 --> 16:38.820
planet-friendly choices,we rake in serious coin.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.960
well,okay,what my partnermeans to say,uh,

16:41.960 --> 16:46.580
is that we haveidentified a marketand created a meansto target that market.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.550
With revenue streams fromboth consumers and vendors.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.840
You do have the chanceto make some serious coin.

16:54.530 --> 16:57.650
vendors are lining upright now,and the web site'sin beta testing.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.300
We're ready to launchthe pilot program.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.920
Th sounds great.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.870
Can I start you threewith a drink?

17:02.870 --> 17:04.970
Uh,sparking waterfor me,please.

17:04.970 --> 17:06.099
Beer.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.540
Yeah,I'll have a beer.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.430
Got it.

17:08.430 --> 17:10.150
Oh,uh,make that three beers.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.400
Sure.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.550
Welcome,everybody,to the,uh,T.G.I.F.Afternoon meeting.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.560
I'm paula,and I'm an addict.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.420
hi,paula.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.380
Hey,everybody.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.950
I'm glad you guys are here.

17:24.579 --> 17:25.990
Good.I thought was late.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.030
You are.

17:27.030 --> 17:28.710
I heard about the new job.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.920
That's awesome.Congrats.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.440
Thanks.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.400
look,can we just burythe hatchet now,please?

17:36.400 --> 17:39.070
I think you're the onethat did the hatchet job.

17:39.070 --> 17:42.340
Maybe me firing youwasn't the worst thingthat ever happened.

17:42.340 --> 17:45.350
I mean,if you--if you thinkabout it,you have a new career.

17:45.350 --> 17:48.440
I'm sorry.You want to thank you for firing me?

17:48.440 --> 17:50.040
You have a personality disorder.You know that?

17:50.040 --> 17:52.650
Oh,stop beingsuch a drama queen.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.790
Can you get out of the wayso i can be with the brotherI actually like?

17:54.790 --> 17:55.540
I'm not in your way.Go.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.620
Just move.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.420
After you.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.430
Don't be a doofus.Just move.

17:58.430 --> 18:01.290
-Hey,don't touch me.
-Don't do that.

18:06.390 --> 18:09.190
now have you guys thoughtabout franchising this?

18:09.190 --> 18:11.750
Because there is no reasonthat this shouldn't go global.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.510
Your mouth,god's ears.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.840
I mean,really.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.240
And you could be inon the ground floor on this.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.900
Well,that would be exciting.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.290
It's really exciting.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.940
One last question.

18:20.940 --> 18:26.870
Uh,if you could have dinnerwith any president...Alive or dead,who would it be?

18:26.870 --> 18:29.010
F.D.R.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.890
Interesting.

18:32.860 --> 18:38.720
Sarah,listen,your experience,your education,your personality,it's all--it's all very impressive.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.960
Thank you.

18:39.960 --> 18:45.280
And can I just sayright here,that I would very much liketo be part of your organization.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.910
I thinkwe'd love that,too.

18:46.910 --> 18:50.770
But we haveother candidates to meetbefore we make a decision.

18:50.770 --> 18:53.130
Uh,oh,right,of course.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.000
Well,thank you so much.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.540
But d-do let us know if you,uh,if you get any other offers.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.200
I will.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.440
-Thank youfor coming to lunch.
-Great to meetyou guys.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.760
You know the thingthat bugs me the mostis that

19:04.760 --> 19:09.310
he couldn't taketwo seconds to call meand tell me that he washalfway around the world.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.880
Yeah.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.280
That does sound fishy.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.080
What do you mean?

19:16.830 --> 19:18.070
Well,I don't know.

19:18.070 --> 19:20.700
Maybe he's hidingsomething else.

19:20.700 --> 19:24.610
N-n--this is aboutnational security,not--not nooky.

19:24.610 --> 19:25.740
For some men,it's sex.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.210
For others,it's power.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.140
Two sidesof the same coin,kitty.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.960
okay,mother,whatever you're trying to say,why don't youjust come out and say it?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.820
Sweetheart,I've watched you all daytying yourself upin knots about robert-

19:35.820 --> 19:37.170
-where is he?What is he doing?

19:37.170 --> 19:38.570
Oh,that is not true.

19:38.570 --> 19:41.480
I-I worry about you,that you're headed downthis dangerous path.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.470
He's obviously prioritizingcareer over family.

19:44.470 --> 19:46.110
Now he's lying to you.

19:46.110 --> 19:49.410
Um,you're getting very closeto crossing a line here.

19:49.410 --> 19:54.470
Kitty,I watchtemo que te lleveI'm afraid he's turning youagainst your family.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.950
I'm gonna go get some air.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.090
Kitty.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.480
Look,I'm sorry.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.160
I'm sor--please get back in the car.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.030
No,no,f-first of all,robert has not turned meagainst the family,mother--

20:09.030 --> 20:11.690
you were certainly quickto abandon meon the porch just now.

20:11.690 --> 20:13.170
I took a phone call.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.890
What about that nightat your house

20:14.890 --> 20:17.920
when robertrbally attacked meand the rest of our family?

20:17.920 --> 20:19.700
You never cameto anyone's defense.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.120
Oh,so now we get down to it.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.630
This is all aboutthat stupid fightthat you had with robert,isn't it?

20:23.630 --> 20:24.490
It wasn't a fight.

20:24.490 --> 20:28.140
It was a dressing downin the most arrogant,aloof sort of way.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.740
I'm not gonna stand here,mother,and let youcriticize my husband.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.580
And by the way,that is your perception.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.010
That is not how I see it.

20:34.010 --> 20:39.030
Kitty,with robert,family will always runa very distant second placeto his ambition.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.150
You are sucha piece of work,mother.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.770
-Why--why are you suddenly--
-I care about you.

20:42.770 --> 20:43.570
You're my daughter.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.410
I know what it's like to bemarried to a powerful man.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.180
You don't know what it's liketo be married to robert.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.020
You don't know anythingabout my relationship.

20:50.020 --> 20:55.370
I am not you,and robert is definitely,definitely not dad.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.250
Stop,stop.it's okay.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.910
It's okay.

21:00.610 --> 21:03.780
I'm sorry.He's,uh,he's usually very friendly.

21:04.550 --> 21:06.760
I thinkthe shouting scared him.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.490
Oh,righT.

21:07.490 --> 21:08.830
It was justa little misunderstanding.

21:08.830 --> 21:09.940
Oh,I'm--I'm--I'm sorry.No,it--it was my fault.

21:09.940 --> 21:10.890
She's my mother.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.860
Yeah,we're--we're just herewaiting for the laffertys.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.480
I'm,uh,I'm george lafferty.

21:21.890 --> 21:24.250
Hi,mr.Lafferty.

21:24.690 --> 21:25.790
I'm sorry.

21:25.790 --> 21:27.980
Uh,wh-who are you?

21:29.520 --> 21:31.370
Youin the house?

21:31.370 --> 21:34.420
Um,my son ryan'sback in school.

21:34.420 --> 21:37.050
Uh,peter and richardlive in the bay area.

21:37.050 --> 21:44.000
So nowtell me this long storyabout how you knew conniethat brought youall the way from pasadena.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.750
Uh,george,I havea confession to make.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.200
I wasn'tentirely honest before.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.470
I didn'tpersonally know your wife,but my husband did.

21:55.470 --> 21:56.750
He died a few years ago.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.840
-Uh,two.
-Two years ago,and he and...

21:59.840 --> 22:02.570
conniedid some work together.

22:02.570 --> 22:04.840
William walker...

22:04.840 --> 22:07.200
ojai foods?

22:07.200 --> 22:11.300
Oh,I-I wish I didn'thave to tell you--I don't know how to begin.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.810
My husband and your wife,we think,had an affair.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.900
You think...

22:23.490 --> 22:25.810
based on what?

22:25.810 --> 22:28.190
Well,we've pieced togetherinformation.

22:28.190 --> 22:29.410
My...

22:29.410 --> 22:31.800
my husband did thissort of thing more than once.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.990
That's not my problem.

22:32.990 --> 22:34.090
That's your problem.

22:34.090 --> 22:37.900
Look,we know how difficultthis is to hear,and--and--and it's even more-

22:37.900 --> 22:38.770
-no,I'm sorry.

22:38.770 --> 22:45.250
You cannot come into my homeand say these disgraceful thingsabout a woman who's not aroundto defend herself.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.170
Did you ever even meet her?

22:48.170 --> 22:50.980
Do you know anything aboutwhat kind of marriage we had?

22:50.980 --> 22:52.360
Let me tell you something.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.500
It's been hell on my familysince connie died.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.680
It almost destroyedmy children,and now when-

22:57.680 --> 23:00.530
when we're just findingsome fragile bit of normalcy,

23:00.530 --> 23:03.150
you--you come in herewith this...

23:03.600 --> 23:05.670
horrible story.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.250
NoW...

23:07.250 --> 23:10.520
if you could pleasejust go.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
Uh,yes,yes,mom.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.060
George,I know you're upset.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.500
If you would pleasejust hear me out.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.860
-Mom,mom,come on.
-George,please.

23:15.860 --> 23:20.150
Don't ever contact meor my family again.

23:31.590 --> 23:33.190
I thought it wasa good interview.

23:33.190 --> 23:37.650
Well,to be honest,I thought they wouldoffer me the jobright then and there.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.990
Okay,well,let me knowwhen they decide.

23:40.990 --> 23:42.450
Thanks for calling.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.070
you think there aretoo many cormorants?

23:47.790 --> 23:51.000
You can't havetoo many cormorants.

23:51.540 --> 23:53.060
So did you get the job?

23:53.060 --> 23:55.720
Uh,I'm on a short list.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.120
Is that good?

23:57.120 --> 24:00.050
Well,it's better thannot being on a list,I guess,

24:00.050 --> 24:02.240
but there's a lot of peoplelooking for work right now.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.950
But you're the smartest.

24:04.950 --> 24:07.290
You are the sweetest.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.060
So what goes in next,these little guys?

24:10.060 --> 24:11.470
Yeah.

24:11.470 --> 24:15.290
I'm gonna doan extra-credit report on themso I can be sureto get an a-plus.

24:17.080 --> 24:22.050
Maybe there's extra credityou could do,you know,to get the job.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.140
That is a good idea.

24:25.140 --> 24:28.140
Paige,that isa really good idea.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.360
Okay,so anybody else haveanything to share today?

24:31.360 --> 24:32.120

Um,god,I mean,I--you know,I remember steing moneyfrom people I loved.

25:05.030 --> 25:09.000

25:13.090 --> 25:17.150

Otherwise,we're screwed.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.940
Sarah,hey.

26:16.940 --> 26:17.650
What,uh,what are youdoing here?

Man,beer in the showeris the best.

26:28.190 --> 26:29.600
Sarah...

26:29.600 --> 26:30.700
okay,what is this?

26:30.700 --> 26:32.080
Is this,like,a scam?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.180
No,it's not a scam.

26:33.180 --> 26:34.410
All right?I know this doesn'tlook like much-

26:34.410 --> 26:37.400
-well,you're right about that.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.900
So the renovations,that was just a lie?

26:39.900 --> 26:40.900
No,I can explainthe renovation.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.400
Salary commensuratewith experience?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.290
Okay,we're assuming eventually,that once we're ina financial situationwher that's possible--

26:45.290 --> 26:47.890
-benefits package
-when vendors are lined up,you're gonna have benefits.

26:47.890 --> 26:49.190
How about the beta testing?

26:49.190 --> 26:49.930
That's true.

26:49.930 --> 26:51.760
Oh,good.Small kernel of truth.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.030
Sarah,we were honestwith you.

26:53.030 --> 26:53.710
What?

26:53.710 --> 26:54.920
We were mostly honestwith you.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.430
-Are you serious?
-It's a new company,all right?

26:56.430 --> 26:57.840
I said that it wasa new company.It's a start-up.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.510
The headhunter,the--the lunch at etage--a empresa nueva.

26:59.510 --> 27:00.510
You've done nothing but lie...

27:00.510 --> 27:02.920
-no,sarah--
-since I first heard the wordgreenatopia.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.220
God,I am such a fool.

27:04.220 --> 27:09.790
I spent the afternoonworking up this proposalto impress you guys.

27:10.130 --> 27:10.930

27:18.830 --> 27:21.060

27:21.060 --> 27:22.970
I...

27:26.460 --> 27:30.000
mom,y--you triedto do the right thing.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.300
It was impossible.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.850
And--and telling himabout ryanwould've made itso much worse.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.510
You gotta stopbeating yourself up.

27:36.510 --> 27:37.310
Pull over.

27:37.310 --> 27:38.170
What?Now?

27:38.170 --> 27:39.260
Pull over.Stop the car.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.410
Okay,are--are you sick?

27:40.410 --> 27:42.110
Pull over now.

27:42.110 --> 27:44.250
What's wrong?Wait,wait,mom!

27:47.560 --> 27:49.070
Mom,are you okay?

27:49.070 --> 27:51.630
Mother,what are you doing?

27:55.260 --> 27:57.670
I hate you,william walker!

27:57.670 --> 28:00.190
You're a selfishson of a bitch!

28:00.190 --> 28:02.170
-Oh,mom,mom,stop.
-Don't stop me.

28:02.170 --> 28:07.730
You never loved anyonebut yourselfand your stupid penis!

28:10.280 --> 28:11.890
That one really took itout of me.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.130
Yeah,yeah.

28:13.130 --> 28:15.690
That--that--that--that was a-a good one.

28:16.630 --> 28:18.230
so do you feela-a little bit better?

28:18.560 --> 28:20.740
Oh,george was right.

28:21.770 --> 28:23.560
I barely understoodmy own marriage.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.690
How could I possiblyunderstand anyone else's?

28:27.360 --> 28:28.340
Kitty,I'm so sorry.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.910
I should never have saidthose thingsabout you and robert.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.080
Ah,you weren't that farfrom the truth.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.930
Well,the truth is overrated.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.970
The truth just brokegeorge lafferty's heart.

28:36.970 --> 28:40.010
The truth broke my heart.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.200
I'm swearing off of it.

28:41.200 --> 28:41.960
Oh,come on,mom.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.910
You didn't tell anythingthat I don't already know.

28:44.910 --> 28:46.040
I mean...

28:46.040 --> 28:47.810
robert's ambition?

28:47.810 --> 28:50.910
I mean,that's been a thingbetween us since the election,

28:50.910 --> 28:54.070
and--and I know that he wantsto run for president again,

28:54.070 --> 28:57.220
and he knows that I don't wantto slog throughanother national campaign,

28:57.220 --> 29:02.380
I mean,especially if...if we ever have kids and...

29:02.380 --> 29:06.290
you know,the truththat breaks my heartis

29:06.290 --> 29:09.760
I'm afraid if he everhad to choose,he...

29:10.540 --> 29:12.970
he wouldn't choose me.

29:12.970 --> 29:14.660
Oh,kitty.

29:14.660 --> 29:17.420
Regardless of anything I said,robert loves you.

29:17.420 --> 29:18.810
I never doubted that.

29:18.810 --> 29:21.990
