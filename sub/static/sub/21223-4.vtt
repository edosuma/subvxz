WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:06.650
As a gypsy, I enjoyed nothing more than
tracking hedgehogs. But that was to eat.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.190
If people found out that we
kept him locked in an attic,

00:09.240 --> 00:10.550
they'd think we were all insane.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.430
- Which we're not.
- I'm sorry, Pippa,

00:12.480 --> 00:14.990
but you knew I was a psychopath
when you agreed to marry me.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.240
We're not absolute shite.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:39.520 --> 00:41.790
- That's deep enough, Edward.
- Oh, thank goodness.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.390
The old sciatic is playing up.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.510
- Just get the box.
- Righto.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.430
Just wondering, you will
still be backing my musical

00:48.480 --> 00:52.070
about the Queen's worst ever year? Anus.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.230
You do know "Annus" is
spelled with two Ns?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.630
Is it? Well, I've had them printed now.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.670
Right. Put this in a box.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.990
- What is it?
- A new Magna Carta.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.430
Just bury it.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.910
If you ever mention this to
a living soul, I'll bury you.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.480
In several different locations.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.470
Why didn't we go to a
restaurant for lunch?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.110
Oh, restaurants are so expensive.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.710
And all that really matters is
I'm spending time with my sister.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.990
- You just can't enjoy yourself, can you?
- Actually, I can.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.510
Wills and I are about to enjoy a
luxurious spa weekend in Poundbury.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.790
Prince Charles' sustainable toy town?

01:28.840 --> 01:30.230
Yeah, do you want to come?

01:30.280 --> 01:31.990
I'd rather shit a porcupine.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.590
Everyone knows Poundbury's a joke.

01:33.640 --> 01:37.550
- Why don't you go somewhere fun?
- Oh, as long as Wills and I are
together, I don't care where we are.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.030
You think your relationship's
better than mine, don't you?

01:40.080 --> 01:41.790
- Just cos you married a prince.
- No, I...

01:41.840 --> 01:44.950
Well, Johnny's got billions.
Not millions, billions.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.710
- Did somebody order
lunch? - Johnny! - Pippa...

01:47.760 --> 01:49.750
Why are you dressed as
a pizza delivery man?

01:49.800 --> 01:52.390
Didn't you get my text? I went
long on the building sector.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.950
I've lost everything. I'm ruined.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.030
Ruined?

01:56.080 --> 01:57.830
Anyway, that's £12 70.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.750
- I'll get it.
- Shut up!

01:59.800 --> 02:01.310
Come on, we're going home.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.760
It'll have to be a backy.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.270
Welcome to Poundbury,
in the heart of Dorset.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.830
No, you've not gone through a time portal.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.870
This is the 21st century.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.950
Here, the old world mixes with the new.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.710
The web designer queues for his bus
with the mediaeval inquisitor...

02:23.760 --> 02:24.750
.. and the ploughman

02:24.800 --> 02:27.390
shares his ploughman's
luncheon with the astronaut.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.590
And everyone gets along famously.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.110
So, come to Poundbury,

02:31.160 --> 02:34.150
where we put the social
back into social engineering.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.070
Some boys dream of playing
football for England,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.110
or marrying a beautiful woman.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.630
But not me.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.710
My dream was to always build a
mixed-use residential suburb

02:47.760 --> 02:49.360
on the outskirts of Dorchester.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.110
I'd now like to unveil this
statue of a Great Briton,

02:54.160 --> 02:56.470
probably Rapidly the
greatest Briton of them all,

02:56.520 --> 03:00.750
who went on to unite the
nation with his rousing oratory,

03:00.800 --> 03:02.270
great wit,

03:02.320 --> 03:04.270
and sheer bloody leadership.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.680
Mm...

03:10.400 --> 03:14.670
I'd now like to invite the entire
team behind this wonderful town,

03:14.720 --> 03:16.830
Dorset men through and through,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.560
to enter the Duchess of Cornwall.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.320
- Well, that's another royal
duty ticked off. - Two, one each.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.910
That's a bit weird.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.270
Yah!

03:35.320 --> 03:36.800
Come on, let's find the spa.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.110
Pippa!

03:41.160 --> 03:43.950
I was just passing. Thought
I'd drop this book up for you.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.350
Oh, wow! I love this series.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.310
And I'm getting really good
at staying inside the lines.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.950
How are things going with
you and Meghan, by the way?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.030
- Not good.
- Oh, yes?

03:54.080 --> 03:55.870
I think I love her too much.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.630
She works so hard,

03:57.680 --> 04:01.230
but I'm just a prince who's
had everything on a plate.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.440
Sooner or later, she's going to
realise I do literally nothing.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.070
I'm going to have to get a proper job.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.870
So, no plans on dumping her, then?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.870
Pippa! Ha-ha!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.430
What are you doing?!

04:13.480 --> 04:15.470
It's not 1975!

04:15.520 --> 04:16.790
In here it is!

04:17.839 --> 04:21.230
Bye, Harry. And if you
ever touch my arse again,

04:21.279 --> 04:24.590
you'll be picking up your
horsey teeth with a broken arm.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.470
I like her.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.990
Uncle Andrew, you're a royal who's
made his own way in business.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.390
I should say so. The way
I got the son-in-law,

04:32.440 --> 04:35.670
the president of Kazakhstan,
to buy my house for £3 million

04:35.720 --> 04:37.210
over the asking price.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.590
Hang on, you're not
wearing a wire, are you?

04:40.640 --> 04:43.310
But what happens in Kazakhstan
stays in Kazakhstan.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.630
Great people to deal with.

04:44.680 --> 04:48.350
They're the only people who haven't realised
our Royal Family's completely irrelevant.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.830
- Apart from the people who make the
crown. - Good point. - Now, listen,

04:51.880 --> 04:53.790
do you think there's any
way I could work for you?

04:53.840 --> 04:55.990
That's why I'm here. I've
got a big deal coming up,

04:56.040 --> 04:58.430
and you are vital to its success.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.950
I can offer a very attractive package.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.350
How does unpaid intern sound?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.790
Wow!

05:05.840 --> 05:06.990
You won't regret it.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.510
I always thought you'd be
just the bloke to guide me.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.560
Well, I'm a tremendously moral person.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.030
- Mummy! - Oh, hello, girls. A
bit up against it, actually.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.670
I've got to get my memoirs
finished by Monday.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.830
But you've already written two
memoirs in the last five years.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.790
But so much has happened since then.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.310
Like what?

05:32.360 --> 05:36.710
Well, for a start, Penguin offered
me 200 grand for another lot.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.750
But you've used all the good stuff up.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.430
The self-loathing, the comfort
eating, the positive thinking.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.630
I know! Oh, God, I've been
a bloody fool, haven't I?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.270
When will I learn?

05:48.320 --> 05:51.110
Right, we're going to
help you write this memoir.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.630
Only this time, we're going
to peel back the layers,

05:53.680 --> 05:55.110
and find the real Fergie.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.430
But that's what it says on
the cover of the first one.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.710
- Oh.
- Well, how about this time,

05:58.760 --> 06:01.310
we pull back the curtain to
find the real, real truth,

06:01.360 --> 06:04.790
behind the real, real, real Fergie.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.030
Well, that's easy to say. Well,
how are you going to do it?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.990
We're going to get you drunk...

06:10.040 --> 06:12.160
and ask you some questions.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.910
Well, where is it?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.190
I don't think your dad
would've built a town without

06:17.240 --> 06:19.550
a five star luxury spa and gym, do you?

06:19.600 --> 06:20.910
No, he wouldn't do that.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.310
The electricity went off again last night.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.670
But I'm just happy to help
Prince Charles fulfil his vision.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.470
Yeah, my bog's still not right.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.270
- Won't flush. - Worth it to know
that your water's being pumped

06:31.320 --> 06:33.070
by a replica 17th-century windmill.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.070
Yeah, and who wants a functioning toilet

06:35.120 --> 06:37.720
- when you've got a nice statue
of Prince Charles? - Yeah.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.310
There's something not
right about this place.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.710
Yah. I don't think there is a spa.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.790
I need to find Dad. Will
you be OK on your own?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.360
Yeah, of course. You go.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.030
Business, dearie?

06:59.160 --> 07:01.080
No, I'm fine, thank you.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.910
I've just done the maths.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.950
I'll never get £2 billion
being a pizza delivery man.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.110
Oh, pull yourselves together!

07:14.160 --> 07:16.790
That's the worst thing you
can say to a depressed person!

07:16.840 --> 07:19.150
All right, then. Cheer up?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.870
I'm going to have to sell everything.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.590
Shut up and have a drink.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.360
Or you're going to have to get a job.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.750
What?!

07:27.800 --> 07:29.720
Fuck this for a game of soldiers.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.910
- Hi, Uncle Andy.
- Ah-ah! We are in a work relationship now,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.190
and at work you will refer
to me as Randy Andy.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.390
Gosh, I'm learning so much.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.070
So, is this where you work, then?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
What are you wearing?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.910
Here. Go and put this on.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.630
It's what real businessmen wear.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
Righto.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.870
And...

07:55.920 --> 07:58.920
thanks for giving me this
opportunity, Randy Andy.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.480
Let's go to work!

08:07.840 --> 08:09.190
Always punch from the hip.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.750
And don't be afraid to bite
their ears in the clinch hit.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.830
Kate Middleton!

08:13.880 --> 08:16.590
I recognise that
sledgehammer right anywhere!

08:16.640 --> 08:18.310
Gypsy Ricky!

08:18.360 --> 08:20.990
It's been over ten years.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.030
- What have you been up to?
- Set up as a student, what about you?

08:24.080 --> 08:26.670
Well, I met Prince William at
university, then we got married,

08:26.720 --> 08:28.750
and eventually I'll be Queen.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.950
- You're THAT Kate Middleton?
- Yah, didn't you see?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.549
It was in all the newspapers.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.230
Well, I've heard of the name, but
I get all my news off social media.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.789
What with all of the algorithms,
it feeds me what I want to see,

08:37.840 --> 08:40.230
which is mainly boxing and naked ladies.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.549
I'm in an echo chamber.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.549
Well, I'll send you some wedding photos.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.790
Right you are. But how did you manage it?

08:45.840 --> 08:48.110
I did a fashion show in my bra and pants,

08:48.160 --> 08:50.030
and he came over and started chatting.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.760
No, I mean how did you get married?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.360
When you're still married to me?

08:57.720 --> 08:59.950
Oh, hello! What are you
two chatting about?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.390
Camilla, what are you doing here?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.910
You can't drink as much as I do and stay this
thin without putting a little bit of work in.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.590
- Aren't you going to introduce us?
- This is Gypsy Ricky.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.270
- He's an old friend of mine.
- A little bit more than a friend.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.790
- Oh, yes? - I'm sure Camilla
wants to go and warm up now.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.630
Oh, no rush. A little bit
more than a friend, you say?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.440
That's right. Kate and me...

09:21.480 --> 09:22.480
We be married.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.790
Not really. We jumped the broom
at a traditional grabbing ritual.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.190
But I've divorced him now by
saying "I divorce you" three times.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.710
Oh, but the divorce is only binding
if a gypsy notary from the original

09:34.760 --> 09:36.830
county at the broom
jumping is also present.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.510
So as I say, we still be...

09:39.560 --> 09:41.440
married.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
Papa.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.990
Ah, there you are. This is going
to be phase two, Poundbury.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.430
These mud huts are centred
around a little Waitrose.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.710
Dad, I've been having a
little look around the town.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.030
- Brilliant, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.630
Everything's made out of polystyrene and
no-one can park their car outside their house.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.190
Well, that's fully intentional.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.550
The landscape parking areas are far
away from the residential zones.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.510
- What if they have to bring a washing
machine home? - They won't need to.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.910
What's wrong with a bit of
elbow grease and a mangle?

10:11.960 --> 10:13.310
That's all right for you to say.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.430
You've never washed a pair
of gunties in your life.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.310
You're more interested in
putting up statues of yourself

10:18.360 --> 10:20.270
than fixing someone's boiler.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.790
Who's had a boiler installed?

10:21.840 --> 10:24.230
Don't you care that people don't
have heat and electricity?

10:24.280 --> 10:26.910
Most of Buckingham Palace doesn't
have heat and electricity.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.510
You can't let people live like this.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.750
It's not Britain in the 19th
century, or the Isle of Wight now.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.600
If you're not going to change
things in this town, I will.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.480
Who's had a boiler installed?

10:50.840 --> 10:54.310
'By now you will all have heard that
my first marriage to Gypsy Ricky,

10:54.360 --> 10:57.030
'renders my marriage to
Prince William null and void.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.630
'I therefore renounce
all royal privileges,

10:59.680 --> 11:02.830
'and intend to resume my
career of tarmacking drives.'

11:02.880 --> 11:05.670
Kate! I've been looking
for you everywhere.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.270
You finally won, Camilla.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.950
I'm leaving the royal family.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.360
What are you talking about?

11:12.120 --> 11:13.320
I see.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.950
You're not fooling me this time.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.030
You just want to announce
it to the press yourself.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.710
I would never do that.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.320
You see, like you, I once made a mistake.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.270
I was just a girl, and I was
madly in love with Charles.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.190
But then he had to go on naval manoeuvres,

11:36.240 --> 11:39.310
and I fell under the spell
of another gentleman.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.480
Well, I say gentleman, it
was the Argentine polo team.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.870
By the time Charles returned,
I was considered damaged goods.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.990
Charles was told he couldn't marry me.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.430
Gosh, you really were up for anything.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.840
It's in the past.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.590
But I didn't want the
same mistake to ruin you.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.150
But what shall I tell Wills?

12:01.200 --> 12:06.070
If he asks you, are you married
to a boxing gypsy called Ricky,

12:06.120 --> 12:07.480
by all means tell him.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.480
Otherwise, say nothing.

12:14.360 --> 12:19.470
That's it, mummy. Just one
more Harvey Wallbanger.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.240
She's ready.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.510
OK, Mummy, I'm going to take you back,

12:25.560 --> 12:28.270
when was your most exciting time?

12:28.320 --> 12:30.190
The 1980s.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.470
And where are you?

12:31.520 --> 12:35.310
I'm with John Travolta, and
there's foam everywhere.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.190
That sounds interesting.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.710
Stuart Hall keeps trying to interview me.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.030
Now she's remembering It's
A Royal Knockout again.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.350
OK, Mummy, go somewhere else.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.550
I'm at Clarence House.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.310
And there's a man there.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.120
I can't quite make him out.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.720
Fergie.

12:59.160 --> 13:03.030
Hello, Charles, I was
just looking for Andy.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.750
He's outside cutting the break cables

13:04.800 --> 13:06.470
on the Foreign Secretary's car.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.910
- It's a practical joke.
- He so funny.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.030
So he won't do that for some time.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.910
Oh, Fergie, we've denied
ourselves for too long.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.830
The dam is about to burst.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.840
In fact, a bit's trickling out now.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.830
But I love Andy.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.310
We both do. Although if I find
him tremendously irritating.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.990
Now show the future king
your freckly bangers.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.870
No, these freckly bangers
are for Andy's eyes only,

13:30.920 --> 13:33.710
and anyone who happens to be
at next week's Level 42 gig.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.120
- Mmmm.
- Charles, we mustn't!

13:42.240 --> 13:45.110
OMG, he Poldarked her!

13:45.160 --> 13:47.990
If we put this in Mummy's
book, she'll make millions.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.350
We can't, it will destroy
the royal family.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.710
They deserve it, they ruined Mummy's life.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.110
If it wasn't for them,

13:54.160 --> 13:57.030
she'd probably be a quite
good hotel receptionist by now.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.390
Oh, Charlie.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.230
I've got to be honest, Randy Andy,

14:02.280 --> 14:04.830
I'm not sure this is the
sort of professional look

14:04.880 --> 14:06.310
that's going to impress Meghan.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.630
What is this, Harry, I thought
you were a team player.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.070
Sorry, I just got a bit
confused why I had to dress

14:11.120 --> 14:12.630
as a 1980s prostitute.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.070
Ah, let me explain. You see
that gentleman over there?

14:16.120 --> 14:19.630
He's interested in buying 30 Typhoon jets.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.070
He's always been a big fan
of the British Royal Family,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.110
and particularly you,

14:24.160 --> 14:26.550
as well as the film Pretty Woman.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.830
Ah, so he wants to take me out
shopping and give me a makeover?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.310
Well, it's actually
much simpler than that.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.150
What he wants is for you to go
over there and sit on his lap,

14:36.200 --> 14:37.950
to start with.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.390
No, no, no, I don't think I'm up for that.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.990
This is important, Harry.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.670
British jobs are at stake.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.000
And, not that it matters, I'm in for 2%.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.520
OK. I'll do it.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.920
All right, mate.

15:01.040 --> 15:06.560
I would be honoured if you would
accept these three tins of tuna.

15:07.720 --> 15:12.470
And I want you to have this,
a humble packet of spaghetti.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.710
What are you doing?

15:13.760 --> 15:17.430
Well, it's Prince Charles Day, isn't
it? Like it is every Saturday.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.550
Listen to me. All of you.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.830
You shouldn't have to pay
homage to my dad like this.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.470
He isn't fulfilling the basic
legal requirements of a landlord.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.030
Terry, has he fixed your bog yet?

15:26.080 --> 15:29.230
No, he just keeps going, "It is done."

15:29.280 --> 15:31.950
That's just it, he needs
to send a bloke right.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.870
This whole town is a vanity project.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.750
Everywhere's called Prince Charles
Street or Prince Charles Avenue,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.150
that's why you keep getting lost.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.590
- Yeah, there's too many
architectural styles. - Exactly.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.430
One minute you're in
the 15th century Siena,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.270
the next, 19th century northern Germany.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.950
You can't be expected to live like this!

15:46.000 --> 15:49.310
And this statue here today is
about the eighth one he's put up.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.510
Plus, I don't like having to speak
with this West Country accent.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.030
Then rise up. Take back control.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.190
The time has come...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.720
to form your own Resident's Association.

16:01.200 --> 16:06.590
♪ A Resident's Association
will be a liberation

16:06.640 --> 16:11.390
♪ Where grievances are settled
by a form of arbitration

16:11.440 --> 16:13.790
♪ So all the toilets function

16:13.840 --> 16:16.470
♪ And we work on the assumption

16:16.520 --> 16:23.830
♪ That if required, a plumber
arrives within four hours! ♪

16:23.880 --> 16:27.390
I have seen pretty woman, but have
you seen Batman Versus Superman?

16:27.440 --> 16:30.710
It's awesome. They've kept the
darkness of the Batman character,

16:30.760 --> 16:32.310
but he's up against Superman.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.790
Harry? What the hell's going on?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.310
Poppa, what are you doing here?

16:36.360 --> 16:37.790
I still track your iPhone.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.470
Sentimental, I suppose.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.110
Can this wait five minutes?

16:41.160 --> 16:42.870
I see, you're exploiting Harry.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.790
He's a grown man, he can
make his own mind up.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.030
You know full well he can't.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.630
I'm just trying to show the woman I love

16:47.680 --> 16:49.150
that I can make it in the real world.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.590
Exactly.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.920
Now, run along.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.000
I warned you.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.550
- Wow.
- Come on, Harry.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.869
Sorry, Randy Andy.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.520
Sorry, Igor.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.349
Agh.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.910
Haven't been hit like that without
paying for it since the Navy.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.630
Ah.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.349
So, you see, Ricky, I've
made a life for myself now.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.109
I'm a happily married woman
with two small children.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.359
You and I, we're just so different.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.350
I don't care. You're my wife.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.150
If you wanted me to be your wife so
much, why did you sell me at a fair?

17:36.200 --> 17:39.070
I wanted a drink.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.550
And you've made absolutely no
effort to try to track me down.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.070
That's not true, I looked online.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.150
But, I couldn't find my
way around Ask Jeeves.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.230
I'm one of the most
famous woman in the world.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.870
You've got quite full of yourself
these last few years, ain't ya?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.390
That's why you need a good
long stint living in a lay-by.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.110
No, OK? enough.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.470
People change, Ricky.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.070
I've changed. I'm going to be the queen.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.350
No, you're not.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.630
You're going to be my misses

18:01.680 --> 18:04.880
and come to vintage car rallies
with me in the Cortina. Look.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.030
And if you don't agree,

18:08.080 --> 18:09.910
I'm going straight to the Huffington Post

18:09.960 --> 18:12.440
which I can get now cos
I started using AOL.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.150
Where are you going?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.950
Will! Will!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.790
What? I can't hear you!

18:23.840 --> 18:26.350
I need to speak to you about
the legality of our marriage.

18:26.400 --> 18:31.110
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle
of a revolution, talk later.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.590
'Perhaps I should have stopped.
I need to talk to someone.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.870
'Is leading a revolt against my
father even the right thing to do?'

18:39.320 --> 18:40.270
It is not.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.270
Your father is going to be king.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.390
- Charles I.
- That's right.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.550
I've had a type of spaniel named after me.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.190
Yeah, but on the other hand,
you provoked civil war.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.110
I don't care. The point is,
kings are always right.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.950
Even if they won't fix someone's bog?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.630
Especially if they won't
fix someone's bog.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.520
No, Charles I, people need bogs.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.750
Well, thanks for the lift.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.470
Are things still good with you and Meghan?

19:09.520 --> 19:12.230
Actually, I had a phone call
from her earlier and we broke up.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.150
What? Oh, Harry, come here.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.960
Well, I say broke up. I
mean, the signal broke up.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.830
Had to say "I love you" on the landline.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.160
Right.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.630
Mummy, it's finished!

19:28.680 --> 19:31.510
And Charles Poldarking you
is going to be dynamite.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.310
Thanks, girls.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.630
But I've just been watching
an old episode of Oprah

19:36.680 --> 19:41.910
and I think I might be suffering
from false memory syndrome.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.310
So you're saying Charles
didn't Poldark you?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.910
Sorry, girls.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.870
What am I going to do?

19:47.920 --> 19:51.070
If I don't hand a memoir in,
I'll have to give the money back.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.830
Sorry, Mummy, did you say
false memory syndrome?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.030
Yes, why?

19:55.080 --> 19:57.430
And did you ever meet Michael Jackson,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.830
who's now dead and can't sue?

20:00.880 --> 20:02.080
No.

20:03.240 --> 20:09.990
Oh, actually I did and he
Poldarked me on his fairground

20:10.040 --> 20:12.150
while his monkey was watching.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.950
Slow down.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.840
Ker-ching!

20:17.480 --> 20:19.830
Dear, Johnny, I'm leaving you.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.190
I don't love you and never have.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.270
I only agreed to marry
you as you had £2 billion,

20:25.320 --> 20:28.310
and now that you've lost it
all, I see things more clearly.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.000
Soz, Pips.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.760
Johnny!

20:39.880 --> 20:44.110
Pippa! Great news, I just
got all my money back.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.030
What? How?

20:46.080 --> 20:49.710
Some mates rallied round and
I lead a hostile takeover

20:49.760 --> 20:51.110
of the pizza delivery company.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.110
So you'll get all your money back?

20:53.160 --> 20:57.230
Yes, and more once I
strip the pension fund.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.190
Fancy coming out to the club to celebrate?

20:59.240 --> 21:02.160
Um, just got to get something.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.070
Such a shame your house burnt down.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.710
Oh, don't worry. I'll have it rebuilt.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.560
Didn't like the wallpaper, anyway.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.920
They're tearing down my statue
and hitting it with slippers!

21:30.840 --> 21:33.230
- Dad!
- What do you want?

21:33.280 --> 21:35.550
I'm with the townspeople
to demand the establishment

21:35.600 --> 21:39.270
of a Residents Association to
take over the running of Poundbury!

21:39.320 --> 21:41.390
And I demand your removal as leader!

21:41.440 --> 21:43.150
But Poundbury's my dream!

21:43.200 --> 21:45.360
It's the only thing I've ever achieved.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.590
It's no use turning on
the waterworks, Father,

21:48.640 --> 21:50.710
the people have spoken.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.790
Well, hold on. I mean,
maybe he could stay on

21:54.840 --> 21:56.670
as a sort of nominal leader.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.040
No, you need a clean break
to decide things for yourself.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.470
- But he does bring in a
lot of tourists. - Yeah.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.150
And He's someone to look up to,
you know, cos he's better than us.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.550
- He's not better than you.
- And he's a stabilising influence.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.150
Yeah, and sometimes we don't
know what we want and we lash out

22:12.200 --> 22:15.030
cos the world's changing
and we're frightened.

22:15.080 --> 22:19.150
Yes, I'd be so sort of
ceremonial head of Poundbury.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.670
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.390
In that scenario, I suppose all
the statues would go back up.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.630
- Oh, yeah. - Even a ceremonial head
will require some sort of income.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.670
You're one of the richest
men in the country.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.670
- Thmmm. - Oh, yeah,
you'll have to be paid.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.560
Then I accept.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.670
Camilla. This is unexpected.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.830
I just thought I'd set your
mind at rest about Gypsy Ricky.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.400
- Yes?
- I sorted out the problem.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.470
You're free.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.880
Well, that's wonderful, but how?

23:09.080 --> 23:10.870
- Wills.
- Kate.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.630
- Camilla.
- Wills.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.750
- Kate.
- How was the revolution?

23:14.800 --> 23:18.030
Well, they're going to keep Dad
on as a sort of ceremonial head

23:18.080 --> 23:20.110
and use a maintenance
company to fix the bogs.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.870
I was just about to say to Camilla

23:21.920 --> 23:24.830
how I think we've misunderstood
each other all these years.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.350
Yes.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.960
Perhaps we have.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.230
I think I've got the gist, you
social-climber sixth former.

23:33.280 --> 23:36.390
'And more on that story about the
original Magna Carta document

23:36.440 --> 23:38.510
'being found this morning in Runnymede.

23:38.560 --> 23:42.630
'Experts have just authenticated it
and it suggests the United Kingdom

23:42.680 --> 23:44.950
'should not be ruled
by the prime minister,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.680
'but by the Royal Family.'
