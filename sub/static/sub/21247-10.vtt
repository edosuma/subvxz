DISN
(ROARS)

00:58.275 --> 00:59.441
(NARRATOR READING)

01:01.078 --> 01:02.978
(KION READING)

01:13.124 --> 01:14.323
Careful with that branch!

01:14.992 --> 01:17.059
Remember, it represents peace!

01:17.361 --> 01:20.262
Put the mango for
the Peace Paint with
the rest of the fruit.

01:21.599 --> 01:25.167
And will someone please
make sure that the rocks
are clear of dirt?

01:26.003 --> 01:28.203
Quite an operation.
Totally!

01:28.239 --> 01:30.239
What do the elephants
call this ceremony again?

01:30.441 --> 01:32.274
<i> Kuba... Kubamusho?</i>

01:32.309 --> 01:33.308
<i> Ukumbusho.</i>

01:34.445 --> 01:36.411
It's a performance
that celebrates
the friendship

01:36.447 --> 01:39.248
between the elephants
and the lions
of the Pride Lands.

01:39.383 --> 01:41.383
MAKINI:
'Scuse me, Lion Guard.
Comin' through.

01:42.253 --> 01:44.019
Sorry I'm late, Ma Tembo.

01:44.054 --> 01:45.587
Makini, you're here.

01:45.623 --> 01:49.191
Rafiki just told me I'll be
painting the elephants
for the<i> Ukumbusho.</i>

01:49.226 --> 01:51.226
It's so exciting!

01:51.262 --> 01:55.197
Yes, and we've gathered
plenty of fruit for you
to make the Peace Paint.

01:55.399 --> 01:57.299
Oh, thank you, Ma Tembo!

01:57.468 --> 01:59.401
I'll get to work
making the paint
right now!

02:00.104 --> 02:01.203
Looking good, Ma Tembo.

02:01.438 --> 02:02.971
I hope so.

02:03.007 --> 02:05.374
When I was little, we had
the<i> Ukumbusho</i> every year.

02:06.177 --> 02:08.110
So many wonderful memories.

02:09.013 --> 02:12.181
And now that we have
a new Lion Guard to play
the original Lion Guard,

02:12.383 --> 02:14.149
the tradition can continue.

02:14.318 --> 02:15.417
Are you all ready
for your parts?

02:16.120 --> 02:17.085
Absolutely.

02:17.421 --> 02:18.387
Right, guys?

02:20.424 --> 02:21.423
Totally.
Affirmative.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.025
Okay.

02:23.194 --> 02:25.227
Excellent. You can
practice over there.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.296
Beshte! Beshte!
Guess what!

02:27.464 --> 02:31.200
Me and my mom are gonna be
in the<i> Ukumbuso</i> performance
tonight, too.

02:31.368 --> 02:35.037
She gets to be
the bravest elephant
and I get to be the strongest.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.040
<i> Poa</i> , Mtoto.
I'm sure you'll be great.

02:39.210 --> 02:42.010
Oh, they're all
so beautiful...

02:42.179 --> 02:44.413
Makini, we need
to get painted. Soon!

02:45.149 --> 02:47.049
The show starts
at moonrise.

02:47.318 --> 02:50.385
Yes. But which color
is the right color
to make first?

02:51.055 --> 02:53.055
Orange? Green? Yellow?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.256
Oh...

02:55.092 --> 02:56.058
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
<i> Schwari.</i>

02:56.460 --> 02:58.360
If there's
no right place
to start,

02:58.495 --> 03:00.929
then there's
no wrong place
to start.

03:02.199 --> 03:05.100
(DEEPLY) Can't elephants
and lions live
together in peace?

03:07.371 --> 03:08.937
I said...

03:09.240 --> 03:12.341
"Can't elephants
and lions live
together in peace?"

03:13.444 --> 03:14.409
And you say...

03:15.045 --> 03:16.445
I know. I know.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.147
Of course, we can.
We are both noble animals
who believe in peace.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.284
I think it's more
about getting the feeling.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.987
Should I do it faster?

03:25.122 --> 03:28.023
Not exactly how
I remember the<i> Ukumbusho</i>
of my youth.

03:28.259 --> 03:30.225
I know it seems
kinda rough now...

03:30.361 --> 03:32.261
Which is why
we're here.

03:32.296 --> 03:37.165
Oh, we came
as soon as we heard
the<i> Ukumbusho</i> was back on!

03:37.201 --> 03:39.434
Theatrics are our specialty!

03:40.104 --> 03:43.405
Nobody does drama like Timon!

03:44.141 --> 03:48.076
Honestly, Ma Tembo, I don't
know why you didn't ask us
to help in the first place.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.312
I think I know why...

03:50.481 --> 03:53.115
But right now,
I'll take all the help
I can get.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.051
All right,
Lion Guard, listen up.

03:56.287 --> 03:59.955
You may be
good at stopping rock slides
and vicious predators.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.324
But this is serious.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.926
Do ya hear me?

04:04.128 --> 04:05.160
Oh, no.

04:05.195 --> 04:07.062
I can't believe
I didn't think of this.

04:07.097 --> 04:08.363
Think of what, Ma Tembo?

04:08.399 --> 04:11.934
It's just been so long
since we've had an<i> Ukumbusho.</i>

04:11.969 --> 04:14.369
Naturally we can't
celebrate peace
with the lions

04:14.405 --> 04:16.038
without the Lion Guard.

04:16.073 --> 04:18.340
Lucky for you,
the Lion Guard's here.

04:18.976 --> 04:23.145
And even luckier,
we're an un-Bunga-lievable
Lion Guard!

04:23.380 --> 04:27.316
Yes, well... Traditionally,
the Lion Guard
in the<i> Ukumbusho</i>

04:27.985 --> 04:29.985
has always been... Lions.

04:30.287 --> 04:31.286
Traditionally.

04:31.322 --> 04:33.255
Nothing we can do about that.

04:33.290 --> 04:36.258
Yeah, tradition or not.
You can't make us lions.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.293
Ooh. I know.

04:38.329 --> 04:40.362
I can paint you
to look like lions.

04:40.397 --> 04:42.197
It will look amazing.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.967
Just a little paint here...

04:45.135 --> 04:47.035
I already look like a lion.

04:47.071 --> 04:48.103
(GIGGLES)

04:48.138 --> 04:49.338
Oh, right.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.405
Because you are a lion.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.275
So, I'll make
the rest of you
look amazing!

04:53.310 --> 04:54.276
Very well.

04:55.346 --> 04:57.212
Whatever it takes to get us
closer to tradition.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.083
Just be sure you have time
to paint the sunbursts
on the elephants, Makini.

05:01.118 --> 05:03.318
The performance
won't look right without them.

05:03.354 --> 05:07.389
This is King Simba's
first<i> Ukumbusho,</i>
so it has to be perfect.

05:07.424 --> 05:10.258
Oh, yes, Ma Tembo.
I totally understand.

05:10.294 --> 05:13.128
And don't worry
about the Lion Guard.

05:13.163 --> 05:16.965
We'll have them looking
and acting like lions
in no time!

05:17.001 --> 05:19.301
PUMBAA: You'll never
know the difference.

05:25.142 --> 05:26.108
So, Kion?

05:26.243 --> 05:28.043
Do they look
like lions to you?

05:28.312 --> 05:29.411
Uh...

05:29.446 --> 05:31.413
Yeah, c'mon, Kion.
Do we look great?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.315
Or really great?

05:33.350 --> 05:36.952
I've definitely
never seen
anything like it.

05:36.987 --> 05:38.086
That's what I thought.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.055
I look un-Bunga-lievable.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.323
That's one way
of putting it.

05:42.026 --> 05:46.061
Prepare yourselves
for the piece de resistance!

05:46.096 --> 05:47.129
BOTH: Ta-da!

05:47.264 --> 05:49.264
You see
any cheetahs here, Pumbaa?

05:49.433 --> 05:50.966
Not me!

05:51.135 --> 05:53.268
All I see is a lion.

05:53.303 --> 05:56.038
And what a lion!

05:56.073 --> 05:57.439
I look ridiculous.
Shh...

05:58.108 --> 05:59.441
You're spoiling the illusion.

06:00.978 --> 06:03.245
Ooh. Ooh.
What are you doing?

06:03.947 --> 06:08.116
Sorry. Even as a lion,
your fur is still so soft...

06:08.285 --> 06:11.119
Ugh! This costume is so weird!

06:11.155 --> 06:12.187
Come on, Fuli.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.955
You look just like
the rest of us.

06:13.991 --> 06:16.091
Why doesn't that
make me feel better?

06:16.326 --> 06:18.326
You know what?
You all look terrific.

06:18.962 --> 06:19.928
Good work, Makini.

06:21.398 --> 06:22.964
I know you're all
gonna do great
at the<i> Ukumbusho</i> tonight.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.200
Oh, it's almost sunset.

06:25.235 --> 06:27.202
And I still have to
paint the elephants!

06:28.172 --> 06:29.971
From the top, everybody.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.107
Pumbaa, you be Ma Tembo.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.076
Oh, good! Let me
get into character.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.012
(TRUMPETING)

06:37.314 --> 06:39.247
No, that's not right.
Let me try again.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.083
(TRUMPETING)

06:41.318 --> 06:43.985
Beautiful, Pumbaa! Beautiful!

06:44.121 --> 06:45.187
Now, Kion...

06:45.322 --> 06:47.189
You say
your first lines
to him.

06:47.357 --> 06:51.293
And remember,
looking like lions
is only part of the magic.

06:52.029 --> 06:54.229
Now, we gotta get you
acting like lions.

06:54.264 --> 06:56.031
I know! We can go on a hunt!

06:56.200 --> 06:58.166
Hunting does not a lion make.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.234
How would you know?

06:59.269 --> 07:01.903
We raised a lion.

07:02.206 --> 07:07.109
Right. Trust me, we know more
about lions than anyone else
in the Pride Lands!

07:07.311 --> 07:09.311
I think I might know
a little more...

07:09.346 --> 07:10.979
First thing you gotta do

07:11.014 --> 07:13.115
is strut around
like you own the place.

07:13.150 --> 07:15.183
Ugh! That's not right...
Kion, shh!

07:15.219 --> 07:16.985
Oh, yeah. I got this!

07:17.121 --> 07:19.387
(ROARS)

07:19.423 --> 07:21.022
That's one impressive roar.

07:21.158 --> 07:22.991
Are you new
to the Pride Lands, lion?

07:23.127 --> 07:24.993
Kion, it's me, Bunga.

07:25.229 --> 07:27.129
I must be really good at this.

07:27.397 --> 07:28.363
(SIGHS)

07:29.299 --> 07:31.133
You're going
to love it, Zito!

07:31.268 --> 07:34.369
This yellow sunburst
is going to be so pretty...

07:35.139 --> 07:37.139
Just as soon as I,

07:37.174 --> 07:38.140
uh...

07:40.043 --> 07:42.177
Uh-oh. Yellow...
Yellow...

07:42.346 --> 07:44.279
There's got to be
something yellow.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.281
Makini, what's going on?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.083
Well...

07:48.218 --> 07:51.019
It looks like I might have
run out of yellow paint.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.387
In the middle of my sunburst?

07:52.422 --> 07:54.389
I did have to use
a lot of yellow

07:54.424 --> 07:56.224
to make the Lion Guard
look like lions.

07:57.027 --> 07:59.928
Do you have any idea
how preposterous that sounds?

08:00.197 --> 08:02.898
The<i> Ukumbusho</i> will be ruined!

08:03.066 --> 08:04.332
Ruined?
What's happening?

08:04.368 --> 08:06.001
What's going on?

08:06.036 --> 08:08.904
Well, Makini here
wasted all her yellow paint

08:09.039 --> 08:12.307
on the Lion Guard
and now there's none left
for our sunbursts.

08:13.043 --> 08:14.976
Do you really
need a sunburst?

08:15.112 --> 08:19.080
What? You lions
don't appreciate tradition
at all!

08:19.116 --> 08:22.217
Kion, sunbursts represent
the Circle of Life.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.352
They're a big part
of the tradition.

08:24.388 --> 08:28.290
Or maybe you expect me
to go out there
with only half a sunburst!

08:28.325 --> 08:30.325
I don't even have
half a sunburst

08:30.360 --> 08:32.327
and I still have to rehearse
my scene with Bunga.

08:32.362 --> 08:36.932
That scene is the centerpiece
of the entire
<i>Ukumbusho</i> performance.

08:36.967 --> 08:39.234
Oh, no! I really
have ruined everything!

08:39.403 --> 08:41.269
You certainly have.

08:41.305 --> 08:43.371
Hey, we're going to
figure this out.

08:44.141 --> 08:47.042
We won't let
some yellow paint
ruin the<i> Ukumbusho.</i>

08:47.077 --> 08:49.377
What do you know about...
Listen to him, Zito.

08:50.047 --> 08:52.047
The Guard has always
come through for us.

08:52.082 --> 08:54.282
What if she made
more yellow paint?

08:54.318 --> 08:56.184
Okay... Makini,

08:56.386 --> 08:59.421
see if you can find
some more yellow fruit
in the forest.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.889
Fruit. Got it.

09:01.325 --> 09:03.925
Okay. Good.
In the meantime...

09:04.294 --> 09:06.928
Mtoto's mom,
you go rehearse with Bunga.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.931
Don't worry, Ma Tembo.
Everything's gonna be okay.

09:11.235 --> 09:12.934
Nope. No. Oh!

09:13.303 --> 09:17.105
Ooh, beautiful! No.
Yellow, Makini. Yellow!

09:18.408 --> 09:19.374
<i> Schwari...</i>

09:20.410 --> 09:21.910
(GASPS)

09:21.945 --> 09:22.978
Ohhh...

09:23.013 --> 09:24.379
I can crush these
and make paint

09:24.414 --> 09:27.249
that's even more beautiful
than the banana paint
I had before!

09:28.018 --> 09:30.385
'Scuse me, bees.
I really need these flowers!

09:31.355 --> 09:33.188
I have yellow!

09:33.223 --> 09:35.090
Oh, thank the Savannah.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.258
Good going, Makini.

09:36.393 --> 09:38.193
About time.

09:38.228 --> 09:41.963
Don't you think these flowers
will make an even
prettier yellow paint?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.199
Just finish painting me.

09:45.102 --> 09:47.068
Don't tell me, don't tell me.
I'll remember...

09:48.138 --> 09:49.170
Uh... Line?

09:50.007 --> 09:52.941
(SIGHS)
"We bravest can do anything."

09:53.143 --> 09:55.110
Of course we can.
What's my line?

09:55.279 --> 09:57.012
That is your line.

09:57.281 --> 09:59.214
"We bravest can do anything."

09:59.383 --> 10:00.382
Then my mom says,

10:01.685 --> 10:04.185
"We bravest can even
find peace when things
are most frightening."

10:04.454 --> 10:07.956
Got it. It's all in my head.
If I could find my head.

10:08.225 --> 10:10.025
But I'll
get my lines eventually.

10:11.395 --> 10:15.230
Okay, Kion.
After Ma Tembo passes
the Branch of Peace to you,

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
you pass it
to the fastest lion...

10:18.201 --> 10:19.167
Here. Go.

10:19.336 --> 10:20.335
(MUFFLED) With this branch,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.337
we will hasten
the day of peace.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.272
I can't understand her at all.

10:24.308 --> 10:26.274
(MUFFLED)
That's because I have
a stick in my mouth.

10:27.177 --> 10:28.143
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:28.478 --> 10:30.011
Here. Strongest. Go!

10:30.280 --> 10:34.182
(MUFFLED)
It takes great strength to
support peace between us.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.417
Couldn't
understand that either.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.387
It's the stick.
It's ruining everything!

10:42.492 --> 10:44.225
Oh! Oh! I know!
Kion!

10:44.494 --> 10:47.162
When the elephant tries to
give you the Branch of Peace,

10:47.364 --> 10:50.098
just say, "No thanks!"

10:50.233 --> 10:52.133
Brilliant! That solves it!

10:52.436 --> 10:53.401
No, it doesn't.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.037
The whole performance
is about peace.

10:56.273 --> 10:59.040
Oh, fine.
Don't take my advice.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.343
If you wanna go out there
and flop, be my guest!

11:01.378 --> 11:03.144
(TRUMPETING)

11:03.180 --> 11:05.113
Everyone!
The King is here!

11:05.349 --> 11:08.283
Take your places.
It's time to start the show!

11:08.318 --> 11:10.352
But I still don't have
my peace paint on yet!

11:11.054 --> 11:13.021
I got ya!
I just did four of these,

11:13.256 --> 11:16.124
I can practically
paint a sunburst
with my eyes closed.

11:16.326 --> 11:19.427
Ma Tembo, I am
looking forward to
this evening's celebration.

11:19.463 --> 11:23.264
I'll be interested to see
if the<i> Ukumbusho</i> is
as beautiful as I've heard.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.267
Yes, Your Majesty.
We shall see.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.111
Everybody ready?

11:36.146 --> 11:37.178
Let's do it.

Askari,

12:31.201 --> 12:33.201
leader of
the first Lion Guard,

12:33.236 --> 12:35.203
made peace with the elephants.

12:35.238 --> 12:36.237
Working together,

12:37.607 --> 12:41.075
the lions and elephants made
the Pride Lands
a safe home for everyone

12:41.111 --> 12:42.277
who respects
the Circle of Life.

12:43.146 --> 12:46.047
It is this peace
that we celebrate tonight.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.247
Told you it will all work out.

13:19.282 --> 13:20.248
Yes.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.349
So far so good.

13:23.253 --> 13:25.186
Greetings, wise elephants!

13:25.355 --> 13:27.055
My name is Askari.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.425
I am first leader
of the Pride Lands
Lion Guard.

13:30.460 --> 13:32.961
You have
nothing to fear from us.

13:32.996 --> 13:34.395
(BUZZING)
What is that?

13:35.432 --> 13:37.131
Hmm. That's strange.

13:37.467 --> 13:40.034
It sounds like...
Bees!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.069
(LOUD BUZZING)

13:41.104 --> 13:42.103
(TRUMPETING)

13:47.010 --> 13:48.109
What are they doing?

13:48.144 --> 13:49.177
No improvising!

13:49.479 --> 13:51.379
Careful! Look out!

13:52.449 --> 13:53.414
Ma Tembo?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.016
(TRUMPETING)

13:57.354 --> 13:59.387
Is this because
I didn't know my lines?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.289
I'm not sure
what's going on.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.292
But elephants on a rampage
could hurt someone!

14:04.327 --> 14:05.326
Or themselves!

14:05.362 --> 14:07.195
C'mon. We gotta stop 'em.

14:07.364 --> 14:11.099
Till the Pride Lands end...
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

14:12.269 --> 14:14.102
(TRUMPETING)
(SQUAWKING)

14:22.045 --> 14:23.311
ONO: This way.
Through the trees.

14:27.984 --> 14:28.950
(GRUNTS)

14:29.986 --> 14:31.419
Elephants!
Calm down!

14:32.122 --> 14:33.254
Why are the elephants
so scared?

14:33.456 --> 14:36.057
Well, elephants
are afraid of bees.

14:36.192 --> 14:38.092
But I didn't realize
they were this afraid.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.161
Elephants are afraid of bees?

14:40.196 --> 14:41.429
Common knowledge, really.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.431
Huh. Hard to believe
that something so big

14:43.466 --> 14:45.400
can be afraid of
something so delicious.

14:46.036 --> 14:49.003
So how are we gonna get
rampaging elephants
to stop rampaging?

14:49.172 --> 14:50.972
Why don't we
ask those elephants?

14:52.042 --> 14:53.141
(ALL SHOUT)

14:55.178 --> 14:56.144
(PANTING) Any bees on me?

14:56.413 --> 14:57.378
Don't see any.

14:58.048 --> 15:00.181
So the bees
stopped chasing you...

15:00.383 --> 15:02.951
But they're still after
the other elephants.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.019
I guess so. But why?

15:05.255 --> 15:06.487
Hmm.

15:06.523 --> 15:09.257
You weren't in the show,
but Ma Tembo
and the others were.

15:09.426 --> 15:13.061
And they're
wearing the yellow paint
that Makini made from flowers.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.295
Of course!

15:14.331 --> 15:16.364
The bees are attracted
to the pollen
from the flowers!

15:17.233 --> 15:19.400
We have to wash that pollen
off the elephants!

15:20.103 --> 15:21.269
Good thinking, Kion.

15:21.304 --> 15:23.171
Except it's the middle
of the Dry Season.

15:23.306 --> 15:26.207
Where are we going to find
enough water to wash
a bunch of giant elephants?

15:26.443 --> 15:28.209
ONO: We better
figure it out fast.

15:31.014 --> 15:31.980
Herd of buffalo...

15:33.183 --> 15:34.315
Right in the elephants' path!

15:35.151 --> 15:37.051
Fuli, go warn the buffalo!

15:37.087 --> 15:38.252
We'll stay on the elephants.

15:38.288 --> 15:39.354
You got it, Kion!

15:39.389 --> 15:40.355
<i>Huwezi!</i>

15:41.391 --> 15:42.390
Vuruga Vuruga!

15:42.425 --> 15:44.325
Buffalo! You need to
get out of here!

15:44.995 --> 15:46.060
Right now!

15:46.096 --> 15:49.263
Leave? This is one of the
few grazing grounds left.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.100
Who do you think you are?
Telling us what to do!

15:52.135 --> 15:54.202
It's me, Fuli.
From the Lion Guard.

15:56.272 --> 15:59.273
The costume. Of course.
Ugh. I knew
I looked ridiculous.

16:00.076 --> 16:02.944
Long story. Elephants
are coming fast.
You gotta move.

16:03.113 --> 16:04.379
And why should we
listen to you,

16:04.414 --> 16:07.915
weird looking
cheetah-lion thing that we've
never seen before?

16:07.951 --> 16:08.950
I don't have time for this.

16:10.220 --> 16:14.022
Hmm. (GRUFFLY)
Because I am something
you've never seen before.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.190
I only come out
on the full moon

16:16.226 --> 16:18.259
to eat buffalo!

16:18.294 --> 16:19.260
(SNORTS)

16:19.396 --> 16:21.396
If I were you, I'd run.

16:21.431 --> 16:22.930
Now!

16:22.966 --> 16:23.998
(GROWLS)

16:24.968 --> 16:25.933
(ALL GASP)

16:28.204 --> 16:31.239
Maybe looking ridiculous
isn't so bad after all.

16:31.374 --> 16:32.373
(ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)

16:32.409 --> 16:33.975
Whoa!<i> Huwezi!</i>

16:38.148 --> 16:39.113
Poor Mtoto.

16:39.282 --> 16:41.149
Looks like the bees
are bugging him too.

16:41.184 --> 16:43.151
Ah! Go! Away!

16:43.186 --> 16:44.152
Bees!

16:50.226 --> 16:52.093
Aw, I was sure
that would work!

16:52.262 --> 16:54.128
May be it didn't work
on the bees,

16:54.264 --> 16:56.297
but it might work
on the paint.

16:56.332 --> 16:57.365
It could blast the paint off!

16:58.001 --> 17:00.201
Then the bees
wouldn't have
anything to go after.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.202
I'll tell Mtoto.

17:02.205 --> 17:04.005
Mtoto!
Fuli?

17:04.140 --> 17:06.074
Don't blast the bees.
Blast the paint.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.075
That's what they're after.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.276
Trust me.

17:08.311 --> 17:10.178
Um...
Uh, okay!

17:10.346 --> 17:12.346
(TRUMPETING)

17:12.382 --> 17:13.381
(PANTING)

17:13.416 --> 17:14.382
It worked!

17:14.984 --> 17:15.950
All right.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.151
Beshte!

17:17.187 --> 17:18.152
You saved me!

17:18.955 --> 17:20.922
Thanks.
You're welcome.

17:21.157 --> 17:22.356
Maybe he can't tell us apart.

17:23.026 --> 17:24.358
You know, since we all
look like lions.

17:25.195 --> 17:26.994
That must be it.

17:27.230 --> 17:29.263
Now we just gotta
take care of the others.

17:32.335 --> 17:33.334
<i> Hapana!</i>

17:33.369 --> 17:35.236
They're heading
towards Sehemu Pass!

17:35.271 --> 17:37.038
Sehemu Pass?

17:37.073 --> 17:38.973
But that pass
is too narrow for elephants.

17:39.109 --> 17:40.141
They could get stuck.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.944
Actually, that might not
be a bad thing.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.946
Indeed! And I know a shortcut.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.284

18:01.097 --> 18:02.063
The bees!

18:02.298 --> 18:03.264
They're gone.

18:03.399 --> 18:05.967
Why?
It was the pollen
in the paint.

18:06.269 --> 18:07.935
Once Mtoto blew it off,

18:08.071 --> 18:10.104
the bees weren't
attracted to you any more.

18:10.140 --> 18:11.139
Kion!

Zito and Johari

Oh, no! My mom...

18:53.216 --> 18:55.183
Don't worry, Mtoto.
We'll help her.

Leave me alone, bees!

Mom!

19:07.931 --> 19:09.063
Mtoto! Stop!

19:10.366 --> 19:12.233
All those trees
she knocked down were holding
the hill in place.

19:13.036 --> 19:15.169
The ground's too dry.
It won't hold her weight.

19:15.205 --> 19:17.071
The whole cliff
could collapse at any second.

19:17.106 --> 19:19.941
I got this.

When did I get here?

19:42.098 --> 19:43.064
Ooh!

19:45.268 --> 19:46.234
It's okay.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.970
You're the bravest, remember?

19:49.205 --> 19:52.006
And we bravest
can do anything.

19:52.208 --> 19:57.178
We bravest can even
find peace when things
are most frightening.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.379
That's my line.

19:59.182 --> 20:00.948
Hey, at least I remembered it.

20:01.150 --> 20:03.251
(LAUGHS) So you did.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.021
Okay. (BREATHES DEEPLY)
I'm okay.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.062
Good idea.

20:15.098 --> 20:16.063
(GASPS) Whoa!

20:17.133 --> 20:18.132
Thank you, Bunga.

20:18.368 --> 20:21.369
Together, we bravest
really can do anything.

20:23.206 --> 20:24.972
Ma Tembo.
Are you all right?

20:25.275 --> 20:27.275
Yes, Your Highness. Thank you.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.243
I'm so sorry we panicked,

20:29.279 --> 20:30.978
but... Bees!

20:31.214 --> 20:32.313
They can fly up our trunks

20:32.348 --> 20:35.216
and sting us.
It's very, very painful.

20:35.251 --> 20:36.450
That sounds awful.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.119
You can't imagine.

20:38.254 --> 20:40.454
Ma Tembo, I am so, so sorry.

20:41.090 --> 20:43.124
I never should have
used flowers
to make the paint.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.160
It's okay, Makini.
You didn't know.

20:46.195 --> 20:50.164
(GASPS) Maybe I can find
some more yellow fruit
and repaint you!

20:50.300 --> 20:52.166
It'll look amazing!

20:52.201 --> 20:55.136
Actually, I know
it's not tradition,

20:55.305 --> 20:59.240
but maybe we should consider
finishing the<i> Ukumbusho</i>
without any paint?

20:59.475 --> 21:03.344
It's difficult for elephants
to break with tradition.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.114
Then why not
think of it as starting
a new tradition?

21:07.984 --> 21:10.217
I like the sound of that.

21:10.253 --> 21:11.285
(TRUMPETS)

21:11.321 --> 21:12.286
Sounds good to me.

21:13.056 --> 21:14.221
Although I still
have my paint.

21:14.424 --> 21:16.424
Not for long! (TRUMPETS)

21:18.094 --> 21:20.361
Wow. Great job, Mtoto.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.363
Well, I am the strongest.

21:22.398 --> 21:25.333
Paint or no paint,
I still get to say
my lines, right?

21:26.102 --> 21:29.003
Just be sure you don't say
my lines this time.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.137
No promises.

21:30.440 --> 21:34.442
Then let
the new<i> Ukumbusho</i> begin.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.111
All right.
You heard the elephant.

21:37.313 --> 21:39.113
Let's get this show started!

21:39.349 --> 21:41.349
Places, everyone! Places!

21:42.418 --> 21:44.285
Greetings, wise elephants!

21:45.088 --> 21:46.454
My name is Askari.

21:46.489 --> 21:50.124
I am first leader
of the Pride Lands
Lion Guard.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.259
You have nothing
to fear from us.

21:53.129 --> 21:58.366
And you, wise lions,
have nothing
to fear from us.
