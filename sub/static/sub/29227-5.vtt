"The Affair"...

00:05.714 --> 00:07.649
I wish I had your life.

00:07.737 --> 00:09.688
And you have a whole world that
needs you.

00:09.797 --> 00:10.943
How do I get that?

00:11.032 --> 00:12.540
I'm having
a very difficult time

00:12.628 --> 00:14.619
- believing that I'm your type.
- Oh, that's probably because

00:14.706 --> 00:17.055
you don't have the faintest
idea what my type is.

00:17.173 --> 00:19.063
He's fucking using you,
Helen.

00:19.151 --> 00:21.696
He wants to fuck you
so he feels closer to me.

00:21.784 --> 00:23.384
Can't you see
how pathetic that is?

00:23.510 --> 00:25.196
Ignore his dying wishes?

00:25.300 --> 00:27.194
- His soul cannot be released
- Are you insane?

00:27.282 --> 00:28.501
Unless he's cremated.

00:28.589 --> 00:29.784
Sierra, when's
the last time you slept?

00:29.871 --> 00:31.470
A day ago, two days ago,
I don't know.

00:31.558 --> 00:32.966
He needs to eat
and you need to sleep,

00:33.053 --> 00:34.907
so let's just fix
these problems right now

00:34.995 --> 00:36.538
and then we'll sort out
the rest, okay?

00:36.626 --> 00:38.588
Watching this movie
getting made, it's bringing up

00:38.683 --> 00:40.758
a lot of stuff, and I'm not
handling it properly.

00:40.896 --> 00:41.993
I'm sorry.

02:32.803 --> 02:34.404
Please stop crying.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.576
Please just go back
to sleep.

02:42.216 --> 02:44.178
Hey, hey, hey.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.224
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

02:46.312 --> 02:47.516
You're fine.

02:47.696 --> 02:49.529
I know.
I see we're up.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.873
I see we're up.
I know.

02:51.983 --> 02:53.279
What's wrong?

02:53.465 --> 02:54.928
What's wrong, huh?

02:55.865 --> 02:56.918
What's wrong?

02:57.006 --> 02:58.295
Are you hungry?

02:59.339 --> 03:01.630
No?
Does your tummy hurt?

03:02.967 --> 03:04.709
It's okay,
I know.

03:11.862 --> 03:13.448
I know, buddy.

03:15.042 --> 03:17.737
I know.
I know.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.300
Hey.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.417
Hey, hey.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.885
Hey, boo.

03:35.973 --> 03:37.589
Listen to Mommy.

03:38.990 --> 03:41.775
I've got a really big audition
today, okay?

03:42.644 --> 03:45.292
I really need to get this job
for both of us.

03:45.449 --> 03:48.628
So if you could just,
just stop crying...

03:49.143 --> 03:50.495
just a second,

03:51.095 --> 03:53.815
I know it's really hard
and I know your tummy hurts.

03:55.595 --> 03:57.237
Just try to go to sleep.

04:02.011 --> 04:03.214
Hi.

04:05.282 --> 04:06.454
He okay?

04:06.822 --> 04:07.823
Yeah.

04:07.911 --> 04:10.386
He has colic,
so he's always like this.

04:13.292 --> 04:15.751
Bungalow 8.
Use only the visitor spots, please.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.666
Great. Thank you.

04:23.804 --> 04:24.878
It's okay.

04:24.966 --> 04:26.686
It's okay. It's okay.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.659
Ugh.

04:43.301 --> 04:44.551
You are enough.

04:54.761 --> 04:55.901
Okay.

05:29.845 --> 05:31.095
Okay.

05:46.975 --> 05:49.055
What did I just say, Berthe?

05:49.303 --> 05:52.193
I beg of you,
leave me alone.

05:54.681 --> 05:56.597
Did I not say
leave me alone?

05:57.971 --> 06:00.560
Leave me alone, child!

06:02.310 --> 06:04.006
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:04.192 --> 06:05.295
I'm sorry.

06:05.391 --> 06:08.131
Did you cut yourself?
We'll bandage that...

06:08.219 --> 06:09.803
Thank you for coming in,
Sienna.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.646
- Oh, Sierra.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Sierra.

06:12.754 --> 06:14.310
Cool. Uh, thank you.

06:14.763 --> 06:15.843
I'll just...

06:16.040 --> 06:17.440
Delilah.

06:22.622 --> 06:24.279
Lilah. Lilah.

06:24.387 --> 06:25.818
Lilah.

06:25.906 --> 06:27.445
So good to see you.

06:27.533 --> 06:28.613
Oh.

06:28.701 --> 06:30.441
- How have you been?
- Oh, good.

06:30.529 --> 06:32.139
I've just been waiting
for you to call me.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.232
The new script is dynamite.
I positively love what I read.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.556
Well, let's see
what you can do.

06:36.643 --> 06:37.893
Okay.

06:51.809 --> 06:53.138
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:53.929 --> 06:57.278
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:57.415 --> 07:01.044
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

07:01.232 --> 07:04.130
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

07:07.033 --> 07:09.138
One second. One second.

07:20.084 --> 07:21.679
Oh, you're so stupid.

07:21.971 --> 07:25.132
Oh, you're so stupid.
You're so stupid.

07:25.232 --> 07:26.898
You're so stupid.

07:28.150 --> 07:29.163
Miss?

07:29.452 --> 07:31.198
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

07:31.286 --> 07:32.991
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God,
you're so sweet.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.103
I'm-I'm just... I'm running
a scene and it's-it's

07:35.191 --> 07:36.466
kind of a rough one,
so I'm good.

07:36.553 --> 07:38.671
Thank you so much.
I love your hat.

08:00.638 --> 08:01.638
Fuck.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.342
Hello? Sweetheart?

08:06.459 --> 08:08.521
Hey, Mom,
can I call you back?

08:09.396 --> 08:11.757
He has
some strong lungs, Sierra.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.740
How old is he now?

08:15.776 --> 08:17.856
He's four months and one week.

08:17.944 --> 08:19.543
And I still haven't met him?

08:19.631 --> 08:22.303
It's ridiculous.
I'm his grandmother.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.840
Well, you've...
you've been in Nepal, Mom.

08:25.928 --> 08:27.303
Well, honey, I'm back now.

08:27.391 --> 08:28.928
How about I stop by
this evening?

08:29.149 --> 08:30.451
Will you be home around six?

08:30.609 --> 08:33.115
Oh, of course you will.
Where else would you be?

08:36.178 --> 08:38.383
Sierra, are you there?

08:38.470 --> 08:39.919
Have I lost you?

08:40.493 --> 08:43.010
No, no.
No, I'm-I'm here, Mom.

08:43.097 --> 08:45.607
Um... sure.

08:46.506 --> 08:47.826
Sure, that sounds wonderful.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.615
Eddie can't wait to meet you.

08:50.011 --> 08:51.803
I talk about you all the time.

09:05.123 --> 09:06.745
Alexa, what time is it?

09:06.887 --> 09:08.818
The time is 5 p.m.

09:29.259 --> 09:31.261
Okay.

09:38.964 --> 09:40.587
Oh, my God.

09:40.793 --> 09:42.430
Look at you two.

09:43.026 --> 09:45.329
Hello, little love.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.899
- Hi, Mom.
- He's so handsome.

09:48.868 --> 09:50.298
Mwah.

09:50.679 --> 09:52.696
Hello, little angel.

09:52.784 --> 09:54.235
Come in.

09:56.355 --> 09:58.717
I love what
you've done with the house.

09:58.805 --> 10:00.696
It looks so lived in.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.592
I'm so glad I was able

10:02.680 --> 10:04.758
to wrestle it away
from your father.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.032
Have you heard from him?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.799
Um, not recently, no.

10:09.887 --> 10:10.922
Hmm.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.172
Well, you're finally getting

10:13.260 --> 10:16.399
that sibling
you've always wanted.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.789
And Eddie gets an uncle
and a playmate.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.133
Wait. What?

10:24.221 --> 10:25.625
He didn't tell you?

10:25.713 --> 10:26.758
No.

10:26.846 --> 10:29.071
Well, he should
have told you.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.881
And next time you see him,

10:30.969 --> 10:32.633
you can tell him
to stop dyeing his hair

10:32.720 --> 10:34.641
because he looks ridiculous.

10:35.039 --> 10:37.216
Well, you look great, Mom.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.717
That's kind of you to say,

10:39.804 --> 10:42.524
but...
I look ghastly.

10:42.855 --> 10:44.854
When did I get so old?

10:45.787 --> 10:47.557
Yes.

10:47.709 --> 10:50.507
May I hold my grands...
May I hold...

10:50.674 --> 10:51.815
Can I hold him?

10:51.903 --> 10:53.566
Oh, no. Um...

10:54.036 --> 10:55.355
He just, he doesn't like
being away from me.

10:55.442 --> 10:57.592
Sierra, I can handle
a crying baby.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.580
I know, but it's, like,
attachment parenting...

10:59.668 --> 11:01.431
It's not, it's... That's not
what you're doing, honey.

11:01.518 --> 11:02.963
- Okay.
- Come here, my lovebug!

11:03.051 --> 11:04.190
Okay. I just...

11:04.278 --> 11:06.191
- You know what? Okay.
- Okay, love.

11:06.311 --> 11:07.557
- Come here.
- Yeah.

11:07.645 --> 11:09.099
Yeah. Let's go.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.299
Here we go.

11:11.510 --> 11:12.784
I love you.

11:13.752 --> 11:15.440
Look at that face.

11:15.964 --> 11:18.627
- I'm your family.
- Oh. Shit.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.343
- What?
- Um, it's my agent.

11:21.595 --> 11:23.258
Take it.

11:23.775 --> 11:24.948
Honey.

11:25.045 --> 11:27.050
Take the call.
We're fine.

11:27.261 --> 11:30.049
- I've got him.
- Okay.

11:30.136 --> 11:32.042
Oh, we're so good.

11:32.172 --> 11:33.675
Who's the best boy
I know?

11:35.503 --> 11:36.633
Hey, Zach.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.415
Leif Devlin
just called me himself,

11:39.503 --> 11:40.550
I shit you not.

11:40.637 --> 11:43.159
Said you were "unique talent."

11:43.247 --> 11:46.050
Uh, really?
I thought he hated me.

11:46.261 --> 11:47.784
Nope. You got the part.

11:47.884 --> 11:49.081
Congrats.

11:49.169 --> 11:51.331
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

11:51.428 --> 11:53.758
Just one thing:
they need you on set tomorrow

11:53.845 --> 11:55.360
during the day
for a costume fitting,

11:55.448 --> 11:57.049
and they start shooting
tomorrow night.

11:57.198 --> 12:00.008
The actress you're replacing
put them way behind schedule.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.924
I'm messengering you over
a script right now.

12:02.011 --> 12:03.924
Should be there soon.
The good news is

12:04.011 --> 12:05.705
they're shooting
the scene you auditioned with.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.174
I told them
it wouldn't be a problem.

12:07.261 --> 12:09.448
- You'll make it work, right?
- Y-Yeah, of course.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.831
- Of course.
- Awesome. So psyched for you.

12:11.919 --> 12:14.042
Okay. Thank you.

12:14.519 --> 12:16.390
B-Bye.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.579
Shit.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.628
Oh, he's so easy, my God.

12:23.716 --> 12:25.587
Look at him
just play by himself.

12:25.675 --> 12:28.256
That's a sign of
real emotional intelligence.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.221
You were never like that.

12:31.405 --> 12:33.484
I'm sure it's my fault...

12:33.704 --> 12:36.326
That you were always so needy.

12:36.414 --> 12:38.854
Your mommy was
very exhausting.

12:39.178 --> 12:41.346
She was exhausting.

12:41.778 --> 12:44.651
Was I... was I
really that bad?

12:44.739 --> 12:47.120
Ah,
you were my little terrorist.

12:48.311 --> 12:50.266
Honey, I'm kidding.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.581
You're so sensitive.

12:52.876 --> 12:54.539
So what did Zach say?

12:54.790 --> 12:56.371
Please tell me he got you
an audition or something,

12:56.458 --> 12:58.219
or I'll really have to call.

12:58.307 --> 13:00.258
You know he used to be
Jeremy's assistant.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.128
He was a suck-up
even then.

13:02.230 --> 13:05.809
Actually, I just got cast
in the next Leif Devlin film.

13:06.636 --> 13:09.339
Is that the new
Madame Bovary project?

13:10.141 --> 13:11.554
What part?

13:11.964 --> 13:14.378
Um, Bovary.

13:16.071 --> 13:17.317
That's incredible.

13:17.737 --> 13:19.143
Wow.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.964
Leif Devlin, he's a really
big deal right now.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.092
I know.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.393
I-I have to be on set tomorrow.

13:26.779 --> 13:28.682
Fuck. I have to find
a babysitter.

13:28.770 --> 13:30.870
I'm gonna, I'm gonna text Helen.

13:31.432 --> 13:32.758
Who's Helen?

13:32.845 --> 13:34.321
Uh, she's my next-door neighbor.

13:34.409 --> 13:36.425
She's been so incredible
since he was born.

13:36.512 --> 13:38.128
She's been like
a second mother to me.

13:40.348 --> 13:42.760
Well, I'm here.

13:42.848 --> 13:44.386
Why don't I do it?

13:45.643 --> 13:47.518
You know,
what's better than family?

13:47.729 --> 13:49.378
- Um...
- This-this part,

13:49.466 --> 13:51.917
it's-it's a really big deal
for you, lovebug.

13:53.698 --> 13:56.466
Um... Yeah.

13:56.553 --> 13:58.425
That, um,
that would be amazing.

13:58.651 --> 14:00.636
Then it's settled. Oof.

14:00.724 --> 14:03.612
I'm just gonna eat you
all up tomorrow. Yes.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.386
You must be so nervous.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.104
Hey, I'm here.

14:09.192 --> 14:11.573
Let's-let's just start
running it, right?

14:12.136 --> 14:13.393
Oh.

14:13.637 --> 14:14.823
No, I think that's fine.

14:14.911 --> 14:17.026
I'm-I'm... We're actually
shooting the scene

14:17.178 --> 14:18.842
that, um,
that I auditioned with,

14:18.929 --> 14:20.902
so, you know, I think they liked
the way that I did it.

14:20.989 --> 14:22.632
Oh, no, no, no.
A-A director never wants

14:22.720 --> 14:24.675
an actor to just do
what he did in the audition.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.471
No, you have to come in tomorrow
having, you know, grown.

14:27.559 --> 14:30.382
So i-if you memorized
the scene, just, you know,

14:30.470 --> 14:32.729
just show me what you did.

14:35.037 --> 14:36.581
Um, okay.

14:36.854 --> 14:39.136
Yeah. I'd ap... Uh, yeah,
I'd appreciate your help.

14:39.224 --> 14:40.698
It's my pleasure.

14:40.970 --> 14:42.393
Whenever you're ready.

14:42.481 --> 14:46.253
And don't rush, 'cause...
you have a tendency to rush.

14:47.110 --> 14:48.151
Okay.

14:49.595 --> 14:50.964
Are you gonna sit?

14:51.729 --> 14:54.206
W... I mean,
do you want me to stand up?

14:54.294 --> 14:56.346
Well, I mean, is that
what you did in the audition?

14:56.434 --> 14:58.423
- Yeah, okay. It's... Okay.
- Okay.

14:58.511 --> 14:59.893
Um...

15:00.157 --> 15:02.098
Well... Okay.

15:04.419 --> 15:05.675
It's weird. Okay.

15:05.762 --> 15:07.383
So, it's the...
it's the scene with, like,

15:07.470 --> 15:09.169
the daughter and...

15:09.595 --> 15:11.427
All right.

15:18.261 --> 15:20.192
Darling, let go of my apron.

15:21.261 --> 15:23.294
Mummy does not want to play.

15:26.261 --> 15:28.354
I'm not feeling well, darling.

15:28.442 --> 15:30.083
You have plenty of toys
littered about.

15:30.176 --> 15:31.924
I can barely hear you.

15:32.152 --> 15:33.107
What?

15:33.231 --> 15:35.008
I... You need to speak up.

15:35.095 --> 15:38.216
I mean, this Bovary may be
a retelling, but it's still

15:38.303 --> 15:40.020
a period piece,
it's not mumblecore.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.299
Okay.

15:41.387 --> 15:42.552
Um...

15:47.022 --> 15:48.512
Okay.

15:51.107 --> 15:53.114
Darling, let go of my apron.

15:53.762 --> 15:55.340
Mummy does not want to play.

15:55.428 --> 15:57.717
- Where are you right now?
- I don't, um...

15:57.804 --> 15:59.966
Because you're-you're
not in your body.

16:00.301 --> 16:01.997
You need
to ground yourself.

16:02.092 --> 16:04.729
You know, the-the very first
time that I worked with Altman,

16:04.817 --> 16:07.864
I physicalized everything
about that character.

16:07.997 --> 16:09.747
I mean everything.

16:09.887 --> 16:13.106
And then I got nominated
for every award in the book,

16:13.194 --> 16:15.475
and I was 22
and it was really overwhelming.

16:15.563 --> 16:17.393
But the point is,

16:17.512 --> 16:18.755
the reason all that happened
is because

16:18.842 --> 16:21.506
I wasn't stuck.
I wasn't locked inside my head.

16:21.863 --> 16:23.112
Okay?

16:25.270 --> 16:26.592
This little daughter,

16:26.679 --> 16:30.122
she is like an albatross
around your neck.

16:31.053 --> 16:33.011
I need to feel that
from you.

16:36.668 --> 16:37.959
Okay.

16:47.868 --> 16:50.051
Darling, let go of my apron.

16:50.975 --> 16:53.083
Mummy does not want to play.

16:55.423 --> 16:58.362
Mummy's not feeling well.
I've asked you nicely. Please.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.926
You have so many toys
littered about.

17:01.014 --> 17:02.674
Berthe, what did I just say?!

17:02.762 --> 17:04.133
- Sorry.
- What?

17:04.300 --> 17:05.848
- You were really onto something.
- Sorry.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.856
I... It's like
I-I really just feel

17:07.944 --> 17:10.191
like I should do it the way
that I did it in the audition,

17:10.278 --> 17:12.192
because now I'm-I'm, like,
just getting confused now.

17:12.279 --> 17:14.192
Sierra, breathe.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.990
Just breathe.

17:18.891 --> 17:23.395
The performance you think you're
conveying is not coming across.

17:25.707 --> 17:28.481
You know what, Mom,
I-I really think I've got this.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.254
- You don't.
- No, I think I do.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.122
I've been in this industry
30 years.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.098
I mean, how many sets
have you been on?

17:35.186 --> 17:37.516
I've been on
a bunch of sets, Mom.

17:37.803 --> 17:39.879
Like, dozens, I think,

17:39.967 --> 17:43.506
before Dad forced you to
actually send me to school.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.317
Wait. I'm sorry.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.848
That... I didn't mean that
how it sounded.

17:54.936 --> 17:58.528
You know, I-I loved
having you on set with me

17:58.645 --> 17:59.842
when you were little.

17:59.929 --> 18:01.495
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.041
And I'm sorry
if you're angry with me

18:03.129 --> 18:05.307
because I wasn't here
when Eddie was born.

18:05.395 --> 18:07.973
And I'm sorry if you feel like
you need to attack me right now.

18:08.442 --> 18:10.216
And I may sound
a little upset,

18:10.303 --> 18:12.592
but... I'm sure
I'll get over it.

18:12.679 --> 18:13.758
Good night.

18:13.846 --> 18:16.554
Mom.

18:22.176 --> 18:23.383
Fuck.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.840
What did I just say, Berthe?

18:25.001 --> 18:26.176
I beg of you, leave me alone.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.434
I beg of you,
leave me alone.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.333
What did I just say, Berthe?

18:32.875 --> 18:35.291
I beg of you,
leave me alone.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.546
Please pick up,
please pick up, please pick up.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.215
- Hello?
- Mom?

18:56.387 --> 18:57.550
<i>Yes?</i>

18:57.637 --> 18:59.606
Hi. Um...

18:59.842 --> 19:02.132
I just...
I just wanted to let you know

19:02.220 --> 19:03.924
that, the more I think
about your note,

19:04.011 --> 19:06.083
the more I realize that, um,

19:06.171 --> 19:08.542
it-it's absolutely
the stronger choice.

19:08.652 --> 19:10.504
You were...
you were completely right.

19:11.488 --> 19:13.872
And I'm really sorry
about what I said to you.

19:15.920 --> 19:16.959
Mom?

19:17.153 --> 19:18.356
I'm here.

19:19.122 --> 19:20.809
Um...

19:21.200 --> 19:23.697
are you still coming
to watch Eddie tomorrow?

19:24.075 --> 19:26.122
Of course. I can't wait.

19:26.470 --> 19:27.543
Okay, thank...

19:28.606 --> 19:30.067
Thank you, Mom.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.990
Hey. What's up?

20:05.079 --> 20:07.326
Hey. Um, could you
watch him for me?

20:07.585 --> 20:09.706
My mom was supposed to do it,
but she just canceled.

20:09.794 --> 20:11.508
She has... says she has
the flu or something.

20:11.595 --> 20:13.629
Oh, I'd love to,
but I have a work thing.

20:13.881 --> 20:16.215
Okay. Um, um,
I'm kind of desperate.

20:16.303 --> 20:18.300
Um, I just got this part
in this movie

20:18.387 --> 20:19.857
and it's a really big deal,
and I don't think

20:19.944 --> 20:21.704
I'm gonna get an opportunity
like this again.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.402
Well, then you should
hire a babysitter,

20:23.489 --> 20:25.095
like I've been suggesting.

20:26.915 --> 20:29.911
Please, Helen,
just this once, I...

20:30.099 --> 20:31.887
can you reschedule your meeting
or something?

20:31.975 --> 20:33.472
I-I promise,
I will do

20:33.560 --> 20:34.807
whatever I can
to make it up to you.

20:34.894 --> 20:36.140
I-I really need your help.

20:36.248 --> 20:37.895
- I don't...
- Sierra,

20:37.983 --> 20:40.272
you brought a child
into this world.

20:41.077 --> 20:42.534
Figure it out.

20:48.804 --> 20:50.258
Okay.

20:50.778 --> 20:52.466
Sierra, wait.

20:53.162 --> 20:54.538
Hey.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.122
I heard
the whole conversation.

20:58.210 --> 21:02.415
And... I'd be happy
to help babysit.

21:03.510 --> 21:04.878
Y-You would?

21:05.039 --> 21:06.789
Yeah.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.634
What did I just say, Berthe?

21:12.057 --> 21:14.970
I beg of you, leave me alone.

21:15.198 --> 21:17.031
Uh, let's cut, please.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.049
Okay.

21:22.401 --> 21:23.883
And action.

21:24.237 --> 21:27.057
Darling, let go of my apron.

21:27.159 --> 21:30.636
Mummy does not want to play.
I've asked you nicely.

21:32.136 --> 21:33.731
I'm not feeling well.

21:33.970 --> 21:35.888
Okay, uh, can we cut?

21:37.605 --> 21:39.138
Let's, um...

21:39.720 --> 21:40.966
Let's go again.

21:41.778 --> 21:42.955
Uh, sure.

21:46.587 --> 21:48.584
And...

21:49.013 --> 21:50.552
And action.

21:50.887 --> 21:54.966
Did I not say
leave me alone, child?

21:55.221 --> 21:58.182
Leave me alone!

21:58.397 --> 21:59.674
And cut.

22:06.912 --> 22:08.594
We have just enough time
for one more shot, and that's it.

22:08.681 --> 22:10.401
For one more shot.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.190
I'm thinking
we should move on.

22:20.674 --> 22:21.924
N...

22:22.087 --> 22:23.911
Maybe-maybe just give me
some adjustments. I mean, I...

22:23.998 --> 22:25.743
Lillian, we need
her coverage.

22:25.831 --> 22:27.303
She's got a curfew.

22:30.214 --> 22:31.627
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:31.715 --> 22:34.237
Leif, um...

22:34.996 --> 22:36.870
let me do this
one more time. Okay?

22:37.136 --> 22:38.784
I know that you don't
have what you need,

22:38.872 --> 22:40.510
so just-just one more take?

22:40.745 --> 22:41.845
Please?

22:46.816 --> 22:49.370
- Once more.
- Okay, thanks.

22:53.657 --> 22:56.132
And whenever you're ready.

22:56.220 --> 22:58.213
Just, okay, one-one second.

23:02.011 --> 23:03.362
You are enough.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.716
And action.

23:06.026 --> 23:07.633
Darling, let go of my apron.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.245
I've asked you nicely.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.585
Mummy does not want to play.

23:11.993 --> 23:13.072
I'm not feeling well.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.377
You have enough toys
littered about.

23:17.261 --> 23:19.174
What did I just say, Berthe?

23:19.276 --> 23:21.902
I beg of you, leave me alone.

23:24.399 --> 23:27.020
Did I not say leave me alone?

23:27.588 --> 23:29.508
Leave me alone, child.

23:29.595 --> 23:32.091
I-I'm sorry.

23:32.325 --> 23:34.508
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:34.684 --> 23:36.434
Did you cut yourself?

23:36.878 --> 23:39.459
We'll bandage
that up for you.

23:39.547 --> 23:41.876
But let that be
a lesson to you.

23:42.559 --> 23:44.528
You're far
too persistent.

23:50.951 --> 23:54.965
So very strange
how ugly you are.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.723
And cut.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.507
That's what I'm looking for.

24:02.595 --> 24:03.592
Okay.

24:03.679 --> 24:05.067
Bravo.

24:05.303 --> 24:07.231
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.

Um, I have
a confession to make.

25:01.470 --> 25:04.020
I only called you in
to audition because

25:04.108 --> 25:08.114
I had a massive crush on
your mother when I was a kid.

25:08.284 --> 25:09.613
Hmm.

25:09.755 --> 25:12.960
I mean, posters,
memorabilia.

25:13.181 --> 25:17.692
I needed, like, a whole Dewey
decimal system to keep track.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.036
Between you and me,
I'd always hoped

25:21.193 --> 25:24.940
the rumors of that
blue movie were true.

25:25.269 --> 25:27.765
- They're not, by the way.
- Hmm.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.528
But you knew that.

25:31.929 --> 25:33.679
Truth is...

25:35.022 --> 25:38.997
..not only are you prettier
than she ever was...

25:42.162 --> 25:45.159
..you are ten times
the actress.

It's 2 a.m.

Jesus.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.609
Stacey's 12 years old.

27:06.053 --> 27:07.899
She never babysat before.

27:09.188 --> 27:11.492
I'm s... I'm sorry.

27:12.496 --> 27:15.245

Hey, buddy.

27:43.839 --> 27:46.344
It's okay. Here we go.

27:47.078 --> 27:48.845
It's okay.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.383
Shh. Shh.

28:03.637 --> 28:06.024
Shh. Shh.

28:10.554 --> 28:12.922
No, no. No.

28:13.010 --> 28:16.266
Shh. Shh!

28:22.584 --> 28:24.953
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

28:25.166 --> 28:27.371
Please, please. Shh.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.768
Please.

28:34.136 --> 28:37.102
Okay, okay.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.353
Okay.

28:53.672 --> 28:56.055
Okay. It's okay.

28:58.619 --> 29:00.450
Okay.

29:00.929 --> 29:02.508
Here we go.

29:02.596 --> 29:05.891
There we go.
There we go.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.328
Hey, little guy.

29:08.428 --> 29:10.805
Hey, listen to me.

29:10.893 --> 29:13.806
How 'bout we just go
on a quick...

29:14.151 --> 29:17.445
just a little drive
around the block. Okay?

29:19.227 --> 29:23.594
And maybe that'll help you
to relax a little bit. Yeah?

29:23.719 --> 29:25.164
What do you say?

29:25.252 --> 29:28.453
I know. Okay.
I know, I know. Okay.

29:30.762 --> 29:32.734
Just a quick drive, okay?

29:34.186 --> 29:35.810
It's time to go
to sleep now, buddy.

29:45.679 --> 29:48.524
Hey, Eddie,

29:48.738 --> 29:52.758
it's just you and me now,
buddy, okay?

29:52.914 --> 29:54.717
Just you and me
'cause we're all we've got.

29:54.804 --> 29:56.174
That's okay.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.550
That's good. That's a lot.

29:58.637 --> 29:59.842
Hey, hey.

29:59.929 --> 30:01.578
Every day

30:01.762 --> 30:03.008
and in every way,

30:03.096 --> 30:05.093
today I will remember my breath.

30:05.282 --> 30:06.561
You hear that?

30:06.649 --> 30:07.842
Breathe, buddy.

30:07.929 --> 30:10.929
Every day and in every way...

30:12.553 --> 30:14.258
Hey, hey, listen to Mommy, huh?

30:14.345 --> 30:16.049
Listen to me.

30:16.136 --> 30:17.758
Listen to me, buddy.

30:17.845 --> 30:18.923
What do you need?

30:19.032 --> 30:21.258
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

30:21.345 --> 30:23.145
What do you need, bud?
You got to help me out.

32:23.321 --> 32:24.992
What time is it?

32:25.917 --> 32:28.539
Uh, just after nine.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.149
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you wake me up?

32:31.297 --> 32:32.961
I have to be
at Carolina's at ten.

32:33.049 --> 32:35.248
Oh, you can be late.
No problem.

32:35.336 --> 32:37.749
- Just tell her you're with me.
- Okay.

32:37.929 --> 32:40.180
You know,
this is my job.

32:40.572 --> 32:42.930
Would you do that
on your movie set?

32:43.470 --> 32:45.125
Truth?

32:45.256 --> 32:47.044
No.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch it.

32:48.955 --> 32:50.952
- I'm working, too, just now.
- Oh, really?

32:51.040 --> 32:53.036
Yes. We have to do
endless reshoots

32:53.124 --> 32:56.412
due to your ex-husband's
subpar writing.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.141
Oh, well,
don't let me interrupt you.

32:58.388 --> 32:59.907
Well, that's
a little late.

33:01.266 --> 33:04.133
The deed is done,
and now I really feel

33:04.220 --> 33:06.508
- you owe me something in return.
- Mm-hmm.

33:11.860 --> 33:13.653
Ow! Fuck!

33:14.012 --> 33:16.050
Wha...

33:16.903 --> 33:18.417
What the fuck was that for?

33:18.505 --> 33:20.008
I told you
I have to go.

33:20.095 --> 33:21.592
I'm a very respected actor,
you know.

33:21.679 --> 33:22.856
Mm-hmm.

33:22.944 --> 33:25.997
Some might even use the term
"international movie star."

33:26.106 --> 33:28.331
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't mean to sound arrogant,

33:28.419 --> 33:30.131
but there are quite a lot
of women out there

33:30.218 --> 33:31.823
that would not kick me
out of bed.

33:31.911 --> 33:34.356
Well, it's too bad
none of 'em are here now.

33:41.189 --> 33:42.435
Hey, I'm sorry.

33:42.544 --> 33:44.300
I just threw that
in there. I-I...

33:44.505 --> 33:46.731
I just didn't know
what to do with it.

33:52.095 --> 33:53.599
Are you okay?

33:58.130 --> 34:00.008
Yeah, I'm just,
I'm really sorry.

34:00.095 --> 34:03.258
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about Noah,
and I'm sorry about last night,

34:03.345 --> 34:04.842
and it's just so...

34:05.356 --> 34:07.112
Helen, your ex-husband
is a child.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.427
That's not your fault.

34:08.536 --> 34:11.507
I would be crazy
to hold that against you.

34:11.922 --> 34:13.547
Give me that.

34:14.943 --> 34:16.427
Get rid of it.

34:30.741 --> 34:32.356
What was that for?

34:35.231 --> 34:37.786
I just didn't think
men like you existed.

34:38.591 --> 34:40.286
Except in the movies.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.177
I love you.

34:59.251 --> 35:01.177
You do?

35:01.702 --> 35:03.497
Yeah. I do.

35:07.890 --> 35:09.594
Oh, my God.

35:09.682 --> 35:10.885
Oh, my God.

35:10.973 --> 35:14.034
- So, do you like it?
- Are you kidding me?

35:14.122 --> 35:15.755
- You're a genius.
- Oh.

35:15.843 --> 35:17.067
Thank you.

35:17.233 --> 35:19.825
I'm the one that
should be thanking you.

35:19.950 --> 35:22.177
Ah. God.

35:22.271 --> 35:23.396
Champagne?

35:23.484 --> 35:24.692
Sure.

35:24.780 --> 35:27.716
You know, when-when Barry told
me that Sasha was, uh...

35:27.905 --> 35:29.901
had a girlfriend
who was a designer,

35:29.989 --> 35:31.802
I was like,
"Oh, yeah, of course he does."

35:32.692 --> 35:35.300
Then you show up,
and you're so...

35:35.856 --> 35:37.008
normal.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.474
God, I don't meet
people like you.

35:39.692 --> 35:42.355
Not out here anyway.
Not in this business.

35:42.771 --> 35:45.161
Yeah, I know.
It's really tough out here.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.677
I don't have any friends.

35:47.929 --> 35:50.169
Oh. Sign me up.

35:51.804 --> 35:53.786
Ah. Gosh.

35:54.711 --> 35:57.113
I'm so nervous about
tonight.

35:57.571 --> 35:59.162
I just think people
are gonna be judging us

35:59.249 --> 36:00.911
the second
they walk in the door.

36:02.152 --> 36:04.497
Barry hasn't had a hit in,
like, two decades.

36:04.849 --> 36:06.138
Just, I mean,
I just, I thought

36:06.226 --> 36:08.139
I was just gonna let
this birthday come and go,

36:08.342 --> 36:11.511
but... he's turning 60.

36:11.599 --> 36:13.521
It's kind of
a big deal.

36:13.609 --> 36:15.132
He deserves a party.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.206
Well, you're throwing him
a beautiful party.

36:17.294 --> 36:18.489
I'm sure he'll be very happy.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.317
Come sit down.

36:23.613 --> 36:27.255
It's so great that Sasha
is doing Barry's movie.

36:27.679 --> 36:29.698
I think sometimes
people go through

36:29.786 --> 36:31.872
these periods
of self-doubt,

36:31.960 --> 36:33.665
and they...

36:33.782 --> 36:37.208
they just need someone
to believe in them.

36:38.255 --> 36:41.153
Course, that's the time
that nobody does.

36:41.939 --> 36:43.729
To new friends and
new beginnings.

36:43.817 --> 36:45.294
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:48.547 --> 36:50.923
God, okay, let's talk about
what you're gonna wear tonight.

36:51.011 --> 36:52.146
Me?

36:52.720 --> 36:54.341
I-I-I have this...

36:54.429 --> 36:58.708
this vintage Halston
one-shoulder jumpsuit

36:58.929 --> 37:02.021
that would be, like,
so incredible on you.

37:02.114 --> 37:04.856
I don't think anybody's gonna be
paying much attention to me.

37:05.497 --> 37:08.911
You... Did he find
you under a rock?

37:09.101 --> 37:11.194
This is basically
your debut.

37:11.282 --> 37:12.695
As what?

37:12.845 --> 37:15.302
Sasha Mann's girlfriend.

37:19.263 --> 37:21.880
Oh, I wasn't
expecting anyone.

37:28.935 --> 37:30.817
That's my ex-husband.

37:36.511 --> 37:38.302
What are you doing here?

37:38.887 --> 37:41.174
I'm sorry to ambush
you like this, I...

37:41.317 --> 37:42.764
but y-you're not
picking up your phone.

37:42.851 --> 37:44.514
Whitney said you'd
be here, and...

37:44.970 --> 37:46.966
I really need to talk to you
about last night. - No, no, no, no.

37:47.053 --> 37:48.989
I'm not doing that,
not here, not now.

37:49.216 --> 37:51.300
I'm working.
This is really important to me.

37:51.387 --> 37:52.792
Please don't ruin this, too.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.668
Just please, please, just...
just let me explain, okay?

37:55.826 --> 37:58.531
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about the bra.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.531
I was desperate, I...

38:01.157 --> 38:02.740
I want you back.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.861
I love you.

38:09.362 --> 38:10.506
Please say something.

38:10.594 --> 38:11.881
I don't know... I don't...

38:12.022 --> 38:13.980
I don't know
what you want me to say.

38:15.949 --> 38:17.690
Well, that you love me, too.

38:19.762 --> 38:22.049
What in God's name w...
makes you think

38:22.136 --> 38:23.966
I would say that right now?

38:24.053 --> 38:26.011
Well, maybe 'cause
it's the truth.

38:28.155 --> 38:31.221
Don't you think
we owe it to ourselves

38:31.402 --> 38:32.901
to try again?

38:34.457 --> 38:36.286
We have four children.

38:37.073 --> 38:38.258
What if we got it
all wrong?

38:38.345 --> 38:40.065
What if, what if
we're meant to be together?

38:44.232 --> 38:45.813
Come on, don't you feel
anything for me anymore?

38:45.900 --> 38:48.580
If I feel anything for you,
I feel sorry for you.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.992
Because you've
managed to turn 50

38:51.080 --> 38:53.091
and not know how to be an adult.

38:53.463 --> 38:55.141
Oh, and Sasha Mann does?

38:55.229 --> 38:57.216
Yeah, I think so.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.694
Come on, Helen,
he's... he's playing me.

39:00.782 --> 39:02.365
He's pretending to be me.

39:03.084 --> 39:05.549
It's so obvious.
You're in love with me.

39:05.637 --> 39:08.369
He's you, but he's better.

39:09.026 --> 39:10.807
And please,
just admit to yourself

39:10.924 --> 39:13.592
the only reason you want me
right now is because he does.

39:13.679 --> 39:15.758
No. As usual, you're not
listening to what I'm saying.

39:15.845 --> 39:18.026
I came here to tell you
I love you.

39:18.308 --> 39:20.679
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

39:20.969 --> 39:22.727
And I know I've made
some mistakes,

39:23.368 --> 39:25.864
but the only important thing
is that I love you.

39:26.014 --> 39:27.514
I've always loved you.

39:36.024 --> 39:38.758
I-I ac-actually don't know
what that word means to you.

39:39.548 --> 39:41.415
Well, it means
I deserve a second chance.

39:41.510 --> 39:43.462
You had a second chance.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.345
Many times,
and you fucked them all up.

39:46.553 --> 39:49.126
And I would be a fucking idiot
to go back there.

39:51.628 --> 39:55.071
- Helen...
- Noah, I don't love you anymore.

39:57.065 --> 39:58.720
I don't want your love.

39:59.006 --> 40:02.485
It terrifies me, and it's
caused me nothing but pain.

40:03.910 --> 40:05.345
So I'm done.

40:15.529 --> 40:16.988
Okay.

40:23.501 --> 40:25.164
Hey.

40:25.407 --> 40:26.407
Hey.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.433
What's up?

40:30.521 --> 40:33.693
I ran out of coffee.
And I'm so tired.

40:33.795 --> 40:35.341
Glad we had some.

40:35.498 --> 40:38.521
Hey, um,
can you watch him tonight?

40:38.609 --> 40:42.459
Um, I wish I could,
but I, uh, have an event.

40:43.342 --> 40:44.393
Please?

40:44.636 --> 40:47.382
I'm sorry. I-I mean,
I-I... really, but I just,

40:47.470 --> 40:49.662
I have to, I have to go
to this party.

40:51.702 --> 40:54.397
I mean, you promised Vik

40:54.485 --> 40:56.443
that you would help me
take care of him.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.607
Please, Helen,
just ditch the party.

41:01.759 --> 41:05.029
I'm... I've been looking after
him by myself for four months,

41:05.117 --> 41:07.285
and it's exhausting;
like, I need a break.

41:07.373 --> 41:08.966
When do I get a goddamn break?

41:09.115 --> 41:10.787
In about 18 years.

41:13.624 --> 41:16.092
Right. Okay. Cool.

41:17.628 --> 41:20.215
Can I at least take this
with me? I can't find mine.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.763
Uh...

41:23.355 --> 41:26.685
Maybe don't smoke pot
around the baby.

41:27.615 --> 41:28.873
Okay.

41:29.009 --> 41:30.964
Thanks for the advice,
Super Mom.

41:31.052 --> 41:32.842
Oh, come on. Excuse me?

41:33.011 --> 41:35.383
Sorry. It's cool.

41:35.470 --> 41:37.305
Just... I'm-I'm just
really tired.

41:37.393 --> 41:39.060
Have fun at your party.

41:49.686 --> 41:50.817
Helen?

41:50.905 --> 41:52.477
Yeah?

41:54.346 --> 41:55.384
Priya.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.468
I was hoping I'd find you home.

41:57.774 --> 41:59.687
I brought you a gift.

42:00.391 --> 42:01.804
What for?

42:03.692 --> 42:05.025
Open it.

42:18.383 --> 42:19.966
What is it?

42:20.196 --> 42:21.883
It's a sari.

42:22.266 --> 42:25.680
White is the color of mourning.

42:39.413 --> 42:42.204
Uh, it's very beautiful,
but white isn't really my color.

42:47.175 --> 42:48.879
- Will you excuse me?
- Mm-hmm.

42:49.530 --> 42:50.675
Hi.

42:51.124 --> 42:53.174
Oh, great. Okay.

42:53.733 --> 42:55.178
I'll see you in a little bit.

42:57.095 --> 42:59.225
I-I love you, too.

43:00.470 --> 43:01.952
Who was that?

43:02.327 --> 43:05.014
Uh, that was, uh, my boyfriend.

43:07.334 --> 43:08.702
Boyfriend?

43:08.891 --> 43:10.086
Priya, please don't.

43:10.174 --> 43:13.985
Vikram has not even been gone
for a few months.

43:14.935 --> 43:19.140
Where I come from, widows
wear white for a whole year.

43:19.228 --> 43:21.141
It's different in this country.
We wear black.

43:21.229 --> 43:23.446
And fortunately,
half of my wardrobe is...

43:24.979 --> 43:26.059
Actually,

43:26.147 --> 43:27.282
I'm running really late.

43:27.370 --> 43:29.579
Is there, um... is there
anything else you wanted to...

43:29.667 --> 43:31.206
As a matter of fact,
yes, there is.

43:31.294 --> 43:33.743
Okay, great.
I will call you from the car.

43:34.929 --> 43:36.548
You can let yourself out.

43:45.149 --> 43:47.665
Excuse me. Can I help you?

43:49.852 --> 43:51.800
- Um...
- You must be Helen.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.423
I'm Christianna.

43:53.535 --> 43:55.087
So nice to meet you.

43:56.741 --> 43:58.657
I'm sorry, should I know you?

44:01.303 --> 44:03.009
I'm his daughter.

44:06.009 --> 44:07.595
Oh.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.516
Hey, Helen.

44:12.657 --> 44:14.889
Carolina sent over some stuff
for you to wear tonight,

44:14.984 --> 44:18.024
but she wasn't sure if
you've got shoes to go with it.

44:22.766 --> 44:24.852
I tried ringing the bell.

44:25.057 --> 44:26.429
You didn't answer.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.173
No. I was in the sauna.

44:29.261 --> 44:31.300
- I didn't hear it.
- I'm sure.

44:31.387 --> 44:34.842
Helen, you can't just let people
into my house like this.

44:34.929 --> 44:36.174
- I thought we talked about that.
- Well, no, she told me

44:36.261 --> 44:37.352
she was your daughter.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.395
- Well, that's hardly accurate, is it?
- No.

44:39.585 --> 44:41.842
Not now that it's
inconvenient for you.

44:41.930 --> 44:43.485
Christianna,
what do you want?

44:43.589 --> 44:46.204
I just want to spend time
with you, Dad.

44:46.387 --> 44:47.301
I'm sorry.

44:47.388 --> 44:49.680
Um, I-I-I don't
understand what's...

44:49.768 --> 44:51.348
She was my
fiancÃ©e's daughter.

44:51.436 --> 44:52.890
Still am.

44:53.151 --> 44:55.356
She's dead, remember? Not me.

44:55.444 --> 44:57.524
Should I make some coffee
or something?

44:57.612 --> 44:58.733
No, thank you, Helen.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.662
That's very nice
of you to offer,

45:00.804 --> 45:01.966
but I'm all right.

45:03.315 --> 45:04.466
How do you know my name?

45:04.553 --> 45:06.375
She's been stalking you,
most likely.

45:06.463 --> 45:08.758
I picked up
a copy of Us Weekly,

45:08.846 --> 45:09.963
Sasha.

45:10.136 --> 45:14.135
At the airport,
on my way back from rehab.

45:14.896 --> 45:16.078
Rehab. Right.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.133
Okay, I think
I'm just gonna...

45:17.221 --> 45:18.401
No, please stay.

45:18.489 --> 45:20.736
Christianna won't
be here very long.

45:20.824 --> 45:21.924
How much?

45:22.012 --> 45:22.971
I don't want money.

45:23.059 --> 45:25.434
Okay, then what do you want?

45:27.227 --> 45:29.319
You said that if I ever needed

45:29.407 --> 45:31.330
a place to stay,
I could stay here.

45:31.418 --> 45:34.588
Christianna, that was
before you stole all my art

45:34.744 --> 45:35.758
and pawned it.

45:35.845 --> 45:37.588
It belonged to my mother!

45:37.738 --> 45:39.994
- You gave it to her.
- How much?!

45:47.041 --> 45:48.673
$25,000.

45:48.761 --> 45:50.546
That's it? I'm getting off
cheap this time.

45:50.634 --> 45:52.095
Hmm?

46:08.216 --> 46:09.898
You're a real prince.

46:09.986 --> 46:11.940
- Do you want me to call you a car?
- No.

46:12.256 --> 46:14.248
I wouldn't want
to put you out.

46:20.512 --> 46:21.857
Fuck!

46:27.778 --> 46:29.099
I need a drink.

46:31.194 --> 46:34.615
She does this
every six months or so.

46:34.713 --> 46:37.626
Shows up, pretends
she wants a...

46:37.909 --> 46:39.827
relationship.

46:42.553 --> 46:44.129
Well, she just
got out of rehab.

46:44.217 --> 46:45.383
Maybe she just
needs a place

46:45.470 --> 46:47.263
to stay till she gets
back on her feet.

46:47.351 --> 46:49.514
Helen, she was not in rehab.

46:49.959 --> 46:51.638
She was in Bali.

46:53.357 --> 46:54.929
How do you know?

46:57.045 --> 46:58.787
I had her followed.

47:04.646 --> 47:05.685
By who?

47:05.790 --> 47:07.482
Some of my security detail.

47:07.570 --> 47:10.928
And... well, I had no choice.

47:12.693 --> 47:14.300
She's extorting me for money.

47:14.387 --> 47:15.929
Lis-Listen.

47:18.449 --> 47:21.256
I don't expect you to understand
this, 'cause you're different,

47:22.345 --> 47:24.357
but most people...

47:25.700 --> 47:27.299
they use me.

47:27.881 --> 47:30.341
They pretend they care,
and then I let them close,

47:30.428 --> 47:33.425
and then they just take
what they can get, right?

47:33.512 --> 47:35.842
And it doesn't matter
if they're family.

47:37.712 --> 47:40.873
Sometimes family is
the fucking worst.

47:54.511 --> 47:55.998
I'm sorry.

47:58.551 --> 47:59.974
Yeah.

48:03.143 --> 48:05.107
I'm really sorry, Sasha.

48:14.628 --> 48:15.974
Mm.

48:18.392 --> 48:20.740
Oh, shit.
It's Vik's mom.

48:20.962 --> 48:22.365
I forgot to call her back.

48:22.453 --> 48:24.607
Okay, take it.
It's fine.

48:26.919 --> 48:29.666
Hey, Priya. Sorry. I didn't
have any reception on the...

48:29.754 --> 48:31.240
<i>Helen, I had to come</i>

48:31.328 --> 48:33.623
<i>all the way to your house
to ask for a favor.</i>

48:33.762 --> 48:35.623
<i>My brother is in town.</i>

48:35.798 --> 48:37.779
His plane got rerouted
from Mumbai,

48:37.867 --> 48:40.990
and he's got an unexpected
24-hour layover.

48:41.683 --> 48:43.387
I'd like for him to meet Eddie.

48:43.717 --> 48:45.592
You should call Sierra.

48:47.637 --> 48:49.107
Priya?

48:49.604 --> 48:52.240
All my brother knows is
that Vikram was married

48:52.345 --> 48:53.800
to a woman named Helen.

48:53.887 --> 48:56.974
Can you bring the baby
over instead?

49:01.912 --> 49:04.435
Do you want your brother
to think the baby is mine?

49:04.531 --> 49:06.918
<i>Our family is
very conservative.</i>

49:07.022 --> 49:10.069
<i>What happened is not something
they'd understand.</i>

49:10.194 --> 49:12.065
What? They don't fuck
around in Mumbai?

49:12.261 --> 49:13.849
That was not very nice.

49:13.937 --> 49:17.336
<i>Helen, I haven't seen
my brother in years.</i>

49:17.640 --> 49:20.383
<i>Can you just pretend
for one night?</i>

49:22.303 --> 49:23.570
What am I supposed to say?

49:23.727 --> 49:25.852
You are supposed to say no.

49:27.488 --> 49:29.192
This is what I mean.

49:29.656 --> 49:30.966
You have to set
your boundaries.

49:31.133 --> 49:33.425
Otherwise, people will just
keep walking all over you.

49:33.539 --> 49:35.699
<i>Helen? Hello?</i>

49:42.235 --> 49:43.235
Um...

49:45.274 --> 49:47.437
I'm sorry, Priya.
I can't, not tonight.

49:47.587 --> 49:50.083
Helen, please, just this once?

49:50.453 --> 49:52.424
When have I ever asked
for anything?

49:52.512 --> 49:54.425
Priya, I said no.

49:54.512 --> 49:57.336
Please respect that.
Good night.

49:59.359 --> 50:00.508
How does that feel?

50:00.694 --> 50:02.231
Feels great, right?

50:02.633 --> 50:04.345
Mm-hmm.

50:05.511 --> 50:07.414
Listen, we have
to get dressed.

50:07.909 --> 50:10.375
Or we'll be late. Hmm?

50:50.930 --> 50:52.222
Thank you.

50:57.512 --> 50:58.720
- Hey.
- Hi.

50:58.808 --> 51:00.829
- You good?
- Yeah. It's just work.

51:00.917 --> 51:02.252
You look stunning.

51:02.345 --> 51:03.842
I feel a little ridiculous.

51:03.929 --> 51:07.675
I feel we should find a room
with a door that locks.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.155
Helen Solloway?

51:10.243 --> 51:11.532
Is that you?

51:12.727 --> 51:14.028
Hi.

51:14.704 --> 51:16.261
Eden.

51:17.379 --> 51:20.360
Eden Ellery.
I-I was Noah's publicist.

51:20.448 --> 51:22.202
We met years ago at Williams.

51:22.290 --> 51:24.383
Oh, Eden, yes.

51:24.470 --> 51:26.305
Of course. Hi.
How are you?

51:26.475 --> 51:30.280
I'm good. I, uh... I moved
out west, had a couple kids.

51:30.368 --> 51:31.796
Things are great, actually.

51:31.884 --> 51:34.633
Oh. Well, what are
you doing, uh, here?

51:34.805 --> 51:36.550
Oh, God. Carolina's
an old friend of my sister's.

51:36.637 --> 51:37.800
- You're kidding.
- No.

51:37.887 --> 51:39.079
And here we were,
thinking

51:39.167 --> 51:41.212
that we didn't have
any friends in common.

51:44.019 --> 51:45.974
Uh, Eden, this is my boyfriend.

51:46.178 --> 51:47.454
Oh, you...

51:48.486 --> 51:50.071
- Sasha.
- Wow.

51:50.391 --> 51:51.915
H... Yeah. Hi.

51:52.003 --> 51:54.462
- Hi.
- Seriously?

51:54.929 --> 51:57.813
Wow. Way to glow up, Helen.

51:59.636 --> 52:01.215
God, I'm really glad
that you finally

52:01.303 --> 52:03.212
got away from Noah Solloway.

52:03.415 --> 52:04.860
What a creep.
Am I right?

52:04.948 --> 52:06.704
Yeah, kind of a creep.

52:06.798 --> 52:10.141
I have to say I am a huge fan
of yours, Mr. Mann.

52:10.515 --> 52:12.530
I have my own firm now,
and we've actually

52:12.618 --> 52:14.174
expanded into
representing talent,

52:14.261 --> 52:17.663
so, if you ever feel
like making a switch,

52:17.751 --> 52:19.712
- please give me a call.
- Thank you.

52:19.807 --> 52:21.650
I like to think I did
a pretty good job for Noah,

52:21.737 --> 52:24.691
and let me tell you,
it was not easy.

52:24.846 --> 52:26.852
No. You must be
very talented.

52:27.705 --> 52:29.813
- I'll keep you in mind.
- Thank you.

52:30.423 --> 52:33.174
Helen, it is...
it is so good to see you.

52:33.399 --> 52:36.360
I'd love to grab a drink now
that we're both on this coast.

52:36.569 --> 52:38.735
- Oh. Sure.
- Okay.

52:38.845 --> 52:41.717
My number's on the card,
so, seriously, give me a call.

52:41.804 --> 52:43.235
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:43.423 --> 52:44.675
Pleasure meeting you.

52:44.762 --> 52:46.470
- Bye.
- Bye.

52:48.845 --> 52:50.289
That was weird.

52:50.553 --> 52:52.047
Small world.

52:53.177 --> 52:55.382
I think they were
sleeping together.

52:55.664 --> 52:56.842
Her and Noah?

52:56.929 --> 52:59.157
- Yeah.
- When?

52:59.653 --> 53:01.110
On his book tour.

53:05.563 --> 53:07.079
Didn't seem to end too well.

53:07.167 --> 53:08.688
No, I guess not.

53:10.512 --> 53:11.977
Oh.

53:12.887 --> 53:14.618
Oh, fuck. I need to take this.

53:14.766 --> 53:15.966
Will you be all right
for a second?

53:16.053 --> 53:17.466
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

53:17.657 --> 53:18.907
Yes?

53:29.679 --> 53:31.592
Everything is going so well.

53:31.679 --> 53:33.274
- Good. Great.
- Yeah.

53:33.953 --> 53:35.311
Look at Barry.

53:35.399 --> 53:38.680
He's so happy.
He's like a pig in shit.

53:39.350 --> 53:42.471
- Oh, can I make a confession?
- Sure.

53:42.559 --> 53:45.155
Like, a few months ago,
we-we... we were

53:45.243 --> 53:47.215
about to put this house
on the market.

53:47.500 --> 53:50.675
Yeah, we-we...
He wasn't working at all.

53:51.102 --> 53:53.444
He was about to enter
the-the third year

53:53.532 --> 53:55.985
of this
profound depression.

53:56.310 --> 53:58.844
We never left the house.
We never saw anyone.

53:58.954 --> 54:01.991
I was gonna... I was gonna take
the girls and go to my mother's.

54:02.079 --> 54:05.508
But for some reason,
I just decided to stick it out.

54:05.595 --> 54:08.758
And then, when I read the
script, I just knew he was onto

54:08.845 --> 54:10.063
something special.

54:11.997 --> 54:14.083
And when Sasha decided
to do it, they just...

54:14.171 --> 54:16.380
they couldn't green-light it
fast enough.

54:16.468 --> 54:17.755
- Carolina! Hey.
- Oh!

54:17.843 --> 54:19.507
We were just
talking about you.

54:19.595 --> 54:21.133
- How are you?
- Oh. Ooh.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.659
- You look amazing.
- Oh, thank you.

54:22.747 --> 54:25.661
- What's up?
- The Maze 3 is a go.

54:25.825 --> 54:27.307
Producers just called.

54:27.395 --> 54:28.675
That's... good?

54:28.762 --> 54:30.807
That's amazing.
Script is fantastic.

54:30.895 --> 54:32.794
And we start production in...

54:32.882 --> 54:35.711
in Chad, uh, next week.

54:36.630 --> 54:38.300
Uh, wait. What? Wait.

54:38.481 --> 54:40.169
What about Barry's movie?

54:45.929 --> 54:48.145
Oh, shit, Carolina.

54:48.507 --> 54:51.756
Um, that's about to go soon.

54:51.844 --> 54:53.382
Right? Yeah.

54:53.470 --> 54:56.567
Um, there's-there's...
there's no way I can do both.

54:56.655 --> 54:59.411
I'm sorry. - Oh, I don't think
that he would mind pushing it.

54:59.499 --> 55:01.544
No. I wouldn't
ask him to do that, no.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.762
Oh, he's just so excited
to work with you.

55:03.871 --> 55:05.731
I think we could
figure something out.

55:05.819 --> 55:06.825
Listen, I'd love to,

55:06.913 --> 55:09.576
but I have another project lined
up after this one, so, so...

55:09.664 --> 55:10.785
What is it?
Because we, uh...

55:10.873 --> 55:12.924
we-we know
so many people in town.

55:13.012 --> 55:14.342
I'm sure we could
call the producers. They...

55:14.429 --> 55:17.567
I can't make it work.
I'm sorry.

55:17.804 --> 55:20.348
I'll just, uh,
I'll just go talk to him.

55:20.436 --> 55:21.436
No, don't...

55:21.692 --> 55:23.497
Please, he's so happy.

55:27.196 --> 55:29.446
Good to see you.

55:30.473 --> 55:33.575
Um, uh... excuse me.

55:44.661 --> 55:45.789
What's wrong?

55:45.877 --> 55:48.427
I thought you said you were
going to do Barry's movie.

55:48.515 --> 55:50.544
Well, I thought so, too,
but, um,

55:50.632 --> 55:52.575
then something came up, so...

55:55.355 --> 55:58.965
- Didn't you promise him?
- No. I said I would try.

55:59.053 --> 56:01.083
Look, look, this-this
happens in my business

56:01.171 --> 56:03.934
all the time, and he'll get
someone else, and he'll...

56:04.364 --> 56:06.048
probably win an Oscar,

56:06.136 --> 56:08.520
and... he's gonna be fine.

56:09.028 --> 56:10.612
Are we going back
to my place or...

56:10.700 --> 56:12.346
I think I just want to go home.

56:12.434 --> 56:13.924
Helen.

56:14.122 --> 56:15.677
Please don't be like this.

56:15.765 --> 56:18.386
Carolina said Barry needs you
to get the movie made.

56:18.517 --> 56:21.245
A lot of people need me to get
their movies made, and if I made

56:21.333 --> 56:22.518
every single
one of them,

56:22.606 --> 56:23.683
I wouldn't have
the kind of career

56:23.770 --> 56:25.315
that makes me
so valuable to them

56:25.403 --> 56:26.778
in the first place.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.817
But I-I really don't understand

56:28.905 --> 56:30.508
- why you're so upset about this.
- Because I like her,

56:30.595 --> 56:33.008
and I don't have many friends out here,
so...

56:33.095 --> 56:34.717
Carolina is not
your friend.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.008
She only hired you because
I told Barry you needed a job.

56:38.095 --> 56:39.684
He was doing me a favor.

56:42.929 --> 56:44.981
Hey, you don't need her.

56:45.170 --> 56:46.661
You've got me.

56:47.254 --> 56:48.536
I'll be your friend.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.757
Stacey?

57:08.821 --> 57:11.497
Stace? Stacey?

57:19.387 --> 57:20.794
Priya.

57:20.974 --> 57:22.641
You didn't answer
your phone.

57:24.470 --> 57:26.237
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

57:26.325 --> 57:28.008
Um, do you want to come inside?

57:28.095 --> 57:29.185
- I-I can explain.
- I know I'm not

57:29.272 --> 57:30.934
your favorite person, Helen.

57:31.037 --> 57:35.114
But I am a person,
a person who lost her son.

57:38.261 --> 57:40.020
Would you please come inside
and we can talk?

57:40.107 --> 57:42.794
My brother and I have not
spoken in decades.

57:42.882 --> 57:46.661
He cut me off when I married
Abdul because he was a Muslim.

57:46.942 --> 57:49.630
He convinced my parents
to disown me.

57:50.594 --> 57:52.934
They did not come
for my marriage.

57:53.261 --> 57:55.011
They did not know Vikram.

57:56.009 --> 57:59.381
And when he died,
my brother

57:59.778 --> 58:01.645
finally phoned me.

58:02.721 --> 58:04.389
And miraculously...

58:06.391 --> 58:08.559
...he appeared in Los Angeles.

58:09.011 --> 58:10.895
And he wanted to see me.

58:12.670 --> 58:15.145
And he wanted to see
Vikram's widow

58:15.262 --> 58:16.919
and pay his respects.

58:17.007 --> 58:19.091
And he wanted
to see his son.

58:20.368 --> 58:24.606
All I asked is that you not
sully Vikram's legacy

58:24.694 --> 58:29.223
with the one stupid mistake
he made in his entire life.

58:32.387 --> 58:33.950
Um, I'm...

58:35.985 --> 58:38.169
I'm sorry. I am. I...

58:39.958 --> 58:42.341
Vikram said that
you were such a good person,

58:42.429 --> 58:44.473
such a selfless person.

58:44.633 --> 58:46.546
You really had him fooled.

58:46.735 --> 58:48.360
You have everyone fooled.

58:53.317 --> 58:54.778
And you're wrong.

58:55.102 --> 58:57.223
You look lovely in white.
