00:37.622 --> 00:42.036
And now, to watch the Coronation Derby,
comes Her Majesty the Queen.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.082
Her oar, bearing the Royal Standard,

Thanks to the coronation, your sister
is now the most famous woman in the world.

01:18.871 --> 01:19.951
Yes.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.162

I've got a story, chief. It's important.

As long as it's not about the Royal Family,
Bill, I'm all ears.

01:57.994 --> 02:00.110
It is about the Royal Family, chief.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.867
Ah, let me guess, how,
thanks to one beautiful young woman,

02:03.958 --> 02:06.745
one short televised ceremony...

02:06.836 --> 02:08.167
Oh, thank you, Bob.

02:08.254 --> 02:11.667
A tired anachronistic institution
is rejuvenated,

02:11.757 --> 02:15.966
a nation is liberated
from the austerity of rationing and war,

02:16.053 --> 02:18.965
our place as a leading power in the world
is re-established

02:19.056 --> 02:21.843
just when it seemed to be slipping.
What a load of bollocks.

-I shouldn't.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.104
Leaving the Abbey
on the day of the coronation,

02:33.237 --> 02:36.729
I saw her picking a piece of fluff
off a man's uniform.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.780
-Fluff?
-Yes. Fluff.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.575
Jesus,BHL
I thought we did serious reporting here.

02:41.662 --> 02:46.122
This is serious. 'Cause the man in question,
her father's former equerry,

02:46.208 --> 02:49.666
Group Captain Peter Townsend,
is a commoner,

02:49.754 --> 02:53.121
and, wait for it, a divorced commoner.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.715
Historically,
when this lot brush up against divorce,

02:56.802 --> 02:59.760
you end up with either reformation,
or abdication.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.604
Let me write it up, chief.
I've got a feeling about this one.

03:13.778 --> 03:14.813
Based on what?

03:19.158 --> 03:20.773
What are you doing, man?

03:20.868 --> 03:25.908
Picking fluff off a man's jacket,
that's a gesture as intimate as a kiss,

03:25.998 --> 03:29.161
more intimate, since it suggests
the kiss has already happened.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.503
No. I'm sorry, Bill.
I can't hold the front page for a bit of fluff.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.297
Let me write it, chief. Then you decide.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.168
All right.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.386

I am, as Baron says,
fresh from the streets of Cairo,

who happened to get in his way.

-Then why on Earth did we have to dress up?
-She insisted.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.114
She wanted to make it a special occasion.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.867
With him? Isn't that a contradiction in terms?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.159
He's not been a naughty boy, has he?

12:35.756 --> 12:38.418
I know as much as you do.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.017
It will be fine.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.365
Come on.

-We'd like to be left alone now.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.245
Just leave it.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.584
Thank you.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.349
Excuse me.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.156
I asked you here tonight because

13:47.244 --> 13:49.951
there is something
I wanted to discuss with you.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.828
I think you already know that over the years,

13:52.916 --> 13:58.001
with Peter being so much part of our family,
and away from his own so much,

13:58.088 --> 14:00.704
a friendship has developed between us.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.419
And then, ever since
Papa's death hitting me so hard,

14:07.514 --> 14:13.259
and with your accession and coronation
and you being more and more occupied,

14:14.187 --> 14:19.227
Peter has become almost
my sole companion, and I his.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.983
And so, when his divorce came through
in December last year,

14:25.073 --> 14:29.442
I suppose it was only natural that we both
started thinking about what kind of

14:31.580 --> 14:35.368
future we might have together,

14:35.876 --> 14:38.288
and we reached a decision in April, wasn't it?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.960
Just before the coronation...

14:42.591 --> 14:44.422
That, one day,

14:47.387 --> 14:48.672
we wanted to...

14:55.395 --> 14:56.851
Well, you know...

14:57.439 --> 14:59.851
-Marry?
-(LAUGHS) Yes.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.690
ELIZABETH: Goodness.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.106
Well, of course, we're aware
of the complications and issues at stake.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.704
Well, Lilibet, you've known for a while
about Peter and I.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.623
This can't really be a terrible shock to you.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.503
No, not at all.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.836
It's wonderful.

15:31.807 --> 15:35.174
-Is there anything you'd like to ask us?
-Does your wife know?

15:35.268 --> 15:39.011
-No, ex-wife.
-She does. We had a frank conversation.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.643
-There is no animosity.
-Good.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.476
-And the boys?
-They know, and seem very happy.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.818
So,

15:53.036 --> 15:55.072
do I have your permission?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.994
As Sovereign?

16:03.547 --> 16:04.536
Oh.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.090
Well...

16:11.721 --> 16:14.133
Of course, I'll have to take advice

16:15.559 --> 16:20.553
on the hows and wheres,
and all official matters,

16:20.939 --> 16:24.272
but if it's what you desire...

16:27.112 --> 16:29.694
More than anything in the world.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.732
Well, then as your sister,
I'm never going to oppose it.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.989
(GASPS) Thank you. Thank you.

16:39.082 --> 16:42.495
Thank you. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.144
But you didn't think to mention it?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.911
/ don 't like it.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.621
Any of it. For one thing,
it will create the most enormous scandal.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.995
Nor do I believe in them as a couple.
He's too old for her.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.122
And he had some sort of breakdown
during the war.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.041
ELIZABETH: NOW, that's all in the past.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.215
Besides, that's why
he got on with my father so well.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.715
-Not to mention the fact he's dull.
-He's not dull.

17:35.805 --> 17:40.014
Desperately dull. I'm confident
I've met more interesting plants.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.184
Not to mention,
it's a terrible thing to do to you.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.644
VVhy?

17:44.731 --> 17:49.725
Because of the position it puts you in
as a sister and as a Queen.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.778
Has everyone forgotten
the catastrophe that was your uncle already?

17:53.865 --> 17:59.735
-The situation's different.
-One party divorced, the other royal.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.744
Sounds pretty similar to me.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.415
That was 17 years ago.
The world has changed.

18:05.502 --> 18:10.747
The rest of the world has.
Nothing changes in the Court of St. James's.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.082
Besides, we have a son and heir.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.260
There's no realistic prospect
of Margaret becoming Queen.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.848
And one can see the attraction.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.472
In Peter?

18:26.481 --> 18:30.599
Yes. He's a handsome war hero.

18:30.694 --> 18:34.858
-Divorced war hero.
-And blameless in that divorce.

18:34.948 --> 18:39.282
No. There's no such thing
as a blameless party in a divorce.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.281
His wife had an affair with another man.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.829
Because he was always around here,
sniffing around your sister.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.543
-He was looking after my father.
-And sniffing around your sister. (LAUGHS)

18:50.630 --> 18:52.461
Stop it.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.131
Anyway, I thought you liked him.

18:56.052 --> 19:00.967
Oh... Liked him? I mean, I respect him
for what he did in the war, certainly.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.799
He plays bridge well. And he's a good pilot.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.015
-And he's a good influence on Margaret.
-Is he?

19:08.106 --> 19:10.848
If he were really a good influence,
he'd patch things up with his wife,

19:10.942 --> 19:13.183
and leave Margaret well alone.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.206

20:35.693 --> 20:37.900
Yeah, just for a few minutes.

20:40.657 --> 20:44.491
This is notjust inflammatory,
it breaks all the rules.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.566
What rules, sir?

20:45.662 --> 20:49.154
The unspoken rules of deference and respect

20:49.249 --> 20:51.240
shown by the media to the Royal Family.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.870
But surely, those rules changed

20:52.961 --> 20:55.327
the moment
they invited television into the coronation.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.462
That was their right, and a huge concession.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.757
-To what?
-Popular interest.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.550
Their interest also.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.382
Look at their standing now,
it's never been higher.

21:05.473 --> 21:09.466
The question we in the fourth estate
need to be asking ourselves is,

21:09.561 --> 21:13.429
"Do we let ourselves be used,
or do we have our own independent voice?"

21:13.523 --> 21:15.388
Don't get moralistic with me.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.938
If we don't break this story,
do you think nobody else will?

21:19.028 --> 21:22.816
I know there's plenty of others
sniffing around it, sir.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.029
Thank you for letting me know.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.366
Of course, Tommy,
thank you for understanding.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.786
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

21:37.922 --> 21:42.211
I imagine it must be difficult
being dictated to like that by an employee.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.339
-I wasn't dictated to.
-Am I missing something?

21:45.430 --> 21:46.966
You said this editor was telling you

21:47.056 --> 21:49.138
what he was going to print
in your newspaper.

21:49.225 --> 21:53.343
He is.
But I can't keep telling him what to write.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.305
I thought that was the point
of owning a newspaper.

21:58.735 --> 22:01.818

for the kind gesture that it is.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.692

identifying Peter Townsend notjust
as the companion of Princess Margaret,

23:52.557 --> 23:57.267
but as her likely future husband.

23:57.645 --> 24:02.139
We understand
that the paper is to feature a profile

24:02.233 --> 24:04.098
of Group Captain Townsend,

24:04.193 --> 24:09.062
details of his marriage
and subsequent divorce,

24:09.157 --> 24:13.742
along with an editorial
about other notable divorcees

to have been associated
with members of the Royal Family.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.373
Should we deny it all?

Hello, you. Bad time, good time?

25:15.556 --> 25:18.514
(CHUCKLES) Good time. Always.

25:18.601 --> 25:22.344
Look, I've been wracking my brain
about how I can best help you.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.178
Now, you know that the Church of England

25:24.273 --> 25:26.730
doesn't permit the remarriage
of divorced persons

25:26.818 --> 25:29.400
if the husband or wife
of a former marriage is still alive.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.647
Yes.

25:30.738 --> 25:34.481
Well, I was just wondering
if you and Peter had considered Scotland.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.408
-To live?
-No, for the wedding.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.612
Why? Because it would be more low profile?

25:40.998 --> 25:44.365
Well, actually,
I was thinking of legal reasons.

25:44.502 --> 25:47.335
Marriage isn't regarded as a sacrament
in the Church of Scotland.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.038
It is not as binding in the same way as here.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.422
Meaning... Meaning we could
even get married in a church?

25:55.513 --> 25:59.347
Well, I’d have to check, but I think so.

25:59.434 --> 26:02.221

from Mummy about all this.

Yours especially.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.954
But I'm determined to do this for you.

-Your Majesty.

27:18.721 --> 27:22.805
Mummy. This is a surprise.

27:25.228 --> 27:29.597
I am a mother of two daughters
whom I love equally.

27:29.690 --> 27:33.683
It seems that they each have problems
of equal size.

27:35.822 --> 27:39.781
Obviously, we want Margaret to be happy,
to have the man she wants.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.107
Yes.

27:43.037 --> 27:47.827
But we must do everything in our power
to protect you as Queen.

27:47.917 --> 27:51.330
-And as a sister.
-Protect me from what?

27:51.420 --> 27:55.663
I've given Margaret my word,
and I'm determined to support her.

27:55.758 --> 27:59.046
They can marry in Scotland,
where I'm not head of the church.

27:59.136 --> 28:03.630
Your Majesty,
I fear the matter is more intricate.

28:03.933 --> 28:04.968
Let's be quite clear.

28:05.059 --> 28:08.392
If Margaret were to marry Peter,
it would be a scandal.

28:10.022 --> 28:15.267
Don't mistake your current popularity
for long-term security.

28:16.070 --> 28:20.313
Your uncle's affair and abdication
almost destroyed the Monarchy.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.323
This could, too.

28:24.954 --> 28:25.989
Tommy?

28:33.212 --> 28:37.455
Ma'am, what do you know
about the Royal Marriages Act of 1772?

28:38.634 --> 28:40.886
-George II?
-III, ma'am.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.258
He had two younger brothers,
William and Henry.

28:44.348 --> 28:47.010
Both of whom, I'm assuming,
made undesirable marriages.

28:47.101 --> 28:51.845
One to an illegitimate shrew,
the other to a disreputable jade,

28:51.939 --> 28:54.897
which caused an outrage
in parliament and the church.

28:54.984 --> 28:59.398
Now, in response, George III
asked his Prime Minister, Lord North,

28:59.488 --> 29:01.820
to rush through a Royal Marriages Act

29:01.908 --> 29:05.116
to prevent any future willful young prince

29:05.202 --> 29:09.741
or princess from making an ill-advised
or disadvantageous match,

29:10.041 --> 29:12.908
which might threaten
the integrity of the Royal house.

29:13.169 --> 29:17.754
It decrees that until the age of 25,
any member of the Royal Family

29:17.840 --> 29:22.083
must secure
the Sovereign's permission to marry.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.131
-But?
-But not thereafter.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.593
I see.

29:33.522 --> 29:37.185
So, if Margaret were to wait
until after her 25th birthday,

29:37.276 --> 29:41.394
she would be free to make any decision
she likes without your consent.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.567
The important thing is,

29:43.699 --> 29:48.489
it protects your relationship
with both church and government.

29:50.498 --> 29:56.118
Well, I can see the advantages of that.
But what's in it for her?

29:56.212 --> 29:59.955
Mummy, she's only 23.
What does she do in the meantime?

30:01.717 --> 30:04.880
In the meantime, she and Peter wait.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.505
Preferably, in separate countries.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.590
What?

30:10.685 --> 30:13.802
It's the only way to contain the story, ma'am.

Then you would be free to do as you wish.

Is it a posting, or is it a banishment?

31:39.315 --> 31:43.228
It's a posting. I promise.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.316
It's just a way of managing the story,
keeping it off the front pages.

31:48.407 --> 31:52.525
-Not a heartless attempt to split us up?
-No, of course not.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.736
Papa did the same for Philip and me.
He made us wait.

31:54.830 --> 31:59.540
For three months. This is for two years.
Think of it. Two years.

32:07.802 --> 32:10.384
Why did you even dangle Scotland
under my nose?

32:15.017 --> 32:16.223
Sorry.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.450
All right.

32:45.589 --> 32:49.958
If I do this for you, will you promise me
that this banishment...

32:50.052 --> 32:51.041
Posting.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.344
This banishment won't start
until after our trip to Rhodesia?

32:53.430 --> 32:56.467
You know how much
we've been looking forward to it.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.142
You're going to deny us that as well?

33:04.233 --> 33:07.100
It's the sensitivity of you two together.

33:07.194 --> 33:10.903
The photographers.
It would overshadow everything.

33:10.990 --> 33:16.155
But when you get back,
you'll have some time together.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.782
Alone.

33:18.873 --> 33:21.239
I promise you that.

34:00.289 --> 34:03.873
PETER: They offered me Johannesburg.
I refused.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.165
Then Singapore.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.249
I refused that, too.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.416
Then they came back with Brussels.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.462
It's dreary, but at least it's close.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.048
The whole thing feels like
a completely unnecessary,

34:21.143 --> 34:25.728
-unjustifiable punishment.
-I know.

34:25.814 --> 34:29.272
Perhaps your sister sensed that.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.601
That is why
she's asked me to go to Northern Ireland.

34:32.696 --> 34:33.902
What for?

34:33.989 --> 34:37.573
To accompany her
on her trip to Belfast this week.

34:37.660 --> 34:40.743

She did.

-No, wait. Kiss me.

36:52.378 --> 36:57.498
I do hope it wasn't a mistake
inviting the Group Captain to join us.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.417
You've never cared for him, Tommy.

37:01.512 --> 37:05.346
No, I cared for him as long as he did his job,
and knew his place.

37:06.809 --> 37:08.720
My father held him in high regard.

37:08.811 --> 37:12.224
As a member of staff,
not as a member of the family.

37:14.525 --> 37:16.766
He has been a good friend to us all.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.478
Too good, I would argue.
And he let his wife go in the process.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.905
He was innocent in that regard.

37:25.035 --> 37:29.449
She left of her own accord.
And he's a wonderful father to those boys.

37:29.540 --> 37:32.828
I'm just trying to manage
a difficult situation, ma'am.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.874
As am I.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.378
Sending him away
will break my sister's heart.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.332

The Queen can’t be used to sharing the

But the gathered crowds
certainly seem as interested

the decision has been taken

and then directly to the airfield.

The plane for Brussels
leaves in just under three hours.

46:45.261 --> 46:48.298
There was some concern
that that might not give you enough time,

46:48.390 --> 46:52.053
but I felt sure that as a military man,
packing quickly

46:52.227 --> 46:55.936
and unsentimentally
would come as second nature to you.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.265
But that isn't what was agreed.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.821
The agreement between
Margaret and Her Majesty the Queen,

47:06.908 --> 47:09.024
with the certain knowledge
of Her Majesty the Queen Mother,

47:09.119 --> 47:11.952
was that Margaret and I
were to spend some time together

47:12.038 --> 47:14.245
upon her return from Rhodesia,

47:14.332 --> 47:17.745
before I traveled to Brussels.
Forty-eight hours at least.

47:18.962 --> 47:22.204
Your proposal is a direct contravention
of that agreement.

47:23.299 --> 47:28.965
Well, I cannot, nor would I ever presume
to know the intimate details

47:29.055 --> 47:32.889
of whatever agreements have
or have not been made within the family.

47:33.435 --> 47:37.769
What I can tell you is that the position
of air attache at the embassy fell vacant

47:37.856 --> 47:41.565
unexpectedly early
and needs filling right away.

47:41.651 --> 47:44.188
Of course, a crucial position

47:44.279 --> 47:47.942
like the air attache
to the embassy at Brussels

47:48.033 --> 47:49.989
cannot be left vacant for very long.

47:50.076 --> 47:55.161
I ask only that it remain so
until after the Princess returns,

47:55.248 --> 47:58.581
as I was promised.

48:00.795 --> 48:03.628
I'm afraid that will not be possible.

48:19.647 --> 48:22.309
I understand
you're only trying to do yourjob.

48:23.860 --> 48:27.899
But one thing the trip to Northern Ireland
has made very Clear to me

48:28.073 --> 48:33.067
is that the romance between Margaret
and myself has caught the public eye.

48:33.995 --> 48:35.826
There is a momentum for us,

48:37.624 --> 48:41.742
a sense ofjoy and celebration,
which you would be wise to acknowledge.

48:41.836 --> 48:45.670
The people can Clearly see the sincerity
of the love between Margaret and me,

and I would advise you
not to reprehend us for that.

48:49.636 --> 48:51.422

if I may give you some advice in turn, Peter.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.932

49:01.022 --> 49:05.356
