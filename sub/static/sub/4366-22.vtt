00:02.888 --> 00:06.207
You are being watched.

00:06.209 --> 00:07.592
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.594 --> 00:12.247
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:12.249 --> 00:14.465
I know, because I built it.

00:14.467 --> 00:16.901
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:16.903 --> 00:18.670
but it sees everything...

00:18.672 --> 00:21.455
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:21.457 --> 00:22.891
people like you,

00:22.893 --> 00:26.561
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:26.563 --> 00:29.931
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:29.933 --> 00:31.799
But I needed a partner--

00:31.801 --> 00:34.485
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:34.487 --> 00:38.690
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.692 --> 00:40.641
You will never find us.

00:40.643 --> 00:42.643
But victim or perpetrator,

00:42.645 --> 00:46.030
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:06.852 --> 01:09.837
Thought you would have
turned this thing off by now.

01:09.839 --> 01:12.273
We turn it over tomorrow.

01:12.275 --> 01:15.343
I'm keeping it online
as long as possible.

01:15.345 --> 01:17.345
The world has been spinning
for 5 billion years

01:17.347 --> 01:18.613
without your machine, Harold.

01:18.615 --> 01:23.684
I'm sure it will be fine
for one more night.

01:25.372 --> 01:28.873
Honestly, I'll be glad
to be rid of the thing.

01:28.875 --> 01:32.377
This "thing" has
already saved countless lives.

01:32.379 --> 01:34.746
You mean
countless relevant lives.

01:34.748 --> 01:37.248
We had to draw
the line somewhere.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.083
Everyone is relevant
to someone.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.201
You would know that if you had

01:40.203 --> 01:43.388
anyone in your life
you cared about.

01:43.390 --> 01:47.091
I'm sorry.

01:47.093 --> 01:49.811
What you've built here
is incredible.

01:49.813 --> 01:52.013
And no one else will ever
get a chance to tell you that.

01:52.015 --> 01:57.051
And I don't envy the decisions
you've had to make,

01:57.053 --> 01:58.603
but I worry about you.

01:58.605 --> 02:00.655
Seven years, you've been
watching other people's lives,

02:00.657 --> 02:02.357
their plans,
their relationships.

02:02.359 --> 02:04.392
Maybe it's time for you

02:04.394 --> 02:08.913
to invest a little time
on your own.

02:08.914 --> 02:11.949
Who says I haven't?

02:11.951 --> 02:13.618
I know you like
your secrets, Harold,

02:13.620 --> 02:15.420
but if you had found someone,

02:15.422 --> 02:16.838
I would never hear
the end of it.

02:50.740 --> 02:51.772
Hello, Lionel.

02:51.774 --> 02:53.274
You ready to bust
some dirty cops?

02:53.276 --> 02:55.993
Simmons wants me to meet
the HR Brass next week.

02:55.995 --> 02:58.046
Then call me next week.
I'm busy with research.

02:58.048 --> 03:00.248
Research?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.615
You mean following
your boss again.

03:01.617 --> 03:02.800
You tailed him for weeks.

03:02.802 --> 03:04.168
You couldn't even find out
where he lives.

03:04.170 --> 03:05.553
Yeah, well,
unless you got an address,

03:05.555 --> 03:08.789
I'd say that we're both
striking out, huh?

03:54.971 --> 03:57.004
- Finch?
- We need to meet, Mr. Reese.

03:57.006 --> 04:00.224
We've just received
another number.

04:13.355 --> 04:15.189
We never had this conversation,

04:15.191 --> 04:16.656
but I wanted
to thank you personally

04:16.659 --> 04:18.242
for your work
on the Dubai report.

04:18.244 --> 04:19.761
If you hadn't
flagged Carlson--

04:19.762 --> 04:20.762
Carlson, sir?

04:20.764 --> 04:22.447
He was the key
to the whole thing.

04:22.449 --> 04:25.917
You saved our asses, son.
Thank you, sir.

04:28.837 --> 04:31.305
Henry Peck, 33 years old,

04:31.307 --> 04:33.975
never married,
lives alone in Turtle Bay.

04:33.977 --> 04:36.310
Peck works as a chartered
financial analyst,

04:36.312 --> 04:38.262
which is a fancy way
of saying he picks stocks

04:38.264 --> 04:39.680
for a small financial firm,

04:39.682 --> 04:41.382
Decker North and Associates.

04:41.384 --> 04:44.552
Are you following me?

04:44.554 --> 04:48.656
Financial analyst.
It's riveting.

04:48.658 --> 04:52.510
Well, they can't all be
babies and mafia dons.

04:52.512 --> 04:55.363
So far, the most unusual thing
about Henry Peck is that

04:55.365 --> 04:58.399
he has better-than-average
security habits.

04:58.401 --> 04:59.617
I haven't been able
to hack his voicemail,

04:59.619 --> 05:02.787
his email,
or any online accounts.

05:02.789 --> 05:06.090
Secretive, solitary...

05:06.092 --> 05:09.177
He's just like you, Finch.

05:09.179 --> 05:10.711
So how'd you get his number?

05:10.713 --> 05:13.464
Well, John,
there's this machine...

05:13.466 --> 05:17.585
Yeah, but you didn't
get it here.

05:17.587 --> 05:20.104
No...

05:20.106 --> 05:23.524
It's much more subtle
than that.

05:23.526 --> 05:24.925
And it's time I knew

05:24.927 --> 05:27.945
how the machine
communicates with you.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.297
Why?

05:29.299 --> 05:31.265
Not to be blunt,

05:31.267 --> 05:32.733
but wouldn't you want me
to keep doing this

05:32.735 --> 05:35.936
if something
ever happened to you?

05:37.939 --> 05:42.610
If something ever happens,
I have...

05:42.612 --> 05:43.777
A contingency.

05:43.779 --> 05:45.246
Well, sooner or later,
you're gonna need

05:45.248 --> 05:47.665
to let the cat
out of the bag, Finch.

05:47.667 --> 05:52.220
Curiosity kills cats,
Mr. Reese.

05:56.808 --> 05:59.894
Well, Finch, so far
the biggest threat to Peck

05:59.896 --> 06:00.961
is a paper cut.

06:00.963 --> 06:02.980
Any luck getting
more info on him?

06:02.982 --> 06:06.100
It's gonna take more than luck.

06:06.102 --> 06:07.768
The firm's firewall
is even better than Peck's.

06:07.770 --> 06:10.938
Yeah, I've got line of sight
on his office,

06:10.940 --> 06:13.991
but I can't get any signals
from his wi-fi or his cell.

06:13.993 --> 06:17.445
He works in
the IQZ telecom building.

06:17.447 --> 06:20.031
Financial firms like
to co-locate with internet hubs

06:20.033 --> 06:22.700
so they can get their trades in
a few picoseconds faster.

06:22.702 --> 06:24.835
If you're not getting a signal,

06:24.837 --> 06:28.089
it's probably just interference
from IQZ's antennas.

06:35.514 --> 06:36.714
Couldn't bluejack him, Finch,

06:36.716 --> 06:39.467
so I went old school...
Wireless bug.

06:39.469 --> 06:43.304
Alicia, it's Henry Peck...
Uh, again.

06:43.306 --> 06:44.855
Listen, I really need
to talk to you,

06:44.857 --> 06:46.057
so please just give me a call

06:46.059 --> 06:48.142
and we'll find
a place to meet, okay?

06:48.144 --> 06:51.028
Alicia... So who's Alicia?
An ex-girlfriend?

06:51.030 --> 06:53.648
Or someone he wishes
was a girlfriend?

06:53.650 --> 06:55.199
Mr. Peck!
You forgot to wipe your phone.

06:55.201 --> 06:57.201
He has to wipe
his phone's memory?

06:57.203 --> 06:58.569
It's become common practice

06:58.571 --> 07:00.020
for executes
traveling overseas,

07:00.022 --> 07:01.706
but that's the first time
I've heard of it here.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.624
Sorry, I guess I'm just
a little distracted today.

07:03.626 --> 07:07.295
Well, you work too hard.

07:07.297 --> 07:10.030
I want to know
what goes on in Peck's office,

07:10.032 --> 07:11.832
and since
we can't get signals out,

07:11.834 --> 07:15.086
I'll have to charm my way in.

07:17.839 --> 07:20.675
May I help you?

07:20.677 --> 07:23.728
Yes, um...

07:23.730 --> 07:26.314
John Rooney, assets.

07:26.316 --> 07:29.834
- I have a meeting with...
- Thomas Brewster, CFA.

07:29.836 --> 07:31.936
Tom Brewster.

07:31.938 --> 07:34.021
I'm a tad early.

07:36.909 --> 07:39.660
We just lost the feed
from our bug.

07:39.662 --> 07:41.662
I don't have a record
of that meeting,

07:41.664 --> 07:43.063
and I'm afraid
nobody's allowed back

07:43.065 --> 07:47.284
without an appointment.

07:47.286 --> 07:51.372
Perhaps you should reschedule.

07:51.374 --> 07:55.543
Perhaps I should.

07:55.545 --> 07:56.910
I'm surprised,
Mr. Reese.

07:56.912 --> 07:59.447
That nice young lady
seemed somehow impervious

07:59.449 --> 08:01.632
- to your charms.
- That nice young lady

08:01.634 --> 08:05.686
had a .45 pointed at me
under her desk.

08:05.688 --> 08:08.105
There's a guard and a spin lock
on the main door.

08:08.107 --> 08:11.058
This isn't a financial firm.
It's a SCIF.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.811
Sensitive compartmented
information facility.

08:13.813 --> 08:15.196
Secret government installation

08:15.198 --> 08:17.264
designed to protect
classified data.

08:17.266 --> 08:19.617
Peck's no
financial analyst either.

08:19.619 --> 08:22.453
He's a NOC, some kind of spy.

08:22.455 --> 08:24.271
And you thought
he didn't have a life.

08:24.273 --> 08:29.410
So how do we spy on a spy?

08:29.412 --> 08:32.212
I believe I've found
a way in, Mr. Reese.

08:32.215 --> 08:35.966
The security in Peck's office
blocks wireless signals,

08:35.967 --> 08:38.302
but what about
good old-fashioned wires?

08:38.304 --> 08:40.304
And since every office
runs on caffeine,

08:40.306 --> 08:41.337
all we have to do

08:41.340 --> 08:43.390
is hide a camera
and transceiver

08:43.393 --> 08:44.975
inside a shiny new coffeemaker,

08:44.977 --> 08:47.928
wire it to send data out
through the electrical system,

08:47.930 --> 08:50.765
then wait for them
to plug it in.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.600
Let me play that for you again.

08:52.602 --> 08:54.185
Got a signal, Finch.

08:56.439 --> 08:57.971
That's the voice
of Hassan Ben Amir.

08:57.973 --> 09:00.207
I listened to him every day
when I was at Fort Meade.

09:00.209 --> 09:01.992
Hassan is a major player,

09:01.994 --> 09:03.477
funding terror
throughout the Middle East,

09:03.479 --> 09:06.313
and if he's calling New York,
we need to pay attention.

09:06.315 --> 09:08.783
Now, if you'll look
at these intercepts...

09:08.785 --> 09:10.701
Peck's an intelligence analyst,

09:10.703 --> 09:12.536
and from the sound of it,
a damn good one.

09:12.538 --> 09:14.588
That's why they're
in a telecom building.

09:14.590 --> 09:15.873
They can Jack into the feeds.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.958
It's an NSA listening station.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.228
I guess we'd better listen.

09:23.849 --> 09:27.551
All right, Finch,
Peck just got home.

09:27.553 --> 09:29.703
Time to see what
our spy does at night.

09:29.705 --> 09:33.140
So far... Not much.

09:33.142 --> 09:36.610
Not everyone is
a social butterfly, Mr. Reese.

09:36.612 --> 09:39.513
For some of us,
human interaction is difficult.

09:39.515 --> 09:44.285
Not calling it
"human interaction" might help.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.287
Works around the clock,

09:46.289 --> 09:47.822
no sign of friends or family...

09:47.824 --> 09:51.024
Poor guy doesn't seem
to have much of a life.

09:51.026 --> 09:53.294
Well, we can hardly
fault him for that,

09:53.296 --> 09:55.362
seeing as everyone thinks
we're dead.

09:58.468 --> 10:01.585
Mr. Peck.
Are you there?

10:01.587 --> 10:04.338
Mr. Peck?

10:06.925 --> 10:08.726
Mr. Chen?

10:08.728 --> 10:09.977
Your landlord called
with a complaint.

10:09.979 --> 10:11.595
You mind if we have
a look around, Mr. Peck?

10:11.597 --> 10:13.481
What's this about?

10:13.483 --> 10:15.566
I was wondering the same thing.

10:15.568 --> 10:16.984
Well, apparently
your smoke detector

10:16.986 --> 10:18.352
was malfunctioning today.

10:18.354 --> 10:23.023
When Mr. chen entered
the apartment to fix it...

10:23.025 --> 10:24.825
He saw these.

10:24.827 --> 10:27.578
Adderall, felony weight.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.748
What?
No, that's not mine.

10:30.750 --> 10:31.782
We're sure they'll give you
a chance to explain it

10:31.784 --> 10:33.367
down at the station.
Let's go.

10:33.369 --> 10:35.402
Hold on. I'd rather have the
chance to explain it right here.

10:35.404 --> 10:37.237
Well, Finch,
I think Peck's life

10:37.239 --> 10:38.739
just got
a little more interesting.

10:39.709 --> 10:42.343
- Finch?
- Feedback from the bug.

10:42.345 --> 10:44.912
Something else must be
on the channel.

10:44.914 --> 10:47.481
Trying to clean it...

10:47.483 --> 10:49.850
It's the same signal.

10:49.852 --> 10:53.804
There's another bug.
Someone else is listening.

10:56.274 --> 10:59.560
Yeah, and I think
I've got eyes on him.

11:23.501 --> 11:26.887
I think those drugs
were planted, Finch.

11:26.889 --> 11:30.090
I think Peck's being set up.

11:30.092 --> 11:31.959
Question is, why?

11:49.803 --> 11:52.487
You ever buy 20 copies
of the same magazine, Carter?

11:52.489 --> 11:54.639
- What?
- Never mind.

11:54.641 --> 11:56.308
Do you have news?

11:56.310 --> 11:58.626
Peck made bail
about an hour ago.

11:58.628 --> 12:02.297
I got everything I could
on Henry Peck, which isn't much.

12:02.299 --> 12:05.817
Only one charge on his record,
and Peck had that expunged.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.569
Does he have
a history of drug abuse?

12:07.571 --> 12:11.523
Not even close.
It was a speeding ticket.

12:11.525 --> 12:13.608
He fought to get a speeding
ticket off his record?

12:13.610 --> 12:15.310
It was "the principle
of the thing."

12:15.312 --> 12:16.811
At least, that's what Peck said

12:16.813 --> 12:20.665
in his meticulous, 78-page brief
he sent the judge.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.368
Wow.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.653
Got to love a man
who doesn't know when to quit.

12:25.655 --> 12:27.839
- Thanks, Carter.
- Yep.

12:27.841 --> 12:30.759
Well, Peck's no addict.
Somebody planted those drugs.

12:30.761 --> 12:32.994
I visited the bodega

12:32.996 --> 12:36.664
that's down the street
from Peck's office...

12:36.666 --> 12:40.519
And chatted up
their wireless network,

12:40.521 --> 12:43.772
downloading this video

12:43.774 --> 12:45.724
of someone breaking into
his apartment.

12:45.726 --> 12:50.228
I'm pretty sure that's
the same guy I saw last night.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.631
Whoever he is,
he's well-trained.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.617
Someone's targeting Peck.
We need to figure out why.

12:55.619 --> 12:57.519
And until we figure out
who's after him...

12:57.521 --> 13:00.755
I'll keep an eye on Peck.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.209
Henry, we need to talk.

13:04.211 --> 13:07.629
We know about the arrest
and drug problem.

13:07.631 --> 13:09.464
There is no drug problem.

13:09.466 --> 13:11.783
Under executive order 13526,

13:11.785 --> 13:12.868
your security clearance is suspended,

13:12.870 --> 13:14.703
pending investigation.

13:14.705 --> 13:16.338
You're hereby placed
on administrative leave,

13:16.340 --> 13:17.722
effective immediately.

13:17.724 --> 13:19.891
- Please, sir, you can't just--
- I need you out, Henry.

13:19.893 --> 13:23.178
As of this moment,
you can't work for the NSA.

13:26.232 --> 13:27.482
In the seven years
I've worked here,

13:27.484 --> 13:31.052
the strongest drug
I've taken is aspirin.

13:31.054 --> 13:32.320
There's something else
going on here.

13:32.322 --> 13:33.688
I'm being set up.

13:33.690 --> 13:36.057
If you're alleging
some greater conspiracy here,

13:36.059 --> 13:39.244
I can add that to your file,

13:39.246 --> 13:42.697
but it might make you
seem unstable.

13:50.006 --> 13:54.709
Question authority
and they call you crazy.

13:54.711 --> 13:56.628
Peck's being forced out.

13:56.630 --> 13:57.879
I don't know about you,
Mr. Reese,

13:57.881 --> 14:01.416
but I'd very much like
to know why.

14:01.418 --> 14:04.352
I'm sorry to keep calling,
but it's really important.

14:04.354 --> 14:07.105
Please, I just need to speak
to Ted Gibbons, my--

14:07.107 --> 14:10.976
Hello?

14:10.978 --> 14:12.777
Recognize that name, Finch?

14:12.779 --> 14:15.564
Theodore Gibbons,
deputy director of the NSA.

14:15.566 --> 14:17.983
He's going over
his boss' head, way over.

14:17.985 --> 14:20.151
Whatever Peck's into, it's big.

14:20.153 --> 14:22.103
"Out of the country"?
Really?

14:22.105 --> 14:23.872
Because some guy
at headquarters just told me

14:23.874 --> 14:25.407
he was in a meeting.
Please.

14:25.409 --> 14:27.058
Now, all I did
was ask questions.

14:27.060 --> 14:31.213
Any decent analyst wou--
Hello?

14:31.215 --> 14:33.031
Hello?

14:33.033 --> 14:37.168
Someone is destroying Peck's
life for asking questions.

14:37.170 --> 14:42.791
About what?

14:42.793 --> 14:45.227
Finch, the security camera
over Peck's door,

14:45.229 --> 14:46.428
was it working last night?

14:46.430 --> 14:47.846
Yes. Why?

14:47.848 --> 14:51.132
Because someone's
in his apartment.

14:56.689 --> 15:00.325
What the hell?

15:05.481 --> 15:08.166
Mr. Reese, is everything o--

15:08.168 --> 15:11.369
I'll take that as a no.

15:37.563 --> 15:41.650
Finch, I know a government
trained assassin when I see one.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.652
They're not
just after Peck's job.

15:43.654 --> 15:45.487
Someone in Washington
wants him dead.

15:45.489 --> 15:48.073
Then we need
to protect him, Mr. Reese.

15:48.075 --> 15:49.524
He can't have gotten far.

15:49.526 --> 15:52.744
I'll use the bug
to track him down.

16:01.337 --> 16:04.973
- Hello?
- Hi, Ted Gibbons please.

16:04.975 --> 16:06.174
Hello?

16:06.176 --> 16:08.310
Deputy director Gibbons,
my name is Henry Peck.

16:08.312 --> 16:09.761
I work for you.

16:09.763 --> 16:11.096
This is my daughter's
cell phone.

16:11.098 --> 16:12.564
How did you get this number?

16:12.566 --> 16:13.765
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,

16:13.767 --> 16:15.116
but someone just tried
to kill me.

16:15.118 --> 16:16.434
What?

16:16.436 --> 16:18.970
Now, three weeks ago,
you called me off the record

16:18.972 --> 16:20.888
to congratulate me
on a report that I submitted

16:20.890 --> 16:22.741
that led to
the high-level arrest

16:22.743 --> 16:25.577
of a man named Carlson,
but I never heard of a Carlson.

16:25.579 --> 16:27.112
His name was in your report.

16:27.114 --> 16:28.396
But I didn't put it there.

16:28.398 --> 16:29.781
Someone slipped this name
into my report,

16:29.783 --> 16:30.915
and that one name was the key

16:30.917 --> 16:32.417
to stopping
a major terrorist attack.

16:32.419 --> 16:35.754
All I did was ask questions.

16:35.756 --> 16:38.623
I have been arrested,
I have lost my job,

16:38.625 --> 16:39.791
and they're trying
to execute me,

16:39.793 --> 16:43.911
and I just want to know why.

16:43.913 --> 16:45.513
Don't ever call me again.

16:52.722 --> 16:55.089
Everything okay, Finch?

16:55.091 --> 16:58.143
I know who wants Peck dead
and I know why.

16:58.145 --> 17:01.212
I know what he's been
asking questions about.

17:01.214 --> 17:06.151
They want him dead
because of me.

17:06.153 --> 17:07.368
Henry Peck doesn't know it,

17:07.371 --> 17:13.208
but he's been asking
about the machine.

17:32.043 --> 17:33.293
No.

17:33.295 --> 17:35.161
Is something wrong, Alicia?

17:35.163 --> 17:38.131
You mean other than being
a part of an ongoing conspiracy

17:38.133 --> 17:40.283
to spy on
millions of Americans?

17:40.285 --> 17:44.254
Yes, but it's all
for a good cause.

17:47.509 --> 17:50.960
Day after tomorrow,
freight train out of Des Moines.

17:50.962 --> 17:53.980
The last six cars, the manifest
will list the contents

17:53.982 --> 17:57.633
as decommissioned
computer parts.

17:57.635 --> 18:00.286
What about things on your end?

18:00.288 --> 18:03.306
The facility is designed to
the specifications you gave us,

18:03.308 --> 18:05.475
and it's discreet,
where we're putting it.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.010
No one's going to go looking.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.745
Any other problem?

18:08.747 --> 18:11.314
Dissemination.

18:11.316 --> 18:13.333
We have a protocol in place.

18:13.335 --> 18:15.118
If the machine
identifies a suspect,

18:15.120 --> 18:17.587
the name will find its way
to the right people...

18:17.589 --> 18:20.824
With no way to trace the intel
back to the source.

18:20.826 --> 18:23.259
There can't be.
Otherwise...

18:23.261 --> 18:24.677
We'll all wind up someplace

18:24.679 --> 18:27.847
where no one's
going to go looking.

18:27.849 --> 18:29.665
Eight people in the world
know it exists.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.453
We need to keep it that way.

18:33.455 --> 18:35.522
Seven, Nathan.

18:35.524 --> 18:39.642
Seven people,
unless you told someone.

18:42.514 --> 18:45.782
Come on, Alicia,
you know I'm terrible at math.

18:45.784 --> 18:51.037
The people on your end...

18:51.039 --> 18:52.122
You sure about them?

18:52.124 --> 18:53.856
Making sure no one
ever finds out

18:53.858 --> 18:56.459
about the machine
is our problem.

18:56.461 --> 19:01.381
We'll take care of it.

19:01.383 --> 19:04.467
We've known each other
a long time, Alicia.

19:04.469 --> 19:06.386
Something's got you rattled.

19:06.388 --> 19:08.972
I'm fine, Nathan.

19:08.974 --> 19:10.473
I'll be happier
when this thing is settled

19:10.475 --> 19:12.509
and I can go back
to my day job.

19:12.511 --> 19:14.177
And what's that exactly?

19:14.179 --> 19:17.914
Classified.

19:20.101 --> 19:23.653
You can buy me that drink now.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.414
Yeah, Carter?

19:34.416 --> 19:36.399
One of Peck's neighbors
called 911,

19:36.401 --> 19:38.368
said they saw two men
fighting in his apartment.

19:38.370 --> 19:39.335
Is everything okay?

19:39.337 --> 19:40.670
The situation
has been resolved.

19:40.672 --> 19:41.704
We're fine now, Detective.

19:41.706 --> 19:43.739
Thank you.

19:47.178 --> 19:50.380
Doesn't sound resolved to me.

20:00.307 --> 20:04.360
So Peck asks
about your machine,

20:04.362 --> 20:05.478
and now someone's
trying to kill him.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.831
Something you want
to tell me, Finch?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.366
As with all computer systems,

20:10.368 --> 20:11.934
the big problem is human error.

20:11.936 --> 20:13.903
Strictly speaking,
the machine is not legal.

20:13.905 --> 20:15.438
I always knew
that certain measures

20:15.440 --> 20:20.410
would be taken
to protect it, but...

20:20.412 --> 20:22.829
But as I found out myself,

20:22.831 --> 20:25.415
the people I've entrusted it
to are more...

20:25.417 --> 20:27.450
Ruthless than I anticipated.

20:31.289 --> 20:33.640
- Hello?
- Is this Peck?

20:33.642 --> 20:35.558
Alicia Corwin?

20:35.560 --> 20:38.061
Corwin?

20:38.063 --> 20:40.430
That's the Alicia
he's trying to meet?

20:40.432 --> 20:42.432
She worked for
the National Security Council.

20:42.434 --> 20:43.850
Miss Corwin, are you there?

20:43.852 --> 20:46.236
You've been looking for me?

20:46.238 --> 20:47.403
Can we meet?

20:47.405 --> 20:51.324
No.

20:51.326 --> 20:52.859
Two months ago,
a report I wrote was changed

20:52.861 --> 20:54.444
when it went
through your office,

20:54.446 --> 20:57.080
but your office has been
shut down for more than a year.

20:57.082 --> 20:58.915
Please, I just want to know
what's going on.

20:58.917 --> 21:02.118
I just want my life back.

21:05.756 --> 21:08.258
Sibilance.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.543
Okay.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.028
Is there anything else
you can tell me?

21:12.030 --> 21:16.933
Run.

21:32.516 --> 21:35.201
We need to stop him,
Mr. Reese.

21:35.203 --> 21:37.537
From learning
more about the machine,

21:37.539 --> 21:39.789
about Sibilance,
whatever that is.

21:39.791 --> 21:42.125
We need to treat this
like an outbreak.

21:42.127 --> 21:43.242
Peck is infected--

21:43.244 --> 21:45.578
With an idea,
but infected all the same.

21:45.580 --> 21:48.214
Anybody he talks to
can wind up dead,

21:48.216 --> 21:49.582
and everything
that Peck uncovers

21:49.584 --> 21:51.050
makes it that
much more impossible

21:51.052 --> 21:52.468
for us to save his life.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.253
So let's just get him
to a safe house.

21:54.255 --> 21:55.888
It's not that simple.

21:55.890 --> 21:57.373
He'll want to know who we are,

21:57.375 --> 21:58.725
and knowing that
would put him closer

21:58.727 --> 21:59.809
to finding out
about the machine.

22:00.729 --> 22:02.261
Whatever we do to save Peck,

22:02.263 --> 22:05.515
it must be without him
knowing that we exist.

22:05.517 --> 22:08.735
Mr. Reese,
are you even listening?

22:11.105 --> 22:12.572
Well, now we have
a bigger problem.

22:12.574 --> 22:18.761
Peck found the bug,
and he just gave us the slip.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.401
Peck's cashed out
his bank accounts.

22:25.403 --> 22:28.421
His credit cards
are popping up at cheap hotels

22:28.423 --> 22:30.456
and liquor stores
all over the city.

22:30.458 --> 22:34.427
He's probably handing them out
to the homeless.

22:34.429 --> 22:35.845
The NSA certainly taught him

22:35.847 --> 22:38.681
how to scatter
a digital footprint.

22:38.683 --> 22:40.767
Finch, are you getting
anything off Peck's phone?

22:40.769 --> 22:43.085
Unfortunately, they taught him

22:43.087 --> 22:44.804
how to brick
a cell phone as well.

22:44.806 --> 22:46.756
The flash memory
is unrecoverable.

22:46.758 --> 22:48.975
What can you tell us
about the people hunting him?

22:48.977 --> 22:51.944
An elite squad,

22:51.946 --> 22:53.613
probably a three-man team.

22:53.615 --> 22:57.367
The guy I fought had a handgun
chambered for rifle ammunition,

22:57.369 --> 22:58.651
so it shreds Kevlar.

22:58.653 --> 23:01.487
Only one unit I know
gave those as standard issue...

23:01.489 --> 23:04.273
Intelligence Support Activity,

23:04.275 --> 23:06.709
an obscure army unit
that does black-ops so dark,

23:06.711 --> 23:08.161
technically, they don't exist.

23:08.163 --> 23:10.580
Guess we better
find Peck first.

23:10.582 --> 23:13.216
They'll hunt him like I would,
start with his needs...

23:13.218 --> 23:18.471
Sleep, a place to hide,
and a way to get information.

23:18.473 --> 23:23.393
Cash-only hotels
with internet access.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.962
There's been a complication.

23:26.964 --> 23:28.131
The target's still in play.

23:28.133 --> 23:31.300
That's not a complication.

23:31.302 --> 23:32.318
That's failure.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.320
- He has assistance.
- Who?

23:34.322 --> 23:36.406
Unknown.
One of ours, I think,

23:36.408 --> 23:38.641
or at least he used to be.

23:38.643 --> 23:39.992
We've lost
the element of surprise

23:39.994 --> 23:42.111
and the ability to make it
look like an accident.

23:42.113 --> 23:43.362
What's the mandate?

23:43.364 --> 23:45.665
Take the gloves off.

23:45.667 --> 23:49.252
Get it done.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.155
I've got a hit,
Mr. Reese,

23:53.157 --> 23:54.340
a youth hostel
in hell's kitchen.

23:54.342 --> 23:55.991
I can't be certain
he's still there,

23:55.993 --> 23:58.344
but Peck definitely
used their computer.

23:58.346 --> 24:02.548
He wasn't able to dig up
anything on Sibilance,

24:02.550 --> 24:04.333
but he had good luck
finding a pinout

24:04.335 --> 24:06.185
to hack the card reader
at his office.

24:06.187 --> 24:09.772
I believe Mr. Peck is planning
to break into the NSA.

24:34.832 --> 24:36.299
He's in.

24:36.301 --> 24:37.583
So am I.

24:37.585 --> 24:39.702
Then I'd very much
appreciate it

24:39.704 --> 24:41.554
if you would stop Peck from
getting any more information

24:41.556 --> 24:43.973
- that'll get him killed.
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

24:43.975 --> 24:47.593
but if I take those reports,
he's gonna know I exist.

24:47.595 --> 24:49.595
I recognize this is
a challenging situation,

24:49.597 --> 24:52.014
but you have
to avoid direct contact.

24:52.016 --> 24:53.349
Peck!

25:03.278 --> 25:06.746
You're right, Mr. Reese.
It's a three-man team.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.168
Two and half.

25:20.544 --> 25:24.881
Hey, hey!

25:27.051 --> 25:28.417
Hey, I just broke in
that building, okay?

25:28.419 --> 25:29.552
You gonna arrest me?

25:29.554 --> 25:32.855
What the hell's
the matter with you?

25:32.857 --> 25:34.256
Hey, don't lose those.
That's evidence.

25:34.258 --> 25:35.441
You're gonna want that
when I confess.

25:35.443 --> 25:37.760
Relax, pal.
Soon as I read you your rights,

25:37.762 --> 25:39.395
you can tell us everything.

25:39.397 --> 25:40.897
Get your head down.

25:46.654 --> 25:50.439
Finch?

25:50.441 --> 25:52.491
You're not gonna like this.

26:13.022 --> 26:15.890
Everything's in place.

26:15.892 --> 26:20.228
Point-to-point transit
will take ten days.

26:20.230 --> 26:23.314
Hope nothing goes wrong
in the rest of the world

26:23.316 --> 26:27.035
in ten days.

26:28.571 --> 26:30.655
Wait.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.108
Do we have a contingency?

26:33.110 --> 26:35.293
A contingency?

26:35.295 --> 26:37.746
Alicia seemed...
Nervous.

26:37.748 --> 26:39.030
Now, what do we do

26:39.032 --> 26:44.135
if the government decides
to abuse this thing?

26:44.137 --> 26:45.570
They're your contacts, Nathan.

26:45.572 --> 26:47.538
They're just people.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.208
The power that
this thing represents--

26:50.210 --> 26:51.543
I mean, who would you
trust it with?

26:51.545 --> 26:54.212
Besides you?
No one.

26:54.214 --> 26:56.815
Which is why the machine
has been coded in such a way

26:56.817 --> 27:00.735
that it cannot be abused.
It cannot even be accessed.

27:00.737 --> 27:04.155
It upgrades itself,
maintains itself,

27:04.157 --> 27:06.908
patches itself.

27:06.910 --> 27:11.395
After tonight,
no one can alter it. Ever.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.782
I used to be
a software engineer, Harold.

27:13.784 --> 27:18.703
Remember, back before
I became your corporate beard?

27:18.705 --> 27:21.956
Any system can be compromised,
given enough time.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.045
We need an off switch,
a back door,

27:27.047 --> 27:30.298
and this is our last chance
to build one.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.519
You are a talented engineer,
Nathan,

27:34.521 --> 27:37.772
so you should remember...

27:37.774 --> 27:41.442
Any exploit is a total exploit.

27:41.444 --> 27:43.928
The tiniest crack
becomes a flood.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.264
If we build a back door
into this machine

27:46.266 --> 27:50.819
and someone else
finds out about it,

27:50.821 --> 27:55.123
that would be...
Very bad.

27:57.159 --> 28:01.546
We need to trust the machine,
exactly as we built it,

28:01.548 --> 28:06.334
and then let it go.

28:48.878 --> 28:49.844
Car three to central.

28:49.846 --> 28:51.679
Suspect in custody.

28:51.681 --> 28:53.831
Subject's name is
Peck, Henry L.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.550
We've got a BOLO on that guy.

28:55.552 --> 28:57.635
Take him to Detective Carter
at the eighth.

28:57.637 --> 29:00.521
Please just listen.
They've taken my job,

29:00.523 --> 29:02.140
ruined my life.

29:02.142 --> 29:04.559
Now I know why.
This is the proof.

29:04.561 --> 29:07.028
These are six reports
I wrote for the NSA,

29:07.030 --> 29:09.147
and six covert actions
based on those reports.

29:09.149 --> 29:11.699
In each case, a single name
gets added to what I wrote,

29:11.701 --> 29:13.451
and each time,
that name turns out to be

29:13.453 --> 29:15.620
the key to stopping
a major terrorist attack.

29:15.622 --> 29:17.071
Six for six.

29:17.073 --> 29:19.207
The only way
to be that accurate

29:19.209 --> 29:22.710
is with illegal surveillance
on a massive scale.

29:22.712 --> 29:23.745
Then there's this,

29:23.747 --> 29:25.129
"Sibilance" is
an internal audit

29:25.131 --> 29:27.632
of the NSA intranet.
It's totally routine--

29:27.634 --> 29:28.833
Until they find signals

29:28.835 --> 29:31.419
hidden just beyond
the Shannon limit.

29:31.421 --> 29:33.805
It should just be static,
but there was data.

29:33.807 --> 29:36.374
Someone is sneaking
just as much data out

29:36.376 --> 29:38.092
as the NSA is taking in.

29:38.094 --> 29:40.711
To scan through all that,

29:40.713 --> 29:44.732
you need an organization
ten times our size.

29:44.734 --> 29:48.519
It's more
than any human--

29:54.360 --> 29:59.998
Oh, my God,
they actually built it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.450
After 9/11,
the government wanted

30:02.452 --> 30:05.736
a computer system--
A machine--

30:05.738 --> 30:07.789
That could watch everyone
and everything,

30:07.791 --> 30:09.407
catch terrorists
before they strike.

30:09.409 --> 30:12.293
They tried with trailblazer,

30:12.295 --> 30:16.080
TIA, stellar wind.
They-- they all failed.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.682
But if I'm right,

30:17.684 --> 30:20.751
then someone really
built the damn thing,

30:20.753 --> 30:25.690
and it's watching us right now.

30:27.592 --> 30:30.812
Okay, you want
a soda or something?

30:32.948 --> 30:34.615
You just questioned my suspect?

30:34.617 --> 30:35.950
Questioned your suspect?

30:35.952 --> 30:38.436
Guy's in there talking
a blue streak all by himself.

30:38.438 --> 30:41.406
Should be wearing
a tinfoil hat.

30:41.408 --> 30:43.241
Gets arrested yesterday
for drugs,

30:43.243 --> 30:45.376
tonight he throws
a bottle at a cop--

30:45.378 --> 30:49.213
This guy's out of his mind.

30:49.215 --> 30:53.301
We need to get you
out of here, Henry.

30:53.303 --> 30:54.919
Who are you?

30:56.506 --> 30:57.889
♪ Johnny's in America ♪

30:57.891 --> 31:01.225
♪ no tricks at the wheel ♪

31:04.730 --> 31:06.397
I suppose
we can count our blessings

31:06.399 --> 31:08.566
Detective Fusco
isn't the inquisitive type.

31:08.568 --> 31:10.318
But Peck's in
more danger than ever.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.688
Seriously,
who the hell are you?

31:13.690 --> 31:16.474
All Henry Peck did
was ask questions.

31:16.476 --> 31:18.242
He deserves a normal life,

31:18.244 --> 31:19.994
and if we have any hope
of giving it to him,

31:19.996 --> 31:21.529
we have to destroy
all that evidence

31:21.531 --> 31:23.781
and stop him
from getting any more.

31:26.369 --> 31:27.869
Yes, my name is Henry Peck.

31:27.871 --> 31:30.338
- I'm an analyst--
- Who did you just call?

31:30.340 --> 31:31.839
The office of Special Counsel.

31:31.841 --> 31:34.342
It's the agency
that protects whistleblowers.

31:34.344 --> 31:37.261
Oh, I really wish you hadn't
let him do that, Mr. Reese.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.996
The people who know
about the machine,

31:38.998 --> 31:41.999
one of them works for
the office of Special Counsel.

31:43.636 --> 31:44.852
What are you doing?

31:44.854 --> 31:46.471
Our own government
is spying on us

31:46.473 --> 31:48.689
and they want to kill me
to cover it up.

31:48.691 --> 31:50.058
I have to tell someone!

31:50.060 --> 31:54.062
The people you called
aren't who you think they are.

31:54.064 --> 31:58.783
There's no one to tell.
No one is safe.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.955
He just called us.

32:03.957 --> 32:07.675
I'm sending
their last known coordinates.

32:07.677 --> 32:10.495
That's all I need.

32:10.497 --> 32:16.084
♪ Johnny's in America ♪

32:16.086 --> 32:19.470
♪ I'm afraid of Americans ♪

32:19.472 --> 32:20.588

32:21.674 --> 32:22.723

32:22.725 --> 32:25.760

32:25.762 --> 32:28.229

33:31.524 --> 33:33.958
Do you know why
you were ordered to kill him?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.561
Never asked.

33:43.419 --> 33:47.872
- Okay, Peck,
let's get you out of--

33:51.810 --> 33:54.812
This isn't over, Finch.

33:54.814 --> 33:58.683
The man wrote 78 pages
to fight a speeding ticket.

33:58.685 --> 34:03.321
I know.
He's not gonna give up.

34:03.323 --> 34:05.523
And neither are the people
who know about the machine.

34:05.525 --> 34:07.992
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

34:07.994 --> 34:11.112
A good friend
once showed me that,

34:11.114 --> 34:14.899
even with
an intractable problem,

34:14.900 --> 34:18.319
one can still find a way
to do the right thing.

34:57.343 --> 34:59.544
Your predecessors failed,

34:59.546 --> 35:01.563
and now Peck's
reaching out to the press.

35:01.565 --> 35:05.650
He's meeting
a reporter tomorrow.

35:05.652 --> 35:07.118
I want you
to silence them both.

35:07.120 --> 35:11.439
We'll be there.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.667
You're not the reporter.

35:22.669 --> 35:26.288
No. No, I'm not.
Oh, she's quite safe.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.572
Right now,
my associate is dealing

35:27.574 --> 35:30.792
with the assassins
who were sent to kill you both.

35:35.681 --> 35:39.184
The answer
to your question is yes.

35:39.186 --> 35:42.604
It exists.

35:42.606 --> 35:44.589
And it's watching us right now.

35:44.591 --> 35:46.608
I'm telling you this

35:46.610 --> 35:49.611
because you remind me
a little of myself.

35:49.613 --> 35:51.696
And I know that, if I were you,

35:51.698 --> 35:54.566
I would keep asking
until I knew the truth.

35:54.568 --> 35:57.786
So now you do.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.788
Now stop asking the question.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.791
Where is it?

36:02.793 --> 36:04.376
How does it work?
I mean, the servers alone--

36:04.378 --> 36:09.030
I know how you feel.

36:09.032 --> 36:12.617
Your need to understand.

36:12.619 --> 36:14.502
But believe me,
Mr. Peck,

36:14.504 --> 36:17.005
this is a mystery
you do not want to solve.

36:17.007 --> 36:18.890
Knowing the answer

36:18.892 --> 36:22.794
has cost me something
I value more than my own life.

36:29.101 --> 36:31.019
Clean passport, plane tickets,

36:31.021 --> 36:35.023
a bank card to a well-funded
account in your new name.

36:35.025 --> 36:37.975
Please, Mr. Peck,

36:37.977 --> 36:42.580
for your own sake--
and quite frankly, for mine--

36:42.582 --> 36:45.583
Go and live your life.
Find some secrets of your own.

36:45.585 --> 36:51.206
And if you really
need a mystery,

36:51.208 --> 36:54.992
I recommend the human heart.

36:54.994 --> 36:58.263
How do you know all this?

37:01.717 --> 37:05.270
Because I built it.

37:12.027 --> 37:13.528
- Carter.
- Yeah?

37:13.530 --> 37:16.114
That guy Peck who pulled
the disappearing act,

37:16.116 --> 37:18.182
we just pulled his prints off
a burnt-out cab

37:18.184 --> 37:19.484
with a john doe next to it.

37:19.486 --> 37:21.369
What about Peck?
Any idea where he is now?

37:21.371 --> 37:24.322
He's in the wind.

37:24.324 --> 37:25.490
A bunch of paper
burned up in that cab.

37:25.492 --> 37:30.695
All we could make out was this.

37:42.542 --> 37:45.810
Hey, this HR deal's a lock.

37:45.812 --> 37:46.878
We get three days to prepare.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.046
Now we gonna do this or not?

37:48.048 --> 37:49.264
We'll be ready.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.099
I'll call you as soon
as I'm done here.

37:51.101 --> 37:52.434
Yeah, right.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.218
Like you'll ever be done
spying on Mr. Glasses.

37:54.220 --> 37:58.990
Next time I see you,
I just might have his address.

38:01.160 --> 38:05.947
John, your order's ready.

38:17.843 --> 38:21.212
And you're here every day?

38:37.980 --> 38:42.150
Hello, Finch.

38:50.776 --> 38:53.278
Can I help you?

38:53.280 --> 38:56.080
Sorry to bother you.

38:56.082 --> 38:58.550
Detective Stills.

38:58.552 --> 39:00.785
Someone reported
a disturbance at this address.

39:00.787 --> 39:03.555
Really?
I'm the only one here.

39:03.557 --> 39:05.306
Probably just an old lady
who saw a shadow

39:05.308 --> 39:06.508
or a kid playing a joke.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.427
We just have
to check everything out.

39:09.429 --> 39:11.179
Do you want help with these?

39:11.181 --> 39:15.517
Uh, sure. Thanks.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.137
There must be
about 50 copies here.

39:20.139 --> 39:23.491
You a collector?

39:23.493 --> 39:25.810
Uh, kind of.

39:25.812 --> 39:27.445
They send me extras
when it's one of mine.

39:27.447 --> 39:29.831
You draw the covers.

39:29.833 --> 39:32.283
Yeah.
A bit old-fashioned, I know.

39:32.285 --> 39:34.118
Everything's going digital.
Print is dying.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.171
But, uh, every time I think
I'll never work again,

39:37.173 --> 39:40.959
another magazine
or newspaper calls, so...

39:40.961 --> 39:44.712
Guess I have a guardian angel.

39:47.349 --> 39:49.801
Who's this?

39:49.803 --> 39:54.155
Um, that's Harold, my fiance.

39:54.157 --> 39:56.925
Looks like a nice guy.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.060
Yeah.

39:59.062 --> 40:01.613
He's a very nice guy.

40:01.615 --> 40:05.683
I never really thought
that I'd meet anyone who got me.

40:05.685 --> 40:08.453
You know, spending all
your time alone, drawing,

40:08.455 --> 40:11.489
isn't exactly
the best way to find someone.

40:11.491 --> 40:13.291
But Harold found me.

40:13.293 --> 40:15.910
I was painting
in the park one day,

40:15.912 --> 40:18.796
and... There was this man,

40:18.798 --> 40:22.834
eating an ice cream cone
in January.

40:22.836 --> 40:23.968
And he smiled at me.

40:23.970 --> 40:27.204
He asked me if I wanted one.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.645
Does he live here with you?

40:33.647 --> 40:35.212
No, he doesn't.

40:35.214 --> 40:38.900
Um, he used to.

40:38.902 --> 40:42.887
I lost him two years ago.

40:42.889 --> 40:46.858
There was an accident.

40:46.860 --> 40:50.061
I'm sorry.

41:12.885 --> 41:15.019
Good location.

41:15.021 --> 41:18.940
Clear line of sight,

41:18.942 --> 41:21.192
but enough obstructions
and distance

41:21.194 --> 41:25.196
to avoid being seen.

41:25.198 --> 41:26.698
I built an app that alerts me

41:26.700 --> 41:28.933
if I ever get
within 100 meters of her.

41:28.935 --> 41:34.756
I've never regretted
building the machine.

41:34.758 --> 41:38.076
But I didn't fully realize
the personal cost.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.328
I'm good with computers.

41:40.330 --> 41:45.416
People-- Well,
people other than Grace--

41:45.418 --> 41:47.035
have always
been a mystery to me.

41:47.037 --> 41:48.970
I failed to recognize

41:48.972 --> 41:53.424
the lengths to which they would
go to protect the machine,

41:53.426 --> 41:57.294
to control it.

41:57.296 --> 42:00.798
By the time I realized it,
it was too late...

42:00.800 --> 42:04.135
For me.

42:04.137 --> 42:07.304
But not for her.

42:07.306 --> 42:09.157
You see, Mr. Reese,

42:09.159 --> 42:12.577
if knowing about the machine
is like a virus,

42:12.579 --> 42:15.446
that makes me patient zero.

42:15.448 --> 42:19.667
Simply being near me
was putting her life in danger.

42:23.706 --> 42:25.540
I'm sorry.

42:25.542 --> 42:28.292
I was lucky.

42:28.294 --> 42:32.096
I had four years of...

42:32.098 --> 42:36.184
Happiness.

42:36.186 --> 42:39.470
Some people only get four days.

43:04.072 --> 43:06.045
Please, Mr. Peck,
for your own sake--

43:06.734 --> 43:09.000
and quite frankly,
for mine--

43:10.313 --> 43:11.588
Go live your life.

43:14.073 --> 43:15.656
Find some secrets of your own.

43:15.658 --> 43:17.658
♪ God is an American ♪

43:17.660 --> 43:21.495
And if you really
need a mystery,

43:21.497 --> 43:26.167
I recommend the human heart.

43:26.169 --> 43:27.801
How do you know all this?

43:27.803 --> 43:30.787
♪ God is an American ♪

43:30.789 --> 43:33.057
Because I built it.

43:33.808 --> 43:39.763
♪ God is an American ♪

43:39.765 --> 43:43.100
♪ God is an American ♪

43:43.102 --> 43:45.135
