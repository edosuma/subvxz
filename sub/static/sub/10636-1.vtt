WEBVTT

00:44.607 --> 00:51.556
Take it off. My bulletts speed if
by head I wanna spite name on it.

00:57.607 --> 01:01.822
The blood of many brave men have
been shared on that wall.

01:01.987 --> 01:05.963
It will give you some comfort
to share in their glory.

01:07.127 --> 01:11.200
- I accept that honour.
- The honour is mine.

01:16.887 --> 01:22.200
- The last words?
- Death is the end of pain.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.323
The last pain.

01:42.527 --> 01:45.439
Death is the end of pain.

02:07.647 --> 02:12.198
It's a man enough gun you got there, sir
Is that...?

02:15.967 --> 02:18.464
I won't gonna steal it or nothing,
I just want to see it up close.

02:18.465 --> 02:22.486
Is this close enough?

02:22.647 --> 02:25.115
Yes,sir.

02:27.487 --> 02:29.188
Yeah, you got out of here, cabron!
He's been hanging around here

02:29.189 --> 02:33.339
In the last couple of days
and not drinkin' a din.

02:33.407 --> 02:37.995
- Brandy.
- It's no brandy, sir.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.817
- Whisky.
- Right.

02:47.327 --> 02:54.721
Pass the Lord for forgiveness, he'll save
your soul. Would you like a prayer sheet?

03:10.847 --> 03:16.646
- So, you are here for the hanging?
- No. I have other business.

03:16.707 --> 03:21.839
Stick around?
Here, in Bagatoria was big entertainment.

03:22.007 --> 03:25.522
Open your heart to the kingdom of heaven
there is a seat for you by his throne.

03:25.827 --> 03:29.560
Pass God for forgive you and he will.
Would you like a prayer sheet?

03:47.927 --> 03:53.443
- I don't want to be here when it happens.
How soon to they're ready?

03:53.607 --> 03:55.146
I'll go and see.

04:04.407 --> 04:06.562
Has Villa a ridden through here?

04:06.727 --> 04:10.766
East side of you. Why?

04:10.807 --> 04:12.982
I've something very valuable.

04:13.847 --> 04:16.003
Well, the best place to track in is Tierra Negra.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.800
It's a bit of days ride from here,
but it's rough country, bad lands.

04:19.947 --> 04:23.205
Travellers like you might not want to go alone.
- Really?

04:28.607 --> 04:34.442
It's better you travel with company. That
stedickles there is going that direction.

04:35.607 --> 04:39.299
Senor! A lot of white folks
go miss in these parts.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.919
Can I ask your name in
case someone came looking?

04:42.997 --> 04:49.798
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce.
And no one will come looking.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.437
Brother! Can I offer you a
life and a resurrection?

05:59.607 --> 06:01.599
My name is John Newlie.
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce.

06:01.807 --> 06:03.685
Guess we are travelling together.
-Really?

06:05.087 --> 06:07.318
Who gets the fare?

06:08.727 --> 06:14.400
He has no tongue. I'm his
voice, he is my eyes.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.680
You are safe with us.
I'm filled with confidence.

06:44.247 --> 06:45.979
Die! Die!

06:59.247 --> 07:01.540
I know you.

07:44.207 --> 07:52.644
Madrid. Look at me Madrid.
Look at me!

07:53.407 --> 07:56.477
Look in the eyes that will watch
you swinging from that rope,

07:57.087 --> 07:59.798
my ears will hear the crack
of your neck breaking,

08:01.167 --> 08:04.202
my nose will smell the
shit in your pants,

08:04.607 --> 08:08.043
and my mouth will laugh when you die.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.477
Hold him!

08:52.367 --> 08:56.517
Esmeralda! What are you
doing here? Go home!

08:57.047 --> 08:59.664
I won't tell you again!

09:00.287 --> 09:02.362
I want to see it.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.924
You dare to disobey me now?
Even to my face?

09:08.247 --> 09:09.964
Bring her!

09:10.247 --> 09:11.702
No! No!

09:23.167 --> 09:25.858
She is your daughter.
Your own flesh and blood.

09:54.047 --> 09:55.645
Any last words?

09:59.707 --> 10:01.526
See you in hell.

10:09.207 --> 10:11.679
That one has a devil on the side.

13:10.047 --> 13:11.477
Esmeralda.

13:42.647 --> 13:46.241
She is your daughter! What are
you doing?  You could kill her!

13:47.307 --> 13:51.121
I'd rather see her dead!
Go get the horses!

14:07.187 --> 14:08.705
Is something the matter John?

14:08.967 --> 14:12.303
No, what'd I thought I left the Bibles.
But here they are!

14:12.467 --> 14:17.140
Thank Godness! We can't start a
Bible school in tierra Negra without Bibles!

14:20.207 --> 14:22.182
Perhaps Mr. Bierce would like one.

14:22.467 --> 14:25.502
Oh no, no thank you. I've already read it.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.843
You have.

14:28.607 --> 14:33.578
Nice thing of the good book is
that it covers too far apart.

14:34.247 --> 14:35.643
Excuse me?

14:35.707 --> 14:40.405
I'm on the opinion that the Bible is perhaps
the greatest assemblage of lies and

14:40.567 --> 14:42.520
untruth ever gathered together. 

14:42.521 --> 14:44.291
A possible exception is 
the Congressional Record.

14:44.307 --> 14:46.359
- Are you an atheist, sir?
- Yes ma'am.

14:46.360 --> 14:50.227
Thanks to your god.
I'm an atheist.

14:51.487 --> 14:54.485
There's no hope for your soul on the final day,
when Gabriel blows his horn

14:54.567 --> 14:58.522
your ears will be deaf to the resounding
tone of its glory, Mr. Bierce.

14:58.807 --> 15:05.439
Oh, no. On the contrary, when Gabriel
blows his horn, I'd be playing the tuba.

15:06.807 --> 15:11.244
It won't feel us bad, Mary. Mr. Bierce
is entitled to his beliefs so deeply.

15:11.807 --> 15:13.537
How generous!

15:15.247 --> 15:18.606
- So why are you here, Mr. Bierce?
- I have an ambassador good will.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.478
All right. And an ambassador to whom?

15:21.987 --> 15:25.399
General Fransico Vien.

15:26.067 --> 15:29.758
- The...the revolutionary?
- One and the same.

15:30.127 --> 15:32.456
And I meet him tomorrow in Tierra
Negra. I'm in charged with the

15:32.527 --> 15:35.885
duty to transport somthing
of incredible value to him.

15:37.347 --> 15:38.277
- What is it?

15:38.327 --> 15:42.095
I'm afraid of if I shared this
information with you madam,

15:42.267 --> 15:47.276
It would be forced to take your life and
I wouldn't want that on my conscience.

15:51.647 --> 15:54.743
He is joking honey,
he is joking.

16:36.607 --> 16:37.918
Johnny!

16:41.587 --> 16:43.205
Where where you, Mickey?

16:44.367 --> 16:47.805
I thought... we... Chato said...

16:47.867 --> 16:49.201
What did Chato say?!

16:51.267 --> 16:59.158
He said... he said... he said
that he was the new heffe.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.479
Where is Chato?

17:03.827 --> 17:05.266
Get him!

17:13.887 --> 17:17.484
All the things they say about you...
I don't believe them.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.357
Believe them.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.906
But you took me away. You have me.

17:24.047 --> 17:27.301
I thought you would keep them
shooting at me. But I was wrong.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.716
- Where would we go?
- Say that again!

17:30.327 --> 17:33.147
- Where would we go?
- What do you mean, 'we'?

17:33.197 --> 17:37.085
- You got that way, and I go this way.
- But you... - No more words!

17:42.247 --> 17:43.996
You can hit me if you want!

17:45.287 --> 17:46.816
Yeah, turn around!

18:24.887 --> 18:26.596
Keep smearing harm.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.258
- Don't you have any relatives
you can go to? - No.

18:32.727 --> 18:35.876
- What about your mother?
- She died when I was born.

18:37.047 --> 18:41.854
My father told it I stole my
first breath from her last one.

18:43.567 --> 18:46.165
You can ride with me to Tierra Negra.
I know someone there.

18:46.227 --> 18:49.978
- He can set you up with some food and work.
- What kind of work?

18:50.467 --> 18:52.719
Kind of work girls do.

18:53.087 --> 18:57.606
- I don't think I'm that kind of girl.
- All girls are that kind of girl.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.721
Well, about two hours or so.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.783
They headed east.

19:53.247 --> 19:55.753
Go back to town find all the men you can.
Tell them I pay 100 pesos 

19:55.754 --> 19:59.990
who ever brings
Esmeralda back to me alive.

20:23.327 --> 20:27.036
Are you talking to me?
Are you really talking to me?

20:44.807 --> 20:48.138
- What's this?
- I don't mean any harm, all right?

20:50.567 --> 20:52.276
I want to be your prenis.

20:58.287 --> 21:04.118
Look! My doors swing only one way: OUT!

21:04.287 --> 21:07.639
No no no...
It's a student! I want you to teach me!

21:08.207 --> 21:12.444
I want to be a real outlaw.
A legend like you.

21:13.207 --> 21:14.993
You want us to kill him for you?

21:21.247 --> 21:22.682
Kill her!

21:27.187 --> 21:31.077
I shot that thing clean off and
I will do the the same with your tereso!

21:31.447 --> 21:36.183
- You shot that rope?
- Take me on and let me learn!
I'm not gonna mess up.

21:37.127 --> 21:38.899
So you are proving.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.237
Mains Reece. When do we start?

21:44.807 --> 21:45.849
Lesson number one:
I ask questions and you answer them, ok? 

21:45.850 --> 21:49.439
Give me your gun!

21:52.207 --> 21:55.856
Lesson number two: never give your gun to nobody.

21:56.327 --> 21:59.961
- Lesson number three: we don't like gringos!
- I know a gringo we can hit!

22:00.967 --> 22:02.256
Talk!

22:02.487 --> 22:06.205
- An old man is carrying something to Pancho Villa
- What?

22:07.487 --> 22:10.980
- I...I don't know. It must be very valuable.
- She is lying!

22:11.007 --> 22:14.418
I sware to God! It could be guns
and it could be gold!

22:18.847 --> 22:20.684
Very good job.

22:22.927 --> 22:26.160
Very good job! But if
you are fucking with me

22:26.161 --> 22:30.166
you will be in a wooden box, understand?
Good for you!

22:57.607 --> 22:59.999
Mr. Bierce, you are sick!

23:03.487 --> 23:06.255
Now this is a sign to stop your drinking.

23:13.207 --> 23:17.382
They say when a man drinks, it develops certain powers.

23:17.447 --> 23:20.881
- What kind of powers?
- Cleurboids.

23:21.587 --> 23:23.198
Second sight.

23:23.327 --> 23:26.593
My wife is right, Mr. Bierce.
You'd better take care of yourself.

23:26.647 --> 23:32.915
This is a preservative, and I'm pickling
myself for your great beyond.

23:38.887 --> 23:40.401
What did he say exactly?

23:40.497 --> 23:43.581
He said he was carrying something for via.
Something that worths a lot.

23:44.647 --> 23:48.381
If you lie, you die, understand?

23:55.127 --> 23:58.482
This little difficult experition:
Who foots the bill?

23:58.547 --> 24:00.385
We don't have to listen to this.

24:01.367 --> 24:05.283
My father died recently, Mr. Bierce.
He left me a large sum of money,

24:05.347 --> 24:07.463
and I decided to use it for the low.

24:07.527 --> 24:12.797
Ah, so he not only gained a bride,
but a checkbook to in the bargon.

24:15.167 --> 24:18.486
You insinuate that I married
my wife for her money.

24:18.607 --> 24:20.482
We have scrooped with Mr. Bierce.

24:20.483 --> 24:23.323
Something you must have
lost if you ever had'em.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.803
With that shotgun, he is blind!

25:05.287 --> 25:08.842
- What the...  who is that?
- Bandits, no doubt.

25:11.207 --> 25:15.946
- Damn! They gonna rob us!
- Kill us too, most likely.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.777
Bastard!

25:52.547 --> 25:54.720
Joaquin, the driver!

26:25.987 --> 26:27.784
I got him!

26:45.947 --> 26:48.358
Mr. Bierce! Stop it!

26:58.247 --> 27:00.841
Stop it now!

27:14.007 --> 27:15.300
Move!

27:16.867 --> 27:19.365
- Which one of you shot me?!
- He.

27:21.927 --> 27:23.379
That's him!

27:30.567 --> 27:31.845
Thank you.

27:34.107 --> 27:35.604
Find the gold!

27:41.087 --> 27:43.392
Reece! Over there!

28:00.687 --> 28:06.239
- Look what you did to my friend, gringo.
- My liquor, give it back.

28:15.407 --> 28:20.438
- Mr. Bierce!
- That hurt, don't it, ha?

28:30.207 --> 28:34.806
- May I assist you or something...?
- What's the matter with you, ha?

28:42.367 --> 28:47.990
- We gonna get 50 pesos for that. Real silk.
- My wedding dress!

28:48.207 --> 28:52.581
The gold! I said find the gold!

29:04.447 --> 29:07.322
- Hey, Chefe!
- There's nothing secret...

29:07.887 --> 29:11.996
- What's in the box, senora?
- There are Bibles...
- I wasn't talking to you.

29:14.407 --> 29:17.479
There are Bibles for the
children of Tierra Negra.

29:17.747 --> 29:23.236
- A Biblia Santa.
- Where is the gold?
- I found something!

29:37.107 --> 29:41.997
- You said he had two cases of gold.
- No Madrid, I said that it could've been gold.

29:48.367 --> 29:51.857
You got something very valuable
for Villa. What is it?

29:51.999 --> 29:54.400
- Shoot me!
- No! Please!

29:55.067 --> 29:58.539
Go on! Squeeze the trigger.
You can do it.

29:58.787 --> 30:01.333
Just tell them what it is , 
Mr. Bierce!

30:01.334 --> 30:03.702
Let them take it,
it's not worth your life!

30:05.567 --> 30:08.577
- It's not worth your life.
- It is my life.

30:08.647 --> 30:16.257
- What? 
- It is me. I'm going to be a soldier in Villa...in the revolution.

30:23.327 --> 30:24.730
Crazy old gringo!

30:24.731 --> 30:28.363
What are we to take you, ha?
Look at you!

30:31.927 --> 30:36.285
- Let me kill him at once!
- Leave him alone! He is an honorable man.

30:47.547 --> 30:49.648
I'd like to thank you, Mr. Bierce.

30:49.649 --> 30:53.357
With all your provato you
nearly got us killed back there.

30:56.727 --> 31:01.485
- Don't you lay another finger on my husband!
- I'm sick of the sight of him.

31:01.547 --> 31:04.164
- You have no right to speak
like this! We are alive...

31:04.165 --> 31:06.080
- We are alive! What
are you living for?

31:06.247 --> 31:08.299
This sick, offending...

31:10.267 --> 31:13.300
John! Leave him alone! Get off of him!

31:17.267 --> 31:19.616
You still have simpathy for
him even after that?

31:19.807 --> 31:24.883
- I fault the sin and not the sinner John, he needs help.
- Bring on!

31:26.547 --> 31:28.195
- When do the lessons start?

31:28.196 --> 31:31.904
The lessons are all around you
all the time. Remember that.

31:32.167 --> 31:35.179
The earth, it's opened up for
you like a woman.

31:35.847 --> 31:39.883
- Was it hard to kill all those men?
- No it wasn't, was it Madrid?

31:40.427 --> 31:45.718
For an outlaw, it's easy. An outlaw
is ready to kill no matter what.

31:45.887 --> 31:49.102
Listen, tell me your technique.
You know, how you done it.

31:49.167 --> 31:54.090
Was it sneaking upon people or
did you do a run to their face?

31:54.107 --> 31:58.181
Madrid, how did you became
famous, like a legend?

31:58.207 --> 32:04.002
- Is that what you want? To be a legend?
- I want to be an outlaw. And that means famous.

32:04.147 --> 32:06.879
People know your name and
they're scared of it.

32:06.897 --> 32:09.358
They tell their children to watch out at night,
because you could coming

32:09.427 --> 32:12.143
at night and kill the in their cribs.

32:12.144 --> 32:15.961
Men fear you and women
scream at the sight of you.

32:16.127 --> 32:17.213
- That's what I want.
- Yeah? Is that what you think I am?

32:17.214 --> 32:20.937
- Of course that's what you are.

32:22.207 --> 32:26.765
You are a monster. You are lying to yourself
if you're  think you're any different.

32:41.427 --> 32:45.605
- John! Is something wrong?
- Wagon stuck.

32:46.367 --> 32:54.236
We're not gonna make it throgh the sand.
We walk a while. It'll be fine.

33:44.747 --> 33:46.793
I know you!

33:48.707 --> 33:53.564
- Why are we stopping? I don't like cementeries.
- This is for the kid.

33:54.327 --> 33:56.853
Reece! Do you want to be like me?

33:56.854 --> 34:02.976
This is what you learn. The secret for
becoming an outlaw, a legend, is fear.

34:03.247 --> 34:05.257
To make the people scared of you?

34:05.307 --> 34:09.585
The only way to know how to put fear into
someone else is for you to feel that fear.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.996
- Feel it and face it. Can you do that?
- Yeah, I can try.

34:13.167 --> 34:15.965
- Try?
- I mean yeah, I can do it.

34:31.687 --> 34:34.898
- What are you doing?
- What's the lesson number one?

34:35.367 --> 34:40.263
- You ask the questions.
- Get up on the cross! Move!

34:45.726 --> 34:49.366
- Put the noose around your neck.
- Johnny, I don't think...

34:49.427 --> 34:50.989
Do you want to learn, ha?
You want to be an outlaw, a legend. 

34:50.989 --> 34:56.237
You got to be able to step fear in the face!

34:56.327 --> 35:01.287
Smell it's breath and laugh.
If you can't do that...than forget it.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.878
- Johnny, please!
- Shut up!

35:17.407 --> 35:20.416
- Is that better?
- It isn't now.

35:20.587 --> 35:23.623
- Are you scared?
- No.
- Johnny!

35:27.387 --> 35:29.341
- How about now?
- Yes.

35:29.407 --> 35:33.701
- Do you feel that rope is
getting tighter around your neck?

35:33.702 --> 35:35.883
- Yes.
- Johnny! Stop it!

35:40.147 --> 35:42.999
- Do you think you must slip and fall?
- Yes.

35:43.127 --> 35:49.595
You feel like a horse's ass, ha?
Because that's what you look like; a horse's ass!

35:54.847 --> 35:59.319
Don't laugh at me! Don't laugh at me!

35:59.407 --> 36:03.317
You see, we're looking at you
and you don't look like a legend.

36:03.587 --> 36:09.379
- You look like...like... Joaquin,
what she looks like? - A horse's ass!

36:10.407 --> 36:14.183
- Don't fucking laugh at me!
- Johnny that's enough!

36:14.247 --> 36:20.307
- You can't kill her! She is a girl.
- She is an outlaw. And she'll die like an outlaw.

36:31.227 --> 36:36.496
You're on your way now, kid.
A little while, you'll be a legend.

36:38.187 --> 36:40.786
Esmeralda! Wait!

36:41.347 --> 36:42.030
- Come on!
- See we don't mean nothing you ask chefe, 

36:42.031 --> 36:48.724
you chase after her. 
We're going on to Tierra Negra.

37:45.187 --> 37:49.356
"La Tetilla del Diablo".
Now what does that mean?

37:49.627 --> 37:54.979
I believe I can translate that for you.
Welcome home, wearied pilgrims.

38:19.327 --> 38:20.979
Inkeeper!

39:05.047 --> 39:10.316
- We are closed.
- You speak English!

39:10.687 --> 39:15.843
- English, French Latin and Nahuatl.
- We'd like a room for the night, sir.

39:16.007 --> 39:18.919
- And I'd like some brandy.
- All night?

39:19.067 --> 39:20.896
- Yes.
- Uno peso.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.624
- Drink?
- Yeah, sure.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.839
Two glasses of milk, please.

39:36.127 --> 39:39.519
- Water, then.
- Tequila!

39:39.727 --> 39:43.282
That's my cure . 
Have two bottles of your finest, thank you.

39:47.347 --> 39:53.125
- I think we have some water in
the back. The kind with the bubbles?

39:53.126 --> 39:54.465
Yeah, I know.

39:54.527 --> 39:58.816
- Anything, please.
- Make yourselves comfortable.

39:58.527 --> 40:01.317
- We'll busy here for a couple of hours.
- Thank you.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.836
Esmeralda! Wait!

40:30.007 --> 40:32.739
What's the matter? You didn't
even know that kid.

40:32.807 --> 40:35.780
- She made you angry?
- She had the wrong idea about me.

40:36.287 --> 40:40.199
- What's gonna happen to me when I make you angry, ha?
- You don't make me angry.

40:41.007 --> 40:45.964
What if I say the wrong thing? Sometimes
I just looked at my father and he hit me.

40:47.167 --> 40:48.942
I'm sorry.

41:50.247 --> 41:54.644
- More?
- No. We'd like to see our rooms, please.

42:35.487 --> 42:41.284
I'm Quixsla. I'll show you to your room.

42:42.247 --> 42:46.025
- John Newlie.
- John.

42:48.207 --> 42:55.475
- And she is...
- My wife. Mrs. Mary Newlie.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.041
Hello.

43:17.107 --> 43:18.993
Madrid did this.

43:19.247 --> 43:23.581
He'll have to stop. They cannot ride
in the dark, there are coyotes out.

43:23.582 --> 43:26.490
The closest pueblo is another
half days journey.

43:27.347 --> 43:31.636
- There's no place to stop out here.
- There's one place.

43:33.467 --> 43:35.421
She is still alive!

43:37.947 --> 43:40.904
Kill him! Kill him!

43:44.227 --> 43:49.516
You have no idea what you've unleashed!
Bring her!

44:20.167 --> 44:22.383
I have a shot of your best.

44:26.247 --> 44:31.996
Damn lucky thing I found this place.
I saw a dead meandering in the dusk and dawn.

44:32.287 --> 44:36.699
I was wondering... which do you call
when someone looks real but it ain't?

44:36.967 --> 44:42.305
- A mirage.
- Yes sir, that's it, a mirage... the real thing.

44:48.127 --> 44:52.503
Uh, that's good, yeah, it'a real good.
I think I have another one.

44:52.567 --> 44:54.816
Pay for the first one.

45:01.287 --> 45:06.602
You know...I ain't got damn money... but I do
have some much better than that.

45:11.767 --> 45:16.263
- It's a brush!
- Well, yeah, technically speaking it's a brush,

45:16.327 --> 45:23.405
but this brush was made by the finest Andalusian
group, bristles handpicked by Andalusian gypsies

45:23.567 --> 45:29.477
straight of the mane of Andalusian
horses, going into far of Andalusia.

45:32.707 --> 45:35.221
- We don't need no stinking brushes!

45:35.387 --> 45:38.940
I'll stand the pedlar to a drink.

45:55.007 --> 45:57.482
Still ain't interested in the brush?

46:37.367 --> 46:39.381
That's occupied.

46:46.507 --> 46:48.986
This will be your room.

47:02.647 --> 47:06.756
Call me... if you need anything.

47:06.827 --> 47:10.498
Excuse me madam, what time
can we expect supper?

47:11.267 --> 47:19.663
We eat late around here. But don't
worry, I let you know when it's time.

47:27.267 --> 47:31.717
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes, I'm fine.

47:35.387 --> 47:38.203
- Need anything?
- Nop, nothing.

47:59.667 --> 48:01.496
Ah, John!

48:02.367 --> 48:06.106
We've been married a week, Mary.
And I still don't know

48:06.107 --> 48:08.443
What you look like in a bed dress.

48:09.107 --> 48:12.585
John, I just hope that you have better
reasons for marriage than that.

48:12.647 --> 48:18.804
You know I do! I love you, Mary.
It's not a sin if you married in love.

48:19.367 --> 48:24.685
I'm not refusing you because I think it's a sin.
It's just that...that...

48:40.767 --> 48:46.604
It's a bat. Just a bat. Tried to
find some shade from the heat.

48:47.807 --> 48:52.320
- Are you sure you all right?
- I feel sick.

48:53.107 --> 48:57.239
I just want to go to bed.
Could you possibly get me some water?

48:58.007 --> 49:00.762
All right Mary, I  get you some water.

49:03.227 --> 49:04.898
I'll be back.

49:16.667 --> 49:18.704
Son of a bitch!

49:35.407 --> 49:37.643
- Are you looking for something?

49:39.107 --> 49:42.319
No I... I dropped something.

49:51.867 --> 49:54.756
Maybe it's in here.

50:37.727 --> 50:45.244
You like the dress? You want it?
You can have it. For 50 pesos!

51:05.667 --> 51:07.400
Here are a lot of ladies.

51:09.327 --> 51:12.856
There's a lot of dirt down here, in Mexico,
I make a kill instead of brushes and boom,

51:12.927 --> 51:18.865
but Tierra Negra was my last hope, if I
don't sell last it's back home for me.

51:22.127 --> 51:26.582
We begged a ticket up in threed, barter system
or something if you get my drift listed.

51:28.147 --> 51:31.405
- Sorry mister, I ain't asked your name.
- Bierce, Ambrose.

51:31.527 --> 51:34.119
- Ambrose Bierce you, right?
- Yes.

51:35.487 --> 51:38.281
- That don't be true.
- You know my work?

51:38.327 --> 51:42.303
Yes sir, I do.
I did read...let me see...

51:42.767 --> 51:46.186
The story with that soldier up
on that bridge set to be hanged,

51:46.187 --> 51:48.323
and he escapes far into the river below

51:48.407 --> 51:53.146
He swam, he swam he swam, ran to his
house and kiss his wife,

51:53.207 --> 51:59.995
snap, his neck broke and all went to dream.
It's a got damn dream. That'd just kill me.

52:08.547 --> 52:11.578
Excuse me! Drink!

52:14.287 --> 52:16.365
- Water?

52:16.407 --> 52:18.719
- No. Tequila.

52:33.127 --> 52:34.990
Keep it coming!

52:35.127 --> 52:38.995
My name is Newlie. John Newlie.
I like your friend.

53:06.487 --> 53:11.917
Never seen this place before. I must've
ridden through here a thousand times.

53:21.197 --> 53:23.845
You are very pretty, senorita.

53:25.207 --> 53:29.501
- Go inside. I take your horses.
- Yeah, you'd better do that.

53:36.767 --> 53:40.262
Go on! I'm gonna make sure that
the horses are taken care of.

53:40.327 --> 53:44.996
We don't want to get stuck here. I'll be right back.

54:11.507 --> 54:13.490
You're alone?

54:17.867 --> 54:20.079
- Who hurt you?

54:22.147 --> 54:33.305
- The scars on your back. Your husband?
- No. My father.

55:05.167 --> 55:08.643
You sweet child.

55:15.287 --> 55:21.681
It's tears, have never fallen on the mother's breast.

55:25.527 --> 55:30.906
- You are very special... Esmeralda.

55:33.807 --> 55:36.204
- How do you know my name?

55:51.207 --> 55:54.320
Hey idiot! Where are you?

56:19.627 --> 56:22.500
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing, senior.

56:22.787 --> 56:25.399
- Get away from my horse!
- Si, senior.

56:31.367 --> 56:33.479
John!

57:07.027 --> 57:10.802
Well, well. Remember me?

57:19.999 --> 57:22.337
- Where's the girl?
- Which one?

57:22.447 --> 57:26.342
I mean a specified girl. The one that
just came in here. Where's she?

57:35.487 --> 57:40.897
Hey! Where's the girl? I'm talking to you!

58:12.267 --> 58:15.405
So what's your policy on fighting
in this establishment?

58:15.667 --> 58:17.622
I don't care. What do you have in mind?

58:17.787 --> 58:22.947
I'm talking about real ass-kicking; broken arms,
smashed nose shattered jaw, that's what I think.

58:22.999 --> 58:25.320
I've seen worse, senior.

58:26.997 --> 58:29.926
- Tequila!
- Si, senior.

58:38.727 --> 58:42.220
- What do I owe you?
- Jetted jaw right here!

59:02.887 --> 59:04.796
Please, senior...

59:16.487 --> 59:18.818
- Esmeralda, we're leaving!
- I want to stay!

59:18.987 --> 59:20.957
This is not the time to fuck around!

59:21.067 --> 59:25.479
- She said she's staying.
- I'm not talking to you!

59:28.807 --> 59:33.883
- Get out of the way or I blow you an extra hole!
- Go ahead!

59:49.187 --> 59:54.321
- John!
- Let him go, or I fix your little bitch, cabron!

01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:07.163
You're next, asshole!

01:00:15.747 --> 01:00:17.236
John!

01:00:37.827 --> 01:00:39.799
John, stop it!

01:00:59.187 --> 01:01:01.463
- Something wrong?
- What's the matter with this place?

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:05.497
- Your stupid friend ate my horse! I had to shoot him.
- You mean Nano?

01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:23.460
I know what you look like Madrid:
you look like the horse's ass!

01:01:23.587 --> 01:01:24.923
Esmeralda!

01:01:33.987 --> 01:01:35.540
- Mary!
- John!

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:55.158
I'm walking out of here,
and I'm taking Esmeralda with me!

01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:57.900
You've taken far enough, Madrid.
You don't know what you're getting into!

01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:00.986
Give her back to me now, and I let you live!

01:02:01.047 --> 01:02:02.860
You're not going anywhere! You stay with me!

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:08.441
Well Mauricio, it's been a long  time.
But I knew you come back.

01:02:10.107 --> 01:02:11.904
Stay away from me!

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:18.237
The girl is beautiful.
She does really look like you.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:22.775
- Stay away from me!
- But she looks a lot like me!

01:02:33.447 --> 01:02:39.114
Hey Mauricio! After all these years
where've you been, amigo?

01:02:39.115 --> 01:02:41.992
You're just in time for dinner!

01:03:02.507 --> 01:03:04.404
Fuck!

01:03:35.287 --> 01:03:36.877
Oh Jesus!

01:04:22.207 --> 01:04:25.991
Mauricio! That wasn't very nice!

01:04:52.327 --> 01:04:54.361
Let's get out of here!

01:05:15.527 --> 01:05:17.540
Let's go honey! Let's go!

01:05:26.647 --> 01:05:27.990
Back!

01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:44.740
Mary! Mary!

01:05:45.127 --> 01:05:46.997
Cabron!

01:05:53.847 --> 01:05:55.990
John help me! John!

01:06:15.867 --> 01:06:17.997
Get a dance!

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:21.998
Mary!

01:07:09.827 --> 01:07:11.962
Mary!

01:07:12.227 --> 01:07:14.437
Mary!

01:07:20.187 --> 01:07:22.319
Mary! No!

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:27.197
Down here!

01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:50.498
Go! Go! Move back! Move back!

01:07:50.827 --> 01:07:52.999
Shut the door! Shut the door!

01:07:54.427 --> 01:07:57.925
- Because of you they took my wife!
- They should have taken you, pendejo!

01:07:57.987 --> 01:07:59.822
That's enough!

01:08:00.487 --> 01:08:02.586
No it isn't!

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:07.958
- I said that's enough!
- It's none of your business, gringo!
He put my daughter into this area.

01:08:07.987 --> 01:08:11.683
Everyone here has a score dissent.
And if we were in anywhere else,

01:08:11.907 --> 01:08:19.167
I wouldn't give too annal explosions if you blew
your stinking brains into a flatulented wink.

01:08:19.367 --> 01:08:26.636
But from now on the bets are off.
Am I clear? Am I clear!?

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:34.999
It's her they want.
Till we have her we have a chance.

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:38.816
- My daughter is not for sale!
- Did I say that?

01:08:41.027 --> 01:08:43.484
Let's find another way out.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:51.259
- You'd better watch your back, hangman.
- Watch yours.

01:09:06.997 --> 01:09:09.437
Get up! Get up!

01:09:16.407 --> 01:09:19.997
Wait! They're gone!

01:09:21.006 --> 01:09:23.992
- Esmeralda!
- There's something in my hair!

01:10:17.867 --> 01:10:19.995
Where's my girl?

01:10:20.707 --> 01:10:26.844
You must find her.
You have to taste what I've tasted.

01:10:41.807 --> 01:10:44.317
She has arrived!

01:10:44.997 --> 01:10:47.997
Wake the old one!

01:11:28.587 --> 01:11:30.919
John!

01:11:39.187 --> 01:11:41.377
John!

01:11:52.247 --> 01:11:54.597
My Lord in heaven!

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:58.781
John! How could you leave me up there?

01:11:59.047 --> 01:12:01.525
I'm your wife, John!

01:12:03.287 --> 01:12:05.722
They hurt me!

01:12:05.887 --> 01:12:11.176
- Mary!
- This is not your wife, Newlie.
- Shut your mouth, Bierce!

01:12:15.547 --> 01:12:19.802
He is no servant of God!
He talkes a good game.

01:12:20.267 --> 01:12:23.465
But deep down he is a sinner!
Child of Sodom!

01:12:24.027 --> 01:12:24.772
- Stop it!

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:29.762
Send her to the hell, she is so formerly
feared when in sermon.

01:12:30.627 --> 01:12:37.347
Now what kind of preacher would
defy his god so blasphemously!?

01:12:39.207 --> 01:12:42.336
The game is up you cocksucker!

01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:48.162
All this time, you've been selling
your sale as a devoted believer!

01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:52.836
Now you are as a sinful thief!
You counted me what for?

01:12:52.997 --> 01:12:56.682
oh you really wanted to do
was to take my father's money.

01:12:57.287 --> 01:12:59.990
Blasphemour!

01:13:01.847 --> 01:13:03.960
Fucking pendejo!

01:13:05.107 --> 01:13:09.856
You always wanted to see what was
underneath this dress, didn't you?

01:13:15.507 --> 01:13:19.406
Help me! Help me!

01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:37.945
John, how could you?

01:13:38.307 --> 01:13:40.585
Forgive me!

01:13:43.547 --> 01:13:45.996
<:She is the princess:>

01:13:55.787 --> 01:13:58.622
Was anyone else beaten back there?

01:13:58.887 --> 01:14:01.463
- No I wasn't.
- No, not me.

01:14:18.927 --> 01:14:20.458
No.

01:14:20.567 --> 01:14:26.458
Everybody's fine? All right then,
we're safe. Let's move on.

01:14:26.927 --> 01:14:29.779
Make god forgive and help all of us.

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:47.993
Here feels colder.

01:14:50.827 --> 01:14:53.598
Nightair.

01:14:53.807 --> 01:14:55.899
This must be the way out.

01:14:56.067 --> 01:14:58.721
Could be that way, could be this way, idiot!

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:04.162
We will separate.
Take our chances.

01:15:04.387 --> 01:15:08.741
You! You take the girl,
your friend, and the believer.

01:15:08.907 --> 01:15:14.755
I take the hangman and the kid.
And try not to kill each other!

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:29.592
God forgotten about you, Reece.

01:15:29.887 --> 01:15:36.300
- Reece. Katherine Reece. - No.
- You're wanted for murder in two states I believe.

01:15:36.967 --> 01:15:38.522
See you read papers.

01:15:38.687 --> 01:15:43.202
I'm a journalist. She sent her
entire family to the great beyond.

01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:46.925
Killed them in cold blood in Oklahoma.
Then went on to Texas,

01:15:46.997 --> 01:15:52.241
where she proferred the same gift to
her aunt, her unkle and five cousins.

01:15:52.527 --> 01:15:55.993
- Six.
- Oh, six. Pardon me.

01:15:56.307 --> 01:15:59.301
You killed your mother and father? Why?

01:15:59.787 --> 01:16:03.937
They were starving, there's no food.
So I sent them to a better place.

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:07.884
What about your aunt and
unkle and all your cousins?

01:16:08.927 --> 01:16:11.696
I never liked them.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:48.016
What the fuck are you looking at, pendejo?

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:07.763
Trouble! Hey! Where's your friend?

01:17:08.997 --> 01:17:10.903
Joaquin!

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:15.796
Quit fucking around, Joaquin! Joaquin!

01:17:18.827 --> 01:17:20.916
Joaquin!

01:17:51.287 --> 01:17:56.485
You made me one of them!
You turned me into one of those things!

01:17:59.947 --> 01:18:03.106
What? What are you gonna do?

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:17.946
- Do it for turning!
- God have mercy in your soul, compadre.

01:18:33.307 --> 01:18:35.758
What's going on? Where are the others?

01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:39.387
- Dead.
- Dead? Why not you?

01:18:39.767 --> 01:18:42.359
Maybe you are one of them. A bloodsucker.

01:18:42.487 --> 01:18:45.879
You know about bloodsucking, wouldn't you?

01:18:47.247 --> 01:18:49.791
What's that supposed to mean?

01:18:49.907 --> 01:18:53.565
... the girl... the princess...

01:18:53.627 --> 01:18:56.996
Pappy! Why do they want me? Who am I?

01:18:57.047 --> 01:18:58.701
Why don't you tell her?

01:18:58.827 --> 01:19:00.322
What are you talking about?

01:19:00.587 --> 01:19:03.879
Tell her who her mother is. Tell her!

01:19:08.967 --> 01:19:11.773
If you cannot succeed
in killing one another

01:19:11.774 --> 01:19:15.140
I release you so could do
it upon that god damn door!

01:19:25.607 --> 01:19:29.823
Come! There's somebody that I want you to meet.

01:20:13.887 --> 01:20:18.996
This is your grandmother.
Welcome home Santánico.

01:20:20.227 --> 01:20:25.925
- Prepare these sacrifices for the annuity.
- Nooo!

01:20:29.887 --> 01:20:33.905
It's really quite an extraordinarily,
compromising position.

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.443
What are they fixing to do with us?

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.200
Lead us dry.

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.980
Hangman, your past has come back to haunt us.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:54.360
I tried to do the best I could.
I raised her in my own home for 19 years.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.560
And I beat her so she
would never disobey me.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.860
I never thought she would come
back to her mother.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:07.960
The old woman... she predicted this;
Esmeralda would return to Tetilla des Diablo.

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:13.300
As only she was kept from this place she
said she would remain a human, just a girl.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.960
Coming here she becomes something else.

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:35.980
- You should've kill her.
- I tried... she was a child. But she kept coming back.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.940
We taste of your blood that
we join us Santànico Pandemonium.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.240
Psst! Hangman!

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.960
Welcome to the darkness Santanico Pandemonium!

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.520
Send her to her rest!

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.900
I'm here, pappy!

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.990
I'm home, pappy.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:24.840
No. I raised you, not your mother! I raised you!

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.720
- I know, pappy.
- I never wanted to punish you.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.740
I know. Pappy! I love you!

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.990
Out of here!

01:24:59.999 --> 01:25:02.900
Johnny wait!

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.860
Get away from me.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.520
But you brought me here.
To the place I belong. It's safe here.

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:13.220
What are you talking about, Esmeralda!?

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.980
She is not Esmeralda!

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.120
She is Santanico!

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.200
Bitch!

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:11.940
Johnny! Don't leave me! Johnny!

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.920
Hey! What are you gonna do now?

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.000
What I came here to do.

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.560
Hey!

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.540
Do you need company?

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.120
Not particulary, no.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.480
But Villa might.
