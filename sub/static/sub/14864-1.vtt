01:44.981 --> 01:49.315
400 years after the last king
was driven from the city,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.150
the republic of Rome rules many nations,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.771
but cannot rule itself.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.195
The city is constantly roiled by conflict

01:58.327 --> 02:02.070
between the common people
and the nobility.

02:02.206 --> 02:07.371
Power is shared and order maintained
by two soldiers, old friends,

02:07.503 --> 02:11.837
Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
and Gaius Julius Caesar.

02:11.966 --> 02:15.925
Once, Pompey was acknowledged
by all to be the greater man,

02:16.053 --> 02:20.046
but for the last eight years,
while Pompey has kept the peace in Rome,

02:20.182 --> 02:23.140
Caesar has waged a war of conquest in Gaul

02:23.269 --> 02:26.432
that has made him
ever more rich and popular.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.555
The balance of power is shifting,

02:28.691 --> 02:30.898
and the nobility have grown fearful.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.109
Though of noble blood himself,

02:33.237 --> 02:35.603
Caesar stands with the common people.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.105
A man like that,

02:37.241 --> 02:41.860
an aristocrat with soldiers,
money and the love of the people,

02:41.996 --> 02:44.078
might make himself king.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.974
Pullo, formation!

03:49.188 --> 03:52.772
Pullo! Single formation!

03:55.611 --> 03:57.602
Shields on me!

04:12.837 --> 04:15.954
Get back in formation, you drunken fool.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.136
Reform!

04:28.185 --> 04:33.350
Legionary Titus Pullo is a hero
of the 13th legion, but look at him now.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.815
Justice knows every man's number.

04:36.944 --> 04:40.152
He has committed a terrible sacrilege,

04:40.281 --> 04:42.738
and he will pay for it with his life!

04:42.867 --> 04:46.530
As will any man here who breaks the law.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.454
Brawlers and drunkards will be flogged.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.791
Thieves will be strangled.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.377
Deserters will be crucified.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.755
Is that it?

05:07.892 --> 05:10.508
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.065
Before you...

05:26.202 --> 05:29.239
Vercingetorix, son of Celtil,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.953
chieftain of the tribe of the Arverni,

05:32.082 --> 05:35.415
commander of the rebel stronghold of Alesia,

05:35.544 --> 05:37.705
king of all the Gauls.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.997
What would you have of him?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.727
Caesar!

06:28.389 --> 06:32.098
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

06:33.185 --> 06:35.267
Hey, here!

06:37.106 --> 06:40.098
You piss—drinking sons of circus whores!

06:40.234 --> 06:43.146
The chief of the Gauls
has surrendered to Caesar.

06:43.279 --> 06:45.361
The war is over.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.985
Don't say that.

06:49.118 --> 06:53.657
The boys have been given two days' liberty
to sack the town and take personal spoils.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.996
They'll all be rich.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.286
And me in here!

06:58.419 --> 06:59.579
Hey!

07:04.800 --> 07:06.006
Come on, get in there!

07:07.136 --> 07:09.548
400 denarii? Are you insane?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.090
That's a floor price.

07:11.223 --> 07:16.183
We'll pay the usual premium for
tradesmen and fertile women, et cetera.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.138
Set the floor closer to eight.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.188
"My dear friend and partner, Gaius,

07:28.324 --> 07:30.610
"l have terrible news."

07:30.743 --> 07:33.155
Forgive me.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.694
Forgive me.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.823
I forgive you. I forgive you.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.377
— Be good to my slaves.
— I will.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.542
— And to my father.
— I will.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.013
Kiss me.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.523
Your hair.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.151
Funny.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.248
This isn't miserable Eastern peasantry.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.421
This is the creme of the Gallic nations.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.680
A glut on the market.
You can't give them away.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.422
— Seven and be done with it.
- On delivery to Massilia?

08:36.558 --> 08:40.176
- Oh, please!
— Agreed. See to the details.

08:41.897 --> 08:45.014
I hope you got a decent price
off those parasites.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.152
Good enough.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.907
News from Rome?

08:56.078 --> 08:58.694
Pompey writes.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.790
My daughter Julia has died in childbirth.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.134
l grieve with you.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.599
The child?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.723
A girl, stillborn.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.657
Pompey will be needing a new wife.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.951
Caesar!

09:50.674 --> 09:54.337
More of Caesar's spoils from Gaul.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.804
Caesar!

10:28.086 --> 10:30.543
What a dreadful noise plebs make
when they're happy.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.163
This is music.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.259
Wait until Caesar starts them
howling for our blood.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.127
Then you'll hear something dreadful.

11:27.563 --> 11:31.852
A fine reward is offered
for the return of a slave woman,

11:31.984 --> 11:34.475
stolen or absconded

11:34.611 --> 11:37.523
from the house of Marius Dolabella.

11:38.991 --> 11:43.405
Under the protection of Pompey Magnus
and Julius Caesar,

11:43.537 --> 11:45.869
Senate sits tomorrow.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.579
Be aware!

11:47.708 --> 11:50.415
No disorder will be tolerated.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.912
Yes,
they come from a Palmerian source.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.123
That was lovely, Timon.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.371
Two stallions have come to Rome today.

12:40.302 --> 12:44.466
Of course. How childish of me.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.089
— You want the horse.
— I do.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.683
But don't be sullen now.
This was not a hardship for me.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.349
I've always found something perversely erotic

12:53.482 --> 12:55.598
about goaty little men.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.076
Do please don't lurk, Octavian. Come in.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.454
Don't be a goose. Come in.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.099
— I've bought a horse.
- Have you?

13:31.228 --> 13:35.062
The best horse in Rome, by all accounts.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.523
— I'm very happy for you.
— It's a gift for your great—uncle.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.893
I want you to take the animal to Gaul

13:41.029 --> 13:43.190
and give it to him in person.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.944
— Why?
— When he's back,

13:47.077 --> 13:49.944
everyone will give him gifts.
We must be first.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.914
He won't return to Rome soon.
The Senate's hostility will prevent him.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.375
- Legally speaking...
— Please don't start speaking legally.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.916
- You know it bores me.
— It's a long way to Gaul.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.255
Exactly. While yet a mere boy,

14:02.384 --> 14:05.421
you would risk your life
to honour your beloved great—uncle.

14:05.554 --> 14:09.342
You ride into Caesar's camp alone,
on a noble white stallion.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.261
— That's a gift he won't soon forget.
— Alone?

14:12.394 --> 14:16.512
Well, you'll have plenty of slaves.
You'll be perfectly safe.

14:17.107 --> 14:20.895
And you'll make your mama
very proud and happy.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.235
Cato, the Senate hears you.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.828
Pompey Magnus...

14:33.957 --> 14:37.290
l have a question concerning
your friend and co-consul,

14:37.419 --> 14:41.253
the darling of Venus, Gaius Julius Caesar.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.542
Why does his chair remain empty?

14:43.675 --> 14:46.883
Why does he not come home?
His illegal war is over.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.678
Gaul is long since on its knees.

14:51.767 --> 14:54.679
Why does Caesar keep his brave soldiers

14:54.811 --> 14:57.302
from their families and friends?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.099
For eight long years,

15:03.236 --> 15:07.104
he has gorged himself like a wolf
on the blood of Gaul,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.902
and thereby made himself monstrously rich.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.488
- Why?
— Sit down!

15:12.621 --> 15:16.864
Why does he ply the mob
with races and fights and gaudy feasts?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.366
Why has he paid the debts

15:19.503 --> 15:23.872
of every reprobate fool in this Senate house?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.247
Why?

15:28.804 --> 15:31.420
I'll tell you why he does these things.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.421
He wants to buy himself a crown.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.720
He wants to destroy the Republic

15:36.853 --> 15:39.765
and rule Rome as a bloody tyrant!

15:39.898 --> 15:41.980
That's why!

15:46.988 --> 15:49.604
Therefore, I move

15:49.741 --> 15:53.529
that Caesar's governorship
in Gaul be terminated immediately,

15:53.662 --> 15:56.699
that his armies be disbanded
and that he be recalled to Rome

15:56.832 --> 16:02.953
to answer charges of illegal warfare,
theft, bribery and treason!

16:14.808 --> 16:16.514
Very good, Cato.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.510
Full of vim and verve, as usual.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.223
Caesar has been generous to the people

16:24.359 --> 16:27.226
because he loves the people as I do.

16:29.948 --> 16:33.907
It is the people that rule,
not you fine noblemen.

16:34.035 --> 16:38.244
It is Pompey's soldiers that rule,
not we fine noblemen.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.412
I'm going to save us all hours
of useless clamour

16:42.544 --> 16:45.661
and use my consular veto on your motion.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.755
- Yes!
— I do not...

16:48.884 --> 16:51.466
— I do not...
— Silence!

16:53.805 --> 16:56.797
Are we children? Let the consul speak.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.434
Thank you, Cicero.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.346
— I do not...
— However...

17:00.478 --> 17:03.094
if I might say a few words before you continue.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.975
When confronted by a hungry wolf,

17:09.112 --> 17:13.651
it is unwise to goad the beast,
as Cato would have us do.

17:13.783 --> 17:17.321
But it is equally unwise

17:17.454 --> 17:20.412
to imagine the snarling animal a friend

17:20.540 --> 17:23.247
and offer your hand as Pompey does.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.288
Perhaps you would have us climb a tree.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.797
Caesar is my brother by sacred oath.

17:34.930 --> 17:40.721
I know his heart. He is my friend
and a faithful son of the Republic.

17:40.852 --> 17:45.266
And until anyone proves that he is not,
I will never betray him.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.715
Pompey Magnus,
my dear fellow, you're well met.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.004
Scipio, Cato.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.514
I would not take you for lovers of the mime.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.508
You know my daughter, Cornelia.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.431
Widow of noble Publius who died at Carrhae.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.397
Cornelia, your husband was a fine Roman.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.107
I thank you.

18:32.862 --> 18:37.731
Father, my presence is not appropriate.
There's a lewd woman on the stage.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.985
I had no notion. We will not linger, then.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.329
Pompey, a pleasant good night.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.287
If it please you, might we speak alone?

18:55.677 --> 19:00.262
Neither we aristocrats alone nor you
and your soldiers alone can crush Caesar.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.848
— Stop there.
— I do not say that you wish to crush Caesar,

19:03.977 --> 19:06.935
| only say that if you did wish it,
you could not do it alone.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.055
l have no need of you noble gentlemen.

19:10.191 --> 19:15.311
l have only to stamp my feet
and legions will spring up all over ltaly.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.732
I can squash Caesar like an insect
if I wished it so.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.700
I do not wish it.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.947
Renounce him, Pompey! Renounce Caesar!

19:27.083 --> 19:31.042
A||y yourself with us
and his strength will wither away.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.503
It is you who has the real power.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.338
It is you the people truly love.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.424
Will they still shout Caesar's name

19:38.553 --> 19:41.215
when he runs out of Gallic trinkets
to throw to them?

19:41.348 --> 19:45.091
Think you I care what names
are shouted in the streets?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.387
Nothing is more important.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.272
You ask me to openly betray a friend.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.983
I cannot do it. Good night.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.633
Oh, silly baby brother.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.479
Everything will be all right.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.031
Is he not perfect? Proper little soldier.

20:43.159 --> 20:46.526
- He's scared.
— Nonsense. Roman men are never scared.

20:46.663 --> 20:50.531
He'sjust sad to be leaving his mama.
You're not scared, are you, Octavian?

20:50.667 --> 20:54.000
Of course you're not.
Time flies. Give me a kiss, my love.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.756
Andros...

21:00.885 --> 21:05.254
Bring him back safe or
I'll use the eyes of your children for beads.

21:29.205 --> 21:33.995
Lyco, the horse. Not too expensive, I hope.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.085
I'm sorry, sir, the horse was sold already.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.545
— To Atia of the Julii.
- Atia?

21:39.674 --> 21:42.211
She's sending it to Gaul.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.674
A gift for Caesar.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.058
Damn him!

21:52.187 --> 21:54.303
Must he have everything?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.974
As you were going to be in Gaul anyway,

22:01.112 --> 22:04.024
I might kill two birds with one stone.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.290
— Let me look at you.
— As ugly as ever, I'm afraid.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.789
Not at all. Age suits you, Brutus.

23:46.426 --> 23:50.169
— How long has it been? Five years?
— No, six.

23:50.305 --> 23:52.421
Oh, how clever.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.639
It's almost like a proper house.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.478
I deeply regret your loss.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.645
Julia and so forth. Horrible business.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.859
Condolences, really.

24:10.033 --> 24:13.867
— Now tell me, how's your mother?
— The same as ever.

24:13.995 --> 24:18.079
She sends her love, demands to know
why you haven't written to her in months.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.584
I can remedy that if you'll be my courier.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.452
l have several letters to send to her.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.375
If I can bring myself to get on another horse.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.372
I had no conception that Gaul was so far.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.091
Brutus, me old cock!

24:31.220 --> 24:34.428
— What on earth are you doing here?
— Mark Antony, how nice.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.798
I've been visiting my cousin in Narbo.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.845
How is that idiot cousin of yours?

24:38.978 --> 24:42.220
— He was...
— Actually, I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.

24:42.357 --> 24:45.224
I need, say, a half talent of gold.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.227
- Do you?
— See how he trusts me.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.979
— For the eagle.
— Of course. Strabo!

24:52.116 --> 24:55.199
Give his honour Mark Antony
a half talent of gold.

24:55.328 --> 24:58.570
— A half talent of gold.
— And not a penny more.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.367
Dominus.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.211
I don't know how you tolerate that man.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.955
He likes to fight.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.959
The way he carries on
is as if he came from no family at all.

25:12.095 --> 25:16.429
He does have a vulgarian streak.
I don't mind it.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.048
What is this about the eagle?

25:22.605 --> 25:27.520
My personal standard was stolen by brigands.
A bad business.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.610
The legions were already homesick and surly.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.899
Now they're positively mutinous.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.023
The men think it's a sure sign of my doom,

25:35.159 --> 25:38.026
and they're clamouring like geese
for disbandment.

25:38.162 --> 25:41.120
They did not seem so unhappy.

25:41.249 --> 25:44.457
They never flaunt their discontent.
Gets them whipped.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.666
| tell you, Brutus, I'm at my wits' end.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.184
Master Octavian...

26:09.902 --> 26:11.438
Vasio is only a few more miles.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.153
Do not touch me without permission.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.985
Water.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.488
Lucius Vorenus.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.948
You have a brain.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.699
So the tribunes say.

27:07.835 --> 27:12.044
So tell me, if it were you
who had to retrieve Caesar's eagle,

27:12.173 --> 27:13.913
how would you go about it?

27:14.509 --> 27:17.876
I'd take captives from every tribe in Gaul

27:18.012 --> 27:21.880
and crucify them one by one
until someone tells me where the eagle is.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.849
Then, I would go in quick and quiet
with one or two men

27:24.977 --> 27:27.138
and steal it back.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.978
Good. We are of one mind.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.018
- Do it.
— Do it, sir?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.733
There's a torture detachment with the third,

27:34.862 --> 27:37.319
but you may choose your own men if you wish.

27:44.497 --> 27:47.660
There's a quarter talent there,
for bribes and such.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.875
— Spend it wisely.
— Sir.

28:02.139 --> 28:06.849
No! No! Please let me down!

28:06.978 --> 28:09.811
Let me down!

28:13.234 --> 28:16.271
Let me down!
| know...| know where the eagle is.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.611
- Speak.
— The Blue Spaniards,

28:18.739 --> 28:23.733
they came to stay for one night...
and then rode to the Cadurci lands.

28:23.870 --> 28:27.283
Please! Please, please. Let me down.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.077
The Cadurci.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.833
Fortune pisses on me.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.578
— Please let me down!
- Take them down.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.958
Forculus,

28:41.095 --> 28:45.338
if you be the right god
for the business here, I call on you to help me.

28:45.474 --> 28:50.138
If you will open this door,
then I will kill for you a fine white lamb,

28:50.271 --> 28:54.810
or, failing that, if I couldn't get
a good one at a decent price, then six pigeons.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.853
This, Forculus, lvow to you.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.352
Legionary Titus Pullo, stand up.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.157
— Why's he here?
— You are released

29:09.290 --> 29:12.578
to the command of
Second Spear Centurion Lucius Vorenus.

29:12.710 --> 29:15.793
Do your duty and
you'll be spared damnation in the arena.

29:15.922 --> 29:20.541
I won't stand next to this short—arsed shit,
let alone serve him. I'll stay here, thanks.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.418
These orders are from
his excellency Mark Antony.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.216
You are to retrieve Caesar's eagle.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.307
Me, retrieve Caesar's eagle?

29:39.987 --> 29:42.069
— Brutus?
— Mama!

29:45.660 --> 29:48.868
You can't imagine
how good it is to be home.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.657
You're as brown as a bean.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.372
It makes me look quite soldierly, though.

29:53.501 --> 29:55.867
It does, it does.

29:56.003 --> 29:59.211
— How is cousin Marcellus?
— Tedious but healthy.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.046
— And Caesar?
— Who?

30:01.175 --> 30:05.009
Don't be cruel. Is he well? Did he ask of me?

30:05.846 --> 30:07.928
Did he? I can't recall.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.593
I think not.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.807
He did write you a letter, though.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.052
You beast.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.347
"Dearest Servilia,
forgive my long silence.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.850
"These last long months
were all blood and iron and mud,

30:20.987 --> 30:23.023
"and no time for letters to friends.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.488
"Be sure that l have been
thinking of you with great affection.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.905
"I long to be together and alone with you."

30:34.375 --> 30:36.366
"Great affection."

30:36.502 --> 30:38.458
Longs to be alone with you.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.750
You think he says such things to his wife?

30:41.882 --> 30:44.715
Affection? What's that?

30:48.055 --> 30:50.011
Would you have him pluck a harp?

30:50.141 --> 30:52.348
He's a soldier, not a poet.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.809
The day dwindles. Our guests will be arriving.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.368
You ride well, almost as well as me.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.488
You will address me correctly.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.831
Almost as well as me, sir.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.248
Me, I'm a natural.
My father was an Ubian, probably.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.792
Where did you learn to ride so nice?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.833
Please yourself. Only trying to be pleasant.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.803
My mother's people raised horses in Mutina.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.922
Mutina, near Regium? Up round there?

31:33.059 --> 31:35.926
- Up there.
— Good country.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.437
Listen, sir, thank you for taking me on this job.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.648
— A noble way to make amends.
— Amends?

31:42.777 --> 31:45.359
For getting me into this cack
by calling me names.

31:45.488 --> 31:48.321
- Think nothing of it.
— Never. I won't forget.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.735
Titus Pullo never forgets a favour.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.483
What do you mean, "hah"?

31:52.620 --> 31:55.987
What do you think
our chances are of finding the eagle?

31:56.123 --> 31:58.830
— 13th never fails, eh?
— Little or no chance.

31:58.959 --> 32:03.077
The eagle might be anywhere. Buried,
melted down, sunk to the bottom of the sea.

32:03.214 --> 32:05.250
We are hunting a black dog in the night.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.839
Not finding the eagle is the same as losing it.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.552
We will be disgraced. I chose you
because you are disgraced already

32:11.680 --> 32:14.171
— and condemned to die.
— So not making amends?

32:14.308 --> 32:17.846
Pullo, in effect, you're dead already.

32:17.978 --> 32:21.562
The loss of one drunken fool
does little damage to the legion.

32:21.690 --> 32:25.399
If I'm dead already then, sir, you should
take care how you speak to me.

32:25.528 --> 32:27.894
If I've got nothing to lose,

32:28.030 --> 32:32.399
what's to stop me
cutting you into little gobs and riding off, eh?

32:32.535 --> 32:33.866
What's to stop me, sir?

32:33.994 --> 32:36.861
If your honour as a soldier of the 13th
isn't enough,

32:36.997 --> 32:39.534
I'll have to rely on my superior fighting skills.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.703
Superior fighting skills?

32:42.878 --> 32:43.913
Very good.

32:45.506 --> 32:48.464
And of course, you have
to imagine long hair down to here,

32:48.592 --> 32:51.504
huge moustaches, the most horrific stench.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.923
They eat only raw meat and never wash.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.388
Oh, they do have one admirable custom.

32:56.517 --> 33:00.681
They settle their political disputes
by single combat to the death.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.896
— Excellent idea.
- Isn't it?

33:04.024 --> 33:07.152
Mother is always nagging me to attend politics.

33:07.278 --> 33:12.272
Well, it's been
our family's tradition and duty for 500 years.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.194
It is such dreadfully dull stuff.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.410
If our Senate did business in the German style,
I should certainly go and watch.

33:18.539 --> 33:22.999
No tedious lawsuits and endless debates,
just swords, daggers...

33:23.127 --> 33:26.210
— Much more entertaining.
— Brutus, a word.

33:28.090 --> 33:31.958
Tell me, you are a good judge.

33:32.094 --> 33:36.303
How is my dear friend Caesar?

33:36.432 --> 33:39.890
Well, he is... He's been better, lthink.

33:41.395 --> 33:45.229
Very...very weary, to be honest.
A little demoralised.

33:45.357 --> 33:49.066
— Caesar, demoralised? Never.
- His standard was stolen.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.186
How'd he let a foolish thing like that happen?

33:51.322 --> 33:54.610
I don't know, but his men are in uproar about it.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.233
You know how plebeians
can be about such things.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.655
Desperate to come home, mutinous.

33:59.788 --> 34:05.454
I had heard there was some discontent,
but mutinous? Hard to believe.

34:05.586 --> 34:07.326
Can you imagine?

34:07.463 --> 34:09.704
After all he has done for them,

34:09.840 --> 34:13.253
he is not sure whether they will...
will fight for him any more.

34:13.385 --> 34:18.095
And the lower classes have
a very, very crude sense of loyalty.

34:20.017 --> 34:23.475
No offence. I don't mean you.
You are lower class,

34:23.604 --> 34:26.596
but that is to say,
the lower class in general, however.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.974
A very crude sense of...of loyalty.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.611
Excuse me.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.981
"My dear niece,
I hope you and the children are well.

34:37.117 --> 34:41.531
"l have a task for you. Policy dictates
I give a new wife to Pompey,

34:41.664 --> 34:45.998
"but I have been gone too long to know
who among our family would be suitable.

34:46.126 --> 34:51.462
"I would ask Calpurnia, but though
an excellent wife, she has no eye for this.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.674
"Do me the favour of selecting whichever
girl you think most likely to please

34:55.803 --> 34:58.340
"and offer her to him in my name."

35:01.892 --> 35:03.848
Excuse me, l was far away.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.843
Caesar has no bad news for you, I hope.

35:05.980 --> 35:08.141
No, not at all. Not at all.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.390
— What a lovely party.
- Thank you.

35:10.526 --> 35:13.313
Not as lovely as you look in that dress.

35:15.656 --> 35:19.740
And Octavia. Beautiful.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.859
Well, I try.

35:21.996 --> 35:25.113
She will insist on slouching.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.365
Where's Octavian?

35:27.501 --> 35:29.207
He's in Gaul.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.115
Great Mother says
no harm shall come to your boy.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.331
Good.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.131
Tell me now, how goes your marriage?

36:59.259 --> 37:00.965
Glabius is a good man.

37:01.095 --> 37:04.929
You surprise me. | always thought
there were difficulties between you.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.218
Must you always have a needle in hand?

37:07.351 --> 37:09.637
l was only asking. Excuse my curiosity.

37:09.770 --> 37:13.638
There were some difficulties
in the past, but we overcame them.

37:13.774 --> 37:17.437
— We love each other very much.
— Well, that's a shame. Now | feel bad.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.106
I thought you'd be overjoyed.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.446
What do you mean?

37:23.659 --> 37:26.776
Uncle Julius intends to marry you

37:26.912 --> 37:28.994
to Pompey Magnus.

37:30.457 --> 37:33.290
- Uncle Julius...
— Pompey is a touch low in manner,

37:33.419 --> 37:35.831
but I'm told he's a perfectly adequate lover.

37:35.963 --> 37:38.796
And you shall be the first woman in Rome.

37:40.008 --> 37:44.593
We shall have to get you divorced
from Glabius, obviously. Quick as poss.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.337
I will not do it. I love my husband.

37:47.474 --> 37:52.013
If you do not divorce Glabius willingly,
then Caesar will ask Glabius to divorce you.

37:52.146 --> 37:54.888
— And Glabius will refuse.
— And then he'll be killed.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.934
Does anybody want that to happen?

37:58.819 --> 38:00.309
Caesar would not do that.

38:00.446 --> 38:04.155
The man's been in Gaul for eight years.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.865
He's practically a wild beast.

38:20.007 --> 38:22.043
The man has tears in his eyes.

38:22.176 --> 38:24.167
Tears.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.464
He loves me.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.963
A womanish husband is no use to anyone.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.090
And your servants! What a fuss!

38:31.226 --> 38:33.558
I think you feed them too much.

38:35.272 --> 38:38.514
A little more arsenic, I think, Gaia.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.733
Try to look a little more cheerful, Octavia.

38:41.862 --> 38:44.319
— It's for the good of the family.
— I don't care.

38:44.448 --> 38:47.155
You and l and your brother
are alone in the world.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.900
- We have to be strong.
— We are not alone. Caesar...

38:50.037 --> 38:51.698
Caesar is in Gaul.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.821
Pompey is here.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.541
Courage, my love.

39:04.968 --> 39:08.176
The Parthian were threatening my left flank.

39:08.305 --> 39:13.595
And so, rather than shorten the line
as would be conventional,

39:13.727 --> 39:18.562
I sent in my cavalry reserve
and outflanked the flankers.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.646
Bravo, Magnus. Masterly.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.483
Is he not, Octavia, masterly?

39:29.409 --> 39:30.694
Masterly.

39:30.827 --> 39:35.070
Magnus, tell me something, and be honest.
Does my daughter please you?

39:35.749 --> 39:37.740
Very pleasing, no doubt.

39:37.876 --> 39:42.085
Then I can tell you that Caesar,
as a token of his abiding friendship,

39:42.214 --> 39:45.502
would like to offer her to you in marriage.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.971
She is not married to young Glabius?

39:53.100 --> 39:55.307
Divorced.

39:57.479 --> 40:03.224
- Perhaps you need time to think.
— Excuse me, l was taken unawares.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.820
How could I refuse such
a worthy and dignified bride?

40:07.948 --> 40:10.940
— Caesar is far too generous.
- Excellent.

40:11.076 --> 40:15.160
We would have to wait until next month
for an actual ceremony, of course,

40:15.289 --> 40:17.405
when Julia's mourning days are over.

40:17.541 --> 40:22.410
Of course, of course. But you may take
your betrothal privileges any time you wish.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.255
Now, if you like.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.968
— Really, that's not necessary.
— Don't be silly.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.670
Octavia would love to.

40:33.807 --> 40:38.471
There's no need for shyness.
We're all family now, after all.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.880
British women, now, that's savage cunny.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.000
You have to hunt them down like deer.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.720
Mind, once you get them under you,
slack as your best Narbo scortum.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.713
Do you care for nothing but women?

41:16.850 --> 41:19.182
What else is there? Food, I suppose.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.389
You don't like women?

41:22.522 --> 41:25.685
Of course I do. I'm married to one.

41:25.817 --> 41:29.059
- l have a wife, Niobe.
— | see. Centurions can marry, then?

41:29.196 --> 41:32.563
— I received a special dispensation.
- A special dispensation?

41:32.699 --> 41:34.360
She must be some good...

41:37.329 --> 41:38.865
woman.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.744
She is.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.743
Been a while since you've seen her, then.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.622
Seven years, 140 days.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.625
That's hard. May fortune smile on you.

41:53.345 --> 41:54.960
Me, l have simpler tastes.

41:55.097 --> 41:58.885
I like to kill my enemy,
take their gold and enjoy their women.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.850
That's it. Why tie yourself to one?

42:01.978 --> 42:04.060
Where's the flavour? Where's the joy?

42:04.189 --> 42:08.649
When was the last time you had a woman
who wasn't crying or wanting payment?

42:11.780 --> 42:15.113
You're on first watch.
Wake me when the moon's at the zenith.

42:15.242 --> 42:17.324
Right you are, sir.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.830
Halt!

42:35.887 --> 42:37.297
Sons of Dis!

42:47.357 --> 42:50.315
My people fought at Zama and Magnesia,
my father rode with Sulla,

42:50.444 --> 42:53.936
and I'm reduced to this.
Unhorsed and robbed by children.

43:04.124 --> 43:05.739
Nice horse.

43:28.648 --> 43:31.435
Look here, Mars. Look here, Mars.

43:31.568 --> 43:34.901
I am Titus Pullo.
These bloody men, my gift to you.

43:36.531 --> 43:39.523
Thank the gods you came.
I am extremely grateful to you.

43:43.330 --> 43:46.788
Listen to me. | order you
to release me this instant.

43:46.917 --> 43:50.330
Fine way for a slave to talk.
You won't get far with a mouth like that on you.

43:50.462 --> 43:53.579
I'm no slave. l'm Gaius Octavian of the Julii.

43:53.715 --> 43:56.923
— Great—nephew of Julius Caesar.
— Gaius who?

43:57.052 --> 43:59.043
I am a Roman citizen of noble birth,

43:59.179 --> 44:01.215
and | order you to out these ropes.

44:01.348 --> 44:03.464
Say please.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.220
Please.

44:36.633 --> 44:40.876
Be assured you will be amply rewarded
for your services to me.

44:41.012 --> 44:44.755
- See how good he talks?
— He's convincing, I'll give him that.

44:44.891 --> 44:47.007
Caesar will prove who I am. Take me to him.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.520
We cannot do that as yet. We have orders.

44:49.646 --> 44:52.012
— Orders?
— To find Caesar's stolen eagle.

44:52.148 --> 44:55.436
Caesar wouldn't pull a hair for his eagle.
It's a fool's errand.

44:55.569 --> 44:58.436
lf Caesar doesn't care about it,
why send us to find it?

44:58.572 --> 45:03.407
It would look strange if he made no effort.
Actually, losing the eagle is useful to Caesar.

45:03.535 --> 45:07.824
- Why would that be useful to Caesar?
— Because Pompey is no deep philosopher.

45:07.956 --> 45:10.072
He'll make a symbolic loss a real weakness.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.448
Explain.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.332
Caesar won't strike
the first blow against an old friend,

45:16.464 --> 45:19.331
so he wishes to lure Pompey
into attacking him first.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.049
Pompey will only do this
if he believes Caesar is weak.

45:22.178 --> 45:24.635
No. They're as good as brothers, those two.

45:24.764 --> 45:27.892
When Julia died, the last true bond
between them was cut.

45:28.018 --> 45:32.808
Caesar took the love of the common people
from Pompey, his most prized possession.

45:32.939 --> 45:35.021
A battle is inevitable.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.277
Pullo.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.201
Blue Spaniards!

46:49.891 --> 46:52.007
Good morning, Uncle!

46:54.479 --> 46:56.185
Octavian?

47:02.821 --> 47:06.029
One of Pompey's men. | misjudged him.

47:06.157 --> 47:10.821
I thought it would take strategy to turn him
against me, but he turned as Julia died.

47:10.954 --> 47:14.367
And all the while he was
defending you in the Senate.

47:14.499 --> 47:17.081
He has the cunning of a sardine, poor fool.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.835
The battle begins.

47:21.923 --> 47:23.504
About time.

47:40.650 --> 47:42.732
Porca Juno.

47:44.529 --> 47:48.818
"Dearest Pompey, I believe
the enclosed man belongs to you.

47:48.950 --> 47:52.534
"A quick note to tell you
l have decided to winter the 13th Legion

47:52.662 --> 47:54.618
"closer to home, at Ravenna,

47:54.748 --> 47:58.991
"so I shall soon have the pleasure
of paying you homage in person."

48:29.616 --> 48:33.609
All of you, this is my new wife, Cornelia.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.083
Maybe if you'd summoned a little charm

48:43.213 --> 48:46.046
instead of moping about
like some torpid old she—cow,

48:46.174 --> 48:49.337
— this would never have happened.
— Oh, dear!

48:58.228 --> 49:01.311
Please, I was only speaking in anger.

49:02.398 --> 49:05.390
Everyone knows
it's a political repudiation on account,

49:05.527 --> 49:07.984
Pompey and Caesar are enemies now.

49:09.322 --> 49:13.611
One only has to look at Cornelia.
Poor sad chicken, plucked and boiled.

49:15.662 --> 49:17.948
Maybe Glabius will take me back.

49:19.499 --> 49:22.286
We are well rid of him.

49:22.418 --> 49:25.626
We'll find you somebody
much more worthwhile than Glabius.

49:25.755 --> 49:28.872
I've been dishonoured and shamed
before the whole city!

49:29.008 --> 49:32.751
Nonsense! A girl from a good family
can never be dishonoured

49:32.887 --> 49:35.378
by a villainous little pleb like Pompey!

49:35.515 --> 49:37.597
No...

49:37.725 --> 49:40.853
it is I who has been made to look foolish.

49:40.979 --> 49:45.473
— It is I who have lost face!
— I want him dead.

49:50.864 --> 49:52.980
And that you shall have.

49:57.745 --> 50:00.361
Pompey will eat sand for this.
