01:22.450 --> 01:25.386
So, Edsel,
where does this story begin?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.022
That's the hardest question
I've ever been asked.

01:30.124 --> 01:34.662
I think this really starts
on October 10th, 1901,

01:37.097 --> 01:40.201
when Henry Ford
won a car race

01:40.234 --> 01:42.436
with a vehicle
called "Sweepstakes."

01:44.071 --> 01:45.339
It set the path

01:45.373 --> 01:47.341
for Ford Motor Company.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.477
Ford was born
on a racetrack.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.512
It really is how we began
as a company

01:51.545 --> 01:53.214
and with my great-grandfather,

01:53.247 --> 01:55.616
and so, ever since then,
we've raced.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.787
The GT40 program
was our first venture

01:59.820 --> 02:03.257
into European-style
road racing

02:03.291 --> 02:05.025
against European cars.

02:05.058 --> 02:09.396
We wanted to go racing in
Europe to beat the Europeans.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.299
Especially Ferrari.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.202
In the early '60s,

02:14.235 --> 02:17.771
Enzo Ferrari realized that he
needed some corporate help

02:17.805 --> 02:19.773
if he wanted his company
to continue to grow

02:19.807 --> 02:23.377
and if he wanted to compete at the
uppermost levels of motorsport.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.479
And at the same time,
Ford Motor Company

02:25.513 --> 02:27.948
realized they wanted
to change their image.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.384
They wanted to, sort of,
appeal to the younger buyers

02:30.418 --> 02:32.486
and they thought racing
might be a good way to do that,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.888
so emissaries
from each company

02:34.922 --> 02:39.727
sort of found the other
and they started negotiating.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.129
Ford sent Don Frey who was
high up in the hierarchy,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.898
to negotiate
with Enzo Ferrari.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.536
Things went well for a while,
and then they didn't go so well,

02:48.569 --> 02:51.605
and Ferrari left Ford
at the altar.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.141
Henry Ford II,
who was then running the company,

02:54.174 --> 02:55.343
he was really peeved

02:55.376 --> 02:58.246
that he had essentially gotten
the finger from Enzo Ferrari.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.980
And that's when
he told Don Frey,

03:00.013 --> 03:02.516
"If we can't join him,
we'll go beat him."

03:06.320 --> 03:09.623
Back then,
the pinnacle of road racing

03:09.657 --> 03:11.359
around the world

03:11.392 --> 03:13.961
was going to be Le Mans.

03:13.994 --> 03:17.498
Le Mans is quiet little French
community most of the year,

03:17.531 --> 03:18.699
until the month of June,

03:18.732 --> 03:21.068
when nearly half a million
racing enthusiasts

03:21.101 --> 03:24.405
transform it into the motor
racing capital of the world.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.874
That was about

03:26.907 --> 03:29.109
as ambitious as you can get
as an American company,

03:29.142 --> 03:32.313
to go to Europe and race at
Le Mans to beat Ferrari,

03:32.346 --> 03:34.382
who was dominant
at that time,

03:34.415 --> 03:37.418
actually, had just won
so many years in a row.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.719
Ferrari of Italy

03:38.752 --> 03:41.922
has won the race seven times
out of the last eight.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.493
No American car has ever won.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.462
My father
wanted to beat Ferrari

03:48.496 --> 03:51.332
and it didn't make
any difference what it cost.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.537
He was really serious
about winning the race.

03:56.570 --> 04:01.342
We had all the budget,
the facilities and materials that we needed.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.978
Anything we thought that
we needed was right there.

04:05.012 --> 04:09.417
The first Ford GT was actually
a modified Lola coupe

04:09.450 --> 04:12.420
with a Ford racing body on it.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.888
It was an elegant,
beautiful car.

04:14.922 --> 04:20.192
Problem is,
at speed the air would lift the front wheels.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.195
They got to Le Mans in '64.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.197
Phil Hill set the fastest lap
of the race,

04:24.231 --> 04:26.834
but he said
it's almost undriveable.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.970
I think the first car caught fire
in the third hour or something.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.072
It was a huge bust.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.075
We didn't win that first year,
but we learned a lot.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.811
They came back in '65.
It was a little better.

04:37.845 --> 04:42.350
They showed up at Daytona
and had some success.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.284
And then by '66,
they were ready.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.955
Ford challenged last year
with the GT40 Mk. I.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.425
Now they are here
with the faster Mk. II.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.961
Henry Ford, his wife,
and young son, Edsel,

04:53.994 --> 04:56.330
have arrived to see
the investment pay off.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.206
In the first lap, the track
was wet from a light rain.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.810
Still, the Americans'
aggressive strategy is clear from the start.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.348
Take the lead early, set a fast and
punishing pace, and outlast the competition.

05:14.382 --> 05:18.419
All afternoon, all night,
all morning,

05:18.452 --> 05:21.422
the Ford GTs
were still in the lead.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.491
And here they come
for the finish.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.427
First place,
the number two Ford GT.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.863
Second place,
the number one Ford GT.

05:29.897 --> 05:34.167
Third place,
the number five Ford GT.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.671
An authoritative win
for the American challengers.

05:39.306 --> 05:42.476
The iconic one-two-three finish
at Le Mans was, you know,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.077
perhaps, of all
the great moments,

05:44.111 --> 05:47.615
that was probably the defining
moment in Ford's race history.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.837
My history
at Le Mans, as a kid, started

06:09.870 --> 06:12.740
when I was four months old,
the first time I went.

06:12.773 --> 06:17.478
And then, pretty much
uninterrupted till I was about 18.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.613
I've had five top threes
at Le Mans.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.249
Um, I've raced there 11 times.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.685
This is my 36th time to Le Mans.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.821
Um, so a lot of my life
has been spent there,

06:27.855 --> 06:30.858
and a lot of exposure
to big teams.

06:30.891 --> 06:35.028
There's a genuine excitement
that the Ford GT is in there.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.065
There are fans there
that will have remembered

06:38.666 --> 06:40.601
the cars in 1966.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.538
The sad part about
modern sports car racing

06:44.572 --> 06:46.106
is that no one really goes.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.342
You feel that you're doing it
for TV, not for the crowd.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.412
Go to Le Mans, you feel like
you're doing it for real people.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.682
For drivers that have
never been there before,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.183
it must seem like a zoo.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.520
I'm down here
at the drivers' parade.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.622
This is a tradition
on the Friday of Le Mans.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.157
And we are here to, uh,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.294
go around the town.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.062
The fans have come out
in their droves.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.699
It could be 100,000 people
just over there

07:11.732 --> 07:13.867
and we'll drive round
for half an hour.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.505
We've got 8,000 wristbands
and flags to throw out to them.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.373
It's a chance for them
to see the drivers up close

07:20.407 --> 07:21.809
before the big race tomorrow.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.210
It's a unique experience.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.346
You feel like a bit of rock star
because thousands of fans

07:26.379 --> 07:27.848
are screaming your name,
everything like that.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.149
It's an incredible experience.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.854
This is where
I studied driving

07:33.887 --> 07:37.658
when I was 15 years old,
and I know a lot of people around here.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.034
They saw me grow
from the new kid

07:47.067 --> 07:51.772
in town trying to make it,
you know, to, kind of,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.206
an accomplished
race car driver.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.109
At least a professional who's
making a living from his passion,

07:56.143 --> 07:58.512
which was all I could really
hope for in the beginning.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.654
Le Mans is Le Mans.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.657
It's the Super Bowl
of sports car racing.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.794
To come back
on the 50th anniversary,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.897
of course
we would love to do it again.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.232
I think there's more
competition this year,

08:19.266 --> 08:20.601
if I'm allowed to say that.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.270
There's more manufacturers.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.806
We have Aston,
Ferrari, Porsche...

08:27.541 --> 08:29.309
Corvette, us,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.745
the three other Fords racing.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.881
The competition has never
ever been stronger,

08:34.914 --> 08:36.917
particularly in this category.

08:36.950 --> 08:41.221
Whoever wins this year
is gonna really deserve it.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.857
I am someone who love
the history of this sport.

08:43.890 --> 08:48.261
Ford won this race four times
in a row between '66 and '69.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.397
To be coming back
with the new Ford GT

08:50.430 --> 08:55.603
with four incredible cars
is very exciting for everybody.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.338
I'm very excited to get on with
it and get racing on Saturday

08:58.371 --> 09:00.073
'cause that's what
really matters.

09:00.107 --> 09:04.612
What I became a sports car driver
for was to race here at Le Mans.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.180
And I can't imagine what it
would be like to win this thing.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.922
So, you know what, I...

09:14.955 --> 09:16.624
I'm not here really
to give you a pep talk.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.426
You guys are all professionals.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.596
And you know why we're here.
You know what we're here to do.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.466
But I think there is one thing
that I will remind you of, maybe.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.236
All of you have probably
raced in events

09:29.269 --> 09:30.537
that were more
important to you,

09:30.570 --> 09:33.774
but there is one thing
that I guarantee you.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.944
You will never race again
for as many people

09:36.977 --> 09:39.012
as we're racing for
this weekend.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.750
Ford's raced a lot,
you know that.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.618
We've won
at the Monaco Grand Prix.

09:44.652 --> 09:48.421
We've won Formula One championships.
We've won the Indy 500.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.991
Fifty years ago,
we raced here,

09:51.024 --> 09:54.427
we swept the podium,
and it meant a lot,

09:54.461 --> 09:58.031
because it meant we took
on the world and we won.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.201
So, I'm gonna be
totally unfair,

10:01.234 --> 10:05.839
and remind you that unfortunately
there's only one chance

10:05.873 --> 10:08.041
to celebrate
a 50th anniversary.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.610
The only thing
they're asking of us,

10:10.644 --> 10:14.815
this weekend,
is to go like hell.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.083
So, let's do that.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.457
I can't remember the time that I
actually fell in love with motor racing.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.995
It's strange because there's no one
in my family that is into cars.

10:28.028 --> 10:31.832
Like, you know, it wasn't something
my dad introduced me into.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.867
From as long as
I can remember,

10:33.901 --> 10:36.003
it's something
I've been in love with.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.339
This is really Raj's baby.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.109
He absolutely has been
the driving force behind this

10:42.142 --> 10:44.812
and the one who had the vision
for all of this to happen.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.314
So, all we're doing
is executing on his vision.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.583
We've always been thinking
about building another Ford GT.

10:50.617 --> 10:55.188
The 50th anniversary of the win in
'66 was coming up.

10:55.222 --> 10:59.026
We felt we really have to do
something to honor that win.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.162
Raj and Mark
came to me and said,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.631
"We got something
you're gonna like."

11:04.664 --> 11:05.699
In the car business,

11:05.733 --> 11:09.336
dates count
and anniversaries count.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.707
We have the 50th anniversary
of Le Mans coming up.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.909
Why don't we do another GT?

11:15.943 --> 11:19.679
When you talk Ford GT,
that's a higher calling within the company.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.115
That's an icon that lives on.

11:22.149 --> 11:25.085
Fifty years later,
they're still talking about it.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.854
They're still talking
about it in France.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.824
Well, I mean, one thing's for sure,
when we decided to do the GT,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.192
the birthday party
was gonna happen,

11:32.225 --> 11:36.764
the 50th anniversary, one way or another,
and the time was ticking.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.199
We've got a lot to prove
to not only the world,

11:39.232 --> 11:42.770
but even the people inside our company,
and we intend to do that.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.748
The rules in GT racing are these
are production-based race cars,

11:54.782 --> 11:57.350
and so, you have to have a production
car that you're building from,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.787
but we're still developing
the production cars,

11:59.820 --> 12:03.423
so, we got agreement from
all the other manufacturers

12:03.456 --> 12:05.158
to allow us to race,

12:05.192 --> 12:08.661
as long as we delivered the
production car in a customer's hands

12:08.695 --> 12:09.997
by the end of the year.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.737
Race car development and production car
development almost start at opposite ends.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.306
Race car,
we start from the tire

12:19.339 --> 12:21.408
and we optimize everything.
What does a tire want?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.310
Production car,
we start from the driver

12:23.343 --> 12:27.280
and then we work everything downstream
with the driver to make it feel right.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.582
It's a lot of engineering
to do simultaneously,

12:29.616 --> 12:31.785
having to go through all the legal
things you need to go through

12:31.819 --> 12:34.922
and the durability things you need
to go through for a street car.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.558
And then, be thinking ahead about
what would be ideal on the track.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.398
People were identified within the
company with areas of expertise.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.433
Engines,

12:47.367 --> 12:48.902
suspension technology,

12:49.702 --> 12:51.471
aerodynamics.

12:51.504 --> 12:56.543
It launched this internal
skunkworks within Ford.

12:56.576 --> 13:00.013
It was a completely
confidential project.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.150
It was a decision on the part
of the team to build it,

13:03.183 --> 13:05.819
not so much
as a dedicated supercar,

13:05.853 --> 13:07.888
but almost as a laboratory

13:07.921 --> 13:11.458
for what is possible
for the rest of the Ford line.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.827
To me, that was a very
interesting approach.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.028
But there are difficulties,

13:15.062 --> 13:17.831
'cause if you do that,
can you really be competitive?

13:17.865 --> 13:20.167
Can we really take
an EcoBoost engine

13:20.200 --> 13:24.204
and make it
a competitive race engine?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.106
It's a combination
of direct injection,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.408
turbocharging,
variable cam timing.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.011
So, you can make
a tremendous amount of power

13:31.044 --> 13:33.246
but you can get really great
fuel economy out of them too

13:33.280 --> 13:37.817
which actually is an advantage,
quite an advantage for a race engine.

13:37.851 --> 13:42.322
Who would've thought that we'd be
putting a V6 engine in a supercar?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.892
That's a bold statement,
when we said we're gonna do that.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.561
Carbon fiber, which has had tremendous
application in racing already,

13:48.595 --> 13:51.231
to get the weight out,
to get the strength up.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.867
The Ford GT is almost entirely
carbon fiber.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.568
We're learning a lot
from that,

13:55.602 --> 13:57.104
and we're working with our partners
to make it at lower costs,

13:57.137 --> 14:02.242
so we can then expand the use of carbon
fiber to the rest of the Ford lineup.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.478
We get to use racing
to push the boundaries

14:05.512 --> 14:08.548
for everyday passenger cars
that are in people's driveways.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.664
First M1 is moving.
It's actually mobile,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.533
it's very
restricted calibration.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.002
Raj, I've explained to you,
it's only 3,000 RPM.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.338
Shifts are gonna be delayed.
It's gonna be rough.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.406
- It's treating 3,000 as a redline?
- It is.

14:37.444 --> 14:41.448
You're coming in with an all
new car and an all new team.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.351
We're still learning the car,
we're still developing the car.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.553
Things will happen
that we didn't anticipate.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.091
Whether it's tactics,
whether it's endurance,

14:51.124 --> 14:53.560
whether it's technical issues,

14:53.593 --> 14:56.129
whether it's, do you have
enough outright speed,

14:56.163 --> 14:59.132
you don't know any of that
until you get out on the track.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.277
It's the most fun I've had
doing 20 miles an hour.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.182
Didn't start
eating without us?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.684
All the pizza's gone.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.553
- What do you mean the pizza's gone?
- There's pizza and subs.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.892
We don't have cooling problems
with these engines.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.394
In fact,
we have the opposite.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.298
We have trouble keeping temperature
in them when it's cold outside.

15:31.331 --> 15:35.168
Upon teardown, we did not see
any other signs of distress.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.538
The engine looked, actually,
really good for 20 hours.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.407
We would say with pretty good
confidence that,

15:40.440 --> 15:43.410
that engine would pass
the durability test.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.247
- So we got a race-proven engine in 16?
- Yes, we do.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.616
And Larry's already
started bolting it in.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.619
We're working with Larry Holt,
mastermind from Multimatic.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.489
And Multimatic brings to it expertise
that we don't have at Ford.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.757
They are great racers

15:57.790 --> 16:00.693
and they know how to put race cars
together better than anybody.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.464
When it comes to the road car,
and a ground-up road car,

16:05.032 --> 16:07.600
I think, I think that

16:07.634 --> 16:10.403
there's been a bit of a learning
curve on exactly what it takes,

16:10.437 --> 16:12.105
but again,
we're partners in this.

16:12.139 --> 16:16.509
Starting to look at a lot
of work on the front underwing,

16:16.543 --> 16:19.346
where we found we're hugely
powerful but very sensitive.

16:19.379 --> 16:23.216
We're trying to move the center
pressure on the underwing,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.385
so it's not so pitch sensitive.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.519
We like it a lot,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.522
but it doesn't pinge
on the front of your car, guys.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.959
But we'll work with you
on shape, and,

16:32.992 --> 16:36.763
we just need a gaping hole in the
front of the car, if it's okay, Mort.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.967
Ford Motor Company
can be a little conservative,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.504
and then you have this
mad scientist to really push.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
"What if we did that?
What if we did this?"

16:46.673 --> 16:51.078
And so you have this meld
of crazy ideas and sanity

16:51.111 --> 16:53.646
coming together
in a really great balance.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.716
17th of September,
we have to be there with everybody else

16:56.749 --> 16:58.285
with a representative engine,

16:58.318 --> 17:01.154
basically so that
they can set our BoP.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.461
It seemed like we had
so much time last year.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.999
Ford went to Le Mans
for the first time in 1964.

17:13.031 --> 17:18.003
And it took until their third year,
'66, before they actually won it.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.040
I want to go on record here
that history says

17:21.074 --> 17:23.710
it took three years.
We're going this year,

17:23.742 --> 17:27.714
first year, in the 50th anniversary,
with a very high expectation.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.450
I'm very confident that we
have the tools to do it,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.785
but you'd be
an absolutely arrogant idiot

17:32.819 --> 17:37.324
to sit here and say you're gonna win Le Mans,
because it's, uh,

17:37.357 --> 17:42.595
it's a tough race,
and it can be very nasty.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.165
So when I first heard
about this race program,

17:45.198 --> 17:46.599
my first reaction was,

17:46.633 --> 17:49.469
I mean, I'm 48,
and I was like, "So, so,

17:50.237 --> 17:52.105
I mean,
you want Le Mans winners.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.174
I'm a Le Mans winner,
I have to drive.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.875
I'm still fit, I'm still fast."

17:55.908 --> 17:58.778
And literally,
I went into that mode because...

17:58.811 --> 18:01.080
How could I not? And...

18:01.114 --> 18:02.349
Then everyone
talked me out of it.

18:02.382 --> 18:06.085
But it was such
a dynamic program,

18:06.119 --> 18:08.655
and the thought of it
was so exciting that,

18:09.989 --> 18:11.591
who wouldn't want to be
a part of it?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.260
Fortunately we had
a lot of interest

18:13.293 --> 18:16.829
in race car drivers
in wanting to drive this car.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.666
So, a lot of applications
came in.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.901
Jointly between ourselves
and Chip Ganassi,

18:21.934 --> 18:26.339
we went through that process and
really got the cream of the crop.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.676
How did this whole racing
thing start for you?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.445
That's a great question. I...

18:33.280 --> 18:34.947
When I was...

18:36.649 --> 18:38.418
When I was probably

18:39.319 --> 18:41.221
three years old
or four years old,

18:41.254 --> 18:43.122
my father was in
the asphalt paving business

18:43.156 --> 18:45.492
and he paved a go-kart track.

18:45.525 --> 18:49.162
And they guy didn't pay him
for some reason,

18:49.196 --> 18:52.165
so we ended up
with three go-karts.

18:52.199 --> 18:56.002
When you only weigh about 80 pounds,
five horsepower is a lot.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.638
That's how my motorsports
career got started.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.211
Chip's an interesting guy.
He was a racer himself.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.778
Driver. He raced Indy cars.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.015
He is the second most successful
racing team in the US,

19:09.048 --> 19:10.617
after Roger Penske.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.520
Chip Ganassi hires the crew,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.488
he hires the personnel,
the management.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.426
Everyone to oversee
that the program works.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.229
It's so much about the man
and the machine,

19:22.262 --> 19:25.365
and having to optimize
both of those to be successful.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.000
You could throw a lot of
technology at race cars,

19:28.034 --> 19:31.404
but at the end of the day,
it's all about the gentleman

19:31.438 --> 19:35.342
or the woman who sits behind
the wheel and drives the car.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.709
Edsel wanted to
have a meeting

19:36.743 --> 19:38.878
and he said, "We'd like
to work with your team."

19:38.911 --> 19:41.814
I said, "Sure. You know,
I mean, I'm all ears."

19:46.919 --> 19:50.290
They took us down to the bowels
of a building somewhere.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.025
We walked down a hall
and down another hall.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.861
"Where the hell
are they taking us?"

19:54.894 --> 19:56.896
Sure enough, you know,
we come around the corner,

19:56.929 --> 19:59.632
and there's people beavering
away on a car in the corner,

19:59.666 --> 20:01.334
and you go,
"What the hell is that?"

20:01.934 --> 20:04.271
And that was it.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.139
The way they concealed it
was genius.

20:07.173 --> 20:11.244
I mean, there was no way anyone was
gonna know what was down there.

20:11.278 --> 20:15.715
And the only people that went in there were,
literally, a handful.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.085
There were the designers and
the top people in the company

20:19.118 --> 20:20.587
that were involved
in the project.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.156
No one knew about it.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.593
If you can use innovation

20:26.626 --> 20:30.397
to build the ultimate
Ford performance vehicle,

20:31.364 --> 20:32.632
what would it be?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.767
Well, here's an idea.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.146
When it came out,
the impact was spectacular.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.917
In this day and age,
where you see spy photos of everything,

20:50.950 --> 20:54.354
all the time, it was
an amazing accomplishment

20:54.387 --> 20:56.889
just to get it out
as a surprise.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.526
And then the car itself
was fantastic.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.662
Looking at all the details,

21:02.695 --> 21:06.466
the way the wastegate
exits through the tail light,

21:06.499 --> 21:08.968
and the fact that there was actually
plumbing in the buttresses,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.036
all the stuff.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.373
It is the absolute pinnacle
of what can be done.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.577
I don't think the GT's
successful at all yet.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.011
I don't think we know.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.815
I think it's been well
received by the media.

21:22.849 --> 21:26.453
I think it's been well
received by the enthusiasts,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.588
based on the number
of e-mails I get, um,

21:28.621 --> 21:31.991
on "How do I sign up
to buy one?"

21:32.024 --> 21:35.462
But, you know,
we haven't really launched the car.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.197
The race car's
been in testing,

21:38.230 --> 21:41.568
so we don't really know
whether it's successful yet.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.138
I was thrilled strictly as a fan,
to see Ford,

21:46.172 --> 21:48.074
to hear that Ford intended to,

21:48.107 --> 21:53.346
A, build a new version
of the GT, and, B, go racing.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.314
That said, I gotta confess

21:55.348 --> 21:59.251
that the idea of winning Le Mans your
first time out in a brand new car

21:59.285 --> 22:01.253
is a real big challenge.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.556
I wish them the best,
but I think,

22:03.590 --> 22:07.894
I think I would've been more confident
if this were year two of the program

22:07.927 --> 22:08.961
rather than year one.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.545
You know, the first time
you get in a prototype,

22:25.578 --> 22:27.480
it's a nervous moment.

22:27.514 --> 22:31.584
You can kind of tell,
if you got the basics right.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.654
Is this something you're gonna
be able to work with or is this,

22:34.687 --> 22:36.756
this gonna be a long haul.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.926
This is everything we've been
working towards here, together,

22:39.959 --> 22:41.594
Multimatic and Ford.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.663
There's gonna be
a couple of milestones.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.366
One will be taking the checkered
flag at Le Mans, 2016.

22:47.400 --> 22:52.371
But another important one is the
first day we ever run the racing car.

22:52.405 --> 22:56.042
It's an important day for any
new production car or race car,

22:56.075 --> 22:58.445
that first shakedown.

22:58.478 --> 23:02.449
It's your first chance to figure
out the character of the car.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.116
If it's not good
out of the box,

23:04.150 --> 23:06.018
it's gonna be tough
to make it good

23:06.052 --> 23:08.421
and really tough
to make it great.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.082
Today, it's just exciting to get the
car actually on the track, right?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.684
So expectations were not high.

23:37.717 --> 23:40.620
It was mainly just to see
the car move.

23:40.653 --> 23:44.023
What we're seeing today though, is we're
seeing a car that's almost ready to race.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.933
It's been running good,
but more importantly, it feels right.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.636
It's doing what the simulation
said it would do.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.138
Usually for a shakedown,

23:59.171 --> 24:00.873
we're working out structural
issues that are wrong,

24:00.907 --> 24:02.742
you know, the car
doesn't have the right balance

24:02.775 --> 24:05.612
or we need to go back
and rethink, and,

24:05.645 --> 24:08.681
we're already beyond that step
and talking about

24:08.715 --> 24:11.017
tuning the car,
things that usually happen

24:11.050 --> 24:13.085
weeks or maybe
even months later.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.655
So, it's been
a very good start.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.293
We don't want
to be overconfident.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.930
We're almost, kind of, worried
about how good it's going.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.974
Working through our test
program really quickly

24:35.007 --> 24:37.043
and into development
of the vehicle right away.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.446
Those first initial tests,
we just wanted to make sure we're handing off

24:40.479 --> 24:42.582
a car that's ready
to be race developed,

24:42.615 --> 24:45.117
and providing that
to Chip Ganassi,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.386
and Chip providing,
you know, the crew,

24:47.419 --> 24:51.090
and the race car drivers and
the operational side of that.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.960
I think, for the engineering team,
it's been great.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.263
The development capability
of all of our drivers

24:57.296 --> 25:00.533
in telling us what they need
out of the car.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.168
Four cars,
three drivers per car.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.771
That means you need
to find 12 great drivers.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.775
It's a very
considered decision,

25:08.808 --> 25:11.110
selecting the drivers.

25:11.143 --> 25:15.114
Primarily, you're looking
for speed and consistency.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.651
And then, after that,
you start to get into character

25:18.685 --> 25:20.820
and whether or not
the guy is a team player.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.656
Chip has this amazing knack

25:23.690 --> 25:28.227
to be able to look you in the eye
and know if you're right for us.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.196
There are lots of drivers
out there that are fast.

25:30.229 --> 25:34.166
In endurance racing, where you share the car,
you need to compromise.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.203
There's always a little give
and take with other drivers.

25:37.236 --> 25:41.373
That's ultimately what made
the decision for us.

25:41.407 --> 25:44.410
It's a little bit unheard of,
really, to staff up in such a way,

25:44.443 --> 25:46.378
'cause almost every other
race program

25:46.412 --> 25:50.617
starts with one car and then goes to two,
or whatever, and so,

25:50.650 --> 25:54.687
to staff up for four cars
on two continents

25:54.721 --> 25:57.624
for full schedules,
there's not really a precedent.

25:57.657 --> 26:02.929
You have 12 of the top drivers
in the world who are all,

26:02.962 --> 26:05.898
by virtue of their success,
by what made them successful,

26:05.932 --> 26:10.703
very self-centered,
egotistical, ambitious,

26:10.737 --> 26:14.473
dog-eat-dog, mano-a-mano guys.

26:14.506 --> 26:18.510
Westbrook is one of the most intensely
competitive drivers I've ever met.

26:18.544 --> 26:22.548
He's such a gentleman, but you see him
get pissed off when something happens,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
it makes for a great
interview in the pits

26:24.617 --> 26:26.152
'cause, you know,
there's no holds barred.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.354
Joey Hand, he's a fighter.

26:28.387 --> 26:32.792
He's like an MMA fighter.
You know, he's right there.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.362
It's exciting for Marino.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.497
His brother
had outstanding success.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.934
So first thing is, people go,
"He got to drive because of his brother."

26:41.968 --> 26:44.536
You don't do that in a program
at this level.

26:44.570 --> 26:49.175
But this is his biggest chance
in his career, and he knows it.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.944
But Dirk Muller,
one of Nurburgring's top drivers,

26:53.112 --> 26:55.514
has huge amounts
of GT manufacturer experience.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.384
There's nothing they can throw
him on the radio or on the track

26:58.417 --> 27:00.052
that he won't have seen before.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.588
I love the fact they brought
this group together.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.556
Ford's history at Le Mans

27:04.590 --> 27:07.794
is one of the greatest stories
in motorsports of all time.

27:07.827 --> 27:12.364
And to be at the return
is beyond words.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.101
It's not too often programs
come around like this.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.036
I haven't even been
to Le Mans, so,

27:17.069 --> 27:18.404
it's for me,

27:18.437 --> 27:21.340
there's gonna be
a lot of eyes wide open,

27:21.373 --> 27:23.275
mouth probably a little bit,
too, occasionally,

27:23.309 --> 27:26.378
just, you know,
taking it all in.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.814
You know,
the history of Le Mans,

27:27.847 --> 27:30.783
the first thing you think
about is the Ford GTs.

27:30.817 --> 27:34.020
Suddenly, you're being a part of that.
It's like a dream come true.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.422
For me, that's the first thing
that came to mind.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.924
I want to be
part of that history.

27:37.957 --> 27:42.328
There's nobody there that wouldn't
send that thing right into the fence,

27:42.929 --> 27:44.130
trying to win that race.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.199
'Cause those are all
top-notch, front-running

27:49.068 --> 27:51.537
badasses in those cars
right now.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.072
You could almost overdo it.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.309
To be handed the mantle
to make this program

27:57.343 --> 27:59.712
be successful and win,
that's a big deal,

27:59.746 --> 28:02.882
so Ganassi's assembled the kind
of driving talent that, you know,

28:02.915 --> 28:06.618
there are no excuses.
They've been assembled for a reason.

28:06.652 --> 28:09.088
They're professionals
and they're there to win.

28:12.158 --> 28:15.795
Prior to Le Mans, we'll have six races,
starting at Daytona.

28:15.828 --> 28:18.831
All of those are gonna be
real races,

28:18.865 --> 28:20.066
but they're also,
to some extent,

28:20.099 --> 28:21.467
gonna be practice for Le Mans.

28:21.500 --> 28:26.305
And certainly, our plan is get better
every single race in leading up

28:26.338 --> 28:29.976
to make sure we're ready
as we can be for Le Mans.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.411
I mean, look,
we have an all-new car

28:32.444 --> 28:36.582
we're having all-new drivers,
who have no familiarity with those vehicles.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.684
So, it's a very tall order.
It's a very tall order.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.187
Having said that,
I expect us to win.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.125
Welcome, everyone,
to Daytona. I'm Brian Till,

28:46.158 --> 28:49.061
thrilled to be a part
of another Rolex 24.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.030
And that Ford GT
has everyone talking.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.332
The guy that's been dreaming
about this for months

28:53.365 --> 28:57.103
is Executive VP and Chief Technical
Officer of Ford, Raj Nair.

28:57.136 --> 29:00.239
Now, the battle back then
was with Ferrari.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.008
The crosstown guys
are Corvette.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.176
We all dream about
storybook finishes,

29:04.210 --> 29:07.246
who would you like to be banging
doors with and head out by a nose,

29:07.279 --> 29:09.548
Corvette or Ferrari,
in 24 hours?

29:09.581 --> 29:13.886
We're pretty focused on the win,
so hopefully we don't focus too much time

29:13.920 --> 29:15.687
on what the order
behind us is, so,

29:15.721 --> 29:17.289
we're just gonna focus
on the front.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.259
Nervous.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.429
Really, yeah. Nervous, stressed.
Stressed out a bit.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.966
You know, everything that we need
to do technically, we've done.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.101
I'm very confident
in that aspect.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.669
But 24-hour
endurance racing,

29:30.702 --> 29:35.041
there's a bit of statistical
luck associated with it.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.643
I'm not gonna tell you
we're not here to win.

29:37.676 --> 29:40.346
You go racing to win,
we all go racing to win,

29:40.379 --> 29:44.016
but this really is all about
going to Le Mans.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.119
This is it for my career.
I don't know what I'm gonna do after this.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.688
Buy a winery somewhere,
I don't know.

29:49.721 --> 29:53.359
This is it. This is it.
Going to Le Mans this year, that's it.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.296
They roll into the throttle.

29:57.329 --> 30:01.633
We are green in Daytona,
the Rolex 24!

30:01.667 --> 30:04.470
And speaking of machines,
there's the 66, Joey Hand.

30:04.503 --> 30:08.640
He is now up into second,
and is running down the 911 of Tandy.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.343
This is first.
In second, a GTR Lam.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.480
He's going to the outside.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.883
He pulled the draft early
and popped out,

30:16.916 --> 30:19.919
runs alongside,
he's gonna cross the stripe in the lead.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.687
Can he hold it down
into turn one?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.856
Ford leads on their debut.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.594
Ford versus Chevrolet
here on the high banks.

30:28.627 --> 30:31.463
This is gonna be an interesting one here.
Take a look at that Ford.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.565
Delayed him. That was close.
Something's a problem.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.301
There's a problem. Yeah.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.237
Certainly lost the drive there,
off of that turn for Ryan Briscoe.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.217
Carried out
a bit of diagnostics,

31:25.251 --> 31:27.519
found that it was one
of the pneumatic belts

31:27.553 --> 31:30.389
that controls the shifting
in the gearbox.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.225
Not something we've
seen today in testing.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.161
It's a shame
it had to happen in the race.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.265
Another problem
for one of the Ford GTs.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.334
It is the 66.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.504
This is not good. So,
Joey is gonna pull it off the racing surface,

31:45.537 --> 31:49.241
down to the inside.
He's lost drive completely.

31:49.275 --> 31:54.280
He's gonna have to rely on safety workers
to get him back into the garage area.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.621
I hate losing.
I don't like it.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.357
To be honest,
we expected the reliability to be better.

32:05.391 --> 32:09.195
Some of the things that broke today
are either not even new for the car,

32:09.228 --> 32:12.164
or they're parts that are lot of the
rest of the field are running as well,

32:12.198 --> 32:14.066
but for some reason
that broke on our car.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.036
Some of the things we wouldn't
see in normal testing.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.770
You just have to race
to see it.

32:18.804 --> 32:23.209
That doesn't change the frustration
of having that many issues.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.251
This car,
since it's been back out and running, Cal,

32:32.284 --> 32:34.120
has been running very,
very quickly.

32:34.153 --> 32:38.224
It really has. I think Ryan Briscoe may
have set the fastest lap of the race

32:38.257 --> 32:40.426
in GTLM category,
so he has shown pace.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.629
And this 24-hour race will now
become a test session for them,

32:43.662 --> 32:46.532
if they're looking at the big
picture of the championship.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.734
I know they wanted success
their first time out,

32:48.767 --> 32:51.137
but there's a lot
of other milestones

32:51.170 --> 32:54.106
they're going to try and reach
this year as well.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.442
We've got a good amount
of time to go back

32:56.475 --> 32:59.511
and take a look at what went
right and what went wrong.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.682
I think we'll come back,
ready to go for Sebring.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.651
We'll be even stronger
than we are right now.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.323
You can't have it both ways.
You can't have something

33:11.357 --> 33:15.194
really, really, really matter and
have it be totally controlled.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.895
That's just the nature of it.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.364
But that's what
makes this sport.

33:18.397 --> 33:23.001
I mean, the highs are so high,
but they're also not frequent, you know,

33:23.035 --> 33:26.572
and so, you know,
the best guys win

33:27.806 --> 33:29.508
ten percent of the races,
you know.

33:29.541 --> 33:33.112
And so, to have
everything line up

33:33.145 --> 33:37.349
on the day, on the year,
just doesn't happen very often.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.718
We showed up at Daytona
with higher hopes

33:39.751 --> 33:43.955
and obviously left with our tail
between our legs a little bit.

33:43.989 --> 33:47.126
I think we were caught out
by some,

33:47.159 --> 33:50.762
by some issues that I
would characterize as...

33:50.796 --> 33:52.864
When you're trying to
do things in six months

33:52.898 --> 33:55.000
that other people have been
working on for six years,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.136
you say, "Oh, yeah,
I forgot about that."

33:57.169 --> 34:02.040
The general conversation
after Daytona was,

34:02.074 --> 34:03.842
you know, was,
"Are they embarrassed?"

34:03.875 --> 34:07.479
They tell you the program is good.
They tell you the car is strong.

34:07.513 --> 34:10.482
They tell you that they're
gonna win a race at some point.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.818
And then to not be
able to make it

34:12.851 --> 34:16.255
to the first two hours of the
race because of a gearbox issue,

34:16.288 --> 34:18.424
you're immediately like,
"Are they embarrassed?

34:18.456 --> 34:20.726
Were they lying?
Have they had these issues?"

34:20.759 --> 34:23.995
And so it raises some
question marks for sure.

34:24.029 --> 34:27.998
Welcome to the pit lane at the
one and only Sebring 12 hours.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.935
This is spring break
for racers,

34:29.967 --> 34:33.272
and over 80,000 people have been
here partying this weekend.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.674
But right now it's time
for those racers to rock.

34:35.706 --> 34:38.244
With more on the action at the
front of the grid is Jamie Howe.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.647
The energy here at Sebring, Justin,
has been felt all week long.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.583
The nerves and the angst from not
just the drivers, but also the crews,

34:45.617 --> 34:46.618
has been evident.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.558
Coming up to Daytona
we had some issues.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.393
We know we have them fixed.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.629
But this Sebring.
This is a whole new animal.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.666
So I don't expect to see
the issues that we fixed.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.770
But it won't surprise me
if we see some new issues.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.273
Looks like we're going to get some
rain today, and that's a good thing.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.075
To go out and put the car
through its paces in the rain.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.443
So, today's
gonna be interesting.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.678
This is the kind of track,

35:12.711 --> 35:16.215
we always say it's half the
size and twice as hard,

35:16.248 --> 35:17.549
so we'll see what happens.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.556
Now,
onboard the 66, from Ford.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.692
Running third right now,
Dirk Muller.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.895
A lot of people were surprised to
see some of the problems they had

35:29.928 --> 35:31.963
at the Rolex 24.
I don't think we were.

35:31.997 --> 35:35.434
Brand-new car, first race,
and what they really want,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.636
the prize that they want
is Le Mans, coming up in June.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.622
When the airplane crashes,
who do you blame?

35:57.856 --> 35:59.358
The pilot.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.027
That's the position you
choose to put yourself in,

36:02.060 --> 36:04.596
when you want to become a
professional race car driver.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.766
But sometimes it's not
necessarily always fair.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.969
You don't want to be that guy
that writes that thing off.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.672
You just don't want
to be that guy.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.883
It's only left.

36:24.916 --> 36:29.488
I tried, I tried, I tried, but there was so
much water, I was basically just boating,

36:29.521 --> 36:31.957
and, yeah, it was unfortunate.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.926
But the team came to me and said,
"There was nothing you can do,"

36:34.960 --> 36:39.798
which brings me up again because
you feel you let your boys down.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.543
Dirk just got caught out
in a lockup into turn one.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.944
There was nothing
he could do,

36:52.978 --> 36:54.313
the car hydroplaned,

36:54.346 --> 36:57.015
all the telemetry set,
the brake pressure, everything was good,

36:57.048 --> 37:00.719
but the car just hydroplaned
and went into the tire wall.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.789
Unfortunately, right after that is when
they red flagged it for the conditions,

37:03.822 --> 37:06.892
so we just missed that
by a little bit,

37:06.925 --> 37:10.296
and now the car's back here
in the garage,

37:10.329 --> 37:14.466
but during a red flag,
you can't repair the vehicle.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.835
Looks like it's gonna be
a red flag for a while.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.544
I spend most of my time
on the NASCAR side of things,

37:25.577 --> 37:28.079
and then I fly in on race day,
or race weekend,

37:28.113 --> 37:31.483
and help these guys.
I help on the front end of these cars.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.252
We wanna perform well.
We wanna, you know,

37:34.286 --> 37:36.822
make some history,
and back up the program,

37:36.855 --> 37:38.590
for Ford and for ourselves
as fans,

37:38.624 --> 37:42.761
I think all of us are trying to think
more long term towards Le Mans.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.564
Trying to make big gains
on our reliability

37:45.597 --> 37:47.533
and try to make the best of it.

37:54.973 --> 37:58.944
I'm happy. I'm not like "thrilled,
jumping up and down" happy.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.412
All the issues
we had at Daytona,

38:00.446 --> 38:02.681
we didn't have any
re-occurrence of those issues,

38:02.714 --> 38:07.052
so, from that perspective,
I think we're good.

38:07.085 --> 38:10.722
Through these first few races,
maybe we got our bad luck out of the way.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.624
Here we see that 66 car

38:12.658 --> 38:14.326
that's been through the wars
a little bit here today.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.596
Problems, it looked like,
from both of these Ford GTs.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.369
I think we've been building
momentum since Daytona.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.340
We've been working on getting
everything synced together,

38:28.374 --> 38:31.577
getting the whole team,
getting the car ready to be durable and run.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.445
We want to show up
at the track,

38:33.479 --> 38:36.314
not have a lot of
the extra-curricular activity

38:36.348 --> 38:37.649
and just go race.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.424
With every race,
we continue to improve

38:45.457 --> 38:47.793
and get better, and get faster,
and get more reliable.

38:47.826 --> 38:52.163
And coming into Laguna,
everybody felt positive

38:52.197 --> 38:56.868
and cautiously optimistic
about the weekend.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.804
Now see,
the second of the Ford GTs,

38:58.837 --> 39:00.439
Richard Westbrook
down to the inside,

39:00.472 --> 39:02.273
into the hairpin,
what a move!

39:02.307 --> 39:06.812
What a story this is, as they head
into the month of June, into Le Mans.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.647
And he heads up
into final turn.

39:08.680 --> 39:13.051
And here it is! The first win!
The Ford GT at Monterey!

39:13.084 --> 39:15.353
Today, it came together.

39:15.387 --> 39:20.759
From Daytona to Laguna Seca,
you saw a program gel.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.395
You saw them
have problems mechanically.

39:23.429 --> 39:26.965
You saw them
have problems personally.

39:26.998 --> 39:30.469
And then you saw them all come
together and make it work.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.538
Not only was it the first,
obviously, win for the GT,

39:32.571 --> 39:35.741
but it was the biggest morale
boost that you could have had

39:35.774 --> 39:37.443
in a team that has been working

39:37.476 --> 39:40.178
24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

39:40.211 --> 39:41.947
giving everything they got.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.083
And what a validation
of what's been going on.

39:45.116 --> 39:48.687
Two Fords getting ready
for the big one.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.790
This is more like the cars we
were expecting to see from Ford

39:51.823 --> 39:53.925
at the beginning
of the season.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.628
These are the Fords
we've been looking for.

39:58.363 --> 39:59.364
Everyone's ready,

39:59.397 --> 40:02.468
but then,
the actual race happens,

40:02.501 --> 40:05.504
and things
you just can't predict.

40:05.537 --> 40:08.306
It's racing,
and everyone knows in racing,

40:08.339 --> 40:09.641
things go wrong.

40:27.292 --> 40:30.896
The best racer in the world
loses more races than he wins.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.533
You have to have
a mentality of,

40:34.566 --> 40:37.268
if you lose,
you don't dwell on losing,

40:37.302 --> 40:40.839
you dwell on why did you lose and how are
you gonna fix that for the next race.

40:52.317 --> 40:56.822
Sitting here, three days before the start
of the race, I guess the biggest thing is,

40:56.855 --> 41:00.091
where do we really stand
with the pace of the car

41:00.125 --> 41:03.829
and the endurance of the car? You know,
I think that's everybody's question.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.497
There's a lot of stuff
going on.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.435
I don't really like the week,
I like the race.

41:10.468 --> 41:14.205
You're just building up,
and you want to get out on the track.

41:14.239 --> 41:15.541
But Wednesday's a good day.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.576
It's the start
of first practice,

41:17.609 --> 41:19.044
start of first qualifying.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.187
You want to have the fastest lap at
the end of the qualifying session,

41:29.220 --> 41:32.991
so that you can start on pole
for the 24 hours of Le Mans.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.160
Ford kinda came in
and surprised everybody.

41:35.193 --> 41:40.832
They weren't spectacular in the test
days in the week leading up to the race,

41:40.866 --> 41:43.301
but they were spectacular
in qualifying.

41:43.334 --> 41:47.505
Ford had their four cars
in the top five positions.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.943
Being one, two, four
and five is a good start.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.212
It was the first time
we had run

41:54.245 --> 41:58.617
the car in full out
qualifying trim here, and,

41:58.650 --> 42:00.919
I think it's fair to say,
for all of us, the car

42:00.952 --> 42:02.954
responded even better
than we expected,

42:02.988 --> 42:05.323
which is why
there's a good mood here.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.660
We got a lot of work to do,
so it'll be important to stay focused.

42:13.398 --> 42:15.767
People are excited
about where we qualified,

42:15.801 --> 42:17.769
and that's a good thing,
and it's exciting,

42:17.803 --> 42:21.106
and it shows
the potential of the car.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.541
In reality,

42:23.575 --> 42:27.512
in an endurance race,
qualifying is not very important.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.782
By Sunday afternoon,
people will forget where everyone qualified.

42:35.721 --> 42:38.489
They have a lofty expectation.

42:38.523 --> 42:42.761
The perfect story is that they win
this particular weekend in June.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.663
No one will blame them
for not winning.

42:44.696 --> 42:48.533
Because it's too hard a feat to
go to Le Mans in the first year.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.335
They'll lead the race, for sure.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.772
They'll lead the race
for a lot of it, I think.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.341
Their drivers are equally
as fast as anybody,

42:56.374 --> 42:58.443
and the car is super quick.

42:58.476 --> 43:01.579
But the demands
of the long run through

43:01.613 --> 43:03.548
and not getting involved
in accidents,

43:03.581 --> 43:06.785
and what is the weather
gonna be like, is tough.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.590
When I came on
in the first year of Corvette,

43:12.624 --> 43:14.259
our three-year program

43:14.292 --> 43:18.897
was, literally,
just to be able to go there.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.899
That first year,
our car finished third,

43:20.932 --> 43:24.936
and Ron's car finished fourth,
and the team was ecstatic.

43:24.970 --> 43:29.540
Never did anyone have
a delusional thought

43:29.574 --> 43:31.142
that we're going there
to win the race.

43:31.176 --> 43:35.313
It's much harder
than anybody thinks, and,

43:35.346 --> 43:38.183
you know, sometimes
you can have all the...

43:38.216 --> 43:41.019
all the components that you
think are right in line,

43:41.052 --> 43:43.922
but they've got to gel,
they've got to blend,

43:43.955 --> 43:47.358
and, you know, best of luck
to them. For sure.

43:50.929 --> 43:54.632
But it is no easy feat to go in
there the first time after 50 years

43:54.666 --> 43:56.034
and try to win that race.

43:57.368 --> 44:00.638
Ford's data-bank of going
to Le Mans is not rich.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.973
Same for Ganassi.

44:02.007 --> 44:06.144
Ganassi have no institutional
knowledge of going to Le Mans.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.578
I mean,
everyone else is trying to win.

44:07.612 --> 44:11.516
Corvette are probably the
highest technology race team

44:11.549 --> 44:13.218
outside McLaren.

44:13.251 --> 44:17.188
Pratt & Miller do the guidance systems
for tracking missiles in space.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.390
So they can make a race car
go around the track.

44:19.424 --> 44:22.761
They've won there eight or ten
times out of the last 15 years.

44:22.794 --> 44:25.797
Porsche, man,
they've got that place figured out.

44:25.831 --> 44:29.801
They are the outright
all-time winning brand.

44:29.835 --> 44:33.972
And it is to this day
what creates that aura

44:34.005 --> 44:36.007
that makes Porsche what it is.

44:36.908 --> 44:39.410
Ford? It's an unknown entity.

44:39.444 --> 44:42.180
There's gonna be things
that need to be figured out.

45:19.050 --> 45:23.989
The tough thing here at Le Mans is
the track's about 8.5 miles long,

45:24.022 --> 45:26.958
so you could have rain on one
end and dry on the other.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.861
That's when it becomes very tricky
because you have to stay on slick tires.

45:29.895 --> 45:32.497
You can't use rains 'cause you'll
burn up the rains on the dry part.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.800
So, you have to just work your
way through the wet part.

45:39.137 --> 45:43.842
From a driver's standpoint, we just really
would like to have one or the other.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.477
It becomes really tricky
when it goes back and forth.

45:47.145 --> 45:49.347
But it is what it is.

45:49.380 --> 45:52.383
Le Mans is
a very treacherous place.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.786
There was times
where there's river crossings,

45:54.820 --> 45:57.923
and you'd go over it three times
and you wouldn't aquaplane,

45:57.956 --> 46:01.793
and you'd hit it at the same angle
the next time at 180 miles an hour

46:01.827 --> 46:05.330
and the whole car would go...

46:05.363 --> 46:08.299
Like that, and then you'd go,
"Oh, you gotta breathe."

47:39.490 --> 47:41.392
The number 67 Ford GT,

47:41.426 --> 47:44.195
one of four identical cars
in this race,

47:44.229 --> 47:47.298
being backed into its garage.
Andrew Marriott, can you update?

47:47.332 --> 47:49.634
Yeah, they've definitely got
an engine problem with this.

47:49.667 --> 47:52.103
They fired it up a couple of times,
the rear deck is off.

47:52.137 --> 47:54.505
So,
that's what they're working on at the moment.

47:54.539 --> 47:57.875
I'm pretty sure that this car
won't take the start.

47:57.909 --> 47:59.210
Driver sitting at the wheels,

47:59.244 --> 48:02.747
there's about 15 people
all clustered around him.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.983
George Howard-Chappell,
the team manager,

48:05.016 --> 48:07.752
is directing operations here.

48:07.785 --> 48:10.421
There is definitely something
wrong with the motor.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.652
Well, Harry,
this is a crushing disappointment.

48:41.686 --> 48:44.155
I thought it was a motor problem,
but it seems to be the gearbox.

48:44.189 --> 48:46.524
Yeah, gearbox issue.
We lost gearbox pressure

48:46.557 --> 48:49.961
on the reconnaissance lap,
so, I put into the box, and,

48:49.995 --> 48:51.896
the boys think they've found
maybe a quick fix,

48:51.929 --> 48:53.064
so we're gonna see
if that works.

48:53.098 --> 48:55.033
If not, I think we're gonna
be in for slightly longer.

48:55.066 --> 48:58.136
But we're gonna try this now
and see how it goes.

48:58.169 --> 49:02.040
You had one of the Fords
starting from the garage.

49:02.073 --> 49:05.310
The cars are so close.
They're built exactly the same,

49:05.343 --> 49:07.512
so, immediately,
off the bat, you're like,

49:07.545 --> 49:10.248
"Okay. So, are four cars gonna
make the end of this race,

49:10.281 --> 49:13.084
or are any cars gonna make the
end of the race?" It was...

49:13.118 --> 49:17.688
For 24 hours, you're questioning
the survival of the program.

49:17.722 --> 49:20.358
Yeah, for that to happen
even before the race starts,

49:21.926 --> 49:23.161
on the one hand,
you're thinking,

49:23.194 --> 49:25.963
"Oh, boy. This is gonna be
a long 24 hours."

49:25.997 --> 49:29.667
On the other hand, I was thinking,
"Well, I'm glad I brought four cars."

49:31.436 --> 49:33.371
Back live, at Le Mans,

49:33.404 --> 49:36.741
on a rainy French day,
but the sun is poking through.

49:36.774 --> 49:39.077
Crowd in the grandstand
are folding their umbrellas,

49:39.110 --> 49:41.512
and taking off their rain slickers,
that's a good sign.

49:41.546 --> 49:45.783
This is the first time
in the 84 runnings of this race

49:45.816 --> 49:49.720
that the 24 hours of Le Mans has
started behind the safety car.

50:03.168 --> 50:07.238
Sixty cars are now on their
way at Le Mans under green.

50:08.806 --> 50:11.709
The fast structure in sports
car racing is unique.

50:11.742 --> 50:15.012
You have, essentially,
four different races going on

50:15.046 --> 50:16.881
on the racetrack
at the same time.

50:16.914 --> 50:19.384
So, you have the prototypes.

50:19.417 --> 50:21.819
Those are things that
manufacturers are developing

50:21.852 --> 50:25.890
to be on their cars,
maybe five-ten years down the road.

50:25.923 --> 50:27.958
From a coverage standpoint,

50:27.992 --> 50:29.960
you always follow
the overall leader.

50:29.994 --> 50:33.531
So, that's always, in sports car racing,
going to be a prototype.

50:33.564 --> 50:39.304
But recently, the GT categories
have gained a lot more interest

50:39.337 --> 50:42.340
because they are cars
that people can relate to.

50:42.373 --> 50:47.612
GTE pro cars look like cars that you
would see driving down the street.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.615
The competition level there
is so intense.

50:50.648 --> 50:52.317
What a battle here in GTE pro,

50:52.350 --> 50:56.987
between the Ferraris and the Fords,
just like we saw 50 years ago.

50:57.021 --> 50:58.423
What a battle it is,

50:58.456 --> 51:02.227
as one of the Ferraris jumps
in front of the Ford GTs.

51:10.034 --> 51:12.770
Everywhere you go,
someone reminds you about the history

51:12.803 --> 51:15.340
of Ford in Le Mans.

51:15.373 --> 51:17.642
So, you're permanently
reminded of it,

51:17.675 --> 51:20.811
and you can't really escape it.
Not that I want to.

51:26.151 --> 51:28.653
For me,
I think there's definitely some nerves.

51:28.686 --> 51:32.022
You understand
the big picture.

51:32.056 --> 51:36.161
You understand the emphasis
on the 50-year,

51:36.194 --> 51:39.264
you know,
there's a big story behind it.

51:39.297 --> 51:45.303
But to expect to come here and win the
first year is a very large expectation.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.673
We try to think
of everything as a team.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.908
You try to think
of every different scenario.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.779
But a lot of us haven't been here,
we haven't raced here before.

51:54.812 --> 51:57.248
There are so many things
that can take you out of it.

51:57.282 --> 51:59.784
But I think,
with having four cars,

51:59.817 --> 52:01.419
you know, definitely,

52:01.452 --> 52:05.223
you know, spreads that stress,
and emotion a little bit.

52:06.991 --> 52:09.560
No matter what happens,
we're gonna be part of history.

52:09.594 --> 52:12.062
I'm gonna be one of those guys
that, 50 years later,

52:12.096 --> 52:13.398
made an attempt at this.

52:13.431 --> 52:16.534
Hopefully, we can say that we won it,
or podiumed or whatever,

52:16.567 --> 52:18.436
but at least
made an attempt at it.

52:49.367 --> 52:50.901
This is not
where you want to be

52:50.935 --> 52:53.471
at the end of the Mulsanne
into Mulsanne Corner.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.473
And for Marino Franchitti,

52:55.506 --> 52:57.408
that's not where
he wants to be right now.

52:57.442 --> 53:00.711
He said on the radio, "I just locked 'em up,
I couldn't get it unlocked."

53:00.745 --> 53:02.913
He is not the first car
that we have seen in there.

53:02.947 --> 53:06.451
In fact,
it's a very popular place to be today,

53:06.484 --> 53:09.687
but it's an easy mistake to make
at the end of the straightaway.

53:09.720 --> 53:14.725
The good news for Ford is this is the
car that had the problem early on.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.927
It was already
several laps down

53:16.961 --> 53:20.965
and they did bring
four of them, so...

53:20.998 --> 53:24.269
Right now, the 67 car
is really out of contention.

53:24.302 --> 53:26.070
The 68 car
is doing really well.

53:26.103 --> 53:29.507
It's trading first place back and
forth with Ferrari right now, so,

53:29.540 --> 53:31.409
we'll see
what the night brings.

53:59.437 --> 54:02.407
Good time to make some driver changes,
go ahead.

54:02.440 --> 54:05.810
Put those guys in and let
them run into the twilight,

54:05.843 --> 54:07.978
and then when you put
your next driver in

54:08.012 --> 54:10.515
in a couple of stints from now,
few stints from now,

54:10.548 --> 54:12.350
they can get in
in total darkness,

54:12.383 --> 54:14.151
and they'll already be
acclimated to it.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.822
We saw the 68, Joey Hand,
pitted from the lead,

54:17.855 --> 54:20.858
Sebastien Bourdais
has taken over that car.

54:20.891 --> 54:24.261
Billy Johnson
aboard the 66 now.

54:24.295 --> 54:27.298
And you brought up the point too,
Bryan, about having the same driver

54:27.332 --> 54:32.503
in this transitional period
from daylight to darkness.

54:32.537 --> 54:35.105
The effect that the sun
has on your eyes.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.907
The different places that you,

54:36.941 --> 54:39.243
that it bothers you around the race track,
and having someone in there

54:39.276 --> 54:42.447
as it's transitioning and not
just in there right away.

54:44.349 --> 54:46.183
Beginning of the race
was a little bit stressful

54:46.216 --> 54:49.854
'cause number 67
had some gearbox problems.

54:49.887 --> 54:51.889
But got back in,
and they're all racing now.

54:51.922 --> 54:54.725
And I can't wait
till the sun goes down

54:54.759 --> 54:57.962
because that's when it becomes
really, really special.

55:13.143 --> 55:16.013
Beautiful overhead view,
as the night falls

55:16.046 --> 55:18.549
and the party begins
in earnest.

55:44.108 --> 55:46.343
Racing at Le Mans,
especially at night,

55:46.377 --> 55:49.046
is very
"out of body" experience.

55:49.079 --> 55:51.716
Not that it's so pleasant,
but you're doing it

55:51.749 --> 55:55.586
and the visual input
you're getting as a human

55:55.620 --> 55:57.755
is very out of this world.

56:03.461 --> 56:05.563
The guys do get into a,

56:05.596 --> 56:09.133
let's not call it, no,
a trance state, that sounds crazy,

56:09.166 --> 56:11.268
but guys get in a zone.

56:11.301 --> 56:13.538
And, at night, especially.

56:13.571 --> 56:18.142
And you get in a rhythm
of driving that track,

56:18.175 --> 56:22.212
and where, on occasion,
you talk to your driver on the radio,

56:22.246 --> 56:25.382
and they'll not answer you.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.586
It's like you're
almost in a dream

56:30.187 --> 56:31.822
because everything
is so weird.

56:32.690 --> 56:35.125
The lights, the weather,

56:35.159 --> 56:36.861
the racing itself.

56:38.563 --> 56:42.633
You know, you have to really trust
your knowledge of the course,

56:42.667 --> 56:47.304
because you're going into corners
at 170-180 miles an hour,

56:47.337 --> 56:52.209
and if you get it wrong,
you're gonna get really hurt.

56:52.242 --> 56:55.580
I mean, it is dangerous.
It is dangerous.

56:55.613 --> 56:57.482
You can't get away from that.

56:57.515 --> 57:02.520
It's, it's that sort of tunnel feeling
when you go through Tertre Rouge,

57:02.553 --> 57:04.288
down the long straight
and then,

57:04.321 --> 57:07.758
sometimes it can get a bit lonely out there,
it's weird, it's...

57:07.792 --> 57:10.961
you know, sometimes in the night
you don't see any other cars

57:10.995 --> 57:14.865
and you might do a radio check,
just to check, you know,

57:14.899 --> 57:16.767
your team is still there.

57:18.469 --> 57:22.139
We put repeaters out all round the track,
radio repeaters.

57:22.172 --> 57:25.576
Our telemetry can't deal
with the size of that track,

57:25.610 --> 57:30.581
so if you're just trying to take
everything in and out from the pits,

57:30.615 --> 57:33.350
the Mulsanne Corner's
too far away.

57:33.383 --> 57:36.153
So you got these repeaters out
there and you do everything you can

57:36.186 --> 57:38.656
to keep a radio contact
with the driver.

57:45.362 --> 57:48.799
Back at Le Mans, lighter still
in the skies overhead.

57:48.833 --> 57:53.203
Partly cloudy skies, it looks like,
hopefully, we are free of rain

57:53.237 --> 57:55.472
in the run to the finish.

57:55.506 --> 57:57.642
Now a little over
nine hours away.

57:57.675 --> 58:00.911
Overnight,
Ford and Ferrari went back and forth.

58:00.945 --> 58:03.347
And then, when the sun came up
for the second day,

58:03.380 --> 58:06.551
Ferrari was leading and Ford
found themselves in second.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.900
Ferrari really came
to life here,

58:22.933 --> 58:25.002
once we got
the darkness last night.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.972
Hasn't let up since.

58:31.542 --> 58:34.879
Seems to me,
just reading into the pattern

58:34.912 --> 58:37.214
of the last
six-eight hours, Tommy,

58:37.247 --> 58:40.851
that the Ford seems to be a bit
susceptible to the cooler conditions

58:40.885 --> 58:45.022
and running behind the pace car,
hasn't got a lot of tire temp in there.

58:45.055 --> 58:49.026
The track conditions aren't
that high either right now, so,

58:49.059 --> 58:51.596
seems like the car's not quite
coming to life as quickly

58:51.629 --> 58:54.031
as the Ferrari
has been all night.

58:54.064 --> 58:56.701
Which kind of keep
to our thesis

58:56.734 --> 59:00.705
that it maybe is between compounds
and would like a softer one right now

59:00.738 --> 59:03.708
in these conditions.
Now, if things get warmer,

59:03.741 --> 59:06.076
does that put them
right in their sweet spot,

59:06.110 --> 59:07.712
and start to take the Ferrari
out of theirs,

59:07.745 --> 59:09.213
is maybe the question.

59:09.246 --> 59:11.816
If you base it on yesterday afternoon,
you'd say so.

59:14.218 --> 59:17.387
Le Mans born and bred,
Sebastien Bourdais,

59:17.421 --> 59:22.760
trying to run down Toni Vilander
in the class-leading Ferrari.

59:22.793 --> 59:26.764
He doesn't like being second.
He's finished second three times overall,

59:26.797 --> 59:28.899
running for Peugeot.

59:28.933 --> 59:32.837
And the Frenchman,
whose hometown is Le Mans,

59:32.870 --> 59:35.906
wants that one position
ahead of the Ferrari.

59:41.846 --> 59:43.180
For me,
it's really tough

59:43.213 --> 59:45.850
because I've been dominating
this space so many times

59:45.883 --> 59:50.054
and came short
within the last few hours,

59:50.087 --> 59:53.891
or something's gone wrong
in the morning, or whatever,

59:53.924 --> 59:56.994
and it's just one of those
where you're kind of

59:57.027 --> 59:59.864
dreading almost the moment where
it's just gonna go haywire.

59:59.897 --> 01:00:05.770
And you kind of almost start to feel that
there might be a curse or something.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:09.840
Last time I was in the car around from
6:00-9:00 am. or something like that,

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:15.145
the computer went bananas and now I had,
like, no information.

01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:18.482
Speedometer
wasn't working anymore,

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:22.019
so I had to come through the
pits at a guesstimated speed

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:25.155
'cause the display wasn't
displaying anything anymore.

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:27.725
And I couldn't
stop the car, and...

01:00:29.694 --> 01:00:31.095
This is happening again.

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:35.966
We're having trouble with
the electronics in the car,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.803
and so much of it goes through
our steering wheel,

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:40.004
including when we come
into the pits.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:43.107
The drivers shut the engine off
through the steering wheel,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.575
and only then are we allowed
to refuel the car.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:49.079
So the rule says,
engine must be off while we're refueling.

01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.151
And when he came in,

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.221
the engine didn't shut off.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.713
- That's it.
- That is huge!

01:01:22.747 --> 01:01:27.017
That's Dirk Muller,
that's the second-place GTE Pro entry.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.286
And they'll have
to come to pit lane.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:36.593
Right now, the gap, only 12.5 seconds
in GTE Pro, but this is huge for Ford.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.163
Having to serve
a penalty at Le Mans means

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.265
that you have to exit
the race track,

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:44.334
your race speed dropped
to pit lane speed,

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:46.536
drive all the way
down pit lane,

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.706
and then, get yourself back up
to speed again in a safe manner.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.441
It can cost you
at least 30 seconds.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:13.163
That's what separates racing
from every other sport.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:15.365
You can hit the worst shot
in the history of golf,

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:18.235
and still win the Masters
on one of your shots.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.906
You can throw an absolutely atrocious
pass and win the Super Bowl.

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:28.112
If you have a bad corner
at Le Mans, you're not winning.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:32.249
We talk about mistakes that can
take you out of this event.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.185
Did Ford just make a
mistake on pit lane?

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.354
We'll have to see
how that pans out.

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.557
You've got plenty of time left,
you've had a problem,

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.426
over six hours to go,

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:45.029
and you come in,
you take your medicine,

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:47.764
and now you focus forward
on getting the job done again.

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:48.899
And you make up that distance.

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:52.436
You can't let that
affect you mentally.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:02.679
The car's very easy on its tires,
which we designed it that way,

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:05.916
but it also means it doesn't
always get heat in the tires,

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.784
particularly on a cold night.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:10.955
And as it warmed up,
we knew the car was gonna get faster,

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:14.024
and so, we knew we still had
a good chance of catching him,

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:17.161
but it was gonna require us to
run flat-out from that point.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:23.733
Dirk got that message,
and he just ran lap after lap after lap

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.503
and cut into that lead,
and I think by the time

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:31.808
he handed the car over he had cut almost
a minute down to only 15 seconds or so.

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:02.439
Joey Hand,
now behind the wheel of the 68,

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:05.475
as he hunts down
Matteo Malucelli.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.644
You ride on board
with Joey right now,

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:11.949
and the car that you see in front
is the bright, red number 82.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:15.285
This is for the lead
in GTE Pro at Le Mans.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:28.198
As the weather continues
to warm up throughout the day,

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:31.535
expect the Ford to get better
and better and better,

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:34.538
and that is not good news
for the Ferrari camp.

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:44.281
This is right up my wheelhouse.
This is where I live, right here.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:47.584
Going to chase somebody down
and pass him.

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.620
That point in the race,
you're starting to wind down.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.992
When you pass somebody
for the lead,

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.893
that could be the pass.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:05:00.364
If you have a car that can go run
somebody down, pass him, and keep going,

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.199
they're gonna
have to catch you, right?

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.934
There's not gonna be
any freebies.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.072
The Ford accelerates, it seems,
to about the same level.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.407
But eventually
the Ferrari gets to a plateau

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.609
and the Ford just seems
to keep pulling.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.315
Ah, it's working.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:42.306
Get him, Joey!

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.608
Yeah!

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:57.587
Ford versus Ferrari.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:00.190
It feels like
it's 50 years ago.

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:02.459
Now, we'll have to wait
until the end of the race,

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:06.196
but the cars look good,
and, we're very optimistic.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:24.548
Ryan Briscoe,
aboard the 69,

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:28.585
so, in the top three
right now in GTE Pro.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:31.455
There's Ford, Ferrari,
and Ford.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:37.794
So, the two U.S. based cars
from Ford Chip Ganassi

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.297
in the top three.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:47.704
Oh, and problems for the 82,
Toni Vilander.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.042
That is a big spin.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.911
This is what's scary right now.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:59.416
Hopefully, people are paying attention
to the yellows. And Vilander

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:02.252
trying to get out of the way,
and then back on track.

01:07:02.286 --> 01:07:04.088
This is also huge for Ford.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.990
You can't give away

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:11.061
anything to competitors like this
that you're running up against,

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:13.430
or Ford will say,
"Thank you very much," and take that,

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.365
and capitalize on it
big time.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:25.041
Yeah, Ferrari's made that little
spin and given us a little breather.

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.411
I think the race has
switched a little bit.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.380
Now it's gonna be
a pure reliability match and,

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:32.682
the pace seems to be
very evenly matched,

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:36.120
so, fingers crossed
and bring it home right now.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:39.523
Just kind of sit tight,
let the guys figure it out.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.359
Now, there's nothing I can do anymore.
Just watch and,

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:44.228
and hope.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.699
Before Vilander spun,
it was just over five seconds,

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:53.737
it's now two minutes and five
seconds that that cost them.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.175
Huge.
And what it does is it moves

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:01.745
Toni Vilander back closer

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:05.949
to Ryan Briscoe in the 69,
so it's like, one moment

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:09.085
you're trying to hang on to the lead,
and the next moment,

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:12.822
you're trying to recover from the
mistake and hang on to second place.

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:47.055
Two hours to go.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:51.194
To this point,
Ford has been nearly flawless.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.397
Dirk Muller going in.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.640
Joey helping him out.

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:08.144
Muller should be in
now until the checker.

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:10.046
Two hours left.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.916
Joey gives him a pat, and says,
"Have a good one, brother."

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:22.759
Meanwhile, the 82 in second,
not about to give up the fight.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:05.702
I tried to go slow, to be honest,
but I was making little mistakes.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:08.505
I just told myself,
"Do your normal pace."

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:13.510
I mean, if the car is not able to do
ten more laps, I mean, then, that's it.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.245
I had to be focused.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.087
Let's go to Andrew Marriott.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.091
Well, Raj, I can't say
you got a smile on your face,

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:31.328
'cause I'm sure your heart's
in your mouth at the moment.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:36.065
Yeah, we've got 37 minutes to go,
and maybe I'll smile then.

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:37.501
Keep everything crossed, Raj.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:39.469
Yeah, I've got all my fingers
and toes crossed.

01:10:39.503 --> 01:10:41.137
Thank you.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.508
Sounded nervous, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:47.511
2003,
we had about a two-lap lead.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:50.113
I came in
for the last pit stop,

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:54.217
and the center lock nut
that holds the wheel on,

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.852
it rolled underneath the car

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.322
sharp side up.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:03.693
It's hard to tell that story
because that's how I lost the race,

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:07.697
but the sharp edge punctured right
through the carbon fiber body

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.967
into the oil pan,
and all the oil came out of the car.

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:18.207
What it takes to get to Le Mans
and to be in a winning car

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.576
in a winning position

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.746
and have it taken away
from you and know

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.882
that will never happen.
"I will never win Le Mans."

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:29.453
That was a tough pill,
because I knew this was ours.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.839
When I was really little,
probably about four or five,

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:53.477
I remember my father
coming home, and,

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:56.212
he was so excited
to tell me about it

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.882
and what a great win
it'd been for Ford.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:02.352
And I remember thinking
"I wish I'd been there."

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:22.739
Oh, my God!

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:31.615
Fifty years, baby!

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.157
It's like a dream come true,
this weekend.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.893
I mean, that's something
you will never ever

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:46.463
dream about. I mean,

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:48.798
it's crazy.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.900
I think we have achieved
something big here today.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:01.144
This is as good as it gets.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:04.548
When we approved this program,
we did it to come race here in Le Mans.

01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:07.451
And I think we proved
it was the right decision.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:10.186
We did what
we came here to do.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.156
We did it for our employees,
and our families,

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:14.824
and everybody who loves Ford.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.093
I hope they're proud of us.

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:21.064
Sebastien Bourdais.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:25.301
Sebastien's dad, Patrick,
drove in this race.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:29.873
When you race for so many people,
and you feel that there's

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.709
kind of a greatness
in the whole thing,

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:36.245
it's just something
I've never experienced before.

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:40.584
And to be able to see how much
it meant to the Ford Family,

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:43.086
it was just priceless.

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:46.723
I think back 50 years to my father,
who I was there with,

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.392
and I think he would be
extremely proud.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.796
And he would have been even prouder
the minute we passed that Ferrari.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:55.832
What a moment.
I mean, you know.

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:59.969
I have to sort of take a hold of myself.
That was really incredible.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:06.142
Holy cow,
we won Le Mans, you know?

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.310
You dream about this stuff,

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:09.713
you try and picture yourself
in the moment.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:14.283
It's crazy to think about the amount
of people it took to get here.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:17.921
I don't know how to feel yet,
but I know it feels good.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.322
It was about
coming back to Le Mans

01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:23.192
and showing that, we, as Ford Motor Company,
had what it takes to win.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:25.028
It took all of us
to make this happen.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:28.097
Every one of those people
and every one of those garages

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:31.601
put the Ford GT across the finish line.
That I do know.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:33.136
This is what
it means to be a team.
