WEBVTT

00:29.739 --> 00:31.775
Sookie. It's me.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.905
Sookie. Sookie, it's me.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.570
-Bi||--
-You hurt?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.119
Come here.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.900
-Get your fucking hands off me.
-What are you doing here?

01:09.070 --> 01:12.153
I was making sure Sookie got home safe.
The door was open.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.438
What are you doing here?

01:13.616 --> 01:15.447
Bill, it's okay. Let him go.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.826
SooMe?

01:23.793 --> 01:24.828
What happened?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.836
-Did you get any prints off that drawer?
-Nothing clean.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.005
We got a partial one on the sink, though.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.889
Hey.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.431
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down?
They're gonna be in there a while.

03:11.609 --> 03:15.318
As soon as we find anything out,
I'll let you know.

03:15.488 --> 03:18.275
-Oh, shit, I got blood on my boots.
-So much blood.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.985
Adele was a good person.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.276
Pull it together. Do your job.
No wonder they don 't respect you.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.787
Cut her up real good. Must be thirty stabs.
Throat's wide open.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.118
Holy hell, we've got ourselves
a serial killer.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.158
Took Gran and the grandkids
to the lake--

03:31.337 --> 03:35.455
Poor woman, stuck raising those bat-shit
crazy Stackhouse kids didn’t deserve this.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.169
I knew ever since--

03:37.343 --> 03:39.004
SooMe?

03:42.515 --> 03:46.508
Maybe I could use a little air.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.797
I should never have left you alone.
I lost my temper and I shouldn't have.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.308
Do you think you could
apologize to me some other time?

04:31.188 --> 04:32.769
ljust....

04:34.024 --> 04:37.266
Whatever you need, anything I can do,
you know I'm right here.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.026
I know.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.320
Thank you.

04:41.490 --> 04:45.278
--hold you, make it better.
I'm the one. So sorry. Soft, soft skin--

04:48.581 --> 04:50.287
I said another time, Sam.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.036
Okay.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.331
What happened to Bill?

05:05.556 --> 05:06.545
I'll go get him.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.383
Thank you.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.566
She's asking for you.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.651
There something you wanna say to me?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.910
I want you to stay away from her.

05:34.084 --> 05:38.077
You know, Sookie doesn't take kindly
to people making decisions for her.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.671
You don't need to tell me who Sookie is.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.588
I know who she is.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.754
I've known a long time.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.391
Well, then you'll also know that this is
neither the time nor the place...

05:52.561 --> 05:54.722
...for you to mark your territory.

05:54.897 --> 05:59.436
There's a woman lying dead downstairs.
She wouldn't be there if it weren't for you.

06:01.946 --> 06:05.438
Anything happens to Sookie, I promise...

06:05.616 --> 06:08.232
...|'|| be sharpening a stake
with your name on it.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.842
Looks like she put up a hell of a fight.

06:29.306 --> 06:33.140
See those defensive cuts on her hands?
Straight to the bone.

06:33.769 --> 06:34.758
Hardcore.

06:35.104 --> 06:38.141
Psycho son of a bitch,
going after an old lady that way.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.103
-Just about the sickest thing I ever seen.
-No.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.485
I've seen worse.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.068
There was a murder about six years ago.
Lady snapped.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.359
Blew her husband's head off
while he was watching the game.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.994
Big chunks of brain all over the TV.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.999
Why'd she do it?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.782
I guess she wanted to watch
something else.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.952
How the hell would I know, Andy?

07:01.130 --> 07:04.167
People don't murder because
they're right in the head.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.083
I told you we never should have released
Jason Stackhouse.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.593
Come on, this is his grandma
we're talking about.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.845
You think that little pervert ain't capable?

07:12.016 --> 07:14.678
Well, Adele did bring
the fanger into a church.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.389
Sure that ruffled more than a few feathers.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.973
If he didn't do it himself...

07:19.148 --> 07:21.514
-But Vampire Bill said--
-Vampire Bill?

07:21.692 --> 07:24.525
You on a first-name basis
with that bloodsucker, now?

07:24.695 --> 07:26.856
These things are crafty.

07:27.031 --> 07:30.068
They've been killing long enough
to know how to cover their tracks.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.700
-Am I interrupting?
-Mr. Compton, this is an official crime scene.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.908
-You can't be in here.
-lt's all right, Andy.

07:37.082 --> 07:41.872
I suspect Vampire Bill's
been around a dead body or two before.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.037
Isn't that right, sir?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.716
Friend of yours, wasn't she?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.052
Yes. I suppose she was.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.886
We got a couple more questions for you.
You mind?

07:57.061 --> 07:59.302
No. Not at all.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.806
Sookie tells us you were here
when she found the body.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.101
-ls that right?
-I arrived a few moments after.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.736
Kind of late to be making house calls.

08:11.283 --> 08:16.778
-Oh, right. I guess you don't sleep, huh?
-They sleep. Just not at night.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.699
So you make a habit of visiting
Miss Stackhouse in the middle of the night?

08:21.877 --> 08:24.835
We had certain personal matters to discuss.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.497
After you left my home, l was waiting
for her to return from her engagement.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.917
When I heard a car,
I came across the cemetery.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.053
You're saying you heard a car coming
from across the cemetery?

08:34.223 --> 08:36.965
Heightened senses are a common
side effect of our condition.

08:37.142 --> 08:41.932
But you didn't see or hear
any other vehicles coming from the house?

08:42.106 --> 08:44.097
-Something like a truck, maybe?
-No.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.607
A lot of folks wouldn't be too keen
on a vampire moving in next door...

08:47.778 --> 08:52.613
...but Adele Stackhouse, she welcomed you
with open arms, didn't she?

08:53.784 --> 08:55.445
She was very gracious, yes.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.120
So....

08:58.288 --> 09:01.701
Maudette Pickens, Dawn Green,
Adele Stackhouse...

09:01.875 --> 09:06.039
...they were all very gracious
to your people.

09:06.213 --> 09:10.001
That's just about the one thing
they had in common.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.633
Now, is that one hell of a
plus-sized coincidence or what?

09:13.804 --> 09:14.964
I don't believe so, no.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.799
Excuse me?

09:16.974 --> 09:21.593
I suspect whoever did this is targeting
women who associate with vampires.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.438
You can't be serious.
Adele Stackhouse and a vamp?

09:26.942 --> 09:30.651
Oh, I don't think Sookie's grandmother
was the intended victim.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.072
I should probably call Jason.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.742
Well, I can do it if you like.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.916
Thank you.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.482
This is Stackhouse, you know what to do.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.946
To leave a voice message...

10:21.121 --> 10:24.909
-Bi|l, what's going on?
-They're about to move your grandmother.

10:31.215 --> 10:35.675
Sookie, you might wanna go sleep
at a friend's, someplace less isolated.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.960
I'm not going anywhere.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.634
-Sookie, perhaps the detective--
-No, this is my house.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.391
-l'm staying right here.
-Turn her there. All right.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.267
Coming through.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.987
God, I hope she didn’t recognize me
at that vampire bar.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.319
l/ooked different,
and she was fangbanging--

11:00.494 --> 11:02.735
It's dumb luck you're not in that bag
right now...

11:02.913 --> 11:05.700
...screwing that vampire.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.159
You could be next.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.157
We're truly sorry
about your grandmother.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.952
Are y'all done in there?
Because I'd like to clean up.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.916
If that's all right.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.877
All right, then.

11:16.969 --> 11:20.257
You call us at the first sign of anything.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.840
-Keep an eye on her.
-I will.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.430
-They are right. You should not stay here.
-I agree.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.095
You can have my trailer,
l'll sleep at the bar.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.519
I'm as safe here as anywhere.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.231
Besides, I've got both of you
to protect me, haven't I?

11:36.738 --> 11:38.444
SooMe”.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.438
...I have to go.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.322
Of course.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.952
It's almost dawn.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.870
I will come back. Later.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.626
I can take it from here.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.594
Don't worry about me.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.096
Go.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.905
There's an extra mop round back.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.815
-Would you mind getting it?
-SooMe.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.360
Gran took a lot of pride in her home.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.995
She wouldn't want anyone
to see it like this.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.626
Oh, hey, that looks great.
Why don't--

13:24.805 --> 13:27.217
-Why don't you put it in the kitchen?
-It is so sad.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.679
That Stackhouse girl
hasn't come out of the kitchen.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.104
Well, I heard that she hasn't cried
a single tear.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.559
Well, you know she's been
going around with that vampire.

13:43.699 --> 13:47.533
Oh, Mrs. Fortenberry, you shouldn't have.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.659
You poor child.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.367
I am so sorry for your loss.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.122
That's very kind of you.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.289
Gran often talked about you, so....

13:58.463 --> 13:59.498
Thank you.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.756
Yeah, because nothing says I'm sorry
like a tuna-cheese casserole.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.666
Another one?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.052
Have you seen Jason? Is he here yet?

14:07.222 --> 14:10.259
How the hell should I know?
I ain't his keeper.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.093
Bitch.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.058
Adele was just an angel sent from heaven.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.018
Too good for this world.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.103
We're all gonna miss her so much.

14:21.278 --> 14:24.236
I heard they almost cut off her head.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.943
I don’t see any blood.
I should've gotten here sooner.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.779
Maybe I should have brought
my red velvet cake instead.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.238
Excuse me.

14:33.623 --> 14:37.616
Oh, Sookie. Ijust can't believe it.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.455
Are you all right?

14:39.629 --> 14:42.371
-I'm fine, Arlene. Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.631
It's the least I could do.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.292
Oh, you poor thing.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.463
I can't imagine what you're going through.

14:51.641 --> 14:56.510
Now, if you need help with moving
or anything at all....

14:56.688 --> 14:58.804
I'm not moving, I'm not moving.

14:59.941 --> 15:03.433
But, honey. With it happening right here....

15:03.612 --> 15:06.319
I have more good memories
of this kitchen than bad ones.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.323
Oh, what a good way to look at it.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.656
You know, you really are smarter
than anyone gives you credit for.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.158
Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean it like that.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.669
Maxine Fortenberry,
you put that pie down right now!

15:22.839 --> 15:25.581
-What's going on?
-Come here. She's losing it.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.131
This is Gran's pie!

15:32.974 --> 15:36.341
Well, I'm sorry.
I was just making some room.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.513
-The girl is crazy as a bedbug.
-We all know you killed your grandmother.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.851
After I spent all morning
making this casserole.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.436
--would even show her face--

15:44.611 --> 15:48.149
Would y'all excuse us?
I need Sookie upstairs.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.156
--too bad you can't just shoot a person.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.658
Just give us a little girl-time.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.453
Come on, Lafayette.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.618
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.288
Don't feel sorry for yelling
at that snoopy old bitch.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.798
She's been sticking her nose
where it don't belong.

16:08.969 --> 16:12.336
I mean, if she talked any more shit,
she'd be shaped like a toilet.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.385
Gran's gone.

16:20.564 --> 16:22.395
She's really gone.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.397
Yeah, she is.

16:27.571 --> 16:30.313
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.905
-Can't even think straight.
-Well, of course you can't.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.912
How can you
with all these circling buzzards?

16:39.082 --> 16:42.791
You know, you're not their entertainment.
You don't have to dance for them.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.043
You just gotta feel whatever you're feeling.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.334
I'm not sure I'm...

16:48.508 --> 16:50.999
...feeling anything.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.046
I'm just numb.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.260
-Numb is good.
-Yeah.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.643
Numb is probably exactly what
you need right now.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.608
Stop worrying about being
so damn appropriate.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.107
This is not an appropriate event.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.191
Thank you for getting me out of there.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.574
I haven't had a single minute of silence.

17:23.418 --> 17:27.036
Can't seem to block anything out right now.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.375
You want me to tell
them to shut the hell up?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.757
-| wish it were that easy.
-It is.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.087
Your wish is my command.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.129
Oh, no. I don't do drugs.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.766
Sook. Relax. This is not drugs.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.474
This is just a Valium.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.059
I'll tell you what. Put it on your nightstand
just in case you change your mind.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.359
I'm gonna go and check
on the circling buzzards.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.275
-Lafayette?
-Yes, ma'am.

17:59.621 --> 18:03.580
Would you mind taking this
downstairs for me?

18:04.668 --> 18:07.034
I will guard it with my life.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.641
Holy shit. This ain't no good.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.699
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm late.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.451
My alarm broke
and I couldn't find my phone.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.116
-Jason.Jason.
-Yeah?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.368
What you doing here?

18:51.047 --> 18:52.127
My job.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.924
Fuck.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.380
He don't know, him.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.304
Man, I am so sorry.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.186
About what?

19:10.483 --> 19:13.065
You want me to call anyone?
Your cousin Hadley?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.602
No one's heard from her in over a year.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.943
Since she ran away from that rehab
Gran paid for.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.403
I don't even know
how to get hold of her.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.162
-What about Bill? You gonna invite him?
-Tara, he can't go.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.083
-Right.
-It's not like you've known a lot of vampires.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.244
Kind of takes getting used to.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.913
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to it.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.003
What? So not everyone
is as open-minded as you.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.635
Shoot me.
You should hear the things...

19:40.805 --> 19:42.511
-...people are saying.
-I do.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.680
-Bill did not kill my grandmother.
-Don't you get all mad at me.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.719
Nobody is blaming Bill.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.388
Exactly.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.807
Didn't you tell me he has some
scary-ass friends?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.566
Not all vampires are like that.

19:55.737 --> 19:59.275
I'd fucking lose it if anything
happened to you. You know that, right?

20:02.619 --> 20:05.986
Tara, last night was so horrible.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.782
I don't know how I would've gotten
through it if it weren't for Bill.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.117
When I'm around him....

20:13.296 --> 20:16.459
I don't know how to explain it
exactly, but...

20:17.634 --> 20:20.421
...it's like I almost feel normal.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.764
-What the fuck...?
-Is he all right there?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.637
Jason.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.771
-What the fuck?
-It's your fault.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.809
Gran is dead because of you.
It should have been you!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.647
Bitch, don't you lay a hand on her.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.313
She's screwing a vampire, Tara.
A fucking vampire!

20:41.491 --> 20:44.449
Yeah, well, that vampire was there for her
when you weren't.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.234
You ought to be ashamed.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.655
Is that how your grandma raised you?
To beat on your own sister?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.825
Look at you.
I don't even recognize you anymore.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.790
Get out! Get out!

21:02.971 --> 21:04.677
You okay?

21:23.450 --> 21:26.988
-Stackhouse? I need to ask you questions.
-Not now, Andy.

21:27.162 --> 21:29.448
-Where were you last night?
-I don't know.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.874
-I was with a girl.
-Tara Thornton?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.372
What? No.

21:34.461 --> 21:37.168
Yeah. I didn't think so.
What's this one's name?

21:38.006 --> 21:40.918
I don't remember her name. Okay?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.298
I've got her number.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.632
-I don't know what I did with it, though.
-Well, ain't that convenient.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.265
What the hell
is that supposed to mean, Andy?

21:50.435 --> 21:54.724
It's Detective Bellefleur.
And what the fuck do you think it means?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.598
Are you saying I killed my grandmother?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.407
You is a stupid bitch, Jason Stackhouse.

22:18.963 --> 22:23.923
Jason Stackhouse tossed Andy Bellefleur
like he was nothing but a rag doll.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.800
Rene makes me watch
that Friday Night Smackdown with him.

22:26.971 --> 22:31.385
Those men are built thicker than walls,
but I've never seen one of them do that.

22:31.559 --> 22:36.724
Well, you know, Jason, he work out a lot.
He's real strong.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.724
All right, everybody. Sookie needs her rest.

22:41.903 --> 22:44.519
It's time for y'all to go now.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.155
What the hell are you all staring at?
You heard me. The sideshow is over.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.692
Let's go. Let's go.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.862
We appreciate y'all coming out,
we love y'all. Come on, let's go.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.405
Let's go. Thank you.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.037
That means you too, Sam.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.498
Look, I get it.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.134
But right now, she needs to be alone.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.467
All right. Well, if there's anything I can do,
you call me.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.347
You're a good friend.

23:13.518 --> 23:16.305
Now get the fuck out of here. Please.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.769
All right.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.645
Don't make me throw y'all out myself,
because you know I will.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.152
I heard you, Tara.

23:31.953 --> 23:35.241
What the fuck is it
with white people and Jell-O?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.326
I don't understand.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.992
-What the hell are we gonna do with all this?
-Toss it.

23:41.170 --> 23:45.834
-Sookie don't need no bad-juju cooking.
-Bad juju?

23:46.009 --> 23:49.501
A way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. That shit true as gold.

23:49.679 --> 23:52.011
Put some love in your food
and folk can taste it.

23:52.181 --> 23:57.926
Smell this. You can smell the fear
and nastiness coming off that cornbread.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.887
Taste just fine to me.

24:01.065 --> 24:04.023
See, bitch, you gonna wish
you ain't did that. Watch.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.448
Bill....

24:56.204 --> 24:58.536
Maybe I should go check on Sookie.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.914
Trust me. That child
is dead to the world right now.

25:03.753 --> 25:04.868
What the fuck?

25:07.632 --> 25:09.168
SooMeISooMe!

25:09.342 --> 25:12.926
-What the hell are you doing?
-SooMe!SooMe!SooMe!

25:13.096 --> 25:14.757
SooMeISooMen

25:19.894 --> 25:21.509
Bill, what's wrong?

25:22.522 --> 25:24.103
Ithought”.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.853
I had a dream. That's all.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.270
-You go back to sleep.
-But I....

25:32.448 --> 25:34.404
You don't worry.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.404
I'm not going anywhere.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.704
Go on.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.976
Do you think they're capable
of loving a person?

26:19.287 --> 26:21.403
Who knows what they're capable of?

27:36.405 --> 27:37.690
Lord...

27:37.865 --> 27:41.232
...we gather here today
to remember the life of Adele Stackhouse.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.072
To celebrate the time
that she enjoyed here on Earth.

27:44.247 --> 27:47.114
And to thank you
for each precious moment--

27:47.291 --> 27:50.909
-Sookie, my hand.
-Sorry. Sorry.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.874
--family, friends.

27:54.048 --> 27:56.755
But even as we grieve,
we shall be comforted...

27:56.926 --> 27:59.417
...knowing that she is at peace
in the Lord's kingdom.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.428
And there shall be no more death.

28:03.599 --> 28:07.262
-Uncle Bartlett, what are you doing here?
-She was my sister.

28:08.437 --> 28:11.429
You haven't been part of this family
in a long time.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.933
Sook, come on. Give the guy a break.

28:15.111 --> 28:18.103
Sookie Stackhouse
has prepared a few words.

28:19.282 --> 28:21.944
Honey? You wanted to say a few words?

28:23.786 --> 28:26.072
Sookie, you are okay?

28:46.475 --> 28:51.595
Adele Stackhouse was everything to me.

28:51.772 --> 28:58.610
She wasn't just my grandmother,
she was my parent, my teacher...

28:58.779 --> 29:00.861
...and my best friend.

29:01.032 --> 29:05.116
Oh, please. If it weren’t for you,
she'd still be alive.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.242
Thought she was a good girl.
You never know.

29:07.413 --> 29:11.531
-How dare you show your face.
-Shame on you for even showing up here.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.950
To say she will be missed...

29:16.505 --> 29:18.996
...just doesn't cut it because...

29:20.384 --> 29:23.751
...I can't even imagine a world
without her in it.

29:25.014 --> 29:27.255
She was always there...

29:27.433 --> 29:31.517
...with a kind word and a hot meal...

29:32.480 --> 29:34.721
...and a shoulder to cry on.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.772
Notjust for me...

29:38.194 --> 29:39.525
Forgive me, Ade/e. Forgive me.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.652
...but for everyone who knew her.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.780
-Never meant to hurt no one. I couldn't help--
-Pathetic thing.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.488
-Can't pretend she's normal.
-As nuts as nuts can be.

29:47.662 --> 29:50.119
-Sleeping with your grandmother's killer.
-Dead because of you.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.665
Shut up!

29:51.832 --> 29:54.323
All of you, just shut the fuck up!

29:57.546 --> 30:00.162
-Look at her, cursing--
-This whole world's just plain crazy.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.547
-Wrong-eyed freak--
-Sookie.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.218
-Oh, my God.
-lt's shameful.

30:03.386 --> 30:07.004
-Lock her up and throw away the key.
-Adele would be rolling in her grave.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.057
Well....

30:15.898 --> 30:19.356
Is there anyone else
who'd care to share a few words?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.648
I've got something to say.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.483
What is she doing?

30:29.245 --> 30:31.577
No, Mama.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.365
Oh, my fucking God, girl.
This is about to get ugly.

30:42.842 --> 30:46.084
I didn't know Ms. Stackhouse
like a lot of you did...

30:47.763 --> 30:50.721
...but the few times I did meet her...

30:53.394 --> 30:55.100
...she was nothing but kind to me.

30:56.772 --> 31:00.606
She was a good, God-fearing woman.

31:05.531 --> 31:09.023
And when I was going
through some bad things...

31:09.201 --> 31:10.941
...my daughter would go stay with her.

31:12.455 --> 31:15.697
And I always knew she'd be just fine.

31:18.961 --> 31:23.045
Adele Stackhouse took care
of my baby when I couldn't...

31:23.215 --> 31:25.251
...and I'll always be grateful for that.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.132
SooMe.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.800
Sookie, just hold up a sec.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.764
Why? So you can hit me again?

31:37.938 --> 31:42.022
Go ahead, tell me how it's all my fault, tell
me how you wish it were me in that coffin.

31:42.193 --> 31:45.151
-I deserve it.
-I'm sorry.

31:49.825 --> 31:52.316
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't touch me.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.612
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you.
You gotta know that.

31:56.791 --> 31:58.327
You invited Uncle Bartlett.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.459
-How could you do that?
-He has the right to be here.

32:02.171 --> 32:04.503
Look, I know he and Gran
had their problems...

32:04.673 --> 32:07.540
...but whatever they were,
it don't matter no more...

32:07.885 --> 32:10.467
...because that's what family does.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.677
We forgive each other.

32:12.848 --> 32:16.136
You have no idea what you're talking about.

32:18.187 --> 32:21.020
Sookie, please.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.431
I mean, we're all we've got.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.150
We've got nothing.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.335
Hey.

32:49.510 --> 32:53.048
I was moved. Very moved.

32:53.222 --> 32:56.635
You should come to our next
Descendants of the Glorious Dead meeting.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.141
That some kind of support group thing?

32:59.311 --> 33:03.554
I went to one of those AA meetings once.
It was nothing but a cult.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.566
Hi, baby. This is my precious daughter Tara.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.569
We've met, like, a hundred times too many.
Excuse us.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.899
-What the hell are you doing?
-Talking to that nice lady.

33:15.077 --> 33:18.365
-Let go of my arm, you're hurting me.
-Oh, I'm hurting you?

33:18.539 --> 33:19.574
That's funny.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.740
Last time I saw you, you were beating
my head in with a bottle.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.580
Oh, sweet Jesus.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.830
You poor child.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.751
I am so sorry.

33:38.100 --> 33:41.843
You had no right to speak for that woman.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.517
She was more of a mother to me
than you ever were.

33:45.691 --> 33:51.186
She took care of me.
She fed me, she put clothes on me.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.196
She called social services on you twice.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.618
-You hated her guts.
-No.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.400
-I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

33:58.579 --> 34:01.116
-You used to call her a white-devil bitch.
-No, Tara.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.453
That wasn't me.
That wasn't me that said those things.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.959
You were drunk.
Don't mean it never happened.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.541
Please, baby, just listen.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.968
All those terrible things I did to you...

34:17.139 --> 34:18.640
...it wasn't me who did them.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.471
I have a demon inside of me.

34:25.314 --> 34:28.431
-What?
-A demon.

34:28.609 --> 34:32.978
Living and breathing inside me.
Eating me up.

34:36.492 --> 34:40.576
Don't you laugh at the devil, Tara,
because he's as serious as cancer.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.455
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You have a demon inside you?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.331
Oh, fuck me. That's too good.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.958
It ain't funny.

34:48.128 --> 34:52.667
You have no idea what I go through,
wrestling with this demon.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.332
I try and do right.

34:55.511 --> 34:59.299
I try so hard, but it breaks me down.

34:59.932 --> 35:03.095
It poisons everything.

35:05.521 --> 35:08.604
I wanna be the mama you deserve.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.355
I can make up for everything.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.517
I can. It's not too late.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.528
But I can't do this alone.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.024
Do what?

35:21.328 --> 35:23.660
I gotta get it out of me...

35:25.249 --> 35:26.989
...and it is very expensive.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.795
And that's why you came
to this woman's funeral?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.297
Because you want money?

35:38.220 --> 35:39.721
I had nowhere else to go.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.721
Tara. Tara, please.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.382
Don't walk away from me.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.051
I am still your mama.

35:48.564 --> 35:51.055
I need you.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.563
You're all I got.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.937
I'm so sorry.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.285
Adele was a saint.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.785
Sorry for your loss.

36:51.126 --> 36:55.119
-We're not done, Stackhouse.
-What?

36:56.215 --> 36:58.581
Oh, fuck.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.586
Fuck! Fuck!

37:55.023 --> 37:56.979
Oh, Shit.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.938
Fuck!

38:29.600 --> 38:31.136
Hey.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.017
Hey.

38:36.023 --> 38:38.264
I was looking for you.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.023
Well...

38:40.903 --> 38:42.894
...you found me.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.987
I liked your speech.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.618
What I heard of it, anyway.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.535
I especially liked the part where you told
the whole town to shut the fuck up.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.668
Yeah, I'm a real crowd pleaser.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.844
Hey, I'll walk you home.

39:42.965 --> 39:45.251
So how about you take a bath...

39:45.425 --> 39:49.338
...I'II find us some stupid movie on TV,
something with aliens?

39:50.097 --> 39:52.383
-Romantic comedy, then?
-Sam, not now.

39:52.975 --> 39:54.431
Ijust....

39:54.977 --> 39:56.467
I need to be alone.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.645
Thanks.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.994
She said she wants to be alone.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.337
Well, I don't.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.302
Me either.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.456
I won't ever give you
another goddamn chicken.

43:07.335 --> 43:08.586
-Hi.
-Hey, Roger.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.005
I never even touched that bitch.

43:11.173 --> 43:16.338
Oh, don't you lie to me, you piece of shit.
I'll fucking kill you.

43:16.511 --> 43:19.173
Don't worry. She says that all the time.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.859
Come on, you gotta admit,
it has a certain charm.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.236
You live here?

43:39.409 --> 43:43.903
-You want a beer? They're warm.
-Yeah. Sure.

43:48.043 --> 43:50.250
Is this really where you live?

43:51.880 --> 43:54.542
Yes, Sam. This is really where I live.

43:54.716 --> 43:56.217
You trying to make me feel bad?

43:56.384 --> 43:58.966
No. No, it's just....

44:00.222 --> 44:02.884
-I thought you were staying with Lafayette.
-I was.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.720
Do you know he has
a webcam in his bathroom?

44:05.894 --> 44:08.306
No way I'm letting a bunch
of perverts watch me pee.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.815
You should have told me
you needed somewhere to stay.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.024
Why?

44:19.199 --> 44:22.407
So you can ride up on your white horse
and save me?

44:23.870 --> 44:26.111
-Why do you do that?
-Do what?

44:27.290 --> 44:29.747
Try and turn everything into a fight.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.868
Why is it so hard
to just let someone be nice to you?

44:34.589 --> 44:38.207
I don't know, Sam.
You think maybe I have bad self-esteem?

44:38.385 --> 44:41.877
Maybe it's the only way I know
how to express my real feelings.

44:45.934 --> 44:49.051
-I should go.
-Would you relax? I was only teasing.

44:49.229 --> 44:52.437
-Maybe I'm sick of being teased.
-Stay.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.515
-Please.
-What for?

44:55.694 --> 44:57.901
Because I want you to.

45:00.282 --> 45:02.739
Well, I don't wanna play games.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.117
I don't want no strings.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.613
Ijust....

45:09.791 --> 45:12.282
I want something real in my life.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.621
And you think I don't?

45:20.719 --> 45:22.755
If we do this...

45:23.597 --> 45:25.963
...we really did this.

47:28.805 --> 47:31.638
-Holy shit.
-|'|| take that as a compliment.

47:31.808 --> 47:33.890
I guess I really needed that.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.346
Me too. Let's do it again.

47:36.521 --> 47:39.684
-Knew you'd come back.
-I had to baby, I'm sorry. I love you.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.723
I love you too. I need you.

47:41.901 --> 47:44.278
I need you so fucking much.
You're all I've got.

47:44.446 --> 47:46.778
I guess they made up.

47:46.948 --> 47:49.280
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

47:50.285 --> 47:53.277
Listen, I gotta go.

47:54.664 --> 47:55.744
What?

47:56.458 --> 47:58.949
It's the middle of the night.

47:59.127 --> 48:00.913
What just happened?
Did I do something?

48:01.087 --> 48:02.952
It's not about you.

48:03.673 --> 48:05.413
I'm sorry.

48:08.136 --> 48:10.252
I'll see you at work, okay?

48:13.725 --> 48:15.056
This feels so good.

48:16.853 --> 48:18.764
Oh, God.

48:20.315 --> 48:22.226
I love you.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.610
I love you.

49:29.217 --> 49:31.799
Is--? Is something wrong?

50:16.973 --> 50:18.554
Hi, Mom.

50:22.187 --> 50:24.394
I knew you'd come.

50:48.463 --> 50:51.125
Do it. I want you to.
