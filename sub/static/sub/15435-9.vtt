00:00.920 --> 00:02.710
Previously on "Brothers & Sisters"...

00:02.790 --> 00:06.470
Whatever is happening
between you and tommy,end it.

00:06.570 --> 00:07.990
You're insinuating
he's having an affair.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.590
- Just draw your own conclusion.
- I will.

00:09.670 --> 00:12.060
Can we go back to the way things were?

00:12.130 --> 00:13.310
I want to.

00:13.390 --> 00:15.070
I should probably get outta here.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.450
Screw it.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.320
- Let's go out.
- Good.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.320
'Cause I couldn't stand
to wait another 40 years.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.220
I let people believe that I was a hero.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.210
I'm not.

00:25.290 --> 00:26.940
Robert doesn't know that
he's being blackmailed.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.750
Just because you stop me from telling
people doesn't mean it's not the truth.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.260
The senator is a fraud.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.750
Kitty's an old friend.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.800
Not much I wouldn't do for her.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.550
I finally spoke with jason.

00:37.610 --> 00:38.770
I broke up with him.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.380
But I want to be with you.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.150
No,it inot a potluck.

00:43.190 --> 00:46.120
- Did you give the stylist directions?
- I just don't want a repeat of the engagement party,

00:46.200 --> 00:48.970
- Where every family member brought tupperware.
- Probably an updo. I haven't totally decided.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.590
- But,mom,she really does. She really has to be there at 1:00.
- Yes,there'll be a caterer.

00:51.650 --> 00:54.490
- Why don't you just come and try to enjoy yourself,okay?
- Okay,and,um,

00:54.570 --> 00:57.270
I'm gonna be at the house,in a
couple of hours. I love you,too.

00:57.330 --> 00:59.200
Bye.

00:59.820 --> 01:02.980
Okay,well,did you- Did you tell your uncle
that he's not allowed to bring any food?

01:03.040 --> 01:05.690
Yes,I did. Our wedding is
officially artichoke-Free.

01:05.750 --> 01:06.980
Oh,well,thank god.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.320
Hey,you don't have to spend
the night at your mom'S.

01:09.410 --> 01:10.280
Oh,yes,I do.

01:10.340 --> 01:14.040
It's very bad luck to make mad,passionate
love to the groom the night before the wedding.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.860
Yes,because after the
wedding,it is all downhill.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.210
I'm gonna stop bringing you flowers. You're
gonna bust out the housecoats,

01:20.290 --> 01:22.680
And we're gonna start leaving
the bathroom door open- Ew!

01:22.740 --> 01:25.690
Now stop. I don't even
have any housecoats.

01:25.730 --> 01:26.720
Good.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.890
Okay,let's see.

01:29.950 --> 01:33.360
All right,well,I guess I'm ready.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.170
This is...

01:35.230 --> 01:37.570
Okay. Okay,well...

01:37.610 --> 01:39.270
I love you.

01:39.330 --> 01:42.330
And,um,I just- I want
our lives to be just-

01:42.410 --> 01:45.690
Hey,why don't you
save this for our vows?

01:45.750 --> 01:47.480
Vows?

01:47.580 --> 01:49.510
Come on,robert. Now we already decided...

01:49.590 --> 01:51.380
We are going the traditional route.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.780
I've done the whole
traditional wedding vow thing.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.890
I want something...

01:56.970 --> 01:58.170
Different.

01:58.230 --> 01:59.920
You already wrote your vows,didn't you?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.280
Yeah,a little bit.

02:01.590 --> 02:03.360
But listen,if it's too
last-Minute,you know...

02:03.420 --> 02:05.610
It's-No,well,yes,it
is.

02:05.660 --> 02:06.860
It is short notice.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.820
Come on. You've written
entire speeches in 30 minutes.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.570
Yeah,but that's
different. That-That'S...

02:14.570 --> 02:16.660
Okay.

02:16.780 --> 02:19.730
I guess you'll just have to inspire me.

02:26.810 --> 02:29.410
Why are you so quiet?

02:29.630 --> 02:36.310
Well,because I'm about to go to a crazy walker wedding
madhouse,so I'm enjoying the silence while I can.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.670
Oh,it'll go off without a hitch.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.340
You haven't been to one of
my family events,have you?

02:41.420 --> 02:46.430
At the walker landing opening,my mom and holly
literally pummeled each other with leftovers.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.660
Are you serious?

02:47.760 --> 02:49.610
I mean,could I make that up?

02:50.020 --> 02:53.290
The only one that wod ever
keep us in line was my dad.

02:54.020 --> 02:57.020
He even kept me sober
at tommy's wedding.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.470
Why am I even talking about him?

03:03.500 --> 03:07.010
Because weddings make you think
about the people that you miss.

03:08.460 --> 03:11.260
Yeah,but he cheated on
my mom,and he lied to us.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.000
I mean,you know,what-
Wh kind of man does that?

03:15.080 --> 03:18.280
All types,even some good guys.

03:20.540 --> 03:24.670
You know,last time I saw
him alive,uh,I was high.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.040
That sucks.

03:29.450 --> 03:32.490
Justin,I'm sure your dad loved you.

03:33.080 --> 03:39.030
And I know how awful it is,you know,being stuck
trying to make sense of it all on your own.

03:39.330 --> 03:42.130
Was that what it was
like with the married guy?

03:42.750 --> 03:46.760
Well,not that it compares
or anything,but yeah.

03:46.840 --> 03:51.740
I mean,he pretty much just said that
that was it,and,you know,that was it.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.400
Do you want to come
to the wedding with me?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.450
To tell you the truth,I never
thought this was gonna happen.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.580
I know. I always thought it'd be me and kitty
in the old folks home,sniping at each other

04:05.640 --> 04:08.040
And talking about how we
screwed up all our relationships.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.060
Well,too bad for you. And
you owe me 100 bucks.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.480
Not until she pulls the
trigger,meaning I do.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.230
Wait a minute. Are you telling me that you
bet on whether kitty would get married?

04:17.290 --> 04:18.430
And when.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.769
I took between 30 and 40.Kev bet never.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.960
Oh,come on. I can't believe
how cynical you are.

04:25.060 --> 04:29.490
Listen,I ver your debt,you pick
your grandmother up at the airport.

04:29.550 --> 04:32.810
Even if you added a couple
of zeroes,I'd still say no.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.190
It's your grandmother!

04:34.230 --> 04:35.940
I know!

04:37.080 --> 04:40.050
So,tommy,tell me,how are
you and julia getting along?

04:40.110 --> 04:42.930
Good. I mean,you know,working on it.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.510
All right,I got the monkey suits.

04:44.570 --> 04:45.720
What took you so long?

04:45.780 --> 04:47.330
I had to go to the bank.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.560
I have your $100.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.890
Pay up.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.950
What age did you pick,justin?

04:53.010 --> 04:54.170
50 or older.

04:54.230 --> 04:57.670
Oh,you know what?The shirts and
ties are still in the,uh,car.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.870
Oh,you know what?I'm,uh,I'm
bringing lena to the wedding.

04:59.930 --> 05:02.030
I hope that's not a problem
with the whole R.S.V.P.Thing.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.120
You're taking lena to the wedding?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.020
Is there a problem?

05:07.880 --> 05:09.340
No,it's fine.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.590
So what's with the look?

05:10.670 --> 05:13.800
Just not sure how seriously you're
taking your sobriety,that's all.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.840
I'm going to meetings every
day. I'd say that's pretty serious.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.170
Well,I hear her on the
phone,justin. She's a partier.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.480
Thanks for the concern,bro.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.080
I'm going with him.

05:25.670 --> 05:26.790
What are you doing?

05:26.850 --> 05:28.350
What am i doing?

05:28.430 --> 05:29.470
What is she doing?

05:29.530 --> 05:30.720
Who knows?Who cares?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.710
The only people who know you
slept with her are me and saul.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.010
Don't start acting weird now.

05:36.230 --> 05:38.000
Okay?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.310
Not yet,still
steadfast,still unchangeable,

05:44.390 --> 05:48.670
Pillow'd upon my fair love's
ripening breast,to feel for ever

05:48.750 --> 05:50.350
Its soft fall and swell.

05:50.430 --> 05:54.320
Sarah,I don't want the guests thinking
about my boobs and their ripeness,

05:54.400 --> 06:00.070
And-And plus,not to mention,robert would rather me quote
from "the weekly standard" than-Than-Than what is that,keats?

06:00.150 --> 06:01.190
I love keats.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.930
Okay,what about this?

06:03.720 --> 06:05.780
Our love...

06:05.860 --> 06:10.320
Is like the war- Out of
control,endless,without reason.

06:10.390 --> 06:13.630
You know what,sarah?This is
not the time for funny,okay?

06:13.710 --> 06:15.320
How about this?

06:15.400 --> 06:23.290
"Robert,I promise you my deepest loyalty,my
tenderest care and my lifelong fidelity.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.070
Sounds nothing like you.

06:25.150 --> 06:28.460
Well,it's not. I found it online. I
just put in the "robert" part.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.830
So has mom had the talk with you?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.370
What talk?

06:32.450 --> 06:33.630
The talk.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.750
Oh,trust me. She's gonna sit you down

06:35.810 --> 06:41.740
And go on and on and on about love
and devotion until you're both weepG.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.260
You might get some
inspiration from that.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.570
Okay,so,um,the seating
arrangements are set.

06:46.650 --> 06:48.870
The flowers,caterers,officiant
are confirmed.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.670
The secret service has already
coordinated with private security,

06:51.760 --> 06:54.130
So I-I don't think there's
anything major left.

06:54.230 --> 06:58.040
Except robert just asked
kitty to write her vows.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.390
Okay,how about this?

07:00.470 --> 07:04.250
Robert,I hate your guts
for making me do this.

07:05.610 --> 07:08.570
It's your hairdresser. Did you
make a decision,up or down?

07:08.650 --> 07:11.550
Uh,I-I don't know. You know
what?You-You guys pick.

07:11.585 --> 07:13.480
- I say down.
- Down.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.770
Up!Up.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.630
Uh,we're going with up.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.590
Oh,wow. Mom,thank you. Those look
great. Thank you for doing that.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.240
Where are all
the,uh,the-The poetry books?

07:29.320 --> 07:32.450
Um,they're the third
shelf up from the bottom.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.890
Kitty?

07:33.950 --> 07:36.230
Can I talk to you?

07:42.310 --> 07:43.260
What's up?

07:43.340 --> 07:45.520
Oh,sweetie,here u go.

07:45.970 --> 07:50.370
I know how easy it is with weddings,to
get swept up with the tradition

07:50.460 --> 07:52.630
And the dress and the
music and the rice and-

07:52.740 --> 07:56.070
- Well,birdseed.
- Birdseed?Go on.

07:56.150 --> 08:00.980
Tomorrow you're gonna put that beautiful
dress on and walk down the aisle to robert,

08:01.060 --> 08:06.470
Who is so handsome and powerful-
My god,he could be president one day

08:06.740 --> 08:10.470
- And you're going to commit the rest of your life to him.

08:11.390 --> 08:17.450
And before you know it,you will have completely
forgotten who you are and what you stand for.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.480
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm
sorry. What did you say?

08:20.540 --> 08:22.620
Maybe I didn't say that
right. Sweetie,listen.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.530
Marriage is not easy.

08:24.590 --> 08:27.590
And then you'll have kids
and lose yourself completely.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.470
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute,mom.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.419
Sarah told me that you were gonna give
me a gushy speech that would make me cry,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.460
And wh-Wh-What is
this that I'm getting?

08:34.500 --> 08:38.450
Maybe back then I was giving the
warm and wonderful marriage speech.

08:38.510 --> 08:41.809
I am wiser now,and I have some things
to say to you. I'm not gonna lie.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.090
Please lie. Please lie. I
would prefer you to lie.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.980
- I nt you to protect the woman that you are,kitty.
- What?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.970
I've seen you struggle with
robert's career and his ambition.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.470
I don't want you to
let him hold you back!

08:52.530 --> 08:53.440
No,I can't hear you.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.740
Kitty,kitty,stop acting like a child.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.920
Well,start acting like my mother.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.760
Mom,I am getting married tomorrow.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.790
I am-I am
really,really nervous.

09:01.850 --> 09:04.930
I have to write my vows,and I
don't need you to give me cold feet.

09:04.990 --> 09:06.880
I have some things I want to say to you.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.070
I know,but
shh!I need-

09:08.110 --> 09:10.410
Silence is golden.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.970
I- I-I-
Shh,shh,shh!

09:21.150 --> 09:23.360
I didn't say that right.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.500
Hey,isaac. What,calling
to congratulate me?

09:26.560 --> 09:30.570
Congratulations,but I'm calling
about robert's service in the gulf.

09:30.670 --> 09:34.750
Any discrepancies regarding
his alleged heroic acts?

09:34.790 --> 09:35.990
Alleged?

09:36.050 --> 09:39.870
I've been hearing rumors,uh,from folks
in a position to publish those rumors.

09:39.930 --> 09:40.980
No,no,no. Wait a minute.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.810
That issue,I thought I shut it down.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.740
I mean,I handled it personally.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.250
Robert had no idea.

09:46.330 --> 09:48.070
Oh,isaac.

09:48.130 --> 09:52.780
Isaac,something- Something like that could sabotage
his- His whole run,not to mention my marriage. I-I-

09:52.840 --> 09:54.800
I'm on my way to L.A.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.160
Consider it my wedding gift.

So you must be happy with
all the photographers outside.

10:08.090 --> 10:11.070
Are you kidding me?You can't
pay for that kind of publicity.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.810
So,um,you guys back together?

10:13.880 --> 10:18.790
You know,we're-We're just in the
process of,you know,becoming a "we"...

10:18.830 --> 10:22.230
Depending on what your
definition of "we" is.

10:23.210 --> 10:25.060
- He's such a romantic.
- It's not that.

10:25.130 --> 10:27.230
I knew I'd find you guys by the wine.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.670
So this is the famous lena.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.770
I mean,uh,justin talks
about you all the time.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.560
You do?

10:35.640 --> 10:37.430
Yeah,of course I do.

10:37.530 --> 10:38.940
Of course.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.360
Look at you.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.530
Lena,hi.

10:44.590 --> 10:46.100
Tommy's not making you work,is he?

10:46.160 --> 10:48.980
Oh,no,no. She's,uh,she's with me.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.210
H's kitty?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.050
Well,she's finally
getting her hair done,

10:53.110 --> 10:55.860
But now she's obsessed with us
finding some old friend of hers-Isaac.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.260
She's kinda freakin' out.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.740
You're so not seeing that 100.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.380
Oh,please. Maybe mom could chill her out.

11:00.440 --> 11:05.210
No. Kitty ordered us not to let your mom within 50 feet
of her until right before they walk down the aisle.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.510
Good luck with that.

11:06.570 --> 11:08.990
All right,I should probably
keep looking for this isaac guy.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.540
- See you.
- Good luck.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.020
Here's to not being a bridesmaid.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.920
Cin cin.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.790
Kitty,hey,sorry.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.280
Um,where's the hairstylist?

11:21.340 --> 11:25.920
Oh,um,you know,she- She was
chatty and annoying and distracting,

11:25.980 --> 11:28.320
And you know what?I've-I've
mastered pin curls.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.550
Oh,good. Um,okay.

11:29.610 --> 11:31.470
Well,shouldn't the makeup
artist at least be here?

11:31.530 --> 11:33.380
Oh,yeah,well,he came
by,but you know what?

11:33.430 --> 11:37.570
I've been doing my makeup since puberty,and-And
outside of the purple eye shadow phase,I-I do fine.

11:37.630 --> 11:41.340
Oh,great. Well-Well,I'm sure you'll look
stunning. But how are you doing on the vows?

11:41.380 --> 11:43.300
- Are they coming along?
- I'm-I'm winging it.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.850
You know what?Robert
said they came to him,

11:44.910 --> 11:47.560
So they're-They're-They're
gonna come to me eventually.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.230
Okay,um

11:50.810 --> 11:53.060
- Isaac,isaac!Oh,you're here!

11:53.160 --> 11:54.110
Hi,I'm sorry.

11:54.190 --> 11:55.340
My plane got detoured.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.710
Snowstorms in the midwest.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.010
Whatever. You're here. Thank you.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.070
I'm so-I'm so happy. Do-Do
you mind if we take a minute?

12:01.150 --> 12:02.530
Uh,yes.

12:03.540 --> 12:06.950
Uh,uh,kitty I have to tell you,though,um,you
know,you're- You're running out of- Time.

12:07.010 --> 12:08.400
Time. I'll-I'll
be ready.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.370
Tell everybody that I'll be ready.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.490
How bad is it?

12:16.550 --> 12:18.430
You could use some lipstick.

12:22.220 --> 12:25.160
All right. Why don't- Why don't you
talk while I- While I get ready?

12:27.170 --> 12:29.000
You want to get that?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.250
Oh,god,no.

12:31.330 --> 12:33.660
Kitty,I know you're angry at me. Please.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.090
We have to talk before
you walk down the aisle.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.420
Oh,darn it.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.420
I still can't believe we're at
some big shot republican's wedding.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.020
Man!Times change.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.230
Stan,now this is my daughter's
wedding. There'll be no politics today.

12:46.290 --> 12:47.920
Sure. -Okay.

12:47.980 --> 12:51.650
I bet you could feed a small african
country for what this shindig cost.

12:51.710 --> 12:52.810
Nora.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.430
Saul,where's mother?

12:54.510 --> 12:56.790
She's stuck in denver
because of the snow.

12:56.850 --> 12:58.500
No ida?That's a shame.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.820
Not really. Stan,it's saul.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.620
Oh,saul,how are you?
- Yeah,good to see you.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.010
Why don't you two catch
up?I've gotta find kitty.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.830
Stan the hippie.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.440
Oh,well,that's a long time ago.

13:10.500 --> 13:15.910
So the copilot wanted robert to land the chopper,and
robert thought it was too dangerous to go down.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.410
How long did they argue?

13:17.480 --> 13:19.090
Well,about 25 seconds.

13:19.150 --> 13:22.050
For 25 seconds they hovered under fire?

13:22.090 --> 13:23.430
And then they were hit.

13:23.490 --> 13:24.950
Copilot died in the crash landing.

13:25.030 --> 13:28.130
But once robert was on the
ground,he saved those men.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.270
Okaylf it was
up to him-.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.830
Yeah,they would've left.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.970
That's why daniel cole
came out of the woodwork.

13:34.050 --> 13:35.830
He said that he heard the whole
thing from the control tower

13:35.890 --> 13:39.520
And that he could prove that robert wasn't
the hero that everybody thinks he is.

13:39.780 --> 13:42.190
So you and kevin blackmailed him.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.380
Yes,we blackmailed him.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.000
I would have done the same thing.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.070
You missed one.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.590
Thank you.

13:53.650 --> 13:55.260
What do you think?Is
there any way to spin it?

13:55.320 --> 13:56.910
Better to find the leak.

13:56.990 --> 13:59.720
If it turns out to be
cole,shut him down again.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.760
I'll make some calls,see what I can do.

14:01.850 --> 14:04.780
Oh,god,isaac. You know that robert
doesn't know anything about this?

14:04.860 --> 14:08.590
Now how am I supposed to go down the
aisle,look him in the eye and vow to do

14:08.650 --> 14:12.290
- I don't- I don't even
know what I'm vowing. I...

14:12.490 --> 14:14.210
Kitty walker,open this door!

14:14.310 --> 14:16.530
Hey,you get married. Leave this to me.

14:16.590 --> 14:17.810
All right. Thanks. Thanks.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.920
I'm serious. I will kick it down!

14:20.350 --> 14:22.350
No sense in ruining your shoes.

14:22.390 --> 14:23.920
I'm sorry.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.030
Lena.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.810
Is everything okay?

14:27.890 --> 14:28.920
Yeah,I'm fine.

14:28.980 --> 14:30.480
Are you sure?Where's justin?

14:30.540 --> 14:31.910
Something happen?

14:31.970 --> 14:34.210
No,not really. It's just...

14:34.270 --> 14:37.460
St so strange seeing tommy here...

14:37.500 --> 14:42.380
And all the high-Powered guests and the
secret service agents just everywhere.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.480
Wh-What would be weird
about seeing tommy?

14:44.540 --> 14:45.760
Oh,nothing.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.440
I- I just work for him.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.220
So it's weird.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.710
Lena,please tell me that
tommy isn't the married man.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.760
Oh,my god. Are you kidding?

14:56.840 --> 14:59.710
Like,what are you
doing?So justin is just...

15:00.590 --> 15:02.270
Sarah wants us,now.

15:02.340 --> 15:03.460
Okay,um...

15:03.940 --> 15:05.540
Oh,my god.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.650
Oh,no. Not this putz.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.490
Hey,everyone,uncle jack.

15:14.570 --> 15:17.270
I can call you that,right,now
that we're almost family?

15:17.390 --> 15:19.240
Uh,I don't think so.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.450
Uh,no.

15:20.510 --> 15:23.920
Come on,troops,let's
go find,uh,our spots.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.600
Let's go find our places.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.510
Come on,kids.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.180
That was unpleasant.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.310
So just,uh...

15:33.370 --> 15:35.380
Just be good to kitty.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.070
Better than you were to my brother?

15:39.270 --> 15:40.760
That's unfair.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.860
He is half a world away trying to
make a difference with his life.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.760
He is all alone,and you du him.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.680
Now it's none of my business,so
I'm just gonna get through this.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.890
I'm gonna be cordial,and that's
what we should do for kitty's sake.

15:54.970 --> 15:56.850
Of course.

16:05.430 --> 16:08.740
My tie is itch you can take
it off after the ceremony,okay?

16:09.330 --> 16:11.400
Oh,my god. Oh,my god,kitty.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.220
Aunt kitty,you look so beautiful.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.830
Oh,honey,so do you.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.240
You guys look great.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.560
Okay,now f you go with your
aunties and get to your places.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.080
- Oh,god,what do you think?Do you think my hair's too curly?
- No.

16:27.170 --> 16:30.510
Should I wear it down? -It's
beautiful. It suits the dress perfectly.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.790
Okay. Turn around.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.530
What is it,kitty?Are you okay?

16:39.800 --> 16:42.380
Just wishing dad was here.

16:42.930 --> 16:45.480
Oh,I know.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.190
It's not fair,is it?

16:49.210 --> 16:53.660
Oh,god. I can't believe my baby
sister is finally getting married.

16:53.750 --> 16:54.800
I can't believe it either.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.810
I really-I get- You
know,I-I never wrote my vows.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.060
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.790
You'll just stand up
there and be honest.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.410
Okay?You're gonna be great. I promise.

17:03.970 --> 17:06.050
- Flowers.
- Thanks.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.970
I'm gonna tell them we're ready.

17:27.450 --> 17:30.820
Isn't she ready yet?It's
time. -Oh,here she is.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.380
Oh,kitty,you look so wonderful.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.980
All right,they start with you,sweetie.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.680
Kitty,please,please,let me talk to you.

17:36.740 --> 17:37.960
Mom,mom,mom,we'll talk later.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.710
Look,I-You didn't let me finish
what I was saying the other day...

17:40.800 --> 17:43.290
Okay,the music's starting.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.050
Okay,julia,go.

17:55.110 --> 17:57.650
And I can't let you get married-
Becca,you're up. You're up.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.000
Mom,we'll talk later. It's
not a good time.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.320
I can't let you get married
until you hear what I have to say.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.960
Sarah,go. You're up. -Go,sarah,go.

18:09.050 --> 18:13.090
- Look,kitty,I know what I'm gonna say. I'll talk fast.
- Okay,mom. Come on,we have to go.

18:31.620 --> 18:36.720
You have been my child,my
challenge,my support,my best friend.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.460
Mom... you're gonna make me cry.

18:38.540 --> 18:42.310
Well,maybe you should cry- Or laugh
or do whatever your heart tells you to.

18:42.390 --> 18:47.900
I know how hard you've worked to find someone to
love who would really see you and love you back.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.400
Kitty,you're incapable
of losing yourself.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.550
You're not me.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.370
You know yourself
better than I ever have.

18:54.450 --> 18:57.510
And I'm so proud to be your mother.

18:58.890 --> 19:00.520
Is everything okay?

19:00.660 --> 19:02.250
Yeah.

19:08.350 --> 19:14.890
We're gathered here to join robert alexander
mccallister and katherine ann walker in matrimony.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.040
Who gives this woman to be married?

19:17.120 --> 19:21.120
She gives herself freely,with
my love and my blessing.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.420
Mom?

19:38.540 --> 19:40.530
You can let go now.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.630
Oh,yeah,sorry.

19:44.020 --> 19:46.350
Where's stan? -I don't know.

19:52.270 --> 19:56.320
Robert and kitty initially
chose to recite traditional vows.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.380
But anyone that knows this couple
knows they are not traditional.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.300
So I wasn't surprised when
they opted to write their own.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.260
Kitty?

20:09.220 --> 20:11.040
No. Do-Uh...

20:11.100 --> 20:13.500
Do you think maybe
that you could go first?

20:14.550 --> 20:16.560
Of course.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.210
KittY...

20:18.270 --> 20:20.130
I ask you to marry me.

20:21.180 --> 20:26.930
To say "I love you" seems inadequate,because
I cannot imagine my life without you.

20:26.990 --> 20:31.070
Because when I'm
cynical,you give me hope.

20:32.340 --> 20:35.290
In times where I felt
I was losing my way,

20:35.350 --> 20:38.030
You've been my guidepost.

20:38.110 --> 20:40.560
I love you more with each passing day.

20:40.860 --> 20:49.090
And so I give you my
hand,my heart and my love.

20:49.170 --> 20:51.240
Xxxxxxxxx

20:51.300 --> 20:53.710
Kitty,your turn.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.740
Robert,I need to talk to you.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.710
What?

21:01.790 --> 21:02.630
Alone.

21:02.670 --> 21:03.600
Right now? -Right now.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.110
I need to talk to you alone.

21:05.190 --> 21:07.860
I'm-I'm
sorry. I'm-I'm sorry.

21:12.110 --> 21:13.710
We'll be right back.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.230
I d't know.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.770
Here.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.570
Thank you.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.870
Kitty...

21:25.210 --> 21:26.070
What is going on?

21:26.130 --> 21:30.340
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,robert,but I
ju-I just couldn't go through with it.

21:30.420 --> 21:35.250
I couldn't vow to love you and-And
honor you and all that stuff without...

21:35.330 --> 21:36.650
Without telling you the truth.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.790
Kitty,what are you talking about?

21:40.780 --> 21:43.080
I blackmailed someone.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.330
First the brother dumps
jason,and now this.

21:47.410 --> 21:48.780
We don't deserve this.

21:48.860 --> 21:51.180
What did we ever do to this family?

21:51.250 --> 21:53.580
We need drinks out there immediately.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.770
Uh,we weren't prepared to
serve at the wedding itself.

21:55.850 --> 21:57.830
Well,improvise.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.840
Maybe she finally came to her senses.

21:59.910 --> 22:00.990
Kevin.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.290
You know kitty. Maybe she,uh...

22:04.680 --> 22:05.750
Got nothing.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.470
If this has anything to do with
what I said to her yesterday

22:08.540 --> 22:10.390
- Why didn't I just keep my big mouth closed?

22:10.450 --> 22:14.100
Come on,mother. She doesn't pay
attention to anything we say anyway.

22:14.180 --> 22:16.440
But if I had anything to do with this...

22:16.500 --> 22:21.080
Look,whatever is happening between kitty and
robert,we just have to let them figure it out.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.380
Let's get another.

22:22.730 --> 22:23.670
Waiter?

22:23.730 --> 22:25.290
I don't understand the issue.

22:25.380 --> 22:26.510
You were doing your job.

22:26.570 --> 22:29.260
Kevin and I should have
told you what we did,but I...

22:29.320 --> 22:30.840
I guess I just wanted to protect you.

22:30.920 --> 22:34.760
But I just couldn't marry you
with this big secret. It just-

22:34.840 --> 22:38.240
Kitty,I know that there are
no guarantees in this world.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.470
We could wake up tomorrow,and
could all go to hell.

22:40.530 --> 22:45.090
But whatever happens,good
or bad,I want you with me.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.340
Okay?

22:48.110 --> 22:49.590
Okay.

22:49.670 --> 22:50.740
Come on.

22:50.820 --> 22:51.770
Let's go do this.

22:51.830 --> 22:57.610
Robert,I-I don't even kn where to
start,because you are so many things to me.

22:57.670 --> 23:02.970
You're this-This
brilliant,poised diplomat...

23:03.330 --> 23:08.910
And then you're this-This really crazy
romantic that just takes my breath away.

23:08.990 --> 23:13.560
And when you're tired,and when
you're stressed,you-You get really...

23:13.680 --> 23:15.650
Grumpy.

23:16.400 --> 23:21.900
But then I can feel your head
on my shoulder at night,and I...

23:21.960 --> 23:24.390
And I know you're asleep.

23:24.470 --> 23:27.290
And you're so peaceful,and you're so...

23:27.350 --> 23:29.760
You're so vulnerable.

23:31.090 --> 23:37.520
I love all those parts so much that I want to
have you as my partner for the rest of my life.

23:37.580 --> 23:42.200
Sick,healthy,rich,poor-
As long as I'm with you,I...

23:42.280 --> 23:44.900
I will be complete.

23:46.370 --> 23:48.510
And that's it.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.310
Oh,um,one more thing,robert.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.920
Will you be my husband?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.440
Yes.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.630
Yes,I'll be your husband.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.340
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

24:14.060 --> 24:16.100
Robert...

24:16.470 --> 24:19.800
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my love.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.910
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

24:59.660 --> 25:03.090
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

25:03.170 --> 25:08.060
The good thing for us is that cole is not giving
any details until he's offered some serious cash.

25:08.130 --> 25:11.980
Excuse me. Would anyone mind explaining to
me why I'm just learning about this now?

25:12.070 --> 25:13.630
I learned about it during my vows.

25:13.680 --> 25:18.040
Isaac,there is no legitimate media source that is
gonna go public with this story on his word alone.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.240
They have to have
substantiated proof,right?

25:20.300 --> 25:21.600
Well,he claims he has it.

25:21.680 --> 25:26.960
He says that he has copies of the flight traffic
reports and the communication logs from that day.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.360
Yeah,but why now?

25:28.440 --> 25:29.820
Is he waiting for the
worst possible moment?

25:29.880 --> 25:31.420
Well,I don't know. Maybe he's bluffing.

25:31.490 --> 25:36.560
Either way,the next move is we go
to the news outlets with the truth.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.700
The truth?

25:37.760 --> 25:39.690
Well,our opponents are gonna
have a field day with that.

25:39.750 --> 25:40.790
You know what they're gonna do?

25:40.850 --> 25:42.070
They're gonna swift boat him.

25:42.150 --> 25:43.830
No,the truth
about cole-

25:43.890 --> 25:47.120
That he's a perjurer,a blackmailer,a
felon and a deadbeat dad,

25:47.180 --> 25:50.540
And anybody who goes with the story is gonna
be dragged up to the hill for a hearing,period.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.630
Exactly.

25:51.710 --> 25:52.960
All right.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.610
Let's do it.

25:55.310 --> 25:56.830
Isaac,thank you.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.040
Kitty and I should spend
some time with the guests.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.380
This fish is undercooked.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.300
It's tuna tartare. It's raw.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.810
Thanks for telling me.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.350
Any chance I can take another picture?

26:14.410 --> 26:16.020
No,you only get one.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.110
I can't believe the entire mccallister
clan are giving me the cold shoulder.

26:20.150 --> 26:22.390
I mean,what did jason tell them?

26:22.470 --> 26:24.120
No idea.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.100
Oh,god,look what your
mom's date wrote-

26:26.160 --> 26:29.670
"Stop the erosion of civil
rights. Peace and love. Stan.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.480
" You know,I'm done
justifying this breakup.

26:31.540 --> 26:32.490
Then don'T.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.880
Well-Well,why am i
the bad guy,you know?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.320
I didn't set out to hurt jason.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.740
What-And,you know,I'm not
the only one to blame here.

26:37.820 --> 26:39.620
In fact,he's-
Okay,done. Stop.

26:39.680 --> 26:43.230
I'm not here as a friend to listen to you
endlessly go on about your ex-Boyfriend,

26:43.310 --> 26:46.810
Because however you define what
we are,we're not platonic anymore,

26:46.890 --> 26:49.840
And that fact that you're
willing to obsess over jason-

26:49.900 --> 26:52.750
I'm not obsessed. I'm
sorry. I'm really sorry.

26:52.860 --> 26:54.640
I'm gonna take a walk.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.680
Thank you.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.100
Have you seen any nice
men in my age range?

27:04.180 --> 27:06.250
Some of the secret service guys are hot.

27:06.310 --> 27:08.900
Yeah,yeah,they're
hot,but they're so cold.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.450
Well,I have driven another man away.

27:12.510 --> 27:15.550
I'd love to commiserate,but cooper's
throwing hors d'oeuvres in the pool.

27:15.650 --> 27:17.320
Cooper!

27:19.560 --> 27:21.930
You look about as happy
as I do,which is not.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.350
You know how you guys tell each other
everything in this family,even if you shouldn't?

27:26.430 --> 27:28.660
Our family's curse and
blessing. What about it?

27:30.570 --> 27:35.320
Is there anything that you won't tell each
other,that's just completely off-Limits?

27:35.380 --> 27:39.290
I... probably wouldn't tell kitty
I'd like to murder her husband.

27:39.350 --> 27:44.000
And it wouldn't be that difficult getting my
hands on a shotgun,thanks to him and his ilk.

27:47.350 --> 27:48.780
Thanks,kevin.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.250
You're welcome.

27:51.110 --> 27:52.600
For what,I have no idea.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.050
Champagne,please.

27:55.110 --> 27:56.470
Excuse me.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.180
Would you come with us,please?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.260
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

28:01.790 --> 28:04.630
Hey,um,do you think we
could go somewhere to talk?

28:04.710 --> 28:06.320
Is everything all right?

28:06.430 --> 28:08.070
No,not really.

28:11.030 --> 28:12.530
Nora?

28:13.070 --> 28:14.150
Isaac marshall.

28:14.210 --> 28:15.470
Yes,of course.

28:15.540 --> 28:18.170
And may I say,you look
as beautiful as the bride.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.500
Well,thank you.

28:19.580 --> 28:20.520
How are you?

28:20.580 --> 28:22.730
Not bad. And you?

28:22.780 --> 28:26.330
I'm fine,but I seem
to have lost my date.

28:26.430 --> 28:28.070
I wonder where holly harper is?

28:28.150 --> 28:31.260
In that case,would you like to
have a glass of champagne with me?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.930
Well,I'd love to. Thank you.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.150
So what was so important it can't wait?

28:37.210 --> 28:38.740
I can't believe you would do this.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.590
Do what?

28:40.990 --> 28:43.620
You slept with lena,tommy. I know.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.030
Look,it was stupid.

28:46.090 --> 28:47.330
Don't you think I realize that?

28:47.390 --> 28:48.690
Oh,you do?So what,you're
off the hook now?

28:48.770 --> 28:51.040
You of all people
shouldn't judge,really.

28:51.110 --> 28:53.360
WowYou are seriously an ass.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.650
You're cheating on your wife,and
your baby's,what,6 months old?

28:55.710 --> 28:57.580
And-And somehow you
manage to be self-Righteous?

28:57.660 --> 28:58.820
It was a mistake.

28:58.855 --> 28:59.945
God. You know what?

28:59.980 --> 29:01.680
You're always trying to be
like dad. But you know what?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.800
Even he had enough sense
not to screw his secretary!

29:03.860 --> 29:05.570
Will you just shut
up and let me explain?

29:05.650 --> 29:06.720
You want to explain something?

29:06.780 --> 29:10.220
How about you explain to your wife that
you cheated on her the second she left town?

29:10.260 --> 29:11.480
This is none of your business,all
right? -Get off me,tommy!

29:11.560 --> 29:13.290
This is none of your
business! -Get off me!

29:13.370 --> 29:15.490
Gentlemen?

29:17.700 --> 29:19.080
Yo,this is ridiculous.

29:19.170 --> 29:21.210
Like,we're-We're
brothers. We weren't fighting.

29:21.270 --> 29:22.560
We'll talk to the senator.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.630
I own this place,all right?

29:23.710 --> 29:25.970
You cannot keep me
here- Save your breath.

29:26.050 --> 29:29.700
Apparently,the feds can
detain us indefinitely.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.660
Thank you,neocons.

29:31.740 --> 29:33.000
Why are you two here?

29:33.090 --> 29:36.530
Oh,'cause justin's apparently the
self-Appointed judge of the family.

29:36.590 --> 29:38.510
You know what?And tommy's a
hypocrite and liar,so don'T.

29:38.590 --> 29:40.190
Oh,you found out about lena?

29:40.250 --> 29:42.120
Wait a second. You know about
lena?How do you kw about lena?

29:42.180 --> 29:43.840
If it's any consolation,I
wish i didn't know.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.440
I wish so many things right now.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.950
So,uh,what did you do?

29:48.020 --> 29:49.740
Assassination threat on mccallister.

29:49.840 --> 29:50.825
What?

29:50.860 --> 29:52.650
I didn't mean it. I was just being me.

29:52.730 --> 29:54.420
You know what?I hate my life right now.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.910
Wow,this is the worst
wedding in history.

29:56.970 --> 30:00.240
You didn't happen to bring any of
those,um,appetizers with you,did you?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.470
Yeah,I've got a shrimp
cocktail in my pocket.

30:02.570 --> 30:03.730
What is wrong with you?

30:03.810 --> 30:05.150
He's got the munchies.

30:05.230 --> 30:06.880
Oh,great.

30:13.690 --> 30:15.930
Aren't you glad that
I took dance lessons?

30:16.010 --> 30:17.500
My feet thank you.

30:18.190 --> 30:22.050
Do you realize that this is the first
time that we've had a moment alone

30:22.130 --> 30:23.830
- Uh,we have a little situation.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.360
What?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.330
You haven't seen justin,have you?

30:29.390 --> 30:30.820
No.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.030
And you should know that I
told justin about you and tommy.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.150
What?

30:36.210 --> 30:39.980
I'm sorry,but justin's been through
enough. He doesn't deserve to get hurt.

30:40.060 --> 30:43.730
You know what?In case you've forgotten,you
used to sleep with a married guy,too.

30:43.790 --> 30:47.710
But what,now since you've hit the paternity
jackpot,you can act as if you're better than me?

30:47.770 --> 30:49.400
I was 16,and I screwed up.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.760
But knowing you,dating justin is just
some calculated way to get tommy back,

30:52.820 --> 30:55.150
And I'm sorry,but it is
spiteful,and it is stupid.

30:55.210 --> 30:59.280
You know what?If I didn't know that you
two were related,I'd think you were jealous.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.250
He's my brother. I'm just
trying to protect him.

31:02.310 --> 31:03.680
From what?

31:04.970 --> 31:08.560
God,why did i think that there would
be any available men at this wedding?

31:08.630 --> 31:13.210
I just had a 20-Minute conversation
about- Get it-Quail hunting.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.880
Will you tell justin that I went home?

31:15.990 --> 31:17.810
He can call me if he wants.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.800
What did I just walk into?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.770
Nothing. I'm sorry.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.490
Ah,thank you.

31:28.590 --> 31:29.870
You look lonely.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.450
I am lonely.

31:31.730 --> 31:33.410
Look at all these couples.

31:34.050 --> 31:38.980
I don't care how old you are,it
is tough being single at a wedding.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.060
Right.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.410
You can't help but think about
all the chances that you missed

31:43.490 --> 31:47.430
Or what it would have been
like to have found that person.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.720
Do you ever think maybe
we ended things too soon?

31:53.650 --> 31:55.650
I like you,saul.

31:55.710 --> 31:58.950
But one thing I know is men.

31:59.430 --> 32:03.560
And when we were together,I knew that
you weren't that interested in me.

32:03.830 --> 32:05.560
Oh,you tried...

32:05.930 --> 32:08.320
Eh,I guess you're right.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.170
It is my fault.

32:10.230 --> 32:12.650
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

32:13.070 --> 32:17.280
It is not easy finding the
right person the right time.

32:18.200 --> 32:23.150
I was in love with a
man I could never have.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.890
I didn't mean to be. I just was.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.470
You can't help who you love,saul.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.020
Cheers,holly.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.350
Cheers.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.130
Brothers-In-Law...

32:40.150 --> 32:41.830
Stan.

32:41.910 --> 32:43.890
All right,let these guys out.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Yes,free us,please.

32:46.260 --> 32:48.630
Any chance I can get my pipe back?

32:48.710 --> 32:51.270
The uniformed officer in the
hallway is holding your pipe.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.980
Thank you,mr. America.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.340
So is,uh,kitty gonna disown us or what?

32:55.400 --> 32:56.830
No,she doesn't know anything about thiS.

32:56.910 --> 32:59.410
I think we should
probably keep it that way.

32:59.870 --> 33:01.210
All right. Thanks.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.690
You know,I was surprised to hear that
you went out on a limb for my campaign.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.760
Kitty told me what you did last
year to help with daniel cole.

33:09.890 --> 33:11.900
Yeah,well,I actually did that for kitty.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.560
But just so that you know,

33:13.620 --> 33:18.010
I care a lot about jason,and if things
had worked out differently between us...

33:18.080 --> 33:21.630
Actually,we still wouldn't have been
able to get married in this country.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.770
You're not ever gonna stop
holding that against me,are you?

33:24.830 --> 33:27.360
No,but I will stop
threatening your life.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.240
Sounds like we're making some progress.

33:30.940 --> 33:35.290
My oldest-Paul-Um,he married
a woman from a hindu family.

33:35.410 --> 33:36.570
Paul is your oldest?

33:36.650 --> 33:37.800
How many children do you have?

33:37.880 --> 33:38.810
Can't believe I gotta pay a fine.

33:38.870 --> 33:39.780
Stan,where have you been?

33:39.870 --> 33:41.470
I've been looking all
over for-Oh,sorry.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.680
Stan,isaac. Isaac,stan.

33:43.770 --> 33:44.810
Hi,isaac. How's it going?

33:44.850 --> 33:46.220
What fine do you have to pay?

33:46.290 --> 33:49.800
All I did was smoke a bowl,and
suddenly it's- It's like freakin' waco!

33:49.880 --> 33:51.850
You were smoking pot at
my daughter's wedding?

33:51.910 --> 33:53.010
Just to unwind.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.090
Are you out of your mind?

33:54.170 --> 33:55.400
Robert's running for president.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.730
The media is right outside.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.230
What were you thinking?

33:59.620 --> 34:01.170
Okay.

34:01.230 --> 34:03.550
Nora,I'm going home.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.580
Stan,you're not leaving?

34:05.690 --> 34:08.540
Look,uh,I appreciate you looking me up.

34:08.639 --> 34:12.110
It was really amazing seeing you again.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.980
But,uh,it's just not gonna work.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.870
I'm-I'm
sorry.

34:19.830 --> 34:23.650
Did I just get dumped at my
daughter's wedding reception?

34:24.790 --> 34:26.710
Seems to me like you did.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.860
Excuse me.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.260
Thanks.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.820
So what was travis on about?

34:36.300 --> 34:37.530
Yeah,it was nothing.

34:37.590 --> 34:40.880
Good,'cause I think I would crumble into a
million little pieces if there was another crisis.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.030
No,you wouldn'T.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.699
You think you would,but you wouldn'T.

34:44.090 --> 34:45.719
I know you betteR.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.889
How do you feel about
starting the honeymoon early?

34:51.850 --> 34:53.310
But we haven't cut the cake.

34:53.389 --> 34:54.750
Don't care.

34:54.830 --> 34:56.110
You haven't thrown your bouquet.

34:56.190 --> 34:57.610
Still not caring.

34:57.690 --> 34:58.740
What about your garter?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.770
I think maybe I'll
just save that for you.

35:01.110 --> 35:02.730
Now how could i say no to that?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.890
You caT.

35:04.940 --> 35:06.420
I'll be right back.

35:07.660 --> 35:10.590
Mom?Sorry,isaac. Can I
talk to you for a second?

35:10.670 --> 35:12.580
Yes. Excuse me.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.530
Is something wrong? -No. No. No. No.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.260
Everything is perfect,but,well,

35:17.300 --> 35:19.570
Robert and i just thought
maybe we could get some time

35:19.640 --> 35:22.000
- Alone,out of the hoopla.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.910
Yeah,I'm getting a little
tired of the hoopla.

35:25.230 --> 35:26.900
Well,go.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.280
Start your honeymoon.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.210
I love you so much.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.960
I love you,too.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.220
Can you believe it?

35:37.290 --> 35:38.700
No...

35:40.630 --> 35:44.270
Well,tell everybody
I said good-Bye,and...

35:44.370 --> 35:45.940
And thanks.

36:01.050 --> 36:05.330
Oh,I can't believe I made it
through that entire wedding sober.

36:05.450 --> 36:06.580
You were in lockdown.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.120
Yeah,with stan.

36:08.350 --> 36:10.740
It was like a new,special
kind of torture.

36:11.870 --> 36:16.090
Yeah,nd of like being stuck talking
to a bunch of relatives you don't know.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.980
Yeah,I'm sorry.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.510
Look,I was-I was
the worst date today.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.490
Uh,"date" implies you
actually see the person.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.890
I know. I
just-You know,

36:25.970 --> 36:28.170
I didn't know jason's family
were gonna get to me like that.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.260
Get to you?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.660
You were making death threats.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.610
Oh,c-Yeah,come-Yeah,do
I look like an assassin?

36:33.670 --> 36:38.520
You can't get mad at me for being upset at a
bunch of people I don't even know acting like I'm

36:38.600 --> 36:40.500
- I'm the "gay guy" who doesn't know how to commit.

36:40.580 --> 36:45.090
Then why did you stand there telling everyone
we're still trying to define the word "we"?

36:46.300 --> 36:50.190
Because you said you wanted
to take things slow,scotty.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.130
You're not over him,kev.

36:54.180 --> 36:57.370
At least,that's what
it feels like to me.

36:57.450 --> 37:02.450
Okay,maybe I'm not over jason
completely,but I am getting there.

37:02.550 --> 37:05.090
Scotty,I want to be with you.

37:06.210 --> 37:08.190
Me,too.

37:08.790 --> 37:11.370
But sometimes just because
you want something...

37:12.540 --> 37:14.690
Doest mean it's possible.

37:19.180 --> 37:20.310
Two down.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.910
Thank you so much for
helping me get them home.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.400
Oh,you're welcome.

37:24.980 --> 37:25.980
Is paige asleep?

37:26.050 --> 37:28.130
Yeah,as soon as her head hit the pillow.

37:28.930 --> 37:32.010
It took some convincing to
get her to take the dress off.

37:33.870 --> 37:35.540
Oh,what a day,huh?

37:35.620 --> 37:36.950
I know.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.950
Sarah,can I ask you kind
of a random question?

37:41.010 --> 37:41.950
Sure.

37:42.050 --> 37:43.220
Can you get that?

37:45.850 --> 37:48.950
Why did you tell me the
truth about who my father is?

37:49.070 --> 37:51.010
I mean...

37:51.050 --> 37:53.120
You could have just not said anything.

37:57.580 --> 38:02.900
Well,at the time,I told myself it
was because you had a right to know.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.920
It was gonna come out anyway.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.160
But you want to know
the god's honest truth?

38:08.860 --> 38:10.930
I did it to spite your mother.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.290
I figured.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.570
I think that's why I kissed joe...

38:17.650 --> 38:19.590
To get back at you.

38:22.700 --> 38:26.290
So why are we having this
trip down bad memory lane?

38:28.170 --> 38:30.610
I'm sorry. I...

38:31.020 --> 38:35.190
Honestly,I-I told justin
something really awful about lena.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.140
What?

38:36.220 --> 38:36.970
You don't want to know.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.960
Oh,come on,I do. I do. -You
really,really don't want to know.

38:39.060 --> 38:42.290
You can't drop a big clanger like
that and then go all clammy on me.

38:42.370 --> 38:47.730
I'm your sister. Come on,I
love salacious gossip.

38:47.810 --> 38:49.310
Okay.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.940
Lena was sleeping with tommy.

38:55.510 --> 38:57.550
Our tommy?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.240
Oh,god.

39:01.320 --> 39:06.010
And you know how many republicans voted to
pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery?

39:06.090 --> 39:07.430
How many?

39:07.510 --> 39:08.410
All of them.

39:08.510 --> 39:09.800
Every single one.

39:09.900 --> 39:13.530
Well,I would agree with you
if this were the 19th century.

39:13.590 --> 39:17.320
But you have to agree the democrats
do more... for jobs and education today.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.750
That depends on what you mean by "more.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.850
Gee.

39:23.390 --> 39:25.430
It never stops. -Yes.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.940
Hello?

39:30.680 --> 39:32.170
Okay,thanks.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.340
Bye.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.240
Something wrong?

39:35.300 --> 39:38.090
Robert's campaign is about
to take a serious hit.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.030
Why?

39:40.670 --> 39:45.700
There was a story brewing calling
into question his military service.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.470
I thought I killed it.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.730
Turns out the "drudge
report" is running with it.

39:49.810 --> 39:51.300
Oh,my god.

39:51.380 --> 39:54.380
I should call robert and
have him brace himself.

39:54.450 --> 39:56.360
Isaac...

39:56.930 --> 39:59.600
Can they do anything about it tonight?

39:59.960 --> 40:01.740
Not much,I'm afraid.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.860
It's their wedding night.

40:04.890 --> 40:06.930
At least give them that.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.410
Just keep your eyes closed.

40:13.470 --> 40:14.400
Come on.

40:14.460 --> 40:15.900
No cheating. -I'm not cheating.

40:17.970 --> 40:19.290
What did you-What did you
do?Did you get me a pup-

40:19.370 --> 40:21.390
You'll see. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.

40:21.450 --> 40:23.010
Okay,open 'em.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.430
Oh,my god.

40:26.970 --> 40:30.400
I wanted to start the honeymoon
early since we only have 36 hours.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.170
Oh,robert,it's beautiful.

40:34.430 --> 40:37.730
Oh,god,I wish hawaii
had more electoral votes.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.490
No,no,we're not even
gonna discuss the campaign.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.020
Okay?

40:42.080 --> 40:43.360
Oh,my feet.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.640
Wait a minute. What are you
doing?What about the crew?

40:45.700 --> 40:49.320
The crew is under strict instructions
not to even come in to this compartment.

40:54.590 --> 40:56.210
Thanks.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.910
Nice place.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.510
David?

41:08.570 --> 41:10.210
Holly.

41:10.580 --> 41:15.850
So I was reading about this wedding
in the newspaper,and I see your name,

41:15.930 --> 41:20.840
And I think,holly harper- How the
hell did she end up owning a winery?

41:21.130 --> 41:23.260
Why didn't you just call?

41:23.380 --> 41:25.640
Why not stop by and see you in person?

41:27.050 --> 41:30.090
You look,um,amazing.

41:30.150 --> 41:31.600
Thanks.

41:31.930 --> 41:33.850
You look-
Like crap.

41:33.910 --> 41:35.140
I know.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.380
To tell you the truth,I didn't
even know if it'd be you.

41:38.470 --> 41:41.350
Holly harper I knew
used to be an actress.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.640
She's not that anymore.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.110
Yeah,I can see that.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.480
This is,uh,this is quite an operation.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.230
It's very impressive.

41:51.430 --> 41:55.640
You can't expect me to believe that
you came here this late at night

41:55.710 --> 41:59.950
After that many years to find
out if'm still in show business.

42:04.350 --> 42:05.330
Who's this?

42:05.410 --> 42:07.020
That's rebecca.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.190
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?
