is laminated glass.

sheets of glass

is regular window glass.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.166
I'm ready to shoot an rpg
how about you guys?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.066
I think it's
truck-hunting season

09:46.067 --> 09:47.499
at new Mexico tech.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.332
So, we're back here
at new Mexico tech...

09:50.333 --> 09:52.132
You know, the school
where you can get a degree

09:52.133 --> 09:53.632
in blowing [Bleep] up.

09:53.633 --> 09:56.632
Well, last time we were here,
we made an rpg meet a bullet,

09:56.633 --> 09:58.499
and you all remember
how that went.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.832
Narrator: Yep... whenever
the mythbusters get to grips

10:00.833 --> 10:03.432
with rocket-propelled grenades,

10:03.433 --> 10:05.600
the results are explosive.

10:07.567 --> 10:10.866
So, first, they prep
their stationary s.U.V.

10:10.867 --> 10:14.199
With the car ready
for the limelight,

10:14.200 --> 10:18.399
it's maneuvered into position,
and then the firepower arrives.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.532
What i have inside this box

10:19.533 --> 10:21.532
are the actual
rocket-propelled grenades.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.832
These things are capable
of punching a hole

10:23.833 --> 10:26.099
through 6-inch-thick
steel plate.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.632
They're actually a shaped charge
designed to Pierce armor.

10:29.633 --> 10:32.866
Kari: If you remember from
our previous episode,

10:32.867 --> 10:34.399
this is how an rpg,

10:34.400 --> 10:36.032
or a rocket-propelled grenade,
works.

10:36.033 --> 10:38.032
A primer sets off
the launch motor,

10:38.033 --> 10:39.432
pushes it out of the tube,

10:39.433 --> 10:41.499
acceleration arms the rpg,

10:41.500 --> 10:45.932
and on impact, the piezoelectric
switch detonates

10:45.933 --> 10:48.766
and hopefully flips over
an s.U.V.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.399
Narrator: Hopefully.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.899
So, while ordnance tech
John myrkle loads the launcher,

10:53.900 --> 10:55.432
the team goes underground...

10:55.433 --> 10:57.366

I love this place.

10:57.367 --> 11:00.166
Narrator:
And waits for the all-clear.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.366
So, we've retreated
to the bunker

11:01.367 --> 11:02.699
because it's way too dangerous

11:02.700 --> 11:04.166
for us to be
anywhere near myrkle

11:04.167 --> 11:06.366
while he's loading the rpg

11:06.367 --> 11:07.566
when he's done there,

11:07.567 --> 11:08.899
then he's gonna come back here,

11:08.900 --> 11:10.366
and we're gonna do our test.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.832
Narrator: And with the grenade
locked and loaded,

11:12.833 --> 11:14.299
they're ready for the flip.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.632
[ Siren wails ]

11:15.633 --> 11:17.632
Okay. Here we go.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.599
This is s.U.V. Flip
with rpg

11:20.600 --> 11:23.267
in 3, 2, 1...

11:26.467 --> 11:29.499
Ho ho ho ho!
Oh, wow!

11:29.500 --> 11:33.132
Well, it didn't even come close
to flipping the s.U.V.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.299
What did it do?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.099
It looked like it kind of
blew out the front end.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.699
Yeah, it doesn't look
anything like in Hollywood.

11:38.700 --> 11:42.832
Narrator: It was
lights, camera, and action,

11:42.833 --> 11:46.433
but fact fell a long way
short of fiction...

11:47.767 --> 11:51.332
Because despite being hit
by a rocket-propelled grenade,

11:51.333 --> 11:56.632
there was absolutely
no liftoff for the s.U.V.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.299
Kari: [ Laughs ]

11:58.300 --> 12:01.199
Well, that was
mighty unimpressive.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.066
It looks cool, though.
Look at that hole.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.766
But look at that.
It just punches a hole.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.866
It didn't
blow it up and flip it.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.566
Narrator: So, although
the rpg shaped charge

12:09.567 --> 12:11.432
burrowed all the way
into the engine block,

12:11.433 --> 12:14.966
it wasn't enough
to match the movie magic.

12:14.967 --> 12:18.766
So the rpg did exactly
what it was designed to do,

12:18.767 --> 12:20.499
which is to Pierce the car

12:20.500 --> 12:23.099
and penetrate
into the engine block.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.232
What it didn't do was generate
a huge fireball

12:26.233 --> 12:28.199
like they do in Hollywood.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.932
And what's more,
the car didn't move at all.

12:31.933 --> 12:34.532
It's not looking very good
for this myth.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.932
Narrator: Indeed...
So far, they are 0 for 1,

12:36.933 --> 12:39.066
but will that change
when they give this myth

12:39.067 --> 12:41.067
some forward momentum?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.299
All: Whoa!

12:45.300 --> 12:47.466
Narrator:
Coming up on "mythbusters"...

how much i hate traffic?

12:49.967 --> 12:51.900
Well, now's your chance
to even the score.

13:04.533 --> 13:08.266

testing this slapstick shatter.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.567
[ Shouts ]
Uh-oh.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.399
Did you hear something?

13:13.400 --> 13:14.632
No.

And so far,

13:16.500 --> 13:20.532
one workman has been
"pane" -fully wounded.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.866
Oh, dude!
We got a gusher.

13:23.867 --> 13:26.532
But to get all the facts
of the shatter,

13:26.533 --> 13:30.766
they're trying some other
common types of glass.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.566
The next piece of glass
we're gonna be driving through

13:32.567 --> 13:34.799
in full scale
is laminated glass,

13:34.800 --> 13:36.666
referred to in the industry
as lami.

13:36.667 --> 13:40.066
Now, remember, this is
two panes of regular glass

13:40.067 --> 13:41.866
with a layer in between
of plastic

13:41.867 --> 13:44.132
that keeps
the whole thing together

13:44.133 --> 13:45.299
when you hit it.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.299
Will that happen when we hit it?

13:47.300 --> 13:48.832
That's what we're
about to find out.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.566
Narrator: So this
windshield glass is designed

13:50.567 --> 13:54.366
not to shatter on impact
but to stay in one piece.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.599
[ Laughs ]

13:55.600 --> 13:57.932
However, will that mean
that the workers

13:57.933 --> 14:01.333
get their slapstick happy ending
and remain unharmed?

14:03.067 --> 14:06.432
Well, this time around,
the hyneman is behind the wheel,

14:06.433 --> 14:09.166
and it's time to test
this hit-and-run.

14:09.167 --> 14:12.066

the pedal to the metal...

I'm okay. Are you okay?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.199
I'm totally fine.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.066
This time, it was
more fracture than fragment.

14:43.067 --> 14:47.066
But the laminated glass
did separate more than expected.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.299
Ah.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.766
The laminated glass
did not stay together.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.232

more or less stayed in,

14:53.233 --> 14:54.632

Also...

14:55.867 --> 14:56.932
No blood.

No blood at all.

14:58.533 --> 15:02.066
No blood whatsoever!

15:02.067 --> 15:04.067
That was a bloodless accident.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.399
Yep... on impact,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.832
the glass cleaved
into large chunks,

15:09.833 --> 15:13.132
meaning that the bleeders
may have felt "pane,"

15:13.133 --> 15:15.766
but they remained scratch-free.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.732
Adam: I have to say,
from inside the car,

15:17.733 --> 15:19.832
i was prepared
for a much bigger hit

15:19.833 --> 15:21.399
than we ended up
actually feeling,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.266
but i did have
the distinct impression

15:23.267 --> 15:25.866
once we touched
the laminated glass

15:25.867 --> 15:28.599
that we were driving through it
like a tunnel,

15:28.600 --> 15:31.632
and here before me
is exactly that story.

15:31.633 --> 15:35.767
Look at this...
A car-shaped hole in the glass.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.266

So, after two shatter tests,

15:40.267 --> 15:44.066
it's one apiece in
the injured-worker stakes.

15:44.067 --> 15:48.099
So, now time for the decider...
The tempered glass.

15:48.100 --> 15:53.132
But, will the so-called
safety glass be the safest yet?

15:53.133 --> 15:54.732
Oh, nice.
I'm happy with that.

15:54.733 --> 15:56.166
Adam gives it a spray

15:56.167 --> 15:58.166
to make it visible
on high-speed,

15:58.167 --> 16:01.499
and then it's make-or-break
for the myth.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.599
Adam: I have a prediction
as to how this is gonna go.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.566

any of those little pieces

are actually gonna harm

are gonna be fine.

It seems it's the way it
shatters that matters.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.599
The tempered glass
is designed to break

17:16.600 --> 17:19.599
into thousands
of tiny pieces on impact,

17:19.600 --> 17:22.499
but because those pieces
are flying through the air

17:22.500 --> 17:24.199
at 30 miles an hour,

17:24.200 --> 17:25.866

about one thing.

The tempered glass did break
into a million little pieces.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.399
About everything else,
i was pretty off the mark.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.666

from the point of impact.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.066
Well, a good portion of it did,

17:40.067 --> 17:41.832
but about half of it also
went backwards

an rpg can flip an s.U.V.

But so far,
that hasn't been the case.

if that momentum

Now, for this test,
it's critically important

19:01.967 --> 19:05.066
that the s.U.V. Be moving
in a straight line

19:05.067 --> 19:06.666

To keep the s.U.V.
Going straight,

19:10.200 --> 19:12.532
we have a pole in front
and a pole in back

to start the test,

we fire a cable cutter
that releases it

19:39.300 --> 19:42.266
Grant: All right.
Here we go.

19:42.267 --> 19:45.666
Like last time, the rpg
will hit the hood head on,

19:45.667 --> 19:49.932
but will that flip the s.U.V.
Off its wheels?

19:49.933 --> 19:51.166
All right... s.U.V. Away

19:51.167 --> 19:54.600
in 3, 2, 1, fire!

19:56.667 --> 19:58.566
The s.U.V. Is released...

19:58.567 --> 20:00.666
It's picking up speed.

20:00.667 --> 20:05.066
And gravity propels it
to its rpg destiny.

20:05.067 --> 20:07.266
All: Oh!
[ Laughter ]

20:07.267 --> 20:09.399
Wow! Did you see
the front end?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.932
Looked like it popped up a bit.

20:10.933 --> 20:13.966
Grant: Yeah, it popped up,
but that's not a flip.

20:13.967 --> 20:15.599
That means this is busted.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.932
It was so cool, but it's busted.

20:17.933 --> 20:20.366
Totally.
But that was a nice shot.

20:20.367 --> 20:22.432
Narrator: Nice shot.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.699
Still, no flippin' cigar.

20:24.700 --> 20:28.466
In fact, the rpg
didn't even stop the s.U.V.,

20:28.467 --> 20:31.199
and the car
continued to roll up the bank.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.132
Grant:
So, this myth is busted.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.466
Well, when you think about it,
the job of an rpg

20:35.467 --> 20:37.232
is not to flip vehicles.

20:37.233 --> 20:39.666
It's designed to Pierce armor,

20:39.667 --> 20:41.066
and that's exactly what it did.

20:41.067 --> 20:43.232
It punched through
the condenser, the radiator,

20:43.233 --> 20:45.332
all the way into
the engine block,

20:45.333 --> 20:47.332
but it did not flip the vehicle.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.566
[ Projector runs ]

20:49.567 --> 20:51.999
Narrator: Yep... there's
no doubt that the live action

20:52.000 --> 20:54.699
doesn't match the action film,

20:54.700 --> 20:57.966
but that's never deterred
the mythbusters before.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.832
Tory: This myth is busted,
but we're not gonna stop here.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.732
No, this is my favorite part
of the show,

21:02.733 --> 21:04.699
where we're gonna
replicate the results.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.500
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

21:16.167 --> 21:19.066
Narrator: Next up,
it's a cinematic solution

21:19.067 --> 21:21.432
to traffic jams.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.066
So what's our next crash myth?

21:23.067 --> 21:24.632
Well, it's a common movie trope.

21:24.633 --> 21:25.932
First, i need you to picture

21:25.933 --> 21:28.332
a couple of lines of cars
sitting in traffic

21:28.333 --> 21:29.766
when another character
in the movie

21:29.767 --> 21:32.799
is driving a giant truck
at high speed along city streets

21:32.800 --> 21:35.066
when he approaches
these cars standing still.

21:35.067 --> 21:37.132
There's not enough space for him
to get through, but no matter.

21:37.133 --> 21:39.732
He revs his engine
and barrels right up the middle,

21:39.733 --> 21:43.166
sending cars flying Willy-nilly
and continuing on his way.

21:43.167 --> 21:44.766
I don't know whether that
would happen or not,

21:44.767 --> 21:47.366
but sounds like
it's gonna be fun to test it.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.066
Yep...
According to the movies,

21:49.067 --> 21:51.966
a tailback is no match
for a truck.

21:51.967 --> 21:56.232
But could you really keep on
truckin' through traffic

21:56.233 --> 21:59.532
or is this big-rig barge rigged?

21:59.533 --> 22:01.532
Look, i think
we get a bunch of cars,

22:01.533 --> 22:03.732
put them out on the tarmac,
get a giant truck,

22:03.733 --> 22:05.666
and see if we can't
plow right through.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.532
And i think I've got
just the truck.

22:07.533 --> 22:08.732
Awesome.

22:08.733 --> 22:11.767
When it comes
to head-on collisions...

22:13.767 --> 22:14.767

This truck has had
its fair share

22:19.067 --> 22:21.066
And for jato 3,

a rocket-proof bunker.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.866
[ Laughs ]

22:25.867 --> 22:28.232
So now it's armored, dangerous,

22:28.233 --> 22:31.066
and perfect
for ramming into traffic.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.699
Well, almost.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.766
If our dump truck
is going to survive

22:34.767 --> 22:36.666
pushing through
two lines of cars,

22:36.667 --> 22:38.532
it's gonna need
a super-powerful bumper.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.132
Okay.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.399
So we're putting on
a much more powerful bumper.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.099
This steel, these tubes,

22:44.100 --> 22:47.099
6x8 inches,
1/2-inch-thick steel.

was a curse,

22:52.567 --> 22:54.332

bolstering the bumper

23:04.233 --> 23:07.732
This gives a whole new meaning
to driving a car.

If we're gonna drive our truck
into a couple of lines of cars,

[ Laughs ]

23:21.933 --> 23:24.432
Narrator:
So, with 10 cars in 2 lines

23:24.433 --> 23:26.532
and a dump truck ready to rage,

23:26.533 --> 23:29.899
will there be some fact
to the Hollywood fiction?

23:29.900 --> 23:32.266
Jamie: This truck weighs
over 30,000 pounds.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.332
Those 10 cars over there
also add up

23:34.333 --> 23:36.532
to somewhere over 30,000 pounds.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.499
But the thing is,
the truck's gonna be moving

23:38.500 --> 23:40.966
at around 40 miles an hour
when it hits them,

23:40.967 --> 23:44.299
so it's gonna impart
several times its own weight

23:44.300 --> 23:45.866
to those cars.

23:45.867 --> 23:48.299
And that means
the truck is gonna win.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.832
But whether it also means
that it's gonna be able

23:50.833 --> 23:53.566
to move completely
through the cars and keep going,

23:53.567 --> 23:55.332
like it does in the movies,
or not,

23:55.333 --> 23:59.232

and that I'm not so sure about.

down the runway...

Yep... "awesome"
just about covers it,

the truck would make it

25:17.667 --> 25:19.332
all the way through the queue,

25:19.333 --> 25:22.066
but eventually,
that 10-car pileup

25:22.067 --> 25:24.300
proved too much
for the dump truck.

25:26.333 --> 25:29.066
Well, clearly,
the first two cars we hit

25:29.067 --> 25:31.666
were the worst off
for this impact,

25:31.667 --> 25:34.832
but all of the cars actually got
quite a bit of damage.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.099

amount of impact

Adam:
So, let me play out for you

25:42.600 --> 25:44.899
what this scene of damage
actually represents.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.132
These two cars here

25:46.133 --> 25:48.632
have skipped forward
by two full car lengths.

25:50.267 --> 25:52.966
by one whole times
its own length.

25:52.967 --> 25:55.066
That means
that the truck stopped

25:55.067 --> 25:58.366
at just about where the fourth
cars were in the line.

25:58.367 --> 26:00.899

did a number on the traffic,

26:00.900 --> 26:04.932
it failed to ram the entire jam.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.599

26:06.600 --> 26:08.299
with that bumper on it
couldn't do it,

The team is on the flip side
of the s.U.V. Spin,

is nothing but Hollywood hype.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.600

26:43.601 --> 26:44.899
I think we owe it to our fans

to give them the Hollywood-style
flip that they want to see

26:47.433 --> 26:49.132

some tinseltown tactics...

in this tale.

we're gonna need three things.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.632
We're gonna need
some sort of dummy rpg

that explodes

and something
that flips the s.U.V.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.799
And that's what we're gonna do.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.066
Narrator: So it's
destination silver screen,

27:14.067 --> 27:18.232
and step one requires something
to flip the s.U.V.

is gonna give us the punch

27:21.433 --> 27:24.799

do the flipping on the car.

A lot of the weight
has been removed

27:26.533 --> 27:28.799

as you can see.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.732
There's a distinct
lack of engine.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.432
All i have to do
is put some supports in here

27:33.433 --> 27:36.099
and then mount the Cannon.

the lack of engine...

in the car.

looks like an s.U.V.

is welded to a trench plate

is carefully lowered onto it.

get a real rpg?

was to get it to fire

for this stunt.

this fake grenade launcher,

and the way
I'm gonna get this to fly

28:39.700 --> 28:41.432
is I'm gonna use a model rocket.

Now, the way we're gonna be able
to hit our s.U.V.

28:43.367 --> 28:46.966
Is we're gonna have a guideline
from our hero into the s.U.V.

To start
this whole car flip off.

a fake grenade in the chamber,

they'll need something extra
to create the big-screen boom.

Now for our big Hollywood boom.

28:57.067 --> 29:00.066

explosive of c-4.

the pushing power of anfo.

So we're gonna just do
a little pyrotechnic trick.

We're going to use some fuel
and get the kind of explosion

29:12.267 --> 29:16.199
that gives us a fireball without
actually a "boom" explosion.

to re-create

they were expecting.

douse the wreckage,

30:13.900 --> 30:16.032
it's clear that this stunt
was a little more

30:16.033 --> 30:19.132

than classic Hollywood.

30:19.133 --> 30:21.233
Now, we shot the rpg.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.799
The gas bomb went off,
but for some reason,

30:25.800 --> 30:27.766
the nitrogen piston didn't fire,

30:27.767 --> 30:29.466

the car didn't flip.

right through the middle.

is six triangular plates

that this semi-conical frame
will come in low on the cars,

40:08.000 --> 40:09.966
Yeah!

40:09.967 --> 40:12.232
Yeah!

40:12.233 --> 40:13.566
Whoo!

40:13.567 --> 40:15.766
Yeah!

40:15.767 --> 40:17.366
Give me some!

40:17.367 --> 40:19.566
Yeah!

40:19.567 --> 40:22.432
Incredibly,
not only did the truck

40:22.433 --> 40:25.099
make it all the way
through 16 cars,

40:25.100 --> 40:28.399
Adam and Jamie kept on truckin'
down the runway,

40:28.400 --> 40:31.932
meaning this attempt won
by a nose.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.299
[ Laughs ]

40:33.300 --> 40:35.799
That was amazing!

40:35.800 --> 40:37.632
Holy crap!

40:37.633 --> 40:39.899
That was insane!

40:39.900 --> 40:42.366
"Insane" is the right word.

40:42.367 --> 40:46.667
[ Laughing ]

40:50.867 --> 40:52.432
It just didn't stop.

40:52.433 --> 40:53.699
It didn't stop.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.766
I kept giving it gas,
and it didn't stop.

40:55.767 --> 40:57.832
If anything,
it was self-centering.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.432
That was the most incredible
thing we've ever done.

41:00.433 --> 41:02.832
I've never experienced
anything like that.

41:02.833 --> 41:06.332
It was just... they were
just kind of, like, flying.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.299
We could've kept going
through 100 cars.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.099
Adam: I really
feel like we could've.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.632
We weren't going
that much slower.

41:11.633 --> 41:13.966
We didn't take nearly
the impact on that run

41:13.967 --> 41:15.432
as we did on the first run.

41:15.433 --> 41:17.699
I think we just solved
my traffic problem.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.066
[ Laughs ]

41:19.067 --> 41:20.732
I'm gonna put one of these
on my car.

41:20.733 --> 41:21.932
Oh, my god.

41:21.933 --> 41:25.832
Narrator: The guys are clearly
duckbillin' delirious.

41:25.833 --> 41:29.232
[ Both laughing ]

41:29.233 --> 41:32.232
I'm... I'm a little drunk
on adrenaline right now.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.666
I believe even though this car
is upright and that one, too,

41:34.667 --> 41:36.432
that they both did a full roll,

41:36.433 --> 41:38.599
as judging from the glass here

41:38.600 --> 41:41.366
and all of its contents
being on the road.

41:41.367 --> 41:45.866
This is amazing. It's like
a triangle of pure destruction.

41:45.867 --> 41:49.666
That experience
was almost indescribable.

41:49.667 --> 41:52.132
I mean, it was over in a second,

41:52.133 --> 41:55.599
but these cars are just, like...
I'm speechless.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.866
They're just kind of
going like this.

41:57.867 --> 42:01.832
It worked.
I don't know what else to say.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.832
Adam: Here's a cool way to think
about what you see here.

42:03.833 --> 42:06.266
Imagine that our dump truck
was a boat,

42:06.267 --> 42:09.132
and then these cars
are its wake.

42:09.133 --> 42:10.732
That's right... not water,

42:10.733 --> 42:15.066
but a wake of 60,000 pounds
of steel.

42:15.067 --> 42:16.733
It's kind of poetic.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.432
Jamie: You know,
you think things through,

42:21.433 --> 42:23.566
and you engineer something,

42:23.567 --> 42:26.566
and you kind of
take your best shot.

42:26.567 --> 42:29.632
I have to say that was
one of our best shots.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.266
That could not
have worked better.

42:32.267 --> 42:35.932
And given the chaos
of this sort of situation,

42:35.933 --> 42:39.333
I'm really proud of that.
That was... that was cool.

42:42.167 --> 42:46.832
Narrator: Yes, it truly was
something to be proud of,

42:46.833 --> 42:49.332
as the truck cut an epic swathe

42:49.333 --> 42:53.300
through 60,000 pounds
of steel...

42:56.467 --> 42:58.166
in an uplifting ode

42:58.167 --> 43:02.233
to the incontrovertible
laws of physics.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.766
Well, the myth was busted.

43:08.767 --> 43:11.532
Where do we stand on our method
for plowing through traffic?

43:11.533 --> 43:13.899
That thing worked so well,
I'm just waiting for somebody

43:13.900 --> 43:15.466
to steal it
and put it in a movie.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.699
Totally.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.499
Remember, kids, you saw it
on "mythbusters" first.

43:19.500 --> 43:22.499
Did i ever tell you
how much i hate traffic?

43:22.500 --> 43:23.899
[ Both laugh ]

43:23.900 --> 43:26.166
We have to find an excuse
to do that again.

43:26.167 --> 43:28.433
Yeah, that was fun.
