00:01.001 --> 00:02.170
ADULT ADAM: Back before
you could buy

00:02.203 --> 00:04.772
everything ever
on Amazon and eBay,

00:04.805 --> 00:07.608
you had to go to
an actual store to buy toys.

00:07.641 --> 00:11.345
For me, the toy store
was a sacred mecca
of my lifelong passion.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.813
Even though
I was getting older,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.782
my toy obsession
was for life.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.184
Devastator's on sale?

00:16.217 --> 00:17.485
Score.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.288
Transformers?
We just got in a new shipment
of Rock Lords.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.123
I don't know what that is,
but I want them all.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.392
They're GoBots
that transform...

00:25.493 --> 00:26.760
...into rocks.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.961
A toy rock?

00:27.995 --> 00:29.530
That defines fun.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.232
Take all my lunch money.
Take it right now.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.834
Oh, you're too late.
I knew these would be
a hot commodity,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.536
so I bought every last
Rock Lord.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.037
Thanks a lot, suck lord.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.872
What'd you call me?
Nothing.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.041
Little did I know,
my trip to the toy store

00:41.075 --> 00:44.011
was about to be overshadowed
by some major news.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.814
Whoa!
Kiddo, what you doing?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.049
The Berlin Wall's
coming down.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.151
This is more important.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.885
But there's freedom
in Europe.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.222
ADAM: Nothing is
as historicalas this.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.723
They're about to announce
the deadline

00:55.756 --> 00:57.991
for this year's shopping spree
at Toys "R" Us.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.893
Yep, back in the day,
there was a contest

00:59.927 --> 01:04.098
where one lucky kid got
five glorious minutes
to grab whatever they wanted,

01:04.132 --> 01:06.834
and every year,
I dreamed that kid
would be me.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.669
It's simple.
You just send in a postcard,

01:08.702 --> 01:09.870
and they choose
one lucky winner

01:09.903 --> 01:12.173
to run around a toy store
and grab anything they want.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.674
It's bigger than
that sports game

01:13.707 --> 01:14.908
where the winner
goes to Disneyland.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.745
You know, I entered
a sweepstakes as a kid.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.847
Won a big can of peaches.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.816
Well, it wasn't that big.
It was a small can.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.518
But a good peach
is a real treat.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.686
So you get my excitement.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.822
Do you actually have a shot
at winning this toy thing?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.191
I wish.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.526
Last year, Dad only
gave me enough money
for two lousy stamps.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.695
I'll pay you twice that
right now if you leave.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.631
Fine. But if I win, I'm not
grabbing you anything.

01:37.665 --> 01:38.999
Pops, what would you like?
Name it.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.203
How about one of
those backscratchers
your father loves?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.037
Backscratcher?
It's a toy store.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.739
He's talking about
this thing.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.475
That's my Hot Wheels track!

01:47.508 --> 01:49.410
No, don't rub that
against your body.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.044
Ah, damn it,
I can't get it.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.446
Al, come on and reach in.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.647
Get no man's land.
Come on.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.816
Is this good?
Ahh.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.220
* I'm twisted up inside

01:59.253 --> 02:02.122
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:05.125 --> 02:06.627
* I don't know the future

02:06.660 --> 02:09.863
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:09.897 --> 02:12.300
ADULT ADAM:
It was November 7th,
1980-something,

02:12.333 --> 02:15.102
and my sister and her band
were watching Star Search.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.105
Long before American Idol,
this was the one big show

02:18.138 --> 02:21.041
that turned regular people
into overnight superstars.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.244
We got to get
on Star Search.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.978
I mean, it'll be
the fastest way to get famous

02:25.012 --> 02:26.680
without having to do
any work whatsoever.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.916
Yes! That idea is
so perfect for us.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.051
Then it's settled.
We'll win Star Search.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.354
You know, I've been secretly
second-guessing our decision

02:33.387 --> 02:35.923
to drop out of college
until this very moment.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.626
Now all we need is
the perfect audition song.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.661
You know, I wrote a song
that may just do the trick.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.932
I Wanna Rock Your Body?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.834
Dude, I love this title!
Let's do it.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.069
And I love the rest
of the words.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.776
* I saw you
cross the dance floor

02:55.809 --> 02:59.380
* And I know what
you're looking for

02:59.413 --> 03:01.949
* I'm feelin' a bit naughty

03:02.950 --> 03:05.453
* I wanna rock your body *

03:05.486 --> 03:08.188
Guys. I like what
my ears are hearing.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.525
That's the song you wrote
about rocking my body, right?
What?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.261
Uh...
What?

03:13.294 --> 03:16.297
Well, I mean, the body in
the song that's being rocked
obviously belongs to someone.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.165
Who does the body
belong to, Lainey?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.167
Barry.
Barry?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.335
My brother Barry?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.103
My... My mother's son
Barry?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.272
Barry Barry?

03:24.305 --> 03:27.375
Yeah, this is what
you're singing about.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.642
We are...

03:28.676 --> 03:30.344
...never doing
that horrible song.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.846
Look, we agreed our band's
a democracy, so we vote on it.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.682
Raise your hand if yes
to rocking Barry's body.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.151
No! No, you do not
get to vote.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.320
You are not even
in our band.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.554
But my body is.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.423
It's part of the band's
musical legacy.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.358
Erica, any way you swing it,
you're outvoted,

03:44.392 --> 03:46.193
which means this is
our audition song.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.295
From the top.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.763
* You're a sexy hotty *

03:49.797 --> 03:51.532
Ow!

03:52.800 --> 03:55.736
I was forced to sing about
my brother's soft torso.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.739
Okay, that's just wrong.
You should be singing about
my soft torso.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.608
Stupid band democracy.
You know, for once,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.175
I would love to sing
on my own

04:02.209 --> 04:03.711
without needing
group permission.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.314
Hey,
no one ever said recording
a hit record was easy.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.015
ADULT ADAM: Oh, but it was,

04:08.048 --> 04:10.751
thanks to the classic '80s
mall recording booth.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.786
Whoa, what is that?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.355
Hi, I'm John Calabasas,

04:14.388 --> 04:15.723
and you're looking
at Willow Grove's

04:15.756 --> 04:19.627
first Professional
Recording Booth
and Lip Sync Studio Palace.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.696
Do you perchance dabble in
the art of vocal songestry?

04:22.730 --> 04:25.232
Does she? She's in, like,
the best band in Jenkintown.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.600
We're not.
I mean, we're good.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.968
Maybe the best.
Whatever.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.203
Look, I don't know you,
and I've never heard you sing,

04:30.237 --> 04:31.939
but the second I heard
you mention anything

04:31.972 --> 04:33.441
remotely connected
to music,

04:33.474 --> 04:36.444
I knew that I was looking
at a future rock-'n'-roll
superstar.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.380
No way. I mean,
maybe. Sure, yes.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.783
"Sure, yes" is right,
and I insist that you come
and record a demo.

04:42.816 --> 04:46.720
So I've slashed my usual
rate of $500 a session

04:46.754 --> 04:49.757
to the impossibly low price
of just $19.95.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.091
That's such
a deep discount.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.526
This guy knows his math.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.728
Look, I'm being financially
irresponsible over here,

04:54.762 --> 04:57.465
but I really feel like
this lady's voice
has got to be heard.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.600
You're so amazingly generous.
She'll do it.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.768
ADULT ADAM:
And just like that,

05:00.801 --> 05:03.203
Erica was cutting
her first real demo

05:03.236 --> 05:06.474
in a mall,
and she picked
a real doozy.

05:06.507 --> 05:11.445
* Mama, just killed a man *

05:12.413 --> 05:14.214
Uh, I got to stop you.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.017
So, you really can
actually really sing.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.486
Yeah, so?

05:18.519 --> 05:21.955
So, I'm not used
to hearing people sing
like actual singers.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.557
Like I said,
she's in an awesome band.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.758
They may even be
on Star Search.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.126
Star Search the TV show?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.561
Well, it's a possibility.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.930
Okay, look, I'm gonna be
half-honest with you guys.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.466
Before,
when I said you're gonna
be a rock-'n'-roll superstar,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.569
I wanted to believe it
because I'm an optimist
with a big heart,

05:35.603 --> 05:37.671
but now I really
do believe it.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.006
And I want to be
your manager.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.140
Seriously?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.643
You just got discovered
in a mall!
This always happens!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.712
Great! But there are two
other girls in the band.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.347
Look, I can tell just from how
I know nothing about them

05:47.381 --> 05:49.950
that those no-talent hacks
are holding you back.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.953
But if you go solo,
we will for sure
conquer the music biz.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.355
**

05:55.389 --> 05:57.991
So, they stack one
on top of the other?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.527
I have seen everything.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.961
And to think,
all this time,

06:00.994 --> 06:04.164
I've just been
storing my cereal
in the box it came in.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.332
Pardon me, ladies.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.367
I'm filming
a super important
battlescape,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.603
and my camera's picking up
all your tuppery talk.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.439
Sorry, Schmooey.
We'll do better.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.906
C'mon, gals.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.643
Let's take our food-storage
party into the living room.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.377
I don't understand.
What is he doing?

06:17.411 --> 06:18.912
What

06:18.946 --> 06:20.280
What's with
the judgy murmuring?

06:20.313 --> 06:23.551
Bevy, we think it's time
we had a Yenta-vention.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.318
About what?
About Adam.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.987
Look, we all love
his creativity

06:27.020 --> 06:29.189
and his wild imagination
as much as you do.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.659
It's just that...
He's an adult
who plays with dolls.

06:31.692 --> 06:35.062
And you're an adult
who smells like
a sack of monkey .

06:35.095 --> 06:37.297
You're lashing out.
I'm lashing out.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.299
Bev, I know this is
hard to hear,

06:39.332 --> 06:42.670
but you know Adam's too old
to be playing with toys,
and it's getting kind of...

06:42.703 --> 06:44.505
Weird and sad.
Sad and weird.

06:44.538 --> 06:49.510
How could you seriously think
that Adam's favorite lifetime
hobby is in any way weird?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.711
It's crazy!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.379
(IMITATING FLYING,
SHOOTING LASERS)

06:52.412 --> 06:54.214
Damn it!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.749
I grew out
of my laser voice.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.052
Murray.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.555
Everybody thinks Adam
is both sad and weird.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.424
Sure.
You're his father.
Help him be better.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.595
Give the kid a break.
He's only 12.
He's 16!

07:07.628 --> 07:09.296
That can't be right.
Well, it is.

07:09.329 --> 07:13.100
Now get off your ass
and go teach him
a real adult hobby.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.367
What do I know from hobbies?

07:14.401 --> 07:15.435
I don't have
any stupid hobbies.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.670
Is that right?

07:16.704 --> 07:19.039
Stamps, Murray.
You love stamps.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.373
That is your hobby.

07:20.407 --> 07:22.510
Hobbies are dumb and silly.

07:22.543 --> 07:26.279
Stamps are a smart
financial investment.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.115
You know,
Rock Hudson got a stamp.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.517
Good for him, right?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.451
Okay, I don't care
what the hell you call it.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.854
Just show Adam
how much fun you have

07:33.887 --> 07:35.255
stamping with your stamps.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.726
Fine. I'll introduce Adam
to the noble world
of stamp collecting,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.427
but once again,
not a hobby.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.362
Stamps are serious business.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.066
Snoopy!
Silly puppy.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.300
Right there.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.202
**

07:51.471 --> 07:52.540
What the hell is this?

07:52.573 --> 07:53.807
It's a demo she had made
at the mall.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.142
We came here to
confront her about it.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
I know that. I was just
being dramatic.
Oh.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.345
You made a demo
without us?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.180
No. Geoff just paid
for me to sing

08:00.213 --> 08:01.882
at some dumb recording booth
at the mall,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.316
but thanks for thinking
the worst of me.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.918
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
We're insecure people.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.287
I mean, did a talent manager
ask to rep me?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.157
Yes. But I told him
I'm in a band
and basically not interested.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.726
"Basically"?
So you are interested?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.028
She's so gonna ditch us
and go solo.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.130
Guys, I would never go solo.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.966
I mean, did I crush
Bohemian Rhapsody?

08:18.999 --> 08:22.570
Obviously.
And did it floor a manager
with my soulful angel voice

08:22.603 --> 08:24.504
dripping with polished talent?
Of course.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.107
Wait, you did
Bohemian Rhapsody?
So?

08:27.140 --> 08:28.942
It's the greatest rock song
ever written,

08:28.976 --> 08:30.978
and you and I both know
I am the only one

08:31.011 --> 08:32.646
with the vocal chops
to do it justice.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.182
You seriously think you're the
Freddie Mercury of this band?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.050
Oh, I know
I'm the Freddie Mercury.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.519
You are so not
the Freddie Mercury.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.854
If anything,
I'm Freddie Mercury.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.824
We all know a band only has
one Freddie Mercury,
which is me.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.225
Well, if I'm not
the Freddie Mercury,

08:45.258 --> 08:47.661
then why did my manager
sign me and not you?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.396
You said he wasn't
your manager!

08:49.429 --> 08:50.764
BARRY: Band splitting up?

08:50.798 --> 08:52.766
Yeah, I knew
this would happen.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.936
No, and go away.
You're dripping Popsicle
all over yourself.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.005
Or am I dripping knowledge?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.040
Fact! Lainey doesn't
need any of you

09:00.073 --> 09:02.009
'cause she has
the best manager
of all time

09:02.042 --> 09:04.144
who started yesterday...
Me.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
You hear that?
I'm going solo, not you.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.016
Doesn't matter
'cause I just went solo
right here in this moment.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.385
You both can't go solo
because then I'm left alone,
and I have to go solo, too.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.989
Don't blame me.
I only went solo because
Lainey went solo first.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.258
Actually, it just so happens
my solo project
needs a drummer.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.359
Done.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.729
**

09:21.762 --> 09:23.797
Okay, toy time's over,
moron.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.432
This isn't toy time.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.901
It's the
Transformers/Star Wars
crossover event

09:27.935 --> 09:29.236
the world's been begging for.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.005
That's gibberish
for "toy time,"
and you're too old for it.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.307
Here's how actual normal
adult people have fun.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.810
It's just a book of postage.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.546
It's a collection of stamps.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.381
Ohh, I get it.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.718
See, you grew up
in olden times when
there were no toys.

09:44.752 --> 09:48.989
All you had were dolls
made out of corn cobs
and a stick and a hoop.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.991
That's why you're an angry,
broken man

09:51.024 --> 09:52.592
who thinks stamps
are a hobby.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.028
Learn about stamps
or you're grounded, moron.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.699
Fine. I'll give your tiny,
lickable history squares
a stupid chance.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.368
And if you take to them,
maybe my stamp collection

10:01.401 --> 10:03.436
can become
our stamp collection.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.872
I can have the stamps?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.307
I don't see why not
as long as you give up
plastic toys and robits.

10:07.340 --> 10:11.378
Come to think of it,
I may actually get
a lot out of these things.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.948
ADULT ADAM: That day,
I really came to appreciate
my dad's stamps...

10:14.982 --> 10:17.184
By using them
as actual stamps.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.186
ADAM: Buckle up, Pops.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.021
Your favorite grandson
is guaranteed

10:21.054 --> 10:22.856
to win the contest
of a lifetime.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.257
I see what this is.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.426
You rigged the contest, huh?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.261
I did that with the peaches.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.030
No, I won this
fair and square.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.065
I mailed in
over 600 entries.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.802
Whoa! Where'd
you get the dough
for all that postage?

10:34.835 --> 10:36.203
Dad gave me all his stamps.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.271
Those stamps
aren't for mailing.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.673
They're for admiring.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.641
Chill!
I thought of everything.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.043
See, when I win the contest,

10:43.076 --> 10:44.912
I get thousands of dollars
in toys.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.780
I'll just sell a few bikes
and Nintendos

10:46.814 --> 10:48.415
and buy back
all of Dad's stamps.

10:48.448 --> 10:52.085
That actually makes
a shred of sense.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.954
MAN: Okay,
the big moment's here.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.958
This year, Toys "R" Us
received a record number
two million entries!

10:57.991 --> 11:00.227
Wha... What he say?
Oh, no.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.795
And the winner is...

11:01.829 --> 11:03.230
Maria Hernandez!

11:03.263 --> 11:04.664
Oh, no.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.833
Oh, balls, no!

11:05.866 --> 11:06.934
You didn't win.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.268
I know I didn't win, Pops!

11:08.301 --> 11:11.238
You're in serious trouble.
Oh, no.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.605
Oh, no, I really am.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.841
Oh, no!

11:13.874 --> 11:14.975
Oh, no!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.277
(BREATHES HEAVILY,
WHIMPERS)

11:17.310 --> 11:19.546
ADULT ADAM: After the Dropouts
were dropped by Erica,

11:19.579 --> 11:22.182
they decided to audition
for Star Search without her.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.518
* To me

11:27.120 --> 11:29.656
Dude, Ed McMahon
is gonna spill

11:29.689 --> 11:31.725
his giant tumbler of scotch
when he hears this.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.294
We are so the stars
Star Search is searching for.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.163
What the hell?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
You stole my audition song?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.632
You can't steal her song.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.335
Last time I checked,
Queen wrote the song.
We're just covering it.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.703
But she's right,
Queen did write it.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.273
I'm doing the Rhapsody.
You can't have
two Rhapsodies.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.474
That's true,
you can't have two.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.641
Then pick another rhapsody.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.743
Maybe you should
pick another?

11:49.777 --> 11:51.945
There's only one rhapsody,
and it's the Bohemian one.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.547
But it doesn't matter.
Good luck with your little
Queen cover.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.050
I have a real manager,
and he already booked
me a gig.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.185
No way.
What?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.386
Managers book gigs?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.354
Oh, yeah.
I'm playing the food court

12:01.388 --> 12:03.190
at the Willow Grove Mall
tomorrow.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.592
The food court? But that has,
like, tons of foot traffic.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.062
And it's where I'm recording
my Star Search tape
in front of a live audience.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.530
You can't do a live audition.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.133
You'll feed off the energy
of the crowd.
You can't do this to us.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.768
Managers book gigs?

12:14.802 --> 12:17.204
ADULT ADAM: As Erica
went Hollywood
on her friends,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.206
I went to the one person
who could help me.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.340
Momma!

12:20.373 --> 12:22.209
I have a very important
stamp-based conundrum.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.411
Hold the Mahj, ladies.
Did you hear that?

12:24.444 --> 12:27.680
My son is a very adult,
grown-up stamp-collector.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.382
Wow, good for you.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.583
Yep, stamps are my thing,

12:30.617 --> 12:32.685
and I need to
talk about stamps
right now over here.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.022
Uh, Murray's even sharing
his incredibly rare

12:35.055 --> 12:37.257
and valuable stamp collection
with Adam.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.859
He's really taken to it.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.261
Like a stamp to a letter.
Also, private convo now.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.196
You know, stamps aren't
even really a hobby.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.432
They're more of
a sound financial investment.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.334
Dad's stamps are gone!
What?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.170
I used them on
a toy contest to get toys
'cause I want more toys.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.705
We should go.
No, stay.
He didn't mean that.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.809
Adam, tell my dear friends
that you're a mature
stamp gentleman.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.211
Who cares what
these crazy bats think?
Dad's gonna kill me.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.746
Your instincts were right.
You should go.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.817
Hello, Willow Grove Mall,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.819
or as it shall
henceforth be known,

13:05.853 --> 13:08.655
Willow Groove Mall,
am I right?

13:09.556 --> 13:11.391
Whoo!
You are right!

13:11.959 --> 13:13.426
Thank you, lone sir.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.397
I am John Calabasas
of John Calabasas
Talent Management

13:17.430 --> 13:19.399
and Mall Recording Boothness.

13:19.432 --> 13:24.104
And today we're doing a live
recording for Star Search...

13:24.137 --> 13:25.272
Audition tape.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.406
I love you, Rikki Gold!

13:26.439 --> 13:28.675
You hear that?
They love you, Rikki Gold.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.978
By the way, I am totally
diggin' that name change.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.645
Oh, it's 'cause,
you know...

13:32.679 --> 13:33.847
Yeah, I know.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.782
Ladies and gentlemen
without jobs,

13:35.815 --> 13:39.452
I give you Rikki Gold!

13:39.486 --> 13:42.822
ADULT ADAM: With that,
Rikki Gold unleashed
the best song ever...

13:42.856 --> 13:45.125
* Mama, just killed a man
...in the worst
way possible...

13:45.158 --> 13:48.495
...one person singing
a four-part harmony.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.629
* Bismillah

13:49.662 --> 13:51.331
* No, we will
not let him go

13:51.364 --> 13:52.432
* Let him go

13:52.465 --> 13:53.566
* Bismillah

13:53.600 --> 13:54.767
* Will not let him go

13:54.801 --> 13:55.835
* Let me go

13:55.869 --> 13:56.937
* Bismillah

13:56.970 --> 13:58.005
* We will not let you go

13:58.038 --> 13:59.106
* Let me go

13:59.139 --> 14:00.307
* Will not let you go
Let him go

14:00.340 --> 14:03.243
* Will not let you go
Never let you go-o-o-o-o

14:03.276 --> 14:05.645
* No, no, no
N, no, no *

14:05.678 --> 14:06.980
Uh, no.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.282
No, no, no.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.018
Uh, sorry, folks.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.352
Thanks so much
for coming out.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.453
There a problem?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.688
You're doing great.
One little note.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.424
I'm quitting
as your manager.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.292
You can't quit.
I signed the contract.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.628
This contract?

14:21.661 --> 14:24.264
Yeah.
This has been voided.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.599
Sorry, kid. Not everybody
can be Freddie Mercury.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.736
Don't tell me that now.
You're the one who told me
to ditch my best friends.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.304
Good luck with everything,

14:31.338 --> 14:32.805
except music.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.208
ADULT ADAM:
While Erica's solo career
was crumbling,

14:35.242 --> 14:38.611
me and my mom were trying to
fix my dad's stamp collection.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.048
Thanks for bailing me out
of this unforeseen accident

14:41.081 --> 14:43.283
of not winning a nation-wide
toy contest, Mama.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.651
Well, you owe me, Schmoo.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.820
I spent butt-loads replacing
every one of your father's
stupid stamps.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.390
Whoa-ho-ho.
Guess who found us

14:50.423 --> 14:54.494
a 1972
"Preserving Wetlands"
stamp?

14:54.527 --> 14:55.929
Oh, yes.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.165
Let's just put
it in the binder,
and we will be...

14:58.198 --> 14:59.666
These are not
my stamps.
BEVERLY: What?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.501
These are most certainly
your stamps.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.570
No, no, no,
my '39 Kitty Hawk

15:03.603 --> 15:05.238
had a crease in
the left-hand corner.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.407
Maybe it got un-creased
over time?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.109
You can't un-crease
a stamp crease.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.377
You don't know that
for sure.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.312
I know everything
about stamps.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.848
My first job was sorting mail
at the town post office.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.217
Ohh, balls.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.119
He's introducing
new personal history.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.588
Even though that job was
long and mind-numbing,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.657
I was happy to do it
'cause I just lost my mom.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.892
Ohh, no!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.694
I've re-opened a terrible
childhood wound.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.429
The only thing that
brought me joy that year

15:29.462 --> 15:32.299
was learning about
the colorful postage
from around the world.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.734
Oh, no, those stamps hold
a deep emotional value!

15:34.767 --> 15:36.236
Of course they do.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.870
Those stamps made me happy.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.306
I want them back.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.407
They're gone, dude.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.510
Okay, I can explain.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.512
Don't explain.
It won't help.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.946
Or will it?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.248
See, Toys "R" Us...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.551
Toys?
You ruined my stamps
over toys?

15:51.584 --> 15:52.919
Let's see how you like it.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.256
What are you doing?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.624
Ruining Adam's toy.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.959
That's Stretch Armstrong.
He's made
to be unbreakable.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.328
Ahh!

16:01.361 --> 16:03.563
Oh! Ha!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.298
I broke the red one's head.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.000
Nah, that just means
you won.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.501
Say goodbye to these.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.473
Those are Wall Crawlers.
You're just playing with them
as intended.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.575
Bevy, I told you
this would happen.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.577
I knew the moron would
screw up my favorite hobby.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.714
But you said this was just
a smart investment
and not a hobby at all.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.283
We both knew it was a hobby!

16:23.316 --> 16:25.018
My favorite hobby
in the world.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.521
Oh, God, are you...sad?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.790
Enjoy your toys.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.029
ADULT ADAM:
Erica's solo career may have
crashed and burned,

16:36.063 --> 16:38.665
but The Dropouts were about
to be on fire.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.568
Hey, best friends.
Huge news.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.903
I fired my manager,
so now I'm totally avail

16:43.936 --> 16:44.971
to get our band
back together.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.174
So, you blew it at the mall
and came crawling back

16:47.207 --> 16:48.608
'cause you're
a giant pile of failure?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.910
What? No.
It... It's like they say,

16:50.943 --> 16:53.046
the music business
is a friend business.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.648
Stop. Yesterday, I was
at the mall flirting with

16:55.682 --> 16:57.817
the totally hot manager
at Sunglass Kiosk.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.987
His name is Randy.
He wears tank tops
even though it's winter.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.590
He lives in a boat parked
in his parent's backyard.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.293
Anyway, I saw you
bomb hard.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.694
Oh, you saw that, huh?

17:07.727 --> 17:08.861
Don't listen to her, Erica.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.029
She likes a guy
named Randy.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.199
Okay, so, question...
Would you be open

17:12.232 --> 17:14.334
to the "crawling back
to grovel" option?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.636
Too late. We're about
to record our audition
for Star Search.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.238
That's right.
And we're about to make

17:18.271 --> 17:19.972
Bohemian Rhapsody
even better.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.342
How do you make the greatest
rock song in the world better?

17:22.375 --> 17:26.079
It's right there
in the title...
Bohemian Rap City.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.680
Rap City.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.982
Wait.
You think it's Rap City?

17:30.016 --> 17:32.885
Duh. How can they make a song
set in a rap city

17:32.919 --> 17:35.255
and not have one single
sick rhyme or fresh beat?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.356
Hit it!

17:36.389 --> 17:37.690
* Mama

17:37.724 --> 17:39.326
* I'm so, so sorry

17:39.359 --> 17:40.960
* Just killed a man

17:40.993 --> 17:42.729
* With the power of karate

17:42.762 --> 17:44.864
* Put a gun
against his head

17:44.897 --> 17:46.166
* And my foot

17:46.199 --> 17:48.034
* Pulled my trigger
Now he's dead

17:48.067 --> 17:49.702
* Killed him with my foot

17:49.736 --> 17:51.070
* Mama

17:51.104 --> 17:52.705
* You gave birth
to a ninja

17:52.739 --> 17:54.674
* Life had just begun

17:54.707 --> 17:56.676
* Now they're locking up
my feet

17:56.709 --> 18:00.380
* But now I've gone
and thrown it all away

18:00.413 --> 18:03.416
* Oh, I also hit him
with some nunchucks

18:03.450 --> 18:06.553
* Mama, oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
* I'm sorry that he died

18:06.586 --> 18:09.856
* I'm sorry I committed
foot homicide

18:09.889 --> 18:12.525
* Didn't mean
to make you cry

18:12.559 --> 18:13.693
* Whoops!

18:13.726 --> 18:18.198
* If I'm not back again
this time tomorrow

18:18.231 --> 18:21.634
* Carry on, carry on
* Barry's gone
Barry's gone

18:21.668 --> 18:24.837
* As if nothing really matters
* And you'll lose
the world's best rapper

18:24.871 --> 18:26.939
**

18:26.973 --> 18:28.575
* Too late

18:28.608 --> 18:30.243
* I can't unkick his face

18:30.277 --> 18:31.844
* My time has come

18:31.878 --> 18:33.546
* I'm moving to outer space

18:33.580 --> 18:37.049
* Send shivers
down my spine
* I'm also from Mars

18:37.083 --> 18:38.751
* Body's aching
all the time

18:38.785 --> 18:40.420
* I forgot to mention that

18:40.453 --> 18:42.655
* Goodbye, everybody

18:42.689 --> 18:45.392
* I'm an alien
* I've got to go

18:45.425 --> 18:47.394
* And I got
no private parts, yo!

18:47.427 --> 18:52.265
* Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth

18:52.299 --> 18:54.100
* I'll miss you, Rap City

18:54.133 --> 18:57.504
* Mama, oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
* And so I sail
past the moon

18:57.537 --> 18:58.938
* Goodbye, Rap City

18:58.971 --> 19:00.807
* Hope I see y'all soon

19:00.840 --> 19:02.409
* Blasting off to hyperspace

19:02.442 --> 19:04.211
* Maybe you can follow me

19:04.244 --> 19:07.747
* That's where
I'll be starting
my own rap colony

19:07.780 --> 19:10.950
* Chocolate milk fountains
on every street

19:10.983 --> 19:14.421
* And big golden statues
of my murderous feet

19:14.454 --> 19:17.890
* My name is Big Tasty
And I am no comedian

19:17.924 --> 19:19.592
* Just god of the universe

19:19.626 --> 19:21.294
* Also I'm Bohemian

19:21.328 --> 19:22.995
* Mmm, mmm, mmm *
Okay, I'm gonna
stop you there.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.096
What?

19:24.130 --> 19:25.532
We need you back.
Really?

19:25.565 --> 19:28.167
Well, let's be honest.
Our band needs
its Freddie Mercury.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.102
Come on, we both know
that's you.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.605
Honestly, I... I thought
it was you.

19:32.639 --> 19:36.075
Actually, I realized today
that we don't need a frontman.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.245
You know what's worse
than bombing at some mall?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.512
Having to do it alone.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.915
Well, you'll never be
alone again.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.818
ADULT ADAM: Sometimes,
you don't realize
how important something is

19:45.852 --> 19:49.789
until it's gone,
and you do whatever it takes
to find it again.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.391
Hey.
Don't.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.260
The stamps are gone.
It's over, okay?

19:53.293 --> 19:56.463
Here. I got us tickets
to the Abington Stamp Expo.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.132
I heard there's an
80th anniversary Pony Express
up for auction.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.703
Stop. You don't have to
pretend to like my dumb
hobby just for me.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.505
No.
I... I get it.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.574
Stamps are more
than just a hobby.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.342
They were a bright spot
when you were a kid.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.110
You could say that.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.581
Well, that's what all
my action figures are for me.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.384
No matter how old I am,
these toys remind me of a time

20:17.417 --> 20:20.387
when things were just easy
and fun, you know?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.823
I do know.
I really do.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.394
So, what do you say we make
some new bright spots
and go to your Stamp Expo?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.196
**

20:30.229 --> 20:32.299
Let's go get
that Pony Express.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.401
ADULT ADAM: So often, we get
carried away thinking

20:34.434 --> 20:36.669
we can do things better
on our own.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.872
The fact is, life is better
when you're part of a team.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.742
When you have people you
truly love backing you up,

20:42.775 --> 20:45.445
everything rocks harder,
sounds better,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.113
and shines brighter.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.616
* Ooh-ooh

20:49.649 --> 20:51.884
And in the end,
nothing really matters more

20:51.918 --> 20:53.753
than keeping the band
together.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.422
* Oh, yeah, oh, yeah *

20:56.723 --> 20:59.158
Ten years later...
Later...

20:59.191 --> 21:00.627
The Transformers
have been dumped

21:00.660 --> 21:02.562
on the Junk Planet
Trashatron!

21:02.595 --> 21:05.164
But look! Chewbacca and his
friends will save them.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.066
**

21:07.099 --> 21:09.702
ADAM AND REAL ADAM:
I think we should go
check it out, Hammerhead!

21:09.736 --> 21:11.771
Yes,
that would be a good idea.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.507
Oh, no,
the trash pile is collapsing!

21:14.541 --> 21:15.908
Aah!

21:16.443 --> 21:17.644
**

21:17.677 --> 21:19.746
REAL ADAM:
Stamps are our hobby.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.917
REAL ADAM: We have a wide,
wide selection
of very exotic stamps.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.486
REAL MURRAY: Stop it!
Aah!
