02:07.802 --> 02:10.429
- You got the ring?
- Of course I've got the ring.

02:10.513 --> 02:12.056
Hey, good luck.

02:12.431 --> 02:14.267
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

02:16.477 --> 02:18.271
Chief Justice, may I present...

02:18.354 --> 02:21.482
despite his outward appearance,
the happy groom?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.276
I've known Christian Harrison...

02:23.359 --> 02:26.362
since he was the embassy brat
at the Court of Saint James's.

02:26.445 --> 02:27.738
Who would have thought then...

02:27.822 --> 02:31.075
that I would have to ask his permission
to enter the Oval Office?

02:31.158 --> 02:33.953
- Steve, are you sure-
- I've got the ring.

02:34.870 --> 02:38.707
- I've already asked that, haven't I?
- Just six or eight times.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.793
All right.

03:51.321 --> 03:53.782
My friends, we are gathered here today...

03:53.865 --> 03:57.285
to join this couple
in the blessed bonds of matrimony.

03:58.703 --> 04:02.249
The marriage ceremony has long been
one of my favorite functions.

04:02.332 --> 04:05.210
I officiate at this one today
with great pleasure.

04:34.072 --> 04:35.240
Done?

04:35.323 --> 04:39.160
The homing device will start to transmit
as soon as they start the car.

04:39.244 --> 04:42.288
And we shall be there right behind them.

04:42.997 --> 04:45.750
- Who gives this woman in marriage?
- I do.

04:46.668 --> 04:49.254
And what is the token of their love?

04:50.755 --> 04:54.550
Place the ring on the third finger
of her left hand, please.

04:56.386 --> 04:59.138
Do you, Christian Harrison,
take this woman...

04:59.222 --> 05:01.391
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

05:01.474 --> 05:04.227
in sickness and in health,
for richer or poorer...

05:04.310 --> 05:06.938
- as long as you both shall live?
- I do.

05:08.106 --> 05:11.609
And do you, Diana Prince,
take this man, Christian Harrison...

05:11.692 --> 05:13.611
to be your lawfully wedded husband...

05:13.694 --> 05:16.823
in sickness and in health,
for richer or poorer...

05:16.906 --> 05:20.243
- as long as you both shall live?
- I do.

05:20.868 --> 05:25.456
Then with the powers vested in me,
I pronounce you man and wife.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.377
You may kiss the bride.

07:03.887 --> 07:06.223
- Fill it up and check it out.
- Yes, sir.

07:40.298 --> 07:43.885
Take this guy on a snipe hunt.
I'll see what I can find.

07:44.093 --> 07:45.345
Got you.

07:51.142 --> 07:54.979
You got a road map we could look at?
I think my friend here took a wrong turn.

07:55.063 --> 07:56.981
- Where you headed?
- Scottsdale.

07:57.065 --> 07:59.901
You're on the right road.
Come on, I'll show you.

08:08.576 --> 08:12.163
- I think I'll have a cheeseburger.
- They are very good.

08:12.246 --> 08:13.289
Thank you.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.460
I've changed my mind.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.962
From "I do" to "I don't"?

08:21.506 --> 08:24.425
No. From a cheeseburger
to a chocolate soda.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.429
Cheeseburgers can stand rejection
better than I.

08:28.512 --> 08:30.056
What are you going to have?

09:01.837 --> 09:03.839
How is your cheeseburger?

09:05.758 --> 09:07.259
Very strange.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.728
Chris, I'd like to freshen up a little bit.

09:19.021 --> 09:22.066
Don't be too long. We want to get
to the Hacienda before dark.

09:22.149 --> 09:23.317
Right.

10:01.813 --> 10:04.274
Shopping for a honeymoon negligÃ©e?

10:09.196 --> 10:10.947
What are you after?

10:22.918 --> 10:24.127
Johnny!

11:46.042 --> 11:47.335
You okay?

11:49.587 --> 11:52.089
- Thank you, Wonder Woman.
- You're welcome.

11:52.173 --> 11:53.841
"Thank you, Wonder Woman"?

11:53.924 --> 11:57.178
- Don't you have a bride somewhere?
- Yes, but-

11:57.261 --> 11:59.764
- Shouldn't you be looking after her?
- Yes. Certainly.

11:59.847 --> 12:01.599
This is no way to spend your honeymoon.

12:01.682 --> 12:03.225
- No.
- No.

12:03.559 --> 12:05.477
I couldn't agree more.

12:06.103 --> 12:08.439
All right. Who's going to pay for all of this?

12:08.522 --> 12:11.233
I've got a boss who'll be pretty mad
when he gets back.

12:11.317 --> 12:13.402
And I have a credit card.

12:15.696 --> 12:18.240
How am I supposed to write this up?

12:18.324 --> 12:21.285
You've got me, pal. If you'd just...

12:35.090 --> 12:36.300
Diana.

12:37.092 --> 12:38.552
Chris, what happened to you?

12:38.635 --> 12:42.055
- Listen, you're not going to believe this.
- Try me.

12:42.639 --> 12:45.309
- There was this girl.
- On my honeymoon?

12:45.392 --> 12:48.103
It's not like that. Honest.

12:52.566 --> 12:55.402
Diana, did you pack a bathing suit?

12:56.320 --> 12:59.072
I think this health spa
you've chosen for our honeymoon...

12:59.156 --> 13:02.993
is gonna do you a lot of good.
Yes, I packed a bathing suit.

13:03.076 --> 13:06.663
This girl was wearing a bathing suit
that looked like...

13:14.421 --> 13:16.631
Let me put it to you this way:

13:17.382 --> 13:20.260
I have seen Wonder Woman.

13:22.095 --> 13:23.597
Wonder Woman?

13:23.680 --> 13:26.474
Miss, could I have
another American flag...

13:27.434 --> 13:29.269
Cheeseburger, please.

13:30.437 --> 13:34.899
- Are you going to be all right?
- To tell the truth, I'm not really sure.

13:49.998 --> 13:53.042
You better get ready
to get back to Switzerland.

13:53.126 --> 13:55.837
- How much is there?
- With the laundered pesos...

13:55.920 --> 13:58.298
I guess we've got $200,000.

13:59.299 --> 14:00.592
Not bad.

14:00.842 --> 14:03.052
I want you to leave in a couple of days.

14:03.136 --> 14:06.639
I'll give you the bank account number
for deposit.

14:06.723 --> 14:09.475
Yes. Thank you.

14:09.851 --> 14:12.603
Do me a favor, would you?
Send Johnny and Smitty in.

14:12.687 --> 14:14.355
I will, Mr. Allen.

14:18.151 --> 14:19.986
Boss wants to see you.

14:28.995 --> 14:32.540
- Let me explain, Mr. Allen-
- I'm not interested in any excuses.

14:32.623 --> 14:36.169
The fact remains that you can provide
no additional information than...

14:36.252 --> 14:40.172
I gave you when I asked you to follow
those people and search their belongings.

14:40.256 --> 14:43.134
Come on.
I mean, there was this really weird girl.

14:43.217 --> 14:46.470
- She was incredibly strong. I've never-
- Don't you read the papers?

14:46.554 --> 14:47.680
I read the papers.

14:47.763 --> 14:51.267
The girl he described is Wonder Woman.
You understand?

14:52.101 --> 14:54.520
She frequently helps the IADC.

14:54.603 --> 14:59.400
And Christian Harrison has just married
one of that agency's top operatives.

15:00.359 --> 15:02.194
What I'm going to do...

15:02.278 --> 15:06.198
is use that love play
as an intelligence ploy.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.259
We have a reservation.
Mr. and Mrs. Christian Harrison.

16:07.342 --> 16:11.680
Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.
The Honeymoon Suite is ready for you.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.265
Thank you.

16:13.432 --> 16:16.518
May I offer the Hacienda's wishes
for a pleasant stay with us...

16:16.601 --> 16:18.437
as well as a long and happy marriage?

16:18.520 --> 16:22.274
- Of course you may.
- That's very sweet. Thank you very much.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.568
Suite 100.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.654
Shall we?

16:38.373 --> 16:40.292
This is pretty.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.461
Great.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.217
Thank you.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.975
I wonder if all brides feel
as uncomfortable as I do...

16:57.058 --> 16:59.561
when all of a sudden
they find themselves alone...

16:59.644 --> 17:02.230
with this very strange person
that they have married?

17:02.313 --> 17:05.567
That's why I took the last three
to an amusement park.

17:05.650 --> 17:09.654
When I got embarrassed,
I could always go on the merry-go-round.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.790
"Always. "

17:23.917 --> 17:26.337
A sentiment devoutly to be wished.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.679
Wine?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.892
Someone's at the door.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.604
- Saved by the knock.
- This time.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.944
Sam.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.739
- Hello, Chris.
- Sam Tucker. Come on in.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.413
May I present my bride, Diana Harrison?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.291
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you, sir.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.751
When did you get married?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.879
We just went through
a very well-publicized wedding ceremony.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.297
Don't you read the papers?

18:10.381 --> 18:13.884
I'm afraid we missed the publicity
out here on the frontier.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.346
Some frontier.
I should be honest with you.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.057
Hold on. Let me go turn on the radio.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.026
Okay. I think it is safe to talk now.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.278
We're not really married.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.990
This is Diana Prince of the IADC.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.118
And this is all part of a plan.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.079
And you set this up
because of what I told Joe Atkinson?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.247
Exactly.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.708
And you've surrounded this place
and you'll arrest all the employees?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.710
That's not the way
it's going to come down.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.505
Perhaps you'd better listen
to the little woman.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.091
I really think we ought to start...

18:54.174 --> 18:57.511
with some details
that Sam has told Joe Atkinson.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.264
Sam?

19:02.349 --> 19:04.601
Of course, I made several phone calls.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.523
The first was when I opened negotiations
for a South American trade agreement.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.692
- Coffee time.
- That's right.

19:11.775 --> 19:15.445
The lobbyists knew more about
what our posture would be than I did.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.615
The IADC started checking
into possible leaks right then.

19:18.698 --> 19:19.991
And we came up empty.

19:20.075 --> 19:24.079
The next call was made after the debacle
with the Middle Eastern oil cartel.

19:24.162 --> 19:27.707
Their entire delegation walked
after I made my opening speech.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.461
That's when I put out the directive
on loose talk at cocktail parties.

19:31.545 --> 19:36.258
Then Dolly and I had an intimate supper
with the Canal countries...

19:36.341 --> 19:38.677
in which we reached
what was considered...

19:38.760 --> 19:42.806
an unofficial solution,
a blueprint for a forthcoming agreement.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.142
The next morning I couldn't get anyone
to answer a phone call.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.646
I'm sorry, Sam, we had no idea
this would trace back to your wife.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.190
Dolly was simply one
of many important wives...

19:52.273 --> 19:55.276
who are currently leaking
vital trade information.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.197
We figured that the wife of someone
with an important White House position...

19:59.280 --> 20:01.324
would be a prime target.
So we got married.

20:01.407 --> 20:03.535
We're dealing
with a very clever fellow here.

20:03.618 --> 20:07.622
He's been bleeding information out of his
important female guests for some time.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.834
Selling it to the highest bidder
and acquiring a tidy fortune in the process.

20:11.918 --> 20:13.127
But who?

20:13.211 --> 20:15.421
Who is he? Who's behind this?

20:15.838 --> 20:17.799
It's David Allen, sir.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.344
All of our leads end up right here
at the Hacienda.

20:21.594 --> 20:24.722
- Dolly is here with you?
- She insisted I come.

20:25.014 --> 20:27.266
She said she wanted
to put our marriage together.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.727
I didn't even know it had fallen apart.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.606
Maybe we can help both of you.
Will I have any trouble finding her?

20:33.689 --> 20:36.609
I hope you won't have
as much difficulty as I do.

20:36.692 --> 20:39.487
She seems to takes more massages
than Muhammad Ali.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.712
David, how good of you to come.

20:58.130 --> 21:00.174
You recognized my touch?

21:00.257 --> 21:03.844
Of course. After all, how many years
have I been coming here?

21:03.928 --> 21:08.265
I don't know for sure, but it seems
like forever since your last visit.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.310
You are tense.

21:12.728 --> 21:16.524
Don't tell me you're letting all
those Washington pressures get to you?

21:16.607 --> 21:18.484
No more than usual.

21:18.984 --> 21:21.862
- Sam is here, you know.
- I read about that.

21:22.738 --> 21:25.324
Guess you've been entertaining a lot?

21:25.407 --> 21:29.411
You know I'm the hostess for the A list.
Of course I've been entertaining.

21:33.207 --> 21:36.627
- Feel good?
- Wonderful.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.212
There we are.

21:39.421 --> 21:44.093
Why don't you just... relax?

22:08.075 --> 22:10.702
I had no idea that out here
in peaceful Scottsdale...

22:10.786 --> 22:13.830
someone was just waiting for me
to get married.

22:14.915 --> 22:17.918
It hadn't even occurred to me
until I met you.

22:18.001 --> 22:20.337
Let's not get carried away, Chris.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.422
They know that you have
the President's ear.

22:22.506 --> 22:24.883
And chances are they know
how I make a living, too.

22:24.966 --> 22:27.260
This is not what they call a shoo-in.

22:27.344 --> 22:28.929
So how do we cross the wire?

22:29.012 --> 22:32.307
I don't know about you, but I'm going
to start with a swim. Join me?

22:32.390 --> 22:35.936
No, I'm beat from the drive.
You go ahead. Do you mind?

22:36.019 --> 22:38.980
- No, as long as you watch me.
- How could I not?

23:08.551 --> 23:11.429
Now, Dolly darling, I want you to tell me...

23:11.513 --> 23:16.226
everything about that party
you gave for those pipeline people.

23:17.810 --> 23:19.896
"Another cocktail, Mr. Secretary?"

23:19.979 --> 23:22.482
"No, thank you, Dolly darling.

23:22.607 --> 23:25.568
"I have to keep a clear head
for this evening. "

23:26.069 --> 23:29.989
"I am so sorry, Olin.
I made them especially for you.

23:30.073 --> 23:32.742
"Come on, you've still got a few minutes. "

23:33.910 --> 23:36.746
"Thank you, Dolly.
You've twisted my arm. "

23:37.705 --> 23:41.918
If you don't mind, Dolly darling,
we'll just lose those few minutes.

23:42.877 --> 23:46.130
You should be serving
your port and cigars by now.

23:46.255 --> 23:48.883
May I hear it, please?

23:50.760 --> 23:54.597
"We need much more money...

23:54.680 --> 23:56.724
"to finish the pipeline.

23:58.267 --> 24:01.270
"Of course, if the unions find out
the hole we're in...

24:01.354 --> 24:04.065
"the costs are going to be astronomical.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.776
"Thank you, Dolly darling.

24:08.569 --> 24:11.113
"These aren't from Cuba, are they?"

24:13.574 --> 24:18.162
Thank you, Dolly Blabbermouth.

24:23.209 --> 24:26.629
I'm sorry, David.
Forgive me, I must have dropped off.

24:28.005 --> 24:30.716
I didn't talk in my sleep, did I?

24:30.799 --> 24:32.468
No, of course not.

24:32.551 --> 24:35.596
And if you did,
I certainly would not repeat it.

24:35.679 --> 24:37.389
Of course you wouldn't.

24:37.473 --> 24:40.684
Imagine the position you'd be in
if you could repeat...

24:40.768 --> 24:45.564
all the things that the Washington wives
pick up just by osmosis?

24:45.939 --> 24:49.610
Well, Dolly, I don't listen.

24:49.693 --> 24:53.363
No, of course you don't.

25:26.813 --> 25:28.940
Hi, I'm Denny Lake.

25:31.151 --> 25:34.154
I'm Chris Harrison. My wife, Diana.

25:34.613 --> 25:36.448
How do you do?

25:36.948 --> 25:40.243
As the tennis pro here,
I'm supposed to encourage the guests.

25:40.327 --> 25:42.787
- Do you play?
- No, I've never had the time.

25:42.871 --> 25:44.498
I play a little.

25:44.581 --> 25:48.001
I'm not exactly a Tracy or a Chrissy,
but I try.

25:48.460 --> 25:51.630
All right. Take this racket.
Maybe we can make one out of you.

25:51.713 --> 25:53.924
- Okay.
- All right with you, Mr. Harrison?

25:54.007 --> 25:55.216
Why not?

25:55.717 --> 25:59.179
I'd like to go take a nap.
Maybe a round of golf or something.

25:59.262 --> 26:01.014
- Okay.
- Bye, darling.

26:01.639 --> 26:03.099
Hey, Johnny.

26:07.187 --> 26:10.440
Johnny, this is Mrs. Harrison.
Mrs. Harrison, Johnny.

26:10.523 --> 26:14.277
Would you take Mrs. Harrison out and
give her some pointers on center court?

26:14.360 --> 26:15.653
Sure. Come with me.

26:17.822 --> 26:20.909
Lean into the ball.
Keep your right arm straight.

26:21.868 --> 26:23.453
Remember shoulder rotation.

26:31.711 --> 26:34.422
Keep your weight forward.
Shoulder rotation.

26:36.674 --> 26:39.135
That's it, keep on top of the ball.

26:41.137 --> 26:44.599
Keep your right arm straight.
Lean forward. That's it.

26:46.559 --> 26:49.187
Put your weight behind you. That's it.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.193
Nice try.

26:59.238 --> 27:00.907
That was fun. Thank you.

27:00.990 --> 27:04.076
- Listen, you could really be good.
- Right.

27:04.410 --> 27:06.787
Anytime you want to practice,
just come on by.

27:06.871 --> 27:10.791
You can use the ball machine.
It will really keep you in shape.

27:11.417 --> 27:14.211
Thank you very much again. Johnny.

27:15.421 --> 27:17.340
- Mrs. Harrison?
- Yes.

27:17.423 --> 27:21.010
I think you better take a steam.
You're gonna be sore.

27:22.219 --> 27:25.598
You're right there. I could sure use one.
My arm's a little sore.

27:25.681 --> 27:27.433
It's right up there.

27:31.061 --> 27:32.688
Okay. Thanks again.

27:35.649 --> 27:39.153
Her husband went on to their suite,
and we played for a while.

27:39.236 --> 27:40.738
She's not bad.

27:41.113 --> 27:43.657
I'm not interested
in her tennis prowess, you idiot.

27:43.741 --> 27:46.619
- Where is she right now?
- Taking a steam, I guess.

27:46.702 --> 27:48.912
She's married
to the President's right arm...

27:48.996 --> 27:51.707
and you guess
that she's taking a steam bath?

27:52.875 --> 27:55.711
Why am I surrounded
by such incompetence?

28:01.133 --> 28:03.343
Hello, this is David. Yes.

28:04.011 --> 28:08.307
Could you please see that Mrs. Harrison
gets the Hacienda special steam?

29:10.702 --> 29:14.164
Tell me, David. Exactly how long
have I been coming here?

29:14.247 --> 29:16.207
Why, Dolly, you know as well as I...

29:16.291 --> 29:18.918
that you were among
the first patrons of the Hacienda.

29:19.002 --> 29:20.336
Were it not for you...

29:20.420 --> 29:23.089
- Please, David, spare me that.
- But it's true, Dolly.

29:23.298 --> 29:25.175
You know as well as I...

29:25.258 --> 29:28.178
that everyone who is anyone knows...

29:28.261 --> 29:31.723
that Dolly Tucker is the one
who decides what is in.

29:32.432 --> 29:36.477
Where to dine. What to wear.
Where to go, to shop.

29:37.103 --> 29:40.732
You are a trendsetter, lady. Let's face it.

29:41.232 --> 29:43.318
Without you I'd be running a desert.

29:43.401 --> 29:46.029
All of this would be nothing but a mirage.

29:46.112 --> 29:48.239
David, you are running a mirage.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.033
But of course.

29:50.533 --> 29:53.035
This mirage,
thanks to you, has become real.

29:53.286 --> 29:56.080
These ladies, do you know
that many of them who visit us...

29:56.164 --> 29:58.040
come because of you?

29:58.124 --> 30:00.585
Oh, yeah, it certainly benefits them.

30:00.668 --> 30:04.672
They're trimmer, more vivacious,
better hostesses.

30:05.047 --> 30:08.092
And I've even been told
they are better wives.

30:10.136 --> 30:11.637
Better listeners?

30:13.681 --> 30:15.141
Yes, I suppose.

30:15.891 --> 30:17.893
Take you for instance, look at you.

30:17.977 --> 30:20.438
I'll bet you anything
that very soon in the market...

30:20.521 --> 30:23.858
- there's gonna be a Dolly Tucker doll.
- There already is one.

30:24.150 --> 30:27.570
Every wife of every important
Washington official here...

30:27.653 --> 30:28.946
is a doll.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.531
We walk.

30:30.614 --> 30:33.617
We talk. We entertain. We serve.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.120
We listen. Mostly we listen.

30:36.328 --> 30:37.746
But when we talk...

30:37.830 --> 30:41.125
it is to the wonderfully
receptive David Allen.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.626
Dolly darling.

30:42.710 --> 30:46.797
Don't you "Dolly darling" me.
You have made human tape recorders...

30:46.922 --> 30:49.133
of every important wife here.

30:49.216 --> 30:51.677
Every single one
who's had one of your massages.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.764
If I hadn't fallen from a horse last week,
I would never have known it.

30:56.181 --> 30:58.684
- Last week?
- Early last week.

30:59.309 --> 31:02.646
About the time I gave you the information
about the coffee cartel.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.314
- Dolly, please-
- Don't interrupt me.

31:04.398 --> 31:06.233
- Listen I-
- It's very rude.

31:07.192 --> 31:10.154
After my accident,
I went to a chiropractor.

31:10.487 --> 31:12.990
He realigned the nerves in my spine.

31:13.157 --> 31:17.578
After that, when you touched my button,
it had no effect.

31:17.995 --> 31:20.497
So the information I gave you
this afternoon...

31:20.581 --> 31:23.125
was as phony as David Allen.

31:24.001 --> 31:27.754
- Well, that's very interesting, Dolly.
- I thought so, too, David.

31:27.838 --> 31:31.008
You've been making traitors of us all
for some time.

31:31.174 --> 31:33.552
The only way I could feign
that recorded bit...

31:33.635 --> 31:36.304
was because you had me doing it
for so long.

31:36.471 --> 31:37.931
Well, Dolly...

31:38.932 --> 31:42.394
I suppose our relationship has ended,
wouldn't you say?

31:42.894 --> 31:45.188
Unless, of course,
there's something you want...

31:45.272 --> 31:47.524
for the information you now possess.

31:48.233 --> 31:49.776
You know something?

31:50.026 --> 31:52.654
Ever since I can remember,
I've hated horses.

31:53.822 --> 31:55.198
All right, Dolly.

31:56.283 --> 31:57.617
What do you want?

31:59.411 --> 32:01.121
I want my husband back.

32:01.788 --> 32:04.708
I'm tired of the merry-go-round.

32:08.086 --> 32:12.424
I'm willing to take a chance on
Sam being discredited in the government.

32:13.091 --> 32:15.010
I want him to resign...

32:15.802 --> 32:18.722
and I want no opposition
to his resignation.

32:21.015 --> 32:24.269
I just want to go home to New Jersey
and raise our kids.

32:25.103 --> 32:26.896
I'm sick...

32:28.148 --> 32:30.733
of the Washington rat race
on Embassy Row.

32:32.610 --> 32:35.238
You know something, Dolly?
You are a very foolish lady.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.739
- Why?
- Yes.

32:36.990 --> 32:39.659
Why didn't you simply feed me
anything you wanted?

32:39.742 --> 32:41.828
I had no idea at all...

32:41.911 --> 32:45.373
that you were no longer under my spell,
as it were.

32:45.456 --> 32:49.711
Because I want you
to cease and desist. Forever.

32:52.964 --> 32:54.132
Excuse me.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.430
Yes, David Allen here.

33:00.513 --> 33:03.683
Mr. Allen, it seems Mrs. Harrison
will be coming to any minute.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.977
Excellent. I'll be right over.

33:06.269 --> 33:08.437
Listen, we could take care
of her right now.

33:08.521 --> 33:10.022
No, you fool!

33:13.901 --> 33:15.319
Well, Dolly.

33:16.654 --> 33:19.824
It's obvious you've given a great deal
of thought to this matter.

33:19.907 --> 33:21.033
I have.

33:21.409 --> 33:24.912
I hope that you extend
the same privilege to me.

33:25.830 --> 33:29.083
Let me get this straight:
You merely want to discredit Sam?

33:29.333 --> 33:31.377
You mean for the children's sake?

33:31.460 --> 33:34.046
- Not disgraced.
- No, of course not.

33:34.130 --> 33:35.297
All right.

33:36.549 --> 33:38.050
We can talk again?

33:38.134 --> 33:41.095
- Yes. But soon.
- Of course.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.181
You know, Dolly...

33:45.099 --> 33:48.310
if only you would let me work this out...

33:49.019 --> 33:50.437
my way...

33:51.605 --> 33:53.941
we both can get what we want.

33:55.025 --> 33:59.405
You know, I'm probably as fond
of the Hacienda as you are of Sam.

34:01.949 --> 34:04.076
I love my husband a great deal.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.203
But I want him home.

34:07.955 --> 34:11.208
Have you told this to anyone?

34:11.792 --> 34:14.962
No, David.
This is just between you and me.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.135
You are one gracious lady.

34:37.859 --> 34:40.904
Hello? Yeah, this is David Allen.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.574
Listen, Mrs. Tucker should be
arriving there any minute...

34:44.658 --> 34:46.784
for her usual morning ride.

34:48.703 --> 34:51.706
I want you to make sure
that she mounts Satan.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.545
You heard me.
I'll be at the massage parlor.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.888
Satan. You be a good boy.

35:07.681 --> 35:10.725
Lovely Mrs. Tucker
is going to give you some exercise.

35:14.104 --> 35:16.231
Just let me fix your saddle.

35:54.435 --> 35:55.770
Mrs. Harrison?

35:57.438 --> 35:59.357
Are you awake, Mrs. Harrison?

36:00.900 --> 36:02.944
I hope you had a nice nap, Mrs. Harrison.

36:03.027 --> 36:06.114
Who are you? Where am I?

36:06.197 --> 36:08.407
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

36:08.574 --> 36:11.160
I'm your very concerned host.
My name is David Allen...

36:11.244 --> 36:14.038
and you are safely
in one of our massage parlors.

36:16.332 --> 36:20.044
The last I remember, I was taking a sauna.

36:20.753 --> 36:23.422
I'm afraid it's not a unique experience,
Mrs. Harrison.

36:23.506 --> 36:24.715
See what happened was...

36:24.799 --> 36:27.385
you played tennis strenuously,
took a sauna...

36:27.468 --> 36:29.303
and merely passed out from the exertion.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.807
- I'm sorry.
- You'll be all right in a few minutes.

36:34.558 --> 36:36.644
I'm so sleepy, I...

36:36.811 --> 36:40.648
- My husband.
- Please, it's all right.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.776
As a matter of fact,
your husband isn't aware of this incident.

36:43.859 --> 36:47.655
You know, he's actually playing golf
with Mr. Tucker at this very moment.

36:47.738 --> 36:50.241
So why don't you just lie back?

36:50.449 --> 36:52.660
- Sorry, I'm just so sleepy.
- It's okay.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.246
- I can't seem to keep my eyes open.
- There you go.

36:55.329 --> 36:57.289
Just take it easy.

36:57.957 --> 37:00.584
I'll make you feel like a million in a jiffy.

37:10.969 --> 37:12.888
Just take the regular bridle path.

37:12.971 --> 37:15.349
- Have a nice ride.
- I'm sure I will.

37:15.432 --> 37:17.643
Is this a new horse? What's his name?

37:18.185 --> 37:19.603
Angel.

37:53.845 --> 37:57.057
What is your name? Your real name.

37:59.851 --> 38:01.770
Diana Prince.

38:02.312 --> 38:05.148
And, of course,
you are not married, are you?

38:05.649 --> 38:07.901
Oh, but I am.

38:10.237 --> 38:13.406
Diana Prince is my maiden name.
My married name is...

38:14.241 --> 38:16.493
Mrs. Christian Harrison.

38:17.369 --> 38:20.830
Mrs. Harrison, what is your job?

38:22.123 --> 38:25.335
I am an agent with the IADC.

38:26.002 --> 38:28.254
Exactly what is your assignment?

38:30.048 --> 38:32.092
My assignment?

38:34.761 --> 38:37.430
It's written in the marriage contract.

38:37.514 --> 38:38.640
What?

38:39.974 --> 38:44.687
- "To love and to honor... "
- No, I mean what are you doing here?

38:46.189 --> 38:47.899
I'm on my honeymoon.

38:48.942 --> 38:50.568
For no other purpose?

38:55.657 --> 38:57.033
Go ahead.

38:57.575 --> 39:00.328
- I want to...
- Yes?

39:01.371 --> 39:03.623
...brush up on my tennis.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.378
Just rest, Diana.

39:09.837 --> 39:12.173
You'll awake in a few moments...

39:12.799 --> 39:15.468
and you'll remember absolutely nothing.

39:31.525 --> 39:34.278
I've got a very busy day
planned for you two.

39:34.362 --> 39:36.322
Mrs. Tucker has caused me to take...

39:36.405 --> 39:38.491
drastic plans against Mr. Tucker.

39:38.741 --> 39:40.201
What about Harrison?

39:40.284 --> 39:43.579
I have a hunch that Harrison
will be a little hot to handle as well.

39:43.662 --> 39:45.873
Why don't you let us
get out to the golf course?

39:45.956 --> 39:48.667
Good, but first let me tell you
about the arrangements...

39:48.751 --> 39:50.586
for Dolly Tucker's canter.

39:51.295 --> 39:54.298
I've had this horse trained
to buck and rear upon signal...

39:54.381 --> 39:57.259
and will continue to do so
unless otherwise signaled.

39:57.343 --> 39:59.470
In other words, it seems highly unlikely...

39:59.553 --> 40:02.223
even an experienced rider will escape.

40:03.432 --> 40:05.726
I guess what I'm talking about is that...

40:05.809 --> 40:09.521
Dolly Tucker will attend
her very own going-away party.

40:15.277 --> 40:18.781
Mrs. Harrison, you're leaving so soon.

40:18.864 --> 40:22.743
Take my word for it, sunbathing will
make a new woman out of you.

40:22.910 --> 40:26.121
I really should be joining my husband-

40:26.205 --> 40:28.081
But tennis is your game, love.

40:28.165 --> 40:32.419
Mr. Harrison is on the golf course.
Why don't you rest a tiny moment?

40:32.836 --> 40:34.046
Please?

40:42.763 --> 40:45.432
I hope you don't play that way
at Camp David.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.726
They may not invite you back.

40:48.352 --> 40:50.270
Considering the new lady in my life...

40:50.354 --> 40:54.316
I think I'd like to take a few weekends
off golf to pursue Diana.

41:00.447 --> 41:03.825
They should play through rather quickly
when I press this.

41:08.455 --> 41:10.123
Anybody ever clocked that golf cart?

41:10.207 --> 41:13.710
Once it gets moving,
we could enter it in a stock-car race.

41:14.377 --> 41:16.338
That's the finish line over there.

41:16.421 --> 41:18.632
"Finish" is the exact word.

41:29.517 --> 41:31.603
Well, anyway, as I was saying...

42:51.432 --> 42:53.768
Well, how did you enjoy your golf game?

42:53.851 --> 42:56.187
I've been in the rough before,
but this is crazy.

42:56.270 --> 42:58.397
Mr. Tucker, where does
your wife usually ride?

42:58.481 --> 43:00.441
She usually rides over at the bridle path.

43:00.524 --> 43:01.859
Is Dolly in danger?

43:01.942 --> 43:03.736
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

43:03.819 --> 43:07.907
Chris, call Joe Atkinson and have him
order some men to close in on this place.

43:07.990 --> 43:09.241
Where's Diana?

43:09.325 --> 43:12.119
Right now she should be
in the swim of things.

43:13.120 --> 43:16.457
Y'all make sure you show up
at the tennis tournament this afternoon.

43:17.374 --> 43:18.667
See you later, babe.

44:54.470 --> 44:57.390
There is no need
to be frightened anymore, Mrs. Tucker.

44:57.473 --> 45:00.351
I've been riding horses all my life,
I love horses.

45:00.435 --> 45:03.354
But you are not going to get me
onboard that one again.

45:03.438 --> 45:06.024
Don't be silly. This is not a mean horse.

45:07.233 --> 45:08.359
Look.

45:11.821 --> 45:14.032
An evil man planned to kill you with that.

45:14.115 --> 45:15.366
Yes.

45:15.616 --> 45:18.536
I found out about him. I know who it is.

45:18.661 --> 45:20.079
I know who he is, too.

45:29.380 --> 45:31.382
Take it nice and easy.

45:33.634 --> 45:35.386
Planning a trip, Mr. Allen?

45:35.469 --> 45:37.471
Well, Wonder Woman.

45:37.555 --> 45:39.599
Your pictures don't do you justice.

45:39.682 --> 45:41.517
I can do without your flattery.

45:41.601 --> 45:42.893
Stop right there...

45:42.977 --> 45:46.522
otherwise I might go "boom"
and this man's gonna get hurt.

45:46.605 --> 45:49.275
And ultimately, I suppose,
your government.

45:49.859 --> 45:52.111
So just get out of my way, all right?

45:57.950 --> 45:59.618
I thought you were on your honeymoon.

45:59.702 --> 46:02.663
I've heard of the rocky road to love,
but this is ridiculous.

46:02.746 --> 46:04.415
I'd say you were a born bachelor.

46:09.336 --> 46:11.922
I called the kids today.
They'll meet us at the plane.

46:12.006 --> 46:13.382
That'll be great.

46:14.008 --> 46:16.260
Incidentally, I made a call today, too.

46:16.343 --> 46:17.720
- Did you?
- Yeah.

46:17.803 --> 46:20.097
My secretary will be cleaning out my desk.

46:20.180 --> 46:22.599
I dictated a letter of resignation.

46:22.683 --> 46:25.102
- Accepted?
- Reluctantly.

46:25.227 --> 46:27.521
Of course. Who'd want to lose you?

46:27.604 --> 46:30.441
- I know I don't.
- You couldn't if you tried.

46:33.986 --> 46:37.114
- I love you.
- I can't imagine why.

46:37.698 --> 46:40.033
I certainly can't imagine life without you.

46:40.117 --> 46:43.120
Which I suppose is
my bureaucratic way of saying...

46:43.996 --> 46:45.622
I love you, too.

46:46.957 --> 46:50.502
You are an absolute, lovable caution.

47:01.305 --> 47:04.266
You know, we seldom take on
married agents.

47:04.933 --> 47:06.393
Policy, you know.

47:06.852 --> 47:09.980
Outside of that, how does Chris stack up
for the IADC?

47:11.398 --> 47:14.651
- Not bad, considering...
- Considering what?

47:14.901 --> 47:16.903
Considering you left with me...

47:16.987 --> 47:19.531
on our honeymoon
and ended up with Wonder Woman.

47:19.698 --> 47:21.283
I'd say you're fickle.

48:04.784 --> 48:06.035
