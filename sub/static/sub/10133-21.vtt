17:55.783 --> 17:57.618
with Kimmy's mom

17:55.783 --> 17:57.618
to prove she's innocent.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.788
Oh, great, now she sneaks out

17:57.660 --> 18:00.788
of the house without telling us?

18:00.830 --> 18:02.582
What is going on with her?

18:02.623 --> 18:04.042
Look, you guys,

18:02.623 --> 18:04.042
I'll handle everything here.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.919
- Go ahead, take off.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.919
- Thanks, Joey.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.795
Bye, dad.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.090
I'll see you

18:08.880 --> 18:11.090
at school tomorrow. Bye.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
D.J., you missed everything.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.763
Kevin and Paul and Sam

18:14.468 --> 18:16.763
got caught drinking.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.181
They're gonna be suspended

18:16.804 --> 18:19.181
from school.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.935
I hate to say it,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.935
but they deserve it.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.271
Your mom's waiting outside.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.271
I have to find Kevin.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.607
He's over there waiting

18:25.312 --> 18:27.607
for his parents.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.067
You better talk to him now.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.485
You may not see him

18:29.108 --> 18:31.485
for a long time.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.576
- Hi.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.286
You and I have to talk.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.956
My family thinks I was drinking.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.331
Oh, man.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.709
You gotta tell my dad

18:44.373 --> 18:46.709
I'm innocent.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.212
Why did you have to go

18:48.168 --> 18:50.212
and drink, anyway?

18:51.422 --> 18:54.050
Those guys said

18:51.422 --> 18:54.050
it would loosen me up.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.886
I thought you'd have

18:54.092 --> 18:56.886
more fun with me.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.513
Well, I didn't have fun

18:56.928 --> 18:59.513
with you tonight.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.808
I had fun with the old Kevin.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.563
Kevin, your parents are here.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.816
I'm dead.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.234
D.J., I'm really sorry.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.988
I know you are.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.411
Is it okay

19:19.158 --> 19:22.411
if I call you again sometime?

19:22.453 --> 19:26.165
Alright, just make sure

19:22.453 --> 19:26.165
the old Kevin calls.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.376
Come on, son. Let's go.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.757
Kevin, have you seen D.J.?

19:34.799 --> 19:36.592
- Yeah. She's in there.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.592
- Thanks.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.303
- Uh, Mr. Tanner?

19:36.634 --> 19:39.303
- Yeah?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.932
D.J. wasn't drinking tonight.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.934
It was me and two other guys.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.937
She was trying to stop us.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.983
She was telling us the truth.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.530
I'm sorry, man. I-I saw her

19:54.986 --> 19:57.530
with the beer, I just--

19:57.571 --> 19:59.448
Oh, no, Jess, don't feel bad.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.200
It was an honest mistake.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.121
Thanks for telling us, Kevin.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.664
Come on, Kevin.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.624
Come on, let's go.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.877
I was pretty rough on her.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.296
Do you mind if I go in

20:10.918 --> 20:14.296
and have a word alone with D.J.?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.506
Okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.014
Hi.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.642
Oh, great.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.642
Now I'm in even more trouble.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.978
Look, I came down here

20:26.684 --> 20:28.978
to find Kevin so that--

20:29.020 --> 20:31.189
I just talked to Kevin outside.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.524
- You did?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.524
- Yeah.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.113
He told me what really happened.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.951
I owe you a big apology.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.995
You really hurt my feelings.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.083
I'm sorry

20:47.830 --> 20:50.083
for not believing you, pal.

20:52.292 --> 20:55.629
Well, I guess

20:52.292 --> 20:55.629
it did look kind of bad.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.925
And I did bend the truth

20:55.671 --> 20:58.925
a couple times this week.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.013
D.J., I want you to know

21:01.010 --> 21:04.013
why I lost my temper tonight.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.143
It just, it made me crazy

21:06.724 --> 21:09.143
thinking of my little niece

21:09.185 --> 21:11.145
out there starting to drink.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.855
I mean, this isn't fun

21:11.187 --> 21:12.855
and games, you know, I've seen

21:12.897 --> 21:14.148
it happen to my friends,

21:12.897 --> 21:14.148
they think they have it

21:14.190 --> 21:15.691
in their control,

21:14.190 --> 21:15.691
before they know it

21:15.733 --> 21:17.484
they'd messed up

21:15.733 --> 21:17.484
their whole lives.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.529
That's why I'm so proud of you

21:20.571 --> 21:22.281
for making

21:20.571 --> 21:22.281
the right decision tonight.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.368
It's not that hard to say no.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.247
Those kids

21:26.410 --> 21:29.247
were acting like idiots.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.040
Well..

21:31.082 --> 21:33.000
...we made it

21:31.082 --> 21:33.000
through tonight.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.629
The sad truth

21:34.627 --> 21:36.629
is that you're gonna be faced

21:36.670 --> 21:39.381
with a lot

21:36.670 --> 21:39.381
of tough decisions in your life.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.759
And not just about drinking,

21:39.423 --> 21:41.759
either, about..

21:41.801 --> 21:43.803
About drugs, and about sex..

21:43.844 --> 21:46.680
...and...who knows what.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.016
[dramatic music]

21:49.058 --> 21:50.977
I just wish

21:49.058 --> 21:50.977
you could grow up in a world

21:51.018 --> 21:53.062
where you can enjoy

21:51.018 --> 21:53.062
being a kid.

21:53.104 --> 21:57.024
But I'm sorry, pal,

21:53.104 --> 21:57.024
that's not the way it is.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.944
So...I hope that

21:57.066 --> 21:59.944
you'll use

21:59.986 --> 22:02.321
the same good judgment

21:59.986 --> 22:02.321
that you used tonight.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.200
Because I never want

22:04.323 --> 22:06.200
to see you get hurt.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.411
I love you so much.

22:11.622 --> 22:15.084
I love you too,

22:11.622 --> 22:15.084
Uncle Jesse. Thank you.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.673
Alright, let's go home, huh?
