39:08.204 --> 39:09.204
Holy shit.

39:15.235 --> 39:16.685
Jade, how was Elle connected?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.393
I think Hawthorne works for her,

39:19.395 --> 39:22.328
or at least they're working
together on something,

39:24.715 --> 39:25.878
so who the hell is she?

39:27.105 --> 39:29.838
Intelligent, insane,

39:31.405 --> 39:32.533
dangerous.

39:32.535 --> 39:35.503
She was one of the very first
recruited into this program

39:35.505 --> 39:36.718
and well suited for it.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.975
She couldn't let go of her past.

39:40.835 --> 39:42.493
She eventually had to be pulled

39:42.495 --> 39:45.793
from the field and institutionalized.

39:45.795 --> 39:47.703
If we could find a facility

39:47.705 --> 39:48.973
that would hold her.

39:48.975 --> 39:53.478
She vanished from a high
security ward six years ago,

39:54.435 --> 39:56.483
and no one's heard from her.

39:56.485 --> 39:58.863
Well, you're hearing from her now.

40:02.125 --> 40:03.543

40:13.915 --> 40:14.915

40:15.715 --> 40:16.958

40:19.142 --> 40:21.383

Hawthorn and Elle yet.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.093
Our priority is to protect

40:23.095 --> 40:25.343
our operation's integrity.

40:25.345 --> 40:27.928
I tracked his signature to here.

40:28.865 --> 40:31.363
This heavily wooded area is in the middle

40:31.365 --> 40:35.663
of a training compound owned
by an independent militia

40:35.665 --> 40:37.543
called Hand to God.

40:37.545 --> 40:40.343
They are extreme right wing survivalists

40:40.345 --> 40:41.963
that receive most of their funding

40:41.965 --> 40:43.533
through the Darrian Group.

40:43.535 --> 40:47.733
They are very seclusive and very paranoid.

40:47.735 --> 40:49.053
The leaders are prominent members

40:49.055 --> 40:50.803
of the communities around the compound,

40:50.805 --> 40:53.453
so local law enforcement

40:53.455 --> 40:55.205
will be protective of them as well.

41:11.295 --> 41:12.683

41:12.685 --> 41:15.823
he may have told them about
any of our operations,

41:15.825 --> 41:19.173
particularly our work
on Darrian and Juliet.

41:19.175 --> 41:21.533
If you can bring him out quietly, then do.

41:25.225 --> 41:28.238

pulling anything else from him.

It doesn't feel like
a couple of decades,

59:26.385 --> 59:27.385
does it, Malcolm?

59:28.285 --> 59:30.533
Sees like just a couple of years

59:30.535 --> 59:33.073
since we got the go ahead
for your new division.

59:33.075 --> 59:34.858
MALCOLM: Chuck, why am I here?

59:36.112 --> 59:38.403
You know, I've never
really had to push you.

59:38.405 --> 59:39.993
You've always been very aggressive,

59:39.995 --> 59:43.323
and your teams have been
very effective for us.

59:43.325 --> 59:44.157
Well, I appreciate that,

59:44.159 --> 59:45.693
but why does it feel
like you just kissed me

59:45.695 --> 59:46.845
before bending me over?

59:48.175 --> 59:51.558
Well, your powers of observation
haven't deteriorated any.

59:54.445 --> 59:57.503
If it were the cartels or weapons dealers

59:57.505 --> 59:58.993

01:00:10.655 --> 01:00:11.534
I don't see your point.

01:00:11.536 --> 01:00:12.743
Where's the comparison?

01:00:12.745 --> 01:00:14.373
Well, there is no comparison, Malcolm,

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.003
and that is the point.

01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:18.003
This is coming from a single source.

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.683
It's not some fashion trend

01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:21.643

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.133
it's originating in the United States.

01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:30.088

01:00:33.205 --> 01:00:35.773
and one very well connected.

01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:38.673
How can I justify funding your division

01:00:38.675 --> 01:00:39.823

01:00:39.825 --> 01:00:42.463

01:00:42.465 --> 01:00:44.223
You've got Black working on this,

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:45.493

01:00:45.495 --> 01:00:46.668

No.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.263
We don't know exactly what it is,

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:06.673
but we know there's an antidote,

01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:08.803
and we know who the source is.

01:01:08.805 --> 01:01:09.883
Well, why don't we have him?

01:01:09.885 --> 01:01:11.523
It's a her, and her name is Elle,

01:01:11.525 --> 01:01:13.063
and she was one of ours,

01:01:13.065 --> 01:01:15.003
one of the first we
rescued from trafficking

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.843
and put into the program.

01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:18.643
She knows our MO

01:01:18.645 --> 01:01:20.088
as well as anyone ever will.

01:01:21.425 --> 01:01:22.274
That's why she's been able

01:01:22.276 --> 01:01:24.638

we knew her to inhabit,

01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:33.883

01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:35.283

Ty, you said it has to
remain in liquid form.

01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:43.417
Not likely.

01:10:43.419 --> 01:10:44.883
