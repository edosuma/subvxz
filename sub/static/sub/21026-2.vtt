successful gardening season,

02:29.735 --> 02:31.496
so we've got
some resources here,

02:31.530 --> 02:33.567

more horse feed

Yeah.

Depending on what kind

03:27.137 --> 03:30.520
I'm hoping that I can make it
to town in five days of travel,

Morgan: Well, if there's ice
in the rivers and I got to walk,

04:21.295 --> 04:22.503
it'll really slow me down,

04:22.538 --> 04:24.781
and Margaret's gonna have
to be here alone longer,

04:24.816 --> 04:27.991

this far out by yourself.

04:28.026 --> 04:30.166
You know, if you hurt yourself,
you can't call your neighbor

or bring wood in for you.

04:33.445 --> 04:37.587

the rafters at the top,

06:32.150 --> 06:36.119

rot the hay,

live on all winter,

individually-split shingles.

standard of craftsmanship

07:16.608 --> 07:17.851

Eustace: When I built
this barn 30 years ago,

07:20.129 --> 07:21.406
I just carved it all

07:21.441 --> 07:24.133
from what I found
right here in the woods,

07:24.167 --> 07:26.756
just like my ancestors
did hundreds of years ago.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.378
One, two, three.

07:28.413 --> 07:31.416
It's an architectural
tradition that's really old,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.523
and I want to celebrate it and
just kind of keep it matching.

07:34.557 --> 07:38.354
Narrator: The first step is cut
25 new nailer boards --

07:38.388 --> 07:41.150
long, wooden, cross pieces
that will patch up the gash

07:41.184 --> 07:43.773
in the roof and anchor
the shingles in place.

07:43.808 --> 07:47.501
What we'll do is, we'll just
slab off big slabs of wood,

07:47.536 --> 07:50.366
and we'll use those for nailers.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.644
And once we've busted it
into big pieces,

07:52.679 --> 07:55.129
we're gonna keep going into
smaller and smaller pieces,

07:55.164 --> 07:57.960
and, uh, split it with a froe.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.340
Yeah.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.998
Narrator: While an axe cleaves
a log with blunt force,

08:02.033 --> 08:04.794
a froe is a centuries-old
woodsman's tool

08:04.829 --> 08:08.488
designed to split timber
with surgical precision.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.835
Preston: These are
really effective tools.

08:10.869 --> 08:13.458
If they're in good shape
and they're sharp, uh, you know,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.633
they really, really work well.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.567
Eustace: Here's the real beauty
of what a froe does.

08:18.601 --> 08:20.223
-Leverage.
-We got leverage

08:20.258 --> 08:21.708
from here to here.
-Uh-huh.

08:21.742 --> 08:25.090
That makes it strong.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.368
What do you think?That'll work.

08:27.403 --> 08:29.681
Eustace: Once we have a pile
of boards from all these logs

08:29.716 --> 08:31.752
that are about
the right length and width,

08:31.787 --> 08:34.514
we put 'em side by side
and nail 'em on the shingles,

08:34.548 --> 08:36.170

keep the water out.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.449
