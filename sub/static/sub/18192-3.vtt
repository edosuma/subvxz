lt's quite common.
There was a piece in the Observer.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.599
Don't worry. lt's only the first time.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.998
- Second.
- No.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.631
Don't count then. l was practically asleep.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.076
You fell asleep.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.676
l think it was the motion.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.595
l'm the same on train journeys.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.556
Oh, how sweet is he!

02:14.280 --> 02:17.352
He's got this little smiley face like that.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.628
He's either dreaming or it's wind.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.996
What are you doing?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.391
Nothing.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.870
Come on! lt's nearly a month
since Adam was born.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.269
<i>Yeah, and stitches take six weeks to heal.</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:37.557
Ryan Giggs got a really nasty gash on his shin

02:37.640 --> 02:40.313
and he was fit to play the next weekend.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.436
Not quite childbirth, is it?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.156
Oh, come on. Can't we try?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.236
You want me to suffer pain?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.556
No.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.996
- l suppose you'll want to sleep now?
- No.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.595
l want to lie here and hold you.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.875
And tell you how much l love you.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.396
And then go to sleep.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.754
- Adam! Tell me how much you love me.
- Yeah, OK, OK, OK.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.274
Well, Rachel, l love you...

03:19.680 --> 03:22.797
..more than there are grains of sand on a beach.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.996
You've used that one already.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.711
Flies round shite?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.756
Nice!

03:30.240 --> 03:31.389
OK, OK.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.516
As much as l love George Best.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.911
Well, almost.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.956
All right.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.273
- Night.
- Night.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.796
You're not tired yet, are you?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.716
Apparently not.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.474
- Adam Williams.
- lt's David. What are you doing tonight?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.916
<i>- Um... Rach wants to see the new Mel Gibson.
- It's crap.</i>

04:25.000 --> 04:27.878
- What? Have you seen it?
- No, it's bound to be.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.350
Could you go another night?
l need to have a word.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.352
- Oh, yeah? What about?
- Well, it's a bit personal, actually.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.470
Sex? Excellent.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.755
Shall we say squash club, 6:30?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.796
OK, see you then. Bye.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.956
Ho, ho, ho!

04:45.040 --> 04:48.237
One, two, three, four, five...

04:49.720 --> 04:51.676
Sex!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.956
Oh, yes!

05:06.680 --> 05:08.636
A deciding game.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.553
- What do you want to talk about?
- Wait till we've finished.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.790
l'm meeting Rachel at the cinema.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.792
- What?
- You never said it was best of five.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.836
But you won the first two.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.672
So go on, then. Start talking.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.716
lt's a bit embarrassing.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.918
1-0.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.151
l'm listening.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.435
Well, you see... Karen and l...

05:39.120 --> 05:40.235
2-0.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.833
l can't play and talk!

05:41.920 --> 05:44.593
l haven't got time for both.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.716
Well, all right. You win.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.556
Let's talk.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.356
Christ, it must be serious.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.035
The thing is, Karen and l have...

05:59.920 --> 06:01.876
..are having a few problems.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.439
ln bed.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.715
Really? What kind of problems?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.439
l don't seem to be able to satisfy her.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.350
Well, it seems all right.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.351
l was hoping you could help.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.271
Satisfy Karen?

06:18.360 --> 06:19.395
Come on!

06:19.480 --> 06:21.391
Look, you shouldn't worry.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.914
Women just sometimes don't have an orgasm.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.956
Or so l've heard it said.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.956
lt's more serious than that.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.116
l can't perform.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.311
- What, really? You're impotent?
- Of course not.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.153
lt's no laughing matter. And it's not impotence.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.630
What would you call it, apart from ''unfortunate''?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.711
l seem to have lost the knack.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.631
Momentarily.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.676
Twice.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.069
l'm nervous about trying again.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.833
l wouldn't worry about it.
lt's just brewer's droop.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.639
- Have you been drinking a lot lately?
- No, l've given up.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.757
- Maybe you should start again.
- Do you think it would help?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.673
No, but it might take your mind off it.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.670
You should talk to your doctor.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.716
l don't like to bother her.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.311
l was hoping you'd help me.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.073
l thought you had to be senile to be impotent.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.151
l am not impotent, all right?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.196
All right!

07:27.120 --> 07:30.476
Tell you what. l'll ask around.
See if anyone's got any ideas.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.675
No!

07:33.280 --> 07:35.919
All right. But don't mention my name.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.271
- l've got this friend, right?
- Have you seen the new barmaid?

07:49.360 --> 07:50.509
What?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.556
She is sex.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.956
<i>- She's very attractive, yeah.
- No, no, no.</i>

07:57.040 --> 07:58.996
Attractive is not even close.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.075
<i>Sure. Anyway, this friend of mine...</i>

08:02.920 --> 08:07.038
She is the pure distillation
of man's basic sexual urges.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.638
She is fantasy made flesh.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.035
- She is...
- Coming over here.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.475
Watch this. (Clears throat)

08:17.160 --> 08:18.593
Not got any dead ones?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.636
Hang on.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.238
You want to be careful doing that.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.275
l can handle it.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.515
(Belches)

08:40.159 --> 08:42.116
What are you like?

08:42.840 --> 08:44.990
l don't know what's got into me.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.991
l do.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.198
Basically, me and Jen have not had sex
since Adam was born.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.751
- l thought he was sleeping now.
- Well, he is. And so's she. She's in quarantine.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.593
She's off limits until March 1 2th, 8pm.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.830
Some medical thing.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.595
Oh, l see!
And, meanwhile, Pete's getting randy.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.991
With a capital Rrrrrrr.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.275
l'm developing crushes all over the place.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.158
My secretary, Janice. She's due for retirement.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.196
Right. Sicko!

09:14.960 --> 09:17.758
This friend of mine has the opposite problem.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.990
What friend?

09:20.080 --> 09:22.435
No-one you know. Actually, you do.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.193
He's got a temporary bout of impotence.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.793
He hopes it's temporary.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.634
He was wondering if l'd ever met anyone
who might suffer something similar.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.029
A ''friend'' of yours?

09:33.120 --> 09:34.189
Yeah.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.236
Yes! Got it!

09:36.320 --> 09:38.276
(Coins rattle)

09:39.680 --> 09:43.150
Mate, basically you're talking to the wrong man.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.789
My problem isn't getting it up,
it's keeping the thing down.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.313
So you haven't got any suggestions for a cure?

09:58.920 --> 10:02.390
Apparently, Adam and Rachel
are having even less sex than us.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.038
Oh, yeah? Who told you that?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.031
Adam.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.678
Talk about your sex lives, do you?

10:07.760 --> 10:10.354
Well, no, l don't.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.874
There wouldn't be much to talk about.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.916
Does Adam?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.993
Well, he always tries to pretend
it's about someone else.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.153
What's all that about?
''l've got this friend who's got a problem.''

10:23.240 --> 10:24.958
l mean, it's pathetic.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.235
l take it you were sympathetic.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.390
Well...

10:29.480 --> 10:31.391
Boys! What are you like?

10:31.480 --> 10:35.189
You're never happier
than when your mate's unhappy.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.999
That's not true, but it is quite funny.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.233
You know what happens there, don't you?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.151
Oh, yes?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.231
My parents are coming to stay.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.719
You're joking!

10:50.800 --> 10:54.156
- (Squeaks) l'm a funny lady!
- Jen, don't do that to me.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.836
Be patient, Casanova.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.474
l probably shouldn't mention this.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.630
Bugger it. Adam and Rachel...

11:03.720 --> 11:05.711
Not getting on, apparently.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.917
We saw them at the weekend.
They seemed fine.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.560
Downstairs department. Sexually.

11:12.560 --> 11:16.189
Yeah, Adam told Pete.
ln a roundabout sort of way, like they do.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.271
What seems to be the problem?

11:18.360 --> 11:22.353
l don't know. Pete was a bit vague,
which is annoying.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.193
l got the impression it's just gone a bit stale.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.513
That's weird.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.910
Last time Rach and l talked sex,
she said they were doing it more than ever.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.228
Really?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.197
Probably trying to get it right.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.236
l hadn't thought of that.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.236
No, please, don't touch me!

11:44.680 --> 11:47.672
lt makes me realise how dead my skin feels.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.352
Would it help if l was to tell you we're not
the only ones having problems with sex?

11:57.440 --> 12:00.477
Oh, good.
You mean, there are other losers out there?

12:00.560 --> 12:02.516
Let's form a support group.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.756
- Who is it? Your sister, l suppose.
- David, that's mean.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.638
Anyway, she'd have to find a man first.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.950
No, actually.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.876
Adam and Rachel.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.151
Adam?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.834
Women just sometimes don't have an orgasm.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.876
Or so l've heard it's said.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.796
Little shit! He never said.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.519
- Why would he?
- Because l told him.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.556
Yeah.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.191
What seems to be the matter?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.191
Jenny wasn't sure.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.352
One of them is failing to set the other alight.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.512
lt must be Adam.
l can't see Rachel being a letdown.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.431
What exactly do you mean by that?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.592
A man's only got to look at Rachel to get a...

12:51.120 --> 12:53.076
She's pretty attractive.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.236
Not as much as you.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.476
This has cheered me up no end.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.199
David, are you sure you want to do this?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.796
Absolutely.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.877
Honestly. lt doesn't matter.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.755
Let's just go to sleep, shall we?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.911
David.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.479
Oh, a bit jumpy, aren't you?

13:40.560 --> 13:42.516
No, no, no. Just focused.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.675
''Keeping Up.'' What's that about?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.272
How to get ahead.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.236
How to get ahead in business.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.117
Mmm...

13:55.200 --> 13:58.670
l hear you oppose
moving production to Thailand.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.637
Oh, l wouldn't go that far.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.269
But the Bradford job losses
would be a PR disaster.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.238
- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Pardon?

14:07.320 --> 14:09.788
Do you have a problem with Bangkok?

14:11.080 --> 14:14.356
You'd better be up for it.
We can't pull out now.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.910
You know how stiff the competition is.
We can't afford a cockup.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.794
We must stand firm.
There's no room for limp dicks.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.916
Do you hear what l'm saying? Limp dicks.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.231
What?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.038
Oh, yes. Perfectly.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.473
Good.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.755
Oh, terrible news about Clive.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.798
- Clive?
- We're letting him go.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.951
- l had no idea.
- Neither does he...yet.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.515
Ramona, have you seen last week's Observer?

14:50.600 --> 14:54.388
lt's in my room.
l'm reading it to practise my English.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.119
<i>l read an interesting article about importance.</i>

14:57.200 --> 14:58.679
''lmportance''?

14:58.760 --> 15:02.150
<i>Yeah, you know,
important men who cannot sex their woman.</i>

15:02.240 --> 15:04.754
Very strange.
l never hear of this problem before.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.116
Yes, well, you're from Spain. You wouldn't have.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.515
<i>ls David still important, then?</i>

15:14.600 --> 15:16.670
A VlP.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.638
God, that must be so frustrating for him.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.278
And you.

15:21.360 --> 15:26.229
The worst part is having to buoy up his ego
when l'm the one being sold short.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.520
You must have to do the same for Adam.

15:30.080 --> 15:30.990
No.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.877
Oh.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.996
Oh, so it's you, not him?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.551
Er, listen, Rachel...

15:43.640 --> 15:46.871
Adam told Pete something
that l think l'd better tell you.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.351
Game, set and match.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.910
You're game's crap.
l take it you're still not rising to the occasion.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.752
Let's have another game.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.796
Are you sure? You're 4-0 down.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.475
- The court's still booked.
- Only for another five minutes.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.235
Still, at this rate,
we might get a couple of games in.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.832
You're well-pleased with yourself.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.515
- Well, l'm playing quite well.
- l mean generally. You think you're at the top.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.036
Let me ask you this?
Who's in the worse position?

16:22.120 --> 16:26.398
The guy who knows he's got a problem,
or the guy who doesn't know?

16:26.480 --> 16:29.472
- Are you saying l've got a problem?
- Didn't you know?

16:29.560 --> 16:31.312
No.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.958
l'd say you have. Big problem.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.590
No, hang on. Hang on. What?
What's my problem?

16:37.680 --> 16:42.629
Rachel is apparently dissatisfied
with your performance in bed.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.676
Wh-wh-what?!

16:45.720 --> 16:47.676
l don't think so!

16:49.400 --> 16:51.709
- How do you know?
- Karen told me.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.756
<i>Karen?</i>

16:55.240 --> 16:57.356
<i>She and Rachel are very close.</i>

16:57.960 --> 16:59.916
Uh-huh.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.236
1-0.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.955
<i>2-0.</i>

17:10.040 --> 17:11.996
(Both pant)

17:18.680 --> 17:20.796
That was fantastic.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.836
Wasn't it?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.194
- Leading the witness.
- What?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.236
That was fantastic.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.711
- Wasn't it?
- Mmm.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.109
- What else is she going to say?
- l don't know.

17:33.200 --> 17:38.513
- So he himself said it was fantastic?
- Yes...but Adam's very polite.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.397
''Thank you'' would have been nice.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.391
<i>lt's not what she says.</i>

17:42.480 --> 17:44.471
<i>lt's how she says it that's important.</i>

17:44.560 --> 17:46.437
Was it like...

17:46.520 --> 17:47.475
Hmm.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.788
Or was it more like...

17:48.880 --> 17:50.916
Mmmm!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.399
Somewhere in between.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.391
Were there any other signs?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.357
Like what?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.036
You know, did she...

18:01.560 --> 18:03.198
Rach, did you...?

18:03.280 --> 18:06.033
You didn't ask her? You should never ask 'em.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.318
- Why not?
- Because it admits the possibility of failure.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.470
Besides, she's bound to say...

18:12.560 --> 18:13.595
Yes.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.079
<i>KAREN: And did you?</i>

18:15.160 --> 18:18.197
No, l was too tense,
worrying that l was doing everything right.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.556
l knew she was lying. l was gutted.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.876
<i>RACHEL: Then he roIIs over
and goes to sIeep without so much as a cuddIe.</i>

18:26.960 --> 18:29.235
l must admit, Rach, it doesn't look good.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.276
Not good at all.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.948
Something for the weekend, madam?

18:48.040 --> 18:51.555
- What do you think of this?
- Christ! Does it carry a health warning?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.358
That will give him a heart attack.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.874
Particularly if he sees the price!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.916
Must be for the name.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.754
The sad thing is,
he used to prefer me with nothing on.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.511
Verdict?

19:04.600 --> 19:06.556
And our survey says...

19:08.280 --> 19:10.236
- l'll get it.
- Yeah.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.196
lt'll look lovely on you, that.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.236
l'm really pleased for you.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.518
- Can l assist you in any way?
- What?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.995
Do you have any books on sexual technique?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.115
Advanced sexual technique.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.758
Straight or gay?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.637
Straight.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.518
Second shelf. Beyond the necrophilia.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.156
Scoobydoobydoo!

20:11.920 --> 20:13.876
(Chuckles)

20:20.440 --> 20:22.396
Come on, Tiger.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.716
Hoorah!

20:37.080 --> 20:39.036
Oh... Love...

20:40.280 --> 20:42.475
Have you forgotten something?

20:44.200 --> 20:46.031
l love you.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.951
No.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.871
Condom.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.916
We don't use condoms.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.197
<i>No... We didn't use condoms.</i>

20:56.480 --> 20:58.436
We bloody well do now.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.716
A-ha-ha! A-ha!

21:12.160 --> 21:14.196
- No good.
- Hey?

21:14.280 --> 21:17.158
So, they're not ribbed, but they'll do.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.710
- They're past the sell-by date.
- What? Only by a year.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.679
Come on, Jen.
You don't have to eat the bloody thing.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.910
lf you don't want to.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.594
l'm not getting pregnant cos of rubber fatigue.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.636
We'll do without, then.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.157
- Come on, l'll be careful.
- Not in a million years!

21:35.240 --> 21:38.073
l've seen you play football.
l know what your timing's like.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.356
(Truck horn blares)

21:58.200 --> 22:01.351
- Sorry, mate. You just missed last orders.
- No, l don't need a drink.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.556
- That's all right, then.
- Can l use your loo?

22:03.640 --> 22:06.996
- Piss off!
- No, l don't need a wee.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.116
What do you need, then? A good slapping?

22:10.320 --> 22:11.639
l need to buy a condom.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.676
Eh?

22:13.760 --> 22:17.639
l've got this bird, right?
She's a blinder. Mad for it.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.275
- Bit tasty, is she?
- Peach.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.435
Mustn't keep the lady waiting.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.836
Jen... Jenny, l got one.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.638
Never been used.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.516
Jenny...

22:47.080 --> 22:49.036
Jen?

22:49.480 --> 22:51.436
(Snores)

22:58.560 --> 23:00.516
(Chuckles)

23:06.160 --> 23:08.196
Just don't say anything, OK?

23:13.840 --> 23:17.071
<i>- Are you still in the bathroom?
- I won't be Iong now.</i>

23:17.440 --> 23:19.351
Phwoooor!

23:19.440 --> 23:21.396
Just coming.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.711
<i>PETE: What did you think?</i>

23:33.800 --> 23:37.588
l can't be satisfying her
if she feels the need to kick-start me.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.671
Yes, but didn't it turn you on?

23:39.760 --> 23:42.354
Fantastic Sex had already done that.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.159
This just cocked the trigger.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.156
lt had the desired effect, then?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.549
Well, it certainly worked for me.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.915
lf speed's a measure of pleasure,

23:53.000 --> 23:57.278
l'd say it worked for him as well,
except that afterwards...

23:57.920 --> 23:59.876
Rach?

24:00.240 --> 24:02.196
Yeah?

24:02.760 --> 24:05.991
Do you think we're adventurous enough in bed?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.513
- How do you mean?
- Well, l mean...

24:11.840 --> 24:14.673
We've been together over a year now and...

24:14.760 --> 24:18.435
there aren't that many
different ways we make love.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.436
Well, how many are there?

24:22.960 --> 24:26.032
Loads we haven't tried, according to this.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.510
- We haven't got a hammock.
- No, nor a horse, but um...

24:32.600 --> 24:36.593
there's an interesting section
about acting out your fantasies.

24:36.680 --> 24:41.196
- He wants you to act out his fantasies?
- Worse, he wants to act out mine.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.158
Worse? Shit, it sounds great.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.071
- But l haven't got any.
- Bollocks.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.639
Mmm. Everybody has.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.153
Well, l haven't.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.152
- Use your imagination.
- Just think of anything.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.716
Like being taken by a great big,
fat, old, scuzzy businessman.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.119
Nice.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.796
No.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.475
No.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.596
No.

25:08.920 --> 25:15.029
You're a simple, hard-working Victorian maid,
performing your daily chores,

25:15.120 --> 25:19.159
when the firm hand of your master
pins you to the parquet.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.949
''You're a whore, but l love you.''
''Quiet, mistress might hear.''

25:29.800 --> 25:31.791
Something like that.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.235
Off the top of my head.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.956
Oh, come on, Rach.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.918
There must be something
you've always secretly craved.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.077
Well, there is one thing.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.071
Making love in a shop window?

25:52.280 --> 25:54.236
That's a bit public.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.476
l think that's the point.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.516
l know what my fantasy would be.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.316
Well, lads. lt's been a joy.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.790
But not as great
as the joy that awaits me at home.

26:10.880 --> 26:14.031
D'Artagnan, Aramis, l bid you good night.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.076
Have you got everything?

26:16.720 --> 26:18.676
Packet of 1 2.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.916
Quite a night.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.996
<i>At least he's happy.</i>

26:25.080 --> 26:27.640
l saw a new book about your problem.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.995
Keeping Up? l've already got it.

26:30.960 --> 26:34.635
lt starts promisingly
but doesn't live up to expectations.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.070
l've decided it's time for professional help.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.836
You're going to see a shrink?

26:43.360 --> 26:45.157
A prostitute.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.551
l'll be two minutes.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.596
Two minutes.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.792
Making love in a shop window?

28:03.960 --> 28:05.871
What are you thinking?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.757
Oh, nothing.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.398
You liar.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.831
lt's nothing important.
Just how much our lives have changed.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.836
That's true.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.834
We never used to have to
keep the noise down during sex.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.795
Only when your parents stayed.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.516
Are you happy?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.191
Yeah. Of course l am.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.838
And so you should be.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.480
l know. l know. lt's just...

28:44.440 --> 28:46.351
lt's just not the same.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.351
Sex.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.396
Cos Jenny's had a baby?

28:51.160 --> 28:53.674
She's bound to sag but she'll firm up.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.716
Not like that!

28:56.600 --> 28:58.556
l mean, she's different.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.556
She's a mother.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.310
Take that woman there.
The one with the shopping bags.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.436
<i>Do you think she's a mother?</i>

29:11.520 --> 29:13.988
- Yes.
- Do you fancy her?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.636
No.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.796
Take that woman over there.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.791
<i>The one with the bIonde hair.</i>

29:24.880 --> 29:27.553
<i>- Do you think she's a mother?
- No.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:30.279
- Do you fancy her?
- Oh, yes.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.711
Hang on. She's about 50 years older than her.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.556
What about her over there?

29:39.640 --> 29:41.710
<i>Do you fancy her?</i>

29:42.840 --> 29:44.796
ls she a mother?

30:08.200 --> 30:10.156
(Buzzing)

30:11.840 --> 30:14.400
<i>WOMAN: CouId you wait a minute?
- Sure, yeah.</i>

30:15.440 --> 30:17.396
No problem.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.559
<i>OK, you're on. First fIoor.</i>

30:40.320 --> 30:43.596
- Can l get you a drink?
- That's very kind of you.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.390
Yeah, beer.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.830
lt's a nice place you've got here.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.195
lf you work at home,
you might as well make it comfortable.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.669
This is your first time, right?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.716
How did you know?

31:08.080 --> 31:11.356
Look, l expect you...want to be paid upfront.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.236
That much TV gets right.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.311
£60.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.879
Sure. Sure.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.676
What's your name, sweetheart?

31:28.440 --> 31:31.159
- Adam.
- And your real name?

31:31.240 --> 31:32.639
David.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.351
Right, Adam. We're going to take this...

31:40.880 --> 31:42.836
..nice and easy.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.878
Can't we just... Could we just talk first?

31:47.960 --> 31:51.270
Whatever you want, Adam.
The meter's running.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.636
Call me David.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.751
So, what's your name?

32:00.840 --> 32:02.956
- Trixie.
- And your real name?

32:03.040 --> 32:04.951
Trixie.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.356
Oh, sorry.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.516
Well, it suits you.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.708
- l mean...
- Why are you here, David?

32:19.960 --> 32:22.190
Well, l er...

32:23.000 --> 32:24.956
l-l'm...

32:26.960 --> 32:29.235
..impotent.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.760
- No, you're not.
- That's easy for you say.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.638
- Look, you've done it before, right?
- Oh, yeah.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.950
And you'll be able to do it again.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.998
lt's just for the moment
you can't stand and deliver.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.435
- Do you really think so?
- Sweetie, it's practically common.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.988
l must have seen it six times.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.390
- Hell, impotence has earned me...
- £360.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.596
You work with figures, right?

32:54.120 --> 32:57.078
Look, no offence, but you're all the same.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.118
Stressed out in top jobs. l've had 'em all.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.078
A judge, a surgeon, a management consultant.

33:03.160 --> 33:06.789
<i>- Oh, who was that?
- Make that two management consultants.</i>

33:08.680 --> 33:10.830
You see, the thing is...

33:10.920 --> 33:12.876
this is affecting my work.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.916
l used to be a power in the office.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.636
Now l have to queue for the coffee.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.635
You see, the way l see it is...

33:21.720 --> 33:24.154
l've got to get my manhood back.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.676
l reckon if l can have just...

33:29.120 --> 33:30.633
..one shag...

33:31.720 --> 33:35.190
Excuse the pun, David,
but you're coming at this all wrong.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.239
<i>You've got to get on top of your job,
then your wife.</i>

33:41.600 --> 33:44.478
- Do you think so?
- Honey, l know so.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.951
That judge l mentioned...

33:47.040 --> 33:50.589
After seeing me,
he sent two bank robbers down for life.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.992
Their families weren't pleased,
but his secretary was!

33:58.720 --> 34:00.676
Yeah.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.311
Thank you, Trixie, l...

34:08.400 --> 34:10.356
Yeah.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.275
Absolutely, yeah.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.070
l love guys who can't get it up.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.958
They tip big and they don't leave a mess.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.556
Yes.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.156
So, what's the crack?

34:42.920 --> 34:45.036
- l'm cheating on my wife.
- Shut up.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.076
l'm cheating on my wife.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.032
Shit! Who with?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.630
No!

34:53.719 --> 34:55.676
You bastard!

34:57.520 --> 34:59.476
You bastard.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.389
- She's playing it very cool.
- She doesn't know.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.436
What?

35:04.520 --> 35:07.910
Last night,
me and Jen were in bed together.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.116
(Sighs)

35:13.400 --> 35:17.154
We haven't made much impression
on your packet of 1 2.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.314
l didn't want to force myself on you.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.992
Why not?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.036
lt sounds good to me.

35:29.560 --> 35:34.588
Cos l've been a bad, bad girl, master.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.033
Can we skip this part, please?

35:36.120 --> 35:38.076
No.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.199
<i>We were reaIIy going at it. WeII, Jen was.</i>

35:45.560 --> 35:48.552
<i>And I just feIt Iike Jane Fonda in KIute.</i>

35:49.880 --> 35:52.155
When she's in bed with Donald Sutherland.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.073
- You didn't look at your watch?
- l wasn't wearing it.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.116
Yes, squire!

35:57.200 --> 36:00.237
Do...be...mean...to me.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.432
Yeah, yeah...

36:05.520 --> 36:07.476
You...bastard.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.551
<i>ADAM: Hang on a minute.</i>

36:10.640 --> 36:12.471
<i>Where does she come in?</i>

36:14.480 --> 36:16.755
<i>Just about...now.</i>

36:18.680 --> 36:21.638
- Oh, you're great!
- Oh, yes!

36:22.120 --> 36:24.156
Oh, Pete. You're fantastic.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.156
Oh, Pete. Oh, you're so big.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.316
<i>You dirty oId sod!</i>

36:39.800 --> 36:42.997
She's got a tattoo of a dolphin
on her left buttock.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.799
- She hasn't!
- No, probably not.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.955
l feel like l've betrayed Jenny.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.874
ln your mind. That doesn't count.
Did Jenny complain?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.079
<i>JENNY: Yes!</i>

36:55.160 --> 36:57.913
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

36:58.000 --> 36:59.353
No.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.835
Coffee, please, Sam,
and get me Martin on the phone.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.916
Martin, my office now.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.151
What kept you?
What time did l want that report?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.071
- By 1 1 :00.
- And what time is it now?

37:18.160 --> 37:20.833
1 1 :1 5. There was a problem
with the photocopying.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.799
Martin, don't bring me problems, solve them.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.392
Yes, David.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.629
<i>- NataIie, come in. Coffee?
- Please.</i>

37:30.720 --> 37:32.676
Another coffee, Sam.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.468
ls there something l can do for you?

37:36.400 --> 37:39.517
l only wish there were.
The Conways move to Bangkok...

37:39.600 --> 37:42.433
The collapse of the Thai economy
makes it less attractive?

37:42.520 --> 37:44.351
<i>Bradford's working to ruIe.</i>

37:44.440 --> 37:46.032
lt's a disaster.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.395
No, it's an opportunity.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.040
- We can turn it to our advantage.
- l don't see how.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.153
We plant a piece in the FT,
claiming Bangkok is the best move.

37:56.240 --> 37:59.038
- lt goes ahead whatever.
- That'll impress the unions.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.793
- They'll strike immediately.
- Hopefully.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.678
The workers will soon notice
the hole in their pay.

38:05.640 --> 38:09.599
- And then?
- We call off the move, bowing to local pressure,

38:09.680 --> 38:13.036
in return for increased productivity
and no pay rise for a year.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.315
- Two years.
- You strike a hard bargain.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.436
Conways' Managers will know we goofed.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.991
We'll tell them we kept them in the dark
so they wouldn't be compromised.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.389
David, that's brilliant!

38:24.480 --> 38:26.436
l can be.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.351
Where did you get the key?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.351
A guy l know at work.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.476
He does weekend shifts here.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.912
- Did you have to explain why we needed them?
- l said it was for late-night shopping!

38:50.000 --> 38:51.956
Of course l had to explain.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.315
Look, don't worry, he's fine.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.472
He even said he'd rearrange the shop for us.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.555
Are you sure you want to do this?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.516
The things l do for love.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.312
Come on, girl.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.076
(TV on)

39:28.520 --> 39:30.238
Coming up?

39:30.320 --> 39:32.276
Now... Please.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.351
l want to see this debate about
the common agricultural policy.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.996
lnteresting.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.315
One for Pete,

39:48.400 --> 39:50.391
and one for Pete.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.676
Come on, Tiger.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.633
Are you sure no-one can see us?

40:03.720 --> 40:06.075
Rachel, there is no-one to see us.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.711
We'd better make this a quickie.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.995
Not a problem!

40:14.080 --> 40:15.991
(Key in lock)

40:16.080 --> 40:18.036
What was that?

40:19.040 --> 40:22.350
- lt's burglars!
- Who would burgle a charity shop?

40:23.200 --> 40:25.270
(Door closing)

40:25.360 --> 40:27.112
Or lock up afterwards.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.836
Go on.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.196
(Pants)

40:59.040 --> 41:01.759
- We seem to have a problem.
- You've got the keys.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.796
<i>l've got a key.</i>

41:04.680 --> 41:08.150
lt's been double-locked by the office upstairs.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.073
- We're locked in?
- Only till morning.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.991
Don't worry. We can hide.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.072
lf someone comes in,
we can pretend we're customers.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.434
Look, come on. We're here now.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.115
We may as well make the most of it.

41:46.520 --> 41:47.589
Jen, no. Stop.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.635
You what?

41:48.720 --> 41:50.472
Stop, stop, stop.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.039
We've got to talk.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.680
- Eh?
- We've got to talk.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.950
Adam, l love you.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.036
(Sirens)

42:54.480 --> 42:57.074
Oi! Stay where you are. Police. Don't move!

42:57.160 --> 42:58.957
<i>Put your hands over your heads.</i>

43:00.560 --> 43:03.711
Maybe you'd better put them back down again.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.069
To be honest, love, you know...

43:13.320 --> 43:16.517
l was worried about doing it after so long.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.355
The whole having a baby thing...

43:22.320 --> 43:24.675
l thought sex might be different.

43:26.360 --> 43:29.158
Anyway, it turns out it was. For you.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.196
Yeah, l know.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.952
lt's my problem.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.316
<i>lt's not. lt's our problem
if you don't fancy me any more.</i>

43:36.400 --> 43:38.356
l do.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.836
l will.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.434
You know, when we got married,

43:48.200 --> 43:51.431
sex was different than when we first went out.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.952
Less frequent.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.395
Well...it was less frantic.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.951
Yeah, but it was still good fun.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.996
Well, exactly. You know...

44:02.000 --> 44:03.956
But it had changed, hadn't it?

44:04.960 --> 44:07.952
Like our relationship had changed and...

44:08.800 --> 44:10.631
And l think...

44:10.720 --> 44:14.030
l think that sex will, you know, go on changing.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.036
You know, every year.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.997
Till we're 70.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.791
Urgh!

44:22.880 --> 44:26.316
You don't think
we'll still be having sex when we're 70?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.311
Well, yeah. Why not?

44:28.400 --> 44:32.678
There won't be much movement
involved but it'll still be us.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.275
My point is this,
that having a baby is a big change.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.508
You know, for both of us, love.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.596
l'm still your wife.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.276
And a mother.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.715
You always fancied three in a bed.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.716
Think you can handle us?

45:01.840 --> 45:04.035
Maybe one at a time.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.956
What's it to be tonight, then?

45:07.880 --> 45:10.838
Mother...or lover?

45:16.640 --> 45:18.756
Hold me, Mummy.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.313
David, you're back.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.076
And how!

46:02.160 --> 46:04.037
(Tiger's growl)

46:07.120 --> 46:09.918
- (Laughter outside)
- All right, that's enough.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.636
l'll only be five minutes.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.271
(Laughter)

46:17.360 --> 46:19.316
Hey, don't l know you?

46:19.400 --> 46:22.039
l don't have a record... Yet.

46:22.120 --> 46:25.999
l was at the birth of your mate's baby.
Adam, isn't it?

46:26.080 --> 46:28.196
- Preston!
- How's the little fella doing?

46:28.280 --> 46:30.840
- Oh, fine. Great.
- He's just started smiling.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.115
That's always a lovely moment.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.596
So...

46:37.920 --> 46:40.036
Do you want to tell me about it?

46:45.320 --> 46:48.392
- Rachel wanted to make love in public.
- No, l did not.

46:48.480 --> 46:53.395
<i>- Yes, you did. lt's your sexual fantasy.
- Yes, and you insisted on acting it out.</i>

46:57.600 --> 46:59.955
We'd been having problems in bed.

47:00.920 --> 47:03.753
- He's not been happy.
- lt's you who's been dissatisfied.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.796
Since when?

47:09.080 --> 47:11.036
You mean you haven't?

47:12.520 --> 47:13.953
And you haven't either?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.911
lt's good to talk.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.195
<i>RACHEL: It was nice of him to Iet us go.</i>

47:23.080 --> 47:25.036
lt was nice, full stop.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.916
l want to do it again.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.559
Won't being in our own bed be a letdown?
