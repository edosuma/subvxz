08:57.500 --> 08:59.667
I CALLED YOU,
BUT GOT NO ANSWER.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.041
AH, I CRASHED EARLY.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.333
(Addison) HEY, PETE.
HEY.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.000
HAVE FUN AT YOUR CLASS.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.625
HAVE FUN AT YOUR CLASS.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.625
I AM BEING A FRIEND, OKAY?
WE ARE DOING FRIENDSHIP.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.041
(laughs)
YEAH, I'M YOUR FRIEND,

09:15.083 --> 09:17.667
AND YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN
THAT NICE TO ME, EVER.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.667
WE'RE ADJUSTING, ALL RIGHT.
JUST--THANK YOU.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.667
WHENEVER WE GIVE EACH OTHER
A HARD TIME

09:21.709 --> 09:24.667
OR WE START TO FIGHT,
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN...
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN

09:24.709 --> 09:27.667
THE TWO OF YOU
GET HOT FOR EACH OTHER.
YES, I KNOW.
IT'S TWISTED. BUT--

09:27.709 --> 09:30.667
OKAY, AND SEE THAT'S WHY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

09:30.709 --> 09:32.041
ABOUT MY COP, YOU KNOW?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.041
I MEAN, I THINK MAYBE
HE'S INTERESTED,

09:34.083 --> 09:36.041
BUT THEN MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T INFLICT MYSELF

09:36.083 --> 09:38.041
ON A DECENT, UNSUSPECTING
OFFICER OF THE PEACE.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.041
WELL, MAYBE--MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT YOU NEED.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.667
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.667
MY TRACK RECORD
WITH MEN LATELY,

09:43.709 --> 09:45.709
HE'S PROBABLY A CRAZY.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.041
(sighs)

09:50.083 --> 09:52.667
WE CHECKED YOUR L.H. LEVELS,
AND THEY'RE NORMAL.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.041
YOU'RE OVULATING.
GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.041
WELL, WE DID FIND
SOME FIBROIDS,

09:57.083 --> 09:59.917
SO WE SHOULD MONITOR THEM
JUST TO--
I KNEW IT. IT'S ALWAYS ME.

09:59.959 --> 10:02.041
FIRST MY VAGINA WAS LOCKED,
AND NOW--

10:02.083 --> 10:04.208
YOU SHOULD GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
I AM A DUD.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.250
THE FERTILITY ISSUE
DOESN'T LIE WITH YOU.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.250
GEOFFREY, WE CHECKED
YOUR SPERM COUNT,

10:09.291 --> 10:11.333
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS VERY LOW.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.834
H-HOW LOW?

10:13.875 --> 10:17.041
THERE ARE NO VIABLE SPERM
IN YOUR SPECIMEN.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.083
I'M SORRY, GEOFFREY.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.709
YOU'RE STERILE.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.291
(Naomi) I KNOW THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.792
BUT THERE IS HOPE.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.792
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.333
THERE'S SPERM DONATION,
ADOPTION--

10:39.375 --> 10:42.959
THE MAIN THING IS, YOU CAN
HAVE A CHILD, A FAMILY.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.792
NO ADOPTION.
WAIT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE
SHOULD BE RULING THAT OUT.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.041
WE'RE GOING
WITH A SPERM DONOR.
BUT, HONEY--

10:49.083 --> 10:51.041
NO. YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE PREGNANT.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.041
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A BABY OF YOUR OWN.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.625
DO WE HAVE TO DECIDE NOW?
IS THERE A REASON TO RUSH?

10:56.667 --> 10:58.625
NOT TO RUSH, BUT, UH,
FERTILITY DOES DECLINE

10:58.667 --> 11:01.500
EVERY YEAR FOR A WOMAN
AFTER THE AGE OF 35.

11:01.542 --> 11:05.500
AND THE FIBROIDS
COULD EVENTUALLY INTERFERE--

11:05.542 --> 11:08.917
ALL RIGHT. WE GET IT.
WE'VE GOTTA GO FOR IT NOW.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.041
LOOK, THEY SAID
YOU'RE OVULATING.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.750
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
WE'RE IN THE ZONE TO TRY?

11:14.792 --> 11:18.041
THAT'S--THAT'S RIGHT. YES.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.208
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

11:20.250 --> 11:22.000
CATHLEEN, I LOVE YOU.

11:22.041 --> 11:25.000
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT I WANT.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.041
I'M SURE.

11:30.834 --> 11:32.792
SO WHAT'S WRONG
WITH DELL'S GRANDDAD?

11:32.834 --> 11:35.417
OH, IT'S JUST SOME
MINOR BUMPS AND BRUISES.

11:35.458 --> 11:38.417
DELL'S CONCERNED THAT THERE
MIGHT BE SOME ABUSE GOING ON,

11:38.458 --> 11:41.542
BUT NATE AND WENDELL ARE ADAMANT
THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.542
WELL, DELL'S GRANDFATHER
IS A WAR VET.

11:43.583 --> 11:47.792
I THINK HE'D BE TOO PROUD
TO ADMIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WHERE'S THE MOM?

11:47.834 --> 11:49.792
DELL'S ALWAYS GETTING
THOSE POSTCARDS FROM INDIA

11:49.834 --> 11:51.792
AND CHINA
AND ALL OVER THE PLACE?
YEAH, I ASKED HIM ONCE.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.667
HE SAID THAT
SHE WAS A ROLLING STONE.
YEAH, SHE ROLLED RIGHT OFF

11:54.709 --> 11:56.667
AND LEFT DELL
WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.750
WENDELL WENT INTO A HOME
AFTER HIS WIFE DIED.

11:58.792 --> 12:01.041
WOW. YOU SURE KNOW
A LOT ABOUT DELL.
SERIOUSLY,

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
IF DELL SUSPECTS SOMETHING,
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD--

12:03.083 --> 12:06.041
I JUST READ A PAPER
ABOUT ELDER ABUSE.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.041
IT'S WAY UNDERREPORTED.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CALL THE NURSING HOME,

12:09.083 --> 12:11.375
SEE IF I CAN GET AHOLD
OF HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.041
HEY, SAM.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.917
TELL ME WHAT THAT
WAS ABOUT EARLIER.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.041
OH. UH...

12:18.083 --> 12:20.792
I JUST THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE NICE

12:20.834 --> 12:22.875
IF WE KEPT
THIS THING PRIVATE.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.875
WELL, SOMEBODY ALREADY
FOUND OUT, SAM.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.166
AND HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

12:27.208 --> 12:30.041
OH.
WHAT, ARE--ARE YOU AFRAID THAT
THIS IS GONNA MEAN COMMITMENT?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.166
WHAT? BECAUSE IF, YOU KNOW,

12:31.208 --> 12:33.667
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE--
NAOMI--

12:33.709 --> 12:35.709
UM, NAOMI, I GOT THESE LABS
FOR YOUR PATIENT--

12:35.750 --> 12:38.125
JUST LEAVE IT ON MY DESK.
EXCUSE ME.
(sputters)

12:38.166 --> 12:39.625
ALL RIGHT. SORRY.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.875
YEAH.

12:40.917 --> 12:42.041
JEEZ.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.041
THEY'RE REALLY
GOING AT IT LATELY.

12:44.083 --> 12:47.041
ONE MINUTE, THEY'RE GRINNING,
THEN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'RE--

12:47.083 --> 12:49.083
YOU THINK THEY'RE
"GOING AT IT"?

12:49.125 --> 12:50.875
SEX?
YEAH.

12:50.917 --> 12:54.041
NO. NO.
YOU THINK SO?

12:54.083 --> 12:56.041
AS MUCH AS THEY ARGUE?

12:56.083 --> 12:59.291
ANGRY SEX IS HOT.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.083
(scoffs)

13:03.542 --> 13:05.500
SO I CALLED THE NURSING HOME,

13:05.542 --> 13:08.208
AND THEY SENT OVER WENDELL
AND NATE'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.500
THERE ARE A BUNCH
OF INJURY REPORTS

13:10.542 --> 13:13.333
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS--
MINOR SCRAPES, BRUISES.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.583
SO I WAS RIGHT
TO BE CONCERNED.

13:15.625 --> 13:18.166
WELL, IT'S NOT PROOF
OF ANYTHING, BUT, YEAH,

13:18.208 --> 13:20.166
YOU WERE RIGHT
TO BE CONCERNED.

13:20.208 --> 13:24.041
I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE
AND CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.333
NO, I CAN HANDLE THIS, OKAY?
NO, YOU BROUGHT THEM TO ME,

13:26.375 --> 13:27.792
SO TECHNICALLY,
THEY'RE MY PATIENTS,

13:27.834 --> 13:29.709
WHICH MEANS LEGALLY,
I'M AS OBLIGATED TO THEM

13:29.750 --> 13:32.041
AS ANYONE ELSE.
I TOLD YOU, I-I DON'T--

13:32.083 --> 13:33.375
DELL, I'M GOING.

13:36.542 --> 13:41.291
(Cooper) ALL RIGHT, LET'S START
BY PICKING UP OUR BABIES.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.333
BUT WITH TWO HANDS.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.834
MY BABY LOOKS LIKE CHUCKY.
DO YOU WANT TO TRADE?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.750
NO WAY.
ALL RIGHT,
NO TRADING BABIES.

13:49.792 --> 13:53.041
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING
TO TEACH YOU IN THIS CLASS

13:53.083 --> 13:56.041
IS HOW TO BOND
WITH YOUR NEWBORN.
I DON'T WANT TO BOND
WITH CHUCKY.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.041
THESE BABIES ARE GONNA
COME INTO YOUR LIFE,

13:58.083 --> 14:00.041
AND THEY'RE GONNA SEEM
SO SMALL AND FRAGILE

14:00.083 --> 14:02.125
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE AFRAID
TO TOUCH THEM.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.333
DON'T BE.
UH, THEY NEED TO BE HELD,

14:04.375 --> 14:07.333
AND THEY'RE A LOT TOUGHER
THAN THEY LOOK.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.125
YEAH, I HEARD A BABY CAN EAT,

14:09.166 --> 14:12.041
LIKE, HALF A CUP OF SAND
AND BE FINE.
THAT'S NOT--

14:12.083 --> 14:14.166
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT BABY
THAT FELL 11 STORIES,

14:14.208 --> 14:17.041
CRAWLED AWAY
WITHOUT A SCRATCH?

14:17.083 --> 14:20.041
IT'S WHAT YOU SAID, MAN.
YOU CAN'T BREAK A BABY.
(Cooper) YEAH, YOU--YOU CAN.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.417
FROM 11 STORIES,
TOTALLY BREAKABLE.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.458
UM, WHO--
WHO'S YOUR PEDIATRICIAN?

14:23.500 --> 14:26.458
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T WE
START WITH THE BASICS?

14:26.500 --> 14:29.667
YES. UM...
CHANGING A DIAPER.

14:29.709 --> 14:32.083
WHO WANTS TO GIVE IT
A TRY?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.417
I'D LIKE TO TRY.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.000
ADAM--OUR FIRST VOLUNTEER.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.041
LET'S DO THIS.
DR. PETE?

14:42.083 --> 14:44.041
OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
PUT YOUR BABIES DOWN.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.041
SUPPORT THE HEAD. SUPPORT--
NEXT TIME, SUPPORT THE HEAD.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.500
(Dell) HE'S PROBABLY
WITH NATE OR ARTHUR.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.041
THEY PLAY BINGO TOGETHER.
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

14:52.083 --> 14:54.500
HERE. (clears throat)

14:56.458 --> 14:58.291
WE'RE LOOKING FOR WENDELL.
HE'S IN ROOM 310.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.458
YEAH.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.375
UH, IF HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM,
I DON'T--

15:02.417 --> 15:05.375
NO, WE CHECKED HIS ROOM.
HE'S NOT THERE, OKAY?

15:05.417 --> 15:07.667
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING THEM?

15:07.709 --> 15:10.625
(sighs) THEY GIVE ME
$5 AN HOUR NOT TO.

15:10.667 --> 15:14.041
IF YOU CAN DO BETTER...

15:15.625 --> 15:18.083
YOU THINK THAT GUY
WAS JUST MESSING WITH US?

15:18.125 --> 15:21.041
I SHOULD--I SHOULD'VE
GIVEN HIM A 20.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.750
(faint cheering)

15:22.792 --> 15:24.291
YOU HEAR THAT?

15:24.333 --> 15:27.417
YEAH, I HEAR IT.

15:27.458 --> 15:30.417
(cheering grows louder)

15:30.458 --> 15:33.333
(all yelling at once)

15:33.375 --> 15:36.333
(crowd cheering)

15:36.375 --> 15:38.750
OH!
(cheering continues)

15:40.083 --> 15:44.667
(cheering)

15:44.709 --> 15:49.667
(crowd yelling indistinctly)

15:49.709 --> 15:52.125
STOP, STOP! YOU TWO
ARE GONNA KILL EACH OTHER.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.959
WHOA!

15:54.000 --> 15:56.041
(crowd yelling)
PA PA!

15:56.083 --> 15:58.458
STAY OUTTA THIS.
THIS IS A CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.291
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
MAKING EXCUSES

16:01.333 --> 16:03.083
WHEN I KICK HIS BUTT.
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.083
EXCEPT YOU
GROWING A PAIR.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.500
OH!

16:06.542 --> 16:09.375
(crowd yelling)

16:09.417 --> 16:12.041
COME ON. GET UP.
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

16:12.083 --> 16:14.041
OH, NO.
HIS HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 30.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.041
I CAN BARELY FEEL HIS PULSE.
HE'S HURT.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.333
SURE HE IS. COME ON.
GET UP, YOU OLD GEEZER.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.792
GET SOME MORE OF THIS.
NO, NO, GAME OVER.
HE'S REALLY HURT.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.125
WE GOTTA GET HIM
AN AMBULANCE.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.375
I NEED TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL NOW.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.041
(Cooper) GOOD FIRST DAY,
YOU GUYS.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.834
CHECK YOUR BABIES
AT THE DOOR.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.041
GUYS, UH, THAT WAS AMAZING.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.125
UM, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANY HOMEWORK.
NO, NO HOMEWORK.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.583
YOU KNOW, ADAM, YOUR ENERGY
IS GREAT FOR THIS CLASS,

16:38.625 --> 16:40.583
AND IT'S OKAY TO BE NERVOUS.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.583
THAT'S TOTALLY NORMAL
FOR A FIRST-TIME DAD.
OH, THANKS,
BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT A DAD.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.375
I'M JUST HERE FOR JACK.
JACK IS YOUR PARTNER?

16:46.417 --> 16:49.083
OH, NO, NO. WELL, HE'S A PARTNER
AT THE FIRM, OF COURSE,

16:49.125 --> 16:51.917
BUT I'M JUST HIS ASSISTANT.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.125
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
TAKING THE CLASS.
JACK IS YOUR BOSS?

16:54.166 --> 16:56.166
YEAH.
HE SENT--
HE SENT HIS ASSISTANT.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.041
WELL, SECOND ASSISTANT,
ACTUALLY, BUT, UH, NOT FOR LONG,

16:58.083 --> 17:02.083
THANKS TO THIS CLASS.
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM
TO BE HERE.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.041
OH, NO. NO, NO,
I COULDN'T TELL HIM THAT.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.208
HE'LL DESTROY ME
OR HAVE ME DESTROYED.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.750
LOOK, PLEASE J--
ADAM, THE ONLY REQUIREMENT
FOR THIS DAD'S CLASS

17:08.792 --> 17:10.750
IS YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA BE A DAD,

17:10.792 --> 17:13.375
SO IF YOUR BOSS
WANTS TO TAKE THE CLASS,

17:13.417 --> 17:15.041
HE HAS TO ATTEND HIMSELF.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.041
HEY, YOU'RE STILL HERE?

17:24.083 --> 17:25.250
(sighs) CATHLEEN WENT BACK

17:25.291 --> 17:28.041
FOR ONE MORE LOOK
AT THE SPERM DONOR BOOK.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.542
SHE'S HOPING SOMETHING
WILL CLICK.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.125
I'M GONNA GIVE HER
THIS BABY.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.041
I BELIEVE YOU.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.625
YOU'RE DETERMINED.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.166
BUT...

17:38.208 --> 17:42.041
WHY SO DETERMINED?

17:42.083 --> 17:45.250
CATHLEEN NEVER ASKS
FOR MUCH.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.041
I PROMISED HER A HAPPY LIFE.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.291
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
GET OVER YOURSELF

17:50.333 --> 17:52.041
IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

17:52.083 --> 17:54.625
WELL, I WONDER HOW CATHLEEN
WOULD FEEL ABOUT THAT--

17:54.667 --> 17:56.709
YOU DISREGARDING
YOUR OWN FEELINGS

17:56.750 --> 17:58.834
TO GIVE HER
WHAT SHE WANTS.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.917
SHE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT IT MUCH,

18:00.959 --> 18:02.917
BUT CATHLEEN WAS ADOPTED.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.041
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT
GREAT PARENTS, BUT...

18:05.083 --> 18:07.041
I WANTED TO GIVE HER
WHAT I HAD,

18:07.083 --> 18:08.375
YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.041
THEY'RE CRAZY, BUT...

18:10.083 --> 18:12.500
IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT SHE GETS TO HAVE

18:12.542 --> 18:15.041
ONE PERSON IN HER LIFE
THAT LOOKS LIKE HER.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.125
BUT WHAT ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT, GEOFFREY?

18:18.166 --> 18:21.041
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU...

18:21.083 --> 18:24.041
GO HOME, GET SOME SLEEP,
THINK ABOUT IT,

18:24.083 --> 18:27.250
AND THEN START OVER
TOMORROW?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.250
H-HOW IS HE?

18:37.291 --> 18:40.041
WELL, HE, UH, HE HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.750
WE'RE TRYING TO REOPEN
HIS BLOCKED VESSELS.

18:42.792 --> 18:46.041
I DID THAT?
I-I DID THAT TO HIM?

18:46.083 --> 18:49.041
WELL, I'M SURE IT DIDN'T HELP
THAT YOU DECKED HIM,

18:49.083 --> 18:52.875
BUT, UH, WE CAN'T SAY
RIGHT NOW.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.583
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.041
WE--WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANYONE TO GET HURT.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.041
OKAY, THEN WHY
DID YOU HIT EACH OTHER?

18:59.083 --> 19:01.208
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.917
THE DAYS THERE...

19:02.959 --> 19:04.917
YOU--YOU CAN'T
TELL ONE FROM ANOTHER.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.667
ME, NATE--
WE WERE ALL GOING CRAZY.

19:08.709 --> 19:11.041
YEAH, WELL,
THAT PART'S OBVIOUS.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.667
DELL, MAYBE YOUR GRANDDAD,
HE--HE JUST NEEDS A MINUTE--
I GOT IT.

19:14.709 --> 19:17.625
I NEED YOU TO SWEAR, OKAY?
NO MORE OF THIS.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.750
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
IT'S OVER?

19:26.458 --> 19:27.959
DELL...

19:32.250 --> 19:34.458
(sighs)

19:41.208 --> 19:43.041
OLD MAN FIGHT CLUB?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.583
OH, YEAH.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.041
WENDELL WAS
THE RINGLEADER, TOO.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.083
KNOCKED THE HELL
OUT OF HIS FRIEND,

19:49.125 --> 19:51.166
WHO'S ACTUALLY NOT DOING
TOO WELL NOW.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.041
WELL, IT'S AMAZING

19:53.083 --> 19:56.041
WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO
TO ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES.
YEAH. COME HERE.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.542
WHAT? OH.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.166
OOH. OOH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:00.208 --> 20:03.041
HMM? I'M JUST
ENTERTAINING MYSELF.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.041
AND YOU.
TRYING AT LEAST.
NO.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.417
COME HERE.
NO.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.333
SHH, SHH, SHH.
SAM, NO, NO.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.250
WHAT?

20:10.291 --> 20:12.000
NO.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.041
I'M NOT GONNA BE YOUR...
SECRET LOVER.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.875
OH, COME ON, NAOMI.

20:19.917 --> 20:24.000
YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO SPICE THINGS UP

20:24.041 --> 20:27.250
NOW THAT WE'RE...
WHATEVER WE ARE?

20:27.291 --> 20:29.250
OKAY, EVERYBODY AROUND HERE,

20:29.291 --> 20:31.208
THEY ALREADY WENT THROUGH
OUR DIVORCE.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.291
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO DRAG THEM
THROUGH EVERY LITTLE DETAIL NOW?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.083
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THEM.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.083
THIS IS ABOUT THINGS
BEING DIFFERENT

20:38.125 --> 20:41.041
THE SECOND TIME AROUND...

20:41.083 --> 20:45.041
IF THERE IS
A SECOND TIME AROUND.

20:45.083 --> 20:49.375
I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT
JUST GONNA GIVE UP THIS TIME.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.375
OH.
FORGET IT. I--

20:51.417 --> 20:54.041
I GOTTA GO. I-I HAVE TO GET--
WAIT, LISTEN.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.041
I HAVE A PATIENT.
NAOMI, WAIT.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.834
NAOMI, UH...

20:58.875 --> 21:01.458
YOUR PATIENT'S HERE.
YEAH, I KNOW.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.125
YEAH. YEAH.

21:03.166 --> 21:06.792
OH, UH, DELL, LISTEN,
I WAS LOOKING OVER

21:06.834 --> 21:09.417
SOME OF THESE MEDICAL REPORTS
FROM THE NURSING HOME--

21:09.458 --> 21:11.333
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

21:11.375 --> 21:13.083
EXCUSE ME?

21:13.125 --> 21:14.959
YOU HEARD ME.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.041
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.458
NO. IT IS, OKAY?
NO, IT'S NOT.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.417
DELL, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
UPSET ABOUT WENDELL--

21:21.458 --> 21:23.959
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIM, OKAY?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.291
EVERY TIME SHE WALKS AWAY
FROM YOU, SHE'S MISERABLE.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.041
AND I CARE ABOUT HOW
SHE FEELS, OKAY? I CARE.
DELL--

21:29.083 --> 21:31.041
NO, I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK,

21:31.083 --> 21:33.041
BUT THIS ISN'T
JUST A CRUSH, OKAY?

21:33.083 --> 21:35.375
MAYBE AFTER SO MANY YEARS,
YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT.

21:35.417 --> 21:38.041
YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN THINK
LIKE AND--AND LOOK LIKE THAT

21:38.083 --> 21:40.166
AND LAUGH LIKE THAT
AND CARE?

21:40.208 --> 21:42.166
ONE.
SO FAR I'VE MET ONE.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.667
AND YEAH, SHE'S--SHE'S OUT OF
MY LEAGUE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY,

21:44.709 --> 21:46.333
BUT I DON'T CARE.
SHE DAZZLES ME.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.375
AND I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH
TO HOPE THAT ONE DAY I'LL MEET

21:49.417 --> 21:51.875
SOMEONE LIKE HER WHEN THE TIME
IS RIGHT, BECAUSE I WON'T.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.542
I LOVE HER. OKAY?

21:53.583 --> 21:56.792
AND I GUARANTEE YOU
I WOULDN'T MAKE HER CRY.

21:56.834 --> 21:59.291
OKAY, UH... DELL,
I KNOW THAT

21:59.333 --> 22:01.750
YOU'RE UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS RIGHT NOW,

22:01.792 --> 22:04.333
SO I'M GONNA PRETEND

22:04.375 --> 22:08.792
YOU DIDN'T JUST SAY
THOSE THINGS ABOUT MY WIFE.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.500
EX-WIFE.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.208
UH, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW,

22:20.250 --> 22:23.709
I'M GONNA DO MY JOB,
BUT I'M DONE WITH DELL.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.709
WHAT--HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:25.750 --> 22:29.041
DELL IS A...
DELL'S A CHILD.

22:29.083 --> 22:31.333
SAM, WILL YOU CUT HIM
A BREAK?

22:31.375 --> 22:33.041
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.792
I'M CUTTING HIM A BREAK...

22:35.834 --> 22:39.000
A BIG DAMN BREAK.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.041
WE PUT A LOCK
ON THE BASEMENT DOOR.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.041
THEY WERE TAKING BETS.
OKAY.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.041
THE WINNER WOULD WALK AROUND
ALL PUFFED UP.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.417
IT'S...
WHAT A THING, HUH?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.125
G-49.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.166
(people murmuring)

23:02.875 --> 23:05.417
HEY, PA PA.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.875
NATE?

23:09.917 --> 23:11.458
UH, THE SAME.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.041
THE DOCTORS PUT
A PACEMAKER IN.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.709
YOU SHOULDN'T
BLAME YOURSELF.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.709
HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO FIGHT YOU.

23:18.750 --> 23:22.500
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

23:27.458 --> 23:28.458
HEY.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.041
STILL NO CLICK.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.041
WHERE'S GEOFFREY?
ON HIS WAY.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.041
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T
GONE OVER THESE GUYS

23:35.083 --> 23:37.041
A MILLION TIMES.
HMM.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.417
HEY.
HEY, I THINK
I'VE SOLVED OUR PROBLEM.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.291
I HAVE FOUND
THE PERFECT DONOR.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.458
YOU--MARK.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.750
DR. MONTGOMERY, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY BROTHER.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.041
YOUR BROTHER?

23:48.083 --> 23:50.542
HEY, YEAH.
LET'S MAKE A KID.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.625
(chuckles)

23:52.667 --> 23:55.041
(Charlotte) SO IT'S TRUE.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.750
I HAD TO SEE IT
FOR MYSELF.

23:59.792 --> 24:03.041
YOU STOLE MY DADS.
YOU TOOK MY CLASS ROSTER.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.041
I JUST HAD TO REFUND
$27,000.

24:05.083 --> 24:08.041
YOU KNOW HOW THAT LOOKS
FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF?

24:08.083 --> 24:10.291
SEE HOW IT FEELS
TO BE SOMEONE'S BITCH?

24:10.333 --> 24:13.041
I SEE.
THIS IS A GAME TO YOU.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.917
OH, AND IT'S NOT FOR YOU?
COME ON.

24:15.959 --> 24:18.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE OFF FOR TONIGHT.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.208
GAME OVER.

24:21.959 --> 24:25.041
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CLOSE,
BUT CATHLEEN SAID HERSELF,

24:25.083 --> 24:27.041
SHE DOESN'T SETTLE.

24:27.083 --> 24:30.166
SHE HAS HER IDEA
OF WHAT SHE WANTS.
AND I'M THE NEXT BEST THING
TO BEING THERE.

24:30.208 --> 24:33.041
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THIS, MARK?

24:33.083 --> 24:35.041
I MEAN, YOU'D BE MAKING
A CHILD.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.041
WHOA.
I'M NOT HAVING THE BABY.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.041
I'M JUST GONNA BE DOING
THE UNCLE THING.

24:39.083 --> 24:42.041
IT--IT SOUNDS SIMPLE NOW,
BUT SOMETIMES

24:42.083 --> 24:44.041
DONATIONS FROM
FAMILY MEMBERS CAN...
IT GETS--

24:44.083 --> 24:46.041
BE--
IT GETS COMPLICATED.

24:46.083 --> 24:47.917
YEAH.
WELL, MARK'S NOT COMPLICATED.

24:47.959 --> 24:49.667
I'M NOT COMPLICATED.

24:49.709 --> 24:53.709
I MEAN, HE WON'T
THINK TWICE ABOUT THIS.
YOU WON'T?

24:53.750 --> 24:56.750
NOPE. I PROBABLY HAVE
A FEW KIDS OUT THERE

24:56.792 --> 24:58.750
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALREADY.

24:58.792 --> 25:00.583
(laughs) IT'S A JOKE.
(laughter)

25:00.625 --> 25:02.125
IT'S PROBABLY A JOKE.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.583
THIS--THIS IS GOOD,
RIGHT?

25:03.625 --> 25:05.583
I MEAN,
MAYBE NOT US EXACTLY,

25:05.625 --> 25:08.542
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,

25:08.583 --> 25:10.375
I'LL BE IN THE MIX.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.834
YES. IT'S JUST A LITTLE--

25:11.875 --> 25:14.500
I-I KNOW, AND--AND WE DON'T
HAVE TO AT ALL.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.834
IT'S JUST...

25:16.875 --> 25:18.834
NO. I WANT TO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.000
YOU'LL BE IN THE MIX,
AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.417
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH,
DR. MONTGOMERY?

25:27.458 --> 25:29.417
NOT LATELY.
DID YOU ASK AT RECEPTION?

25:29.458 --> 25:31.417
(sighs) YEAH.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.417
HEY.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.000
YOU'RE BACK.

25:34.041 --> 25:35.792
YEAH.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.875
AND YOU MET, UH, PETE.
MY FRIEND.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.375
KEVIN NELSON. HI.

25:41.417 --> 25:44.041
I CAME TO PICK UP
MY MEDICAL REPORT...

25:44.083 --> 25:45.667
FOR WORK.
UH-HUH.

25:45.709 --> 25:48.041
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN JUST
E-MAIL THAT TO YOU.

25:48.083 --> 25:50.792
(clears throat)

25:50.834 --> 25:52.834
(laughs)

25:52.875 --> 25:56.625
THEY CAN KIND OF...
E-MAIL YOU.

25:56.667 --> 26:00.041
OKAY. UH, I THOUGHT
I MIGHT SEE YOU AND...

26:00.083 --> 26:03.041
(police radio chatter)

26:03.083 --> 26:05.250
UH...

26:05.291 --> 26:07.291
MM.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.792
I'VE GOTTA TAKE THIS.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.875
OKAY. IT WAS NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

26:10.917 --> 26:13.959
2-1-3 RESPONDING.

26:19.083 --> 26:20.834
PLEASE.

26:20.875 --> 26:23.041
LOOK, I WON'T BE
A DISTURBANCE.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.917
AND IF YOU CAN, UH,
JUST TALK INTO THE MIKE.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.208
(chuckles)

26:28.250 --> 26:30.583
YEAH, NO. SORRY, DUDE.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.625
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO TELL JACK?

26:32.667 --> 26:34.041
HE'LL FIRE ME.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.959
LOOK, AND AFTER ALL THOSE
PRENATAL CLASSES WITH HIS WIFE

26:37.000 --> 26:39.709
AND DECORATING THE NURSERY,
I JUST--
HEY, HOW ABOUT
I TELL HIM SOMETHING?

26:39.750 --> 26:42.875
NO, DON'T.
YOUR WIFE IS ABOUT TO HAVE
A BABY, JACK.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.500
SO PUT DOWN THE BlackBerry,

26:44.542 --> 26:46.750
STOP SENDING ADAM
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK

26:46.792 --> 26:49.041
AND GET OVER HERE.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.750
GOT THAT, JACKASS?

26:54.166 --> 26:56.875
OKAY, USING A SPECULUM,

26:56.917 --> 26:59.041
I'M GOING TO INSERT
A CATHETER

26:59.083 --> 27:00.792
INTO YOUR UTERUS,

27:00.834 --> 27:02.834
WHERE THE SPERM
WILL BE RELEASED.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.542
MARK'S STUFF--

27:04.583 --> 27:07.250
IT WAS REALLY OKAY?
OH, YEAH, IT WAS EXCELLENT.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.041
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF LITTLE GUYS.

27:09.083 --> 27:13.875
SO WITH ANY LUCK, THE "STUFF"
WILL SWIM RIGHT TO YOUR EGG,

27:13.917 --> 27:16.917
AND PRESTO--
YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EMBRYO.

27:16.959 --> 27:17.667
YAY.

27:17.709 --> 27:19.166
ALL RIGHT.

27:19.208 --> 27:22.667
AND HERE WE GO.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.792
NO!
NO!

27:23.834 --> 27:27.667
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T HAVE MARK INSIDE ME,

27:27.709 --> 27:29.667
THIS BROTHER SPERM TRAVELING
TO MY UTERUS.

27:29.709 --> 27:31.041
I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.875
HONESTLY,
I LOVE YOUR BROTHER, BUT--
HE'S KIND OF A JERK.

27:33.917 --> 27:37.333
HE'S KIND OF A JERK.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SUGGEST THIS?

27:37.375 --> 27:39.375
I'M TRYING HERE, OKAY?
I JUST--
(Addison) LISTEN,
BOTH OF YOU,

27:39.417 --> 27:41.750
THIS ISN'T RIGHT FOR YOU,
AND THAT'S OKAY.

27:41.792 --> 27:43.959
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY'S BABY
BUT YOURS.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.625
I'M SORRY.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.959
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.041
JUST GIVE UP,
NOT HAVE A KID?

27:50.083 --> 27:53.041
I JUST CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.041
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.750
PLEASE.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.083
PLEASE...

27:58.125 --> 28:00.041
HELP US MAKE OUR BABY.

28:06.959 --> 28:08.208
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT
THE BROTHER WAS OUR SOLUTION.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.208
NO, THEY WERE RIGHT.
HE'S A JERK.

28:10.250 --> 28:13.250
I WAS MOMENTARILY ATTRACTED
TO HIM, SO HE MUST BE.
(laughs)

28:13.291 --> 28:16.041
THE SWEET BROTHER
CAN'T MAKE BABIES.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.041
WHAT DOES THAT SAY
ABOUT NATURAL SELECTION?

28:18.083 --> 28:20.041
(sighs) WHAT WERE
HIS LEVELS AGAIN?

28:20.083 --> 28:22.667
UH, F.S.H. AND PROLACTIN
WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

INTO CATHLEEN'S EGGS

31:53.208 --> 31:56.166

YOU CAN DO THAT?

31:56.208 --> 31:58.166
