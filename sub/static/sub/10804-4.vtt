00:15.517 --> 00:17.936
May your neighbors respect you...

00:20.605 --> 00:22.941
trouble neglect you...

00:24.693 --> 00:26.695
the angels protect you...

00:28.655 --> 00:31.866
and heaven accept you. Mmm?

00:31.950 --> 00:33.868
--To better days.

00:33.952 --> 00:35.620
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:36.746 --> 00:39.290
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, who is that guy?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.875
- Easy, lads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.420
Finn.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.673
Caught the first flight soon as I heard.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.300
Yeah...

00:49.383 --> 00:50.885
Terrible circumstances.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.097
But it sure is good to see you.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.515
- Be a good lad.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.310
Go fetch our friend Finn a drink.

01:06.943 --> 01:08.570
It's Rory...

01:10.113 --> 01:11.197
isn't it?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.211
This is him, then?

01:39.475 --> 01:41.811
I didn't want him
to follow my footsteps...

01:42.896 --> 01:45.064
but he insisted.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.942
He came over to make his fortune
and now, look.

01:49.861 --> 01:51.696
Two cents to his name.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.037
He was a good kid, Finn.

02:00.246 --> 02:01.915
And now he's dead.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.230
You know, maybe you've been
out of the game too long to remember.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.195
Death... is part of the deal.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.830
Leave it, leave it.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.550
Holy shit.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.808
Jesus...

03:21.285 --> 03:22.370
Cheers.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.663
Yous all all right, yeah?

03:24.748 --> 03:25.832
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

03:25.915 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.627
Now, this bloody shooter,

03:29.710 --> 03:33.089
he stole $1.2 million of my money.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.759
Man takes my son.
I lose a boy.

03:36.843 --> 03:39.637
He takes my money.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.765
I'm getting it back.

03:41.848 --> 03:43.349
We will beat every mother's son
in this city

03:43.432 --> 03:45.101
till I have my money in my hands,

03:45.184 --> 03:48.772
and this shooter's on his knees, alive.

03:48.855 --> 03:52.066
Or there'll be more of you
shining the inside of a box!

03:56.821 --> 03:58.406
Do you hear me?

03:58.489 --> 03:59.824
--Get out!

03:59.908 --> 04:02.368
- Get out! Move! Let's go!

04:06.622 --> 04:09.083
That bastard shooter
that massacred our brothers.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.709
-Where is he?
-I don't know!

04:14.547 --> 04:16.132
New faces.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.217
Military training.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.261
-Think fast!
-I don't know! Wait, wait!

04:20.344 --> 04:22.430
Wait! I might have seen one guy!

04:23.681 --> 04:27.601
Hey, excuse me! Yeah, you.
How's it going, huh?

04:27.685 --> 04:30.479
- Oh, Jesus.
- You having a good day?

04:31.564 --> 04:32.982
- We're looking for a customer.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.193
-What?
-Wears a jacket...

04:35.276 --> 04:37.736
even in the middle of summer,
or so they say.

04:37.821 --> 04:39.823
I... I mean...

04:42.533 --> 04:46.162
Now, I count two ankles,
two knees, one elbow.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.414
And guess what?
I got five more rounds.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.916
I don't...

04:49.999 --> 04:52.043
I think I know.
Has a dog, right?

04:52.126 --> 04:55.379
Came in here.
I even saw him walk it once.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.173
Elaborate.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.970
--Aw.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.347
Sit.

05:05.431 --> 05:06.975
Search the closets.

05:07.058 --> 05:08.767
Dog's one of ours.
This is the place.

05:08.852 --> 05:11.229
- Nah, it's empty.
- Find my goddamn money.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.356
You heard him.
Let's go!

05:18.111 --> 05:20.196
He's not one for fancy living, is he?

05:20.279 --> 05:22.115
- Pull that up.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.449
Shut that damn dog up!

05:23.532 --> 05:26.202
- Hey! Knock it off!

05:26.285 --> 05:28.787
Uh, nothing...
but it ain't money.

05:28.872 --> 05:30.539
The money's not here.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.465
That's who you are.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.886
Move it.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.487
-Hi.
-Hey.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.531
-I'm just about ready.
-Okay.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.335
-Uh, here, let me help with that.
-Oh, thanks.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.753
- It's okay.
- Oh.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.671
--Sorry.

07:48.011 --> 07:50.346
-You okay?
-Yeah.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.268
I'm just, uh...

07:55.351 --> 07:58.229
recovering.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.773
From what?

08:03.276 --> 08:05.903
I don't really know the name for it.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.864
But... you're feeling better?

08:10.074 --> 08:11.159
Yeah.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.286
Now.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.830
With you.

08:24.005 --> 08:26.924
Not that I can verify,
but you seem good at this.

08:29.260 --> 08:32.638
Uh, well, my brother wasn't,
so that's where I came in.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.931
You never said you had a brother.

08:35.099 --> 08:36.975
Uh... you never asked.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.359
-Uh, thank you.
-Mmm.

08:45.443 --> 08:47.486
Come on. It's about time.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.119
"Precious in the eyes
of the Lord...

08:56.329 --> 08:58.331
is the death of his saints."

09:01.250 --> 09:02.460
Well...

09:03.961 --> 09:06.004
Elliot Grote was no saint.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.799
He was human...

09:11.302 --> 09:12.678
deeply flawed.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.641
Every Sunday,
for as far as I remember...

09:20.018 --> 09:22.020
Elliot would come here...

09:23.522 --> 09:25.316
friendless and alone...

09:25.399 --> 09:26.692
to sit.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.363
right there in that pew.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.950
Often, I would see him take...

09:35.033 --> 09:37.536
whatever money he had...

09:37.620 --> 09:41.082
crumpled one hundreds, loose change...

09:42.250 --> 09:44.252
a Rolex watch one time...

09:46.087 --> 09:49.715
and put it in the collection plate...

09:51.425 --> 09:53.177
hoping for redemption.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.265
Which would never come.

09:58.224 --> 09:59.642
Praying for the light...

10:00.851 --> 10:04.480
but Elliot died still in the dark...

10:05.606 --> 10:07.691
with no one to mourn his loss...

10:09.067 --> 10:10.278
except the three of you.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.157
And so, we might say...

10:15.658 --> 10:17.951
one life gone...

10:18.035 --> 10:20.579
one sinful life...

10:22.790 --> 10:25.543
but one person is not just one person.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.380
In each of us,
there is a world...

10:31.089 --> 10:34.135
webbing out, reaching others.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.806
Creating reactions.

10:40.141 --> 10:41.642
Sometimes equal...

10:43.269 --> 10:45.020
sometimes opposite.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.776
We rush to say, one life gone...

10:53.196 --> 10:55.448
but each of us is a world.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.824
And today,

10:57.908 --> 11:00.828
a world has been lost.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.540
We didn't know him well, but I...

11:04.623 --> 11:07.710
never loved the idea of letting
anyone die alone.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.212
He... He wasn't alone?

11:10.213 --> 11:14.217
They found him surrounded by
knocked out Dogs of Hell, right?

11:14.300 --> 11:16.719
I get all the bad guys
confused these days.

11:16.802 --> 11:20.764
Didn't think it could get much worse
out there, the violence, but...

11:20.848 --> 11:24.268
What if I meet you back at the office?
I'm just gonna take a minute here.

11:24.352 --> 11:25.728
Yeah, sure.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.990
-It was a nice sermon.
-Thank you.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.454
Most priests would have found something
kind to say about the man himself, but...

11:43.537 --> 11:45.248
--I said he came to church.

11:45.331 --> 11:50.002
Nothing shines up a halo
faster than a death, Matthew.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.129
But funerals are for the living...

11:53.297 --> 11:55.633
and revising history...

11:55.716 --> 11:58.135
only dilutes the lessons
we should learn from it.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.595
It wasn't my fault.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.140
-What wasn't?
-Grotto's death.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.851
- No one said it was.
- Yeah.

12:07.353 --> 12:10.689
There's a new man in town, he's, uh...

12:10.773 --> 12:12.566
killing people in cold blood.

12:12.650 --> 12:15.778
Yeah, I read about
what happened with the Irish.

12:15.861 --> 12:19.282
Must have been a...
busy couple nights.

12:19.365 --> 12:20.824
Yeah, I did everything I could to...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.078
uh, protect my client.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.248
- That work is done, Matthew.
- Because I failed.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.917
At least you tried.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.378
Well, like you said,
his life had value.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.673
A whole world's been lost
and others are dying one after the other--

12:35.756 --> 12:37.508
Matthew, what are you looking for?

12:40.719 --> 12:42.638
-Forgiveness.
-For what?

12:46.850 --> 12:49.227
Uh... not doing more?

12:49.312 --> 12:51.314
You just said
you did everything you could.

12:52.315 --> 12:55.275
If you're the man I understand you to be,
I'm sure that's true.

12:57.403 --> 12:59.905
Then why do I still feel guilty?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.456
Guilt can be a good thing.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.334
It's the soul's call to action.

13:12.418 --> 13:14.462
The indication that...

13:14.545 --> 13:16.547
something is wrong.

13:17.548 --> 13:18.882
The only way...

13:20.217 --> 13:22.720
to rid your heart of it...

13:22.803 --> 13:26.014
is to correct your mistakes
and keep going...

13:26.098 --> 13:27.725
until amends are made.

13:29.435 --> 13:33.021
I don't know what you didn't do
or what you should have done...

13:34.314 --> 13:35.816
but the guilt...

13:37.443 --> 13:38.777
the guilt...

13:40.779 --> 13:43.491
means your work is not yet finished.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.285
Thank you.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.561
He's lucky to be alive.

14:53.644 --> 14:57.355
This is all of the stuff
that the DA's collecting for her case.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.733
And most of it's about
the Punisher's victims.

14:59.817 --> 15:02.194
The Dogs of Hell, the cartel...

15:02.277 --> 15:04.362
But this was in the middle of it.

15:04.447 --> 15:06.364
Not someone he shot, him.

15:06.449 --> 15:09.785
He's insane.
Maybe he shot himself.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.413
I thought about that,
but at that close of a range...

15:12.496 --> 15:13.997
Yeah, he'd be dead already.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.500
Okay, not to go all tin-foil hat here,

15:16.584 --> 15:19.086
but Tower obviously
slipped this to me for a reason.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.089
What if the Punisher
isn't the worst of it?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.592
What if Reyes is trying
to cover something up?

15:24.675 --> 15:28.762
You think that murderous
psychopath isn't the worst of it?

15:28.846 --> 15:31.932
No. And I think our best shot
at protecting Nelson and Murdock

15:32.015 --> 15:33.559
- is to find him.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.352
It's our best shot
at career suicide...

15:36.103 --> 15:38.355
- or just getting shot.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.569
- Am I insane?
- Nelson and Murdock.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.739
- Matt?
- Sorry, what?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.032
Nothing, just...

15:49.116 --> 15:51.535
Father Lantom's eulogy
really got to me, I guess.

15:51.619 --> 15:53.912
Yeah, he does that.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.330
Mmm, Punisher's a lunatic.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.957
But you care, anyway?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.877
I wouldn't say that, it's more like...

16:01.211 --> 16:03.046
curious.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.133
In between these files and...
and Reyes' obsession

16:06.216 --> 16:10.262
and the fact that humans are a pretty
complicated species to begin with,

16:10.345 --> 16:11.930
I just...

16:12.014 --> 16:14.432
I feel like there's gotta be
more to the story.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.854
- I think you are...

16:20.438 --> 16:23.526
- Oh, my God, you think I'm insane.

16:23.609 --> 16:26.153
--I'm kidding.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.530
Compassionate.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.910
-Hmm.
-It's a good quality, Karen.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.286
Stuff of saints.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.039
Yeah, well, I'm no saint.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.457
I can't tell you
how glad I am to hear that.

16:41.877 --> 16:42.878
Matt!

16:44.046 --> 16:47.883
We have real, live,
non-criminal clients who need our help.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.636
-Excuse me for a second.
-Yeah.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.561
Tell me.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.354
Mr. DiPesta defaced the elevator
in his building.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.023
Which, technically,
makes him a criminal.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.944
That's what his slumlord, excuse me,
landlord says, but look.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.905
He's got no AC,
no hot water.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.157
This has Nelson and Murdock
written all over it.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.659
But we gotta file today.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.285
Karen!

17:24.002 --> 17:26.338
-Maybe she stepped out.
-Did she take the files?

17:26.421 --> 17:27.631
-Huh?
-From Reyes.

17:27.715 --> 17:28.799
The... the Punisher files.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.258
Oh, shit.

17:33.762 --> 17:34.763
I have to find her.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.474
- Find him first.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.740
You're early.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.159
You know
I don't like being rushed.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.163
-I need the suit, Melvin.
-Yeah, I figured.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.422
You know, you getting popped in the noggin

18:09.506 --> 18:13.010
gave me a chance to try some new stuff
and I'm pretty excited about it.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.223
Fortified, carbon tube helmet.

18:18.306 --> 18:21.143
I mean, it's pretty damn close
to indestructible.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.896
-How close?
-I'll leave the testing to you.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.189
I threw in some reinforced alloy gloves.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.151
You know, what the hell.
Gotta be careful.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.569
Some new people
spilling a lot of blood out there.

18:31.654 --> 18:32.655
Who?

18:32.738 --> 18:34.114
Don't know.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.909
But all my old contacts are showing up
again begging me to outfit 'em.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.494
Did you?

18:40.537 --> 18:43.581
No, I don't do that anymore.
I turned them all away.

18:47.670 --> 18:50.255
-Oh, you look better.
-Yeah, I feel better.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.257
Glad you're on the mend.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.634
So am I.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.679
Well, stay safe out there,
will you?

18:56.762 --> 18:58.806
Thanks, Melvin. You too.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.224
Oh, I'm not taking any chances.
Check this out.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.643
Huh?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.561
Gotta stay strong for Betsy.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.191
You wanna take a look?
I mean, it's pretty wicked.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.319
I'm gonna take your word for it.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.247
Uh, George Buck?

19:26.374 --> 19:29.211
Hi, the hospital told me
I might find you here.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.840
Hi, uh... are you one of them?

19:32.923 --> 19:35.175
Sorry, one of who?

19:35.258 --> 19:36.259
Please, just leave me alone.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.345
I'm not gonna
do anything to you.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.181
If anything, I'd like to help
you get your job back.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.768
Look, I need to understand why you were

19:44.852 --> 19:47.229
fired from Metro-General
in the first place.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.567
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

19:53.736 --> 19:56.071
You were with him when this was taken?

19:56.154 --> 19:58.782
Yeah. That bullet tore through his head.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.828
Not many people survive that.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.580
Well, I'd like to know
what you remember.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.750
John Doe.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.542
Guy was a total vegetable.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.295
I guess that's why they decided
he only needed one nurse.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.422
Any family or visitors?

20:14.506 --> 20:15.758
No.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.009
I mean...

20:17.092 --> 20:18.802
aside from the suits.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.553
-Suits?
-Yeah.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.599
Uh, sometimes men,
sometimes women.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.394
You can tell 'em 'cause
they all wear the same ear pieces.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.313
That and the... black suits.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.150
- Kind of like... uh...

20:34.484 --> 20:36.153
Got any idea who these suits were?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.780
No.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.614
Uh, but they had their run of the place

20:39.697 --> 20:42.910
and they were the ones
that pushed for the, uh, the DNR.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.078
-A "do not resuscitate"?
-Yeah.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.205
They had the paperwork.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.332
And I was there when the doctor
pulled the plug.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.752
I... I'm confused.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.171
You're saying this guy died?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.506
Yeah, for about a minute.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.427
It's crazy, but they say
it happens sometimes.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.764
You know, one minute,
flatline, then boom.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.849
His heart starts back up again.

21:06.892 --> 21:07.935
On its own.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.396
He just didn't wanna die.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.690
Within ten minutes of being awake...

21:14.691 --> 21:17.152
he reaches up
and grabs my scrubs,

21:17.235 --> 21:20.864
yanks me down,
and says, real close...

21:21.990 --> 21:25.160
"Take me home."

21:26.494 --> 21:27.579
I shouldn't have done it.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.748
I shouldn't have done it.
I should've known it'd get me fired.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.294
His home.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.755
Do you have an address?

22:46.533 --> 22:47.742
Nice night.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.541
I'm not alone.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.130
You wanna come with us?

23:01.631 --> 23:03.758
Or you wanna make a mess?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.817
Don't shoot!

23:20.900 --> 23:22.235
We want him alive!

23:23.987 --> 23:25.447
Who, who needs me alive?

23:25.530 --> 23:27.115
- Drop it! Drop it!
- Drop it!

23:27.199 --> 23:29.617
Calm down! Everyone, calm down!
No one shoot!

23:42.714 --> 23:44.882
Well, thanks
for thinning out the herd.

23:48.095 --> 23:49.721
You're surrounded, son.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.350
Now be a good lad and drop the iron.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.106
Come on.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.399
You seem like a smart one.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.019
-Tell Carter we're about done here.
-Got it.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.812
We're finishing up the murder scene
at Stanley's bar. Over.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.814
- Copy.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.139
I need to know
what happened here.

25:14.222 --> 25:16.516
I'm not telling you shit.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.436
You helped us catch Fisk,
that don't make us friends.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.855
Was this the Punisher?

25:24.191 --> 25:25.400
Jesus.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.818
The Irish, okay?

25:26.901 --> 25:29.529
To find the Punisher.
They put a bounty on his head.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.240
Now people all over the Kitchen
are getting hurt.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.159
It's the goddamn Wild West out there.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.035
Have the Irish found him?

25:36.119 --> 25:38.455
As long as we keep getting
calls like this, I guess not.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.459
Hey, stay out of it.
You hear me?

25:42.542 --> 25:45.545
-I just wanna help, Sergeant.
-No, you can't help.

25:45.628 --> 25:49.132
You're the problem!
'Cause of you, the uniform means dick.

25:49.216 --> 25:52.510
Cops are no longer preventing crime,
we're just chasing it.

25:52.594 --> 25:55.180
Mopping up the mess
that you people leave in your wake.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.515
We're on the same side,
you and I.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.434
You're on your own side.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.147
2-Adam, shots fired.
65th Street transverse, by the carousel.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.690
All units to back.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.818
Fifteen Sergeant responding, Central.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.374
Who did this?

27:47.417 --> 27:49.836
People you don't mess with.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.257
You're bleeding out.
And I got all night.

27:54.341 --> 27:55.425
Go to hell!

27:59.221 --> 28:01.138
Who did it?

28:02.265 --> 28:04.601
The one they call Punisher.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.853
- Where is he?

28:08.104 --> 28:10.857
It doesn't matter
'cause when we're done with him,

28:10.940 --> 28:12.484
he's as good as dead.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.153
- That's helpful.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.031
- But it's not what I asked.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.891
You're quite an artist
with the AK, aren't ya?

28:50.730 --> 28:51.773
Nesbitt.

28:52.774 --> 28:53.858
Kelly...

28:55.735 --> 28:57.487
my oldest boy.

28:59.406 --> 29:02.158
Every one gone to the angels
because of you.

29:05.328 --> 29:06.663
You're dying tonight.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.790
The hole's been dug.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.583
But I'm giving you one chance
to meet your maker

29:10.667 --> 29:12.669
with arms and legs attached.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.673
Generosity's my defining trait.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.406
You care for a nibble?

29:41.989 --> 29:43.491
--No?

29:44.576 --> 29:45.993
Ah, suit yourself.

29:56.338 --> 29:58.214
Helps calm me nerves.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.758
I look nervous to you?

30:04.220 --> 30:05.305
Boys.

30:06.306 --> 30:07.640
Give us a moment.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.290
I want my money back.

30:35.126 --> 30:39.296
Your kid's in a box,
but you want your money. Huh?

30:49.223 --> 30:51.643
--The Irish may not have invented revenge,

30:51.726 --> 30:54.270
but we sure as hell
took some time perfecting it.

30:55.813 --> 30:58.525
Don't think you're showing me something
I haven't seen before,

30:58.608 --> 31:00.026
'cause your killing spree

31:00.109 --> 31:03.112
has all the signs
of a man seeking retribution.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.157
Am I right?

31:07.283 --> 31:08.410
Okay.

31:11.829 --> 31:12.872
Okay.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.500
I'll tell you...

31:17.502 --> 31:19.170
I'll tell you where your money is.

31:19.253 --> 31:21.798
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.509
I promise you, it'll be over soon.

31:25.552 --> 31:26.553
In a jiffy.

31:26.636 --> 31:28.471
Come on, yeah?

31:30.598 --> 31:32.809
- How'd that feel?

31:32.892 --> 31:34.310
Boys, hold him down!

31:34.394 --> 31:35.645
Hey...

31:40.232 --> 31:42.610
Come on! Come on!

31:47.490 --> 31:49.366
Oh, I was hoping
it would come to this.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.660
Yeah?

31:50.743 --> 31:52.995
You gonna do it
or you gonna talk about it?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.414
I'm here!

31:54.497 --> 31:58.250
I'll kill every one of you bastards!
Come on, I'll kill you!

32:00.127 --> 32:02.964
Where would you like it?
Here, huh? Here?

32:07.677 --> 32:09.554
Not such a big man now,
are ya?

34:37.785 --> 34:39.954
--What was that?

34:50.047 --> 34:51.257
Murph?

34:53.384 --> 34:54.594
Murph?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.598
-Take that side.
-All right.

34:58.681 --> 34:59.932
-Keep eyes on.
-All right.

35:14.697 --> 35:15.907
All right.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.117
New plan.

35:20.411 --> 35:21.578
Bring him in.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.545
Hey...

35:29.629 --> 35:32.423
It seems like you've taken
a liking to this mutt.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.720
Good boy, good boy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.222
Hey, if I don't get my money...

35:41.265 --> 35:43.184
everything I've done to you,

35:43.267 --> 35:46.646
I'm doing double to poor Fido here, huh?

35:50.399 --> 35:51.776
Huh...

35:51.859 --> 35:54.195
Good boy, good boy, huh.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.491
Wait, wait, wait.

36:05.122 --> 36:08.542
Hey, let him go,
just let him go, you asshole.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.837
I'll tell you where your money is, okay?
I'll tell you.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.715
Your money's in a van, okay?
It's in a van.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.216
It's on 48th and 10th.

36:16.425 --> 36:17.885
Just let him...

36:17.969 --> 36:20.471
Just let him go,
you asshole, let him go.

36:20.554 --> 36:23.515
He's an animal lover.
That's sweet.

36:23.599 --> 36:24.809
Take him out.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.314
Come on, let's go.

36:31.983 --> 36:33.067
Now, if you don't mind...

36:37.654 --> 36:40.407
I'll keep you alive
until the cash is safe at hand.

36:40.491 --> 36:41.492
Yeah?

36:48.624 --> 36:51.168
--48th and 10th.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.503
Yeah, make it quick.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.546
And watch your backside.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.689
--Get him.

37:22.158 --> 37:23.325
Yeah,
I think it went well.

37:23.409 --> 37:26.453
- Yeah, it's the same old story.
- I know, I know. I hear ya.

37:26.537 --> 37:29.206
-What are you gonna do about it, right?
-Ah, nothing.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.050
Yeah.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.384
Yeah, I got the case.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.803
Hold on.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.823
Yeah, the money's all here, Mr. Finn.

38:01.906 --> 38:03.157
Wait, wait, there's something else.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.207
Son of a bitch.

38:19.841 --> 38:22.301
He's loose.
Get down here.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.013
Jimmy! Shaun!

38:27.473 --> 38:28.933
Jimmy!

38:32.353 --> 38:33.813
Jimmy! Shaun!

38:41.237 --> 38:42.529
You wanted this.

38:43.239 --> 38:45.199
No, I counted on it.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.618
Now I can ask you face to face.

38:47.701 --> 38:51.038
Who was there that day?
Who killed my family?

38:51.122 --> 38:53.290
-Your family?
-Yeah.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.583
- Who cares?
- Move!

38:54.666 --> 38:57.128
- Move! Go, go, go!

38:59.213 --> 39:00.547
Shoot that son of a bitch!

39:09.348 --> 39:10.892
- We got him! Come on!
- Yeah!

39:10.975 --> 39:14.020
- Get down here!
- One batch, two batch.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.480
Penny and dime.

39:35.249 --> 39:38.710
They're gonna pay.
Every single goddamn one of 'em.

39:38.794 --> 39:39.962
They will.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.798
But not tonight. Move.

39:42.882 --> 39:45.009
There! That room there.

40:14.956 --> 40:17.041
-No killing.
-Altar boy.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.052
All right,
let's get out of here.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.173
Come on.

42:06.442 --> 42:07.984
Hey.

42:10.612 --> 42:11.822
Not bad.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.740
Thanks.

42:15.034 --> 42:16.702
I guess I, uh...

42:17.744 --> 42:19.163
I guess I was wrong.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.165
About?

42:22.416 --> 42:24.043
About you being a pussy.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.087
Don't get all sweet on me now, Frank.

42:32.051 --> 42:33.802
-Help's on the way.
-Nah.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.346
You should go.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.808
I'm past saving.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.935
At least I'd have company, right?

42:44.438 --> 42:46.440
I think I might cash out.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.613
You'd have made a hell of a Marine, Red.

42:55.574 --> 42:56.700
That rhyme.

42:58.619 --> 43:00.829
-What's it mean?
-What'd you say?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.999
-Huh?
-Thing you say.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.210
Right before you pull the trigger.

43:07.211 --> 43:09.004
What do you...

43:09.088 --> 43:10.297
You heard that?

43:11.090 --> 43:12.674
Yeah, I heard it.

43:12.758 --> 43:14.218
What the...

43:17.471 --> 43:19.014
I gotta say, sometimes...

43:20.141 --> 43:22.976
Sometimes I think
you really just might be the devil.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.230
Sometimes I think I might be, too.

43:28.649 --> 43:29.858
It's, uh...

43:31.527 --> 43:33.320
One batch, two batch.

43:34.655 --> 43:36.657
Penny and dime, you know.

43:38.742 --> 43:40.161
It was her favorite book.

43:43.997 --> 43:45.416
You know, you...

43:46.875 --> 43:49.836
You gotta cross the ocean... and go fight.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.004
You see...

43:52.589 --> 43:54.925
whole time you're thinking
you're gonna be scared, right?

43:55.008 --> 43:57.010
But then, you're not.

43:58.345 --> 44:00.431
See, that part of it was
always easy for me.

44:01.432 --> 44:02.558
Killing.

44:03.725 --> 44:06.395
Even watching my buddies die,
it just...

44:06.478 --> 44:07.938
it didn't mean nothing.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.567
The first time I got scared...

44:12.776 --> 44:15.196
was on a plane on the way home.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.659
I kept thinking God was gonna pull the rug
out from under us, you know?

44:20.742 --> 44:22.953
Shit, that's his kind of funny, you know.

44:25.706 --> 44:28.709
But the plane landed safe
and we were home.

44:28.792 --> 44:30.377
Driving through traffic.

44:30.461 --> 44:34.548
Yeah, you pass fast food
and donut shops and all that...

44:34.631 --> 44:35.757
that greasy shit.

44:35.841 --> 44:39.010
It's the shit you fought to protect
and then the car stops.

44:41.472 --> 44:43.640
We were outside her school.

44:43.724 --> 44:45.726
I get to her classroom, right?

44:48.103 --> 44:49.646
She's in there...

44:51.022 --> 44:52.691
but she's got no idea.

44:54.109 --> 44:56.528
She's got no idea that Daddy's home.

44:59.365 --> 45:02.493
I walk in, these kids,
they're not even studying, they're...

45:02.576 --> 45:05.412
doing some kind of yoga. Yeah.

45:05.496 --> 45:07.789
You know?

45:07.873 --> 45:09.082
She's there.

45:10.251 --> 45:11.877
She's doing her poses,
you know.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.797
She's bending and,
you know, she's moving.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.716
She looks like a flower.

45:17.799 --> 45:19.510
Yeah.

45:19.593 --> 45:21.177
And, you know,
you can't even understand it,

45:21.262 --> 45:23.305
you know, how does
something like that have...

45:24.723 --> 45:26.517
How does something that beautiful...

45:27.726 --> 45:28.852
How does that...

45:29.853 --> 45:32.606
does that come from me, you know?

45:34.608 --> 45:36.693
And she looks up and she sees me.

45:39.696 --> 45:40.906
I see her.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.827
By God, that's real.

45:46.995 --> 45:49.039
That's real, Red.

45:49.122 --> 45:50.291
Boom.

45:50.374 --> 45:52.459
In an instant,
she's across that classroom floor,

45:52.543 --> 45:54.210
she's in my arms.

45:56.046 --> 45:59.675
She's squeezing me so tight,
I swear I was gonna bust a rib, you know?

46:01.343 --> 46:03.387
We just stayed there like that,
we're holding each other.

46:03.470 --> 46:06.264
Teacher, she's filming the whole thing
on her phone, you know,

46:06.348 --> 46:09.017
she's gonna put it on
YouTube or some shit.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.103
She can't hold the thing steady,
because, you know, she's...

46:12.187 --> 46:14.815
she's bawling so hard,
and the kids are all wailing,

46:14.898 --> 46:16.149
you know, they're screaming.
And me?

46:16.232 --> 46:18.151
Shit, I'm the worst of all.
I'm a...

46:19.486 --> 46:21.613
I'm a rubber-face clown,
you know.

46:21.697 --> 46:23.281
I cried so hard.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.330
But not my baby.

46:29.413 --> 46:30.831
Not my girl.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.667
You know,
she's my girl. She's...

46:35.836 --> 46:37.963
She's not crying,
she's holding me up.

46:39.715 --> 46:42.300
My girl,
she's keeping me on my feet.

46:46.430 --> 46:50.266
She says,
"I knew it, Daddy. I knew it."

46:52.436 --> 46:55.522
And then we go home.
Wife, the boy.

46:56.523 --> 46:57.691
Place is the exact same.

46:57.774 --> 47:01.528
It's like it was just holding its breath
waiting for me to get back, you know?

47:04.573 --> 47:05.907
Then it hit me.

47:06.867 --> 47:08.869
All of it, you know.

47:10.412 --> 47:14.165
The first time I felt how tired I was,
you know, I was just...

47:15.417 --> 47:17.127
tired, you know?

47:19.963 --> 47:22.007
You...

47:22.090 --> 47:24.092
You ever been tired, Red?

47:26.011 --> 47:27.178
Yeah.

47:27.262 --> 47:28.764
So, you know.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.892
It's just, I couldn't do nothing,
you know?

47:31.975 --> 47:33.602
All the things...

47:37.648 --> 47:39.858
I couldn't take my wife to bed.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.779
Ball with the boy. Shit...

47:43.862 --> 47:47.073
I was too tired, I couldn't even drink
a goddamn beer, you know.

47:48.283 --> 47:49.451
But not her.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.788
My girl was up.

47:52.871 --> 47:55.999
See, she wanted me to, uh...

47:56.082 --> 47:59.252
she wanted me to tuck her in.
She...

47:59.335 --> 48:01.547
She outgrew it, she knew it,
but she didn't care.

48:01.630 --> 48:03.131
She wanted it.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.011
She had that book.

48:11.014 --> 48:13.975
Her favorite book was out on the pillows.

48:14.059 --> 48:18.354
One Batch, Two Batch...
Penny and Dime.

48:18.439 --> 48:19.440
Yeah.

48:20.356 --> 48:22.192
I read her that book every night
before this shit.

48:22.275 --> 48:24.653
I read it every single night,
but, see, that was over now

48:24.736 --> 48:26.738
because Daddy's home now.

48:30.659 --> 48:33.286
She looked at me and she begged me, Red.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.623
She begged.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.292
She begged.

48:44.631 --> 48:46.049
I said, "No.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.389
Daddy's too tired, see.

48:55.517 --> 48:56.810
But I'll...

48:56.893 --> 48:58.895
I'll read to you tomorrow night.

49:00.647 --> 49:04.901
I'll read to you
tomorrow night, I promise." Yeah.

49:08.029 --> 49:09.447
Never think that...

49:10.574 --> 49:13.494
for her there was not gonna be
any tomorrow, see.

49:16.788 --> 49:18.081
The last time I'd see her,

49:18.164 --> 49:21.001
I'd be holding her lifeless body
in my arms.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.256
Meat was spilling out of her, Red.

49:27.591 --> 49:29.593
The place where her face used to be.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.474
Yeah.

49:38.519 --> 49:41.855
I think I'm done... Red.

49:41.938 --> 49:44.315
--I think I'm done.

49:54.743 --> 49:56.369
Police. Don't move.

49:57.913 --> 49:59.122
Hands where I can see 'em.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.249
--Shots fired.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.959
Bodies, mayhem and shit.

50:03.043 --> 50:04.711
How come I just knew it had to be you?

50:04.795 --> 50:06.755
I have something for you, Sergeant.

50:07.714 --> 50:09.174
That's him?

50:10.551 --> 50:12.594
-Cover him and get EMS.
-Yep.

50:12.678 --> 50:16.848
And you,
you incredible pain in my ass.

50:16.932 --> 50:18.183
You're under arrest.

50:18.266 --> 50:19.685
Get him help.

50:19.768 --> 50:20.811
Shut up.

50:20.894 --> 50:23.271
-Take the collar.
-What?

50:23.354 --> 50:24.522
You heard me.

50:25.649 --> 50:27.734
You caught him, not me.

50:27.818 --> 50:29.570
It can't be me,
it has to be you.

50:30.862 --> 50:32.280
Why?

50:32.363 --> 50:34.575
To protect the Kitchen.

50:34.658 --> 50:35.867
For law, for order.

50:36.785 --> 50:38.036
You're telling me
how to file a report now?

50:38.119 --> 50:39.329
Yeah. Take the collar.

50:39.412 --> 50:40.747
Take the credit.
Get a promotion, if you can.

50:40.831 --> 50:41.998
-You've earned it.
-Bullshit.

50:42.082 --> 50:44.292
No, people have to know the system works.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.336
Not his justice and not mine.

50:47.212 --> 50:50.716
Vigilante days are done in this town.
The police are in charge.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.427
That's not how it happened.

50:54.510 --> 50:56.722
Then make it how it happened.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.684
Shit.

51:01.643 --> 51:04.395
EMT and backup on the way.
Two minutes out.

51:05.271 --> 51:06.982
Go.

51:07.065 --> 51:08.149
Go!

51:09.192 --> 51:11.361
I don't know what you are...

51:11.903 --> 51:14.239
- but I know you ain't him.

51:56.865 --> 51:57.949
Frank Castle,

51:58.033 --> 52:00.326
the gunman wanted in connection
with the Metro-General shooting

52:00.410 --> 52:02.913
and linked to dozens
of recent gangland-related killings

52:02.996 --> 52:06.166
throughout Hell's Kitchen
was apprehended just hours ago

52:06.249 --> 52:07.834
outside Saint Michael's Cemetery.

52:07.918 --> 52:11.379
An NYPD spokesman says, "Tonight,
New York has Sergeant Brett Mahoney

52:11.462 --> 52:13.339
of the 15th Precinct to thank."

52:13.423 --> 52:15.383
Gotta hand it to Brett.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.928
I'm glad people like him
are looking out for Hell's Kitchen.

52:18.011 --> 52:19.012
Yeah.

52:19.095 --> 52:21.639
And I'm glad someone
was looking out for him.

52:21.723 --> 52:25.643
Press are calling Castle
"a cold-blooded psychopath."

52:25.727 --> 52:26.853
The DA's gonna have a hell of a time

52:26.937 --> 52:29.189
using his prosecution
to turn herself into a hero.

52:29.272 --> 52:31.274
It's all working out perfectly.

52:31.983 --> 52:34.069
- Wow, way to bring us down.
- I'm...

52:34.152 --> 52:35.987
Hey, Josie,
would you mind turning the TV off?

52:36.071 --> 52:37.572
It's upsetting some of the regulars.

52:39.032 --> 52:41.659
I think we've had enough Punisher
for one evening.

52:41.743 --> 52:43.619
-Hmm. Okay. I'll drink to that.
-All right?

52:43.704 --> 52:47.415
To Brett and... a safe Hell's Kitchen.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.210
- Hear, hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

52:52.420 --> 52:53.421
- Oh.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.131
-I'm gonna get us another round.
-Good.

52:55.215 --> 52:56.549
I hope you two saved room for shots.

52:56.632 --> 52:57.884
- Same again.
- Oh, no, no.

52:57.968 --> 53:00.303
- Oh, shots.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.596
Thanks, Fog.

53:06.977 --> 53:08.186
Hey.

53:09.771 --> 53:10.981
You okay?

53:12.232 --> 53:13.441
Yeah.

53:15.068 --> 53:17.570
- Okay, that wasn't convincing, was it?

53:17.653 --> 53:18.905
Um...

53:19.823 --> 53:22.033
I don't know, I just, uh...

53:23.368 --> 53:25.620
days like today...

53:25.703 --> 53:29.040
remind me how precious life can be,
you know?

53:41.469 --> 53:43.179
What's your brother like?

53:46.557 --> 53:47.809
Um...

53:49.102 --> 53:50.561
Uh, he's sweet. He's...

53:50.645 --> 53:52.272
a good brother.

54:08.204 --> 54:09.747
Careful, Matt.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.042
What's that?

54:12.125 --> 54:15.170
Keep going like this,
you just might end up happy.

54:15.253 --> 54:17.713
And for a Catholic boy,
that's a pretty dangerous thing.

54:19.382 --> 54:21.717
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:21.802 --> 54:23.511
Godspeed, Matt Murdock.

54:23.594 --> 54:24.930
Hey, where next?

54:25.013 --> 54:26.807
Home.

54:26.890 --> 54:28.183
I'm gonna sleep for a week.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.517
Someone had the awful idea of doing shots.

54:30.685 --> 54:33.104
I think I've had enough excitement
for one evening.

54:33.188 --> 54:35.481
-See you two in the morning.
-Okay. Yeah.

54:35.565 --> 54:37.775
- See ya, Fog.
- Bye.

54:50.872 --> 54:52.123
Do you mind the rain?

54:54.250 --> 54:55.710
No.

55:06.096 --> 55:07.931
Then I'll walk you home.

57:08.676 --> 57:10.971
-Can I take you to dinner?
-Yes.

57:13.181 --> 57:15.683
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

57:24.609 --> 57:26.069
Good night, Karen.

57:29.155 --> 57:30.781
Good night, Matt.

58:48.234 --> 58:49.860
Hello, Matthew.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.202
Elektra.
