Candy, you said
you got speakers.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.563
-What is all this?
-Ha-ha!

02:11.599 --> 02:14.533
This, my man, is the whitesnake
a/v package in full.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.301
- Can we afford this?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.303
A guy down at the arena
owed me a huge favour.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.072
Saved his life

Excessive and free.
You get me.

And I got all this,
so now you have to tell me,

02:25.312 --> 02:27.112
Who's the musical guest?
Come on.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.947
Is it celine? Bublé?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.782
On the dl?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.451
The greatest blockbuster ever.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.654
Yeah, except on the dl,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.389
You didn't actually
tell me a thing.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.057
Pham guarantee, baby.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.059
Mom, (unclear), check this out.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.261
Ohh, hot off the press.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.197
How come our pictures
aren't on the pham guarantee?

02:45.199 --> 02:46.532
We don't want that kind of heat.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.466
You know how many guarantees
your dad makes?

02:48.468 --> 02:50.202
It's a lot of liability.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.502
Good point.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.141
Oh, let me photobomb it.
You'll get more likes.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.609
Um, I think I'm okay.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.611
But I will hashtag it
dad's fave.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.147
Khia, great job on the poster.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.015
I'm just a vessel for my art.

Mom, gross.

Hey-o! Ramesh, you ready

03:10.157 --> 03:11.456
I could take it or leave it.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.158
But you are going to get
the cake?

03:13.293 --> 03:14.792
Ah, yes. The cake.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.828
After andrew's
14 texts messages,

03:16.964 --> 03:19.598
And six voicemails,
and two "casual" emails,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.433
Thank god
you're reminding me again.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.235
I'm glad you know.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.836
- I'll be back.
- Thanks, dad.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.141
So, kids, are you ready for
the greatest day of your lives?

03:30.211 --> 03:32.811
What's today?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.480
- Dad, chill.
- You know I'm unable to chill.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.982
- It's the blockbuster, baby!
- I know.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.251
Okay, bring it in.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.655
Pham hands in.

All:
Three, two, one. Phams!

Hudson:
Hey, khia, leo.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.365
Guess who's back.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.535
Oh. Hey, khia.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.403
- Oh! Mannix!
- What up?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.472
Hey, leo. Oh, my god.
You grew, like, a foot.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.474
Nope. Still just got the two.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.409
(laughing) right.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.545
And you, I mean,
your hair got longer.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.481
Oh, yours is too.
It looks great.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.449
Yours looks great also.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.386
So, uh, you just staying
for the summer?

04:14.521 --> 04:17.889
Nope! My baby's moving back in
with her pops, full-time.

04:17.891 --> 04:21.125
Two long years in paris,
but I guess she chose me,

04:21.161 --> 04:24.062
Over her mom, and over paris.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.464
- I mean, I win, lisa.
- Dad!

04:27.768 --> 04:29.100
- Okay, I'll just--
- yeah.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.036
(laughing) sorry.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.174
Well, uh, got to go unpack.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.976
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.277
Yeah.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.514
What was that?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.649
What? Nothing.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.385
Hey, wait for me.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.526
It's all coming together.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.261
You know what?
Life's simple.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.596
You make choices
and you don't look back.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.265
Han, "tokyo drift."

05:03.037 --> 05:07.138
Sorry to interrupt whatever
little grooming ritual this is.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.373
(laughing)

05:08.375 --> 05:09.607
Sneak a line in,
catch the quote,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.276
Get a back scratch.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.811
- That's our thing, barb.
- Camille: What do you want?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.146
Ooh, yeah.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.014
Um, bylaw rules
coming through.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.483
You need a permit
for your little party.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.585
Well, I've got a permit.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.388
Actually, you got
permit 9835f6bq.

05:23.523 --> 05:27.359
What you need
is permit 9835f6br.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.361
So just give us that permit.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.363
Ooh, yeah, actually, we can only
give one 9835f6br

05:32.399 --> 05:34.900
On any given day,
and someone already has it.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.568
So shut it down.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.637
That's outrageous.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.305
You've done nothing
about the hoarders,

05:40.307 --> 05:42.040
And I've called you, like,
50 times.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.776
We are not allowed to tow cars
off private property.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.511
Yet.

05:46.646 --> 05:47.812
Bye!

05:50.684 --> 05:51.850
What are we going to do?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.387
Well, those permits
are public record,

05:55.389 --> 05:57.455
So all we need to do is find
the person who has the permit

05:57.591 --> 05:59.390
And then convince them
if they don't give it to us,

05:59.426 --> 06:00.859
They're crushing
our children's dreams.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.495
- Checkmate, barb.
- I love your brain.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.498
Hey, andrew,

06:06.633 --> 06:09.134
Any interest in a slightly used
aquarium??

06:09.269 --> 06:11.135
No, sebastian, I'm good.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.071
But what about
that special guest of ours?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.339
When's he getting here?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.275
- Oh, you mean drake.
- Shh!

06:17.277 --> 06:18.743
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.412
My drake hook-up
wasn't quite as solid

06:20.547 --> 06:21.880
As I thought.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.415
You thought sebastian
was going to get drake?

06:24.451 --> 06:27.185
Yes! I believe in people.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.622
Sebastian, you said.
"I'm tight with drake."

06:30.624 --> 06:32.256
I was joey jeremiah's stand-in
on "degrassi."

06:32.292 --> 06:33.692
He's a great guy.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.394
Troi, oi!
I guaranteed my kids,

06:36.430 --> 06:38.229
And the entire neighbourhood

06:38.298 --> 06:40.499
The best night
of their lives.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.834
I know. That's on me.
I owe you one drake.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.303
Or perhaps one joey jeremiah.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.704
(laughing)

06:48.142 --> 06:49.774
We could ask jason.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.310
Yo, you think he'd do it?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.446
Aw, he'd be so good.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.181
But he's retired.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.716
I mean, he's a hip-hop legend.
It's worth asking.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.519
Boom!

07:02.623 --> 07:04.055
Miguel gutiérrez.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.556
Those permits will be ours.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.259
Two problems, two of us.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.661
Which one do you want?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.329
Permits...

07:11.465 --> 07:13.532
Or getting a music icon
to perform.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.299
Paperwork...

07:16.603 --> 07:18.670
Or dope beats.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.005
Ugh. Bureaucracy!

07:20.007 --> 07:21.473
Yeah, I'll get the permit.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.074
- Sick! I need backup.
- Okay.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.142
- Love you.
- Oh, don't forget the samosas.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.678
Jason loves them!

07:26.747 --> 07:29.014
Coming for you, gutiérrez.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.417
I'm just saying,
my little girl chose me.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.687
Yeah, man. Chose you over paris.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.489
Hudson:
You think jason will do it?

07:37.491 --> 07:40.025
I don't know,
but he's our last hope.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.129
- Let's get it.
- Time to get dangerous.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.498
- Jason: Who's there?
- Andrew: Kardinal!

07:47.534 --> 07:49.034
It's your boys!

07:49.169 --> 07:50.435
My guys.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.037
Listen, I keep trying
to tell you,

07:52.172 --> 07:55.574
Kardinal offishall
is retired.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.441
It's just jason now.

07:57.478 --> 08:01.913
Ooh, are those
camille's samosas?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.251
Yeah, we just wanted
to talk to you...

08:11.091 --> 08:12.390
(car engine revving)

08:12.459 --> 08:13.758
(ratchets cranking)

08:18.065 --> 08:19.731
The east river car club.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.948
Hey, lady,
you lost or something?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.117
Nope.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.785
I'm looking for a race.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.623
Was I unclear?

08:45.759 --> 08:47.826
I'm looking for a race.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.695
Yeah? You want to race
in that thing?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.597
(all laugh)

08:53.667 --> 08:54.966
Yup.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.501
You miguel?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.637
Miguel gutiérrez,
street king of the east side.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.706
Yeah! Loyalty, baby.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.441
Well, miguel,
you got something I need.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.777
Oh, yeah? What's that?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.445
Your permit.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.014
No can do.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.381
We got a street meetup later,

09:10.417 --> 09:12.183
And that permit lady?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.718
She already shut us down
twice this month.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.086
(scoffing) barb.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.520
We call her
"permiso diablo," huh?

09:16.557 --> 09:19.523
Hey, hey, I know you.
You're that chef.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.693
No, I work in hr,

09:21.828 --> 09:23.661
But, yeah, I do have
a little online food following.

09:23.796 --> 09:24.863
(speaking spanish)

09:26.233 --> 09:28.733
Okay, how about this?

09:28.802 --> 09:32.203
You win the race,
I cook your entire crew

09:32.339 --> 09:33.538
A five-course tasting menu.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.039
And if I win,
I get the permit.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.841
Miguel:
A five-course meal, huh?

09:36.843 --> 09:39.377
Okay, I'll race you.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.612
But it has to be street rules.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.148
Car for car.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.716
- Man: Yeah!
- (group chuckles)

09:44.785 --> 09:46.952
Wait, why would you
want my van?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.786
I have a kid on the way, so...

09:50.123 --> 09:51.589
You're a complex man, miguel.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.027
Okay, deal. Street rules.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.296
But also, street legal.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.632
No speeding.
There are kids around.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.167
(all snicker)

10:02.169 --> 10:03.467
You want to race
without speeding?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.836
You're afraid your little tuner

10:04.971 --> 10:06.203
Can't get up to the speed limit

10:06.239 --> 10:07.438
As fast as van diesel?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.573
All:
Oh!

10:08.642 --> 10:09.908
(all laughing)

in the new car?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.292
- Me!
- Oh, yeah.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.394
Leo: I'm gonna drop that clutch
so hard.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.229
Take it easy, cole trickle.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.866
- Huh?
- "days of thunder"? No one?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.468
You owe me.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.436
Hey, khia, are you coming?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.205
Oh, right.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.007
A few of us were going to go
hang out at mannix's.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.875
But it's okay.
I will go for a ride.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.011
No, no, you should go.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.578
- Have fun with your friends.
- Really?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.181
Yeah. Go on.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.151
Okay. Thank you.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.223
And I'm dying on the inside.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.492
- Are you going to cry again?
- Yeah, I'm going to cry again.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.160
It's okay to cry.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.229
- Hey, I'm still here.
- Andrew: For now.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.231
Ah!

21:10.303 --> 21:11.702
Camille:
You want to drive?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.571
- Leo: Yeah.
- Camille: Okay.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.039
Andrew:
One lap only.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.907
Camille:
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.442
Okay, here.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.243
Andrew:
He sits on your lap.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.850
(eagle crying)

21:25.985 --> 21:28.252
Jason: Mother nature is in pain.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.657
The world is on fire.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.195
This is the soundscape

21:38.330 --> 21:41.932
Of our surroundings.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.500
(imitating bird shrieking)
