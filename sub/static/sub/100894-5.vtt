[Maddie] Glassware: check.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.618
Vases: check.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.872
Chandelier: check!

01:21.372 --> 01:23.166
Skeeter, it's beautiful.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.502
Hope it doesn't get ruined.

01:25.585 --> 01:29.172
Hey, we got enough storm clouds out there.
Don't need you being one too.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.759
Champagne glasses: check.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.179
-Massage chairs...
-Check.

01:36.679 --> 01:39.390
[sighs] Helen! Are you relaxing?

01:39.474 --> 01:40.600
Oh, recharging.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.436
Skeeter will move all this into the salon

01:43.520 --> 01:47.357
after we christen this place
with a very, very special Margarita Night.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.608
Come on. Sit down.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.152
-Rest your weary for five minutes.
-[sighs]

01:51.236 --> 01:52.654
Test the amenities.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.823
I want to be testing Dana Sue's menu.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.282
Where in the world is she?

01:56.366 --> 01:59.035
Wherever she is, she's got it
under control like she always does.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.790
Plus, Skeeter has got the electrical,

02:03.873 --> 02:06.543
the plumbing, and the HVAC all up to code.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.838
Petey will come by tomorrow
for his final inspection.

02:09.921 --> 02:10.922
He will sign off.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.843
[chuckles] And then, we, my dear,
are a go for Saturday.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.386
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes, we are.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.138
The only difficulty is...

02:19.222 --> 02:22.058
I cannot sit here all day
and wait for Petey.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.103
Well, I can wait for him
while I write my speech.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.188
When did you decide
to give a speech on Saturday?

02:27.272 --> 02:30.984
Oh, no, no, no. No. Tomorrow night
at the baseball fundraiser.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.736
You know, "open your hearts
and your wallets."

02:33.820 --> 02:35.321
-Maybe something a little more subtle...
-Subtle.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.199
...but have I had a chance
to work on it? No.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.244
-[Helen] I was getting worried about you.
-[Maddie] Hey.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.620
[Dana Sue sighs]

02:42.704 --> 02:45.331
It is wetter than a submarine
with screen doors out there.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.875
-[Helen] I know.
-[chuckles]

02:46.958 --> 02:53.339
Oh, I can't wait for y'all to try
brie bites... with pecan.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.841
-Mm.
-Erik Whitley,

02:54.924 --> 02:56.342
what he can do with a dough.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.219
-Erik Whitley.
-Yes, please.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.724
And here's to the most important element
of Margarita Night.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.309
That's the three of us, right?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.685
Oh, yeah, that's what I said.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
You take this, you have to drive.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.771
That's right.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.857
-Look.
-[all laugh]

03:10.940 --> 03:13.193
-Give her a lot.
-Thank you.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.528
All right, ladies. Let's pour it out.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.864
-All right.
-[Helen laughs]

03:17.947 --> 03:19.574
As much as I want to enjoy every second,

03:19.657 --> 03:22.160
I will be so happy when this weekend
is finally in the books.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.287
Oh, yeah? Freeing up some time

03:24.370 --> 03:26.289
for a fling with the shirtless wonder?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.208
[Dana Sue laughing]

03:28.291 --> 03:30.877
I don't mean to tease... too much.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.588
No, really, honestly,
it would be daunting.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.799
Not having been intimate with anyone
other than Bill in over 20 years?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.927
-Well, okay.
-[Dana Sue] But, listen, I empathize.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.387
-[Maddie] What about you and Ryan?
-Eh.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.306
Any fling-worthy news to report?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.849
Ryan's out saving the world.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.643
We talk and we text,

03:46.726 --> 03:49.854
but I'm not sure when next
we'll be together long enough

03:49.938 --> 03:51.189
to have a fling.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.273
[Maddie] Mmm.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.108
The marvels of modern technology,

03:54.192 --> 03:57.153
you can still talk
even when he's halfway around the world.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.197
-[phone chiming]
-Mm.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.783
[phone chiming]

04:01.866 --> 04:03.159
[Helen chuckles]

04:03.243 --> 04:04.077
Hey, you.

04:04.160 --> 04:04.994
Oh...

04:05.912 --> 04:08.957
Two blocks away.
He's, like, right across the street.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.212
She what?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.131
She what?

04:17.715 --> 04:20.176
No, thank you. No, I-- I mean that.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.719
Okay, bye.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.679
[scoffs]

04:25.473 --> 04:26.766
If you'll excuse me...

04:28.268 --> 04:30.311
I've gotta go see a girl about a grudge.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.605
[thunder rumbles]

04:32.689 --> 04:33.940
[door opens]

04:37.527 --> 04:40.321
-Ms. Maddie, let me take your umbrella.
-Oh, thank you, Nellie.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.116
-Then I'll tell Mama that you're here.
-Okay, I appreciate that.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.410
I know she's busy,
but I just need a few minutes.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.911
She'll be so glad to take a break.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.872
She gets herself so stressed
when she's entertaining.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.874
Yeah, well,
her parties are always very memorable.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.043
It's super important to her
that everything's perfect.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.381
How's Kyle doing with the play?

04:59.173 --> 05:01.592
They never give parts like that
to freshmen.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.345
I know. He's-- He's pretty excited.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.471
He's so talented.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.057
Will he be at the fundraiser?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.727
He would've been,
but I need his help down at the spa so--

05:10.810 --> 05:11.769
[Mary] Maddie!

05:11.853 --> 05:14.272
You look rode hard and put up wet.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.066
Mary Vaughn.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.195
Nellie, go on and let the adults talk.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.244
I suppose this visit has to do
with our unfortunate scheduling conflict.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.204
An uncanny coincidence, isn't it?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.290
The forecast for tomorrow
calls for terrible rain.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.917
I had no choice but to move
our outdoor baseball gala

05:35.001 --> 05:35.918
to Saturday night.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.046
Opposite our spa opening.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.797
Seems like old times.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.466
I can't imagine what you mean.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.884
Your sweet sixteen?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.012
This has nothing to do with that.
Why would you think it does?

05:46.095 --> 05:47.972
[scoffs]
Because you've never gotten over it,

05:48.389 --> 05:51.017
no matter how many times
we've apologized over the years.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.062
It was an unavoidable scheduling conflict.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.938
-As is this.
-For a good cause.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.482
-As is this.
-[scoffs]

05:57.565 --> 06:00.443
And just as your little hurricane relief 
bake sale had...

06:00.526 --> 06:01.694
Dessert auction,

06:01.778 --> 06:03.488
and it raised over 1000 dollars
for families

06:03.571 --> 06:05.490
-that were displaced by the hurricane.
-...had no effect on my sweet sixteen,

06:05.573 --> 06:09.118
neither will your spa party
have any effect on my fundraiser.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.163
We're sure to draw very different crowds
Saturday night.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.375
Anyone who cares about our boys
will obviously be here.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.251
It's a shame you won't be.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.629
Oh, I'll be here. To help with the set-up.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.423
Doing my part as a Bulldog Booster.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.217
Bless your heart.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.052
Such the busy single mother.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.263
Was there something else
you wanted to discuss?

06:33.643 --> 06:35.812
[Maddie] Look at this ridiculous sunshine.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.940
She did not have to move her party.
It's gonna be clear and dry tonight.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.650
You know what? Chin up, sweet pea.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.404
Last night, Annie helped me do
a social media blast.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.030
-That's right. I blasted.
-Okay.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.032
And we targeted all the women in town.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.118
Not everyone is associated
with the baseball team.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.662
Okay, well,
we've gotta get off to a strong start

06:52.745 --> 06:54.247
because all of our projections,

06:54.330 --> 06:56.374
they will be invalid
and we will be on thin ice, Dana.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.375
-So I'm telling you.
-Okay, listen,

06:57.458 --> 07:00.253
we are not gonna let Mary Vaughn
ruin this, all right--

07:00.336 --> 07:01.462
[Helen] Ma'am!

07:01.546 --> 07:03.172
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, what in Sam Hill...

07:03.256 --> 07:05.675
[Helen] We have an opening tomorrow night!

07:05.758 --> 07:07.677
You gotta get somebody over here to--

07:07.760 --> 07:11.681
Listen, this is a city tree,
so it's a city responsibility.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.350
We've been telling you for weeks
that this was sick!

07:14.725 --> 07:15.685
When?

07:17.311 --> 07:18.146
Yeah.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.106
Fine, thank...

07:21.107 --> 07:22.191
[scoffs]

07:23.067 --> 07:24.193
It was only a matter of time.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.237
What'd they say
about getting this mess outta here?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.197
Oh, they cannot anticipate.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.824
Trees are down all over town,

07:29.907 --> 07:32.285
they've got electrical shortages
and flooding.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.996
Municipal services
are completely overwhelmed.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.457
Petey could be here any minute,
and you know he won't sign off on this.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.374
Maddie.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.461
Well, I'm pretty sure
Ronnie's chainsaw's still in the garage.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.171
So let's get going.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.256
She's gonna chainsaw it.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.341
-Who's gonna chainsaw?
-I'm not chainsawing.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.552
-This could've killed someone.
-My Lord!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.389
Ryan! What're you doing here?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.975
Flew in this morning.
Surprise. Hey, Maddie.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.394
-[Helen] Thank you.
-Figured you might want an escort

07:58.478 --> 08:00.730
to the grand opening, but it looks like
you might need more than that.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.690
Dana Sue just went to get her chainsaw.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.317
-I can help with that.
-Okay.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.652
[chainsaw whirring]

08:10.698 --> 08:12.950
I should be able to have this cleared
in a couple of hours.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.661
-What time is your inspector coming?
-You never know with Petey.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.080
[Skeeter] Well, we lost power, ladies.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.165
Are you kidding me.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.834
Grid problem.
City doesn't know when it can come out.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.753
-[sighs]
-Lord, what else?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.630
Oh, please. Do not test the Lord.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.673
[Dana Sue] Well, I better call Erik

08:27.757 --> 08:29.884
and get the perishables
back to Sullivan's.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.763
[chainsaw whirring]

08:34.263 --> 08:36.057
If we don't get power back at this spa,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.226
we're gonna have to rethink
this whole menu.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.020
All right, what do you think?
Crudités by candlelight?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.856
Mm, we can be a little more creative
than that.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.442
-Okay.
-I'm thinking dessert-heavy.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.277
And a prayer that the city comes through.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.571
-Genius.
-[laughs] Isaac,

08:51.155 --> 08:52.907
pull that box of ramekins
out of storage, will you?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.158
You got it.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.746
I'm scared to ask what else can go wrong.
Thank God Ryan showed up when he did.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.500
Who is this Ryan guy anyway? 
Overheard y'all mention him once or twice.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.211
Oh, he's Helen's first and greatest love.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.506
Ms. Frances is his aunt. 
He used to spend his summers with her.

09:08.589 --> 09:12.552
Helen would conveniently
not be in a relationship every June,

09:12.635 --> 09:15.888
and after high school, they chased 
each other across the country for a while,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.057
but fate had other plans.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.935
So, you know, some might say

09:21.018 --> 09:22.770
that he's the one that got away.

09:22.853 --> 09:26.399
-Looks like he didn't get away completely.
-How long were he and Ms. Helen together?

09:26.482 --> 09:30.403
All right, you know what?
Does my shirt say Helen's Diary?

09:31.153 --> 09:33.364
[Dana Sue]
Listen, history lesson can wait.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.616
It always repeats itself anyway.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.085
Looks like everything is up to code.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.130
Cute little venture
you have on your hands here.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.881
So you'll sign it off?

09:50.965 --> 09:53.175
Just as soon as you clear
the rest of this equipment

09:53.259 --> 09:54.677
and the rest of that tree.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.429
-It's a fire hazard.
-Okay.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.848
-On it. [grunts]
-[all exclaim]

09:58.931 --> 10:00.891
-Skeeter!
-[Maddie] Are you okay?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.686
[grunts] Oh. I'm all right.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.605
[grunts] I'll just walk it off.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.731
[Helen] Come.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.610
-That's a problem.
-Well, it's just a small, little hole.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.612
With a whole lot of exposed wire.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.948
[stammers] We'll fix it.
Skeeter, this can't take long. Can it?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.993
Well,
I-- I'm not sure we have another sconce.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.412
These were special order.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.957
But-- But we can patch this.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.209
I mean, if this was drywall,
I'd do it myself.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.252
But...

10:30.004 --> 10:34.008
[sighs] But it's plaster.
So I'll call my guy.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.676
If he's not out on the lake,

10:36.135 --> 10:37.845
-maybe a few hours' work.
-[Maddie] Okay.

10:37.928 --> 10:41.599
Petey, if you come back end of day,
we will be right as rain.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.143
No can do. Full schedule today.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.438
We would consider it a personal favor.

10:47.521 --> 10:51.108
One that we would happily return
with a full membership for your wife.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.196
You're not bribing a city official,
now, are you, Mrs. Townsend?

10:56.405 --> 10:57.281
Uh...

10:57.365 --> 10:58.240
Mr. Martin,

11:00.618 --> 11:03.204
allow me to draw your attention

11:03.287 --> 11:06.165
to that sick tree
which made the mess out front,

11:06.248 --> 11:08.250
which the city repeatedly ignored.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.212
Shall we discuss
where the liability attaches

11:11.295 --> 11:13.506
if anybody should get hurt
while clearing it?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.175
-I'm listening.
-Yes.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.261
Allow me to propose a quid pro quo.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.472
You return at the end of the business day

11:21.555 --> 11:22.515
and we...

11:23.849 --> 11:26.394
won't pursue the city for negligence.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.731
I'll be back at 4:45.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.982
Day ends at five.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.943
And I don't work weekends.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.541
Bill and Howie donated a wellness visit
for the fundraiser,

11:48.624 --> 11:51.127
but I just wanted to make sure
the winner had something to carry home.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.505
There's vitamins, a first aid kit,
that sort of thing.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.006
Oh, how thoughtful!

11:56.507 --> 11:58.342
Presentation is everything.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.262
Looking forward to seeing you
Saturday night.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.055
Thank you, but I won't be coming.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.056
Oh...

12:04.557 --> 12:09.019
[sighs] Of course. Bill will come to us,
and you'll go to that spa opening.

12:09.603 --> 12:13.149
I actually wasn't. I don't think
I'd be very welcome there.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.151
[scoffs] Nonsense!

12:15.735 --> 12:17.528
Pregnant and on your feet all day?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.697
You deserve a little pampering.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.617
You won't have time for that sort of thing
once the baby arrives, that's for sure.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.079
Put yourself first while you can, okay?

12:28.622 --> 12:29.874
Go on and get a foot rub.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.917
[laughs]

12:37.882 --> 12:39.008
Oh, hi, darling!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
-Mama.
-I thought I'd check the light

12:41.260 --> 12:43.262
one more time in the yoga studio,

12:43.345 --> 12:46.265
just to make sure 
that it really is the best place

12:46.348 --> 12:47.600
for my latest creation.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.727
Yeah, it's the only place
for your painting,

12:49.810 --> 12:53.647
especially considering I'm not quite sure
what statement you're planning on making.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.941
Oh, ye daughter of little faith!

12:56.025 --> 12:58.194
It's perfection! You'll see!

12:58.277 --> 12:59.653
[chuckles] All right.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.613
[Cal] Hello, ladies.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.114
Oh.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.242
Well! You're a sight for sore eyes.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.037
Mary Vaughn let you out
of volunteer prison?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.706
Oh, the queen bee
has plenty of worker drones.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.500
I thought I might be of more use here.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.461
Yeah, actually could you help Ryan
with that tree out there?

13:15.544 --> 13:17.922
Oh, but don't strain yourself, darlin'.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.300
You need to be in tip-top shape
for the auction tomorrow.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.427
I intend to bring my checkbook

13:23.511 --> 13:26.514
so that I can bid on a date
with Coach Cal.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.142
No, I was very clear with Mary Vaughn.
It is a lunch. Not a date.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.019
[chuckles]

13:32.102 --> 13:34.605
-Of course it is, darlin'.
-[Maddie] Oh, boy.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.942
-It's just a lunch!
-Uh-huh.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.821
[Cal] It's just a lunch.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.662
[Helen] Hey.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.832
Thank you both for, uh, helping out.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.543
-We couldn't have managed without you.
-[Ryan] Happy to help.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.628
Yes, thank you guys so much.

13:57.711 --> 14:00.798
Now I can make it to my baseball mom shift
at Mary Vaughn's.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.884
Oh, you are so welcome, and I am so sorry.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.135
[Maddie chuckles]

14:06.011 --> 14:08.013
I was looking forward
to going to the opening...

14:09.098 --> 14:10.099
with you.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.396
Well, I was looking forward to seeing you
all dressed up for the fundraiser.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.527
Maybe it's better
that we aren't both at the same function.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.529
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Less distractions.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.407
The problem is
you are very much a distraction.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.617
Whether you're with me or not.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.704
Excuse me, Maddie. What time is it?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.956
Uh... it's five o'clock.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.249
Five o'clock?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.584
Petey's nowhere to be found.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.669
-Wait, Petey Martin?
-Yeah.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.213
He's in Mary Vaughn's.
I passed him on the way out.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.258
Excuse me while I go quid
his lazy pro quo.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.515
Jackson, darlin', drape the streamers.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.434
We are not out here hanging laundry!

14:54.476 --> 14:56.353
Mary Vaughn. Peggy.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.982
Petey. We expected you 30 minutes ago.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.150
I got caught up.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.777
And I warned you I had a hard out at five.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.487
Well, I got a hard out for you.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.407
After you didn't hold up
your end of our agreement,

15:08.490 --> 15:10.242
I had no option but to call your boss,

15:10.326 --> 15:13.203
who just happens to be
a former client of mine.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.414
A former and grateful client.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.875
And she would like to have a word.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.336
This is Petey.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.547
Mary Vaughn...

15:23.631 --> 15:25.382
-my apologies for the interruption.
-Yes, ma'am.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.386
Peggy, I will bring my donation
to the newspaper tomorrow morning.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.846
[Peggy] Thank you so much, Helen.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
I didn't know you were a baseball fan.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.186
I'm a fan of whatever matters
to the children of Serenity.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.438
[Petey] Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.

15:41.023 --> 15:41.941
[Helen] Come on, Petey.

15:42.024 --> 15:42.858
All right.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.788
Ugh.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.957
How dare it still be wet?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.750
-We can't paint it like this!
-I know.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.295
It's bad enough that there's no sconce, 
[stammers] but this is just plain ugly.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.840
All right, listen.
We will not stumble at the finish line.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.385
Okay? We just have to cover it.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.679
-Somehow.
-With what?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.763
[Dana Sue sighs]

16:12.846 --> 16:14.306
We could hang a-- a quilt.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.725
All right.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.896
Thought we were brainstorming,
not every idea's a winner.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.314
-You said a quilt!
-I know!

16:22.398 --> 16:23.607
[Paula] Yoo-hoo!

16:23.691 --> 16:25.317
-Girls!
-Oh, dear.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.987
The artiste is here.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.446
-[Helen] Ms. Paula!
-Oh, hi!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.448
So who's gonna be a dear

16:31.532 --> 16:34.284
and help me carry this to its hiding spot?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.162
Oh, I mean, its place d'honneur.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.665
Um, Ms. Paula,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.626
I think we can help each other.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.635
Well, well. Hey there, Maddie.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.179
Party planning
isn't for the faint of heart now, is it?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.557
Well, since I won't be back tonight
to help,

16:56.640 --> 16:59.476
I thought that I would bring by
a few extra auction items.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.437
Including some spa memberships.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.064
I suppose we call y'all
the Sweet Magnolias for a reason.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.065
[chuckles]

17:05.149 --> 17:08.068
And I brought you
one of Dana Sue's homemade scrubs

17:08.152 --> 17:09.028
as a gift.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.865
There might've been a time in our lives

17:12.948 --> 17:15.367
where we would have looked
at something like tonight

17:15.451 --> 17:16.410
as a competition.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.538
Just... isn't it nice
that we're past that now?

17:21.457 --> 17:24.626
I really hope that your event
is everything that you need it to be.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.629
-[chuckles]
-Have fun.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.432
-[Dana Sue] As far as I can tell.
-[Helen] All right.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.142
Mama. Hello.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.103
Um... your painting's supposed to go
in the yoga studio.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.815
Oh, uh, we had to do something.
The plaster's still wet.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.026
So are you ready to see it?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.319
I don't know. Am I?

17:56.742 --> 17:57.826
[all gasp]

17:59.036 --> 18:00.204
[Helen] Oh, Ms. Paula.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.290
-It's--
-Perfection.

18:04.124 --> 18:04.958
Mama.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.670
For my Sweet Magnolias.

It's finally happening.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.623

And this is only just the beginning.

Oh, it's early yet.

will be able to slip away.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.447
Where are you, kiddo?

20:40.530 --> 20:41.490
[Annie] Still here.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.743
I'm supposed to be shooting photos
for the baseball fundraiser,

20:44.826 --> 20:46.703
and I thought
Mom would let me leave by now,

20:46.787 --> 20:48.747
but she's way too wrapped up to notice.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.249
It's a pretty big night for her.

to take pictures for the newspaper,
and Ty is...

20:58.257 --> 21:00.217
And time is slipping away.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.635
I get it.

have everything under control.

-Really?
-Really.

Go talk to your mom.

If she says it's okay, then off you go.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.065
Thank you. Thank... Thank you.

21:15.649 --> 21:20.362
So all of our scrubs are handmade
and hypoallergenic, so you're--

21:20.445 --> 21:21.488
Mom?

21:21.571 --> 21:25.492
Uh, and all of our products are organic
and locally sourced.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.952
[Annie] Excuse me, Mom?

21:27.035 --> 21:30.122
[Dana Sue] There's nothing in this that
you have not been around your whole life.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.582
-[Helen] Besides her expertise, of course.
-Excuse me, Chef?

21:34.418 --> 21:36.712
You know what, pardon me. Just one moment.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.299
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

21:40.382 --> 21:42.843
Have you left your manners at home,
young lady?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.303
It's almost nine o'clock.

Me taking pictures of the baseball thing.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.268
-For the school paper.
-Right. Yes.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.395
I gave Simon my word.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.397
I can't let him or the newspaper down.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.693
Okay, listen, I was hoping that you and I
would have some time together tonight.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.073
Okay, I understand. Go.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.158
Thanks, Mom.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.327
[woman] This is the place!

22:08.702 --> 22:10.620
Oh, there's the champagne!

22:13.332 --> 22:15.709
Hello! Ooh. Come on.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.502
-Hi, welcome!
-Hi. How are you?

22:17.586 --> 22:18.754
-[Dana Sue] Hello!
-Welcome.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.048
Hi!

22:21.131 --> 22:22.841
Hey! Hi!

22:22.924 --> 22:24.509
Hi, hi!

22:24.593 --> 22:25.761
[chuckles]

22:25.844 --> 22:26.928
Mama?

22:27.012 --> 22:31.433
I might've mentioned your venture
to a few friends of mine in Charleston

22:31.516 --> 22:34.227
and perhaps they mentioned it
to a friend or two.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.521
It's called advertising.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.857
-Thank you.
-And they are fabulous.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.817
And they are all yours.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.403
I have got to dash off
to this baseball thingie.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.654
Spend some money.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.156
-Ms. Paula?
-Yeah?

22:46.239 --> 22:48.116
-Can I catch a ride?
-Of course, sweetheart.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.912
Hey! Text me when you get there
and back by 11:30 to help clean up.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.330
Yeah.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.999
Thank you.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.093
That was great fun.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.219
Oh, I'm just gonna say hi.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.804
Hey, how are you?

23:09.846 --> 23:12.182
[indistinct chatter]

23:13.183 --> 23:14.059
[laughing]

23:15.852 --> 23:16.853
[camera shutter clicks]

23:17.562 --> 23:18.480
[mic feedback]

23:18.563 --> 23:20.107
I'd like to thank y'all
for coming out tonight

23:20.190 --> 23:21.983
and supporting these fine boys.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.819
[cheering]

23:23.902 --> 23:25.654
And a special thank you to Coach Maddox

23:25.737 --> 23:28.448
for taking such great care
of our boy Jackson.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.661
And also best wishes
to Assistant Coach Harlan Bixby

23:32.744 --> 23:34.162
who couldn't be here with us tonight

23:34.246 --> 23:36.998
because that darling wife of his
is in labor!

23:37.082 --> 23:39.209
[cheering]

23:39.292 --> 23:41.545
All right now, let's get down to business.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.338
But I am just the mayor.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.133
The real boss,
as I'm sure y'all are quite aware of,

23:46.216 --> 23:47.843
is standing beside me right here

23:47.926 --> 23:50.095
and I'm gonna let her take things
from here.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.013
[cheering]

23:52.097 --> 23:53.056
Thank you, honey.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.767
Good evening, Serenity!

23:56.643 --> 24:00.188
Well, I don't know about you, 
but I am so thankful the weather held.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.608
You know what they say,
God smiles on the worthy.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.901
[laughter]

24:04.985 --> 24:07.154
So drink up, and let's start our auction.

24:07.821 --> 24:11.074
Our first item is a marvelous offer:

24:11.741 --> 24:14.494
a wellness visit
with one of Serenity's finest,

24:14.578 --> 24:16.538
Dr. Bill Townsend.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.748
Who would like to start the bidding?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.168
Now, I don't need to remind you

24:21.251 --> 24:25.881
that Dr. Bill held an illustrious record
for the 1998 team

24:26.548 --> 24:29.634
with the third most RBIs that season.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.311
Thirty dollars.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.437
[Mary] Sold!

24:40.520 --> 24:42.898
Thirty dollars to Peggy Martin.
Thank you, Peggy.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.068
Our next item on the auction block:

24:47.152 --> 24:49.529
a date with Coach Cal Maddox.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.655
[cheering]

24:54.075 --> 24:56.620
Well, my, my,
aren't we living in high cotton.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.872
-Let's start the bidding at 50 dollars.
-Fifty dollars!

24:58.955 --> 25:02.000
-Thank you, 50. Who will bid 75?
-[woman] Seventy-five!

25:02.083 --> 25:03.168
Thank you, 75!

25:03.251 --> 25:05.253
-May I join you?
-[Mary] How about 100?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.047
-[woman 2] One hundred!
-Sure.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.299
-[Mary] Let's hear it for 150.
-Happy to have the company.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.092
-[Mary] Thank you 150.
-Oh, you can't be that desperate.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.722
The most embarrassing thing to teenagers
is being seen with their parents, so...

25:15.805 --> 25:17.307
[Mary] How about 250?

25:17.390 --> 25:19.809
-[woman 3] Three hundred dollars!
-Oh, $300.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.896
My, my, what splendid generosity!

25:22.979 --> 25:24.439
Excuse me.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.857
Do I have 350?

25:25.941 --> 25:27.776
Five hundred dollars!

25:27.859 --> 25:30.445
[cheering]

25:30.529 --> 25:31.780
[Mary] Five hundred dollars.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.990
Well, well, thank you, Ms. Paula!

25:34.574 --> 25:36.368
-[Mary] Will anyone--
-I doubt it.

25:37.285 --> 25:40.789
Yes, ma'am. Going once, going twice,

25:40.872 --> 25:43.667
sold for $500 to Ms. Paula!

25:44.501 --> 25:47.629
[Mary] Our next item
is a Grand Slam Pizza Party,

25:47.712 --> 25:51.258
donated by Grace and Neville Wharton.
How much do you love them?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.094
The wellness visit,
it's good for the whole practice?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.681
Sure, I'll tell Howie.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.017
Nice touch with the cute basket this year.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.895
Yeah, that there was all Noreen.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.814
Oh, I don't doubt that for a minute.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.857
[Mary] Thank you, 50! How about 75?

26:07.941 --> 26:09.526
Thank you, 75. Who will bid one...

26:18.660 --> 26:19.911
[sighs]

26:25.041 --> 26:27.168
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.087
I just needed a moment to...

26:29.170 --> 26:30.797
Mm. Me too.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.600
[stammers] I gotta say, I'm...

26:43.810 --> 26:45.395
I'm surprised to see you here.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.523
Why? It's the hottest ticket in town.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.234
Let those boys have their baseball,
right? And us girls...

26:55.697 --> 26:57.616
You chose the most glorious paint colors.

26:57.699 --> 27:01.161
This room is peaceful,
but it's not too sleepy, you know.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.121
It was our yoga studio.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.499
Really? Oh, are y'all gonna have
some prenatal classes?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.335
'Cause I hear it's so good and I just...

27:11.796 --> 27:12.964
[sighs]

27:16.051 --> 27:17.719
I want what's best for the baby.

27:21.681 --> 27:22.515
Like...

27:23.725 --> 27:24.809
any mother would.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.104
Look...

27:31.650 --> 27:33.568
we don't have to be enemies, Noreen...

27:35.320 --> 27:36.905
but we're not gonna be friends.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.455
Hey.

27:46.998 --> 27:52.295
Noreen was just complimenting us 
on our calming choice of colors in here.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.505
[Noreen] It-- It's beautiful.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.674
The whole spa is.

27:56.925 --> 27:57.926
Um, I...

27:58.635 --> 28:02.305
I think all the ladies of Serenity
should come enjoy it.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.308
We hope all the ladies of Serenity
do come enjoy it.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.815
Well, I'm just gonna mill about a bit.

28:15.902 --> 28:16.986
Hey, Noreen.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.364
Make sure you pick up
one of Dana Sue's scrubs.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.033
It'll feel great on your feet
when they puff up.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.161
Mighty gracious. Thank you.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.209
Bless her heart.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.378
What'd she say?

28:34.838 --> 28:36.131
All the wrong things.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.052
But, honestly, what could she say?

28:43.304 --> 28:44.347
[sighs]

28:47.809 --> 28:48.977
[Mary] Hey, y'all.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.898
I am moderately pleased to announce

28:53.982 --> 28:59.362
that we have raised
just a bit over $3,000 tonight!

28:59.821 --> 29:01.364
[cheering]

29:01.448 --> 29:04.117
But we are still shy of our goal

29:04.200 --> 29:07.412
of what we need
to send our fine boys to regionals.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.374
Perhaps our biggest money-earner
of the night, Coach Cal,

29:11.458 --> 29:14.961
might have some idea of how we might
be able to make up the difference.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.296
Perhaps another date?

29:16.379 --> 29:17.422
[cheering]

29:17.505 --> 29:18.590
[Cal clears throat]

29:18.673 --> 29:23.178
Seeing as how I have stepped way out
of my comfort zone this evening,

29:23.887 --> 29:27.557
I think it's about time these boys
stretch a few new muscles of their own.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.892
So how about a car wash?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.518
[boys booing]

29:31.060 --> 29:31.936
[boy] Come on, Coach!

29:32.020 --> 29:35.940
Coach Maddox, don't you think
with all the studies and practice,

29:36.024 --> 29:38.026
these boys deserve
a little bit of a break?

29:38.651 --> 29:40.445
-Huh, guys?
-There you go.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.696
How about a bake sale?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.947
[boys booing]

29:43.031 --> 29:44.157
[Bill] Here.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.450
[boy 2] I don't bake, Coach!

29:45.533 --> 29:49.496
That should be enough to cover the bus
and accommodations to regionals.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.789
[applause]

29:50.872 --> 29:55.168
Well, with this very generous donation
from Dr. Bill Townsend,

29:55.251 --> 29:57.504
-we have met our goal!
-[cheering]

29:57.587 --> 29:58.713
And then some!

29:58.797 --> 30:03.301
Dr. T! Dr. T! Dr. T!

30:03.718 --> 30:10.141
Dr. T! Dr. T! Dr. T! Dr. T! Dr. T!

30:22.153 --> 30:23.279
Good technique.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.572
It's really kinda fun.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.866
Yeah, it's all about finding the zone.

30:26.950 --> 30:27.867
[chuckles]

30:27.951 --> 30:29.702
Now, pastries might not seem cool,

30:29.786 --> 30:32.539
but they can be the fastest way
into the heart of a woman.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.669
Something on your mind, Kyle?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.546
[stammers] No. No. I just...

30:42.006 --> 30:43.550
H-- How do you make someone like you?

30:44.050 --> 30:45.677
No, man. That's how stalkers think.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.555
-You can't make someone like you.
-Well, that sucks.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.640
All right, you wanna win in love?

30:51.808 --> 30:53.268
Live your best life.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.186
It'll happen when it's meant to.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.229
You're a great kid.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.065
-You're great, and you're not married.
-Well, I was.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.193
Man, you're divorced too?

31:03.319 --> 31:05.280
Everyone I know is divorced.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.365
I mean,
what's the point of even liking someone?

31:08.741 --> 31:11.035
Let's, uh, get this cake finished.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.414
I know one lady who's gonna be thrilled
to have it tonight.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.838
I remember Ms. Frances
couldn't keep you to a playpen

31:21.921 --> 31:24.257
-with duct tape if she wanted to.
-[laughter]

31:24.340 --> 31:27.510
Man, that's nothing compared
to the ruckus you caused with Helen

31:27.594 --> 31:29.596
once your whiskers poked out!

31:29.679 --> 31:31.931
[stammers] Y'all wanna make me blush?

31:32.015 --> 31:34.267
Well, we knew
you were gonna travel the whole world.

31:34.350 --> 31:35.852
But where's your next stop?

31:35.935 --> 31:39.105
South Africa
for a regenerative farming conference.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.734
The project we're looking into aims
to restore the natural biodiversity

31:42.817 --> 31:45.528
to a couple of hot spots
in Zambia and Madagascar.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.406
-That certainly sounds important.
-It is.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.699
You gonna be gone long?

31:50.199 --> 31:51.701
Uh, after the conference?

31:52.785 --> 31:54.495
I don't know. I gotta reevaluate.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.373
Might not need to be boots on the ground
for every project.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.501
Well, I'll tell you what, we sure do hope
that you be back real soon.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.003
-That's right.
-Yes, sir.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.923
That's the funny thing about Serenity,
I never realize...

32:05.340 --> 32:08.509
how much I miss it
till I'm back feeling so at home again...

32:08.593 --> 32:09.719
[man] Mm-hmm.

32:09.802 --> 32:10.887
Speaking of.

32:10.970 --> 32:11.888
Mm.

32:11.971 --> 32:15.808
Uh, I'm really happy that you menfolk
have had a chance to catch up.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.353
But there are empty glasses

32:18.436 --> 32:19.812
-in every corner.
-[grunts]

32:20.855 --> 32:21.731
Every corner.

32:21.814 --> 32:24.692
-We're getting back to work right now.
-Go on!

32:24.776 --> 32:26.486
-Right now.
-You're cute!

32:28.363 --> 32:29.906
[laughing]

32:29.989 --> 32:33.284
-[Ryan] You look so beautiful.
-[Helen] Thank you!

32:35.620 --> 32:37.497
[Mary] Now I want to introduce you
to my niece.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.291
She just graduated from college. And...

32:40.375 --> 32:42.043
-Mary Vaughn!
-Ms. Paula!

32:42.126 --> 32:45.046
Ah. Thank you for a lovely evening.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.632
But it's time to kick it up a notch.

32:47.715 --> 32:50.385
-Or three.
-Ms. Paula, are you headed to the spa?

32:50.468 --> 32:51.844
-You need a ride?
-I do.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.304
-Well, come on then.
-Okay.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.099
-And this is good night.
-Good night!

32:56.474 --> 32:59.936
But don't think for a minute
that this replaces our date together.

33:00.019 --> 33:03.189
No, ma'am. I'm hiring a car
for our... lunch.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.315
[Bill] Coach Maddox!

33:04.941 --> 33:07.110
-Leaving so soon?
-[Cal] Yeah.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.363
I have a, uh... another commitment.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.324
Thank you

33:13.825 --> 33:15.576
for everything you did
for the team tonight.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.913
It's greatly appreciated.
