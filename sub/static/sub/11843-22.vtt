00:03.169 --> 00:04.659
The way I'm drawn to her--

00:04.738 --> 00:06.797
It's not just attraction.
It's something else.

00:11.778 --> 00:15.043
- Oh, my God.
- It's not just what I want.

It made you think something was happening
right in front of you when it really wasn't.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.605
I'm going to go into Pierce's head-
distract him-

If we make it there,
it'll buy us some time.

01:23.548 --> 01:25.482

- All right? We heard gunshots.
- <i>Michael</i> Aster? to me.

06:07.465 --> 06:09.763
We have to turn around.
We have to go to the pod chamber.

me if anything ever happened to him...

- to go to the pod chamber. - What are we
supposed to do, just go there and wait?

06:17.475 --> 06:21.207

- He's safe. That's all I can tell you right now.
- Well, that's not good enough.

18:14.225 --> 18:16.216
It'll have to be. Turn around.

18:16.294 --> 18:19.457
- What? No.
- I said turn around!

18:21.265 --> 18:24.064
Look, if anything happens
to my father because of you...

18:24.135 --> 18:26.229
I swear to God, I will kill you myself.

18:26.304 --> 18:29.740
I can't explain anything right now.

18:29.807 --> 18:32.970
This wasn't supposed to happen.
[ Panting]

18:33.044 --> 18:36.173
Your father's okay.just stay put.

18:36.247 --> 18:39.410
He doesn't want you involved.

18:39.483 --> 18:42.282
Don't let him out of there,
and we'll all be okay.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.468
If you're here to kill me,
Sheriff, it won't do any good.

19:07.545 --> 19:10.947
There'll be a new man
in charge of the unit in 24 hours.

19:11.015 --> 19:13.712
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

19:13.784 --> 19:16.446
<i>Then why are you here?</i>

19:16.520 --> 19:19.751
'Cause I'm scared-

19:19.824 --> 19:24.091
<i>for myself, for my son, for all of us.</i>

19:26.831 --> 19:30.961
<i>You didn't seem scared last night when
you put a bullet six inches from my heart.</i>

19:31.035 --> 19:34.835
There were things I didn't know
last night, things that change everything.

19:34.905 --> 19:37.636
I don't think anything's changed.
I think they sent you here.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.439
Damn it.
This is bigger than you can imagine.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.775
<i>I heard them. I know their plan.</i>

19:42.847 --> 19:46.977
Right now, they're disabling
your agents, one by one.

19:47.051 --> 19:49.247

- You don't believe me.

19:50.254 --> 19:52.951
Get 'em on the radio. Go on.

19:53.024 --> 19:56.119
Agent Bello.
Agent Bello, come in.

19:56.193 --> 19:58.491
<i>Bello.</i>

19:58.562 --> 20:01.463
Samuels, do you read me?
This is Pierce.

20:11.742 --> 20:14.643
I want those aliens.

20:17.548 --> 20:22.008
First, we deal.
My name stays clean.

20:22.086 --> 20:24.612
I get a government pension
for me and my father...

20:24.689 --> 20:27.852
for the rest of our lives
and nobody bothers us- nobody.

20:27.925 --> 20:33.295
<i>And my son, he stays protected.</i>

20:33.364 --> 20:35.526
I'll get the three of you new identities.

20:38.536 --> 20:44.031
But you- you will show me
where they are.

21:11.068 --> 21:14.527
Soon as we see them all,
shoot to kill, Sheriff.

21:14.605 --> 21:16.699
What about the civilians?

21:16.773 --> 21:20.641
There's always a price
to pay... for freedom.

21:22.713 --> 21:25.614

- <i>[Struggling]</i>

you were out to get us.

22:13.330 --> 22:16.129
And I'm glad I was wrong.

22:21.004 --> 22:24.133
I'll take care of Pierce
as soon as Max gets what he needs.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.370
What are you going to do?

22:26.443 --> 22:29.970
This guy I know at
the attorney generaFs office-

22:30.047 --> 22:32.277
I already put in the call.

22:32.349 --> 22:35.114
You think the government's gonna do
something about Pierce? He's part of it.

22:35.185 --> 22:37.654
He's not the good part of it.

22:37.721 --> 22:41.123
See, we don't tolerate secret
government action in this country.

22:41.191 --> 22:43.626
At least, not once
the press gets ahold of it.

22:43.694 --> 22:45.628
I hope you're right.

22:45.696 --> 22:47.858
It's time for this to be over.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.259
[ Max]
Good evening, Agent Pierce.

22:53.737 --> 22:57.298
- You know who I am.
- [ Projector Clicking]

22:57.374 --> 22:59.433
I know who you are.

23:01.178 --> 23:03.613
And now you're going to tell me...

23:03.680 --> 23:06.843
everything.

23:08.385 --> 23:10.945
I've got nothing to say.

23:11.989 --> 23:14.617
We can do this the easy way...

23:14.691 --> 23:16.955
or the hard way.

23:18.428 --> 23:20.658
It's up to you.

23:22.332 --> 23:24.460
What happened to Nasedo?

23:26.370 --> 23:28.998
Did you capture him?

23:31.208 --> 23:34.473
<i>Did you kill him? Tell me!</i>

23:38.148 --> 23:40.139
Max is pounding him with questions.

23:40.217 --> 23:42.151
He's never going to answer them.

23:42.219 --> 23:44.153
That's why we have Isabel.

23:44.221 --> 23:47.521
I've never dream-walked anyone
who wasn't asleep before.

23:47.591 --> 23:50.060
<i>But you did it to Max
when he was captured.</i>

23:50.127 --> 23:52.687
He was drugged. He didn't fight it.
Pierce isn't going to do that.

23:52.763 --> 23:57.360
<i>H' you canjust get in, just even
a little, you?! see his answers.</i>

24:05.475 --> 24:08.001
What happened to Nasedo?

24:08.078 --> 24:10.376
Where is he?

24:12.282 --> 24:15.115
You know what I can do to you.

24:15.185 --> 24:19.349
Tell me what I'm asking,
or I will take you apart...

24:19.423 --> 24:22.290
<i>Piece b y piece...</i>

24:22.359 --> 24:24.453
and make sure you stay conscious enough...

24:24.528 --> 24:27.293
to feel every second of it.

24:28.765 --> 24:33.566
Untie me, and <i>I'll</i> take you to him.

24:33.637 --> 24:36.629
So you do know where he is.

24:55.792 --> 24:59.592
There's a helo meeting us at
jeffords Airstrip out by Hobson.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.792
Hold the body there
until I bring the others.

25:15.245 --> 25:18.476
- What did you see?
- I'm sorry.

25:21.518 --> 25:24.180
It looks like he's dead.

25:28.392 --> 25:30.793
He's not dead. He can't die.

25:30.861 --> 25:32.795
Tess, what do you mean he can't die?

25:32.863 --> 25:35.924
He said that if this ever happened,
that we had the power to bring him back.

25:35.999 --> 25:40.960
- How?
- He told me to find this Indian called River Dog.

25:41.037 --> 25:43.938
<i>He has these stones.</i>

25:44.007 --> 25:46.032
- The healing stones.
- You know about them?

25:46.109 --> 25:48.168
<i>Yeah, we already have them.</i>

25:48.245 --> 25:51.442
<i>Then all we need is Nasedo.
You did see where they took him.</i>

25:55.419 --> 25:57.353
Yes.

26:04.628 --> 26:08.292
So, this guy at the attorney general's-

26:09.399 --> 26:12.334
- Sheriff.
- Hmm?

26:12.402 --> 26:14.427
<i>The one you called?</i>

26:14.504 --> 26:18.498
<i>Is he coming here
or are you taking Pierce to him?</i>

26:18.575 --> 26:21.135
I haven't decided yet.

26:26.082 --> 26:28.380
<i>There is no guy, is there?</i>

26:30.387 --> 26:34.824
lfl turn him in.
I turn all of you in.

26:38.562 --> 26:41.896
He kills people, Michael.
It's what the guy does.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.060
<i>He killed Topolsky and Stevens
and six innocent people in that hospital...</i>

26:48.138 --> 26:51.233
and who knows how many others.

26:51.308 --> 26:54.334

I wanted to kill him. I mean,
that's all that I could think about.

I wanted him dead.
Knowing that, I just did it.

31:11.201 --> 31:13.693
It just happened.

31:13.770 --> 31:16.865
What kind of person does that make me?

- No. The bottom line, Maxwell?

don't know who else you may contact in the process.
