WEBVTT

00:24.983 --> 00:29.236
N- No. 17!

00:29.320 --> 00:31.613
Why, you...

00:34.659 --> 00:37.244
What are you doing?!

00:37.328 --> 00:40.289
I am the one who created you--

00:44.961 --> 00:49.840
You miserable pile of junk!

00:57.057 --> 01:01.977
Doctor Gero was killed by
Artificial Human No. 17,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.313
whom he himself had built.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.773
However...

01:10.070 --> 01:14.239
...the computer that Doctor Gero
had been using continued to operate,

01:14.324 --> 01:21.663
in order to create the
mightiest of all artificial humans.

01:47.649 --> 01:52.903
Break through the shining clouds,
and fly away (fly away)

01:52.987 --> 01:59.993
As a panorama spreads itself
throughout my being!

02:00.078 --> 02:05.332
The earth, having been kicked
in the face, gets angry (angry)!

02:05.416 --> 02:11.880
And makes one of its
volcanoes explode!

02:11.965 --> 02:18.554
If, within the thawed polar ice,

02:18.638 --> 02:27.563
There is a dinosaur, then I want
to train him to balance atop a ball.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.233
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

02:31.317 --> 02:40.242
No matter what may happen,
I feel as though nothing can bother me,

02:40.326 --> 02:43.579
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

02:43.663 --> 02:49.543
However hard your chest pounds,
the Genki Dama will roar!

02:49.627 --> 02:52.880
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

02:52.964 --> 03:01.972
The emptier your head is, the more
room there is to pack with dreams,

03:02.056 --> 03:05.642
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

03:05.727 --> 03:12.566
With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,
today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

03:12.650 --> 03:14.526
Sparking!

04:03.618 --> 04:08.580
"Miss 'World's Most Beautiful Girl'
World Competition"

04:11.334 --> 04:14.127
Hey, Oolong, aren't they
going to start this soon?

04:14.212 --> 04:15.712
You're a fine one to talk.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.798
They said it's going to be
held at 7:00 in the evening.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.135
It was a certain dirty old man that
wanted to line up for it now, I believe.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.471
It's the ones who sit in the very front

04:24.555 --> 04:26.890
that get to see the
pichi-pichi gals the best, you know!

04:26.975 --> 04:27.891
After all,

04:27.976 --> 04:31.478
this is the Miss "World's Most
Beautiful Girl" World Competition!

04:31.562 --> 04:35.190
Just imagining it makes my blood pressure rise!

04:42.573 --> 04:44.241
To be able to get young pichi-pichi gals

04:44.325 --> 04:46.910
to play pafu-pafu with me
after going so long without...

04:46.995 --> 04:49.454
Pichi-pichi gals, huh?

04:59.966 --> 05:05.554
You guys! Both of you, cut it
out with your indecent thoughts!

05:05.638 --> 05:08.890
We're in front of Trunks here, aren't we?

05:08.975 --> 05:12.811
Um, Kuririn-san, I don't particularly...

05:12.895 --> 05:15.480
You guys are going to corrupt
this young man's purity of heart!

05:15.565 --> 05:17.149
Ha! You're a fine one to say so!

05:17.233 --> 05:20.819
Kuririn! What was all that earlier?

05:20.903 --> 05:23.530
There's no use for us to line up here!

05:23.614 --> 05:25.824
Let's go peek into the changing rooms!
Quickly, let's go!

05:25.908 --> 05:29.161
We might be able to peek in at
a girl changing into her swimsuit!

05:29.245 --> 05:34.499
Ah, I wonder, are there going to be
any cute girls that would be my bride?!

05:34.584 --> 05:38.003
O- oh, no, that was a just a gag!

05:38.087 --> 05:40.797
That was obviously just a gag, wasn't it?

05:40.882 --> 05:46.136
I aim to be a martial artist that can
also let fly with the gags, you know!

05:46.220 --> 05:49.473
Well, Oolong, let's go peek into
the dressing rooms, just you and I!

05:49.557 --> 05:52.476
Sure thing! Kuririn, keep our places for us!

05:52.560 --> 05:56.021
Come on, now! I'm going to tell the police!

05:59.650 --> 06:02.903
Trunks... sorry, man!
Hold our places, okay?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.905
Kuririn-san!

06:04.989 --> 06:07.908
What am I going to do with them?

06:07.992 --> 06:11.870
I wish Goku-san and the others
would finish shopping already.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.797
I had that one first!

06:21.881 --> 06:27.135
Gohan, why do women love
shopping as much as this?

06:27.220 --> 06:31.807
In Mother's case, it looks like
she uses shopping to relieve stress.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.475
Maybe that's it...

06:33.559 --> 06:36.103
Goku-sa, take these too!

06:41.567 --> 06:43.819
Are you finished now, ChiChi?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.904
Next up are clothes for you, Goku-sa!

06:45.988 --> 06:48.240
You wear the same thing all year round!

06:48.324 --> 06:50.867
You're goin' to dress up once in a while!

07:15.893 --> 07:18.186
...I'm just a bit run-down, that's all--

08:04.650 --> 08:06.693
Son Goku...

08:06.986 --> 08:10.405
"Good fortune"

08:10.490 --> 08:13.241
Kuririn and the others sure goofed up!

08:13.326 --> 08:16.495
To think they were off by a whole day!

08:16.579 --> 08:19.456
I thought it was kind of strange, you know?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.833
I mean, nobody was lining up, except for us.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.878
Well, we'll just have to
look forward to tomorrow.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.354
Welcome-

09:17.014 --> 09:19.849
--What's wrong?
--What's the matter?

09:36.909 --> 09:43.164
Gohan, you've got to eat more!
You'll never grow up, otherwise!

09:43.249 --> 09:46.793
I just can't keep up with Father's appetite.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.962
You should stop eatin'
before you get stuffed.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.798
If you eat too much, then the blood
stops circulatin' to your head, you know.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.175
And that gets in the way of studyin'.

10:05.229 --> 10:09.149
'Scuse me, can I get another helping?

10:17.575 --> 10:19.826
Son Goku!

10:19.910 --> 10:22.287
Son Goku...

10:38.888 --> 10:40.013
Father!

11:05.331 --> 11:08.083
G- Gohan, don't you let go!

11:23.557 --> 11:27.852
Who is it that did all this?

11:47.915 --> 11:51.167
Gohan, get ChiChi to safety!
Kuririn, Trunks, you too!

11:51.252 --> 11:53.795
Get everyone as far
away from me as you can!

11:53.879 --> 11:56.131
Ah! Those high heels were expensive!

11:56.215 --> 11:57.841
Mother!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.983
Sure enough, it looks
like they're only after me.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.619
Who are you guys?

12:36.547 --> 12:43.344
Seeing as how I can't sense any
ki from you, you ain't human, huh?

12:48.893 --> 12:55.482
I get it. That means that you're artificial
humans, created by Doctor Gero, huh?

12:55.566 --> 12:58.276
He doesn't give up easily, does he?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.431
Goku-san!

14:10.975 --> 14:12.600
Trunks!

14:26.574 --> 14:30.827
Goku-san! If we fight here,
the casualties will just increase!

14:30.911 --> 14:34.497
Let's fly off to the glacial belt to
the north, where no one else is around!

14:34.582 --> 14:35.498
All right!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.208
You guys, come on!

14:57.313 --> 14:59.230
Kuririn-san!

14:59.315 --> 15:01.566
Gohan, unfortunately,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.902
it doesn't look like we have
any part to play this time.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.904
Our levels are too different.

15:05.988 --> 15:10.575
But still, we might be of
some use to them! I'm going!

15:10.659 --> 15:12.285
--Gohan!
--No you don't!

15:15.247 --> 15:18.875
Startin' tomorrow, you've got
summer cram school courses, don't you?!

15:18.959 --> 15:20.835
We've already paid the tuition!

15:20.920 --> 15:21.794
B- but...

15:21.879 --> 15:23.421
Durin' this summer vacation,

15:23.505 --> 15:27.133
you promised me you
would study, didn't you?!

15:27.217 --> 15:29.886
Mother, between studying and Father's life,

15:29.970 --> 15:32.805
which is more important?!

15:32.890 --> 15:34.515
Ah, Gohan!

15:36.894 --> 15:39.103
See here, Gohan!

15:43.233 --> 15:44.567
Gohan!

15:45.569 --> 15:46.819
ChiChi-san...

15:46.904 --> 15:50.490
I know well how Gohan must feel.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.450
Kuririn!

15:54.578 --> 15:58.623
What are you dawdlin' around for?!
You've got to get goin'!

16:01.335 --> 16:02.585
Hurry up and go!

16:02.670 --> 16:03.628
Ee-yow!

16:05.965 --> 16:09.258
Kuririn, be careful, okay?

16:10.970 --> 16:15.390
Damn. Looks like I'll never
find a bride in this lifetime.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.584
Son Goku...

17:10.319 --> 17:13.823
Nobody should have to hold back here!

17:13.906 --> 17:14.824
Now, come on!

17:14.907 --> 17:18.077
I won't let you lay a finger on Goku-san!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.377
Trunks...

17:34.219 --> 17:35.511
Trunks!

18:00.329 --> 18:02.080
G- Goku-san!

18:09.630 --> 18:14.550
Not even Son Goku is able to fight
the way he had hoped, it seems.

18:41.245 --> 18:46.499
That Doctor Gero... Just how
many artificial humans did he make?

18:46.583 --> 18:50.670
We are artificial humans, born of
the computer that Doctor Gero used,

18:50.754 --> 18:54.799
for the sole purpose of killing you.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.552
His computer? To kill me?

18:57.636 --> 19:03.891
Doctor Gero's desire for vengeance upon
you was transferred into the computer.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.352
We are what was created from
the hatred that had increased

19:06.436 --> 19:10.565
inside the computer once it
obtained the desire for vengeance.

19:12.568 --> 19:17.488
Son Goku, all of your data has
been input into the computer,

19:17.573 --> 19:19.824
and we can predict any move you make.

19:19.908 --> 19:24.495
That is why No. 15 was
able to read your every move.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.499
How can a computer make
someone's hatred grow by itself?!

19:28.584 --> 19:33.171
Kid, our only objective is to kill Son Goku.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.299
However, if you get in the way,
then that's another story!

19:36.383 --> 19:41.470
We will kill anyone that defends Son Goku!

19:41.555 --> 19:46.142
We'll see if it goes as easily as that.

19:46.226 --> 19:50.897
Let's see if you can last even a minute
with No. 14 and No. 15 as your opponents.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.483
Kuririn-san...

19:54.568 --> 19:55.943
All right!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.164
K- Kuririn-san?

20:08.248 --> 20:10.041
Awesome...

20:10.125 --> 20:13.753
We'll just have to watch how
things go from here for a little while.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.423
Son Goku, you will fight me now.

20:17.507 --> 20:22.136
All of our circuits were
built in order to defeat you.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.473
You cannot escape from this place alive.

20:25.557 --> 20:30.811
You let innocent people get caught in
the crossfire while trying to kill me?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.189
I definitely ain't letting
you get away with that!

21:00.300 --> 21:00.925
Father!

21:00.968 --> 21:04.679
Wait, Gohan! At our power,
there's nothing we can do!

21:12.562 --> 21:13.854
Goku-san!

21:34.918 --> 21:36.836
Trunks-san!

22:01.653 --> 22:03.321
Just as I should have expected.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.949
To think that you could take that
blast of mine head-on and still be alive!

23:57.978 --> 23:59.562
Father!

23:59.646 --> 24:00.604
Gohan!

24:07.988 --> 24:12.158
Are you saying you plan to catch
the whole of my S.S. Deadly Bomber?!

24:12.242 --> 24:16.787
It has enough power to blow
away half of this planet!

24:37.559 --> 24:38.767
What?!

25:03.335 --> 25:04.585
Vegeta!

25:04.669 --> 25:05.920
Dad!

25:06.004 --> 25:11.800
Do not misunderstand, Kakarrot.
I did not come to save you.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.512
Kakarrot will be disposed
of at the hand of me,

25:14.596 --> 25:17.515
Vegeta-sama, prince of the Saiyans!

25:18.558 --> 25:21.060
Do you think I would allow
wind-up dolls such as yourselves

25:21.144 --> 25:24.146
to rob me of finishing him off?!

25:24.231 --> 25:28.484
Son Goku has yet another
traveling companion into the next world.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.362
No. 15, you take him!

25:53.885 --> 25:55.970
Let's continue, Son Goku...

26:30.255 --> 26:34.800
What's the matter, Son Goku?
I'm just barely getting warmed up!

26:34.884 --> 26:38.095
Or is it that you're
too afraid to come out?

26:47.897 --> 26:50.399
I've heard what you
guys have been saying!

26:50.483 --> 26:53.527
You underestimate our power!

27:34.903 --> 27:37.946
Don't get too carried away,
you piece of crap!

28:17.904 --> 28:19.446
Dammit!

28:27.914 --> 28:28.831
Kuririn-san!

28:28.915 --> 28:32.960
They've done it! All three
Super Saiyans have come together!

29:27.223 --> 29:28.140
Father!

29:28.224 --> 29:29.892
Way to go, Goku!

29:42.238 --> 29:43.822
Father!

29:43.907 --> 29:45.365
Stop, Gohan!

29:48.578 --> 29:50.704
Ah! Gohan, don't!

29:57.587 --> 29:58.712
Gohan!

30:04.886 --> 30:06.470
It's Piccolo-san!

30:06.554 --> 30:08.514
P- Piccolo?

30:21.569 --> 30:23.487
Yo, Son!

30:23.571 --> 30:26.156
It's Piccolo-san all right!

30:26.241 --> 30:27.825
Piccolo!

30:32.580 --> 30:34.498
Piccolo, I owe you one.

30:34.582 --> 30:35.833
It's not over yet.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.168
He's right.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.504
You're Piccolo, right?

30:40.588 --> 30:43.507
If you're going to interfere
in my fight with Son Goku,

30:43.591 --> 30:46.134
then I'll kill you too, while I'm at it.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.637
You expect me to let you
kill me while you're at it?

30:48.721 --> 30:51.598
You're the one who's
going to come rattling apart!

31:53.912 --> 31:57.205
You guys are nothing but
junk mannequins after all!

31:57.999 --> 32:01.835
No. 14 and No. 15
have been done in, huh?

33:03.648 --> 33:04.564
Vegeta!

33:04.649 --> 33:07.901
Kakarrot, Piccolo, you stay out of this!

33:07.986 --> 33:10.070
I'm going to dispose of this!

33:21.249 --> 33:22.541
Dad!

33:34.554 --> 33:36.013
Vegeta!

33:38.891 --> 33:41.226
Why is it always me?

33:44.230 --> 33:45.605
Dammit!

34:30.234 --> 34:31.525
Father!

34:34.906 --> 34:38.324
I will be the one who defeats Kakarrot!

34:40.244 --> 34:42.579
Goku-san!

35:45.560 --> 35:47.185
Father!

35:55.903 --> 35:56.903
Kuririn-san!

35:56.988 --> 35:58.738
You miserable monster!

36:03.327 --> 36:04.703
Take this!

36:12.253 --> 36:20.552
Kuririn-san!

36:36.903 --> 36:41.823
G- give me... your genki...

36:41.908 --> 36:47.913
Share your... genki... with me!

37:38.256 --> 37:39.381
Father!

37:47.890 --> 37:55.814
Share with me...
share with me... your genki!

37:55.898 --> 38:00.068
From the seas... from the mountains...

38:04.657 --> 38:08.410
Kakarrot belongs to me!

38:08.494 --> 38:10.870
Keep your hands off of
him without my say-so!

38:34.895 --> 38:40.525
Share all of your genki... with me!

38:53.914 --> 38:57.208
Have to let Goku-san...
make that Genki Dama...

39:02.673 --> 39:05.175
Come on, artificial human!

39:05.259 --> 39:09.554
I am he who has come from
twenty years into the future, Trunks!

39:12.892 --> 39:18.480
Twenty years from now,
on Earth, you do not exist!

39:18.564 --> 39:23.860
That is because today, here,
you will be defeated by Goku-san!

40:15.246 --> 40:20.125
Son! Show him the power of a Super Saiyan!

40:26.924 --> 40:29.426
G- Goku, it won't work!

40:29.510 --> 40:33.138
You can't create a
Genki Dama as a Super Saiyan!

40:33.222 --> 40:37.142
You can't create a
Genki Dama with a malicious heart!

42:04.980 --> 42:06.689
Son Goku!

42:13.906 --> 42:17.825
Son Goku!!

43:19.471 --> 43:21.097
Father!

43:22.308 --> 43:23.683
Yo!

43:29.982 --> 43:34.110
At the same time Goku
transformed into a Super Saiyan,

43:34.194 --> 43:40.491
he unconsciously drew the energy from
the dissipating Genki Dama into himself.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.576
That has to be it!

43:41.660 --> 43:43.911
I don't even know!

43:43.996 --> 43:47.498
Kuririn-san, you did well!

43:47.583 --> 43:49.834
You did too, Trunks!

43:49.918 --> 43:52.503
This is what happens when you
don't keep active every once in a while!

43:52.588 --> 43:56.215
Oolong! Yow-ow-ow!

43:57.676 --> 44:01.220
Don't overdo it, Kuririn!

44:01.305 --> 44:02.555
Gohan!

44:02.640 --> 44:06.434
Hurry up and get better,
so you can go to summer school!

44:10.314 --> 44:15.568
By the way, are Piccolo-san
and Vegeta-san going to be all right?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.987
It's not like they're
going to die, you know!

44:49.311 --> 44:53.940
What is it that waits for me?
No one can tell!

44:57.569 --> 45:00.405
An endless ploy,
with a thirst for blood,

45:00.489 --> 45:04.033
closes in without mercy!

45:06.578 --> 45:09.914
We rise to face
everything before our eyes,

45:09.998 --> 45:19.006
as it becomes our time!

45:19.091 --> 45:20.925
My fury (it's at its limit!),

45:21.009 --> 45:23.177
and yes, my power (it's at its limit!)

45:23.262 --> 45:25.346
My threshold (it's at its limit!),

45:25.431 --> 45:28.599
and yes, my limits (are at their limits!)
