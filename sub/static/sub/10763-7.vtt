WEBVTT

00:09.075 --> 00:12.012
Mm, that Lemon Sunrise
smells refreshing.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.314
Ugh! It tastes like a cup of cold sick.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.015
It's hell to be pregnant.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.683
I know.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.547
No, you don't.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.052
No, I don' t.

00:19.052 --> 00:23.556
And that's why I got you this present.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.046
"Belle Du Jour Day Spa"?

00:25.558 --> 00:27.560
Yes, it's for this afternoon.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.551
I think you need a little pampering.

00:30.196 --> 00:30.560
Oh, Niles!

00:31.064 --> 00:32.564
I'm so lucky to have a husband

00:32.564 --> 00:34.556
who's so tolerant of my...

00:35.068 --> 00:35.432
Mood swings?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.404
I would have come up with it.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.405
I'm not stupid.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.407
Hello, all. Hello. Hey.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.409
What a glorious morning it is, isn't it?

00:42.409 --> 00:44.104
May I get my usual, please?

00:44.411 --> 00:46.112
Well, well, nice to see

00:46.112 --> 00:48.114
you're approaching your
first day of private practice

00:48.114 --> 00:49.416
with such an upbeat attitude.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.117
Yes, I'm like an eager schoolboy

00:51.117 --> 00:52.419
on his first day of fractions.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.121
So, how was the Vanlandingham's
party last night?

00:55.121 --> 00:57.123
Weren't you lucky to
snare an invitation?

00:57.123 --> 00:58.124
Yes. No.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.426
No.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.758
Well, I'd better get
over to your father' s.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.263
Call me later.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.251
I will.

01:04.763 --> 01:07.767
Thanks again for my day of beauty.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.270
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.135
Did you snap at me ?
I didn't even notice .

01:12.605 --> 01:14.095
That's because you don't listen.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.113
Ah...

01:20.113 --> 01:21.614
the mood swings.

01:21.614 --> 01:22.615
Takes me back.

01:22.615 --> 01:23.616
Thank you.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.618
Well, anyway, in honor
of your first day,

01:25.618 --> 01:27.120
I want to take you out to lunch.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.621
There's a wonderful Indian restaurant

01:28.621 --> 01:30.123
right across the street
from our building.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.624
Could we order in from them?

01:31.624 --> 01:34.127
I'm booked except between the
hours of 1 1 :45 and 1 2:30.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.116
All right.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.298
My, that's an ambitious first day.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.599
Yes, well, I want to pack in all I can.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.302
That's why I took the day
off from my radio snow.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.293
Well, happy sailing
through the choppy waters

01:44.604 --> 01:46.306
of the dysfunctional and the disturbed.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.604
"Optional eyebrow wax"?!

01:49.309 --> 01:50.606
What is that supposed to mean?!

01:51.311 --> 01:51.606
(sobbing)

01:55.615 --> 01:56.604
Same to you, skipper.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.389
Dr. Crane? I'm Peggy.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.891
I hope I'm not late.

02:04.891 --> 02:05.880
Not at all. Won't you come in?

02:06.392 --> 02:07.393
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

02:07.393 --> 02:08.382
Please, be seated.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.295
First of all, welcome.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.334
Whether our journey
together lasts for years

02:14.334 --> 02:16.536
or just one day,

02:16.536 --> 02:19.172
I can't tell you howexcitedl am

02:19.172 --> 02:20.469
to take this first step with you.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.343
You know I'm just the temp?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.332
Ah.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.746
Well, I see my first patient is here.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.248
If you could just see her in.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.249
Thank you.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.739
Righty-o.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.241
Go right in.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.756
Hello, Dr. Crane. I'm Jane Walsh.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.258
Hello, Jane. Please
be seated, won't you?

02:38.258 --> 02:39.759
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.761
First of all, welcome.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.592
Whether our journey

02:43.830 --> 02:47.267
together lasts for years
or just for one day,

02:47.267 --> 02:48.768
I can't tell you how excited I am

02:48.768 --> 02:50.258
to take this first step with you.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.227
Have we met?

02:52.572 --> 02:54.307
Ah, I am in the media.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.298
So my face is recognizable.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.304
But don't let that inhibit you.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.314
Please, what's on your mind?

03:01.314 --> 03:02.615
Okay, um....

03:02.615 --> 03:08.254
sometimes I feel this, this
kind of sadness hanging over me.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.414
I see.

03:09.622 --> 03:13.593
 And is this sadness
triggered by anything.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.229
Wait. Did you ever date a
woman named Stephanie Walsh?

03:16.229 --> 03:17.630
Yes, a few years ago.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.332
She's my sister.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.321
Oh.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.268
Yeah, I met you at a party once.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.237
Oh, well, then I'm
glad we cleared that up.

03:24.237 --> 03:28.875
All right, now, this sadness of yours,

03:28.875 --> 03:30.243
is it a general...

03:30.243 --> 03:31.267
(snickering)

03:33.580 --> 03:34.581
I'm sorry.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.983
I was just remembering something.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.219
 Uh, yeah, I'm sad all the time

03:39.219 --> 03:41.354
Ah. Yes, well,

03:41.354 --> 03:43.356
you are now in a place

03:43.356 --> 03:44.657
where you can feel free
to express yourself.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.359
(snickers)

03:46.359 --> 03:48.261
I'm sorry. I was just...

03:48.261 --> 03:51.287
I was thinking about something
my sister told me about you.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.334
Well, perhaps we should discuss it.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.735
Okay.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.738
Um, you were in bed with my sister,

03:58.738 --> 04:01.741
and, uh, right in the middle of things,

04:01.741 --> 04:03.732
I guess you called her "Milady. "

04:04.244 --> 04:05.336
(laughs)

04:08.982 --> 04:10.516
I see.

04:10.516 --> 04:11.484
I'm sorry. No, no, please.

04:11.484 --> 04:12.986
It's important that you feel free

04:12.986 --> 04:14.387
to express yourself to me.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.888
Please, go on. All right.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.685
It became this running joke
between me and my sister.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.295
She called me "Milady, "
and I called her "Milady, "

04:22.295 --> 04:24.530
and my mother started doing it,

04:24.530 --> 04:28.591
and now my aunt has
a cat named "Milady. "

04:30.603 --> 04:32.305
This isn't going to work , is it?

04:32.305 --> 04:33.606
No, I don't think so.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.309
I am so sorry, again.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.298
Oh, please, not at all.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.312
 It's just fine

04:39.312 --> 04:41.614
And best of luck conquering
that constant sadneck

04:41.614 --> 04:42.603
(laughs)

04:46.019 --> 04:48.788
(hushed): If you're done, Dr.
C, your next patient is here.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.050
Already?

04:50.323 --> 04:51.391
Yeah, that's me.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.393
I find it best to be no later

04:53.393 --> 04:54.883
than a half hour early.

04:55.395 --> 04:58.398
Saves a lot of anxiety.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.399
First of all,

04:59.399 --> 05:01.801
welcome.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.737
Whether our journey
together lasts for years

05:04.737 --> 05:06.439
or just one day,

05:06.439 --> 05:08.441
I can't tell you how excited I am

05:08.441 --> 05:10.306
to take this first step with you.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.079
No, this won't work.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.808
Thanks. Bye.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.649
Oh! Hello.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.685
Sir... Sir!

05:18.685 --> 05:20.380
That's all right, Peggy.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.346
Goodness, done with your 1 0:00 already?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.648
That was my 1 1 :00.

05:28.394 --> 05:28.883
(phone rings)

05:30.663 --> 05:32.465
Hello.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.467
Calm down! Calm down!

05:34.467 --> 05:34.990
What is it?

05:37.437 --> 05:39.939
I was planning on lunching with Frasier.

05:39.939 --> 05:43.841
No, no, if it's that
urgent , I'll see you then.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.106
Oh, dear.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.913
What's got Daphne all worked up now?

05:46.913 --> 05:48.381
It wasn't Daphne.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.582
It was Maris.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.573
(hisses): Maris?!

05:54.454 --> 05:56.684
I haven't spoken to her for months.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.421
She said she needs to see me.

05:58.725 --> 05:59.792
About what?

05:59.792 --> 06:02.362
I don't know. She was hysterical.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.693
I haven't heard her this panicked

06:04.130 --> 06:05.531
since her strength gave out

06:05.531 --> 06:06.930
halfway through a revolving door.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.628
Uh, I have to cancel lunch.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.641
Can't you see her after lunch?

06:15.641 --> 06:17.143
I have patients. Before, then.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.111
I'm sorry. This just won't work out.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.448
You know, you could at
least give him a chance!

06:22.448 --> 06:24.439
It's his first day!

06:30.556 --> 06:31.557
Excuse me, I'm crazy,

06:31.557 --> 06:33.525
and I need to see the doctor.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.029
Hello, Dad.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.031
I brought you this for your office.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.521
Thank you. Why don't yuo have a seat?

06:42.535 --> 06:44.036
What you doing there?

06:44.036 --> 06:47.039
I'm just trying to figure out this chair

06:47.039 --> 06:48.541
from Stockholm Design.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.577
Instruction booklet alone would account

06:51.577 --> 06:54.444
for the high Swedish suicide rate.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.482
Hey. Hey, Niles.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.017
Niles, listen, how did
things go with Maris?

06:58.017 --> 06:59.485
Maris?!

06:59.485 --> 07:03.489
She invited me to lunch at Le Toque.

07:03.489 --> 07:07.927
She's gotten involved with
some Argentine polo player.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.792
Turns out he's a cad

07:10.463 --> 07:13.433
and a gold digger with
a violent temper to boot.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.424
That's probably what she put in her ad.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.804
So, Niles, what did you tell her?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.744
I told her to leave him.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.447
If he causes trouble,
get a restraining order.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
She was very upset by the whole thing.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
Poor thing completely lost her appetite.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.975
Barely touched her snail.

07:34.987 --> 07:35.988
I'm supposed to be seeing Daphne.

07:35.988 --> 07:36.977
She's going to love this.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.481
Well, you're not going
to tell her, are you?

07:39.992 --> 07:41.627
Well, I think I have to, don't I?

07:41.627 --> 07:44.619
You don't tell your pregnant
wife you had lunch with your ex.

07:44.831 --> 07:45.865
Yes, I agree with Dad.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.834
Normally, I'm a proponent
of telling the truth,

07:47.834 --> 07:50.136
but as a man who's deait
with a pregnant spouse,

07:50.136 --> 07:52.036
I say lie until your pants are on fire.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.543
I see your point, of course,

07:57.543 --> 08:00.012
but this isn't just a
little fib to cover up

08:00.012 --> 08:01.514
some after-work shoe shopping.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.515
This is a big lie.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.005
I'm just not comfortable with it.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.506
Dr. Crane, I'm back from lunch.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.019
Your next patient is here.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.008
Thank you, Peggy.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.524
Well, I'd love to stay
and chat, but duty calls

08:11.524 --> 08:14.516
If you want to wait,
he's usually very quick.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.020
Thank you, Peggy.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.536
Hello, Dr. Crane.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.037
I'm Carol Dryden.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.539
Hi, Carol. Please, come in.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.029
 Uh, won't you sit down?

08:30.042 --> 08:31.532
Welcome.

08:32.044 --> 08:35.535
Whether our journey
lasts for several years

08:36.048 --> 08:37.984
or just for a day,

08:37.984 --> 08:40.019
I want you to know how excited I am

08:40.019 --> 08:41.543
to take this first step with you.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.818
So, what's on your mind?

08:45.224 --> 08:48.261
I guess I have trouble asserting myself.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.751
Uh-huh. How so?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.264
Well, like last week,

08:51.264 --> 08:54.256
I was supposed to have
dinner with some friends...

08:56.000 --> 09:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:06.712 --> 09:08.214
Please, why don't you go ahead?

09:08.214 --> 09:12.718
Anyway, I didn't really
feel up to dinner,

09:12.718 --> 09:16.222
but I'm the kind of
person that hates to dis...

09:16.222 --> 09:17.723
appoint people,

09:17.723 --> 09:20.726
and I was the designated
driver as usual...

09:20.726 --> 09:22.228
Tell you what.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.229
I'm just going to get another chair.

09:23.229 --> 09:27.233
And why don't you keep
talking, if you like.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.735
I can still hear you.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.738
So we go to dinner, and my two friends

09:32.738 --> 09:35.730
on either side of me are talking over me

09:36.242 --> 09:37.743
Iike I'm not even there.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.245
And then when dinner arrived,

09:39.245 --> 09:43.983
my meal didn't come,
and no one even noticed.

09:43.983 --> 09:48.988
I guess after a while, that
kind of thing gets to you.

09:48.988 --> 09:53.925
 It's like people aren't
paying attention to me.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.791
I can see how that would
be very frustrating for you.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.660
And I'm a good person.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.270
But sometimes I just
feel like the whole world

10:04.270 --> 10:05.760
is shutting me out.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.814
Oh, there you are.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.116
I was just calling to see
if you were on your way.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.105
I used to move faster

10:18.818 --> 10:20.115
before I was carrying
your child around in me.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.113
Well, why don't I get you
a soothing cup of herb tea

10:25.825 --> 10:26.814
and then I'll tell you

10:27.126 --> 10:29.829
about a very interesting
lunch I had today.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.820
(phone rings)

10:35.134 --> 10:37.103
Hello.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.105
Yes, he just stepped away.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.106
Who's calling?

10:40.106 --> 10:41.801
What do you want, Maris?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.111
It most certainly is my business.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.812
He's my husband now.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.813
You leave him alone.

10:47.813 --> 10:48.802
That was Maris.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.816
She has some nerve calling

10:50.816 --> 10:52.818
after all she put us through.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.086
How stupid does she think you are

10:54.086 --> 10:55.788
that you'd have anything
more to do with her?

10:55.788 --> 10:58.090
Right.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.792
Cheer me up.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.783
Tell me about your interesting lunch.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.791
Who was it with?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.791
Frasier.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.805
You have lunch with him all the time.

11:12.805 --> 11:13.806
Wait a minute.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.103
I spoke to him earlier.

11:15.741 --> 11:16.730
He told me he was eating in.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.933
And that's the interesting part,

11:19.445 --> 11:21.436
because just then Dad showed up

11:21.947 --> 11:24.950
and that clogged ear
of his was acting up,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.952
so I took him to the doctor.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.250
That's not interesting.

11:29.755 --> 11:33.092
And your father told me he
was going to the dog track.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.083
And that's where it gets interesting

11:35.795 --> 11:38.798
because after the doctor...

11:38.798 --> 11:41.801
we had lunch at the dog track.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.065
Let me just go check on your tea.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.074
Hey, Daph.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.075
Hello, Martin.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.776
How are your ears?

11:50.776 --> 11:51.777
Huh?

11:51.777 --> 11:52.778
How are your ears?!

11:52.778 --> 11:53.779
Dad, Dad.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.081
Here you go.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.782
I was just-- darling--
telling Daphne

11:56.782 --> 11:59.080
that I had lunch with
you at the dog track.

11:59.785 --> 12:00.786
Right.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.788
After the ear doctor.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.779
Right.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.117
And how about that flat
tire on the freeway?

12:09.795 --> 12:11.092
Niles helped me change it.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.100
All right, now I know you're lying.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.091
It all makes sense now.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.004
First you get me out of
the house with that spa,

12:19.004 --> 12:20.940
then this ridiculous story.

12:20.940 --> 12:21.941
You're throwing me

12:21.941 --> 12:23.431
a surprise baby shower
tonight, aren't you.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.934
 That's it. Yeah.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.935
But promise you'll look surprised

12:28.447 --> 12:29.949
when you come in through the door.

12:29.949 --> 12:33.953
Oh, Niles, you are
the sweetest man alive!

12:33.953 --> 12:35.955
Well, I should run.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.957
The party's tonight

12:37.957 --> 12:41.449
and I have one or two
finishing touches to tend to.

12:41.961 --> 12:42.962
Come along, Dad.

12:42.962 --> 12:43.963
Huh?

12:43.963 --> 12:45.453
Come along.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.466
Oh, you know, my ear
is really starting...

12:47.466 --> 12:48.956
Get in the car!

12:55.341 --> 12:56.842
ROZ: Hey, Niles.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.844
Not a bad party for two hours' notice.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.836
It's a disaster.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.350
None of Daphne's friends could make it.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.851
I told the caterer I
wanted a maternity motif.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.842
He thought I said
"fraternity, " and now we have

13:08.354 --> 13:10.345
three kegs of beer
and a six-foot hoagie.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.860
Great spread, Niles.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.362
Kenny Daly--
Frasier's boss.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.863
Roz invited me.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.365
 Sorry I didn't bring a present.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.855
Actually, you did--
a baby blanket.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.368
You'll find it in the pile on the table.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.869
Oh, great.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.871
Oh, by the way, your wife's a peach.

13:25.871 --> 13:26.860
My wife isn't here yet.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.934
Oh, no. Whose stomach did I just rub?

13:31.177 --> 13:35.214
Wow, Frasier, you're really
stuffing your pie hole.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.916
Look, I've had a very tough day.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.217
I'm entitled to a little comfort food

13:38.217 --> 13:39.919
before my evening appointment.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.222
(Frasier's stomach grumbling)

13:43.222 --> 13:45.213
That was pretty.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.222
I'll give you a tip, son.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.224
Tough nights on the force,
I used to eat like that.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.932
Trouble was, I'd be sitting
in the squad car all night,

13:52.932 --> 13:56.231
pants digging in, stomach
making unholy noises.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.938
There's only one thing that helps:

13:58.938 --> 14:01.240
Ioosen your belt and pop the top button.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.241
Thank you, Dad,

14:02.241 --> 14:04.903
for schooling me in the ancient ways.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.245
(laughing)

14:06.245 --> 14:07.913
Oh! Here she comes!

14:07.913 --> 14:09.915
Oh! Oh! Come on.

14:09.915 --> 14:10.904
(chuckling)

14:11.217 --> 14:12.206
Okay, okay.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.889
ALL: Surprise!

14:16.889 --> 14:18.190
My God, what a surprise!

14:18.190 --> 14:20.893
I've never been so surprised!

14:20.893 --> 14:23.195
Oh, thank you, Niles.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.891
All these people who mean so much to us.

14:26.098 --> 14:29.101
Mom and Frasier and...

14:29.101 --> 14:30.591
you.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.095
Our doorman.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.545
Doesn't he work with Frasier,
that m an at the big sandwich?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.548
Well, once word got
out, who was I to say no?

14:42.548 --> 14:43.549
Here, Daphne.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.551
I don't see many of my friends yet.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.553
Will Holly be coming? Margaret or Tina?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.054
Well, I had to make
the cutoff somewhere.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.557
Excuse me, darling.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.093
Would you come here.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.119
(loud gasping)

15:00.566 --> 15:02.056
(loud gasping)

15:02.568 --> 15:04.570
 Calm down, Niles. I can't.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.573
I'm telling her another lie
every time I open my mouth!

15:07.573 --> 15:12.067
Get a grip on yourself,
man! It's called marriage!

15:14.580 --> 15:15.569
Dr. Crane? Yes?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.082
I'm Esteban di Rojo.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.051
I am the lover of your ex-wife Maris.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.040
Uh, you've made a mistake.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.421
No, you have.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.957
What did you do that for?

15:24.957 --> 15:27.259
This ex-husband had
lunch with my Maris today.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.956
He gave her fool's advice,
and she was afoolto follow it.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.255
Are you all right?

15:39.972 --> 15:43.976
Niles, did you have
lunch with Maris today?

15:43.976 --> 15:46.278
Yes, I-I-I was just
about to tell...

15:46.278 --> 15:48.280
So you weren't planning
my shower at all.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.982
This whole party was just a sham.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.985
I'm so sorry. Not as sorry as I am.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.286
Daphne, Daphne, wait...

15:54.286 --> 15:55.988
I don't want to hear it.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.290
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.281
DOORMAN: Allow me.

16:09.001 --> 16:12.171
Dr. Crane, your appointment is here.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.174
Is your eye okay?
It's kind of twitching.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.005
Well, just a little
unfortunate accident.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.005
Uh... please, send her in. All right.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.316
Hi. Hello.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.318
I'm Shannon Palmer. Hello, Shannon

16:26.318 --> 16:28.020
Uh, please, won't you be seated.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.322
Uh, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.314
Uh... first of all, welcome.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.330
Whether our... journey
together lasts for years

16:38.330 --> 16:40.766
or... only just a day,

16:40.766 --> 16:44.303
I can't tell you how excited... I am...

16:44.303 --> 16:47.006
to take this first step with you.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.307
Okay. Uh...

16:48.307 --> 16:51.310
Geez, this is a little
hard to talk about.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.012
Oh, well, just relax.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.313
You know, many of my patients

16:54.313 --> 16:57.305
find it easier to open
up if they're lying down.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.007
Um... okay.

17:02.321 --> 17:08.027
Well... I guess I
have problems with men.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.755
No matter what they say,

17:09.261 --> 17:10.762
all they really seem to want is sex.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.253
(Frasier's stomach grumbling)

17:18.771 --> 17:21.272
It's hard, because I want to b
loved for who I am, of course,

17:21.272 --> 17:24.174
but if who I am is
an attractive woman...

17:24.410 --> 17:25.809
(stomach grumbling)

17:28.113 --> 17:30.149
What was that?

17:30.149 --> 17:32.351
It-it must be the, uh...

17:32.351 --> 17:35.047
the air-conditioning or something.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.449
Please, uh, continue.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.391
It's to the point now...

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
I meet

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
a perfectly nice man,
and I don't trust him.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.268
(phone rings)

17:49.268 --> 17:50.269
The machine'll get it.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.770
(machine beeps)

17:51.770 --> 17:54.306
This is Stephanie
Walsh. Remember? Milady?

17:54.306 --> 17:55.830
Sorry about my sister.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.200
You're not the first guy to
do something weird in bed.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.113
Oh!

18:04.349 --> 18:05.350
I'm so sor... Oh!

18:05.350 --> 18:06.852
Oh, good Lord! No!

18:06.852 --> 18:09.221
What the hell?!

18:09.221 --> 18:11.123
I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!

18:11.123 --> 18:12.624
(gasps)

18:12.624 --> 18:14.114
What is wrong with you?!

18:14.626 --> 18:15.615
It's not my fault.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.119
It's just a-a trick
I learned from my dad.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.500
You certainly know
how to keep 'em moving.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.238
Anyway, if you could sign
my timecard, I'll be going.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.247
Although if you...

18:35.247 --> 18:37.249
haven't hired anyone permanent yet...

18:37.249 --> 18:39.551
(sighs): Well, Peggy,

18:39.551 --> 18:41.553
I'm afraid I won'? really
be needing anybody permanent.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.423
Uh, I'm starting to think
this return to private practice

18:44.423 --> 18:45.891
was a big mistake.

18:45.891 --> 18:48.393
Everyone's first day is a little rough.

18:48.393 --> 18:51.396
Well, except mine. I didn't
even have to do any billing.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.385
(laughs)

18:54.399 --> 18:55.901
Nice meeting you.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.392
Nice meeting you, too.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.903
(heavy sigh)

19:14.386 --> 19:16.286
Dr. Crane? Yes?

19:16.788 --> 19:20.292
Uh... I was your 3:00 that canceled.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.261
I got cold feet.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.563
I was hoping maybe you
could squeeze me in.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.565
Oh, well, I was just
about to put this day

19:26.565 --> 19:28.260
out of its misery,
but, uh, please come in.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.568
Thanks.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.570
Hello. I'm Brad Kincaid.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.473
That's... not my real name.

19:34.473 --> 19:38.410
I'll just get it off
your insurance form.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.901
Why don't you have a seat, Brad.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.415
First of all, welcome.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.417
Whether this journey... Well, forget it.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.816
Uh...

19:49.254 --> 19:51.256
What's troubling you?

19:51.256 --> 19:54.560
Well, I just went
through a messy divorce,

19:54.560 --> 19:56.662
and my kid's in another city.

19:56.662 --> 20:00.265
I came here to begin a new career...

20:00.265 --> 20:01.500
but it's not happening for me,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.400
and I'm thinking maybe
I made a big mistake.

20:03.902 --> 20:04.869
You know, Brad,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.773
sometimes things take a little longer

20:07.773 --> 20:11.265
to turn in our favor
than we think they should.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.979
How long?

20:13.979 --> 20:16.848
Well, that depends.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.218
Tell me more. I'm listening.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.353
Okay.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.844
Well, I've been here
about six months now...

20:32.965 --> 20:34.466
Daphne...

20:34.466 --> 20:36.468
I am so sorry.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.958
It's all right.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.373
Well, not completely,

20:41.373 --> 20:43.375
but I'm not as mad as I was.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.877
I just don't understand
why you couldn't tell me ?

20:45.877 --> 20:47.367
you were having lunch with Maris.

20:47.879 --> 20:51.850
I was going to, but you were
just so upset when she called.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.319
I didn't know how you'd react.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.621
I suppose I have been

21:07.666 --> 21:10.035
I'm too tired to talk
about this right now.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.503
All I want is a nice cup
of tea and a warm bed.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.007
Coming up. One last word.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.510
I tell you, Maris will
never come between us again.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.513
MAN (over radio) : ... under
the baton of Sir Adrian Adler.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.015
And now, news headlines.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.382
Police have just arrested
Seattle socialite Maris Crane

21:26.752 --> 21:30.455
for the murder of her lover,
polo star Esteban di Rojo.

21:30.455 --> 21:36.291
Di Rojo was killed this evening
at Mrs. Crane's estate...
