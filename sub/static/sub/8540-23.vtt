00:01.958 --> 00:04.874
[indistinct chattering]

00:07.224 --> 00:10.358
You clean up very nicely,
if you don't mind me saying so.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.273
I don't mind you saying so.
Thanks.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.496
You look pretty much the same
as you always look.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.890
- Oh. Really?
- Yes.

00:20.977 --> 00:24.154
- This is my date outfit.
- Really?

00:24.241 --> 00:27.070
Is this your first date? I mean,
um, since your wife died?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.985
Do I seem out of practice?

00:29.072 --> 00:30.769
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.423
Uh, my name's Gerard. I'll be
your server this evening.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.685
Would you like
to hear our specials?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.296
I'm sorry
to interrupt, Gerard

00:35.383 --> 00:37.472
but I'm getting a message
from, uh, your mother.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.476
- A Janet no, um, Janis.
- Yes.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.522
Um..

00:45.741 --> 00:47.830
'I'm sorry for your loss.'

00:47.917 --> 00:49.962
She's happy now.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.532
And she wants you to know that
she sends her deepest love.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.926
And, um..

00:57.013 --> 01:02.192
...your uncle, Ed says,
"roll tide."

01:02.279 --> 01:06.109
Does that mean anything
to you, "roll tide"?

01:06.196 --> 01:09.243
[Gerard]
'My mother's brother Edward.
He died five years ago.'

01:09.330 --> 01:11.419
He was a tight end
at Alabama in the '60s.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.985
Oh.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.944
Uh, they're called
the Crimson Tide.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.207
Uh, that's their rallying cry,
"roll tide."

01:17.294 --> 01:18.556
Oh.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.080
Well, uh, I'd like to have

01:20.167 --> 01:23.083
the soup du jour
and the lamb, medium

01:23.170 --> 01:25.868
and the arugula salad
and the fish for the lady.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:28.653 --> 01:29.828
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.003
Thanks.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.007
[clears throat]

01:37.488 --> 01:40.796
- What?
- Oh, come on.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.233
You're so ferocious
in your lack of faith.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.802
I mean, is it so hard to imagine
that I'm not putting on an act?

01:46.889 --> 01:49.935
That, that I really am
what I say I am?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.590
His mother sent a message.
I'm meant to help. That's all.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.767
It happens to me
all the time.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.248
Okay.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.644
I'm sorry.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.733
Roll tide.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.039
[alert chimes]

02:10.304 --> 02:13.089
[telephone ringing]

02:13.176 --> 02:15.091
[sighs]

02:15.178 --> 02:17.528
Bad guys just
keep on coming, huh?

02:17.615 --> 02:20.009
I hate the internet.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.229
Listen, if you like,
I can deal. You go.

02:22.316 --> 02:25.188
No, it's okay.
It's just a web alert

02:25.275 --> 02:28.800
for when a name
we're interested in pops up.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.454
[clicking mouse]

02:36.634 --> 02:38.506
Wayne?

02:38.593 --> 02:39.811
What is it?

02:41.900 --> 02:43.032
Oh.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.822
This is not good.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.737
Relax, it's,
it's just a hoax.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.826
It's staged,
almost certainly.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.966
[intense music]

03:05.533 --> 03:06.795
[Van Pelt]
'Oh, my God!'

03:09.537 --> 03:10.973
[gasps]

03:15.630 --> 03:17.153
- I didn't put-- uh, no.
- Yes.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.199
[laughing]
No. no.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.679
- You went to jail, really?
- Yes, I did.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.594
- What's so hard to believe?
- For how long?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.944
I was there for two days
and two very luxurious nights.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.425
Uh-huh. Yeah.
And how'd you get out?

03:28.512 --> 03:30.079
- I just escaped.
- Uh-huh.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.820
I don't believe you
for one second.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.605
It wasn't, it wasn't that
difficult. It's all timing.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
Uh-huh.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.088
- I'm not kidding. Okay.
- Uh-huh.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.003
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.182
[laughing]

03:47.139 --> 03:48.271
Ah, thank you.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.016
[sighs]

04:07.943 --> 04:10.815
[instrumental music]

04:33.055 --> 04:35.927
[indistinct chattering]

04:39.279 --> 04:40.715
[sighs]
Hey.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.373
'Kristina, um..'

04:46.460 --> 04:47.983
[cellphone rings]

04:48.070 --> 04:49.985
Oh. I'm so sorry.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.294
[beep]
It's work. Hello.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.993
Jane, you need to come
to the office right now.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.563
[intense music]

05:07.176 --> 05:09.918
[theme music]

05:27.762 --> 05:30.634
[gasps and whimpers]

05:30.721 --> 05:33.202
[screaming]

05:34.508 --> 05:36.205
[video fast-forwarding]

05:38.338 --> 05:40.905
[music continues]

05:42.820 --> 05:44.431
it was posted on the internet
an hour ago

05:44.518 --> 05:46.171
on a popular notice board.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.696
There's a message
that goes with it.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.741
"I am becoming
what I was meant to be.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.483
'Your children's children
will worship me."'

05:53.570 --> 05:55.137
We don't know when or where
the video was made.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.660
There appears to be
an '08 Silverado

05:56.747 --> 05:58.096
parked outside the house

05:58.183 --> 06:00.708
so it's gotta be
at least that recent.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.405
Has Red John made videos

06:02.492 --> 06:03.798
or issued statements
like this before?

06:03.885 --> 06:05.887
- No.
- Oh, thank you.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.889
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.

06:07.976 --> 06:11.327
Oh. Hi, Kristina.
Uh, good to see you.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.417
Yeah. That poor girl.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.201
Yeah, yeah.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.160
For what it's worth
I'm getting a sense

06:18.247 --> 06:20.380
that she died very recently.

06:20.467 --> 06:24.427
Her body will be discovered
very soon. She's near water.

06:27.778 --> 06:30.215
Does this feel like
Red John to you?

06:30.302 --> 06:32.783
Uh, I'm not getting
a read on that.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.959
The whole internet aspect is
interesting, though, isn't it?

06:35.046 --> 06:36.613
I mean,
why put it up there?

06:36.700 --> 06:41.488
This clip's had over a million
viewers. A desire for fame?

06:41.575 --> 06:43.054
[Hightower]
'Patrick, you're
being very quiet.'

06:43.141 --> 06:44.621
What are you thinking?

06:44.708 --> 06:46.580
Uh, I'd have to see
the crime scene.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.060
CHP just reported
a homicide in the Bay Area.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.453
'Smiley face on the wall.'

06:50.540 --> 06:52.542
'College student
named Marley Sparrow.'

06:52.629 --> 06:55.066
'Roommate found her, called it
in about a half-hour ago.'

06:55.153 --> 06:56.154
Let's get ready to go.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.810
- Bay area?
- Uh, yes.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.334
That is close to water.
That's, uh, that's uncanny.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.859
Oh, come on.
That's pretty good.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.644
I am feeling a strong connection
to this case somehow.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.081
Madeline,
can we have a word, please?

07:10.168 --> 07:11.474
Yeah.

07:11.561 --> 07:12.562
[Hightower]
'Excuse us.'

07:15.957 --> 07:17.959
She's gonna ask
if she can come along with us.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.266
Now obviously, that's your call.
But I hope that you refuse

07:21.353 --> 07:23.834
because I won't work with her.
I will quit.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.881
What's your objection?
If she can help us, why not?

07:26.968 --> 07:29.884
Nothing she says
is more than clever guesswork.

07:29.971 --> 07:33.235
So she has essentially
the same skills as you.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.541
Without all the drama.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.369
What's the deal?

07:39.197 --> 07:40.503
Red John is mine.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.248
Okay. Okay, I hear you.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.336
[whispers]
Thank you.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.468
I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.121
- Oh, please.
- Uh..

07:52.559 --> 07:55.475
Um, I was going to offer
my services

07:55.562 --> 07:57.346
but I get the sense
Mr. Jane is telling you

07:57.433 --> 07:58.565
that he won't work with me.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.874
The last thing I want to do
is upset this investigation

08:03.961 --> 08:05.659
but if I have any more
feelings about the case

08:05.746 --> 08:06.747
could I call you?

08:06.834 --> 08:08.705
Of course, Kristina.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.055
Always be glad
to hear your thoughts.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.274
- Have a goodnight.
- Thank you.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.496
[whispers]
Okay.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.849
- Listen, uh, I--
- I completely understand.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.460
- No hard feelings.
- Okay.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.769
That was an unusual date,
though, huh?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.292
- Yes, very.
- Thank you.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.164
I'll see you soon,
I hope.

08:34.731 --> 08:35.950
[elevator bell rings]

08:36.037 --> 08:37.647
[elevator doors open]

08:37.734 --> 08:39.823
- Um, would you--
- Oh, yeah, sure.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.391
Oh.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.527
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.010
[indistinct radio chatter]

08:57.711 --> 09:00.235
[camera shutter clicking]

09:00.322 --> 09:01.584
Guys, give me
a minute, please.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.327
Thank you.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.246
[instrumental music]

09:22.953 --> 09:25.434
[whispers]
Hey, Marley. We'll get
this sorted out for you.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.786
[music continues]

09:45.759 --> 09:48.065
[indistinct radio chatter]

09:50.328 --> 09:52.330
Hey, hey,
Patrick Jane.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.419
Long time.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.596
'So, que pasa,dude?'

09:56.683 --> 09:58.859
My people need
to do their thing.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.948
I won't be long.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.210
Oh.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.430
[clears throat]

10:08.738 --> 10:13.003
'You hoovering up the, uh,
ol' psychic ectoplasm?'

10:13.090 --> 10:15.745
[makes buzzing sounds]

10:15.832 --> 10:18.705
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm doing.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.316
We have a schedule to keep,
amigo.Tick-tock.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.796
Sooner you're done
fooling around

10:22.883 --> 10:24.841
sooner my people can find
actual clues.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.063
She's from Iowa.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.979
She played the guitar.
She liked dark chocolate

10:32.066 --> 10:34.242
sudoku and snowboarding.

10:35.722 --> 10:39.464
Shy, but strong.
Honorable, modest.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.988
Didn't drink or smoke.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.121
Parents died
when she was very young.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.297
And after college,
she wanted to go into family law

10:46.384 --> 10:48.691
and help foster kids
like herself.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.564
Or become a singer.
She hadn't made up her mind yet.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.480
Yeah, that's great, dude.
But where's Red John?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.221
Oh, this wasn't Red John.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.658
So you say.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.313
So I say.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.189
[whispers]
Jerk.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.147
Oh, make sure
you have your people

11:10.234 --> 11:13.585
send those papers and journals
to the CBI office.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
- Will do.
- Thank you.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.853
[indistinct chattering]

11:24.509 --> 11:25.902
[sniffles]

11:34.563 --> 11:36.086
[female #1]
'Marley was the best.'

11:36.173 --> 11:38.001
'The best person.'

11:38.088 --> 11:39.829
A beautiful soul.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.876
[Lisbon]
'Ruth, you found her body, yes?'

11:42.963 --> 11:44.704
When you entered your house,
did you notice

11:44.791 --> 11:46.401
anything unusual
before you found the body?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.011
Something missing
or out of place?

11:48.098 --> 11:49.796
No, I don't think so.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.755
- How long had you been gone?
- Two days, snowboarding.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.845
Marley was supposed to come
but then her boyfriend

11:55.932 --> 11:57.978
was coming over to see her,
so she stayed.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.415
- Boyfriend's name?
- Grady Shipp.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.199
He's a policeman
in San Francisco.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.900
They've been dating
for, like, a month.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.858
Okay. What was he like?
Nice guy?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.773
Marley really liked him
a lot.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.557
Said he was super nice.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.646
But I don't know.
We never actually met him.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.996
No?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.433
She'd go to his place,
mostly.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.523
And when he came by here,
he'd wait for her in his car.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.264
Weird, no?

12:23.351 --> 12:26.006
I think Marley was
a bit embarrassed

12:26.093 --> 12:28.704
for hooking up with a cop,
you know?

12:28.791 --> 12:30.575
So she kept him
on the down low.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.534
Embarrassed, why?

12:32.621 --> 12:35.450
Marley was cool.

12:35.537 --> 12:38.279
And, well, cops are sort of
nerds with guns, aren't they?

12:38.366 --> 12:40.324
Ruth, hello?

12:41.673 --> 12:42.674
No offense.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.461
[laughing]
Sorry.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.115
'Marley sparrow?'

12:48.202 --> 12:51.640
Yes, I was her academic advisor
for two semesters.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.294
Nice enough girl,

12:53.381 --> 12:56.340
but not as clever
as she likes to think she is.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.342
But none of 'em are,
are they? Ha!

12:58.429 --> 13:00.649
Did you notice any changes
in her behavior recently?

13:00.736 --> 13:03.304
No. But nor do I
pay close attention.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.523
They're all empty vessels
to be filled with knowledge.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.526
Here is
a horrible coincidence.

13:08.613 --> 13:12.400
Last semester, I taught
a criminology elective.

13:12.487 --> 13:17.666
Murder, myth and marketing,
the serial killer as commodity.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.364
Red John
was actually mentioned

13:20.451 --> 13:22.845
in our class discussions.
Isn't that eerie?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.760
Who mentioned him?
What'd they say?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.718
Oh, damned if I know.
It was eight or nine months ago.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.372
Do you have a student list
from the class?

13:28.459 --> 13:31.419
You know, I do.
I do. Somewhere.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.857
[lowered voice]
I do.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.554
We would love
to get a look at that list.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.168
[indistinct chattering]

13:41.255 --> 13:42.909
Thanks.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.606
So there's no Grady Shipp
with any San Fran Police Agency.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.825
There's no
Grady Shipp, period.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.087
There was
a Grady Shipp once.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.697
He killed and ate
his next-door neighbors

13:48.784 --> 13:51.221
in little rock back in the '90s.
He was lethally injected

13:51.308 --> 13:53.136
by the state of Arkansas
in '02.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.095
Huh. So Marley's boyfriend
doesn't want anybody

13:55.182 --> 13:57.662
to see his face, and he named
himself after a cannibal.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.099
'That's two strikes
against him.'

13:59.186 --> 14:00.927
Shame we don't have
a name or a description.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.059
The roommate, Ruth, said that
he never got out of his car.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.669
Maybe we can get
a make and model from her.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.629
Grady Shipp.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.893
In 1989, he did a 6-month spell
in the same wing

14:10.980 --> 14:12.634
at Lompoc as Orval Tanner.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.549
- Orval Tanner?
- Red John's friend.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.813
You have the entire Lompoc
Prison registry in your head?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.120
Well, only
the relevant sections.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.730
[Lisbon]
'Wh-what does it mean?
Is it a joke?'

14:21.817 --> 14:23.340
[Rigsby]
'Marley's boyfriend
is Red John.'

14:23.427 --> 14:24.776
[Cho]
'That doesn't make
any sense.'

14:26.866 --> 14:29.825
In the hunt for this beast
known as "Red John."

14:31.871 --> 14:33.960
well, he--
he's not a beast, Jackie.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.526
He's a human being.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.441
Now he has done
terrible things

14:37.528 --> 14:39.443
but he is still
capable of redemption..

14:40.705 --> 14:41.881
...like all of us.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.105
Red John..

14:49.192 --> 14:50.715
...if you're listening
to us now

14:50.802 --> 14:54.328
I urge you to reach out
and get help.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.808
You can change.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.115
[indistinct chattering]

15:01.161 --> 15:03.859
[instrumental music]

15:14.870 --> 15:16.437
What the hell
are you thinking?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.569
Don't you understand
who you're dealing with?

15:18.656 --> 15:20.006
I do understand, yes.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.617
No, you don't. Clearly,
you don't understand.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.314
I asked Miss Frye here

15:24.401 --> 15:26.360
so that I could fully
express my deep dismay.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.057
I was speaking
from the heart.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.060
That may be, but you were also
hustling for business.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.671
'And that's okay, but you
present me now with a problem.'

15:35.456 --> 15:37.501
We don't have any obligation
to protect you, but--

15:37.588 --> 15:40.200
I wasn't asking for protection.
It's completely unnecessary.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.810
Red John
is not coming after me.

15:41.897 --> 15:45.074
Are you blind?
You've done exactly what I did.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.990
I went on television and talked
about him as though I knew him

15:48.077 --> 15:49.774
and he killed
my wife and child.

15:49.861 --> 15:53.691
Patrick, he was punishing you
because you lied about him.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.868
'I was telling the truth.
He won't take offense with me.'

15:56.956 --> 15:58.479
He might even listen
to what I said.

15:58.566 --> 15:59.959
In fact,
I-I believe he will.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.311
People do change, Patrick.
It's possible.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.316
Agent Hightower, I'm truly
sorry for dismaying you.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.842
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some other appointments.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.893
[inhales deeply]
She needs 24-hour protection.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.853
The best that you can provide.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.768
The Sac PD
Special Protection Unit

16:26.855 --> 16:29.379
will provide security,
the CBI will be on the inside

16:29.466 --> 16:32.078
bodyguarding Miss Frye. Jane
and I will take the first shift.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.254
The next 24-hour rotation
will be split among us

16:34.341 --> 16:36.169
alternating with
the Sparrow case.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.258
Well, we're gonna have to stop
protecting her sooner or later.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.260
That's when he'll go for her.
He'll just wait.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.696
Van Pelt,
what do you got?

16:41.783 --> 16:43.698
We're looking
for Grady Shipp, right?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.526
This is
Marley's address book.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.007
That's different writing. Maybe
that's Grady Shipp himself.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.834
- Can I?
- 'Keep digging.'

16:49.921 --> 16:51.271
Rigsby, take Cho with you.
Check it out.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.663
Yeah, you got it.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.410
[clank]

17:00.497 --> 17:01.629
Hello?

17:05.285 --> 17:07.026
[door creaking]

17:12.292 --> 17:14.946
[flapping sounds]

17:19.734 --> 17:21.127
Hello?

17:23.172 --> 17:26.045
[intense music]

17:40.755 --> 17:42.104
[sighs]

17:44.324 --> 17:46.935
[music continues]

17:52.245 --> 17:53.376
- Blood.
- Yep.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.990
[exhales]
Pig's blood, maybe.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.168
For practice?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.908
[footsteps approaching

18:03.995 --> 18:07.434
[gunshots]

18:07.521 --> 18:09.088
[panting]

18:10.828 --> 18:13.396
[intense music]

18:15.094 --> 18:16.312
Police! Stop!

18:18.749 --> 18:20.360
Hey! Stop!

18:31.022 --> 18:33.112
[engine revving]

18:33.721 --> 18:34.809
Damn!

18:36.811 --> 18:38.160
I'll call it in.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.684
[panting]

18:45.428 --> 18:47.343
What is it?

18:47.430 --> 18:49.998
A lens cap.
Interesting.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.826
Practicing
the Red John symbol

18:51.913 --> 18:54.524
and not just watching us
pursue him

18:54.611 --> 18:56.396
but filming the pursuit.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.180
What does it mean?

18:58.267 --> 19:00.835
It means Marley Sparrow's
killer loves cameras.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.794
He's a voyeur, a fanboy,
a slasher movie geek.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.405
Huh.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.321
Great. But where does
that take us now? Like in a car?

19:08.408 --> 19:10.888
Well, try
the campus film club.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.063
Alright.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.981
Nice place, huh?
Tasteful.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.419
To me, it looks like we're
about to pay way too much money

19:19.506 --> 19:20.463
to get our legs waxed.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.422
- Hmm.
- Hi.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.511
I was just making some lunch.
Would you like something to eat?

19:24.598 --> 19:25.860
Sure, thanks.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.384
I'm good.
Thanks.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.213
Patrick, uh,
on reflection

19:31.300 --> 19:33.868
I'm truly sorry
for the situation I put you in.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.174
I hadn't thought through
your involvement.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.176
Alright, alright.
I-I-I'll eat some lunch.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.481
Just please
don't make a fuss.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.790
Miss Ketchum?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.835
[gasps]
Oh, policemen.

19:44.922 --> 19:48.143
Okay. I knew
I'd forgotten something. Uh..

19:48.230 --> 19:50.319
Okay.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.973
There it is.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.801
I thought
for sure I'd sent that.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.846
- Sent what?
- Uh, the class list.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.632
Of the students
in my criminology class.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.155
Your colleague
had asked for it.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.070
And you're chair
of the film club also?

20:02.157 --> 20:04.551
I have that honor.
You know what?

20:04.638 --> 20:07.206
I have the film club register
here as well.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.557
Okay. Yes, yes.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.993
Would you like to see it?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.300
Yes. That would be,
uh, good.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.215
Okay.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.607
Ah, there you go.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.004
And where were you
Tuesday night, Miss Ketchum?

20:25.136 --> 20:27.704
Oh, how thrilling!

20:27.791 --> 20:30.403
- Am I a suspect?
- Are you?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.231
Well..

20:32.318 --> 20:34.972
I'd like to think I can still
summon that kind of passion.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.279
So where were you?

20:37.366 --> 20:39.499
Home. Alone.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.892
Reading a murder mystery,
actually.

20:41.979 --> 20:45.331
Now there's only one name
on both lists. Wesley Blankfein.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.898
Oh, wait.
You just made a face.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.466
Well, he is a sweet boy.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.947
Rather a good actor, actually.

20:53.034 --> 20:56.124
- But, uh, strange.
- Strange? How?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.865
I can't really
put my finger on it.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.868
It's a look in his eyes.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.826
[male #1]
Yep, that's him.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.176
I remember when he moved in.
I mentioned to him

21:05.264 --> 21:07.657
he was a little older
than most of our students

21:07.744 --> 21:09.877
and he said he needed to escape
from his mother.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.270
[laughs]

21:11.357 --> 21:12.706
[clears throat]

21:12.793 --> 21:15.012
Which, uh, I thought
was an odd response.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.492
And when
did you last see him?

21:16.579 --> 21:18.277
- Uh, three weeks ago..
- Excuse me.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.409
Uh, maybe. I figured
he had a girlfriend.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.283
- 'Nothing here.'
- Oh, hey, Dylan.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.936
[Cho]
'Oh, hey, you guys.
Quick question.'

21:26.023 --> 21:27.198
Now you guys said
Marley's boyfriend

21:27.286 --> 21:28.243
waited for her
outside in a car?

21:28.330 --> 21:29.940
Yes.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.681
Do you recall
what type of car he drove?

21:31.768 --> 21:34.858
Um, it was black, I think.
I'm bad with cars.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.773
It was a,
it was a black SUV.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.472
- What car did Blankfein drive?
- Uh, he didn't have a car.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.954
Huh. Okay.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.869
Try locating
Blankfein's mother.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.915
Maybe she knows where he is.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.047
Alright. Let me know.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.658
Wesley Blankfein's
in the wind.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.442
Looks like
he might be good for this.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.835
I don't think so.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.227
Marley made contact with me.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
The name "Blankfein"
doesn't resonate.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.841
- Marley made contact with you?
- Yes.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.583
Of course. Uh, I think

22:03.670 --> 22:07.108
we might have had enough of your
crime-fighting skills, Kristina.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.240
Might be best to stick
to the crystal therapy

22:09.328 --> 22:12.243
and the, uh...foot massages?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.593
- Reflexology.
- Right.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.159
[phone ringing]
'Reflexology.'

22:18.249 --> 22:20.164
This is Lisbon.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.906
[Fenton]
'Agent Fenton, FBI.
Yeah, we got a case'

22:22.993 --> 22:24.734
here in Lake Tahoe.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.606
Looks like your boy Red John.

22:26.693 --> 22:30.436
Victim's name is
a Jacqueline Sandoval.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.438
'You wanna come take a look?'

22:37.181 --> 22:38.748
You can smile
your arrogant smile

22:38.835 --> 22:40.794
and act like you know
everything about everything

22:40.881 --> 22:42.578
but you don't.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.667
There are whole worlds that you
can't even begin to understand.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.190
Synchronized swimming

22:46.277 --> 22:47.931
is, uh, the only world
that springs to mind.

22:48.018 --> 22:51.457
But I'm sure you're right.
There may be many others.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.807
What's the matter?

22:53.894 --> 22:56.287
Red John killed the woman
who interviewed you.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.856
Oh, my God.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.122
Oh, my God.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.654
[dramatic music]

23:51.342 --> 23:52.474
[indistinct radio chatter]

23:54.781 --> 23:56.522
It's Red John, alright.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.219
Okay, uh, I'll reach out
to the feds.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.655
I'll make sure
they keep us in the loop.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.483
We gotta get back
to Kristina Frye's place.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.312
There are cops all around
her house. Van Pelt is with her

24:04.399 --> 24:07.663
and there's other CBI agents
on their way. She's safe.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.665
I am confident
Red John's not gonna go there.

24:09.752 --> 24:13.539
- That is exactly why he might.
- If he does, we'll get him.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.149
You really wanna hang out
at Kristina's house

24:15.236 --> 24:16.890
waiting for Red John
to show up?

24:16.977 --> 24:18.239
Let's just go back
to the office

24:18.326 --> 24:19.588
and we'll work
the Marley Sparrow case.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.895
There's nothing useful
that I can do there.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.158
This Blankfein character,
he looks good for it, right?

24:24.245 --> 24:26.856
Fine. Go and wait for Red John.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.206
It's not a good idea, though.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.643
Hey, we're in Nevada.

24:30.730 --> 24:34.734
You can't just walk off
and leave me here.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.171
- Hey.
- 'Hey, boss.

24:37.258 --> 24:40.174
So Wesley Blankfein's mother
is Myra Hauser-Blankfein.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.610
Address in Franklin Heights.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.699
And she owns a black SUV
like Grady Shipp drives.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.440
Good. Go check her out.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.529
Now? Well, it's
a long drive.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.010
You leave now,
you'll be there by the morning.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.188
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:56.756 --> 24:59.628
[instrumental music]

25:10.596 --> 25:12.423
Grace, thank you.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.214
How you doing?

25:20.301 --> 25:21.650
I'm doing fine.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.613
Red John certainly
made his point.

25:27.700 --> 25:31.094
Quite possibly,
he'll leave things be now.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.619
I know he will.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.534
I have a clear vision of him.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.145
'He needs to create fear,
that's all.'

25:38.232 --> 25:40.364
He's done that now,
and he feels calm.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.801
'And I'm perfectly safe.'

25:41.888 --> 25:44.064
Will you just stop
that nonsense?

25:45.805 --> 25:47.241
You wanted to promote
your psychic business

25:47.328 --> 25:48.808
and, and you made
a big mistake.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.680
Now will you just,
will you please just own it?

25:51.767 --> 25:53.116
Why are you here?

25:53.203 --> 25:55.162
I am here because
I want to protect you.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.772
And how are you
gonna protect me?

25:56.859 --> 25:58.469
If Red John comes through
that door right now

25:58.557 --> 25:59.819
what are you gonna do,
hypnotize him?

25:59.906 --> 26:02.212
I will do what I need to do.

26:02.299 --> 26:05.259
If Red John wants
to reach me, he will.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.348
I choose to believe
that he doesn't want to.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.698
- Now please, go away.
- I'm gone.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.755
[door closes]

26:25.627 --> 26:27.803
Uh, you're wasting your time.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.849
Ma'am, we're looking
for Mrs. Blankfein and her son.

26:29.936 --> 26:33.026
Gone. And left the cats
to starve. It's not right.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.244
Do you know where they went?

26:34.331 --> 26:37.117
Uh, nope.
Never leaves before. Never.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.859
Every day, 11 o'clock,
like a machine

26:39.946 --> 26:41.861
she's watching her TV shows.

26:41.948 --> 26:46.300
Three days now I hear nothing.
Quiet like the grave.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.867
How about her son Wesley?
Have you seen him?

26:47.954 --> 26:49.216
Nope. Gone, too.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.565
Did it occur to you

26:50.652 --> 26:51.740
that Mrs. Blankfein
might be dead in there?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.873
Yes, it did.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.963
But there'd be a smell,
wouldn't there, if she was dead?

27:00.053 --> 27:02.664
Step back inside,
please, ma'am.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.231
- You good?
- Yeah.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.060
[meowing]

27:08.496 --> 27:10.890
[meowing]

27:17.113 --> 27:20.464
[Wayne]
'Bedroom's clear.'

27:20.551 --> 27:21.640
[Kimball]
'Rigsby.'

27:26.296 --> 27:29.299
Oh, jeez.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.997
"G.S" Grady Shipp.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.086
Bingo.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.307
Inside the mind
of Wesley Blankfein..

27:37.394 --> 27:40.223
- AKA Grady Shipp.
- Not pretty.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.661
It looks like he's obsessed
with Marley

27:42.748 --> 27:44.184
so he builds a shrine

27:44.271 --> 27:46.229
and he fakes up all these photos
of them together.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.014
'Then he tries to turn
the fantasy into reality'

27:48.101 --> 27:50.494
'and posing as Grady Shipp,
he asks her out'

27:50.581 --> 27:53.672
'and she says yes. Big mistake.
Fantasy and reality collide'

27:53.759 --> 27:54.890
and she dies.

27:54.977 --> 27:56.457
[Teresa]
'Sounds about right.'

27:56.544 --> 27:58.981
Where the hell is he?
Uh, where's his mom?

27:59.068 --> 28:00.679
You didn't find anything
useful in the apartment?

28:00.766 --> 28:02.768
- No computer, nothing?
- No. A lot of cats.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.421
Now the pictures of Marley,
they were all taken

28:04.508 --> 28:06.946
at different times and places.
The pictures of Wesley

28:07.033 --> 28:08.817
were all taken
in the same place.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.166
'Nowhere we've been.'

28:10.253 --> 28:11.298
Maybe that's
a safe house for him.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.039
Nothing to say
where it is, though.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.823
- Jane, you wanna take a look?
- Huh?

28:14.910 --> 28:17.826
See if you see anything useful?

28:17.913 --> 28:19.349
Yeah, sure.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.003
If you like.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.966
[instrumental music]

28:39.587 --> 28:41.502
Hmm.

28:41.589 --> 28:44.418
- Yep.
- And..

28:44.505 --> 28:46.550
There's a photo of Wesley
with a sign in the distance

28:46.637 --> 28:48.901
a yellow KC
backward on a pole.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.251
His, his shadow
is pointing right to it.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.518
[Wayne]
'Yeah. It's way small
back there, but I see it.'

28:57.605 --> 28:59.694
Yeah, that's the logo
for Kenny's Chili..

28:59.781 --> 29:01.565
Southern California
fast food chain.

29:01.652 --> 29:02.610
There's about 50 or so outlets.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.177
You memorize trademarks?

29:04.264 --> 29:06.570
Well, with Wesley's long shadow
and the golden light

29:06.657 --> 29:09.660
that would say afternoon.
And sun is in the West

29:09.748 --> 29:13.752
so that puts Kenny's
due East of this location

29:13.839 --> 29:15.971
about a block and a half,
I'd say.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.930
Huh. He's right.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.932
50 or so outlets?

29:20.019 --> 29:20.976
Hardware store
and a liquor store

29:21.063 --> 29:22.151
on the block right next to it.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.544
That should narrow it down.

29:23.631 --> 29:24.937
I'll get on it.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.201
- Thank you.
- Oh. No.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.771
You should make that call.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.642
- What call?
- Right.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.644
Like I'm not
a detective, too?

29:51.877 --> 29:54.662
Hey, Jane. It's Grace.
Kristina's taking a nap.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.055
'I can get her for you
if you like.'

29:56.142 --> 29:58.231
I'd appreciate that, Grace.
Thank you.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.061
Kristina?

30:04.541 --> 30:07.066
Kristina,
it's Jane for you.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.113
Open the door.

30:13.594 --> 30:16.379
Kristina? Kristina?

30:20.557 --> 30:23.865
'Kristina?'

30:23.952 --> 30:25.432
'Kristina!'

30:32.004 --> 30:33.309
How did Kristina
get past the guards?

30:33.396 --> 30:35.181
We don't know.
But she also packed a bag

30:35.268 --> 30:37.096
she took her passport
and her credit cards

30:37.183 --> 30:38.880
so we can
assume she wasn't abducted.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.013
No, no, no. You, you,
you can't assume.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.841
Red John could've gotten
in and taken her.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.538
Maybe. But the likelihood is

30:44.625 --> 30:46.279
she panicked
and ran somewhere to hide.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.542
Yeah. Or, or, or maybe
he lured her out somehow.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.631
We'll check
the phone records.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.851
Let's start contacting
her relatives and friends.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.287
She's out there somewhere.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.680
Forgive me, Agent Lisbon,
but belay that order.

30:56.767 --> 30:59.118
The search for Kristina Frye
will now be conducted

30:59.205 --> 31:00.554
by the missing persons unit.

31:00.641 --> 31:01.816
What?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.992
They're the best
at what they do.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.473
They will find her
if she can be found.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.563
And, Van Pelt, snap out of it.
Wasn't your fault.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.434
- Yes, ma'am, but--
- 'Move on.'

31:14.220 --> 31:16.439
Alright. Where are we
on the Marley Sparrow case?

31:16.526 --> 31:20.313
We have a suspect at large
by the name of Wesley Blankfein.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.229
He's been obsessed with both
Red John and Marley Sparrow.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.318
He seems to have created
an alter ego

31:25.405 --> 31:27.407
by the name of Grady Shipp.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.322
'It's after a killer
with Red John connections.'

31:29.409 --> 31:31.019
Any leads?

31:31.106 --> 31:32.978
Well, off photos he took, we've
ID'd six possible locations

31:33.065 --> 31:34.980
for what we assume
is Blankfein's safe house.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.025
It's pretty much a long shot,
but it's all we have.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.592
Okay. Alright. Go to it.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.333
Let's start
divvying up the locations.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.466
Cho, you take riverside county.
Bring Rigsby with you.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.513
Van pelt and I will take
the San Bernardino locations.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.820
Jane, you stay here.
Take a break.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.214
- I don't need a break.
- I think you do.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.260
I-I-I'd rather keep active.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.305
You're too hyped up
to be out in the field.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.133
- Oh, that's nonsense.
- I agree with Lisbon.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.613
Get some rest.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.789
Some rest? Oh, just..

32:01.876 --> 32:04.183
[chuckles]
Lie down and catch up
on some Zs.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.403
Kick back with
a good book. Rest?

32:07.490 --> 32:08.796
- I'm fine.
- Debatable.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.668
Do you want me to ask
the psych counselor

32:11.755 --> 32:12.931
for an evaluation?

32:21.156 --> 32:24.029

33:24.263 --> 33:25.394
Sorry.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.488

- 'Sure. You got it, hon.'

'Leave a message.
I'll call you back.'

33:51.290 --> 33:53.596
Lisbon, it's Jane.
Uh, I found it.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.859
It's 52 North Esperanza.

33:55.946 --> 33:59.211
Hotel Del Dorona
in Salinger Mill.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.039
Uh, I am gonna..

34:03.867 --> 34:08.785
Uh, I-I'm gonna wait for you
at, uh, Kenny's okay?

34:08.872 --> 34:11.092
Give me a call
when you get this message.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.311
Thank you.

I'm Grady Shipp.

35:38.179 --> 35:41.356
'So good of you
to come visit me.'

35:41.443 --> 35:43.837
You're a lucky man.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.448
Very lucky.

35:46.535 --> 35:50.278
Tonight, you will have
the dying honor..

35:53.063 --> 35:55.153
Can we do that again?

35:56.937 --> 35:58.112
Tonight..

35:59.766 --> 36:01.681
...you will have
the honor of dying

36:02.812 --> 36:04.118
'as a sacrifice'

36:04.205 --> 36:07.295
to the holy master,
Red John.

36:10.298 --> 36:13.258
Behold, the blood sacrament

36:14.302 --> 36:15.912
of the master.

36:17.653 --> 36:21.135
Stop. You wanna try
that again?

36:21.222 --> 36:22.789
Huh?

36:22.876 --> 36:25.444
Just t-try it again.
Uh, say it like you mean it.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.489
You know,
where's the passion gone?

36:27.576 --> 36:29.970
Behold the blood sacrament
of the master.

36:30.057 --> 36:33.103
'Oh, n-n-no. I'm not.. I'm not..
I'm not buying it. Come on.'

36:33.191 --> 36:34.844
Just, just stop for a sec

36:34.931 --> 36:36.629
and think, think about
what you're doing here

36:36.716 --> 36:39.197
and then we'll start again
from the top, okay?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.808
Uh..

36:41.895 --> 36:43.288
It's alright, Wesley.
I know what's going on.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.464
They've got your mother,
don't they?

36:46.769 --> 36:48.162
Yeah. How'd you know?

36:48.249 --> 36:49.555
They're forcing you
to play a part

36:49.642 --> 36:50.773
in their sick little movie.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.949
Yes.

36:53.036 --> 36:55.909
You're playing the part
of Grady Shipp, right?

36:56.736 --> 36:57.824
Yes.

36:57.911 --> 37:00.043
It's okay. It's okay.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.395
Dylan! Ruth!

37:05.353 --> 37:07.399
We need to talk.

37:07.486 --> 37:11.054
Thank you very much
for totally ruining

37:11.141 --> 37:13.927
a freaking brilliant scene,
you jerk.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.495
Hush, Dyl.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.455
How did you know
it was us?

37:20.542 --> 37:23.110
Well, you were the only people
that mentioned Grady Shipp.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.720
He was your creation.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.461
And it was you
that killed Marley

37:26.548 --> 37:28.550
'wasn't it, Dylan?'

37:31.031 --> 37:33.686
Wesley couldn't hurt a fly.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.254
It was a truly sick individual
that did that.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.735
It was me, actually.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.084
Oh.

37:41.171 --> 37:43.739
'Dyl's much better
with the camera'

37:43.826 --> 37:46.873
and Marley,
deserved what she got.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.658
Pious little bitch.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.357
Keep the camera running.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.881
This is all good stuff.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.186
no offense, but you
wouldn't know good stuff

37:56.274 --> 37:57.579
if it smacked you in the face.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.668
This is just
a corny slasher movie.

37:59.755 --> 38:05.152
Yeah, but real, dude.
Real blood. Real guts.

38:05.239 --> 38:08.329
Yours. Wesley, let's, uh,
wrap this scene up now, okay?

38:08.416 --> 38:09.548
Gonna pick it up
right at the end

38:09.635 --> 38:10.853
behold the blood, etcetera

38:10.940 --> 38:12.638
and then stab
this sucker, okay?

38:12.725 --> 38:13.856
[laughing]

38:16.032 --> 38:18.383
- 'I don't know.'
- That's it.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.167
What? Wh-what are you?
Not.. No!

38:20.254 --> 38:22.648
Okay, this, this man is dead.
Okay, the only question is

38:22.735 --> 38:25.651
'whether you and your mom want
to live or you want to die'

38:25.738 --> 38:27.174
'like him, okay?
That's your choice here.'

38:27.261 --> 38:29.002
These people are nuttier
than a fruitcake.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.047
'They're gonna kill
you regardless.'

38:31.134 --> 38:34.137
- 'You don't have to do this.'
- We are not monsters, Wesley.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.531
We're artists!

38:37.706 --> 38:39.665
'We are making art.'

38:41.493 --> 38:42.581
When the movie's done
of course

38:42.668 --> 38:44.887
you and your mom
are free to go

38:44.974 --> 38:47.716
with our gratitude
for your help.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.327
Stay calm.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.547
Behold the blood.
Wesley.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.339
I'm sorry.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.906
Wesley.
Wesley, Wesley, hey.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.952
- Behold..
- No, Wesley.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.562
The blood sacrament..

39:07.649 --> 39:08.607
- No. It's okay.
- 'Of the master!'

39:08.694 --> 39:09.651

I can't tolerate'

39:38.071 --> 39:40.203

of my work.'

39:43.772 --> 39:45.861

40:04.140 --> 40:05.925

41:08.814 --> 41:12.078
'Kristina would want me
to send her love.'

41:14.341 --> 41:17.953
'She's very fond of you
despite your differences.'

42:00.779 --> 42:02.737
Yeah, I'm fine.

42:02.824 --> 42:05.435
You're sure
he said nothing?

42:05.523 --> 42:07.046
Nothing at all?

42:07.133 --> 42:09.048
