WEBVTT

00:58.480 --> 00:59.470
Mr. Nygaard?

00:59.800 --> 01:00.870
Oh, you betcha.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.354
Yeah.
She's a beaut.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.757
Got the low-water feature,
but don't skimp on torque.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.314
Am I taking the old one?

01:12.400 --> 01:15.393
Yeah, if that's...
They said on the phone
it'd be no problem.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.358
Oh, sure.
It's no problem.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.560
The T-160? Hmm, yeah.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.710
Geez. I see why
you're trading her in.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.917
She's a real lemon.
Motor mount.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.755
Chinese used plastic screws.
Bet she bucked like a bronco.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.036
You do not know
the half of it.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.710
Stopped making
'em pretty quick.
Recalled, I think.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.990
Surprised to see her,
truth be told.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.316
You'd be better off washing
your clothes
between two rocks.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.516
You know what I mean?

02:24.240 --> 02:27.711
They got Chaz up
at Faribault till
the trial.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.559
Gordo's at Red Wing.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.433
Which is...

02:32.560 --> 02:35.997
Well, you know...
At least they're close.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.232
His lawyer thinks
we can plea it
down to probation.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.033
Time served.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.110
For murder?

02:42.200 --> 02:43.793
No, Gordo...

02:43.920 --> 02:46.037
On the gun charge.
Oh, yeah.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.319
Chaz? Well, good riddance.
Don't care what that man gets.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.909
No, sir,
not after what he did.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.880
Killing my wife,
you mean?

02:55.960 --> 02:59.317
Oh, well, yeah.
Yeah, of course, that.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.760
But also...

03:02.600 --> 03:04.239
Well, I mean,
look at me.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.236
I was Miss Hubbard County,
for Pete's sake.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.591
You don't cheat on
Miss Hubbard County.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.638
I just don't
believe it,
you know.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.275
I mean,
just three weeks ago,

03:20.400 --> 03:24.792
we were sitting
around the table
eating ham.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.596
And now Gordo's having
his night terrors again.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.195
Plus,
we have to sell everything
to pay the legal bills.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.672
Did you know...
Chaz bought
a time share in a boat?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.110
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.600
Yeah, it's a thing.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.638
So if there's anything
from the house you want...

03:44.760 --> 03:48.436
You know, like
I was thinking maybe
Chaz's hunting gear?

03:48.520 --> 03:52.719
I boxed it up for you.
Not sure
it's anything you want.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.156
Oh, sure.
That'd be fine,
thank you.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.233
Well...
listen, if there's
anything I can do.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.630
Oh, no...
Lester,
you are so sweet.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.439
I am the one who
should be saying that

04:18.519 --> 04:21.319
after what he did
to you, my husband.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.234
Oh, what'd you get?

04:24.360 --> 04:28.070
New washer.
The old one...

04:28.200 --> 04:31.432
Well, I had to get rid of
everything from the basement.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.239
On account of all the...

04:34.280 --> 04:35.509
You deserve it, Lester.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.034
All good things.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.474
You deserve.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.760
Back to it then?

05:58.920 --> 06:02.277
Looks like. Doc
cleared me for duty, so...

06:05.800 --> 06:07.951
More flowers came
for you from Duluth.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.951
A smarter man
would think you
were being wooed.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.192
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.194
Put 'em up where we
can see 'em at least.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.796
So, you got a strategy
on this Lester thing?

06:32.880 --> 06:35.634
Well, I'm just gonna walk in
and say, "Bill..."

06:35.760 --> 06:37.433
If you think it's best...

06:38.240 --> 06:39.469
Direct approach.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.110
Your point being?

06:43.240 --> 06:44.230
Got no point.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.917
Okay. Bye, Dad.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.879
Chief, are you busy?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.235
What's that?

07:11.320 --> 07:15.712
Said, "Are you busy?"
Got a request for
your attendance.

07:15.800 --> 07:20.079
Can it wait?
I just ate an omelet...
Waiting for it to digest.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.675
Oh, yeah?
What kind?

07:22.760 --> 07:25.036
It was mushrooms
and cheese.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.192
Sally make it?
Yeah.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.840
She wrapped it
in tin foil to
keep it warm.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.471
Molly needs you
is the thing.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.671
Asked me to see
if you'd come down
to the staff room.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.160
She's back already?

07:39.240 --> 07:40.833
Yeah.
Hmm.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.354
Thought I had another day.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.070
All right.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.629
Let's go see what
we're gonna do today.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.954
There she is,
the gunfighter.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.434
Hey, Chief.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.160
Nice collage, you take up
basket weaving too
in your downtime?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.273
Yeah, it's just
some loose ends
I wanted to...

08:05.360 --> 08:08.671
Molly, before you...
I want you to know...

08:08.800 --> 08:11.156
I'm not too proud
to say I was wrong

08:11.240 --> 08:14.278
on the Lester case.
I had the wrong idea.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.113
I thought it was
a drifter thing.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.079
Which was the wrong
way to go, clearly.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.517
But, you know,
some good police work,
and we caught the guy, so...

08:24.200 --> 08:25.429
That's the problem,

08:25.520 --> 08:27.273
actually, um...

08:28.360 --> 08:29.350
Is that you're still...

08:29.440 --> 08:31.272
Still what?

08:33.919 --> 08:34.990
Wrong.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.710
I mean, no disrespect.
It's just...

08:39.799 --> 08:43.476
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean, the brother?

08:43.559 --> 08:45.631
With all
the things
we know are true.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.394
And I've been lying in bed
just thinking about this.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.517
For example,
okay, if it was
the brother,

08:50.600 --> 08:52.831
then how do we explain
the phone call from
Lester's to the motel...

08:52.920 --> 08:58.040
Molly! Darn it! Now just...
You can't keep going over...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.834
It's time.
You gotta let it go.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.756
We did our job.
The brother Nygaard
killed the wife.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.638
And he cornered
and shot the Chief.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.995
And Lester was
covering for him

09:09.080 --> 09:10.309
on account of
the brother thing.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.720
Which explains...

09:13.960 --> 09:15.758
We had drinks
to celebrate.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.752
I had a greyhound.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.514
And Knutson had...
What was it with the cherry?

09:20.600 --> 09:22.193
Rob Roy.
Rob Roy. Yeah.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.710
You had a few of them
if I'm not... Mistaken.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.712
What about the Hess case?
What about it?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.790
Still open. Yeah?

09:27.920 --> 09:30.230
Yeah. No. See...

09:30.320 --> 09:32.232
We're checking to see
if the hooker had
a boyfriend,

09:32.320 --> 09:33.310
jealous type...

09:33.400 --> 09:35.631
You know, didn't
like her getting tooled
by every Tom, Dick and Jane.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.955
But otherwise...
Who's working that now?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.110
Terry.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.751
Well, that's good.
Yeah.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.431
Except Terry doesn't know
which end of the mop to use

09:44.560 --> 09:46.358
to wash the floor.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.559
He's not the brightest bulb.
I'll give you that.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.960
But he's soldiering through.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.360
Well, good for him.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.036
Except I'm back now.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.395
No.
Chief, please...

09:58.480 --> 10:01.678
Now, Molly...
Deputy, now
I would give it to you.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.080
I would.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.879
Except we both
know in two days,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.595
I'd be back in this room
with you pointing at
names on that whiteboard,

10:07.680 --> 10:09.194
and me chewing my tie.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.034
Chief, for Pete's sake,
I've got evidence

10:12.120 --> 10:14.157
that puts
Lester Nygaard
in a room

10:14.240 --> 10:16.436
with a known killer
on the day of
the Hess murder,

10:16.520 --> 10:18.591
and then the next night,
Lester called the guy.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.076
He called him at the motel...
Look!

10:21.160 --> 10:24.915
You can't...
That's just how
it is sometimes.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.153
Life.
You go to bed
unsatisfied.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.596
They're calling
the lottery numbers
on the TV

10:31.680 --> 10:33.194
and you get
the first few.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.879
And already
in your mind,

10:34.960 --> 10:36.917
you're buying a jet or
a fjord or whatever.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.559
But it's just
not meant to be.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.677
It's just not
meant to be.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.756
Hey. Look, we're all
real glad to have you back.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.991
Okay? You're a heck
of a police officer.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.671
Tell her about the cake.
Yeah.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.793
The guys are gonna have
a cake for you later.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.556
Try to look surprised.
It's really something.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.879
It's got an assault rifle
on top, made of frosting.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.480
Which I don't know
how they do that.
But...

11:42.520 --> 11:45.797
Heya, Lester.
I like your tie.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.994
Thank you.
I got it online.
Oh, yeah?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.230
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.198
Jacket, too.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.590
I was a bit nervous
about it at first.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.996
Had to send
the jacket back
once actually.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.879
It was...
Too big in the arms.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.236
Well, I think
you look terrific.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.754
Oh.

12:04.840 --> 12:09.119
And...
I was thinking of making
some chili on Saturday night.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.271
If you maybe
wanted to join me?

12:11.360 --> 12:13.079
Where is he?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.595
You son of a bitch.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.911
I'm gonna bust your balls.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.514
You want me to do it, Ma?
Yeah, Ma, want us to?

12:19.600 --> 12:20.590
Shut up!

12:21.840 --> 12:24.196
I am gonna
bust your balls.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.078
Now, Mrs. Hess,
what can I do for...

12:26.160 --> 12:27.674
Don't you
"Mrs. Hess" me.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.991
I was picking your pubes
out of my teeth 12 hours ago.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.275
And then I get this?

12:40.120 --> 12:44.592
That is...
This is highly irregular.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.839
I'll make some calls.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.480
Liar!
Mrs. Hess.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.473
Liar. You knew
the whole time...

12:54.560 --> 12:55.914
No, Mrs...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.151
Gina, this is...

12:58.240 --> 12:59.674
Listen, I'm gonna
make some calls.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.558
Like I said, I was
speaking to the guy

13:01.640 --> 13:03.074
from Mid Claims
just yesterday.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.719
He didn't mention
a single thing.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.271
I let you come
inside of me.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.874
That's really gross.
Yeah, Ma,
don't talk like that.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.111
We don't need to bring
that into the conversation.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.796
You are gonna
get me my money,
you little shit.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.600
$2 million,
you've got until
the end of the day.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.076
Or show him
what we'll do.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.237
Jesus! All right.
All right.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.396
Sorry, loser.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.470
Me, too.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.119
Ow.
Ow.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.718
Yeah!

13:36.800 --> 13:40.760
So are we calm?
Are we calm?

13:43.400 --> 13:47.474
Now here's
what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna make some calls.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.472
Like I said.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.598
Because this is
the first that I've...

13:52.680 --> 13:55.593
But if it's true,
if Sam did miss
some payments,

13:55.680 --> 13:57.831
then, well, they're
within their rights to...

14:00.920 --> 14:03.037
I think we might
have a problem here.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.670
That was...

14:28.760 --> 14:29.796
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.156
No, I'm... That was...

14:34.000 --> 14:35.912
You're amazing.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.995
He'll be right out.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.915
Follow.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.353
Sir? We...

15:51.280 --> 15:54.079
What Agent Pepper
is trying to say,
the Syndicate spree killing,

15:54.160 --> 15:59.758
yes, technically,
we were there outside...
In our car... While it was...

15:59.840 --> 16:01.194
But you have to...

16:01.280 --> 16:03.351
You have to see
it as a positive

16:03.480 --> 16:08.111
because it leaves us,
myself and Agent Budge,

16:08.200 --> 16:09.759
it leaves us...
Poised.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.196
That's the word we like.
Poised to catch this guy.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.160
Because, sir,
first of all,
we got this photo

16:16.240 --> 16:17.754
from an ATM
across the street.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.593
It captures our...
A single individual

16:19.680 --> 16:21.592
who's clearly
armed and about to...

16:21.680 --> 16:23.399
Now, the photo is
not great, but...

16:23.480 --> 16:26.200
I... We were thinking
definitely white male.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.513
Sir?

16:46.320 --> 16:47.959
Listen. Sir...

16:48.040 --> 16:50.316
This is where you work now.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.119
We are highly effective,
highly trained...

16:52.240 --> 16:53.754
I have a commendation.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.516
A commendation?

16:57.880 --> 16:58.916
That's your...

17:05.760 --> 17:06.796
Okay.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.992
Okay. It's...

17:12.480 --> 17:16.997
We're still good.
We're still alive.
He could have...

17:18.800 --> 17:21.634
It could be worse, right?
Much, much worse.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.071
This right here?
Two weeks... Tops.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.558
Just wants to see
us sweat a little...
Feel the...

17:34.960 --> 17:36.872
I mean, it's only fair.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.190
I can see that.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.316
We did...

17:42.880 --> 17:44.792
I mean,
22 people did get killed,

17:44.880 --> 17:47.156
and we're sitting
in the car like a couple of...

17:51.560 --> 17:53.995
Yeah, we're okay.
We're all right.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.196
I've never heard
of a deaf hit man.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.080
Carolina Murphy
had his tongue

19:47.160 --> 19:49.914
cut out by an Indian
back in the '80s.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.238
He worked a little after that,
but never quite the same.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.835
Buzz Mead.
You know Buzz?

19:59.760 --> 20:02.355
He was born
with just a socket.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.192
He used to take
his glass eye out

20:05.280 --> 20:07.272
at parties and
drop it in his drink.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.115
He was a shit shot though.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.592
Now the other fella,
your partner.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.392
He can hear just fine.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.840
We had a kind of chat
before I cut his throat.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.237
You're unemployed now,
by the way

20:38.720 --> 20:40.393
in case you don't
read the papers.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.994
I'll kill you!

20:48.520 --> 20:52.309
I watched a bear once.
Its leg was in a steel trap.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.949
It chewed through
bloody bone to get free.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.720
That was in Alaska.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.672
It died about an hour later,
face down in a stream.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.758
Well, it was on his
own terms, you know?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.070
You got close...

21:35.880 --> 21:37.519
Closer than anybody else.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.117
I don't know if it was you
or your partner, but look...

21:50.200 --> 21:53.637
If you still feel raw about
things when you heal up,
come see me.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.838
Just me and Bill, right?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.991
Slow night...
And the call comes in.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.316
He don't like when
I tell this story.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.757
Heard you
got some flowers.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.076
Yeah, some people do love
to flap their lips.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.674
More than once
is what I heard.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.800
Well, there's a suitor...
Is all I'm prepared to say.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.952
Vern was so bad
at courtship.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.038
One time he gave me
a bouquet of poison ivy.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.191
Picked it himself.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.636
He's up in Duluth...

23:02.520 --> 23:03.636
My gentleman.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.277
Has a daughter.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.874
What's his name?

23:10.080 --> 23:11.355
They call him Sergio.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.279
He's a pirate,
I think.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.431
Very funny, you.
Well.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.399
Yours is the one
with the icing clip.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.473
And, Ida, your frosting
comes from the barrel.
I think.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.400
Good to have everyone
together again,
don't you think?

23:26.480 --> 23:27.914
It's like one big, happy...

23:33.240 --> 23:35.391
Which is good, is all.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.111
I wanted to thank you...
For catching the guy.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.872
Not me.
I was in bed.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.356
Stop. You were
in the hospital
with a bullet.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.590
No.

23:57.120 --> 24:01.512
Bill may have made the arrest,
but we both know
who did the real work.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.358
He's not convicted yet.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.870
I mean,
not all the evidence...

24:14.080 --> 24:15.639
For me,
there are still...

24:18.720 --> 24:22.191
But, yeah, no, I'm...
Glad it's behind us.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.390
Ugh.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.400
Deputy Solverson.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.437
Yeah, hi. It's Gus...

27:48.560 --> 27:49.789
<i>Grimly.</i>

27:49.920 --> 27:51.195
Oh, yeah, hi.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.996
So, what's happening then?

27:58.320 --> 27:59.993
You know, on patrol.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.719
<i>Oh, sure. Yeah.</i>

28:03.400 --> 28:07.076
I helped a fella
who got his privates
stuck to a mailbox.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.310
<i>Oh.</i>

28:09.680 --> 28:11.034
Didn't like his mail?

28:11.120 --> 28:12.270
<i>Something like that.</i>

28:16.560 --> 28:19.120
There's the hearing tomorrow
on the shooting.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.957
Oh, yeah.
That's...

28:23.600 --> 28:24.875
That's tomorrow.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.798
Well, just tell the truth.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.599
<i>Don't you think?</i>

28:30.680 --> 28:32.114
<i>It was a white out,</i>

28:33.600 --> 28:36.195
<i>and you saw a shadow
and you shot at it.</i>

28:36.280 --> 28:37.919
But leave out the part...

28:38.000 --> 28:42.074
Leave out the part where
the person you shot was me.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.640
I am really sorry
about that.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.114
Yeah. I gathered from
the volume of flowers.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.112
Too much?
<i>No.</i>

28:58.560 --> 28:59.630
No, it's nice.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.914
So...
I saw in the paper
this morning,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.595
the logging festival's
coming up

29:09.680 --> 29:11.797
<i>over in your neck of the...</i>

29:11.880 --> 29:13.997
<i>And Greta, she really
likes going to that.</i>

29:14.080 --> 29:15.673
Yeah, me too.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.114
<i>Yeah? Good.</i>

29:17.200 --> 29:19.760
Good. Well, maybe...

29:19.840 --> 29:23.038
I mean,
maybe we'll see you there.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.279
Yeah, a certainty
if we go together.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.633
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

29:34.360 --> 29:35.714
You're right about that.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.919
And when you're right,
you're right.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.519
On Friday,
there's chainsaw carving,
and... All you can eat.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.274
<i>And on Saturday
they roast a
pig underground.</i>

29:49.480 --> 29:51.472
<i>I've never had it,
but it's supposed
to be good.</i>

29:51.600 --> 29:54.513
Oh, I didn't know that
you could do that.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.994
<i>On Sundays,
they do a pie-eating
contest.</i>

29:59.080 --> 30:03.438
Yeah, yeah. No...
I like to just
go for the food.

30:03.520 --> 30:07.036
Greta likes all
the different contests
they have.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.679
Have you ever
seen the guys,

30:08.760 --> 30:12.436
they go all the way up
to the top of the tree...

30:12.600 --> 30:15.593
They've got like bells
and the spikey shoes...

31:02.240 --> 31:04.197
<i>Dad? Come in, Dad.
Over.</i>

31:08.920 --> 31:10.718
Dad here, come back.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.190
<i>What's the deal
with dinner? Over.</i>

31:15.000 --> 31:19.916
Yeah, just finishing up.
Thought we'd do tacos tonight.
Over.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.879
<i>Okay.
Don't forget the red sauce.
Over and out.</i>

32:00.560 --> 32:02.517
I'm home!

32:02.600 --> 32:04.592
You forgot the food,
didn't you?

32:09.120 --> 32:10.520
Mom home?
Yeah.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.000
That your dad?

32:12.080 --> 32:13.878
Did he remember
the red sauce?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.120
Oh, shoot.
I can go back.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.270
No. It's okay.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.113
I think we got some left
from last time.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.680
Go get changed up,
you, and let's eat.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.160
I'm starving.
Yeah.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.039
Just put 'em on the table.
Okay.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.110
Thanks, Greta.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.150
Okay.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.639
Dad wants to know
about the game Sunday.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.120
Watch at his place or...

32:43.200 --> 32:45.999
I thought we
could watch it here.
I could make that pasta thing.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.196
Um.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.760
The one with the peas?

32:50.440 --> 32:52.557
Capers.
You liked it last time.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.758
Oh, don't forget we got that
thing at Ida's on Saturday...
The anniversary.

32:55.840 --> 33:00.312
No. I remember.
It was a week
before I met you.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.914
Anniversary of what?

33:04.600 --> 33:06.159
It's just your...

33:08.720 --> 33:11.110
Molly had a friend of hers
that got killed last year.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.159
So we'll go over there
and pay our respects.

33:14.240 --> 33:17.039
It was...
Vern, right?

33:17.120 --> 33:21.717
Yeah.
He was the Chief before Bill.
Hired me.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.598
Ida, the lady with the baby...
Yeah?

33:23.680 --> 33:25.637
Is his wife.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.191
Which, speaking of,
she asked if we
could bring drinks.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.318
Yeah, I still got some
of that Halloween beer
I made.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.116
I seem to remember
you spitting
that on the floor.

33:38.200 --> 33:42.114
Yeah, I'll go
to the store.
Mmm-hmm.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.793
You okay?
Oh, sure.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.520
Just hard to sit that long.
Legs go to sleep.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.670
<i>FBI.</i>

34:43.760 --> 34:44.955
Hi.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.996
Deputy Solverson again,
Bemidji police.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.753
<i>Yes?</i>

34:48.840 --> 34:50.559
I called a couple times
now about

34:50.639 --> 34:52.233
the Fargo
Syndicate massacre

34:52.360 --> 34:54.636
how I might know
the fella responsible

34:54.719 --> 34:56.518
meaning he's
a suspect in a case.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.239
<i>Yeah, I see your
name on the computer.</i>

34:58.320 --> 35:00.880
<i>Looks like those
suspicions were
investigated and dismissed.</i>

35:00.960 --> 35:04.840
Yeah. They sent
a fella down, but I'm not
sure he really...

35:04.920 --> 35:06.639
<i>Do you have any
new information?</i>

35:06.720 --> 35:09.315
No. No, I just...

35:10.800 --> 35:12.871
A lot of people are dead.
So...

35:12.960 --> 35:15.873
<i>I'll put a note
on the file that
you called.</i>

35:15.960 --> 35:17.030
Okay, but...

35:17.120 --> 35:18.236
<i>I wouldn't expect
a call back though.</i>

35:18.320 --> 35:22.030
<i>We're pretty busy these days,
with the Patriot Act and all.</i>

35:43.640 --> 35:45.120
File room.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.758
A room with files.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.360
Say you took
one of 'em out.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.510
Took it where?

35:55.600 --> 35:56.636
Doesn't matter.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.473
Say you took one
of the files out...

35:59.520 --> 36:01.989
Is it still the file room?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.354
Pizza today, right?

36:06.320 --> 36:08.994
In the cafeteria.
Or is it meatloaf?

36:09.080 --> 36:10.992
No, I'm saying that
you and I both agree

36:11.080 --> 36:13.914
that the file room
minus one file

36:14.880 --> 36:16.758
is still the file room.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.430
Now, say you took
another one out.
And then another.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.195
If the file
room minus one file
is still the file room,

36:26.280 --> 36:28.715
and you keep
subtracting one
at a time,

36:28.800 --> 36:31.269
you could end up
with zero files.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.829
I'm saying, logically
or even negative files.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.872
And it would still be the...
How do you have
negative files?

36:35.960 --> 36:38.680
No. I'm just...
Logically, I'm saying.

36:40.080 --> 36:44.359
Except no one's taking files.
They just bring more.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.033
What about a cemetery,
I mean,

36:46.120 --> 36:48.874
remove one body
from a cemetery,
it's still a cemetery.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.440
But a cemetery
with no bodies,

36:51.640 --> 36:52.630
what's that?

36:52.720 --> 36:53.915
Condos.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.471
Okay, and this is...
Well, these
are my officers, so...

37:29.080 --> 37:30.230
Where is everybody?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.437
Coffee run.
Who's this then?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.079
This is Tahir. He's...

37:35.160 --> 37:36.514
Hey.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.159
Hello, I am Tahir.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.920
I'm Molly,
Deputy Solverson.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.754
Yeah. So remember I told you
me and Sally were
taking in a foster?

37:43.840 --> 37:45.513
Yeah, from Africa.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.274
Yeah, except...
I am from Sudan.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.680
You know Lost Boy?

37:49.840 --> 37:51.194
I sure do.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.115
Welcome to America.
I thought there
was a problem though.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.112
Oh, I'll say!
The kid disappeared.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.120
Disappeared how?

38:00.200 --> 38:02.795
Oh, tell her the story.
Oh. Ha.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.437
This is the craziest thing.
All right?
Go on. You tell her.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.672
In my village,
I tend goats.
You know goats?

38:09.760 --> 38:10.796
Uh-huh.

38:10.880 --> 38:14.112
One day,
men came
and kill everyone.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.034
Mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.719
Geez.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.553
I alone am free.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.390
Three days I walk,
then I meet nice people...

38:25.640 --> 38:26.710
Americans.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.519
These nice people put me
airplane to America.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.309
Land of free.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.994
Home of brave.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.230
Yeah, to us.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.398
He's coming
to live with us.
Go on.

38:40.520 --> 38:44.070
At the airport,
man says,
"Take bag?"

38:44.200 --> 38:49.229
He says, "Get in the car,"
but he doesn't come back.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.880
Guy stole his bag.
Can you believe it?
A refugee.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.071
One day and one night,
I wait at the airport,

38:56.200 --> 38:58.760
but this man,
he does not come back.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.236
I had no money
and no paper.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.911
Nice woman says,
"Tell policeman,"

39:05.040 --> 39:10.274
but I am afraid.
I told her I have
a family waiting...

39:10.360 --> 39:13.592
Nice family...
American family.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.599
But the name is in
the bag and the number.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.953
Nice woman give me coat
and money to take the bus.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.355
So not all bad.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.273
I take the bus
to the city.

39:25.360 --> 39:29.274
But I am very hungry,
four days I no eat.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.434
Then I see a store.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.795
You know...

39:34.480 --> 39:37.359
"July in January"?

39:37.440 --> 39:38.669
Phoenix Farms.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.797
Yes, Phoenix Farms.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.872
Should I tell her this?

39:43.960 --> 39:47.715
So... He shoplifts...

39:47.880 --> 39:48.950
Takes some food.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.156
In fact he does
it every day for,
how long?

39:54.280 --> 39:56.476
Three months.
Three months.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.313
Meanwhile, we're frantic.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.638
You remember?
All those phone calls?
Me raising my voice?

40:01.760 --> 40:04.798
"How could you lose a kid
from Africa in
freaking Minnesota?"

40:05.640 --> 40:08.997
Every day I steal food,
but... I am ashamed.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.831
I don't want to steal.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.317
I want to work,
but what work can I do?

40:16.440 --> 40:18.636
Then a week ago,
Sally and I are

40:18.720 --> 40:20.996
heading into
the city to the ballet.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.759
You went to the ballet?

40:22.840 --> 40:27.153
Sally likes the ballet,
yeah, so...
Go ahead, finish.

40:27.320 --> 40:31.917
I am looking around the store.
Skittles and
peanut butter cups.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.950
Then this man grabs me,
I think I am arrested.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.920
It's me,
is the point
of the story.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.679
All those weeks
looking for the kid...

40:41.800 --> 40:44.952
Writing letters,
making phone calls.
We even put up flyers.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.192
And then,
I stop by a supermarket
in a city I don't live,

40:48.320 --> 40:51.791
all so Sally can have
Chex Mix at the ballet,
and there's the kid.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.360
What are the odds?

40:54.520 --> 40:55.636
I can't even imagine.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.870
I am so worried...

40:57.000 --> 40:59.390
And thinking I am arrested,

40:59.480 --> 41:03.997
but Mr. Bill
is hugging me
and crying.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.031
Well, you know...

41:09.480 --> 41:15.158
And look where I am at.
Who I'm with.
My... American family.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.711
Sally says it's a miracle.
I don't know. It might be.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.759
But don't
question the universe,
that's my motto.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.877
Sometimes
things just work out.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.591
Yeah,
I like to think
that's true.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.476
We found ya, buddy.
We found ya.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.991
<i>- It causes you
to have hallucinations.
- What?</i>

41:42.080 --> 41:43.753
<i>I'll be glad to
explain it to you.</i>

41:43.880 --> 41:44.950
<i>It's a sort of a nightmare</i>

41:45.080 --> 41:47.914
<i>where your
dreams go pell-mell,
helter-skelter and amok.</i>

41:48.040 --> 41:49.110
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

41:50.480 --> 41:52.312
<i>Pell-mell!</i>

41:52.440 --> 41:54.875
<i>Hello. Inspector Clancy
speaking. What?</i>

41:54.960 --> 41:56.474
You need something?

41:56.600 --> 41:59.672
No, I'm good.
Go back to sleep.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.912
<i>Stand back, everybody.
I've got you covered,
stand back.</i>

42:10.480 --> 42:12.995
<i>What's the meaning of this?
Police parading
all over the hotel.</i>

42:13.120 --> 42:14.873
<i>Who sent for you?
Why are you here?</i>

42:14.960 --> 42:16.519
<i>This is Mr. William's suite.</i>

42:16.600 --> 42:18.080
<i>Mr. Williams
has been murdered.</i>

42:18.960 --> 42:20.280
<i>Quiet, everybody.
You'll be quiet.</i>

42:20.400 --> 42:21.436
<i>And that goes for all of you.</i>

42:21.600 --> 42:24.877
<i>Yeah, the chief
is right. Noise, bed-ly-ham,
who can think?</i>

42:24.960 --> 42:27.429
<i>Well, you can't. So shut up.
Where's the body?</i>

42:27.520 --> 42:28.636
<i>In there.</i>

42:34.480 --> 42:36.631
<i>Now what did
you do that for?</i>

42:36.760 --> 42:38.479
<i>Isn't a girl
supposed to scream</i>

42:38.640 --> 42:40.313
<i>when she knows she's
gonna see a dead body?</i>

42:40.440 --> 42:42.352
<i>Quiet. Now come on
in here, all of you.</i>

42:44.880 --> 42:46.155
We're doing good.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.549
I'm up.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.156
Sorry.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.955
I was just saying
we're doing good.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.830
Mmm-hmm.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.957
We got everything we need.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.836
Mmm-hmm.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.320
Well, I'm going
to sleep.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.830
Yeah, me, too.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.273
<i>Oh, it's Jeff,
the night porter.</i>

43:39.360 --> 43:42.353
<i>I left him here
to watch the body.</i>

43:42.480 --> 43:43.880
<i>What happened?</i>

43:48.040 --> 43:49.315
<i>What happened?</i>

43:50.680 --> 43:52.717
<i>I was standing around,
scared stiff,</i>

43:52.800 --> 43:54.792
<i>and all of a sudden,
the lights went out.</i>

43:54.880 --> 43:56.314
<i>Then something
hit me on the head,</i>

43:56.400 --> 43:57.800
<i>and then the lights
went out again.</i>

43:57.880 --> 44:00.952
<i>That's all I know
and that's all I'm gonna wait
around to find out.</i>

44:25.920 --> 44:28.719
<i>Stun Meadows,
everybody! Give it up.</i>

44:30.240 --> 44:31.276
<i>How does he do it?</i>

44:33.440 --> 44:35.079
<i>Check your wallets,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

44:35.160 --> 44:37.720
<i>Make sure he didn't
make those vanish, too.</i>

44:39.880 --> 44:43.078
<i>It's been a big
year for insurance...</i>

44:43.200 --> 44:47.274
<i>A banner year.
Reserve trends are up.</i>

44:47.360 --> 44:48.430
<i>And...</i>

44:49.360 --> 44:52.353
<i>Loss ratios are down
a whopping 17%.</i>

44:58.400 --> 45:00.915
<i>Those are just numbers.</i>

45:01.000 --> 45:05.233
<i>We all know that behind
every insurance policy...</i>

45:05.320 --> 45:08.677
<i>And the reinsurance policy
covering that policy,</i>

45:10.000 --> 45:11.878
<i>there's a salesman.</i>

45:11.960 --> 45:16.955
<i>A man or woman knocking
on doors, making calls,</i>

45:17.280 --> 45:21.354
<i>matching people and businesses
with the right
plan for their needs.</i>

45:22.760 --> 45:27.152
<i>And so without further delay,
I give you...</i>

45:27.240 --> 45:32.315
<i>Insurance Salesman
of the Year 2007...
Lester Nygaard!</i>

45:44.240 --> 45:45.674
Thank you.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.672
Thank you so much.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.035
<i>Thank you so much. That...</i>

45:49.120 --> 45:51.794
<i>Oh, geez,
that's a real honor.</i>

45:51.880 --> 45:52.870
<i>Um...</i>

45:53.840 --> 45:54.830
<i>Now...</i>

45:55.880 --> 45:57.758
<i>I knew I should
have memorized this.</i>

45:59.000 --> 46:00.400
<i>It suddenly doesn't look...</i>

46:01.440 --> 46:04.717
<i>Speak from the heart.
Speak from the heart. Okay.</i>

46:08.080 --> 46:10.834
<i>Those of you that know me,</i>

46:10.920 --> 46:14.118
<i>know it's been a tough year
for me personally.</i>

46:16.360 --> 46:17.635
<i>And that I wouldn't
have gotten through it</i>

46:17.720 --> 46:21.953
<i>without the love and support
of my beautiful wife, Linda.</i>

46:22.040 --> 46:24.032
<i>Let's give her a hand.</i>

46:24.120 --> 46:25.190
<i>I love you.</i>

46:32.440 --> 46:34.796
<i>You can go through
your whole life...</i>

46:37.200 --> 46:38.236
<i>Without a care.</i>

46:40.600 --> 46:43.718
<i>And one day,
it all changes.</i>

46:44.800 --> 46:48.635
<i>People die.
They lose their homes.</i>

46:50.520 --> 46:51.920
<i>They go to prison.</i>

46:53.960 --> 46:58.239
<i>It's calamity.
I know it,
'cause I lived it.</i>

46:59.600 --> 47:02.115
<i>And if this year has
taught me anything...</i>

47:02.200 --> 47:03.998
<i>Believe me,
I've seen it all.</i>

47:05.200 --> 47:07.431
<i>It's that
the worst does happen...</i>

47:09.720 --> 47:13.999
<i>And you need to be insured.
Thank you so much.
It's a great honor.</i>

48:05.280 --> 48:06.873
So proud of ya, Lester.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.156
Aw, thanks, hon.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.913
You tired?

48:12.840 --> 48:14.194
Oh, aren't you?

48:14.320 --> 48:16.073
Well...

48:18.800 --> 48:19.790
Um...

48:20.800 --> 48:24.396
No. Actually,
I'm feeling
pretty keyed up.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.917
I might grab
a nightcap at the bar.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.593
You want me to go...
No, no, no.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.837
You go up to bed.
I'll be up shortly.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.832
Just... It's my night.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.837
I'm sorry,
I'm such a downer.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.240
You're a sunny day.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.199
Go on.
I'll be up presently.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.639
Hi.
Hey. Big night, huh?

49:09.720 --> 49:11.632
Salesman of the Year.
Oh.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.558
Drugs?

49:13.720 --> 49:15.200
Insurance.
Ah.

49:16.040 --> 49:19.033
They really give an award
to the guy who
sells the most drugs?

49:19.120 --> 49:21.077
Pharmaceuticals.
That makes more sense.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.800
So what are you drinking?

49:25.040 --> 49:27.271
Something dangerous.
Let's have a look.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.960
Ah, oh, a blood and sand,
what's that?

49:30.040 --> 49:31.679
Scotch and blood orange.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.830
That's the one.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.036
All right.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.558
And then I sit down
and every... Oh, Miss?

50:03.640 --> 50:07.873
Can we have some more
sparkling water? Thanks.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.119
Anyways... So, I say,

50:11.240 --> 50:14.438
"Hi, I'm Dr. Michaelson.
Nice to meet you
and everything."

50:14.560 --> 50:16.836
And I get ready to
give him the novocaine shot...

50:16.920 --> 50:18.479
Stick it in my own finger.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.877
And it hurt,
but I don't wanna
look stupid, so I...
