01:00.440 --> 01:02.283
I have to run home and change.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.410
Lets just not go.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.521
I'm leaving now.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.326
Five minutes, five more minutes.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.441
Pssst!

01:13.480 --> 01:14.766
They know you'r here.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.450
Don't go back to sleep.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.247
I won't.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.722
Selamat pagi.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.006
Pagi.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.167
You know what shakespear said about punctuality?

03:33.520 --> 03:37.241
Better three hours too early, then one minute too late.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.965
My hand was on the door on time.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.082
So here we are, at the end of it all

04:00.360 --> 04:03.409
I've done what I can for you, now you have to go out and think on your own

04:03.720 --> 04:05.324
time to fly or die.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.522
Still defending Aristóteles, Mr. Zimit.

04:07.880 --> 04:12.568
Up or down.0 or 1. True or false. Fly or die.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.921
You'r a slave to binary logic, you know that?

04:15.120 --> 04:16.690
Logic, being?

04:16.800 --> 04:17.767
The science of reason.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.086
Or more precisely?

04:19.200 --> 04:20.565
The power of the mind to form judgment

04:20.680 --> 04:22.569
based on strict principles of validity.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.841
Logic...

04:25.440 --> 04:29.206
Remains after 10,000 years of the human experience,

04:29.840 --> 04:31.365
the best way to get through the day.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.284
Though it still doesn't do much for you at night.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.565
Oh, right. I've read a great line in bed last night

04:36.720 --> 04:37.881
I was going to mention this.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.682
Philosophy is to real life, as masturbation is to sex.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.521
At least you're reading.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.085
That brings up an interesting point though

04:47.200 --> 04:50.283
wether philosophy makes any difference to help people actually live.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.723
I mean, Mr. Zimit would you say that most people

04:52.840 --> 04:54.842
who never study philosophy do ok in life?

04:55.600 --> 04:58.126
I couln't give a monkey's, wether most people do ok in life.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.087
I mean according to who's vapid creed, is doing ok?

05:01.440 --> 05:04.489
"The definition of a meaningfull existance?"

05:04.600 --> 05:06.841
If we really want to talk about most people..

05:07.720 --> 05:10.883
Most people are waddling through their days

05:11.520 --> 05:13.648
stuffing cheese puffs down their gullets,

05:13.760 --> 05:15.046
Most people are so mush brains

05:15.160 --> 05:17.561
they have no hope of solving of the intricate problems

05:17.680 --> 05:19.762
they come up against as adult human beings

05:19.920 --> 05:22.526
most people by the age of 40 have turn into blubbering nutters

05:24.000 --> 05:25.411
at least on the inside.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.603
Fortunatly, you're not "Most people".

05:31.440 --> 05:32.362
So for you, theres a chance to

05:32.480 --> 05:34.084
clear apart through the muck of the world

05:34.200 --> 05:37.204
And see ahead to the deep truth of things.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.484
Which is why we spent the last year

05:40.080 --> 05:43.084
strengthening your mind with the same tools

05:43.200 --> 05:45.771
used by some of the best brains in history.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.920
Descartes, Newton, Wittgenstein, to explore in the imagination

05:52.280 --> 05:55.204
what they were constraint from exploring in the physical world.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.242
Do we feel like recaping some of our favorite thought experiments?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.246
The infinite monkey theorem.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.327
The infinite monkey theorem...

06:03.440 --> 06:06.808
the classic way to wrap your head around the concept of "infinity".

06:06.960 --> 06:10.362
Which is so endless that if you put a monkey at a typewriter

06:10.680 --> 06:12.045
and let him bang away at it forever,

06:12.160 --> 06:17.644
he'll eventually, almost surely. Completly randomly type out the entire play of hamlet, word for word.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.210
I mean, the odds are nanoscale but he's gonna hit all the rights keys on a row

06:21.320 --> 06:24.324
on any given day, but over the strech of eternity

06:24.680 --> 06:26.091
across time, without any limit

06:26.200 --> 06:27.440
every event has some

06:27.560 --> 06:30.450
actual mathematical probabilty of really happening.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.762
Who else?

06:33.880 --> 06:35.006
I like the trolley problem.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.201
An out of control trolley car is speeding towards 5 people

06:38.320 --> 06:39.321
tied to a track

06:39.520 --> 06:41.045
but, you can pull a lever

06:41.760 --> 06:43.569
and make the trolley swerve into another track

06:45.360 --> 06:47.089
where only 1 person is going to get run down.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.081
Should you do it?

06:54.280 --> 06:56.203
If your being utilitarian about it, you can argue

06:56.320 --> 06:59.051
that you did the right thing letting 1 person die to save 5.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.571
But what if the situation was slightly different?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.647
This time there's no lever to make the trolley swerve

07:03.800 --> 07:06.690
but theres an obese man standing next to the track

07:06.800 --> 07:08.643
and you calculate that he wheights just enough

07:08.760 --> 07:09.761
to derail the trolley.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.241
Do you push him in front of it?

07:17.560 --> 07:18.800
Absolutly not!

07:19.080 --> 07:20.844
How's it less acceptable than the first version?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.248
You'r still sacrificing 1 person to save 5.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.407
They're both wrong.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.408
Don't be fool by the arithmetic

07:29.360 --> 07:31.488
it's murder, eithir way.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.842
Anyone else?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.450
The ignorant bliss paradox.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.411
You're hanging off the highest tower in Yakarta

07:39.920 --> 07:41.809
it's a thousand foot drop to your death

07:41.920 --> 07:43.922
so you call your three best friends for help

07:46.000 --> 07:47.206
they rush out to save you

07:47.920 --> 07:51.891
but they're afraid if they try to pull you up, they might be yanked over themselves

07:52.000 --> 07:53.001
so they step back.

07:57.160 --> 08:02.303
You fall...

08:02.403 --> 08:03.703
and live.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.571
But do you wish you never tested your friends, in the first place?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.325
Since now you know you can't count on them

08:08.440 --> 08:10.169
when it's a matter of life or death.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.284
Would it be better if you stayed ignorant of what their truly good for

08:13.400 --> 08:15.004
and gone on being friend forever?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.247
I'd wanna know the truth

08:16.960 --> 08:20.043
cut your loses, and walk on. you'll find other friends.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.049
You'll fall off other towers.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.526
The good news is:

08:24.320 --> 08:26.129
although we're about to part ways.

08:27.160 --> 08:32.006
Not one of you leaves here, lacking the credentials to thrive in the world

08:33.080 --> 08:36.482
your all well equipped, to push on to university

08:37.280 --> 08:40.124
and become happy, energetic members

08:40.240 --> 08:43.801
of a post industrial twenty-first century society.

08:48.280 --> 08:53.241
On the other hand. what if that society ceases to exist?

08:54.400 --> 08:57.210
What if your credentials don't mean what you expected?

08:57.520 --> 09:01.081
And your expectations mean nothing at all?

09:01.960 --> 09:03.610
I know it's hard to concieve of everything

09:03.720 --> 09:07.122
you'ved based your plans on, being wiped away at a single stroke

09:07.520 --> 09:10.649
but I'ts happened before and it can happen again

09:15.600 --> 09:17.011
so let's say things do change

09:18.440 --> 09:21.842
I propose one last good ancan experiment

09:22.480 --> 09:25.882
a final thought experiment, for our final session together.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.762
Something on a grand scale, something juicy.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.888
Let's invision a global cataclysm

09:33.440 --> 09:35.727
in the event of which, how do you survive?

09:35.840 --> 09:39.208
Uh, the last day of the year is you know

09:39.320 --> 09:41.607
traditionally sort of a chill experience for seniors

09:42.120 --> 09:44.009
this is starting to feel, not so chill.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.761
Uh, the last day of the year is traditionally, you now

09:47.880 --> 09:50.724
still a day which I can fail seniors.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.765
Or at least knock them down a letter grade

09:52.880 --> 09:53.847
for refusing to participate.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.724
That's what the academic handbook says.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.127
But what kind of cataclysm are we talking about?

09:58.560 --> 10:01.723
Gamma ray burst, Pandemic, Erupting super volcano,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.764
a sudden shift in the earth axis rotation, gray goo?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.120
Hang on chips, we'll get there.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.211
But is it biological? geological? Thermal nuclear? Meteorological?

10:10.640 --> 10:14.087
Let's go old school, say Atomic.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.527
Ready? set.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.361
Think...

10:45.640 --> 10:47.847
Definetly radiological and heading this way.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.684
Sorry, what are we doing in Prambanan?

10:49.800 --> 10:50.801
Field trip.

10:50.960 --> 10:56.126
Listen up everyone. We're going to have to take shelter here in this reinforced bunker.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.001
You see the problem.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.005
We're a group of 21 but the bunker is only built for 10.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.408
So we'll share a beds and ration supplies.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.363
Can't be done. Let me show you why.

12:02.560 --> 12:07.009
You can't share oxygen, every cubic centimeter of breathable air in here

12:07.160 --> 12:10.642
once the outer door is seal, comes from these compressed tanks

12:11.040 --> 12:11.927
this place has been enginered

12:12.080 --> 12:14.048
to support 10 people for 1 year

12:14.280 --> 12:17.011
even 1 person more means, death by hypoxia.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.847
If you try to cram anyone else in, you'll asphyxiate.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.765
The temperature of an impact point is ten million degrees

13:03.000 --> 13:05.480
we have maybe an hour before the wind starts dropping fallout.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.728
This is a radiological event thats global in scope

13:08.000 --> 13:10.480
to live through it, we'll have to spend a full year inside this bunker

13:10.640 --> 13:13.564
which is equipped with a generator and fuel supply to keep it running that long

13:14.040 --> 13:15.644
which means you have to decide

13:15.760 --> 13:18.491
whos valuable enough to expend limited resources on.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.771
I stipulate the existance of 1,000 bunkers around the world

13:21.880 --> 13:25.566
times 10 occupants per bunker, that's a gene pool of 10,000 people

13:25.680 --> 13:27.284
to reboot the human race with.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.485
I'm sorry, are you saying we are suppose to choose who goes in the bunker and

13:32.200 --> 13:36.250
who stays out and dies? becouse if that's the experiment I'm not doing it.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.409
Well, you have to.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.962
I won't. It's repulsive.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.490
It's the sort of pseudo-science

13:43.600 --> 13:47.525
a gang of nazis would have dreamt up in a big garden, circa 1939.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.045
This isn't a eugenics experiment

13:49.680 --> 13:51.125
the goal isn't to improve the human race

13:51.240 --> 13:52.844
the goal is to save the human race.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.729
Which means, a commitment to reason no matter how much it hurts.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.167
I decline.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.760
Then we'll be 20 rather than 21 to whittle down to 10.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.008
When the hot particles of nuclear fallout

14:03.120 --> 14:08.684
burn through your skin and your organs start shutting down through radiation poisoning, ..

14:09.920 --> 14:11.331
Try not to scream.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.003
Well, I suppose I'm in.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.042
I'm sorry but this one is not for me, so...

14:31.200 --> 14:34.761
the thing about an A+, as far as semester grades go

14:35.600 --> 14:39.446
it's more than rare, it's practically mythological.

14:40.200 --> 14:45.969
And an A+ in philosophy, there's never been one in the history of this department.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.007
So I have to ask, How does it feel knowing

14:50.120 --> 14:54.330
you could've been the first, if only you hadn't walked out the door?

14:55.360 --> 14:58.284
Bribery is not my very favorite form of negotiation.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.567
Then what about sympathy?

15:00.080 --> 15:03.050
Let's say if you leave someone else pays.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.970
The difference between an A+ and an A

15:05.080 --> 15:09.563
won't change your life, but for example, james?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.048
A grade that drops form a B-to a c+

15:12.160 --> 15:15.846
that might actually disturb the good people at Cornell admission's office.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.846
You'll risk a faculty review, to keep me here?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.247
I'm a rationalist.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.201
I know I need the best student in the room, to stay in the room

15:26.440 --> 15:28.010
if I want a thought expirement

15:28.120 --> 15:29.770
to yield it's sharpest result.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.331
This is one rude "goodbye", you could've just bought us pastries.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.011
I don't have a problem with an atomic holocaust.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.042
That's the spirit.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.128
We are pioneers of the mind in this classroom

15:43.240 --> 15:45.083
scholars and philosphers

15:45.440 --> 15:47.408
so, this is how it's going to work

15:48.880 --> 15:51.770
you'll each choose at random a card from inside this box

15:51.920 --> 15:53.251
on each card there is a profession

15:53.360 --> 15:56.091
based on that profession, your colleagues are going to make decisions

15:56.200 --> 15:58.407
concerning your bunker worthiness.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.360
James was last one into the room

16:00.520 --> 16:02.887
I designate you, first one into the experiment

16:03.320 --> 16:05.402
we'll make a punctual man out of you, one way or the other.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.050
Isn't punctuality the virtue of the lonely?

17:18.040 --> 17:21.123
So, who are we? James?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.529
I am an organic farmer.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.890
I'm a structural engineer.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.002
Real state agent.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.166
I'm a carpenter.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.884
I'm an opera singer.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.405
I'm a hedgefront manager.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.121
I'm a harpist.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.480
I'm an Austronaut.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.691
I'm a Phd in chemistry.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.767
I'm an electrician.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.564
I'm a wine auctianeer.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.091
I'm an orthopetic surgeon.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.361
I'm a house keeper.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.686
I'm a fashion designer.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.166
I'm a gelato maker.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.767
I'm a zoo-ologist.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.361
I'm a psycho therapist,

17:51.840 --> 17:52.887
I'm a soldier.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.764
I'm a United States senator.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.081
I'm a published poet.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.649
You would have never have voted him into the bunker

18:23.000 --> 18:24.809
what does a poet bring to the table in the world

18:24.920 --> 18:27.491
we are facing, his skillset was the definition of useless.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.329
That doesn't mean you had to kill him.

18:29.440 --> 18:33.206
Was it any crueler than letting an atomic cloud peel his skin off?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.044
Do you not see the weather?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.807
And do you really imagine he was just going to sit on a rock

18:40.920 --> 18:41.921
and wait to be scorched?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.291
If you hadn't voted in a slot

18:45.120 --> 18:46.531
he would have killed you to get in.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.087
How can you know that?

18:48.200 --> 18:50.328
Your still not locking on the conditions of the excercise

18:50.560 --> 18:54.087
you have a brutally short window to calculate, who deserves a slot on your bunker.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.806
Your one tool: logic.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.887
The variables?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.401
Your skill sets as indicated on the cards you chosen.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.491
Other than that, you are in the thought experiment as you are in real life.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.242
James, name your best characteristic.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.526
I'm a pacifist.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.369
So he is a pacifist in our experiment

19:12.520 --> 19:13.442
it was close call

19:13.560 --> 19:15.289
between two people of different gender

19:15.400 --> 19:17.528
preference always goes to the girl.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.408
Becouse child bearing becomes job ?1 after the apocalypse.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.688
Who are you in this experiment?

19:23.800 --> 19:28.601
I am the wild card. a person whose skillset you don't know

19:28.720 --> 19:31.326
so you have to assest wether it's worth keeping me around

19:31.720 --> 19:34.963
you might learn something from me, that you need to survive.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.326
Sounds inconsistent.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.881
Well then for now just think of me as the chap who enforces the rules.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.686
I'm an orthopedic surgeon. which is ever better than being a regular doctor,

19:42.800 --> 19:45.041
'couse I specialize in fixing broken bones

19:45.200 --> 19:46.690
which I expect we'll have many

19:46.920 --> 19:50.811
I provide excellent value, so it's hard to invision not voting me in.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.361
All agreed?

20:02.520 --> 20:04.761
So, I'm a harpist.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.768
It's rather worse than that. your a harpist without a harp.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.406
Is that really the measure of a man?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.327
Wether or not he has his harp with him, post-cataclysm.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.970
But even if you had a harp,

20:15.280 --> 20:18.921
as far as the survival of the species goes, harp playing is not crucial

20:19.560 --> 20:22.006
so who votes to give Russell a slot?

20:34.360 --> 20:35.441
Fuck it.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.367
Zoo-ology just ins't a skillset we absolutly need

20:41.480 --> 20:42.561
we all know about animals.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.490
A carpenter is basic, how can we not have a carpenter?

20:45.600 --> 20:47.409
If we are going to repair broken equipment

20:47.640 --> 20:48.971
we obviously need an electrician.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.367
I don't really know what a wine auctioneer even does.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.285
A fashion designer? Beatrice, I wish I could say yes,

20:54.400 --> 20:57.131
but how would what you know about clothes help us survive?

20:57.240 --> 21:01.848
Nelson, you're such a good guy but your a housekeeper, it's low value.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.167
Omosede is a senator. She knows the law

21:04.320 --> 21:06.607
She knows how to negotiate, she knows how to lead.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.370
James is an organic farmer

21:08.480 --> 21:10.926
if we cant grow food, we can't live.

21:11.080 --> 21:15.290
A gelatto maker is lovely, truly lovely, but that's it.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.765
A real state agent, in a world

21:16.920 --> 21:18.809
with no more houses to buy or sell?

21:18.960 --> 21:20.928
Look I always wanted to be an austrounaut but I

21:21.040 --> 21:22.804
don't think we'll be sending ships into space any time soon.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.891
Jack has a phd in chemistry, that's vital in a thousand different ways.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.126
We'll need a mental health proffesional

21:28.240 --> 21:30.971
in a world where we are all going to be traumatize for the rest of our lifes.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.206
A hedge front manager

21:32.800 --> 21:34.529
it will be like giving a slot to a vampire.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.086
A structural engineer means we can rebuild

21:37.200 --> 21:39.168
houses, bridges, dams..

21:39.280 --> 21:42.409
What does a soldier contribute except ways to kill people?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.085
Ways to keep the peace, of course.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.089
An opera singer is essential

21:46.920 --> 21:50.606
for entertaiment, for relaxation, for inspiration.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.285
What does Mr. Zimit bring?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.648
The answer is, we don't know.

21:55.160 --> 21:59.245
He self identifies as the wild card, it's too big a risk.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.530
I think we can survive without an opera singer, at best it's a luxery

22:03.920 --> 22:07.163
Mr. Zimit is bringing some kind of secret utility, that can really matter.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.847
I would rather have the chance to win big than win small.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.964
All in favor of giving Mr. Zimit the last slot.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.326
We're going to be cooped up for a whole year, let's take 5 minutes and be alone.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.685
I found these in a stream, should I bring them?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.165
Thanks for staying to save me.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.043
What makes you think I stayed for you?

23:45.360 --> 23:48.011
Well I think you stayed to save me from getting a "C"

23:52.920 --> 23:54.081
You can't live without me.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.163
They din't want to face the agony of death by radiation

24:39.240 --> 24:40.321
they asked me to help.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.803
I don't want him in the bunker with us.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.000
Listen, I'm going to try some hydroponic gardening

25:03.560 --> 25:04.766
while we're locked in for the year.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.604
Maybe get some fresh vitamins in our own system

25:07.720 --> 25:09.006
instead of just the freeze dried stuff.

25:09.120 --> 25:13.330
So, if everybody could take a quick look around

25:13.440 --> 25:14.680
and bring in whatever plants or herbs you find

25:14.800 --> 25:15.801
that'd be a big help.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.521
Better three hours too early, than one minute too late.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.331
Is everybody ok?

26:39.360 --> 26:40.566
We never saw the bathroom.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.681
There's no condoms.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.765
Sex isn't for fun anymore.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.086
Come look at this.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.446
It's a retreat space to take the edge of cabin fever

27:03.040 --> 27:06.681
artiificial garden, phototherapy

27:08.040 --> 27:11.123
day bed, all to help aliviate deppression.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.242
I could live through a year in a bunker

28:00.040 --> 28:05.171
I could find the fields, I could rebuild the world

28:07.960 --> 28:13.205
I can do anything. As long as your with me.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.241
It's a lie, there is no exit code.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.641
Let's find out. No, no, no!

29:44.800 --> 29:47.121
You'll flood us with rediation if it opens.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.890
What if we do need a code to get out?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.367
Well, we're going have to live through the year not knowing the answer to that.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.927
Can I point out, that isntead of writing down

29:55.040 --> 29:56.530
he was the only one who had the code

29:57.120 --> 29:58.645
he could've just written down the code.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.448
- Meaning?
- He was only taunting us.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.644
He knew it'd be a riddle gnawing at our brains for 12 months

30:07.200 --> 30:08.361
I'm not sure about that.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.524
Why would a bunker need a code to get out?

30:10.960 --> 30:12.166
Security precaution

30:12.400 --> 30:15.324
to prevent someone opening the door too early, without realizing it would kill us.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.410
He woudln't bury us in here

30:17.600 --> 30:18.601
maybe he would.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.168
We did do the dirty on him and lock him out.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.000
364 days till we know whos right.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.047
It wasn't what you'ed call a heavenly year.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.003
Life in a bunker on the wrong side of an atomic apocalypse

32:52.720 --> 32:55.371
is no joy, under the best of circumstances.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.601
But it's far worse.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.087
When your there, brooding over the calendar

33:00.600 --> 33:05.401
wondering if the end of your first agony, will be the beginning of your next.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.843
Without the exit code, there was no getting out

33:54.080 --> 33:56.970
every idea the mind could spit up was tried.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.447
Beginning with the bunker's small armory.

34:21.480 --> 34:27.089
It was all in vain. the emotional instead of rational calculus

34:27.199 --> 34:30.043
used to deny the one person a slot in the bunker

34:30.480 --> 34:31.686
who as it turns out

34:32.199 --> 34:38.003
could have got everyone safely out again, was now producing it's inescaple result.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.687
Eventually the last container of food

35:00.880 --> 35:04.407
from the last storage bin, was cooked and served.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.369
No proper meals followed,

35:14.720 --> 35:19.487
only scraps of nourishment from any source available.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.289
Then came an unexpected death

35:36.640 --> 35:37.971
a brain aneurysm.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.890
Not a medical examiner was present to say so

35:42.680 --> 35:45.206
brought on by acute mental anguish

36:12.680 --> 36:15.729
Those who couln't bear what they done to stay alive

36:15.840 --> 36:21.529
or what horrors they had to look forward to, until they die, asked for help.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.766
And then, finally, the oxygen supply

36:26.880 --> 36:29.611
which had lasted several weeks longer than a year

36:29.680 --> 36:35.403
becouse there had been only 9 people in the bunker, instead of 10, dribbled to a halt

36:38.600 --> 36:42.321
hyphoxia followed and then it was all done.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.201
Charming.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.607
I was eaten.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.523
I'm a little dubious about only you knowing the exit code

37:04.640 --> 37:06.051
it's quite coincidental.

37:06.200 --> 37:11.240
Einstein said "coincidence it's just God's way of staying anonymous."

37:11.920 --> 37:13.365
So God gave you the code?

37:13.480 --> 37:18.407
I stipulated I was the wild card, wich you get in any random sampling.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.126
Your job was to include or exclude me based

37:21.240 --> 37:24.210
on what you din't know about me, you chose wrong.

37:25.720 --> 37:31.727
Becouse what you din't know about me, is I'm a bunker builder

37:33.320 --> 37:34.970
with the indonisian defense department

37:35.080 --> 37:38.084
as a matter of fact, I built the bunker you just died in.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.200
So it's no surprise I knew the exit code, since I keyed it into the system myself.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.642
Don't worry about it you'll do better in the next iteration.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.206
Next iteration?

38:06.880 --> 38:07.961
Mont Bromo.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.245
New iteration: new location.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.845
But we still have a bunker and we still have an apocalypse.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.400
Everything is in one piece inside.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.090
So how would it be any different this time?

38:52.200 --> 38:54.965
Theres always another angle to any experiment

38:55.080 --> 38:56.286
and you saw going in

38:56.520 --> 38:59.649
no one in the world is define only by his or her skillset

38:59.760 --> 39:01.444
theres always more to the story

39:01.920 --> 39:03.763
check the inside of your card

39:04.040 --> 39:05.804
hold on, one at a time.

39:05.960 --> 39:10.921
I'm an organic farmer. who is gay.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.567
Thats not going to win votes.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.729
- Why not?
- Becouse we're stepping things up

39:16.560 --> 39:18.722
every bunker around the world is now required to get

39:18.840 --> 39:20.205
at least one pregnancy in the works

39:20.320 --> 39:24.723
Preferably, produce a healthy baby during the course of the year's confiment.

39:25.360 --> 39:29.046
That still doesn't answer my question. I'm a farmer, I'm gay.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.448
No big deal, I still know what I know about farming

39:32.560 --> 39:35.484
and I can still sleep with a girl to get her pregnant, if that's what your talking about.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.370
I still have the right equipment so, whoever wants to vote for me?

39:46.600 --> 39:52.209
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, who on a trip to Uganda last week

39:52.320 --> 39:55.005
"foot doctors without borders" was exposed to the Ebola virus

39:55.880 --> 39:59.202
may or may not be on the verge of a full blown ebola hemorrhagic fever.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.569
That's a puzzler, do you risk a slot on a doctor

40:06.240 --> 40:09.961
could save your life, if she doesn't drop dead next week.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.569
Or who could just as easily infect you with the virus

40:15.360 --> 40:16.850
that will exterminate the whole bunker.

40:16.960 --> 40:20.009
I highly doubt I contracted the disease, I'm sure I'll be fine

40:21.800 --> 40:23.882
all in favor of going through the apocalypse with healthcare?

40:47.480 --> 40:49.562
I don't think thats logical decision macking.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.807
I think it's irrational surrender to fear mongering.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.208
I won't be leaving here with warm memories of you, becouse of this.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.328
I don't care, how warm your memories of me are

41:06.720 --> 41:10.930
I only care wether I streched your brain to their largest possible size.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.008
Your a mean bean Mr. Zimit.

41:13.520 --> 41:17.320
And pardon me for saying but somedays your logic reeks of bullshit.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.361
Next.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.645
I'm a hedge front manager

41:30.080 --> 41:32.481
who becouse of a phobia about armageddon

41:32.600 --> 41:37.527
always travels with 5 million dollars worth of diamonds, zaphiries, gold and platnium in hand

41:40.480 --> 41:43.245
and unlike paper money it holds its value during war or famine

41:43.360 --> 41:44.885
on a cataclysm like this.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.169
Plus shes a girl. She has girl parts.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.887
Chips, you're up.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.527
I'm a carpenter

42:01.240 --> 42:04.528
Um, Sterile... cool.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.688
Atomic war is going to flatten everything, right?

42:08.120 --> 42:12.409
So, we're going to need to build new houses, lawns and sheds with our bare hands

42:12.520 --> 42:14.443
Everything is going to be made out of wood for a century

42:14.560 --> 42:15.686
that takes expertise

42:17.280 --> 42:18.441
I'm voting for Chips.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.641
Thanks, James.

42:24.880 --> 42:30.410
I am a structural engineer, who is also an electrical engineer.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.681
Hard to argue with that

42:38.920 --> 42:40.251
I'm an electrician

42:41.760 --> 42:45.606
Who has fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva

42:46.040 --> 42:49.840
it's a very rare disease of the connective tissue. a mutation.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.041
Every time I fall down or bump into something

42:54.160 --> 42:56.891
wherever I hurt myself turns to bone on the inside

42:58.120 --> 42:59.451
in the end I'll ossifice all over

43:01.160 --> 43:04.164
I'll be a statue under my skin. I'll only be able to move my lips.

43:05.680 --> 43:10.004
Andy, I'm sorry mate, but that's not so good.

43:11.280 --> 43:15.126
We let you in the first time so you could help get the electrical grid working but

43:16.760 --> 43:18.091
if your all turn to bone

43:18.800 --> 43:21.041
You'r not going to be able to climb the transmission towers

43:21.440 --> 43:23.044
or even walk.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.808
I could be really carefull

43:24.920 --> 43:27.048
and try not to bump into things for a few years.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.081
Sounds like a losing battle.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.570
Also, your no treat for the gene pool.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.811
Petra's extra degree in electrical engineering

43:42.440 --> 43:45.125
means your skillset as an electrician won't be much missed.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.924
What's going on? we already had our blast.

43:50.760 --> 43:51.921
This is worse than before

43:53.800 --> 43:55.245
We are in the middle of an atomic free for fall

43:55.400 --> 43:59.200
we better wrap this up. Poppy.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.287
I'm a psychotherapist, though its true

44:08.400 --> 44:10.164
I had a histerectomy at the age of 12

44:10.800 --> 44:12.564
due to pediatric overian cancer.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.890
So you can't have kids?

44:20.400 --> 44:23.563
I'm a zoo-ologist and I blog at night for PETA.

44:24.840 --> 44:28.970
Well there are no more zoos and no more computers...

44:29.760 --> 44:31.091
there are still animals

44:31.240 --> 44:34.722
Vivian, we are at the dividing line between survival and anihalation

44:36.160 --> 44:38.447
What do you have to offer after the bombs stop falling?

44:39.800 --> 44:42.531
I'm a Phd in chemistry, who won the genetic lotto

44:42.880 --> 44:45.804
so I won't get, heart disease, lung disease

44:45.920 --> 44:47.604
Joint disease or brain disease.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.482
Barring a knife to the neck or stepping into quick sand

44:50.600 --> 44:54.764
I will live to the age of 103 without any serious physical ailment or impediment.

45:02.320 --> 45:05.290
I'm a real state agent but also a midwife

45:05.520 --> 45:06.646
a male midwife?

45:07.200 --> 45:10.204
Yeah, a male midwife, sexist.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.170
We lost our doctor, we need someone who can deliver babies

45:14.480 --> 45:16.323
how can we not vote for midwife?

45:16.720 --> 45:18.006
I'm a gelato maker. that's it.

45:19.720 --> 45:23.406
Theres nothing on the inside of my card.

45:23.720 --> 45:24.767
All agaisnt.

45:32.800 --> 45:36.282
I'm an opera singer, so I speak seven langueges

45:36.400 --> 45:38.926
we'll need to be able to communicate with survivers

45:39.040 --> 45:40.690
from other bunkers around the world.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.886
There's something else.

45:47.400 --> 45:51.564
But, why does the inside of my card say two things?

45:51.720 --> 45:52.881
And mine said none?

45:53.040 --> 45:56.123
Must be a typo, keep going.

45:57.440 --> 46:00.683
In three years I'll develop throat cancer

46:01.760 --> 46:03.125
and if theres no hospital

46:04.040 --> 46:07.931
and no doctor to take out the tumor, I'll lose my voice

46:09.560 --> 46:13.246
I won't be able to sing or speak

46:15.080 --> 46:17.651
even though the cancer will stop just short of killing me.

46:25.760 --> 46:30.288
I'm a wine auctioneer. I have an I. Q of 200.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.646
I'm voting for Mitzie.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.006
Your voting for everyone

46:33.160 --> 46:34.605
shes litterally a genius.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.524
I'ts less Impressive than it sounds

46:37.240 --> 46:39.208
a wine auctioneer who test well is...

46:40.080 --> 46:45.405
not a must have for saving civilization, I'm sorry Mitz.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.601
I'm a fashion designer

46:46.720 --> 46:50.008
who created a hit line of womens wear out of bamboo cashmier.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.926
So I'm a left brain, right brain success story.

46:53.080 --> 46:56.687
Insignificant. all agaisnt?

46:58.520 --> 47:02.650
I'm a harpist, with an autism spectrum disorder.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.964
I'm a United States senator

47:06.760 --> 47:09.809
who would have become the best female cheif justice of the supreme court

47:10.880 --> 47:13.486
and the most effective american jurist in the generation.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.808
I'm a soldier with a document eidetic memory

47:17.320 --> 47:20.608
the army has me on tape reciting the first 92 thousand decimal places of Pi.

47:20.720 --> 47:24.042
I'm a housekeeper, who is such a good and kind person

47:24.160 --> 47:25.321
that the angels will bow their heads

47:25.440 --> 47:28.011
as I walk through the gates of heaven, if heaven exist.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.768
And if not, I'm just a nice guy who clean rooms

47:32.280 --> 47:33.566
Are we seriously considering this?

47:34.000 --> 47:35.161
We need more boys.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.722
He is a house keeper.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.366
No nation suceeds without the strong working class

47:40.160 --> 47:43.084
he's strong, I say we let in some strenght.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.087
I'm a published poet who...

48:24.080 --> 48:25.411
I'm afraid his slot is for me.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.970
Why would we give it to you now?

48:28.440 --> 48:30.010
We never got the exit code from him

48:30.560 --> 48:31.971
we still need what he knows.

48:37.160 --> 48:41.210
Give me the keys to the truck, now, now!

48:42.720 --> 48:45.963
I intent to outrun these blasts, I have room for passagers is up to you!

49:33.680 --> 49:34.727
Move! move! move!

51:12.440 --> 51:15.444
Petra, Petra, pleaser. Petra, please stop!

51:20.520 --> 51:21.681
Petra, pleaser!

51:22.800 --> 51:23.801
What happened?

51:29.240 --> 51:31.527
I walked in on James and Jack.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.961
James and Jack?

51:35.880 --> 51:37.644
This is how I am now, you know that.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.240
But with Jack?

51:39.560 --> 51:41.562
Yeah the rules are, except for what's written on the cards we are

51:41.680 --> 51:44.763
In the thought experiment what we are in real life

51:47.760 --> 51:48.761
I din't know

51:50.640 --> 51:53.041
my boyfriend was over from Cambridge in christmas, you met him.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.531
I thought that was your cousin

51:56.480 --> 51:57.561
My cousin?

51:59.880 --> 52:02.087
I misunderstood for some reason, I apologize.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.761
You ok?

52:36.960 --> 52:39.088
At least James can still be your baby daddy.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.731
We can still procreate with him.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.524
I'm not sure about that.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.761
I'm just not sure I feel right about sleeping with a girl

52:50.760 --> 52:52.000
for me, it'd be unatural.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.847
And for the survival of the speicies you couln't fake it?

52:56.120 --> 52:57.201
Which you said you would.

52:57.640 --> 52:58.687
Should I have to?

53:00.800 --> 53:04.486
I mean do we really understand what the bigguer picture is?

53:06.600 --> 53:09.331
Maybe by not procreating I'm helping the species to survive

53:09.440 --> 53:14.367
or even, evolve in some complicated way we can't understand.

53:14.480 --> 53:18.326
Evolve, by not procreating?

53:21.920 --> 53:25.083
Maybe this a good time to go over how we are going to pair up

53:27.720 --> 53:30.246
we need to get a pregnancy going as fast as we can

53:31.320 --> 53:34.927
and the arithmatic on six males and four females, doesn't leave many options.

53:36.240 --> 53:39.608
First of all, Bonnie and Plum are both having their periods, so they're out for now.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.644
How did you know I'm having my period?

53:42.080 --> 53:44.367
I'm a midwife. I can tell.

53:46.760 --> 53:49.570
And I think Omosede has her eye on Nelson,

53:51.200 --> 53:52.201
so they're paired up.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.651
Does that sound ok to you?

53:59.280 --> 54:00.327
Lovely.

54:01.680 --> 54:04.524
Which leaves Petra, who's ovulating

54:07.240 --> 54:09.242
and for sperm donation is Mr. Zimit.

54:11.840 --> 54:12.887
What?

54:13.520 --> 54:14.681
Well you said you were out on principle.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.325
Jack might still be willing to pitch in?

54:32.440 --> 54:38.163
So Jack is out. Nelson is already spoken for. Chips is unfurtanetly Sterile.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.444
And sleeping across religios lines isnt forbbiden

54:40.560 --> 54:43.689
per say, in my faith but

54:45.440 --> 54:49.490
sleeping with a partner whos not otherwise chased, is.

54:52.440 --> 54:53.646
Which leaves Mr. Zimit

54:58.680 --> 55:00.250
We do need to multiply.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.441
What, right now?

55:30.040 --> 55:31.121
Petra?

55:36.960 --> 55:39.247
Petra, just because I don't want to sleep with you anymore

55:39.360 --> 55:41.203
doesn't mean I don't love you anymore.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.601
It's not working

57:43.640 --> 57:44.721
whats not working?

57:45.080 --> 57:48.926
Four women in prime physical condition, ten weeks of intercouse

57:50.720 --> 57:53.564
no pregnancies. something's not right.

57:54.520 --> 57:56.204
We're ten of the last people on earth

57:57.600 --> 57:58.761
we're stuck in a bunker

58:00.000 --> 58:02.082
and we're under the influence of an atomic war

58:02.440 --> 58:05.489
that for some unknown reason, keeps going on and on

58:06.240 --> 58:08.686
the stress alone is enough to stop conception.

58:09.480 --> 58:12.882
The uteros ins't stupid, it knows what it's doing

58:13.320 --> 58:15.527
evidently it still needs some help.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.807
I don't like the sound of that.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.204
Do you really still not see it?

58:20.320 --> 58:22.129
We're not here just to save ourselves

58:22.440 --> 58:24.807
we're here to make sure that human life continues

58:25.760 --> 58:28.286
reproducing is our highest priority

58:33.880 --> 58:35.291
multiple partners for the girls

58:38.240 --> 58:40.811
and this time all of the boys are going to have to contribute

58:40.920 --> 58:42.285
to maximize our odds.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.843
No matter how much one of them doesn't like it.

58:47.320 --> 58:49.721
We are pushing logic hard to try to survive

58:51.920 --> 58:55.208
we are extreme philosophers becouse we have big problems to solve

58:56.760 --> 59:00.367
but philosophy isn't morality and even logic has it's limit

59:03.280 --> 59:05.203
so let me explain this to you.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.971
You will not force me, to be with any boy

59:12.080 --> 59:15.687
other than the one I want to be with or different boys on different nights.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.687
If you try. I will kill you.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.086
Get up! get up, all of you! out! Out

59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.247
Out! all of you, out! not you.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.408
Go! now! move!

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.804
Human beings were built with a design flaw

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.009
we believe what we feel rather than what is

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.011
which means that the weaker minded among us are...

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.725
easily suede by impassioned arguments. even when they're very bad ideas

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.486
I wont have you debating us into extinction.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.647
I'll say what I want, if you don't like it, shoot me.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.001
No!!!

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.731
One more round? we can do better!

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.168
I have a question. Why did you cough before?

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.087
What?

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.410
Right after I picked my card you had a sort of. . coughing fit.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.887
And you had another one right after Petra picked hers.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.011
You haven't coughed since it's... It's curious.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.881
I took a cough drop.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.048
I din't notice, and I've been looking right at you

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.888
it has secret compartments
, it's like a magicians box.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.730
These all say the same thing

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.290
Organic farmer, whos gay

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.605
that's why you had me go first

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.683
so any card I picked would have been the same.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.404
Then you switched them out so any card Petra picked

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.567
would have been the same

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.244
then you switch in all the random cards for everybody else

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.163
first you made me important

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.285
by making me a farmer

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.883
then you made me irrelevant by making me gay.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.371
Which is relevant and awesome if it's real but

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.646
why rig it? just to cut me out of the gene pool?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.251
I get that you never though I was smart enough for your class

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.848
does it really offend you that much that I'm here?

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.525
Becouse that's one seriously demented vandetta

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.041
agaisnt one harmlessly mediocre student.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.006
You remember the anegree of Plató's cave?

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.161
Yeah.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.767
Sum it up.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.521
A person lives his entire life from when he is a little kid

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.803
chained to a wall inside a cave, were all he ever sees are shadows

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.365
and all he ever hears are echoes

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.805
so. . he assumes thats what reality really looks like and sounds like

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.767
then one day he is unchained and he

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.325
realizes there were bodies casting the shadows

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.084
and voices making the echoes

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.288
his whole idea of what was real was just an illusion.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.650
That sounds a bit like you

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.327
Only in your case, chained by privilage and good luck

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.401
watching shadows of beautifull shapes

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.965
and hearing echoes of success

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.041
and thinking "thats how things trully, rightfully and eternally are".

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.769
Well now you got a glimpse through that illusion

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.810
I wouln't call that a vandetta, James

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.485
I'd call it a tutorial.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.561
I can tell your lying to me, I just don't know what about.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.328
If you really wanted to enlightent me or disillusioned me or whatever your deciding to call it.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.091
I still don't understand why you

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.440
bother making me a farmer.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.728
Why not a, I don't know, a florist? so I'd never make the cut at all.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.445
You know what? I do want another round.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.129
You havent had enough philosophy for one day?

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.890
I wanna go again. let's reset and get our doomsday on, one more time.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.207
Please, can we not?

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.000
I'd like to do another.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.606
Let's do another one.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.487
Great.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.841
Just one thing this time, you are a florist.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.361
Are we early?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.729
Nothing yet. I'll do a quick check.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.803
Looks like you could use some company.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.327
Can I give you a hug?

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.961
Why?

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.122
Becouse I know how hard this has been on you.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.328
I'm going to change things now

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:23.481
you're not going to like it.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.363
I have a proposition to make

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:36.283
we've had trouble deciding who gets a slot the past few times

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.206
but I have a different way we could go, if your willing.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.564
You all know me. you know what kind of person I am, for better or for worse

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.041
so I'd like to be in charge of who's in and who's out

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.245
and if you agree I promise I'll use my very best and fairest judgment

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.768
I'm staying out of it, you have to find your own fate now.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.121
Is this a joke?

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.925
As is, your staying out of it?

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.810
Have an obligation to step back in

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.366
If I see a student about to walk off a cliff

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.846
this is who you want to let in?

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.091
A wine auctioneer?

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.050
She has a genius I. Q

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.204
which made her smart enough to pack a case of red and a case of white

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.322
into the boat for our field trip.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:42.440
That's a shame. becouse that A+ just vanished into thin air.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.131
A fashion designer?

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.443
Dressing well boost self esteem

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.604
self-esteem promotes productivity

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.041
productivity rebuilds civilization.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.161
A-

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.161
Petra this is disorder. The poet?

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.127
The poet, we would've known if you'd let him describe himself

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.608
he is also a champion poker player

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.685
and he brought his cards.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.488
The harpist has autism!

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.961
Some people consider autism a gift.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.366
B+

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.563
She was exposed to the ebola virus last week.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.643
I'm praying she wasn't infected.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.447
Down to a "B"

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.244
she's an opera singer thats struck with cancer

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.124
and can't even speak in three years

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.367
whats the point?

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.765
We could be dead in three days, I'd like to fall sleep to music

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.126
before it's all over.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.850
B -

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.401
Jack, you've got the beautifull difference in your favor

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.968
and we need to make sure a virtue like that stays in the gene pool

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.842
Sorry I don't mean to sound ungreatfull

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.885
but I'm I the only one who won't have anyone in here to be with

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.766
there isn't anyone now

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.971
but what about in here? can we carry over?

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.165
Wait sorry, you want someone whos not out, to come out right now?

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.688
Just to sleep with you in a thought experiment.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.168
We graduate tommorow, nows a good time to make a move.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.964
Out of 20 of us, statisticly, theres gotta be somebody else.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.809
Really? nobody?

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.001
Parker?! get in.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.801
You have two slots left. Choose.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:20.049
No, he's a florist, theres no way you can justify it.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.082
You're willing to go through life defending yourself

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.362
everytime someone checks your transcript?

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.451
Explaining that you really were the best student in the class

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:43.841
but you almost fail becouse... I dont't know what?

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.921
I won't let you do it.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.120
Get out of there! Get out!

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.370
Get Out!

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.607
Are you looking for this?

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.966
Can I give you a hug?

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.291
I'm going to give back to you now

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.721
you're going to walk away and find your own faith with it.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.685
Put these away, you'll have them if you need them

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.007
Put them away!

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.688
Put the bullets away and go!

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:39.369
You can't shoot me, you're a pacifist.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.081
I'll make an exception.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.166
You won't know the exit code without me

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.251
7-3-8-7-2

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.401
eidetic memory.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.326
Petra, get in.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.766
I din't ask to run this so I could save myself

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.171
It's the last slot, Petra!

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.683
Bonnie, get inside.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.441
I'm a soldier, I know how to knock things down, you're an engineers you know how to build things up.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.007
I'm not worth as much.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.651
My logic's fuzzier

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.362
in my apocalypse everybody is worth as much as everybody else

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.402
no.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.965
I'm not letting you sacrifice yourself to save me

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.162
I won't let you sacrifice yourself to save me.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.202
Then we'll both go up in smoke

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.163
and you'll have wasted a slot for someone to live.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.927
Chips?

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.289
Petra. I't doesn't matter about the slots, we have to go now.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.650
We'll take the boat and get away.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.571
We'll find an island outside the detonation zone

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.361
theres still time.

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.730
Petra! I have the keys to the boat.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.845
Let's go. Let's go!

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.526
So we settle in for a year inside a bunker

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.846
keeping safe from an atomic holocaust

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.081
and dispite the horrific circumstances,

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.606
which should have made everyone of us absolutly miserable,

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.766
somehow, we had fun.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.091
Toby's cards help

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.081
and good wine

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.083
and poker kept our spirits up

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.811
specially since Plum had been genorous enough to leave us her gold

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.120
and when Mitzy confessed

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.086
she always brought along something a bit stronger on out of town trips

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.123
some of us were glad to know it.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.046
Then there was Shakespear.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.766
And once a month we had an original poem.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.765
And now and then, late at night, on of us danced

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.683
becouse if you don't know what a gelato maker

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.802
is practicing in his spare time

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.570
you don't know the whole story.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:52.567
One good thing about the apocalypse: all the extra time we are going to have together.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.683
Becouse I might need the next 20 or

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.806
30 years just to tell you everyway I love you.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.210
Now you say it back to me.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.360
I like your nose

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.281
and?

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.647
The way you smile

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.287
and I love your terrible poems

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.566
theres a girl I know named Petra,

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.850
shes smart and cute, etc,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.080
I like her hair, it's blond and fair

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.848
and I'm really glad I metcha.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.168
So you only like me for the things I do badly?

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.121
No.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.126
We had an universe to ourselves for a while

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.765
and in our universe

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.730
we had art, we had literature and we had engineering.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.369
The machine room was a trobe of spare parts

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.606
puzzle pieces for all kinds of acts of creation and cunstruction

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.807
and engineers do love puzzles

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.091
specially in the service of their friends

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.001
becouse a harpist without a harp isn't a liability

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.367
only a riddle to solve.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.683
And finally we prayed

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.247
we prayed for our friends who wern't with us

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.526
we prayed for the other survivors around the world

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.450
we prayed for the animals who din't have safe places to wait out the trouble

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.408
we prayed for our parents we prayed to god

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.569
there was some kind of greater plan in the works.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.125
And then the year was up.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.685
The bombs never fell

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.206
we're ok.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.040
You mean, your alive?

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.961
And here is what I predict happens next.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.722
True, the bombs never felt where you are

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.047
But the rest of the world was decimated

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.170
but since you're mostly defficient in skillsets of practical value

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.805
you can never get back to yakarta

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.288
or build new shelters or even grow food and feed yourselves

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.086
so you die off.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.607
Becouse where you are, only the smartest survive.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.962
Tragic and powerfull, But wrong.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.767
We live... briefly... yes

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.291
Imperfectly? of course.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.363
Stupidly? sometimes.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:11.323
But we don't mind, becouse thats the way we're made.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.529
And when it's time to die

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.329
we don't resist death, we summon it.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.401
This is not philosophy., anymore.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.487
How are you here?

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.481
I found a cave.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.160
I went deep enough down

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.763
to avoid the raditation, that I now see, never came.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.601
After a few months, I lost track of time

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.770
and then I heard you.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.121
I have one bullet left

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.769
which I will use to kill you, if you need me to

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.042
to stop you from commiting an act so urreasonable

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.727
it might end the human race.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.362
So, can I just say? a tip of the top hat to our boy Chips.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.844
You chose your love life over your actual life in that bunker

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.281
I saw it on your face when you made up your mind to go for the girl.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.602
Petra, I have the keys to the boat.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.244
Let's go, Let's go!

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.726
That did not fail to impress

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.767
you know what, that's not exactly what happened.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.881
We're listening.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.128
Ok so I ran a little thought experiment

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.083
inside our thought experiment.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.770
I din't think anyone would mind if I fiddle with things, just a bit

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.167
and your thought experiment has hit what premise?

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.682
Whats the point of living if you can't have sex?

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.247
Really!?

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.887
Yeah, I was just a sterile kid in a bunker

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.885
everybody else was starting to pair up to save the human race

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.891
sex for procreation only, so I would've been the odd man out

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.528
or I could be one man with... six women all to myself.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.810
So I found another uninhabited island outside the detonation zone...

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.964
Hold it, I was on that boat too, what happened to me?

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.961
Drowned.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.961
And me?

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.966
Barracuda attack?

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.881
What about me?

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:56.327
Ah Andy, the day that we arrive at the new island, you had a run in with the palm tree.

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.930
You turned to bone by the end of the week becouse of your hideous disease.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.368
So it was just myself and the ladies.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.000
Me being a carpenter, I built a shelter

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.441
we set up shop.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.083
Had a girl for each night of the week and on the seventh night, I rested.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.529
Um, excuse me you're sterile

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.165
why would we have sex with you at all?

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:23.444
Ah, becouse thats the flip side to my thought experiment

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.171
what do you do if you're six girls?

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.408
And you need to start repopulating the human race?

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.085
You've only got one man to work with?

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.250
And he's infertile? you try, try and try again.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.921
Any specialist can tell you that in someone my age

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.486
infertility is more often than not, sub-fertility.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.922
Meaning, even if the odds are only 1 in 1,000

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.203
that I can get the job done, theres still a chance

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.846
so yeah, I had defective semen

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.567
But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.891
Well friends, I believe Chips has just settle the old question:

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.166
is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.121
And the answer is?

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.647
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.446
six girls? that's nicely done.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:18.346
Just putting to good use my large sex organ

01:33:19.046 --> 01:33:20.646
my brain.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.686
Thanks for that, Chips.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.965
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.361
You trouble me, Eric,

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.248
taking out your issues with me on James.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.844
Not your finest hour.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.205
He ins't smart enough for you.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.405
How can you still not see it?

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:18.482
Being smart ins't everything, has it done for you just what you hoped?

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:29.607
Punishing him makes no sense... becouse he doesn't know about us.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.010
I'm not sure he needs to know.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.528
Specially after the way you behaved today.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.768
I love him, so leave him alone.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.123
Guess thats why you din't

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.361
I just coulnt put all the pieces together

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.561
who could?

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.481
You.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.247
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.163
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.450
I still don't understand how he got in

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.930
I wrote his essay for him.

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.927
Did you?

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.721
No.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.525
The winters are brood in Ithaca. you'll be cold.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.050
I'll buy a sweater.

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.246
You honestly believe

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.727
that James as of this world can keep up with you?

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.209
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.969
can anyone possibly accusse him of being innadecuate

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.488
you want me to skip college?

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.807
And stay in yakarta? is that what you're asking me to do?

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.409
There are some, outstanding universities in this city.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:05.362
Can you imagine, how good we'd be for eachother?

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.841
Yes.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.529
But you do know that can't happen.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.601
Of course I know.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.881
Do you know what "apocalypse" actually means?

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.847
Tell me.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.206
It's from the greek.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:40.163
"Apokalypsis" meaning to uncover what you couln't see before

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.005
way out of the dark.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.889
You're sweet talk still needs work.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.006
I'll get on that.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.804
You're a very good teacher, Eric.
