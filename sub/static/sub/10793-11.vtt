00:00.278 --> 00:03.761
<i>This is what destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

00:03.881 --> 00:08.801
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

00:10.138 --> 00:13.292
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason.

00:13.412 --> 00:16.981
<i>Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.</i>

00:17.101 --> 00:19.450
He and young
are bumping heads, yes.

00:19.570 --> 00:22.187
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:22.307 --> 00:23.789
I don't even know
what to do with myself.

00:23.909 --> 00:26.291
I'm the last person
who should be here.

00:26.411 --> 00:28.127
You're the wrong man
for the job, colonel.

00:28.247 --> 00:30.648
You don't believe
in the mission.

00:30.936 --> 00:34.620
- Neural interface?
- A repository of knowledge

00:34.740 --> 00:36.822
that can be literally
downloaded into one's mind.

00:36.942 --> 00:38.825
Do you know what a device like
this did to General O'Neill?

00:38.945 --> 00:40.827
The sheer amount of information
overwhelmed him, yes.

00:40.947 --> 00:41.894
It damn near killed him.

00:42.014 --> 00:45.298
Young is not going to listen,
and Dr. Rush, well, like you said,

00:45.418 --> 00:48.302
he's in no hurry to come home.

00:48.422 --> 00:50.938
Well, the convulsions have stopped,
but he's completely unresponsive.

00:51.058 --> 00:53.207
- You just couldn't wait, could you?
- Anyone who had access to that room

00:53.327 --> 00:54.943
was under strict orders
not to sit in that chair.

00:55.063 --> 00:56.778
You knew!
You wanted somebody there

00:56.898 --> 00:59.748
because you didn't have the
guts to do it yourself!

00:59.868 --> 01:03.051
This is obviously someone trying to
undermine the colonel's authority.

01:03.171 --> 01:04.186
We cannot let that happen!

01:04.306 --> 01:06.706
Somebody's trying to frame me, Eli.

01:07.398 --> 01:11.466
- Where's Rush?
- He didn't make it.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.598 --> 01:54.511
No headaches?

01:54.546 --> 01:56.435
- Ah, any blurry vision?
- I'm fine.

01:56.470 --> 01:58.897
You sleeping okay?

01:58.932 --> 02:01.880
TJ, I'm good. I gotta go.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.258
Sir…you lost someone under your command.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.549
Most recently, three people:
Gorman, Spencer, and Rush.

02:12.596 --> 02:13.985
It happens.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.316
Well, I know how much it affects you.

02:16.351 --> 02:18.913
In different ways, I let them down.

02:18.948 --> 02:20.927
So, if you ever want to
talk about it, I'm here.

02:20.962 --> 02:23.003
I don't.
You should.

02:23.038 --> 02:24.905
I'm sorry?

02:25.870 --> 02:28.387
Like you said,
you felt like you let Sgt. Spencer down.

02:28.422 --> 02:30.345
We all do.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.736
And there's been a lot going
on between you and Rush.

02:32.771 --> 02:34.521
What are you saying?
That emotionally,

02:34.556 --> 02:37.008
a lot has been left unresolved.

02:37.363 --> 02:39.291
Another time.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.882
Colonel…

02:45.917 --> 02:48.286
off to, uh, file your
latest report back to Earth?

02:48.321 --> 02:51.439
That's right.

02:51.474 --> 02:55.898
you intend to provide regarding
the incident with…Dr. Rush.

02:55.933 --> 02:58.098
Exactly what happened.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.109
I'm…scheduled to file my report
with Earth later today,

03:02.144 --> 03:06.687
and it may cast some doubt
on your version of events.

03:06.722 --> 03:08.791
There were only two people
on that planet:

03:08.826 --> 03:10.449
me and Rush.

03:10.484 --> 03:13.276
I'm talking about the obvious issues
between the two of you.

03:13.311 --> 03:16.711
That doesn't change anything.
Listen, if you want to accuse me,

03:16.746 --> 03:19.578
you should have the guts
to come right out and accuse me.

03:19.613 --> 03:21.726
I don't have proof of anything.

03:21.761 --> 03:23.534
I think you just want to
be in charge again.

03:23.569 --> 03:25.262
I'm saying you had plenty of motive.

03:25.297 --> 03:26.733
Really?

03:26.768 --> 03:30.419
Do you think that I want people
on this ship suspecting me of murder?

03:30.454 --> 03:33.754
Maybe that burden's easier to bear
than actually dealing with Rush.

03:33.789 --> 03:37.232
Well, I'll admit it,
I don't miss the man.

03:49.193 --> 03:51.425
I say we're all better off.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.079
Oh, well, that's reassuring.

03:53.114 --> 03:55.889
So if you don't measure up,
you just get left for dead?

03:56.064 --> 03:59.725
What-what exactly is the criteria
then for sticking around?

03:59.883 --> 04:03.161
Do you agree?
All right. Let's do this.

04:03.196 --> 04:05.299
Let's do it.

04:10.676 --> 04:13.451
All good?
All good.

04:15.862 --> 04:17.547
Hey, Eli. Hey,

04:17.582 --> 04:20.052
when you get a chance,
can you check the shower system?

04:20.087 --> 04:23.454
- The pressure's been kind of low.
Sure, once I'm done here.

04:24.603 --> 04:26.821
Dr. Caine's pretty cute, huh?

04:26.856 --> 04:29.222
There is nothing sexier than a widower.

04:29.257 --> 04:31.275
A man who's proven that he
can make a commitment,

04:31.310 --> 04:33.697
and is single through
no fault of his own.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.402
I mean, what more
could you ask for?

04:36.437 --> 04:38.735
I can hear you.

04:39.976 --> 04:42.835
Uh…I-I…I'm so sorry.

04:43.426 --> 04:46.878
How about we just, uh,
carry on like nothing happened?

04:46.913 --> 04:49.951
Okay. Thank you.

04:52.228 --> 04:54.890
God.
Kill me now.

04:57.106 --> 05:00.072
All right.
I think we're ready.

06:07.273 --> 06:14.073
STARGATE UNIVERSE
01x11- Vesmír

06:21.453 --> 06:25.500
Welcome aboard Destiny.
I'm Lt. Matthew Scott.

06:32.318 --> 06:35.301
You okay?
Ex-excuse me.

06:36.445 --> 06:39.180
Who are you?

06:58.615 --> 07:00.675
Sergeant, what happened?

07:00.710 --> 07:03.401
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

07:08.007 --> 07:09.950
What do you think?

07:09.985 --> 07:13.356
Uh…I'm an IT tech. You know,
I fix Earth computers,

07:13.391 --> 07:16.042
not Ancient communication devices.

07:16.599 --> 07:19.680
Malfunction in the connection?
That's quite a hiccup.

07:19.715 --> 07:21.209
I've seen worse.

07:21.244 --> 07:25.230
We don't exactly know what
these stones do, do we?

07:25.231 --> 07:27.058
Well, no, not personally.

07:27.093 --> 07:31.466
I- I just got put on stone duty 'cause
Riley's not back on his feet yet.

07:31.501 --> 07:33.949
You know, sir, you have been
under quite a bit of stress.

07:33.984 --> 07:36.905
Oh, you're not suggesting
that I imagined it?

07:38.202 --> 07:39.829
No.

07:39.864 --> 07:43.153
Whoever took over your body
was acting kinda strangely.

07:43.188 --> 07:47.389
Look, there was no way that
I hallucinated that ship or that alien.

07:47.424 --> 07:50.105
My imagination isn't that good.

07:50.611 --> 07:54.216
I was on a ship. And I saw an alien.

07:55.078 --> 07:56.689
Now,

07:56.724 --> 08:00.061
I want to know exactly what happened,
what went wrong, and why

08:00.096 --> 08:04.581
And until then, the communications room
and that device are off limits.

08:04.616 --> 08:06.599
Understood?

08:29.152 --> 08:31.906
You got a minute?
Please, sit.

08:32.124 --> 08:34.097
You know, I always figured
that limited resources meant

08:34.133 --> 08:36.351
that every day would be
a struggle for survival,

08:36.385 --> 08:39.126
but I never thought
it would come to this.

08:39.162 --> 08:42.248
Is that supposed to be some sort of hint?
Yeah, it's a hint.

08:42.283 --> 08:45.593
If you're wondering what to get me
for Christmas, I need socks.

08:46.858 --> 08:49.921
I heard about today's "incident".

08:49.956 --> 08:52.100
Caine's looking into it.

08:52.947 --> 08:55.402
You know, I find it interesting

08:55.437 --> 08:59.861
that the device just happens to malfunction moments
after we had our conversation this morning.

08:59.896 --> 09:03.147
I guess it's kind of coincidental.

09:03.182 --> 09:06.853
That's one word. Another is "convenient"
And another is "surprising".

09:06.888 --> 09:09.259
Okay, your turn.

09:10.368 --> 09:12.720
You actually think that…

09:12.755 --> 09:15.512
this will keep me from filing
my report back to Earth.

09:15.547 --> 09:18.924
Actually, yeah. No, no,
I'm pretty sure it will.

09:24.382 --> 09:26.386
When the time comes,

09:26.421 --> 09:29.604
let's hope that those who sit
in judgment of you

09:29.639 --> 09:32.079
grant the mercy you denied Dr. Rush.

09:32.114 --> 09:35.861
I believe you mean "allegedly"
denied Dr. Rush.

09:36.196 --> 09:40.216
Communications with Earth will
resume as soon as I am completely satisfied

09:40.251 --> 09:44.139
that the next attempt to connect will
not result in another coincidence,

09:44.174 --> 09:47.700
or a convenience, or a surprise.

10:04.463 --> 10:06.143
Thank you.

10:06.729 --> 10:11.524
We have tomatoes!
We finally have tomatoes!

10:11.559 --> 10:13.687
More or less.

10:22.193 --> 10:24.414
Wow, that's odd.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.683
So, I was talking to Dr. Inman,

10:28.718 --> 10:30.586
and she said the hydroponics team

10:30.621 --> 10:33.730
will have strawberries for us in about a month.
Sort of strawberries.

10:33.765 --> 10:36.051
Talk to me when they can
finally start growing meat.

10:36.086 --> 10:39.130
Well, actually, I hear they're
working on a soy-based protein.

10:39.165 --> 10:43.276
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
Enjoy your tofurkey!

10:44.127 --> 10:46.382
You're in a bad mood.

10:46.529 --> 10:49.392
What's the matter?
I haven't slept much.

10:49.886 --> 10:51.617
Col. Young has me working
around the clock

10:51.652 --> 10:54.504
trying to figure out everything
that Rush was working on.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.069
You can't be serious.

10:57.443 --> 11:00.246
Colonel Young was willing
to sacrifice his own life

11:00.281 --> 11:02.448
so that one of us could have
a shot at getting on the shuttle

11:02.483 --> 11:04.990
when the ship was heading
towards that star.

11:05.025 --> 11:06.995
You think he's a cold-blooded murderer?

11:07.030 --> 11:10.409
I wasn't saying that. I was…
It-it's fine.

11:14.516 --> 11:17.397
Can you believe it? Tomatoes!

11:20.788 --> 11:22.771
What?

11:22.784 --> 11:26.950
…and from the second we got on this ship,
they've been the ones calling all the shots.

11:26.985 --> 11:30.033
What we eat, where we sleep,
what we do and when

11:30.068 --> 11:31.993
And we just sit back and let them.

11:32.028 --> 11:34.688
Yeah, they're the ones with the guns.

11:34.723 --> 11:38.074
Yeah, I mean, we have
every right to be afraid.

11:38.855 --> 11:42.548
Look at what happened to
the last person to challenge them.

11:43.057 --> 11:44.654
So...

11:44.979 --> 11:47.541
what do you think we should do?

11:49.541 --> 11:51.790
I don't know…

12:00.301 --> 12:03.336
Purple plants?
Are you kidding me?

12:03.371 --> 12:06.973
Well, purple chlorophyll is sensitive
to red and infrared light.

12:07.008 --> 12:09.310
Planet's probably orbiting a red-dwarf.

12:09.345 --> 12:11.995
Well, the kino says breathable
atmosphere Water and oxygen.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.949
I'm concerned about potential
stellar flare activity.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.005
Spot radiation.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.656
All right, then. We'll suit up.

12:25.467 --> 12:29.020
Sirs! You've got to see this.

12:34.828 --> 12:37.228
It just showed up.

12:59.519 --> 13:02.107
Eli?
Bringing it up…

13:02.142 --> 13:03.972
now.

13:13.032 --> 13:15.799
What is it doing?
Nothing. Yet.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.135
It's just sitting there.

13:18.829 --> 13:20.813
Maybe we should try
communicating with it?

13:20.848 --> 13:22.347
How?

13:22.382 --> 13:24.839
Uh, well, we have broadcast capability.

13:24.874 --> 13:27.869
Of course, there's no way
in hell they'd understand us.

13:28.085 --> 13:29.583
Eli..

13:29.737 --> 13:33.179
But I guess there's only
one way to find out.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.821
Two alien encounters
in a day, what are the chances?

13:38.856 --> 13:41.932
I'm thinking likely…zero.

13:41.967 --> 13:45.159
Okay, sending…now.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.996
Let's hope they speak Ancient.

13:49.534 --> 13:52.850
There is no way this is a coincidence.
I bet you I was on that ship this morning.

13:52.885 --> 13:55.523
You figure you piqued their curiosity?
They came here to check on us?

13:55.558 --> 13:58.302
I'm thinking they've been
checking on us for a while.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.401
There is no other way to have
found us so fast.

14:02.347 --> 14:04.848
They…answered back.

14:13.092 --> 14:16.494
That's not a translation.

14:16.552 --> 14:19.027
They answered in English.
I mean, how the hell is that possible?

14:19.062 --> 14:21.218
- I...
- What did you say?

14:21.253 --> 14:24.228
Hello. W-we're peaceful humans
from planet Earth.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.055
We mean you no harm, and
we'd like to meet you."

14:26.090 --> 14:28.980
What do I do? Wh-what do I say back?
Nothing.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.948
Nothing?
Nothing. Get our weapons online.

14:31.983 --> 14:35.970
This is Colonel Young. All personnel,
report to designated areas.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.063
Lieutenant, I need you and
Greer in that shuttle.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.978
Yes, sir.

14:50.239 --> 14:52.768
Something's happening.

14:58.838 --> 15:02.714
I- I think they're launching
smaller ships.

15:07.971 --> 15:10.106
Oh, my god.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.006
Uh…only 30% of the weapons
are coming online.

15:17.007 --> 15:19.289
Rush put limits on how many
could be activated at once.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.840
Right, right,
after what happened to Riley.

15:20.864 --> 15:23.613
We were still in the process of
checking each gun's functionality.

15:23.742 --> 15:26.081
Well, find a way
around it, Eli

15:49.487 --> 15:51.589
Disengaging.

16:15.347 --> 16:16.729
Eli, come on.

16:16.764 --> 16:20.672
Hey, hey, first real
space battle over here!

16:30.969 --> 16:33.017
You got it? You got it?
Just about.

16:45.824 --> 16:48.219
Eli. Activate the forward battery.

16:48.254 --> 16:50.614
That's what I'm trying to do!

17:01.326 --> 17:03.044
Come on, get back.

17:03.079 --> 17:04.743
Let's go!

17:17.767 --> 17:19.994
We're taking heavy fire.
Can you

17:20.030 --> 17:21.788
boost power to the shields?
I'm workin' on it.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.657
Shield power is being drained
by the weapons.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.614
Come, move, go.

17:34.813 --> 17:36.603
Stay back.

17:38.409 --> 17:40.272
We've got surges happening all
over the ship.

17:40.307 --> 17:42.380
The weapons system wasn't
ready for this.

17:42.381 --> 17:44.433
Eli, everyone on board
this ship is counting on you.

17:44.468 --> 17:47.565
I don't need to hear that.
You can do this.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.081
No. No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.058
Why is this all on me, okay?
What about him?

17:52.059 --> 17:53.613
I don't care. Both of you.

17:53.648 --> 17:56.127
I need this ship working now!

17:56.162 --> 17:59.537
You should've thought
of that before you got rid of Rush.

18:00.491 --> 18:02.401
Just fix it.

18:53.953 --> 18:55.716
You guys okay?
Yeah.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.006
Check her.
Okay.

19:50.171 --> 19:52.263
They're pulling back.

20:17.402 --> 20:20.400
Colonel Young, this is Airman
Dunning. Please respond.

20:22.878 --> 20:26.014
They're retreating.
We got 'em on the run.

20:26.273 --> 20:29.134
Let's give 'em something
to remember us by.

20:37.759 --> 20:40.423
Lieutenant, I need you to end
pursuit and fall back to Destiny.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.735
But, sir…!
Do not engage. I repeat. Do not engage.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.535
Chloe may be on board
one of those ships.

21:03.168 --> 21:04.518
What the hell happened?
Easy, Lieutenant.

21:04.519 --> 21:06.824
It was nobody's fault.
We were not ready for this.

21:06.859 --> 21:10.101
They gave up pretty quickly.
Well, the attack may have been a distraction

21:10.136 --> 21:12.837
to try to come in close and take
prisoners. Try to gain intel.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.292
Why are we the enemy?
I don't know.

21:15.293 --> 21:17.503
Sir, that ship is still
within shuttle range.

21:17.538 --> 21:19.345
Request permission to take—
Permission denied.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.298
You wouldn't stand a chance.
With me.

21:21.299 --> 21:23.300
What are we going to do?
I'm going after her.

21:23.301 --> 21:25.569
- How?
- The communication device.

21:25.570 --> 21:27.584
Sir, you are only assuming that's
the same ship that you were on…

21:27.619 --> 21:30.005
Guess I'll find out
when I'm on-board.

22:01.651 --> 22:03.040
Let's elevate this.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.363
Have a seat over there, and I'll get to
you as soon as I can, okay?

22:05.398 --> 22:07.316
Thanks so much.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.102
Anything I can do?
Take your pick.

22:11.309 --> 22:13.676
Grab some gauze.
Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch.

22:14.101 --> 22:17.148
- Chloe was taken.
- What? How?

22:17.851 --> 22:20.690
One of the ships latched on,
cut a hole.

22:20.725 --> 22:23.974
I can't get a pulse over here!
Grab the bag!

22:24.009 --> 22:26.057
Keep the pressure on
him, please.

22:29.216 --> 22:30.691
Caine…
Yeah.

22:30.726 --> 22:33.183
Caine, we need you.
It's not bad.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.856
We are still
working on it.

22:40.011 --> 22:42.461
Okay, that's good.

22:45.857 --> 22:47.811
Tighter.

22:50.348 --> 22:53.987
Sir…Sir! Let me do it.

22:54.022 --> 22:56.747
Lieutenant, it's not going to happen.

22:56.929 --> 22:59.531
For the record, I think
this is a very bad idea.

22:59.566 --> 23:03.119
Yes, but is the best
of bad ideas.

23:05.747 --> 23:07.529
Go.

23:07.530 --> 23:10.150
I think I got most of the
weapons back online.

23:10.185 --> 23:12.450
How long is he going in for?
Twenty minutes. Then we pull him out.

23:12.485 --> 23:14.197
Okay.

23:15.903 --> 23:18.566
Colonel, you can always go back
in if you don't find her.

23:18.574 --> 23:20.541
Okay?

24:28.182 --> 24:32.752
We are not your enemy.
We mean you no harm.

24:35.462 --> 24:38.067
I don't think it understands you.

24:38.279 --> 24:40.295
Th-they spoke English.

24:40.330 --> 24:42.152
They sent a one word message.

24:42.187 --> 24:44.083
For all we know, they have
a translation device

24:44.118 --> 24:47.274
on their ship or something.
Then they would've sent it in Ancient.

24:47.309 --> 24:49.564
Why did you attack us?

26:17.459 --> 26:21.429
Why did you take one
of our people prisoner?

26:42.854 --> 26:44.832
Why did you do that?

26:48.417 --> 26:50.350
You want to help me?

27:07.181 --> 27:10.147
This is how you read my mind.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.986
Do you understand?

27:16.911 --> 27:19.159
This one transmits.

27:20.175 --> 27:22.300
This one receives.

27:29.092 --> 27:32.151
Like this. Here.
Like this. Yeah.

27:57.152 --> 27:59.048
Colonel Young!

28:01.124 --> 28:03.561
- What happened?
- He's back.

28:03.752 --> 28:06.960
What just happened?
The alien ship is closing in on us.

28:33.652 --> 28:35.753
Send me back.

28:37.130 --> 28:39.385
Send me back now!

28:46.631 --> 28:48.707
Okay. Good to go.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.368
Ready.

28:57.108 --> 29:00.316
It's not working.
Why isn't it working?

29:03.079 --> 29:04.922
Untie me.

29:28.403 --> 29:31.225
There doesn't seem to be
anything wrong with the device

29:31.260 --> 29:33.269
Did you find Chloe?

29:35.815 --> 29:39.593
Uh, guys? You may have noticed
they're attacking us again.

29:41.023 --> 29:42.723
Eli..

29:42.758 --> 29:45.428
Our shields aren't going
to hold for much longer.

29:45.463 --> 29:50.043
Bring the main weapon online.
Fire on the big ship.

29:50.211 --> 29:52.468
Chloe is still on board that ship!

29:52.503 --> 29:57.151
Do it now, Eli! Return fire.
Everything we've got.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.622
We can't keep this up. The whole
weapons system is overloading.

30:34.657 --> 30:37.851
Shields are down almost fifty percent
I know.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.699
Where are you going?
To try and save Chloe.

30:44.357 --> 30:47.335
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.559
We have to go. Here.

31:02.796 --> 31:04.508
Oh, god.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.728
Where are we going?

31:08.875 --> 31:10.871
This way.

31:19.329 --> 31:21.730
Report!
Bad and more bad.

31:21.765 --> 31:24.596
Too much power is going to the weapons.
Our shields are going to fail.

31:24.631 --> 31:28.879
Bolster the shield. Devote all remaining
weapons power to the main weapon.

31:28.914 --> 31:31.471
Keep firing on the big ship.

31:39.270 --> 31:42.108
Not like you, taking the
shuttle without asking.

31:42.143 --> 31:44.428
He'll say no, and I don't
want to disobey an order

31:44.463 --> 31:47.293
You gotta problem with that?
You want to save her,

31:47.328 --> 31:49.686
do it.
I'm going.

31:49.721 --> 31:52.766
You don't have to.
I'm already here.

31:55.709 --> 31:58.194
They're retreating.
Keep firing!

31:58.229 --> 32:01.012
We fire again, and we
risk blowing ourselves up.

32:01.047 --> 32:04.019
I don't have a choice.
Do it.

32:06.857 --> 32:09.391
They're…
they're retreating.

32:10.348 --> 32:13.293
All of them except that one.

32:17.111 --> 32:18.907
Wait.

32:29.430 --> 32:31.858
They're gone.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.995
Matt!

33:08.315 --> 33:10.238
Colonel Young said you were dead.

33:10.273 --> 33:12.138
Oh, did he?

33:12.139 --> 33:15.209
Did he say how it happened?
Rock slide.

33:15.244 --> 33:18.534
Well, obviously
he was wrong again.

33:21.808 --> 33:24.919
Colonel Young, this is Greer.
Come in.

33:28.158 --> 33:29.909
Go ahead.

33:30.260 --> 33:34.014
You are not going to believe this.

33:46.451 --> 33:50.017
I managed to, uh, activate the…

33:50.052 --> 33:53.301
systems on the crashed ship.

33:53.652 --> 33:55.311
Found a database.

33:55.346 --> 33:58.596
I'd only just begun to look through it

33:58.631 --> 34:00.349
when the aliens showed up.

34:00.350 --> 34:04.966
I guess I must've accidentally
activated some kind of distress beacon.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.991
Anyway, I'm glad I did.
I would've died out there.

34:08.992 --> 34:13.513
Oh, well, there are a few people who
thought Col. Young left you to die on purpose.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.130
I imagine there were

34:16.166 --> 34:20.311
No, no. He would've rightly
assumed that I was gone

34:20.346 --> 34:22.530
…in the rock slide.

34:22.565 --> 34:26.472
So, what happened when the
aliens brought you on their ship?

34:26.654 --> 34:29.270
To be honest?

34:29.304 --> 34:31.996
I don't remember that much.

34:32.705 --> 34:35.281
The few times
I was conscious they were...

34:35.315 --> 34:37.916
Probing my mind.

34:39.471 --> 34:42.170
That's something
I'd rather not think about, really.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.078
I know they were frustrated.

34:44.112 --> 34:48.699
I seemed to be able to resist giving
them the information they wanted.

34:48.735 --> 34:51.435
He used their own neural
interface against them,

34:51.469 --> 34:53.600
getting what he needed
so we could escape.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.629
Location of their fighter bay.

34:55.664 --> 34:58.079
Basic operating systems.

34:58.114 --> 34:59.886
Anything else?

34:59.921 --> 35:02.369
Like, why they wanted to destroy us?

35:02.404 --> 35:04.643
I don't think they did want
to destroy us.

35:04.678 --> 35:08.394
What they really want is Destiny.

35:09.882 --> 35:14.358
Probably only care about us because we

35:14.785 --> 35:20.663
…recently came aboard.

35:21.367 --> 35:25.503
No, what they want is
a way past her defenses.

35:29.928 --> 35:33.126
Unfortunately, I didn't have
time to find out any more.

35:33.310 --> 35:38.339
My first priority was getting
Chloe and I off the ship.

35:40.316 --> 35:42.951
Well, it's good to have you back.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.581
Both of you.

36:07.171 --> 36:10.143
- So...
- So.

36:22.685 --> 36:25.475
I suppose you're wondering

36:26.833 --> 36:30.374
why I didn't tell everyone the truth.
It's your word against mine.

36:30.409 --> 36:32.315
I didn't tell anyone you
tried to frame me

36:32.316 --> 36:34.253
for Spencer's death.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.004
Well, that's true.

36:38.629 --> 36:42.108
No, I-I just wanted to know whether
I can assume

36:42.143 --> 36:45.769
that you are going to try and kill
me again next chance you get.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.217
I saved you from those aliens.

36:49.252 --> 36:52.112
You fired on the alien ship
while I was still aboard.

36:52.147 --> 36:53.589
So was Chloe.

36:53.624 --> 36:57.772
That was a command decision,
protecting the greater good.

36:59.713 --> 37:01.683
Yes, indeed.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.587
Look,

37:04.114 --> 37:08.150
I realize…that I did provoke you.

37:08.185 --> 37:11.514
Well, if it means anything, I,

37:11.549 --> 37:13.677
uh, regret leaving you on that planet.

37:13.712 --> 37:15.683
Don't get me wrong.
I- I think you deserved it.

37:15.718 --> 37:17.973
But I regret that I lost control—

37:18.008 --> 37:21.393
that I became a man that
I couldn't respect anymore.

37:21.692 --> 37:24.489
well, you're here, I'm here.
We just have to live with it, don't we?

37:24.524 --> 37:27.043
Well, so does everyone else on board.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.601
They don't need the distraction.

37:29.864 --> 37:31.631
They don't need to doubt
their leadership.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.940
And this ship needs to be ready
for the next encounter.

37:41.916 --> 37:45.346
If we haven't found a way home by then.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.003
Of course.

37:49.596 --> 37:52.384
So, what?

37:52.419 --> 37:54.857
We just pretend nothing happened?

37:54.892 --> 37:57.963
Well, it's not like
we were ever friends.

38:05.594 --> 38:10.068
- For the sake of the crew.
- For the sake of the crew.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.599
Hey there.
Hi!

38:29.634 --> 38:32.549
You mind?
No, it's okay.

38:37.530 --> 38:40.226
You want to try some?
What is it?

38:40.261 --> 38:43.424
It's a little something that
Dr. Inman's been working on.

38:43.585 --> 38:45.931
She claims it tastes like gin.

38:45.966 --> 38:49.212
I say it's a little closer
to rubbing alcohol.

38:49.447 --> 38:53.567
Solid sales pitch. Um,
no, thank you.

38:53.602 --> 38:57.275
All right.
So, uh,

38:57.631 --> 39:01.302
what do you think? You and James?
Any…any chance there?

39:01.337 --> 39:04.150
It-it could just get really awkward.

39:04.185 --> 39:06.059
You know, if things didn't work out.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.148
I mean, being stuck on this ship

39:08.183 --> 39:10.552
with someone you've had
a bad relationship with?

39:10.587 --> 39:14.286
No, thanks. It's probably best
to just keep things

39:14.321 --> 39:18.124
professional for as long as we can.

39:18.159 --> 39:21.238
I mean, we'll see.
If we're here much longer,

39:21.273 --> 39:25.698
I hereby reserve the right to
completely change my mind.

41:58.245 --> 42:00.647
The Colonel's dangerous.

42:00.682 --> 42:02.801
We need to do something about that.

42:02.836 --> 42:05.897
I tried.
I know.

42:05.932 --> 42:08.695
Damn near killed me for it.

42:09.781 --> 42:13.787
Next time will be different.
