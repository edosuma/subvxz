WEBVTT

00:00.286 --> 00:03.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yup, right here.

00:03.762 --> 00:06.897
Yup, yup, copy.

00:06.922 --> 00:08.231
We'll be ready.

00:08.256 --> 00:10.712
Okay, trauma is a minute out,

00:10.737 --> 00:13.129
including a uniformed CPD officer.

00:13.154 --> 00:16.123
I need rooms, people. Rooms, stat.

00:16.148 --> 00:18.402
Treatment 3, talk to me.
Wrapped up the frostbite.

00:18.427 --> 00:19.332
Just waiting on a discharge order.

00:19.357 --> 00:20.944
- Okay, Dr. Choi?
- Got it.

00:20.969 --> 00:22.581
But first,
guy got spooked in the ladies room.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.538
Gotta get the skin out of his zipper.

00:24.563 --> 00:25.676
All right, people.

00:25.701 --> 00:27.784
I got a waiting room full of snot,

00:27.809 --> 00:29.709
and I have traumas en rout

00:29.734 --> 00:31.087
No room for coddling, people.

00:31.112 --> 00:33.084
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:33.109 --> 00:34.545
Incoming!

00:34.570 --> 00:36.008
You're going to Trauma 1.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.934
18 year-old male, GCS
12, tachy's to 130.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.950
Suspected DUI, parked his
Beemer in someone's living room,

00:41.975 --> 00:44.304
broke the gas line, started a fire.

00:44.329 --> 00:46.295
Okay. Dr. Rhodes, you got this?

00:46.320 --> 00:47.720
- Got it.
- Thank you.

00:47.745 --> 00:49.411
- X-ray!
- Talk to me.

00:49.436 --> 00:52.370
GCS 6, BP 12O over 80,
King airway in the field.

00:52.395 --> 00:53.947
All right, Dr. Choi, Dr. Reese, now.

00:53.972 --> 00:55.204
You're going to Trauma 2.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.983
He's hypoxic. Inhaled a lot of smoke.

00:57.008 --> 00:58.261
All right, rotate.

00:58.286 --> 00:59.367
I pulled the driver, the kid,

00:59.392 --> 01:00.478
- from the wreckage.
- Yeah.

01:00.503 --> 01:02.202
My partner insisted
on clearing the house.

01:02.227 --> 01:04.694
Draw trauma labs, an ABG,
and a carboxyhemoglobin.

01:04.718 --> 01:06.333
- On my count.
- Thank you, Officer.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.105
One, two, three.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.972
- I'll take over.
- Let's start a saline line.

01:10.997 --> 01:12.553
- Let's get him set up.
- Tough to bag him.

01:12.578 --> 01:14.111
He's pretty spasmed
down. I need suction.

01:14.136 --> 01:16.136
20 of Etomidate and 100 of succs now.

01:16.148 --> 01:18.394
- We need a better airway.
- On it, prepping succs.

01:19.061 --> 01:21.228
Watch his BP. Heartrate's still tachy.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.533
Bilateral pubic rami
fractures on the X-ray.

01:23.558 --> 01:26.432
- Let's FAST him.
- Pressure's dropping.

01:30.428 --> 01:33.040
There's free fluid in his belly.

01:33.705 --> 01:35.839
Possible pelvic hematoma.

01:35.864 --> 01:37.477
All right, let's get
him up to the OR now.

01:37.502 --> 01:39.504
Start two units of rapid transfuser.

01:39.529 --> 01:40.995
- Put trauma and angio on standby.
- Mmhmm.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.562
Let's go.

01:43.765 --> 01:45.064
Oh, hold on.

01:45.089 --> 01:47.847
He's not going anywhere
till I get a DUI blood draw.

01:47.872 --> 01:49.594
- We're charging him.
- His belly is shredded.

01:49.619 --> 01:51.135
If I don't operate right now,
you're not gonna have

01:51.167 --> 01:52.112
anybody to charge...  Whoa.

01:52.137 --> 01:54.171
You already have him on IV fluids.

01:54.196 --> 01:55.685
I got ten minutes, at best,

01:55.710 --> 01:57.482
to get an accurate blood-alcohol level.

01:57.507 --> 01:59.853
You take him to the
OR, it'll be too late.

01:59.878 --> 02:01.859
The officer wants to do a draw

02:01.884 --> 02:03.859
to test your blood-alcohol content.

02:03.884 --> 02:05.261
Do I have your consent?

02:05.286 --> 02:07.253
- No.
- There's your answer.

02:07.278 --> 02:09.264
State law says I don't need consent.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.687
- Go.
- Hospital policy says you do.

02:10.725 --> 02:12.763
- You need to stop...
- Move, move. Hey, uh-uh.

02:12.788 --> 02:14.437
My partner could've died back there.

02:14.462 --> 02:15.547
You step aside.

02:15.572 --> 02:16.599
This is a hospital.

02:16.624 --> 02:18.784
Our priority is to treat patients,
not to make arrests.

02:18.809 --> 02:21.586
As soon as he's out of surgery
and awake, he's all yours.

02:21.611 --> 02:23.662
Get me that blood, or
you're under arrest.

02:23.687 --> 02:24.719
On what charge?

02:24.744 --> 02:26.585
Obstructing a police investigation.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.903
You're being ridiculous.

02:27.929 --> 02:30.657
Get me that blood.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.267
Do what you have to do.

02:36.778 --> 02:39.191
Maggie, Maggie...

02:39.216 --> 02:41.455
Take the phone.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.213
You don't have to do this.

02:43.238 --> 02:45.305
Stay back.

02:50.890 --> 02:55.143
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:58.289 --> 02:59.590
I don't know.

02:59.615 --> 03:01.359
In the moment he seemed conflicted.

03:01.384 --> 03:03.076
Conflicted about whether
his wife should live or die?

03:03.101 --> 03:05.134
He wanted you to ignore
her DNR, didn't he?

03:05.159 --> 03:06.329
It was complicated.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.842
Everything happened so fast.

03:07.867 --> 03:09.368
Dr. Halstead, we've been over this.

03:09.393 --> 03:10.744
If you say that at your deposition,

03:10.768 --> 03:11.840
Jennifer Baker's attorneys

03:11.865 --> 03:13.349
are gonna have your job
and your medical license.

03:13.374 --> 03:14.807
But that is not what happened.

03:14.832 --> 03:17.018
Look, it is my job is to
protect this hospital,

03:17.043 --> 03:18.761
and we have a strong case.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.289
Now, Jennifer Baker is enrolled
in a promising drug trial.

03:21.314 --> 03:24.216
That is not the behavior of
a woman who's ready to die.

03:24.261 --> 03:26.624
And in order to win this case,
we need to point that out.

03:26.649 --> 03:28.782
Peter, we need an approach

03:28.807 --> 03:31.612
that can both maintain
Dr. Halstead's integrity

03:31.637 --> 03:33.406
and help our case.

03:33.431 --> 03:37.104
Okay, look,

03:37.236 --> 03:39.983
if Sal Baker was as
conflicted as you've said,

03:40.240 --> 03:42.169
might one infer

03:42.194 --> 03:45.147
that at least a part of him
wanted his wife to live?

03:47.285 --> 03:49.019
Yes.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.290
[phone ringing]

03:52.952 --> 03:55.453
Just wait.

03:55.478 --> 03:57.565
Goodwin.

04:01.092 --> 04:03.093
I'm on my way.

04:04.384 --> 04:07.151
Yes, thank you.

04:08.590 --> 04:11.012
I just got off the phone
with the 21st District.

04:11.037 --> 04:12.136
They're stonewalling.

04:12.161 --> 04:13.286
They're still holding her?

04:13.311 --> 04:14.851
I can't believe that. That's outrageous.

04:14.876 --> 04:16.396
Yeah, I'm going down there.

04:16.421 --> 04:18.211
April, tag in for Maggie.

04:18.236 --> 04:19.595
Get my waiting room cleared.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.649
- Me? I got...
- I paged the on-call.

04:21.675 --> 04:22.684
She woke up this morning

04:22.709 --> 04:24.178
with the same flu as all those people

04:24.203 --> 04:25.883
in the waiting area. Don't worry.

04:25.908 --> 04:28.583
- You got this.
- Okay.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.159
Let me grab a coat and come with.

04:31.184 --> 04:32.461
We all know what happens when you

04:32.486 --> 04:34.441
back a wild animal into a corner.

04:34.466 --> 04:36.556
Maggie needs a friend, not a shrink.

04:36.581 --> 04:38.748
- I wasn't talking about Maggie.
- Well, I'm fine.

04:38.771 --> 04:40.543
I'm just going to have
a little conversation

04:40.568 --> 04:42.777
with Voight,
see if there's anything he can do.

04:42.802 --> 04:45.551
By the way, you need
to change your shirt.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.654
Coffee stain. And where's your tie?

04:48.844 --> 04:51.753
Hmm, I must've got dressed in a hurry.

04:51.778 --> 04:53.553
Good luck.

04:55.543 --> 04:57.841
Let's see. 43-year-old migraine patient,

04:57.866 --> 04:59.315
Treatment 1. Dr. Choi?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.540
- Copy that.
- All right, uh...

05:01.565 --> 05:04.194
Reese, Treatment 3, guy
got clipped by a car

05:04.219 --> 05:05.306
while crossing the street.

05:05.331 --> 05:07.382
- Aye, captain.
- Help! My baby!

05:07.407 --> 05:08.588
- Somebody help!
- Got it.

05:08.614 --> 05:10.972
[baby crying]

05:12.330 --> 05:14.310
She's been fussy and crying all morning,

05:14.335 --> 05:15.990
but every time I try to
put her down for a nap,

05:16.015 --> 05:17.315
she just...  she just wails.

05:17.481 --> 05:19.448
I'm telling you,
something's really wrong.

05:19.473 --> 05:20.722
Her color's good.

05:20.747 --> 05:22.523
She's responding to external stimuli.

05:22.548 --> 05:23.803
Who's your pediatrician?

05:23.828 --> 05:26.594
Um, uh, uh, Dr. Simon at Advocate South.

05:26.619 --> 05:27.936
All right, April,
let's get those records sent over.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.994
Copy.

05:33.992 --> 05:35.817
It's okay.

05:35.842 --> 05:38.080
All right, her ears are fine.

05:40.325 --> 05:41.901
Looks like retinal hemorrhages.

05:42.334 --> 05:43.800
Could she have hit
her head on something?

05:43.825 --> 05:45.270
No, I don't...  I don't think so.

05:45.295 --> 05:47.248
All right,
let's order a babygram and head CT.

05:47.273 --> 05:48.464
I'll let them know you're on the way.

05:48.466 --> 05:49.428
Don't worry,
I'm going to take really good care

05:49.453 --> 05:50.832
- of your baby, all right?
- Okay.

05:50.857 --> 05:52.336
Don't worry. April?

05:52.361 --> 05:54.438
[baby cries]

06:00.609 --> 06:02.577
You think I look bad?
You should've seen the car.

06:02.602 --> 06:04.535
- Ah.
- [both chuckling]

06:04.560 --> 06:06.735
Let's take a look at that leg.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.583
I was rushing to my 11:00.

06:08.608 --> 06:10.864
On my cell phone,
which I know is a horrible idea.

06:11.221 --> 06:13.621
Didn't even look before
crossing the street.

06:13.646 --> 06:15.521
I mean, it's totally my bad.

06:15.624 --> 06:17.059
But still, whatever
happened to pedestrians

06:17.084 --> 06:18.438
having the right of way?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.796
Mm, that's why I take the bus.

06:21.161 --> 06:22.594
Does it hurt when I press here?

06:22.619 --> 06:24.342
No, not much.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.981
You don't get extra points for
tolerating pain, Mr. Dietrich.

06:28.249 --> 06:30.513
It's not bad. It just clipped me

06:30.538 --> 06:32.458
as I was jumping out of the way, really.

06:32.483 --> 06:35.017
Well, good news is,
it doesn't appear to be broken.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.442
But there is fluid on your knee.

06:36.444 --> 06:38.143
I think we should have
ortho take a look.

06:38.145 --> 06:40.048
Is that really necessary?

06:40.381 --> 06:43.235
I've got to file an emergency
motion before lunch.

06:43.373 --> 06:45.356
I understand, but we can't release you

06:45.381 --> 06:46.469
without a complete workup.

06:46.494 --> 06:47.526
I'll tell you what.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.065
I play tennis with Bernie Goldstein,

06:49.090 --> 06:50.656
Chief of Orthopedics
over at Northwestern.

06:50.687 --> 06:53.592
If you can just brace my leg
and get me on some crutches,

06:53.618 --> 06:54.884
I guarantee he'll get me in

06:54.909 --> 06:56.843
for an office visit first
thing tomorrow morning.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.279
Make your appointment.
I'll check with my attending.

07:01.304 --> 07:03.137
- Great.
- Thanks.

[exhales]

07:31.160 --> 07:33.391
Hi.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.245
I-I can wait for the next one.

07:53.923 --> 07:58.060
Sorry,
just needed to go out for a quick smoke.

07:59.828 --> 08:02.650
That's not the first
time I've got that look.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.256
Don't worry,
I didn't smoke when I was pregnant.

08:08.344 --> 08:10.183
Well, you know,
there is also secondhand smoke...

08:10.208 --> 08:11.958
Yeah, or around the baby.

08:11.983 --> 08:13.619
Okay.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.063
I'm sorry. Sorry.

08:18.088 --> 08:21.700
It's just, uh...  It's just the stress.

08:21.725 --> 08:25.664
It's been really tough
these last few months.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.587
Is there anyone you'd like to call?

08:29.612 --> 08:30.806
Maybe Grace's father, or...

08:30.831 --> 08:32.703
I wouldn't know who to call.

08:33.303 --> 08:35.874
You don't know who the father is?

08:37.659 --> 08:39.692
It's not so much a matter of who.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.746
It's more which.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.996
There were a couple guys.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.123
But you know, it doesn't even matter,

08:45.148 --> 08:47.118
because they all bailed when
I told them I was pregnant,

08:47.143 --> 08:50.990
so... and then my parents,
they thought I should terminate.

08:51.472 --> 08:54.723
'Cause, you know, "A
baby needs a father."

08:55.181 --> 08:59.450
But no, no, I just...  I couldn't.

09:01.153 --> 09:03.150
So here we are...

09:04.627 --> 09:06.685
The two of us,

09:07.363 --> 09:10.197
just doing the best we can.

09:18.352 --> 09:20.653
Chicago Med has a strict policy

09:20.678 --> 09:22.637
against forcible blood draws.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.820
I got that.

09:23.966 --> 09:26.574
Maggie might've been
following hospital procedure,

09:26.823 --> 09:28.656
but from patrol's point of view,

09:28.681 --> 09:31.415
she obstructed a
time-sensitive investigation.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.799
And if we had delayed that operation,

09:33.824 --> 09:36.118
we could have put that
boy's life in jeopardy.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.853
Did you come here to
argue or ask a favor?

09:39.486 --> 09:42.257
Listen, Windham told me

09:42.282 --> 09:45.584
that kid was doing close
to 80 in a 25 zone.

09:45.609 --> 09:47.252
And that house he hit...

09:47.277 --> 09:49.417
There was a family inside.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.097
If they can't get DUI charges to stick,

09:52.122 --> 09:53.728
that kid is gonna post

09:53.753 --> 09:56.435
and be back behind the
wheel in a couple of days.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.158
They're not happy.

09:58.183 --> 09:59.599
And you think I'm happy

09:59.624 --> 10:01.658
that one of my people
is sitting behind bars?

10:01.692 --> 10:03.368
Sharon, you overestimate my pull.

10:03.393 --> 10:05.677
Hank, it's Maggie that's in there.

10:05.918 --> 10:08.106
And I'm asking you as a friend,

10:08.131 --> 10:10.075
find a way to get her out.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.418
Look, they're not gonna release her

10:11.443 --> 10:13.756
until after she's been
processed and arraigned.

10:13.948 --> 10:16.647
I'll see if I can have her
moved up on the docket,

10:16.672 --> 10:20.124
but other than that,
there's nothing I can do.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.292
Can I at least see her?

10:25.008 --> 10:27.571
[indistinct chatter]

10:30.937 --> 10:34.586
- Maggie?
- Sharon.

10:36.016 --> 10:38.576
Girl, I am so sorry.

10:38.601 --> 10:41.172
Hey, you got five minutes.

10:41.381 --> 10:43.681
So I guess you're not
here to take me home.

10:43.706 --> 10:44.622
Not yet.

10:44.647 --> 10:48.249
Voight said they can't release
you until you've been arraigned.

10:48.274 --> 10:49.807
They're actually gonna
charge me for this?

10:49.832 --> 10:51.707
Kalmick's got the gloves off.

10:51.732 --> 10:53.144
We've got a good chance

10:53.169 --> 10:56.003
of getting the charges
dropped or at least reduced.

10:56.038 --> 10:57.404
Hell, I was doing my job.

10:57.429 --> 11:01.104
You handled the situation
exactly as I would've.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.354
That blood draw would've
left the hospital

11:03.379 --> 11:04.774
open for litigation.

11:04.799 --> 11:05.965
Yeah, yeah.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.114
Next time to fill out
a credit application,

11:08.139 --> 11:09.518
that's what I'll tell
them when they ask me,

11:09.543 --> 11:11.029
"Have you ever been arrested?"

11:11.054 --> 11:14.382
Maggie, we're gonna
get you through this.

11:14.890 --> 11:18.780
- You better.
- Okay.

11:22.729 --> 11:24.489
- Dr. Manning.
- Yeah?

11:24.514 --> 11:26.522
- A word.
- Sure.

11:36.050 --> 11:37.949
Not only retinal hemorrhages,

11:37.974 --> 11:41.958
but we found a subdural
hematoma and cerebral edema.

11:43.357 --> 11:45.759
The classic diagnostic triad.

11:45.784 --> 11:48.033
This is a case of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

11:48.163 --> 11:50.430
Is there any other caregiver
in the baby's life?

11:50.455 --> 11:52.375
A nanny, her father?

11:52.493 --> 11:54.695
Nope.

11:55.325 --> 11:57.470
She did this.

12:06.006 --> 12:07.679
And Dr. Grant agrees

12:07.704 --> 12:10.918
with your diagnosis of
Shaken Baby Syndrome?

12:10.943 --> 12:12.075
She does.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.306
We both reviewed Grace's CT scans.

12:14.331 --> 12:15.915
The findings are consistent

12:15.940 --> 12:18.672
with the neuropathological triad of SBS.

12:18.697 --> 12:19.895
And you're certain there couldn't be

12:19.920 --> 12:22.591
any other explanation for the symptoms?

12:22.733 --> 12:26.301
I cannot draw any other conclusion here

12:26.326 --> 12:28.026
other than child abuse.

12:29.872 --> 12:31.540
[sighs]

12:31.618 --> 12:36.955
Dr. Manning, once I pick up
that phone and notify DCFS,

12:36.980 --> 12:39.389
it's out of our hands.

12:40.041 --> 12:45.029
A mother intentionally harmed her child.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.471
I think it's the right call to make.

12:52.592 --> 12:55.110
Hey, how'd the surgery
with the DUI kid go?

12:55.135 --> 12:56.512
There was a pretty large laceration

12:56.537 --> 12:58.581
at the dome of the bladder,
so it took a while to repair.

12:58.606 --> 13:01.702
Uh, where's Maggie? I was wondering

13:01.727 --> 13:03.419
if she got ahold of
the kid's parents yet.

13:03.444 --> 13:04.586
You didn't hear?

13:04.611 --> 13:05.809
Maggie got arrested.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.137
- She what?
- Yeah,

13:07.162 --> 13:08.868
after we took the kid upstairs,
they couldn't get the blood

13:08.893 --> 13:10.957
and charged her with obstruction.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.456
I know.

13:12.481 --> 13:15.199
Goodwin's working on
getting her cut loose.

13:16.708 --> 13:20.210
Ms. Reese, beautiful day, right?

13:20.291 --> 13:22.089
I guess, it's kinda cold.

13:22.114 --> 13:24.345
Hey, hey, is that for
the gentleman in 3?

13:24.370 --> 13:26.304
- Yeah, Kevin Dietrich.
- You know what?

13:26.319 --> 13:29.330
Those buckles are actually a
lot trickier than they look.

13:29.355 --> 13:31.288
How about if I give you a little hand?

13:32.928 --> 13:34.696
Okay, sure.

13:38.293 --> 13:40.936
Mr. Dietrich, I'm Dr. Charles.

13:40.961 --> 13:42.286
Hey.

13:42.649 --> 13:44.315
- How are you?
- Good, good.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.736
I have come to render an assist

13:47.761 --> 13:49.679
with this deceptively tricky brace.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.537
Sure.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.680
[chuckles] Chief of Psychiatry?

13:57.705 --> 13:59.248
Technically, yeah.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.545
Today, more like Chief
of Physical Therapy.

14:01.570 --> 14:04.656
I blew out my knee out on the
slopes a couple years ago,

14:04.681 --> 14:07.573
got stuck with one of these
suckers for a few months.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.489
- The trick is the buckles.
- Okay.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.714
Great, good to know. Thank you.

14:14.264 --> 14:17.290
So, uh, how'd you do this?

14:17.315 --> 14:19.760
Oh, just one of those mornings,

14:19.785 --> 14:21.070
completely overbooked.

14:21.335 --> 14:22.636
Point is, I was running late...

14:22.661 --> 14:23.804
And on your cell phone.

14:23.844 --> 14:26.550
Right, I was on the phone
with my insurance broker...

14:26.575 --> 14:27.785
Need to up our homeowner's.

14:27.810 --> 14:30.176
Anyway, so I stepped
out into the crossing,

14:30.222 --> 14:32.636
tried to jump out of
the way but couldn't.

14:32.661 --> 14:35.937
So, boom, I'm on the ground. [chuckles]

14:36.562 --> 14:39.031
Wow, hell of a morning.

14:39.056 --> 14:43.047
Yeah, well, I'm just thankful
for the intrepid Ms. Reese here

14:43.049 --> 14:45.044
for patching me up so I
can get on with my day.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.448
You know, you can't
really drive like this.

14:47.473 --> 14:49.221
So what...  should we call your wife?

14:49.246 --> 14:51.884
No, no, the...

14:53.285 --> 14:55.307
- I just mean she's really busy.
- Ah.

14:55.332 --> 14:57.425
Billed nearly 80 hours last week.

14:57.450 --> 14:59.909
So I don't want to bother
her with something like this.

15:00.923 --> 15:03.943
Great. Nice to meet ya.

15:03.968 --> 15:06.185
Yeah, a pleasure. Thank you.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.573
Ms. Reese, could I
just see you for a sec?

15:08.598 --> 15:10.598
[mouthing]

15:12.328 --> 15:14.400
Could you do me a favor
and give me a heads up

15:14.425 --> 15:16.514
before you discharge Mr. Dietrich?

15:16.645 --> 15:19.543
- Okay.
- Thank you.

15:22.075 --> 15:24.977
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

15:25.002 --> 15:26.502
Okay, good.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.439
All right,
we'll get her back as soon as possible.

15:28.464 --> 15:30.467
You're Mommy's doctor.

15:30.492 --> 15:31.955
You saved her.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.220
Hi, Bailey.

15:33.245 --> 15:35.101
What are you doing down here?

15:35.126 --> 15:36.810
I need more markers.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.762
Do your parents know where you are?

15:38.787 --> 15:40.420
Uh-uh.

15:40.798 --> 15:42.720
I'm sorry, we can't have that.

15:42.745 --> 15:44.345
Come with me.

15:45.601 --> 15:47.524
Hey, Leah,

15:47.760 --> 15:49.538
can you take Bailey back upstairs

15:49.563 --> 15:50.663
to the clinical trial wing?

15:50.688 --> 15:53.205
I can't leave the desk,
but I will find someone who can.

15:53.230 --> 15:54.963
Okay, thanks.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.420
I need more colors for my rainbow.

15:57.508 --> 16:00.375
Wow, that's very pretty.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.546
I'm making it for Mommy,
to make her feel better.

16:05.319 --> 16:07.119
Has she been sick?

16:07.144 --> 16:09.111
Real sick.

16:11.063 --> 16:13.431
Did something happen, Bailey?

16:13.456 --> 16:16.182
She had to get a shot.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.657
Okay.

16:24.261 --> 16:27.096
Dr. Manning, DCFS just arrived.

16:31.182 --> 16:34.793
Ms. Fisher, this is Madeline Gastern

16:34.818 --> 16:37.537
from the Department of
Child and Family Services.

16:37.562 --> 16:41.033
I'm here to investigate a
possible case of child abuse.

16:41.058 --> 16:43.913
Child abuse? What, you
think I hurt my baby?

16:43.938 --> 16:46.081
- That's crazy.
- We need you to come with us.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.458
What? No!
No, no, I don't want to leave my baby.

16:48.483 --> 16:50.339
No, you can't do this!
I didn't hurt her!

16:50.364 --> 16:52.167
You can't make me leave my baby!

16:52.192 --> 16:54.079
I didn't hurt her! You can't do this!

16:54.104 --> 16:55.600
I didn't hurt her!

16:55.625 --> 16:58.468
You can't make me leave my baby!

16:58.953 --> 17:00.819
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:00.844 --> 17:04.311
Ah, Dr. Charles, good
news. I'm out of here.

17:04.337 --> 17:07.339
Before you go,
could I just talk to you for a sec?

17:07.365 --> 17:08.993
- Um...
- Ms. Reese,

17:09.019 --> 17:11.505
do you mind excusing us for...
for just a moment?

17:11.530 --> 17:12.963
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.531
Yeah, I really have to go.

17:14.556 --> 17:16.883
I will not keep you
for more than a minute.

17:16.907 --> 17:19.407
I just want to understand
a little better

17:19.433 --> 17:21.152
what happened this morning.

17:21.435 --> 17:22.839
I already explained. It was an accident.

17:22.865 --> 17:24.265
And I'm sorry, but I'm really late.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.598
I understand. You're a very busy man.

17:25.624 --> 17:28.989
Listen, off-the-wall question.

17:30.435 --> 17:34.067
Have you been...  having a hard time

17:34.092 --> 17:36.483
getting out of bed in
the morning recently?

17:37.159 --> 17:39.760
No. I have to go.

17:39.785 --> 17:42.612
- Thanks.
- Mr. Dietrich.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.884
- Excuse me.
- [clears throat]

17:46.909 --> 17:48.822
Mr. Dietrich, I'm sorry.

17:48.824 --> 17:50.689
I can't let you leave just yet.

17:50.714 --> 17:52.547
What are you talking about?

17:56.810 --> 17:59.222
I am not convinced
that it was an accident

17:59.247 --> 18:01.669
when you stepped in front
of that car this morning.

18:01.694 --> 18:03.530
I think you were trying
to kill yourself.

18:03.555 --> 18:06.564
- [laughs] What?
- Dr. Charles.

18:06.589 --> 18:08.151
And I'm, um...  I'm worried

18:08.192 --> 18:11.092
that you still might be a suicide risk.

18:11.117 --> 18:13.183
- And if you insist on leaving...
- I do.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.296
I'm going to have to place you

18:14.321 --> 18:16.159
under a temporary psychiatric hold.

18:16.184 --> 18:19.009
[scoffs] This is ridiculous.

18:19.314 --> 18:21.685
Well, Earl here is going to
take you someplace quiet.

18:21.710 --> 18:23.676
- I...
- And hopefully we can talk.

18:23.701 --> 18:25.806
I will sue you and this entire hospital.

18:25.831 --> 18:26.845
Thank you, Earl.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.270
I'll have your medical license.

18:28.295 --> 18:29.436
You can't...  You can't do this.

18:29.461 --> 18:32.470
- I can, actually.
- What?

18:41.279 --> 18:43.314
Back to work.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.958
I've got a charge
nurse in city hospital,

18:50.983 --> 18:53.071
an ongoing child-abuse investigation,

18:53.096 --> 18:54.706
and now you bring me this?

18:54.731 --> 18:56.764
He tried to commit suicide, Sharon.

18:56.789 --> 18:58.296
I wasn't about to let it happen again.

18:58.321 --> 18:59.587
He's a successful lawyer

18:59.612 --> 19:01.806
with no past history of depression.

19:01.831 --> 19:04.298
I know the type, okay?

19:04.422 --> 19:06.822
Look, the way he
recounted what happened,

19:06.852 --> 19:09.730
his need to sell this
way too-detailed version

19:09.755 --> 19:11.633
of the narrative, right?

19:11.658 --> 19:13.291
Look at this X-ray.

19:13.403 --> 19:17.471
He took the impact directly
above the knee... directly.

19:17.496 --> 19:20.320
That means he stood
in and took the brunt.

19:20.345 --> 19:21.843
He wanted to get hit.

19:22.139 --> 19:24.038
That's conjecture, Daniel.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.344
You're usually not this
quick to make a diagnosis.

19:27.369 --> 19:29.750
With this condition,
you become a master of disguise.

19:29.775 --> 19:31.482
Just give me a little more time

19:31.507 --> 19:33.273
to see if I can get him to
drop the mask, okay? Okay.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.184
All right. Just find a way to do it

19:35.209 --> 19:37.717
without further complicating my life.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.711
Is there something else?

19:47.583 --> 19:50.454
I'll sure be glad when Maggie gets back.

19:50.893 --> 19:52.191
Check your e-mail.

19:52.216 --> 19:53.827
Advocate just sent over
those medical files

19:53.852 --> 19:55.272
you requested on baby Grace.

19:55.297 --> 19:56.763
- Oh, right.
- And I'm sorry it took so long.

19:56.788 --> 19:58.394
They're just as backed
up as we are today.

19:58.419 --> 20:00.619
Sure.

20:20.718 --> 20:24.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:25.811 --> 20:29.609
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Yeah, you are.

20:29.634 --> 20:30.912
Surgery went well.

20:30.937 --> 20:32.648
Like, totally okay?

20:32.848 --> 20:35.649
I want to be a pilot...  Naval aviator.

20:35.721 --> 20:37.760
Do you realize what you did today?

20:37.785 --> 20:38.929
Hmm?

20:38.954 --> 20:41.463
- Yeah, yeah, it was stupid.
- Trev, you're awake.

20:41.488 --> 20:42.917
Hey, Dad.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.597
Did you say anything to
the police at the scene?

20:45.622 --> 20:47.322
- No.
- Attaboy.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.914
He did the right thing,
refusing the blood draw.

20:50.039 --> 20:51.644
Just talked to Sid Burstyn.

20:51.669 --> 20:54.471
He thinks he might be able
to make this all go away.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.161
- Great.
- No one got seriously hurt,

20:56.186 --> 20:59.894
so it looks like we can all just
move on, put this behind us.

20:59.919 --> 21:01.538
Somebody got hurt.

21:02.319 --> 21:05.919
You must be Dr. Rhodes.
Thank you for everything.

21:10.807 --> 21:12.584
We'll do a cystogram next week

21:12.609 --> 21:14.241
to see how your bladder's healing.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.422
You can schedule it with radiology.

21:16.447 --> 21:18.506
If you'll excuse me.

21:24.279 --> 21:26.588
God, I wanted to pop that guy.

21:26.612 --> 21:27.808
He's just like my dad,

21:27.833 --> 21:30.707
that same stupid sense of entitlement.

21:31.116 --> 21:33.780
My DUI kid, he's ruined.

21:34.971 --> 21:36.947
Connor, look, we don't get along.

21:36.972 --> 21:39.558
You don't like me. But I need a favor,

21:39.583 --> 21:41.283
and there's no one else I can ask.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.590
I have to access some records,

21:45.615 --> 21:47.470
and I can't use my code to log in.

21:47.495 --> 21:49.061
Why not?

21:50.360 --> 21:52.928
Because no one can
know I looked at them.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.892
You caught me on the right day.

22:01.142 --> 22:02.609
It's my DNR patient, Jennifer Baker...

22:02.634 --> 22:06.380
Don't tell me;
I don't want to know anything about it.

22:07.245 --> 22:09.919
[typing]

22:22.304 --> 22:25.907
I realize this is a very
uncomfortable situation, really.

22:25.932 --> 22:27.266
Do you?

22:27.957 --> 22:30.124
I don't have to talk to you.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.224
Of course not.

22:33.903 --> 22:36.368
I hope you will.

22:36.987 --> 22:38.720
What does it matter?

22:38.745 --> 22:41.642
I could tell you that I'm a happy man,

22:41.667 --> 22:43.867
that I have a perfect life, which I do.

22:43.892 --> 22:45.825
But you've already got
your mind made up about me.

22:45.850 --> 22:47.183
Mr. Dietrich,

22:47.208 --> 22:49.697
I don't have my mind
made up about anything.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.572
I am genuinely here to help.

22:51.597 --> 22:53.190
- Help?
- Yeah.

22:53.821 --> 22:58.053
No, this is how you justify yourself.

22:58.078 --> 22:59.878
Look at you.

22:59.903 --> 23:04.118
So smug, so sure of yourself,
like you know me.

23:04.143 --> 23:05.756
You don't know me.

23:06.025 --> 23:08.259
So go ahead, tell me what my problem is.

23:10.415 --> 23:11.967
Tell you what your problem is?

23:11.992 --> 23:13.459
Yeah, come on.

23:13.484 --> 23:15.513
Enlighten me, Dr. Freud.

23:15.806 --> 23:17.105
It doesn't really work that way.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.396
Okay, wow.

23:18.421 --> 23:20.157
So you don't know, do you?

23:20.443 --> 23:23.333
This is your job, and
you don't have a clue.

23:23.475 --> 23:26.910
So you've got all those
people fooled out there, huh?

23:29.719 --> 23:32.721
You know what? Um, I think we are

23:32.746 --> 23:34.179
hitting a bit of a wall, so...

23:34.204 --> 23:36.387
Yeah, you know why?
'Cause I shouldn't be here

23:36.412 --> 23:38.031
in the first place.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.072
I'll check in on you later.

23:40.097 --> 23:42.703
Okay, yup,

23:42.728 --> 23:45.496
hope you've got your
malpractice premiums paid up.

23:55.543 --> 23:57.745
Dr. Charles,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.385
has he admitted he
tried to kill himself?

24:00.425 --> 24:04.916
No, he says he's a happy man

24:04.941 --> 24:07.702
and has a perfect life.

24:09.805 --> 24:13.216
So what are you going to do?

24:13.241 --> 24:16.408
[sighs]

24:20.881 --> 24:22.748
I don't know.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.772
Great.

24:28.797 --> 24:30.679
Thanks for letting me know, Hank.

24:30.704 --> 24:32.130
[knock at door] Come in.

24:32.155 --> 24:33.902
Tell her I'm on my way.

24:34.025 --> 24:37.359
Dr. Rhodes, I hope you
can make this quick.

24:37.384 --> 24:39.139
I was the one that kept the cops

24:39.164 --> 24:41.376
from drawing that kid's
blood, not Maggie.

24:41.401 --> 24:43.253
If anybody should be held responsible,
it's me.

24:43.278 --> 24:45.051
And I'm gonna go turn myself in.

24:45.076 --> 24:47.447
That's a nice gesture,
but things don't work that way.

24:47.472 --> 24:49.267
Besides, Maggie just made bail.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.523
I'm going to pick her up now.

24:50.548 --> 24:51.449
- Ms. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

24:51.474 --> 24:53.675
These are baby Grace's
records from Advocate South.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.629
I made a horrible mistake.

24:55.654 --> 24:58.088
We have to stop DCFS.

24:59.194 --> 25:01.462
I'll go get Maggie.

25:02.036 --> 25:04.310
Talk to me.

25:08.229 --> 25:11.037
So if it's not Shaken Baby Syndrome...

25:11.062 --> 25:12.766
Grace suffered an injury in utero...

25:12.791 --> 25:14.048
An intracranial hemorrhage,

25:14.073 --> 25:15.557
which I believe occurred
when her mother was

25:15.582 --> 25:17.719
in a car accident at 30 weeks gestation.

25:17.744 --> 25:20.823
And this happened before
the baby was even born?

25:20.848 --> 25:22.342
Yes, when her prenatal ultrasounds

25:22.367 --> 25:24.005
were sent over from Advocate South,

25:24.030 --> 25:26.282
I showed them to Dr. Heller,
head of radiology.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.587
There's a small hematoma on the images.

25:28.618 --> 25:30.802
It's easy to miss, but it is there.

25:30.827 --> 25:33.936
But wouldn't the doctors
have noticed it at birth?

25:33.961 --> 25:35.594
It likely healed soon
after the accident,

25:35.619 --> 25:36.865
and was asymptomatic.

25:36.890 --> 25:39.000
But even the slightest bump on the head

25:39.025 --> 25:41.376
or a roll in her crib could
have caused her to re-bleed.

25:41.401 --> 25:43.401
And mimic the SBS triad.

25:43.426 --> 25:45.259
- Yes.
- Let's go.

25:47.488 --> 25:49.631
[knock at door]

25:52.820 --> 25:55.184
[knocking]

25:55.554 --> 25:57.420
[door opens]

26:00.301 --> 26:02.369
Dr. Charles?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.986
Yeah?

26:04.029 --> 26:05.660
I'm sorry, but I texted you

26:05.685 --> 26:07.351
and didn't get an answer.

26:07.376 --> 26:09.214
What is it, Ms. Reese?

26:10.057 --> 26:13.552
Um, have you been back
to see Mr. Dietrich?

26:14.370 --> 26:15.870
No, I haven't.

26:15.895 --> 26:17.728
Oh.

26:35.144 --> 26:38.963
Dr. Charles, this isn't like you.

26:39.672 --> 26:43.030
I mean, you never give up,

26:44.161 --> 26:45.968
and you always know what to say.

26:45.993 --> 26:48.727
That's why we all admire you so much.

26:50.084 --> 26:51.951
Ms. Reese,

26:54.729 --> 26:56.809
did it occur to you that you might be

26:56.985 --> 26:58.808
overstepping the bounds

26:58.833 --> 27:01.266
of a fourth-year medical student?

27:06.943 --> 27:08.810
I'm sorry.

27:18.486 --> 27:20.544
[sighs]

27:30.650 --> 27:32.137
I told you I didn't hurt her.

27:32.162 --> 27:34.181
I know. I am very sorry.

27:34.206 --> 27:35.439
We all are.

27:35.464 --> 27:36.835
You people are horrible.

27:36.942 --> 27:38.442
Ms. Fisher, please understand,

27:38.467 --> 27:40.973
we were following hospital protocol.

27:40.998 --> 27:43.332
Whenever there's a case
of suspected abuse,

27:43.357 --> 27:45.068
we have to take it seriously.

27:45.093 --> 27:47.927
You started judging me the
second I walked in here.

27:51.752 --> 27:54.282
So does this mean my Gracie ain't sick?

27:54.589 --> 27:56.821
No, I'm sorry,

27:56.846 --> 27:58.765
but, symptomatically,
your child is still

27:58.790 --> 28:01.091
in the same condition.

28:02.217 --> 28:03.782
We can't be certain

28:03.807 --> 28:06.080
how her development might be affected.

28:06.105 --> 28:07.930
We'd like to keep her
here for monitoring...

28:07.955 --> 28:11.520
No, no, no, no,
I don't want you or anybody else

28:11.545 --> 28:13.288
at this hospital taking care of my baby.

28:13.313 --> 28:14.492
How soon can I get her out of here?

28:14.518 --> 28:15.891
We'll check with Dr. Grant

28:15.916 --> 28:17.614
to see when she can be discharged.

28:17.639 --> 28:19.238
I want to go see her now.

28:19.263 --> 28:20.913
Of course.

28:33.915 --> 28:36.033
Mr. Dietrich, how you doing?

28:40.506 --> 28:42.137
You know what? I am gonna tell you

28:42.162 --> 28:44.789
why I think you threw
yourself in front of that car.

28:45.456 --> 28:49.445
It's precisely because
you think you have

28:49.470 --> 28:52.508
the perfect life,
and you're still miserable.

28:52.533 --> 28:54.334
So, what, I'm an ingrate?

28:54.359 --> 28:56.980
No, it's called endogenous depression,

28:57.005 --> 28:59.492
and it's caused by your brain chemistry.

28:59.744 --> 29:02.845
And like so many people
who suffer from depression,

29:02.870 --> 29:04.544
you're ashamed to tell anybody about it,

29:04.569 --> 29:06.409
'cause you think it's your fault.

29:06.983 --> 29:08.729
[laughs]

29:08.917 --> 29:12.185
Okay, yeah, I'm...  I bet. Sure, sure.

29:12.210 --> 29:15.317
Okay, look, why don't
you call your wife?

29:16.091 --> 29:18.625
Tell her where you are
and why you're here.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.117
She's an attorney; she can get
you out of here in five minutes.

29:21.142 --> 29:22.588
She knows what to do.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.890
What, you don't want to...  What...

29:27.915 --> 29:31.675
You don't want to call her?

29:32.963 --> 29:37.034
Why? Are you worried that
maybe, if she finds out

29:37.059 --> 29:38.988
that you're not the brave,
strong man she married,

29:39.013 --> 29:41.990
she might not love you anymore?

29:42.455 --> 29:44.406
Do you know that the
single greatest challenge

29:44.431 --> 29:47.878
that I face is trying to convince people

29:47.903 --> 29:49.680
that depression isn't
a sign of weakness?

29:49.705 --> 29:52.039
Okay, I'll remember that
if I'm ever depressed.

29:52.477 --> 29:55.734
- Okay.
- [taps the bed]

29:56.122 --> 29:57.864
You know, I got to hand it to you.

29:57.889 --> 30:01.906
You are... you're one
hell of a performer.

30:02.115 --> 30:04.820
I mean, a real trouper.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.945
I mean, keeping it up for so long.

30:11.899 --> 30:15.268
You know, selling this idea of
who you think you need to be,

30:15.293 --> 30:17.808
all the time...

30:21.894 --> 30:27.336
Carrying around the weight of that...
performance.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.894
Isn't it tiring?

30:34.457 --> 30:37.902
Aren't you exhausted?

30:37.927 --> 30:40.584
I think it'd be exhausting.

30:44.618 --> 30:49.080
[soft laugh]

30:49.597 --> 30:52.588
I have absolutely no excuse to be sad.

30:53.123 --> 30:54.938
You don't need an excuse, man.

30:54.963 --> 30:56.544
You're a human being.

30:57.275 --> 30:59.657
[scoffs]

30:59.682 --> 31:02.716
[crying]

31:10.477 --> 31:14.480
[sniffles] [cries]

31:14.505 --> 31:17.072
You're, um...

31:17.969 --> 31:20.745
You're not alone, Mr. Dietrich.

31:21.350 --> 31:24.188
[exhales]

31:36.590 --> 31:38.336
So what's the story?

31:38.361 --> 31:41.459
Sharon didn't need to send a
trauma surgeon to pick me up.

31:41.484 --> 31:44.837
I wanted to do it. I felt bad.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.141
Why, 'cause I'm the one who got busted?

31:47.663 --> 31:49.830
Mm.

31:50.223 --> 31:53.058
Listen, I know you think that,
because you're a trauma surgeon,

31:53.083 --> 31:54.345
you're the boss.

31:54.461 --> 31:57.569
But the ED's mine,
and nothing happens in my kingdom

31:57.594 --> 31:59.168
that I don't take responsibility for.

31:59.193 --> 32:00.849
You're right, you're right.

32:00.874 --> 32:04.876
Maybe...  the system's rigged...

32:05.543 --> 32:08.138
and it pisses me off.

32:13.785 --> 32:15.933
Pisses you off?

32:21.887 --> 32:24.376
I have sat in jail.

32:27.494 --> 32:31.326
My buddy and I...
Summer before I went to college,

32:32.058 --> 32:34.258
we got busted trying to buy drugs

32:34.283 --> 32:36.322
off of an undercover cop.

32:36.865 --> 32:40.486
- You?
- Yeah.

32:42.563 --> 32:44.260
I mean, come on, at that age,

32:44.285 --> 32:46.616
you think you're invincible, right?

32:47.724 --> 32:49.557
Turns out,

32:49.741 --> 32:51.808
only one of us was right.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.836
My dad pulled some strings,

32:53.861 --> 32:57.873
and he got me off.

32:59.343 --> 33:01.600
What about your friend?

33:03.323 --> 33:07.819
Well, his dad didn't
own a department store.

33:09.803 --> 33:12.784
Turns out the lifeboat
was only big enough

33:12.809 --> 33:15.378
for one of us, so I had a choice.

33:15.403 --> 33:17.901
I could stand by my friend,

33:19.129 --> 33:21.298
or I could jump in.

33:25.569 --> 33:27.913
So I jumped in the boat.

33:36.086 --> 33:39.748
I'm honored that you
would share this with me,

33:40.109 --> 33:44.198
but if you want to make amends,
you need to call your friend.

33:46.089 --> 33:48.157
I can't.

33:50.379 --> 33:54.208
He died of an overdose
before I could...

33:54.536 --> 33:57.540
Before I could work up the nerve.

34:08.469 --> 34:12.215
- Zoe...
- Hey.

34:12.239 --> 34:15.076
Jennifer Baker had a pulmonary
embolism four days ago.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.328
- How'd you hear that?
- I saw her chart.

34:18.592 --> 34:20.317
Will, the woman is suing you.

34:20.342 --> 34:22.143
If you accessed those
records, they'll know.

34:22.168 --> 34:25.583
- Someone did it for me.
- Dr. Manning?

34:25.608 --> 34:27.641
No. That's not important.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.876
The records show that her
doctors prescribed heparin

34:29.900 --> 34:31.263
to dissolve the clot.

34:31.288 --> 34:32.050
So?

34:32.074 --> 34:33.474
Heparin is contraindicated

34:33.498 --> 34:35.719
for use with the medication
being used in her drug trial.

34:35.745 --> 34:37.945
That means Jennifer's
not on the medication.

34:37.969 --> 34:39.476
She's on the placebo.

34:39.561 --> 34:42.053
Oh, Will, I'm so sorry.

34:42.078 --> 34:43.360
She's going to die if we don't get

34:43.386 --> 34:44.697
her switched over to the active drug.

34:44.723 --> 34:46.603
Is there anything you can
do to make that happen?

34:46.628 --> 34:48.255
What?

34:48.281 --> 34:50.275
You know the oncologist
running the trial, right?

34:50.301 --> 34:51.500
Maybe you can petition.

34:51.525 --> 34:52.757
I-I-I can't.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.246
It would compromise the whole trial.

34:54.271 --> 34:55.971
All right, then we'll do
something without him knowing.

34:55.996 --> 34:57.262
Like back-date a scan.

34:57.287 --> 34:59.733
No, Will, please. God.

34:59.758 --> 35:03.038
Listen, I am asking you for this...
for this one thing,

35:03.063 --> 35:06.133
for me...  To let this go.

35:08.014 --> 35:09.687
I'm sorry.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.436
I can't.

35:15.944 --> 35:18.934
[sighs]

35:19.945 --> 35:21.542
What's wrong with her?

35:21.567 --> 35:23.028
- What's going on?
- She's seizing.

35:23.053 --> 35:25.235
What's wrong? Please, help her!

35:25.260 --> 35:26.938
Get the crash cart and page Dr. Grant.

35:26.963 --> 35:28.797
- What's her Broselow?
- She's pink on the tape.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.677
Push .7 milligrams of Lorazepam.

35:30.702 --> 35:32.719
- .7, I got it.
- All right, sats are 66.

35:32.744 --> 35:33.652
Start bagging her.

35:33.677 --> 35:35.978
What's wrong with her? What's going on?

35:36.003 --> 35:38.037
She's stopped breathing.

35:39.545 --> 35:41.189
[sobs]

35:41.214 --> 35:44.062
- Sats are coming up.
- Is she breathing?

35:44.087 --> 35:46.129
She's postictal and
protecting her airway.

35:46.154 --> 35:48.922
Let's get another head CT
and page pediatric neurology.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.634
This is what you were
talking about, huh?

35:50.659 --> 35:54.015
Yes,
seizures can be a part of her condition.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.589
How long will she have 'em?

35:55.614 --> 35:59.539
- I don't know.
- Her whole life?

35:59.564 --> 36:01.479
I don't know.

36:01.504 --> 36:05.768
[baby crying]

36:12.552 --> 36:14.756
That woman has a long road ahead of her.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.161
They both do.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.181
You know,
there are maybe 17 different agencies

36:20.206 --> 36:23.190
ready to jump in when
they suspect abuse.

36:23.547 --> 36:25.129
But who jumps in to help

36:25.154 --> 36:27.883
when it's a single
mother who's struggling?

36:29.141 --> 36:31.043
You know, she's right.

36:31.068 --> 36:32.725
I did judge her.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.130
And you know why?

36:35.155 --> 36:37.326
Because I can imagine it.

36:37.598 --> 36:40.758
Owen is bawling his head off

36:40.783 --> 36:42.369
at 3:00 in the morning.

36:42.394 --> 36:44.928
And I am exhausted,

36:44.953 --> 36:47.224
and I have no one I can hand him to.

36:47.250 --> 36:51.502
So yeah, I can imagine it.

36:51.526 --> 36:53.937
And there isn't a
mother alive who hasn't.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.459
The difference is, you won't do it.

36:56.568 --> 36:58.849
And neither did she.

37:11.024 --> 37:14.423
- It's Maggie.
- Look who's back.

37:15.527 --> 37:17.761
Maggie.

37:17.786 --> 37:20.316
Dr. Rhodes said you
were covering for me.

37:20.341 --> 37:22.727
Yes, and thank God you are back.

37:22.752 --> 37:24.258
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.029
That's okay. If he was driving Uber,

37:26.054 --> 37:28.334
he'd get five stars.

37:28.359 --> 37:30.057
I was worried about you.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.971
I'm fine.

37:33.645 --> 37:35.345
Why is everybody standing around?

37:35.370 --> 37:36.913
Back to work, Reese.

37:36.938 --> 37:39.217
Chop chop.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.247
You're Dr. Rhodes?

37:51.272 --> 37:52.719
- Yeah.
- I had it checked.

37:52.744 --> 37:53.863
Dr. Halstead used your code

37:53.888 --> 37:56.233
to access Jennifer Baker's records,
didn't he?

37:56.808 --> 37:59.275
- Look, I-I didn't...
- I don't care about any of it.

37:59.380 --> 38:01.901
He found out that she's
only on a placebo.

38:01.926 --> 38:04.246
I'm afraid he's going to tell her.

38:09.427 --> 38:12.606
I'll handle it.

38:17.514 --> 38:20.184
[panting]

38:20.209 --> 38:24.806
Eighth floor.
Clinical trial wing, seriously?

38:25.273 --> 38:27.370
When I helped you out earlier,

38:27.395 --> 38:29.214
I didn't think it was
gonna lead to this.

38:29.239 --> 38:31.946
What do you care?

38:33.299 --> 38:34.904
Well, I'm not going to stand by

38:34.929 --> 38:36.374
and watch another guy ruin his life.

38:36.399 --> 38:38.297
- Hey!
- No.

38:38.322 --> 38:39.863
- [alarm ringing]
- You're not gonna stop me.

38:39.888 --> 38:41.621
Actually, I am.

38:42.228 --> 38:44.524
- Hey.
- [struggling]

38:44.549 --> 38:46.111
- Damn it!
- [grunts]

38:46.136 --> 38:48.307
You're not supposed to go near her.

38:48.332 --> 38:49.931
You tell her she's on a placebo,

38:49.956 --> 38:52.374
that's your license, okay?

38:54.363 --> 38:56.598
She can go home!

38:56.623 --> 39:00.238
You're a good doctor.

39:00.263 --> 39:03.745
The world needs good doctors, you ass.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.605
[panting]

39:15.647 --> 39:18.549
[alarm stops, elevator hums]

39:46.076 --> 39:49.029
- Ms. Reese.
- Hmm?

39:49.054 --> 39:52.394
Um, I was unkind to you,

39:52.419 --> 39:57.108
and I hope that you'll
allow me to apologize.

39:59.235 --> 40:01.670
It's okay.

40:01.695 --> 40:05.238
You were sleeping.

40:05.263 --> 40:07.071
I woke you.

40:07.096 --> 40:11.841
That is a good way to put it.

40:21.514 --> 40:24.276
<i>You don't like Chicago-style popcorn?</i>

40:24.301 --> 40:26.668
<i>Mixing caramel with cheese flavors?</i>

40:26.693 --> 40:29.348
Sweet and salty...
It's the greatest duo.

40:29.373 --> 40:32.141
I thought the great duo
was Jordan and Pippen.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.465
Oh.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.323
[sighs]

40:35.348 --> 40:37.803
I've been off my meds.

40:38.872 --> 40:41.163
Since when?

40:41.760 --> 40:45.064
I started titrating myself
down about ten days ago.

40:45.089 --> 40:48.443
I'm sorry.
It was a little chemistry experiment.

40:48.468 --> 40:52.058
I really should have told
you during our last session.

40:52.083 --> 40:55.417
- How's the experiment going?
- Not great.

40:55.847 --> 40:58.785
The black cloud is descending.

40:58.810 --> 41:01.109
There ain't no denying it.

41:01.135 --> 41:03.727
Why did you go off?

41:05.089 --> 41:09.972
About a month ago, I just...
I started to feel fuzzy, you know?

41:09.997 --> 41:13.225
Like I was losing my edge,
like my antenna...

41:13.250 --> 41:16.975
I mean, you know the focus that
it takes to treat patients.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.103
I was worried that I was
gonna make a mistake.

41:20.392 --> 41:23.843
Danny, you also can't treat
patients if you're depressed.

41:23.868 --> 41:26.236
You'd think I would've
figured that out by now.

41:26.261 --> 41:28.261
Let me adjust your dose.

41:28.286 --> 41:31.380
We'll figure out a balance.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.866
Okay.

41:35.673 --> 41:38.520
Hey, there you go.

41:39.021 --> 41:42.202
So, how was your day?
You save some lives?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.580
Okay, got it.

41:48.605 --> 41:50.246
Not feeling chatty.
