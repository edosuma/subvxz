WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.598
Previously on Elementary...
A member of a rival gang

00:03.630 --> 00:05.325
was shot and killed
in SBK territory last night.

00:05.370 --> 00:08.237
I didn't have nothin' to do
with what happened to that man.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.703
They also saw
two men who fled.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.469
One of them tossed
a gun as he ran.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.808
I think that one of the men
the police is looking for

00:13.840 --> 00:15.171
is Shinwell Johnson.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.643
I'm not back in SBK
'cause I want to be.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.409
I'm an informant
for the FBI.

00:18.450 --> 00:19.269
He showed me his badge.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.070
WATSON:
You said his name was Whitlock.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.769
Any information
that he gathered,

00:21.820 --> 00:23.082
anything he
did for me

00:23.120 --> 00:24.314
was completely off the books.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.487
If you don't do something,

00:25.520 --> 00:27.181
he's gonna be sent back
to prison.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.723
It's the cloth I used
to wipe the gun.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.149
Hadn't been processed
yet. When it is,

00:32.200 --> 00:33.451
there won't be any prints on it.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.798
It's your second
second chance.

00:35.830 --> 00:38.526
Do make the most of it.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.629
(door opens)

00:43.810 --> 00:45.766
(whistling)

00:45.810 --> 00:47.801
*

00:59.490 --> 01:02.254
SHINWELL:
What do you think?

01:02.290 --> 01:04.656
About. . .?
Table.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.328
I saw it downstairs.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.420
Thought I'd restore
it as a gift.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.494
For you and Doc.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.566
So, it is the one from the...

01:12.600 --> 01:14.795
storage area, in the basement.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.638
Yeah, the top was nicked
in a couple places,

01:17.670 --> 01:20.104
and one of the legs was loose.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.630
But, uh, I fixed it up.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.874
Refinished it, and...

01:22.910 --> 01:25.743
you can hardly
recognize it, right?

01:25.780 --> 01:27.475
What you did for me.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.385
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.551
What?

01:33.560 --> 01:35.516
Nothing.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.289
It's just, um...

01:37.330 --> 01:39.423
the table was...
I-It was eVIdence

01:39.460 --> 01:42.224
in a 78-year-old murder

01:42.270 --> 01:43.669
I was trying to solve.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.737
(chuckles)
You're playin' with me.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.268
No, you're not playin' with me.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.777
The Minetta
Chess Club Slaying.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.505
Greenwich Village, 1938.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.906
The table was from the scene.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.508
Took me, um...

01:58.550 --> 02:01.644
Took me a few years
to track it down.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.614
The, uh...

02:03.650 --> 02:06.483
chips were the, uh...

02:06.520 --> 02:08.488
well, it was from
all the stabbing.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.454
No, it's just as well.
Because, I mean,

02:10.490 --> 02:12.924
my progress was very slow, so...
this is going to force me

02:12.960 --> 02:15.690
to look at the case another way.

02:15.730 --> 02:18.619
It's an even more appropriate
gift than you intended, because

02:18.670 --> 02:21.639
I destroyed evidence
for you, and now...
(phone beeps)

02:26.210 --> 02:29.805
I would offer to break
it in with you, but, uh,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.249
I have to go.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.817
Can you tell the
doc I said bye?

02:43.560 --> 02:45.824
Shinwell is still
engaged with SBK.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.522
He's got two ringtones on
his phone. One for his work

02:48.560 --> 02:50.562
as a handyman,
the other for the gang.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.659
The one I just heard upstairs
was the latter.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.828
Right. Because he's
still gathering intel.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.862
Agent Whitlock of the FBI
couldn't be more dead.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.673
Even if he wasn't, his goal

03:00.710 --> 03:03.543
was to steal from SBK,
not dismantle them.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.775
Right. But he still wants
to bring SBK down.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.471
By himself?
No.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.579
He knows he needs help,
so he asked me

03:09.620 --> 03:12.555
to connect him with someone
from the Bronx Gang Squad.

03:12.590 --> 03:14.410
You remember
that Detective Guzman?

03:14.460 --> 03:16.587
We helped protect one
of his witnesses once?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.656
When I committed a felony
to keep Shinwell out of prison,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.452
it was so he would
have the opportunity

03:21.500 --> 03:22.592
to get his life straight.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.495
He i getting his life straight.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.430
He's finishing what he started.

03:26.470 --> 03:27.835
You think that's wise?

03:27.870 --> 03:29.565
I think that's
what he wants to do.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.828
Ah...
Listen, he risked his life

03:31.870 --> 03:33.371
to get back into SBK.
They trust him.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.672
He doesn't
just want to waste that.

03:34.710 --> 03:37.599
Did you think he was
just gonna leave town?

03:37.650 --> 03:39.470
I thought he would find
a clever way

03:39.520 --> 03:41.579
to extricate himself
from the gang.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.544
Well, then maybe you should've
talked to him

03:44.590 --> 03:46.751
before you wiped
his prints from that .38.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.610
I should have.
Look,

03:48.660 --> 03:50.651
Guzman and Shinwell are gonna
meet in a couple of days.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.851
If things go well,
he'll be registered

03:52.900 --> 03:55.949
as a CI. for the NYPD. This
time he'll have real support.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.991
(phone beeping)

03:59.670 --> 04:00.830
It's Marcus.

04:00.870 --> 04:03.304
He wants to meet me
at the morgue.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.467
We'll talk more
on the way there.
Actually,

04:05.510 --> 04:06.772
he only wants me.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.698
(elevator bell dings,
doors sliding)

04:08.740 --> 04:10.776
Dead guy's name
is Jeffrey Banks.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.038
Opioid addict.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.741
OD'd on oxycodone.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.317
The 8-7 caught it,
but a buddy of mine there

04:16.350 --> 04:17.840
gave me a heads-up.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.710
DEA's been all over it.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.681
They're considering
criminal charges

04:20.720 --> 04:23.052
against the doctor
who wrote the prescription.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.558
Something about an
online monitoring system,

04:25.590 --> 04:27.729
that it was the doctor's job
to check?

04:27.760 --> 04:31.594
Yeah, it's to make sure addicts
aren't doctor shopping,

04:31.630 --> 04:33.689
getting the same script
from multiple doctors.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.731
So, if whoever wrote
Banks' script

04:35.770 --> 04:36.759
didn't check it, they're liable.

04:38.810 --> 04:39.970
So, how can I help?

04:40.010 --> 04:42.649
So you don't know
this guy, right?

04:42.680 --> 04:45.672
Never seen him before?
Why would I?

04:45.710 --> 04:48.713
Because according to the script
this guy used to overdose,

04:48.750 --> 04:50.684
you're the one who wrote it.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.712
*

04:59.830 --> 05:01.559
MAN:
All due respect, Dr. Watson,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.022
considering you're the subject
of our investigation,

05:03.070 --> 05:04.958
there's only so much
I can share with you.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.389
_ I understand.
But If you're focusmg on me,

05:07.440 --> 05:09.465
your investigation
is off to a bad start.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.808
GREGSON: Agent Ritter.
Your boss, Ken.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.671
He tell you how far
he and I go back?

05:13.710 --> 05:15.871
Then give us
some credit.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.878
We're trying
to save you some time.

05:17.910 --> 05:21.368
She didn't write that
prescription for Jeffrey Banks.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.684
_ Mr. Banks' name
IS just one of many.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.041
We've identified multiple
improper opioid scripts,

05:26.090 --> 05:28.115
all bearing your license
and DEA numbers.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.025
Obviously, someone stole
my information.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.085
I haven't practiced
medicine in ten years.

05:32.130 --> 05:33.859
Then why did you keep
your license current?

05:33.900 --> 05:36.027
HOLMES: I asked my partner
the same question.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.426
The answer is simple:
professional pride.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.995
Watson studied for over a dozen
years to become a surgeon.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.463
So, if she's
guilty of anything,

05:43.510 --> 05:45.068
it's of not wanting
to let hard-won accomplishments

05:45.110 --> 05:47.374
fall by the wayside.
I don't know
what to tell you.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.401
It's her name
on all the scripts.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.668
You say we're dealing
with an identity thief,

05:51.710 --> 05:53.678
only I haven't come across
any evidence of that.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.369
HOLMES: We'll be happy
to find you some

05:55.420 --> 05:57.547
if you tell us what you know.
I got another idea.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.582
Don't step on another agency's
toes. Let us do our jobs.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.082
BELL:
Hey.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.394
How'd it go?

06:08.430 --> 06:10.762
They suspended my license and
sent out an alert to pharmacies

06:10.800 --> 06:13.769
saying that no one should
accept my prescriptions.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.665
Not that I'm writing any.
The act inspires

06:15.700 --> 06:18.032
little confidence
in the DEA's investigation.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.503
It's hard to imagine
a government agency

06:19.540 --> 06:20.768
finding an imposter
when their position

06:20.810 --> 06:23.404
is the imposter doesn't exist.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.600
You holding up?
I'm fine.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.414
I just want to find this person
before anyone else gets hurt.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.008
Thanks for putting in the call.

06:30.050 --> 06:33.486
Keep me in the loop.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.158
BELL:
Got a sec?
Yeah.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.556
I talked some more
with my friend at the 8-7.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.421
He said the doctor's
address that was printed

06:39.460 --> 06:42.190
on Jeffrey Banks' script
led to a mailbox store.

06:42.230 --> 06:45.199
No security cameras, just
a box rented to Joan Watson.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.539
Phone number's a prepaid cell.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.959
Meaning it could have been me
just as easy as someone else.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.535
As far as the DEA's concerned?
Yeah.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.468
He also gave me this.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.808
That's the pharmacy where Banks
filled the prescription.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.147
It was handwritten,
so they would have

06:58.180 --> 06:59.579
the actual sheet of paper

06:59.620 --> 07:01.474
the imposter wrote on.
If you can talk them

07:01.520 --> 07:03.488
into letting you look,
maybe it'll help.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.442
It's in Hoboken.
Yeah. It makes sense.

07:05.490 --> 07:08.209
Scripts in New York are almost
entirely electronic now.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.478
It raises fewer eyebrows

07:10.530 --> 07:12.919
to fill a handwritten one
out of state.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.450
Plus, that monitoring system
that's supposed

07:14.500 --> 07:15.558
to keep patients
from doctor shopping,

07:15.600 --> 07:17.124
from what I read,
it gets checked

07:17.170 --> 07:19.468
a lot less consistently
between states.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.559
Convincing the pharmacist
to show us the prescription

07:21.600 --> 07:23.602
might be another hurdle
altogether.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.473
You're right. I think it'll
be better if I go alone.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.728
That way, it's one medical
professional to another.

07:28.780 --> 07:31.169
Let me know how it goes.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.147
Can I see your
department directory?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.944
Sure. Who you calling?

07:38.990 --> 07:42.528
There's a detective in the Bronx
I need to speak to.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.087
(quietly):
Thank you.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.519
If you need me again,
all right? Take care.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.788
HOLMES:
Detective Guzman.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.264
Hey! Holmes, man.
How the hell are you?

07:52.300 --> 07:54.598
Your squad said
I could find you here.
Yeah.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.632
I know Joan is expecting
a call back from me about
her friend, Stonewall?

07:57.670 --> 08:00.138
Shinwell.
I just needed to get through
this court appearance,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.876
and now that I'm clear of
it, I'll be able to
meet up with the guy.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.002
Don't.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.199
Don't what?

08:05.250 --> 08:06.842
Don't meet Shinwell.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.041
I thought he was all
dialed in with SBK.
He IS.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.116
That's why you should
keep your distance.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.683
PHARMACIST:
I'm sorry,

08:14.720 --> 08:17.188
this doesn't feel right.
The DEA's already been here.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.583
This is part
of their investigation.

08:18.630 --> 08:20.723
You're not even really police.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.729
True, but I'm not asking
as a police consultant.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.228
I'm asking because
I am Dr. Joan Watson.

08:27.270 --> 08:29.261
Which means I either
wrote the prescription,

08:29.300 --> 08:32.064
in which case I know
everything that's on it,

08:32.110 --> 08:34.670
or I didn't write it,
in which case the DEA

08:34.710 --> 08:36.746
could decide to penalize you
for filling it.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.217
I hate to say it,

08:46.250 --> 08:47.911
but it's perfect.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.588
I mean, it's not my handwriting,
but other than that,

08:50.630 --> 08:53.053
I can see why the DEA
doubts my story.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.318
I'm sorry it wasn't more help.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.918
Actually, I spoke too soon.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.699
That J,

08:58.730 --> 09:00.960
it stands for Jingyi,
it's my Chinese name.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.706
I used it for a short time
professronally

09:02.740 --> 09:04.731
at a hospital I used to work at.

09:04.770 --> 09:07.170
How does that help?
Well, it tells me

09:07.210 --> 09:10.179
where the identity thief
stole my information from.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.872
Corona General Hospital
in Queens.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.740
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.789
(door opens)

09:24.360 --> 09:26.351
*

09:26.390 --> 09:28.324
Sometimes I wonder what hobbies

09:28.360 --> 09:29.759
other people's
roommates have.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.722
I briefly shared
a flat in London

09:31.770 --> 09:33.362
with a collector
of Wild game urine.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.631
He used it as a lure
for hunting and trapping.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.230
Oh. Then I count my blessings.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.272
Well, I embraced
the opportunity

09:41.310 --> 09:43.369
to educate my olfactory
palate, but...

09:43.410 --> 09:45.605
I must admit,
it's not for everyone.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.847
I thought you said the table
wasn't helpful anymore.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.940
I noticed that Shinwell hadn't
sanded down the knife chips,

09:51.990 --> 09:54.379
but rather packed them
with wood ﬁller.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.184
I can still make out the angle
of attack of each strike.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.050
Hence, my efforts
to determine

09:59.090 --> 10:01.752
the killer's height, build,
left- or right-handedness

10:01.800 --> 10:03.290
may continue.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.764
Did you see my text
about Corona General?

10:05.800 --> 10:08.667
I did. I checked the hospital's
online directory.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.634
Sure enough, your contact
information had been replaced

10:10.670 --> 10:12.638
with the thief's
mailbox information

10:12.680 --> 10:15.638
and burner phone. I also
gave the hospital's computer

10:15.680 --> 10:17.773
security measures
a thorough prodding.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.744
System is far too porous
to have logged

10:19.780 --> 10:21.645
who made the changes and when.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.739
I've had a harder time breaking
into an advent calendar.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.714
Which is why you turned your
attention back to the cold case.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.149
Not before the ease of breaking
into the system itself

10:29.190 --> 10:31.078
gave me another thought. Hmm?

10:32.360 --> 10:33.429
It occurred to me

10:33.460 --> 10:35.052
to look for other doctors

10:35.100 --> 10:37.227
whose information
had also been changed.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.797
If, like you, their office
numbers were now...

10:40.840 --> 10:43.058
prepaid mobiles,
then surely the area codes

10:43.110 --> 10:44.737
would be easy enough to spot.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.672
Iidenﬁﬁed
three such doctors.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.246
Like you,
their office addresses

10:50.280 --> 10:52.771
are now mailbox stores.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.412
So you think
these three doctors

10:54.450 --> 10:56.680
had their identities
stolen by the same thief.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.085
I've passed this information on
to Marcus.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.111
He's now canvassing
the mailbox stores.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.287
_The one which was rented
In your name was no help,

11:02.320 --> 11:04.720
but perhaps these
others will be.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.149
Have you, uh, heard from
Detective Guzman today?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.690
No, why?

11:08.730 --> 11:10.095
I paid him a visit.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.690
I advised him not
to take on Shinwell as a CI.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.368
What?
Understand, I admire
Shinwell's ambition.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.800
I think his goal
could not be more worthy.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.479
But as an undercover operative,
I find him wanting.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.171
What are you
talking about?

11:22.210 --> 11:23.905
He lacks the guile
to play multiple sides.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.748
Not to mention the rudimentary
skills of survival.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.270
Shinwell's not a survivor?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.469
He was a gang member
most of his life.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.408
He survived nearly
a decade in prison.

11:31.450 --> 11:32.417
Both of which involve

11:32.450 --> 11:34.782
rigid societal roles

11:34.820 --> 11:37.220
and say nothing about
his capacity for subterfuge.

11:37.260 --> 11:39.182
That doesn't mean
he can't do it.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.857
No, evidence suggests that.

11:40.900 --> 11:41.924
He allowed himself
to be duped

11:41.960 --> 11:43.291
by an FBI agent
who told him

11:43.330 --> 11:45.127
he was a registered informant,
when he wasn't.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.421
He left his fingerprints
on a gun

11:46.470 --> 11:47.892
at the scene of a murder
he did not commit.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.191
And how did you two
meet again?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.730
Wait, hold on a second.
That's right!

11:50.770 --> 11:51.805
You pulled five bullets
out of him after he was

11:51.840 --> 11:53.307
ambushed and shot.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.831
Now that I know him better,
I'm surprised he didn't

11:55.880 --> 11:57.472
step on an open bear trap
and then fall down a well.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.819
I'm sorry, but if I'd have known
he was going to remain with SBK,

11:59.850 --> 12:01.772
I never would have wiped
his fingerprints from that gun.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.219
The man's safer in prison.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.445
You...
(computer chimes)

12:05.490 --> 12:08.186
What is this?
It's Marcus.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.829
"Checking other mailbox
stores paid off.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.191
"Security picture of woman

12:13.230 --> 12:15.255
who rented one of the boxes
attached."

12:18.030 --> 12:21.033
I know that woman.

12:21.070 --> 12:24.164
She was at Corona General
the same time I was.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.768
Dr. Franny Krieg.

12:31.810 --> 12:34.176
That's her. She's
the identity thief.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.848
Were you close?
She was in rheumatology,

12:36.890 --> 12:37.845
so we didn't
intersect much.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.380
We just said hi
in the halls.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.854
According to this,
her practice is in Jamaica.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.790
Hello?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.505
Dr. Krieg?

12:59.540 --> 13:02.008
I don't think anyone's
going to answer.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.044
There's burnt gunpowder
in the air, about an hour old.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.321
(door creaking)

13:22.870 --> 13:24.997
(sniffing)

13:34.240 --> 13:35.901
It's Dr. Krieg.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.351
She's gone.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.891
Marla Ridgley Moore,
address in Great Neck.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.295
It's hard to say whether
she had anything to do

14:00.340 --> 14:02.399
with Dr. Krieg's
opioid trafficking.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.237
Her getting killed
certainly did.

14:04.270 --> 14:07.205
These are from the Bureau
of Narcotic Enforcement.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.073
They print all the prescription
pads for New York state.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.975
They're packing slips
from those boxes--

14:12.010 --> 14:12.977
they're all empty.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.271
Whoever did this
took the pads.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.984
HOLMES: Five boxes.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.952
One for each of_t_he doctors
she was writing as.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.480
You included.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.398
20 pads per box,
100 pages per pad.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.625
(sighs): That's 10,000
more opportunities

14:30.670 --> 14:32.490
for addicts to overdose.

14:39.510 --> 14:40.909
Entry wounds are
all in the front,

14:40.940 --> 14:43.977
so they were facing
their attacker.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.648
He fired from the doorway
before entering

14:45.680 --> 14:48.012
to collect the pads.

14:48.050 --> 14:52.009
Blood spatter on the cabinet
supports that it was closed

14:52.050 --> 14:53.688
at the time of the shooting

14:53.720 --> 14:56.450
before being opened, where
the blood dripped down

14:56.490 --> 14:57.684
onto the floor here.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.948
Any receptionist
out front?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.922
She'd already left.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.019
Watson and Bell went
to speak with her.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.697
According to her,
Dr. Krieg was in the habit

15:05.730 --> 15:07.561
of sending her
home for the day

15:07.600 --> 15:09.397
_once the last _
apporntment had arrived,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.499
which, in this case,
was 4:00 pm.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.179
Once the M.E.'s given us
the time of death,

15:14.210 --> 15:16.075
we'll be able to confirm
the receptionist's timellne

15:16.110 --> 15:18.340
and check the security
footage at Jamaica Station.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.018
Make sure she was there
when she said she was, yeah?

15:20.050 --> 15:23.087
So Joan's identity was
stolen by a doctor?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.087
She was running

15:24.120 --> 15:25.280
a pill mill.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.117
She stole the credentials
of four doctors,

15:27.160 --> 15:28.980
including Watson's,
and used them

15:29.020 --> 15:30.521
to sell opioid scripts.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.050
Using multiple identities

15:32.090 --> 15:33.591
makes it much less likely
to raise any flags.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.723
Maybe one of her customers
decided

15:35.760 --> 15:37.398
to cut out the middleman.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.694
Why pay a doc every time
you want a new script

15:39.730 --> 15:41.994
when you can take
all the pads for yourself?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.964
Yeah, that's what
we were thinking.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.238
And the other victim,
Miss Moore?

15:46.270 --> 15:47.976
Do we know her
connection?

15:48.010 --> 15:50.649
HOLMES: The receptionist said
she was the mother of a patient.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.102
She was here
for consultation.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.209
So perhaps she was
just collateral damage.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.047
Perhaps she was the
mother of a patient

15:56.080 --> 15:57.445
and involved
in the pill mill.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.219
It's very difficult
to say.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.081
And hopefully we'll know more
once we've spoken to the family.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.656
I'll reach out
to the DEA.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.988
Tell 'em about this
and everything

16:05.030 --> 16:07.351
you found out about Dr. Krieg.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.621
Should get them off
Joan's back.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.366
MAN: I should have
been there with her.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.493
I was the patient, not her.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.201
There's nothing
you could have done.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.333
I'd have lost
you, too.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.439
Ethan, come on,
sit down.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.488
Was it unusual
for your mom to go

16:36.520 --> 16:37.748
to Dr. Krieg's office
without you?

16:37.790 --> 16:40.224
No.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.023
I've been sick
since I was a kid.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.119
My mom always dealt
with everything,

16:44.170 --> 16:45.592
with all of the doctors.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.734
There was a
scheduling mix-up.

16:47.770 --> 16:50.034
My physical therapy
was at the same time

16:50.070 --> 16:52.436
as my appointment
with Dr. Krieg.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.108
They were just
gonna talk over

16:54.140 --> 16:55.072
new treatment
options for me,

16:55.110 --> 16:56.429
so I didn't go.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.040
Can I ask you
about your diagnosis?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.514
You can ask.

17:01.550 --> 17:05.042
I just wish
I could tell you.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.739
Mostly they call it

17:06.790 --> 17:09.054
"non-specific
autoimmune disorder."

17:09.090 --> 17:10.648
Which, I've learned,
is doctor-speak

17:10.690 --> 17:13.420
for "we have no idea."

17:13.460 --> 17:15.155
I have a lot
of joint pain.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.121
My muscles are weak.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.594
I get sick a lot.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.791
I really hit the jackpot.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.132
And, Mr. Moore,
were you here

17:24.170 --> 17:26.604
with Ethan while your wife
went to Dr. Krieg's?

17:26.640 --> 17:28.528
Uh, no. I don't
actually live here.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.844
Maria and I split up last year.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.644
I-I came over as soon
as I heard what happened.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.148
Then I have to ask,

17:36.180 --> 17:36.942
can you account
for your whereabouts

17:36.980 --> 17:39.778
between 4:00
and 6:00 pm. yesterday?

17:39.820 --> 17:41.651
Yes, I was at a friend's
watching the Riviera Cup.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.079
It's a golf tournament.
I'll give you his number.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.849
Did your ex-wife have
a history of pain?

17:46.890 --> 17:48.858
Was she on any
medications?

17:48.900 --> 17:51.164
No. Why?

17:51.200 --> 17:53.395
We think Dr. Krieg was
operating a pill mill.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.089
Are you familiar
with the term?

17:55.140 --> 17:58.564
Wait, you think
she was a drug dealer?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.373
To be clear, as of right now,

18:00.410 --> 18:02.105
we just think your mom was
in the wrong place

18:02.140 --> 18:03.300
at the wrong time.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.308
But if she was involved
in the other side

18:06.350 --> 18:07.612
of Dr. Krieg's business,

18:07.650 --> 18:09.140
getting it all out in the open

18:09.180 --> 18:10.886
might help us find
whoever did this.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.581
I'm sorry, no, no.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.759
Marla wasn't _involved
In anything like that.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.451
Y-You can look around
If you want,

18:16.490 --> 18:17.889
I mean, check
the medicine cabinets.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.728
but I don't think
you'll find anything.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.662
I remember seeing
this guy once...

18:24.700 --> 18:26.725
in Dr. Krieg's waiting room.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.795
It was a couple
of weeks ago.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.660
He was older than me.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.270
205, maybe.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.232
He was in real bad shape.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.771
Shaking, sweating.

18:37.810 --> 18:40.176
Hunched over, like
he had a stomachache.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.280
I just thought he was sick.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.810
So now you're wondering
if this was an addict

18:46.350 --> 18:49.183
Well, Dr. Krieg
told him to leave.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.256
And he did.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.155
But he was angry.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.589
I'll check with
Dr. Krieg's receptionist,

18:55.630 --> 18:58.190
see if she can tell us
who that patient was.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.289
Meantime, you think
you could describe him

19:00.340 --> 19:01.762
to a sketch artist?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.303
I could try.

19:13.350 --> 19:16.842
That time already?
Why? You light, D?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.848
Hell no.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.188
It's been like this
all day.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.484
We're gonna have
to start using bigger bags.

19:27.630 --> 19:30.269
Ain't you gonna take it?

19:32.330 --> 19:35.299
You see that homie
over there-- the big one?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.308
DUANE:
What about him?

19:37.340 --> 19:38.602
Could have sworn I saw him

19:38.640 --> 19:40.198
outside my apartment
this morning.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.901
You think he's Five-O?

19:41.940 --> 19:43.305
What you think?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.873
I think you trippin'.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.444
DUANE:
Brother's too big.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.242
Never seen a big cop?

19:52.290 --> 19:54.258
I'm looking for cops
all the time.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.484
It's what I do here.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.728
I got, like,
a spidey sense.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.421
Dude's no cop.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.520
We'll finish
our busmess later.

20:20.350 --> 20:23.319
Take care.
All right, then.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.854
(doorbell ringing)

20:38.970 --> 20:40.961
Can I come in?
Sure.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.403
Something the matter?

20:47.440 --> 20:49.772
I was being followed.
A big dude.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.277
I lost him,
but I don't...

20:51.310 --> 20:52.971
Shinwell, I'd like you
to meet my friend Luc.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.272
Luc, voici Shinwell.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.947
Luc, merci pour ton

20:55.980 --> 20:58.642
excellent travail
et trs bientt.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.695
You had me tailed this morning?
Actually,

21:07.730 --> 21:09.322
he's been following you
since last night.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.588
When you finally caught
on and evaded him,

21:10.630 --> 21:11.722
he got a cab here.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.964
I'm assuming that you walked.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.332
I did, three miles
out of my way.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.462
(phone ringing)

21:18.440 --> 21:19.805
Tell me, what is this about?

21:19.840 --> 21:22.809
Watson said you want to continue
your work as a CI.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.343
(ringing continues)
She thinks it suits you.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.779
I don't.
(ringing stops)

21:26.810 --> 21:29.415
So I urge you,
quit while you're still alive.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.442
What I do is_
none of your busmess.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.912
I infiltrated a police lab
on your behalf.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.587
I wiped your fingerprints
off a weapon,

21:35.620 --> 21:37.326
I think that gives me
plenty of skin in the game.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.352
When you first came to
Watson, you said you wanted

21:40.400 --> 21:42.095
to get your life
on a better track,

21:42.130 --> 21:44.621
in order to become the kind of
person that you would conSIder

21:44.670 --> 21:47.559
worthy of reconnecting
with your daughter, Chivonne.

21:47.600 --> 21:52.367
Operating as an informant
is hardly that, is it?

21:54.480 --> 21:55.435
once before, in prison.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.846
So do it again, outside prison.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.007
Watson could be
there to help.

22:00.050 --> 22:02.473
All you have to do is ask.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.880
I'll think on it.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.396
Hey, it's Marcus.
Ballistics came back

22:17.430 --> 22:18.863
on the rounds removed
from the victims.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.391
They match a slug pulled
from the arm of a mugging victim

22:21.440 --> 22:23.567
two years ago.
Mugger was never caught.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.464
Joan and I are gonna
talk to the victim,

22:25.510 --> 22:28.104
_see what he remembers.
Figured you'd want to j0in.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.375
I was walking home
to my apartment

22:31.410 --> 22:32.900
and this guy grabs me
from behind.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.474
Shoved me up against a car,

22:34.520 --> 22:35.771
sticks a gun in my face,

22:35.820 --> 22:37.447
and he said,
"Give me your wallet."

22:37.490 --> 22:39.446
I guess
I took too long.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.056
Shot me right here.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.126
Arm's never been the same.
The night it happened,

22:44.160 --> 22:46.025
you told police that
you didn't get a good look

22:46.060 --> 22:47.425
at the mugger's face.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.451
So, maybe you
remembered something more

22:49.500 --> 22:51.092
after the initial shock
wore off?

22:51.130 --> 22:53.894
It was dark,
it happened fast.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.931
I think...

22:55.970 --> 22:57.403
I was staring more
at the gun

22:57.440 --> 22:58.759
than at the guy.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.028
According to
the emergency room report,

23:01.080 --> 23:03.878
they also removed some
auto glass from your shoulder?

23:03.910 --> 23:05.639
Yeah, car window, uh,

23:05.680 --> 23:06.942
broke when he shot me,
there was--

23:06.980 --> 23:08.447
there was glass everywhere.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.539
And the police subsequently
looked for the car

23:10.590 --> 23:12.182
but couldn't find it.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.778
So, presumably,
the driver returned,

23:13.820 --> 23:15.651
he saw his broken window
and he just drove off.

23:15.690 --> 23:17.885
Yeah, I guess.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.022
Yeah.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.186
Except you're lying.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.118
Excuse me?

23:22.160 --> 23:23.559
You claim you were pushed up
against the car

23:23.600 --> 23:24.897
before someone shot you there,

23:24.930 --> 23:26.625
in the front of your arm,
but according to the ER,

23:26.670 --> 23:28.194
the glass came from the same
direction as the bullet,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.538
which means whoever shot you
did so through the car window,

23:30.570 --> 23:31.901
so what's the truth?

23:31.940 --> 23:33.635
I can come up with
any number of scenarios.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.830
You being mugged
isn't one of them.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.131
Given your deceit,
I'm inclined to think

23:37.180 --> 23:38.545
that you were
attempting a carjacking,

23:38.580 --> 23:39.569
and your would-be victim
was armed.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.917
BELL:
Mr. Fisk,

23:41.950 --> 23:42.974
even without the
attempted carjacking,

23:43.020 --> 23:43.987
I can still charge you with

23:44.020 --> 23:46.887
filing a false police
report about a shooting.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.218
But honestly, we're a lot
less interested in any of that

23:49.260 --> 23:51.455
than we are in ﬁnding
whoever fired the gun.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.822
So, how 'bout you
tell us the truth?

23:53.860 --> 23:57.193
And we'll all just agree
that you've suffered enough.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.963
It was a silver Lexus.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.238
It just pulled
out of a parking lot

24:05.270 --> 24:06.601
and up to a light;

24:06.640 --> 24:08.232
there was a guy and a girl
in the car.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.168
I pulled
the driver's door open,

24:10.210 --> 24:11.040
I shouted for them
to get out,

24:11.080 --> 24:13.913
but then the guy
yanked it closed again.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.815
And before I knew it,
he had a gun out from somewhere

24:15.850 --> 24:17.112
and he was shooting at me.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.481
Iran.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.511
I was lucky to get out
of there alive.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.619
You remember where
this took place?

24:22.660 --> 24:24.127
Yeah, out in Hempstead.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.253
They were leaving one of those
big furniture stores.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.497
Ridgley's.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.662
Would you excuse us a minute?

24:35.570 --> 24:36.889
(door opens)

24:40.980 --> 24:42.572
The woman who was killed

24:42.610 --> 24:43.804
alongside Dr. Krieg,

24:43.850 --> 24:44.999
her full name was

24:45.050 --> 24:46.142
Marla Ridgley Moore.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.787
You think it's Ridgley
like the furniture stores?

24:51.820 --> 24:53.515
Furniture empire,
more like.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.016
Hundreds of stores, worth

24:55.060 --> 24:55.810
many millions
of dollars.

24:55.860 --> 24:56.815
BELL: All right,
but I'm confused.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.124
What does any of this have to do
with Dr. Krieg

24:59.160 --> 25:00.229
and the stolen pads?

25:00.260 --> 25:01.955
Nothing, that's the point.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.264
The same gun used
to kill the heiress

25:04.300 --> 25:06.097
to the Ridgley
furniture fortune

25:06.130 --> 25:08.269
was also used by a man exiting
a Ridgley's Furniture lot

25:08.300 --> 25:09.597
two years ago.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.130
That could be coincidence, but

25:11.170 --> 25:13.638
the odds overwhelmingly
favor another explanation.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.875
The stolen pads
were a smokescreen.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.105
Franny Krieg was just
collateral damage.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.573
Marla Moore was the real target.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.975
We've been trying to solve
the wrong murder.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.188
This whole thing is insane.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.754
BELL:
Really?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.722
'Cause the judge kind of
saw it our way.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.558
We checked, you own
a 9mm Smith & Wesson.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.692
Same caliber used to shoot

25:39.730 --> 25:41.766
a would-be carjacker
two years ago.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.701
And to kill your ex-wife
and Dr. Krieg yesterday.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.004
We also know you used
to drive a silver Lexus.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.874
Just like the one Lee Fisk
was trying to steal in 2014.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.707
Why would I kill Marla?

25:52.750 --> 25:53.717
You're divorced.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.546
Yes, but it wasn't

25:54.580 --> 25:56.878
contentious,
not as those things go.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.785
And if you think
I was after her money,

25:58.820 --> 26:00.651
I've been out of her will
for over a year.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.681
You're forgetting about
the will of her father--

26:02.720 --> 26:05.257
furniture tycoon
Sam Ridgley.

26:05.290 --> 26:06.780
I'm not in that one, either.

26:06.830 --> 26:07.922
But your son is.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.723
And while he's legally an adult,

26:09.760 --> 26:11.261
he still requires
a great deal of care.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.927
And with Maria dead,

26:12.970 --> 26:16.360
you're free to step back
into the role of caretaker

26:16.400 --> 26:18.334
and resume a
life of luxury.

26:19.410 --> 26:22.834
(whispers):
All right, fine.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.269
I admit that I was carjacked
two years ago

26:25.310 --> 26:28.017
and that I tried
to shoot the guy.

26:28.050 --> 26:31.713
I didn't report it because I--

26:31.750 --> 26:34.355
because I was having an affair
with one of Marla's employees.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.950
A woman named
Janine Roth.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.288
I was picking her up
from work that night.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.854
I couldn't tell Marla,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.822
so I lied about
how the window broke

26:42.860 --> 26:44.725
and kept the rest
to myself.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.295
I was a bad husband.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.992
But Marla,

26:50.040 --> 26:51.905
she was a saint.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.362
Okay, the stress on her,

26:53.410 --> 26:54.900
the time and effort
to take care of Ethan,

26:54.940 --> 26:56.305
I could have never done that.

26:56.340 --> 26:59.241
And I could never
have hurt her.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.145
So where's the gun now?

27:01.180 --> 27:02.738
In the garage
at the house.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.089
I stashed it in my tool drawer

27:05.120 --> 27:07.145
after I shot the man
who attacked me and Janine.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.782
I haven't seen it since.

27:08.820 --> 27:10.788
Mr. Moore,
I think you're forgetting

27:10.830 --> 27:12.229
I searched that garage
this morning

27:12.260 --> 27:13.818
when we were checking to see
if your wife

27:13.860 --> 27:15.225
had any hidden pills.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.091
Hard for me to imagine
I missed a gun.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.722
Well, you must have.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.738
Either that, or...

27:20.770 --> 27:22.237
What?

27:22.270 --> 27:24.158
Or someone took it.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.166
Tons of people go in and out
of that house.

27:26.210 --> 27:27.165
Domestic help,

27:27.210 --> 27:28.734
medical help.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.338
I told you before,

27:30.380 --> 27:32.109
I was at a friend's
when the murders happened.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.401
Haven't you checked that?

27:33.450 --> 27:34.439
We did. Problem is,

27:34.480 --> 27:36.016
no one else can corroborate it.

27:36.050 --> 27:38.189
And your friend let it slip
that you called him

27:38.220 --> 27:39.812
to make sure your stories
were straight,

27:39.850 --> 27:40.953
so for now,

27:40.990 --> 27:42.912
we're gonna call your alibi
"50ft."

27:43.930 --> 27:45.682
Maria and I got along fine.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.152
Just ask Ethan.

27:47.190 --> 27:48.999
We will.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.132
Okay, Ethan, good.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.762
(door closing)

27:57.840 --> 27:58.829
Good.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.374
Okay. Okay.

28:07.780 --> 28:08.815
Oh, hey.

28:08.850 --> 28:10.215
Come in.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.047
_ I didn't want to_
interrupt your se55ion.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.955
Believe me, we
are not done.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.412
I'll come back in ten,
we'll keep going.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.087
_ You still owe me for
time we need to make up.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.781
I remember.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.197
How are you doing?

28:24.230 --> 28:25.868
(chair motor whirring)

28:25.900 --> 28:27.891
It still doesn't feel real.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.158
But she'd want me
to keep going.

28:31.770 --> 28:34.034
Ethan, I'm here
because my colleagues

28:34.080 --> 28:36.139
are with your father
at his apartment.

28:36.180 --> 28:39.047
The gun that was used to kill
your mother and Dr. Krieg

28:39.080 --> 28:40.911
is registered under his name.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.783
The police are searching
for it right now.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.414
No. No, that has to be
a mistake.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.348
It's not a mistake.

28:52.290 --> 28:55.498
I can't imagine being asked
what I'm about to ask you,

28:55.530 --> 28:57.054
but if you know anything--

28:57.100 --> 28:59.762
if you heard your parents
fight recently, if you think

28:59.800 --> 29:01.859
your father was lying about
where he was yesterday...

29:01.900 --> 29:03.959
Stop.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.899
I don't think you can imagine
what it is you're asking me.

29:09.510 --> 29:12.946
My mom was everything to me.

29:12.980 --> 29:15.414
I don't leave this house.

29:16.950 --> 29:19.043
Just the people she
paid to help me.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.008
And now you're asking me
to believe that

29:23.060 --> 29:25.187
my dad is the one
who killed her?

29:27.460 --> 29:29.257
I'm alone.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.067
I need him.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.334
Wouldn't you want
to know the truth?

29:35.370 --> 29:38.134
No. And I already told you,
you're wrong. Katie!

29:39.410 --> 29:40.900
Look, I don't
know anything.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.874
I'm sorry you wasted your time,

29:42.910 --> 29:44.047
but my dad is innocent.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.047
KATIE:
Ethan,

29:45.080 --> 29:46.900
what is it?

29:46.950 --> 29:48.474
It's okay.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.414
I'm leaving.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.369
WATSON:
Did you go shopping?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.027
I had to pick up some supplies.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.937
I also stopped by the precinct.

30:08.970 --> 30:11.109
The police have now searched
Patrick Moore's home,

30:11.140 --> 30:12.562
car, office...

30:12.610 --> 30:13.975
researched
the Moore family home,

30:14.010 --> 30:15.204
the murder weapon
hasn't turned up.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.038
Nor have _the stolen
prescription pads.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.308
In my other investigation,

30:19.350 --> 30:22.274
I now believe that
the police in 1938

30:22.320 --> 30:24.982
bungled the chess club case
more than they even knew.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.443
I don't even think
the murder weapon was a knife

30:27.490 --> 30:29.981
but a piece of trophy.
In order to confirm that,

30:30.020 --> 30:32.989
I'm going to have to un-restore
Shinwell's restoration,

30:33.030 --> 30:34.622
regrettably.
Mm.

30:34.660 --> 30:35.991
What about the soldering iron?

30:36.030 --> 30:37.964
Heat softens the wood filler.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.025
It pops right out. You?

30:40.070 --> 30:43.130
I've been going over Maria
and Patrick's phone records

30:43.170 --> 30:44.637
and e-mails.

30:44.670 --> 30:47.104
I had hoped to find proof
that Patrick knew

30:47.140 --> 30:48.607
that Maria was _
at Franny Krieg's office

30:48.640 --> 30:50.039
at the time of the murders.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.149
But?

30:51.180 --> 30:52.442
Well, Marcus called

30:52.480 --> 30:54.243
right before you walked in.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.941
He said that Patrick
and his friend

30:55.980 --> 30:58.949
ordered a pizza
during the golf tournament.

30:58.990 --> 31:02.050
Delivery guy recognized Patrick
'cause he was the one who paid.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.650
So, Patrick Moore's
not our killer.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.328
What are you looking for now?

31:06.360 --> 31:08.021
Anything that stands out.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.528
Any reason why someone would
want to kill Marla.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.339
So, Shinwell

31:15.370 --> 31:17.133
and Detective Guzman met today.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.309
It went well. He's gonna
register him as a CI.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.530
May my concerns have been
for nothing.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.644
This is weird.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.257
Uh, Marla called
this same number

31:39.290 --> 31:41.622
almost two weeks ago.

31:41.660 --> 31:44.060
It's from one
of Franny Krieg's

31:44.100 --> 31:45.124
prepaid cell phones,

31:45.170 --> 31:47.297
which she set up
for the stolen IDs.

31:47.330 --> 31:50.697
Mrs. Moore called a number
of doctors at Corona General

31:50.740 --> 31:52.958
in the weeks preceding.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.671
I recognize the prefix
for their private exchange.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.177
She was doctor shopping.

31:57.210 --> 31:59.440
That's a practice
of opioid addicts.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.448
We found no evidence
that she was one, though.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.347
True, but people doctor shop
for all sorts of reasons

32:04.390 --> 32:05.982
any time they're not getting
what they want

32:06.020 --> 32:07.385
from their doctors.

32:09.990 --> 32:12.356
I just thought of something,
but I think we're gonna

32:12.390 --> 32:13.687
have to get a warrant.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.618
For?

32:15.660 --> 32:18.265
It's Dr. Krieg's medical file
on Ethan Moore.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.063
Ethan wasn't really sick.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.988
His mother was poisoning him.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.291
Come again?

32:23.340 --> 32:25.262
She was committing Munchausen
by proxy...

32:25.310 --> 32:27.062
by the looks of it,
since Ethan was a little boy.

32:27.110 --> 32:29.271
WATSON:
She was doctor shopping.

32:29.310 --> 32:31.073
She was extremely involved
in Ethan's treatments

32:31.110 --> 32:32.702
and got a lot of attention
for it.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.116
She spoke to his doctors
on a regular basis without him,

32:35.150 --> 32:37.277
and the illness itself
was a mystery.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.584
None of these things
on their own is significant,

32:39.620 --> 32:41.315
but together,
they're signs that doctors

32:41.360 --> 32:42.759
are taught to look out for.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.223
And you think
he killed her for it?

32:44.260 --> 32:45.386
And Dr. Krieg?

32:45.430 --> 32:46.658
We do.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.089
Marcus is on his way
to the house.

32:48.130 --> 32:49.995
I thought the kid had an alibi.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.292
I heard the
physical therapist

32:51.330 --> 32:53.321
say he had missed time
to make up,

32:53.370 --> 32:57.033
so it's possible he told people
he was going to the sessions,

32:59.770 --> 33:00.702
And what?
Drove himself

33:00.740 --> 33:04.141
to the doctor's office,
shot her and his mom?

33:04.180 --> 33:06.648
I thought this kid
could barely walk.
We think he had

33:06.680 --> 33:08.238
some help,
perhaps the physical therapist.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.713
We're gonna speak to her, too.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.082
Say you're right
about the motive for the mom.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.712
Why would he kill the doctor?

33:13.750 --> 33:15.581
Because she discovered
what Maria was d0ing

33:15.620 --> 33:18.020
and she told Ethan about it.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.652
So, if he had
killed only Marla,

33:19.690 --> 33:22.227
Dr. Krieg would've known
it was him.

33:22.260 --> 33:25.024
Ethan had been Dr. Krieg's
patient for over a year.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.095
She'd already ran
a battery of tests.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.064
Failed to find
a diagnosis

33:29.100 --> 33:30.795
'cause there
was no disease.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.365
Eventually, she
ran out of tests,

33:33.410 --> 33:34.809
so Maria was looking
to start all over again

33:34.840 --> 33:36.535
with a new doctor.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.071
At which point,
she unwittingly calls

33:39.110 --> 33:42.045
one of Dr. Krieg's
stolen identities,

33:42.080 --> 33:43.718
a rheumatologist at the same

33:43.750 --> 33:45.286
hospital.
Dr. Krieg's

33:45.320 --> 33:47.379
burner phones were found
at the scene of the crime.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.285
We had CCS
download voice mail.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.810
MARLA:
Dr. Gordon,

33:50.860 --> 33:52.782
my name is Maria Moore.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.752
I'm calling about my son, Ethan.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.789
He's 18.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.127
He's been in treatment

33:57.160 --> 33:58.696
since he was three,

33:58.730 --> 34:01.096
and our current doctor's
just not on the ball.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.289
At first, we were told

34:02.340 --> 34:03.466
he had juvenile arthritis,

34:03.500 --> 34:05.661
but the symptoms never added up.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.770
She told Dr. Krieg
the symptoms started at six.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.074
She never mentioned
juvenile arthritis.

34:11.110 --> 34:12.839
So, her story was changing.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.110
We think that's what tipped
Dr. Krieg off.

34:15.150 --> 34:17.471
Now, in her
calendar, she had

34:17.520 --> 34:20.080
two more meetings
involving the Moores.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.109
The first one

34:21.160 --> 34:23.617
was a week before the murders.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.355
In her notes,
she says

34:25.390 --> 34:27.119
that she visited
with Ethan alone,

34:27.160 --> 34:28.821
asking the mother
to wait outside

34:28.860 --> 34:31.328
while she shared
her discovery.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.792
So, the mom is abusing her kid.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.229
Why not call
Protective Services?

34:34.270 --> 34:35.737
Ethan's 18.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.204
She decided to talk to him
as an adult.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.400
Given the events
that followed,

34:39.440 --> 34:41.169
you could
imagine how she

34:41.210 --> 34:42.472
shared her awareness

34:42.510 --> 34:44.569
of Marla's message on
another doctor's voice mail.

34:44.610 --> 34:47.170
Perhaps it was the only way
to gain Ethan's trust,

34:47.210 --> 34:49.542
reveal her criminal activities,
and explain

34:49.580 --> 34:53.482
that Marla had inadvertently
called one of her aliases.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.488
The final meeting...

34:55.520 --> 34:57.408
was the day
they were both murdered.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.223
(cell phone rings)

35:00.790 --> 35:02.121
Hey, the captain's here, too.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.195
BELL:
Something tells me

35:03.230 --> 35:05.221
you were right
about Ethan Moore.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.761
According to the housekeeper,
he was real upset last night

35:07.800 --> 35:09.290
after we finished
the second search.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.258
wouldn't talk to anyone.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.265
About a half hour later,

35:13.310 --> 35:14.129
she heard a car pick him up

35:14.180 --> 35:15.169
and drive away.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.177
Didn't see who got him

35:16.210 --> 35:17.234
or the car.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.271
No one's heard from him since.

35:19.310 --> 35:21.141
Ethan is gone.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.688
WATSON:
Sherlock.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.482
I'm here.

35:33.530 --> 35:36.499
Are you done redestroying
the table?

35:36.530 --> 35:38.521
Decided not to, actually.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.390
Got better use for it as is.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.261
Marcus and I just
finished interviewing

35:42.300 --> 35:43.369
the rest of the Moore staff.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.503
No one knew anything.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.700
Physical therapist?

35:45.740 --> 35:47.264
She was on a Skype call
with her boyfriend

35:47.310 --> 35:48.277
at the time
of the murders.

35:48.310 --> 35:49.379
Her phone's geolocation

35:49.410 --> 35:51.207
puts her at Ethan's house.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.808
Now, when Marcus spoke
to her the other day,

35:52.850 --> 35:54.317
she confirmed Ethan's alibi,

35:54.350 --> 35:57.171
but the truth is,
Ethan canceled the session

35:57.220 --> 35:59.211
right when she got to the house.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.559
So, she stuck around to adjust
some of the equipment.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.615
She just assumed he was upstairs
the whole time.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.924
So, the search
for Ethan's accomplice,

36:05.960 --> 36:08.349
and by extension Ethan himself,
continues.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.288
Agent Ritter just sent
this over.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.218
After we discovered the murders,

36:12.270 --> 36:13.259
he broadened his alert

36:13.300 --> 36:14.631
so that pharmacies

36:14.670 --> 36:16.262
would report the scripts

36:16.300 --> 36:18.461
from Franny Krieg
and the other doctors.

36:19.470 --> 36:20.562
These are where users

36:20.610 --> 36:21.770
either filled their scripts

36:21.810 --> 36:22.970
off the bogus pads,

36:23.010 --> 36:24.807
or tried to,
and were stopped.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.249
His idea

36:26.280 --> 36:27.907
of a peace offering.
He wants me to know

36:27.950 --> 36:29.247
the DEA's net is working.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.713
We should send Agent Ritter

36:30.750 --> 36:32.342
something very nice in return.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.255
I don't think
it's that big a deal.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.086
You don't at the moment,

36:36.120 --> 36:38.486
but you're about
to change your mind.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.883
This dot...

36:39.930 --> 36:41.227
is dated the night
of the murders,

36:41.260 --> 36:43.399
just before 7:00 pm.
in Fort Lee.

36:43.430 --> 36:45.967
And that's meaningful
because...?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.991
Well, we're looking
for Ethan's accomplice.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.258
You know it's
not his father,

36:49.300 --> 36:50.460
his physical therapist,

36:50.500 --> 36:53.333
or anyone
on the household staff.

36:53.370 --> 36:55.907
Ethan was a virtual shut-in...

36:55.940 --> 36:57.635
so where else could
he have met someone

36:57.680 --> 36:59.443
to enlist in a double homicide?

37:00.450 --> 37:03.010
Um... his doctor's office.

37:03.050 --> 37:06.247
_ He said he met an_addict
in Franny Krieg's waiting room.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.985
Maybe that wasn't
entirely made up?

37:08.020 --> 37:10.011
The stolen pads
have never been recovered.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.381
Whether Ethan intended them
as payment

37:12.430 --> 37:14.557
or whether his accomplice
just helped themselves

37:14.600 --> 37:17.296
to them, either way,
they could've been

37:17.330 --> 37:19.924
incentive to participate
in a murder.

37:19.970 --> 37:22.530
What does an addict do
when they find themselves

37:22.570 --> 37:25.004
with a cache
of blank prescriptions?

37:25.040 --> 37:28.430
He fills one_
as soon as p055ible.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.368
Perhaps in this case,
the night of the murders

37:30.410 --> 37:32.275
after dropping Ethan home.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.676
The first pharmacy

37:34.720 --> 37:36.745
across the George
Washington Bridge.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.314
Can I have a few minutes?

37:43.360 --> 37:45.351
Thanks.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.519
I asked if I could speak
with you alone,

37:49.560 --> 37:50.527
but you are not obligated

37:50.560 --> 37:52.369
to say anything back.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.330
How did they find me?

37:55.370 --> 37:57.292
Todd Fisher,
the addict who helped you,

37:57.340 --> 37:59.968
gave us the name of the hotel
where he dropped you off.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.469
He also confessed
to drivmg you to and from

38:04.510 --> 38:06.671
Franny Krieg's office
the day of the murders.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.349
We also found
your father's gun

38:09.380 --> 38:11.644
in your hotel room.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.612
I found out some information

38:15.660 --> 38:18.356
that I thought
you might want to know.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.620
I had an idea where your mother
got those drugs

38:20.660 --> 38:22.548
she was giving you
all those years.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.091
Now, your
grandfather, Sam,

38:25.130 --> 38:27.098
was on a _whole list
of medications

38:27.130 --> 38:30.634
for his heart, blood pressure,
thyroid...

38:30.670 --> 38:33.332
anti-seizure meds.

38:33.370 --> 38:34.871
His staff knew
for a long time

38:34.910 --> 38:36.400
that pills were going missing.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.805
They even fired a nurse
over it once,

38:37.840 --> 38:39.808
thinking it was her.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.977
Never in a million years
would they have thought

38:42.020 --> 38:46.309
his daughter was stealing them
to poison her own son.

38:47.690 --> 38:49.988
And these explain
all my symptoms?

38:50.020 --> 38:51.419
We won't know for sure

38:51.460 --> 38:54.588
which ones she gave you
until you're tested...

38:54.630 --> 38:58.054
but a number of them can trigger
the immune system to go haywire.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.592
All the signs of an
autoimmune disease show up.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.064
Antibodies in the blood,
the swelling, the joint pain...

39:05.110 --> 39:07.362
everything except a cause.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.935
The effects should
be temporary.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.107
Now that you're not
taking them anymore,

39:12.150 --> 39:14.471
your symptoms should improve.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.146
Will you talk to the police
for me?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.408
About what?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.781
Tell them you understand
why I did it.

39:25.690 --> 39:26.987
What she did to me.

39:28.730 --> 39:31.051
She stole my life.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.760
Here's what I understand.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.964
Franny Krieg was selling illegal
prescriptions to addicts.

39:41.010 --> 39:43.433
If she was caught,
she would've gone to prison,

39:43.480 --> 39:45.698
but somewhere in there
she was still a phySICIan

39:45.750 --> 39:47.149
and you were her patient.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.546
She tried _to throw
you a lifeline

39:49.580 --> 39:51.445
and tell you what
your mother was doing.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.017
She had to know
what she was risking,

39:55.060 --> 39:58.689
but she tried to save you anyway
and you killed her for it.

40:13.840 --> 40:18.448
* Are we just now
until we start again? *

40:20.680 --> 40:23.046
* We travel alone

40:23.080 --> 40:26.811
* This is not the end

40:26.850 --> 40:30.251
* Follow that road

40:34.130 --> 40:35.529
* Follow that road...

40:35.560 --> 40:38.097
Wow.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.098
You could've just said,
"No, thank you."

40:42.140 --> 40:44.563
Uh, I brought it here
because I think

40:44.610 --> 40:47.534
we're gonna have to spend
more time together.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.232
So consider the table
on indefinite loan.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.999
Hmm, and how many games
you figure we'll get in,

40:53.050 --> 40:56.076
what with how soon you think
I'll be dead and all?

40:56.120 --> 40:59.180
Watson told me you were going to
continue with Detective Guzman.

40:59.220 --> 41:00.517
I can't stop you.

41:00.550 --> 41:03.053
I have a proposal.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.524
You turned down Watson's offer
once that she, uh,

41:05.560 --> 41:06.982
train you to be a detective.

41:07.030 --> 41:08.258
(chuckles)

41:08.290 --> 41:09.791
I offer now, instead,

41:09.830 --> 41:12.196
that we train you to be
an informant.

41:12.230 --> 41:15.028
We can teach you the skills
you require to, uh,

41:15.070 --> 41:16.662
survive that undertaking:

41:16.700 --> 41:20.534
skills of deception,
avoiding detection...

41:20.570 --> 41:22.538
how to extract _information
Without the subject knowmg

41:22.580 --> 41:23.774
they're being questioned.

41:23.810 --> 41:26.506
And I pay
for this schooling how?

41:26.550 --> 41:28.177
By getting beat at chess?

41:28.210 --> 41:31.509
Every now and then,
Watson and I have our own need

41:31.550 --> 41:34.951
of a pair of eyes on the street.

41:34.990 --> 41:38.528
So, in addition to your official
capacity with the NYPD,

41:38.560 --> 41:41.279
you'll also unofficially
be our informant, as well.

41:41.330 --> 41:42.957
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh,ooh,ooh”.*

41:43.000 --> 41:46.219
Do you accept the proposal?

41:46.270 --> 41:48.022
* Owns a map

41:48.070 --> 41:53.007
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh,ooh,ooh”.*

41:56.340 --> 41:58.649
Let's see what you got.

42:02.620 --> 42:06.943
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... *
