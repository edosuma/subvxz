(Yelling)
Hello!

00:09.461 --> 00:12.096
We have a map,
we know what area it is!

00:12.163 --> 00:13.097

<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Remember the horse?</i>

00:19.771 --> 00:21.637
How I got that arrow
out of his neck?

00:21.705 --> 00:23.372
<i>That's what you have to do.</i>

<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Scott!</i>

<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I thought I was gonna die.</i>

00:38.320 --> 00:40.956
And then
there was this wolf...

00:41.023 --> 00:43.024
He just stayed there

00:43.092 --> 00:44.159
and watched us
all night.

Sorry,
did I wake you up?

01:26.732 --> 01:29.501
I've heard you up
almost every night this week.

01:29.568 --> 01:31.003
Is everything okay?

01:31.070 --> 01:33.738
Yeah, fine.
I was just thirsty.

<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Listen, Ty.</i>

01:39.312 --> 01:41.478
I'm heading off
for the weekend,

01:41.546 --> 01:43.614
gonna try and get
a little fishing in

01:43.682 --> 01:44.615
before the end
of the season.

01:44.683 --> 01:45.582
You should come along.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.651
Uh... I don't know,
I-

01:47.719 --> 01:48.752
You look like a man

01:48.821 --> 01:52.523
who could use
a change of scenery.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.391
Well,
just think about it.

01:54.459 --> 01:57.760
Oh, and uh,
Scott called last night,

01:58.696 --> 01:59.830
again.

02:00.698 --> 02:01.664

how you're doing.

Is this top speed?

02:15.912 --> 02:17.313
Huh?

02:17.380 --> 02:20.883
Can you maybe pick up the pace
a little bit?!

02:21.484 --> 02:24.419
Amy: Oh, what?!
I'm sorry, am I boring you?

02:24.487 --> 02:25.988
Maybe you should
put another quarter in him,

02:26.056 --> 02:27.223
like one of those
plastic ponies

02:27.290 --> 02:28.224
at the mall.

02:28.291 --> 02:29.290
(Laughs)
No kidding!

02:29.358 --> 02:30.058
His owners bought him
at an auction

02:30.125 --> 02:31.326
to use as a trail horse,

02:31.393 --> 02:34.695
but Neon's not too interested
in being ridden.

02:34.763 --> 02:35.696
You think you have
a couple minutes

02:35.764 --> 02:36.965
to give me a hand?

02:37.032 --> 02:37.966
Uh, sorry,
I've got a phone meeting

02:38.033 --> 02:39.433
with my student advisor
right now,

02:39.501 --> 02:41.769
but maybe later?

02:41.837 --> 02:43.537
So you've, uh...

02:43.605 --> 02:45.873
You've made a decision
about university?

02:45.940 --> 02:47.407
Well, I've missed
the first few classes,

02:47.475 --> 02:50.978
but, you know,
my plans haven't changed.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.246
That's good.

02:52.313 --> 02:53.480
I'm sure you'll have
no problem catching up.

02:58.253 --> 02:59.386
(Neon snorts)

03:01.755 --> 03:04.556
Amy: There you go, Neon.
Good boy.

03:05.692 --> 03:07.760

you've been saying

You just scared me, Amy,

Grandpa says you haven't been
sleeping at night.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.538
He's worried about you, Ty,
and so am I.

04:31.606 --> 04:33.307
Worried about what?

04:33.375 --> 04:35.943
You guys are making
a big deal out of nothing.

04:36.011 --> 04:37.077
I haven't been sleeping

04:37.144 --> 04:38.778
because I'm worried
about school.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.847
Okay?
That's all.

04:41.983 --> 04:43.116
Okay...

04:45.252 --> 04:47.187
Land and country magazine.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.822
They've got a worldwide
readership in the millions,

04:49.890 --> 04:52.125
and they've done features on
all the big name properties:

04:52.193 --> 04:53.993
Banff Springs,
Monticello,

04:54.060 --> 04:55.127
Sissinghurst.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.796
Sissinghurst?
Wow...

04:56.864 --> 04:58.397
Mock all you want,
Dad,

04:58.465 --> 04:59.632
but one of the editors

04:59.700 --> 05:00.933
stayed at the dude ranch
last weekend

05:01.001 --> 05:03.035
and completely fell in love
with the place,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.537
and now they wanna do
a feature on us

05:04.605 --> 05:05.505
for the winter issue.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.739
- You're kidding.
- Yep!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.407
The photographer'll be here
Sunday.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.774
Sunday? That only gives us
a few days

05:09.842 --> 05:11.175
to clean up
the dude ranch!

05:11.243 --> 05:13.044
Dad, why don't you
let me handle it, okay?

05:13.112 --> 05:14.445
PR is more my department.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.715
Oh! We should get
a photo of Jack!

05:16.782 --> 05:20.051
<i>He's our very own</i>
<i>ancient relic of the West!</i>

05:20.119 --> 05:21.386
That's a good one,
Tim,

05:21.453 --> 05:22.888
but in a few hours

05:22.955 --> 05:24.890
I'm gonna be dropping
this little caddis

05:24.957 --> 05:26.456
into my favourite stretch
of river,

05:26.525 --> 05:29.092
so nothing you can say
is gonna ruin my day.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.028
Hey, Dad, why don't you
go with Grandpa?

05:31.095 --> 05:32.496

Now, Lou, I don't want-

05:32.564 --> 05:34.798
No! I-it's almost
the end of the season,

05:34.866 --> 05:36.867
next month you're gonna be
busy weaning calves,

05:39.203 --> 05:40.838

- Don't you need me?
- I got it, don't worry.

05:43.407 --> 05:45.642
What do you say, Jack?
Huh?

05:46.544 --> 05:50.279

06:05.294 --> 06:06.494

There's something
I've been meaning

06:07.363 --> 06:08.163
to talk to you about.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.866
Um... do you have time

06:10.934 --> 06:12.300
to grab a coffee
or something?

06:12.368 --> 06:14.401
Uh, maybe another time.

06:14.469 --> 06:16.070
I'm heading off fishing,

06:16.137 --> 06:18.105
and I've got a lot
of running around to do.

06:20.042 --> 06:21.776
Fly fisherman, huh?

06:21.843 --> 06:22.977
Yeah.

06:23.045 --> 06:24.712
Yeah, me too.

06:24.780 --> 06:25.980
You know, I've been...

06:26.048 --> 06:27.181
Meaning to get out
on the bow

06:27.248 --> 06:28.816
or the Highwood
for a while now.

06:28.884 --> 06:30.016
Uh huh.

06:31.886 --> 06:35.088
I've got the whole
weekend off, too.

06:35.155 --> 06:37.156
Where are you headed?

06:38.492 --> 06:41.027
Sweep porches,
distribute pumpkins,

06:41.095 --> 06:42.228
<i>Lou,</i>
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

06:42.296 --> 06:43.630

06:43.698 --> 06:45.965
Fine.
Give your list to Mallory.

06:46.032 --> 06:47.399
Sorry, I can't.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.434
I'm spending the weekend
at my friend Jamie's house.

06:49.502 --> 06:51.003
It's all you,
cowboy.

06:52.072 --> 06:53.872
How am I supposed to get
all of this done on my own?

06:53.940 --> 06:55.140
Relax.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.308
Peter's gonna be here
this weekend

06:56.375 --> 06:58.043

to give me a hand.

06:58.111 --> 06:59.778
Caleb:
Yeah, right.

07:01.414 --> 07:02.614

07:02.681 --> 07:04.482
Honey, fishing season's
almost over.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.050
It's now or never.

07:06.118 --> 07:09.020
Yeah, but this was supposed
to be our weekend together!

07:09.088 --> 07:10.387
Hey,

07:10.455 --> 07:11.956
you are the one who said

07:12.024 --> 07:13.190
I should get to know your dad
and grandfather better,

07:13.258 --> 07:15.660
- right?
- Fine.

07:15.728 --> 07:17.394
Just don't bring home
a big stinky trout

07:17.462 --> 07:18.795
and expect me
to gut it!

07:18.863 --> 07:19.997
Okay.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.265
Thanks,
I knew you'd understand.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.735

one more thing...

07:25.802 --> 07:27.237
If you don't mind,

07:27.304 --> 07:30.206
can you take this guy
for the weekend, please?

07:30.274 --> 07:31.674
I tried to take him
camping once before

07:31.742 --> 07:32.775
and it was
a total disaster.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.010
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Sure. Max.</i>

07:35.077 --> 07:36.111

Says it's the best late season
fishing in the country.

<i>Have to have</i>
<i>the most expensive rod.</i>

<i>Peter:</i> <i>You know,</i>
<i>back in university,</i>

08:01.903 --> 08:04.805
I used to work in the summers
as a fishing guide.

08:04.873 --> 08:07.340
Noticed the exact
same thing.

08:09.843 --> 08:12.045
Well, Jack wouldn't take
no for an answer, so...

08:12.112 --> 08:14.113
- I'll be back Sunday.
- Ty?

08:15.049 --> 08:16.949
Just be careful,
okay?

08:19.019 --> 08:20.153
<i>(Horn honking)</i>

08:20.221 --> 08:21.555

All right?

08:23.923 --> 08:25.724
- I'll see you when you get back.
- Okay.

08:26.660 --> 08:29.395
<i>Ty:</i> <i>All right,</i> <i>i'm coming!</i>

Put your stuff in the back.

08:35.101 --> 08:36.902
We're finally ready
to go!

08:36.969 --> 08:38.503
So you girls have
a good weekend.

08:38.571 --> 08:41.673
Grandpa,
no fighting with Dad, okay?

08:41.740 --> 08:43.039
I don't want Peter
to know

08:43.107 --> 08:45.176
how dysfunctional
this family really is.

08:45.244 --> 08:47.378
Mallory: Don't you think
he's figured it out by now?

08:47.446 --> 08:48.713
Jack:
See ya!

08:48.780 --> 08:49.947
Amy: Catch a big one
for us, Grandpa.

08:50.015 --> 08:53.617
<i>Lou: Bye, Peter!</i>
<i>Peter: See ya, Lou!</i>

08:53.685 --> 08:54.885

08:54.953 --> 08:57.554
My mom says a fishing pole's
a long stick

08:57.622 --> 08:59.724
with a hook on one end
and a fool on the other.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.025

<i>Ashley:</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

09:08.498 --> 09:09.899
Is it quitting time yet?

09:10.601 --> 09:12.435
Lou's got me working
a double shift.

09:12.502 --> 09:13.737
Ashley:
Oh, that's too bad.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.072
Because I've got
the whole night off.

09:16.140 --> 09:20.408
Well, I've always got time
for a quick break.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.145
Caleb, I don't wanna be
your quick anything.

09:23.213 --> 09:25.247
If you and I are gonna
make this work,

09:25.314 --> 09:27.315
I want you to take me
out on a date.

09:27.383 --> 09:29.284
So like dinner
and a movie?

09:29.352 --> 09:30.518
I'm hoping you can be

09:30.586 --> 09:32.287
a little more creative
than that!

09:32.355 --> 09:33.789
(Laughs)

09:33.857 --> 09:36.090
Give me a call when, um,
you have the night off.

09:39.895 --> 09:41.262
Hey, Ash.

09:41.329 --> 09:44.465
<i>What's your favourite flower?</i>

09:44.532 --> 09:46.734
Well, if we're gonna do
this whole dating thing,

09:46.802 --> 09:50.271
I figure I should probably
do it right.

09:50.338 --> 09:51.905
Surprise me.

10:05.653 --> 10:07.553
(Trucks rumble to a stop)

10:13.860 --> 10:14.927
(Doors slam)

10:17.931 --> 10:19.031
Jack: You better know
where you're going,

10:19.099 --> 10:20.666
it's getting late!

10:20.733 --> 10:23.269
Tim: Stumpy says it's about
an hour hike from here.

10:23.336 --> 10:25.036
It would have been nice
to know that.

10:25.104 --> 10:28.907
I'm not exactly ready to trek
into the back country here.

10:28.974 --> 10:32.210
<i>I knew I never should have</i>
<i>let you pick the spot!</i>

10:32.278 --> 10:33.744
Where's your sense
of spirit, Jack?

10:33.813 --> 10:35.280
I left it at home,

10:35.347 --> 10:37.715
along with my good sense!

10:37.783 --> 10:39.750
Well, you'll be thankin' me
when we're reelin' 'em in.

10:39.818 --> 10:41.718
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Yeah, we damn
well</i> <i>better be!</i>

10:41.786 --> 10:43.553
Just get your little
yellow cooler,

10:43.621 --> 10:45.488
and let's go, buddy.

10:45.556 --> 10:47.624
Grab that shotgun.

10:53.331 --> 10:55.098
You planning on shooting
the fish there, Jack?

10:55.166 --> 10:59.168
This happens to be
prime grizzly country.

11:01.338 --> 11:02.805
You comin'?

11:04.774 --> 11:05.842
Yeah.

11:10.113 --> 11:11.314
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>You're cute, Max.</i>

11:11.381 --> 11:12.848
But how am I gonna get
anything done

11:12.915 --> 11:14.349
with you underfoot?

11:14.416 --> 11:15.416
If you want,
I can look after him.

11:15.484 --> 11:17.452
I don't have any plans tonight.

11:17.519 --> 11:18.720
You know what?

11:18.787 --> 11:20.521
Max is gonna be
just fine tonight.

11:20.589 --> 11:22.623
Me and you are going
for dinner.

11:22.691 --> 11:24.059
If the boys
can have a weekend away,

11:24.126 --> 11:26.561
we deserve
a girls night out.

11:26.628 --> 11:27.595
Girls night out?

11:27.663 --> 11:29.196
I'm in.

11:29.264 --> 11:30.597
Aren't you supposed to be
at a friend's house?

11:30.665 --> 11:31.999
Lou: Yeah...
Mallory: Change of plans.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.735
Jamie had a family thing,
so I'm all yours.

11:34.802 --> 11:35.970
Well, great.

11:36.037 --> 11:37.437
So where do you girls
feel like eating?

11:37.505 --> 11:40.174
Maggie's, Maggie's,
or Maggie's?

11:40.242 --> 11:42.076
Um... Maggie's?

11:42.143 --> 11:43.210
(Laughs)

11:46.446 --> 11:48.915
(Flys buzz,
birds chirp)

11:53.354 --> 11:54.687
(Insects drone)

11:57.958 --> 12:00.792
Jack: This'll do.
We'll camp here.

12:00.860 --> 12:03.295
And let's move fast,
'cause we're losing daylight.

12:03.363 --> 12:04.930
I'll grab
some firewood.

12:04.998 --> 12:07.132
Ty:
I'll set up the tarp.

12:09.635 --> 12:11.736
Now, listen, Tim,

12:11.804 --> 12:13.538
I uh...

12:13.606 --> 12:15.740
I promised Lou
that I'd make an effort

12:15.808 --> 12:18.042
to get along with you
this weekend,

12:18.110 --> 12:19.310
<i>and the only way</i>
<i>that's gonna happen</i>

12:19.378 --> 12:21.245
is if we have
separate quarters.

12:21.313 --> 12:22.413
So...

12:22.480 --> 12:23.747
So?

12:23.815 --> 12:25.149
So, I bunk with Ty,
and-

12:25.217 --> 12:27.751
No, I am not sleeping
in a tent with PW.

12:27.819 --> 12:29.653
Not a chance!

12:29.721 --> 12:30.754
I barely know the guy,

12:30.822 --> 12:32.622
and from what I do know
of him, I don't like him.

12:32.689 --> 12:33.823
(Scoffs) Maybe this
is your opportunity

12:33.891 --> 12:35.491
- No!
- to get to know him better!

12:35.559 --> 12:37.294
Ain't gonna happen, Jack.
Then you can sleep outside!

12:37.361 --> 12:38.428
- I will!
- Fine.

12:39.397 --> 12:40.463
Fine.

12:42.366 --> 12:44.167
Oh, look.
The special is trout.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.002
Peter could've saved himself
the trip.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.370
(Amy and Mallory laugh)

12:47.438 --> 12:48.570
I'm just getting
the waffle deluxe;

12:48.638 --> 12:50.239
That's what Ty and I
always get.

12:50.307 --> 12:51.540
Okay, ladies, seriously,

12:51.607 --> 12:52.641
if we're gonna have
a girls night out,

12:52.708 --> 12:53.675
there needs to be rules

12:53.743 --> 12:55.177
like no talking about boys.

12:55.245 --> 12:56.545
Do you really think
they're in the forest

12:56.612 --> 12:57.913
<i>talking about you?</i>

12:57.981 --> 12:59.648
No, they're probably too busy
comparing the size

12:59.715 --> 13:00.782
of their fishing rods.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.052
Okay,
I've got another rule.

13:03.119 --> 13:04.218
We order whatever we want,

13:04.286 --> 13:06.120
and no salads allowed!

13:06.188 --> 13:07.788
First rule
of "girls night out" is,

13:07.856 --> 13:09.757
you do not talk about
"girls night out"!

13:09.825 --> 13:10.891
(All laugh)

13:13.862 --> 13:14.929
(Girls chattering)

13:15.897 --> 13:17.365
Mallory, what's wrong?

13:17.433 --> 13:19.667
I can't believe it,
I got ditched.

13:19.734 --> 13:21.368
What?

13:21.436 --> 13:24.037
That's Jamie over there
with those girls from school.

13:24.105 --> 13:27.074
She said she had
a family thing.

13:27.141 --> 13:28.241
Don't look!

13:28.309 --> 13:30.143
I don't want them
to see me.

13:30.211 --> 13:33.380
Well, you can't hide behind
your menu all night, Mallory.

13:33.448 --> 13:36.682
Don't worry, I know how to deal
with little witches like that.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.384
(Big fake laugh)

13:38.452 --> 13:41.620
Oh! Oh my God, Mallory,
you are so funny!

13:42.522 --> 13:43.722
You have to laugh, too,

13:43.790 --> 13:44.991
make them think we're having
a good time.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.293
(Lou and Amy laugh louy)

13:49.296 --> 13:51.163
I gotta get out of here.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.638
Ugh!
(Spitting)

14:02.074 --> 14:03.774
(Grunting and groaning)

14:03.842 --> 14:05.910
(Tent zipper buzzes open)

14:07.813 --> 14:09.513
Hey, Tim, you know,
you change your mind,

14:09.580 --> 14:12.316
like, seriously,
I got lots of room in here.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.051
I'm fine.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.085
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

14:15.153 --> 14:16.353
'Cause, you know,

14:16.421 --> 14:19.323
you look a little
uncomfortable there.

14:20.258 --> 14:22.159
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>I said I'm fine!</i>

14:22.227 --> 14:23.793
All right.
Good night.

14:24.794 --> 14:26.362
(Tent zips closed)

14:30.434 --> 14:31.767
(Fire crackles)

14:35.072 --> 14:36.305
(Low, menacing growl)

14:40.943 --> 14:42.010
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Aaagh!</i>

14:42.945 --> 14:44.612
(Threaning growl)

14:46.615 --> 14:48.250
(Gasps)

14:48.317 --> 14:50.552
Easy, now.
Time to get up.

14:52.721 --> 14:53.788
Okay.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.191
I'll be out in a second.

14:57.259 --> 14:58.426
Well,
don't take too long.

14:58.493 --> 15:02.263
These fish aren't gonna be
rising all day.

15:14.554 --> 15:15.655
All right, I'm here.

15:15.722 --> 15:17.757
What did you wanna tell me?

15:17.824 --> 15:19.991
I really did have
a family thi last night.

15:20.058 --> 15:21.726
But it got cancelled.

15:21.794 --> 15:22.960
And then Rachel called

15:23.028 --> 15:24.396
and said she wanted
to hang out.

15:24.463 --> 15:26.531
I mean,
can you believe it?

15:26.599 --> 15:30.001
That's great, Jamie.
I'm happy for you.

15:30.068 --> 15:32.937
Well, maybe Rachel
will call you too.

15:33.005 --> 15:35.071
I'm not gonna hold
my breath.

15:35.139 --> 15:37.708
Mallory,
d-don't be mad.

15:38.677 --> 15:40.010
We're in high school now.

15:40.077 --> 15:43.146
Things are just different,
you know?

15:44.649 --> 15:46.183
I'm really sorry.

15:47.118 --> 15:48.251
Me too.

16:01.365 --> 16:03.333
Hey, your casting's
coming along.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.568
<i>Just remember your timing.</i>

16:06.636 --> 16:08.704
Let the line load.

16:11.941 --> 16:13.007
That's good.

16:14.344 --> 16:17.479
Well, maybe I'll actually
catch something.

16:17.547 --> 16:19.180
Jack:
Well, you know,

16:20.115 --> 16:23.617
fly fishing isn't really about
catching fish.

16:23.685 --> 16:27.187
It's about taking
a little time,

16:27.255 --> 16:30.157
putting things
into perspective.

16:30.225 --> 16:33.160
Fishing also about talking?

16:33.228 --> 16:35.963
Only if you
want it to be.

16:36.030 --> 16:39.366
Ty: In that case,
I'd rather just fish.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.873
Peter:
Morning, Jack.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.909
Jack: Well, look who
decided to get out of bed!

16:49.977 --> 16:51.578
Tim: Oh, you always gotta
be first in the water,

16:51.645 --> 16:53.179
don't ya, Jack?

16:53.247 --> 16:54.480
Jack:
You're damn right!

16:54.547 --> 16:55.814
Been here
more than an hour,

16:55.882 --> 16:57.883
<i>i've tried three</i>
<i>different patterns,</i>

16:57.950 --> 16:59.184
<i>not even a nibble!</i>

16:59.252 --> 17:01.119
You sure there's fish
in this river?

17:01.187 --> 17:02.921
Well, Stumpy swore
on his good leg

17:02.989 --> 17:05.223
that it was teeming
with rainbow.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.792
Hey, I borrowed your coffee cup,
thanks.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.900
Mallory: Why can't
Neon go any faster?

17:15.967 --> 17:18.569
Amy: Well, he can,
he just won't.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.438
It doesn't make
any sense to me.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.440
I mean, he's a perfectly
healthy horse,

17:22.508 --> 17:25.142
and as far as I can tell,
he's intelligent.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.910
He's just not living up
to his potential.

17:26.977 --> 17:28.879
Neon's a slacker.

17:28.946 --> 17:30.847
I guess you're right.

17:31.783 --> 17:34.217
You know, Mallory,
you don't have to stay here.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.352
I know Lou isn't paying you
this weekend.

17:36.421 --> 17:37.754
It's okay.

17:37.822 --> 17:38.988
It's not like I have anything
better to do anyway.

17:39.056 --> 17:40.223
You know, on account
of being ditched

17:40.291 --> 17:41.991
by my so called friend.

17:42.059 --> 17:44.627
Yeah,
that kinda sucked.

17:44.694 --> 17:45.828
Yeah, well,

17:45.896 --> 17:47.029
the rules are different
in high school.

17:47.096 --> 17:49.331
Those girls Jamie was with,
they're popular.

17:49.399 --> 17:50.866
Everyone wants to hang out
with them.

17:50.934 --> 17:52.635
If I were Jamie,
I would've ditched me, too.

17:52.702 --> 17:54.637
You know,
it's survival of the fittest.

17:54.704 --> 17:57.139
(Cow moos,
Neon snorts repeatedly)

17:58.074 --> 17:59.273
Wow...

17:59.341 --> 18:00.675
What's going on, Neon?

18:00.743 --> 18:02.076
(Neon whinnies)

18:03.211 --> 18:04.345
I've never seen Neon
so excited!

18:04.413 --> 18:05.513
Amy:
Whoa!

18:07.450 --> 18:09.183
Yeah,
he loves cows!

18:11.053 --> 18:13.054
<i>(Laughs)</i>
<i>Awesome!</i>

18:14.722 --> 18:17.724
<i>This guy's a cuttin' horse.</i>

18:18.660 --> 18:19.726
(Laughs)

18:20.762 --> 18:22.830
Come on!
(Clucks tongue)

18:26.734 --> 18:29.302
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>How's it goin', Jack?</i>

18:29.370 --> 18:30.970
Fine.

18:31.037 --> 18:32.805
Listen, um,

18:32.873 --> 18:33.940
there's something
I've been...

18:34.007 --> 18:34.841
Meaning to talk
to you about.

18:34.908 --> 18:36.308
Uh...

18:36.376 --> 18:38.310
Just hasn't really been
a chance to...

18:39.245 --> 18:41.213
Oh, come on.
Spit it out.

18:42.516 --> 18:44.316
(Clears throat)

18:46.619 --> 18:49.988
Um, I've always been
kind of a...

18:50.055 --> 18:52.023
Traditional guy,
I guess, so...

18:52.091 --> 18:53.157
<i>I wanted you to know</i>

18:53.225 --> 18:56.661
what my intentions are
with Lou.

18:56.729 --> 18:58.563
What I'm saying is,

18:59.499 --> 19:01.666
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

19:03.602 --> 19:07.404
<i>And I sure would appreciate</i>
<i>your blessing.</i>

19:07.472 --> 19:09.573
Well...

19:09.641 --> 19:11.174
Thing is, Peter,

19:12.110 --> 19:14.311
Lou's not much
for tradition,

19:15.246 --> 19:17.180
and I doubt she'd care
whether or not

19:17.248 --> 19:19.849
you had her grandfather's
blessing.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.183
(Unsure chuckle)

19:21.251 --> 19:23.152
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>But, for what it's worth,</i>

19:23.220 --> 19:27.223
if Lou says yes,
if she figures you're the one,

19:30.193 --> 19:32.896
I guess she could do
a whole lot worse than you.

19:37.867 --> 19:38.934
Caleb:
Yeah.

19:39.903 --> 19:42.504
It's just getting expensive.

19:42.572 --> 19:43.872
(Sighs heavily)

19:43.940 --> 19:45.073
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Plus, it's a four day trip.</i>

19:45.141 --> 19:46.642
Lou:
Caleb, you know those pumpkins

19:46.709 --> 19:48.443
aren't going
to distribute themselves!

19:48.511 --> 19:49.778
Things are just busy
around here.

19:49.846 --> 19:50.912
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>if I could get a ride later,</i>

19:50.979 --> 19:52.112
<i>then yeah.</i>

19:52.180 --> 19:53.147
<i>I don't know.</i>

19:53.214 --> 19:54.381
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Stay, Max.</i>

19:54.449 --> 19:55.449
<i>Stay!</i>

19:58.453 --> 20:01.055
Hi, Caleb's cell phone
privileges have been suspended

20:01.122 --> 20:02.890
for the rest of the day.
Thanks!

20:02.958 --> 20:04.224
So what,
you're my mother now?

20:04.292 --> 20:06.226
Lou:
No, I'm the boss!

20:06.294 --> 20:07.527
And unlike your mom,

20:07.595 --> 20:09.195
<i>I don't find you charming</i>
<i>or cute!</i>

20:09.263 --> 20:10.864
My affection for you
is based purely

20:10.932 --> 20:13.033
on your pumpkin
distribution skills.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.067
Now, get to work!

20:14.134 --> 20:15.435
Relax, I'm on it.

20:15.502 --> 20:17.103
Oh, and by the way,
I saw a bunch of Dad's cows

20:17.171 --> 20:18.705
grazing along
our property line,

20:18.773 --> 20:20.306
so can you please
make sure

20:20.374 --> 20:22.042
you check the fences.

20:22.109 --> 20:23.042
Uh, Lou?

20:23.109 --> 20:24.242
(Max whimpers and barks)

20:24.310 --> 20:25.844
Oh my God! Max!

20:27.681 --> 20:28.747
(Tree rustles)

20:31.317 --> 20:32.718
(Sighs heavily)

20:43.862 --> 20:44.963
(Low growling)

20:48.266 --> 20:49.100
Peter: Any luck?
Ty: (Gasps)

20:49.167 --> 20:50.101
(Startled)
Hey!

20:53.371 --> 20:54.371
You all right?

20:54.439 --> 20:55.772
Yeah.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.574
I keep getting it snagged
in the tree.

20:57.642 --> 20:59.676
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry about that.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.044
You'll get
the hang of it.

21:02.379 --> 21:03.446
Takes a while.

21:04.882 --> 21:06.783
I'm gonna head back to camp
and get some lunch,

21:06.851 --> 21:08.218
- wanna come?
- Yeah.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.559
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Sure is beautiful country, huh?</i>

21:22.465 --> 21:23.866
So, I was thinking,

21:23.934 --> 21:25.601
since the boys are gone
for the weekend,

21:25.669 --> 21:27.068
that you could
stay over tonight.

21:27.136 --> 21:28.336
You're just doin' that

21:28.403 --> 21:29.270
because you feel bad for me,
Amy.

21:29.338 --> 21:30.338
No, I'm not!

21:30.405 --> 21:31.572
I think
it would be fun!

21:31.641 --> 21:32.707
Okay, sure.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.276
(Truck rumbles up)

21:42.951 --> 21:44.652
Amy, get over here!

21:44.719 --> 21:48.822
<i>I swear, I only looked away</i>
<i>for one minute!</i>

21:48.890 --> 21:50.691
Oh, Max!

21:50.759 --> 21:52.726
<i>Caleb:</i> <i>Yeah, he had a little
run-in</i> <i>with a porcupine.</i>

21:52.794 --> 21:54.028
Peter is gonna kill me!

21:54.095 --> 21:55.763
He loves this dog
more than anything.

21:55.830 --> 21:57.131
Okay, Mallory,
uh, call Scott.

21:57.198 --> 21:57.931
Find out
what we should do.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.398
I'm on it.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.433
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Bud!</i>

22:02.936 --> 22:04.336
He asked you what?

22:04.404 --> 22:06.372
I assumed
he already asked you.

22:06.439 --> 22:07.874
That's the first
I heard of it.

22:07.941 --> 22:10.143
Well, I figured
it might've come up, so.

22:10.210 --> 22:11.644
I wouldn't have said
anything otherwise.

22:11.712 --> 22:13.746
What the hell is he asking
your permission for

22:13.814 --> 22:15.313
and not mine?

22:15.381 --> 22:16.948
Look, I'm sure he just hasn't
gotten around to it yet!

22:17.016 --> 22:18.116
Hasn't gotten around to it?

22:18.184 --> 22:19.584
I'm her father,
for God's sake!

22:19.652 --> 22:21.787
You're taking this
way too personally.

22:21.854 --> 22:24.122
It is personal, Jack!

22:25.058 --> 22:26.091
It doesn't matter
what I do,

22:26.159 --> 22:27.726
it doesn't matter
what I say,

22:27.794 --> 22:29.327
it doesn't matter
how much land I buy

22:29.395 --> 22:32.629
so that my daughters
can be a part of my life,

22:32.698 --> 22:34.899
I always come second...

22:34.966 --> 22:36.033
To you!

22:39.604 --> 22:41.105
What are you doing?

22:41.173 --> 22:42.773
I'm gonna give the general
a piece of my mind!

22:42.841 --> 22:44.809
Oh ho,
no you are not!

22:44.876 --> 22:46.510
Peter's part
of Lou's life,

22:46.578 --> 22:47.711
whether you like it,
or not!

22:47.778 --> 22:48.778
Get out of my way,
old man.

22:48.846 --> 22:50.379
No way.

22:50.447 --> 22:51.414
(Grunting and struggling)

22:51.481 --> 22:52.548
(Splash)

22:53.918 --> 22:54.984
(Sighs)

22:56.087 --> 22:57.620
You really wanna do this?

22:57.688 --> 22:59.589
You just try me.

23:09.432 --> 23:10.632
Ungh!

23:10.700 --> 23:13.368
(Water splashes)

23:13.436 --> 23:14.369
Ungh!

23:14.437 --> 23:15.637
(Water splashes)

23:15.705 --> 23:17.840
What the hell's going on
over there?

23:17.907 --> 23:19.573
Ty: (Sighs heavily) Not again!

23:21.376 --> 23:22.443
<i>Peter:</i> <i>What do you
mean,</i> <i>"not again"?</i>

23:22.510 --> 23:23.911
What,
they've done this before?

23:23.979 --> 23:26.313
Ty: Yeah, it's like a...
Family tradition.

23:29.184 --> 23:30.618
Well, uh, like,
should we go break it up?

23:30.685 --> 23:31.685
Ungh!
(Hard punch)

23:31.754 --> 23:33.054
Peter:
Oh my God!

23:33.122 --> 23:35.122
Ty: Yeah. Yeah.
Peter: Yeah, let's go.

23:36.690 --> 23:37.590
Ungh!
Hmph!

23:37.658 --> 23:38.825
Peter:
Whoa! Whoa!

23:38.893 --> 23:39.860
Hey, fellas!

23:39.927 --> 23:41.094
Is that all you got?

23:41.162 --> 23:43.196
This is my bad hand!

23:43.264 --> 23:44.330
Peter:
Okay, okay.

23:44.398 --> 23:45.665
Hey, hey! Fellas!

23:45.733 --> 23:47.500
Ty: Come on, Jack!
Peter: Hey, break it up!

23:47.568 --> 23:48.835
Peter:
Oof!

23:48.903 --> 23:50.637
(Screams in pain)

23:50.704 --> 23:51.737
Oh.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.172
Now see what
you've done!

23:53.240 --> 23:54.406
Ahhhh!

23:54.474 --> 23:56.242
Wow!
(Half laughs)

23:57.177 --> 23:58.443
- Sorry.
- Yeah, no,

23:58.511 --> 24:00.913
no, it's okay.
I-I, uh, I ran in there.

24:01.848 --> 24:03.718
(Jack and Tim
breathe heavily)

24:06.694 --> 24:08.028
(Max whimpers)

24:08.096 --> 24:10.263
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Scott, I know you're not</i>
<i>officially back on duty yet,</i>

24:10.331 --> 24:11.798
but we didn't know
who else to call.

24:11.866 --> 24:13.633
Scott: Uh, that's okay, I
was getting kinda bored

24:13.701 --> 24:15.502
laying around the house,
anyway.

24:15.569 --> 24:17.136
Amy: Hey, Scott.
Scott: Hey.

24:17.204 --> 24:18.504
Some of the quills
are in pretty deep,

24:18.571 --> 24:20.272
I think he might've
swallowed some, too.

24:20.340 --> 24:22.208
Scott: All right, let's
see what we got here.

24:23.877 --> 24:25.444
Is he gonna be okay?

24:25.512 --> 24:27.213
Oh, he's gonna be fine.
How're you doin'?

24:27.280 --> 24:29.781
<i>Lou:</i> <i>See, Max?
Scott's gonna</i> <i>make you all better!</i>

24:29.849 --> 24:30.916
<i>Oh!</i>

24:33.020 --> 24:34.419
(Birds chirping)

24:36.723 --> 24:39.157
Jack:
Well, I'm going fishing.

24:40.092 --> 24:42.928
As far away from him
as I can get.

24:45.632 --> 24:46.765
Well, that's great.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.133
I might finally
catch something!

24:48.668 --> 24:50.668
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Hey, listen,</i> <i>Tim, uh...</i>

24:50.736 --> 24:52.436
Look,
no hard feelings, huh?

24:52.504 --> 24:55.640
<i>I shouldnt've gotten</i>
<i>in the middle of your uh...</i>

24:55.707 --> 24:58.743
Family feud
you're having there.

24:59.678 --> 25:00.912
I don't know
if you noticed,

25:00.979 --> 25:02.013
but I'm really starting
to dond with that guy.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.180
(Laughs)

25:03.248 --> 25:04.015
You guys seem
really close.

25:04.082 --> 25:05.282
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

25:05.350 --> 25:08.952
Yeah! Total... bromance thing
we got going.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.486
(Laughs)
Don't tell anybody.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.722
(Max grunts)

25:12.790 --> 25:14.223
There.

25:14.291 --> 25:15.692
I think that's
the last of it.

25:15.760 --> 25:16.693
Good boy!

25:16.761 --> 25:17.827
Don't worry,

25:17.895 --> 25:19.195
it looked a lot worse
than it was.

25:19.263 --> 25:22.364
I am obviously
the world's worst dog-sitter.

25:22.432 --> 25:25.901
Well, dogs,
they love porcupines,

25:25.969 --> 25:27.736
but the feeling
isn't mutual.

25:27.804 --> 25:28.971
Right, Max?

25:29.039 --> 25:30.439
Hey, I've been meaning
to call you

25:30.506 --> 25:31.440
since the accident,

25:31.507 --> 25:34.710
see how you're doing.

25:34.778 --> 25:36.679
So, how are you doing?

25:36.746 --> 25:38.145
I'm okay.

25:38.213 --> 25:40.682
Leg hurts
a little bit.

25:43.052 --> 25:44.686
Actually,
I've... been spending

25:44.753 --> 25:48.155
a whole lot of time
thinking about, uh...

25:48.223 --> 25:49.557
About what?

25:50.993 --> 25:52.827
I don't know.

25:52.895 --> 25:54.561
Regrets, I guess.

25:55.563 --> 25:57.998
Life's too short
for those.

25:58.066 --> 25:59.967
Don't I know it.

26:01.703 --> 26:04.638
(Sighs)
How's Ty holding up?

26:04.706 --> 26:07.074
(Scoffs)
I don't know, actually.

26:07.141 --> 26:09.875
Good enough to go fishing,
I guess.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.276
- Well.
- Oh, wait!

26:11.945 --> 26:13.345
Ungh.

26:13.413 --> 26:15.047
Do me a favour.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.515
Have him call me
when he gets back.

26:16.583 --> 26:18.584
He hasn't been
returning my phone calls.

26:18.652 --> 26:20.019
Okay.

26:20.087 --> 26:22.588
Thanks for coming by,
thanks for doing this.

26:22.656 --> 26:24.456
Well,
Peter saved my life.

26:24.524 --> 26:27.959
Least I can do is pull
a few quills from his dog.

26:30.329 --> 26:31.462
See you later.

26:31.530 --> 26:32.597
See ya.

26:33.398 --> 26:35.634
Scott:
See you later, Max.

26:40.339 --> 26:41.472
Oop! Careful!

26:41.540 --> 26:42.673
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

26:42.741 --> 26:45.809
<i>Ashley:</i>
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

26:47.612 --> 26:48.879
(Sighs)

26:48.947 --> 26:51.815
Okay,
you can open your eyes now.

26:51.883 --> 26:53.216
Flowers,

26:55.453 --> 26:57.521
burgers and fries...
Mmmm!

26:58.455 --> 27:02.191
And a romantic evening
boat cruise with yours truly.

27:02.259 --> 27:04.160
Not so bad, huh,
for our first date?

27:04.227 --> 27:05.862
I'm very impressed.

27:05.929 --> 27:06.963
And here I thought

27:07.031 --> 27:08.297
you were gonna work
all weekend.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.366
Well, I managed to get most
of Lou's to-do list done,

27:10.433 --> 27:12.501
so, I'm all yours.

27:13.137 --> 27:14.936
(Oars creak as they dip)

27:15.004 --> 27:18.206
Ashley: It's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.

27:18.274 --> 27:20.475
Caleb:
I messed this up once, so...

27:20.543 --> 27:22.944
I'm not gonna do that again.

27:24.513 --> 27:25.981
You know, now that Ty's
going away to school,

27:26.049 --> 27:28.249
I'm gonna need someone
to help me with the...

27:28.317 --> 27:29.950
Client horses.

27:30.018 --> 27:31.919
You want me
to be your assistant?

27:31.987 --> 27:33.988
Oh, I was thinking
more like a...

27:34.056 --> 27:36.356
A friend who helps me
now and then.

27:36.424 --> 27:38.826
A friend.
I like that.

27:40.195 --> 27:41.929
Sucks though
that Ty's leaving.

27:41.997 --> 27:44.431
Sort of feels like
he's already gone.

27:44.499 --> 27:46.733
What do you mean?

27:46.801 --> 27:49.169
Ever since the accident,
he's just...

27:49.236 --> 27:50.403
I don't know,

27:50.470 --> 27:51.805
he seems like
he's a million miles away.

27:51.872 --> 27:54.174
I...
He won't talk to me.

27:54.241 --> 27:55.374
He just pretends
everything's all right,

27:55.442 --> 27:57.877
but I know it's not.
It's...

27:57.945 --> 28:00.546
(Sighing) I just feel
like I'm losing him.

28:00.614 --> 28:02.047
Boo hoo, Amy.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.281
Amy: Mallory!
Mallory: Sorry,

28:03.349 --> 28:04.683
but Ty's the one
who almost died!

28:04.751 --> 28:06.284
Don't you think he deserves
to be a little bit distant

28:06.352 --> 28:07.619
and moody for a while?

28:07.687 --> 28:08.921
I mean, he's got a lot
to deal with.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.989
<i>Give him a break!</i>

28:13.159 --> 28:14.860
Too honest, right?

28:14.928 --> 28:17.262
<i>I've gotta watch that.</i>

28:17.330 --> 28:19.463
No.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.799
Actually, you're making
a lot of sense.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.468
(River babbles)

28:25.403 --> 28:27.205
(Owl hoots,
fire crackles)

28:27.272 --> 28:29.340
(Low growling,
Ty gasps awake)

28:31.509 --> 28:33.577
<i>(Jingling sound)</i>

28:43.020 --> 28:44.087
<i>(Jingling sound)</i>

28:50.761 --> 28:52.527

(Gasps)

29:07.977 --> 29:09.110
(Breathing heavily)

29:09.178 --> 29:10.511
Easy, now.

29:10.579 --> 29:12.280
Put the gun down, Ty.

29:14.683 --> 29:16.417
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

29:25.126 --> 29:26.794
(Breathing heavily)

29:28.963 --> 29:31.031
(Cows mooing,
birds chirping)

29:38.371 --> 29:39.939
Lou:
(Chuckles)

29:40.007 --> 29:41.573
Good morning, Max.

29:43.543 --> 29:45.744
You miss Peter, huh?

29:45.813 --> 29:46.879
Me too.

29:49.883 --> 29:51.583
Oh, shoot!

29:51.651 --> 29:53.152
Come on, Max!
The photographer!

29:53.220 --> 29:54.853
We gotta go, we gotta go,
we gotta go!

29:55.822 --> 29:58.890
I told you,
I heard something.

30:01.393 --> 30:02.527
So when's the last time

30:02.594 --> 30:04.129
you had a good night's
sleep?

30:04.197 --> 30:05.563
I'm betting
not since the accident.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.365
Come on, Jack.

30:10.368 --> 30:12.336
If I go to sleep,
I have these dreams.

30:13.271 --> 30:15.372
It sounds crazy,
doesn't it?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.674
(Amused) Hmm.
Well...

30:17.742 --> 30:19.343
Nobody goes through
what you did

30:19.410 --> 30:23.314
without it having
some kind of effect on 'em.

30:24.249 --> 30:25.482
But you gotta talk
to somebody

30:25.550 --> 30:27.416
about what happened.

30:27.484 --> 30:29.485
And I'd start with Scott -
he was there with you.

30:29.553 --> 30:33.689
If I talk to Scott,
it'll just remind me...

30:36.126 --> 30:38.027
I can't go back there.

30:39.763 --> 30:42.998
Maybe you've gotta go back
before you can move forward.

30:43.066 --> 30:45.200
Otherwise, it'll follow you
wherever you go.

30:45.268 --> 30:46.335
(Twig snaps)

30:53.176 --> 30:54.509
(Truck rumbles)

30:55.879 --> 30:56.945
What?!

30:57.880 --> 30:59.080
<i>Great!</i>

30:59.882 --> 31:02.083
<i>(Truck door opens,</i>
<i>cow moos)</i>

31:02.150 --> 31:03.885
(Phone buttons beep)

31:07.822 --> 31:09.357
Caleb,

31:09.424 --> 31:11.893
<i>please tell me you</i>
<i>checked the fence yesterday!</i>

31:11.960 --> 31:13.494
Call me when you get
this message.

31:13.561 --> 31:16.263
(Heavy thudding,
cows mooing)

31:17.198 --> 31:19.799
Oh, no,
this is not happening!

31:19.867 --> 31:20.934
No!

31:22.068 --> 31:22.735
No way!

31:24.872 --> 31:26.005
(Cows mooing)

31:27.274 --> 31:28.875
No!

31:28.942 --> 31:30.376
No, no, no, no!

31:31.879 --> 31:33.012
(Stunned)

31:33.079 --> 31:34.480
(Cows moo)

31:39.998 --> 31:40.998
Lou:
Cows!

31:41.066 --> 31:43.201
The dude ranch is full of cows.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.668
Have you seen Caleb?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.070
I need him to round them up,

31:46.138 --> 31:47.271
and he's not answering
his damn cell phone!

31:47.339 --> 31:49.040
Isn't that photographer
coming in today?

31:49.107 --> 31:50.507
Yeah.
In less than an hour.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.975
And if I can't
round them up,

31:52.043 --> 31:54.377
then we just can't be
in the magazine, then.

31:54.445 --> 31:56.079
Pick up,
pick up!!

31:56.147 --> 31:58.014
Okay, Lou, relax.
All right?

31:58.082 --> 31:59.349
We don't need Caleb
to do this.

31:59.416 --> 32:00.683
<i>If the three of us</i>
<i>leave right now,</i>

32:00.751 --> 32:02.185
we can have those cows
rounded up in no time.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.619
We even have
a good cutting horse.

32:05.122 --> 32:06.323
Okay.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.489
Let's saddle up.

32:08.558 --> 32:09.624
Lou: Okay.
Amy: Come on!

32:12.362 --> 32:16.332
You know, I had this crazy idea
in my head

32:16.399 --> 32:18.533
that uh...
By the end of this trip,

32:18.601 --> 32:20.135
you and I were gonna be
these great buddies

32:20.203 --> 32:22.471
<i>or something.</i>

32:22.538 --> 32:23.704
It's pretty obvious
that's not gonna happen,

32:23.772 --> 32:25.173
isn't it?

32:26.775 --> 32:30.544
I guess my question to you
is uh... why?

32:30.612 --> 32:32.747
Why do you
dislike me so much?

32:32.814 --> 32:34.983
Why does it matter?

32:35.050 --> 32:36.384
(Sighs)

32:36.451 --> 32:38.086
You know, I just thought
it might be nice

32:38.153 --> 32:39.419
if we could be
in the same room together,

32:39.487 --> 32:41.855
I don't know.

32:41.923 --> 32:44.925
You know, by the time Lou
was old enough to start dating,

32:44.993 --> 32:46.894
I was long gone.

32:48.129 --> 32:50.397
I wasn't around to...

32:50.464 --> 32:52.766
Wait up by the phone
worrying on a Saturday night,

32:52.833 --> 32:54.034
or...

32:54.102 --> 32:55.268
I wasn't there
to answer the door

32:55.335 --> 32:58.104
when some pimply-faced kid
came around

32:58.171 --> 32:59.838
and wanted to take
my daughter out.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.442
I'm just not good at this.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.477
I feel like one
of those pimply-faced kids,

33:05.545 --> 33:07.213
okay?

33:07.281 --> 33:08.347
But I'm not asking you

33:08.415 --> 33:09.248
to take your daughter
out on a date.

33:09.316 --> 33:11.149
I'm-I'm standing here,

33:11.217 --> 33:13.785
and I'm asking you
for your blessing to marry her.

33:18.090 --> 33:19.224
(Sighs)

33:24.030 --> 33:26.664
(Sighs deeply)

33:26.732 --> 33:28.032
(Fire hisses)

33:29.134 --> 33:30.567
You know, I still remember
what Jack said to me

33:30.635 --> 33:33.670
when I asked him
the same thing.

33:33.738 --> 33:35.406
He said Marion probably
wouldn't care

33:35.473 --> 33:37.574
whether or not I got
her father's blessing.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.276
(Laughs)

33:39.344 --> 33:41.011
He also said that,

33:41.079 --> 33:42.612
if she said yes,

33:43.547 --> 33:46.615
if Marion felt
that I was the one,

33:46.683 --> 33:49.718
well, she could probably do
a lot worse.

33:49.786 --> 33:50.920
Yeah, (Chuckles)
Sorry,

33:50.988 --> 33:54.257
that just sounds...
very familiar.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.092
(Laughs)
Incredibly familiar.

33:57.361 --> 33:59.461
But you better treat
my little girl right,

33:59.528 --> 34:01.896
or next time I punch you,
it's gonna be for real.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.066
You bet.

34:07.636 --> 34:10.105
Lou: Okay, so we've got
to herd all these cows

34:10.172 --> 34:12.440
back towards the fence
and onto Big River.

34:12.507 --> 34:14.176
What about
all the cow poo?

34:14.243 --> 34:16.110
We'll deal with that later.

34:16.178 --> 34:17.277
On second thought,

34:17.346 --> 34:20.081
Caleb will deal
with that later.

34:23.851 --> 34:24.885
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey! Hup!</i>

34:24.953 --> 34:26.219
<i>Hup! Hup!</i>

34:26.288 --> 34:27.654

34:27.722 --> 34:29.489

Come on, cows!

34:33.627 --> 34:34.694
Hup!

34:38.199 --> 34:40.600
(Cows moo and grunt noisily)

34:44.938 --> 34:46.239
You know,
you're still pretty feisty

34:46.306 --> 34:47.539
for an old guy.

34:47.607 --> 34:48.706
Well,

34:48.774 --> 34:51.743
I can put you on the ground
any day.

34:52.678 --> 34:53.911
Don't you forget that.

34:55.248 --> 34:56.581
Tim:
(Chuckles)

35:00.920 --> 35:02.321
So, what do you think
of this PW guy?

35:02.389 --> 35:04.022
You think he's good enough
for our Lou?

35:04.089 --> 35:06.624
Well, I'm not sure.

35:06.691 --> 35:07.758
Maybe.

35:09.961 --> 35:11.462
Well, I'll tell you
one thing:

35:11.530 --> 35:12.763
If he still wants
to marry her

35:12.831 --> 35:14.232
after this fishing trip,

35:14.299 --> 35:15.299
he might just be
crazy enough

35:15.367 --> 35:16.300
to be in this family.

35:16.368 --> 35:17.468
(Laughs)

35:17.536 --> 35:19.536
You might just be
right about that.

35:19.603 --> 35:21.004
(Chuckles)

35:21.939 --> 35:23.673
(Cows moo, horses whinny)

35:26.810 --> 35:29.612
Lou: Well, I guess I'd
better be getting back.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.415
It's okay, Mallory and I can
take it from here.

35:31.482 --> 35:32.482
Okay.

35:35.752 --> 35:37.086
You okay?

35:38.355 --> 35:39.721
He's never here
when I need him.

35:40.990 --> 35:43.259
Well, I'm sure Caleb
will turn up eventually.

35:43.326 --> 35:44.793
Not Caleb.
Peter.

35:46.163 --> 35:47.463
Seeing him every other weekend,

35:47.531 --> 35:49.965
it just...
It isn't good enough any more.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.368
It's pretty obvious
that he loves you.

35:53.436 --> 35:55.203
I love him too,
but...

35:55.271 --> 35:57.905
I'm tired of missing him
all the time, you know?

35:57.973 --> 36:00.041
<i>(Cell phone rings)</i>

36:02.244 --> 36:04.546
Caleb. Meet me back
at the dude ranch,

36:04.613 --> 36:06.214
and bring a shovel.

36:07.148 --> 36:08.382
(River babbles gently)

36:25.031 --> 36:26.099
Peter:
Yeah! Fish on!

36:26.166 --> 36:27.233
Peter: I got one!
Jack: Okay!

36:27.301 --> 36:28.468
Woo!

36:28.535 --> 36:29.935
I told ya there were
fish in here!

36:31.938 --> 36:34.207
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Okay. Now give him some line.</i>

36:34.274 --> 36:35.475
Bring him in
nice and slow.

36:35.542 --> 36:36.542
Peter:
All right, all right.

36:36.610 --> 36:38.544
Keep your tip up!
Woo!

36:38.612 --> 36:40.078
Looks like a four pounder,
maybe six!

36:40.146 --> 36:41.246
Look at that!

36:41.314 --> 36:42.447
Oh, he lies like
fisherman!

36:42.515 --> 36:43.615
Yeah, yeah,
I get it, I get it.

36:43.682 --> 36:44.749
Ahhh!

36:47.886 --> 36:49.654
Does this mean we can say
we didn't get skunked?

36:49.722 --> 36:50.955
No, it doesn't!

36:51.023 --> 36:53.925
We still got two hours
to actually catch one.

36:53.993 --> 36:55.426
But what if we don't?

36:55.494 --> 36:57.461
It's one more thing
we're gonna lie about.

36:59.464 --> 37:01.665
My truck's gonna smell like
a feedlot for a month.

37:01.733 --> 37:03.167
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>you should've thought of that</i>

37:03.235 --> 37:06.270
before you decided
not to check the fences.

Now hurry up,
get going.

Hey, I'm Kyle.

Thanks.

37:23.454 --> 37:25.321
Hey. I'm gonna show
you a spot

37:25.389 --> 37:28.457
you would be crazy
not to put on the cover.

Cool, a cow!

37:30.360 --> 37:31.793
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It must be a stray.</i>

37:31.861 --> 37:33.995
I'm just gonna get
my ranch hand to round it up.

37:34.063 --> 37:35.229
- Right now.
- No, no. Leave him there!

37:35.297 --> 37:37.565
He looks great.
Very country.

37:49.978 --> 37:51.045
Hey!

37:51.612 --> 37:53.246
Peter,
what happened to your eye?!

37:53.314 --> 37:55.081
Just walked into a branch.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.516
Huh.

37:56.584 --> 37:59.152
Dad, did that same branch
give you a fat lip?

37:59.220 --> 38:01.221
Oh, no.
No branch for me.

38:01.289 --> 38:02.589
Wrestled a giant trout.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.090
Jack: Hmph!
Tim: Got away.

38:04.158 --> 38:05.725
Lou: Right...
Mallory: Yeah, right!

38:05.793 --> 38:07.060
I bet you guys
were drinking beer

38:07.127 --> 38:08.394
and beating each other up
all weekend!

38:08.461 --> 38:09.795
Jack:
Hey, I'll have you know

38:09.862 --> 38:12.431
that we take our fishing
very seriously.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.567
Lou: Oh yeah, Grandpa?
So where's all the trout?

38:14.634 --> 38:17.002
Catch and release, Lou.
Be poaching otherwise.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.337
Peter: That's right.
Tim: That's right!

38:18.405 --> 38:20.239
So, how'd that photo shoot go,
honey?

38:20.307 --> 38:22.140
It was great.
Yeah.

38:22.209 --> 38:24.309
No problems,
it was picture perfect.

38:24.376 --> 38:25.476
Good.

38:25.544 --> 38:26.844
Hey, how was Max?

38:26.912 --> 38:28.613
Hope he wasn't too much trouble
for you.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.047
<i>Where is he?</i>

38:30.115 --> 38:31.849
In my room.

38:31.917 --> 38:33.251
Your room?

38:33.319 --> 38:34.319
Yeah, why don't you just
finish that beer

38:34.386 --> 38:36.454
and we'll go see him after.

38:43.361 --> 38:44.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:46.063 --> 38:47.631
- You're back.
- Yeah.

38:48.833 --> 38:49.766
Did you catch anything?

38:49.834 --> 38:51.067
Not really.

38:51.135 --> 38:53.103
Spent most of the weekend
untangling my line.

Good to see you, too.

Thanks for, uh,
coming to meeting me.

39:27.302 --> 39:30.470
Well, I'm just glad
you finally called.

39:30.537 --> 39:31.604
Yeah,
sorry it took me so long,

39:31.672 --> 39:33.907
I've just been uh...

39:35.243 --> 39:36.309
It's okay.

39:43.651 --> 39:45.985
Do you ever have dreams
about uh...

39:46.052 --> 39:48.353
What happened?

39:48.421 --> 39:50.122
(Sighs)

39:50.190 --> 39:51.323
Every single night.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.874
Max... poor guy.

39:59.642 --> 40:01.510
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened out there?

40:02.077 --> 40:03.912
(Snorts softly)

40:03.980 --> 40:06.313
Hey, you know what
we should do?

40:06.881 --> 40:07.981
What should we do?

40:08.049 --> 40:09.249
Let's go on a trip.

40:10.184 --> 40:11.551
Just me and you.

40:11.619 --> 40:12.685
Yeah?

40:13.354 --> 40:14.921
(Cell phone rings)

40:17.625 --> 40:20.727
(Sighs) One second,
I gotta get this.

40:20.794 --> 40:22.361
Yeah? PW.

40:22.429 --> 40:24.296
Oh... look at you.

40:24.364 --> 40:25.564
What?!

40:26.299 --> 40:28.000
You're kidding me!
No. No, no, no!

40:28.068 --> 40:29.735
Don't, don't, don't-
just don't do anything.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.003
Okay?

40:31.071 --> 40:33.005
Well, I gotta come in,
don't I?

40:33.073 --> 40:34.773
Yeah. No, I'll get
the next flight out.

40:34.841 --> 40:36.708
Just let him know.

40:36.776 --> 40:38.176
All right!

40:39.145 --> 40:40.412
I...
(Sighs heavily)

40:40.479 --> 40:42.313
- You have to go.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

40:42.381 --> 40:44.749
- Kinda major, I...
- It's okay.

40:44.816 --> 40:47.185
Just...take care of Max, okay?

40:47.253 --> 40:48.653
Yeah, I will.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.488
Um, listen.

40:50.556 --> 40:52.290
We'll talk about that trip
when I get back, okay?

40:52.358 --> 40:53.490
I promise.

40:53.558 --> 40:54.624
Okay.

40:56.094 --> 40:58.995
Hey, I love you.

41:02.467 --> 41:05.469
Mmm!
I'll miss you.

41:06.604 --> 41:08.605
Yes, Mom.
I got the extra pickles.

41:08.673 --> 41:10.739
I'll see you in the car.

41:12.276 --> 41:14.077
Jamie:
Hey, um, Mallory.

41:14.144 --> 41:15.111
Mallory:
Hey.

41:15.179 --> 41:16.345
Um...

41:17.281 --> 41:19.449
You coming, Jamie?
I'm starving.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.317
Um, just hold on
one sec.

41:24.354 --> 41:26.354
Um...

41:26.422 --> 41:28.390
I was thinking we should
maybe hang out this weenend,

41:28.458 --> 41:30.392
<i>or something.</i>

41:30.460 --> 41:32.427
I don't know.

41:32.495 --> 41:33.895
Things might be different
in high school,

41:33.963 --> 41:36.898
but at least
I know who my friends are.

41:44.740 --> 41:45.907
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Okay, Grandpa.</i>

41:45.975 --> 41:49.143
You can't leave me
in suspense any longer.

41:49.211 --> 41:51.545
Dad's fat lip,
Peter's shiner -

41:51.614 --> 41:54.381
<i>there is a story</i>
<i>you're not telling me here.</i>

41:54.449 --> 41:56.084
You wanna know the story?

41:56.151 --> 41:57.751
Yes!

41:57.819 --> 41:59.319
Here's the story:

41:59.386 --> 42:03.289
I'd been fishing all day long
without a single bite.

42:04.258 --> 42:07.160
I was about to give up
and head back to camp,

42:07.228 --> 42:10.631
when I hooked
a beauty of a trout.

42:11.633 --> 42:13.166
<i>Biggest trout I ever saw.</i>

42:13.234 --> 42:16.502
<i>Must've been sixteen,</i>
<i>seventeen pounds...</i>

42:16.569 --> 42:18.638
(Grass rustles)

42:20.674 --> 42:22.174
Amy:
Ty?

42:22.242 --> 42:23.976
Where are we going?

42:24.044 --> 42:26.712
Uh, I don't know.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.414
I guess here's good.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.854
Okay, let's go.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.055
Wait.

42:37.123 --> 42:38.890
Why did you bring me
out here?

42:38.958 --> 42:40.959
Scott told me
to make an offering.

42:41.027 --> 42:43.094
Tobacco, you know?

42:44.030 --> 42:45.196
You remember the wolf
I told you about,

42:45.264 --> 42:46.263
the one I saw
that night?

42:46.330 --> 42:47.731
Yeah.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.534
Well, I'm not really into
the spiritual stuff, but...

42:50.601 --> 42:52.536
May I have it?

42:52.603 --> 42:53.737
Please?

42:54.472 --> 42:55.773
What?

42:55.840 --> 42:58.108
<i>(Sighing)</i>
<i>What're you doing?</i>

42:58.176 --> 42:59.743
I don't think Scott
told you to come out here

42:59.811 --> 43:02.578
and just throw it
on the ground like that.

43:02.646 --> 43:04.413
Here.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.282
Take your time.

43:07.584 --> 43:09.719
Maybe this is something
you should do on your own.

43:09.787 --> 43:10.853
Amy.

43:12.622 --> 43:15.892
I talked to my student advisor
today.

43:15.959 --> 43:16.959
I decided to wait
until next year

43:17.027 --> 43:18.193
to go to university.

43:18.260 --> 43:20.195
Y-you're not doing this
for me, are you?

43:20.262 --> 43:21.629
No, I'm not.

43:21.698 --> 43:23.431
I'm doing it for me.

43:23.499 --> 43:25.300
You were right,

43:25.367 --> 43:27.102
I'm not fine.

43:27.170 --> 43:29.037
But I'm working on it.

43:29.105 --> 43:32.607
And right now,
this is where I need to be, so.

43:32.675 --> 43:33.741
Okay.

43:35.310 --> 43:36.977
Okay.

43:41.850 --> 43:44.185
