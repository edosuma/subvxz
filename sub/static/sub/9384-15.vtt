make you look like the bad guy, too.

and you're the one who's having it all!

are we supposed to get home?

fake passports on the black market.

Where are you going?

18:35.741 --> 18:37.951
You're never gonna find the black market!

about that back-alley abortionist.

Was it one? No, two.
Yes, she's two weeks younger than you.

Just look at that butt!
That is a tight butt!

19:09.191 --> 19:11.485

years of sexual ambiguity...

Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?

here alive, I should tell you...

we'd meet up in Heaven. I was lying.

to that saucy harlot.

She taught me a valuable lesson.

20:19.636 --> 20:23.182
There's really no such thing as love.
It's just a puffed-up word used...

...by Madison Avenue to sell
their skin creams and two-seater cars.
