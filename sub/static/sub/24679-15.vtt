00:06.440 --> 00:08.943
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.009 --> 00:11.114
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:11.178 --> 00:13.954
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.755
These are their stories.

00:18.051 --> 00:21.032
"You got into fights, you
spent four years in solitary.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.295
"What do you have to say
for yourself, Mr. Dietrich?"

00:23.357 --> 00:26.998
So I said, "Well, what can I say, Warden?

00:27.060 --> 00:29.040
"l just like to have a good time."

00:31.365 --> 00:36.007
Yes, another milestone.
Eight hours as a free man.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.548
(ALL CHEERING)

00:38.272 --> 00:39.273
Mark.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.578
I'm Chantal. Can you sign something for me?

00:43.944 --> 00:45.821
I saved it all these years.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.290
You looked so hot.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.849
Naomi, give me a pen.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.957
So, is this really the bar where you
and Mandy hooked up that night?

00:55.022 --> 00:58.629
Baby, it was 15 years ago. It was
called something else back then.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.002
Hey, Penny, take a picture of me and Mark.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.405
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Here, look.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.974
"I'm Mandy. Don't choke me so hard, Mark."

01:08.302 --> 01:09.303
Mark?

01:11.171 --> 01:12.946
I brought you coffee.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.147
Miss?

01:19.112 --> 01:20.113
Oh!

01:27.220 --> 01:28.563
(GROANING)

01:32.025 --> 01:34.096
One thing I learned in prison, Mom,

01:34.161 --> 01:36.903
is not to kill the girls I have sex with.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:07.527 --> 02:10.701
I want you to feel good,
Mark, good and powerful.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.502
Is this how you want me? Yeah. Yeah.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.874
MARK: I've been watching you

02:15.936 --> 02:17.916
running around the reservoir,

02:17.971 --> 02:21.578
watching your butt in those
little silver running shorts.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.920
...running around the reservoir,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.482
watching your butt in those
little silver running shorts.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.050
Is all you're gonna do is watch?

02:30.117 --> 02:32.620
Shut up. Shut up.

02:33.453 --> 02:36.991
I'm gonna fill your mouth with
sand, so you start choking.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.792
Get all tight.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.204
MARK: I'm going out now.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.513
What's the matter, Mom? I know
you've been watching me. What is it?

02:50.103 --> 02:53.846
You're a malignant narcissist.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.155
What did you say?

02:58.745 --> 03:00.122
Never mind.

03:01.648 --> 03:02.991
Have a nice night.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.525
And try not to hurt anyone.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.804
I don't remember, all right.
It was 15 years ago.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.137
Come on. I just want to see
where you killed Mandy.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.438
I'm gonna kill you if you don't knock it off!

03:19.499 --> 03:20.944
Where's your coke?

03:21.334 --> 03:24.713
Just show me. Okay, like, you hooked
up with her at the bar that night.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.411
She was wearing a little
black dress, like this.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.185
I'm sick of this crap!

03:30.243 --> 03:31.779
Mark, wait up. Wait up.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.381
Hey, Mark!

03:34.514 --> 03:35.754
Mark, wait up!

04:02.242 --> 04:04.813
Mom, where'd you hide the coffee?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.956
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Mom.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.388
Mom.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.197
No. No, no, no, no!

04:23.263 --> 04:26.210
No, no, no, no!

04:27.167 --> 04:28.168
No.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.753
SIMS: A co-worker found her.
No forcible entry.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.891
She lived alone till Dietrich moved in a
month ago. "My son, the Yuppie Killer."

05:21.955 --> 05:23.491
He's why we're here. Anybody seen him?

05:23.557 --> 05:24.592
Not since yesterday.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.433
The neighbors heard them
arguing on and off though.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.940
Life with a psychopath. I'll talk
to the co-worker when she's ready.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.204
Well,

05:37.704 --> 05:41.550
the killer caught her behind the ear. She...

05:42.542 --> 05:44.249
She crawled to here.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.585
The...

05:47.881 --> 05:50.293
The back of her nightgown is, is...

05:50.517 --> 05:54.329
Is bunched up, but the
front has been pulled down

05:56.056 --> 05:57.501
to cover her.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.437
Someone was worried about her modesty?

06:01.494 --> 06:05.340
The girl Dietrich killed in the park
didn't rate that kind of consideration.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.809
That lady's ready.

06:11.905 --> 06:16.411
I talked to Laura last night, just to
make sure that she wanted a ride to work.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.616
We're fact-checkers for a
publisher in Long Island City.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.125
Was she expecting company last night?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.890
No, Laura didn't socialize much.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.090
Especially since her son came home.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.429
How was that going, between her and Mark?

06:29.489 --> 06:32.800
Well, she was hoping for the
best, you know, but they argued.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.931
And then she just stopped
talking about him altogether.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.359
Mrs. Dietrich's cell phone is missing.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.138
Has anyone been reading this paper?

07:11.197 --> 07:12.642
No, it was out in the hallway.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.939
I brought it in.

07:22.375 --> 07:26.551
I'm gonna need this bagged, exactly as is.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.656
We...

07:32.485 --> 07:34.226
Let's go for a ride.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.804
I… I’m…

07:49.536 --> 07:52.915
I'm gonna need a Polaroid of this, please.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.185
You all set?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.399
Mark, how you doing?

08:14.828 --> 08:18.241
I'm sorry I had to deliver
the bad news over the phone.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.706
Yeah, you figured out my mom
lent me her phone, huh?

08:21.768 --> 08:23.577
Uh-huh. We wake you up?

08:23.903 --> 08:26.713
My girlfriend and I were just waking up, so...

08:27.707 --> 08:29.152
Where are we going?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.717
You know, Mark, Detective Eames
thought that you were good for this.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.884
I thought you went on the lam.

08:36.015 --> 08:40.465
Except you left your Xanax
behind and your mom's money.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.563
It was on her dresser.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.305
Are you ready?

08:58.638 --> 08:59.912
(SOBBING)

09:03.610 --> 09:05.385
You found her like this?

09:07.147 --> 09:08.217
Yes.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.452
See.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.120
Why?

09:14.921 --> 09:16.195
I just...

09:18.892 --> 09:22.965
I mean, can we cover her up? She
wouldn't want to be seen like this.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.168
She was a very modest woman.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.109
We need to go downtown,

09:28.701 --> 09:30.738
so you can sign some papers.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.152
I meant to ask you. Did
your mother have any enemies?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.890
She got some phone calls, a few years back,

09:42.949 --> 09:45.225
from the brother of the girl.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.425
Mandy Johanssen, the girl
you strangled in the park.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.728
By mistake.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.829
I wrote a letter to that family,
telling them how sorry I was.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.340
But you can never be
too sorry for some people.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.901
Last night, where were you again?

10:01.968 --> 10:05.108
With my girlfriend, Chantal Fielding.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.812
Does she know about you?

10:07.874 --> 10:10.115
She knows it was a long time ago.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.452
Gena will help you fill out the forms.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.020
Oh, uh...

10:15.281 --> 10:16.351
All those?

10:16.416 --> 10:19.295
It's what you have to do when a
member of your family gets murdered.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.662
You tracked mud in with your shoes.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.064
Yeah, sorry.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.208
It's horse manure.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.583
Mark was really upset
when he heard about his mom.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.242
I felt so sorry for him.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.308
I felt sorry for his mom.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.854
Did you ever meet her?

10:43.910 --> 10:46.720
No. I only met Mark a couple of weeks ago.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.953
I'm sorry, I dropped something.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.821
So, what did you and Mark do last night?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.133
We went out to dinner,

10:56.189 --> 10:59.602
and then came back here.
Fell asleep watching TV.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.299
Gee, you two sound just like my parents.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.137
That's probably why Mark appreciates it,

11:04.197 --> 11:06.643
'cause it's so, you know, ordinary.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.307
Especially with a guy like Mark.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.048
You know, he's a magnet for extreme attention.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.584
Absolutely. You should've seen the
skank he was with when I met him.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.521
Yeah, I know the type.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.853
Murder groupies.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.953
Mark said she started writing him in prison.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.160
These women, they like to visit murder scenes.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.933
It gets them hot.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.403
You never

11:38.131 --> 11:40.008
were tempted to, you know,

11:41.167 --> 11:42.441
ask Mark?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.503
No.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.016
Because, you know, it's not that far
away. It's just on the bridle path

11:46.072 --> 11:48.678
where they walk the horses. In fact,

11:49.509 --> 11:52.718
it's where they found the girl Mandy.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.455
She had a smell of horse manure.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.793
Like this, you know?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.798
Like the mud on your boots.
Like the mud on Mark's shoes.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.963
How was it, Chantal?

12:08.027 --> 12:11.065
Did you ask Mark to call you Mandy while
he wrapped a scarf around your neck?

12:11.130 --> 12:12.404
That is so sick.

12:12.465 --> 12:17.437
You know, Mark, he told us that there's
3 varieties of murder groupies,

12:18.338 --> 12:21.911
victims, psychos, shrinks.

12:22.141 --> 12:24.985
He said with you, he's got 3 mints in one.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.421
Oh, that loser!

12:31.117 --> 12:33.563
All right. You wanna know what he did?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.095
We went into the park,

12:36.556 --> 12:39.002
and then he freaked out.
I had to walk home by myself.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.628
And what got him upset?

12:40.693 --> 12:44.004
I don't know. He was whining all night
about his mother being mad at him.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.633
What time did he show up here?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.201
I don't know, about 6:30 in the morning.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.307
He curled up like a little
baby and went to sleep.

12:52.705 --> 12:53.911
Look, if I killed my mother,

12:53.973 --> 12:55.714
- I'd be in South America by now.
- I just wanted you to know

12:55.775 --> 12:59.052
- You said yourself, I didn't run away.
- that your attempt to deceive
us didn't go unnoticed.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.388
- You forgot one thing, the morning paper.
- Look, my mom has it delivered.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.757
The first officer to arrive on
the scene found it outside.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.320
Where you put it, when you brought it
in, when you came back from the park.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.388
No.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.094
You read the sports section,
you killed your mom.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.627
- No!
- You slipped the sports section back
into the newspaper.

13:14.694 --> 13:18.733
Put it back outside, only, you put
it back in the wrong section.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.573
- At this point, Mark's invoking his rights.
- No, no, no.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.408
- Look, I wanna tell them what happened.
- No, no, no, Mark.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.539
I just wanna get it over with.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.617
I got home, I was drunk,
and I blacked out, okay.

13:32.378 --> 13:36.019
I came to. I went looking
for my mom and I found her.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.518
And she was already dead.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.491
- I got scared.
- And you're saying that

13:40.553 --> 13:42.658
there's this huge chunk of time
that you have no memory of.

13:42.722 --> 13:46.101
I'm saying that I passed out
in the living room. I...

13:48.561 --> 13:50.370
I did not kill my mother.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.070
Your mother told her friends you fought.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.840
Yeah, well, when I first got out, yeah.

13:55.902 --> 13:59.247
All that lecturing and moralizing.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.875
- But not lately.
- So that was the problem.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.318
- No, we were barely speaking.
- That's the problem, right there.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.653
- She'd given up on you.
- Yeah, right, so what do I care?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.294
She called me

14:14.454 --> 14:16.365
a malignant narcissist.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.103
That was the last thing she said to me.

14:22.829 --> 14:27.278
She was the only one I had left out
here. Why would I want to kill her?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.173
I mean, why would I want to do that to myself?

14:35.641 --> 14:36.915
When someone is killed

14:36.976 --> 14:39.286
by receiving a blow to the head,

14:39.345 --> 14:41.723
it sends up a fine spray of blood

14:41.781 --> 14:43.988
that's unrecognizable to the...

14:44.484 --> 14:45.554
to the human eye.

14:45.618 --> 14:49.191
Once the lab gets done with their
microscopic inspection of your clothes,

14:49.255 --> 14:52.031
we'll have you cooked six ways to Sunday.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.705
She was my mother.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.368
There was no way I killed her.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.637
Why did you stop?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.043
Look, when you tell a suspect

15:07.106 --> 15:09.780
that there's incriminating
evidence on the way, they...

15:09.842 --> 15:11.753
They get quiet. They...

15:12.512 --> 15:15.322
They start to try to remember
what they missed.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.952
You know, they don't keep
claiming their innocence.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.788
Or he really doesn't remember killing her.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.230
Mark's mother,

15:23.489 --> 15:26.231
she called him a malignant narcissist.

15:27.827 --> 15:31.798
That's a clinical term that
psychiatrists use amongst themselves.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.912
She has no background in psychology.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.740
She stopped talking to him.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.913
She withdrew.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.146
There's something going on with her.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.748
Mark Dietrich should've gotten
life for choking that girl.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.690
He caught a break, but not this time.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.455
Just get the evidence and bury him.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.834
The only change that I can think of is,

15:59.892 --> 16:02.532
we stopped riding home together 3 weeks ago.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.097
I thought she was taking a class.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.143
She was always home by 9:30.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.809
She made notes. "Remorseless,
charming, predatory."

16:11.871 --> 16:13.475
Anybody we know?

16:14.106 --> 16:16.279
"Shallow emotional affect,

16:17.343 --> 16:19.550
"rehabilitation is rare."

16:20.279 --> 16:21.781
You know, I...

16:22.048 --> 16:25.962
Look, what, was she fact-checking
a psychiatric text?

16:26.285 --> 16:29.095
No. We only check statistical data.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.660
Rolls of nickels.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.601
Do you have any vending machines
that only take nickels?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.697
No. What costs a nickel these days?

16:36.762 --> 16:38.469
Microfilm machines.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.873
They use them in the library
to copy newspapers.

16:46.572 --> 16:51.317
These are the books that she checked
out of the psychology section.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.883
"Nurture-Born Killers,

16:54.947 --> 16:57.484
"Patterns of the Sexual Predator."

16:57.550 --> 17:00.463
Maybe she liked seeing Mark's name in print.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.323
No, that's the thing. Mark's
name wouldn't be in here.

17:03.389 --> 17:06.461
These books are about
chronic sexual offenders.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.903
Mark's strangling of Mandy Johanssen,

17:08.961 --> 17:11.669
it was called a one-time incident,

17:12.265 --> 17:15.303
completely out of character for Mark.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.182
What'd you find?

17:19.238 --> 17:22.013
A clerk said Mrs. Dietrich
checked out newspapers

17:22.074 --> 17:25.544
from the summer of '86 to the fall of '87.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.181
Besides Mandy's murder in September,

17:27.246 --> 17:28.782
there was another Central Park story

17:28.848 --> 17:32.295
that ran that whole year.
The Reservoir Runner.

17:32.952 --> 17:37.697
2 months earlier in July, she was dragged
into the woods and raped by 4 kids.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.165
Maybe Mrs. Dietrich thought Mark
had something in common with them.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.705
Something that made her withdraw from him.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.334
Something that

17:49.368 --> 17:52.645
compelled her to do research 3 weeks ago.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.943
Something she saw or heard.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.385
Well, 3 weeks ago,

17:59.812 --> 18:02.816
that's before he started seeing Chantal.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.657
She said he was with his prison pen pal.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.200
The word she used was skank.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.833
EAMES: What happened with Mark?

18:12.892 --> 18:15.133
GOREN: You corresponded with him for what?

18:15.194 --> 18:16.605
7 years.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.136
Did he open up to you?

18:19.599 --> 18:20.942
About Mandy?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.741
It was an accident.

18:23.736 --> 18:27.013
Mark needs to feel powerful,
but he doesn't need to kill.

18:27.239 --> 18:30.345
If only his mother had given him
that kind of understanding.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.753
I read about what happened to her.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.485
She wasn't good for him.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.187
You met her?

18:36.248 --> 18:38.922
I didn't need to. I saw her apartment.

18:39.819 --> 18:43.528
Lots of beige’s, neutral tones. It's stifling.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.265
When were you in her apartment?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.333
Like 3 weeks ago.

18:50.930 --> 18:54.139
Well, that is interesting,
'cause that's when Mark

18:55.334 --> 18:58.213
said that his mother turned cold on him.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.610
But he couldn't figure out why.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.447
I can.

19:05.011 --> 19:08.254
I left my camera in his room.
She must've seen the video.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.091
A video of you “healing” Mark's wounds?

19:12.351 --> 19:15.594
I helped him give a voice
to his sexual fantasies.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.461
Like what? About

19:21.527 --> 19:22.733
choking

19:24.063 --> 19:27.567
with a scarf, like Mandy?

19:29.035 --> 19:32.949
He had a whole scenario
about silver running shorts

19:33.005 --> 19:35.144
and filling my mouth with sand.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.188
Once you get to know him,
Mark's a very creative soul.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.049
Thanks, Naomi.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.223
We'll be in touch.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.569
The Reservoir Runner was described
as wearing silver running shorts,

19:56.629 --> 20:00.167
but there was nothing in any
of the articles about sand.

20:00.366 --> 20:04.143
Laura Dietrich heard her son's fantasies

20:04.203 --> 20:06.046
about a runner in the park.

20:06.105 --> 20:11.077
She goes to the library and she
confirms some of the details.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.583
And she's a fact-checker.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.923
Her next move would have been to the source.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.723
The detectives who broke the case.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.432
MARSTON: Mark Dietrich's mother? No kidding.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.029
Never made the connection.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.541
She said she was checking facts
for an article on the case.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.440
Which facts in particular?

20:33.499 --> 20:36.207
What the victim was wearing, was she choked?

20:36.268 --> 20:38.145
Did she ask about sand?

20:38.637 --> 20:42.141
She asked if the attacker put
sand in the victim's mouth.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.517
But that wasn't made public, right?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.181
Well, not at the time, no.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.781
This have to do with the murder?

20:47.847 --> 20:50.953
Laura Dietrich might've suspected
her son committed the rape.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.495
It may be why he killed her.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.157
That would be tragic because
he did not do that rape.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.996
My partner and I got those guys.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.037
There was semen found on the victim,

21:00.092 --> 21:02.572
semen that didn't match any of them.

21:03.295 --> 21:06.037
Did Mrs. Dietrich ask about that?

21:06.132 --> 21:08.738
No, but if she did, I would've
told her it was a gang rape

21:08.801 --> 21:10.644
and that we only got 4 of the guys.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.512
Now, maybe Mark Dietrich, the Yuppie Killer,

21:12.571 --> 21:14.573
was running with the homeboys that night,

21:14.640 --> 21:15.880
but I doubt it.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.812
Well, how do you explain that he knew

21:19.345 --> 21:21.951
unpublicized details of the rape?

21:22.181 --> 21:23.922
He was incarcerated in the same facility

21:23.983 --> 21:25.724
with those 4 punks, wasn't he?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.389
Cons tell each other everything.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.127
But like you said, Detective Marston,

21:30.422 --> 21:33.062
you know, I can't imagine a yuppie killer

21:33.159 --> 21:35.662
shooting the breeze with 4 homeboys.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.969
Look, we got taped confessions.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.211
A lot of people worked a lot of hours
to get those animals off the street.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.873
Us guys don't remember
what it was like back then,

21:43.936 --> 21:48.578
but I've had a lot of women tell me they
were afraid to walk out in broad daylight.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.053
Anything I can do, give me a call.

21:56.515 --> 22:01.157
I remember. Marston and his partner
Roscoe were heroes around our house,

22:01.220 --> 22:04.463
the way they got 4 kids
to confess in one night.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.367
Yeah. I'd like to see how they did that.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.441
I'm just saying, Nishan,

22:11.730 --> 22:14.267
your friends are gonna tell the tale.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.838
You finished with that can of
soda? You want another one?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.474
Uh, no.

22:22.241 --> 22:25.347
I ain't mean to leave it there.
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.917
- MARSTON: Come on, you were there.
- Man, I told you,

22:28.981 --> 22:30.790
we didn't go anywhere near the reservoir.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.056
We didn't rape no woman.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.097
You're not helping yourself out, kid.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.327
Your friend Nishan already said
he pulled down her silver shorts.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.663
MONTY: No, that ain't right.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.863
And he said you held down her left leg.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.428
I didn't. I didn't touch her never.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.168
Monty, if you keep denying while all
your friends are cutting deals,

22:45.231 --> 22:46.801
it's gonna go real bad for you.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.868
Don't you wanna help us?

22:48.934 --> 22:50.436
Yeah, I do.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.109
All you gotta say is that
you touched her left leg.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.408
Just touched it.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.318
You don't have to admit
to anything else, just that.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.118
And then you can go home tonight.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.625
Um, do you have the tape of this confession?

23:04.750 --> 23:07.822
They wanted him to say
he touched her left leg.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.662
This is the confession
that played for the jury.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.697
And then Nishan took down
her shorts and got on her.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.898
What'd you do?

23:15.961 --> 23:20.000
I touched her leg. Her right
leg. It's all I did.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.677
Left leg, right leg. The point
is, the kid admitted he was there.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.116
There were inconsistencies
in all 4 confessions.

23:28.173 --> 23:32.246
And not one of them admitted
actually raping her.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.188
Look, if they didn't do it,
if they weren't even there,

23:34.246 --> 23:36.055
why in the world would they confess?

23:36.115 --> 23:38.061
Because they were afraid to disappoint.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.357
Disappoint who?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.591
Marston and Roscoe. Look.

23:48.294 --> 23:52.674
I'm just saying, Nishan, your
friends are gonna tell the tale.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.579
You finished with that can of soda?
You want another one?

23:57.636 --> 23:59.138
Uh, no.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.715
I ain't mean to leave it there. I'm sorry.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.119
So, Marston is drawing
attention to the soda can,

24:05.177 --> 24:07.350
so that when anyone watches it,

24:07.413 --> 24:09.256
they know that Nishan
had something to drink.

24:09.315 --> 24:12.558
So nobody can say he was denied food and
drink. He's being a smart detective.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.622
These kids were interrogated
for 30 hours with no lawyers

24:15.688 --> 24:18.396
and almost no contact with their parents.

24:18.691 --> 24:23.606
Marston's being polite. He's being very nice.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.771
But look...

24:27.166 --> 24:28.509
Look at the kid's reaction.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.446
You got someplace I can throw
it away. I'll clean it up.

24:31.503 --> 24:32.573
I'll clean it up.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.744
The kid thinks that Marston
is reproaching him

24:35.808 --> 24:38.152
for leaving the can on the table.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.282
He is desperately trying
to please the one guy

24:41.347 --> 24:43.827
he thinks can get him out of trouble.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.793
I mean, the jury never saw this.

24:46.852 --> 24:50.561
Never saw the way that Roscoe
and Marston played these kids.

24:50.856 --> 24:53.427
All they saw was the finished product.

24:55.461 --> 24:58.271
These confessions, they're nothing but vapor.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.773
Mark Dietrich is the real thing.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.071
He did this rape.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.386
All 4 recanted their confessions.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.514
Once their lawyers got ahold of them.

25:13.579 --> 25:17.721
Two dozen witnesses saw them in the park,
running in a pack, snatching purses.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.421
Dietrich knew the details.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.931
I agree with Detective Marston's explanation.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.263
Dietrich shared a prison
yard with the 4 rapists.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.802
So, years later, he's having sex,

25:25.858 --> 25:27.929
he just happens to dredge
up what they told him?

25:27.993 --> 25:29.301
Now, that is incredible.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.932
Tales of forcible sex excite him.

25:31.997 --> 25:34.068
EAMES: There's an easy way out of this.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.876
The department still has Dietrich's
DNA from the Mandy Johanssen case.

25:37.936 --> 25:41.577
We run it against the unknown
DNA from the reservoir rape.

25:42.474 --> 25:45.250
I can just feature what
that little psycho told you.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.756
She especially liked the part
about the silver running shorts.

25:47.813 --> 25:51.124
I'm a sack artist. Improvisation
is the key to my creativity.

25:51.183 --> 25:55.097
Almost as much as the bit about
stuffing her mouth full of sand.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.894
If I understand you, you've never
actually seen this alleged video.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.902
No. But his mother did.

26:00.526 --> 26:04.406
She even looked up the true
story that inspired it.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.976
These are the newspaper articles
that she checked out of the library

26:13.038 --> 26:14.483
and books.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.619
That's how she found out about the,

26:19.111 --> 26:20.920
you know, the stuff
about malignant narcissism.

26:20.979 --> 26:24.222
She even called the detective
who investigated the case.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.921
She thought you were good for it.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.464
If she thought that, she would've told me.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.167
- You ever seen this woman?
- No.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.260
You sure?

26:34.493 --> 26:37.474
Your DNA matched the semen
on her running shorts.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.711
Yeah. Okay, yeah, I remember her now.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.808
I met her in the park. So?

26:48.073 --> 26:51.418
We were warming up before
jogging. We started talking,

26:51.677 --> 26:53.020
went back to her apartment.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.250
Where?

26:54.746 --> 26:58.819
All I remember is, it wasn't
close enough. And there was a bed.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.122
We had sex. I must've
dripped on her shorts.

27:02.387 --> 27:05.027
And then she went back to the park to jog,

27:05.090 --> 27:06.865
and I went home to sleep.

27:08.193 --> 27:12.300
What, you had consensual sex with a
runner that you met at the reservoir,

27:12.364 --> 27:17.040
the same night the Reservoir
Runner was raped?

27:17.436 --> 27:20.508
And it never, you know, crossed your mind

27:21.240 --> 27:22.446
to say anything?

27:22.508 --> 27:24.419
Well, how would he know
that's who he had sex with?

27:24.476 --> 27:25.887
Her name and photo were never released.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.287
I still wouldn't have known.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.292
You never exchanged names?

27:29.348 --> 27:30.850
It was the '80s.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.725
Women were a lot more fun.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.323
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:39.458 --> 27:43.531
I don't understand. Is there
some doubt about who raped me?

27:44.963 --> 27:49.343
This man's DNA matched the
semen on your running shorts.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.508
This guy doesn't look like somebody
who'd bash me in the head with a rock

27:54.573 --> 27:56.382
and put sand in my mouth.

27:57.910 --> 28:02.620
Miss Stephens, if you can't
remember anything about the attack,

28:03.582 --> 28:05.687
who told you about the sand?

28:06.752 --> 28:08.425
Detective Marston.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.802
EAMES: So he's kept in touch with you.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.460
He's called every few months.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.433
Has he called you recently?

28:20.799 --> 28:23.006
A couple of weeks ago.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.076
He said he's worried about me.

28:26.838 --> 28:29.648
I didn't know policemen like that existed.

28:34.479 --> 28:37.392
DNA match, huh? Where do
you want me to start?

28:37.449 --> 28:41.295
The samples were improperly stored.
Some genius blew his nose in the petri dish.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.629
You gotta hear Dietrich's explanation.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.760
He hooked up with Jane
Stephens before her run,

28:45.824 --> 28:47.997
went back to her apartment to have sex.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.571
Yeah, I can go with that.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.602
Just for drill, you should check with her.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.667
But she doesn't remember
what happened that day.

28:55.734 --> 29:00.479
He knows that. Because you've monitored
her condition over the years.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.152
You didn't see her that first night.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.654
She lost three-quarters of her blood.

29:06.411 --> 29:10.518
She doesn't need to remember what
they did to her. That's my job.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.056
Detective Marston, we understand
there was extraordinary pressure

29:14.119 --> 29:16.258
to break this case. Those
kids fit a profile...

29:16.321 --> 29:20.428
Forget it. There were no
mistakes, no rush to judgment.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.806
We matched the DNA.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.673
Dietrich has no evidence to back up his story.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.910
The DA says it's open and shut.

29:33.972 --> 29:35.212
You know,

29:35.741 --> 29:39.712
AI Roscoe and I went over to Jane Stephens'
apartment the day after she was raped,

29:39.778 --> 29:42.657
just to look for a number
of her next-of-kin.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.853
We found a condom wrapper
on the floor next to her bed.

29:44.916 --> 29:48.227
Now, maybe, that's what Dietrich
used to have sex with her.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.395
Ask AI Roscoe, I'm sure he'll remember.

29:52.858 --> 29:57.136
He could've just said he was wrong
about the kids, a good-faith mistake.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.469
What's he afraid of?

29:58.530 --> 29:59.600
Yes.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.373
Okay. Thank you.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.073
I found AI Roscoe.

30:05.237 --> 30:09.913
He's at the Saint Albans Parish cemetery
up near Ghent. He died 2 weeks ago.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.288
His handgun discharged
while he was cleaning it.

30:15.714 --> 30:18.092
Wait a minute, I don't understand, Detective.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.959
Why are you volunteering
this information?

30:20.018 --> 30:23.989
Because you're going to find out about
it anyway. It's exculpatory evidence.

30:24.056 --> 30:27.230
Well, was there anything else
besides the wrapper?

30:27.426 --> 30:29.463
- You remember the brand?
- No.

30:29.728 --> 30:34.609
All your boy needs to know, is I
saw a wrapper. The simpler, the better.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.746
Are we clear?

30:39.938 --> 30:42.509
My father didn't like talking about that case.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.919
That's why he moved us up here,
away from all the attention.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.891
We looked at the police report
of your father's death.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.993
It had all the...

30:53.185 --> 30:56.098
the earmarks of an accidental shooting.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.829
He would've done that for you.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.397
For the insurance.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.301
I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

31:11.603 --> 31:15.016
I got this in the mail, the day after he died.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.418
He was police chief here until last year.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.692
I want my kids to remember him as a hero.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.438
"it's something I've been
running from for 15 years.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.743
"Last weekend, Ted Marston called.
It's all going to catch up.

31:44.803 --> 31:48.580
"Before Ted and me began our
interrogation of those young men,

31:48.874 --> 31:50.820
"we agreed that regardless of their innocence,

31:50.876 --> 31:53.015
"we were going to get
confessions out of them.

31:53.078 --> 31:56.753
"That's what we did. Even though
the more we questioned them,

31:56.815 --> 31:59.591
"the more it was obvious
they were innocent.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.760
"I'm ashamed of what I did.
I can't live with it anymore."

32:04.890 --> 32:06.870
Some good-faith mistake.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.330
They premeditated framing those kids.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.807
Marston was looking at
prison time if word got out.

32:13.865 --> 32:17.039
Or if Laura Dietrich got the case reopened.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.554
This letter is of no value as evidence.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.123
Mr. Roscoe isn't here to authenticate
it. It can't be used at trial.

32:32.184 --> 32:36.929
Marston knows that the only person who
can tie him to the frame up is dead.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.826
There's no evidence to tie him
to Laura Dietrich's murder.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.668
And thanks to his condom wrapper story,
we can't even make an ironclad case

32:43.728 --> 32:46.299
against Mark Dietrich for the reservoir rape.

32:46.364 --> 32:49.243
Marston's sitting pretty snug in the saddle.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.804
We need to put a burr under the saddle.

32:53.572 --> 32:57.679
You are considering vacating the
convictions on the rape, aren't you?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.623
I was a kid.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.522
I was trying to keep from going to jail.

33:06.218 --> 33:10.564
Detective Marston said the other guys
were gonna put the weight on me, so

33:10.722 --> 33:12.668
I just said I touched her arm.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.630
Detective Marston suggested you say that?

33:15.694 --> 33:16.798
Yeah.

33:20.565 --> 33:23.205
He said he would try to help
me, so long as I play along.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.875
Mr. Carver, you asked us here
to discuss a new development.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.817
We matched the semen on the
victim's shorts to a suspect we...

33:30.876 --> 33:33.220
we've come to believe acted alone.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.428
Are you preparing to vacate the convictions?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.297
Vacate, what does that mean?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.630
Your record will be clean.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.694
It means, Nishan, that you spent all
those years in prison for nothing.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.263
Ten years because you trusted
Detective Marston.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.970
Well, that changed you in ways
that you never wanted. I...

33:55.233 --> 33:57.941
I don't know what could
compensate you for that.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.574
Oh, I do. I know exactly.

34:02.340 --> 34:07.119
A $100 million. Those punks
are suing for $100 million.

34:07.178 --> 34:10.022
I hear the city and the department
are prepared to settle,

34:10.081 --> 34:13.062
but that proposed settlement
doesn't include you.

34:13.118 --> 34:16.759
You see what's going on here?
I'm being set up.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.802
We need a strategy.

34:19.858 --> 34:23.101
The Detective's Endowment cannot
get involved if you were derelict

34:23.161 --> 34:25.572
or if you acted out of bounds
of your official duties.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.109
What's that supposed to mean?

34:27.165 --> 34:29.668
You're the Detective's
Endowment, I'm a detective.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.940
You'd better just talk to the DA.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.513
I'm gonna go broke defending myself.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.143
You gotta have a talk with the Endowment.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.550
I'm sorry.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.713
Look,

34:39.610 --> 34:43.114
we had suspects. The city was in a panic.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.792
Women couldn't sleep without worrying that
some guy was gonna rape them in their beds.

34:47.851 --> 34:51.129
This isn't fair. These guys were heroes.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.690
We need to stand by our own.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.204
It's not just the DA's office.
It's public perception.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.470
What if we had him help us break Dietrich.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.144
Would that change the perception?

35:02.434 --> 35:05.381
We both saw how he handled
those kids. He's good.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.350
And nobody knows the reservoir
case better than him.

35:08.406 --> 35:09.680
I think she has a point.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.482
What're you talking about here?

35:11.543 --> 35:14.149
We need to get Dietrich on the reservoir rape,

35:14.212 --> 35:16.852
if we wanna get him for his mother's murder.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.954
You want my help?

35:22.020 --> 35:23.124
Yeah.

35:23.488 --> 35:26.059
You'd be staying ahead
of the curve, you know,

35:26.124 --> 35:30.698
doing what you always do, getting
at the truth like any good cop.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.409
All right. All right.

35:34.466 --> 35:38.437
Anything to make sure that the
right guy goes down for the count.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.277
Where you wanna do it?

35:44.109 --> 35:45.918
MARK: We were back there,
when we started talking.

35:45.977 --> 35:50.221
GOREN: No, no, the witnesses said
they saw her warming up around here.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.625
I'm just telling you
what I remember, all right.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.028
Mr. Dietrich, as I explained
to your attorney,

35:55.086 --> 35:57.396
we need to eliminate you
as a suspect in the rape

35:57.455 --> 36:00.299
in order to defend ourselves
against this lawsuit.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.269
How you doing, Detective?

36:05.563 --> 36:08.169
Mark, this is Detective Marston.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.044
He knows this case inside out.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.171
Maybe you've heard of him.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.443
He's the one who got the
confessions out of those kids.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.280
Thanks for helping us out today.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.048
You know, Mark is not so clear on how

36:18.443 --> 36:21.686
him and Jane Stephens
got back to her apartment.

36:21.746 --> 36:22.850
Uh-huh.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.622
This path hooks back up to the traverse.

36:26.384 --> 36:31.197
Her place is on West 81st, so
they would've cut through here.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.800
You okay?

36:36.995 --> 36:39.032
Come on, I'll put my arm
around you. You won't slip.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.667
No, no, no, I...

36:40.832 --> 36:42.368
What's wrong, Mark?

36:42.434 --> 36:44.607
I'm not going down there.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.642
Not with... Not with these on.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.548
Oh, no, sure, sure, sure.

36:50.108 --> 36:51.382
Here you go.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.982
They cleaned it up since the
last time you've been here.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.253
Cut out a lot of the underbrush,

36:57.716 --> 36:59.059
put up a light.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.454
The rocks...

37:01.786 --> 37:03.459
Rocks are still here.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.591
And the ground,

37:06.458 --> 37:07.869
still sandy.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.932
Right over there, is where they found her,

37:13.932 --> 37:17.038
half-dead, barely a pulse.

37:18.536 --> 37:22.416
Look, I don't know anything about that.
I don't wanna stay here.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.447
Mark, you don't wanna help us anymore?

37:25.510 --> 37:27.990
I mean, what are we supposed to make of that?

37:28.046 --> 37:30.492
I told you, all right, I talked to the woman,

37:30.548 --> 37:33.529
we went back to her place
and we had sex, okay?

37:33.585 --> 37:36.691
I mean, didn't you see
the condom wrapper there?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.436
Right? Isn't that what he told you?

37:43.461 --> 37:46.135
I might've confused it with
another rape victim, Mark.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.643
I mean, I work a lot of cases.

37:48.700 --> 37:52.648
But this girl's apartment, the bed
was made, everything was tidy.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.975
The doorman saw her go out.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.914
If he would've seen her come back with you,
don't you think he would've said something?

38:00.545 --> 38:04.721
Why don't you say something? I mean, what
did you let them bring me here for?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.286
- Mark, I think you should...
- What? You're fired, okay?

38:07.352 --> 38:10.492
He sees the writing on the
wall, same as everyone.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.058
You know what you need to do here, Mark?

38:14.425 --> 38:18.305
You need to cut yourself
the best deal you can.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.206
I'm not going back in.

38:20.265 --> 38:24.008
No, there's a way of telling the
story, Mark, that can work for you.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.877
You hooked up with a girl on the path,

38:25.937 --> 38:28.110
you brought her down here
for a little intimacy,

38:28.173 --> 38:29.777
consensual intimacy.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.151
I, I, I see where this is going.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.190
This is a good story, Mark.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.691
Things started developing between you two,

38:36.748 --> 38:39.126
and all of a sudden, she hurt you.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.264
Squeezed you a little too
hard, got too tough,

38:42.554 --> 38:43.658
and you lost it.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.702
The sex was consensual. A straight
assault with mitigation,

38:46.758 --> 38:48.203
isn't that right, Counselor?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.466
Under those circumstances, yes.

38:50.762 --> 38:54.175
And all you gotta say, Mark, is she hurt you.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.613
She hurt you, and you got scared.
Isn't that the way it happened?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.241
You say it, and everything falls into place.

39:01.306 --> 39:04.378
She hurt you, and you got scared.

39:08.646 --> 39:12.116
She hurt me. I got... I got scared.

39:13.384 --> 39:16.092
Look, I didn't wanna hurt her.

39:16.788 --> 39:21.134
I just... I got scared. I got scared.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.005
That's very good. You're almost home free.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.939
All that's left to talk
about is, is your mother.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.310
My mother?

39:33.972 --> 39:38.614
Well, you helped Detective
Marston clear up his old case.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.990
Now he wants to help you with this
other thing. I mean, we all do.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.418
I didn't... I didn't kill my mother.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.656
What you said is, you don't remember.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.661
What's it gonna look like to a jury?

39:52.523 --> 39:56.437
Please tell him that he has
practically no chance with a jury.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.973
You have to stay out of court, my friend.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.510
You have to talk to us.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.105
I would... I wouldn't kill her.

40:05.169 --> 40:07.513
It's obvious you care about your mother.

40:07.572 --> 40:11.748
Even in death, you cared
about her, you had respect.

40:13.044 --> 40:17.424
You remember? You remember what you
told me that morning that you saw her

40:17.982 --> 40:19.427
in her nightgown?

40:20.285 --> 40:21.958
About her modesty?

40:23.054 --> 40:26.433
Oh, he was so concerned
about her being covered.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.764
I mean, doesn't that say something?

40:29.827 --> 40:32.899
Tells me, you're a good son, Mark.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.444
The way you pulled her nightgown down.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.379
After she was dead, to cover her.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.283
A good son would do that, a respectful son.

40:45.877 --> 40:46.981
Yeah.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.950
How did you find out about that stuff?

40:53.451 --> 40:57.900
Isn't that what you're talking about?
It was pulled down over her panties.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.467
You tell me.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.833
It was bunched up like this?

41:06.831 --> 41:08.902
Maybe in the heat of the moment, you...

41:08.967 --> 41:10.969
You just forgot to do it.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.407
Maybe you thought about pulling
it back down, you know,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.919
so you could implicate someone.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.022
Someone like Mark.

41:29.554 --> 41:32.125
And what, you were in too much of a hurry,

41:32.190 --> 41:35.103
you just forgot to yank it back down?

41:36.127 --> 41:39.108
You think that I killed... What,
you think I'd kill her? You're nuts!

41:39.163 --> 41:43.873
As we speak, we're executing search warrants
on your home, your office, your car.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.471
Oh, no, no, this is bull.

41:45.536 --> 41:48.574
Yeah, no, we staged the picture 4 weeks ago.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.111
We pushed the nightgown
back up just to trick you.

41:54.445 --> 41:57.756
What're you coming after me for? You
got this loser here, he's good for it.

41:57.815 --> 42:01.627
Yeah, for the fact he didn't do it. You did.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.363
You're under arrest for murder.

42:05.423 --> 42:08.529
You son of a bitch, you killed her.
You killed my mother!

42:08.593 --> 42:10.129
Get out of here.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.730
You'll never make it stick.

42:11.796 --> 42:14.333
A cop killing a witness,

42:15.266 --> 42:16.836
isn't that the death penalty?

42:16.901 --> 42:18.471
It certainly is.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.347
What you're gonna wanna do here, Ted,

42:24.409 --> 42:26.582
is cut the best deal you can.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.151
There is a window of
opportunity, Mr. Marston.

42:30.214 --> 42:34.060
But given what you've put this city through,
I'm not disposed to leave it open longer.

42:34.118 --> 42:37.463
You have from here back up to
that path to make up your mind.

42:47.465 --> 42:48.569
Okay.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.179
I'll take the deal.

42:51.869 --> 42:53.280
I'll take it.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.907
I'll get back to you.

43:05.183 --> 43:08.824
This must've been a very
lonely place 15 years ago.
