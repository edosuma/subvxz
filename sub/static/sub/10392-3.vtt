the news or appears in a

a particularly vibrant

mix of Spanish, European,
Afro-Caribbean,

02:19.673 --> 02:22.742

02:22.743 --> 02:24.177
These are deep waters my friends

02:24.178 --> 02:26.012
no news story or episode of

02:26.013 --> 02:28.548
Miami vice has ever come
close to navigating.

02:28.549 --> 02:32.685
It is and always has been a

02:32.686 --> 02:33.953
fiercely, fiercely proud country

02:33.954 --> 02:35.922
and its people yearn to see

02:35.923 --> 02:36.590
international coverage of

02:36.591 --> 02:39.526
something other than
cocaine and violence.

02:39.527 --> 02:44.431
But that isn't a legacy
that is easy to ignore.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.799
Its decades of civil unrest have

02:46.800 --> 02:48.768
left vast swaths of Colombia

02:48.769 --> 02:51.371
relatively unknown even
to its own citizens.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.306
To reach a place previously

02:53.307 --> 02:55.542
considered a no go area, I'll

02:55.543 --> 02:59.612
fly out of an airport in

02:59.613 --> 03:00.581
Villavicencio 45 miles southeast

03:00.582 --> 03:04.451
of the capital city of Bogota.

03:04.452 --> 03:07.987
On first inspection, this is an

03:07.988 --> 03:09.055
airplane bone yard where

03:09.056 --> 03:11.424
unwanted props from romancing

03:11.425 --> 03:17.330
the stone corrode artfully.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.633
But in reality, this sleepy

03:20.634 --> 03:22.469
hangar is an important gateway

03:22.470 --> 03:29.175
to the more impenetrable
parts of the country.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.943
The remote settlements in the

03:30.944 --> 03:31.745
Amazon basin are cut off from

03:31.746 --> 03:33.012
the country with neither rail

03:33.013 --> 03:34.914
nor roads connecting them.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.784
There are only two ways in,

03:37.785 --> 03:39.185
either boat for several days

03:39.186 --> 03:40.820
down river or aboard a jungle

03:40.821 --> 03:44.324
bus which is what locals call

03:44.325 --> 03:50.530
the world war ii era D.C. 3.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.131
I've been brought here by

03:52.132 --> 03:54.767
Pablo Mora a teacher at the

03:54.768 --> 03:56.469
university and a particular

03:56.470 --> 03:59.439
enthusiast for this classic
of golden age aviation.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.673
You've taken this flight before?

04:00.674 --> 04:01.208
Yes.

04:01.209 --> 04:06.145
Every time I have a chance
I come here and fly one.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.814
It is a romantic thing.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.517
He sees the work these
hulking great air ships and

04:10.518 --> 04:12.218
their pilots do as daredevil

04:12.219 --> 04:13.553
humanitarian missions for the

04:13.554 --> 04:17.156
more remote Colombians.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.825
An in flight movie?

04:18.826 --> 04:19.527
No.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.394
Nor first class either.

04:20.394 --> 04:20.793
What?

04:20.795 --> 04:28.795
No, no.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.003
The planes travel with their

04:31.004 --> 04:32.739
own mechanic to cobble together

04:32.740 --> 04:35.475
anything that might go wrong
and stuff can go wrong.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.076
The risk is that we'll be able

04:37.077 --> 04:38.978
to land but not take off again.

04:38.979 --> 04:46.979
So this guy is our return
ticket out of the jungle.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.732
Our captain is something of a

04:59.733 --> 05:07.733
legend in these parts and
his copilot copilot.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.012
It's mystical.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.714
They develop this
sensibility with the plane.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.949
There is no Intel, no software.

05:16.950 --> 05:24.190
They have GPS but
that's about it.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.125
It's beautiful.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.359
They have to sense everything.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.461
They know when the sound
of the plane is not right.

05:28.462 --> 05:36.462
It's just man and machine.

05:36.904 --> 05:41.741
The weather is the big
unknown and it is changeable

05:41.742 --> 05:42.710
enough to ground planes in

05:42.711 --> 05:50.711
remote places if they
hang around for too long.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.154
We have to make one stop on the

05:55.155 --> 05:57.924
way to pick up more cargo.

05:57.925 --> 06:05.925
Vital cargo, by the way.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.276
While we're passing over this

06:17.277 --> 06:18.745
beautiful and lush area the life

06:18.746 --> 06:21.414
of those below has
been anything but.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.784
Colombia seems to be trapped
in a vicious circle.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.354
The territory is used as
a haven for kidnappers.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.857
Until recently most of the
news out of this part of

06:30.858 --> 06:31.692
Colombia was not good.

06:31.693 --> 06:34.927
It was a front line in the war

06:34.928 --> 06:36.596
on drugs, for lack after better

06:36.597 --> 06:40.600
term and Colombia's long

06:40.601 --> 06:44.704
struggle with the Marxist drug

06:44.705 --> 06:45.972
cartel with kidnapping and

06:45.973 --> 06:46.807
assistance from Venezuela.

06:46.808 --> 06:48.608
50 years of very dirty war.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.777
The stakes not about drugs per

06:50.778 --> 06:53.613
Se but about the ability of

06:53.614 --> 07:01.614
ordinary Colombians
to live without fear.

07:02.956 --> 07:07.727
We land in the Jung the out post

07:07.728 --> 07:13.399
of Mirraflores in the
amazonian forest preserve.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.902
The heavy presence of army and

07:15.903 --> 07:17.504
special police is a result of

07:17.505 --> 07:19.071
the strategic location and

07:19.072 --> 07:21.874
recent history as a one-time

07:21.875 --> 07:25.244
center of Coca production.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.245
Farmers would grow the stuff and

07:26.246 --> 07:27.747
make the leaves into paste.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.717
Traffickers would
come and buy it.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.251
The FARC had this area under its

07:32.252 --> 07:37.256
sphere of influence for years.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.357
Nine years ago the government

07:38.358 --> 07:41.393
moved to expel the FARC,
traffickers, and any

07:41.394 --> 07:43.530
paramilitaries with
apparently much success.

07:43.531 --> 07:48.267
Overnight, however, its
population shrank by 85% and

07:48.268 --> 07:56.268
what remains struggles
to survive.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.955
You're telling me the
people were born here?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.690
Most of the people
came from elsewhere.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.725
In the beginning in the 1950s

08:12.726 --> 08:15.427
and '6 Os they were escaping

08:15.428 --> 08:17.063
from the violence, from the

08:17.064 --> 08:18.264
political violence between the

08:18.265 --> 08:19.365
two parties in Colombia.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.434
So if you were having
problems in the city or in

08:22.435 --> 08:24.671
wherever you were from
you came out here.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.472
Yeah, yeah.

08:25.473 --> 08:27.907
So what did you do for
a living out here?

08:27.908 --> 08:30.977
Cattle and some agriculture

08:30.978 --> 08:32.879
and after that the drug trade

08:32.880 --> 08:38.818
began and everything with
the Coca plantation.

08:38.818 --> 08:39.787
This climate is good for it?

08:39.788 --> 08:40.986
Very good.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.321
Since 1999 there was no police

08:42.322 --> 08:44.056
or army force here so it was

08:44.057 --> 08:46.793
just occupied by the FARC.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.895
And then by the paramilitary.

08:48.896 --> 08:49.162
Yeah.

08:49.163 --> 08:57.163
So that is when the
real violence began.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.241
So the problem preexisted
the drug trade.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.343
The drug trade just
made everything more.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.512
There is no judge here,
few institutions.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.513
Basically you know the state is

09:07.514 --> 09:09.949
here just because
the army is here.

09:09.950 --> 09:16.322
So I think when I
met the major...

09:16.323 --> 09:17.857
Anthony, this is the major.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.492
Julio Cesar Gonzalez is the

09:20.493 --> 09:22.962
current mayor of Miraflores

09:22.963 --> 09:25.698
which has seen much better
and much worse days.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.700
How many people
live in this town?

09:27.701 --> 09:33.906
Around 1500, 2,000
in the community.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.207
The FARC were here for 20 years

09:35.208 --> 09:40.880
and they were the
central authority here.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.148
Not doing particularly well,

09:42.149 --> 09:43.683
not particularly happy
with the government.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.684
Somebody comes along and offers

09:44.685 --> 09:48.054
you a nice machine gun
and a cool scarf.

09:48.055 --> 09:48.656
Yeah.

09:48.657 --> 09:50.690
Especially if you're
15, 16 years old.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.391
That's a pretty
attractive offer.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.060
Of course it is.

09:53.061 --> 09:55.828
Even if they say you'll
probably be dead by the time

09:55.829 --> 09:56.129
you're 25.

09:56.129 --> 09:56.664
It is.

09:56.665 --> 09:57.964
And they offer you a salary.

09:57.965 --> 10:05.965
So what is the
future of this town?

10:11.311 --> 10:15.748
They're providing free

10:15.749 --> 10:18.751
education but there is a little

10:18.752 --> 10:21.988
potential of diversity
and Eco tourism as well.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.390
Without the customer, there

10:24.391 --> 10:27.593
is no cocaine trade
and no violence.

10:27.594 --> 10:27.795
Right?

10:27.796 --> 10:31.898
So is the United States and

10:31.899 --> 10:32.999
Europe still buying cocaine?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.867
I can't think about the

10:34.868 --> 10:36.769
situation where the demand
is not going to be there.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.338
But the demand in the
states is down 40%.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.107
As long as there is a market

10:41.108 --> 10:49.108
there will be people
ready to do it.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.685
The United States puts how many

10:52.686 --> 10:54.754
billions of dollars a year

10:54.755 --> 10:57.256
paying for guns and uniforms
and training, etcetera.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.290
Where should they
be spending it?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.792
I would say health is very

10:59.793 --> 11:01.027
important but more important is

11:01.028 --> 11:02.428
to end the war on drugs.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.930
It's just, it doesn't work.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.298
Here is my problem.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.134
If crack didn't exist I would

11:08.135 --> 11:11.570
have no... I have
absolutely agree with you.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.473
But as a former coke addict and

11:14.474 --> 11:15.975
crack head, that is a problem.

11:15.976 --> 11:16.476
Yeah.

11:16.477 --> 11:17.609
The thing is that people think

11:17.610 --> 11:19.645
that if you think that drugs

11:19.646 --> 11:21.748
should be legalized you're
saying they're good.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.149
No.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.050
We're not saying that.

11:23.051 --> 11:26.085
But just we're just getting
rid of one problem.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.154
The problem the major has here.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.656
A lot of money you could divert.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.558
We have two problems.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.459
I agree.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.993
One is drug addiction and the

11:33.994 --> 11:35.161
other is drug trafficking.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.328
We'll get rid of one.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.629
We won't get rid of the other.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.098
We have to deal with it forever.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.833
It is a beautiful country.

11:40.834 --> 11:45.404
The people here are, from
I've seen are really nice.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.672
Even the bad guys are charming.

11:46.673 --> 11:47.007
Yeah.

11:47.007 --> 11:47.607
That is true.

11:47.608 --> 11:48.608
The food is delicious.

11:48.609 --> 11:55.748
The problem is the United
States will never leave.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.249
Complicated issues.

11:56.249 --> 11:56.583
Yeah.

11:56.584 --> 11:57.917
So the good people of this

11:57.918 --> 11:59.251
town can thank us for bringing

11:59.252 --> 12:03.622
in their fresh
supply of... yeah.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.191
Coca.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.026
Nothing of it, gentlemen.

12:06.027 --> 12:07.327
It was really our pleasure.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.278
> Bogota the country's capital

12:26.279 --> 12:29.115
and a city with new
lofty food ambitions.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.449
Where previously a restaurant

12:30.450 --> 12:33.552
scene didn't really exist.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.822
Now young restaurant owners such

12:35.823 --> 12:37.990
as this musician turned chef are

12:37.991 --> 12:45.991
beginning to make a name for
themselves in Colombia.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.539
One of the biggest
markets in Bogota.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.474
I love this place.

12:54.475 --> 12:55.475
It is very beautiful.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.343
The colors.

12:56.344 --> 12:58.377
My mom comes here
to buy flowers.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.380
My grandma also.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.984
Did I mention this city
is over 8,000 feet up?

13:04.985 --> 13:08.988
Hence the altitude
sickness I'm feeling.

13:08.989 --> 13:09.756
Not good.

13:09.757 --> 13:11.223
Tomas comes here a few times a

13:11.224 --> 13:12.491
week for an early breakfast

13:12.492 --> 13:20.492
which I'm hoping will
make me feel better.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.102
This market has been running in

13:23.103 --> 13:25.037
one form or another
since the 1940s.

13:25.038 --> 13:30.209
This place is huge.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.011
Want some juice?

13:31.011 --> 13:31.444
Yeah.

13:31.445 --> 13:32.678
What do you have?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.013
I love it.

13:34.014 --> 13:41.187
Orange juice with carrots.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.190
Probably the healthiest
thing I've had in a while.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.092
Good for the high altitude.

13:46.093 --> 13:46.693
Yeah.

13:46.694 --> 13:47.759
This is better.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.528
I'm feeling better every hour.

13:49.529 --> 13:49.930
Yeah.

13:49.931 --> 13:51.463
The first hour is killing me.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.032
But you have a better face.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.033
I didn't think I was going to

13:54.034 --> 13:55.734
make it out of the airport.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.204
Most of the mornings, early

13:58.205 --> 13:59.371
in the morning 5:00 to 6:00 in

13:59.372 --> 14:02.541
the morning I climb
the mountain.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.542
Why?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.543
Fresh air.

14:04.544 --> 14:04.878
Okay.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.712
You have to come with me.

14:06.713 --> 14:11.783
Hell no.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.220
Ain't happening.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.423
You want to taste this?

14:17.424 --> 14:21.727
This is made with corn.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.794
It is fantastic.

14:22.795 --> 14:30.795
I love it.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.575
Tucked in the back corner of the

14:36.576 --> 14:37.843
fish market is a place that

14:37.844 --> 14:39.845
serves breakfast to the market's

14:39.846 --> 14:42.114
workers and shoppers.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.916
We're talking beef short ribs

14:43.917 --> 14:46.085
simmered in an oily broth with

14:46.086 --> 14:49.188
potatoes, salt, and scallions.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.457
Tomas swears by this stuff, the

14:51.458 --> 14:58.264
traditional breakfast
soup from the region.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.365
There we go.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.799
Okay.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.034
Gracias.

15:01.035 --> 15:04.536
Would you like chili?

15:04.537 --> 15:05.537
I do.

15:05.538 --> 15:12.378
Gracias.

15:12.379 --> 15:12.612
Yeah.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.013
Now we're talking.

15:13.014 --> 15:15.114
This is perfect when you have

15:15.115 --> 15:16.515
a good party last night.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.818
I was just going to say,
this is hangover food.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.787
I know hangover food
well and this is good.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.956
Perfect.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.524
Some meat in there.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.026
Yeah.

15:26.027 --> 15:27.693
Good broth.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.561
Yes.

15:28.561 --> 15:28.795
Good.

15:28.796 --> 15:32.131
So what is this dish called?

15:32.132 --> 15:37.903
Beef stock... broth over rib.

15:37.904 --> 15:38.405
Yes.

15:38.406 --> 15:40.472
With potatoes of course.

15:40.473 --> 15:47.747
Even with potato.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.849
Very good Spanish.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.051
I don't speak Spanish.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.154
I speak a little Mexican.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.244
Bogota, back in the '90s a very

16:18.245 --> 16:20.846
dangerous and violent
place to be.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.182
Today, not so much.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.783
Today in my repeated experiences

16:24.784 --> 16:29.888
here kind of awesome.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.690
This is the recently renovated

16:31.691 --> 16:33.625
old city where I meet up with

16:33.626 --> 16:35.294
Hector, distinguished author and

16:35.295 --> 16:37.363
one of the most important and

16:37.364 --> 16:40.366
supremely talented writers
in Latin America.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.268
Hector's recent work, a memoir

16:42.269 --> 16:44.203
called "oblivion" is about his

16:44.204 --> 16:45.604
father who was killed for his

16:45.605 --> 16:53.605
outspoken attempts to change
things for the better.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.316
First of all, where are we?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.919
This is a place where many

17:00.920 --> 17:01.888
Bogotans come to eat something

17:01.889 --> 17:03.122
in the middle of the morning or

17:03.123 --> 17:04.756
the middle of the afternoon.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.825
The tomales here are made

17:06.826 --> 17:08.394
with chicken and pork belly

17:08.395 --> 17:09.560
combined with vegetables, rice,

17:09.561 --> 17:11.463
and massa wrapped in a banana

17:11.464 --> 17:14.300
leaf and slow cooked for hours.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.167
This place has been serving

17:16.169 --> 17:19.570
chocolate to the politicians of

17:19.571 --> 17:23.509
nearby Plaza for a
couple hundred years.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.944
Here are the tomales.

17:25.944 --> 17:26.313
Beautiful.

17:26.314 --> 17:28.347
It is a thing of
beauty isn't it?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.516
Let's see if it is
like my mother's.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.118
Oh, that's a high standard.

17:32.119 --> 17:36.855
I suppose it is not.

17:36.856 --> 17:41.927
I was just to the
market yesterday.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.996
What economy there was at

17:44.997 --> 17:46.265
Miraflores was a drug economy.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.434
Now the drugs are gone
and there is no economy.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.936
It is a ghost town with the

17:50.937 --> 17:52.204
military and people sitting

17:52.205 --> 17:53.272
there staring at space waiting

17:53.273 --> 17:55.174
for beer to arrive
best I can understand.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.109
Tell me something hopeful.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.476
I think we are becoming more

17:57.477 --> 18:01.046
and more conscious that this

18:01.047 --> 18:04.650
past decades of violence have

18:04.651 --> 18:12.651
been absolutely useless.

18:13.393 --> 18:17.296
And that we have to change
many, many, many things.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.132
So I think it is not as
good as my mother's.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.000
I'm sorry.

18:21.001 --> 18:24.336
Well, it never is.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.737
If you remove cocaine from

18:25.738 --> 18:27.139
the equation, remove the drug

18:27.140 --> 18:28.740
trade as a financial engine, you

18:28.741 --> 18:31.310
would still have serious

18:31.311 --> 18:34.980
divisions over ideology here.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.415
Is that improving?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.850
Things are changing in a good

18:38.851 --> 18:42.888
direction, but very slowly.

18:42.889 --> 18:46.258
I think.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.160
You know, ten years ago they

18:48.161 --> 18:51.330
killed 7,500 people every year.

18:51.331 --> 18:55.667
And three years ago this number

18:55.668 --> 18:59.538
came to 700 people killed.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.573
So the situation changed.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.175
Right.

19:02.176 --> 19:03.442
I have only questions.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.743
I have no answers.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.412
I'm so sorry.

19:05.413 --> 19:09.915
If I were the president, I
really... I don't know.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.350
You wouldn't know what to do.

19:11.351 --> 19:11.618
No.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.352
I wouldn't.

19:12.352 --> 19:12.919
I wouldn't.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.422
To suggest that a nation
should expand its social

19:16.423 --> 19:17.756
services, do its best to lift

19:17.757 --> 19:22.861
people out of poverty, to
provide medical care for

19:22.862 --> 19:24.530
everyone, as you well know, that

19:24.531 --> 19:29.235
may be in the minds of many.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.571
Are those as dangerous and

19:32.572 --> 19:36.542
potentially ideas
as they used to be?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.710
Well, 25 years ago my father

19:38.711 --> 19:42.047
was killed just because he was

19:42.048 --> 19:43.715
asking for these basic things

19:43.716 --> 19:49.221
like clean water, a glass of

19:49.222 --> 19:52.123
milk, and a bath
for every child.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.625
That was... we still don't have

19:53.626 --> 19:56.127
that and we need that.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.497
Now we in Colombia,
maybe we are trying.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.232
I think there are some people

20:00.233 --> 20:01.567
here even in the government who

20:01.568 --> 20:09.568
are working for that.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.593
> Bogota is the largest city

20:27.594 --> 20:29.628
in Colombia and the economic
heart of the country.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.197
About a fifth of the
population lives here

20:32.198 --> 20:33.599
many of them very well.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.868
But some not so well.

20:36.869 --> 20:43.309
It's a city with a marked
north/south divide.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.043
Chef Tomas and his restaurant

20:45.044 --> 20:47.679
sit side by side in the macarena

20:47.680 --> 20:55.287
neighborhood where the city
center meets the north.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.489
The lunch Tomas is serving us

20:57.490 --> 20:59.525
here is defined more by high

20:59.526 --> 21:02.528
quality fundamentals than
by high concept theories.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.963
If there is a theme here, it's

21:04.964 --> 21:07.165
that ingredients this good,

21:07.166 --> 21:08.800
meticulously prepared, are the

21:08.801 --> 21:15.206
essence of great eating.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.208
It's a beautiful space.

21:17.209 --> 21:20.479
So how is the restaurant
business in Bogota?

21:20.480 --> 21:21.847
It's a big business.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.651
A lot of people don't
know how to cook.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.752
Nobody cooks at home.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.720
Maybe their cook does.

21:27.721 --> 21:28.721
They eat out a lot?

21:28.722 --> 21:32.391
Yeah.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.559
It's a new culture.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.394
Everybody wants to go
to the restaurant.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.096
Ten, 15 years ago what,
traditional, casual food?

21:38.097 --> 21:39.331
Yeah.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.033
A few fine dining, white

21:42.034 --> 21:44.235
table cloths, continental or

21:44.236 --> 21:45.504
Italian, but this is new?

21:45.505 --> 21:47.238
This is a new business.

21:47.239 --> 21:54.946
A new world.

21:54.947 --> 22:00.519
It is the mixture
of the cultures.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.253
It's beautiful.

22:02.254 --> 22:06.057
The other thing is all of the

22:06.058 --> 22:07.626
region with the rivers and the

22:07.627 --> 22:11.029
sea we are like a big farm, a

22:11.030 --> 22:12.931
beautiful farm to send all this

22:12.932 --> 22:16.468
produce to the world.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.137
I believe more in a beautiful

22:19.138 --> 22:23.775
carrot than a great recipe.

22:23.776 --> 22:29.080
Yeah.

22:29.081 --> 22:29.816
Right.

22:29.817 --> 22:32.083
This is pasta.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.385
Thin sheets of hand made

22:33.386 --> 22:35.454
pasta are filled with cheese and

22:35.455 --> 22:42.160
finished with a cherizo sauce.

22:42.161 --> 22:42.328
Yum.

22:42.329 --> 22:44.129
So you used to be a musician.

22:44.130 --> 22:44.431
Yeah.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.164
I am still.

22:45.164 --> 22:45.565
Still.

22:45.566 --> 22:46.598
So what happened, man?

22:46.599 --> 22:52.804
How did you go from
music to restaurants?

22:52.805 --> 22:53.473
Money.

22:53.473 --> 22:53.806
Good.

22:53.807 --> 22:54.807
Good, yeah.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.141
Really good.

22:55.142 --> 22:56.475
It's great business is good

22:56.476 --> 22:57.976
because generally speaking the

22:57.977 --> 22:59.511
only worse idea I think I'll try

22:59.512 --> 23:01.279
to make a living making music is

23:01.280 --> 23:06.685
I think I'll make a living
opening a restaurant.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.687
I see why that's so popular.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.022
Good stuff.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.491
Thank you, Tony.

23:12.492 --> 23:18.464
Tomas's take uses beef shank

23:18.465 --> 23:21.500
instead of veal which is braised

23:21.501 --> 23:24.102
overnight with wine and
broth in a wood fired oven.

23:24.103 --> 23:24.837
Oh, wow.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.873
It's huge.

23:27.874 --> 23:28.040
Yes.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.675
You don't need the knife.

23:29.676 --> 23:33.378
Only the spoon.

23:33.379 --> 23:41.379
Right.

23:49.128 --> 23:49.295
Hum.

23:49.296 --> 23:51.196
Do you cure this first in salt?

23:51.197 --> 23:51.698
No.

23:51.699 --> 23:52.831
Dry it, salt it?

23:52.832 --> 23:53.899
No.

23:53.900 --> 23:58.003
Just fresh?

23:58.004 --> 23:58.370
Yes.

23:58.371 --> 23:59.905
Delicious.

Santiago Decali is a city of

24:29.368 --> 24:31.336
southwest Colombia known for its

24:31.337 --> 24:34.372
proximity to the pacific
coast and its semitropical

24:34.373 --> 24:34.707
temperatures.

here for the climate.

Colombian sport.

Thank you.

25:15.214 --> 25:21.319
What do you call this object?

25:21.320 --> 25:22.588
Taiho.

25:22.589 --> 25:29.060
Hence the name... taiho.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.396
I should be good at this.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.397

dish sink from across
the room for years.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.804

without hitting it.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.138
Oh.

25:39.139 --> 25:44.910
That doesn't sound like any fun.

Everyone has a different
style it seems.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.647

25:48.648 --> 25:56.454
and then another and swing.

I don't believe that style
is going to work for me.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.994
to accompany it with this.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.128

countries in one.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.810
When you come to Colombia you

31:52.811 --> 31:55.880
definitely have to go to some

31:55.881 --> 31:57.648
pacific experience either in

31:57.649 --> 32:00.351
Cali or go straight to the coast

32:00.352 --> 32:03.321
to have a Caribbean experience.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.992
You definitely have to have a

32:06.993 --> 32:09.327
mountain experience like Bogota.

32:09.328 --> 32:09.628
Right.

32:09.629 --> 32:11.629
Another would be like
go to the Amazon.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.232
Go to the jungle.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.967

32:15.968 --> 32:16.235
Yeah.

are afraid to come.

32:35.187 --> 32:41.692

or Puerto Rico or...

32:41.693 --> 32:42.594
South central?

32:42.595 --> 32:43.828
My impression is no.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.364
When you go to Rio you
don't wear a big watch.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.933
You don't wear an
expensive suit.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.601
You don't behave like an idiot

32:50.602 --> 32:53.504
and life is going to be good.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.441
Like maybe I've been lucky

32:56.442 --> 33:00.245
but I've never been
mugged or robbed.

33:00.246 --> 33:03.881

had an amazing time.

33:03.882 --> 33:04.949

33:06.718 --> 33:08.219

33:08.220 --> 33:10.021

33:10.022 --> 33:11.456
the beach and we, it was great,

33:11.457 --> 33:12.557
and we want to come back.

lot of heart here.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.727

or FARC or paramilitary.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.425

34:20.426 --> 34:21.659
independent politically and live

34:21.659 --> 34:26.630
pretty much by their own code.

35:30.596 --> 35:38.102

intestines of the goat.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.371
They slaughter them back here

35:40.372 --> 35:43.241

36:07.267 --> 36:08.399
this one is for breakfast, and

36:08.400 --> 36:10.701
it's almost done where
they are slaughtered.

Let me set the scene.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.847
It's hot out here, desert hot.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.383
We plan to ride three hours

37:32.384 --> 37:34.118
along the coast to our lunch

37:34.119 --> 37:35.520
spot, and I ate salty goat

37:35.521 --> 37:36.987
innards for breakfast, and I

37:36.988 --> 37:40.658
refuse to wear a
helmet or sunblock.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.660
We avoid wild donkeys and goats,

37:42.661 --> 37:47.465
and get lost more
than a few times.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.633
So a little heatstroke leads to

37:48.634 --> 37:50.901
a lot of horsing around.

37:50.902 --> 37:57.643
We decide to open
these puppies up.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.993
> A momentary concussion
is seldom a good thing.

38:15.994 --> 38:21.098
Waking up in Colombia on a
beach almost always is.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.100
♪

38:23.101 --> 38:24.835
Having abandoned the epic ride,

38:24.836 --> 38:27.705
we're back where we started in

38:27.706 --> 38:33.277
the Guijira at the
blue sea restaurant.

38:33.278 --> 38:33.945
How come you're all clean?

38:33.945 --> 38:34.780
I changed.

38:34.781 --> 38:38.949
You brought a change of clothes?

38:38.950 --> 38:39.217
Yes.

38:39.218 --> 38:41.452
I'm hurting now.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.120
I'm feeling every minute, every

38:42.121 --> 38:46.023
hour, every month
and year of my age.

38:46.024 --> 38:46.592
So you're ready?

38:46.592 --> 38:47.526
Yes.

38:47.527 --> 38:48.859
I trust it will make
me feel all better.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.027
Much better.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.296
It's a good end to a fun day.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.731
You can't ask for
better scenery.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.966
It's beautiful here.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.970
A beer.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.607
I need the anesthetic
qualities of the local fire

39:02.608 --> 39:03.141
water.

39:03.142 --> 39:04.575
That's probably a
really good idea.

39:04.576 --> 39:07.412
That's going to be a
good start for tonight.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.113
A good start.

39:09.114 --> 39:09.948
I'm done.

39:09.949 --> 39:11.081
Oh, man.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.483
That dog has the right idea.

39:12.484 --> 39:15.319
See, I'd be very happy if
that was me right now.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.487
Just like laying down in the

39:16.488 --> 39:18.756
sand with my chin out like that.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.758
Man, it's so beautiful here.

39:20.759 --> 39:24.495
Who comes here?

39:24.496 --> 39:25.596
Basically tourists from

39:25.597 --> 39:26.731
Colombia and backpackers that

39:26.732 --> 39:33.337
are making their way
up to the north.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.505
Right.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.673
We saw one tourist all day,

39:35.674 --> 39:39.109
and it's nice, really it's
completely off the grid.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.346
This used to be a
fisherman village.

39:42.347 --> 39:42.948
There are definitely worse

39:42.949 --> 39:44.915
places to eat seafood than

39:44.916 --> 39:47.452
beachside in a fishing village,

39:47.453 --> 39:48.519
and the strength of this area

39:48.520 --> 39:51.422
lies in the variety
of fish available.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.658
Basically it's like a fish

39:53.659 --> 39:59.029
chowder, made with
shrimp, clams.

39:59.030 --> 39:59.364
Right.

39:59.365 --> 40:03.033
A small kind of clam,
a lobster, fish.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.170
Yeah.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.638
And conch.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.039
I need a bath.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.675
Very clear sky for
the Caribbean.

40:10.676 --> 40:12.142
Oh, yeah.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.544
Oh, man.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.979
Always accompanied by lemon

40:14.980 --> 40:16.681
and coconut rice and plantain

40:16.682 --> 40:19.550
and some hot sauce in there.

40:19.551 --> 40:25.790
♪

40:25.791 --> 40:32.062
Some good food, a few shots,
the sounds of waves in the

40:32.063 --> 40:33.498
background, and a nice sunset.

40:33.499 --> 40:36.033
These are things in my
experience that will set most

40:36.034 --> 40:38.302
things right.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.737
Thank you to Guajira.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.506
And Colombia.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.508
Salud.

40:43.509 --> 40:47.978
Cheers.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.581
♪

40:50.582 --> 40:51.182
We had good fun.

40:51.183 --> 40:55.853
We had good fun.

40:55.854 --> 41:03.561
Cheers.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.563
Snoes

41:07.833 --> 41:11.235
I always find
Colombia encouraging.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.670
They face problems more extreme

41:12.671 --> 41:14.071
and seemingly more intractable

41:14.072 --> 41:17.775
than many of us can imagine, and

41:17.776 --> 41:22.613
yet every time I come
here it gets better.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.615
Don't get me wrong.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.451
Problems, serious problems,

41:27.452 --> 41:29.119
remain, which is particularly

41:29.120 --> 41:31.722
heartbreaking in a country so

41:31.723 --> 41:34.559
beautiful, so generous, so

41:34.560 --> 41:39.630
proud, so eager to love
and be loved back.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.131
I come back to my own country

41:41.132 --> 41:44.068
from Colombia, and I think if

41:44.069 --> 41:45.703
they can fix that, if they can

41:45.704 --> 41:47.104
make things better, then surely

41:47.105 --> 41:54.478
there's nothing we can't do.

41:54.479 --> 41:57.616
For now, however, I'll settle
for fixing my headache.
