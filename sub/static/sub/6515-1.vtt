WEBVTT

02:15.470 --> 02:17.472
All right, you gumballs.

02:27.732 --> 02:29.275
Stay right there.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.425
<i>Ain't never done that before.</i>

02:56.886 --> 02:57.846
<i>Attention.</i>

02:58.054 --> 03:00.849
<i>Hear this...
you are about to violate</i>

03:01.057 --> 03:03.810
<i>intergalactic
bio-preservation laws.</i>

03:04.394 --> 03:09.524
<i>Bounty hunter 0601127,</i>

03:09.732 --> 03:11.192
<i>Earth sector.</i>

03:11.526 --> 03:16.531
<i>You are in violation
of mandate E102.</i>

03:16.781 --> 03:17.740
Violation?

03:20.285 --> 03:21.411
Charlie.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.454
Ug?

03:24.622 --> 03:25.874
Is that you in there?

03:26.541 --> 03:30.086
- Charlie, my friend.
- Wow.

03:30.295 --> 03:33.548
- Wow. It's great to see you.
- And you as well.

03:41.055 --> 03:41.973
You're looking good.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.225
We just received your bio-alert.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.853
Yeah, yeah.
What was that all about?

03:47.061 --> 03:50.940
You are in violation
of zoological mandate E102,

03:51.149 --> 03:53.943
Clause 14, paragraph 5,
items 6 and 7.

03:54.152 --> 03:54.861
Huh?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.405
Specifically,
you are prohibited

03:57.697 --> 03:59.824
from terminating
any trans-galactic life-form

04:00.033 --> 04:02.493
if it means total extinction
of the species.

04:02.869 --> 04:04.454
Oh, yeah.
But they're dangerous.

04:04.704 --> 04:06.289
You taught me how
dangerous they are.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.291
Aggression factor is irrelevant.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.377
Those two eggs
are the last two eggs.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.713
The intergalactic council
has dispatched

04:13.963 --> 04:15.590
a specimen collection pod.

04:15.924 --> 04:17.382
<i>You are instructed
to place the eggs</i>

04:17.591 --> 04:19.802
<i>into the receptacle in the pod.</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:24.015
The council is sending
a pod here?

04:24.515 --> 04:25.516
Come on, Ug...

04:25.934 --> 04:28.728
Good luck, Charlie, my friend.

04:29.395 --> 04:31.439
Yeah, but Ug...
Ug!

04:31.856 --> 04:34.442
Wait a second.
What am I supposed...

04:36.027 --> 04:36.945
Ug!

04:39.239 --> 04:40.323
Ug.

05:29.289 --> 05:30.373
Okay.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.501
All right, put these
in over here.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.243
<i>Specimen retrieval unit empty.</i>

06:08.745 --> 06:12.332
Hey! Hey, wait a second!
Wait a minute!

06:14.334 --> 06:15.585
Off, please.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.963
Oh, no!
Not again!

06:21.799 --> 06:24.469
Hey! I don't want
to go nowhere!

08:33.222 --> 08:36.225
<i>Ethan! Move it.</i>

08:36.433 --> 08:37.977
<i>Get your ass on deck.</i>

08:43.732 --> 08:45.109
I'm sorry, Captain...

08:46.777 --> 08:48.070
I can't hear you.

08:57.455 --> 08:58.956
20 more days.

09:09.759 --> 09:12.803
Sublight shuttle and Earth.

09:15.223 --> 09:16.265
See you soon, Dad.

09:36.327 --> 09:38.579
Goddamn it, Bernie,
keep us out of that stuff.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.373
<i>Hey, I'm not the pilot, Rick.</i>

09:41.290 --> 09:42.416
<i>- Fran!
- I'm on it.</i>

09:42.625 --> 09:43.459
Al Bert...

09:44.126 --> 09:46.003
<i>Where's your so-called
apprentice?</i>

09:50.007 --> 09:52.718
Looks like 12 degrees
to make about 35 burn.

09:52.927 --> 09:55.471
<i>Roger. I got it.
Give it to me in five.</i>

09:57.557 --> 10:00.977
Ethan, I know you are there.

10:01.227 --> 10:03.020
<i>On deck. Pronto.</i>

10:03.521 --> 10:05.106
Acknowledge.
I'm on my way.

10:08.985 --> 10:10.653
<i>Looks like a live one.</i>

10:11.112 --> 10:12.405
<i>Is it hollow?</i>

10:17.952 --> 10:19.412
<i>No can say.</i>

10:21.414 --> 10:22.915
<i>What's it doing out here?</i>

10:23.124 --> 10:25.543
Looks beat up.
Trajectory's pretty weird.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.670
It weighs about a ton
and a half.

10:28.588 --> 10:31.841
It could be a space probe.
Or an escape pod.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.843
Whatever it is,
it's a ton and a half

10:34.051 --> 10:35.052
more beer money
than we got now.

10:35.303 --> 10:38.347
So, do we do, or do we don't?

10:43.311 --> 10:44.228
Yeah.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.482
Bernie, go down to the bay

10:48.691 --> 10:51.068
and let's see if we can
put a track on this.

11:00.161 --> 11:01.287
<i>Shit.</i>

11:04.665 --> 11:05.916
It won't scan.

11:08.336 --> 11:09.795
<i>I can't tell you what's inside.</i>

11:10.004 --> 11:11.047
Okay.

11:12.548 --> 11:13.633
Where are you going?

11:14.884 --> 11:15.885
Well, sir...

11:16.802 --> 11:19.013
if you simply must
possess this thing,

11:19.221 --> 11:21.140
then I must go downstairs
and make sure

11:21.349 --> 11:23.434
that the gravity panels
still drag in a ton and a half.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.686
- Okay?
- Just...

11:26.812 --> 11:27.772
Make it so.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.066
Aye, aye, Captain.

11:52.046 --> 11:53.381
- Hey!
- Huh?

11:53.631 --> 11:56.008
Number one...
you're late.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.345
Number two...

12:01.514 --> 12:02.973
Who told you
you could wear those?

12:05.518 --> 12:07.228
- You did.
- I did?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.063
Yeah.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.651
Well, your lease is up.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.165
I guess Rick's had a little
too much coffee again?

12:28.416 --> 12:31.252
Rick has got a bug up his butt.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.838
See? He's gone

12:34.547 --> 12:36.382
and discovered himself...

12:37.425 --> 12:39.593
a magnetic space anomaly.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.804
And he's gotten stiff
in the jock.

12:43.347 --> 12:46.267
And you, my friend...

12:46.892 --> 12:49.145
must learn to at least

12:49.687 --> 12:51.856
pretend a bit

12:52.064 --> 12:53.691
of servitude.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.735
Just like you?

13:01.866 --> 13:04.243
It's life in space, kiddo.
Catch you in five.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.703
Aye, aye.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.247
Tractor power up.
Online in five.

13:08.748 --> 13:09.915
<i>Roger that.</i>

13:12.626 --> 13:14.003
Two kilos and closing.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.300
1500.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.478
Tell Bernie to get ready
to lock, Captain.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.898
Oh, there you are.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.567
Can't you hear the bridge
in your stateroom?

13:37.693 --> 13:38.486
<i>Rick!</i>

13:39.695 --> 13:41.363
<i>Tractor power's
reading 90 on the line.</i>

13:41.614 --> 13:43.699
<i>- Better get ready, folks.
- Got it.</i>

13:43.908 --> 13:46.494
<i>Pull out when I say,
and not before.</i>

13:47.787 --> 13:49.663
<i>Better grab it fast.
She's going.</i>

13:49.997 --> 13:51.290
<i>I don't know if she's
got the guts, Rick,</i>

13:51.540 --> 13:52.833
<i>but she's all yours.</i>

13:58.172 --> 13:59.465
<i>Give me two more degrees.</i>

14:00.758 --> 14:03.677
Come on, Bernie!
Lateral! Lateral!

14:06.972 --> 14:08.224
Spin it around if you have to.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.434
Just don't give me
any new dents.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.728
Clamps are out,
but they look sluggish.

14:12.937 --> 14:13.729
Al Bert.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.731
The clamps are freezing up.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.025
I got the de-icer boots
working, sir.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.863
Thank you...
Ethan, the engineer.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.786
<i>Dropping.
5.9, she's steady.</i>

14:28.994 --> 14:30.955
<i>All right.
We've got it.</i>

14:34.250 --> 14:37.211
Okay, boys and girls.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.589
Let's reel it in
and see what we won.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.437
<i>Okay, it's hollow.</i>

14:55.813 --> 14:58.107
<i>Agnometer reading 35,</i>

14:58.566 --> 15:01.235
<i>40, 55.</i>

15:04.572 --> 15:06.115
<i>Jeez, it's real cold inside.</i>

15:06.323 --> 15:07.616
<i>- About 10, 12 degrees.</i>
- Hold it.

15:07.867 --> 15:08.659
Um...

15:08.868 --> 15:10.911
Could you ask Bernie
to go back a little?

15:11.120 --> 15:13.372
You can ask him
to go back, Ethan.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.457
There's nothing there.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.502
<i>It's just a corrosion swirl.</i>

15:18.711 --> 15:22.256
- Bernie, acknowledge.
- Is that you, Ethan?

15:22.548 --> 15:23.716
Yeah, Bernie, this is me.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.093
Listen, could you move
the camera back manually?

15:26.302 --> 15:27.261
<i>A little slower.</i>

15:28.679 --> 15:30.055
<i>Uh... more.</i>

15:30.806 --> 15:32.016
<i>More.</i>

15:34.810 --> 15:38.147
<i>A bit more.
Stop.</i>

15:41.609 --> 15:42.318
It's rust.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.695
Magnify times four, please.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.368
Now it's great big rust.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.499
Bernie, um...

15:58.042 --> 16:00.002
aim a blower
at that section there.

16:00.336 --> 16:03.339
<i>Anything for you, madame pilot.</i>

16:07.384 --> 16:10.763
Look, right there.
You see?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.308
It's a factory stamp.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.353
<i>Foundry marking.</i>

16:19.855 --> 16:20.856
No, it isn't.

16:25.069 --> 16:27.404
It's the old
intergalactic council stamp.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.367
- Before they dissolved?
- Yeah, the old logo.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.619
Aw, come on. Who cares?

16:35.704 --> 16:38.457
If it belongs to somebody else,
then it's not salvage.

16:38.666 --> 16:41.251
<i>We got to report it,
S.O.P., Captain.</i>

16:41.835 --> 16:43.462
We still get paid.

16:48.092 --> 16:49.134
Okay.

16:50.970 --> 16:51.804
I'll log it.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.264
<i>I don't want another
stolen property</i>

16:54.473 --> 16:56.266
<i>rap up my ass again.</i>

16:58.894 --> 17:00.938
<i>Bernie, get yourself up here.</i>

17:05.317 --> 17:07.277
Well, somebody must
own the thing.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.739
Al Bert, talk to me.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.117
Ahhh...

17:15.327 --> 17:17.538
<i>Nothing on any
of the registration channels.</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:18.789
<i>It's not been listed
missing with central</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:20.665
<i>in the last 15 years at least.</i>

17:22.626 --> 17:25.462
<i>Hold on.
I think I've got something.</i>

17:28.966 --> 17:31.552
<i>ID transmit incoming.
Standby.</i>

17:39.393 --> 17:40.269
TerraCor.

17:40.477 --> 17:45.107
Third quarter profits,
403 trillion new bucks.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.067
<i>Huh, what do they want?</i>

17:47.943 --> 17:50.237
Ahoy, RSS Tesla.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.699
Do I have the honor of speaking
to Captain Richard Buttram?

17:54.116 --> 17:56.493
- Right here.
- It's a pleasure, Captain.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.370
I am counselor Tetra.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.372
- Of TerraCor.
- Correct.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.833
And on behalf of TerraCor,
may I be the first

18:03.042 --> 18:04.918
to congratulate you
and your crew

18:05.210 --> 18:07.713
<i>for locating something
we lost a long time ago</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:10.382
<i>and frankly, thought
we'd never retrieve?</i>

18:10.799 --> 18:11.967
We are very grateful.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.677
Give me a break.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.180
Just how grateful
might TerraCor be?

18:16.388 --> 18:19.725
Captain, permit me
to put your mind at ease.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.270
Your location is just three days
from one of our stations.

18:23.479 --> 18:24.938
I am well aware of the
profit margin

18:25.189 --> 18:27.066
of an operation such as yours.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.692
So we are prepared
to offer you

18:28.901 --> 18:31.236
triple the rate
in straight salvage,

18:31.528 --> 18:33.822
in cash at our station.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.407
Well, Counselor,
you do understand

18:35.616 --> 18:37.159
that I need to establish
the chain of title

18:37.367 --> 18:39.453
from the Intergalactic Council
to TerraCor.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.081
<i>So, I suggest
we get back in touch</i>

18:42.289 --> 18:44.541
<i>when we arrive at Orion Colony.</i>

18:44.875 --> 18:46.293
Excuse me, Counselor, could you
hold for a moment?

18:46.502 --> 18:48.545
We're getting some breakup
on this end.

18:48.754 --> 18:49.546
Certainly.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.592
Take it!
Don't fool with these guys.

18:53.801 --> 18:55.469
This isn't one of your schemes,
all right?

18:55.719 --> 18:57.262
We're involved in this, too.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.890
I'm not real fond of the idea

19:00.099 --> 19:02.726
of messing TerraCor over
either, Captain.

19:02.935 --> 19:06.355
- The offer is fair, Rick.
- The offer is shit!

19:07.314 --> 19:10.526
<i>It's got to be worth
at least 10 times that much</i>

19:10.734 --> 19:13.195
<i>if we unload it at Orion Colony.</i>

19:15.155 --> 19:16.490
We got a goldmine here.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.326
I can smell it.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.453
I can sure smell something.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.081
I... I agree with Rick.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.208
- <i>What?!</i>
- What's that?

19:26.542 --> 19:27.626
I mean, the Captain.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.341
- No way, Rick.
- She's right.

19:36.844 --> 19:37.678
Bernie?

19:38.679 --> 19:41.223
I think we should do
what she says, Captain.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.234
Counselor.

19:53.652 --> 19:54.444
There you are.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.572
Your transmit is
quite clean now.

19:56.780 --> 19:57.948
You do understand,

19:58.198 --> 20:00.033
we'll need the coordinates
for your station.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.620
Already taken care of.
Hope to see you soon, Captain.

20:04.163 --> 20:06.832
<i>And, Captain, please ensure
that no one on your crew</i>

20:07.040 --> 20:08.834
<i>makes any attempt
to breach the pod,</i>

20:09.042 --> 20:11.545
<i>or interfere with it in any way.</i>

20:23.307 --> 20:24.558
What's your problem?

20:26.059 --> 20:27.519
Three days off course.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.313
That's going to set us back
at least a week.

20:29.521 --> 20:32.524
- Maybe more.
- So what?

20:32.733 --> 20:34.193
You got a date or something?

20:35.944 --> 20:38.071
<i>Well, then prepare
for course correction.</i>

20:45.495 --> 20:46.997
Are we there yet?!

20:53.170 --> 20:54.880
"Why, I'm here with TerraCor.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.341
"You know Counselor Tetra,
of course.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.595
<i>"Close family friend."</i>

21:04.139 --> 21:06.850
"Yes, I'm the man
who found the pod.

21:07.643 --> 21:09.603
<i>"Actually, I first
laid hands on it."</i>

21:10.687 --> 21:13.440
God. You're perfect.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.485
<i>Welcome, RSS Tesla,</i>

21:16.693 --> 21:20.697
<i>to TerraCor station 44.
You may call me Angela.</i>

21:21.031 --> 21:24.284
<i>Please complete decontamination
procedures before disembarking.</i>

21:24.493 --> 21:25.202
I don't know about you,

21:25.452 --> 21:26.787
but she's the first one
I want to meet.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.790
<i>Then proceed to lock number 42.</i>

21:34.294 --> 21:35.879
<i>Welcome, Gentlemen.</i>

21:42.344 --> 21:44.972
Gentlemen, problem.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.185
Ugh, this place
smells like a wet sock.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.311
Blowers are working,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.313
filters just haven't
been changed.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.358
Ethan, check
the main scrubbers, will you?

21:56.608 --> 21:58.652
- Rick.
- Aye, aye.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.530
I don't think
there's anybody here.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.618
Nobody alive at least.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.413
Computer.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.209
Hey, what was that chick's name?

22:15.460 --> 22:16.545
Angela.

22:19.131 --> 22:22.551
Angela!
Where's the staff?

22:22.759 --> 22:25.470
<i>Our staff is available
on a 24-hour basis</i>

22:25.679 --> 22:28.056
<i>- to serve your every need...</i>
- Cancel.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.144
Give me current status
of this station's

22:32.352 --> 22:34.563
life support systems.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.607
<i>Atmosphere fabrication</i>

22:37.816 --> 22:39.151
<i>functioning at 60%...</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:41.945
Bernie, Ethan,
get back to the ship.

22:42.154 --> 22:45.032
I want masks, backup air
and power packs for everyone.

22:45.741 --> 22:46.742
<i>And, Bernie...</i>

22:48.535 --> 22:49.745
Bring me the gun.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.415
<i>Have a good day
and enjoy your stay with us.</i>

22:53.623 --> 22:54.541
Angela?

22:56.293 --> 22:58.003
Has TerraCor been notified

22:58.170 --> 23:00.422
about the condition
of this station?

23:01.423 --> 23:02.966
<i>TerraCor Interplanetary was</i>

23:03.175 --> 23:04.593
<i>founded by Maximillian...</i>

23:04.843 --> 23:05.761
Cancel.

23:06.845 --> 23:07.596
Rick.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.265
<i>The computer's fucked up.</i>

23:10.474 --> 23:14.603
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind, Angela. I love you.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.813
<i>Why, that's very kind of you.</i>

23:17.022 --> 23:18.899
<i>I wonder what hit this place?</i>

23:23.862 --> 23:26.573
Place wasn't attacked,
it was abandoned.

23:47.677 --> 23:48.470
Okay.

23:53.183 --> 23:54.434
Okay.

23:54.976 --> 23:58.772
We got 85% power.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.567
Two levels functioning.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.404
No breaks in the seals.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.781
No integrity breaches.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.201
Levels...

24:12.327 --> 24:14.204
Five through seven are on

24:14.413 --> 24:16.581
automatic shutdown
to conserve power.

24:16.790 --> 24:20.544
And so are levels nine
through 12.

24:21.753 --> 24:22.754
I got...

24:24.464 --> 24:26.091
air conditioning,

24:26.299 --> 24:29.136
but I can't do anything
about ambient temperature.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.721
<i>Water tanks are down
by one half.</i>

24:33.223 --> 24:34.891
I got...

24:36.768 --> 24:40.313
a pharmacy on level four.

24:40.522 --> 24:44.526
And executive suites
are on this level...

24:44.734 --> 24:47.779
And we can get to them.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.661
Sporadic audio, some video.

24:55.036 --> 24:58.039
Central logic is 50%.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.958
Nearly Neanderthal.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.836
I guess Angela
ain't going to college.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.130
And the station is drifting

25:05.338 --> 25:08.592
at about one half
a degree a month.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.428
Nice of TerraCor to tell us
the station was decomm.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.934
<i>What? Hello?!</i>

25:18.143 --> 25:22.647
Nuclear core is reading
just shy of the red.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.399
<i>Nearly to alert.</i>

25:27.444 --> 25:28.653
Radiation?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.324
<i>Negative.</i>

25:32.532 --> 25:36.077
It looks more
like natural decay.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.830
I'd give her about a month

25:39.039 --> 25:42.250
before we all glow in the dark.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.336
Don't kid about shit like that.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.339
Just show me
where the pharmacy is.

25:47.839 --> 25:48.632
What's the matter?

25:49.716 --> 25:52.969
Feeling a little bit
under the weather there?

25:53.178 --> 25:54.095
<i>Angela.</i>

25:54.304 --> 25:57.182
Tell me which way
to the wet showers.

25:57.516 --> 25:58.600
<i>Showers are available...</i>

26:24.584 --> 26:25.627
Check it out.

26:30.799 --> 26:31.841
Out!

26:32.926 --> 26:35.095
This is for big boys.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.125
Come here.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.192
You mind your own
goddamn business.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.834
- Asshole.
- Eh...

27:48.918 --> 27:50.503
Captain asshole.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.483
<i>Caution. A maverick energy</i>

28:53.733 --> 28:56.653
<i>discharge has been monitored
in cargo bay two.</i>

28:57.696 --> 29:00.782
The station just cut a fart.

29:03.159 --> 29:08.498
Angela, give me a deck
by deck scan,

29:08.707 --> 29:13.378
and read off all individuals
not currently in main control.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.422
<i>I do not recognize
your voice pattern</i>

29:15.630 --> 29:16.756
<i>as one with security
clearance...</i>

29:16.965 --> 29:21.636
Great, be a shitty TL54!
Don't cooperate!

29:29.269 --> 29:30.270
Angela...

29:32.021 --> 29:34.190
give me security clearance
to all levels, please.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.693
<i>I cannot conform
to your request as I do not</i>

29:36.901 --> 29:39.946
<i>recognize your voice pattern
as one with security clearance.</i>

29:43.241 --> 29:45.785
Angela, do not...

29:46.745 --> 29:48.788
I repeat, do not give me

29:48.997 --> 29:51.541
security clearance
to all levels.

29:54.127 --> 29:56.337
<i>You have
security clearance on all levels.</i>

29:57.297 --> 29:58.173
- Yes!
<i>- What information</i>

29:58.423 --> 29:59.799
<i>do you require?</i>

30:00.216 --> 30:01.509
Exactly...

30:01.718 --> 30:03.720
like my ex-wife.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.639
Anything I say...
she does the opposite.

30:11.311 --> 30:14.272
Come on, open up, you bitch!

30:16.858 --> 30:17.734
<i>I have registered another</i>

30:17.942 --> 30:20.987
<i>maverick energy discharge

30:21.196 --> 30:23.448
It must be one of them
subsection power lines

30:23.656 --> 30:25.992
shorting out
in the condensation.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.953
Go down to the cargo bay,
split it off

30:29.162 --> 30:32.040
and dump it in one of those
dead grids, would you, Ethan?

30:32.248 --> 30:33.208
Aye, aye.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.518
Down, please.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.813
<i>Down is a
relative direction in space.</i>

30:55.021 --> 30:57.857
<i>Do you require
a specific deck or area?</i>

30:58.066 --> 30:59.359
Take me to the Tesla.

31:01.653 --> 31:04.405
<i>Please state the registry
number of the Tesla now.</i>

31:06.741 --> 31:09.452
RSS Tesla, registry...

31:10.411 --> 31:12.705
Shit. Um...

31:13.456 --> 31:16.501
Take me to the ship that
most recently docked here.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.462
<i>This is an elevator, not a dock.</i>

31:19.796 --> 31:21.714
<i>Please state your destination.</i>

31:21.923 --> 31:23.675
All right.

31:24.133 --> 31:27.679
Take me to
the visiting ship dock.

31:29.931 --> 31:32.809
<i>Ship's doctors will be
found on deck four,</i>

31:33.017 --> 31:34.185
<i>- corridors 11 and...</i>
- Cancel!

31:37.814 --> 31:41.985
Take me to the loading dock.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.113
<i>Do you require B level
service docks...</i>

31:45.572 --> 31:46.656
Come on, Angela.

31:46.865 --> 31:50.577
.<i>..the B113 docks,
sublevels four through eight,</i>

31:50.785 --> 31:53.788
<i>- for oversized shipments or...</i>
- I can't get out of here, can I?

31:55.290 --> 31:57.584
<i>Please state
your destination now.</i>

32:21.149 --> 32:23.359
No, don't be on fire!

32:33.536 --> 32:34.537
Jeez.

32:40.043 --> 32:41.002
Rick?

32:42.754 --> 32:43.588
What are you doing?

32:50.345 --> 32:52.263
What happened
to "Captain..."

32:53.848 --> 32:56.976
- Squirt?
- What is your problem with me?

32:57.185 --> 32:59.979
Problem?
What's my problem?

33:00.188 --> 33:01.940
I'll tell you
what my problem is.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.900
- Rick.
- Sit down!

33:08.780 --> 33:10.448
We all had a chance back there.

33:10.657 --> 33:11.866
All of us!

33:12.116 --> 33:15.662
But they... those people,
they've fucked it up.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.831
- W-wh...
- Shut up. Damn it.

33:23.544 --> 33:25.588
See, I understand you
better than you think.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.006
<i>You're young.</i>

33:27.966 --> 33:29.926
You figure you've got
lots of chances.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.053
Right.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.355
Let me tell you something...

33:43.940 --> 33:47.944
there will come a time
when those chances run out.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.572
And then where are you, huh?

33:56.995 --> 33:57.954
Ethan...

33:59.372 --> 34:01.833
What do you say
to getting out of here...

34:03.167 --> 34:05.920
right now, huh?

34:07.088 --> 34:10.174
What about the others?

34:16.764 --> 34:17.806
Well...

34:18.516 --> 34:20.101
on the other hand...

34:24.647 --> 34:26.232
I think I've come up
with a solution

34:26.440 --> 34:27.942
to your little problem.

34:28.693 --> 34:30.027
What problem?

34:33.989 --> 34:37.452
See?
It's all fixed.

34:54.427 --> 34:56.179
Hang around awhile, kiddo.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.389
I'll be gone soon enough.

35:25.708 --> 35:26.918
Hey, hey, hey!

35:29.045 --> 35:30.713
Hands off me!

35:30.922 --> 35:34.175
Wow, thanks.
I almost got locked...

35:39.680 --> 35:40.640
Ohh...

35:41.474 --> 35:43.476
I'm in space, aren't I?

35:46.229 --> 35:49.357
Are you it? Just you?

35:55.738 --> 35:58.074
Better be something
other than you in there.

36:05.456 --> 36:09.043
<i>Don't move.
Stay right there.</i>

36:22.849 --> 36:24.267
<i>Holy cow.</i>

36:44.871 --> 36:45.872
Hmm?

37:02.972 --> 37:03.723
The eggs.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.085
<i>Attention, third notice.</i>

38:56.294 --> 38:59.672
<i>I'm registering another
maverick energy discharge.</i>

39:01.966 --> 39:03.759
Angela, do not,

39:04.010 --> 39:06.929
I repeat do not
characterize the discharge.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.265
<i>The energy discharge
is conformed</i>

39:09.473 --> 39:12.393
<i>to a type two
Rendel Pickman beam blaster.</i>

39:13.686 --> 39:15.271
That's Rick's big macho gun.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.871
He's going for the pod.

39:32.038 --> 39:35.541
<i>That jerk's trying
to rip off the pod.</i>

39:37.001 --> 39:39.795
Ethan.
I sent Ethan down there.

39:41.797 --> 39:42.548
Let's go.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.102
Who are you?

40:02.151 --> 40:02.943
<i>Bernie.</i>

40:04.570 --> 40:07.573
Bernie! Bernie!
Cut that out and come with us.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.951
- What's the matter?
- Rick! Cargo bay.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.995
Seems our fearless leader
has some plans

40:13.204 --> 40:15.122
for TerraCor's long-lost pod.

40:15.331 --> 40:17.166
You mean steal it?
Steal what's inside?

40:17.416 --> 40:20.294
Yup, leave us here counting
REMs as we glow in the dark.

40:20.544 --> 40:22.213
Scumbag.
Are you sure?

40:25.883 --> 40:28.386
- Jeez, what did you do to him?
<i>- Me? Nothing.</i>

40:28.719 --> 40:30.763
<i>That was the critters.</i>

40:31.263 --> 40:32.890
I'm a bounty hunter,
and I got a job to do.

40:33.099 --> 40:35.768
Just tell me who you are.
God, are you from the station?

40:35.976 --> 40:37.103
Wait, wait,
what are you talking about?

40:37.353 --> 40:38.312
A bounty hunter?

40:39.230 --> 40:40.398
Look, are you
from the station or

40:40.606 --> 40:42.108
part of the security team
or something?

40:42.316 --> 40:43.818
How far from Earth are we?

40:45.027 --> 40:45.903
Are you from Earth?

40:46.904 --> 40:49.407
Of course I'm from Earth.
Where are you from?

40:49.907 --> 40:51.700
Well, I'm sorry, I've never...

40:52.326 --> 40:54.662
My Father's there.
I think.

40:55.246 --> 40:57.915
Hold it.
You've never been to Earth?

40:58.124 --> 40:59.875
No, I'm...

41:00.376 --> 41:02.378
- Wait a minute.
- What?

41:17.560 --> 41:18.686
You an alien?

41:19.603 --> 41:22.064
No, do I look like one?

41:23.858 --> 41:24.692
Never mind.

41:36.287 --> 41:37.496
Here, hold this.

41:53.095 --> 41:54.847
- What are we doing?
- Shh!

41:56.098 --> 41:57.892
I got a job to do.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.064
What happened?

42:04.899 --> 42:06.025
<i>Oh, no.</i>

42:14.950 --> 42:15.993
Where's Ethan?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.710
Ethan!

42:25.920 --> 42:27.463
<i>Ethan!</i>

42:28.672 --> 42:29.840
<i>Ethan!</i>

42:37.223 --> 42:38.182
Not so fast.

42:38.390 --> 42:39.558
Would you give me a break?

42:41.602 --> 42:43.103
What do these things look like?

42:45.314 --> 42:47.650
- What do they look like?
- Yeah.

42:48.651 --> 42:49.985
You ever see a piranha?

42:51.195 --> 42:52.238
It's a fish, right?

42:52.446 --> 42:53.447
That's right.

42:53.656 --> 42:55.449
They look nothing
like a piranha.

42:55.658 --> 42:57.910
But they're hungry
like a piranha.

43:03.707 --> 43:06.418
Whoa!
Now watch these ducts.

43:07.628 --> 43:09.547
They love ducts.

43:46.375 --> 43:47.543
Ahh!

43:50.421 --> 43:51.922
"Dr. McCormick."

43:52.965 --> 43:53.757
You know...

43:54.508 --> 43:57.636
- I don't even know your name.
- Um... Charlie.

43:58.345 --> 43:59.263
I'm Ethan.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.308
Nice to meet you.

44:07.021 --> 44:08.147
What do you think
of the coat here?

44:25.748 --> 44:27.041
You... Charlie?

44:29.001 --> 44:31.003
- Hey, look at this.
- Shh.

44:32.004 --> 44:33.339
They're close.

45:05.162 --> 45:06.413
<i>Where are we?</i>

45:15.839 --> 45:16.965
Yeah.

45:18.342 --> 45:20.219
<i>We used to collect specimens
like these.</i>

45:21.929 --> 45:24.390
- Where?
- Oh...

45:33.482 --> 45:35.234
Hello? Fran?

45:35.943 --> 45:36.568
<i>You are engaging</i>

45:36.819 --> 45:38.696
<i>- in unauthorized communication.</i>
- Is anyone there?

45:39.071 --> 45:41.281
<i>This is a restricted
access facility.</i>

45:41.490 --> 45:42.616
Who is that?

45:43.075 --> 45:44.827
Somebody I'm starting to hate.

45:45.786 --> 45:46.578
A lot.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.105
You know, Char...

46:15.649 --> 46:16.400
Char... Charlie?

46:21.530 --> 46:23.532
Charlie, where are you?

46:24.408 --> 46:25.159
Charlie?

46:32.124 --> 46:34.376
Charlie, where...

46:36.170 --> 46:37.546
- Hey!
- Oh!

46:40.424 --> 46:41.759
I could use some help up here.

46:42.509 --> 46:43.927
- In there?
- Yeah.

46:44.136 --> 46:45.137
Oh.

46:46.013 --> 46:49.349
No way.
I'm not going in there.

46:50.184 --> 46:52.352
Well, suit yourself.

47:09.328 --> 47:10.245
Shit!

47:12.456 --> 47:13.332
Charlie!

47:35.020 --> 47:36.522
Charlie!

47:52.204 --> 47:54.248
Charlie?
Charlie, where are you?

48:03.590 --> 48:05.259
What? What?

48:05.467 --> 48:06.260
Ahh!

48:08.053 --> 48:10.430
No, Charlie.
It's okay. It's dead.

48:11.723 --> 48:14.434
<i>Attention, refuse tube A442</i>

48:14.601 --> 48:17.813
<i>is now filled to capacity and

48:18.063 --> 48:19.231
Jettison sequence?
What's that?

48:23.819 --> 48:25.571
- Charlie, Charlie...
- Relax.

48:25.779 --> 48:26.822
I think this thing
is getting ready

48:27.072 --> 48:28.115
to throw us out into space.

48:28.323 --> 48:31.702
- Just relax.
- Angela!

48:32.035 --> 48:34.913
Angela, don't complete the
jettison cycle.

48:35.122 --> 48:35.998
- That's all, don't!

48:39.918 --> 48:41.420
We're not waste material!

- <i>If you were not waste material,</i>
- No, wait!

48:43.338 --> 48:45.549
<i>you would not be
inside the refuse tube.</i>

<i>Jettison sequence will begin

48:49.845 --> 48:53.098
Help! Help!

48:54.099 --> 48:56.393
Wait, wait. Look.

48:56.768 --> 48:58.395
Okay, I see it.

48:59.605 --> 49:01.106
- Lift me up.
- Get on my shoulders.

49:02.107 --> 49:04.109
Up you go.
Get it open.

49:04.401 --> 49:05.319
Get it open.

49:05.903 --> 49:07.654
<i>15 seconds to full jettison.</i>

49:07.863 --> 49:09.615
Hurry up. Go!

49:11.158 --> 49:13.368
- <i>I can't get it, Charlie.</i>
- Yes, you can. Go!

49:13.577 --> 49:14.703
<i>Go! Go!</i>

49:14.912 --> 49:17.164
- Charlie, it won't open.
<i>- Full jettison in 10 seconds.</i>

49:17.372 --> 49:18.290
<i>Go!</i>

49:18.498 --> 49:19.875
<i>Nine seconds.</i>

49:20.500 --> 49:21.460
<i>- Eight seconds.

49:21.668 --> 49:22.544
Wait a second.

49:22.753 --> 49:24.463
- <i>Seven seconds.</i>
- Angela!

49:24.630 --> 49:26.006
Angela, jettison us now.

49:26.214 --> 49:28.216
- That's an order. Do it now.
<i>- 5 seconds...</i>

49:28.425 --> 49:29.176
No, wait a second.
I don't think

49:29.384 --> 49:31.094

<i>3 seconds.
2...</i>

50:03.585 --> 50:05.045
What was it, Rick?

50:06.088 --> 50:07.422
Where'd you hide it?

50:10.842 --> 50:13.261
You were trouble then
and you're trouble now.

50:14.262 --> 50:15.180
<i>Bernie!</i>

50:16.556 --> 50:17.891
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

50:18.725 --> 50:19.768
<i>Come on.</i>

50:20.644 --> 50:23.480
- Ethan?
- Yeah, Bernie, open the grate.

50:24.064 --> 50:25.816
Come on, man, open it.

50:26.525 --> 50:27.192
<i>Open it up.</i>

50:27.401 --> 50:29.111
What the hell are you
doing in there, you idiot?

50:29.319 --> 50:30.404
Just open the grate.

50:35.575 --> 50:37.536
Jeez.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.038
Who the hell are you?

50:44.793 --> 50:48.213
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit.

50:48.422 --> 50:51.299
Bernie! Cool it.

50:54.803 --> 50:57.264
All right, Charlie.

50:59.474 --> 51:02.352
How did you get into the pod?

51:02.686 --> 51:03.562
<i>Hmm?</i>

51:04.312 --> 51:05.981
When I put the eggs in.

51:07.983 --> 51:09.443
Then I passed out.

51:09.776 --> 51:12.279
- I woke up here.
- Here, Charlie.

51:15.741 --> 51:17.868
Is, uh...
Is this from Earth?

51:18.493 --> 51:19.828
Yeah, it's a driver's license.

51:20.037 --> 51:21.580
<i>See? Grover's Bend.</i>

51:23.373 --> 51:25.292
Well, where else
would it be from?

51:25.959 --> 51:27.044
But, um...

51:28.211 --> 51:30.130
Charlie, it says you expired.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.591
No.

51:33.592 --> 51:34.926
It's next year.

51:38.638 --> 51:41.558
No, Charlie.
This is like 53 years ago.

51:43.852 --> 51:45.937
No, that's 1993.
That's next year.

51:47.230 --> 51:50.484
Charlie, you've been floating
around in that pod

51:50.692 --> 51:52.235
for over half a century.

51:53.403 --> 51:55.280
<i>Charlie, we're nowhere
near Earth.</i>

51:57.699 --> 51:58.700
Nowhere...

52:00.327 --> 52:01.787
No.

52:02.746 --> 52:04.414
53...

52:10.087 --> 52:11.421
Well, uh...

52:12.964 --> 52:14.508
That means...

52:16.384 --> 52:18.136
everybody I know is...

52:18.512 --> 52:20.013
They're dead.

52:21.181 --> 52:22.516
They're toast.

52:23.350 --> 52:24.851
<i>They're history.</i>

52:28.021 --> 52:31.233
Oh. Okay.

52:32.359 --> 52:33.193
Just...

52:36.321 --> 52:38.240
Yeah, well...

52:38.448 --> 52:40.325
I can live with that.

52:53.088 --> 52:56.216
- He's telling the truth, Bernie.
- Sure.

52:57.342 --> 53:00.428
<i>Eggs from Earth?
Killer furballs?</i>

53:00.929 --> 53:01.805
Ethan,

53:02.681 --> 53:04.808
it is a little hard to believe.

53:23.076 --> 53:24.828
<i>Good morning, Dr. McCormick.</i>

53:25.245 --> 53:27.289
<i>It's good to hear
from you again.</i>

53:28.707 --> 53:31.001
Al Bert, I found this
in the lab I told you about.

53:31.251 --> 53:32.460
You know,
before we got garbaged.

53:33.086 --> 53:34.504
Let me see that.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.303
Move over.

53:56.860 --> 53:58.653
Log retrieval confirmed.

53:58.904 --> 54:00.030
A number of experiments
have been

54:00.280 --> 54:01.948
concluded since last week.

54:02.157 --> 54:03.909
Of the hybrids,
the most successful

54:04.117 --> 54:05.785
<i>so far has been the syphalloids.</i>

54:05.994 --> 54:09.414
It is proved the most resistant
in nearly every test scenario

54:09.623 --> 54:12.918
and has a very high
aggression factor.

54:13.126 --> 54:16.046
<i>Our forced maturity tests
with the metabolic accelerator</i>

54:16.254 --> 54:17.380
<i>have proven most successful.</i>

54:49.371 --> 54:50.497
What is that?

54:59.005 --> 55:00.882
However, so far
we have not been able

55:01.091 --> 55:03.301
to make it
self-reproducing.

55:03.510 --> 55:05.053
Projections demonstrate

55:05.262 --> 55:08.932
that a planetary drop of 1,000
syphalloids could efficiently

55:09.140 --> 55:11.142
<i>- eliminate all other life forms</i>
- Holy...

55:11.351 --> 55:14.229
and clear a target property
in as little as two months,

55:14.437 --> 55:16.982
if we can develop the means
to make them replicate.

55:17.274 --> 55:19.109
Therefore,
as all the other artificials

55:19.317 --> 55:21.069
tend to deconstruct
after a few days,

55:21.278 --> 55:23.530
I recommend
the continuation of funding

55:23.738 --> 55:25.615
in order to locate
a naturally existing

55:25.824 --> 55:28.118
self-replicating
predator species

55:28.368 --> 55:30.078
until, and unless

55:30.287 --> 55:32.914
<i>the syphalloids prove
more viable.</i>

55:34.082 --> 55:36.543
End of log report
dated 3-11-43.

55:37.794 --> 55:40.463
I don't know what this place is,

55:40.672 --> 55:43.591
but I don't think

55:43.800 --> 55:45.260
that we should be here anymore.

55:46.303 --> 55:49.848
Goddamn corporate sleazebags.
I don't believe this.

55:50.098 --> 55:54.269
Al Bert, they will be here
in a couple more hours.

55:54.477 --> 55:56.187
<i>- Take it easy.</i>
- So what?

55:57.022 --> 55:59.566
I vote we get
the fuck out of here now.

55:59.774 --> 56:01.484
No, wait a minute.
Where's Bernie?

56:19.627 --> 56:21.629
God, let it work.

56:48.490 --> 56:50.533
We got all of the flavors.

57:46.214 --> 57:47.173
<i>Is that him?</i>

58:02.439 --> 58:03.606
- Bernie?
- Shit!

58:04.899 --> 58:07.402
Oh, man.
What?!

58:07.610 --> 58:11.906
You know...
those man-eating hairballs

58:12.115 --> 58:13.700
that you do not believe in?

58:13.908 --> 58:15.034
<i>Yeah, what about them?</i>

58:15.243 --> 58:19.706
Well, I am reading
two life forms on your level

58:19.914 --> 58:22.500
<i>- that could be them.</i>
- Where?

58:23.960 --> 58:24.752
I don't know.

58:25.503 --> 58:28.006
<i>But I do know that they
are real close.</i>

58:28.214 --> 58:31.468
<i>And Bernie, I think
that you should get up here,</i>

58:31.718 --> 58:33.720
and I do mean now.

58:33.928 --> 58:36.264
<i>All right.
In a minute, in a minute.</i>

58:39.684 --> 58:42.145
Bernie, do you copy?

58:42.479 --> 58:45.023
Get back up here double quick.

58:53.114 --> 58:54.616
<i>Bernie, do you copy?</i>

59:01.915 --> 59:02.832
<i>Bernie?</i>

59:05.543 --> 59:06.252
<i>Bernie?!</i>

59:06.753 --> 59:09.255
- It's them.
- Bernie, damn it!

59:28.942 --> 59:29.776
What's happening?

59:34.572 --> 59:36.533
Hold it. Hold it,
wait a second.

59:36.741 --> 59:38.409
- Come on. Quick.
- Hold it!

59:39.118 --> 59:39.869
Come on.

59:42.038 --> 59:43.873
Now, they'll come
at your face...

59:50.296 --> 59:51.673
and at your throat.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:00.557
- Keep this up in front of you.
- Come on.

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.232

See if he's still breathing.

01:00:32.422 --> 01:00:33.548
<i>Ugh.</i>

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:36.593
Look.

01:00:40.513 --> 01:00:41.639
<i>They're still wet.</i>

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:46.144

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.479
That's not normal.

01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:51.441
No shit, Sherlock.

01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:55.153
No, I mean they don't
usually turn from a fight.

01:00:56.863 --> 01:00:57.655
Or a meal.

01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:02.702
I'm leaving.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:06.873
You folks want to stay
that's fine with me.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:08.374

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:11.127

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:36.194
<i>are being sealed
due to a code 9 emergency.</i>

01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:45.119
I thought you said
there was no radiation danger.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.538
Well, Fran,
maybe the nuclear core

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.582
just changed its mind.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:52.710
Hey...

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:56.589
<i>For your safety and comfort,</i>

01:01:56.798 --> 01:01:58.758
<i>please return to your stations.</i>

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:01.928
<i>There is a radiation hazard
on decks 6 through 9.</i>

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.556
<i>Please return
to your duty stations.</i>

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:08.726
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please return to your stations.</i>

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:10.645
- Go!
<i>- This is a code 9.</i>

01:02:11.229 --> 01:02:13.272
<i>Please return to your stations.</i>

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.322
Okay, come on.

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:08.453
- Go.
- Go.

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:10.246
- Go.
- Get your ass down there!

01:03:45.114 --> 01:03:47.366
- What are these?
<i>- Those are eggs.</i>

01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:48.659
<i>They've been busy.</i>

01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:54.832
- Fran, come on.
- We got to get out of here now.

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.042
<i>Cut it out, Fran.</i>

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.881
Hey, they take
six months to incubate.

01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.883
Fran!

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:08.262
Let's get out of here.

01:04:23.152 --> 01:04:24.028
Charlie!

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:29.450
Come on.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.536
<i>Please return to your stations.</i>

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:32.912
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.790
<i>Levels 5 through 11
are now sealed.</i>

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:39.961
<i>We're here.</i>

01:04:41.254 --> 01:04:42.964
- What?
- We're here.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:10.867
<i>Al Bert, we just can't jump.</i>

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:12.159
<i>We got to unlock.</i>

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:14.203
- Ethan, engineering.
- What?

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:15.830
- Fran...
- I got it.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:18.165
- Charlie!
- Yeah.

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:21.127
Okay, with me.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:28.759
This...

01:05:32.138 --> 01:05:33.723
is a genuine

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:38.102
antique Colt.45.

01:05:38.311 --> 01:05:41.230
Used to be the most
powerful handgun on Earth.

01:05:42.231 --> 01:05:42.940
Charlie,

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:45.902
<i>it's all we've got.</i>

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:47.862
<i>We're a salvage operation.</i>

01:05:49.697 --> 01:05:51.866
<i>Do you actually know
how to shoot one of these things?</i>

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:52.700
Well...

01:05:55.703 --> 01:05:57.496
I'm a.38 Special man myself.

01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:02.835
You do have bullets for it?

01:06:15.306 --> 01:06:16.432
I've always sort of wondered

01:06:16.641 --> 01:06:18.476
if one of these things
would actually fire.

01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:19.560
Yeah.

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:22.438
I'm used to getting
a dud now and again.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:41.916
- Move.
<i>- This tin can's</i>

01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:44.377
<i>gonna move
like it's never done before.</i>

01:06:44.585 --> 01:06:46.504
- Watch out, Charlie.
<i>- Main thrusters in line.</i>

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:47.755
<i>25 mark.</i>

01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:50.424
<i>25 is set.</i>

01:06:52.969 --> 01:06:54.720
Nav-con is on hold.

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:15.783
- Get it yet, Fran?
- Nearly ready.

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:22.415
- Did you do that?
- Of course not.

01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:24.917
<i>I'm fast, but not that fast.</i>

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:29.255
- Ethan!
- Yeah, what?

01:07:29.714 --> 01:07:31.215
- Did you...
- What?

01:07:31.424 --> 01:07:32.508
Never mind.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.246
No! Please, Charlie.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:06.876
Charlie!

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:10.755
Please tell me
he is not shooting

01:08:10.963 --> 01:08:12.423
<i>a gun in here.</i>

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.433
I got him.
I got him good.

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:23.642
I got him.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.647
<i>Hey, I got him!</i>

01:08:28.856 --> 01:08:30.483
Oh, got him good!

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.787
Aww.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:46.290
<i>No.</i>

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:53.380
Congratulations, Charlie,

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:57.051
you have just murdered the ship.

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:01.096
But I got him.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.390
<i>Can't we just, you know,</i>

01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:06.060
go to the next dock over?

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:10.231
Get another ship?

01:09:11.107 --> 01:09:13.359
No, this is our ship.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.154
It's the only ship, you idiot!

01:09:19.657 --> 01:09:22.576
Holy shit. O-okay.

01:09:23.536 --> 01:09:24.411
I can live with that.

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:27.706
But I got him.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:33.587
But I see what you're saying
about it being the only ship.

01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:36.549
Okay.

01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:40.136
Rick and Bernie are dead.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.095
For all I know,
we may have been

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.598
infected by some
alien goddamn germ.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:48.727
So, unless anyone else
has another suggestion,

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.147
I propose
that we just hole up here

01:09:51.397 --> 01:09:53.149
and wait for them
to come rescue us.

01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:56.068
<i>They will be here any minute.</i>

01:09:56.402 --> 01:09:57.319
Yeah.

01:09:58.654 --> 01:10:00.114
If we don't blow up first.

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:23.762
Thanks, Charlie.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:32.396
So much for Earth.

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.066
<i>Nope, there.
The one with the wires.</i>

01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:39.820
<i>Okay.</i>

01:10:42.448 --> 01:10:44.491
<i>No. Come on, Charlie.</i>

01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:49.914
<i>Goddamn it.
This thing is fried.</i>

01:10:50.122 --> 01:10:51.290
It's gone.

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:55.628
Where the hell
does he think he's going?

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:02.885
What are you doing?
You get your ass back here!

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.428
Hey!

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.138
I've got something
to take care of.

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.682
We need you back in here.

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:11.852
Look, there's one left.
I'm going to go take care of it.

01:11:12.186 --> 01:11:15.105
<i>- Leave it be!</i>
- You're not my father!

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:29.526
Al Bert.

01:15:30.319 --> 01:15:31.153
Company.

01:15:33.322 --> 01:15:36.283
All right! Come on,
Charlie, let's go, let's go.

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:41.622
<i>Docking complete.</i>

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:46.543
<i>Welcome TerraCor ship
to TerraCor station 44.</i>

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:49.796
<i>- You may call me Angela.</i>
- Hey, hold it, hold it.

01:15:50.005 --> 01:15:54.218
<i>Please complete decontamination
procedures before disembarking.</i>

01:15:59.223 --> 01:16:01.850
You are the crew
of the RSS Tesla?

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:03.519
Yeah.

01:16:04.853 --> 01:16:06.230
What's left of it.

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:11.735
Ug?

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:15.113
- Is that you?
<i>- No further.</i>

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:20.327
Ug...
It's me, it's Charlie.

01:16:25.457 --> 01:16:26.959
Who is this guy?

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:29.962
He's my friend.

01:16:31.672 --> 01:16:33.799
I mean, he was my friend.

01:16:36.385 --> 01:16:37.427
He is.

01:16:41.098 --> 01:16:42.182
Where are the eggs?

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:44.268
<i>Look here,</i>

01:16:45.394 --> 01:16:46.603
I don't know
who you think you are

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:47.854
or what your game is...

01:16:49.523 --> 01:16:50.190
Hey!

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.485
<i>What the hell
do you think you're doing</i>

01:16:53.694 --> 01:16:57.823
<i>coming in here with your
goddamn stormtroopers?!</i>

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:03.579
Get the guns out of my face.

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:07.624
You do not pull
that stuff on us, get it?!

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.543
<i>What's your problem?</i>

01:17:10.168 --> 01:17:12.796
You overstep your bounds.

01:17:31.523 --> 01:17:33.066
<i>Where are the Crite specimens?</i>

01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:35.861
Ug, what...?

01:17:36.153 --> 01:17:39.573
Don't! Don't tell him
anything, Charlie.

01:17:39.948 --> 01:17:41.408
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

01:17:44.453 --> 01:17:46.622
Someone must cooperate.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.044
You will die next.

01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:55.714
Screw... you.

01:18:02.638 --> 01:18:05.515
You three start on this level,
then search deck eight.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:07.726
Report to me
when you've found the eggs.

01:18:17.653 --> 01:18:19.571
I guess you got
a promotion, huh?

01:18:23.367 --> 01:18:25.160
Things change, Charlie.

01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:28.538
<i>Things change.</i>

01:18:33.877 --> 01:18:35.295
Recon formation, guys.

01:18:35.504 --> 01:18:36.546
Stay hot.

01:19:09.496 --> 01:19:13.709
Angela, do not, repeat,
do not close and secure

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:16.128
door number 16 on level four.

01:19:18.046 --> 01:19:18.922
Yes!

01:19:21.633 --> 01:19:23.802
Pulsars on nine.
Stay close.

01:19:25.721 --> 01:19:26.555
This way.

01:19:28.557 --> 01:19:32.561
Angela, do not close
door number 21 on level four.

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:36.732
Angela, emergency drill.
Do not comply.

01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:47.617
<i>We're being handled, sir.</i>

01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:49.828
I know, the computer's doing it.

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.263
Angela, emergency drill.

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:13.351
Do not close and secure
door number 26 on level four.

01:20:48.303 --> 01:20:50.263
Deck four, sir.
We're at the lab.

01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:04.820
We had a reading here.

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.113
47, guys.

01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:27.384
Oh!

01:21:33.473 --> 01:21:34.850
They're blast doors, sir!

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:37.561
Okay, close up.

01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:39.187
Look sharp.

01:21:57.956 --> 01:22:00.667
- Yes!
<i>- Get him... aaah!</i>

01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:02.085
<i>Get him, get him!</i>

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:10.427
Where are they?!

01:22:25.233 --> 01:22:26.318
<i>Attention.</i>

01:22:26.526 --> 01:22:28.695
<i>The nuclear core
has become unstable.</i>

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.448
<i>There is a danger
of critical mass in 10...</i>

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:32.324
<i>10 minutes.</i>

01:22:32.532 --> 01:22:33.283
Huh?

01:22:36.036 --> 01:22:37.746
<i>Commencing countdown.</i>

01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:39.915
<i>Please evacuate all...</i>

01:22:40.415 --> 01:22:41.499
<i>You hear that?</i>

01:22:41.833 --> 01:22:44.461
<i>We're gonna die in 10 minutes!</i>

01:22:48.173 --> 01:22:50.425
<i>Ug, listen to me.
You're being pig-headed.</i>

01:22:50.634 --> 01:22:52.802
<i>The critters are probably
all the way to Earth by now.</i>

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:54.471
Ug?

01:22:58.892 --> 01:23:01.603
<i>Then your time has run out.</i>

01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:09.861
Oh, wow.

01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:11.821
Hey, did I hear
you wanted these?

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.739
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.158
Well, keep your eyes on 'em.

01:23:15.867 --> 01:23:17.118
These are the last ones, see?

01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.829
<i>Your guards, they uh...</i>

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:21.331
They kinda screwed up.

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:22.332
- Ohhh.
<i>- Don't worry,</i>

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.500
<i>I'm real good at this.</i>

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.461
Sometimes... I just...

01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:29.631
I can't quite seem to...

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:33.051
Get it right.

01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:47.857
- Oww.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:49.567
Yeah.

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:53.279
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:54.531
Wait a minute,
can you fly this ship?

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:58.451
It's probably 90% automated.

01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:01.121
- Does that mean yes?
- It means, Ethan...

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:02.789
<i>in that ship we can probably</i>

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:05.375
make it to Earth
in two months or less.

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:08.211
Right. Come on, Charlie.
Let's go.

01:24:11.339 --> 01:24:12.507
I'll be right there!

01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:15.593
Ethan, come on,
let's get out of here!

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:31.860
Oh, God.

01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:05.769
Chill out...

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:07.771
asshole.

01:25:56.736 --> 01:25:59.072
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:15.213
That's a nice antique, Charlie.

01:26:16.923 --> 01:26:20.135
- Does it work?
- You bet.

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:32.313
Now let him go, Ug.

01:26:34.023 --> 01:26:35.775
<i>You can't do it, Charlie.</i>

01:26:36.151 --> 01:26:37.735
You never could.

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:42.782
Things change, Ug.

01:27:03.845 --> 01:27:05.180
<i>Things change.</i>

01:27:13.771 --> 01:27:15.106
So do people.

01:27:20.153 --> 01:27:21.571
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:22.739
<i>Hear this.</i>

01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:25.366
<i>The nuclear core will cause
the station to vaporize</i>

01:27:25.575 --> 01:27:27.285
<i>in three and a half minutes.</i>

01:27:29.537 --> 01:27:30.955
Can we get out of here now?

01:27:31.164 --> 01:27:32.081
- <i>For your listening pleasure,</i>
- Go!

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:33.541
<i>I have selected a music track</i>

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.919
<i>with a running time
of three minutes.</i>

01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:37.128
Hustle, guys.

01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:40.715
Come on!

01:27:42.008 --> 01:27:43.218
Oh, man.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.263
How the hell does
this thing work?

01:27:47.472 --> 01:27:48.097
Here, Charlie.

01:27:50.475 --> 01:27:52.310
- <i>Strap in.</i>
- Okay.

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:57.315
I hope...

01:28:05.073 --> 01:28:05.990
<i>Oh, whoa.</i>

01:28:13.081 --> 01:28:14.791
<i>10 seconds to detonation.</i>

01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:16.459
<i>Have a good day.</i>

01:28:16.793 --> 01:28:18.086
<i>Nine seconds.</i>

01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:19.003
<i>- Eight...</i>
- Angela,

01:28:19.212 --> 01:28:20.088
you are the stupidest

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:21.339
- machine ever built.
<i>- Seven...</i>

01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:23.591
<i>Thank you, but I am not able</i>

01:28:23.758 --> 01:28:26.344
<i>to accept compliments
from waste material.</i>

01:28:26.552 --> 01:28:28.596
<i>Five seconds.
Four seconds...</i>

01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.311
<i>Ha!</i>

01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:39.482
<i>Oh.</i>

01:28:39.774 --> 01:28:40.733
<i>Figures.</i>

01:28:41.234 --> 01:28:42.652
She couldn't tell time either.

01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:51.577
You okay?

01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.832
Hell no.

01:29:03.256 --> 01:29:04.924
We're on autopilot...

01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:06.926
Which is how I like to be.

01:29:08.636 --> 01:29:10.221
<i>On course for Earth, guys.</i>

01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:12.223
<i>Better check this baby out.</i>

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:13.433
Can I help?

01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:15.601
Yeah.

01:29:20.648 --> 01:29:21.399
Charlie...

01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:24.986
<i>- Now don't you touch anything.</i>
- No.

01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:16.829
Captain Charles McFadden.
