- Everything.

- Temperance, this is delicious.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.098
The garbanzo palau is in honor
of your time in Afghanistan.

01:03.189 --> 01:05.305
Garbanzos are also very good for pregnancy.

Woodland is some creepy neighborhood.

01:47.066 --> 01:49.273
[ Booth ] Yeah, someone dies around here,
it’s 90% gang related.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.318
[ Brennan ] Is that an actual
statistic or one of your
illustrative descriptions?

01:52.405 --> 01:54.396
Definitely the second one.
Definitely the second.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.573
- [ Saroyan ] The tree actually
grew through the victim.
- [ Booth ] Oh, ho!

01:57.660 --> 02:00.367
[ Hodgins ] Cornus flor/da.
More commonly known
as the flowering dogwood.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.538
[ Booth ] How long does it take
for the roots of a tree to grow
through a skull? Hundred years?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.913
Well, the modern zipper
was invented in 1913.

02:08.004 --> 02:09.960
The skeleton is still articulated,

02:10.047 --> 02:11.958
so she hasn’t been here
longer than two years.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.752
She?
Yes, it’s a female.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.834
My turn. The human remains—

02:15.928 --> 02:19.921
one week on the surface
equals about eight weeks in a shallow grave.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.132
I’d estimate three weeks to one year.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.559
Okay, bug boy, you’re up.
Find a bug and tell me time of death.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.434
No can do. Carrion feeding insects
have less access to bodies underground.

02:29.525 --> 02:33.768
But there could be some evidence
in the growth patterns of the tree...

02:36.073 --> 02:37.984
You mean when it might
have been very fertilized?

02:38.075 --> 02:41.784
Okay. That’s it. Tree back to the lab.
I get it. They’re not gonna like this one.

02:41.871 --> 02:46.365
High narrow nasal root
and straight profile, Caucasian.

02:46.459 --> 02:49.826
Yeah. It’s Booth.
Listen, I need a 24-foot flatbed.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.172
I gotta transport a tree.
Yeah, that’s right. A tree.

[ Brennan ]
Excellent dental work.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.212
Expensive.
[ Saroyan ]
Oh, rich white woman.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.794
She would’ve stood out
in this neighborhood like a lighthouse.

02:59.889 --> 03:05.179
I estimate height
at 1.75 to 1.8 meters tall.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.351
Between 5’8” and 5’9”.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.679
[ Brennan ]
Athletic, well muscled.

03:09.774 --> 03:15.644
- Let’s estimate weight at 63 kilograms.
- 140 pounds.

03:15.738 --> 03:19.230
So basically the same height
and weight as you, huh, Bones?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.201
Oh.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.619
Oh, what?

03:30.252 --> 03:31.241
Nothing.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.202
God, that garbanzo thing
totally worked.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.249
If you wanna be
in charge of my nutrition...

04:13.337 --> 04:14.577
for the entire pregnancy,

04:14.672 --> 04:16.082
you’ve got the job.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.336
Except I do need pastries,
a lot of pastries.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.088
Sugar stresses your pancreas.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.295
Okay. You are not really here.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.302
So what’s the story,
morning glory?

04:27.393 --> 04:29.008
I don’t know what that means.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.934
It means you’re behaving strangely,

04:31.021 --> 04:33.512
and I’m asking you why.

04:35.651 --> 04:39.269
The victim.
Does she remind you of anyone?

04:39.363 --> 04:43.982
Sweetie, when you describe people
in generalities, like age and size,

04:44.076 --> 04:46.408
it fits a lot of people.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.328
Your dolphin ring. So what?

04:53.419 --> 04:54.704
It’s not mine.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.542
It’s the victim’s.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.497
Oh.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.551
Okay, well, granted,
that is— that is a little bit freaky.

05:03.637 --> 05:08.552
But, I mean, technically,
a lot of people like dolphins.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.133
And unless you get
yourjewelry custom made,

05:11.228 --> 05:14.891
there could be hundreds of people
wearing what I’m wearing right now.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.477
You’re making sense.

05:23.449 --> 05:24.859
Okay.

05:28.245 --> 05:32.614
[ Brennan ] There’s a longitudinal fracture
to the right temporal bone.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.365
Cause of death?
Yes.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.701
Deep enough
to suggest a fatal blow.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.037
Severe nightstick fracture to the left ulna,

05:40.132 --> 05:43.750
suggesting the victim raised
her arms in a defensive posture.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.336
She was beaten to death.
Fits the neighborhood.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.341
I removed this
from the remains last night.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.974
I noted it in the evidence log,
but I forgot to hand it over.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.851
It’s not like you to forget things.

05:57.942 --> 06:00.809
The ring isn’t likely
to be probative evidence
in a murder charge.

06:00.903 --> 06:04.361
Well, it might help us with identification.
This looks really familiar.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.030
Angela says it’s a very
common piece ofjewelry.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.701
Notice the bony growths
on the third and fourth fingers.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.403
Medial phalanges.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.280
Occupational markers?
Yes.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.122
Usually caused
by using tools in this manner.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.124
Seamstress. Some kind of artist.

06:21.215 --> 06:25.504
I bet you and I both have that same
occupational marker on our fingers.

06:25.594 --> 06:29.633
We should add “medical professional”
to the list of possibilities.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.061
Have you found anything
interesting, Dr. Hodgins?

06:38.148 --> 06:41.276
There’s something funky about the leaves.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.693
Funky means “bad smelling”
or, when applied to music,

06:44.780 --> 06:46.691
“marked by an earthy,
bluesy quality.”

06:46.782 --> 06:50.240
In this case, funky means “weird.”

06:50.327 --> 06:51.828
Meanwhile, look at this.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.488
The rings correspond to seasons.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.495
Now, the wide rings develop
during a tree’s growing season.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.004
When the tree gets
maximum nutrients.
Right.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.046
And the skinny rings develop during
the winter when a tree grows more slowly.

07:04.133 --> 07:07.125
But note here—
two wide rings in a row,

07:07.219 --> 07:10.461
suggesting that last winter,
this tree was particularly well fed.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.296
The victim’s decomposing body.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.473
Yes. Which brings us to the roots.

07:17.688 --> 07:21.476
This root was probably damaged
when the body was buried.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.057
About 11 months ago.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.393
Last November.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.066
[Hannah]
It gets you every single time.

07:32.161 --> 07:35.528
The slow clap. You get misty.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.659
That holds no meaning for me.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.083
Like in the movies when the hero,
he takes a big chance.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.286
[Hannah]
Makes a speech.
Stands up to authority.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.632
An old guy gets up.
He starts clapping.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.128
Really slow at first,
and then everybody joins in.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.470
The slow clap.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.215
Have you |.D.’d the victim yet?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.137
Ah, the description
was too general.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.135
Yes, even though
Cam and I discovered...

07:56.226 --> 07:58.217
that she was very likely a surgeon.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.395
- How’s that?
- Occupational markers on the phalanges.

08:01.482 --> 08:05.521
Uh, a surgeon
named Dr. Lauren Eames
disappeared last November.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.317
I checked Bing.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.690
DC. Metro missing persons
investigated.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.568
The case went cold.
It didn’t go anywhere.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.617
How can that be?
The woman was a surgeon.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.319
Single, no kids.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.702
Outside of people at work,
there was no one to miss her.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.584
I brought along
Lauren’s schedule...

08:27.675 --> 08:29.506
for the six months
before she died.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.255
Her caseload. Her interns.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.679
It’s everything I can provide
without contravening
patient confidentiality.

08:35.808 --> 08:39.767
Dr. Eames have any enemies?
No. Lauren was not
a woman of passion.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.141
Some residents complained
they were overworked
and underappreciated,

08:43.232 --> 08:44.688
but nothing out of the ordinary.

08:44.817 --> 08:48.526
Like you and your
squinterns there, hey, Bones?
No, I appreciate them.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.603
Eh. So what about her personal life?

08:51.365 --> 08:52.775
Look at her schedule.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.152
Lauren didn’t have any time
for a personal life.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.700
Rumors? Nothing?

08:56.787 --> 08:59.449
The Transplant Services
helicopter team.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.280
Sounds scandalous.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.081
I heard the pilot
had a thing for Lauren.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.454
Unrequited.
Lots of sexual tension.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.169
You got a name?
Chris Markham.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.918
What are these, please?

09:11.009 --> 09:13.091
Dr. Eames’s case files.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.339
She dictated them
for transcription.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.797
lthought
maybe if you heard her voice—

09:17.891 --> 09:20.928
Why? It’s the content that matters,
not the tone of voice.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.391
Lauren was the best cardiac surgeon
on the eastern seaboard.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.598

09:27.693 --> 09:28.978
Why?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.184
We—

09:31.196 --> 09:33.403
- We didn’t hear about it.
- Excuse me?

09:33.490 --> 09:36.857
Dr. Brennan just wonders why someone
of that importance could just disappear.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.283
So—

09:39.121 --> 09:40.531
So quietly.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.330
“I will show you fear
in a handful of dust.”

09:47.129 --> 09:48.619
T.S. Eliot.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.918
We don’t actually fear death.

09:52.009 --> 09:56.628
We fear that no one
will notice our absence,

09:56.722 --> 09:59.179
that we will disappear without a trace.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.017
That sounds correct.

Mm-hmm.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.750

10:30.506 --> 10:33.498
Oh, she looks nice, but no.
No one I know.

Hello, Micah.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.567
You awake because
you’re intellectually invigorated...

11:39.658 --> 11:41.068
or because you’re worried?

11:41.159 --> 11:43.411
I’m awake because I can’t sleep.

11:43.495 --> 11:47.488
I’m having trouble being objective
regarding this case.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.325
I attended this lecture
where this philosopher guy says...

11:50.419 --> 11:51.955
that for something to be objective...

11:52.045 --> 11:53.785
it must be separate from the mind.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.462
And nothing
is separate from the mind.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.414
Ergo, ipso facto, Colombo, Oreo.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.296
Not all of that was real Latin, Micah.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.720
Maybe for a little change, you could try
solving a case without being objective.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.298
No. If there’s no such thing as objectivity,

12:06.393 --> 12:08.725
then there’s no such thing
as measurement,

12:08.812 --> 12:11.519
which means
that empiricism is meaningless.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.486
I’m all right now.
[Laughs]

38:44.573 --> 38:46.234
Except I—

38:48.118 --> 38:50.109
I made a mistake.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.534
No, I told you my opinion.
I mean, you got it right.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.786
Not everything.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.418
She died with regrets.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.842
Come on. Bones,
everybody has regrets.

39:06.929 --> 39:10.421
[Laughs]
I heard her, you know?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.140
Micah says that all we get are these—
[Laughs]

39:17.231 --> 39:20.394
dim, staticky messages
from the universe.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.775
[ Exhales ]
Who’s this Micah guy?

39:23.862 --> 39:27.480
The night watchman.
But he attends a lot of lectures.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.735
Anyway, the point is,

39:30.661 --> 39:33.368
she never gave him a chance.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.905
Micah.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.661
No. No. The helicopter pilot.

39:38.752 --> 39:43.746
He offered himself to her,
but she never gave him a chance.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.461
That was her regret.

39:50.264 --> 39:53.472
I got the signal, Booth.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.634
I don’t want to have any regrets.

40:06.530 --> 40:09.772
Um, I’m with someone,

40:11.827 --> 40:13.863
Bones.

40:13.954 --> 40:16.912
And Hannah,
she’s not a consolation prize.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.455
I love her.

[ Sobbing ]

40:24.006 --> 40:25.962
[Sobbing Continues]

40:26.049 --> 40:29.541
The last thing
I want to do is hurt you,
but those are the facts.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.050
I understand.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.683
I missed my chance.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.986
[ Sniffles ]

40:50.073 --> 40:53.531
[Laughs]
My whole world turned upside down.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.200
I can adjust.

40:57.414 --> 40:58.904
I did.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.458
Yes, you did.
[Laughs]

41:06.882 --> 41:10.716
Do you want me to, uh—
to call someone to be with you or—

41:13.805 --> 41:16.137
No, I’m fine alone.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.727
Thanks.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.312
[Sighs]

41:46.797 --> 41:48.753
How’d it work out?

41:51.134 --> 41:53.671
I listened to the universe.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.799
[Laughs]
I felt something.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.185
I’m sad.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.351
That’s so much better
than dead.
[Laughs]

42:07.442 --> 42:09.649
Or even dead inside.

42:09.736 --> 42:12.478
Did you hear that in the lecture?

42:13.615 --> 42:15.606
I got my own story, Dr. Brennan.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.113
Just like you. Just like everybody.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.444
I got my own sad story.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.446
[Sighs]

43:05.083 --> 43:07.324
Three days.

43:09.337 --> 43:12.625
Three days for the world
to turn right side up again.

What’s that mean?
